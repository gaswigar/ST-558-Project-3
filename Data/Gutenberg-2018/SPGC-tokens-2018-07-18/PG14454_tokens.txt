a
postscript
by

part
the
first
chapter
the
first
an
open
door
i
think
i
was
as
nearly
mad
as
i
could
be
nearer
madness
i
believe
than
i
shall
ever
be
again
thank
god
three
weeks
of
it
had
driven
me
to
the
very
verge
of
desperation
i
can
not
say
here
what
had
brought
me
to
this
pass
for
i
do
not
know
into
whose
hands
these
pages
may
fall
but
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
persist
in
a
certain
line
of
conduct
which
i
firmly
believed
to
be
right
while
those
who
had
authority
over
me
and
were
stronger
than
i
was
were
resolutely
bent
upon
making
me
submit
to
their
will
the
conflict
had
been
going
on
more
or
less
violently
for
months
now
i
had
come
very
near
the
end
of
it
i
felt
that
i
must
either
yield
or
go
mad
there
was
no
chance
of
my
dying
i
was
too
strong
for
that
there
was
no
other
alternative
than
subjection
or
insanity
it
had
been
raining
all
the
day
long
in
a
ceaseless
driving
torrent
which
had
kept
the
streets
clear
of
passengers
i
could
see
nothing
but
wet
with
little
pools
of
water
lodging
in
every
hollow
in
which
the
splashed
heavily
whenever
the
storm
grew
more
in
earnest
now
and
then
a
tradesman
cart
or
a
cab
with
their
drivers
wrapped
in
mackintoshes
dashed
past
and
i
watched
them
till
they
were
out
of
my
sight
it
had
been
the
dreariest
of
days
my
eyes
had
followed
the
course
of
solitary
drops
rolling
down
the
until
my
head
ached
toward
nightfall
i
could
distinguish
a
low
wailing
tone
moaning
through
the
air
a
quiet
prelude
to
a
coming
change
in
the
weather
which
was
foretold
also
by
little
rents
in
the
thick
mantle
of
cloud
which
had
shrouded
the
sky
all
day
the
storm
of
rain
was
about
to
be
succeeded
by
a
storm
of
wind
any
change
would
be
acceptable
to
me
there
was
nothing
within
my
room
less
dreary
than
without
i
was
in
london
but
in
what
part
of
london
i
did
not
know
the
house
was
one
of
those
desirable
family
residences
advertised
in
the
as
to
be
let
furnished
and
promising
all
the
comforts
and
refinements
of
a
home
it
was
situated
in
a
though
not
altogether
fashionable
quarter
as
i
judged
by
the
gloomy
monotonous
rows
of
buildings
which
i
could
see
from
my
windows
none
of
which
were
shops
but
all
private
dwellings
the
people
who
passed
up
and
down
the
streets
on
line
days
were
all
of
one
stamp
persons
who
could
afford
to
wear
good
and
handsome
clothes
but
who
were
infinitely
less
interesting
than
the
dear
picturesque
beggars
of
italian
towns
or
the
sprightly
peasantry
of
french
cities
the
rooms
on
the
third
floor
my
rooms
which
i
had
not
been
allowed
to
leave
since
we
entered
the
house
three
weeks
before
were
very
badly
furnished
indeed
with
comfortless
high
chairs
and
a
sofa
of
the
same
uncomfortable
material
cold
and
slippery
on
which
it
was
impossible
to
rest
the
carpet
was
nearly
threadbare
and
the
curtains
of
moreen
were
very
dingy
the
mirror
over
the
seemed
to
have
been
made
purposely
to
distort
my
features
and
produce
in
me
a
feeling
of
depression
my
bedroom
which
communicated
with
this
agreeable
by
was
still
smaller
and
gloomier
and
opened
upon
a
dismal
where
a
dog
in
a
kennel
howled
dejectedly
from
time
to
time
and
rattled
his
chain
as
if
to
remind
me
that
i
was
a
prisoner
like
himself
i
had
no
books
no
work
no
music
it
was
a
dreary
place
to
pass
a
dreary
time
in
and
my
only
resource
was
to
pace
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
from
one
end
to
another
of
those
wretched
rooms
i
watched
the
day
grow
dusk
and
then
dark
the
rifts
in
the
driving
clouds
were
growing
larger
and
the
edges
were
torn
i
left
off
roaming
up
and
down
my
room
like
some
entrapped
creature
and
sank
down
on
the
floor
by
the
window
looking
out
for
the
pale
sad
blue
of
the
sky
which
gleamed
now
and
then
through
the
clouds
till
the
night
had
quite
set
in
i
did
not
cry
for
i
am
not
given
to
overmuch
weeping
and
my
heart
was
too
sore
to
be
healed
by
tears
neither
did
i
tremble
for
i
held
out
my
hand
and
arm
to
make
sure
they
were
steady
but
still
i
felt
as
if
i
were
sinking
down
down
into
an
awful
profound
despondency
from
which
i
should
never
rally
it
was
all
over
with
me
i
had
nothing
before
me
but
to
give
up
and
own
myself
overmatched
and
conquered
i
have
a
that
as
i
crouched
there
in
the
darkness
i
sobbed
once
and
cried
under
my
breath
god
help
me
a
very
slight
sound
grated
on
my
ear
and
a
fresh
thrill
of
strong
resentful
feeling
quivered
all
through
me
it
was
the
hateful
click
of
the
key
turning
in
the
lock
it
gave
me
force
enough
to
carry
out
my
defiance
a
little
longer
before
the
door
could
be
opened
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
stood
erect
and
outwardly
very
calm
gazing
through
the
window
with
my
face
turned
away
from
the
persons
who
were
coming
in
i
was
so
placed
that
i
could
see
them
reflected
in
the
mirror
over
the
fireplace
a
servant
came
first
carrying
in
a
tray
upon
which
were
a
lamp
and
my
tea
such
a
meal
as
might
be
prepared
for
a
in
disgrace
she
came
up
to
me
as
if
to
draw
down
the
blinds
and
close
the
shutters
leave
them
i
said
i
will
do
it
myself
he
not
coming
home
said
a
woman
voice
behind
me
in
a
scoffing
tone
i
could
see
her
too
without
turning
round
a
handsome
woman
with
bold
black
eyes
and
a
rouged
face
which
showed
coarsely
in
the
ugly
she
was
extravagantly
dressed
and
wore
a
profusion
of
ornaments
tawdry
ones
mostly
but
one
or
two
i
recognized
as
my
own
she
was
not
many
years
older
than
myself
i
took
no
notice
whatever
of
her
or
her
words
or
her
presence
but
continued
to
gaze
out
steadily
at
the
streets
and
stormy
sky
her
voice
grew
hoarse
with
passion
and
i
knew
well
how
her
face
would
burn
and
flush
under
the
rouge
it
will
be
no
better
for
you
when
he
is
at
home
she
said
fiercely
he
hates
you
he
swears
so
a
hundred
times
a
day
and
he
is
determined
to
break
your
proud
spirit
for
you
we
shall
force
you
to
knock
under
sooner
or
later
and
i
warn
you
it
will
be
best
for
you
to
be
sooner
rather
than
later
what
friends
have
you
got
anywhere
to
take
your
side
if
you
made
friends
with
me
my
fine
lady
you
have
found
it
good
for
yourself
but
you
chosen
to
make
me
your
enemy
and
i
make
him
your
enemy
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
he
ca
hear
the
sight
of
your
long
puling
face
still
i
did
not
answer
by
word
or
sign
i
set
my
teeth
together
and
gave
no
indication
that
i
had
heard
one
of
her
taunting
speeches
my
silence
only
served
to
fan
her
fury
upon
my
soul
madam
she
almost
shrieked
you
are
enough
to
drive
me
to
murder
i
could
beat
you
standing
there
so
dumb
as
if
i
was
not
worthy
to
speak
a
word
to
ay
and
i
would
but
for
him
so
then
three
weeks
of
this
has
broken
you
down
yet
but
you
are
only
making
it
the
worse
for
yourself
we
shall
try
other
means
she
had
no
idea
how
nearly
my
spirit
was
broken
for
i
gave
her
no
reply
she
came
up
to
where
i
stood
and
shook
her
clinched
hand
in
my
face
a
large
hand
with
bejewelled
fingers
that
could
have
given
me
a
heavy
blow
her
face
was
dark
with
passion
yet
she
was
maintaining
some
control
over
herself
though
with
great
difficulty
she
had
never
struck
me
yet
but
i
trembled
and
shrank
from
her
and
was
thankful
when
she
flung
herself
out
of
the
room
pulling
the
door
violently
after
her
and
locking
it
noisily
as
if
the
harsh
jarring
sounds
would
be
more
terrifying
than
the
tones
of
her
own
voice
left
to
myself
i
turned
round
to
the
light
catching
a
fresh
glimpse
of
my
face
in
the
mirror
a
pale
and
sadder
and
more
forlorn
face
than
before
i
almost
hated
myself
in
that
glass
but
i
was
hungry
for
i
was
young
and
my
health
and
appetite
were
very
good
and
i
sat
down
to
my
plain
fare
and
ate
it
heartily
i
felt
stronger
and
in
better
spirits
by
the
time
i
had
finished
the
meal
i
resolved
to
brave
it
out
a
little
longer
the
house
was
very
quiet
for
at
present
there
was
no
one
in
it
except
the
woman
and
the
servant
who
had
been
up
to
my
room
the
servant
was
a
poor
london
drudge
who
was
left
in
charge
by
the
owners
of
the
house
and
who
had
been
forbidden
to
speak
to
me
after
a
while
i
heard
her
heavy
shambling
footsteps
coming
slowly
up
the
staircase
and
passing
my
door
on
her
way
to
the
attics
above
they
sounded
louder
than
usual
and
i
turned
my
head
round
involuntarily
a
thin
fine
streak
of
light
no
thicker
than
a
thread
shone
for
an
instant
in
the
dark
corner
of
the
wall
close
by
the
but
it
died
away
almost
before
i
saw
it
my
heart
stood
still
for
a
moment
and
then
beat
like
a
hammer
i
stole
very
softly
to
the
door
and
discovered
that
the
bolt
had
slipped
beyond
the
hoop
of
the
lock
probably
in
the
sharp
bang
with
which
it
had
been
closed
the
door
was
open
for
me
chapter
the
second
to
southampton
there
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
when
the
servant
came
downstairs
again
from
her
room
in
the
attics
she
would
be
sure
to
call
for
the
in
order
to
save
herself
another
journey
how
long
she
would
be
was
quite
uncertain
if
she
was
gone
to
clean
herself
as
she
called
it
the
process
might
be
a
very
long
one
and
a
good
hour
might
be
at
my
disposal
but
i
could
not
count
upon
that
in
the
below
sat
my
jailer
and
enemy
who
might
take
a
whim
into
her
head
and
come
up
to
see
her
prisoner
at
any
instant
it
was
necessary
to
be
very
quick
very
decisive
and
very
silent
i
had
been
on
the
alert
for
such
a
chance
ever
since
my
imprisonment
began
my
hat
and
jacket
lay
ready
to
my
hand
in
a
drawer
but
i
could
find
no
gloves
i
could
not
wait
for
gloves
already
there
were
ominous
sounds
overhead
as
if
the
servant
had
dispatched
her
brief
business
there
and
was
about
to
come
down
i
had
not
time
to
put
on
thicker
boots
and
it
was
perhaps
essential
to
the
success
of
my
flight
to
steal
down
the
stairs
in
the
soft
velvet
slippers
i
was
wearing
i
stepped
as
lightly
as
i
could
lightly
but
very
swiftly
for
the
servant
was
at
the
top
of
the
upper
flight
while
i
had
two
to
descend
i
crept
past
the
door
the
heavy
opened
with
a
grating
of
the
hinges
but
i
stood
outside
it
in
the
shelter
of
the
portico
free
but
with
the
rain
and
wind
of
a
stormy
night
in
october
beating
against
me
and
with
no
light
save
the
glimmer
of
the
feeble
flickering
across
the
wet
pavement
i
knew
very
well
that
my
escape
was
almost
hopeless
for
the
success
of
it
depended
very
much
upon
which
road
of
the
three
lying
before
me
i
should
happen
to
take
i
had
no
idea
of
the
direction
of
any
one
of
them
for
i
had
never
been
out
of
the
house
since
the
night
i
was
brought
to
it
the
strong
quick
running
of
the
servant
and
the
passionate
fury
of
the
woman
would
overtake
me
if
we
were
to
have
a
long
race
and
if
they
overtook
me
they
would
force
me
back
i
had
no
right
to
seek
freedom
in
this
wild
way
yet
it
was
the
only
way
even
while
i
hesitated
in
the
portico
of
the
house
that
ought
to
have
been
my
home
i
heard
the
shrill
scream
of
the
girl
within
when
she
found
my
door
open
and
my
room
empty
if
i
did
not
decide
instantaneously
and
decide
aright
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
never
to
have
tried
this
chance
of
escape
but
i
did
not
linger
another
moment
i
could
almost
believe
an
angel
took
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
i
darted
straight
across
the
muddy
road
getting
my
thin
slippers
wet
through
at
once
ran
for
a
few
yards
and
then
turned
sharply
round
a
corner
into
a
street
at
the
end
of
which
i
saw
the
cheery
light
of
all
in
a
glow
in
spite
of
the
rain
on
i
fled
breathlessly
unhindered
by
any
for
the
rain
was
still
falling
though
more
lightly
as
i
drew
nearer
to
the
an
seeing
me
run
toward
him
pulled
up
his
horses
in
expectation
of
a
passenger
the
conductor
shouted
some
name
which
i
did
not
hear
but
i
sprang
in
caring
very
little
where
it
might
carry
me
so
that
i
could
get
quickly
enough
and
far
enough
out
of
the
reach
of
my
pursuers
there
had
been
no
time
to
lose
and
none
was
lost
the
omnibus
drove
on
again
quickly
and
no
trace
was
left
of
me
i
sat
quite
still
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
omnibus
hardly
able
to
recover
my
breath
after
my
rapid
running
i
was
a
little
frightened
at
the
notice
the
two
or
three
other
passengers
appeared
to
take
of
me
and
i
did
my
best
to
seem
calm
and
collected
my
ungloved
hands
gave
me
some
trouble
and
i
hid
them
as
well
as
i
could
in
the
folds
of
my
dress
for
there
was
something
remarkable
about
the
want
of
gloves
in
any
one
as
well
dressed
as
i
was
but
nobody
spoke
to
me
and
one
after
another
they
left
the
omnibus
and
fresh
persons
took
their
places
who
did
not
know
where
i
had
got
in
i
did
not
stir
for
i
determined
to
go
as
far
as
i
could
in
this
conveyance
but
all
the
while
i
was
wondering
what
i
should
do
with
myself
and
where
i
could
go
when
it
readied
its
destination
there
was
one
trifling
difficulty
immediately
ahead
of
me
when
the
omnibus
stopped
i
should
have
no
small
change
for
paying
my
fare
there
was
an
australian
sovereign
fastened
to
my
which
i
could
take
off
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
detach
it
while
we
were
jolting
on
besides
i
dreaded
to
attract
attention
to
myself
yet
what
else
could
i
do
before
i
had
settled
this
question
which
occupied
me
so
fully
that
i
forgot
other
and
more
serious
difficulties
the
omnibus
drove
into
a
and
every
passenger
inside
and
out
prepared
to
alight
i
lingered
till
the
last
and
sat
still
till
i
had
unfastened
my
the
wind
drove
across
the
open
space
in
a
strong
gust
as
i
stepped
down
upon
the
pavement
a
man
had
just
descended
from
the
roof
and
was
paying
the
conductor
a
tall
burly
man
wearing
a
thick
coat
and
a
seaman
hat
of
with
a
long
flap
lying
over
the
back
of
his
neck
his
face
was
brown
and
but
he
had
eyes
which
glanced
at
me
as
i
stood
waiting
to
pay
my
fare
going
down
to
southampton
said
the
conductor
to
him
ay
and
beyond
southampton
he
answered
you
have
a
rough
night
of
it
said
the
sixpence
if
you
please
miss
i
offered
him
my
australian
sovereign
which
he
turned
over
curiously
asking
me
if
i
had
no
smaller
change
he
grumbled
when
i
answered
no
and
the
stranger
who
had
not
passed
on
but
was
listening
to
what
was
said
turned
pleasantly
to
me
you
have
no
change
he
asked
speaking
rather
slowly
as
if
english
was
not
his
ordinary
speech
very
well
are
you
going
to
southampton
yes
by
the
next
train
i
answered
deciding
upon
that
course
without
hesitation
so
am
i
he
said
raising
his
hand
to
his
cap
i
will
pay
this
sixpence
and
you
can
give
it
me
again
when
you
buy
your
ticket
in
the
office
i
smiled
quickly
gladly
and
he
smiled
back
upon
me
but
gravely
as
if
his
face
was
not
used
to
a
smile
i
passed
on
into
the
station
where
a
train
was
standing
and
people
hurrying
about
the
platform
choosing
their
carriages
at
the
they
changed
my
australian
without
a
word
and
i
sought
out
my
seaman
friend
to
return
the
sixpence
he
had
paid
to
me
he
had
done
me
a
greater
kindness
than
he
could
ever
know
and
i
thanked
him
heartily
his
honest
blue
eyes
glistened
under
their
shaggy
eyebrows
as
they
looked
down
upon
me
can
i
do
nothing
more
for
you
he
asked
shall
i
see
after
your
luggage
oh
that
will
be
all
right
thank
you
i
replied
but
is
this
the
train
for
southampton
and
how
soon
will
it
start
i
was
watching
anxiously
the
stream
of
people
going
to
and
fro
lest
i
should
see
some
person
who
knew
me
yet
who
was
there
in
london
who
could
know
me
it
will
be
off
in
five
minutes
answered
the
seaman
shall
i
look
out
a
carriage
for
you
he
was
somewhat
careful
in
making
his
selection
finally
he
put
me
into
a
compartment
where
there
were
only
two
ladies
and
he
stood
in
front
of
the
door
but
with
his
back
turned
toward
it
until
the
train
was
about
to
start
then
he
touched
his
hat
again
with
a
gesture
of
farewell
and
ran
away
to
a
carriage
i
sighed
with
satisfaction
as
the
train
rushed
swiftly
through
the
suburbs
of
london
and
entered
upon
the
open
country
a
wan
watery
line
of
light
lay
under
the
brooding
clouds
in
the
west
tinged
with
a
lurid
hue
and
all
the
great
field
of
sky
stretching
above
the
level
landscape
was
overcast
with
fleeing
swiftly
before
the
wind
at
times
the
train
seemed
to
shake
with
the
wast
when
it
was
passing
oyer
any
embankment
more
than
ordinarily
exposed
but
it
sped
across
the
country
almost
as
rapidly
as
the
clouds
across
the
sky
no
one
in
the
carriage
spoke
then
came
over
me
that
weird
feeling
familiar
to
all
travellers
that
one
has
been
doomed
to
travel
thus
through
many
years
and
has
not
half
accomplished
the
time
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
fleeing
from
my
home
and
those
who
should
have
been
my
friends
for
a
long
and
weary
while
yet
it
was
scarcely
an
hour
since
i
had
made
my
escape
in
about
two
hours
or
more
but
exactly
what
time
i
did
not
know
for
my
watch
had
stopped
my
who
had
scarcely
condescended
to
glance
at
me
alighted
at
a
large
station
where
only
a
few
lamps
were
burning
through
the
window
i
could
see
that
very
few
other
persons
were
leaving
the
train
and
i
concluded
we
had
not
yet
reached
the
terminus
a
porter
came
up
to
me
as
i
leaned
my
head
through
the
window
going
on
miss
he
asked
oh
yes
i
answered
shrinking
back
into
my
he
remained
upon
the
step
with
his
arm
over
the
while
the
train
moved
on
at
a
slackened
pace
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
pulled
up
but
at
no
station
before
me
lay
a
dim
dark
indistinct
scene
with
little
specks
of
light
twinkling
here
and
there
in
the
night
but
whether
on
sea
or
shore
i
could
not
tell
immediately
opposite
the
train
stood
the
black
hulls
and
masts
and
funnels
of
two
steamers
with
a
glimmer
of
lanterns
on
their
decks
and
up
and
down
their
shrouds
the
porter
opened
the
door
for
me
you
only
to
go
on
board
miss
he
said
your
luggage
will
be
seen
to
all
right
and
he
hurried
away
to
open
the
doors
of
the
other
carriages
i
stood
still
utterly
bewildered
for
a
minute
or
two
with
the
wind
tossing
my
hair
about
and
the
rain
beating
in
sharp
stinging
drops
like
hailstones
upon
my
face
and
hands
it
must
have
been
close
upon
midnight
and
there
was
no
light
but
the
dim
glimmer
of
the
lanterns
on
deck
every
one
was
hurrying
past
me
i
began
almost
to
repent
of
the
desperate
step
i
had
taken
but
i
had
learned
already
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
retracing
one
steps
at
the
gangways
of
the
two
vessels
there
were
men
shouting
hoarsely
this
way
for
the
channel
islands
this
way
for
havre
and
paris
to
which
boat
should
i
trust
myself
and
my
fate
there
was
nothing
to
guide
me
yet
once
more
that
night
the
moment
had
come
when
i
was
compelled
to
make
a
prompt
decisive
urgent
choice
it
was
almost
a
question
of
life
and
death
to
me
a
leap
in
the
dark
that
must
be
taken
my
great
terror
was
lest
my
place
of
refuge
should
be
discovered
and
i
be
forced
back
again
where
was
i
to
go
to
paris
or
to
the
channel
islands
chapter
the
third
a
rough
night
at
sea
a
mere
accident
decided
it
near
the
of
the
train
i
saw
the
broad
tall
figure
of
my
new
friend
the
seaman
making
his
way
across
to
the
boat
for
the
channel
islands
and
almost
involuntarily
i
made
up
my
mind
to
go
on
board
the
same
steamer
for
i
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
he
would
prove
a
real
friend
if
i
had
need
of
one
he
did
not
see
me
following
no
doubt
he
supposed
i
had
left
the
train
at
southampton
having
only
taken
my
ticket
so
far
though
how
i
had
missed
southampton
i
could
not
tell
the
deck
was
wet
and
slippery
and
the
confusion
upon
it
was
very
great
i
was
too
much
at
home
upon
a
steamer
to
need
any
directions
and
i
went
down
immediately
into
the
cabin
which
was
almost
empty
and
chose
a
berth
for
myself
in
the
darkest
corner
it
was
not
far
from
the
door
and
presently
two
other
ladies
came
down
with
a
gentleman
and
the
captain
and
held
an
anxious
parley
close
to
me
i
listened
absently
and
mechanically
as
indifferent
to
the
subject
as
if
it
could
be
of
no
consequence
to
me
is
there
any
danger
asked
one
of
the
ladies
well
i
can
not
say
positively
there
will
be
no
danger
answered
the
captain
there
not
danger
enough
to
keep
me
and
the
crew
in
port
but
it
will
be
a
very
dirty
night
in
the
channel
if
there
no
actual
necessity
for
crossing
i
should
advise
you
to
wait
and
see
how
it
will
be
of
course
we
shall
use
extra
caution
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
no
i
can
not
say
i
expect
any
great
danger
but
it
will
be
awfully
rough
said
the
gentleman
the
captain
answered
only
by
a
sound
between
a
groan
and
a
whistle
as
if
he
could
not
trust
himself
to
think
of
words
that
would
describe
the
roughness
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
meaning
the
ladies
hastily
determined
to
drive
back
to
their
hotel
and
gathered
up
their
small
packages
and
wrappings
quickly
i
fancied
they
were
regarding
me
somewhat
curiously
but
i
kept
my
face
away
from
them
carefully
they
could
only
see
my
jacket
and
hat
and
my
rough
hair
and
they
did
not
speak
to
me
you
are
going
to
venture
miss
said
the
captain
stepping
into
the
cabin
as
the
ladies
retreated
up
the
steps
oh
yes
i
answered
i
am
obliged
to
go
and
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
you
need
be
he
replied
in
a
hearty
voice
we
shall
do
our
best
for
our
own
sakes
and
you
would
be
our
first
care
if
there
was
any
mishap
women
and
children
first
always
i
will
send
the
stewardess
to
you
she
goes
of
course
i
sat
down
on
one
of
the
couches
listening
for
a
few
minutes
to
the
noises
about
me
the
masts
were
groaning
and
the
planks
creaking
under
the
heavy
tramp
of
the
sailors
as
they
got
ready
to
start
with
shrill
cries
to
one
another
then
the
began
to
throb
like
a
pulse
through
all
the
vessel
from
stem
to
stern
presently
the
stewardess
came
down
and
recommended
me
to
lie
down
in
my
berth
at
once
which
i
did
very
obediently
but
silently
for
i
did
not
wish
to
enter
into
conversation
with
the
woman
who
seemed
inclined
to
be
talkative
she
covered
me
up
well
with
several
blankets
and
there
i
lay
with
my
face
turned
from
the
light
of
the
swinging
lamp
and
scarcely
moved
hand
or
foot
throughout
the
dismal
and
stormy
night
for
it
was
very
stormy
and
dismal
as
soon
as
we
were
out
of
southampton
waters
and
in
the
rush
and
swirl
of
the
channel
i
did
not
fall
asleep
for
an
instant
i
do
not
suppose
i
should
have
slept
had
the
channel
been
as
it
is
sometimes
smooth
as
a
and
there
had
been
no
clamorous
hissing
and
booming
of
waves
against
the
frail
planks
which
i
could
touch
with
my
hand
i
could
see
nothing
of
the
storm
but
i
could
hear
it
and
the
boat
seemed
tossed
like
a
mere
to
and
fro
upon
the
rough
sea
it
did
not
alarm
me
so
much
as
it
distracted
my
thoughts
and
kept
them
from
dwelling
upon
possibilities
far
more
perilous
to
me
than
the
danger
of
death
by
shipwreck
a
short
suffering
such
a
death
would
be
my
escape
and
flight
had
been
so
unexpected
so
unhoped
for
that
it
had
bewildered
me
and
it
was
almost
a
pleasure
to
lie
still
and
listen
to
the
din
and
uproar
of
the
sea
and
the
swoop
of
the
wind
rushing
down
upon
it
was
i
myself
or
no
was
this
nothing
more
than
a
very
coherent
very
vivid
dream
from
which
i
should
awake
to
find
myself
a
prisoner
still
a
creature
as
wretched
and
friendless
as
any
that
the
streets
of
london
contained
my
flight
had
been
too
extraordinary
a
success
so
far
for
my
mind
to
be
able
to
dwell
upon
it
calmly
i
watched
the
dawn
break
through
a
little
opening
upon
my
berth
which
had
been
washed
and
beaten
by
the
water
all
the
night
long
the
level
light
shone
across
the
troubled
and
surface
of
the
sea
which
seemed
to
grow
a
little
quieter
under
its
touch
i
had
fancied
during
the
night
that
the
waves
were
running
mountains
high
but
now
i
could
see
them
they
only
rolled
to
and
fro
in
round
swelling
hillocks
dull
green
against
the
eastern
sky
with
deep
sullen
troughs
of
a
livid
purple
between
them
but
the
fury
of
the
storm
had
spent
itself
that
was
evident
and
the
steamer
was
making
way
steadily
now
the
stewardess
had
gone
away
early
in
the
night
being
frightened
to
death
she
said
to
seek
more
genial
companionship
than
mine
so
i
was
alone
with
the
blending
light
of
the
early
dawn
and
that
of
the
lamp
burning
feebly
from
the
ceiling
i
sat
up
in
my
berth
and
cautiously
unstitched
the
lining
in
the
breast
of
my
jacket
here
months
ago
when
i
first
began
to
foresee
this
emergency
and
while
i
was
still
allowed
the
use
of
my
money
i
had
concealed
one
by
one
a
few
notes
of
the
bank
of
england
i
counted
them
over
eight
of
them
forty
pounds
in
all
my
sole
fortune
my
only
means
of
living
true
i
had
besides
these
a
diamond
ring
presented
to
me
under
circumstances
which
made
it
of
no
value
to
me
except
for
its
worth
in
money
and
a
watch
and
chain
given
to
me
years
ago
by
my
father
a
jeweller
had
told
me
that
the
ring
was
worth
sixty
pounds
and
the
watch
and
chain
forty
but
how
difficult
and
dangerous
it
would
be
for
me
to
sell
either
of
them
practically
my
means
were
limited
to
the
eight
of
five
pounds
each
i
kept
out
one
for
the
payment
of
my
passage
and
then
replaced
the
rest
and
carefully
pinned
them
into
the
unstitched
lining
then
i
began
to
wonder
what
my
destination
was
i
knew
nothing
whatever
of
the
channel
islands
except
the
names
which
i
had
learned
at
school
jersey
guernsey
alderney
and
sark
i
repeated
these
over
and
over
again
to
myself
but
which
of
them
we
were
bound
for
or
if
we
were
about
to
call
at
each
one
of
them
i
did
not
know
i
should
have
been
more
at
home
had
i
gone
to
paris
as
the
light
grew
i
became
restless
and
at
last
i
left
my
berth
and
ventured
to
climb
the
the
fresh
air
smote
upon
me
almost
painfully
there
was
no
rain
falling
and
the
wind
had
been
lulling
since
the
dawn
the
sea
itself
was
growing
brighter
and
glittered
here
and
there
in
spots
where
the
sunlight
fell
upon
it
all
the
sailors
looked
beaten
and
worn
out
with
the
night
toil
and
the
few
passengers
who
had
braved
the
passage
and
were
now
well
enough
to
come
on
deck
were
weary
and
there
was
still
no
land
in
sight
for
the
clouds
hung
low
on
the
horizon
and
overhead
the
sky
was
often
overcast
and
gloomy
it
was
so
cold
that
in
spite
of
my
warm
mantle
i
shivered
from
head
to
foot
but
i
could
not
bear
to
go
back
to
the
close
cabin
which
had
been
shut
up
all
night
i
stayed
on
deck
in
the
biting
wind
leaning
over
the
wet
bulwarks
and
gazing
across
the
desolate
sea
till
my
spirits
sank
like
lead
the
reaction
upon
the
violent
strain
on
my
nerves
was
coming
and
i
had
no
power
to
resist
its
influence
i
could
feel
the
tears
rolling
down
my
cheeks
and
falling
on
my
hands
without
caring
to
wipe
them
away
the
more
so
as
there
was
no
one
to
see
them
what
did
my
tears
signify
to
any
one
i
was
cold
and
hungry
and
miserable
how
lonely
i
was
how
poor
with
neither
a
home
nor
a
friend
in
the
world
a
mere
castaway
upon
the
waves
of
this
troublous
life
is
a
brave
sailor
said
a
voice
behind
me
which
i
recognized
as
my
seaman
of
the
night
before
whom
i
had
wellnigh
forgotten
but
the
storm
is
over
now
and
we
shall
be
in
port
only
an
hour
or
two
behind
time
what
port
shall
we
reach
i
asked
not
caring
to
turn
round
lest
he
should
see
my
wet
eyes
and
cheeks
he
answered
then
does
not
know
our
islands
no
i
said
where
is
st
in
guernsey
he
replied
is
going
to
guernsey
or
jersey
jersey
is
about
two
hours
sail
from
guernsey
if
you
were
going
to
land
at
i
might
be
of
some
service
to
you
i
turned
round
then
and
looked
at
him
steadily
his
voice
was
a
very
pleasant
one
full
of
tones
that
went
straight
to
my
heart
and
filled
me
with
confidence
his
face
did
not
give
the
lie
to
it
or
cause
me
any
disappointment
he
was
no
gentleman
that
was
plain
his
face
was
bronzed
and
as
if
he
often
encountered
rough
weather
but
his
eyes
had
a
steadfast
quiet
power
in
them
and
his
mouth
although
it
was
almost
hidden
by
hair
had
a
pleasant
curve
about
it
i
could
not
guess
how
old
he
was
he
looked
a
man
to
me
his
great
rough
hands
which
had
never
worn
gloves
were
stained
and
hard
with
labor
and
he
had
evidently
been
taking
a
share
in
the
toil
of
the
night
for
his
woven
blue
jacket
was
wet
through
and
his
hair
was
damp
and
rough
with
the
wind
and
rain
he
raised
his
cap
as
my
eyes
looked
straight
into
his
and
a
faint
smile
flitted
across
his
grave
face
i
want
i
said
suddenly
to
find
a
place
where
i
can
live
very
cheaply
i
have
not
much
money
and
i
must
make
it
last
a
long
time
i
do
not
mind
how
quiet
the
place
or
how
poor
the
quieter
the
better
for
me
can
you
tell
me
of
such
a
place
you
would
want
a
place
fit
for
a
lady
he
said
in
a
tone
and
with
a
glance
at
my
silk
dress
no
i
answered
eagerly
i
mean
such
a
cottage
as
you
would
live
in
i
would
do
all
my
own
work
for
i
am
very
poor
and
i
do
not
know
yet
how
i
can
get
my
living
i
must
be
very
careful
of
my
money
till
i
find
out
what
i
can
do
what
sort
of
a
place
do
you
and
your
wife
live
in
his
face
was
clouded
a
little
i
thought
and
he
did
not
answer
me
till
after
a
short
silence
my
poor
little
wife
is
dead
he
answered
and
i
do
not
live
in
guernsey
or
jersey
we
live
in
sark
my
mother
and
i
am
a
fisherman
but
i
have
also
a
little
farm
for
with
us
the
land
goes
from
the
father
to
the
eldest
son
and
i
was
the
eldest
it
is
true
we
have
one
room
to
spare
which
might
do
for
but
the
island
is
far
away
and
very
jersey
is
gay
and
so
is
guernsey
but
in
the
winter
sark
is
too
mournful
it
will
be
just
the
place
i
want
i
said
eagerly
it
would
suit
me
exactly
can
you
let
me
go
there
at
once
will
you
take
me
with
you
he
replied
smiling
the
room
must
be
made
ready
for
you
and
i
must
speak
to
my
mother
besides
sark
is
six
miles
from
guernsey
and
the
passage
would
be
too
rough
for
you
if
god
sends
us
fair
weather
i
will
come
back
to
for
you
in
three
days
my
name
is
tardif
you
can
ask
the
people
in
what
sort
of
a
man
tardif
of
the
havre
gosselin
is
i
do
not
want
any
one
to
tell
me
what
sort
of
a
man
you
are
i
said
holding
out
my
hand
red
and
cold
with
the
keen
air
he
took
it
into
his
large
rough
palm
looking
down
upon
me
with
an
air
of
friendly
protection
what
is
your
name
he
inquired
oh
my
name
is
olivia
i
said
then
i
stopped
abruptly
for
there
flashed
across
me
the
necessity
for
concealing
it
tardif
did
not
seem
to
notice
my
embarrassment
there
are
some
olliviers
in
he
said
is
of
the
same
family
but
no
that
is
not
probable
i
have
no
relations
i
answered
not
even
in
england
i
have
very
few
friends
and
they
are
all
far
away
in
australia
i
was
born
there
and
lived
there
till
i
was
seventeen
the
tears
sprang
to
my
eyes
again
and
my
new
friend
saw
them
but
said
nothing
he
moved
off
at
once
to
the
far
end
of
the
dock
to
help
one
of
the
crew
in
some
heavy
piece
of
work
he
did
not
come
hack
until
the
rain
began
to
return
a
fine
drizzling
rain
which
came
in
scuds
across
the
sea
he
said
you
ought
to
go
below
and
i
will
tell
you
when
we
are
in
sight
of
guernsey
i
went
below
inexpressibly
more
satisfied
and
comforted
what
it
was
in
this
man
that
won
my
complete
unquestioning
confidence
i
did
not
know
but
his
very
presence
and
the
sight
of
his
good
trustworthy
face
gave
me
a
sense
of
security
such
as
i
have
never
felt
before
or
since
surely
god
had
sent
him
to
me
in
my
great
extremity
chapter
the
fourth
a
safe
haven
we
were
two
hours
after
time
at
and
then
all
was
hurry
and
confusion
for
goods
and
passengers
had
to
be
landed
and
embarked
for
jersey
tardif
who
was
afraid
of
losing
the
cutter
which
would
convey
him
to
sark
had
only
time
to
give
me
the
address
of
a
person
with
whom
i
could
lodge
until
he
came
to
fetch
me
to
his
island
and
then
he
hastened
away
to
a
distant
part
of
the
quay
i
was
not
sorry
that
he
should
miss
finding
out
that
i
had
no
luggage
of
any
kind
with
me
i
was
busy
enough
during
the
next
three
days
for
i
had
every
thing
to
buy
the
widow
with
whom
i
was
lodging
came
to
the
conclusion
that
i
had
lost
all
my
luggage
and
i
did
not
try
to
remove
the
false
impression
through
her
assistance
i
was
able
to
procure
all
i
required
without
exciting
more
notice
and
curiosity
my
purchases
though
they
were
as
simple
and
cheap
as
i
could
make
them
drew
largely
upon
my
small
store
of
money
and
as
i
saw
it
dwindling
away
while
i
grudged
every
shilling
i
was
obliged
to
part
with
my
spirits
sank
lower
and
lower
i
had
never
known
the
dread
of
being
short
of
money
and
the
new
experience
was
perhaps
the
more
terrible
to
me
there
was
no
chance
of
disposing
of
the
costly
dress
in
which
i
had
journeyed
without
arousing
too
much
attention
and
running
too
great
a
risk
i
stayed
as
much
as
possible
and
as
the
weather
continued
cold
and
gloomy
i
did
not
meet
many
persons
when
i
ventured
out
into
the
narrow
streets
of
the
town
but
on
the
third
day
when
i
looked
out
from
my
window
i
saw
that
the
sky
had
cleared
and
the
sun
was
shining
joyously
it
was
one
of
those
lovely
days
which
come
as
a
lull
sometimes
in
the
midst
of
the
equinoctial
gales
as
if
they
were
weary
of
the
havoc
they
had
made
and
were
resting
with
folded
wings
for
the
first
time
i
saw
the
little
island
of
sark
lying
against
the
eastern
sky
the
whole
length
of
it
was
visible
from
north
to
south
with
the
waves
beating
against
its
headlands
and
a
fringe
of
silvery
foam
girdling
it
the
sky
was
of
a
pale
blue
as
though
the
rains
had
washed
it
as
well
as
the
earth
and
a
few
filmy
clouds
were
still
lingering
about
it
the
sea
beneath
was
a
deeper
blue
with
streaks
almost
like
a
hoar
frost
upon
it
with
here
and
there
tints
of
green
like
that
of
the
sky
at
sunset
a
boat
with
three
white
sails
which
were
reflected
in
the
water
was
tacking
about
to
enter
the
harbor
and
a
second
with
amber
sails
was
a
little
way
behind
but
following
quickly
in
its
wake
i
watched
them
for
a
long
time
was
either
of
them
tardif
boat
that
question
was
answered
in
about
two
hours
time
by
appearance
at
the
house
he
lifted
my
little
box
on
to
his
broad
shoulders
and
marched
away
with
it
trying
vainly
to
reduce
his
long
strides
into
steps
that
would
suit
me
as
i
walked
beside
him
i
felt
overjoyed
that
he
was
come
so
long
as
i
was
in
guernsey
when
every
morning
i
could
see
the
arrival
of
the
packet
that
had
brought
me
i
could
not
shake
off
the
fear
that
it
was
bringing
some
one
in
pursuit
of
me
but
in
sark
that
would
be
all
different
besides
i
felt
instinctively
that
this
man
would
protect
me
and
take
my
part
to
the
very
utmost
should
any
circumstances
arise
that
compelled
me
to
appeal
to
him
and
trust
him
with
my
secret
i
knew
nothing
of
him
but
his
face
was
stamped
with
god
seal
of
trustworthiness
if
ever
a
human
face
was
a
second
man
was
in
the
boat
when
we
reached
it
and
it
looked
well
laden
tardif
made
a
comfortable
seat
for
me
amid
the
packages
and
then
the
sails
were
unfurled
and
we
were
off
quickly
out
of
the
harbor
and
on
the
open
sea
a
low
westerly
wind
was
blowing
and
fell
upon
the
sails
with
a
strong
and
equal
pressure
we
rode
before
it
rapidly
skimming
over
the
low
crested
waves
almost
without
a
motion
never
before
had
i
felt
so
perfectly
secure
upon
the
water
now
i
could
breathe
freely
with
the
sense
of
assured
safety
growing
stronger
every
moment
as
the
coast
of
guernsey
receded
on
the
horizon
and
the
rocky
little
island
grew
nearer
as
we
approached
it
no
was
to
be
seen
no
beach
or
strand
an
coast
of
sharp
and
rugged
crags
confronted
us
which
it
seemed
impossible
to
scale
at
last
we
cast
anchor
at
the
foot
of
a
great
cliff
rising
sheer
out
of
the
sea
where
a
ladder
hung
down
the
face
of
the
rock
for
a
few
feet
a
wilder
or
lonelier
place
i
had
never
seen
nobody
could
pursue
and
surprise
me
here
the
boatman
who
was
with
us
climbed
up
the
ladder
and
kneeling
down
stretched
out
his
hand
to
help
me
while
tardif
stood
waiting
to
hold
me
steadily
on
the
damp
and
slippery
rungs
for
a
moment
i
hesitated
and
looked
round
at
the
crags
and
the
tossing
restless
sea
i
could
carry
you
through
the
water
said
tardif
pointing
to
a
hand
breadth
of
shingle
lying
between
the
rocks
but
you
will
get
wet
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
mount
up
here
i
fastened
both
of
my
hands
tightly
round
one
of
the
upper
rungs
before
lifting
my
feet
from
the
unsteady
prow
of
the
boat
but
the
ladder
once
climbed
the
rest
of
the
ascent
was
easy
i
walked
on
up
a
zigzag
path
cut
in
the
face
of
the
cliff
until
i
gained
the
summit
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
tardif
and
his
comrade
i
could
not
have
fled
to
a
securer
so
long
as
my
money
held
out
i
might
live
as
peacefully
and
safely
as
any
fugitive
had
ever
lived
for
a
little
while
i
sat
looking
out
at
the
wild
and
beautiful
scene
before
me
which
no
words
can
tell
and
no
fancy
picture
to
those
who
have
never
seen
it
the
white
foam
of
the
waves
was
so
near
that
i
could
see
the
rainbow
colors
playing
through
the
bubbles
as
the
sun
shone
on
them
below
the
clear
water
lay
a
girdle
of
sunken
rocks
pointed
as
needles
and
with
edges
as
sharp
as
swords
about
which
the
waves
fretted
ceaselessly
drawing
silvery
lines
about
their
notched
and
dented
ridges
the
cliffs
ran
up
precipitously
from
the
sea
carved
grotesquely
over
their
whole
surface
into
strange
and
fantastic
shapes
while
the
golden
and
gray
lichens
embroidered
them
richly
and
bright
and
stray
tufts
of
grass
lent
them
the
most
vivid
and
gorgeous
hues
beyond
the
channel
against
the
clear
western
sky
lay
the
island
of
guernsey
rising
like
a
purple
mountain
out
of
the
opal
sea
which
lay
like
a
lake
between
us
sparkling
and
changing
every
minute
under
the
light
of
the
afternoon
sun
but
there
was
scarcely
time
for
the
exquisite
beauty
of
this
scene
to
sink
deeply
into
my
heart
just
then
before
long
i
heard
the
tramp
of
tardif
and
his
comrade
following
me
their
heavy
tread
sent
down
the
loose
stones
on
the
path
plunging
into
the
sea
they
were
both
laden
with
part
of
the
boat
cargo
they
stopped
to
rest
for
a
minute
or
two
at
the
spot
where
i
had
sat
down
and
the
other
boatman
began
talking
earnestly
to
tardif
in
his
of
which
i
did
not
understand
a
word
tardif
face
was
very
grave
and
sad
indescribably
so
and
before
he
turned
to
me
and
spoke
i
knew
it
was
some
sorrowful
catastrophe
he
had
to
tell
you
see
how
smooth
it
is
he
said
how
clear
and
beautiful
down
below
us
where
the
waves
are
at
play
like
little
white
children
i
love
them
but
they
are
cruel
and
treacherous
while
i
was
away
there
was
an
accident
down
yonder
just
beyond
these
rocks
our
doctor
and
two
gentlemen
and
a
sailor
went
out
from
our
little
bay
below
and
shortly
after
there
came
on
a
thick
darkness
with
heavy
rain
and
they
were
all
lost
every
one
of
them
poor
renouf
he
was
a
good
friend
of
mine
and
our
doctor
too
if
i
had
been
here
maybe
i
might
have
persuaded
them
not
to
brave
it
it
was
a
sad
story
to
hear
yet
just
then
i
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
it
i
was
too
much
engrossed
in
my
own
difficulties
and
trouble
so
far
as
my
experience
goes
i
believe
the
heart
is
more
open
to
other
people
sorrows
when
it
is
free
from
burdens
of
its
own
i
was
glad
when
tardif
took
up
his
load
again
and
turned
his
back
upon
the
sea
chapter
the
fifth
will
it
do
tardif
walked
on
before
me
to
a
low
thatched
cottage
standing
at
the
back
of
a
small
there
was
no
other
dwelling
in
sight
and
even
the
sea
was
not
visible
from
it
it
was
sheltered
by
the
steep
slope
of
a
hill
rising
behind
it
and
looked
upon
another
slope
covered
with
a
very
deep
and
narrow
ravine
ran
down
from
it
to
the
of
shingle
which
i
had
seen
from
the
boat
a
more
solitary
place
i
could
not
have
imagined
no
sign
of
human
life
or
its
neighborhood
betrayed
itself
overhead
was
a
vast
dome
of
sky
with
a
few
flitting
across
it
and
uttering
their
low
wailing
cry
the
roof
of
sky
and
the
two
round
outlines
of
the
little
hills
and
the
deep
dark
ravine
the
end
of
which
was
unseen
formed
the
whole
of
the
view
before
me
i
felt
chilled
a
little
as
i
followed
tardif
down
into
the
dell
he
glanced
back
with
grave
searching
eyes
scanning
my
face
carefully
i
tried
to
smile
with
a
very
faint
wan
smile
i
suppose
for
the
lightness
had
fled
from
my
spirits
and
my
heart
was
heavy
enough
god
knows
will
it
not
do
he
asked
anxiously
and
with
his
slow
solemn
utterance
it
is
not
a
place
that
will
do
for
a
young
lady
like
you
is
it
i
should
have
counselled
you
to
go
on
to
jersey
where
there
is
more
life
and
gayety
it
is
my
home
but
for
you
it
will
be
nothing
but
a
dull
prison
no
no
i
answered
as
the
recollection
of
the
prison
i
had
fled
from
flashed
across
me
it
is
a
very
pretty
place
and
very
safe
i
shall
like
it
as
much
as
you
do
tardif
the
house
was
a
low
picturesque
building
with
thick
walls
of
stone
and
a
thatched
roof
which
had
two
little
in
it
but
at
the
most
sheltered
end
farthest
from
the
ravine
that
led
down
to
the
sea
there
had
been
built
a
small
square
room
of
as
we
entered
the
tardif
pointed
this
room
out
to
me
as
mine
i
built
it
he
said
softly
for
my
poor
little
wife
i
brought
the
bricks
over
from
guernsey
in
my
own
boat
and
laid
nearly
every
one
of
them
with
my
own
hands
she
died
in
it
please
god
you
will
be
both
happy
and
safe
there
we
stepped
directly
from
the
stone
causeway
of
the
yard
into
the
kitchen
the
only
in
the
house
except
my
own
it
was
exquisitely
clean
with
that
spotless
and
scrupulous
cleanliness
which
appears
impossible
in
houses
where
there
are
carpets
and
curtains
and
papered
walls
an
old
woman
very
little
and
bent
and
dressed
in
an
odd
and
ugly
costume
met
us
at
the
door
dropping
a
courtesy
to
me
and
looking
at
me
with
dim
watery
eyes
i
was
about
to
speak
to
her
when
tardif
bent
down
his
head
and
put
his
mouth
to
her
ear
shouting
to
her
with
a
loud
voice
but
in
their
peculiar
jargon
of
which
i
could
not
make
out
a
single
word
my
poor
mother
is
deaf
he
said
to
me
very
deaf
neither
can
she
speak
english
most
of
the
young
people
in
sark
can
talk
in
english
a
little
but
she
is
old
and
too
deaf
to
learn
she
has
only
once
been
off
the
island
i
looked
at
her
wondering
for
a
moment
what
she
could
have
to
think
of
but
with
an
intelligible
gesture
of
welcome
she
beckoned
me
into
my
own
room
the
aspect
of
it
was
somewhat
dreary
the
walls
were
of
bare
plaster
but
dazzlingly
white
with
one
little
black
of
a
woman
head
hanging
in
a
common
black
frame
over
the
low
open
hearth
on
which
a
fire
of
seaweed
was
smouldering
with
a
quantity
of
gray
ashes
round
the
small
centre
of
smoking
embers
there
was
a
little
round
table
uncovered
but
as
white
as
snow
and
two
chairs
one
of
them
an
and
furnished
with
cushions
a
bedstead
with
curtains
of
blue
and
white
check
occupied
the
larger
portion
of
the
floor
it
was
not
a
luxurious
apartment
and
for
an
instant
i
could
hardly
realize
the
fact
that
it
was
to
be
my
home
for
an
indefinite
period
some
efforts
had
evidently
been
made
to
give
it
a
look
of
welcome
homely
as
it
was
a
pretty
china
tea
cup
and
saucer
with
a
plate
or
two
to
match
were
set
out
on
the
deal
table
and
the
cushioned
had
been
drawn
forward
to
the
hearth
i
sat
down
in
it
and
buried
my
face
in
my
hands
thinking
till
tardif
knocked
at
the
door
and
carried
in
my
trunk
will
it
do
he
asked
will
it
do
it
will
do
very
nicely
tardif
i
answered
but
how
ever
am
i
to
talk
to
your
mother
if
she
does
not
know
english
he
said
as
he
uncorded
my
trunk
you
must
order
me
as
you
would
a
servant
through
the
winter
i
shall
always
be
at
hand
and
you
will
soon
be
used
to
us
and
our
ways
and
we
shall
be
used
to
you
and
your
ways
i
will
do
my
best
for
you
trust
me
i
will
study
to
do
my
best
and
make
you
very
happy
here
i
will
be
ready
to
take
you
away
whenever
you
desire
to
go
look
upon
me
as
your
hired
servant
he
waited
upon
me
all
the
evening
but
with
a
quick
attention
to
my
wants
which
i
had
never
met
with
in
any
hired
servant
it
was
not
unfamiliar
to
me
for
in
my
own
country
i
had
often
been
served
only
by
men
and
especially
during
my
girlhood
when
i
had
lived
far
away
in
the
country
upon
my
father
i
knew
it
was
tardif
who
fried
the
fish
which
came
in
with
my
tea
and
when
the
night
closed
in
it
was
he
who
trimmed
the
and
brought
it
in
and
drew
the
check
curtains
across
the
low
casement
as
if
there
were
prying
eyes
to
see
me
on
the
opposite
bank
then
a
deep
deep
stillness
crept
over
the
solitary
place
a
stillness
strangely
deeper
than
that
even
of
the
daytime
the
wail
of
the
died
away
and
the
few
busy
cries
of
the
ceased
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
silence
was
a
muffled
hollow
boom
which
came
up
the
ravine
from
the
sea
before
nine
tardif
and
his
mother
had
gone
to
their
rooms
in
the
thatch
and
i
lay
wearied
but
sleepless
in
my
bed
listening
to
these
dull
faint
ceaseless
murmurs
as
a
child
listens
to
the
sound
of
the
sea
in
a
shell
was
it
possible
that
it
was
i
myself
the
olivia
who
had
been
so
loved
and
cherished
in
her
girlhood
and
so
hated
and
tortured
in
later
years
who
was
come
to
live
under
a
fisherman
roof
in
an
island
the
name
of
which
i
barely
knew
four
days
ago
i
fell
asleep
at
last
yet
i
awoke
early
but
not
so
early
that
the
other
inmates
of
the
cottage
were
not
up
and
about
their
day
work
it
was
my
wish
to
wait
upon
myself
and
so
diminish
the
cost
of
living
with
these
secluded
people
but
i
found
it
was
not
to
be
so
tardif
waited
upon
me
assiduously
as
well
as
his
deaf
mother
the
old
woman
would
not
suffer
me
to
do
any
work
in
my
own
room
but
put
me
quietly
upon
one
side
when
i
began
to
make
my
bed
fortunately
i
had
plenty
of
sewing
to
employ
myself
in
for
i
had
taken
care
not
to
waste
my
money
by
buying
clothes
the
equinoctial
gales
came
on
again
fiercely
the
day
after
i
had
reached
sark
and
i
stitched
away
from
morning
till
night
trying
to
fix
my
thoughts
upon
my
mechanical
work
when
the
first
week
was
over
tardif
mother
came
to
me
at
a
time
when
her
son
was
away
with
a
purse
in
her
fingers
and
by
very
plain
signs
made
me
understand
that
it
was
time
i
paid
the
first
instalment
of
my
debt
to
her
for
board
and
lodgings
i
was
anxious
about
my
money
no
agreement
had
been
made
between
us
as
to
what
i
was
to
pay
i
laid
a
sovereign
down
upon
the
table
and
the
old
woman
looked
at
it
carefully
and
with
a
pleased
expression
but
she
put
it
in
her
purse
and
walked
away
with
it
giving
me
no
change
not
that
i
altogether
expected
any
change
they
provided
me
with
every
thing
i
needed
and
waited
upon
me
with
very
careful
service
yet
now
i
could
calculate
exactly
how
long
i
should
be
safe
in
this
refuge
and
the
calculation
gave
me
great
uneasiness
in
a
few
months
i
should
find
myself
still
in
need
of
refuge
but
without
the
means
of
paying
for
it
what
would
become
of
me
then
very
slowly
the
winter
wore
on
how
shall
i
describe
the
peaceful
monotony
the
dull
lonely
safety
of
those
dark
days
and
long
nights
i
had
been
violently
tossed
from
a
life
of
extreme
trouble
and
peril
into
a
profound
unbroken
sleepy
security
at
first
the
sudden
change
stupefied
me
but
after
a
while
there
came
over
me
an
uneasy
restlessness
a
longing
to
get
away
from
the
silence
and
solitude
even
if
it
were
into
insecurity
and
danger
i
began
to
wonder
how
the
world
beyond
the
little
island
was
going
on
no
news
reached
us
from
without
sometimes
for
weeks
together
it
was
impossible
for
an
open
boat
to
cross
over
to
guernsey
even
when
a
cutter
accomplished
its
voyage
out
and
in
no
letters
could
arrive
for
me
the
season
was
so
far
advanced
when
i
went
to
sark
that
those
visitors
who
had
been
spending
a
portion
of
the
summer
there
had
already
taken
their
departure
leaving
the
islanders
to
themselves
they
were
sufficient
for
themselves
they
and
their
own
affairs
formed
the
world
tardif
would
bring
home
almost
daily
little
scraps
of
news
about
the
other
families
scattered
about
sark
but
of
the
greater
affairs
of
life
in
other
countries
he
could
tell
me
nothing
yet
why
should
i
call
these
greater
affairs
each
to
himself
is
the
centre
of
the
world
it
was
a
more
important
thing
to
me
that
i
was
safe
than
that
the
freedom
of
england
itself
should
be
secure
chapter
the
sixth
too
much
alone
yet
looking
back
upon
that
time
now
it
is
past
and
has
rounded
itself
into
that
perfect
star
i
saw
not
when
i
dwelt
therein
it
would
be
untrue
to
represent
myself
as
in
any
way
unhappy
at
times
i
wished
earnestly
that
i
had
been
born
among
these
people
and
could
live
forever
among
them
by
degrees
i
discovered
that
tardif
led
a
somewhat
solitary
life
himself
even
in
this
solitary
island
with
its
scanty
population
there
was
an
ugly
church
standing
in
as
central
and
prominent
a
situation
as
possible
but
tardif
and
his
mother
did
not
frequent
it
they
belonged
to
a
little
knot
of
dissenters
who
met
for
worship
in
a
small
room
when
tardif
generally
took
the
lead
for
this
reason
a
sort
of
coldness
existed
between
him
and
the
larger
portion
of
his
but
there
was
a
second
and
more
important
cause
for
a
slight
estrangement
he
had
married
an
englishwoman
many
years
ago
much
to
the
astonishment
and
disappointment
of
his
neighbors
and
since
her
death
he
had
held
himself
aloof
from
all
the
good
women
who
would
have
been
glad
enough
to
undertake
the
task
of
consoling
him
for
her
loss
tardif
therefore
was
left
very
much
to
himself
in
his
isolated
cottage
and
his
deafness
caused
her
also
to
be
no
very
great
favorite
with
any
of
the
gossips
of
the
island
it
was
so
difficult
to
make
her
understand
any
thing
that
could
not
be
expressed
by
signs
that
no
one
except
her
son
attempted
to
tell
her
the
small
topics
of
the
day
all
this
told
upon
me
and
my
standing
among
them
at
first
i
met
a
few
curious
glances
as
i
roamed
about
the
island
but
my
dress
was
as
poor
and
plain
as
any
of
theirs
and
i
suppose
there
was
nothing
in
my
appearance
setting
aside
my
dress
which
could
attract
them
i
learned
afterward
that
tardif
had
told
those
who
asked
him
that
my
name
was
ollivier
and
they
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
i
belonged
to
a
family
of
that
name
in
guernsey
this
shielded
me
from
the
curiosity
that
might
otherwise
have
been
troublesome
and
dangerous
i
was
nobody
but
a
poor
young
woman
from
guernsey
who
was
lodging
in
the
spare
room
of
cottage
i
set
myself
to
grow
used
to
their
mode
of
life
and
if
possible
to
become
so
useful
to
them
that
when
my
money
was
all
spent
they
might
be
willing
to
keep
me
with
them
for
i
shrank
from
the
thought
of
the
time
when
i
must
be
thrust
out
of
this
nest
lonely
and
silent
as
it
was
as
the
long
dismal
nights
of
winter
set
in
with
the
wind
sweeping
across
the
island
for
several
days
together
with
a
dreary
monotonous
moan
which
never
ceased
i
generally
sat
by
their
fire
for
i
had
nobody
but
tardif
to
talk
to
and
now
and
then
there
arose
an
urgent
need
within
me
to
listen
to
some
friendly
voice
and
to
hear
my
own
speaking
in
reply
there
were
only
two
books
in
the
house
the
bible
and
the
pilgrim
progress
both
of
them
in
french
and
i
had
not
learned
french
beyond
the
few
phrases
necessary
for
travelling
but
tardif
began
to
teach
me
that
and
also
to
mend
which
i
persevered
in
though
the
twine
cut
my
fingers
could
i
by
any
means
make
myself
useful
to
them
as
the
spring
came
on
half
my
dullness
vanished
sark
was
more
beautiful
in
its
cliff
scenery
than
any
thing
i
had
ever
seen
or
could
have
imagined
why
can
not
i
describe
it
to
you
i
have
but
to
close
my
eyes
and
my
memory
paints
it
for
me
in
my
brain
with
its
innumerable
islets
engirdling
it
as
if
to
ward
off
its
busy
indefatigable
enemy
the
sea
the
long
sunken
reefs
lying
below
the
water
at
high
tide
but
at
the
ebb
stretching
like
fortifications
about
it
as
if
to
make
of
it
a
sure
stronghold
in
the
sea
the
strange
architecture
and
carving
of
the
rocks
with
faces
and
crowned
heads
but
half
obliterated
upon
them
the
lofty
arches
with
columns
of
fretwork
bearing
them
the
pinnacles
and
sharp
spires
the
fallen
masses
heaped
against
the
base
of
the
cliffs
covered
with
seaweed
and
worn
out
of
all
form
yet
looking
like
the
fragments
of
some
great
temple
with
its
treasures
of
sculpture
and
about
them
all
the
clear
lucid
water
swelling
and
tossing
throwing
over
them
sparkling
sheets
of
foam
and
the
brilliant
tone
of
the
golden
and
saffron
lichens
and
the
delicate
tint
of
the
gray
and
silvery
ones
stealing
about
the
bosses
and
angles
and
curves
of
the
rocks
as
if
the
rain
and
the
wind
and
the
frost
had
spent
their
whole
power
there
to
produce
artistic
effects
i
say
my
memory
paints
it
again
for
me
but
it
is
only
a
memory
a
shadow
that
my
mind
sees
and
how
can
i
describe
to
you
a
shadow
when
words
are
but
phantoms
themselves
how
can
i
use
them
to
set
forth
a
phantom
whenever
the
grandeur
of
the
cliffs
had
wearied
me
as
one
grows
weary
sometimes
of
too
long
and
too
close
a
study
of
what
is
great
there
was
a
little
enclosed
quiet
graveyard
that
lay
in
the
very
lap
of
the
island
where
i
could
go
for
rest
it
was
a
small
patch
of
ground
a
god
acre
shut
in
on
every
side
by
high
which
hid
every
view
from
sight
except
that
of
the
heavens
brooding
over
it
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
the
long
mossy
mounds
above
the
dead
and
the
great
warm
sunny
dome
rising
above
them
even
the
church
was
not
there
for
it
was
built
in
another
spot
and
had
a
few
graves
of
its
own
scattered
about
it
i
was
sitting
there
one
evening
in
the
early
spring
after
the
sun
had
dipped
below
the
line
of
the
high
though
it
was
still
shining
in
level
rays
through
it
no
sound
had
disturbed
the
deep
silence
for
a
long
time
except
the
twittering
of
birds
among
the
branches
for
up
here
even
the
sea
could
not
be
heard
when
it
was
calm
i
suppose
my
face
was
sad
as
most
human
faces
are
apt
to
be
when
the
spirit
is
busy
in
its
citadel
and
has
left
the
outworks
of
the
eyes
and
mouth
to
themselves
so
i
was
sitting
quiet
with
my
hands
clasped
about
my
knees
and
my
face
bent
down
when
a
grave
low
voice
at
my
side
startled
me
back
to
consciousness
tardif
was
standing
beside
me
and
looking
down
upon
me
with
a
world
of
watchful
anxiety
in
his
deep
eyes
you
are
sad
he
said
too
sad
for
one
so
young
as
you
are
oh
everybody
is
sad
tardif
i
answered
there
is
a
great
deal
of
trouble
for
every
one
in
this
world
you
are
often
very
sad
indeed
ah
but
i
have
a
cause
he
said
does
not
know
that
she
is
sitting
on
the
grave
of
my
little
wife
he
knelt
down
beside
it
as
he
spoke
and
laid
his
hand
gently
on
the
green
turf
i
would
have
risen
but
he
would
not
let
me
no
he
said
sit
still
yes
you
would
have
loved
her
poor
little
soul
she
was
an
englishwoman
like
you
only
not
a
lady
a
pretty
little
english
girl
so
little
i
could
carry
her
like
a
baby
none
of
my
people
took
to
her
and
she
was
very
lonely
like
you
again
and
she
pined
and
faded
away
just
quietly
never
saying
one
word
against
them
no
no
i
like
to
see
you
here
this
is
a
favorite
place
with
you
and
it
gives
me
pleasure
i
ask
myself
a
hundred
times
a
day
there
any
thing
i
can
do
to
make
my
young
lady
happy
tell
me
what
i
can
do
more
than
i
have
done
there
is
nothing
tardif
i
answered
nothing
whatever
if
you
see
me
sad
sometimes
take
no
notice
of
it
for
you
can
do
no
more
for
me
than
you
are
doing
as
it
is
you
are
almost
the
only
friend
perhaps
the
only
true
friend
i
have
in
the
world
may
god
be
true
to
me
only
as
i
am
true
to
you
he
said
solemnly
while
his
dark
skin
flushed
and
his
eyes
kindled
i
looked
at
him
closely
a
more
honest
face
one
could
never
see
and
his
keen
blue
eyes
met
my
gaze
steadfastly
as
i
was
just
then
i
could
not
help
but
smile
and
all
his
face
brightened
as
the
sea
at
its
dullest
brightens
suddenly
tinder
a
stray
gleam
of
sunshine
without
another
word
we
both
rose
to
our
feet
and
stood
side
by
side
for
a
minute
looking
down
on
the
little
grave
beneath
us
i
would
have
gladly
changed
places
then
with
the
lonely
english
girl
who
had
pined
away
in
this
remote
island
after
that
short
silent
pause
we
went
slowly
homeward
along
the
quiet
almost
solitary
lanes
twice
we
met
a
fisherman
with
his
creel
and
nets
across
his
shoulders
who
bade
us
but
no
one
else
crossed
our
path
it
was
a
profound
monotony
a
seclusion
i
should
not
have
had
courage
to
face
wittingly
but
i
had
been
led
into
it
and
i
dared
not
quit
it
how
long
was
it
to
last
chapter
the
seventh
a
false
step
a
day
came
after
the
winter
storms
early
in
march
with
all
the
strength
and
sweetness
of
spring
in
it
though
there
was
sharpness
enough
in
the
air
to
make
my
veins
tingle
the
sun
was
shining
with
so
much
heat
in
it
that
i
might
be
all
day
under
the
shelter
of
the
rocks
in
the
warm
southern
nooks
where
the
daisies
were
growing
the
birds
sang
more
blithely
than
they
had
ever
done
before
a
lark
overhead
flinging
down
his
triumphant
notes
a
thrush
whistling
clearly
in
a
hanging
over
the
cliff
and
the
cry
of
the
gulls
flitting
about
the
rocks
i
could
hear
them
all
at
the
same
moment
with
the
deep
quiet
tone
of
the
sea
sounding
below
their
gay
music
tardif
was
going
out
to
fish
and
i
had
helped
him
to
pack
his
basket
from
my
niche
in
the
rocks
i
could
see
him
getting
out
of
the
harbor
and
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
me
and
stood
up
in
his
boat
bareheaded
bidding
me
i
began
to
sing
before
he
was
quite
out
of
hearing
for
he
paused
upon
his
oars
listening
and
had
given
me
a
joyous
shout
and
waved
his
hat
round
his
head
when
he
was
sure
it
was
i
who
was
singing
nothing
could
be
plainer
than
that
he
had
gone
away
more
glad
at
heart
than
he
had
been
all
the
winter
simply
because
he
believed
that
i
was
growing
i
could
not
help
laughing
yet
being
touched
and
softened
at
the
thought
of
his
pleasure
what
a
good
fellow
he
was
i
had
proved
him
by
this
time
and
knew
him
to
be
one
of
the
truest
bravest
most
unselfish
men
on
god
earth
how
good
a
thing
it
was
that
i
had
met
with
him
that
wild
night
last
october
when
i
had
fled
like
one
fleeing
from
a
bitter
slavery
for
a
few
minutes
my
thoughts
hovered
about
that
old
miserable
evil
time
but
i
did
not
care
to
ponder
over
past
troubles
it
was
easy
to
forget
them
and
i
would
forget
them
i
plucked
the
daisies
and
listened
almost
drowsily
to
the
birds
and
the
sea
and
felt
all
through
me
the
delicious
light
and
heat
of
the
sun
now
and
then
i
lifted
up
my
eyes
to
watch
tardif
tacking
about
on
the
water
there
were
several
boats
out
but
i
kept
his
in
sight
by
the
help
of
a
patch
upon
one
of
the
sails
i
wished
lazily
for
a
book
but
i
should
not
have
read
it
if
i
had
had
one
i
was
taking
into
my
heart
the
loveliness
of
the
spring
day
by
twelve
i
knew
my
dinner
would
be
ready
and
i
had
been
out
in
the
fresh
air
long
enough
to
be
quite
ready
for
it
old
tardif
would
be
looking
out
for
me
impatiently
that
she
might
get
the
meal
over
and
the
things
cleared
away
and
order
restored
in
her
dwelling
so
i
quitted
my
warm
nook
with
a
feeling
of
regret
though
i
knew
i
could
return
to
it
in
an
hour
but
one
can
never
return
to
any
thing
that
is
once
left
when
we
look
for
it
again
even
though
the
place
may
remain
something
has
vanished
from
it
which
can
never
come
back
i
never
returned
to
my
upon
the
cliffs
of
sark
a
little
crumbling
path
led
round
the
rock
and
along
the
edge
of
the
ravine
i
chose
it
because
from
it
i
could
see
all
the
fantastic
shore
bending
in
a
semicircle
toward
the
isle
of
breckhou
with
tiny
untrodden
bays
covered
at
this
hour
with
only
glittering
ripples
and
with
all
the
soft
and
tender
shadows
of
the
headlands
falling
across
them
i
had
but
to
look
straight
below
me
and
i
could
see
long
tresses
of
glossy
seaweed
floating
under
the
surface
of
the
sea
both
my
head
and
my
footing
were
steady
for
i
had
grown
accustomed
to
giddy
heights
and
venturesome
climbing
i
walked
on
slowly
casting
many
a
reluctant
glance
behind
me
at
the
calm
waters
with
the
boats
gliding
to
and
fro
among
the
islets
i
was
just
giving
my
last
look
to
them
when
the
loose
stones
on
the
crumbling
path
gave
way
under
my
tread
and
before
i
could
recover
my
foothold
i
found
myself
slipping
down
the
almost
perpendicular
face
of
the
cliff
and
vainly
clutching
at
every
bramble
and
tuft
of
grass
growing
in
its
clefts
chapter
the
eighth
an
island
without
a
doctor
i
had
not
time
to
feel
any
fear
for
almost
before
i
could
realize
the
fact
that
i
was
falling
i
touched
the
ground
the
point
from
which
i
had
slipped
was
above
the
reach
of
the
water
but
i
fell
upon
the
shingly
beach
so
heavily
that
i
was
hardly
conscious
for
a
few
minutes
when
i
came
to
my
senses
again
i
lay
still
for
a
little
while
trying
to
make
out
where
i
was
and
how
i
came
there
i
was
stunned
and
bewildered
underneath
me
were
the
smooth
round
pebbles
which
lie
above
the
line
of
the
tide
on
a
shore
covered
with
shingles
above
me
rose
a
dark
frowning
rock
the
chilly
shadow
of
which
lay
across
me
without
lifting
my
head
i
could
see
the
water
on
a
level
with
me
but
it
did
not
look
on
a
level
its
bright
crested
waves
seemed
swelling
upward
to
the
sky
ready
to
pour
over
me
and
bury
me
beneath
them
i
was
very
faint
and
sick
and
giddy
the
ground
felt
as
if
it
were
about
to
sink
under
me
my
eyelids
closed
languidly
when
i
did
not
keep
them
open
by
an
effort
and
my
head
ached
and
my
brain
swam
with
confused
fancies
after
some
time
and
with
some
difficulty
i
comprehended
what
had
happened
to
me
and
recollected
that
it
was
already
past
and
tardif
would
be
waiting
for
me
i
attempted
to
stand
up
but
an
acute
pain
in
my
foot
compelled
me
to
desist
i
tried
to
turn
myself
upon
the
pebbles
and
my
left
arm
refused
to
help
me
i
could
not
check
a
sharp
cry
of
suffering
as
my
left
hand
fell
back
upon
the
stones
on
which
i
was
lying
my
fall
had
cost
me
something
more
than
a
few
minutes
insensibility
and
an
aching
head
i
had
no
more
power
to
move
than
one
who
is
bound
hand
and
foot
after
a
few
vain
efforts
i
lay
quite
still
again
trying
to
deliberate
as
well
as
i
could
for
the
pain
which
racked
me
i
reckoned
up
after
many
attempts
in
which
first
my
memory
failed
me
and
then
my
faculty
of
calculation
what
the
time
of
the
high
tide
would
be
and
how
soon
tardif
would
come
home
as
nearly
as
i
could
make
out
it
would
be
high
water
in
about
two
hours
tardif
had
set
off
at
low
water
as
his
boat
had
been
anchored
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
where
the
ladder
hung
but
before
starting
he
had
said
something
about
returning
at
high
tide
and
running
up
his
boat
on
the
beach
of
our
little
bay
if
he
did
that
he
must
pass
close
by
me
it
was
saturday
morning
and
he
was
not
in
the
habit
of
staying
out
late
on
saturdays
that
he
might
prepare
for
the
services
of
the
next
day
i
might
count
then
upon
the
prospect
of
him
running
the
boat
into
the
bay
and
finding
me
there
in
about
two
time
it
took
me
a
very
long
time
to
make
out
all
this
for
every
now
and
then
my
brain
seemed
to
lose
its
power
for
a
while
and
every
thing
whirled
about
me
especially
there
was
that
awful
sensation
of
sinking
down
down
through
the
pebbles
into
some
chasm
that
was
bottomless
i
had
never
either
felt
pain
or
fainted
before
and
all
this
alarmed
me
presently
i
began
to
listen
to
the
rustle
of
the
pebbles
as
the
rising
tide
flowed
over
them
and
fell
back
again
leaving
them
all
ajar
and
grating
against
one
another
strange
gurgling
jangling
sound
that
seemed
to
have
some
meaning
it
was
very
cold
and
a
creeping
moisture
was
oozing
up
from
the
water
a
vague
wonder
took
hold
of
me
as
to
whether
i
was
really
above
the
line
of
the
tide
for
now
the
march
tides
were
come
i
did
not
know
how
high
their
flood
was
but
i
thought
of
it
without
any
active
feeling
of
terror
or
pain
i
was
numbed
in
body
and
mind
the
ceaseless
chime
of
the
waves
and
the
regularity
of
the
rustling
play
of
the
pebbles
seemed
to
lull
and
soothe
me
almost
in
spite
of
myself
cold
i
was
and
in
sharp
pain
but
my
mind
had
not
energy
enough
either
for
fear
or
effort
what
appeared
to
me
most
terrible
was
the
sensation
coming
back
time
after
time
of
sinking
sinking
into
the
fancied
chasm
beneath
me
i
remember
also
watching
a
spray
of
ivy
far
above
my
head
swaying
and
waving
about
in
the
wind
and
a
little
bird
darting
here
and
there
with
a
brisk
flutter
of
its
tiny
wings
and
a
chirping
note
of
satisfaction
and
the
cloud
drifting
in
soft
small
cloudlets
across
the
sky
these
things
i
saw
not
as
if
they
were
real
but
rather
as
if
they
were
memories
of
things
that
had
passed
before
my
eyes
many
years
before
at
last
whether
years
or
hours
only
had
gone
by
i
could
not
then
have
told
you
i
heard
the
regular
and
careful
beat
of
oars
upon
the
water
and
presently
the
grating
of
a
boat
keel
upon
the
shingle
with
the
rattle
of
a
chain
cast
out
with
the
grapnel
i
could
not
turn
round
or
raise
my
head
but
i
was
sure
it
was
tardif
and
that
he
did
not
yet
see
me
for
he
was
whistling
softly
to
himself
i
had
never
heard
him
whistle
before
tardif
i
cried
attempting
to
shout
but
my
voice
sounded
very
weak
in
my
own
ears
and
the
other
sounds
about
me
seemed
very
loud
he
went
on
with
his
unlading
half
whistling
and
half
humming
his
tune
as
he
landed
the
nets
and
creel
on
the
beach
tardif
i
called
again
summoning
all
my
strength
and
raising
my
head
an
inch
or
two
from
the
hard
pebbles
which
had
been
its
he
paused
then
and
stood
quite
still
listening
i
knew
it
though
i
could
not
see
him
i
ran
the
fingers
of
my
right
hand
through
the
loose
pebbles
about
me
and
his
ear
caught
the
slight
noise
in
a
moment
i
heard
his
strong
feet
coming
across
them
toward
me
mon
dieu
he
exclaimed
what
has
happened
to
you
i
tried
to
smile
as
his
honest
brown
face
bent
over
me
full
of
alarm
it
was
so
great
a
relief
to
see
a
face
like
his
after
that
long
weary
agony
for
it
had
been
agony
to
me
who
did
not
know
what
bodily
pain
was
like
but
in
trying
to
smile
i
felt
my
lips
drawn
and
my
eyes
blinded
with
tears
i
fallen
down
the
cliff
i
said
feebly
and
i
am
hurt
mon
dieu
he
cried
again
the
strong
man
shook
and
his
hand
trembled
as
he
stooped
down
and
laid
it
under
my
head
to
lift
it
up
a
little
his
agitation
touched
me
to
the
heart
even
then
and
i
did
my
best
to
speak
more
calmly
tardif
i
whispered
it
is
not
very
much
and
i
might
have
been
killed
i
think
my
foot
is
hurt
and
i
am
quite
sure
my
arm
is
broken
speaking
made
me
feel
giddy
and
faint
again
so
i
said
no
more
he
lifted
me
in
his
arms
as
easily
and
tenderly
as
a
mother
lifts
up
her
child
and
carried
me
gently
taking
slow
and
measured
strides
up
the
steep
slope
which
led
homeward
i
closed
my
eyes
glad
to
leave
myself
wholly
in
his
charge
and
to
have
nothing
further
to
dread
yet
moaning
a
little
involuntarily
whenever
a
fresh
pang
of
pain
shot
through
me
then
he
would
cry
again
mon
dieu
in
a
beseeching
tone
and
pause
for
an
instant
as
if
to
give
me
rest
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
we
reached
the
gate
and
he
shouted
with
a
tremendous
voice
to
his
mother
to
come
and
open
it
fortunately
she
was
in
sight
and
came
toward
us
quickly
he
carried
me
into
the
house
and
laid
me
down
on
the
de
a
wooden
frame
forming
a
sort
of
couch
and
filled
with
dried
fern
which
forms
the
principal
piece
of
furniture
in
every
kitchen
in
the
channel
islands
then
he
cut
away
the
boot
from
my
swollen
ankle
with
a
steady
but
careful
touch
speaking
now
and
then
a
word
of
encouragement
as
if
i
were
a
child
whom
he
was
tending
his
mother
stood
by
looking
on
helplessly
and
in
bewilderment
for
he
had
not
had
time
to
explain
my
accident
to
her
but
for
my
arm
which
hung
helplessly
at
my
side
and
gave
me
excruciating
pain
when
he
touched
it
it
was
quite
evident
he
could
do
nothing
is
there
nobody
who
could
set
it
i
asked
striving
very
hard
to
keep
calm
we
have
no
doctor
in
sark
now
he
answered
there
is
no
one
but
mother
renouf
i
will
fetch
her
but
when
she
came
she
declared
herself
unable
to
set
a
broken
limb
they
all
three
held
a
consultation
over
it
in
their
own
dialect
but
i
saw
by
the
solemn
shaking
of
their
heads
and
tardif
troubled
expression
that
it
was
entirely
beyond
her
skill
to
set
it
right
she
would
undertake
my
sprained
ankle
for
she
was
famous
for
the
cure
of
sprains
and
bruises
but
my
arm
was
past
her
the
pain
i
was
enduring
bathed
my
face
with
perspiration
but
very
little
could
be
done
to
alleviate
it
tardif
expression
grew
more
and
more
distressed
knows
he
said
stooping
down
to
speak
the
more
softly
to
me
there
is
no
doctor
nearer
than
guernsey
and
the
night
is
not
far
off
what
are
we
to
do
never
mind
tardif
i
answered
resolving
to
be
brave
let
the
women
help
me
into
bed
and
perhaps
i
shall
be
able
to
sleep
we
must
wait
till
morning
it
was
more
easily
said
than
done
the
two
old
women
did
their
best
but
their
touch
was
clumsy
and
their
help
slight
compared
to
tardif
i
was
thoroughly
worn
out
before
i
was
in
bed
but
it
was
a
great
deal
to
find
myself
there
safe
and
warm
instead
of
on
the
cold
hard
pebbles
on
the
beach
mother
renouf
put
my
arm
to
rest
upon
a
pillow
and
bathed
and
fomented
my
ankle
till
it
felt
much
easier
never
never
shall
i
forget
that
night
i
could
not
sleep
but
i
suppose
my
mind
wandered
a
little
hundreds
of
times
i
felt
myself
down
on
the
shore
lying
helplessly
while
great
green
waves
curled
themselves
over
and
fell
just
within
reach
of
me
ready
to
swallow
me
up
yet
always
missing
me
then
i
was
back
again
in
my
own
home
in
adelaide
on
my
father
and
he
was
still
alive
and
with
no
thought
but
how
to
make
every
thing
bright
and
gladsome
for
me
and
hundreds
of
times
i
saw
the
woman
who
was
afterward
to
be
my
stealing
up
to
the
door
and
trying
to
get
in
to
him
and
me
sometimes
i
caught
myself
sobbing
aloud
and
then
tardif
voice
whispering
at
the
door
to
ask
how
was
brought
me
back
to
consciousness
now
and
then
i
looked
round
fancying
i
heard
my
mother
voice
speaking
to
me
and
i
saw
only
the
wrinkled
yellow
face
of
his
mother
nodding
drowsily
in
her
seat
by
the
fire
twice
tardif
brought
me
a
cup
of
tea
freshly
made
i
could
not
distinctly
made
out
who
he
was
or
where
i
was
but
i
tried
to
speak
loudly
enough
for
him
to
hear
me
thank
him
i
was
very
thankful
when
the
first
gleam
of
daylight
shone
into
my
room
it
seemed
to
bring
clearness
to
my
brain
said
tardif
coming
to
my
side
very
early
in
his
fisherman
dress
i
am
going
to
fetch
a
doctor
but
it
is
sunday
i
answered
faintly
i
knew
that
no
boatman
put
out
to
sea
willingly
on
a
sunday
from
sark
and
the
last
fatal
accident
being
on
a
sunday
had
deepened
their
reluctance
it
will
be
right
he
answered
with
glowing
eyes
i
have
no
fear
do
not
be
long
away
tardif
i
said
sobbing
not
one
moment
longer
than
i
can
help
he
replied
part
the
second
chapter
the
first
martin
dobrée
my
name
is
martin
dobrée
martin
or
doctor
martin
i
was
called
throughout
guernsey
it
will
be
necessary
to
state
a
few
particulars
about
my
family
and
position
before
i
proceed
with
my
part
of
this
narrative
my
father
was
dobrée
he
belonged
to
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
the
island
a
family
of
distinguished
but
our
branch
of
it
had
been
growing
poorer
instead
of
richer
during
the
last
three
or
four
generations
we
had
been
gravitating
steadily
downward
my
father
lived
ostensibly
by
his
profession
but
actually
upon
the
income
of
my
cousin
julia
dobrée
who
had
been
his
ward
from
her
childhood
the
house
we
dwelt
in
a
pleasant
one
in
the
grange
belonged
to
julia
and
fully
half
of
the
year
household
expenses
were
defrayed
by
her
our
practice
which
he
and
i
shared
between
us
was
not
a
large
one
though
for
its
extent
it
was
lucrative
enough
but
there
always
is
an
immense
number
of
medical
men
in
guernsey
in
proportion
to
its
population
and
the
island
is
healthy
there
was
small
chance
for
any
of
us
to
make
a
fortune
then
how
was
it
that
i
a
young
man
still
under
thirty
was
wasting
my
time
and
skill
and
professional
training
by
remaining
there
a
sort
of
half
pensioner
on
my
cousin
bounty
the
thickest
rope
that
holds
a
vessel
weighing
scores
of
tons
safely
to
the
is
made
up
of
strands
so
slight
that
almost
a
breath
will
break
them
first
then
and
the
strength
of
of
the
strands
lay
there
was
my
mother
i
could
never
remember
the
time
when
she
had
not
been
delicate
and
ailing
even
when
i
was
a
rough
at
elizabeth
college
it
was
that
infirmity
of
the
body
which
occasionally
betrays
the
wounds
of
a
soul
i
did
not
comprehend
it
while
i
was
a
boy
then
it
was
headache
only
as
i
grew
older
i
discovered
that
it
was
heartache
the
gnawing
of
a
perpetual
disappointment
worse
than
a
sudden
and
violent
calamity
had
slowly
eaten
away
the
very
foundation
of
healthy
life
no
hand
could
administer
any
medicine
for
this
disease
except
mine
and
as
soon
as
i
was
sure
of
that
i
felt
what
my
first
duty
was
i
knew
where
the
blame
of
this
lay
if
any
blame
there
were
i
had
found
it
out
years
ago
by
my
mother
silence
her
white
cheeks
and
her
feeble
tone
of
health
my
father
was
never
openly
unkind
or
careless
but
there
was
always
visible
in
his
manner
a
weariness
of
her
an
utter
disregard
for
her
feelings
he
continued
to
like
young
and
pretty
women
just
as
he
had
liked
her
because
she
was
young
and
pretty
he
remained
at
the
very
point
he
was
at
when
they
began
their
married
life
there
was
nothing
patently
criminal
in
it
god
forbid
nothing
to
create
an
open
and
a
grave
scandal
on
our
little
island
but
it
told
upon
my
mother
it
was
the
one
drop
of
water
falling
day
by
day
a
continual
dropping
in
a
very
rainy
day
and
a
contentious
woman
are
alike
says
the
book
of
proverbs
my
father
small
infidelities
were
much
the
same
to
my
mother
she
was
thrown
altogether
upon
me
for
sympathy
and
support
and
love
when
i
first
fathomed
this
mystery
my
heart
rose
in
very
undutiful
bitterness
against
dobrée
but
i
found
that
it
resulted
less
from
a
want
of
fidelity
to
her
than
from
a
radical
infirmity
in
his
temperament
it
was
almost
as
impossible
for
him
to
avoid
or
conceal
his
preference
for
younger
and
more
attractive
women
as
for
my
mother
to
conquer
the
fretting
vexation
this
preference
caused
to
her
next
to
my
mother
came
julia
my
cousin
five
years
older
than
i
who
had
coldly
looked
down
upon
me
and
snubbed
me
like
a
sister
as
a
boy
watched
my
progress
through
elizabeth
college
and
through
hospital
and
perceived
at
last
that
i
was
a
young
man
whom
it
was
no
disgrace
to
call
cousin
to
crown
all
she
fell
in
love
with
me
so
at
least
my
mother
told
me
taking
me
into
her
confidence
and
speaking
with
a
depth
of
pleading
in
her
sunken
eyes
which
were
worn
with
much
weeping
poor
mother
i
knew
very
well
what
unspoken
wish
was
in
her
heart
julia
had
grown
up
under
her
care
as
i
had
done
and
she
stood
second
to
me
in
her
affection
it
is
not
difficult
to
love
any
woman
who
has
a
moderate
share
of
attractions
at
least
i
did
not
find
it
so
then
i
was
really
fond
of
julia
too
very
fond
i
knew
her
as
intimately
as
any
brother
knows
his
sister
she
had
kept
up
a
correspondence
with
me
all
the
time
i
was
at
guy
and
her
letters
had
been
more
interesting
and
amusing
than
her
conversation
generally
was
some
women
most
cultivated
women
can
write
charming
letters
and
julia
was
a
woman
i
came
back
from
guy
with
a
very
regard
and
admiration
for
my
cousin
julia
so
when
my
mother
with
her
pleading
wistful
eyes
spoke
day
after
day
of
julia
of
her
dutiful
love
toward
her
and
her
growing
love
for
me
i
drifted
almost
without
an
effort
of
my
own
volition
into
an
engagement
with
her
you
see
there
was
no
i
was
acquainted
with
every
girl
on
the
island
of
my
own
class
pretty
girls
were
many
of
them
but
there
was
after
all
not
one
that
i
preferred
to
my
cousin
my
old
dreams
and
romances
about
love
common
to
every
young
fellow
had
all
faded
into
a
very
commonplace
everyday
vision
of
having
a
comfortable
house
of
my
own
and
a
wife
as
good
as
most
other
wives
just
in
the
same
way
my
ambitious
plans
of
rising
to
the
very
top
of
the
tree
in
my
profession
had
dwindled
down
to
satisfaction
with
the
very
limited
practice
of
one
of
our
island
doctors
i
found
myself
chained
to
this
rock
in
the
sea
all
my
future
life
would
probably
be
spent
there
and
fate
offered
me
julia
as
the
companion
fittest
for
me
i
was
contented
with
my
fate
and
laughed
off
my
boyish
fancy
that
i
ought
to
be
ready
to
barter
the
world
for
love
added
to
these
two
strong
ties
keeping
me
in
guernsey
there
were
the
hundred
the
thousand
small
associations
which
made
that
island
and
my
people
living
upon
it
dearer
than
any
other
place
or
any
other
people
in
the
world
taking
the
strength
of
the
rope
which
held
me
to
the
as
represented
by
one
hundred
then
my
love
for
my
mother
would
stand
at
and
a
half
my
engagement
to
julia
at
about
twenty
and
the
remainder
may
go
toward
my
old
associations
that
is
pretty
nearly
the
sum
of
it
my
engagement
to
julia
came
about
so
easily
and
naturally
that
as
i
said
i
was
perfectly
contented
with
it
we
had
been
engaged
since
the
previous
christmas
and
were
to
be
married
in
the
early
summer
as
soon
as
a
trip
through
switzerland
would
be
agreeable
we
were
to
set
up
housekeeping
for
ourselves
that
was
a
point
julia
was
bent
upon
a
suitable
house
had
fallen
vacant
in
one
of
the
higher
streets
of
which
commanded
a
noble
view
of
the
sea
and
the
surrounding
islands
we
had
taken
it
though
it
was
farther
from
the
grange
and
my
mother
than
i
should
have
chosen
my
home
to
be
she
and
julia
were
busy
pleasantly
busy
about
the
furnishing
of
it
never
had
i
seen
my
mother
look
so
happy
or
so
young
even
my
father
paid
her
a
compliment
or
two
which
had
the
effect
of
bringing
a
pretty
pink
flush
to
her
white
cheeks
and
of
making
her
sunken
eyes
shine
as
to
myself
i
was
quietly
happy
without
a
doubt
julia
was
a
good
girl
everybody
said
that
and
julia
loved
me
devotedly
i
was
on
the
point
of
becoming
master
of
a
house
and
owner
of
a
considerable
income
for
julia
would
not
hear
of
there
being
any
marriage
settlements
which
would
secure
to
her
the
property
she
was
bringing
to
me
i
found
that
making
love
even
to
my
cousin
who
was
like
a
sister
to
me
was
upon
the
whole
a
pleasurable
occupation
every
thing
was
going
on
smoothly
that
was
till
about
the
middle
of
march
i
had
been
to
church
one
sunday
morning
with
these
two
women
both
devoted
to
me
and
centring
all
their
love
and
hopes
in
me
when
as
we
entered
the
house
on
our
return
i
heard
my
father
calling
martin
martin
as
loudly
as
he
could
from
his
i
answered
the
call
instantly
and
whom
should
i
see
but
a
very
old
friend
of
mine
tardif
of
the
havre
gosselin
he
was
standing
near
the
door
as
if
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
sit
down
his
handsome
but
face
betrayed
great
anxiety
and
his
shaggy
mustache
rose
and
fell
as
if
the
mouth
below
it
was
tremulously
at
work
my
father
looked
chagrined
and
irresolute
here
a
pretty
piece
of
work
martin
he
said
tardif
wants
one
of
us
to
go
back
with
him
to
sark
to
see
a
woman
who
has
fallen
from
the
cliffs
and
broken
her
arm
confound
it
for
the
sake
of
the
good
god
martin
cried
tardif
excitedly
and
of
course
speaking
in
the
sark
dialect
i
beg
of
you
to
come
this
instant
even
she
has
been
lying
in
anguish
since
yesterday
hours
now
sir
i
started
at
dawn
this
morning
but
both
wind
and
tide
were
against
me
and
i
have
been
waiting
here
some
time
be
quick
doctor
mon
dieu
if
she
should
be
dead
the
poor
fellow
voice
faltered
and
his
eyes
met
mine
imploringly
he
and
i
had
been
fast
friends
in
my
boyhood
when
all
my
holidays
were
spent
in
sark
though
he
was
some
years
older
than
i
and
our
friendship
was
still
firm
and
true
though
it
had
slackened
a
little
from
absence
i
shook
his
hand
heartily
giving
it
a
good
hard
grip
in
token
of
my
unaltered
friendship
a
grip
which
he
returned
with
his
fingers
of
iron
till
my
own
tingled
again
i
knew
you
come
he
gasped
ah
i
go
tardif
i
said
only
i
must
get
a
snatch
of
something
to
eat
while
dobrée
puts
up
what
i
shall
have
need
of
i
be
ready
in
half
an
hour
go
into
the
kitchen
and
get
some
dinner
yourself
thank
you
martin
he
answered
his
voice
still
unsteady
and
his
mustache
quivering
but
i
can
eat
nothing
i
go
down
and
have
the
boat
ready
you
waste
no
time
not
a
moment
i
promised
i
left
my
father
to
put
up
the
things
i
should
require
supposing
he
had
heard
all
the
particulars
of
the
accident
from
tardif
he
was
inclined
to
grumble
a
little
at
me
for
going
but
i
asked
him
what
else
i
could
have
done
as
he
had
no
answer
ready
to
that
question
i
walked
away
to
the
where
my
mother
and
julia
were
waiting
for
dinner
was
ready
as
we
dined
early
on
sundays
on
account
of
the
servants
julia
was
suffering
from
the
beginning
of
a
bilious
attack
to
which
she
was
subject
and
her
eyes
were
heavy
and
dull
i
told
them
hastily
where
i
was
going
and
what
a
hurry
i
was
in
you
are
never
going
across
to
sark
julia
exclaimed
why
not
i
asked
taking
my
seat
and
helping
myself
quickly
because
i
am
sure
bad
weather
is
coming
she
answered
looking
anxiously
through
a
window
facing
the
west
i
could
see
the
coast
of
france
this
morning
as
plainly
as
sark
and
the
gulls
are
keeping
close
to
the
shore
and
the
sunset
last
night
was
threatening
i
will
go
and
look
at
the
she
went
away
but
came
back
again
very
soon
with
an
increase
of
anxiety
in
her
face
do
go
dear
martin
she
said
with
her
hand
upon
my
shoulder
the
is
as
troubled
as
it
can
be
and
the
wind
is
veering
round
to
the
west
you
know
what
that
foretells
at
this
time
of
the
year
there
is
a
storm
at
hand
take
my
word
for
it
and
do
not
venture
across
to
sark
and
what
is
to
become
of
the
poor
woman
i
remonstrated
tardif
says
she
has
been
suffering
the
pain
of
a
broken
limb
these
hours
it
would
be
my
duty
to
go
even
if
the
storm
were
here
unless
the
risk
was
exceedingly
great
come
julia
remember
you
are
to
be
a
doctor
wife
and
do
be
a
coward
do
go
she
reiterated
for
my
sake
and
your
mother
i
am
certain
some
trouble
will
come
of
it
we
shall
be
frightened
to
death
and
this
woman
is
only
a
stranger
to
you
oh
i
can
not
bear
to
let
you
go
i
did
not
attempt
to
reason
with
her
for
i
knew
of
old
that
when
julia
was
bilious
and
nervous
she
was
quite
deaf
to
reason
i
only
stroked
the
hand
that
lay
on
my
shoulder
and
went
on
with
my
dinner
as
if
my
life
depended
upon
the
speed
with
which
i
dispatched
it
uncle
she
said
as
my
father
came
in
with
a
small
portmanteau
in
his
hand
tell
martin
he
must
not
go
there
is
sure
to
be
a
storm
pooh
pooh
he
answered
i
should
be
glad
enough
for
martin
to
stay
at
home
but
there
no
help
for
it
i
suppose
there
will
be
no
storm
at
present
and
they
run
across
quickly
it
will
be
the
coming
back
that
will
be
difficult
you
scarcely
get
home
again
martin
no
i
said
i
stop
at
gavey
and
come
back
in
the
sark
cutter
if
it
has
begun
to
ply
if
not
tardif
must
bring
me
over
in
the
morning
do
go
persisted
julia
as
i
thrust
myself
into
my
rough
and
then
bent
down
to
kiss
her
cheek
julia
always
presented
me
her
cheek
and
my
lips
had
never
met
hers
yet
my
mother
was
standing
by
and
looking
tearful
but
she
did
not
say
a
word
she
knew
there
was
no
question
about
what
i
ought
to
do
julia
followed
me
to
the
door
and
held
me
fast
with
both
hands
round
my
arm
sobbing
out
hysterically
do
go
even
when
i
had
released
myself
and
was
running
down
the
drive
i
could
hear
her
still
calling
o
martin
do
go
i
was
glad
to
get
out
of
hearing
i
felt
sorry
for
her
yet
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
pleasure
in
being
the
object
of
so
much
tender
solicitude
i
thought
of
her
for
a
minute
or
two
as
i
hurried
along
the
steep
streets
leading
down
to
the
quay
but
the
prospect
before
me
caught
my
eye
opposite
lay
sark
bathed
in
sunlight
and
the
sea
between
was
calm
enough
at
present
a
ride
across
with
a
westerly
breeze
filling
the
sails
and
the
boat
dancing
lightly
over
the
waves
would
not
be
a
bad
exchange
for
a
dull
sunday
afternoon
with
julia
at
the
and
my
mother
asleep
besides
it
was
the
path
of
duty
which
was
leading
me
across
the
quiet
gray
sea
before
me
tardif
was
waiting
with
his
sails
set
and
oars
in
the
rowlocks
ready
for
clearing
the
harbor
i
took
one
of
them
and
bent
myself
willingly
to
the
light
task
there
was
less
wind
than
i
had
expected
but
what
there
was
blew
in
our
favor
we
were
very
quickly
beyond
the
where
a
group
of
idlers
was
always
gathered
who
sent
after
us
a
few
warning
shouts
nothing
could
be
more
exhilarating
than
our
onward
progress
i
felt
as
if
i
had
been
a
prisoner
with
chains
which
had
pressed
heavily
yet
insensibly
upon
me
and
that
now
i
was
free
i
drew
into
my
lungs
the
fresh
bracing
salt
air
of
the
sea
with
a
deep
sigh
of
delight
chapter
the
second
a
patient
in
sark
it
struck
me
after
a
while
that
my
friend
tardif
was
unusually
silent
the
shifting
of
the
sails
appeared
to
give
him
plenty
to
do
and
to
my
surprise
instead
of
keeping
to
the
ordinary
course
he
ran
recklessly
as
it
seemed
across
the
which
lie
all
about
the
bed
of
the
channel
between
guernsey
and
sark
these
are
reefs
rising
a
little
above
low
water
but
as
the
tide
was
about
they
were
a
few
feet
below
it
yet
at
times
there
was
scarcely
enough
depth
to
float
us
over
them
while
the
brown
seaweed
torn
from
their
edges
lay
in
our
wake
something
like
the
swaths
of
grass
in
a
meadow
after
the
scythe
has
swept
through
it
now
and
then
came
a
bump
and
a
scrape
of
the
keel
against
their
sharp
ridges
the
sweat
stood
in
beads
upon
tardif
face
and
his
thick
hair
fell
forward
over
his
forehead
where
the
great
veins
in
the
temples
were
purple
and
swollen
i
spoke
to
him
after
a
heavier
bump
over
the
than
any
we
had
yet
come
to
tardif
i
said
we
are
shaving
the
weeds
a
little
too
close
we
look
behind
you
martin
he
answered
shifting
the
sails
a
little
i
did
not
look
behind
us
we
were
more
than
over
the
channel
and
guernsey
lay
four
miles
or
so
west
of
us
but
instead
of
the
clear
outline
of
the
island
standing
out
against
the
sky
i
could
see
nothing
but
a
bank
of
white
fog
the
afternoon
sun
was
shining
brightly
over
it
but
before
long
it
would
dip
into
its
dense
folds
the
fogs
about
our
islands
are
peculiar
you
may
see
them
form
apparently
thick
blocks
of
blanched
vapor
with
a
distinct
line
between
the
atmosphere
where
the
haze
is
and
where
it
is
not
to
be
overtaken
by
a
fog
like
this
which
would
almost
hide
tardif
at
one
end
of
the
boat
from
me
at
the
other
would
be
no
laughing
matter
in
a
sea
lined
with
sunken
reefs
the
wind
had
almost
gone
but
a
little
breeze
still
caught
us
from
the
north
of
the
without
a
word
i
took
the
oars
again
while
tardif
devoted
himself
to
the
sails
and
the
helm
a
mile
nearer
home
he
said
and
i
could
row
my
boat
as
easily
in
the
dark
as
you
could
ride
your
horse
along
a
lane
my
face
was
westward
now
and
i
kept
my
eye
upon
the
creeping
stealthily
after
us
i
thought
of
my
mother
and
julia
and
the
fright
they
would
be
in
moreover
a
fog
like
this
was
pretty
often
succeeded
by
a
squall
especially
at
this
season
and
when
a
westerly
gale
blew
up
from
the
atlantic
in
the
month
of
march
no
one
could
foretell
when
it
would
cease
i
had
been
in
sark
when
i
was
a
boy
for
three
weeks
at
one
time
when
our
provisions
ran
short
and
it
was
almost
impossible
to
buy
a
loaf
of
bread
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
recollection
but
i
kept
an
anxious
lookout
toward
the
west
three
weeks
imprisonment
in
sark
now
would
be
a
bore
but
the
fog
remained
almost
stationary
in
the
front
of
guernsey
and
the
round
red
eyeball
of
the
sun
glared
after
us
as
we
ran
nearer
and
nearer
to
sark
the
tide
was
with
us
and
carried
us
on
it
buoyantly
we
anchored
at
the
fisherman
below
the
cliff
of
the
havre
gosselin
and
i
climbed
readily
up
the
rough
ladder
which
leads
to
the
path
tardif
made
his
boat
secure
and
followed
me
he
passed
me
and
strode
on
up
the
steep
track
to
the
summit
of
the
cliff
as
if
impatient
to
reach
his
home
it
was
then
that
i
gave
my
first
serious
thought
to
the
woman
who
had
met
with
the
accident
tardif
who
is
this
person
that
is
hurt
i
asked
and
whereabout
did
she
fall
she
fell
down
yonder
he
answered
with
an
odd
quaver
in
his
voice
as
he
pointed
to
a
rough
and
rather
high
portion
of
the
cliff
running
inland
the
stones
rolled
from
under
her
feet
so
he
added
crushing
down
a
quantity
of
the
loose
gravel
with
his
foot
and
she
slipped
she
lay
on
the
shingle
underneath
for
two
hours
before
i
found
her
two
hours
dr
martin
that
was
bad
i
said
for
the
good
fellow
voice
failed
him
very
bad
a
fall
like
that
might
have
killed
her
we
went
on
he
carrying
his
oars
and
i
my
little
portmanteau
i
heard
tardif
muttering
killed
her
in
a
tone
of
terror
but
his
face
brightened
a
little
when
we
reached
the
gate
of
the
he
laid
down
the
oars
noiselessly
upon
the
narrow
stone
causeway
before
the
door
and
lifted
the
latch
as
cautiously
as
if
he
were
afraid
to
disturb
some
sleeping
baby
he
had
given
me
no
information
with
regard
to
my
patient
and
the
sole
idea
i
had
formed
of
her
was
of
a
strong
sturdy
sark
woman
whose
constitution
would
be
tough
and
her
temperament
of
a
stolid
phlegmatic
tone
there
was
not
ordinarily
much
sickness
among
them
and
this
case
was
evidently
one
of
pure
accident
i
expected
to
find
a
sunburnt
woman
with
a
rustic
face
who
would
very
probably
be
impatient
and
unreasonable
under
the
pain
i
should
be
compelled
to
inflict
upon
her
it
had
been
my
theory
that
a
medical
man
being
admitted
to
the
highest
degree
of
intimacy
with
his
patients
was
bound
to
be
as
insensible
as
an
anchorite
to
any
beauty
or
homeliness
in
those
whom
he
was
attending
professionally
he
should
have
eyes
only
for
the
malady
he
came
to
consider
and
relieve
dobrée
had
often
sneered
and
made
merry
at
my
notions
of
honor
and
duty
but
in
our
practice
at
home
he
had
given
me
no
opportunities
of
trying
them
he
had
attended
all
our
younger
and
more
attractive
patients
himself
and
had
handed
over
to
my
care
all
the
old
people
and
children
on
julia
account
he
had
said
laughing
tardif
mother
came
to
us
as
we
entered
the
house
she
was
a
little
ugly
woman
stone
deaf
as
i
knew
of
old
yet
in
some
mysterious
way
she
could
make
out
her
son
deep
voice
when
he
shouted
into
her
ear
he
did
not
speak
now
however
but
made
dumb
signs
as
if
to
ask
how
all
was
going
on
she
answered
by
a
silent
nod
and
beckoned
me
to
follow
her
into
an
inner
room
which
opened
out
of
the
kitchen
it
was
a
small
crowded
room
with
a
ceiling
so
low
it
seemed
to
rest
upon
the
four
posts
of
the
bedstead
there
were
of
course
none
of
the
little
dainty
luxuries
about
it
with
which
i
was
familiar
in
my
bedroom
a
long
low
window
opposite
the
head
of
the
bed
threw
a
strong
light
upon
it
there
were
check
curtains
drawn
round
it
and
a
and
rough
homespun
linen
every
thing
was
clean
but
coarse
and
frugal
such
as
i
expected
to
find
about
my
sark
patient
in
the
home
of
a
fisherman
but
when
my
eye
fell
upon
the
face
resting
on
the
rough
pillow
i
paused
involuntarily
only
just
controlling
an
explanation
of
surprise
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
the
surroundings
to
mark
her
as
a
lady
yet
i
felt
in
a
moment
that
she
was
one
there
lay
a
delicate
refined
face
white
as
the
linen
with
beautiful
lips
almost
as
white
and
a
mass
of
light
shining
silky
hair
tossed
about
the
pillow
and
large
eyes
gazing
at
me
beseechingly
with
an
expression
that
made
my
heart
leap
as
it
had
never
leaped
before
that
was
what
i
saw
and
could
not
forbear
seeing
i
tried
to
recall
my
theory
and
to
close
my
eyes
to
the
pathetic
beauty
of
the
face
before
me
but
it
was
altogether
in
vain
if
i
had
seen
her
before
or
if
i
had
been
prepared
to
see
any
one
like
her
i
might
have
succeeded
but
i
was
completely
thrown
off
my
guard
there
the
charming
face
lay
the
eyes
gleaming
the
white
forehead
tinted
and
the
delicate
mouth
contracting
with
pain
the
bright
silky
curls
tossed
about
in
confusion
i
see
it
now
just
as
i
saw
it
then
chapter
the
third
without
resources
i
suppose
i
did
not
stand
still
more
than
five
seconds
yet
during
that
pause
a
host
of
questions
had
flashed
through
my
brain
who
was
this
beautiful
creature
where
had
she
come
from
how
did
it
happen
that
she
was
in
tardif
house
and
so
on
but
i
recalled
myself
sharply
to
my
senses
i
was
here
as
her
physician
and
and
duty
demanded
of
me
to
keep
my
head
clear
i
advanced
to
her
side
and
took
the
small
hand
in
mine
and
felt
her
pulse
with
my
fingers
it
beat
under
them
a
low
but
fast
measure
too
fast
by
a
great
deal
i
could
see
that
the
general
condition
of
her
health
was
perfect
a
great
charm
in
itself
to
me
but
she
had
been
bearing
acute
pain
for
over
hours
and
she
was
becoming
exhausted
a
shudder
ran
through
me
at
the
thought
of
that
long
spell
of
suffering
you
are
in
very
great
pain
i
fear
i
said
lowering
my
voice
yes
her
white
lips
answered
and
she
tried
to
smile
a
patient
though
a
dreary
smile
as
she
looked
up
into
my
face
my
arm
is
broken
are
you
a
doctor
i
am
martin
dobrée
i
said
passing
my
hand
softly
down
her
arm
the
fracture
was
above
the
elbow
and
was
of
a
kind
to
make
the
setting
of
it
give
her
considerable
pain
i
could
see
she
was
scarce
fit
to
bear
any
further
suffering
just
then
but
what
was
to
be
done
she
was
not
likely
to
get
much
rest
till
the
bone
was
set
have
you
had
much
sleep
since
your
fall
i
asked
looking
at
the
weariness
visible
in
her
eyes
not
any
she
replied
not
one
moment
sleep
did
you
have
no
sleep
all
night
i
inquired
again
no
she
said
i
could
not
fall
asleep
there
were
two
things
i
could
do
give
her
an
opiate
and
strengthen
her
a
little
with
sleep
beforehand
or
administer
chloroform
to
her
before
the
operation
i
hesitated
between
the
two
a
natural
sleep
would
have
done
her
a
world
of
good
but
there
was
a
gleam
in
her
eyes
and
a
feverish
throb
in
her
pulse
which
gave
me
no
hope
of
that
perhaps
the
chloroform
if
she
had
no
objection
to
it
would
be
the
best
did
you
ever
take
chloroform
i
asked
no
i
never
needed
it
she
answered
should
you
object
to
taking
it
any
thing
she
replied
passively
i
will
do
any
thing
you
wish
i
went
back
into
the
kitchen
and
opened
the
portmanteau
my
father
had
put
up
for
me
splints
and
bandages
were
there
in
abundance
enough
to
set
half
the
arms
in
the
island
but
neither
chloroform
nor
any
thing
in
the
shape
of
an
opiate
could
i
find
i
might
almost
as
well
have
come
to
sark
altogether
unprepared
for
my
case
what
could
i
do
there
are
no
shops
in
sark
and
drugs
of
any
kind
were
out
of
the
question
there
was
not
a
chance
of
getting
what
i
needed
to
calm
and
soothe
a
and
temperament
like
my
patient
a
few
minutes
ago
i
had
hesitated
about
using
chloroform
now
i
would
have
given
half
of
every
thing
i
possessed
in
the
world
for
an
ounce
of
it
i
said
nothing
to
tardif
who
was
watching
me
with
his
eyes
as
closely
as
if
i
were
meddling
with
some
precious
possession
of
his
own
i
laid
the
bundle
of
splints
and
rolls
of
linen
down
on
the
table
with
a
professional
air
while
i
was
inwardly
execrating
my
negligence
i
emptied
the
portmanteau
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
small
phial
or
box
any
opiate
would
have
been
welcome
to
me
that
would
have
dulled
the
overwrought
nerves
of
the
girl
in
the
room
within
but
the
practice
of
using
any
thing
of
the
kind
was
not
in
favor
with
us
generally
in
the
channel
islands
and
my
father
had
probably
concluded
that
a
sark
woman
would
not
consent
to
use
them
at
any
rate
there
they
were
not
i
stood
for
a
few
minutes
deep
in
thought
the
daylight
was
going
and
it
was
useless
to
waste
time
yet
i
found
myself
shrinking
oddly
from
the
duty
before
me
tardif
could
not
help
but
see
my
chagrin
and
hesitation
doctor
he
cried
she
is
not
going
to
die
no
no
i
answered
calling
back
my
wandering
thoughts
and
energies
there
is
not
the
smallest
danger
of
that
i
must
go
and
set
her
arm
at
once
and
then
she
will
sleep
i
returned
to
the
room
and
raised
her
as
gently
and
painlessly
as
i
could
motioning
to
the
old
woman
to
sit
beside
her
on
the
bed
and
hold
her
steadily
i
thought
once
of
calling
in
tardif
to
support
her
with
his
strong
frame
but
i
did
not
she
moaned
though
very
softly
when
i
moved
her
and
she
tried
to
smile
again
as
her
eyes
met
mine
looking
anxiously
at
her
that
smile
made
me
feel
like
a
child
if
she
did
it
again
i
knew
my
hands
would
be
unsteady
and
her
pain
would
be
tenfold
greater
i
would
rather
you
cried
out
or
shouted
i
said
do
try
to
control
yourself
when
i
hurt
you
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
seeming
impatient
and
a
loud
scream
or
two
would
do
you
good
but
i
knew
quite
well
as
i
spoke
that
she
would
never
scream
aloud
there
was
the
of
culture
about
her
a
woman
of
the
lower
class
might
shriek
and
cry
but
this
girl
would
try
to
smile
at
the
moment
when
the
pain
was
keenest
the
white
round
arm
under
my
hands
was
cold
and
the
muscles
were
soft
and
unstrung
i
felt
the
ends
of
the
broken
bone
grating
together
as
i
drew
the
fragments
into
their
right
places
and
the
sensation
went
through
and
through
me
i
had
set
scores
of
broken
limbs
before
with
no
feeling
like
this
which
was
so
near
unnerving
me
but
i
kept
my
hands
steady
and
my
attention
fixed
upon
my
work
i
felt
like
two
persons
a
surgeon
who
had
a
simple
scientific
operation
to
perform
and
a
mother
who
feels
in
her
own
person
every
pang
her
child
has
to
suffer
all
the
time
the
girl
white
face
and
lips
lay
under
my
gaze
with
the
unflinching
eyes
looking
straight
at
me
a
mournful
silent
appealing
face
which
betrayed
the
pain
i
made
her
suffer
ten
times
more
than
any
cries
or
shrieks
could
have
done
i
thanked
god
in
my
heart
when
it
was
over
and
i
could
lay
her
down
again
i
smoothed
the
coarse
pillows
for
her
to
lie
more
comfortably
upon
them
and
i
spread
my
cambric
handkerchief
in
a
double
fold
between
her
cheek
and
the
rough
linen
too
rough
for
a
soft
cheek
like
hers
lie
quite
still
i
said
do
not
stir
but
go
to
sleep
as
fast
as
you
can
she
was
not
smiling
now
and
she
did
not
speak
but
the
gleam
in
her
eyes
was
growing
wilder
and
she
looked
at
me
with
a
wandering
expression
if
sleep
did
not
come
very
soon
there
would
be
mischief
i
drew
the
curtains
across
the
window
to
shut
out
the
twilight
and
motioned
to
the
old
woman
to
sit
quietly
by
the
side
of
our
patient
then
i
went
out
to
tardif
he
had
not
stirred
from
the
place
and
position
in
which
i
had
left
him
i
am
sure
no
sound
could
have
reached
him
from
the
inner
room
for
we
had
been
so
still
that
during
the
whole
time
i
could
hear
the
beat
of
the
sea
dashing
up
between
the
high
cliffs
of
the
havre
gosselin
up
and
down
went
tardif
shaggy
mustache
the
surest
indication
of
emotion
with
him
and
he
fetched
his
breath
almost
with
a
sob
well
dr
martin
was
all
he
said
the
arm
is
set
i
answered
and
now
she
must
get
some
sleep
there
is
not
the
least
danger
tardif
only
we
will
keep
the
house
as
quiet
as
possible
i
must
go
and
bring
in
the
boat
he
replied
bestirring
himself
as
if
some
spell
was
at
an
end
there
will
be
a
storm
and
i
should
sleep
the
sounder
if
she
was
safe
ashore
i
come
with
you
i
said
glad
to
get
away
from
the
seaweed
fire
it
was
not
quite
dark
and
the
cliffs
stood
out
against
the
sky
in
odder
and
more
grotesque
shapes
than
by
daylight
a
host
of
seamews
were
fluttering
about
and
uttering
the
most
unearthly
hootings
but
the
sea
was
as
yet
quite
calm
save
where
it
broke
in
wavering
serpentine
lines
over
the
submerged
reefs
which
encircle
the
island
the
tidal
current
was
pouring
rapidly
through
the
very
narrow
channel
between
sark
and
the
little
isle
of
breckhou
and
its
eddies
stretching
to
us
made
it
rather
an
arduous
task
to
get
tardif
boat
on
shore
safely
but
the
work
was
pleasant
just
then
it
kept
our
minds
away
from
useless
anxieties
about
the
girl
an
hour
passed
quickly
and
up
the
ravine
in
the
deep
gloom
of
the
overhanging
rocks
we
made
our
way
homeward
you
will
not
quit
the
island
said
tardif
standing
at
his
door
and
scanning
the
sky
with
his
keen
eyes
i
must
i
answered
i
must
indeed
old
fellow
you
are
no
and
you
will
run
me
over
in
the
morning
no
boat
will
leave
sark
said
tardif
shaking
his
head
we
went
in
and
he
threw
off
his
jacket
and
rolled
up
his
sleeves
preparatory
to
frying
some
fish
for
supper
i
was
beginning
to
feel
ravenously
hungry
for
i
had
eaten
nothing
since
dinner
and
as
far
as
i
knew
tardif
had
had
nothing
since
his
early
breakfast
but
as
a
fisherman
he
was
used
to
long
spells
of
fasting
while
he
was
busy
cooking
i
stole
quietly
into
the
inner
room
to
look
after
my
patient
the
feeble
light
entering
by
the
door
which
i
left
open
showed
me
the
old
woman
comfortably
asleep
in
her
chair
but
not
so
the
girl
i
had
told
her
when
i
laid
her
down
that
she
must
lie
quite
still
and
she
was
obeying
me
implicitly
her
cheek
still
rested
upon
my
handkerchief
and
the
broken
arm
remained
undisturbed
upon
the
pillow
which
i
had
placed
under
it
but
her
eyes
were
wide
open
and
shining
in
the
dimness
and
i
fancied
i
could
see
her
lips
moving
incessantly
though
soundlessly
i
laid
my
hand
across
her
eyes
and
felt
the
long
lashes
brush
against
the
palm
but
the
eyelids
did
not
remain
closed
you
must
go
to
sleep
i
said
speaking
distinctly
and
authoritatively
wondering
at
the
time
how
much
power
my
will
would
have
over
her
did
i
possess
any
of
that
magnetic
tranquillizing
influence
about
which
jack
senior
and
i
had
so
often
laughed
incredulously
at
guy
her
lips
moved
fast
for
now
my
eyes
had
grown
used
to
the
dim
light
i
could
see
her
face
plainly
but
i
could
not
catch
a
syllable
of
what
she
was
whispering
so
busily
to
herself
never
had
i
felt
so
helpless
and
disconcerted
in
the
presence
of
a
patient
i
could
positively
do
nothing
for
her
the
case
was
not
beyond
my
skill
but
all
medicinal
resources
were
beyond
my
reach
sleep
she
must
have
yet
how
was
i
to
administer
it
to
her
i
returned
troubled
and
irritable
to
search
once
more
my
empty
portmanteau
empty
it
was
except
of
the
current
number
of
which
my
father
had
considerately
packed
among
the
splints
for
my
reading
i
flung
it
and
the
bag
across
the
kitchen
with
an
ejaculation
not
at
all
flattering
to
dobrée
nor
in
accordance
with
the
fifth
commandment
what
is
the
matter
doctor
inquired
tardif
i
told
him
in
a
few
sharp
words
what
i
wanted
to
soothe
my
patient
in
an
instant
he
left
his
cooking
and
thrust
his
arms
into
his
blue
jacket
again
you
can
finish
it
yourself
martin
he
said
hurriedly
i
run
over
to
old
mother
renouf
she
have
some
herbs
or
something
to
send
to
sleep
bring
her
back
with
you
i
shouted
after
him
as
he
sped
across
the
yard
mother
renouf
was
no
stranger
to
me
while
i
was
a
boy
she
had
charmed
my
warts
away
and
healed
the
bruises
which
were
the
inevitable
consequences
of
i
scarcely
liked
her
coming
in
to
fill
up
my
deficiencies
and
i
knew
our
application
to
her
for
help
would
be
inexpressibly
gratifying
but
i
had
no
other
resource
than
to
call
her
in
as
a
and
i
knew
she
would
make
a
nurse
for
which
suzanne
tardif
was
unfitted
by
her
deafness
chapter
the
fourth
a
rival
practitioner
mother
renouf
arrived
from
the
other
end
of
the
island
in
an
incredibly
short
time
borne
along
by
tardif
as
if
he
were
a
whirlwind
and
she
a
leaf
caught
in
its
current
she
was
a
short
squat
old
woman
with
a
skin
tanned
like
leather
and
kindly
little
blue
eyes
twinkling
with
delight
and
pride
yes
there
they
are
photographed
somewhere
in
my
brain
the
wrinkled
yellow
withered
faces
of
the
two
old
women
their
watery
eyes
and
toothless
mouths
with
figures
as
shapeless
as
the
bowlders
on
the
beach
watching
beside
the
bed
where
lay
the
white
but
tenderly
beautiful
face
of
the
young
girl
with
her
curls
of
glossy
hair
tossed
about
the
pillow
and
her
long
tremulous
eyelashes
making
a
shadow
on
her
rounded
cheek
mother
renouf
gave
me
a
hearty
tap
on
the
shoulder
and
chuckled
as
merrily
as
the
shortness
of
her
breath
after
her
rapid
course
would
permit
the
few
english
phrases
she
knew
fell
far
short
of
expressing
her
triumph
and
exultation
but
i
was
resolved
to
confer
with
her
affably
my
patient
case
was
too
serious
for
me
to
stand
upon
my
dignity
mother
i
said
have
you
any
simples
to
send
this
poor
girl
to
sleep
tardif
told
me
you
had
taken
her
sprained
ankle
under
your
charge
i
find
i
have
nothing
with
me
to
induce
sleep
and
you
can
help
us
if
any
one
can
leave
her
to
me
my
dear
little
doctor
she
answered
a
laugh
gurgling
in
her
thick
throat
leave
her
to
me
you
have
done
your
part
with
the
bones
i
have
no
touch
at
all
for
broken
limbs
though
my
father
good
man
could
handle
them
with
any
doctor
in
all
the
islands
but
i
send
her
to
sleep
for
you
never
fear
you
will
stay
with
us
all
night
i
said
coaxingly
suzanne
is
deaf
and
ears
are
of
use
in
a
you
know
i
intended
to
go
to
gavey
but
i
shall
throw
myself
down
here
on
the
fern
bed
and
you
can
call
me
at
any
moment
if
there
is
need
there
will
be
no
need
she
replied
in
a
tone
of
confidence
my
little
will
be
sound
asleep
in
ten
minutes
after
she
has
taken
my
draught
i
went
into
the
room
with
her
to
have
a
look
at
our
patient
she
had
not
stirred
yet
but
was
precisely
in
the
position
in
which
i
placed
her
after
the
operation
was
ended
there
was
something
peculiar
about
this
which
distressed
me
i
asked
mother
renouf
to
move
her
gently
and
bring
her
face
more
toward
me
the
burning
eyes
opened
widely
as
soon
as
she
felt
the
old
woman
arm
under
her
and
she
looked
up
with
a
flash
of
intelligence
into
my
face
i
stooped
down
to
catch
the
whisper
with
which
her
lips
were
moving
you
told
me
not
to
stir
she
murmured
yes
i
said
but
you
are
not
to
lie
still
till
you
are
cramped
and
stiff
are
you
in
much
pain
now
he
told
me
not
to
stir
muttered
the
parched
lips
again
not
to
stir
i
must
lie
quite
still
quite
still
quite
still
the
feeble
voice
died
away
as
she
whispered
the
last
words
but
her
lips
went
on
moving
as
if
she
was
repeating
them
to
herself
still
certainly
there
was
mischief
here
my
last
order
given
just
before
her
mind
began
to
wander
had
taken
possession
of
her
brain
and
retained
authority
over
her
will
there
was
a
pathetic
obedience
in
her
perfect
immobility
united
with
the
shifting
restless
glance
of
her
eyes
and
the
ceaseless
ripple
of
movement
about
her
mouth
which
made
me
trebly
anxious
and
uneasy
a
dominant
idea
had
taken
hold
upon
her
which
might
prove
dangerous
i
was
glad
when
mother
renouf
had
finished
stewing
her
decoction
of
and
brought
the
nauseous
draught
for
the
girl
to
drink
but
whether
the
had
lost
their
virtue
or
our
nervous
condition
had
become
too
critical
too
full
of
excitement
and
disturbance
i
can
not
tell
it
is
certain
that
she
was
not
sleeping
in
ten
minutes
or
in
an
hour
time
old
dame
tardif
went
off
to
her
bedroom
and
mother
renouf
took
her
place
by
the
girl
side
tardif
could
not
be
persuaded
to
leave
the
kitchen
though
he
appeared
to
be
falling
asleep
heavily
waking
up
at
intervals
and
starting
with
terror
at
the
least
sound
for
myself
i
scarcely
slept
at
all
though
i
found
the
fern
bed
a
tolerably
comfortable
the
gale
that
tardif
had
foretold
came
with
great
violence
about
the
middle
of
the
night
the
wind
howled
up
the
long
narrow
ravine
like
a
pack
of
wolves
mighty
storms
of
hail
and
rain
beat
in
torrents
against
the
windows
and
the
sea
lifted
up
its
voice
with
unmistakable
energy
now
and
again
a
stronger
gust
than
the
others
appeared
to
threaten
to
carry
off
the
thatched
roof
bodily
and
leave
us
exposed
to
the
tempest
with
only
the
thick
stone
walls
about
us
and
the
latch
of
the
outer
door
rattled
as
if
some
one
outside
was
striving
to
enter
i
am
not
fanciful
but
just
then
the
notion
came
across
me
that
if
that
door
opened
we
should
see
the
grim
skeleton
death
on
the
threshold
with
his
bleached
unclad
bones
dripping
with
the
storm
i
laughed
at
the
ghastly
fancy
and
told
it
to
tardif
in
one
of
his
waking
intervals
but
he
was
so
terrified
and
troubled
by
it
that
it
grew
to
have
some
little
importance
in
my
own
eyes
so
the
night
wore
slowly
away
the
tall
clock
in
the
corner
ticking
out
the
seconds
and
striking
the
hours
with
a
fidelity
to
its
duty
which
helped
to
keep
me
awake
twice
or
thrice
i
crept
with
quite
unnecessary
caution
into
the
room
of
my
patient
no
there
was
no
symptom
of
sleep
there
the
pulse
grew
more
rapid
the
temples
throbbed
and
the
fever
gained
ground
mother
renouf
was
ready
to
weep
with
vexation
the
girl
herself
sobbed
and
shuddered
at
the
loud
sounds
of
the
tempest
without
but
yet
by
a
firm
supreme
effort
of
her
will
which
was
exhausting
her
strength
dangerously
she
kept
herself
quite
still
i
would
have
given
up
a
year
or
two
of
my
life
to
be
able
to
set
her
free
from
the
bondage
of
my
own
command
chapter
the
fifth
locks
of
hair
the
westerly
gale
rising
every
few
hours
into
a
squall
gave
me
no
chance
of
leaving
sark
the
next
day
nor
for
some
days
afterward
but
i
was
not
at
all
put
out
by
my
captivity
all
my
interest
my
whole
being
in
fact
was
absorbed
in
the
care
of
this
girl
stranger
as
she
was
i
thought
and
moved
lived
and
breathed
only
to
fight
step
by
step
against
delirium
and
death
and
to
fight
without
my
accustomed
weapons
sometimes
i
could
do
nothing
but
watch
the
onset
and
inroads
of
the
fever
most
helplessly
there
was
no
possibility
of
aid
the
stormy
waters
which
beat
against
that
little
rock
in
the
sea
came
swelling
and
rolling
in
from
the
vast
plain
of
the
atlantic
and
broke
in
tempestuous
surf
against
the
island
the
wind
howled
and
the
rain
and
hail
beat
across
us
almost
incessantly
for
two
days
and
tardif
himself
was
kept
a
prisoner
in
the
house
except
when
he
went
to
look
after
his
no
doubt
it
would
have
been
practicable
for
me
to
get
as
far
as
the
hotel
but
to
what
good
it
would
be
quite
deserted
for
there
were
no
visitors
to
sark
at
this
season
and
i
did
not
give
it
a
second
thought
i
was
entirely
engrossed
in
my
patient
and
i
learned
for
the
first
time
what
their
task
is
who
hour
after
hour
watch
the
progress
of
disease
in
the
person
of
one
dear
to
them
tardif
occupied
himself
with
mending
his
nets
pausing
frequently
with
his
solemn
eyes
fixed
upon
the
door
of
the
girl
room
very
much
as
a
patient
mastiff
watches
the
spot
where
he
knows
his
master
is
near
to
him
though
out
of
sight
his
mother
went
about
her
household
work
ploddingly
and
mother
renouf
kept
manfully
to
her
post
in
turn
with
me
as
sentinel
over
the
sickbed
there
the
young
girl
lay
whispering
from
morning
till
night
and
from
night
till
morning
again
always
whispering
the
fever
gained
ground
from
hour
to
hour
i
had
no
data
by
which
to
calculate
her
chances
of
getting
through
it
but
my
hopes
were
very
low
at
times
on
the
tuesday
afternoon
in
a
temporary
lull
of
the
hail
and
wind
i
started
off
on
a
walk
across
the
island
the
wind
was
still
blowing
from
the
southwest
and
filling
all
the
narrow
sea
between
us
and
guernsey
with
boiling
surge
very
angry
looked
the
masses
of
foam
whirling
about
the
sunken
reefs
and
very
ominous
the
hard
blocks
of
clouds
all
along
the
horizon
i
strolled
as
far
as
the
coupée
that
giddy
pathway
between
great
and
little
sark
where
one
can
see
the
seething
of
the
waves
at
the
feet
of
the
cliffs
on
both
sides
three
hundred
feet
below
one
something
like
a
panic
seized
me
my
nerves
were
too
far
unstrung
for
me
to
venture
across
the
long
narrow
isthmus
i
turned
abruptly
again
and
hurried
as
fast
as
my
legs
would
carry
me
back
to
tardif
cottage
i
had
been
away
less
than
an
hour
but
an
advantage
had
been
taken
of
my
absence
i
found
tardif
seated
at
the
table
with
a
tangle
of
silky
shining
hair
lying
before
him
a
tear
or
two
had
fallen
upon
it
from
his
eyes
i
understood
at
a
glance
what
it
meant
mother
renouf
had
cut
off
my
patient
pretty
curls
as
soon
as
i
was
out
of
the
house
i
could
not
be
angry
with
her
though
i
did
not
suppose
it
would
do
much
good
and
i
felt
a
sort
of
resentment
such
as
a
mother
would
feel
at
this
sacrifice
of
a
natural
beauty
they
were
all
disordered
and
ravelled
tardif
great
hand
caressed
them
tenderly
and
i
drew
out
one
long
glossy
tress
and
wound
it
about
my
fingers
with
a
heavy
heart
it
is
like
the
pretty
feathers
of
a
bird
that
has
been
wounded
said
tardif
sorrowfully
just
then
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
sharp
click
of
the
latch
loud
enough
to
penetrate
dame
tardif
deaf
ears
or
to
arouse
our
patient
if
she
had
been
sleeping
before
either
of
us
could
move
the
door
was
thrust
open
and
two
young
ladies
appeared
upon
the
they
were
it
flashed
across
me
in
an
instant
old
and
friends
of
julia
i
declare
to
you
honestly
i
had
scarcely
had
one
thought
of
julia
till
now
my
mother
i
had
wished
for
to
take
her
place
by
this
poor
girl
side
but
julia
had
hardly
crossed
my
mind
why
in
heaven
name
should
the
appearance
of
these
friends
of
hers
be
so
distasteful
to
me
just
now
i
had
known
them
all
my
life
and
liked
them
as
well
as
any
girls
i
knew
but
at
this
moment
the
very
sight
of
them
was
annoying
they
stood
in
the
doorway
as
much
astonished
and
thunderstricken
as
i
was
glaring
at
me
so
it
seemed
to
me
with
that
soft
lock
of
hair
curling
and
clinging
round
my
finger
never
had
i
felt
so
foolish
or
guilty
martin
dobrée
ejaculated
both
in
one
breath
yes
mesdemoiselles
i
said
uncoiling
the
tress
of
hair
as
if
it
had
been
a
serpent
and
going
forward
to
greet
them
are
you
surprised
to
see
me
surprised
echoed
the
elder
no
we
are
amazed
petrified
however
did
you
get
here
when
did
you
come
quite
easily
i
replied
i
came
on
sunday
and
tardif
fetched
me
in
his
own
boat
if
the
weather
had
permitted
i
should
have
paid
you
a
call
but
you
know
what
it
has
been
to
be
sure
answered
emma
and
how
is
dear
julia
she
will
be
very
anxious
about
you
she
was
on
the
verge
of
a
bilious
attack
when
i
left
her
i
said
that
will
tend
to
increase
her
anxiety
poor
dear
girl
she
replied
sympathetically
but
martin
is
this
young
woman
here
so
very
ill
we
have
heard
from
the
renoufs
she
had
had
a
dangerous
fall
to
think
of
your
being
in
sark
ever
since
sunday
and
we
never
heard
a
word
of
it
no
thanks
to
tardif
quiet
tongue
and
mother
renouf
assiduous
attendance
upon
my
sojourn
in
the
island
had
been
kept
a
secret
now
that
was
at
an
end
is
that
the
young
woman
hair
asked
emma
as
tardif
gathered
together
the
scattered
tresses
and
tied
them
up
quickly
in
a
little
white
handkerchief
out
of
their
sight
and
mine
i
saw
them
again
afterward
the
handkerchief
had
been
his
wife
white
with
a
border
of
pink
roses
yes
i
replied
to
her
question
it
was
necessary
to
cut
it
off
she
is
dangerously
ill
with
fever
both
of
them
shrank
a
little
toward
the
door
a
sudden
temptation
assailed
me
and
took
me
so
much
by
surprise
that
i
had
yielded
before
i
knew
i
was
attacked
it
was
their
shrinking
movement
that
did
it
my
answer
was
almost
as
automatic
and
involuntary
as
their
retreat
you
see
it
would
not
be
wise
for
any
of
us
to
go
about
i
said
a
fever
breaking
out
in
the
island
especially
now
you
have
no
resident
doctor
would
be
very
serious
i
think
it
will
be
best
to
isolate
this
case
till
we
see
the
nature
of
the
fever
you
will
do
me
a
favor
by
warning
the
people
away
from
us
at
present
the
storm
has
saved
us
so
far
but
now
we
must
take
other
precautions
this
i
said
with
a
grave
tone
and
face
knowing
all
the
while
that
there
was
no
fear
whatever
for
the
people
of
sark
was
there
a
propensity
in
me
not
hitherto
developed
to
make
the
worst
of
a
case
martin
cried
emma
backing
out
through
the
open
door
come
away
maria
we
have
run
no
risk
yet
martin
have
we
do
not
come
any
nearer
to
us
we
have
touched
nothing
except
shaking
hands
with
you
are
we
quite
safe
is
the
young
woman
so
very
ill
inquired
maria
from
a
safe
distance
outside
the
house
i
shook
my
head
in
silence
and
pointed
to
the
door
of
the
inner
room
intimating
to
them
that
she
was
no
farther
away
than
there
an
expression
of
horror
came
over
both
their
faces
scarcely
waiting
to
bestow
upon
me
a
gesture
of
farewell
they
fled
and
i
saw
them
hurrying
with
unusual
rapidity
across
the
fold
i
had
at
least
secured
isolation
for
myself
and
my
patient
but
why
had
i
been
eager
to
do
so
i
could
not
answer
that
question
to
myself
and
i
did
not
ponder
over
it
many
minutes
i
was
impatient
yet
strangely
reluctant
to
look
at
the
sick
girl
again
after
the
loss
of
her
beautiful
hair
it
was
still
daylight
the
change
in
her
appearance
struck
me
as
singular
her
face
before
had
a
look
of
suffering
and
trouble
making
it
almost
old
charming
as
it
was
now
she
had
the
aspect
of
quite
a
young
girl
scarcely
touching
upon
womanhood
her
hair
had
not
been
shorn
off
closely
the
woman
could
not
manage
that
and
short
wavy
tresses
like
those
of
a
young
child
were
curling
about
her
head
the
white
temples
with
their
blue
throbbing
veins
were
more
visible
with
the
small
ears
i
should
have
guessed
her
age
now
as
barely
fifteen
almost
that
of
a
child
thus
changed
i
felt
more
myself
in
her
presence
more
as
i
should
have
been
in
attendance
upon
any
child
i
scanned
her
face
narrowly
and
it
struck
me
that
there
was
a
perceptible
alteration
an
expression
of
exhaustion
or
repose
was
creeping
over
it
the
crisis
of
the
fever
was
at
hand
the
repose
of
death
or
the
wholesome
sleep
of
returning
health
was
not
far
off
mother
renouf
saw
it
as
well
as
myself
chapter
the
sixth
who
is
she
we
sat
up
again
together
that
night
tardif
and
i
he
would
not
smoke
lest
the
scent
of
the
tobacco
should
get
in
through
the
crevices
of
the
door
and
lessen
the
girl
chance
of
sleep
but
he
held
his
pipe
between
his
teeth
taking
an
imaginary
puff
now
and
then
that
he
might
keep
himself
wide
awake
we
talked
to
one
another
in
whispers
tell
me
all
you
know
about
i
said
he
had
been
chary
of
his
knowledge
before
but
his
heart
seemed
open
at
this
moment
most
hearts
are
more
open
at
midnight
than
at
any
other
hour
there
not
much
to
tell
doctor
he
answered
her
name
is
ollivier
as
i
said
to
you
but
she
does
not
think
she
is
any
kin
to
the
olliviers
of
guernsey
she
is
poor
though
she
does
not
look
as
if
she
had
been
born
poor
does
she
not
in
the
least
degree
i
said
if
she
is
not
a
lady
of
birth
she
is
one
of
the
first
specimens
of
nature
gentlefolks
i
have
ever
come
across
ah
there
is
a
difference
he
said
sighing
i
feel
it
doctor
in
every
word
i
speak
to
her
and
every
step
i
walk
with
her
eyes
upon
me
why
can
not
i
be
like
her
or
like
you
you
be
on
a
level
with
her
and
i
am
down
far
below
her
i
looked
at
him
curiously
the
slouching
figure
well
shaped
as
it
was
the
rough
knotted
hands
the
unkempt
mass
of
hair
about
his
head
and
face
marked
him
for
what
he
was
a
toiler
on
the
sea
as
well
as
on
the
land
he
understood
my
scrutiny
and
colored
under
it
like
a
girl
you
are
a
better
fellow
than
i
am
tardif
i
said
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
talk
i
think
we
ought
to
communicate
with
the
young
lady
friends
whoever
they
may
be
as
soon
as
there
are
any
means
of
communicating
with
the
rest
of
the
world
we
should
be
in
a
fix
if
any
thing
should
happen
to
her
have
you
no
clew
to
her
friends
she
is
not
going
to
die
he
cried
no
no
doctor
god
must
hear
my
prayers
for
her
i
have
never
ceased
to
lift
up
my
voice
to
him
in
my
heart
since
i
found
her
on
the
shingle
she
will
not
die
i
am
not
so
sure
i
said
but
in
any
case
we
should
write
to
her
friends
has
she
written
to
any
one
since
she
came
here
not
to
a
soul
he
answered
eagerly
she
told
me
she
has
no
friends
nearer
than
australia
that
is
a
great
way
off
and
has
she
had
no
letters
i
asked
not
one
he
replied
she
has
neither
written
nor
received
a
single
letter
but
how
did
you
come
across
her
i
inquired
she
did
not
fall
from
the
skies
i
suppose
how
was
it
she
came
to
live
in
this
place
with
you
tardif
smoked
his
imaginary
pipe
with
great
perseverance
for
some
minutes
his
face
overcast
with
thought
but
presently
it
cleared
and
he
turned
to
me
with
a
frank
smile
i
tell
you
all
about
it
martin
he
said
you
know
the
seigneur
was
in
london
last
autumn
and
there
was
a
little
difficulty
in
the
court
of
chefs
plaids
here
about
an
ordonnance
we
could
not
agree
over
and
i
went
across
to
london
to
see
the
seigneur
for
myself
it
was
in
coming
back
i
met
with
ollivier
i
was
paying
my
fare
at
waterloo
station
the
i
mean
and
i
was
turning
away
when
i
heard
the
man
speak
grumblingly
i
thought
it
was
at
me
and
i
looked
back
and
there
she
stood
before
him
looking
scared
and
frightened
at
his
rough
words
doctor
i
never
could
bear
to
see
any
soft
tender
young
thing
in
trouble
if
it
nothing
but
a
little
bird
that
has
fallen
out
of
its
warm
nest
or
a
lamb
slipped
down
among
the
cliffs
i
feel
as
if
i
could
risk
my
life
to
put
them
back
again
in
some
safe
place
yes
and
i
have
done
it
scores
of
times
when
i
dared
not
let
my
poor
mother
know
well
there
stood
pale
and
trembling
with
the
tears
ready
to
fall
in
her
eyes
just
such
a
soft
poor
tender
soul
as
my
little
wife
used
to
be
you
remember
my
little
wife
dr
martin
i
only
nodded
as
he
looked
at
me
just
such
another
he
went
on
only
this
one
was
a
lady
and
less
able
to
take
care
of
herself
her
trouble
was
nothing
but
the
and
she
had
no
change
nothing
but
an
australian
sovereign
so
i
paid
it
for
her
i
kept
pretty
near
her
about
the
station
while
she
was
buying
her
ticket
for
i
overheard
two
young
men
who
were
roaming
up
and
down
say
as
they
looked
at
her
de
gants
et
des
souliers
de
velours
that
was
true
she
had
no
gloves
on
her
hands
and
her
little
feet
had
nothing
on
but
some
velvet
slippers
all
wet
and
muddy
with
the
dirty
streets
so
i
walked
up
to
her
as
if
i
had
been
her
servant
you
understand
and
put
her
into
a
carriage
and
stood
at
the
door
of
it
keeping
off
any
young
men
who
wished
to
get
in
for
she
was
such
a
pretty
young
thing
till
the
train
was
ready
to
start
and
then
i
got
into
the
nearest
carriage
there
was
to
her
well
tardif
i
said
impatiently
as
he
paused
looking
absently
into
the
dull
embers
of
the
seaweed
fire
i
turned
it
over
in
my
own
mind
then
he
continued
and
i
turned
it
over
in
my
own
mind
since
and
i
can
make
no
sort
of
an
account
of
it
a
young
lady
travelling
without
any
friends
in
a
dress
like
that
as
if
she
had
not
had
a
minute
to
spare
in
getting
ready
for
her
journey
it
was
a
bad
night
for
a
journey
too
could
she
be
going
to
see
some
friend
who
was
dying
at
every
station
i
looked
out
to
see
if
my
young
lady
left
the
train
but
no
not
even
at
southampton
was
she
going
on
to
france
must
look
out
for
her
at
the
i
said
to
myself
but
when
we
stopped
at
the
pier
i
did
not
want
her
to
think
i
was
watching
her
only
i
stood
well
in
the
light
that
she
might
see
me
when
she
looked
round
i
saw
her
stand
as
if
she
was
considering
and
i
moved
away
very
slowly
to
our
boat
to
give
her
the
chance
of
speaking
to
me
if
she
wished
but
she
only
followed
me
very
quietly
as
if
she
did
not
want
me
to
see
her
and
she
went
down
into
the
ladies
cabin
in
a
moment
out
of
sight
then
i
thought
is
running
away
from
some
one
or
from
something
she
had
no
shawls
or
umbrellas
or
baskets
such
as
ladies
are
always
cumbered
with
and
that
looked
strange
how
was
she
dressed
i
asked
she
wore
a
soft
jacket
he
answered
a
they
call
it
though
i
never
saw
a
seal
with
a
skin
like
that
and
a
hat
like
it
and
a
gown
and
her
little
muddy
velvet
slippers
it
was
a
strange
dress
for
travelling
was
it
doctor
very
strange
indeed
i
repeated
an
idea
was
buzzing
about
my
brain
that
i
had
heard
a
description
exactly
similar
before
but
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
recall
where
i
could
not
wait
to
hunt
it
out
then
for
tardif
was
in
a
full
flow
of
confidence
but
my
heart
yearned
to
her
he
said
more
than
ever
it
did
over
any
bird
fallen
from
its
nest
or
any
lamb
that
had
slipped
down
the
cliffs
all
the
softness
and
all
the
helplessness
of
every
poor
little
creature
i
had
ever
seen
in
my
life
seemed
about
her
all
the
hunted
creatures
and
all
the
trapped
creatures
came
to
my
mind
i
can
hardly
tell
you
about
it
doctor
i
could
have
risked
my
life
a
hundred
times
over
for
her
it
was
a
rough
night
and
i
kept
seeing
her
pale
face
before
me
though
there
was
not
half
the
danger
i
often
been
in
round
our
islands
i
could
keep
myself
from
fancying
we
were
all
going
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
that
poor
young
thing
running
away
from
one
trouble
was
going
to
meet
a
worse
if
it
is
worse
to
die
than
to
live
in
great
trouble
martin
they
tell
me
all
the
bed
of
the
sea
out
yonder
under
the
atlantic
is
a
smooth
smooth
floor
with
no
currents
or
tides
or
streams
but
a
great
calm
and
there
is
no
life
down
there
of
any
kind
well
that
night
i
seemed
to
see
the
dead
who
have
perished
by
sea
lying
there
calm
and
quiet
with
their
hands
folded
across
their
breasts
a
great
company
it
was
and
a
great
graveyard
strewed
over
with
sleeping
shapes
all
at
rest
and
quiet
waiting
till
they
hear
the
trumpet
of
the
archangel
sounding
so
that
even
the
dead
will
hear
and
live
again
it
was
a
solemn
sight
to
see
doctor
somehow
i
came
to
think
it
would
not
be
altogether
a
bad
thing
for
the
poor
young
troubled
creature
to
go
down
there
among
them
and
be
at
rest
there
are
some
people
who
seem
too
tender
and
delicate
for
this
world
yet
if
there
had
come
a
chance
i
have
laid
down
my
life
for
hers
even
then
when
i
knew
nothing
much
about
her
tardif
i
said
i
did
not
know
what
a
good
fellow
you
are
though
i
ought
to
have
known
it
by
this
time
no
he
answered
it
is
not
in
me
it
something
in
her
you
feel
something
of
it
yourself
doctor
or
how
could
you
stay
in
a
poor
little
house
like
this
thinking
of
nothing
but
her
and
not
caring
about
the
weather
keeping
you
away
from
home
but
let
me
go
on
in
the
morning
she
came
on
deck
and
talked
to
me
about
the
islands
and
where
she
could
live
cheaply
and
it
ended
in
her
coming
home
here
to
lodge
in
our
little
spare
room
there
was
another
curious
thing
she
had
not
any
luggage
with
her
not
a
box
nor
a
bag
of
any
kind
she
never
knew
that
i
knew
for
that
would
have
troubled
her
it
is
my
belief
that
she
has
run
away
but
who
can
she
have
run
away
from
tardif
i
asked
god
knows
he
answered
but
the
girl
has
suffered
you
can
see
that
by
her
face
whoever
or
whatever
she
has
run
away
from
her
cheeks
are
white
from
it
and
her
heart
sorrowful
i
know
nothing
of
her
secret
but
this
i
do
know
she
is
as
good
and
true
and
sweet
a
little
soul
as
my
poor
little
wife
was
she
has
been
here
all
winter
doctor
living
under
my
eye
and
i
waited
on
her
as
her
servant
though
a
rough
servant
i
am
for
one
like
her
she
has
tried
to
make
herself
cheerful
and
contented
with
our
poor
ways
see
she
mended
me
that
bit
of
net
those
are
her
meshes
though
her
pretty
white
fingers
were
made
sore
by
the
twine
she
would
mend
it
sitting
where
you
are
now
in
the
no
if
should
die
it
will
be
a
great
grief
of
heart
to
me
if
i
could
offer
my
life
to
god
in
place
of
hers
i
do
it
willingly
no
she
will
not
die
look
there
tardif
i
said
pointing
to
the
of
the
inner
room
a
white
card
had
been
slipped
under
the
door
noiselessly
a
signal
agreed
upon
between
mother
renouf
and
me
to
inform
me
that
my
patient
had
at
last
fallen
into
a
profound
slumber
which
seemed
likely
to
continue
some
hours
she
had
slept
perhaps
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
before
but
not
a
refreshing
wholesome
sleep
tardif
understood
the
silent
signal
as
well
as
i
did
and
a
more
solemn
expression
settled
on
his
face
after
a
while
he
put
away
his
pipe
and
stepping
barefoot
across
the
floor
without
a
sound
he
stopped
the
clock
and
brought
back
to
the
table
where
an
was
burning
a
large
old
bible
throughout
the
long
night
whenever
i
awoke
for
i
threw
myself
on
the
fern
bed
and
slept
fitfully
i
saw
his
handsome
face
with
its
rough
unkempt
hair
falling
across
his
forehead
as
it
was
bent
over
the
book
while
his
mouth
moved
silently
as
he
read
to
himself
chapter
after
chapter
and
turned
softly
the
pages
before
him
i
fell
into
a
heavy
slumber
just
before
daybreak
and
when
i
awoke
two
or
three
hours
after
i
found
that
the
house
had
been
put
in
order
just
as
usual
though
no
sound
had
disturbed
me
i
glanced
anxiously
at
the
closed
door
that
it
was
closed
and
the
white
card
still
on
the
sill
proved
to
me
that
our
charge
had
no
more
been
disturbed
than
myself
the
thought
struck
me
that
the
morning
light
would
shine
full
upon
the
weak
and
weary
eyelids
of
the
sleeper
but
upon
going
out
into
the
fold
to
look
at
her
casement
i
discovered
that
tardif
had
been
before
me
and
covered
it
with
an
old
sail
the
room
within
was
sufficiently
darkened
the
morning
was
more
than
half
gone
before
mother
renouf
opened
the
door
and
came
out
to
us
her
old
face
looking
more
haggard
than
ever
but
her
little
eyes
twinkling
with
satisfaction
she
gave
me
a
patronizing
nod
but
she
went
up
to
tardif
laid
a
hand
on
each
of
his
broad
shoulders
and
looked
him
keenly
in
the
face
all
goes
well
my
friend
she
said
significantly
your
little
does
not
think
of
going
to
the
good
god
yet
i
did
not
stay
to
watch
how
tardif
received
this
news
for
i
was
impatient
myself
to
see
how
she
was
going
on
thank
heaven
the
fever
was
gone
the
delirium
at
an
end
the
eyes
opening
languidly
as
my
fingers
touched
her
wrist
were
calm
and
intelligent
she
was
as
weak
as
a
kitten
but
that
did
not
trouble
me
much
i
was
sure
her
natural
health
was
good
and
she
would
soon
recover
her
lost
strength
i
had
to
stoop
down
to
hear
what
she
was
saying
have
i
kept
quite
still
doctor
she
asked
faintly
i
must
own
that
my
eyes
smarted
and
my
voice
was
not
to
be
trusted
i
had
never
felt
so
overjoyed
in
my
life
as
at
that
moment
but
what
a
singular
wish
to
be
obedient
possessed
this
girl
what
a
wonderful
power
of
submissive
she
had
cast
aside
authority
and
broken
away
from
it
as
she
had
done
apparently
there
must
have
been
some
great
provocation
before
a
nature
like
hers
could
venture
to
assert
its
own
independence
i
had
ample
time
for
turning
over
this
reflection
for
mother
renouf
was
worn
out
and
needed
rest
and
suzanne
tardif
was
of
little
use
in
the
i
scarcely
left
my
patient
all
that
day
for
the
rumor
i
had
set
afloat
the
day
before
was
sufficient
to
make
it
a
difficult
task
to
procure
another
nurse
the
almost
childish
face
grew
visibly
better
before
my
eyes
and
when
night
came
i
had
to
acknowledge
somewhat
reluctantly
that
as
soon
as
a
boat
could
leave
the
island
it
would
be
my
bounden
duty
to
return
to
guernsey
i
should
like
to
see
tardif
murmured
the
girl
to
me
that
night
after
she
had
awakened
from
a
second
long
and
peaceful
sleep
i
called
him
and
he
came
in
barefoot
his
broad
burly
frame
seeming
to
fill
up
all
the
little
room
she
could
not
lift
up
her
head
but
her
face
was
turned
toward
us
and
she
held
out
her
small
wasted
hand
to
him
smiling
faintly
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
he
took
it
into
his
great
horny
palm
and
looked
down
upon
it
as
he
held
it
very
carefully
with
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
why
it
is
like
an
he
said
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
for
getting
well
again
she
laughed
at
his
words
a
feeble
though
merry
laugh
like
a
child
and
she
seemed
delighted
with
the
sight
of
his
hearty
face
glowing
as
it
was
with
happiness
it
was
a
strange
chance
that
had
thrown
these
two
together
i
could
not
allow
tardif
to
remain
long
but
after
that
she
kept
devising
little
messages
to
send
to
him
through
me
whenever
i
was
about
to
leave
her
her
intercourse
with
mother
renouf
was
extremely
limited
as
the
old
woman
knowledge
of
english
was
slight
and
with
suzanne
she
could
hold
no
conversation
at
all
it
happened
in
consequence
that
i
was
the
only
person
who
could
talk
or
listen
to
her
through
the
long
and
dreary
hours
chapter
the
seventh
who
are
her
friends
at
another
time
i
might
have
recognized
the
danger
of
my
post
but
my
patient
had
become
so
and
her
mind
enfeebled
by
delirium
was
in
so
childish
a
condition
that
it
seemed
to
me
i
little
more
than
tending
some
young
girl
whose
age
was
far
below
my
own
i
did
not
trouble
myself
moreover
with
any
exact
introspection
there
was
an
of
satisfaction
and
happiness
running
through
the
hours
which
i
was
not
inclined
to
fathom
the
winds
continued
against
me
and
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
devote
myself
to
as
i
called
her
in
common
with
the
people
about
me
she
was
still
so
far
in
a
precarious
state
that
if
she
had
been
living
in
guernsey
it
would
have
been
my
duty
to
pay
to
her
unflagging
attention
but
upon
friday
afternoon
tardif
who
had
been
down
to
the
creux
harbor
brought
back
the
information
that
one
of
the
sark
cutters
was
about
to
venture
to
make
the
passage
across
the
channel
the
next
morning
to
attend
the
saturday
market
if
the
wind
did
not
rise
again
in
the
night
it
was
clear
as
day
what
i
must
do
i
must
bid
farewell
to
my
patient
however
reluctant
i
might
be
with
a
very
uncertain
prospect
of
seeing
her
again
a
patient
in
sark
could
not
have
many
visits
from
a
doctor
in
guernsey
she
was
recovering
with
the
wonderful
elasticity
of
a
thoroughly
sound
constitution
but
i
had
not
considered
it
advisable
for
her
even
to
sit
up
yet
with
her
broken
arm
and
sprained
ankle
i
took
my
seat
beside
her
for
the
last
time
her
fair
sweet
face
lying
upon
the
pillow
as
it
had
done
when
i
first
saw
it
only
the
look
of
suffering
was
gone
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
learn
something
of
the
mystery
that
surrounded
her
and
the
child
as
i
called
her
to
myself
was
so
submissive
to
me
that
she
would
answer
my
questions
readily
i
said
i
am
going
away
you
will
be
sorry
to
lose
me
very
very
sorry
she
answered
in
her
low
touching
voice
are
you
obliged
to
go
if
i
had
not
been
obliged
to
go
i
should
then
and
there
have
made
a
solemn
vow
to
remain
with
her
till
she
was
well
again
i
must
go
i
said
shaking
off
the
ridiculous
and
troublesome
idea
i
have
been
away
nearly
six
days
six
days
is
a
long
holiday
for
a
doctor
it
has
not
been
a
holiday
for
you
she
whispered
her
eyes
fastened
upon
mine
and
shining
like
clear
stars
well
i
repeated
i
must
go
before
i
go
i
wish
to
write
to
your
friends
for
you
you
will
not
be
strong
enough
to
write
yourself
for
some
days
and
it
is
quite
time
they
knew
what
danger
you
have
been
in
i
have
brought
a
pen
and
paper
and
i
will
post
the
letter
as
soon
as
i
reach
guernsey
a
faint
flush
colored
her
face
and
she
turned
her
eyes
away
from
me
why
do
you
think
i
ought
to
write
she
asked
at
length
because
you
have
been
very
near
death
i
answered
if
you
had
died
not
one
of
us
would
have
known
whom
to
communicate
with
unless
you
had
left
some
direction
in
that
box
of
yours
which
is
not
very
likely
no
she
said
you
would
find
nothing
there
i
suppose
if
i
had
died
nobody
would
ever
have
known
who
i
am
how
curious
that
would
have
been
was
she
amused
or
was
she
saddened
by
the
thought
i
could
not
tell
it
would
have
been
very
painful
to
tardif
and
to
me
i
said
it
must
be
very
painful
to
your
friends
whoever
they
are
not
to
know
what
has
become
of
you
give
me
permission
to
write
to
them
there
can
scarcely
be
reasons
sufficient
for
you
to
separate
yourself
from
them
like
this
besides
you
can
not
go
on
living
in
a
fisherman
cottage
you
were
not
born
to
it
how
do
you
know
she
asked
quickly
with
a
sharp
tone
in
her
voice
it
was
somewhat
difficult
to
answer
that
question
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
what
position
she
had
been
used
to
i
had
seen
no
token
of
wealth
about
her
room
which
was
as
homely
as
any
other
cottage
chamber
her
conversation
had
been
the
simple
childish
talk
of
an
invalid
recovering
from
a
serious
illness
and
had
scarcely
proved
her
to
be
an
educated
person
yet
there
was
something
in
her
face
and
tones
and
manner
which
as
plainly
to
tardif
as
to
me
stamped
this
runaway
girl
as
a
lady
let
me
write
to
your
friends
i
urged
waiving
the
question
it
is
not
fit
for
you
to
remain
here
i
beg
of
you
to
allow
me
to
communicate
with
them
her
face
quivered
like
a
child
when
it
is
partly
frightened
and
partly
grieved
i
have
no
friends
she
said
not
one
real
friend
in
the
world
an
almost
irresistible
inclination
assailed
me
to
fall
on
my
knees
beside
her
as
i
had
seen
tardif
do
and
take
a
solemn
oath
to
be
her
faithful
servant
and
friend
as
long
as
my
life
should
last
this
of
course
i
did
not
do
but
the
sound
of
the
words
so
plaintively
spoken
and
the
sight
of
her
quivering
face
rendered
her
a
hundredfold
more
interesting
to
me
i
said
taking
her
hand
in
mine
if
ever
you
should
need
a
friend
you
may
count
upon
martin
dobrée
as
one
as
true
as
any
you
could
wish
to
have
tardif
is
another
never
say
again
you
have
no
friends
thank
you
she
answered
simply
i
will
count
you
and
tardif
as
my
friends
but
i
have
no
others
so
you
need
not
write
to
anybody
but
what
if
you
had
died
i
persisted
you
would
have
buried
me
quietly
up
there
she
answered
in
the
pleasant
graveyard
where
the
birds
sing
all
day
long
and
i
should
have
been
forgotten
soon
am
i
likely
to
die
dr
martin
certainly
not
i
replied
hastily
nothing
of
the
kind
you
are
going
to
get
well
and
strong
again
but
i
must
bid
you
now
since
you
have
no
friends
to
write
to
can
i
do
any
thing
for
you
in
guernsey
i
can
send
you
any
thing
you
fancy
i
do
not
want
any
thing
she
said
you
want
a
great
number
of
things
i
said
medicines
of
course
what
is
the
good
of
a
doctor
who
sends
no
medicine
and
books
you
will
have
to
keep
yourself
quiet
a
long
time
you
would
like
some
books
oh
i
have
longed
for
books
she
said
sighing
but
do
buy
any
lend
me
some
of
your
own
mine
would
be
very
unsuitable
for
a
young
lady
i
answered
laughing
at
the
thought
of
my
private
library
may
i
ask
why
i
am
not
to
buy
any
because
i
have
no
money
to
spend
in
books
she
said
well
i
replied
i
will
borrow
some
for
you
from
the
ladies
i
know
we
will
not
waste
our
money
neither
you
nor
i
i
stood
looking
at
her
finding
it
harder
to
go
away
than
i
had
supposed
so
closely
had
i
watched
the
changes
upon
her
face
that
every
line
of
it
was
deeply
engraved
upon
my
memory
other
and
more
familiar
faces
seemed
to
have
faded
in
proportion
to
that
distinctness
of
impression
julia
features
for
instance
had
become
blurred
and
obscure
like
a
painting
which
has
lost
its
original
clearness
of
tone
how
soon
will
you
come
back
again
asked
the
faint
plaintive
voice
clearly
it
did
not
occur
to
her
that
i
could
not
pay
her
a
visit
without
great
difficulty
i
knew
how
it
was
next
to
an
impossibility
to
get
over
to
sark
for
some
time
at
least
but
i
felt
ready
to
combat
even
impossibilities
i
will
come
back
i
said
yes
i
promise
to
come
back
in
a
time
make
haste
and
get
well
before
then
now
i
was
going
to
sleep
at
vaudin
inn
near
to
creux
harbor
from
which
the
cutter
would
sail
almost
before
the
dawn
at
five
we
started
on
oar
passage
a
of
fishermen
bound
for
the
market
the
cold
was
sharp
for
it
was
still
early
in
march
and
the
easterly
wind
pierced
the
skin
like
a
myriad
of
fine
needles
a
waning
moon
was
hanging
in
the
sky
over
guernsey
and
the
east
was
growing
gray
with
the
coming
morning
by
the
time
the
sun
was
fairly
up
out
of
its
bed
of
clouds
we
had
rounded
the
southern
point
of
sark
and
were
in
sight
of
the
havre
gosselin
but
tardif
cottage
was
screened
by
the
cliffs
and
i
could
catch
no
glimpse
of
it
though
as
we
rowed
onward
i
saw
a
fine
thin
column
of
white
smoke
blown
toward
us
it
was
from
his
hearth
i
knew
and
at
this
moment
he
was
preparing
an
early
breakfast
for
my
invalid
i
watched
it
till
all
the
coast
became
an
indistinct
outline
against
the
sky
chapter
the
eighth
the
sixties
of
guernsey
i
was
more
than
with
cold
by
the
time
we
landed
at
the
quay
opposite
the
sark
office
the
place
was
all
alive
seeming
the
more
busy
and
animated
to
me
for
the
solitary
six
days
i
had
been
spending
since
last
sunday
the
arrival
of
our
boat
and
especially
my
appearance
in
it
created
quite
a
stir
among
the
loungers
who
are
always
hanging
about
the
pier
by
this
time
every
individual
in
knew
that
martin
dobrée
had
been
missing
for
several
days
having
gone
out
in
a
fisherman
boat
to
sark
the
sunday
before
i
had
seen
myself
in
the
glass
before
leaving
my
chamber
at
vaudin
and
to
some
extent
i
presented
the
haggard
appearance
of
a
shipwrecked
man
a
score
of
voices
greeted
me
some
welcoming
some
chaffing
glad
to
see
you
again
old
fellow
what
news
from
sark
been
in
quod
for
a
week
his
hair
is
not
cut
short
no
he
has
tarried
in
sark
till
his
beard
be
grown
there
was
a
circling
laugh
at
this
last
jest
at
my
appearance
which
had
been
uttered
by
a
jovial
clergyman
who
was
passing
by
on
his
way
to
the
town
church
i
did
my
best
to
laugh
and
banter
in
return
but
it
was
like
a
bear
dancing
with
a
sore
head
i
felt
gloomy
and
uncomfortable
a
change
had
come
over
me
since
i
left
home
for
my
return
was
by
no
means
an
unmixed
pleasure
as
i
was
proceeding
along
the
quay
with
a
train
of
sympathizing
attendants
a
man
who
was
driving
a
large
cart
piled
with
packages
in
cases
as
if
they
had
come
in
from
england
by
the
steamer
touched
his
hat
to
me
and
stopped
the
horse
it
was
in
order
to
inform
me
that
he
was
conveying
furniture
which
we
that
is
julia
and
i
had
ordered
up
to
our
new
house
the
windows
of
which
i
could
see
glistening
in
the
morning
sun
my
spirits
did
not
rise
even
at
this
cheerful
information
i
looked
coldly
at
the
cases
bade
the
man
go
on
and
shook
off
my
train
by
taking
an
abrupt
turn
up
a
flight
of
steps
leading
directly
into
the
haute
rue
i
had
chosen
instinctively
the
nearest
homeward
but
once
in
the
haute
rue
i
did
not
pursue
it
i
turned
again
upon
a
sudden
thought
toward
the
market
square
to
see
if
i
could
pick
up
any
dainties
to
tempt
the
delicate
appetite
of
my
sark
patient
every
step
i
took
brought
me
into
contact
with
some
friend
or
acquaintance
whom
i
would
have
avoided
gladly
the
market
was
sure
to
be
full
of
them
for
the
ladies
of
guernsey
like
frenchwomen
would
be
there
in
shoals
with
their
maidservants
behind
them
to
carry
their
purchases
yet
i
turned
toward
it
as
i
said
braving
both
congratulations
and
curiosity
to
see
what
i
could
buy
for
tardif
the
square
had
all
the
peculiar
animation
of
an
early
market
where
ladies
do
their
own
bargaining
as
i
had
known
beforehand
most
of
my
acquaintances
were
there
for
in
guernsey
the
feminine
element
predominates
terribly
and
most
of
my
acquaintances
were
ladies
the
behind
the
stalls
also
knew
me
most
of
them
nodded
to
me
as
i
strolled
slowly
through
the
crowd
but
they
were
much
too
busy
to
suspend
their
purchases
in
order
to
catechise
me
just
then
being
sure
of
me
at
a
future
time
i
had
not
done
badly
in
choosing
the
busiest
street
for
my
way
home
but
as
i
left
the
market
square
i
came
suddenly
upon
julia
face
to
face
it
had
all
the
effect
of
a
shock
upon
me
like
many
other
women
she
seldom
looked
well
the
prevailing
fashion
never
suited
her
however
the
bonnets
were
worn
whether
hanging
down
the
neck
or
slouched
over
the
forehead
rising
toward
the
sky
or
lying
like
a
flat
plate
on
the
crown
julia
bonnet
always
looked
as
if
it
had
been
made
for
somebody
else
she
was
fond
of
wearing
a
shawl
which
hung
ungracefully
about
her
and
made
her
figure
look
squarer
and
her
shoulders
higher
than
they
really
were
her
face
struck
sharply
upon
my
brain
as
if
i
had
never
seen
it
distinctly
before
not
a
bad
face
but
unmistakably
plain
and
just
now
with
a
frown
upon
it
and
her
heavy
eyebrows
knitted
forbiddingly
a
pretty
little
basket
was
in
her
hand
and
her
mind
was
full
of
the
bargains
she
was
bent
upon
she
was
even
more
surprised
and
startled
by
our
encounter
than
i
was
and
her
manner
when
taken
by
surprise
was
apt
to
be
abrupt
why
martin
she
ejaculated
well
julia
i
said
we
stood
looking
at
one
another
much
in
the
same
way
as
we
used
to
do
years
before
when
she
had
detected
me
in
some
boyish
prank
and
assumed
the
mentor
while
i
felt
a
culprit
how
really
i
felt
a
culprit
at
that
moment
she
could
not
guess
i
told
you
just
how
it
would
be
she
said
in
her
mentor
voice
i
knew
there
was
a
storm
coming
and
i
begged
and
entreated
of
you
not
to
go
your
mother
has
been
ill
all
the
week
and
your
father
has
been
as
cross
as
as
as
two
sticks
i
suggested
precisely
as
i
might
have
done
when
i
was
thirteen
it
is
nothing
to
laugh
at
said
julia
severely
i
shall
say
nothing
about
myself
and
my
own
feelings
though
they
have
been
most
acute
the
wind
blowing
a
hurricane
for
hours
together
and
we
not
sure
that
you
had
even
reached
sark
in
safety
your
mother
and
i
wanted
to
charter
the
rescue
and
send
her
over
to
fetch
you
home
as
soon
as
the
worst
of
the
storm
was
over
but
my
uncle
it
i
am
very
glad
he
did
i
replied
involuntarily
he
said
you
would
be
more
than
ready
to
come
back
in
the
first
cutter
that
sailed
she
went
on
i
suppose
you
have
just
come
in
yes
i
said
and
i
half
numbed
with
cold
and
nearly
famished
with
hunger
you
do
give
me
as
good
a
welcome
as
the
prodigal
son
got
julia
no
she
answered
softening
a
little
but
i
not
sorry
to
see
you
safe
again
i
would
turn
back
with
you
but
i
like
to
do
the
marketing
myself
for
the
servants
will
buy
any
thing
martin
a
whole
cartload
of
our
furniture
is
come
in
you
will
find
the
invoice
inside
my
davenport
we
must
go
down
this
afternoon
and
superintend
the
unpacking
very
well
i
said
but
i
can
not
stay
longer
now
i
did
not
go
on
with
any
lighter
heart
than
before
this
meeting
with
julia
i
had
scrutinized
her
face
voice
and
manner
with
unwonted
criticism
as
a
rule
a
face
that
has
been
before
us
all
our
days
is
as
seldom
an
object
of
criticism
as
any
family
portrait
which
has
hung
against
the
same
place
on
the
wall
all
our
lifetime
the
latter
fills
up
a
space
which
would
otherwise
be
blank
the
former
does
very
little
else
it
never
strikes
you
it
is
almost
invisible
to
you
there
would
be
a
blank
space
left
if
it
disappeared
and
you
could
not
fill
it
up
from
memory
a
phantom
has
been
living
breathing
moving
beside
you
with
vanishing
features
and
no
very
real
presence
i
had
therefore
for
the
first
time
criticised
my
future
wife
it
was
a
good
honest
plain
sensible
face
with
some
fine
insidious
lines
about
the
corners
of
the
eyes
and
lips
and
across
the
forehead
they
could
hardly
be
called
wrinkles
yet
but
they
were
the
first
faint
sketch
of
them
and
it
is
impossible
to
obliterate
the
slightest
touch
etched
by
time
she
was
five
years
older
than
i
last
birthday
there
was
no
more
chance
for
our
guernsey
girls
to
conceal
their
age
than
for
the
unhappy
daughters
of
peers
whose
dates
are
faithfully
kept
and
recorded
in
the
peerage
the
upper
classes
of
the
island
who
were
linked
together
by
endless
and
intricate
ramifications
of
relationship
formed
a
kind
of
large
family
with
some
of
its
advantages
and
many
of
its
drawbacks
in
one
sense
we
had
many
things
in
common
our
family
histories
were
public
property
as
also
our
private
characters
and
circumstances
for
instance
my
own
engagement
to
julia
and
our
approaching
marriage
gave
almost
as
much
interest
to
the
island
as
though
we
were
members
of
each
household
i
have
looked
out
a
passage
in
the
standard
work
upon
the
channel
islands
they
are
the
words
of
an
englishman
who
was
studying
us
more
philosophically
than
we
imagined
unknown
to
ourselves
we
had
been
under
his
microscope
at
a
period
not
very
distant
society
in
guernsey
grouped
itself
into
two
divisions
one
including
those
families
who
prided
themselves
on
ancient
descent
and
landed
estates
and
who
regarded
themselves
as
the
and
the
other
those
whose
fortunes
had
chiefly
been
made
during
the
late
war
or
in
trade
the
former
were
called
the
latter
were
the
now
julia
and
i
belonged
emphatically
to
the
sixties
we
had
never
been
debased
by
trade
and
a
was
not
known
in
our
family
to
be
sure
my
father
had
lost
a
fortune
instead
of
making
one
in
any
way
but
that
did
not
alter
his
position
or
mine
we
belonged
to
the
aristocracy
of
guernsey
and
as
for
my
marriage
with
julia
it
was
so
much
the
more
interesting
as
the
number
of
marriageable
men
was
extremely
limited
and
she
was
considered
favored
indeed
by
fate
which
had
provided
for
her
a
cousin
willing
to
settle
down
for
life
in
the
island
still
more
greetings
more
inquiries
more
jokes
as
i
wended
my
way
homeward
i
had
become
very
weary
of
them
before
i
turned
into
our
own
drive
my
father
was
just
starting
off
on
horseback
he
looked
exceedingly
well
on
horseback
being
a
very
handsome
man
and
in
excellent
preservation
his
hair
as
white
as
snow
was
thick
and
well
curled
and
his
face
almost
without
a
wrinkle
he
had
married
young
and
was
not
more
than
years
older
than
myself
he
stopped
and
extended
two
fingers
to
me
so
you
are
back
martin
he
said
it
has
been
a
confounded
nuisance
you
being
out
of
the
way
and
such
weather
for
a
man
of
my
years
i
had
to
ride
out
three
miles
to
lance
a
baby
gums
confound
it
in
all
that
storm
on
tuesday
durande
has
been
very
ill
too
all
your
patients
have
been
troublesome
but
it
must
have
been
awfully
dull
work
for
you
out
yonder
what
did
you
do
with
yourself
eh
make
love
to
some
of
the
pretty
sark
girls
behind
julia
back
eh
my
father
kept
himself
young
as
he
was
very
fond
of
stating
his
style
of
conversation
was
eminently
so
it
jarred
upon
my
ears
more
than
ever
after
tardif
grave
and
solemn
words
and
often
deep
thoughts
i
was
on
the
point
of
answering
sharply
but
i
checked
myself
the
weather
has
been
awful
i
said
how
did
my
mother
bear
it
she
has
been
like
an
old
hen
clucking
after
her
duckling
in
the
water
he
replied
she
has
been
fretting
and
fuming
after
you
all
the
week
if
it
had
been
me
out
in
sark
she
would
have
slept
soundly
and
ate
heartily
as
it
was
you
she
has
neither
slept
nor
ate
you
are
quite
an
old
woman
pet
martin
as
for
me
there
is
no
love
lost
between
old
women
and
me
sir
i
said
turning
away
and
hurrying
on
to
the
house
i
heard
him
laugh
lightly
and
hum
an
as
he
rode
off
sitting
his
horse
with
the
easy
seat
of
a
thorough
horseman
he
would
never
set
up
a
carriage
as
long
as
he
could
ride
like
that
i
watched
him
out
of
sight
and
then
went
in
to
seek
my
poor
mother
chapter
the
ninth
a
clew
to
the
secret
she
was
lying
on
the
sofa
in
the
with
the
venetian
blinds
down
to
darken
the
morning
sunshine
her
eyes
wore
closed
though
she
held
in
her
hands
the
from
which
she
had
been
reading
as
usual
the
psalms
for
the
day
i
had
time
to
take
note
of
the
extreme
fragility
of
her
appearance
which
doubtless
i
noticed
the
more
plainly
for
my
short
absence
her
hands
were
very
thin
and
her
cheeks
hollow
a
few
silver
threads
were
growing
among
her
brown
hair
and
a
line
or
two
between
her
eyebrows
were
becoming
deeper
but
while
i
was
looking
at
her
though
i
made
no
sort
of
sound
or
movement
she
seemed
to
feel
that
i
was
there
and
after
looking
up
she
started
from
her
sofa
and
flung
her
arms
about
me
pressing
closer
and
closer
to
me
o
martin
my
boy
my
darling
she
sobbed
thank
god
you
are
come
back
safe
oh
i
have
been
very
rebellious
very
unbelieving
i
ought
to
have
known
that
you
would
be
safe
oh
i
am
thankful
so
am
i
mother
i
said
kissing
her
and
very
hungry
into
the
bargain
i
knew
that
would
check
her
hysterical
excitement
she
looked
up
at
me
with
smiles
and
tears
on
her
face
but
the
smiles
won
the
day
that
is
so
like
you
martin
she
said
i
believe
your
ghost
would
say
those
very
words
you
are
always
hungry
when
you
come
home
well
my
boy
shall
have
the
best
breakfast
in
guernsey
sit
down
then
and
let
me
wait
upon
you
that
was
just
what
pleased
her
most
whenever
i
came
in
from
some
ride
into
the
country
she
was
a
woman
with
fondling
caressing
little
ways
such
as
julia
could
no
more
perform
gracefully
than
an
elephant
could
waltz
my
mother
enjoyed
fetching
my
slippers
and
warming
them
herself
by
the
fire
and
carrying
away
my
boots
when
i
took
them
off
no
servant
was
permitted
to
do
any
of
these
little
offices
for
me
that
is
when
my
father
was
out
of
the
way
if
he
was
there
my
mother
sat
still
and
left
me
to
wait
on
myself
or
ring
for
a
servant
never
in
my
recollection
had
she
done
any
thing
of
the
kind
for
my
father
had
she
watched
and
waited
upon
him
thus
in
the
early
days
of
their
married
life
until
some
neglect
or
unfaithfulness
of
his
had
cooled
her
love
for
him
i
sat
down
as
she
bade
me
and
had
my
slippers
brought
and
felt
her
fingers
passed
fondly
through
my
hair
you
have
come
back
like
a
barbarian
she
said
rougher
than
tardif
himself
how
have
you
managed
my
boy
you
must
tell
me
all
about
it
as
soon
as
your
hunger
is
satisfied
as
soon
as
i
have
had
my
breakfast
mother
i
must
put
up
a
few
things
in
a
hamper
to
go
back
by
the
sark
cutter
i
answered
what
sort
of
things
she
asked
tell
me
and
i
will
be
getting
them
ready
for
you
well
there
will
be
some
physic
of
course
i
said
you
can
not
help
me
in
that
but
you
can
find
things
suitable
for
a
delicate
appetite
jelly
you
know
and
jams
and
marmalade
any
thing
nice
that
comes
to
hand
and
some
good
and
a
few
amusing
books
books
echoed
my
mother
i
recollected
at
once
that
the
books
she
might
select
as
being
suited
to
a
sark
peasant
would
hardly
prove
interesting
to
my
patient
i
could
not
do
better
than
go
down
to
barbet
circulating
library
and
look
out
some
good
works
there
well
no
i
said
never
mind
the
books
if
you
will
look
out
the
other
things
those
can
wait
whom
are
they
for
asked
my
mother
for
my
patient
i
replied
devoting
myself
to
the
breakfast
before
me
what
sort
of
a
patient
martin
she
inquired
again
her
name
is
ollivier
i
said
a
common
name
our
postmaster
name
is
ollivier
oh
yes
she
answered
i
know
several
families
of
olliviers
i
dare
say
i
should
know
this
person
if
you
could
tell
me
her
christian
name
is
it
jane
or
martha
or
rachel
i
do
know
i
said
i
did
not
ask
should
i
tell
my
mother
about
my
mysterious
patient
i
hesitated
for
a
minute
or
two
but
to
what
good
it
was
not
my
habit
to
talk
about
my
patients
and
their
ailments
i
left
them
all
behind
me
when
i
crossed
the
threshold
of
home
my
mother
brief
curiosity
had
been
satisfied
with
the
name
of
ollivier
and
she
made
no
further
inquiries
about
her
but
to
expedite
me
in
my
purpose
she
rang
and
gave
orders
for
old
pellet
our
only
to
find
a
strong
hamper
and
told
the
cook
to
look
out
some
jars
of
preserve
the
packing
of
that
hamper
interested
me
wonderfully
and
my
mother
rather
amazed
at
my
taking
the
superintendence
of
it
in
person
stood
by
me
in
her
letting
me
help
myself
liberally
there
was
a
good
space
left
after
i
had
taken
sufficient
to
supply
miss
ollivier
with
good
things
for
some
weeks
to
come
if
my
mother
had
not
been
by
i
should
have
filled
it
up
with
books
give
me
a
loaf
or
two
of
white
bread
i
said
the
bread
at
is
coarse
and
hard
as
i
know
after
eating
it
for
a
week
a
loaf
if
you
please
dear
mother
whatever
are
you
doing
here
martin
exclaimed
julia
unwelcome
voice
behind
me
her
bilious
attack
had
not
quite
passed
away
and
her
tones
were
somewhat
sharp
and
raspy
he
has
been
living
on
tardif
coarse
fare
for
a
week
answered
my
mother
so
now
he
has
compassion
enough
for
his
sark
patient
to
pack
up
some
dainties
for
her
if
you
could
only
give
him
one
or
two
of
your
bad
headaches
he
would
have
more
sympathy
for
you
have
you
had
one
of
your
headaches
julia
i
inquired
the
worst
i
ever
had
she
answered
it
was
partly
your
going
off
in
that
rash
way
and
the
storm
that
came
on
after
and
the
fright
we
were
in
you
must
not
think
of
going
again
martin
i
shall
take
care
you
do
go
after
we
are
married
julia
had
been
used
to
speak
out
as
calmly
about
our
marriage
as
if
it
was
no
more
than
going
to
a
picnic
it
grated
upon
me
just
then
though
it
had
been
much
the
same
with
myself
there
was
no
delightful
agitation
about
the
future
that
lay
before
us
we
were
going
to
set
up
housekeeping
by
ourselves
and
that
was
all
there
was
no
mystery
in
it
no
problem
to
be
solved
no
discovery
to
be
made
on
either
side
there
would
be
no
blue
beard
chamber
in
our
dwelling
we
had
grown
up
together
now
we
had
agreed
to
grow
old
together
that
was
the
sum
total
of
marriage
to
julia
and
me
i
finished
packing
the
hamper
and
sent
pellet
with
it
to
the
sark
office
having
addressed
it
to
tardif
who
had
engaged
to
be
down
at
the
creux
harbor
to
receive
it
when
the
cutter
returned
then
i
made
a
short
and
hurried
toilet
which
by
this
time
had
become
essential
to
my
reappearance
in
civilized
society
but
i
was
in
haste
to
secure
a
parcel
of
books
before
the
cutter
should
start
home
again
with
its
courageous
little
knot
of
i
ran
down
to
barbet
scarcely
heeding
the
greetings
which
were
flung
after
mo
by
every
i
looked
through
the
with
growing
dissatisfaction
until
i
hit
upon
two
of
gaskell
novels
pride
and
prejudice
by
jane
austin
and
david
copperfield
besides
these
i
chose
a
book
for
sunday
reading
as
my
observations
upon
my
mother
and
julia
had
taught
me
that
my
patient
could
not
read
a
novel
on
a
sunday
with
a
quiet
conscience
barbet
brought
half
a
sheet
of
an
old
to
form
the
first
cover
of
my
parcel
the
shop
was
crowded
with
and
as
he
was
busy
i
undertook
to
pack
them
myself
the
more
willingly
as
i
had
no
wish
for
him
to
know
what
direction
i
wrote
upon
them
i
was
about
to
fold
the
newspaper
round
them
when
my
eye
was
caught
by
an
advertisement
at
the
top
of
one
of
the
columns
the
first
line
of
which
was
printed
in
capitals
i
recollected
in
an
instant
that
i
had
seen
it
and
read
it
before
this
was
what
i
had
tried
in
vain
to
recall
while
tardif
was
describing
miss
ollivier
to
me
strayed
from
her
home
in
london
on
the
a
young
lady
with
hair
gray
eyes
and
delicate
features
age
twenty
one
she
is
believed
to
have
been
alone
was
dressed
in
a
dress
and
jacket
and
hat
fifty
pounds
reward
is
offered
to
any
person
giving
such
information
as
will
lead
to
her
restoration
to
her
friends
apply
to
scott
and
brown
inn
road
i
stood
perfectly
still
for
some
seconds
staring
blankly
at
the
very
simple
direct
advertisement
under
my
eyes
there
was
not
the
slightest
doubt
in
my
mind
that
it
had
a
direct
reference
to
my
pretty
patient
in
sark
i
had
a
reason
for
recollecting
the
date
of
tardif
return
from
london
the
very
day
after
the
mournful
disaster
off
the
havre
gosselin
when
four
gentlemen
and
a
boatman
had
been
lost
during
a
squall
but
i
had
no
time
for
deliberation
then
and
i
tore
off
a
large
corner
of
the
containing
that
and
other
advertisements
and
thrust
it
unseen
into
my
pocket
after
that
i
went
on
with
my
work
and
succeeded
in
turning
out
a
parcel
which
i
carried
down
to
the
sark
cutter
before
i
returned
home
i
made
two
or
three
calls
upon
patients
whom
my
father
had
visited
during
my
absence
everywhere
i
had
to
submit
to
numerous
questions
as
to
my
adventures
and
pursuits
during
my
week
exile
at
each
place
curiosity
seemed
to
be
quite
satisfied
with
the
information
that
the
young
woman
who
had
been
hurt
by
a
fall
from
the
cliffs
was
an
ollivier
with
that
freedom
and
familiarity
which
exists
among
us
i
was
rallied
for
my
evident
absence
and
preoccupation
of
mind
which
were
pleasantly
ascribed
to
the
fact
that
a
large
quantity
of
furniture
for
our
new
house
had
arrived
from
england
while
i
was
away
these
friends
of
mine
could
tell
me
the
colors
of
the
curtains
and
the
patterns
of
the
carpets
and
the
style
of
my
chairs
and
tables
so
engrossingly
interesting
to
all
our
circle
was
our
approaching
marriage
in
the
mean
time
i
had
no
leisure
to
study
and
ponder
over
the
advertisement
which
by
so
odd
a
chance
had
come
into
my
hands
that
must
be
reserved
till
i
was
alone
at
night
chapter
the
tenth
julia
yet
i
found
my
attention
wandering
and
my
wits
even
in
the
afternoon
when
i
had
gone
down
with
julia
and
my
mother
to
the
new
house
to
see
after
the
unpacking
of
that
load
of
furniture
i
can
imagine
circumstances
in
which
nothing
could
be
more
delightful
than
the
care
with
which
a
man
prepares
a
home
for
his
future
wife
the
very
tint
of
the
walls
and
the
way
the
light
falls
in
through
the
windows
would
become
matters
of
grave
importance
in
what
pleasant
spot
shall
her
favorite
chair
be
placed
and
what
picture
shall
hang
opposite
it
to
catch
her
eye
the
oftenest
where
is
her
piano
to
stand
what
china
and
glass
and
silver
is
she
to
use
where
are
the
softest
carpets
to
be
found
for
her
feet
to
tread
in
short
where
is
the
very
best
and
daintiest
of
every
thing
to
be
had
for
the
best
and
daintiest
little
bride
the
sun
ever
shone
on
there
was
not
the
slightest
flavor
of
this
sentiment
in
our
furnishing
of
our
new
house
it
was
really
more
julia
business
than
mine
we
had
had
dozens
of
furnishing
lists
to
peruse
from
the
principal
houses
in
london
and
paris
as
if
even
there
it
was
a
thing
that
julia
and
i
were
going
to
be
married
we
had
toiled
through
these
catalogues
making
in
them
as
though
they
were
catalogues
of
an
art
exhibition
we
had
prudently
settled
the
precise
sum
of
julia
money
which
we
were
to
lay
out
julia
taste
did
not
often
agree
with
mine
as
she
had
no
eye
for
the
harmonies
of
color
a
singular
deficiency
among
us
as
most
of
the
guernsey
women
are
born
artists
we
were
constantly
compelled
to
come
to
a
compromise
each
yielding
some
point
not
without
a
secret
misgiving
on
my
part
that
the
new
house
would
have
many
an
eyesore
about
it
for
me
but
then
it
was
julia
money
that
was
doing
it
and
after
all
she
was
more
anxious
to
please
me
than
i
deserved
that
afternoon
pellet
and
i
like
two
assistants
in
a
unrolled
carpets
and
stretched
them
along
the
floors
before
the
critical
gaze
of
my
mother
and
julia
we
unpacked
chairs
and
tables
scanning
anxiously
for
damages
on
the
polished
wood
and
setting
them
one
after
another
in
a
row
against
the
walls
i
went
about
as
in
some
dream
the
house
commanded
a
splendid
view
of
the
whole
group
of
the
channel
islands
and
the
rocky
islets
innumerable
strewed
about
the
sea
the
afternoon
sun
was
shining
full
upon
sark
and
whenever
i
looked
through
the
window
i
could
see
the
cliffs
of
the
havre
gosselin
purple
in
the
distance
with
a
silver
thread
of
foam
at
their
foot
no
wonder
that
my
thoughts
wandered
and
the
words
my
mother
and
julia
were
speaking
went
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
other
certainly
i
was
dreaming
but
which
part
was
the
dream
i
do
believe
he
cares
a
straw
about
the
carpets
exclaimed
julia
in
a
disappointed
tone
i
do
indeed
dear
julia
i
said
bringing
myself
back
to
the
carpets
here
i
had
been
obliged
to
give
in
to
julia
taste
she
had
set
her
mind
upon
having
flowers
in
her
carpet
and
there
they
were
large
garlands
of
blossoms
very
gay
and
as
i
ventured
to
remark
to
myself
very
gaudy
you
like
it
better
than
you
did
in
the
pattern
she
asked
anxiously
i
did
not
like
it
one
whit
better
but
i
should
have
been
a
brute
if
i
had
said
so
she
was
gazing
at
it
and
me
with
so
troubled
an
expression
that
i
felt
it
necessary
to
set
her
mind
at
ease
it
is
certainly
handsomer
than
the
pattern
i
said
regarding
it
attentively
very
much
handsomer
you
like
it
better
than
the
plain
thing
you
chose
at
first
pursued
julia
i
was
about
to
be
hunted
into
a
corner
and
forced
into
denying
my
own
taste
a
process
almost
more
painful
than
denying
one
faith
when
my
mother
came
to
my
rescue
she
could
read
us
both
as
an
open
book
and
knew
the
precise
moment
to
come
between
us
julia
my
love
she
said
remember
that
we
wish
to
show
martin
those
patterns
while
it
is
daylight
is
sunday
you
know
a
little
tinge
of
color
crept
over
julia
tintless
face
as
she
told
pellet
he
might
go
i
almost
wished
that
i
might
be
dismissed
too
but
it
was
only
a
vague
wordless
wish
we
then
drew
near
to
the
window
from
which
we
could
see
sark
so
clearly
and
julia
drew
out
of
her
pocket
a
very
large
envelope
which
was
bursting
with
its
contents
they
were
small
scraps
of
white
silk
and
white
satin
i
took
them
mechanically
into
my
hand
and
could
not
help
admiring
the
pure
lustrous
glossy
beauty
of
them
i
passed
my
fingers
over
them
softly
there
was
something
in
the
sight
of
them
that
moved
me
as
if
they
were
fragments
of
the
shining
garments
of
some
vision
which
in
times
gone
by
when
i
was
much
younger
had
now
and
then
floated
before
my
fancy
i
did
not
know
any
one
lovely
enough
to
wear
raiment
of
glistening
white
like
these
unless
unless
a
passing
glimpse
of
the
pure
white
face
and
glossy
hair
and
deep
gray
eyes
of
my
sark
patient
flashed
across
me
they
are
patterns
for
julia
said
my
mother
in
a
low
tender
voice
chapter
the
eleventh
true
to
both
for
julia
i
repeated
the
treacherous
vision
fading
away
instantaneously
oh
yes
i
understand
they
are
very
beautiful
very
beautiful
indeed
which
do
you
like
most
asked
julia
in
a
whisper
as
she
leaned
against
my
shoulder
i
like
them
all
i
said
there
is
scarcely
any
difference
among
them
that
i
can
see
no
difference
she
exclaimed
that
is
so
like
a
man
why
they
are
as
different
as
can
be
look
here
this
one
is
only
five
shillings
a
yard
and
that
is
twelve
is
that
a
difference
a
very
great
one
i
replied
but
do
you
think
you
will
look
well
in
white
my
dear
julia
you
never
do
wear
white
a
bride
can
not
wear
any
thing
but
white
she
said
angrily
i
declare
martin
you
would
not
mind
if
i
looked
a
perfect
fright
but
i
should
mind
very
much
i
urged
putting
my
arm
around
her
for
you
will
be
my
wife
then
julia
she
smiled
almost
for
the
first
time
that
afternoon
for
her
mind
had
been
full
of
the
furniture
and
too
burdened
for
happiness
but
now
she
looked
happy
you
can
be
as
nice
and
good
as
any
one
when
you
like
she
said
gently
i
shall
always
be
nice
and
good
when
we
are
married
i
answered
with
a
laugh
you
are
not
afraid
of
venturing
are
you
julia
not
the
least
in
the
world
she
said
i
know
you
martin
and
i
can
trust
you
implicitly
my
heart
ached
at
the
words
so
softly
and
warmly
spoken
but
i
laughed
again
at
myself
this
time
not
at
her
why
should
she
not
trust
me
i
would
be
as
true
as
steel
to
her
i
loved
no
one
better
and
i
would
take
care
not
to
love
any
one
my
word
my
honor
my
troth
were
all
plighted
to
her
only
a
scoundrel
and
a
fool
would
be
unfaithful
to
an
engagement
like
ours
we
walked
home
together
we
three
all
contented
and
all
happy
we
had
a
good
deal
to
talk
of
during
the
evening
and
sat
up
late
sundry
small
events
had
happened
in
guernsey
during
my
absence
and
these
were
discussed
with
that
charming
minuteness
with
which
women
canvass
family
matters
it
was
midnight
before
i
found
myself
alone
in
my
own
room
i
had
half
forgotten
the
crumpled
paper
in
my
but
now
i
smoothed
it
out
before
me
and
pondered
over
every
word
no
there
could
not
be
a
doubt
that
it
referred
to
miss
ollivier
hair
gray
eyes
and
delicate
features
that
exactly
corresponded
with
her
appearance
dress
and
jacket
and
hat
it
was
precisely
the
dress
which
tardif
had
described
fifty
pounds
reward
that
was
a
large
sum
to
offer
and
the
inference
was
that
her
friends
were
persons
of
good
means
and
anxious
for
her
recovery
why
should
she
have
strayed
from
home
that
was
the
question
what
possible
reason
could
there
have
been
strong
enough
to
impel
a
young
and
girl
to
run
all
the
risks
and
dangers
of
a
flight
alone
and
unprotected
her
friends
evidently
believed
that
she
had
not
been
run
away
with
there
was
not
the
ordinary
element
of
an
elopement
in
this
case
but
miss
ollivier
had
assured
me
she
had
no
friends
what
did
she
mean
by
the
word
here
were
persons
evidently
anxious
to
discover
her
place
of
concealment
were
they
friends
or
could
they
by
any
chance
be
enemies
this
is
not
an
age
when
enmity
is
very
rampant
for
my
own
part
i
had
not
an
enemy
in
the
world
why
should
this
pretty
girl
have
any
most
probably
it
was
one
of
those
instances
of
bitter
misunderstanding
which
sometimes
arise
in
families
and
which
had
driven
her
to
the
desperate
step
of
seeking
peace
and
quietness
by
flight
then
what
ought
i
to
do
with
this
advertisement
thrust
as
it
would
seem
purposely
under
my
notice
if
i
had
not
wrapped
up
the
parcel
myself
at
barbet
i
should
have
missed
seeing
it
or
if
barbet
had
picked
up
any
other
piece
of
paper
it
would
not
have
come
under
my
eye
a
curious
concatenation
of
very
trivial
circumstances
had
ended
in
putting
into
my
hands
a
clew
by
which
i
could
unravel
all
the
mystery
about
my
sark
patient
what
was
i
to
do
with
the
clew
i
might
communicate
at
once
with
scott
and
brown
giving
them
the
information
they
had
advertised
for
six
months
before
and
receive
a
reply
stating
that
it
was
no
longer
valuable
to
them
or
containing
an
acknowledgment
of
my
claim
to
the
fifty
pounds
reward
i
might
sell
my
knowledge
of
miss
ollivier
for
fifty
pounds
in
doing
so
i
might
render
her
a
great
service
by
restoring
her
to
her
proper
sphere
in
society
but
the
recollection
of
tardif
description
of
her
as
looking
terrified
and
hunted
recurred
vividly
to
me
the
advertisement
put
her
age
as
i
should
not
have
judged
her
so
old
myself
especially
since
her
hair
had
been
cut
short
but
if
she
was
she
was
old
enough
to
form
plans
and
purposes
for
herself
and
to
choose
as
far
as
she
could
her
own
mode
of
living
i
was
not
prepared
to
deliver
her
up
until
i
knew
something
more
of
both
sides
of
the
question
settled
that
if
i
could
see
scot
and
brown
and
learn
something
about
miss
ollivier
friends
i
might
be
then
able
to
decide
whether
i
would
betray
her
to
them
but
i
would
not
write
also
that
i
must
see
her
again
first
and
once
more
urge
her
to
have
confidence
in
me
if
she
would
trust
me
with
her
secret
i
would
be
as
true
to
her
as
a
friend
as
i
meant
to
be
true
to
julia
having
come
to
these
conclusions
i
cut
the
advertisement
carefully
out
of
the
crumpled
paper
and
placed
it
in
my
with
portraits
of
my
mother
and
julia
here
were
mementos
of
the
three
women
i
cared
most
for
in
the
world
my
mother
first
julia
second
and
my
mysterious
patient
third
chapter
the
twelfth
stolen
waters
are
sweet
i
was
neither
in
good
spirits
nor
in
good
temper
during
the
next
few
days
my
mother
and
julia
appeared
astonished
at
this
for
i
was
not
ordinarily
as
touchy
and
fractious
as
i
showed
myself
immediately
after
my
sojourn
in
sark
i
was
ashamed
of
it
myself
the
new
house
which
occupied
their
time
and
thoughts
so
agreeably
worried
me
as
it
had
not
done
before
i
made
every
possible
excuse
not
to
be
sent
to
it
or
taken
to
it
several
times
a
day
the
discussions
over
julia
also
which
had
by
no
means
been
decided
upon
on
saturday
afternoon
began
to
bore
me
beyond
words
whenever
i
could
i
made
my
patients
a
pretext
for
getting
away
from
them
one
of
them
a
cousin
of
my
mother
as
i
have
said
we
were
all
cousins
of
one
degree
or
another
captain
carey
met
me
on
the
quay
a
day
or
two
after
my
return
he
had
been
a
commander
in
the
royal
navy
and
after
cruising
about
in
all
manner
of
unhealthy
latitudes
had
returned
to
his
native
island
for
the
recovery
of
his
health
he
and
his
sister
lived
together
in
a
very
pleasant
house
of
their
own
in
the
vale
about
two
miles
from
he
looked
yellow
enough
to
be
on
the
verge
of
an
attack
of
jaundice
when
he
came
across
me
hallo
martin
he
cried
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
my
boy
i
been
a
little
out
of
sorts
lately
but
i
would
not
let
johanna
send
for
your
father
he
does
very
well
to
go
dawdling
after
women
and
playing
with
their
pulses
but
i
do
want
him
dawdling
after
me
tell
me
what
you
have
to
say
about
me
my
lad
he
went
on
to
tell
me
his
symptoms
while
a
sudden
idea
struck
me
almost
like
a
flash
of
genius
i
am
nothing
of
a
genius
but
at
that
time
new
thoughts
came
into
my
mind
with
wonderful
rapidity
it
was
positively
necessary
that
i
should
run
over
to
sark
this
week
i
had
given
my
word
to
miss
ollivier
that
i
would
do
so
but
i
dared
not
mention
such
a
project
at
home
my
mother
and
julia
would
be
up
in
arms
at
the
first
syllable
i
uttered
what
if
i
could
do
two
patients
good
at
one
stroke
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
captain
carey
had
a
pretty
little
yacht
lying
idle
in
sampson
harbor
and
a
day
cruising
would
do
him
all
the
good
in
the
world
why
should
he
not
carry
me
over
to
sark
when
i
could
visit
my
other
patient
and
nobody
be
made
miserable
by
the
trip
i
will
make
you
up
some
of
your
old
medicine
i
said
but
i
strongly
recommend
you
to
have
a
day
out
on
the
water
seven
or
eight
hours
at
any
rate
if
the
weather
keeps
as
fine
as
it
is
now
it
will
do
you
a
world
of
good
it
is
so
dreary
alone
he
objected
and
johanna
would
not
care
to
go
out
at
this
season
i
know
if
i
could
manage
it
i
said
deliberating
i
should
be
glad
to
have
a
day
with
you
ah
if
you
could
do
that
he
replied
eagerly
i
see
about
it
i
said
should
you
mind
where
you
sailed
to
not
at
all
not
at
all
my
boy
he
answered
so
that
i
get
your
company
you
shall
be
skipper
or
helmsman
or
both
if
you
like
well
then
i
replied
you
might
take
me
over
to
the
havre
gosselin
to
see
how
my
patient
broken
arm
is
going
on
it
a
bore
there
being
no
resident
medical
man
there
at
this
moment
the
accident
last
autumn
was
a
great
loss
to
the
island
ah
poor
fellow
said
captain
carey
he
was
a
sad
loss
to
them
but
i
take
you
over
with
pleasure
martin
any
day
you
fix
upon
get
the
yacht
then
i
said
i
think
i
can
manage
it
on
thursday
i
did
not
say
at
home
whither
i
was
bound
on
thursday
i
informed
them
merely
that
captain
carey
and
i
were
going
out
in
his
yacht
for
a
few
hours
this
was
simply
to
prevent
them
from
worrying
themselves
it
was
as
delicious
a
spring
morning
as
ever
i
remember
as
i
rode
along
the
flat
shore
between
and
sampson
the
fresh
air
from
the
sea
played
about
my
face
as
if
to
drive
dull
care
away
and
make
me
as
buoyant
and
debonair
as
itself
the
little
waves
were
glittering
and
dancing
in
the
sunshine
and
chiming
with
the
merry
carols
of
the
larks
outsinging
one
another
in
the
blue
sky
overhead
the
numerous
like
children
toys
which
were
pumping
water
out
of
the
whirled
and
spun
busily
in
the
brisk
breeze
every
person
i
met
saluted
me
with
a
blithe
and
cheery
greeting
my
dull
spirits
had
been
blown
far
away
before
i
set
foot
on
the
deck
of
captain
carey
little
yacht
the
run
over
was
all
that
we
could
wish
the
of
a
boat
belonging
to
the
yacht
bore
me
to
the
foot
of
the
ladder
hanging
down
the
rock
at
havre
gosselin
a
very
few
minutes
took
me
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
there
lay
the
little
thatched
home
of
my
patient
i
hastened
forward
eagerly
the
place
seemed
very
solitary
and
deserted
and
a
sudden
fear
came
across
me
was
it
possible
that
she
should
be
dead
it
was
possible
i
had
left
her
six
days
ago
only
just
over
a
terrible
crisis
there
might
have
been
a
relapse
a
failure
of
vital
force
i
might
be
come
to
find
those
shining
eyes
hid
beneath
their
lids
forever
and
the
pale
suffering
face
motionless
in
death
certainly
the
rhythmic
motion
of
my
heart
was
disturbed
i
felt
it
contract
painfully
and
its
beating
suspended
for
a
moment
or
two
the
farmstead
was
intensely
quiet
with
the
ominous
stillness
of
death
all
the
windows
were
shrouded
with
their
check
curtains
there
was
no
clatter
of
suzanne
wooden
clogs
about
the
fold
or
the
kitchen
if
it
had
been
sunday
this
supernatural
silence
would
have
been
easily
accounted
for
but
it
was
thursday
i
scarcely
dared
go
on
and
learn
the
cause
of
it
all
silent
still
as
i
crossed
the
stony
causeway
of
the
yard
not
a
face
looked
out
from
door
or
window
casement
stood
a
little
way
open
and
the
breeze
played
with
the
curtains
fluttering
them
like
banners
in
a
procession
i
dared
not
try
to
look
in
the
was
ajar
and
i
approached
it
cautiously
thank
god
i
cried
within
myself
as
i
gazed
eagerly
into
the
cottage
she
was
lying
there
upon
the
half
asleep
her
head
fallen
back
upon
the
pillow
and
the
book
she
had
been
reading
dropped
from
her
hand
her
dress
was
of
some
coarse
stuff
which
made
a
charming
contrast
to
her
delicate
face
and
bright
hair
the
whole
interior
of
the
cottage
formed
a
picture
the
old
furniture
of
oak
almost
black
with
age
the
neutral
tints
of
the
wall
and
ceiling
and
the
deep
tone
of
her
green
dress
threw
out
into
strong
relief
the
graceful
shining
head
and
pale
face
i
suppose
she
became
subtly
conscious
as
women
always
are
that
somebody
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
for
she
awoke
fully
and
looked
up
as
i
lingered
on
the
o
dr
martin
she
cried
i
am
so
glad
she
looked
pleased
enough
to
be
upon
the
point
of
trying
to
raise
herself
up
in
order
to
welcome
me
but
i
interposed
quickly
it
was
more
difficult
than
i
had
expected
to
assume
a
grave
professional
tone
but
by
an
effort
i
did
so
i
bade
her
lie
still
and
took
a
chair
at
some
little
distance
tardif
is
gone
out
fishing
she
said
and
his
mother
is
gone
away
too
to
a
somewhere
but
renouf
is
to
be
here
in
an
hour
or
two
i
told
them
i
could
manage
very
well
as
long
as
that
they
ought
not
to
have
left
you
alone
i
replied
and
i
shall
not
be
left
alone
she
said
smiling
for
you
are
come
you
see
i
am
rather
glad
they
are
away
for
i
wanted
to
tell
you
how
much
i
felt
your
goodness
to
me
all
through
that
dreadful
week
you
are
the
first
doctor
i
ever
had
about
me
the
very
first
perhaps
you
thought
i
did
not
know
what
care
you
were
taking
of
me
but
somehow
or
other
i
knew
every
thing
my
mind
did
not
quite
go
you
were
very
very
good
to
me
never
mind
that
i
said
i
am
come
to
see
how
my
work
is
going
on
how
is
the
arm
first
of
all
i
almost
wished
that
mother
renouf
or
suzanne
tardif
had
been
at
hand
but
miss
ollivier
seemed
perfectly
composed
as
much
so
as
a
child
she
looked
like
one
with
her
cropped
head
of
hair
and
frank
open
face
my
own
momentary
embarrassment
passed
away
the
arm
was
going
on
all
right
and
so
was
mother
renouf
charge
the
sprained
ankle
we
must
take
care
you
are
not
lame
i
said
while
i
was
feeling
carefully
the
complicated
joint
of
her
ankle
lame
she
repeated
in
an
alarmed
voice
is
there
any
fear
of
that
not
much
i
answered
but
we
must
be
careful
you
must
promise
me
not
to
set
your
foot
on
the
ground
or
in
any
way
rest
your
weight
upon
it
till
i
give
you
leave
that
means
that
you
will
have
to
come
to
see
me
again
she
said
is
it
not
very
difficult
to
come
over
from
guernsey
not
at
all
i
answered
it
is
quite
a
treat
to
me
her
face
grew
very
grave
as
if
she
was
thinking
of
some
unpleasant
topic
she
looked
at
me
earnestly
and
questioningly
may
i
speak
to
you
with
great
plainness
dr
martin
she
asked
speak
precisely
what
is
in
your
mind
at
this
moment
i
replied
you
are
very
very
good
to
me
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
to
me
but
i
do
not
want
you
to
come
more
often
than
is
quite
necessary
because
i
am
very
poor
if
i
were
rich
she
went
on
hurriedly
i
should
like
you
to
come
every
day
it
is
so
pleasant
but
i
can
never
pay
you
sufficiently
for
that
long
week
you
were
here
so
please
do
not
visit
me
oftener
than
is
quite
necessary
my
face
felt
hot
but
i
scarcely
knew
what
to
say
i
bungled
out
an
answer
i
would
not
take
any
money
from
you
and
i
shall
come
to
see
you
as
often
as
i
can
i
bound
up
her
little
foot
again
without
another
word
and
then
sat
down
pushing
my
chair
farther
from
her
you
are
not
offended
with
me
dr
martin
she
asked
in
a
pleading
tone
no
i
answered
but
you
are
mistaken
in
supposing
that
a
medical
man
has
no
love
for
his
profession
apart
from
its
profits
to
see
that
your
arm
gets
properly
well
is
part
of
my
duty
and
i
shall
fulfil
it
without
any
thought
of
whether
i
shall
get
paid
for
it
or
no
now
she
said
i
must
let
you
know
how
poor
i
am
will
you
please
to
fetch
me
my
box
out
of
my
room
i
was
only
too
glad
to
obey
her
this
seemed
to
be
an
opening
to
a
complete
confidence
between
us
now
i
came
to
think
of
it
fortune
had
favored
me
in
thus
throwing
us
together
alone
i
lifted
the
small
light
box
very
easily
there
could
not
be
many
treasures
in
it
and
carried
it
back
to
her
she
took
a
key
out
of
her
pocket
and
unlocked
it
with
some
difficulty
but
she
could
not
raise
the
lid
without
my
help
i
took
care
not
to
offer
any
assistance
until
she
asked
it
yes
there
were
very
few
possessions
in
that
light
trunk
but
the
first
glance
showed
me
a
dress
and
jacket
and
hat
i
lifted
them
out
for
her
and
after
them
a
pair
of
velvet
slippers
soiled
as
if
they
had
been
through
muddy
roads
i
did
not
utter
a
remark
beneath
these
lay
a
handsome
watch
and
chain
a
fine
diamond
ring
and
five
sovereigns
lying
loose
in
the
box
that
is
all
the
money
i
have
in
the
world
she
said
sadly
i
laid
the
five
sovereigns
in
her
small
white
hand
and
she
turned
them
over
one
after
another
with
a
pitiful
look
on
her
face
i
felt
foolish
enough
to
cry
over
them
myself
martin
was
her
unexpected
question
after
a
long
pause
do
you
know
what
became
of
my
hair
why
i
asked
looking
at
her
fingers
running
through
the
short
curls
we
had
left
her
because
that
ought
to
be
sold
for
something
she
said
i
am
almost
glad
you
had
it
cut
off
my
told
me
once
he
would
give
five
guineas
for
a
head
of
hair
like
mine
it
was
so
long
and
the
color
was
uncommon
five
guineas
would
not
be
half
enough
to
pay
you
though
i
know
she
spoke
so
simply
and
quietly
that
i
did
not
attempt
to
remonstrate
with
her
about
her
anxiety
to
pay
me
tardif
has
it
i
said
but
of
course
he
will
give
it
you
back
again
shall
i
sell
it
for
you
oh
that
is
just
what
i
could
not
ask
you
she
exclaimed
you
see
there
is
no
one
to
buy
it
here
and
i
hope
it
may
be
a
long
time
before
i
go
away
i
do
know
though
that
depends
upon
whether
i
can
dispose
of
my
things
there
is
my
it
cost
guineas
last
year
and
it
ought
to
be
worth
something
and
my
watch
see
what
a
nice
one
it
is
i
should
like
to
sell
them
all
every
one
then
i
could
stay
here
as
long
as
the
money
lasted
how
much
do
you
pay
here
i
inquired
for
she
had
taken
me
so
far
into
counsel
that
i
felt
justified
in
asking
that
question
a
pound
a
week
she
answered
a
pound
a
week
i
repeated
in
amazement
does
tardif
know
that
i
do
think
he
does
she
said
when
i
had
been
here
a
week
i
gave
tardif
a
sovereign
thinking
perhaps
she
would
give
me
a
little
out
of
it
i
am
not
used
to
being
poor
and
i
did
not
know
how
much
i
ought
to
pay
but
she
kept
it
all
and
came
to
me
every
week
for
more
was
it
too
much
to
pay
too
much
i
said
you
should
have
spoken
to
tardif
about
it
my
poor
child
i
could
not
talk
to
tardif
about
his
mother
she
answered
besides
it
would
not
have
been
too
much
if
i
had
only
had
plenty
but
it
has
made
me
so
anxious
i
did
not
know
whatever
i
should
do
when
it
was
all
gone
i
do
not
know
now
here
was
a
capital
opening
for
a
question
about
her
friends
you
will
be
compelled
to
communicate
with
your
family
i
said
you
have
told
me
how
poor
you
are
can
not
you
trust
me
about
your
friends
i
have
no
friends
she
answered
sorrowfully
if
i
had
any
do
you
suppose
i
should
be
here
i
am
one
i
said
and
tardif
is
another
ah
new
friends
she
replied
but
i
mean
real
old
friends
who
have
known
you
all
your
life
like
your
mother
martin
or
your
cousin
julia
i
want
somebody
to
go
to
who
knows
all
about
me
and
say
to
them
after
telling
them
every
thing
keeping
nothing
back
at
all
i
done
right
what
else
ought
i
to
have
done
no
new
friend
could
answer
questions
like
those
was
there
any
reason
i
could
bring
forward
to
increase
her
confidence
in
me
i
thought
there
was
and
her
friendlessness
and
helplessness
touched
me
to
the
core
of
my
heart
yet
it
was
with
an
indefinable
reluctance
that
i
brought
forward
my
argument
miss
ollivier
i
said
i
have
no
claim
of
old
acquaintance
or
friendship
yet
it
is
possible
i
might
answer
those
questions
if
you
could
prevail
upon
yourself
to
tell
me
the
circumstances
of
your
former
life
in
a
few
weeks
i
shall
be
in
a
position
to
show
you
more
friendship
than
i
can
do
now
i
shall
have
a
home
of
my
own
and
a
wife
who
will
be
your
friend
more
fittingly
perhaps
than
myself
i
knew
it
she
answered
half
shyly
tardif
told
me
you
were
going
to
marry
your
cousin
julia
just
then
we
heard
the
gate
swing
to
behind
some
one
who
was
coming
to
the
house
chapter
the
thirteenth
one
in
a
thousand
i
had
altogether
forgotten
that
captain
carey
yacht
was
waiting
for
me
off
the
little
bay
below
and
i
sprang
quickly
to
the
door
in
the
dread
that
he
had
followed
me
it
was
an
immense
relief
to
see
only
tardif
tall
figure
bending
under
his
creel
and
nets
and
crossing
the
yard
slowly
i
hailed
him
and
he
quickened
his
pace
his
honest
features
lighting
up
at
the
sight
of
me
how
do
you
find
doctor
were
his
first
eager
words
all
right
i
said
going
on
famously
sark
is
enough
to
cure
any
one
and
any
thing
of
itself
tardif
there
is
no
air
like
it
i
should
not
mind
being
a
little
ill
here
myself
captain
carey
is
impatient
to
be
gone
he
continued
he
sent
word
by
me
that
you
might
be
visiting
every
house
in
the
island
you
had
been
away
so
long
not
so
very
long
i
said
testily
but
i
will
just
run
in
and
say
and
then
i
want
you
to
walk
with
me
to
the
cliff
i
turned
back
for
a
last
look
and
a
last
word
no
chance
of
learning
her
secret
now
the
picture
was
as
perfect
as
when
i
had
had
the
first
glimpse
of
it
only
her
face
had
grown
if
possible
more
charming
after
my
renewed
scrutiny
of
it
there
are
faces
that
grow
upon
you
the
longer
and
the
oftener
you
look
upon
them
faces
that
seem
to
have
a
veil
over
them
which
melts
away
like
the
thin
fine
mist
of
the
morning
upon
the
cliffs
until
they
flash
out
in
their
full
color
and
beauty
the
last
glance
was
eminently
satisfactory
and
so
was
the
last
word
shall
i
send
you
the
hair
asked
miss
ollivier
returning
practically
to
a
matter
of
business
to
be
sure
i
answered
i
shall
dispose
of
it
to
advantage
but
i
have
not
time
to
wait
for
it
now
and
may
i
write
a
letter
to
you
yes
was
my
reply
i
was
too
pleased
to
express
myself
more
eloquently
she
said
you
are
a
very
good
doctor
to
me
and
friend
i
added
and
friend
she
repeated
that
was
the
last
word
for
i
was
compelled
to
hurry
away
tardif
accompanied
me
to
the
cliff
and
i
took
the
opportunity
to
tell
him
as
pleasantly
as
i
could
the
extravagant
charge
his
mother
had
made
upon
her
lodger
and
the
girl
anxiety
about
the
future
a
more
grieved
look
never
came
across
a
man
face
martin
he
said
i
would
have
cut
off
my
hand
rather
than
it
had
been
so
poor
little
poor
old
mother
she
is
growing
old
sir
and
old
people
are
greedy
the
fall
of
the
year
is
dark
and
cold
and
gives
nothing
but
takes
away
all
it
can
and
hoards
it
for
the
young
new
spring
that
is
to
follow
it
seems
almost
the
nature
of
old
age
poor
old
mother
i
am
very
grieved
for
her
and
i
am
troubled
troubled
about
to
think
she
has
been
fretting
all
the
winter
about
this
when
i
was
trying
to
find
out
how
to
cheer
her
only
five
pounds
left
poor
little
soul
why
all
i
have
is
at
her
service
it
is
enough
to
have
her
only
in
the
house
with
her
pretty
ways
and
sweet
voice
i
put
it
all
right
with
sir
and
with
my
poor
old
mother
too
i
am
very
sorry
for
miss
ollivier
has
been
asking
me
to
sell
her
hair
i
said
no
no
he
answered
hastily
not
a
single
hair
i
can
not
say
yes
to
that
the
pretty
bright
curls
if
anybody
is
to
buy
them
i
will
yes
doctor
that
is
famous
she
wishes
you
to
sell
her
hair
very
good
i
will
buy
it
it
must
be
mine
i
have
more
money
than
you
think
perhaps
i
will
buy
pretty
curls
and
she
shall
have
the
money
and
then
there
will
be
more
than
five
pounds
in
her
little
purse
tell
me
how
much
they
will
be
ten
pounds
fifteen
twenty
nonsense
tardif
i
answered
keep
one
of
them
if
you
like
but
i
must
have
the
rest
we
will
settle
it
between
us
no
doctor
he
said
your
cousin
will
not
like
that
you
are
going
to
be
married
soon
it
would
not
do
for
you
to
keep
curls
it
was
said
with
so
much
simplicity
and
that
i
felt
ashamed
of
a
rising
feeling
of
resentment
and
parted
with
him
cordially
in
a
few
minutes
afterward
i
was
on
board
the
yacht
and
laughing
at
captain
carey
reproaches
tardif
was
still
visible
on
the
edge
of
the
cliff
watching
our
departure
that
is
as
good
a
fellow
as
ever
breathed
said
captain
carey
waving
his
cap
to
him
i
know
it
better
than
you
do
i
replied
and
how
is
the
young
woman
he
asked
going
on
as
well
as
a
broken
arm
and
a
sprained
ankle
can
do
i
answered
you
will
want
to
come
again
martin
he
said
when
are
we
to
have
another
day
well
i
shall
hear
how
she
is
every
now
and
then
i
answered
it
takes
too
long
a
time
to
come
more
often
than
is
necessary
but
you
will
bring
me
if
it
is
necessary
with
all
my
heart
said
captain
carey
for
the
next
few
days
i
waited
with
some
impatience
for
miss
promised
letter
it
came
at
last
and
i
put
it
into
my
pocket
to
read
when
i
was
alone
why
i
could
scarcely
have
explained
to
myself
dear
martin
it
began
i
have
no
little
commission
to
trouble
you
with
tardif
tells
me
it
was
quite
a
mistake
his
mother
taking
a
sovereign
from
me
each
week
she
does
not
understand
english
money
and
he
says
i
have
paid
quite
sufficient
to
stay
with
them
a
whole
year
longer
without
paying
any
more
i
am
quite
content
about
that
now
tardif
says
too
that
he
has
a
friend
in
southampton
who
will
buy
my
hair
and
give
more
than
anybody
in
guernsey
so
i
need
not
trouble
you
about
it
though
i
am
sure
you
would
have
done
it
for
me
i
have
not
put
my
foot
to
the
ground
yet
but
yesterday
tardif
carried
me
all
the
way
down
to
his
boat
and
took
me
out
for
a
little
sail
under
the
beautiful
cliffs
where
we
could
look
up
and
see
all
those
strange
carvings
upon
the
rocks
i
thought
that
perhaps
there
were
real
things
written
there
that
we
should
like
to
read
sometimes
in
the
sky
there
are
fine
faint
lines
across
the
blue
which
look
like
written
sentences
if
one
could
only
make
them
out
here
they
are
on
the
rocks
but
every
tide
washes
them
away
leaving
fresh
ones
perhaps
they
are
messages
to
me
answers
to
those
questions
that
i
can
not
answer
myself
my
good
doctor
i
am
trying
to
do
every
thing
you
told
me
exactly
and
i
am
getting
well
again
fast
i
do
not
believe
i
shall
be
lame
you
are
too
clever
for
that
your
patient
olivia
olivia
i
looked
at
the
word
again
to
make
sure
of
it
then
it
was
not
her
surname
that
was
ollivier
and
i
was
still
ignorant
of
that
i
saw
in
a
moment
how
the
mistake
had
arisen
and
how
innocent
she
was
of
any
deception
in
the
matter
she
would
tell
tardif
that
her
name
was
olivia
and
he
thought
only
of
the
olliviers
he
knew
it
was
a
mistake
that
had
been
of
use
in
checking
curiosity
and
i
did
not
feel
bound
to
put
it
right
my
mother
and
julia
appeared
to
have
forgotten
my
patient
in
sark
altogether
olivia
i
thought
it
a
very
pretty
name
and
repeated
it
to
myself
with
its
abbreviations
olive
livy
it
was
difficult
to
abbreviate
julia
ju
i
had
called
her
in
my
rudest
days
i
wondered
how
high
olivia
would
stand
beside
me
for
i
had
never
seen
her
on
her
feet
julia
was
not
two
inches
shorter
than
myself
a
tall
stiff
figure
neither
slender
enough
to
be
lissome
nor
enough
to
be
majestic
but
she
was
very
good
and
her
price
was
far
above
rubies
according
to
the
wise
man
it
was
a
difficult
task
to
find
a
virtuous
woman
it
was
a
quiet
time
in
the
afternoon
and
in
order
to
verify
my
recollection
of
the
wise
man
saying
which
was
a
little
cloudy
in
my
memory
i
searched
through
julia
bible
for
it
i
came
across
a
passage
which
made
me
pause
and
consider
behold
this
have
i
found
saith
the
preacher
counting
one
by
one
to
find
out
the
account
which
yet
my
soul
seeketh
but
i
find
not
one
man
among
a
thousand
have
i
found
but
a
woman
among
all
those
have
i
not
found
tardif
is
the
man
i
said
to
myself
but
is
julia
the
woman
have
i
had
better
luck
than
solomon
what
are
you
reading
martin
asked
my
father
who
had
just
come
in
and
was
painfully
fitting
on
a
pair
of
new
and
very
tight
kid
gloves
i
read
the
passage
aloud
without
comment
very
good
he
remarked
chuckling
upon
my
word
i
did
not
know
there
was
any
thing
as
rich
as
that
in
the
old
book
who
says
it
martin
a
very
wise
preacher
he
was
and
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
had
seen
life
eh
it
as
true
as
as
as
the
gospel
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
comparison
he
was
forced
to
yet
i
felt
angry
with
him
and
myself
what
do
you
say
about
my
mother
and
julia
sir
i
asked
he
chuckled
again
cynically
examining
with
care
a
spot
on
the
palm
of
one
of
his
gloves
ha
ha
my
son
i
hated
to
hear
him
say
my
son
i
will
answer
you
in
the
words
of
another
wise
man
virtuous
women
like
hidden
treasures
are
secure
because
nobody
seeks
after
them
so
saying
he
turned
out
of
the
room
swinging
his
cane
jauntily
between
his
fingers
i
visited
sark
again
in
about
ten
days
to
set
olivia
free
from
my
embargo
upon
her
walking
i
allowed
her
to
walk
a
little
way
along
a
smooth
leaning
on
my
arm
and
i
found
that
she
was
a
head
lower
than
myself
a
beautiful
height
for
a
woman
that
time
captain
carey
had
set
me
down
at
the
havre
gosselin
appointing
me
to
meet
him
at
the
creux
harbor
which
was
exactly
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
island
in
crossing
over
to
it
a
distance
of
rather
more
than
a
mile
i
encountered
julia
friends
emma
and
maria
brouard
you
here
again
martin
exclaimed
emma
yes
i
answered
captain
carey
set
me
down
at
the
havre
gosselin
and
is
gone
round
to
meet
me
at
the
creux
you
have
been
to
see
that
young
person
asked
maria
yes
i
replied
she
is
a
very
singular
young
woman
she
continued
we
think
her
stupid
we
can
not
make
anything
of
her
but
there
is
no
doubt
poor
tardif
means
to
marry
her
nonsense
i
ejaculated
hotly
i
beg
your
pardon
maria
but
i
give
tardif
credit
for
sense
enough
to
know
his
own
position
so
did
we
said
emma
but
it
looks
odd
he
married
an
englishwoman
before
it
old
mère
renouf
who
says
he
worships
the
ground
she
treads
upon
you
know
he
holds
a
very
good
position
in
the
island
and
he
is
a
great
favorite
with
the
seigneur
there
are
dozens
of
girls
of
his
own
class
in
guernsey
and
alderney
to
say
nothing
of
sark
who
would
be
only
too
glad
to
have
him
he
is
a
very
handsome
man
martin
tardif
is
a
fine
fellow
i
admitted
i
shall
be
very
sorry
for
him
to
be
taken
in
again
continued
emma
nobody
knows
who
that
young
person
may
be
it
looks
odd
on
the
face
of
it
are
you
in
a
hurry
well
give
our
best
love
to
dear
julia
we
are
busy
at
work
on
a
for
her
but
you
must
not
tell
her
that
you
know
i
went
on
in
a
hot
rage
shapeless
and
wordless
but
smouldering
like
a
fire
within
me
the
cool
green
lane
deep
between
the
banks
of
which
were
gemmed
with
primroses
had
no
effect
upon
me
just
then
tardif
marry
olivia
that
was
an
absurd
preposterous
notion
indeed
it
required
all
my
knowledge
of
the
influence
of
dress
on
the
average
human
mind
to
convince
myself
that
olivia
in
her
coarse
green
serge
dress
had
impressed
the
people
of
sark
with
the
notion
that
she
would
be
no
unsuitable
mate
for
their
rough
though
good
and
handsome
fisherman
was
it
possible
that
they
thought
her
stupid
reserved
and
silent
she
might
be
as
she
wished
to
remain
unmolested
and
concealed
but
not
stupid
that
any
one
should
dream
so
wildly
as
to
think
of
olivia
marrying
tardif
was
the
utmost
folly
i
could
imagine
i
had
half
an
hour
to
wait
in
the
little
harbor
its
great
cliffs
rising
all
about
me
with
only
a
tunnel
bored
through
them
to
form
an
entrance
to
the
green
island
within
my
rage
had
partly
fumed
itself
away
before
the
yacht
came
in
sight
chapter
the
fourteenth
overhead
in
love
awfully
fast
the
time
sped
away
it
was
the
second
week
in
march
i
passed
in
sark
the
second
week
in
may
came
upon
me
as
if
borne
by
a
whirlwind
it
was
only
a
month
to
the
day
so
long
fixed
upon
for
our
marriage
my
mother
began
to
fidget
about
my
going
over
to
london
to
pay
my
farewell
bachelor
visit
to
jack
senior
and
to
fit
myself
out
with
wedding
toggery
julia
was
going
on
fast
to
completion
our
trip
to
switzerland
was
distinctly
planned
out
almost
from
day
to
day
go
i
must
to
london
order
my
i
must
but
first
there
could
be
no
harm
in
running
over
to
sark
to
see
olivia
once
more
as
soon
as
i
was
married
i
would
tell
julia
all
about
her
but
if
either
arm
or
ankle
went
wrong
for
want
of
attention
i
should
never
forgive
myself
when
shall
we
have
another
run
together
captain
carey
i
asked
any
day
you
like
my
boy
he
answered
your
days
of
liberty
are
growing
few
and
short
now
eh
i
never
had
a
chance
of
trying
it
myself
martin
but
they
are
nervous
times
i
should
think
cruising
in
doubtful
channels
eh
with
uncertain
breezes
how
does
julia
keep
up
i
can
spare
i
replied
ignoring
his
remarks
on
saturday
i
shall
cross
over
to
england
to
see
jack
senior
and
bid
him
adieu
he
said
laughing
or
give
him
an
invitation
to
your
own
house
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
in
a
house
of
your
own
your
father
is
too
young
a
man
for
you
can
you
take
me
to
sark
i
asked
to
be
sure
i
can
he
answered
it
was
the
last
time
i
could
see
olivia
before
my
marriage
afterward
i
should
see
much
of
her
for
julia
would
invite
her
to
our
house
and
be
a
friend
to
her
i
spent
a
wretchedly
sleepless
night
and
whenever
i
dozed
by
fits
and
starts
i
saw
olivia
before
me
weeping
bitterly
and
refusing
to
be
comforted
from
sampson
we
set
sail
straight
for
the
havre
gosselin
without
a
word
upon
my
part
and
the
wind
being
in
our
favor
we
were
not
long
in
crossing
the
channel
to
my
extreme
surprise
and
chagrin
captain
carey
announced
his
intention
of
landing
with
me
and
leaving
the
yacht
in
charge
of
his
men
to
await
our
return
the
ladder
is
excessively
awkward
i
objected
and
some
of
the
rungs
are
loose
you
do
mind
running
the
risk
of
a
plunge
into
the
water
not
in
the
least
he
answered
cheerily
for
the
matter
of
that
i
plunge
into
it
every
morning
at
i
want
to
see
tardif
he
is
one
in
a
thousand
as
you
say
and
one
can
not
see
such
a
man
every
day
of
one
life
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
i
gave
in
hoping
some
good
luck
awaited
me
i
led
the
way
up
the
zigzag
path
and
just
as
we
reached
the
top
i
saw
the
slight
erect
figure
of
olivia
seated
upon
the
brow
of
a
little
grassy
knoll
at
a
short
distance
from
us
her
back
was
toward
us
so
she
was
not
aware
of
our
vicinity
and
i
pointed
toward
her
with
an
assumed
air
of
indifference
i
believe
that
is
my
patient
yonder
i
said
i
will
just
run
across
and
speak
to
her
and
then
follow
you
to
the
farm
ah
he
exclaimed
there
is
a
lovely
view
from
that
spot
i
recollect
it
well
i
will
go
with
you
martin
there
will
be
time
enough
to
see
tardif
did
captain
carey
suspect
any
thing
or
what
reason
could
he
have
for
wishing
to
see
olivia
could
it
be
merely
that
he
wanted
to
see
the
view
from
that
particular
spot
i
could
not
forbid
him
accompanying
me
but
i
wished
him
at
jericho
what
is
more
stupid
than
to
have
an
elderly
man
dogging
one
footsteps
i
trusted
devoutly
that
we
should
see
or
hear
tardif
before
reaching
the
knoll
but
no
such
good
fortune
befell
me
olivia
did
not
hear
our
footsteps
upon
the
soft
turf
though
we
approached
her
very
nearly
the
sun
shone
upon
her
glossy
hair
every
thread
of
which
seemed
to
shine
back
again
she
was
reading
aloud
apparently
to
herself
and
the
sounds
of
her
sweet
voice
were
wafted
by
the
air
toward
us
captain
face
became
very
thoughtful
a
few
steps
nearer
brought
us
in
view
of
tardif
who
had
spread
his
nets
on
the
grass
and
was
examining
them
narrowly
for
rents
just
at
this
moment
he
was
down
on
his
knees
not
far
from
olivia
gathering
some
broken
meshes
together
but
listening
to
her
with
an
expression
of
huge
contentment
upon
his
handsome
face
a
bitter
pang
shot
through
me
could
it
be
true
by
any
possibility
that
lie
i
had
heard
the
last
time
i
was
in
sark
tardif
shouted
captain
carey
and
both
tardif
and
olivia
started
but
both
of
their
faces
grew
brighter
at
seeing
us
and
both
sprang
up
to
give
us
welcome
olivia
color
had
come
back
to
her
cheeks
and
a
sweeter
face
no
man
ever
looked
upon
i
am
very
glad
you
are
come
once
more
she
said
putting
her
hand
in
mine
you
told
me
in
your
last
letter
you
were
going
to
england
and
might
not
come
over
to
sark
before
next
autumn
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
again
i
glanced
from
the
corner
of
my
eye
at
captain
carey
he
looked
very
grave
but
his
eyes
could
not
rest
upon
olivia
without
admiring
her
as
she
stood
before
us
slender
erect
with
the
heavy
folds
of
her
coarse
dress
falling
about
her
as
gracefully
as
if
they
were
of
the
richest
material
this
is
my
friend
captain
carey
miss
olivia
i
said
in
whose
yacht
i
have
come
over
to
visit
you
i
am
very
glad
to
see
any
friend
of
martin
she
answered
as
she
hold
out
her
hand
to
him
with
a
smile
my
doctor
and
i
are
great
friends
captain
carey
so
i
suppose
he
said
significantly
or
at
least
his
tone
and
look
seemed
fraught
with
significance
to
me
we
were
talking
of
you
only
a
few
minutes
ago
martin
she
continued
i
was
telling
tardif
how
you
sang
the
fishers
to
me
the
last
time
you
were
here
and
how
it
rings
in
my
ears
still
especially
when
he
is
away
fishing
i
repeated
the
three
last
lines
to
him
men
must
work
and
women
must
weep
and
the
sooner
it
over
the
sooner
to
sleep
so
to
the
bar
with
its
moaning
i
do
not
like
it
doctor
said
tardif
there
no
hope
in
it
yet
to
sleep
out
yonder
at
last
on
the
great
plain
under
the
sea
would
be
no
bad
thing
you
must
sing
it
for
tardif
added
olivia
with
a
pretty
imperiousness
and
then
he
will
like
it
my
throat
felt
dry
and
my
tongue
parched
i
could
not
utter
a
word
in
reply
this
would
be
the
very
place
for
such
a
song
said
captain
carey
come
martin
let
us
have
it
no
i
can
sing
nothing
i
answered
harshly
the
very
sight
of
her
made
me
feel
miserable
beyond
words
the
sound
of
her
voice
maddened
me
i
felt
as
if
i
was
angry
with
her
almost
to
hatred
for
her
grace
and
sweetness
yet
i
could
have
knelt
down
at
her
feet
and
been
happy
only
to
lay
my
hand
on
a
fold
of
her
dress
no
feeling
had
ever
stirred
me
so
before
and
it
made
me
irritable
olivia
clear
gray
eyes
looked
at
me
wonderingly
is
there
anything
the
matter
with
you
dr
martin
she
inquired
no
i
replied
turning
away
from
her
abruptly
every
one
of
them
felt
my
rudeness
and
there
was
a
dead
silence
among
us
for
half
a
minute
which
seemed
an
age
to
me
then
i
heard
captain
carey
speaking
in
his
suavest
tones
are
you
quite
well
again
miss
ollivier
he
asked
yes
quite
well
i
think
she
said
in
a
very
subdued
voice
i
can
not
walk
far
yet
and
my
arm
is
still
weak
but
i
think
i
am
quite
well
i
have
given
martin
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
anxiety
she
spoke
in
the
low
quiet
tones
of
a
child
who
has
been
chidden
unreasonably
i
was
asking
myself
what
captain
carey
meant
by
not
leaving
me
alone
with
my
patient
when
a
medical
man
makes
a
call
the
intrusion
of
any
unprofessional
indifferent
person
is
unpardonable
if
it
had
been
suzanne
tardif
or
mother
renouf
who
was
keeping
so
close
beside
us
i
could
have
made
no
reasonable
objection
but
captain
carey
tardif
i
said
captain
carey
came
ashore
on
purpose
to
visit
you
and
your
farm
i
knew
he
was
excessively
proud
of
his
farm
which
consisted
of
about
four
or
five
acres
he
caught
at
the
words
with
alacrity
and
led
the
way
toward
his
house
with
tremendous
strides
there
was
no
means
of
evading
a
tour
of
inspection
though
captain
carey
appeared
to
follow
him
reluctantly
olivia
and
i
were
left
alone
but
she
was
moving
after
them
slowly
when
i
ran
to
her
and
offered
her
my
arm
on
the
plea
that
her
ankle
was
still
too
weak
to
bear
her
weight
unsupported
olivia
i
exclaimed
after
we
had
gone
a
few
yards
bringing
her
and
myself
to
a
sudden
halt
then
i
was
struck
dumb
i
had
nothing
special
to
say
to
her
how
was
it
i
had
called
her
so
familiarly
olivia
well
dr
martin
she
said
looking
into
my
face
again
with
eager
inquiring
eyes
as
if
she
was
wishful
to
understand
my
varying
moods
if
she
could
what
a
lovely
place
this
is
i
ejaculated
more
lovely
than
any
words
i
ever
heard
could
describe
it
was
a
perfect
day
and
a
perfect
view
the
sea
was
like
an
opal
changing
every
minute
with
the
passing
shadows
of
clouds
which
floated
lazily
across
the
bright
blue
of
the
sky
the
cliffs
sark
cliffs
which
have
not
their
equal
in
the
world
stretched
below
us
with
every
hue
of
gold
and
bronze
and
hoary
white
and
soft
gray
and
here
and
there
a
black
rock
with
livid
shades
of
purple
and
a
bloom
upon
it
like
a
wing
rocky
islets
never
trodden
by
human
foot
over
which
the
foam
poured
ceaselessly
were
dotted
all
about
the
changeful
surface
of
the
water
and
just
beneath
the
level
of
my
eyes
was
olivia
face
the
loveliest
thing
there
though
there
was
so
much
beauty
lying
around
us
yes
it
is
a
lovely
place
she
assented
a
mischievous
smile
playing
about
her
lips
olivia
i
said
taking
my
courage
by
both
hands
it
is
only
a
month
now
till
my
was
i
deceiving
myself
or
did
she
really
grow
paler
it
was
but
for
a
moment
if
it
were
so
but
how
cold
the
air
felt
all
in
an
instant
the
shock
was
like
that
of
a
first
plunge
into
chilly
waters
and
i
was
shivering
through
every
fibre
i
hope
you
will
be
happy
said
olivia
very
happy
it
is
a
great
risk
to
run
marriage
will
make
you
either
very
happy
or
very
wretched
not
at
all
i
answered
trying
to
speak
gayly
i
do
not
look
forward
to
any
vast
amount
of
rapture
julia
and
i
will
get
along
very
well
together
i
have
no
doubt
for
we
have
known
one
another
all
our
lives
i
do
not
expect
to
be
any
happier
than
other
men
and
the
married
people
i
have
known
have
not
exactly
dwelt
in
paradise
perhaps
your
experience
has
been
different
oh
no
she
said
her
hand
trembling
on
my
arm
and
her
face
very
downcast
but
i
should
have
liked
you
to
be
very
very
happy
so
softly
spoken
with
such
a
low
faltering
voice
i
could
not
trust
myself
to
speak
again
a
stern
sense
of
duty
toward
julia
kept
me
silent
and
we
moved
on
though
very
slowly
and
lingeringly
you
love
her
very
much
said
the
quiet
voice
at
my
side
not
much
louder
than
the
voice
of
conscience
which
was
speaking
imperiously
just
then
i
esteem
her
more
highly
than
any
other
woman
except
my
mother
i
said
i
believe
she
would
die
sooner
than
do
any
thing
she
considered
wrong
i
do
not
deserve
her
and
she
loves
me
i
am
sure
very
truly
and
faithfully
do
you
think
she
will
like
me
asked
olivia
anxiously
no
she
must
love
you
i
said
with
warmth
and
i
too
can
be
a
more
useful
friend
to
you
after
my
marriage
than
i
am
now
perhaps
then
you
will
feel
free
to
place
perfect
confidence
in
us
she
smiled
faintly
without
speaking
a
smile
which
said
plainly
she
could
keep
her
own
secret
closely
it
provoked
me
to
do
a
thing
i
had
had
no
intention
of
doing
and
which
i
regretted
very
much
afterward
i
opened
my
and
drew
out
the
little
slip
of
paper
containing
the
advertisement
read
that
i
said
but
i
do
not
think
she
saw
more
than
the
first
line
for
her
face
went
deadly
white
and
her
eyes
turned
upon
me
with
a
wild
beseeching
look
as
tardif
described
it
the
look
of
a
creature
hunted
and
terrified
i
thought
she
would
have
fallen
and
i
put
my
arm
round
her
she
fastened
both
her
hands
about
mine
and
her
lips
moved
though
i
could
not
catch
a
word
she
was
saying
olivia
i
cried
olivia
do
you
suppose
i
could
do
any
thing
to
hurt
you
do
not
be
so
frightened
why
i
am
your
friend
truly
i
wish
to
heaven
i
had
not
shown
you
the
thing
have
more
faith
in
me
and
more
courage
but
they
will
find
me
and
force
me
away
from
here
she
muttered
no
i
said
that
advertisement
was
printed
in
the
directly
after
your
flight
last
october
they
have
not
found
you
out
yet
and
the
longer
you
are
hidden
the
less
likely
they
are
to
find
you
good
heavens
what
a
fool
i
was
to
show
it
to
you
never
mind
she
answered
recovering
herself
a
little
but
still
clinging
to
my
arm
i
was
only
frightened
for
the
time
you
would
not
give
me
up
to
them
if
you
knew
all
give
you
up
to
them
i
repeated
bitterly
am
i
a
judas
but
she
could
not
talk
to
me
any
more
she
was
trembling
like
an
and
her
breath
came
sobbingly
all
i
could
do
was
to
take
her
home
blaming
myself
for
my
cursed
folly
captain
carey
and
tardif
met
us
at
the
gate
but
olivia
could
not
speak
to
them
and
we
passed
them
in
silence
challenged
by
their
inquisitive
looks
she
could
only
bid
me
in
a
tremulous
voice
and
i
watched
her
go
on
into
her
own
little
room
and
close
the
door
between
us
that
was
the
last
i
should
see
of
her
before
my
marriage
tardif
walked
with
us
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
made
me
a
formal
congratulatory
speech
before
quitting
us
when
he
was
gone
captain
carey
stood
still
until
he
was
quite
out
of
hearing
and
then
stretched
out
his
hand
toward
the
thatched
roof
yellow
with
and
lichens
this
is
a
serious
business
martin
he
said
looking
sternly
at
me
you
are
in
love
with
that
girl
i
love
her
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
i
cried
chapter
the
fifteenth
in
a
fix
yes
i
loved
olivia
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
i
had
not
known
it
myself
till
that
moment
and
now
i
acknowledged
it
boldly
almost
defiantly
with
a
strange
mingling
of
delight
and
pain
in
the
confession
yet
the
words
startled
me
as
i
uttered
them
they
had
involved
in
them
so
many
unpleasant
consequences
so
much
chagrin
and
bitterness
as
their
practical
result
that
i
stood
aghast
even
while
my
pulses
throbbed
and
my
heart
beat
high
with
the
novel
rapture
of
loving
any
woman
as
i
loved
olivia
if
i
followed
out
my
avowal
to
its
just
issue
i
should
be
a
traitor
to
julia
and
all
my
life
up
to
the
present
moment
would
be
lost
to
me
i
had
scarcely
spoken
it
before
i
dropped
my
head
on
my
hands
with
a
groan
come
come
my
poor
fellow
said
captain
carey
who
could
never
see
a
dog
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
without
whistling
to
him
and
patting
him
we
must
see
what
can
be
done
it
was
neither
a
time
nor
a
place
for
the
indulgence
of
emotion
of
any
kind
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
remain
on
the
cliffs
bemoaning
my
unhappy
fate
i
strode
on
doggedly
down
the
path
kicking
the
loose
stones
into
the
water
as
they
came
in
my
way
captain
carey
followed
whistling
softly
to
himself
and
of
all
the
tunes
in
the
world
he
chose
the
one
to
the
three
fishers
which
i
had
sung
to
olivia
he
continued
doing
so
after
we
were
aboard
the
yacht
and
i
saw
the
boatmen
exchange
apprehensive
glances
we
shall
have
wind
enough
without
whistling
for
it
before
we
reach
guernsey
said
one
of
them
after
a
while
and
captain
carey
relapsed
into
silence
we
scarcely
spoke
again
except
about
the
shifting
of
the
sails
in
our
passage
across
a
pretty
stiff
breeze
was
blowing
and
we
found
plenty
of
occupation
i
can
not
leave
you
like
this
martin
my
boy
said
captain
carey
when
we
went
ashore
at
sampson
and
he
put
his
arm
through
mine
affectionately
you
will
keep
my
secret
i
said
my
voice
a
key
or
two
lower
than
usual
martin
answered
the
old
bachelor
you
must
not
do
julia
the
wrong
of
keeping
this
secret
from
her
i
must
i
urged
olivia
knows
nothing
of
it
nobody
guesses
it
but
you
i
must
conquer
it
things
have
gone
too
far
with
poor
julia
for
me
to
back
out
of
our
marriage
now
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
think
of
it
captain
carey
but
shall
you
conquer
it
asked
captain
carey
seriously
i
could
not
answer
yes
frankly
and
freely
it
seemed
a
sheer
impossibility
for
me
to
root
out
this
new
love
which
i
found
in
my
heart
below
all
the
old
loves
and
friendships
of
my
whole
life
mad
as
i
was
with
myself
at
the
thought
of
my
folly
the
folly
was
so
sweet
to
me
that
i
would
as
soon
have
parted
with
life
itself
nothing
in
the
least
resembling
this
feeling
had
been
a
matter
of
experience
with
me
before
i
had
read
of
it
in
poetry
and
novels
and
laughed
a
little
at
it
but
now
it
had
come
upon
me
like
a
strong
man
armed
i
quailed
and
flinched
before
the
painful
conflict
necessary
to
cast
out
the
precious
guest
martin
urged
captain
carey
come
up
to
johanna
and
tell
her
all
about
it
johanna
carey
was
one
of
the
powers
in
the
island
everybody
knew
her
and
everybody
went
to
her
for
comfort
and
counsel
she
was
of
course
related
to
us
all
and
knew
the
exact
degree
of
relationship
among
us
having
the
genealogy
of
each
family
at
her
fingers
ends
but
besides
these
family
histories
which
were
common
property
she
was
also
intrusted
with
the
inmost
secrets
of
every
household
those
secrets
which
were
the
most
carefully
and
jealously
guarded
i
had
always
been
a
favorite
with
her
and
nothing
could
be
more
natural
than
this
proposal
of
her
brother
that
i
should
go
and
tell
her
all
my
dilemma
the
house
stood
on
the
border
of
common
with
no
view
of
the
sea
but
with
the
soft
undulating
brows
and
hollows
of
the
common
lying
before
it
and
a
broken
battlement
of
rocks
rising
beyond
them
there
was
always
a
low
solemn
murmur
of
the
invisible
sea
singing
like
a
lullaby
about
the
peaceful
dwelling
and
hushing
it
into
a
more
profound
quiet
than
even
utter
silence
for
utter
silence
is
irksome
and
fretting
to
the
ear
which
needs
some
slight
reverberation
to
keep
the
brain
behind
it
still
a
perfume
of
violets
and
the
more
dainty
scent
of
primroses
pervaded
the
garden
it
seemed
incredible
that
any
man
should
be
allowed
to
live
in
such
a
spot
but
then
captain
carey
was
almost
as
gentle
and
fastidious
as
a
woman
johanna
was
not
unlike
her
home
there
was
a
repose
about
her
similar
to
the
calm
of
a
judge
which
gave
additional
weight
to
her
counsels
the
moment
we
entered
through
the
gates
a
certainty
of
comfort
and
help
appeared
to
be
wafted
upon
the
pure
breeze
floating
across
the
common
from
the
sea
johanna
was
standing
at
one
of
the
windows
in
a
quakerish
dress
of
some
gray
stuff
and
with
a
plain
white
cap
over
her
white
hair
she
came
down
to
the
door
as
soon
as
she
saw
me
and
received
me
with
a
motherly
kiss
which
i
returned
with
more
than
usual
warmth
as
one
does
in
any
new
kind
of
trouble
i
think
she
was
instantly
aware
that
something
was
amiss
with
me
is
dinner
ready
johanna
asked
her
brother
we
are
as
hungry
as
hunters
that
was
not
true
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
for
the
first
time
within
my
recollection
my
appetite
quite
failed
me
and
i
merely
played
with
my
knife
and
fork
captain
carey
regarded
me
pitifully
and
said
come
come
martin
my
boy
several
times
johanna
made
no
remark
but
her
quiet
searching
eyes
looked
me
through
and
through
till
i
almost
longed
for
the
time
when
she
would
begin
to
question
and
me
after
she
was
gone
captain
carey
gave
me
two
or
three
glasses
of
his
choicest
wine
to
cheer
me
up
as
he
said
but
we
were
not
long
before
we
followed
his
sister
johanna
said
captain
carey
we
have
something
to
tell
you
come
and
sit
here
by
me
she
said
making
room
for
me
beside
her
on
her
sofa
for
long
experience
had
taught
her
how
much
more
difficult
it
is
to
make
a
confession
face
to
face
with
one
confessor
under
the
fire
of
his
eyes
as
it
were
than
when
one
is
partially
concealed
from
him
well
she
said
in
her
calm
inviting
voice
johanna
i
replied
i
am
in
a
terrible
fix
awful
cried
captain
carey
sympathetically
but
a
glance
from
his
sister
put
him
to
silence
what
is
it
my
dear
martin
asked
her
inviting
voice
again
i
will
tell
you
frankly
i
said
feeling
i
must
have
it
out
at
once
like
an
aching
tooth
i
love
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
that
girl
in
sark
the
one
who
has
been
my
patient
there
martin
she
cried
in
a
tone
full
of
surprise
and
agitation
martin
yes
i
know
all
you
would
urge
my
honor
my
affection
for
julia
the
claims
she
has
upon
me
the
strongest
claims
possible
how
good
and
worthy
she
is
what
an
impossibility
it
is
even
to
look
back
now
i
know
it
all
and
feel
how
miserably
binding
it
is
upon
me
yet
i
love
olivia
and
i
shall
never
love
julia
martin
she
cried
again
listen
to
me
johanna
i
said
for
now
the
ice
was
broken
my
frozen
words
were
flowing
as
rapidly
as
a
runnel
of
water
i
used
to
dream
of
a
feeling
something
like
this
years
ago
but
no
girl
i
saw
could
kindle
it
into
reality
i
have
always
esteemed
julia
and
when
my
youth
was
over
and
i
had
never
felt
any
devouring
passion
i
began
to
think
love
was
more
of
a
word
than
a
fact
or
to
believe
that
it
had
become
only
a
word
in
these
cold
late
times
at
any
rate
i
concluded
i
was
past
the
age
for
falling
in
love
there
was
my
cousin
julia
certainly
dearer
to
me
than
any
other
woman
except
my
mother
i
knew
all
her
little
ways
and
they
were
not
annoying
to
me
or
were
so
in
a
very
small
degree
besides
my
father
had
had
a
grand
passion
for
my
mother
and
what
had
that
come
to
there
would
be
no
such
white
ashes
of
a
spent
fire
for
julia
to
shiver
over
that
was
how
i
argued
the
matter
out
with
myself
at
i
had
never
lost
a
quarter
of
an
hour
sleep
or
missed
a
meal
for
the
sake
of
any
girl
surely
i
was
safe
it
was
quite
fair
for
me
to
propose
to
julia
and
she
would
be
satisfied
with
the
affection
i
could
offer
her
then
there
was
my
mother
it
was
the
greatest
happiness
i
could
give
her
and
her
life
has
not
been
a
happy
one
god
knows
so
i
proposed
to
julia
and
she
accepted
me
last
christmas
and
you
are
to
be
married
next
month
said
johanna
in
an
exceedingly
troubled
tone
yes
i
answered
and
now
every
word
julia
speaks
and
every
thing
she
does
grates
upon
me
i
love
her
as
much
as
ever
as
my
cousin
but
as
my
wife
good
heavens
johanna
i
can
not
tell
you
how
i
dread
it
what
can
be
done
she
exclaimed
looking
from
me
to
captain
carey
whose
face
was
as
full
of
dismay
as
her
own
but
he
only
shook
his
head
despondingly
done
i
repeated
nothing
absolutely
nothing
it
is
utterly
impossible
to
draw
back
our
house
is
nearly
ready
for
us
and
even
julia
and
veil
are
bought
there
is
not
a
house
you
enter
said
johanna
solemnly
where
they
are
not
preparing
a
for
julia
and
you
there
has
not
been
a
marriage
in
your
district
among
ourselves
for
nine
years
it
is
as
public
as
a
royal
marriage
it
must
go
on
i
answered
with
the
calmness
of
despair
i
am
the
most
scoundrel
in
guernsey
to
fall
in
love
with
my
patient
you
need
not
tell
me
so
johanna
and
yet
if
i
could
think
that
olivia
loved
me
i
would
not
change
with
the
happiest
man
alive
what
is
her
name
asked
johanna
one
of
the
olliviers
answered
captain
carey
but
what
olliviers
she
belongs
to
i
do
know
she
is
one
of
the
prettiest
creatures
i
ever
saw
an
ollivier
exclaimed
johanna
in
her
severest
accents
martin
what
you
thinking
of
her
christian
name
is
olivia
i
said
hastily
she
does
not
belong
to
the
olliviers
at
all
it
was
tardif
mistake
and
very
natural
she
was
born
in
australia
i
believe
of
a
good
family
i
hope
asked
johanna
there
are
some
persons
it
would
be
a
disgrace
to
you
to
love
what
is
her
other
name
i
do
know
i
answered
reluctantly
but
distinctly
johanna
turned
her
face
full
upon
me
now
a
face
more
agitated
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
there
was
no
use
in
trying
to
keep
back
any
part
of
my
serious
delinquency
so
i
resolved
to
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
i
know
very
little
about
her
i
said
that
is
about
her
history
as
for
herself
she
is
the
sweetest
dearest
loveliest
girl
in
the
whole
world
to
me
if
i
were
free
and
she
loved
me
i
should
not
know
what
else
to
wish
for
all
i
know
is
that
she
has
run
away
from
her
people
why
i
have
no
more
idea
than
you
have
or
who
they
are
or
where
they
live
and
she
has
been
living
in
tardif
cottage
since
last
october
it
is
an
infatuation
do
you
say
so
it
is
i
dare
say
it
is
an
infatuation
and
i
do
know
that
i
shall
ever
shake
it
off
what
is
she
like
asked
johanna
is
she
very
merry
and
bright
i
never
saw
her
laugh
i
said
very
melancholy
and
sad
then
i
never
saw
her
weep
i
said
what
is
it
then
martin
she
asked
earnestly
i
can
not
tell
what
it
is
i
answered
everything
she
does
and
says
has
a
charm
for
me
that
i
could
never
describe
with
her
for
my
wife
i
should
be
more
happy
than
i
ever
was
with
any
one
else
i
shall
be
wretched
that
is
all
i
know
i
had
left
my
seat
by
johanna
and
was
pacing
to
and
fro
in
the
room
too
restless
and
miserable
to
keep
still
the
low
moan
of
the
sea
sighed
all
about
the
house
i
could
have
cast
myself
on
the
floor
had
i
been
alone
and
wept
and
sobbed
like
a
woman
i
could
see
no
of
escape
from
the
mesh
of
circumstances
which
caught
me
in
their
net
a
long
dreary
colorless
wretched
life
stretched
before
me
with
julia
my
inseparable
companion
and
olivia
altogether
lost
to
me
captain
carey
and
johanna
neither
of
whom
had
tasted
the
sweets
and
bitters
of
marriage
looked
sorrowfully
at
me
and
shook
their
heads
you
must
tell
julia
said
johanna
after
a
long
pause
tell
julia
i
echoed
i
would
not
tell
her
for
worlds
you
must
tell
her
she
repeated
it
is
your
clear
duty
i
know
it
will
be
most
painful
to
you
both
but
you
have
no
right
to
marry
her
with
this
secret
on
your
mind
i
should
be
true
to
her
i
interrupted
somewhat
angrily
what
do
you
call
being
true
martin
dobrée
she
asked
more
calmly
than
she
had
spoken
before
is
it
being
true
to
a
woman
to
let
her
believe
you
choose
and
love
her
above
all
other
women
when
that
is
absolutely
false
no
you
are
too
honorable
for
that
i
tell
you
it
is
your
plain
duty
to
let
julia
know
this
and
know
it
at
once
it
will
break
her
heart
i
said
with
a
sharp
twinge
of
conscience
and
a
cowardly
shrinking
from
the
unpleasant
duty
urged
upon
me
it
will
not
break
julia
heart
said
johanna
very
sadly
it
may
break
your
mother
i
reeled
as
if
a
sharp
blow
had
struck
me
i
had
been
thinking
far
less
of
my
mother
than
of
julia
but
i
saw
as
with
a
flash
of
lightning
what
a
complete
uprooting
of
all
her
old
habits
and
hopes
this
would
prove
to
my
mother
whose
heart
was
so
set
upon
this
marriage
would
julia
marry
me
if
she
once
heard
of
my
unfortunate
love
for
olivia
and
if
not
what
would
become
of
our
home
my
mother
would
have
to
give
up
one
of
us
for
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
she
would
consent
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
me
now
the
happy
tie
of
cousinship
was
broken
and
none
dearer
to
be
formed
which
could
my
mother
part
with
best
julia
was
almost
as
much
her
daughter
as
i
was
her
son
yet
me
she
pined
after
if
ever
i
was
absent
long
no
i
could
not
resolve
to
run
the
risk
of
breaking
that
gentle
faithful
heart
which
loved
me
so
fully
i
went
back
to
johanna
and
took
her
hand
in
both
of
mine
keep
my
secret
i
said
earnestly
you
two
i
will
make
julia
and
my
mother
happy
do
not
mistrust
me
this
infatuation
overpowered
me
unawares
i
will
conquer
it
at
the
worst
i
can
conceal
it
i
promise
you
julia
shall
never
regret
being
my
wife
martin
answered
johanna
determinedly
if
you
do
not
tell
julia
i
must
tell
her
myself
you
say
you
love
this
other
girl
with
all
your
heart
and
soul
yes
and
that
is
true
i
said
then
julia
must
know
before
she
marries
you
nothing
could
move
johanna
from
that
position
and
in
my
heart
i
recognized
its
righteousness
she
argued
with
me
that
it
was
julia
due
to
hear
it
from
myself
i
knew
afterward
that
she
believed
the
sight
of
her
distress
and
firm
love
for
myself
would
dissipate
the
infatuation
of
my
love
for
olivia
but
she
did
not
read
julia
character
as
well
as
my
mother
did
before
she
let
me
leave
her
i
had
promised
to
have
my
confession
and
subsequent
explanation
with
julia
all
over
the
following
day
and
to
make
this
the
more
inevitable
she
told
me
she
should
drive
into
the
next
afternoon
about
five
when
she
should
expect
to
find
this
troublesome
matter
settled
either
by
a
renewal
of
my
affection
for
my
betrothed
or
the
suspension
of
the
betrothal
in
the
latter
case
she
promised
to
carry
julia
home
with
her
until
the
first
bitterness
was
over
chapter
the
sixteenth
a
midnight
ride
i
took
care
not
to
reach
home
before
the
hour
when
julia
usually
went
to
bed
she
had
been
out
in
the
country
all
day
visiting
the
south
cliffs
of
our
island
with
some
acquaintances
from
england
who
were
staying
for
a
few
days
in
in
all
probability
she
would
be
too
tired
to
sit
up
till
my
return
if
i
were
late
i
had
calculated
aright
it
was
after
eleven
when
i
entered
and
my
mother
only
was
waiting
for
me
i
wished
to
avoid
any
confidential
chat
that
evening
and
after
answering
briefly
her
fond
inquiries
as
to
what
could
have
kept
me
out
so
late
i
took
myself
off
to
my
own
room
but
it
was
quite
vain
to
think
of
sleep
that
night
i
had
soon
worked
myself
up
into
that
state
of
nervous
restless
agitation
when
one
can
not
remain
quietly
in
one
room
i
attempted
to
conquer
it
but
i
could
not
the
moon
which
was
at
the
full
was
shining
out
of
a
cloudless
field
of
sky
upon
my
window
i
longed
for
fresh
air
and
freedom
and
motion
for
a
distance
between
myself
and
my
dear
old
home
that
home
which
i
was
about
to
plunge
into
troubled
waters
the
peacefulness
oppressed
me
about
one
i
opened
my
door
as
softly
as
possible
and
stole
silently
downstairs
but
not
so
silently
that
my
mother
quick
ear
did
not
catch
the
slight
jarring
of
my
door
the
hung
in
my
room
and
occasionally
i
was
summoned
away
at
hours
like
this
to
visit
a
patient
she
called
to
me
as
i
crept
down
the
stairs
martin
what
is
the
matter
she
whispered
over
the
banisters
nothing
mother
nothing
much
i
answered
i
shall
be
home
again
in
an
hour
or
two
go
to
bed
and
go
to
sleep
whatever
makes
you
so
are
you
going
to
take
madam
she
asked
seeing
my
whip
in
my
hand
shall
i
ring
up
pellet
no
no
i
said
i
can
manage
well
enough
again
my
darling
old
mother
her
pale
worn
face
smiled
down
upon
me
very
tenderly
as
she
kissed
her
hand
to
me
i
stood
as
if
spellbound
watching
her
and
she
watching
me
until
we
both
laughed
though
somewhat
falteringly
how
romantic
you
are
my
boy
she
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
i
shall
not
stir
till
you
go
back
to
bed
i
answered
peremptorily
and
as
just
then
we
heard
my
father
calling
out
fretfully
to
ask
why
the
door
was
open
and
what
was
going
on
in
the
house
she
disappeared
and
i
went
on
my
way
to
the
stables
madam
was
my
favorite
mare
at
a
gallop
when
she
was
in
good
temper
but
apt
to
turn
vicious
now
and
then
she
was
in
good
temper
and
pricked
up
her
ears
and
whinnied
when
i
unlocked
the
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
going
up
the
grange
road
at
a
moderate
pace
till
we
reached
the
open
country
and
the
long
white
dusty
roads
stretched
before
us
glimmering
in
the
moonlight
i
turned
for
martin
and
madam
at
the
first
touch
of
my
whip
on
her
flanks
started
off
at
a
long
and
steady
gallop
it
was
a
cool
quiet
night
in
may
a
few
of
the
larger
fixed
stars
twinkled
palely
in
the
sky
but
the
smaller
ones
were
drowned
in
the
full
moonlight
the
largest
of
them
shone
solemnly
and
brightly
in
afield
of
golden
green
just
above
the
spot
where
the
sun
had
set
hours
before
the
trees
standing
out
with
a
blackness
and
distinctness
never
seen
by
day
appeared
to
watch
for
me
and
look
after
me
as
i
rode
along
forming
an
avenue
of
silent
but
very
stately
spectators
and
to
my
fancy
for
my
fancy
was
highly
excited
that
night
the
rustling
of
the
young
leaves
upon
them
whispered
the
name
of
olivia
the
of
my
mare
feet
upon
the
hard
roads
echoed
the
name
olivia
olivia
i
turned
off
the
road
to
got
nearer
the
sea
and
rode
along
sandy
lanes
with
banks
of
turf
instead
of
which
were
covered
thickly
with
pale
primroses
shining
with
the
same
hue
as
the
moon
above
them
as
i
passed
the
scattered
cottages
here
and
there
a
dog
yapped
a
shrill
snarling
hark
and
woke
the
birds
till
they
gave
a
sleepy
twitter
in
their
new
nests
now
and
then
i
came
in
full
sight
of
the
sea
glittering
in
the
silvery
light
i
crossed
the
head
of
a
gorge
and
stopped
for
a
while
to
gaze
down
it
till
my
flesh
crept
it
was
not
more
than
a
few
yards
in
breadth
but
it
was
of
unknown
depth
and
the
rocks
stood
above
it
with
a
thick
heavy
blackness
the
tide
was
rushing
into
its
narrow
channel
with
a
thunder
which
throbbed
like
a
pulse
yet
in
the
intervals
of
its
pulsation
i
could
catch
the
thin
prattling
tinkle
of
a
brook
running
merrily
down
the
gorge
to
plunge
headlong
into
the
sea
round
every
spar
of
the
crags
and
over
every
islet
of
rock
the
foam
played
ceaselessly
breaking
over
them
like
drifts
of
snow
forever
melting
and
forever
forming
again
i
kept
on
my
way
as
near
the
sea
as
i
i
could
past
the
sleeping
cottages
and
hamlets
round
through
pierre
du
bois
and
torteval
with
the
gleaming
out
on
the
hanways
and
by
rocquaine
bay
and
vazon
bay
and
through
the
vale
to
captain
carey
peaceful
house
where
perhaps
night
nay
this
day
night
julia
might
be
weeping
and
wailing
i
had
made
the
circuit
of
our
island
a
place
so
dear
to
me
that
it
seemed
scarcely
possible
to
live
elsewhere
yet
i
should
be
forced
to
live
elsewhere
i
knew
that
with
a
clear
distinctness
there
could
be
no
home
for
me
in
guernsey
when
my
conduct
toward
julia
should
become
known
but
now
sark
which
had
been
behind
me
all
my
ride
lay
full
in
sight
and
the
eastern
sky
behind
it
began
to
quicken
with
new
light
the
gulls
were
rousing
themselves
and
flying
out
to
sea
with
their
plaintive
cries
and
the
larks
were
singing
their
first
sleepy
notes
to
the
coming
day
as
the
sun
rose
sark
looked
very
near
and
the
sea
a
plain
of
silvery
blue
seemed
solid
and
firm
enough
to
afford
me
a
road
across
to
it
a
white
mist
lay
like
a
huge
in
hazy
broad
curves
over
the
havre
gosselin
with
sharp
peaks
of
cliffs
piercing
through
olivia
was
sleeping
yonder
behind
that
veil
of
shining
mist
and
dear
as
guernsey
was
to
me
she
was
a
hundredfold
dearer
but
my
night
ride
bad
not
made
my
day
task
any
easier
for
me
no
new
light
had
dawned
upon
my
difficulty
there
was
no
for
me
to
escape
from
the
most
painful
and
perplexing
strait
i
had
ever
been
in
how
was
i
to
break
it
to
julia
and
when
it
was
quite
plain
to
me
that
the
sooner
it
was
over
the
better
it
would
be
for
myself
and
perhaps
the
better
for
her
how
was
i
to
go
through
my
morning
calls
in
the
state
of
nervous
anxiety
i
found
myself
in
i
resolved
to
have
it
over
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
finished
and
my
father
had
gone
to
make
his
professional
toilet
a
lengthy
and
important
duty
with
him
yet
when
breakfast
came
i
was
listening
intently
for
some
summons
which
would
give
me
an
hour
grace
from
fulfilling
my
own
determination
i
prolonged
my
meal
keeping
my
mother
in
her
place
at
the
table
for
she
had
never
given
up
her
office
of
pouring
out
my
tea
and
coffee
i
finished
at
list
and
still
no
urgent
message
had
come
for
me
my
mother
left
us
together
alone
as
her
custom
was
for
what
time
i
had
to
spare
a
variable
quantity
always
with
me
now
was
the
dreaded
moment
but
how
was
i
to
begin
julia
was
so
calm
and
unsuspecting
in
what
words
could
i
convey
my
fatal
meaning
most
gently
to
her
my
head
throbbed
and
i
could
not
raise
my
eyes
to
her
face
yet
it
must
be
done
dear
julia
i
said
in
as
firm
a
voice
as
i
could
command
yes
martin
but
just
then
grace
the
housemaid
knocked
emphatically
at
the
door
and
after
a
due
pause
entered
with
a
smiling
significant
face
yet
with
an
apologetic
courtesy
if
you
please
martin
she
said
i
very
sorry
but
baby
is
taken
with
and
they
want
you
to
go
as
fast
as
ever
you
can
please
sir
was
i
sorry
or
glad
i
could
not
tell
it
was
a
reprieve
but
then
i
knew
positively
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
reprieve
the
sentence
must
be
executed
julia
came
to
me
bent
her
cheek
toward
me
and
i
kissed
it
that
was
our
usual
salutation
when
our
morning
interview
was
ended
i
am
going
down
to
the
new
house
she
said
i
lost
a
good
deal
of
time
yesterday
and
i
must
make
up
for
it
shall
you
be
passing
by
at
any
time
martin
yes
no
i
can
not
tell
exactly
i
stammered
if
you
are
passing
come
in
for
a
few
minutes
she
answered
i
have
a
thousand
things
to
speak
to
you
about
shall
you
come
in
to
lunch
i
asked
no
i
shall
take
something
with
me
she
replied
it
hinders
so
coming
back
here
i
was
not
overworked
that
morning
the
convulsions
of
lihou
baby
were
not
at
all
serious
and
as
i
have
before
stated
the
practice
which
my
father
and
i
shared
between
us
was
a
very
limited
one
my
part
of
it
naturally
fell
among
our
poorer
patients
who
did
not
expect
me
to
waste
their
time
and
my
own
by
making
numerous
or
prolonged
visits
so
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
call
upon
julia
at
the
new
house
but
i
could
not
summon
sufficient
courage
the
morning
slipped
away
while
i
was
loitering
about
fort
george
and
chatting
carelessly
with
the
officers
quartered
there
i
went
to
lunch
pretty
sure
of
finding
no
one
but
my
mother
at
home
there
was
no
fear
of
losing
her
love
if
every
other
friend
turned
me
the
cold
shoulder
as
i
was
morally
certain
they
would
with
no
blame
to
themselves
but
the
very
depth
and
constancy
of
her
affection
made
it
the
more
difficult
and
the
more
terrible
for
me
to
wound
her
she
had
endured
so
much
poor
mother
and
was
looking
so
wan
and
pale
if
it
had
not
been
for
johanna
threat
i
should
have
resolved
to
say
nothing
about
olivia
and
to
run
my
chance
of
matrimonial
happiness
what
a
cruel
turn
fate
had
done
me
when
it
sent
me
across
the
sea
to
sark
ten
weeks
ago
my
mother
was
full
of
melancholy
merriment
that
morning
making
pathetic
little
jokes
about
julia
and
me
and
laughing
at
them
heartily
herself
short
bursts
of
laughter
which
left
her
paler
than
she
had
been
before
i
tried
to
laugh
myself
in
order
to
encourage
her
brief
playfulness
though
the
effort
almost
choked
me
before
i
went
out
again
i
sat
beside
her
for
a
few
minutes
with
my
head
which
ached
awfully
by
this
time
resting
on
her
dear
shoulder
mother
i
said
you
are
very
fond
of
julia
i
love
her
just
the
same
as
if
she
were
my
daughter
martin
as
she
will
be
soon
she
answered
do
you
love
her
as
much
as
me
i
asked
jealous
boy
she
said
laying
her
hand
on
my
hot
forehead
no
not
half
as
much
not
a
quarter
not
a
tenth
part
as
much
does
that
content
you
suppose
something
should
prevent
our
marriage
i
suggested
but
nothing
can
she
interrupted
and
o
martin
i
am
sure
you
will
be
very
happy
with
julia
i
said
no
more
for
i
did
not
dare
to
tell
her
yet
but
i
wished
i
had
spoken
to
her
about
olivia
instead
of
hiding
her
name
and
all
belonging
to
her
in
my
inmost
heart
my
mother
would
know
all
quite
soon
enough
unless
julia
and
i
agreed
to
keep
it
secret
and
let
things
go
on
as
they
were
if
julia
said
she
would
marry
me
knowing
that
i
was
heart
and
soul
in
love
with
another
woman
why
then
i
would
go
through
with
it
and
my
mother
need
never
hear
a
word
about
my
dilemma
julia
must
decide
my
lot
my
honor
was
pledged
to
her
and
if
she
insisted
upon
the
fulfilment
of
my
engagement
to
her
well
of
course
i
would
fulfil
it
i
went
down
reluctantly
at
length
to
the
new
house
but
it
was
at
almost
the
last
hour
the
had
already
struck
four
and
i
knew
johanna
would
be
true
to
her
time
and
drive
up
the
grange
at
five
i
left
a
message
with
my
mother
for
her
telling
her
where
she
would
find
julia
and
me
then
doggedly
but
sick
at
heart
with
myself
and
all
the
world
i
went
down
to
meet
my
doom
it
was
getting
into
nice
order
this
new
house
of
ours
we
had
had
six
months
to
prepare
it
in
and
to
fit
it
up
exactly
to
our
minds
and
it
was
as
near
my
ideal
of
a
pleasant
home
as
our
conflicting
tastes
permitted
perhaps
this
was
the
last
time
i
should
cross
its
threshold
there
was
a
pang
in
the
thought
this
was
my
position
if
julia
listened
to
my
avowal
angrily
and
renounced
me
indignantly
passionately
i
lost
fortune
position
profession
my
home
and
friends
with
the
sole
exception
of
my
mother
i
should
be
regarded
alternately
as
a
dupe
and
a
scoundrel
guernsey
would
become
too
hot
to
hold
me
and
i
should
be
forced
to
follow
my
luck
in
some
foreign
land
if
on
the
other
hand
julia
clung
to
me
and
would
not
give
me
up
trusting
to
time
to
change
my
feelings
then
i
lost
olivia
and
to
lose
her
seemed
the
worse
fate
of
the
two
julia
was
sitting
alone
in
the
which
overlooked
the
harbor
and
the
group
of
islands
across
the
channel
there
was
no
fear
of
interruption
no
callers
to
ring
the
bell
and
break
in
upon
our
it
was
an
understood
thing
that
at
present
only
most
intimate
friends
had
been
admitted
into
our
new
house
and
then
by
special
invitation
alone
there
was
a
very
happy
very
placid
expression
on
her
face
every
harsh
line
seemed
softened
and
a
pleased
smile
played
about
her
lips
her
dress
was
one
of
those
simple
fresh
clean
muslin
gowns
with
knots
of
ribbon
about
it
which
make
a
plain
woman
almost
pretty
and
a
pretty
woman
bewitching
her
dark
hair
looked
less
prim
and
neat
than
usual
she
pretended
not
to
hear
me
open
the
door
but
as
i
stood
still
at
the
threshold
gazing
at
her
she
lifted
up
her
head
with
a
very
pleasant
smile
i
am
very
glad
you
are
come
my
dear
martin
she
said
softly
chapter
the
seventeenth
a
long
i
dared
not
dally
another
moment
i
must
take
my
plunge
at
once
into
the
waters
i
have
something
of
importance
to
say
to
you
dear
cousin
i
began
so
have
i
she
said
gayly
a
thousand
things
as
i
told
you
this
morning
sir
though
you
are
so
late
in
coming
to
hear
them
see
i
have
been
making
a
list
of
a
few
commissions
for
you
to
do
in
london
they
are
such
as
i
can
trust
to
you
but
for
plate
and
glass
and
china
i
think
we
had
better
wait
till
we
return
from
switzerland
we
are
sure
to
come
home
through
london
her
eyes
ran
over
a
paper
she
was
holding
in
her
hand
while
i
stood
opposite
to
her
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
myself
and
feeling
the
guiltiest
wretch
alive
can
not
you
find
a
seat
she
asked
after
a
short
silence
i
sat
down
on
the
broad
instead
of
on
the
chair
close
to
hers
she
looked
up
at
that
and
fixed
her
eyes
upon
me
keenly
i
had
often
quailed
before
julia
gaze
as
a
boy
but
never
as
i
did
now
well
what
is
it
she
asked
curtly
the
incisiveness
of
her
tone
brought
life
into
me
as
a
probe
sometimes
brings
a
patient
out
of
stupor
julia
i
said
are
you
quite
sure
you
love
me
enough
to
be
happy
with
me
as
my
wife
she
opened
her
eyes
very
widely
and
arched
her
eyebrows
at
the
question
laughed
a
little
and
then
drooped
her
head
over
the
work
in
her
hands
think
of
it
well
julia
i
urged
i
know
you
well
enough
to
be
as
happy
as
the
day
is
long
with
you
she
replied
the
color
rushing
to
her
face
i
have
no
vocation
for
a
single
life
such
as
so
many
of
the
girls
here
have
to
make
up
their
minds
to
i
should
hate
to
have
nothing
to
do
and
nobody
to
care
for
every
night
and
morning
i
thank
god
that
he
has
ordained
another
life
for
me
he
knows
how
i
love
you
martin
what
was
i
to
say
to
this
how
was
i
to
set
my
foot
down
to
crush
this
blooming
happiness
of
hers
you
do
not
often
look
as
if
you
loved
me
i
said
at
last
that
is
only
my
way
she
answered
i
ca
be
soft
and
purring
like
many
women
i
do
care
to
be
always
kissing
and
hanging
about
anybody
but
if
you
are
afraid
i
do
love
you
enough
well
i
will
ask
you
what
you
think
in
ten
years
time
what
would
you
say
if
i
told
you
i
had
once
loved
a
girl
better
than
i
do
you
i
asked
that
not
true
she
said
sharply
i
known
you
all
your
life
and
you
could
not
hide
such
a
thing
from
your
mother
and
me
you
are
only
laughing
at
me
martin
heaven
knows
i
not
laughing
i
answered
solemnly
it
no
laughing
matter
julia
there
is
a
girl
i
love
better
than
you
even
now
the
color
and
the
smile
faded
out
of
her
face
leaving
it
ashy
pale
her
lips
parted
once
or
twice
but
her
voice
failed
her
then
she
broke
out
into
a
short
hysterical
laugh
you
are
talking
nonsense
dear
martin
she
gasped
you
ought
not
i
am
not
very
strong
get
me
a
glass
of
water
i
fetched
a
glass
of
water
from
the
kitchen
for
the
servant
who
had
been
at
work
had
gone
home
and
we
were
quite
alone
in
the
house
when
i
returned
her
face
was
still
working
with
nervous
twitchings
martin
you
ought
not
she
repeated
after
she
had
swallowed
some
water
tell
me
it
is
a
joke
directly
i
can
not
i
replied
painfully
and
sorrowfully
it
is
the
truth
though
i
would
almost
rather
face
death
than
own
it
i
love
you
dearly
julia
but
i
love
another
woman
better
god
help
us
both
there
was
dead
silence
in
the
room
after
those
words
i
could
not
hear
julia
breathe
or
move
and
i
could
not
look
at
her
my
eyes
were
turned
toward
the
window
and
the
islands
across
the
sea
purple
and
hazy
in
the
distance
leave
me
she
said
after
a
very
long
stillness
go
away
martin
i
can
not
leave
you
alone
i
exclaimed
no
i
will
not
julia
let
me
tell
you
more
let
me
explain
it
all
you
ought
to
know
every
thing
now
go
away
she
repeated
in
a
slow
mechanical
tone
i
hesitated
still
seeing
her
white
and
trembling
with
her
eyes
glassy
and
fixed
but
she
motioned
me
from
her
toward
the
door
and
her
pale
lips
parted
again
to
reiterate
her
command
how
i
crossed
that
room
i
do
not
know
but
the
moment
after
i
had
closed
the
door
i
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
i
dared
not
quit
the
house
and
leave
her
alone
in
such
a
state
and
i
longed
ardently
to
hear
the
clocks
chime
five
and
the
sound
of
johanna
wheels
on
the
street
she
could
not
be
here
yet
for
a
full
for
she
had
to
go
up
to
our
house
in
the
grange
road
and
come
back
again
what
if
julia
should
have
fainted
or
be
dead
that
was
one
of
the
longest
in
my
life
i
stood
at
the
watching
and
waiting
and
nodding
to
people
who
passed
by
and
who
simpered
at
me
in
the
most
inane
fashion
the
fools
i
called
them
to
myself
at
length
johanna
turned
the
corner
and
her
came
rattling
cheerfully
over
the
large
round
stones
i
ran
to
meet
her
for
heaven
sake
go
to
julia
i
cried
i
have
told
her
and
what
does
she
say
asked
johanna
not
a
word
not
a
syllable
i
replied
except
to
bid
me
go
away
she
has
locked
herself
into
the
then
you
had
better
go
away
altogether
she
said
and
leave
me
to
deal
with
her
do
come
in
and
then
i
can
say
you
are
not
here
a
friend
of
mine
lived
in
the
opposite
house
and
though
i
knew
he
was
not
at
home
i
knocked
at
his
door
and
asked
permission
to
sit
for
a
while
in
his
parlor
the
windows
looked
into
the
street
and
there
i
sat
watching
the
doors
of
our
new
house
for
johanna
and
julia
to
come
out
no
man
likes
to
be
ordered
out
of
sight
as
if
he
were
a
vagabond
or
a
criminal
and
i
felt
myself
aggrieved
and
miserable
at
length
the
door
opposite
opened
and
julia
appeared
her
face
completely
hidden
behind
a
veil
johanna
helped
her
into
the
low
carriage
as
if
she
had
been
an
invalid
and
paid
her
those
minute
trivial
attentions
which
one
woman
showers
upon
another
when
she
is
in
great
grief
then
they
drove
off
and
were
soon
out
of
my
sight
by
this
time
our
was
near
and
i
knew
my
mother
would
be
looking
out
for
us
both
i
was
thankful
to
find
at
the
table
a
visitor
who
had
dropped
in
unexpectedly
one
of
my
father
patients
a
widow
with
a
high
color
a
loud
voice
and
boisterous
spirits
who
kept
up
a
rattle
of
conversation
with
dobrée
my
mother
glanced
anxiously
at
me
very
often
but
she
could
say
little
where
is
julia
she
had
inquired
as
we
sat
down
to
dinner
without
her
julia
i
said
quite
absently
oh
she
is
gone
to
the
vale
with
johanna
carey
will
she
come
back
asked
my
mother
not
i
said
aloud
but
to
myself
i
added
nor
for
many
nights
to
come
never
most
probably
while
i
am
under
this
roof
we
have
been
building
our
house
upon
the
sand
and
the
floods
have
come
and
the
winds
have
blown
and
the
house
has
fallen
but
my
mother
knows
nothing
of
the
catastrophe
yet
if
it
were
possible
to
keep
her
ignorant
of
it
but
that
could
not
be
she
read
trouble
in
my
face
as
clearly
as
one
sees
a
in
the
sky
and
she
could
not
rest
till
she
had
fathomed
it
after
she
and
our
guest
had
left
us
my
father
lingered
only
a
few
minutes
he
was
not
a
man
that
cared
for
drinking
much
wine
with
no
companion
but
me
and
he
soon
pushed
the
decanters
from
him
you
are
as
dull
as
a
beetle
martin
he
said
i
think
i
will
go
and
see
how
your
mother
and
murray
get
along
together
he
went
his
way
and
i
went
mine
up
into
my
own
room
where
i
should
be
alone
to
think
over
things
it
was
a
pleasant
room
and
had
been
mine
from
my
boyhood
there
were
some
ugly
old
pictures
still
hanging
against
the
walls
which
i
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
take
down
the
model
of
a
ship
i
had
carved
with
my
penknife
the
sails
of
which
had
been
made
by
julia
occupied
the
top
shelf
over
my
books
the
first
pistol
i
had
ever
possessed
lay
on
the
same
shelf
it
was
my
own
den
my
nest
my
sanctuary
my
home
within
the
home
i
could
not
think
of
myself
being
quite
at
home
anywhere
else
of
late
i
had
been
awakened
in
the
night
two
or
three
times
and
found
my
mother
standing
at
my
bedside
with
her
thin
transparent
fingers
shading
the
light
from
my
eyes
when
i
remonstrated
with
her
she
had
kissed
me
smoothed
the
clothes
about
me
and
promised
meekly
to
go
back
to
bed
did
she
visit
me
every
night
and
would
there
come
a
time
when
she
could
not
visit
me
chapter
the
eighteenth
broken
off
as
i
asked
myself
this
question
with
an
unerring
premonition
that
the
time
would
soon
come
when
my
mother
and
i
would
be
separated
i
heard
her
tapping
lightly
at
the
door
she
was
not
in
the
habit
of
leaving
her
guests
and
i
was
surprised
and
perplexed
at
seeing
her
your
father
and
murray
are
having
a
game
of
chess
she
said
answering
my
look
of
astonishment
we
can
be
alone
together
half
an
hour
and
now
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
there
is
something
going
wrong
with
you
she
sank
down
weariedly
into
a
chair
and
i
knelt
down
beside
her
it
was
almost
harder
to
tell
her
than
to
tell
julia
but
it
was
worse
than
useless
to
put
off
the
evil
moment
better
for
her
to
hear
all
from
me
before
a
whisper
reached
her
from
any
one
else
johanna
came
here
she
continued
with
a
face
as
grave
as
a
judge
and
asked
for
julia
in
a
melancholy
voice
has
there
been
any
quarrel
between
you
two
she
was
accustomed
to
our
small
quarrels
and
to
setting
them
right
again
for
we
were
prone
to
quarrel
in
a
cousinly
fashion
without
much
real
bitterness
on
either
side
but
with
such
an
intimate
and
irritating
knowledge
of
each
other
weak
points
that
we
needed
a
at
hand
mother
i
am
not
going
to
marry
my
cousin
julia
i
said
so
i
have
heard
before
she
answered
with
a
faint
smile
come
come
martin
it
is
too
late
to
talk
boyish
nonsense
like
this
but
i
love
somebody
else
i
said
warmly
for
my
heart
throbbed
at
the
thought
of
olivia
and
i
told
julia
so
this
afternoon
it
is
broken
off
for
good
now
mother
she
gave
me
no
answer
and
i
looked
up
into
her
dear
face
in
alarm
it
had
grown
rigid
and
a
peculiar
blue
tinge
of
pallor
was
spreading
over
it
her
head
had
fallen
back
against
the
chair
i
had
never
seen
her
look
so
in
any
of
her
illnesses
and
i
sprang
to
my
feet
in
terror
she
stopped
me
by
a
slight
convulsive
pressure
of
her
hand
as
i
was
about
to
unfasten
her
brooch
and
open
her
dress
to
give
her
air
no
martin
she
whispered
i
shall
be
better
in
a
moment
but
it
was
several
minutes
before
she
breathed
freely
and
naturally
or
could
lift
up
her
head
then
she
did
not
look
at
me
but
lifted
up
her
eyes
to
the
pale
evening
sky
and
her
lips
quivered
with
agitation
martin
it
will
be
the
death
of
me
she
said
and
a
few
tears
stole
down
her
cheeks
which
i
wiped
away
it
shall
not
be
the
death
of
you
i
exclaimed
if
julia
is
willing
to
marry
me
knowing
the
whole
truth
i
am
ready
to
marry
her
for
your
sake
mother
i
would
do
any
thing
for
your
sake
but
johanna
said
she
ought
to
be
told
and
i
think
it
was
right
myself
who
is
it
who
can
it
be
that
you
love
she
asked
mother
i
said
i
wish
i
had
told
you
before
but
i
did
not
know
that
i
loved
the
girl
as
i
do
till
i
saw
her
yesterday
in
sark
and
captain
carey
charged
me
with
it
that
girl
she
cried
one
of
the
olliviers
o
martin
you
must
marry
in
your
own
class
that
was
a
mistake
i
answered
her
christian
name
is
olivia
i
do
not
know
what
her
surname
is
not
know
even
her
name
she
exclaimed
listen
mother
i
said
and
then
i
told
her
all
i
knew
about
olivia
and
drew
such
a
picture
of
her
as
i
had
seen
her
as
made
my
mother
smile
and
sigh
deeply
in
turns
but
she
may
be
an
adventuress
you
know
nothing
about
her
she
objected
surely
you
can
not
love
a
woman
you
do
not
esteem
esteem
i
repeated
i
never
thought
whether
i
esteemed
olivia
but
i
am
satisfied
i
love
her
you
may
be
quite
sure
she
is
no
adventuress
an
adventuress
would
not
hide
herself
in
tardif
cottage
a
girl
without
friends
and
without
a
name
she
sighed
a
runaway
from
her
family
and
home
it
does
not
look
well
martin
i
could
answer
nothing
and
it
would
be
of
little
use
to
try
i
saw
when
my
mother
prejudices
could
blind
her
to
love
any
one
not
of
our
own
caste
was
a
fatal
error
in
her
eyes
does
julia
know
all
this
she
asked
she
has
not
heard
a
word
about
olivia
i
answered
as
soon
as
i
told
her
i
loved
some
one
else
better
than
her
she
bade
me
begone
out
of
her
sight
she
has
not
an
amiable
temper
but
she
is
an
upright
conscientious
religious
woman
she
said
somewhat
angrily
she
would
never
have
run
away
from
her
friends
and
we
know
all
about
her
i
can
not
think
what
your
father
will
say
martin
it
has
given
him
more
pleasure
and
satisfaction
than
any
thing
that
has
happened
for
years
if
this
marriage
is
broken
off
it
upsets
every
thing
of
course
it
would
upset
every
thing
there
was
the
mischief
of
it
the
convulsion
would
be
so
great
that
i
felt
ready
to
marry
julia
in
order
to
avoid
it
supposing
she
would
marry
me
that
was
the
question
and
it
rested
solely
with
her
i
would
almost
rather
face
the
long
slow
weariness
of
an
unsuitable
marriage
than
encounter
the
immediate
results
of
the
breaking
off
of
our
engagement
just
on
the
eve
of
its
consummation
i
was
a
coward
no
doubt
but
events
had
hurried
me
on
too
rapidly
for
me
to
stand
still
and
consider
the
cost
o
martin
martin
wailed
my
poor
mother
breaking
down
again
suddenly
i
had
so
set
my
heart
upon
this
i
did
so
long
to
see
you
in
a
home
of
your
own
and
julia
was
so
generous
never
looking
as
if
all
the
money
was
hers
and
you
without
a
penny
what
is
to
become
of
you
now
my
boy
i
wish
i
had
been
dead
and
in
my
grave
before
this
had
happened
hush
mother
i
said
kneeling
down
again
beside
her
and
kissing
her
tenderly
it
is
still
in
julia
hands
if
she
will
marry
me
i
shall
marry
her
but
then
you
will
not
be
happy
she
said
with
fresh
sobs
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
contradict
that
i
felt
that
no
misery
would
be
equal
to
that
of
losing
olivia
but
i
did
my
best
to
comfort
my
mother
by
promising
to
see
julia
the
next
day
and
renew
my
engagement
if
possible
pray
may
i
be
informed
as
to
what
is
the
matter
now
broke
in
a
satirical
cutting
voice
the
voice
of
my
father
it
roused
us
both
my
mother
to
her
usual
mood
of
gentle
submission
and
me
to
the
chronic
state
of
irritation
which
his
presence
always
provoked
in
me
not
much
sir
i
answered
coldly
only
my
marriage
with
my
cousin
julia
is
broken
off
broken
off
he
ejaculated
broken
off
chapter
the
nineteenth
the
dobrées
good
name
my
father
florid
face
looked
almost
as
rigid
and
white
as
my
had
done
he
stood
in
the
doorway
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
for
it
had
grown
quite
dark
while
my
mother
and
i
were
talking
and
the
light
shone
full
upon
his
changed
face
his
hand
shook
violently
so
i
took
the
lamp
from
him
and
set
it
down
on
the
table
go
down
to
murray
he
said
turning
savagely
upon
my
mother
how
could
you
be
so
rude
as
to
leave
her
she
talks
of
going
away
let
her
go
as
soon
as
she
likes
i
shall
stay
here
with
martin
i
did
not
know
i
had
been
away
so
long
she
answered
meekly
and
looking
deprecatingly
from
the
one
to
the
other
of
you
will
not
quarrel
with
your
father
martin
if
i
leave
you
will
you
this
she
whispered
in
my
ear
in
a
beseeching
tone
not
if
i
can
help
it
mother
i
replied
also
in
a
whisper
now
confound
it
cried
dobrée
after
she
had
gone
slowly
and
reluctantly
and
looking
back
at
the
door
to
me
now
just
tell
me
shortly
all
about
this
nonsense
of
yours
i
thought
some
quarrel
was
up
when
julia
did
not
come
home
to
dinner
out
with
it
martin
as
i
said
before
there
is
not
much
to
tell
i
answered
i
was
compelled
in
honor
to
tell
julia
i
loved
another
woman
more
than
herself
and
i
presume
though
i
am
not
sure
she
will
decline
to
become
my
wife
in
love
with
another
woman
repeated
my
father
with
a
long
whistle
partly
of
sympathy
and
partly
of
perplexity
who
is
it
my
son
that
is
of
little
moment
i
said
having
no
desire
whatever
to
confide
the
story
to
him
the
main
point
is
that
it
true
and
i
told
julia
so
this
afternoon
good
gracious
martin
he
cried
what
accursed
folly
what
need
was
there
to
tell
her
of
any
little
peccadillo
if
you
could
conceal
it
why
did
you
not
come
to
me
for
advice
julia
is
a
prude
like
your
mother
it
will
not
be
easy
for
her
to
overlook
this
there
is
nothing
to
overlook
i
said
as
soon
as
i
knew
my
own
mind
i
told
her
honestly
about
it
at
that
moment
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
my
honesty
was
due
to
johanna
insistent
advice
i
believed
just
then
that
i
had
acted
from
the
impulse
of
my
own
sense
of
honor
and
the
belief
gave
my
words
and
tone
more
spirit
than
they
would
have
had
otherwise
my
father
face
grew
paler
and
graver
as
he
listened
he
looked
older
by
ten
years
than
he
had
done
an
hour
ago
in
the
i
do
understand
it
he
muttered
do
you
mean
that
this
is
a
serious
thing
are
you
in
love
with
some
girl
of
our
own
class
not
a
mere
passing
fancy
that
no
one
would
think
seriously
of
for
an
instant
just
a
trifling
that
it
is
no
use
telling
women
about
eh
i
could
make
allowance
for
that
martin
and
get
julia
to
do
the
same
come
it
can
not
be
any
thing
more
i
did
not
reply
to
him
here
we
had
come
he
and
i
to
the
very
barrier
that
had
been
growing
up
between
us
ever
since
i
had
first
discovered
my
mother
secret
and
wasting
grief
he
was
on
one
side
of
it
and
i
on
the
other
a
wall
of
separation
which
neither
of
us
could
leap
over
why
do
you
speak
martin
he
asked
testily
because
i
hate
the
subject
i
answered
when
i
told
julia
i
loved
another
woman
i
meant
that
some
one
else
occupied
that
place
in
my
affection
which
belonged
rightfully
to
my
wife
and
so
julia
understood
it
then
he
cried
with
a
gesture
of
despair
i
am
a
ruined
man
his
consternation
and
dismay
were
so
real
that
they
startled
me
yet
knowing
what
a
consummate
actor
he
was
i
restrained
both
my
fear
and
my
sympathy
and
waited
for
him
to
enlighten
me
further
he
sat
with
his
head
bowed
and
his
hands
hanging
down
in
an
attitude
of
profound
despondency
so
different
from
his
usual
jaunty
air
that
every
moment
increased
my
anxiety
what
can
it
have
to
do
with
you
i
asked
after
a
long
pause
i
am
a
ruined
and
disgraced
man
he
reiterated
without
looking
up
if
you
have
broken
off
your
marriage
with
julia
i
shall
never
raise
my
head
again
but
why
i
asked
uneasily
come
down
into
my
he
said
after
another
pause
of
deliberation
i
went
on
before
him
carrying
the
lamp
and
turning
round
once
or
twice
saw
his
face
look
gray
and
the
expression
of
it
vacant
and
troubled
his
was
a
luxurious
room
elegantly
furnished
and
with
several
pictures
on
the
walls
including
a
painted
photograph
of
himself
taken
recently
by
the
first
photographer
in
guernsey
there
were
containing
a
number
of
the
best
medical
works
behind
which
lay
out
of
sight
a
numerous
selection
of
french
novels
more
thumbed
than
the
ponderous
volumes
in
front
he
sank
down
into
an
shivering
as
if
we
were
in
the
depth
of
winter
martin
i
am
a
ruined
man
he
said
for
the
third
time
but
how
i
asked
again
impatiently
for
my
fears
were
growing
strong
certainly
he
was
not
acting
a
part
this
time
i
dare
not
tell
you
he
cried
leaning
his
head
upon
his
desk
and
sobbing
how
white
his
hair
was
and
how
aged
he
looked
i
recollected
how
he
used
to
play
with
me
when
i
was
a
boy
and
carry
me
before
him
on
horseback
as
long
back
as
i
could
remember
my
heart
softened
and
warmed
to
him
as
it
had
not
done
for
years
father
i
said
if
you
can
trust
any
one
you
can
trust
me
if
you
are
ruined
and
disgraced
i
shall
be
the
same
as
your
son
that
true
he
answered
that
true
it
will
bring
disgrace
on
you
and
your
mother
we
shall
be
forced
to
leave
guernsey
where
she
has
lived
all
her
life
and
it
will
be
the
death
of
her
martin
you
must
save
us
all
by
making
it
up
with
julia
but
why
i
demanded
once
more
i
must
know
what
you
mean
mean
he
said
turning
upon
me
angrily
you
blockhead
i
mean
that
unless
you
marry
julia
i
shall
have
to
give
an
account
of
her
property
and
i
could
not
make
all
square
not
if
i
sold
every
stick
and
stone
i
possess
i
sat
silent
for
a
time
trying
to
take
in
this
piece
of
information
he
had
been
julia
guardian
ever
since
she
was
left
an
orphan
ten
years
old
but
i
had
never
known
that
there
had
not
been
a
formal
and
legal
settlement
of
her
affairs
when
she
was
of
age
our
family
name
had
no
blot
upon
it
it
was
one
of
the
most
honored
names
in
the
island
but
if
this
came
to
light
then
the
disgrace
would
be
dark
indeed
can
you
tell
me
all
about
it
i
asked
my
father
after
making
his
confession
settled
himself
in
his
chair
comfortably
appearing
to
feel
that
he
had
begun
to
make
reparation
for
the
wrong
his
temperament
was
more
buoyant
than
mine
selfish
natures
are
often
buoyant
it
would
take
a
long
time
he
said
and
it
would
be
a
deuse
of
a
nuisance
you
make
it
up
with
julia
and
marry
her
as
you
bound
to
do
of
course
you
will
manage
all
her
money
when
you
are
her
husband
as
you
will
be
now
you
know
all
but
i
do
know
all
i
replied
and
i
insist
upon
doing
so
before
i
make
up
my
mind
what
to
do
i
believe
he
expected
this
opposition
from
me
for
otherwise
all
he
had
said
could
have
been
said
in
my
room
but
after
feebly
giving
battle
on
various
points
and
staving
off
sundry
inquiries
he
opened
a
drawer
in
one
of
his
cabinets
and
produced
a
number
of
deeds
scrip
belonging
to
julia
for
two
hours
i
was
busy
with
his
accounts
once
or
twice
he
tried
to
slink
out
of
the
room
but
that
i
would
not
suffer
at
length
the
ornamental
clock
on
his
struck
eleven
and
he
made
another
effort
to
beat
a
retreat
do
not
go
away
till
every
thing
is
clear
i
said
is
this
all
all
he
repeated
is
it
enough
between
three
and
four
thousand
pounds
deficient
i
answered
it
is
quite
enough
enough
to
make
me
a
felon
he
said
if
julia
chooses
to
prosecute
me
i
think
it
is
highly
probable
i
replied
though
i
know
nothing
of
the
law
then
you
see
clearly
martin
there
is
no
alternative
but
for
you
to
marry
her
and
keep
our
secret
i
have
reckoned
upon
this
for
years
and
your
mother
and
i
have
been
of
one
mind
in
bringing
it
about
if
you
marry
julia
her
affairs
go
direct
from
my
hands
to
yours
and
we
are
all
safe
if
you
break
with
her
she
will
leave
us
and
demand
an
account
of
my
guardianship
and
your
name
and
mine
will
be
branded
in
our
own
island
that
is
very
clear
i
said
sullenly
your
mother
would
not
survive
it
he
continued
with
a
solemn
accent
oh
i
have
been
threatened
with
that
already
i
exclaimed
very
bitterly
pray
does
my
mother
know
of
this
disgraceful
business
heaven
forbid
he
cried
your
mother
is
a
good
woman
martin
as
simple
as
a
dove
you
ought
to
think
of
her
before
you
consign
us
all
to
shame
i
can
quit
guernsey
i
am
an
old
man
and
it
signifies
very
little
where
i
lie
down
to
die
i
have
not
been
as
good
a
husband
as
i
might
have
been
but
i
could
not
face
her
after
she
knows
this
poor
mary
my
poor
poor
love
i
believe
she
cares
enough
for
me
still
to
break
her
heart
over
it
then
i
am
to
be
your
i
said
you
are
my
son
he
answered
and
religion
itself
teaches
us
that
the
sins
of
the
fathers
are
visited
on
the
children
i
leave
the
matter
in
your
hands
but
only
answer
one
question
could
you
show
your
face
among
your
own
friends
if
this
were
known
i
knew
very
well
i
could
not
my
father
a
fraudulent
steward
of
property
then
farewell
forever
to
all
that
had
made
my
life
happy
we
were
a
proud
family
proud
of
our
rank
and
of
our
pure
blood
above
all
of
our
honor
which
had
never
been
tarnished
by
a
breath
i
could
not
yet
bear
to
believe
that
my
father
was
a
rogue
he
himself
was
not
so
lost
to
shame
that
he
could
meet
my
eye
i
saw
there
was
no
escape
from
it
i
must
marry
julia
well
i
said
at
last
as
you
say
the
matter
is
in
my
hands
now
and
i
must
make
the
best
of
it
sir
without
a
light
i
went
up
to
my
own
room
where
the
moon
that
had
shone
upon
me
in
my
last
night
ride
was
gleaming
brightly
through
the
window
i
intended
to
reflect
and
deliberate
but
i
was
worn
out
i
flung
myself
down
on
the
bed
but
could
not
have
remained
awake
for
a
single
moment
i
fell
into
a
deep
sleep
which
lasted
till
morning
chapter
the
twentieth
two
letters
when
i
awoke
my
poor
mother
was
sitting
beside
me
looking
very
ill
and
sorrowful
she
had
slipped
a
pillow
under
my
head
and
thrown
a
shawl
across
me
i
got
up
with
a
bewildered
brain
and
a
general
sense
of
calamity
which
i
could
not
clearly
define
martin
she
said
your
father
has
gone
by
this
morning
boat
to
jersey
he
says
you
know
why
but
he
has
left
this
note
for
you
why
have
you
not
been
in
bed
last
night
never
mind
mother
i
answered
as
i
tore
open
the
note
which
was
carefully
sealed
with
my
father
private
seal
he
had
written
it
immediately
after
i
left
him
my
son
morning
i
shall
run
over
to
jersey
for
a
few
days
until
this
sad
business
of
yours
is
settled
i
can
not
bear
to
meet
your
changed
face
you
make
no
allowances
for
your
father
half
my
expenses
have
been
incurred
in
educating
you
you
ought
to
consider
this
and
that
you
owe
more
to
me
as
your
father
than
to
any
one
else
but
in
these
days
parents
receive
little
honor
from
their
children
when
all
is
settled
write
to
me
at
prince
hotel
it
rests
upon
you
whether
i
ever
see
guernsey
again
your
wretched
father
richard
dobrée
can
i
see
it
asked
my
mother
holding
out
her
hand
no
never
mind
seeing
it
i
answered
it
is
about
julia
you
know
it
would
only
trouble
you
captain
carey
man
brought
a
letter
from
julia
just
now
she
said
taking
it
from
her
pocket
he
said
there
was
no
answer
her
eyelids
were
still
red
from
weeping
and
her
voice
faltered
as
if
she
might
break
out
into
sobs
any
moment
i
took
the
letter
from
her
but
i
did
not
open
it
you
want
to
be
alone
to
read
it
she
said
o
martin
if
you
can
change
your
mind
and
save
us
all
from
this
trouble
do
it
for
my
sake
if
i
can
i
will
i
answered
but
every
thing
is
very
hard
upon
me
mother
she
could
not
guess
how
hard
and
if
i
could
help
it
she
should
never
know
now
i
was
fully
awake
the
enormity
of
my
father
dishonesty
and
his
extreme
egotism
weighed
heavily
upon
me
i
could
not
view
his
conduct
in
a
fairer
light
than
i
had
done
in
my
amazement
the
night
before
it
grew
blacker
as
i
dwelt
upon
it
and
now
he
was
off
to
jersey
shirking
the
disagreeable
consequences
of
his
own
delinquency
i
knew
how
he
would
spend
his
time
there
jersey
is
no
retreat
for
the
penitent
as
soon
as
my
mother
was
gone
i
opened
julia
letter
it
began
my
dear
martin
i
know
all
now
johanna
has
told
me
when
you
spoke
to
me
so
hurriedly
and
unexpectedly
this
afternoon
i
could
not
bear
to
hear
another
word
but
now
i
am
calm
and
i
can
think
it
all
over
quite
quietly
it
is
an
infatuation
martin
johanna
says
so
as
well
as
i
and
she
is
never
wrong
it
is
a
sheer
impossibility
that
you
in
your
sober
senses
should
love
a
strange
person
whose
very
name
you
do
not
know
better
than
you
do
me
your
cousin
your
sister
your
whom
you
have
known
all
your
life
and
loved
i
am
quite
sure
of
that
with
a
very
true
affection
it
vexes
me
to
write
about
that
person
in
any
connection
with
yourself
emma
spoke
of
her
in
her
last
letter
from
sark
not
at
all
in
reference
to
you
however
she
is
so
completely
of
a
lower
class
that
it
would
never
enter
emma
head
that
you
could
see
any
thing
in
her
she
said
there
was
a
rumor
afloat
that
tardif
was
about
to
marry
the
girl
you
had
been
attending
and
that
everybody
in
the
island
regretted
it
she
said
it
would
be
a
for
him
tardif
what
then
would
it
be
for
you
a
dobrée
no
it
is
a
delusion
an
infatuation
which
will
quickly
pass
away
i
can
not
believe
you
are
so
weak
as
to
be
taken
in
by
mere
prettiness
without
character
and
this
person
i
do
not
say
so
harshly
martin
has
no
character
no
name
were
you
free
you
could
not
marry
her
there
is
a
mystery
about
her
and
mystery
usually
means
shame
a
dobrée
could
not
make
an
adventuress
his
wife
then
you
have
seen
so
little
of
her
three
times
since
the
week
you
were
there
in
march
what
is
that
compared
to
the
years
we
have
spent
together
it
is
impossible
that
in
your
heart
of
hearts
you
should
love
her
more
than
me
i
have
been
trying
to
think
what
you
would
do
if
all
is
broken
off
between
us
we
could
not
keep
this
a
secret
in
guernsey
and
everybody
would
blame
you
i
will
not
ask
you
to
think
of
my
mortification
at
being
jilted
for
people
would
call
it
that
i
could
outlive
that
but
what
are
you
to
do
we
can
not
go
on
again
as
we
used
to
do
i
must
speak
plainly
about
it
your
practice
is
not
sufficient
to
maintain
the
family
in
a
proper
position
for
the
dobrées
and
if
i
go
to
live
alone
at
the
new
house
as
i
must
do
what
is
to
become
of
my
uncle
and
aunt
i
have
often
considered
this
and
have
been
glad
the
difficulty
was
settled
by
our
marriage
now
every
thing
will
be
unsettled
again
i
did
not
intend
to
say
any
thing
about
myself
but
o
martin
you
do
not
know
the
blank
that
it
will
be
to
me
i
have
been
so
happy
since
you
asked
me
to
be
your
wife
it
was
so
pleasant
to
think
that
i
should
live
all
my
life
in
guernsey
and
yet
not
be
doomed
to
the
empty
vacant
lot
of
an
unmarried
woman
you
think
that
perhaps
johanna
is
happy
single
she
is
content
good
women
ought
to
be
content
but
i
tell
you
i
would
gladly
exchange
her
contentment
for
aunt
dobrée
troubles
with
her
pride
and
happiness
in
you
i
have
seen
her
troubles
clearly
and
i
say
martin
i
would
give
all
johanna
calm
colorless
peace
for
her
delight
in
her
son
then
i
can
not
give
up
the
thought
of
our
home
just
finished
and
so
pretty
it
was
so
pleasant
this
afternoon
before
you
came
in
with
your
dreadful
i
was
thinking
what
a
good
wife
i
would
be
to
you
and
how
in
my
own
house
i
should
never
be
tempted
into
those
tiresome
tempers
you
have
seen
in
me
sometimes
it
was
your
father
often
who
made
me
angry
and
i
visited
it
upon
you
because
you
are
so
that
was
foolish
of
me
you
could
not
know
how
much
i
love
you
how
my
life
is
bound
up
in
you
or
you
would
have
been
proof
against
that
person
in
sark
i
think
it
right
to
tell
you
all
this
now
though
it
is
not
in
my
nature
to
make
professions
and
demonstrations
of
my
love
think
of
me
of
yourself
of
your
poor
mother
you
were
never
selfish
and
you
can
do
noble
things
i
do
not
say
it
would
be
noble
to
marry
me
but
it
would
be
a
noble
thing
to
conquer
an
ignoble
passion
how
could
martin
dobrée
fall
in
love
with
an
unknown
adventuress
i
shall
remain
in
the
house
all
day
and
if
you
can
come
to
see
me
feeling
that
this
has
been
a
dream
of
folly
from
which
you
have
awakened
i
will
not
ask
you
to
own
it
that
you
come
at
all
will
be
a
sign
to
me
that
you
wish
it
forgotten
and
blotted
out
between
us
as
if
it
had
never
been
with
true
deep
love
for
you
martin
believe
me
still
your
affectionate
julia
i
pondered
over
julia
letter
as
i
dressed
there
was
not
a
word
of
resentment
in
it
it
was
full
of
affectionate
thought
for
us
all
but
what
reasoning
i
had
not
known
olivia
so
long
as
i
had
known
her
therefore
i
could
not
love
her
as
truly
a
strange
therefore
i
had
scarcely
had
leisure
to
think
of
olivia
in
the
hurry
and
anxiety
of
the
last
hours
but
now
that
person
in
sark
the
unknown
adventuress
presented
itself
very
vividly
to
my
mind
know
her
i
felt
as
if
i
knew
every
tone
of
her
voice
and
every
expression
of
her
face
yet
i
longed
to
know
them
more
intimately
the
note
she
had
written
to
me
a
few
weeks
ago
i
could
repeat
word
for
word
and
the
handwriting
seemed
far
more
familiar
to
me
even
than
julia
there
was
no
doubt
my
love
for
her
was
very
different
from
my
affection
for
julia
and
if
it
was
an
infatuation
it
was
the
sweetest
most
exquisite
infatuation
that
could
ever
possess
me
yet
there
was
no
longer
any
hesitation
in
my
mind
as
to
what
i
must
do
julia
knew
all
now
i
had
told
her
distinctly
of
my
love
for
olivia
and
she
would
not
believe
it
she
appeared
wishful
to
hold
me
to
my
engagement
in
spite
of
it
at
any
rate
so
i
interpreted
her
letter
i
did
not
suppose
that
i
should
not
live
it
down
this
infatuation
as
they
chose
to
call
it
i
might
hunger
and
thirst
and
be
on
the
point
of
perishing
then
my
nature
would
turn
to
other
nutriment
and
assimilate
it
to
its
contracted
and
stultified
capacities
after
all
there
was
some
reason
in
the
objections
urged
against
olivia
the
dislike
of
all
insulated
people
against
foreigners
is
natural
enough
and
in
her
case
there
was
a
mystery
which
i
must
solve
before
i
could
think
of
asking
her
to
become
my
wife
ask
her
to
become
my
wife
that
was
impossible
now
i
had
chosen
my
wife
months
before
i
saw
her
i
went
mechanically
through
the
routine
of
my
morning
work
and
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
i
could
get
away
to
ride
to
the
vale
my
mother
knew
where
i
was
going
and
gazed
wistfully
into
my
face
but
without
otherwise
asking
me
any
questions
at
the
last
moment
as
i
touched
madam
bridle
i
looked
down
at
her
standing
on
the
cheer
up
mother
i
said
almost
gayly
it
will
all
come
right
chapter
the
all
wrong
by
this
time
you
know
that
i
could
not
ride
along
the
flat
open
shore
between
and
the
vale
without
having
a
good
sight
of
sark
though
it
lay
just
a
little
behind
me
it
was
not
in
human
nature
to
turn
my
back
doggedly
upon
it
i
had
never
seen
it
look
nearer
the
channel
between
us
scarcely
seemed
a
mile
across
the
old
windmill
above
the
havre
gosselin
stood
out
plainly
i
almost
fancied
that
but
for
breckhou
i
could
have
seen
tardif
house
where
my
darling
was
living
my
heart
leaped
at
the
mere
thought
of
it
then
i
shook
madam
bridle
about
her
neck
and
she
carried
me
on
at
a
sharp
canter
toward
captain
carey
residence
i
saw
julia
standing
at
a
window
gazing
down
the
long
white
road
which
runs
as
straight
as
an
arrow
through
the
braye
du
valle
to
common
she
must
have
seen
madam
and
me
half
a
mile
away
but
she
kept
her
post
motionless
as
a
sentinel
until
i
jumped
down
to
open
the
gate
then
she
vanished
the
was
at
the
door
by
the
time
i
reached
it
and
johanna
herself
was
on
the
threshold
with
her
hands
outstretched
and
her
face
radiant
i
was
as
welcome
as
the
prodigal
son
and
she
was
ready
to
fall
on
my
neck
and
kiss
me
i
felt
sure
of
you
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
trusted
to
your
good
sense
and
honor
and
they
have
not
failed
you
thank
god
you
are
come
julia
has
neither
ate
nor
slept
since
i
brought
her
here
she
led
me
to
her
own
private
where
i
found
julia
standing
by
the
fireplace
and
leaning
against
it
as
if
she
could
not
stand
alone
when
i
went
up
to
her
and
took
her
hand
she
flung
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
clung
to
me
in
a
passion
of
tears
it
was
some
minutes
before
she
could
recover
her
i
had
never
seen
her
abandon
herself
to
such
a
paroxysm
before
julia
my
poor
girl
i
said
i
did
not
think
you
would
take
it
so
much
to
heart
as
this
i
shall
come
all
right
directly
she
sobbed
sitting
down
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
johanna
said
you
would
come
but
i
was
not
sure
yes
i
am
here
i
answered
with
a
very
dreary
feeling
about
me
that
is
enough
said
julia
you
need
not
say
a
word
more
let
us
forget
it
both
of
us
you
will
only
give
me
your
promise
never
to
see
her
or
speak
to
her
again
it
might
be
a
fair
thing
for
her
to
ask
but
it
was
not
a
fair
thing
for
me
to
promise
olivia
had
told
me
she
had
no
friends
at
all
except
tardif
and
me
and
if
the
gossip
of
the
sark
people
drove
her
from
the
shelter
of
his
roof
i
should
be
her
only
resource
and
i
believed
she
would
come
frankly
to
me
for
help
olivia
quite
understands
about
my
engagement
to
you
i
said
i
told
her
at
once
that
we
were
going
to
be
married
and
that
i
hoped
she
would
find
a
friend
in
you
a
friend
in
me
martin
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
indignant
surprise
you
could
not
ask
me
to
be
that
not
now
i
suppose
i
replied
the
girl
is
as
innocent
and
blameless
as
any
girl
living
but
i
dare
say
you
would
sooner
befriend
the
most
jezebel
in
the
channel
islands
yes
i
would
she
said
an
innocent
girl
indeed
i
only
wish
she
had
been
killed
when
she
fell
from
the
cliff
hush
i
cried
shuddering
at
the
bare
mention
of
olivia
death
you
do
not
know
what
you
say
it
is
worse
than
useless
to
talk
about
her
i
came
to
ask
you
to
think
no
more
of
what
passed
between
us
yesterday
but
you
are
going
to
persist
in
your
infatuation
said
julia
you
can
never
deceive
me
i
know
you
too
well
oh
i
see
that
you
still
think
the
same
of
her
you
know
nothing
about
her
i
replied
and
i
shall
take
care
i
never
do
she
interrupted
spitefully
so
it
is
of
no
use
to
go
on
quarrelling
about
her
i
continued
taking
no
notice
of
the
interruption
i
made
up
my
mind
before
i
came
here
that
i
must
see
as
little
as
possible
of
her
for
the
future
you
must
understand
julia
she
has
never
given
me
a
particle
of
reason
to
suppose
she
loves
me
but
you
are
still
in
love
with
her
she
asked
i
stood
biting
my
nails
to
the
quick
a
trick
i
had
while
a
boy
but
one
that
had
been
broken
off
by
my
mother
and
julia
combined
vigilance
now
the
habit
came
back
upon
me
in
full
force
as
my
only
resource
from
speaking
martin
she
said
with
flashing
eyes
and
a
rising
tone
in
her
voice
which
like
the
first
shrill
moan
of
the
wind
presaged
a
storm
i
will
never
marry
you
until
you
can
say
on
your
word
of
honor
that
you
love
that
person
no
longer
and
are
ready
to
promise
to
hold
no
further
communication
with
her
oh
i
know
what
my
poor
aunt
has
had
to
endure
and
i
will
not
put
up
with
it
very
well
julia
i
answered
controlling
myself
as
well
as
i
could
i
have
only
one
more
word
to
say
on
this
subject
i
love
olivia
and
as
far
as
i
know
myself
i
shall
love
her
as
long
as
i
live
i
did
not
come
here
to
give
you
any
reason
for
supposing
my
mind
is
changed
as
to
her
if
you
consent
to
be
my
wife
i
will
do
my
best
god
helping
me
to
be
most
true
most
faithful
to
you
and
god
forbid
i
should
injure
olivia
in
thought
by
supposing
she
could
care
for
me
other
than
as
a
friend
but
my
motive
for
coming
now
is
to
tell
you
some
particulars
about
your
property
which
my
father
made
known
to
me
only
last
night
it
was
a
miserable
task
for
me
but
i
told
her
simply
the
painful
discovery
i
had
made
she
sat
listening
with
a
dark
and
sullen
face
but
betraying
not
a
spark
of
resentment
so
far
as
her
loss
of
fortune
was
concerned
yes
she
said
bitterly
when
i
had
finished
robbed
by
the
father
and
jilted
by
the
son
i
would
give
my
life
to
cancel
the
wrong
i
said
it
is
so
easy
to
talk
she
replied
with
a
deadly
coldness
of
tone
and
manner
i
am
ready
to
do
whatever
you
choose
i
urged
it
is
true
my
father
has
robbed
you
but
it
is
not
true
that
i
have
jilted
you
i
did
not
know
my
own
heart
till
a
word
from
captain
carey
revealed
it
to
me
and
i
told
you
frankly
partly
because
johanna
insisted
upon
it
and
partly
because
i
believed
it
right
to
do
so
if
you
demand
it
i
will
even
promise
not
to
see
olivia
again
or
to
hold
direct
communication
with
her
surely
that
is
all
you
ought
to
require
from
me
no
she
replied
vehemently
do
you
suppose
i
could
become
your
wife
while
you
maintain
that
you
love
another
woman
better
than
me
you
must
have
a
very
low
opinion
of
me
would
you
have
me
tell
you
a
falsehood
i
rejoined
with
vehemence
equal
to
hers
you
had
better
leave
me
she
said
before
we
hate
one
another
i
tell
you
i
have
been
robbed
by
the
father
and
jilted
by
the
son
martin
julia
i
replied
but
i
still
lingered
hoping
she
would
speak
to
me
again
i
was
anxious
to
hear
what
she
would
do
against
my
father
she
looked
at
me
fully
and
angrily
and
as
i
did
not
move
she
swept
out
of
the
room
with
a
dignity
which
i
had
never
seen
in
her
before
i
retreated
toward
the
but
could
not
make
good
my
escape
without
encountering
johanna
well
martin
she
said
it
is
all
wrong
i
answered
julia
persists
in
it
that
i
am
jilting
her
all
the
world
will
think
you
have
behaved
very
badly
she
said
i
suppose
so
i
replied
but
do
you
think
so
johanna
she
shook
her
head
in
silence
and
closed
the
after
me
many
a
door
in
guernsey
would
be
shut
against
me
as
soon
as
this
was
known
i
had
to
go
round
to
the
stables
to
find
madam
the
man
had
evidently
expected
me
to
stay
a
long
while
for
her
were
loosened
and
the
bit
out
of
her
mouth
that
she
might
enjoy
a
liberal
feed
of
oats
captain
carey
came
up
tome
as
i
was
buckling
the
girths
well
martin
he
asked
exactly
as
johanna
had
done
before
him
all
wrong
i
repeated
dear
dear
he
said
in
his
mildest
tones
and
with
his
hand
resting
affectionately
on
my
shoulder
i
wish
i
had
lost
the
use
of
my
eyes
or
tongue
the
other
day
i
am
vexed
to
death
that
i
found
out
your
secret
perhaps
i
should
not
have
found
it
out
myself
i
said
and
it
is
better
now
than
after
so
it
is
my
boy
so
it
is
he
rejoined
between
ourselves
julia
is
a
little
too
old
for
you
cheer
up
she
is
a
good
girl
and
will
get
over
it
and
be
friends
again
with
you
i
will
do
all
i
can
to
bring
that
about
if
olivia
is
only
as
good
as
she
is
handsome
be
happier
with
her
than
with
poor
julia
he
patted
my
back
with
a
friendliness
that
cheered
me
while
his
last
words
sent
the
blood
bounding
through
my
veins
i
rode
home
again
sark
lying
in
full
view
before
me
and
in
spite
of
the
darkness
of
my
prospects
i
felt
intensely
glad
to
be
free
to
win
my
olivia
four
days
passed
without
any
sign
from
either
julia
or
my
father
i
wrote
to
him
detailing
my
interview
with
her
but
no
reply
came
my
mother
and
i
had
the
house
to
ourselves
and
in
spite
of
her
frettings
we
enjoyed
considerable
pleasure
during
the
temporary
lull
there
were
however
sundry
warnings
which
foretold
tempest
i
met
cold
glances
and
sharp
inquiries
from
old
friends
among
whom
some
rumors
of
our
separation
were
floating
there
was
sufficient
to
justify
suspicion
my
father
absence
julia
prolonged
sojourn
with
the
careys
at
the
vale
and
the
postponement
of
my
voyage
to
england
i
began
to
fancy
that
even
the
flouted
at
me
chapter
the
dead
to
honor
the
mail
from
jersey
on
monday
morning
brought
us
no
letter
from
my
father
but
during
the
afternoon
as
i
was
passing
along
the
canichers
i
came
suddenly
upon
captain
carey
and
julia
who
wore
a
thick
veil
over
her
face
the
canichers
is
a
very
narrow
winding
street
where
no
conveyances
are
allowed
to
run
and
all
of
us
had
chosen
it
in
preference
to
the
broad
road
along
the
quay
where
we
were
liable
to
meet
many
acquaintances
there
was
no
escape
for
any
of
us
an
enormously
high
strong
wall
such
as
abound
in
was
on
one
side
of
us
and
some
stables
on
the
other
julia
turned
away
her
head
and
appeared
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
a
very
small
placard
which
did
not
cover
one
stone
of
the
wall
though
it
was
the
only
one
there
i
shook
hands
with
captain
carey
who
regarded
us
with
a
comical
expression
of
distress
and
waited
to
see
if
she
would
recognize
me
but
she
did
not
julia
has
had
a
letter
from
your
father
he
said
yes
i
replied
in
a
tone
of
inquiry
or
rather
from
collas
he
pursued
prepare
yourself
for
bad
news
martin
your
father
is
very
ill
dangerously
so
he
thinks
the
news
did
not
startle
me
i
had
been
long
aware
that
my
father
was
one
of
those
medical
men
who
are
excessively
nervous
about
their
own
health
and
are
astonished
that
so
delicate
and
complicated
an
organization
as
the
human
frame
should
ever
survive
for
sixty
years
the
ills
it
is
exposed
to
but
at
this
time
it
was
possible
that
distress
of
mind
and
anxiety
for
the
future
might
have
made
him
really
ill
there
was
no
chance
of
crossing
to
jersey
before
the
next
morning
he
wished
collas
to
write
to
julia
so
as
not
to
alarm
your
mother
continued
captain
carey
as
i
stood
silent
i
will
go
i
said
but
we
must
not
frighten
my
mother
if
we
can
help
it
dobrée
begs
that
you
will
go
he
answered
you
and
julia
julia
i
exclaimed
oh
impossible
i
do
see
that
it
is
impossible
said
julia
speaking
for
the
first
time
he
is
my
own
uncle
and
has
acted
as
my
father
i
intend
to
go
to
see
him
but
captain
carey
has
promised
to
go
with
me
thank
you
a
thousand
times
dear
julia
i
answered
gratefully
a
heavy
load
was
lifted
off
my
spirits
for
i
came
to
this
conclusion
that
she
had
said
nothing
and
would
say
nothing
to
the
careys
about
his
defalcations
she
would
not
make
her
uncle
shame
public
i
told
my
mother
that
julia
and
i
were
going
over
to
jersey
the
next
morning
and
she
was
more
than
satisfied
we
went
on
board
together
as
arranged
julia
captain
carey
and
i
but
julia
did
not
stay
on
deck
and
i
saw
nothing
of
her
during
our
sail
captain
carey
told
me
feelingly
how
terribly
she
was
fretting
notwithstanding
all
their
efforts
to
console
her
he
was
full
of
this
topic
and
could
think
and
speak
of
nothing
else
worrying
me
with
the
most
minute
particulars
of
her
deep
dejection
until
i
felt
myself
one
of
the
most
worthless
scoundrels
in
existence
i
was
in
this
humiliated
state
of
mind
when
we
landed
in
jersey
and
drove
in
separate
cars
to
the
hotel
where
my
father
was
lying
ill
the
landlady
received
us
with
a
portentous
face
collas
had
spoken
very
seriously
indeed
of
his
patient
and
as
for
herself
she
had
not
the
smallest
hope
i
heard
julia
sob
and
saw
her
lift
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
behind
her
veil
captain
carey
looked
very
much
frightened
he
was
a
man
of
quick
sympathies
and
nervous
about
his
own
life
into
the
bargain
so
that
any
serious
illness
alarmed
him
as
for
myself
i
was
in
the
miserable
condition
of
mind
i
have
described
above
we
were
not
admitted
into
my
father
room
for
half
an
hour
as
he
sent
word
he
must
get
up
his
strength
for
the
interview
julia
and
myself
alone
were
allowed
to
see
him
he
was
propped
up
in
bed
with
a
number
of
pillows
with
the
room
darkened
by
venetian
blinds
and
a
dim
green
twilight
prevailing
which
cast
a
sickly
hue
over
his
really
pallid
face
his
abundant
white
hair
fell
lankly
about
his
head
instead
of
being
in
crisp
curls
as
usual
i
was
about
to
feel
his
pulse
for
him
but
he
waved
me
off
no
my
son
he
said
my
recovery
is
not
to
be
desired
i
feel
that
i
have
nothing
now
to
do
but
to
die
it
is
the
only
reparation
in
my
power
i
would
far
rather
die
than
recover
i
had
nothing
to
say
to
that
indeed
i
had
really
no
answer
ready
so
amazed
was
i
at
the
tone
he
had
taken
but
julia
began
to
sob
again
and
pressed
past
me
sinking
down
on
the
chair
by
his
side
and
laying
her
hand
upon
one
of
his
pillows
julia
my
love
he
continued
feebly
you
know
how
i
have
wronged
you
but
you
are
a
true
christian
you
will
forgive
your
uncle
when
he
is
dead
and
gone
i
should
like
to
be
buried
in
guernsey
with
the
other
dobrées
neither
did
julia
answer
save
by
sobs
i
stepped
toward
the
window
to
draw
up
the
blinds
but
he
stopped
me
speaking
in
a
much
stronger
voice
than
before
leave
them
alone
he
said
i
have
no
wish
to
see
the
light
of
day
a
dishonored
man
does
not
care
to
show
his
face
i
have
seen
no
one
since
i
left
guernsey
except
collas
i
think
you
are
alarming
yourself
needlessly
i
answered
you
know
you
are
fidgety
about
your
own
health
let
me
prescribe
for
you
surely
i
know
as
much
as
collas
no
no
let
me
die
he
said
plaintively
then
you
can
all
be
happy
i
have
robbed
my
only
brother
only
child
who
was
dear
to
me
as
my
own
daughter
i
can
not
hold
up
my
head
after
that
i
should
die
gladly
if
you
two
were
but
reconciled
to
one
another
by
this
time
julia
hand
had
reached
his
and
was
resting
in
it
fondly
i
never
knew
a
man
gifted
with
such
power
over
women
and
their
susceptibilities
as
he
had
my
mother
herself
would
appear
to
forget
all
her
unhappiness
if
he
only
smiled
upon
her
my
poor
dear
julia
he
murmured
my
poor
child
uncle
she
said
checking
her
sobs
by
a
great
effort
if
you
imagine
i
should
tell
any
one
johanna
carey
even
what
you
have
done
you
wrong
me
the
name
of
dobrée
is
as
dear
to
me
as
to
martin
and
he
was
willing
to
marry
a
woman
he
detested
in
order
to
shield
it
no
you
are
quite
safe
from
disgrace
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
god
in
heaven
bless
you
my
own
julia
he
ejaculated
fervently
i
knew
your
noble
nature
but
it
grieves
me
the
more
deeply
that
i
have
so
thoughtlessly
wronged
you
if
i
should
live
to
get
over
this
illness
i
will
explain
it
all
to
you
it
is
not
so
bad
as
it
seems
but
will
you
not
be
equally
generous
to
martin
can
not
you
forgive
him
as
you
do
me
uncle
she
cried
i
could
never
never
marry
a
man
who
says
he
loves
some
one
else
more
than
me
her
face
was
hidden
in
the
pillows
and
my
father
stroked
her
head
glancing
at
me
contemptuously
at
the
same
time
i
should
think
not
my
girl
he
said
in
a
soothing
tone
but
martin
will
very
soon
repent
he
is
a
fool
just
now
but
he
will
be
wise
again
presently
he
has
known
you
too
long
not
to
know
your
worth
julia
i
said
i
do
know
how
good
you
are
you
have
always
been
generous
and
you
are
so
now
i
owe
you
as
much
gratitude
as
my
father
does
and
any
thing
i
can
do
to
prove
it
i
am
ready
to
do
this
day
will
you
marry
her
before
we
leave
jersey
asked
my
father
yes
i
answered
the
word
slipped
from
me
almost
unawares
yet
i
did
not
wish
to
retract
it
she
was
behaving
so
nobly
and
generously
toward
us
both
that
i
was
willing
to
do
any
thing
to
make
her
happy
then
my
love
he
said
you
hear
what
martin
promises
all
well
that
ends
well
only
make
up
your
mind
to
put
your
proper
pride
away
and
we
shall
all
be
as
happy
as
we
were
before
never
she
cried
indignantly
i
would
not
marry
martin
here
hurriedly
and
furtively
no
not
if
you
were
dying
uncle
but
julia
if
i
were
dying
and
wished
to
see
you
united
before
my
death
he
insinuated
a
sudden
light
broke
upon
me
it
was
an
ingenious
plot
one
at
which
i
could
not
help
laughing
mad
as
i
was
pride
was
to
be
saved
and
an
immediate
marriage
between
us
effected
under
cover
of
my
father
dangerous
illness
i
did
smile
in
spite
of
my
anger
and
he
caught
it
and
smiled
back
again
i
think
julia
became
suspicious
too
martin
she
said
sharpening
her
voice
to
address
me
do
think
your
father
is
in
any
danger
no
i
do
not
i
answered
notwithstanding
his
gestures
and
frowns
then
that
is
at
an
end
she
said
i
was
almost
foolish
enough
to
think
that
i
would
yield
you
do
know
what
this
disappointment
is
to
me
everybody
will
be
talking
of
it
and
some
of
them
will
pity
me
and
the
rest
laugh
at
me
i
am
ashamed
of
going
anywhere
oh
it
is
too
bad
i
can
not
bear
it
she
was
positively
writhing
with
agitation
and
tears
real
tears
i
am
sure
started
into
my
father
eyes
my
poor
little
julia
he
said
my
darling
but
what
can
be
done
if
you
will
not
marry
martin
he
ought
to
go
away
from
guernsey
she
sobbed
i
should
feel
better
if
i
was
quite
sure
i
should
never
see
him
or
hear
of
other
people
seeing
him
i
will
go
i
said
guernsey
will
be
too
hot
for
me
when
all
this
is
known
and
uncle
she
pursued
speaking
to
him
not
me
he
ought
to
promise
me
to
give
up
that
girl
i
can
not
set
him
free
to
go
and
marry
her
a
stranger
and
adventuress
she
will
be
his
ruin
i
think
for
my
sake
he
ought
to
give
her
up
so
he
ought
and
so
he
will
my
love
answered
my
father
when
he
thinks
of
all
we
owe
to
you
he
will
promise
you
that
i
pondered
over
what
our
family
owed
to
julia
for
some
minutes
it
was
truly
a
very
great
debt
though
i
had
brought
her
into
perhaps
the
most
painful
position
a
woman
could
be
placed
in
she
was
generously
sacrificing
her
just
resentment
and
revenge
against
my
dishonesty
in
order
to
secure
our
name
from
blot
on
the
other
hand
i
had
no
reason
to
suppose
olivia
loved
me
and
i
should
do
her
no
wrong
i
felt
that
whatever
it
might
cost
me
i
must
consent
to
julia
stipulation
it
is
the
hardest
thing
you
could
ask
me
i
said
but
i
will
give
her
up
on
one
condition
however
for
i
must
not
leave
her
without
friends
i
shall
tell
tardif
if
he
ever
needs
help
for
olivia
he
must
apply
to
me
through
my
mother
there
could
be
no
harm
in
that
observed
my
father
how
soon
shall
i
leave
guernsey
i
asked
he
can
not
go
until
you
are
well
again
uncle
she
answered
i
will
stay
here
to
nurse
you
and
martin
must
take
care
of
your
patients
we
will
send
him
word
a
day
or
two
before
we
return
and
i
should
like
him
to
be
gone
before
we
reach
home
that
was
my
sentence
of
banishment
she
had
only
addressed
me
once
during
the
conversation
it
was
curious
to
see
how
there
was
no
resentment
in
her
manner
toward
my
father
who
had
systematically
robbed
her
while
she
treated
me
with
profound
wrath
and
bitterness
she
allowed
him
to
hold
her
hand
and
stroke
her
hair
she
would
not
have
suffered
me
to
approach
her
no
doubt
it
was
harder
for
her
to
give
up
a
lover
than
to
lose
the
whole
of
her
property
she
left
us
to
make
the
necessary
arrangements
for
staying
with
my
father
whose
illness
appeared
to
have
lost
suddenly
its
worst
symptoms
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
he
regarded
me
with
a
look
half
angry
half
contemptuous
what
a
fool
you
are
he
said
you
have
no
tact
whatever
in
the
management
of
women
julia
would
fly
back
to
you
if
you
only
held
up
your
finger
i
have
no
wish
to
hold
up
my
finger
to
her
i
answered
i
do
think
life
with
her
would
be
so
highly
desirable
you
thought
so
a
few
weeks
ago
he
said
and
you
be
a
pauper
without
her
i
was
not
going
to
marry
her
for
her
money
i
replied
a
few
weeks
ago
i
cared
more
for
her
than
for
any
other
woman
except
my
mother
and
she
knew
it
all
that
is
changed
now
well
well
he
said
peevishly
do
as
you
like
i
wash
my
hands
of
the
whole
business
julia
will
not
forsake
me
if
she
renounces
you
and
i
shall
have
need
of
her
and
her
money
i
shall
cling
to
julia
she
will
be
a
kind
nurse
to
you
i
remarked
excellent
he
answered
settling
himself
languidly
down
among
his
pillows
she
may
come
in
now
and
watch
beside
me
it
will
be
the
sort
of
occupation
to
suit
her
in
her
present
state
of
feeling
you
had
better
go
out
and
amuse
yourself
in
your
own
way
of
course
you
will
go
home
morning
i
would
have
gone
back
to
guernsey
at
once
but
i
found
neither
cutter
nor
yacht
sailing
that
afternoon
so
i
was
obliged
to
wait
for
the
steamer
next
morning
i
did
not
see
julia
again
but
captain
carey
told
me
she
had
consented
that
he
should
remain
at
hand
for
a
day
or
two
to
see
if
he
could
be
of
any
use
to
her
the
report
of
my
father
illness
had
spread
before
i
reached
home
and
sufficiently
accounted
for
our
visit
to
jersey
and
the
temporary
postponement
of
my
last
trip
to
england
before
our
marriage
my
mother
johanna
and
i
kept
our
own
counsel
and
answered
the
many
questions
asked
us
as
vaguely
as
the
delphic
oracle
still
an
uneasy
suspicion
and
suspense
hung
about
our
circle
the
atmosphere
was
heavily
charged
with
electricity
which
foreboded
storms
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
quit
guernsey
before
all
the
truth
came
out
i
wrote
to
tardif
telling
him
i
was
going
for
an
indefinite
period
to
london
and
that
if
any
difficulty
or
danger
threatened
olivia
i
begged
of
him
to
communicate
with
my
mother
who
had
promised
me
to
befriend
her
as
far
as
it
lay
in
her
power
my
poor
mother
thought
of
her
without
bitterness
though
with
deep
regret
to
olivia
herself
i
wrote
a
line
or
two
finding
myself
too
weak
to
resist
the
temptation
i
said
my
dear
olivia
i
told
you
i
was
about
to
be
married
to
my
cousin
julia
dobrée
that
engagement
is
at
an
end
i
am
obliged
to
leave
guernsey
and
seek
my
fortune
elsewhere
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
i
can
see
you
again
if
i
ever
have
that
great
happiness
whenever
you
feel
the
want
of
a
true
and
tender
friend
my
mother
is
prepared
to
love
you
as
if
you
were
her
own
daughter
think
of
me
also
as
your
friend
martin
dobrée
chapter
the
in
exile
i
left
guernsey
the
day
before
my
father
and
julia
returned
from
jersey
my
immediate
future
was
not
as
black
as
it
might
have
been
i
was
going
direct
to
the
house
of
my
friend
jack
senior
who
had
been
my
chum
both
at
elizabeth
college
and
at
guy
he
like
myself
had
been
hitherto
a
sort
of
partner
to
his
father
the
physician
senior
of
brook
street
they
lived
together
in
a
but
gloomy
residence
kept
bachelor
fashion
for
they
had
no
at
all
belonging
to
them
the
father
and
son
lived
a
good
deal
apart
though
they
were
deeply
attached
to
one
another
jack
had
his
own
apartments
and
his
own
guests
in
the
spacious
house
and
senior
had
his
the
first
night
as
jack
and
i
sat
up
together
in
the
long
summer
twilight
till
the
dim
not
really
dark
midnight
came
over
us
i
told
him
every
thing
as
one
tells
a
friend
a
hundred
things
one
can
not
put
into
words
to
any
person
who
dwells
under
the
same
roof
and
is
witness
of
every
circumstance
of
one
career
as
i
was
talking
to
him
every
emotion
and
perception
of
my
brain
which
had
been
in
a
wild
state
of
confusion
and
conflict
appeared
to
fall
into
its
proper
rank
i
was
no
longer
doubtful
as
to
whether
i
had
been
the
fool
my
father
called
me
my
love
for
olivia
acquired
force
and
decision
my
judgment
that
it
would
have
been
a
folly
and
a
crime
to
marry
julia
became
confirmed
old
fellow
said
jack
when
i
had
finished
you
are
in
no
end
of
a
mess
well
i
am
i
admitted
but
what
am
i
to
do
first
of
all
how
much
money
have
you
he
asked
i
rather
not
say
i
answered
come
old
friend
he
said
in
his
most
persuasive
tones
have
you
fifty
pounds
in
hand
no
i
replied
thirty
i
shook
my
head
but
i
would
not
answer
him
further
that
bad
he
said
but
it
might
be
worse
i
lots
of
tin
and
we
always
went
shares
i
must
look
out
for
something
to
do
i
remarked
ay
yes
he
answered
dryly
you
might
go
as
assistant
to
a
parish
doctor
or
get
a
berth
on
board
an
there
are
lots
of
chances
for
a
young
fellow
he
sat
smoking
his
cigar
a
dusky
outline
of
a
human
figure
with
a
bright
speck
of
red
about
the
centre
of
the
face
for
a
few
minutes
he
was
lost
in
thought
i
tell
you
what
he
said
i
a
good
mind
to
marry
julia
myself
i
always
liked
her
and
we
want
a
woman
in
the
house
that
would
put
things
straighter
would
it
she
would
never
consent
to
leave
guernsey
i
answered
laughing
that
was
one
reason
why
she
was
so
glad
to
marry
me
well
then
he
said
would
you
mind
me
having
olivia
do
jest
about
such
a
thing
i
replied
it
is
too
serious
a
question
with
me
you
are
really
in
love
he
answered
i
will
not
jest
at
it
but
i
am
ready
to
do
any
thing
to
help
you
old
boy
so
it
proved
for
he
and
senior
did
their
best
during
the
next
few
weeks
to
find
a
suitable
opening
for
me
i
made
their
house
my
home
and
was
treated
as
a
most
welcome
guest
in
it
still
the
time
was
irksome
more
irksome
than
i
ever
could
have
imagined
they
were
busy
while
i
was
unoccupied
occasionally
i
went
out
to
obey
some
urgent
summons
when
either
of
them
was
absent
but
that
was
a
rare
circumstance
the
hours
hung
heavily
upon
me
and
the
close
sultry
air
of
london
so
different
from
the
fresh
of
my
native
place
made
me
feel
languid
and
irritable
my
mother
letters
did
not
tend
to
raise
my
spirits
the
tone
of
them
was
uniformly
sad
she
told
me
the
flood
of
sympathy
for
julia
had
risen
very
high
indeed
from
which
i
concluded
that
the
public
indignation
against
myself
must
have
risen
to
the
same
though
my
poor
mother
said
nothing
about
it
julia
had
resumed
her
old
occupations
but
her
spirit
was
quite
broken
johanna
carey
had
offered
to
go
abroad
with
her
but
she
had
declined
it
because
it
would
too
painfully
remind
her
of
our
projected
trip
to
switzerland
a
friend
of
julia
said
my
mother
in
another
letter
had
come
to
stay
with
her
and
to
try
to
rouse
her
it
was
evident
she
did
not
like
this
kate
daltrey
herself
for
the
dislike
crept
out
unawares
through
all
the
gentleness
of
her
phrases
she
says
she
is
the
same
age
as
julia
she
wrote
but
she
is
probably
some
years
older
for
as
she
does
not
belong
to
guernsey
we
have
no
opportunity
of
knowing
i
laughed
when
i
read
that
your
father
admires
her
very
much
she
added
no
my
mother
felt
no
affection
for
her
new
guest
there
was
not
a
word
about
olivia
sark
itself
was
never
mentioned
and
it
might
have
sunk
into
the
sea
my
eye
ran
over
every
letter
first
with
the
hope
of
catching
that
name
but
i
could
not
find
it
this
persistent
silence
on
my
mother
part
was
very
trying
i
had
been
away
from
guernsey
two
months
and
jack
was
making
arrangements
for
a
long
absence
from
london
as
soon
as
the
season
was
over
leaving
me
in
charge
when
i
received
the
following
letter
from
johanna
carey
dear
martin
your
father
and
julia
have
been
here
this
afternoon
and
have
confided
to
me
a
very
sad
and
very
painful
secret
which
they
ask
me
to
break
gently
to
you
i
am
afraid
no
shadow
of
a
suspicion
of
it
has
ever
fallen
upon
your
mind
and
i
warn
you
you
will
need
all
your
courage
and
strength
as
a
man
to
bear
it
i
was
myself
so
overwhelmed
that
i
could
not
write
to
you
until
now
in
the
dead
of
the
night
having
prayed
with
all
my
heart
to
our
merciful
god
to
sustain
and
comfort
you
who
will
feel
this
sorrow
more
than
any
of
us
my
dearest
martin
my
poor
boy
how
can
i
tell
it
to
you
you
must
come
home
again
for
a
season
even
julia
wishes
it
though
she
can
not
stay
in
the
same
house
with
you
and
will
go
to
her
own
with
her
friend
kate
daltrey
your
father
cried
like
a
child
he
takes
it
more
to
heart
than
i
should
have
expected
yet
there
is
no
immediate
danger
she
may
live
for
some
months
yet
my
poor
martin
you
will
have
a
mother
only
a
few
months
longer
three
weeks
ago
she
and
i
went
to
sark
at
her
own
urgent
wish
to
see
your
olivia
i
did
not
then
know
why
she
had
a
great
longing
to
see
the
unfortunate
girl
who
had
been
the
cause
of
so
much
sorrow
to
us
all
but
especially
to
her
for
she
has
pined
sorely
after
you
we
did
not
find
her
in
tardif
house
but
suzanne
directed
us
to
the
little
graveyard
half
a
mile
away
we
followed
her
there
and
recognized
her
of
course
at
the
first
glance
she
is
a
charming
creature
that
i
allow
though
i
wish
none
of
us
had
ever
seen
her
your
mother
told
her
who
she
was
and
the
sweetest
flush
and
smile
came
across
her
face
they
sat
down
side
by
side
on
one
of
the
graves
and
i
strolled
away
so
i
do
not
know
what
they
said
to
one
another
olivia
walked
down
with
us
to
the
havre
gosselin
and
your
mother
held
her
in
her
arms
and
kissed
her
tenderly
even
i
could
not
help
kissing
her
now
i
understand
why
your
mother
longed
to
see
olivia
she
knew
then
she
has
known
for
months
that
her
days
are
numbered
when
she
was
in
london
last
november
she
saw
the
most
skilful
physicians
and
they
all
agreed
that
her
disease
was
incurable
and
fatal
why
did
she
conceal
it
from
you
ah
martin
you
must
know
a
woman
heart
a
mother
heart
before
you
can
comprehend
that
your
father
knew
but
no
one
else
what
a
martyrdom
of
silent
agony
she
has
passed
through
she
has
a
clear
calculation
based
upon
the
opinion
of
the
medical
men
as
to
how
long
she
might
have
lived
had
her
mind
been
kept
calm
and
happy
how
far
that
has
not
been
the
case
we
all
know
too
well
if
your
marriage
with
julia
had
taken
place
you
would
now
have
been
on
your
way
home
not
to
be
parted
from
her
again
till
the
final
separation
we
all
ask
you
to
return
to
guernsey
and
devote
a
few
more
weeks
to
one
who
has
loved
you
so
passionately
and
fondly
even
julia
asks
it
her
resentment
gives
way
before
this
terrible
sorrow
we
have
not
told
your
mother
what
we
are
about
to
do
lest
any
thing
should
prevent
your
return
she
is
as
patient
and
gentle
as
a
lamb
and
is
ready
with
a
quiet
smile
for
every
one
o
martin
what
a
loss
she
will
be
to
us
all
my
heart
is
bleeding
for
you
do
not
come
before
you
have
answered
this
letter
that
we
may
prepare
her
for
your
return
write
by
the
next
boat
and
come
by
the
one
after
julia
will
have
to
move
down
to
the
new
house
and
that
will
be
excitement
enough
for
one
day
my
dearest
martin
i
have
forgiven
every
thing
so
will
all
our
friends
as
soon
as
they
know
this
dreadful
secret
your
faithful
loving
cousin
johanna
carey
i
read
this
letter
twice
with
a
singing
in
my
ears
and
a
whirling
of
my
brain
before
i
could
realize
the
meaning
then
i
refused
to
believe
it
no
one
knows
better
than
a
doctor
how
the
most
skilful
head
among
us
may
be
at
fault
my
mother
dying
of
an
incurable
disease
impossible
i
would
go
over
at
once
and
save
her
she
ought
to
have
told
me
first
who
could
have
attended
her
so
skilfully
and
devotedly
as
her
only
son
yet
the
numbing
deadly
chill
of
dread
rested
upon
my
heart
i
felt
keenly
how
slight
my
power
was
as
i
had
done
once
before
when
i
thought
olivia
would
die
but
then
i
had
no
resources
no
appliances
now
i
would
take
home
with
me
every
remedy
the
experience
and
researches
of
man
had
discovered
chapter
the
overmatched
my
mother
had
consulted
senior
himself
when
she
had
been
in
london
he
did
not
positively
cut
off
all
hope
from
me
though
i
knew
well
he
was
giving
me
encouragement
in
spite
of
his
own
opinion
he
asserted
emphatically
that
it
was
possible
to
alleviate
her
sufferings
and
prolong
her
life
especially
if
her
mind
was
kept
at
rest
there
was
not
a
question
as
to
the
necessity
for
my
immediate
return
to
her
but
there
was
still
a
day
for
me
to
tarry
in
london
martin
said
jack
why
have
you
never
followed
up
the
clew
about
your
olivia
the
advertisement
you
know
shall
we
go
to
those
folks
in
road
this
afternoon
it
had
been
in
my
mind
all
along
to
do
so
but
the
listless
procrastination
of
idleness
had
caused
me
to
put
it
off
from
time
to
time
besides
while
i
was
absent
from
the
channel
islands
my
curiosity
appeared
to
sleep
it
was
enough
to
picture
olivia
in
her
lowly
home
in
sark
now
that
i
was
returning
to
guernsey
and
the
opportunity
was
about
to
slip
by
i
felt
more
anxious
to
seize
it
i
would
learn
all
i
could
about
olivia
family
and
friends
without
betraying
any
part
of
her
secret
at
the
nearest
we
found
a
cabman
patronized
by
jack
a
and
man
who
was
as
fond
and
proud
of
jack
notice
as
if
he
had
been
one
of
the
royal
princes
of
course
there
was
not
the
smallest
difficulty
in
finding
the
office
of
scott
and
brown
it
was
on
the
second
floor
of
an
ordinary
building
and
bidding
the
cabman
wait
for
us
we
proceeded
at
once
up
the
staircase
there
did
not
seem
much
business
going
on
and
our
appearance
was
hailed
with
undisguised
satisfaction
the
solicitors
if
they
were
solicitors
were
two
inferior
men
but
sharp
enough
to
be
a
match
for
either
of
us
we
both
felt
it
as
if
we
had
detected
a
snake
in
the
grass
by
its
rattle
i
grew
wary
by
instinct
though
i
had
not
come
with
any
intention
to
tell
them
what
i
knew
of
olivia
my
sole
idea
had
been
to
learn
something
myself
not
to
impart
any
information
but
when
i
was
face
to
face
with
these
men
my
business
and
the
management
of
it
did
not
seem
quite
so
simple
as
it
had
done
until
then
do
you
wish
to
consult
my
partner
or
me
asked
the
man
i
am
mr
scott
either
will
do
i
answered
my
business
will
be
soon
dispatched
some
months
ago
you
inserted
an
advertisement
in
the
to
what
purport
inquired
scott
you
offered
fifty
pounds
reward
i
replied
for
information
concerning
a
young
lady
a
gleam
of
intelligence
and
gratification
flickered
upon
both
their
faces
but
quickly
faded
away
into
a
sober
and
blank
gravity
scott
waited
for
me
to
speak
again
and
bowed
silently
as
if
to
intimate
he
was
all
attention
i
came
i
added
to
ask
you
for
the
name
and
address
of
that
young
lady
friends
as
i
should
prefer
communicating
directly
with
them
with
a
view
to
cooperation
in
the
discovery
of
her
i
need
scarcely
say
i
have
no
wish
to
receive
any
reward
i
entirely
waive
any
claim
to
that
if
you
will
oblige
me
by
putting
me
into
connection
with
the
family
have
you
no
information
you
can
impart
to
us
asked
scott
none
i
answered
decisively
it
is
some
months
since
i
saw
the
advertisement
and
it
must
be
nine
months
since
you
put
it
into
the
i
believe
it
is
nine
months
since
the
young
lady
was
missing
about
that
time
he
said
her
friends
must
have
suffered
great
anxiety
i
remarked
very
great
indeed
he
admitted
if
i
could
render
them
any
service
it
would
be
a
great
pleasure
to
me
i
continued
can
not
you
tell
me
where
to
find
them
we
are
authorized
to
receive
any
information
he
replied
you
must
allow
me
to
ask
if
you
know
any
thing
about
the
young
lady
in
question
my
object
is
to
combine
with
her
friends
in
seeking
her
i
said
evasively
i
really
can
not
give
you
any
information
but
if
you
will
put
me
into
communication
with
them
i
may
be
useful
to
them
well
he
said
with
an
air
of
candor
of
course
the
young
friends
are
anxious
to
keep
in
the
background
it
is
not
a
pleasant
circumstance
to
occur
in
a
family
and
if
possible
they
would
wish
her
to
be
restored
without
any
of
course
if
you
could
give
us
any
definite
information
it
would
be
quite
another
thing
the
young
family
is
highly
connected
have
you
seen
any
one
answering
to
the
description
it
is
a
very
common
one
i
answered
i
have
seen
scores
of
young
ladies
who
might
answer
to
it
i
am
surprised
that
in
london
you
could
not
trace
her
did
you
apply
to
the
police
the
police
are
blockheads
replied
mr
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
see
if
there
is
any
one
in
the
outer
office
brown
or
on
the
stairs
i
believe
i
heard
a
noise
outside
brown
disappeared
for
a
few
minutes
but
his
absence
did
not
interrupt
our
conversation
there
was
not
much
to
be
made
out
of
it
on
either
side
for
we
were
only
fencing
with
one
another
i
learned
nothing
about
olivia
friends
and
i
was
satisfied
he
had
learned
nothing
about
her
at
last
we
parted
with
mutual
dissatisfaction
and
i
went
moodily
downstairs
followed
by
jack
we
drove
back
to
brook
street
to
spend
the
few
hours
that
remained
before
the
train
started
for
southampton
doctor
said
simmons
as
jack
paid
him
his
fare
with
a
small
coin
added
to
it
i
half
afeard
i
done
some
mischief
i
been
turning
it
over
and
over
in
my
head
and
ca
exactly
see
the
rights
of
it
a
gent
with
a
pen
behind
his
ear
comes
down
at
that
orfice
in
inn
road
and
takes
my
number
but
after
that
he
says
a
civil
thing
or
two
young
gents
he
says
pointing
up
the
staircase
much
so
says
i
doctors
he
says
right
i
says
guessed
so
he
says
pretty
well
up
the
tree
eh
i
says
gent
is
son
to
senior
the
great
pheeseecian
and
the
other
he
comes
from
guernsey
which
is
an
island
in
the
sea
so
he
says
heard
as
much
i
hope
i
done
no
mischief
doctor
i
hope
not
simmons
answered
jack
but
your
tongue
hangs
too
loose
my
look
out
for
a
squall
on
the
olivia
coast
martin
he
added
my
anxiety
would
have
been
very
great
if
i
had
not
been
returning
immediately
to
guernsey
but
once
there
and
in
communication
with
tardif
i
could
not
believe
any
danger
would
threaten
olivia
from
which
i
could
not
protect
or
rescue
her
she
was
of
age
and
had
a
right
to
act
for
herself
with
two
such
friends
as
tardif
and
me
no
one
could
force
her
away
from
her
chosen
home
chapter
the
home
again
my
mother
was
looking
out
for
me
when
i
reached
home
the
next
morning
i
had
taken
a
car
from
the
to
avoid
meeting
any
acquaintances
and
hers
was
almost
the
first
familiar
face
i
saw
it
was
pallid
with
the
sickly
hue
of
a
confirmed
disease
and
her
eyes
were
much
sunken
but
she
ran
across
the
room
to
meet
me
i
was
afraid
to
touch
her
knowing
how
a
careless
movement
might
cause
her
excruciating
pain
but
she
was
oblivious
of
every
thing
save
my
return
and
pressed
me
closer
and
closer
in
her
arms
with
all
her
failing
strength
while
i
leaned
my
face
down
upon
her
dear
head
unable
to
utter
a
word
god
is
very
good
to
me
sobbed
my
mother
is
he
i
said
my
voice
sounding
strange
to
my
own
ears
so
forced
and
altered
it
was
very
very
good
she
repeated
he
has
brought
you
back
to
me
never
to
leave
you
again
mother
i
said
never
again
no
you
will
never
leave
me
alone
again
here
she
whispered
oh
how
i
have
missed
you
my
boy
i
made
her
sit
down
on
the
sofa
and
sat
beside
her
while
she
caressed
my
hand
with
her
thin
and
wasted
fingers
i
must
put
an
end
to
this
if
i
was
to
maintain
my
mother
i
said
you
forget
that
i
have
been
on
the
sea
all
night
and
have
not
had
my
breakfast
yet
the
old
cry
martin
she
answered
smiling
well
you
shall
have
your
breakfast
here
and
i
will
wait
upon
you
once
more
i
watched
her
furtively
as
she
moved
about
not
with
her
usual
quick
and
light
movements
but
with
a
slow
and
cautious
tread
it
was
part
of
my
anguish
to
know
as
only
a
medical
man
can
know
how
every
step
was
a
fresh
pang
to
her
she
sat
down
with
me
at
the
table
though
i
would
not
suffer
her
to
pour
out
my
coffee
as
she
wished
to
do
there
was
a
divine
smile
upon
her
face
yet
beneath
it
there
was
an
indication
of
constant
and
terrible
pain
in
the
sunken
eyes
and
drawn
lips
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
eat
with
that
smiling
face
opposite
me
i
drank
thirstily
but
i
could
not
swallow
a
crumb
she
knew
what
it
meant
and
her
eyes
were
fastened
upon
me
with
a
expression
that
mockery
of
a
meal
over
she
permitted
me
to
lay
her
down
on
the
sofa
almost
as
submissively
as
a
tired
child
and
to
cover
her
with
an
quilt
for
her
malady
made
her
shiver
with
its
deadly
coldness
while
she
could
not
bear
any
weight
upon
her
my
father
was
gone
out
and
would
not
be
back
before
evening
the
whole
day
lay
before
us
i
should
have
my
mother
entirely
to
myself
we
had
very
much
to
say
to
one
another
but
it
could
only
be
said
at
intervals
when
her
strength
allowed
of
it
we
talked
together
more
calmly
than
i
could
have
believed
possible
of
her
approaching
death
and
in
a
stupor
of
despair
i
owned
to
myself
and
her
that
there
was
not
a
hope
of
her
being
spared
to
me
much
longer
i
have
longed
so
she
murmured
to
see
my
boy
in
a
home
of
his
own
before
i
died
perhaps
i
was
wrong
but
that
was
why
i
urged
on
your
marriage
with
julia
you
will
have
no
real
home
after
i
am
gone
martin
and
i
feel
as
if
i
could
die
so
much
more
quietly
if
i
had
some
knowledge
of
your
future
life
now
i
shall
know
nothing
i
think
that
is
the
sting
of
death
to
me
i
wish
it
had
been
as
you
wanted
it
to
be
i
said
never
feeling
so
bitterly
the
disappointment
i
had
caused
her
and
almost
grieved
that
i
had
ever
seen
olivia
i
suppose
it
is
all
for
the
best
she
answered
feebly
o
martin
i
have
seen
your
olivia
well
i
said
i
did
so
want
to
see
her
she
continued
though
she
has
brought
us
all
into
such
trouble
i
loved
her
because
you
love
her
johanna
went
with
me
because
she
is
such
a
good
judge
you
know
and
i
did
not
like
to
rely
upon
my
own
feelings
appearances
are
very
much
against
her
but
she
is
very
engaging
and
i
believe
she
is
a
good
girl
i
am
sure
she
is
good
i
know
she
is
i
said
we
talked
of
you
she
went
on
how
good
you
were
to
her
that
week
in
the
spring
she
had
never
been
quite
unconscious
she
thought
but
she
had
seen
and
heard
you
all
the
time
and
knew
you
were
doing
your
utmost
to
save
her
i
believe
we
talked
more
of
you
than
of
any
thing
else
that
was
very
likely
i
knew
as
far
as
my
mother
was
concerned
but
i
was
anxious
to
hear
whether
olivia
had
not
confided
to
her
more
of
her
secret
than
i
had
yet
been
able
to
learn
from
other
sources
to
a
woman
like
my
mother
she
might
have
intrusted
all
her
history
did
you
find
any
thing
out
about
her
friends
and
family
i
asked
not
much
she
answered
she
told
me
her
own
mother
had
died
when
she
was
quite
a
child
and
she
had
a
living
who
has
been
the
ruin
of
her
life
that
was
her
expression
has
been
the
ruin
of
my
life
she
said
and
she
cried
a
little
martin
with
her
head
upon
my
lap
if
i
could
only
have
offered
her
a
home
here
and
promised
to
be
a
mother
to
her
god
bless
you
my
darling
mother
i
said
she
intends
to
stay
where
she
is
as
long
as
it
is
possible
she
continued
but
she
told
me
she
wanted
work
to
do
any
kind
of
work
by
which
she
could
earn
a
little
money
she
has
a
diamond
ring
and
a
watch
and
chain
worth
a
hundred
pounds
so
she
must
have
been
used
to
affluence
yet
she
spoke
as
if
she
might
have
to
live
in
sark
for
years
it
is
a
very
strange
position
for
a
young
girl
mother
i
said
you
do
not
know
how
all
this
weighs
upon
me
i
promised
julia
to
give
her
up
and
never
to
see
her
again
but
it
is
almost
more
than
i
can
bear
especially
now
i
shall
be
as
friendless
and
homeless
as
olivia
i
had
knelt
down
beside
her
and
she
pressed
my
face
to
hers
murmuring
those
soft
fondling
words
which
a
man
only
hears
from
his
lips
i
knew
that
the
anguish
of
her
soul
was
even
greater
than
my
own
the
agitation
was
growing
too
much
for
her
and
would
end
in
an
access
of
her
disease
i
must
put
an
end
to
it
at
once
i
suppose
julia
is
gone
to
the
new
house
now
i
said
in
a
calm
voice
yes
she
answered
but
she
could
say
no
more
and
miss
daltrey
with
her
i
pursued
the
mention
of
that
name
certainly
roused
my
mother
more
effectually
than
any
thing
else
i
could
have
said
she
released
me
from
her
clinging
hands
and
looked
up
with
a
decided
expression
of
dislike
on
her
face
yes
she
replied
julia
is
just
wrapped
up
in
her
though
why
i
can
not
imagine
so
is
your
father
but
i
do
think
you
will
like
her
martin
i
do
want
you
to
be
taken
with
her
i
wo
mother
i
said
i
am
ready
to
hate
her
if
that
is
any
satisfaction
to
you
oh
you
must
not
say
that
she
answered
in
a
tone
of
alarm
i
do
not
wish
to
set
you
against
her
not
in
the
least
my
boy
only
she
has
so
much
influence
over
julia
and
your
father
and
i
do
not
want
you
to
go
over
to
her
side
i
know
i
am
very
silly
but
she
always
makes
my
flesh
creep
when
she
is
in
the
room
then
she
shall
not
come
into
the
room
i
said
martin
she
went
on
why
does
it
rouse
one
up
more
to
speak
evil
of
people
than
to
speak
good
of
them
speaking
of
kate
daltrey
makes
me
feel
stronger
than
talking
of
olivia
i
laughed
a
little
it
had
been
an
observation
of
mine
made
some
years
ago
that
the
surest
method
of
consolation
in
cases
of
excessive
grief
was
the
introduction
of
some
family
or
neighborly
gossip
seasoned
slightly
with
scandal
the
most
vehement
mourning
had
been
turned
into
another
current
of
thought
by
the
lifting
of
this
sluice
it
restores
the
balance
of
the
emotions
i
answered
anything
soft
and
tender
and
touching
makes
you
more
sensitive
a
person
like
miss
daltrey
acts
as
a
tonic
bitter
perhaps
but
invigorating
the
morning
passed
without
any
interruption
but
in
the
afternoon
grace
came
in
with
a
face
full
of
grave
importance
to
announce
that
miss
dobrée
had
called
and
desired
to
see
dobrée
alone
quite
alone
repeated
grace
emphatically
i
go
to
my
own
room
i
said
to
my
mother
i
am
afraid
you
can
not
martin
she
answered
hesitatingly
miss
daltrey
has
taken
possession
of
it
and
she
has
not
removed
all
her
things
yet
she
and
julia
did
not
leave
till
late
last
night
you
must
go
to
the
spare
room
i
thought
you
would
have
kept
my
room
for
me
mother
i
said
reproachfully
so
i
would
she
replied
her
lips
quivering
but
miss
daltrey
took
a
fancy
to
it
and
your
father
and
julia
made
a
point
of
indulging
her
i
really
think
julia
would
have
had
every
thing
belonging
to
you
swept
into
the
streets
it
was
very
hard
for
me
martin
i
was
ten
times
more
vexed
than
you
are
to
give
up
your
room
to
miss
daltrey
it
was
my
only
comfort
to
go
and
sit
there
and
think
of
my
dear
boy
never
mind
never
mind
i
answered
i
am
at
home
now
and
you
will
never
be
left
alone
with
them
again
nevermore
mother
i
retreated
to
the
spare
room
fully
satisfied
that
i
should
dislike
miss
daltrey
quite
as
much
as
my
mother
could
wish
finding
that
julia
prolonged
her
visit
downstairs
i
went
out
after
a
while
for
a
stroll
in
the
old
garden
where
the
trees
and
shrubs
had
grown
with
my
growth
and
were
as
familiar
as
human
friends
to
me
i
visited
madam
in
her
stall
and
had
a
talk
with
old
pellet
and
generally
established
my
footing
once
more
as
the
only
son
of
the
house
not
at
all
either
as
if
i
were
a
prodigal
son
come
home
repentant
i
was
resolved
not
to
play
that
for
had
i
not
been
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
my
father
came
in
to
dinner
but
like
a
true
man
of
the
world
he
received
me
back
on
civil
and
equal
terms
not
alluding
beyond
a
word
or
two
to
my
long
absence
we
began
again
as
friends
and
our
mutual
knowledge
of
my
mother
fatal
malady
softened
our
hearts
and
manners
toward
one
another
whenever
he
was
he
waited
upon
her
with
sedulous
attention
but
for
the
certainty
that
death
was
lurking
very
near
to
us
i
should
have
been
happier
in
my
home
than
i
had
ever
been
since
that
momentous
week
in
sark
but
i
was
also
nearer
to
olivia
and
every
throb
of
my
pulse
was
quickened
by
the
mere
thought
of
that
chapter
the
a
new
patient
in
one
sense
time
seemed
to
be
standing
still
with
me
so
like
were
the
days
that
followed
the
one
to
the
other
but
in
another
sense
those
days
fled
with
awful
swiftness
for
they
were
hurrying
us
both
my
mother
and
me
to
a
great
gulf
which
would
soon
far
too
soon
lie
between
us
every
afternoon
julia
came
to
spend
an
hour
or
two
with
my
mother
but
her
arrival
was
always
formally
announced
and
it
was
an
understood
thing
that
i
should
immediately
quit
the
room
to
avoid
meeting
her
there
was
an
etiquette
in
her
resentment
which
i
was
bound
to
observe
what
our
circle
of
friends
thought
had
become
a
matter
of
very
secondary
consideration
to
me
but
there
seemed
a
general
disposition
to
condone
my
offences
in
view
of
the
calamity
that
was
hanging
by
a
mere
thread
above
me
i
discovered
from
their
significant
remarks
that
it
had
been
quite
the
fashion
to
visit
sark
during
the
summer
by
the
queen
of
the
isles
which
made
the
passage
every
monday
and
that
cottage
had
been
an
object
of
attraction
to
many
of
my
relatives
of
every
degree
few
of
them
had
caught
even
a
glimpse
of
olivia
and
i
suspected
that
she
had
kept
herself
well
out
of
sight
on
those
days
when
the
weekly
steamer
flooded
the
island
with
visitors
i
had
not
taken
up
any
of
my
old
patients
again
for
i
was
determined
that
everybody
should
feel
that
my
residence
at
home
was
only
temporary
but
about
ten
days
after
my
return
the
following
note
was
brought
to
me
directed
in
full
to
martin
dobrée
a
lady
from
england
who
is
only
a
visitor
in
guernsey
will
be
much
obliged
by
martin
dobrée
calling
upon
her
at
rose
villa
vauvert
road
she
is
suffering
from
a
slight
indisposition
and
knowing
senior
by
name
and
reputation
she
would
feel
great
confidence
in
the
skill
of
senior
friend
i
wondered
for
an
instant
who
the
stranger
could
be
and
how
she
knew
the
seniors
but
as
there
could
be
no
answer
to
these
queries
without
visiting
the
lady
i
resolved
to
go
rose
villa
was
a
house
where
the
rooms
were
let
to
visitors
during
the
season
and
the
vauvert
road
was
scarcely
five
minutes
walk
from
our
house
julia
was
paying
her
daily
visit
to
my
mother
and
i
was
at
a
loss
for
something
to
do
so
i
went
at
once
i
found
a
very
handsome
woman
dark
with
hair
and
eyes
as
black
as
a
gypsy
and
a
clear
olive
complexion
to
match
her
forehead
was
low
but
smooth
and
and
the
lower
part
of
her
face
handsome
as
it
was
was
far
more
developed
than
the
upper
there
was
not
a
trace
of
refinement
about
her
features
yet
the
coarseness
of
them
was
but
slightly
apparent
as
yet
she
did
not
strike
me
as
having
more
than
a
very
slight
ailment
indeed
though
she
dilated
fluently
about
her
symptoms
and
affected
to
be
afraid
of
fever
it
is
not
always
possible
to
deny
that
a
woman
has
a
violent
headache
but
where
the
pulse
is
all
right
and
the
tongue
clean
it
is
clear
enough
that
there
is
not
any
thing
very
serious
threatening
her
my
new
patient
did
not
inspire
me
with
much
sympathy
but
she
attracted
my
curiosity
and
interested
me
by
the
bold
style
of
her
beauty
you
guernsey
people
are
very
stiff
with
strangers
she
remarked
as
i
sat
opposite
to
her
regarding
her
with
that
close
observation
which
is
permitted
to
a
doctor
so
the
world
says
i
answered
of
course
i
am
no
good
judge
for
we
guernsey
people
believe
ourselves
as
perfect
as
any
class
of
the
human
family
certainly
we
pride
ourselves
on
being
a
little
more
difficult
of
approach
than
the
jersey
people
strangers
are
more
freely
welcome
there
than
here
unless
they
bring
introductions
with
them
if
you
have
any
introductions
you
will
find
guernsey
as
hospitable
a
spot
as
any
in
the
world
i
have
been
here
a
week
she
replied
pouting
her
full
crimson
lips
and
have
not
had
a
chance
of
speaking
a
word
except
to
strangers
like
myself
who
do
know
a
soul
that
then
was
the
cause
of
the
little
indisposition
which
had
obtained
me
the
honor
of
attending
her
i
indulged
myself
in
a
mild
sarcasm
to
that
effect
but
it
was
lost
upon
her
she
gazed
at
me
solemnly
with
her
large
black
eyes
which
shone
like
beads
i
am
really
ill
she
said
but
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
not
seeing
anybody
though
that
dull
there
nothing
for
me
to
do
but
take
a
bath
in
the
morning
and
a
drive
in
the
afternoon
and
go
to
bed
very
early
good
gracious
it
enough
to
drive
me
mad
try
jersey
i
suggested
no
i
not
try
jersey
she
said
i
mean
to
make
my
way
here
you
know
anybody
doctor
that
would
take
pity
on
a
poor
stranger
i
am
sorry
to
say
no
i
answered
she
frowned
at
that
and
looked
disappointed
i
was
about
to
ask
her
how
she
knew
the
seniors
when
she
spoke
again
do
you
have
many
visitors
come
to
guernsey
late
in
the
autumn
as
late
as
october
she
inquired
not
many
i
answered
a
few
may
arrive
who
intend
to
winter
here
a
dear
young
friend
of
mine
came
here
last
autumn
she
said
alone
as
i
am
and
i
been
wondering
ever
since
i
been
here
however
she
would
get
along
among
such
a
set
of
stiff
formal
folks
she
had
not
money
enough
for
a
dash
or
that
would
make
a
difference
i
suppose
not
the
least
i
replied
if
your
friend
came
without
any
introductions
what
a
dreary
winter
she
have
pursued
my
patient
with
a
tone
of
exultation
she
was
quite
young
and
as
pretty
as
a
picture
all
the
young
men
would
know
her
i
be
bound
and
you
among
them
martin
any
woman
who
is
a
fright
gets
stared
at
enough
to
be
known
again
could
this
woman
know
any
thing
of
olivia
i
looked
at
her
more
earnestly
and
critically
she
was
not
a
person
i
should
like
olivia
to
have
any
thing
to
do
with
a
coarse
bold
woman
whose
eyes
met
mine
unabashed
and
did
not
blink
under
my
scrutiny
could
she
be
olivia
who
had
been
the
ruin
of
her
life
i
bet
a
hundred
to
one
you
know
her
she
said
laughing
and
showing
all
her
white
teeth
a
girl
like
her
could
go
about
a
little
poky
place
like
this
without
all
the
young
men
knowing
her
perhaps
she
left
the
island
in
the
spring
i
have
asked
at
all
the
drapers
shops
but
nobody
recollects
her
i
very
good
news
for
her
if
i
could
find
her
a
slim
girl
with
a
clear
fair
skin
and
gray
eyes
and
hair
of
a
bright
brown
stay
i
can
show
you
her
photograph
she
put
into
my
hands
an
exquisite
portrait
of
olivia
taken
in
florence
there
was
an
expression
of
quiet
mournfulness
in
the
face
which
touched
me
to
the
core
of
my
heart
i
could
not
put
it
down
and
speak
indifferently
about
it
my
heart
beat
wildly
and
i
felt
tempted
to
run
off
with
the
treasure
and
return
no
more
to
this
woman
ah
you
recognize
her
she
exclaimed
triumphantly
i
never
saw
such
a
person
in
guernsey
i
answered
looking
steadily
into
her
face
a
sullen
and
gloomy
expression
came
across
it
and
she
snatched
the
portrait
out
of
my
hand
you
want
to
keep
it
a
secret
she
said
but
i
defy
you
to
do
it
i
am
come
here
to
find
her
and
find
her
i
will
she
has
drowned
herself
and
the
earth
has
swallowed
her
up
i
traced
her
as
far
as
here
and
that
i
tell
you
she
crossed
in
the
southampton
boat
one
dreadfully
stormy
night
last
october
the
only
lady
passenger
and
the
stewardess
recollects
her
well
she
landed
here
you
must
know
something
about
her
i
assure
you
i
never
saw
that
girl
here
i
replied
evasively
what
inquiries
have
you
made
after
her
i
inquired
here
and
there
and
everywhere
she
said
i
done
nothing
else
ever
since
i
came
it
is
of
great
importance
to
her
as
well
as
to
me
that
i
should
find
her
it
a
very
anxious
thing
when
a
girl
like
that
disappears
and
is
never
heard
of
again
all
because
she
has
a
little
difference
with
her
friends
if
you
could
help
me
to
find
her
you
would
do
her
family
a
very
great
service
why
do
you
fix
upon
me
i
inquired
why
did
you
not
send
for
one
of
the
resident
doctors
i
left
guernsey
some
time
ago
you
were
here
last
winter
she
said
and
you
a
young
man
and
would
notice
her
more
there
are
other
young
doctors
in
guernsey
i
remarked
ah
but
you
been
in
london
she
answered
and
i
know
something
of
senior
when
you
are
in
a
strange
place
you
catch
at
any
chance
of
an
acquaintance
come
be
candid
with
me
i
said
did
not
scott
and
brown
send
you
here
the
suddenness
of
my
question
took
her
off
her
guard
and
startled
her
she
hesitated
stammered
and
finally
denied
it
with
more
than
natural
emphasis
i
could
take
my
oath
i
do
know
any
such
persons
she
answered
i
do
know
whom
you
mean
or
what
you
mean
all
i
want
is
quite
honest
there
is
a
fortune
waiting
for
that
poor
girl
and
i
want
to
take
her
back
to
those
who
love
her
and
are
ready
to
forgive
and
forget
every
thing
i
feel
sure
you
know
something
of
her
but
no
body
except
me
and
her
other
friends
have
any
thing
to
do
with
it
well
i
said
rising
to
take
my
leave
all
the
information
i
can
give
you
is
that
i
never
saw
such
a
person
here
either
last
winter
or
since
it
is
quite
possible
she
went
on
to
jersey
or
to
granville
when
the
storm
was
over
that
she
did
not
stay
in
guernsey
i
am
quite
sure
i
went
away
in
a
fever
of
anxiety
the
woman
who
was
certainly
not
a
lady
had
inspired
me
with
a
repugnance
that
i
could
not
describe
there
was
an
ingrain
coarseness
about
her
a
vulgarity
excessively
distasteful
to
me
as
in
any
way
connected
with
olivia
the
mystery
which
surrounded
her
was
made
the
deeper
by
it
surely
this
person
could
not
be
related
to
olivia
i
tried
to
guess
in
what
relationship
to
her
she
could
possibly
stand
there
was
the
indefinable
delicacy
and
refinement
of
a
lady
altogether
independent
of
her
surroundings
so
apparent
in
olivia
that
i
could
not
imagine
her
as
connected
by
blood
with
this
woman
yet
why
and
how
should
such
a
person
have
any
right
to
pursue
her
i
felt
more
chafed
than
i
had
ever
done
about
olivia
secret
i
tried
to
satisfy
myself
with
the
reflection
that
i
had
put
tardif
on
his
guard
and
that
he
would
protect
her
but
that
did
not
set
my
mind
at
ease
i
never
knew
a
mother
yet
who
believed
that
any
other
woman
could
nurse
her
sick
child
as
well
as
herself
and
i
could
not
be
persuaded
that
even
tardif
would
shield
olivia
from
danger
and
trouble
as
i
could
if
i
were
only
allowed
the
privilege
yet
my
promise
to
julia
bound
me
to
hold
no
communication
with
her
besides
this
was
surely
no
time
to
occupy
myself
with
any
other
woman
in
the
world
than
my
mother
she
herself
good
and
amiable
and
as
she
was
might
feel
a
pang
of
jealousy
and
i
ought
not
to
be
the
one
to
add
a
single
drop
of
bitterness
to
the
cup
she
was
drinking
on
the
other
hand
i
was
distracted
at
the
thought
that
this
stranger
might
discover
the
place
of
olivia
retreat
from
which
there
was
no
chance
of
escape
if
it
were
once
discovered
a
like
sark
becomes
a
trap
as
soon
as
it
is
traced
out
should
this
woman
catch
the
echo
of
those
rumors
which
had
circulated
so
widely
through
guernsey
less
than
three
months
ago
and
any
chance
conversation
with
one
of
our
own
people
might
bring
them
to
her
ears
then
farewell
to
safety
and
concealment
here
was
the
squall
which
had
been
foretold
by
jack
i
cursed
the
idle
curiosity
of
mine
which
had
exposed
her
to
this
danger
i
had
strolled
down
some
of
the
quieter
streets
of
the
town
while
i
was
turning
this
affair
over
in
my
mind
and
now
as
i
crossed
the
end
of
rue
haute
i
caught
sight
of
kate
daltrey
turning
into
a
shop
there
was
every
reasonable
probability
that
she
would
not
come
out
again
soon
for
i
saw
a
bonnet
reached
out
of
the
window
if
she
were
gone
to
buy
a
bonnet
she
was
safe
for
half
an
hour
and
julia
would
be
alone
i
had
felt
a
strong
desire
to
see
julia
ever
since
i
returned
home
my
mind
was
made
up
on
the
spot
i
knew
her
so
well
as
to
be
certain
that
if
i
found
her
in
a
gentle
mood
she
would
at
any
rate
release
me
from
the
promise
she
had
extorted
from
me
when
she
was
in
the
first
heat
of
her
anger
and
disappointment
it
was
a
chance
worth
trying
if
i
were
free
to
declare
to
olivia
my
love
for
her
i
should
establish
a
claim
upon
her
full
confidence
and
we
could
laugh
at
further
difficulties
she
was
of
age
and
therefore
mistress
of
herself
her
friends
represented
by
this
odious
woman
could
have
no
legal
authority
over
her
i
turned
shortly
up
a
and
walked
as
fast
as
i
could
toward
the
house
which
was
to
have
been
our
home
by
a
bold
stroke
i
might
reach
julia
presence
i
rang
and
the
maid
who
answered
the
bell
opened
wide
eyes
of
astonishment
at
seeing
me
there
i
passed
by
quickly
i
wish
to
speak
to
miss
dobrée
i
said
is
she
in
the
yes
sir
she
answered
in
a
hesitating
tone
i
waited
for
nothing
more
but
knocked
at
the
door
for
myself
and
heard
julia
call
come
in
chapter
the
set
free
julia
looked
very
much
the
same
as
she
had
done
that
evening
when
i
came
reluctantly
to
tell
her
that
my
heart
was
not
in
her
keeping
but
belonged
to
another
she
wore
the
same
kind
of
fresh
light
muslin
dress
with
ribbons
and
lace
about
it
and
she
sat
near
the
window
with
a
piece
of
in
her
hands
yet
she
was
not
sewing
and
her
hands
lay
listlessly
on
her
lap
but
for
this
attitude
of
dejection
i
could
have
imagined
that
it
was
the
same
day
and
the
same
hour
and
that
she
was
still
ignorant
of
the
change
in
my
feelings
toward
her
if
it
had
not
been
for
our
perverse
fate
we
should
now
be
returning
from
our
and
receiving
the
congratulations
of
our
friends
a
mingled
feeling
of
sorrow
pity
and
shame
prevented
me
from
advancing
into
the
room
she
looked
up
to
see
who
was
standing
in
the
doorway
and
my
appearance
there
evidently
alarmed
and
distressed
her
martin
she
cried
may
i
come
in
and
speak
to
you
julia
i
asked
is
my
aunt
worse
she
inquired
hurriedly
are
you
come
to
fetch
me
to
her
no
no
julia
i
said
my
mother
is
as
well
as
usual
i
hope
but
surely
you
will
let
me
speak
to
you
after
all
this
time
it
is
not
a
long
time
she
answered
has
it
not
been
long
to
you
i
asked
it
seems
years
to
me
all
life
has
changed
for
me
i
had
no
idea
then
of
my
mother
illness
nor
i
she
said
sighing
deeply
if
i
had
known
it
i
continued
all
this
might
not
have
happened
surely
the
troubles
i
shall
have
to
bear
must
plead
with
you
for
me
yes
martin
she
answered
yes
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
she
came
forward
and
offered
me
her
hand
but
without
looking
into
my
face
i
saw
that
she
had
been
crying
for
her
eyes
were
red
in
a
tone
of
formal
politeness
she
asked
me
if
i
would
not
sit
down
i
considered
it
best
to
remain
standing
as
an
intimation
that
i
should
not
trouble
her
with
my
presence
for
long
my
mother
loves
you
very
dearly
julia
i
ventured
to
say
after
a
long
pause
which
she
did
not
seem
inclined
to
break
i
had
no
time
to
lose
lest
kate
daltrey
should
come
in
and
it
was
a
very
difficult
subject
to
approach
not
more
than
i
love
her
she
said
warmly
aunt
dobrée
has
been
as
good
to
me
as
any
mother
could
have
been
i
love
her
as
dearly
as
my
mother
have
you
seen
her
since
i
was
with
her
this
afternoon
no
i
have
just
come
from
visiting
a
very
curious
patient
and
have
not
been
home
yet
i
hoped
julia
would
catch
at
the
word
curious
and
make
some
inquiries
which
would
open
a
way
for
me
but
she
seemed
not
to
hear
it
and
another
silence
fell
upon
us
both
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
utter
a
syllable
of
what
i
had
come
to
say
we
were
talking
of
you
she
said
at
length
in
a
harried
and
thick
voice
aunt
is
in
great
sorrow
about
you
it
preys
upon
her
day
and
night
that
you
will
be
dreadfully
alone
when
she
is
gone
and
and
martin
she
wishes
to
know
before
she
dies
that
the
girl
in
sark
will
become
your
wife
the
word
struck
like
a
shot
upon
my
ear
and
brain
what
had
julia
and
my
mother
been
arranging
between
them
my
happiness
and
olivia
safety
that
very
afternoon
such
generosity
was
incredible
i
could
not
believe
i
had
heard
aright
she
has
seen
the
girl
continued
julia
in
the
same
husky
tone
which
she
could
not
compel
to
be
clear
and
calm
and
she
is
convinced
she
is
no
adventuress
johanna
says
the
same
they
tell
me
it
is
unreasonable
and
selfish
in
me
to
doom
you
to
the
dreadful
loneliness
i
feel
if
aunt
dobrée
asked
me
to
pluck
out
my
right
eye
just
now
i
could
not
refuse
it
is
something
like
that
but
i
have
promised
to
do
it
i
release
you
from
every
promise
you
ever
made
to
me
martin
julia
i
cried
crossing
to
her
and
bending
over
her
with
more
love
and
admiration
than
i
had
ever
felt
before
this
is
very
noble
very
generous
no
she
said
bursting
into
tears
i
am
neither
noble
nor
generous
i
do
it
because
i
can
not
help
myself
with
aunt
white
face
looking
so
imploringly
at
me
i
do
not
give
you
up
willingly
to
that
girl
in
sark
i
hope
i
shall
never
see
her
or
you
for
many
many
years
aunt
says
you
will
have
no
chance
of
marrying
her
till
you
are
settled
in
a
practice
somewhere
but
you
are
free
to
ask
her
to
be
your
wife
aunt
wants
you
to
have
somebody
to
love
you
and
care
for
you
after
she
is
gone
as
i
should
have
done
but
you
are
generous
to
consent
to
it
i
said
again
so
she
answered
wiping
her
eyes
and
lifting
up
her
head
i
thought
i
was
generous
i
thought
i
was
a
christian
but
it
is
not
easy
to
be
a
christian
when
one
is
mortified
and
humbled
and
wounded
i
am
a
great
disappointment
to
myself
quite
as
great
as
you
are
to
me
i
fancied
myself
very
superior
to
what
i
am
i
hope
you
may
not
be
disappointed
in
that
girl
in
sark
the
latter
words
were
not
spoken
in
an
amiable
tone
but
this
was
no
time
for
criticising
julia
she
had
made
a
tremendous
sacrifice
that
was
evident
and
a
whole
sacrifice
without
any
blemish
is
very
rarely
offered
up
nowadays
however
it
may
have
been
in
olden
times
i
could
not
look
at
her
dejected
face
and
gloomy
expression
without
a
keen
sense
of
julia
i
said
i
shall
never
be
quite
happy
no
not
with
olivia
as
my
wife
unless
you
and
i
are
friends
we
have
grown
up
together
too
much
as
brother
and
sister
for
me
to
have
you
taken
right
out
of
my
life
without
a
feeling
of
great
loss
it
is
i
who
would
lose
a
right
hand
or
a
right
eye
in
losing
you
some
day
we
must
be
friends
again
as
we
used
to
be
it
is
not
very
likely
she
answered
but
you
had
better
go
now
martin
it
is
very
painful
to
me
for
you
to
be
here
i
could
not
stay
any
longer
after
that
dismissal
her
hand
was
lying
on
her
lap
and
i
stooped
down
and
kissed
it
seeing
on
it
still
the
ring
i
had
given
her
when
we
were
first
engaged
she
did
not
look
at
me
or
bid
me
and
i
went
out
of
the
house
my
veins
tingling
with
shame
and
gladness
i
met
captain
carey
coming
up
the
street
with
a
basket
of
fine
grapes
in
his
hand
he
appeared
very
much
amazed
why
martin
he
exclaimed
can
you
have
been
to
see
julia
yes
i
answered
reconciled
he
said
arching
his
eyebrows
which
were
still
dark
and
bushy
though
his
hair
was
grizzled
not
exactly
i
replied
with
a
stiff
smile
exceedingly
difficult
to
force
nothing
of
the
sort
indeed
captain
when
will
you
take
me
across
to
sark
come
come
none
of
that
martin
he
said
you
on
honor
you
know
you
are
pledged
to
poor
julia
not
to
visit
sark
again
she
has
just
set
me
free
i
answered
and
out
of
the
fulness
of
my
heart
i
told
him
all
that
had
just
passed
between
us
his
eyes
glistened
though
a
film
came
across
them
which
he
had
to
wipe
away
she
is
a
noble
girl
he
ejaculated
a
fine
generous
noble
girl
i
really
thought
she
break
her
heart
over
you
at
first
but
she
will
come
round
again
now
we
will
have
a
run
over
to
sark
i
felt
myself
lifted
into
a
third
heaven
of
delight
all
that
evening
my
mother
and
i
talked
of
no
one
but
olivia
the
present
rapture
so
completely
eclipsed
the
coming
sorrow
that
i
forgot
how
soon
it
would
be
upon
me
i
remember
now
that
my
mother
neither
by
word
nor
sign
suffered
me
to
be
reminded
of
her
illness
she
listened
to
my
rhapsodies
smiling
with
her
divine
pathetic
smile
there
is
no
love
no
love
at
all
like
that
of
a
mother
chapter
the
a
bright
beginning
not
the
next
day
which
was
wet
and
windy
but
the
day
following
did
captain
carey
take
me
over
to
sark
i
had
had
time
to
talk
over
all
my
plans
for
the
future
with
my
mother
and
i
bore
with
me
many
messages
from
her
to
the
girl
i
was
about
to
ask
to
become
my
wife
coxcomb
as
i
was
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
i
could
win
olivia
to
explain
my
coxcombry
is
not
a
very
easy
task
i
do
not
suppose
i
had
a
much
higher
sense
of
my
own
merits
than
such
as
is
common
to
man
i
admit
i
was
neither
shy
nor
nervous
on
the
one
hand
but
on
the
other
i
was
not
blatantly
it
is
possible
that
my
course
through
life
hitherto
first
as
an
only
son
adored
by
his
mother
and
secondly
as
an
exceedingly
eligible
in
a
circle
where
there
were
very
few
young
men
of
my
rank
and
family
and
where
there
were
twenty
or
more
marriageable
women
to
one
unmarried
man
had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
my
feeling
of
security
with
regard
to
this
unknown
poor
and
friendless
stranger
but
added
to
this
there
was
olivia
own
frank
unconcealed
pleasure
in
seeing
me
whenever
i
had
had
a
chance
of
visiting
her
and
the
freedom
with
which
she
had
always
conversed
with
me
upon
any
topic
except
that
of
her
own
mysterious
position
i
was
sure
i
had
made
a
favorable
impression
upon
her
in
fact
when
i
had
been
talking
with
her
i
had
given
utterance
to
brighter
and
clearer
thoughts
than
i
had
ever
been
conscious
of
before
a
word
from
her
a
simple
question
seemed
to
touch
the
spring
of
some
hidden
treasure
of
my
brain
and
i
had
surprised
myself
by
what
i
had
been
enabled
to
say
to
her
it
was
this
probably
more
than
her
beauty
which
had
drawn
me
to
her
and
made
me
happy
in
her
companionship
no
i
had
never
shown
myself
contemptible
but
quite
the
reverse
in
her
presence
no
doubt
or
misgiving
assailed
me
as
the
yacht
carried
us
out
of
harbor
swiftly
we
ran
across
with
a
soft
wind
drifting
over
the
sea
and
playing
upon
our
faces
and
a
long
furrow
lying
in
the
wake
of
our
boat
it
was
almost
low
tide
when
we
reached
the
island
the
best
time
for
seeing
the
cliffs
they
were
standing
well
out
of
the
water
scarred
and
chiselled
with
strange
devices
and
glowing
in
the
august
sunlight
with
tints
of
the
most
gorgeous
coloring
while
their
feet
swathed
with
brown
seaweed
were
glistening
with
the
dashing
of
the
waves
i
had
seen
nothing
like
them
since
i
had
been
there
last
and
the
view
of
these
wild
rugged
crags
with
their
regal
robes
of
amber
and
gold
and
silver
almost
oppressed
me
with
delight
if
i
could
but
see
olivia
on
this
summit
the
currents
and
the
wind
had
been
in
favor
of
our
running
through
the
channel
between
sark
and
jethou
and
so
landing
at
the
creux
harbor
on
the
opposite
coast
of
the
island
to
the
havre
gosselin
i
crossed
in
headlong
haste
for
i
was
afraid
of
meeting
with
julia
friends
or
some
of
my
own
acquaintances
who
were
spending
the
summer
months
there
i
found
tardif
house
completely
deserted
the
only
sign
of
life
was
a
family
of
hens
clucking
about
the
fold
the
door
was
not
fastened
and
i
entered
but
there
was
nobody
there
i
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
kitchen
and
called
but
there
was
no
answer
olivia
door
was
ajar
and
i
pushed
it
a
little
more
open
there
lay
books
i
had
lent
her
on
the
table
and
her
velvet
slippers
were
on
the
floor
as
if
they
had
only
just
been
taken
off
very
worn
and
brown
were
the
little
slippers
but
they
reassured
me
she
had
been
wearing
them
a
short
time
ago
i
returned
through
the
fold
and
mounted
the
bank
that
sheltered
the
house
to
see
if
i
could
discover
any
trace
of
her
or
tardif
or
his
mother
all
the
place
seemed
left
to
itself
tardif
sheep
were
browsing
along
the
cliffs
and
his
cows
were
tethered
here
and
there
but
nobody
appeared
to
be
tending
them
at
last
i
caught
sight
of
a
head
rising
from
behind
a
crag
the
rough
shock
head
of
a
boy
and
i
shouted
to
him
making
a
trumpet
with
my
hands
where
is
neighbor
tardif
i
called
down
below
there
he
shouted
back
again
pointing
downward
to
the
havre
gosselin
i
did
not
wait
for
any
further
information
but
darted
off
down
the
long
steep
gulley
to
the
little
strand
where
the
pebbles
were
being
lapped
lazily
by
the
ripple
of
the
lowering
tide
boat
was
within
a
stone
throw
and
i
saw
olivia
sitting
in
the
stern
of
it
i
shouted
again
with
a
vehemence
which
made
them
both
start
come
back
tardif
i
cried
and
take
me
with
you
the
boat
was
too
far
off
for
me
to
see
how
my
sudden
appearance
affected
olivia
did
she
turn
white
or
red
at
the
sound
of
my
voice
by
the
time
it
neared
the
shore
and
i
plunged
in
to
meet
it
her
face
was
bright
with
smiles
and
her
hands
were
stretched
out
to
help
me
over
the
boat
side
if
tardif
had
not
been
there
i
should
have
kissed
them
both
as
it
was
i
tucked
up
my
wet
legs
out
of
reach
of
her
dress
and
took
an
oar
unable
to
utter
a
word
of
the
gladness
i
felt
i
recovered
myself
in
a
few
seconds
and
touched
her
hand
and
grasped
tardif
with
almost
as
much
force
as
he
gripped
mine
where
are
you
going
to
i
asked
addressing
neither
of
them
in
particular
tardif
was
going
to
row
me
past
the
entrance
to
the
gouliot
caves
answered
olivia
but
we
will
put
it
off
now
we
will
return
to
the
shore
and
hear
all
your
adventures
martin
you
come
upon
us
like
a
phantom
and
take
an
oar
in
ghostly
silence
are
you
really
truly
there
i
am
no
phantom
i
said
touching
her
hand
again
no
we
will
not
go
back
to
the
shore
tardif
shall
row
us
to
the
caves
and
i
will
take
you
into
them
and
then
we
two
will
return
along
the
cliffs
would
you
like
that
very
much
she
answered
the
smile
still
playing
about
her
face
it
was
brown
and
freckled
with
exposure
to
the
sun
but
so
full
of
health
and
life
as
to
be
doubly
beautiful
to
me
who
saw
so
many
wan
and
sickly
faces
there
was
a
bloom
and
freshness
about
her
telling
of
pure
air
and
peaceful
hours
and
days
spent
in
the
sunshine
i
was
seated
on
the
bench
before
tardif
with
my
back
to
him
and
olivia
was
in
front
of
me
she
and
the
gorgeous
cliffs
and
the
glistening
sea
and
the
cloudless
sky
overhead
no
there
is
no
language
on
earth
that
could
paint
the
rapture
of
that
moment
doctor
said
tardif
deep
grave
voice
behind
me
your
mother
is
she
better
it
was
like
the
sharp
prick
of
a
poniard
which
presently
you
knew
must
pierce
your
heart
the
one
moment
of
rapture
had
fled
the
paradise
that
had
been
about
me
for
an
instant
with
no
hint
of
pain
faded
out
of
my
sight
but
olivia
remained
and
her
face
grew
sad
and
her
voice
low
and
sorrowful
as
she
leaned
forward
to
speak
to
me
i
have
been
so
grieved
for
you
she
said
your
mother
came
to
see
me
once
and
promised
to
be
my
friend
is
it
true
is
she
so
very
ill
quite
true
i
answered
in
a
choking
voice
we
said
no
more
for
some
minutes
and
the
splash
of
the
oars
in
the
water
was
the
only
sound
olivia
air
continued
sad
and
her
eyes
were
downcast
as
if
she
shrank
from
looking
me
in
the
face
pardon
me
doctor
said
tardif
in
our
own
dialect
which
olivia
could
not
understand
i
have
made
you
sorry
when
you
were
having
a
little
gladness
is
your
mother
very
ill
there
is
no
hope
tardif
i
answered
looking
round
at
his
honest
and
handsome
face
full
of
concern
for
me
may
i
speak
to
you
as
an
old
friend
he
asked
you
love
and
you
are
come
to
tell
her
so
what
makes
you
think
that
i
said
i
see
it
in
your
face
he
answered
lowering
his
voice
though
he
knew
olivia
could
not
tell
what
we
were
saying
your
marriage
with
mademoiselle
your
cousin
was
broken
off
why
do
you
suppose
i
did
not
guess
i
knew
it
from
the
you
stayed
with
us
nobody
could
see
as
we
see
her
without
loving
her
the
sark
folks
say
you
are
in
love
with
her
yourself
tardif
i
said
almost
against
my
will
and
certainly
without
any
intention
beforehand
of
giving
expression
to
such
a
rumor
his
lips
contracted
and
his
face
saddened
but
he
met
my
eyes
frankly
it
is
true
he
answered
but
what
then
if
it
had
only
pleased
god
to
make
me
like
you
or
that
she
should
be
of
my
class
i
would
have
done
my
utmost
to
win
her
but
that
is
impossible
see
i
am
nothing
else
than
a
servant
in
her
eyes
i
do
not
know
how
to
be
any
thing
else
and
i
am
content
she
is
as
far
above
my
reach
as
one
of
the
white
clouds
up
yonder
to
think
of
myself
as
any
thing
but
her
servant
would
be
irreligious
you
are
a
good
fellow
tardif
i
exclaimed
god
is
the
judge
of
that
he
said
with
a
sigh
thinks
of
me
only
as
her
servant
good
tardif
do
this
or
do
that
i
like
it
i
do
not
know
any
happier
moment
than
when
i
hold
her
little
boots
in
my
hand
and
brush
them
you
see
she
is
as
helpless
and
tender
as
my
little
wife
was
but
she
is
very
much
higher
than
my
poor
little
wife
yes
i
love
her
as
i
love
the
blue
sky
and
the
white
clouds
and
the
stars
shining
in
the
night
but
it
will
be
quite
different
between
her
and
you
i
hope
so
i
thought
to
myself
you
do
not
feel
like
a
servant
he
continued
his
oars
dipping
a
little
too
deeply
and
setting
the
boat
when
you
are
married
she
will
look
up
to
you
and
obey
you
i
do
not
understand
altogether
why
the
good
god
has
made
this
difference
between
us
two
but
i
see
it
and
feel
it
it
would
be
fitting
for
you
to
be
her
husband
it
would
be
a
shame
to
her
to
become
my
wife
are
you
grieved
about
it
tardif
i
asked
no
no
he
answered
we
have
always
been
good
friends
you
and
i
doctor
no
you
shall
marry
her
and
i
will
be
happy
i
will
come
to
visit
you
sometimes
and
she
will
call
me
her
good
tardif
that
is
enough
for
me
what
are
you
talking
about
asked
olivia
it
was
impossible
to
tell
her
or
to
continue
the
conversation
moreover
the
narrow
channel
between
breckhou
and
sark
is
so
strong
in
its
current
that
it
required
both
caution
and
skill
to
steer
the
boat
amid
the
points
of
the
rocks
at
last
we
gained
one
of
the
entrances
to
the
caves
but
we
could
not
pull
the
boat
quite
up
to
the
strand
a
few
paces
of
shallow
water
clear
as
glass
with
pebbles
sparkling
like
gems
beneath
it
lay
between
us
and
the
caves
tardif
i
said
you
need
not
wait
for
us
we
will
return
by
the
cliffs
you
know
the
gouliot
caves
as
well
as
i
do
he
replied
though
in
a
doubtful
tone
all
right
i
said
as
i
swung
over
the
side
of
the
boat
into
the
water
when
i
found
myself
olivia
looked
from
me
to
tardif
with
a
flushed
face
an
augury
that
made
my
pulses
leap
why
should
her
face
never
change
when
he
carried
her
in
his
arms
why
should
she
shrink
from
me
are
you
as
strong
as
tardif
she
asked
lingering
and
hesitating
before
she
would
trust
herself
to
me
almost
if
not
altogether
i
answered
gayly
i
strong
enough
to
undertake
to
carry
you
without
wetting
the
soles
of
your
feet
come
it
is
not
more
than
half
a
dozen
yards
she
was
standing
on
the
bench
i
had
just
left
looking
down
at
me
with
the
same
vivid
flush
upon
her
cheeks
and
forehead
and
with
an
uneasy
expression
in
her
eyes
before
she
could
speak
again
i
put
my
arms
round
her
and
lifted
her
down
you
are
quite
as
light
as
a
feather
i
said
laughing
as
i
carried
her
to
the
strip
of
moist
and
humid
strand
under
the
archway
in
the
rocks
as
i
put
her
down
i
looked
back
to
tardif
and
saw
him
regarding
us
with
grave
and
sorrowful
eyes
adieu
he
cried
i
am
going
to
look
after
my
god
bless
you
both
he
spoke
the
last
words
heartily
and
we
stood
watching
him
as
long
as
he
was
in
sight
then
we
went
on
into
the
caves
chapter
the
the
gouliot
caves
olivia
was
very
silent
the
coast
of
sark
shows
some
of
the
most
fantastic
workmanship
of
the
sea
but
the
gouliot
caves
are
its
wildest
and
maddest
freak
a
strong
swift
current
sets
in
from
the
southwest
and
being
lashed
into
a
giddy
fury
by
the
lightest
southwest
wind
it
has
hewn
out
of
the
rock
a
series
of
cells
and
grottos
and
alcoves
some
of
them
running
far
inland
in
long
vaulted
passages
and
corridors
with
now
and
then
a
shaft
or
funnel
in
the
rocky
roof
through
which
the
light
streams
down
into
recesses
far
from
the
low
porches
which
open
from
the
sea
here
and
there
a
crooked
twisted
tunnel
forms
a
skylight
overhead
and
the
blue
heavens
look
down
through
it
like
a
eye
you
can
not
number
the
caverns
and
niches
everywhere
the
sea
has
bored
alleys
and
galleries
or
hewn
out
solemn
aisles
with
arches
intersecting
each
other
and
running
off
into
capricious
furrows
and
mouldings
there
are
innumerable
refts
and
channels
and
crescents
and
cupolas
or
only
hinted
at
there
are
chambers
of
every
height
and
shape
leading
into
one
another
by
irregular
portals
but
all
rough
and
rude
as
though
there
might
have
been
an
original
plan
from
which
while
the
general
arrangement
is
kept
every
separate
stroke
perversely
diverged
but
another
and
not
a
secondary
curiosity
of
this
is
that
it
is
the
habitat
of
a
multitude
of
marine
creatures
not
to
be
seen
at
home
in
many
other
places
except
twice
a
month
at
the
neaptides
the
lower
chambers
are
filled
with
the
sea
and
here
live
and
flourish
thousands
upon
thousands
of
those
mollusks
and
zoophytes
which
can
exist
only
in
its
salt
waters
the
sides
of
the
caves
as
far
as
the
highest
tides
swept
were
studded
with
crimson
and
purple
and
amber
mollusca
glistening
like
jewels
in
the
light
pouring
down
upon
them
from
the
overhead
not
the
space
of
a
was
clear
above
them
in
the
clefts
of
the
rock
hung
fringes
of
delicate
ferns
of
the
most
vivid
green
while
here
and
there
were
nooks
and
crevices
of
profound
darkness
black
with
perpetual
unbroken
shadow
i
had
known
the
caves
well
when
i
was
a
boy
but
it
was
many
years
since
i
had
been
there
now
i
was
alone
in
them
with
olivia
no
other
human
being
in
sight
or
sound
of
us
i
had
scarcely
eyes
for
any
sight
but
that
of
her
face
which
had
grown
shy
and
downcast
and
was
generally
turned
away
from
me
she
would
be
frightened
i
thought
if
i
spoke
to
her
in
that
lonesome
place
i
would
wait
till
we
were
on
the
cliffs
in
the
open
eye
of
day
she
left
my
side
for
one
moment
while
i
was
poking
under
a
stone
for
a
young
pieuvre
which
had
darkened
the
little
pool
of
water
round
it
with
its
inky
fluid
i
heard
her
utter
an
exclamation
of
delight
and
i
gave
up
my
pursuit
instantly
to
learn
what
was
giving
her
pleasure
she
was
stooping
down
to
look
beneath
a
low
arch
not
more
than
two
feet
high
and
i
knelt
down
beside
her
beyond
lay
a
straight
narrow
channel
of
transparent
water
blue
from
a
faint
reflected
light
with
smooth
sculptured
walls
of
rock
clear
from
mollusca
rising
on
each
side
of
it
level
lines
of
mimic
waves
rippled
monotonously
upon
it
as
if
it
was
stirred
by
some
soft
wind
which
we
could
not
feel
you
could
have
peopled
it
with
tiny
boats
flitting
across
it
or
skimming
lightly
down
it
tears
shone
in
olivia
eyes
it
reminds
me
so
of
a
canal
in
venice
she
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
do
you
know
venice
i
asked
and
the
recollection
of
her
portrait
taken
in
florence
came
to
my
mind
well
i
should
have
a
right
to
hear
about
all
her
wanderings
oh
yes
she
answered
i
spent
three
months
there
once
and
this
place
is
like
it
was
it
a
happy
time
i
inquired
jealous
of
those
tears
it
was
a
hateful
time
she
said
vehemently
do
let
us
talk
of
it
i
hate
to
remember
it
why
can
not
we
forget
things
martin
you
who
are
so
clever
can
tell
me
that
that
is
simple
enough
i
said
smiling
every
circumstance
of
our
life
makes
a
change
in
the
substance
of
the
brain
and
while
that
remains
sound
and
in
vigor
we
can
not
forget
is
being
written
on
our
brain
now
you
will
have
to
remember
this
olivia
i
know
i
shall
remember
it
she
answered
in
a
low
tone
you
have
travelled
a
great
deal
then
i
pursued
wishing
her
to
talk
about
herself
for
i
could
scarcely
trust
my
resolution
to
wait
till
we
were
out
of
the
caves
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
was
on
my
tongue
end
we
travelled
nearly
all
over
europe
she
replied
i
wondered
whom
she
meant
by
we
she
had
never
used
the
plural
pronoun
before
and
i
thought
of
that
odious
woman
in
guernsey
an
unpleasant
recollection
we
had
wandered
back
to
the
opening
where
tardif
had
left
us
the
rapid
current
between
us
and
breckhou
was
running
in
swift
eddies
which
showed
the
more
plainly
because
the
day
was
calm
and
the
open
sea
smooth
olivia
stood
near
me
but
a
sort
of
chilly
diffidence
had
crept
over
me
and
i
could
not
have
ventured
to
press
too
closely
to
her
or
to
touch
her
with
my
hand
how
have
you
been
content
to
live
here
i
asked
this
year
in
sark
has
saved
me
she
answered
softly
what
has
it
saved
you
from
i
inquired
with
intense
eagerness
she
turned
her
face
full
upon
me
with
a
world
of
reproach
in
her
gray
eyes
martin
she
said
why
will
you
persist
in
asking
me
about
my
former
life
tardif
never
does
he
never
implies
by
a
word
or
look
that
he
wishes
to
know
more
than
i
choose
to
tell
i
can
not
tell
you
any
thing
about
it
i
felt
uncomfortably
that
she
was
drawing
a
comparison
unfavorable
to
me
between
tardif
and
myself
the
gentleman
who
could
not
conquer
or
conceal
his
desire
to
fathom
a
mystery
and
the
fisherman
who
acted
as
if
there
were
no
mystery
at
all
yet
olivia
appeared
more
grieved
than
offended
and
when
she
knew
how
i
loved
her
she
would
admit
that
my
curiosity
was
natural
she
should
know
too
that
i
was
willing
to
take
her
as
she
was
with
all
the
secrets
of
her
former
life
kept
from
me
some
day
i
would
make
her
own
i
was
as
generous
as
tardif
just
then
my
ear
caught
for
the
first
time
a
low
which
had
probably
been
sounding
through
the
caves
for
some
minutes
good
heavens
i
ejaculated
yet
a
moment
thought
convinced
me
that
though
there
might
be
a
little
risk
there
was
no
paralyzing
danger
i
had
forgotten
the
narrowness
of
the
gully
through
which
alone
we
could
gain
the
cliffs
from
the
open
span
of
beach
where
we
were
now
standing
there
was
no
chance
of
leaving
the
caves
except
as
we
had
come
to
them
by
a
boat
for
on
each
side
a
crag
ran
like
a
spur
into
the
water
the
comparatively
open
space
permitted
the
tide
to
lap
in
quietly
and
steal
imperceptibly
higher
upon
its
pebbles
but
the
low
boom
i
heard
was
the
sea
rushing
in
through
the
throat
of
the
narrow
outlet
through
which
lay
our
only
means
of
escape
there
was
not
a
moment
to
lose
without
a
word
i
snatched
up
olivia
in
my
arms
and
ran
back
into
the
caves
making
as
rapidly
as
i
could
for
the
long
straight
passage
neither
did
olivia
speak
a
word
or
utter
a
cry
we
found
ourselves
in
a
low
tunnel
where
the
water
was
beginning
to
flow
in
pretty
strongly
i
set
her
down
for
an
instant
and
tore
off
my
coat
and
waistcoat
then
i
caught
her
up
again
and
strode
along
over
the
slippery
slimy
masses
of
rock
which
lay
under
my
feet
covered
with
seaweed
olivia
i
said
i
must
have
my
right
hand
free
to
steady
myself
with
put
both
your
arms
round
my
neck
and
cling
to
me
so
do
touch
my
arms
or
shoulders
yet
the
clinging
of
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
her
cheek
close
to
mine
almost
unnerved
me
i
held
her
fast
with
my
left
arm
and
steadied
myself
with
my
right
we
gained
in
a
minute
or
two
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
the
drift
was
pouring
into
it
with
a
force
almost
too
great
for
me
burdened
as
i
was
but
there
was
the
pause
of
the
tide
when
the
waves
rushed
out
again
in
white
floods
leaving
the
water
comparatively
shallow
there
were
still
six
or
eight
yards
to
traverse
before
we
could
reach
an
archway
in
the
cliffs
which
would
land
us
in
safety
in
the
outer
caves
across
this
small
space
the
tide
came
in
strongly
beating
against
the
foot
of
the
rocks
and
rebounding
with
great
force
there
was
some
peril
but
we
had
no
alternative
i
lifted
olivia
a
little
higher
against
my
shoulder
for
her
long
serge
dress
wrapped
dangerously
around
us
both
and
then
waiting
for
the
pause
in
the
throbbing
of
the
tide
i
dashed
hastily
across
one
swirl
of
the
water
coiled
about
us
washing
up
nearly
to
my
throat
and
giving
me
almost
a
choking
sensation
of
dread
but
before
a
second
could
swoop
down
upon
us
i
had
staggered
to
the
arch
and
put
down
olivia
in
the
small
secure
cave
within
it
she
had
not
spoken
once
she
did
not
seem
able
to
speak
now
her
large
terrified
eyes
looked
up
at
me
dumbly
and
her
face
was
white
to
the
lips
i
clasped
her
in
my
arms
once
more
and
kissed
her
forehead
and
lips
again
and
again
in
a
paroxysm
of
passionate
love
and
gladness
thank
god
i
cried
how
i
love
you
olivia
i
had
told
her
only
a
few
minutes
before
that
the
brain
is
ineffaceably
stamped
with
the
impress
of
every
event
in
our
lives
but
how
much
more
deeply
do
some
events
burn
themselves
there
than
others
i
see
it
all
now
more
clearly
it
seems
to
me
than
my
eyes
saw
it
then
there
is
the
huge
high
entrance
to
the
outer
caves
where
we
are
standing
with
a
massive
lintel
of
rocks
overhead
all
black
but
for
a
few
purple
and
gray
tints
scattered
across
the
blackness
behind
us
the
sea
is
glistening
and
prismatic
colors
play
upon
the
cliffs
shadows
fall
from
rocks
we
can
not
see
olivia
stands
before
me
pale
and
terrified
the
water
running
from
her
heavy
dress
which
clings
about
her
slender
figure
she
shrinks
away
from
me
a
pace
or
two
hush
she
cries
in
a
tone
of
mingled
pain
and
dread
hush
there
was
something
so
positive
so
prohibitory
in
her
voice
and
gesture
that
my
heart
contracted
and
a
sudden
chill
of
despondency
ran
through
me
but
i
could
not
be
silent
now
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
hold
my
peace
even
at
her
bidding
why
do
you
say
hush
i
asked
peremptorily
i
love
you
olivia
is
there
any
reason
why
i
should
not
love
you
yes
she
said
very
slowly
and
with
quivering
lips
i
was
married
four
years
ago
and
my
husband
is
living
still
chapter
the
thirtieth
a
gloomy
ending
olivia
answer
struck
me
like
an
electric
shock
for
some
moments
i
was
simply
stunned
and
knew
neither
what
she
had
said
nor
where
we
were
i
suppose
half
a
minute
had
elapsed
before
i
fairly
received
the
meaning
of
her
words
into
my
bewildered
brain
it
seemed
as
if
they
were
thundering
in
my
ears
though
she
had
uttered
them
in
a
low
frightened
voice
i
scarcely
understood
them
when
i
looked
up
and
saw
her
leaning
against
the
rock
with
her
hands
covering
her
face
olivia
i
cried
stretching
out
my
arms
toward
her
as
though
she
would
flutter
back
to
them
and
lay
her
head
again
where
it
had
been
resting
upon
my
shoulder
with
her
face
against
my
neck
but
she
did
not
see
my
gesture
and
the
next
moment
i
knew
that
she
could
never
let
me
hold
her
in
my
arms
again
i
dared
not
even
take
one
step
nearer
to
her
olivia
i
said
again
after
another
minute
or
two
of
troubled
silence
with
no
sound
but
the
thunders
of
the
sea
reverberating
through
the
perilous
strait
where
we
had
almost
confronted
death
together

is
it
true
she
bowed
her
head
still
lower
upon
her
hands
in
speechless
confirmation
a
stricken
helpless
cowering
child
she
seemed
to
me
standing
there
in
her
drenched
clothing
an
unutterable
tenderness
altogether
different
from
the
feverish
passion
of
a
few
minutes
ago
filled
my
heart
as
i
looked
at
her
come
i
said
as
calmly
as
i
could
speak
i
am
at
any
rate
your
doctor
and
i
am
bound
to
take
care
of
you
you
must
not
stay
here
wet
and
cold
let
us
make
haste
back
to
tardif
olivia
i
drew
her
hand
down
from
her
face
and
through
my
arm
for
we
had
still
to
the
outer
cave
and
to
return
through
a
higher
gallery
before
we
could
reach
the
cliffs
above
i
did
not
glance
at
her
the
road
was
very
rough
strewed
with
huge
bowlders
and
she
was
compelled
to
receive
my
help
but
we
did
not
speak
again
till
we
were
on
the
cliffs
in
the
eye
of
day
with
our
faces
and
our
steps
turned
toward
tardif
farm
oh
she
cried
suddenly
in
a
tone
that
made
my
heart
ache
the
keener
how
sorry
i
am
sorry
that
i
love
you
i
asked
feeling
that
my
love
was
growing
every
moment
in
spite
of
myself
the
sun
shone
on
her
face
which
was
just
below
my
eyes
there
was
an
expression
of
sad
perplexity
and
questioning
upon
it
which
kept
away
every
other
sign
of
emotion
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
me
frankly
and
no
flush
of
color
came
over
her
pale
cheeks
yes
she
answered
it
is
such
a
miserable
unfortunate
thing
for
you
but
how
could
i
have
helped
it
you
could
not
help
it
i
said
i
did
not
mean
to
deceive
you
she
continued
neither
you
nor
any
one
when
i
fled
away
from
him
i
had
no
plan
of
any
kind
i
was
just
like
a
leaf
driven
about
by
the
wind
and
it
tossed
me
here
i
did
not
think
i
ought
to
tell
any
one
i
was
married
i
wish
i
could
have
foreseen
this
why
did
god
let
me
have
that
accident
in
the
spring
why
did
he
let
you
come
over
to
see
me
are
you
surprised
that
i
love
you
i
asked
now
i
saw
a
subtle
flush
steal
across
her
face
and
her
eyes
fell
to
the
ground
i
never
thought
of
it
till
this
afternoon
she
murmured
i
knew
you
were
going
to
marry
your
cousin
julia
and
i
knew
i
was
married
and
that
there
could
be
no
release
from
that
all
my
life
is
ruined
but
you
and
tardif
made
it
more
bearable
i
did
not
think
you
loved
me
till
i
saw
your
face
this
afternoon
i
shall
always
love
you
i
cried
passionately
looking
down
on
the
shining
drooping
head
beside
me
and
the
sad
face
and
listless
arms
hanging
down
in
an
attitude
of
dejection
she
seemed
so
forlorn
a
creature
that
i
wished
i
could
take
her
to
my
heart
again
but
that
was
impossible
now
no
she
answered
in
her
calm
sorrowful
voice
when
you
see
clearly
that
it
is
an
evil
thing
you
will
conquer
it
there
will
be
no
hope
whatever
in
your
love
for
me
and
it
will
pass
away
not
soon
perhaps
i
can
scarcely
wish
you
to
forget
me
soon
yet
it
would
be
wrong
for
you
to
love
me
now
why
was
i
driven
to
marry
him
so
long
ago
a
sharp
bitter
tone
rang
through
her
quiet
voice
and
for
a
moment
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
olivia
i
said
it
is
harder
upon
me
than
you
can
think
or
i
can
tell
she
had
not
the
faintest
notion
of
how
hard
this
trial
was
i
had
sacrificed
every
plan
and
purpose
of
my
life
in
the
hope
of
winning
her
i
had
cast
away
almost
as
a
worthless
thing
the
substantial
prosperity
which
had
been
within
my
grasp
and
now
that
i
stretched
out
my
hand
for
the
prize
i
found
it
nothing
but
an
empty
shadow
deeper
even
than
this
lay
the
thought
of
my
mother
bitter
disappointment
your
husband
must
have
treated
you
very
badly
before
you
would
take
such
a
desperate
step
as
this
i
said
again
after
a
long
silence
scarcely
knowing
what
i
said
he
treated
me
so
ill
said
olivia
with
the
same
hard
tone
in
her
voice
that
when
i
had
a
chance
of
escape
it
seemed
as
if
god
himself
opened
the
door
for
me
he
treated
me
so
ill
that
if
i
thought
there
was
any
fear
of
him
finding
me
out
here
i
would
rather
a
thousand
times
you
had
left
me
to
die
in
the
caves
that
brought
to
my
mind
what
i
had
almost
forgotten
the
woman
whom
my
imprudent
curiosity
had
brought
into
pursuit
of
her
i
felt
ready
to
curse
my
folly
aloud
as
i
did
in
my
heart
for
having
gone
to
scott
and
brown
olivia
i
said
there
is
a
woman
in
guernsey
who
has
some
clew
to
you
but
i
could
say
no
more
for
i
thought
she
would
have
fallen
to
the
ground
in
her
terror
i
drew
her
hand
through
my
arm
and
hastened
to
reassure
her
no
harm
can
come
to
you
i
continued
while
tardif
and
i
are
here
to
protect
you
do
not
frighten
yourself
we
will
defend
you
from
every
danger
martin
she
whispered
and
the
pleasant
familiarity
of
my
name
spoken
by
her
gave
me
a
sharp
pang
almost
of
gladness
no
one
can
help
me
or
defend
me
the
law
would
compel
me
to
go
back
to
him
a
woman
heart
may
be
broken
without
the
law
being
broken
i
could
prove
nothing
that
would
give
me
a
right
to
be
free
nothing
so
i
took
it
into
my
own
hands
i
tell
you
i
would
rather
have
been
drowned
this
afternoon
why
did
you
save
me
i
did
not
answer
except
by
pressing
her
hand
against
my
side
i
hurried
her
on
silently
toward
the
cottage
she
was
shivering
in
her
cold
wet
dress
and
trembling
with
fear
it
was
plain
to
me
that
even
her
fine
health
should
not
be
trifled
with
and
i
loved
her
too
tenderly
her
poor
shivering
trembling
frame
to
let
her
suffer
if
i
could
help
it
when
we
reached
the
gate
i
stopped
her
for
a
moment
to
speak
only
a
few
words
go
in
i
said
and
change
every
one
of
your
wet
clothes
i
will
see
you
again
once
again
when
we
can
talk
with
one
another
calmly
god
bless
and
take
care
of
you
my
darling
she
smiled
faintly
and
laid
her
hand
in
mine
you
forgive
me
she
said
forgive
you
i
repeated
kissing
the
small
brown
hand
lingeringly
i
have
nothing
to
forgive
she
went
on
across
the
little
fold
and
into
the
house
without
looking
back
toward
me
i
could
see
her
pass
through
the
kitchen
into
her
own
room
where
i
had
watched
her
through
the
struggle
between
life
and
death
which
had
first
made
her
dear
to
me
then
i
made
my
way
blind
and
deaf
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
seeing
nothing
i
flung
myself
down
on
the
turf
with
my
face
to
the
ground
to
hide
my
eyes
from
the
staring
light
of
the
summer
sun
already
it
seemed
a
long
time
since
i
had
known
that
olivia
was
married
the
knowledge
had
lost
its
freshness
and
novelty
and
the
sting
of
it
had
become
a
rooted
sorrow
there
was
no
mystery
about
her
now
i
almost
laughed
with
a
resentful
bitterness
at
the
poor
guesses
i
had
made
this
was
the
solution
and
it
placed
her
forever
out
of
my
reach
as
with
tardif
so
she
could
be
nothing
for
me
now
but
as
the
blue
sky
and
the
white
clouds
and
the
stars
shining
in
the
night
my
poor
olivia
whom
i
loved
a
hundredfold
more
than
i
had
done
even
this
morning
this
morning
i
had
been
full
of
my
own
triumph
and
gladness
now
i
had
nothing
in
my
heart
but
a
vast
pity
and
reverential
tenderness
for
her
married
that
was
what
she
had
said
it
shut
out
all
hope
for
the
future
she
must
have
been
a
mere
child
four
years
ago
she
looked
very
young
and
girlish
still
and
her
husband
treated
her
ill
my
olivia
for
whom
i
had
given
up
all
i
had
to
give
she
said
the
law
would
compel
her
to
return
to
him
and
i
could
do
nothing
i
could
not
interfere
even
to
save
her
from
a
life
which
was
worse
to
her
than
death
my
heart
was
caught
in
a
vice
and
there
was
no
escape
from
the
torture
of
its
relentless
grip
whichever
way
i
looked
there
was
sorrow
and
despair
i
wished
with
a
i
had
never
felt
before
that
olivia
and
i
had
indeed
perished
together
down
in
the
caves
where
the
tide
was
now
sweeping
below
me
martin
said
a
clear
low
tender
tone
in
my
ear
which
could
never
be
deaf
to
that
voice
i
looked
up
at
olivia
without
moving
my
head
was
at
her
feet
and
i
laid
my
hand
upon
the
hem
of
her
dress
martin
she
said
again
see
i
have
brought
you
tardifs
coat
in
place
of
your
own
you
must
not
lie
here
in
this
way
captain
carey
yacht
is
waiting
for
you
below
i
staggered
giddily
when
i
stood
on
my
feet
and
only
olivia
look
of
pain
steadied
me
she
had
been
weeping
bitterly
i
could
not
trust
myself
to
look
in
her
face
again
at
any
rate
my
next
duty
was
to
go
away
without
adding
to
her
distress
if
that
were
possible
tardif
was
standing
behind
her
regarding
us
both
with
great
concern
doctor
he
said
when
i
came
in
from
my
the
captain
sent
a
message
by
me
to
say
the
sun
would
be
gone
down
before
you
reach
guernsey
he
has
come
round
to
the
havre
gosselin
i
walk
down
the
cliff
with
you
i
should
have
said
no
but
olivia
caught
at
his
words
eagerly
yes
go
my
good
tardif
she
cried
and
bring
me
word
that
martin
is
safe
on
her
hand
in
mine
again
for
a
moment
with
its
slight
pressure
then
she
was
gone
tardif
was
tramping
down
the
stony
path
before
me
speaking
to
me
over
his
shoulder
it
has
not
gone
well
then
doctor
he
said
she
will
tell
you
i
answered
briefly
not
knowing
how
much
olivia
might
wish
him
to
know
take
care
of
i
said
when
we
had
reached
the
top
of
the
ladder
and
the
little
boat
from
the
yacht
was
dancing
at
the
foot
of
it
there
is
some
danger
ahead
and
you
can
protect
her
better
than
i
yes
yes
he
replied
you
may
trust
her
with
me
but
god
knows
i
should
have
been
glad
if
it
had
gone
well
with
you
chapter
the
a
story
in
detail
well
said
captain
carey
as
i
set
my
foot
on
the
deck
his
face
was
all
excitement
and
he
put
his
arm
affectionately
through
mine
it
is
all
wrong
i
answered
gloomily
you
do
mean
that
she
will
not
have
you
he
exclaimed
i
nodded
for
i
had
no
spirit
to
explain
the
matter
just
then
by
george
he
cried
and
you
thrown
over
julia
and
offended
all
our
guernsey
folks
and
half
broken
your
poor
mother
heart
all
for
nothing
the
last
consideration
was
the
one
that
stung
me
to
the
quick
it
half
broken
my
mother
heart
no
one
knew
better
than
i
that
it
had
without
doubt
tended
to
shorten
her
fleeting
term
of
life
at
this
moment
she
was
waiting
for
me
to
bring
her
good
news
perhaps
the
promise
that
olivia
had
consented
to
become
my
wife
before
her
own
last
hour
arrived
for
my
mother
and
i
had
even
talked
of
that
i
had
thought
it
a
romantic
scheme
when
my
mother
spoke
of
it
but
my
passion
had
fastened
eagerly
upon
it
in
spite
of
my
better
judgment
these
were
the
tidings
she
was
waiting
to
hear
from
my
lips
when
i
reached
home
i
found
her
full
of
dangerous
excitement
it
was
impossible
to
allay
it
without
telling
her
either
an
untruth
or
the
whole
story
i
could
not
deceive
her
and
with
a
desperate
calmness
i
related
the
history
of
the
day
i
tried
to
make
light
of
my
disappointment
but
she
broke
down
into
tears
and
wailings
oh
my
boy
she
lamented
and
i
did
so
want
to
see
you
happy
before
i
died
i
wanted
to
leave
some
one
who
could
comfort
you
and
olivia
would
have
comforted
you
and
loved
you
when
i
am
gone
you
had
set
your
heart
upon
her
are
you
sure
it
is
true
my
poor
poor
martin
you
must
forget
her
now
it
becomes
a
sin
for
you
to
love
her
i
can
not
forget
her
i
said
i
can
not
cease
to
love
her
there
can
be
no
sin
in
it
as
long
as
i
think
of
her
as
i
do
now
and
there
is
poor
julia
moaned
my
mother
yes
there
was
julia
and
she
would
have
to
be
told
all
though
she
would
rejoice
over
it
of
course
she
would
rejoice
it
was
not
in
human
nature
at
least
in
julia
human
nature
to
do
otherwise
she
had
warned
me
against
olivia
had
only
set
me
free
reluctantly
but
how
was
i
to
tell
her
i
must
not
leave
to
my
mother
the
agitation
of
imparting
such
tidings
i
could
think
of
deputing
the
task
to
my
father
there
was
no
one
to
do
it
but
myself
my
mother
passed
a
restless
and
agitated
night
and
i
who
sat
up
with
her
was
compelled
to
listen
to
all
her
lamentation
but
toward
the
morning
she
fell
into
a
heavy
sleep
likely
to
last
for
some
hours
i
could
leave
her
in
perfect
security
and
at
an
early
hour
i
went
down
to
julia
house
strung
up
to
bear
the
worst
and
intending
to
have
it
all
out
with
her
and
put
her
on
her
guard
before
she
paid
her
daily
visit
to
our
house
she
must
have
some
hours
for
her
excitement
and
rejoicing
to
bubble
over
before
she
came
to
talk
about
it
to
my
mother
i
wish
to
see
miss
dobrée
i
said
to
the
girl
who
quickly
answered
my
noisy
peal
of
the
please
sir
was
her
reply
she
and
miss
daltrey
are
gone
to
sark
with
captain
carey
gone
to
sark
i
repeated
in
utter
amazement
yes
martin
they
started
quite
early
because
of
the
tide
and
captain
carey
man
brought
the
carriage
to
take
them
to
sampson
i
do
look
for
them
back
before
evening
miss
dobrée
said
i
was
to
come
with
her
love
and
ask
how
dobrée
is
and
if
home
in
time
she
come
this
evening
but
if
she
late
she
come
morning
when
did
they
make
up
their
minds
to
go
to
sark
i
inquired
anxiously
only
late
last
night
sir
she
answered
cook
had
settled
with
miss
dobrée
to
dine
early
but
then
captain
carey
came
in
and
after
he
was
gone
she
said
breakfast
must
be
ready
at
seven
this
morning
in
their
own
rooms
while
they
were
dressing
so
they
must
have
settled
it
with
captain
carey
last
night
i
turned
away
very
much
surprised
and
bewildered
and
in
an
irritable
state
which
made
the
least
thing
jar
upon
me
curiosity
which
had
slept
yesterday
or
was
numbed
by
the
shock
of
my
disappointment
was
feverishly
awake
how
little
i
knew
after
all
of
the
mystery
which
surrounded
olivia
the
bitter
core
of
it
i
knew
but
nothing
of
the
many
sheaths
and
envelops
which
wrapped
it
about
there
might
be
some
hope
some
consolation
to
be
found
wrapped
up
with
it
i
must
go
again
to
sark
in
the
steamer
on
monday
and
hear
olivia
tell
me
all
she
could
tell
of
her
history
then
why
were
julia
and
kate
daltrey
gone
to
sark
what
could
they
have
to
do
with
olivia
it
made
me
almost
wild
with
anger
to
think
of
them
finding
olivia
and
talking
to
her
perhaps
of
me
and
my
love
questioning
her
arguing
with
her
tormenting
her
the
bare
thought
of
those
two
badgering
my
olivia
was
enough
to
drive
me
frantic
in
the
cool
twilight
julia
and
kate
daltrey
were
announced
i
was
about
to
withdraw
from
my
mother
room
in
conformity
with
the
etiquette
established
among
us
when
julia
recalled
me
in
a
gentler
voice
than
she
had
used
toward
me
since
the
day
of
my
fatal
confession
stay
martin
she
said
what
we
have
to
tell
concerns
you
more
than
any
one
i
sat
down
again
by
my
mother
sofa
and
she
took
my
hand
between
both
her
own
fondling
it
in
the
dusk
it
is
about
olivia
i
said
in
as
cool
a
tone
as
i
could
command
yes
answered
julia
we
have
seen
her
and
we
have
found
out
why
she
has
refused
you
she
is
married
already
she
told
me
so
yesterday
i
replied
told
you
so
yesterday
repeated
julia
in
an
accent
of
chagrin
if
we
had
only
known
that
we
might
have
saved
ourselves
the
passage
across
to
sark
my
dear
julia
exclaimed
my
mother
feverishly
do
tell
us
all
about
it
and
begin
at
the
beginning
there
was
nothing
julia
liked
so
much
or
could
do
so
well
as
to
give
a
circumstantial
account
of
any
thing
she
had
done
she
could
relate
minute
details
with
so
much
accuracy
without
being
exactly
tedious
that
when
one
was
lazy
or
unoccupied
it
was
pleasant
to
listen
my
mother
enjoyed
with
all
the
delight
of
a
woman
the
small
touches
by
which
julia
embellished
her
sketches
i
resigned
myself
to
hearing
a
long
history
when
i
was
burning
to
ask
one
or
two
questions
and
have
done
with
the
topic
to
begin
at
the
beginning
then
said
julia
dear
captain
carey
came
into
town
very
late
last
night
to
talk
to
us
about
martin
and
how
the
girl
in
sark
had
refused
him
i
was
very
much
astonished
very
much
indeed
captain
carey
said
that
he
and
dear
johanna
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
girl
felt
some
delicacy
perhaps
because
of
martin
engagement
to
me
we
talked
it
over
as
friends
and
thought
of
you
dear
aunt
and
your
grief
and
disappointment
till
all
at
once
i
made
up
my
mind
in
a
moment
will
go
over
to
sark
and
see
the
girl
myself
i
said
you
said
captain
carey
no
julia
it
will
be
too
much
for
you
would
have
been
a
few
weeks
ago
i
said
now
i
could
do
any
thing
to
give
aunt
dobrée
a
moment
happiness
god
bless
you
julia
i
interrupted
going
across
to
her
and
kissing
her
cheek
impetuously
there
do
stop
me
martin
she
said
earnestly
so
it
was
arranged
that
captain
carey
should
send
for
us
at
sampson
this
morning
and
take
us
over
to
sark
you
know
kate
has
never
been
yet
we
had
a
splendid
passage
and
landed
at
the
creux
where
the
yacht
was
to
wait
till
we
returned
kate
was
in
raptures
with
the
and
the
lovely
lane
leading
up
into
the
island
we
went
on
past
vaudin
inn
and
the
mill
and
turned
down
the
nearest
way
to
tardifs
kate
said
she
never
felt
any
air
like
the
air
of
sark
well
you
know
that
brown
pool
a
very
brown
pool
in
the
lane
leading
to
the
havre
gosselin
just
there
where
there
are
some
low
trees
meeting
overhead
and
making
a
long
green
isle
with
the
sun
shining
down
through
the
knotted
branches
we
saw
all
in
a
moment
a
slim
erect
very
girl
coming
toward
us
she
was
carrying
her
bonnet
in
her
hand
and
her
hair
curled
in
short
bright
curls
all
over
her
head
i
knew
in
an
instant
that
it
was
miss
ollivier
she
paused
for
a
minute
how
plainly
i
could
see
the
picture
the
arching
trees
and
the
sunbeams
playing
fondly
with
her
shining
golden
hair
i
held
my
breath
to
listen
what
completely
startled
me
said
julia
was
that
kate
suddenly
darted
forward
and
ran
to
meet
her
crying
how
does
she
know
her
i
exclaimed
hush
martin
do
interrupt
me
the
girl
went
so
deadly
pale
i
thought
she
was
going
to
faint
but
she
did
not
she
stood
for
a
minute
looking
at
us
and
then
she
burst
into
the
most
dreadful
fit
of
crying
i
ran
to
her
and
made
her
sit
down
on
a
little
bank
of
turf
close
by
and
gave
her
my
and
did
all
i
could
to
comfort
her
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
she
said
to
kate
did
you
find
me
out
and
kate
told
her
she
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
finding
her
there
martin
dobrée
of
guernsey
told
me
you
were
looking
for
me
only
yesterday
she
said
that
took
us
by
surprise
for
kate
had
not
the
faintest
idea
of
seeing
her
i
have
always
thought
her
name
was
ollivier
and
so
did
kate
pity
sake
said
the
girl
you
have
any
pity
leave
me
here
in
peace
for
god
sake
do
not
betray
me
i
could
hardly
believe
it
was
not
a
dream
there
was
kate
standing
over
us
looking
very
stern
and
severe
and
the
girl
was
clinging
to
me
to
as
if
i
were
her
dearest
friend
then
all
of
a
sudden
up
came
old
mother
renouf
looking
half
crazed
and
began
to
harangue
us
for
frightening
tardif
she
said
would
be
at
hand
in
a
minute
or
two
and
he
would
take
care
of
her
from
us
and
everybody
else
me
away
cried
the
girl
running
to
her
and
the
old
woman
tucked
her
hand
under
her
arm
and
walked
off
with
her
in
triumph
leaving
us
by
ourselves
in
the
lane
but
what
does
it
all
mean
asked
my
mother
while
i
paced
to
and
fro
in
the
dim
room
scarcely
able
to
control
my
impatience
yet
afraid
to
question
julia
too
eagerly
i
can
tell
you
said
kate
daltrey
in
her
cold
deliberate
tones
she
is
the
wife
of
my
richard
foster
who
married
her
more
than
four
years
ago
in
melbourne
and
she
ran
away
from
him
last
october
and
has
not
been
heard
of
since
then
you
know
her
whole
history
i
said
approaching
her
and
pausing
before
her
are
you
at
liberty
to
tell
it
to
us
certainly
she
answered
it
is
no
secret
her
father
was
a
wealthy
colonist
and
he
died
when
she
was
fifteen
leaving
her
in
the
charge
of
her
richard
foster
aunt
the
match
was
one
of
the
stepmother
making
for
olivia
was
little
better
than
a
child
richard
was
glad
enough
to
get
her
fortune
or
rather
the
income
from
it
for
of
course
she
did
not
come
into
full
possession
of
it
till
she
was
of
age
of
it
was
settled
upon
her
absolutely
the
other
came
to
her
for
her
to
do
what
she
pleased
with
it
richard
was
looking
forward
eagerly
to
her
being
for
he
had
made
ducks
and
drakes
of
his
own
property
and
tried
to
do
the
same
with
mine
he
would
have
done
so
with
his
wife
but
a
few
weeks
before
birthday
she
disappeared
mysteriously
there
her
fortune
lies
and
richard
has
no
more
power
than
i
have
to
touch
it
he
can
not
even
claim
the
money
lying
in
the
bank
of
australia
which
has
been
remitted
by
her
trustees
nor
can
olivia
claim
it
without
making
herself
known
to
him
it
is
accumulating
there
while
both
of
them
are
on
the
verge
of
poverty
but
he
must
have
been
very
cruel
to
her
before
she
would
run
away
said
my
mother
in
a
very
pitiful
voice
poor
mother
she
had
borne
her
own
sorrows
dumbly
and
to
leave
her
husband
had
probably
never
occurred
to
her
cruel
repeated
kate
daltrey
well
there
are
many
kinds
of
cruelty
i
do
not
suppose
richard
would
ever
transgress
the
limits
of
the
law
but
olivia
was
one
of
those
girls
who
can
suffer
great
torture
mental
torture
i
mean
even
i
could
not
live
in
the
same
house
with
him
and
she
was
a
dreamy
sensitive
romantic
child
with
as
much
knowledge
of
the
world
as
a
baby
i
was
astonished
to
hear
she
had
had
daring
enough
to
leave
him
but
there
must
be
some
protection
for
her
from
the
law
i
said
thinking
of
the
bold
coarse
woman
no
doubt
his
associate
who
was
in
pursuit
of
olivia
she
might
sue
for
a
judicial
separation
at
the
least
if
not
a
divorce
i
am
quite
sure
nothing
could
be
brought
against
him
in
a
court
of
law
she
answered
he
is
very
wary
and
cunning
and
knows
very
well
what
he
may
do
and
what
he
may
not
do
a
few
months
before
flight
he
introduced
a
woman
as
her
companion
a
disreputable
woman
probably
but
he
calls
her
his
cousin
and
i
do
not
know
how
olivia
could
prove
her
an
unfit
person
to
be
with
her
our
suspicions
may
be
very
strong
but
suspicion
is
not
enough
for
an
english
judge
and
jury
since
i
saw
her
this
morning
i
have
been
thinking
of
her
position
in
every
light
and
i
really
do
not
see
any
thing
she
could
have
done
except
running
away
as
she
did
or
making
up
her
mind
to
be
deaf
and
blind
and
dumb
there
was
no
other
alternative
but
could
he
not
be
induced
to
leave
her
in
peace
if
she
gave
up
a
portion
of
her
property
i
asked
why
should
he
she
retorted
if
she
was
in
his
hands
the
whole
of
the
property
would
be
his
he
will
never
release
her
never
no
her
only
chance
is
to
hide
herself
from
him
the
law
can
not
deal
with
wrongs
like
hers
because
they
are
as
light
as
air
apparently
though
they
are
as
as
air
is
and
as
poisonous
as
air
can
be
they
are
like
only
not
quite
fatal
he
is
as
crafty
and
cunning
as
a
serpent
he
could
prove
himself
the
kindest
most
considerate
of
husbands
and
olivia
next
thing
to
an
idiot
oh
it
is
ridiculous
to
think
of
pitting
a
girl
like
her
against
him
if
she
had
been
older
or
if
she
had
had
a
child
she
would
never
have
left
him
said
my
mother
gentle
and
sorrowful
voice
but
what
can
be
done
for
her
i
asked
vehemently
and
passionately
my
poor
olivia
what
can
i
do
to
protect
her
nothing
answered
kate
daltrey
coldly
her
only
chance
is
concealment
and
what
a
poor
chance
that
is
i
went
over
to
sark
never
thinking
that
your
miss
ollivier
whom
i
had
heard
so
much
of
was
olivia
foster
it
is
an
place
but
so
much
the
more
readily
they
will
find
her
if
they
once
get
a
clew
a
fox
is
soon
caught
when
it
can
not
double
and
how
could
olivia
escape
if
they
only
traced
her
to
sark
my
dread
of
the
woman
into
whose
hands
my
imbecile
curiosity
had
put
the
clew
was
growing
greater
every
minute
it
seemed
as
if
olivia
could
not
be
safe
now
day
or
night
yet
what
protection
could
i
or
tardif
give
to
her
you
will
not
betray
her
i
said
to
kate
daltrey
though
feeling
all
the
time
that
i
could
not
trust
her
in
the
smallest
degree
i
have
promised
dear
julia
that
she
answered
i
should
fail
to
give
you
any
clear
idea
of
my
state
of
mind
should
i
attempt
to
analyze
it
the
most
bitter
thought
in
it
was
that
my
own
imprudence
had
betrayed
olivia
but
for
me
she
might
have
remained
for
years
in
peace
and
perfect
seclusion
in
the
home
to
which
she
had
drifted
richard
foster
and
his
accomplice
must
have
lost
all
hope
of
finding
her
during
the
many
months
that
had
elapsed
between
her
disappearance
and
my
visit
to
their
solicitors
that
had
put
them
on
the
track
again
if
the
law
forced
her
back
to
her
husband
it
was
i
who
had
helped
him
to
find
her
that
was
a
maddening
thought
my
love
for
her
was
hopeless
but
what
then
i
discovered
to
my
own
amazement
that
i
had
loved
her
for
her
sake
not
my
own
i
had
loved
the
woman
in
herself
not
the
woman
as
my
wife
she
could
never
become
that
but
she
was
dearer
to
me
than
ever
she
was
as
far
removed
from
me
as
from
tardif
could
i
not
serve
her
with
as
deep
a
devotion
and
as
true
a
chivalry
as
his
she
belonged
to
both
of
us
by
as
unselfish
and
noble
a
bond
as
ever
knights
of
old
were
pledged
to
it
became
my
duty
to
keep
a
strict
watch
over
the
woman
who
had
come
to
guernsey
to
find
olivia
if
possible
i
must
decoy
her
away
from
the
lowly
nest
where
my
helpless
bird
was
sheltered
she
had
not
sent
for
me
again
but
i
called
upon
her
the
next
morning
professionally
and
stayed
some
time
talking
with
her
but
nothing
resulted
from
the
visit
beyond
the
assurance
that
she
had
not
yet
made
any
progress
toward
the
discovery
of
my
secret
i
almost
marvelled
at
this
so
universal
had
been
the
gossip
about
my
visits
to
sark
in
connection
with
the
of
my
engagement
to
julia
but
that
had
occurred
in
the
spring
and
the
wonder
had
ceased
before
my
patient
came
to
the
island
still
any
accidental
conversation
might
give
her
the
information
and
open
up
a
favorable
chance
for
her
i
must
not
let
her
go
across
to
sark
unknown
to
myself
neither
did
i
feel
quite
safe
about
kate
daltrey
she
gave
me
the
impression
of
being
as
crafty
and
cunning
as
she
described
her
did
she
know
this
woman
by
sight
that
was
a
question
i
could
not
answer
there
was
another
question
hanging
upon
it
if
she
saw
her
would
she
not
in
some
way
contrive
to
give
her
a
sufficient
hint
without
positively
breaking
her
promise
to
julia
kate
daltrey
name
did
not
appear
in
the
newspapers
among
the
list
of
visitors
as
she
was
staying
in
a
private
house
but
she
and
this
woman
might
meet
any
day
in
the
streets
or
on
the
pier
then
the
whole
story
had
been
confided
by
julia
at
once
to
captain
carey
and
johanna
that
was
quite
natural
but
it
was
equally
natural
for
them
to
confide
it
again
to
some
one
or
two
of
their
intimate
friends
the
secret
was
already
an
open
one
among
six
persons
could
it
be
considered
a
secret
any
longer
the
tendency
of
such
a
singular
story
whispered
from
one
to
another
is
to
become
in
the
more
widely
circulated
than
if
it
were
openly
proclaimed
i
had
a
strong
affection
for
my
circle
of
cousins
which
widened
as
the
circle
round
a
stone
cast
into
water
but
i
knew
i
might
as
well
try
to
arrest
the
eddying
of
such
waters
as
stop
the
spread
of
a
story
like
olivia
i
had
resolved
in
the
first
access
of
my
curiosity
to
cross
over
to
sark
the
next
week
alone
and
independent
of
captain
carey
every
monday
the
queen
of
the
isles
made
her
accustomed
trip
to
the
island
to
convey
visitors
there
for
the
day
i
had
not
been
on
deck
two
minutes
the
following
monday
when
i
saw
my
patient
step
on
after
me
the
last
clew
was
in
her
fingers
now
that
was
evident
chapter
the
olivia
gone
she
did
not
see
me
at
first
but
her
air
was
exultant
and
satisfied
there
was
no
face
on
board
so
elated
and
flushed
i
kept
out
of
her
way
as
long
as
i
could
without
consigning
myself
to
the
black
hole
of
the
cabin
but
at
last
she
caught
sight
of
me
and
came
down
to
the
forecastle
to
claim
me
as
an
acquaintance
ha
ha
dr
dobrée
she
exclaimed
so
you
are
going
to
visit
sark
too
yes
i
answered
more
curtly
than
courteously
you
are
looking
rather
low
she
said
triumphantly
rather
blue
i
might
say
is
there
any
thing
the
matter
with
you
your
face
is
as
long
as
a
fiddle
perhaps
it
is
the
sea
that
makes
you
melancholy
not
at
all
i
answered
trying
to
speak
briskly
i
am
an
old
sailor
perhaps
you
will
feel
melancholy
luckily
for
me
my
prophecy
was
fulfilled
shortly
after
for
the
day
was
rough
enough
to
produce
uncomfortable
sensations
in
those
who
were
not
old
sailors
like
myself
my
tormentor
was
prostrate
to
the
last
moment
when
we
anchored
at
the
entrance
of
the
creux
and
the
small
boats
came
out
to
carry
us
ashore
i
managed
easily
to
secure
a
place
in
the
first
and
to
lose
sight
of
her
in
the
bustle
of
landing
as
soon
as
my
feet
touched
the
shore
i
started
off
at
my
swiftest
pace
for
the
havre
gosselin
but
i
had
not
far
to
go
for
at
vaudin
inn
which
stands
at
the
top
of
the
steep
lane
running
from
the
creux
harbor
i
saw
tardif
at
the
door
now
and
then
he
acted
as
guide
when
young
vaudin
could
not
fill
that
office
or
had
more
parties
than
he
could
manage
and
tardif
was
now
waiting
the
arrival
of
the
weekly
stream
of
tourists
he
came
to
me
instantly
and
we
sat
down
on
a
low
stone
wall
on
the
roadside
but
well
out
of
hearing
of
any
ears
but
each
other
tardif
i
said
has
told
you
her
secret
yes
yes
he
answered
poor
little
soul
and
she
is
a
hundredfold
dearer
to
me
now
than
before
he
looked
as
if
he
meant
it
for
his
eyes
moistened
and
his
face
quivered
she
is
in
great
danger
at
this
moment
i
continued
a
woman
sent
by
her
husband
has
been
lurking
about
in
guernsey
to
get
news
of
her
and
she
has
come
across
in
the
steamer
she
will
be
in
sight
of
us
in
a
few
minutes
there
is
no
chance
of
her
not
learning
where
she
is
living
but
could
we
not
hide
olivia
somewhere
there
are
caves
strangers
know
nothing
of
we
might
take
her
over
to
breckhou
be
quick
tardif
we
must
decide
at
once
what
to
do
but
is
not
here
she
is
gone
he
answered
gone
i
ejaculated
i
could
not
utter
another
word
but
i
stared
at
him
as
if
my
eyes
could
tear
further
information
from
him
yes
he
said
that
lady
came
last
week
with
miss
dobrée
your
cousin
then
told
me
all
and
we
took
counsel
together
it
was
not
safe
for
her
to
stay
any
longer
though
i
would
have
died
for
her
gladly
but
what
could
be
done
we
knew
she
must
go
elsewhere
and
the
next
morning
i
rowed
her
over
to
in
time
for
the
steamer
to
england
poor
little
thing
poor
little
hunted
soul
his
voice
faltered
as
he
spoke
and
he
drew
his
fisherman
cap
close
down
over
his
eyes
i
did
not
speak
again
for
a
minute
or
two
tardif
i
said
at
last
as
the
foremost
among
the
tourists
came
in
sight
did
she
leave
no
message
for
me
she
wrote
a
letter
for
you
he
said
the
very
last
thing
she
did
not
go
to
bed
that
night
neither
did
i
was
going
to
lose
her
doctor
and
she
had
been
like
the
light
of
the
sun
to
me
but
what
could
i
do
she
was
terrified
to
death
at
the
thought
of
her
husband
claiming
her
i
promised
to
give
the
letter
into
your
own
hands
but
we
settled
i
must
not
show
myself
in
the
day
she
left
here
it
is
it
had
been
lying
in
his
and
the
edges
were
worn
already
he
gave
it
to
me
lingeringly
as
if
loath
to
part
with
it
the
tourists
were
coming
up
in
greater
numbers
and
i
made
a
retreat
hastily
toward
a
quiet
and
remote
part
of
the
cliffs
seldom
visited
in
little
sark
there
with
the
sea
which
had
carried
her
away
from
me
playing
buoyantly
among
the
rocks
i
read
her
farewell
letter
it
ran
thus
my
dear
friend
i
am
glad
i
can
call
you
my
friend
though
nothing
can
ever
come
of
our
friendship
nothing
for
we
may
not
see
one
another
as
other
friends
do
my
life
was
ruined
four
years
ago
and
every
now
and
then
i
see
afresh
how
complete
and
terrible
the
ruin
is
yet
if
i
had
known
beforehand
how
your
life
would
be
linked
with
mine
i
would
have
done
any
thing
in
my
power
to
save
you
from
sharing
in
my
ruin
ought
i
to
have
told
you
at
once
that
i
was
married
but
just
that
was
my
secret
and
it
seemed
so
much
safer
while
no
one
knew
it
but
myself
i
did
not
see
as
i
do
now
that
i
was
acting
a
falsehood
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
help
doing
that
it
is
as
shocking
to
me
as
to
you
do
not
judge
me
harshly
i
do
not
like
to
speak
to
you
about
my
marriage
i
was
very
young
and
very
miserable
any
change
seemed
better
than
living
with
my
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
doing
the
saviour
said
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
i
hope
i
shall
be
forgiven
by
you
and
your
mother
and
god
for
indeed
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
doing
last
october
when
i
escaped
from
them
it
was
partly
because
i
felt
i
should
soon
be
as
wicked
as
they
i
do
not
think
any
one
ought
to
remain
where
there
is
no
chance
of
being
good
if
i
am
wrong
remember
i
am
not
old
yet
i
may
learn
what
my
duty
is
and
then
i
will
do
it
i
am
only
waiting
to
find
out
exactly
what
i
ought
to
do
and
then
i
will
do
it
whatever
it
may
be
now
i
am
compelled
to
flee
away
again
from
this
quiet
peaceful
home
where
you
and
tardif
have
been
so
good
to
me
i
began
to
feel
perfectly
safe
here
and
all
at
once
the
refuge
fails
me
it
breaks
my
heart
but
i
must
go
and
my
only
gladness
is
that
it
will
be
good
for
you
you
will
forget
me
and
return
to
your
cousin
julia
and
be
happy
just
as
you
once
thought
you
should
be
as
you
would
have
been
but
for
me
you
must
think
of
me
as
one
dead
i
am
quite
dead
lost
to
you
yet
i
know
you
will
sometimes
wish
to
hear
what
has
become
of
me
tardif
will
and
i
owe
you
both
more
than
i
can
ever
repay
but
it
would
not
be
well
for
me
to
write
often
i
have
promised
tardif
that
i
will
write
to
him
once
a
year
that
you
and
he
may
know
that
i
am
still
alive
when
there
comes
no
letter
say
is
dead
do
not
be
grieved
for
that
it
will
be
the
greatest
best
release
god
can
give
me
say
god
olivia
is
dead
my
dear
friend
olivia
the
last
line
was
written
in
a
shaken
irregular
hand
and
her
name
was
half
blotted
out
as
if
a
tear
had
fallen
upon
it
i
remained
there
alone
on
the
wild
and
solitary
cliffs
until
it
was
time
to
return
to
the
steamer
tardif
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
entrance
of
the
little
tunnel
through
which
the
road
passes
down
to
the
harbor
he
did
not
speak
at
first
but
he
drew
out
of
his
pocket
an
old
leather
pouch
filled
with
yellow
papers
among
them
lay
a
long
curling
tress
of
shining
hair
he
touched
it
gently
with
his
finger
as
if
it
had
feeling
and
consciousness
you
would
like
to
have
it
doctor
he
said
ay
i
answered
and
that
only
i
could
not
venture
upon
another
word
chapter
the
the
ebb
of
life
there
was
nothing
now
for
me
to
do
but
to
devote
myself
wholly
to
my
mother
i
made
the
malady
under
which
she
was
slowly
sinking
my
special
study
there
remained
a
spark
of
hope
yet
in
my
heart
that
i
might
by
diligent
intense
unflagging
search
discover
some
remedy
yet
untried
or
perhaps
unthought
of
i
succeeded
only
in
alleviating
her
sufferings
i
pored
over
every
work
which
treated
of
the
same
class
of
diseases
at
last
in
an
old
book
i
came
upon
a
simple
medicament
which
united
with
appliances
made
available
by
modern
science
gave
her
sensible
relief
and
without
doubt
tended
to
prolong
her
shortening
days
the
agonizing
thought
haunted
me
that
had
i
come
upon
this
discovery
at
an
earlier
stage
of
her
illness
her
life
might
have
been
spared
for
many
years
but
it
was
too
late
now
she
suffered
less
and
her
spirits
grew
calm
and
even
we
even
ventured
at
her
own
wish
to
spend
a
week
together
in
sark
she
and
i
a
week
never
to
be
forgotten
full
of
exquisite
pain
and
exquisite
enjoyment
to
us
both
we
revisited
almost
every
place
where
we
had
been
many
years
before
while
i
was
but
a
child
and
she
was
still
young
and
strong
tardif
rowed
us
out
in
his
boat
under
the
cliffs
then
we
came
home
again
and
she
sank
rapidly
as
if
the
flame
of
life
had
been
burning
too
quickly
in
the
breath
of
those
innocent
pleasures
now
she
began
to
be
troubled
again
with
the
dread
of
leaving
me
alone
and
comfortless
there
is
no
passage
in
christ
farewell
to
his
disciples
which
touches
me
so
much
as
those
words
i
will
not
leave
you
comfortless
i
will
come
unto
you
my
mother
could
not
promise
to
come
back
to
me
and
her
dying
vision
looked
sorrowfully
into
the
future
for
me
sometimes
she
put
her
fear
into
words
faltering
and
foreboding
words
but
it
was
always
in
her
eyes
as
they
followed
me
wherever
i
went
with
a
mute
pathetic
anxiety
no
assurances
of
mine
no
assumed
cheerfulness
and
fortitude
could
remove
it
i
even
tried
to
laugh
at
it
but
my
laugh
only
brought
the
tears
into
her
eyes
neither
reason
nor
ridicule
could
root
it
out
a
root
of
bitterness
indeed
martin
she
said
in
her
failing
plaintive
voice
one
evening
when
julia
and
i
were
both
sitting
with
her
for
we
met
now
without
any
regard
to
etiquette
martin
julia
and
i
have
been
talking
about
your
future
life
while
you
were
away
julia
face
flushed
a
little
she
was
seated
on
a
footstool
by
my
mother
sofa
and
looked
softer
and
gentler
than
i
had
ever
seen
her
look
she
had
been
nursing
my
mother
with
a
devotion
that
had
often
touched
me
and
had
knit
us
to
one
another
by
the
common
bond
of
an
absorbing
interest
certainly
i
had
never
leaned
upon
or
loved
julia
as
i
was
doing
now
there
is
no
chance
of
your
ever
marrying
olivia
now
continued
my
mother
faintly
and
it
is
a
sin
for
you
to
cherish
your
love
for
her
that
is
a
very
plain
duty
martin
such
love
as
i
cherish
for
olivia
will
hurt
neither
her
nor
myself
i
answered
i
would
not
wrong
her
by
a
thought
but
she
can
never
be
your
wife
she
said
i
never
think
of
her
as
my
wife
i
replied
but
i
can
no
more
cease
to
love
her
than
i
can
cease
to
breathe
she
has
become
part
of
my
life
mother
still
time
and
change
must
make
a
difference
she
said
you
will
realize
your
loneliness
when
i
am
gone
though
you
can
not
before
i
want
to
have
some
idea
of
what
you
will
be
doing
in
the
years
to
come
before
we
meet
again
if
i
think
at
all
i
shall
be
thinking
of
you
and
i
do
long
to
have
some
little
notion
you
will
not
mind
me
forming
one
poor
little
plan
for
you
once
more
my
boy
no
i
answered
smiling
to
keep
back
the
tears
that
were
ready
to
start
to
my
eyes
i
scarcely
know
how
to
tell
you
she
said
you
must
not
be
angry
or
offended
with
us
but
my
dear
julia
has
promised
me
out
of
pure
love
and
pity
for
me
you
know
that
if
ever
how
can
i
express
it
if
you
ever
wish
you
could
return
to
the
old
plans
it
may
be
a
long
time
first
but
if
you
conquered
your
love
for
olivia
and
could
go
back
and
wished
to
go
back
to
the
time
before
you
knew
her
julia
will
forget
all
that
has
come
between
julia
would
consent
to
marry
you
if
you
asked
her
to
be
your
wife
o
martin
i
should
die
so
much
happier
if
i
thought
you
would
ever
marry
julia
and
go
to
live
in
the
house
i
helped
to
get
ready
for
you
julia
head
had
dropped
upon
my
mother
shoulder
and
her
face
was
hidden
while
my
mother
eyes
sought
mine
beseechingly
i
was
irresistibly
overcome
by
this
new
proof
of
her
love
for
both
of
us
for
i
knew
well
what
a
struggle
it
must
have
been
to
her
to
gain
the
mastery
over
her
proper
pride
and
just
resentment
i
knelt
down
beside
her
clasping
her
hand
and
my
mother
in
my
own
mother
julia
i
said
i
promise
that
if
ever
i
can
be
true
in
heart
and
soul
to
a
wife
i
will
ask
julia
to
become
mine
but
it
may
be
many
years
hence
i
dare
not
say
how
long
god
alone
knows
how
dear
olivia
is
to
me
and
julia
is
too
good
to
waste
herself
upon
so
foolish
a
fellow
she
may
change
and
see
some
one
she
can
love
better
that
is
nonsense
martin
answered
julia
with
a
ring
of
the
old
sharpness
in
her
tone
at
my
age
i
am
not
likely
to
fall
in
love
do
be
afraid
aunt
i
shall
not
change
and
i
will
take
care
of
martin
his
home
is
ready
and
he
will
come
back
to
me
some
day
and
it
will
all
be
as
you
wish
i
know
that
promise
of
ours
comforted
her
for
she
never
lamented
over
my
coming
solitude
again
i
have
very
little
more
i
can
say
about
her
when
i
look
back
and
try
to
write
more
fully
of
those
last
lingering
days
my
heart
fails
me
the
darkened
room
the
muffled
sounds
the
loitering
creeping
yet
too
rapid
hours
i
had
no
time
to
think
of
julia
of
olivia
or
of
myself
i
was
wrapped
up
in
her
one
evening
we
were
quite
alone
she
called
me
to
come
closer
to
her
in
that
faint
voice
of
hers
which
seemed
already
to
be
speaking
from
another
world
i
was
sitting
so
near
to
her
that
i
could
touch
her
with
my
hand
but
she
wanted
me
nearer
with
my
arm
across
her
and
my
cheek
against
hers
my
boy
she
whispered
i
am
going
not
yet
mother
i
cried
not
yet
i
have
so
much
to
say
stay
with
me
a
day
or
two
longer
if
i
could
she
murmured
every
word
broken
with
her
panting
breath
i
would
stay
with
you
forever
be
patient
with
your
father
martin
say
for
me
to
him
and
julia
do
stir
let
me
die
so
you
shall
not
die
mother
i
said
passionately
there
is
no
pain
she
whispered
no
pain
at
all
it
is
taken
away
i
am
only
sorry
for
my
boy
what
will
he
do
when
i
am
gone
where
are
you
martin
i
am
here
mother
i
answered
close
to
you
o
god
i
would
go
with
you
if
i
could
then
she
lay
still
for
a
time
pressing
my
arm
about
her
with
her
feeble
fingers
would
she
speak
to
me
no
more
had
the
dearest
voice
in
the
world
gone
away
altogether
into
that
and
to
us
silent
country
whither
the
dying
go
dumb
blind
deaf
to
she
was
breathing
yet
and
her
heart
fluttered
faintly
against
my
arm
would
not
my
mother
know
me
again
o
martin
she
murmured
there
is
great
love
in
store
for
us
all
i
did
not
know
how
great
the
love
was
till
now
there
had
been
a
quicker
more
irregular
throbbing
of
her
heart
as
she
spoke
then
i
waited
but
there
came
no
other
pulsation
suddenly
i
felt
as
if
i
also
must
be
dying
for
i
passed
into
a
state
of
utter
darkness
and
unconsciousness
chapter
the
a
disconsolate
widower
my
senses
returned
painfully
with
a
dull
and
blunted
perception
that
some
great
calamity
had
overtaken
me
i
was
in
my
and
julia
was
holding
to
my
nostrils
some
sharp
essence
which
had
penetrated
to
the
brain
and
brought
back
consciousness
my
father
was
sitting
by
the
empty
grate
sobbing
and
weeping
vehemently
the
door
into
my
mother
bedroom
was
closed
i
knew
instantly
what
was
going
on
there
i
suppose
no
man
ever
fainted
without
being
ashamed
of
it
even
in
the
agony
of
my
awakening
consciousness
i
felt
the
inevitable
sting
of
shame
at
my
weakness
and
womanishness
i
pushed
away
julia
hand
and
raised
myself
i
got
up
on
my
feet
and
walked
unsteadily
and
blindly
toward
the
shut
door
martin
said
julia
you
must
not
go
back
there
it
is
all
over
i
heard
my
father
calling
me
in
a
broken
voice
and
i
turned
to
him
his
frame
was
shaken
by
the
violence
of
his
sobs
and
he
could
not
lift
up
his
head
from
his
hands
there
was
no
effort
at
about
him
at
times
his
cries
grew
loud
enough
to
be
heard
all
over
the
house
oh
my
son
he
said
we
shall
never
see
any
one
like
your
poor
mother
again
she
was
the
best
wife
any
man
ever
had
oh
what
a
loss
she
is
to
me
i
could
not
speak
of
her
just
then
nor
could
i
say
a
word
to
comfort
him
she
had
bidden
me
be
patient
with
him
but
already
i
found
the
task
almost
beyond
me
i
told
julia
i
was
going
up
to
my
own
room
for
the
rest
of
the
night
if
there
were
nothing
for
me
to
do
she
put
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
kissed
me
as
if
she
had
been
my
sister
telling
me
i
could
leave
every
thing
to
her
then
i
went
away
into
the
solitude
that
had
indeed
begun
to
close
around
me
when
the
heart
of
a
man
is
solitary
there
is
no
society
for
him
even
among
a
crowd
of
friends
all
deep
love
and
close
companionship
seemed
stricken
out
of
my
life
we
laid
her
in
the
cemetery
in
a
grave
where
the
branches
of
some
threw
a
pleasant
shadow
over
it
during
the
day
at
times
the
moan
of
the
sea
could
be
heard
there
when
the
surf
rolled
in
strongly
upon
the
shore
of
cobo
bay
the
white
crest
of
the
waves
could
be
seen
from
it
tossing
over
the
sunken
reefs
at
sea
yet
it
lay
in
the
heart
of
our
island
she
had
chosen
the
spot
for
herself
not
very
long
ago
when
we
had
been
there
together
now
i
went
there
alone
i
counted
my
father
and
his
loud
grief
as
nothing
there
was
neither
sympathy
nor
companionship
between
us
he
was
very
vehement
in
his
lamentations
repeating
to
every
one
who
came
to
condole
with
us
that
there
never
had
lived
such
a
wife
and
his
loss
was
the
greatest
that
man
could
bear
his
loss
was
nothing
to
mine
yet
i
did
draw
a
little
nearer
to
him
in
the
first
few
weeks
of
our
bereavement
almost
insensibly
i
fell
into
our
old
plan
of
sharing
the
practice
for
he
was
often
unfit
to
go
out
and
see
our
patients
the
house
was
very
desolate
now
and
soon
lost
those
little
delicate
traces
of
feminine
occupancy
which
constitute
the
charm
of
a
home
and
to
which
we
had
been
all
our
lives
accustomed
julia
could
not
leave
her
own
household
even
if
it
had
been
possible
for
her
to
return
to
her
place
in
our
deserted
dwelling
the
flowers
faded
and
died
unchanged
in
the
vases
and
there
was
no
dainty
woman
work
lying
about
that
litter
of
white
and
colored
shreds
of
silk
and
muslin
which
give
to
a
room
an
inhabited
appearance
these
were
so
familiar
to
me
that
the
total
absence
of
them
was
like
the
barrenness
of
a
garden
without
flowers
in
bloom
my
father
did
not
feel
this
as
i
did
for
he
was
not
often
at
home
after
the
first
violence
of
his
grief
had
spent
itself
julia
house
was
open
to
him
in
a
manner
it
could
not
be
open
to
me
i
was
made
welcome
there
it
is
true
but
julia
was
not
unembarrassed
and
at
home
with
me
the
renewed
between
us
rendered
it
difficult
to
us
both
to
meet
on
the
simple
ground
of
friendship
and
relationship
moreover
i
shrank
from
setting
gossips
tongues
going
again
on
the
subject
of
my
chances
of
marrying
my
cousin
so
i
remained
at
home
alone
evening
after
evening
unless
i
was
called
out
professionally
declining
all
invitations
and
brooding
unwholesomely
over
my
grief
there
is
no
more
cowardly
a
way
of
meeting
a
sorrow
but
i
was
out
of
heart
and
no
words
could
better
express
the
morbid
melancholy
i
was
sinking
into
there
was
some
tedious
legal
business
to
go
through
for
my
small
property
bringing
in
a
hundred
a
year
came
to
me
on
her
death
i
could
not
alienate
it
but
i
wished
julia
to
receive
the
income
as
part
payment
of
my
father
defalcations
she
would
not
listen
to
such
a
proposal
and
she
showed
me
that
she
had
a
shrewd
notion
of
the
true
state
of
our
finances
they
were
in
such
a
state
that
if
i
left
guernsey
with
my
little
income
my
father
would
positively
find
some
difficulty
in
making
both
ends
meet
the
more
so
as
i
was
becoming
decidedly
the
favorite
with
our
patients
who
began
to
call
him
slightingly
the
old
doctor
no
path
opened
up
for
me
in
any
other
direction
it
appeared
as
if
i
were
to
be
bound
to
the
place
which
was
no
longer
a
home
to
me
i
wrote
to
this
effect
to
jack
senior
who
was
urging
my
return
to
england
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
believe
that
this
dreary
monotonous
routine
of
professional
duties
of
very
little
interest
or
importance
was
all
that
life
should
offer
to
me
yet
for
the
present
my
duty
was
plain
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
made
some
inquiries
at
the
in
vauvert
road
and
learned
that
the
person
who
had
been
in
search
of
olivia
had
left
guernsey
about
the
time
when
i
was
so
fully
engrossed
with
my
mother
as
to
have
but
little
thought
for
any
one
else
of
olivia
there
was
neither
trace
nor
tidings
tardif
came
up
to
see
me
whenever
he
crossed
over
from
sark
but
he
had
no
information
to
give
to
me
the
chances
were
that
she
was
in
london
but
she
was
as
much
lost
to
me
as
if
she
had
been
lying
beside
my
mother
under
the
green
turf
of
foulon
cemetery
chapter
the
the
widower
comforted
in
this
manner
three
months
passed
slowly
away
after
my
mother
death
dobrée
who
was
utterly
inconsolable
the
first
few
weeks
fell
into
all
his
old
maundering
philandering
ways
again
spending
hours
upon
his
toilet
and
paying
devoted
attentions
to
every
passable
woman
who
came
across
his
path
my
temper
grew
like
the
least
spark
would
set
it
in
a
blaze
i
could
not
take
such
things
in
good
part
we
had
been
at
for
a
day
or
two
he
and
i
when
one
morning
i
was
astonished
by
the
appearance
of
julia
in
our
soon
after
my
father
having
dressed
himself
elaborately
had
quitted
the
house
julia
face
was
ominous
the
upper
lip
very
straight
and
a
frown
upon
her
brow
i
wondered
what
could
be
the
matter
but
i
held
my
tongue
my
knowledge
of
julia
was
intimate
enough
for
me
to
hit
upon
the
right
moment
for
speech
or
silence
a
rare
advantage
it
was
the
time
to
refrain
from
speaking
julia
was
no
termagant
simply
a
woman
who
had
had
her
own
way
all
her
life
and
was
so
sure
it
was
the
best
way
that
she
could
not
understand
why
other
people
should
wish
to
have
theirs
martin
she
began
in
a
low
key
but
one
that
might
run
up
to
shrillness
if
advisable
i
am
come
to
tell
you
something
that
fills
me
with
shame
and
anger
i
do
not
know
how
to
contain
myself
i
could
never
have
believed
that
i
could
have
been
so
blind
and
foolish
but
it
seems
as
if
i
were
doomed
to
be
deceived
and
disappointed
on
every
hand
i
who
would
not
deceive
or
disappoint
anybody
in
the
world
i
declare
it
makes
me
quite
ill
to
think
of
it
just
look
at
my
hands
how
they
tremble
your
nervous
system
is
out
of
order
i
remarked
it
is
the
world
that
is
out
of
order
she
said
petulantly
i
am
well
enough
oh
i
do
not
know
how
ever
i
am
to
tell
you
there
are
some
things
it
is
a
shame
to
speak
of
must
you
speak
of
them
i
asked
yes
you
must
know
you
will
have
to
know
all
sooner
or
later
if
there
was
any
hope
of
it
coming
to
nothing
i
should
try
to
spare
you
this
but
they
are
both
so
bent
upon
disgracing
themselves
so
deaf
to
reason
if
my
poor
dear
aunt
knew
of
it
she
could
not
rest
in
her
grave
martin
can
not
you
guess
are
men
born
so
dull
that
they
can
not
see
what
is
going
on
under
their
own
eyes
i
have
not
the
least
idea
of
what
you
are
driving
at
i
answered
sit
down
my
dear
julia
and
calm
yourself
shall
i
give
you
a
glass
of
wine
no
no
she
said
with
a
gesture
of
impatience
how
long
is
it
since
my
poor
dear
aunt
died
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
i
replied
wondering
that
she
should
touch
the
wound
so
roughly
three
months
next
sunday
and
dobrée
she
said
in
a
bitter
accent
then
stopped
looking
me
full
in
the
face
i
had
never
heard
her
call
my
father
dobrée
in
my
life
she
was
very
fond
of
him
and
attracted
by
him
as
most
women
were
and
as
few
women
are
attracted
by
me
even
now
with
all
the
difference
in
our
age
the
advantage
being
on
my
side
it
was
seldom
i
succeeded
in
pleasing
as
much
as
he
did
i
gazed
back
in
amazement
at
julia
dark
and
moody
face
what
now
i
asked
what
has
my
unlucky
father
been
doing
now
why
she
exclaimed
stamping
her
foot
while
the
blood
mantled
to
her
forehead
dobrée
is
in
haste
to
take
a
second
wife
he
is
indeed
my
poor
martin
he
wishes
to
be
married
immediately
to
that
viper
kate
daltrey
impossible
i
cried
stung
to
the
quick
by
these
words
i
remembered
my
mother
mild
instinctive
dislike
to
kate
daltrey
and
her
harmless
hope
that
i
would
not
go
over
to
her
side
go
over
to
her
side
no
if
she
set
her
foot
into
this
house
as
my
mother
successor
i
would
never
dwell
under
the
same
roof
as
soon
as
my
father
made
her
his
wife
i
would
cut
myself
adrift
from
them
both
but
he
knew
that
he
would
never
venture
to
outrage
my
mother
memory
or
my
feelings
in
such
a
flagrant
manner
it
is
possible
for
it
is
true
said
julia
she
had
not
let
her
voice
rise
above
its
low
angry
key
and
now
it
sank
nearly
to
a
whisper
as
she
glanced
round
at
the
door
they
have
understood
each
other
these
four
weeks
you
may
call
it
an
engagement
for
it
is
one
and
i
never
suspected
them
not
for
a
moment
he
came
down
to
my
house
to
be
comforted
he
said
his
house
was
so
dreary
now
and
i
was
as
blind
as
a
mole
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
dear
martin
i
knew
he
was
given
to
all
that
kind
of
thing
but
then
he
seemed
to
mourn
for
my
poor
aunt
so
deeply
and
was
so
he
made
ten
times
more
show
of
it
than
you
did
i
have
heard
people
say
you
bore
it
very
well
and
were
quite
unmoved
but
i
knew
better
everybody
said
could
never
get
over
it
could
you
take
out
a
commission
of
lunacy
against
him
he
must
be
mad
to
think
of
such
a
thing
how
did
you
find
it
out
i
inquired
oh
i
was
so
ashamed
she
said
you
see
i
had
not
the
faintest
shadow
of
a
suspicion
i
had
left
them
in
the
to
go
and
i
thought
of
something
i
wanted
and
went
back
suddenly
and
there
they
were
his
arm
around
her
waist
and
her
head
on
his
shoulder
he
with
his
gray
hairs
too
she
says
she
is
the
same
age
as
me
but
she
is
forty
if
she
is
a
day
the
simpletons
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
or
how
to
look
i
could
not
get
out
of
the
room
again
as
if
i
had
not
seen
for
i
cried
at
the
first
sight
of
them
then
i
stood
staring
at
them
but
i
think
they
felt
as
uncomfortable
as
i
did
what
did
they
say
i
asked
sternly
oh
he
came
up
to
me
quite
in
his
dramatic
way
you
know
trying
to
carry
it
off
by
looking
grand
and
majestic
and
he
was
going
to
take
my
hand
and
lead
me
to
her
but
i
would
not
stir
a
step
love
he
said
am
about
to
steal
your
friend
from
you
is
no
friend
of
mine
i
said
she
is
going
to
be
what
all
this
intimates
i
suppose
i
will
never
speak
to
her
or
you
again
dr
dobrée
upon
that
he
began
to
weep
and
protest
and
declaim
while
she
sat
still
and
glared
at
me
i
never
thought
her
eyes
could
look
like
that
do
you
mean
to
be
married
i
asked
for
he
made
no
secret
of
his
intention
to
make
her
his
wife
is
the
good
of
waiting
he
said
home
is
miserable
with
no
woman
in
it
i
said
you
will
promise
me
to
give
up
the
idea
of
a
second
marriage
which
is
ridiculous
at
your
age
i
will
come
back
to
you
in
spite
of
all
the
awkwardness
of
my
position
with
regard
to
martin
for
my
aunt
sake
i
will
come
back
even
an
arrangement
like
this
would
be
better
than
his
marriage
with
that
woman
do
you
think
so
a
hundred
times
better
i
said
warmly
it
was
very
good
of
you
julia
but
he
would
not
agree
to
that
would
he
he
would
hear
of
it
he
swore
that
kate
was
as
dear
to
him
as
ever
my
poor
aunt
was
he
vowed
he
could
not
live
without
her
and
her
companionship
he
maintained
that
his
age
did
not
make
it
ridiculous
kate
hid
her
brazen
face
in
her
hands
and
sobbed
aloud
that
made
him
ten
times
worse
an
idiot
he
knelt
down
before
her
and
implored
her
to
look
at
him
i
reminded
him
how
all
the
island
would
rise
against
him
worse
than
it
did
against
you
martin
and
he
declared
he
did
not
care
a
fig
for
the
island
i
asked
him
how
he
would
face
the
careys
and
the
brocks
and
the
de
saumarez
and
all
the
rest
of
them
and
he
snapped
his
fingers
at
them
all
oh
he
must
be
going
out
of
his
mind
i
shook
my
head
knowing
him
as
thoroughly
as
a
long
and
close
study
could
help
me
to
know
any
man
i
was
less
surprised
than
julia
who
had
only
seen
him
from
a
woman
point
of
view
and
had
always
been
lenient
to
his
faults
unfortunately
i
knew
my
father
too
well
then
i
talked
to
him
about
the
duty
he
owed
to
our
family
name
she
resumed
and
i
went
so
far
as
to
remind
him
of
what
i
had
done
to
shield
him
and
it
from
disgrace
and
he
mocked
at
it
positively
mocked
at
it
he
said
there
was
no
sort
of
parallel
it
would
be
no
dishonor
to
our
house
to
receive
kate
into
it
even
if
they
were
married
at
once
what
did
it
signify
to
the
world
that
only
three
months
had
elapsed
besides
he
did
not
mean
to
marry
her
for
a
month
to
come
as
the
house
would
need
beautifying
for
her
beautifying
for
her
neither
had
he
spoken
of
it
to
you
but
he
had
no
doubt
you
would
be
willing
to
go
on
as
you
have
done
never
i
said
i
was
sure
not
continued
julia
i
told
him
i
was
convinced
you
would
leave
guernsey
again
but
he
that
i
asked
him
how
he
was
to
live
without
any
practice
and
he
said
his
old
patients
might
turn
him
off
for
a
while
but
they
would
be
glad
to
send
for
him
again
i
never
saw
a
man
so
obstinately
bent
upon
his
own
ruin
julia
i
said
i
shall
leave
guernsey
before
this
marriage
can
come
off
i
would
rather
break
stones
on
the
highway
than
stay
to
see
that
woman
in
my
mother
place
my
mother
disliked
her
from
the
first
i
know
it
she
replied
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
i
thought
it
was
nothing
but
prejudice
it
was
my
fault
bringing
her
to
guernsey
but
i
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
her
coming
as
mistress
here
i
said
so
distinctly
dobrée
i
said
must
let
me
remind
you
that
the
house
is
mine
though
you
have
paid
me
no
rent
for
years
if
you
ever
take
kate
daltrey
into
it
i
will
put
my
affairs
into
a
notary
hands
i
will
upon
my
word
and
julia
dobrée
never
broke
her
word
yet
that
brought
him
to
his
senses
better
than
any
thing
he
turned
very
pale
and
sat
down
beside
kate
hardly
knowing
what
to
say
then
she
began
she
said
if
i
was
cruel
she
would
be
cruel
too
whatever
grieved
you
martin
would
grieve
me
and
she
would
let
her
brother
richard
foster
know
where
olivia
was
does
she
know
where
she
is
i
asked
eagerly
in
a
tumult
of
surprise
and
hope
why
in
sark
of
course
she
replied
what
did
you
never
know
that
olivia
left
sark
before
my
death
i
said
with
a
chill
of
disappointment
did
i
never
tell
you
she
was
gone
nobody
knows
where
you
have
never
spoken
of
her
in
my
hearing
except
once
you
recollect
when
martin
we
have
supposed
she
was
still
living
in
tardif
house
then
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
me
from
carrying
out
my
threat
kate
daltrey
shall
never
enter
this
house
as
mistress
would
you
have
given
it
up
for
olivia
sake
i
asked
marvelling
at
her
generosity
i
should
have
done
it
for
your
sake
she
answered
frankly
but
i
said
reverting
to
our
original
topic
if
my
father
has
set
his
mind
upon
marrying
kate
daltrey
he
will
brave
any
thing
he
is
a
dotard
replied
julia
he
positively
makes
me
dread
growing
old
who
knows
what
follies
one
may
be
guilty
of
in
old
age
i
never
felt
afraid
of
it
before
kate
says
she
has
two
hundred
a
year
of
her
own
and
they
will
go
and
live
on
that
in
jersey
if
guernsey
becomes
unpleasant
to
them
martin
she
is
a
viper
she
is
indeed
and
i
have
made
such
a
friend
of
her
now
i
shall
have
no
one
but
you
and
the
careys
why
was
i
satisfied
with
johanna
as
my
friend
she
stayed
an
hour
longer
turning
over
this
unwelcome
subject
till
we
had
thoroughly
discussed
every
point
of
it
in
the
evening
after
dinner
i
spoke
to
my
father
briefly
but
decisively
upon
the
same
topic
after
a
very
short
and
very
sharp
conversation
there
remained
no
alternative
for
me
but
to
make
up
my
mind
to
try
my
fortune
once
more
out
of
guernsey
i
wrote
by
the
next
mail
to
jack
senior
telling
him
my
purpose
and
the
cause
of
it
and
by
return
of
post
i
received
his
reply
dear
old
boy
why
should
you
come
and
go
halves
with
me
dad
says
so
he
is
giving
up
shop
and
going
to
live
in
the
country
at
fulham
house
and
practice
are
miles
too
big
for
me
and
dobrée
or
and
senior
whichever
you
please
if
you
come
i
can
pay
dutiful
attention
to
dad
without
losing
my
customers
that
is
his
chief
reason
mine
is
that
i
only
feel
half
myself
without
you
at
hand
do
think
of
saying
no
jack
it
was
a
splendid
opening
without
question
senior
had
been
in
good
practice
for
more
than
thirty
years
and
he
had
quietly
introduced
jack
to
the
position
he
was
about
to
resign
yet
i
pondered
over
the
proposal
for
a
whole
week
before
agreeing
to
it
i
knew
jack
well
enough
to
be
sure
he
would
never
regret
his
generosity
but
if
i
went
i
would
go
as
junior
partner
and
with
a
much
smaller
proportion
of
the
profits
than
that
proffered
by
jack
finally
i
resolved
to
accept
the
offer
and
wrote
to
him
as
to
the
terms
upon
which
alone
i
would
join
him
chapter
the
final
arrangements
i
did
not
wait
for
my
father
to
commit
the
irreparable
folly
of
his
second
marriage
guernsey
had
become
hateful
to
me
in
spite
of
my
exceeding
love
for
my
native
island
more
beautiful
in
the
eyes
of
its
people
than
any
other
spot
on
earth
i
could
no
longer
be
happy
or
at
peace
there
a
few
persons
urged
me
to
stay
and
live
down
my
chagrin
and
grief
but
most
of
my
friends
congratulated
me
on
the
change
in
my
prospects
and
bade
me
julia
could
not
conceal
her
regret
but
i
left
her
in
the
charge
of
captain
carey
and
johanna
she
promised
to
be
my
faithful
correspondent
and
i
engaged
to
write
to
her
regularly
there
existed
between
us
the
to
which
we
had
pledged
ourselves
at
my
mother
urgent
request
she
would
wait
for
the
time
when
olivia
was
no
longer
the
first
in
my
heart
then
she
would
be
willing
to
become
my
wife
but
if
ever
that
day
came
she
would
require
me
to
give
up
my
position
in
england
and
settle
down
for
life
in
guernsey
fairly
then
i
was
launched
upon
the
career
of
a
physician
in
the
great
city
the
completeness
of
the
change
suited
me
nothing
here
in
scenery
atmosphere
or
society
could
remind
me
of
the
fretted
past
the
troubled
waters
subsided
into
a
dull
calm
as
far
as
emotional
life
went
intellectual
life
on
the
contrary
was
quickened
in
its
current
and
day
after
day
drifted
me
farther
away
from
painful
memories
to
be
sure
the
idea
crossed
me
often
that
olivia
might
be
in
london
even
in
the
same
street
with
me
i
never
caught
sight
of
a
faded
green
dress
but
my
steps
were
hurried
and
i
followed
till
i
was
sure
that
the
wearer
was
not
olivia
but
i
was
aware
that
the
chances
of
our
meeting
were
so
small
that
i
could
not
count
upon
them
even
if
i
found
her
what
then
she
was
as
far
away
from
me
as
though
the
atlantic
rolled
between
us
if
i
only
knew
that
she
was
safe
and
as
happy
as
her
sad
destiny
could
let
her
be
i
would
be
content
for
this
assurance
i
looked
forward
through
the
long
months
that
must
intervene
before
her
promised
communication
would
come
to
tardif
thus
i
was
thrown
entirely
upon
my
profession
for
interest
and
occupation
i
gave
myself
up
to
it
with
an
energy
that
amazed
jack
and
sometimes
surprised
myself
senior
who
was
an
old
veteran
loved
it
with
ardor
for
its
own
sake
was
delighted
with
my
enthusiasm
he
prophesied
great
things
for
me
so
passed
my
first
winter
in
london
chapter
the
the
tables
turned
a
dreary
season
was
that
first
winter
in
london
it
happened
quite
naturally
that
here
as
in
guernsey
my
share
of
the
practice
fell
among
the
lower
and
least
important
class
of
patients
jack
senior
had
been
on
the
field
some
years
sooner
and
he
was
and
all
the
surroundings
of
his
life
fitted
him
without
a
wrinkle
he
was
at
home
everywhere
and
would
have
counted
the
pulse
of
a
duchess
with
as
little
emotion
as
that
of
a
on
the
other
hand
i
could
not
accommodate
myself
altogether
to
haughty
and
aristocratic
strangers
though
i
am
somewhat
later
experiences
for
during
the
winter
our
fashionable
clients
were
all
out
of
town
and
our
time
comparatively
unoccupied
to
be
at
ease
anywhere
it
was
at
that
time
essential
to
me
to
know
something
of
the
people
with
whom
i
was
associating
an
insular
trait
common
to
all
those
who
are
brought
up
in
a
contracted
and
isolated
circle
besides
this
rustic
embarrassment
which
hung
like
a
clog
about
me
i
missed
wofully
the
dainty
feminine
ways
i
had
been
used
to
there
was
a
trusty
female
servant
half
cook
half
who
lived
in
the
and
superintended
our
household
but
she
was
not
at
all
the
angel
in
the
house
whom
i
needed
it
was
a
handsome
dwelling
but
it
was
terribly
gloomy
the
heavy
substantial
leather
chairs
always
remained
undisturbed
in
level
rows
against
the
wall
and
the
crimson
cloth
upon
the
table
was
as
bare
as
a
a
thimble
lying
upon
it
or
fallen
on
the
carpet
and
almost
crushed
by
my
careless
tread
would
have
been
as
welcome
a
sight
to
me
as
a
blade
of
grass
or
a
spring
of
water
in
some
sandy
desert
the
sound
of
a
light
foot
and
rustling
dress
and
low
soft
voice
would
have
been
the
sweetest
music
in
my
ears
if
a
young
fellow
of
with
an
excellent
appetite
and
in
good
health
could
be
said
to
pine
i
was
pining
for
the
pretty
fondling
woman
ways
which
had
quite
vanished
out
of
my
life
at
times
my
thoughts
dwelt
upon
my
to
julia
as
soon
as
i
could
dethrone
the
image
of
olivia
from
its
in
my
heart
she
was
willing
to
welcome
me
back
again
a
prodigal
suitor
who
had
spent
all
his
living
in
a
far
country
we
corresponded
regularly
and
frequently
and
julia
letters
were
always
good
sensible
and
affectionate
if
our
marriage
and
all
the
sequel
to
it
could
have
been
conducted
by
epistles
nothing
could
have
been
more
satisfactory
but
i
felt
a
little
doubtful
about
the
termination
of
this
platonic
friendship
with
its
it
did
not
appear
to
me
that
olivia
image
was
fading
in
the
slightest
degree
no
though
i
knew
her
to
be
married
though
i
was
ignorant
where
she
was
though
there
was
not
the
faintest
hope
within
me
that
she
would
ever
become
mine
during
the
quiet
solitary
evenings
while
jack
was
away
at
some
ball
or
concert
to
which
i
had
no
heart
to
go
my
thoughts
were
pretty
equally
divided
between
my
lost
mother
and
my
lost
olivia
lost
in
such
different
ways
it
would
have
grieved
julia
in
her
very
soul
if
she
could
have
known
how
rarely
in
comparison
i
thought
of
her
yet
on
the
whole
there
was
a
certain
sweetness
in
feeling
myself
not
altogether
cut
off
from
womanly
love
and
sympathy
there
was
a
home
always
open
to
me
a
home
and
a
wife
devotedly
attached
to
me
whenever
i
chose
to
claim
them
that
was
not
unpleasant
as
a
prospect
as
soon
as
this
low
fever
of
the
spirit
was
over
there
was
a
convalescent
hospital
to
go
to
where
it
might
recover
its
original
tone
and
vigor
at
present
the
fever
had
too
firm
and
strong
a
hold
for
me
to
pronounce
myself
convalescent
but
if
i
were
to
believe
all
that
sages
had
said
there
would
come
a
time
when
i
should
rejoice
over
my
own
recovery
early
in
the
spring
i
received
a
letter
from
julia
desiring
me
to
look
out
for
apartments
somewhere
in
my
neighborhood
for
herself
and
johanna
and
captain
carey
they
were
coming
to
london
to
spend
two
or
three
months
of
the
season
i
had
not
had
any
task
so
agreeable
since
i
left
guernsey
jack
was
hospitably
anxious
for
them
to
come
to
our
own
house
but
i
knew
they
would
not
listen
to
such
a
proposal
i
found
some
suitable
rooms
for
them
however
in
hanover
street
where
i
could
be
with
them
at
any
time
in
five
minutes
on
the
appointed
day
i
met
them
at
waterloo
station
and
installed
them
in
their
new
apartments
it
struck
me
that
notwithstanding
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
julia
was
looking
better
and
happier
than
i
had
seen
her
look
for
a
long
time
her
black
dress
suited
her
and
gave
her
a
style
which
she
never
had
in
colors
her
complexion
looked
dark
but
not
sallow
and
her
brown
hair
was
certainly
more
becomingly
arranged
her
appearance
was
that
of
a
cultivated
almost
elegant
woman
of
whom
no
man
need
be
ashamed
johanna
was
simply
herself
without
the
least
perceptible
change
but
captain
carey
again
looked
ten
years
younger
and
was
evidently
taking
pains
with
his
appearance
that
suit
of
his
had
never
been
made
in
guernsey
it
must
have
come
out
of
a
london
establishment
his
hair
was
not
so
gray
and
his
face
was
less
hypochondriac
he
assured
me
that
his
health
had
been
wonderfully
good
all
the
winter
i
was
more
than
satisfied
i
was
proud
of
all
my
friends
we
want
you
to
come
and
have
a
long
talk
with
us
said
johanna
it
is
too
late
we
shall
be
busy
shopping
in
the
morning
but
can
you
come
in
the
evening
oh
yes
i
answered
i
am
at
leisure
most
evenings
and
i
count
upon
spending
them
with
you
i
can
escort
you
to
as
many
places
of
amusement
as
you
wish
to
visit
then
she
said
we
shall
take
tea
at
eight
i
bade
them
with
a
lighter
heart
than
i
had
felt
for
a
long
while
i
held
julia
hand
the
longest
looking
into
her
face
earnestly
till
it
flushed
and
glowed
a
little
under
my
scrutiny
true
heart
i
said
to
myself
true
and
constant
and
i
have
nothing
and
shall
have
nothing
to
offer
it
but
the
ashes
of
a
dead
passion
would
to
heaven
i
thought
as
i
paced
along
brook
street
i
had
never
been
fated
to
see
olivia
i
was
punctual
to
my
time
the
next
day
the
dull
stiff
was
already
invested
with
those
tokens
of
feminine
occupancy
which
i
missed
so
greatly
in
our
much
handsomer
house
there
were
flowers
blooming
in
the
centre
of
the
and
little
lay
strewed
about
julia
stood
on
a
little
stand
near
the
window
there
was
the
rustle
and
movement
of
their
dresses
the
noiseless
footsteps
the
subdued
voices
caressing
my
ear
i
sat
among
them
quiet
and
silent
but
revelling
in
this
partial
return
of
olden
times
when
julia
poured
out
my
tea
and
passed
it
to
me
with
her
white
hand
i
felt
inclined
to
kiss
her
jewelled
fingers
if
captain
carey
had
not
been
present
i
think
i
should
have
done
so
we
lingered
over
the
pleasant
meal
as
if
time
were
made
expressly
for
that
purpose
instead
of
hurrying
over
it
as
jack
and
i
were
wont
to
do
at
the
close
captain
carey
announced
that
he
was
about
to
leave
us
alone
together
for
an
hour
or
two
i
went
down
to
the
door
with
him
for
he
had
made
me
a
mysterious
signal
to
follow
him
in
the
hall
he
laid
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
and
whispered
a
few
incomprehensible
sentences
into
my
ear
do
think
any
thing
of
me
my
boy
do
sacrifice
yourself
for
me
i
an
old
fellow
compared
to
you
though
i
not
fifty
yet
everybody
in
guernsey
knows
that
so
put
me
out
of
the
question
martin
many
a
slip
the
cup
and
the
lip
that
i
know
quite
well
my
dear
fellow
he
was
gone
before
i
could
ask
for
an
explanation
and
i
saw
him
tearing
off
toward
regent
street
i
returned
to
the
pondering
over
his
words
johanna
and
julia
were
sitting
side
by
side
on
a
sofa
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
room
though
the
light
was
by
no
means
brilliant
anywhere
for
the
three
were
set
in
such
a
manner
as
not
to
turn
on
much
gas
come
here
martin
said
johanna
we
wish
to
consult
you
on
a
subject
of
great
importance
to
us
all
i
drew
up
a
chair
opposite
to
them
and
sat
down
much
as
if
it
was
about
to
be
a
medical
consultation
i
felt
almost
as
if
i
must
feel
somebody
pulse
and
look
at
somebody
tongue
it
is
nearly
eight
months
since
your
poor
dear
mother
died
remarked
johanna
eight
months
yes
and
no
one
knew
what
those
eight
months
had
been
to
me
how
desolate
how
empty
you
recollect
continued
johanna
how
her
heart
was
set
on
your
marriage
with
julia
and
the
promise
you
both
made
to
her
on
her
yes
i
answered
bending
forward
and
pressing
julia
hand
i
remember
every
word
there
was
a
minute
silence
after
this
and
i
waited
in
some
wonder
as
to
what
this
prelude
was
leading
to
martin
asked
johanna
in
a
solemn
tone
are
you
forgetting
olivia
no
i
said
dropping
julia
hand
as
the
image
of
olivia
flashed
across
me
reproachfully
not
at
all
what
would
you
have
me
say
she
is
as
dear
to
me
at
this
moment
as
she
ever
was
i
thought
you
would
say
so
she
replied
i
did
not
think
yours
was
a
love
that
would
quickly
pass
away
if
it
ever
does
there
are
men
who
can
love
with
the
constancy
of
a
woman
do
you
know
any
thing
of
her
nothing
i
said
despondently
i
have
no
clew
as
to
where
she
may
be
now
nor
has
tardif
she
continued
my
brother
and
i
went
across
to
sark
last
week
to
ask
him
that
was
very
good
of
you
i
interrupted
it
was
partly
for
our
own
sakes
she
said
blushing
faintly
martin
tardif
says
that
if
you
have
once
loved
olivia
it
is
once
for
all
you
would
never
conquer
it
do
you
think
that
this
is
true
be
candid
with
us
yes
i
answered
it
is
true
i
could
never
love
again
as
i
love
olivia
then
my
dear
martin
said
johanna
very
softly
do
you
wish
to
keep
julia
to
her
promise
i
started
violently
what
did
julia
wish
to
be
released
from
that
and
be
free
was
it
possible
that
any
one
else
coveted
my
place
in
her
affections
and
in
the
new
house
which
we
had
fitted
up
for
ourselves
i
felt
like
the
dog
in
the
manger
it
seemed
an
encroachment
for
any
person
to
come
between
my
cousin
julia
and
me
do
you
ask
me
to
set
you
free
from
your
promise
julia
i
asked
somewhat
sternly
why
martin
she
said
averting
her
face
from
me
you
know
i
should
never
consent
to
marry
you
with
the
idea
of
your
caring
most
for
that
girl
no
i
could
never
do
that
if
i
believed
you
would
ever
think
of
me
as
you
used
to
do
before
you
saw
her
well
i
would
keep
true
to
you
but
is
there
any
hope
of
that
let
us
be
frank
with
one
another
i
answered
tell
me
is
there
any
one
else
whom
you
would
marry
if
i
release
you
from
this
promise
which
was
only
given
perhaps
to
soothe
my
mothers
last
hours
julia
hung
her
head
and
did
not
speak
her
lips
trembled
i
saw
her
take
johanna
hand
and
squeeze
it
as
if
to
urge
her
to
answer
the
question
martin
said
johanna
your
happiness
is
dear
to
every
one
of
us
if
we
had
believed
there
was
any
hope
of
your
learning
to
love
julia
as
she
deserves
and
as
a
man
ought
to
love
his
wife
not
a
word
of
this
would
have
been
spoken
but
we
all
feel
there
is
no
such
hope
only
say
there
is
and
we
will
not
utter
another
word
no
i
said
you
must
tell
me
all
now
i
can
not
let
the
question
rest
here
is
there
any
one
else
whom
julia
would
marry
if
she
felt
quite
free
yes
answered
johanna
while
julia
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
she
would
marry
my
brother
captain
carey
i
fairly
gasped
for
breath
such
an
idea
had
never
once
occurred
to
me
though
i
knew
she
had
been
spending
most
of
her
time
with
the
careys
at
the
vale
captain
carey
to
marry
and
to
marry
julia
to
go
and
live
in
our
house
i
was
struck
dumb
and
fancied
that
i
had
heard
wrongly
all
the
pleasant
distant
vision
of
a
possible
marriage
with
julia
when
my
passion
had
died
out
and
i
could
be
content
in
my
affection
and
esteem
for
her
all
this
vanished
away
and
left
my
whole
future
a
blank
if
julia
wished
for
revenge
and
when
is
not
revenge
sweet
to
a
jilted
woman
she
had
it
now
i
was
as
crestfallen
as
amazed
almost
as
miserable
as
she
had
been
yet
i
had
no
one
to
blame
as
she
had
how
could
i
blame
her
for
preferring
captain
carey
love
to
my
affections
julia
i
said
after
a
long
silence
and
speaking
as
calmly
as
i
could
do
you
love
captain
carey
that
is
not
a
fair
question
to
ask
answered
johanna
we
have
not
been
treacherous
to
you
i
scarcely
know
how
it
has
all
come
about
but
my
brother
has
never
asked
julia
if
she
loves
him
for
we
wished
to
see
you
first
and
hear
how
you
felt
about
olivia
you
say
you
shall
never
love
again
as
you
love
her
set
julia
free
then
quite
free
to
accept
my
brother
or
reject
him
be
generous
be
yourself
martin
i
will
i
my
dear
julia
you
are
as
free
as
air
from
all
obligation
to
me
you
have
been
very
good
and
very
true
to
me
if
captain
carey
is
as
good
and
true
to
you
as
i
believe
he
will
be
you
will
be
a
very
happy
woman
happier
than
you
would
ever
be
with
me
and
you
will
not
make
yourself
unhappy
about
it
asked
julia
looking
up
no
i
answered
cheerfully
i
shall
be
a
merry
old
bachelor
and
visit
you
and
captain
carey
when
we
are
all
old
folks
never
mind
me
julia
i
never
was
good
enough
for
you
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
know
that
you
are
happy
yet
when
i
found
myself
in
the
street
for
i
made
my
escape
as
soon
as
i
could
get
away
from
them
i
felt
as
if
every
thing
worth
living
for
were
slipping
away
from
me
my
mother
and
olivia
were
gone
and
here
was
julia
forsaking
me
i
did
not
grudge
her
her
new
happiness
there
was
neither
jealousy
nor
envy
in
my
feelings
toward
my
supplanter
but
in
some
way
i
felt
that
i
had
lost
a
great
deal
since
i
entered
their
two
hours
ago
chapter
the
olivia
husband
i
did
not
go
straight
home
to
our
dull
gloomy
bachelor
for
i
was
not
in
the
mood
for
an
hour
soliloquy
jack
and
i
had
undertaken
between
us
the
charge
of
the
patients
belonging
to
a
friend
of
ours
who
had
been
called
out
of
town
for
a
few
days
i
was
passing
by
the
house
chewing
the
bitter
cud
of
my
reflections
and
recalling
this
i
turned
in
to
see
if
any
messages
were
waiting
there
for
us
lowry
footman
told
me
a
person
had
been
with
an
urgent
request
that
he
would
go
as
soon
as
possible
to
no
bellringer
street
i
did
not
know
the
street
or
what
sort
of
a
locality
it
was
in
what
kind
of
a
person
called
i
asked
a
woman
sir
not
a
lady
on
foot
poorly
dressed
she
been
here
before
and
lowry
has
visited
the
case
twice
no
bellringer
street
perhaps
you
will
find
him
in
the
sir
i
went
in
to
consult
the
half
a
dozen
words
contained
the
diagnosis
it
was
the
same
disease
in
an
incipient
form
of
which
my
poor
mother
died
i
resolved
to
go
and
see
this
sufferer
at
once
late
as
the
hour
was
did
the
person
expect
some
one
to
go
i
asked
as
i
passed
through
the
hall
i
could
promise
her
that
sir
was
the
answer
i
did
say
i
send
on
the
message
to
you
and
i
was
just
coming
with
it
sir
she
said
she
sit
up
till
twelve
very
good
i
said
upon
inquiry
i
found
that
the
place
was
two
miles
away
and
as
our
old
friend
simmons
was
still
on
the
i
jumped
into
his
cab
and
bade
him
drive
me
as
fast
as
he
could
to
no
bellringer
street
i
wanted
a
sense
of
motion
and
a
chance
of
scene
if
i
had
been
in
guernsey
i
should
have
mounted
madam
and
had
another
midnight
ride
round
the
island
this
was
a
poor
substitute
for
that
but
the
visit
would
serve
to
turn
my
thoughts
from
julia
if
any
one
in
london
could
do
the
man
good
i
believed
it
was
i
for
i
had
studied
that
one
malady
with
my
soul
thrown
into
it
we
turned
at
last
into
a
shabby
street
recognizable
even
in
the
twilight
of
the
scattered
lamps
as
being
a
place
for
cheap
there
was
a
light
burning
in
the
windows
of
no
but
all
the
rest
of
the
front
was
in
darkness
i
paid
simmons
and
dismissed
him
saying
i
would
walk
home
by
the
time
i
turned
to
knock
at
the
door
it
was
opened
quietly
from
within
a
woman
stood
in
the
doorway
i
could
not
see
her
face
for
the
candle
she
had
brought
with
her
was
on
the
table
behind
her
neither
was
there
light
enough
for
her
to
distinguish
mine
are
you
come
from
dr
lowry
she
asked
the
voice
sounded
a
familiar
one
but
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
recall
whose
it
was
yes
i
answered
but
i
do
not
know
the
name
of
my
patient
here
martin
dobrée
she
exclaimed
in
an
accent
almost
of
terror
i
recollected
her
then
as
the
person
who
had
been
in
search
of
olivia
she
had
fallen
back
a
few
paces
and
i
could
now
see
her
face
it
was
startled
and
doubtful
as
if
she
hesitated
to
admit
me
was
it
possible
i
had
come
to
attend
olivia
husband
i
do
know
whatever
to
do
she
ejaculated
he
is
very
ill
but
i
do
think
he
ought
to
see
i
do
think
he
would
listen
to
me
i
said
i
do
not
think
there
is
another
man
in
london
as
well
qualified
to
do
him
good
why
she
asked
eagerly
because
i
have
made
this
disease
my
special
study
i
answered
mind
i
am
not
anxious
to
attend
him
i
came
here
simply
because
my
friend
is
out
of
town
if
he
wishes
to
see
me
i
will
see
him
and
do
my
best
for
him
it
rests
entirely
with
himself
will
you
wait
here
a
few
minutes
she
asked
while
i
see
what
he
will
do
she
left
me
in
the
hall
pervaded
by
a
musty
smell
of
unventilated
rooms
and
a
damp
dirty
underground
floor
the
place
was
altogether
sordid
and
dingy
and
miserable
at
last
i
heard
her
step
coming
down
the
two
flights
of
stairs
and
i
went
to
meet
her
he
will
see
you
she
said
eying
me
herself
with
a
steady
gaze
of
curiosity
her
curiosity
was
not
greater
than
mine
i
was
anxious
to
see
husband
partly
from
the
intense
aversion
i
felt
instinctively
toward
him
he
was
lying
back
in
an
old
with
a
shawl
thrown
across
his
shoulders
for
the
night
was
chilly
his
face
had
the
first
sickly
hue
and
emaciation
of
the
disease
and
was
probably
refined
by
it
it
was
a
handsome
regular
face
narrow
across
the
brows
with
thin
firm
lips
and
eyes
perfect
in
shape
but
cold
and
glittering
as
steel
i
knew
afterward
that
he
was
fifteen
years
older
than
olivia
across
his
knees
lay
a
shaggy
cat
which
he
held
fast
by
the
and
from
time
to
time
entertained
himself
by
teasing
and
tormenting
it
he
scrutinized
me
as
keenly
as
i
did
him
i
believe
we
are
in
some
sort
connected
martin
dobrée
he
said
smiling
coldly
my
kate
daltrey
is
married
to
your
father
dr
dobrée
yes
i
answered
shortly
the
subject
was
eminently
disagreeable
to
me
and
i
had
no
wish
to
pursue
it
with
him
ay
she
will
make
him
a
happy
man
he
continued
mockingly
you
are
not
yourself
married
i
believe
martin
dobrée
i
took
no
notice
whatever
of
his
question
or
the
preceding
remark
but
passed
on
to
formal
inquiries
concerning
his
health
my
close
study
of
his
malady
helped
me
here
i
could
assist
him
to
describe
and
localize
his
symptoms
and
i
soon
discovered
that
the
disease
was
as
yet
in
a
very
early
stage
you
have
a
better
grip
of
it
than
lowry
he
said
sighing
with
satisfaction
i
feel
as
if
i
were
made
of
glass
and
you
could
look
through
me
can
you
cure
me
i
will
do
my
best
i
answered
so
you
all
say
he
muttered
and
the
best
is
generally
good
for
nothing
you
see
i
care
less
about
getting
over
it
than
my
wife
does
she
is
very
anxious
for
my
recovery
your
wife
i
repeated
in
utter
surprise
you
are
richard
foster
i
believe
certainly
he
replied
does
your
wife
know
of
your
present
illness
i
inquired
to
be
sure
he
answered
let
me
introduce
you
to
richard
foster
the
woman
looked
at
me
with
flashing
eyes
and
a
mocking
smile
while
foster
indulged
himself
with
extorting
a
long
and
plaintive
mew
from
the
poor
cat
on
his
knees
i
can
not
understand
i
said
i
did
not
know
how
to
continue
my
speech
though
they
might
choose
to
pass
as
husband
and
wife
among
strangers
they
could
hardly
expect
to
impose
upon
me
ah
i
see
you
do
not
said
foster
with
a
visible
sneer
olivia
is
dead
olivia
dead
i
exclaimed
i
repeated
the
words
mechanically
as
if
i
could
not
make
any
meaning
out
of
them
yet
they
had
been
spoken
with
such
perfect
deliberation
and
certainty
that
there
seemed
to
be
no
question
about
the
fact
foster
glittering
eyes
dwelt
delightedly
upon
my
face
you
were
not
aware
of
it
he
said
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
too
sudden
kate
tells
us
you
were
in
love
with
my
first
wife
and
sacrificed
a
most
eligible
match
for
her
would
it
be
too
late
to
open
fresh
negotiations
with
your
cousin
you
see
i
know
all
your
family
history
when
did
olivia
die
i
inquired
though
my
tongue
felt
dry
and
parched
and
the
room
with
his
fiendish
face
was
swimming
giddily
before
my
eyes
when
was
it
carry
he
asked
turning
to
his
wife
we
heard
she
was
dead
on
the
first
of
october
she
answered
you
married
me
the
next
day
ah
yes
he
said
olivia
had
been
dead
to
me
for
more
than
twelve
months
and
the
moment
i
was
free
i
married
her
martin
we
could
not
be
married
before
and
there
was
no
reason
to
wait
longer
it
was
quite
legal
but
what
proof
have
you
i
asked
still
incredulous
yet
with
a
heart
so
heavy
that
it
could
hardly
rouse
itself
to
hope
carry
have
you
those
letters
said
richard
foster
she
was
away
for
a
few
minutes
while
he
leaned
back
again
in
his
chair
regarding
nic
with
his
cruel
eyes
i
said
nothing
and
resolved
to
betray
no
emotion
olivia
dead
my
olivia
i
could
not
believe
it
here
are
the
proofs
said
foster
reentering
the
room
she
put
into
my
hand
an
ordinary
certificate
of
death
signed
by
jones
it
stated
that
the
deceased
olivia
foster
had
died
on
september
the
of
acute
inflammation
of
the
lungs
accompanying
this
was
a
letter
written
in
a
good
handwriting
purporting
to
be
from
a
clergyman
or
minister
of
what
denomination
it
was
not
stated
who
had
attended
olivia
in
her
fatal
illness
he
said
that
she
had
desired
him
to
keep
the
place
of
her
death
and
burial
a
secret
and
to
forward
no
more
than
the
official
certificate
of
the
former
event
this
letter
was
signed
jones
no
clew
was
given
by
either
document
as
to
the
place
where
they
were
written
are
you
not
satisfied
asked
foster
no
i
replied
how
is
it
if
olivia
is
dead
that
you
have
not
taken
possession
of
her
property
a
shrewd
question
he
said
jeeringly
why
am
i
in
these
cursed
poor
lodgings
why
am
i
as
poor
as
job
when
there
are
twenty
thousand
pounds
of
my
wife
estate
lying
unclaimed
my
sweet
angelic
olivia
left
no
will
or
none
in
my
favor
you
may
be
sure
and
by
her
father
will
if
she
dies
intestate
or
without
children
his
property
goes
to
build
almshouses
or
some
confounded
nonsense
in
melbourne
all
she
bequeaths
to
me
is
this
ring
which
i
gave
to
her
on
our
curse
her
he
held
out
his
hand
on
the
little
finger
of
which
shone
a
diamond
which
might
as
far
as
i
knew
be
the
one
i
had
once
seen
in
possession
perhaps
you
do
not
know
he
continued
that
it
was
on
this
very
point
the
making
of
her
will
or
securing
her
property
to
me
in
some
way
that
my
wife
took
offence
and
ran
away
from
me
carry
was
just
a
little
too
hard
upon
her
and
i
was
away
in
paris
but
consider
i
expected
to
be
left
penniless
just
as
you
see
me
left
and
carry
was
determined
to
prevent
it
then
you
are
sure
of
her
death
i
said
so
sure
he
replied
calmly
that
we
were
married
the
next
day
olivia
letter
to
me
as
well
as
those
papers
was
conclusive
of
her
identity
will
you
like
to
see
it
foster
gave
me
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
were
written
a
few
lines
the
words
looked
faint
and
grew
paler
as
i
read
them
they
were
without
doubt
olivia
writing
i
know
that
you
are
poor
and
i
send
you
all
i
can
spare
the
ring
you
once
gave
to
me
i
am
even
poorer
than
yourself
but
i
have
just
enough
for
my
last
necessities
i
forgive
you
as
i
trust
that
god
forgives
me
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
or
done
conviction
had
been
brought
home
to
me
i
rose
to
take
my
leave
and
foster
held
out
his
hand
to
me
perhaps
with
a
kindly
intention
olivia
ring
was
glittering
on
it
and
i
could
not
take
it
into
mine
well
well
he
said
i
understand
i
am
sorry
for
you
come
again
martin
dobrée
if
you
know
of
any
remedy
for
my
ease
you
are
no
true
man
if
you
do
not
try
it
i
went
down
the
narrow
staircase
closely
followed
by
foster
her
face
had
lost
its
gayety
and
boldness
and
looked
womanly
and
careworn
as
she
laid
her
hand
upon
my
arm
before
opening
the
for
god
sake
come
again
she
said
if
you
can
do
any
thing
for
him
we
have
money
left
yet
and
i
am
earning
more
every
day
we
can
pay
you
well
promise
me
you
will
come
again
i
can
promise
nothing
i
answered
you
shall
not
go
till
you
promise
she
said
emphatically
well
then
i
promise
i
answered
and
she
unfastened
the
chain
almost
noiselessly
and
opened
the
door
into
the
street
chapter
the
sad
sews
a
fine
drizzling
rain
was
falling
i
was
just
conscious
of
it
as
an
element
of
discomfort
but
it
did
not
make
me
quicken
my
steps
i
wanted
no
rapidity
of
motion
now
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
nothing
to
look
forward
to
nothing
to
flee
away
from
olivia
was
dead
i
had
said
the
same
thing
again
and
again
to
myself
that
olivia
was
dead
to
me
but
at
this
moment
i
learned
how
great
a
difference
there
was
between
the
words
as
a
figure
of
speech
and
as
a
terrible
reality
i
could
no
longer
think
of
her
as
treading
the
same
earth
the
same
streets
perhaps
speaking
the
same
language
seeing
the
same
daylight
as
myself
i
recalled
her
image
as
i
had
seen
her
last
in
sark
and
then
i
tried
to
picture
her
white
face
with
lips
and
eyes
closed
forever
and
the
awful
chill
of
death
resting
upon
her
it
seemed
impossible
yet
the
went
on
in
my
brain
olivia
is
dead
is
dead
i
reached
home
just
as
jack
was
coming
in
from
his
evening
amusement
he
let
me
in
with
his
giving
me
a
cheery
greeting
but
as
soon
as
we
had
entered
the
and
he
saw
my
face
he
exclaimed
good
heavens
martin
what
has
happened
to
you
olivia
is
dead
i
answered
his
arm
was
about
my
neck
in
a
moment
for
we
were
like
boys
together
still
when
we
were
alone
he
knew
all
about
olivia
and
he
waited
patiently
till
i
could
put
my
tidings
into
words
it
must
be
true
he
said
though
in
a
doubtful
tone
the
scoundrel
would
not
have
married
again
if
he
had
not
sufficient
proof
she
must
have
died
very
soon
after
my
mother
i
answered
and
i
never
knew
it
it
strange
he
said
i
wonder
she
never
got
anybody
to
write
to
you
or
tardif
there
was
no
way
of
accounting
for
that
strange
silence
toward
us
we
sat
talking
in
short
broken
sentences
while
jack
smoked
a
cigar
but
we
could
come
to
no
conclusion
about
it
it
was
late
when
we
parted
and
i
went
to
bed
but
not
to
sleep
for
as
soon
as
the
room
was
quite
dark
visions
of
olivia
haunted
me
phantasms
of
her
followed
one
another
rapidly
through
my
brain
she
had
died
so
said
the
certificate
of
inflammation
of
the
lungs
after
an
illness
of
ten
days
i
felt
myself
bound
to
go
through
every
stage
of
her
illness
dwelling
upon
all
her
sufferings
and
thinking
of
her
as
under
careless
or
unskilled
attendance
with
no
friend
at
hand
to
take
care
of
her
she
ought
not
to
have
died
with
her
perfect
constitution
if
i
had
been
there
she
should
not
have
died
about
four
jack
tapped
softly
upon
the
wall
between
our
bedrooms
it
was
a
signal
we
had
used
when
we
were
boys
as
though
to
inquire
if
i
was
all
right
but
it
was
quiet
enough
not
to
wake
me
if
i
were
asleep
it
seemed
like
the
friendly
ahoy
from
a
boat
floating
on
the
same
dark
sea
jack
was
lying
awake
thinking
of
me
as
i
was
thinking
of
olivia
there
was
something
so
consolatory
in
this
sympathy
that
i
fell
asleep
while
dwelling
upon
it
upon
going
downstairs
in
the
morning
i
found
that
jack
was
already
off
having
left
a
short
note
for
me
saving
he
would
visit
my
patients
that
day
i
had
scarcely
begun
breakfast
when
the
servant
announced
a
lady
and
as
the
lady
followed
close
upon
his
heels
i
saw
behind
his
shoulder
the
familiar
face
of
johanna
looking
extremely
grave
she
was
soon
seated
beside
me
watching
me
with
something
of
the
tender
wistful
gaze
of
my
mother
her
eyes
were
of
the
same
shape
and
color
and
i
could
hardly
command
myself
to
speak
calmly
your
friend
john
senior
called
upon
us
a
short
time
since
she
said
and
told
us
this
sad
sad
news
i
nodded
silently
if
we
had
only
known
it
yesterday
she
continued
you
would
never
have
heard
what
we
then
said
this
makes
so
vast
a
difference
julia
could
not
have
become
your
wife
while
there
was
another
woman
living
whom
you
loved
more
you
understand
her
feeling
yes
i
said
julia
is
right
my
brother
and
i
have
been
talking
about
the
change
this
will
make
she
resumed
he
would
not
rob
you
of
any
consolation
or
of
any
future
happiness
not
for
worlds
he
relinquishes
all
claim
to
or
hope
of
julia
affection
that
would
be
unjust
to
julia
i
interrupted
she
must
not
be
sacrificed
to
me
any
longer
i
do
not
suppose
i
shall
ever
marry
you
must
marry
martin
she
interrupted
in
her
turn
and
speaking
emphatically
you
are
altogether
unfitted
for
a
bachelor
life
it
is
all
very
well
for
john
senior
who
has
never
known
a
companionship
and
who
can
do
without
it
but
it
is
misery
to
you
this
cold
colorless
life
no
of
all
the
men
i
ever
knew
you
are
the
least
fitted
for
a
single
life
perhaps
i
am
i
admitted
as
i
recalled
my
longing
for
some
sign
of
womanhood
about
our
bachelor
dwelling
i
am
certain
of
it
she
said
now
but
for
our
precipitation
last
night
you
would
have
gone
naturally
to
julia
for
comfort
so
my
brother
sends
word
that
he
is
going
back
to
guernsey
leaving
us
in
hanover
street
where
we
are
close
to
you
we
have
said
nothing
to
julia
yet
she
is
crying
over
this
sad
news
mourning
for
your
sorrow
you
know
that
my
brother
has
not
spoken
directly
to
julia
of
his
love
and
now
all
that
is
in
the
past
and
is
to
be
as
if
it
had
never
been
and
we
go
on
exactly
as
if
we
had
not
had
that
conversation
yesterday
but
that
can
not
be
i
remonstrated
i
can
not
consent
to
julia
wasting
her
love
and
time
upon
me
i
assure
you
most
solemnly
i
shall
never
marry
my
cousin
now
you
love
her
said
johanna
certainly
i
answered
as
my
sister
better
than
any
woman
now
living
she
pursued
yes
i
replied
that
is
all
julia
requires
she
continued
so
let
us
say
no
more
at
present
martin
only
understand
that
all
idea
of
marriage
between
her
and
my
brother
is
quite
put
away
do
argue
with
me
do
contradict
me
come
to
see
us
as
you
would
have
done
but
for
that
unfortunate
conversation
last
night
all
will
come
right
but
captain
carey
i
began
there
not
a
word
she
interrupted
imperatively
tell
me
all
about
that
wretch
richard
foster
how
did
you
come
across
him
is
he
likely
to
die
is
he
any
thing
like
kate
daltrey
i
will
never
call
her
kate
dobrée
as
long
as
the
world
lasts
come
martin
tell
me
every
thing
about
him
she
sat
with
me
most
of
the
morning
talking
with
animated
perseverance
and
at
last
prevailed
upon
me
to
take
her
a
walk
in
hyde
park
her
pertinacity
did
me
good
in
spite
of
the
irritation
it
caused
me
when
her
was
at
hand
i
felt
bound
to
attend
her
to
her
house
in
hanover
street
and
i
could
not
get
away
from
her
without
first
speaking
to
julia
her
face
was
very
sorrowful
and
her
manner
sympathetic
we
said
only
a
few
words
to
one
another
but
i
went
away
with
the
impression
that
her
heart
was
still
with
me
chapter
the
fortieth
a
tormenting
doubt
at
dinner
jack
announced
his
intention
of
paying
a
visit
to
richard
foster
you
are
not
fit
to
deal
with
the
fellow
he
said
you
may
be
sharp
enough
upon
your
own
black
sheep
in
guernsey
but
you
know
nothing
of
the
breed
here
now
if
i
see
him
i
will
squeeze
out
of
him
every
mortal
thing
he
knows
about
olivia
where
did
those
papers
come
from
there
was
no
place
given
i
answered
but
there
would
be
a
on
the
envelop
he
replied
i
will
make
him
show
me
the
envelop
they
were
in
jack
i
said
you
do
not
suppose
he
has
any
doubt
of
her
death
i
ca
say
he
answered
you
see
he
has
married
again
and
if
she
were
not
dead
that
would
be
bigamy
an
ugly
sort
of
crime
but
are
you
sure
they
are
married
how
can
i
be
sure
i
asked
fretfully
for
grief
as
often
makes
men
fretful
as
illness
i
did
not
ask
for
their
well
well
i
will
go
he
answered
i
awaited
his
return
with
impatience
with
this
doubt
insinuated
by
jack
it
began
to
seem
almost
incredible
that
olivia
exquisitely
healthy
frame
should
have
succumbed
suddenly
under
a
malady
to
which
she
had
no
predisposition
whatever
moreover
her
original
soundness
of
constitution
had
been
strengthened
by
ten
months
residence
in
the
pure
bracing
air
of
sark
yet
what
was
i
to
think
in
face
of
those
undated
documents
and
of
her
own
short
letter
to
her
husband
the
one
i
knew
was
genuine
why
should
i
suppose
the
others
to
be
forged
and
if
forgeries
who
had
been
guilty
of
such
a
cruel
and
crafty
artifice
and
for
what
purpose
i
had
not
found
any
satisfactory
answer
to
these
queries
before
jack
returned
his
face
kindled
with
excitement
he
caught
my
hand
and
grasped
it
heartily
i
no
more
believe
she
is
dead
than
i
am
were
his
first
words
you
recollect
me
telling
you
of
a
drunken
brawl
in
a
street
off
the
strand
where
a
fellow
as
drunk
as
a
lord
was
for
claiming
a
pretty
girl
as
his
wife
only
i
had
followed
her
out
of
ridley
and
was
just
in
time
to
protect
her
from
him
a
girl
i
could
have
fallen
in
love
with
myself
you
recollect
yes
yes
i
said
almost
breathless
he
was
the
man
and
olivia
was
the
girl
exclaimed
jack
no
i
cried
yes
continued
jack
with
an
affectionate
lunge
at
me
at
any
rate
i
can
swear
he
is
the
man
and
i
would
bet
a
thousand
to
one
that
the
girl
was
olivia
but
when
was
it
i
asked
since
he
married
again
he
answered
they
were
married
on
the
of
october
and
this
was
early
in
november
i
had
gone
to
ridley
after
a
place
for
a
poor
fellow
as
an
assistant
to
a
druggist
and
i
saw
the
girl
distinctly
she
gave
the
name
of
ellen
martineau
those
letters
about
her
death
are
all
forgeries
olivia
is
not
i
said
i
know
her
handwriting
too
well
well
then
observed
jack
there
is
only
one
explanation
she
has
sent
them
herself
to
throw
foster
off
the
scent
she
thinks
she
will
be
safe
if
he
believes
her
dead
no
i
answered
hotly
she
would
never
have
done
such
a
thing
as
that
who
else
is
benefited
by
it
he
asked
gravely
it
does
not
put
foster
into
possession
of
any
of
her
property
or
that
would
have
been
a
motive
for
him
to
do
it
but
he
gains
nothing
by
it
and
he
is
so
convinced
of
her
death
that
he
has
married
a
second
wife
it
was
difficult
to
hit
upon
any
other
explanation
yet
i
could
not
credit
this
one
i
felt
firmly
convinced
that
olivia
could
not
be
guilty
of
an
artifice
so
cunning
i
was
deceived
in
her
indeed
if
she
would
descend
to
any
fraud
so
cruel
but
i
could
not
discuss
the
question
even
with
jack
senior
tardif
was
the
only
person
who
knew
olivia
well
enough
to
make
his
opinion
of
any
value
besides
my
mind
was
not
as
clear
as
jack
that
she
was
the
girl
he
had
seen
in
november
yet
the
doubt
of
her
death
was
full
of
hope
it
made
the
earth
more
habitable
and
life
more
endurable
what
can
i
do
now
i
said
speaking
aloud
though
i
was
thinking
to
myself
martin
he
replied
gravely
is
it
wisest
to
leave
the
matter
as
it
stands
if
you
find
olivia
what
then
she
is
as
much
separated
from
you
as
she
can
be
by
death
so
long
as
foster
lives
it
is
worse
than
useless
to
be
thinking
of
her
there
is
no
misery
like
that
of
hanging
about
a
woman
you
have
no
right
to
love
i
only
wish
to
satisfy
myself
that
she
is
alive
i
answered
just
think
of
it
jack
not
to
know
whether
she
is
living
or
dead
you
must
help
me
to
satisfy
myself
foster
has
got
the
only
valuable
thing
she
had
in
her
possession
and
if
she
is
living
she
may
be
in
absolute
want
i
can
not
be
contented
with
that
dread
on
my
mind
there
can
be
no
harm
in
my
taking
some
care
of
her
at
a
distance
this
mystery
would
be
intolerable
to
me
you
right
old
fellow
he
said
cordially
we
will
go
to
together
morning
we
were
there
soon
after
the
doors
were
open
there
were
not
many
clients
present
and
the
clerks
were
enjoying
a
slack
time
jack
had
recalled
to
his
mind
the
exact
date
of
his
former
visit
and
thus
the
sole
difficulty
was
overcome
the
clerk
found
the
name
of
ellen
martineau
entered
under
that
date
in
his
book
yes
he
said
miss
ellen
martineau
english
teacher
in
a
french
school
premium
to
be
paid
about
pounds
no
salary
reference
wilkinson
no
bellringer
street
no
bellringer
street
we
repeated
in
one
breath
yes
gentlemen
that
is
the
address
said
the
clerk
closing
the
book
shall
i
write
it
down
for
you
wilkinson
was
the
party
who
should
have
paid
our
commission
as
you
perceive
a
premium
was
required
instead
of
a
salary
given
we
feel
pretty
sure
the
young
lady
went
to
the
school
but
wilkinson
denies
it
and
it
is
not
worth
our
while
to
pursue
our
claim
in
law
can
you
describe
the
young
lady
i
inquired
well
no
we
have
such
hosts
of
young
ladies
here
but
she
was
pretty
decidedly
pretty
she
made
that
impression
upon
me
at
least
we
are
too
busy
to
take
particular
notice
but
i
should
know
her
again
if
she
came
in
i
think
she
would
have
been
here
again
before
this
if
she
had
not
got
that
engagement
do
you
know
where
the
school
is
i
asked
no
wilkinson
was
the
party
he
said
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
except
send
any
ladies
to
her
who
thought
it
worth
their
while
that
was
all
as
we
could
obtain
no
further
information
we
went
away
and
paced
up
and
down
the
tolerably
quiet
street
deep
in
consultation
that
we
should
have
need
for
great
caution
and
as
much
craftiness
as
we
both
possessed
in
pursuing
our
inquiries
at
no
bellringer
street
was
quite
evident
who
could
be
this
unknown
wilkinson
was
it
possible
that
she
might
prove
to
be
foster
herself
at
any
rate
it
would
not
do
for
either
of
us
to
present
ourselves
there
in
quest
of
miss
ellen
martineau
it
was
finally
settled
between
us
that
johanna
should
be
intrusted
with
the
diplomatic
enterprise
there
was
not
much
chance
that
foster
would
know
her
by
sight
though
she
had
been
in
guernsey
and
it
would
excite
less
notice
for
a
lady
to
be
inquiring
after
olivia
we
immediately
turned
our
steps
toward
hanover
street
where
we
found
her
and
julia
seated
at
some
in
their
sombre
julia
received
me
with
a
little
embarrassment
but
conquered
it
sufficiently
to
give
me
a
warm
pressure
of
the
hand
and
to
whisper
in
my
ear
that
johanna
had
told
her
every
thing
unluckily
johanna
herself
knew
nothing
of
our
discovery
the
night
before
i
kept
julia
hand
in
mine
and
looked
steadily
into
her
eyes
my
dear
julia
i
said
we
bring
strange
news
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
olivia
is
not
dead
but
that
something
underhand
is
going
on
which
we
can
not
yet
make
out
julia
face
grew
crimson
but
i
would
not
let
her
draw
her
hand
away
from
my
clasp
i
held
it
the
more
firmly
and
as
jack
was
busy
talking
to
johanna
i
continued
speaking
to
her
in
a
lowered
tone
my
dear
i
said
you
have
been
as
true
and
faithful
and
generous
a
friend
as
any
man
ever
had
but
this
must
not
go
on
for
your
own
sake
you
fancied
you
loved
me
because
every
one
about
us
wished
it
to
be
so
but
i
can
not
let
you
waste
your
life
on
me
speak
to
me
exactly
as
your
brother
do
you
believe
you
could
be
really
happy
with
captain
carey
arthur
is
so
good
she
murmured
and
he
is
so
fond
of
me
i
had
never
heard
her
call
him
arthur
before
the
elder
members
of
our
guernsey
circle
called
him
by
his
christian
name
but
to
us
younger
ones
he
had
always
been
captain
carey
julia
use
of
it
was
more
eloquent
than
many
phrases
she
had
grown
into
the
habit
of
calling
him
familiarly
by
it
then
julia
i
said
what
folly
it
would
be
for
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
to
a
false
notion
of
faithfulness
i
could
not
accept
such
a
sacrifice
think
no
more
of
me
or
my
happiness
but
my
poor
aunt
was
so
anxious
for
you
to
have
a
home
of
your
own
she
said
sobbing
and
i
do
love
you
dearly
now
you
will
never
marry
i
know
you
will
not
if
you
can
have
neither
olivia
nor
me
for
your
wife
very
likely
i
answered
trying
to
laugh
away
her
agitation
i
shall
be
in
love
with
two
married
women
instead
how
shocking
that
will
sound
in
guernsey
but
i
not
afraid
that
captain
carey
will
forbid
me
his
house
how
little
we
thought
exclaimed
julia
i
knew
very
well
what
her
mind
had
gone
back
to
the
days
when
she
and
i
and
my
mother
were
furnishing
and
settling
the
house
that
would
now
become
captain
carey
home
then
it
is
all
settled
i
said
and
i
shall
write
to
him
by
post
inviting
him
back
again
that
is
if
he
really
left
you
last
night
yes
she
replied
he
would
not
stay
a
day
longer
her
face
had
grown
calm
as
we
talked
together
a
scarcely
perceptible
smile
was
lurking
about
her
lips
as
if
she
rejoiced
that
her
suspense
was
over
there
was
something
very
like
a
pang
in
the
idea
of
some
one
else
filling
the
place
i
had
once
fully
occupied
in
her
heart
but
the
pain
was
unworthy
of
me
i
drove
it
away
by
throwing
myself
heart
and
soul
into
the
mystery
which
hung
over
the
fate
of
olivia
we
have
hit
upon
a
splendid
plan
said
jack
miss
carey
will
take
simmons
cab
to
bellringer
street
and
reach
the
house
about
the
same
time
as
i
visit
foster
that
is
for
me
to
be
at
hand
if
she
should
need
any
protection
you
know
i
shall
stay
with
foster
till
i
hear
the
cab
drive
off
again
and
it
will
wait
for
me
at
the
corner
of
dawson
street
then
we
will
come
direct
here
and
tell
you
every
thing
at
once
of
course
miss
dobrée
will
wish
to
hear
it
all
can
not
i
go
with
johanna
she
asked
no
i
said
hastily
it
is
very
probable
foster
knows
you
by
sight
though
she
is
less
likely
to
know
johanna
i
fancy
wilkinson
will
turn
out
to
be
foster
herself
yet
why
they
should
spirit
olivia
away
into
a
french
school
and
pretend
that
she
is
dead
i
can
not
see
nor
could
any
one
of
the
others
see
the
reason
but
as
the
morning
was
fast
waning
away
and
both
jack
and
i
were
busy
we
were
compelled
to
close
the
discussion
and
with
our
minds
preoccupied
to
a
frightful
extent
make
those
calls
upon
our
patients
which
were
supposed
to
be
in
each
case
full
of
anxious
and
particular
thought
for
the
ailments
we
were
attempting
to
alleviate
upon
meeting
again
for
a
few
minutes
at
luncheon
we
made
a
slight
change
in
our
plan
for
we
found
a
note
from
foster
awaiting
me
in
which
he
requested
me
to
visit
him
in
the
future
instead
of
john
senior
as
he
felt
more
confidence
in
my
knowledge
of
his
malady
chapter
the
martin
dobrée
pledge
i
followed
simmons
cab
up
bellringer
street
and
watched
johanna
alight
and
enter
the
house
the
door
was
scarcely
closed
upon
her
when
i
rang
and
asked
the
slatternly
drudge
of
a
servant
if
i
could
see
foster
she
asked
me
to
go
up
to
the
parlor
on
the
second
floor
and
i
went
alone
with
little
expectation
of
finding
foster
there
unless
johanna
was
there
also
in
which
case
i
was
to
appear
as
a
stranger
to
her
the
parlor
looked
poorer
and
shabbier
by
daylight
than
at
night
there
was
not
a
single
element
of
comfort
in
it
the
curtains
hung
in
rags
about
a
window
begrimed
with
soot
and
smoke
the
only
was
the
one
occupied
by
foster
who
himself
looked
as
shabby
and
worn
as
the
room
the
cuffs
and
collar
of
his
shirt
were
yellow
and
tattered
his
hair
hung
long
and
lank
and
his
skin
had
a
sallow
unwholesome
tint
the
diamond
ring
upon
his
finger
was
altogether
out
of
keeping
with
his
threadbare
coat
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
as
if
there
were
no
waistcoat
beneath
it
from
head
to
foot
he
looked
a
seedy
fellow
yet
still
preserving
some
lingering
traces
of
the
gentleman
this
was
olivia
husband
a
good
deal
to
my
surprise
i
saw
foster
seated
quietly
at
a
table
drawn
close
to
the
window
very
busily
writing
engrossing
as
i
could
see
for
some
miserable
pittance
a
page
she
must
have
had
some
considerable
practice
in
the
work
for
it
was
done
well
and
her
pen
ran
quickly
over
the
paper
a
second
chair
left
empty
opposite
to
her
showed
that
foster
had
been
engaged
at
the
same
task
before
he
heard
my
step
on
the
stairs
he
looked
weary
and
i
could
not
help
feeling
something
akin
to
pity
for
him
i
did
not
know
that
they
had
come
down
as
low
as
that
i
did
not
expect
you
to
come
before
night
he
said
testily
i
like
to
have
some
idea
when
my
medical
attendant
is
coming
i
was
obliged
to
come
now
i
answered
offering
no
other
apology
the
man
irritated
me
more
than
any
other
person
that
had
ever
come
across
me
there
was
something
perverse
and
splenetic
in
every
word
he
uttered
and
every
expression
upon
his
face
i
do
not
like
your
partner
he
said
do
send
him
again
he
knows
nothing
about
his
business
he
spoke
with
all
the
haughtiness
of
a
millionnaire
to
a
country
practitioner
i
could
hardly
refrain
from
smiling
as
i
thought
of
disgust
and
indignation
as
for
that
i
replied
most
probably
neither
of
us
will
visit
you
again
lowry
will
return
and
you
will
be
in
his
hands
once
more
no
he
cried
with
a
passionate
urgency
in
his
tone
no
martin
dobrée
you
said
if
any
man
in
london
could
cure
me
it
was
yourself
i
can
not
leave
myself
in
any
other
hands
i
demand
from
you
the
fulfilment
of
your
words
if
what
you
said
is
true
you
can
no
more
leave
me
to
the
care
of
another
physician
than
you
could
leave
a
to
drown
without
doing
your
utmost
to
save
him
i
refuse
to
be
given
up
to
dr
lowry
but
it
is
by
no
means
a
parallel
ease
i
argued
you
were
under
his
treatment
before
and
i
have
no
reason
whatever
to
doubt
his
skill
why
should
you
feel
safer
in
my
hands
than
in
his
well
he
said
with
a
sneer
if
olivia
were
alive
i
dare
scarcely
have
trusted
you
could
i
but
you
have
nothing
to
gain
by
my
death
you
know
and
i
have
so
much
faith
in
you
in
your
skill
and
your
honor
and
your
conscientiousness
if
there
be
any
such
qualities
in
the
world
that
i
place
myself
unfalteringly
under
your
professional
care
shake
hands
upon
it
martin
dobrée
in
spite
of
my
repugnance
i
could
not
resist
taking
his
offered
hand
his
eyes
were
fastened
upon
me
with
something
of
the
fabled
fascination
of
a
serpent
i
knew
instinctively
that
he
would
have
the
power
and
use
it
of
probing
every
wound
he
might
suspect
in
me
to
the
quick
yet
he
interested
me
and
there
was
something
not
entirely
repellent
to
me
about
him
above
all
for
olivia
sake
should
we
find
her
still
living
i
was
anxious
to
study
his
character
it
might
happen
as
it
does
sometimes
that
my
honor
and
might
prove
a
match
for
his
crafty
shrewdness
there
he
said
exultantly
martin
dobrée
pledges
himself
to
cure
carry
you
are
the
witness
of
it
if
i
die
he
has
been
my
assassin
as
surely
as
if
he
had
plunged
a
stiletto
into
me
nonsense
i
answered
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
heal
or
destroy
i
simply
pledge
myself
to
use
every
means
i
know
of
for
your
recovery
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
he
replied
for
mark
you
i
will
be
the
most
careful
patient
you
ever
had
there
should
be
no
chance
for
you
even
if
olivia
were
alive
always
harping
on
that
one
string
was
it
nothing
more
than
a
lore
of
torturing
some
one
that
made
him
reiterate
those
words
or
did
he
wish
to
drive
home
more
deeply
the
conviction
that
she
was
indeed
dead
have
you
communicated
the
intelligence
of
her
death
to
her
trustee
in
australia
i
asked
no
why
should
i
he
said
no
good
would
come
of
it
to
me
why
should
i
trouble
myself
about
it
nor
to
your
i
added
to
mrs
dobrée
he
rejoined
no
it
does
not
signify
a
straw
to
her
either
she
holds
herself
aloof
from
me
now
confound
her
you
are
not
on
very
good
terms
with
her
yourself
i
believe
the
cab
was
still
standing
at
the
door
and
i
could
not
leave
before
it
drove
away
or
i
should
have
made
my
visit
a
short
one
foster
was
glancing
through
the
window
from
time
to
time
evidently
on
the
watch
to
see
the
visitor
depart
would
she
recognize
johanna
she
had
stayed
some
weeks
in
guernsey
and
johanna
was
a
fine
woman
noticeable
among
strangers
i
must
do
something
to
get
her
away
from
her
post
of
observation
foster
i
said
and
her
eyes
sparkled
at
the
sound
of
her
name
i
should
be
exceedingly
obliged
to
you
if
you
will
give
me
another
sight
of
those
papers
you
showed
to
me
the
last
time
i
was
here
she
was
away
for
a
few
minutes
and
i
heard
the
cab
drive
off
before
she
returned
that
was
the
chief
point
gained
when
the
papers
were
in
my
hand
i
just
glanced
at
them
and
that
was
all
have
you
any
idea
where
they
came
from
i
asked
there
is
the
london
on
the
envelop
answered
show
it
to
him
carry
there
is
nothing
to
be
learned
from
that
no
i
said
comparing
the
handwriting
on
the
envelop
with
the
letter
and
finding
them
the
same
well
i
can
not
often
pay
you
as
long
a
visit
as
this
i
hurried
off
quickly
to
the
corner
of
dawson
street
where
johanna
was
waiting
for
me
she
looked
exceedingly
contented
when
i
took
my
seat
beside
her
in
the
cab
well
martin
she
said
you
need
suffer
no
more
anxiety
olivia
has
gone
as
english
teacher
in
an
excellent
french
school
where
the
lady
is
thoroughly
acquainted
with
english
ways
and
comforts
this
is
the
prospectus
of
the
establishment
you
see
there
are
grounds
for
recreation
and
the
comforts
of
a
cheerfully
happy
home
the
domestic
arrangements
being
on
a
thoroughly
liberal
scale
here
is
also
a
photographic
view
of
the
place
a
charming
villa
you
see
in
the
best
french
style
the
lady
husband
is
an
and
every
thing
is
taught
by
professors
cosmography
and
pedagogy
and
other
studies
of
which
we
never
heard
when
i
was
a
girl
olivia
is
to
stay
there
twelve
months
and
in
return
for
her
services
will
take
lessons
from
any
professors
attending
the
establishment
your
mind
may
be
quite
at
ease
now
but
where
is
the
place
i
inquired
oh
it
is
in
normandy
noireau
she
said
quite
out
of
the
range
of
railways
and
tourists
there
will
be
no
danger
of
any
one
finding
her
out
there
and
you
know
she
has
changed
her
name
altogether
this
time
did
you
discover
that
olivia
and
ellen
martineau
are
the
same
persons
i
asked
an
expression
of
bewilderment
and
consternation
came
across
her
contented
face
no
i
did
not
she
answered
i
thought
you
were
sure
of
that
but
i
was
not
sure
of
it
neither
could
jack
be
sure
he
puzzled
himself
in
trying
to
give
a
satisfactory
description
of
his
ellen
martineau
but
every
answer
he
gave
to
my
eager
questions
plunged
us
into
greater
uncertainty
he
was
not
sure
of
the
color
either
of
her
hair
or
eyes
and
made
blundering
guesses
at
her
height
the
chief
proof
we
had
of
olivia
identity
was
the
drunken
claim
made
upon
ellen
martineau
by
foster
a
month
after
he
had
received
convincing
proof
that
she
was
dead
what
was
i
to
believe
it
was
running
too
great
a
risk
to
make
any
further
inquiries
at
no
bellringer
street
wilkinson
was
the
landlady
of
the
and
she
had
told
johanna
that
madame
perrier
boarded
with
her
when
she
was
in
london
but
she
might
begin
to
talk
to
her
other
lodgers
if
her
own
curiosity
were
excited
and
once
more
my
desire
to
fathom
the
mystery
hanging
about
olivia
might
plunge
her
into
fresh
difficulties
should
they
reach
the
ears
of
foster
or
his
wife
i
must
satisfy
myself
about
her
safety
now
i
said
only
put
yourself
in
my
place
jack
how
can
i
rest
till
i
know
more
about
olivia
i
do
put
myself
in
your
place
he
answered
what
do
you
say
to
having
a
run
down
to
this
place
in
and
seeing
for
yourself
whether
miss
ellen
martineau
is
your
olivia
how
can
i
i
asked
attempting
to
hang
back
from
the
suggestion
it
was
a
busy
time
with
us
the
season
was
in
full
roll
and
our
most
aristocratic
patients
were
in
town
the
easterly
winds
were
bringing
in
their
usual
harvest
of
bronchitis
and
diphtheria
if
i
went
hands
would
be
more
than
full
had
these
things
come
to
perplex
us
only
two
months
earlier
i
could
have
taken
a
holiday
with
a
clear
conscience
dad
will
jump
at
the
chance
of
coming
back
for
a
week
replied
jack
he
is
bored
to
death
down
at
fulham
go
you
must
for
my
sake
old
fellow
you
are
good
for
nothing
as
long
as
you
so
down
in
the
mouth
i
shall
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
you
we
shook
hands
upon
that
as
warmly
as
if
he
had
paid
me
the
most
flattering
compliments
chapter
the
noireau
in
this
way
it
came
to
pass
that
two
evenings
later
i
was
crossing
the
channel
to
havre
and
found
myself
about
five
in
the
afternoon
of
the
next
day
at
falaise
it
was
the
terminus
of
the
railway
in
that
direction
and
a
very
ancient
conveyance
bearing
the
name
of
la
petite
vitesse
was
in
waiting
to
carry
on
any
travellers
who
were
venturesome
enough
to
explore
the
regions
beyond
there
was
space
inside
for
six
passengers
but
it
smelt
too
musty
and
was
too
full
of
the
fumes
of
bad
tobacco
for
me
and
i
very
much
preferred
sitting
beside
the
driver
a
norman
habited
in
a
blue
blouse
who
could
crack
his
long
whip
with
almost
the
skill
of
a
parisian
we
were
friends
in
a
trice
for
my
was
almost
identical
with
his
own
and
he
could
not
believe
his
own
ears
that
he
was
talking
with
an
englishman
la
petite
vitesse
bore
out
its
name
admirably
if
it
were
meant
to
indicate
exceeding
slowness
we
never
advanced
beyond
a
slow
trot
and
at
the
slightest
hint
of
rising
ground
the
trot
slackened
into
a
walk
and
eventually
subsided
into
a
crawl
by
these
means
the
distance
we
traversed
was
made
to
seem
tremendous
and
the
drowsy
jingle
of
the
intimating
that
progress
was
being
accomplished
added
to
the
delusion
but
the
fresh
sweet
air
blowing
over
leagues
of
fields
and
meadows
untainted
with
a
breath
of
smoke
gave
me
a
delicious
tingling
in
the
veins
i
had
not
felt
such
a
glow
of
exhilaration
since
that
bright
morning
when
i
bad
crossed
the
channel
to
sark
to
ask
olivia
to
become
mine
the
sun
sank
below
the
distant
horizon
with
the
trees
showing
clearly
against
it
for
the
atmosphere
was
as
transparent
as
crystal
and
the
light
of
the
stars
that
came
out
one
by
one
almost
cast
a
defined
shadow
upon
our
path
from
the
standing
in
long
straight
rows
in
the
hedges
if
i
found
olivia
at
the
end
of
that
starlit
path
my
gladness
in
it
would
be
completed
yet
if
i
found
her
what
then
i
should
see
her
for
a
few
minutes
in
the
dull
of
a
school
perhaps
with
some
watchful
spying
frenchwoman
present
i
should
simply
satisfy
myself
that
she
was
living
there
could
be
nothing
more
between
us
i
dare
not
tell
her
how
dear
she
was
to
me
or
ask
her
if
she
ever
thought
of
me
in
her
loneliness
and
friendlessness
i
began
to
wish
that
i
had
brought
johanna
with
me
who
could
have
taken
her
in
her
arms
and
kissed
and
comforted
her
why
had
i
not
thought
of
that
before
as
we
proceeded
at
our
delusive
pace
along
the
last
stage
of
our
journey
i
began
to
sound
the
driver
cautiously
wheeling
about
the
object
of
my
excursion
into
those
remote
regions
i
had
tramped
through
normandy
and
brittany
three
or
four
times
but
there
had
been
no
inducement
to
visit
noireau
which
resembled
a
lancashire
and
i
had
never
been
there
there
are
not
many
english
at
noireau
i
remarked
suggestively
not
one
he
replied
not
one
at
this
moment
there
was
one
little
english
peste
a
very
pretty
little
english
girl
who
was
voyaging
precisely
like
you
some
months
ago
there
was
a
little
child
with
her
and
the
two
were
quite
alone
they
are
very
intrepid
are
the
english
she
did
not
know
a
word
of
our
language
but
that
was
droll
a
french
demoiselle
would
never
voyage
like
that
the
little
child
puzzled
me
yet
i
could
not
help
fancying
that
this
young
englishwoman
travelling
alone
with
no
knowledge
of
french
must
be
my
olivia
at
any
rate
it
could
be
no
other
than
miss
ellen
martineau
where
was
she
going
to
i
asked
she
came
to
noireau
to
be
an
instructress
in
an
establishment
answered
the
driver
in
a
tone
of
great
enjoyment
an
establishment
founded
by
the
wife
of
monsieur
emile
perrier
the
avocat
he
he
he
mon
dieu
how
droll
that
was
an
avocat
so
they
believed
that
in
england
bah
emile
perrier
an
avocat
mon
dieu
but
what
is
there
to
laugh
at
i
asked
as
the
man
laughter
rang
through
the
quiet
night
am
i
an
avocat
he
inquired
derisively
am
i
a
proprietor
am
i
even
a
curé
pardon
but
i
am
just
as
much
avocat
proprietor
curé
as
emile
perrier
he
was
an
impostor
he
became
bankrupt
he
and
his
wife
ran
away
to
save
themselves
the
establishment
was
broken
up
it
was
a
bubble
and
it
burst
comme
ça
my
driver
clapped
his
hands
together
lightly
as
though
monsieur
perrier
bubble
needed
very
little
pressure
to
disperse
it
good
heavens
i
exclaimed
but
what
became
of
oli
of
the
young
english
lady
and
the
child
ah
he
said
i
do
not
know
i
do
not
live
in
noireau
but
i
pass
to
and
fro
from
falaise
in
la
petite
vitesse
she
has
not
returned
in
my
omnibus
that
is
all
i
know
but
she
could
go
to
granville
or
to
caen
there
are
other
omnibuses
you
see
somebody
will
tell
you
down
there
for
three
or
four
miles
before
us
there
lay
a
road
as
straight
as
a
rule
ending
in
a
small
cluster
of
lights
glimmering
in
the
bottom
of
a
valley
into
which
we
were
descending
with
great
precaution
on
the
part
of
the
driver
and
his
team
that
was
noireau
but
already
my
exhilaration
was
exchanged
for
profound
anxiety
i
extorted
from
the
norman
all
the
information
he
possessed
concerning
the
bankrupt
it
was
not
much
and
it
only
served
to
heighten
my
solicitude
it
was
nearly
eleven
before
we
entered
the
town
but
i
learned
a
few
more
particulars
from
the
woman
in
the
omnibus
bureau
she
recollected
the
name
of
miss
ellen
martineau
and
her
arrival
and
she
described
her
with
the
accuracy
and
faithfulness
of
a
woman
if
she
were
not
olivia
herself
she
must
be
her
very
counterpart
but
who
was
the
child
a
girl
of
nine
or
ten
years
of
age
who
had
accompanied
her
it
was
too
late
to
learn
any
more
about
them
the
landlady
of
the
hotel
confirmed
all
i
had
heard
and
added
several
items
of
information
monsieur
perrier
and
his
wife
had
imposed
upon
several
english
families
and
had
succeeded
in
getting
dozens
of
english
pupils
so
she
assured
me
who
had
been
scattered
over
the
country
heaven
only
knew
where
when
the
school
was
broken
up
about
a
month
ago
i
started
out
early
the
next
morning
to
find
the
rue
de
grâce
where
the
inscription
on
my
photographic
view
of
the
premises
represented
them
as
situated
the
town
was
in
the
condition
of
a
provincial
town
in
england
about
a
century
ago
the
streets
were
as
dirty
as
the
total
absence
of
drains
and
scavengers
could
make
them
and
the
cleanest
path
was
up
the
kennel
in
the
centre
the
filth
of
the
houses
was
washed
down
into
them
by
pipes
with
little
cisterns
at
each
story
and
under
almost
every
window
there
were
many
improprieties
and
some
indecencies
shocking
to
english
sensibilities
in
the
rue
de
grâce
i
saw
two
nuns
in
their
hoods
and
veils
unloading
a
cart
full
of
manure
a
ladies
school
for
english
people
in
a
town
like
this
seemed
ridiculous
there
was
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
houses
in
my
photographic
view
there
were
two
of
them
one
standing
in
the
street
the
other
lying
back
beyond
a
very
pleasant
garden
a
frenchman
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
broad
which
connected
them
smoking
a
cigar
and
examining
critically
the
vines
growing
against
the
walls
two
little
children
were
gambolling
about
in
close
white
caps
and
with
frocks
down
to
their
heels
upon
seeing
me
he
took
his
cigar
from
his
lips
with
two
fingers
of
one
hand
and
lifted
his
hat
with
the
other
i
returned
the
salutation
with
a
politeness
as
ceremonious
as
his
own
monsieur
is
an
englishman
he
said
in
a
doubtful
tone
from
the
channel
islands
i
replied
ah
you
belong
to
us
he
said
but
you
are
hybrid
half
english
half
french
a
fine
race
i
also
have
english
blood
in
my
veins
i
paid
monsieur
a
compliment
upon
the
result
of
the
admixture
of
blood
in
his
own
instance
and
then
proceeded
to
unfold
my
object
in
visiting
him
ah
he
said
yes
yes
yes
perrier
was
an
impostor
these
houses
are
mine
monsieur
i
live
in
the
front
yonder
my
daughter
and
occupy
the
other
we
had
the
photographs
taken
for
our
own
pleasure
but
perrier
must
have
bought
them
from
the
artist
no
doubt
i
have
a
small
cottage
at
the
back
of
my
house
voilà
monsieur
there
it
is
perrier
rented
it
from
me
for
two
hundred
francs
a
year
i
permitted
him
to
pass
along
this
walk
and
through
our
into
a
passage
which
leads
to
the
street
where
madame
had
her
school
permit
me
and
i
will
show
it
to
you
he
led
me
through
a
shed
and
along
a
dirty
vaulted
passage
into
a
mean
street
at
the
back
a
small
house
stood
in
it
shut
up
with
broken
covering
the
windows
my
heart
sank
at
the
idea
of
olivia
living
here
in
such
discomfort
and
neglect
and
sordid
poverty
did
you
ever
see
a
young
english
lady
here
monsieur
i
asked
she
arrived
about
the
beginning
of
last
november
but
yes
certainly
monsieur
he
replied
a
charming
english
demoiselle
one
must
have
been
blind
not
to
observe
her
a
face
sweet
and
with
hair
of
gold
but
a
little
more
sombre
yes
yes
the
ladies
might
not
admire
her
but
we
others
he
laughed
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
a
detestable
manner
what
height
was
she
monsieur
i
inquired
a
just
height
he
answered
not
tall
like
a
camel
nor
too
short
like
a
monkey
she
would
stand
an
inch
or
two
above
your
shoulder
monsieur
it
could
be
no
other
than
my
olivia
she
had
been
living
here
then
in
this
miserable
place
only
a
month
ago
but
where
could
she
be
now
how
was
i
to
find
any
trace
of
her
i
will
make
some
inquiries
from
my
daughter
said
the
frenchman
when
the
establishment
was
broken
up
i
was
ill
with
the
fever
monsieur
we
have
fever
often
here
but
she
will
know
i
will
ask
her
he
returned
to
me
after
some
time
with
the
information
that
the
english
demoiselle
had
been
seen
in
the
house
of
a
woman
who
sold
milk
mademoiselle
rosalie
by
name
and
he
volunteered
to
accompany
me
to
her
dwelling
it
was
a
house
of
one
room
only
in
the
same
street
as
the
school
but
we
found
no
one
there
except
an
old
woman
exceedingly
deaf
who
told
us
after
much
difficulty
in
making
her
understand
our
object
that
mademoiselle
rosalie
was
gone
somewhere
to
nurse
a
relative
who
was
dangerously
she
had
not
had
any
cows
of
her
own
and
she
had
easily
disposed
of
her
small
business
to
this
old
woman
and
her
daughter
did
the
messieurs
want
any
milk
for
their
families
no
well
then
she
could
not
tell
us
any
thing
more
about
rosalie
and
she
knew
nothing
of
an
englishwoman
and
a
little
girl
i
turned
away
baffled
and
discouraged
but
my
new
friend
was
not
so
quickly
depressed
it
was
impossible
he
maintained
that
the
english
girl
and
the
child
could
have
left
the
town
unnoticed
he
went
with
me
to
all
the
omnibus
bureaus
where
we
made
urgent
inquiries
concerning
the
passengers
who
had
quitted
noireau
during
the
last
month
no
places
had
been
taken
for
miss
ellen
martineau
and
the
child
for
there
was
no
such
name
in
any
of
the
books
but
at
each
bureau
i
was
recommended
to
see
the
drivers
upon
their
return
in
the
evening
and
i
was
compelled
to
give
up
the
pursuit
for
that
day
chapter
the
a
second
pursuer
no
wonder
there
was
fever
in
the
town
i
thought
as
i
picked
my
way
among
the
heaps
of
garbage
and
refuse
lying
out
in
the
streets
the
most
hideous
old
women
i
ever
saw
wrinkled
over
every
inch
of
their
skin
and
with
eyelids
reddened
by
smoke
met
me
at
each
turn
sallow
weavers
in
white
caps
gazed
out
at
me
from
their
looms
in
almost
every
house
there
was
scarcely
a
child
to
be
seen
about
the
whole
district
undrained
and
unhealthy
bears
the
name
of
the
manufactory
of
little
angels
from
the
number
of
children
who
die
there
and
this
was
the
place
where
olivia
had
been
spending
a
very
hard
and
severe
winter
there
was
going
to
be
a
large
the
next
day
and
all
the
town
was
alive
every
inn
in
the
place
was
crowded
to
overflowing
as
i
sat
at
the
window
of
my
watching
the
picturesque
groups
which
formed
in
the
street
outside
i
heard
a
vehement
altercation
going
on
in
the
archway
under
which
was
the
entrance
to
my
hotel
grands
dieux
cried
the
already
familiar
voice
of
my
landlady
shrill
as
the
cackling
of
a
hen
grands
dieux
not
a
single
soul
from
can
rest
here
neither
man
nor
woman
they
have
the
fever
like
a
pest
there
no
no
that
is
impossible
go
away
you
and
your
beast
there
is
room
at
the
lion
but
the
gensdarmes
should
not
let
you
enter
the
town
we
have
fever
enough
of
our
own
but
my
farm
is
a
league
from
was
the
answer
in
the
slow
rugged
accents
of
a
norman
peasant
but
i
tell
you
it
is
impossible
she
retorted
i
have
an
englishman
here
very
rich
a
milor
and
he
will
not
hear
of
any
person
from
resting
in
the
house
go
away
to
the
lion
my
good
friend
where
there
are
no
english
they
are
as
afraid
of
the
fever
as
of
the
devil
i
laughed
to
myself
at
my
landlady
ingenious
excuses
but
after
this
the
conversation
fell
into
a
lower
key
and
i
heard
no
more
of
it
i
went
out
late
in
the
evening
to
question
each
of
the
omnibus
drivers
but
in
vain
whether
they
were
too
busy
to
give
me
proper
attention
or
too
anxious
to
join
the
stir
and
mirth
of
the
townspeople
they
all
declared
they
knew
nothing
of
any
englishwoman
as
i
returned
dejectedly
to
my
inn
i
heard
a
lamentable
voice
evidently
english
bemoaning
in
doubtful
french
the
omnibus
from
falaise
had
just
come
in
and
under
the
lamp
in
the
entrance
of
the
archway
stood
a
lady
before
my
hostess
who
was
volubly
asserting
that
there
was
no
room
left
in
her
house
i
hastened
to
the
assistance
of
my
countrywoman
and
the
light
of
the
lamp
falling
full
upon
her
face
revealed
to
me
who
she
was
mrs
foster
i
exclaimed
almost
shouting
her
name
in
my
astonishment
she
looked
ready
to
faint
with
fatigue
and
dismay
and
she
laid
her
hand
heavily
on
my
arm
as
if
to
save
herself
from
sinking
to
the
ground
have
you
found
her
she
asked
involuntarily
not
a
trace
of
her
i
answered
foster
broke
into
an
hysterical
laugh
which
was
very
quickly
followed
by
sobs
i
had
no
great
difficulty
in
persuading
the
landlady
to
find
some
accommodation
for
her
and
then
i
retired
to
my
own
room
to
smoke
in
peace
and
turn
over
the
extraordinary
meeting
which
had
been
the
last
incident
of
the
day
it
required
very
little
keenness
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
fosters
had
obtained
their
information
concerning
miss
ellen
martineau
where
we
had
got
ours
from
wilkinson
also
that
foster
had
lost
no
time
in
following
up
the
clew
for
she
was
only
hours
behind
me
she
had
looked
thoroughly
astonished
and
dismayed
when
she
saw
me
there
so
she
had
had
no
idea
that
i
was
on
the
same
track
but
nothing
could
be
more
convincing
than
this
journey
of
hers
that
neither
she
nor
foster
really
believed
in
olivia
death
that
was
as
clear
as
day
but
what
explanation
could
i
give
to
myself
of
those
letters
of
olivia
above
all
was
it
possible
that
she
had
caused
them
to
be
written
and
sent
to
her
husband
i
could
not
even
admit
such
a
question
without
a
sharp
sense
of
disappointment
in
her
i
saw
foster
early
in
the
morning
somewhat
as
a
may
meet
another
on
neutral
ground
she
was
grateful
to
me
for
my
interposition
in
her
behalf
the
night
before
and
as
i
knew
ellen
martineau
to
be
safely
out
of
the
way
i
was
inclined
to
be
tolerant
toward
her
i
assured
her
upon
my
honor
that
i
had
failed
in
discovering
any
trace
of
olivia
in
noireau
and
i
told
her
all
i
had
learned
about
the
bankruptcy
of
monsieur
perrier
and
the
scattering
of
the
school
but
why
should
you
undertake
such
a
chase
i
asked
if
you
and
foster
are
satisfied
that
olivia
is
dead
why
should
you
be
running
after
ellen
martineau
you
show
me
the
papers
which
seem
to
prove
her
death
and
now
i
find
you
in
this
remote
part
of
normandy
evidently
in
pursuit
of
her
what
does
this
mean
you
are
doing
the
same
thing
yourself
she
answered
yes
i
replied
because
i
am
not
satisfied
but
you
have
proved
your
conviction
by
becoming
richard
foster
second
wife
that
is
the
very
point
she
said
shedding
a
few
tears
as
soon
as
ever
wilkinson
described
ellen
martineau
to
me
when
she
was
talking
about
her
visitor
who
had
come
to
inquire
after
her
in
that
cab
which
was
standing
at
the
door
the
last
time
you
visited
foster
and
i
had
no
suspicion
of
it
i
grew
quite
frightened
lest
he
should
ever
be
charged
with
marrying
me
while
she
was
alive
so
i
persuaded
him
to
let
me
come
here
and
make
sure
of
it
though
the
journey
costs
a
great
deal
and
we
have
very
little
money
to
spare
we
did
not
know
what
tricks
olivia
might
do
and
it
made
me
very
miserable
to
think
she
might
be
still
alive
and
i
in
her
place
i
could
not
but
acknowledge
to
myself
that
there
was
some
reason
in
foster
statement
of
the
case
there
is
not
the
slightest
chance
of
your
finding
her
i
remarked
is
there
she
asked
with
an
evil
gleam
in
her
eyes
which
i
just
caught
before
she
hid
her
face
again
in
her
handkerchief
at
any
rate
i
said
you
would
have
no
power
over
her
if
you
found
her
you
could
not
take
her
back
with
you
by
force
i
do
not
know
how
the
french
laws
would
regard
foster
authority
but
you
can
have
none
whatever
and
he
is
quite
unfit
to
take
this
long
journey
to
claim
her
really
i
do
not
see
what
you
can
do
and
i
should
think
your
wisest
plan
would
be
to
go
back
and
take
care
of
him
leaving
her
alone
i
am
here
to
protect
her
and
i
shall
stay
until
i
see
you
fairly
out
of
the
place
she
did
not
speak
again
for
some
minutes
but
she
was
evidently
reflecting
upon
what
i
had
just
said
but
what
are
we
to
live
upon
she
asked
at
last
there
is
her
money
lying
in
the
bank
and
neither
she
nor
richard
can
touch
it
it
must
be
paid
to
her
personally
or
to
her
order
and
she
can
not
prove
her
identity
herself
without
the
papers
richard
holds
it
is
aggravating
i
am
at
my
wits
end
about
it
listen
to
me
i
said
why
can
not
we
come
to
some
arrangement
supposing
ellen
martineau
proves
to
be
olivia
it
would
be
better
for
you
all
to
make
some
division
of
her
property
by
mutual
agreement
you
know
best
whether
olivia
could
insist
upon
a
judicial
separation
but
in
any
other
case
why
should
not
foster
agree
to
receive
half
her
income
and
leave
her
free
as
free
as
she
can
be
with
the
other
half
surely
some
mutual
agreement
could
be
made
he
would
never
do
it
she
exclaimed
clasping
her
hands
round
her
knees
and
swaying
to
and
fro
passionately
he
never
loses
any
power
she
belongs
to
him
and
he
never
gives
up
any
thing
he
would
torment
her
almost
to
death
but
he
would
never
let
her
go
free
no
no
you
do
not
know
him
dr
martin
then
we
will
try
to
get
a
divorce
i
said
looking
at
her
steadily
on
what
grounds
she
asked
looking
at
me
as
steadily
i
could
not
and
would
not
enter
into
the
question
with
her
there
has
been
no
personal
cruelty
on
richard
part
toward
her
she
resumed
with
a
it
true
i
locked
her
up
for
a
few
days
once
but
he
was
in
paris
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
you
could
not
prove
a
single
act
of
cruelty
toward
her
still
i
did
not
answer
though
she
paused
and
regarded
me
keenly
we
were
not
married
till
we
had
reason
to
believe
her
dead
she
continued
there
is
no
harm
in
that
if
she
has
forged
those
papers
she
is
to
blame
we
were
married
openly
in
our
parish
church
what
could
be
said
against
that
let
us
return
to
what
i
told
you
at
first
i
said
if
you
find
olivia
you
have
no
more
authority
over
her
than
i
have
you
will
be
obliged
to
return
to
england
alone
and
i
shall
place
her
in
some
safe
custody
i
shall
ascertain
precisely
how
the
law
stands
both
here
and
in
england
now
i
advise
you
for
foster
sake
make
as
much
haste
home
as
you
can
for
he
will
be
left
without
nurse
or
doctor
while
we
two
are
away
she
sat
gnawing
her
under
lip
for
some
minutes
and
looking
as
vicious
as
madam
was
wont
to
do
in
her
worst
tempers
you
will
let
me
make
some
inquiries
to
satisfy
myself
she
said
certainly
i
replied
you
will
only
discover
as
i
have
that
the
school
was
broken
up
a
month
ago
and
ellen
martineau
has
disappeared
i
kept
no
very
strict
watch
over
her
during
the
day
for
i
felt
sure
she
would
find
no
trace
of
olivia
in
noireau
at
night
i
saw
her
again
she
was
worn
out
and
despondent
and
declared
herself
quite
ready
to
return
to
falaise
by
the
omnibus
at
five
in
the
morning
i
saw
her
off
and
gave
the
driver
a
fee
to
bring
me
word
for
what
town
she
took
her
ticket
at
the
when
he
returned
in
the
evening
he
told
me
he
had
himself
bought
her
one
for
honfleur
and
started
her
fairly
on
her
way
home
as
for
myself
i
had
spent
the
day
in
making
inquiries
at
the
offices
of
the
those
local
which
stand
at
every
entrance
into
a
town
or
village
in
france
for
the
gathering
of
trifling
vexatious
taxes
upon
articles
of
food
and
merchandise
at
one
of
these
i
had
learned
that
three
or
four
weeks
ago
a
young
englishwoman
with
a
little
girl
had
passed
by
on
foot
each
carrying
a
small
bundle
which
had
not
been
examined
it
was
the
on
the
road
to
granville
which
was
between
thirty
and
forty
miles
away
from
granville
was
the
nearest
route
to
the
channel
islands
was
it
not
possible
that
olivia
had
resolved
to
seek
refuge
there
again
perhaps
to
seek
me
my
heart
bowed
down
by
the
sad
picture
of
her
and
the
little
child
leaving
the
town
on
foot
beat
high
again
at
the
thought
of
olivia
in
guernsey
i
set
off
for
granville
by
the
omnibus
next
morning
and
made
further
inquiries
at
every
village
we
passed
through
whether
any
thing
had
been
seen
of
a
young
englishwoman
and
a
little
girl
at
first
the
answer
was
yes
then
it
became
a
matter
of
doubt
at
last
everywhere
they
replied
by
a
discouraging
no
at
one
point
of
our
journey
we
passed
a
dilapidated
with
a
rude
black
figure
of
the
virgin
hanging
below
it
i
could
just
decipher
upon
one
finger
of
the
post
in
letters
it
recurred
to
me
that
this
was
the
place
where
fever
was
raging
like
the
pest
it
is
a
poor
place
said
the
driver
disparagingly
there
is
nothing
there
but
the
fever
and
a
good
angel
of
a
curé
who
is
the
only
doctor
into
the
bargain
it
is
two
leagues
and
a
kilometre
and
it
is
on
the
road
to
nowhere
i
could
not
stop
in
my
quest
to
turn
aside
and
visit
this
village
smitten
with
fever
though
i
felt
a
strong
inclination
to
do
so
at
granville
i
learned
that
a
young
lady
and
a
child
had
made
the
voyage
to
jersey
a
short
time
before
and
i
went
on
with
stronger
hope
but
in
jersey
i
could
obtain
no
further
information
about
her
nor
in
guernsey
whither
i
felt
sure
olivia
would
certainly
have
proceeded
i
took
one
day
more
to
cross
over
to
sark
and
consult
tardif
but
he
knew
no
more
than
i
did
he
absolutely
refused
to
believe
that
olivia
was
dead
in
august
he
said
i
shall
hear
from
her
take
courage
and
comfort
she
promised
it
and
she
will
keep
her
promise
if
she
had
known
herself
to
be
dying
she
would
have
sent
me
word
it
is
a
long
time
to
wait
i
said
with
an
utter
sinking
of
spirit
it
is
a
long
time
to
wait
he
echoed
lifting
up
his
hands
and
letting
them
fall
again
with
a
gesture
of
weariness
but
we
must
wait
and
hope
to
wait
in
impatience
and
to
hope
at
times
and
despair
at
times
i
returned
to
london
chapter
the
the
law
of
marriage
one
of
my
first
proceedings
after
my
return
was
to
ascertain
how
the
english
law
stood
with
regard
to
olivia
position
fortunately
for
me
one
of
senior
oldest
friends
was
a
lawyer
of
great
repute
and
he
discussed
the
question
with
me
after
a
dinner
at
his
house
at
fulham
there
seems
to
be
no
proof
against
the
husband
of
any
kind
he
said
after
i
had
told
him
all
why
i
exclaimed
here
you
have
a
girl
brought
up
in
luxury
and
wealth
willing
to
brave
any
poverty
rather
than
continue
to
live
with
him
a
girl
whim
he
said
mania
perhaps
is
there
insanity
in
her
family
she
is
as
sane
as
i
am
i
answered
is
there
no
law
to
protect
a
wife
against
the
companionship
of
such
a
woman
as
this
second
mrs
foster
the
husband
introduces
her
as
his
cousin
he
rejoined
and
places
her
in
some
little
authority
on
the
plea
that
his
wife
is
too
young
to
be
left
alone
safely
in
continental
hotels
there
is
no
reasonable
objection
to
be
taken
to
that
then
foster
could
compel
her
to
return
to
him
i
said
as
far
as
i
see
into
the
case
he
certainly
could
was
the
answer
which
drove
me
nearly
frantic
but
there
is
this
second
marriage
i
objected
there
lies
the
kernel
of
the
case
he
said
daintily
peeling
his
walnuts
you
tell
me
there
are
papers
which
you
believe
to
be
forgeries
purporting
to
be
the
medical
certificate
with
corroborative
proof
of
her
death
now
if
the
wife
be
guilty
of
framing
these
the
husband
will
bring
them
against
her
as
the
grounds
on
which
he
felt
free
to
contract
his
second
marriage
she
has
done
a
very
foolish
and
a
very
wicked
thing
there
you
think
she
did
it
i
asked
he
smiled
significantly
but
without
saying
any
thing
i
can
not
i
cried
ah
you
are
blind
he
replied
with
the
same
maddening
smile
but
let
me
return
on
the
other
hand
the
husband
has
forged
these
papers
it
would
go
far
with
me
as
strong
presumptive
evidence
against
him
upon
which
we
might
go
in
for
a
divorce
not
a
separation
merely
if
the
young
lady
had
remained
with
him
till
she
had
collected
proof
of
his
unfaithfulness
to
her
this
with
his
subsequent
marriage
to
the
same
person
during
her
lifetime
would
probably
have
set
her
absolutely
free
divorced
from
him
i
said
divorce
he
repeated
but
what
can
be
done
now
i
asked
all
you
can
do
he
answered
is
to
establish
your
influence
over
this
fellow
and
go
cautiously
to
work
with
him
as
long
as
the
lady
is
in
france
if
she
be
alive
and
he
is
too
ill
to
go
after
her
she
is
safe
you
may
convince
him
by
degrees
that
it
is
to
his
interest
to
come
to
some
terms
with
her
a
formal
deed
of
separation
might
be
agreed
upon
and
drawn
up
but
even
that
will
not
perfectly
secure
her
in
the
future
i
was
compelled
to
remain
satisfied
with
this
opinion
yet
how
could
i
be
satisfied
while
olivia
if
she
was
still
living
was
wandering
about
homeless
and
as
i
feared
destitute
in
a
foreign
country
i
made
my
first
call
upon
foster
the
next
evening
foster
had
been
to
brook
street
every
day
since
her
return
to
inquire
for
me
and
to
leave
an
urgent
message
that
i
should
go
to
bellringer
street
as
soon
as
i
was
again
in
town
the
looked
almost
as
wretched
as
the
forsaken
dwelling
down
at
noireau
where
olivia
had
perhaps
been
living
and
the
stifling
musty
air
inside
it
almost
made
me
gasp
for
breath
so
you
are
come
back
was
foster
greeting
as
i
entered
the
dingy
room
yes
i
replied
i
need
not
ask
what
success
you
had
he
said
sneering
so
pale
and
wan
fond
lover
your
trip
has
not
agreed
with
you
that
is
plain
enough
it
did
not
agree
with
carry
either
for
she
came
back
swearing
she
would
never
go
on
such
a
chase
again
you
know
i
was
quite
opposed
to
her
going
no
i
said
incredulously
the
diamond
ring
had
disappeared
from
his
finger
and
it
was
easy
to
guess
how
the
funds
had
been
raised
for
the
journey
altogether
opposed
he
repeated
i
believe
olivia
is
dead
i
am
quite
sure
she
has
never
been
under
this
roof
with
me
as
miss
ellen
martineau
has
been
i
should
have
known
it
as
surely
as
ever
a
tiger
scented
its
prey
do
you
suppose
i
have
no
sense
keen
enough
to
tell
me
she
was
in
the
very
house
where
i
was
nonsense
i
answered
his
eyes
glistened
cruelly
and
made
me
almost
ready
to
spring
upon
him
i
could
have
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
shaken
him
to
death
in
my
sudden
passion
of
loathing
against
him
but
i
sat
quiet
and
ejaculated
nonsense
such
power
has
the
spirit
of
the
nineteenth
century
among
civilized
classes
olivia
is
dead
he
said
in
a
solemn
tone
i
am
convinced
of
that
from
another
reason
through
all
the
misery
of
our
marriage
i
never
knew
her
guilty
of
an
untruth
not
the
smallest
she
was
as
true
as
the
gospel
do
you
think
you
or
carry
could
make
me
believe
that
she
would
trifle
with
such
an
awful
subject
as
her
own
death
no
i
would
take
my
oath
that
olivia
would
never
have
had
that
letter
sent
or
write
to
me
those
few
lines
of
farewell
but
to
let
me
know
that
she
was
really
dead
his
voice
faltered
a
little
as
though
even
he
were
moved
by
the
thought
of
her
early
death
foster
glanced
at
him
jealously
and
he
looked
back
at
her
with
a
provoking
curve
about
his
lips
for
the
moment
there
was
more
hatred
than
love
in
the
regards
exchanged
between
them
i
saw
it
was
useless
to
pursue
the
subject
well
i
said
i
came
to
arrange
a
time
for
lowry
to
visit
you
with
me
for
the
purpose
of
a
thorough
examination
it
is
possible
that
senior
may
be
induced
to
join
us
though
he
has
retired
from
practice
i
am
anxious
for
his
opinion
as
well
as
lowry
you
really
wish
to
cure
me
he
answered
raising
his
eyebrows
to
be
sure
i
replied
i
can
have
no
other
object
in
undertaking
your
case
do
you
imagine
it
is
a
pleasure
to
me
it
is
possible
that
your
death
would
be
a
greater
benefit
to
the
world
than
your
life
but
that
is
no
question
for
me
to
decide
neither
is
it
for
me
to
consider
whether
you
are
my
friend
or
my
enemy
there
is
simply
a
life
to
be
saved
if
possible
whose
is
not
my
business
do
you
understand
me
i
think
so
he
said
i
am
nothing
except
material
for
you
to
exercise
your
craft
upon
precisely
i
answered
that
and
nothing
more
as
some
writer
says
is
a
mere
matter
of
instinct
with
me
i
attend
you
just
as
a
newfoundland
dog
saves
a
drowning
man
i
went
from
him
to
hanover
street
where
i
found
captain
carey
who
met
me
with
the
embarrassment
and
shamefacedness
of
a
young
girl
i
had
not
yet
seen
them
since
my
return
from
normandy
there
was
much
to
tell
them
though
they
already
knew
that
my
expedition
had
failed
and
that
it
was
still
doubtful
whether
ellen
martineau
and
olivia
were
the
same
person
captain
carey
walked
along
the
street
with
me
toward
home
he
had
taken
my
arm
in
his
most
confidential
manner
but
he
did
not
open
his
lips
till
we
reached
brook
street
martin
he
said
i
turned
it
over
in
my
own
mind
and
i
agree
with
tardif
olivia
is
no
more
dead
than
you
or
me
we
shall
find
out
all
about
it
in
august
if
not
before
cheer
up
my
boy
i
tell
you
what
julia
and
i
will
wait
till
we
are
sure
about
olivia
no
no
i
interrupted
you
and
julia
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
when
is
your
wedding
to
be
if
you
have
no
objection
he
answered
have
you
the
least
shadow
of
an
objection
not
a
shadow
of
a
shadow
i
said
well
then
he
resumed
bashfully
what
do
you
think
of
august
it
is
a
pleasant
month
and
would
give
us
time
for
that
trip
to
switzerland
you
know
not
any
sooner
because
of
your
poor
mother
and
later
if
you
like
that
better
not
a
day
later
i
said
my
father
has
been
married
again
these
four
months
yet
i
felt
a
little
sore
for
my
mother
memory
how
quickly
it
was
fading
away
from
every
heart
but
mine
if
i
could
but
go
to
her
now
and
pour
out
all
my
troubled
thoughts
into
her
listening
indulgent
ear
not
even
olivia
herself
who
could
never
be
to
me
more
than
she
was
at
this
moment
could
fill
her
place
chapter
the
fulfilling
the
pledge
we
that
is
senior
lowry
and
i
made
our
examination
of
foster
and
held
our
consultation
three
days
from
that
time
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
that
he
was
suffering
from
the
same
disease
as
that
which
had
been
the
death
of
my
mother
a
disease
almost
invariably
fatal
sooner
or
later
a
few
cases
of
cure
under
most
favorable
circumstances
had
been
reported
during
the
last
but
the
chances
were
dead
against
foster
recovery
in
all
probability
a
long
and
painful
illness
terminating
in
inevitable
death
lay
before
him
in
the
opinion
of
my
two
senior
physicians
all
that
i
could
do
would
be
to
alleviate
the
worst
pangs
of
it
his
case
haunted
me
day
and
night
in
that
deep
of
consciousness
which
lurks
beneath
our
surface
sensations
and
impressions
there
was
always
present
the
image
of
foster
with
his
pale
cynical
face
and
pitiless
eyes
with
this
was
the
perpetual
remembrance
that
a
subtile
malady
beyond
the
reach
of
our
skill
was
slowly
eating
away
his
life
the
man
i
abhorred
but
the
sufferer
mysteriously
linked
with
the
memories
which
clung
about
my
mother
aroused
her
most
urgent
instinctive
compassion
only
once
before
had
i
watched
the
conflict
between
disease
and
its
remedy
with
so
intense
an
interest
it
was
a
day
or
two
after
our
consultation
that
i
came
accidentally
upon
the
little
which
i
had
kept
in
guernsey
a
private
accessible
only
to
myself
it
was
night
jack
as
usual
was
gone
out
and
i
was
alone
i
turned
over
the
leaves
merely
for
listless
want
of
occupation
all
at
once
i
came
upon
an
entry
made
in
connection
with
my
mother
illness
which
recalled
to
me
the
discovery
i
believed
i
had
made
of
a
remedy
for
her
disease
had
it
only
been
applied
in
its
earlier
stages
it
had
slipped
out
of
my
mind
but
now
my
memory
leaped
upon
it
with
irresistible
force
i
must
tell
the
whole
truth
however
terrible
and
humiliating
it
may
be
whether
i
had
been
true
or
false
to
myself
up
to
that
moment
i
can
not
say
i
had
taken
upon
myself
the
care
and
if
possible
the
cure
of
this
man
who
was
my
enemy
if
i
had
an
enemy
in
the
world
his
life
and
mine
could
not
run
parallel
without
great
grief
and
hurt
to
me
and
to
one
dearer
than
myself
now
that
a
better
chance
was
thrust
upon
me
in
his
favor
i
shrank
from
seizing
it
with
unutterable
reluctance
i
turned
at
the
thought
of
it
i
tried
my
utmost
to
shake
off
the
grip
of
my
memory
was
it
possible
that
in
the
core
of
my
heart
i
wished
this
man
to
die
yes
i
wished
him
to
die
conscience
flashed
the
answer
across
the
inner
depths
of
my
soul
as
a
glare
of
lightning
over
the
sharp
crags
and
cruel
waves
of
our
island
in
a
midnight
storm
i
saw
with
terrible
distinctness
that
there
had
been
lurking
within
a
sure
sense
of
satisfaction
in
the
certainty
that
he
must
die
i
had
suspected
nothing
of
it
till
that
moment
when
i
told
him
it
was
the
instinct
of
a
physician
to
save
his
patient
i
spoke
the
truth
but
i
found
something
within
me
deeper
than
instinct
that
was
wailing
and
watching
for
the
fatal
issue
of
his
malady
with
a
tranquil
security
so
profound
that
it
never
stirred
the
surface
of
my
consciousness
or
lifted
up
its
ghostly
face
to
the
light
of
conscience
i
took
up
my
and
went
away
to
my
room
lest
jack
should
come
in
suddenly
and
read
my
secret
on
my
face
i
thrust
the
book
into
a
drawer
in
my
desk
and
locked
it
away
out
of
my
sight
what
need
had
i
to
trouble
myself
with
it
or
its
contents
i
found
a
book
one
of
charles
dickens
most
amusing
stories
and
set
myself
resolutely
to
read
it
laughing
aloud
at
its
drolleries
and
reading
faster
and
faster
while
all
the
time
thoughts
came
crowding
into
my
mind
of
my
mother
pale
worn
face
and
the
pains
she
suffered
and
the
remedy
found
out
too
late
these
images
grew
so
strong
at
last
that
my
eyes
ran
over
the
sentences
mechanically
but
my
brain
refused
to
take
in
the
meaning
of
them
i
threw
the
book
from
me
and
leaning
my
head
on
my
hands
i
let
all
the
waves
of
that
sorrowful
memory
flow
over
me
how
strong
they
were
how
persistent
i
could
hear
the
tones
of
her
languid
voice
and
see
the
light
lingering
to
the
last
in
her
dim
eyes
whenever
they
met
mine
a
shudder
crept
through
me
as
i
recollected
how
she
travelled
that
dolorous
road
slowly
day
by
day
down
to
the
grave
other
feet
were
beginning
to
tread
the
same
painful
journey
but
there
was
yet
time
to
stay
them
and
the
power
to
do
it
was
intrusted
to
me
what
was
i
to
do
with
my
power
it
seemed
cruel
that
this
power
should
come
to
me
from
my
death
if
she
were
living
still
or
if
she
had
died
from
any
other
cause
the
discovery
of
this
remedy
would
never
have
been
made
by
me
and
i
was
to
take
it
as
a
sort
of
miraculous
gift
purchased
by
her
pangs
and
bestow
it
upon
the
only
man
i
hated
for
i
hated
him
i
said
so
to
myself
muttering
the
words
between
my
teeth
what
was
the
value
of
his
life
that
i
should
ransom
it
by
such
a
sacrifice
a
mean
selfish
dissipated
life
a
life
that
would
be
olivia
curse
as
long
as
it
lasted
for
an
instant
a
vision
stood
out
clear
before
me
and
made
my
heart
beat
fast
of
olivia
free
as
she
must
be
in
the
space
of
a
few
months
should
i
leave
the
disease
to
take
its
course
free
and
happy
disenthralled
from
the
most
galling
of
all
bondage
could
i
not
win
her
then
she
knew
already
that
i
loved
her
would
she
not
soon
learn
to
love
me
in
return
if
olivia
were
living
what
an
irreparable
injury
it
would
be
to
her
for
this
man
to
recover
that
seemed
to
settle
the
question
i
could
not
be
the
one
to
doom
her
to
a
continuation
of
the
misery
she
was
enduring
it
was
irrational
and
of
my
conscience
to
demand
such
a
thing
from
me
i
would
use
all
the
means
practised
in
the
ordinary
course
of
treatment
to
render
the
recovery
of
my
patient
possible
and
so
fulfil
my
duty
i
would
carefully
follow
all
senior
suggestions
he
was
an
experienced
and
very
skilful
physician
i
could
not
do
better
than
submit
my
judgment
to
his
besides
how
did
i
know
that
this
fancied
discovery
of
mine
was
of
the
least
value
i
had
never
had
a
chance
of
making
experiment
of
it
and
no
doubt
it
was
an
idle
chimera
of
my
brain
when
it
was
overwrought
by
anxiety
for
my
mother
sake
i
had
not
hitherto
thought
enough
of
it
to
ask
the
opinion
of
any
of
my
medical
friends
and
colleagues
why
should
i
attach
any
importance
to
it
now
let
it
rest
not
a
soul
knew
of
it
but
myself
i
had
a
perfect
right
to
keep
or
destroy
my
own
notes
suppose
i
destroyed
that
one
at
once
i
unlocked
the
desk
and
took
out
my
book
again
the
leaf
on
which
these
special
notes
were
written
was
already
loose
and
might
have
been
easily
lost
at
any
time
i
thought
i
burned
it
by
the
flame
of
the
gas
and
threw
the
brown
ashes
into
the
grate
for
a
few
minutes
i
felt
elated
as
if
set
free
from
an
oppressive
burden
and
i
returned
to
the
story
i
had
been
reading
and
laughed
more
heartily
than
before
at
the
grotesque
turn
of
the
incidents
but
before
long
the
tormenting
question
came
up
again
the
notes
were
not
lost
they
seemed
now
to
be
burned
in
upon
my
brain
the
power
has
been
put
into
your
hands
to
save
life
said
my
conscience
and
you
are
resolving
to
let
it
perish
what
have
you
to
do
with
the
fact
that
the
nature
is
mean
selfish
cruel
it
is
the
physical
life
simply
that
you
have
to
deal
with
what
is
beyond
that
rests
in
the
hands
of
god
what
he
is
about
to
do
with
this
soul
is
no
question
for
you
your
office
pledges
you
to
cure
him
if
you
can
and
the
fulfilment
of
this
duty
is
required
of
you
if
you
let
this
man
die
you
are
a
murderer
but
i
said
in
answer
to
myself
consider
what
trivial
chances
the
whole
thing
has
hung
upon
besides
the
accident
that
this
was
my
malady
there
was
the
chance
of
lowry
not
being
called
from
home
the
man
was
his
patient
not
mine
after
that
there
was
the
chance
of
jack
going
to
see
him
instead
of
me
or
of
him
refusing
my
attendance
if
the
chain
had
broken
at
one
of
these
links
no
responsibility
could
have
fallen
upon
me
he
would
have
died
and
all
the
good
results
of
his
death
would
have
followed
naturally
let
it
rest
at
that
but
it
could
not
rest
at
that
i
fought
a
battle
with
myself
all
through
the
quiet
night
motionless
and
in
silence
lest
jack
should
become
aware
that
i
was
not
sleeping
how
should
i
ever
face
him
or
grasp
his
hearty
hand
again
with
such
a
secret
weight
upon
my
soul
yet
how
could
i
resolve
to
save
foster
at
the
cost
of
dooming
olivia
to
a
bondage
should
he
discover
where
she
was
or
to
poverty
should
she
remain
concealed
if
i
were
only
sure
that
she
was
alive
but
if
she
were
dead
why
then
all
motive
for
keeping
back
this
chance
of
saving
him
would
be
taken
away
it
was
for
her
sake
merely
that
i
hesitated
for
her
sake
but
for
my
own
as
well
said
my
conscience
for
the
subtle
hope
which
had
taken
deeper
root
day
by
day
that
the
only
obstacle
between
us
would
be
removed
suppose
then
that
he
was
dead
and
olivia
was
free
to
love
me
to
become
my
wife
would
not
her
very
closeness
to
me
be
a
reproving
presence
forever
at
my
side
could
i
ever
recall
the
days
before
our
marriage
as
men
recall
them
when
they
are
growing
gray
and
wrinkled
as
a
happy
golden
time
would
there
not
always
be
a
haunting
sense
of
perfidy
and
disloyalty
to
duty
standing
between
me
and
her
clear
truth
and
singleness
of
heart
there
could
be
no
happiness
for
me
even
with
olivia
my
cherished
and
honored
wife
if
i
had
this
weight
and
cloud
resting
upon
my
conscience
the
morning
dawned
before
i
could
decide
the
decision
when
made
brought
no
feeling
of
relief
or
triumph
to
me
as
soon
as
it
was
probable
that
senior
could
see
me
i
was
at
his
house
at
fulham
and
in
rapid
almost
incoherent
words
laid
what
i
believed
to
be
my
important
discovery
before
him
he
sat
thinking
for
some
time
running
over
in
his
own
mind
such
cases
as
had
come
under
his
own
observation
after
a
while
a
gleam
of
pleasure
passed
over
his
face
and
his
eyes
brightened
as
he
looked
at
me
i
congratulate
you
martin
he
said
though
i
wish
jack
had
hit
upon
this
i
believe
it
will
prove
a
real
benefit
to
our
science
let
me
turn
it
over
a
little
longer
and
consult
some
of
my
colleagues
about
it
but
i
think
you
are
right
you
are
about
to
try
it
on
poor
foster
yes
i
answered
with
a
chilly
sensation
in
my
veins
the
natural
reaction
upon
the
excitement
of
the
past
night
it
can
do
him
no
harm
he
said
and
in
my
opinion
it
will
prolong
his
life
to
old
age
if
he
is
careful
of
himself
i
will
write
a
paper
on
the
subject
for
the
if
you
will
allow
me
with
all
my
heart
i
said
sadly
the
old
physician
regarded
me
for
a
minute
with
his
keen
eyes
which
had
looked
through
the
window
of
disease
into
many
a
human
soul
i
shrank
from
the
scrutiny
but
i
need
not
have
done
so
he
grasped
my
hand
firmly
and
closely
in
his
own
god
bless
you
martin
he
said
god
bless
you
chapter
the
a
deed
of
separation
that
keen
benevolent
glance
of
senior
was
like
a
gleam
of
sunlight
piercing
through
the
deepest
recesses
of
my
troubled
spirit
i
felt
that
i
was
no
longer
fighting
my
fight
out
alone
a
friendly
eye
was
upon
me
a
friendly
voice
was
cheering
me
on
the
dead
shall
look
me
through
and
through
says
tennyson
for
my
part
i
should
wish
for
a
good
wise
man
to
look
me
through
and
through
feel
the
pulse
of
my
soul
from
time
to
time
when
it
was
ailing
and
detect
what
was
there
contrary
to
reason
and
to
right
senior
hearty
god
bless
you
brought
strength
and
blessing
with
it
i
went
straight
from
fulham
to
bellringer
street
a
healthy
impulse
to
fulfil
all
my
duty
however
difficult
was
in
its
first
fervid
moment
of
action
nevertheless
there
was
a
subtle
hope
within
me
founded
upon
one
chance
that
was
left
it
was
just
possible
that
foster
might
refuse
to
be
made
the
subject
of
an
experiment
for
an
experiment
it
was
i
found
him
not
yet
out
of
bed
foster
was
busy
at
her
task
of
engrossing
in
the
a
task
she
performed
so
well
that
i
could
not
believe
but
that
she
had
been
long
accustomed
to
it
i
followed
her
to
foster
bedroom
a
small
close
attic
at
the
back
with
a
cheerless
view
of
chimneys
and
the
roofs
of
houses
there
was
no
means
of
ventilation
except
by
opening
a
window
near
the
head
of
the
bed
when
the
draught
of
cold
air
would
blow
full
upon
him
he
looked
exceedingly
worn
and
wan
the
doubt
crossed
me
whether
the
disease
had
not
made
more
progress
than
we
supposed
his
face
fell
as
he
saw
the
expression
upon
mine
worse
eh
he
said
do
say
i
am
worse
i
sat
down
beside
him
and
told
him
what
i
believed
to
be
his
chance
of
life
not
concealing
from
him
that
i
proposed
to
try
if
he
gave
his
consent
a
mode
of
treatment
which
had
never
been
practised
before
his
eye
keen
and
sharp
as
that
of
a
lynx
seemed
to
read
my
thoughts
as
senior
had
done
martin
dobrée
he
said
in
a
voice
so
different
from
his
ordinary
caustic
tone
that
it
almost
startled
me
i
can
trust
you
i
put
myself
with
implicit
confidence
into
your
hands
the
last
chance
dare
i
say
the
last
hope
was
gone
i
stood
pledged
on
my
honor
as
a
physician
to
employ
this
discovery
which
had
been
laid
open
to
me
by
my
mother
fatal
illness
for
the
benefit
of
the
man
whose
life
was
most
harmful
to
olivia
and
myself
i
felt
suffocated
stifled
i
opened
the
window
for
a
minute
or
two
and
leaned
through
it
to
catch
the
fresh
breath
of
the
outer
air
i
must
tell
you
i
said
when
i
drew
my
head
in
again
that
you
must
not
expect
to
regain
your
health
and
strength
so
completely
as
to
be
able
to
return
to
your
old
dissipations
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
lead
a
regular
quiet
abstemious
life
avoiding
all
excitement
nine
months
out
of
the
twelve
at
least
if
not
the
whole
year
you
must
spend
in
the
country
for
the
sake
of
fresh
air
a
life
in
town
would
kill
you
in
six
months
but
if
you
are
careful
of
yourself
you
may
live
to
sixty
or
seventy
life
at
any
price
he
answered
in
his
old
accents
yet
you
put
it
in
a
dreary
light
before
me
it
hardly
seems
worth
while
to
buy
such
an
existence
especially
with
that
wife
of
mine
downstairs
who
can
not
endure
the
country
and
is
only
a
companion
for
a
now
if
it
had
been
olivia
you
could
imagine
life
in
the
country
endurable
with
olivia
what
could
i
answer
to
such
a
question
which
ran
through
me
like
an
electric
shock
a
brilliant
phantasmagoria
flashed
across
my
brain
a
house
in
guernsey
with
olivia
in
it
sunshine
flowers
the
singing
of
birds
the
music
of
the
sea
the
pure
exhilarating
atmosphere
it
had
vanished
into
a
dead
blank
before
i
opened
my
mouth
though
probably
a
moment
silence
had
not
intervened
foster
lips
were
curled
into
a
mocking
smile
there
would
be
more
chance
for
you
now
i
said
if
you
could
have
better
air
than
this
how
can
i
he
asked
be
frank
with
me
i
answered
and
tell
me
what
your
means
are
it
would
be
worth
your
while
to
spend
your
last
farthing
upon
this
chance
is
it
not
enough
to
make
a
man
mad
he
said
to
know
there
are
thousands
lying
in
the
bank
in
his
wife
name
and
he
can
not
touch
a
penny
of
it
it
is
life
itself
to
me
yet
i
may
die
like
a
dog
in
this
hole
for
the
want
of
it
my
death
will
lie
at
olivia
door
curse
her
he
fell
back
upon
his
pillows
with
a
groan
as
heavy
and
deep
as
ever
came
from
the
heart
of
a
wretch
perishing
from
sheer
want
i
could
not
choose
but
feel
some
pity
for
him
but
this
was
an
opportunity
i
must
not
miss
it
is
of
no
use
to
curse
her
i
said
come
foster
let
us
talk
over
this
matter
quietly
and
reasonably
if
olivia
be
alive
as
i
can
not
help
hoping
she
is
your
wisest
course
would
be
to
come
to
some
mutual
agreement
release
you
both
from
your
present
difficulties
for
you
must
recollect
she
is
as
penniless
as
yourself
let
me
speak
to
you
as
if
i
were
her
brother
of
this
one
thing
you
may
be
quite
certain
she
will
never
consent
to
return
to
you
and
in
that
i
will
aid
her
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
but
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
have
a
good
share
of
the
property
which
she
would
gladly
relinquish
on
condition
that
you
left
her
alone
now
just
listen
carefully
i
think
there
would
be
small
difficulty
if
we
set
about
it
in
proving
that
you
were
guilty
against
her
with
your
present
wife
and
in
that
case
she
could
claim
a
divorce
absolutely
and
her
property
would
remain
her
own
your
second
marriage
with
the
same
person
would
set
her
free
from
you
altogether
you
could
prove
nothing
he
replied
fiercely
and
my
second
marriage
is
covered
by
the
documents
i
could
produce
which
are
forged
i
said
calmly
we
will
find
out
by
whom
you
are
in
a
net
of
your
own
making
but
we
do
not
wish
to
push
this
question
to
a
legal
issue
let
us
come
to
some
arrangement
olivia
will
consent
to
any
terms
i
agree
to
unconsciously
i
was
speaking
as
if
i
knew
where
olivia
was
and
could
communicate
with
her
when
i
chose
i
was
merely
anticipating
the
time
when
tardif
felt
sure
of
hearing
from
her
foster
lay
still
watching
me
with
his
cold
keen
eyes
if
those
letters
are
forged
he
said
uneasily
it
is
olivia
who
has
forged
them
but
i
must
consult
my
lawyers
i
will
let
you
know
the
result
in
a
few
days
but
the
same
evening
i
received
a
note
desiring
me
to
go
and
see
him
immediately
i
was
myself
in
a
fever
of
impatience
and
glad
at
the
prospect
of
any
settlement
of
this
subject
in
the
hope
of
setting
olivia
free
as
far
as
she
could
be
free
during
his
lifetime
he
was
looking
brighter
and
better
than
in
the
morning
and
an
odd
smile
played
now
and
then
about
his
face
as
he
talked
to
me
after
having
desired
foster
to
leave
us
alone
together
mark
he
said
i
have
not
the
slightest
reason
to
doubt
death
except
your
own
opinion
to
the
contrary
which
is
founded
upon
reasons
of
which
i
know
nothing
but
acting
on
the
supposition
that
she
may
be
still
alive
i
am
quite
willing
to
enter
into
negotiations
with
her
i
suppose
it
must
be
through
you
it
must
i
answered
and
it
can
not
be
at
present
you
will
have
to
wait
for
some
months
perhaps
while
i
pursue
my
search
for
her
i
do
not
know
where
she
is
any
more
than
you
do
a
vivid
gleam
crossed
his
face
at
these
words
but
whether
of
incredulity
or
satisfaction
i
could
not
tell
but
suppose
i
die
in
the
mean
time
he
objected
that
objection
was
a
fair
and
obvious
one
his
malady
would
not
pause
in
its
insidious
attack
while
i
was
seeking
olivia
i
deliberated
for
a
few
minutes
endeavoring
to
look
at
a
scheme
which
presented
itself
to
me
from
every
point
of
view
i
do
not
know
that
i
might
not
leave
you
in
your
present
position
i
said
at
last
it
may
be
i
am
acting
from
an
sense
of
duty
but
if
you
will
give
me
a
formal
deed
protecting
her
from
yourself
i
am
willing
to
advance
the
funds
necessary
to
remove
you
to
purer
air
and
more
open
quarters
than
these
a
deed
of
separation
which
both
of
you
must
sign
can
be
drawn
up
and
receive
your
signature
there
will
be
no
doubt
as
to
getting
hers
when
we
find
her
but
that
may
be
some
months
hence
as
i
said
still
i
will
run
the
risk
for
her
sake
he
said
with
a
sneer
for
her
sake
simply
i
answered
i
will
employ
a
lawyer
to
draw
up
the
deed
and
as
soon
as
you
sign
it
i
will
advance
the
money
you
require
my
treatment
of
your
disease
i
shall
begin
at
once
that
falls
under
my
duty
as
your
doctor
but
i
warn
you
that
fresh
air
and
freedom
from
agitation
are
almost
if
not
positively
essential
to
its
success
the
sooner
you
secure
these
for
yourself
the
better
your
chance
some
further
conversation
passed
between
us
as
to
the
stipulations
to
be
insisted
upon
and
the
division
of
the
yearly
income
from
property
for
i
would
not
agree
to
her
alienating
any
portion
of
it
foster
wished
to
drive
a
hard
bargain
still
with
that
odd
smile
on
his
face
and
it
was
after
much
discussion
that
we
came
to
an
agreement
i
had
the
deed
drawn
up
by
a
lawyer
who
warned
me
that
if
foster
sued
for
a
restitution
of
his
rights
they
would
be
enforced
but
i
hoped
that
when
olivia
was
found
she
would
have
some
evidence
in
her
own
favor
which
would
deter
him
from
carrying
the
case
into
court
the
deed
was
signed
by
foster
and
left
in
my
charge
till
olivia
signature
could
be
obtained
as
soon
as
the
deed
was
secured
i
had
my
patient
removed
from
bellringer
street
to
some
apartments
in
fulham
near
to
senior
whose
interest
in
the
case
was
now
almost
equal
to
my
own
here
if
i
could
not
visit
him
every
day
senior
did
while
his
great
professional
skill
enabled
him
to
detect
symptoms
which
might
have
escaped
my
less
experienced
eye
never
had
any
sufferer
under
the
highest
and
wealthiest
ranks
greater
care
and
science
expended
upon
him
than
richard
foster
the
progress
of
his
recovery
was
slow
but
it
was
sure
i
felt
that
it
would
be
so
from
the
first
day
by
day
i
watched
the
pallid
hue
of
sickness
upon
his
face
changing
into
a
more
natural
tone
i
saw
his
strength
coming
back
by
slight
but
steady
degrees
the
malady
was
forced
to
retreat
into
its
most
hidden
citadel
where
it
might
lurk
as
a
prisoner
but
not
dwell
as
a
destroyer
for
many
years
to
come
if
foster
would
yield
himself
to
the
of
life
we
prescribed
but
the
malady
lingered
there
ready
to
break
out
again
openly
if
its
were
set
ajar
i
had
given
life
to
him
but
it
was
his
part
to
hold
it
fast
there
was
no
triumph
to
me
in
this
as
there
would
have
been
had
my
patient
been
any
one
else
the
cure
aroused
much
interest
among
my
colleagues
and
made
my
name
more
known
but
what
was
that
to
me
as
long
as
this
man
lived
olivia
was
doomed
to
a
lonely
and
friendless
life
i
tried
to
look
into
the
future
for
her
and
saw
it
stretch
out
into
long
dreary
years
i
wondered
where
she
would
find
a
home
could
i
persuade
johanna
to
receive
her
into
her
pleasant
dwelling
which
would
become
so
lonely
to
her
when
captain
carey
had
moved
into
julia
house
in
that
was
the
best
plan
i
could
form
chapter
the
a
friendly
cabman
julia
marriage
arrangements
were
going
on
speedily
there
was
something
ironical
to
me
in
the
chance
that
made
me
so
often
the
witness
of
them
we
were
so
merely
cousins
again
that
she
discussed
her
purchases
and
displayed
them
before
me
as
if
there
had
never
been
any
notion
between
us
of
keeping
house
together
once
more
i
assisted
in
the
choice
of
a
for
the
one
made
a
year
before
was
said
to
be
yellow
and
but
this
time
julia
did
not
insist
upon
having
white
satin
a
dainty
tint
of
gray
was
considered
more
suitable
either
to
her
own
complexion
or
the
age
of
the
bridegroom
captain
carey
enjoyed
the
purchase
with
the
rapture
i
had
failed
to
experience
the
wedding
was
fixed
to
take
place
the
last
week
in
july
a
fortnight
earlier
than
the
time
proposed
it
was
also
a
fortnight
earlier
than
the
date
i
was
looking
forward
to
most
anxiously
when
if
ever
news
would
reach
tardif
from
olivia
all
my
plans
were
most
carefully
made
in
the
event
of
her
sending
word
where
she
was
the
deed
of
separation
signed
by
foster
was
preserved
by
me
most
cautiously
for
i
had
a
sort
of
haunting
dread
that
foster
would
endeavor
to
get
possession
of
it
she
was
eminently
sulky
and
had
been
so
ever
since
the
signing
of
the
deed
now
that
foster
was
very
near
convalescence
they
might
be
trying
some
stratagem
to
recover
it
but
our
servants
were
trustworthy
and
the
deed
lay
safe
in
the
drawer
of
my
desk
at
last
senior
agreed
with
me
that
foster
was
sufficiently
advanced
on
the
road
to
recovery
to
be
removed
from
fulham
to
the
better
air
of
the
south
coast
the
month
of
may
had
been
hotter
than
usual
and
june
was
sultry
it
was
evidently
to
our
patient
advantage
to
exchange
the
atmosphere
of
london
for
that
of
the
even
though
he
had
to
dispense
with
our
watchful
attendance
in
fact
he
could
not
very
well
fall
back
now
with
common
prudence
and
we
impressed
upon
him
the
urgent
necessity
of
these
virtues
and
required
foster
to
write
us
fully
three
times
a
week
every
variation
she
might
observe
in
his
health
after
that
we
started
them
off
to
a
quiet
village
in
sussex
i
breathed
more
freely
when
they
were
out
of
my
daily
sphere
of
duty
but
before
they
went
a
hint
of
treachery
reached
me
which
put
me
doubly
on
my
guard
one
morning
when
jack
and
i
were
at
breakfast
each
deep
in
our
papers
with
an
occasional
comment
to
one
another
on
their
contents
simmons
the
cabby
was
announced
as
asking
to
speak
to
one
or
both
of
us
immediately
he
was
a
favorite
with
jack
who
bade
the
servant
show
him
in
and
simmons
appeared
stroking
his
hat
round
and
round
with
his
hand
as
if
hardly
knowing
what
to
do
with
his
limbs
off
the
box
nothing
amiss
with
your
wife
or
the
brats
i
hope
said
jack
no
john
no
he
answered
there
ai
any
thing
amiss
with
them
except
being
too
many
of
and
my
old
woman
wo
own
to
that
but
there
some
thing
in
the
wind
as
concerns
dobry
so
i
thought
i
better
come
and
give
you
a
hint
of
it
very
good
simmons
said
jack
you
recollect
taking
my
cab
to
road
about
this
time
last
year
when
i
showed
up
so
green
do
you
he
asked
to
be
sure
i
said
throwing
down
my
paper
and
listening
eagerly
well
doctors
he
continued
addressing
us
both
the
very
last
monday
as
ever
was
a
lady
walks
slowly
along
the
stand
eying
us
all
very
hard
but
taking
no
heed
to
any
of
till
she
catches
sight
of
that
not
a
uncommon
event
doctors
my
wife
says
there
something
about
me
as
gives
confidence
to
her
sex
anyhow
so
it
is
and
i
gainsay
it
the
lady
comes
along
very
slowly
she
looks
hard
at
me
she
nods
her
head
as
much
as
to
say
and
your
cab
and
your
horse
are
what
i
on
the
lookout
for
and
i
gets
down
opens
the
door
and
sees
her
in
quite
comfortable
says
she
me
to
scott
and
brown
in
road
no
i
ejaculated
yes
doctors
replied
simmons
me
she
says
scott
and
brown
road
of
course
i
knew
the
name
again
i
was
vexed
enough
the
last
time
i
were
there
at
showing
myself
so
green
i
looks
hard
at
her
a
very
fine
make
of
a
woman
with
hair
and
eyes
as
black
as
coals
and
a
impudent
look
on
her
face
somehow
i
turned
it
over
and
over
again
in
my
head
driving
her
there
could
there
be
any
reason
in
it
or
had
it
any
thing
to
do
with
last
time
and
cetera
she
told
me
to
wait
for
her
in
the
street
and
directly
after
she
goes
in
there
comes
down
the
gent
i
had
seen
before
with
a
pen
behind
his
ear
he
looks
very
hard
at
me
and
me
at
him
says
he
think
i
have
seen
your
face
before
my
man
very
civil
as
civil
as
a
orange
as
folks
say
think
you
have
i
says
you
step
for
a
minute
or
two
says
he
very
polite
find
a
boy
to
take
charge
of
your
horse
and
he
slips
a
into
my
hand
quite
pleasant
so
you
went
in
of
course
said
jack
doctors
he
answered
solemnly
i
did
go
in
there
nothing
to
be
said
against
that
the
lady
is
sitting
in
a
orfice
talking
to
another
gent
with
hair
and
eyes
like
hers
as
black
as
coals
and
the
same
look
of
brass
on
his
face
all
three
of
looked
a
little
under
the
weather
your
name
my
man
asked
the
black
gent
i
says
where
do
you
live
he
says
taking
me
serious
queer
street
i
says
with
a
little
wink
to
show
i
were
up
to
a
trick
or
two
they
all
three
larfed
a
little
among
themselves
but
not
in
a
pleasant
sort
of
way
then
the
gent
begins
again
good
fellow
he
says
want
you
to
give
us
a
little
information
that
be
of
use
to
us
and
we
are
willing
to
pay
you
handsome
for
it
it
ca
do
you
any
harm
nor
nobody
else
for
it
only
a
matter
of
business
you
not
above
taking
ten
shillings
for
a
bit
of
useful
information
by
no
manner
of
means
i
says
go
on
i
said
impatiently
as
simmons
paused
to
look
as
hard
at
us
as
he
had
done
at
these
people
jest
so
doctors
he
continued
but
this
time
i
was
minding
my
p
and
q
know
senior
of
brook
street
he
says
old
doctor
i
says
retired
out
of
town
he
says
the
young
doctor
neither
but
there
another
of
is
there
dobry
i
says
he
says
often
takes
your
cab
my
friend
one
and
then
the
other
i
says
john
and
sometimes
dobry
they
as
thick
as
brothers
and
thicker
friends
of
yours
he
says
says
i
take
my
cab
when
they
can
have
it
but
there
not
much
friendship
as
i
see
in
that
it
the
best
cab
and
horse
on
the
stand
though
i
say
it
as
should
john
pretty
fair
but
the
other
no
great
favorite
of
mine
he
says
simmons
face
was
illuminated
with
delight
and
he
winked
sportively
at
us
it
were
all
flummery
doctors
he
said
i
do
deny
as
john
is
a
older
friend
and
a
older
favorite
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
i
jest
see
them
setting
a
trap
and
i
wanted
to
have
a
finger
in
it
he
says
we
want
to
know
but
we
do
want
to
know
that
very
particular
is
where
you
drive
dobry
to
the
oftenest
he
going
to
borrow
money
from
us
and
we
like
to
find
out
something
about
his
habits
specially
where
he
spends
his
spare
time
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
you
understand
you
know
where
he
goes
in
your
cab
course
i
do
i
says
drove
him
and
john
here
nigh
a
twelvemonth
ago
the
other
gent
took
my
number
down
and
knew
where
to
look
for
me
when
you
wanted
me
a
clever
fellow
he
says
my
old
woman
thinks
i
says
you
be
glad
to
earn
a
little
more
for
your
old
woman
he
says
me
i
says
then
says
he
a
offer
for
you
if
you
bring
us
word
where
he
spends
his
spare
time
we
give
you
ten
shillings
and
if
it
turns
out
of
any
use
to
us
well
make
it
five
pounds
good
i
says
not
got
any
information
to
tell
us
at
once
he
says
no
i
says
i
keep
my
eye
upon
him
now
he
says
as
i
were
going
away
keep
a
carriage
of
course
course
i
says
the
good
of
a
doctor
that
has
a
carriage
and
pair
they
use
it
at
night
says
he
often
says
i
take
a
cab
mine
if
it
on
the
stand
good
he
says
my
friend
so
i
come
away
and
drives
back
again
to
the
stand
and
you
left
the
lady
there
i
asked
with
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
it
was
foster
yes
doctor
he
answered
talking
away
like
a
with
the
gent
that
were
last
monday
friday
and
this
morning
there
comes
this
bit
of
a
note
to
me
at
our
house
in
dawson
street
so
my
old
woman
says
you
better
go
and
show
it
to
dr
john
that
what
brought
me
here
at
this
time
doctors
he
gave
the
note
into
jack
hands
and
he
after
glancing
at
it
passed
it
on
to
me
the
contents
were
simply
these
words
james
simmons
is
requested
to
call
at
road
at
friday
evening
the
handwriting
struck
me
as
one
i
had
seen
and
noticed
before
i
scanned
it
more
closely
for
a
minute
or
two
then
a
glimmering
of
light
began
to
dawn
upon
my
memory
could
it
be
i
felt
almost
sure
it
was
in
another
minute
i
was
persuaded
that
it
was
the
same
hand
as
that
which
had
written
the
letter
announcing
olivia
death
probably
if
i
could
see
the
penmanship
of
the
other
partner
i
should
find
it
to
be
identical
with
that
of
the
medical
certificate
which
had
accompanied
the
letter
leave
this
note
with
me
simmons
i
said
giving
him
half
a
crown
in
exchange
for
it
i
was
satisfied
now
that
the
papers
had
been
forged
but
not
with
olivia
connivance
was
foster
himself
a
party
to
it
or
had
foster
alone
with
the
aid
of
these
friends
or
relatives
of
hers
plotted
and
carried
out
the
scheme
leaving
him
in
ignorance
and
doubt
like
my
own
chapter
the
julia
wedding
before
the
careys
and
julia
returned
to
guernsey
captain
carey
came
to
see
me
one
evening
at
our
own
house
in
brook
street
he
seemed
suffering
from
some
embarrassment
and
shyness
and
i
could
not
for
some
time
lead
him
to
the
point
he
was
longing
to
gain
you
are
quite
reconciled
to
all
this
martin
he
said
stammering
i
knew
very
well
what
he
meant
more
than
reconciled
i
answered
i
am
heartily
glad
of
it
julia
will
make
you
an
excellent
wife
i
am
sure
of
that
he
said
simply
yet
it
makes
me
nervous
a
little
at
times
to
think
i
may
be
standing
in
your
light
i
never
thought
what
it
was
coming
to
when
i
tried
to
comfort
julia
about
you
or
i
would
have
left
johanna
to
do
it
all
it
is
very
difficult
to
console
a
person
without
seeming
very
fond
of
them
and
then
there
the
danger
of
them
growing
fond
of
you
i
love
julia
now
with
all
my
heart
but
i
did
not
begin
comforting
her
with
that
view
and
i
am
sure
you
exonerate
me
martin
quite
quite
i
said
almost
laughing
at
his
contrition
i
should
never
have
married
julia
believe
me
and
i
am
delighted
that
she
is
going
to
be
married
especially
to
an
old
friend
like
you
i
shall
make
your
house
my
home
do
martin
he
answered
his
face
brightening
and
now
i
am
come
to
ask
you
a
great
favor
a
favor
to
us
all
i
do
it
i
promise
that
beforehand
i
said
we
have
all
set
our
hearts
on
your
being
my
best
man
he
replied
at
the
wedding
you
know
johanna
says
nothing
will
convince
the
guernsey
people
that
we
are
all
good
friends
except
that
it
will
have
a
queer
look
but
if
you
are
there
everybody
will
be
satisfied
that
you
do
not
blame
either
julia
or
me
i
know
it
will
be
hard
for
you
dear
martin
because
of
your
poor
mother
and
your
father
being
in
guernsey
still
but
if
you
can
conquer
that
for
our
sakes
you
would
make
us
every
one
perfectly
happy
i
had
not
expected
them
to
ask
this
but
when
i
came
to
think
of
it
it
seemed
very
natural
and
reasonable
there
was
no
motive
strong
enough
to
make
me
refuse
to
go
to
julia
wedding
so
i
arranged
to
be
with
them
the
last
week
in
july
about
ten
days
before
going
i
ran
down
to
the
little
village
on
the
sussex
coast
to
visit
foster
from
whom
or
from
his
wife
i
had
received
a
letter
regularly
three
times
a
week
i
found
him
as
near
complete
health
as
he
could
ever
expect
to
be
and
i
told
him
so
but
i
impressed
upon
him
the
urgent
necessity
of
keeping
himself
quiet
and
unexcited
he
listened
with
that
cool
taunting
sneer
which
had
always
irritated
me
ah
you
doctors
are
like
mothers
he
said
who
try
to
frighten
their
children
with
bogies
a
doctor
is
a
good
crutch
to
lean
upon
when
one
is
quite
lame
but
i
shall
be
glad
to
dispense
with
my
crutch
as
soon
as
my
lameness
is
gone
very
good
i
replied
you
know
your
life
is
of
no
value
to
me
i
have
simply
done
my
duty
by
you
your
mother
dobrée
wrote
to
me
this
week
he
remarked
smiling
as
i
winced
at
the
utterance
of
that
name
she
tells
me
there
is
to
be
a
grand
wedding
in
guernsey
that
of
your
julia
dobrée
with
captain
carey
you
are
to
be
present
so
she
says
yes
i
replied
it
will
be
a
pleasure
to
you
to
revisit
your
native
island
he
said
particularly
under
such
circumstances
i
took
no
notice
of
the
taunt
my
conversation
with
this
man
invariably
led
to
full
stops
he
said
something
to
which
silence
was
the
best
retort
i
did
not
stay
long
with
him
for
the
train
by
which
i
was
to
return
passed
through
the
village
in
less
than
an
hour
from
my
arrival
as
i
walked
down
the
little
street
i
turned
round
once
by
a
sudden
impulse
and
saw
foster
gazing
after
me
with
his
pale
face
and
glittering
eyes
ho
waved
his
hand
in
farewell
to
me
and
that
was
the
last
i
saw
of
him
some
days
after
this
i
crossed
in
the
to
guernsey
on
a
monday
night
as
the
wedding
was
to
take
place
at
an
early
hour
on
wednesday
morning
in
time
for
captain
carey
and
julia
to
catch
the
boat
to
england
the
old
gray
town
built
street
above
street
on
the
rock
facing
the
sea
rose
before
my
eyes
bathed
in
the
morning
sunlight
but
there
was
no
home
in
it
for
me
now
the
old
familiar
house
in
the
grange
road
was
already
occupied
by
strangers
i
did
not
even
know
where
i
was
to
go
i
did
not
like
the
idea
of
staying
under
julia
roof
where
every
thing
would
remind
me
of
that
short
spell
of
happiness
in
my
mother
life
when
she
was
preparing
it
for
my
future
home
luckily
before
the
steamer
touched
the
pier
i
caught
sight
of
captain
welcome
face
looking
out
for
my
appearance
he
stood
at
the
end
of
the
gangway
as
i
crossed
over
it
with
my
portmanteau
come
along
martin
hee
said
you
are
to
go
with
me
to
the
vale
as
my
groomsman
you
know
are
all
the
people
staring
at
us
do
you
think
i
dare
look
round
just
look
about
you
for
me
my
boy
they
are
staring
awfully
i
answered
and
there
are
scores
of
them
waiting
to
shake
hands
with
us
oh
they
must
not
he
said
earnestly
look
as
if
you
did
not
see
them
martin
that
the
worst
of
getting
married
yet
most
of
them
are
married
themselves
and
ought
to
know
better
there
the
waiting
for
us
a
few
yards
off
if
we
could
only
get
to
it
i
have
kept
my
face
seaward
ever
since
i
came
on
the
pier
with
my
collar
turned
up
and
my
hat
over
my
eyes
are
you
sure
they
see
who
we
are
sure
i
cried
why
there
carey
dobrée
and
dobrée
carey
and
brock
de
jersey
and
de
jersey
le
cocq
and
scores
of
others
they
know
us
as
well
as
their
own
brothers
we
shall
have
to
shake
hands
with
every
one
of
them
why
did
you
come
in
disguise
asked
captain
carey
reproachfully
but
before
i
could
answer
i
was
seized
upon
by
the
nearest
of
our
cousins
and
we
were
whirled
into
a
very
vortex
of
greetings
and
congratulations
it
was
fully
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
we
were
allowed
to
drive
off
in
the
and
captain
carey
was
almost
breathless
with
exhaustion
they
are
good
fellows
he
said
after
a
time
very
good
fellows
but
it
is
trying
is
it
martin
it
is
as
if
no
man
was
ever
married
before
though
they
have
gone
through
it
themselves
and
ought
to
know
how
one
feels
now
you
take
it
quietly
my
boy
and
you
do
not
know
how
deeply
i
feel
obliged
to
you
there
was
some
reason
for
me
to
take
it
quietly
i
could
not
help
thinking
how
nearly
i
had
been
myself
in
captain
carey
position
i
knew
that
julia
and
i
would
have
led
a
tranquil
pleasant
enough
life
together
but
for
the
unlucky
fate
that
had
carried
me
across
to
sark
to
fall
in
love
with
olivia
there
was
something
enviable
in
the
tranquil
prosperity
i
had
forfeited
guernsey
was
the
dearest
spot
on
earth
to
me
yet
i
was
practically
banished
from
it
julia
was
beyond
all
doubt
the
woman
i
loved
most
next
to
olivia
but
she
was
lost
to
me
there
was
no
hope
for
me
on
the
other
hand
foster
was
well
again
and
by
my
means
probably
i
might
secure
peace
and
comparative
freedom
for
olivia
but
that
was
all
she
could
never
be
more
to
me
than
she
was
now
my
only
prospect
was
that
of
a
dreary
bachelorhood
and
captain
carey
bashful
exultation
made
the
future
seem
less
tolerable
to
me
i
felt
it
more
still
when
after
dinner
in
the
cool
of
the
summer
evening
we
drove
lack
into
town
to
see
julia
for
the
last
time
before
we
met
in
church
the
next
morning
there
was
an
air
of
glad
excitement
pervading
the
house
friends
were
running
in
with
gifts
and
pleasant
words
of
congratulation
julia
herself
had
a
peculiar
modest
stateliness
and
frank
dignity
which
suited
her
well
she
was
happy
and
content
and
her
face
glowed
captain
carey
manner
was
one
of
tender
chivalry
somewhat
i
found
it
a
hard
thing
to
look
at
happiness
through
another
man
eyes
i
drove
captain
carey
and
johanna
home
along
the
low
level
shore
which
i
had
so
often
traversed
with
my
heart
full
of
olivia
it
was
dusk
the
dusk
of
a
summer
night
but
the
sea
was
luminous
and
sark
lay
upon
it
a
bank
of
silent
darkness
sleeping
to
the
music
of
the
waves
a
strong
yearning
came
over
me
a
longing
to
know
immediately
the
fate
of
my
olivia
would
to
heaven
she
could
return
to
sark
and
be
cradled
there
in
its
silent
and
isolated
dells
would
to
heaven
this
huge
load
of
anxiety
and
care
for
her
which
bowed
me
down
might
be
taken
away
altogether
a
fortnight
longer
i
said
to
myself
and
tardif
will
know
where
she
is
then
i
can
take
measures
for
her
tranquillity
and
safety
in
the
future
it
was
well
for
me
that
i
had
slept
during
my
passage
for
i
had
little
sleep
during
that
night
twice
i
was
aroused
by
the
voice
of
captain
carey
at
my
door
inquiring
what
the
london
time
was
and
if
i
could
rely
upon
my
watch
not
having
stopped
at
four
he
insisted
upon
everybody
in
the
house
getting
up
the
ceremony
was
to
be
solemnized
at
seven
for
the
from
jersey
to
england
was
due
in
guernsey
at
nine
and
there
were
no
other
means
of
quitting
the
island
later
in
the
day
under
these
circumstances
there
could
be
no
formal
a
matter
not
much
to
be
regretted
there
would
not
be
too
much
time
so
johanna
said
for
the
bride
to
change
her
at
her
own
house
for
a
suitable
and
the
rest
of
the
day
would
be
our
own
captain
carey
and
i
were
standing
at
the
altar
of
the
old
church
some
minutes
before
the
bridal
procession
appeared
he
looked
pale
but
wound
up
to
a
high
pitch
of
resolute
courage
the
church
was
nearly
full
of
eager
spectators
all
of
whom
i
had
known
from
my
childhood
faces
that
would
have
crowded
about
me
had
i
been
standing
in
the
place
far
back
half
sheltered
by
a
pillar
i
saw
the
white
head
and
handsome
face
of
my
father
with
kate
daltrey
by
his
side
but
though
the
church
was
so
full
nobody
had
entered
the
same
pew
his
name
had
not
been
once
mentioned
in
my
hearing
as
far
as
his
old
circle
in
guernsey
was
concerned
dobrée
was
dead
at
length
julia
appeared
pale
like
the
bridegroom
but
dignified
and
prepossessing
she
did
not
glance
at
me
she
evidently
gave
no
thought
to
me
that
was
well
and
as
it
should
be
if
any
fancy
had
been
lingering
in
my
head
that
she
still
regretted
somewhat
the
exchange
she
had
made
that
fancy
vanished
forever
julia
expression
when
captain
carey
drew
her
hand
through
his
arm
and
led
her
down
the
aisle
to
the
vestry
was
one
of
unmixed
contentment
yet
there
was
a
pang
in
it
reason
as
i
would
there
was
a
pang
in
it
for
me
i
should
have
liked
her
to
glance
once
at
me
with
a
troubled
and
dimmed
eye
i
should
have
liked
a
shade
upon
her
face
as
i
wrote
my
name
below
hers
in
the
register
but
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
she
gave
me
the
kiss
which
i
demanded
as
her
cousin
martin
without
embarrassment
and
after
that
she
put
her
hand
again
upon
the
bridegroom
arm
and
marched
off
with
him
to
the
carriage
a
whole
host
of
us
accompanied
the
bridal
pair
to
the
pier
and
saw
them
start
off
on
their
with
a
pyramid
of
bouquets
before
them
on
the
deck
of
the
steamer
we
ran
round
to
the
and
waved
out
hats
and
handkerchiefs
as
long
as
they
were
in
sight
that
duty
done
the
rest
of
the
day
was
our
own
chapter
the
a
telegram
in
patois
what
a
long
day
it
was
how
the
hours
seemed
to
double
themselves
and
creep
along
at
the
slowest
pace
they
could
i
had
had
some
hope
of
running
over
to
sark
to
see
tardif
but
that
could
not
be
i
was
needed
too
much
by
the
party
that
had
been
left
behind
by
captain
carey
and
julia
we
tried
to
while
away
the
time
by
a
drive
round
the
island
and
by
visiting
many
of
my
old
favorite
haunts
but
i
could
not
be
myself
everybody
rallied
me
on
my
want
of
spirits
but
i
found
it
impossible
to
shake
off
my
depression
i
was
glad
when
the
day
was
over
and
johanna
and
i
were
left
in
the
quiet
secluded
house
in
the
vale
where
the
moan
of
the
sea
sighed
softly
through
the
night
air
this
has
been
a
trying
day
for
you
martin
said
johanna
yes
i
answered
though
i
can
hardly
account
for
my
own
depression
johanna
in
another
fortnight
i
shall
learn
where
olivia
is
i
want
to
find
a
home
for
her
just
think
of
her
desolate
position
she
has
no
friends
but
tardif
and
me
and
you
know
how
the
world
would
talk
if
i
were
too
openly
her
friend
indeed
i
do
not
wish
her
to
come
to
live
in
london
the
trial
would
be
too
great
for
me
i
could
not
resist
the
desire
to
see
her
to
speak
to
her
and
that
would
be
fatal
to
her
dearest
johanna
i
want
such
a
home
as
this
for
her
johanna
made
no
reply
and
i
could
not
see
her
face
in
the
dim
moonlight
which
filled
the
room
i
knelt
down
beside
her
to
urge
my
petition
more
earnestly
your
name
would
be
such
a
protection
to
her
i
went
on
this
house
such
a
refuge
if
my
mother
were
living
i
would
ask
her
to
receive
her
you
have
been
almost
as
good
to
me
as
my
mother
save
me
save
olivia
from
the
difficulty
i
see
before
us
will
you
never
get
over
this
unfortunate
affair
she
asked
half
angrily
never
i
said
olivia
is
so
dear
to
me
that
i
am
afraid
of
harming
her
by
my
love
save
her
from
me
johanna
you
have
it
in
your
power
i
should
be
happy
if
i
knew
she
was
here
with
you
i
implore
you
for
my
mother
sake
to
receive
olivia
into
your
home
she
shall
come
to
me
said
johanna
after
a
few
minutes
silence
i
was
satisfied
though
the
consent
was
given
with
a
sigh
i
knew
that
before
long
johanna
would
be
profoundly
attached
to
my
olivia
it
was
almost
midnight
the
next
day
when
i
reached
brook
street
where
i
found
jack
expecting
my
return
he
had
bought
in
honor
of
it
some
cigars
of
special
quality
over
which
i
was
to
tell
him
all
the
story
of
julia
wedding
but
a
letter
was
waiting
for
me
directed
in
queer
crabbed
handwriting
and
posted
in
jersey
a
week
before
it
had
been
so
long
on
the
road
in
consequence
of
the
bad
penmanship
of
the
address
i
opened
it
carelessly
as
i
answered
jack
first
inquiries
but
the
instant
i
saw
the
signature
i
held
up
my
hand
to
silence
him
it
was
from
tardif
this
is
a
translation
dear
doctor
and
friend
this
day
i
received
a
letter
from
quite
a
little
letter
with
only
a
few
lines
in
it
she
says
to
me
my
husband
has
found
me
he
is
here
i
have
no
friends
but
you
and
one
other
and
i
can
not
send
for
him
you
said
you
would
come
to
me
whenever
i
wanted
you
i
have
not
time
to
write
more
i
am
in
a
little
village
called
between
granville
and
noireau
come
to
the
house
of
the
curé
i
am
there
behold
i
am
gone
dear
monsieur
i
write
this
in
my
boat
for
we
are
crossing
to
jersey
to
catch
the
steamboat
to
granville
evening
i
shall
be
in
will
you
learn
the
law
of
france
about
this
affair
they
say
the
code
binds
a
woman
to
follow
her
husband
wherever
he
goes
at
london

can
learn
any
thing

say

the
loss
of
my
life

soon
as
you

this
there
will
be
an
inn
at
direct
to
me
there
take
courage
monsieur
your
devoted
tardif
i
must
go
i
exclaimed
starting
to
my
feet
about
to
rush
out
of
the
house
where
cried
jack
catching
my
arm
between
both
his
hands
and
holding
me
fast
to
olivia
i
answered
that
villain
that
scoundrel
has
hunted
her
out
in
normandy
read
that
jack
let
me
go
stay
he
said
there
is
no
chance
of
going
so
late
as
this
it
is
after
twelve
let
us
think
a
few
minutes
and
look
at
bradshaw
but
at
that
moment
a
furious
peal
of
the
bell
rang
through
the
house
we
both
ran
into
the
hall
the
servant
had
just
opened
the
door
and
a
stood
on
the
steps
with
a
telegram
which
he
thrust
into
his
hands
it
was
directed
to
me
i
tore
it
open
from
jean
grimont
granville
to
dobrée
brook
street
london
i
did
not
know
any
jean
grimont
of
granville
it
was
the
name
of
a
stranger
to
me
a
message
was
written
underneath
in
norman
but
so
mispelt
and
garbled
in
its
transmission
that
i
could
not
make
out
the
sense
of
it
the
only
words
i
was
sure
about
were
foster
tardif
and
who
was
on
the
point
of
death
i
could
not
tell
chapter
the
first
olivia
justification
i
know
that
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
i
was
guilty
of
a
great
fault
a
fault
so
grave
that
society
condemns
it
bitterly
how
shall
i
justify
myself
before
those
who
believe
a
woman
owes
her
whole
self
to
her
husband
whatever
his
conduct
to
her
may
be
that
is
impossible
to
them
i
merely
plead
guilty
and
say
nothing
of
extenuating
circumstances
but
there
are
others
who
will
listen
and
be
sorry
for
me
there
are
women
like
johanna
carey
who
will
pity
me
and
lay
the
blame
where
it
ought
to
lie
i
was
little
more
than
seventeen
when
i
was
married
as
mere
a
child
as
any
simple
innocent
girl
of
seventeen
among
you
i
knew
nothing
of
what
life
was
or
what
possibilities
of
happiness
or
misery
it
contained
i
married
to
set
away
from
a
home
that
had
been
happy
but
which
had
become
miserable
this
was
how
it
was
my
own
mother
died
when
i
was
too
young
a
child
to
feel
her
loss
for
many
years
after
that
my
father
and
i
lived
alone
together
on
one
of
the
great
of
adelaide
which
belonged
to
him
and
where
he
made
all
the
fortune
that
he
left
me
a
very
happy
life
very
free
with
no
trammels
of
society
and
no
fetters
of
custom
a
simple
rustic
life
which
gave
me
no
preparation
for
the
years
that
came
after
it
when
i
was
thirteen
my
father
married
again
for
my
sake
and
mine
only
i
knew
afterward
that
he
was
already
foreseeing
his
death
and
feared
to
leave
me
alone
in
the
colony
he
thought
his
second
wife
would
be
a
mother
to
me
at
the
age
when
i
most
needed
one
he
died
two
years
after
leaving
me
to
her
care
he
died
more
peacefully
than
he
could
have
done
because
of
that
this
he
said
to
me
the
very
last
day
of
his
life
ah
i
trust
the
dead
do
not
know
the
troubles
that
come
to
the
living
it
would
have
troubled
my
father
nay
it
would
have
been
anguish
to
him
even
in
heaven
itself
if
he
could
have
seen
my
life
after
he
was
gone
it
is
no
use
talking
or
thinking
about
it
after
two
wretched
years
i
was
only
too
glad
to
be
married
and
get
away
from
the
woman
who
owed
almost
the
duty
of
a
mother
to
me
richard
foster
was
a
nephew
of
my
the
only
man
i
was
allowed
to
see
he
was
almost
twice
my
age
but
he
had
pleasant
manners
and
a
smooth
smooth
tongue
i
believed
he
loved
me
he
swore
it
so
often
and
so
earnestly
and
i
was
in
sore
need
of
love
i
wanted
some
one
to
take
care
of
me
and
think
of
me
and
comfort
me
as
my
father
had
been
used
to
do
so
much
alone
so
desolate
i
had
been
since
his
death
no
one
caring
whether
i
were
happy
or
miserable
ill
or
well
that
i
felt
grateful
to
richard
foster
when
he
said
he
loved
me
he
seemed
to
come
in
my
father
stead
and
my
urged
and
hurried
on
our
marriage
and
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
doing
the
trustees
who
had
charge
of
my
property
left
me
to
the
care
of
my
father
widow
that
was
how
i
came
to
marry
him
when
i
was
only
a
girl
of
seventeen
with
no
knowledge
of
the
world
but
what
i
had
learned
on
my
father
it
was
a
horrible
shameful
thing
if
you
will
only
think
of
it
there
was
i
an
ignorant
unconscious
bewildered
girl
with
the
film
of
childhood
over
my
eyes
still
and
there
was
he
a
crafty
unprincipled
adventurer
who
was
in
love
with
my
fortune
not
with
me
as
quickly
as
he
could
carry
me
off
from
my
home
and
return
to
his
own
haunts
in
europe
he
brought
me
away
from
the
colony
where
all
whom
i
could
ever
call
friends
were
living
i
was
utterly
alone
with
him
at
his
mercy
there
was
not
an
ear
that
i
could
whisper
a
complaint
to
not
one
face
that
would
look
at
me
in
pity
and
compassion
my
father
had
been
a
good
man
and
chivalrous
this
man
laughed
at
all
honor
and
conscience
scornfully
i
can
not
tell
you
the
shock
and
horror
of
it
i
had
not
known
there
were
such
places
and
such
people
in
the
world
until
i
was
thrust
suddenly
into
the
midst
of
them
innocent
at
first
like
the
child
i
was
but
the
film
soon
passed
away
from
my
eyes
i
grew
to
loathe
myself
as
well
as
him
how
would
an
angel
feel
who
was
forced
to
go
down
to
hell
and
become
like
the
lost
creatures
there
remembering
all
the
time
the
undefiled
heaven
he
was
banished
from
i
was
no
angel
but
i
had
been
a
simple
unsullied
girl
and
i
found
myself
linked
in
association
with
men
and
women
such
as
frequent
the
on
the
continent
for
we
lived
upon
the
continent
going
from
one
to
another
how
was
a
girl
like
me
to
possess
her
own
soul
and
keep
it
pure
when
it
belonged
to
a
man
like
richard
foster
there
was
one
more
injury
and
degradation
for
me
to
suffer
i
recollect
the
first
moment
i
saw
the
woman
who
wrought
me
so
much
misery
afterward
we
were
staying
in
homburg
for
a
few
weeks
at
a
hotel
and
she
was
seated
at
a
little
table
in
a
window
not
far
from
the
one
where
we
were
sitting
a
handsome
arrogant
woman
they
had
known
one
another
years
before
it
seemed
he
said
she
was
his
cousin
he
left
me
to
go
and
speak
to
her
and
i
watched
them
though
i
did
not
know
then
that
any
thing
more
would
come
of
it
than
a
casual
acquaintance
i
saw
his
face
grow
animated
and
his
eyes
look
into
hers
with
an
expression
that
stirred
something
like
jealousy
within
me
if
jealousy
can
exist
without
love
when
he
returned
to
me
he
told
me
he
had
invited
her
to
join
us
as
my
companion
she
came
to
us
that
evening
she
never
left
us
after
that
i
was
too
young
he
said
to
be
left
alone
in
foreign
towns
while
he
was
attending
to
his
business
and
his
cousin
would
be
the
most
suitable
person
to
take
care
of
me
i
hated
the
woman
instinctively
she
was
civil
to
me
just
at
first
but
soon
there
was
open
war
between
us
at
which
he
laughed
only
finding
amusement
for
himself
in
my
fruitless
efforts
to
get
rid
of
her
after
a
while
i
discovered
it
could
only
be
by
setting
myself
free
from
him
now
judge
me
tell
me
what
i
was
bound
to
do
three
voices
i
hear
speak
one
says
you
a
poor
hasty
girl
very
weak
yet
innocent
ought
to
have
remained
in
the
slough
losing
day
by
day
your
purity
your
worth
your
nobleness
till
you
grew
like
your
companions
you
had
vowed
ignorantly
with
a
profound
ignorance
it
might
be
to
obey
and
honor
this
man
till
death
parted
you
you
had
no
right
to
break
that
vow
another
says
you
should
have
made
of
yourself
a
spy
you
should
have
laid
traps
you
should
have
gathered
up
every
scrap
of
evidence
you
could
find
against
them
that
might
have
freed
you
in
a
court
of
law
a
third
says
it
was
right
for
you
for
the
health
of
your
soul
and
the
deliverance
of
your
whole
self
from
an
intolerable
bondage
to
break
the
vow
and
take
refuge
in
flight
no
soul
can
be
bound
irrevocably
to
another
for
its
own
hurt
and
ruin
i
listened
then
as
i
should
listen
now
to
the
third
voice
the
chance
came
to
me
just
before
i
was
they
were
bent
upon
extorting
from
me
that
portion
of
my
father
property
which
would
come
to
me
and
be
solely
in
my
own
power
when
i
came
of
age
it
had
been
settled
upon
me
in
such
a
way
that
if
i
were
married
my
husband
could
not
touch
it
without
my
consent
i
must
make
this
quite
clear
of
my
fortune
was
so
settled
that
i
myself
could
not
take
any
portion
of
it
save
the
interest
but
the
other
were
absolutely
mine
whether
i
was
married
or
single
by
locking
up
my
father
had
sought
to
provide
against
the
possibility
of
my
ever
being
reduced
to
poverty
the
rest
was
my
own
to
keep
if
i
pleased
to
give
up
to
my
husband
if
i
pleased
at
first
they
tried
what
fair
words
and
flattery
would
do
with
me
then
they
changed
their
tactics
they
brought
me
over
to
london
where
not
a
creature
knew
me
they
made
me
a
prisoner
in
dull
dreary
rooms
where
i
had
no
employment
and
no
resources
that
is
the
woman
did
it
my
husband
after
settling
us
in
a
house
in
london
disappeared
and
i
saw
no
more
of
him
i
know
now
he
wished
to
keep
himself
irresponsible
for
my
imprisonment
she
would
have
been
the
had
any
legal
difficulties
arisen
he
was
anxious
to
retain
all
his
rights
over
me
i
can
see
how
subtle
he
was
though
my
life
was
a
daily
torture
there
was
positively
nothing
i
could
put
into
words
against
him
nothing
that
would
have
authorized
me
to
seek
a
legal
separation
i
did
not
know
any
thing
of
the
laws
how
should
i
except
the
fact
which
he
dinned
into
my
ears
that
he
could
compel
me
to
live
with
him
but
i
know
now
that
the
best
friends
in
the
world
could
not
have
saved
me
from
him
in
any
other
way
than
the
one
i
took
he
kept
within
the
letter
of
the
law
he
forfeited
no
atom
of
his
claim
upon
me
then
god
took
me
by
the
hand
and
led
me
into
a
peaceful
and
untroubled
refuge
until
i
had
gathered
strength
again
chapter
the
second
on
the
wing
again
how
should
i
see
that
martin
dobrée
was
falling
in
love
with
me
i
was
blind
to
it
strangely
blind
those
wise
people
will
think
who
say
a
woman
always
knows
when
a
man
loves
her
i
knew
so
well
that
all
my
life
was
shut
out
from
the
ordinary
hopes
and
prospects
of
girlhood
that
i
never
realized
the
fact
that
to
him
i
was
a
young
girl
whom
he
might
love
honorably
were
he
once
set
free
from
his
engagement
to
his
cousin
julia
i
had
not
looked
for
any
trouble
of
that
kind
he
had
been
as
kind
to
me
as
any
brother
could
have
been
kind
and
chivalrous
and
considerate
the
first
time
i
saw
him
i
was
weak
and
worn
out
with
great
pain
and
my
mind
seemed
wandering
his
face
came
suddenly
and
distinctly
before
me
a
pleasant
face
though
neither
handsome
nor
regular
in
features
it
possessed
great
vivacity
and
movement
changing
readily
and
always
full
of
expression
he
looked
at
me
so
earnestly
and
compassionately
his
dark
eyes
seeming
to
search
for
the
pain
i
was
suffering
that
i
felt
perfect
confidence
in
him
at
once
i
was
vaguely
conscious
of
his
close
attendance
and
unremitting
care
during
the
whole
week
that
i
lay
all
this
placed
us
on
very
pleasant
terms
of
familiarity
and
friendship
how
grieved
i
was
when
this
friendship
came
to
an
end
when
he
confessed
his
unfortunate
love
to
me
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
such
a
thought
had
never
crossed
my
mind
not
until
i
saw
the
expression
on
his
face
when
he
called
to
us
from
the
shore
to
wait
for
him
and
waded
eagerly
through
the
water
to
us
and
held
my
hands
fast
as
i
helped
him
into
the
boat
not
till
then
did
i
suspect
his
secret
poor
martin
then
there
came
the
moment
when
i
was
compelled
to
say
to
him
i
was
married
four
years
ago
and
my
husband
is
still
living
a
very
bitter
moment
to
me
perhaps
more
bitter
than
to
him
i
knew
we
must
see
one
another
no
more
and
i
who
was
so
poor
in
friends
lost
the
dearest
of
them
by
those
words
that
was
a
great
shock
to
me
but
the
next
day
came
the
second
shock
of
meeting
kate
daltrey
my
husband
martin
had
told
me
that
there
was
a
person
in
guernsey
who
had
traced
my
flight
so
far
but
in
my
trouble
and
sorrow
for
him
i
had
not
thought
much
of
this
intelligence
i
saw
in
an
instant
that
i
had
lost
all
again
my
safety
my
home
my
new
friends
i
must
flee
once
more
alone
and
unaided
leaving
no
trace
behind
me
when
old
mother
renouf
whom
tardif
had
set
to
watch
me
for
very
fear
of
this
mischance
had
led
me
away
from
kate
daltrey
to
the
cottage
i
sought
out
tardif
at
once
he
was
down
at
the
water
edge
mending
his
boat
which
lay
with
its
keel
upward
he
heard
my
footsteps
among
the
pebbles
and
turned
round
to
greet
me
with
one
of
his
grave
smiles
which
had
never
failed
me
whenever
i
went
to
him
is
triste
he
said
is
there
any
thing
i
can
do
for
you
i
must
go
away
from
here
tardif
i
answered
with
a
choking
voice
a
change
swept
quickly
across
his
face
but
he
passed
his
hand
for
a
moment
over
it
and
then
regarded
me
again
with
his
grave
smile
for
what
reason
he
asked
oh
i
must
tell
you
every
thing
i
cried
tell
me
every
thing
he
repeated
it
shall
be
buried
here
in
my
heart
as
if
it
was
buried
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
i
will
try
not
to
think
of
it
even
if
you
bid
me
i
am
your
friend
as
well
as
your
servant
then
leaning
against
his
boat
for
i
could
not
control
my
trembling
i
told
him
almost
all
about
my
wretched
life
from
which
god
had
delivered
me
leading
me
to
him
for
shelter
and
comfort
he
listened
with
his
eyes
cast
down
never
once
raising
them
to
my
face
and
in
perfect
silence
except
that
once
or
twice
he
groaned
within
himself
and
clinched
his
hard
hands
together
i
know
that
i
could
never
have
told
my
history
to
any
other
man
as
i
told
it
to
him
a
homely
peasant
and
fisherman
but
with
as
noble
and
gentle
a
heart
as
ever
beat
you
must
go
he
said
when
i
had
finished
his
voice
was
hollow
and
broken
but
the
words
were
spoken
distinctly
enough
for
me
to
hear
them
yes
there
is
no
help
for
me
i
answered
there
is
no
rest
for
me
but
death
it
would
be
better
to
die
he
said
solemnly
than
return
to
a
life
like
that
i
would
sooner
bury
you
up
yonder
in
our
little
graveyard
than
give
you
up
to
your
husband
you
will
help
me
to
get
away
at
once
i
asked
at
once
he
repeated
in
the
same
broken
voice
his
face
looked
gray
and
his
mouth
twitched
he
leaned
against
his
boat
as
if
he
could
hardly
stand
as
i
was
doing
myself
for
i
felt
utterly
weak
and
shaken
how
soon
i
asked
i
will
row
you
to
guernsey
in
time
for
the
packet
to
england
he
answered
mon
dieu
how
little
i
thought
what
i
was
mending
my
boat
for
is
there
nothing
nothing
in
the
world
i
can
do
for
you
nothing
tardif
i
said
sorrowfully
nothing
he
assented
dropping
his
head
down
upon
his
hands
no
there
was
positively
nothing
he
could
do
for
me
there
was
no
person
on
the
face
of
the
earth
who
could
help
me
my
poor
tardif
i
said
laying
my
hand
on
his
shoulder
i
am
a
great
trouble
to
you
i
can
not
bear
to
let
you
go
in
this
way
he
replied
without
looking
up
if
it
had
been
to
marry
martin
why
then
but
you
have
to
go
alone
poor
little
child
yes
i
said
alone
after
that
we
were
both
silent
for
some
minutes
we
could
hear
the
peaceful
lapping
of
the
water
at
our
feet
and
its
boom
against
the
rocks
and
the
shrieking
of
the
but
there
was
utter
silence
between
us
two
i
felt
as
if
it
would
break
my
heart
to
leave
this
place
and
go
whither
i
knew
not
yet
there
was
no
alternative
tardif
i
said
at
last
i
will
go
first
to
london
it
is
so
large
a
place
nobody
will
find
me
there
besides
they
would
never
think
of
me
going
back
to
london
when
i
am
there
i
will
try
to
get
a
situation
as
governess
somewhere
i
could
teach
little
children
and
if
i
go
into
a
school
there
will
be
no
one
to
fall
in
love
with
me
like
martin
i
am
very
sorry
for
him
sorry
for
him
repeated
tardif
yes
very
sorry
i
replied
it
is
as
if
i
must
bring
trouble
everywhere
you
are
troubled
and
i
can
not
help
it
i
have
only
had
one
trouble
as
great
he
said
as
if
to
himself
and
that
was
when
my
poor
little
wife
died
i
wish
to
god
i
could
keep
you
here
in
safety
but
that
is
impossible
quite
impossible
i
answered
yet
it
seemed
too
bad
to
be
true
what
had
i
done
to
be
driven
away
from
this
quiet
little
home
into
the
cold
wide
world
poor
and
friendless
after
all
my
father
plans
and
precautions
to
secure
me
from
poverty
and
friendlessness
what
was
to
be
my
lot
in
that
dismal
future
over
the
rough
threshold
of
which
i
must
cross
tardif
and
i
talked
it
all
over
that
evening
sitting
at
the
until
the
last
gleam
of
daylight
had
faded
from
the
sky
he
had
some
money
in
hand
just
then
which
he
had
intended
to
invest
the
next
time
he
went
to
guernsey
and
could
see
his
notary
this
money
thirty
pounds
he
urged
me
to
accept
as
a
gift
but
i
insisted
upon
leaving
with
him
my
watch
and
chain
in
pledge
until
i
could
repay
the
money
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
i
could
do
that
i
knew
for
i
was
resolved
never
to
return
to
richard
foster
and
to
endure
any
privation
rather
than
claim
my
property
i
left
tardif
after
a
while
to
pack
up
my
very
few
possessions
we
did
not
tell
his
mother
that
i
was
going
for
he
said
it
would
be
better
not
in
the
morning
he
would
simply
let
her
know
i
was
going
over
to
guernsey
no
communication
had
ever
passed
between
the
old
woman
and
me
except
by
signs
yet
i
should
miss
even
her
in
that
cold
careless
crowd
in
which
i
was
about
to
be
lost
in
the
streets
of
london
we
started
at
four
in
the
morning
while
the
gray
sky
was
dappled
over
with
soft
clouds
and
the
sea
itself
seemed
waking
up
from
sleep
as
if
it
too
had
been
slumbering
through
the
night
the
morning
mist
upon
the
cliffs
made
them
look
mysterious
as
if
they
had
some
secrets
to
conceal
untrodden
tracks
climbed
the
surface
of
the
rocks
and
were
lost
in
the
fine
filmy
haze
the
water
looked
white
and
milky
with
lines
across
it
like
the
tracks
on
the
cliffs
which
no
human
foot
could
tread
and
the
tide
was
coming
back
to
the
shore
with
a
low
tranquil
yet
sad
moan
the
skimmed
past
us
with
their
white
wings
almost
touching
us
their
plaintive
wailing
seeming
to
warn
us
of
the
treachery
and
sorrow
of
the
sea
i
was
not
afraid
of
the
treachery
of
the
sea
yet
i
could
not
bear
to
hear
them
nor
could
tardif
we
landed
at
one
of
the
stone
staircases
running
up
the
side
of
the
pier
at
guernsey
for
we
were
only
just
in
time
for
the
steamer
the
steps
were
slimy
and
wet
with
seaweed
but
tardif
hand
grasped
mine
firmly
he
pushed
his
way
through
the
crowd
of
idlers
who
were
watching
the
lading
of
the
cargo
and
took
me
down
immediately
into
the
cabin
he
said
i
must
leave
you
send
for
me
or
come
to
me
if
you
are
in
trouble
and
i
can
do
any
thing
for
you
if
it
were
to
australia
i
would
follow
you
i
know
i
am
only
fit
to
be
your
servant
but
all
the
same
i
am
your
friend
you
have
a
little
regard
for
me
o
tardif
i
sobbed
i
love
you
very
dearly
now
that
makes
me
glad
he
said
holding
my
hand
between
his
and
looking
down
at
me
with
tears
in
his
eyes
you
said
that
from
your
good
heart
when
i
am
out
alone
in
my
boat
i
shall
think
of
it
and
in
the
long
winter
nights
by
the
fire
when
there
is
no
little
to
come
and
talk
to
me
i
shall
say
to
myself
loves
you
very
dearly
god
be
with
you
and
protect
you
i
said
with
a
sore
grief
in
my
heart
tardif
it
is
very
dreadful
to
be
alone
again
there
was
no
time
to
say
more
for
a
bell
rang
loudly
on
deck
and
we
heard
the
cry
all
friends
on
shore
tardif
put
his
lips
to
my
hand
and
left
me
i
was
indeed
alone
chapter
the
third
in
london
lodgings
once
more
i
found
myself
in
london
a
city
so
strange
to
me
that
i
did
not
know
the
name
of
any
street
in
it
i
had
more
acquaintance
with
almost
every
great
city
on
the
continent
fortunately
tardif
had
given
me
the
address
of
a
or
rather
a
small
family
hotel
where
he
had
stayed
two
or
three
times
and
i
drove
there
at
once
it
was
in
a
quiet
back
street
within
sound
of
paul
clock
the
hour
was
so
late
nearly
midnight
that
i
was
looked
upon
with
suspicion
as
a
young
woman
travelling
alone
and
with
little
luggage
it
was
only
when
i
mentioned
tardif
whose
island
bearing
had
made
him
noticeable
among
the
stream
of
strangers
passing
through
the
house
that
the
mistress
of
the
place
consented
to
take
me
in
this
was
my
first
difficulty
but
not
the
last
by
the
advice
of
the
mistress
of
the
i
went
to
several
governess
agencies
which
were
advertising
for
teachers
in
the
daily
papers
at
most
of
these
they
would
not
even
enter
my
name
as
soon
as
i
confessed
my
inability
to
give
one
or
two
references
to
persons
who
would
vouch
for
my
general
character
and
my
qualifications
this
was
a
fatal
impediment
and
one
that
had
never
occurred
to
me
yet
the
request
was
a
reasonable
one
even
essential
what
could
be
more
suspicious
than
a
girl
of
my
age
without
a
friend
to
give
a
guarantee
of
her
respectability
there
seemed
no
hope
whatever
of
my
entering
into
the
ranks
of
governesses
when
a
fortnight
had
passed
with
no
opening
for
me
i
felt
it
necessary
to
leave
the
which
had
been
my
temporary
home
i
must
economize
my
funds
for
i
did
not
know
how
long
i
must
make
them
hold
out
wandering
about
the
least
fashionable
suburbs
where
lodgings
would
cost
least
i
found
a
bedroom
in
the
third
story
of
a
house
in
a
tolerably
respectable
street
the
rent
was
six
shillings
a
week
to
be
paid
in
advance
in
this
place
i
entered
upon
a
new
phase
of
life
so
different
from
that
in
sark
that
in
the
delusions
which
solitude
often
brings
i
could
not
always
believe
myself
the
same
person
a
dreamy
solitary
gloomy
life
shut
in
upon
myself
with
no
outlet
for
association
with
my
fellow
creatures
my
window
opened
upon
a
with
a
row
of
houses
standing
opposite
to
it
these
houses
had
been
left
and
were
partly
falling
into
ruin
a
row
of
bare
empty
faced
me
whenever
i
turned
my
wearied
eyes
to
the
scene
without
not
a
sound
or
sign
of
life
was
there
about
them
within
my
room
was
small
and
scantily
furnished
yet
there
was
scarcely
space
enough
for
me
to
move
about
it
there
was
no
table
for
me
to
take
my
meals
at
except
the
top
of
the
crazy
chest
of
drawers
which
served
as
my
one
chair
broken
in
the
back
and
tied
together
with
a
faded
ribbon
was
the
only
seat
except
my
box
which
set
in
a
corner
where
i
could
lean
against
the
wall
made
me
the
most
comfortable
place
for
resting
there
was
a
little
rusty
grate
but
it
was
still
and
there
was
no
need
of
a
fire
a
fire
indeed
would
have
been
insupportable
for
the
sultry
breathless
atmosphere
of
august
with
the
of
its
sun
burning
in
the
narrow
streets
and
close
yards
made
the
temperature
as
parching
as
an
oven
i
panted
for
the
cool
cliffs
and
sweet
fresh
air
of
sark
in
this
feverish
solitude
one
day
dragged
itself
after
another
with
awful
monotony
as
they
passed
by
the
only
change
they
brought
was
that
the
sultry
heat
grew
ever
cooler
and
the
long
days
shorter
the
winter
seemed
inclined
to
set
in
early
and
with
unusual
rigor
for
a
month
before
the
usual
time
fires
became
necessary
i
put
off
lighting
mine
for
fear
of
the
cost
until
my
sunless
little
room
under
the
roof
was
almost
like
an
a
severe
cold
which
made
me
afraid
of
having
to
call
in
a
doctor
compelled
me
to
have
a
fire
and
the
burning
of
it
and
the
necessity
of
tending
it
made
it
like
a
second
person
and
companion
in
the
lonely
place
hour
after
hour
i
sat
in
front
of
it
on
my
box
with
my
elbows
on
my
knees
and
my
chin
in
my
hands
watching
the
changeful
scenery
of
its
embers
and
the
exquisite
motion
of
the
flames
and
the
upward
rolling
of
the
tiny
columns
of
smoke
and
the
fiery
gorgeous
colors
that
came
and
went
with
a
breath
to
see
the
tongues
of
fire
lap
round
the
dull
black
coal
and
run
about
it
and
feel
it
and
kindle
it
with
burning
touches
and
never
quit
it
till
it
was
glowing
and
fervid
and
aflame
like
themselves
that
was
my
sole
occupation
for
hours
together
think
what
a
dreary
life
for
a
young
girl
i
was
as
fond
of
companionship
and
needed
love
as
much
as
any
girl
was
it
strange
that
my
thoughts
dwelt
somewhat
dangerously
upon
the
pleasant
peaceful
days
in
sark
when
i
awoke
in
the
morning
to
a
voiceless
solitary
idle
day
how
could
i
help
thinking
of
martin
dobrée
of
tardif
even
of
old
mother
renouf
with
her
wrinkled
face
and
her
significant
nods
and
becks
martin
dobrée
pleasant
face
would
come
before
me
with
his
eyes
gleaming
so
kindly
under
his
square
forehead
and
his
lips
moving
tremulously
with
every
change
of
feeling
had
he
gone
back
to
his
cousin
julia
again
and
were
they
married
i
ought
not
to
feel
any
sorrow
at
that
thought
his
path
had
run
side
by
side
with
mine
for
a
little
while
but
always
with
a
great
barrier
between
us
and
now
they
had
diverged
and
must
grow
farther
and
farther
apart
never
to
touch
again
yet
how
my
father
would
have
loved
him
had
he
known
him
how
securely
he
would
have
trusted
to
his
care
for
me
but
stop
there
was
folly
and
wickedness
in
thinking
that
way
let
me
make
an
end
of
that
there
was
no
loneliness
like
that
loneliness
twice
a
day
i
exchanged
a
word
or
two
with
the
overworked
drudge
of
a
servant
in
the
house
where
i
lived
but
i
had
no
other
voice
to
speak
to
me
no
wonder
that
my
imagination
sometimes
ran
in
forbidden
and
dangerous
channels
when
i
was
not
thinking
and
dreaming
thus
a
host
of
anxieties
crowded
about
me
my
money
was
melting
away
again
though
slowly
for
i
denied
myself
every
thing
but
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
what
was
to
become
of
me
when
it
was
all
gone
it
was
the
old
question
but
the
answer
was
as
difficult
to
find
as
ever
i
was
ready
for
any
kind
of
work
but
no
chance
of
work
came
to
me
with
neither
work
nor
money
what
was
i
to
do
what
was
to
be
the
end
of
it
chapter
the
fourth
ridley
now
and
then
when
i
ventured
out
into
the
streets
a
panic
would
seize
me
a
dread
unutterably
great
that
i
might
meet
my
husband
amid
the
crowd
i
did
not
even
know
that
he
was
in
london
he
had
always
spoken
of
it
as
a
place
he
detested
his
habits
made
the
free
unconventional
life
upon
the
continent
more
agreeable
to
him
how
he
was
living
now
what
he
was
doing
where
he
was
were
so
many
enigmas
to
me
and
i
did
not
care
to
run
any
risk
in
finding
out
the
answers
to
them
twice
i
passed
the
bank
of
australia
where
very
probably
i
could
have
learned
if
he
was
in
the
same
city
as
myself
but
i
dared
not
do
it
and
as
soon
as
i
knew
how
to
avoid
that
street
i
never
passed
along
it
i
had
been
allowed
to
leave
my
address
with
the
clerk
of
a
large
general
agency
in
the
city
when
i
had
not
been
permitted
to
enter
my
name
in
the
books
for
want
of
a
reference
toward
the
close
of
october
i
received
a
note
from
him
desiring
me
to
call
at
the
office
at
two
the
following
afternoon
without
fail
no
danger
of
my
failing
to
keep
such
an
appointment
i
felt
in
better
spirits
that
night
than
i
had
done
since
i
had
been
driven
from
sark
there
was
an
opening
for
me
a
chance
of
finding
employment
and
i
resolved
beforehand
to
take
it
whatever
it
might
be
it
was
an
agency
for
almost
every
branch
of
employment
not
actually
menial
from
curates
to
and
the
place
of
business
was
a
large
one
there
were
two
entrances
and
two
distinct
compartments
at
the
opposite
ends
of
the
building
but
a
broad
long
counter
ran
the
whole
length
of
it
and
a
person
at
one
end
could
see
the
applicants
at
the
other
as
they
stood
by
the
counter
the
compartment
into
which
i
entered
was
filled
with
a
crowd
of
women
waiting
their
turn
to
transact
their
business
behind
the
counter
were
two
or
three
private
boxes
in
which
employers
might
see
the
candidates
and
question
them
on
the
spot
a
lady
was
at
that
moment
examining
a
governess
in
a
loud
imperious
voice
which
we
could
all
hear
distinctly
my
heart
sank
at
the
idea
of
passing
through
such
a
as
to
my
age
my
personal
history
my
friends
and
a
number
of
particulars
foreign
to
the
question
of
whether
i
was
fit
for
the
work
i
offered
myself
for
at
last
i
heard
the
imperious
voice
say
you
may
go
i
do
not
think
you
will
suit
me
and
a
girl
of
about
my
own
age
came
away
from
the
interview
pale
and
trembling
and
with
tears
stealing
down
her
cheeks
a
second
girl
was
summoned
to
go
through
the
same
ordeal
what
was
i
to
do
if
this
person
unseen
in
her
chamber
of
torture
was
the
lady
i
had
been
summoned
to
meet
it
was
a
miserable
sight
this
crowd
of
poor
women
seeking
work
and
my
spirits
sank
like
lead
a
set
of
mournful
depressed
women
there
was
not
one
i
would
have
chosen
to
be
a
governess
for
my
girls
those
who
were
not
dispirited
were
vulgar
and
a
class
that
wished
to
rise
above
the
position
they
were
fitted
for
by
becoming
teachers
these
were
laughing
loudly
among
themselves
at
the
going
on
so
calmly
within
their
hearing
i
shrank
away
into
a
corner
until
my
turn
to
speak
to
the
busy
clerk
should
come
i
had
a
long
time
to
wart
the
office
clock
pointed
to
three
before
i
caught
the
clerk
eye
and
saw
him
beckon
me
up
to
the
counter
i
had
thrown
back
my
veil
for
here
i
was
perfectly
safe
from
recognition
at
the
other
end
of
the
counter
in
the
compartment
devoted
to
curates
doctors
assistants
and
others
there
stood
a
young
man
in
earnest
consultation
with
another
clerk
he
looked
earnestly
at
me
but
i
was
sure
he
could
not
know
me
miss
ellen
martineau
said
the
clerk
that
was
my
mother
name
and
i
had
adopted
it
for
my
own
feeling
as
if
i
had
some
right
to
it
yes
i
answered
would
you
object
to
go
into
a
french
school
as
governess
he
inquired
not
in
the
least
i
said
eagerly
and
pay
a
small
premium
he
added
how
much
i
asked
my
spirits
falling
again
a
mere
trifle
he
said
about
ten
pounds
or
so
for
twelve
months
you
would
perfect
yourself
in
french
you
know
and
you
would
gain
a
referee
for
the
future
i
must
think
about
it
i
replied
well
there
is
the
address
of
a
lady
who
can
give
you
all
the
particulars
he
said
handing
me
a
written
paper
i
left
the
office
ten
pounds
would
be
more
than
the
half
of
the
little
store
left
to
me
yet
would
it
not
be
wiser
to
secure
a
refuge
and
shelter
for
twelve
months
than
run
the
risk
of
hearing
of
some
other
situation
i
walked
slowly
along
the
street
toward
the
busier
thoroughfares
with
my
head
bent
down
and
my
mind
busy
when
suddenly
a
heavy
hand
was
laid
upon
my
arm
grasping
it
with
crushing
force
and
a
harsh
thick
voice
shouted
triumphantly
in
my
ear
the
devil
i
caught
you
at
last
it
was
like
the
bitterness
of
death
that
chill
and
terror
sweeping
over
me
my
husband
hot
breath
was
upon
my
cheek
and
his
eyes
were
looking
closely
into
mine
but
before
i
could
speak
his
grasp
was
torn
away
from
me
and
he
was
sent
whirling
into
the
middle
of
the
road
i
turned
almost
in
equal
terror
to
see
who
had
thrust
himself
between
us
it
was
the
stranger
whom
i
had
seen
in
the
but
his
face
was
now
dark
with
passion
and
as
my
husband
staggered
back
again
toward
us
his
hand
was
ready
to
thrust
him
away
a
second
time
she
my
wife
he
stammered
trying
to
get
past
the
stranger
to
me
by
this
time
a
knot
of
spectators
had
formed
about
us
and
a
policeman
had
come
up
the
stranger
drew
my
arm
through
his
and
faced
them
defiantly
he
a
drunken
vagabond
he
said
he
has
just
come
out
of
those
this
young
lady
is
no
more
his
wife
than
she
is
mine
and
i
know
no
more
of
her
than
that
she
has
just
come
away
from
office
where
she
has
been
looking
after
a
situation
good
heavens
can
not
a
lady
walk
through
the
streets
of
london
without
being
insulted
by
a
drunken
scoundrel
like
that
will
you
give
him
in
charge
sir
asked
the
policeman
while
richard
foster
was
making
vain
efforts
to
speak
coherently
and
explain
his
claim
upon
me
i
clung
to
the
friendly
arm
that
had
come
to
my
aid
sick
and
almost
speechless
with
fear
shall
i
give
him
in
charge
he
asked
me
i
have
only
just
heard
of
a
situation
i
whispered
unable
to
speak
aloud
and
you
are
afraid
of
losing
it
he
said
i
take
the
fellow
away
policeman
and
lock
him
up
if
you
can
for
being
drunk
and
disorderly
in
the
streets
but
the
lady
wo
give
him
in
charge
i
a
good
mind
to
make
him
go
down
on
his
knees
and
beg
her
pardon
do
do
said
two
or
three
voices
in
the
crowd
do
i
whispered
again
oh
take
me
away
quickly
he
cleared
a
passage
for
us
both
with
a
vigor
and
decision
that
there
was
no
resisting
i
glanced
back
for
an
instant
and
saw
my
husband
struggling
with
the
policeman
the
centre
of
the
knot
of
bystanders
from
which
i
was
escaping
he
looked
utterly
unlike
a
gay
prosperous
wealthy
man
with
a
purse
such
as
he
had
used
to
appear
he
was
shabby
and
poor
enough
now
for
the
policeman
to
be
very
hard
upon
him
and
to
prevent
him
from
following
me
the
stranger
kept
my
hand
firmly
on
his
arm
and
almost
carried
me
into
fleet
street
where
in
a
minute
or
two
we
were
quite
lost
in
the
throng
and
i
was
safe
from
all
pursuit
you
are
not
fit
to
go
on
he
said
kindly
come
out
of
the
noise
a
little
he
led
me
down
a
covered
passage
between
two
shops
into
a
quiet
cluster
of
squares
and
gardens
where
only
a
subdued
murmur
of
the
uproar
of
the
streets
reached
us
there
were
a
sufficient
number
of
to
prevent
it
seeming
lonely
but
we
could
hear
our
own
voices
and
those
of
others
even
in
whispers
this
is
the
temple
he
said
smiling
a
fit
place
for
a
sanctuary
i
do
not
know
how
to
thank
you
i
answered
falteringly
you
are
trembling
still
he
replied
how
lucky
it
was
that
i
followed
you
directly
out
of
ridley
if
i
ever
come
across
that
scoundrel
again
i
shall
know
him
you
may
be
sure
i
wish
we
were
a
little
nearer
home
you
should
go
in
to
rest
but
our
house
is
in
brook
street
and
we
have
no
belonging
to
us
my
name
is
john
senior
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
my
father
senior
of
brook
street
no
i
replied
i
know
nobody
in
london
that
bad
he
said
i
wish
i
was
jane
senior
instead
of
john
senior
i
do
indeed
do
you
feel
better
now
miss
martineau
how
do
you
know
my
name
i
asked
the
clerk
at
ridley
called
you
miss
ellen
martineau
he
answered
my
hearing
is
very
good
and
i
was
not
deeply
engrossed
in
my
business
i
heard
and
saw
a
good
deal
while
i
was
there
and
i
am
very
glad
i
heard
and
saw
you
do
you
feel
well
enough
now
for
me
to
see
you
home
oh
i
can
not
let
you
see
me
home
i
said
hurriedly
i
will
do
just
what
you
like
best
he
replied
i
have
no
more
right
to
annoy
you
than
that
drunken
vagabond
had
if
i
did
i
should
be
more
blamable
than
he
was
tell
me
what
i
shall
do
for
you
then
shall
i
call
a
cab
i
hesitated
for
my
funds
were
low
and
would
be
almost
spent
by
the
time
i
had
paid
the
premium
of
ten
pounds
and
my
travelling
expenses
yet
i
dared
not
trust
myself
either
in
the
streets
or
in
an
omnibus
i
saw
my
new
friend
regard
me
keenly
my
dress
so
worn
and
faded
and
my
bonnet
a
smile
flickered
across
his
face
he
led
me
back
into
fleet
street
and
called
an
empty
cab
that
was
passing
by
we
shook
hands
warmly
there
was
no
time
for
loitering
and
i
told
him
the
name
of
the
suburb
where
i
was
living
and
he
repeated
it
to
the
cabman
all
right
he
said
speaking
through
the
window
the
fare
is
paid
and
i
taken
cabby
number
if
he
tries
to
cheat
you
let
me
know
john
senior
brook
street
i
hope
that
situation
will
be
a
good
one
and
very
pleasant
i
cried
leaning
forward
and
looking
at
his
face
till
the
crowd
came
between
us
and
i
lost
sight
of
it
it
was
a
handsomer
face
than
martin
dobrée
and
had
something
of
the
same
genial
vivacious
light
about
it
i
knew
it
well
afterward
but
i
had
not
leisure
to
think
much
of
it
then
chapter
the
fifth
bellringer
street
i
was
still
trembling
with
the
terror
that
my
meeting
with
richard
foster
had
aroused
a
painful
shuddering
agitated
me
and
my
heart
fluttered
with
an
excess
of
fear
which
i
could
not
conquer
i
could
still
feel
his
grasp
upon
my
arm
where
the
skin
was
black
with
the
mark
and
there
was
before
my
eyes
the
sight
of
his
haggard
and
enraged
face
as
he
struggled
to
get
free
from
the
policeman
when
he
was
sober
would
he
recollect
all
that
had
taken
place
and
go
to
make
inquiries
after
me
at
ridley
john
senior
had
said
he
had
followed
me
from
there
i
scarcely
believed
he
would
yet
there
was
a
chance
of
it
a
deadly
chance
to
me
if
so
the
sooner
i
could
fly
from
london
and
england
the
better
i
felt
safer
when
the
cabman
set
me
down
at
the
house
where
i
lodged
and
i
ran
to
my
little
room
i
kindled
the
fire
which
had
gone
out
during
my
absence
and
set
my
little
tin
upon
the
first
clear
flame
which
burned
up
amid
the
coal
then
i
sat
down
on
my
box
before
it
thinking
yes
i
must
leave
london
i
must
take
this
situation
the
only
one
open
to
me
in
a
school
in
france
i
should
at
least
be
assured
of
a
home
for
twelve
months
and
as
the
clerk
had
said
i
should
perfect
myself
in
french
and
gain
a
referee
i
should
be
earning
a
character
in
fact
at
present
i
had
none
and
so
was
poorer
than
the
poorest
no
character
no
name
no
money
who
could
be
poorer
than
the
daughter
of
the
wealthy
colonist
who
had
owned
thousands
of
acres
in
adelaide
i
almost
laughed
and
cried
hysterically
at
the
thought
of
my
father
vain
care
and
provision
for
my
future
but
the
sooner
i
fled
from
london
again
the
better
now
that
i
knew
my
husband
was
somewhere
in
it
and
might
be
upon
my
track
i
unfolded
the
paper
on
which
was
written
the
name
of
the
lady
to
whom
i
was
to
apply
wilkinson
bellringer
street
i
ran
down
to
the
to
ask
my
landlady
where
it
was
and
told
her
in
my
new
hopefulness
that
i
had
heard
of
a
situation
in
france
bellringer
street
was
less
than
a
mile
away
she
said
i
could
be
there
before
seven
not
too
late
perhaps
for
wilkinson
to
give
me
an
interview
a
thick
yellow
fog
had
come
in
with
nightfall
a
fog
that
could
almost
be
tasted
and
smelt
but
it
did
not
deter
me
from
my
object
i
inquired
my
way
of
every
policeman
i
met
and
at
length
entered
the
street
the
fog
hid
the
houses
from
my
view
but
i
could
see
that
some
of
the
lower
windows
were
filled
with
articles
for
sale
as
if
they
were
shops
struggling
into
existence
it
was
not
a
fashionable
street
and
wilkinson
could
not
be
a
very
aristocratic
person
no
was
not
difficult
to
find
and
i
pulled
the
with
a
gentle
and
quiet
pull
befitting
my
errand
i
repeated
this
several
times
without
being
admitted
when
it
struck
me
that
the
wire
might
be
broken
upon
that
i
knocked
as
loudly
as
i
could
upon
the
panels
of
the
broad
old
door
a
handsome
heavy
door
such
as
are
to
be
found
in
the
old
streets
of
london
from
which
the
tide
of
fashion
has
ebbed
away
a
slight
thin
child
in
rusty
mourning
opened
it
with
the
chain
across
and
asked
who
i
was
in
a
timid
voice
does
wilkinson
live
here
i
asked
yes
said
the
child
who
is
there
i
heard
a
voice
calling
shrilly
from
within
not
an
english
voice
i
felt
sure
for
each
word
was
uttered
distinctly
and
slowly
i
am
come
about
a
school
in
france
i
said
to
the
child
oh
i
let
you
in
she
answered
eagerly
she
will
see
you
about
that
i
sure
i
to
go
with
you
if
you
go
she
let
down
the
chain
and
opened
the
door
there
was
a
dim
light
burning
in
the
hall
which
looked
shabby
and
there
was
no
carpet
upon
the
broad
staircase
and
nothing
but
on
the
floor
i
had
only
time
to
take
in
a
vague
general
impression
before
the
little
girl
conducted
me
to
a
room
on
the
that
too
was
uncarpeted
and
barely
furnished
but
the
light
was
low
and
i
could
see
nothing
distinctly
except
the
face
of
the
child
looking
wistfully
at
me
with
shy
curiosity
i
to
go
if
you
go
she
said
again
and
oh
i
do
so
hope
you
will
agree
to
go
i
think
i
shall
i
answered
i
dare
be
sure
she
replied
nodding
her
head
with
an
air
of
sagacity
there
have
been
four
or
five
governesses
here
and
none
of
them
would
go
you
have
to
take
me
with
you
and
oh
it
is
such
a
lovely
beautiful
place
see
here
is
a
picture
of
it
she
ran
eagerly
to
a
on
which
lay
a
book
or
two
one
of
which
she
opened
and
reached
out
a
photograph
which
had
been
laid
there
for
security
when
she
brought
it
to
me
she
stood
leaning
lightly
against
me
as
we
both
looked
at
the
same
picture
it
was
a
clear
photograph
with
shadows
so
dark
yet
distinct
as
to
show
the
clearness
of
the
atmosphere
in
which
it
had
been
taken
at
the
left
hand
stood
a
handsome
house
with
windows
covered
with
lace
curtains
and
provided
with
outer
venetian
shutters
in
the
centre
stood
a
large
square
garden
with
fountains
and
arbors
and
statues
in
the
french
style
of
gardening
evidently
well
kept
and
behind
this
stood
a
long
building
of
two
stories
and
a
steep
roof
with
dormer
windows
every
casement
of
which
was
provided
like
the
house
in
the
front
with
rich
lace
curtains
and
venetian
shutters
the
whole
place
was
clearly
in
good
order
and
good
taste
and
looked
like
a
very
pleasant
home
it
would
probably
be
my
home
for
a
time
and
i
scrutinized
it
the
more
closely
which
of
those
sunny
casements
would
be
mine
what
nook
in
that
garden
would
become
my
favorite
if
i
could
only
get
there
undetected
how
secure
and
happy
i
might
be
above
the
photograph
was
written
in
ornamental
characters
pensionnat
de
demoiselles
à
noireau
calvados
underneath
it
were
the
words
fondé
par
emile
perrier
avocat
et
par
son
épouse
though
i
knew
very
little
of
french
i
could
make
out
the
meaning
of
these
sentences
monsieur
perrier
was
an
tardif
had
happened
to
speak
to
me
about
the
notaries
in
guernsey
who
appeared
to
me
to
be
of
the
same
rank
as
our
solicitors
while
the
were
on
a
par
with
our
barristers
a
barrister
founding
a
for
young
ladies
might
be
somewhat
opposed
to
english
customs
but
it
was
clear
that
he
must
be
a
man
of
education
and
position
a
gentleman
in
fact
is
it
a
lovely
place
asked
the
child
beside
me
with
a
deep
sigh
of
longing
yes
i
said
i
should
like
to
go
i
had
had
time
to
make
all
these
observations
before
the
owner
of
the
foreign
voice
which
i
had
heard
at
the
door
came
in
at
the
first
glance
i
knew
her
to
be
a
frenchwoman
with
the
peculiar
yellow
tone
in
her
skin
which
seems
inevitable
in
frenchwomen
her
black
eyes
were
steady
and
cold
and
her
general
expression
one
of
watchfulness
she
had
wrapped
tightly
about
her
a
china
crape
shawl
which
had
once
been
white
but
had
now
the
same
yellow
tint
as
her
complexion
the
light
was
low
but
she
turned
it
a
little
higher
and
scrutinized
me
with
a
keen
and
steady
gaze
i
have
not
the
honor
of
knowing
you
she
said
politely
i
come
from
ridley
i
answered
about
a
situation
as
english
teacher
in
a
school
in
france
be
seated
miss
she
said
pointing
me
to
a
stiff
chair
whither
the
little
girl
followed
me
stroking
with
her
hand
the
soft
jacket
i
was
wearing
it
is
a
great
chance
she
continued
my
friend
madame
perrier
is
very
good
very
amiable
for
her
teachers
she
is
like
a
sister
for
them
the
terms
are
very
high
very
high
for
france
but
there
is
absolutely
every
comfort
the
arrangements
are
precisely
like
england
she
has
lived
in
england
for
two
years
and
knows
what
english
young
ladies
look
for
and
the
house
is
positively
english
i
suppose
you
could
introduce
a
few
english
pupils
no
i
answered
i
am
afraid
i
could
not
i
am
sure
i
could
not
that
of
course
must
be
considered
in
the
premium
she
continued
if
you
could
have
introduced
say
six
pupils
the
premium
would
be
low
i
do
not
think
my
friend
would
take
one
penny
less
than
twenty
pounds
for
the
first
year
and
ten
for
the
second
the
tears
started
to
my
eyes
i
had
felt
so
sure
of
going
if
i
would
pay
ten
pounds
that
i
was
quite
unprepared
for
this
disappointment
there
was
still
my
diamond
ring
left
but
how
to
dispose
of
it
for
any
thing
like
its
value
i
did
not
know
it
was
in
my
purse
now
with
all
my
small
store
of
money
which
i
dared
not
leave
behind
me
in
my
lodgings
what
were
you
prepared
to
give
asked
wilkinson
while
i
hesitated
the
clerk
at
ridley
office
told
me
the
premium
would
be
ten
pounds
i
answered
i
do
not
see
how
i
can
give
more
well
she
said
after
musing
a
little
while
i
watched
her
face
anxiously
it
is
time
this
child
went
she
has
been
here
a
month
waiting
for
somebody
to
take
her
down
to
noireau
i
will
agree
with
you
and
will
explain
it
to
madame
perrier
how
soon
could
you
go
i
should
like
to
go
i
replied
feeling
that
the
sooner
i
quitted
london
the
better
wilkinson
steady
eyes
fastened
upon
me
again
with
sharp
curiosity
have
you
references
miss
she
asked
no
i
faltered
my
hope
sinking
again
before
this
old
difficulty
it
will
be
necessary
then
she
said
for
you
to
give
the
money
to
me
and
i
will
forward
it
to
madame
perrier
pardon
miss
but
you
perceive
i
could
not
send
a
teacher
to
them
unless
i
knew
that
she
could
pay
the
money
down
there
is
my
commission
to
receive
the
money
for
my
friend
she
gave
me
a
paper
written
in
french
of
which
i
could
read
enough
to
see
that
it
was
a
sort
of
official
warrant
to
receive
accounts
for
monsieur
perrier
and
his
wife
i
did
not
waver
any
longer
the
prospect
seemed
too
promising
for
me
to
lose
it
by
any
irresolution
i
drew
out
my
purse
and
laid
down
two
out
of
the
three
notes
left
me
she
gave
me
a
formal
receipt
in
the
names
of
emile
and
louise
perrier
and
her
sober
face
wore
an
expression
of
satisfaction
there
it
is
done
she
said
wiping
her
pen
carefully
you
will
take
lessons
any
lessons
you
please
from
the
professors
who
attend
the
school
it
is
a
grand
chance
miss
a
grand
chance
let
us
say
you
go
the
day
after
the
child
will
be
quite
ready
she
is
going
for
four
years
to
that
splendid
place
a
place
for
ladies
of
the
highest
degree
at
that
moment
an
imperious
knock
sounded
upon
the
outer
door
and
the
little
girl
ran
to
answer
it
leaving
the
door
of
our
room
open
a
voice
which
i
knew
well
a
voice
which
made
my
heart
stand
still
and
my
veins
curdle
spoke
in
sharp
loud
tones
in
the
hall
is
foster
come
home
yet
were
the
words
the
terrible
voice
uttered
quite
close
to
me
it
seemed
so
close
that
i
shrank
back
shivering
as
if
every
syllable
struck
a
separate
blow
all
my
senses
were
awake
i
could
hear
every
sound
in
the
hall
each
step
that
came
nearer
and
nearer
was
she
about
to
enter
the
room
where
i
was
sitting
she
stood
still
for
half
a
minute
as
if
uncertain
what
to
do
he
is
up
stairs
said
the
child
voice
he
told
me
he
was
ill
when
i
opened
the
door
for
him
where
is
mrs
wilkinson
she
asked
she
is
here
said
the
child
but
there
a
lady
with
her
then
the
woman
footsteps
went
on
up
the
staircase
i
listened
to
them
climbing
up
one
step
after
another
my
brain
throbbing
with
each
sound
and
i
heard
a
door
opened
and
closed
wilkinson
had
gone
to
the
door
and
looked
out
into
the
hall
as
if
expecting
some
other
questions
to
be
asked
she
had
not
seen
my
panic
of
despair
i
must
get
away
before
i
lost
the
use
of
my
senses
for
i
felt
giddy
and
faint
i
will
send
the
child
to
you
in
a
cab
on
wednesday
she
said
as
i
stood
up
and
made
my
way
toward
the
hall
you
have
not
told
me
your
address
i
paused
for
a
moment
dared
i
tell
her
my
address
yet
my
money
was
paid
and
if
i
did
not
i
should
lose
both
it
and
the
refuge
i
had
bought
with
it
besides
i
should
awaken
suspicion
and
inquiry
by
silence
it
was
a
fearful
risk
to
run
yet
it
seemed
safer
than
a
precipitous
retreat
i
gave
her
my
address
and
saw
her
write
it
down
on
a
slip
of
paper
as
i
returned
to
my
lodgings
i
grew
calmer
and
more
hopeful
it
was
not
likely
that
my
husband
would
see
the
address
or
even
hear
that
any
one
like
me
had
been
at
the
house
i
did
not
suppose
he
would
know
the
name
of
martineau
as
my
mother
maiden
name
as
far
as
i
recollected
i
had
never
spoken
of
her
to
him
moreover
he
was
not
a
man
to
make
himself
at
all
pleasant
and
familiar
with
persons
whom
he
looked
upon
as
inferiors
it
was
highly
improbable
that
he
would
enter
into
any
conversation
with
his
landlady
if
that
woman
did
so
all
she
would
learn
would
be
that
a
young
lady
whose
name
was
martineau
had
taken
a
situation
as
english
teacher
in
a
french
school
what
could
there
be
in
that
to
make
her
think
of
me
i
tried
to
soothe
and
reassure
myself
with
these
reasonings
but
i
could
not
be
quiet
or
at
peace
i
watched
all
through
the
next
day
listening
to
every
sound
in
the
house
below
but
no
new
terror
assailed
me
the
second
night
i
was
tranquil
enough
to
sleep
chapter
the
sixth
leaving
england
i
was
on
the
rack
all
the
next
day
it
was
the
last
day
i
should
be
in
england
and
i
had
a
nervous
dread
of
being
detained
if
i
should
once
more
succeed
in
quitting
the
country
undetected
it
seemed
as
though
i
might
hope
to
be
in
safety
in
calvados
of
calvados
i
knew
even
less
than
of
the
channel
islands
i
had
never
heard
the
name
before
but
wilkinson
had
given
me
the
route
by
which
we
were
to
reach
noireau
by
steamer
to
havre
across
the
mouth
of
the
seine
to
honfleur
to
falaise
by
train
and
finally
from
falaise
to
noireau
by
omnibus
it
was
an
utterly
unknown
region
to
me
and
i
had
no
reason
to
imagine
that
richard
foster
was
better
acquainted
with
it
than
i
my
anxiety
was
simply
to
get
clear
away
in
the
afternoon
the
little
girl
arrived
quite
alone
except
that
a
man
had
been
hired
to
carry
a
small
box
for
her
and
to
deliver
her
into
my
charge
this
was
a
great
relief
to
me
and
i
paid
the
shilling
he
demanded
gladly
the
child
was
thinly
and
shabbily
dressed
for
our
long
journey
and
there
was
a
forlorn
loneliness
about
her
position
left
thus
with
a
stranger
which
touched
me
to
the
heart
we
were
alike
poor
helpless
friendless
i
was
about
to
say
childish
and
in
truth
i
was
in
many
things
little
more
than
a
child
still
the
small
elf
with
her
sharp
large
eyes
which
were
too
big
for
her
thin
face
crept
up
to
me
as
the
man
slammed
the
door
after
him
and
clattered
noisily
downstairs
i
so
glad
she
said
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
was
afraid
i
should
never
go
and
school
is
such
a
heavenly
place
the
words
amused
yet
troubled
me
they
were
so
different
from
a
ordinary
opinion
it
such
a
hateful
place
at
wilkinson
she
went
on
everybody
calling
me
at
once
and
scolding
me
and
there
are
such
a
many
people
to
run
errands
for
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
run
errands
when
you
are
tired
to
death
and
it
such
a
beautiful
splendid
place
where
going
to
what
is
your
name
my
dear
i
asked
sitting
down
on
my
box
and
taking
her
on
my
lap
such
a
thin
stunted
little
woman
precociously
learned
in
trouble
yet
she
nestled
in
my
arms
like
a
true
child
and
a
tear
or
two
rolled
down
her
cheeks
as
if
from
very
contentment
nobody
has
nursed
me
like
this
since
mother
died
she
said
mary
but
father
always
called
me
minima
because
i
was
the
least
in
the
house
he
kept
a
boys
school
out
of
london
in
epping
forest
you
know
and
it
was
so
heavenly
all
the
boys
were
good
to
me
and
we
used
to
call
father
dominie
then
he
died
and
mother
died
just
before
him
and
he
said
minima
god
will
take
care
of
my
little
girl
so
the
boys
fathers
and
mothers
made
a
subscription
for
me
and
they
got
a
great
deal
of
money
a
hundred
pounds
and
somebody
told
them
about
this
school
where
i
can
stay
four
years
for
a
hundred
pounds
and
they
all
said
that
was
the
best
thing
they
could
do
with
me
but
i
had
to
stay
with
wilkinson
nearly
two
months
because
she
could
not
find
a
governess
to
go
with
me
i
hate
her
i
detest
her
i
should
like
to
spit
at
her
the
little
face
was
all
aflame
and
the
large
eyes
burning
hush
hush
i
said
drawing
her
head
down
upon
my
shoulder
again
then
there
is
foster
she
continued
almost
sobbing
he
torments
me
so
he
likes
to
make
fun
of
me
and
tease
me
till
i
ca
bear
to
go
into
his
room
father
used
to
say
it
was
wicked
to
hate
anybody
and
i
did
hate
anybody
then
i
was
so
happy
but
you
hate
foster
and
foster
if
you
only
knew
them
why
i
asked
in
a
whisper
my
voice
sounded
husky
to
me
and
my
throat
felt
parched
the
child
impotent
rage
and
hatred
struck
a
slumbering
chord
within
me
oh
they
are
horrid
in
every
way
she
said
with
emphasis
they
frighten
me
he
is
fond
of
tormenting
any
thing
because
he
cruel
we
had
a
cruel
boy
in
our
school
once
so
i
know
but
they
are
very
poor
poor
as
job
wilkinson
says
and
i
glad
are
you
glad
the
question
jarred
in
my
memory
against
a
passionate
craving
after
revenge
which
had
died
away
in
the
quiet
and
tranquillity
of
sark
a
year
ago
i
should
have
rejoiced
in
any
measure
of
punishment
or
retribution
which
had
overtaken
those
who
had
destroyed
my
happiness
but
it
was
not
so
now
or
perhaps
i
should
rather
own
that
it
was
only
faintly
so
it
had
never
occurred
to
me
that
my
flight
would
plunge
him
into
poverty
similar
to
my
own
but
now
that
the
idea
was
thrust
upon
me
i
wondered
how
i
could
have
overlooked
this
necessary
consequence
of
my
conduct
ought
i
to
do
any
thing
for
him
was
there
any
thing
i
could
do
to
help
him
he
is
ill
too
pursued
the
child
i
heard
him
say
once
to
foster
he
knew
he
should
die
like
a
dog
i
was
a
little
tiny
bit
sorry
for
him
then
for
nobody
would
like
to
die
like
a
dog
and
not
go
to
heaven
you
know
but
i
do
care
now
i
shall
never
see
them
again
never
never
i
could
jump
out
of
my
skin
for
joy
i
even
know
when
he
is
dead
if
he
does
die
like
a
dog
ill
dead
my
heart
beat
faster
and
faster
as
i
pondered
over
these
words
then
i
should
be
free
indeed
his
death
would
release
me
from
bondage
from
terror
from
poverty
those
three
evils
which
dogged
my
steps
i
had
never
ventured
to
let
my
thoughts
run
that
way
but
this
child
prattling
had
forced
them
into
it
richard
foster
ill
dying
o
god
what
ought
i
to
do
i
could
not
make
myself
known
to
him
that
was
impossible
i
would
ten
thousand
times
sooner
die
myself
than
return
to
him
he
was
not
alone
either
but
yet
there
came
back
to
my
mind
the
first
days
when
i
knew
him
when
he
was
all
tenderness
and
devotion
to
me
declaring
that
he
could
find
no
fault
in
his
how
happy
i
had
been
for
a
little
while
exchanging
my
stepmother
harshness
for
his
indulgence
he
might
have
won
my
love
he
had
almost
won
it
but
that
happy
golden
time
was
gone
and
could
never
come
back
to
me
yet
my
heart
was
softened
toward
him
as
i
thought
of
him
ill
perhaps
dying
what
could
i
do
for
him
without
placing
myself
in
his
power
there
was
one
thing
only
that
i
could
do
only
one
little
sacrifice
i
could
make
for
him
whom
i
had
vowed
in
childish
ignorance
to
love
honor
and
cherish
in
sickness
and
in
health
until
death
parted
us
a
home
was
secured
to
me
for
twelve
months
and
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
should
have
a
better
career
open
to
me
i
had
enough
money
still
to
last
me
until
then
my
diamond
ring
which
had
been
his
own
gift
to
me
on
our
would
be
valuable
to
him
sixty
pounds
would
be
a
help
to
him
if
he
were
as
poor
as
this
child
said
he
must
be
poor
or
he
would
never
have
gone
to
live
in
that
mean
street
and
neighborhood
perhaps
if
he
had
been
alone
i
do
not
know
but
possibly
if
he
had
been
quite
alone
ill
dying
in
that
poor
lodging
of
his
i
might
have
gone
to
him
i
ask
myself
again
could
you
have
done
this
thing
but
i
can
not
answer
it
even
to
myself
poor
and
ill
he
was
but
he
was
not
alone
it
was
enough
for
me
then
that
i
could
do
something
some
little
service
for
him
the
old
flame
of
vengeance
had
no
spark
of
heat
left
in
it
i
was
free
from
hatred
of
him
i
set
the
child
gently
away
from
me
and
wrote
my
last
letter
to
my
husband
both
the
letter
and
the
ring
i
enclosed
in
a
little
box
these
are
the
words
i
wrote
and
i
put
neither
date
nor
name
of
place
i
know
that
you
are
poor
and
i
send
you
all
i
can
spare
the
ring
you
once
gave
to
me
i
am
even
poorer
than
yourself
but
i
have
just
enough
for
my
immediate
wants
i
forgive
you
as
i
trust
god
forgives
me
i
sat
looking
at
it
thinking
of
it
for
some
time
there
was
a
vague
doubt
somewhere
in
my
mind
that
this
might
work
some
mischief
but
at
last
i
decided
that
it
should
go
i
must
register
the
packet
at
a
on
our
way
to
the
station
and
it
could
not
fail
to
reach
him
this
business
settled
i
returned
to
the
child
who
was
sitting
as
i
had
so
often
done
gazing
pensively
into
the
fire
was
she
to
be
a
sort
of
miniature
copy
of
myself
come
minima
i
said
we
must
be
thinking
of
tea
which
would
you
like
best
buns
or
cake
or
we
must
go
out
and
buy
them
and
you
shall
choose
which
would
cost
the
most
she
asked
looking
at
me
with
the
careworn
expression
of
a
woman
the
question
sounded
so
oddly
coming
from
lips
so
young
that
it
grieved
me
how
bitterly
and
heavily
must
the
burden
of
poverty
have
already
fallen
upon
this
child
i
was
almost
afraid
to
think
what
it
must
mean
i
put
my
arm
round
her
pressing
my
cheek
against
hers
while
childish
visions
more
childish
than
any
in
this
little
head
flitted
before
me
of
pantomimes
and
toys
and
sweetmeats
and
the
thousand
things
that
children
love
if
i
had
been
as
rich
as
my
father
had
planned
for
me
to
be
how
i
would
have
lavished
them
upon
this
anxious
little
creature
we
were
discussing
this
question
with
befitting
gravity
when
a
great
thump
against
the
door
brought
a
host
of
fears
upon
me
but
before
i
could
stir
the
insecure
handle
gave
way
and
no
one
more
formidable
appeared
than
the
landlady
of
the
house
carrying
before
her
a
tray
on
which
was
set
out
a
sumptuous
tea
consisting
of
buttered
crumpets
and
shrimps
she
put
it
down
on
my
and
stood
surveying
it
and
us
with
an
expression
of
benign
exultation
until
she
had
recovered
her
breath
sufficiently
to
speak
those
as
are
going
into
foring
parts
she
said
ought
to
get
a
good
english
meal
afore
they
start
if
you
was
going
to
stay
in
england
miss
it
would
be
quite
a
differing
thing
but
me
and
my
master
know
what
they
may
give
you
to
eat
where
you
going
to
therefore
we
beg
you
accept
of
the
crumpets
and
the
shrimps
and
the
and
the
tea
and
every
thing
and
we
mean
no
offence
by
it
you
been
a
very
quiet
regular
lodger
and
give
no
trouble
and
we
sorry
to
lose
you
and
this
my
master
says
is
a
testimonial
to
you
i
could
hardly
control
my
laughter
and
i
could
not
keep
back
my
tears
it
was
a
long
time
now
since
any
one
had
shown
me
so
much
kindness
and
sympathy
as
this
the
dull
face
of
the
good
woman
was
brightened
by
her
feeling
and
instead
of
thanking
her
i
put
my
lips
to
her
cheek
lor
she
exclaimed
why
god
bless
you
my
dear
i
did
mean
any
offence
you
know
lor
i
never
thought
you
pay
me
like
that
very
pretty
of
you
it
is
for
i
sure
you
a
lady
to
the
backbone
as
often
and
often
i
said
to
my
master
be
good
enough
to
eat
it
all
you
and
the
little
miss
for
you
a
long
journey
before
you
god
bless
you
both
my
dears
and
give
you
a
good
appetite
she
backed
out
of
the
room
as
she
was
speaking
her
face
beaming
upon
us
to
the
last
there
was
a
pleasant
drollery
about
her
conduct
and
about
the
intense
delight
of
the
child
and
her
hearty
enjoyment
of
the
feast
which
for
the
time
effectually
dissipated
my
fears
and
my
melancholy
thoughts
it
was
the
last
hour
i
should
spend
in
my
solitary
room
my
lonely
days
were
past
this
little
elf
with
her
large
sharp
eyes
and
sagacious
womanly
face
was
to
be
my
companion
for
the
future
i
felt
closely
drawn
to
her
even
the
hungry
appetite
with
which
she
ate
spoke
of
the
hard
times
she
had
gone
through
when
she
had
eaten
all
she
could
eat
i
heard
her
say
softly
to
herself
courage
minima
chapter
the
seventh
a
long
journey
it
as
little
more
than
twelve
months
since
i
had
started
from
the
same
station
on
the
same
route
but
there
was
no
tardif
at
hand
now
as
i
went
into
the
minima
caught
me
by
the
dress
and
whispered
earnestly
into
my
ear
we
not
to
travel
she
said
it
costs
too
much
wilkinson
said
we
ought
to
go
third
if
we
could
and
you
to
pay
for
me
please
only
and
they
pay
you
again
when
we
reach
the
school
i
come
with
you
and
then
they
see
i
only
i
do
look
too
old
do
i
you
look
very
old
i
answered
smiling
at
her
anxious
face
oh
dear
dear
she
said
but
i
sit
very
small
perhaps
i
better
not
come
to
the
the
porters
are
sure
to
think
me
only
a
little
girl
she
was
uneasy
until
we
had
fairly
started
from
the
station
her
right
to
a
unchallenged
the
november
night
was
cold
and
foggy
and
there
was
little
difference
between
the
darkness
of
the
suburbs
and
the
darkness
of
the
open
country
once
again
the
black
hulls
and
masts
of
two
steamers
stood
before
us
at
the
end
of
our
journey
and
hurrying
voices
shouted
this
way
for
jersey
and
guernsey
this
way
to
havre
what
would
i
not
have
given
to
return
to
sark
to
my
quiet
room
under
tardif
roof
with
his
true
heart
and
steadfast
friendship
to
rest
upon
but
that
could
not
be
my
feet
were
setting
out
upon
a
new
track
and
i
did
not
know
where
the
hidden
path
would
lead
me
the
next
morning
found
us
in
france
it
was
a
soft
sunny
day
with
a
mellow
light
which
seemed
to
dwell
fondly
on
the
leaves
of
the
trees
which
covered
the
banks
of
the
seine
from
honfleur
to
falaise
the
same
warm
genial
sunshine
filled
the
air
the
train
carried
us
through
woods
where
the
autumn
seemed
but
a
few
days
old
and
where
the
slender
leaflets
of
the
acacias
still
fluttered
in
the
caressing
breath
of
the
wind
we
passed
through
miles
upon
miles
of
orchards
where
a
few
red
leaves
were
hanging
yet
upon
the
knotted
branches
of
the
beneath
which
lay
huge
pyramids
of
apples
of
them
stood
at
every
station
the
air
was
scented
by
them
children
were
pelting
one
another
with
them
and
here
and
there
where
the
orchards
had
been
cleared
and
the
trees
stripped
flocks
of
geese
were
searching
for
those
scattered
among
the
tufts
of
grass
the
roses
were
in
blossom
and
the
chrysanthemums
were
in
their
first
glory
the
few
countrywomen
who
got
into
our
carriage
were
still
wearing
their
snowy
muslin
caps
as
in
summer
nobody
appeared
cold
and
pinched
yet
and
everybody
was
living
it
was
almost
like
going
into
a
new
world
and
i
breathed
more
freely
the
farther
we
travelled
down
into
the
interior
at
falaise
we
exchanged
the
train
for
a
small
omnibus
which
bore
the
name
noireau
conspicuously
on
its
door
i
had
discovered
that
the
little
french
i
knew
was
not
of
much
service
as
i
could
in
no
way
understand
the
rapid
answers
that
were
given
to
my
questions
a
woman
came
to
us
at
the
door
of
a
where
the
omnibus
stopped
in
falaise
and
made
a
long
and
earnest
harangue
of
which
i
did
not
recognize
one
word
at
length
we
started
off
on
the
last
stage
of
our
journey
where
could
we
be
going
to
i
began
to
ask
myself
the
question
anxiously
after
we
had
crept
on
at
a
for
what
seemed
an
interminable
time
we
had
passed
through
long
avenues
of
trees
and
across
a
series
of
wide
flat
plains
and
down
roads
into
narrow
valleys
and
up
the
opposite
ascents
and
still
the
bells
upon
the
collars
jingled
sleepily
and
their
shambled
along
the
roads
we
were
seldom
in
sight
of
any
house
and
we
passed
through
very
few
villages
i
felt
as
if
we
were
going
all
the
way
to
marseilles
i
so
hungry
said
minima
after
a
very
long
silence
i
too
had
been
hungry
for
an
hour
or
two
past
we
had
breakfasted
at
at
one
of
the
stations
but
we
had
had
nothing
to
eat
since
except
a
roll
which
minima
had
brought
away
from
breakfast
with
wise
prevision
but
this
had
disappeared
long
ago
try
to
go
to
sleep
i
said
lean
against
me
we
must
be
there
soon
yes
she
answered
and
it
such
a
splendid
school
i
going
to
stay
there
four
years
you
know
so
it
foolish
to
mind
being
hungry
now
minima
i
must
recollect
that
courage
olivia
i
repeated
to
myself
the
farther
you
go
the
more
secure
will
be
your
the
child
nestled
against
me
and
soon
fell
asleep
i
went
to
sleep
myself
an
unquiet
slumber
broken
by
terrifying
dreams
sometimes
i
was
falling
from
the
cliffs
in
sark
into
the
deep
transparent
waters
below
where
the
sharp
rocks
lay
like
swords
then
i
was
in
the
gouliot
caves
with
martin
dobrée
at
my
side
and
the
tide
was
coming
in
too
strongly
for
us
and
beyond
in
the
opening
through
which
we
might
have
escaped
my
husband
face
looked
in
at
us
with
a
hideous
exultation
upon
it
i
woke
at
last
shivering
with
cold
and
dread
for
i
had
fancied
that
he
had
found
me
and
was
carrying
me
away
again
to
his
old
hateful
haunts
our
omnibus
was
jolting
and
rumbling
down
some
steep
and
narrow
streets
lighted
by
swung
across
them
there
were
no
lights
in
any
of
the
houses
save
a
few
in
the
upper
windows
as
though
the
inmates
were
all
in
bed
or
going
to
bed
only
at
the
inn
where
we
stopped
was
there
any
thing
like
life
a
lamp
which
hung
over
the
archway
leading
to
the
yard
and
stables
lit
up
a
group
of
people
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
omnibus
i
woke
up
minima
from
her
deep
and
heavy
sleep
we
are
here
at
noireau
i
said
we
have
reached
our
home
at
last
the
door
was
opened
before
the
child
was
fairly
awake
a
small
cluster
of
bystanders
gathered
round
us
as
we
alighted
and
watched
our
luggage
put
down
from
the
roof
while
the
driver
ran
on
volubly
and
with
many
gesticulations
addressed
to
the
little
crowd
he
the
the
landlady
and
all
the
rest
surrounded
us
as
solemnly
as
if
they
were
assisting
at
a
funeral
there
was
not
a
symptom
of
amusement
but
they
all
stared
at
us
unflinchingly
as
if
a
single
wink
of
their
eyelids
would
cause
them
to
lose
some
extraordinary
spectacle
if
i
had
been
a
total
eclipse
of
the
sun
and
they
a
group
of
enthusiastic
astronomers
bent
upon
observing
every
phenomenon
they
could
not
have
gazed
more
steadily
minima
was
leaning
against
me
half
asleep
a
narrow
vista
of
tall
houses
lay
to
the
right
and
left
lost
in
impenetrable
darkness
the
strip
of
sky
overhead
was
black
with
midnight
noireau
i
asked
in
a
tone
of
interrogation
oui
oui
madame
responded
a
chorus
of
voices
carry
me
to
the
house
of
monsieur
emile
perrier
the
i
said
speaking
slowly
and
distinctly
the
words
simple
as
they
were
seemed
to
awaken
considerable
excitement
the
landlady
threw
up
her
hands
with
an
expression
of
astonishment
and
the
driver
recommenced
his
harangue
was
it
possible
that
i
could
have
made
a
mistake
in
so
short
and
easy
a
sentence
i
said
it
over
again
to
myself
and
felt
sure
i
was
right
with
renewed
confidence
i
repeated
it
aloud
with
a
slight
variation
i
wish
to
go
to
the
house
of
monsieur
emile
perrier
the
i
said
but
while
they
still
clustered
round
minima
and
me
giving
no
sign
of
compliance
with
my
request
two
persons
thrust
themselves
through
the
circle
the
one
was
a
man
in
a
threadbare
brown
greatcoat
with
a
large
woollen
comforter
wound
several
times
about
his
neck
and
the
other
a
woman
in
an
equally
shabby
dress
who
spoke
to
me
in
broken
english
mees
i
am
madame
perrier
and
this
my
husband
she
said
come
on
the
letter
was
here
only
an
hour
ago
but
all
is
ready
come
on
come
on
she
put
her
hand
through
my
arm
and
took
hold
of
minima
hand
as
if
claiming
both
of
us
a
dead
silence
had
fallen
upon
the
little
crowd
as
if
they
were
trying
to
catch
the
meaning
of
the
english
words
but
as
she
pushed
on
with
us
both
in
her
hands
a
titter
for
the
first
time
ran
from
lip
to
lip
i
glanced
back
and
saw
monsieur
perrier
the
hurriedly
putting
our
luggage
on
a
wheelbarrow
and
preparing
to
follow
us
with
it
along
the
dark
streets
i
was
too
bewildered
yet
to
feel
any
astonishment
we
were
in
france
in
a
remote
part
of
france
and
i
did
not
know
what
frenchmen
would
or
would
not
do
madame
perrier
exhausted
with
her
effort
at
speaking
english
had
ceased
speaking
to
me
and
contented
herself
with
guiding
us
along
the
strange
streets
we
stopped
at
last
opposite
the
large
handsome
house
which
stood
in
the
front
of
the
photograph
i
had
seen
in
london
i
could
just
recognize
it
in
the
darkness
and
behind
lay
the
garden
and
the
second
range
of
building
not
a
glimmer
of
light
shone
in
any
of
the
windows
it
is
midnight
nearly
said
madame
perrier
as
we
came
to
a
and
waited
for
her
husband
the
even
when
he
came
up
with
the
luggage
there
seemed
some
difficulty
in
effecting
an
entrance
he
passed
through
the
and
disappeared
round
the
corner
of
the
house
walking
softly
as
if
careful
not
to
disturb
the
household
how
long
the
waiting
seemed
for
we
were
hungry
sleepy
and
cold
strangers
in
a
very
strange
land
i
heard
minima
sigh
weariedly
at
last
he
reappeared
round
the
corner
carrying
a
candle
which
flickered
in
the
wind
not
a
word
was
spoken
by
him
or
his
wife
as
the
latter
conducted
us
toward
him
we
were
to
enter
by
the
that
was
evident
but
i
did
not
care
what
door
we
entered
by
so
that
we
might
soon
find
rest
and
food
she
led
us
into
a
room
where
i
could
just
make
out
what
appeared
to
be
a
carpenter
bench
with
a
heap
of
lying
under
it
but
i
was
too
weary
to
be
certain
about
any
thing
it
is
a
leetle
cabinet
of
work
of
my
husband
said
madame
perrier
our
chamber
is
above
and
the
chamber
for
you
and
leetle
mees
is
there
also
but
the
school
is
not
there
will
you
go
to
bed
will
you
sleep
come
on
mees
but
we
are
very
hungry
i
remonstrated
we
have
had
nothing
to
eat
since
noon
we
could
not
sleep
without
food
bah
that
is
true
she
said
well
come
on
the
food
is
at
the
school
come
on
that
must
be
the
house
at
the
back
we
went
down
the
broad
gravel
walk
with
the
pretty
garden
at
the
side
of
us
where
a
fountain
was
tinkling
and
splashing
busily
in
the
quiet
night
but
we
passed
the
front
of
the
house
behind
it
without
stopping
at
the
door
madame
led
us
through
a
into
a
low
long
vaulted
passage
with
doors
opening
on
each
side
a
black
place
with
the
feeble
flickering
light
of
the
candle
throwing
on
to
the
damp
walls
a
sinister
gleam
minima
pressed
very
close
to
me
and
i
felt
a
strange
quiver
of
apprehension
but
the
thought
that
there
was
no
escape
from
it
and
no
help
at
hand
nerved
me
to
follow
quietly
to
the
end
chapter
the
eighth
at
school
in
france
the
end
brought
us
out
into
a
mean
poor
street
narrow
even
where
the
best
streets
were
narrow
a
small
house
the
exterior
of
which
i
discovered
afterward
to
be
neglected
and
almost
dilapidated
stood
before
us
and
madame
unlocked
the
door
with
a
key
from
her
pocket
we
were
conducted
into
a
small
kitchen
where
a
fire
had
been
burning
lately
though
it
was
now
out
and
only
a
little
warmth
lingered
about
the
stove
minima
was
set
upon
a
chair
opposite
to
it
with
her
feet
in
the
oven
and
i
was
invited
to
do
the
same
i
assented
mechanically
and
looked
furtively
about
me
while
madame
was
busy
in
cutting
a
huge
hunch
or
two
of
black
bread
and
spreading
upon
them
a
thin
scraping
of
rancid
butter
there
was
an
here
burning
with
a
clear
bright
blaze
face
was
illuminated
by
it
it
was
a
coarse
sullen
face
with
an
expression
of
low
cunning
about
it
there
was
not
a
trace
of
refinement
or
culture
about
her
not
even
the
proverbial
taste
of
a
frenchwoman
in
dress
the
kitchen
was
a
picture
of
squalid
dirt
and
neglect
the
walls
and
ceiling
black
with
smoke
and
the
floor
so
crusted
over
with
unswept
refuse
and
litter
that
i
thought
it
was
not
quarried
the
few
were
scattered
about
in
disorder
the
stove
before
which
we
sat
was
rusty
could
i
be
dreaming
of
this
filthy
dwelling
and
this
slovenly
woman
no
it
was
all
too
real
for
me
to
doubt
their
existence
for
an
instant
she
was
pouring
out
some
cold
tea
into
two
little
cups
when
monsieur
perrier
made
his
appearance
his
face
begrimed
and
his
shaggy
hair
uncombed
i
had
been
used
to
the
sight
of
rough
men
in
adelaide
on
our
but
i
had
never
seen
one
more
boorish
he
stood
in
the
doorway
rubbing
his
hands
and
gazing
at
us
unflinchingly
with
the
hard
stare
of
a
norman
peasant
while
he
spoke
in
rapid
uncouth
tones
to
his
wife
i
turned
away
my
head
and
shut
my
eyes
to
this
unwelcome
sight
eat
mees
said
the
woman
bringing
us
our
food
there
is
tea
we
give
our
pupils
and
instructresses
tea
for
supper
at
six
after
that
there
is
no
more
to
eat
i
took
a
mouthful
of
the
food
but
i
could
hardly
swallow
it
exhausted
as
i
was
from
hunger
the
bread
was
sour
and
the
butter
rancid
the
tea
tasted
of
garlic
minima
ate
hers
ravenously
without
uttering
a
word
the
child
had
not
spoken
since
we
entered
these
new
scenes
her
careworn
face
was
puckered
and
her
sharp
eyes
were
glancing
about
her
more
openly
than
mine
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
her
hunch
of
black
bread
i
signified
to
madame
perrier
that
we
were
ready
to
go
to
our
bedroom
we
had
the
same
vaulted
passage
and
to
traverse
on
our
way
back
to
the
other
house
there
we
were
ushered
into
a
room
containing
only
two
beds
and
our
two
boxes
i
helped
minima
to
undress
and
tucked
her
up
in
bed
trying
not
to
see
the
thin
little
face
and
sharp
eyes
which
wanted
to
meet
mine
and
look
into
them
she
put
her
arm
round
my
neck
and
drew
down
my
head
to
whisper
cautiously
into
my
ear
they
cheats
she
said
earnestly
dreadful
cheats
this
is
a
splendid
place
at
all
oh
whatever
shall
i
do
shall
i
have
to
stay
here
four
years
hush
minima
i
answered
perhaps
it
is
better
than
we
think
now
we
are
tired
we
shall
see
the
place
better
and
it
may
be
splendid
after
all
kiss
me
and
go
to
sleep
but
it
was
too
much
for
me
far
too
much
the
long
long
journey
the
hunger
the
total
destruction
of
all
my
hopes
the
dreary
prospect
that
stretched
before
me
i
laid
my
aching
head
on
my
pillow
and
cried
myself
to
sleep
like
a
child
i
was
awakened
while
it
was
yet
quite
dark
by
the
sound
of
a
carpenter
tool
in
the
room
below
me
almost
immediately
a
loud
knock
came
at
my
door
and
the
harsh
voice
of
madame
called
to
us
get
up
mees
get
up
and
come
on
she
said
you
make
your
toilet
at
the
school
come
on
quick
minima
was
more
dexterous
than
i
in
dressing
herself
in
the
dark
but
we
were
not
long
in
getting
ready
the
air
was
raw
and
foggy
when
we
turned
and
it
was
so
dark
still
that
we
could
scarcely
discern
the
outline
of
the
walls
and
houses
but
madame
was
waiting
to
conduct
us
once
more
to
the
other
house
and
as
she
did
so
she
volunteered
an
explanation
of
their
somewhat
singular
arrangement
of
dwelling
in
two
houses
the
school
she
informed
me
was
registered
in
the
name
of
her
head
governess
not
in
her
own
and
as
the
laws
of
france
prohibited
any
man
dwelling
under
the
same
roof
with
a
school
of
girls
except
the
husband
of
the
proprietor
they
were
compelled
to
rent
two
dwellings
how
many
pupils
have
you
madame
i
inquired
we
have
six
mees
she
replied
they
are
here
see
them
we
had
reached
the
house
and
she
opened
the
door
of
a
long
low
room
there
was
an
open
hearth
with
a
few
logs
of
green
wood
upon
it
but
they
were
not
kindled
a
table
ran
almost
the
whole
length
of
the
room
with
forms
on
each
side
a
high
chair
or
two
stood
about
all
was
comfortless
dreary
and
squalid
but
the
girls
who
were
sitting
on
the
hard
benches
by
the
table
were
still
more
squalid
and
their
faces
were
pinched
and
just
now
blue
with
cold
and
their
hands
were
swollen
and
red
with
chilblains
they
had
a
cowed
and
frightened
expression
and
peeped
askance
at
us
as
we
went
in
behind
madame
minima
pressed
closely
to
me
and
clasped
my
hand
tightly
in
her
little
fingers
we
were
both
entering
upon
the
routine
of
a
new
life
and
the
first
introduction
to
it
was
disheartening
three
are
english
said
madame
and
three
are
french
the
english
are
they
are
always
sheever
sheever
sheever
behold
how
they
have
fingers
red
and
big
bah
it
is
disgusting
she
rapped
one
of
the
swollen
hands
which
lay
upon
the
table
and
the
girl
dropped
it
out
of
sight
upon
her
lap
with
a
frightened
glance
at
the
woman
minima
fingers
tightened
upon
mine
the
head
governess
a
frenchwoman
of
about
thirty
with
a
number
of
little
black
papillotes
circling
about
her
head
was
now
introduced
to
me
and
an
animated
conversation
followed
between
her
and
madame
you
comprehend
the
french
asked
the
latter
turning
with
a
suspicious
look
to
me
no
i
answered
i
know
very
little
of
it
yet
good
she
replied
we
will
eat
breakfast
but
i
have
not
made
my
toilet
i
objected
there
was
neither
washingstand
nor
in
my
room
bah
she
said
scornfully
there
are
no
gentlemans
here
no
person
will
see
you
you
make
your
toilet
before
the
promenade
not
at
this
moment
it
was
evident
that
uncomplaining
submission
was
expected
and
no
remonstrance
would
be
of
avail
breakfast
was
being
brought
in
by
one
of
the
pupils
it
consisted
of
a
teacupful
of
coffee
at
the
bottom
of
a
big
basin
which
was
placed
before
each
of
us
a
large
tablespoon
to
feed
ourselves
with
and
a
heaped
plateful
of
hunches
of
bread
similar
to
those
i
had
turned
from
last
night
but
i
could
fast
no
longer
i
sat
down
with
the
rest
at
the
long
table
and
ate
my
food
with
a
sinking
and
sorrowful
heart
minima
drank
her
scanty
allowance
of
coffee
thirstily
and
then
asked
in
a
timid
voice
if
she
could
have
a
little
more
madame
eyes
glared
upon
her
and
her
voice
snapped
out
an
answer
while
the
english
girls
looked
frightened
and
drew
in
their
bony
shoulders
as
if
such
temerity
made
them
shudder
as
soon
as
madame
was
gone
the
child
flung
her
arms
around
me
and
hid
her
face
in
my
bosom
oh
she
cried
do
you
leave
me
do
forsake
me
i
have
to
stay
here
four
years
and
it
will
kill
me
i
shall
die
if
you
go
away
and
leave
me
i
soothed
her
as
best
i
could
without
promising
to
remain
in
this
trap
would
it
not
be
possible
in
some
way
to
release
her
as
well
as
myself
i
sat
thinking
through
the
long
cold
morning
with
the
monotonous
hum
of
lessons
in
my
ears
there
was
nothing
for
me
to
do
and
i
found
that
i
could
not
return
to
the
house
where
i
had
slept
and
where
my
luggage
was
until
night
came
again
i
sat
all
the
morning
in
the
chilly
room
with
minima
on
the
floor
at
my
feet
clinging
to
me
for
protection
and
warmth
such
as
i
could
give
but
what
could
i
do
either
for
her
or
myself
my
store
of
money
was
almost
all
gone
for
our
joint
expenses
had
cost
more
than
i
had
anticipated
and
i
could
very
well
see
that
i
must
not
expect
madame
perrier
to
refund
minima
fare
there
was
perhaps
enough
left
to
carry
me
back
to
england
and
just
land
me
on
its
shores
but
what
then
where
was
i
to
go
then
penniless
friendless
without
character
without
a
name
but
an
assumed
one
what
was
to
become
of
me
i
began
to
wonder
vaguely
whether
i
should
be
forced
to
make
myself
known
to
my
husband
whether
fate
would
not
drive
me
back
to
him
no
that
should
never
be
i
would
face
and
endure
any
hardship
rather
than
return
to
my
former
life
a
hundred
times
better
this
squalid
wretched
foreign
school
than
the
degradation
of
heart
and
soul
i
had
suffered
with
him
i
could
do
no
more
for
minima
than
for
myself
for
i
dared
not
even
write
to
wilkinson
who
was
either
an
accomplice
or
a
dupe
of
these
perriers
my
letter
might
fall
into
the
hands
of
richard
foster
or
the
woman
living
with
him
and
so
they
would
track
me
out
and
i
should
have
no
means
of
escape
i
dared
not
run
that
risk
the
only
thing
i
could
do
for
her
was
to
stay
with
her
and
as
far
as
possible
shield
her
from
the
privations
and
distress
that
threatened
us
both
i
was
safe
here
no
one
was
likely
to
come
across
me
in
this
remote
place
who
could
by
any
chance
know
me
i
had
at
least
a
roof
over
my
head
i
had
food
to
eat
elsewhere
i
was
not
sure
of
either
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
choice
given
me
than
to
remain
in
the
trap
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
minima
i
whispered
to
the
child
through
the
hum
of
lessons
her
shrewd
little
face
brightened
with
a
smile
that
smoothed
all
the
wrinkles
out
of
it
that
what
father
said
she
cried
he
said
minima
god
will
take
care
of
my
little
daughter
god
has
sent
you
to
take
care
of
me
suppose
i
come
all
the
way
alone
and
found
it
such
a
horrid
place
chapter
the
ninth
a
french
avocat
december
came
in
with
intense
severity
icicles
a
yard
long
hung
to
the
eaves
and
the
snow
lay
unmelted
for
days
together
on
the
roofs
more
often
than
not
we
were
without
wood
for
our
fire
and
when
we
had
it
it
was
green
and
unseasoned
and
only
smouldered
away
with
a
smoke
that
stung
and
irritated
our
eyes
our
insufficient
and
unwholesome
food
supplied
us
with
no
inward
warmth
coal
in
that
remote
district
cost
too
much
for
any
but
the
wealthiest
people
now
and
then
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
blazing
fire
in
the
houses
i
had
to
pass
to
get
to
our
chamber
over
monsieur
perrier
workshop
and
in
an
evening
the
dainty
savory
smell
of
dinner
cooking
in
the
kitchen
adjoining
sometimes
filled
the
frosty
air
both
sight
and
scent
were
tantalizing
and
my
dreams
at
night
were
generally
of
pleasant
food
and
warm
firesides
at
times
the
pangs
of
hunger
grew
too
strong
for
us
both
and
forced
me
to
spend
a
little
of
the
money
i
was
nursing
so
carefully
as
soon
as
i
could
make
myself
understood
i
went
out
occasionally
after
dark
to
buy
noireau
was
a
curious
town
the
streets
everywhere
steep
and
narrow
and
the
houses
rich
and
poor
large
and
small
huddled
together
without
order
almost
opposite
the
handsome
dwelling
the
photograph
of
which
had
misled
me
stood
a
little
house
where
i
could
buy
rich
creamy
milk
it
was
sold
by
a
mademoiselle
rosalie
an
old
maid
whom
i
generally
found
solitarily
reading
a
pour
with
her
feet
upon
a
and
no
light
save
that
of
her
little
she
had
never
sat
by
a
fire
in
her
life
she
told
me
burning
her
face
and
spoiling
her
her
dwelling
consisted
of
a
single
room
with
a
shed
opening
out
of
it
where
she
kept
her
milkpans
she
was
the
only
person
i
spoke
to
out
of
madame
perrier
own
household
is
monsieur
perrier
an
avocat
i
asked
her
one
day
as
soon
as
i
could
understand
what
she
might
say
in
reply
there
was
very
little
doubt
in
my
mind
as
to
what
her
answer
would
be
an
avocat
mademoiselle
she
repeated
shrugging
her
shoulders
who
has
told
you
that
are
the
avocats
in
england
like
emile
he
is
my
relation
and
you
see
me
he
is
a
bailiff
do
you
understand
if
i
go
in
debt
he
comes
and
takes
possession
of
my
goods
you
see
it
is
very
simple
one
need
not
be
very
learned
to
do
that
emile
perrier
an
avocat
bah
what
is
an
avocat
i
inquired
an
avocat
is
even
higher
than
a
notaire
she
answered
he
gives
counsel
he
pleads
before
the
judges
it
is
a
high
one
must
be
very
learned
very
eloquent
to
be
an
avocat
i
suppose
he
must
be
a
gentleman
i
remarked
a
gentleman
mademoiselle
she
said
i
do
not
understand
you
there
is
equality
in
france
we
are
all
messieurs
and
mesdames
there
is
monsieur
the
bailiff
and
monsieur
the
duke
and
there
is
madame
the
and
madame
the
duchess
we
are
all
gentlemen
all
ladies
it
is
not
the
same
in
your
country
not
at
all
i
answered
did
my
little
emile
tell
you
he
was
an
avocat
mademoiselle
she
asked
no
i
said
i
was
on
my
guard
even
if
i
had
known
french
well
enough
to
explain
the
deception
practised
upon
me
she
looked
as
if
she
did
not
believe
me
but
smiled
and
nodded
with
imperturbable
politeness
as
i
carried
off
my
jug
of
milk
so
monsieur
perrier
was
nothing
higher
than
a
bailiff
and
with
very
little
to
do
even
in
that
line
of
the
law
he
took
off
his
tasselled
cap
to
me
as
i
passed
his
workshop
and
went
with
the
milk
to
minima
who
was
already
gone
to
bed
for
the
sake
of
warmth
the
discovery
did
not
affect
me
with
surprise
if
he
had
been
an
avocat
my
astonishment
at
french
barristers
would
have
been
extreme
yet
there
was
something
galling
in
the
idea
of
being
under
the
roof
of
a
man
and
woman
of
that
class
in
some
sort
in
their
power
and
under
their
control
the
low
vulgar
cunning
of
their
nature
appeared
more
clearly
to
me
there
was
no
chance
of
success
in
any
contest
with
them
for
they
were
too
boorish
to
be
reached
by
any
weapon
i
could
use
all
i
could
do
was
to
keep
as
far
aloof
from
them
as
possible
this
was
not
difficult
to
do
for
neither
of
them
interfered
with
the
affairs
of
the
school
and
we
saw
them
only
at
meal
times
when
they
watched
every
mouthful
we
ate
with
keen
eyes
i
found
that
i
had
no
duties
to
perform
as
a
teacher
for
none
of
the
three
french
pupils
desired
to
learn
english
english
girls
who
had
been
decoyed
into
the
same
snare
by
the
same
false
photograph
and
prospectus
which
had
entrapped
me
were
all
of
families
too
poor
to
be
able
to
forfeit
the
money
which
had
been
paid
in
advance
for
their
french
education
two
of
them
however
completed
their
term
at
christmas
and
returned
home
weak
and
ill
the
third
was
to
leave
in
the
spring
i
did
not
hear
that
any
more
pupils
were
expected
and
why
madame
perrier
should
have
engaged
any
english
teacher
became
a
problem
to
me
the
premium
i
had
paid
was
too
small
to
cover
my
expenses
for
a
year
though
we
were
living
at
so
scanty
a
cost
it
was
not
long
before
i
understood
my
engagement
better
i
studied
the
language
diligently
i
felt
myself
among
foreigners
and
foes
and
i
was
helpless
till
i
could
comprehend
what
they
were
saying
in
my
presence
having
no
other
occupation
i
made
rapid
progress
though
mademoiselle
morel
the
head
governess
gave
me
very
little
assistance
she
was
a
dull
heavy
yet
woman
who
had
taken
a
diploma
as
a
teacher
yet
as
far
as
i
could
judge
knew
very
much
less
than
most
english
governesses
who
are
uncertificated
so
far
from
there
being
any
professors
attending
the
school
i
could
not
discover
that
there
were
any
in
the
town
it
was
a
town
with
a
population
of
six
thousand
most
of
them
weavers
there
were
three
or
four
small
factories
built
on
the
banks
of
the
river
where
the
hands
were
at
work
from
six
in
the
morning
till
ten
at
night
sundays
included
there
was
not
much
intellectual
life
here
a
professor
would
have
little
chance
of
making
a
living
at
first
minima
and
i
took
long
walks
together
into
the
country
surrounding
noireau
a
beautiful
country
even
in
november
once
out
of
the
vapor
lying
in
the
valley
at
the
bottom
of
which
the
town
was
built
the
atmosphere
showed
itself
as
exquisitely
clear
with
no
smoke
in
it
except
the
fine
blue
smoke
of
we
could
distinguish
the
shapes
of
trees
standing
out
against
the
horizon
miles
and
miles
away
while
between
us
and
it
lay
slopes
of
brown
woodland
and
green
pastures
with
long
rows
of
slim
poplars
the
yellow
leaves
clinging
to
them
still
and
winding
round
them
like
garlands
on
a
but
this
pleasure
was
a
costly
one
for
it
awoke
pangs
of
hunger
which
i
was
compelled
to
appease
by
drawing
upon
my
purse
we
learned
that
it
was
necessary
to
stay
and
cultivate
a
small
appetite
am
i
getting
very
thin
asked
minima
one
day
as
she
held
up
her
transparent
hand
against
the
light
how
thin
do
you
think
i
could
get
without
dying
aunt
nelly
oh
a
great
deal
thinner
my
darling
i
said
kissing
the
little
fingers
my
heart
was
bound
up
in
the
child
i
had
been
so
lonely
without
her
that
now
her
constant
companionship
her
prattle
seemed
necessary
to
me
there
was
no
longer
any
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
i
could
leave
her
i
only
wondered
what
i
should
do
when
my
year
was
run
out
and
only
one
of
those
four
of
hers
for
which
these
wretches
had
received
the
payment
some
people
can
get
very
thin
indeed
she
went
on
with
her
shrewd
quaint
smile
i
heard
the
boys
at
school
talk
about
it
one
of
them
had
seen
a
living
skeleton
that
was
all
skin
and
bone
and
no
flesh
i
should
like
to
be
a
living
skeleton
and
be
made
a
show
of
do
you
think
i
ever
shall
be
if
i
stay
here
four
years
perhaps
they
take
me
about
as
a
show
why
you
are
talking
nonsense
minima
i
answered
am
i
she
said
wistfully
as
if
the
idea
really
troubled
her
i
dream
of
it
often
and
often
i
can
feel
all
my
bones
now
and
count
them
when
i
in
bed
some
of
them
are
getting
very
sharp
the
boys
used
to
say
they
get
as
sharp
as
knives
sometimes
and
cut
through
the
skin
but
father
said
it
was
only
boys
talk
your
father
was
right
i
answered
you
must
think
of
what
he
said
not
the
boys
talk
but
she
continued
the
boys
said
sometimes
people
get
so
hungry
they
bite
pieces
out
of
their
arms
i
do
think
i
could
ever
be
so
hungry
as
that
do
you
minima
i
said
starting
up
let
us
run
to
mademoiselle
rosalie
for
some
you
afraid
of
me
beginning
to
eat
myself
she
cried
with
a
little
laugh
but
she
was
the
first
to
reach
mademoiselle
rosalie
door
and
i
watched
her
devouring
her
with
the
eagerness
of
a
ravenous
appetite
very
fast
melted
away
my
money
i
could
not
see
the
child
pining
with
hunger
though
every
sou
i
spent
made
our
return
to
england
more
difficult
madame
perrier
put
no
hinderance
in
my
way
for
the
more
food
we
purchased
ourselves
the
less
we
ate
at
her
table
the
bitter
cold
and
the
coarse
food
told
upon
minima
delicate
little
frame
yet
what
could
i
do
i
dared
not
write
to
wilkinson
and
i
very
much
doubted
if
there
would
be
any
benefit
to
be
hoped
for
if
i
ran
the
risk
minima
did
not
know
the
address
of
any
one
of
the
persons
who
had
subscribed
for
her
education
and
board
to
her
they
were
only
the
fathers
and
mothers
of
the
boys
of
whom
she
talked
so
much
she
was
as
friendless
as
i
was
in
the
world
so
far
away
were

and
tardif
that
i
dared
not
count
them
as
friends
who
could
have
any
power
to
help
me
better
for
martin
dobrée
if
he
could
altogether
forget
me
and
return
to
his
cousin
julia
perhaps
he
had
done
so
already
how
long
was
this
loneliness
this
friendlessness
to
be
my
lot
i
was
so
young
yet
that
my
life
seemed
endless
as
it
stretched
before
me
poor
desolate
hunted
i
shrank
from
life
as
an
evil
thing
and
longed
impatiently
to
be
rid
of
it
yet
how
could
i
escape
even
from
its
present
phase
chapter
the
tenth
a
misfortune
without
parallel
my
escape
was
nearer
than
i
expected
and
was
forced
upon
me
in
a
manner
i
could
never
have
foreseen
toward
the
middle
of
february
mademoiselle
morel
appeared
often
in
tears
madame
perrier
coarse
face
was
always
overcast
and
monsieur
seemed
gloomy
too
gloomy
to
retain
even
french
politeness
of
manner
toward
any
of
us
the
household
was
under
a
cloud
but
i
could
not
discover
why
what
little
discipline
and
work
there
had
been
in
the
school
was
quite
at
an
end
every
one
was
left
to
do
as
she
chose
early
one
morning
long
before
daybreak
i
was
startled
out
of
my
sleep
by
a
hurried
knock
at
my
door
i
cried
out
who
is
there
and
a
voice
indistinct
with
sobbing
replied
moi
the
moi
proved
to
be
mademoiselle
morel
i
opened
the
door
for
her
and
she
appeared
in
her
bonnet
and
carrying
a
lamp
in
her
hand
which
lit
up
her
weary
and
face
she
took
a
seat
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
and
buried
her
face
in
her
handkerchief
mademoiselle
she
said
here
is
a
grand
misfortune
a
misfortune
without
parallel
monsieur
and
madame
are
gone
gone
i
repeated
where
are
they
gone
i
do
not
know
mademoiselle
she
answered
i
know
nothing
at
all
they
are
gone
away
the
poor
good
people
were
in
debt
and
their
creditors
are
as
hard
as
stone
they
wished
to
take
every
sou
and
they
talked
of
throwing
monsieur
into
prison
you
understand
that
is
intolerable
they
are
gone
and
i
have
no
means
to
carry
on
the
establishment
the
school
is
finished
but
i
am
to
stay
here
twelve
months
i
cried
in
dismay
and
minima
was
to
stay
four
years
the
money
has
been
paid
to
them
for
it
what
is
to
become
of
us
i
can
not
say
mademoiselle
i
am
desolated
myself
she
replied
with
a
fresh
burst
of
tears
all
is
finished
here
if
you
have
not
money
enough
to
take
you
back
to
england
you
must
write
to
your
friends
going
to
return
to
bordeaux
i
detest
normandy
it
is
so
cold
and
but
what
is
to
be
done
with
the
other
pupils
i
inquired
still
lost
in
amazement
and
too
bewildered
to
realize
my
own
position
the
english
pupil
goes
with
me
to
paris
she
answered
she
has
her
friends
there
the
french
demoiselles
are
not
far
from
their
own
homes
and
they
return
by
the
omnibus
to
granville
it
is
a
misfortune
without
parallel
mademoiselle
a
misfortune
quite
without
parallel
by
the
way
she
repeated
this
phrase
it
was
evidently
a
great
consolation
to
her
as
phrases
seem
to
be
to
all
classes
of
the
french
people
but
both
the
tone
of
her
voice
and
the
expression
of
her
face
impressed
upon
me
the
conviction
that
it
was
not
her
only
consolation
in
answer
to
my
urgent
questions
she
informed
me
that
without
doubt
the
goods
left
in
the
two
houses
would
be
seized
as
soon
as
the
flight
of
madame
and
monsieur
became
known
to
crown
all
she
was
going
to
start
immediately
by
the
omnibus
to
falaise
and
on
by
rail
to
paris
not
waiting
for
the
storm
to
burst
she
kissed
me
on
both
cheeks
bade
me
adieu
and
was
gone
leaving
me
in
utter
darkness
before
i
fairly
comprehended
the
rapid
french
in
which
she
conveyed
her
intention
i
groped
to
the
window
and
saw
the
glimmering
of
her
lamp
as
she
turned
into
the
on
her
way
to
the
other
house
before
i
could
dress
and
follow
her
she
would
be
gone
i
had
seen
my
last
of
monsieur
and
madame
perrier
and
of
mademoiselle
morel
i
had
time
to
recover
from
my
consternation
and
to
see
my
position
clearly
before
the
dawn
came
leagues
of
land
and
leagues
of
sea
lay
between
me
and
england
ten
shillings
was
all
that
was
left
of
my
money
besides
this
i
had
minima
dependent
upon
me
for
it
was
impossible
to
abandon
her
to
the
charity
of
foreigners
i
had
not
the
means
of
sending
her
back
to
wilkinson
and
i
rejected
the
mere
thought
of
doing
so
partly
because
i
dared
not
run
the
risk
and
partly
because
i
could
not
harden
myself
against
the
appeals
the
child
would
make
against
such
a
destiny
but
then
what
was
to
become
of
us
i
dressed
myself
as
soon
as
the
first
faint
light
came
and
hurried
to
the
other
house
the
key
was
in
the
lock
as
mademoiselle
had
left
it
a
fire
was
burning
in
the
and
the
fragments
of
a
meal
were
scattered
about
the
table
the
pupils
were
preparing
for
their
own
departure
and
were
chattering
too
volubly
to
one
another
for
me
to
catch
the
meaning
of
their
words
they
seemed
to
know
very
well
how
to
manage
their
own
affairs
and
they
informed
me
their
places
were
taken
in
the
omnibus
and
a
porter
was
hired
to
fetch
their
luggage
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
see
for
myself
and
minima
i
carried
our
breakfast
back
with
me
when
i
returned
to
minima
her
wan
and
womanly
face
was
turned
toward
the
window
and
the
light
made
it
look
more
pinched
and
worn
than
usual
she
sat
up
in
bed
to
eat
her
scanty
breakfast
the
last
meal
we
should
have
in
this
shelter
of
ours
and
i
wrapped
a
shawl
about
her
thin
shoulders
i
wish
i
been
born
a
boy
she
said
plaintively
they
can
get
their
own
living
sooner
than
girls
and
better
how
soon
do
you
think
i
could
get
my
own
living
i
could
be
a
little
now
you
know
and
eat
very
little
what
makes
you
talk
about
getting
your
living
i
asked
how
pale
you
look
she
answered
nodding
her
little
head
why
i
heard
something
of
what
mademoiselle
said
they
all
run
away
and
left
us
to
do
what
we
can
we
shall
both
have
to
get
our
own
living
i
been
thinking
how
nice
it
would
be
if
you
could
get
a
place
as
housemaid
and
me
nurse
in
the
same
house
would
that
be
you
very
poor
are
you
aunt
nelly
very
poor
i
repeated
hiding
my
face
on
her
pillow
while
hot
tears
forced
themselves
through
my
eyelids
oh
this
will
never
do
said
the
childish
voice
we
must
cry
you
know
the
boys
always
said
it
was
like
a
baby
to
cry
and
father
used
to
say
minima
perhaps
when
all
our
money
is
gone
we
shall
find
a
great
big
purse
full
of
gold
or
else
a
beautiful
french
prince
will
see
you
and
fall
in
love
with
you
and
take
us
both
to
his
palace
and
make
you
his
princess
and
we
shall
all
grow
up
till
we
die
i
laughed
at
the
oddity
of
this
childish
climax
in
spite
of
the
heaviness
of
my
heart
and
the
springing
of
my
tears
minima
fresh
young
fancies
were
too
droll
to
resist
especially
in
combination
with
her
shrewd
knowledge
of
many
things
of
which
i
was
ignorant
i
should
know
exactly
what
to
do
if
we
were
in
london
she
resumed
we
could
take
our
things
to
the
pawnbroker
and
get
lots
of
money
for
them
that
is
what
poor
people
do
foster
has
pawned
all
her
rings
and
brooches
it
is
quite
easy
to
do
you
know
but
perhaps
there
are
no
in
france
this
incidental
mention
of
foster
had
sent
my
thoughts
and
fears
fluttering
toward
a
deep
unutterable
dread
which
was
lurking
under
all
my
other
cares
should
i
be
driven
by
the
mere
stress
of
utter
poverty
to
return
to
my
husband
there
must
be
something
wrong
in
a
law
which
bound
me
captive
body
and
soul
to
a
man
whose
very
name
had
become
a
terror
to
me
and
to
escape
whom
i
was
willing
to
face
any
difficulties
any
distresses
but
all
my
knowledge
of
the
law
came
from
his
lips
and
he
would
gladly
deceive
me
it
might
be
that
i
was
suffering
all
these
troubles
quite
needlessly
across
the
darkness
of
my
prospects
flushed
a
thought
that
seemed
like
an
angel
of
light
why
should
i
not
try
to
make
my
way
to
dobrée
martin
mother
to
whom
i
could
tell
my
whole
history
and
on
whose
friendship
and
protection
i
could
rely
implicitly
she
would
learn
for
me
how
far
the
law
would
protect
me
by
this
time
kate
daltrey
would
have
quitted
the
channel
islands
satisfied
that
i
had
eluded
her
pursuit
the
route
to
the
channel
islands
was
neither
long
nor
difficult
for
at
granville
a
vessel
sailed
directly
for
jersey
and
we
were
not
more
than
thirty
miles
from
granville
it
was
a
distance
that
we
could
almost
walk
if
dobrée
could
not
help
me
tardif
would
take
minima
into
his
house
for
a
time
and
the
child
could
not
have
a
happier
home
i
could
count
upon
my
good
tardif
doing
that
these
plans
were
taking
shape
in
my
brain
when
i
heard
a
voice
calling
softly
under
the
window
i
opened
the
casement
and
leaning
out
saw
the
welcome
face
of
rosalie
the
will
you
permit
me
to
come
in
she
inquired
yes
yes
come
in
i
said
eagerly
she
entered
and
saluted
us
both
with
much
ceremony
her
clumsy
wooden
clattered
over
the
bare
boards
and
the
wings
of
her
high
norman
cap
flapped
against
her
sallow
cheeks
no
figure
could
have
impressed
upon
me
more
forcibly
the
unwelcome
fact
that
i
was
in
great
straits
in
a
foreign
land
i
regarded
her
with
a
vague
kind
of
fear
so
my
little
emile
and
his
spouse
are
gone
mademoiselle
she
said
in
a
mysterious
whisper
i
have
been
saying
to
myself
will
my
little
english
lady
do
that
is
why
i
am
here
behold
me
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
i
answered
if
mademoiselle
is
not
difficult
she
said
she
and
the
little
one
could
rest
with
me
for
a
day
or
two
my
bed
is
clean
and
soft
bah
ten
times
softer
than
these
paillasses
i
would
ask
only
a
franc
a
night
for
it
that
is
much
less
than
at
the
hotels
where
they
charge
for
light
and
attendance
mademoiselle
could
write
to
her
friends
if
she
has
not
enough
money
to
carry
her
and
the
little
one
back
to
their
own
country
i
have
no
friends
i
said
despondently
no
friends
no
relations
she
exclaimed
not
one
i
replied
but
that
is
terrible
she
said
has
mademoiselle
plenty
of
money
only
twelve
francs
i
answered
rosalie
face
grew
long
and
grave
this
was
an
abyss
of
misfortune
she
had
not
dreamed
of
she
looked
at
us
both
critically
and
did
not
open
her
lips
again
for
a
minute
or
two
is
the
little
one
your
relation
she
inquired
after
this
pause
no
i
replied
i
did
not
know
her
till
i
brought
her
here
she
does
not
know
of
any
friends
or
relations
belonging
to
her
there
is
the
convent
for
her
she
said
the
good
sisters
would
take
a
little
girl
like
her
and
make
a
true
christian
of
her
she
might
become
a
saint
some
day
no
no
i
interrupted
hastily
i
could
not
leave
her
in
a
convent
mademoiselle
rosalie
was
very
much
offended
her
sallow
face
flushed
a
dull
red
and
the
wings
of
her
cap
flapped
as
if
she
were
about
to
take
flight
and
leave
me
in
my
difficulties
she
had
kindliness
of
feeling
but
it
was
not
proof
against
my
poverty
and
my
covert
slight
of
her
religion
i
caught
her
hand
in
mine
to
prevent
her
going
let
us
come
to
your
house
for
i
entreated
we
will
go
i
have
money
enough
to
pay
you
i
was
only
too
glad
to
get
a
shelter
for
minima
and
myself
for
another
night
she
explained
to
me
the
french
system
of
borrowing
money
upon
articles
left
in
pledge
and
offered
to
accompany
me
to
the
de
with
those
things
that
we
could
spare
but
upon
packing
up
our
few
possessions
i
remembered
that
only
a
few
days
before
madame
perrier
had
borrowed
from
me
my
mantle
the
only
valuable
thing
i
had
remaining
i
had
lent
it
reluctantly
and
in
spite
of
myself
and
it
had
never
been
returned
minima
wardrobe
was
still
poorer
than
my
own
all
the
money
we
could
raise
was
less
than
two
napoleons
and
with
this
we
had
to
make
our
way
to
granville
and
thence
to
guernsey
we
could
not
travel
luxuriously
the
next
morning
we
left
noireau
on
foot
chapter
the
eleventh
lost
at
nightfall
it
was
a
soft
spring
morning
with
an
exhilarating
jubilant
lightness
in
the
air
such
as
only
comes
in
the
very
early
spring
or
at
sunrise
on
a
dewy
a
few
gray
clouds
lay
low
along
the
horizon
but
overhead
the
sky
was
a
deep
rich
blue
with
fine
filmy
streaks
of
white
vapor
floating
slowly
across
it
the
branches
of
the
trees
were
still
bare
showing
the
blue
through
their
delicate
but
the
ends
of
the
twigs
were
thickening
and
the
swelling
under
the
rind
the
shoots
of
the
wore
a
purple
bloom
with
yellow
catkins
already
hanging
in
tassels
about
them
the
white
buds
of
the
shone
with
silvery
lustre
in
the
orchards
though
the
tangled
boughs
of
the
were
still
thickly
covered
with
gray
lichens
small
specks
of
green
among
the
gray
gave
a
promise
of
early
blossom
thrushes
were
singing
from
every
and
the
larks
lost
in
the
blue
heights
above
us
flung
down
their
triumphant
carols
careless
whether
our
ears
caught
them
or
no
a
long
straight
road
stretched
before
us
and
seemed
to
end
upon
the
skyline
in
the
far
distance
below
us
when
we
looked
back
lay
the
valley
and
the
town
and
all
around
us
a
vast
sweep
of
country
rising
up
to
the
low
floor
of
clouds
from
which
the
bright
dome
of
the
sky
was
springing
we
strolled
on
as
if
we
were
walking
on
air
and
could
feel
no
fatigue
minima
with
a
flush
upon
her
pale
cheeks
and
chattering
incessantly
about
the
boys
whose
memories
were
her
constant
companions
i
too
had
my
companions
faces
and
voices
were
about
me
which
no
eye
or
ear
but
mine
could
perceive
during
the
night
while
my
brain
had
been
between
waking
and
sleeping
i
had
been
busy
with
the
new
idea
that
had
taken
possession
of
it
the
more
i
pondered
upon
the
subject
the
more
impossible
it
appeared
that
the
laws
of
any
christian
country
should
doom
me
and
deliver
me
up
against
my
will
to
a
bondage
more
degrading
and
more
cruel
than
slavery
itself
if
every
man
i
had
said
to
myself
were
proved
to
be
good
and
chivalrous
of
high
and
steadfast
honor
it
might
be
possible
to
place
another
soul
more
frail
and
less
wise
into
his
charge
unchallenged
but
the
law
is
made
for
evil
men
not
for
good
i
began
to
believe
it
incredible
that
it
should
subject
me
to
the
tyranny
of
a
husband
who
made
my
home
a
hell
and
gave
me
no
companionship
but
that
of
the
vicious
should
the
law
make
me
forfeit
all
else
it
would
at
least
recognize
my
right
to
myself
once
free
from
the
necessity
of
hiding
i
did
not
fear
to
face
any
difficulty
surely
he
had
been
deceiving
me
and
playing
upon
my
ignorance
when
he
told
me
i
belonged
to
him
as
a
chattel
every
step
which
carried
us
nearer
to
granville
brought
new
hope
to
me
the
face
of
martin
mother
came
often
to
my
mind
looking
at
me
as
she
had
done
in
sark
with
a
mournful
yet
tender
smile
a
smile
behind
which
lay
many
tears
if
i
could
but
lay
my
head
upon
her
lap
and
tell
her
all
all
which
i
had
never
breathed
into
any
ear
i
should
feel
secure
and
happy
courage
i
said
to
myself
every
hour
brings
you
nearer
to
her
now
and
then
whenever
we
came
to
a
pleasant
place
where
a
fallen
tree
or
the
step
under
a
cross
offered
us
a
by
the
roadside
we
sat
down
scarcely
from
weariness
but
rather
for
enjoyment
i
had
full
directions
as
to
our
route
and
i
carried
a
letter
from
rosalie
to
a
cousin
of
hers
who
lived
in
a
convent
about
twelve
miles
from
noirean
where
she
assured
me
they
would
take
us
in
gladly
for
a
night
and
perhaps
send
us
on
part
of
our
way
in
their
conveyance
in
the
morning
twelve
miles
only
had
to
be
accomplished
this
first
day
and
we
could
saunter
as
we
chose
making
our
dinner
of
the
little
loaves
which
we
had
bought
hot
from
the
oven
as
we
quitted
the
town
and
drinking
of
the
clear
little
rills
which
were
gurgling
merrily
under
the
brown
if
we
reached
the
convent
before
six
we
should
find
the
doors
open
and
should
gain
admission
but
in
the
afternoon
the
sky
changed
the
low
floor
of
clouds
rose
gradually
and
began
to
spread
themselves
growing
grayer
and
thicker
as
they
crept
higher
into
the
sky
the
blue
became
paler
and
colder
the
wind
changed
a
point
or
two
from
the
south
and
a
breath
from
the
east
blew
with
a
chilly
touch
over
the
wide
open
plain
we
were
now
crossing
insensibly
our
high
spirits
sank
minima
ceased
to
prattle
and
i
began
to
shiver
a
little
more
from
an
inward
dread
of
the
utterly
unknown
future
than
from
any
chill
of
the
easterly
wind
the
road
was
very
desolate
not
a
creature
had
we
seen
for
an
hour
or
two
from
whom
i
could
inquire
if
we
were
on
the
to
granville
about
noon
we
had
passed
a
roadside
cross
standing
where
three
ways
met
and
below
it
a
board
had
pointed
toward
granville
i
had
followed
its
direction
in
confidence
but
now
i
began
to
feel
somewhat
anxious
this
road
along
which
the
grass
was
growing
was
strangely
solitary
and
dreary
it
brought
us
after
a
while
to
the
edge
of
a
common
stretching
before
us
drear
and
brown
as
far
as
my
eye
could
reach
a
wild
flat
with
no
sign
of
cultivation
and
the
road
running
across
it
lying
in
deep
ruts
where
moss
and
grass
were
springing
as
far
as
i
could
guess
it
was
drawing
near
to
five
and
if
we
had
wandered
out
of
our
way
the
right
road
took
an
opposite
direction
some
miles
behind
us
there
was
no
gleam
of
sunshine
now
no
vision
of
blue
overhead
all
there
was
gray
gloomy
and
threatening
the
horizon
was
rapidly
becoming
invisible
a
thin
cold
clinging
vapor
shut
it
from
us
every
few
minutes
a
fold
of
this
mist
overtook
us
and
wrapped
itself
about
us
until
the
moaning
wind
drifted
it
away
minima
was
quite
silent
now
and
her
weary
feet
dragged
along
the
rough
road
the
hand
which
rested
upon
my
wrist
felt
hot
as
it
clasped
it
closely
the
child
was
worn
out
and
was
suffering
more
than
i
did
though
in
uncomplaining
patience
are
you
very
tired
my
minima
i
asked
it
will
be
so
nice
to
go
to
bed
when
we
reach
the
convent
she
said
looking
up
with
a
smile
i
ca
imagine
why
the
prince
has
not
come
yet
perhaps
he
is
coming
all
the
time
i
answered
and
he
find
us
when
we
want
him
worst
we
plodded
on
after
that
looking
for
the
convent
or
for
any
dwelling
where
we
could
stay
till
morning
but
none
came
in
sight
or
any
person
from
whom
we
could
learn
where
we
were
wandering
i
was
growing
frightened
dismayed
what
would
become
of
us
both
if
we
could
find
no
shelter
from
the
cold
of
a
february
night
there
were
unshed
tears
in
my
eyes
for
i
would
not
let
minima
know
my
fears
when
i
saw
dimly
through
the
mist
a
high
cross
standing
in
the
midst
of
a
small
grove
of
yews
and
cypresses
planted
formally
about
it
there
were
three
tiers
of
steps
at
its
foot
the
lowest
partly
screened
from
the
gathering
rain
by
the
trees
the
shaft
of
the
cross
with
a
serpent
twining
about
its
base
rose
high
above
the
cypresses
and
the
image
of
the
christ
hanging
upon
its
crossbeams
fronted
the
east
which
was
now
heavy
with
clouds
the
eyes
seemed
to
be
gazing
over
the
vast
wintry
plain
lying
in
the
brown
desolateness
of
a
february
evening
the
face
was
full
of
an
unutterable
and
complete
agony
and
there
was
the
helpless
languor
of
dying
in
the
limbs
the
rain
was
beating
against
it
and
the
wind
sobbing
in
the
trees
surrounding
it
it
seemed
so
sad
so
forsaken
that
it
drew
us
to
it
without
speaking
the
child
and
i
crept
to
the
shelter
at
its
foot
and
sat
down
to
rest
there
as
if
we
were
companions
to
it
in
its
loneliness
there
was
no
sound
to
listen
to
save
the
sighing
of
the
east
wind
through
the
fine
leaflets
of
the
and
the
mist
was
rapidly
shutting
out
every
sight
but
the
awful
pathetic
form
above
us
evening
had
closed
in
night
was
coming
gradually
yet
swiftly
every
minute
was
drawing
the
darkness
more
densely
about
us
if
we
did
not
bestir
ourselves
soon
and
hasten
along
it
would
overtake
us
and
find
us
without
resource
yet
i
felt
as
if
i
had
no
heart
to
abandon
that
gray
figure
with
the
beating
heavily
against
it
i
forgot
myself
forgot
minima
forgot
all
the
world
while
looking
up
to
the
face
growing
more
dim
to
me
through
my
own
tears
hush
hush
cried
minima
though
i
was
neither
moving
nor
speaking
and
the
stillness
was
profound
hark
i
hear
something
coming
along
the
road
only
very
far
off
i
listened
for
a
minute
or
two
and
there
reached
my
ears
a
faint
tinkling
which
drew
nearer
and
nearer
every
moment
at
last
it
was
plainly
the
sound
of
bells
on
a
horse
collar
and
presently
i
could
distinguish
the
beat
of
a
horse
hoofs
coming
slowly
along
the
road
in
a
few
minutes
some
person
would
be
passing
by
who
would
be
able
to
help
us
and
no
one
could
be
so
inhuman
as
to
leave
us
in
our
distress
it
was
too
dark
now
to
see
far
along
the
road
but
as
we
waited
and
watched
there
came
into
sight
a
rude
sort
of
covered
carriage
like
a
drawn
by
a
horse
with
a
blue
hanging
round
his
neck
the
pace
at
which
he
was
going
was
not
above
a
and
he
came
almost
to
a
opposite
the
cross
as
if
it
was
customary
to
pause
there
this
was
the
instant
to
appeal
for
aid
i
darted
forward
in
front
of
the
à
and
stretched
out
my
hands
to
the
driver
help
us
i
cried
we
have
lost
our
way
and
the
night
is
come
help
us
for
the
love
of
christ
i
could
see
now
that
the
driver
was
a
burly
cleanshaven
norman
peasant
wearing
a
white
cotton
cap
with
a
tassel
over
his
forehead
who
stared
at
me
and
at
minima
dragging
herself
weariedly
to
my
side
as
if
we
had
both
dropped
from
the
clouds
he
crossed
himself
hurriedly
and
glanced
at
the
grove
of
dark
solemn
trees
from
which
we
had
come
but
by
his
side
sat
a
priest
in
his
cassock
and
hat
fastened
up
at
the
sides
who
alighted
almost
before
i
had
finished
speaking
and
stood
before
us
bareheaded
and
bowing
profoundly
madame
he
said
in
a
bland
tone
to
what
town
are
you
going
we
are
going
to
granville
i
answered
but
i
am
afraid
i
have
lost
the
way
we
are
very
tired
this
little
child
and
i
we
can
walk
no
more
monsieur
take
care
of
us
i
pray
you
i
spoke
brokenly
for
in
an
extremity
like
this
it
was
difficult
to
put
my
request
into
french
the
priest
appeared
perplexed
but
he
went
back
to
the
à
and
held
a
short
earnest
conversation
with
the
driver
in
a
subdued
voice
madame
he
said
returning
to
me
i
am
francis
laurentie
the
curé
of
it
is
quite
a
small
village
about
a
league
from
here
and
we
are
on
the
road
to
it
but
the
route
to
granville
is
two
leagues
behind
us
and
it
is
still
farther
to
the
first
village
there
is
not
time
to
return
with
you
this
evening
will
you
then
go
with
us
to
and
we
will
send
you
on
to
granville
he
spoke
very
slowly
and
distinctly
with
a
clear
cordial
voice
which
filled
me
with
confidence
i
could
hardly
distinguish
his
features
but
his
hair
was
silvery
white
and
shone
in
the
gloom
as
he
still
stood
bareheaded
before
me
though
the
rain
was
falling
fast
take
care
of
us
monsieur
i
replied
putting
my
hand
in
his
we
will
go
with
you
make
haste
then
my
children
he
said
cheerfully
the
rain
will
hurt
you
let
me
lift
the
into
the
à
bah
how
little
she
is
now
madame
permit
me
there
was
a
seat
in
the
back
of
the
à
which
we
reached
by
climbing
over
the
front
bench
assisted
by
the
driver
there
we
were
well
sheltered
from
the
driving
wind
and
rain
with
our
feet
resting
upon
a
sack
of
potatoes
and
the
two
strange
figures
of
the
norman
peasant
in
his
blouse
and
white
cotton
cap
and
the
curé
in
his
hat
and
cassock
filling
up
the
front
of
the
car
before
us
it
was
so
unlike
any
thing
i
had
foreseen
that
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
it
was
real
chapter
the
twelfth
the
curé
of
they
are
not
frenchwomen
monsieur
le
curé
observed
the
driver
after
a
short
pause
we
were
travelling
slowly
for
the
curé
would
not
allow
the
peasant
to
whip
on
the
shaggy
we
were
moreover
going
along
roads
as
rough
as
any
about
my
father
with
large
round
stones
deeply
bedded
in
the
soil
no
no
my
good
jean
was
the
curé
answer
by
their
tongue
i
should
say
they
are
english
englishwomen
are
extremely
intrepid
and
voyage
about
all
the
world
quite
alone
like
this
it
is
only
a
marvel
to
me
that
we
have
never
encountered
one
of
them
before
but
monsieur
le
curé
are
they
christian
inquired
jean
with
a
backward
glance
at
us
evidently
he
had
not
altogether
recovered
from
the
fright
we
had
given
him
when
we
appeared
suddenly
from
out
of
the
gloomy
shadows
of
the
cypresses
the
english
nation
is
protestant
replied
the
curé
with
a
sigh
but
monsieur
exclaimed
jean
if
they
are
protestants
they
can
not
be
christians
is
it
not
true
that
all
the
protestants
go
to
hell
on
the
back
of
that
bad
king
who
had
six
wives
all
at
one
time
not
all
at
one
time
my
good
jean
the
curé
answered
mildly
no
no
surely
they
do
not
all
go
to
perdition
if
they
know
any
thing
of
the
love
of
christ
they
must
be
christians
however
feeble
and
ignorant
he
does
not
quench
the
smoking
flax
jean
did
you
not
hear
madame
say
me
for
the
love
of
christ
good
there
is
the
smoking
flax
which
may
burn
into
a
flame
brighter
than
yours
or
mine
some
day
my
poor
friend
we
must
make
her
and
the
as
welcome
as
if
they
were
good
catholics
she
is
very
poor
cela
saute
aux
yeux
monsieur
i
interrupted
feeling
almost
guilty
in
having
listened
so
far
i
understand
french
very
well
though
i
speak
it
badly
pardon
madame
he
replied
i
hope
you
will
not
be
grieved
by
the
foolish
words
we
have
been
speaking
one
to
the
other
after
that
all
was
still
again
for
some
time
except
the
tinkling
of
the
bells
and
the
of
the
horse
feet
upon
the
steep
and
rugged
road
hills
rose
on
each
side
of
us
which
were
thickly
planted
with
trees
even
the
figures
of
the
curé
and
driver
were
no
longer
well
defined
in
the
denser
darkness
minima
had
laid
her
head
on
my
shoulder
and
seemed
to
be
asleep
a
village
clock
striking
echoed
faintly
down
the
valley
and
the
curé
turned
round
and
addressed
me
again
there
is
my
village
madame
he
said
stretching
forth
his
hand
to
point
it
out
though
we
could
not
see
a
yard
beyond
the
à
it
is
very
small
and
my
parish
contains
but
four
hundred
and
souls
some
of
them
very
little
ones
they
all
know
me
and
regard
me
as
a
father
they
love
me
though
i
have
some
rebel
is
it
not
so
jean
rebel
sons
but
not
many
rebel
daughters
here
we
are
we
entered
a
narrow
and
the
houses
as
i
saw
afterward
were
all
huddled
together
with
a
small
church
at
the
point
farthest
from
the
entrance
and
the
road
ended
at
its
porch
as
if
there
were
no
other
place
in
the
world
beyond
it
as
we
clattered
along
the
dogs
barked
and
the
flew
open
children
toddled
to
the
thresholds
and
called
after
us
in
shrill
notes
and
a
monsieur
le
curé
men
voices
deeper
and
slower
echoed
the
salutation
the
curé
was
busy
greeting
each
one
in
return
my
little
rogue
my
lamb
to
all
of
you
my
friends
his
cordial
voice
making
each
word
sound
as
if
it
came
from
his
very
heart
i
felt
that
we
were
perfectly
secure
in
his
keeping
never
as
long
as
i
live
shall
i
smell
the
pungent
pleasant
scent
of
wood
burning
without
recalling
to
my
memory
that
darksome
entrance
into
we
drove
at
last
into
a
square
courtyard
paved
with
pebbles
almost
before
the
horse
could
stop
i
saw
a
stream
of
light
shining
from
an
open
door
across
a
causeway
and
the
voice
of
a
woman
whom
i
could
not
see
spoke
eagerly
as
soon
as
the
horse
hoofs
had
ceased
to
scrape
upon
the
pebbles
hast
thou
brought
a
doctor
with
thee
my
brother
she
asked
i
have
brought
no
doctor
except
thy
brother
my
sister
answered
monsieur
laurentie
also
a
treasure
which
i
found
at
the
foot
of
the
calvary
down
yonder
he
had
alighted
while
saying
this
and
the
rest
of
the
conversation
was
carried
on
in
whispers
there
was
some
one
ill
in
the
house
and
our
arrival
was
that
was
quite
clear
whoever
the
woman
was
that
had
come
to
the
door
she
did
not
advance
to
speak
to
me
but
retreated
as
soon
as
the
conversation
was
over
while
the
curé
returned
to
the
side
of
the
à
and
asked
me
to
remain
where
i
was
with
minima
for
a
few
minutes
the
horse
was
taken
out
by
jean
and
led
away
to
the
stable
the
shafts
of
the
à
being
supported
by
two
props
put
under
them
then
the
place
grew
profoundly
quiet
i
leaned
forward
to
look
at
the
presbytery
which
i
supposed
this
house
to
be
it
was
a
low
large
building
of
two
stories
with
eaves
projecting
two
or
three
feet
over
the
upper
one
at
the
end
of
it
rose
the
belfry
of
the
church
an
open
belfry
with
one
bell
hanging
underneath
a
little
square
roof
of
tiles
the
church
itself
was
quite
hidden
by
the
surrounding
walls
and
roofs
all
was
dark
except
a
feeble
glimmering
in
four
upper
casements
which
seemed
to
belong
to
one
large
room
the
chimed
a
quarter
then
and
must
have
been
near
upon
the
but
yet
there
was
no
sign
that
we
were
remembered
minima
was
still
asleep
i
was
growing
cold
depressed
and
anxious
when
the
opened
once
more
and
the
curé
appeared
carrying
a
lamp
which
he
placed
on
the
low
stone
wall
surrounding
the
court
pardon
madame
he
said
approaching
us
but
my
sister
is
too
much
occupied
with
a
sick
person
to
do
herself
the
honor
of
attending
upon
you
permit
me
to
fill
her
place
and
excuse
her
i
pray
you
give
me
the
poor
i
will
lift
her
down
first
and
then
assist
you
to
descend
his
politeness
did
not
seem
studied
it
had
too
kindly
a
tone
to
be
artificial
i
lifted
minima
over
the
front
seat
and
sprang
down
myself
glad
to
be
released
from
my
stiff
position
and
hardly
availing
myself
of
his
proffered
help
he
did
not
conduct
us
through
the
open
door
but
led
us
round
the
angle
of
the
presbytery
to
a
small
outhouse
opening
on
to
the
court
and
with
no
other
entrance
it
was
a
building
lying
between
the
porch
and
belfry
of
the
church
and
his
own
dwelling
place
but
it
looked
comfortable
and
inviting
a
fire
had
been
hastily
kindled
on
an
open
hearth
and
a
heap
of
wood
lay
beside
it
a
table
stood
close
by
in
the
light
and
warmth
on
which
were
steaming
two
basins
of
soup
and
an
omelette
fresh
from
the
with
fruit
and
wine
for
a
second
course
two
beds
were
in
this
room
one
with
hangings
over
the
head
and
a
large
tall
cross
at
the
the
other
a
low
narrow
pallet
lying
along
the
foot
of
it
a
crucifix
hung
upon
the
wall
and
the
of
the
high
window
also
formed
a
cross
it
seemed
a
strange
goal
to
reach
after
our
day
wanderings
monsieur
laurentie
put
the
lamp
down
on
the
table
and
drew
the
logs
of
wood
together
on
the
hearth
he
was
an
old
man
as
i
then
thought
over
sixty
he
looked
round
upon
us
with
a
benevolent
smile
madame
he
said
our
hospitality
is
rude
and
simple
but
you
are
very
welcome
guests
my
sister
is
desolated
that
she
must
leave
you
to
my
cares
but
if
there
be
any
thing
you
have
need
of
tell
me
i
pray
you
there
is
nothing
monsieur
i
answered
you
are
too
good
to
us
too
good
no
no
madame
he
said
be
content
i
will
send
you
to
granville
under
the
charge
of
my
good
jean
sleep
well
my
children
and
fear
nothing
the
good
god
will
protect
you
he
closed
the
door
after
him
as
he
spoke
but
opened
it
again
to
call
my
attention
to
a
thick
wooden
bar
with
which
i
might
fasten
it
inside
if
i
chose
and
to
tell
me
not
to
alarm
myself
when
i
heard
the
bell
overhead
toll
for
matins
at
five
in
the
morning
i
listened
to
his
receding
footsteps
and
then
turned
eagerly
to
the
food
which
i
began
to
want
greatly
but
minima
had
thrown
herself
upon
the
low
and
i
could
not
persuade
her
to
swallow
more
than
a
few
spoonfuls
of
soup
i
toot
off
her
damp
clothes
and
laid
her
down
comfortably
to
rest
her
eyes
were
dull
and
heavy
and
she
said
her
head
was
aching
but
she
looked
up
at
me
with
a
faint
smile
i
told
you
how
nice
it
would
be
to
be
in
bed
she
whispered
it
was
not
long
before
i
was
also
sleeping
soundly
the
deep
dreamless
sleep
which
comes
to
any
one
as
strong
as
i
was
after
unusual
physical
exertion
once
or
twice
a
vague
impression
forced
itself
upon
me
that
minima
was
talking
a
great
deal
in
her
dreams
it
was
the
clang
of
the
bell
for
matins
which
fully
roused
me
at
last
but
it
was
a
minute
or
two
before
i
could
make
out
where
i
was
through
the
uncurtained
window
high
in
the
opposite
wall
i
could
see
a
dim
pallid
moon
sinking
slowly
into
the
west
the
thick
beams
of
the
cross
were
strongly
delineated
against
its
pale
light
for
a
moment
i
fancied
that
minima
and
i
had
passed
the
night
under
the
shelter
of
the
solitary
image
which
we
had
left
alone
in
the
dark
and
rainy
evening
i
knew
better
immediately
and
lay
still
listening
to
the
tramp
of
the
wooden
hurrying
past
the
door
into
the
then
minima
began
to
talk
how
funny
that
is
she
said
there
the
boys
run
and
i
ca
catch
one
of
them
father
temple
secundus
is
pulling
faces
at
me
and
all
the
boys
are
laughing
well
it
does
matter
does
it
only
we
are
so
poor
aunt
nelly
and
all
we
so
poor
so
poor
so
poor
her
voice
fell
into
a
murmur
too
low
for
me
to
hear
what
she
was
saying
though
she
went
on
talking
rapidly
and
laughing
and
sobbing
at
times
i
called
to
her
but
she
did
not
answer
what
could
ail
the
child
i
went
to
her
and
took
her
hands
in
mine
burning
little
hands
i
said
minima
and
she
turned
to
me
with
a
caressing
gesture
raising
her
hot
fingers
to
stroke
my
face
yes
aunt
nelly
how
poor
we
are
you
and
me
i
am
so
tired
and
the
prince
never
comes
there
was
hardly
room
for
me
in
the
narrow
bed
but
i
managed
to
lie
down
beside
her
and
took
her
into
my
arms
to
soothe
her
she
rested
there
quietly
enough
but
her
head
was
wandering
and
all
her
whispered
chatter
was
about
the
boys
and
the
dominie
her
father
and
the
happy
days
at
home
in
the
school
in
epping
forest
as
soon
as
it
was
light
i
dressed
myself
in
haste
and
opened
my
door
to
see
if
i
could
find
any
one
to
send
to
monsieur
laurentie
the
first
person
i
saw
was
himself
coming
in
my
direction
i
had
not
fairly
looked
at
him
before
for
i
had
seen
him
only
by
twilight
and
firelight
his
cassock
was
old
and
threadbare
and
his
hat
brown
his
hair
fell
in
rather
long
locks
below
his
hat
and
was
beautifully
white
his
face
was
like
that
of
a
man
who
lived
much
and
his
clear
quick
eyes
shone
with
a
kindly
light
i
ran
impulsively
to
meet
him
with
outstretched
hands
which
he
took
into
his
own
with
a
pleasant
smile
oh
come
monsieur
i
cried
make
haste
she
is
ill
my
poor
minima
the
smile
faded
away
from
his
face
in
an
instant
and
he
did
not
utter
a
word
he
followed
me
quickly
to
the
side
of
the
little
bed
laid
his
hand
softly
on
the
child
forehead
and
felt
her
pulse
he
lifted
up
her
head
gently
and
opening
her
mouth
looked
at
her
tongue
and
throat
he
shook
his
head
as
he
turned
to
me
with
a
grave
and
perplexed
expression
and
he
spoke
with
a
low
solemn
accent
madame
he
said
it
is
the
fever
chapter
the
thirteenth
a
the
fever
what
fever
was
it
any
thing
more
than
some
childish
malady
brought
on
by
exhaustion
i
stood
silent
in
amazement
at
his
solemn
manner
and
looking
from
him
to
the
delirious
child
he
was
the
first
to
speak
again
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
go
he
said
the
child
can
not
be
removed
i
must
tell
jean
to
put
up
the
horse
and
à
again
i
shall
return
in
an
instant
to
you
madame
he
left
me
and
i
sank
down
on
a
chair
half
stupefied
by
this
new
disaster
it
would
be
necessary
to
stay
where
we
were
until
minima
recovered
yet
i
had
no
means
to
pay
these
people
for
the
trouble
we
should
give
them
and
the
expense
we
should
be
to
them
monsieur
le
curé
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
poor
parish
priest
with
a
very
small
income
i
had
not
time
to
decide
upon
any
course
however
before
he
returned
and
brought
with
him
his
sister
mademoiselle
thérèse
was
a
tall
plain
elderly
woman
but
with
the
same
pleasant
expression
of
open
friendliness
as
that
of
her
brother
she
went
through
precisely
the
same
examination
of
minima
as
he
had
done
the
fever
she
ejaculated
in
much
the
same
tone
as
his
they
looked
significantly
at
each
other
and
then
held
a
hurried
consultation
together
outside
the
door
after
which
the
curé
returned
alone
madame
he
said
this
child
is
not
your
own
as
i
supposed
last
night
my
sister
says
you
are
too
young
to
be
her
mother
is
she
your
sister
no
monsieur
i
answered
i
called
you
madame
because
you
were
travelling
alone
he
continued
smiling
french
demoiselles
never
travel
alone
before
they
are
married
you
are
mademoiselle
no
doubt
an
awkward
question
for
he
paused
as
if
it
were
a
question
i
look
into
his
kind
keen
face
and
honest
eyes
no
monsieur
i
said
frankly
i
am
married
where
then
is
your
husband
he
inquired
he
is
in
london
i
answered
monsieur
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
explain
it
i
can
not
speak
your
language
well
enough
i
think
in
english
and
i
can
not
find
the
right
french
words
i
am
very
unhappy
but
i
am
not
wicked
good
he
said
smiling
again
very
good
my
child
i
believe
you
you
will
learn
my
language
quickly
then
you
shall
tell
me
all
if
you
remain
with
us
but
you
said
the
is
not
your
sister
no
she
is
not
my
relative
at
all
i
replied
we
were
both
in
a
school
at
noireau
the
school
of
monsieur
emile
perrier
perhaps
you
know
it
monsieur
certainly
madame
he
said
he
has
failed
and
run
away
i
continued
all
the
pupils
are
dispersed
minima
and
i
were
returning
through
granville
bien
i
understand
madame
he
responded
but
it
is
villanous
this
affair
listen
my
child
i
have
much
to
say
to
you
do
i
speak
gently
and
slowly
enough
for
you
yes
i
answered
i
understand
you
perfectly
we
have
had
the
fever
in
for
some
weeks
he
went
on
it
is
now
bad
very
bad
yesterday
i
went
to
noireau
to
seek
a
doctor
but
i
could
only
hear
of
one
who
is
in
paris
at
present
and
can
not
come
immediately
when
you
prayed
me
for
succor
last
night
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
could
not
leave
you
by
the
with
the
night
coming
on
and
i
could
not
take
you
to
my
own
house
at
present
we
have
made
my
house
into
a
hospital
for
the
sick
my
people
bring
their
sick
to
me
and
we
do
our
best
and
put
our
trust
in
god
i
said
to
myself
and
to
jean
can
not
receive
these
children
into
the
presbytery
lest
they
should
take
the
fever
but
this
little
house
has
been
kept
free
from
all
infection
and
you
would
be
safe
here
for
one
night
so
i
hoped
the
must
have
caught
the
fever
some
days
ago
there
is
no
blame
therefore
resting
upon
me
you
understand
now
i
must
carry
her
into
my
little
hospital
but
you
madame
what
am
i
to
do
with
you
do
you
wish
to
go
on
to
granville
and
leave
the
with
me
we
will
take
care
of
her
as
a
little
angel
of
god
what
shall
i
do
with
you
my
child
monsieur
i
exclaimed
speaking
so
eagerly
that
i
could
scarcely
bring
my
sentences
into
any
kind
of
order
take
me
into
your
hospital
too
let
me
take
care
of
minima
and
your
other
sick
people
i
am
very
strong
and
in
good
health
i
am
never
ill
never
never
i
will
do
all
you
say
to
me
let
me
stay
dear
monsieur
but
your
husband
your
friends
he
said
i
have
no
friends
i
interrupted
and
my
husband
does
not
love
me
if
i
have
the
fever
and
die
good
very
good
i
am
not
wicked
i
am
a
christian
i
hope
only
let
me
stay
with
minima
and
do
all
i
can
in
the
hospital
he
stood
looking
at
me
scrutinizingly
trying
to
read
i
fancied
if
there
were
any
sign
of
wickedness
in
my
face
i
felt
it
flush
but
i
would
not
let
my
eyes
sink
before
his
i
think
he
saw
in
them
in
my
steadfast
tearful
eyes
that
i
might
be
unfortunate
but
that
i
was
not
wicked
a
pleasant
gleam
came
across
his
features
be
content
my
child
he
said
you
shall
stay
with
us
i
felt
a
sudden
sense
of
contentment
take
possession
of
me
for
here
was
work
for
me
to
do
as
well
as
a
refuge
neither
should
i
be
compelled
to
leave
minima
i
wrapped
her
up
warmly
in
the
blankets
and
monsieur
laurentie
lifted
her
carefully
and
tenderly
from
the
low
bed
he
told
me
to
accompany
him
and
we
crossed
the
court
and
entered
the
house
by
the
door
i
had
seen
the
night
before
a
staircase
of
red
quarries
led
up
to
the
second
story
and
the
first
door
we
came
to
was
a
long
low
room
with
a
quarried
floor
which
had
been
turned
into
a
for
women
and
children
there
were
already
nine
beds
in
it
of
different
sizes
brought
with
the
patients
who
now
occupied
them
but
one
of
these
was
empty
i
learned
afterward
that
the
girl
to
whom
the
bed
belonged
had
died
the
day
before
during
the
curé
absence
and
was
going
to
be
buried
that
morning
in
a
cemetery
lying
in
a
field
on
the
side
of
the
valley
mademoiselle
thérèse
was
making
up
the
bed
with
homespun
linen
scented
with
rosemary
and
lavender
and
the
curé
laid
minima
down
upon
it
with
all
the
skill
of
a
woman
in
this
ward
i
took
up
my
work
as
nurse
it
was
work
that
seemed
to
come
naturally
to
me
as
if
i
had
a
special
gift
for
it
i
remembered
how
some
of
the
older
shepherds
on
the
station
at
home
used
to
praise
my
mother
skill
as
a
nurse
i
felt
as
if
i
knew
by
instinct
the
wants
of
my
little
patients
when
they
could
not
put
them
into
coherent
words
for
themselves
they
were
mostly
children
or
quite
young
girls
for
the
older
people
who
were
stricken
by
the
fever
generally
clung
to
their
own
homes
and
the
curé
visited
them
there
with
the
regularity
of
a
physician
i
liked
to
find
for
these
suffering
children
a
more
comfortable
position
when
they
were
weary
or
to
bathe
their
burning
heads
with
some
cool
lotion
or
to
give
the
parched
lips
the
mademoiselle
thérèse
prepared
even
the
delirium
of
these
little
creatures
was
but
a
babbling
about
playthings
and
and
games
minima
whose
fever
took
faster
hold
of
her
day
after
day
prattled
of
the
same
things
in
english
only
with
sad
alternations
of
moaning
over
our
poverty
it
was
probably
these
lamentations
of
minima
which
made
me
sometimes
look
forward
with
dread
to
the
time
when
this
season
of
my
life
should
be
ended
i
knew
it
could
be
only
for
a
little
while
an
interlude
a
brief
passing
term
which
must
run
quickly
to
its
conclusion
and
bring
me
face
to
face
again
with
the
terrible
poverty
which
the
child
bemoaned
in
words
no
one
could
understand
but
myself
already
my
own
appearance
was
changing
as
mademoiselle
thérèse
supplied
the
place
of
my
clothing
which
wore
out
with
my
constant
work
replacing
it
with
the
homely
costume
of
the
norman
village
i
could
not
expect
to
remain
here
when
my
task
was
done
the
presbytery
was
too
poor
to
offer
me
a
shelter
when
i
could
be
nothing
but
a
burden
in
it
this
good
curé
who
was
growing
fonder
of
me
every
day
and
whom
i
had
learned
to
love
and
honor
could
not
be
a
father
to
me
as
he
was
to
his
own
people
sooner
or
later
there
would
come
an
hour
when
we
must
say
adieu
to
one
another
and
i
must
go
out
once
again
to
confront
the
uncertain
future
but
for
the
present
these
fears
were
very
much
in
the
background
and
i
only
felt
that
they
were
lurking
there
ready
for
any
moment
of
depression
i
was
kept
too
busy
with
the
duties
of
the
hour
to
attend
to
them
some
of
the
children
died
and
i
grieved
over
them
some
recovered
sufficiently
to
be
removed
to
a
farm
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
where
the
air
was
fresher
than
in
the
valley
there
was
plenty
to
do
and
to
think
of
from
day
to
day
chapter
the
fourteenth
outcast
parishioners
madame
said
monsieur
laurentie
one
morning
the
eighth
that
i
had
been
in
the
village
you
did
not
take
a
promenade
yesterday
not
yesterday
monsieur
nor
the
day
before
yesterday
he
continued
no
monsieur
i
answered
i
dare
not
leave
minima
i
fear
she
is
going
to
die
my
voice
failed
me
as
i
spoke
to
him
i
was
sitting
down
for
a
few
minutes
on
a
low
seat
between
minima
bed
and
one
where
a
little
boy
of
six
years
of
age
lay
both
were
delirious
he
was
the
little
son
of
jean
our
driver
and
the
sacristan
of
the
church
and
his
father
had
brought
him
into
the
ward
the
evening
of
the
day
after
minima
had
been
taken
jean
had
besought
me
with
tears
to
be
good
to
his
child
the
two
had
engrossed
nearly
all
my
time
and
thoughts
and
i
was
losing
heart
and
hope
every
hour
monsieur
laurentie
raised
me
gently
from
my
low
chair
and
seated
himself
upon
it
with
a
smile
as
he
looked
up
at
me
madame
he
said
i
promise
not
to
quit
the
chamber
till
you
return
my
sister
has
a
little
commission
for
you
to
do
confide
the
to
me
and
make
your
promenade
in
peace
it
is
necessary
madame
you
must
obey
me
the
commission
for
mademoiselle
was
to
carry
some
food
and
medicine
to
a
cottage
lower
down
the
valley
and
jean
eldest
son
pierre
was
appointed
to
be
my
guide
both
the
curé
and
his
sister
gave
me
a
strict
charge
as
to
what
we
were
to
do
neither
of
us
was
upon
any
account
to
go
near
or
enter
the
dwelling
but
after
the
basket
was
deposited
upon
a
flat
stone
which
pierre
was
to
point
out
to
me
he
was
to
ring
a
small
which
he
carried
with
him
for
that
purpose
then
we
were
to
turn
our
backs
and
begin
our
retreat
before
any
person
came
out
of
the
infected
house
i
set
out
with
pierre
a
boy
of
about
twelve
years
of
age
who
cast
upon
me
sidelong
glances
of
silent
scrutiny
we
passed
down
the
village
street
with
its
houses
forming
a
very
nest
for
fever
until
we
reached
the
road
by
which
i
had
first
entered
now
that
i
could
see
it
by
daylight
the
valley
was
extremely
narrow
and
the
hills
on
each
side
so
high
that
though
the
sun
had
risen
nearly
three
hours
ago
it
had
but
just
climbed
above
the
brow
of
the
eastern
slope
there
was
a
luxurious
and
dank
growth
of
trees
with
a
tangle
of
underwood
and
boggy
soil
beneath
them
a
vapor
was
shining
in
rainbow
colors
against
the
brightening
sky
in
the
depth
of
the
valley
but
hidden
by
the
thicket
ran
a
noisy
stream
too
noisy
to
be
any
thing
else
than
shallow
there
had
been
no
frost
since
the
sharp
and
keen
wintry
weather
in
december
and
the
heavy
rains
which
had
fallen
since
had
flooded
the
stream
and
made
the
lowlands
soft
and
oozy
with
undrained
moisture
my
guide
and
i
trudged
along
in
silence
for
almost
a
kilometre
are
you
a
pagan
madame
inquired
pierre
at
last
with
eager
solemnity
of
face
and
voice
his
blue
eyes
were
fastened
upon
me
pityingly
no
pierre
i
replied
but
you
are
a
heretic
he
pursued
i
suppose
so
i
said
pagans
and
heretics
are
the
same
he
rejoined
dogmatically
you
are
a
heretic
therefore
you
are
a
pagan
madame
i
am
not
a
pagan
i
persisted
i
am
a
christian
like
you
does
monsieur
le
curé
say
you
are
a
christian
he
inquired
you
can
ask
him
pierre
i
replied
he
will
know
he
said
in
a
confident
tone
he
knows
every
thing
there
is
no
curé
like
monsieur
between
and
paris
all
the
world
must
acknowledge
that
he
is
our
priest
our
doctor
our
de
our
did
you
ever
know
a
curé
like
him
before
madame
i
never
knew
any
curé
before
i
replied
never
knew
any
cure
he
repeated
slowly
then
madame
you
must
be
a
pagan
did
you
never
confess
were
you
never
prepared
for
your
first
communion
oh
it
is
certain
madame
you
are
a
true
pagan
we
had
not
any
more
time
to
discuss
my
religion
for
we
were
drawing
near
the
end
of
our
expedition
above
the
tops
of
the
trees
appeared
a
tall
chimney
and
a
sudden
turn
in
the
we
had
taken
brought
us
full
in
sight
of
a
small
built
on
the
banks
of
the
noisy
stream
it
was
an
ugly
formal
building
as
all
factories
are
with
straight
rows
of
but
both
walls
and
roof
were
mouldering
into
ruin
and
looked
as
though
they
must
before
long
sink
into
the
brawling
waters
that
were
sapping
the
foundations
a
more
place
i
had
never
seen
a
blight
seemed
to
have
fallen
upon
it
some
solemn
curse
might
be
brooding
over
it
and
slowly
working
out
its
total
destruction
in
the
yard
adjoining
this
deserted
factory
stood
a
miserable
cottage
with
a
thatched
roof
and
eaves
projecting
some
feet
from
the
walls
and
reaching
nearly
to
the
ground
except
where
the
door
was
the
small
casements
of
the
upper
story
if
there
were
any
were
completely
hidden
a
row
of
was
springing
up
green
and
glossy
along
the
peak
of
the
brown
thatch
this
and
the
picturesque
eaves
forming
its
only
beauty
the
thatch
looked
old
and
rotten
and
was
beginning
to
steam
in
the
warm
sunshine
the
unpaved
yard
about
it
was
a
slough
of
mire
and
mud
there
were
mould
and
mildew
upon
all
the
the
place
bore
the
aspect
of
a
shunned
by
all
the
inmates
of
the
neighboring
village
pierre
led
me
to
a
large
flat
stone
which
had
once
been
a
standing
at
a
safe
distance
from
this
hovel
and
i
laid
down
my
basket
upon
it
then
he
rang
his
noisily
and
the
next
instant
was
scampering
back
along
the
road
but
i
could
not
run
away
the
desolate
place
had
a
dismal
fascination
for
me
i
wondered
what
manner
of
persons
could
dwell
in
it
and
as
i
lingered
i
saw
the
low
door
opened
and
a
thin
spectral
figure
standing
in
the
gloom
within
but
delaying
to
cross
the
mouldering
as
long
as
i
remained
in
sight
in
another
minute
pierre
had
rushed
back
for
me
and
dragged
me
away
with
all
his
boyish
strength
and
energy
madame
he
said
in
angry
remonstrance
you
are
disobeying
monsieur
le
curé
if
you
catch
the
fever
and
die
while
you
are
a
pagan
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
go
to
heaven
it
would
be
a
hundred
times
better
for
me
to
die
who
have
taken
my
first
communion
but
who
lives
there
i
asked
they
are
very
wicked
people
he
answered
emphatically
no
one
goes
near
them
except
monsieur
le
curé
and
he
would
go
and
nurse
the
devil
himself
if
he
had
the
fever
in
his
parish
they
became
wicked
before
my
time
and
monsieur
le
curé
has
forbidden
us
to
speak
of
them
with
rancor
so
we
do
not
speak
of
them
at
all
i
walked
back
in
sadness
wondering
at
this
misery
and
solitariness
by
the
side
of
the
healthy
simple
society
of
the
lonely
village
with
its
interwoven
family
interests
as
i
passed
through
the
street
again
i
heard
the
click
of
the
in
most
of
the
dwellings
and
saw
the
weavers
in
their
white
and
tasselled
caps
here
a
man
and
there
a
woman
look
after
me
while
they
suspended
their
work
for
a
moment
every
door
was
open
the
children
ran
in
and
out
of
any
house
playing
together
as
if
they
were
of
one
family
the
women
were
knitting
in
companies
under
the
eaves
who
were
these
pariahs
whose
name
even
was
banished
from
every
tongue
i
must
ask
the
curé
himself
but
i
had
no
opportunity
that
day
when
i
returned
to
the
i
found
monsieur
laurentie
pacing
slowly
up
and
down
the
long
room
with
jean
little
son
in
his
arms
to
whom
he
was
singing
in
a
low
soft
voice
scarcely
louder
than
a
whisper
his
eyes
when
they
met
mine
were
glistening
with
tears
and
he
shook
his
head
mournfully
i
went
on
to
look
at
minima
she
was
lying
quiet
too
weak
and
exhausted
to
be
violent
but
chattering
all
the
time
in
rapid
childish
sentences
i
could
do
nothing
for
her
and
i
went
back
to
the
hearth
where
the
curé
was
now
standing
looking
sadly
at
the
child
in
his
arms
he
bade
me
sit
down
on
a
tabouret
that
stood
there
and
laid
his
little
burden
on
my
lap
the
child
has
no
mother
madame
he
said
let
him
die
in
a
arms
i
had
never
seen
any
one
die
not
even
my
father
and
i
shrank
from
seeing
it
but
the
small
white
face
rested
helplessly
against
my
arm
and
the
blue
eyes
unclosed
for
a
moment
and
gazed
into
mine
almost
with
a
smile
monsieur
laurentie
called
in
jean
and
pierre
and
they
knelt
before
us
in
silence
broken
only
by
sobs
in
the
room
there
were
children
voices
talking
about
their
toys
and
calling
to
one
another
in
shrill
feverish
accents
how
many
deaths
such
as
this
was
i
to
witness
monsieur
le
curé
murmured
the
failing
voice
of
the
little
child
what
is
it
my
little
one
he
said
stooping
over
him
shall
i
play
sometimes
with
the
little
child
jesus
the
words
fell
one
by
one
from
the
feeble
lips
yes
yes
the
holy
child
jesus
knows
what
little
children
need
answered
the
curé
he
is
always
good
and
wise
whispered
the
dying
child
so
good
so
wise
how
quickly
it
was
over
after
that
chapter
the
fifteenth
a
taciturn
frenchwoman
minima
was
so
much
worse
that
night
that
monsieur
laurentie
gave
me
permission
to
sit
up
with
mademoiselle
thérèse
to
watch
beside
her
there
was
a
kindly
and
unselfish
disposition
about
monsieur
le
curé
which
it
was
impossible
to
resist
or
even
gainsay
his
own
share
of
the
trouble
anxiety
and
grief
was
so
large
that
he
seemed
to
stand
above
us
all
and
be
naturally
our
director
and
ruler
but
when
i
begged
to
stay
with
minima
he
conceded
the
point
without
a
word
mademoiselle
thérèse
was
the
most
silent
woman
i
ever
met
she
could
pass
a
whole
day
without
uttering
a
word
and
did
not
seem
to
suffer
any
from
her
silence
in
the
house
she
wore
always
like
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
village
men
and
women
soundless
felt
socks
which
slipped
readily
into
the
wooden
used
for
walking
i
was
beginning
to
learn
to
walk
in
myself
for
the
time
was
drawing
rapidly
near
when
otherwise
i
should
be
barefoot
with
this
taciturn
frenchwoman
i
entered
upon
my
by
minima
whose
raving
no
one
could
understand
but
myself
the
long
dark
hours
seemed
interminable
mademoiselle
sat
knitting
a
pair
of
gray
stockings
in
the
intervals
of
attendance
upon
our
patients
the
subdued
glimmer
of
the
the
ticking
of
the
clock
the
chimes
every
quarter
of
an
hour
from
the
all
conspired
to
make
me
restless
and
almost
nervous
mademoiselle
i
said
at
last
talk
to
me
i
can
not
bear
this
tranquillity
tell
me
something
what
can
i
tell
you
madame
she
inquired
in
a
pleasant
tone
tell
me
about
those
people
i
saw
this
morning
i
answered
it
is
a
long
history
she
said
her
face
kindling
as
if
this
were
a
topic
that
excited
her
and
she
rolled
up
her
knitting
as
though
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
continue
that
while
she
was
talking
all
the
world
knows
it
here
and
we
never
talk
of
it
now
bat
you
are
a
stranger
shall
i
tell
it
you
i
had
hit
upon
the
only
subject
that
could
unlock
her
lips
it
was
the
too
at
night
one
is
naturally
more
communicative
than
in
the
broad
light
of
day
madame
she
said
in
an
agitated
voice
you
have
observed
already
that
my
brother
is
not
like
other
curés
he
has
his
own
ideas
his
own
sentiments
everybody
knows
him
at
this
moment
as
the
good
curé
of
but
when
he
came
here
first
thirty
years
ago
all
the
world
called
him
infidel
heretic
atheist
it
was
because
he
would
make
many
changes
in
the
church
and
parish
the
church
had
been
famous
for
miracles
but
francis
did
not
believe
in
them
and
he
would
not
encourage
them
there
used
to
be
pilgrimages
to
it
from
all
the
country
round
and
crowds
of
pilgrims
who
spend
much
money
there
was
a
great
number
of
crutches
left
at
the
shrine
of
the
virgin
by
cripples
who
had
come
here
by
their
help
but
walked
away
without
them
he
cleared
them
all
away
and
called
them
rubbish
so
every
one
said
he
was
an
infidel
you
understand
i
understand
it
very
well
i
said
bien
at
that
time
there
was
one
family
richer
than
all
the
others
they
were
the
proprietors
of
the
factory
down
yonder
and
everybody
submitted
to
them
there
was
a
daughter
not
married
but
very
dévote
i
have
been
dévote
myself
i
was
coquette
till
i
was
then
i
became
dévote
it
is
easier
than
being
a
simple
christian
like
my
brother
the
curé
mademoiselle
pineau
was
accustomed
to
have
visions
ecstasies
sometimes
the
angels
lifted
her
from
the
ground
into
the
air
when
she
was
at
her
prayers
francis
did
not
like
that
he
was
young
and
she
came
very
often
to
the
confessional
and
told
him
of
these
visions
and
ecstasies
he
discouraged
them
and
enjoined
penances
upon
her
bref
she
grew
to
detest
him
and
she
was
quite
like
a
female
curé
in
the
parish
she
set
everybody
against
him
at
last
when
he
removed
all
the
plaster
images
of
the
saints
and
would
have
none
but
wood
or
stone
she
had
him
cited
to
answer
for
it
to
his
bishop
but
what
did
he
do
that
for
i
asked
seeing
no
difference
between
plaster
images
and
those
of
wood
or
stone
madame
these
normans
are
ignorant
and
very
superstitious
she
replied
they
thought
a
little
powder
from
one
of
the
saints
would
cure
any
malady
some
of
the
images
were
away
with
having
powder
scraped
off
them
my
brother
would
not
hold
with
such
follies
and
his
bishop
told
him
he
might
fight
the
battle
out
if
he
could
no
one
thought
he
could
but
they
did
not
know
francis
it
was
a
terrible
battle
madame
nobody
would
come
to
the
confessional
and
every
month
or
so
he
was
compelled
to
have
a
vicaire
from
some
other
parish
to
receive
the
confessions
of
his
people
mademoiselle
pineau
fanned
the
flame
and
she
had
the
reputation
of
a
saint
but
how
did
it
end
i
inquired
mademoiselle
face
was
all
aglow
and
her
voice
rose
and
fell
in
her
excitement
yet
she
lingered
over
the
story
as
if
reluctant
to
lose
the
rare
pleasure
of
telling
it
in
brief
madame
she
resumed
there
was
a
terrible
conflagration
in
the
village
you
perceive
that
all
our
houses
are
covered
with
tiles
in
those
days
the
roofs
were
of
thatch
very
old
and
very
dry
and
there
was
much
timber
in
the
walls
how
the
fire
began
the
good
god
alone
knows
it
was
a
sultry
day
in
july
the
river
was
almost
dry
and
there
was
no
hope
of
extinguishing
the
flames
they
ran
like
lightning
from
roof
to
roof
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
save
life
and
a
little
property
my
brother
threw
off
his
cassock
and
worked
like
hercules
the
pineaux
lived
then
close
by
the
presbytery
in
a
house
half
of
wood
which
blazed
like
tinder
there
was
nothing
comparable
to
it
in
all
the
village
a
domestic
suddenly
cried
out
that
mademoiselle
was
in
her
oratory
probably
in
a
trance
not
a
soul
dares
venture
through
the
flames
to
save
her
though
she
is
a
saint
monsieur
le
curé
hears
the
rumor
of
it
he
steps
in
through
the
doorway
through
which
the
smoke
is
rolling
walks
in
as
tranquilly
as
if
he
were
going
to
make
a
visit
as
pastor
he
is
lost
to
their
sight
not
a
man
stirs
to
look
after
his
own
house
bref
he
comes
back
to
the
day
his
brown
hair
all
singed
and
his
face
black
carrying
mademoiselle
in
his
arms
good
the
battle
is
finished
all
the
world
adores
him
continue
mademoiselle
i
pray
you
i
said
eagerly
do
not
leave
off
there
bien
monsieur
le
curé
and
his
unworthy
sister
had
a
small
fortune
which
was
spent
for
the
people
he
begged
for
them
he
worked
with
them
he
learned
to
do
many
things
to
help
them
he
lives
for
them
and
them
only
he
has
refused
to
leave
them
for
better
positions
they
are
not
ungrateful
they
love
him
they
lean
upon
him
but
the
pineaux
i
suggested
bah
i
had
forgotten
them
their
factory
was
burnt
at
the
same
time
it
is
more
than
a
kilometre
from
here
but
who
can
say
how
far
the
burning
thatch
might
be
carried
on
the
wind
it
was
insured
for
a
large
sum
in
a
bureau
in
paris
but
there
were
suspicions
raised
and
questions
asked
our
sacristan
jean
who
was
then
a
young
boy
affirmed
that
he
had
seen
some
one
carrying
a
lighted
torch
around
the
building
after
the
had
all
fled
to
see
after
their
own
houses
the
bureau
refused
to
pay
except
by
a
process
of
law
and
the
pineaux
never
began
their
process
they
worked
the
factory
a
few
years
on
borrowed
money
but
they
became
poor
very
poor
mademoiselle
ceased
to
be
dévote
and
did
not
come
near
the
church
or
the
confessional
again
now
they
are
despised
and
destitute
not
a
person
goes
near
them
except
my
good
brother
whom
they
hate
still
there
remain
but
three
of
them
the
old
monsieur
who
is
very
aged
a
son
and
mademoiselle
who
is
as
old
as
myself
the
son
has
the
fever
and
francis
visits
him
almost
every
day
it
is
a
wretched
dreadful
place
i
said
shuddering
at
the
remembrance
of
it
they
will
die
there
probably
she
remarked
in
a
quiet
voice
and
with
an
expression
of
some
weariness
now
the
tale
was
told
my
brother
refuses
to
let
me
go
to
see
them
mademoiselle
hates
me
because
in
some
part
i
have
taken
her
place
francis
says
there
is
work
enough
for
me
at
home
madame
i
believe
the
good
god
sent
you
here
to
help
us
chapter
the
sixteenth
sent
by
god
i
discovered
that
mademoiselle
opinion
was
shared
by
all
the
people
in
and
monsieur
laurentie
favored
the
universal
impression
i
had
been
sent
to
them
by
a
special
providence
there
was
something
satisfactory
and
consolatory
to
them
all
in
my
freedom
from
personal
anxieties
and
cares
like
their
own
i
had
neither
parent
nor
husband
nor
child
to
be
attacked
by
the
prevailing
infection
as
soon
as
minima
had
passed
safely
through
the
most
dangerous
stages
of
the
fever
i
was
at
leisure
to
listen
to
and
sympathize
with
each
one
of
them
possibly
there
was
something
in
the
difficulty
i
still
experienced
in
expressing
myself
fluently
which
made
me
a
better
listener
and
so
won
them
to
pour
out
their
troubles
into
my
attentive
ear
jean
and
pierre
especially
were
devoted
to
me
since
the
child
that
had
belonged
to
them
had
died
upon
my
lap
through
march
april
and
may
the
fever
had
its
fling
though
we
were
not
very
long
without
a
doctor
monsieur
laurentie
found
one
who
came
and
i
suppose
did
all
he
could
for
the
sick
but
he
could
not
do
much
i
was
kept
too
busily
occupied
to
brood
much
either
upon
the
past
or
the
future
of
my
own
life
not
a
thought
crossed
my
mind
of
deserting
the
little
norman
village
where
i
could
be
of
use
besides
minima
gained
strength
very
slowly
too
slowly
to
be
removed
from
the
place
or
to
encounter
any
fresh
privations
when
june
came
there
were
no
new
cases
in
the
village
though
the
kept
our
patients
languid
the
last
person
who
died
of
the
fever
was
mademoiselle
pineau
in
the
the
old
man
and
his
son
had
died
before
her
the
former
of
old
age
the
latter
of
fever
who
was
the
heir
to
the
ruined
factory
and
the
empty
cottage
no
one
as
yet
knew
but
until
he
appeared
every
thing
had
to
be
left
as
it
was
the
curé
kept
the
key
of
the
dwelling
though
there
was
no
danger
of
any
one
trespassing
upon
the
premises
as
all
the
villagers
regarded
it
as
an
accursed
place
of
the
four
hundred
and
souls
which
had
formed
the
total
of
monsieur
le
curé
flock
he
had
lost
in
july
the
doctor
left
us
saying
there
was
no
fear
of
the
fever
breaking
out
again
at
present
his
departure
seemed
the
signal
for
mine
monsieur
laurentie
was
not
rich
enough
to
feed
two
idle
mouths
like
mine
and
minima
and
there
was
little
for
me
to
do
but
sit
still
in
the
uncarpeted
of
the
presbytery
listening
to
the
whirr
of
mademoiselle
and
the
drowsy
hum
of
the
village
children
at
school
in
a
shed
against
the
walls
of
the
house
every
thing
seemed
falling
back
into
the
pleasant
monotony
of
a
peaceful
country
life
pleasant
after
the
terror
and
grief
of
the
past
months
the
was
over
and
the
the
corn
and
the
apples
were
ripening
fast
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
in
this
lull
this
pause
my
heart
grew
busy
again
with
itself
my
child
said
the
curé
to
me
one
evening
when
his
long
day
work
was
over
your
face
is
what
are
you
thinking
of
i
was
seated
under
a
sycamore
a
few
paces
from
the
vespers
were
just
ended
the
low
chant
had
reached
my
ears
and
i
missed
the
soothing
undertone
the
women
in
their
high
white
caps
and
the
men
in
their
blue
blouses
were
sauntering
slowly
homeward
the
children
were
playing
all
down
the
village
street
and
not
far
away
a
few
girls
and
young
men
were
beginning
to
dance
to
the
piping
of
a
flute
over
the
whole
was
creeping
the
golden
twilight
of
a
summer
evening
i
am
very
i
replied
i
am
thinking
that
it
is
time
for
me
to
go
away
from
you
all
i
can
not
stay
in
this
tranquil
place
but
wherefore
must
you
leave
us
he
asked
sitting
down
on
the
bench
beside
me
i
found
two
little
stray
lambs
wandering
without
fold
or
shepherd
and
i
brought
them
to
my
own
house
what
compels
them
to
go
into
the
wide
world
again
monsieur
we
are
poor
i
answered
and
you
are
not
rich
we
should
be
a
burden
to
you
and
we
have
no
claim
upon
you
you
have
a
great
claim
he
said
there
is
not
a
heart
in
the
parish
that
does
not
love
you
already
have
not
our
children
died
in
your
arms
have
you
not
watched
over
them
spent
sleepless
nights
and
watchful
days
for
them
how
could
we
endure
to
see
you
go
away
remain
with
us
madame
live
with
us
you
and
my
whose
face
is
white
yet
could
i
stay
then
it
was
a
very
calm
very
secure
refuge
there
was
no
danger
of
discovery
yet
there
was
a
restlessness
in
my
spirit
at
war
with
the
serenity
of
the
place
where
i
had
seen
so
many
people
die
and
where
there
were
so
many
new
graves
in
the
little
cemetery
up
the
hill
if
i
could
go
away
for
a
while
i
might
return
and
learn
to
be
content
amid
this
tranquillity
madame
said
the
pleasant
tones
of
monsieur
laurentie
do
you
know
our
language
well
enough
to
tell
me
your
history
now
you
need
not
prove
to
me
that
you
are
not
wicked
tell
me
how
you
are
unfortunate
where
were
you
wandering
to
that
night
when
i
found
you
at
the
foot
of
the
calvary
there
in
the
cool
deepening
twilight
i
told
him
my
story
little
by
little
sometimes
at
a
loss
for
words
and
always
compelled
to
speak
in
the
simplest
and
most
direct
phrases
he
listened
with
no
other
interruption
than
to
supply
me
occasionally
with
an
expression
when
i
hesitated
he
appeared
to
understand
me
almost
by
intuition
it
was
quite
dark
before
i
had
finished
and
the
deep
blue
of
the
sky
above
us
was
bright
with
stars
a
was
moving
among
the
tufts
of
grass
growing
between
the
roots
of
the
tree
and
i
watched
it
almost
as
intently
as
if
i
had
nothing
else
to
think
of
speak
to
me
as
if
i
were
your
daughter
i
said
have
i
done
right
or
wrong
would
you
give
me
up
to
him
if
he
came
to
claim
me
i
am
thinking
of
thee
as
my
daughter
he
answered
leaning
his
hands
and
his
white
head
above
them
upon
the
top
of
the
stick
he
was
holding
and
sitting
so
for
some
moments
in
silent
thought
thy
voice
is
not
the
voice
of
passion
he
continued
it
is
the
voice
of
conviction
profound
and
confirmed
thou
mayst
have
fled
from
him
in
a
paroxysm
of
wrath
but
thy
judgment
and
conscience
acquit
thee
of
wrong
in
my
eyes
it
is
a
sacrament
which
thou
hast
broken
yet
he
had
profaned
it
first
my
daughter
if
thy
husband
returned
to
thee
penitent
converted
confessing
his
offences
against
thee
couldst
thou
forgive
him
yes
i
answered
yes
i
could
forgive
him
thou
wouldst
return
to
him
he
said
in
calm
penetrating
accents
but
so
low
as
to
seem
almost
the
voice
of
my
own
heart
thou
wouldst
be
subject
to
him
as
the
church
is
subject
to
christ
he
would
be
thy
head
wouldst
thou
submit
thyself
unto
him
as
unto
the
lord
i
shivered
with
dread
as
the
quiet
solemn
tones
fell
upon
my
ear
poignantly
as
if
they
must
penetrate
to
my
heart
i
could
not
keep
myself
from
sobbing
his
face
was
turned
toward
me
in
the
dusk
and
i
covered
mine
with
my
hands
not
now
i
cried
i
can
not
i
can
not
i
was
so
young
monsieur
i
did
not
know
what
i
was
promising
i
could
never
return
to
him
never
my
daughter
pursued
the
inexorable
voice
beside
me
is
it
because
there
is
any
one
whom
thou
lovest
more
oh
i
cried
almost
involuntarily
and
speaking
now
in
my
own
language
i
do
not
know
i
could
have
loved
martin
dearly
dearly
i
do
not
understand
thy
words
said
monsieur
laurentie
but
i
understand
thy
tears
and
sighs
thou
must
stay
here
my
daughter
with
me
and
these
poor
simple
people
who
love
thee
i
will
not
let
thee
go
into
temptation
courage
thou
wilt
be
happy
among
us
when
thou
hast
conquered
this
evil
as
for
the
rest
i
must
think
about
it
let
us
go
in
now
the
lamp
has
been
lit
and
supper
served
this
there
is
my
sister
looking
out
at
us
come
madame
you
are
in
my
charge
and
i
will
take
care
of
you
a
few
days
after
this
the
whole
community
was
thrown
into
a
tumult
by
the
news
that
their
curé
was
about
to
undertake
the
perils
of
a
voyage
to
england
and
would
be
absent
a
whole
fortnight
he
said
it
was
to
obtain
some
information
as
to
the
english
system
of
drainage
in
agricultural
districts
which
might
make
their
own
valley
more
healthy
and
less
liable
to
fever
but
it
struck
me
that
he
was
about
to
make
some
inquiries
concerning
my
husband
and
perhaps
about
minima
whose
desolate
position
had
touched
him
deeply
i
ventured
to
tell
him
what
danger
might
arise
to
me
if
any
clew
to
my
fell
into
richard
foster
hands
my
poor
child
he
said
why
art
thou
so
fearful
there
is
not
a
man
here
who
would
not
protect
thee
he
would
be
obliged
to
prove
his
identity
and
thine
before
he
could
establish
his
first
right
to
claim
thee
then
we
would
enter
a
be
content
i
am
going
to
consult
some
lawyers
of
my
own
country
and
thine
he
bade
us
farewell
with
as
many
directions
and
injunctions
as
a
father
might
leave
to
a
large
family
of
sons
and
daughters
half
the
village
followed
his
as
far
as
the
cross
where
he
had
found
minima
and
me
six
miles
on
his
road
to
noireau
his
sister
and
i
who
had
ridden
with
him
so
far
left
him
there
and
walked
home
up
the
steep
long
road
in
the
midst
of
that
enthusiastic
crowd
of
his
parishioners
chapter
the
seventeenth
a
moment
of
triumph
the
afternoon
of
that
day
was
unusually
sultry
and
oppressive
the
blue
of
the
sky
was
almost
livid
i
was
weary
with
the
long
walk
in
the
morning
and
after
our
meal
i
stole
away
from
mademoiselle
and
minima
in
the
and
betook
myself
to
the
cool
shelter
of
the
church
where
the
stone
walls
three
feet
thick
and
the
narrow
casements
covered
with
kept
out
the
heat
more
effectually
than
the
walls
of
the
presbytery
a
from
a
neighboring
parish
was
to
arrive
in
time
for
vespers
and
jean
and
pierre
were
polishing
up
the
interior
of
the
church
with
an
eye
to
their
own
credit
it
was
a
very
plain
simple
building
with
but
few
images
in
it
and
only
two
or
three
votive
pictures
very
ugly
hanging
between
the
low
norman
arches
of
the
windows
a
shrine
occupied
one
transept
and
before
it
the
offerings
of
flowers
were
daily
renewed
by
the
unmarried
girls
of
the
village
i
sat
down
upon
a
bench
just
within
the
door
and
the
transept
was
not
in
sight
but
i
could
hear
pierre
busy
at
his
task
of
polishing
the
oaken
floor
by
skating
over
it
with
brushes
fastened
to
his
feet
jean
was
bustling
in
and
out
of
the
sacristy
and
about
the
high
altar
in
the
chancel
there
was
a
faint
scent
yet
of
the
incense
which
had
been
burned
at
the
mass
celebrated
before
the
curé
departure
enough
to
make
the
air
heavy
and
to
deepen
the
drowsiness
and
languor
which
were
stealing
over
me
i
leaned
my
head
against
the
wall
and
closed
my
eyes
with
a
pleasant
sense
of
sleep
coming
softly
toward
me
when
suddenly
a
hand
was
laid
upon
my
arm
with
a
firm
close
silent
gripe
i
do
not
know
why
terror
always
strikes
me
dumb
and
motionless
i
did
not
stir
or
speak
but
looked
steadily
with
a
fascinated
gaze
into
my
husband
face
a
worn
white
emaciated
face
with
eyes
peering
cruelly
into
mine
it
was
an
awful
look
one
of
dark
triumph
of
sneering
cunning
exultation
neither
of
us
spoke
pierre
i
could
hear
still
busy
in
the
transept
and
jean
though
he
had
disappeared
into
the
sacristy
was
within
call
yet
i
felt
hopelessly
and
helplessly
alone
under
the
cruel
stare
of
those
eyes
it
seemed
as
if
he
and
i
were
the
only
beings
in
the
whole
world
and
there
was
none
to
help
none
to
rescue
in
the
voiceless
depths
of
my
spirit
i
cried
o
god
he
sank
down
on
the
seat
beside
me
with
an
air
of
exhaustion
yet
with
a
low
fiendish
laugh
which
sounded
hideously
loud
in
my
ears
his
fingers
were
still
about
my
arm
but
he
had
to
wait
to
recover
from
the
first
shock
of
his
success
for
it
had
been
a
shock
his
face
was
bathed
with
perspiration
and
his
breath
came
and
went
fitfully
i
thought
i
could
even
hear
the
heavy
throbbing
of
his
heart
he
spoke
after
a
time
while
my
eyes
were
still
fastened
upon
him
and
my
ears
listening
to
catch
the
first
words
he
uttered
i
found
you
he
said
his
hand
tightening
its
hold
and
at
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
the
spell
which
bound
me
snapped
i
tracked
you
out
at
last
to
this
cursed
hole
the
game
is
up
my
little
lady
by
heaven
you
repent
of
this
you
are
mine
and
no
man
on
earth
shall
come
between
us
i
do
understand
you
i
muttered
he
had
spoken
in
an
undertone
and
i
could
not
raise
my
voice
above
a
whisper
so
parched
and
dry
my
throat
was
understand
he
said
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
i
know
all
about
martin
dobrée
you
understand
that
well
enough
i
am
here
to
take
charge
of
you
to
carry
you
home
with
me
as
my
wife
and
neither
man
nor
woman
can
interfere
with
me
in
that
it
will
be
best
for
you
to
come
with
me
quietly
i
will
not
go
with
you
i
answered
in
the
same
hoarse
whisper
i
am
living
here
in
the
presbytery
and
you
can
not
force
me
away
i
will
not
go
he
laughed
a
little
once
more
and
looked
down
upon
me
contemptuously
in
silence
as
if
there
were
no
notice
to
be
taken
of
words
so
foolish
listen
to
me
i
continued
when
i
refused
to
sign
away
the
money
my
father
left
me
it
was
because
i
said
to
myself
it
was
wrong
to
throw
away
his
life
toil
and
skill
upon
pursuits
like
yours
he
had
worked
and
saved
and
denied
himself
for
me
not
for
a
man
like
you
his
money
should
not
be
flung
away
at
but
now
i
know
he
would
rather
a
thousand
times
you
had
the
money
and
left
me
free
take
it
then
you
shall
have
it
all
we
are
both
poor
as
it
is
but
if
you
will
let
me
be
free
of
you
you
may
have
it
all
all
that
i
can
part
with
i
prefer
having
the
money
and
you
he
replied
with
his
frightful
smile
why
should
i
not
prize
what
other
people
covet
you
are
my
wife
nothing
can
set
that
aside
your
money
is
mine
and
you
are
mine
why
should
i
forfeit
either
no
i
said
growing
calmer
i
do
not
belong
to
you
no
laws
on
earth
can
give
you
the
ownership
you
claim
over
me
richard
you
might
have
won
me
if
you
had
been
a
good
man
but
you
are
evil
and
selfish
and
you
have
lost
me
forever
the
silly
raving
of
an
ignorant
girl
he
sneered
the
law
will
compel
you
to
return
to
me
i
will
take
the
law
into
my
own
hands
and
compel
you
to
go
with
me
at
once
if
there
is
no
conveyance
to
be
hired
in
this
confounded
hole
we
will
walk
down
the
road
together
like
two
lovers
and
wait
for
the
omnibus
come
olivia
our
voices
had
not
risen
much
above
their
undertones
yet
but
these
last
words
he
spoke
more
loudly
jean
opened
the
door
of
the
sacristy
and
looked
out
and
pierre
skated
down
to
the
corner
of
the
transept
to
see
who
was
speaking
i
lifted
the
hand
richard
was
not
holding
and
beckoned
jean
to
me
jean
i
said
in
a
low
tone
still
this
man
is
my
enemy
monsieur
le
curé
knows
all
about
him
but
he
is
not
here
you
must
protect
me
certainly
madame
he
replied
his
eyes
more
roundly
open
than
monsieur
have
the
goodness
to
release
madame
she
is
my
wife
retorted
richard
foster
i
have
told
all
to
monsieur
le
curé
i
said
ejaculated
jean
monsieur
le
curé
is
gone
to
england
it
is
necessary
to
wait
till
his
return
monsieur
englishman
fool
said
richard
in
a
passion
she
is
my
wife
i
tell
you
he
replied
phlegmatically
but
it
is
my
affair
to
protect
madame
there
is
no
resource
but
to
wait
till
monsieur
le
curé
returns
from
his
voyage
if
madame
does
not
say
is
my
husband
how
can
i
believe
you
she
says
is
my
enemy
i
can
not
confide
madame
to
a
stranger
i
will
not
leave
her
he
exclaimed
with
an
oath
spoken
in
english
which
jean
could
not
understand
good
very
good
pardon
monsieur
responded
jean
laying
his
iron
fingers
upon
the
hand
that
held
me
and
loosening
its
grip
as
easily
as
if
it
had
been
the
hand
of
a
madame
you
are
free
leave
monsieur
the
englishman
to
me
and
go
away
into
the
house
if
you
please
i
did
not
wait
to
hear
any
further
altercation
but
fled
as
quickly
as
i
could
into
the
presbytery
up
into
my
own
chamber
i
ran
drew
a
heavy
chest
against
the
door
and
fell
down
trembling
and
nerveless
upon
the
floor
beside
it
but
there
was
no
time
to
lose
in
womanish
terrors
my
difficulty
and
danger
were
too
great
the
curé
was
gone
and
would
be
away
at
least
a
fortnight
how
did
i
know
what
french
law
might
do
with
me
in
that
time
i
dragged
myself
to
the
window
and
with
my
face
just
above
the
sill
looked
down
the
street
to
see
if
my
husband
were
in
sight
he
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
loitering
at
one
of
the
doors
was
the
whose
daily
work
it
was
to
meet
the
afternoon
omnibus
returning
from
noireau
to
granville
why
should
i
not
write
to
tardif
he
had
promised
to
come
to
my
help
whenever
and
wherever
i
might
summon
him
i
ran
down
to
mademoiselle
thérèse
for
the
materials
for
a
letter
and
in
a
few
minutes
it
was
written
and
on
the
way
to
sark
i
was
still
watching
intently
from
my
own
casement
when
i
saw
richard
foster
come
round
the
corner
of
the
church
and
turn
down
the
street
many
of
the
women
were
at
their
doors
and
he
stopped
to
speak
to
first
one
and
then
another
i
guessed
what
he
wanted
there
was
no
inn
in
the
valley
and
he
was
trying
to
hire
a
lodging
for
the
night
but
jean
was
following
him
closely
and
from
every
house
he
was
turned
away
baffled
and
disappointed
he
looked
weary
and
bent
and
he
leaned
heavily
upon
the
strong
stick
he
carried
at
last
he
passed
slowly
out
of
sight
and
once
more
i
could
breathe
freely
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
venture
downstairs
where
the
uncurtained
windows
were
level
with
the
court
and
the
unfastened
door
opened
to
my
hand
the
night
fell
while
i
was
still
alone
unnerved
by
the
terror
i
had
undergone
here
and
there
a
light
glimmered
in
a
but
a
deep
silence
reigned
with
no
other
sound
than
the
brilliant
song
of
a
nightingale
amid
the
trees
which
girdled
the
village
suddenly
there
was
the
noisy
rattle
of
wheels
over
the
rough
pavement
the
baying
of
dogs
an
indistinct
shout
from
the
few
men
who
were
still
smoking
their
pipes
under
the
broad
eaves
of
their
houses
a
horrible
dread
took
hold
of
me
was
it
possible
that
he
returned
with
some
force
i
knew
not
what
which
should
drag
me
away
from
my
refuge
and
give
me
up
to
him
what
would
jean
and
the
villagers
do
what
could
they
do
against
a
body
of
i
gazed
shrinkingly
into
the
darkness
the
conveyance
looked
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
of
its
shape
very
like
the
which
was
not
to
return
from
noireau
till
the
next
day
but
there
was
only
the
gleam
of
the
lantern
it
carried
on
a
pole
rising
above
its
roof
and
throwing
crossbeams
of
light
upon
the
walls
and
windows
on
each
side
of
the
street
it
came
on
rapidly
and
passed
quickly
out
of
my
sight
round
the
angle
of
the
presbytery
my
heart
scarcely
beat
and
my
ear
was
strained
to
catch
every
sound
in
the
house
below
i
heard
hurried
footsteps
and
joyous
voices
a
minute
or
two
afterward
minima
beat
against
my
barricaded
door
and
shouted
gleefully
through
the
come
down
in
a
minute
aunt
nelly
she
cried
monsieur
laurentie
is
come
home
again
chapter
the
eighteenth
pierre
secret
i
felt
as
if
some
strong
hand
had
lifted
me
out
of
a
whirl
of
troubled
waters
and
set
me
safely
upon
a
rock
i
ran
down
into
the
where
monsieur
laurentie
was
seated
as
tranquilly
as
if
he
had
never
been
away
in
his
smiling
quietly
at
gambols
of
delight
which
ended
in
her
sitting
down
on
a
at
his
feet
jean
stood
just
within
the
door
his
hands
behind
his
back
holding
his
white
cotton
cap
in
them
he
had
been
making
his
report
of
the
day
events
monsieur
held
out
his
hand
to
me
and
i
ran
to
him
caught
it
in
both
of
mine
bent
down
my
face
upon
it
and
burst
into
a
passion
of
weeping
in
spite
of
myself
come
come
madame
he
said
his
own
voice
faltering
a
little
i
am
here
my
child
behold
me
there
is
no
place
for
fear
now
i
am
king
in
is
it
not
so
my
good
jean
monsieur
le
curé
you
are
emperor
replied
jean
if
that
is
the
case
he
continued
madame
is
perfectly
secure
in
my
castle
you
do
not
ask
me
what
brings
me
back
again
so
soon
but
i
will
tell
you
madame
at
noireau
the
proprietor
of
the
omnibus
to
granville
told
me
that
an
englishman
had
gone
that
morning
to
visit
my
little
parish
good
we
do
not
have
that
honor
every
day
i
ask
him
to
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
the
englishman
name
it
is
written
in
the
book
at
the
bureau
monsieur
fostère
i
remember
that
name
well
very
well
that
is
the
name
of
the
husband
of
my
little
english
daughter
fostère
i
see
in
a
moment
it
will
not
do
to
proceed
on
my
voyage
but
i
find
that
my
good
jacques
has
taken
on
the
a
league
or
two
beyond
noireau
and
i
am
compelled
to
await
his
return
there
is
the
reason
that
i
return
so
late
o
monsieur
i
exclaimed
how
good
you
are
pardon
madame
he
interrupted
let
me
hear
the
end
of
history
jean
continued
his
report
in
his
usual
phlegmatic
tone
and
concluded
with
the
assurance
that
he
had
seen
the
englishman
safe
out
of
the
village
and
returning
by
the
road
he
came
i
could
have
wished
said
the
curé
regretfully
that
we
might
have
shown
him
some
hospitality
in
but
you
did
what
was
very
good
jean
yet
we
did
not
encounter
any
stranger
along
the
route
not
possible
monsieur
replied
jean
it
was
four
when
he
returned
on
his
steps
and
it
is
now
after
nine
he
would
pass
the
calvary
before
six
after
that
monsieur
le
curé
he
might
take
any
route
which
pleased
him
that
is
true
jean
he
said
mildly
you
have
done
well
you
may
go
now
where
is
monsieur
the
vicaire
he
sleeps
monsieur
in
the
guest
chamber
as
usual
jean
and
a
monsieur
le
curé
and
all
the
company
said
jean
and
you
also
my
child
continued
monsieur
laurentie
when
jean
was
gone
you
have
great
need
of
rest
so
has
this
baby
who
is
very
sleepy
i
am
not
sleepy
protested
minima
and
i
am
not
a
baby
you
are
a
baby
said
the
curé
laughing
to
make
such
rejoicing
over
an
old
papa
like
me
but
go
now
my
children
there
is
no
danger
for
you
sleep
well
and
have
pleasant
dreams
i
slept
well
but
i
had
no
pleasant
dreams
for
i
did
not
dream
at
all
the
curé
return
and
his
presence
under
the
same
roof
gave
me
such
a
sense
of
security
as
was
favorable
to
profound
unbroken
slumber
when
the
chirping
of
the
birds
awoke
me
in
the
morning
i
could
not
at
first
believe
that
the
events
of
the
day
before
were
not
themselves
a
dream
the
bell
rang
for
matins
at
five
now
to
give
the
laborers
the
cool
of
the
morning
for
their
work
in
the
fields
after
they
were
over
i
could
not
sleep
again
for
the
coming
hours
must
be
full
of
suspense
and
agitation
to
me
so
at
the
first
toll
of
the
bell
i
dressed
myself
and
went
out
into
the
dewy
freshness
of
the
new
day
matins
were
ended
and
the
villagers
were
scattered
about
their
farms
and
households
when
i
noticed
pierre
loitering
stealthily
about
the
presbytery
as
if
anxious
not
to
be
seen
he
made
me
a
sign
as
soon
as
he
caught
my
eye
to
follow
him
out
of
sight
round
the
corner
of
the
church
it
was
a
mysterious
sign
and
i
obeyed
it
quickly
i
know
a
secret
madame
he
said
in
a
troubled
tone
and
with
an
apprehensive
air
that
monsieur
who
came
yesterday
has
not
left
the
valley
my
father
bade
me
stay
in
the
church
at
my
work
but
i
could
not
madame
i
could
not
not
possible
you
know
i
wished
to
see
your
enemy
again
i
shall
have
to
confess
it
to
monsieur
le
curé
and
he
will
give
me
a
penance
perhaps
a
very
great
penance
but
it
was
not
possible
to
rest
tranquil
not
at
all
i
followed
monsieur
your
enemy
la
he
did
not
go
far
away
but
where
is
he
then
i
asked
looking
down
the
street
with
a
thrill
of
fear
madame
whispered
pierre
he
is
a
stranger
to
this
place
and
the
people
would
not
receive
him
into
their
houses
not
one
of
them
my
father
only
said
is
an
enemy
to
our
dear
english
madame
and
all
the
women
turned
the
back
upon
him
i
stole
after
him
you
know
behind
the
trees
and
the
hedges
he
marched
very
slowly
like
a
man
very
weary
down
the
road
till
he
came
in
sight
of
the
factory
of
the
late
pineaux
he
turned
aside
into
the
court
there
i
saw
him
knock
at
the
door
of
the
house
try
to
lift
the
latch
and
peep
through
the
windows
bien
after
that
he
goes
into
the
factory
there
is
a
door
from
it
into
the
house
he
passed
through
i
dared
not
follow
him
but
in
one
short
i
saw
smoke
coming
out
of
the
chimney
bon
the
smoke
is
there
again
this
morning
the
englishman
has
sojourned
there
all
the
night
but
pierre
i
said
shivering
though
the
sun
was
already
shining
hotly
pierre
the
house
is
like
a
lazaretto
no
one
has
been
in
it
since
mademoiselle
pineau
died
monsieur
le
curé
locked
it
up
and
brought
away
the
key
that
is
true
madame
answered
the
boy
no
one
in
the
village
would
go
near
the
accursed
place
but
i
never
thought
of
that
perhaps
monsieur
your
enemy
will
take
the
fever
and
perish
run
pierre
run
i
cried
monsieur
laurentie
is
in
the
sacristy
with
the
strange
vicaire
tell
him
i
must
speak
to
him
this
very
moment
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
i
dragged
myself
to
the
seat
under
the
and
hid
my
face
in
my
hands
while
shudder
after
shudder
quivered
through
me
i
seemed
to
be
watching
him
again
as
he
strode
weariedly
down
the
street
leaning
with
bent
shoulders
on
his
stick
and
turned
away
from
every
door
at
which
he
asked
for
rest
and
shelter
for
the
night
oh
that
the
time
could
but
come
back
again
that
i
might
send
jean
to
find
some
safe
place
for
him
where
he
could
sleep
back
to
my
memory
rushed
the
old
days
when
he
screened
me
from
the
unkindness
of
my
and
when
he
seemed
to
love
me
for
the
sake
of
those
times
would
to
god
the
evening
that
was
gone
and
the
sultry
breathless
night
could
only
come
back
again
chapter
the
nineteenth
suspense
i
felt
as
if
i
had
passed
through
an
immeasurable
spell
both
of
memory
and
anguish
before
monsieur
laurentie
came
to
me
though
he
had
responded
to
my
summons
immediately
i
told
him
in
hurried
broken
sentences
what
pierre
had
confessed
to
me
his
face
grew
overcast
and
troubled
yet
he
did
not
utter
a
word
of
his
apprehensions
to
me
madame
he
said
permit
me
to
take
my
breakfast
first
then
i
will
seek
monsieur
foster
without
delay
i
will
carry
with
me
some
food
for
him
we
will
arrange
this
affair
before
i
return
jean
shall
bring
the
à
to
the
factory
and
take
him
back
to
noireau
but
the
fever
monsieur
can
he
pass
a
night
there
without
taking
it
he
is
in
the
hands
of
his
creator
he
answered
we
can
know
nothing
till
i
have
seen
him
we
can
not
call
back
the
past
ought
i
not
to
go
with
you
i
asked
wherefore
my
child
he
is
my
husband
i
said
falteringly
if
he
is
ill
i
will
nurse
him
good
my
poor
child
he
replied
leave
all
this
affair
to
me
leave
even
thy
duty
to
me
i
will
take
care
there
shall
be
no
failure
in
it
on
thy
part
we
were
not
many
minutes
over
our
frugal
breakfast
of
and
then
we
set
out
together
for
he
gave
me
permission
to
go
with
him
until
we
came
within
sight
of
the
factory
and
the
cottage
we
walked
quickly
and
in
foreboding
silence
he
told
me
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
place
that
i
might
stay
on
the
spot
where
he
left
me
till
the
struck
eight
and
then
if
he
had
not
returned
to
me
i
must
go
back
to
the
village
and
send
jean
with
the
à
i
sat
down
on
the
felled
trunk
of
a
tree
and
watched
him
in
his
old
threadbare
cassock
and
sunburnt
hat
crossing
the
baked
cracked
soil
of
the
court
till
he
reached
the
door
and
turned
round
to
lift
his
hat
to
me
with
a
kindly
gesture
of
farewell
he
fitted
the
key
into
the
lock
passed
out
of
my
sight
but
i
could
not
withdraw
my
eyes
from
the
deep
thatched
eaves
and
glossy
growing
along
the
roof
how
interminable
seemed
his
absence
i
sat
so
still
that
the
crickets
and
grasshoppers
in
the
tufted
grass
about
me
kept
up
their
ceaseless
chirruping
and
leaped
about
my
feet
unaware
that
i
could
crush
their
merry
life
out
of
them
by
a
single
movement
the
birds
in
the
dusky
branches
overhead
whistled
their
wild
as
gayly
as
if
no
one
were
near
their
haunts
now
and
then
there
came
a
pause
when
the
silence
deepened
until
i
could
hear
the
cones
in
the
close
at
hand
snapping
open
their
polished
scales
and
setting
free
the
winged
seeds
which
fluttered
softly
down
to
the
ground
the
rustle
of
a
swiftly
gliding
snake
through
the
fallen
leaves
caught
my
ear
and
i
saw
the
blunted
head
and
glittering
eyes
lifted
up
to
look
at
me
for
a
moment
but
i
did
not
stir
all
my
fear
and
feeling
my
whole
life
were
centred
upon
the
yonder
there
was
not
the
faintest
line
of
smoke
from
the
chimney
when
we
first
came
in
sight
of
it
was
it
not
quite
possible
that
pierre
might
have
been
mistaken
and
if
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
thinking
he
saw
smoke
this
morning
why
not
last
night
also
yet
the
curé
was
lingering
there
too
long
for
it
to
be
merely
an
empty
place
something
detained
him
or
why
did
he
not
come
back
to
me
presently
a
thin
blue
smoke
curled
upward
into
the
still
air
monsieur
laurentie
was
kindling
a
fire
on
the
hearth
was
there
then
what
would
be
the
end
of
it
all
my
heart
contracted
and
my
spirit
shrank
from
the
answer
that
was
ready
to
flash
upon
my
mind
i
refused
to
think
of
the
end
if
richard
were
ill
why
i
would
nurse
him
as
i
should
have
nursed
him
if
he
had
always
been
tender
and
true
to
me
that
at
least
was
a
clear
duty
what
lay
beyond
that
need
not
be
decided
upon
now
monsieur
laurentie
would
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
do
he
came
after
a
long
long
suspense
and
opened
the
door
looking
out
as
if
to
make
sure
that
i
was
still
at
my
post
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
was
running
forward
when
he
beckoned
me
to
remain
where
i
was
he
came
across
to
the
middle
of
the
court
but
no
nearer
and
he
spoke
to
me
at
that
distance
in
his
clear
deliberate
penetrating
voice
my
child
he
said
monsieur
is
ill
attacked
i
am
afraid
by
the
fever
he
is
not
delirious
at
present
and
we
have
been
talking
together
of
many
things
but
the
fever
has
taken
hold
upon
him
i
think
i
shall
remain
with
him
all
the
day
you
must
bring
us
what
we
have
need
of
and
leave
it
on
the
stone
there
as
it
used
to
be
but
can
not
he
be
removed
at
once
i
asked
my
dear
he
answered
what
can
i
do
the
village
is
free
from
sickness
now
how
can
i
run
the
risk
of
carrying
the
fever
there
again
it
is
too
far
to
send
monsieur
to
noireau
if
he
is
ill
of
it
it
is
best
for
us
all
that
he
should
remain
here
i
will
not
abandon
him
no
no
obey
me
my
child
and
leave
him
to
me
and
to
god
can
not
you
confide
in
me
yet
yes
i
said
weeping
i
trust
you
with
all
my
heart
go
then
and
do
what
i
bid
you
he
replied
tell
my
sister
and
jean
tell
all
my
people
that
no
one
must
intrude
upon
me
no
one
must
come
nearer
this
house
than
the
appointed
place
monsieur
le
vicaire
must
remain
in
and
officiate
for
me
as
though
i
were
pursuing
my
journey
to
england
you
must
think
of
me
as
one
absent
yet
close
at
hand
that
is
the
difference
i
am
here
in
the
path
of
my
duty
go
and
fulfil
yours
ought
you
not
to
let
me
share
your
work
and
your
danger
i
ventured
to
ask
if
there
be
any
need
you
shall
share
both
he
answered
in
a
tranquil
tone
though
your
life
should
be
the
penalty
life
is
nothing
in
comparison
with
duty
when
it
is
thy
duty
my
daughter
to
be
beside
thy
husband
i
will
call
thee
without
fail
slowly
i
retraced
my
steps
to
the
village
the
news
had
already
spread
from
pierre
for
no
one
else
knew
it
that
the
englishman
who
had
been
turned
away
from
their
doors
the
day
before
had
spent
the
night
in
the
infected
dwelling
a
group
of
weavers
of
farmers
of
women
from
their
household
work
stopped
me
as
i
entered
the
street
i
delivered
to
them
their
curé
message
and
they
received
it
with
sobs
and
cries
as
though
it
bore
in
it
the
prediction
of
a
great
calamity
they
followed
me
up
the
street
to
the
presbytery
and
crowded
the
little
court
in
front
of
it
when
mademoiselle
had
collected
the
things
monsieur
laurentie
had
sent
me
for
a
mattress
a
chair
food
and
medicine
every
person
in
the
crowd
wished
to
carry
some
small
portion
of
them
we
returned
in
a
troop
to
the
factory
and
stood
beyond
the
stone
a
group
of
sorrowful
almost
despairing
people
in
a
few
minutes
we
saw
the
curé
open
the
door
close
it
behind
him
and
stand
before
the
proscribed
dwelling
his
voice
came
across
the
space
between
us
and
him
in
distinct
and
cheerful
tones
my
good
children
he
said
i
your
priest
forbid
any
one
of
you
to
come
a
single
step
nearer
to
this
house
it
may
be
but
for
a
day
or
two
but
let
no
one
venture
to
disobey
me
think
of
me
as
though
i
had
gone
to
england
and
should
be
back
again
among
you
in
a
few
days
god
is
here
as
near
to
me
under
this
roof
as
when
i
stand
before
him
and
you
at
his
altar
he
lifted
up
his
hands
to
give
them
his
benediction
and
we
all
knelt
to
receive
it
then
with
unquestioning
obedience
but
with
many
lamentations
the
people
returned
to
their
daily
work
chapter
the
twentieth
a
malignant
case
for
three
days
morning
after
morning
while
the
dew
lay
still
upon
the
grass
i
went
down
with
a
heavy
and
foreboding
heart
to
the
place
where
i
could
watch
the
cottage
through
the
long
sultry
hours
of
the
the
first
thing
i
saw
always
was
monsieur
laurentie
who
came
to
the
door
to
satisfy
me
that
he
was
himself
in
good
health
and
to
tell
me
how
richard
foster
had
passed
the
night
after
that
i
caught
from
time
to
time
a
momentary
glimpse
of
his
white
head
as
he
passed
the
dusky
window
he
would
not
listen
to
my
entreaties
to
be
allowed
to
join
him
in
his
task
it
was
a
malignant
case
he
said
and
as
my
husband
was
unconscious
i
could
do
him
no
good
by
running
the
risk
of
being
near
him
an
invisible
line
encircled
the
pestilential
place
which
none
of
us
dare
break
through
without
the
permission
of
the
curé
though
any
one
of
the
villagers
would
have
rejoiced
if
he
had
summoned
them
to
his
aid
a
perpetual
intercession
was
offered
up
day
and
night
before
the
high
altar
by
the
people
and
there
was
no
lack
of
eager
candidates
ready
to
take
up
the
prayer
when
the
one
who
had
been
praying
grew
weary
on
the
third
morning
i
felt
that
they
were
beginning
to
look
at
me
with
altered
faces
and
speak
to
me
in
colder
accents
if
i
were
the
means
of
bringing
upon
them
the
loss
of
their
curé
they
would
curse
the
day
he
found
me
and
brought
me
to
his
home
i
left
the
village
street
half
and
wandered
hopelessly
down
to
my
chosen
post
i
thought
i
was
alone
but
as
i
sat
with
my
head
bowed
down
upon
my
hands
i
felt
a
child
hand
laid
upon
my
neck
and
minima
voice
spoke
plaintively
in
my
ear
what
is
the
matter
aunt
nelly
she
asked
everybody
is
in
trouble
and
mademoiselle
says
it
is
because
your
husband
is
come
and
monsieur
laurentie
is
going
to
die
for
his
sake
she
began
to
cry
when
she
said
that
and
she
said
shall
we
all
do
if
my
brother
dies
my
god
what
will
become
of
all
the
people
in
is
it
true
is
your
husband
really
come
and
is
he
going
to
die
he
is
come
i
said
in
a
low
voice
i
do
not
know
whether
he
is
going
to
die
is
he
so
poor
that
he
will
die
she
asked
again
why
does
god
let
people
be
so
poor
that
they
must
die
it
is
not
because
he
is
so
poor
that
he
is
ill
i
answered
but
my
father
died
because
he
was
so
poor
she
said
the
doctors
told
him
he
could
get
well
if
he
had
only
enough
money
perhaps
your
husband
would
not
have
died
if
he
had
not
been
very
poor
no
no
i
cried
vehemently
he
is
not
dying
through
poverty
yet
the
child
words
had
a
sting
in
them
for
i
knew
he
had
been
poor
in
consequence
of
my
act
i
thought
of
the
close
unwholesome
house
in
london
where
he
had
been
living
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
it
and
wondering
whether
any
loss
of
vital
strength
born
of
poverty
had
caused
him
to
fall
more
easily
a
prey
to
this
fever
my
brain
was
burdened
with
sorrowful
questions
and
doubts
i
sent
minima
back
to
the
village
before
the
grew
strong
and
then
i
was
alone
watching
the
cottage
through
the
fine
haze
of
heat
which
hung
tremulously
about
it
the
song
of
every
bird
was
hushed
the
shouts
of
the
to
their
oxen
ceased
and
the
only
sound
that
stirred
the
still
air
was
the
monotonous
striking
of
the
clock
in
the
i
had
not
seen
monsieur
laurentie
since
his
first
greeting
of
me
in
the
early
morning
a
panic
fear
seized
upon
me
suppose
he
should
have
been
stricken
suddenly
by
this
deadly
malady
i
called
softly
at
first
then
loudly
but
no
answer
came
to
comfort
me
if
this
old
man
worn
out
and
exhausted
had
actually
given
his
life
for
richard
what
would
become
of
me
what
would
become
of
all
of
us
step
by
step
pausing
often
yet
urged
on
by
my
growing
fears
i
stole
down
the
parched
and
beaten
track
toward
the
house
then
called
once
more
to
the
oppressive
silence
here
in
the
open
sunshine
with
the
hot
walls
of
the
mill
casting
its
rays
back
again
the
heat
was
intense
though
the
white
cap
i
wore
protected
my
head
from
it
my
eyes
were
dazzled
and
i
felt
ready
to
faint
no
wonder
if
monsieur
laurentie
should
have
sunk
under
it
and
the
long
strain
upon
his
energies
which
would
have
overtaxed
a
younger
and
stronger
man
i
had
passed
the
invisible
line
which
his
will
had
drawn
about
the
place
and
had
half
crossed
the
court
when
i
heard
footsteps
close
behind
me
and
a
large
brown
rough
hand
suddenly
caught
mine
cried
a
voice
i
knew
well
is
this
you
o
tardif
tardif
i
exclaimed
i
rested
my
beating
head
against
him
and
sobbed
violently
while
he
surrounded
me
with
his
strong
arm
and
laid
his
hand
upon
my
head
as
if
to
assure
me
of
his
help
and
protection
hush
hush
he
said
it
is
tardif
your
friend
my
little
your
servant
you
know
i
am
here
what
shall
i
do
for
you
is
there
any
person
in
yonder
house
who
frightens
you
my
poor
little
tell
me
what
i
can
do
he
had
drawn
me
back
into
the
green
shade
of
the
trees
and
set
me
down
upon
the
felled
tree
where
i
had
been
sitting
before
i
told
him
all
quickly
briefly
all
that
had
happened
since
i
had
written
to
him
i
saw
the
tears
start
to
his
eyes
thank
god
i
am
here
he
said
i
lost
no
time
after
your
letter
reached
me
i
will
save
monsieur
le
curé
i
will
save
them
both
if
i
can
foi
he
is
a
good
man
this
curé
and
we
must
not
let
him
perish
he
has
no
authority
over
me
and
i
will
go
this
moment
and
force
my
way
in
if
the
door
is
fastened
adieu
my
dear
little
he
was
gone
before
i
could
speak
a
word
striding
with
quick
energetic
tread
across
the
court
the
closed
door
under
the
eaves
opened
readily
in
an
instant
the
white
head
of
monsieur
laurentie
passed
the
casement
and
i
could
hear
the
hum
of
an
earnest
altercation
though
i
could
not
catch
a
syllable
of
it
but
presently
tardif
appeared
again
in
the
doorway
waving
his
cap
in
token
of
having
gained
his
point
i
went
back
to
the
village
at
once
to
carry
the
good
news
for
it
was
the
loneliness
of
the
curé
that
had
weighed
so
heavily
on
every
heart
though
none
among
them
dare
brave
his
displeasure
by
setting
aside
his
command
the
quarantine
was
observed
as
rigidly
as
ever
but
fresh
hope
and
confidence
beamed
upon
every
face
and
i
felt
that
they
no
longer
avoided
me
as
they
had
begun
to
do
before
tardif
arrival
now
monsieur
laurentie
could
leave
his
patient
and
sit
under
the
sheltering
eaves
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
or
evening
while
his
people
could
satisfy
themselves
from
a
distance
that
he
was
still
in
health
the
physician
whom
jean
fetched
from
noireau
spoke
vaguely
of
case
it
was
very
malignant
he
said
full
of
danger
and
apparently
his
whole
constitution
had
been
weakened
by
some
protracted
and
grave
malady
we
must
hope
he
added
whether
it
was
in
hope
or
fear
i
awaited
the
issue
i
scarcely
know
i
dared
not
glance
beyond
the
passing
hour
dared
not
conjecture
what
the
end
would
be
the
past
was
dead
the
future
yet
unborn
for
the
moment
my
whole
being
was
concentrated
upon
the
conflict
between
life
and
death
which
was
witnessed
only
by
the
curé
and
tardif
chapter
the
the
last
death
it
seemed
to
me
almost
as
if
time
had
been
standing
still
since
that
first
morning
when
monsieur
laurentie
had
left
my
side
and
passed
out
of
my
sight
to
seek
for
my
husband
in
the
dwelling
yet
it
was
the
tenth
day
after
that
when
as
i
took
up
my
weary
watch
soon
after
daybreak
i
saw
him
crossing
the
court
again
and
coming
toward
me
what
had
he
to
say
what
could
impel
him
to
break
through
the
strict
rule
which
had
interdicted
all
dangerous
contact
with
himself
his
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
were
heavy
as
if
with
want
of
rest
but
they
looked
into
mine
as
if
they
could
read
my
inmost
soul
my
daughter
he
said
i
bade
you
leave
even
your
duty
in
my
keeping
now
i
summon
you
to
fulfil
it
your
duty
lies
yonder
by
your
side
in
his
agony
of
death
i
will
go
i
whispered
my
lips
scarcely
moving
to
pronounce
the
words
so
stiff
and
cold
they
felt
stay
one
moment
he
said
pityingly
you
have
been
taught
to
judge
of
your
duty
for
yourself
not
to
leave
it
to
a
priest
i
ought
to
let
you
judge
now
your
husband
is
dying
but
he
is
conscious
and
is
asking
to
see
you
he
does
not
believe
us
that
death
is
near
he
says
none
but
you
will
tell
him
the
truth
you
can
not
go
to
him
without
running
a
great
risk
your
danger
will
be
greater
than
ours
who
have
been
with
him
all
the
time
you
see
madame
he
does
not
understand
me
and
he
refuses
to
believe
in
tardif
yet
you
can
not
save
him
you
can
only
receive
his
last
adieu
think
well
my
child
your
life
may
be
the
forfeit
i
must
go
i
answered
more
firmly
i
will
go
he
is
my
husband
good
he
said
you
have
chosen
the
better
part
come
then
the
good
god
will
protect
you
he
drew
my
hand
through
his
arm
and
led
me
to
the
low
doorway
the
inner
room
was
very
dark
with
the
overhanging
eaves
and
my
eyes
dilated
by
the
strong
sunlight
could
discern
but
little
in
the
gloom
tardif
was
kneeling
beside
a
low
bed
bathing
my
husband
forehead
he
made
way
for
me
and
i
felt
him
touch
my
hand
with
his
lips
as
i
took
his
place
but
no
one
spoke
richard
face
sunken
haggard
dying
with
filmy
eyes
dawned
gradually
out
of
the
dim
twilight
line
after
line
until
it
lay
sharp
and
distinct
under
my
gaze
i
could
not
turn
away
from
it
for
an
instant
even
to
glance
at
tardif
or
monsieur
laurentie
the
poor
miserable
face
the
restless
dreary
dying
eyes
where
is
olivia
he
muttered
in
a
hoarse
and
labored
voice
i
am
here
richard
i
answered
falling
on
my
knees
where
tardif
had
been
kneeling
and
putting
my
hand
on
his
look
at
me
i
am
olivia
you
are
mine
you
know
he
said
his
fingers
closing
round
my
wrist
with
a
grasp
as
weak
as
a
very
young
she
is
my
wife
monsieur
le
curé
yes
i
sobbed
i
am
your
wife
richard
do
they
hear
it
he
asked
in
a
whisper
we
hear
it
answered
tardif
a
strange
spasmodic
smile
flitted
across
his
ghastly
face
a
look
of
triumph
and
success
his
fingers
tightened
over
my
hand
and
i
left
it
passively
in
their
clasp
mine
he
murmured
olivia
he
said
after
a
long
pause
and
in
a
stronger
voice
you
always
spoke
the
truth
to
me
this
priest
and
his
follower
have
been
trying
to
frighten
me
into
repentance
as
if
i
were
an
old
woman
they
say
i
am
near
dying
tell
me
is
it
true
the
last
words
he
had
spoken
painfully
dragging
them
one
after
another
as
if
the
very
utterance
of
them
was
hateful
to
him
he
looked
at
me
with
his
cold
glittering
eyes
which
seemed
almost
mocking
at
me
even
then
richard
i
said
it
is
true
good
god
he
cried
his
lips
closed
after
that
cry
and
seemed
as
if
they
would
never
open
again
he
shut
his
eyes
weariedly
feebly
and
fitfully
came
his
gasps
for
breath
and
he
moaned
at
times
but
still
his
fingers
held
me
fast
though
the
slightest
effort
of
mine
would
have
set
me
free
i
left
my
hand
in
his
cold
grasp
and
spoke
to
him
whenever
he
moaned
martin
he
breathed
between
his
set
teeth
though
so
low
that
only
my
ear
could
catch
the
words
martin
could
have
saved
me
there
was
another
long
silence
i
could
hear
the
chirping
of
the
sparrows
in
the
thatched
roof
but
no
other
sound
broke
the
deep
stillness
monsieur
laurentie
and
tardif
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
looking
down
upon
us
both
but
i
only
saw
their
shadows
falling
across
us
my
eyes
were
fastened
upon
the
face
i
should
soon
see
no
more
the
little
light
there
was
seemed
to
be
fading
away
from
it
leaving
it
all
dark
and
blank
eyelids
closed
lips
almost
breathless
an
unutterable
emptiness
and
confusion
creeping
over
every
feature
olivia
he
cried
once
again
in
a
tone
of
mingled
anger
and
entreaty
i
am
here
i
answered
laying
my
other
hand
upon
his
which
was
at
last
relaxing
its
hold
and
falling
away
helplessly
but
where
was
he
where
was
the
voice
which
half
a
minute
ago
called
olivia
where
was
the
life
gone
that
had
grasped
my
hand
he
had
not
heard
my
answer
or
felt
my
touch
upon
his
cold
fingers
tardif
lifted
me
gently
from
my
place
beside
him
and
carried
me
away
into
the
open
air
under
the
overshadowing
eaves
chapter
the
free
the
rest
of
that
day
passed
by
like
a
dream
jean
had
come
down
with
the
daily
supply
of
food
and
i
heard
monsieur
laurentie
call
to
him
to
accompany
me
back
to
the
presbytery
and
to
warn
every
one
to
keep
away
from
me
until
i
could
take
every
precaution
against
spreading
infection
he
gave
me
minute
directions
what
to
do
and
i
obeyed
them
automatically
and
mechanically
i
spent
the
whole
day
in
my
room
alone
at
night
after
all
the
village
was
silent
with
the
moon
shining
brilliantly
down
upon
the
deserted
streets
the
sound
of
stealthy
footsteps
came
to
me
through
my
window
i
pulled
the
casement
open
and
looked
out
there
marched
four
men
with
measured
steps
bearing
a
coffin
on
their
shoulders
while
monsieur
laurentie
followed
them
bareheaded
it
was
my
husband
funeral
and
i
sank
upon
my
knees
and
remained
kneeling
till
i
heard
them
return
from
the
little
cemetery
up
the
valley
where
so
many
of
the
curé
flock
had
been
buried
i
prayed
with
all
my
heart
that
no
other
life
would
be
forfeited
to
this
pestilence
which
had
seemed
to
have
passed
away
from
us
but
i
was
worn
out
myself
with
anxiety
and
watching
for
three
or
four
days
i
was
ill
with
a
low
nervous
fever
altogether
unlike
the
terrible
typhoid
yet
such
as
to
keep
me
to
my
room
minima
and
mademoiselle
thérèse
were
my
only
companions
mademoiselle
after
talking
that
one
night
as
much
as
she
generally
talked
in
twelve
months
had
relapsed
into
deeper
taciturnity
than
before
but
her
muteness
tranquillized
me
minima
simple
talk
brought
me
back
to
the
level
of
common
life
my
own
nervous
weeping
which
i
could
not
control
served
to
soothe
me
my
casement
almost
covered
by
broad
clustering
preserved
a
cool
dim
obscurity
in
my
room
the
village
children
seemed
all
at
once
to
have
forgotten
how
to
scream
and
shout
and
no
sound
from
the
street
disturbed
me
even
the
morning
and
evening
bell
rang
with
a
deep
muffled
tone
which
scarcely
stirred
the
silence
i
heard
afterward
that
jean
had
swathed
the
bell
in
a
piece
of
sackcloth
and
that
the
children
had
been
sent
off
early
every
morning
into
the
woods
but
i
could
not
remain
long
in
that
idle
seclusion
i
felt
all
my
strength
returning
both
of
body
and
mind
i
began
to
smile
at
minima
and
to
answer
her
childish
prattle
with
none
of
the
feeling
of
utter
weariness
which
had
at
first
prostrated
me
are
we
going
to
stay
here
forever
and
ever
she
asked
me
one
day
when
i
felt
that
the
solitary
peace
of
my
own
chamber
was
growing
too
monotonous
for
me
should
you
like
to
stay
minima
i
inquired
in
reply
it
was
a
question
i
must
face
that
of
what
i
was
going
to
do
in
the
future
i
do
know
altogether
she
said
reflectively
the
boys
here
are
not
so
nice
as
they
used
to
be
at
home
pierre
says
i
a
little
pagan
and
that
not
nice
aunt
nelly
he
says
i
must
be
baptized
by
monsieur
laurentie
and
be
prepared
for
my
first
communion
before
i
can
be
as
good
as
he
is
the
boys
at
home
used
to
think
me
quite
as
good
as
them
and
better
i
asked
monsieur
laurentie
if
i
ought
to
be
baptized
over
again
and
he
only
smiled
and
said
i
must
be
as
good
a
little
girl
as
i
could
be
and
it
did
not
much
matter
but
pierre
and
all
the
rest
think
i
not
as
good
as
them
and
i
do
like
it
i
could
not
help
laughing
like
monsieur
laurentie
at
distress
yet
it
was
not
without
foundation
here
we
were
heretics
amid
the
orthodox
and
i
felt
it
myself
though
monsieur
le
curé
never
alluded
to
it
in
the
most
distant
manner
there
was
a
difference
between
us
and
the
simple
in
which
would
always
mark
us
as
strangers
in
blood
and
creed
i
think
continued
minima
with
a
shrewd
expression
on
her
face
which
was
beginning
to
fill
up
and
grow
round
in
its
outlines
i
think
when
you
are
quite
well
again
we
better
be
going
on
somewhere
to
try
our
fortunes
it
never
does
you
know
to
stop
too
long
in
the
same
place
i
quite
sure
we
shall
never
meet
the
prince
here
and
i
think
we
shall
find
any
treasure
besides
if
we
began
to
dig
they
all
know
and
want
to
go
shares
i
should
mind
going
shares
with
monsieur
laurentie
but
i
would
not
go
shares
with
pierre
of
course
when
made
our
fortunes
we
come
back
and
we
build
monsieur
laurentie
a
palace
of
marble
and
put
turkey
carpets
on
all
the
floors
and
have
fountains
and
statues
and
all
sorts
of
things
and
give
him
a
cook
to
cook
splendid
dinners
but
we
would
stay
here
always
if
we
were
very
very
rich
would
you
aunt
nelly
has
anybody
told
you
that
i
am
rich
i
asked
with
a
passing
feeling
of
vexation
oh
no
she
said
laughing
heartily
i
should
know
better
than
that
you
very
poor
my
darling
auntie
but
i
love
you
all
the
same
we
shall
be
rich
some
day
of
course
it
all
coming
right
her
hand
was
stroking
my
face
and
i
drew
it
to
my
lips
and
kissed
it
tenderly
i
had
scarcely
realized
before
what
a
change
had
come
over
my
circumstances
but
i
am
not
poor
any
longer
my
little
girl
i
said
i
am
rich
very
rich
she
asked
eagerly
very
rich
i
repeated
and
we
shall
never
have
to
go
walking
walking
till
our
feet
are
sore
and
tired
and
we
shall
not
be
hungry
and
be
afraid
of
spending
our
money
and
we
shall
buy
new
clothes
as
soon
as
the
old
ones
are
worn
out
o
aunt
nelly
is
it
true
is
it
quite
true
it
is
quite
true
my
poor
minima
i
answered
she
looked
at
me
wistfully
with
the
color
coming
and
going
on
her
face
then
she
climbed
up
and
lay
down
beside
me
with
her
arm
over
me
and
her
face
close
to
mine
o
aunt
nelly
she
cried
if
this
had
only
come
while
my
father
was
alive
minima
i
said
after
her
sobs
and
tears
were
ended
you
will
always
be
my
little
girl
you
shall
come
and
live
with
me
wherever
i
live
of
course
she
answered
with
the
simple
trustfulness
of
a
child
we
are
going
to
live
together
till
we
die
you
wo
send
me
to
school
will
you
you
know
what
school
is
like
now
and
you
would
like
me
to
send
you
to
school
would
you
if
i
were
a
rich
lady
and
you
were
a
little
girl
like
me
i
know
what
i
should
do
what
would
you
do
i
inquired
laughing
i
should
give
you
lots
of
dolls
and
things
she
said
quite
seriously
her
brows
puckered
with
anxiety
and
i
should
let
you
have
every
day
and
i
should
make
every
thing
as
nice
as
possible
of
course
i
should
make
you
learn
lessons
whether
you
liked
it
or
not
but
i
should
teach
you
myself
and
then
i
should
know
nobody
was
unkind
to
you
that
what
i
should
do
aunt
nelly
and
that
what
i
shall
do
minima
i
repeated
we
had
many
things
to
settle
that
morning
making
our
preliminary
arrangements
for
the
spending
of
my
fortune
upon
many
dolls
and
much
jam
but
the
conviction
was
forced
upon
me
that
i
must
be
setting
about
more
important
plans
tardif
was
still
staying
in
delaying
his
departure
till
i
was
well
enough
to
see
him
i
resolved
to
get
up
that
evening
as
soon
as
the
heat
of
the
day
was
past
and
have
a
conversation
with
him
and
monsieur
laurentie
chapter
the
a
year
news
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
while
the
chanting
of
vespers
in
the
church
close
by
was
faintly
audible
i
went
downstairs
into
the
all
the
household
were
gone
to
the
service
but
i
saw
tardif
sitting
outside
in
my
own
favorite
seat
under
the
i
sent
minima
to
call
him
to
me
bidding
her
stay
herself
and
he
came
in
hurriedly
with
a
glad
light
in
his
deep
honest
eyes
thank
god
thank
god
he
said
yes
i
answered
i
am
well
again
now
i
have
not
been
really
ill
i
know
but
i
felt
weary
and
sick
at
heart
my
good
tardif
how
much
i
owe
you
you
owe
me
nothing
he
said
dropping
my
hand
and
carrying
the
curé
chair
to
the
open
window
for
me
to
sit
in
it
and
have
all
the
freshness
there
was
in
the
air
dear
he
added
if
you
only
think
of
me
as
your
friend
that
is
enough
you
are
my
truest
friend
i
replied
no
no
you
have
another
as
true
he
answered
and
you
have
this
good
monsieur
le
curé
into
the
bargain
if
the
curés
were
all
like
him
i
should
be
thinking
of
becoming
a
good
catholic
myself
and
you
know
how
far
i
am
from
being
that
no
one
can
say
a
word
too
much
in
his
praise
i
said
except
continued
tardif
that
he
desires
to
keep
our
little
in
his
village
must
she
leave
me
he
says
do
i
say
a
word
contrary
to
her
religion
or
that
of
the
let
them
stay
in
but
martin
says
she
must
not
remain
here
the
air
is
not
good
for
her
the
village
is
not
drained
and
it
is
unhealthy
there
will
always
be
fever
here
martin
was
almost
angry
with
monsieur
le
curé
dr
martin
i
said
in
a
tone
of
wonder
and
inquiry
martin
i
sent
a
message
to
him
by
telegraph
it
was
altered
somehow
in
the
offices
and
he
did
not
know
who
was
dead
he
started
off
at
once
travelled
without
stopping
and
reached
this
place
two
nights
ago
is
he
here
now
i
asked
while
a
troubled
feeling
stirred
the
tranquillity
which
had
but
just
returned
to
me
i
shrank
from
seeing
him
just
then
no
he
went
away
this
morning
as
soon
as
he
was
sure
you
would
recover
without
his
help
he
said
that
to
see
him
might
do
you
more
harm
trouble
you
more
than
he
could
do
you
good
by
his
medicines
he
and
monsieur
le
curé
parted
good
friends
though
they
were
not
of
the
same
mind
about
you
her
stay
here
says
monsieur
le
curé
must
return
to
england
says
martin
must
be
free
to
choose
for
herself
i
said
they
both
smiled
and
said
yes
i
was
right
you
must
be
free
why
did
no
one
tell
me
he
was
here
why
did
minima
keep
it
a
secret
i
asked
he
forbade
us
to
tell
you
he
did
not
wish
to
disquiet
you
he
said
to
me
she
ever
wishes
to
see
me
i
would
come
gladly
from
london
to
only
to
hear
her
say
dr
martin
i
will
not
see
her
now
unless
she
is
seriously
i
felt
that
he
was
right
martin
is
always
right
i
did
not
speak
when
tardif
paused
as
if
to
hear
what
i
had
to
say
i
heard
him
sigh
as
softly
as
a
woman
sighs
if
you
could
only
come
back
to
my
poor
little
house
he
said
but
that
is
impossible
my
poor
mother
died
in
the
spring
and
i
am
living
alone
it
is
desolate
but
i
am
not
unhappy
i
have
my
boat
and
the
sea
where
i
am
never
solitary
but
why
should
i
talk
of
myself
we
were
speaking
of
what
you
are
to
do
i
do
know
what
to
do
i
said
despondently
you
see
tardif
i
have
not
a
single
friend
i
could
go
to
in
england
i
shall
have
to
stay
here
in
no
he
answered
martin
has
some
plan
for
you
i
know
though
he
did
not
tell
me
what
it
is
he
said
you
would
have
a
home
offered
to
you
such
as
you
would
accept
gladly
i
think
it
is
in
guernsey
with
his
mother
perhaps
i
suggested
his
mother
he
repeated
alas
no
his
mother
is
dead
she
died
only
a
few
weeks
after
you
left
sark
i
felt
as
if
i
had
lost
an
old
friend
whom
i
had
known
for
a
long
time
though
i
had
only
seen
her
once
in
my
greatest
difficulty
i
had
thought
of
making
my
way
to
her
and
telling
her
all
my
history
i
did
not
know
what
other
home
could
open
for
me
if
she
were
dead
dobrée
married
a
second
wife
only
three
months
after
pursued
tardif
and
martin
left
guernsey
altogether
and
went
to
london
to
be
a
partner
with
his
friend
dr
senior
john
senior
i
said
yes
he
answered
why
i
know
him
i
exclaimed
i
recollect
his
face
well
he
is
handsomer
than
martin
but
whom
did
dobrée
marry
i
do
not
know
whether
he
is
handsomer
than
martin
said
tardif
in
a
grieved
tone
who
did
dobrée
marry
oh
a
foreigner
no
guernsey
lady
would
have
married
him
so
soon
after
dobrée
death
she
was
a
great
friend
of
miss
julia
dobrée
her
name
was
daltrey
kate
daltrey
i
ejaculated
my
brain
seemed
to
whirl
with
the
recollections
the
associations
the
rapid
mingling
and
odd
readjustment
of
ideas
forced
upon
me
by
tardif
words
what
would
have
become
of
me
if
i
had
found
my
way
to
guernsey
seeking
dobrée
and
discovered
in
her
kate
daltrey
i
had
not
time
to
realize
this
before
tardif
went
on
in
his
narration
martin
was
he
said
we
had
lost
you
and
his
mother
was
dead
he
had
no
one
to
turn
to
for
comfort
his
cousin
julia
who
was
to
have
been
his
wife
was
married
to
captain
carey
three
weeks
ago
you
recollect
captain
carey
here
was
more
news
and
a
fresh
rearranging
of
the
persons
who
peopled
my
world
kate
daltrey
become
dobrée
second
wife
julia
dobrée
married
to
captain
carey
and
martin
living
in
london
the
partner
of
senior
how
could
i
put
them
all
into
their
places
in
a
moment
tardif
too
was
dwelling
alone
now
solitarily
in
a
very
solitary
place
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
i
said
in
a
low
tone
why
he
asked
because
you
have
lost
your
mother
i
answered
yes
he
said
simply
she
was
a
great
loss
to
me
though
she
was
always
fretting
about
my
inheriting
the
land
that
is
the
law
of
the
island
and
no
one
can
set
it
aside
the
eldest
son
inherits
the
land
and
i
was
not
her
own
son
though
i
did
my
best
to
be
like
a
real
son
to
her
she
died
happier
in
thinking
that
her
son
or
grandson
would
follow
me
when
i
am
gone
and
i
was
glad
she
had
that
to
comfort
her
poor
woman
but
you
may
marry
again
some
day
my
good
tardif
i
said
how
i
wish
you
would
no
no
he
answered
with
a
strange
quivering
tone
in
his
voice
my
mother
knew
why
before
she
died
and
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
her
do
not
think
i
am
not
happy
alone
there
are
some
memories
that
are
better
company
than
most
folks
yes
there
are
some
things
i
can
think
of
that
are
more
and
better
than
any
wife
could
be
to
me
why
we
were
both
silent
after
that
i
scarcely
knew
both
of
us
had
many
things
to
think
about
no
doubt
and
the
ideas
were
tumbling
over
one
another
in
my
poor
brain
till
i
wished
i
could
cease
to
think
for
a
few
hours
vespers
ended
and
the
villagers
began
to
disperse
stealthily
not
a
wooden
clattered
on
the
stones
mademoiselle
and
monsieur
laurentie
came
in
with
a
tread
as
soft
as
if
they
were
afraid
of
waking
a
child
out
of
a
light
slumber
mademoiselle
i
cried
monsieur
behold
me
i
am
here
my
voice
and
my
greeting
seemed
to
transport
them
with
delight
mademoiselle
embraced
me
and
kissed
me
on
both
cheeks
monsieur
le
curé
blessed
me
in
a
tremulously
joyous
accent
and
insisted
upon
my
keeping
his
we
sat
down
to
supper
together
by
the
light
of
a
brilliant
little
lamp
and
pierre
who
was
passing
the
uncurtained
window
saw
me
there
and
carried
the
news
into
the
village
the
next
day
tardif
bade
me
farewell
and
monsieur
laurentie
drove
him
to
granville
on
his
way
home
to
sark
chapter
the
farewell
to
the
unbroken
monotony
of
closed
over
me
again
the
tolling
of
the
morning
bell
the
hum
of
matins
the
frugal
breakfast
in
the
sunlit
the
long
hot
day
vespers
again
then
an
hour
chat
by
twilight
with
the
drowsy
curé
and
his
sister
whose
words
were
so
rare
before
six
such
days
had
passed
i
felt
as
if
they
were
to
last
my
lifetime
then
the
fretting
of
my
uneasy
woman
heart
began
there
was
no
sign
that
i
had
any
friends
in
england
what
ought
i
to
do
how
must
i
set
about
the
intricate
business
of
my
affairs
must
i
write
to
my
trustees
in
melbourne
giving
them
the
information
of
my
death
and
wait
till
i
could
receive
from
them
instructions
and
credentials
to
prove
my
identity
without
which
it
was
useless
if
it
were
practicable
to
return
to
london
was
there
ever
any
one
as
friendless
as
i
was
monsieur
laurentie
could
give
me
no
counsel
except
to
keep
myself
tranquil
but
how
difficult
it
was
to
keep
tranquil
amid
such
profound
repose
i
had
often
found
it
easier
to
be
calm
amid
many
provocations
and
numerous
difficulties
a
week
has
glided
by
a
full
week
the
has
brought
me
no
letter
i
am
seated
at
the
window
of
the
gasping
in
these
simmering
for
a
breath
of
fresh
air
such
a
cool
balmy
breeze
as
blows
over
the
summer
sea
to
the
cliffs
of
sark
monsieur
laurentie
under
the
shelter
of
a
huge
red
umbrella
is
choosing
the
ripest
cluster
of
grapes
for
our
supper
this
evening
all
the
street
is
as
still
as
at
midnight
suddenly
there
breaks
upon
us
the
harsh
metallic
clang
of
upon
the
stony
roadway
the
cracking
of
a
postilion
whip
the
clatter
of
an
approaching
carriage
it
proves
to
be
a
carriage
with
a
pair
of
horses
pierre
who
has
been
basking
idly
under
the
window
jumps
to
his
feet
shouting
it
is
monsieur
the
bishop
minima
claps
her
hands
and
cries
the
prince
aunt
nelly
the
prince
monsieur
laurentie
walks
slowly
down
to
the
gate
his
cotton
umbrella
spread
over
him
like
a
giant
fungus
it
is
certainly
not
the
prince
for
an
elderly
man
older
than
monsieur
laurentie
but
with
a
more
imposing
and
stately
presence
steps
out
of
the
carriage
and
they
salute
one
another
with
great
ceremony
if
that
be
monsieur
the
bishop
he
has
very
much
the
air
of
an
englishman
in
a
few
minutes
my
doubt
as
to
the
bishop
nationality
was
solved
the
two
men
the
one
in
a
glossy
and
handsome
suit
of
black
the
other
in
his
brown
and
cassock
came
up
the
path
together
under
the
red
umbrella
they
entered
the
house
and
came
directly
to
the
i
was
making
my
escape
by
another
door
not
being
sure
how
i
ought
to
encounter
a
bishop
when
monsieur
laurentie
called
to
me
behold
a
friend
for
you
madame
he
said
a
friend
from
monsieur
this
is
my
beloved
english
child
i
turned
back
and
met
the
eyes
of
both
fixed
upon
me
with
that
peculiar
expression
with
which
so
many
old
men
look
upon
women
as
young
as
i
a
smile
came
across
my
face
and
i
held
out
my
hand
involuntarily
to
the
stranger
you
do
not
know
who
i
am
my
dear
he
said
the
english
voice
and
words
went
straight
to
my
heart
how
many
months
it
was
since
i
had
heard
my
own
language
spoken
thus
tardif
had
been
too
glad
to
speak
in
his
own
now
i
understood
it
so
well
and
minima
prattle
had
not
sounded
to
me
like
those
few
syllables
in
the
deep
cultivated
voice
which
uttered
them
no
i
answered
but
you
are
come
to
me
from
martin
dobrée
very
true
he
said
i
am
his
friend
father
john
father
martin
has
sent
me
to
you
he
wished
miss
johanna
carey
to
accompany
me
but
we
were
afraid
of
the
fever
for
her
i
am
an
old
physician
and
feel
at
home
with
disease
and
contagion
but
we
can
not
allow
you
to
remain
in
this
unhealthy
village
that
is
out
of
the
question
i
am
come
to
carry
you
away
in
spite
of
this
old
curé
monsieur
laurentie
was
listening
eagerly
and
watching
lips
as
if
he
could
catch
the
meaning
of
his
words
by
sight
if
not
by
hearing
but
where
am
i
to
go
i
asked
i
have
no
money
and
can
not
get
any
until
i
have
written
to
melbourne
and
have
an
answer
i
have
no
means
of
proving
who
i
am
leave
all
that
to
us
my
dear
girl
answered
senior
cordially
i
have
already
spoken
of
your
affairs
to
an
old
friend
of
mine
who
is
an
excellent
lawyer
i
am
come
to
offer
myself
to
you
in
place
of
your
guardians
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
you
will
do
me
a
very
great
favor
by
frankly
accepting
a
home
in
my
house
for
the
present
i
have
neither
wife
nor
daughter
but
miss
carey
is
already
there
preparing
rooms
for
you
and
your
little
charge
we
have
made
inquiries
about
the
little
girl
and
find
she
has
no
friends
living
i
will
take
care
of
her
future
do
you
think
you
could
trust
yourself
and
her
to
me
oh
yes
i
replied
but
i
moved
a
little
nearer
to
monsieur
laurentie
and
put
my
hand
through
his
arm
he
folded
his
own
thin
brown
hand
over
it
caressingly
and
looked
down
at
me
with
something
like
tears
glistening
in
his
eyes
is
it
all
settled
he
asked
is
monsieur
come
to
rob
me
of
my
english
daughter
she
will
go
away
now
to
her
own
island
and
forget
and
her
poor
old
french
father
never
never
i
answered
vehemently
i
shall
not
forget
you
as
long
as
i
live
besides
i
mean
to
come
back
very
often
every
year
if
i
can
i
almost
wish
i
could
stay
here
altogether
but
you
know
that
is
impossible
monsieur
is
it
not
quite
impossible
quite
impossible
he
repeated
somewhat
sadly
madame
is
too
rich
now
she
will
have
many
good
friends
not
one
better
than
you
i
said
not
one
more
dear
than
you
yes
i
am
rich
and
i
have
been
planning
something
to
do
for
would
you
like
the
church
enlarged
and
beautified
monsieur
le
curé
it
is
large
enough
and
fine
enough
already
he
answered
shall
i
put
some
painted
windows
and
marble
images
into
it
i
asked
no
no
madame
he
replied
let
it
remain
as
it
is
during
my
short
lifetime
i
thought
so
i
said
but
i
believe
i
have
discovered
what
monsieur
le
curé
would
approve
it
is
truly
english
there
is
no
sentiment
no
romance
about
it
can
not
you
guess
what
it
is
my
wise
and
learned
monsieur
no
no
madame
he
answered
smiling
in
spite
of
his
sadness
listen
dear
monsieur
i
continued
if
this
village
is
unhealthy
for
me
it
is
unhealthy
for
you
and
your
people
martin
told
tardif
there
would
always
be
fever
here
as
long
as
there
are
no
drains
and
no
pure
water
very
well
now
i
am
rich
i
shall
have
it
drained
precisely
like
the
best
english
town
and
there
shall
be
a
fountain
in
the
middle
of
the
village
where
all
the
people
can
go
to
draw
good
water
i
shall
come
back
next
year
to
see
how
it
has
been
done
monsieur
there
is
my
secret
plan
for
nothing
could
have
been
more
effectual
for
turning
away
monsieur
laurentie
thoughts
from
the
mournful
topic
of
our
near
separation
after
vespers
and
before
supper
he
senior
and
i
made
the
tour
of
investigating
the
close
dark
cottages
and
discussing
plans
for
rendering
them
more
wholesome
the
next
day
and
the
day
following
the
same
subject
continued
to
occupy
him
and
senior
and
thus
the
pain
of
our
departure
was
counterbalanced
by
his
pleasure
in
anticipating
the
advantages
to
be
obtained
by
a
thorough
drainage
of
his
village
and
more
ventilation
and
light
in
the
dwellings
the
evening
before
we
were
to
set
out
on
our
return
to
england
while
the
whole
population
including
senior
were
assisting
at
vespers
i
turned
my
feet
toward
the
little
cemetery
on
the
which
i
had
never
yet
the
sun
had
sunk
below
the
tops
of
the
which
grew
along
the
brow
of
the
hill
in
grotesque
and
fantastic
shapes
but
a
few
stray
beams
glimmered
through
the
branches
and
fell
here
and
there
in
spots
of
dancing
light
the
small
square
enclosure
was
crowded
with
little
hillocks
at
the
head
of
which
stood
simple
crosses
of
wood
crosses
so
light
and
little
as
to
seem
significant
emblems
of
the
difference
between
our
sorrows
and
those
borne
for
our
sakes
upon
calvary
wreaths
of
immortelles
hung
upon
most
of
them
below
me
lay
the
valley
and
the
homes
where
the
dead
at
my
feet
had
lived
the
sunshine
lingered
yet
about
the
spire
with
its
cross
which
towered
above
the
belfry
but
all
else
was
in
shadow
which
was
slowly
deepening
into
night
in
the
west
the
sky
was
flushing
and
throbbing
with
transparent
tints
of
amber
and
purple
and
green
with
flecks
of
cloud
floating
across
it
of
a
pale
gold
eastward
it
was
still
blue
but
fading
into
a
faint
gray
the
dusky
green
of
the
cypresses
looked
black
as
i
turned
my
eyes
toward
them
i
strolled
to
and
fro
among
the
grassy
mounds
not
consciously
seeking
one
of
them
though
very
deep
down
in
my
inmost
spirit
there
must
have
been
an
impulse
which
unwittingly
directed
me
i
did
not
stay
my
feet
or
turn
away
from
the
village
until
i
came
upon
a
grave
the
latest
made
among
them
it
was
solitary
unmarked
with
no
cross
to
throw
its
shadow
along
it
as
the
sun
was
setting
i
knew
then
that
i
had
come
to
seek
it
to
bid
farewell
to
it
to
leave
it
behind
me
for
evermore
the
next
morning
monsieur
laurentie
accompanied
us
on
our
journey
as
far
as
the
cross
at
the
entrance
to
the
valley
he
parted
with
us
there
and
when
i
stood
up
in
the
carriage
to
look
back
once
more
at
him
i
saw
his
figure
kneeling
on
the
white
steps
of
the
calvary
and
the
sun
shining
upon
his
silvery
head
chapter
the
too
highly
civilized
for
the
third
time
i
landed
in
england
when
i
set
foot
upon
its
shores
first
i
was
worse
than
friendless
with
foes
of
my
own
household
surrounding
me
the
second
time
i
was
utterly
alone
in
daily
terror
in
poverty
with
a
dreary
future
stretching
before
me
now
every
want
of
mine
was
anticipated
every
step
directed
as
if
i
were
a
child
again
and
my
father
himself
was
caring
for
me
how
many
friends
good
and
tried
and
true
could
i
count
all
the
rough
paths
were
made
smooth
for
me
it
was
dusk
before
we
reached
london
but
before
the
train
stopped
at
the
platform
a
man
hand
was
laid
upon
the
and
a
handsome
face
was
smiling
over
it
upon
us
i
scarcely
dared
look
who
it
was
but
the
voice
that
reached
my
ears
was
not
martin
dobrée
i
am
here
in
martin
place
said
john
senior
as
soon
as
he
could
make
himself
heard
he
has
been
hindered
by
a
wretch
of
a
welcome
home
miss
martineau
she
is
not
miss
martineau
john
remarked
senior
there
was
a
tinge
of
stateliness
about
him
bordering
upon
formality
which
had
kept
me
a
little
in
awe
of
him
all
the
journey
through
his
son
laughed
with
a
pleasant
audacity
welcome
home
olivia
then
he
said
clasping
my
hand
warmly
martin
and
i
never
call
you
by
any
other
name
a
carriage
was
waiting
for
us
and
john
took
minima
beside
him
chattering
with
her
as
the
child
loved
to
chatter
as
for
me
i
felt
a
little
anxious
and
uneasy
once
more
i
was
about
to
enter
upon
an
entirely
new
life
upon
the
untried
ways
of
a
wealthy
conventional
punctilious
english
household
hitherto
my
mode
of
life
had
been
almost
as
wandering
and
free
as
that
of
a
gypsy
even
at
home
during
my
pleasant
childhood
our
customs
had
been
those
of
an
australian
exempt
from
all
the
usages
of
any
thing
like
fashion
john
kid
gloves
which
fitted
his
hand
to
perfection
made
me
uncomfortable
i
felt
still
more
abashed
and
oppressed
when
we
reached
house
and
a
footman
ran
down
to
the
carriage
to
open
the
door
and
to
carry
in
my
poor
little
portmanteau
it
looked
miserably
poor
and
out
of
place
in
the
large
hall
minima
kept
close
beside
me
silent
but
gazing
upon
this
new
abode
with
eyes
why
was
not
martin
here
he
had
known
me
in
sark
in
tardif
cottage
and
he
would
understand
how
strange
and
how
unlike
home
all
this
was
to
me
a
trim
maid
was
summoned
to
show
us
to
our
rooms
and
she
eyed
us
with
silent
criticism
she
conducted
us
to
a
large
and
lofty
apartment
daintily
and
luxuriously
fitted
up
with
a
hundred
about
it
of
which
i
could
not
even
guess
the
use
a
smaller
room
communicated
with
it
which
had
been
evidently
furnished
for
minima
the
child
squeezed
my
hand
tightly
as
we
gazed
into
it
i
felt
as
if
we
were
gypsies
suddenly
caught
and
caged
in
a
splendid
captivity
is
it
awful
asked
minima
in
a
whisper
it
frightens
me
it
almost
frightened
me
too
i
was
disconcerted
also
by
my
own
reflection
in
the
long
mirror
before
me
a
rustic
homely
with
a
brown
face
and
rough
hands
looked
back
at
me
from
the
shining
surface
wearing
a
dress
for
i
had
not
had
time
to
buy
more
than
a
bonnet
and
shawl
as
we
passed
through
falaise
what
would
miss
carey
think
of
me
how
should
i
look
in
john
fastidious
eyes
would
not
martin
be
disappointed
and
shocked
when
he
saw
me
again
i
could
not
make
any
change
in
my
costume
and
the
maid
carried
off
minima
to
do
what
she
could
with
her
there
came
a
gentle
knock
at
my
door
and
miss
carey
entered
here
was
the
fitting
personage
to
dwell
in
a
house
like
this
a
delicate
dress
a
dainty
lace
cap
a
perfect
a
dignified
presence
my
heart
sank
low
but
she
kissed
me
affectionately
and
smiled
as
i
looked
anxiously
into
her
face
my
dear
she
said
i
hope
you
will
like
your
room
john
and
martin
have
ransacked
london
for
pretty
things
for
it
see
there
is
a
painting
of
tardifs
cottage
in
sark
julia
has
painted
it
for
you
and
here
is
a
portrait
of
my
dear
friend
martin
mother
he
hung
it
there
himself
only
this
morning
i
hope
you
will
soon
feel
quite
at
home
with
us
olivia
before
i
could
answer
a
gong
sounded
through
the
house
with
a
sudden
clang
that
startled
me
we
went
down
to
the
where
senior
gave
me
his
arm
and
led
me
ceremoniously
to
dinner
at
this
very
hour
my
dear
monsieur
laurentie
and
mademoiselle
were
taking
their
simple
supper
at
the
little
round
table
white
as
wood
could
be
made
by
scrubbing
but
with
no
cloth
upon
it
my
chair
and
minima
would
be
standing
back
against
the
wall
the
tears
smarted
under
my
eyelids
and
i
answered
at
random
to
the
remarks
made
to
me
how
i
longed
to
be
alone
for
a
little
while
until
i
could
realize
all
the
change
that
had
come
into
my
life
we
had
been
in
the
again
only
a
few
minutes
when
we
heard
the
opened
and
a
voice
speaking
by
common
consent
as
it
were
every
one
fell
into
silence
to
listen
i
looked
up
for
a
moment
and
saw
that
all
three
of
them
had
turned
their
eyes
upon
me
friendly
eyes
they
were
but
their
scrutiny
was
intolerable
senior
began
to
talk
busily
with
miss
carey
hush
cried
minima
who
was
standing
beside
john
hush
i
believe
it
is
yes
i
am
sure
it
is
dr
martin
she
sprang
to
the
door
just
as
it
was
opened
and
flung
her
arms
round
him
in
a
transport
of
delight
i
did
not
dare
to
lift
my
eyes
again
to
see
them
all
smiling
at
me
he
could
not
come
at
once
to
speak
to
me
while
that
child
was
clinging
to
him
and
kissing
him
i
so
glad
she
said
almost
sobbing
come
and
see
my
auntie
who
was
so
ill
when
you
were
in
you
did
not
see
her
you
know
but
she
is
quite
well
now
and
very
very
rich
we
are
never
going
to
be
poor
again
come
she
is
here
auntie
this
is
that
nice
martin
who
made
me
promise
not
to
tell
you
he
was
at
while
you
were
so
she
dragged
him
eagerly
toward
me
and
i
put
my
hand
in
his
but
i
did
not
look
at
him
that
i
did
some
minutes
afterward
when
he
was
talking
to
miss
carey
it
was
many
months
since
i
had
seen
him
last
in
sark
there
was
a
great
change
in
his
face
and
he
looked
several
years
older
it
was
grave
and
almost
mournful
as
if
he
did
not
smile
very
often
and
his
voice
was
lower
in
tone
than
it
had
been
then
john
who
was
standing
beside
him
was
certainly
much
gayer
and
handsomer
than
he
was
he
caught
my
eye
and
came
back
to
me
sitting
near
enough
to
talk
with
me
in
an
undertone
are
you
satisfied
with
the
arrangements
we
have
made
for
you
he
inquired
quite
i
said
not
daring
either
to
thank
him
or
to
tell
him
how
oppressed
i
was
by
my
sudden
change
both
of
us
spoke
as
quietly
and
with
as
much
outward
calm
as
if
we
were
in
the
habit
of
seeing
each
other
every
day
a
chill
came
across
me
at
one
time
he
continued
i
asked
johanna
to
open
her
home
to
you
but
that
was
when
i
thought
you
would
be
safer
and
happier
in
a
quiet
place
like
hers
than
anywhere
else
now
you
are
your
own
mistress
and
can
choose
your
own
residence
but
you
could
not
have
a
better
home
than
this
it
would
not
be
well
for
you
so
young
and
friendless
to
live
in
a
house
of
your
own
no
i
said
somewhat
sadly
senior
is
delighted
to
have
you
here
he
went
on
you
will
see
very
good
society
in
this
house
and
that
is
what
you
should
do
you
ought
to
see
more
and
better
people
than
you
have
yet
known
does
it
seem
strange
to
you
that
we
have
assumed
a
sort
of
authority
over
you
and
your
affairs
you
do
not
yet
know
how
we
have
been
involved
in
them
how
i
asked
looking
up
into
his
face
with
a
growing
curiosity
olivia
he
said
foster
was
my
patient
for
some
months
and
i
knew
all
his
affairs
intimately
he
had
married
that
person
married
her
i
ejaculated
yes
you
want
to
know
how
he
could
do
that
well
he
produced
two
papers
one
a
medical
certificate
of
your
death
the
other
a
letter
purporting
to
be
from
some
clergyman
he
had
too
a
few
lines
in
your
own
handwriting
which
stated
you
had
sent
him
your
ring
the
only
valuable
thing
left
to
you
as
you
had
sufficient
for
your
last
necessities
even
i
believed
for
a
few
hours
that
you
were
dead
but
i
must
tell
you
all
about
it
another
time
did
he
believe
it
i
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
i
do
not
know
he
answered
i
can
not
tell
even
now
whether
he
knew
them
to
be
forgeries
or
not
but
i
have
no
doubt
myself
that
they
were
forged
by
foster
brother
and
his
partner
scott
and
brown
but
for
what
reason
i
asked
again
what
reason
he
repeated
you
were
too
rich
a
prize
for
them
to
allow
foster
to
risk
losing
any
part
of
his
claim
upon
you
if
he
found
you
you
and
all
you
had
were
his
property
on
certain
defined
conditions
you
do
not
understand
our
marriage
laws
it
is
as
well
for
you
not
to
understand
them
foster
gave
up
to
me
all
his
papers
and
the
letters
and
credentials
from
your
trustees
in
melbourne
to
your
bankers
here
there
will
be
very
little
trouble
for
you
now
thank
god
all
your
life
lies
clear
and
fair
before
you
i
had
still
many
questions
to
ask
but
my
lips
trembled
so
much
that
i
could
not
speak
readily
he
was
himself
silent
probably
because
he
also
had
so
much
to
say
all
the
others
were
sitting
a
little
apart
from
us
at
a
where
senior
and
miss
carey
were
playing
while
john
sat
by
holding
minima
in
his
arm
though
she
was
gazing
wistfully
across
to
martin
and
me
you
are
tired
olivia
said
martin
after
a
time
tired
and
sad
your
eyes
are
full
of
tears
i
must
be
your
doctor
again
for
this
evening
and
send
you
to
bed
at
once
it
is
eleven
already
but
these
people
will
sit
up
till
after
midnight
you
need
not
say
to
minima
come
here
she
did
not
wait
for
a
second
word
or
a
louder
summons
but
she
slipped
under
john
arm
and
rushed
across
to
us
being
caught
by
martin
before
she
could
throw
herself
upon
me
he
sat
still
talking
to
her
for
a
few
minutes
and
listening
to
her
account
of
our
journey
and
how
frightened
we
were
at
the
grandeur
about
us
his
face
lit
up
with
a
smile
as
his
eyes
fell
upon
me
as
if
for
the
first
time
he
noticed
how
out
of
keeping
i
was
with
the
place
then
he
led
us
quietly
away
and
to
my
olivia
he
said
sleep
soundly
both
of
you
for
you
are
at
home
i
will
send
one
of
the
maids
up
to
you
no
no
i
cried
hastily
they
despise
us
already
ah
he
said
you
are
the
olivia
i
knew
first
in
sark
in
a
week
time
i
shall
find
you
a
fine
lady
chapter
the
seeing
society
whether
or
no
i
was
transformed
into
a
finer
lady
than
martin
anticipated
i
could
not
tell
but
certainly
after
that
first
evening
he
held
himself
aloof
from
me
i
soon
learned
to
laugh
at
the
dismay
which
had
filled
me
upon
my
entrance
into
my
new
sphere
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
resist
the
cordiality
with
which
i
was
adopted
into
the
household
senior
treated
me
as
his
daughter
john
was
as
much
at
home
with
me
as
if
i
had
been
his
sister
we
often
rode
together
for
i
was
always
fond
of
riding
as
a
child
and
he
was
a
thorough
horseman
he
said
martin
could
ride
better
than
himself
but
martin
never
asked
me
to
go
out
with
him
minima
too
became
perfectly
reconciled
to
her
new
position
though
for
a
time
she
was
anxious
lest
we
were
spending
our
riches
too
lavishly
i
heard
her
one
day
soundly
rating
john
who
seldom
came
to
his
father
house
without
bringing
some
trinket
or
bouquet
or
toy
for
one
or
other
of
us
you
are
wasting
all
your
money
she
said
with
that
anxious
little
pucker
of
her
eyebrows
which
was
gradually
being
smoothed
away
altogether
you
just
like
the
boys
after
the
holidays
they
would
buy
lots
of
things
every
time
the
came
and
she
came
every
day
till
they
spent
all
their
money
you
ca
always
have
cakes
you
know
and
then
you
miss
them
but
i
shall
have
cakes
always
answered
john
nobody
has
them
always
she
said
in
an
authoritative
tone
and
you
wo
like
being
poor
we
were
so
poor
we
dare
buy
as
much
as
we
could
eat
and
our
boots
wore
out
at
the
toes
you
like
to
have
nice
boots
and
gloves
and
things
so
you
must
learn
to
take
care
of
your
money
and
not
waste
it
like
this
i
not
wasting
my
money
little
woman
he
replied
when
i
buy
pretty
things
for
you
and
olivia
why
does
martin
do
it
then
she
asked
he
never
spends
his
money
in
that
sort
of
way
why
does
he
give
auntie
as
many
things
as
you
do
martin
had
been
listening
to
minima
rebukes
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
but
now
it
clouded
a
little
and
i
knew
he
glanced
across
to
me
i
appeared
deeply
absorbed
in
the
book
i
held
in
my
hand
and
he
did
not
see
that
i
was
listening
and
watching
attentively
minima
he
said
in
a
low
tone
as
if
he
did
not
care
that
even
she
should
hear
i
gave
her
all
i
had
worth
giving
when
i
saw
her
first
that
just
how
it
will
be
with
you
john
exclaimed
minima
triumphantly
you
give
us
every
thing
you
have
and
then
you
have
nothing
left
for
yourself
but
still
unless
martin
had
taken
back
what
he
gave
to
me
so
long
ago
his
conduct
was
very
mysterious
to
me
he
did
not
come
to
fulham
half
as
often
as
john
did
and
when
he
came
he
spent
most
of
the
time
in
long
professional
discussions
with
senior
they
told
me
he
was
devoted
to
his
profession
and
it
really
seemed
as
if
he
had
not
time
to
think
of
any
thing
else
neither
had
i
very
much
time
for
brooding
over
any
subject
for
guests
began
to
frequent
the
house
which
became
much
gayer
senior
said
now
there
was
a
young
hostess
in
it
the
quiet
evenings
of
autumn
and
winter
were
gone
and
instead
of
them
our
engagements
accumulated
on
our
hands
until
i
very
rarely
met
martin
except
at
some
entertainment
where
we
were
surrounded
by
strangers
martin
was
certainly
at
a
disadvantage
among
a
crowd
of
mere
acquaintances
where
john
was
quite
at
home
he
was
not
as
handsome
and
he
did
not
possess
the
same
ease
and
animation
so
he
was
a
little
apt
to
get
into
corners
with
senior
scientific
friends
and
to
be
somewhat
awkward
and
dull
if
he
were
forced
into
gayer
society
john
called
him
glum
but
he
was
not
glum
i
resented
that
till
john
begged
my
pardon
martin
did
not
smile
as
quickly
as
john
he
was
not
forever
ready
with
a
simper
but
when
he
did
smile
it
had
ten
times
more
expression
i
liked
to
watch
for
it
for
the
light
that
came
into
his
eyes
now
and
then
breaking
through
his
gravity
as
the
sun
breaks
through
the
clouds
on
a
dull
day
perhaps
he
thought
i
liked
to
be
free
yes
free
from
tyranny
but
not
free
from
love
it
is
a
poor
thing
to
have
no
one
love
encircling
you
a
poor
freedom
that
a
little
clew
came
to
my
hand
one
day
the
other
end
of
which
might
lead
me
to
the
secret
of
martin
reserve
and
gloom
he
and
senior
were
talking
together
as
they
paced
to
and
fro
about
the
lawn
coming
up
the
walk
from
the
to
the
house
and
then
back
again
i
was
seated
just
within
the
window
which
was
open
they
knew
i
was
there
but
they
did
not
guess
how
keen
my
hearing
was
for
any
thing
that
martin
said
it
was
only
a
word
or
two
here
and
there
that
i
caught
if
you
were
not
in
the
way
said
senior
john
would
have
a
good
chance
and
there
is
no
one
in
the
world
i
would
sooner
welcome
as
a
daughter
they
are
like
one
another
answered
martin
have
you
never
seen
it
what
more
they
said
i
did
not
hear
but
it
seemed
a
little
clearer
to
me
after
that
why
martin
kept
aloof
from
me
and
left
me
to
ride
and
talk
and
laugh
with
his
friend
jack
why
they
did
not
know
that
i
was
happier
silent
beside
martin
than
laughing
most
merrily
with
john
so
little
did
they
understand
me
just
before
lent
which
was
a
busy
season
with
him
monsieur
laurentie
paid
us
his
promised
visit
and
brought
us
news
from
the
money
that
had
been
lying
in
the
bank
which
i
could
not
touch
whatever
my
necessities
were
had
accumulated
to
more
than
three
thousand
pounds
and
out
of
this
sum
were
to
come
the
funds
for
making
the
parish
in
normandy
nothing
could
exceed
monsieur
laurentie
happiness
in
choosing
a
design
for
a
village
fountain
and
in
examining
plans
for
a
village
hospital
for
in
case
any
serious
illness
should
break
out
again
among
them
a
simple
little
hospital
was
to
be
built
upon
the
brow
of
the
hill
where
the
wind
sweeps
across
leagues
of
and
heather
i
am
too
happy
madame
said
the
curé
my
people
will
die
no
more
of
fever
and
we
will
teach
them
many
english
ways
when
will
you
come
again
and
see
what
you
have
done
for
us
i
will
come
in
the
autumn
i
answered
and
you
will
come
alone
he
continued
yes
quite
alone
i
answered
or
with
minima
only
chapter
the
breaking
the
ice
yet
while
i
told
monsieur
laurentie
seriously
that
i
should
go
alone
to
in
the
autumn
i
did
not
altogether
believe
it
we
often
speak
in
even
to
ourselves
senior
lawn
in
which
he
takes
great
pride
slopes
gently
down
to
the
river
and
ends
with
a
stone
parapet
over
which
it
is
exceedingly
pleasant
to
lean
and
watch
idly
the
flowing
of
the
water
which
seems
to
loiter
almost
reluctantly
before
passing
on
to
westminster
and
the
wharves
and
docks
of
the
city
on
the
opposite
bank
grows
a
cluster
of
cedars
with
rich
branches
showing
nearly
black
against
the
pale
blue
of
the
sky
in
our
own
lawn
there
stand
three
fine
elms
a
colony
for
under
which
the
turf
is
carefully
kept
as
smooth
and
soft
as
velvet
and
seats
are
set
beneath
their
shadow
where
one
can
linger
for
hours
seeing
the
steamers
and
passing
to
and
fro
and
catching
now
and
then
a
burst
of
music
or
laughter
softened
a
little
by
the
distance
my
childhood
had
trained
me
to
be
fond
of
living
and
when
the
spring
came
i
spent
most
of
my
days
under
these
in
the
fitful
sunshine
and
showers
of
an
english
april
and
may
such
as
i
had
never
known
before
from
one
of
these
trees
i
could
see
very
well
any
one
who
went
in
or
out
through
the
gate
but
it
was
not
often
that
i
cared
to
sit
there
for
martin
came
only
in
an
evening
when
his
day
work
was
done
and
even
then
his
coming
was
an
uncertainty
john
seldom
missed
visiting
us
but
martin
was
often
absent
for
days
that
made
me
watch
all
the
more
eagerly
for
his
coming
and
feel
how
cruelly
fast
the
time
fled
when
he
was
with
us
but
one
sunday
afternoon
in
april
i
chose
my
seat
there
behind
the
tree
where
i
could
see
the
gate
without
being
too
plainly
seen
myself
martin
had
promised
senior
he
would
come
down
to
fulham
with
john
that
afternoon
if
possible
the
river
was
quieter
than
on
other
days
and
all
the
world
seemed
calmer
it
was
such
a
day
as
the
one
in
sark
two
years
ago
when
i
slipped
from
the
cliffs
and
tardif
was
obliged
to
go
across
to
guernsey
to
fetch
a
doctor
for
me
i
wondered
if
martin
ever
thought
of
it
on
such
a
day
as
this
but
men
do
not
remember
little
things
like
these
as
women
do
i
heard
the
click
of
the
gate
at
last
and
looking
round
the
great
trunk
of
the
tree
i
saw
them
come
in
together
john
and
martin
he
had
kept
his
promise
then
minima
was
gone
out
somewhere
with
senior
or
she
would
have
run
to
meet
them
and
so
brought
them
to
the
place
where
i
was
however
they
might
see
my
dress
if
they
chose
they
ought
to
see
it
i
was
not
going
to
stand
up
and
show
myself
if
they
were
anxious
to
find
me
and
come
to
me
it
was
quite
simple
enough
but
my
heart
sank
when
martin
marched
straight
on
and
entered
the
house
alone
while
john
came
as
direct
as
an
arrow
toward
me
they
knew
i
was
there
then
yet
martin
avoided
me
and
left
his
friend
to
chatter
and
laugh
the
time
away
i
was
in
no
mood
for
laughing
i
could
rather
have
wept
bitter
tears
of
vexation
and
disappointment
but
john
was
near
enough
now
for
me
to
discern
a
singular
gravity
upon
his
usually
gay
face
is
there
any
thing
the
matter
i
exclaimed
starting
to
my
feet
and
hastening
to
meet
him
he
led
me
back
again
silently
to
my
seat
and
sat
down
beside
me
still
in
silence
strange
conduct
in
john
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
i
said
not
doubting
now
that
there
was
some
trouble
at
hand
john
face
flushed
and
he
threw
his
hat
down
on
the
grass
and
pushed
his
hair
back
from
his
forehead
then
he
laid
his
hand
upon
mine
for
a
moment
only
olivia
he
said
very
seriously
do
you
love
me
the
question
came
upon
me
like
a
shock
from
a
galvanic
battery
he
and
i
had
been
very
frank
and
friendly
together
a
pleasant
friendship
which
had
seemed
to
me
as
safe
as
that
of
a
brother
besides
he
knew
all
that
martin
had
done
and
borne
for
my
sake
with
my
disappointment
there
was
mingled
a
feeling
of
indignation
against
his
treachery
toward
his
friend
i
sat
watching
the
glistening
of
the
water
through
the
pillars
of
the
parapet
till
my
eyes
were
dazzled
i
scarcely
understand
what
you
say
i
answered
after
a
long
pause
you
know
i
care
for
you
all
if
you
mean
do
i
love
you
as
i
love
your
father
and
monsieur
laurentie
why
yes
i
do
very
good
olivia
he
said
that
was
so
odd
of
him
that
i
turned
and
looked
steadily
into
his
face
it
was
not
half
as
grave
as
before
and
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
as
if
another
half
minute
would
make
him
as
gay
and
as
ever
whatever
did
you
come
and
ask
me
such
a
question
for
i
inquired
rather
pettishly
was
there
any
harm
in
it
he
rejoined
yes
there
was
harm
in
it
i
answered
it
has
made
me
very
uncomfortable
i
thought
you
were
going
out
of
your
mind
if
you
meant
nothing
but
to
make
me
say
i
liked
you
you
should
have
expressed
yourself
differently
of
course
i
love
you
all
and
all
alike
very
good
he
said
again
i
felt
so
angry
that
i
was
about
to
get
up
and
go
away
to
my
own
room
but
he
caught
my
dress
and
implored
me
to
stay
a
little
longer
i
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
he
said
i
promised
that
dear
old
dolt
martin
to
come
straight
to
you
and
ask
you
if
you
loved
me
in
so
many
words
well
i
kept
my
promise
and
now
i
go
and
tell
him
you
say
you
love
us
all
and
all
alike
no
i
answered
you
shall
not
go
and
tell
him
that
what
could
put
it
into
martin
head
that
i
was
in
love
with
you
why
should
you
be
in
love
with
me
retorted
john
martin
assures
me
that
i
am
much
handsomer
than
he
is
a
more
eligible
in
every
respect
i
suppose
i
shall
have
an
income
apart
from
our
practice
at
least
ten
times
larger
than
his
i
am
much
more
sought
after
generally
one
can
not
help
seeing
that
why
should
you
not
be
in
love
with
me
i
did
not
deign
to
reply
to
him
and
jack
leaned
forward
a
little
to
look
into
my
face
olivia
he
continued
that
is
part
of
what
martin
says
we
have
just
been
speaking
of
you
as
we
came
down
to
fulham
never
before
he
maintains
he
is
bound
in
honor
to
leave
you
as
free
as
possible
to
make
your
choice
not
merely
between
us
but
from
the
number
of
fellows
who
have
found
their
way
down
here
since
you
came
you
made
one
fatal
mistake
he
says
through
your
complete
ignorance
of
the
world
and
it
is
his
duty
to
take
care
that
you
do
not
make
a
second
mistake
through
any
gratitude
you
might
feel
toward
him
he
would
not
be
satisfied
with
gratitude
besides
he
has
discovered
that
he
is
not
so
great
a
prize
as
he
fancied
as
long
as
he
lived
in
guernsey
and
you
are
a
richer
prize
than
you
seemed
to
be
then
with
your
fortune
you
ought
to
make
a
much
better
match
than
with
a
young
physician
who
has
to
push
his
way
among
a
host
of
competitors
lastly
martin
said
for
i
merely
repeating
his
own
arguments
to
you
you
think
i
can
put
her
happiness
and
mine
into
a
balance
and
coolly
calculate
which
has
the
greater
weight
if
i
had
to
choose
for
her
i
should
not
hesitate
between
you
and
me
now
i
have
told
you
the
sum
of
our
conversation
olivia
every
word
john
had
spoken
had
thrown
clearer
light
upon
conduct
he
had
been
afraid
i
should
feel
myself
bound
to
him
and
the
very
fact
that
he
had
once
told
me
he
loved
me
had
made
it
more
difficult
to
him
to
say
so
a
second
time
he
would
not
have
any
love
from
me
as
a
duty
if
i
did
not
love
him
fully
with
my
whole
heart
choosing
him
after
knowing
others
with
whom
i
could
compare
him
he
would
not
receive
any
lesser
gift
from
me
what
will
you
do
my
dear
olivia
asked
john
what
can
i
do
i
said
go
to
him
he
urged
he
is
alone
i
saw
him
a
moment
ago
looking
out
at
us
from
the
window
the
old
fellow
is
making
up
his
mind
to
see
you
and
me
happy
together
and
to
conceal
his
own
sorrow
god
bless
him
olivia
my
dear
girl
go
to
him
o
jack
i
cried
i
can
not
i
do
see
why
you
can
not
he
answered
gayly
you
are
trembling
and
your
face
goes
from
white
to
red
and
then
white
again
but
you
have
not
lost
the
use
of
your
limbs
or
your
tongue
if
you
take
my
arm
it
will
not
be
very
difficult
to
cross
the
lawn
come
he
is
the
best
fellow
living
and
worth
walking
a
dozen
yards
for
jack
drew
my
hand
through
his
arm
and
led
me
across
the
smooth
lawn
we
caught
a
glimpse
of
martin
looking
out
at
us
but
he
turned
away
in
an
instant
and
i
could
not
see
the
expression
of
his
face
would
he
think
we
were
coming
to
tell
him
that
he
had
wasted
all
his
love
upon
a
girl
not
worthy
of
a
tenth
part
of
it
the
glass
doors
which
opened
upon
the
lawn
had
been
thrown
back
all
day
and
we
could
see
distinctly
into
the
room
martin
was
standing
at
the
other
end
of
it
apparently
absorbed
in
examining
a
painting
which
he
must
have
seen
a
thousand
times
the
doors
creaked
a
little
as
i
passed
through
them
but
he
did
not
turn
round
jack
gave
my
hand
a
parting
squeeze
and
left
me
there
in
the
open
doorway
scarcely
knowing
whether
to
go
on
and
speak
to
martin
or
run
away
to
my
room
and
leave
him
to
take
his
own
time
i
believe
i
should
have
run
away
but
i
heard
minima
voice
behind
me
calling
shrilly
to
john
and
i
could
not
bear
to
face
him
again
taking
my
courage
in
both
hands
i
stepped
quickly
across
the
floor
for
if
i
had
hesitated
longer
my
heart
would
have
failed
me
scarcely
a
moment
had
passed
since
jack
left
me
and
martin
had
not
turned
his
head
yet
it
seemed
an
age
martin
i
whispered
as
i
stood
close
behind
him
how
could
you
be
so
foolish
as
to
send
john
to
me
chapter
the
palmy
days
we
were
married
as
soon
as
the
season
was
over
when
fashionable
patients
were
all
going
away
from
town
ours
was
a
very
quiet
wedding
for
i
had
no
friends
on
my
side
and
martin
cousin
julia
could
not
come
for
she
had
a
baby
not
a
month
old
and
captain
carey
could
not
leave
them
johanna
carey
and
minima
were
my
bridesmaids
and
jack
was
martin
groomsman
on
our
way
home
from
switzerland
in
the
early
autumn
we
went
down
from
paris
to
falaise
and
through
noireau
to
from
falaise
every
part
of
the
road
was
full
of
associations
to
me
this
was
the
long
weary
journey
which
minima
and
i
had
taken
alone
in
a
dark
november
night
and
here
were
the
narrow
and
dirty
streets
of
noireau
which
we
had
so
often
trodden
cold
and
hungry
and
friendless
martin
said
little
about
it
but
i
knew
by
his
face
and
by
the
tender
care
he
lavished
upon
me
that
his
mind
was
as
full
of
it
as
mine
was
there
was
no
reason
for
us
to
stay
even
a
day
in
noireau
and
we
hurried
through
it
on
our
way
to
this
road
was
still
more
memorable
to
me
for
we
had
traversed
it
on
foot
see
martin
i
cried
there
is
the
trunk
of
the
tree
still
where
minima
and
i
sat
down
to
rest
i
am
glad
the
tree
is
there
yet
if
we
were
not
in
a
hurry
you
and
i
would
sit
there
now
it
is
so
lonely
and
still
and
scarcely
a
creature
passes
this
way
it
is
delicious
to
be
lonely
sometimes
how
and
famished
we
were
walking
along
this
rough
part
of
the
road
martin
i
almost
wish
our
little
minima
were
with
us
there
is
the
common
if
you
will
look
steadily
you
can
just
see
the
top
of
the
cross
against
the
black
line
of
on
the
far
side
i
was
getting
so
excited
that
i
could
speak
no
longer
but
martin
held
my
hand
in
his
and
i
clasped
it
more
and
more
tightly
as
we
drew
nearer
to
the
cross
where
minima
and
i
had
sat
down
at
the
foot
forlorn
and
lost
in
the
dark
shadows
of
the
coming
night
was
it
possible
that
i
was
the
same
olivia
but
as
we
came
in
sight
of
the
little
grove
of
cypresses
and
yews
we
could
discern
a
crowd
of
women
in
their
caps
and
of
men
and
boys
in
blue
blouses
the
hollow
beat
of
a
drum
reached
our
ears
afar
off
and
after
it
the
shrill
notes
of
a
violin
and
fife
playing
a
merry
tune
monsieur
laurentie
appeared
in
the
foreground
of
the
multitude
bareheaded
long
before
we
reached
the
spot
o
martin
i
said
let
us
get
out
and
send
the
carriage
back
and
walk
up
with
them
to
the
village
and
my
wife
luggage
he
answered
and
all
the
toys
and
presents
she
has
brought
from
paris
it
was
true
that
the
carriage
was
inconveniently
full
of
parcels
for
i
do
not
think
that
i
had
forgotten
one
of
monsieur
laurentie
people
but
it
would
not
be
possible
to
ride
among
them
while
they
were
walking
every
man
will
carry
something
i
said
martin
i
must
get
out
it
was
monsieur
laurentie
who
opened
the
for
me
but
the
people
did
not
give
him
time
for
a
ceremonious
salutation
they
thronged
about
us
with
as
hearty
as
an
english
hurrah
all
the
world
is
here
to
meet
us
monsieur
i
said
madame
i
have
also
the
honor
of
presenting
to
you
two
strangers
from
england
answered
monsieur
laurentie
while
the
people
fell
back
to
make
way
for
them
jack
and
minima
both
wild
with
delight
we
learned
afterward
as
we
marched
up
the
valley
to
that
senior
had
taken
jack
place
in
brook
street
and
insisted
upon
him
and
minima
giving
us
this
surprise
our
procession
headed
by
the
drum
the
fife
and
the
violin
passed
through
the
village
street
from
every
window
of
which
a
little
flag
fluttered
gayly
and
stopped
before
the
presbytery
where
monsieur
laurentie
dismissed
it
after
a
last
the
next
stage
of
our
homeward
journey
was
made
in
monsieur
à
from
to
granville
jack
and
minima
had
returned
direct
to
england
but
we
were
to
visit
guernsey
on
the
way
captain
carey
and
julia
made
it
a
point
that
we
should
go
to
see
them
and
their
baby
before
settling
down
in
our
london
home
martin
was
welcomed
with
almost
as
much
enthusiasm
in
as
i
had
been
in
little
from
our
room
in
captain
carey
house
i
could
look
at
sark
lying
along
the
sea
with
a
belt
of
foam
encircling
it
at
times
early
in
the
morning
or
when
the
sunset
light
fell
upon
it
i
could
distinguish
the
old
windmill
and
the
church
breaking
the
level
line
of
the
summit
and
i
could
even
see
the
brow
of
the
knoll
behind
tardifs
cottage
but
day
after
day
the
sea
between
us
was
rough
and
the
westerly
breeze
blew
across
the
atlantic
driving
the
waves
before
it
there
was
no
steamer
going
across
and
captain
carey
yacht
could
not
brave
the
winds
i
began
to
be
afraid
that
martin
and
i
would
not
visit
the
place
which
of
all
others
in
this
half
of
the
world
was
dearest
to
me
said
martin
one
night
after
scanning
the
sunset
the
sky
and
the
if
you
can
be
up
at
five
we
will
cross
to
sark
i
was
up
at
four
in
the
first
gray
dawn
of
a
september
morning
we
had
the
yacht
to
ourselves
for
captain
carey
declined
running
the
risk
of
being
on
the
island
a
risk
which
we
were
willing
to
chance
the
havre
gosselin
was
still
in
morning
shadow
when
we
ran
into
it
but
the
water
between
us
and
guernsey
was
sparkling
and
dancing
in
the
early
light
as
we
slowly
climbed
the
rough
path
of
the
cliff
my
eyes
were
dazzled
with
the
sunshine
and
dim
with
tears
when
i
first
caught
sight
of
the
little
cottage
of
tardif
who
was
stretching
out
his
nets
on
the
stone
causeway
under
the
windows
martin
called
to
him
and
he
flung
down
his
nets
and
ran
to
meet
us
we
are
come
to
spend
the
day
with
you
tardif
i
cried
when
he
was
within
hearing
of
my
voice
it
will
be
a
day
from
heaven
he
said
taking
off
his
fisherman
cap
and
looking
round
at
the
blue
sky
with
its
scattered
clouds
and
the
sea
with
its
scattered
islets
it
was
like
a
day
from
heaven
we
wandered
about
the
cliffs
visiting
every
spot
which
was
most
memorable
to
either
of
us
and
tardif
rowed
us
in
his
boat
past
the
entrance
of
the
gouliot
caves
he
was
very
quiet
but
he
listened
to
our
free
talk
together
for
i
could
not
think
of
good
old
tardif
as
any
stranger
and
he
seemed
to
watch
us
both
with
a
faithful
quiet
look
upon
his
face
sometimes
i
fancied
he
did
not
bear
what
we
were
saying
and
again
his
eyes
would
brighten
with
a
sudden
gleam
as
if
his
whole
soul
and
heart
shone
through
them
upon
us
it
was
the
last
day
of
our
holiday
for
in
the
morning
we
were
about
to
return
to
london
and
to
work
but
it
was
such
a
perfect
day
as
i
had
never
known
before
you
are
quite
happy
martin
dobrée
said
tardif
to
me
when
we
were
parting
from
him
i
did
not
know
i
could
ever
be
so
happy
i
answered
we
saw
him
to
the
last
moment
standing
on
the
cliff
and
waving
his
hat
to
us
high
above
his
head
now
and
then
there
came
a
shout
across
the
water
before
we
were
quite
beyond
we
heard
tardif
voice
calling
amid
the
splashing
of
the
waves
god
be
with
you
my
friends
adieu
chapter
the
a
postscript
by
martin
dobrée
you
may
describe
to
a
second
person
with
the
most
minute
and
exact
fidelity
in
your
power
the
leading
and
critical
events
in
your
life
and
you
will
find
that
some
trifle
of
his
own
experience
is
ten
times
more
vivid
to
his
mind
you
narrate
to
your
friend
whom
you
have
not
met
for
many
years
the
incident
that
has
turned
the
whole
current
of
your
existence
and
after
a
minute
or
two
of
musing
he
asks
you
do
you
remember
the
day
we
two
went
on
gull
cliff
that
day
of
boyish
daring
and
of
narrow
escapes
is
more
real
to
him
than
your
deepest
troubles
or
keenest
joys
the
brain
receives
but
slightly
impressions
i
had
told
olivia
faithfully
all
my
dilemmas
with
regard
to
julia
and
the
careys
and
she
had
seemed
to
listen
with
intense
interest
certainly
it
was
during
those
four
bewildering
and
enchanted
months
immediately
preceding
our
marriage
and
no
doubt
the
narrative
was
interwoven
with
many
a
topic
of
quite
a
different
character
however
that
might
be
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
olivia
was
not
half
as
nervous
and
anxious
as
i
felt
when
we
were
nearing
guernsey
on
our
visit
to
julia
and
captain
carey
julia
had
seen
her
but
once
and
that
for
a
few
minutes
only
in
sark
on
her
account
she
had
suffered
the
severest
mortification
a
woman
can
undergo
how
would
she
receive
my
wife
olivia
did
not
know
though
i
did
that
julia
was
somewhat
frigid
and
distant
in
her
manner
even
while
thoroughly
hospitable
in
her
welcome
olivia
felt
the
hospitality
i
felt
the
frigidity
julia
called
her
mrs
dobrée
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
been
addressed
by
that
name
and
her
blush
and
smile
were
exquisite
to
me
but
they
did
not
thaw
julia
in
the
least
i
began
to
fear
that
there
would
be
between
them
that
strange
uncomfortable
coolness
which
so
often
exists
between
the
two
women
a
man
most
loves
it
was
the
baby
that
did
it
nothing
on
earth
could
be
more
charming
or
more
winning
than
olivia
delight
over
that
child
it
was
the
first
baby
she
had
ever
had
in
her
arms
she
told
us
and
to
see
her
sitting
in
the
low
with
her
head
bent
over
it
and
to
watch
her
dainty
way
of
handling
it
was
quite
a
picture
captain
carey
had
an
artist
eye
and
was
in
raptures
julia
had
a
mother
eye
and
was
so
won
by
olivia
admiration
of
her
baby
that
the
thin
crust
of
ice
melted
from
her
like
the
arctic
snows
before
a
greenland
summer
i
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
when
two
days
or
so
before
we
left
guernsey
julia
spoke
to
us
with
some
solemnity
of
tone
and
expression
my
dear
olivia
she
said
and
you
martin
arnold
and
i
would
consider
it
a
token
of
your
friendship
for
us
both
if
you
two
would
stand
as
sponsors
for
our
child
with
the
greatest
pleasure
julia
i
replied
and
olivia
crossed
the
hearth
to
kiss
her
and
sat
down
on
the
sofa
at
her
side
we
have
decided
upon
calling
her
olivia
continued
julia
stroking
my
wife
hand
with
a
caressing
touch
olivia
carey
that
sounds
extremely
well
and
is
quite
new
in
the
island
i
think
it
sounds
even
better
than
olivia
dobrée
as
we
all
agreed
that
no
name
could
sound
better
or
be
newer
in
guernsey
that
question
was
immediately
settled
there
was
no
time
for
delay
and
the
next
morning
we
carried
the
child
to
church
to
be
christened
as
we
were
returning
homeward
julia
whose
face
had
worn
its
softest
expression
pressed
my
arm
with
a
clasp
which
made
me
look
down
upon
her
questioningly
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
and
her
mouth
quivered
olivia
and
captain
carey
were
walking
on
in
front
at
a
more
rapid
pace
than
ours
so
that
we
were
in
fact
alone
what
is
the
matter
i
asked
hastily
o
martin
she
exclaimed
we
are
both
so
happy
after
all
i
wish
my
poor
darling
aunt
could
only
have
foreseen
this
but
do
you
think
as
we
are
both
so
happy
we
might
just
go
and
see
my
poor
uncle
kate
daltrey
is
away
in
jersey
i
know
that
for
certain
and
he
is
alone
it
would
give
him
so
much
pleasure
surely
you
can
forgive
him
now
by
all
means
let
us
go
i
answered
i
had
not
heard
even
his
name
mentioned
before
by
any
one
of
my
old
friends
in
guernsey
but
as
julia
said
i
was
so
happy
that
i
was
ready
to
forgive
and
forget
all
ancient
grievances
olivia
and
captain
carey
were
already
out
of
sight
and
we
turned
into
a
street
leading
to
vauvert
road
they
live
in
lodgings
now
remarked
julia
as
we
went
slowly
up
the
steep
street
and
nobody
visits
them
not
one
of
my
uncle
old
friends
they
have
plenty
to
live
upon
but
it
is
all
her
money
i
do
not
mean
to
let
them
got
upon
visiting
terms
with
me
at
least
not
kate
daltrey
you
know
the
house
martin
i
knew
nearly
every
house
in
but
this
i
remembered
particularly
as
being
the
one
where
foster
had
lodged
when
she
was
in
guernsey
upon
inquiring
for
dobrée
we
were
ushered
at
once
without
warning
into
his
presence
even
i
should
scarcely
have
recognized
him
his
figure
was
sunken
and
bent
and
his
clothes
which
were
shabby
sat
in
wrinkles
upon
him
his
crisp
white
hair
had
grown
thin
and
limp
and
hung
untidily
about
his
face
he
had
not
shaved
for
a
week
his
waistcoat
was
sprinkled
over
with
snuff
in
which
he
had
indulged
but
sparingly
in
former
years
there
was
not
a
trace
of
his
old
jauntiness
and
display
this
was
a
rusty
dejected
old
man
with
the
very
plainly
marked
upon
his
features
father
i
said
uncle
cried
julia
running
to
him
and
giving
him
a
kiss
which
she
had
not
meant
to
do
i
am
sure
when
we
entered
the
house
he
shed
a
few
tears
at
the
sight
of
us
in
a
maudlin
manner
and
he
continued
languid
and
sluggish
all
through
the
interview
it
struck
me
more
forcibly
than
any
other
change
could
have
done
that
he
never
once
appeared
to
pluck
up
any
spirit
or
attempted
to
recall
a
spark
of
his
ancient
sprightliness
he
spoke
more
to
julia
than
to
me
my
love
he
said
i
believed
i
knew
a
good
deal
about
women
but
lived
to
find
out
my
mistake
you
and
your
beloved
aunt
were
angels
this
one
never
lets
me
have
a
penny
of
my
own
and
she
locks
up
my
best
suit
when
she
goes
from
home
that
is
to
prevent
me
going
among
my
own
friends
she
is
in
jersey
now
but
she
would
not
hear
a
word
of
me
going
with
her
not
one
word
the
bible
says
is
cruel
as
the
grave
the
coals
thereof
are
coals
of
fire
which
hath
a
most
vehement
flame
kate
is
jealous
of
me
i
get
nothing
but
black
looks
and
cold
shoulders
there
never
lived
a
cat
and
dog
that
did
not
lead
a
more
comfortable
life
than
kate
leads
me
you
shall
come
and
see
arnold
and
me
sometimes
uncle
said
julia
she
wo
let
me
he
replied
with
fresh
tears
she
wo
let
me
mention
your
name
or
go
past
your
house
i
should
very
much
like
to
see
martin
wife
a
very
pretty
creature
they
say
she
is
but
i
dare
not
o
julia
how
little
a
man
knows
what
is
before
him
we
did
not
prolong
our
visit
for
it
was
no
pleasure
to
any
one
of
us
dobrée
himself
seemed
relieved
when
we
spoke
of
going
away
he
and
i
shook
hands
with
one
another
gravely
it
was
the
first
time
we
had
done
so
since
he
had
announced
his
intention
of
marrying
kate
daltrey
my
son
he
said
if
ever
you
should
find
yourself
a
widower
be
very
careful
how
you
select
your
second
wife
these
were
his
parting
words
words
which
chafed
me
sorely
as
a
young
husband
in
his
honeymoon
i
looked
round
when
we
were
out
of
the
house
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
his
withered
face
and
ragged
white
hair
as
he
peeped
from
behind
the
curtain
at
us
julia
and
i
walked
on
in
silence
till
we
reached
her
threshold
yet
i
am
not
sorry
we
went
martin
she
observed
in
a
tone
as
if
she
thus
summed
up
a
discussion
with
herself
nor
was
i
sorry
a
few
days
after
our
return
to
london
as
i
was
going
home
to
dinner
i
met
about
along
brook
street
foster
for
the
first
time
since
my
marriage
i
was
glad
to
be
alone
i
would
not
have
had
olivia
with
me
on
any
account
but
the
woman
was
coming
away
from
our
house
and
a
sudden
fear
flashed
across
me
could
she
have
been
annoying
my
olivia
have
you
been
to
see
me
i
asked
her
abruptly
why
should
i
come
to
see
you
she
retorted
nor
my
wife
i
said
why
should
i
go
to
see
mrs
dobrée
she
asked
again
i
felt
that
it
was
necessary
to
secure
olivia
and
to
gain
this
end
i
must
be
firm
but
the
poor
creature
looked
miserable
and
unhappy
and
i
could
not
be
harsh
toward
her
come
foster
i
said
let
us
talk
reasonably
together
you
know
as
as
well
as
i
do
you
have
no
claim
upon
my
wife
and
i
can
not
have
her
disturbed
and
distressed
by
seeing
you
i
wish
her
to
forget
all
the
past
did
i
not
fulfil
my
promise
to
foster
did
i
not
do
all
i
could
for
him

and
irresolute

she

early
age

a
tight
hand

authority
