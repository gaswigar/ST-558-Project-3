crime
its
cause
and
treatment
by
clarence
darrow
preface
this
book
comes
from
the
reflections
and
experience
of
more
than
forty
years
spent
in
court
aside
from
the
practice
of
my
profession
the
topics
i
have
treated
are
such
as
have
always
held
my
interest
and
inspired
a
taste
for
books
that
discuss
the
human
machine
with
its
manifestations
and
the
causes
of
its
varied
activity
i
have
endeavored
to
present
the
latest
scientific
thought
and
investigation
bearing
upon
the
question
of
human
conduct
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
an
original
investigator
nor
an
authority
on
biology
psychology
or
philosophy
i
have
simply
been
a
student
giving
the
subject
such
attention
as
i
could
during
a
fairly
busy
life
no
doubt
some
of
the
scientific
conclusions
stated
are
still
debatable
and
may
finally
be
rejected
the
scientific
mind
holds
opinions
tentatively
and
is
always
ready
to
reexamine
modify
or
discard
as
new
evidence
comes
to
light
naturally
in
a
book
of
this
sort
there
are
many
references
to
the
human
mind
and
its
activities
in
most
books
whether
scientific
or
not
the
mind
has
generally
been
more
closely
associated
with
the
brain
than
any
other
portion
of
the
body
as
a
rule
i
have
assumed
that
this
view
of
mind
and
brain
is
correct
often
i
have
referred
to
it
as
a
matter
of
course
i
am
aware
that
the
latest
investigations
seem
to
establish
the
mind
more
as
a
function
of
the
nervous
system
and
the
vital
organs
than
of
the
brain
whether
the
brain
is
like
a
telephone
exchange
and
is
only
concerned
with
automatically
receiving
and
sending
out
messages
to
the
different
parts
of
the
body
or
whether
it
registers
impressions
and
compares
them
and
is
the
seat
of
consciousness
and
thought
is
not
important
in
this
discussion
whatever
mind
may
be
or
through
whatever
part
of
the
human
system
it
may
function
can
make
no
difference
in
the
conclusions
i
have
reached
the
physical
origin
of
such
abnormalities
of
the
mind
as
are
called
criminal
is
a
comparatively
new
idea
the
whole
subject
has
long
been
dealt
with
from
the
standpoint
of
metaphysics
man
has
slowly
banished
chance
from
the
material
world
and
left
behavior
alone
outside
the
realm
of
cause
and
effect
it
has
not
been
long
since
insanity
was
treated
as
a
moral
defect
it
is
now
universally
accepted
as
a
functional
defect
of
the
human
structure
in
its
relation
to
environment
my
main
effort
is
to
show
that
the
laws
that
control
human
behavior
are
as
fixed
and
certain
as
those
that
control
the
physical
world
in
fact
that
the
manifestations
of
the
mind
and
the
actions
of
men
are
a
part
of
the
physical
world
i
am
fully
aware
that
this
book
will
be
regarded
as
a
plea
or
an
apology
for
the
criminal
to
hold
him
morally
blameless
could
be
nothing
else
still
if
man
actions
are
governed
by
natural
law
the
sooner
it
is
recognized
and
understood
the
sooner
will
sane
treatment
be
adopted
in
dealing
with
crime
the
sooner
too
will
sensible
and
humane
remedies
be
found
for
the
treatment
and
cure
of
this
most
perplexing
and
painful
manifestation
of
human
behavior
i
have
tried
conscientiously
to
understand
the
manifold
actions
of
men
and
if
i
have
to
some
degree
succeeded
then
to
that
extent
i
have
explained
and
excused
i
am
convinced
that
if
we
were
and
we
could
not
condemn
i
have
not
thought
it
best
to
encumber
the
book
with
references
and
for
the
reason
that
statistics
and
opinions
on
this
subject
are
conflicting
and
imperfect
and
the
results
after
all
must
rest
on
a
broad
scientific
understanding
of
life
and
the
laws
that
control
human
action
although
the
conclusions
arrived
at
are
in
variance
with
popular
opinions
and
practice
i
am
convinced
that
they
are
old
truths
and
are
in
keeping
with
the
best
thought
of
the
time
i
am
aware
that
scientifically
the
words
crime
and
criminal
should
not
be
used
these
words
are
associated
with
the
idea
of
uncaused
and
voluntary
actions
the
whole
field
is
a
part
of
human
behavior
and
should
not
be
separated
from
the
other
manifestations
of
life
i
have
retained
the
words
because
they
have
a
popular
significance
which
is
easy

follow

crime
its
cause
and
treatment
i
what
is
crime
there
can
be
no
sane
discussion
of
crime
and
criminals
without
an
investigation
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
a
large
majority
of
men
even
among
the
educated
speak
of
a
criminal
as
if
the
word
had
a
clearly
defined
meaning
and
as
if
men
were
divided
by
a
plain
and
distinct
line
into
the
criminal
and
the
virtuous
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
no
such
division
and
from
the
nature
of
things
there
never
can
be
such
a
line
strictly
speaking
a
crime
is
an
act
forbidden
by
the
law
of
the
land
and
one
which
is
considered
sufficiently
serious
to
warrant
providing
penalties
for
its
commission
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
this
act
is
either
good
or
bad
the
punishment
follows
for
the
violation
of
the
law
and
not
necessarily
for
any
moral
transgression
no
doubt
most
of
the
things
forbidden
by
the
penal
code
are
such
as
are
injurious
to
the
organized
society
of
the
time
and
place
and
are
usually
of
such
a
character
as
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
in
most
countries
have
been
classed
as
criminal
but
even
then
it
does
not
always
follow
that
the
violator
of
the
law
is
not
a
person
of
higher
type
than
the
majority
who
are
directly
and
indirectly
responsible
for
the
law
it
is
apparent
that
a
thing
is
not
necessarily
bad
because
it
is
forbidden
by
the
law
legislators
are
forever
repealing
and
abolishing
criminal
statutes
and
organized
society
is
constantly
ignoring
laws
until
they
fall
into
disuse
and
die
the
laws
against
witchcraft
the
long
line
of
blue
laws
the
laws
affecting
religious
beliefs
and
many
social
customs
are
examples
of
legal
and
innocent
acts
which
legislatures
and
courts
have
once
made
criminal
not
only
are
criminal
statutes
always
dying
by
repeal
or
repeated
violation
but
every
time
a
legislature
meets
it
changes
penalties
for
existing
crimes
and
makes
criminal
certain
acts
that
were
not
forbidden
before
judging
from
the
kind
of
men
sent
to
the
state
legislatures
and
to
congress
the
fact
that
certain
things
are
forbidden
does
not
mean
that
these
things
are
necessarily
evil
but
rather
that
politicians
believe
there
is
a
demand
for
such
legislation
from
the
class
of
society
that
is
most
powerful
in
political
action
no
one
who
examines
the
question
can
be
satisfied
that
a
thing
is
intrinsically
wrong
because
it
is
forbidden
by
a
legislative
body
other
more
or
less
popular
opinions
of
the
way
to
determine
right
or
wrong
are
found
to
be
no
more
satisfactory
many
believe
that
the
question
of
whether
an
act
is
right
or
wrong
is
to
be
settled
by
a
religious
doctrine
but
the
difficulties
are
still
greater
in
this
direction
first
of
all
this
involves
a
thorough
and
judicial
inquiry
into
the
merits
of
many
if
not
all
forms
of
religion
an
investigation
which
has
never
been
made
and
from
the
nature
of
things
can
not
be
made
the
fact
is
that
one
religious
opinions
are
settled
long
before
he
begins
to
investigate
and
quite
by
other
processes
than
reason
then
too
all
religious
precepts
rest
on
interpretation
and
even
the
things
that
seem
the
plainest
have
ever
been
subject
to
manifold
and
sometimes
conflicting
construction
few
if
any
religious
commands
can
be
or
ever
were
implicitly
relied
on
without
interpretation
the
command
thou
shalt
not
kill
seems
plain
but
does
even
this
furnish
an
infallible
rule
of
conduct
of
course
this
commandment
could
not
be
meant
to
forbid
killing
animals
yet
there
are
many
people
who
believe
that
it
does
or
at
least
should
no
christian
state
makes
it
apply
to
men
convicted
of
crime
or
against
killing
in
war
and
yet
a
considerable
minority
has
always
held
that
both
forms
of
killing
violate
the
commandment
neither
can
it
be
held
to
apply
to
accidental
killings
or
killings
in
or
in
defense
of
property
or
family
laws
too
provide
all
grades
of
punishment
for
different
kinds
of
killing
from
very
light
penalties
up
to
death
manifestly
then
the
commandment
must
be
interpreted
thou
shalt
not
kill
when
it
is
wrong
to
kill
and
therefore
it
furnishes
no
guide
to
conduct
as
well
say
thou
shalt
do
nothing
that
is
wrong
religious
doctrines
do
not
and
clearly
can
not
be
adopted
as
the
criminal
code
of
a
state
in
this
uncertainty
as
to
the
basis
of
good
and
bad
conduct
many
appeal
to
conscience
as
the
infallible
guide
what
is
conscience
it
manifestly
is
not
a
distinct
faculty
of
the
mind
and
if
it
were
would
it
be
more
reliable
than
the
other
faculties
it
has
been
often
said
that
some
divine
power
implanted
conscience
in
every
human
being
apart
from
the
question
of
whether
human
beings
are
different
in
kind
from
other
organisms
which
will
be
discussed
later
if
conscience
has
been
placed
in
man
by
a
divine
power
why
have
not
all
peoples
been
furnished
with
the
same
guide
there
is
no
doubt
that
all
men
of
any
mentality
have
what
is
called
a
conscience
that
is
a
feeling
that
certain
things
are
right
and
certain
other
things
are
wrong
this
conscience
does
not
affect
all
the
actions
of
life
but
probably
the
ones
which
to
them
are
the
most
important
it
varies
however
with
the
individual
what
reason
has
the
world
to
believe
that
conscience
is
a
correct
guide
to
right
and
wrong
the
origin
of
conscience
is
easily
understood
one
conscience
is
formed
as
his
habits
are
formed
by
the
time
and
place
in
which
he
lives
it
grows
with
his
teachings
his
habits
and
beliefs
with
most
people
it
takes
on
the
color
of
the
community
where
they
live
with
some
people
the
eating
of
pork
would
hurt
their
conscience
with
others
the
eating
of
any
meat
with
some
the
eating
of
meat
on
friday
and
with
others
the
playing
of
any
game
of
chance
for
money
or
the
playing
of
any
game
on
sunday
or
the
drinking
of
intoxicating
liquors
conscience
is
purely
a
matter
of
environment
education
and
temperament
and
is
no
more
infallible
than
any
habit
or
belief
whether
one
should
always
follow
his
own
conscience
is
another
question
and
can
not
be
confounded
with
the
question
as
to
whether
conscience
is
an
infallible
guide
to
conduct
some
seek
to
avoid
the
manifold
difficulties
of
the
problem
by
saying
that
a
criminal
is
one
who
is
but
does
this
bring
us
nearer
to
the
light
an
person
is
one
whose
life
is
hostile
to
the
organization
or
the
society
in
which
he
lives
one
who
injures
the
peace
contentment
prosperity
or
of
his
neighbors
or
the
political
or
social
organization
in
which
his
life
is
cast
in
this
sense
many
of
the
most
venerated
men
of
history
have
been
criminals
their
lives
and
teachings
have
been
in
greater
or
lesser
conflict
with
the
doctrines
habits
and
beliefs
of
the
communities
where
they
lived
from
the
nature
of
things
the
wise
man
and
the
idealist
can
never
be
contented
with
existing
things
and
their
lives
are
a
constant
battle
for
change
if
the
individual
should
be
punished
what
of
many
of
the
profiteers
and
captains
of
industry
who
manipulate
business
and
property
for
purely
selfish
ends
what
of
many
of
our
great
financiers
who
use
every
possible
reform
and
conventional
catch
word
as
a
means
of
affecting
public
opinion
so
that
they
may
control
the
resources
of
the
earth
and
exploit
their
fellows
for
their
own
gain
no
two
men
have
the
same
power
of
adaptation
to
the
group
and
it
is
quite
plain
that
the
ones
who
are
the
most
servile
and
obedient
to
the
opinions
and
life
of
the
crowd
are
the
greatest
enemies
to
change
and
individuality
the
fact
is
none
of
the
generally
accepted
theories
of
the
basis
of
right
and
wrong
has
ever
been
the
foundation
of
law
or
morals
the
basis
that
the
world
has
always
followed
and
perhaps
always
will
accept
is
not
hard
to
find
the
criminal
is
the
one
who
violates
habits
and
customs
of
life
the
of
the
community
where
he
lives
these
customs
and
must
be
so
important
in
the
opinion
of
the
community
as
to
make
their
violation
a
serious
affair
such
violation
is
considered
evil
regardless
of
whether
the
motives
are
selfish
or
unselfish
good
or
bad
the
have
a
certain
validity
and
a
certain
right
to
respect
but
no
one
who
believes
in
change
can
deny
that
they
are
a
hindrance
as
well
as
a
good
men
did
not
arrive
at
moral
ideas
by
a
scientific
or
a
religious
investigation
of
good
and
bad
of
right
and
wrong
of
social
or
life
man
lived
before
he
wrote
laws
and
before
he
philosophized
he
began
living
simply
and
automatically
he
adopted
various
taboos
which
to
him
were
omens
of
bad
luck
and
certain
charms
incantations
and
the
like
which
made
him
immune
from
all
sorts
of
objects
acts
and
phenomena
have
been
the
subjects
of
taboo
and
just
as
numerous
and
weird
have
been
the
charms
and
amulets
and
ceremonies
that
saved
him
from
the
dangers
that
everywhere
beset
his
way
the
life
of
the
primitive
human
being
was
a
journey
down
a
narrow
path
outside
were
infinite
dangers
from
which
magic
alone
could
make
him
safe
all
animal
life
automatically
groups
itself
more
or
less
closely
into
herds
buffaloes
horses
and
wolves
run
in
packs
some
of
these
groups
are
knit
closely
together
like
ants
and
bees
while
the
units
of
others
move
much
more
widely
apart
but
whatever
the
group
may
be
its
units
must
conform
if
the
wolf
gets
too
far
from
the
pack
it
suffers
or
dies
it
matters
not
whether
it
be
to
the
right
or
the
left
behind
or
ahead
it
must
stay
with
the
pack
or
be
lost
men
from
the
earliest
time
arranged
themselves
into
groups
they
traveled
in
a
certain
way
they
established
habits
and
customs
and
ways
of
life
these
were
born
long
before
human
laws
and
were
enforced
more
rigidly
than
the
statutes
of
a
later
age
slowly
men
embodied
their
taboos
their
incantations
their
habits
and
customs
into
religions
and
statutes
a
law
was
only
a
codification
of
a
habit
or
custom
that
long
ago
was
a
part
of
the
life
of
a
people
the
legislator
never
really
makes
the
law
he
simply
writes
in
the
books
what
has
already
become
the
rule
of
action
by
force
of
custom
or
opinion
or
at
least
what
he
thinks
has
become
a
law
one
class
of
men
has
always
been
anxious
to
keep
step
with
the
crowd
the
way
is
easier
and
the
rewards
more
certain
another
class
has
been
skeptical
and
resentful
of
the
crowd
these
men
have
refused
to
follow
down
the
beaten
path
they
strayed
into
the
wilderness
seeking
new
and
better
ways
sometimes
others
have
followed
and
a
shorter
path
was
made
often
they
have
perished
because
they
left
the
herd
in
the
sight
of
the
organized
unit
and
the
society
of
the
time
and
place
the
man
who
kept
the
path
did
right
the
man
who
tried
to
make
a
new
path
and
left
the
herd
did
wrong
in
its
last
analysis
the
criminal
is
the
one
who
leaves
the
pack
he
may
lag
behind
or
go
in
front
he
may
travel
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
he
may
be
better
or
worse
but
his
fate
is
the
same
the
beaten
path
however
formed
or
however
unscientific
has
some
right
to
exist
on
the
whole
it
has
tended
to
preserve
life
and
it
is
the
way
of
least
resistance
for
the
human
race
on
the
other
hand
it
is
not
the
best
and
the
way
has
ever
been
made
easier
by
those
who
have
violated
precepts
and
defied
some
of
the
concepts
of
the
time
both
ways
are
right
and
both
ways
are
wrong
the
conflict
between
the
two
ways
is
as
old
as
the
human
race
paths
and
customs
and
institutions
are
forever
changing
so
are
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
and
so
too
are
statutes
the
law
no
doubt
makes
it
harder
for
customs
and
habits
to
be
changed
for
it
adds
to
the
inertia
of
the
existing
thing
is
there
then
nothing
in
the
basis
of
right
and
wrong
that
answers
to
the
common
conception
of
these
words
there
are
some
customs
that
have
been
forbidden
longer
and
which
it
seems
must
necessarily
be
longer
prohibited
but
the
origin
of
all
is
the
same
a
changing
world
has
shown
how
the
most
shocking
crimes
punished
by
the
severest
penalties
have
been
taken
from
the
calendar
and
no
longer
even
bear
the
suspicion
of
wrong
religious
differences
witchcraft
and
sorcery
have
probably
brought
more
severe
punishments
than
any
other
acts
yet
a
change
of
habit
and
custom
and
belief
has
long
since
abolished
all
such
crimes
so
too
crimes
come
and
go
with
new
ideals
new
movements
and
conditions
the
largest
portion
of
our
criminal
code
deals
with
the
rights
of
property
yet
nearly
all
of
this
is
of
comparatively
modern
growth
a
new
emotion
may
take
possession
of
man
which
will
result
in
the
repeal
of
many
if
not
all
of
these
statutes
and
place
some
other
consideration
above
property
which
seems
to
be
the
controlling
emotion
of
today
crime
strictly
speaking
is
only
such
conduct
or
acts
as
are
forbidden
by
the
law
and
for
which
penalties
are
prescribed
the
classification
of
the
act
does
not
necessarily
have
relation
to
moral
conduct
this
can
not
be
fixed
by
any
exact
standard
there
is
no
straight
clear
line
between
the
good
and
bad
the
right
and
wrong
the
general
ways
of
determining
good
and
bad
conduct
are
of
little
value
the
line
between
the
two
is
always
uncertain
and
shifting
and
in
the
last
analysis
good
or
bad
conduct
rests
upon
the
the
habits
beliefs
and
customs
of
a
community
while
this
is
the
real
basis
of
judging
conduct
it
is
always
changing
and
from
the
nature
of
things
if
it
could
be
made
stable
it
would
mean
that
society
was
stratified
and
all
hope
of
improvement
dead
ii
purpose
of
punishment
neither
the
purpose
nor
the
effect
of
punishment
has
ever
been
definitely
agreed
upon
even
by
its
most
strenuous
advocates
so
long
as
punishment
persists
it
will
be
a
subject
of
discussion
and
dispute
no
doubt
the
idea
of
punishment
originated
in
the
feeling
of
resentment
and
hatred
and
vengeance
that
to
some
extent
at
least
is
incident
to
life
the
dog
is
hit
with
a
stick
and
turns
and
bites
the
stick
animals
repel
attack
and
fight
their
enemies
to
death
the
primitive
man
vented
his
hatred
and
vengeance
on
things
animate
and
inanimate
in
the
tribes
no
injury
was
satisfied
until
some
member
of
the
offending
tribe
was
killed
in
more
recent
times
family
feuds
have
followed
down
the
generations
and
were
not
forgotten
until
the
last
member
of
a
family
was
destroyed
biologically
anger
and
hatred
follow
fear
and
injury
and
punishment
follows
these
in
turn
individuals
communities
and
whole
peoples
hate
and
swear
vengeance
for
an
injury
real
or
fancied
punishments
even
to
the
extent
of
death
are
inflicted
where
there
can
be
no
possible
object
except
revenge
whether
the
victim
is
weak
or
strong
old
or
young
sane
or
insane
makes
no
difference
men
and
societies
react
to
injury
exactly
as
animals
react
that
vengeance
is
the
moving
purpose
of
punishment
is
abundantly
shown
by
the
religious
teachings
that
shape
the
ethical
ideas
of
the
western
world
the
old
testament
abounds
in
the
justification
of
vengeance
a
few
quotations
amply
show
the
biblical
approval
of
this
doctrine
whoso
sheddeth
man
blood
by
man
shall
his
blood
be
shed
genesis
no
expiation
can
be
made
for
the
land
for
the
blood
that
is
shed
therein
but
by
the
blood
of
him
that
shed
it
numbers
wherefore
should
the
nations
gentiles
say
where
is
their
the
jews
god
let
the
avenging
of
the
blood
of
thy
servants
which
is
shed
be
known
among
the
nations
in
our
sight
psalms
the
righteous
shall
rejoice
when
he
seeth
the
vengeance
he
shall
wash
his
feet
in
the
blood
of
the
wicked
so
that
men
shall
say
verily
there
is
a
reward
for
the
righteous
verily
there
is
a
god
that
judgeth
in
the
earth
psalms
and
i
god
will
execute
vengeance
in
anger
and
wrath
upon
the
nations
which
hearkened
not
micah
all
things
are
cleansed
with
blood
and
apart
from
the
shedding
of
blood
there
is
no
remission
hebrews
for
we
know
him
that
said
vengeance
belongeth
unto
me
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
living
god
hebrews
true
it
is
often
claimed
that
jesus
repudiated
the
doctrine
of
vengeance
the
passage
of
matthew
is
often
quoted
in
proof
of
this
assertion
ye
have
heard
that
it
hath
been
said
an
eye
for
an
eye
and
a
tooth
for
a
tooth
but
i
say
unto
you
that
ye
resist
not
evil
but
whosoever
shall
smite
thee
on
thy
right
cheek
turn
to
him
the
other
also
but
the
gospels
and
the
other
books
of
the
new
testament
show
plainly
that
was
not
laid
down
as
a
rule
for
the
guidance
of
mankind
but
only
as
a
policy
by
one
sect
of
the
jews
and
christians
to
save
themselves
from
the
romans
the
reason
for
the
doctrine
was
the
belief
that
resistance
was
hopeless
and
that
god
who
had
the
power
would
in
his
own
time
visit
on
the
oppressors
the
vengeance
that
the
jews
and
christians
were
too
weak
to
inflict
jesus
and
the
early
christians
knew
of
no
people
beyond
their
immediate
territory
and
they
did
not
appeal
to
mankind
as
a
whole
or
to
future
generations
the
early
christians
believed
in
judging
and
in
punishment
as
vengeance
the
same
as
the
jews
and
other
peoples
believed
in
it
see
matthew
matthew
matthew
they
believed
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
at
hand
that
the
coming
of
the
lord
was
imminent
that
some
of
that
generation
would
not
taste
death
and
that
god
would
punish
sinners
in
his
own
time
the
new
testament
is
replete
with
this
doctrine
which
was
stated
and
elaborated
in
the
revelations
of
st
peter
probably
this
document
was
composed
about
the
year
and
by
the
year
it
was
read
as
scripture
in
some
christian
communities
subsequently
it
disappeared
and
was
known
only
by
name
until
a
substantial
fragment
of
the
document
was
discovered
at
akhmim
in
egypt
in
the
year
a
portion
of
it
represents
a
scene
in
which
the
disciples
of
jesus
ask
him
to
show
them
the
state
of
the
righteous
dead
in
order
that
this
knowledge
may
be
used
to
encourage
people
to
accept
christianity
the
request
is
granted
and
the
disciples
are
shown
not
only
a
vision
of
the
delightful
abodes
of
the
righteous
but
also
a
vivid
picture
of
the
punishments
that
are
being
meted
out
to
the
wicked
it
is
interesting
to
note
how
the
punishments
are
devised
to
balance
in
truly
retributive
fashion
the
crimes
mentioned
it
is
this
type
of
tradition
that
furnished
dante
and
milton
the
basis
for
their
pictures
of
hell
the
following
is
the
more
interesting
portion
of
this
document
and
the
lord
showed
me
peter
a
very
great
country
outside
of
this
world
exceeding
bright
with
light
and
the
air
there
lighted
with
rays
of
the
sun
and
the
earth
itself
blooming
with
unfading
flowers
and
full
of
spices
and
plants
and
incorruptible
and
bearing
blessed
fruit
and
so
great
was
the
perfume
that
it
was
borne
thence
even
unto
us
and
the
dwellers
in
that
place
were
clad
in
the
raiment
of
shining
angels
and
their
raiment
was
like
unto
their
country
and
angels
hovered
about
them
there
and
the
glory
of
the
dwellers
there
was
equal
and
with
one
voice
they
sang
praises
alternately
to
the
lord
god
rejoicing
in
that
place
the
lord
said
to
us
this
is
the
place
of
your
brethren
the
righteous
and
over
against
that
place
i
saw
another
exceedingly
parched
and
it
was
the
place
of
punishment
and
those
who
were
being
punished
there
and
the
angels
who
punished
them
wore
dark
raiment
like
the
air
of
the
place
certain
persons
there
were
hanging
by
the
tongue
these
were
they
who
blaspheme
the
way
of
righteousness
and
under
them
lay
a
fire
whose
flames
tortured
them
also
there
was
a
great
lake
full
of
flaming
mire
in
which
were
certain
men
that
pervert
righteousness
and
tormenting
angels
afflicted
them
and
there
were
also
others
women
hanged
by
their
hair
over
that
mire
that
flamed
up
and
these
were
they
who
adorned
themselves
for
adultery
and
the
men
who
mingled
with
them
in
the
defilement
of
adultery
were
hanging
by
the
feet
with
their
heads
in
that
mire
and
they
exclaimed
in
a
loud
voice
we
did
not
believe
that
we
should
come
to
this
place
and
i
saw
the
murderers
and
their
accomplices
cast
into
a
certain
narrow
place
full
of
evil
snakes
where
these
evil
beasts
smote
them
while
they
turned
to
and
fro
in
that
punishment
and
worms
like
great
black
clouds
afflicted
them
and
the
souls
of
those
who
had
been
murdered
said
as
they
stood
and
looked
upon
the
punishment
of
their
murderers
o
god
just
is
thy
judgment
and
other
men
and
women
were
aflame
up
to
the
middle
and
were
cast
into
a
dark
place
and
were
beaten
by
evil
spirits
and
their
inwards
were
eaten
by
restless
worms
these
were
they
who
persecuted
the
righteous
and
delivered
them
up
to
the
authorities
and
over
against
these
were
other
men
and
women
gnawing
their
tongues
and
having
flaming
fire
in
their
mouths
these
were
false
witnesses
and
in
a
certain
other
place
there
were
pebbles
sharper
than
swords
or
any
needle
red
hot
and
women
and
men
in
tattered
and
filthy
raiment
rolled
about
on
them
in
punishment
these
were
the
rich
who
trusted
in
their
riches
and
had
no
pity
for
orphans
and
widows
and
despised
the
commandment
of
god
and
in
another
great
lake
full
of
boiling
pitch
and
blood
and
mire
stood
men
and
women
up
to
their
knees
these
were
the
usurers
and
those
who
take
compound
interest
the
noted
preacher
scholar
and
president
of
princeton
college
jonathan
edwards
in
his
famous
sermon
sinners
in
the
hands
of
an
angry
god
put
in
forcible
and
picturesque
language
the
religious
and
legal
view
of
punishment
as
vengeance
they
sinners
deserve
to
be
cast
into
hell
so
that
divine
justice
never
stands
in
the
way
it
makes
no
objection
against
god
using
his
power
at
any
moment
to
destroy
them
yea
on
the
contrary
justice
calls
aloud
for
an
infinite
punishment
on
their
sins
divine
justice
says
of
the
tree
that
brings
forth
such
grapes
of
sodom
cut
it
down
why
cumbereth
it
the
ground
luke
xiii
the
sword
of
divine
justice
is
every
moment
brandished
over
their
heads
and
it
is
nothing
but
the
hand
of
arbitrary
mercy
and
god
mere
will
that
holds
it
back
they
are
now
the
objects
of
that
very
same
anger
and
wrath
of
god
that
is
expressed
in
the
torments
of
hell
and
the
reason
why
they
do
not
go
down
to
hell
at
each
moment
is
not
because
god
in
whose
power
they
are
is
not
then
very
angry
with
them
as
angry
as
he
is
with
many
of
those
miserable
creatures
that
he
is
now
tormenting
in
hell
and
do
there
feel
and
bear
the
fierceness
of
his
wrath
yea
god
is
a
great
deal
more
angry
with
great
numbers
that
are
now
on
earth
yea
doubtless
with
many
that
are
now
in
this
congregation
that
it
may
be
are
at
ease
and
quiet
than
he
is
with
many
of
those
that
are
now
in
the
flames
of
hell
so
that
it
is
not
because
god
is
unmindful
of
their
wickedness
and
does
not
resent
it
that
he
does
not
let
loose
his
hand
and
cut
them
off
god
is
not
altogether
such
a
one
as
themselves
though
they
imagine
him
to
be
so
the
wrath
of
god
burns
against
them
their
damnation
does
not
slumber
the
pit
is
prepared
the
fire
is
made
ready
the
furnace
is
now
hot
ready
to
receive
them
the
flames
rage
and
glow
the
glittering
sword
is
whet
and
held
over
them
and
the
pit
hath
opened
her
mouth
under
them
the
god
that
holds
you
over
the
pit
of
hell
much
as
one
holds
a
spider
or
some
loathsome
insect
over
the
fire
abhors
you
and
is
dreadfully
provoked
his
wrath
towards
you
burns
like
fire
he
looks
upon
you
as
worthy
of
nothing
else
but
to
be
cast
into
the
fire
he
is
of
purer
eyes
than
to
bear
to
have
you
in
his
sight
you
are
ten
thousand
times
more
abominable
in
his
eyes
than
the
most
hateful
and
venomous
serpent
is
in
ours
you
have
offended
him
infinitely
more
than
ever
a
stubborn
rebel
did
his
prince
and
yet
it
is
nothing
but
his
hand
that
holds
you
from
falling
into
the
fire
every
moment
it
is
ascribed
to
nothing
else
that
you
did
not
go
to
hell
the
last
night
that
you
was
suffered
to
awake
again
in
this
world
after
you
closed
your
eyes
to
sleep
and
there
is
no
other
reason
to
be
given
why
you
have
not
dropped
into
hell
since
you
arose
in
the
morning
but
that
god
hand
has
held
you
up
there
is
no
other
reason
to
be
given
why
you
have
not
gone
to
hell
since
you
have
sat
here
in
the
house
of
god
provoking
his
pure
eyes
by
your
sinful
wicked
manner
of
attending
his
solemn
worship
yea
there
is
nothing
else
that
is
to
be
given
as
a
reason
why
you
do
not
this
very
moment
drop
down
into
hell
o
sinner
consider
the
fearful
danger
you
are
in
it
is
a
great
furnace
of
wrath
a
wide
and
bottomless
pit
full
of
the
fire
of
wrath
that
you
are
held
over
in
the
hand
of
that
god
whose
wrath
is
provoked
and
incensed
as
much
against
you
as
against
many
of
the
damned
in
hell
you
hang
by
a
slender
thread
with
the
flames
of
divine
wrath
flashing
about
it
and
ready
every
moment
to
singe
it
and
burn
it
asunder
and
you
have
no
interest
in
any
mediator
and
nothing
to
lay
hold
of
to
save
yourself
nothing
to
keep
off
the
flames
of
wrath
nothing
of
your
own
nothing
that
you
ever
have
done
nothing
that
you
can
do
to
induce
god
to
spare
you
one
moment
consider
this
you
that
are
here
present
that
yet
remain
in
an
unregenerate
state
that
god
will
execute
the
fierceness
of
his
anger
implies
that
he
will
inflict
wrath
without
any
pity
even
though
increasing
knowledge
may
have
somewhat
softened
the
language
of
vengeance
still
both
religion
and
the
law
have
found
their
chief
justification
for
punishment
in
the
doctrine
of
revenge
the
church
has
constantly
taught
from
the
first
that
god
would
punish
the
sinner
with
everlasting
torment
it
has
taught
that
all
are
bad
from
birth
and
can
be
saved
only
by
grace
the
punishment
to
be
suffered
was
as
terrible
as
man
mind
could
conceive
it
would
continue
infinitely
beyond
the
time
when
it
might
be
needed
for
correction
or
example
in
spite
of
a
few
humane
or
ministers
the
doctrine
persists
and
is
carefully
preserved
by
the
church
that
the
state
likewise
holds
fast
to
the
idea
of
vengeance
punishment
for
the
sake
of
suffering
is
just
as
evident
one
needs
only
to
note
the
force
and
degree
of
hatred
of
the
good
to
the
one
accused
of
crime
and
the
zeal
that
is
shown
for
a
man
hunt
to
realize
how
deeply
the
feeling
of
vengeance
is
planted
in
the
structure
of
man
the
truth
is
that
it
was
a
part
of
life
before
religion
and
political
institutions
were
evolved
still
most
people
are
now
ashamed
to
admit
that
punishment
is
based
on
vengeance
and
for
that
reason
various
excuses
and
apologies
have
been
offered
for
the
cruelty
that
goes
with
it
some
of
the
more
humane
or
squeamish
who
still
believe
in
punishment
contend
that
the
object
of
this
infliction
is
the
reformation
of
the
victim
this
of
course
can
not
be
urged
of
the
death
penalty
or
even
punishment
for
life
or
for
very
sentences
in
these
cases
there
is
neither
inducement
to
reform
nor
any
object
in
the
reformation
no
matter
how
thorough
the
reform
the
prisoner
never
goes
back
to
society
or
he
returns
after
there
is
no
longer
a
chance
for
him
to
be
of
use
to
the
world
or
to
enjoy
life
those
who
say
that
punishment
is
for
the
purpose
of
reforming
the
prisoner
are
not
familiar
with
human
psychology
the
prison
almost
invariably
tends
to
brutalize
men
and
breeds
bitterness
and
blank
despair
the
life
of
the
ordinary
prisoner
is
given
over
to
criticism
and
resentment
against
existing
things
especially
to
settled
hatred
of
those
who
are
responsible
for
his
punishment
only
a
few
and
these
are
the
weakest
ever
blame
themselves
for
their
situation
every
man
of
intelligence
can
trace
the
various
steps
that
led
him
to
the
prison
door
and
he
can
feel
if
he
does
not
understand
how
inevitable
each
step
was
the
number
of
repeaters
in
prison
shows
the
effect
of
this
kind
of
a
living
death
upon
the
inmates
to
be
branded
as
a
criminal
and
turned
out
in
the
world
again
leaves
one
weakened
in
the
struggle
of
life
and
handicapped
in
a
race
that
is
hard
enough
for
most
men
at
the
best
in
prison
and
after
leaving
prison
the
man
lives
in
a
world
of
his
own
a
world
where
all
moral
values
are
different
from
those
professed
by
the
jailer
and
society
in
general
the
great
influence
that
helps
to
keep
many
men
from
committing
crime
the
judgment
of
his
fellows
no
longer
deters
him
in
his
conduct
in
fact
every
person
who
understands
penal
institutions
no
matter
how
well
such
places
are
managed
knows
that
a
thousand
are
injured
or
utterly
destroyed
by
service
in
prison
where
one
is
helped
very
few
persons
seriously
believe
that
offenders
are
sent
to
prison
out
of
kindness
to
the
men
if
there
were
any
foundation
for
this
idea
each
prisoner
would
be
carefully
observed
and
when
he
was
fit
would
be
returned
to
the
world
not
even
the
parole
laws
which
provide
various
reasons
and
ways
for
shortening
sentences
ever
lay
down
the
rule
that
one
may
be
released
when
he
has
reformed
a
much
larger
class
of
people
offers
the
excuse
that
punishment
deters
from
crime
in
fact
this
idea
is
so
well
rooted
that
few
think
of
questioning
it
the
idea
that
punishment
deters
from
crime
does
not
mean
that
the
individual
prisoner
is
prevented
from
another
criminal
act
a
convicted
man
is
kept
in
jail
for
as
long
a
time
as
in
the
judgment
of
the
jury
the
court
or
the
parole
board
will
make
him
atone
or
at
least
suffer
sufficiently
for
the
offence
if
the
terms
are
not
long
enough
they
can
be
made
longer
the
idea
that
punishment
deters
means
that
unless
a
shall
be
punished
for
murder
then
b
will
kill
therefore
a
must
be
punished
not
for
his
own
sake
but
to
keep
b
from
crime
this
is
vicarious
punishment
which
can
hardly
appeal
to
one
who
is
either
just
or
humane
but
does
punishing
a
keep
b
from
the
commission
of
crime
it
certainly
does
not
make
a
more
social
man
of
b
if
it
operates
on
him
in
any
way
it
is
to
make
him
afraid
to
commit
crime
but
the
direct
result
of
scaring
b
is
not
to
keep
him
from
the
commission
of
crime
but
to
make
him
use
precautions
that
will
keep
him
safe
from
discovery
how
far
the
fear
of
detection
and
punishment
prevents
crime
is
of
course
purely
theoretical
and
can
not
be
settled
either
by
statistics
or
logic
one
thing
is
sure
that
if
b
is
kept
from
crime
it
is
through
fear
and
of
all
the
enemies
of
man
fear
is
the
one
which
causes
most
misery
and
pain
there
are
many
facts
that
show
that
the
punishment
of
one
does
not
deter
others
over
and
over
again
crimes
are
committed
by
the
young
especially
that
resemble
in
every
detail
a
previous
crime
which
has
received
large
publicity
through
the
newspapers
often
through
the
hanging
of
some
culprit
even
the
unthinking
public
always
clamoring
for
severe
penalties
does
not
believe
that
the
example
of
punishment
deters
the
public
forbids
the
exhibition
of
pictures
of
hangings
and
of
crimes
somehow
vaguely
and
dimly
as
most
men
see
everything
the
public
realizes
that
instead
of
punishments
preventing
crime
punishments
suggest
crime
in
the
olden
days
when
men
admitted
that
vengeance
and
punishment
went
together
they
were
at
least
more
logical
for
executions
were
in
the
open
light
of
day
so
all
might
see
and
be
deterred
but
this
sort
of
punishment
was
abolished
long
ago
now
executions
are
behind
doors
often
before
with
no
one
present
but
a
doctor
to
pronounce
the
victim
dead
a
preacher
to
try
to
save
his
soul
and
a
few
favored
guests
the
most
humane
individuals
advocate
suppressing
the
stories
in
the
newspapers
beyond
an
obituary
notice
for
the
deceased
and
forbidding
the
publication
of
the
details
of
the
crime
and
its
penalty
so
far
as
this
succeeds
it
is
a
confession
that
punishment
does
not
deter
but
instead
suggests
and
encourages
crime
the
idea
that
crime
is
prevented
by
punishment
if
believed
would
be
followed
by
requirements
that
the
young
should
visit
prisons
that
they
might
realize
the
consequences
of
crime
and
that
all
executions
should
be
public
and
should
be
performed
on
the
highest
hill
so
much
has
been
written
about
the
decrease
of
crime
that
follows
the
reduction
of
penalties
and
likewise
about
the
numerous
crimes
of
violence
which
generally
follow
public
hangings
that
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
recall
it
to
the
reader
the
fact
is
those
who
say
that
punishment
deters
have
no
confidence
in
their
own
statement
the
operations
of
the
human
mind
have
always
been
clouded
in
mystery
and
obscurity
the
effect
of
what
is
seen
and
heard
and
felt
has
never
been
certain
the
great
power
of
suggestion
especially
with
the
young
is
only
now
beginning
to
be
understood
many
things
can
be
done
by
suggestion
the
immature
brain
records
everything
that
the
senses
carry
to
it
through
the
nerves
these
records
through
lively
imagination
are
constantly
suggesting
and
urging
to
action
all
good
teachers
and
observing
parents
know
its
power
and
so
far
as
such
matters
can
be
proved
it
seems
clear
that
the
details
of
crime
and
punishment
reproduce
themselves
over
and
over
again
by
the
suggestion
carried
to
the
mind
especially
with
the
young
there
is
every
reason
to
think
that
suggestions
of
crime
will
affect
the
mind
as
much
as
suggestions
of
adventure
love
or
war
does
it
then
follow
that
no
one
shall
be
restrained
from
freedom
on
account
of
either
his
actions
or
his
nature
it
is
really
idle
to
ask
this
question
no
matter
what
one
may
think
of
the
criminal
and
his
responsibility
or
quite
regardless
of
whether
we
feel
pity
or
hatred
the
great
mass
of
the
community
will
not
suffer
one
who
has
little
to
interfere
seriously
and
directly
with
the
peace
and
happiness
of
the
community
in
which
he
lives
whether
by
the
action
of
the
law
or
by
vigilance
committees
some
men
will
not
be
allowed
to
be
at
large
doubtless
under
proper
treatment
and
environment
most
of
this
sort
of
conduct
would
disappear
but
for
many
years
to
come
it
will
remain
taking
away
the
liberty
of
another
has
only
one
justification
the
great
mass
of
people
in
any
community
must
and
will
act
for
it
needs
no
theories
to
justify
it
hatred
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
conduct
of
man
in
this
regard
is
only
like
that
of
the
animal
which
destroys
the
one
that
is
inimical
to
the
pack
or
herd
the
of
the
group
is
the
same
as
the
of
the
individual
both
the
group
and
the
man
will
save
their
lives
against
a
lunatic
or
any
other
menace
regardless
of
the
nature
of
the
menace
punishment
in
the
proper
meaning
of
the
term
can
not
be
justified
by
any
reasoning
punishment
really
means
the
infliction
of
pain
because
the
individual
has
wilfully
transgressed
its
supposed
justification
is
that
somehow
the
evil
done
is
atoned
for
or
made
good
or
balanced
if
the
author
of
the
evil
shall
suffer
pain
punishment
means
that
the
suffering
by
the
victim
is
the
end
and
it
does
not
mean
that
any
good
will
grow
out
of
the
suffering
it
seems
as
if
the
question
only
needed
to
be
stated
for
men
to
deny
the
validity
of
punishment
it
may
be
argued
that
whether
the
victim
is
punished
or
simply
restrained
can
make
no
difference
in
this
lies
the
whole
difference
between
scientific
and
humane
treatment
of
the
unfortunate
and
the
vengeful
punishments
that
have
always
been
visited
by
the
strong
upon
the
helpless
and
the
weak
society
restrains
the
imbecile
the
dangerously
insane
the
victims
of
deadly
contagious
diseases
all
these
are
restrained
without
any
feeling
of
hatred
but
with
pity
and
understanding
society
does
not
keep
one
of
these
persons
under
restraint
after
he
has
sufficiently
recovered
to
make
it
safe
to
return
him
to
the
community
neither
does
it
release
one
until
he
is
safe
it
uses
the
best
methods
for
his
treatment
that
may
make
him
fit
to
live
with
his
fellows
and
the
best
efforts
to
place
him
in
a
proper
environment
when
discharged
neither
does
any
disgrace
nor
humiliation
nor
handicap
attach
to
the
unfortunate
when
discharged
in
a
sense
the
attitude
of
mind
held
by
the
group
toward
the
criminal
is
the
whole
question
from
this
everything
follows
and
without
it
change
or
humanity
or
hope
is
not
possible
it
is
true
that
insane
asylums
homes
for
the
and
hospitals
are
not
what
they
should
be
nor
what
they
will
be
some
day
all
of
this
is
not
due
to
the
attitude
of
the
mind
of
the
public
but
is
due
to
the
method
of
administration
which
is
not
within
the
scope
of
this
book
if
justice
and
humanity
shall
ever
have
to
do
with
the
treatment
of
the
criminal
and
if
science
shall
ever
be
called
upon
in
this
one
of
the
most
serious
and
painful
questions
of
the
ages
it
is
necessary
first
that
the
public
shall
have
a
better
understanding
of
crime
and
criminals
iii
responsibility
for
crime
it
is
only
lately
that
we
are
beginning
to
find
out
anything
about
the
origin
and
nature
of
man
laws
have
come
down
to
us
from
old
customs
and
based
on
primitive
ideas
of
man
origin
capacity
and
responsibility
it
has
been
generally
assumed
that
man
was
created
different
from
all
the
rest
of
animal
life
that
man
alone
was
endowed
with
a
soul
and
with
the
power
to
tell
good
from
evil
that
in
the
beginning
man
was
perfect
but
yielded
to
temptation
and
since
then
has
been
the
subject
of
an
everlasting
contest
between
the
powers
of
light
and
the
powers
of
darkness
for
the
possession
of
his
soul
that
man
not
only
knew
good
from
evil
but
was
endowed
with
free
will
and
had
the
power
to
choose
between
good
and
evil
and
that
when
he
did
wrong
he
deliberately
chose
to
do
so
out
of
an
abandoned
and
malignant
heart
and
that
all
men
alike
were
endowed
with
this
power
and
all
alike
were
responsible
for
their
acts
the
old
indictments
charged
that
john
smith
being
a
wicked
malicious
and
evil
disposed
person
not
having
the
fear
of
god
before
his
eyes
but
being
moved
and
seduced
by
the
instigation
of
the
devil
etc
it
followed
of
course
that
john
smith
should
be
punished
or
made
to
suffer
for
he
had
purposely
brought
all
the
evil
on
himself
the
old
idea
is
still
the
foundation
of
the
world
judgment
of
men
in
court
and
out
of
course
this
idea
leaves
no
room
for
mercy
and
understanding
neither
does
it
leave
any
chance
to
give
the
criminal
the
proper
treatment
for
his
defects
which
might
permit
him
to
lead
a
normal
life
as
a
matter
of
fact
every
scientific
man
knows
that
the
origin
of
life
is
quite
different
from
this
that
the
whole
current
conception
of
the
individual
and
his
responsibility
is
a
gross
error
and
that
no
correct
judgments
can
be
based
on
the
old
foundation
that
no
sane
treatment
of
crime
can
follow
this
assumption
of
man
origin
and
nature
that
the
result
of
this
foundation
is
almost
infinite
injustice
and
cruelty
to
a
large
and
constantly
growing
number
of
men
and
women
and
that
it
tends
to
endless
injury
and
evil
to
society
the
conception
of
man
and
the
treatment
of
crime
and
criminals
by
the
courts
is
not
better
nor
more
scientific
than
was
the
doctors
treatment
of
physical
ailments
by
magic
incantations
and
sorcery
the
origin
and
development
of
all
animal
life
is
the
same
in
fact
the
development
of
plant
life
is
on
a
similar
pattern
the
origin
of
a
human
being
is
a
simple
cell
an
egg
this
cell
is
fertilized
and
through
growth
after
fertilization
begins
dividing
and
building
and
taking
on
the
form
and
semblance
of
a
human
being
all
children
have
the
same
origin
the
same
development
and
the
same
pattern
yet
no
two
are
alike
each
has
a
distinct
and
different
equipment
from
any
of
the
others
the
size
of
the
body
real
and
potential
the
size
and
fineness
of
the
brain
the
delicacy
and
sensitiveness
of
the
nervous
system
the
innate
instincts
upon
which
conduct
mainly
rests
the
emotions
which
control
action
and
which
flow
from
the
structure
in
short
the
degree
of
perfection
and
imperfection
of
the
machine
is
all
hidden
in
the
original
cell
no
person
now
thinks
of
questioning
the
fact
that
the
main
characteristics
of
the
human
being
as
of
every
other
animal
and
plant
are
hidden
in
the
germ
or
seed
from
which
it
sprang
the
laws
of
growth
and
development
which
govern
organic
matter
were
not
made
for
man
and
do
not
except
man
life
begins
with
the
cell
and
evolves
according
to
pattern
if
the
cell
is
that
of
a
human
being
it
will
be
black
or
white
male
or
female
tall
or
short
intelligent
or
stupid
sensitive
or
stolid
it
will
develop
a
large
or
a
small
brain
a
fine
one
or
a
poor
one
a
sensitive
nervous
system
or
a
defective
one
it
will
be
ruled
by
instincts
that
are
and
controlling
and
even
the
color
of
the
hair
and
eyes
are
in
the
pattern
the
whole
structure
potentially
is
in
the
original
cell
and
infinite
knowledge
could
tell
how
the
structure
would
respond
to
sensations
as
it
passed
through
life
it
is
obvious
that
the
kinds
and
differences
of
human
structures
are
infinite
it
is
no
more
possible
for
all
men
to
respond
equally
to
the
same
stimulus
than
it
is
for
all
machines
or
all
animals
to
respond
alike
it
is
apparent
that
not
one
of
the
structures
can
ever
work
perfectly
and
that
from
the
best
down
to
the
poorest
structures
are
infinite
degrees
of
perfection
even
down
to
the
machine
that
has
no
capacity
for
any
kind
of
work
no
ordinarily
intelligent
farmer
doubts
for
a
moment
that
all
of
this
is
true
in
the
breeding
of
stock
he
would
never
expect
the
same
results
from
various
breeds
of
cattle
or
even
from
all
cattle
of
the
same
breed
there
is
no
exception
to
the
rule
that
the
whole
life
with
every
tendency
is
potential
in
the
original
cell
an
acorn
will
invariably
produce
an
oak
tree
it
can
produce
no
other
tree
and
it
will
always
develop
true
to
its
own
pattern
the
tree
may
be
larger
or
smaller
more
or
less
symmetrical
stronger
or
weaker
but
always
true
to
the
general
pattern
of
the
oak
variations
will
be
certain
due
in
part
to
heredity
and
in
part
to
environment
that
the
baby
had
nothing
to
do
with
its
equipment
will
readily
be
admitted
by
everyone
the
child
is
born
with
a
brain
of
a
certain
size
and
fineness
it
is
born
with
a
nervous
system
made
up
of
an
infinite
number
of
fine
fibers
reaching
all
parts
of
the
body
with
fixed
stations
or
receivers
like
the
central
stations
of
a
telephone
system
and
with
a
grand
central
exchange
in
the
brain
if
one
can
imagine
all
of
the
telephone
wires
in
the
world
centered
in
one
station
he
may
have
some
sort
of
a
conception
of
the
separate
nerves
that
bring
impressions
to
the
brain
and
send
directions
out
from
it
which
together
make
up
the
nervous
system
of
man
none
of
these
systems
is
perfect
they
are
of
all
degrees
of
imperfection
down
to
the
utterly
useless
or
worse
than
useless
system
these
nerves
are
of
all
degrees
of
sensitiveness
and
accuracy
in
receiving
and
transmitting
messages
some
may
work
well
others
imperfectly
no
one
is
much
surprised
when
an
automobile
equipped
with
a
mechanism
much
simpler
than
the
nervous
system
refuses
to
respond
properly
the
child
is
born
without
knowledge
but
with
certain
tendencies
instincts
capacities
and
potential
strength
or
weakness
his
nervous
system
and
his
brain
may
be
good
or
bad
most
likely
neither
very
good
nor
very
bad
all
of
his
actions
both
as
a
child
and
as
a
man
are
induced
by
stimulation
from
without
he
feels
tastes
sees
hears
or
smells
some
object
and
his
nerves
carry
the
impression
to
his
brain
where
a
more
or
less
correct
registration
is
made
its
correctness
depends
largely
upon
the
perfection
of
the
nervous
system
and
the
fineness
of
the
material
on
which
the
registration
is
made
perfect
or
imperfect
the
child
begins
to
gather
knowledge
and
it
is
stored
in
this
way
to
the
end
of
his
days
he
receives
impressions
and
stores
them
in
the
same
manner
all
of
these
impressions
are
more
or
less
imperfectly
received
imperfectly
conveyed
and
imperfectly
registered
however
he
is
obliged
to
use
the
machine
he
has
not
only
does
the
machine
register
impressions
but
it
sends
out
directions
immediately
following
these
impressions
directions
to
the
organism
as
to
how
to
run
to
walk
to
fight
to
hide
to
eat
to
drink
or
to
make
any
other
response
that
the
particular
situation
calls
for
then
too
stimulated
by
these
impressions
certain
secretions
are
instantly
emptied
from
the
ductless
glands
into
the
blood
which
acting
like
fuel
in
an
engine
generate
more
power
in
the
machine
fill
it
with
anger
or
fear
and
prepare
it
to
respond
to
the
directions
to
fight
or
flee
or
to
any
type
of
action
incident
to
the
machine
it
is
only
within
a
few
years
that
biologists
have
had
any
idea
of
the
use
of
these
ductless
glands
or
of
their
importance
in
the
functions
of
life
very
often
these
ductless
glands
are
diseased
and
always
they
are
more
or
less
imperfect
but
in
whatever
condition
they
are
the
machine
responds
to
their
flow
the
impressions
are
more
or
less
awakened
under
stimulation
as
life
goes
on
these
stored
impressions
act
as
inhibitions
or
stimulations
to
action
as
the
case
may
be
these
form
the
material
for
comparisons
and
judgments
as
to
conduct
not
only
are
the
impressions
imperfect
and
the
record
imperfect
but
their
value
and
effect
depend
on
the
brain
which
compares
and
considers
the
impressions
from
all
this
mechanism
action
is
born
that
man
is
the
product
of
heredity
and
environment
and
that
he
acts
as
his
machine
responds
to
outside
stimuli
and
nothing
else
seem
amply
proven
by
the
evolution
and
history
of
man
but
quite
aside
from
this
logic
and
philosophy
must
lead
to
the
same
conclusions
this
is
not
a
universe
where
acts
result
from
chance
law
is
everywhere
supreme
every
process
of
nature
and
life
is
a
continuous
sequence
of
cause
and
effect
no
intelligent
person
would
ever
think
of
an
effect
in
the
physical
world
which
did
not
follow
a
cause
or
causes
it
has
taken
man
a
long
time
to
find
this
out
the
recurrence
of
the
seasons
the
and
harvest
the
common
phenomena
of
nature
were
once
supposed
to
be
outside
the
realm
of
cause
and
effect
and
due
to
the
whim
of
some
powerful
being
but
the
laws
of
matter
are
now
coming
to
be
understood
chance
accident
and
whim
have
been
banished
from
the
physical
world
the
acts
of
men
alone
are
supposed
to
be
outside
the
realm
of
law
there
is
a
cause
for
the
eternal
revolution
of
the
earth
around
the
sun
for
the
succession
of
and
harvest
for
growth
and
decay
but
not
for
the
thoughts
and
actions
of
man
all
the
teaching
of
the
world
is
based
on
the
theory
that
there
is
no
free
will
why
else
should
children
be
trained
with
so
much
care
why
should
they
be
taught
what
is
right
and
what
is
wrong
why
should
so
much
pains
be
taken
in
forming
habits
to
what
effect
is
the
storing
of
knowledge
in
the
brain
of
the
child
except
that
it
may
be
taught
to
avoid
the
wrong
and
to
do
the
right
man
every
action
is
caused
by
motive
whether
his
action
is
wise
or
unwise
the
motive
was
at
least
strong
enough
to
move
him
if
two
or
more
motives
pulled
in
opposite
directions
he
could
not
have
acted
from
the
weakest
but
must
have
obeyed
the
strongest
the
same
motives
applied
to
some
other
machine
might
have
produced
an
opposite
result
but
to
his
particular
structure
it
was
how
any
special
motive
will
affect
any
special
machine
must
depend
upon
the
relative
strength
of
the
motive
and
make
of
the
machine
it
is
for
this
reason
that
intelligent
people
have
always
taken
so
much
pains
to
fortify
the
machine
so
that
it
would
respond
to
what
they
believed
was
right
to
say
that
one
could
ever
act
from
the
weakest
motive
would
bring
chaos
and
chance
into
a
world
of
method
and
order
even
punishment
could
have
no
possible
effect
to
deter
the
criminal
after
release
or
to
influence
others
by
the
example
of
the
punishment
as
well
might
the
kernel
of
corn
refuse
to
grow
upward
to
the
sunlight
and
grow
downward
instead
before
any
progress
can
be
made
in
dealing
with
crime
the
world
must
fully
realize
that
crime
is
only
a
part
of
conduct
that
each
act
criminal
or
otherwise
follows
a
cause
that
given
the
same
conditions
the
same
result
will
follow
forever
and
ever
that
all
punishment
for
the
purpose
of
causing
suffering
or
growing
out
of
hatred
is
cruel
and
that
however
much
society
may
feel
the
need
of
confining
the
criminal
it
must
first
of
all
understand
that
the
act
had
an
cause
for
which
the
individual
was
in
no
way
responsible
and
must
find
the
cause
of
his
conduct
and
so
far
as
possible
remove
the
cause
iv
environment
the
acorn
will
inevitably
produce
the
oak
tree
and
it
will
grow
true
to
its
pattern
all
seeds
and
cells
will
do
likewise
still
if
the
acorn
is
planted
in
good
soil
where
it
is
properly
nourished
and
in
a
spot
where
it
is
sufficiently
sheltered
the
tree
will
be
more
likely
to
become
large
and
symmetrical
than
if
it
is
planted
in
poor
soil
or
in
an
exposed
spot
in
one
sense
heredity
is
the
seed
and
environment
the
soil
the
whole
structure
and
pattern
and
inherent
tendencies
and
potentiality
are
in
the
seed
and
can
not
be
changed
the
child
has
nothing
to
do
with
its
early
environment
during
the
period
when
impressions
sink
the
deepest
and
when
habits
are
formed
it
is
then
that
the
meaning
of
facts
is
interpreted
at
this
time
the
child
is
fashioned
by
the
teachings
and
environment
in
which
it
is
placed
as
the
child
receives
its
first
impressions
and
all
along
through
its
development
it
is
forming
habits
from
those
about
it
these
habits
come
to
be
strong
dominating
forces
in
its
life
very
few
people
if
any
can
trace
definite
views
of
conduct
or
thought
to
their
conscious
effort
but
these
are
born
of
their
structure
and
the
environment
that
formed
their
habits
after
birth
the
fact
that
an
individual
political
and
religious
faith
depends
almost
entirely
on
his
place
of
birth
and
early
youth
shows
the
strength
of
environment
in
forming
and
shaping
opinions
and
beliefs
as
the
child
grows
and
develops
it
is
influenced
by
all
that
surrounds
it
the
human
machine
moves
in
response
to
outside
stimulation
how
it
will
move
depends
upon
two
things
the
character
of
the
stimulant
and
the
machine
to
which
it
is
applied
no
two
machines
will
act
exactly
alike
from
the
same
stimulus
sometimes
they
act
in
diametrically
opposite
ways
for
instance
under
the
same
stimulation
one
may
run
and
another
may
fight
depending
perhaps
on
the
secretions
that
the
ductless
glands
empty
into
the
blood
no
machine
can
act
except
according
to
its
even
an
ignorant
person
who
finds
that
the
same
stimulant
produces
different
results
on
different
machines
would
know
that
the
structures
are
not
the
same
endless
discussions
have
been
devoted
to
the
relative
importance
of
heredity
and
environment
in
human
conduct
this
is
a
fruitless
task
in
a
sense
each
one
is
of
supreme
importance
in
the
outcome
of
a
life
it
is
obvious
that
some
structures
are
so
perfect
that
almost
no
environment
will
overcome
them
instances
of
strong
men
developing
out
of
poor
environment
are
not
rare
many
of
these
may
be
subject
to
doubt
as
to
whether
the
heredity
caused
the
strength
for
the
smallest
particle
of
luck
at
some
special
or
vital
time
may
make
all
the
difference
possible
in
the
outcome
of
a
life
while
some
heredities
withstand
a
poor
environment
others
are
so
poor
that
no
matter
how
good
the
environment
the
machine
can
not
survive
an
idiot
is
an
illustration
of
one
whom
environment
can
not
change
no
heredity
will
overcome
the
hardest
environment
the
old
saying
every
man
has
his
price
is
true
in
this
sense
that
every
machine
will
stand
just
so
much
and
no
more
some
machines
reach
the
breaking
point
soon
and
some
later
but
all
have
their
limit
most
people
have
a
heredity
that
is
not
the
best
nor
yet
the
worst
given
an
imperfect
machine
they
are
thrown
into
a
certain
environment
and
then
up
to
the
capacity
of
their
machines
the
outcome
depends
entirely
on
the
environment
given
an
environment
easy
enough
they
will
succeed
or
at
least
get
by
given
a
hard
environment
they
will
fail
or
go
down
tens
of
thousands
of
men
live
in
a
comparatively
easy
environment
and
pass
their
lives
as
useful
citizens
with
no
taint
of
criminality
to
their
names
who
under
a
hard
environment
would
be
found
in
prison
on
the
other
hand
perhaps
most
of
the
inmates
of
prisons
would
have
lived
as
respected
citizens
if
their
environment
had
not
been
so
hard
heredity
has
everything
to
do
with
making
the
machine
strong
and
capable
or
weak
and
useless
but
when
the
machine
is
made
and
thrown
on
the
world
in
its
imperfect
shape
environment
has
everything
to
do
in
determining
what
its
fate
shall
be
v
adjusting
heredity
and
environment
most
people
live
a
narrow
existence
perhaps
the
great
majority
of
men
and
women
find
their
safety
in
this
kind
of
a
life
the
adjustment
of
heredity
and
environment
is
not
an
easy
task
to
one
who
lives
an
unsheltered
life
the
ordinary
person
thrown
on
his
own
resources
is
poorly
equipped
for
existence
his
opinions
on
most
matters
are
not
sound
he
uses
poor
judgment
as
to
how
he
shall
spend
the
little
money
he
gets
he
is
generally
driven
by
debts
and
harassed
in
all
his
efforts
to
get
a
living
a
large
family
adds
to
his
trouble
and
his
existence
is
a
constant
struggle
with
what
to
him
is
an
almost
hopeless
fate
industrial
conditions
for
the
most
part
are
relentless
and
hard
the
poor
man
is
thrown
into
competition
with
his
fellows
for
work
he
may
get
along
when
work
is
easy
to
get
and
wages
are
good
but
in
dull
times
he
falls
behind
and
is
in
hopeless
trouble
his
life
is
a
long
hard
struggle
to
make
adjustments
to
his
environment
and
it
is
not
strange
that
he
goes
down
so
often
before
the
heavy
task
failure
to
make
proper
adjustments
directly
and
indirectly
often
means
prison
to
him
again
the
ordinary
and
especially
the
weak
man
is
hopelessly
puzzled
by
his
environment
it
must
never
be
overlooked
that
man
has
a
lowly
origin
the
marks
of
his
humble
birth
are
in
his
whole
structure
and
life
his
has
been
the
work
of
the
ages
he
is
a
late
development
of
a
life
that
knew
nothing
of
law
as
law
is
understood
today
his
ancestors
were
hungry
and
went
out
after
food
they
killed
their
prey
and
took
their
food
by
main
strength
whenever
they
had
the
power
they
were
subject
to
certain
customs
which
were
very
strict
but
which
were
few
and
did
not
seriously
complicate
life
they
knew
only
the
law
of
force
their
existence
was
simple
and
primal
and
they
were
governed
by
no
rights
except
such
simple
ones
as
were
made
by
might
and
custom
civilization
is
a
constant
of
limitations
around
heredity
a
persistent
growth
of
environmental
control
as
it
progresses
or
at
least
moves
along
this
structure
especially
the
legal
structure
is
built
by
the
more
intelligent
and
always
by
the
strong
men
it
is
always
shifting
and
moving
and
it
is
impossible
for
the
inferior
man
to
adjust
his
emotions
and
his
life
rapidly
to
the
changes
things
which
are
not
condemned
by
his
feelings
of
right
and
wrong
are
condemned
by
laws
that
meet
with
no
response
from
his
emotions
and
moral
ideas
to
him
at
least
these
are
not
different
from
the
things
that
are
done
by
others
with
impunity
and
without
rebuke
especially
is
this
true
of
the
rapidly
growing
class
of
property
laws
that
have
had
no
counterpart
in
the
early
history
of
man
this
list
has
grown
so
fast
that
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
a
large
class
of
men
to
find
in
their
feelings
any
response
to
many
of
these
criminal
statutes
the
social
restrictions
are
of
the
same
modern
growth
and
it
is
equally
impossible
to
feel
and
understand
them
what
we
call
civilization
has
moved
so
fast
that
the
structure
and
instincts
of
man
have
not
been
able
to
become
adjusted
to
it
the
structure
is
too
cumbersome
too
intense
too
hard
and
if
not
breaking
down
of
its
own
weight
it
is
at
least
destroying
thousands
who
can
not
adjust
themselves
to
its
changing
demands
not
only
are
the
effects
of
this
growing
body
of
social
and
legal
restrictions
shown
directly
by
their
constant
violation
generally
by
the
inferior
and
the
poor
but
indirectly
in
their
strain
on
the
nervous
system
by
the
irritation
and
impatience
that
they
generate
and
which
under
certain
conditions
cause
acts
of
violence

conduct
no
one
can
understand
conduct
without
knowing
something
of
the
psychology
of
human
action
first
of
all
it
must
be
understood
that
reason
which
so
many
have
idealized
and
placed
in
control
of
the
human
machine
has
little
to
do
with
the
actions
of
men
it
is
a
common
habit
with
most
men
to
find
fault
with
and
bewail
the
fact
that
human
beings
do
not
act
from
reason
however
much
the
truth
is
impressed
upon
us
we
never
seem
to
realize
that
the
basis
of
action
is
in
instinct
and
emotion
it
is
really
useless
to
quarrel
with
nature
whether
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
made
man
some
other
way
is
not
worth
discussing
he
has
been
evolved
in
a
certain
way
and
we
must
take
him
as
he
is
our
impatience
with
the
method
that
nature
has
provided
for
influencing
human
conduct
is
largely
due
to
our
idea
of
the
meaning
of
life
man
has
fancied
himself
in
a
position
in
the
animal
world
that
facts
of
life
and
nature
do
not
sustain
we
seem
to
feel
that
man
has
some
high
calling
that
he
should
make
something
of
himself
which
can
not
be
accomplished
that
he
should
form
some
sort
of
a
perfect
order
that
he
never
can
reach
in
short
that
man
has
a
purpose
and
a
mission
it
is
manifest
that
all
we
know
is
but
a
mite
compared
with
the
unknown
and
it
may
be
that
sometime
a
purpose
will
be
revealed
of
which
man
never
dreamed
still
from
all
that
we
can
see
and
understand
nature
has
but
one
desire
and
that
is
the
preservation
and
perpetuation
of
life
this
is
its
purpose
or
rather
its
strongest
urge
not
only
with
men
but
with
all
animal
life
sometimes
to
create
one
fish
a
million
eggs
are
spawned
nature
is
profligate
both
in
spawning
life
and
compassing
its
destruction
in
the
human
species
the
capacity
for
life
is
immeasurably
beyond
its
fruition
a
large
portion
of
those
who
are
born
die
an
early
death
and
that
human
life
shall
not
be
extinct
nature
plants
the
desire
deep
in
the
constitution
of
man
the
creation
of
life
comes
from
an
instinct
so
profound
and
absorbing
that
it
carries
a
train
of
evils
in
its
wake
many
are
overweighted
by
the
sex
instinct
to
their
positive
harm
nature
somehow
did
not
trust
such
a
fundamental
duty
as
the
preservation
of
the
race
to
reason
if
intellectual
processes
were
responsible
for
life
the
world
no
doubt
would
soon
be
bare
of
animate
things
neither
could
the
care
of
the
young
be
trusted
to
anything
but
the
instinct
that
causes
the
mother
to
forget
her
own
life
in
the
preservation
of
the
life
of
her
child
the
functions
of
body
on
which
life
is
founded
do
not
depend
upon
reason
the
heart
begins
to
beat
before
birth
it
continues
to
beat
until
the
end
of
life
the
reason
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
heart
performing
its
function
man
goes
to
sleep
at
night
confident
that
it
will
still
be
beating
in
the
morning
the
blood
circulates
in
the
veins
independent
of
the
thoughts
of
man
the
digestive
processes
go
on
whether
he
sleeps
or
is
awake
many
of
his
muscles
never
rest
from
birth
to
death
life
could
not
be
preserved
through
the
intellectual
processes
human
action
is
governed
largely
by
instinct
and
emotion
these
instincts
and
emotions
are
incident
to
every
living
machine
and
are
the
motor
forces
that
impel
the
organism
they
do
not
think
they
act
and
act
at
once
all
the
mind
can
do
is
to
place
some
restraint
on
such
instincts
and
emotions
through
experience
education
and
settled
habits
if
the
actions
are
never
inhibited
the
machine
will
tear
itself
to
pieces
if
too
easily
inhibited
it
will
do
no
work
it
is
manifest
that
the
perfect
machine
does
not
exist
man
is
moved
by
his
instinct
of
flight
and
his
emotion
of
fear
which
are
set
in
motion
by
apprehended
dangers
and
by
unaccustomed
sights
or
sounds
terror
sometimes
becomes
so
intense
that
it
prevents
flight
and
brings
convulsions
and
death
it
is
idle
to
reason
with
one
in
terror
it
is
idle
to
reason
with
a
mob
in
terror
or
a
nation
in
terror
one
might
as
well
expect
to
calm
a
tempestuous
sea
with
soft
words
the
instinct
of
repulsion
brings
hatred
and
dislike
and
combined
with
the
instinct
of
pugnacity
may
lead
to
crimes
of
violence
when
these
instincts
are
strong
enough
the
weak
and
superficial
barriers
can
not
stand
against
them
an
electrical
flash
showing
the
scaffold
with
the
noose
above
it
would
have
no
force
to
stop
an
instinct
and
emotion
fully
aroused
through
seeing
feeling
hearing
tasting
or
smelling
some
instinct
is
called
into
action
many
times
several
conflicting
instincts
are
aroused
the
man
is
like
a
tree
bent
back
and
forth
by
the
storm
if
the
storm
is
hard
enough
sooner
or
later
it
will
break
which
way
the
tree
falls
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
consciousness
of
the
tree
but
has
to
do
only
with
the
direction
of
the
prevailing
and
controlling
force
the
instinct
of
gregariousness
draws
animals
or
men
together
into
communities
and
close
relations
this
is
one
of
the
strongest
instincts
and
not
only
preserves
life
but
is
fundamental
to
those
human
associations
that
are
the
basis
of
civilization
except
for
this
animals
would
live
a
lonely
life
and
probably
perish
from
the
earth
through
this
instinct
man
builds
his
villages
and
cities
and
organizes
his
states
and
nations
with
the
gregarious
instinct
and
the
parental
instinct
drawing
men
together
and
the
instincts
and
emotions
of
flight
fear
and
pugnacity
repelling
and
pushing
them
apart
conflict
is
inevitable
all
that
can
be
done
is
to
create
and
cultivate
as
strong
habits
customs
and
laws
as
possible
to
stand
against
the
power
of
instinct
and
emotion
in
time
of
need
and
to
remove
the
main
inciting
causes
so
far
as
man
has
the
intelligence
and
power
to
remove
them
it
is
evident
that
this
can
never
be
complete
there
are
too
many
weak
machines
too
many
defective
nervous
systems
too
many
badly
organized
brains
accidents
are
inevitable
and
some
accidents
are
called
crimes
when
the
accident
is
international
or
it
means
war
those
who
believe
that
there
is
any
power
to
stop
all
the
harmful
manifestations
of
man
instincts
either
individually
or
do
not
understand
the
fundamental
nature
of
man
many
and
probably
all
instincts
work
both
for
good
and
ill
flight
pugnacity
repulsion
sex
all
are
or
as
the
case
may
be
a
certain
degree
of
excitation
brings
life
and
pleasure
a
stronger
or
weaker
may
bring
calamity
and
death
the
parental
instinct
with
the
instinct
of
reproduction
is
fundamental
to
life
it
is
the
basis
of
tenderness
and
sympathy
and
is
likewise
the
foundation
of
jealousy
and
often
of
hatred
and
pugnacity
at
one
time
it
may
mean
the
deepest
and
most
abiding
pleasures
of
life
and
at
another
it
may
bring
death
life
can
not
exist
without
it
and
yet
that
it
may
persist
nature
seriously
overloads
many
machines
with
disastrous
results
history
is
replete
with
the
helplessness
of
reason
and
judgment
in
dealing
with
these
emotions
neither
when
they
act
for
good
nor
for
ill
can
reason
and
judgment
have
the
slightest
weight
when
these
instincts
and
emotions
are
stirred
to
the
depths
the
emotion
to
acquire
and
keep
property
is
very
strong
and
perhaps
at
the
base
of
the
deep
desire
for
wealth
this
emotion
is
probably
of
a
comparatively
late
growth
but
today
it
seems
to
have
taken
its
place
as
one
of
the
strongest
that
move
men
this
emotion
like
all
others
prompts
man
to
get
what
he
wants
it
of
course
does
not
suggest
the
way
but
is
simply
an
urge
to
acquire
and
possess
it
is
modified
and
hedged
about
by
customs
and
habits
but
like
all
instincts
its
strength
is
always
seeking
ways
to
accomplish
results
regardless
of
the
rules
laid
down
and
thus
urging
their
violation
with
weak
machines
and
imperfect
systems
where
not
only
are
the
restrictions
imperfect
the
habits
not
well
defined
but
where
it
is
impossible
to
satisfy
the
instinct
under
the
rules
laid
down
there
can
be
but
one
result
a
large
number
will
take
property
wherever
and
however
they
can
get
it
the
instinct
for
acquisition
is
so
strong
that
men
are
constantly
contriving
new
and
improved
methods
for
getting
property
often
the
new
methods
come
under
restraint
of
the
law
the
enactment
of
the
law
does
not
give
man
the
feeling
that
a
thing
is
wrong
which
before
was
right
and
many
continue
their
ways
of
getting
property
regardless
of
the
law
the
instinct
is
too
strong
the
needs
too
great
and
the
barriers
too
weak
instincts
are
primal
to
man
he
has
inherited
them
from
the
animal
world
their
strength
and
weakness
depend
on
the
of
the
machine
some
are
very
strong
and
some
abnormally
weak
and
there
are
no
two
machines
that
emphasize
or
repress
the
same
instincts
to
the
same
degree
one
need
but
look
at
his
family
and
neighbors
to
see
the
various
manifestations
of
these
instincts
some
are
quarrelsome
and
combative
and
will
fight
on
the
slightest
provocation
others
are
distinctively
social
the
gregarious
instinct
is
pronounced
in
many
people
these
are
always
seen
in
company
and
can
not
be
alone
they
readily
adapt
themselves
to
any
sort
of
associations
others
are
solitary
they
choose
to
be
alone
they
shrink
from
and
avoid
the
society
of
others
in
some
the
instinct
at
the
basis
of
sex
association
is
they
like
children
they
are
generally
sympathetic
and
emotional
and
the
strength
of
the
instinct
often
leads
them
to
excesses
others
are
entirely
lacking
in
this
instinct
they
neither
care
for
children
nor
want
them
they
habitually
avoid
association
with
the
other
sex
the
difference
is
constituent
in
the
elements
that
make
up
the
machine
everyone
is
familiar
with
the
varying
strength
and
weakness
of
the
instincts
of
getting
and
hoarding
as
shown
by
his
neighbors
and
acquaintances
some
seem
to
have
no
ambition
or
thought
for
getting
or
keeping
money
some
can
get
it
but
can
not
keep
it
some
have
in
them
from
childhood
the
instinct
for
getting
the
better
of
every
trade
for
hoarding
what
they
get
and
accumulating
property
all
their
lives
in
this
as
in
all
other
respects
no
two
individuals
are
alike
history
is
filled
with
examples
of
men
who
had
the
instinctive
power
of
getting
money
combined
with
the
instinct
for
keeping
it
their
names
are
familiar
all
the
way
from
midas
and
croesus
down
to
the
prominent
captains
of
industry
today
it
is
common
for
them
and
their
adherents
who
criticise
new
schemes
of
social
organization
to
remark
with
the
greatest
assurance
that
before
wealth
can
be
equal
brains
must
be
equal
the
truth
is
that
brains
have
little
to
do
with
either
the
making
or
accumulating
of
money
this
depends
mainly
like
all
other
activities
on
the
strength
or
weakness
of
the
instincts
involved
brain
capacity
can
not
be
measured
by
his
bank
account
any
more
than
by
the
strength
of
his
body
or
the
color
of
his
hair
his
bank
account
simply
shows
his
innate
tendencies
there
is
no
doubt
that
brain
capacity
as
well
as
physical
perfection
adds
to
power
but
it
is
the
instinct
that
determines
the
tendency
and
strength
of
the
activity
to
say
that
the
one
who
gets
money
the
most
easily
and
keeps
it
the
most
safely
has
the
best
brain
is
no
more
reasonable
than
to
say
that
the
foxhound
is
more
intelligent
than
the
because
it
can
run
faster
nature
formed
one
for
running
and
the
other
for
holding
on
the
brain
power
is
not
involved
there
are
manifold
ways
of
gratifying
all
these
instincts
the
desire
for
property
calls
simply
for
getting
it
and
keeping
it
it
does
not
involve
the
method
to
be
used
the
way
is
determined
by
other
faculties
by
education
by
opportunities
by
the
strength
and
weakness
of
inhibitions
it
does
not
follow
that
all
legal
ways
are
morally
right
and
all
illegal
ones
morally
wrong
society
in
its
development
has
established
certain
ways
in
which
it
may
be
done
these
ways
are
easy
for
some
they
are
hard
for
others
and
for
many
quite
impossible
still
the
instinct
for
getting
is
always
present
leading
and
urging
to
acquire
and
to
keep
endless
are
the
ways
that
men
have
contrived
to
gratify
this
instinct
if
perchance
a
law
stands
in
the
way
means
are
always
sought
to
get
around
the
law
every
desire
is
always
seeking
its
own
gratification
or
satisfaction
this
means
life
most
men
believe
that
the
way
they
adopt
for
getting
money
or
gratifying
other
instincts
is
really
no
worse
than
some
other
person
way
the
man
who
uses
the
confidence
game
contends
with
great
assurance
that
his
methods
are
like
other
business
methods
that
all
men
are
using
every
means
to
get
the
largest
return
for
the
least
effort
and
one
way
is
no
better
than
another
a
considerable
portion
of
society
has
always
supported
him
in
these
ideas
the
law
is
full
of
shadowy
lines
which
divide
legal
acquisition
from
the
illegal
some
of
which
are
so
fine
that
no
one
can
see
more
than
a
technical
difference
for
instance
under
an
indictment
for
obtaining
money
by
false
pretenses
one
may
make
all
sorts
of
statements
as
to
the
quality
value
style
and
desirability
of
the
article
sold
if
he
does
not
make
a
specific
statement
of
a
fact
regarding
the
material
contained
in
them
or
the
amount
number
quality
or
the
like
he
may
lie
but
to
be
safe
he
must
know
the
kind
of
lie
the
law
permits
many
lies
pass
as
puffing
goods
and
are
within
the
pale
a
trader
is
not
expected
to
tell
the
truth
what
he
can
and
can
not
say
may
be
determined
only
by
a
careful
examination
of
the
law
and
not
always
then
infinite
are
the
reasons
men
give
for
doing
the
things
that
their
instincts
bid
them
do
all
depends
upon
the
strength
of
the
instinct
and
the
character
of
the
machine
the
restrictions
and
habits
formed
and
many
other
factors
of
which
the
man
knows
nothing
in
fact
all
depends
upon
his
endowment
and
the
outside
forces
that
move
to
action
and
for
none
of
these
is
he
in
any
way
to
be
praised
or
blamed
society
seems
to
be
almost
oblivious
to
the
emotional
life
of
man
the
great
masses
of
men
have
no
capacity
or
chance
to
prepare
a
proper
environment
in
the
intense
commercialism
and
mad
rush
of
today
the
laws
of
trade
and
commerce
give
most
men
food
clothing
and
shelter
but
nothing
more
there
is
no
beauty
in
their
homes
or
surroundings
no
music
or
art
no
adventure
or
speculation
existence
is
a
dead
thing
a
dreary
round
to
many
such
people
crime
furnishes
the
only
chance
for
adventure
take
away
emotions
and
life
is
hopelessly
dull
and
commonplace
the
emotions
of
men
must
be
fed
just
as
the
body
must
be
fed
to
many
religion
has
furnished
this
emotional
life
churches
have
provided
some
art
and
some
music
but
aside
from
the
catholic
church
almost
none
of
this
is
for
the
poor
to
many
if
not
most
people
religion
can
not
take
the
place
of
joy
dogma
and
creed
deaden
and
can
not
appeal
to
the
reason
of
man
still
they
have
furnished
a
large
part
of
the
emotional
life
to
great
masses
of
men
without
which
existence
would
hold
no
hope
or
joy
but
this
is
not
enough
to
fill
most
lives
the
element
of
joy
is
largely
lacking
to
many
it
makes
no
appeal
although
music
and
art
and
beauty
do
in
no
country
has
society
so
utterly
neglected
and
ignored
the
emotional
side
of
man
as
in
america
this
has
led
many
men
to
a
life
of
adventure
that
for
them
has
been
possible
only
in
crime
many
others
found
this
life
in
the
saloon
mixed
with
influences
not
conducive
to
a
normal
life
the
closing
of
the
saloons
has
added
to
the
already
serious
need
of
providing
for
the
innate
feelings
of
men
this
is
all
the
more
important
for
america
as
a
large
part
of
our
population
has
come
from
lands
where
beauty
and
art
and
music
have
for
generations
been
made
a
part
of
the
common
life
of
all
vii
the
criminal
those
who
have
had
no
experience
in
the
courts
and
no
knowledge
of
what
is
known
as
the
criminal
class
have
a
general
idea
that
a
criminal
is
not
like
other
men
the
people
they
know
are
conventional
believers
in
the
state
and
the
church
and
all
social
customs
and
relations
they
have
strict
ideas
of
property
rights
and
regard
the
law
as
sacred
true
they
have
no
more
acquaintance
with
and
politicians
in
general
than
with
the
criminal
class
which
of
course
is
one
reason
why
they
have
such
unbounded
confidence
in
the
law
such
persons
are
surprised
and
shocked
when
some
member
of
the
family
or
some
friend
is
entangled
in
the
courts
and
generally
regard
it
as
a
catastrophe
that
has
come
upon
him
by
accident
or
a
terrible
mistake
as
a
rule
they
do
all
in
their
power
to
help
him
whether
he
is
acquitted
or
convicted
they
never
think
that
he
and
everyone
else
they
know
is
not
materially
different
from
the
ordinary
criminal
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
potential
criminal
is
in
every
man
and
no
one
was
ever
so
abandoned
that
some
friend
would
not
plead
for
him
or
that
some
one
who
knew
him
would
not
testify
to
his
good
deeds
the
criminal
is
not
hard
to
understand
he
is
one
who
from
inherited
defects
or
from
great
misfortune
or
especially
hard
circumstances
is
not
able
to
make
the
necessary
adjustments
to
fit
him
to
his
environment
seldom
is
he
a
man
of
average
intelligence
unless
he
belongs
to
a
certain
class
that
will
be
discussed
later
almost
always
he
is
below
the
normal
of
intelligence
and
in
perhaps
half
of
the
cases
very
much
below
nearly
always
he
is
a
person
of
practically
no
education
and
no
property
one
who
has
given
attention
to
the
subject
of
crime
knows
exactly
where
the
criminal
comes
from
and
how
he
will
develop
the
crimes
of
violence
and
murder
and
the
lesser
crimes
against
property
practically
all
come
from
those
who
have
been
reared
in
the
poor
and
congested
districts
of
cities
and
large
villages
the
robbers
burglars
pickpockets
and
thieves
are
from
these
surroundings
in
a
broad
sense
some
criminals
are
born
and
some
are
made
nearly
all
of
them
are
both
born
and
made
this
does
not
mean
that
criminality
can
be
inherited
or
even
that
there
is
a
criminal
type
it
means
that
with
certain
physical
and
mental
imperfections
and
with
certain
environment
the
criminal
will
be
the
result
seldom
does
one
begin
a
criminal
life
as
a
man
the
origin
of
the
typical
criminal
is
an
imperfect
child
suffering
from
some
defect
usually
he
was
born
with
a
weak
intellect
or
an
unstable
nervous
system
he
comes
from
poor
parents
often
one
or
both
of
these
died
or
met
misfortune
while
he
was
young
he
comes
from
the
crowded
part
of
a
poor
district
he
has
had
little
chance
to
go
to
school
and
could
not
have
been
a
scholar
no
matter
how
regularly
he
attended
school
some
useful
things
he
could
have
learned
had
society
furnished
the
right
teachers
surroundings
and
opportunities
to
make
the
most
of
an
imperfect
child
early
in
life
he
does
some
desultory
work
in
casual
occupations
this
of
course
is
not
steady
but
he
picks
up
what
he
can
and
keeps
the
job
for
a
short
time
sometimes
quitting
work
because
he
is
discharged
and
sometimes
because
like
most
boys
and
men
he
does
not
like
to
work
his
playground
is
the
street
the
railroad
yards
or
vacant
lots
too
small
for
real
play
and
fit
only
for
a
loafing
place
for
boys
like
himself
these
gather
nightly
and
talk
of
the
incidents
that
interest
most
people
mainly
the
abnormal
things
of
life
and
generally
the
crimes
that
the
newspapers
make
so
prominent
to
satisfy
the
public
demand
he
learns
to
go
into
vacant
buildings
steals
the
plumbing
and
he
early
learns
where
to
sell
it
from
this
it
is
only
a
short
step
to
visiting
occupied
buildings
at
night
in
this
way
he
learns
to
be
a
burglar
as
other
boys
learn
to
play
baseball
or
golf
naturally
he
has
no
strong
sense
of
property
rights
he
has
always
had
a
hard
time
to
get
enough
to
eat
and
wear
and
he
has
grown
up
unconsciously
to
see
the
inequality
of
distribution
and
to
believe
that
it
is
not
fair
and
that
there
is
little
or
no
justice
in
the
world
as
a
child
he
learned
to
get
things
the
best
way
he
could
and
to
think
nothing
about
it
in
short
his
life
like
all
other
lives
moves
along
the
lines
of
least
resistance
he
soon
comes
to
feel
that
the
police
are
his
natural
enemies
and
his
chief
business
is
to
keep
from
getting
caught
inevitably
he
is
brought
into
the
juvenile
court
he
may
be
reprimanded
at
first
he
comes
again
and
is
placed
on
probation
the
next
time
he
goes
to
a
juvenile
prison
where
he
can
learn
all
the
things
he
has
not
found
out
before
he
is
known
to
the
police
known
to
the
court
known
to
the
neighbors
his
status
is
fixed
when
released
from
prison
he
takes
his
old
heredity
back
into
his
old
environment
it
is
the
easiest
to
him
for
he
has
learned
to
make
his
adjustments
to
this
environment
from
fifteen
to
years
of
age
he
has
the
added
burden
of
adolescence
the
trying
time
in
a
boy
life
when
sex
feelings
are
developing
when
he
is
passing
from
childhood
to
manhood
this
is
a
very
difficult
time
at
best
to
the
type
of
boy
from
which
a
criminal
grows
he
meets
it
without
preparation
or
instruction
what
he
knows
he
learns
from
others
like
himself
he
gets
weird
fantastic
neurotic
ideas
which
only
add
to
his
natural
wonderment
every
person
who
has
not
inherited
property
must
live
by
some
trade
or
calling
very
few
people
in
jail
or
out
choose
their
profession
even
if
one
selects
his
profession
it
does
not
follow
that
he
has
chosen
the
calling
for
which
he
is
best
adapted
so
far
as
a
person
can
and
does
follow
his
desires
he
generally
means
to
choose
the
calling
which
will
bring
him
the
greatest
amount
of
return
for
the
least
exertion
he
may
have
strong
inclinations
in
certain
directions
as
for
instance
to
paint
or
to
write
or
to
investigate
or
to
philosophize
but
as
a
rule
he
does
not
make
his
living
from
following
these
ambitions
if
he
does
it
is
generally
a
poor
living
but
usually
his
aim
is
to
make
money
at
something
else
so
that
he
can
give
free
rein
to
his
real
ambitions
most
men
start
to
make
a
living
as
boys
from
the
ages
of
fifteen
to
eighteen
they
have
no
idea
of
what
they
ought
to
do
or
even
of
what
they
want
to
do
usually
so
far
as
they
have
an
ambition
it
is
to
do
something
more
or
less
spectacular
that
seems
to
have
an
element
of
adventure
and
not
too
disagreeable
or
hard
something
like
the
work
of
a
policeman
a
chauffeur
or
an
employee
in
a
garage
still
first
and
last
most
boys
and
most
men
have
no
opportunity
for
choosing
an
occupation
in
fact
the
boy
is
told
that
he
is
a
man
and
must
get
a
job
long
before
he
knows
that
he
is
a
man
or
begins
to
feel
responsibilities
while
he
still
has
all
the
emotions
and
dreams
of
a
boy
when
he
is
told
he
must
go
to
work
he
looks
for
a
job
he
does
not
wait
until
he
can
find
the
one
that
fits
him
he
can
not
afford
to
wait
and
if
he
could
he
does
not
know
what
job
would
fit
he
takes
automatically
the
first
place
he
can
get
hoping
to
find
a
better
one
which
generally
means
an
easier
one
before
very
long
it
is
hard
for
a
boy
to
stick
to
work
too
many
things
are
calling
him
away
every
instinct
and
emotion
is
urging
him
to
play
new
feelings
and
desires
are
coaxing
him
from
work
his
companions
and
the
boy
life
in
which
he
has
a
place
urge
him
to
leave
his
task
usually
he
keeps
his
job
no
longer
than
he
can
help
and
later
looks
for
something
else
the
chances
are
great
that
he
will
never
find
what
he
wants
that
he
has
not
had
the
preparation
or
training
for
a
successful
workingman
career
whatever
that
might
be
he
is
a
doer
of
odd
jobs
and
of
poorly
paid
work
all
his
life
he
must
have
some
calling
and
takes
the
easiest
one
which
is
often
a
life
of
crime
from
this
start
comes
the
professional
criminal
he
may
make
a
business
of
picking
pockets
if
this
comes
to
be
his
trade
it
is
very
hard
for
him
to
give
it
up
there
is
so
strong
an
element
of
chance
he
never
knows
what
a
pocket
will
contain
it
gratifies
a
spirit
of
adventure
then
it
is
easy
the
wages
are
much
greater
than
he
could
get
in
any
other
calling
the
hours
are
short
and
it
never
interferes
with
his
amusements
it
is
not
so
dangerous
as
being
a
burglar
or
a
switchman
for
he
can
find
an
excuse
for
jostling
one
in
the
or
in
a
crowd
and
thus
reaching
into
a
pocket
the
burglar
is
not
so
apt
to
be
a
professional
his
is
a
bolder
and
more
hazardous
trade
if
he
is
caught
he
is
taken
from
his
occupation
for
a
longer
time
the
great
hazard
involved
in
this
trade
and
also
the
physical
strength
and
fitness
of
those
who
follow
it
lead
to
its
abandonment
more
frequently
than
is
the
case
with
a
pickpocket
or
a
petty
thief
robbery
is
seldom
a
profession
it
is
usually
the
crime
of
the
young
and
venturesome
and
almost
surely
leads
to
early
disaster
murder
of
course
is
never
a
profession
in
a
broad
way
it
is
the
result
of
accident
or
passion
or
of
relations
which
are
too
hard
to
endure
in
prison
and
out
i
have
talked
with
scores
of
these
men
and
boys
i
am
sure
they
rarely
tried
to
deceive
me
i
have
very
seldom
seen
one
who
felt
that
he
had
done
wrong
or
had
any
thought
of
what
the
world
calls
reformation
a
very
few
have
used
the
current
language
of
those
who
talk
of
reform
but
generally
they
were
the
weakest
and
most
hopeless
of
the
lot
and
usually
adopted
this
attitude
to
deceive
in
almost
every
instance
where
you
meet
any
sign
of
intelligence
excuses
and
explanations
are
freely
made
and
these
explanations
fully
justify
their
points
of
view
often
too
they
tell
you
in
sincerity
that
they
believe
their
way
of
life
is
too
hard
and
does
not
pay
that
while
they
can
not
see
how
they
could
have
done
any
differently
in
the
past
they
believe
their
experience
has
taught
them
to
stick
by
the
rules
of
the
game
the
boy
delinquent
grows
naturally
and
almost
inevitably
into
the
man
criminal
he
has
generally
never
learned
a
trade
no
habits
have
been
formed
in
his
youth
to
keep
him
from
crime
a
life
of
crime
is
the
only
one
open
to
him
and
for
this
life
he
has
had
ample
experience
inclination
and
opportunity
then
too
for
this
kind
of
young
man
the
life
of
a
criminal
has
a
strong
appeal
life
without
opportunity
and
without
a
gambler
chance
to
win
a
considerable
prize
is
not
attractive
to
anyone
the
conventional
man
who
devotes
his
life
to
business
or
to
a
profession
always
has
before
him
the
prizes
of
success
to
some
honor
and
glory
and
to
most
of
them
wealth
imagine
the
number
of
lawyers
doctors
and
business
men
who
could
stick
to
a
narrow
path
if
they
knew
that
life
offered
no
opportunity
but
drudgery
and
poverty
nearly
all
of
these
look
forward
to
the
prizes
of
success
most
of
them
expect
success
and
many
get
it
for
the
man
that
i
have
described
a
life
of
toil
offers
no
chance
of
success
his
capacity
education
and
environment
deny
him
the
gambler
chance
of
a
prize
as
an
honest
man
he
may
raise
a
family
always
be
in
debt
live
a
life
of
poverty
and
hardship
and
see
nothing
ahead
but
drudgery
and
defeat
this
is
why
so
many
mediocre
men
are
found
in
the
mountains
and
oil
fields
prospecting
for
hidden
wealth
with
the
chance
of
a
fortune
just
before
them
and
no
other
opportunity
to
win
they
spend
their
lives
without
a
family
or
home
urged
on
by
the
hope
of
luck
the
man
grown
from
boyhood
into
ways
of
vice
and
crime
sees
this
hope
and
this
hope
only
to
make
a
strike
he
has
no
strong
convictions
and
no
habits
to
hold
him
back
the
fear
of
the
law
only
means
greater
caution
and
after
all
he
has
nothing
to
lose
in
his
world
arrest
and
conviction
do
not
mean
loss
of
caste
they
mean
only
bad
luck
with
large
numbers
of
men
crime
becomes
a
trade
it
grows
to
be
a
business
as
naturally
as
any
other
calling
comes
to
be
a
trade
there
are
other
criminals
who
do
not
come
from
the
class
i
have
described
but
the
habitual
visitor
to
criminal
courts
knows
that
they
are
very
few
of
the
others
some
are
born
of
parents
who
could
care
for
them
and
have
done
their
best
and
yet
in
spite
of
this
they
have
repeatedly
been
entangled
in
the
law
these
are
often
the
only
ones
of
a
large
family
who
have
not
lived
according
to
the
rules
of
the
game
they
are
different
from
the
other
members
of
the
family
for
the
most
part
they
have
some
specific
congenital
defect
or
an
unstable
system
that
prevents
the
correct
registration
of
the
experiences
that
produce
safe
habits
or
makes
them
unable
to
withstand
temptation
or
suggestion
everyone
knows
how
easy
it
is
especially
for
children
to
react
to
suggestion
the
whole
life
of
a
child
is
a
response
to
suggestion
this
is
about
all
there
is
to
education
even
older
men
constantly
and
readily
yield
to
suggestion
the
results
gained
by
quack
doctors
agents
promoters
and
dealers
in
oil
stocks
mining
stocks
and
an
endless
number
of
other
stocks
show
that
the
right
kind
of
suggestion
is
bound
to
produce
results
the
dressing
of
the
windows
of
department
stores
and
the
writing
of
catchy
advertisements
are
a
constant
recognition
of
the
power
of
suggestion
so
well
known
is
this
weakness
of
human
character
that
schools
of
salesmanship
are
regularly
organized
and
promoted
to
teach
the
art
of
getting
victims
to
part
with
money
for
things
they
do
not
want
or
need
every
person
does
everything
in
his
power
to
educate
the
child
he
is
ever
watchful
through
the
child
youth
and
early
manhood
to
equip
him
with
the
capacity
to
make
a
living
he
seeks
to
build
up
around
him
and
within
him
the
strongest
kind
of
habits
and
beliefs
he
carefully
teaches
the
child
that
the
only
way
to
live
is
to
observe
all
the
rules
laid
down
by
experience
and
custom
so
that
he
may
not
react
to
the
temptations
that
life
holds
out
at
every
step
every
wise
person
feels
almost
certain
that
if
his
children
are
reared
without
education
without
discipline
without
training
or
opportunities
they
will
almost
inevitably
swell
the
ranks
of
the
criminal
classes
and
it
is
especially
certain
that
if
one
of
his
children
is
defective
or
has
an
unstable
nervous
system
such
a
child
should
never
be
left
without
protection
and
care
there
are
professional
criminals
of
a
different
grade
like
the
forger
and
the
confidence
man
both
of
these
have
generally
had
some
education
and
a
fair
degree
of
intelligence
and
have
had
some
advantages
in
life
the
forger
as
a
rule
is
a
bookkeeper
or
an
accountant
who
grows
expert
with
the
pen
he
works
for
a
small
salary
and
sees
nothing
better
he
grows
familiar
with
signatures
sometimes
he
is
a
clerk
in
a
bank
and
has
the
opportunity
to
study
signatures
he
begins
to
imitate
them
often
with
no
thought
of
forging
paper
he
does
it
because
it
is
an
art
and
probably
the
only
thing
he
can
do
well
perhaps
some
hard
luck
or
an
unfortunate
venture
on
the
board
of
trade
or
in
a
faro
bank
makes
him
write
a
check
or
note
he
easily
convinces
himself
that
he
is
not
getting
the
salary
he
earns
and
that
less
worthy
men
prosper
while
he
is
poor
then
too
his
business
calls
for
better
clothes
and
better
surroundings
than
those
of
the
workingman
and
gives
him
many
glimpses
of
easy
lives
for
a
time
he
may
escape
if
the
amount
is
not
too
large
it
is
often
passed
by
without
an
effort
to
detect
sometimes
it
escapes
notice
altogether
some
business
men
write
so
many
checks
that
they
take
no
pains
at
the
end
of
the
month
to
figure
up
their
account
and
examine
every
check
and
never
notice
it
unless
the
balance
given
by
the
bank
is
so
far
out
of
the
way
that
it
attracts
attention
after
a
forger
grows
to
be
an
expert
he
can
move
from
town
to
town
if
he
is
taken
and
put
in
prison
and
finally
released
he
is
hard
to
cure
forgery
is
too
easy
and
he
knows
of
no
other
trade
so
good
a
large
percentage
of
these
men
never
would
have
forged
had
their
wages
been
higher
many
others
are
the
victims
of
the
disease
they
haunt
the
gambling
houses
brokers
offices
and
the
like
often
when
they
begin
they
expect
to
make
the
check
good
generally
they
would
have
made
good
if
the
right
card
had
only
turned
up
in
the
faro
bank
or
the
right
quotation
on
the
stock
exchange
there
is
another
class
of
forgers
generally
bankers
who
speculate
with
trust
funds
to
cover
up
the
shortage
they
sign
notes
expecting
that
they
will
never
be
presented
and
will
deceive
no
one
but
the
bank
examiner
if
luck
goes
against
them
too
long
the
bank
fails
and
the
forgery
is
discovered
these
are
really
not
forgers
as
they
never
intend
to
get
money
on
the
note
it
is
only
a
part
of
a
means
to
cover
up
the
use
of
trust
funds
of
course
these
men
are
never
professional
forgers
and
are
much
more
apt
to
die
from
suicide
or
a
broken
heart
than
to
repeat
but
with
few
exceptions
the
criminal
comes
from
the
walks
of
the
poor
and
has
no
education
or
next
to
none
for
this
society
is
much
to
blame
sometimes
he
is
obliged
to
go
to
work
too
soon
but
often
he
can
not
learn
at
school
this
is
not
entirely
the
fault
of
the
boy
heredity
it
is
largely
the
fault
of
the
school
a
certain
course
of
study
has
been
laid
out
with
only
slight
changes
this
course
has
come
down
from
the
past
and
is
fixed
and
formal
much
of
it
might
be
of
value
to
a
professional
man
but
most
of
it
is
of
no
value
to
the
man
in
other
walks
of
life
because
a
boy
can
not
learn
arithmetic
grammar
or
geography
or
not
even
learn
to
read
and
write
it
does
not
follow
that
he
can
not
learn
at
all
he
may
possibly
have
marked
mechanical
ability
he
may
have
more
than
the
ordinary
powers
of
adaptation
to
many
kinds
of
work
these
he
could
be
taught
to
do
and
often
to
do
well
under
proper
instruction
he
might
become
greatly
interested
in
some
kind
of
work
and
in
the
study
to
prepare
him
for
the
work
then
too
it
is
more
or
less
misleading
to
say
that
an
uneducated
man
commits
crime
because
he
is
uneducated
often
his
lack
of
education
as
well
as
his
crime
comes
from
poverty
crime
and
poverty
may
come
from
something
else
all
come
because
he
had
a
poor
or
an
insufficient
chance
after
all
the
great
majority
of
men
must
do
some
kind
of
manual
labor
until
the
time
shall
come
when
this
kind
of
work
is
as
easy
and
as
well
paid
as
other
employment
no
one
will
do
manual
labor
if
he
can
do
any
other
kind
perhaps
the
time
may
come
when
the
hardest
and
most
disagreeable
work
will
be
the
best
paid
there
are
too
many
unskilled
workers
in
proportion
to
the
population
to
make
this
seem
very
near
in
the
meantime
and
that
is
doubtless
a
long
time
some
one
must
do
this
work
much
of
it
is
done
under
supervision
and
requires
no
great
skill
and
need
not
be
very
disagreeable
or
hard
in
a
complex
civilization
there
is
room
for
everyone
to
contribute
to
the
whole
if
our
schools
are
some
day
what
they
should
be
a
large
part
of
their
time
in
some
cases
all
of
it
will
be
devoted
to
manual
training
and
will
be
given
to
producing
skilled
workmen
this
sort
of
school
work
can
be
made
attractive
to
thousands
of
boys
who
can
do
nothing
else
and
if
easier
conditions
of
life
under
fairer
social
surroundings
could
be
added
to
this
kind
of
education
most
boys
who
now
drift
into
crime
would
doubtless
find
the
conventional
life
more
profitable
and
attractive
viii
the
female
criminal
women
furnish
only
to
of
the
population
of
penal
institutions
probably
the
percentage
would
be
still
lower
if
among
these
were
not
a
number
of
rather
common
convictions
for
acts
which
are
peculiar
to
women
like
abortion
infanticide
child
abandonment
and
the
like
as
to
the
other
crimes
few
women
are
burglars
or
robbers
or
guilty
of
other
crimes
of
violence
except
murder
women
steal
and
poison
and
blackmail
and
extort
money
and
lie
and
slander
and
gossip
and
probably
cause
as
much
unhappiness
as
men
but
their
crimes
like
their
lives
are
not
on
so
large
or
adventurous
a
scale
they
do
not
so
readily
take
a
chance
they
lack
the
imagination
that
makes
big
criminals
or
lays
broad
schemes
in
many
of
their
crimes
they
are
often
the
accomplices
of
men
and
take
rather
a
minor
part
although
sometimes
a
quite
important
one
for
this
reason
they
are
often
not
detected
and
frequently
not
prosecuted
a
fact
which
leaves
the
percentage
smaller
than
it
otherwise
would
be
then
too
juries
are
apt
to
acquit
women
of
crime
even
when
they
are
indicted
and
tried
it
must
be
a
positive
case
and
one
which
calls
for
no
possible
feeling
of
sympathy
or
where
there
is
no
personal
appeal
that
will
work
the
conviction
of
a
woman
men
have
so
long
adopted
an
attitude
of
chivalry
toward
women
that
very
few
juries
will
convict
them
this
too
has
much
to
do
with
the
small
number
of
female
convicts
some
writers
claim
that
the
small
number
of
women
in
penal
institutions
shows
that
women
are
better
than
men
but
this
is
a
hasty
conclusion
arrived
at
from
insufficient
facts
there
are
fewer
female
prisoners
because
women
have
lived
a
more
protected
life
they
have
not
been
engaged
so
generally
in
business
they
have
not
been
so
constantly
obliged
to
fight
their
way
in
the
world
their
lives
have
been
more
quiet
and
smooth
they
have
been
surrounded
by
strong
conventions
and
closely
watched
especially
is
this
true
with
regard
to
the
girl
as
compared
with
the
boy
such
protection
naturally
keeps
them
from
the
commission
of
crime
the
great
consideration
shown
to
them
by
prosecuting
witnesses
prosecuting
officers
judges
and
juries
supplements
the
protected
life
and
is
an
added
reason
for
the
showing
made
by
statistics
it
is
notorious
that
a
woman
is
seldom
convicted
of
murder
this
has
been
the
subject
of
much
complaint
on
the
part
of
the
public
still
a
man
may
condemn
such
acquittals
and
when
placed
on
a
jury
will
himself
vote
for
acquittal
after
all
the
juries
are
right
most
of
the
cases
of
murder
against
women
involve
sex
relations
nature
has
made
the
bearing
and
rearing
of
children
first
of
all
the
woman
part
and
this
fact
so
dominates
her
life
that
nothing
else
seems
important
to
her
in
comparison
she
is
not
able
to
judge
in
a
broad
and
scientific
way
matters
so
clearly
affecting
life
it
may
even
be
possible
that
in
the
evolution
and
preservation
of
life
her
judgments
are
right
at
least
they
are
the
natural
judgments
for
a
large
number
of
women
or
these
tragedies
would
not
occur
no
doubt
as
woman
enters
the
field
of
industry
formerly
monopolized
by
man
and
as
she
takes
her
part
in
politics
and
sits
on
juries
the
percentage
of
female
criminals
will
rapidly
increase
in
fact
the
percentage
of
women
prisoners
has
been
climbing
for
many
years
as
she
takes
her
place
with
men
she
will
be
more
and
more
judged
as
men
are
judged
and
will
commit
the
crimes
that
men
commit
and
perhaps
furnish
her
fair
quota
to
the
penitentiaries
and
jails
whether
this
will
be
better
or
worse
for
the
race
is
no
part
of
the
discussion
and
can
only
be
told
by
long
experience
women
must
accept
the
facts
and
make
their
choice
of
activities
in
view
of
these
facts
quite
apart
from
any
sentiment
i
think
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
believe
that
men
and
women
should
be
judged
alike
the
structure
and
nervous
system
of
women
cause
physical
and
mental
disturbances
which
affect
their
judgment
and
life
if
there
were
any
justice
in
human
judgment
and
civilization
then
each
human
being
would
be
judged
according
to
his
his
tendencies
his
inclinations
and
his
capacities
and
no
two
would
be
judged
alike
any
sudden
change
in
the
treatment
of
women
in
the
courts
will
work
a
great
injustice
that
will
leave
its
effect
on
both
women
and
men
and
still
more
on
the
life
of
the
race
ix
juvenile
criminals
this
subject
would
scarcely
have
been
noted
a
few
years
ago
true
there
was
in
the
past
a
small
mixture
of
children
in
the
grist
ground
out
in
the
criminal
courts
usually
they
received
some
leniency
and
were
viewed
with
more
curiosity
than
alarm
the
juvenile
criminal
was
regarded
as
a
prodigy
with
a
capacity
for
crimes
far
beyond
his
years
something
of
the
attitude
obtained
in
regard
to
him
which
attaches
to
the
child
chess
player
or
the
child
mathematician
the
child
criminal
is
now
common
and
for
the
most
part
is
a
product
of
the
city
all
crime
is
doubtless
much
more
common
in
the
city
than
the
country
and
the
young
criminal
especially
is
a
product
of
the
crowded
community
to
those
who
look
for
natural
causes
for
all
phenomena
the
reason
is
not
far
to
seek
the
city
itself
is
an
abnormal
thing
primitive
man
and
his
ancestors
were
never
huddled
together
in
great
multitudes
as
are
the
dwellers
in
cities
today
to
a
degree
almost
all
animals
are
gregarious
but
the
units
of
organization
are
much
smaller
with
them
than
with
man
excepting
possibly
in
the
case
of
the
ant
and
the
bee
insects
which
seem
specially
adapted
to
live
a
highly
automatic
and
cooperative
life
such
as
human
beings
can
not
possibly
reach
but
primitive
men
and
their
direct
ancestors
lived
in
small
groups
they
could
not
have
preserved
their
life
in
any
other
way
they
lived
by
fishing
and
hunting
and
by
gathering
roots
berries
and
herbs
later
they
tended
their
flocks
and
cultivated
the
fields
in
a
simple
way
with
the
introduction
of
the
modern
machine
the
factory
system
and
the
railroads
in
the
last
century
our
great
modern
cities
were
evolved
as
they
grew
more
complicated
new
problems
arose
the
life
of
the
crowded
city
is
most
difficult
even
for
normal
men
and
women
the
adjustments
are
too
numerous
and
too
complex
for
an
animal
made
with
simple
tastes
and
for
a
pastoral
life
but
if
it
is
hard
for
men
it
is
almost
hopeless
for
children
especially
the
children
of
the
poor
who
fill
our
prisons
asylums
and
almshouses
every
child
needs
the
open
air
and
the
open
life
of
the
country
he
needs
first
of
all
exercise
which
should
be
in
the
form
of
outdoor
play
no
healthy
boy
wants
to
live
indoors
even
though
his
home
may
be
a
convenient
city
flat
the
woods
the
fields
the
streams
the
lakes
the
wide
common
with
plenty
of
room
have
always
made
their
natural
appeal
to
the
young
and
as
sunlight
kills
most
of
the
deadly
germs
so
outdoor
life
with
exercise
and
play
takes
care
of
most
of
the
unhealthy
thoughts
habits
and
ideas
of
in
the
past
our
schools
both
in
the
city
and
country
have
done
little
to
help
the
young
for
the
most
part
healthy
children
have
always
looked
on
them
more
or
less
as
prisons
here
they
have
been
confined
and
kept
from
exercise
and
play
to
study
useless
and
unrelated
facts
and
to
commit
to
memory
dry
rules
which
are
forgotten
as
soon
as
their
minds
are
ready
to
retain
anything
worth
while
schools
should
be
made
to
fit
the
needs
of
children
and
not
children
to
fit
schools
the
school
that
does
not
provide
work
and
play
for
the
child
which
he
is
glad
to
do
has
learned
little
of
the
psychology
and
needs
of
youth
botany
zoölogy
geology
and
even
chemistry
can
be
taught
to
children
before
they
learn
to
read
and
taught
so
that
it
will
seem
like
play
and
through
this
the
pupil
will
acquire
a
natural
taste
for
books
it
is
only
within
the
last
few
years
that
the
modern
school
has
really
begun
to
educate
the
child
it
has
been
a
hard
fight
that
scientific
teachers
have
waged
with
conventional
education
for
the
right
of
the
child
what
has
been
done
is
too
recent
and
scattering
to
show
material
results
nothing
is
so
important
to
the
child
as
education
the
early
life
is
the
time
that
character
is
formed
habits
are
made
rules
of
conduct
taught
and
it
is
almost
impossible
to
old
habits
and
inhibitions
and
implant
new
ones
in
later
years
it
is
true
that
the
child
is
father
to
the
man
and
he
is
the
father
of
the
criminal
as
well
as
the
useful
citizen
outside
of
the
hopelessly
defective
or
those
who
have
very
imperfect
nervous
or
physical
systems
there
is
no
reason
why
a
child
who
has
had
proper
mental
and
physical
training
and
any
fair
opportunity
in
life
should
ever
be
a
criminal
even
most
of
the
mentally
defective
and
those
suffering
from
imperfect
nervous
systems
could
be
useful
to
society
in
a
sheltered
environment
poor
as
the
country
schools
have
always
been
the
outdoor
life
of
the
country
child
is
still
so
great
an
influence
that
he
generally
escapes
disaster
he
is
not
sent
to
a
factory
but
lives
in
a
small
community
where
he
has
fresh
air
and
exercise
of
course
here
as
everywhere
we
must
allow
for
the
defective
the
imperfect
the
subnormals
and
the
children
of
the
very
poor
these
unfortunates
furnish
a
large
percentage
of
the
inmates
of
prison
and
most
of
the
victims
for
the
scaffold
which
civilization
so
fondly
preserves
the
growth
of
the
big
cities
has
produced
the
child
criminal
he
is
clearly
marked
and
well
defined
he
is
often
subnormal
even
down
to
idiocy
in
most
cases
he
is
the
result
of
heredity
many
times
he
may
have
fair
intelligence
but
this
is
usually
attached
to
an
unstable
defective
nervous
system
that
can
not
do
its
proper
work
and
he
has
had
no
expert
treatment
and
attention
he
is
always
poor
generally
he
has
lost
one
or
both
parents
in
youth
and
has
lived
in
the
crowded
districts
where
the
home
was
congested
he
has
no
adequate
playground
and
he
runs
the
streets
or
vacant
waste
places
he
associates
and
combines
with
others
of
his
kind
he
can
not
or
does
not
go
to
school
if
he
goes
to
school
he
dreads
to
go
and
can
not
learn
the
lessons
in
the

he
likes
to
loaf
just
as
all
children
like
to
play
he
is
often
set
to
work
he
has
no
trade
and
little
capacity
for
skilled
work
that
brings
good
wages
and
steady
employment
he
works
no
more
than
he
needs
to
work
every
night
and
all
the
days
that
he
can
get
are
spent
in
idleness
on
the
street
with
his
gang
he
seldom
reads
books
he
lacks
the
taste
for
books
and
such
teachers
as
he
knew
had
not
the
wit
to
cultivate
a
taste
for
good
reading
such
books
as
he
gets
only
add
to
his
unhealthy
thoughts
many
writers
have
classified
the
crimes
that
the
boy
commits
it
is
scarcely
worth
the
while
he
learns
to
steal
or
becomes
a
burglar
largely
for
the
love
of
adventure
he
robs
because
it
is
exciting
and
may
bring
large
returns
in
his
excursions
to
pilfer
property
he
may
kill
and
then
for
the
first
time
the
state
discovers
that
there
is
such
a
boy
and
sets
in
action
the
machinery
to
take
his
life
the
city
quite
probably
has
given
him
a
casual
notice
by
arresting
him
a
number
of
times
and
sending
him
to
a
juvenile
prison
but
it
has
rarely
extended
a
hand
to
help
him
any
man
or
woman
who
has
fairly
normal
faculties
and
can
reason
from
cause
to
effect
knows
that
the
crimes
of
children
are
really
the
crimes
of
the
state
and
society
which
by
neglect
and
active
participation
have
made
him
what
he
is
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
man
is
the
child
grown
up
it
is
equally
easy
to
understand
the
adult
prisoner
x
homicide
crimes
against
persons
are
not
always
as
easy
to
classify
and
understand
as
crimes
against
property
these
acts
are
so
numerous
and
come
from
so
many
different
emotions
and
motives
that
often
the
cause
is
obscure
and
the
explanation
not
easy
to
find
still
here
as
everywhere
in
nature
nothing
can
happen
without
a
cause
and
even
where
limited
knowledge
does
its
best
and
can
not
find
causes
our
recognition
of
the
connection
between
cause
and
effect
and
the
of
law
can
leave
no
doubt
that
complete
knowledge
would
bring
complete
understanding
it
is
always
to
be
borne
in
mind
in
considering
this
class
of
crimes
that
the
motive
power
of
life
is
not
reason
but
instinct
if
men
lived
by
reason
the
race
would
not
survive
the
primal
things
that
preserve
the
race
the
hunger
for
food
drink
sex
are
instinctive
and
not
only
are
not
awakened
or
satisfied
by
reason
but
oftentimes
in
violation
of
it
nature
first
of
all
sees
to
the
preservation
of
the
species
and
acts
in
a
broad
way
that
life
may
not
perish
nature
knows
nothing
about
right
and
wrong
in
the
sense
in
which
man
uses
these
words
all
of
our
moral
conceptions
are
purely
of
social
origin
and
hence
not
instinctive
in
human
life
and
are
forever
giving
way
to
the
instincts
on
which
nature
depends
the
preservation
of
life
has
called
for
the
emotions
of
hate
fear
and
love
among
the
other
emotions
that
move
men
the
animal
fears
danger
and
runs
away
and
thus
life
is
preserved
the
weaker
animal
is
almost
entirely
dependent
for
life
upon
his
fear
he
is
sometimes
afraid
when
there
is
no
danger
but
without
fear
he
would
be
destroyed
sometimes
the
animal
hates
and
kills
and
thus
preserves
himself
the
love
of
offspring
is
the
cause
of
the
care
bestowed
upon
it
which
preserves
its
life
the
herd
instinct
in
animal
species
develops
packs
and
clans
and
tribes
and
states
man
is
the
heir
to
all
the
past
and
the
instincts
and
emotions
of
the
primitive
animal
are
strong
in
his
being
these
may
have
been
strengthened
or
diluted
as
the
ages
have
come
and
gone
but
the
same
instincts
furnish
the
motive
power
for
all
his
acts
man
fears
and
hates
and
runs
or
kills
and
saves
his
life
he
loves
and
preserves
his
offspring
man
sees
an
object
instinctively
he
may
fear
it
or
he
may
hate
it
he
may
run
from
it
or
destroy
it
he
gathers
impressions
through
his
senses
the
nerves
carry
them
to
the
brain
he
comes
to
fear
certain
persons
and
things
to
hate
certain
other
persons
or
things
and
to
love
still
others
if
the
hatred
is
strong
enough
or
the
danger
great
enough
or
the
desire
sufficient
he
may
kill
whether
he
plans
the
method
or
deliberates
upon
the
act
can
make
no
difference
he
is
prompted
by
the
instinct
and
the
reflection
simply
means
the
consideration
of
reasons
for
and
against
or
the
reaching
of
inhibitions
if
he
acts
it
is
one
of
the
primal
emotions
that
causes
the
act
he
is
the
machine
through
which
certain
emotions
find
their
path
and
do
their
work
infinite
are
the
causes
and
circumstances
that
give
rise
to
an
emotion
strong
enough
to
take
human
life
killings
which
result
from
a
sudden
passion
are
easily
understood
everyone
has
been
overwhelmed
by
rage
where
reason
and
judgment
and
all
acquired
restraints
are
entirely
submerged
the
primitive
man
with
his
primitive
emotion
reasserts
himself
it
is
mainly
accident
or
the
lack
of
some
particular
circumstance
that
prevents
a
murder
of
course
some
people
are
overwhelmed
more
easily
than
others
some
natures
are
less
stable
some
nervous
systems
less
perfect
and
the
built
up
barriers
are
weaker
the
whole
result
of
stimuli
is
determined
by
the
strength
of
the
feeling
acting
upon
the
machine
such
a
person
is
not
ordinarily
dangerous
to
the
community
the
act
itself
would
generally
assure
that
it
could
never
happen
again
some
killings
however
are
more
deliberate
they
are
preceded
by
a
settled
hatred
which
preys
upon
the
mind
and
fights
against
the
preventive
influences
that
training
and
habit
have
formed
under
a
certain
combination
of
circumstances
these
restrictions
are
swept
aside
and
the
emotions
have
their
way
there
are
of
course
certain
broad
classifications
of
homicides
a
considerable
number
perhaps
more
than
any
other
come
through
the
commission
of
robbery
burglary
and
larceny
in
the
midst
of
the
act
the
offender
is
caught
and
kills
in
an
effort
to
escape
these
murders
fall
under
the
heading
of
property
crimes
the
cause
is
the
same
and
the
rules
governing
them
are
the
same
the
second
group
with
respect
to
numbers
grows
from
the
relations
of
men
and
women
wives
kill
husbands
and
husbands
kill
wives
sweethearts
kill
each
other
jealousy
and
revenge
are
commonly
mixed
with
sex
life
and
sex
association
many
socialists
have
argued
that
under
an
equal
distribution
of
property
where
women
were
freed
from
fear
of
want
these
crimes
would
disappear
but
this
argument
does
not
take
human
nature
into
account
jealousy
is
inevitably
associated
with
sex
relations
the
close
contact
of
men
and
women
over
long
periods
of
time
inevitably
causes
friction
and
misunderstanding
these
conditions
often
grow
chronic
and
in
marriage
are
aggravated
by
the
necessity
of
close
association
regardless
of
the
real
feelings
that
may
exist
certain
claims
are
made
by
husbands
and
by
wives
which
are
probably
inherent
in
the
relationship
sometimes
they
flow
from
habit
and
custom
but
from
whatever
cause
such
claims
are
so
exacting
that
either
the
husband
or
wife
finds
them
hard
to
meet
because
of
the
fact
that
the
feelings
of
men
and
women
for
each
other
are
deeper
and
more
fundamental
than
those
of
any
other
relation
they
are
more
subject
to
misfortune
and
tragedy
the
hatreds
born
from
the
deepest
affection
are
most
beyond
control
then
the
desire
of
possession
is
overwhelming
it
would
be
strange
if
more
killings
did
not
result
from
the
relations
of
men
and
women
than
from
any
other
cause
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
this
is
true
it
is
likewise
easy
to
understand
how
laws
reason
and
judgment
are
powerless
to
prevent
juries
seem
to
understand
this
when
women
kill
husbands
and
lovers
but
a
code
of
chivalry
and
a
cultivated
attitude
toward
women
which
is
partly
right
and
partly
wrong
make
it
impossible
to
see
that
men
are
just
as
helpless
under
strong
feelings
as
women
no
doubt
a
public
opinion
that
would
favor
divorces
on
a
greater
number
of
grounds
and
make
them
easily
obtainable
would
prevent
large
numbers
of
such
killings
but
the
cause
can
not
be
altogether
removed
the
law
has
long
singled
out
killing
as
the
greatest
crime
doubtless
because
man
prizes
life
first
of
all
of
course
every
effort
should
be
made
to
protect
life
still
in
measuring
the
character
of
the
offender
in
determining
his
possibilities
as
a
useful
citizen
homicide
is
probably
one
of
the
lesser
crimes
many
times
it
implies
no
moral
turpitude
even
with
those
who
believe
in
moral
turpitude
it
may
imply
very
little
lack
of
physical
stability
homicide
practically
never
becomes
an
occupation
most
killings
are
accidental
in
the
sense
that
they
are
casual
and
dependent
on
circumstances
and
there
is
as
a
rule
much
less
danger
of
repetition
than
there
is
of
the
original
commission
of
a
homicide
by
one
of
a
defective
nervous
system
who
has
never
before
committed
an
unlawful
act
a
large
number
of
men
convicted
of
murder
are
used
as
trusties
in
our
penal
institutions
even
when
their
imprisonment
is
for
a
long
term
or
for
life
this
shows
from
the
experience
of
prison
officials
that
this
class
of
offenders
is
as
a
rule
of
a
better
fibre
than
almost
any
other
class
doubtless
no
sort
of
treatment
will
ever
entirely
get
rid
of
homicide
brains
and
nervous
systems
are
so
made
that
inhibitions
are
unable
to
protect
in
all
cases
nations
and
men
readily
engage
in
killing
either
from
sport
or
because
of
a
real
or
fancied
wrong
mob
psychology
shows
how
whole
communities
are
turned
into
ravenous
beasts
hunting
for
their
prey
the
world
war
and
all
wars
show
cases
of
mob
psychology
that
have
led
large
masses
of
men
to
take
an
active
part
in
killing
the
pursuit
of
those
charged
with
crime
shows
that
all
people
like
the
chase
when
the
emotions
are
thoroughly
aroused
under
certain
impulses
communities
gloat
over
hangings
and
commend
judges
and
juries
because
they
have
the
courage
to
hang
when
in
fact
they
were
too
cowardly
not
to
hang
and
when
their
reason
did
not
approve
the
verdict
and
judgment
men
who
do
not
kill
often
wish
others
might
die
and
are
pleased
and
happy
when
they
do
die
we
approve
of
death
when
it
is
the
right
one
who
dies
whether
all
persons
are
murderers
or
not
may
depend
upon
a
definition
of
murder
but
beyond
doubt
all
persons
are
potential
murderers
needing
only
time
and
circumstances
and
a
sufficiently
overwhelming
emotion
that
will
triumph
over
the
weak
restraints
that
education
and
habit
have
built
up
to
control
the
powerful
surging
instincts
and
feelings
that
nature
has
laid
at
the
foundation
of
life
xi
sex
crimes
most
of
the
inmates
of
prisons
convicted
of
sex
crimes
are
the
poor
and
wretched
and
the
plainly
defective
nature
in
her
determination
to
preserve
the
species
has
planted
sex
hunger
very
deep
in
the
constitution
of
man
the
fact
that
it
is
necessary
for
the
preservation
of
life
and
that
nature
is
always
eliminating
those
whose
sex
hunger
is
not
strong
enough
to
preserve
the
race
has
overweighted
man
and
perhaps
all
animal
life
with
this
hunger
at
least
it
has
endowed
many
men
with
instincts
too
powerful
for
the
conventions
and
the
laws
that
hedge
him
about
rape
is
almost
always
the
crime
of
the
poor
the
hardworking
the
uneducated
and
the
abnormal
in
the
man
of
this
type
sex
hunger
is
strong
he
has
little
money
generally
no
family
he
is
poorly
fed
and
clothed
and
possesses
few
if
any
attractions
he
may
be
a
sailor
away
from
women
and
their
society
for
months
or
in
some
other
remote
occupation
making
his
means
of
gratifying
this
hunger
just
as
impossible
there
is
no
opportunity
for
him
except
the
one
he
adopts
it
is
a
question
of
gratifying
this
deep
and
primal
instinct
as
against
the
weakness
of
his
mentality
and
the
few
barriers
that
a
meagre
education
and
habits
can
furnish
and
when
the
instinct
overbalances
he
is
lost
incest
which
is
peculiarly
the
crime
of
the
weak
the
wretched
and
the
poor
has
a
somewhat
different
origin
westermarck
in
his
of
human
shows
that
in
the
early
tribe
there
was
no
inhibition
against
the
marriage
of
blood
relations
that
the
restriction
then
was
against
the
members
of
the
tribe
that
used
one
tent
these
might
or
might
not
be
blood
relations
the
traditions
and
against
the
marriage
of
close
relations
grew
from
the
familiarity
that
came
from
the
living
together
of
brother
and
sister
for
instance
in
one
home
this
feeling
gradually
worked
itself
into
custom
and
habit
and
from
that
into
and
laws
sometimes
we
read
accounts
of
the
marriage
of
a
man
and
woman
who
found
after
years
had
gone
by
that
they
were
brother
and
sister
who
had
been
separated
in
infancy
and
grew
up
without
knowledge
of
their
relation
to
each
other
whether
nature
forbids
the
marriage
of
relatives
by
preventing
offspring
or
by
producing
imperfect
offspring
is
a
doubtful
question
certain
communities
in
europe
have
lived
together
so
long
that
all
are
related
and
still
they
seem
to
thrive
considering
the
general
custom
and
feeling
on
the
subject
however
the
man
and
woman
who
know
that
they
are
closely
related
and
who
marry
are
different
and
weaker
than
the
others
and
this
may
show
in
their
offspring
although
the
subnormal
may
have
no
such
feeling
they
are
judged
by
the
traditions
and
customs
of
the
normal
and
on
that
judgment
are
sent
to
prison
many
sex
crimes
are
charged
to
children
in
the
adolescent
age
children
who
have
no
knowledge
of
sex
and
its
development
and
are
helpless
in
the
strength
of
their
feelings
this
class
of
offenders
is
almost
always
the
inferior
and
the
poor
who
are
moved
by
strong
instincts
which
they
have
not
the
natural
feeling
the
strength
the
education
nor
the
desire
to
withstand
while
most
crimes
against
persons
are
not
directly
due
to
economic
causes
still
the
indirect
effect
of
property
is
generally
present
in
these
crimes
as
well
as
others
the
fact
that
the
poor
and
defective
are
generally
the
subjects
of
prosecution
and
conviction
in
these
offences
shows
how
closely
economic
conditions
are
related
to
all
crimes
other
criminal
statutes
are
of
more
modern
date
and
as
a
rule
involve
not
much
more
than
adultery
except
in
regard
to
the
age
of
the
girl
offender
which
is
generally
placed
below
eighteen
still
the
sex
age
of
neither
boys
nor
girls
can
be
fixed
by
a
calendar
it
depends
really
upon
development
which
is
not
the
same
with
all
people
or
in
all
environments
many
girls
of
sixteen
are
more
mature
and
have
more
experience
of
life
than
others
of
twenty
most
laws
provide
that
below
sixteen
one
can
not
give
consent
and
that
a
sexual
act
is
then
rape
it
is
doubtful
if
there
should
be
any
intermediate
age
between
sixteen
and
eighteen
where
an
act
is
not
rape
but
still
a
minor
offence
xii
robbery
and
burglary
robbery
and
burglary
are
generally
counted
as
crimes
of
violence
but
they
should
be
properly
classed
under
property
crimes
every
motive
that
leads
to
getting
property
in
illegal
ways
applies
to
these
crimes
there
is
added
to
the
regular
causes
of
property
crimes
the
element
of
danger
and
adventure
which
makes
a
strong
appeal
to
boys
and
men
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
few
mature
men
have
committed
one
of
these
crimes
unless
they
began
criminal
careers
as
boys
such
crimes
especially
appeal
to
the
activity
and
love
of
adventure
which
inhere
in
every
boy
they
are
committed
for
the
most
part
by
youths
who
have
had
almost
no
chance
to
get
the
needed
sport
and
physical
experience
incident
to
boyhood
the
polo
or
golf
player
very
seldom
becomes
a
robber
or
a
burglar
almost
no
rich
man
or
rich
man
son
becomes
a
robber
or
a
burglar
those
who
fall
under
this
lure
are
mainly
the
denizens
of
the
streets
the
railroad
yards
the
vacant
lots
the
casual
workers
who
are
stimulated
by
a
variety
of
conditions
to
get
property
unlawfully
added
to
this
are
almost
invariably
a
defective
heredity
vicious
environment
little
education
and
a
total
want
of
direction
in
the
building
up
of
habits
and
inhibitions
the
robber
or
burglar
who
kills
in
the
commission
of
crime
is
more
dangerous
and
harder
to
cure
than
the
one
who
kills
from
passion
or
malice
there
is
always
the
element
of
an
occupation
for
getting
property
and
generally
a
love
of
adventure
that
is
difficult
to
overcome
except
by
a
substantial
change
of
social
relations
which
makes
acquiring
property
easier
for
the
class
from
which
all
these
criminals
develop
the
murder
that
comes
from
passion
and
feeling
implies
situations
and
circumstances
that
are
rarely
strong
enough
to
overcome
the
restrictions
against
killing
xiii
man
as
a
predatory
animal
not
less
than
eighty
per
cent
of
all
crimes
are
property
crimes
and
it
seems
probable
that
of
the
rest
most
arise
from
the
same
motives
if
we
look
at
civilization
as
the
result
of
that
seesaw
trend
of
the
race
from
naturalism
to
artificialism
we
may
get
a
flexible
view
of
life
that
will
be
in
accordance
with
the
facts
and
will
help
us
to
get
rid
of
the
arbitrary
division
of
man
history
into
the
three
periods
termed
savagery
barbarism
and
civilization
however
desirable
this
division
may
be
for
historic
purposes
in
general
it
is
only
confusing
in
an
effort
to
study
the
nature
of
man
in
the
life
and
origin
of
the
race
the
fact
is
always
evidenced
that
the
ego
through
its
growth
and
persistence
is
always
drawing
to
itself
from
the
current
of
environment
all
things
which
it
feels
desirable
to
its
life
and
growth
this
must
be
a
necessary
condition
of
survival
in
the
long
journey
from
amoeba
to
man
any
circumstance
causing
a
complete
halt
for
even
a
brief
period
meant
extinction
while
even
a
persistent
interference
produced
a
weakened
organism
if
not
an
arrest
of
development
this
then
is
the
origin
of
the
master
instinct
hunger
when
we
consider
the
various
emotions
growing
from
the
force
of
this
vital
urge
as
developed
by
adaptation
to
an
environment
we
are
able
to
realize
fully
why
it
bulks
so
large
in
moulding
and
shaping
the
destiny
of
the
race
all
psychologists
are
agreed
in
classing
under
the
nutritive
instinct
such
activities
as

storing
and
hoarding
during
a
period
variously
estimated
as
a
quarter
of
a

two
million
years
man
and
his

antecedents
responded
to
the
hunger
instinct
in
the
manner
and
by
the

methods
as
did

arose
and
food
and

were
held
in

but
since
the
commended
raiding
and
looting
between
alien
tribes
here
was
presented
an
alluring
chance
to
secure
both
booty
and
glory
to
men
trained
in
the
get

process
of

for
thousands
of

depended
upon
this
unerring
exercise
it
was
during

that

developed
his
big
brain

involving
the
central
nervous
system
furthermore
it
was
developed
by
and

to
these
particular
reactions
the
control
of
the
mind
must
be
remembered
as
upon
this
through
his

must
be
based
his
conflicting
impulses
these
must
be
reckoned
with
in
our
conclusions
with

to

economic
or
otherwise
during
the
last
thirty
years
psychological
laboratories
aided
by
physiology
through
experiments
conducted
with
weighing
and
measuring
instruments
of
marvelous
accuracy
have
put
us
in
possession
of
an
array
of
facts
unknown
to
students
of
earlier
periods
who
sought
the
why
and
the
how
of
man
erratic
actions
as
a
social
animal
it
is
constantly
being
demonstrated
that
under
given
conditions
moved
by
appropriate
stimuli
the
human
animal
inevitably
and
surely
reacts
the
same
as
does
inorganic
matter
if
we
understand
intelligence
to
be
the
capacity
to
respond
to
new
conditions
we
can
measurably
see
and
at
least
partly
understand
the
constant
of
heredity
and
environment
between
these
there
is
no
antagonism
the
sum
of
life
experiences
consists
solely
in
the
adjustments
required
to
enable
the
sentient
organism
man
or
beast
to
live
how
readily
a
to
earlier
and
cruder
life
may
be
brought
about
under
favorable
conditions
is
shown
by
the
methods
and
virulence
of
combat
during
the
vicious
massacre
in
the
war
just
ended
can
the
conclusion
be
evaded
that
individually
and
collectively
we
constantly
teeter
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
if
we
fall
it
spells
crime
or
misfortune
or
both
wherever
civilization
exists
on
the
private
property
basis
as
its
main
bulwark
we
find
crime
as
an
inseparable
result
man
by
virtue
of
his
organic
nature
is
a
predatory
animal
this
does
not
mean
that
he
is
a
vicious
animal
it
simply
means
that
man
in
common
with
the
eagle
and
the
wolf
acts
in
accordance
with
the
urge
and
fundamental
instincts
of
his
organic
structure
in
any
conflict
between
newer
and
nobler
sentiments
and
the
emotions
which
function
through
the
primeval
instincts
he
is
shackled
to
the
master
instincts
in
such
manner
that
they
usually
win
this
is
conclusively
shown
by
the
history
of
the
race
if
this
is
true
we
should
expect
to
find
the
master
hunger
specially
active
through
the
many
chances
presented
for
exploitation
after
the
fall
of
feudalism
beginning
let
us
assume
with
the
invention
of
power
machinery
the
age
of
steam
it
is
apparent
that
from
that
time
to
our
own
day
man
acquisitive
tendency
has
so
expanded
that
if
we
were
capable
of
an
unbiased
opinion
it
might
be
said
to
be
a
form
of
megalomania
gripping
the
entire
white
race
where
commerce
and
industry
are
found
in
their
most
vigorous
forms
if
our
theory
is
correct
we
should
expect
to
find
the
most
energetic
and
enterprising
nations
showing
a
greater
ratio
of
property
crimes
than
the
invalid
and
feeble
nations
this
would
more
certainly
be
true
where
political
constitutions
by
letter
and
spirit
encourage
and
promote
individual
development
mental
and
industrial
when
this
condition
exists
with
abundant
natural
resources
such
as
often
may
be
found
in
what
we
term
a
new
country
it
furnishes
the
chance
for
the
most
vigorous
functioning
of
whatsoever
may
be
the
dominant
qualities
inherent
in
the
tendencies
and
aspirations
of
a
people
the
united
states
of
america
among
the
nations
meets
these
conditions
and
we
find
here
the
highest
ratio
of
property
crimes
per
capita
this
holds
as
to
all
such
crimes
both
minor
and
major
which
are
far
in
excess
of
those
of
any
other
nation
as
shown
by
statistics
it
seems
clear
that
this
explanation
shows
the
main
reason
for
the
seemingly
abnormal
number
of
property
crimes
in
the
united
states
man
infinitely
long
past
developed
the
hunger
instinct
which
made
him
take
directly
and
simply
where
he
could
and
as
he
could
this
is
always
urging
him
to
supply
his
wants
in
the
simplest
way
regardless
of
the
later
restrictions
that
modern
civilization
has
placed
around
the
getting
of
property
with
the
weaker
intellectually
and
physically
these
instincts
are
the
superficial
and
absurd
theories
that
his
excesses
are
due
to
the
lack
of
the
certainty
of
punishment
take
no
account
of
the
life
experience
and
the
inherent
structure
of
man
especially
in
our
large
cities
with
their
great
opportunities
for
the
creation
and
accumulation
of
wealth
the
lust
of
power
is
shown
by
the
efforts
to
obtain
wealth
by
the
most
reckless
methods
the
emotion
drives
us
to
spend
extravagantly
and
conspicuously
that
we
may
inspire
the
envy
of
our
neighbors
by
our
money
and
power
this
is
an
old
emotion
securing
a
new
outlet
and
tenfold
magnified
in
force
through
modern
conditions
in
commercial
and
industrial
life
is
it
not
plain
that
in
america
it
has
assumed
the
form
of
an
obsession
biting
us
high
and
low
until
we
reek
of
it
it
is
likewise
clear
that
it
is
a
menace
to
any
abiding
peace
and
welfare
that
it
is
still
growing
and
leaving
a
bitter
harvest
of
neurasthenics
in
its
wake
the
criminologist
must
face
the
fact
that
in
spite
of
contrary
pretenses
by
most
of
our
social
doctors
we
are
still
in
our
life
guided
almost
exclusively
by
the
mores
the
of
old
founded
on
expediency
as
revealed
by
experiences
and
acquired
by
the
only
known
process
that
of
trial
and
error
if
this
be
true
it
clearly
follows
that
in
order
to
conserve
any
vestige
of
a
civilization
we
must
realize
the
fact
that
property
crimes
are
the
normal
results
of
the
complex
activities
making
up
the
treadmill
called
civilization
we
must
likewise
realize
that
to
modify
these
crimes
we
must
modify
the
trend
of
the
race
when
the
seamy
side
of
man
behavior
is
scrutinized
by
science
it
can
not
be
other
than
grim
and
distressing
to
the
reader
it
is
this
to
the
writer
but
all
the
really
significant
facts
of
life
are
grim
and
often
repulsive
in
the
material
presented
to
the
irony
of
facts
must
be
ascribed
the
shadows
as
well
as
the
high
lights
no
distortions
or
speculations
can
influence
the
findings
of
science
they
are
accessible
and
can
be
checked
up
by
any
one
sufficiently
interested
the
student
knows
that
man
is
what
he
is
because
of
his
origin
and
long
and
painful
past
xiv
crimes
against
property
by
far
the
largest
class
of
crimes
may
be
called
crimes
against
property
strictly
speaking
these
are
crimes
in
relation
to
the
ownership
of
property
criminal
ways
of
depriving
the
lawful
owner
of
its
possession
many
writers
claim
that
nearly
all
crime
is
caused
by
economic
conditions
or
in
other
words
that
poverty
is
practically
the
whole
cause
of
crime
endless
statistics
have
been
gathered
on
this
subject
which
seem
to
show
conclusively
that
property
crimes
are
largely
the
result
of
the
unequal
distribution
of
wealth
but
crime
of
any
class
can
not
safely
be
ascribed
to
a
single
cause
life
is
too
complex
heredity
is
too
variant
and
imperfect
too
many
separate
things
contribute
to
human
behavior
to
make
it
possible
to
trace
all
actions
to
a
single
cause
no
one
familiar
with
courts
and
prisons
can
fail
to
observe
the
close
relation
between
poverty
and
crime
all
lawyers
know
that
the
practice
of
criminal
law
is
a
poor
business
most
lawyers
of
ability
refuse
such
practice
because
it
offers
no
financial
rewards
nearly
all
the
inmates
of
penal
institutions
are
without
money
this
is
true
of
almost
all
men
who
are
placed
on
trial
broad
generalizations
have
been
made
from
statistics
gathered
for
at
least
years
it
has
been
noted
in
every
civilized
country
that
the
number
of
property
crimes
materially
increases
in
the
cold
months
and
diminishes
in
the
spring
summer
and
early
autumn
the
obvious
cause
is
that
employment
is
less
regular
in
the
winter
time
expenses
of
living
are
higher
idle
workers
are
more
numerous
wages
are
lower
and
in
short
it
is
harder
for
the
poor
to
live
most
men
and
women
spend
their
whole
lives
close
to
the
line
of
want
they
have
little
or
nothing
laid
by
sickness
hard
luck
or
lack
of
work
makes
them
penniless
and
desperate
this
drives
many
over
the
uncertain
line
between
lawful
and
unlawful
conduct
and
they
land
in
jail
there
are
more
crimes
committed
in
hard
times
than
in
good
times
when
wages
are
comparatively
high
and
work
is
steady
fewer
men
enter
the
occupation
of
crime
strikes
lockouts
panics
and
the
like
always
leave
their
list
of
unfortunates
in
the
prisons
every
lawyer
engaged
in
criminal
practice
has
noticed
the
large
numbers
of
prosecutions
and
convictions
for
all
sorts
of
offences
that
follow
in
the
wake
of
strikes
and
lockouts
the
cost
of
living
has
also
had
a
direct
effect
on
crime
long
ago
buckle
in
his
of
collected
statistics
showing
that
crime
rose
and
fell
in
direct
ratio
to
the
price
of
food
the
life
health
and
conduct
of
animals
are
directly
dependent
upon
the
food
supply
when
the
pasture
is
poor
cattle
jump
the
fences
when
food
is
scarce
in
the
mountains
and
woods
the
deer
come
down
to
the
farms
and
villages
and
the
same
general
laws
that
affect
all
other
animal
life
affect
men
when
men
are
in
want
or
even
when
their
standard
of
living
is
falling
they
will
take
means
to
get
food
or
its
equivalent
that
they
would
not
think
of
adopting
except
from
need
this
is
doubly
true
when
a
family
is
dependent
for
its
daily
bread
upon
its
own
efforts
always
bearing
in
mind
that
most
criminals
are
men
whose
equipment
and
surroundings
have
made
it
difficult
for
them
to
make
the
adjustments
to
environment
necessary
for
success
in
life
we
may
easily
see
how
any
increase
of
difficulties
will
lead
to
crime
most
men
are
not
well
prepared
for
life
even
in
the
daily
matter
of
the
way
to
spend
their
money
they
lack
the
judgment
necessary
to
get
the
most
from
what
they
have
as
families
increase
debts
increase
until
many
a
man
finds
himself
in
a
net
of
difficulties
with
no
way
out
but
crime
men
whose
necessities
have
led
them
to
embezzlement
and
larceny
turn
up
so
regularly
that
they
hardly
attract
attention
neither
does
punishment
seem
to
deter
others
from
following
the
same
path
although
the
danger
of
detection
disgrace
and
prison
is
perfectly
clear
sometimes
of
course
men
of
education
and
apparent
lack
of
physical
defect
commit
property
crimes
bankers
often
take
money
on
deposit
after
the
bank
is
insolvent
not
infrequently
they
forge
notes
to
cover
losses
and
in
various
ways
manipulate
funds
to
prevent
the
discovery
of
insolvency
as
a
rule
the
condition
of
the
bank
is
brought
about
by
the
use
of
funds
for
speculation
with
the
intention
of
repaying
from
what
seems
to
be
a
safe
venture
sometimes
it
comes
through
bad
loans
and
unforeseen
conditions
business
men
and
bankers
frequently
shock
their
friends
and
the
community
by
suicide
on
disclosures
showing
they
have
embezzled
money
to
use
on
some
financial
venture
that
came
to
a
disastrous
end
these
cases
are
not
difficult
to
understand
the
love
of
money
is
the
controlling
emotion
of
the
age
just
as
religion
war
learning
invention
and
discovery
have
been
the
moving
passions
of
former
ages
so
now
the
accumulation
of
large
fortunes
is
the
main
object
that
moves
man
it
does
not
follow
that
this
phase
will
not
pass
away
and
give
place
to
something
more
worth
while
but
while
it
lasts
it
will
claim
its
victims
just
as
other
strong
emotions
in
turn
have
done
the
fear
of
poverty
especially
by
those
who
have
known
something
of
the
value
of
money
the
desire
for
the
power
that
money
brings
the
envy
of
others
the
opportunities
that
seem
easy
all
these
feelings
are
too
strong
for
many
fairly
good
machines
and
bring
disaster
when
plans
go
wrong
only
a
small
portion
of
those
who
have
speculated
with
trust
funds
are
ever
prosecuted
generally
the
speculation
is
successful
or
at
least
covered
up
many
men
prefer
to
take
a
chance
of
disgrace
or
punishment
or
death
rather
than
remain
poor
these
are
not
necessarily
dishonest
or
bad
they
may
be
more
venturesome
or
more
unfortunate
at
any
rate
it
is
obvious
that
the
passion
for
money
the
chance
to
get
it
the
dread
of
poverty
the
love
of
wealth
and
power
were
too
strong
for
their
equipment
otherwise
the
pressure
would
have
been
resisted
the
same
pressure
on
some
other
man
would
not
have
brought
disaster
the
restrictions
placed
around
the
accumulation
of
property
are
multiplying
faster
than
any
other
portions
of
the
criminal
code
it
takes
a
long
time
for
new
customs
or
habits
or
restraints
to
become
a
part
of
the
life
and
consciousness
of
man
so
that
the
mere
suggestion
of
the
act
causes
the
reaction
that
doing
it
is
wrong
no
matter
how
long
some
statutes
are
on
the
books
and
how
severe
the
penalties
many
men
never
believe
that
doing
the
forbidden
act
is
really
a
crime
for
instance
the
violations
of
many
revenue
laws
game
laws
prohibition
laws
and
many
laws
against
various
means
of
getting
property
are
often
considered
as
not
really
criminal
in
fact
a
large
and
probably
growing
class
of
men
disputes
the
justice
of
creating
many
legal
rules
in
reference
to
private
property
primitive
peoples
as
a
rule
held
property
in
common
their
inhibitions
were
few
and
simple
they
took
what
they
needed
and
wanted
in
the
easiest
way
there
is
a
strong
call
in
all
life
to
hark
back
to
primitive
feelings
customs
and
habits
many
new
laws
are
especially
painful
and
difficult
to
a
large
class
of
weak
men
who
form
the
bulk
of
our
criminal
class
to
understand
the
constant
urge
to
throw
off
the
shackles
of
civilization
one
need
but
think
of
the
number
of
men
who
use
liquor
or
drugs
one
need
only
look
at
the
professional
and
business
man
who
at
every
opportunity
leaves
civilization
and
goes
to
the
woods
to
kill
wild
animals
or
to
the
lakes
and
streams
to
fish
the
call
to
live
a
simple
life
free
from
the
conventions
customs
and
rules
to
kill
for
the
sake
of
killing
to
get
to
the
woods
and
streams
and
away
from
brick
buildings
and
stone
walls
is
strong
in
the
constitution
of
almost
every
man
probably
the
underlying
cause
of
the
world
war
was
the
need
of
man
to
relax
from
the
hard
and
growing
strain
of
the
civilization
that
is
continually
weaving
new
fetters
to
bind
him
there
must
always
come
a
breaking
point
for
after
all
man
is
an
animal
and
can
live
only
from
and
by
the
primitive
things
children
have
no
idea
of
the
rights
of
property
it
takes
long
and
patient
teaching
even
to
the
most
intelligent
to
make
them
feel
that
there
is
a
point
at
which
the
taking
of
property
is
wrong
nowhere
in
nature
can
we
see
an
analogy
to
our
property
rights
plants
and
animals
alike
get
their
sustenance
where
and
how
they
can
it
is
not
meant
here
to
discuss
the
question
of
how
many
of
the
restrictions
that
control
the
getting
of
property
are
wise
and
how
many
are
foolish
it
is
only
meant
to
give
the
facts
as
they
affect
life
and
conduct
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
child
learns
very
slowly
and
very
imperfectly
to
distinguish
the
ways
by
which
he
may
and
may
not
get
property
his
nature
always
protests
against
it
as
he
goes
along
only
a
few
can
ever
learn
it
in
anything
like
completeness
many
men
can
not
learn
it
and
if
they
learned
the
forbidden
things
they
would
have
no
feeling
that
to
disobey
was
wrong
even
the
most
intelligent
ones
never
know
or
feel
the
whole
code
and
in
fact
lawyers
are
forever
debating
and
judges
doubting
as
to
whether
many
ways
of
getting
property
are
inside
or
outside
the
law
no
doubt
many
of
the
methods
that
intelligent
and
respected
men
adopt
for
getting
property
have
more
inherent
criminality
than
others
that
are
directly
forbidden
by
the
law
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
all
laws
are
naturally
and
inevitably
evolved
by
the
strongest
force
in
a
community
and
in
the
last
analysis
made
for
the
protection
of
the
dominant
class
xv
attitude
of
the
criminal
probably
the
chief
barrier
to
the
commission
of
crime
is
the
feeling
of
right
and
wrong
connected
with
the
doing
or
not
doing
of
particular
acts
all
men
have
a
more
or
less
binding
conscience
this
is
the
result
of
long
teaching
and
habit
in
matters
of
conduct
most
people
are
taught
at
home
and
in
school
that
certain
things
are
right
and
that
others
are
wrong
this
constant
instruction
builds
up
habits
and
rules
of
conduct
and
it
is
mainly
upon
these
that
society
depends
for
the
behavior
of
its
citizens
to
most
men
conscience
is
the
monitor
rather
than
law
it
acts
more
automatically
and
a
shock
to
the
conscience
is
far
more
effective
than
the
knowledge
that
a
law
is
broken
for
the
most
part
the
promptings
of
conscience
follow
pretty
closely
the
inhibitions
of
the
criminal
code
although
they
may
or
may
not
follow
the
spirit
of
the
law
each
person
has
his
own
idea
of
the
relative
values
attached
to
human
actions
that
is
no
two
machines
respond
exactly
alike
as
to
the
relative
importance
of
different
things
no
two
ethical
commands
have
the
same
importance
to
all
people
or
to
any
two
people
often
men
do
not
hesitate
to
circumvent
or
violate
one
statute
when
they
could
never
be
even
tempted
to
violate
another
ordinarily
unless
the
response
of
conscience
is
quick
and
plain
men
are
not
bothered
by
the
infraction
of
the
law
except
perchance
by
the
fear
of
discovery
this
is
quite
apart
from
the
teaching
that
it
is
the
duty
of
all
men
to
obey
all
laws
a
proposition
so
general
that
it
has
no
effect
even
those
who
make
the
statement
do
not
follow
the
precept
and
the
long
list
of
penal
laws
that
die
from
lack
of
enforcement
instead
of
by
repeal
is
too
well
known
to
warrant
the
belief
that
anyone
pays
serious
attention
to
such
a
purely
academic
statement
no
one
believes
in
the
enforcement
of
all
laws
or
the
duty
to
obey
all
laws
and
no
one
in
fact
does
obey
them
all
those
who
proclaim
the
loudest
the
duty
of
obedience
to
all
laws
never
obey
for
example
the
revenue
laws
these
are
clear
and
explicit
and
yet
men
take
every
means
possible
to
have
their
property
exempted
from
taxation
in
other
words
to
defraud
the
state
this
is
done
on
the
excuse
that
everyone
else
does
it
and
the
man
who
makes
a
strict
return
according
to
law
would
pay
the
taxes
of
the
shirkers
while
this
is
true
it
simply
shows
that
all
men
violate
the
law
when
the
justification
seems
sufficient
to
them
the
laws
against
blasphemy
against
sunday
work
and
sunday
play
against
buying
and
transporting
intoxicating
liquors
and
smuggling
goods
are
freely
violated
many
laws
are
so
recent
that
they
have
not
grown
to
be
or
fixed
new
habits
and
their
violation
brings
no
moral
shock
in
spite
of
the
professions
often
made
most
men
have
a
poor
opinion
of
congressmen
and
legislators
and
feel
that
their
own
conscience
is
a
much
higher
guide
for
them
than
the
law
religions
have
always
taught
obedience
to
god
or
to
what
takes
his
place
religious
commands
and
feelings
are
higher
and
more
binding
on
man
than
human
law
the
captains
of
industry
are
forever
belittling
and
criticising
all
those
laws
made
by
legislatures
and
courts
which
interfere
with
the
unrestricted
use
of
property
none
of
this
sort
of
legislation
has
their
approval
and
the
courts
are
regarded
as
meddlesome
when
they
enforce
it
the
laws
the
laws
factory
legislation
of
all
kinds
anything
in
short
that
interferes
with
the
unrestricted
use
of
property
by
its
owner
are
roundly
condemned
and
violated
by
evasion
on
the
other
hand
so
much
has
been
written
and
said
in
reference
to
the
creation
of
the
fundamental
rights
to
own
property
and
these
rights
depend
so
absolutely
upon
social
arrangements
and
work
out
such
manifest
injustice
and
inequality
that
there
is
always
a
feeling
of
protest
against
many
of
our
property
laws
from
those
who
advocate
a
new
distribution
of
wealth
and
condemn
the
injustice
of
present
property
rights
the
step
is
quite
short
to
those
who
feel
the
injustice
and
put
their
ideas
in
force
by
taking
property
when
and
where
they
are
able
to
get
it
for
instance
a
miner
may
believe
that
the
corporation
for
which
he
works
really
has
no
right
to
the
gold
down
in
the
mine
as
he
is
digging
he
strikes
a
particularly
rich
pocket
of
ore
he
feels
that
he
does
no
wrong
if
he
appropriates
the
ore
elaborate
means
are
taken
to
prevent
this
even
compelling
the
absolute
stripping
of
the
workman
and
a
complete
change
of
clothes
on
going
in
and
coming
out
of
the
mine
many
laws
are
put
on
the
books
which
are
of
a
purely
sumptuary
nature
these
attempt
to
control
what
one
shall
do
in
his
own
personal
affairs
such
laws
are
brought
about
by
organizations
with
a
purpose
the
members
are
anxious
to
make
everyone
else
conform
to
their
ideas
and
habits
such
laws
as
sunday
laws
liquor
laws
and
the
like
are
examples
then
too
every
state
or
nation
carries
a
large
list
of
laws
that
men
have
so
long
violated
and
ignored
that
they
virtually
are
dead
to
violate
these
brings
no
feeling
of
wrong
but
only
serves
to
make
men
doubt
the
evil
of
violating
any
law
it
is
never
easy
to
get
a
legislature
to
repeal
a
law
generally
some
organization
or
committee
of
people
is
interested
in
keeping
it
alive
and
the
members
of
the
legislature
fear
losing
their
votes
social
ideas
are
always
changing
no
laws
or
customs
are
eternal
the
ordinary
man
and
especially
the
man
under
the
normal
can
not
keep
up
with
all
the
shifting
of
a
changing
world
there
is
always
a
fraction
of
a
community
agitating
for
something
new
and
gradually
forcing
the
legislature
to
put
it
into
law
even
against
the
will
of
the
majority
and
against
the
sentiment
of
a
large
class
of
the
community
the
organization
that
wants
something
done
is
always
aggressive
the
man
who
wants
to
prevent
it
from
being
done
is
seldom
unduly
active
or
even
alarmed
many
organizations
are
eager
to
get
statutes
on
the
books
one
seldom
hears
of
a
society
or
club
that
is
active
in
getting
laws
repealed
the
constant
change
of
law
the
constant
fixing
of
new
values
in
place
of
old
ones
is
necessary
to
social
life
this
means
putting
new
wine
into
old
bottles
and
wine
that
is
much
too
strong
for
the
bottles
everybody
can
see
why
some
particular
law
might
be
violated
without
a
sense
of
guilt
but
they
can
not
see
how
a
law
they
believe
in
can
be
violated
without
serious
obliquity
apart
from
this
there
have
always
been
crimes
that
were
not
of
the
class
that
implied
moral
wrong
the
acts
of
the
revolutionist
who
saw
or
thought
he
saw
visions
of
something
better
the
man
who
is
inspired
by
the
love
of
his
and
who
has
no
personal
ends
to
gain
the
man
who
in
his
devotion
to
an
idea
or
a
person
risks
his
life
or
liberty
or
property
or
reputation
has
never
been
classed
with
those
who
violate
the
law
for
selfish
ends
the
line
of
revolutionists
from
the
beginning
of
organized
government
down
to
the
birth
of
the
united
states
and
even
to
the
present
time
furnishes
ample
proof
of
this
and
still
the
unsuccessful
revolutionist
meets
with
the
severest
penalties
to
him
failure
generally
means
death
men
who
are
fired
with
zeal
for
all
new
causes
are
forever
running
foul
of
the
law
social
organization
like
biological
organization
is
conservative
all
things
that
live
are
imbued
with
the
will
to
live
and
they
take
all
means
in
their
power
to
go
on
living
the
philosopher
can
neither
quarrel
with
the
idealist
who
makes
the
sacrifice
nor
the
organization
that
preserves
itself
while
it
can
he
only
recognizes
what
is
true
men
have
always
been
obliged
to
fight
to
preserve
liberty
constitutions
and
laws
do
not
safeguard
liberty
it
can
be
preserved
only
by
a
tolerant
people
and
this
means
eternal
conflict
emerson
said
that
the
good
citizen
must
not
be
to
law
freedom
is
always
trampled
on
in
times
of
stress
the
united
states
suffered
serious
encroachments
on
liberty
during
the
civil
war
during
the
last
war
these
encroachments
were
greater
than
any
american
could
have
possibly
dreamed
and
so
far
there
seems
little
immediate
chance
for
change
still
the
philosopher
does
not
complain
he
sees
human
passion
for
what
it
is
a
great
emotion
that
holds
men
in
its
grasp
a
feeling
that
nothing
can
stand
against
opposition
is
destroyed
by
force
and
often
blind
cruel
unreasoning
force
sometimes
even
worse
this
force
is
created
for
selfish
ends
there
are
always
those
who
will
use
the
strongest
and
highest
emotions
of
men
to
serve
their
private
sordid
ends
changing
social
systems
new
political
ideas
the
labor
cause
all
movements
for
religious
social
or
political
change
have
their
zealots
they
are
met
by
the
force
of
convention
and
conservatism
ready
to
defend
itself
and
the
clash
is
inevitable
it
is
easy
to
distinguish
this
sort
of
action
from
the
things
done
by
those
who
are
known
as
criminals
their
acts
are
done
to
serve
personal
ends
society
may
always
punish
both
but
all
men
of
right
ideas
will
understand
that
the
motive
is
different
the
equipment
and
capacity
of
the
men
are
different
and
they
are
only
in
the
same
class
because
they
each
violate
the
law
and
are
each
responsive
to
emotions
and
to
feelings
that
are
of
sufficient
strength
to
compel
action
xvi
the
law
and
the
criminal
if
one
were
ill
with
a
specific
disease
and
he
were
sent
to
a
hospital
every
person
who
touched
him
from
the
time
his
disease
was
known
until
he
was
discharged
would
use
all
possible
effort
to
bring
him
back
to
health
physiology
and
psychology
alike
would
be
used
to
effect
a
cure
not
only
would
he
be
given
surroundings
for
regaining
health
and
ample
physical
treatment
but
he
would
be
helped
by
appeals
in
the
way
of
praise
and
encouragement
even
to
the
extent
of
downright
falsehood
about
his
condition
to
aid
in
his
recovery
if
such
is
done
of
disease
why
not
of
crime
not
only
is
it
clear
that
crime
is
a
disease
whose
root
is
in
heredity
and
environment
but
it
is
clear
that
with
most
men
at
least
when
young
by
improving
environment
or
adding
to
knowledge
and
experience
it
is
curable
still
with
the
unfortunate
accused
of
crimes
or
misdemeanors
from
the
moment
the
attention
of
the
officers
is
drawn
to
him
until
his
final
destruction
everything
is
done
to
prevent
his
recovery
and
to
aggravate
and
make
fatal
his
disease
the
young
boy
of
the
congested
districts
who
tries
to
indulge
his
normal
impulses
for
play
is
driven
from
every
vacant
lot
he
is
forbidden
normal
activity
by
the
police
he
has
no
place
of
his
own
he
grows
to
regard
all
officers
as
his
enemies
instead
of
his
friends
he
is
taken
into
court
where
the
most
judge
lectures
him
about
his
duties
to
his
parents
and
threatens
him
with
the
dire
evils
that
the
future
holds
in
store
for
him
unless
he
reforms
if
he
is
released
nothing
is
done
by
society
to
give
him
a
better
environment
where
he
can
succeed
he
is
turned
out
with
his
old
comrades
and
into
his
old
life
and
is
then
supposed
by
strength
of
will
to
overcome
these
surroundings
a
thing
which
can
be
done
by
no
person
however
strong
he
may
be
for
the
graver
things
the
boy
or
man
is
taken
to
the
police
station
there
he
is
photographed
and
his
name
and
family
record
taken
down
even
before
he
has
had
a
hearing
or
a
trial
he
is
handled
by
officers
who
may
do
the
best
they
can
but
who
by
training
and
experience
and
for
lack
of
time
and
facilities
are
not
fitted
for
their
important
positions
i
say
this
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
my
experience
has
taught
me
that
policemen
as
a
rule
are
kindly
and
human
from
the
police
station
the
offender
is
lodged
in
jail
here
is
huddled
together
a
great
mass
of
human
wreckage
a
large
part
of
it
being
the
product
of
imperfect
heredities
acted
upon
by
impossible
environments
however
short
the
time
he
stays
and
however
wide
his
experience
the
first
offender
learns
things
he
never
knew
before
and
takes
another
degree
in
the
life
that
an
evil
destiny
has
prepared
for
him
in
the
jail
he
is
fed
much
like
the
animals
in
the
zoo
in
many
prisons
the
jailer
is
making
what
money
he
can
by
the
amount
he
can
save
on
each
prisoner
he
feeds
above
the
rate
the
law
allows
of
or
fifty
cents
a
day
in
a
short
time
the
prisoner
misery
and
grief
turn
to
bitterness
and
hate
hatred
of
jailer
of
officers
of
society
of
existing
things
of
the
fate
that
overshadows
his
life
there
is
only
one
thing
that
offers
him
opportunity
and
that
is
a
life
of
crime
he
is
indicted
and
prosecuted
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
equipped
with
money
and
provided
with
ample
detectives
and
assistants
to
make
it
impossible
for
the
prisoner
to
escape
everyone
believes
him
guilty
from
the
time
of
his
arrest
the
black
marks
of
his
life
have
been
recorded
at
schools
in
police
stations
and
examining
courts
the
good
marks
are
not
there
and
would
not
be
competent
evidence
if
they
were
theoretically
the
attorney
is
as
much
bound
to
protect
him
as
to
prosecute
him
but
the
state
attorney
has
the
psychology
that
leads
to
a
belief
of
guilt
and
when
he
forms
that
belief
his
duty
follows
which
is
to
land
the
victim
in
prison
it
is
not
only
his
duty
to
land
him
in
jail
but
the
office
of
the
state
attorney
is
usually
a
to
something
else
and
he
must
make
a
record
and
be
talked
about
the
public
is
interested
only
in
sending
bad
folks
to
jail
no
doubt
there
are
very
few
state
attorneys
who
would
knowingly
prosecute
unless
they
believed
a
man
guilty
of
the
offense
but
it
is
easy
for
a
state
attorney
to
believe
in
guilt
every
man
daily
life
is
largely
made
up
of
acts
from
which
a
presumption
of
either
guilt
or
innocence
can
be
inferred
depending
upon
the
attitude
of
the
one
who
draws
the
inference
to
a
state
attorney
or
his
assistants
the
case
is
one
that
he
should
win
all
cases
should
be
won
even
though
he
means
to
be
fair
his
psychology
is
to
win
no
lawyer
interested
in
a
result
can
be
fair
the
lawyer
is
an
advocate
trying
to
show
that
his
side
is
right
and
trying
to
win
the
case
the
fact
that
he
represents
the
state
makes
no
difference
in
his
psychology
in
fact
he
always
tells
the
jury
that
he
represents
the
state
and
is
as
much
interested
in
protecting
the
defendant
as
in
protecting
society
he
does
this
so
that
the
jury
will
give
his
statements
more
weight
than
the
statements
of
the
lawyer
for
the
defense
and
this
very
remark
gives
him
an
advantage
that
is
neither
fair
nor
right
the
man
on
trial
is
almost
always
poor
it
is
only
rarely
that
a
poor
man
can
get
a
competent
lawyer
to
take
his
case
he
is
often
handed
over
to
the
court
for
the
appointment
of
a
lawyer
the
lawyer
has
no
time
or
money
to
prepare
a
defense
as
a
rule
he
is
a
beginner
not
fitted
for
his
job
if
he
wishes
to
take
the
case
he
wants
it
only
for
the
experience
and
advertising
that
it
will
bring
he
is
handed
a
case
to
experiment
on
just
as
a
medical
student
is
handed
a
cadaver
to
dissect
if
the
defendant
is
in
jail
he
has
little
chance
to
prepare
his
case
if
the
defendant
had
any
money
he
would
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
he
is
often
a
mentally
defective
person
his
friends
are
of
the
same
class
and
can
do
little
to
help
him
the
jury
are
told
that
they
must
presume
him
innocent
but
the
accusation
alone
carries
with
it
the
presumption
of
guilt
which
extends
to
everyone
connected
with
the
case
even
to
the
lawyer
appointed
to
defend
him
it
is
almost
a
miracle
if
the
defendant
is
not
convicted
perhaps
he
is
taken
out
to
be
hanged
the
last
act
that
society
can
do
for
him
or
the
convicted
man
is
sent
to
prison
for
a
long
or
shorter
term
his
head
is
shaved
and
he
is
placed
in
prison
garb
he
is
carefully
measured
and
photographed
in
his
prison
clothes
so
that
if
he
should
ever
get
back
to
the
world
he
will
forever
be
under
suspicion
even
a
change
of
name
can
not
help
him
while
in
prison
he
works
and
lives
under
lock
and
key
like
a
wild
animal
eager
to
escape
on
certain
days
he
is
allowed
to
sit
at
a
long
table
with
other
unfortunates
like
himself
and
visit
for
an
hour
with
mother
or
father
or
wife
or
son
or
daughter
or
friend
on
the
other
side
other
prisoners
so
far
as
he
can
associate
with
them
are
as
helpless
and
hopeless
and
rebellious
as
he
how
they
will
get
out
and
when
are
their
chief
concerns
many
of
their
guards
are
very
humane
probably
no
one
seeks
to
torture
him
but
the
system
and
the
psychology
are
fatal
he
sees
almost
no
one
who
approaches
him
with
friendship
and
trust
and
a
desire
to
help
except
his
family
his
closest
friends
and
his
companions
in
misery
he
knows
that
the
length
of
his
term
is
entirely
dependent
upon
officials
whom
he
can
not
see
or
make
understand
his
case
he
snatches
at
the
slightest
ray
of
hope
he
is
in
despair
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
no
prison
has
the
trained
men
who
with
intelligence
and
sympathy
should
know
and
watch
and
help
him
in
his
plight
no
state
would
spend
the
money
necessary
to
employ
enough
attendants
and
aids
with
the
learning
and
skill
necessary
to
build
him
up
money
is
freely
spent
on
the
prosecution
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
but
no
effort
is
made
to
help
or
save
the
motto
of
the
state
is
millions
for
offense
but
not
one
cent
for
reclamation
as
all
things
end
prison
sentences
are
generally
finished
the
prisoner
is
given
a
new
suit
of
clothes
that
betrays
its
origin
and
will
be
useless
after
the
first
rain
ten
dollars
in
cash
and
he
goes
out
his
heredity
and
his
hard
environment
have
put
him
in
now
the
state
is
done
with
him
he
is
free
but
there
is
only
one
place
to
go
like
any
other
released
animal
he
takes
the
same
heredity
back
to
the
old
environment
what
else
can
he
do
his
old
companions
are
the
only
ones
who
will
give
him
social
intercourse
which
he
needs
first
of
all
and
the
only
ones
who
understand
him
they
are
the
only
ones
who
will
be
glad
to
see
him
and
help
him
get
a
job
there
is
only
one
profession
for
which
he
is
better
fitted
after
he
comes
out
than
he
was
before
he
went
in
and
that
is
a
life
of
crime
of
course
he
is
a
marked
man
and
a
watched
man
with
the
police
when
a
crime
is
committed
and
the
offender
is
not
found
the
is
rounded
up
with
others
of
his
class
to
see
perchance
if
he
is
not
the
offender
that
is
wanted
he
is
taken
to
the
and
shown
with
others
to
the
witnesses
for
identification
before
this
the
witness
may
have
been
shown
his
photograph
in
convict
clothes
perhaps
they
identify
him
perhaps
they
do
not
if
identified
he
may
be
the
man
or
he
may
not
be
anyhow
he
has
been
in
prison
and
this
is
against
him
whenever
he
comes
out
and
wherever
he
goes
his
record
follows
him
as
closely
as
his
shadow
even
his
friends
suspect
him
they
suspect
him
even
when
they
help
him
such
is
the
daily
life
of
these
unfortunates
what
can
be
done
i
can
see
nothing
that
the
officers
of
the
law
can
do
officers
represent
the
people
they
reflect
mob
psychology
even
though
an
officer
here
and
there
rises
above
the
crowd
as
he
sometimes
does
it
is
of
no
avail
his
place
soon
is
filled
by
someone
else
if
only
the
public
would
understand
if
only
the
public
were
more
intelligent
which
in
this
case
at
least
would
mean
more
human
if
only
the
statement
i
repeat
so
often
could
be
understood
there
are
no
accidents
everything
is
the
result
of
law
all
phenomena
are
a
succession
of
causes
and
effects
the
criminal
is
the
result
of
all
that
went
before
him
and
all
that
surrounds
him
like
every
other
mortal
he
is
a
subject
for
pity
and
not
for
hatred
if
society
is
not
safe
while
he
is
at
large
he
must
be
confined
and
kept
under
guard
and
observation
he
must
be
kept
until
he
is
safe
and
a
favorable
environment
found
for
him
if
he
will
never
be
safe
for
society
he
should
never
be
released
he
must
not
be
humiliated
made
to
suffer
unduly
despised
or
harried
he
must
be
helped
if
he
can
be
helped
this
should
be
the
second
if
not
the
first
object
of
his
confinement
assuming
that
the
scientific
attitude
toward
crime
should
be
accepted
by
those
who
make
public
opinion
and
that
this
should
become
crystallized
into
written
law
the
problem
would
be
easy
the
officers
of
the
state
can
as
a
rule
be
depended
upon
to
deal
properly
and
considerately
with
the
known
insane
the
insane
are
more
trying
and
difficult
than
the
criminal
courts
and
juries
and
the
public
however
recognize
their
mental
condition
and
do
not
visit
them
with
vengeance
it
is
appreciated
and
understood
that
they
can
not
with
safety
be
left
at
large
but
they
are
given
the
care
and
consideration
that
their
condition
demands
if
the
criminal
should
be
looked
upon
as
are
the
creatures
insane
from
natural
causes
the
state
attorney
could
then
be
trusted
to
prepare
the
case
and
do
the
best
he
could
for
all
concerned
the
defendant
would
no
longer
be
a
defendant
his
case
would
be
under
investigation
his
past
life
would
be
shown
his
credits
as
well
as
his
debits
he
would
need
no
lawyer
not
even
a
public
defender
no
jury
would
be
required
and
the
uncertainties
and
doubts
that
hang
around
judgments
would
be
removed
there
would
be
little
chance
for
a
miscarriage
of
justice
even
should
there
be
it
would
result
in
the
speedy
release
of
one
against
whom
the
public
bore
no
one
who
was
sick
or
insane
would
ordinarily
not
need
a
lawyer
as
the
state
would
bear
him
no
malice
and
make
no
effort
to
do
more
than
investigate
the
case
and
present
the
facts
the
whole
matter
should
be
a
purely
scientific
attempt
to
find
out
the
best
thing
to
be
done
both
for
the
interest
of
the
public
and
the
interest
of
the
man
no
doubt
in
many
cases
men
are
convicted
who
are
perfectly
innocent
of
the
crime
of
which
they
are
accused
this
is
especially
true
with
the
poor
who
can
provide
for
no
adequate
defense
and
who
perhaps
have
been
convicted
before
of
some
misdemeanor
or
crime
this
is
also
often
true
in
cases
where
there
is
great
prejudice
against
the
defendant
either
on
account
of
the
nature
of
the
case
or
of
the
defendant
on
trial
for
instance
during
the
recent
war
a
wave
of
hysteria
swept
over
the
world
and
courts
and
juries
trampled
on
individual
rights
and
freely
violated
the
spirit
of
laws
and
constitutions
the
close
of
the
war
left
the
same
intense
feelings
of
bitterness
which
made
justice
impossible
in
cases
where
the
charge
savored
of
treason
and
involved
criticism
of
the
government
or
advocacy
of
a
change
of
political
systems
questions
of
race
religion
politics
labor
and
the
like
have
always
awakened
violent
feelings
on
all
sides
have
made
bitter
partisans
and
strict
lines
of
cleavage
and
have
made
verdicts
of
juries
and
judgments
of
courts
the
result
of
fear
and
hatred
in
spite
of
this
most
of
the
inmates
of
prisons
have
done
the
acts
charged
in
the
indictments
why
they
did
them
their
states
of
mind
the
conditions
and
circumstances
surrounding
them
what
can
be
done
to
make
them
stronger
and
better
able
to
meet
life
are
never
ascertained
and
few
courts
or
juries
have
ever
deemed
these
things
proper
subjects
for
consideration
or
in
any
way
involved
in
the
case
in
law
every
crime
consists
of
two
things
an
act
and
an
intent
both
are
necessary
to
constitute
legal
guilt
and
on
the
prevalent
theory
of
moral
guilt
and
punishment
both
are
necessary
to
make
up
criminal
conduct
there
can
be
no
legal
or
moral
guilt
unless
one
intends
wickedness
unless
he
deliberately
does
the
act
because
he
wishes
to
do
wrong
and
knows
he
does
wrong
the
question
then
of
moral
guilt
which
is
necessary
to
the
commission
of
a
criminal
act
touches
all
the
questions
suggested
and
many
more
even
if
freedom
of
action
is
to
some
degree
assumed
the
question
still
remains
as
to
the
degree
of
guilt
in
fixing
punishment
and
responsibility
the
question
involves
the
of
the
man
his
full
heredity
so
far
as
it
can
be
known
most
of
every
man
heredity
is
hidden
in
the
mist
and
darkness
of
the
past
he
inherits
more
or
less
directly
through
an
infinite
number
of
ancestors
reaching
back
to
primitive
man
and
even
to
the
animals
from
which
he
came
the
remote
ancestry
is
of
course
usually
not
so
important
as
that
immediately
behind
him
still
plainly
his
form
and
structure
and
the
details
of
his
whole
machine
including
the
marvelously
delicate
mechanism
of
the
brain
and
nervous
system
are
heritages
of
the
very
ancient
past
neither
are
the
processes
of
inheritance
well
understood
nor
subject
to
much
control
often
in
the
making
of
the
man
nature
resorts
to
some
which
reproduces
the
ancient
heritage
this
can
be
seen
only
in
general
resemblances
and
behavior
for
the
genealogical
tree
of
any
family
is
very
short
and
very
imperfectly
known
and
the
poor
have
no
past
in
three
or
four
generations
at
the
most
the
backward
trail
is
lost
and
his
family
merged
with
the
species
of
which
he
forms
but
a
humble
part
enough
however
is
known
of
ancestry
and
the
infinite
marks
of
inheritance
on
every
structure
as
well
as
enough
of
the
reaction
of
the
human
machine
to
the
varied
environment
that
surrounds
it
to
make
it
clear
that
if
one
were
and
he
could
account
in
advance
for
every
action
of
every
man
more
than
this
he
could
see
in
the
original
fertilized
cell
all
its
powers
defects
and
potentialities
and
could
in
the
same
manner
look
down
through
the
short
years
during
which
the
human
organism
grown
from
the
cell
shall
have
life
and
movement
and
could
see
its
varied
environment
if
one
could
see
this
with
infinite
wisdom
he
could
infallibly
tell
in
advance
each
step
that
the
machine
would
take
and
infallibly
predict
the
time
and
method
of
its
dissolution
to
be
is
to
be
and
this
is
infinitely
better
than
to
be
to
get
this
knowledge
of
the
past
of
each
machine
is
the
duty
and
work
of
the
tribunal
that
passes
on
the
fate
of
a
man
it
can
be
done
only
imperfectly
at
best
the
law
furnishes
no
means
of
making
these
judgments
all
it
furnishes
is
a
tribunal
where
the
contending
lawyers
can
fight
not
for
justice
but
to
win
it
is
little
better
than
the
old
wager
of
battle
where
the
parties
hired
fighters
and
the
issue
was
settled
with
swords
oftentimes
the
only
question
settled
in
court
is
the
relative
strength
and
cunning
of
the
lawyers
the
tribunal
whose
duty
it
is
to
fix
the
future
place
and
status
of
its
fellowmen
should
be
wise
learned
scientific
patient
and
humane
it
should
take
the
time
and
make
its
own
investigation
and
it
can
be
well
done
in
no
other
way
when
public
opinion
accepts
the
belief
that
punishment
is
only
cruelty
that
conduct
is
a
result
of
causes
and
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
moral
guilt
investigations
and
sorting
and
placing
of
the
unfortunate
can
be
done
fairly
well
the
mistakes
will
be
very
few
and
easily
corrected
when
discovered
there
will
be
no
cruelty
and
suffering
the
community
will
be
protected
and
the
individual
saved
neither
will
this
task
be
so
great
as
it
might
seem
at
first
glance
trials
would
probably
be
much
shorter
than
the
endless
senseless
bickering
in
courts
the
long
time
wasted
in
selecting
juries
and
the
many
irrelevant
issues
on
which
guilt
or
innocence
are
often
determined
make
necessary
now
most
of
the
criminal
cases
would
likewise
be
prevented
if
the
state
would
undertake
to
improve
the
general
social
and
economic
condition
of
those
who
get
the
least
only
a
fraction
of
the
money
spent
in
human
destruction
in
war
and
out
would
give
an
education
adapted
to
the
individual
even
to
the
most
defective
it
would
make
life
easy
by
making
the
environment
easy
only
a
few
of
the
defective
physically
and
mentally
would
be
left
for
courts
to
place
in
an
environment
where
both
they
and
society
could
live
perhaps
some
time
this
work
will
be
seriously
taken
up
until
then
we
shall
muddle
along
fixing
and
changing
and
punishing
and
destroying
we
will
follow
the
old
course
of
the
ages
which
has
no
purpose
method
or
end
and
leaves
only
infinite
suffering
in
its
path
xvii
repealing
laws
it
is
comparatively
easy
to
get
a
penal
statute
on
the
books
it
is
very
hard
to
get
it
repealed
men
are
lazy
and
cowardly
politicians
look
for
votes
members
of
legislatures
and
congress
are
not
so
much
interested
in
finding
out
what
should
be
done
as
they
are
in
finding
out
what
the
public
thinks
should
be
done
often
a
law
lingers
on
the
books
long
after
the
people
no
longer
believing
the
forbidden
thing
to
be
wrong
have
repealed
it
the
statute
stays
to
be
used
by
mischievous
people
and
by
those
who
believe
in
the
particular
law
often
the
unthinking
lay
hold
of
a
or
a
pet
phrase
and
repeat
and
write
it
as
if
it
were
the
last
word
in
social
science
and
philosophy
general
grant
when
president
stumbled
on
such
a
silly
combination
of
words
and
have
been
repeating
it
ever
since
simply
because
it
sounds
wise
and
pat
grant
once
said
that
the
way
to
repeal
a
bad
law
is
to
enforce
it
grant
was
not
a
statesman
nor
a
philosopher
he
was
a
soldier
he
probably
heard
some
one
use
this
phrase
and
it
sounded
good
to
him
out
of
that
has
grown
the
further
statement
which
courts
and
prosecutors
have
used
to
excuse
themselves
for
the
cruelty
of
enforcing
a
law
that
does
violence
to
the
feelings
of
the
people
this
statement
is
to
the
effect
that
so
long
as
the
law
is
on
the
books
it
is
the
duty
of
officers
to
enforce
it
the
smallest
investigation
of
the
philosophy
of
law
shows
how
silly
and
reactionary
such
statements
are
one
thing
should
be
remembered
laws
really
come
from
the
habits
customs
and
feelings
of
the
people
as
interpreted
or
understood
by
legislative
bodies
when
these
habits
and
customs
are
old
enough
they
become
the
of
the
people
legislatures
and
courts
only
write
them
down
when
the
change
the
laws
change
even
though
no
legislature
or
judge
has
recorded
their
repeal
since
professor
sumner
of
yale
university
wrote
his
important
book
there
is
no
excuse
for
any
student
not
knowing
that
this
statement
is
true
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
court
ever
enforced
all
the
written
laws
or
ever
would
or
ever
could
only
a
part
of
the
discarded
criminal
law
is
ever
repealed
by
other
laws
the
rest
dies
from
neglect
and
lack
of
use
it
is
like
the
rudimentary
parts
of
the
human
anatomy
man
body
is
filled
with
rudimentary
muscles
and
nerves
that
in
the
past
served
a
purpose
these
were
never
removed
by
operations
but
died
from
disuse
every
criminal
code
is
filled
with
obsolete
laws
some
of
them
entirely
dead
others
in
the
course
of
dissolution
they
can
not
be
repealed
by
statute
so
long
as
an
active
minority
insists
that
they
remain
on
the
books
when
the
great
mass
no
longer
wants
them
it
is
useless
to
take
the
trouble
to
repeal
them
the
fugitive
slave
law
was
never
believed
in
and
never
obeyed
and
it
was
openly
violated
and
defied
by
the
great
mass
of
the
people
of
the
north
the
fourteenth
and
fifteenth
amendments
to
the
federal
constitution
and
the
statutes
passed
to
enforce
them
providing
political
and
civil
equality
for
the
black
man
and
forbidding
discrimination
on
railroads
in
hotels
restaurants
theatres
and
all
public
places
have
never
really
been
the
law
in
any
state
in
the
union
their
provisions
have
always
been
openly
violated
and
no
court
would
think
of
enforcing
them
for
the
simple
reason
that
public
sentiment
is
against
it
laws
condemning
witchcraft
and
sorcery
both
in
europe
and
america
did
their
deadly
work
and
died
for
the
most
part
without
repeal
sabbath
laws
of
all
sorts
forbidding
work
and
play
and
amusements
are
dead
letters
on
the
statute
books
of
most
states
in
spite
of
many
attempts
to
galvanize
them
into
life
all
kinds
of
revenue
laws
are
openly
violated
most
of
intelligence
who
own
property
violate
the
revenue
law
openly
and
notoriously
and
all
courts
and
officers
as
well
as
the
public
know
it
many
laws
which
interfere
with
the
habits
customs
and
beliefs
of
a
large
number
of
people
like
the
prohibition
laws
never
receive
the
assent
of
so
large
a
percentage
as
to
make
people
conscious
of
any
wrong
in
violating
them
and
therefore
people
break
them
when
they
can
often
this
class
of
laws
is
enforced
upon
offenders
who
believe
the
law
is
an
unwarrantable
interference
with
their
rights
and
thus
causes
convictions
where
no
moral
turpitude
is
felt
every
new
crusade
against
crime
not
only
sweeps
away
a
large
amount
of
work
that
has
been
slowly
and
patiently
done
toward
a
right
understanding
of
crime
but
likewise
puts
new
statutes
on
the
books
which
would
not
be
placed
there
if
the
public
were
sane
when
it
does
not
do
this
it
increases
penalties
which
work
evil
in
other
directions
and
awe
courts
juries
governors
and
pardon
boards
not
only
preventing
them
from
listening
to
the
voice
of
humanity
and
justice
but
causing
them
to
deny
substantial
rights
and
wreak
vengeance
and
cruelty
upon
the
weak
and
helpless
xviii
is
crime
increasing
the
question
is
often
asked
is
crime
increasing
statistics
of
all
kinds
can
be
gathered
on
this
subject
in
the
main
they
seem
to
show
that
crime
is
on
the
increase
in
most
civilized
countries
it
is
very
unsafe
to
use
statistics
without
at
the
same
time
considering
all
the
questions
on
which
conduct
rests
an
increase
of
crime
as
shown
by
statistics
may
mean
that
the
records
are
kept
more
completely
than
in
former
times
it
may
mean
temporary
causes
like
bad
times
are
adding
to
the
number
of
arrests
and
convictions
it
may
mean
new
classifications
it
may
mean
that
figures
are
based
on
arrests
instead
of
convictions
it
may
include
misdemeanors
with
graver
offenses
it
may
or
may
not
include
repeaters
statistics
in
any
field
are
useful
but
usually
for
broad
generalizations
and
they
must
always
be
interpreted
by
men
of
experience
who
are
not
interested
in
the
results
still
on
the
whole
it
is
probable
that
statistics
show
that
crime
is
on
the
increase
what
have
reason
and
human
experience
to
say
on
the
subject
we
should
always
bear
in
mind
that
crime
can
never
mean
anything
except
the
violation
of
law
when
the
violator
is
convicted
that
it
has
no
necessary
reference
to
the
general
moral
condition
of
man
is
the
number
of
criminal
convictions
growing
and
if
so
why
in
the
first
place
the
criminal
code
is
lengthening
every
year
when
civilized
man
began
making
criminal
codes
there
were
comparatively
few
things
forbidden
the
codes
were
largely
made
up
of
those
acts
which
in
some
form
have
for
ages
been
generally
thought
to
be
criminal
religious
beliefs
customs
and
habits
were
included
in
the
penal
statutes
so
were
such
things
as
sorcery
and
witchcraft
property
was
then
not
an
important
subject
in
man
activities
when
the
instinct
to
create
and
accumulate
property
began
to
rule
life
the
criminal
code
grew
very
rapidly
complex
business
interests
combined
with
the
constantly
increasing
value
placed
on
property
were
always
calling
for
new
statutes
the
same
tendency
indirectly
demanded
still
other
statutes
until
at
the
present
time
this
class
of
crimes
makes
up
a
large
part
of
the
criminal
code
and
is
growing
steadily
each
year
then
too
the
necessity
of
property
has
called
for
the
violation
of
this
part
of
the
criminal
code
more
than
any
other
and
it
has
naturally
caused
a
considerable
increase
of
crime
man
in
his
social
and
political
activities
is
ever
weaving
and
bending
and
twisting
back
and
forth
for
a
number
of
years
the
universal
tendency
especially
in
america
has
been
toward
what
is
called
social
control
the
idea
being
that
more
and
more
people
should
be
controlled
in
an
increasing
number
of
ways
of
course
if
people
are
to
be
controlled
they
must
be
controlled
by
other
people
this
policy
has
been
extended
until
we
are
ever
pushing
further
into
the
regulation
of
the
habits
customs
and
lives
of
all
the
individual
members
of
the
community
the
majority
when
it
has
the
power
has
never
hesitated
to
force
its
ways
of
living
its
ideas
customs
and
habits
on
the
minority
the
majority
when
strong
enough
has
always
assumed
that
it
was
right
and
provided
that
others
must
live
its
way
or
not
at
all
the
pendulum
is
now
swinging
far
this
way
as
is
evidenced
by
prohibition
the
persistent
campaign
for
sunday
laws
and
the
growing
belief
in
social
control
as
a
means
of
changing
and
directing
humanity
this
has
added
to
the
criminal
code
and
has
increased
the
number
of
men
in
prisons
two
statutes
of
recent
date
in
most
of
the
states
are
responsible
for
a
very
large
increase
in
the
number
of
convicts
the
conspiracy
statute
which
is
used
today
is
a
deliberate
scheme
on
the
part
of
prosecutors
to
get
men
into
the
penitentiary
by
charging
an
agreement
or
confederation
of
two
or
more
persons
to
do
something
which
if
really
committed
would
be
a
misdemeanor
or
no
crime
whatever
under
this
charge
whether
made
specifically
or
in
connection
with
another
crime
the
rules
of
evidence
have
been
opened
and
relaxed
until
the
wildest
and
most
remote
hearsay
is
freely
admitted
for
the
plain
purpose
of
convicting
men
who
have
really
been
guilty
of
no
specific
act
it
is
in
effect
punishing
one
for
his
thoughts
the
business
of
the
court
or
jury
being
to
find
out
whether
in
some
particular
he
has
an
evil
mind
the
statute
forbidding
the
use
of
the
confidence
game
in
obtaining
property
sends
to
prison
a
constant
stream
of
persons
who
until
a
few
years
ago
would
have
been
guilty
of
no
crime
this
law
as
interpreted
by
the
courts
really
means
the
procuring
of
money
by
dishonest
means
under
this
statute
the
court
and
jury
hear
the
evidence
and
say
whether
the
means
charged
are
dishonest
or
not
this
of
course
leaves
the
law
so
that
the
temporarily
prevailing
power
perhaps
only
the
prosecuting
attorney
may
send
men
to
prison
who
take
means
of
getting
money
that
are
not
practiced
or
at
least
advocated
by
the
ones
who
procure
the
passage
and
enforcement
of
the
law
numberless
ways
used
by
the
strong
to
get
money
are
considered
dishonest
by
a
large
class
of
men
and
women
exaggerated
and
lying
advertisements
forestalling
the
markets
the
acts
and
wiles
of
the
professional
salesman
misrepresenting
goods
and
other
methods
that
could
never
be
catalogued
because
new
ways
are
constantly
coming
to
light
the
logical
end
of
all
these
indefinite
and
uncertain
laws
is
to
pass
one
statute
providing
that
whoever
does
wrong
shall
be
imprisoned
cetera
et
the
law
never
can
specify
all
the
ways
of
doing
wrong
and
many
of
the
meanest
and
most
annoying
things
have
never
been
and
from
the
nature
of
things
never
can
be
prohibited
by
the
statutes
no
man
is
a
good
citizen
a
good
neighbor
a
good
friend
or
a
good
man
just
because
he
obeys
the
law
the
intrinsic
worth
is
determined
mainly
by
the
intrinsic
civilization
is
all
the
while
making
it
harder
for
men
to
keep
out
of
prison
especially
do
the
weak
and
ignorant
and
poor
find
that
environment
is
constantly
creating
more
inhibitions
as
time
goes
on
while
rules
and
customs
are
prohibiting
more
and
more
ways
of
getting
property
the
needs
growing
out
of
civilization
are
always
increasing
the
simple
inexpensive
life
of
the
past
has
given
place
to
a
more
complex
way
of
living
which
calls
for
greater
expense
and
harder
work
it
has
created
rivalry
and
jealousy
to
get
the
things
that
others
have
and
has
placed
men
in
a
mad
race
with
each
other
which
often
leads
to
jail
or
death
students
of
biology
are
constantly
noting
the
difficulty
that
hereditary
human
traits
which
have
been
evolved
for
simple
reactions
and
plain
living
find
in
making
the
necessary
adjustments
to
the
extravagant
demands
and
complicated
environment
of
the
present
day
this
departure
from
the
old
normal
and
simple
environment
due
largely
to
machinery
and
commerce
is
not
only
destroying
individual
lives
by
the
thousands
but
is
seriously
threatening
the
whole
social
fabric
the
creation
of
new
courts
like
boys
courts
juvenile
courts
courts
of
domestic
relations
moral
courts
with
their
array
of
social
workers
parole
agents
watchers
cetera
shows
the
growth
of
crime
and
likewise
the
hopelessness
of
present
methods
to
deal
effectively
with
a
great
social
question
numbers
of
people
in
our
big
cities
are
making
their
living
from
the
abnormal
lives
of
children
whether
they
are
doing
good
or
not
or
whether
their
service
is
unselfish
as
much
of
it
doubtless
is
are
both
quite
aside
from
the
question
the
important
fact
is
that
the
present
system
brings
no
results
and
that
the
disease
is
growing
instead
of
any
considerable
number
of
people
taking
hold
of
the
question
of
crime
as
physicians
have
taken
hold
of
disease
and
seeking
to
find
its
cause
and
to
remove
that
cause
we
content
ourselves
with
prosecuting
and
punishing
and
visiting
with
misery
and
shame
not
only
the
boys
and
girls
the
men
and
women
who
are
the
victims
of
life
but
the
large
number
of
fathers
mothers
brothers
sisters
sons
and
daughters
whose
lives
are
ruined
by
a
catastrophe
with
which
at
least
they
had
nothing
to
do
if
a
doctor
were
called
in
to
treat
a
case
of
typhoid
fever
he
would
probably
find
out
where
the
patient
got
his
milk
supply
and
his
drinking
water
and
would
have
the
well
cleaned
out
to
stop
the
spread
of
typhoid
fever
through
infection
a
lawyer
called
to
treat
the
same
kind
of
a
case
legally
speaking
would
give
the
patient
thirty
days
in
jail
thinking
that
this
treatment
would
effect
a
cure
if
at
the
end
of
ten
days
the
patient
were
cured
he
would
nevertheless
be
kept
in
prison
until
his
time
was
out
if
at
the
end
of
thirty
days
the
disease
was
more
infectious
than
ever
the
patient
would
be
discharged
and
sent
upon
his
way
to
spread
contagion
in
his
path
the
transgression
of
organized
society
in
the
treatment
of
crime
would
not
be
so
great
if
students
and
scientists
had
not
long
since
found
the
cause
of
crime
it
would
be
hard
to
name
a
single
man
among
all
the
men
of
europe
and
america
who
have
given
their
time
and
thought
to
the
solution
of
this
problem
who
has
not
come
to
the
conclusion
that
crime
has
a
natural
origin
and
that
the
criminal
for
the
most
part
is
the
victim
of
heredity
and
environment
these
students
have
pointed
the
way
for
the
treatment
of
the
disease
and
yet
organized
government
that
spends
its
millions
on
prosecutions
reformatories
jails
penitentiaries
and
the
like
has
scarcely
raised
its
hand
or
spent
a
dollar
to
remove
the
cause
of
a
disease
that
brings
misery
and
despair
to
millions
and
threatens
the
destruction
of
all
social
organization
to
the
teaching
of
the
student
and
the
recommendations
of
the
humane
the
mob
answers
back
give
us
more
victims
bigger
jails
stronger
prisons
more
scaffolds
not
only
has
the
constant
multiplication
of
penal
laws
helped
without
avail
to
fill
jails
but
the
failure
to
repeal
laws
that
are
outgrown
does
its
part
as
already
stated
there
are
many
and
annoying
things
that
can
be
done
without
violating
the
law
this
no
doubt
is
responsible
for
some
of
the
general
statutes
like
that
aimed
at
the
confidence
game
that
catches
a
victim
when
the
crime
is
not
clearly
defined
as
in
robbery
burglary
larceny
and
the
like
still
it
has
been
the
general
opinion
of
those
who
have
studied
crime
and
influenced
the
passage
of
penal
laws
that
criminal
statutes
should
be
clear
and
explicit
so
that
all
would
know
what
they
must
not
do
it
is
obvious
that
if
one
is
to
be
punished
simply
for
doing
wrong
there
could
be
no
judges
or
juries
or
jailers
condemning
and
punishing
and
no
crowds
shouting
for
vengeance
all
do
wrong
and
do
it
over
and
over
again
and
day
by
day
it
is
not
only
those
specific
things
that
the
great
majority
think
are
wrong
but
the
graver
offenses
that
are
meant
to
be
the
subject
of
criminal
codes
of
course
codes
do
not
work
out
this
way
in
practice
in
effect
they
forbid
the
things
that
the
strongest
forces
of
the
community
wish
forbidden
things
which
may
or
may
not
be
the
gravest
and
most
acts
but
which
at
least
seem
to
the
strong
to
be
most
hostile
to
their
interests
and
ruling
emotions
xix
medical
experts
so
long
as
the
ordinary
ideal
of
punishment
prevails
a
crime
must
consist
of
an
act
coupled
with
an
intent
to
do
the
thing
which
probably
means
an
intent
to
do
evil
this
is
no
doubt
the
right
interpretation
of
intent
although
cases
can
be
found
generally
of
a
minor
grade
which
hold
that
evil
intent
is
not
necessary
to
the
crime
under
the
law
as
generally
laid
down
insanity
is
a
defense
to
crime
when
the
insanity
is
so
far
advanced
as
to
blot
out
and
obliterate
the
sense
of
right
and
wrong
or
render
the
accused
unable
to
choose
the
right
and
avoid
the
wrong
of
course
legal
definitions
of
scientific
terms
processes
or
things
do
not
ordinarily
show
the
highest
wisdom
it
is
safe
to
say
that
few
judges
or
lawyers
have
ever
been
students
of
insanity
of
the
relation
of
will
to
conduct
or
of
other
questions
of
science
or
philosophy
each
man
confines
himself
to
his
field
of
operation
and
the
love
of
living
does
not
induce
him
to
go
far
from
the
matter
in
hand
which
to
him
means
the
base
of
supplies
the
insane
are
exempted
from
punishment
for
crime
on
the
ground
that
they
are
not
able
to
prepare
and
attend
to
their
cases
when
placed
on
trial
and
on
the
further
ground
that
their
free
will
is
destroyed
by
disease
or
something
else
and
therefore
they
could
form
no
intent
in
another
place
i
have
tried
to
point
out
the
fact
that
the
acts
of
the
sane
and
the
insane
are
moved
by
like
causes
but
this
is
not
the
theory
of
the
law
insanity
is
often
very
insidious
many
cases
are
easily
classified
but
there
is
always
the
border
line
the
twilight
zone
which
is
sure
to
exist
in
moral
questions
and
in
all
questions
of
human
conduct
and
this
is
hard
to
settle
it
is
generally
determined
by
the
feelings
of
a
jury
moved
or
not
by
the
prejudice
of
the
public
depending
on
whether
the
community
has
been
lashed
or
persuaded
to
take
a
hand
in
the
conduct
of
the
case
lawyers
and
judges
are
not
psychologists
or
psychiatrists
neither
are
juries
therefore
the
doctor
must
be
called
in
as
a
rule
the
lawyer
has
little
respect
for
expert
opinion
he
has
so
often
seen
and
heard
all
sorts
of
experts
testify
for
the
side
that
employs
them
and
give
very
excellent
reasons
for
their
positive
and
contradictory
opinions
that
he
is
bound
to
regard
them
with
doubt
in
fact
while
lawyers
respect
and
admire
many
men
who
are
expert
witnesses
and
while
many
such
men
are
men
of
worth
still
they
know
that
the
expert
is
like
the
lawyer
he
takes
the
case
of
the
side
that
employs
him
and
does
the
best
he
can
the
expert
is
an
frequenter
of
the
courts
he
makes
his
living
by
testifying
for
contesting
litigants
of
course
scientific
men
do
not
need
to
be
told
that
the
receipt
of
or
expectation
of
a
fee
is
not
conducive
to
arriving
at
scientific
results
every
psychologist
knows
that
as
a
rule
men
believe
what
they
wish
to
believe
and
that
the
hope
of
reward
is
an
excellent
reason
for
wanting
to
believe
it
is
not
my
intention
to
belittle
scientific
knowledge
or
to
criticise
experts
beyond
such
general
statements
as
will
apply
to
all
men
i
have
often
received
the
services
of
medical
experts
when
valuable
time
was
given
without
any
financial
reward
purely
from
a
sense
of
justice
but
all
men
are
bound
to
be
interested
in
arriving
at
the
conclusion
they
wish
to
reach
furthermore
the
contending
lawyers
are
willing
to
assist
them
in
arriving
at
the
conclusions
that
the
lawyer
wants
it
is
almost
inevitable
that
both
sides
will
employ
experts
when
they
have
the
means
the
poor
defendant
is
hopelessly
handicapped
he
is
as
a
rule
unable
to
get
a
skillful
lawyer
or
skillful
experts
a
opinion
on
insanity
is
none
too
good
especially
in
a
case
where
he
is
called
only
for
a
casual
examination
and
has
not
had
the
chance
for
long
study
the
doctor
for
the
prosecution
may
find
that
the
subject
can
play
cards
and
talk
connectedly
on
most
things
and
as
he
is
casually
visiting
him
for
a
purpose
he
can
see
no
difference
between
him
and
other
men
this
may
well
be
the
case
and
still
have
little
to
do
with
insanity
experts
called
for
the
defense
can
not
always
be
sure
that
the
patient
truthfully
answers
the
questions
a
doctor
must
make
up
his
mind
from
examining
the
patient
except
so
far
as
hypothetical
questions
may
be
used
in
all
larger
cities
certain
doctors
are
regularly
employed
by
the
prosecution
while
it
would
be
too
much
to
say
that
they
always
find
the
patient
sane
it
is
safe
to
say
that
they
nearly
always
do
especially
is
this
true
in
times
of
public
clamor
which
affects
all
human
conduct
a
court
trial
with
an
insanity
defense
often
comes
down
largely
to
the
relative
impression
of
the
testimony
of
the
experts
who
flatly
contradict
each
other
leaving
with
intelligent
men
a
doubt
as
to
whether
either
one
really
meant
to
tell
the
truth
the
jury
knows
that
they
are
paid
for
their
opinions
and
regards
them
more
or
less
as
it
regards
the
lawyers
in
the
case
it
listens
to
them
but
does
not
rely
upon
their
opinions
expert
testimony
is
always
unsatisfactory
in
a
contested
case
under
present
methods
it
can
never
be
any
different
there
is
another
danger
juries
do
not
know
the
difference
in
the
standing
character
and
attainments
of
doctors
so
the
tendency
is
always
to
find
the
man
who
will
make
the
best
appearance
and
testify
the
most
positively
for
his
side
this
is
unfair
to
the
expert
unfair
to
science
and
unfair
to
the
case
the
method
for
overcoming
this
difficulty
that
has
received
most
sanction
from
students
is
that
experts
shall
be
chosen
by
the
state
and
appear
for
neither
side
this
like
most
other
things
has
advantages
and
disadvantages
state
officials
or
those
chosen
by
the
state
usually
come
to
regard
themselves
as
a
part
of
the
machinery
of
justice
and
to
stand
with
the
prosecuting
attorney
for
conviction
it
will
most
likely
be
the
same
with
state
defenders
no
one
who
really
would
defend
could
be
elected
or
could
be
appointed
and
it
would
work
out
in
really
having
two
prosecutors
one
nominally
representing
the
defense
a
defendant
should
be
left
to
get
any
lawyer
or
any
expert
he
wishes
no
one
can
be
sure
that
the
state
expert
will
be
better
than
the
others
all
one
can
say
is
that
state
experts
may
not
be
partisans
but
in
effect
this
would
mean
that
they
would
not
be
partisans
for
the
defendant
the
constant
association
with
the
prosecutor
the
officers
of
the
jail
the
public
officials
and
those
charged
with
enforcing
the
law
would
almost
surely
place
them
on
the
side
of
the
state
such
men
must
be
elected
or
appointed
by
some
tribunal
this
brings
them
to
the
attention
of
the
public
and
makes
them
dependent
on
the
public
the
expert
interest
will
then
be
the
same
as
the
interest
of
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
not
a
partisan
his
office
is
judicial
he
is
not
interested
in
convicting
or
paid
for
convicting
and
yet
no
sane
person
familiar
with
courts
would
think
that
the
defendant
could
be
safely
left
in
his
hands
assuming
he
is
honest
it
makes
little
difference
almost
no
prosecutor
dares
do
anything
the
public
does
not
demand
neither
as
a
rule
has
he
training
nor
interest
to
study
any
subject
but
the
law
the
profounder
and
more
important
matters
affecting
life
and
conduct
are
a
sealed
book
which
he
could
not
open
if
he
would
very
soon
under
our
political
system
the
expert
business
would
gravitate
into
the
hands
of
politicians
the
last
group
that
should
handle
any
scientific
problem
i
am
free
to
confess
the
difficulties
of
the
present
system
but
some
other
way
may
be
even
worse
it
must
always
be
remembered
that
this
country
is
governed
by
public
opinion
that
public
opinion
is
always
crude
uninformed
and
heartless
in
criminal
cases
there
is
no
time
to
set
it
right
the
position
of
the
accused
is
hard
enough
at
best
he
is
really
presumed
guilty
before
he
starts
every
lawyer
employed
to
any
extent
in
criminal
practice
knows
that
in
an
important
case
his
greatest
danger
is
public
opinion
he
would
not
take
the
officers
and
attachés
of
the
court
as
jurors
although
they
might
be
good
men
for
their
interest
and
psychology
would
be
always
for
conviction
if
defendants
were
not
regarded
as
moral
delinquents
if
the
examination
implied
no
moral
condemnation
if
it
was
only
a
scientific
investigation
as
to
where
to
place
him
if
he
is
if
public
opinion
supported
this
view
then
experts
should
be
appointed
by
the
court
on
this
phase
of
the
case
there
would
be
little
need
of
experts
i
would
be
willing
to
go
further
and
say
that
then
too
the
partisan
lawyer
the
hired
advocate
should
disappear
the
machinery
of
justice
would
be
to
take
care
of
the
liberties
of
every
man
to
give
him
proper
treatment
in
disease
to
restore
him
to
freedom
when
safe
and
when
that
time
does
come
the
unseemly
contest
in
courts
will
disappear
and
justice
tempered
with
mercy
will
have
a
chance
xx
punishment
assuming
that
man
is
justified
in
fixing
the
moral
worth
of
his
fellow
that
he
is
justified
in
punishment
for
the
purpose
of
making
the
offender
suffer
and
that
these
punishments
according
to
the
degree
of
severity
will
in
some
way
pay
for
or
make
good
the
criminal
act
or
protect
or
help
society
or
prevent
crime
or
even
help
the
offender
or
someone
else
what
finally
is
the
correct
basis
of
fixing
penalties
no
science
experience
or
philosophy
and
very
little
humanity
has
ever
been
considered
in
fixing
punishments
the
ordinary
penalties
are
first
fines
which
generally
penalize
someone
else
more
than
the
victim
these
with
the
poor
mean
depriving
families
and
friends
of
sorely
needed
money
and
the
direct
and
indirect
consequences
are
sometimes
small
and
sometimes
very
great
these
can
be
readily
imagined
if
instead
of
fines
a
prison
sentence
is
given
a
sort
of
decimal
system
has
been
worked
out
by
chance
or
laziness
or
symmetry
of
figures
certainly
it
has
been
done
wholly
regardless
of
science
for
there
is
no
chance
to
apply
science
when
it
comes
to
degrading
men
and
taking
away
a
portion
of
their
lives
generally
ten
days
is
the
shortest
from
this
the
court
goes
to
twenty
then
thirty
then
sixty
then
three
months
then
six
months
then
one
year
why
not
eleven
days
why
not
days
why
not
forty
days
why
not
seventy
days
why
not
four
months
or
five
or
eight
or
nine
or
ten
months
is
there
no
place
between
six
months
in
jail
and
a
year
in
jail
the
bids
at
an
auction
or
the
flipping
of
pennies
are
exact
sciences
compared
with
the
relation
between
crime
and
punishment
and
the
process
of
arriving
at
the
right
penalty
if
in
the
wisdom
of
the
members
of
the
legislature
the
crime
calls
for
imprisonment
in
the
penitentiary
then
the
ordinary
sentences
run
one
two
five
ten
fifteen
twenty
thirty
years
and
life
according
to
the
hazard
of
the
legislature
the
whim
of
the
court
the
gamble
of
the
jury
or
the
feeling
and
means
of
expression
of
the
unthinking
and
pitiless
crowd
who
awe
courts
and
juries
with
their
cries
for
vengeance
neither
does
punishment
affect
any
two
alike
the
sensitive
and
proud
may
suffer
more
from
a
day
in
jail
or
even
from
conviction
than
another
would
suffer
from
a
year
the
various
courts
and
juries
of
the
different
states
fix
different
penalties
even
in
the
same
state
there
is
no
sort
of
resemblance
to
the
punishments
generally
given
for
similar
crimes
some
jurisdictions
some
juries
and
some
courts
will
make
these
three
or
four
times
as
severe
as
others
for
the
same
things
some
days
the
same
judge
will
give
a
longer
sentence
than
on
other
days
in
this
judges
are
like
all
of
us
we
have
our
days
when
we
feel
kindly
and
sympathetic
toward
all
mankind
we
have
our
days
when
we
mistrust
and
dislike
the
world
in
general
and
many
people
in
particular
largely
the
weather
influences
those
feelings
therefore
the
amount
of
time
a
person
spends
in
prison
may
depend
to
a
great
extent
on
the
condition
of
the
weather
at
the
time
of
conviction
or
when
sentence
is
passed
the
physical
condition
of
judge
or
jury
and
above
all
their
types
of
mind
are
no
two
men
have
the
same
imagination
some
are
harsh
and
cruel
others
kind
and
sympathetic
one
can
weigh
wheat
and
corn
and
butter
and
sugar
one
can
measure
water
and
molasses
and
gasoline
when
one
measures
or
weighs
one
can
speak
with
exactness
regarding
the
thing
involved
justice
and
mercy
and
punishment
can
not
be
measured
or
weighed
in
fact
there
is
even
no
starting
point
the
impossibility
of
it
all
makes
many
of
the
humane
and
wise
doubt
their
right
to
pass
judgment
upon
their
fellow
man
society
no
doubt
is
bound
by
to
resist
certain
acts
and
to
restrain
certain
men
but
it
is
in
no
way
bound
to
pass
moral
judgments
under
any
system
based
on
a
scientific
treatment
of
crime
men
would
be
taken
care
of
as
long
as
it
was
necessary
to
restrain
them
it
would
be
done
in
the
best
possible
way
for
their
own
welfare
if
they
ever
were
adjudged
competent
to
enter
society
again
they
would
be
released
when
that
time
came
neither
under
a
right
understanding
and
a
humane
scientific
and
honest
administration
would
it
be
necessary
that
places
of
confinement
should
be
places
of
either
degradation
or
misery
in
fact
the
inmate
might
well
be
put
where
he
could
enjoy
life
more
than
he
did
before
he
was
confined
it
might
and
should
be
the
case
also
that
he
could
produce
enough
to
amply
take
care
of
himself
and
provide
for
those
who
would
naturally
look
to
him
for
support
and
perhaps
make
compensation
for
the
injury
he
had
caused
to
someone
else
it
is
obvious
that
this
can
not
be
done
until
men
have
a
different
point
of
view
toward
crime
in
the
last
hundred
years
much
has
been
done
to
make
prisons
better
and
to
make
more
tolerable
the
life
of
the
inmates
this
has
been
accomplished
by
men
who
looked
on
criminals
as
being
at
least
to
a
certain
extent
like
other
men
above
all
as
things
are
now
the
prison
inmate
has
no
chance
to
learn
to
conform
unless
hope
is
constantly
kept
before
him
he
should
be
like
the
convalescing
invalid
able
from
time
to
time
to
note
his
gradual
progress
in
the
ability
to
make
the
adjustments
that
are
necessary
to
social
beings
no
patient
in
a
hospital
could
be
cured
if
he
were
constantly
told
that
he
could
not
get
well
and
should
not
get
well
his
imagination
should
be
enlarged
by
every
means
that
science
can
bring
to
the
teaching
of
man
first
of
all
there
must
be
individual
treatment
no
one
would
think
of
putting
hundreds
or
thousands
of
the
ill
or
insane
into
a
pen
giving
them
numbers
leaving
them
so
that
no
capable
person
knows
their
names
their
histories
their
families
their
possibilities
their
strength
or
their
weaknesses
every
intelligent
person
must
know
that
this
would
inevitably
lead
to
misery
and
death
the
treatment
of
men
in
prison
is
a
much
more
difficult
problem
than
the
care
of
the
physically
diseased
it
requires
a
knowledge
of
biology
of
psychology
of
hygiene
of
teaching
and
of
life
it
needs
infinite
patience
and
sympathy
it
needs
thorough
acquaintance
and
constant
attention
it
is
a
harder
task
than
the
one
that
confronts
the
physician
in
the
hospital
because
the
material
is
poorer
the
make
is
more
defective
and
the
process
of
cure
or
development
much
slower
and
not
so
easily
seen
no
person
is
entirely
without
the
sympathetic
idealistic
and
altruistic
impulses
which
after
all
are
the
mainsprings
of
social
adaptation
probably
these
innate
feelings
can
be
found
in
prisoners
as
generally
as
in
other
men
it
is
the
lack
of
these
qualities
that
often
keeps
men
outside
the
jail
they
get
by
where
kindly
and
impulsive
men
fail
a
large
part
of
the
crime
especially
of
the
young
comes
from
the
desire
to
do
something
for
someone
else
and
from
the
ease
with
which
persons
are
led
or
yield
to
solicitation
the
criminal
has
always
been
met
by
coldness
and
hatred
that
have
made
him
lose
his
finer
feelings
have
blunted
his
sensibilities
and
have
taught
him
to
regard
all
others
as
his
enemies
and
not
his
friends
the
ideal
society
is
one
where
the
individuals
move
harmoniously
in
their
various
orbits
without
outside
control
the
governing
power
of
a
perfect
order
in
its
last
analysis
must
be
within
the
individual
a
perfect
system
probably
will
never
come
men
are
too
imperfect
too
weak
too
ignorant
and
too
selfish
to
accomplish
it
still
if
we
wish
to
go
toward
perfection
there
is
no
other
road
one
of
the
favorite
occupations
of
legislatures
is
changing
punishments
in
obedience
to
the
clamor
of
the
public
in
times
of
ordinary
tranquility
a
penalty
may
even
be
modified
or
reduced
but
let
the
newspapers
awaken
public
opinion
to
crime
by
the
judicious
use
of
headlines
and
a
hot
campaign
let
the
members
feel
that
there
is
a
popular
clamor
and
that
votes
may
be
won
or
lost
and
the
legislature
responds
this
is
generally
done
without
reference
to
the
experience
of
the
world
without
regard
to
the
nature
of
man
with
no
thought
of
the
victim
and
with
no
clear
conception
of
how
the
legislation
will
really
affect
the
public
the
demand
is
constantly
made
that
such
crimes
as
kidnapping
train
robbing
rape
and
robbery
should
be
punished
with
death
or
at
least
with
imprisonment
for
life
irrespective
of
its
effect
on
the
criminal
what
is
the
effect
on
the
victim
of
the
criminal
a
man
is
held
up
on
a
lonely
highway
the
robber
does
not
intend
to
kill
his
face
is
exposed
if
the
penalty
for
robbery
is
life
imprisonment
he
kills
to
avoid
detection
if
it
is
death
he
kills
even
before
he
robs
the
same
thing
operates
in
rape
in
burglary
and
in
other
crimes
in
all
property
crimes
not
only
is
no
killing
intended
or
wanted
but
precautions
are
taken
to
guard
against
killing
all
laws
to
make
drastic
penalties
should
really
be
entitled
an
act
to
promote
murder
making
penalties
too
drastic
destroys
the
effect
meant
to
be
produced
public
clamor
does
not
last
forever
men
grow
tired
of
keeping
their
tongues
wagging
on
the
same
subject
all
the
time
a
state
of
frenzy
is
abnormal
and
when
it
subsides
the
temperature
not
only
goes
back
to
normal
but
as
far
below
as
it
has
been
above
when
the
fury
has
spent
itself
jurors
regain
some
of
their
human
feeling
and
refuse
to
convict
history
has
proved
this
over
and
over
again
and
still
politicians
always
seek
to
ride
into
power
on
the
crest
of
the
wave
when
the
wave
moves
back
they
can
easily
go
back
with
it
even
if
the
severe
punishments
should
be
continued
without
abatement
these
soon
lose
their
power
to
terrify
communities
grow
accustomed
to
hangings
they
get
used
to
life
sentences
and
long
imprisonments
and
the
severity
no
longer
serves
to
awe
the
cruelty
serves
only
as
a
mark
of
the
civilization
of
the
day
some
day
perhaps
a
wiser
and
more
humane
world
will
marvel
at
our
cruelty
and
ignorance
as
we
now
marvel
at
the
barbarity
of
the
past
xxi
the
effect
of
punishment
on
others
the
ordinary
man
who
hears
of
a
crime
hates
the
criminal
and
wants
him
to
suffer
he
does
not
picture
the
malefactor
as
a
man
who
for
some
reason
has
committed
a
dreadful
act
still
less
does
he
ask
has
he
a
father
or
mother
a
wife
or
children
brothers
or
sisters
and
how
are
these
affected
by
his
deed
no
one
can
intelligently
deal
with
the
criminal
without
considering
these
practically
no
inmate
of
a
prison
stands
alone
he
is
a
member
of
a
family
or
small
social
group
and
inevitably
the
interests
of
these
others
are
more
or
less
closely
bound
up
with
his
if
punishment
is
justified
for
its
influence
on
society
these
must
be
taken
into
account
with
the
other
members
of
the
social
organization
the
criminal
it
must
be
remembered
is
almost
always
poor
he
has
a
mother
brothers
and
sisters
wife
or
children
dependent
for
support
to
a
large
extent
upon
his
casual
earnings
he
is
placed
in
jail
or
the
penitentiary
and
the
family
must
make
new
adjustments
to
life
the
mother
or
wife
may
go
to
work
at
hard
labor
for
a
small
return
the
children
may
be
taken
out
of
school
and
sent
to
stores
or
factories
be
condemned
to
lives
of
drudgery
that
will
often
lead
to
crime
the
family
may
be
broken
up
and
scattered
through
institutions
and
the
poorest
shelters
a
complete
transformation
for
the
worse
almost
always
comes
over
the
home
it
is
safe
to
say
that
at
least
three
or
four
are
closely
touched
by
the
misfortune
of
every
one
these
lives
must
be
readjusted
and
the
chances
are
that
the
new
adjustments
will
not
be
equal
to
the
old
if
for
nothing
else
than
because
the
conviction
is
a
serious
handicap
in
their
struggles
let
anyone
go
to
a
city
jail
on
a
visiting
day
and
see
the
old
mothers
the
stunned
and
weeping
wives
the
little
children
down
to
babes
in
arms
who
crowd
around
the
corridors
to
get
a
look
at
the
man
behind
the
bars
to
them
at
least
he
is
a
human
being
with
feelings
and
affections
with
wants
and
needs
all
of
these
can
recount
his
many
good
qualities
which
the
world
can
not
see
or
know
their
first
step
is
to
borrow
or
to
sell
what
they
can
to
provide
means
for
his
defense
everything
else
is
cast
aside
day
after
day
they
visit
the
jail
and
the
lawyer
contriving
means
to
save
liberty
or
life
when
the
trial
comes
they
watch
through
its
maze
in
a
dazed
bewildered
way
they
know
that
the
man
they
love
is
not
the
one
who
is
painted
in
the
court
room
and
at
least
to
them
he
is
not
if
he
is
convicted
and
goes
to
prison
for
a
term
of
years
then
month
by
month
the
faithful
family
goes
to
see
him
for
an
hour
in
the
prison
visiting
across
the
table
in
open
view
of
guards
and
others
as
unfortunate
as
they
the
family
follows
all
sorts
of
advice
and
directions
and
seeks
out
many
hopeless
clews
for
men
of
influence
and
position
who
can
unlock
prison
doors
the
weeks
run
into
months
and
the
months
into
years
and
still
many
of
them
keep
up
their
hopeless
vigil
some
are
driven
to
drudgery
some
to
crime
some
to
destruction
for
the
man
whom
the
state
has
punished
that
society
may
be
improved
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
state
ruins
at
least
one
other
life
for
every
victim
of
the
prison
no
provision
is
made
for
the
dependent
families
of
the
wretched
man
ruthlessly
society
sends
the
man
to
prison
and
sees
the
daughter
leave
school
a
mere
child
and
go
to
work
what
becomes
of
her
it
does
not
know
or
care
it
seems
not
to
know
that
she
exists
the
state
sees
the
convict
boy
working
at
casual
tasks
and
growing
up
on
the
streets
while
his
father
is
paying
the
penalty
of
his
act
he
may
on
this
account
follow
his
father
to
jail
it
is
not
society
concern
assuming
that
an
offender
must
be
confined
for
the
protection
of
society
as
some
no
doubt
must
be
still
the
effect
on
the
family
and
how
to
prevent
its
destruction
should
be
among
the
first
concerns
in
the
disposition
of
the
case
xxii
evolution
of
punishment
among
primitive
peoples
the
penal
code
was
always
short
desire
for
property
had
not
taken
possession
of
their
emotions
their
lives
were
simple
their
adjustments
few
and
there
was
no
call
for
an
elaborate
code
of
prohibited
acts
their
punishments
were
generally
simple
direct
and
severe
usually
death
or
banishment
which
often
meant
death
sometimes
maiming
and
branding
so
that
the
offender
might
serve
as
a
constant
warning
to
others
primitive
peoples
early
asked
questions
about
their
origin
and
destiny
the
unknown
filled
most
of
the
experiences
of
their
lives
the
realm
of
the
known
was
very
small
they
had
no
idea
of
law
and
system
of
cause
and
effect
they
early
began
evolving
religious
ideas
the
manifestations
of
nature
the
mystery
of
birth
the
fear
of
death
the
phenomena
of
dreams
the
growth
and
harvesting
of
crops
all
of
these
were
beyond
their
understanding
they
peopled
the
earth
with
gods
to
be
propitiated
and
appeased
everything
was
the
act
of
a
special
providence
from
early
times
religion
and
witchcraft
furnished
the
chief
subjects
for
the
criminal
code
the
penalties
for
the
violation
of
the
code
were
always
severe
generally
death
and
by
the
most
terrorizing
ways
no
other
crime
could
be
so
great
as
to
arouse
the
anger
of
the
gods
and
naturally
no
other
conduct
should
demand
so
severe
a
penalty
as
calling
down
the
wrath
of
the
gods
this
would
fall
not
only
upon
the
offending
man
but
upon
the
community
of
which
he
was
a
part
even
as
man
developed
in
knowledge
and
civilization
this
sort
of
crime
continued
to
furnish
the
greater
proportion
of
victims
and
the
most
cruel
punishments
torture
of
the
most
fiendish
sort
was
evoked
to
catch
offenders
and
extort
confessions
difference
of
religious
opinions
was
the
worst
crime
the
inquisition
became
an
established
thing
sometimes
a
nation
was
almost
wiped
out
that
heretics
should
be
killed
and
heresies
destroyed
the
heretic
was
the
one
who
did
not
accept
the
prevailing
faith
the
list
of
victims
of
punishment
on
account
of
religion
witchcraft
sorcery
and
kindred
laws
has
in
the
past
no
doubt
been
larger
than
for
any
other
charges
this
kind
of
laws
always
called
out
the
greatest
zeal
in
their
enforcement
to
the
religious
enthusiast
nothing
else
was
of
equal
importance
it
involved
not
only
the
life
of
man
on
earth
but
his
life
through
all
eternity
our
statutes
today
are
replete
with
such
crimes
but
the
punishments
have
been
lessened
and
as
a
rule
communities
will
not
enforce
them
but
laws
against
blasphemy
working
on
sunday
and
sunday
amusements
of
all
sorts
are
still
on
the
books
and
enforced
in
some
places
a
large
organization
and
an
influential
and
aggressive
part
of
the
christian
church
are
insisting
that
these
laws
shall
be
enforced
to
the
limit
and
that
still
others
shall
be
placed
among
the
statutes
of
the
several
states
the
methods
of
inflicting
the
death
penalty
have
been
various
the
favorite
ways
being
burning
boiling
in
oil
boiling
in
water
breaking
on
the
rack
smothering
beheading
crucifying
stoning
strangling
and
electrocuting
until
the
middle
of
the
last
century
they
were
carried
out
in
the
presence
of
the
multitude
so
that
all
might
be
warned
by
the
example
the
number
of
crimes
for
which
death
and
bodily
torture
have
been
the
punishment
can
scarcely
be
recorded
and
if
they
could
it
would
be
of
no
value
they
would
run
into
the
hundreds
and
probably
the
thousands
a
large
part
of
these
crimes
are
now
obsolete
doubtless
more
men
have
been
executed
for
crimes
they
did
not
commit
and
could
not
commit
than
for
any
real
wrong
of
which
they
were
guilty
prisons
came
into
fashion
later
than
the
death
penalty
and
as
a
form
of
punishment
have
gradually
come
to
take
the
place
of
most
death
penalties
prisons
in
the
past
have
been
loathsome
places
and
not
much
better
than
death
prisoners
have
been
packed
together
so
closely
that
life
was
almost
impossible
to
incarcerate
victims
in
prisons
has
brought
terrible
punishment
not
only
on
the
prisoners
and
their
families
but
indirectly
on
the
state
no
doubt
through
the
years
prisons
have
been
gradually
improved
many
of
their
terrors
have
been
banished
people
have
come
to
believe
that
even
a
prisoner
should
have
some
consideration
from
the
state
penalties
have
likewise
grown
less
severe
and
terms
have
been
shortened
but
this
course
has
not
been
regular
or
constant
the
public
readily
relaxes
into
hatred
and
vengeance
and
it
is
easy
to
arouse
these
feelings
in
men
since
they
lie
very
close
to
the
surface
a
constant
struggle
has
always
been
waged
by
the
humane
to
make
man
more
kindly
and
yet
probably
his
nature
does
not
really
change
a
few
months
of
frenzy
may
easily
undo
the
work
of
years
so
long
as
men
punish
for
the
sake
of
punishment
there
will
be
a
disagreement
between
the
advocates
of
long
punishment
and
short
punishment
hard
punishment
and
light
punishment
from
the
nature
of
things
there
is
no
basis
on
which
this
can
be
determined
the
only
thing
that
throws
any
light
on
the
question
is
experience
and
men
can
always
differ
as
to
the
lessons
of
experience
neither
do
they
remember
experience
when
feelings
are
concerned
punishment
can
deter
only
on
the
ground
of
the
fear
that
flows
from
it
fear
comes
from
things
that
are
more
or
less
unusual
man
has
little
abstract
fear
of
a
natural
death
it
is
so
unavoidable
that
it
does
not
even
figure
in
the
ordinary
affairs
of
life
extreme
punishments
may
grow
so
common
that
few
give
them
any
concern
they
probably
are
so
common
now
that
the
impression
they
make
is
not
very
great
lighter
and
easier
punishments
would
have
the
same
psychological
effect
in
many
cases
a
lenient
punishment
would
also
eliminate
much
of
the
hatred
and
bitterness
against
the
world
that
are
common
to
all
inmates
of
prisons
xxiii
capital
punishment
the
question
of
capital
punishment
has
been
the
subject
of
endless
discussion
and
will
probably
never
be
settled
so
long
as
men
believe
in
punishment
some
states
have
abolished
and
then
reinstated
it
some
have
enjoyed
capital
punishment
for
long
periods
of
time
and
finally
prohibited
the
use
of
it
the
reasons
why
it
can
not
be
settled
are
plain
there
is
first
of
all
no
agreement
as
to
the
objects
of
punishment
next
there
is
no
way
to
determine
the
results
of
punishment
if
the
object
is
assumed
it
is
a
matter
of
conjecture
as
to
what
will
be
most
likely
to
bring
the
result
if
it
could
be
shown
that
any
form
of
punishment
would
bring
the
immediate
result
it
would
be
impossible
to
show
its
indirect
result
although
indirect
results
are
as
certain
as
direct
ones
even
if
all
of
this
could
be
clearly
proven
the
world
would
be
no
nearer
the
solution
questions
of
this
sort
or
perhaps
of
any
sort
are
not
settled
by
reason
they
are
settled
by
prejudices
and
sentiments
or
by
emotion
when
they
are
settled
they
do
not
stay
settled
for
the
emotions
change
as
new
stimuli
are
applied
to
the
machine
a
state
may
provide
for
life
imprisonment
in
place
of
death
some
especially
atrocious
murder
may
occur
and
be
fully
exploited
in
the
press
public
feeling
will
be
fanned
to
a
flame
bitter
hatred
will
be
aroused
against
the
murderer
it
is
perfectly
obvious
to
the
multitude
that
if
other
men
had
been
hanged
for
murder
this
victim
would
not
have
been
killed
a
legislature
meets
before
the
hatred
has
had
time
to
cool
and
the
law
is
changed
again
a
community
may
have
capital
punishment
and
nothing
notable
happens
now
and
then
hangings
occur
juries
acquit
because
of
the
severity
of
the
penalty
a
feeling
of
shame
or
some
bungling
execution
may
arouse
a
community
against
it
a
doubt
may
arise
as
to
the
guilt
of
a
man
who
has
been
put
to
death
the
sentimental
people
triumph
the
law
is
changed
nothing
has
been
found
out
no
question
has
been
settled
science
has
made
no
contribution
the
public
has
changed
its
mind
or
speaking
more
correctly
has
had
another
emotion
and
passed
another
law
in
the
main
the
controversy
over
capital
punishment
has
been
one
between
emotional
and
unemotional
people
now
and
then
the
emotionalist
is
reinforced
by
some
who
have
a
religious
conviction
against
capital
punishment
based
perhaps
on
the
rather
trite
expression
that
god
gave
life
and
only
god
should
take
it
away
such
a
statement
is
plausible
but
not
capable
of
proof
in
the
main
religious
people
believe
in
capital
punishment
the
advocates
of
capital
punishment
dispose
of
the
question
by
saying
that
it
is
the
sentimentalist
or
rather
the
maudlin
sentimentalist
who
is
against
it
sentimentalist
really
implies
maudlin
but
emotion
too
has
its
biological
origin
and
is
a
subject
of
scientific
definition
a
really
sentimental
person
in
the
sense
used
is
one
who
has
sympathy
this
in
turn
comes
from
imagination
which
is
probably
the
result
of
a
sensitive
nervous
system
one
that
quickly
and
easily
responds
to
stimuli
those
who
have
weak
emotions
do
not
respond
so
readily
to
impressions
their
assumption
of
superior
wisdom
has
its
basis
only
in
a
nervous
system
which
is
sluggish
and
phlegmatic
to
stimuli
such
impressions
as
each
system
makes
are
registered
on
the
brain
and
become
the
material
for
recollection
and
comparison
which
go
to
form
opinion
the
correctness
of
the
mental
processes
depends
upon
the
correctness
of
the
senses
that
receive
the
impression
the
nerves
that
transmit
the
correctness
of
the
registration
and
the
character
of
the
brain
it
does
not
follow
that
the
stoic
has
a
better
brain
than
the
despised
sentimentalist
either
one
of
them
may
have
a
good
one
and
either
one
of
them
a
poor
one
still
charity
and
kindliness
probably
come
from
the
sensitive
system
which
imagines
itself
in
the
place
of
the
object
that
it
pities
all
pity
is
really
pain
engendered
by
the
feelings
that
translate
one
into
the
place
of
another
both
hate
and
love
are
biologically
necessary
to
life
and
its
processes
many
people
urge
that
the
penalty
of
imprisonment
for
life
would
be
all
right
if
the
culprit
could
be
kept
in
prison
during
life
but
in
the
course
of
time
he
is
pardoned
this
to
me
is
an
excellent
reason
why
his
life
should
be
saved
it
is
proof
that
the
feeling
of
hatred
that
inspired
judge
and
jury
has
spent
itself
and
that
they
can
look
at
the
murderer
as
a
man
which
decision
is
the
more
righteous
the
one
where
hatred
and
fear
affect
the
judgment
and
sentence
or
the
one
where
these
emotions
have
spent
their
force
everyone
who
advocates
capital
punishment
is
really
ashamed
of
the
practice
for
which
he
is
responsible
instead
of
urging
public
executions
the
most
advanced
and
sensitive
who
believe
in
killing
by
the
state
are
now
advocating
that
even
the
newspapers
should
not
publish
the
details
and
that
the
killing
should
be
done
in
darkness
and
silence
in
that
event
no
one
would
be
deterred
by
the
cruelty
of
the
state
that
capital
punishment
is
horrible
and
cruel
is
the
reason
for
its
existence
that
men
should
be
taught
not
to
take
life
is
the
purpose
of
judicial
killings
but
the
spectacle
of
the
state
taking
life
must
tend
to
cheapen
it
this
must
be
evident
to
all
who
believe
in
suggestion
constant
association
and
familiarity
tend
to
lessen
the
shock
of
any
act
however
revolting
if
men
regarded
the
murderer
as
one
who
acted
from
some
cause
and
who
was
simply
an
instrument
in
an
endless
sequence
of
cause
and
effect
would
anyone
say
he
should
be
put
to
death
it
is
not
easy
to
estimate
values
correctly
it
may
be
that
life
is
not
important
nature
seems
extravagantly
profligate
in
her
giving
and
pitiless
in
her
taking
away
yet
death
has
something
of
the
same
shock
today
that
was
felt
when
men
first
gazed
upon
the
dead
with
awe
and
wonder
and
terror
constantly
meeting
it
and
seeing
it
and
procuring
it
will
doubtless
make
it
more
commonplace
to
the
seasoned
soldier
in
the
army
it
means
less
than
it
did
before
he
became
a
soldier
probably
the
undertaker
thinks
less
of
death
than
almost
any
other
man
he
is
so
accustomed
to
it
that
his
mind
must
involuntarily
turn
from
its
horror
to
a
contemplation
of
how
much
he
makes
out
of
the
burial
if
the
civilized
savages
have
their
way
and
make
hangings
common
we
shall
probably
recover
from
some
of
our
instinctive
fear
of
death
and
the
extravagant
value
that
we
place
on
life
the
social
organism
is
like
the
individual
organism
it
can
be
so
often
shocked
that
it
grows
accustomed
and
weary
and
no
longer
manifests
resistance
or
surprise
so
far
as
we
can
reason
on
questions
of
life
and
death
and
the
effect
of
stimuli
upon
human
organisms
the
circle
is
like
this
frequent
executions
dull
the
sensibilities
toward
the
taking
of
life
this
makes
it
easier
for
men
to
kill
and
increases
murders
which
in
turn
increase
hangings
which
in
turn
increase
murders
and
so
on
around
the
vicious
circle
in
the
absence
of
any
solid
starting
point
on
which
an
argument
can
be
based
in
the
absence
of
any
reliable
figures
in
the
absence
of
any
way
to
interpret
the
figures
in
the
absence
of
any
way
to
ascertain
the
indirect
results
of
judicial
killings
even
if
the
direct
ones
could
be
shown
in
the
impossibility
through
life
experience
or
philosophy
of
fixing
relative
values
the
question
must
remain
where
it
has
always
been
a
conflict
between
the
emotional
and
unemotional
the
sentimental
and
the
stolid
the
imaginative
and
the
unimaginative
the
sympathetic
and
the
unsympathetic
personally
being
inclined
to
a
purely
mechanistic
view
of
life
and
to
the
belief
that
all
conduct
is
the
result
of
certain
stimuli
upon
a
human
machine
i
can
only
say
that
the
stimuli
of
seeing
and
reading
of
capital
punishment
applied
to
my
machine
is
revolting
and
horrible
perhaps
as
the
world
improves
the
sympathetic
and
imaginative
nature
will
survive
the
stolid
and
selfish
at
least
one
can
well
believe
that
this
is
the
line
of
progress
if
there
shall
be
progress
a
matter
still
open
to
question
and
doubt
xxiv
stigmata
of
the
criminal
lombroso
and
others
have
emphasized
the
theory
that
the
criminal
is
a
distinct
physical
type
this
doctrine
has
been
so
positively
asserted
and
with
such
a
show
of
statistics
and
authority
that
it
has
many
advocates
more
recent
investigations
seem
to
show
conclusively
that
there
is
little
or
no
foundation
for
the
idea
that
the
criminal
is
a
separate
type
men
accustomed
to
criminal
courts
and
prisons
can
not
avoid
being
impressed
with
the
marks
of
inferiority
that
are
apparent
in
prisoners
most
prisoners
are
wretched
and
poorly
nourished
wear
poor
clothes
and
are
and
unkempt
their
stunted
appearance
is
doubtless
due
largely
to
poor
food
the
irregularity
of
nourishment
and
the
sordidness
of
their
lives
in
general
one
also
imagines
that
a
prisoner
looks
the
part
and
in
his
clothes
and
surroundings
he
generally
does
it
is
hard
for
a
prisoner
to
look
he
has
neither
the
opportunity
nor
the
ambition
to
give
much
attention
to
his
personal
appearance
the
looks
of
the
prisoners
are
of
little
value
nothing
but
actual
measurements
could
give
real
information
and
these
do
not
sustain
the
theory
of
their
being
different
from
other
men
it
is
not
possible
to
see
how
the
criminal
can
be
of
a
distinct
physical
type
criminality
exists
only
in
reference
to
an
environment
one
can
not
be
born
a
criminal
one
may
be
and
often
is
born
with
such
an
imperfect
equipment
that
he
can
not
make
his
adjustments
to
life
and
soon
falls
a
victim
to
crime
and
disease
all
that
a
physical
examination
could
do
would
be
to
show
the
strength
or
weakness
of
the
body
and
its
various
organs
what
may
befall
him
will
depend
partly
on
the
kind
and
quality
of
his
mind
and
nervous
system
and
partly
on
the
physical
structure
and
the
kind
of
experiences
that
life
holds
in
store
for
him
no
doubt
thorough
psychological
examinations
would
reveal
something
of
the
brain
just
as
physical
examinations
certainly
would
determine
the
strength
and
capacity
of
the
body
this
would
be
of
material
aid
in
determining
the
kind
of
environment
that
should
be
found
for
the
individual
and
if
such
environment
could
be
easily
found
it
would
avert
most
of
the
calamities
which
beset
the
path
of
the
youth
something
can
be
told
of
a
person
character
from
his
eyes
the
expression
of
the
face
and
the
contour
of
the
head
but
this
information
is
very
misleading
as
our
everyday
experience
shows
it
is
not
necessary
to
find
stigmata
in
the
prisoner
to
know
that
he
was
born
the
way
he
is
one
character
must
be
fixed
before
birth
whether
nature
marks
it
on
one
head
or
not
likewise
every
particle
of
matter
moves
from
stimuli
and
obedience
to
law
regardless
of
whether
it
shows
in
the
face
or
not
the
strong
are
no
more
exempt
from
the
law
than
the
weak
all
the
difference
is
that
they
can
longer
and
more
easily
avoid
disaster
everyone
is
in
the
habit
of
forming
a
hasty
opinion
of
another
by
reading
his
face
and
noting
his
expression
but
the
indication
given
by
facial
expression
is
mainly
the
product
of
the
life
that
has
been
lived
and
tells
something
of
the
part
that
the
hidden
emotions
have
played
on
the
body
it
has
been
generally
believed
that
mind
has
its
seat
in
the
brain
and
the
nervous
system
later
investigations
however
seem
to
show
that
it
is
the
product
of
the
whole
physical
organism
there
is
no
chance
to
measure
or
weigh
or
still
less
assay
the
qualities
of
the
machine
it
is
certain
that
the
quality
of
the
mind
depends
very
little
upon
either
the
contour
or
size
of
the
skull
about
all
that
can
be
learned
of
the
mind
and
the
character
of
the
man
must
be
gathered
from
the
manifestation
of
the
machine
it
is
shown
by
his
behavior
in
action
and
reaction
this
behavior
is
caused
by
the
capture
storage
and
release
of
energy
through
the
ductless
glands
a
defective
mechanism
either
inherited
or
acquired
through
imperfectly
balanced
glands
will
inevitably
produce
an
imperfect
mind
and
defective
conduct
this
it
will
be
bound
to
do
because
the
body
is
the
mind
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
man
is
branded
physically
with
the
mark
of
cain
if
criminology
were
so
simple
it
would
not
be
difficult
to
handle
the
manifestations
of
the
human
machine
are
infinite
and
only
patience
and
careful
study
can
find
the
points
of
weakness
and
of
strength
that
all
brains
and
bodies
have
both
is
beyond
dispute
no
physical
human
structure
was
ever
put
together
where
the
organs
were
equally
strong
to
do
the
work
assigned
to
them
some
part
of
the
body
always
needs
watchfulness
and
repair
and
can
never
be
depended
upon
in
emergencies
in
times
of
overstress
and
strain
the
defective
organ
or
organs
will
manifest
their
weakness
the
intricate
nervous
system
and
the
brain
the
unseen
instincts
and
emotions
likewise
do
not
work
perfectly
but
as
a
rule
the
ones
that
underwork
or
overwork
can
not
be
seen
by
a
physical
examination
it
generally
requires
great
subtlety
to
find
them
and
careful
treatment
and
environment
to
make
the
machine
work
fairly
well
in
spite
of
these
imperfections
this
could
be
provided
in
most
cases
the
machine
could
be
placed
in
an
environment
where
it
would
work
fairly
well
but
instead
of
this
all
the
effort
that
is
made
to
keep
the
machine
in
shape
is
a
threat
of
the
jail
if
it
goes
wrong
it
is
then
left
to
run
itself
without
help
or
assistance
of
any
kind
while
examinations
of
the
head
do
not
show
marked
differences
between
prisoners
and
others
a
great
distinction
is
seen
between
the
general
proportion
and
the
degrees
of
nourishment
of
prisoners
and
those
not
accused
of
crime
nothing
is
more
common
than
the
weak
and
underfed
condition
of
the
delinquent
and
the
criminal
this
needs
no
expert
examination
it
is
obvious
to
all
the
poor
scanty
clothes
and
personal
belongings
corroborate
the
fact
that
the
accused
is
poor
and
has
not
enough
to
eat
or
wear
nor
anything
but
the
most
scanty
shelter
in
addition
to
these
facts
he
is
almost
always
a
report
recently
published
based
on
investigations
by
a
special
committee
of
the
new
york
state
commission
of
prisons
shows
that
in
the
new
york
reformatory
only
eight
per
cent
passed
the
required
physical
examination
in
the
penitentiary
where
the
average
age
was
higher
only
five
per
cent
passed
the
test
in
the
work
house
the
home
of
the
down
and
outs
only
one
per
cent
passed
the
health
tests
employed
were
those
for
admission
to
the
army
it
was
likewise
found
by
the
same
commission
that
of
those
in
good
health
or
fair
physical
condition
per
cent
were
while
only
eighteen
per
cent
of
those
in
poor
physical
condition
took
care
of
themselves
disease
and
ill
health
when
found
so
generally
are
in
themselves
indications
of
a
defective
system
and
such
machines
are
constantly
exposed
to
temptation
their
needs
are
ever
present
and
their
poverty
great
sickness
and
disease
weaken
or
destroy
such
inhibitions
as
the
unfortunate
are
able
to
build
up
and
they
readily
yield
to
crime
xxv
the
good
in
criminals
the
criminal
is
confronted
in
court
with
an
indictment
charging
him
with
a
violation
of
the
law
he
is
a
human
being
like
all
others
neither
perfect
nor
entirely
worthless
he
has
some
tendencies
and
inclinations
which
the
world
calls
good
for
lack
of
a
better
term
and
some
that
it
calls
bad
for
the
same
reason
in
this
he
is
like
the
jury
and
the
judge
the
strength
of
the
different
tendencies
is
not
the
same
in
any
two
machines
the
judge
and
jury
are
interested
in
determining
whether
he
is
good
or
bad
that
is
better
or
worse
than
they
themselves
in
theory
he
is
tried
on
the
charges
contained
in
the
indictment
in
most
cases
by
a
constant
stretching
of
the
rules
of
evidence
his
whole
life
may
be
involved
that
is
proof
may
be
offered
of
any
act
of
delinquency
that
constituted
a
violation
of
the
law
if
in
any
way
similar
or
in
any
way
connected
with
the
one
charged
in
the
indictment
he
can
not
meet
these
charges
by
proving
the
acts
of
kindness
and
charity
and
real
worth
that
are
rarely
absent
in
any
life
the
proceedings
show
how
bad
he
is
not
how
good
he
may
be
able
to
call
witnesses
to
show
that
up
to
the
time
of
the
bringing
of
the
indictment
his
reputation
for
honesty
was
good
but
he
can
not
show
that
he
supported
his
grandmother
or
helped
his
aunt
or
educated
his
younger
brother
or
gave
his
money
to
the
poor
all
the
good
is
irrelevant
to
the
issue
this
does
not
prove
that
he
did
not
commit
the
act
it
might
clearly
prove
whether
on
the
whole
he
should
go
to
jail
through
this
process
he
feels
that
the
law
and
proceedings
are
unfair
and
that
he
is
condemned
when
in
fact
he
is
as
good
as
those
who
judge
him
neither
can
he
show
the
circumstances
that
hedged
in
his
way
nor
the
equipment
with
which
he
entered
life
under
the
legal
theory
that
he
is
the
captain
of
his
soul
these
are
not
material
to
the
issue
neither
can
he
show
the
direct
motive
that
caused
the
conduct
it
may
have
been
a
motive
that
was
ideal
but
the
question
involved
is
did
he
violate
the
law
he
is
convicted
and
sent
to
prison
as
a
rule
he
will
some
time
be
turned
back
into
the
world
he
needs
careful
treatment
involving
instruction
and
an
appeal
to
that
part
of
his
nature
which
may
awaken
sympathies
and
produce
emotions
that
will
make
him
more
of
a
social
being
on
his
return
to
the
world
in
the
loose
language
of
the
world
it
is
necessary
for
him
not
only
to
learn
how
to
curb
the
evil
but
how
to
increase
the
good
his
imagination
should
be
cultivated
and
enlarged
the
responses
to
better
sentiment
should
be
strengthened
this
can
be
furthered
only
by
skilled
teachers
who
are
moved
by
the
desire
to
help
him
the
process
should
be
similar
to
a
hospital
treatment
instead
of
this
he
is
usually
surrounded
by
men
of
little
intelligence
or
education
men
who
have
no
fitness
for
the
task
he
is
governed
by
strict
rules
all
of
them
subjecting
him
to
severe
penalties
when
violated
every
action
in
the
prison
reminds
him
of
his
status
with
the
exception
of
a
few
strong
men
who
need
suffering
for
their
development
it
can
have
but
one
result
he
must
come
out
from
prison
poorer
material
than
when
he
went
in
there
are
only
two
reflections
that
can
keep
him
out
of
trouble
in
the
future
the
remembrance
of
the
past
and
the
fear
that
a
similar
experience
might
come
to
him
again
when
it
is
remembered
that
the
greatest
enemy
to
happiness
and
life
is
fear
when
we
realize
that
the
constant
battle
of
the
primitive
man
was
with
the
fear
that
peoples
the
unknown
with
enemies
and
dangers
when
we
remember
that
in
some
way
fear
of
poverty
of
disease
of
disaster
of
loss
of
friends
and
life
is
the
enemy
of
us
all
it
is
evident
that
nothing
but
harm
can
come
from
the
lessons
of
fear
that
are
drilled
into
the
victim
in
prison
life
furnishes
countless
ways
to
be
kind
and
helpful
and
social
it
furnishes
infinite
ways
to
be
cruel
hard
and
most
of
these
ways
are
not
condemned
by
the
law
whether
the
life
is
helpful
and
kindly
or
hard
and
selfish
can
never
depend
upon
the
response
of
an
organism
to
fear
but
upon
the
response
of
an
organism
to
the
kindlier
and
more
humane
and
sympathetic
sentiments
that
to
some
extent
at
least
inhere
in
the
constitution
of
man
it
is
a
common
thing
for
prisoners
even
during
the
longest
term
to
be
more
solicitous
about
mother
child
wife
brother
or
friend
than
about
themselves
it
is
common
for
them
to
deny
themselves
privileges
presents
or
favors
to
help
other
inmates
the
consideration
and
kindness
shown
by
unfortunates
to
each
other
are
surprising
to
those
who
have
no
experience
with
this
class
of
men
often
to
find
real
sympathy
you
must
go
to
those
who
know
what
misery
means
pride
and
coldness
are
usually
due
to
lack
of
understanding
and
life
alone
can
bring
understanding
every
intelligent
man
engaged
in
efforts
to
improve
and
help
either
criminals
or
children
or
any
others
knows
the
need
of
an
appeal
to
what
passes
as
the
better
nature
help
does
not
come
so
much
from
directly
inhibiting
the
bad
as
by
extending
the
area
of
the
higher
emotions
to
pull
up
weeds
in
a
garden
without
planting
something
in
their
place
is
a
foolish
task
the
human
being
is
like
the
garden
something
must
grow
in
the
soil
if
weeds
are
pulled
up
and
nothing
planted
nature
will
grow
more
weeds
some
feelings
and
emotions
always
possess
every
person
the
best
that
is
incident
to
the
machine
should
be
found
and
this
be
cultivated
and
extended
until
it
dominates
the
man
courts
and
prisons
have
no
machinery
to
cultivate
the
best
in
their
victims
they
are
always
looking
for
the
worst
aiding
and
promoting
it
until
the
prisoner
is
driven
to
hopelessness
and
despair
xxvi
the
defective
and
insane
it
is
almost
hopeless
to
bring
any
system
or
order
out
of
the
chaos
that
prevails
in
the
discussion
of
the
insane
the
defective
the
moron
and
the
the
world
has
so
long
believed
that
man
is
a
specially
created
animal
and
that
he
does
wrong
from
free
choice
that
much
more
time
and
investigation
are
necessary
before
sane
and
scientific
theories
can
be
formulated
on
this
subject
it
has
been
a
great
many
years
since
any
man
believed
that
all
sorts
of
physical
abnormalities
were
due
to
one
cause
and
could
be
cured
by
one
method
and
yet
the
prevailing
opinion
now
even
among
the
fairly
educated
is
that
all
sorts
of
abnormal
conduct
are
due
to
one
cause
perversity
and
wickedness
and
should
be
treated
with
only
one
prescription
punishment
scientific
men
indeed
have
long
known
that
there
were
causes
for
the
abnormality
of
conduct
and
that
there
were
various
more
or
less
satisfactory
remedies
for
many
cases
still
the
time
that
scientists
have
worked
on
the
problem
is
short
and
the
data
imperfect
and
many
years
of
patient
study
will
be
needed
before
there
can
be
worked
out
the
broad
theories
of
responsibility
for
and
treatment
of
crime
which
will
replace
the
long
accepted
doctrines
of
original
sin
and
the
expulsion
of
devils
from
the
wicked
by
cruelty
and
punishment
by
far
the
largest
part
of
the
population
of
prisons
is
made
up
of
the
insane
morons
defectives
or
victims
of
diseases
that
seriously
influence
conduct
this
is
especially
shown
by
the
increased
percentage
of
the
clearly
defective
that
are
repeaters
over
those
in
prison
for
their
first
offense
there
is
no
lack
of
statistics
as
to
the
various
groups
of
defectives
but
these
figures
can
not
be
reconciled
no
two
authorities
agree
as
to
percentages
the
classifications
are
more
or
less
uncertain
the
dividing
lines
between
the
different
groups
are
vague
one
class
easily
fading
into
another
the
investigations
have
largely
been
made
by
those
not
trained
for
the
work
and
above
all
the
conclusions
as
to
treatment
are
at
variance
doubtful
and
necessarily
not
yet
satisfactory
that
the
clearly
insane
and
the
plainly
should
not
be
punished
would
doubtless
be
admitted
by
all
who
speak
in
public
or
write
for
others
to
read
many
persons
speaking
in
private
acting
on
juries
and
connected
with
the
machinery
of
justice
say
that
these
should
be
punished
like
the
rest
still
for
a
starting
point
it
may
be
assumed
that
most
men
would
agree
that
these
classes
should
be
restrained
rather
than
punished
the
chief
difficulty
is
that
between
the
most
violently
insane
and
the
least
emotional
man
are
infinite
numbers
of
gradations
blending
so
closely
that
no
one
can
mathematically
or
scientifically
classify
all
the
various
individual
units
while
there
are
cases
of
insanity
that
can
be
clearly
traced
to
injury
or
disease
the
degree
of
sanity
in
most
cases
is
still
impossible
to
determine
most
insane
people
are
sane
on
some
things
generally
on
most
things
and
are
sane
a
part
or
most
of
the
time
the
periods
of
sanity
and
insanity
can
be
distinguished
only
by
conduct
how
far
any
specific
insanity
may
impair
the
brain
and
affect
the
inhibitions
is
impossible
to
foretell
when
it
comes
to
the
defective
the
problem
is
still
more
difficult
no
two
persons
have
the
same
degree
of
intelligence
some
are
clearly
lacking
in
mentality
others
are
manifestly
intelligent
the
great
mass
range
all
along
between
these
extremes
various
arbitrary
rules
have
been
laid
down
to
aid
in
classifying
different
grades
of
defectives
generally
the
can
be
sorted
out
the
defectives
are
supposed
if
young
to
be
two
years
or
more
below
the
normal
scholar
in
development
if
older
three
or
more
below
their
standing
is
fixed
by
asking
certain
test
questions
furthermore
a
list
of
questions
has
been
commonly
used
for
an
intelligence
test
these
queries
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
school
work
of
the
child
but
are
supposed
to
reveal
only
his
native
intelligence
no
doubt
in
a
broad
way
such
tests
throw
considerable
light
on
the
mentality
of
those
who
submit
to
the
examination
ordinary
experience
however
shows
that
they
can
not
be
fully
relied
on
some
children
develop
very
slowly
others
very
rapidly
some
are
much
quicker
others
slower
in
their
perceptions
and
responses
no
two
children
or
have
the
same
turn
of
mind
one
may
be
very
bright
in
business
affairs
and
very
dull
in
books
one
may
be
clever
in
arithmetic
and
hopeless
in
grammar
one
may
have
marked
mechanical
ability
and
no
taste
for
school
these
tests
are
only
valuable
if
given
by
well
qualified
examiners
and
the
method
is
so
new
that
few
have
had
the
chance
to
thoroughly
prepare
for
the
work
for
the
most
part
the
tests
are
given
by
people
who
are
wholly
unfit
for
so
important
a
task
quite
aside
from
all
this
it
is
not
certain
that
intelligent
people
are
necessarily
safer
to
the
community
than
stupid
ones
there
is
always
a
tendency
for
the
stupid
to
stick
to
the
beaten
path
intelligence
generally
means
individuality
and
divergence
on
the
other
hand
the
stupid
and
subnormal
are
moved
much
more
directly
by
instincts
and
emotions
their
lack
of
imagination
poor
perceptions
and
want
of
reasoning
or
comparing
power
make
their
weak
in
sudden
stress
or
an
unusual
situation
they
are
easily
swept
away
and
respond
directly
to
instinct
and
feeling
in
short
the
urge
of
the
primitive
through
the
long
history
of
the
race
can
not
be
modified
sufficiently
by
the
new
structure
that
civilization
has
built
around
more
intelligent
people
the
various
distinctions
between
the
and
the
normal
must
not
be
taken
with
too
much
confidence
as
the
motives
that
govern
man
are
understood
it
is
easy
to
see
that
intelligence
is
a
strong
factor
in
regulating
behavior
when
it
is
seen
also
that
at
least
the
larger
part
of
the
inmates
of
prisons
are
subnormal
and
at
the
same
time
without
property
or
education
it
is
evident
that
all
these
handicaps
are
dominating
causes
of
conduct
this
position
is
made
still
more
certain
by
the
further
evidence
that
nearly
all
of
the
repeaters
in
prison
are
of
this
type
most
states
already
make
some
allowances
in
their
criminal
codes
for
the
defective
and
the
insane
this
is
really
an
acknowledgment
that
the
activity
of
the
human
machine
is
governed
by
its
make
and
environment
the
history
of
the
treatment
of
the
insane
serves
to
show
the
uncertainty
of
all
man
theories
as
to
punishment
and
responsibility
doubtless
at
a
very
early
age
in
the
history
of
man
it
was
discovered
that
there
were
people
who
acted
so
abnormally
that
they
could
not
be
classified
with
the
great
mass
such
persons
were
supposed
to
be
possessed
of
devils
or
demons
and
various
incantations
and
practices
were
used
to
drive
the
devils
out
failing
in
this
they
were
put
in
prison
loaded
with
chains
or
put
to
death
because
of
their
danger
to
the
community
in
other
communities
however
insane
persons
were
thought
to
be
possessed
of
special
gifts
god
had
come
nearer
to
them
than
to
common
mortals
and
they
were
seers
or
prophets
endowed
with
a
portion
of
the
divine
power
either
view
of
the
problem
is
explainable
by
the
lack
of
scientific
or
exact
knowledge
that
marks
early
societies
still
these
societies
relied
on
punishments
just
as
much
as
our
present
and
enforcers
possibly
more
because
presumably
less
enlightened
further
investigation
and
experiences
with
the
insane
have
convinced
even
the
most
casual
observer
that
they
function
somewhat
differently
from
other
people
there
is
not
the
same
certainty
between
stimulus
and
response
what
they
will
do
and
how
they
will
act
under
given
conditions
can
not
be
foretold
with
anything
approaching
the
exactness
that
is
possible
with
the
normal
the
origin
of
the
insanity
in
many
cases
is
clearly
traceable
sometimes
to
lesions
sometimes
to
illness
sometimes
to
the
mode
of
life
perhaps
more
is
due
to
heredity
than
to
any
other
cause
at
any
rate
in
theory
the
civilized
world
has
long
since
ceased
to
hold
the
insane
criminally
responsible
for
their
acts
this
applies
only
to
the
clearly
insane
the
is
impossible
to
find
and
many
cases
are
so
difficult
to
classify
that
there
is
often
a
doubt
as
to
where
the
given
patient
belongs
in
times
when
the
crowd
is
mad
with
the
mob
psychology
of
hatred
people
are
impatient
of
insanity
and
do
not
care
whether
the
accused
was
sane
or
not
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
act
many
insane
are
put
to
death
or
sentenced
to
long
terms
of
punishments
jails
and
other
penal
institutions
are
constantly
sorting
their
inmates
and
finding
many
who
were
clearly
insane
at
the
time
their
sentences
began
society
is
beginning
to
find
out
that
even
where
there
is
no
marked
insanity
many
are
so
near
idiocy
that
they
can
not
fairly
be
held
responsible
for
their
acts
the
line
here
is
just
as
vague
and
uncertain
as
with
the
insane
thus
far
society
has
not
provided
adequate
protection
for
the
public
against
this
class
neither
has
it
properly
cared
for
these
unfortunates
it
has
simply
excused
their
conduct
except
in
cases
where
some
act
is
so
shocking
that
it
arouses
special
hatred
and
then
it
freely
declares
that
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
accused
is
a
defective
or
not
he
is
of
no
value
to
the
world
and
should
die
many
of
this
class
are
put
to
death
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
most
of
those
executed
are
either
insane
or
serious
defectives
and
those
who
say
that
such
people
are
of
no
value
are
probably
right
it
is
perhaps
equally
true
that
few
if
any
are
of
value
for
when
value
is
considered
we
are
met
with
the
question
value
to
whom
or
for
what
all
you
can
say
of
any
one
is
that
he
wishes
to
live
and
has
the
same
inherent
instincts
and
emotions
toward
life
as
are
common
to
all
other
men
even
the
legal
tests
as
to
insanity
and
are
neither
logical
nor
humane
often
the
definition
is
given
by
courts
that
if
one
is
able
to
distinguish
between
right
and
wrong
he
is
sane
within
the
meaning
of
the
law
this
definition
of
insanity
is
utterly
unscientific
if
the
insane
or
the
defective
above
an
idiot
is
questioned
specifically
whether
certain
distinct
things
are
right
or
wrong
he
can
generally
give
the
conventional
classification
often
he
can
tell
much
better
than
the
intelligent
man
for
he
has
been
arbitrarily
taught
the
things
that
are
right
and
wrong
and
has
not
the
originality
or
ability
to
inquire
whether
the
classification
is
right
or
how
far
circumstances
and
conditions
determine
right
and
wrong
conduct
is
ruled
by
emotion
and
actions
depend
not
upon
whether
one
has
learned
to
classify
certain
conduct
as
right
or
wrong
but
whether
from
education
life
or
otherwise
the
thought
of
a
certain
act
produces
a
quick
and
involuntary
reaction
against
doing
it
no
one
believes
or
feels
that
it
is
always
really
wrong
to
violate
some
statutes
and
most
men
indulge
in
many
practices
that
are
wrong
and
repulsive
but
not
forbidden
by
the
criminal
code
furthermore
the
insane
and
subnormal
are
influenced
by
punishment
and
fear
even
the
animal
responds
to
both
it
is
possible
that
in
many
instances
those
who
are
insane
and
subnormal
are
influenced
by
fear
more
than
the
intelligent
and
normal
the
most
that
can
be
said
is
that
they
have
not
the
same
power
of
resistance
that
is
given
stronger
men
this
means
only
that
they
have
not
stored
up
the
experiences
of
life
so
well
that
their
nervous
system
has
not
so
well
conveyed
impressions
or
that
their
power
of
comparison
is
less
this
in
turn
means
that
it
will
take
greater
stress
or
harder
environment
to
overcome
the
inhibitions
of
the
sane
than
the
insane
the
treatment
of
the
insane
and
the
defective
is
an
acknowledgment
that
all
conduct
comes
from
a
direct
response
of
the
machine
to
certain
stimuli
and
the
machine
can
act
only
in
a
way
consistent
with
its
mechanism
in
other
cases
the
courts
often
recognize
the
strength
of
hereditary
defects
in
nullifying
environment
with
its
strict
ideas
of
right
and
wrong
the
kleptomaniac
is
generally
recognized
as
being
a
class
of
the
insane
most
of
the
are
women
this
is
especially
a
female
crime
it
is
useless
to
explain
why
it
is
not
a
daring
crime
it
is
secretive
in
its
nature
it
requires
more
stealth
than
courage
it
especially
appeals
to
women
on
account
of
their
taste
for
the
finery
exhibited
at
stores
the
kleptomaniac
however
is
generally
a
rich
or
influential
woman
she
steals
something
she
does
not
need
and
she
is
therefore
held
to
be
a
kleptomaniac
and
not
responsible
the
poor
woman
who
steals
something
she
actually
needs
is
not
a
kleptomaniac
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
rich
woman
who
could
not
resist
is
a
kleptomaniac
i
have
just
as
little
doubt
that
the
poor
woman
with
an
imperfect
make
found
her
environment
such
that
she
was
forced
to
act
as
she
did
if
a
rich
woman
is
irresponsible
and
can
not
resist
when
she
steals
something
she
does
not
need
i
can
see
no
reason
why
a
poor
woman
is
not
likewise
irresponsible
when
she
takes
something
that
she
needs
or
must
have
the
kleptomaniac
finds
herself
in
a
position
where
her
emotions
and
her
feelings
are
too
strong
for
her
judgment
and
inhibitions
everyone
who
acts
must
act
from
similar
causes
or
inducements
there
is
no
special
providence
in
the
realm
of
mind
there
is
no
room
for
chance
in
any
natural
phenomenon
possibly
the
public
will
understand
sometime
and
and
will
place
crime
and
punishment
on
a
scientific
basis
xxvii
social
control
organizations
and
cults
are
forever
coining
new
expressions
that
sound
pat
and
for
this
reason
seem
true
as
a
rule
these
terms
and
phrases
are
put
in
the
shape
of
general
statements
that
may
or
may
not
mean
something
but
their
pat
sound
is
used
to
justify
all
sorts
of
excesses
and
violations
of
individual
rights
the
term
social
control
is
met
everywhere
now
it
may
imply
much
or
little
according
to
the
construction
of
the
users
it
is
meant
at
least
to
imply
that
somewhere
is
lodged
a
power
to
bring
under
control
or
supervision
the
refractory
or
evil
elements
of
society
for
the
well
being
of
the
whole
as
a
rule
under
this
phrase
anything
is
justified
which
seems
in
some
way
fit
for
the
community
as
a
whole
the
fact
that
the
restraint
interferes
with
personal
liberty
seems
to
have
no
bearing
on
the
matter
social
control
necessarily
means
that
the
majority
of
the
members
of
a
social
unit
shall
limit
the
freedom
of
action
of
the
individual
to
conform
to
its
view
of
course
the
majority
has
the
right
because
it
has
the
power
in
the
discussion
of
political
or
philosophical
questions
right
means
little
more
or
less
than
power
a
right
must
be
based
upon
some
custom
or
habit
with
some
power
to
enforce
it
or
it
can
not
be
claimed
it
can
never
be
enjoyed
without
the
power
to
obtain
it
the
relation
of
society
to
the
individual
has
been
one
long
conflict
this
is
necessarily
true
because
every
human
organism
has
instincts
feelings
and
desires
and
is
naturally
impatient
at
any
limitations
placed
upon
it
unless
on
the
other
hand
organized
society
functions
to
preserve
itself
and
if
the
activities
of
the
individual
are
hostile
to
this
preservation
the
individual
must
give
way
theorists
of
various
schools
are
forever
propounding
social
ideas
with
the
positive
assurance
that
if
followed
they
would
work
automatically
and
heal
all
social
ills
but
it
must
be
evident
that
neither
from
history
nor
philosophy
can
any
such
theory
be
proved
between
the
extreme
anarchistic
view
that
each
person
should
be
free
of
control
by
law
and
the
extreme
socialistic
view
of
an
extension
of
state
organization
until
all
property
and
all
industrial
activity
shall
be
administered
by
the
state
and
collectively
owned
social
life
in
its
relation
to
the
individual
is
always
shifting
no
one
can
find
the
proper
line
and
if
there
were
a
line
it
would
forever
change
on
the
one
hand
the
power
of
the
strongest
element
in
social
organization
is
always
seeking
to
enlarge
the
province
of
the
state
on
the
other
hand
the
individual
unit
following
the
natural
instincts
for
its
development
is
reaching
out
for
more
freedom
and
life
when
the
theorists
in
each
camp
manage
to
push
so
hard
that
both
can
no
longer
be
maintained
the
old
organization
of
society
breaks
up
into
new
units
immediately
to
in
some
new
way
this
struggle
of
contending
forces
is
a
prolific
and
unavoidable
source
of
crime
when
organized
society
goes
too
far
the
individual
units
rebel
and
clash
with
law
when
the
units
swing
too
far
away
from
the
social
organization
and
defy
the
power
of
the
state
almost
automatically
some
sort
of
a
new
organization
becomes
the
state
whether
this
new
one
discards
all
old
forms
and
laws
and
acts
without
the
written
law
is
of
no
concern
it
at
least
acts
and
sets
limits
to
the
individual
life
if
it
were
possible
for
all
legislative
bodies
to
meet
and
repeal
all
laws
the
state
would
still
remain
the
people
would
live
and
automatically
form
themselves
into
a
certain
order
and
protect
that
order
either
by
written
law
or
vigilance
committees
at
least
the
people
would
act
together
the
majority
generally
has
some
religious
creed
and
to
it
this
is
all
important
this
creed
is
made
up
of
observances
such
as
holy
days
the
support
of
the
prevailing
religion
the
condemnation
of
witchcraft
and
magic
and
the
like
these
and
other
doctrines
often
have
been
enforced
upon
those
who
have
no
faith
in
the
regulations
the
enforcement
of
such
laws
in
the
past
has
been
by
the
most
drastic
penalties
and
has
brought
extreme
suffering
upon
the
world
no
religious
organization
has
ever
seemed
willing
to
confine
its
activities
to
propaganda
teaching
and
moral
suasion
those
methods
are
too
slow
and
the
evils
and
consequences
of
disbelief
are
too
great
laws
of
this
drastic
character
are
still
part
of
the
penal
codes
of
various
states
and
nations
and
bodies
are
always
strenuously
seeking
to
extend
the
application
of
such
laws
and
at
least
a
portion
of
the
religious
code
that
has
been
outgrown
individuals
have
likewise
found
or
at
least
believed
that
certain
personal
habits
were
best
for
them
for
instance
abstaining
from
alcohol
and
tobacco
in
all
forms
not
content
with
propaganda
they
have
sought
to
force
their
views
upon
others
many
of
whom
deeply
resent
their
interference
it
is
not
enough
that
certain
things
shall
be
best
for
the
health
and
physical
welfare
of
a
community
this
does
not
justify
the
wise
in
making
them
a
part
of
the
penal
code
if
so
the
code
would
be
very
long
no
doubt
coffee
and
tea
and
perhaps
meat
are
injurious
to
health
most
likely
the
strength
of
the
community
would
be
conserved
if
regular
sleeping
hours
were
kept
and
if
great
modifications
or
changes
were
made
in
dress
but
this
does
not
justify
criminal
statutes
the
code
must
take
notice
of
something
more
than
the
general
welfare
unless
the
end
sought
to
be
attained
is
very
direct
and
plain
and
the
evil
great
so
that
a
large
majority
believes
in
the
law
it
should
be
left
to
education
and
to
other
voluntary
social
forces
a
large
part
of
the
community
has
always
attributed
many
criminal
acts
to
intoxicating
drinks
i
am
convinced
that
with
such
crimes
as
murder
burglary
robbery
forgery
and
the
like
alcohol
has
had
little
to
do
petty
things
like
disorderly
conduct
are
often
caused
by
intoxicating
liquor
and
these
land
a
great
many
temporarily
in
jail
but
these
acts
are
really
not
criminal
men
have
been
temporarily
locked
up
for
if
had
been
treated
the
same
as
the
jails
would
often
be
filled
with
gluttons
as
to
health
probably
the
glutton
takes
the
greater
chance
a
very
large
percentage
of
deaths
would
have
been
materially
delayed
except
for
excessive
eating
the
statements
ascribing
crime
to
intoxicating
drinks
have
generally
been
made
by
those
who
are
obsessed
with
a
hatred
of
alcohol
as
a
rule
if
one
lands
in
prison
and
has
not
been
a
total
abstainer
his
downfall
is
charged
to
rum
statistics
have
been
gathered
in
prison
often
by
chaplains
who
in
the
main
are
prohibitionists
and
interested
in
sustaining
an
opinion
the
facts
are
mainly
furnished
by
inmates
of
prisons
a
poor
source
from
which
to
gather
facts
and
draw
deductions
especially
as
to
the
cause
of
crime
prisoners
are
interested
in
only
one
thing
and
that
is
getting
out
they
understand
perfectly
well
what
kind
of
statistics
the
chaplain
wants
and
these
are
given
it
is
the
nature
and
part
of
the
protective
instinct
of
everyone
to
find
some
excuse
for
his
acts
alcohol
has
always
furnished
this
excuse
it
is
a
good
alibi
it
is
readily
believed
always
awakens
sympathy
and
at
once
turns
the
wrath
of
a
provincial
community
from
the
inmate
of
the
prison
to
the
even
if
prisoners
were
unlike
others
and
wished
to
tell
the
truth
about
themselves
they
have
not
the
art
and
understanding
to
give
the
causes
of
their
plight
no
man
however
intelligent
can
do
this
least
of
all
one
of
inferior
brain
power
little
education
and
not
trained
in
dealing
with
facts
the
prison
inmate
like
everyone
else
knows
only
that
he
followed
what
seemed
to
him
the
line
of
least
resistance
and
that
every
step
in
his
course
was
preceded
by
another
and
that
there
was
a
reason
for
what
he
did
most
likely
he
does
not
know
the
reason
in
the
hours
of
his
despair
he
goes
over
his
life
in
every
detail
at
every
crossroad
and
at
all
the
forks
where
paths
branch
always
wishing
he
had
gone
the
other
way
while
this
is
true
he
could
know
neither
the
dangers
that
lurked
along
other
roads
nor
the
fact
that
he
had
no
choice
about
the
way
he
went
all
he
knows
is
that
he
stumbled
along
a
certain
path
which
led
to
disaster
all
the
paths
of
life
lead
to
tragedy
it
is
only
a
question
as
to
how
and
when
with
some
the
evil
day
is
longer
delayed
and
the
disaster
seems
not
so
hard
to
bear
in
a
sense
all
the
classifications
as
to
the
cause
of
crime
are
misleading
and
worthless
your
existence
is
the
result
of
infinite
chances
and
causes
appalling
in
their
number
out
of
a
thousand
eggs
one
is
fertilized
by
perhaps
one
of
a
billion
sperms
and
from
this
you
have
been
given
life
each
of
your
parents
and
grandparents
and
so
on
back
for
two
hundred
thousand
years
of
human
ancestors
and
back
to
infinity
before
man
was
born
was
the
result
of
the
same
seemingly
blind
and
almost
impossible
hazard
the
infinitely
microscopic
chance
that
each
of
us
had
for
life
can
not
be
approximated
all
the
drops
of
water
in
the
ocean
or
all
the
grains
of
sand
upon
the
shore
or
all
the
leaves
on
all
the
trees
if
converted
into
numbers
and
used
as
a
denominator
with
one
for
a
numerator
could
hardly
tell
the
fraction
of
a
chance
that
gave
us
life
the
causes
of
human
action
are
infinite
and
no
cause
stands
isolated
from
the
rest
in
the
first
place
we
can
not
tell
the
meaning
of
the
word
cause
when
applied
to
a
problem
of
this
sort
in
law
the
ordinary
rule
for
a
proximate
cause
is
an
event
or
happening
in
the
direct
line
of
causation
not
too
remote
that
has
led
to
the
result
and
without
which
the
result
could
not
have
happened
but
this
means
nothing
infinite
are
the
causes
which
have
led
to
every
act
and
without
each
one
of
the
infinite
causes
the
act
could
not
have
resulted
if
it
be
something
that
affected
a
life
and
had
it
not
happened
then
the
life
would
have
drifted
somewhere
else
in
the
end
it
would
have
reached
the
same
harbor
of
nirvana
but
the
life
would
not
have
been
the
same
a
drop
of
water
falls
on
the
rocky
mountains
it
trickles
along
going
around
through
pebbles
and
grains
of
sand
it
joins
with
others
meets
trees
and
roots
winds
and
twists
perhaps
for
hundreds
even
thousands
of
miles
before
one
can
tell
by
what
channel
it
will
reach
the
sea
infinite
accidents
determine
even
which
sea
it
shall
finally
reach
the
most
radical
advocates
of
social
control
are
never
at
a
loss
to
lay
their
fingers
on
causes
or
to
know
what
would
have
happened
if
something
else
had
not
happened
they
never
hesitate
to
forbid
seemingly
innocent
acts
because
they
are
certain
that
evil
will
follow
they
are
contemptuous
of
one
who
wants
to
preserve
the
semblance
and
spirit
of
freedom
life
has
none
too
much
to
offer
where
men
are
left
to
control
themselves
and
to
be
forbidden
to
follow
your
inclinations
and
desires
because
sometimes
they
may
result
disastrously
is
to
give
up
what
seems
to
be
a
substance
for
what
is
most
likely
a
shadow
all
we
can
tell
about
the
man
whom
we
are
pleased
to
call
a
criminal
is
that
he
had
a
poor
equipment
and
met
certain
influences
motives
and
conditions
called
environment
on
his
journey
we
know
that
at
a
given
time
the
journey
has
reached
a
certain
point
it
has
met
disaster
or
success
or
most
likely
indifference
at
a
certain
point
he
has
reached
a
prison
or
is
waiting
for
the
hangman
to
tie
a
noose
around
his
neck
is
heredity
responsible
we
know
of
many
who
apparently
started
out
with
an
equipment
no
better
these
may
be
business
men
and
congressmen
and
deacons
in
the
church
while
we
do
not
know
and
can
not
know
the
trend
and
relative
strength
of
the
instincts
in
the
various
machines
or
the
emotions
that
these
and
the
whole
equipment
produced
apparently
an
equipment
as
poor
as
that
of
the
criminal
has
met
success
or
at
least
kept
its
possessor
out
of
jail
was
it
then
his
environment
we
have
known
men
placed
in
the
same
environment
perhaps
a
brother
conquering
difficulties
and
bringing
success
from
what
seemed
to
promise
certain
defeat
why
did
one
fail
where
the
other
conquered
was
it
the
will
that
caused
one
to
be
the
captain
of
his
soul
what
then
is
the
will
and
who
gave
the
weak
will
to
one
and
the
strong
will
to
another
and
if
each
was
born
with
a
certain
will
or
the
capacity
to
make
a
certain
will
who
then
is
responsible
for
the
result
or
does
the
word
will
mean
anything
as
usually
applied
all
we
can
tell
is
that
a
certain
equipment
met
a
certain
environment
and
the
result
was
early
disaster
a
change
of
even
the
slightest
factor
of
environment
might
have
saved
the
victim
from
hanging
so
that
he
could
die
a
respectable
and
peaceful
death
from
tuberculosis
or
cancer
after
all
the
inevitable
tragedy
that
in
some
form
marks
the
end
is
not
so
important
as
the
sensations
and
experiences
that
one
meets
on
the
road
life
is
hopeless
and
colorless
indeed
if
these
experiences
are
chosen
for
the
wayfarer
and
the
sensations
are
enforced
or
denied
as
the
case
may
be
nothing
recompenses
the
individual
for
the
denial
of
his
chance
to
follow
his
own
path
xxviii
industrialism
and
crime
it
was
not
until
about
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
that
the
desire
for
the
creation
and
accumulation
of
property
began
to
rule
the
world
up
to
that
time
such
small
amounts
of
property
as
man
needed
or
coveted
had
either
been
produced
in
a
simple
manner
by
himself
or
taken
in
the
easiest
way
this
new
passion
has
made
a
large
part
of
the
modern
criminal
code
a
world
of
warriors
religious
zealots
and
pastoral
people
could
not
readily
adapt
themselves
to
the
change
criminal
codes
were
lengthened
methods
of
getting
property
and
keeping
it
were
provided
for
and
other
ways
condemned
it
must
be
obvious
that
it
was
not
easy
for
man
with
his
machine
his
inherited
institutions
and
his
ancient
to
adjust
himself
rapidly
to
the
change
new
conditions
and
laws
created
new
criminals
with
the
growth
of
the
factory
system
and
accelerated
industrial
development
an
overweening
desire
for
material
things
was
awakened
as
neither
individuals
nor
societies
can
be
possessed
of
more
than
one
overpowering
emotion
at
a
time
the
devotion
to
property
naturally
weakened
religious
fervor
religion
became
more
an
abstract
belief
and
a
social
organization
than
a
vital
thing
affecting
life
and
conduct
even
before
this
time
there
was
growing
up
in
the
world
a
protest
against
the
religious
superstition
that
had
led
to
the
cruelties
of
the
past
the
scientist
and
the
modern
philosopher
were
making
their
contributions
to
the
world
of
thought
and
these
contributions
were
slowly
affecting
life
and
conduct
a
doubt
of
old
creeds
and
doctrines
and
faiths
was
coming
over
the
minds
of
men
social
conventions
were
loosening
new
customs
and
habits
were
becoming
in
short
society
and
life
were
growing
more
fluid
and
adaptable
the
growth
of
property
holdings
created
new
desires
and
new
temptations
the
accumulation
of
large
fortunes
brought
envy
and
hatred
and
ambition
the
rise
of
industries
built
the
large
cities
with
palaces
on
one
hand
and
hovels
on
the
other
the
vast
inequality
of
wealth
and
the
growth
of
workers
organizations
together
with
the
spirit
of
skepticism
which
activity
always
brings
caused
large
numbers
to
doubt
the
justice
of
property
rights
the
utility
of
many
institutions
and
the
possibility
of
radical
change
by
social
organization
it
is
perfectly
evident
that
all
of
this
movement
brought
more
conflict
between
social
units
a
constant
lengthening
of
the
criminal
code
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
controlling
powers
an
increase
of
prisons
and
an
apparent
if
not
a
real
increase
of
crime
nothing
but
a
strong
government
can
long
endure
great
inequality
of
wealth
or
social
condition
the
slaves
of
the
past
civilization
were
kept
in
subjection
by
main
strength
and
fear
this
enslavement
was
aided
by
the
deep
ignorance
of
the
masses
who
had
no
means
of
information
and
nothing
but
vague
feelings
of
the
injustice
of
their
lot
even
then
the
poor
sometimes
revolted
but
such
outbreaks
were
generally
easily
put
down
by
the
sword
the
growth
of
political
power
and
industrial
independence
has
been
accompanied
by
the
constant
conflict
of
social
forces
this
means
conflict
with
the
law
and
the
law
has
always
taken
its
toll
of
victims
new
inventions
and
methods
that
bring
power
of
any
sort
carry
with
them
social
clashes
protests
bitterness
conflicts
and
violations
of
law
the
invention
of
was
the
source
of
great
conflict
and
still
continues
to
add
to
the
inmates
of
prisons
from
the
first
the
effects
of
high
explosives
were
seen
by
the
wise
and
firearms
were
permitted
only
in
the
hands
of
those
who
could
be
depended
upon
to
support
the
state
gradually
through
the
needs
of
the
rulers
in
war
they
were
given
to
the
poor
when
the
american
revolution
separated
us
from
great
britain
the
spirit
of
democracy
and
revolt
was
strong
in
the
world
a
body
of
peasants
had
gained
independence
over
the
strongest
nation
on
earth
this
body
through
its
delegates
provided
in
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
that
the
people
should
never
be
forbidden
to
bear
arms
the
cheap
production
of
firearms
placed
them
in
the
hands
of
all
who
wished
to
buy
this
aided
feuds
and
brawls
it
also
gave
strength
to
the
burglar
and
robber
america
was
fast
becoming
a
manufacturing
and
commercial
nation
the
accumulation
of
property
was
greater
and
the
inequalities
perhaps
more
marked
than
in
any
other
land
likewise
the
poor
were
more
independent
gradually
we
came
to
rely
more
and
more
upon
the
power
of
law
and
the
force
that
goes
with
it
to
preserve
the
old
order
legislatures
and
city
councils
all
over
the
united
states
began
to
limit
and
forbid
carrying
firearms
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
was
held
no
impediment
to
this
legislation
gradually
laws
have
forbidden
the
carrying
of
guns
by
the
common
man
and
these
laws
are
growing
stronger
every
year
in
many
states
robbery
with
a
gun
may
mean
life
imprisonment
while
the
mere
carrying
of
a
revolver
is
a
serious
offense
the
passage
of
these
drastic
laws
and
the
number
of
prison
inmates
confined
for
these
offenses
show
that
the
invention
and
use
of
firearms
has
affected
crime
and
likewise
that
the
government
is
constantly
growing
more
doubtful
of
the
common
man
civilization
largely
has
to
do
with
the
creation
and
protection
of
property
although
it
is
related
to
literature
architecture
politics
art
and
the
like
even
these
things
if
not
actually
rooted
in
property
are
stimulated
or
affected
by
property
civilization
has
created
new
crimes
and
new
ways
to
commit
crime
it
has
likewise
created
many
wants
and
desires
that
furnish
the
motive
power
of
property
crimes
each
new
invention
of
civilization
adds
to
these
needs
and
these
desires
increases
the
power
of
committing
crime
and
necessitates
stricter
measures
to
prevent
it
civilization
has
likewise
created
many
new
outlets
for
the
emotions
strengthened
old
ones
weakened
others
and
added
to
the
complexity
of
life
it
has
imposed
added
strain
and
stress
upon
man
nervous
system
and
through
this
has
caused
the
abnormalities
and
excesses
that
are
either
crimes
or
lead
to
crimes
civilization
has
created
the
big
cities
in
other
words
the
powers
and
forces
that
made
civilization
have
made
the
big
cities
the
invention
and
development
of
the
railroad
has
taken
men
from
the
air
and
sunlight
and
comparative
freedom
of
motion
of
the
country
and
the
small
village
and
placed
them
in
an
atmosphere
not
really
fitted
for
normal
animal
life
especially
the
life
of
the
young
it
has
likewise
stimulated
crime
by
offering
the
opportunities
and
making
the
suggestions
that
are
potent
factors
in
crime
in
country
and
village
life
everyone
was
known
the
smallest
detail
of
every
life
was
an
open
book
this
fact
furnished
a
moral
restraint
to
the
individual
and
likewise
made
it
hard
for
him
to
violate
the
rules
of
the
game
the
opportunities
for
collecting
large
numbers
of
people
who
might
encourage
each
other
with
their
conversation
and
association
were
very
few
in
rural
life
the
man
who
would
violate
the
law
must
do
it
alone
not
only
this
but
he
must
take
his
first
steps
almost
without
suggestion
or
aid
this
confined
criminal
conduct
largely
to
the
and
the
seriously
defective
and
even
these
could
generally
live
in
a
country
atmosphere
where
life
is
simple
and
easy
without
serious
danger
to
themselves
or
others
the
great
city
with
its
swarms
of
people
its
wealth
and
poverty
its
unhealthy
atmosphere
its
opportunities
for
everyone
to
have
many
associates
and
still
be
lost
to
the
community
at
large
makes
irregular
lives
not
only
easy
but
almost
necessary
to
large
numbers
of
men
civilization
has
no
doubt
created
crime
as
it
has
created
luxury
wealth
refinement
and
ease
much
luxury
has
always
led
to
deterioration
and
decay
and
is
doubtless
leading
that
way
now
one
of
the
latest
products
of
civilization
that
has
had
a
marked
effect
on
crime
is
the
automobile
stringent
laws
are
on
the
statute
books
of
all
states
against
stealing
automobiles
yet
stealing
and
selling
automobiles
is
a
flourishing
and
growing
business
a
large
percentage
of
the
boys
in
the
juvenile
courts
of
our
cities
are
there
for
stealing
automobiles
yet
this
is
the
work
of
a
very
short
period
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
many
of
the
boys
brought
into
court
for
stealing
automobiles
would
not
have
committed
some
other
crime
if
automobiles
had
not
been
invented
and
come
into
general
use
but
i
feel
quite
sure
that
many
of
them
are
victims
of
the
automobile
madness
alone
the
automobile
is
one
of
the
latest
manias
and
fashions
that
civilization
has
provided
almost
no
one
is
free
from
the
disease
conservative
business
men
must
have
motor
cars
clerks
and
salaried
people
who
can
not
afford
them
must
get
them
mechanics
and
professional
men
who
have
no
need
for
them
except
that
others
use
them
must
contrive
to
buy
them
automobiles
are
much
more
important
today
than
houses
men
go
into
debt
and
struggle
for
money
to
buy
gasoline
so
that
they
may
drive
somewhere
for
the
sake
of
coming
back
it
has
created
a
psychology
all
its
own
a
psychology
of
movement
of
impatience
of
waste
of
futility
men
in
chicago
start
to
drive
to
milwaukee
without
the
slightest
reason
for
going
there
they
travel
the
road
so
fast
that
they
could
get
no
idea
of
the
scenery
even
if
there
were
something
to
see
they
hurry
as
if
going
for
a
doctor
they
reach
their
destination
and
then
start
back
home
the
specific
desire
that
is
satisfied
by
this
expense
and
waste
is
a
new
one
an
emotion
of
no
value
in
the
life
processes
and
probably
of
great
injury
in
life
development
it
is
a
craze
for
movement
for
haste
for
what
seems
like
change
the
automobile
has
made
its
list
of
criminals
and
it
is
making
them
every
day
probably
it
will
continue
to
make
them
until
the
flying
machine
is
perfected
and
then
to
some
extent
at
least
the
airplane
will
take
its
place
the
truth
is
that
man
is
not
adapted
to
the
automobile
his
reactions
are
too
simple
his
inherent
needs
are
not
adjusted
to
the
new
life
he
has
not
been
built
up
with
barriers
to
protect
him
from
this
insidious
temptation
which
is
claiming
its
victims
by
the
hundreds
every
day
the
boy
is
perfectly
helpless
in
the
presence
of
this
lure
he
wants
to
do
what
others
do
he
is
by
nature
active
and
venturesome
and
needs
to
keep
on
the
move
the
mechanism
itself
appeals
to
him
he
wants
to
work
in
a
garage
he
is
anxious
to
be
a
chauffeur
he
can
not
resist
an
automobile
no
such
temptation
should
be
placed
before
a
boy
it
has
added
a
great
deal
to
the
responsibility
of
parents
and
teachers
and
so
far
they
seem
not
to
have
been
able
to
meet
that
responsibility
in
any
way
aside
from
the
boys
thefts
it
has
played
a
great
part
in
crime
the
doctor
the
real
estate
agent
the
business
man
can
not
afford
to
be
without
automobiles
no
more
can
the
burglar
the
man
the
bank
robber
if
he
would
keep
up
to
date
the
automobile
has
raised
the
robbery
of
country
banks
from
a
vagrant
crime
infrequent
and
dangerous
to
a
steady
occupation
coupled
with
a
great
deal
of
excitement
and
some
chance
for
profit
so
far
no
one
has
ever
suggested
anything
to
counteract
or
lessen
the
evil
effects
except
to
increase
penalties
the
crimes
committed
with
and
for
automobiles
are
a
result
of
the
conditions
of
life
out
of
a
thousand
men
and
boys
a
certain
percentage
must
commit
these
crimes
just
as
a
certain
percentage
must
die
of
tuberculosis
the
temptation
is
very
great
the
human
equipment
is
not
strong
enough
in
many
people
to
withstand
the
temptation
they
either
buy
them
when
they
can
not
afford
to
own
them
or
they
steal
them
and
either
way
leads
to
disaster
no
doubt
men
will
some
time
become
adjusted
to
the
automobile
as
they
have
become
adjusted
to
the
horse
but
until
that
time
comes
it
will
demand
its
heavy
toll
of
unfortunates
not
only
it
seems
to
me
does
the
growth
of
civilization
mean
the
growth
of
crime
but
that
civilization
likewise
leads
to
decay
the
world
has
seen
the
result
over
and
over
again
but
it
can
not
learn
man
is
an
animal
the
law
of
his
being
demands
that
he
shall
live
close
to
nature
he
needs
the
outdoors
the
country
the
air
he
needs
to
walk
and
run
otherwise
his
digestive
apparatus
will
fail
his
brain
power
will
decay
and
the
strength
of
his
legs
will
be
impaired
civilization
runs
too
much
to
stomach
and
nerves
and
nature
will
have
revenge
to
be
sure
the
professional
american
rhapsodist
points
out
that
we
are
immune
from
natural
law
because
we
have
a
chance
to
vote
for
presidents
once
in
every
four
years
but
there
are
ample
signs
that
nature
knows
little
about
political
institutions
or
other
devices
and
that
she
will
have
her
way
how
much
the
natural
limitations
of
man
will
permit
him
to
learn
and
understand
how
far
his
instincts
and
emotional
nature
would
allow
him
to
be
controlled
by
knowledge
if
he
had
it
what
would
be
the
results
to
life
if
reason
could
control
him
are
pertinent
questions
that
affect
all
discussion
and
which
may
never
be
satisfactorily
answered
it
is
entirely
possible
that
the
student
who
tries
to
point
out
better
ways
and
teach
better
methods
does
it
only
to
satisfy
his
own
emotions
and
is
often
conscious
that
it
does
nothing
else
but
whatever
the
inducing
cause
or
result
given
a
brain
and
nervous
system
and
the
material
that
civilization
furnishes
for
reflection
these
and
other
important
subjects
will
be
interesting
topics
of
study
and
furnish
material
for
the
reflective
powers
of
man
xxix
war
and
crime
all
natural
phenomena
affect
the
activities
of
man
it
has
been
repeatedly
observed
that
the
number
of
crimes
of
assault
and
murder
increases
in
the
summer
months
and
fluctuates
with
extreme
heat
or
a
cooler
temperature
the
nervous
system
of
man
is
responsive
to
all
sorts
of
physical
and
psychological
influences
and
criminologists
take
these
into
account
in
considering
crime
as
doctors
take
them
into
account
in
treating
disease
man
is
influenced
by
substantially
all
the
things
that
affect
other
structures
and
by
many
things
that
do
not
his
nervous
system
is
more
delicate
his
emotional
nature
more
complex
and
his
brain
permits
the
handling
of
impressions
in
a
way
not
possible
to
lower
organisms
the
effect
of
war
has
always
been
manifest
in
human
conduct
man
acts
largely
from
habit
and
custom
he
does
as
others
do
without
reflection
as
to
why
he
should
do
it
or
why
others
do
it
war
is
a
sudden
violent
and
spectacular
destroyer
of
all
established
habits
in
its
conduct
and
preparation
it
has
rules
of
its
own
which
have
no
analogy
in
civil
life
the
battlefield
is
a
reversion
to
the
primitive
a
reversion
which
man
finds
it
easy
to
make
for
it
appeals
to
fundamental
instincts
which
civilization
holds
in
leash
with
great
difficulty
and
never
with
entire
success
war
especially
appeals
to
the
young
their
desire
for
activity
their
impatience
with
restraint
their
love
of
the
spectacular
their
untrained
emotions
all
find
a
ready
outlet
in
war
even
those
who
are
too
young
to
fight
still
read
of
it
talk
of
it
play
at
it
to
the
exclusion
of
other
games
war
is
a
profound
and
rapid
maker
of
mental
attitudes
and
of
complexes
that
are
quick
to
develop
and
slow
to
pass
away
both
the
quick
development
and
slow
decay
are
probably
due
to
the
fact
that
war
meets
a
decided
response
in
the
primitive
nature
of
man
nearly
all
the
newspapers
of
america
are
now
calling
attention
to
the
increase
of
crime
since
the
close
of
the
great
war
it
is
a
topic
of
pulpit
and
platform
discussion
wild
appeals
are
made
for
convictions
and
extreme
penalties
governors
and
boards
of
pardon
and
parole
are
urged
to
refuse
clemency
to
prisoners
and
are
roundly
condemned
when
they
do
their
plain
duty
even
though
they
do
it
very
reluctantly
and
tardily
it
is
probably
true
that
the
close
of
the
war
has
shown
a
large
increase
in
criminality
especially
in
crimes
of
violence
this
is
true
not
only
of
america
but
of
all
european
countries
in
some
of
the
most
afflicted
ones
civil
government
for
a
time
has
virtually
broken
down
both
the
great
need
for
food
and
clothing
and
the
overthrowing
of
conventions
customs
and
habits
are
responsible
for
the
change
here
we
perceive
a
notable
example
of
the
almost
instantaneous
disruption
of
established
for
more
than
four
years
most
of
the
western
world
did
nothing
but
kill
the
whole
world
talked
of
slaughter
and
devoted
its
energy
to
killing
every
sentiment
of
humanity
was
forgotten
even
religious
ties
and
religious
commands
were
ignored
the
prayers
to
the
almighty
contained
requests
that
he
help
the
various
fighting
nations
to
kill
their
enemies
everyone
was
taught
to
hate
the
leaders
in
the
war
knew
that
boys
could
not
do
efficient
killing
unless
they
learned
to
fear
and
hate
the
most
outrageous
falsehoods
were
freely
circulated
by
every
nation
about
its
enemies
and
their
conduct
of
the
war
the
highest
rewards
were
offered
for
new
and
more
efficient
ways
to
kill
every
school
was
turned
over
to
hate
and
preparation
for
war
and
of
course
all
the
churches
joined
in
the
universal
craze
god
would
not
only
forgive
killing
but
reward
those
who
were
the
most
expert
at
the
game
the
newspapers
carried
stories
of
battles
every
day
the
dead
and
wounded
often
running
into
the
tens
of
thousands
none
of
the
reports
was
exact
nothing
was
true
everything
was
wild
and
exaggerated
facts
were
not
strong
enough
to
make
an
impression
lies
were
deliberately
circulated
to
help
the
cause
every
tradition
and
habit
of
life
was
broken
and
broken
all
the
time
the
commandment
thou
shalt
not
kill
was
repealed
property
was
not
only
ruthlessly
destroyed
but
openly
confiscated
lying
was
a
fine
art
when
this
bears
a
harvest
after
the
war
the
public
loudly
clamors
for
hanging
boys
whose
psychology
is
a
direct
result
of
long
and
intensive
training
by
the
leaders
of
the
world
one
life
is
not
worth
considering
in
the
face
of
the
holocaust
that
has
taken
its
hundreds
of
thousands
and
has
been
defended
in
the
schools
and
churches
it
is
not
strange
that
the
harvest
of
crimes
should
come
largely
from
boys
often
those
boys
who
did
their
part
on
the
field
of
battle
whether
they
got
the
psychology
from
killing
or
reading
or
hearing
or
playing
soldier
or
training
makes
no
difference
everyone
who
has
any
reasoning
power
knows
that
they
got
it
that
it
was
deliberately
given
to
them
if
not
forced
upon
them
and
that
just
as
deliberately
the
state
is
killing
them
because
they
took
it
it
is
not
alone
the
young
who
show
this
psychology
of
killing
that
has
grown
out
of
the
war
organized
society
the
public
juries
judges
pardon
boards
and
governors
show
that
war
has
made
them
cruel
and
wanton
of
human
life
the
great
number
of
hangings
since
the
war
is
patent
to
all
observers
in
normal
times
juries
were
very
loath
to
pronounce
the
death
penalty
with
any
possible
excuse
they
always
saved
life
now
they
pride
themselves
on
taking
life
even
insanity
does
not
always
prevent
an
execution
numerous
are
the
evidences
of
the
derangements
the
war
has
created
and
left
behind
a
few
years
ago
a
prize
fight
would
not
have
been
permitted
in
more
than
one
or
two
states
in
the
union
now
state
after
state
is
passing
laws
to
permit
prize
fights
to
take
place
and
even
the
best
society
has
given
its
sanction
to
this
sort
of
sport
whether
the
state
should
permit
prize
fights
is
not
the
question
the
fact
is
as
everyone
knows
that
it
is
permitted
on
account
of
a
psychology
growing
out
of
the
war
we
content
ourselves
with
saying
it
will
never
do
to
raise
our
boys
as
they
must
learn
to
fight
it
is
not
alone
murder
that
can
be
traced
directly
to
the
war
psychology
robbery
and
burglary
have
rapidly
increased
and
much
of
this
is
due
to
the
emotions
of
boys
the
robbing
of
country
banks
has
grown
to
be
almost
a
pastime
and
often
one
or
more
participants
in
these
raids
is
a
returned
soldier
what
should
be
done
to
meet
these
new
conditions
common
honesty
common
sense
and
common
humanity
alike
plainly
show
that
a
large
part
of
the
crimes
of
violence
are
due
to
the
war
will
hangings
and
life
sentences
stop
them
and
if
so
is
it
right
for
organized
society
to
ignore
its
responsibility
and
place
it
on
the
young
men
that
they
innoculated
with
the
universal
madness
it
is
expecting
too
much
to
think
that
there
is
any
process
by
which
society
can
be
made
to
think
and
feel
some
day
however
when
the
war
fever
passes
away
crime
will
again
take
its
normal
place
this
phenomenon
is
not
new
in
the
world
everyone
interested
has
noted
it
before
it
has
followed
all
great
wars
war
means
the
breaking
up
of
old
habits
the
destruction
of
many
inhibitions
which
in
the
strongest
civilization
are
only
skin
deep
at
the
best
it
means
the
return
to
the
primitive
feelings
that
once
ruled
man
the
napoleonic
wars
left
a
long
heritage
of
crime
every
nation
in
europe
was
affected
by
them
many
years
passed
before
the
world
grew
tranquil
our
civil
war
brought
its
harvest
of
crime
it
was
felt
both
north
and
south
it
was
not
confined
to
homicide
but
was
shown
in
all
sorts
of
criminal
statistics
especially
crimes
of
violence
i
do
not
write
as
a
pacifist
there
is
nothing
in
the
constitution
of
man
that
makes
pacifism
anything
but
a
dream
man
is
largely
ruled
by
fear
and
hate
and
it
is
not
possible
to
imagine
an
individual
or
a
race
that
under
sufficient
provocation
will
not
fight
neither
is
it
possible
that
nations
will
not
always
from
time
to
time
find
the
provocation
sufficiently
great
individuals
and
nations
can
philosophize
and
reason
and
make
compromises
when
they
are
calm
but
let
them
be
moved
by
fear
and
hatred
and
these
emotions
will
sweep
away
every
other
feeling
the
conditions
for
war
were
ripe
in
and
it
was
inevitable
that
america
should
be
in
it
too
this
should
not
make
one
wish
for
war
nor
believe
in
war
nor
close
one
eyes
to
its
horrors
and
results
much
less
should
it
prevent
him
from
trying
to
do
his
part
to
restore
sanity
to
the
world
another
consequence
of
war
which
america
is
passing
through
is
the
spirit
of
this
is
always
aroused
and
must
be
aroused
to
carry
on
the
war
it
is
potent
in
creating
the
psychology
that
makes
men
fight
every
people
teaches
that
its
own
country
is
the
best
that
its
laws
and
institutions
excel
those
of
all
other
lands
this
spirit
is
taken
advantage
of
and
used
by
designing
men
it
is
used
to
send
to
jail
those
who
criticise
existing
things
it
is
used
to
hamper
and
destroy
any
effort
to
change
laws
and
institutions
the
one
who
criticises
conditions
is
a
disturber
and
a
traitor
those
who
profit
by
existing
things
are
always
intense
patriots
and
by
means
of
cheap
appeals
and
trite
expressions
seek
to
stifle
discussion
and
criticism
this
war
has
borne
a
deadly
harvest
of
restrictive
legislation
in
america
we
are
no
longer
an
asylum
for
political
offenders
we
no
longer
stand
for
freedom
of
speech
old
traditions
and
constitutional
and
legal
guarantees
have
been
swept
aside
under
the
hysteria
which
has
prevailed
during
and
since
the
war
these
results
were
inevitable
and
will
follow
war
as
long
as
man
is
man
all
the
of
the
world
war
show
how
completely
man
is
ruled
by
forces
over
which
he
has
no
control
if
considerable
numbers
of
the
people
have
been
moved
by
war
hysteria
and
if
a
large
part
of
crime
is
directly
traceable
to
war
it
seems
plain
that
all
human
action
could
be
traced
to
some
controlling
cause
if
only
man
could
be
wise
enough
and
industrious
and
humane
enough
to
find
the
cause
it
is
plain
that
the
law
of
cause
and
effect
influences
mental
phenomena
as
it
does
physical
acts
and
sometime
perhaps
men
will
seek
to
avoid
the
effect
by
removing
the
cause
xxx
civilization
and
crime
as
children
we
have
all
amused
ourselves
by
looking
into
a
kaleidoscope
turning
it
around
and
around
and
watching
the
changing
patterns
formed
from
the
mixing
bits
of
different
colored
glass
in
the
other
end
each
turn
makes
a
different
pattern
and
each
bit
of
glass
seems
to
seek
a
spot
in
the
general
medley
where
it
can
be
settled
until
another
turn
drives
it
to
find
a
resting
place
somewhere
else
the
organization
of
individual
units
into
a
group
is
more
or
less
such
a
formation
each
seeking
to
adjust
itself
to
a
pattern
and
finding
that
the
pattern
is
and
the
individual
units
obliged
to
seek
new
positions
and
make
new
adjustments
it
is
vain
for
social
theorists
to
talk
of
a
perfect
order
a
system
of
social
organization
that
will
find
the
proper
place
for
each
unit
and
bring
social
symmetry
out
of
the
whole
such
a
society
is
not
consistent
with
the
varied
capacities
and
wants
of
men
neither
is
a
perfect
order
possible
with
and
moving
physical
forces
with
new
mental
conceptions
with
new
needs
and
wants
with
constant
births
and
deaths
and
with
the
innate
instincts
of
man
some
system
may
be
the
best
for
a
time
but
must
in
turn
give
place
to
new
formations
in
this
process
the
old
is
ever
mixed
with
the
new
the
past
hangs
on
to
plague
the
present
and
the
vision
of
the
future
disturbs
the
quiet
and
stability
that
the
present
inherited
from
the
past
organizations
of
society
are
necessary
and
automatic
the
frost
on
the
window
pane
takes
its
pattern
the
crystals
in
the
glass
and
stone
have
their
formations
the
grain
of
sand
the
plant
all
forms
of
animal
life
the
solar
system
and
doubtless
an
infinite
number
of
other
systems
which
the
eye
can
not
see
or
the
mind
comprehend
take
on
form
and
order
the
symmetry
and
shape
of
any
of
these
organizations
may
be
shattered
by
growth
or
catastrophe
and
new
forms
may
take
their
place
all
life
is
constant
friction
and
constant
adjustment
each
particle
in
a
blind
way
trying
to
find
a
more
harmonious
relation
but
never
reaching
complete
rest
the
social
and
political
patterns
that
men
have
taken
have
been
of
many
forms
all
through
the
past
these
have
changed
and
the
laws
and
habits
that
were
meant
to
hold
men
together
have
been
made
and
discarded
as
fast
as
new
emotions
or
ideas
have
gained
the
power
to
make
the
change
men
are
of
all
degrees
of
adaptability
some
can
readily
conform
to
the
new
some
adjust
themselves
very
slowly
man
structure
is
fixed
his
inherent
instincts
are
of
ancient
origin
always
urging
him
to
primitive
reactions
his
habits
are
slowly
formed
and
slowly
changed
slowly
he
settles
himself
to
the
conditions
that
surround
him
he
learns
their
demands
he
manages
to
conform
but
the
that
he
knew
and
the
way
of
life
he
learned
must
be
changed
to
something
else
every
new
adjustment
every
change
of
organization
every
modification
made
by
civilization
bears
its
toll
of
victims
who
have
not
been
able
to
adjust
themselves
to
the
new
order
the
first
criminal
regulations
doubtless
had
to
do
with
the
personal
relations
of
men
the
number
of
offenses
was
small
for
life
was
simple
wants
were
few
and
ambition
rare
the
growth
of
religion
created
a
ferocious
criminal
code
regulating
every
thought
and
action
that
agents
thought
might
offend
the
deity
or
threaten
their
power
on
earth
anyone
interested
in
the
story
of
punishment
for
heresy
sorcery
or
other
crimes
growing
out
of
religious
fanaticism
can
read
the
story
in
lecky
of
rationalism
in
in
white
history
of
the
warfare
of
science
with
theology
in
in
development
of
and
in
many
other
books
the
spanish
inquisition
alone
furnished
about
victims
in
the
two
centuries
of
its
power
many
of
them
were
burned
alive
many
others
were
killed
by
the
most
cruel
torture
that
could
be
devised
by
man
up
to
recent
times
more
victims
have
been
put
to
death
for
heresy
and
kindred
crimes
against
religion
than
for
any
other
cause
next
to
this
no
doubt
stand
political
crimes
even
america
hanged
old
women
for
witchcraft
a
crime
they
could
not
commit
practically
all
the
victims
of
religious
and
political
persecution
have
been
guiltless
of
any
real
crimes
and
among
them
were
always
many
of
the
noblest
of
their
age
every
general
change
of
religious
or
political
ideas
bears
its
quota
of
crimes
for
whatever
the
religious
or
political
organization
it
always
uses
every
means
in
its
power
to
perpetuate
itself
this
is
as
true
of
republics
as
of
monarchies
although
the
severity
of
punishment
and
the
amount
of
heresy
permitted
change
from
time
to
time
each
age
is
sure
that
it
has
the
true
religion
and
the
political
organization
in
every
age
the
accepted
religion
is
true
and
the
king
and
the
state
can
do
no
wrong
one
thing
only
seems
to
be
sure
human
nature
does
not
change
whether
it
was
the
theological
systems
of
the
ancient
world
fighting
to
keep
christianity
out
or
christianity
fighting
to
preserve
itself
the
same
cruel
bigoted
fanatical
majority
has
been
found
to
do
its
will
and
the
same
reasons
and
excuses
have
served
the
law
from
the
earliest
times
down
to
today
a
letter
of
the
younger
pliny
who
was
then
governor
of
a
province
of
rome
asking
the
emperor
trajan
for
instructions
in
dealing
with
the
early
christians
shows
how
persistent
are
intolerance
and
bigotry
this
might
have
been
written
yesterday
to
seek
advice
in
the
suppression
of
opinion
and
punishment
for
sedition
in
any
of
the
most
advanced
governments
of
the
modern
world
as
it
was
in
the
most
advanced
of
the
ancient
world
the
letter
is
here
reproduced
as
an
interesting
exhibit
of
human
nature
and
it
fixity
pliny
the
younger
was
born
in
and
became
governor
of
the
province
of
about
the
year
under
the
emperor
trajan
in
the
discharge
of
his
duties
as
governor
pliny
discovered
that
the
conversion
of
many
of
his
subjects
to
christianity
had
resulted
in
a
falling
off
of
trade
in
the
victims
usually
purchased
for
sacrifices
at
the
temples
and
in
other
commodities
used
in
connection
with
pagan
worship
as
a
good
governor
pliny
sought
to
remedy
this
economic
situation
and
his
plan
was
to
restore
his
subjects
to
their
old
forms
of
worship
thus
he
was
brought
into
contact
with
christianity
the
following
letters
one
from
pliny
to
trajan
and
the
other
trajan
reply
show
the
situation
these
documents
are
from
the
tenth
book
of
pliny
correspondence
letters
and
pliny
asking
instructions
of
trajan
on
trials
of
christians
it
is
my
invariable
rule
sir
to
refer
to
you
in
all
matters
where
i
feel
doubtful
for
who
is
more
capable
of
removing
my
scruples
or
informing
my
ignorance
having
never
been
present
at
any
trials
concerning
those
who
profess
christianity
i
am
unacquainted
not
only
with
the
nature
of
their
crimes
or
the
measure
of
their
punishment
but
how
far
it
is
proper
to
enter
into
an
examination
concerning
them
whether
therefore
any
difference
is
usually
made
with
respect
to
ages
or
no
distinction
is
to
be
observed
between
the
young
and
the
adult
whether
repentance
entitles
them
to
a
pardon
or
if
a
man
has
been
once
a
christian
it
avails
nothing
to
desist
from
his
error
whether
the
very
profession
of
christianity
unattended
with
any
criminal
act
or
only
the
crimes
themselves
inherent
in
the
profession
are
punishable
on
all
these
points
i
am
in
great
doubt
in
the
meanwhile
the
method
i
have
observed
towards
those
who
have
been
brought
before
me
as
christians
is
this
i
asked
them
whether
they
were
christians
if
they
admitted
it
i
repeated
the
question
twice
and
threatened
them
with
punishment
if
they
persisted
i
ordered
them
to
be
at
once
punished
for
i
was
persuaded
whatever
the
nature
of
their
opinions
might
be
a
contumacious
and
inflexible
obstinacy
certainly
deserved
correction
there
were
others
also
brought
before
me
possessed
with
the
same
infatuation
but
being
roman
citizens
i
directed
them
to
be
sent
to
rome
but
this
crime
spreading
as
is
usually
the
case
while
it
was
actually
under
prosecution
several
instances
of
the
same
nature
occurred
an
anonymous
information
was
laid
before
me
containing
a
charge
against
several
persons
who
upon
examination
denied
they
were
christians
or
had
ever
been
so
they
repeated
after
me
an
invocation
to
the
gods
and
offered
religious
rites
with
wine
and
incense
before
your
statue
which
for
that
purpose
i
had
ordered
to
be
brought
together
with
those
of
the
gods
and
even
reviled
the
name
of
christ
whereas
there
is
no
forcing
it
is
said
those
who
are
really
christians
into
any
of
these
compliances
i
thought
it
proper
therefore
to
discharge
them
some
among
those
who
were
accused
by
a
witness
in
person
at
first
confessed
themselves
christians
but
immediately
after
denied
it
the
rest
owned
indeed
that
they
had
been
of
that
number
formerly
but
had
now
some
above
three
others
more
and
a
few
above
twenty
years
ago
renounced
that
error
they
all
worshipped
your
statue
and
the
images
of
the
gods
uttering
imprecations
at
the
same
time
against
the
name
of
christ
they
affirmed
the
whole
of
their
guilt
or
their
error
was
that
they
met
on
a
stated
day
before
it
was
light
and
addressed
a
form
of
prayer
to
christ
as
to
a
divinity
binding
themselves
by
a
solemn
oath
not
for
the
purposes
of
any
wicked
design
but
never
to
commit
any
fraud
theft
or
adultery
never
to
falsify
their
word
nor
deny
a
trust
when
they
should
be
called
upon
to
deliver
it
up
after
which
it
was
their
custom
to
separate
and
then
to
eat
in
common
a
harmless
meal
from
this
custom
however
they
desisted
after
the
publication
of
my
edict
by
which
according
to
your
commands
i
forbade
the
meeting
of
any
assemblies
after
receiving
this
account
i
judged
it
so
much
the
more
necessary
to
endeavor
to
extort
the
real
truth
by
putting
two
female
slaves
to
the
torture
who
were
said
to
officiate
in
their
religious
rites
but
all
i
could
discover
was
evidence
of
an
absurd
and
extravagant
superstition
i
deemed
it
expedient
therefore
to
adjourn
all
further
proceedings
in
order
to
consult
you
for
it
appears
to
be
a
matter
highly
deserving
your
consideration
more
especially
as
great
numbers
must
be
involved
in
the
danger
of
these
prosecutions
which
have
already
extended
and
are
still
likely
to
extend
to
persons
of
all
ranks
and
ages
and
even
of
both
sexes
in
fact
this
contagious
superstition
is
not
confined
to
the
cities
only
but
has
spread
its
infection
among
the
neighboring
villages
and
country
nevertheless
it
still
seems
possible
to
restrain
its
progress
the
temples
at
least
which
were
once
almost
deserted
begin
now
to
be
frequented
and
the
sacred
rites
after
a
long
intermission
are
again
revived
while
there
is
a
general
demand
for
the
victims
which
till
lately
found
very
few
purchasers
from
all
this
it
is
easy
to
conjecture
what
numbers
might
be
reclaimed
if
a
general
pardon
were
granted
to
those
who
shall
repent
of
their
error
trajan
to
pliny
you
have
adopted
a
right
course
my
dearest
secundus
in
investigating
the
charges
against
the
christians
who
were
brought
before
you
it
is
not
possible
to
lay
down
any
general
rule
for
all
such
cases
do
not
go
out
of
your
way
to
look
for
them
if
indeed
they
should
be
brought
before
you
and
the
crime
is
proved
they
must
be
punished
with
the
restriction
however
that
where
the
party
denies
he
is
a
christian
and
shall
make
it
evident
that
he
is
not
by
invoking
our
gods
let
him
notwithstanding
any
former
suspicion
be
pardoned
upon
his
repentance
anonymous
information
ought
not
to
be
received
in
any
sort
of
prosecution
it
is
introducing
a
very
dangerous
precedent
and
is
quite
foreign
to
the
spirit
of
our
age
civilization
is
largely
a
question
of
new
machinery
and
methods
it
is
not
the
humanizing
of
men
it
is
plain
that
no
matter
what
the
time
or
age
the
characteristics
of
man
remain
the
same
his
structure
does
not
change
his
emotional
life
can
not
change
new
objects
and
desires
may
control
his
feeling
but
whatever
the
aim
of
the
age
and
place
the
same
inherent
emotions
control
intolerance
has
been
one
of
the
great
sources
of
evil
all
down
the
ages
it
is
practically
certain
that
neither
time
nor
education
has
made
man
more
kindly
in
his
judgment
of
his
fellows
or
more
tolerant
in
his
opinions
and
life
all
that
education
can
do
is
to
remove
some
of
the
inducing
causes
that
have
always
brought
the
sharp
conflicts
and
awakened
the
cruelty
of
man
every
civilization
brings
new
evils
and
new
complexities
which
man
meets
with
the
same
machine
and
the
same
emotions
it
is
fairly
certain
that
no
nobler
idealism
or
no
finer
feelings
have
been
planted
or
cultivated
in
man
since
the
dawn
of
history
and
when
it
is
thoroughly
realized
that
man
structure
is
fixed
and
can
not
be
changed
it
seems
as
if
none
could
be
developed
xxxi
the
convict
human
nature
is
so
weak
and
imperfect
that
at
its
best
it
needs
all
the
encouragement
it
can
get
the
comradeship
of
friends
and
the
attitude
of
the
public
and
acquaintances
are
of
the
greatest
importance
in
effecting
the
development
of
most
lives
sooner
or
later
the
convicted
man
is
turned
out
either
on
probation
or
parole
or
at
the
expiration
of
his
sentence
he
was
probably
none
too
strong
a
man
before
his
conviction
his
heredity
was
poor
in
most
cases
and
his
environment
completed
his
downfall
he
faces
the
world
again
with
a
serious
handicap
that
he
did
not
have
at
first
if
he
had
just
recovered
from
a
severe
illness
everyone
he
met
would
do
all
he
could
to
help
him
his
environment
would
be
made
easier
than
before
his
confinement
in
the
hospital
and
especially
from
the
conditions
that
placed
him
there
both
society
and
his
neighbors
would
try
to
see
that
he
should
as
far
as
possible
be
saved
if
he
had
been
one
of
those
who
could
live
only
by
means
of
his
own
work
and
if
on
account
of
himself
or
his
family
he
had
been
obliged
to
an
easier
place
would
probably
be
found
for
him
the
chances
of
going
to
the
hospital
the
second
time
would
be
very
much
less
than
they
were
the
first
time
even
his
experience
in
confinement
would
be
of
use
and
through
that
experience
he
would
be
taught
to
live
and
preserve
his
health
the
discharged
prisoner
is
met
in
an
entirely
different
way
the
is
under
doubt
and
suspicion
from
the
start
on
the
slightest
provocation
he
is
reminded
of
his
past
he
is
always
under
suspicion
unless
perhaps
he
professes
a
change
of
heart
such
a
change
implies
a
physical
process
which
is
impossible
some
sudden
exaltation
may
furnish
him
a
new
emotion
for
a
time
but
this
can
last
only
while
the
stimulus
has
power
to
act
it
will
soon
pass
away
and
the
man
will
be
himself
again
it
may
be
possible
that
here
and
there
is
a
nature
of
such
an
emotional
temperament
that
religion
or
socialism
or
single
tax
or
some
other
strong
conviction
may
possess
him
until
such
time
as
his
feelings
begin
to
cool
and
change
when
he
will
be
safe
but
most
men
are
inherently
the
same
when
they
come
out
of
prison
as
when
they
go
in
under
right
treatment
they
may
gain
a
little
more
wisdom
as
to
life
that
will
help
them
make
adjustments
or
they
may
be
relieved
from
some
burdens
or
placed
in
an
environment
of
less
stress
and
strain
where
it
will
be
easier
to
live
in
those
cases
the
attitude
and
help
of
the
community
are
society
is
not
entirely
to
blame
for
looking
on
him
with
suspicion
it
knows
he
once
failed
it
has
been
taught
that
this
failure
was
due
to
a
moral
delinquency
outside
the
law
of
cause
and
effect
and
society
is
naturally
suspicious
that
he
will
offend
again
or
molest
the
community
in
some
other
way
had
he
been
confined
because
he
had
not
the
strength
to
meet
his
environment
had
the
law
put
him
in
custody
under
expert
control
until
he
gained
the
strength
for
his
battle
with
life
or
had
a
new
environment
been
provided
under
scientific
direction
as
in
the
case
of
a
hospital
patient
society
would
then
take
another
view
and
do
all
it
could
to
help
him
new
comrades
and
associates
would
surround
him
to
show
him
the
way
and
they
would
make
his
burden
lighter
instead
of
this
he
comes
out
with
his
ability
to
adjust
himself
to
life
lessened
if
a
crime
is
committed
in
his
community
he
is
blamed
or
at
least
suspected
he
is
known
to
the
police
and
often
this
directly
interferes
with
his
employment
places
him
at
a
disadvantage
with
his
associates
and
drives
him
into
the
company
of
others
who
feel
that
the
world
is
against
them
and
that
a
life
of
crime
is
all
there
is
left
to
follow
it
is
not
hard
to
see
how
men
come
to
be
repeaters
it
is
hard
to
understand
when
they
do
not
xxxii
isolation
and
sterilization
the
growing
belief
that
crime
comes
largely
from
the
subnormal
has
created
a
more
or
less
definite
demand
for
the
isolation
of
the
moron
before
the
commission
of
crime
and
for
the
sterilization
of
certain
misfits
especially
after
conviction
both
of
these
methods
are
very
drastic
and
while
society
must
and
will
adopt
any
way
that
seems
to
be
necessary
to
protect
itself
still
before
accepting
such
drastic
remedies
it
should
be
very
clear
that
the
danger
is
sufficiently
great
to
justify
the
means
that
the
desired
result
will
follow
and
that
no
other
means
will
bring
about
the
end
in
this
discussion
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
mental
classification
of
children
and
is
only
in
its
infancy
that
much
that
is
freely
stated
is
still
in
the
realm
of
theory
and
that
time
and
patience
in
making
investigations
and
classifying
facts
are
most
important
in
arriving
at
correct
results
the
really
intelligent
are
as
abnormal
as
the
defective
the
great
masses
of
men
are
rather
mediocre
and
those
above
and
below
are
exceptions
this
depends
on
how
broad
is
the
class
included
in
the
normal
there
are
no
sharp
divisions
anywhere
above
the
normal
shades
imperceptibly
into
those
of
unusual
intelligence
and
below
it
fades
just
as
gradually
into
the
while
defectives
are
more
apt
to
commit
crimes
in
the
main
this
is
because
their
environment
is
too
hard
for
their
machine
the
are
probably
more
tractable
and
less
disposed
to
the
emotions
that
lead
to
criminal
acts
than
are
the
more
intelligent
their
crimes
are
especially
noticed
because
they
seem
to
be
without
any
serious
motive
and
often
shockingly
brutal
city
life
most
readily
uncovers
the
this
is
true
because
the
strain
is
far
greater
in
the
city
than
the
country
there
are
exceptions
to
this
rule
particularly
those
portions
of
the
country
that
are
barren
and
unproductive
territory
into
which
the
venturesome
and
obvious
unfits
are
drawn
the
prisons
are
not
the
only
places
which
are
inhabited
by
the
and
the
misfit
the
hardest
and
most
disagreeable
and
most
poorly
paid
labor
is
largely
done
by
this
class
of
people
very
few
people
of
superior
intelligence
and
education
do
manual
labor
and
the
more
disagreeable
the
manual
labor
the
more
certain
it
is
that
the
job
is
done
by
the
and
the
misfit
a
large
part
of
the
farm
labor
the
odd
jobs
and
common
labor
in
small
towns
the
cheaper
labor
on
railroads
in
factories
and
all
industrial
plants
is
given
to
this
sort
of
men
in
the
country
and
small
village
where
life
is
easy
this
class
seldom
makes
trouble
and
is
hardly
known
these
men
and
women
easily
and
naturally
fall
into
a
place
in
the
industry
and
society
of
the
village
and
are
often
among
the
most
useful
members
a
general
examination
of
all
men
to
discover
the
defective
and
the
coupled
with
a
demand
that
all
such
be
sent
to
some
place
of
confinement
would
meet
with
such
a
protest
from
all
classes
seriously
affected
as
to
end
not
only
the
demand
but
the
further
agitation
of
the
subject
any
such
law
if
carried
out
would
not
only
seriously
increase
the
cost
of
all
industry
but
in
many
instances
would
make
it
impossible
to
carry
it
on
it
is
hardly
conceivable
that
above
the
idiot
society
shall
make
examinations
and
tests
and
confine
or
sterilize
large
classes
of
people
who
have
not
yet
developed
tendencies
but
who
on
account
of
feeble
intellects
might
sometime
commit
crime
the
world
has
ample
data
at
hand
to
show
more
humane
and
at
the
same
time
much
cheaper
ways
even
methods
that
will
yield
a
profit
these
ways
have
been
abundantly
illustrated
by
history
and
can
be
witnessed
in
operation
every
day
england
was
repeatedly
conquered
and
settled
by
brigands
and
misfits
when
her
people
grew
more
homogeneous
and
orderly
she
sent
her
to
new
zealand
and
to
virginia
in
new
zealand
with
its
opportunities
these
outcasts
and
their
descendants
prospered
and
were
as
orderly
and
conventional
as
the
english
society
that
banished
them
for
england
good
the
colonies
in
virginia
with
access
to
land
and
a
chance
to
make
homes
for
themselves
established
a
social
order
and
formed
communities
more
prosperous
than
the
ones
that
sent
them
out
many
of
their
descendants
are
now
successful
and
important
members
of
every
western
state
in
fact
most
of
the
european
immigrants
who
have
settled
in
the
united
states
were
the
poor
and
the
outcast
the
misfits
of
european
countries
with
better
opportunities
and
a
chance
to
build
up
homes
in
a
new
land
their
descendants
are
at
least
the
equals
of
those
who
stayed
behind
the
growth
and
development
of
the
united
states
westward
from
the
atlantic
seaboard
has
been
effected
by
the
poorer
and
less
intelligent
but
often
the
more
venturesome
who
constantly
turned
west
to
get
cheaper
land
and
a
better
chance
the
residents
of
these
western
states
compare
very
favorably
with
those
who
still
reside
in
the
sections
of
the
country
which
these
pioneers
left
behind
it
can
not
be
shown
that
the
less
intelligent
have
criminal
natures
all
that
can
be
shown
is
that
they
have
a
poorer
equipment
to
meet
the
stress
and
strain
of
life
to
make
most
of
this
class
safe
all
that
is
needed
is
fairer
conditions
and
an
easier
environment
if
society
could
only
recover
from
the
obsession
that
what
is
necessary
to
regulate
man
is
plenty
of
prisons
and
harder
punishments
it
would
be
fairly
easy
and
infinitely
cheaper
to
improve
the
environment
from
which
crime
springs
than
to
visit
vengeance
on
the
victim
the
effect
of
education
is
very
great
many
a
subnormal
and
backward
person
has
been
educated
so
he
could
take
a
place
in
life
that
those
with
a
much
greater
natural
ability
could
not
fill
beyond
the
segregation
of
the
imbecile
the
insane
and
those
who
have
committed
crime
it
is
dangerous
to
go
the
course
of
preventing
crime
lies
in
the
other
direction
better
opportunity
and
an
easier
life
it
has
grown
to
be
a
commonplace
in
the
discussion
of
crime
to
speak
of
isolation
and
sterilization
as
the
proper
treatment
of
the
criminal
and
defective
this
is
generally
done
without
any
clear
understanding
of
the
laws
of
heredity
the
laws
of
the
transmission
from
parent
to
child
of
traits
and
tendencies
are
not
yet
well
enough
known
to
justify
any
attempt
to
interfere
with
the
function
of
life
except
in
the
case
of
the
idiotic
it
is
plain
that
crime
can
not
be
inherited
certain
defects
in
the
brain
and
nervous
system
can
be
and
are
inherited
no
brain
or
nervous
system
is
perfect
so
the
problem
is
one
of
the
incapacity
which
causes
the
maladjustment
crime
results
from
defective
heredity
when
applied
to
the
environment
it
comes
from
the
inability
of
the
machine
to
make
the
necessary
adjustments
of
life
the
making
of
the
criminal
is
largely
a
question
of
his
fortune
or
misfortune
in
the
environment
where
he
is
placed
it
is
absurd
to
say
that
one
inherits
the
tendency
to
rob
or
rape
or
burglarize
or
kill
he
may
inherit
an
unstable
organization
that
in
certain
hostile
environments
will
lead
him
to
any
of
these
crimes
for
that
matter
all
men
inherit
the
organization
that
will
bring
these
results
if
the
environment
is
sufficiently
hard
society
may
in
many
ways
place
too
high
a
value
on
human
life
still
we
punish
men
who
place
too
low
a
value
on
the
lives
of
others
and
the
state
should
be
very
slow
to
destroy
life
or
the
capacity
for
life
there
is
much
to
learn
much
to
explain
about
the
mysterious
workings
of
heredity
before
man
can
undertake
to
say
that
he
has
the
wisdom
or
justice
to
choose
the
ones
who
should
be
the
bearers
of
life
to
the
future
it
is
most
common
to
find
in
the
same
family
various
degrees
of
intelligence
now
and
then
a
man
of
such
high
powers
and
faculties
is
born
that
he
is
regarded
by
scientists
as
a
sport
who
defies
all
known
laws
in
his
origin
often
one
person
in
a
family
is
of
commanding
strength
while
the
rest
are
commonplace
the
insanity
and
disease
that
afflict
many
men
of
genius
is
well
known
grasset
in
his
book
and
the
has
given
a
long
list
of
eminent
names
many
great
authors
have
depicted
insanity
in
their
most
gifted
characters
genius
is
frequently
an
indication
of
insanity
it
is
a
wide
departure
from
the
normal
the
obscure
and
lowly
origin
of
many
of
the
world
greatest
men
seems
to
point
to
the
fact
that
nature
has
methods
that
man
can
not
comprehend
and
with
which
it
is
not
wise
for
him
to
interfere
the
fact
is
that
genius
or
even
great
strength
or
ability
in
the
parent
is
by
no
means
sure
to
be
handed
down
in
fact
it
is
very
rare
indeed
that
such
unusual
traits
persist
that
sterilization
should
follow
as
a
punishment
for
sex
crimes
is
without
any
sort
of
logic
except
that
sterilization
relates
to
sex
the
whole
idea
is
born
of
the
hatred
or
loathing
of
certain
crimes
generalizations
have
been
made
from
a
few
poorly
authenticated
cases
and
these
generalizations
have
gone
far
beyond
anything
that
the
evidence
can
justify
it
does
not
follow
that
because
the
father
and
son
have
black
hair
or
the
mother
and
daughter
have
blue
eyes
or
that
their
mannerisms
are
similar
that
inheritance
is
responsible
for
character
much
less
for
crime
certain
things
are
clearly
traceable
to
heredity
other
things
may
be
the
result
of
association
or
what
to
us
must
still
be
accident
often
the
fact
is
pointed
out
that
great
progress
has
been
made
in
the
culture
of
plants
and
the
breeding
of
animals
this
is
true
no
intelligent
farmer
would
think
of
raising
any
but
the
best
stock
he
takes
pains
with
the
breeding
of
his
cattle
if
he
wants
rich
milk
and
butter
he
breeds
jerseys
or
guernseys
if
he
wants
a
larger
quantity
of
milk
and
a
fair
beef
animal
he
breeds
holsteins
if
he
wants
beef
only
perhaps
he
raises
durhams
at
any
rate
he
knows
what
he
wants
and
breeds
that
kind
similarly
the
will
breed
for
race
horses
or
dray
horses
as
the
case
may
be
and
the
system
works
with
almost
mechanical
certainty
he
gets
what
he
wants
and
would
never
think
of
raising
scrubs
and
taking
a
chance
on
results
the
effect
of
selective
breeding
and
culture
is
beyond
dispute
and
to
many
it
seems
obvious
that
all
that
is
needed
to
perfect
the
human
race
and
wipe
out
misery
and
crime
is
to
supervise
human
breeding
in
the
same
way
so
that
the
species
may
be
controlled
at
first
glance
this
seems
to
be
the
logical
thing
to
do
especially
as
the
effects
of
heredity
can
no
more
be
doubted
in
man
than
in
animals
still
there
are
important
questions
to
be
asked
and
grave
dangers
to
be
encountered
when
we
say
that
the
berkshire
hog
is
better
than
the
we
mean
that
it
will
produce
more
meat
for
food
in
other
words
the
hog
is
better
for
man
if
we
were
to
ask
which
would
be
the
better
if
the
hog
were
to
be
considered
the
answer
would
probably
be
the
the
fact
that
the
food
consumed
by
the
berkshire
produces
a
large
quantity
of
fat
makes
him
unfitted
to
live
if
he
were
living
for
his
own
sake
turn
both
hogs
out
to
run
wild
and
the
will
live
and
the
berkshire
die
nature
will
make
her
selection
and
adapt
the
hog
to
his
environment
the
berkshire
will
produce
more
lard
but
it
will
not
run
so
fast
it
has
no
more
brains
and
can
not
adapt
what
it
has
so
well
to
the
preservation
of
life
the
same
thing
is
doubtless
true
of
other
animals
and
likewise
of
plant
life
the
jersey
cow
would
not
survive
in
a
natural
state
she
gives
too
much
milk
and
for
too
long
a
time
man
has
made
of
her
a
turn
all
thoroughbred
horses
out
on
the
plains
to
shift
for
themselves
and
they
would
either
die
or
gradually
be
modified
until
they
were
adapted
to
the
free
and
wild
life
of
the
plains
this
would
not
be
so
good
for
man
but
would
be
better
for
the
horses
in
plants
and
animals
man
can
by
selection
breed
or
cultivate
any
characteristics
that
he
may
choose
but
he
can
not
produce
a
horse
which
is
both
a
draft
horse
and
a
running
horse
he
can
not
produce
cattle
that
are
the
best
both
for
milk
and
beef
he
is
urged
to
try
scientific
breeding
on
the
human
race
how
would
he
have
man
changed
would
he
experiment
for
more
intellect
or
a
bigger
and
stronger
physique
would
he
breed
for
art
and
civilization
or
would
he
breed
for
strength
and
physical
endurance
what
qualities
are
desirable
for
the
human
race
this
would
be
a
very
hard
question
even
to
entrust
to
a
popular
vote
while
the
capacity
of
cattle
to
produce
milk
can
be
increased
cattle
can
not
increase
their
own
capacity
or
improve
their
own
quality
this
can
be
done
only
by
the
slow
and
patient
processes
of
nature
in
the
line
of
adapting
the
animal
to
its
environment
the
rapid
change
that
is
to
come
about
by
breeding
must
be
directed
and
controlled
by
man
the
cattle
have
nothing
to
say
about
the
process
no
doubt
a
higher
order
of
beings
who
could
control
man
might
and
perhaps
would
change
him
by
selective
mating
how
they
would
change
him
would
depend
on
the
use
they
wished
to
make
of
him
not
on
what
the
man
himself
would
like
to
do
the
contemplation
of
a
higher
order
of
beings
experimenting
with
the
human
race
is
not
a
pleasant
one
for
intelligent
men
can
we
imagine
men
through
government
forcibly
experimenting
with
each
other
who
would
settle
the
kind
of
man
that
was
to
be
evolved
or
the
specific
changes
that
would
be
required
or
what
was
to
be
done
and
how
who
could
prophesy
what
man
would
be
like
when
he
should
be
made
over
in
the
likeness
of
something
else
who
are
the
people
with
the
breadth
and
tolerance
and
infinite
wisdom
in
whose
hands
it
would
be
safe
to
place
the
remodeling
of
man
it
is
hard
to
conceive
that
it
can
be
seriously
considered
nature
in
her
own
way
is
a
eugenist
by
her
slow
processes
she
is
continually
wiping
out
the
unfit
and
adapting
man
to
the
environment
where
he
must
live
perhaps
by
saving
too
many
of
the
unfit
man
is
more
or
less
interfering
with
the
processes
of
nature
and
it
may
be
that
the
interference
with
her
method
of
work
is
bad
but
nature
is
mindful
of
this
tendency
and
if
it
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
profoundest
laws
of
being
nature
will
have
her
way
in
spite
of
man
meddling
any
change
that
can
be
brought
about
by
selective
mating
must
come
by
natural
processes
aided
by
the
education
of
each
individual
through
a
closer
study
of
the
origin
and
evolution
of
life
this
must
leave
everyone
free
to
do
his
own
selecting
rather
than
to
trust
it
to
the
state
society
can
do
much
toward
giving
man
an
environment
which
will
more
or
less
be
adjusted
to
his
heredity
to
give
him
a
heredity
that
will
conform
to
his
environment
is
quite
another
thing
and
probably
must
be
kept
practically
free
from
the
theories
vagaries
and
experiments
of
man
it
would
seem
so
absurd
and
dangerous
as
not
to
be
worth
discussing
except
for
the
fact
that
the
movement
both
for
sterilizing
and
some
degree
of
control
of
mating
has
already
gone
far
in
some
of
the
states
there
is
no
limit
that
fanaticism
or
hatred
will
respect
no
doubt
the
popular
opinion
that
in
some
way
crime
and
pauperism
are
inherited
has
been
strengthened
by
the
literature
concerning
the
family
that
has
been
given
the
name
of
the
jukes
the
first
extensive
study
of
this
family
was
made
by
richard
dugdale
who
was
connected
with
the
new
york
prison
association
it
was
first
published
in
and
may
almost
be
regarded
as
the
uncle
tom
cabin
of
the
scientific
study
of
crime
in
america
dugdale
was
evidently
a
careful
student
an
honest
investigator
and
a
humane
man
strange
to
say
deductions
have
been
freely
and
carelessly
made
from
his
book
which
the
investigations
do
not
warrant
and
against
which
he
carefully
cautioned
the
reader
no
one
can
examine
dugdale
book
without
being
impressed
with
the
quiet
unassuming
modesty
and
worth
of
the
author
and
yet
in
the
hands
of
those
who
have
so
often
carelessly
and
unscientifically
generalized
from
his
studies
it
has
possibly
brought
more
harm
than
good
the
book
covers
investigations
made
by
dugdale
between
and
a
period
in
which
little
was
known
about
the
laws
that
govern
inheritance
and
necessarily
much
evidence
was
pure
hearsay
without
the
data
of
careful
investigation
at
hand
the
case
however
does
show
a
surprising
number
of
criminals
paupers
harlots
and
misfits
descending
from
their
original
ancestor
from
time
to
time
further
investigation
has
brought
the
history
of
the
family
down
to
the
ancestor
with
whom
the
investigation
begins
was
born
some
time
between
and
in
the
report
the
original
is
called
max
he
has
been
described
as
a
hunter
and
fisher
a
hard
drinker
not
fond
of
work
fairly
intelligent
and
leaving
no
record
of
crime
he
probably
left
behind
a
large
family
some
of
whom
were
legitimate
and
some
illegitimate
the
family
came
from
a
barren
rocky
lake
region
in
new
york
and
several
generations
grew
up
in
the
vicinity
the
only
industry
was
rough
work
like
quarrying
stone
logging
and
the
like
later
a
manufacturing
plant
was
located
in
the
region
the
jukes
early
got
a
bad
name
in
the
small
community
even
when
they
wanted
to
find
employment
it
was
hard
to
get
a
job
they
were
socially
ostracized
and
individually
boycotted
the
region
was
poor
and
for
the
most
part
the
family
grew
up
in
poverty
often
several
members
of
a
family
lived
in
one
room
and
slept
on
the
floor
indiscriminately
regardless
of
sex
for
several
generations
few
of
them
wandered
far
from
the
ancestral
home
the
locality
was
one
that
naturally
came
to
be
the
resort
of
the
poor
and
the
outcast
these
are
always
driven
to
the
cheapest
and
most
barren
land
whether
the
community
was
related
by
blood
or
not
the
residents
would
almost
inevitably
be
of
the
same
class
rich
people
cluster
closely
together
for
association
and
fellowship
the
poor
and
wretched
do
the
same
common
observation
in
city
and
country
shows
that
this
is
inevitable
it
comes
from
deeper
and
more
fundamental
laws
than
human
statutes
it
is
born
of
the
gregarious
instinct
and
fostered
and
developed
by
economic
law
in
the
main
lax
habits
grow
from
surroundings
and
association
the
tendency
of
all
human
beings
is
to
revert
to
the
primal
it
is
only
association
that
keeps
the
individual
units
up
to
the
tension
that
civilization
expects
and
demands
every
community
shows
many
examples
of
this
inevitable
tendency
nature
is
constant
civilization
spasmodic
especially
with
sex
relations
conditions
are
the
chief
factor
nature
knows
little
or
nothing
of
the
regulations
fixed
by
society
and
custom
poverty
and
wretchedness
reach
outward
through
a
community
and
by
association
between
the
old
and
the
young
pass
down
the
generations
nothing
but
a
complete
change
of
environment
can
counteract
the
inevitable
tendency
when
social
classes
arise
and
the
cleavage
is
clear
and
established
no
great
effort
is
made
by
the
superior
members
to
aid
the
inferior
in
fact
they
are
almost
invariably
left
to
themselves
poverty
and
wretchedness
are
not
transmitted
in
the
blood
but
in
the
environment
it
is
not
many
years
since
physicians
and
communities
believed
that
tuberculosis
was
inherited
in
all
communities
there
were
instances
of
this
dread
disease
spreading
out
through
families
and
down
the
generations
it
required
the
sacrifice
of
many
lives
and
the
careful
investigation
of
scientists
to
discover
that
tuberculosis
was
the
result
of
germs
generally
accompanied
by
an
impoverished
system
these
germs
were
transferred
by
close
association
and
lack
of
sanitary
conditions
it
is
as
easy
to
transmit
shiftlessness
idleness
and
lax
habits
as
disease
dugdale
figures
of
delinquency
in
the
jukes
family
are
doubtless
much
too
high
a
large
percentage
of
facts
was
gained
from
gossip
and
hearsay
about
those
long
since
dead
the
details
show
that
many
crimes
charged
were
not
even
proved
others
were
evidently
not
crimes
and
in
any
small
community
suspicion
would
rest
upon
a
member
of
this
family
who
was
accused
then
too
the
poor
in
court
and
out
have
a
hard
time
defending
themselves
they
are
frequently
convicted
when
accused
the
evidence
in
regard
to
the
subnormal
and
defective
is
still
less
satisfactory
without
close
examination
and
thorough
tests
illiteracy
generally
passes
as
subnormality
very
few
of
the
subjects
were
submitted
to
a
careful
test
it
is
at
least
probable
that
this
family
was
not
much
different
from
the
other
families
who
lived
in
like
circumstances
in
the
community
dugdale
original
examination
covered
cases
out
of
about
that
were
supposed
to
be
living
at
the
time
of
this
number
are
put
down
as
having
received
institutional
and
outdoor
relief
the
criminals
and
offenders
are
put
down
at
habitual
thieves
convicted
and
unconvicted
are
listed
at
common
prostitutes
are
put
down
at
after
dugdale
investigation
the
family
from
industrial
and
other
conditions
became
scattered
and
spread
out
over
many
states
a
record
has
lately
been
made
of
the
descendants
of
this
family
the
later
record
showing
much
improvement
in
the
stock
this
must
be
due
to
environment
it
seems
fairly
certain
that
with
time
and
opportunity
it
will
not
much
longer
be
a
marked
family
quite
aside
from
the
history
it
seems
certain
that
no
results
such
as
shown
by
dugdale
could
have
followed
from
inheritance
defectiveness
is
a
recessive
factor
normality
a
dominant
one
if
such
were
not
true
this
would
be
a
world
of
if
the
mendelian
law
held
good
in
this
regard
from
a
union
of
a
defective
and
a
normal
person
three
out
of
four
would
be
normal
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
percentage
of
normal
is
no
doubt
much
greater
it
is
only
when
both
father
and
mother
are
that
is
sure
to
show
in
the
offspring
with
the
modern
care
of
this
sort
of
defectives
the
chance
of
breeding
is
growing
rapidly
less
the
kallikak
family
is
cited
as
another
illustration
showing
the
possible
inheritance
of
criminality
and
poverty
through
a
defective
strain
this
family
so
far
as
shown
makes
it
still
clearer
that
what
some
authors
have
charged
to
heredity
is
simply
due
to
environment
these
investigations
do
not
show
the
need
of
controlling
birth
but
do
prove
the
necessity
of
improving
environment
it
is
not
possible
to
speak
with
certainty
as
to
heredity
and
environment
the
thorough
investigation
of
these
two
factors
which
make
up
life
is
still
in
its
infancy
but
scientists
are
working
out
the
problem
and
we
may
be
confident
that
with
the
right
attitude
toward
crime
a
remedy
will
be
found
for
such
cases
as
result
from
environment
xxxiii
crime
disease
and
accident
the
criminologist
has
always
looked
for
the
cause
of
crime
in
some
other
direction
than
in
the
inherent
wickedness
of
the
criminal
only
those
who
make
and
enforce
the
law
believe
that
men
commit
crimes
because
they
choose
the
wrong
different
writers
have
made
their
catalogues
of
causes
that
are
responsible
for
crime
and
most
of
these
lists
are
more
or
less
correct
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
more
crimes
against
property
are
committed
in
cold
weather
than
in
warm
weather
more
in
hard
times
than
in
good
times
more
by
the
unemployed
than
the
employed
more
during
strikes
and
lockouts
than
in
times
of
industrial
peace
more
when
food
is
expensive
and
scarce
than
when
it
is
cheap
and
plenty
more
in
short
when
it
is
harder
to
live
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
are
more
crimes
of
violence
in
extreme
hot
weather
than
in
cold
weather
that
is
heat
affects
crimes
as
it
affects
disease
and
insanity
and
death
in
short
as
it
affects
all
life
more
crimes
of
violence
are
committed
after
wars
or
during
heated
political
campaigns
than
at
other
times
more
of
such
crimes
when
either
by
climatic
or
other
conditions
feelings
are
intensified
or
aroused
and
less
subject
to
control
likewise
there
are
more
crimes
committed
by
young
men
between
seventeen
and
twenty
four
or
five
years
of
age
than
at
any
other
age
neither
the
very
young
nor
the
old
commit
crimes
except
in
rare
cases
all
the
old
people
could
be
safely
dismissed
from
prisons
some
few
of
the
senile
would
need
attention
and
many
need
support
and
care
but
none
is
dangerous
to
the
community
there
can
be
no
question
that
practically
all
criminals
are
poor
even
when
bankers
get
into
prison
they
almost
never
have
much
money
when
they
start
that
way
and
none
when
they
arrive
they
are
sent
for
something
that
would
not
have
happened
except
for
financial
disaster
there
is
no
longer
any
question
that
a
large
number
say
probably
from
ten
to
twenty
per
cent
of
the
convicted
are
in
fact
insane
at
the
time
the
act
was
committed
and
that
the
demented
the
imbecile
and
the
clearly
subnormal
constitute
many
more
than
half
of
the
inmates
of
prisons
most
of
the
rest
can
be
accounted
for
by
defective
nervous
systems
excessively
strong
instincts
in
some
directions
weak
ones
in
another
or
a
very
hard
environment
add
to
this
the
facts
that
only
a
few
have
ever
had
any
education
worthy
of
the
name
that
most
of
them
have
never
been
trained
to
make
a
fair
living
by
any
trade
or
occupation
that
almost
all
have
had
a
poor
early
environment
with
no
chance
from
the
first
and
most
of
them
have
had
a
very
imperfect
heredity
in
short
sufficient
statistics
have
been
gathered
and
enough
is
known
to
warrant
the
belief
that
every
case
of
crime
could
be
accounted
for
on
purely
scientific
grounds
if
all
the
facts
bearing
on
the
case
were
known
is
there
anything
unreasonable
in
all
of
this
is
it
outside
of
the
other
manifestations
of
life
let
us
take
disease
clearly
this
is
affected
by
heat
and
cold
beyond
question
it
is
largely
the
result
of
inherited
susceptibilities
poverty
or
wealth
has
much
to
do
with
disease
many
poor
people
die
of
tuberculosis
for
instance
where
the
would
live
the
span
of
life
of
the
rich
is
greater
than
that
of
the
poor
the
long
list
of
diseases
from
is
mainly
from
the
poor
age
affects
disease
increasing
the
hazard
of
death
the
food
supply
seriously
affects
health
ignorance
is
a
prolific
cause
of
disease
or
to
speak
more
correctly
the
lack
of
education
and
knowledge
prevents
men
from
living
so
that
sickness
will
not
overtake
them
or
so
that
they
can
recover
when
they
are
attacked
by
disease
the
strength
or
weakness
of
the
nervous
system
is
a
material
factor
the
times
of
life
too
when
the
ravages
of
disease
are
greatest
are
as
distinct
as
those
of
crime
and
barring
the
fact
that
the
few
who
are
left
at
seventy
rapidly
drop
away
the
time
of
the
greatest
disasters
would
rather
closely
correspond
with
that
of
crime
tuberculosis
and
insanity
for
instance
take
their
greatest
toll
in
the
period
of
adolescence
between
fifteen
and
years
just
as
crime
does
and
the
percentage
of
both
begins
falling
off
rapidly
after
thirty
accidents
can
be
as
surely
classified
and
many
of
them
in
the
same
way
the
poor
naturally
have
more
accidents
than
the
rich
the
ignorant
more
than
the
educated
the
more
than
the
accidents
are
directly
affected
by
climatic
conditions
they
are
affected
by
human
temperaments
by
the
strength
and
weakness
of
the
nervous
system
by
the
environment
by
heredity
and
by
all
the
manifold
stimuli
that
act
on
the
human
machine
legislatures
have
long
since
recognized
that
crime
does
not
really
stand
as
a
separate
and
isolated
phenomenon
in
human
life
they
have
long
since
passed
laws
to
safeguard
the
community
against
loss
by
accident
and
disease
a
lengthening
list
of
statutes
can
be
found
in
our
code
regulating
dangerous
machinery
the
operation
of
railroads
the
running
of
automobiles
the
construction
of
buildings
the
isolation
of
the
tubercular
and
those
suffering
from
other
contagious
diseases
the
amount
of
for
each
person
in
tenement
and
the
use
of
and
all
of
man
conduct
and
activity
for
the
prevention
of
accidents
and
disease
quite
apart
from
the
question
of
the
wisdom
or
the
foolishness
of
all
this
line
of
legislative
activity
over
which
there
will
always
be
serious
discussion
it
is
evident
that
criminal
conduct
even
now
occupies
no
unique
or
isolated
place
in
law
or
human
conduct
all
unconsciously
the
world
is
coming
to
look
on
all
sorts
of
conduct
either
as
social
or
and
this
regardless
of
what
has
already
been
classified
as
criminal
a
few
years
since
science
was
absorbed
in
the
study
of
man
racial
origin
and
development
today
biology
and
allied
sciences
are
devoted
to
unraveling
the
complex
causes
responsible
for
individual
development
it
is
fair
to
presume
that
this
new
effort
of
science
may
be
able
in
time
to
solve
the
problem
of
crime
and
that
it
may
do
for
the
conduct
and
mental
aberrations
of
man
what
it
has
already
done
for
his
physical
diseases
xxxiv
luck
and
chance
accident
and
luck
may
seem
to
have
no
place
in
a
world
of
law
and
yet
the
fate
of
lives
rests
almost
entirely
on
what
can
be
better
classified
under
this
head
than
any
other
this
is
a
pluralistic
universe
the
world
is
made
up
of
an
infinite
number
of
independent
machines
each
having
its
own
existence
and
controlled
by
the
laws
of
its
own
being
in
going
its
several
ways
and
living
its
own
life
inevitably
it
often
clashes
with
others
and
is
seriously
affected
by
them
the
fox
and
the
rabbit
both
roam
the
woods
apparently
at
will
at
least
independently
of
each
other
by
an
infinite
number
of
circumstances
at
a
particular
time
and
place
their
paths
cross
and
the
fox
devours
the
rabbit
had
they
not
met
at
the
time
and
place
the
fate
of
the
rabbit
would
not
have
been
the
same
the
fox
would
have
traveled
farther
and
eaten
another
rabbit
or
some
other
animal
in
its
stead
an
engine
is
running
on
a
railroad
track
it
makes
the
trip
day
after
day
without
accident
or
disaster
an
automobile
is
one
of
a
million
built
in
a
far
off
city
its
mechanism
is
marvelous
and
each
part
is
dependent
on
the
rest
for
its
normal
functioning
some
vital
piece
of
the
machine
contains
a
flaw
how
it
chanced
to
be
imperfect
is
another
story
involving
endless
speculation
an
inherent
natural
defect
in
the
ore
or
a
tired
workman
anywhere
from
the
original
smelting
place
to
the
last
hand
that
touched
it
may
have
been
the
cause
or
the
reason
may
be
still
more
impossible
to
discover
the
machine
is
purchased
and
does
its
work
perfectly
for
months
it
is
driven
thousands
of
miles
without
any
mishap
it
is
propelled
along
the
highway
and
reaches
the
railroad
track
over
which
the
engine
runs
it
is
filled
with
happy
people
enjoying
a
vacation
the
automobile
and
the
engine
reach
the
crossing
at
almost
the
same
time
the
automobile
driver
sees
the
engine
and
applies
the
brakes
for
the
first
time
since
it
left
the
shop
the
machinery
does
not
work
the
car
forges
ahead
and
reaches
the
tracks
just
in
time
to
be
struck
by
the
engine
the
merry
party
meets
disaster
no
power
could
foresee
the
catastrophe
nor
provide
against
the
death
that
must
result
inevitably
comes
the
clash
of
independent
machines
each
human
being
is
a
separate
machine
along
the
road
of
life
he
meets
countless
others
like
himself
some
chance
meetings
are
fortunate
and
help
the
journey
some
other
chance
meeting
with
a
human
machine
a
mechanical
device
an
infinitesimal
microbe
that
happened
to
be
at
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
brings
disaster
or
death
this
is
luck
or
chance
or
fate
and
this
really
hovers
over
every
life
controlling
its
course
and
destiny
and
deciding
when
the
puppet
shall
be
laid
away
luck
and
chance
are
the
chief
of
all
factors
that
really
affect
man
from
birth
to
death
the
human
machine
is
called
on
to
make
endless
adjustments
a
child
is
born
and
starts
down
the
road
of
life
he
starts
blindly
and
for
the
most
part
travels
the
whole
way
in
the
mists
and
clouds
on
his
pathway
he
meets
an
infinite
number
of
other
pilgrims
going
blindly
like
himself
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
all
about
him
and
in
front
of
him
are
snares
and
pitfalls
his
brain
and
nervous
system
are
filled
with
emotions
and
desires
which
lure
him
here
and
there
temptations
are
beckoning
and
passions
urging
him
he
has
no
guide
to
show
the
way
and
no
compass
to
direct
his
course
he
knows
that
the
journey
will
bring
him
to
disaster
in
the
end
he
does
not
know
the
time
or
the
nature
of
the
last
catastrophe
he
shall
meet
every
step
is
taken
in
doubt
and
pain
and
fear
his
friends
and
companions
through
accident
or
disease
drop
around
him
day
by
day
he
can
not
go
back
or
halt
or
wait
he
must
go
forward
to
the
bitter
end
the
whole
journey
of
life
is
largely
a
question
of
luck
let
anyone
ask
himself
the
question
how
often
he
has
escaped
disaster
or
how
often
death
has
just
passed
him
by
how
often
has
he
done
some
act
that
would
have
led
to
degradation
had
it
been
known
how
many
escapes
has
he
met
how
many
accidents
has
he
had
which
luckily
were
slight
but
which
easily
might
have
caused
his
destruction
chance
is
the
great
element
in
life
two
men
invest
money
one
gains
a
fortune
the
other
loses
all
two
men
are
riding
in
a
machine
and
it
goes
over
a
cliff
one
is
killed
the
other
escapes
the
deadly
germ
is
taken
by
one
it
passes
the
other
by
or
it
is
taken
by
one
when
his
health
will
make
him
immune
by
another
at
the
time
that
it
will
destroy
his
life
how
many
temptations
to
violate
the
law
has
one
just
missed
by
a
lucky
accident
how
many
times
has
a
previous
experience
education
or
a
friend
at
the
right
time
saved
him
from
destruction
the
imperfect
man
travels
this
road
he
is
poor
and
friendless
his
life
is
a
long
series
of
accidents
great
and
small
the
first
accident
that
weakens
his
structure
makes
the
second
more
certain
and
so
on
in
increasing
ratio
until
the
end
good
luck
crowds
around
one
life
while
ill
luck
and
disaster
follow
another
footsteps
wherever
he
goes
with
the
persistency
of
his
shadow
in
all
the
infinite
number
of
chances
one
false
step
may
be
enough
to
bring
final
disaster
all
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
step
every
pilgrim
makes
innumerable
false
steps
often
luck
alone
saves
the
situation
often
luck
alone
compasses
the
destruction
insurance
companies
know
just
when
accidents
will
befall
the
insured
if
a
man
lives
long
enough
he
will
die
from
a
mischance
in
a
thousand
men
a
certain
number
will
meet
accident
in
a
given
time
it
is
just
the
same
whether
the
insurance
is
written
to
be
payable
when
a
leg
is
cut
off
by
a
train
or
when
money
is
embezzled
from
an
employer
in
either
event
the
time
can
be
figured
out
and
inevitably
it
will
come
if
the
time
is
long
enough
neither
is
it
necessary
that
the
bad
luck
shall
be
great
at
the
first
misfortune
it
may
be
but
the
loss
of
a
few
dollars
which
another
could
easily
stand
it
may
be
only
a
few
days
of
sickness
which
would
be
of
no
consequence
to
someone
else
it
may
be
the
death
of
a
father
or
an
uncle
while
the
same
sort
of
tragedy
might
be
the
source
of
wealth
it
may
be
some
other
person
hard
luck
which
takes
him
from
school
and
leaves
him
to
follow
a
life
of
hard
and
constant
toil
it
may
be
that
he
had
the
bad
luck
not
to
marry
the
person
of
his
choice
or
it
may
be
that
he
had
the
bad
luck
to
marry
her
it
may
be
because
he
had
no
children
it
may
be
because
he
had
too
many
it
may
well
be
that
he
has
been
saved
from
prison
by
dying
early
of
tuberculosis
he
may
have
been
saved
from
a
railroad
wreck
by
going
to
jail
infinite
are
the
tricks
of

infinite
are
the
combinations

that
may
come
from

cards
in
a
single
deck

is
the
perfect

that
should
be

punish
vengefully
his
let
one
look
honestly
into
his
own
life
and
pick
out
the
important
things
that
lead
to
fortune
or
disaster
from
birth
onward
and
say
how
many
are
the
results
of
circumstances
over
which
he
had
no
control
where
is
the
human
being
in
the
presence
of
a
dead
child
or
a
dead
parent
or
a
dead
friend

in
the
presence
of
a
terrible
trouble
that
has
not
sat
down
in
sorrow
and
despair
and
again
and
again
lived
over
every
circumstance
that
led
to

why
he
did
not
turn
this
way
instead
of
that
way
why
did
he
not
stop
here
or
go
there
why
did

why
did

not

that
why
did
he
not
take
this
short
step
why
did
he
not
think
of
this
or
think
of
that
if
only
any
one
of
almost
an
infinite
number
of
things
had
been
done
or
left
undone
the
dead
would
be
alive
or
the
disaster
would
not
have
befallen
every
man
who
is
honest
with
himself
knows
that
he
has
been
a
creature
of
conditions
and
chance
or
at
least
what
is
chance
as
far
as
a
man
can
see
and
what
was
clearly
chance
to
him
he
knows
that
if
he
has
met
success
he
has
only
been
more
in
luck
than
the
rest
if
he
has
intelligence
and
human
sympathy
he
feels
only
pity
for
the
suffering
he
would
never
punish
in
vengeance
or
hatred
he
knows
that
all
do
the
best
they
can
with
what
they
have
enumerating
some
of
the
many
causes
of
crime
ought
to
be
an
unnecessary

give
the

the

shows
that

as
surely
as

every

of

not

upon
the
fortune
of
the

that
surrounds
every

it
must
be
plain
that

lasts
only
as
long
as
it
makes

that
it
consists
only
of
adjustments
that
ordinarily
strong

and

will
serve

that
generally
a

and

by

or
both
whatever
catastrophe
overtakes
it

the

depend
not
upon

of

but
upon
the
character
of
the
machine
that
starts
on
the

and
the
road
it
travels
the

can
not
in

or
justice
be
divided
into

or
they
are
all
natural
they
are

all
inevitable
each
is
the
inevitable
destruction
of
a
machine
which
could
stand
so
much
but
which
could
stand
no
more
and
in
each
in
spite
of
both
heredity
and
the
general
environment
the
constant
meeting
with
other
machines
due
to
pure
luck
and

is
a
great
factor

not
the

factor
that

xxxv
pardons
and
paroles
it
has
always
been
the
province
of
the
chief
executive
of
a
state
or
nation
to
grant
pardons
or
clemency
to
those
who
are
confined
in
prison
this
is
largely
to
correct
the
mistakes
of
courts
and
juries
and
is
often
indulged
in
by
presidents
and
governors
at
christmas
time
experience
shows
that
during
the
trial
of
a
case
especially
one
that
causes
public
notice
and
general
discussion
injustice
is
frequently
done
often
the
defendant
is
convicted
when
he
should
have
been
acquitted
and
still
more
frequently
punishments
are
excessive
and
cruel
almost
never
is
any
serious
inquiry
made
as
to
the
heredity
and
environment
of
the
accused
probably
trial
by
jury
has
served
to
save
many
defendants
where
the
judge
would
have
convicted
and
has
still
more
often
tempered
and
modified
penalties
still
juries
are
by
no
means
free
from
the
mob
psychology
that
surrounds
and
affects
most
important
and
cases
jurors
are
generally
none
too
intelligent
and
not
very
ready
to
stand
against
public
opinion
most
men
agree
with
the
crowd
the
prevailing
religious
opinion
and
the
dominant
political
and
social
ideas
are
accepted
and
believed
by
the
ordinary
citizen
social
and
business
considerations
cause
most
men
to
go
with
the
crowd
and
in
any
case
of
importance
it
is
easy
for
a
jury
to
tell
the
feeling
of
the
populace
if
the
case
has
attracted
much
attention
the
juror
knows
the
prevailing
ideas
as
to
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
when
he
takes
his
seat
in
the
box
he
almost
always
shares
that
feeling
if
the
case
is
not
one
he
has
heard
of
or
discussed
he
can
easily
tell
by
the
actions
and
surroundings
of
the
court
room
how
public
feeling
lies
all
lawyers
know
how
readily
men
feel
the
sentiment
of
a
court
room
and
how
much
easier
is
the
task
when
the
sentiment
is
their
way
juries
are
also
apt
to
have
an
undue
regard
for
the
opinion
of
the
judge
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
is
their
province
to
pass
upon
the
facts
they
are
very
watchful
of
all
the
judge
says
and
does
and
are
prone
to
decide
a
case
as
they
believe
the
judge
wishes
it
to
be
decided
even
when
the
judge
is
not
permitted
to
express
any
opinions
on
the
facts
involved
it
is
difficult
for
him
to
hide
his
real
feelings
and
when
his
desire
is
strong
for
either
side
it
is
easy
to
make
his
opinions
known
a
jury
is
more
apt
to
be
unbiased
and
independent
than
a
court
but
they
very
seldom
stand
up
against
strong
public
clamor
judges
naturally
believe
the
defendant
is
guilty
they
feel
that
the
fact
that
an
indictment
has
been
found
is
a
strong
presumption
against
the
accused
the
judge
regards
himself
as
a
part
of
the
administration
of
justice
and
feels
that
it
is
a
part
of
his
duty
to
see
that
no
guilty
man
escapes
generally
in
the
administration
of
the
court
he
is
very
closely
connected
with
the
state
attorney
and
naturally
believes
that
the
attorney
would
not
have
procured
an
indictment
much
less
pushed
a
trial
unless
the
defendant
was
guilty
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
court
at
the
time
of
the
trial
calls
for
a
harsher
and
more
drastic
dealing
with
a
defendant
than
would
naturally
prevail
after
the
feeling
has
passed
away
for
this
reason
the
pardoning
power
is
given
to
the
chief
executive
to
correct
errors
or
undue
harshness
after
the
legal
proceedings
have
been
finished
often
after
months
or
years
the
persons
or
family
who
have
suffered
at
the
hands
of
the
defendant
feel
like
reversing
their
judgment
or
extending
charity
and
it
is
not
unusual
that
the
prosecutor
and
judge
who
conducted
the
case
ask
for
leniency
and
a
mitigation
of
the
sentence
is
imposed
so
often
is
an
appeal
made
and
so
frequently
is
it
felt
just
to
grant
clemency
that
this
part
of
the
duty
of
the
chief
executive
has
grown
to
be
very
burdensome
and
really
impossible
for
him
thoroughly
to
perform
the
policy
of
the
law
is
further
to
give
a
prisoner
some
consideration
and
in
cases
of
good
behavior
and
mitigating
circumstances
to
release
him
before
the
expiration
of
his
time
in
most
states
this
has
called
for
the
creating
of
a
board
of
pardons
and
parole
the
statutes
fixing
penalties
for
certain
offenses
provide
for
a
reduction
of
a
certain
number
of
weeks
or
months
each
year
but
as
a
rule
courts
take
this
provision
into
consideration
and
figure
out
the
net
time
they
wish
to
give
the
defendant
so
that
there
is
no
clemency
except
through
pardon
or
parole
in
most
states
the
duties
of
the
board
are
very
grave
and
its
business
large
with
this
has
generally
gone
a
law
providing
for
the
release
of
prisoners
on
parole
before
their
sentences
are
finished
in
these
cases
the
prisoner
is
paroled
to
someone
who
promises
the
board
to
employ
him
and
a
monthly
report
is
to
be
made
of
his
conduct
for
a
stated
length
of
time
he
is
then
given
conditional
freedom
subject
to
the
revocation
of
the
parole
by
the
board
on
the
violation
of
its
terms
the
administration
of
this
power
has
made
the
parole
board
one
of
the
most
important
if
not
the
most
important
of
any
branch
of
the
state
government
the
lives
and
of
thousands
of
prisoners
are
absolutely
dependent
on
this
board
even
more
important
are
the
happiness
and
of
the
families
of
the
inmates
of
the
prison
the
power
and
responsibilities
of
this
board
are
so
great
that
only
men
of
the
best
judgment
and
of
humane
and
just
tendencies
should
be
trusted
with
the
task
it
also
calls
for
great
courage
such
as
few
men
on
boards
possess
the
public
generally
clamors
for
vengeance
and
unfairly
and
unjustly
criticises
the
board
especially
when
a
released
man
violates
his
parole
or
commits
another
crime
this
frequently
happens
perhaps
on
an
average
ten
per
cent
of
those
paroled
are
sent
back
to
prison
before
their
term
expires
all
this
makes
it
hard
for
the
board
to
perform
its
duties
and
makes
the
members
of
the
board
timid
and
doubtful
of
the
result
often
causing
them
to
deny
paroles
in
many
cases
where
they
should
be
given
a
great
deal
of
criticism
has
been
made
of
the
parole
system
public
officials
and
that
part
of
the
crowd
that
is
clamorous
for
vengeance
are
always
ready
to
assail
its
activities
unfairly
and
unduly
most
professional
criminals
are
against
the
parole
board
speaking
of
the
state
of
illinois
i
am
sure
that
the
parole
law
instead
of
shortening
the
time
of
imprisonment
has
lengthened
the
terms
all
lawyers
in
any
way
competent
to
handle
the
defense
of
a
criminal
case
would
in
the
event
of
conviction
almost
always
get
a
shorter
term
for
their
clients
from
a
jury
or
from
the
court
or
even
from
the
prosecutor
than
from
the
parole
board
i
feel
strongly
that
the
board
is
too
timid
and
unwilling
to
grant
paroles
still
in
spite
of
this
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
parole
law
is
a
step
in
the
right
direction
and
it
should
be
upheld
by
all
who
believe
offenders
should
have
a
better
chance
if
human
nature
in
the
administration
of
law
could
be
relied
on
if
there
were
some
method
of
getting
men
of
courage
and
capacity
with
plenty
of
competent
aid
and
assistance
to
take
charge
of
paroles
and
prisons
then
the
ideal
sentence
should
be
one
that
fixed
no
time
whatever
it
should
simply
leave
a
prisoner
for
study
and
observation
until
it
was
thought
wise
and
safe
to
release
him
from
restraint
this
like
all
the
rest
could
not
be
done
with
the
present
public
attitude
toward
criminals
so
long
as
men
subscribe
to
the
prevailing
idea
of
crime
and
punishment
no
officials
could
stand
up
against
public
opinion
in
the
carrying
out
of
a
new
and
radical
theory
and
even
if
such
a
board
should
be
established
the
law
under
which
it
acted
would
soon
be
repealed
or
the
members
of
the
board
forced
to
resign
and
a
new
one
would
take
its
place
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
effect
of
parole
boards
has
been
to
lengthen
sentences
and
in
spite
of
my
personal
belief
that
they
should
be
materially
shortened
i
am
confident
that
the
parole
system
should
be
maintained
with
the
hope
of
improvement
and
the
chance
of
gradually
educating
the
public
until
sentences
can
be
naturally
shortened
and
the
care
and
control
of
prisoners
be
placed
on
a
scientific
and
humane
basis
a
board
of
pardons
and
paroles
should
be
made
up
of
men
who
are
really
interested
in
their
work
they
should
carefully
keep
up
with
the
literature
on
crime
and
punishment
they
should
be
scientists
in
all
matters
touching
their
work
and
they
should
be
men
of
humane
feelings
it
is
too
much
to
expect
that
all
of
this
can
be
found
in
a
board
for
a
long
time
to
come
but
with
good
sense
and
the
right
attitude
of
mind
the
board
could
employ
the
skill
that
it
does
not
now
have
every
prisoner
should
be
the
subject
of
attention
not
of
spying
but
of
friendly
interest
that
would
inspire
confidence
and
trust
such
an
interest
as
a
wise
doctor
has
in
a
patient
this
attention
would
in
most
cases
gain
the
confidence
of
the
prisoner
and
make
it
possible
to
find
out
how
far
he
could
be
trusted
at
the
same
time
showing
the
treatment
and
environment
he
needed
for
future
development
where
this
confidence
could
not
be
had
safety
would
probably
require
a
longer
term
most
men
respond
to
kind
treatment
the
criminal
has
so
long
looked
on
the
world
as
his
enemy
especially
the
official
world
that
he
hesitates
to
trust
anyone
still
the
really
sympathetic
and
kindly
man
who
is
honestly
trying
to
help
him
will
sooner
or
later
get
his
confidence
and
coöperation
every
prisoner
should
understand
that
all
of
those
around
him
are
anxious
to
educate
him
so
as
to
fit
him
for
society
and
to
put
him
in
an
environment
where
he
can
live
even
then
there
would
be
mistakes
and
a
portion
of
the
prisoners
would
be
so
defective
or
imperfect
that
they
never
could
be
released
but
under
proper
treatment
many
would
be
restored
to
association
with
their
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
it
will
be
safe
to
make
sentences
entirely
indeterminate
boards
can
not
be
trusted
to
give
such
time
and
work
and
judgment
to
their
task
as
will
prevent
cases
of
great
injustice
until
such
time
shall
come
either
the
statutes
must
fix
an
unbending
and
arbitrary
time
which
takes
no
account
of
individual
cases
or
it
must
be
left
with
the
court
or
jury
clearly
the
jury
should
fix
the
maximum
leaving
the
members
of
the
board
to
reduce
the
penalty
if
they
deem
it
wise
most
men
are
forgotten
when
they
go
to
prison
especially
if
they
have
no
active
friends
on
the
outside
no
board
can
fully
keep
in
mind
all
the
inmates
of
a
large
prison
it
may
be
that
by
some
system
their
attention
is
automatically
called
to
the
man
at
certain
times
but
this
matters
very
little
someone
should
know
he
is
there
and
why
and
who
he
is
he
should
not
be
an
abstract
but
a
concrete
man
for
these
reasons
a
limit
should
always
be
set
on
a
punishment
and
the
limit
should
not
be
too
long
the
idea
of
a
tribunal
perhaps
including
the
judge
who
passed
sentence
having
the
power
and
the
duty
imposed
upon
him
to
review
sentences
and
reduce
them
if
it
seemed
best
from
time
to
time
might
have
a
good
effect
the
feelings
of
most
men
in
reference
to
the
degree
of
punishment
change
as
time
goes
by
always
with
the
punishment
is
a
strong
feeling
of
both
hate
and
fear
it
is
not
possible
really
to
punish
that
is
to
inflict
suffering
without
hate
or
fear
the
most
necessary
thing
in
preparing
soldiers
to
fight
is
to
teach
them
to
hate
and
fear
the
enemy
in
the
trial
of
a
case
these
feelings
are
fresh
in
the
minds
of
the
prosecutor
and
the
judge
when
the
case
is
finished
and
they
necessarily
act
more
or
less
under
the
dominance
of
their
passions
in
time
these
feelings
fade
and
a
saner
and
kindlier
judgment
takes
the
place
of
the
first
feelings
that
possessed
the
mind
with
the
parole
system
is
going
on
a
movement
for
probation
this
provides
that
the
convicted
man
need
not
be
sent
to
prison
but
may
be
released
on
certain
terms
sometimes
requiring
that
money
taken
shall
be
refunded
after
that
he
shall
be
placed
under
the
supervision
of
some
friend
or
agent
who
will
report
from
time
to
time
to
probation
officers
or
to
the
court
probation
is
generally
granted
to
young
prisoners
and
first
offenders
but
usually
not
permitted
in
cases
that
the
law
classifies
as
the
most
serious
parole
and
probation
are
much
the
same
in
theory
in
both
these
cases
the
clemency
should
depend
much
more
upon
the
man
than
on
the
crime
it
does
not
follow
that
a
very
serious
crime
shows
a
poorer
moral
fibre
than
a
lesser
one
it
may
well
be
that
the
seemingly
slight
transgressions
like
stealing
small
amounts
picking
pockets
and
the
like
show
a
really
weaker
nature
than
goes
with
a
more
heroic
crime
there
is
no
such
liability
to
repeat
in
homicide
as
there
is
in
forgery
or
swindling
the
seriousness
of
a
homicide
is
likely
to
make
it
impossible
that
the
same
man
shall
ever
kill
again
many
such
men
would
be
perfectly
safe
on
probation
or
parole
but
the
smaller
things
that
are
easily
concealed
and
come
from
an
effort
of
the
condemned
to
live
either
without
work
or
in
a
better
way
than
his
ability
or
training
permits
him
to
do
in
the
hard
and
unfair
conditions
that
society
imposes
are
often
much
harder
to
overcome
at
any
rate
the
main
question
should
be
in
regard
to
the
man
and
not
the
crime
in
cases
of
parole
or
probation
society
should
do
what
it
can
to
help
the
man
make
good
generally
employment
is
necessary
and
a
different
and
easier
environment
often
indispensable
if
organized
society
would
only
take
the
pains
to
make
an
easier
environment
for
all
the
less
favored
the
problem
would
be
fairly
simple
and
most
of
the
misery
that
comes
from
crime
and
prison
would
gradually
disappear
xxxvi
remedies
students
of
crime
and
punishment
have
never
differed
seriously
in
their
conclusions
all
investigations
have
arrived
at
the
result
that
crime
is
due
to
causes
that
man
is
either
not
morally
responsible
or
responsible
only
to
a
slight
degree
all
have
doubted
the
efficacy
of
punishment
and
practically
no
one
has
accepted
the
common
ideas
that
prevail
as
to
crime
its
nature
its
treatment
and
the
proper
and
efficient
way
of
protecting
society
from
the
criminal
the
real
question
of
importance
is
what
shall
be
done
can
crime
be
cured
if
not
can
it
be
wiped
out
and
how
what
rights
have
the
public
what
rights
has
the
criminal
what
obligations
does
the
public
owe
the
criminal
what
duties
does
each
citizen
owe
society
it
must
be
confessed
that
all
these
questions
are
more
easily
asked
than
answered
perhaps
none
of
them
can
be
satisfactorily
answered
it
is
a
common
obsession
that
every
evil
must
have
a
remedy
that
if
it
can
not
be
cured
today
it
can
be
tomorrow
that
man
is
a
creature
of
infinite
possibilities
and
all
that
is
needed
is
time
and
patience
given
these
a
perfect
world
will
eventuate
i
am
convinced
that
man
is
not
a
creature
of
infinite
possibilities
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
he
has
not
run
his
race
and
reached
if
not
passed
the
zenith
of
his
power
i
have
no
idea
that
every
evil
can
be
cured
that
all
trouble
can
be
banished
that
every
maladjustment
can
be
corrected
or
that
the
millennium
can
be
reached
now
and
here
or
any
time
or
anywhere
i
am
not
even
convinced
that
the
race
can
substantially
improve
perhaps
here
and
there
society
can
be
made
to
run
a
little
more
smoothly
perhaps
some
of
the
chief
frictions
incident
to
life
may
be
avoided
perhaps
we
can
develop
a
little
higher
social
order
perhaps
we
may
get
rid
of
some
of
the
cruelty
incident
to
social
organization
but
how
to
start
with
it
seems
to
me
to
be
clear
that
there
is
really
no
such
thing
as
crime
as
the
word
is
generally
understood
every
activity
of
man
should
come
under
the
head
of
behavior
in
studying
crime
we
are
merely
investigating
a
certain
kind
of
human
behavior
man
acts
in
response
to
outside
stimuli
how
he
acts
depends
on
the
nature
strength
and
inherent
character
of
the
machine
and
the
habits
customs
inhibitions
and
experiences
that
environment
gives
him
man
is
in
no
sense
the
maker
of
himself
and
has
no
more
power
than
any
other
machine
to
escape
the
law
of
cause
and
effect
he
does
as
he
must
therefore
there
is
no
such
thing
as
moral
responsibility
in
the
sense
in
which
this
expression
is
ordinarily
used
punishment
as
something
inflicted
for
the
purpose
of
giving
pain
is
cruelty
and
vengeance
and
nothing
else
whatever
should
be
done
to
the
criminal
if
we
have
humanity
and
imagination
we
must
feel
sympathy
for
him
and
consider
his
best
good
along
with
that
of
all
the
rest
of
the
members
of
the
society
whose
welfare
is
our
concern
while
punishment
can
not
be
defended
still
is
inherent
in
both
individuals
and
society
and
without
arguing
its
justification
no
one
can
imagine
a
society
that
will
not
assert
it
and
act
for
its
defense
this
will
be
true
regardless
of
whether
the
given
society
is
worth
preserving
or
not
inherent
in
all
life
and
organization
is
the
impulse
of
those
members
of
society
who
are
sufficiently
from
the
standpoint
of
the
time
and
place
will
not
be
tolerated
unduly
to
disturb
the
rest
these
in
certain
instances
will
be
destroyed
or
deprived
of
their
power
to
harm
if
society
has
a
right
attitude
toward
the
subject
if
it
has
imagination
and
sympathy
and
understanding
it
will
isolate
these
victims
not
in
anger
but
in
pity
solely
for
the
protection
of
the
whole
some
there
are
who
ask
what
difference
it
makes
whether
it
is
called
punishment
or
not
i
think
that
the
attitude
of
society
toward
the
criminal
makes
the
whole
difference
and
any
improvement
is
out
of
the
question
until
this
attitude
influences
and
controls
the
whole
treatment
of
the
question
of
crime
and
punishment
if
doctors
and
scientists
had
been
no
wiser
than
lawyers
judges
legislatures
and
the
public
the
world
would
still
be
punishing
imbeciles
the
insane
the
inferior
and
the
sick
and
treating
human
ailments
with
incantations
witchcraft
force
and
magic
we
should
still
be
driving
devils
out
of
the
sick
and
into
the
swine
assuming
then
that
man
is
governed
by
external
conditions
that
he
inevitably
reacts
to
certain
stimuli
that
he
is
affected
by
all
the
things
that
surround
him
that
his
every
act
and
manifestation
is
a
result
of
law
what
then
must
we
and
can
we
do
with
and
for
the
criminal
first
of
all
we
must
abandon
the
idea
of
working
his
moral
reformation
as
the
term
moral
reformation
is
popularly
understood
as
well
might
we
cure
the
physically
ill
in
that
way
man
works
according
to
his
structure
he
never
does
reform
and
can
not
reform
as
he
grows
older
his
structure
changes
and
from
increase
of
vitality
or
from
decrease
of
vitality
his
habits
too
may
change
he
may
likewise
learn
by
experience
and
through
the
comparing
and
recalling
of
experiences
and
their
consequences
may
build
up
rules
of
conduct
which
will
restrain
him
from
doing
certain
things
that
he
otherwise
would
do
anything
that
increases
his
knowledge
and
adds
to
his
experience
will
naturally
affect
his
habits
and
will
either
build
up
or
tear
down
inhibitions
or
do
both
as
the
case
may
be
if
he
has
intelligence
he
knows
he
is
always
the
same
man
that
he
has
not
reformed
nor
repented
he
may
regret
that
he
did
certain
things
but
he
knows
why
and
how
he
did
them
and
why
he
will
not
repeat
them
if
he
can
avoid
it
the
intrinsic
character
of
the
man
can
not
change
for
the
machine
is
the
same
and
will
always
be
the
same
except
that
it
may
run
faster
or
slower
with
the
passing
years
or
it
may
be
influenced
by
the
habits
gained
from
experience
and
life
we
must
learn
to
appraise
rightly
the
equipment
of
every
child
and
as
far
as
possible
of
every
adult
to
the
end
that
they
may
find
an
environment
where
they
can
live
it
must
never
be
forgotten
that
man
is
nothing
but
heredity
and
environment
and
that
the
heredity
can
not
be
changed
but
the
environment
may
be
in
the
past
and
present
the
world
has
sought
to
adjust
heredity
to
environment
the
problem
of
the
future
in
dealing
with
crime
will
be
to
adjust
environment
to
heredity
to
a
large
extent
this
can
be
done
in
a
wholesale
way
any
improved
social
arrangement
that
will
make
it
easier
for
the
common
man
to
live
will
necessarily
save
a
large
number
from
crime
perhaps
if
the
social
improvement
should
be
great
enough
it
would
prevent
the
vast
majority
of
criminal
acts
life
should
be
made
easier
for
the
great
mass
from
which
the
criminal
is
ever
coming
as
far
as
experience
and
logic
can
prove
anything
it
is
certain
that
every
improvement
in
environment
will
lessen
crime
codes
of
law
should
be
shortened
and
rendered
simpler
it
should
not
be
expected
that
criminal
codes
will
cover
all
human
and
social
life
the
old
method
of
appealing
to
brute
force
and
fear
should
gradually
give
place
to
teaching
and
persuading
and
fitting
men
for
life
all
prisons
should
be
in
the
hands
of
experts
physicians
criminologists
biologists
and
above
all
the
humane
every
prisoner
should
be
made
to
feel
that
the
state
is
interested
in
his
good
as
well
as
the
good
of
the
society
from
which
he
came
sentences
should
be
indeterminate
but
the
indeterminate
sentence
of
today
is
often
a
menace
to
freedom
and
a
means
of
great
cruelty
and
wrong
the
indeterminate
sentence
can
only
be
of
value
in
a
prison
where
each
man
is
under
competent
observation
as
if
he
were
ill
in
a
hospital
and
this
should
be
supplemented
with
an
honest
intelligent
parole
commission
fully
equipped
for
thorough
work
until
that
time
comes
the
maximum
penalty
should
be
fixed
by
the
jury
the
parole
board
retaining
the
power
to
reduce
the
punishment
or
parole
no
two
crimes
are
alike
no
two
offenders
are
alike
those
who
have
no
friends
on
the
outside
are
forgotten
and
neglected
after
the
prison
doors
have
been
closed
upon
them
some
men
now
are
confined
much
too
long
others
not
long
enough
no
doubt
owing
to
the
imperfections
of
man
this
will
always
be
the
case
at
present
no
penal
institutions
have
the
equipment
or
management
to
provide
against
such
shortcomings
they
never
can
have
it
while
men
believe
punishment
is
vengeance
when
the
public
is
ready
to
provide
for
the
protection
of
society
and
still
to
recognize
and
heed
the
impulses
of
humanity
and
mercy
it
will
abolish
all
fixed
terms
as
well
might
it
send
a
patient
to
a
hospital
for
a
fixed
time
and
then
discharge
him
regardless
of
whether
he
is
cured
or
not
as
to
confine
a
convict
for
a
definite
predetermined
time
if
the
offense
is
one
of
a
serious
nature
that
endangers
the
public
the
prisoner
should
not
be
released
until
by
understanding
or
education
or
age
or
the
proper
form
of
treatment
it
is
fairly
evident
that
he
will
not
offend
again
when
the
time
comes
if
it
is
the
day
of
his
incarceration
he
should
be
released
the
smallest
reflection
ought
to
teach
that
for
many
crimes
especially
for
many
property
crimes
it
is
hopeless
to
release
a
prisoner
in
an
environment
where
he
can
not
survive
an
environment
adjusted
to
his
heredity
must
be
found
by
the
state
all
indignities
should
be
taken
away
from
prison
life
instead
the
prisoner
should
be
taught
that
his
act
was
the
necessary
result
of
cause
and
effect
and
that
given
his
heredity
and
environment
he
could
have
done
no
other
way
he
should
by
teaching
and
experience
be
shown
where
he
made
his
mistakes
and
he
should
be
given
an
environment
where
he
can
live
consistently
with
the
good
of
those
around
him
various
reforms
have
been
urged
in
the
treatment
of
criminals
and
in
criminal
procedure
in
the
courts
most
of
these
impress
me
as
possessing
no
fundamental
value
it
is
often
said
that
the
accused
should
be
given
an
immediate
trial
that
this
and
subsequent
proceedings
should
not
be
hindered
by
delay
that
the
uncertainties
of
punishment
furnish
the
criminal
with
the
hope
of
escape
and
therefore
do
not
give
the
community
the
benefit
of
the
terror
that
comes
with
the
certainty
of
punishment
that
could
prevent
crime
i
can
see
no
basis
in
logic
or
experience
for
this
suggestion
it
is
based
on
the
theory
that
punishment
is
not
only
a
deterrent
to
crime
but
the
main
deterrent
it
comes
from
the
idea
that
the
criminal
is
distinct
from
the
rest
of
mankind
that
vengeance
should
be
sure
and
speedy
and
that
then
crime
would
be
prevented
if
this
were
true
and
the
only
consideration
to
prevent
crime
then
the
old
torture
chamber
and
the
ancient
prison
with
all
its
hopelessness
and
horror
should
be
restored
logic
humanity
and
experience
would
protest
against
this
if
there
is
to
be
any
permanent
improvement
in
man
and
any
better
social
order
it
must
come
mainly
from
the
education
and
humanizing
of
man
i
am
quite
certain
that
the
more
the
question
of
crime
and
its
treatment
is
studied
the
less
faith
men
have
in
punishment
england
and
continental
europe
are
often
pointed
to
as
examples
of
sure
and
speedy
justice
the
fact
that
there
are
more
convictions
and
fewer
acquittals
in
england
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
trials
does
not
prove
that
the
english
system
is
better
than
ours
it
may
and
probably
does
mean
that
ours
is
better
here
the
accused
has
more
chance
there
the
expense
the
formality
the
power
of
the
court
all
conspire
to
destroy
every
opportunity
of
escape
regardless
of
innocence
or
guilt
even
the
fact
that
there
are
fewer
crimes
committed
in
england
does
not
prove
that
the
system
is
best
or
that
it
prevents
crime
an
old
country
with
its
life
of
caste
lacks
the
freedom
and
equality
that
naturally
produce
defiance
of
rules
and
customs
and
lead
to
breaches
of
the
law
other
things
being
equal
a
greater
degree
of
freedom
leads
to
more
violations
of
rules
and
greater
resisting
power
among
the
poor
than
a
lesser
degree
of
freedom
it
does
not
necessarily
follow
that
the
country
is
best
where
the
people
are
the
most
obedient
complete
obedience
leads
to
submission
to
aggression
and
to
despotism
doubtless
china
has
fewer
crimes
than
england
the
power
of
resistance
is
so
crushed
that
no
one
thinks
of
defying
a
master
resenting
an
injury
violating
a
rule
claiming
any
personal
rights
or
protesting
against
caste
age
or
privilege
always
there
are
certain
men
who
believe
that
all
reform
in
criminal
procedure
must
come
by
abolishing
juries
and
submitting
every
question
to
a
court
those
who
are
rich
and
strong
and
the
lawyers
who
advocate
their
interests
are
mainly
arrayed
on
this
side
the
poor
and
rebellious
with
those
who
naturally
or
otherwise
advocate
their
cause
stand
for
the
juries
as
against
the
courts
those
who
strive
to
be
fair
are
often
misled
from
a
lack
of
experience
and
little
judgment
of
human
nature
the
public
is
always
against
the
accused
the
press
is
against
him
the
machinery
of
the
law
is
against
him
the
dice
are
loaded
for
his
conviction
some
people
have
childish
faith
in
the
courts
but
judges
are
neither
infinitely
wise
nor
infinitely
good
they
come
from
the
ranks
of
lawyers
and
for
the
most
part
from
those
who
have
been
long
engaged
in
defending
property
rights
they
are
generally
conservative
they
are
not
independent
of
public
opinion
almost
invariably
they
reflect
public
opinion
which
means
the
public
opinion
of
the
community
in
which
they
live
few
of
them
have
much
knowledge
of
biology
of
psychology
of
sociology
or
even
of
history
one
curse
of
our
political
life
comes
from
the
fact
that
as
soon
as
a
man
has
secured
an
office
he
has
his
eye
on
another
and
his
whole
effort
is
to
please
the
people
that
is
the
people
who
express
themselves
the
most
easily
very
few
judges
rise
to
a
great
degree
of
independence
or
defy
popular
clamor
a
jury
is
less
bound
by
public
opinion
their
responsibility
is
divided
they
are
not
as
a
rule
seeking
office
while
swayed
by
the
crowd
they
are
still
more
independent
than
judges
and
with
them
the
common
man
the
accused
has
a
better
chance
no
doubt
judges
are
abler
better
educated
more
accustomed
to
weighing
evidence
and
able
to
arrive
at
a
more
logical
conclusion
than
most
juries
still
none
of
these
qualities
necessarily
leads
to
just
findings
questions
of
right
and
wrong
are
not
determined
by
strict
rules
of
logic
if
public
opinion
could
come
to
regard
the
criminal
as
it
does
the
insane
the
imbecile
or
the
ill
then
a
judicial
determination
would
be
the
best
but
as
long
as
crime
is
regarded
as
moral
delinquency
and
punishment
savors
of
vengeance
every
possible
safeguard
and
protection
must
be
thrown
around
the
accused
in
the
settling
of
opinions
and
the
passing
of
judgments
mob
psychology
is
and
really
in
the
last
analysis
every
human
question
comes
down
to
the
power
of
public
opinion
the
first
thing
necessary
to
lessen
crime
and
to
relieve
victims
from
the
cruelty
of
moral
judgments
is
a
change
of
public
opinion
as
to
human
responsibility
when
scientific
ideas
on
this
important
subject
shall
be
generally
accepted
all
things
that
are
possible
will
follow
from
it
some
headway
has
already
been
made
in
the
direction
of
considering
heredity
and
environment
theoretically
we
no
longer
hold
the
insane
responsible
and
some
allowance
is
made
for
children
and
the
obviously
defective
the
discouraging
thing
is
that
the
public
is
fickle
and
changeable
and
any
temporary
feeling
overwhelms
the
patient
efforts
of
years
in
the
present
mad
crusade
against
crime
consequent
upon
the
great
war
penalties
have
been
increased
new
crimes
created
and
paroles
and
pardons
have
been
made
almost
impossible
the
public
and
press
virtually
declare
that
even
insanity
should
not
save
the
life
of
one
who
slays
his
fellow
repeatedly
the
insane
are
hanged
without
a
chance
and
sentences
of
death
are
pronounced
where
before
a
term
of
years
or
life
imprisonment
would
have
been
the
penalty
for
the
offense
individual
men
and
collections
of
men
are
ruled
not
by
judgment
but
by
impulse
the
voice
of
conscience
and
mercy
is
always
very
weak
and
drowned
by
the
hoarse
cry
for
vengeance
as
long
as
men
collectively
impose
their
will
upon
the
individual
units
they
should
consider
that
this
imposition
calls
for
intelligence
kindliness
tolerance
and
a
large
degree
of
sympathy
and
understanding
in
considering
the
welfare
of
the
public
the
accused
his
family
and
his
friends
should
be
included
as
a
part
it
need
not
be
expected
that
all
maladjustments
can
ever
be
wiped
out
organization
with
its
close
relation
of
individual
units
implies
conflict
nevertheless
the
effort
should
be
to
remove
all
possible
inducement
for
the
violent
clashing
of
individuals
and
to
minimize
the
severity
of
such
conflicts
