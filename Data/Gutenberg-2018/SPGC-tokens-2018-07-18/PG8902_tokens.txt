chapter
day
begins
the
story
i
am
old
else
i
think
i
should
not
have
the
courage
to
tell
the
story
i
am
going
to
tell
all
those
concerned
in
it
about
whose
feelings
i
am
careful
are
gone
where
thank
god
there
are
no
secrets
if
they
know
what
i
am
doing
i
know
they
do
not
mind
if
they
were
alive
to
read
as
i
record
they
might
perhaps
now
and
again
look
a
little
paler
and
wish
the
leaf
turned
but
to
see
the
things
set
down
would
not
make
them
unhappy
they
do
not
love
secrecy
half
the
misery
in
the
world
comes
from
trying
to
look
instead
of
trying
to
be
what
one
is
not
i
would
that
not
god
only
but
all
good
men
and
women
might
see
me
through
and
through
they
would
not
be
pleased
with
everything
they
saw
but
then
neither
am
i
and
i
would
have
no
coals
of
fire
in
my
soul
pockets
but
my
very
nature
would
shudder
at
the
thought
of
letting
one
person
that
loved
a
secret
see
into
it
such
a
one
never
sees
things
as
they
are
would
not
indeed
see
what
was
there
but
something
shaped
and
coloured
after
his
own
likeness
no
one
who
loves
and
chooses
a
secret
can
be
of
the
pure
in
heart
that
shall
see
god
yet
how
shall
i
tell
even
who
i
am
which
of
us
is
other
than
a
secret
to
all
but
god
which
of
us
can
tell
with
poorest
approximation
what
he
or
she
is
not
to
touch
the
mystery
of
life
that
one
who
is
not
myself
has
made
me
able
to
say
how
little
can
any
of
us
tell
about
even
those
ancestors
whose
names
we
know
while
yet
the
nature
and
still
more
the
character
of
hundreds
of
them
have
shared
in
determining
what
means
every
time
one
of
us
utters
the
word
for
myself
i
remember
neither
father
nor
mother
nor
one
of
their
fathers
or
mothers
how
little
then
can
i
say
as
to
what
i
am
but
i
will
tell
as
much
as
most
of
my
readers
if
ever
i
have
any
will
care
to
know
i
come
of
a
long
of
the
name
of
whichcote
in
scotland
the
whichcotes
would
have
been
called
in
england
they
were
not
called
repeatedly
had
younger
sons
of
it
risen
to
rank
and
honour
and
in
several
generations
would
his
property
have
entitled
the
head
of
the
family
to
rank
as
a
squire
but
at
the
time
when
i
began
to
be
aware
of
existence
the
family
possessions
had
dwindled
to
one
large
farm
on
which
i
found
myself
naturally
while
some
of
the
family
had
risen
others
had
sunk
in
the
social
scale
and
of
the
latter
was
miss
martha
moon
far
more
to
my
life
than
can
appear
in
my
story
i
should
imagine
there
are
few
families
in
england
covering
a
larger
range
of
social
difference
than
ours
but
i
begin
to
think
the
chief
difficulty
in
writing
a
book
must
be
to
keep
out
what
does
not
belong
to
it
i
may
mention
however
my
conviction
that
i
owe
many
special
delights
to
the
gradual
development
of
my
race
in
certain
special
relations
to
the
natural
ways
of
the
world
that
i
was
myself
brought
up
in
such
relations
appears
not
enough
to
account
for
the
intensity
of
my
pleasure
in
things
belonging
to
simplest
life
in
everything
of
the
open
air
in
animals
of
all
kinds
in
the
economy
of
field
and
meadow
and
moor
i
can
no
more
understand
my
delight
in
the
sweet
breath
of
a
cow
than
i
can
explain
the
process
by
which
that
day
in
the
garden
but
i
must
not
forestall
and
will
say
rather
than
i
can
account
for
the
tears
which
now
i
am
an
old
woman
fill
my
eyes
just
as
they
used
when
i
was
a
child
at
sight
of
the
year
first
primrose
a
harebell
much
as
i
have
always
loved
harebells
never
moved
me
that
way
some
will
say
the
cause
whatever
it
be
lies
in
my
nature
not
in
my
ancestry
that
anyhow
it
must
have
come
first
to
some
one
and
why
not
to
me
i
answer
everything
lies
in
everyone
of
us
but
has
to
be
brought
to
the
surface
it
grows
a
little
in
one
more
in
that
one
child
more
in
that
child
child
and
so
on
and
on
with
curious
breaks
as
of
a
river
which
every
now
and
then
takes
to
an
underground
course
one
thing
i
am
sure
of
that
however
any
good
thing
came
i
did
not
make
it
i
can
only
be
glad
and
thankful
that
in
me
it
came
to
the
surface
to
tell
me
how
beautiful
must
he
be
who
thought
of
it
and
made
it
in
me
then
surely
one
is
nearer
if
not
to
god
himself
yet
to
the
things
god
loves
in
the
country
than
amid
ugly
houses
things
that
could
not
have
been
invented
by
god
though
he
made
the
man
that
made
them
it
is
not
the
fashionable
only
that
love
the
town
and
not
the
country
the
men
and
women
who
live
in
dirt
and
squalor
their
counterparts
in
this
and
worse
things
far
more
than
they
think
are
afraid
of
loneliness
and
hate
god
lovely
dark
chapter
ii
miss
martha
moon
let
me
look
back
and
see
what
first
things
i
first
remember
all
about
my
uncle
first
but
i
keep
him
to
the
last
next
all
about
rover
the
dog
though
for
roving
i
hardly
remember
him
away
from
my
side
alas
he
did
not
live
to
come
into
the
story
but
i
must
mention
him
here
for
i
shall
not
write
another
book
and
in
the
briefest
summary
of
my
childhood
to
make
no
allusion
to
him
would
be
disloyalty
i
almost
believe
that
at
one
period
had
i
been
set
to
say
who
i
was
i
should
have
included
rover
as
an
essential
part
of
myself
his
tail
was
my
tail
his
legs
were
my
legs
his
tongue
was
my
tongue
so
much
more
did
i
as
we
gambolled
together
seem
conscious
of
his
joy
than
of
my
own
surely
among
other
and
greater
mercies
i
shall
find
him
again
the
next
person
i
see
busy
about
the
place
now
here
now
there
in
the
house
and
seldom
outside
it
is
miss
martha
moon
the
house
is
large
built
at
a
time
when
the
family
was
one
of
consequence
and
there
was
always
much
to
be
done
in
it
the
largest
room
in
it
is
now
called
the
kitchen
but
was
doubtless
called
the
hall
when
first
it
was
built
this
was
miss
martha
moon
headquarters
she
was
my
uncle
second
cousin
and
as
he
always
called
her
martha
so
did
i
without
rebuke
every
one
else
about
the
place
called
her
miss
martha
of
much
greater
worth
and
much
more
genuine
refinement
than
tens
of
thousands
the
world
calls
ladies
she
never
claimed
the
distinction
indeed
she
strongly
objected
to
it
if
you
had
said
or
implied
she
was
a
lady
she
would
have
shrunk
as
from
a
covert
reflection
on
the
quality
of
her
work
had
she
known
certain
of
such
as
nowadays
call
themselves
i
could
have
understood
her
objection
i
think
however
it
came
from
a
stern
adherence
to
the
factness
if
i
may
coin
the
word
of
things
she
never
called
a
lie
a
fib
when
she
was
angry
she
always
held
her
tongue
she
feared
being
unfair
she
had
indeed
a
rare
power
of
silence
to
this
day
i
do
not
but
am
nevertheless
sure
that
by
an
instinct
of
understanding
she
saw
into
my
uncle
trouble
and
descried
more
or
less
plainly
the
secret
of
it
while
yet
she
never
even
alluded
to
the
existence
of
such
a
trouble
she
had
a
regard
for
woman
dignity
as
profound
as
silent
she
was
not
of
those
that
prate
or
rave
about
their
rights
forget
their
duties
and
care
only
for
what
they
count
their
victories
she
declared
herself
dead
against
marriage
one
day
while
yet
hardly
more
than
a
child
i
said
to
her
thoughtfully
i
wonder
why
you
hate
gentlemen
martha
hate
what
on
earth
makes
you
say
such
a
wicked
thing
orbie
she
answered
hate
the
poor
dears
i
love
what
did
you
ever
see
to
make
you
think
i
hated
your
uncle
now
oh
of
course
uncle
i
returned
for
my
uncle
was
all
the
world
to
me
nobody
could
hate
uncle
she
be
a
bad
woman
anyhow
that
did
rejoined
martha
but
did
anybody
ever
hate
the
person
that
could
do
without
her
orbie
my
name
suggested
by
my
uncle
because
my
mother
died
at
my
birth
was
a
curious
one
i
believe
he
made
it
himself
it
was
and
it
means
i
do
know
martha
i
replied
well
you
watch
and
see
she
returned
do
you
think
i
would
stay
here
and
work
from
morning
to
night
if
i
had
some
reason
for
it
oh
i
like
work
she
went
on
i
do
deny
that
i
should
be
miserable
if
i
did
work
but
i
not
bound
to
this
sort
of
work
i
have
money
of
my
own
and
i
no
beggar
for
but
rather
than
leave
your
uncle
poor
man
i
would
do
the
work
of
a
ploughman
for
then
why
do
you
marry
him
martha
i
said
with
innocent
impertinence
marry
him
i
would
marry
him
for
ten
thousand
pounds
child
why
not
if
you
love
him
so
much
i
sure
he
would
mind
marry
him
repeated
miss
martha
and
stood
looking
at
me
as
if
here
at
last
was
a
creature
she
could
understand
marry
the
poor
dear
man
and
make
him
miserable
i
could
love
any
man
better
than
that
just
you
open
your
eyes
my
dear
and
see
what
goes
on
about
you
do
you
see
so
many
men
made
happy
by
their
wives
i
do
say
it
all
the
fault
poor
things
but
the
fact
the
same
there
the
poor
husbands
all
the
time
trying
hard
to
bear
it
what
with
the
babies
and
the
headaches
and
the
rest
of
it
that
what
it
comes
to
the
husbands
are
not
happy
no
no
a
woman
can
do
better
for
a
man
than
marry
him
but
may
it
be
the
husband
fault
sometimes
martha
it
may
but
what
better
is
it
for
that
what
better
is
the
wife
for
knowing
it
or
how
much
happier
the
husband
for
not
knowing
it
as
soon
as
you
come
to
weighing
who
in
fault
and
counting
how
much
it
all
up
with
the
marriage
there
no
more
comfort
in
life
for
either
of
them
women
are
sent
into
the
world
to
make
men
happy
i
was
sent
to
your
uncle
and
i
trying
to
do
my
duty
it
nothing
to
me
what
other
women
think
i
here
to
serve
your
uncle
what
comes
of
me
i
do
care
so
long
as
i
do
my
work
and
do
keep
him
waiting
that
made
me
for
it
you
may
think
it
a
small
thing
to
make
a
man
happy
i
do
god
thought
him
worth
making
and
he
would
be
if
he
was
miserable
i
seen
one
woman
make
ten
men
unhappy
i
know
my
calling
orbie
nothing
would
make
me
marry
one
of
them
poor
things
but
if
they
all
said
as
you
do
martha
no
doubt
the
world
would
come
to
an
end
but
it
would
go
out
singing
not
crying
i
do
see
that
would
matter
there
would
be
enough
to
make
each
other
happy
in
heaven
and
the
lord
could
make
more
as
they
were
uncle
says
it
takes
god
a
long
time
to
make
a
man
i
ventured
to
remark
miss
martha
was
silent
for
a
moment
she
did
not
see
how
my
remark
bore
on
the
matter
in
hand
but
she
had
such
respect
for
anything
my
uncle
said
that
when
she
did
not
grasp
it
she
held
her
peace
anyhow
there
no
fear
of
it
for
the
present
she
answered
you
heard
the
screed
of
banns
last
sunday
i
thought
you
would
have
a
better
idea
of
miss
martha
moon
from
hearing
her
talk
than
from
any
talk
about
her
to
hear
one
talk
is
better
than
to
see
one
but
i
would
not
have
you
think
she
often
spoke
at
such
length
she
was
in
truth
a
woman
of
few
words
never
troubled
or
troubling
with
any
verbal
catarrh
especially
silent
she
was
when
any
one
she
loved
was
in
distress
i
have
seen
her
stand
moveless
for
moments
with
a
look
that
was
the
incarnation
of
essential
motherhood
as
if
her
eyes
were
swallowing
up
sorrow
as
if
her
soul
was
ready
to
be
the
sacrifice
for
sin
then
she
would
turn
away
with
a
droop
of
the
that
seemed
to
say
she
saw
what
it
was
but
saw
also
how
little
she
could
do
for
it
oh
the
depth
of
the
in
those
eyes
of
hers
martha
never
set
herself
to
teach
me
anything
but
i
could
not
know
martha
without
learning
something
of
the
genuine
human
heart
i
gathered
from
her
by
unconscious
assimilation
possibly
a
spiritual
action
analogous
to
exosmose
and
endosmose
takes
place
between
certain
souls
chapter
iii
my
uncle
now
i
must
tell
you
what
my
uncle
was
like
the
first
thing
that
struck
you
about
him
would
have
been
how
tall
and
thin
he
was
the
next
thing
would
have
been
how
he
stooped
and
the
next
how
sad
he
looked
it
scarcely
seemed
that
martha
moon
had
been
able
to
do
much
for
him
yet
doubtless
she
had
done
and
was
doing
more
than
either
he
or
she
knew
he
had
rather
a
small
head
on
the
top
of
his
long
body
and
when
he
stood
straight
up
which
was
not
very
often
it
seemed
so
far
away
that
some
one
said
he
took
him
for
zacchaeus
looking
down
from
the
sycomore
never
thought
of
analyzing
his
appearance
never
thought
of
comparing
him
with
any
one
else
to
me
he
was
the
best
and
most
beautiful
of
men
the
first
man
in
all
the
world
nor
did
i
change
my
mind
about
him
ever
i
only
came
to
want
another
to
think
of
him
as
i
did
his
features
were
in
fine
proportion
though
perhaps
too
delicate
perhaps
they
were
a
little
too
small
to
be
properly
beautiful
when
first
i
saw
a
likeness
of
the
poet
shelley
i
called
out
my
uncle
and
immediately
began
to
see
differences
he
wore
a
small
but
long
moustache
brushed
away
from
his
mouth
and
over
it
his
eyes
looked
large
they
were
of
a
clear
gray
and
very
gentle
i
know
from
the
testimony
of
others
that
i
was
right
in
imagining
him
a
really
learned
man
that
small
head
of
his
contained
more
and
better
than
many
a
larger
head
of
greater
note
he
was
constantly
reading
that
is
when
not
thinking
or
giving
me
the
lessons
which
make
me
now
thank
him
for
half
my
conscious
soul
reading
or
writing
or
thinking
he
made
me
always
welcome
to
share
his
room
with
him
but
he
seldom
took
me
out
walking
he
was
by
no
means
regular
in
his
habits
regarded
neither
times
nor
seasons
went
and
came
like
a
bird
his
hour
for
going
out
was
unknown
to
himself
was
seldom
two
days
together
the
same
he
would
rise
up
suddenly
even
in
the
middle
of
a
lesson
he
always
called
it
a
lesson
together
and
without
a
word
walk
from
the
room
and
the
house
i
had
soon
observed
that
in
gloomy
weather
he
went
out
often
in
the
sunshine
seldom
the
house
had
a
large
garden
of
a
very
sort
such
a
place
for
the
charm
of
both
glory
and
gloom
as
i
have
never
seen
elsewhere
i
have
had
other
eyes
opened
within
me
to
deeper
beauties
than
i
saw
in
that
garden
then
my
remembrance
of
it
is
none
the
less
of
an
enchanted
ground
but
my
uncle
never
walked
in
it
when
he
walked
it
was
always
out
on
the
moor
he
went
and
what
time
he
would
return
no
one
ever
knew
his
meals
were
uninteresting
to
him
no
concern
to
any
one
but
martha
who
never
uttered
a
word
of
impatience
and
seldom
a
word
of
anxiety
at
whatever
hour
of
the
day
he
went
it
was
almost
always
night
when
he
came
home
often
late
night
in
the
house
he
much
preferred
his
own
room
to
any
other
this
room
not
so
large
as
the
but
quite
as
long
seems
to
me
when
i
look
back
my
earliest
surrounding
it
was
the
centre
from
which
my
roving
fancies
issued
as
from
their
source
and
the
end
of
their
journey
to
which
as
to
their
home
they
returned
it
was
a
curious
place
were
you
to
see
first
the
inside
of
the
house
and
then
the
outside
you
would
find
yourself
at
a
loss
to
conjecture
where
within
it
could
be
situated
such
a
room
it
was
not
however
contained
in
what
to
a
cursory
glance
passed
for
the
habitable
house
and
a
stranger
would
not
easily
have
found
the
entrance
to
it
both
its
nature
and
situation
were
in
keeping
with
certain
peculiarities
of
my
uncle
mental
being
he
was
given
to
curious
inquiries
he
would
set
out
to
solve
now
one
now
another
historical
point
as
odd
as
uninteresting
to
any
but
a
mind
capable
of
starting
such
a
question
to
determine
it
he
would
search
book
after
book
as
if
it
were
a
live
thing
in
whose
memory
must
remain
darkly
stored
thousands
of
facts
requiring
only
to
be
recollected
amongst
them
might
nestle
the
thing
he
sought
and
he
would
dig
for
it
as
in
a
mine
that
went
branching
through
the
hardened
dust
of
ages
i
fancy
he
read
any
old
book
whatever
of
english
history
with
the
haunting
sense
that
next
moment
he
might
come
upon
the
trace
of
certain
of
his
own
ancestors
of
whom
he
specially
desired
to
enlarge
his
knowledge
whether
he
started
any
new
thing
in
mathematics
i
can
not
tell
but
he
would
sit
absorbed
every
day
and
all
day
long
for
weeks
over
his
slate
suddenly
throw
it
down
walk
out
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
leave
his
calculus
or
whatever
it
was
for
months
he
read
shakespeare
as
with
a
microscope
propounding
and
answering
the
most
curious
little
questions
it
seemed
to
me
sometimes
i
confess
that
he
missed
a
plain
point
from
his
eyes
being
so
sharp
that
they
looked
through
it
without
seeing
it
having
focused
themselves
beyond
it
a
specimen
of
the
kind
of
question
he
would
ask
and
answer
himself
occurs
to
me
as
i
write
for
he
put
it
to
me
once
as
we
read
together
why
he
said
did
margaret
in
ado
about
try
to
persuade
hero
to
wear
her
other
rabato
and
the
answer
was
because
she
feared
her
mistress
would
find
out
that
she
had
been
wearing
it
namely
the
night
before
when
she
personated
and
here
i
may
put
down
a
remark
i
heard
him
make
in
reference
to
a
theory
which
itself
must
seem
nothing
less
than
idiotic
to
any
one
who
knows
shakespeare
as
my
uncle
knew
him
the
remark
was
this
that
whoever
sought
to
enhance
the
fame
of
lord
alban
he
was
careful
to
use
the
real
title
by
attributing
to
him
the
works
of
shakespeare
must
either
be
a
man
of
weak
intellect
of
great
ignorance
or
of
low
moral
perception
for
he
cast
on
the
memory
of
a
man
already
more
to
be
pitied
than
any
a
weight
of
obloquy
such
as
it
were
hard
to
believe
anyone
capable
of
deserving
a
being
with
shakespeare
love
of
human
nature
and
bacon
insight
into
essential
truth
guilty
of
the
moral
and
social
atrocities
into
which
his
lordship
eagerness
after
money
for
scientific
research
betrayed
him
would
be
a
monster
as
grotesque
as
abominable
i
record
the
remark
the
rather
that
it
shows
my
uncle
could
look
at
things
in
a
large
way
as
well
as
hunt
with
a
at
the
same
time
devoutly
as
i
honour
him
i
can
not
but
count
him
intended
for
thinkings
of
larger
scope
than
such
as
then
seemed
characteristic
of
him
i
imagine
his
early
history
had
affected
his
faculties
and
influenced
the
mode
of
their
working
how
indeed
could
it
have
been
otherwise
chapter
iv
my
uncle
room
and
my
uncle
in
it
at
right
angles
to
the
long
black
and
white
house
stood
a
building
behind
it
of
possibly
earlier
date
but
uncertain
intent
it
had
been
used
for
many
things
before
my
uncle
time
once
as
part
of
a
small
brewery
my
uncle
was
positive
that
whether
built
for
the
purpose
or
not
it
had
been
used
as
a
chapel
and
that
the
house
was
originally
the
cell
of
some
convent
the
signs
on
which
he
founded
this
conclusion
i
was
never
able
to
appreciate
to
me
as
containing
my
uncle
study
the
of
my
childhood
it
was
far
more
interesting
than
any
history
could
have
made
it
it
had
very
thick
walls
two
low
stories
and
a
high
roof
entering
it
from
the
court
behind
the
house
every
portion
of
it
would
seem
to
an
ordinary
beholder
quite
accounted
for
but
it
might
have
suggested
itself
to
a
more
comprehending
observer
that
a
considerable
space
must
lie
between
the
roof
and
the
low
ceiling
of
the
first
floor
which
was
taken
up
with
the
servants
rooms
of
the
ground
floor
part
was
used
as
a
dairy
part
as
a
woodhouse
part
for
certain
vegetables
while
part
stored
the
turf
dug
for
fuel
from
the
neighbouring
moor
between
this
building
and
the
house
was
a
smaller
and
lower
erection
a
mere
it
also
was
strongly
built
however
and
the
roof
in
perfect
condition
seemed
newer
than
the
walls
it
had
been
raised
and
strengthened
when
used
by
my
uncle
to
contain
a
passage
leading
from
the
house
to
the
roof
of
the
building
just
described
in
which
he
was
fashioning
for
himself
the
retreat
which
he
rightly
called
his
study
for
few
must
be
the
rooms
more
continuously
thought
and
read
in
during
one
lifetime
than
this
i
have
now
to
tell
how
it
was
reached
from
the
house
you
could
hardly
have
found
the
way
to
it
even
had
you
set
yourself
seriously
to
the
task
without
having
in
you
a
good
share
of
the
constructive
faculty
the
whole
was
my
uncle
contrivance
but
might
well
have
been
supposed
to
belong
to
the
troubled
times
when
a
good
would
have
added
to
the
value
of
any
home
there
was
a
large
recess
in
the
kitchen
of
which
the
hearth
raised
a
foot
or
so
above
the
flagged
floor
had
filled
the
whole
a
huge
chimney
in
fact
built
out
from
the
wall
at
some
later
time
an
oblong
space
had
been
cut
out
of
the
hearth
to
a
level
with
the
floor
and
in
it
an
iron
grate
constructed
for
the
more
convenient
burning
of
coal
hence
the
remnant
of
the
raised
hearth
looked
like
wide
hobs
to
the
grate
the
recess
as
a
was
thereby
spoiled
for
coal
makes
a
very
different
kind
of
smoke
from
the
aromatic
product
of
wood
or
peat
right
and
left
within
the
recess
were
two
common
unpainted
doors
with
latches
if
you
opened
either
you
found
an
ordinary
shallow
cupboard
that
on
the
right
filled
with
shelves
and
crockery
that
on
the
left
with
brooms
and
other
household
implements
but
if
in
the
frame
of
the
door
to
the
left
you
pressed
what
looked
like
the
head
of
a
large
nail
not
its
door
only
but
the
whole
cupboard
turned
inward
on
unseen
hinges
and
revealed
an
ascending
stair
which
was
the
approach
to
my
uncle
room
at
the
head
of
the
stair
you
went
through
the
wall
of
the
house
to
the
passage
under
the
roof
of
the
at
the
end
of
which
a
few
more
steps
led
up
to
the
door
of
the
study
by
that
door
you
entered
the
roof
of
the
more
ancient
building
lighted
almost
entirely
from
above
there
was
no
indication
outside
of
the
existence
of
this
floor
except
one
tiny
window
with
vaguely
pointed
arch
almost
in
the
very
top
of
the
gable
here
lay
my
nest
this
was
the
bower
of
my
bliss
its
walls
rose
but
about
three
feet
from
the
floor
ere
the
slope
of
the
roof
began
so
that
there
was
a
considerable
portion
of
the
room
in
which
my
tall
uncle
could
not
stand
upright
there
was
width
enough
notwithstanding
in
which
four
as
tall
as
he
might
have
walked
abreast
up
and
down
a
length
of
at
least
five
and
thirty
feet
not
merely
the
low
walls
but
the
slopes
of
the
roof
were
filled
with
books
as
high
as
the
narrow
level
portion
of
the
ceiling
on
the
slopes
the
bookshelves
had
of
course
to
be
peculiar
my
uncle
had
contrived
and
partly
himself
made
them
with
the
assistance
of
a
carpenter
he
had
known
all
his
life
they
were
individually
fixed
to
the
rafters
each
projecting
over
that
beneath
it
to
get
at
the
highest
he
had
to
stand
on
a
few
steps
to
reach
the
lowest
he
had
to
stoop
at
a
right
angle
the
place
was
almost
a
tunnel
of
books
by
setting
a
chair
on
an
ancient
chest
that
stood
against
the
gable
and
a
footstool
on
the
chair
i
could
mount
high
enough
to
get
into
the
deep
embrasure
of
the
little
window
whence
alone
to
gain
a
glimpse
of
the
lower
world
while
from
the
floor
i
could
see
heaven
through
six
skylights
deep
framed
in
books
as
far
back
as
i
can
remember
it
was
my
care
to
see
that
the
inside
of
their
glass
was
always
bright
so
that
sun
and
moon
and
stars
might
look
in
the
books
were
mostly
in
old
and
dingy
bindings
but
there
were
a
few
to
attract
the
eyes
of
a
child
especially
some
annuals
in
red
skil
or
embossed
leather
or
most
bewitching
of
all
in
paper
protected
by
a
tight
case
of
the
same
from
which
with
the
help
of
a
ribbon
you
drew
out
the
precious
little
green
volume
with
its
gilt
edges
and
lovely
engravings
one
of
which
in
particular
i
remember
a
castle
in
the
distance
a
wood
a
ghastly
man
at
the
head
of
a
rearing
horse
and
a
white
fleeting
ghost
the
cause
of
the
consternation
these
books
had
a
large
share
in
the
witchery
of
the
chamber
at
the
end
of
the
room
near
the
but
under
one
of
the
skylights
was
a
table
of
white
deal
without
cover
at
which
my
uncle
generally
sat
sometimes
writing
oftener
leaning
over
a
book
occasionally
however
he
would
occupy
a
large
easy
chair
under
the
slope
of
the
roof
in
the
same
end
of
the
room
sitting
silent
neither
writing
nor
reading
his
eyes
fixed
straight
before
him
but
plainly
upon
nothing
they
looked
as
if
sights
were
going
out
of
them
rather
than
coming
in
at
them
when
he
sat
thus
i
would
sit
gazing
at
him
oh
how
i
loved
him
loved
every
line
of
his
gentle
troubled
countenance
i
do
not
remember
the
time
when
i
did
not
know
that
his
face
was
troubled
it
gave
the
last
finishing
tenderness
to
my
love
for
him
it
was
from
no
meddlesome
curiosity
that
i
sat
watching
him
from
no
longing
to
learn
what
he
was
thinking
about
or
what
pictures
were
going
and
coming
before
the
eyes
of
his
mind
but
from
such
a
longing
to
comfort
him
as
amounted
to
pain
i
think
it
was
the
desire
to
be
near
him
in
spirit
i
mean
for
i
could
be
near
him
in
the
body
any
time
except
when
he
was
out
on
one
of
his
lonely
walks
or
rides
that
made
me
attend
so
closely
to
my
studies
he
taught
me
everything
and
i
yearned
to
please
him
but
without
this
other
yearning
i
do
not
believe
i
should
ever
have
made
the
progress
he
praised
i
took
indeed
a
true
delight
in
learning
but
i
would
not
so
often
have
shut
the
book
i
was
enjoying
to
the
full
and
taken
up
another
but
for
the
sight
or
the
thought
of
my
uncle
countenance
i
think
he
never
once
sat
down
in
the
chair
i
have
mentioned
without
sooner
or
later
rising
hurriedly
and
going
out
on
one
of
his
solitary
rambles
when
we
were
having
our
lessons
together
as
he
phrased
it
we
sat
at
the
table
side
by
side
and
he
taught
me
as
if
we
were
two
children
finding
out
together
what
it
all
meant
those
lessons
had
i
think
the
largest
share
in
the
charm
of
the
place
yet
when
as
not
unfrequently
my
uncle
would
in
the
middle
of
one
of
them
rise
abruptly
and
leave
me
without
a
word
to
go
i
knew
far
away
from
the
house
i
was
neither
dismayed
nor
uneasy
i
had
got
used
to
the
thing
before
i
could
wonder
what
it
meant
i
would
just
go
back
to
the
book
i
had
been
reading
or
to
any
other
that
attracted
me
he
never
required
the
preparation
of
any
lessons
it
was
of
no
use
to
climb
to
the
window
in
the
hope
of
catching
sight
of
him
for
thence
was
nothing
to
be
seen
immediately
below
but
the
tops
of
high
trees
and
a
corner
of
the
yard
into
which
the
opened
and
my
uncle
was
never
there
he
neither
understood
nor
cared
about
farming
his
elder
brother
my
father
had
been
bred
to
carry
on
the
of
the
family
and
my
uncle
was
trained
to
the
medical
profession
my
father
dying
rather
suddenly
my
uncle
who
was
abroad
at
the
time
and
had
not
begun
to
practise
returned
to
take
his
place
but
never
paid
practical
attention
to
the
farming
any
more
than
to
his
profession
he
gave
the
land
in
charge
to
a
bailiff
and
at
once
settled
down
martha
told
me
into
what
we
now
saw
him
she
seemed
to
imply
that
grief
at
my
death
was
the
cause
of
his
depression
but
i
soon
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
lasted
too
long
to
be
so
accounted
for
gradually
i
grew
aware
so
gradually
that
at
length
i
seemed
to
have
known
it
from
the
first
that
the
soul
of
my
uncle
was
harassed
with
an
undying
trouble
that
some
worm
lay
among
the
very
roots
of
his
life
what
change
could
ever
dispel
such
a
sadness
as
i
often
saw
in
that
chair
now
and
then
he
would
sit
there
for
hours
an
open
book
in
his
hand
perhaps
at
which
he
cast
never
a
glance
all
unaware
of
the
eyes
of
the
small
maiden
fixed
upon
him
with
a
whole
world
of
sympathy
behind
them
i
suspect
however
as
i
believe
i
have
said
that
martha
moon
in
her
silence
had
pierced
the
heart
of
the
mystery
though
she
nothing
one
practical
lesson
given
me
now
and
then
in
varying
form
by
my
uncle
i
at
length
one
day
suddenly
and
involuntarily
associated
with
the
darkness
that
haunted
him
in
substance
it
was
this
never
my
little
one
hide
anything
from
those
that
love
you
never
let
anything
that
makes
itself
a
nest
in
your
heart
grow
into
a
secret
for
then
at
once
it
will
begin
to
eat
a
hole
in
he
would
so
often
say
the
kind
of
thing
that
i
seemed
to
know
when
it
was
coming
but
i
had
heard
it
as
a
thing
of
course
never
realizing
its
truth
and
listening
to
it
only
because
he
whom
i
loved
said
it
i
see
with
my
mind
eye
the
fine
small
head
and
large
eyes
so
far
above
me
as
we
sit
beside
each
other
at
the
deal
table
he
looked
down
on
me
like
a
bird
of
prey
his
hair
gray
martha
told
me
before
he
was
thirty
was
tufted
out
a
little
like
ruffled
feathers
on
each
side
but
the
eyes
were
not
those
of
an
eagle
they
were
a
dove
eyes
a
secret
little
one
is
a
mole
that
burrows
said
my
uncle
the
moment
of
insight
was
come
a
voice
seemed
suddenly
to
say
within
me
he
has
a
secret
it
is
biting
his
heart
my
affection
my
devotion
my
sacred
concern
for
him
as
suddenly
swelled
to
twice
their
size
it
was
as
if
a
god
were
in
pain
and
i
could
not
help
him
i
had
no
desire
to
learn
his
secret
i
only
yearned
heart
and
soul
to
comfort
him
before
long
i
had
a
secret
myself
for
half
a
day
ever
after
i
shared
so
in
the
trouble
of
his
secret
that
i
seemed
myself
to
possess
or
rather
to
be
possessed
by
one
such
a
secret
that
i
did
not
myself
know
it
but
in
truth
i
had
a
secret
then
for
the
moment
i
knew
that
he
had
a
secret
his
secret
the
outward
fact
of
its
existence
i
mean
was
my
secret
and
besides
this
secret
of
his
i
had
then
a
secret
of
my
own
for
i
knew
that
my
uncle
had
a
secret
and
he
did
not
know
that
i
knew
therewith
came
of
course
the
question
ought
i
to
tell
him
at
once
by
the
instinct
of
love
i
saw
that
to
tell
him
would
put
him
in
a
great
difficulty
he
might
wish
me
never
to
let
any
one
else
know
of
it
and
how
could
he
say
so
when
he
had
been
constantly
warning
me
to
let
nothing
grow
to
a
secret
in
my
heart
as
to
telling
martha
moon
much
as
i
loved
her
much
as
i
knew
she
loved
my
uncle
and
sure
as
i
was
that
anything
concerning
him
was
as
sacred
to
her
as
to
me
i
dared
not
commit
such
a
breach
of
confidence
as
even
to
think
in
her
presence
that
my
uncle
had
a
secret
from
that
hour
i
had
recurrent
fits
of
a
morbid
terror
at
the
very
idea
of
a
secret
as
if
a
secret
were
in
itself
a
treacherous
poisonous
guest
that
ate
away
the
life
of
its
host
but
to
return
my
came
in
this
wise
chapter
my
first
secret
i
was
one
morning
with
my
uncle
in
his
room
lessons
were
over
and
i
was
reading
a
marvellous
story
in
one
of
my
favourite
annuals
my
uncle
had
so
taught
me
from
infancy
the
right
handling
of
books
that
he
would
have
trusted
me
with
the
most
valuable
in
his
possession
i
do
not
know
how
old
i
was
but
that
is
no
matter
man
or
woman
is
aged
according
to
the
development
of
the
conscience
looking
up
i
saw
him
stooping
over
an
open
drawer
in
a
cabinet
behind
the
door
i
sat
on
the
great
chest
under
the
and
was
away
from
him
the
whole
length
of
the
room
he
had
never
told
me
not
to
look
at
him
had
never
seemed
to
object
to
the
presence
of
my
eyes
on
anything
he
did
and
as
a
matter
of
course
i
sat
observing
him
partly
because
i
had
never
seen
any
portion
of
that
cabinet
open
he
turned
towards
the
near
him
and
held
up
between
him
and
it
a
small
something
of
which
i
could
just
see
that
it
was
red
and
shone
in
the
light
then
he
turned
hurriedly
threw
it
in
the
drawer
and
went
straight
out
leaving
the
drawer
open
i
knew
i
had
lost
his
company
for
the
day
the
moment
he
was
gone
the
phantasm
of
the
pretty
thing
he
had
been
looking
at
so
intently
came
back
to
me
somehow
i
seemed
to
understand
that
i
had
no
right
to
know
what
it
was
seeing
my
uncle
had
not
shown
it
me
at
the
same
time
i
had
no
law
to
guide
me
he
had
never
said
i
was
not
to
look
at
this
or
that
in
the
room
if
he
had
even
if
the
cabinet
had
not
been
mentioned
i
do
not
think
i
should
have
offended
but
that
does
not
make
the
fault
less
for
which
is
the
more
guilty
the
man
who
knows
there
is
a
law
against
doing
a
certain
thing
and
does
it
or
the
man
who
feels
an
authority
in
the
depth
of
his
nature
forbidding
the
thing
and
yet
does
it
surely
the
latter
is
greatly
the
more
guilty
i
rose
and
went
to
the
cabinet
but
when
the
contents
of
the
drawer
began
to
show
themselves
as
i
drew
near
i
closed
my
lids
and
kept
them
close
until
i
had
seated
myself
on
the
floor
with
my
back
to
the
cabinet
and
the
drawer
projecting
over
my
head
like
the
shelf
of
a
bracket
over
its
supporting
figure
i
could
touch
it
with
the
top
of
my
head
by
straightening
my
back
how
long
i
sat
there
motionless
i
can
not
say
but
it
seems
in
retrospect
at
least
a
week
such
a
multitude
of
thinkings
went
through
my
mind
the
logical
discussion
of
a
thing
that
has
to
be
done
a
thing
awaiting
action
and
not
decision
the
experiment
that
is
whether
the
duty
or
the
temptation
has
the
more
to
say
for
itself
is
one
of
the
straight
roads
to
the
pit
similarly
there
are
multitudes
who
lose
their
lives
pondering
what
they
ought
to
believe
while
something
lies
at
their
door
waiting
to
be
done
and
rendering
it
impossible
for
him
who
makes
it
wait
ever
to
know
what
to
believe
only
a
pure
heart
can
understand
and
a
pure
heart
is
one
that
sends
out
ready
hands
i
knew
perfectly
well
what
i
ought
to
do
namely
to
shut
that
drawer
with
the
back
of
my
head
then
get
up
and
do
something
and
forget
the
shining
stone
i
had
seen
betwixt
my
uncle
finger
and
thumb
yet
there
i
sat
debating
whether
i
was
not
at
liberty
to
do
in
my
room
what
he
had
not
told
me
not
to
do
i
will
not
weary
my
reader
with
any
further
description
of
the
evil
path
by
which
i
arrived
at
the
evil
act
to
myself
it
is
pain
even
now
to
tell
that
i
got
on
my
feet
saw
a
blaze
of
shining
things
the
drawer
and
knew
that
eve
had
eaten
the
apple
the
eyes
of
my
consciousness
were
opened
to
the
evil
in
me
through
the
evil
done
by
me
evil
seemed
now
a
part
of
myself
so
that
nevermore
should
i
get
rid
of
it
it
may
be
easy
for
one
regarding
it
from
afar
through
the
telescope
only
of
a
book
to
exclaim
such
a
little
thing
but
it
was
i
who
did
it
and
not
another
it
was
i
and
only
i
who
could
know
what
i
had
done
and
it
was
not
a
little
thing
that
peep
into
my
uncle
drawer
lies
in
my
soul
the
type
of
sin
never
have
i
done
anything
wrong
with
such
a
clear
assurance
that
i
was
doing
wrong
as
when
i
did
the
thing
i
had
taken
most
pains
to
reason
out
as
right
like
one
stunned
by
an
electric
shock
i
had
neither
feeling
nor
care
left
for
anything
i
walked
to
the
end
of
the
long
room
as
far
as
i
could
go
from
the
scene
of
my
crime
and
sat
down
on
the
great
chest
with
my
coffin
the
cabinet
facing
me
in
the
distance
the
first
thing
i
think
that
i
grew
conscious
of
was
dreariness
there
was
nothing
interesting
anywhere
what
should
i
do
there
was
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
think
about
not
a
book
worth
reading
story
was
suddenly
dried
up
at
its
fountain
life
was
a
plain
without
if
the
sky
was
not
a
foul
and
pestilent
congregation
of
vapours
it
was
nothing
better
than
a
canopy
of
gray
and
blue
by
degrees
my
thought
settled
on
what
i
had
done
and
in
a
moment
i
realized
it
as
it
was
a
vile
thing
and
i
had
lost
my
life
for
it
this
is
the
nearest
i
can
come
to
the
expression
of
what
i
felt
i
was
simply
in
despair
i
had
done
wrong
and
the
world
had
closed
in
upon
me
the
sky
had
come
down
and
was
crushing
me
the
lid
of
my
coffin
was
closed
i
should
come
no
more
out
but
deliverance
came
speedily
and
in
how
lovely
a
way
into
my
thought
not
into
the
room
came
my
uncle
present
to
my
deepest
consciousness
he
stood
tall
loving
beautiful
sad
i
read
no
rebuke
in
his
countenance
only
sorrow
that
i
had
sinned
and
sympathy
with
my
suffering
because
of
my
sin
then
first
i
knew
that
i
had
him
in
looking
into
his
drawer
then
first
i
saw
it
was
his
being
that
made
the
thing
i
had
done
an
evil
thing
if
the
drawer
had
been
nobody
there
would
have
been
no
wrong
in
looking
into
it
and
what
made
it
so
very
bad
was
that
my
uncle
was
so
good
to
me
with
the
discovery
came
a
rush
of
gladsome
relief
strange
to
say
with
the
clearer
perception
of
the
greatness
of
the
wrong
i
had
done
came
the
gladness
of
redemption
it
was
almost
a
pure
joy
to
find
that
it
was
against
my
uncle
my
own
uncle
that
i
had
sinned
that
joy
was
the
first
gleam
through
a
darkness
that
had
seemed
settled
on
my
soul
for
ever
but
a
brighter
followed
for
thus
spake
the
truth
within
me
the
thing
is
in
your
uncle
hands
he
is
the
lord
of
the
wrong
you
have
done
it
is
to
him
it
makes
you
a
debtor
he
loves
you
and
will
forgive
you
of
course
he
will
he
can
not
make
undone
what
is
done
but
he
will
comfort
you
and
find
some
way
of
setting
things
right
there
must
be
some
way
i
can
not
be
doomed
to
be
a
contemptible
child
to
all
eternity
it
is
so
easy
to
go
wrong
and
so
hard
to
get
right
he
must
help
me
i
sat
the
rest
of
the
day
alone
in
that
solitary
room
away
from
martha
and
rover
and
everybody
i
would
that
even
now
in
my
old
age
i
waited
for
god
as
then
i
waited
for
my
uncle
if
only
he
would
come
that
i
might
pour
out
the
story
of
my
fall
for
i
had
sinned
after
the
similitude
of
adam
transgression
only
i
was
worse
for
neither
serpent
nor
wife
had
tempted
me
at
martha
came
to
find
me
i
would
not
go
with
her
she
would
bring
me
my
tea
she
said
i
would
not
have
any
tea
with
a
look
like
that
she
sometimes
cast
on
my
uncle
she
left
me
dear
martha
she
had
the
lovely
gift
of
leaving
alone
that
evening
there
was
no
tea
in
the
house
martha
did
not
have
any
with
the
conceit
peculiar
to
repentance
and
humiliation
i
took
a
curious
satisfaction
in
being
hard
on
myself
i
could
have
taken
my
meal
tolerably
well
with
the
new
hope
in
my
uncle
as
my
saviour
came
comfort
enough
for
the
natural
process
of
getting
hungry
and
desiring
food
but
with
common
indeed
vulgar
foolishness
my
own
righteousness
in
taking
vengeance
on
my
fault
was
a
satisfaction
to
me
i
did
not
then
see
the
presumption
of
the
sinner
taking
vengeance
on
her
own
fault
did
not
see
that
i
had
no
right
to
do
that
for
how
should
a
thing
defiled
punish
with
all
my
great
joy
in
the
discovery
that
the
fault
was
against
my
uncle
i
forgot
that
therefore
i
was
in
his
jurisdiction
that
he
only
had
to
deal
with
it
he
alone
could
punish
as
he
alone
could
forgive
it
it
was
the
end
of
august
and
the
night
stole
swiftly
upon
the
day
it
began
to
grow
very
dusk
but
i
would
not
stir
i
and
the
cabinet
kept
each
other
dismal
company
while
the
gloom
deepened
into
night
nor
did
the
night
part
us
for
i
and
the
cabinet
filled
all
the
darkness
had
my
uncle
remained
the
whole
night
away
i
believe
i
should
have
sat
till
he
came
but
happily
both
for
my
mental
suffering
and
my
bodily
endurance
he
returned
sooner
than
many
a
time
i
heard
the
open
i
knew
he
would
come
to
the
study
before
going
to
his
bedroom
and
my
heart
gave
a
bound
of
eagerness
i
knew
also
that
martha
never
spoke
to
him
when
he
returned
from
one
of
his
late
rambles
and
that
he
would
not
know
i
was
there
long
before
she
died
martha
knew
how
grateful
he
was
for
her
delicate
consideration
martha
moon
was
not
one
of
this
ladies
but
there
is
a
country
where
the
social
question
is
not
is
she
a
lady
but
how
much
of
a
woman
is
she
martha
name
must
i
think
stand
well
up
in
the
book
of
life
my
uncle
then
approached
his
room
without
knowing
there
was
a
live
kernel
to
the
dark
that
filled
it
i
hearkened
to
every
nearer
step
as
he
came
up
the
stair
along
the
corridor
and
up
the
short
final
ascent
to
the
door
of
the
study
i
had
crept
from
my
place
to
the
middle
of
the
room
and
without
a
thought
of
consequences
stood
waiting
the
arrival
through
the
dark
of
my
deliverer
from
the
dark
i
did
not
know
that
many
a
man
who
would
face
a
battery
calmly
will
spring
a
yard
aside
if
a
yelping
cur
dart
at
him
my
uncle
opened
the
door
and
closed
it
behind
him
his
lamp
and
matches
stood
ready
on
his
table
it
was
my
part
to
see
they
were
there
with
a
sigh
which
seemed
to
seek
me
in
the
darkness
and
find
me
he
came
forward
through
it
i
caught
him
round
the
legs
and
clung
to
him
he
gave
a
great
gasp
and
a
smothered
cry
staggered
and
nearly
fell
my
god
he
murmured
uncle
uncle
i
cried
in
greater
terror
than
he
it
only
orbie
it
only
your
little
one
oh
it
only
my
little
one
is
it
he
rejoined
at
once
recovering
his
equanimity
and
not
for
a
moment
losing
the
temper
so
ready
like
nervous
cat
to
spring
from
most
of
us
when
startled
he
caught
me
up
in
his
arms
and
held
me
to
his
heart
i
could
feel
it
beat
against
my
little
person
uncle
uncle
i
cried
again
do
do
did
i
hurt
you
my
little
one
he
said
and
relaxing
his
embrace
held
me
more
gently
but
did
not
set
me
down
no
no
i
answered
but
i
got
a
secret
and
you
must
kiss
me
till
it
is
gone
i
wish
there
was
a
swine
to
send
it
into
give
it
to
me
little
one
i
will
treat
it
better
than
a
swine
but
it
must
be
treated
uncle
it
might
come
again
there
is
no
fear
of
that
my
child
as
soon
as
a
secret
is
told
it
is
dead
it
is
a
secret
no
will
it
be
dead
uncle
i
returned
but
it
will
be
there
all
the
same
when
it
is
dead
an
ugly
thing
it
will
only
put
off
its
cloak
and
show
itself
all
secrets
are
not
ugly
things
when
their
cloaks
are
off
the
cloak
may
be
the
ugly
thing
and
nothing
he
stood
in
the
dark
holding
me
in
his
arms
but
the
clouds
had
cleared
off
a
little
and
though
there
was
no
moon
i
could
see
the
dim
blue
of
the
and
a
little
shine
from
the
gray
of
his
hair
but
mine
is
an
ugly
thing
i
said
and
i
hate
it
please
let
me
put
it
out
of
my
mouth
perhaps
then
it
will
go
out
with
it
little
put
me
down
please
i
returned
he
walked
to
the
old
chest
under
the
seated
himself
on
it
and
set
me
down
beside
him
i
slipped
from
the
chest
and
knelt
on
the
floor
at
his
feet
a
little
way
in
front
of
him
i
did
not
touch
him
and
all
was
again
quite
dark
about
us
i
told
him
my
story
from
beginning
to
end
along
with
a
great
part
of
my
meditations
while
hesitating
to
do
the
deed
i
felt
very
choky
but
forced
my
way
through
talking
with
a
throat
that
did
not
seem
my
own
and
sending
out
a
voice
i
seemed
never
to
have
heard
before
the
moment
i
ceased
a
sound
like
a
sob
came
out
of
the
darkness
was
it
possible
my
big
uncle
was
crying
then
indeed
there
was
no
hope
for
me
he
was
horrified
at
my
wickedness
and
very
sorry
to
have
to
give
me
up
i
howled
like
a
wild
beast
please
uncle
will
you
kill
me
i
cried
through
a
riot
of
sobs
that
came
from
me
like
potatoes
from
a
sack
yes
yes
i
will
kill
you
my
darling
he
answered
this
way
this
way
and
stretching
out
his
arms
he
found
me
in
the
dark
drew
me
to
him
and
covered
my
face
with
kisses
now
he
resumed
i
killed
you
alive
again
and
the
ugly
secret
is
dead
and
will
never
come
to
life
any
more
and
i
think
besides
we
have
killed
the
hen
that
lays
the
he
rose
with
me
in
his
arms
set
me
down
on
the
chest
lighted
his
lamp
and
carried
it
to
the
cabinet
then
he
returned
and
taking
me
by
the
hand
led
me
to
it
opened
wide
the
drawer
of
offence
lifted
me
and
held
me
so
that
i
could
see
well
into
it
the
light
flashed
in
a
hundred
glories
of
colour
from
a
multitude
of
cut
but
unset
stones
that
lay
loose
in
it
i
soon
learned
that
most
of
them
were
of
small
but
their
beauty
was
none
the
less
entrancing
there
were
stones
of
price
among
them
however
and
these
were
the
first
he
taught
me
because
they
were
the
most
beautiful
my
fault
had
opened
a
new
source
of
delight
my
was
now
one
of
the
great
pleasures
of
the
week
in
after
years
i
saw
in
it
the
richness
of
god
not
content
with
setting
right
what
is
wrong
but
making
from
it
a
gain
he
will
not
have
his
children
the
worse
for
the
wrong
they
have
done
we
shall
lose
nothing
by
it
he
is
our
father
for
the
hurting
he
gives
his
oyster
a
pearl
there
said
my
uncle
you
may
look
at
them
as
often
as
you
please
only
mind
you
put
every
one
back
as
soon
as
you
have
satisfied
your
eyes
with
it
you
must
not
put
one
in
your
pocket
or
carry
it
about
in
your
then
he
set
me
down
saying
now
you
must
go
to
bed
and
dream
about
the
pretty
things
i
will
tell
you
a
lot
of
stories
about
them
we
had
a
way
of
calling
any
kind
of
statement
i
never
cared
to
ask
how
it
was
that
seeing
all
the
same
i
had
done
the
wrong
thing
the
whole
weight
of
it
was
gone
from
me
so
utterly
was
it
gone
that
i
did
not
even
inquire
whether
i
ought
so
to
let
it
pass
from
me
it
was
nowhere
in
the
fire
of
my
uncle
love
to
me
and
mine
to
him
the
thing
vanished
it
was
annihilated
should
i
not
be
a
creature
unworthy
of
life
if
now
in
my
old
age
i
who
had
such
an
uncle
in
my
childhood
did
not
with
my
very
life
believe
in
god
i
have
wondered
whether
if
my
father
had
lived
to
bring
me
up
instead
of
my
uncle
i
should
have
been
very
different
but
the
useless
speculation
has
only
driven
me
to
believe
that
the
relations
on
the
surface
of
life
are
but
the
symbols
of
far
deeper
ties
which
may
exist
without
those
correspondent
external
ones
at
the
same
time
now
that
being
old
i
naturally
think
of
the
coming
change
i
feel
that
when
i
see
my
father
i
shall
have
a
different
feeling
for
him
just
because
he
is
my
father
although
my
uncle
did
all
the
fatherly
toward
me
but
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
about
our
hearts
and
all
their
varying
hues
and
shades
of
feeling
truth
is
at
the
root
of
all
existence
therefore
everything
must
come
right
if
only
we
are
obedient
to
the
truth
and
right
is
the
deepest
satisfaction
of
every
creature
as
well
as
of
god
i
wait
in
confidence
if
things
be
not
as
we
think
they
will
both
arouse
and
satisfy
a
better
making
us
glad
they
are
not
as
we
expected
chapter
vi
i
lose
myself
i
have
one
incident
more
to
relate
ere
my
narrative
begins
to
flow
from
a
quite
clear
memory
i
was
by
no
means
a
small
bookworm
neither
spent
all
my
time
in
the
enchanted
ground
of
my
uncle
study
it
is
true
i
loved
the
house
and
often
felt
like
a
burrowing
animal
that
would
rather
not
leave
its
hole
but
occasionally
even
at
such
times
would
suddenly
wake
the
passion
for
the
open
air
i
must
get
into
it
or
die
i
was
well
known
in
the
farmyard
not
to
the
men
only
but
to
the
animals
also
in
the
absence
of
human
playfellows
they
did
much
to
keep
me
from
selfishness
but
far
beyond
it
i
took
no
unfrequent
flight
always
alone
neither
martha
nor
my
uncle
ever
seemed
to
think
i
needed
looking
after
and
i
am
not
aware
that
i
should
have
gained
anything
by
it
i
speak
for
myself
i
have
no
theories
about
the
bringing
up
of
children
i
went
where
and
when
i
pleased
as
little
challenged
as
my
uncle
himself
like
him
i
took
now
and
then
a
long
ramble
over
the
moor
fearing
nothing
and
knowing
nothing
to
fear
i
went
sometimes
where
it
seemed
as
if
human
foot
could
never
have
trod
before
so
wild
and
waste
was
the
prospect
so
unknown
it
somehow
looked
the
house
was
built
on
the
more
sloping
side
of
a
high
hollow
just
within
the
moor
which
stretched
wide
away
from
the
very
edge
of
the
farm
if
you
climbed
the
slope
following
a
certain
rough
country
road
at
the
top
of
it
you
saw
on
the
one
side
the
farm
in
all
the
colours
and
shades
of
its
outspread
well
tilled
fields
on
the
other
side
the
heath
if
you
went
another
way
through
the
garden
through
the
belt
of
shrubs
and
pines
that
encircled
it
and
through
the
wilderness
behind
that
you
were
at
once
upon
the
heath
if
then
you
went
as
far
as
the
highest
point
in
sight
wading
through
the
heather
among
the
rocks
and
great
stones
which
in
childhood
i
never
doubted
grew
also
you
saw
before
you
nothing
but
a
wide
wild
level
whose
horizon
was
here
and
there
broken
by
low
hills
but
the
seeming
level
was
far
from
flat
or
smooth
as
i
found
on
the
day
of
the
adventure
i
am
about
to
relate
i
wonder
i
had
never
lost
myself
before
i
suppose
then
first
my
legs
were
able
to
wander
beyond
the
ground
with
which
my
eyes
were
familiar
it
had
rained
all
the
morning
and
afternoon
when
our
last
lesson
was
over
my
uncle
went
out
and
i
betook
myself
to
the
barn
where
i
amused
myself
in
the
straw
by
this
time
rover
must
have
gone
back
to
his
maker
for
i
remember
as
with
me
a
large
respectable
dog
of
the
who
endured
me
with
a
patience
that
amounted
almost
to
friendliness
but
never
followed
me
about
when
i
grew
hungry
i
went
into
the
house
to
have
my
it
was
called
tea
but
i
knew
nothing
about
tea
while
in
milk
i
was
a
connoisseur
i
could
tell
perfectly
to
which
of
the
cows
i
was
indebted
for
the
milk
i
happened
at
any
time
to
be
drinking
miss
martha
never
allowed
the
milks
of
the
different
cows
to
be
mingled
just
as
my
meal
was
over
the
sun
shone
with
sudden
brilliance
into
my
very
eyes
the
storm
was
breaking
up
and
vanishing
in
the
west
i
threw
down
my
spoon
and
ran
hatless
as
usual
from
the
house
the
sun
was
on
the
edge
of
the
hollow
i
made
straight
for
him
the
bracken
was
so
wet
that
my
legs
almost
seemed
walking
through
a
brook
and
my
body
through
a
thick
rain
in
a
moment
i
was
sopping
but
to
be
wet
was
of
no
consequence
to
me
not
for
many
years
was
i
able
to
believe
that
damp
could
hurt
when
i
reached
the
top
the
sun
was
yet
some
distance
above
the
horizon
and
i
had
gone
a
good
way
toward
him
before
he
went
down
as
he
sank
he
sent
up
a
wind
which
blew
a
sense
of
coming
dark
the
wind
of
the
sunset
brings
me
ever
since
a
foreboding
of
tears
it
seems
to
say
your
day
is
done
the
hour
of
your
darkness
is
at
it
grew
cold
and
a
feeling
of
threat
filled
the
air
all
about
the
grave
of
the
buried
sun
the
clouds
were
angry
with
dusky
yellow
and
splashes
of
gold
they
lowered
tumulous
and
menacing
then
lo
they
had
lost
courage
their
bulk
melted
off
in
fierce
vapour
gold
and
gray
and
the
sharp
outcry
of
their
shape
was
gone
as
i
recall
the
airy
scene
that
horizon
looks
like
the
void
between
a
cataclysm
and
the
moving
afresh
of
the
spirit
of
god
upon
the
face
of
the
waters
i
went
on
and
on
i
do
not
know
why
something
enticed
me
or
i
was
plunged
in
some
meditation
then
absorbing
now
forgotten
not
necessarily
worthless
i
am
jealous
of
moods
that
can
be
forgotten
but
such
may
leave
traces
in
the
character
i
wandered
on
what
ups
and
downs
there
were
how
uneven
was
the
surface
of
the
moor
the
feet
learned
what
the
eyes
had
not
seen
all
at
once
i
woke
to
the
fact
that
mountains
hemmed
me
in
they
looked
mountains
though
they
were
but
hills
what
had
become
of
home
where
was
it
the
light
lingering
in
the
west
might
surely
have
shown
me
the
direction
of
it
but
i
remember
no
west
nothing
but
a
deep
hollow
and
dark
hills
i
was
lost
i
was
not
exactly
frightened
at
first
i
knew
no
cause
of
dread
i
had
never
seen
a
tramp
even
i
had
no
sense
of
the
inimical
i
knew
nothing
of
the
danger
from
cold
and
exposure
but
awe
of
the
fading
light
and
coming
darkness
awoke
in
me
i
began
to
be
frightened
and
fear
is
like
other
live
things
once
started
it
grows
then
first
i
thought
with
dismay
which
became
terror
of
the
slimy
bogs
and
the
deep
pools
in
them
but
just
as
my
heart
was
dying
within
me
i
looked
to
the
hills
with
no
hope
that
from
them
would
come
my
aid
and
there
on
the
edge
of
the
sky
lifted
against
it
in
a
dip
between
two
of
the
hills
was
the
form
of
a
lady
on
horseback
i
could
see
the
skirt
of
her
habit
flying
out
against
the
clouds
as
she
rode
had
she
been
a
few
feet
lower
so
as
to
come
between
me
and
the
side
of
the
hill
instead
of
the
sky
i
should
not
have
seen
her
neither
should
i
if
she
had
been
a
few
hundred
yards
further
off
i
shrieked
at
the
thought
that
she
did
not
see
me
and
i
could
not
make
her
hear
me
she
started
turned
seemed
to
look
whence
the
cry
could
have
come
but
kept
on
her
way
then
i
shrieked
in
earnest
and
began
to
run
wildly
toward
her
i
think
she
saw
me
that
my
quicker
change
of
place
detached
my
shape
sufficiently
to
make
it
discernible
she
pulled
up
and
sat
like
a
statue
waiting
me
i
kept
on
calling
as
i
ran
to
assure
her
i
was
doing
my
utmost
for
i
feared
she
might
grow
impatient
and
leave
me
but
at
last
it
was
slowly
indeed
i
staggered
up
to
her
spent
my
foot
caught
and
as
i
fell
i
clasped
the
leg
of
her
horse
i
had
no
fear
of
animals
more
than
of
human
beings
he
was
startled
and
rearing
drew
his
leg
from
my
arms
but
he
took
care
not
to
come
down
on
me
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
stood
panting
what
the
lady
said
or
what
i
answered
i
can
not
recall
the
next
thing
i
remember
is
stumbling
along
by
her
side
for
she
made
her
horse
walk
that
i
might
keep
up
with
her
she
talked
a
little
but
i
do
not
remember
what
she
said
it
is
all
a
dream
now
a
one
it
must
have
been
like
a
dream
at
the
time
i
was
so
exhausted
i
remember
a
voice
descending
now
and
then
as
if
from
the
clouds
a
cold
musical
voice
with
something
in
it
that
made
me
not
want
to
hear
it
i
remember
her
saying
that
we
were
near
her
house
and
would
soon
be
there
i
think
she
had
found
out
from
me
where
i
lived
all
the
time
i
never
saw
her
face
it
was
too
dark
i
do
not
think
she
once
spoke
kindly
to
me
she
said
i
had
no
business
to
be
out
alone
she
wondered
at
my
father
and
mother
i
think
i
was
too
tired
to
tell
her
i
had
no
father
or
mother
when
i
did
speak
she
indicated
neither
by
sound
nor
movement
that
she
heard
or
heeded
what
i
said
she
sat
up
above
me
in
the
dark
unpleasant
and
all
but
unseen
a
riddle
which
the
troubled
child
stumbling
along
by
her
horse
side
did
not
want
solved
had
there
been
anything
to
call
light
i
should
have
run
away
from
her
vague
doubts
of
witches
and
ogresses
crossed
my
mind
but
i
said
to
myself
the
stories
about
them
were
not
true
and
kept
on
as
best
i
could
before
we
reached
the
house
we
had
left
the
heath
and
were
moving
along
lanes
the
horse
seemed
to
walk
with
more
confidence
and
it
was
harder
for
me
to
keep
up
with
him
i
was
so
tired
that
i
could
not
feel
my
legs
i
stumbled
often
and
once
the
horse
trod
on
my
foot
i
fell
he
went
on
i
had
to
run
limping
after
him
at
last
we
stopped
i
could
see
nothing
the
lady
gave
a
musical
cry
a
voice
and
footsteps
made
answer
and
presently
came
the
sound
of
a
gate
on
its
hinges
a
long
dark
piece
of
road
followed
i
knew
we
were
among
trees
for
i
heard
the
wind
in
them
over
our
heads
then
i
saw
lights
in
windows
and
presently
we
stopped
at
the
door
of
a
great
house
i
remember
nothing
more
of
that
night

i
woke
the
next
morning
in
a
strange
bed
and
for
a
long
time
could
not
think
how
i
came
to
be
there
a
maid
appeared
and
told
me
it
was
time
to
get
up
greatly
to
my
dislike
she
would
insist
on
dressing
me
my
clothes
looked
very
miserable
i
remember
in
consequence
of
what
they
had
gone
through
the
night
before
she
was
kind
to
me
and
asked
me
a
great
many
questions
but
paid
no
heed
to
my
answers
a
treatment
to
which
i
had
not
been
used
i
think
she
must
have
been
the
lady
maid
when
i
was
ready
she
took
me
to
the
housekeeper
room
where
i
had
bread
and
milk
for
breakfast
several
servants
men
and
women
came
and
went
and
i
thought
they
all
looked
at
me
strangely
i
concluded
they
had
no
little
girls
in
that
house
assuredly
there
was
small
favour
for
children
in
it
in
some
houses
the
child
is
as
a
stranger
in
others
he
rules
neither
such
house
is
in
the
kingdom
of
heaven
i
must
have
looked
a
forlorn
creature
as
i
sat
or
perched
rather
on
the
old
in
that
dingy
room
nobody
said
more
than
a
word
or
so
to
me
i
wondered
what
was
going
to
be
done
with
me
but
i
had
long
been
able
to
wait
for
what
would
come
at
length
after
as
it
seemed
hours
of
weary
waiting
during
which
my
heart
grew
sick
with
longing
after
my
uncle
i
was
without
a
word
of
explanation
led
through
long
passages
into
a
room
which
appeared
enormous
there
i
was
again
left
a
long
while
this
time
alone
it
was
all
white
and
gold
and
had
its
walls
nearly
covered
with
great
mirrors
from
floor
to
ceiling
which
while
it
was
indeed
of
great
size
was
the
cause
of
its
looking
so
immeasurably
large
but
it
was
some
time
before
i
discovered
this
for
i
was
not
accustomed
to
mirrors
except
the
small
one
on
my
little
and
one
still
less
on
martha
i
had
scarcely
seen
a
mirror
and
was
not
prepared
for
those
sheets
of
glass
in
narrow
gold
frames
i
went
about
looking
at
one
thing
and
another
but
handling
nothing
my
late
secret
had
cured
me
of
that
weary
at
last
i
dropped
upon
a
low
chair
and
would
probably
have
soon
fallen
asleep
had
not
the
door
opened
and
some
one
come
in
i
could
not
see
the
door
without
turning
and
was
too
tired
and
sleepy
to
move
i
sat
still
staring
hardly
conscious
into
the
mirror
in
front
of
me
all
at
once
i
descried
in
it
my
uncle
but
only
to
see
him
grow
white
as
death
and
turn
away
reeling
as
if
he
would
fall
the
sight
so
bewildered
me
that
instead
of
rushing
to
embrace
him
i
sat
frozen
he
clapped
his
hands
to
his
eyes
steadied
himself
stood
for
a
moment
rigid
then
came
straight
toward
me
but
to
my
added
astonishment
he
gave
me
no
greeting
or
showed
any
sign
of
joy
at
having
found
me
never
before
had
he
seen
me
for
the
first
time
any
day
without
giving
me
a
kiss
never
before
it
seemed
to
me
had
he
spoken
to
me
without
a
smile
i
had
been
lost
and
was
found
and
he
was
not
glad
the
strange
reception
fell
on
me
like
a
numbing
spell
i
had
nothing
to
say
no
impulse
to
move
no
part
in
the
present
world
he
caught
me
up
in
his
arms
hid
his
face
upon
me
knocked
his
shoulder
heavily
against
the
as
he
went
from
the
room
walked
straight
through
the
hall
and
out
of
the
house
i
think
no
one
saw
us
as
we
went
i
am
sure
neither
of
us
saw
any
one
with
long
strides
he
walked
down
the
avenue
never
turning
his
head
not
until
we
were
on
the
moor
out
of
sight
of
the
house
did
he
stop
then
he
set
me
down
and
then
first
we
discovered
that
he
had
left
his
hat
behind
for
all
his
carrying
of
me
and
going
so
fast
and
i
must
have
been
rather
heavy
his
face
had
no
colour
in
it
shall
i
run
and
get
it
uncle
i
said
as
i
saw
him
raise
his
hand
to
his
head
and
find
no
hat
there
to
be
taken
off
i
should
be
back
in
a
minute
it
was
the
first
word
spoken
between
us
no
my
little
one
he
answered
wiping
his
forehead
his
voice
sounded
far
away
like
that
of
one
speaking
in
a
dream
i
ca
let
you
out
of
my
sight
i
been
wandering
the
moor
all
night
looking
for
you
with
that
he
caught
me
up
again
and
pressing
his
face
to
mine
walked
with
me
thus
for
a
long
quarter
of
a
mile
i
should
think
oh
how
safe
i
felt
and
how
happy
happy
beyond
smiling
i
loved
him
before
but
i
never
knew
before
what
it
was
to
lose
him
and
find
him
again
tell
me
he
said
at
length
i
told
him
all
and
he
did
not
speak
a
word
until
my
tale
was
finished
were
you
very
frightened
he
then
asked
when
you
found
you
had
lost
your
way
and
darkness
was
coming
i
was
frightened
or
i
would
not
have
gone
to
the
lady
but
i
wish
i
had
staid
on
the
moor
for
you
to
find
me
i
knew
you
would
soon
be
out
looking
for
me
until
she
came
i
comforted
myself
with
thinking
that
perhaps
even
then
you
were
on
the
moor
and
i
might
see
you
any
what
else
did
you
think
of
i
thought
that
god
was
out
on
the
moor
and
if
you
were
not
there
he
would
keep
me
ah
said
my
uncle
as
if
thinking
to
himself
she
but
needs
him
the
more
when
i
am
with
her
yes
of
course
i
answered
i
need
him
then
for
you
as
well
as
for
that
is
very
true
my
child
shall
i
tell
you
one
thing
i
thought
of
while
looking
for
you
please
i
thought
how
jesus
father
and
mother
must
have
felt
when
they
were
looking
for
and
they
need
have
been
so
unhappy
if
they
had
thought
who
he
was
need
they
certainly
not
and
i
need
have
been
so
unhappy
if
i
had
thought
who
you
were
but
i
was
terribly
frightened
and
there
i
was
who
am
i
uncle
another
little
one
of
the
same
father
as
why
were
you
frightened
uncle
i
was
afraid
of
your
being
i
hardly
had
time
to
be
frightened
before
the
lady
yes
you
see
i
need
have
been
so
unhappy
my
uncle
always
treated
me
as
if
i
could
understand
him
perfectly
this
came
i
see
now
from
the
essential
childlikeness
of
his
nature
and
from
no
educational
theory
sometimes
he
went
on
i
look
all
around
me
to
see
if
jesus
is
out
anywhere
but
i
have
never
seen
him
yet
we
shall
see
him
one
day
sha
we
i
said
craning
round
to
look
into
his
eyes
which
were
my
earthly
paradise
nor
are
they
a
whit
less
dear
to
me
nay
they
are
dearer
that
he
has
been
in
god
somewhere
that
is
the
heavenly
paradise
for
many
a
year
i
think
so
he
answered
with
a
sigh
that
seemed
to
swell
like
a
against
me
as
i
sat
on
his
arm
i
hope
so
i
live
but
for
that
and
for
one
thing
there
are
some
i
fancy
who
would
blame
him
for
not
being
sure
and
bring
text
after
text
to
prove
that
he
ought
to
have
been
sure
but
oh
those
they
look
to
me
not
like
the
that
jesus
made
fly
but
like
in
a
stuffed
with
texts
the
doubt
of
a
man
like
my
uncle
must
be
a
far
better
thing
than
their
assurance
would
you
have
been
frightened
if
you
had
met
him
on
the
moor
last
night
little
one
he
asked
after
a
pause
oh
no
uncle
i
returned
i
should
have
thought
it
was
you
till
i
came
nearer
and
then
i
should
have
known
who
it
was
he
would
like
a
big
girl
like
me
to
be
frightened
at
him
would
he
indeed
not
answered
my
uncle
fervently
but
again
his
words
brought
with
them
a
great
sigh
and
he
said
no
more
when
we
reached
home
he
gave
me
up
to
martha
and
went
out
again
nor
returned
before
i
was
in
bed
but
he
came
to
my
room
and
waked
me
with
a
kiss
which
sent
me
faster
asleep
than
before
chapter
viii
thanatos
and
zoe
i
think
it
must
have
been
soon
after
this
that
my
uncle
bought
himself
a
horse
i
know
something
of
horses
now
that
is
if
much
riding
and
much
love
suffice
to
give
a
knowledge
of
them
and
the
horse
which
was
a
glory
and
a
wonder
to
me
then
is
a
glory
and
a
wonder
to
me
still
he
was
large
and
powerful
with
less
beauty
but
more
grandeur
than
a
thoroughbred
and
full
of
a
fiery
gentleness
he
was
the
very
horse
for
sir
philip
sidney
one
day
after
he
had
had
him
for
several
months
and
had
let
no
one
saddle
him
but
himself
therefore
knew
him
perfectly
and
knew
that
the
horse
knew
his
master
i
happened
to
be
in
the
yard
as
he
mounted
the
moment
he
was
in
the
saddle
he
bent
down
to
me
and
held
out
his
hand
come
with
me
little
one
he
said
almost
ere
i
knew
i
was
in
the
saddle
before
him
i
grasped
his
hand
instinctively
caught
with
my
foot
at
his
and
was
astride
the
pommel
i
will
not
say
i
sat
very
comfortably
but
the
memory
of
that
day
delight
will
never
leave
me
not
through
all
the
secular
to
there
must
be
a
god
to
the
world
that
could
give
any
such
delight
as
fell
then
to
the
share
of
one
little
girl
i
think
my
uncle
must
soon
after
have
got
another
saddle
for
i
have
no
recollection
of
any
more
discomfort
i
remember
only
the
delight
of
the
motion
of
the
horse
under
me
for
after
this
i
rode
with
him
often
and
he
taught
me
to
ride
as
surely
not
many
have
been
taught
when
he
saw
me
so
at
home
in
my
seat
as
to
require
no
support
he
made
me
change
my
position
and
go
behind
him
there
i
sat
sideways
on
a
cloth
like
a
lady
of
old
time
on
a
pillion
when
i
had
got
used
to
this
my
uncle
made
me
stand
on
the
horse
broad
back
holding
on
by
his
shoulders
and
it
was
wonderful
how
soon
and
how
unconsciously
i
accommodated
myself
to
every
motion
of
the
strength
that
bore
me
learning
to
keep
my
place
by
pure
balance
like
a
i
had
soon
quite
forgotten
to
hold
by
my
uncle
and
without
the
least
support
rode
as
comfortably
and
with
as
much
confidence
as
any
rider
in
a
circus
though
with
a
far
less
easy
pace
under
me
when
my
uncle
found
me
capable
of
this
he
was
much
pleased
though
a
little
nervous
at
times
able
now
to
ride
his
big
horse
any
way
he
brought
me
one
afternoon
the
loveliest
of
shetland
ponies
not
very
small
with
the
ordinary
human
distrust
in
good
i
could
hardly
believe
she
was
meant
for
me
she
was
a
dappled
gray
like
the
twilight
of
a
morning
after
rain
my
uncle
said
he
called
her
zoe
which
means
life
his
own
horse
he
called
thanatos
which
means
death
such
as
understood
it
thought
it
a
terrible
name
to
give
a
horse
for
most
people
are
so
afraid
of
death
that
they
regard
his
very
name
with
awe
my
uncle
had
a
made
for
me
and
after
a
week
found
i
could
give
him
no
more
trouble
with
my
horsewomanship
at
once
i
was
at
home
on
my
new
friend
back
with
vistas
of
delight
innumerable
opening
around
me
and
from
that
day
my
uncle
seldom
rode
without
me
when
he
went
wandering
it
was
almost
always
on
foot
and
then
as
before
he
was
always
alone
the
idea
of
offering
to
accompany
him
on
such
an
occasion
had
never
occurred
to
me
but
one
stormy
autumn
afternoon
most
of
my
memories
seem
of
the
autumn
my
uncle
looked
worse
than
usual
when
he
went
out
and
i
felt
i
think
for
the
first
time
a
vague
uneasiness
about
him
perhaps
i
had
been
thinking
of
him
more
perhaps
i
had
begun
to
wonder
what
the
secret
could
be
that
made
him
so
often
seem
unhappy
anyhow
this
evening
the
desire
awoke
to
be
with
him
in
his
trouble
whatever
it
was
there
was
no
curiosity
in
the
feeling
i
think
only
the
desire
to
serve
him
as
i
had
never
served
him
yet
i
had
been
as
long
as
i
could
remember
always
at
his
beck
or
lightest
call
now
i
wanted
to
come
when
needed
without
being
called
was
it
impossible
a
girl
should
do
anything
for
a
man
in
his
trouble
he
a
great
man
had
helped
a
little
girl
out
of
the
deepest
despair
could
the
little
girl
do
nothing
for
the
great
man
that
the
big
people
should
do
everything
did
not
seem
fair
he
had
told
me
once
that
the
world
was
held
together
by
what
every
one
could
do
that
the
others
could
not
do
there
must
be
something
i
could
do
that
he
could
not
do
the
rain
was
coming
down
on
the
roof
like
the
steady
tramp
of
distant
squadrons
i
was
in
the
study
therefore
near
the
tiles
and
that
was
how
the
rain
always
sounded
upon
them
tramp
tramp
tramp
came
the
whole
army
of
things
riding
riding
to
befall
my
uncle
and
me
tramp
tramp
came
the
troops
of
the
future
to
take
the
citadel
of
the
present
i
was
not
afraid
of
them
neither
sought
to
imagine
myself
afraid
i
had
no
picture
in
my
mind
of
any
evil
that
could
assail
me
a
little
grove
of
black
poplars
under
the
kept
swaying
their
expostulations
and
moaning
their
entreaties
the
great
rushing
blasts
of
the
wind
through
their
rooted
resistance
made
the
music
of
the
band
that
accompanied
the
march
of
the
unknown
i
sat
and
listened
with
the
vague
conviction
that
something
was
being
done
somewhere
it
could
not
be
that
only
the
wind
and
the
trees
and
the
rain
were
in
all
that
wailing
and
marching
the
powers
of
life
and
death
must
somewhere
be
at
work
then
rose
before
me
the
face
of
my
uncle
as
he
walked
from
the
room
haloed
in
a
sorrowful
stillness
if
only
i
could
be
with
him
if
only
i
knew
where
to
seek
him
wishing
wishing
i
sat
and
listened
to
the
rain
and
the
wind
suddenly
i
found
myself
on
my
feet
making
for
the
door
i
would
not
have
ventured
alone
upon
the
moor
in
such
a
night
but
i
should
have
zoe
with
me
who
knew
all
the
ways
of
it
had
doubtless
been
used
to
bogs
in
her
own
country
and
her
mother
before
her
like
a
small
elephant
she
would
put
out
her
little
foot
and
tap
and
sound
to
see
if
the
surface
would
bear
her
if
the
questionable
spot
was
what
it
looked
to
her
mistress
or
what
she
herself
doubted
it
when
she
had
once
made
up
her
mind
in
the
negative
no
foolish
attempt
of
mine
could
overpersuade
her
could
make
her
trust
our
weight
on
it
a
in
a
bog
the
greenest
spots
are
the
most
dangerous
and
zoe
knew
it
the
matted
roots
might
be
afloat
on
a
fathomless
depth
of
water
backed
by
my
uncle
she
soon
taught
me
to
be
as
much
afraid
of
those
green
spots
as
she
was
herself
i
had
learned
to
trust
her
thoroughly
i
took
my
way
to
the
stable
with
a
hug
and
a
kiss
to
martha
as
i
passed
her
in
the
kitchen
i
got
the
cowboy
to
saddle
zoe
fearing
i
might
not
persuade
one
of
the
big
men
on
such
a
night
and
i
was
not
quite
able
myself
to
tighten
the
girths
properly
she
had
not
been
out
all
day
and
when
i
mounted
she
danced
at
the
prospect
of
a
gallop
i
took
with
me
the
little
lantern
i
went
about
the
place
with
when
there
was
no
moon
and
with
this
alight
in
my
hand
we
darted
off
at
a
gallop
into
the
wet
blowing
night
what
i
was
going
for
i
did
not
know
beyond
being
with
my
uncle
so
far
was
i
from
any
fear
that
but
for
my
shadowy
uneasiness
about
him
i
should
have
been
filled
full
of
the
wild
joy
of
battle
with
the
elements
the
first
part
of
the
way
i
had
to
cling
to
the
saddle
not
otherwise
could
i
keep
my
seat
against
the
wind
which
blew
so
fiercely
on
me
sideways
that
it
threatened
to
blow
me
out
of
it
i
had
not
gone
far
before
the
saddle
began
to
turn
round
with
me
i
was
slipping
to
the
ground
i
pulled
up
dismounted
undid
the
girths
with
difficulty
set
the
saddle
straight
then
pulled
at
every
strap
with
all
my
might
it
was
to
no
purpose
i
could
not
get
another
hole
out
of
one
of
them
i
mounted
and
set
off
again
but
the
moment
a
stronger
blast
came
the
saddle
began
to
turn
then
i
thought
of
something
to
try
dismounting
once
more
i
got
up
on
the
off
side
the
wind
now
pushed
me
on
to
the
saddle
freeing
it
from
my
leverage
while
i
had
besides
the
use
of
my
legs
against
the
wind
so
that
we
got
on
bravely
my
zoe
and
i
but
alas
my
lantern
was
out
and
it
was
impossible
to
light
it
again
so
that
i
had
now
no
arrow
to
shoot
at
random
for
my
uncle
eye
before
long
we
reached
a
tolerable
which
led
across
the
waste
to
a
village
and
the
wind
being
now
behind
us
i
resumed
the
more
comfortable
seat
in
the
saddle
we
were
going
at
a
good
speed
and
had
ridden
as
i
judged
about
three
miles
when
there
came
a
great
flash
of
lightning
not
like
any
flash
i
had
ever
seen
before
it
was
neither
the
reflection
of
lightning
below
the
horizon
nor
the
sudden
zigzagged
blade
the
very
idea
of
force
without
weight
it
was
the
burst
of
a
torrent
of
fire
from
a
dark
cloud
like
water
sudden
from
a
mountain
heart
which
went
rushing
down
a
rugged
channel
as
if
the
cloud
were
indeed
a
mountain
and
the
fire
one
of
its
cataracts
its
endurance
was
momentary
but
its
moments
might
have
been
counted
for
it
lasted
appreciably
longer
than
an
ordinary
flash
revealing
to
my
eyes
what
remains
on
my
mind
clear
as
the
picture
of
some
neighbouring
tree
on
the
skin
of
one
slain
by
lightning
the
torrent
tumbled
down
the
cloud
and
vanished
but
left
with
me
the
vision
of
a
man
plainly
my
uncle
a
few
hundred
yards
from
me
on
a
gigantic
gray
horse
which
reared
high
with
fright
but
for
its
size
i
could
have
testified
before
a
magistrate
that
i
had
not
only
seen
that
horse
in
the
stable
as
my
pony
was
being
saddled
but
had
stroked
and
kissed
him
on
the
nose
i
conceived
at
once
that
his
apparent
size
was
an
illusion
caused
by
the
suddenness
and
keenness
of
the
light
and
that
my
uncle
had
come
home
before
i
had
well
reached
the
moor
and
had
ridden
out
after
me
with
a
wild
cry
of
delight
i
turned
at
once
to
leave
the
road
and
join
him
but
the
thunder
that
moment
burst
with
a
terrific
bellow
and
swallowed
my
cry
the
same
instant
however
came
through
it
from
the
other
side
the
voice
of
my
uncle
only
a
few
yards
away
stay
little
one
he
shouted
stay
where
you
are
i
will
be
with
you
in
a
i
obeyed
as
ever
and
always
without
a
thought
i
obeyed
the
slightest
word
of
my
uncle
zoe
and
i
stood
as
if
never
yet
parted
from
chaos
and
the
dark
for
zoe
too
loved
his
voice
the
wind
rose
suddenly
from
a
lull
to
a
great
roar
emptying
a
huge
cloudful
of
rain
upon
us
so
that
i
heard
no
sound
of
my
uncle
approach
but
presently
out
of
the
dark
an
arm
was
around
me
and
my
head
was
lying
on
my
uncle
bosom
then
the
dark
and
the
rain
seemed
the
natural
elements
for
love
and
confidence
but
uncle
i
murmured
full
of
wonder
which
had
had
no
time
to
take
shape
how
is
it
he
answered
in
a
whisper
that
seemed
to
dread
the
ear
of
the
wind
lest
it
should
hear
him
you
saw
did
you
i
saw
you
upon
death
away
there
in
the
middle
of
the
lightning
i
was
going
to
you
i
do
know
what
to
my
uncle
and
i
often
called
the
horse
by
his
english
name
neither
do
i
he
returned
with
a
strange
half
voice
as
if
he
were
choking
it
must
have
been
i
do
know
what
there
is
a
deep
bog
away
just
there
it
must
be
a
lake
by
now
yes
uncle
i
might
have
remembered
but
how
was
i
to
think
of
that
when
i
saw
you
there
on
dear
old
death
too
he
the
last
of
horses
to
get
into
a
bog
he
knows
his
own
weight
too
well
but
why
did
you
come
out
on
such
a
night
what
possessed
you
little
one
in
such
a
storm
i
begin
to
be
afraid
what
next
you
may
i
never
do
anything
now
that
i
think
you
would
mind
me
doing
i
answered
but
if
you
will
write
out
a
little
book
of
and
i
will
learn
it
by
no
no
he
returned
we
are
not
going
back
to
the
tables
of
the
law
you
have
a
better
law
written
in
your
heart
my
child
i
will
trust
to
but
tell
me
why
you
came
out
on
such
a
night
and
as
dark
as
just
because
it
was
such
a
night
uncle
and
you
were
out
in
it
i
answered
ai
i
your
own
little
girl
i
hope
you
ai
sorry
i
came
uncle
i
am
glad
and
i
should
like
ever
to
be
glad
at
what
made
you
what
are
you
glad
of
that
i
came
because
i
found
you
i
came
to
look
for
why
did
you
come
more
than
any
other
night
because
i
wanted
so
much
to
see
you
i
thought
i
might
be
of
use
to
you
are
always
of
use
to
me
but
why
did
you
think
of
it
just
i
do
i
am
older
than
i
was
last
night
i
replied
he
seemed
to
understand
me
and
asked
me
no
more
questions
all
the
time
we
had
been
standing
still
in
the
storm
he
took
zoe
head
and
turned
it
toward
home
the
dear
creature
set
out
with
slow
leisurely
step
heedless
apparently
of
storm
and
stable
she
knew
who
was
by
her
side
and
he
must
set
the
pace
as
we
went
my
uncle
seemed
lost
in
thought
and
no
wonder
for
how
could
the
sight
we
had
seen
be
accounted
for
or
what
might
it
indicate
many
were
the
strange
tales
i
had
read
and
my
conviction
was
that
the
vision
belonged
to
the
inexplicable
it
grew
upon
me
that
i
had
seen
my
uncle
double
that
he
should
see
his
own
double
would
not
in
itself
have
much
surprised
me
or
indeed
that
i
should
see
it
but
i
had
never
read
of
another
person
seeing
a
double
at
the
same
time
with
the
person
doubled
during
the
next
few
days
i
sought
hard
for
some
possible
explanation
of
what
had
occurred
but
could
find
nothing
parallel
to
it
within
the
scope
of
my
knowledge
i
tried
morgana
mirage
and
whatever
i
had
learned
of
recognized
illusion
but
in
vain
sought
satisfaction
or
anything
pointing
in
the
direction
of
satisfaction
i
was
compelled
to
leave
the
thing
alone
my
uncle
kept
silence
about
it
but
seemed
to
brood
more
than
usual
i
think
he
too
was
convinced
that
it
must
have
another
explanation
than
present
science
would
afford
him
once
i
ventured
to
ask
if
he
had
come
to
any
conclusion
with
a
sad
smile
he
answered
i
am
waiting
little
one
there
is
much
we
have
to
wait
for
where
would
be
the
good
of
having
your
mind
made
up
wrong
it
only
stands
in
the
way
of
getting
it
made
up
right
by
degrees
the
thing
went
into
the
distance
and
i
ceased
even
speculating
upon
it
but
one
little
fact
i
may
mention
ere
i
leave
it
that
just
as
i
was
reaching
a
state
of
quiet
mental
prorogation
i
suddenly
remembered
that
the
moment
after
the
flash
my
zoe
startled
as
she
was
gave
out
a
low
whinny
i
remembered
the
quiver
of
it
under
me
she
too
must
have
seen
her
master
double
chapter
ix
the
garden
i
remember
nothing
more
to
disturb
the
even
flow
of
my
life
till
i
was
nearly
seventeen
many
pleasant
things
had
come
and
gone
many
pleasant
things
kept
coming
and
going
i
had
studied
tolerably
well
at
least
my
uncle
showed
himself
pleased
with
the
progress
i
had
made
and
was
making
i
know
even
yet
a
good
deal
more
than
would
be
required
for
one
of
these
modern
degrees
feminine
i
had
besides
read
more
of
the
older
literature
of
my
country
than
any
one
i
have
met
except
my
uncle
i
had
also
this
advantage
over
most
students
that
my
knowledge
was
gained
without
the
slightest
prick
of
the
spur
of
emulation
purely
in
following
the
same
delight
in
myself
that
shone
radiant
in
the
eyes
of
my
uncle
as
he
read
with
me
i
had
this
advantage
also
over
many
that
perhaps
from
impression
of
the
higher
mind
i
saw
and
learned
a
thing
not
merely
as
a
fact
whose
glory
lay
in
the
mystery
of
its
undeveloped
harmonics
but
as
the
harbinger
of
an
unknown
advent
for
as
long
as
i
can
remember
my
heart
was
given
to
expectation
was
tuned
to
long
waiting
i
constantly
felt
felt
without
thinking
that
something
was
coming
i
feel
it
now
were
i
young
i
dared
not
say
so
how
could
i
compassed
about
with
so
great
a
cloud
of
witnesses
to
the
do
i
not
see
their
superior
smile
as
with
voices
sweetly
acidulous
they
quote
in
reply
love
is
well
on
the
way
he
be
here
or
at
latest
the
end
of
the
week
too
soon
you
will
find
him
and
the
sorrow
behind
him
you
will
not
go
out
to
seek
would
they
not
tell
me
that
such
expectation
was
but
the
shadow
of
the
cloud
called
love
hanging
no
bigger
than
a
man
hand
on
the
far
horizon
but
fraught
with
storm
for
mind
and
soul
which
when
it
withdrew
would
carry
with
it
the
glow
and
the
glory
and
the
hope
of
life
being
at
best
but
the
mirage
of
an
unattainable
paradise
therefore
direst
of
deceptions
little
do
such
suspect
that
their
own
behaviour
has
withered
their
faith
and
their
unbelief
dried
up
their
life
they
can
now
no
more
believe
in
what
they
once
felt
than
a
cloud
can
believe
in
the
rainbow
it
once
bore
on
its
bosom
but
i
am
old
therefore
dare
to
say
that
i
expect
more
and
better
and
higher
and
lovelier
things
than
i
have
ever
had
i
am
not
going
home
to
god
to
say
father
i
have
imagined
more
beautiful
things
than
thou
art
able
to
make
true
they
were
so
good
that
thou
thyself
art
either
not
good
enough
to
will
them
or
not
strong
enough
to
make
them
thou
couldst
but
make
thy
creature
dream
of
them
because
thou
canst
but
dream
of
them
nay
nay
in
the
faith
of
him
to
whom
the
father
shows
all
things
he
does
i
expect
lovelier
gifts
than
i
ever
have
been
ever
shall
be
able
to
dream
of
asleep
or
imagine
awake
i
was
now
approaching
the
verge
of
what
lay
beyond
it
i
could
ill
descry
though
surely
a
vague
power
of
undeveloped
prophecy
dwells
in
every
created
thing
even
in
the
bird
ere
he
chips
his
shell
should
i
dare
or
could
i
endure
to
write
of
what
lies
now
to
my
hand
if
i
did
not
believe
that
not
our
worst
but
our
best
moments
not
our
low
but
our
lofty
moods
not
our
times
logical
and
scientific
but
our
times
instinctive
and
imaginative
are
those
in
which
we
perceive
the
truth
in
them
we
behold
it
with
a
beholding
which
is
one
with
believing
and
though
nothing
can
bring
back
the
hour
of
splendour
in
the
grass
of
glory
in
the
flower
could
not
wordsworth
and
can
not
we
call
up
the
vision
of
that
hour
and
has
not
its
memory
almost
or
even
altogether
the
potency
of
its
presence
is
not
the
very
thought
of
any
certain
flower
enough
to
make
me
believe
in
that
flower
believe
it
to
mean
all
it
ever
seemed
to
mean
that
eyes
may
never
more
rest
upon
it
with
the
old
delight
means
little
and
matters
nothing
i
have
other
eyes
and
shall
have
yet
others
if
i
thought
as
so
many
have
degraded
themselves
to
think
that
the
glory
of
things
in
the
morning
of
love
was
a
glamour
cast
upon
the
world
no
outshine
of
indwelling
radiance
should
i
care
to
breathe
one
day
more
the
air
of
this
or
of
any
world
nay
nay
but
there
dwells
in
everything
the
father
hath
made
the
fire
of
the
burning
bush
as
at
home
in
his
son
dwelt
the
glory
that
set
free
broke
out
from
him
on
the
mount
of
his
transfiguration
the
vision
of
things
that
floods
the
gaze
of
the
youth
when
first
he
lives
in
the
marvel
of
loving
and
being
loved
by
a
woman
is
the
true
vision
and
the
more
likely
to
be
the
true
one
that
when
he
gives
way
to
selfishness
he
loses
faith
in
the
vision
and
sinks
back
into
the
commonplace
unfaith
of
the
beggarly
world
a
disappointed
sneering
worshipper
of
power
and
money
with
this
remnant
of
the
light
yet
in
him
that
he
grumbles
at
the
gloom
its
departure
has
left
behind
he
confesses
by
his
soreness
that
the
illusion
ought
to
have
been
true
he
seldom
confesses
that
he
loved
himself
more
than
the
woman
and
so
lost
her
he
lays
the
blame
on
god
on
the
woman
on
the
soullessness
of
the
universe
anywhere
but
on
the
one
being
in
which
he
is
interested
enough
to
be
sure
it
exists
his
own
precious
greedy
vulgar
self
would
i
dare
to
write
of
love
if
i
did
not
believe
it
a
true
that
is
an
eternal
thing
it
was
a
summer
of
exceptional
splendour
in
which
my
eyes
were
opened
to
the
glory
of
the
sum
of
it
was
not
so
hot
of
the
sun
as
summers
i
have
known
but
there
were
so
many
gentle
and
loving
winds
about
with
never
point
or
in
them
that
it
seemed
all
the
housework
of
the
universe
was
being
done
by
ladies
then
the
way
the
odours
went
and
came
on
those
sweet
winds
and
the
way
the
twilight
fell
asleep
into
the
dark
and
the
way
the
sun
rushed
up
in
the
morning
as
if
he
cried
like
a
boy
here
i
am
the
father
has
sent
me
is
it
jolly
i
saw
more
that
year
than
any
year
before
or
since
and
the
grass
was
so
thick
and
soft
there
must
be
grass
in
heaven
and
the
roses
both
wild
and
tame
that
grew
together
in
the
wilderness
i
think
you
would
like
to
hear
about
the
wilderness
when
i
grew
to
notice
and
think
and
put
things
together
i
began
to
wonder
how
the
wilderness
came
there
i
could
understand
that
the
solemn
garden
with
its
great
and
alleys
and
its
oddly
cut
was
a
survival
of
the
stately
old
gardens
haunted
by
ruffs
and
farthingales
but
the
wilderness
looked
so
much
younger
that
i
was
perplexed
with
it
especially
as
i
saw
nothing
like
it
anywhere
else
i
asked
my
uncle
about
it
and
he
explained
that
it
was
indeed
after
an
old
fashion
but
that
he
had
himself
made
the
wilderness
mostly
with
his
own
hands
when
he
was
young
this
surprised
me
for
i
had
never
seen
him
touch
a
spade
and
hardly
ever
saw
him
in
the
garden
when
i
did
i
always
felt
as
if
something
was
going
to
happen
he
said
he
had
in
it
tried
to
copy
the
wilderness
laid
out
by
lord
alban
in
his
essays
i
found
the
volume
and
soon
came
upon
the
essay
on
gardens
the
passage
concerning
the
wilderness
gave
me
and
still
gives
me
so
much
delight
that
i
will
transplant
it
like
a
into
this
wilderness
of
mine
hoping
it
will
give
like
pleasure
to
my
reader
for
the
heath
which
was
the
third
part
of
our
plot
i
wish
it
to
be
framed
as
much
as
may
be
to
a
natural
wildness
trees
i
would
have
none
in
it
but
some
thickets
made
only
of
sweetbriar
and
honnysuckle
and
some
wild
vine
amongst
and
the
ground
set
with
violets
strawberries
and
primroses
for
these
are
sweet
and
prosper
in
the
shade
and
these
to
be
in
the
heath
here
and
there
not
in
any
order
i
like
also
little
heapes
in
the
nature
of
such
as
are
in
wild
heaths
to
be
set
some
with
wild
thyme
some
with
pincks
some
with
germander
that
gives
a
good
flower
to
the
eye
some
with
periwinkle
some
with
violets
some
with
strawberries
some
with
couslips
some
with
daisies
some
with
red
roses
some
with
lilium
convallium
some
with
red
some
with
and
the
like
low
flowers
being
withall
sweet
and
sightly
part
of
which
heapes
to
be
with
standards
of
little
bushes
prickt
upon
their
top
and
part
without
the
standards
to
be
roses
juniper
holly
beareberries
but
here
and
there
because
of
the
smell
of
their
blossom
red
currans
gooseberries
rosemary
bayes
sweetbriar
and
such
like
but
these
standards
to
be
kept
with
cutting
that
they
grow
not
out
of
just
such
in
all
but
the
gooseberries
and
currants
was
the
wilderness
of
our
garden
you
came
on
it
by
a
sudden
labyrinthine
twist
at
the
end
of
a
narrow
alley
of
yew
and
a
sudden
door
in
the
high
wall
my
uncle
said
he
liked
well
to
see
roses
in
the
but
not
gooseberries
in
the
especially
a
wild
wherein
lies
the
difference
i
never
quite
made
out
but
i
feel
a
difference
my
main
delight
in
the
wilderness
was
to
see
the
roses
among
the
heather
particularly
the
wild
roses
when
i
was
grown
up
the
wilderness
always
affected
me
like
one
of
blake
or
one
of
yet
wilder
lyrics
to
make
it
my
uncle
had
taken
in
a
part
of
the
heath
which
came
close
up
to
the
garden
leaving
plenty
of
the
heather
and
ling
the
protecting
fence
enclosed
a
good
bit
of
the
heath
just
as
it
was
so
that
the
wilderness
melted
away
into
the
heath
and
into
the
wide
moor
the
fence
though
contrived
so
as
to
be
difficult
to
cross
being
so
low
that
one
had
to
look
for
it
everywhere
the
inner
garden
was
surrounded
with
brick
walls
and
hedges
of
yew
within
them
but
immediately
behind
the
house
the
wall
to
the
lane
was
not
very
high
chapter
x
once
more
a
secret
one
day
in
june
i
had
gone
into
the
garden
about
one
whether
with
or
without
object
i
forget
i
had
just
seen
my
uncle
start
for
wittenage
hearing
a
horse
hoofs
in
the
lane
that
ran
along
the
outside
of
the
wall
i
looked
up
the
same
moment
the
horse
stopped
and
the
face
of
his
rider
appeared
over
the
wall
between
two
stems
of
yew
and
two
great
flowers
of
purple
lilac
in
shape
like
two
perfect
bunches
of
swarming
bees
it
was
the
face
of
a
youth
of
eighteen
and
beautiful
with
a
right
manly
beauty
the
moment
i
looked
on
this
face
i
fell
into
a
sort
of
trance
that
is
i
entered
for
a
moment
some
condition
of
existence
beyond
the
ramparts
of
what
commonly
we
call
life
love
at
first
sight
it
was
that
initiated
the
strange
experience
but
understand
me
real
as
what
immediately
followed
was
to
the
consciousness
there
was
no
actual
fact
in
it
i
stood
gazing
my
eyes
seemed
drawn
and
drawing
my
person
toward
the
vision
isolate
over
the
was
the
face
the
rest
of
the
man
and
all
the
horse
were
hidden
behind
it
betwixt
the
yew
stems
and
the
two
great
lilac
flowers
how
heart
and
brain
are
yet
filled
with
the
old
scent
of
them
my
face
my
mouth
my
lips
met
his
i
grew
blind
as
with
all
my
heart
i
kissed
him
then
came
a
flash
of
icy
terror
and
a
shudder
which
it
frights
me
even
now
to
recall
instantly
i
knew
that
but
a
moment
had
passed
and
that
i
had
not
moved
an
inch
from
the
spot
where
first
my
eyes
met
his
but
my
eyes
yet
rested
on
his
i
could
not
draw
them
away
i
could
not
free
myself
helplessness
was
growing
agony
his
voice
broke
the
spell
he
lifted
his
and
begged
me
to
tell
him
the
way
to
the
next
village
my
returned
and
the
joy
of
its
restoration
drove
from
me
any
lingering
embarrassment
i
went
forward
and
without
a
faltering
tone
i
believe
gave
him
detailed
directions
he
told
me
afterwards
that
himself
in
a
state
of
bewildered
surprise
he
thought
me
the
coolest
young
person
he
had
ever
had
the
fortune
to
meet
why
should
one
be
pleased
to
know
that
she
looked
quite
different
from
what
she
felt
there
is
something
wrong
there
surely
i
acknowledge
the
something
wrong
but
do
not
understand
it
he
lifted
his
cap
again
and
rode
away
i
stood
still
at
the
foot
of
the
and
from
a
vapour
condensed
not
to
a
stone
but
to
a
world
in
which
a
new
flora
was
about
to
be
developed
if
no
new
spiritual
sense
was
awakened
in
me
at
least
i
was
aware
of
a
new
consciousness
i
had
never
been
to
myself
what
i
was
now
terror
again
seized
me
the
face
might
once
more
look
over
the
wall
and
find
me
where
it
had
left
me
i
turned
and
went
slowly
away
from
the
house
gravitating
to
the
darkest
part
of
the
garden
what
has
come
to
me
i
said
that
i
seek
the
darkness
is
this
another
secret
am
i
in
the
grasp
of
a
new
enemy
and
with
that
came
the
whirlwind
of
perplexity
must
i
go
the
first
moment
i
knew
i
could
find
him
and
tell
my
uncle
what
had
happened
and
how
i
felt
or
must
i
have
and
hold
and
cherish
in
silent
heart
a
thing
so
wondrous
so
precious
so
absorbing
had
i
not
deliberately
promised
of
my
own
will
and
at
my
own
instance
never
again
to
have
a
secret
from
him
was
this
a
secret
was
it
not
a
secret
the
storm
was
up
and
went
on
the
wonder
is
that
in
the
fire
of
the
new
torment
i
did
not
come
to
loathe
the
very
thought
of
the
young
man
which
would
have
delivered
me
if
not
from
the
necessity
of
confession
yet
from
the
main
difficulty
in
confessing
i
said
to
myself
that
the
old
secret
was
of
a
wrong
done
to
my
uncle
that
what
had
made
me
miserable
then
was
a
bad
secret
the
perception
of
this
difference
gave
me
comfort
for
a
time
but
not
for
long
the
fact
remained
that
i
knew
something
concerning
myself
which
my
best
friend
did
not
know
it
was
and
i
could
not
prevent
it
from
being
a
barrier
between
us
yet
what
was
it
i
was
concealing
from
him
what
had
i
to
tell
him
how
was
i
to
represent
a
thing
of
which
i
knew
neither
the
name
nor
the
nature
a
thing
i
could
not
describe
could
i
confess
what
i
did
not
understand
the
thing
might
be
what
in
the
tales
i
had
read
was
called
love
but
i
did
not
know
that
it
was
it
might
be
something
new
peculiar
to
myself
something
for
which
there
was
no
word
in
the
language
how
was
i
to
tell
i
saw
plainly
that
if
i
tried
to
convey
my
new
experience
i
should
not
get
beyond
the
statement
that
i
had
a
new
experience
it
did
not
occur
to
me
that
the
thing
might
be
so
well
known
that
a
mere
hint
of
the
feelings
concerned
would
enable
any
older
person
to
classify
the
consciousness
i
said
to
myself
i
should
merely
perplex
my
uncle
and
in
truth
i
believe
that
love
in
every
mind
in
which
it
arises
will
vary
in
colour
and
form
will
always
partake
of
that
mind
individual
isolation
in
difference
this
however
is
nothing
to
the
present
point
comfort
myself
as
i
might
that
the
impossible
was
required
of
no
one
and
granted
that
the
thing
was
impossible
it
was
none
the
less
a
cause
of
misery
a
present
disaster
i
was
aware
and
soon
my
uncle
would
be
aware
of
an
impenetrable
something
separating
us
i
felt
that
we
had
already
begun
to
grow
strange
to
each
other
and
the
feeling
lay
like
death
at
my
heart
our
lessons
together
were
still
going
on
that
i
was
no
longer
a
child
had
made
only
the
difference
that
progress
must
make
and
i
had
no
thought
that
they
would
not
thus
go
on
always
they
were
never
for
a
moment
irksome
to
me
i
might
be
tired
by
them
but
never
of
them
we
were
regularly
at
work
together
by
seven
and
after
half
an
hour
for
breakfast
resumed
work
at
eleven
our
lessons
were
over
but
although
the
day
was
then
clear
of
the
imperative
much
the
greater
part
of
it
was
in
general
passed
in
each
other
company
we
might
not
speak
a
word
but
we
would
be
hours
together
in
the
study
we
might
not
speak
a
word
but
we
would
be
hours
together
on
horseback
for
this
day
then
our
lessons
were
over
and
my
uncle
was
from
home
this
was
an
indisputable
relief
yet
the
fact
that
it
was
so
pained
me
keenly
for
i
recognized
in
it
the
first
of
the
schism
how
i
got
through
the
day
i
can
not
tell
i
was
in
a
dream
not
all
a
dream
of
delight
haunted
with
the
face
i
had
seen
and
living
in
the
new
consciousness
it
had
waked
in
me
i
spent
most
of
it
in
the
garden
now
in
the
glooms
of
the
and
now
in
the
smiling
wilderness
it
was
odd
however
that
although
i
was
not
to
be
in
my
uncle
room
at
any
time
but
that
of
lessons
all
the
morning
i
had
a
feeling
as
if
i
ought
to
be
there
while
yet
glad
that
my
uncle
was
not
there
it
was
late
before
he
returned
and
i
went
to
bed
perhaps
i
retired
so
soon
that
i
might
not
have
to
look
into
his
eyes
usually
i
sat
now
until
he
came
home
i
was
long
in
getting
to
sleep
and
then
i
dreamed
i
thought
i
was
out
in
the
storm
and
the
flash
came
which
revealed
the
horse
and
his
rider
but
they
were
both
different
the
horse
in
the
dream
was
black
as
coal
as
if
carved
out
of
the
night
itself
and
the
man
upon
him
was
the
beautiful
stranger
whose
horse
i
had
not
seen
for
the
the
darkness
fell
and
the
voice
of
my
uncle
called
to
me
i
waited
for
him
in
the
storm
with
a
troubled
heart
for
i
knew
he
had
not
seen
that
vision
and
i
could
no
more
tell
him
of
it
than
could
christabel
tell
her
father
what
she
had
seen
after
she
lay
down
i
woke
but
my
waking
was
no
relief
chapter
xi
the
mole
burrows
i
slept
again
after
my
dream
and
do
not
know
whether
he
came
into
my
room
as
he
generally
did
when
he
had
not
said
to
me
of
course
i
woke
unhappy
and
the
had
lost
something
of
its
natural
glow
its
lovely
freshness
it
was
not
this
time
a
thing
of
the
creating
word
i
dawdled
with
my
dressing
the
face
kept
coming
and
brought
me
no
peace
yet
brought
me
something
for
which
it
seemed
worth
while
even
to
lose
my
peace
but
i
did
not
know
then
and
do
not
yet
know
what
the
loss
of
peace
actually
means
i
only
know
that
it
must
be
something
far
more
terrible
than
anything
i
have
ever
known
i
remained
so
far
true
to
my
uncle
however
that
not
even
for
what
the
face
seemed
to
promise
me
would
i
have
consented
to
cause
him
trouble
for
what
i
saw
in
the
face
i
would
do
anything
i
thought
except
that
i
went
to
him
at
the
usual
hour
determined
that
nothing
should
distract
me
from
my
work
that
he
should
perceive
no
difference
in
me
i
was
not
at
the
moment
awake
to
the
fact
that
here
again
were
love
and
deception
hand
in
hand
but
another
love
than
mine
was
there
my
uncle
loved
me
immeasurably
more
than
i
yet
loved
that
heavenly
vision
true
love
is
as
the
eagle
and
my
uncle
love
was
love
true
therefore
he
saw
what
i
sought
to
hide
it
is
only
the
shadow
of
love
generally
a
grotesque
ugly
thing
like
so
many
other
shadows
that
is
blind
either
to
the
troubles
or
the
faults
of
the
shadow
it
seems
to
love
the
moment
our
eyes
met
i
saw
that
he
saw
something
in
mine
that
was
not
there
when
last
we
parted
but
he
said
nothing
and
we
sat
down
to
our
lessons
every
now
and
then
as
they
proceeded
however
i
felt
rather
than
saw
his
eyes
rest
on
me
for
a
moment
questioning
i
had
never
known
them
rest
on
me
so
before
plainly
he
was
aware
of
some
change
and
could
there
be
anything
different
in
the
relation
of
two
who
so
long
had
loved
each
other
without
something
being
less
well
and
good
than
before
nor
was
it
indeed
wonderful
he
should
see
a
difference
for
with
all
the
might
of
my
resolve
to
do
even
better
than
usual
i
would
now
and
then
find
myself
unconscious
of
what
either
of
us
had
last
been
saying
the
face
had
come
yet
again
and
driven
everything
from
its
presence
i
grew
angry
not
with
the
youth
but
with
his
face
for
appearing
so
often
when
i
did
not
invite
it
once
i
caught
myself
on
the
verge
of
crying
out
ca
you
wait
i
will
come
presently
and
my
uncle
looked
up
as
if
i
had
spoken
perhaps
he
had
as
good
as
heard
the
words
he
possessed
what
almost
seemed
a
supernatural
faculty
of
divining
the
thought
of
another
not
i
was
sure
by
any
effort
to
perceive
it
but
by
involuntary
intuition
he
uttered
no
inquiring
word
but
a
light
sigh
escaped
him
which
all
but
made
me
burst
into
tears
i
was
on
one
side
of
a
widening
gulf
and
he
on
the
other
our
lessons
ended
he
rose
immediately
and
left
the
room
five
minutes
passed
and
then
came
the
clatter
of
his
horse
feet
on
the
stones
of
the
yard
a
moment
more
and
i
heard
him
ride
away
at
a
quick
trot
i
burst
into
tears
where
i
still
sat
beside
my
uncle
empty
chair
i
was
weary
like
one
in
a
dream
searching
in
vain
for
a
spot
whereupon
to
set
down
her
burden
there
was
no
one
but
my
uncle
to
whom
i
could
tell
any
trouble
and
the
trouble
i
could
not
have
told
him
had
hitherto
been
unimaginable
from
this
my
reader
may
judge
what
a
trouble
it
was
that
i
could
not
tell
him
my
trouble
i
was
a
traitor
to
my
only
friend
had
i
begun
to
love
him
less
had
i
begun
to
turn
away
from
him
i
dared
not
believe
it
that
would
have
been
to
give
eternity
to
my
misery
but
it
might
be
that
at
heart
i
was
a
bad
treacherous
girl
i
had
again
a
secret
from
him
i
was
not
him
i
went
into
the
garden
the
day
was
sultry
and
oppressive
coolness
or
comfort
was
nowhere
i
sought
the
shadow
of
the
live
there
was
shelter
in
the
shadow
but
it
oppressed
the
lungs
while
it
comforted
the
eyes
not
a
breath
of
wind
breathed
the
atmosphere
seemed
to
have
lost
its
i
went
out
into
the
wilderness
there
the
air
was
filled
and
heaped
with
the
odours
of
the
heavenly
plants
that
crowded
its
humble
floor
but
they
gave
me
no
welcome
between
two
bushes
that
flamed
out
roses
i
lay
down
and
the
heather
and
the
closed
above
me
my
mind
was
in
such
a
confusion
of
pain
and
pleasure
not
without
a
hope
of
deliverance
somewhere
in
its
clouded
sky
that
i
could
think
no
more
and
fell
asleep
i
imagine
that
had
i
never
again
seen
the
young
man
i
should
not
have
suffered
i
think
that
by
slow
natural
degrees
his
phantasmal
presence
would
have
ceased
to
haunt
me
and
gradually
i
should
have
returned
to
my
former
condition
i
do
not
mean
i
should
have
forgotten
him
but
neither
should
i
have
been
troubled
when
i
thought
of
him
i
know
i
should
never
have
regretted
having
seen
him
in
that
i
had
nothing
to
blame
myself
for
and
should
have
felt
not
that
a
glory
had
passed
away
from
the
earth
but
that
i
had
had
a
vision
of
bliss
what
it
was
i
should
not
have
had
the
power
to
recall
but
it
would
have
left
with
me
the
faith
that
i
had
beheld
something
too
ethereal
for
my
memory
to
store
i
should
have
consoled
myself
both
with
the
dream
and
with
the
conviction
that
i
should
not
dream
it
again
the
peaceful
sense
of
recovered
nearness
to
my
uncle
would
have
been
far
more
precious
than
the
dream
the
sudden
fire
of
transfiguration
that
had
for
a
moment
flamed
out
of
the
all
and
straightway
withdrawn
would
have
become
a
memory
only
but
none
the
less
would
that
enlargement
of
the
child
way
of
seeing
things
have
remained
with
me
i
do
not
think
that
would
ever
have
left
me
it
is
the
care
of
the
prudent
wise
that
bleaches
the
grass
and
is
as
the
fumes
of
sulphur
to
the
red
rose
of
life
outwearied
with
inward
conflict
i
slept
a
dreamless
sleep
chapter
xii
a
letter
a
cool
soft
breeze
went
through
the
curtains
of
my
couch
and
i
awoke
the
blooms
of
the
and
the
were
waving
together
over
my
head
the
sigh
of
the
wind
had
breathed
itself
out
over
the
far
heath
and
ere
it
died
in
my
fairy
forest
of
lowly
plants
and
bushes
had
found
and
fanned
the
cheeks
that
lay
down
hot
and
athirst
for
air
it
gave
me
new
life
and
i
rose
refreshed
something
fluttered
to
the
ground
i
thought
it
was
a
leaf
from
a
white
rose
above
me
but
i
looked
at
my
feet
lay
a
piece
of
paper
i
took
it
up
it
had
been
folded
very
hastily
and
had
no
address
but
who
could
have
a
better
right
to
unfold
it
than
i
it
might
be
nothing
it
might
be
a
letter
should
i
open
it
should
i
not
rather
seize
the
opportunity
of
setting
things
right
between
my
heart
and
my
uncle
by
taking
it
to
him
unopened
only
if
it
were
indeed
i
dared
hardly
even
in
thought
complete
the
supposition
might
it
not
be
a
wrong
to
the
youth
might
not
the
paper
contain
a
confidence
might
it
not
be
the
messenger
of
a
heart
that
trusted
me
before
even
it
knew
my
name
would
i
inaugurate
our
acquaintance
with
an
act
of
treachery
or
at
least
distrust
right
or
wrong
thus
my
heart
reasoned
and
to
its
reasoning
i
gave
heed
it
will
i
said
be
time
enough
to
resolve
when
i
know
concerning
what
this
i
now
see
was
juggling
for
the
question
was
whether
i
should
be
open
with
my
uncle
or
not
it
might
be
i
said
to
myself
that
the
moment
i
knew
the
contents
of
the
paper
i
should
reproach
myself
that
i
had
not
read
it
at
once
i
sat
down
on
a
bush
of
heather
and
unfolded
it
this
is
what
i
found
written
with
a
pencil
i
am
the
man
to
whom
you
talked
so
kindly
over
your
garden
wall
yesterday
i
fear
you
may
think
me
presuming
and
impertinent
presuming
i
may
be
but
impertinent
surely
not
if
i
were
would
not
my
heart
tell
me
so
seeing
it
is
all
on
your
side
my
name
is
john
day
i
do
not
yet
know
yours
i
have
not
dared
to
inquire
after
it
lest
i
should
hear
of
some
impassable
gulf
between
us
the
fear
of
such
a
gulf
haunts
me
i
can
think
of
nothing
but
the
face
i
saw
over
the
wall
through
the
clusters
of
lilac
the
wall
seems
to
keep
rising
and
rising
as
if
it
would
hide
you
for
ever
is
it
wrong
to
think
thus
of
you
without
your
leave
if
one
may
not
love
the
loveliest
then
is
the
world
but
a
hung
in
the
great
heaven
to
catch
and
ruin
souls
if
i
am
writing
nonsense
i
can
not
tell
whether
i
am
or
not
it
is
because
my
wits
wander
with
my
eyes
to
gaze
at
you
through
the
leaves
of
the
wild
white
rose
under
which
you
are
asleep
loveliest
of
faces
may
no
gentlest
wind
of
thought
ripple
thy
perfect
calm
until
i
have
said
what
i
must
and
laid
it
where
she
will
find
it
i
live
at
rising
the
over
the
heath
i
am
the
son
of
lady
cairnedge
by
a
former
marriage
i
am
twenty
years
of
age
and
have
just
ended
my
last
term
at
oxford
may
i
come
and
see
you
if
you
will
not
see
me
why
then
did
you
walk
into
my
quiet
house
and
turn
everything
upside
down
i
shall
come
in
the
dusk
and
wait
in
the
heather
outside
the
fence
if
you
come
thank
god
if
you
do
not
i
shall
believe
you
could
not
and
come
again
and
again
and
again
till
hope
is
dead
but
i
warn
you
i
am
a
terrible
hoper
it
would
startle
perhaps
offend
you
to
wake
and
see
me
but
i
can
not
bear
to
leave
you
asleep
something
might
come
too
near
you
i
will
write
until
you
move
and
then
make
haste
to
go
my
heart
swells
with
words
too
shy
to
go
out
surely
a
will
has
brought
us
together
i
believe
in
fate
never
in
chance
when
we
see
each
other
again
will
the
wall
be
down
between
us
or
shall
i
know
it
will
part
us
all
our
mortal
lives
longer
than
that
it
can
not
if
you
say
to
me
must
not
see
you
but
i
will
think
of
you
not
one
shall
ever
know
i
have
other
than
a
light
heart
even
now
i
begin
the
endeavour
to
be
such
that
when
we
meet
at
last
as
meet
we
must
you
shall
not
say
this
the
man
alas
who
dared
to
love
me
i
love
you
as
one
might
love
a
who
at
the
merest
breath
going
to
fashion
a
word
unfit
would
spread
her
wings
and
soar
do
not
i
pray
you
fear
to
let
me
come
there
are
things
that
must
be
done
in
faith
else
they
never
have
being
let
this
be
one
of
you
as
i
came
to
these
last
words
hurriedly
written
i
heard
behind
me
over
the
height
the
quick
gallop
of
a
horse
and
knew
the
piece
of
firm
turf
he
was
crossing
the
same
moment
i
was
there
in
spirit
and
the
imagination
was
almost
vision
i
saw
him
speeding
away
to
come
again
said
my
heart
solemn
with
gladness
was
the
house
to
which
the
lady
took
me
that
dread
night
when
first
i
knew
what
it
was
to
be
alone
in
darkness
and
silence
and
space
was
that
lady
his
mother
had
she
rescued
me
for
her
son
i
was
not
willing
to
believe
it
though
i
had
never
actually
seen
her
the
way
was
mostly
dark
and
during
the
latter
portion
of
it
i
was
much
too
weary
to
look
up
where
she
sat
on
her
great
horse
i
had
never
to
my
knowledge
heard
who
lived
at
rising
i
was
not
born
inquisitive
and
there
were
miles
between
us
i
sat
still
without
impulse
to
move
a
finger
i
lived
essentially
now
i
knew
what
had
come
to
me
it
was
no
merely
idiosyncratic
experience
for
the
youth
had
the
same
it
was
love
how
otherwise
could
we
thus
be
drawn
together
from
both
sides
verily
it
seemed
also
good
enough
to
be
that
wondrous
thing
ever
on
the
lips
of
poets
and
magicians
was
it
not
far
beyond
any
notion
of
it
their
words
had
given
me
but
my
uncle
there
lay
bitterness
was
i
indeed
false
to
him
that
now
the
thought
of
him
was
a
pain
had
i
begun
a
new
life
apart
from
him
to
tell
him
would
perhaps
check
the
terrible
separation
but
how
was
i
to
tell
him
for
the
first
time
i
knew
that
i
had
no
mother
would
mother
be
my
mother
too
and
help
me
but
from
no
woman
save
my
own
mother
hardly
even
from
her
would
i
ask
mediation
with
the
uncle
i
had
loved
and
trusted
all
my
life
and
with
my
whole
heart
i
had
never
known
father
or
mother
save
as
he
had
been
father
and
mother
and
everybody
to
me
what
was
i
to
do
gladly
would
i
have
hurried
to
some
desert
place
and
there
waited
for
the
light
i
needed
that
i
was
no
longer
in
any
uncertainty
as
to
the
word
that
described
my
condition
did
not
i
found
make
it
easy
to
use
the
word
perhaps
i
argued
struggling
in
the
toils
of
my
new
liberty
my
uncle
knows
nothing
of
this
kind
of
love
and
would
be
unable
to
understand
me
suppose
i
confessed
to
him
what
i
felt
toward
a
man
i
had
spoken
to
but
once
and
then
only
to
tell
him
the
way
to
dumbleton
would
he
not
think
me
out
of
my
mind
at
length
i
bethought
me
that
so
long
as
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
was
not
required
to
do
anything
i
must
wait
till
i
did
know
what
to
do
but
with
the
thought
came
suffering
enough
to
be
the
wages
of
any
sin
that
so
far
as
i
knew
i
had
ever
committed
for
the
conviction
awoke
that
already
the
love
that
had
hitherto
been
the
chief
joy
of
my
being
had
begun
to
pale
and
fade
was
it
possible
i
was
ceasing
to
love
my
uncle
what
could
any
love
be
worth
if
mine
should
fail
my
uncle
love
itself
must
be
a
mockery
and
life
but
a
ceaseless
sliding
down
to
the
death
of
indifference
even
if
i
never
ceased
to
love
him
it
was
just
as
bad
to
love
him
less
had
he
not
been
everything
to
me
and
this
man
what
had
he
ever
done
for
me
doubtless
we
are
to
love
even
our
enemies
but
are
we
to
love
them
as
tenderly
as
we
love
our
friends
or
are
we
to
love
the
friend
of
yesterday
of
whom
we
know
nothing
though
we
may
believe
everything
as
we
love
those
who
have
taken
all
the
trouble
to
make
true
men
and
women
of
us
what
can
be
the
matter
with
my
soul
i
said
can
that
soul
be
right
made
in
which
one
love
begins
to
wither
the
moment
another
begins
to
grow
if
i
be
so
made
i
can
not
help
being
worthless
it
was
then
first
i
think
that
i
received
a
notion
anything
like
a
true
notion
that
is
of
my
need
of
a
god
whence
afterward
i
came
to
see
the
one
need
of
the
whole
race
of
course
not
being
able
to
make
ourselves
it
needed
a
god
to
make
us
but
that
making
were
a
small
thing
indeed
if
he
left
us
so
unfinished
that
we
could
come
to
nothing
right
if
he
left
us
so
that
we
could
think
or
do
or
be
nothing
right
if
our
souls
were
created
so
puny
for
instance
that
there
was
not
room
in
them
to
love
as
they
could
not
help
loving
without
ceasing
to
love
where
they
were
bound
by
every
obligation
to
love
right
heartily
and
more
and
more
deeply
but
had
i
not
been
growing
all
the
time
i
had
been
in
the
world
there
must
then
be
the
possibility
of
growing
still
if
there
was
not
room
in
me
there
must
be
room
in
god
for
me
to
become
larger
the
room
in
god
must
be
made
room
in
me
god
had
not
done
making
me
in
fact
and
i
sorely
needed
him
to
go
on
making
me
i
sorely
needed
to
be
made
out
what
if
this
new
joy
and
this
new
terror
had
come
had
been
sent
in
order
to
make
me
grow
at
least
the
doors
were
open
i
could
go
out
and
forsake
myself
if
a
living
power
had
caused
me
and
certainly
i
did
not
cause
myself
then
that
living
power
knew
all
about
me
knew
every
smallness
that
distressed
me
where
should
i
find
him
he
could
not
be
so
far
that
the
misery
of
one
of
his
own
children
could
not
reach
him
i
turned
my
face
into
the
grass
and
prayed
as
i
had
never
prayed
before
i
had
always
gone
to
church
and
made
the
responses
attentively
while
i
knew
that
was
not
praying
and
tried
to
pray
better
than
that
but
now
i
was
really
asking
from
god
something
i
sorely
wanted
father
in
heaven
i
said
i
am
so
miserable
please
help
me
i
rose
went
into
the
house
and
up
to
the
study
took
a
sock
i
was
knitting
for
my
uncle
and
sat
down
to
wait
what
would
come
i
could
think
no
more
i
could
only
wait
chapter
xiii
old
love
and
new
while
i
waited
as
nearly
a
log
under
the
weariness
of
spiritual
unrest
as
a
girl
could
well
be
the
door
opened
very
seldom
did
that
door
open
to
any
one
but
my
uncle
or
myself
he
would
let
no
one
but
me
touch
his
books
or
even
dust
the
room
i
jumped
from
the
chest
where
i
sat
it
was
only
martha
moon
how
you
startled
me
martha
i
cried
no
wonder
child
she
answered
i
come
with
bad
news
your
uncle
has
had
a
fall
he
is
laid
up
at
wittenage
with
a
broken
right
i
burst
into
tears
oh
martha
i
cried
i
must
go
to
him
he
has
sent
for
me
she
answered
quietly
dick
is
putting
the
horse
to
the
he
does
want
me
then
i
said
but
it
seemed
a
voice
not
my
own
that
shrieked
the
words
the
punishment
of
my
sin
was
upon
me
never
would
he
have
sent
for
martha
and
not
me
i
thought
had
he
not
seen
that
i
had
gone
wrong
again
and
was
no
more
to
be
trusted
my
dear
said
martha
which
of
us
two
ought
to
be
the
better
nurse
you
never
saw
your
uncle
ill
i
nursed
him
at
death
door
then
you
do
think
he
is
angry
with
me
martha
i
said
humbled
before
myself
was
he
ever
angry
with
you
orbie
what
is
there
to
be
angry
about
i
never
saw
him
even
displeased
with
you
i
had
not
realized
that
my
uncle
was
suffering
only
that
he
was
disabled
now
the
fact
flashed
upon
me
and
with
it
the
perception
that
i
had
been
thinking
only
of
myself
i
was
fast
ceasing
to
care
for
him
and
then
horrible
to
tell
a
flash
of
joy
went
through
me
that
he
would
not
be
home
that
day
and
therefore
i
not
tell
him
anything
the
moment
martha
left
me
i
threw
myself
on
the
floor
of
the
desert
room
i
was
in
utter
misery
gladly
would
i
bear
every
pang
of
his
pain
i
said
to
myself
yet
i
have
not
asked
one
question
about
his
accident
he
must
be
in
danger
or
he
would
not
have
sent
for
martha
instead
of
me
how
had
the
thing
happened
i
wondered
had
death
fallen
with
him
perhaps
on
him
he
was
such
a
horseman
i
could
not
think
he
had
been
thrown
besides
death
was
a
good
horse
who
loved
his
master
dearly
i
was
sure
and
would
never
have
thrown
him
or
let
him
fall
a
great
gush
of
the
old
love
poured
from
the
fountain
in
my
heart
sympathy
with
the
horse
had
unsealed
it
i
sprang
from
the
floor
and
ran
down
to
entreat
martha
to
take
me
with
her
if
my
uncle
did
not
want
me
i
could
return
with
dick
but
she
was
gone
even
the
sound
of
her
wheels
was
gone
i
had
lain
on
the
floor
longer
than
i
knew
i
went
back
to
the
study
a
little
relieved
i
understood
now
that
i
was
not
glad
he
was
disabled
that
i
was
anything
but
glad
he
was
suffering
that
i
had
only
been
glad
for
an
instant
that
the
crisis
of
my
perplexity
was
postponed
in
the
meantime
i
should
see
john
day
who
would
help
me
to
understand
what
i
ought
to
do
very
strange
were
my
feelings
that
afternoon
in
the
lonely
house
i
had
always
felt
it
lonely
when
martha
never
when
my
uncle
was
out
yet
when
my
uncle
was
in
i
was
mostly
with
him
and
seldom
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
with
martha
our
feelings
are
odd
creatures
now
that
both
were
away
there
was
neither
time
nor
space
in
my
heart
for
feeling
the
house
desolate
while
the
world
outside
was
rich
as
a
of
mighty
kings
the
moment
i
was
a
little
more
comfortable
with
myself
my
thoughts
went
in
a
flock
to
the
face
that
looked
over
the
to
the
man
that
watched
me
while
i
slept
the
man
that
wrote
that
lovely
letter
inside
was
old
penny
with
her
broom
she
took
advantage
of
every
absence
to
sweep
or
scour
or
dust
outside
was
john
day
and
the
roses
of
the
wilderness
he
was
waiting
the
hour
to
come
to
me
wondering
how
i
would
receive
him
slowly
went
the
afternoon
i
had
fallen
in
love
at
first
sight
it
is
true
not
therefore
was
i
eager
to
meet
my
lover
i
was
only
more
than
willing
to
see
him
it
was
as
sweet
or
nearly
as
sweet
to
dream
of
his
coming
as
to
have
him
before
me
so
long
as
i
knew
he
was
indeed
coming
i
was
just
a
little
anxious
lest
i
should
not
find
him
altogether
so
beautiful
as
i
was
imagining
him
that
he
was
good
i
never
doubted
could
i
otherwise
have
fallen
in
love
with
him
and
his
letter
was
so
straightforward
so
manly
the
afternoon
was
cloudy
and
the
twilight
came
the
sooner
from
the
realms
of
the
dark
where
all
the
birds
of
night
build
their
nests
lining
them
with
their
own
sooty
down
the
sweet
odorous
filmy
dusk
of
the
summer
haunted
with
wings
of
noiseless
bats
began
at
length
to
come
flickering
earthward
in
a
snow
infinitesimal
of
fluffiest
gray
and
black
i
crept
out
into
the
garden
it
was
dark
as
wintry
night
among
the
yews
but
i
could
have
gone
any
time
through
every
alley
of
them
an
owl
cried
and
i
started
for
my
soul
was
sunk
in
its
own
there
came
a
sudden
sense
of
light
as
i
opened
the
door
into
the
wilderness
but
light
how
thin
and
pale
and
how
full
of
expectation
the
earth
and
the
vast
air
up
to
the
great
vault
seemed
to
throb
and
heave
with
life
or
was
it
that
my
spirit
lay
an
open
thoroughfare
to
the
life
of
the
all
with
the
scent
of
the
roses
and
the
humbler
inhabitants
of
the
wilderness
with
the
sound
of
the
brook
that
ran
through
it
flowing
from
the
heath
and
down
the
hill
with
the
silent
starbeams
and
the
insects
that
make
all
the
little
noises
they
can
with
the
thoughts
that
went
out
of
me
and
returned
possessed
of
the
earth
with
all
these
and
the
sense
of
thought
eternal
the
universe
was
full
as
it
could
hold
i
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
wall
and
looked
out
on
the
wild
suddenly
by
some
strange
reaction
it
seemed
out
of
creation
doors
out
in
the
illimitable
given
up
to
the
bare
to
the
space
that
had
no
walls
a
shiver
ran
through
me
i
turned
back
among
the
yews
it
was
early
i
would
wait
yet
a
while
if
he
were
already
there
he
too
would
enjoy
the
calm
of
a
lovely
little
wait
a
small
wind
came
searching
about
and
found
and
caressed
me
i
turned
to
it
it
played
with
my
hair
and
cooled
my
face
after
a
while
i
left
the
alley
passed
out
closed
the
door
behind
me
and
went
straying
through
the
broken
ground
of
the
wilderness
among
the
low
bushes
meandering
as
if
with
some
frolicsome
brook
for
a
companion
a
brook
of
capricious
windings
but
still
coming
nearer
to
the
fence
that
parted
the
wilderness
from
the
heath
my
eyes
bent
down
partly
to
avoid
the
hillocks
and
bushes
and
partly
from
shyness
of
the
moment
when
first
i
should
see
him
who
was
in
my
heart
and
somewhere
near
softly
the
moon
rose
round
and
full
there
was
still
so
much
light
in
the
sky
that
she
made
no
sudden
change
and
for
a
moment
i
did
not
feel
her
presence
or
look
up
in
front
of
me
the
high
ground
of
the
moor
sank
into
a
hollow
deeply
indenting
the
the
moon
was
rising
just
in
the
gap
and
when
i
did
look
up
the
lower
edge
of
her
disc
was
just
clear
of
the
earth
and
the
head
of
a
man
looking
over
the
fence
was
in
the
middle
of
the
great
moon
it
was
like
the
head
of
a
saint
in
a
missal
girt
with
a
halo
of
solid
gold
i
could
not
see
the
face
for
the
halo
hid
it
as
such
attributions
are
apt
to
do
but
it
must
be
he
and
strengthened
by
the
heavenly
vision
i
went
toward
him
walking
less
carefully
than
before
however
i
caught
my
foot
stumbled
and
fell
there
came
a
rush
through
the
bushes
he
was
by
my
side
lifted
me
like
a
child
and
held
me
in
his
arms
neither
was
i
more
frightened
than
a
child
caught
up
in
the
arms
of
any
friend
i
had
been
bred
in
faith
and
not
mistrust
but
indeed
my
head
had
struck
the
ground
with
such
force
that
had
i
been
inclined
i
could
scarcely
have
resisted
though
why
should
i
have
resisted
being
where
i
would
be
does
not
philosophy
tell
us
that
growth
and
development
cause
and
effect
are
all
and
that
the
days
and
years
are
of
no
account
and
does
not
more
than
philosophy
tell
us
that
truth
is
everything
my
darling
are
you
hurt
murmured
the
voice
whose
echoes
seemed
to
have
haunted
me
for
centuries
a
little
i
answered
i
shall
be
all
right
in
a
i
did
not
add
put
me
down
please
for
i
did
not
want
to
be
put
down
directly
i
could
not
have
stood
if
he
had
put
me
down
i
grew
faint
life
came
back
and
i
felt
myself
growing
heavy
in
his
arms
i
think
i
can
stand
now
i
said
please
put
me
he
obeyed
immediately
i
nearly
broken
your
arms
i
said
ashamed
of
having
become
a
burden
to
him
the
moment
we
met
i
could
run
with
you
to
the
top
of
the
hill
he
answered
i
do
think
you
could
i
returned
perhaps
i
leaned
a
little
toward
him
i
do
not
know
he
put
his
arm
round
me
you
are
not
able
to
stand
he
said
shall
we
sit
a
moment
chapter
xiv
mother
and
uncle
i
was
glad
enough
to
sink
on
a
clump
of
white
clover
he
stretched
himself
on
the
heather
a
little
way
from
me
silence
followed
he
was
giving
me
time
to
recover
myself
as
soon
therefore
as
i
was
able
it
was
my
part
to
speak
where
is
your
horse
i
asked
the
first
word
is
generally
one
hardly
worth
saying
i
left
him
at
a
little
farmhouse
about
a
mile
from
here
i
was
afraid
to
bring
him
farther
lest
my
mother
should
learn
where
i
had
been
she
takes
pains
to
then
will
she
not
find
out
i
do
will
she
not
ask
you
where
you
were
perhaps
there
no
you
will
tell
her
of
course
if
she
does
i
think
ought
you
you
are
sure
you
do
mean
you
will
tell
her
a
story
certainly
what
will
you
do
then
i
will
tell
her
that
i
will
not
tell
would
that
be
right
through
the
dusk
i
could
see
the
light
of
his
smile
as
he
answered
i
think
so
i
shall
not
tell
but
i
began
he
interrupted
me
my
heart
was
sinking
within
me
not
only
had
i
wanted
him
to
help
me
to
tell
my
uncle
but
i
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
having
with
any
man
a
secret
from
his
mother
it
must
look
strange
to
you
he
said
but
you
do
not
know
my
mother
i
think
i
do
know
your
mother
i
rejoined
she
saved
my
poor
little
life
i
am
not
sure
it
was
your
mother
but
i
think
it
how
was
that
he
said
much
surprised
when
was
it
many
years
ago
i
can
not
tell
how
many
i
answered
but
i
remember
all
about
it
well
enough
i
can
not
have
been
more
than
eight
i
could
she
have
been
at
the
manor
then
he
said
putting
the
question
to
himself
not
me
how
was
it
tell
me
he
went
on
rising
to
his
feet
and
looking
at
me
with
almost
a
frightened
expression
i
told
him
the
incident
and
he
heard
me
in
absolute
silence
when
i
had
done
it
my
mother
he
broke
out
i
do
know
one
other
woman
who
would
have
let
a
child
walk
like
that
any
other
would
have
taken
you
up
or
put
you
on
the
horse
and
walked
beside
you
a
gentleman
would
i
know
i
replied
but
it
would
not
be
so
easy
for
a
lady
could
have
done
either
well
enough
she
as
strong
as
a
horse
herself
and
rides
like
an
amazon
but
i
am
not
in
the
least
surprised
it
was
just
like
her
you
poor
little
darling
it
nearly
makes
me
cry
to
think
of
the
tiny
feet
going
tramp
tramp
all
that
horrible
way
and
she
high
up
on
her
big
horse
she
always
rides
the
biggest
horse
she
can
get
and
then
never
to
say
a
word
to
you
after
she
brought
you
home
or
see
you
the
next
morning
mr
day
i
returned
i
would
not
have
told
you
had
i
known
it
would
give
you
occasion
to
speak
so
naughtily
of
your
mother
you
make
me
he
was
silent
i
thought
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
and
was
sorry
for
him
but
my
sympathy
was
wasted
he
broke
into
a
murmuring
laugh
of
merriment
when
is
a
mother
not
a
mother
he
said
do
you
give
it
up
when
she
a
north
wind
when
she
a
roman
emperor
when
she
an
iceberg
when
she
a
brass
there
that
do
mother
for
the
present
i
may
know
much
as
she
always
telling
me
but
i
do
know
that
a
noun
is
not
a
thing
nor
a
name
a
person
i
would
have
expostulated
for
love
sake
dearest
he
pleaded
we
will
not
dispute
where
only
one
of
us
knows
i
will
tell
you
all
some
day
soon
i
hope
very
soon
i
am
angry
now
poor
little
tramping
child
i
saw
i
had
been
behaving
presumptuously
i
had
wanted
to
argue
while
yet
in
absolute
ignorance
of
the
thing
in
hand
had
not
my
uncle
taught
me
the
folly
of
reasoning
from
the
ideal
where
i
knew
nothing
of
the
actual
the
ideal
must
be
our
guide
how
to
treat
the
actual
but
the
actual
must
be
there
to
treat
one
thing
more
i
saw
that
there
could
be
no
likeness
between
his
mother
and
my
uncle
will
you
tell
me
something
about
yourself
then
i
said
that
would
not
be
interesting
he
objected
then
why
are
you
here
i
returned
can
any
person
without
a
history
be
interesting
yes
he
answered
a
person
that
was
going
to
have
a
history
might
be
could
a
person
with
a
history
that
was
not
worth
telling
be
interesting
but
i
know
yours
will
interest
me
in
the
hearing
therefore
it
ought
to
interest
you
in
the
telling
i
see
he
rejoined
with
his
merry
laugh
i
shall
have
to
be
careful
my
lady
will
at
once
pounce
upon
the
weak
points
of
my
logic
i
am
no
logician
i
answered
i
only
know
when
i
do
know
a
thing
my
uncle
has
taught
me
that
wisdom
lies
in
yours
must
be
a
very
unusual
kind
of
uncle
he
returned
if
god
had
made
many
men
like
my
uncle
i
think
the
world
would
be
the
same
i
wonder
why
he
did
he
said
thoughtfully
i
have
wondered
much
and
can
not
tell
i
replied
what
if
it
would
be
good
for
the
world
to
have
many
good
men
in
it
before
it
was
ready
to
treat
them
properly
he
suggested
the
words
let
me
know
that
at
least
he
could
think
hitherto
my
uncle
had
seemed
to
me
the
only
man
that
thought
but
i
had
seen
very
few
men
perhaps
that
is
it
i
answered
i
will
think
about
were
you
brought
up
at
rising
have
you
been
there
all
the
time
were
you
there
that
night
i
should
surely
have
known
had
you
been
in
the
house
he
looked
at
me
with
a
grateful
smile
i
was
not
brought
up
there
he
answered
rising
is
mine
however
at
least
it
will
be
when
i
come
of
age
it
was
left
me
some
ten
years
ago
by
a
my
father
property
will
be
mine
too
of
course
my
mother
is
in
ireland
she
ought
to
be
there
not
here
but
she
likes
my
estates
better
than
her
own
and
makes
the
most
of
being
my
you
would
not
have
her
there
if
she
is
happier
here
all
who
have
land
ought
to
live
on
it
or
else
give
it
to
those
who
will
what
makes
it
theirs
if
their
only
connection
with
it
is
the
money
it
brings
them
if
i
let
my
horse
run
wild
over
the
country
how
could
i
claim
him
and
refuse
to
pay
his
damages
i
do
quite
understand
i
only
mean
there
is
no
bond
where
both
ends
are
not
tied
my
mother
has
no
sense
of
obligation
so
far
as
ever
i
have
been
able
to
see
but
do
not
be
afraid
i
would
as
soon
take
a
wife
to
the
house
she
was
in
as
i
would
ask
her
to
creep
with
me
into
the
den
of
a
it
was
too
dreadful
i
rose
he
sprang
to
his
feet
you
must
excuse
me
sir
i
said
with
one
who
can
speak
so
of
his
mother
i
am
where
i
ought
not
to
you
have
a
right
to
know
what
my
mother
is
he
answered
coldly
i
thought
and
i
should
not
be
a
true
man
if
i
spoke
of
her
otherwise
than
he
would
pretend
nothing
to
please
me
i
saw
that
i
was
again
in
the
wrong
was
i
so
ill
read
as
to
imagine
that
a
mother
must
of
necessity
be
a
good
woman
was
he
to
speak
of
his
mother
as
he
did
not
believe
of
her
or
be
unfit
for
my
company
would
untruth
be
a
bond
between
us
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
i
was
wrong
but
you
can
hardly
wonder
i
should
be
shocked
to
hear
a
son
speak
so
of
his
mother
and
to
one
all
but
a
stranger
what
he
returned
with
a
look
of
surprise
do
you
think
of
me
so
i
feel
as
if
i
had
known
you
all
my
life
and
before
it
i
felt
ashamed
and
was
silent
if
he
was
such
a
stranger
why
was
i
there
alone
with
him
you
must
not
think
i
speak
so
to
any
one
he
went
on
of
those
who
know
my
mother
not
one
has
a
right
to
demand
of
me
anything
concerning
her
but
how
could
i
ask
you
to
see
me
and
hide
from
you
the
truth
about
her
prudence
would
tell
you
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
son
of
such
a
woman
could
i
be
a
true
man
true
to
you
and
hold
my
tongue
about
her
i
should
be
a
liar
of
the
worst
sort
he
felt
far
too
strongly
it
was
plain
to
heed
a
world
of
commonplaces
forgive
me
i
said
may
i
sit
down
again
he
held
out
his
hand
i
took
it
and
reseated
myself
on
the
he
laid
himself
again
beside
me
and
after
a
little
silence
began
to
relate
what
occurred
to
him
of
his
external
history
while
all
the
time
i
was
watching
for
hints
as
to
how
he
had
come
to
be
the
man
he
was
it
was
clear
he
did
not
find
it
easy
to
talk
about
himself
but
soon
i
no
longer
doubted
whether
i
ought
to
have
met
him
and
loved
him
a
great
deal
more
by
the
time
he
had
done
i
then
told
him
in
return
what
my
life
had
hitherto
been
how
i
knew
nothing
of
father
or
mother
how
my
uncle
had
been
everything
to
me
how
he
had
taught
me
all
i
knew
had
helped
me
to
love
what
was
good
and
hate
what
was
evil
had
enabled
me
to
value
good
books
and
turn
away
from
foolish
ones
in
short
i
made
him
feel
that
all
his
mother
had
not
been
to
him
my
uncle
had
been
to
me
and
that
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
make
me
as
much
indebted
to
a
husband
as
already
i
was
to
my
uncle
then
i
put
the
question
what
would
you
think
of
me
if
i
had
a
secret
from
an
uncle
like
that
if
i
had
an
uncle
like
that
he
answered
i
would
sooner
cut
my
throat
than
keep
anything
from
him
i
have
not
told
him
i
said
what
happened
or
but
you
will
tell
him
the
first
moment
i
can
but
i
hope
you
understand
it
is
hard
to
do
my
love
for
my
uncle
makes
it
hard
it
has
the
look
of
turning
away
from
him
to
love
another
with
that
i
burst
out
crying
i
could
not
help
it
he
let
me
cry
and
did
not
interfere
i
was
grateful
for
that
when
at
length
i
raised
my
head
he
spoke
it
has
that
look
he
said
but
i
trust
it
is
only
a
look
anyhow
he
knows
that
such
things
must
be
and
the
more
of
a
good
man
and
a
gentleman
he
is
the
less
will
he
be
pained
that
we
should
love
one
another
i
am
sure
of
that
i
replied
i
am
only
afraid
that
he
may
never
have
been
in
love
himself
and
does
not
know
how
it
feels
and
may
think
i
have
forsaken
him
for
are
you
with
him
no
i
am
sometimes
a
good
deal
alone
i
can
be
alone
as
much
as
i
like
he
always
gives
me
perfect
liberty
but
i
never
before
wanted
to
be
alone
when
i
could
be
with
but
he
live
without
you
yes
indeed
i
cried
he
would
be
a
poor
creature
that
could
not
live
without
another
he
said
nothing
and
i
added
he
often
goes
out
alone
sometimes
in
the
darkest
then
be
sure
he
knows
what
love
but
if
you
would
rather
i
will
tell
i
could
not
have
any
one
even
you
tell
my
uncle
about
you
are
right
when
will
you
tell
him
i
can
not
be
sure
i
would
go
to
him
but
i
am
afraid
they
will
not
let
me
until
he
has
got
a
little
over
this
accident
i
answered
and
told
him
what
had
happened
it
is
dreadful
to
think
how
he
must
have
suffered
i
said
and
how
much
more
i
should
have
thought
about
it
but
for
you
it
tears
my
heart
why
was
it
made
bigger
perhaps
that
is
just
what
is
now
being
done
with
it
he
answered
i
hope
it
may
be
i
returned
but
it
is
time
i
went
shall
i
not
see
you
again
evening
he
asked
no
i
answered
i
must
not
see
you
again
till
i
have
told
my
uncle
you
do
not
mean
for
weeks
and
weeks
till
he
is
well
enough
to
come
home
how
i
to
live
till
then
as
i
shall
have
to
live
but
i
hope
it
will
be
but
for
a
few
days
at
most
only
then
it
will
depend
on
what
my
uncle
thinks
of
the
will
he
decide
for
you
what
you
are
to
do
yes
i
think
so
perhaps
if
he
were
i
was
on
the
point
of
saying
like
your
mother
but
i
stopped
in
time
or
hardly
for
i
think
he
saw
what
i
just
saved
myself
from
it
was
but
the
other
morning
i
made
the
discovery
that
all
our
life
together
john
has
never
once
pressed
me
to
complete
a
sentence
i
broke
off
he
looked
so
sorrowful
that
i
was
driven
to
add
something
i
do
think
there
is
much
good
i
said
in
resolving
what
you
will
or
will
not
do
before
the
occasion
appears
for
it
may
have
something
in
it
you
never
reckoned
on
all
i
can
say
is
i
will
try
to
do
what
is
right
i
can
not
promise
anything
without
knowing
what
my
uncle
we
rose
he
took
me
in
his
arms
for
just
an
instant
and
we
parted
with
the
understanding
that
i
was
to
write
to
him
as
soon
as
i
had
spoken
with
my
uncle
chapter
xv
the
time
between
i
now
felt
quite
able
to
confess
to
my
uncle
both
what
i
had
thought
and
what
i
had
done
true
i
had
much
more
to
confess
than
when
my
trouble
first
awoke
but
the
growth
in
the
matter
of
the
confession
had
been
such
a
growth
in
definiteness
as
well
as
to
make
its
utterance
though
more
weighty
yet
much
easier
if
i
might
be
in
doubt
about
revealing
my
thoughts
i
could
be
in
none
about
revealing
my
actions
and
i
found
it
was
much
less
appalling
to
make
known
my
feelings
when
i
had
the
words
of
john
day
to
confess
as
well
i
may
here
be
allowed
to
remark
how
much
easier
an
action
is
when
demanded
than
it
seems
while
in
the
contingent
future
how
much
easier
when
the
thing
is
before
you
in
its
reality
and
not
as
a
mere
the
thing
itself
and
the
idea
of
it
are
two
such
different
grounds
upon
which
to
come
either
to
a
decision
or
to
action
one
thing
more
when
a
woman
wants
to
do
the
right
i
do
not
mean
wants
to
coax
the
right
to
side
with
her
she
will
somehow
be
led
up
to
it
my
uncle
was
very
feverish
and
troubled
the
first
night
and
had
a
good
deal
of
delirium
during
which
his
care
and
anxiety
seemed
all
about
me
martha
had
to
assure
him
every
other
moment
that
i
was
well
and
in
no
danger
of
any
sort
he
would
be
silent
for
a
time
and
then
again
show
himself
tormented
with
forebodings
about
me
in
the
morning
however
he
was
better
only
he
looked
sadder
than
usual
she
thought
he
was
for
some
cause
or
other
in
reality
anxious
about
me
so
much
i
gathered
from
martha
letter
by
no
means
scholarly
but
graphic
enough
it
gave
me
much
pain
my
uncle
was
miserable
about
me
he
had
plainly
seen
he
knew
and
felt
that
something
had
come
between
us
alas
it
was
no
fancy
of
his
soul
whether
i
was
in
fault
or
not
there
was
that
something
it
troubled
the
unity
that
had
hitherto
seemed
a
thing
essential
and
indivisible
dared
i
go
to
him
without
a
summons
i
knew
martha
would
call
me
the
moment
the
doctor
allowed
her
it
would
not
be
right
to
go
without
that
call
what
i
had
to
tell
might
justify
far
more
anxiety
than
the
sight
of
me
would
counteract
if
i
said
nothing
the
keen
eye
of
his
love
would
assure
itself
of
the
something
hid
in
my
silence
and
he
would
not
see
that
i
was
but
waiting
his
improvement
to
tell
him
everything
i
resolved
therefore
to
remain
where
i
was
the
next
two
days
were
perhaps
the
most
uncomfortable
ever
i
spent
a
secret
one
desires
to
turn
out
of
doors
at
the
first
opportunity
is
not
a
pleasant
companion
i
do
not
say
i
was
unhappy
still
less
that
once
i
wished
i
had
not
seen
john
day
but
oh
how
i
longed
to
love
him
openly
how
i
longed
for
my
uncle
sanction
without
which
our
love
could
not
be
perfected
then
john
mother
was
by
no
means
a
gladsome
thought
except
that
he
must
be
a
good
man
indeed
who
was
good
in
spite
of
being
unable
to
love
respect
or
trust
his
mother
the
true
notion
of
heaven
is
to
be
with
everybody
one
loves
to
him
the
presence
of
his
mother
such
as
she
was
that
is
would
destroy
any
heaven
what
a
painful
but
salutary
shock
it
will
be
to
those
whose
existence
is
such
a
glorifying
of
themselves
that
they
imagine
their
presence
necessary
to
all
about
them
when
they
learn
that
their
disappearance
from
the
world
sent
a
thrill
of
relief
through
the
hearts
of
those
nearest
them
to
learn
how
little
they
were
prized
will
one
day
prove
a
strong
medicine
for
souls
there
is
nothing
covered
that
shall
not
be
chapter
xvi
fault
and
no
fault
the
next
day
i
kept
the
house
till
the
evening
and
then
went
walking
in
the
garden
in
the
twilight
between
the
dark
alleys
and
the
open
wilderness
i
flitted
and
wandered
alternating
gloom
and
gleam
outside
me
even
as
they
chased
one
another
within
me
in
the
wilderness
i
looked
up
and
there
was
john
he
stood
outside
the
fence
just
as
i
had
seen
him
the
night
before
only
now
there
was
no
aureole
about
his
head
the
moon
had
not
yet
reached
the
horizon
my
first
feeling
was
anger
he
had
broken
our
agreement
i
did
not
reflect
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
breaking
a
law
or
even
a
promise
and
being
blameless
he
leaped
the
fence
and
clearing
every
bush
like
a
deer
came
straight
toward
me
it
was
no
use
trying
to
escape
him
i
turned
my
back
and
stood
he
stopped
close
behind
me
a
yard
or
two
away
will
you
not
speak
to
me
he
said
it
is
not
my
fault
i
am
whose
fault
then
pray
i
rejoined
with
difficulty
keeping
my
position
is
it
mine
my
mother
he
answered
i
turned
and
looked
him
in
the
eyes
through
the
dusk
saw
that
he
was
troubled
ran
to
him
and
put
my
arms
about
him
she
has
been
spying
he
said
as
soon
as
he
could
speak
she
will
part
us
at
any
risk
if
she
can
she
is
having
us
watched
this
very
moment
most
likely
she
may
be
watching
us
herself
she
is
a
terrible
woman
when
she
is
for
or
against
anything
literally
i
do
not
know
what
she
would
not
do
to
get
her
own
way
she
lives
for
her
own
way
the
loss
of
it
would
be
to
her
as
the
loss
of
her
soul
she
will
lose
it
this
time
though
she
will
fail
this
time
if
she
never
did
before
well
i
returned
nowise
inclined
to
take
her
part
i
hope
she
will
fail
what
does
she
say
she
says
she
would
rather
go
to
her
grave
than
see
me
your
why
your
family
seems
objectionable
to
what
is
there
against
it
nothing
that
i
what
is
there
against
my
uncle
is
there
anything
against
martha
moon
i
was
indignant
at
the
idea
of
a
whisper
against
either
what
have
done
i
went
on
we
are
all
of
the
family
i
know
what
is
it
i
do
think
she
has
had
time
to
invent
anything
yet
but
she
pretends
there
is
something
and
says
if
i
do
give
you
up
if
i
do
swear
never
to
look
at
you
again
she
will
tell
what
did
you
answer
her
i
said
no
power
on
earth
should
make
me
give
you
up
whatever
she
knew
she
could
know
nothing
against
and
i
was
as
ready
to
go
to
my
grave
as
she
was
i
said
may
tell
my
determination
by
your
own
whether
i
marry
her
or
not
you
and
i
part
company
the
day
i
come
of
age
and
if
you
speak
word
or
do
deed
against
one
of
her
family
my
lawyer
shall
look
strictly
into
your
accounts
as
my
guardian
you
see
i
knew
where
to
touch
her
it
is
dreadful
you
should
have
to
speak
like
that
to
your
mother
it
is
but
you
would
feel
to
her
just
as
i
do
if
you
knew
all
though
you
would
speak
so
roughly
i
can
you
guess
what
she
has
in
her
mind
not
in
the
least
she
will
pretend
anything
it
is
enough
that
she
is
determined
to
part
us
how
she
cares
nothing
so
she
but
she
can
not
it
rests
with
how
with
me
it
will
be
war
to
the
knife
between
her
and
me
if
she
succeed
it
must
be
with
you
i
will
do
anything
to
foil
her
except
what
if
she
should
make
you
see
it
your
duty
to
give
me
up
what
if
there
were
no
difference
between
right
and
wrong
we
as
good
as
married
yes
of
course
but
i
can
not
quite
promise
you
know
until
i
hear
what
my
uncle
will
if
your
uncle
is
half
so
good
a
man
as
you
have
made
me
think
him
he
will
do
what
he
can
on
our
side
he
loves
what
is
fair
and
what
can
be
fairer
than
that
those
who
love
each
other
should
marry
i
knew
my
uncle
would
not
willingly
interfere
with
my
happiness
and
for
myself
i
should
never
marry
another
than
john
day
that
was
a
thing
of
course
had
he
not
kissed
me
but
the
best
of
lovers
had
been
parted
and
that
which
had
been
might
be
again
though
i
could
not
see
how
it
good
nevertheless
to
hear
john
talk
it
was
the
right
way
for
a
lover
to
talk
still
he
had
no
supremacy
over
what
was
to
be
some
would
say
it
can
not
be
so
great
a
matter
to
us
when
we
have
known
each
other
such
a
little
while
i
remarked
the
true
time
is
the
long
time
he
replied
would
it
be
a
sign
that
our
love
was
strong
that
it
took
a
great
while
to
come
to
anything
the
strongest
things
there
he
stopped
and
i
saw
why
strongest
things
are
not
generally
of
quickest
growth
but
there
was
the
eucalyptus
and
was
not
paul
as
good
a
christian
as
any
of
them
i
said
nothing
however
there
was
indeed
no
rule
in
the
matter
you
must
allow
it
possible
i
said
that
we
may
not
be
married
i
will
not
he
answered
it
is
true
my
mother
may
get
me
brought
in
as
incapable
of
managing
my
own
affairs
but
what
mother
would
do
such
a
wicked
thing
i
cried
mother
he
answered
oh
she
i
ca
believe
i
am
sure
of
i
held
my
peace
i
could
not
help
a
sense
of
dismay
at
finding
myself
so
near
such
a
woman
i
knew
of
bad
women
but
only
in
books
it
would
appear
they
were
in
other
places
as
well
we
must
be
on
our
guard
he
said
against
what
i
do
know
whatever
she
may
we
ca
do
anything
till
she
begins
she
has
how
i
asked
incredulous
leander
is
lame
he
answered
i
am
so
sorry
i
am
so
angry
is
it
possible
i
understand
you
quite
did
how
do
you
know
i
can
no
more
prove
it
than
i
can
doubt
it
i
can
not
inquire
into
my
mother
proceedings
i
leave
that
sort
of
thing
to
her
let
her
spy
on
me
as
she
will
i
am
not
going
to
spy
on
of
course
not
but
if
you
have
no
proof
how
can
you
state
the
thing
as
a
fact
i
have
what
is
proof
enough
for
saying
it
to
my
own
but
you
have
spoken
of
it
to
me
you
are
my
better
soul
if
you
are
not
then
i
have
done
wrong
in
saying
it
to
i
hastened
to
tell
him
i
had
only
made
him
say
what
i
hoped
he
meant
only
i
was
his
soul
he
wanted
me
then
to
promise
that
i
would
marry
him
in
spite
of
any
and
every
thing
i
promised
that
i
would
never
marry
any
one
but
him
i
could
not
say
more
i
said
not
knowing
what
my
uncle
might
think
but
so
much
it
was
only
fair
to
say
for
i
had
gone
so
far
as
to
let
him
know
distinctly
that
i
loved
him
and
what
sort
would
that
love
be
that
could
regard
it
as
possible
at
any
distance
of
time
to
marry
another
or
what
sort
of
woman
could
she
be
that
would
shrink
from
such
a
pledge
the
mischief
lies
in
promises
made
without
forecasting
thought
i
knew
what
i
was
about
i
saw
forward
and
backward
and
all
around
me
a
solitary
education
opens
eyes
that
in
the
midst
of
companions
and
engagements
are
apt
to
remain
shut
knowledge
of
the
world
is
no
safeguard
to
man
or
woman
in
the
knowledge
and
love
of
truth
lies
our
only
safety
with
that
promise
he
had
to
be
and
was
content
chapter
xvii
the
summons
next
morning
the
post
brought
me
the
following
letter
from
my
uncle
whoever
of
my
readers
may
care
to
enter
into
my
feelings
as
i
read
must
imagine
them
for
herself
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
them
the
letter
was
not
easy
to
read
as
it
was
written
in
bed
and
with
his
left
hand
my
little
one
i
think
i
know
more
than
you
imagine
i
think
the
secret
flew
into
your
heart
of
itself
you
did
not
take
it
up
and
put
it
there
i
think
you
tried
to
drive
it
out
and
it
would
not
go
the
same
fate
that
clips
the
thread
of
life
had
clipped
its
wings
that
it
could
fly
no
more
did
my
little
one
think
i
had
not
a
heart
big
enough
to
hold
her
secret
i
wish
it
had
not
been
so
it
has
made
her
suffer
i
pray
my
little
one
to
be
sure
that
i
am
all
on
her
side
that
my
will
is
to
do
and
contrive
the
best
for
her
that
lies
in
my
power
should
i
be
unable
to
do
what
she
would
like
she
must
yet
believe
me
true
to
her
as
to
my
god
less
than
whom
only
i
love
her
less
because
god
is
so
much
bigger
that
so
much
more
love
will
hang
upon
him
i
love
you
dear
more
than
any
other
creature
except
one
and
that
one
is
not
in
this
world
be
sure
that
whatever
it
may
cost
me
i
will
be
to
you
what
your
own
perfected
soul
will
approve
not
to
do
my
best
for
you
would
be
to
be
false
not
to
god
only
but
to
your
father
as
well
whom
i
loved
and
love
dearly
come
to
me
my
child
and
tell
me
all
i
know
you
have
done
nothing
wrong
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
some
things
are
so
difficult
to
tell
that
it
needs
help
to
make
way
for
them
i
will
help
you
i
am
better
come
to
me
at
once
and
we
will
break
the
creature
shell
together
and
see
what
it
is
like
the
shy
thing
your
i
was
so
eager
to
go
to
him
that
it
was
with
difficulty
i
finished
his
letter
before
starting
death
had
been
sent
home
and
was
in
the
stable
sorely
missing
his
master
i
called
dick
and
told
him
to
get
ready
to
ride
with
me
to
wittenage
he
must
take
thanatos
and
be
at
the
door
with
zoe
in
twenty
minutes
we
started
as
we
left
the
gate
i
caught
sight
of
john
coming
from
the
other
direction
his
eyes
on
the
ground
lost
in
meditation
i
stopped
he
looked
up
saw
me
and
was
at
my
side
in
two
moments
i
have
heard
from
my
uncle
i
said
he
wants
me
i
am
going
to
if
only
i
had
my
horse
he
answered
why
should
you
take
thanatos
i
rejoined
no
he
answered
after
a
moment
hesitation
it
would
be
an
impertinence
i
will
walk
and
perhaps
see
you
there
it
only
sixteen
miles
i
what
a
splendid
creature
he
is
he
getting
into
years
now
i
replied
but
he
has
been
in
the
stable
several
days
and
i
am
doubtful
whether
dick
will
feel
quite
at
home
on
then
your
uncle
would
rather
i
rode
him
he
knows
i
am
no
tailor
said
john
how
i
asked
i
do
mean
he
knows
who
i
am
but
he
saw
me
a
fortnight
ago
in
one
of
our
fields
giving
leander
who
is
but
three
a
lesson
or
two
he
stopped
and
looked
on
for
a
good
many
minutes
and
said
a
kind
word
about
my
handling
of
the
horse
he
will
remember
i
am
how
glad
i
am
he
knows
something
of
you
if
you
do
mind
being
seen
with
me
then
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
not
give
me
your
dick
was
not
sorry
to
dismount
and
we
rode
away
together
i
was
glad
of
this
for
one
definite
reason
as
well
as
many
indefinite
i
wanted
john
to
see
my
letter
and
know
what
cause
i
had
to
love
my
uncle
i
forgot
for
the
moment
my
resolution
not
to
meet
him
again
before
telling
my
uncle
everything
somehow
he
seemed
to
be
going
with
me
to
receive
my
uncle
approval
he
read
the
letter
old
death
carrying
him
all
the
time
as
gently
as
he
carried
myself
i
often
rode
him
now
and
returned
it
with
the
tears
in
his
eyes
for
a
moment
or
two
he
did
not
speak
then
he
said
in
a
very
solemn
way
i
see
i
ought
to
have
a
chance
if
he
be
against
me
i
understand
now
why
i
could
not
get
you
to
promise
all
right
the
lord
have
mercy
upon
me
that
he
will
he
is
always
having
mercy
upon
us
i
answered
loving
john
and
my
uncle
and
god
more
than
ever
i
loved
john
for
this
especially
at
the
moment
that
his
nature
remained
uninjured
toward
others
by
his
distrust
of
her
who
should
have
had
the
first
claim
on
his
confidence
i
said
to
myself
that
if
a
man
had
a
bad
mother
and
yet
was
a
good
man
there
could
be
no
limit
to
the
goodness
he
must
come
to
that
he
was
a
man
after
my
uncle
own
heart
i
had
no
longer
the
least
doubt
nor
was
it
a
small
thing
to
me
that
he
rode
beautifully
never
seeming
to
heed
his
horse
and
yet
in
constant
touch
with
him
we
reached
the
town
and
the
inn
where
my
uncle
was
lying
on
the
road
we
had
arranged
where
he
would
be
waiting
me
to
hear
what
came
next
he
went
to
see
the
horses
put
up
and
i
ran
to
find
martha
she
met
me
on
the
stair
and
went
straight
to
my
uncle
to
tell
him
i
was
come
returned
almost
immediately
and
led
me
to
his
room
i
was
shocked
to
see
how
pale
and
ill
he
looked
i
feared
and
was
right
in
fearing
that
anxiety
about
myself
had
not
a
little
to
do
with
his
condition
his
face
brightened
when
he
saw
me
but
his
eyes
gazed
into
mine
with
a
searching
inquiry
his
face
brightened
yet
more
when
he
found
his
eager
look
answered
by
the
smile
which
my
perfect
satisfaction
inspired
i
knelt
by
the
bedside
afraid
to
touch
him
lest
i
should
hurt
his
arm
slowly
he
laid
his
left
hand
on
my
head
and
i
knew
he
blessed
me
silently
for
a
minute
or
two
he
lay
still
now
tell
me
all
about
it
he
said
at
length
turning
his
patient
blue
eyes
on
mine
i
began
at
once
and
if
i
did
not
tell
him
all
i
let
it
be
plain
there
was
more
of
the
sort
behind
concerning
which
he
might
question
me
when
i
had
ended
is
that
everything
he
asked
with
a
smile
so
like
all
he
had
ever
been
to
me
that
my
whole
heart
seemed
to
go
out
to
meet
it
yes
uncle
i
answered
i
think
i
may
say
so
except
that
i
have
not
dwelt
upon
my
feelings
love
they
say
is
shy
and
i
fancy
you
will
pardon
me
that
willingly
my
child
more
is
quite
then
you
know
all
about
it
uncle
i
ventured
i
was
afraid
you
might
not
understand
me
could
any
one
do
you
think
that
had
not
had
the
same
experience
he
made
me
no
answer
i
looked
up
he
was
ghastly
white
his
head
had
fallen
back
against
the
bed
i
started
up
hardly
smothering
a
shriek
what
is
it
uncle
i
gasped
shall
i
fetch
martha
no
my
child
he
answered
i
shall
be
better
in
a
moment
i
am
subject
to
little
attacks
of
the
heart
but
they
do
not
mean
much
give
me
some
of
that
medicine
on
the
in
a
few
minutes
his
colour
began
to
return
and
the
smile
which
was
forced
at
first
gradually
brightened
until
it
was
genuine
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
story
one
day
he
said
whether
in
this
world
i
am
doubtful
but
is
nothing
or
with
eternity
before
yes
uncle
i
answered
vaguely
as
i
knelt
again
by
the
bedside
a
person
he
said
after
a
while
slowly
and
with
hesitating
effort
may
look
and
feel
a
much
better
person
at
one
time
than
at
another
upon
occasion
he
is
so
happy
or
perhaps
so
well
pleased
with
himself
that
the
good
in
him
comes
all
to
the
would
he
be
the
better
or
the
worse
man
if
it
did
not
uncle
i
asked
you
must
not
get
me
into
a
metaphysical
discussion
little
one
he
answered
we
have
something
more
important
on
our
hands
i
want
you
to
note
that
when
a
person
is
happy
he
may
look
lovable
whereas
things
going
as
he
does
not
like
another
and
very
unfinished
phase
of
his
character
may
surely
everybody
must
know
that
uncle
then
you
can
hardly
expect
me
to
be
confident
that
your
new
friend
would
appear
as
lovable
if
he
were
unhappy
i
have
seen
you
uncle
look
as
if
nothing
would
ever
make
you
smile
again
but
i
knew
you
loved
me
all
the
did
you
my
darling
then
you
were
right
i
dare
not
require
of
any
man
that
he
should
be
as
in
trouble
as
out
of
it
though
he
must
come
to
that
at
last
but
a
man
must
be
whatever
mood
he
is
that
is
what
i
always
knew
you
to
be
uncle
i
never
waited
for
a
change
in
your
looks
to
tell
you
anything
i
wanted
to
tell
i
know
you
uncle
i
added
with
a
glow
of
still
triumph
thank
you
little
one
he
returned
half
playfully
yet
gravely
all
i
want
to
say
comes
to
this
he
resumed
after
a
pause
that
when
a
man
is
in
love
you
see
only
the
best
of
him
or
something
better
than
he
really
is
much
good
may
be
in
a
man
for
god
made
him
and
the
man
yet
not
be
good
for
he
has
done
nothing
since
his
making
to
make
himself
before
you
can
say
you
know
a
man
you
must
have
seen
him
in
a
few
at
least
of
his
opposite
moods
therefore
you
can
not
wonder
that
i
should
desire
a
fuller
assurance
of
this
young
man
than
your
testimony
founded
on
an
acquaintance
of
three
or
four
days
can
give
let
me
tell
you
then
something
that
happened
i
answered
when
first
i
asked
him
to
come
with
me
this
morning
it
was
a
temptation
to
him
of
course
not
knowing
when
we
might
see
each
other
again
but
he
had
his
own
horse
and
said
it
would
be
an
impertinence
to
ride
i
hope
you
did
not
come
alone
oh
no
i
had
set
out
with
dick
but
john
came
after
then
his
refusal
to
ride
my
horse
does
not
come
to
much
it
is
a
small
thing
to
have
good
impulses
if
temptation
is
too
much
for
but
i
have
done
telling
you
uncle
i
am
hasty
little
one
i
beg
your
i
have
to
tell
you
what
made
him
give
in
to
riding
your
horse
i
confessed
i
was
a
little
anxious
lest
death
who
had
not
been
exercised
for
some
days
should
be
too
much
for
dick
john
said
then
he
thought
he
might
venture
for
you
had
once
spoken
very
kindly
to
him
of
the
way
he
handled
his
own
oh
that
the
young
fellow
is
it
cried
my
uncle
in
a
tone
that
could
not
be
taken
for
other
than
one
of
pleasure
that
the
fellow
is
it
he
repeated
h
i
hope
you
liked
the
look
of
him
uncle
i
said
the
boy
is
a
gentleman
anyhow
he
you
may
think
whether
i
was
pleased
i
never
saw
man
carry
himself
better
horseward
he
added
with
a
smile
then
you
wo
object
to
his
riding
death
home
again
not
in
the
least
he
replied
the
man
can
and
may
i
go
with
him
that
is
if
you
do
not
want
me
i
wish
i
could
stay
with
you
rather
than
ride
home
with
him
yes
indeed
if
it
were
to
be
of
use
to
you
the
only
way
you
can
be
of
use
to
me
is
to
ride
home
with
day
and
not
see
him
again
until
i
have
had
a
little
talk
with
him
tyranny
may
be
a
sense
of
duty
you
know
little
one
tyranny
uncle
i
cried
as
i
laid
my
cheek
to
his
hand
which
was
very
cold
you
could
not
make
me
think
you
a
tyrant
i
should
not
like
you
to
think
me
one
darling
still
less
would
i
like
to
deserve
it
whether
you
thought
me
one
or
not
but
i
could
not
be
a
tyrant
to
you
if
i
would
you
may
defy
me
when
you
that
would
be
to
poison
my
own
soul
i
answered
you
must
understand
he
continued
that
i
have
no
authority
over
you
if
you
were
going
to
marry
day
i
should
have
no
right
to
interfere
i
am
but
a
father
to
you
not
a
legal
do
cast
me
off
uncle
i
cried
you
i
belong
to
you
as
much
as
if
you
were
my
very
own
father
i
am
sure
my
father
will
say
so
when
we
see
him
he
will
never
come
between
you
and
he
gave
a
great
sigh
and
his
face
grew
so
intense
that
i
felt
as
if
i
had
no
right
to
look
on
it
it
is
one
of
the
deepest
hopes
of
my
existence
he
said
to
give
you
back
to
him
the
best
of
daughters
be
good
my
darling
be
good
even
if
you
die
of
sorrow
because
of
the
intensity
had
faded
to
a
deep
sadness
and
there
came
a
silence
would
you
like
me
to
go
now
uncle
i
asked
i
wish
i
could
see
day
at
once
he
returned
but
i
am
so
far
from
strong
that
i
fear
both
weakness
and
injustice
tell
him
i
want
very
much
to
see
him
and
will
let
him
know
as
soon
as
i
am
thank
you
uncle
he
will
be
so
glad
of
course
he
ca
feel
as
i
do
but
he
does
feel
that
to
do
anything
you
did
not
like
would
be
just
and
you
will
not
see
him
again
little
one
after
he
has
taken
you
home
till
i
have
had
some
talk
with
him
of
course
i
will
not
i
bade
him
had
a
few
moments
conference
with
martha
and
found
john
at
the
place
appointed
chapter
xviii
john
sees
something
as
we
rode
i
told
him
everything
it
did
not
seem
in
the
least
strange
that
i
should
be
so
close
to
one
of
whom
a
few
days
before
i
had
never
heard
it
seemed
as
if
all
my
life
i
had
been
waiting
for
him
and
now
he
was
come
and
everything
was
only
as
it
should
be
we
were
very
quiet
in
our
gladness
some
slight
anxiety
about
my
uncle
decision
and
the
certain
foreboding
of
trouble
on
the
part
of
his
mother
stilled
us
both
sending
the
delight
of
having
found
each
other
a
little
deeper
and
out
of
the
way
of
the
practical
and
reasoning
we
did
not
urge
our
horses
to
their
speed
but
i
felt
that
for
my
uncle
sake
i
must
not
prolong
the
journey
forcing
the
last
farthing
of
bliss
from
his
generosity
while
yet
he
was
uncertain
of
his
duty
the
moon
was
rising
just
as
we
reached
my
home
and
i
was
glad
john
would
have
to
walk
miles
to
reach
his
for
he
absolutely
refused
to
take
death
on
saying
he
did
not
know
what
might
happen
to
him
as
we
stopped
at
the
gate
i
bethought
myself
that
neither
of
us
had
eaten
since
we
left
in
the
afternoon
i
dismounted
and
leaving
him
with
the
horses
got
what
i
could
find
for
him
and
then
roused
dick
who
was
asleep
john
confessed
that
now
i
had
made
him
think
of
it
he
was
hungry
enough
to
eat
anything
less
than
an
ox
we
parted
merrily
but
when
next
we
met
each
confessed
it
had
not
been
without
a
presentiment
of
impending
danger
for
my
part
notwithstanding
the
position
i
had
presumed
to
take
with
john
when
first
he
spoke
of
his
mother
i
was
now
as
distrustful
as
he
and
more
afraid
of
her
much
the
nearest
way
between
the
two
houses
lay
across
the
heath
john
walked
along
eating
the
supper
i
had
given
him
and
now
and
then
casting
a
glance
round
the
horizon
he
had
got
about
when
looking
up
he
thought
he
saw
dim
in
the
ghosty
light
of
the
moon
a
speck
upon
the
track
before
him
he
said
to
himself
it
could
hardly
be
any
one
on
the
moor
at
such
a
time
of
the
night
and
went
on
with
his
supper
looking
up
again
after
an
interval
he
saw
that
the
object
was
much
larger
but
hardly
less
vague
because
of
a
light
fog
which
had
in
the
meantime
risen
by
and
by
however
as
they
drew
nearer
to
each
other
a
strange
thrill
of
recognition
went
through
him
on
the
way
before
him
which
was
little
better
than
a
footpath
and
slowly
approaching
came
what
certainly
could
be
neither
the
horse
that
had
carried
him
that
day
nor
his
double
but
what
was
so
like
him
in
colour
size
and
bone
while
so
unlike
him
in
muscle
and
bearing
that
he
might
have
been
he
worn
but
for
his
skin
to
a
skeleton
straight
down
upon
john
he
came
spectral
through
the
fog
as
if
he
were
asleep
and
saw
nothing
in
his
way
john
stepped
aside
to
let
him
pass
and
then
first
looked
in
the
face
of
his
rider
with
a
shock
of
fear
that
struck
him
in
the
middle
of
the
body
making
him
gasp
and
choke
he
saw
before
him
so
plainly
that
but
for
the
impossibility
he
could
have
sworn
to
him
in
any
court
of
justice
the
man
whom
he
knew
to
be
at
that
moment
confined
to
his
bed
twenty
miles
away
with
a
broken
arm
sole
other
human
being
within
sight
or
sound
in
that
still
moonlight
on
that
desolate
moor
the
horseman
never
lifted
his
head
never
raised
his
eyes
to
look
at
him
john
stood
stunned
he
hardly
doubted
he
saw
an
apparition
when
at
length
he
roused
himself
and
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
it
went
it
had
all
but
vanished
in
the
thickening
white
mist
he
found
the
rest
of
his
way
home
almost
mechanically
and
went
straight
to
bed
but
for
a
long
time
could
not
sleep
for
what
might
not
the
apparition
portend
whichcote
lay
hurt
by
a
fall
from
his
horse
and
he
had
met
his
very
image
on
the
back
of
just
such
a
horse
only
turned
to
a
skeleton
was
he
bearing
him
away
to
the
tomb
then
he
remembered
that
the
horse
name
was
death
chapter
xix
john
is
taken
ill
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
woke
with
a
start
ill
enough
to
feel
that
he
was
going
to
be
worse
his
head
throbbed
the
room
seemed
turning
round
with
him
and
when
it
settled
he
saw
strange
shapes
in
it
a
few
rays
of
the
sinking
moon
had
got
in
between
the
curtains
of
one
of
the
windows
and
had
waked
up
everything
the
furniture
looked
odd
unpleasantly
odd
something
unnatural
or
at
least
unearthly
must
be
near
him
the
room
was
an
one
in
thorough
keeping
with
the
age
of
the
house
the
very
haunt
for
a
ghost
but
he
had
heard
of
no
ghost
in
that
room
he
got
up
to
get
himself
some
water
and
drew
the
curtains
aside
he
could
have
been
in
no
thraldom
to
an
apprehensive
imagination
for
what
man
with
a
brooding
terror
couched
in
him
would
in
the
middle
of
the
night
let
in
the
moon
to
such
a
passion
she
is
worse
than
the
deepest
darkness
especially
when
going
down
as
she
was
then
with
the
weary
look
she
gets
by
the
time
her
work
is
about
over
and
she
has
long
been
forsaken
of
the
poor
mortals
for
whom
she
has
so
often
to
be
up
and
shining
all
night
he
poured
himself
some
water
and
drank
it
but
thought
it
did
not
taste
nice
then
he
turned
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
house
was
in
a
large
park
its
few
trees
served
mainly
to
show
how
wide
the
unbroken
spaces
of
grass
before
the
house
motionless
as
a
statue
stood
a
great
gray
horse
with
hanging
neck
his
shadow
stretched
in
mighty
grotesque
behind
him
and
on
his
back
the
very
effigy
of
my
uncle
motionless
too
as
marble
the
horse
stood
sidewise
to
the
house
but
the
face
of
his
rider
was
turned
toward
it
as
if
scanning
its
windows
in
the
dying
glitter
of
the
moon
john
thought
he
heard
a
cry
somewhere
and
went
to
his
door
but
listening
hard
heard
nothing
when
he
looked
again
from
the
window
the
apparition
seemed
fainter
and
farther
away
though
neither
horse
nor
rider
had
changed
posture
he
rubbed
his
eyes
to
see
more
plainly
could
no
longer
distinguish
the
appearance
and
went
back
to
bed
in
the
morning
he
was
in
a
high
fever
unconscious
save
of
restless
discomfort
and
undefined
trouble
he
learned
afterward
from
the
housekeeper
that
his
mother
herself
nursed
him
but
he
would
take
neither
food
nor
medicine
from
her
hand
no
doctor
was
sent
for
john
thought
and
i
can
not
but
think
that
the
water
in
his
bottle
had
to
do
with
the
sudden
illness
his
mother
may
have
merely
wished
to
prevent
him
from
coming
to
me
but
for
the
time
at
least
the
conviction
had
got
possession
of
him
that
she
was
attempting
his
life
he
may
have
argued
in
semi
conscious
moments
that
she
would
not
scruple
to
take
again
what
she
was
capable
of
imagining
she
had
given
her
attentions
however
may
have
arisen
from
alarm
at
seeing
him
worse
than
she
had
intended
to
make
him
and
desire
to
counteract
what
she
had
done
for
several
days
he
was
prostrate
with
extreme
exhaustion
necessarily
i
knew
nothing
of
this
neither
was
i
notwithstanding
my
more
than
doubt
of
his
mother
in
any
immediate
dread
of
what
she
might
do
the
cessation
of
his
visits
could
of
course
cause
me
no
anxiety
seeing
it
was
thoroughly
understood
between
us
that
we
were
not
at
liberty
to
meet
chapter
xx
a
strange
visit
on
the
fifth
night
after
that
on
which
he
left
me
to
walk
home
i
was
roused
about
two
by
a
sharp
sound
as
of
sudden
hail
against
my
window
ceasing
as
soon
as
it
began
wondering
what
it
was
for
hail
it
could
hardly
be
i
sprang
from
the
bed
pulled
aside
the
curtain
and
looked
out
there
was
light
enough
in
the
moon
to
show
me
a
man
looking
up
at
the
window
and
love
enough
in
my
heart
to
tell
me
who
he
was
how
he
knew
the
window
mine
i
have
always
forgotten
to
ask
him
i
would
have
drawn
back
for
it
vexed
me
sorely
to
think
him
too
weak
to
hold
to
our
agreement
but
the
face
i
looked
down
upon
was
so
ghastly
and
deathlike
that
i
perceived
at
once
his
coming
must
have
its
justification
i
did
not
speak
for
i
would
not
have
any
in
the
house
hear
but
putting
on
my
shoes
and
a
big
cloak
i
went
softly
down
the
stair
opened
the
door
noiselessly
and
ran
to
the
other
side
of
the
house
there
stood
john
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
my
window
as
i
turned
the
corner
i
could
see
by
their
weary
flashing
that
either
something
terrible
had
happened
or
he
was
very
ill
he
stood
motionless
unaware
of
my
approach
what
is
it
i
said
under
my
breath
putting
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
he
did
not
turn
his
head
or
answer
me
but
grew
yet
whiter
gasped
and
seemed
ready
to
fall
i
put
my
arm
round
him
and
his
head
sank
on
the
top
of
mine
whatever
might
be
the
matter
the
first
thing
was
to
get
him
into
the
house
and
make
him
lie
down
i
moved
a
little
holding
him
fast
and
mechanically
he
followed
his
support
so
that
although
with
some
difficulty
i
soon
got
him
round
the
house
and
into
the
great
our
usual
there
was
fire
there
that
would
only
want
rousing
and
warm
as
was
the
night
i
felt
him
very
cold
i
let
him
sink
on
the
wide
sofa
covered
him
with
my
cloak
and
ran
to
rouse
old
penny
the
aged
sleep
lightly
and
she
was
up
in
an
instant
i
told
her
that
a
gentleman
i
knew
had
come
to
the
house
either
or
delirious
and
she
must
come
and
help
me
with
him
she
struck
a
light
and
followed
me
to
the
kitchen
john
lay
with
his
eyes
closed
in
a
dead
faint
we
got
him
to
swallow
some
brandy
and
presently
he
came
to
himself
a
little
then
we
put
him
in
my
warm
bed
and
covered
him
with
blankets
in
a
minute
or
so
he
was
fast
asleep
he
had
not
spoken
a
word
i
left
penny
to
watch
him
and
went
and
dressed
myself
thinking
hard
the
result
was
that
having
enjoined
penny
to
let
no
one
near
him
it
might
be
i
went
to
the
stable
saddled
zoe
and
set
off
for
wittenage
it
was
sixteen
miles
of
a
ride
the
moon
went
down
and
the
last
of
my
journey
was
very
dark
for
the
night
was
cloudy
but
we
arrived
in
safety
just
as
the
dawn
was
promising
to
come
as
soon
as
it
could
no
one
in
the
town
seemed
up
or
thinking
of
getting
up
i
had
learned
a
lesson
from
john
however
and
i
knew
martha
window
which
happily
looked
on
the
street
i
got
off
zoe
who
was
tired
enough
to
stand
still
for
she
was
getting
old
and
i
had
not
spared
her
and
proceeded
to
search
for
a
stone
small
enough
to
throw
at
the
window
the
scared
face
of
martha
showed
itself
almost
immediately
it
me
i
cried
no
louder
than
she
could
just
hear
it
me
martha
come
down
and
let
me
without
a
word
of
reply
she
left
the
window
and
after
some
fumbling
with
the
lock
opened
the
door
and
came
out
to
me
looking
gray
with
scare
but
none
the
less
with
all
her
wits
to
her
hand
how
is
my
uncle
martha
i
said
much
better
she
answered
then
i
must
see
him
at
once
he
fast
asleep
child
it
would
be
a
world
pity
to
wake
him
it
would
be
a
worse
pity
not
i
returned
very
well
must
she
answered
i
made
zoe
fast
to
the
the
night
was
warm
and
hot
as
she
was
she
would
take
no
hurt
then
i
followed
martha
up
the
stair
but
my
uncle
was
awake
he
had
heard
a
little
of
our
motions
and
whisperings
and
lay
in
expectation
of
something
i
thought
i
should
hear
from
you
soon
he
said
i
wrote
to
day
on
thursday
but
have
had
no
reply
what
has
happened
nothing
serious
i
hope
i
hardly
know
uncle
john
day
is
lying
at
our
house
unable
to
move
or
my
uncle
started
up
as
if
to
spring
from
his
bed
but
fell
back
again
with
a
groan
do
be
alarmed
uncle
i
said
he
is
i
hope
safe
for
the
moment
with
penny
to
watch
him
but
i
am
very
anxious
southwell
should
see
how
did
it
come
about
little
one
there
has
been
no
accident
that
i
know
of
but
i
scarcely
know
more
than
you
i
replied
and
told
him
all
that
had
taken
place
within
my
ken
he
lay
silent
a
moment
thinking
i
ca
say
i
like
his
lying
there
with
only
penny
to
protect
him
he
said
he
must
have
come
seeking
refuge
i
do
like
the
thing
at
all
he
is
in
some
danger
we
do
not
know
i
will
go
back
at
once
uncle
i
replied
and
rose
from
the
bedside
where
i
had
seated
myself
a
little
tired
you
must
if
we
can
not
do
better
but
i
think
we
can
martha
shall
go
and
you
will
stay
with
me
run
at
once
and
wake
southwell
ask
him
to
come
i
ran
all
the
way
it
was
not
far
and
pulled
the
doctor
he
answered
it
himself
i
gave
him
my
uncle
message
and
he
was
at
the
inn
a
few
minutes
after
me
my
uncle
told
him
what
had
happened
and
begged
him
to
go
and
see
the
patient
carrying
martha
with
him
in
his
gig
the
doctor
said
he
would
start
at
once
my
uncle
begged
him
to
give
strictest
orders
that
no
one
was
to
see
day
whoever
it
might
be
martha
heard
and
grew
like
a
colonel
of
dragoons
ordered
to
charge
with
his
regiment
in
less
than
half
an
hour
they
started
at
a
pace
that
delighted
me
when
zoe
was
put
up
and
attended
to
and
i
was
alone
with
my
uncle
i
got
him
some
breakfast
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
his
sleep
he
told
me
it
was
better
than
sleep
to
have
me
near
him
what
i
went
through
that
night
and
the
following
day
i
need
not
recount
whoever
has
loved
one
in
danger
and
out
of
her
reach
will
know
what
it
was
like
the
doctor
did
not
make
his
appearance
until
five
having
seen
several
patients
on
his
way
back
the
young
man
he
reported
was
certainly
in
for
a
fever
of
some
kind
could
not
yet
pronounce
which
he
would
see
him
again
on
the
morrow
he
said
and
by
that
time
it
would
have
declared
itself
some
one
in
the
neighbourhood
must
watch
the
case
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
give
it
sufficient
attention
my
uncle
told
him
he
was
now
quite
equal
to
the
task
himself
and
we
would
all
go
together
the
next
day
my
delight
at
the
proposal
was
almost
equalled
by
my
satisfaction
that
the
doctor
made
no
objection
to
it
for
joy
i
scarcely
slept
that
night
i
was
going
to
nurse
john
but
i
was
anxious
about
my
uncle
he
assured
me
however
that
in
one
day
more
he
would
in
any
case
have
insisted
on
returning
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
little
lingering
fever
he
said
he
would
have
gone
much
sooner
that
was
because
of
me
uncle
i
answered
with
contrition
perhaps
he
replied
but
i
had
a
blow
on
the
head
you
know
there
is
one
good
thing
i
said
you
will
know
john
the
sooner
from
seeing
him
ill
but
perhaps
you
will
count
that
only
a
mood
uncle
and
not
to
be
trusted
he
smiled
i
think
he
was
not
anxious
about
the
result
of
a
nearer
acquaintance
with
john
day
i
believe
he
had
some
faith
in
my
spiritual
instinct
uncle
went
with
the
doctor
in
his
brougham
and
i
rode
zoe
the
back
of
the
house
came
first
in
sight
and
i
saw
the
of
my
room
still
down
the
doctor
had
pronounced
it
the
fittest
for
the
invalid
and
would
not
have
him
moved
to
the
penny
had
prepared
for
him
in
the
only
room
i
had
ever
occupied
as
my
own
i
nursed
john
for
a
space
of
three
weeks
from
the
moment
he
saw
me
he
began
to
improve
my
uncle
noted
this
and
i
fancy
liked
john
the
better
for
it
nor
did
he
fail
to
note
the
gentleness
and
gratitude
of
the
invalid
chapter
xxi
a
foiled
attempt
the
morning
after
my
uncle
return
came
a
messenger
from
rising
with
his
lady
compliments
asking
if
whichcote
could
tell
her
anything
of
her
son
he
had
left
the
house
unseen
during
a
feverish
attack
and
as
she
could
get
no
tidings
of
him
she
was
in
great
anxiety
she
had
accidentally
heard
that
he
had
made
whichcote
acquaintance
and
therefore
took
the
liberty
of
extending
to
him
the
inquiry
she
had
already
made
everywhere
else
among
his
friends
my
uncle
wrote
in
answer
that
her
son
had
come
to
his
house
in
a
high
fever
that
he
had
been
under
medical
care
ever
since
and
that
he
hoped
in
a
day
or
two
he
might
be
able
to
return
if
he
expressed
a
desire
to
see
his
mother
he
would
immediately
let
her
know
but
in
the
meantime
it
was
imperative
he
should
be
kept
quiet
from
this
letter
lady
cairnedge
might
surmise
that
her
relations
with
her
son
were
at
least
suspected
within
two
hours
came
another
message
that
she
would
send
a
close
carriage
to
bring
him
home
the
next
day
then
indeed
were
my
uncle
and
i
glad
that
we
had
come
for
though
martha
would
certainly
have
defended
the
citadel
to
her
utmost
she
might
have
been
sorely
put
to
it
if
his
mother
proceeded
to
carry
him
away
by
force
my
uncle
in
reply
begged
her
not
to
give
herself
the
useless
trouble
of
sending
to
fetch
him
in
the
state
he
was
in
at
present
it
would
be
tantamount
to
murder
to
remove
him
and
he
would
not
be
a
party
to
it
when
i
yielded
my
place
in
the
to
martha
and
went
to
bed
my
heart
was
not
only
at
ease
for
the
night
but
i
feared
nothing
for
the
next
day
with
my
uncle
on
my
side
or
rather
on
john
side
we
were
just
rising
from
our
early
dinner
for
we
were
people
when
up
drove
a
grand
carriage
with
two
strong
footmen
behind
and
a
servant
in
plain
clothes
on
the
box
by
the
coachman
it
pulled
up
at
the
door
and
the
man
on
the
box
got
down
and
rang
the
bell
while
his
fellows
behind
got
down
also
and
stood
together
a
little
way
behind
him
my
uncle
at
once
went
to
the
hall
but
no
more
than
in
time
for
there
was
penny
already
on
her
way
to
open
the
door
he
opened
it
himself
and
stood
on
the
threshold
if
you
please
sir
said
the
man
not
without
arrogance
we
come
to
take
day
tell
your
mistress
returned
my
uncle
that
day
has
expressed
no
desire
to
return
and
is
much
too
unwell
to
be
informed
of
her
begging
your
pardon
sir
said
the
man
we
have
her
ladyship
orders
to
bring
him
we
take
every
possible
care
of
him
the
carriage
is
an
one
and
i
sit
inside
with
the
young
gentleman
myself
if
he
ai
right
in
his
head
he
never
know
nothink
till
he
comes
to
himself
in
his
own
my
uncle
had
let
the
man
talk
but
his
anger
was
fast
rising
i
can
not
let
him
go
i
would
not
send
a
beggar
to
the
hospital
in
the
state
he
is
but
indeed
sir
you
must
we
have
our
if
you
fancy
i
will
dismiss
a
guest
of
mine
at
the
order
of
any
human
being
were
it
the
queen
own
majesty
said
my
uncle
i
heard
the
words
and
with
my
mind
eyes
saw
the
blue
flash
of
his
as
he
said
them
you
will
find
yourself
i
sorry
said
the
man
quietly
but
i
have
my
orders
let
me
pass
please
it
is
my
business
to
find
the
young
gentleman
and
take
him
home
no
one
can
have
the
right
to
keep
him
against
his
mother
will
especially
when
he
not
in
a
fit
state
to
judge
for
happily
i
am
in
a
fit
state
to
judge
for
him
said
my
uncle
coldly
i
dare
not
go
back
without
him
let
me
pass
he
returned
raising
his
voice
a
little
and
approaching
the
door
as
if
he
would
force
his
way
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
that
as
my
uncle
went
to
the
door
he
took
from
a
rack
in
the
hall
a
whip
with
a
bamboo
stock
which
he
generally
carried
when
he
rode
his
answer
to
the
man
was
a
smart
though
blow
with
the
stock
across
his
face
they
were
too
near
for
the
thong
he
staggered
back
and
stood
holding
his
hand
to
his
face
his
who
during
the
colloquy
had
looked
on
with
gentlemanlike
imperturbability
made
a
simultaneous
step
forward
my
uncle
sent
the
thong
with
a
hiss
about
their
ears
they
sprang
toward
him
in
a
fury
but
halted
immediately
and
recoiled
he
had
drawn
a
small
swordlike
weapon
which
i
did
not
know
to
be
there
from
the
stock
of
the
whip
he
gave
one
swift
glance
behind
him
i
was
in
the
hall
at
his
back
shut
the
door
orba
he
cried
i
shut
him
out
and
ran
to
a
window
in
the
little
which
commanded
the
door
never
had
i
seen
him
look
as
now
his
pale
face
pale
no
longer
but
flushed
with
anger
neither
indeed
until
that
moment
had
i
ever
seen
the
look
of
anger
the
expression
of
anger
there
was
nothing
mean
or
ugly
in
it
not
an
atom
of
hate
but
how
his
eyes
blazed
go
back
he
cried
in
a
voice
far
more
stern
than
loud
if
one
of
you
set
foot
on
the
lowest
step
and
i
will
run
him
the
men
saw
he
meant
it
they
saw
the
closed
door
and
my
uncle
with
his
back
to
it
they
turned
and
spoke
to
each
other
the
coachman
sat
immovable
on
his
box
they
mounted
and
he
drove
away
i
ran
and
opened
the
door
my
uncle
came
in
with
a
smile
he
went
up
the
stair
and
i
followed
him
to
the
room
where
the
invalid
lay
we
were
both
anxious
to
learn
if
he
had
been
disturbed
he
was
leaning
on
his
elbow
listening
he
looked
a
good
deal
more
like
himself
i
knew
you
would
defend
me
sir
he
said
with
a
respectful
confidence
which
could
not
but
please
my
uncle
you
did
not
want
to
go
home
did
you
he
asked
with
a
smile
i
should
have
thrown
myself
out
of
the
carriage
answered
john
that
is
if
they
had
got
me
into
it
but
please
tell
me
sir
he
went
on
how
it
is
i
find
myself
in
your
house
i
have
been
puzzling
over
it
all
the
morning
i
have
no
recollection
of
you
understand
i
fancy
rejoined
my
uncle
that
one
of
the
family
has
a
notion
she
can
take
better
care
of
you
than
anybody
else
is
not
that
enough
to
account
for
it
hardly
sir
belorba
can
not
have
gone
and
rescued
me
from
my
mother
how
do
you
know
that
belorba
is
a
terrible
creature
when
she
is
roused
but
you
have
talked
enough
shut
your
eyes
and
do
trouble
yourself
to
recollect
as
you
get
stronger
it
will
all
come
back
to
you
then
you
will
be
able
to
tell
us
instead
of
asking
us
to
tell
he
left
us
together
i
quieted
john
by
reading
to
him
and
absolutely
declining
to
talk
you
are
a
captive
the
castle
is
enchanted
speak
a
single
word
i
said
and
you
will
find
yourself
in
the
dungeon
of
your
own
he
looked
at
me
an
instant
closed
his
eyes
and
in
a
few
minutes
was
fast
asleep
he
slept
for
two
hours
and
when
he
woke
was
quite
himself
he
was
very
weak
but
the
fever
was
gone
and
we
had
now
only
to
feed
him
up
and
keep
him
quiet
chapter
xxii
john
recalls
and
remembers
what
a
weight
was
off
my
heart
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
more
could
go
wrong
but
though
john
was
plainly
happy
he
was
not
quite
comfortable
he
worried
himself
with
trying
to
remember
how
he
had
come
to
us
the
last
thing
he
could
definitely
recall
before
finding
himself
with
us
was
his
mother
looking
at
him
through
a
night
that
seemed
made
of
blackness
so
solid
that
he
marvelled
she
could
move
in
it
she
brought
him
something
to
drink
but
he
fancied
it
blood
and
would
not
touch
it
he
remembered
now
that
there
was
a
red
tumbler
in
his
room
he
could
recall
nothing
after
except
a
cold
wind
and
a
sense
of
utter
weariness
but
absolute
compulsion
he
must
keep
on
and
on
till
he
found
the
gate
of
heaven
to
which
he
seemed
only
for
ever
coming
nearer
his
conclusion
was
that
he
knew
what
he
was
about
every
individual
moment
but
had
no
memory
each
thing
he
did
was
immediately
forgotten
while
the
knowledge
of
what
he
had
to
do
next
remained
with
him
it
was
he
thought
a
mental
condition
analogous
with
walking
in
which
every
step
is
a
frustrated
fall
i
set
this
down
here
because
when
i
told
my
uncle
what
john
had
been
saying
myself
not
sure
that
i
perceived
what
he
meant
he
declared
the
boy
a
philosopher
of
the
finest
grain
but
he
warned
me
not
to
encourage
his
talking
and
especially
not
to
ask
him
to
explain
there
was
nothing
he
said
worse
for
a
weak
brain
than
to
set
a
strong
will
to
work
it
i
tried
to
obey
him
but
it
grew
harder
as
the
days
went
on
there
were
not
many
of
them
however
he
recovered
rapidly
when
at
length
my
uncle
talked
not
only
to
but
with
him
i
regarded
it
as
a
virtual
withdrawal
of
his
prohibition
and
after
that
spoke
to
john
of
whatever
came
into
his
or
my
head
it
was
then
he
told
me
all
he
could
remember
since
the
moment
he
left
me
with
his
supper
in
his
hand
a
great
part
of
his
recollection
was
the
vision
of
my
uncle
on
the
moor
and
afterward
in
the
park
we
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
i
should
at
once
have
concluded
it
caused
by
prelusive
illness
but
for
my
remembrance
of
what
both
my
uncle
and
myself
had
seen
so
long
before
in
the
thunderstorm
while
john
willing
enough
to
attribute
its
recurrence
to
that
cause
found
it
impossible
to
concede
that
he
was
anything
but
well
when
crossing
the
moor
i
thought
however
that
excitement
fatigue
and
lack
of
food
might
have
something
to
do
with
it
and
with
his
illness
too
while
if
he
was
in
a
state
to
see
anything
phantasmal
what
shape
more
likely
to
appear
than
that
of
my
uncle
he
would
not
hear
of
my
mentioning
the
thing
to
my
uncle
i
would
for
my
own
part
have
gone
to
him
with
it
immediately
but
could
not
with
prayer
in
my
ears
i
resolved
however
to
gain
his
consent
if
i
could
he
had
by
this
time
as
great
a
respect
for
my
uncle
as
i
had
myself
but
could
not
feel
at
home
with
him
as
i
did
whether
the
vision
was
only
a
vision
or
indeed
my
uncle
double
whatever
a
double
may
be
the
tale
of
it
could
hardly
be
an
agreeable
one
to
him
and
naturally
john
shrank
from
the
risk
of
causing
him
the
least
annoyance
the
question
of
course
came
up
what
he
was
to
do
when
able
to
leave
us
he
had
spoken
very
plainly
to
my
uncle
concerning
his
relations
with
his
mother
had
told
him
indeed
that
he
could
not
help
suspecting
he
owed
his
illness
to
her
i
was
nearly
always
present
when
they
talked
but
remember
in
especial
a
part
of
what
passed
on
one
occasion
i
believe
i
understand
my
mother
said
john
but
only
after
much
thinking
i
loved
her
when
a
child
and
if
she
had
not
left
me
for
the
sake
of
liberty
and
influence
that
at
least
is
how
i
account
for
her
doing
so
i
might
at
this
moment
be
struggling
for
personal
freedom
instead
of
having
that
there
are
women
returned
my
uncle
some
of
them
of
the
most
admired
who
are
slaves
to
a
demoniacal
love
of
power
the
very
pleasure
of
their
consciousness
consists
in
the
knowledge
that
they
have
power
not
power
to
do
things
but
power
to
make
other
people
do
things
it
is
an
insanity
but
a
devilishly
immoral
and
hateful
i
do
not
say
the
lady
in
question
is
one
of
such
for
i
do
not
know
her
i
only
say
i
have
known
such
a
john
replied
that
certainly
the
love
of
power
was
his
mother
special
weakness
she
was
spoiled
when
a
child
he
had
been
told
had
her
every
wish
regarded
her
every
whim
respected
this
ruinous
treatment
sprang
he
said
from
the
ambition
in
another
form
on
the
part
of
her
mother
the
longing
namely
to
secure
her
child
supreme
affection
with
the
natural
consequence
that
they
came
to
hate
one
another
his
father
and
she
had
been
married
but
fifteen
months
when
he
died
of
a
fall
following
the
hounds
within
six
months
she
was
engaged
but
the
engagement
was
broken
off
and
she
went
abroad
leaving
him
behind
her
she
married
lord
cairnedge
in
venice
and
returned
to
england
when
john
was
nearly
four
and
seemed
to
have
lost
all
memory
of
her
his
stepfather
was
good
to
him
but
died
when
he
was
about
eight
his
mother
was
very
severe
her
object
plainly
was
to
plant
her
authority
so
in
his
very
nature
that
he
should
never
think
of
disputing
her
will
but
said
john
she
killed
my
love
and
so
i
grew
able
to
cast
off
her
the
world
would
fare
worse
i
fancy
remarked
my
uncle
if
violent
women
bore
patient
children
the
evil
would
become
irremediable
the
children
might
not
be
ruined
but
they
would
bring
no
discipline
to
the
mother
her
servants
continued
john
obey
her
implicitly
except
when
they
are
sure
she
will
never
know
she
treats
them
so
imperiously
that
they
admire
her
and
are
proud
to
have
such
a
mistress
but
she
is
convinced
at
last
i
believe
that
she
will
never
get
me
to
do
as
she
pleases
and
therefore
hates
me
so
heartily
that
she
can
hardly
keep
her
ladylike
hands
off
me
i
do
not
think
i
have
been
unreasonable
i
have
not
found
it
difficult
to
obey
others
that
were
set
over
me
but
when
i
found
almost
her
every
requirement
part
of
a
system
for
reducing
me
to
a
slavish
obedience
i
began
to
lay
down
lines
of
my
own
i
resolved
to
do
at
once
whatever
she
asked
me
whether
pleasant
to
me
or
not
so
long
as
i
saw
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
done
then
i
was
surprised
to
find
how
seldom
i
had
to
make
a
stand
against
her
wishes
at
the
same
time
the
mode
in
which
she
conveyed
her
pleasure
was
invariably
such
as
to
make
a
pretty
strong
effort
of
the
will
necessary
for
compliance
with
it
but
the
effort
to
overcome
the
difficulty
caused
by
her
manner
helped
to
develop
in
me
the
strength
to
resist
where
it
was
not
right
to
yield
by
far
the
most
serious
difference
we
had
yet
had
arose
about
six
months
ago
when
she
insisted
i
should
make
myself
agreeable
to
a
certain
lady
whom
i
by
no
means
disliked
she
had
planned
our
marriage
i
believe
as
one
of
her
parallels
in
the
siege
of
the
lady
noble
father
then
a
widower
of
a
year
i
told
her
i
would
not
lay
myself
out
to
please
any
lady
except
i
wanted
to
marry
her
why
pray
should
you
not
marry
her
she
returned
i
answered
that
i
did
not
love
her
and
would
not
marry
until
i
saw
the
woman
i
could
not
be
happy
without
and
she
accepted
me
she
went
into
a
terrible
passion
but
i
found
myself
quite
unmoved
by
it
it
is
a
wonderful
heartener
to
know
yourself
not
merely
standing
up
for
a
right
but
for
the
right
to
do
the
right
thing
would
surely
have
me
marry
a
woman
i
did
care
a
straw
for
i
said
my
soul
she
cried
i
have
often
wondered
where
she
learned
the
oath
would
that
matter
she
would
care
a
straw
for
you
in
a
month
should
i
marry
her
then
your
mother
wishes
it
she
replied
and
turned
to
march
from
the
room
as
if
that
settled
the
thing
but
i
could
not
leave
it
so
the
sooner
she
understood
the
better
i
cried
will
not
marry
the
lady
i
will
not
pay
her
the
least
attention
that
could
be
mistaken
to
mean
the
possibility
of
it
she
turned
upon
me
i
have
just
respect
enough
left
for
her
not
to
say
what
her
face
suggested
to
me
she
was
pale
as
a
corpse
her
very
lips
were
colourless
her
eyes
but
i
will
not
go
on
father
all
over
she
snarled
yes
snarled
with
an
inarticulate
cry
of
fiercest
loathing
and
turned
again
and
went
if
i
do
not
quite
think
my
mother
would
murder
me
i
do
think
she
would
do
anything
short
of
murder
to
gain
her
ends
with
me
but
do
not
be
afraid
i
am
sufficiently
afraid
to
be
on
my
guard
my
father
was
a
rich
man
and
left
my
mother
more
than
enough
there
was
no
occasion
for
her
to
marry
again
except
she
loved
and
i
am
sure
she
did
not
love
lord
cairnedge
i
wish
for
my
sake
not
for
his
he
were
alive
now
but
the
moment
i
am
one
and
twenty
i
shall
be
my
own
master
and
hope
sir
you
will
not
count
me
unworthy
to
be
the
more
servant
one
thing
i
am
determined
upon
my
mother
shall
not
cross
my
threshold
but
at
my
wife
invitation
and
i
shall
never
ask
my
wife
to
invite
her
she
is
too
dangerous
we
had
another
altercation
about
miss
miles
an
hour
or
two
before
i
first
saw
orba
they
were
far
from
worthy
feelings
that
possessed
me
up
to
the
moment
when
i
caught
sight
of
her
over
the
wall
it
was
a
leap
out
of
hell
into
paradise
the
glimpse
of
such
a
face
without
shadow
of
scheme
or
plan
or
selfish
end
was
salvation
to
me
i
thank
god
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
let
those
words
about
myself
stand
but
he
said
them
he
had
talked
too
long
he
fell
back
in
his
chair
and
the
tears
began
to
gather
in
his
eyes
my
uncle
rose
put
his
arm
about
me
and
led
me
to
the
study
let
him
rest
a
bit
little
one
he
said
as
we
entered
it
is
long
since
we
had
a
good
talk
he
seated
himself
in
his
a
name
which
when
a
child
i
had
given
it
and
i
slid
to
the
floor
at
his
feet
i
can
not
help
thinking
little
one
he
began
that
you
are
going
to
be
a
happy
woman
i
do
believe
that
is
a
man
to
be
trusted
as
for
the
mother
there
is
no
occasion
to
think
of
her
beyond
being
on
your
guard
against
her
you
will
have
no
trouble
with
her
after
you
are
i
can
not
help
fearing
she
will
do
us
a
mischief
uncle
i
returned
sir
philip
sidney
says
a
man
is
bound
no
further
to
himself
than
to
do
wisely
chance
is
only
to
trouble
them
that
stand
upon
chance
that
is
we
are
responsible
only
for
our
actions
not
for
their
results
trust
first
in
god
then
in
john
i
was
sure
you
would
like
him
uncle
i
cried
with
a
flutter
of
loving
triumph
i
was
nearly
as
sure
myself
such
confidence
had
i
in
the
instinct
of
my
little
one
i
think
that
i
of
the
two
of
us
may
in
this
instance
claim
the
greater
faith
you
are
always
before
me
uncle
i
said
i
only
follow
where
you
lead
but
what
do
you
think
the
woman
will
do
next
i
do
think
it
is
no
use
we
shall
hear
of
her
before
long
if
all
mothers
were
like
her
the
world
would
hardly
be
saved
it
would
not
be
worth
saving
whatever
can
be
saved
must
be
worth
saving
my
yes
uncle
i
should
have
said
that
i
replied
chapter
xxiii
letter
and
answer
we
did
hear
of
her
before
long
the
next
morning
a
letter
was
handed
to
my
uncle
as
we
sat
at
breakfast
he
looked
hard
at
the
address
changed
countenance
and
frowned
very
dark
but
i
could
not
read
the
frown
then
his
face
cleared
a
little
he
opened
read
and
handed
the
letter
to
me
lady
cairnedge
hoped
whichcote
would
excuse
one
who
had
so
lately
come
to
the
neighbourhood
that
until
an
hour
ago
she
knew
nothing
of
the
position
and
character
of
the
gentleman
in
whose
house
her
son
had
in
a
momentary
but
alas
not
unusual
aberration
sought
shelter
and
found
generous
hospitality
she
apologized
heartily
for
the
unceremonious
way
in
which
she
had
sent
for
him
in
her
anxiety
to
have
him
home
if
possible
before
he
should
realize
his
awkward
position
in
the
house
of
a
stranger
she
had
been
inconsiderate
she
left
it
to
the
judgment
of
his
kind
host
whether
she
should
herself
come
to
fetch
him
or
send
her
carriage
with
the
medical
man
who
usually
attended
him
in
either
case
her
servants
must
accompany
the
carriage
as
he
would
probably
object
to
being
removed
he
might
however
be
perfectly
manageable
for
he
was
when
himself
the
gentlest
creature
in
the
world
i
was
in
a
rage
i
looked
up
expecting
to
see
my
uncle
as
indignant
with
the
diabolical
woman
as
i
was
myself
but
he
seemed
sunk
in
reverie
his
body
present
his
spirit
far
away
a
pang
shot
through
my
heart
could
the
wicked
device
have
told
already
may
i
ask
uncle
i
said
and
tried
hard
to
keep
my
voice
steady
how
you
mean
to
answer
this
vile
epistle
he
looked
up
with
a
wan
smile
such
as
might
have
broke
from
lazarus
when
he
found
himself
again
in
his
body
i
will
take
it
to
the
young
man
he
answered
please
let
us
go
at
once
then
uncle
i
can
not
sit
he
rose
and
we
went
together
to
john
room
he
was
much
better
sitting
up
in
bed
and
eating
the
breakfast
penny
had
carried
him
i
have
just
had
a
letter
from
your
mother
day
said
my
uncle
indeed
returned
john
dryly
will
you
read
it
and
tell
me
what
answer
you
would
like
me
to
hardly
like
her
usual
writing
though
there
her
own
strange
s
remarked
john
as
he
looked
at
it
does
she
always
make
an
s
like
that
asked
my
uncle
with
something
peculiar
in
his
tone
i
thought
always
like
a
snake
just
going
to
my
uncle
face
grew
ghastly
pale
he
almost
snatched
the
letter
from
john
hand
looked
at
it
gave
it
back
to
him
and
to
our
dismay
left
the
room
what
can
be
the
matter
john
i
said
my
heart
sinking
within
me
go
to
him
said
john
i
dared
not
i
had
often
seen
him
that
before
walking
out
into
the
night
but
there
was
something
in
his
face
now
which
i
had
not
seen
there
before
it
looked
as
if
some
terrible
suspicion
were
suddenly
confirmed
you
see
what
my
mother
is
after
said
john
you
have
now
to
believe
that
i
am
subject
to
fits
of
insanity
or
to
believe
that
there
is
nothing
she
will
not
do
to
get
her
her
object
is
clear
i
replied
but
if
she
thinks
to
fool
my
uncle
she
will
find
herself
mistaken
she
hopes
to
fool
both
you
and
your
uncle
he
rejoined
the
only
wise
thing
i
could
do
she
will
handle
so
as
to
convince
any
expert
of
my
madness
i
mean
my
coming
to
you
my
reasons
will
go
for
nothing
less
than
with
any
one
she
chooses
to
bewitch
she
will
look
at
me
with
an
anxious
love
no
doctor
could
doubt
no
one
can
know
do
not
know
that
i
am
not
mad
or
at
least
subject
to
attacks
of
madness
oh
john
do
frighten
me
i
cried
there
you
are
not
sure
about
it
it
seemed
cruel
of
him
to
tease
me
so
but
i
saw
presently
why
he
did
it
he
thought
his
mother
letter
had
waked
a
doubt
in
my
uncle
and
he
wanted
me
not
to
be
vexed
with
my
uncle
even
if
he
deserted
him
and
went
over
to
his
mother
side
i
love
your
uncle
he
said
i
know
he
is
a
true
man
i
not
be
angry
with
him
if
my
mother
do
mislead
him
the
time
will
come
when
he
will
know
the
truth
it
must
appear
at
last
i
shall
have
to
fight
her
alone
that
all
the
worst
is
if
he
thinks
with
my
mother
i
shall
have
to
go
at
once
if
only
somebody
would
sell
my
horse
for
me
i
guessed
that
his
mother
kept
him
short
of
money
and
remembered
with
gladness
that
i
was
not
quite
penniless
at
the
moment
in
the
meantime
you
must
keep
as
quiet
as
you
can
john
i
said
where
is
the
good
of
planning
upon
an
to
trust
is
to
get
ready
uncle
says
trust
is
better
than
john
required
little
such
persuading
and
indeed
something
very
different
was
in
my
uncle
mind
from
what
john
feared
presently
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
riding
out
of
the
yard
i
ran
to
a
window
from
which
i
could
see
the
edge
of
the
moor
and
saw
him
cross
it
at
an
uphill
gallop
he
was
gone
about
four
hours
and
on
his
return
went
straight
to
his
own
room
not
until
nine
did
i
go
to
him
and
then
he
came
with
me
to
supper
he
looked
worn
but
was
kind
and
genial
as
usual
after
supper
he
sent
for
dick
and
told
him
to
ride
to
rising
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
with
a
letter
he
would
find
on
the
the
letter
he
read
to
us
before
we
parted
for
the
night
it
was
all
we
could
have
wished
he
wrote
that
he
must
not
have
any
one
in
his
house
interfered
with
so
long
as
a
man
was
his
guest
he
was
his
servant
her
ladyship
had
however
a
perfect
right
to
see
her
son
and
would
be
welcome
only
the
decision
as
to
his
going
or
remaining
must
rest
with
the
young
man
himself
if
he
chose
to
accompany
his
mother
well
and
good
though
he
should
be
sorry
to
lose
him
if
he
declined
to
return
with
her
he
and
his
house
continued
at
his
service
chapter
xxiv
hand
to
hand
we
looked
for
lady
cairnedge
all
the
next
day
john
was
up
by
noon
and
ready
to
receive
her
in
the
he
would
not
see
her
in
his
bedroom
but
the
hours
passed
and
she
did
not
come
in
the
evening
however
when
the
twilight
was
thickening
and
already
all
was
dark
in
the
alleys
of
the
garden
her
carriage
drove
quietly
up
with
a
startling
scramble
of
arrest
at
the
door
the
same
servants
were
outside
and
a
very
handsome
dame
within
as
she
descended
i
saw
that
she
was
tall
and
if
rather
stout
not
stouter
than
suited
her
age
and
style
her
face
was
pale
but
she
seemed
in
perfect
health
when
i
saw
her
closer
i
found
her
features
the
most
regular
i
had
ever
seen
had
the
soul
within
it
filled
the
mould
of
that
face
it
would
have
been
beautiful
as
it
was
it
was
only
handsome
to
me
repulsive
the
moment
i
saw
it
i
knew
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
masked
battery
my
uncle
had
insisted
that
she
should
be
received
where
we
usually
sat
and
had
given
penny
orders
to
show
her
into
the
i
was
alone
there
preparing
something
for
john
we
were
not
expecting
her
for
it
seemed
now
too
late
to
look
for
her
my
uncle
was
in
the
study
and
martha
somewhere
about
the
house
my
heart
sank
as
i
turned
from
the
window
and
sank
yet
lower
when
she
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
kitchen
but
as
i
advanced
i
caught
sight
of
my
uncle
and
went
boldly
to
meet
the
enemy
he
had
come
down
his
stair
and
had
just
stepped
into
a
clear
blaze
of
light
which
that
moment
burst
from
the
wood
i
had
some
time
ago
laid
damp
upon
the
fire
the
next
instant
i
saw
the
lady
countenance
ghastly
with
terror
looking
beyond
me
i
turned
but
saw
nothing
save
that
my
uncle
had
disappeared
when
i
faced
her
again
only
a
shadow
of
her
fright
remained
i
offered
her
my
hand
for
she
was
john
mother
but
she
did
not
take
it
she
stood
scanning
me
from
head
to
foot
i
am
lady
cairnedge
she
said
where
is
my
son
i
turned
yet
again
my
uncle
had
not
come
back
i
was
not
prepared
to
take
his
part
i
was
bewildered
a
dead
silence
fell
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
my
uncle
seemed
to
have
deserted
me
and
at
the
moment
when
most
i
needed
him
i
turned
once
more
to
the
lady
and
said
hardly
knowing
what
you
wish
to
see
day
she
answered
me
with
a
cold
stare
i
will
go
and
tell
him
you
are
here
i
faltered
and
passing
her
i
sped
along
the
passage
to
the
john
i
cried
bursting
in
she
come
do
you
still
mean
to
see
her
are
you
able
uncle
there
i
stopped
for
his
eyes
were
stern
and
not
looking
at
me
but
at
something
behind
me
one
moment
i
thought
his
fever
had
returned
but
following
his
gaze
i
looked
round
there
stood
lady
cairnedge
john
was
face
to
face
with
his
mother
and
my
uncle
was
not
there
to
defend
him
are
you
ready
she
said
nor
pretended
greeting
she
seemed
slightly
discomposed
and
in
haste
i
was
by
this
time
well
aware
of
my
lover
determination
of
character
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
the
tone
in
which
he
addressed
the
icy
woman
calling
herself
his
mother
i
am
ready
to
listen
he
answered
john
she
returned
with
mingled
severity
and
sharpness
let
us
have
no
masquerading
you
are
perfectly
fit
to
come
home
and
you
must
come
at
once
the
carriage
is
at
the
you
are
quite
right
mother
answered
john
calmly
i
fit
to
go
home
with
you
but
rising
does
not
quite
agree
with
me
i
dread
such
another
attack
and
do
not
mean
to
the
had
a
rectangular
one
of
whose
three
sides
commanded
the
door
the
opposite
side
looked
into
a
little
grove
of
larches
lady
cairnedge
had
already
realized
the
position
of
the
room
she
darted
to
the
window
and
saw
her
carriage
but
a
few
yards
away
she
would
have
thrown
up
the
sash
but
found
she
could
not
she
twisted
her
handkerchief
round
her
gloved
hand
and
dashed
it
through
a
pane
men
she
cried
in
a
loud
commanding
voice
come
at
the
moment
she
went
to
the
window
i
sprang
to
the
door
locked
it
put
the
key
in
my
pocket
and
set
my
back
to
the
door
i
heard
the
men
thundering
at
the
lady
cairnedge
turned
as
if
she
would
herself
go
and
open
to
them
but
seeing
me
she
understood
what
i
had
done
and
went
back
to
the
window
come
here
come
to
me
here
to
the
window
she
cried
john
had
been
watching
with
a
calm
determined
look
he
came
and
stood
between
us
john
i
said
leave
your
mother
to
she
will
kill
you
he
answered
you
might
kill
her
i
replied
i
darted
to
the
chimney
where
a
clear
fire
was
burning
caught
up
the
poker
and
thrust
it
between
the
bars
that
for
you
i
whispered
they
will
not
touch
you
with
that
in
your
hand
never
mind
me
if
your
mother
move
hand
or
foot
to
help
them
it
will
be
my
turn
he
gave
me
a
smile
and
a
nod
and
his
eyes
lightened
i
saw
that
he
trusted
me
and
i
felt
fearless
as
a
in
the
meantime
she
had
spoken
to
her
servants
and
was
now
trying
to
open
the
window
which
had
a
peculiar
catch
i
saw
that
john
could
defend
himself
much
better
at
the
window
than
in
the
room
i
went
softly
behind
his
mother
put
my
hands
round
her
neck
and
clasping
them
in
front
pulled
her
backward
with
all
my
strength
we
fell
on
the
floor
together
i
under
of
course
but
clutching
as
if
all
my
soul
were
in
my
fingers
neither
should
she
meddle
with
john
nor
should
he
lay
hand
on
her
i
did
not
mind
much
what
i
did
to
her
myself
to
the
window
john
i
cried
and
break
their
heads
he
snatched
the
poker
from
the
fire
and
the
next
moment
i
heard
a
crashing
of
glass
but
of
course
i
could
not
see
what
was
going
on
mine
was
no
grand
way
of
fighting
but
what
was
dignity
where
john
was
in
danger
for
the
moment
i
had
the
advantage
but
while
determined
to
hold
on
to
the
last
i
feared
she
would
get
the
better
of
me
for
she
was
much
bigger
and
stronger
and
crushed
and
kicked
and
dug
her
elbows
into
me
struggling
like
a
mad
woman
all
at
once
the
tug
of
her
hands
on
mine
ceased
she
gave
a
great
shriek
and
i
felt
a
shudder
go
through
her
then
she
lay
still
i
relaxed
my
hold
cautiously
for
i
feared
a
trick
she
did
not
move
horror
seized
me
i
thought
i
had
killed
her
i
writhed
from
under
her
to
see
as
i
did
so
i
caught
sight
of
the
pale
face
of
my
uncle
looking
in
at
that
part
of
the
window
next
the
immediately
i
remembered
lady
cairnedge
terror
in
the
kitchen
and
knew
that
the
cause
of
it
and
of
her
present
cry
must
be
the
same
to
wit
the
sight
of
my
uncle
i
had
not
hurt
her
i
was
not
yet
on
my
feet
when
my
uncle
left
the
window
flew
to
the
other
side
of
it
and
fell
upon
the
men
with
a
stick
so
furiously
that
he
drove
them
to
the
carriage
the
horses
took
fright
and
went
prancing
about
rearing
and
jibbing
at
the
call
of
the
coachman
two
of
the
men
flew
to
their
heads
i
saw
no
more
of
their
assailant
john
who
had
not
got
a
fair
blow
at
one
of
his
besiegers
left
the
window
and
came
to
me
where
i
was
trying
to
restore
his
mother
the
third
man
the
butler
came
back
to
the
window
put
his
hand
through
undid
the
catch
and
flung
the
sash
wide
john
caught
up
the
poker
from
the
floor
and
darted
to
it
set
foot
within
the
window
parker
he
cried
and
i
will
break
your
the
man
did
not
believe
he
would
hurt
him
and
put
foot
and
head
through
the
window
now
john
had
honestly
threatened
but
to
perform
he
found
harder
than
he
had
thought
it
is
one
thing
to
raise
a
poker
and
another
to
strike
a
head
with
it
the
window
was
narrow
and
the
whole
man
was
not
yet
in
the
room
when
john
raised
his
weapon
but
he
could
not
bring
the
horrid
poker
down
upon
the
dumb
blind
back
of
the
stooping
man
head
he
threw
it
from
him
and
casting
his
eyes
about
spied
a
huge
on
a
he
sprang
to
it
and
caught
it
up
just
in
time
the
man
had
got
one
foot
firm
on
the
floor
and
was
slowly
drawing
in
the
other
when
down
came
the
bible
on
his
head
with
all
the
force
john
could
add
to
its
weight
the
butler
tumbled
senseless
on
the
floor
here
orbie
cried
john
help
me
to
bundle
him
out
before
he
comes
to
himself
take
what
you
would
have
he
said
as
between
us
we
shoved
him
out
on
the
gravel
i
fetched
and
brandy
and
everything
i
could
think
of
fetched
martha
too
and
between
us
we
got
her
on
the
sofa
but
lady
cairnedge
lay
motionless
she
breathed
indeed
but
did
not
open
her
eyes
john
stood
ready
to
do
anything
for
her
but
his
countenance
revealed
little
compassion
whatever
the
cause
of
his
mother
swoon
he
had
never
seen
her
in
one
before
he
was
certain
it
had
to
do
with
some
bad
passage
in
her
life
he
said
so
to
me
that
same
evening
but
what
could
the
sight
of
my
uncle
have
to
do
with
it
i
asked
probably
he
knows
something
or
she
thinks
he
does
he
answered
would
it
be
better
to
put
her
to
bed
and
send
for
the
doctor
john
i
suggested
at
last
perhaps
the
sound
of
my
voice
calling
her
son
by
his
christian
name
stung
her
proud
ear
for
the
same
moment
she
sat
up
passed
her
hands
over
her
eyes
and
cast
a
scared
gaze
about
the
room
where
am
i
is
it
gone
she
murmured
looking
ghastly
no
one
answered
her
call
parker
she
said
feebly
yet
imperiously
still
no
one
spoke
she
kept
glancing
sideways
at
the
window
where
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
the
gathering
night
in
a
few
moments
she
rose
and
walked
straight
from
the
room
erect
but
white
as
a
corpse
i
followed
passed
her
and
opened
the
there
stood
the
carriage
waiting
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
happened
parker
seated
in
the
rumble
with
one
of
the
footmen
beside
him
the
other
man
stood
by
the
he
opened
it
immediately
her
ladyship
stepped
in
and
dropped
on
the
seat
the
carriage
rolled
away
i
went
back
to
john
i
must
leave
you
darling
he
said
i
can
not
subject
you
to
the
risk
of
such
another
outrage
i
fear
sometimes
my
mother
may
be
what
she
would
have
you
think
me
i
ought
to
have
said
i
hope
she
is
it
would
be
the
only
possible
excuse
for
her
behaviour
the
natural
end
of
loving
own
way
is
to
go
mad
if
you
do
get
it
you
go
mad
if
you
do
get
it
you
go
madder
that
all
the
difference
i
must
go
i
tried
to
expostulate
with
him
but
it
was
of
no
use
where
will
you
go
i
said
you
can
not
go
home
i
would
at
once
he
answered
if
i
could
take
the
reins
in
my
own
hands
but
i
will
go
to
london
and
see
the
he
will
tell
me
what
i
had
better
you
have
no
money
i
said
how
do
you
know
that
he
returned
with
a
smile
have
you
been
searching
my
pockets
john
i
cried
he
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
your
uncle
will
lend
me
a
he
said
he
will
lend
you
as
much
as
you
want
but
i
do
think
he
in
the
house
i
answered
i
have
two
myself
though
i
run
and
fetch
i
bounded
away
to
get
the
notes
it
was
like
having
a
common
purse
already
to
lend
john
ten
pounds
but
i
had
no
intention
of
letting
him
leave
the
house
the
same
day
he
was
first
out
of
his
room
after
such
an
illness
that
was
if
i
could
help
it
my
uncle
had
given
me
the
use
of
a
drawer
in
that
same
cabinet
in
which
were
the
precious
stones
and
there
partly
i
think
from
the
pride
of
sharing
the
cabinet
with
my
uncle
i
had
long
kept
everything
i
counted
precious
i
should
have
kept
zoe
there
if
she
had
not
been
alive
and
too
big
chapter
xxv
a
very
strange
thing
the
moment
i
opened
the
door
of
the
study
i
saw
my
uncle
in
his
his
head
against
the
back
of
it
his
face
turned
to
the
ceiling
i
ran
to
his
side
and
dropped
on
my
knees
thinking
he
was
dead
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
me
but
with
such
a
wan
countenance
that
i
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
what
is
it
uncle
dear
i
gasped
and
sobbed
nothing
very
new
little
one
he
answered
it
is
something
terrible
uncle
i
cried
or
you
would
not
look
like
that
did
those
horrid
men
hurt
you
you
did
give
it
them
well
you
came
down
on
them
like
the
angel
on
the
assyrians
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
little
one
he
returned
what
men
the
men
that
came
with
john
mother
to
carry
him
off
if
it
had
been
for
my
beautiful
uncle
they
would
have
done
it
too
how
i
wondered
what
had
become
of
you
i
was
almost
in
despair
i
thought
you
had
left
us
to
ourselves
and
you
only
waiting
like
god
for
the
right
moment
he
sat
up
and
stared
at
me
bewildered
i
had
forgotten
all
about
john
he
said
as
to
what
you
think
i
did
i
know
nothing
about
it
i
have
been
out
of
this
room
since
i
saw
that
spectre
in
the
john
mother
you
mean
uncle
ah
she
john
mother
is
she
yes
i
thought
as
much
and
it
was
more
than
my
poor
brain
could
stand
it
was
too
terrible
my
little
one
this
is
death
to
you
and
me
my
heart
sank
within
me
one
thought
only
went
through
my
head
that
come
what
might
i
would
no
more
give
up
john
than
if
i
were
already
married
to
him
in
the
church
but
why
what
is
it
uncle
i
said
hardly
able
to
get
the
words
out
i
will
tell
you
another
time
he
answered
and
rising
went
to
the
door
john
is
going
to
london
i
said
following
him
is
he
he
returned
listlessly
he
wants
to
see
his
lawyer
and
try
to
get
things
on
a
footing
of
some
sort
between
his
mother
and
that
is
very
proper
he
replied
with
his
hand
on
the
lock
but
you
do
think
it
would
be
safe
for
him
to
travel
do
you
uncle
so
soon
after
his
illness
i
asked
no
i
can
not
say
i
do
it
would
not
be
safe
he
is
welcome
to
stop
till
will
you
not
tell
him
so
uncle
he
is
bent
on
going
i
would
rather
not
see
him
there
is
no
occasion
it
will
be
a
great
relief
to
me
when
he
is
able
quite
able
i
mean
to
go
home
to
his
mother
or
where
it
may
suit
him
it
was
indeed
like
death
to
hear
my
uncle
talk
so
differently
about
john
what
had
he
done
to
be
treated
in
this
way
taken
up
and
made
a
friend
of
and
then
cast
off
without
reason
given
my
dear
uncle
was
not
at
all
like
himself
to
say
he
forgot
our
trouble
and
danger
and
never
came
near
us
in
our
sore
peril
when
we
owed
our
deliverance
to
him
and
now
to
speak
like
this
concerning
john
something
was
terribly
wrong
with
him
i
dared
hardly
think
what
it
could
be
i
stood
speechless
my
uncle
opened
the
door
and
went
down
the
steps
the
sound
of
his
feet
along
the
corridor
and
down
the
stair
to
the
kitchen
died
away
in
my
ears
my
life
seemed
to
go
ebbing
with
it
i
was
stranded
on
a
desert
shore
and
he
in
whom
i
had
trusted
was
leaving
me
there
i
came
to
myself
a
little
got
the
two
and
returned
to
john
when
i
reached
the
door
of
the
room
i
found
my
heart
in
my
throat
and
my
brains
upside
down
what
was
i
to
say
to
him
how
could
i
let
him
go
away
so
late
and
how
could
i
let
him
stay
where
his
departure
would
be
a
relief
even
i
would
have
him
gone
from
where
he
was
not
wanted
i
saw
however
that
my
uncle
must
not
have
john
death
at
his
door
that
i
must
persuade
him
to
stay
the
night
i
went
in
and
gave
him
the
notes
but
begged
him
for
my
love
to
go
to
bed
in
the
morning
i
said
i
would
drive
him
to
the
station
he
yielded
with
difficulty
but
with
how
little
suspicion
that
all
the
time
i
wished
him
gone
i
went
to
bed
only
to
lie
listening
for
my
uncle
return
it
was
long
past
midnight
ere
he
came
in
the
morning
i
sent
penny
to
order
the
phaeton
and
then
ran
to
my
uncle
room
in
the
hope
he
would
want
to
see
john
before
he
left
i
was
not
sure
he
had
realized
that
he
was
going
he
was
neither
in
his
nor
in
the
study
i
went
to
the
stable
dick
was
putting
the
horse
to
the
phaeton
he
told
me
he
had
heard
his
master
two
hours
before
saddle
thanatos
and
ride
away
this
made
me
yet
more
anxious
about
him
he
did
not
often
ride
out
early
seldom
indeed
after
coming
home
late
things
seemed
to
threaten
complication
john
looked
so
much
better
and
was
so
eager
after
the
projected
interview
with
his
lawyer
that
i
felt
comforted
concerning
him
i
did
not
tell
him
what
my
uncle
had
said
the
night
before
it
would
i
felt
be
wrong
to
mention
what
my
uncle
might
wish
forgotten
and
as
i
did
not
know
what
he
meant
it
could
serve
no
end
we
parted
at
the
station
very
much
as
if
we
had
been
married
half
a
century
and
i
returned
home
to
brood
over
the
strange
things
that
had
happened
but
before
long
i
found
myself
in
a
weltering
swamp
of
futile
speculation
and
turned
my
thoughts
perforce
into
other
channels
lest
i
should
lose
the
power
of
thinking
and
be
drowned
in
reverie
my
uncle
had
taught
me
that
reverie
is
phaeton
in
the
chariot
of
apollo
the
weary
hours
passed
and
my
uncle
did
not
come
i
had
never
before
been
really
uneasy
at
his
longest
absence
but
now
i
was
far
more
anxious
about
him
than
about
john
alas
through
me
fresh
trouble
had
befallen
my
uncle
as
well
as
john
when
the
night
came
i
went
to
bed
for
i
was
very
tired
i
must
keep
myself
strong
for
something
unfriendly
was
on
its
way
and
i
must
be
able
to
meet
it
i
knew
well
i
should
not
sleep
until
i
heard
the
sounds
of
his
arrival
those
came
about
one
and
in
a
moment
i
was
dreaming
in
my
dream
i
was
still
awake
and
still
watching
for
my
uncle
return
i
heard
the
sound
of
death
hoofs
not
on
the
stones
of
the
yard
but
on
the
gravel
before
the
house
and
coming
round
the
house
till
under
my
window
there
he
stopped
and
i
heard
my
uncle
call
to
me
to
come
down
he
wanted
me
in
my
dream
i
was
a
child
i
sprang
out
of
bed
ran
from
the
house
on
my
bare
feet
jumped
into
his
arms
and
was
in
a
moment
seated
in
front
of
him
death
gave
a
great
plunge
and
went
off
like
the
wind
cleared
the
gate
in
a
flying
stride
and
rushed
up
the
hill
to
the
heath
the
wind
was
blowing
behind
us
furiously
i
could
hear
it
roaring
but
did
not
feel
it
for
it
could
not
overtake
us
we
and
kept
ahead
of
it
if
for
a
moment
we
slackened
speed
it
fell
upon
us
raging
we
came
at
length
to
the
pool
near
the
heart
of
the
heath
and
i
wondered
that
at
the
speed
we
were
making
we
had
been
such
a
time
in
reaching
it
it
was
the
dismalest
spot
with
its
crumbling
peaty
banks
and
its
water
brown
as
tea
tradition
declared
it
had
no
bottom
went
down
into
nowhere
here
said
my
uncle
bringing
his
horse
to
a
sudden
halt
we
had
a
terrible
battle
once
death
and
i
with
the
worm
that
lives
in
this
hole
you
know
what
worm
it
is
do
you
not
i
had
heard
of
the
worm
and
any
time
i
happened
in
galloping
about
the
heath
to
find
myself
near
the
pool
the
thought
would
always
come
back
with
a
fresh
shudder
what
if
the
legend
were
a
true
one
and
the
worm
was
down
there
biding
his
time
but
anything
more
about
the
worm
i
had
never
heard
no
uncle
i
answered
i
do
know
what
worm
it
ah
he
answered
with
a
sigh
if
you
do
not
take
the
more
care
little
one
you
will
some
day
learn
not
what
the
worm
is
called
but
what
it
is
the
worm
that
lives
there
is
the
worm
that
never
i
gave
a
shriek
i
had
never
heard
of
the
horrible
creature
before
so
it
seemed
in
my
dream
to
think
of
its
being
so
near
us
and
never
dying
was
too
terrible
do
be
frightened
little
one
he
said
pressing
me
closer
to
his
bosom
death
and
i
killed
it
come
with
me
to
the
other
side
and
you
will
see
it
lying
there
stiff
and
but
uncle
i
said
how
can
it
be
dead
how
can
you
have
killed
it
if
it
never
dies
ah
that
is
the
mystery
he
returned
but
come
and
see
it
was
a
terrible
fight
i
never
had
such
a
fight
or
dear
old
death
either
but
she
dead
now
it
was
worth
living
for
to
make
away
with
such
a
monster
we
rode
round
the
pool
cautiously
because
of
the
crumbling
banks
to
see
the
worm
lie
dead
on
and
on
we
rode
i
began
to
think
we
must
have
ridden
many
times
round
the
hole
i
wonder
where
it
can
be
uncle
i
said
at
length
we
shall
come
to
it
very
soon
he
answered
but
i
said
may
we
have
ridden
past
it
without
seeing
it
he
laughed
a
loud
and
terrible
laugh
when
once
you
have
seen
it
little
one
he
replied
you
too
will
laugh
at
the
notion
of
having
ridden
past
it
without
seeing
it
the
worm
that
never
dies
is
hardly
a
thing
to
escape
notice
we
rode
on
and
on
all
at
once
my
uncle
threw
up
his
hands
dropping
the
reins
and
with
a
fearful
cry
covered
his
face
it
is
gone
i
have
not
killed
it
no
i
have
not
it
is
here
it
is
here
he
cried
pressing
his
hand
to
his
heart
it
is
here
and
it
was
here
all
the
time
i
thought
it
dead
what
will
become
of
me
i
am
lost
lost
at
the
word
old
death
gave
a
scream
and
laying
himself
out
flew
with
all
the
might
of
his
swift
limbs
to
get
away
from
the
place
but
the
wind
which
was
behind
us
as
we
came
now
stormed
in
our
faces
and
presently
i
saw
we
should
never
reach
home
for
with
all
death
fierce
endeavour
we
moved
but
an
inch
or
two
in
the
minute
and
that
with
a
killing
struggle
little
one
said
my
uncle
if
you
do
get
down
we
shall
all
be
lost
i
feel
the
worm
rising
it
is
your
weight
that
keeps
poor
death
from
making
any
i
turned
my
head
leaning
past
my
uncle
so
as
to
see
behind
him
a
long
neck
surmounted
by
a
head
of
indescribable
horror
was
slowly
rising
straight
up
out
of
the
middle
of
the
pool
it
should
not
catch
them
i
slid
down
by
my
uncle
leg
the
moment
i
touched
the
ground
and
let
go
away
went
death
and
in
an
instant
was
out
of
sight
i
was
not
afraid
my
heart
was
lifted
up
with
the
thought
that
i
was
going
to
die
for
my
uncle
and
old
death
the
red
worm
was
on
the
bank
it
was
crawling
toward
me
i
went
to
meet
it
it
sprang
from
the
ground
threw
itself
upon
me
and
twisted
itself
about
me
it
was
a
human
embrace
the
embrace
of
some
one
unknown
that
loved
me
i
awoke
and
left
the
dream
but
the
dream
never
left
me
chapter
xxvi
the
evil
draws
nigher
i
rose
early
and
went
to
my
uncle
room
he
was
awake
but
complained
of
headache
i
took
him
a
cup
of
tea
and
at
his
request
left
him
about
noon
martha
brought
me
a
letter
where
i
sat
alone
in
the
i
carried
it
to
my
uncle
he
took
it
with
a
trembling
hand
read
it
and
fell
back
with
his
eyes
closed
i
ran
for
brandy
do
be
frightened
little
one
he
called
after
me
i
do
want
wo
you
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
uncle
i
said
returning
is
it
necessary
i
should
be
kept
ignorant
not
at
all
my
little
do
you
think
uncle
i
dared
to
continue
forgetting
in
my
love
all
difference
of
years
that
whatever
it
be
that
troubles
us
it
must
be
better
those
who
love
us
should
know
it
is
there
some
good
in
a
secret
after
all
none
my
darling
he
answered
the
thing
that
made
me
talk
to
you
so
against
secrets
when
you
were
a
child
was
that
i
had
one
myself
one
that
was
and
is
eating
the
heart
out
of
me
but
that
woman
shall
not
know
and
you
be
ignorant
i
will
not
have
a
secret
with
leave
me
now
please
little
i
rose
at
once
may
i
take
the
letter
with
me
uncle
i
asked
he
rubbed
his
forehead
with
a
still
trembling
hand
the
trembling
of
that
beloved
hand
filled
me
with
such
a
divine
sense
of
pity
that
for
the
first
time
i
seemed
to
know
god
causing
in
me
that
consciousness
the
whole
human
mother
was
roused
in
me
for
my
uncle
i
would
die
i
would
kill
to
save
him
the
worm
was
welcome
to
swallow
me
my
very
being
was
a
well
of
loving
pity
pouring
itself
out
over
that
trembling
hand
he
took
up
the
letter
gave
it
to
me
and
turned
his
face
away
with
a
groan
i
left
the
room
in
strange
exaltation
the
exaltation
of
merest
love
i
went
to
the
study
and
there
read
the
hateful
letter
here
it
is
having
transcribed
it
i
shall
destroy
it
sir
for
one
who
persists
in
coming
between
a
woman
and
her
son
who
will
blame
the
mother
if
she
cast
aside
forbearance
i
would
have
spared
you
as
hitherto
i
will
spare
you
no
longer
you
little
thought
when
you
crossed
me
who
i
was
the
one
in
the
world
in
whose
power
you
lay
i
would
perish
rather
than
permit
one
of
my
blood
to
marry
one
of
yours
my
words
are
strong
you
are
welcome
to
call
them
unladylike
but
you
shall
not
doubt
what
i
mean
you
know
perfectly
that
if
i
denounce
you
as
a
murderer
i
can
prove
what
i
say
and
as
to
my
silence
for
so
many
years
i
am
able
thoroughly
to
account
for
it
i
shall
give
you
no
further
warning
you
know
where
my
son
is
if
he
is
not
in
my
house
within
two
days
i
shall
have
you
arrested
have
made
up
my
lucretia
cairnedge
july
whoever
be
the
father
she
the
mother
of
lies
i
my
uncle
the
best
and
gentlest
of
men
a
murderer
i
laughed
aloud
in
my
indignation
and
wrath
but
though
the
woman
was
a
liar
she
must
have
something
to
say
with
a
show
of
truth
how
else
would
she
dare
intimidation
with
such
a
man
how
else
could
her
threat
have
so
wrought
upon
my
uncle
what
did
she
know
or
imagine
she
knew
what
could
be
the
something
on
which
she
founded
her
lie
that
my
uncle
was
going
to
tell
me
nor
did
i
dread
hearing
his
story
no
revelation
would
lower
him
in
my
eyes
of
that
i
was
confident
but
i
little
thought
how
long
it
would
be
before
it
came
or
what
a
terrible
tale
it
would
prove
i
ran
down
the
stair
with
the
vile
paper
in
my
hand
the
wicked
woman
i
cried
if
she
john
mother
i
do
care
she
a
devil
and
a
liar
hush
hush
little
one
said
my
uncle
with
a
smile
in
which
the
sadness
seemed
to
intensify
the
sweetness
you
do
not
anything
against
her
you
do
not
she
is
a
liar
there
are
things
uncle
one
knows
without
knowing
what
if
i
said
she
told
no
lie
i
should
say
she
was
a
liar
although
she
told
no
lie
my
uncle
is
not
what
she
threatens
to
say
he
is
but
men
have
repented
and
grown
so
different
you
would
not
know
them
how
can
you
tell
it
has
not
been
so
with
me
i
may
have
been
a
bad
man
once
and
grown
better
i
know
you
are
trying
to
prepare
me
for
what
you
think
will
be
a
shock
uncle
i
answered
but
i
want
no
preparing
out
with
your
worst
i
defy
you
ah
me
confident
but
i
had
not
to
repent
of
my
confidence
my
uncle
gave
a
great
sigh
he
looked
as
if
there
was
nothing
for
him
now
but
tell
all
evidently
he
shrank
from
the
task
he
put
his
hand
over
his
eyes
and
said
slowly
you
belong
to
a
world
little
one
of
which
you
know
next
to
nothing
more
than
satan
have
fallen
as
lightning
from
heaven
he
lay
silent
so
long
that
i
was
constrained
to
speak
again
well
uncle
dear
i
said
are
you
not
going
to
tell
me
i
can
not
he
answered
there
was
absolute
silence
for
i
should
think
about
twenty
minutes
i
could
not
and
would
not
urge
him
to
speak
what
right
had
i
to
rouse
a
killing
effort
he
was
not
bound
to
tell
anything
but
i
mourned
the
impossibility
of
doing
my
best
for
him
poor
as
that
best
might
be
do
not
think
my
darling
he
said
at
last
and
laid
his
hand
on
my
head
as
i
knelt
beside
him
that
i
have
the
least
difficulty
in
trusting
you
it
is
only
in
telling
you
i
would
trust
you
with
my
eternal
soul
you
can
see
well
enough
there
is
something
terrible
to
tell
for
would
i
not
otherwise
laugh
to
scorn
the
threat
of
that
bad
woman
no
one
on
the
earth
has
so
little
right
to
say
what
she
knows
of
me
yet
i
do
share
a
secret
with
her
which
feels
as
if
it
would
burst
my
heart
i
wish
it
would
that
would
open
the
one
way
out
of
all
my
trouble
believe
me
little
one
if
any
ever
needed
god
i
need
him
i
need
the
pardon
that
goes
hand
in
hand
with
righteous
judgment
the
pardon
of
him
who
alone
can
make
lawful
may
god
be
your
judge
uncle
and
neither
man
nor
woman
i
do
not
think
would
altogether
condemn
me
little
one
much
as
i
loathe
myself
terribly
as
i
deserve
condemn
you
uncle
i
want
to
know
all
just
to
show
you
that
nothing
can
make
the
least
difference
if
you
were
as
bad
as
that
bad
woman
says
you
should
find
there
was
one
of
your
own
blood
who
knew
what
love
meant
but
i
know
you
are
good
uncle
whatever
you
may
have
little
one
you
comfort
me
sighed
my
uncle
i
can
not
tell
you
this
thing
for
when
i
had
told
it
i
should
want
to
kill
myself
more
than
ever
but
neither
can
i
bear
that
you
should
not
know
it
i
will
have
a
secret
with
that
woman
i
have
always
intended
to
tell
you
everything
i
have
the
whole
fearful
story
set
down
for
your
eyes
and
those
of
any
you
may
wish
to
see
it
i
can
not
speak
the
words
into
your
ears
the
paper
i
will
give
you
now
but
you
will
not
open
it
until
i
give
you
certainly
not
if
i
should
die
before
you
have
read
it
i
permit
and
desire
you
to
read
it
i
know
your
loyalty
so
well
that
i
believe
you
would
not
look
at
it
even
after
my
death
if
i
had
not
given
you
permission
there
are
those
who
treat
the
dead
as
if
they
had
no
more
rights
of
any
kind
away
to
hades
they
say
are
nothing
now
but
you
will
not
behave
so
to
your
uncle
little
one
when
the
time
comes
for
you
to
read
my
story
remember
that
i
in
preparation
for
the
knowledge
that
will
give
you
ask
you
to
pardon
me
for
all
the
pain
it
will
cause
you
and
your
husband
john
being
that
husband
i
have
tried
to
do
my
best
for
you
orbie
how
much
better
i
might
have
done
had
i
had
a
clear
conscience
god
only
knows
it
may
be
that
i
was
the
tenderer
uncle
that
i
could
not
be
a
better
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
burst
into
a
tempest
of
weeping
it
was
terrible
to
see
the
man
to
whom
i
had
all
my
life
looked
with
a
reverence
that
prepared
me
for
knowing
the
great
father
weeping
like
a
bitterly
repentant
and
child
it
seemed
sacrilege
to
be
present
i
felt
as
if
my
eyes
only
for
seeing
him
thus
deserved
the
ravens
to
pick
them
out
i
could
not
contain
myself
i
rose
and
threw
my
arms
about
him
got
close
to
him
as
a
child
to
her
mother
and
as
soon
as
the
passion
of
my
love
would
let
me
sobbed
out
uncle
darling
uncle
i
love
you
more
than
ever
i
did
not
know
before
that
i
could
love
so
much
i
could
that
woman
with
my
own
hands
i
wish
i
had
killed
her
when
i
pulled
her
down
that
day
it
is
right
to
kill
poisonous
creatures
she
is
worse
than
any
snake
he
smiled
a
sad
little
smile
and
shook
his
head
then
first
i
seemed
to
understand
a
little
a
dull
flash
went
through
me
i
stood
up
drew
back
and
gazed
at
him
my
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
his
i
stared
into
them
he
had
ceased
to
weep
and
lay
regarding
me
with
calm
response
you
do
mean
uncle
yes
little
one
i
do
that
woman
was
the
cause
of
the
action
for
which
she
threatens
to
denounce
me
as
a
murderer
i
do
not
say
she
intended
to
bring
it
about
but
none
the
less
was
she
the
consciously
wicked
and
wilful
cause
of
and
you
will
marry
her
son
and
be
her
daughter
he
added
with
a
groan
as
of
one
in
unutterable
despair
i
sprang
back
from
him
my
very
proximity
was
a
pollution
to
him
while
he
believed
such
a
thing
of
me
never
uncle
never
i
cried
how
can
you
think
so
ill
of
one
who
loves
you
as
i
do
i
will
denounce
she
will
be
hanged
and
we
shall
be
at
peace
and
john
said
my
uncle
john
must
look
after
himself
i
answered
fiercely
because
he
chooses
to
have
such
a
mother
am
i
to
bring
her
a
nearer
to
my
uncle
not
for
any
man
that
ever
was
born
john
must
discard
his
mother
or
he
and
i
are
as
we
were
a
mother
she
is
a
hyena
a
shark
a
monster
uncle
she
is
a
i
do
care
it
is
true
and
what
is
true
is
the
right
thing
to
say
i
will
go
to
her
and
tell
her
to
her
face
what
she
is
i
turned
and
made
for
the
door
my
heart
felt
as
big
as
the
biggest
man
if
she
kill
you
little
one
said
my
uncle
quietly
i
shall
be
left
with
nobody
to
take
care
of
me
i
burst
into
fresh
tears
i
saw
that
i
was
a
fool
and
could
do
nothing
poor
john
to
have
such
a
mother
i
sobbed
then
in
a
rage
of
rebellion
i
cried
i
do
believe
she
his
mother
is
it
possible
now
uncle
does
it
stand
to
reason
that
such
a
pestilence
of
a
woman
should
ever
have
borne
such
a
child
as
my
john
i
do
i
ca
i
believe
it
i
am
afraid
there
are
mysteries
in
the
world
quite
as
hard
to
explain
replied
my
uncle
i
confess
if
i
had
known
who
was
his
mother
i
should
have
been
far
from
ready
to
yield
my
consent
to
your
what
does
it
matter
i
said
of
course
i
shall
not
marry
him
not
marry
him
child
returned
my
uncle
what
are
you
thinking
of
is
the
poor
fellow
to
suffer
for
as
well
as
by
the
sins
of
his
mother
if
you
think
uncle
that
i
will
bring
you
into
any
kind
of
relation
with
that
horrible
woman
if
the
worst
of
it
were
only
that
you
would
have
to
see
her
once
because
she
was
my
husband
mother
you
are
mistaken
she
to
threaten
you
if
you
did
not
send
back
her
son
as
if
john
were
a
horse
you
had
stolen
you
have
been
the
angel
of
god
about
me
all
the
days
of
my
life
but
even
to
please
you
i
can
not
consent
to
despise
myself
besides
you
know
what
she
threatens
she
shall
not
hurt
me
i
will
take
care
of
myself
for
your
sakes
your
life
shall
not
be
clouded
by
scandal
about
your
how
are
you
to
prevent
it
uncle
dear
fulfil
her
threat
or
not
she
would
be
sure
to
talk
when
she
sees
it
can
serve
no
purpose
she
will
hardly
risk
she
will
certainly
not
risk
them
when
she
finds
we
have
said
but
how
would
that
serve
me
little
one
what
would
you
heap
on
your
uncle
conscience
already
overburdened
the
misery
of
keeping
two
lovely
lovers
apart
i
will
tell
you
what
i
have
resolved
upon
i
will
have
no
more
secrets
from
you
orba
oh
how
i
thank
you
dearest
for
not
casting
me
off
again
i
threw
myself
on
my
knees
by
his
bed
uncle
i
cried
my
heart
ready
to
break
with
the
effort
to
show
itself
if
i
did
not
now
love
you
more
than
ever
i
should
deserve
to
be
cast
out
and
trodden
under
foot
what
do
you
think
of
doing
i
shall
leave
the
country
not
to
return
while
the
woman
i
ready
uncle
i
said
springing
to
my
feet
at
least
i
shall
be
in
a
few
minutes
but
hear
me
out
little
one
he
rejoined
with
a
smile
of
genuine
pleasure
you
do
know
half
my
plan
yet
how
am
i
to
live
abroad
if
my
property
go
to
rack
and
ruin
listen
and
do
say
anything
till
i
have
done
i
have
no
time
to
lose
i
must
get
up
at
as
soon
as
i
am
on
board
at
dover
for
paris
you
and
john
must
get
yourselves
married
the
first
possible
moment
and
settle
down
here
to
make
the
best
of
the
farm
you
can
and
send
me
what
you
can
spare
i
shall
not
want
much
and
john
will
have
his
own
soon
i
know
you
will
be
good
to
martha
john
may
take
the
farm
if
he
will
it
would
be
immeasurably
better
than
living
with
his
mother
for
me
i
am
going
with
my
uncle
why
uncle
i
should
be
miserable
in
john
very
arms
and
you
out
of
the
country
for
our
sakes
is
there
to
be
nobody
in
the
world
but
husbands
forsooth
i
should
love
john
ever
so
much
more
away
with
you
and
my
duty
than
if
i
had
him
with
me
and
you
a
wanderer
how
happy
i
shall
be
thinking
of
john
and
taking
care
of
you
he
let
me
run
on
when
i
stopped
at
length
in
any
case
he
said
with
a
smile
we
can
not
do
much
till
i
am
dressed
chapter
xxvii
an
encounter
i
left
my
uncle
room
and
went
to
my
own
to
make
what
preparation
i
could
for
going
abroad
with
him
i
got
out
my
biggest
box
and
put
in
all
my
best
things
and
all
the
trifles
i
thought
i
could
not
do
without
then
as
there
was
room
i
put
in
things
i
could
do
without
which
yet
would
be
useful
still
there
was
room
the
content
would
shake
about
on
the
continent
so
i
began
to
put
in
things
i
should
like
to
have
but
which
were
neither
necessary
nor
useful
before
i
had
got
these
in
the
box
was
more
than
full
and
some
of
them
had
to
be
taken
out
again
in
choosing
which
were
to
go
and
which
to
be
left
i
lost
time
but
i
did
not
know
anything
about
the
trains
and
expected
to
be
ready
before
my
uncle
who
would
call
me
when
he
thought
fit
my
thoughts
also
hindered
my
hands
very
likely
i
should
never
marry
john
i
would
not
heed
that
he
would
be
mine
all
the
same
but
to
promise
that
i
would
not
marry
him
because
it
suited
such
a
plans
to
marry
him
to
some
one
else
that
i
would
not
do
to
save
my
life
i
would
have
done
it
to
save
my
uncle
but
our
exile
would
render
it
unnecessary
at
last
i
was
ready
and
went
to
find
my
uncle
reproaching
myself
that
i
had
been
so
long
away
from
him
besides
i
ought
to
have
been
helping
him
to
pack
for
neither
he
nor
his
arm
was
quite
strong
yet
with
a
heartful
of
apology
i
sought
his
room
he
was
not
there
neither
was
he
in
the
study
i
went
all
over
the
house
and
then
to
the
stable
but
he
was
nowhere
neither
had
anyone
seen
him
and
death
was
gone
too
the
truth
burst
upon
me
i
was
to
see
him
no
more
while
that
terrible
woman
lived
no
one
was
to
know
whither
he
had
gone
he
had
given
himself
for
my
happiness
vain
intention
i
should
never
be
happy
to
be
in
paradise
without
him
would
not
be
to
be
in
heaven
john
was
in
london
i
could
do
nothing
i
threw
myself
on
my
uncle
bed
and
lay
lost
in
despair
even
if
john
were
with
me
and
we
found
him
what
could
we
do
i
knew
it
now
as
impossible
for
him
to
separate
us
that
he
might
be
unmolested
as
it
was
for
us
to
accept
the
sacrifice
of
his
life
that
we
might
be
happy
i
knew
that
john
way
would
be
to
leave
everything
and
go
with
me
and
my
uncle
only
we
could
not
live
upon
nothing
least
of
all
in
a
strange
land
martha
to
be
sure
could
manage
well
enough
with
the
bailiff
but
john
could
not
burden
my
uncle
and
could
not
lay
his
hands
on
his
own
in
the
mean
time
my
uncle
was
gone
we
knew
not
whither
i
was
like
one
lost
on
the
dark
if
only
john
would
come
to
take
part
in
my
despair
with
a
sudden
agony
i
reproached
myself
that
i
had
made
no
attempt
to
overtake
my
uncle
it
was
true
i
did
not
know
for
nobody
could
tell
me
in
what
direction
he
had
gone
but
zoe
instinct
might
have
sufficed
where
mine
was
useless
zoe
might
have
followed
and
found
thanatos
it
was
hopeless
now
but
i
could
no
longer
be
still
i
got
zoe
and
fled
to
the
moor
all
the
rest
of
the
day
i
rode
hither
and
thither
nor
saw
a
single
soul
on
its
wide
expanse
the
very
life
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
it
when
most
we
take
comfort
in
loneliness
it
is
because
there
is
some
one
behind
it
the
sun
was
set
and
the
twilight
deepening
toward
night
when
i
turned
to
ride
home
i
had
eaten
nothing
since
breakfast
and
though
not
hungry
was
thoroughly
tired
through
the
great
dark
hush
where
was
no
sound
of
water
though
here
and
there
like
lurking
live
thing
it
lay
about
me
i
rode
slowly
back
my
fasting
and
the
dusk
made
everything
in
turn
take
a
shape
that
was
not
its
own
i
seemed
to
be
haunted
by
things
unknown
i
have
sometimes
thought
whether
the
spirits
that
love
solitary
places
may
not
delight
in
appropriating
for
embodiment
momentary
and
partial
such
a
present
shape
as
may
happen
to
fit
one
of
their
passing
moods
whether
it
is
always
the
gnarled
hawthorn
or
misshapen
rock
that
between
the
wanderer
and
the
pale
sky
suddenly
appals
him
with
the
sense
of
the
hawthorn
the
rock
the
dead
pine
is
indeed
there
but
is
it
alone
there
some
such
thought
was
i
remember
in
my
mind
when
about
halfway
from
home
i
grew
aware
of
something
a
little
way
in
front
that
rose
between
me
and
a
dark
part
of
the
sky
it
seemed
a
figure
on
a
huge
horse
my
first
thought
very
naturally
was
of
my
uncle
the
next
of
the
great
gray
horse
and
his
rider
that
john
and
i
had
both
seen
on
the
moor
i
confess
to
a
little
awe
at
the
thought
of
the
latter
but
i
am
somehow
made
so
as
to
be
capable
of
awe
without
terror
and
of
the
latter
i
felt
nothing
the
composite
figure
drew
nearer
it
was
a
woman
on
horseback
immediately
i
recalled
the
adventure
of
my
childhood
and
then
remembered
that
john
had
said
his
mother
always
rode
the
biggest
horse
she
could
find
could
that
shape
towering
in
the
before
me
be
indeed
my
deadly
enemy
she
who
my
uncle
had
warned
me
would
kill
me
if
she
had
the
chance
a
fear
far
other
than
ghostly
invaded
me
and
for
a
moment
i
hesitated
whether
to
ride
on
or
turn
and
make
for
some
covert
until
she
should
have
passed
from
between
me
and
my
home
i
hope
it
was
something
better
than
pride
that
made
me
hold
on
my
way
if
the
wicked
i
thought
flee
when
no
man
pursueth
it
ill
becomes
the
righteous
to
flee
before
the
wicked
by
this
time
it
was
all
but
dark
night
and
i
had
a
vague
hope
of
passing
unquestioned
there
had
been
a
good
deal
of
rain
and
we
were
in
a
very
marshy
part
of
the
heath
so
that
i
did
not
care
to
leave
the
track
but
just
ere
we
met
the
lady
turned
her
great
animal
right
across
the
way
and
there
made
him
stand
ah
thought
i
what
could
zoe
do
in
a
race
with
that
terrible
horse
he
seemed
made
of
the
darkness
and
rose
like
the
figurehead
of
a
frigate
above
a
yacht
show
me
the
way
to
rising
said
his
rider
the
hard
was
unmistakable
when
you
come
where
the
track
forks
i
began
she
interrupted
me
how
can
i
distinguish
in
the
dark
she
returned
angrily
go
on
before
and
show
me
the
now
i
had
good
reason
for
thinking
she
knew
the
way
perfectly
well
and
still
better
reason
for
declining
to
go
on
in
front
of
her
you
must
excuse
me
i
said
for
it
is
time
i
were
at
home
but
if
you
will
turn
and
ride
on
in
front
of
me
i
will
show
you
a
better
though
rather
longer
way
to
go
on
or
i
will
ride
you
down
she
cried
turning
her
horse
head
toward
me
and
making
her
whip
hiss
through
the
air
the
sound
of
it
so
startled
zoe
that
she
sprang
aside
and
was
off
the
road
a
few
yards
before
i
could
pull
her
up
then
i
saw
the
woman
urging
her
horse
to
follow
i
knew
the
danger
she
was
in
and
though
tempted
to
be
silent
called
to
her
with
a
loud
warning
mind
what
you
are
doing
lady
cairnedge
i
cried
the
ground
here
will
not
carry
the
weight
of
a
horse
like
but
as
i
spoke
he
gave
in
and
sprang
across
the
ditch
at
the
there
however
he
stood
you
think
to
escape
me
she
answered
in
a
low
yet
clear
voice
with
a
growl
in
it
you
make
a
mistake
your
ladyship
will
make
a
worse
mistake
if
you
follow
me
here
i
replied
her
only
rejoinder
was
a
cut
with
her
whip
to
her
horse
which
had
stood
motionless
since
taking
his
unwilling
jump
i
spoke
to
zoe
she
bounded
off
like
a
fawn
i
pulled
her
up
and
looked
back
lady
cairnedge
continued
urging
her
horse
i
heard
and
saw
her
whipping
him
furiously
she
had
lost
her
temper
i
warned
her
once
more
but
she
persisted
then
you
must
take
the
consequences
i
said
and
zoe
and
i
made
for
the
road
but
at
a
point
nearer
home
had
she
not
been
in
a
passion
she
would
have
seen
that
her
better
way
was
to
return
to
the
road
and
intercept
us
but
her
anger
blinded
her
both
to
that
and
to
the
danger
of
the
spot
she
was
in
we
had
not
gone
far
when
we
heard
behind
us
the
soft
plunging
and
sucking
of
the
big
hoofs
through
the
boggy
ground
i
looked
over
my
shoulder
there
was
the
huge
bulk
like
wordsworth
peak
towering
betwixt
us
and
the
stars
go
zoe
i
shrieked
she
bounded
away
the
next
moment
a
cry
came
from
the
horse
behind
us
and
i
heard
the
woman
say
good
god
i
stopped
and
peered
through
the
dark
i
saw
something
but
it
was
no
higher
above
the
ground
than
myself
terror
seized
me
i
turned
and
rode
back
my
stupid
animal
has
bogged
himself
said
lady
cairnedge
quietly
deep
in
the
dark
watery
peat
as
thick
as
porridge
her
horse
gave
a
fruitless
plunge
or
two
and
sank
lower
for
god
sake
i
cried
get
off
your
weight
is
sinking
the
poor
animal
you
will
smother
him
it
will
serve
him
right
she
said
venomously
and
gave
the
helpless
creature
a
cut
across
the
ears
you
will
go
down
with
him
if
you
do
not
make
haste
i
insisted
another
moment
and
she
stood
erect
on
the
back
of
the
slowly
sinking
horse
come
and
give
me
your
hand
she
cried
you
want
to
smother
me
with
him
i
think
i
will
not
i
answered
you
can
get
on
the
solid
well
enough
i
will
ride
home
and
bring
help
for
your
horse
poor
fellow
stay
by
him
talk
to
him
and
keep
him
as
quiet
as
you
can
if
he
go
on
struggling
nothing
will
save
she
replied
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
i
got
to
the
road
as
quickly
as
possible
and
galloped
home
as
fast
as
zoe
could
touch
and
lift
ere
i
reached
the
i
shouted
so
as
to
bring
out
all
the
men
when
i
told
them
a
lady
had
her
horse
fast
in
the
bog
they
bustled
and
coiled
ropes
put
collars
and
chains
on
four
lighted
several
lanterns
and
set
out
with
me
i
knew
the
spot
perfectly
no
moment
was
lost
either
in
getting
ready
or
in
reaching
the
place
neither
the
lady
nor
her
horse
was
to
be
seen
a
great
horror
wrapt
me
round
i
felt
a
murderess
she
might
have
failed
to
spring
to
the
bank
of
the
hole
for
lack
of
the
hand
she
had
asked
me
to
reach
out
or
her
habit
might
have
been
entangled
so
that
she
fell
short
and
went
to
the
bottom
to
be
found
one
day
hardly
changed
by
the
side
of
her
steed
no
ill
fitting
fate
for
her
but
a
ghastly
thing
to
have
a
hand
in
she
might
however
be
on
her
way
to
rising
on
foot
i
told
two
of
the
men
to
mount
a
pair
of
the
horses
and
go
with
me
on
the
chance
of
rendering
her
assistance
we
took
the
way
to
rising
and
had
gone
about
two
miles
when
we
saw
her
through
the
starlight
walking
steadily
along
the
track
i
rode
up
to
her
and
offered
her
one
of
the
i
would
not
have
trusted
my
zoe
with
her
any
more
than
with
an
american
lion
that
lives
upon
horses
she
declined
the
proffer
with
quiet
scorn
i
offered
her
one
or
both
men
to
see
her
home
but
the
way
in
which
she
refused
their
service
made
them
glad
they
had
not
to
go
with
her
we
had
no
choice
therefore
turned
and
left
her
to
get
home
as
she
might
not
until
we
were
on
the
way
back
did
it
occur
to
me
that
i
had
not
asked
martha
whether
she
knew
anything
about
my
uncle
departure
she
was
never
one
to
volunteer
news
and
besides
would
naturally
think
me
in
his
confidence
i
found
she
knew
nothing
of
our
expedition
as
no
one
had
gone
into
the
house
had
only
heard
the
horses
and
voices
and
wondered
i
was
able
to
tell
her
what
had
happened
but
the
moment
i
began
to
question
her
as
to
any
knowledge
of
my
uncle
intentions
my
strength
gave
way
and
i
burst
into
tears
do
be
silly
belorba
cried
martha
almost
severely
you
an
engaged
young
lady
and
tied
so
to
your
uncle
that
you
cry
the
minute
he
out
of
your
sight
you
did
cry
when
day
left
you
no
i
answered
he
was
going
only
for
a
day
or
two
and
for
how
many
is
your
uncle
gone
that
is
what
i
want
to
know
he
means
to
be
away
a
long
time
i
then
it
nothing
but
your
fancy
sets
you
crying
but
i
just
see
she
returned
i
shall
know
by
the
money
he
left
for
the
only
i
wo
budge
till
i
see
you
faint
for
want
of
food
i
had
no
appetite
but
i
began
at
once
to
eat
and
she
left
me
to
fetch
the
money
he
had
given
her
as
he
went
she
came
back
with
a
opened
it
and
looked
into
it
then
she
looked
at
me
her
expression
was
of
unmistakable
dismay
i
took
the
from
her
hand
it
was
full
of
notes
i
learned
afterward
that
it
was
his
habit
to
have
money
in
the
house
in
readiness
for
some
possible
sudden
need
of
it
chapter
xxviii
another
vision
that
same
night
within
an
hour
to
my
unspeakable
relief
john
came
home
at
least
he
came
to
me
who
he
always
said
was
his
home
it
was
rather
late
but
we
went
out
to
the
wilderness
where
i
had
a
good
cry
on
his
shoulder
after
which
i
felt
better
and
hope
began
to
show
signs
of
life
in
me
i
never
asked
him
how
he
had
got
on
in
london
but
told
him
all
that
had
happened
since
he
went
it
was
worse
than
painful
to
tell
him
about
his
mother
letter
and
what
my
uncle
told
me
in
consequence
of
it
also
my
personal
adventure
with
her
so
lately
but
i
felt
i
must
hide
nothing
if
a
man
mother
is
a
devil
it
is
well
he
should
know
it
he
sat
like
a
sleeping
hurricane
while
i
spoke
saying
never
a
word
when
i
had
ended
is
that
all
he
asked
it
is
all
john
is
it
not
enough
i
answered
it
is
enough
he
cried
with
an
oath
that
frightened
me
and
started
to
his
feet
the
hurricane
was
awake
i
threw
my
arms
round
him
where
are
you
going
i
said
to
he
answered
what
for
to
her
he
said
then
threw
himself
on
the
ground
and
lay
motionless
at
my
feet
i
kept
silence
i
thought
with
myself
he
was
fighting
the
nature
his
mother
had
given
him
he
lay
still
for
about
two
minutes
then
quietly
rose
good
night
dearest
he
said
no
it
is
not
fit
the
son
of
such
a
mother
should
marry
any
honest
i
beg
your
pardon
john
i
returned
i
hope
may
have
a
word
in
the
matter
if
i
choose
to
marry
you
what
right
have
you
to
draw
back
let
us
leave
alone
the
thing
that
has
to
be
and
remember
that
my
uncle
must
not
be
denounced
as
a
murderer
something
must
be
done
that
he
is
beyond
personal
danger
for
the
present
is
something
but
is
he
to
be
the
talk
of
the
country
no
harm
shall
come
to
him
said
john
if
i
do
throttle
the
tigress
i
muzzle
her
i
know
how
to
deal
with
her
she
has
learned
at
least
that
what
her
stupid
son
says
he
does
i
shall
make
her
understand
that
on
her
slightest
movement
to
disgrace
your
uncle
i
will
marry
you
right
off
come
what
may
and
if
she
goes
on
i
shall
get
myself
summoned
for
the
defence
that
if
i
can
say
nothing
for
i
may
say
something
against
besides
i
will
tell
her
that
when
my
time
comes
if
i
find
anything
amiss
with
her
accounts
i
will
give
her
no
but
orbie
he
continued
as
i
will
not
threaten
what
i
may
not
be
able
to
perform
you
must
promise
not
to
prevent
me
from
carrying
it
i
promise
i
said
that
if
it
be
necessary
for
your
truth
i
will
marry
you
at
once
i
only
hope
she
may
not
already
have
taken
steps
her
two
days
are
not
yet
expired
i
shall
present
myself
in
good
but
i
wonder
you
are
not
afraid
to
trust
yourself
alone
with
the
son
of
such
a
mother
to
be
what
i
know
you
john
i
answered
and
the
son
of
that
woman
shows
a
good
angel
was
not
far
off
at
your
birth
but
why
talk
of
angels
whoever
was
your
mother
god
is
your
father
he
made
no
reply
beyond
a
loving
pressure
of
my
hand
then
he
asked
me
whether
i
could
lend
him
something
to
ride
home
upon
i
told
him
there
was
an
old
horse
the
bailiff
rode
sometimes
i
was
very
sorry
he
could
not
have
zoe
she
had
been
out
all
day
and
was
too
tired
he
said
zoe
was
much
too
precious
for
a
hulking
fellow
like
him
to
ride
but
he
would
be
glad
of
the
old
horse
i
went
to
the
stable
with
him
and
saw
him
mount
what
a
determined
look
there
was
on
his
face
he
seemed
quite
a
man
i
have
now
to
tell
how
he
fared
on
the
moor
as
he
rode
it
had
turned
gusty
and
rather
cold
and
was
still
a
dark
night
the
moon
would
be
up
by
and
by
however
and
giving
light
enough
he
thought
before
he
came
to
the
spot
where
his
way
parted
company
with
that
to
dumbleton
the
moon
however
did
not
see
fit
to
rise
so
soon
as
john
expected
her
he
was
not
at
that
time
quite
in
moons
any
more
than
in
the
paths
across
that
moor
now
as
he
had
not
an
idea
where
his
rider
wanted
to
be
carried
and
as
john
did
for
a
while
he
confessed
it
fall
into
a
reverie
or
something
worse
old
sturdy
had
to
choose
for
himself
where
to
go
and
took
a
path
he
had
often
had
to
take
some
years
before
nor
did
john
discover
that
he
was
out
of
the
way
until
he
felt
him
going
steep
clown
and
thought
of
sleipner
bearing
hermod
to
the
realm
of
hela
but
he
let
him
keep
on
wishing
to
know
as
he
said
what
the
old
fellow
was
up
to
presently
he
came
to
a
dead
halt
john
had
not
the
least
notion
where
they
were
but
i
knew
the
spot
the
moment
he
began
to
describe
it
by
the
removal
of
the
peat
on
the
side
of
a
slope
the
skeleton
of
the
hill
had
been
a
little
exposed
and
had
for
a
good
many
years
been
blasted
for
nothing
was
going
on
in
the
quarry
at
present
above
it
was
rather
a
dangerous
place
there
was
a
legend
of
man
and
horse
having
fallen
into
it
and
both
being
killed
john
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
it
when
his
horse
stopped
he
became
aware
of
an
indefinite
sensation
which
inclined
him
to
await
the
expected
moon
before
attempting
either
to
advance
or
return
he
thought
afterward
it
might
have
been
some
feeling
of
the
stone
about
him
but
at
the
time
he
took
the
place
for
an
abrupt
natural
dip
of
the
surface
of
the
moor
in
the
bottom
of
which
might
be
a
pool
sturdy
stood
as
still
as
if
he
had
been
part
of
the
quarry
stood
as
if
never
of
himself
would
he
move
again
the
light
slowly
grew
or
rather
the
darkness
slowly
thinned
all
at
once
john
became
aware
that
some
yards
away
from
him
there
was
something
whitish
a
moment
and
it
began
to
move
like
a
flitting
mist
through
the
darkness
the
same
instant
sturdy
began
to
pull
his
feet
from
the
ground
and
move
after
the
mist
which
rose
and
rose
until
it
came
for
a
second
or
two
between
john
and
the
sky
it
was
a
big
white
horse
with
my
uncle
on
his
back
death
and
he
john
concluded
were
out
on
one
of
their
dark
wanderings
his
impulse
of
course
was
to
follow
them
but
as
they
went
up
the
steep
way
sturdy
came
down
on
his
old
knees
and
john
got
off
his
back
to
let
him
recover
himself
the
easier
when
they
reached
the
level
where
the
moon
showing
a
blunt
horn
above
the
horizon
made
it
possible
to
see
a
little
the
white
horse
and
his
rider
had
disappeared
in
some
shadow
or
behind
some
knoll
i
fancy
and
john
having
not
the
least
notion
in
what
part
of
the
moor
he
was
or
in
which
direction
he
ought
to
go
threw
the
reins
on
the
horse
neck
sturdy
brought
him
back
almost
to
his
stable
before
he
knew
where
he
was
then
he
turned
into
the
road
for
he
had
had
enough
of
the
moor
and
took
the
long
way

mother
and
son
in
the
morning
he
breakfasted
alone
a
son
with
a
different
sort
of
mother
might
then
have
sought
her
in
her
bedroom
but
john
had
never
within
his
memory
seen
his
mother
in
her
bedroom
and
after
what
lie
had
heard
the
night
before
could
hardly
be
inclined
to
go
there
to
her
now
within
half
an
hour
however
a
message
was
brought
him
requesting
his
presence
in
her
ladyship
he
went
with
his
teeth
set
whose
horse
is
that
in
the
stable
john
she
said
the
moment
their
eyes
met
mr
whichcote
madam
answered
john
he
could
not
say
you
intend
to
keep
up
your
late
relations
with
those
persons
i
you
mean
to
marry
the
hussy
i
mean
to
marry
the
lady
to
whom
you
give
that
epithet
there
are
those
who
think
it
not
quite
safe
for
you
to
call
other
people
names
she
rose
and
came
at
him
as
if
she
would
strike
him
john
stood
motionless
except
a
woman
had
a
knife
in
her
hand
he
said
he
would
not
even
avoid
a
blow
from
her
a
woman
ca
hurt
you
much
she
can
only
break
your
heart
he
said
my
mother
would
not
know
a
heart
when
she
had
broken
it
he
added
he
stood
and
looked
at
her
she
turned
away
and
sat
down
again
i
think
she
felt
the
term
of
her
power
at
hand
the
man
told
you
then
that
if
you
did
not
return
immediately
i
would
get
him
into
trouble
he
has
told
me
nothing
i
have
not
seen
him
for
some
days
i
have
been
to
you
should
have
contrived
your
story
better
you
contradict
i
am
not
aware
that
i
you
have
the
man

his
horse
is
in
my
stable
he
is
not
himself
at
fled
from
justice
it
shall
not
avail
him
it
may
avail
you
though
madam
it
is
sometimes
prudent
to
let
well
alone
may
i
not
suggest
that
a
hostile
attempt
on
your
part
might
lead
to
awkward
revelations
ah
where
could
the
seed
of
slander
find
fitter
soil
than
the
heart
of
a
son
with
whom
the
prayer
of
his
mother
is
powerless
to
all
appearance
she
had
thoroughly
regained
her
composure
and
looked
at
him
with
a
quite
artistic
reproach
the
prayer
of
a
mother
that
never
prayed
in
her
life
returned
john
of
a
woman
that
never
had
an
anxiety
but
for
herself
i
do
believe
you
are
my
mother
if
i
was
born
of
you
there
must
have
been
some
juggling
with
my
soul
in
antenatal
regions
i
disown
you
cried
john
with
indignation
that
grew
as
he
gave
it
issue
her
face
turned
ashy
white
but
whether
it
was
from
conscience
or
fear
or
only
with
rage
who
could
tell
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
again
recovering
herself
and
what
pray
would
you
make
of
me
she
said
coolly
your
slave
i
would
have
you
an
honest
woman
i
would
die
for
that
oh
mother
mother
he
cried
bitterly
that
being
apparently
impossible
what
else
does
my
dutiful
son
demand
of
his
mother
that
she
should
leave
me
unmolested
in
my
choice
of
a
wife
it
does
not
seem
to
me
an
unreasonable
demand
nor
does
it
seem
to
me
an
unreasonable
reply
that
any
mother
would
object
to
her
son
marrying
a
girl
whose
father
she
could
throw
into
a
with
a
word
that
the
girl
does
not
happen
to
be
the
daughter
of
the
gentleman
you
mean
signifies
nothing
i
am
very
willing
she
should
pass
for
such
but
take
care
he
is
ready
to
meet
whatever
you
have
to
say
he
is
not
gone
for
his
own
sake
but
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
our
happiness
to
prevent
you
from
blasting
us
with
a
public
scandal
if
you
proceed
in
your
purpose
we
shall
marry
at
once
and
make
your
scheme
how
are
you
to
live
pray
madam
that
is
my
business
answered
john
are
you
aware
of
the
penalty
on
your
marrying
without
my
consent
pursued
his
mother
i
am
not
i
do
not
believe
there
is
any
such
you
dare
me
i
marry
then
and
take
the
if
there
were
any
you
would
not
thus
warn
me
of
john
day
you
are
no
gentleman
i
shall
not
ask
your
definition
of
a
gentleman
your
father
was
a
clown
if
my
father
were
present
he
would
show
himself
a
gentleman
by
making
you
no
answer
if
you
say
a
word
more
against
him
i
will
leave
the
i
tell
you
your
father
was
a
clown
and
a
fool
like
yourself
john
turned
and
went
to
the
stable
had
old
sturdy
saddled
and
came
to
me
on
his
way
over
the
heath
he
spent
an
hour
trying
to
find
the
place
where
he
had
been
the
night
before
but
without
success
i
presume
that
sturdy
with
his
nose
in
that
direction
preferred
his
stall
and
did
not
choose
to
find
the
quarry
as
often
as
john
left
him
to
himself
he
went
homeward
when
john
turned
his
head
in
another
direction
he
would
set
out
in
that
direction
but
gradually
work
round
for
the
farm
john
told
me
all
i
have
just
set
down
and
then
we
talked
i
have
already
begun
to
learn
farming
i
said
you
are
the
right
sort
orbie
returned
john
i
shall
be
glad
to
teach
you
anything
i
if
you
will
show
me
how
a
farmer
keeps
his
books
i
answered
that
i
may
understand
the
bailiff
i
shall
be
greatly
obliged
to
you
as
to
the
dairy
and
and
that
kind
of
thing
martha
can
teach
me
as
well
as
i
do
my
best
said
john
come
along
then
and
have
a
talk
with
simmons
i
feel
as
if
i
could
bear
anything
after
what
you
saw
last
night
my
uncle
is
not
far
off
he
is
somewhere
about
with
the
rest
of
the
angels
chapter
xxx
once
more
and
yet
again
from
that
hour
i
set
myself
to
look
after
my
uncle
affairs
it
was
the
only
way
to
endure
his
absence
working
for
him
thinking
what
he
would
like
trying
to
carry
it
out
referring
every
perplexity
to
him
and
imagining
his
answer
he
grew
so
much
dearer
to
me
that
his
absence
was
filled
with
hope
my
heart
being
in
it
i
had
soon
learned
enough
of
the
management
to
perceive
where
in
more
than
one
quarter
improvement
generally
in
the
way
of
saving
was
possible
i
do
not
mean
by
any
lowering
of
wages
my
uncle
would
have
conned
me
small
thanks
for
such
improvement
as
that
neither
was
it
long
before
i
began
to
delight
in
the
feeling
that
i
was
in
partnership
with
the
powers
of
life
that
i
had
to
do
with
the
operation
and
government
and
preservation
of
things
created
that
i
was
doing
a
work
to
which
i
was
set
by
the
highest
that
i
was
at
least
a
in
the
house
of
god
a
servant
for
the
good
of
his
world
existence
had
grown
fuller
and
richer
i
had
come
like
a
toad
out
of
a
rock
into
a
larger
therefore
truer
universe
in
which
i
had
work
to
do
that
was
wanted
had
i
not
been
thus
expanded
and
strengthened
how
should
i
have
patiently
waited
while
hearing
nothing
of
my
uncle
it
was
not
many
days
before
john
began
to
press
me
to
let
my
uncle
have
his
way
where
was
the
good
any
longer
he
said
in
our
not
being
married
but
i
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
being
married
without
my
uncle
it
would
not
seem
real
marriage
without
his
giving
me
to
my
husband
and
when
john
was
convinced
that
i
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
i
found
him
think
the
more
of
me
because
of
my
resolve
and
my
persistency
in
it
for
john
was
always
reasonable
and
that
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
most
men
some
indeed
who
are
reasonable
enough
with
men
are
often
unreasonable
with
women
if
in
course
of
time
the
management
of
affairs
be
taken
from
men
and
given
to
women
which
may
god
for
our
sakes
forbid
it
will
be
because
men
have
made
it
necessary
by
their
arrogance
but
when
they
have
been
kept
down
long
enough
to
learn
that
they
are
not
the
lords
of
creation
one
bit
more
than
the
weakest
woman
i
hope
they
will
be
allowed
to
take
the
lead
again
lest
women
should
become
what
men
were
and
go
strutting
in
their
importance
only
the
true
man
knows
the
true
woman
only
the
true
woman
knows
the
true
man
the
difficulty
between
men
and
women
comes
all
from
the
prevailing
selfishness
that
is
untruth
of
both
who
while
such
is
their
character
would
be
judge
or
divider
between
them
save
one
of
their
own
kind
when
such
ceases
to
be
their
character
they
will
call
for
no
umpire
john
lived
in
his
own
house
with
his
mother
but
they
did
not
meet
his
mother
managed
his
affairs
to
whose
advantage
i
need
hardly
say
and
john
helped
me
to
manage
my
uncle
to
the
advantage
of
all
concerned
every
morning
he
came
to
see
me
and
every
night
rode
back
to
his
worse
than
dreary
home
at
my
earnest
request
he
had
a
strong
bolt
put
on
his
the
use
of
which
he
promised
me
never
to
neglect
at
my
suggestion
too
he
let
it
be
known
that
he
had
always
a
brace
of
loaded
pistols
within
his
reach
and
showed
himself
well
practiced
in
shooting
with
them
i
feared
much
for
john
after
i
no
longer
only
believed
but
knew
the
bailiff
trustworthy
and
had
got
some
few
points
in
his
management
bettered
i
ceased
giving
so
much
attention
to
details
and
allowed
myself
more
time
to
read
and
walk
and
ride
with
john
i
laid
myself
out
to
make
up
to
him
as
much
as
ever
i
could
for
the
miserable
lack
of
any
at
rising
he
had
not
the
least
sense
of
comfort
or
even
security
he
could
never
tell
what
his
mother
might
not
be
plotting
against
him
he
had
a
very
strong
close
box
made
for
leander
and
always
locked
him
up
in
it
at
night
never
allowing
one
of
the
men
there
to
touch
him
the
horse
had
all
the
attention
any
master
could
desire
when
having
locked
his
box
behind
him
he
brought
him
over
to
us
in
the
morning
one
lovely
cold
day
in
the
month
of
march
with
ice
on
some
of
the
pools
and
the
wind
blowing
from
the
north
i
mounted
zoe
to
meet
john
midway
on
the
moor
and
had
gone
about
of
the
distance
when
i
saw
him
as
i
thought
a
long
way
to
my
right
and
concluded
he
had
not
expected
me
so
soon
and
had
gone
exploring
i
turned
aside
therefore
to
join
him
but
had
gone
only
a
few
yards
when
from
some
shift
in
a
shadow
or
some
change
in
his
position
with
regard
to
the
light
i
saw
that
the
horse
was
not
john
it
was
a
gray
or
rather
a
white
horse
could
the
rider
be
my
uncle
even
at
that
distance
i
almost
thought
i
recognized
him
it
must
indeed
have
been
he
john
saw
at
the
quarry
he
was
not
gone
abroad
he
had
been
all
this
long
time
lingering
about
the
place
lest
ill
should
befall
us
just
like
him
said
my
heart
as
i
gave
zoe
the
rein
and
she
sprang
off
at
her
best
speed
but
after
riding
some
distance
i
lost
sight
of
the
horseman
whoever
he
was
and
then
saw
that
if
i
did
not
turn
at
once
i
should
not
keep
my
appointment
with
john
of
course
had
i
it
was
my
uncle
i
should
have
followed
and
followed
and
the
incident
would
not
have
been
worth
mentioning
for
gray
horses
are
not
so
uncommon
that
there
might
not
be
one
upon
the
heath
at
any
moment
but
for
something
more
i
saw
the
same
night
it
was
bright
moonlight
i
had
taken
down
a
curtain
of
my
window
to
mend
and
the
moon
shone
in
so
that
i
could
not
sleep
my
thoughts
were
all
with
my
uncle
wondering
what
he
was
about
whether
he
was
very
dull
whether
he
wanted
me
much
whether
he
was
going
about
paris
or
haunting
the
moor
that
stretched
far
into
the
distance
from
where
i
lay
perhaps
at
that
moment
he
was
out
there
in
the
moonlight
would
be
there
alone
in
the
cold
wide
night
while
i
slept
the
thought
made
me
feel
lonely
myself
one
is
indeed
apt
to
feel
lonely
when
sleepless
and
as
the
moon
was
having
a
night
of
it
or
rather
making
a
day
of
it
all
alone
with
herself
why
should
we
not
keep
each
other
a
little
company
i
rose
drew
the
other
curtain
of
my
window
aside
and
looked
out
i
have
said
that
the
house
lay
on
the
slope
of
a
hollow
from
whichever
window
of
it
you
glanced
you
saw
the
line
of
your
private
horizon
either
close
to
you
or
but
a
little
way
off
if
you
wanted
an
outlook
you
must
climb
and
then
you
were
on
the
moor
from
my
window
i
could
see
the
more
distant
edge
of
the
hollow
looking
thitherward
i
saw
against
the
sky
the
shape
of
a
man
on
horseback
not
for
a
moment
could
i
doubt
it
was
my
uncle
the
figure
was
plainly
his
my
heart
seemed
to
stand
still
with
awe
or
was
it
with
intensity
of
gladness
perhaps
every
night
he
was
thus
near
me
while
i
slept
a
heavenly
sentinel
patrolling
the
house
the
visible
one
of
a
whole
camp
unseen
of
horses
of
fire
and
chariots
of
fire
so
entrancing
was
the
notion
that
i
stood
there
a
little
child
a
mere
incarnate
love
the
tears
running
down
my
checks
for
very
bliss
but
presently
my
mood
changed
what
had
befallen
him
when
first
i
saw
him
horse
and
man
were
standing
still
and
i
noted
nothing
strange
blinded
perhaps
by
the
tears
of
my
gladness
but
presently
they
moved
on
keeping
so
to
the
that
it
was
plain
my
uncle
object
was
to
have
the
house
full
in
view
and
as
thus
they
skirted
the
edge
of
heaven
oh
how
changed
he
seemed
his
tall
figure
hung
bent
over
the
pommel
his
neck
drooped
heavily
and
the
horse
was
so
thin
that
i
seemed
to
see
almost
to
feel
his
bones
poor
thanatos
he
looked
tired
to
death
and
i
fancied
his
bent
knees
quivering
each
short
slow
step
he
took
ah
how
unlike
the
happy
old
horse
that
had
been
i
thought
of
death
returning
home
weary
from
the
slaughter
of
many
kings
and
cast
the
thought
away
i
thought
of
death
returning
home
on
the
eve
of
the
great
dawn
worn
with
his
work
pleased
that
at
last
it
was
over
and
no
more
need
of
him
i
kept
that
thought
along
the
they
held
their
slow
way
toilsome
through
weakness
the
rider
with
weary
swing
in
the
saddle
the
horse
with
long
gray
neck
hanging
low
to
his
hoofs
as
if
picking
his
path
with
purblind
eyes
when
his
rider
should
collapse
and
fall
from
his
back
not
a
step
further
would
he
take
but
stand
there
till
he
fell
to
pieces
fancy
gave
way
to
reality
i
woke
up
called
myself
hard
names
and
hurried
on
a
few
of
my
clothes
my
blessed
uncle
out
in
the
night
and
weary
to
dissolution
and
i
at
a
window
contemplating
him
like
a
picture
i
was
an
evil
heartless
brute
by
the
time
i
had
my
shoes
on
and
went
again
to
the
window
he
had
passed
out
of
its
range
i
ran
to
one
on
the
stair
that
looked
at
right
angles
to
mine
he
had
not
yet
come
within
its
field
i
stood
and
waited
presently
he
appeared
crawling
along
a
gray
mounted
ghost
in
the
light
that
so
strangely
befits
lovers
wandering
in
the
may
of
hope
and
the
wasted
spectre
no
less
whose
imagination
of
the
past
reveals
him
to
the
eyes
of
men
for
an
instant
i
almost
wished
him
dead
and
at
rest
the
next
i
was
out
of
the
house
then
up
on
the
moor
looking
eagerly
this
way
and
that
poised
on
the
swift
feet
of
love
ready
to
spring
to
his
bosom
how
i
longed
to
lead
him
to
his
own
warm
bed
and
watch
by
him
as
he
slept
while
the
great
father
kept
watch
over
every
heart
in
his
universe
i
gazed
and
gazed
but
nowhere
could
i
see
the
horseman
i
bounded
down
the
hill
through
the
wilderness
and
the
dark
alleys
and
hurried
to
the
stable
trembling
with
haste
i
led
zoe
out
sprang
on
her
bare
back
and
darted
off
to
scout
the
moor
not
a
man
or
a
horse
or
a
live
thing
was
to
be
seen
in
any
direction
once
more
i
all
but
concluded
i
had
looked
on
an
apparition
was
my
uncle
dead
had
he
come
back
thus
to
let
me
know
and
was
he
now
gone
home
indeed
cold
and
disappointed
i
returned
to
bed
full
of
the
conviction
that
i
had
seen
my
uncle
but
whether
in
the
body
or
out
of
the
body
i
could
not
tell
when
john
came
the
notion
of
my
having
been
out
alone
on
the
moor
in
the
middle
of
the
night
did
not
please
him
he
would
have
me
promise
not
again
for
any
vision
or
apparition
whatever
to
leave
the
house
without
his
company
but
he
could
not
persuade
me
he
asked
what
i
would
have
done
if
having
overtaken
the
horseman
i
had
found
neither
my
uncle
nor
death
i
told
him
i
would
have
given
zoe
the
use
of
her
heels
when
horse
would
soon
have
seen
the
last
of
her
at
the
same
time
he
was
inclined
to
believe
with
me
that
i
had
seen
my
uncle
his
intended
proximity
would
account
he
said
for
his
making
no
arrangement
to
hear
from
me
and
if
he
continued
to
haunt
the
moor
in
such
fashion
we
could
not
fail
to
encounter
him
before
long
in
the
meantime
he
thought
it
well
to
show
no
sign
of
suspecting
his
neighbourhood
that
i
had
seen
my
uncle
john
was
for
a
moment
convinced
when
the
very
next
day
having
gone
to
wittenage
he
saw
thanatos
carrying
southwell
my
uncle
friend
on
the
other
hand
thanatos
looked
very
much
alive
and
in
lovely
condition
the
doctor
would
not
confess
to
knowing
anything
about
my
uncle
and
expressed
wonder
that
he
had
not
yet
returned
but
said
he
did
not
mind
how
long
he
had
the
loan
of
such
a
horse
things
went
on
as
before
for
a
while
john
began
again
to
press
me
to
marry
him
i
think
it
was
mainly
i
am
sure
it
was
in
part
that
i
might
never
again
ride
the
midnight
moor
like
a
witch
out
on
her
own
mischievous
hook
as
he
had
once
said
he
knew
that
if
i
caught
sight
of
anything
like
my
uncle
anywhere
john
or
no
john
i
would
go
after
it
there
was
another
good
reason
however
besides
the
absence
of
my
uncle
for
our
not
marrying
john
was
not
yet
of
legal
age
and
who
could
tell
what
might
not
lurk
in
his
mother
threat
who
could
tell
what
such
a
woman
might
not
have
prevailed
on
her
husband
to
set
down
in
his
will
i
was
ready
enough
to
marry
a
poor
man
but
i
was
not
ready
to
let
my
lover
become
a
poor
man
by
marrying
me
a
few
months
sooner
were
we
not
happy
enough
seeing
each
other
everyday
and
mostly
all
day
long
no
doubt
people
talked
but
why
not
let
them
talk
the
mind
of
the
many
is
not
the
mind
of
god
as
to
society
john
called
it
an
oyster
of
a
divinity
he
argued
however
that
probably
my
uncle
was
keeping
close
until
he
saw
us
married
i
answered
that
if
we
were
married
his
mother
would
only
be
the
more
eager
to
have
her
revenge
on
us
all
and
my
uncle
the
more
careful
of
himself
for
our
sakes
anyhow
i
said
i
would
not
consent
to
be
happier
than
we
were
until
we
found
him
the
greater
happiness
i
would
receive
only
from
his
hand
chapter
xxxi
my
uncle
comes
home
time
went
on
and
it
was
now
the
depth
of
a
cold
miserable
winter
i
remember
the
day
to
which
i
have
now
come
so
well
it
was
a
black
day
there
was
such
a
thickness
of
snow
in
the
air
that
what
light
got
through
had
a
lost
look
it
was
almost
more
like
a
london
fog
than
an
honest
darkness
of
the
atmosphere
bred
in
its
own
bounds
but
while
the
light
lasted
the
snow
did
not
fall
i
went
about
the
house
doing
what
i
could
find
to
do
and
wondering
john
did
not
come
his
horse
had
again
fallen
lame
this
time
through
an
accident
which
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
stay
with
the
poor
animal
long
after
his
usual
time
of
starting
to
come
to
me
when
he
did
start
it
was
on
foot
with
the
short
winter
afternoon
closing
in
but
he
knew
the
moor
by
this
time
nearly
as
well
as
i
did
it
was
quite
dark
when
he
drew
near
the
house
which
he
generally
entered
through
the
wilderness
and
the
garden
the
snow
had
begun
at
last
and
was
coming
down
in
deliberate
earnest
it
would
lie
feet
deep
over
the
moor
before
the
morning
he
was
thinking
what
a
dreary
tramp
home
it
would
be
by
the
road
for
the
wind
was
threatening
to
wake
and
in
a
the
moor
was
a
place
to
be
avoided
when
he
struck
his
foot
against
something
soft
in
the
path
his
own
feet
had
worn
to
the
wilderness
and
fell
over
it
a
groan
followed
and
john
rose
with
the
miserable
feeling
of
having
hurt
some
creature
dropping
on
his
knees
to
discover
what
it
was
he
found
a
man
almost
covered
with
snow
and
nearly
insensible
he
swept
the
snow
off
him
contrived
to
get
him
on
his
back
and
brought
him
round
to
the
door
for
the
fence
would
have
been
awkward
to
cross
with
him
just
as
i
began
to
be
really
uneasy
at
his
prolonged
absence
there
he
was
with
a
man
on
his
back
apparently
lifeless
i
did
not
stop
to
stare
or
question
but
made
haste
to
help
him
his
burden
was
slipping
sideways
so
we
lowered
it
on
a
chair
and
then
carried
it
between
us
into
the
kitchen
i
holding
the
legs
the
moment
a
ray
of
light
fell
upon
the
face
i
saw
it
was
my
uncle
i
just
saved
myself
from
a
scream
my
heart
stopped
then
bumped
as
if
it
would
break
through
i
turned
sick
and
cold
we
laid
him
on
the
sofa
but
i
still
held
on
to
the
legs
i
was
half
unconscious
martha
set
me
on
a
chair
and
in
a
moment
or
two
i
came
to
myself
and
was
able
to
help
her
she
said
never
a
word
but
was
quite
collected
looking
every
now
and
then
in
the
face
of
her
cousin
with
a
doglike
devotion
but
never
stopping
an
instant
to
gaze
we
got
him
some
brandy
first
then
some
hot
milk
and
then
some
soup
he
took
a
little
of
everything
we
offered
him
we
did
not
ask
him
a
single
question
but
the
moment
he
revived
carried
him
up
the
stair
and
laid
him
in
bed
once
he
cast
his
eyes
about
and
gave
a
sigh
as
of
relief
to
find
himself
in
his
own
room
then
went
off
into
a
light
doze
which
broken
with
starts
and
lasted
until
next
day
about
noon
either
john
or
martha
or
i
was
by
his
bedside
all
the
time
so
that
he
should
not
wake
without
seeing
one
of
us
near
him
but
the
sad
thing
was
that
when
he
did
wake
he
did
not
seem
to
come
to
himself
he
never
spoke
but
just
lay
and
looked
out
of
his
eyes
if
indeed
it
was
more
than
his
eyes
that
looked
if
indeed
looked
out
of
them
at
all
he
has
overdone
his
strength
we
said
to
each
other
he
has
not
been
taking
care
of
himself
and
then
to
have
lain
perhaps
hours
in
the
snow
it
a
wonder
he
alive
he
nothing
but
skin
and
bone
said
martha
it
will
take
weeks
to
get
him
up
again
and
just
look
at
his
clothes
how
ever
did
he
come
nigh
such
they
fit
only
for
a
beggar
they
must
have
knocked
him
down
and
stripped
him
look
at
his
poor
boots
she
said
pitifully
taking
up
one
of
them
and
stroking
it
with
her
hand
he
never
recover
it
he
will
i
said
here
are
three
of
us
to
give
him
of
our
life
soon
be
himself
again
now
that
we
have
him
but
my
heart
was
like
to
break
at
the
sad
sight
i
can
not
put
in
words
what
i
felt
he
would
get
well
much
quicker
said
john
if
only
we
could
tell
him
we
were
married
it
will
do
just
as
well
to
invite
him
to
the
wedding
i
answered
i
do
hope
he
will
give
you
away
said
martha
he
will
never
give
me
away
i
returned
but
he
will
give
me
to
john
and
i
will
not
have
the
wedding
until
he
is
able
to
do
you
are
right
said
john
and
we
must
ask
him
anything
or
even
refer
to
anything
till
he
wants
to
days
went
and
came
and
still
he
did
not
seem
to
know
quite
where
he
was
if
he
did
know
he
seemed
so
content
with
knowing
it
that
he
did
not
want
to
know
anything
more
in
heaven
or
earth
we
grew
very
anxious
about
him
he
did
not
heed
a
word
that
southwell
said
his
mind
seemed
as
exhausted
as
his
body
the
doctor
justified
john
resolve
saying
he
must
not
be
troubled
with
questions
or
the
least
attempt
to
rouse
his
memory
john
was
now
almost
constantly
with
us
one
day
i
asked
him
whether
his
mother
took
any
notice
of
his
being
now
so
seldom
home
at
night
he
answered
she
did
not
and
but
for
being
up
to
her
ways
he
would
imagine
she
knew
nothing
at
all
about
his
doings
what
does
she
do
herself
all
day
long
i
asked
goes
over
her
books
i
imagine
he
answered
she
knows
the
hour
is
at
hand
when
she
must
render
account
of
her
stewardship
and
i
suppose
she
is
getting
ready
to
meet
it
how
i
would
rather
not
conjecture
she
gives
me
no
trouble
now
and
i
have
no
wish
to
trouble
have
you
no
hope
of
ever
being
on
filial
terms
with
her
again
i
said
there
can
be
few
things
more
unlikely
he
replied
i
was
a
little
troubled
notwithstanding
my
knowledge
of
her
and
my
feeling
toward
her
that
he
should
regard
a
complete
alienation
from
his
mother
with
such
indifference
i
could
not
however
balance
the
account
between
them
if
she
had
a
strong
claim
in
the
sole
fact
that
she
was
his
mother
how
much
had
she
not
injured
him
simply
by
not
being
lovable
love
unpaid
is
the
worst
possible
debt
and
to
make
it
impossible
to
pay
it
is
the
worst
of
wrongs
but
oh
what
a
it
was
that
my
uncle
had
returned
so
different
we
were
glad
to
have
him
but
how
gladly
would
we
not
have
let
him
go
again
to
restore
him
to
himself
even
were
it
never
more
to
rest
our
eyes
upon
him
in
this
world
dearly
as
i
loved
john
it
seemed
as
if
nothing
could
make
me
happy
while
my
uncle
remained
as
he
was
it
was
a
kind
of
cold
despair
to
know
him
such
impassable
miles
from
me
i
could
not
get
near
him
i
went
about
all
day
with
a
sense
not
merely
of
loss
but
of
a
loss
that
gnawed
at
me
with
a
sickening
pain
he
never
spoke
he
never
said
to
me
now
he
never
looked
in
my
eyes
as
if
he
loved
me
he
was
very
gentle
never
complained
never
even
frowned
but
lay
there
with
a
dead
question
in
his
eyes
we
feared
his
mind
was
utterly
gone
by
degrees
his
health
returned
but
apparently
neither
his
memory
nor
his
interest
in
life
yet
he
had
a
look
in
his
eyes
as
if
he
remembered
something
and
started
and
turned
at
every
opening
of
the
door
as
if
he
expected
something
he
took
to
wandering
about
the
yard
and
the
stable
and
the
would
gaze
for
an
hour
at
some
animal
in
its
stall
would
watch
the
men
threshing
the
corn
or
twisting
when
southwell
sent
back
his
horse
it
was
in
great
hope
that
the
sight
of
death
would
wake
him
up
that
he
would
recognize
his
old
companion
jump
on
his
back
and
be
well
again
but
my
uncle
only
looked
at
him
with
a
faint
admiration
went
round
him
and
examined
him
as
if
he
were
a
horse
he
thought
of
buying
then
turned
away
and
left
him
death
was
troubled
at
his
treatment
of
him
he
on
his
part
showed
him
all
the
old
attention
using
every
equine
blandishment
he
knew
but
having
met
with
no
response
he
too
turned
slowly
away
and
walked
to
his
stable
southwell
would
gladly
have
bought
him
but
neither
john
nor
i
would
hear
of
parting
with
him
he
was
almost
a
portion
of
his
master
my
uncle
might
come
to
himself
any
moment
how
could
we
look
him
in
the
face
if
death
was
gone
from
us
besides
we
loved
the
horse
for
his
own
sake
as
well
as
my
uncle
and
john
would
be
but
too
glad
to
ride
him
my
uncle
would
wander
over
the
house
up
and
down
but
seemed
to
prefer
the
little
i
made
it
my
special
business
to
keep
a
good
fire
there
he
never
went
to
the
study
never
opened
the
door
in
the
he
very
seldom
spoke
and
seldomer
to
me
than
to
any
other
it
a
dreary
time
our
very
souls
had
longed
for
him
back
and
thus
he
came
to
us
sorely
i
wept
over
the
change
that
had
passed
upon
the
good
man
he
must
have
received
some
terrible
shock
it
was
just
as
if
his
mother
john
said
had
got
hold
of
him
and
put
a
knife
in
his
heart
it
was
well
however
that
he
was
not
wandering
about
the
heath
exposed
to
the
elements
and
there
was
yet
time
for
many
a
good
thing
to
come
where
one
wait
one
wait
john
had
to
learn
this
for
say
what
he
would
the
idea
of
marrying
while
my
uncle
remained
in
such
plight
was
to
me
unendurable
chapter
xxxii
twice
two
is
one
the
spring
came
but
brought
little
change
in
the
condition
of
my
uncle
in
the
month
of
may
southwell
advised
our
taking
him
abroad
when
we
proposed
it
to
him
he
passed
his
hand
wearily
over
his
forehead
as
if
he
felt
something
wrong
there
and
gave
us
no
reply
we
made
our
preparations
and
when
the
day
arrived
he
did
not
object
to
go
we
were
an
odd
party
john
and
i
bachelor
and
spinster
my
uncle
a
silent
moody
man
who
did
whatever
we
asked
him
and
the
still
martha
moon
who
i
sometimes
think
understood
more
about
it
all
than
any
of
us
i
could
talk
a
little
french
john
a
good
deal
of
german
when
we
got
to
paris
we
found
my
uncle
considerably
at
home
there
when
he
cared
to
speak
he
spoke
like
a
native
and
was
never
at
a
loss
for
word
or
phrase
it
was
he
indeed
who
took
us
to
a
quiet
little
hotel
he
knew
and
when
we
were
comfortably
settled
in
it
he
began
to
take
the
lead
in
all
our
plans
by
degrees
he
assumed
the
care
and
guidance
of
the
whole
party
and
so
well
did
he
carry
out
what
he
had
silently
perhaps
almost
unconsciously
undertaken
that
we
conceived
the
greatest
hopes
of
the
result
to
himself
a
mind
might
lie
quiescent
so
long
as
it
was
ministered
to
and
hedged
from
cares
and
duties
but
wake
up
when
something
was
required
of
it
no
one
would
have
thought
anything
amiss
with
my
uncle
that
heard
him
giving
his
orders
for
the
day
or
acting
cicerone
to
the
little
company
there
for
his
sake
though
he
did
not
know
it
how
often
john
and
i
looked
at
each
other
and
how
glad
were
our
hearts
my
uncle
was
fast
coming
to
himself
it
was
like
watching
the
dead
grow
alive
one
day
he
proposed
taking
a
carriage
and
a
good
pair
of
horses
and
driving
to
versailles
to
see
the
palace
we
agreed
and
all
went
well
i
had
not
in
my
wildest
dreams
imagined
a
place
so
grand
and
beautiful
we
wandered
about
it
for
hours
and
were
just
tired
enough
to
begin
thinking
with
pleasure
of
the
start
homeward
when
we
found
ourselves
in
a
very
long
straight
corridor
i
was
walking
alone
a
little
ahead
of
the
rest
my
uncle
was
coming
along
next
but
a
good
way
behind
me
a
few
paces
behind
my
uncle
came
john
with
martha
to
whom
he
was
more
scrupulously
attentive
than
to
myself
in
front
of
me
was
a
door
dividing
the
corridor
in
two
apparently
filled
with
plain
to
break
the
draught
without
obscuring
the
effect
of
the
great
length
of
the
corridor
which
stretched
away
as
far
on
the
other
side
as
we
had
come
on
this
i
paused
and
stood
aside
leaning
against
the
wall
to
wait
for
my
uncle
and
gazing
listlessly
out
of
a
window
opposite
me
but
as
my
uncle
came
nearer
to
open
the
door
for
us
i
happened
to
cast
my
eyes
again
upon
it
and
saw
as
it
seemed
my
uncle
coming
in
the
opposite
direction
whence
i
concluded
of
course
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
and
that
what
i
had
taken
for
a
clear
plate
of
glass
was
a
mirror
reflecting
the
corridor
behind
me
i
looked
back
at
my
uncle
with
a
little
anxiety
my
reader
may
remember
that
when
he
came
to
fetch
me
from
rising
the
day
after
i
was
lost
on
the
moor
encountering
a
mirror
at
unawares
he
started
and
nearly
fell
from
this
occurrence
and
from
the
absence
of
mirrors
about
the
house
i
had
imagined
in
his
life
some
painful
story
connected
with
a
mirror
once
again
i
saw
him
start
and
then
stand
like
stone
almost
immediately
a
marvellous
light
overspread
his
countenance
and
with
a
cry
he
bounded
forward
i
looked
again
at
the
mirror
and
there
i
saw
the
countenance
coming
straight
as
was
natural
to
meet
that
of
which
it
was
the
reflection
then
all
at
once
the
solid
foundations
of
fact
seemed
to
melt
into
vaporous
dream
for
as
i
saw
the
two
figures
come
together
the
one
in
the
mirror
the
other
in
the
world
and
was
starting
forward
to
prevent
my
uncle
from
shattering
the
mirror
and
wounding
himself
the
figures
fell
into
each
other
arms
and
i
heard
two
voices
weeping
and
sobbing
as
the
substance
and
the
shadow
embraced
two
men
had
for
a
moment
been
deceived
like
myself
neither
glass
nor
mirror
was
there
only
the
frame
from
which
a
had
been
removed
they
walked
each
into
the
arms
of
the
other
whom
they
had
at
first
each
taken
for
himself
they
paused
in
their
weeping
held
each
other
at
and
gazed
as
in
mute
appeal
for
yet
better
assurance
then
smiling
like
two
suns
from
opposing
fell
again
each
on
the
other
neck
and
wept
anew
neither
had
killed
the
other
neither
had
lost
the
other
the
world
had
been
a
graveyard
it
was
a
paradise
we
stood
aside
in
reverence
martha
moon
eyes
glowed
but
she
manifested
no
surprise
john
and
i
stared
in
utter
bewilderment
the
two
embraced
each
other
kissed
and
hugged
and
patted
each
other
wept
and
murmured
and
laughed
then
all
at
once
with
one
great
sigh
between
them
grew
aware
of
witnesses
they
were
too
happy
to
blush
yet
indeed
they
could
not
have
blushed
so
red
were
they
with
the
fire
of
heaven
own
delight
utterly
unembarrassed
they
turned
toward
us
and
then
came
a
fresh
astonishment
an
old
and
new
joy
together
out
of
the
treasure
of
the
divine
the
uncle
of
the
mirror
radiant
with
a
joy
such
as
i
had
never
before
beheld
upon
human
countenance
came
straight
to
me
cried
ah
little
one
took
me
in
his
arms
and
embraced
me
with
all
the
old
tenderness
then
i
knew
that
my
own
old
uncle
was
the
same
as
ever
i
had
known
him
the
same
as
when
i
used
to
go
to
sleep
in
his
arms
the
jubilation
that
followed
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
describe
and
my
husband
who
approves
of
all
i
have
yet
written
begs
me
not
to
attempt
an
adumbration
of
it
it
would
be
a
pity
he
says
to
end
a
won
race
with
a
tumble
down
at
the
post
chapter
xxxiii
half
one
is
one
i
am
going
to
give
you
the
whole
story
but
not
this
moment
i
want
to
talk
a
little
first
i
need
not
say
that
i
had
twin
uncles
they
were
but
one
man
to
the
world
to
themselves
only
were
they
a
veritable
two
the
word
means
one
of
two
that
once
were
one
to
means
to
they
tell
me
the
opposite
action
is
of
to
make
one
to
me
as
well
as
the
world
i
believe
but
for
the
close
individual
contact
of
all
my
life
with
my
uncle
edward
the
two
would
have
been
but
as
one
man
i
hardly
know
that
i
felt
any
richer
at
first
for
having
two
uncles
it
was
long
before
i
should
have
felt
much
poorer
for
the
loss
of
uncle
edmund
uncle
edward
was
to
me
the
substance
of
which
uncle
edmund
was
the
shadow
but
at
length
i
learned
to
love
him
dearly
through
perceiving
how
dearly
my
own
uncle
loved
him
i
loved
the
one
because
he
was
what
he
was
the
other
because
he
was
not
that
one
creative
love
commonly
differentiates
that
it
may
unite
in
the
case
of
my
uncles
it
seemed
only
to
have
divided
that
it
might
unite
i
am
hardly
intelligible
to
myself
in
my
mind
at
least
i
have
got
into
a
bog
of
confused
metaphysics
out
of
which
it
is
time
i
scrambled
what
i
would
say
is
this
that
what
made
the
world
not
care
there
should
be
two
of
them
made
the
earth
a
heaven
to
those
two
by
their
not
being
one
they
were
able
to
love
and
so
were
one
like
twin
planets
they
revolved
around
each
other
and
in
a
common
orbit
around
god
their
sun
it
was
a
beautiful
thing
to
see
how
uncle
edmund
revived
and
expanded
in
the
light
of
his
brother
presence
until
he
grew
plainly
himself
he
had
suffered
more
than
my
own
uncle
and
had
not
had
an
orphan
child
to
love
and
be
loved
by
what
a
drive
home
that
was
paris
anywhere
seemed
home
now
i
had
john
and
my
uncles
john
had
me
and
my
uncle
my
uncles
had
each
other
and
i
suspect
if
we
could
have
looked
into
martha
we
should
have
seen
that
she
through
her
lovely
unselfishness
possessed
us
all
more
than
any
one
of
us
another
oh
the
outbursts
of
gladness
on
the
way
the
talks
the
silences
the
past
fell
off
like
an
ugly
veil
from
the
true
face
of
things
the
present
was
sunshine
the
future
a
rosy
cloud
when
we
reached
our
hotel
it
was
and
john
ordered
champagne
he
and
i
were
hungry
as
two
happy
children
the
brothers
ate
little
and
scarcely
drank
they
were
too
full
of
each
other
to
have
room
for
any
animal
need
a
strange
solemnity
crowned
and
dominated
their
gladness
each
was
to
the
other
a
lazarus
given
back
from
the
grave
but
to
understand
the
depth
of
their
rapture
you
must
know
their
story
that
of
martha
and
mary
and
lazarus
could
not
have
equalled
it
but
for
the
presence
of
the
master
for
neither
sisters
nor
brother
had
done
each
other
any
wrong
they
looked
to
me
like
men
walking
in
a
luminous
mist
a
mist
of
unspeakable
suffering
radiant
with
a
joy
as
unspeakable
the
very
stuff
to
fashion
into
glorious
dreams
when
we
drew
round
the
fire
for
the
evenings
were
chilly
they
laid
their
whole
history
open
to
us
what
a
tale
it
was
and
what
a
telling
of
it
my
own
uncle
edward
was
the
principal
narrator
but
was
occasionally
helped
out
by
my
newer
uncle
edmund
i
had
the
story
already
my
reader
will
remember
in
my
uncle
writing
at
home
when
we
returned
i
read
it
not
with
the
same
absorption
as
if
it
had
come
first
but
with
as
much
interest
and
certainly
with
the
more
thorough
comprehension
that
i
had
listened
to
it
before
that
same
written
story
i
shall
presently
give
supplemented
by
what
necessarily
my
uncle
edmund
had
to
supply
and
with
some
elucidation
from
the
spoken
narrative
of
my
uncle
edward
as
the
story
proceeded
overcome
with
the
horror
of
the
revelation
i
foresaw
i
forgot
myself
and
cried
out
and
that
woman
is
john
mother
whose
mother
asked
uncle
edmund
with
scornful
curiosity
john
day
i
answered
it
can
not
be
he
cried
blazing
up
are
you
sure
of
it
i
have
always
been
given
so
to
understand
replied
john
for
me
but
i
am
by
no
means
sure
of
it
i
have
doubted
it
a
thousand
no
wonder
then
we
may
go
on
but
indeed
to
believe
you
her
son
would
be
to
doubt
you
i
believe
you
could
not
help
doubting
me
responded
john
i
might
be
true
though
even
if
i
were
her
son
he
added
ed
said
edmund
to
edward
let
us
lay
our
heads
together
ready
ed
said
edward
to
edmund
thereupon
they
began
comparing
memories
and
recollections
to
find
however
that
they
had
by
no
means
data
enough
one
thing
was
clear
to
me
that
nothing
would
be
too
bad
for
them
to
believe
of
her
she
would
pick
out
the
eye
of
a
corpse
if
she
thought
a
sovereign
lay
behind
it
said
uncle
edmund
to
have
the
turning
over
of
his
rents
said
uncle
edward
and
checked
himself
yes
it
would
be
just
one
of
her
agreed
uncle
edmund
i
beg
your
pardon
john
said
uncle
edward
as
if
it
were
he
that
had
used
the
phrase
and
uncle
edmund
nodded
to
john
as
if
he
had
himself
made
the
apology
john
said
nothing
his
eyes
looked
wild
with
hope
he
felt
like
one
who
having
been
taught
that
he
is
a
child
of
the
devil
begins
to
know
that
god
is
his
father
the
one
discovery
worth
making
by
son
of
man
then
at
my
request
they
went
on
with
their
story
which
i
had
interrupted
when
it
was
at
length
all
poured
out
and
the
last
drops
shaken
from
the
memory
of
each
there
fell
a
long
silence
which
my
own
uncle
broke
when
shall
we
start
ed
he
said
this
business
of
john
must
come
first
ed
it
shall
ed
you
know
where
you
were
born
john
on
my
father
estate
of
rubworth
in
gloucestershire
i
answered
john
you
must
be
prepared
for
the
worst
you
know
i
am
prepared
as
orba
told
me
once
god
is
my
father
whoever
my
mother
may
be
that
right
hold
by
that
said
my
uncles
as
with
one
breath
do
you
know
the
year
you
were
born
asked
uncle
edmund
my
says
i
was
born
in
you
have
not
seen
the
entry
no
one
does
not
naturally
doubt
such
assuredly
not
until
he
paused
how
uncle
edmund
had
regained
his
wits
and
how
young
the
brothers
looked
you
mean
said
john
until
he
has
known
my
mother
now
for
the
story
of
my
twin
uncles
mainly
as
written
by
my
uncle
edward
chapter
xxxiv
the
story
of
my
twin
uncles
my
brother
and
i
were
marvellously
like
very
few
of
our
friends
none
of
them
with
certainty
could
name
either
of
us
apart
or
even
together
only
two
persons
knew
absolutely
which
either
of
us
was
and
those
two
were
ourselves
our
mother
certainly
did
not
at
least
without
seeing
one
or
other
of
our
backs
even
we
ourselves
have
each
made
the
blunder
occasionally
of
calling
the
other
by
the
wrong
name
our
indistinguishableness
was
the
source
of
mistake
of
constant
amusement
of
frequent
bewilderment
and
sometimes
of
annoyance
in
the
family
i
once
heard
my
father
say
to
a
friend
that
god
had
never
made
two
things
alike
except
his
twins
we
two
enjoyed
the
fun
of
it
so
much
that
we
did
our
best
to
increase
the
confusions
resulting
from
our
resemblance
we
did
not
lie
but
we
dodged
and
pretended
questioned
and
looked
mysterious
till
i
verily
believe
the
person
concerned
having
in
himself
so
vague
an
idea
of
our
individuality
not
unfrequently
forgot
which
he
had
blamed
or
which
he
had
wanted
and
became
hopelessly
muddled
a
man
might
well
have
started
the
question
what
good
could
lie
in
the
existence
of
a
duality
in
which
the
appearance
was
if
not
exactly
yet
so
nearly
identical
that
no
one
but
my
brother
or
myself
could
have
pointed
out
definite
differences
but
it
could
have
been
started
only
by
an
outsider
my
brother
and
i
had
no
doubt
concerning
the
advantage
of
a
duality
in
which
each
was
the
other
double
the
fact
was
to
us
a
never
ceasing
source
of
delight
each
seemed
to
the
other
created
such
expressly
that
he
might
love
him
as
a
special
individual
property
of
his
own
it
was
as
if
the
image
of
narcissus
had
risen
bodily
out
of
the
watery
mirror
to
be
what
it
had
before
but
seemed
it
was
as
if
we
had
been
made
two
that
each
might
love
himself
and
yet
not
be
selfish
we
were
almost
always
together
but
sometimes
we
got
into
individual
scrapes
when
which
will
appear
to
some
incredible
the
one
accused
always
accepted
punishment
without
denial
or
subterfuge
or
attempt
to
perplex
it
was
all
one
which
was
the
culprit
and
which
should
be
the
sufferer
nor
did
this
indistinction
work
badly
that
the
other
was
just
as
likely
to
suffer
as
the
doer
of
the
wrong
wrought
rather
as
a
deterrent
the
mode
of
behaviour
may
have
had
its
origin
in
the
instinctive
perception
of
the
impossibility
of
proving
innocence
but
had
we
loving
as
we
did
been
capable
of
truthfully
accusing
each
other
i
think
we
should
have
been
capable
of
lying
also
the
delight
of
existence
lay
embodied
and
objective
to
each
in
the
existence
of
the
other
at
school
we
learned
the
same
things
and
only
long
after
did
any
differences
in
taste
begin
to
develop
themselves
our
brother
elder
by
five
years
who
would
succeed
to
the
property
had
the
education
my
father
thought
would
best
fit
him
for
the
management
of
land
we
twins
were
trained
to
be
lawyer
and
doctor
i
the
doctor
we
went
to
college
together
and
shared
the
same
rooms
having
finished
our
separate
courses
our
father
sent
us
to
a
german
university
he
would
not
have
us
insular
there
we
did
not
work
hard
nor
was
hard
work
required
of
us
we
went
out
a
good
deal
in
the
evenings
for
the
students
that
lived
at
home
in
the
town
were
hospitable
we
seemed
to
be
rather
popular
owing
probably
to
our
singular
likeness
which
we
found
was
regarded
as
a
serious
disadvantage
the
reason
of
this
opinion
we
never
could
find
flattering
ourselves
indeed
that
what
it
typified
gave
us
each
double
the
base
and
double
the
strength
we
had
all
our
friends
in
common
every
friend
to
one
of
us
was
a
friend
to
both
if
one
met
man
or
woman
he
was
pleased
with
he
never
rested
until
the
other
knew
that
man
or
woman
also
our
delight
in
our
friends
must
have
been
greater
than
that
of
other
men
because
of
the
constant
sharing
our
all
but
identity
of
form
our
inseparability
our
unanimity
and
our
mutual
devotion
were
often
although
we
did
not
know
it
a
subject
of
talk
in
the
social
gatherings
of
the
place
it
was
more
than
once
or
twice
openly
mooted
what
in
the
chances
of
life
would
be
likeliest
to
strain
the
bond
that
united
us
not
a
few
agreed
that
a
terrible
catastrophe
might
almost
be
expected
from
what
they
considered
such
an
unnatural
relation
i
think
you
must
already
be
able
to
foresee
from
what
the
first
difference
between
us
would
arise
discord
itself
was
rooted
in
the
very
unison
for
unison
it
was
not
harmony
of
our
tastes
and
instincts
and
will
now
begin
to
understand
why
it
was
so
difficult
indeed
impossible
for
me
not
to
have
a
secret
from
my
little
one
among
the
persons
we
met
in
the
of
our
appeared
by
and
by
an
english
lady
a
young
widow
they
said
though
little
in
her
dress
or
carriage
suggested
widowhood
we
met
her
again
and
again
each
thought
her
the
most
beautiful
woman
he
had
ever
seen
but
neither
was
much
interested
in
her
at
first
nor
do
i
believe
either
would
of
himself
ever
have
been
our
likings
and
dislikings
always
hitherto
had
gone
together
and
left
to
themselves
would
have
done
so
always
i
believe
whence
it
seems
probable
that
left
to
ourselves
we
should
also
have
found
when
required
a
common
strength
of
abnegation
but
in
the
present
case
our
feelings
were
not
left
to
themselves
the
lady
gave
the
initiative
and
the
dividing
regard
was
born
in
the
one
and
had
time
to
establish
itself
ere
the
provoking
influence
was
brought
to
bear
on
the
other
within
the
last
few
years
i
have
had
a
visit
from
an
old
companion
of
the
period
i
daresay
you
will
remember
the
german
gentleman
who
amused
you
with
the
funny
way
in
which
he
pronounced
certain
words
one
of
the
and
men
i
have
ever
known
he
gave
me
much
unexpected
insight
into
the
evil
affair
he
had
learned
certain
things
from
a
sister
the
knowledge
of
which
old
as
the
story
they
concerned
by
that
time
was
chiefly
moved
his
coming
to
england
to
find
me
one
evening
he
told
me
when
a
number
of
the
ladies
we
were
in
the
habit
of
meeting
happened
to
be
together
without
any
gentleman
present
the
talk
turned
half
in
a
philosophical
half
in
a
gossipy
spirit
upon
the
consequences
that
might
follow
should
two
men
bound
in
such
strange
fashion
as
my
brother
and
i
fall
in
love
with
the
same
woman
a
thing
not
merely
possible
but
to
be
expected
the
talk
my
friend
said
was
full
of
a
certain
speculative
sort
of
metaphysics
which
in
the
present
state
of
human
development
is
far
from
healthy
both
because
of
our
incompleteness
and
because
we
are
too
near
to
what
we
seem
to
know
to
judge
it
aright
one
lady
was
present
a
lady
by
us
more
admired
and
trusted
than
any
of
the
rest
who
alone
declared
a
conviction
that
love
of
no
woman
would
ever
separate
us
provided
the
one
fell
in
love
first
and
the
other
knew
the
fact
before
he
saw
the
lady
for
she
said
no
jealousy
would
in
that
case
be
roused
and
the
relation
of
the
brother
to
his
brother
and
sister
would
be
so
close
as
to
satisfy
his
heart
in
a
few
days
probably
he
too
would
fall
in
love
and
his
lady
in
like
manner
be
received
by
his
brother
when
they
would
form
a
square
impregnable
to
attack
the
theory
was
a
good
one
and
worthy
of
realization
but
alas
the
prince
of
the
power
of
the
air
was
already
present
in
force
in
the
heart
of
the
english
widow
young
in
years
but
old
in
pride
and
she
smiled
at
the
notion
of
our
advocate
she
said
that
the
idea
of
any
such
friendship
between
men
was
nonsense
that
she
knew
more
about
men
than
some
present
could
be
expected
to
know
their
love
was
but
a
matter
of
custom
and
use
the
moment
self
took
part
in
the
play
it
would
burst
it
was
but
a
as
for
love
proper
she
meant
the
love
between
man
and
woman
its
law
was
the
opposite
to
that
of
friendship
its
birth
and
continuance
depended
on
the
parties
getting
accustomed
to
each
other
the
less
they
knew
each
other
the
more
they
would
love
each
other
upon
this
followed
much
confused
talk
during
which
the
english
lady
declared
nothing
easier
than
to
prove
friendship
or
the
love
of
brothers
the
kind
of
thing
she
had
said
most
of
the
company
believed
the
young
widow
but
talking
to
show
off
while
not
a
few
felt
that
they
desired
no
nearer
acquaintance
with
one
whose
words
whatever
might
be
her
thoughts
degraded
humanity
the
circle
was
very
speedily
broken
into
two
segments
one
that
liked
the
english
lady
and
one
that
almost
hated
her
from
that
moment
the
english
widow
set
before
her
the
of
alienating
two
hearts
that
loved
each
other
and
she
gained
it
for
a
time
until
death
proved
stronger
than
the
devil
people
said
we
could
not
be
parted
would
part
us
she
began
with
my
brother
to
tell
how
i
know
that
she
began
with
him
i
should
have
to
tell
how
she
began
with
me
and
that
i
can
not
do
for
little
one
i
dare
not
let
the
tale
of
the
treacheries
of
a
bad
woman
toward
an
unsuspecting
youth
enter
your
ears
suffice
it
to
say
such
a
woman
has
well
studied
those
regions
of
a
man
nature
into
which
being
less
divine
the
devil
in
her
can
easier
find
entrance
there
she
knows
him
better
than
he
knows
himself
and
makes
use
of
her
knowledge
not
to
elevate
but
to
degrade
him
she
fills
him
with
herself
and
her
animal
influences
she
gets
into
his
beside
himself
by
means
of
his
through
the
ever
open
funnel
of
his
she
pours
in
flattery
by
depreciation
of
others
she
hints
admiration
of
himself
by
the
slightest
motion
of
a
finger
of
an
eyelid
of
her
person
she
will
pay
him
a
homage
of
which
first
he
can
not
then
he
will
not
then
he
dares
not
doubt
the
truth
not
such
a
woman
only
but
almost
any
silly
woman
may
speedily
make
the
most
ordinary
and
hitherto
modest
youth
imagine
himself
the
peak
of
creation
the
triumph
of
the
deity
no
man
alive
is
beyond
the
danger
of
imagining
himself
exceptional
among
men
if
such
as
think
well
of
themselves
were
right
in
so
doing
truly
the
world
were
ill
worth
god
making
he
is
the
wisest
who
has
learned
to
naught
awhile
the
silly
soul
becomes
so
full
of
his
tempter
and
of
himself
in
and
through
her
that
he
loses
interest
in
all
else
cares
for
nobody
but
her
prizes
nothing
but
her
regard
broods
upon
nothing
but
her
favours
looks
forward
to
nothing
but
again
her
presence
and
further
favours
god
is
nowhere
in
the
way
like
a
buzzing
fly
else
no
more
to
be
regarded
than
a
speck
of
dust
neither
upon
his
person
nor
his
garment
and
this
terrible
disintegration
of
life
rises
out
of
the
most
wonderful
mysterious
beautiful
and
profound
relation
in
humanity
its
roots
go
down
into
the
very
deeps
of
god
and
out
of
its
foliage
creeps
the
old
serpent
and
the
worm
that
never
dies
out
of
it
steams
the
horror
of
corruption
wrapt
in
whose
living
death
a
man
cries
out
that
god
himself
can
do
nothing
for
him
it
is
but
the
natural
result
of
his
making
the
loveliest
of
god
gifts
into
his
god
and
worshipping
and
serving
the
creature
more
than
the
creator
oh
my
child
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
be
except
he
knows
god
the
saviour
man
stands
face
to
face
with
a
torturing
enigma
hopeless
of
solution
the
woman
sought
and
found
the
enemy
my
false
self
in
the
house
of
my
life
to
that
she
gave
herself
as
if
she
gave
herself
to
me
oh
how
she
made
me
love
her
if
that
be
love
which
is
a
deification
of
self
the
foul
worship
of
one
own
paltry
being
and
that
when
most
it
seems
swallowed
up
and
lost
no
it
is
not
love
does
love
make
ashamed
the
memories
of
it
may
be
full
of
pain
but
can
the
soul
ever
turn
from
love
with
sick
contempt
that
which
at
length
is
loathed
can
never
have
been
loved
of
my
brother
she
would
speak
as
of
a
poor
creature
not
for
a
moment
to
be
compared
with
myself
how
i
could
have
believed
her
true
when
she
spoke
thus
knowing
that
in
the
mirror
i
could
not
have
told
myself
from
my
brother
knowing
also
that
our
minds
tastes
and
faculties
bore
as
strong
a
resemblance
as
our
bodies
i
can
not
tell
but
she
fooled
me
to
a
fool
through
the
indwelling
folly
of
my
at
other
times
wishing
to
tighten
the
bonds
of
my
thraldom
that
she
might
the
better
work
her
evil
end
proving
herself
a
powerful
devil
she
would
rouse
my
jealousy
by
some
sign
of
strong
admiration
of
edmund
she
must
have
acted
the
same
way
with
my
brother
i
saw
him
enslaved
just
as
i
knew
we
were
faring
alike
knew
the
very
thoughts
as
well
as
feelings
in
his
heart
and
instead
of
being
consumed
with
sorrow
chuckled
at
the
that
was
the
favoured
one
i
suspect
now
that
she
showed
him
more
favour
than
myself
and
taught
him
to
put
on
the
look
of
the
hopeless
one
i
fancied
i
caught
at
times
a
covert
flash
in
his
eye
he
knew
what
he
knew
if
so
poor
edmund
thou
hadst
the
worst
of
it
every
way
shall
i
ever
get
her
kisses
off
my
lips
her
poison
out
of
my
brain
from
my
heart
her
image
was
burned
in
a
moment
as
utterly
as
if
by
years
of
hell
the
estrangement
between
us
was
sudden
there
were
degrees
only
in
the
widening
of
it
first
came
embarrassment
at
meeting
then
all
commerce
of
wish
thought
and
speculation
ended
there
was
no
more
merrymaking
jugglery
with
identity
each
was
himself
only
and
for
himself
alone
gone
was
all
we
avoided
each
other
more
and
more
when
we
must
meet
we
made
haste
to
part
heaven
was
gone
from
home
each
yet
felt
the
same
way
toward
the
other
but
it
was
the
way
of
repelling
not
drawing
when
we
passed
in
the
street
it
was
with
a
look
that
said
or
at
least
meant
are
my
brother
i
do
want
you
we
ceased
even
to
nod
to
each
other
still
in
our
separation
we
could
not
separate
each
took
a
room
in
another
part
of
the
town
but
under
the
same
pseudonym
our
common
lodging
was
first
deserted
then
formally
given
up
by
each
always
what
one
did
that
did
the
other
though
no
longer
intending
to
act
in
consort
with
him
he
could
not
help
it
though
he
tried
for
the
other
tried
also
and
did
the
same
thing
one
of
us
might
for
months
have
played
the
part
of
both
without
detection
especially
if
it
had
been
understood
that
we
had
parted
company
but
i
think
it
was
never
suspected
although
now
we
were
rarely
for
a
moment
together
and
still
more
rarely
spoke
a
few
weeks
sufficed
to
bring
us
to
the
verge
of
madness
to
this
day
i
doubt
if
the
woman
our
common
disease
knew
the
one
of
us
from
the
other
that
in
any
part
of
her
being
there
was
the
least
approach
to
a
genuine
womanly
interest
in
either
of
us
i
do
not
believe
i
am
very
sure
she
never
cared
for
me
preference
i
can
not
think
possible
she
could
not
it
seems
to
me
have
felt
anything
for
one
of
us
without
feeling
the
same
for
both
i
do
not
see
how
with
all
she
knew
of
us
we
could
have
made
two
impressions
upon
her
moral
sensorium
it
was
at
length
the
height
of
summer
and
every
one
sought
change
of
scene
and
air
it
was
time
for
us
to
go
home
but
i
wrote
to
my
father
and
got
longer
i
wrote
too
interposed
my
uncle
edmund
at
this
point
of
the
story
when
my
own
uncle
was
telling
it
that
evening
in
paris
the
day
after
the
date
of
his
answer
to
my
letter
my
father
died
but
edmund
and
i
were
already
on
our
way
by
different
routes
to
the
whither
the
lady
had
preceded
us
and
having
in
our
infatuation
left
no
address
my
brother
never
saw
the
letter
announcing
our
loss
and
i
not
for
months
a
few
weeks
more
and
our
elder
brother
who
had
always
been
delicate
followed
our
father
this
also
remained
for
a
time
unknown
to
me
my
mother
had
died
many
years
before
and
we
had
now
scarce
a
relation
in
the
world
martha
moon
is
the
nearest
relative
you
and
i
have
besides
her
and
you
there
were
left
therefore
of
the
family
but
myself
and
your
uncle
edmund
both
absorbed
in
the
same
worthless
woman
at
the
village
there
were
two
hostelries
i
thought
my
brother
would
go
to
the
better
he
thought
i
would
go
to
the
better
so
we
met
at
the
worse
i
remember
a
sort
of
grin
on
his
face
when
we
saw
each
other
and
have
no
doubt
the
same
grin
was
on
mine
we
always
did
the
same
thing
just
as
of
old
the
next
morning
we
set
out
i
need
hardly
say
each
by
himself
to
find
the
lady
she
had
rented
a
small
chalet
on
the
banks
of
a
swift
and
thither
for
a
week
or
so
we
went
every
day
often
encountering
the
efforts
we
made
to
avoid
each
other
being
similar
and
simultaneous
they
oftener
resulted
in
our
meeting
when
one
did
nothing
the
other
generally
did
nothing
also
and
when
one
schemed
the
other
also
schemed
and
similarly
thus
what
had
been
the
greatest
pleasure
of
our
peculiar
relation
our
mental
and
moral
resemblance
namely
became
a
large
factor
in
our
mutual
hate
for
with
shame
and
a
misery
that
makes
me
curse
the
day
i
was
born
i
confess
that
for
a
time
i
hated
the
brother
of
my
heart
and
i
have
but
too
good
ground
for
believing
that
he
also
hated
me
i
did
i
did
cried
uncle
edmund
when
my
own
uncle
in
his
verbal
narrative
mentioned
his
belief
that
his
brother
hated
him
whereupon
uncle
edward
turned
to
me
saying
is
it
not
terrible
my
little
one
that
out
of
a
passion
called
by
the
same
name
with
that
which
binds
you
and
john
day
the
hellish
smoke
of
such
a
hate
should
arise
god
must
understand
it
that
is
a
comfort
in
vain
i
seek
to
sound
it
even
then
i
knew
that
i
dwelt
in
an
evil
house
amid
the
highest
of
such
hopes
as
the
woman
roused
in
me
i
scented
the
vapours
of
the
pit
i
was
haunted
by
the
dim
shape
of
the
coming
hour
when
i
should
hate
the
woman
that
enthralled
me
more
than
ever
i
had
loved
her
the
greater
sinner
i
am
that
i
yet
yielded
her
dominion
over
me
i
was
the
willing
slave
of
a
woman
who
sought
nothing
but
the
consciousness
of
power
who
to
the
indulgence
of
that
vilest
of
passions
would
sacrifice
the
lives
the
loves
the
very
souls
of
men
she
lived
to
separate
where
jesus
died
to
make
one
how
weak
and
unworthy
was
i
to
be
caught
in
her
snares
how
wicked
and
vile
not
to
tear
myself
loose
the
woman
whose
touch
would
defile
the
pharisee
is
pure
beside
such
a
woman
i
return
to
his
manuscript
the
lady
must
have
had
plenty
of
money
and
she
loved
company
and
show
i
can
not
but
think
therefore
that
she
had
her
design
in
choosing
such
a
solitary
place
its
loveliness
would
subserve
her
intent
of
enthralling
thoroughly
heart
and
soul
and
brain
of
the
fools
she
had
in
her
toils
i
doubt
however
if
the
fools
were
alive
to
any
beauty
but
hers
if
they
were
not
dead
to
the
wavings
of
god
garment
about
them
was
i
ever
truly
aware
of
the
presence
of
those
peaks
that
dwelt
alone
with
their
whiteness
in
the
desert
of
the
sky
awfully
alone
of
the
world
but
not
with
the
world
i
think
we
saw
nothing
save
with
our
bodily
eyes
and
very
little
with
them
for
we
were
blinded
by
a
passion
fitter
to
wander
the
halls
of
eblis
than
the
palaces
of
god
the
chalet
stood
in
a
little
valley
high
in
the
mountains
whose
surface
was
gently
undulating
with
here
and
there
the
rocks
breaking
through
its
meadows
down
the
middle
of
it
ran
the
deep
swift
stream
swift
with
the
weight
of
its
fullness
as
well
as
the
steep
slope
of
its
descent
it
was
not
more
than
seven
or
eight
feet
across
but
a
great
body
of
water
went
rushing
along
its
deep
course
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
chalet
it
reached
the
first
of
a
series
of
falls
of
moderate
height
and
slope
after
which
it
divided
into
a
number
of
channels
mostly
shallow
in
a
wide
pebbly
these
a
little
lower
down
reunited
into
a
narrower
and
yet
swifter
stream
a
small
fierce
river
which
presently
at
one
reckless
bound
shot
into
the
air
to
tumble
to
a
valley
a
thousand
feet
below
shattered
into
spray
as
it
fell
the
chalet
stood
alone
the
village
was
at
no
great
distance
but
not
a
house
was
visible
from
any
of
its
windows
it
had
no
garden
the
meadow
one
blaze
of
colour
softened
by
the
green
of
the
mingling
grass
came
up
to
its
wooden
walls
and
stretched
from
them
down
to
the
rocky
bank
of
the
river
in
many
parts
to
the
very
the
chalet
stood
like
a
yellow
rock
in
a
green
sea
the
meadow
was
the
where
the
lady
generally
received
us
one
lovely
evening
i
strolled
out
of
the
hostelry
and
went
walking
up
the
road
that
led
to
the
village
of
auerbach
so
named
from
the
stream
and
the
meadow
i
have
described
the
moon
was
up
and
promised
the
loveliest
night
i
was
in
no
haste
for
the
lady
had
in
our
common
hearing
said
she
was
going
to
pass
that
night
with
a
friend
in
a
town
some
ten
miles
away
i
dawdled
along
therefore
thinking
only
to
greet
the
place
walk
with
the
stream
and
lie
in
the
meadow
sacred
with
the
shadow
of
her
demonian
presence
quit
of
the
restless
hope
of
seeing
her
i
found
myself
taking
some
little
pleasure
in
the
things
about
me
and
spent
two
hours
on
the
way
amid
the
sound
of
rushing
water
now
swelling
now
sinking
all
the
time
it
had
not
crossed
me
to
wonder
where
my
brother
might
be
i
banished
the
thought
of
him
as
often
as
it
intruded
not
able
to
help
meeting
we
had
almost
given
up
avoiding
each
other
but
when
we
met
our
desire
was
to
part
i
do
not
know
that
apart
we
had
ever
yet
felt
actual
hate
either
to
the
other
the
road
led
through
the
village
it
was
asleep
i
remember
a
gleam
in
just
one
of
the
houses
the
moonlight
seemed
to
have
drowned
all
the
lamps
of
the
world
i
came
to
the
stream
rushing
cold
from
its
crossed
it
and
went
down
the
bank
opposite
the
chalet
i
had
taken
a
fancy
to
see
it
from
that
side
glittering
and
glancing
under
the
moon
the
wild
little
river
rushed
joyous
to
its
fearful
fall
a
short
distance
away
it
was
even
now
falling
falling
from
off
the
face
of
the
world
this
moment
it
was
falling
from
my
very
feet
into
the
void
falling
falling
unupheld
down
down
through
the
moonlight
to
the
ghastly
below
the
chalet
seemed
deserted
with
the
same
woefully
desolate
look
it
constantly
comes
back
in
my
dreams
i
went
farther
down
the
valley
the
stream
went
with
me
like
a
dog
it
made
no
murmur
only
a
low
gurgle
as
it
shot
along
it
seemed
to
draw
me
with
it
to
its
last
leap
as
i
looked
at
its
swiftness
i
thought
how
hard
it
would
be
to
get
out
of
the
swiftness
of
it
comes
to
me
yet
in
my
dreams
i
came
to
a
familiar
rock
which
part
of
the
bank
whereon
i
walked
rose
some
six
or
seven
feet
above
the
meadow
just
opposite
a
little
hollow
where
the
lady
oftenest
sat
two
were
on
the
grass
together
one
a
lady
seated
the
other
a
man
with
his
head
in
the
lady
lap
i
gave
a
leap
as
if
a
bullet
had
gone
through
my
heart
then
instinctively
drew
back
behind
the
rock
there
i
came
to
myself
and
began
to
take
courage
she
had
gone
away
for
the
night
it
could
not
be
she
i
peeped
the
man
had
raised
his
head
and
was
leaning
on
his
elbow
it
was
edmund
i
was
certain
she
stooped
and
kissed
him
i
scrambled
to
the
top
of
the
rock
and
sprang
across
the
stream
which
ran
below
me
like
a
flooded
millrace
would
to
god
i
had
missed
the
bank
and
been
swept
to
the
great
fall
i
was
careless
and
when
i
lighted
i
fell
her
clear
mocking
laugh
rang
through
the
air
and
echoed
from
the
scoop
of
some
still
mountain
when
i
rose
they
were
on
their
feet
a
remarked
the
lady
with
derision
she
saw
the
last
moment
was
come
neither
of
us
two
spoke
told
you
she
said
of
you
was
to
trouble
me
you
have
paid
no
regard
to
my
wish
for
quiet
it
is
time
the
foolery
should
end
i
am
weary
of
it
a
woman
can
not
marry
a
double
man
or
half
a
man
either
without
at
least
being
able
to
tell
which
is
which
of
the
two
halves
she
ended
with
a
toneless
laugh
in
which
my
brother
joined
she
turned
upon
him
with
a
pitiless
mockery
which
i
see
now
must
have
left
in
his
mind
the
conviction
that
she
had
been
but
making
game
of
him
while
i
never
doubted
myself
the
dupe
not
once
had
she
received
me
as
i
now
saw
her
though
the
night
was
warm
her
deshabille
was
yet
a
somewhat
prodigal
unmasking
of
her
beauty
to
the
moon
the
conviction
in
each
of
us
was
that
she
and
the
other
were
laughing
at
him
we
locked
in
a
deadly
struggle
with
what
object
i
can
not
tell
i
do
not
believe
either
of
us
had
an
object
it
was
a
mere
blind
conflict
of
pointless
enmity
in
which
each
cared
but
to
overpower
the
other
which
first
laid
hold
which
if
either
began
to
drag
i
have
not
a
suspicion
the
next
thing
i
know
is
we
were
in
the
water
each
in
the
grasp
of
the
other
now
rolling
now
sweeping
now
tumbling
along
in
deadly
embrace
the
shock
of
the
water
and
the
sense
of
our
danger
brought
me
to
myself
i
let
my
brother
go
but
he
clutched
me
still
down
we
shot
together
toward
the
sheer
descent
already
we
seemed
falling
the
terror
of
it
me
it
was
not
the
crash
i
feared
but
the
stayless
rush
through
the
whistling
emptiness
in
the
agony
of
my
despair
i
pushed
him
from
me
with
all
my
strength
striking
at
him
a
fierce
wild
aimless
blow
the
only
blow
struck
in
the
wrestle
his
hold
relaxed
i
remember
nothing
at
this
point
of
the
verbal
narrative
my
uncle
edmund
again
spoke
you
never
struck
me
ed
he
cried
or
if
you
did
i
was
already
senseless
i
remember
nothing
of
the
when
i
came
to
myself
the
manuscript
goes
on
i
was
lying
in
a
pebbly
shoal
the
moon
was
aloft
in
heaven
i
was
cold
to
the
heart
cold
to
the
marrow
of
my
bones
i
could
move
neither
hand
nor
foot
and
thought
i
was
dead
by
slow
degrees
a
little
power
came
back
and
i
managed
at
length
after
much
agonizing
effort
to
get
up
on
my
feet
only
to
fall
again
after
several
such
failures
i
found
myself
capable
of
dragging
myself
along
like
a
serpent
and
so
got
out
of
the
water
and
on
the
next
endeavour
was
able
to
stand
i
had
forgotten
everything
but
when
my
eyes
fell
on
the
darting
torrent
i
remembered
all
not
as
a
fact
but
as
a
terrible
dream
from
which
i
thanked
heaven
i
had
come
awake
but
as
i
tottered
along
i
came
slowly
to
myself
and
a
fearful
doubt
awoke
if
it
was
a
dream
where
had
i
dreamt
it
how
had
i
come
to
wake
where
i
found
myself
how
had
the
dream
turned
real
about
me
where
was
i
last
in
my
remembrance
where
was
my
brother
where
was
the
lady
in
the
moonlight
no
it
was
not
a
dream
if
my
brother
had
not
got
out
of
the
water
i
was
his
murderer
i
had
struck
him
oh
the
horror
of
it
if
only
i
could
stop
dreaming
it
three
times
almost
every
night
again
uncle
edmund
interposed
not
altogether
logically
i
tell
you
i
do
believe
you
struck
me
ed
and
you
must
remember
neither
of
us
would
have
got
out
if
you
had
you
might
have
let
me
go
said
the
other
on
the
way
down
the
degenfall
perhaps
rejoined
uncle
edmund
i
believe
it
was
that
blow
brought
me
to
my
senses
and
made
me
get
out
thank
you
ed
said
uncle
edward
once
more
i
write
from
the
manuscript
i
said
to
myself
he
have
got
out
it
could
not
be
that
i
had
drowned
my
own
brother
such
a
ghastly
thing
could
not
have
been
permitted
it
was
too
terrible
to
be
possible
how
then
had
we
been
living
the
last
few
months
what
brothers
had
we
been
had
we
been
loving
one
another
had
i
been
a
neighbour
to
my
nearest
had
i
been
a
brother
to
my
twin
was
not
murder
the
natural
outcome
of
it
all
he
that
loveth
not
his
brother
is
a
murderer
if
so
where
the
good
of
saving
me
from
being
in
deed
what
i
was
in
nature
i
had
cast
off
my
brother
for
a
treacherous
woman
my
very
thought
sickened
within
me
my
soul
seemed
to
grow
luminous
and
understand
everything
i
saw
my
whole
behaviour
as
it
was
the
scales
fell
from
my
inward
eyes
and
there
came
a
sudden
total
and
absolute
revulsion
in
my
conscious
self
like
what
takes
place
i
presume
at
the
day
of
judgment
when
the
god
in
every
man
sits
in
judgment
upon
the
man
had
the
gate
of
heaven
stood
wide
open
neither
angel
with
flaming
sword
nor
peter
with
the
keys
to
dispute
my
entrance
i
would
have
turned
away
from
it
and
sought
the
deepest
hell
i
loathed
the
woman
and
myself
in
my
heart
the
sealed
fountain
of
old
affection
had
broken
out
and
flooded
it
all
the
time
this
thinking
went
on
i
was
crawling
slowly
up
the
endless
river
toward
the
chalet
driven
by
a
hope
inconsistent
with
what
i
knew
of
my
brother
what
i
felt
he
if
he
were
alive
must
be
feeling
also
how
then
could
i
say
to
myself
that
i
should
find
him
with
her
it
was
the
last
dying
hope
that
i
had
not
killed
him
that
thus
fooled
me
will
be
warming
him
in
her
bosom
i
said
but
at
the
very
touch
the
idea
turned
and
presented
its
opposite
pole
god
i
cried
in
my
heart
shall
i
compass
his
deliverance
better
he
lay
at
the
bottom
of
the
fall
than
lived
to
be
devoured
by
that
serpent
of
hell
i
will
go
straight
to
the
den
of
the
monster
and
demand
my
brother
but
to
see
the
eyes
of
uncle
edmund
at
this
point
of
the
story
at
last
i
approached
the
chalet
all
was
still
a
handkerchief
lay
on
the
grass
white
in
the
moonlight
i
went
up
to
it
hoping
to
find
it
my
brother
it
was
the
lady
i
flung
it
from
me
like
a
filthy
rag
what
was
the
passion
worth
which
in
a
moment
could
die
so
utterly
i
turned
to
the
house
i
would
tear
him
from
her
he
was
mine
not
hers
my
wits
were
nigh
gone
i
thought
the
moonlight
was
dissolving
the
chalet
that
the
two
within
might
escape
me
i
held
it
fast
with
my
eyes
the
moon
drew
back
she
only
possessed
and
filled
it
no
the
moon
was
too
pure
she
but
shone
reflected
from
the
windows
she
would
not
go
in
would
go
in
i
was
justice
the
woman
was
a
thief
she
had
broken
into
the
house
of
life
and
was
stealing
i
stood
for
a
moment
looking
up
at
her
window
there
was
neither
motion
nor
sound
was
she
gone
away
and
my
brother
with
her
could
she
be
in
bed
and
asleep
after
seeing
us
swept
down
the
river
to
the
degenfall
could
he
be
with
her
and
at
rest
believing
me
dashed
to
pieces
i
must
be
resolved
the
door
was
not
bolted
i
stole
up
the
stair
to
her
chamber
the
door
of
it
was
wide
open
i
entered
and
stood
the
moon
filled
the
tiny
room
with
a
clear
light
she
lay
asleep
lovely
to
look
at
as
an
angel
of
god
her
hair
part
of
it
thrown
across
the
of
the
little
iron
bed
streamed
out
on
each
side
over
the
pillow
and
in
the
midst
of
it
lay
her
face
a
radiant
isle
in
a
dark
sea
i
stood
and
gazed
fascinated
by
her
beauty
god
forbid
i
was
fascinated
by
the
awful
incongruity
between
that
face
pure
as
the
moonlight
and
the
that
lay
unseen
behind
it
she
was
to
me
henceforth
not
a
woman
but
a
live
death
i
had
no
sense
of
sacredness
such
as
always
in
the
chamber
even
of
a
little
girl
how
should
i
it
was
no
chamber
it
was
a
den
she
was
no
woman
but
a
female
monster
i
stood
and
gazed
my
presence
was
more
potent
than
i
knew
she
opened
her
eyes
opened
them
straight
into
mine
all
the
colour
sank
away
out
of
her
face
and
it
stiffened
to
that
of
a
corpse
with
the
staring
eyes
of
one
strangled
she
lay
as
motionless
as
i
stood
i
moved
not
an
inch
spoke
not
a
word
drew
not
a
step
nearer
retreated
not
a
motion
was
taken
from
me
was
it
hate
that
fixed
my
eyes
on
hers
and
turned
my
limbs
into
marble
it
certainly
was
not
love
but
neither
was
it
hate
agony
had
been
burrowing
in
me
like
a
mole
the
half
of
what
i
felt
i
have
not
told
you
i
came
to
find
my
brother
and
found
only
in
a
sweet
sleep
the
woman
who
had
just
killed
him
the
bewilderment
of
it
all
with
my
long
insensibility
and
wet
garments
had
taken
from
me
either
the
power
of
motion
or
of
volition
i
do
not
know
which
speechless
in
the
moonlight
i
must
have
looked
to
the
wretched
woman
both
ghostly
and
ghastly
two
or
three
long
moments
she
gazed
with
those
eyes
then
a
frightful
shriek
broke
from
her
drawn
lips
she
who
could
sleep
after
turning
love
into
hate
life
into
death
would
have
fled
into
hell
to
escape
the
eyes
of
the
dead
insensibility
is
not
courage
wake
in
the
scornfullest
mortal
the
conviction
that
one
of
the
disembodied
stands
before
him
and
he
will
shiver
like
an
scream
followed
scream
volition
or
strength
whichever
it
was
that
had
left
me
returned
i
backed
from
the
room
went
noiseless
from
the
house
and
fled
as
if
she
had
been
the
ghost
and
i
the
mortal
would
i
had
been
the
spectre
for
which
she
took
me
here
uncle
edward
again
spoke
small
wonder
she
screamed
the
wretch
he
cried
that
was
her
second
dose
of
the
horrible
that
night
you
found
the
door
unbolted
because
i
had
been
there
before
you
i
too
entered
her
room
and
saw
her
asleep
as
you
describe
i
went
close
to
her
bedside
and
cried
out
is
my
brother
she
woke
and
fainted
and
i
left
then
said
i
when
she
came
to
herself
thinking
she
had
had
a
bad
dream
she
rearranged
her
hair
and
went
to
sleep
again
just
so
i
daresay
little
one
answered
uncle
edward
i
had
not
yet
begun
to
think
what
i
should
do
when
i
found
myself
at
our
little
inn
the
manuscript
continues
no
idea
of
danger
to
myself
awoke
in
my
mind
nor
was
there
any
cause
to
heed
such
an
idea
had
it
come
nobody
there
knew
the
one
from
the
other
of
us
not
many
would
know
there
were
two
of
us
any
one
who
saw
me
twice
might
well
think
he
had
seen
us
both
if
my
brother
body
were
found
in
the
valley
stream
it
was
not
likely
to
be
recognized
or
to
be
indeed
recognizable
the
only
one
who
could
tell
what
happened
at
the
top
of
the
fall
would
hardly
volunteer
information
but
while
i
knew
myself
my
brother
murderer
i
thought
no
more
of
these
sheltering
facts
than
i
did
of
danger
i
made
it
no
secret
that
my
brother
had
gone
over
the
fall
i
went
to
the
foot
of
the
cataract
thence
to
search
and
inquire
all
down
the
stream
but
no
one
had
heard
of
any
dead
body
being
found
they
told
me
that
the
poor
gentleman
must
before
morning
have
been
far
on
his
way
to
the
danube
giving
up
the
quest
in
despair
i
resigned
myself
to
a
torture
which
has
hitherto
come
no
nearer
expending
itself
than
the
consuming
fire
of
god
i
dared
not
carry
home
the
terrible
news
which
must
either
involve
me
in
lying
or
elicit
such
confession
as
would
multiply
tenfold
my
anguish
and
was
in
utter
perplexity
what
to
do
when
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
ought
to
inquire
after
letters
at
the
lodging
where
last
we
had
lived
together
then
first
i
learned
that
both
my
father
and
my
elder
brother
your
father
little
one
were
dead
the
sense
of
guilt
had
not
destroyed
in
me
the
sense
of
duty
i
did
not
care
what
became
of
the
property
but
i
did
care
for
my
brother
child
and
the
interests
of
her
succession
your
father
had
all
his
life
been
delicate
and
had
suffered
not
a
little
when
your
mother
died
about
a
year
after
their
marriage
leaving
us
you
it
soon
grew
plain
to
see
that
while
he
loved
you
dearly
and
was
yet
more
friendly
to
all
about
him
than
before
his
heart
had
given
up
the
world
when
i
knew
he
was
gone
i
shed
more
tears
over
him
than
i
had
yet
shed
over
my
twin
the
worm
that
never
dies
made
my
brain
too
hot
to
weep
much
for
edmund
then
first
i
saw
that
my
elder
brother
had
been
a
brother
indeed
and
that
we
twins
had
never
been
real
to
each
other
i
saw
what
nothing
but
would
ever
have
brought
me
to
see
that
my
love
to
edmund
had
not
been
profound
while
a
man
is
himself
shallow
how
should
his
love
be
deep
i
saw
that
we
had
each
loved
our
elder
brother
in
a
truer
and
better
fashion
than
we
had
loved
each
other
one
of
the
chief
active
bonds
between
us
had
been
fun
another
habit
and
another
constitutional
resemblance
not
one
of
them
strong
underneath
were
bonds
far
stronger
but
they
had
never
come
into
conscious
play
no
strain
had
reached
them
they
were
there
i
say
for
wherever
is
the
poorest
flower
of
love
it
is
there
in
virtue
of
the
perfect
root
of
love
and
love
root
must
one
day
blossom
into
perfect
rose
my
chief
consolation
under
the
burden
of
my
guilt
is
that
i
love
my
brother
since
i
killed
him
far
more
than
i
loved
him
when
we
were
all
to
each
other
had
we
never
quarrelled
and
were
he
alive
i
should
not
be
loving
him
thus
that
we
shall
meet
again
and
live
in
the
devotion
of
a
far
deeper
love
i
feel
in
the
very
heart
of
my
soul
that
it
is
my
miserable
need
that
has
wrought
in
me
this
confidence
is
no
argument
against
the
confidence
as
misery
alone
sees
miracles
so
is
there
many
a
truth
into
which
misery
alone
can
enter
my
little
one
do
not
pity
your
uncle
much
i
have
learned
to
lift
up
my
heart
to
god
i
look
to
him
who
is
the
saviour
of
men
to
deliver
me
from
to
lead
me
into
my
pardon
and
enable
me
somehow
to
make
up
to
him
for
the
wrong
i
did
him
some
would
think
i
ought
to
give
myself
up
to
justice
but
i
felt
and
feel
that
i
owe
my
brother
reparation
not
my
country
the
opportunity
of
retribution
it
can
not
be
demanded
of
me
to
pretermit
because
of
my
crime
the
duty
more
strongly
required
of
me
because
of
the
crime
must
i
not
use
my
best
endeavour
to
turn
aside
its
evil
consequences
from
others
was
i
were
it
even
for
the
cleansing
of
my
vile
soul
to
leave
the
child
of
my
brother
alone
with
a
property
exposing
her
to
the
machinations
of
prowling
selfishness
would
it
atone
for
the
wrong
of
depriving
her
of
one
uncle
to
take
the
other
from
her
and
so
leave
her
defenceless
with
a
burden
she
could
not
carry
must
i
take
justice
on
myself
at
her
expense
to
the
oppression
darkening
and
endangering
of
her
life
were
i
accused
i
would
tell
the
truth
but
i
would
not
volunteer
a
phantasmal
atonement
what
comfort
would
it
be
to
my
brother
that
i
was
hanged
let
the
punishment
god
pleased
come
upon
me
i
said
as
far
as
lay
in
me
i
would
live
for
my
brother
child
i
have
lived
for
her
but
i
am
and
have
been
and
shall
i
trust
throughout
my
earthly
time
and
what
time
thereafter
may
be
needful
always
be
in
purgatory
i
should
tremble
at
the
thought
of
coming
out
of
it
a
moment
ere
it
had
done
its
part
one
day
after
my
return
home
as
i
unpacked
a
portmanteau
my
fingers
slipped
into
the
pocket
of
a
waistcoat
and
came
upon
something
which
when
i
brought
it
to
the
light
proved
a
large
ruby
a
pang
went
to
my
heart
i
looked
at
the
waistcoat
and
found
it
the
one
i
had
worn
that
terrible
night
the
ruby
was
the
stone
of
the
ring
edmund
always
wore
it
must
have
been
loose
and
had
got
there
in
our
struggle
every
now
and
then
i
am
drawn
to
look
at
it
at
first
i
saw
in
it
only
the
blood
now
i
see
the
light
also
the
moon
of
hope
rises
higher
as
the
sun
of
life
approaches
the
horizon
i
was
never
questioned
about
the
death
of
my
twin
brother
one
of
two
so
like
must
seem
enough
our
resemblance
i
believe
was
a
bore
which
the
teasing
use
we
made
of
it
aggravated
therefore
the
fact
that
there
was
no
longer
a
pair
of
us
could
not
be
regarded
as
cause
for
regret
and
things
quickly
settled
down
to
the
state
in
which
you
so
long
knew
them
if
there
be
one
with
a
suspicion
of
the
terrible
truth
it
is
cousin
martha
you
will
not
be
surprised
that
you
should
never
have
heard
of
your
uncle
edmund
i
dare
not
ask
you
my
child
not
to
love
me
less
for
perhaps
you
ought
to
do
so
if
you
do
i
have
my
consolation
in
the
fact
that
my
little
one
can
not
make
me
love
thus
ended
the
manuscript
signed
with
my
uncle
name
and
address
in
full
and
directed
to
me
at
the
bottom
of
the
last
page
chapter
xxxv
uncle
edmund
appendix
when
my
uncle
edward
had
told
his
story
corresponding
though
more
conversational
in
form
with
that
i
have
now
transcribed
my
uncle
edmund
took
up
his
part
of
the
tale
from
the
moment
when
he
came
to
himself
after
their
fearful
rush
down
the
river
it
was
to
this
effect
he
lay
on
the
very
verge
of
the
hideous
void
how
it
was
that
he
got
thus
far
and
no
farther
he
never
could
think
he
was
out
of
the
central
channel
and
the
water
that
ran
all
about
him
and
poured
immediately
over
the
edge
of
the
precipice
could
not
have
sufficed
to
roll
him
there
finding
himself
on
his
back
and
trying
to
turn
on
his
side
in
order
to
rise
his
elbow
found
no
support
and
lifting
his
head
a
little
he
looked
down
into
a
abyss
where
thin
silvery
vapours
were
stealing
about
one
turn
and
he
would
have
been
on
his
way
to
the
valley
below
say
rather
on
his
way
off
the
face
of
the
world
into
the
vast
that
bosoms
the
stars
and
the
systems
and
the
cloudy
worlds
his
very
soul
quivered
with
terror
the
pang
of
it
was
so
keen
that
it
saved
him
from
the
swoon
in
which
he
might
yet
have
dropped
from
the
edge
of
the
world
not
daring
to
rise
and
unable
to
roll
himself
up
the
slight
slope
he
shifted
himself
sideways
along
the
ground
inch
by
inch
for
a
few
yards
then
rose
and
ran
staggering
away
as
from
a
monster
that
might
wake
and
pursue
and
overtake
him
he
doubted
if
he
would
ever
have
recovered
the
sudden
shock
of
his
awful
position
of
his
one
glance
into
the
ghastly
depth
but
for
the
worse
horror
of
the
that
his
brother
had
gone
down
to
hades
through
that
terrible
descent
if
only
he
too
had
gone
he
cried
in
his
misery
they
would
now
be
together
with
no
wicked
woman
between
their
hearts
for
his
love
too
was
changed
into
loathing
he
too
was
at
once
and
entirely
and
for
ever
freed
from
her
fascination
the
very
thought
of
her
was
hateful
to
him
with
straight
course
but
wavering
walk
he
made
his
way
through
the
moonlight
to
demand
his
brother
he
too
picked
up
the
handkerchief
and
dropped
it
with
disgust
what
followed
in
the
lady
chamber
i
have
already
given
in
his
own
words
when
he
fled
from
the
chalet
it
was
with
in
his
heart
but
he
endured
in
the
comfort
of
the
thought
that
the
door
of
death
was
always
open
that
he
might
enter
when
he
would
he
sought
the
foot
of
the
fall
the
same
night
then
as
one
possessed
of
demons
to
the
tombs
fled
to
the
solitary
places
of
the
dark
mountains
he
went
through
many
a
sore
stress
ignorant
of
the
death
of
his
father
and
his
elder
brother
the
dread
misery
of
encountering
them
with
his
brother
blood
on
his
soul
barred
his
way
home
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
reading
in
their
eyes
his
own
horror
of
himself
his
money
was
soon
spent
and
for
months
he
had
to
endure
severe
hardships
of
simple
wholesome
human
sort
he
thought
afterward
that
if
he
had
had
no
trouble
of
that
kind
his
brain
would
have
yielded
he
would
have
surrendered
himself
but
for
the
uselessness
of
it
and
the
misery
and
public
stare
it
would
bring
upon
his
family
knowing
german
well
and
contriving
at
length
to
reach
berlin
he
found
employment
there
of
various
kinds
and
for
a
good
many
years
managed
to
live
as
well
as
he
had
any
heart
for
and
spare
a
little
for
some
worse
off
than
himself
having
no
regard
to
his
health
however
he
had
at
length
a
terrible
attack
of
and
but
partially
recovering
his
faculties
after
it
was
placed
in
an
asylum
there
he
dreamed
every
night
of
his
home
came
awake
with
the
joy
of
the
dream
and
could
sleep
no
more
for
longing
not
to
go
home
that
he
dared
not
think
of
but
to
look
upon
the
place
if
only
once
again
the
longing
grew
till
it
became
intolerable
by
his
talk
in
his
sleep
the
good
people
about
him
learning
his
condition
gave
and
gathered
money
to
send
him
home
on
his
way
he
came
to
himself
quite
but
when
he
reached
england
he
found
he
dared
not
go
near
the
place
of
his
birth
he
remained
therefore
in
london
where
he
made
the
barest
livelihood
by
copying
legal
documents
in
this
way
he
spent
a
few
miserable
years
and
then
suddenly
set
out
to
walk
to
the
house
of
his
fathers
he
had
but
five
shillings
in
his
possession
when
the
impulse
came
upon
him
he
reached
the
moor
and
had
fallen
exhausted
when
a
solitary
gypsy
rare
phenomenon
i
presume
with
a
divine
spot
awake
in
his
heart
found
him
gave
him
some
gin
and
took
him
to
a
hut
he
had
in
the
wildest
part
of
the
heath
he
lay
helpless
for
a
week
and
then
began
to
recover
when
he
was
sufficiently
restored
he
helped
his
host
to
weave
the
baskets
which
as
soon
as
he
had
enough
to
make
a
load
he
took
about
the
country
in
a
cart
he
soon
became
so
clever
at
the
work
as
quite
to
earn
his
food
and
shelter
making
more
baskets
while
the
gypsy
was
away
selling
the
others
at
home
the
old
horse
managed
to
live
or
rather
not
to
die
on
the
moor
and
all
things
considered
had
not
a
very
hard
life
of
it
on
his
back
uncle
edmund
ill
able
to
walk
so
far
for
he
was
anything
but
strong
now
would
sometimes
go
wandering
in
the
twilight
or
when
the
moon
shone
to
some
spot
whence
he
could
see
his
old
home
occasionally
he
would
even
go
round
and
round
the
house
while
we
slept
like
a
ghost
dreaming
of
ancient
days
but
i
said
interrupting
his
narrative
the
horseman
i
saw
that
night
in
the
storm
could
not
have
been
you
uncle
for
the
horse
was
a
grand
creature
rearing
like
the
horse
with
peter
the
great
on
his
back
in
the
corner
of
the
map
of
russia
were
out
that
terrible
night
he
returned
the
lightning
was
enough
to
frighten
even
an
older
horse
than
the
i
wonder
how
my
friend
is
getting
on
he
must
think
me
very
ungrateful
but
i
daresay
he
imagines
me
lying
in
the
you
will
do
something
for
him
wo
you
ed
you
shall
do
for
him
yourself
what
you
please
ed
answered
my
own
uncle
and
i
will
help
but
uncle
edmund
i
said
if
it
was
you
we
saw
the
place
you
were
in
was
a
very
boggy
one
always
and
nearly
a
lake
then
i
thought
i
should
never
get
out
he
replied
but
for
the
poor
horse
and
his
owner
i
should
not
have
how
you
get
out
of
it
uncle
i
persisted
lady
cairnedge
smothered
a
splendid
black
horse
not
far
from
there
through
the
darkness
i
heard
him
going
down
it
makes
me
shudder
every
time
i
think
of
i
can
not
tell
you
child
i
suppose
my
gray
was
such
a
skeleton
that
the
bog
could
hold
him
i
left
it
all
to
him
and
he
got
himself
and
me
too
out
of
it
somehow
it
was
too
dark
as
you
know
to
see
anything
between
the
flashes
i
remember
we
were
pretty
deep
he
went
back
to
london
after
that
and
had
come
and
gone
once
or
twice
he
said
when
he
came
he
always
lodged
with
his
gypsy
friend
he
had
learned
that
his
father
was
dead
but
took
the
whichcote
he
heard
mentioned
for
his
elder
brother
david
my
father
i
asked
him
how
it
was
he
appeared
to
such
purpose
and
in
the
very
nick
of
time
that
afternoon
when
lady
cairnedge
had
come
with
her
servants
to
carry
john
away
for
of
course
i
knew
now
that
our
champion
must
have
been
uncle
edmund
he
answered
he
had
that
very
morning
made
up
his
mind
to
present
himself
at
the
house
and
had
walked
there
for
the
purpose
resolved
to
tell
his
brother
all
he
got
in
by
the
end
of
the
garden
as
john
was
in
the
way
of
doing
and
had
reached
the
little
grove
of
firs
by
the
house
when
he
saw
a
carriage
at
the
door
and
drew
back
hearing
then
the
noises
of
attack
and
defence
he
came
to
the
window
and
looked
in
heard
lady
cairnedge
shriek
saw
her
on
the
floor
and
the
men
attempting
to
force
an
entrance
at
the
other
side
of
the
window
hardly
knowing
what
he
did
he
rushed
at
them
and
beat
them
off
then
suddenly
turning
faint
for
his
heart
was
troublesome
he
retired
into
the
grove
and
lay
there
helpless
for
a
time
he
recovered
only
to
hear
the
carriage
drive
away
leaving
quiet
behind
it
to
see
that
woman
in
the
house
of
his
fathers
was
a
terrible
shock
to
him
could
it
be
that
david
had
married
her
he
stole
from
his
covert
and
crawled
across
the
moor
to
the
gypsy
hut
there
he
was
consoled
by
learning
that
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
a
young
girl
whom
he
rightly
concluded
to
be
the
daughter
of
his
brother
david
in
making
a
second
visit
with
the
same
intent
he
had
another
attack
of
the
heart
and
now
knew
that
he
would
have
died
in
the
snow
had
not
john
found
him
chapter
xxxvi
the
end
of
the
first
volume
we
returned
to
england
the
next
day
all
the
journey
through
my
uncles
were
continually
reverting
to
the
matter
of
john
parentage
the
more
they
saw
of
him
the
less
could
they
believe
lady
cairnedge
his
mother
through
questions
put
to
him
and
inquiries
afterward
made
they
discovered
that
when
he
went
to
london
he
had
gone
to
lady
lawyer
not
his
father
of
whom
he
had
never
heard
which
accounted
for
his
having
on
that
occasion
learned
nothing
of
consequence
to
him
when
we
reached
london
my
uncle
edmund
who
having
been
bred
a
lawyer
knew
how
to
act
went
at
once
to
examine
the
will
left
by
john
father
that
done
he
set
out
for
the
place
where
john
was
born
the
rest
of
us
went
home
the
second
day
after
our
arrival
there
uncle
edmund
came
he
had
found
perfect
proof
not
only
that
lady
cairnedge
was
john
but
that
she
had
no
authority
over
him
or
his
property
whatever
a
long
discussion
took
place
in
my
uncles
study
i
have
to
shift
the
apostrophe
of
possession
as
to
whether
john
ought
to
compel
restitution
of
what
she
might
have
wrongfully
spent
or
otherwise
appropriated
she
had
been
left
an
income
by
each
of
her
husbands
upon
either
of
which
incomes
she
might
have
lived
at
ease
but
they
had
a
strong
suspicion
soon
entirely
justified
that
while
spending
john
money
she
had
been
saving
up
far
more
than
her
own
but
in
the
discussion
john
held
to
it
that
as
she
had
once
been
the
wife
of
his
father
he
would
spare
her
so
far
provided
she
had
nowise
impoverished
either
of
the
estates
he
would
insist
only
upon
her
immediate
departure
yes
little
one
said
my
uncle
one
summer
evening
as
he
and
i
talked
together
seated
alone
in
the
wilderness
what
we
call
misfortune
is
always
the
only
good
fortune
few
will
say
in
response
but
truth
is
independent
of
supporters
being
justified
by
her
children
until
found
us
he
went
on
my
brother
and
i
had
indeed
loved
one
another
but
with
a
love
so
poor
that
a
wicked
woman
was
able
to
send
it
to
sleep
to
what
she
might
have
brought
us
had
she
had
full
scope
god
only
knows
all
the
women
in
hell
could
not
separate
us
and
all
the
women
in
paradise
would
but
bring
you
closer
i
ventured
to
add
the
day
after
our
marriage
which
took
place
within
a
month
of
our
return
from
paris
john
went
to
rising
on
a
visit
to
lady
cairnedge
of
anything
but
ceremony
and
took
his
uncles
and
myself
with
him
will
you
tell
her
ladyship
he
said
to
the
footman
that
day
desires
to
see
the
man
would
have
shut
the
door
in
our
faces
with
the
words
i
will
see
if
my
lady
is
at
home
but
john
was
prepared
for
him
he
put
his
foot
between
the
door
and
the
jamb
and
his
two
hands
against
the
door
driving
it
to
the
wall
with
the
man
behind
it
there
he
held
him
till
we
were
all
in
then
closed
the
door
and
said
to
him
in
a
tone
i
had
never
heard
him
use
till
that
moment
let
lady
cairnedge
know
at
once
that
day
desires
to
see
the
man
went
we
walked
into
the
white
the
same
where
i
sat
alone
among
the
mirrors
the
morning
after
i
was
lost
on
the
moor
how
well
i
remembered
it
there
we
waited
the
gentlemen
stood
but
john
insisting
i
sat
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
by
which
we
had
entered
in
a
few
minutes
however
a
slight
sound
in
another
part
of
the
room
caused
me
to
turn
them
thitherward
there
stood
lady
cairnedge
in
a
with
a
whip
in
her
hand
staring
pale
as
death
at
my
uncles
then
with
a
scornful
laugh
she
turned
and
went
through
a
door
immediately
behind
her
which
closed
instantly
and
became
part
of
the
wainscot
hardly
distinguishable
john
darted
to
it
it
was
bolted
on
the
outside
he
sought
another
door
and
ran
hither
and
thither
through
the
house
to
find
the
woman
my
uncles
ran
after
him
afraid
something
might
befall
him
i
remained
where
i
was
far
from
comfortable
two
or
three
minutes
passed
and
then
i
heard
the
thunder
of
hoofs
i
ran
to
the
window
there
she
was
tearing
across
the
park
at
full
gallop
on
just
such
a
huge
black
horse
as
she
had
smothered
in
the
bog
i
was
the
only
one
of
us
that
saw
her
and
not
one
of
us
ever
set
eyes
upon
her
again
when
we
went
over
the
house
it
soon
became
plain
to
us
that
she
had
been
in
readiness
for
a
sudden
retreat
having
prepared
for
it
after
a
fashion
of
her
own
not
a
single
small
article
of
value
was
to
be
discovered
in
it
john
who
left
him
the
property
died
in
the
house
possessed
of
a
large
number
of
jewels
many
of
them
of
great
price
both
in
themselves
and
because
of
their
antiquity
not
one
of
them
was
ever
found
a
report
reached
us
long
after
that
lady
cairnedge
was
found
dead
in
her
bed
in
a
hotel
in
the
tyrol
my
uncles
lived
for
many
years
on
the
old
farm
uncle
edmund
bought
a
gray
horse
as
like
uncle
edward
as
he
could
find
one
only
younger
i
often
wondered
what
death
must
think
to
know
he
had
his
master
on
his
back
and
yet
see
him
mounted
by
his
side
every
day
one
or
the
other
most
days
both
would
ride
across
the
moor
to
see
us
for
many
years
martha
walked
in
at
the
door
at
least
once
every
week
my
uncles
took
no
pains
for
they
had
no
desire
to
be
distinguished
the
one
from
the
other
each
was
always
ready
to
meet
any
obligation
of
the
other
if
one
made
an
appointment
few
could
tell
which
it
was
and
nobody
which
would
keep
it
no
one
could
tell
except
perhaps
one
who
had
been
present
which
of
them
had
signed
any
document
their
two
hands
were
absolutely
indistinguishable
i
do
not
believe
either
of
them
after
a
time
always
himself
knew
whether
the
name
was
his
or
his
brother
he
could
only
be
always
certain
it
must
have
been
written
by
one
of
them
but
each
indifferently
was
ready
to
honour
the
signature
they
died
within
a
month
of
each
other
their
bodies
lie
side
by
side
on
their
one
tombstone
is
the
inscription
here
lie
the
disused
garments
of
edward
and
edmund
whichcote
born
died
june
and
july
they
are
not
here
they
are
risen
john
and
i
are
waiting
belorba
day
