there
are
over
a
thousand
footnotes
in
the

that
were
added
by
the

most
of
these
are
very
short
biographical
and
similar

and
have
been
inserted
into
the

in
square
brackets
close
to
the
point
where
they
were
originally
referred
to
by
a

a
few
of
the
longer

have
been
given

which
has
also
been

as
this
was
not
possible
in
the
etext
years
have
been
added
to
the
first
entry
for
each
month
to
make
it
easier
for
readers
to
keep
track
of
the
year
because
the
calendar
was
in
use
at
the
time
the
diary
was
written
in
which
the
new
year
began
on
march
the

has
been
given
a
dual
number
in

february
and

has
been
done
elsewhere
in
the

eg
during
the
first
months
of
pepys
spelling
and
punctuation
have
been
left

they
were

classics
preface
to
the
present
edition
the
celebrated
work
here
presented
to
the
public
under
peculiar
advantages
may
require
a
few
introductory
remarks
by
the
publication
during
the
last
half
century
of
autobiographies
diaries
and
records
of
personal
character
this
class
of
literature
has
been
largely
enriched
not
only
with
works
calculated
for
the
benefit
of
the
student
but
for
that
larger
class
of
readers
the
people
who
in
the
byeways
of
history
and
biography
which
these
works
present
gather
much
of
the
national
life
at
many
periods
and
pictures
of
manners
and
customs
habits
and
amusements
such
as
are
not
so
readily
to
be
found
in
more
elaborate
works
the
diary
and
correspondence
of
john
evelyn
published
in
the
year
is
the
first
of
the
class
of
books
to
which
special
reference
is
here
made
this
was
followed
by
the
publication
in
of
the
diary
and
correspondence
of
samuel
pepys
a
work
of
a
more
entertaining
character
than
that
of
evelyn
there
is
moreover
another
distinction
between
the
two
the
diary
of
pepys
was
written
at
the
end
of
each
succeeding
day
whereas
the
diary
of
evelyn
is
more
the
result
of
leisure
and
thought
and
partakes
more
of
the
character
of
history
pepys
account
of
the
great
fire
of
london
in
is
full
as
minute
as
that
of
evelyn
but
it
is
mingled
with
a
greater
number
of
personal
and
official
circumstances
of
popular
interest
the
scene
of
dismay
and
confusion
which
it
exhibits
is
almost
beyond
parallel
it
is
observed
and
is
true
in
the
late
fire
of
london
says
pepys
that
the
fire
burned
just
as
many
parish
churches
as
there
were
hours
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
fire
and
next
that
there
were
just
as
many
churches
left
standing
in
the
rest
of
the
city
that
was
not
burned
being
i
think
thirteen
in
all
of
each
which
is
pretty
to
observe
again
pepys
was
at
this
time
clerk
of
the
acts
of
the
navy
his
house
and
office
were
in
crutched
friars
he
was
called
up
at
three
in
the
morning
by
his
maid
jane
and
so
rose
and
slipped
on
his
nightgown
and
went
to
her
window
but
thought
the
fire
far
enough
off
and
so
went
to
bed
again
and
to
sleep
next
morning
jane
told
him
that
she
heard
above
houses
had
been
burnt
down
by
the
fire
they
saw
and
that
it
was
then
burning
down
all
by
london
bridge
so
pepys
writes
i
made
myself
ready
presently
and
walked
to
the
tower
and
there
got
upon
one
of
the
high
places
and
saw
the
houses
at
that
end
of
the
bridge
all
on
fire
and
an
infinite
great
fire
at
the
other
end
of
the
bridge
on
he
notes
about
two
in
the
morning
my
wife
calls
me
up
and
tells
me
of
new
cries
of
fire
it
being
come
to
barking
church
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
our
lane
the
fire
was
however
stopped
as
well
at
end
as
ours
it
having
only
burned
the
dyall
of
barking
church
and
part
of
the
porch
and
there
was
quenched
this
narrative
has
all
the
advantage
of
being
written
at
the
time
of
the
event
which
kind
of
record
has
been
pronounced
preferable
to
a
load
of
pencillings
of
this
very
attractive
particularity
is
the
diary
of
pepys
which
is
here
submitted
to
the
reader
in
the
most
elegant
and
economical
as
well
as
complete
form
of
the
origin
of
this
work
details
are
given
the
accompanying
preface
by
the
noble
editor
lord
braybrooke
the
diarist
secretary
pepys
was
a
great
virtuoso
in
collections
of
english
history
both
by
land
and
sea
much
relating
to
the
admiralty
and
maritime
affairs
he
gathered
very
much
from
records
in
the
tower
had
many
fine
models
and
new
inventions
of
ships
and
historical
paintings
of
them
had
many
books
of
mathematics
and
other
sciences
many
very
costly
curiosities
relating
to
the
city
of
london
as
views
maps
palaces
churches
coronations
funerals
mayoralties
habits
heads
of
all
our
famous
men
drawn
as
well
as
painted
the
most
complete
collection
of
anything
of
its
kind
he
was
a
man
whose
free
and
generous
spirit
appeared
in
his
pen
and
his
ingenious
fancy
at
his
finger
end
the
original
of
the
diary
which
gives
so
vivid
a
picture
of
manners
in
the
reign
of
charles
is
preserved
in
magdalene
college
cambridge
it
is
in
six
volumes
containing
upwards
of
pages
closely
written
in
rich
system
of
shorthand
which
pepys
doubtless
adopted
from
the
possibility
of
his
journal
falling
into
unfriendly
hands
during
his
life
or
being
rashly
communicated
to
the
public
after
his
death
the
original
spelling
of
every
word
in
the
diary
it
is
believed
has
been
carefully
preserved
by
the
gentleman
who
deciphered
it
and
although
pepys
grammar
has
been
objected
to
it
is
thought
that
the
entries
derive
additional
interest
from
the
quaint
terms
in
which
they
are
expressed
the
period
of
the
diary
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
and
eventful
decades
in
our
history
we
have
here
the
joyous
pictures
of
the
restoration
as
well
as
much
about
the
merry
monarch
his
gaieties
and
his
intrigues
the
plague
of
with
the
appalling
episodes
of
this
national
calamity
is
followed
by
the
record
of
the
great
fire
and
the
rebuilding
of
london
then
what
an
attractive
period
is
that
of
the
history
of
the
london
theatres
dating
from
the
restoration
with
piquant
sketches
of
the
actors
and
actresses
of
that
day
pepys
in
his
love
of
wit
and
admiration
of
beauty
finds
room
to
love
and
admire
nell
gwyn
whose
name
still
carries
an
odd
fascination
with
it
after
so
many
generations
in
those
busy
times
were
new
and
we
find
pepys
dropping
in
at
will
where
he
never
was
before
and
where
he
saw
dryden
and
all
the
wits
of
the
town
the
diarist
records
sending
for
a
cup
of
tea
a
china
drink
he
had
not
before
tasted
here
we
find
the
earliest
account
of
a
lord
mayor
dinner
in
the
guildhall
and
wood
pepys
old
house
for
clubbing
in
pell
mell
all
pictures
in
little
of
social
life
with
innumerable
traits
of
statesmen
politicians
wits
and
poets
authors
artists
and
actors
and
men
and
women
of
wit
and
pleasure
such
as
the
town
court
and
city
have
scarcely
presented
at
any
other
period
shortly
after
the
publication
of
the
diary
there
appeared
in
the
quarterly
review
no
a
charming
paper
from
the
accomplished
pen
of
sir
walter
scott
upon
this
very
curious
contribution
to
our
reminiscent
literature
sir
walter
parallel
of
pepys
and
evelyn
is
very
nicely
drawn
early
necessity
made
pepys
laborious
studious
and
careful
but
his
natural
propensities
were
those
of
a
man
of
pleasure
he
appears
to
have
been
ardent
in
quest
of
amusement
especially
where
anything
odd
or
uncommon
was
to
be
witnessed
to
this
thirst
after
novelty
the
consequence
of
which
has
given
great
and
varied
interest
to
his
diary
pepys
added
a
love
of
public
amusements
which
he
himself
seems
to
have
considered
as
excessive
our
diarist
must
not
be
too
severely
judged
he
lived
in
a
time
when
the
worst
examples
abounded
a
time
of
court
intrigue
and
state
revolution
when
nothing
was
certain
for
a
moment
and
when
all
who
were
possessed
of
any
opportunity
to
make
profit
used
it
with
the
most
shameless
avidity
lest
the
golden
minutes
should
pass
away
unimproved
in
quitting
the
broad
path
of
history
says
sir
walter
we
seek
for
minute
information
concerning
ancient
manners
and
customs
the
progress
of
arts
and
sciences
and
the
various
branches
of
antiquity
we
have
never
seen
a
mine
so
rich
as
the
volumes
before
us
the
variety
of
pepys
tastes
and
pursuits
led
him
into
almost
every
department
of
life
he
was
a
man
of
business
a
man
of
information
if
not
of
learning
a
man
of
taste
a
man
of
whim
and
to
a
certain
degree
a
man
of
pleasure
he
was
a
statesman
a
bel
esprit
a
virtuoso
and
a
connoisseur
his
curiosity
made
him
an
unwearied
as
well
as
an
universal
learner
and
whatever
he
saw
found
its
way
into
his
tables
thus
his
diary
absolutely
resembles
the
genial
cauldrons
at
the
wedding
of
camacho
a
souse
into
which
was
sure
to
bring
forth
at
once
abundance
and
variety
of
whatever
could
gratify
the
most
eccentric
appetite
if
the
curious
affect
dramatic
antiquities
a
line
which
has
special
charms
for
the
present
age
no
book
published
in
our
time
has
thrown
so
much
light
upon
plays
playwrights
and
actors
then
those
who
desire
to
be
aware
of
the
earliest
discoveries
as
well
in
sciences
as
in
the
useful
arts
may
read
in
memoirs
how
a
slice
of
roast
mutton
was
converted
into
pure
blood
and
of
those
philosophical
glass
crackers
which
explode
when
the
tail
is
broken
off
rupert
drops
of
aurum
fulminans
applied
to
the
purpose
of
blowing
ships
out
of
the
water
and
of
a
newly
contrived
gun
which
was
to
change
the
whole
system
of
the
art
of
war
but
which
has
left
it
pretty
much
upon
the
old
footing
a
lover
of
antique
scandal
which
taketh
away
the
character
and
committeth
scandalum
magnatum
against
the
nobility
of
the
seventeenth
century
will
find
in
this
work
an
untouched
treasure
of
curious
anecdote
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
preface
to
the
original
edition
in
submitting
the
following
pages
to
the
public
i
feel
that
it
is
incumbent
upon
me
to
explain
by
what
circumstances
the
materials
from
which
the
work
has
been
compiled
were
placed
at
my
disposal
the
original
diary
comprehending
six
volumes
closely
written
in
by
pepys
himself
belonged
to
the
valuable
collection
of
books
and
prints
bequeathed
by
him
to
magdalene
college
cambridge
and
had
remained
there
unexamined
till
the
appointment
of
my
brother
the
present
master
under
whose
auspices
the
was
deciphered
by
john
smith
with
a
view
to
its
publication
my
brother
time
however
being
too
much
engrossed
by
more
important
duties
to
admit
of
his
editing
the
work
the
task
of
preparing
it
for
the
press
was
undertaken
by
me
at
his
request
the
diary
commences
january
and
after
being
regularly
kept
for
ten
years
it
is
brought
to
a
sudden
conclusion
owing
to
the
weak
state
of
pepys
eyes
which
precluded
him
from
continuing
or
resuming
the
occupation
as
he
was
in
the
habit
of
recording
the
most
trifling
occurrences
of
his
life
it
became
absolutely
necessary
to
curtail
the
materially
and
in
many
instances
to
condense
the
matter
but
the
greatest
care
has
been
taken
to
preserve
the
original
meaning
without
making
a
single
addition
excepting
where
from
the
being
defective
some
alteration
appeared
absolutely
necessary
it
may
be
objected
by
those
who
are
not
aware
how
little
is
known
from
authentic
sources
of
the
history
of
the
stage
about
the
period
of
the
restoration
that
the
notices
of
theatrical
performances
occur
too
frequently
but
as
many
of
the
incidents
recorded
connected
with
this
subject
are
not
to
be
met
with
elsewhere
i
thought
myself
justified
in
retaining
them
at
the
risk
of
fatiguing
those
readers
who
have
no
taste
for
the
concerns
of
the
drama
the
general
details
may
also
in
some
instances
even
in
their
abridged
form
be
considered
as
too
minute
nor
is
it
an
easy
task
in
an
undertaking
of
this
sort
to
please
everybody
taste
my
principal
study
in
making
the
selection
however
has
been
to
omit
nothing
of
public
interest
and
to
introduce
at
the
same
time
a
great
variety
of
other
topics
less
important
perhaps
put
tending
in
some
degree
to
illustrate
the
manners
and
habits
of
the
age
in
justice
to
pepys
literary
reputation
the
reader
is
forewarned
that
he
is
not
to
expect
to
find
in
the
diary
accuracy
of
style
or
finished
composition
we
should
rather
consider
the
work
as
a
collection
of
reminiscences
hastily
thrown
together
at
the
end
of
each
succeeding
day
for
the
exclusive
perusal
of
the
author
the
journal
contains
the
most
unquestionable
evidences
of
veracity
and
as
the
writer
made
no
scruple
of
committing
his
most
secret
thoughts
to
paper
encouraged
no
doubt
by
the
confidence
which
he
derived
from
the
use
of
perhaps
there
never
was
a
publication
more
implicitly
to
be
relied
upon
for
the
authenticity
of
its
statements
and
the
exactness
with
which
every
fact
is
detailed
upon
this
point
i
can
venture
to
speak
with
the
less
hesitation
having
in
preparing
the
sheets
for
the
press
had
occasion
to
compare
many
parts
of
the
diary
with
different
accounts
of
the
same
transactions
recorded
elsewhere
and
in
no
instance
could
i
detect
any
material
error
or
wilful
misrepresentation
the
notes
at
the
bottom
of
the
pages
were
introduced
to
elucidate
obscure
passages
and
i
have
been
tempted
occasionally
to
insert
short
biographical
sketches
of
the
principal
persons
who
are
named
accompanied
by
such
references
as
will
enable
the
curious
reader
to
inform
himself
more
fully
respecting
them
in
some
instances
i
experienced
considerable
difficulty
in
identifying
the
individuals
but
i
trust
that
the
notices
will
be
found
on
the
whole
sufficiently
correct
to
answer
the
object
intended
in
justice
to
the
reverend
john
smith
with
whom
i
am
not
personally
acquainted
it
may
be
added
that
he
appears
to
have
performed
the
task
allotted
to
him
of
deciphering
the
diary
with
diligence
and
fidelity
and
to
have
spared
neither
time
nor
trouble
in
the
undertaking
the
best
account
of
pepys
occurs
in
the
supplement
to
collier
historical
dictionary
published
soon
after
his
death
and
written
as
i
have
reason
to
believe
by

most
probably
in
london
but
by
some
it
is
thought
at
brampton
he
certainly
passed
his
boyish
days
in
the
metropolis
and
was
educated
regularly
at
school
and
afterwards
at
the
university
of
cambridge
and
probably
went
through
his
studies
with
success
but
little
is
known
of
him
as
an
undergraduate
one
record
however
remains
which
proves
that
in
his
early
life
as
in
later
years
he
was
a
bon
vivant
the
following
appears
in
the
register
book
of
the
college
respecting
his
pranks
when
there
october
mem
that
peapys
and
hind
were
solemnly
admonished
by
myself
and
hill
for
having
been
scandalously
with
drink
ye
night
before
this
was
done
in
the
presence
of
all
the
fellows
then
resident
in
hill
chamber
signed
john
wood
registrar
early
in
life
pepys
took
one
of
those
decided
steps
which
tend
according
to
circumstances
to
a
man
marring
or
making
he
appears
to
have
married
elizabeth
michel
a
beautiful
girl
of
fifteen
when
he
himself
was
only
about
three
she
was
of
good
family
her
mother
being
descended
from
the
cliffords
of
cumberland
and
her
daughter
had
only
just
quitted
the
convent
in
which
she
was
educated
she
brought
her
husband
no
fortune
but
the
patronage
of
pepys
relation
sir
edward
montagu
afterwards
first
earl
of
sandwich
prevented
the
ill
consequences
with
such
a
step
might
naturally
have
been
attended
and
young
pepys
aptitude
for
business
soon
came
to
render
him
useful
the
distresses
of
the
young
couple
at
this
period
were
subjects
of
pleasant
reflexion
during
their
prosperity
as
recorded
in
the
diary
february
but
better
times
were
approaching
pepys
he
accompanied
sir
edward
montagu
upon
his
expedition
to
the
sound
in
march
and
upon
his
return
obtained
a
clerkship
in
the
exchequer
through
the
interest
of
the
earl
of
sandwich
pepys
was
nominated
clerk
of
the
acts
this
was
the
commencement
of
his
connexion
with
a
great
national
establishment
to
which
in
the
sequel
his
diligence
and
acuteness
were
of
the
highest
service
from
his
papers
still
extant
says
lord
braybrooke
we
gather
that
he
never
lost
sight
of
the
public
good
that
he
spared
no
pains
to
check
the
rapacity
of
contractors
by
whom
the
naval
stores
were
then
supplied
that
he
studied
order
and
economy
in
the
dockyards
advocated
the
promotion
of
officers
in
the
navy
and
resisted
to
the
utmost
the
infamous
system
of
selling
places
then
most
unblushingly
practised
his
zeal
and
industry
acquired
for
him
the
esteem
of
the
duke
of
york
with
whom
as
lord
high
admiral
he
had
almost
daily
intercourse
at
the
time
of
his
entering
upon
this
employment
he
resided
in
crutched
friars
he
continued
in
this
office
till
and
during
those
great
events
the
plague
the
fire
of
london
and
the
dutch
war
the
care
of
the
navy
in
a
great
measure
rested
upon
pepys
alone
he
behaved
with
calm
and
deliberate
courage
and
integrity
nevertheless
he
had
the
misfortune
to
experience
some
part
of
the
calumnies
of
the
time
of
the
popish
plot
the
earl
of
shaftesbury
the
of
this
most
wicked
delusion
showed
a
great
desire
to
implicate
pepys
in
a
charge
of
catholicism
and
went
so
far
as
to
spread
a
report
that
the
clerk
of
the
acts
had
in
his
house
an
altar
and
a
crucifix
the
absence
not
only
of
evidence
but
even
of
ground
of
suspicion
did
not
prevent
pepys
being
committed
to
the
tower
on
the
charge
of
being
an
aider
and
abettor
of
the
plot
and
he
was
for
a
time
removed
from
the
navy
board
he
was
afterwards
allowed
with
sir
anthony
deane
who
had
been
committed
with
him
to
find
security
in
and
upon
the
withdrawal
of
the
deposition
against
him
he
was
discharged
he
was
soon
by
the
special
command
of
charles
replaced
in
a
situation
where
his
skill
and
experience
could
not
be
well
dispensed
with
and
rose
afterwards
to
be
secretary
of
the
admiralty
which
office
he
retained
till
the
revolution
it
is
remarkable
that
james
ii
was
sitting
to
sir
godfrey
kneller
for
a
portrait
designed
as
a
present
to
pepys
when
the
news
of
the
landing
of
the
prince
of
orange
was
brought
to
that
unhappy
monarch
the
king
commanded
the
painter
to
proceed
and
finish
the
portrait
that
his
good
friend
might
not
be
disappointed
pepys
had
been
too
much
personally
connected
with
the
king
who
had
been
so
long
at
the
admiralty
to
retain
his
situation
upon
the
accession
of
william
and
mary
and
he
retired
into
private
life
accordingly
but
without
being
followed
thither
either
by
persecution
or
ill
will
the
diary
as
already
explained
comprehends
ten
years
of
pepys
official
life
extending
from
january
to
may
it
is
highly
necessary
to
keep
in
mind
that
pepys
was
only
years
of
age
when
he
closed
his
diary
in
and
that
of
the
remainder
of
his
life
we
have
no
regular
account
although
the
materials
for
it
which
exist
have
encouraged
the
hope
that
this
portion
of
the
life
may
yet
be
written
after
the
death
of
cromwell
pepys
seems
to
have
consorted
much
with
harrington
hazelrigge
and
other
leading
republicans
but
when
the
restoration
took
place
he
became
as
perhaps
was
natural
a
courtier
still
it
is
said
of
him
that
were
the
eulogy
of
cromwell
now
to
be
written
abounding
particulars
and
material
for
the
purpose
might
be
found
in
and
drawn
from
pepys
diary
pepys
sat
in
parliament
for
castle
rising
and
subsequently
he
represented
the
borough
of
harwich
eventually
rising
to
wealth
and
eminence
as
clerk
of
the
treasurer
to
the
commissioners
of
the
affairs
of
tangier
and
of
the
victualling
department
proving
himself
to
be
it
is
stated
a
very
useful
and
energetic
public
servant
in
the
year
pepys
whose
constitution
had
been
long
impaired
by
the
stone
was
persuaded
by
his
physicians
to
quit
york
buildings
now
the
last
house
on
the
west
side
looking
on
the
thames
and
retire
for
change
of
air
to
the
house
of
his
old
friend
and
servant
william
hewer
at
clapham
soon
after
he
was
visited
here
by
john
evelyn
who
in
his
diary
records
i
went
to
visit
pepys
at
clapham
where
he
has
a
very
noble
and
wonderfully
furnished
house
especially
with
india
and
chinese
curiosities
the
offices
and
gardens
well
accommodated
for
pleasure
and
retirement
in
this
retreat
however
his
health
continued
to
decline
and
he
died
in
may
a
victim
in
part
to
the
stone
which
was
hereditary
in
his
constitution
and
to
the
increase
of
that
malady
in
the
course
of
a
laborious
and
sedentary
life
in
the
london
journal
of
the
above
year

interred

contributed
no
less
than
plates
to

he
left
an
invaluable
collection
of
manuscript
naval
memoirs
of
prints
and
ancient
english
poetry
which
has
often
been
consulted
by
critics
and
commentators
and
is
indeed
unrivalled
of
its
kind
one
of
its
most
singular
curiosities

in
five
large
folio
volumes
begun

the
court
of
portugal
in
and
by
which
watt
ascribes
to
pepys
in
the
supplement
to
collier
dictionary
published
contemporaneously
is
this
tribute
to
the
character
of
samuel
pepys
it
may
be
affirmed
of
this
gentleman
that
he
was
without
exception
the
greatest
and
most
useful
minister
that
ever
filled
the
same
situations
in
england
the
acts
and
registers
of
the
admiralty
proving
this
fact
beyond
contradiction
the
principal
rules
and
establishments
in
present
use
in
those
offices
are
well
known
to
have
been
of
his
introducing
and
most
of
the
officers
serving
therein
since
the
restoration
of
his
bringing
up
he
was
a
most
studious
promoter
and
strenuous
assertor
of
order
and
discipline
through
all
their
dependencies
sobriety
diligence
capacity
loyalty
and
subjection
to
command
were
essentials
required
in
all
whom
he
advanced
where
any
of
these
were
found
wanting
no
interest
or
authority
were
capable
of
moving
him
in
favour
of
the
highest
pretender
the
royal
command
only
excepted
of
which
he
was
also
very
watchful
to
prevent
any
undue
procurements
discharging
his
duty
to
his
prince
and
country
with
a
religious
application
and
perfect
integrity
he
feared
no
one
courted
no
one
neglected
his
own
fortune
besides
this
he
was
a
person
of
universal
worth
and
in
great
estimation
among
the
literati
for
his
unbounded
reading
his
sound
judgment
his
great
elocution
his
mastery
in
method
his
singular
curiosity
and
his
uncommon
munificence
towards
the
advancement
of
learning
arts
and
industry
in
all
degrees
to
which
were
joined
the
severest
morality
of
a
philosopher
and
all
the
polite
accomplishments
of
a
gentleman
particularly
those
of
music
languages
conversation
and
address
he
assisted
as
one
of
the
barons
of
the
cinque
ports
at
the
coronation
of
james
and
was
a
standing
governor
of
all
the
principal
houses
of
charity
in
and
about
london
and
sat
at
the
head
of
many
other
honourable
bodies
in
divers
of
which
as
he
deemed
their
constitution
and
methods
deserving
he
left
lasting
monuments
of
his
bounty
and
patronage

a
great
while
in

i
heard
that
lambert
was
coming
up
to
london
that
my
lord
fairfax

in
the
head
of

but
it

upon
finishing
the
act
for
the
council
of
state
which
they
did
and
for
the
indemnity

to

again
thereupon
in
the
afternoon
great
talk
that
many
places
had
declared
for
a

believed
that
they
will
be
forced
to
fill
up
the
house
with
the
old
members
from
the
hall
i
called
at
home

and
there
i
eat
some
bread
and
cheese

passed
the
act
for

for
the
soldiers

officers
that

come
in
in
so
many

that

also
voted
that
all

the
death
of

of
the
old

should
be
filled
up
but
those
that
are
living
shall
not
be
called
in
strange
the
difference
of
men
talk
some
say
that
lambert
must
of
necessity
yield
up
others
that
he
is
very
strong
and
that
the
will
stick
to
him
if
he
declares
for
a
free
parliament
chillington
was
sent
yesterday
to
him
with
the
vote
of

and
walked
in
the
hall
where
i
heard
that
the
parliament

this
day
in
fasting
and
prayer
and
in
the
afternoon
came
letters
from
the
north
that
brought
certain

declare
for
the
parliament
himself
and
that
my
lord
fairfax
did
also
rest
satisfied
and
had
laid
down
his
arms
and
that
what
he
had
done
was
only
to
secure
the
country
against
my
lord
lambert
his
raising
of
money
and
free
quarter
thomas
lord
fairfax
generalissimo
of
the
parliament
forces
after
the
restoration
he
retired
to
his
country
seat
where
he
lived
in
private
till
his
death
in
i
dined
with
shepley
at
my
lord
lodgings
admiral
sir
edward
montagu
afterwards
earl
of
sandwich
uniformly
styled
my
lord
throughout
the
diary
upon
his
turkey
pie
and
so
to
my
office
again
where
the
excise
money
was
brought
and
some
of
it
told
to
soldiers
till
it
was
dark
then
i
went
home
after
writing
to
my
lord
the
news
that
the
parliament
had
this
night
voted
that
the
members
that
were
discharged
from
sitting
in
the
years
and
were
duly
discharged
and
that
there
should
be
writs
issued
presently
for
the
calling
of
others
in
their
places
and
that
monk
and
fairfax
were
commanded
up
to
town
and
that
the
prince
lodgings
were
to
be
provided
for
monk
at
whitehall
fage
and
i
did
discourse
concerning
public
business
and
he
told
me
it
is
true
the
city
had
not
time
enough
to
do
much
but
they
had
resolved
to
shake
off
the
soldiers
and
that
unless
there
be
a
free
parliament
chosen
he
did
believe
there
are
half
the
common
council
will
not
levy
any
money
by
order
of
this
parliament
this
morning
shepley
and
i
did
eat
our
breakfast
at
harper
my
brother
john
being
with
me
upon
a
cold
and
a
goose
i
rose
early
this
morning
and
looked
over
and
corrected
my
brother
john
speech
which
he
is
to
make
the
next
opposition
declamations
at
paul
school
in
which
there
were
opponents
and
respondents
i
met
with
simons
muddiman
and
jack
price
and
went
with
them
to
harper
and
staid
till
two
of
the
clock
in
the
afternoon
i
found
muddiman
a
good
scholar
an
arch
rogue
and
owns
that
though
he
writes
new
books
for
the
parliament
yet
he
did
declare
that
he
did
it
only
to
get
money
and
did
talk
very
basely
of
many
of
them
among
other
things
simons
told
me
how
his
uncle
scobell
scobell
clerk
to
the
house
of
commons
was
on
saturday
last
called
to
the
bar
for
entering
in
the
journal
of
the
house
for
the
year
these
words
this
day
his
excellence
the
lord
cromwell
dissolved
this
house
which
words
the
parliament
voted
a
forgery
and
demanded
of
him
how
they
same
to
be
entered
he
said
that
they
were
his
own
and
that
he
did
it
by
rights
of
his
office
and
the
practice
of
his
predecessor
and
that
the
intent
of
the
practice
was
to
let
posterity
know
how
such
and
such
a
parliament
was
dissolved
whether
by
the
command
of
the
king
or
by
their
own
neglect
as
the
last
house
of
lords
was
and
that
to
this
end
he
had
said
and
writ
that
it
was
dissolved
by
his
excellence
the
lord
and
that
for
the
word
dissolved
he
never
at
the
time
did
hear
of
any
other
term
and
desired
pardon
if
he
would
not
dare
to
make
a
word
himself
what
it
was
six
years
after
before
they
came
themselves
to
call
it
an
interruption
that
they
were
so
little
satisfied
with
this
answer
that
they
did
chuse
a
committee
to
report
to
the
house
whether
this
crime
of
scobell
did
come
within
the
act
of
indemnity
or
no
thence
into
the
hall
where
i
heard
for
certain
that
monk
was
coming
to
london
and
that
bradshaw
lodgings
were
preparing
for
him
john
bradshaw
president
of
the
high
court
of
justice
i
heard
sir
vane
was
this
day
voted
out
of
the
house
and
to
sit
no
more
there
and
that
he
would
retire
himself
to
his
house
at
raby
son
of
a
statesman
of
both
his
names
and
one
of
the
most
turbulent
enthusiasts
produced
by
the
rebellion
and
an
inflexible
republican
his
execution
in
for
conspiring
the
death
of
charles
was
much
called
in
question
as
a
measure
of
great
severity
as
also
all
the
rest
of
the
nine
officers
that
had
their
commissions
formerly
taken
away
from
them
were
commanded
to
their
farthest
houses
from
london
during
the
pleasure
of
the
parliament
to
the
where
were
a
great
confluence
of
gentlemen
viz
harrington
poultny
chairman
gold
dr
petty
where
admirable
discourse
till
at
night
thence
with
doling
to
mother
lam
who
told
me
how
this
day
scott
was
made
intelligencer
and
that
the
rest
of
the
members
that
were
objected
against
last
night
were
to
be
heard
this
day
james
harrington
the
political
writer
author
of
oceana
and
founder
of
a
club
called
the
rota
in
which
met
at
in
old
palace
yard
and
lasted
only
a
few
months
in
he
was
sent
to
the
tower
on
suspicion
of
treasonable
designs
his
intellects
appear
to
have
failed
afterwards
and
he
died
sir
william
poultny
subsequently
for
westminster
and
a
commissioner
of
the
privy
seal
under
king
william
ob
sir
william
petty
an
eminent
physician
and
celebrated
for
his
proficiency
in
every
branch
of
science
ob
thomas
scott
made
secretary
of
state
to
the
commonwealth
following
coming
in
the
morning
to
my
office
i
met
with
fage
and
took
him
to
the
swan
he
told
me
how
he
haselrigge
sir
arthur
haselrigge
bart
of
nosely
leicester
colonel
of
a
regiment
in
the
parliament
army
and
much
esteemed
by
cromwell
ob
and
morley
probably
colonel
morley
lieutenant
of
the
tower
the
last
night
began
at
my
lord
mayor
to
exclaim
against
the
city
of
london
saying
that
they
had
forfeited
their
charter
and
how
the
chamberlain
of
the
city
did
take
them
down
letting
them
know
how
much
they
were
formerly
beholding
to
the
city
he
also
told
me
that
monk
letter
that
came
by
the
was
a
cunning
piece
and
that
which
they
did
not
much
trust
to
but
they
were
resolved
to
make
no
more
applications
to
the
parliament
nor
to
pay
any
money
unless
the
secluded
members
be
brought
in
or
a
free
parliament
chosen
in
the
morning
i
went
up
to
crewe
who
did
talk
to
me
concerning
things
of
state
and
expressed
his
mind
how
just
it
was
that
the
secluded
members
should
come
to
sit
again
from
thence
to
my
office
where
nothing
to
do
but
mr
downing
came
and
found
me
all
alone
and
did
mention
to
me
his
going
back
into
holland
and
did
ask
me
whether
i
would
go
or
no
but
gave
me
little
encouragement
but
bid
me
consider
of
it
and
asked
me
whether
i
did
not
think
that
hawley
could
perform
the
work
of
my
office
alone
i
confess
i
was
at
a
great
loss
all
the
day
after
to
bethink
myself
how
to
carry
this
business
i
staid
up
till
the
came
by
with
his
bell
just
under
my
window
as
i
was
writing
of
this
very
line
and
cried
past
one
of
the
clock
and
a
cold
frosty
windy
morning
in
our
way
to
kensington
we
understood
how
that
my
lord
chesterfield
philip
second
earl
of
chesterfield
born
ob
had
killed
another
gentleman
about
half
an
hour
before
and
was
fled
i
went
to
the
coffee
club
and
heard
very
good
discourse
it
was
in
answer
to
harrington
answer
who
said
that
the
state
of
the
roman
government
was
not
a
settled
government
and
so
it
was
no
wonder
that
the
balance
of
prosperity
was
in
one
hand
and
the
command
in
another
it
being
therefore
always
in
a
posture
of
war
but
it
was
carried
by
ballot
that
it
was
a
steady
government
though
it
is
true
by
the
voices
it
had
been
carried
before
that
it
was
an
unsteady
government
so
it
is
to
be
proved
by
the
opponents
that
the
balance
lay
in
one
hand
and
the
government
in
another
thence
i
went
to
westminster
and
met
shaw
and
washington
who
told
me
how
this
day
sydenham
colonel
sydenham
had
been
an
active
officer
during
the
civil
wars
on
the
parliament
side
for
dorsetshire
and
governor
of
melcombe
and
one
of
the
committee
of
safety
was
voted
out
of
the
house
for
sitting
any
more
this
parliament
and
that
salloway
was
voted
out
likewise
and
sent
to
the
tower
in
the
journals
of
that
date
major
salwey
during
the
pleasure
of
the
house
at
harper
jack
price
told
me
among
other
things
how
much
the
protector
is
altered
though
he
would
seem
to
bear
out
his
trouble
very
well
yet
he
is
scarce
able
to
talk
sense
with
a
man
and
how
he
will
say
that
who
should
a
man
trust
if
he
may
not
trust
to
a
brother
and
an
uncle
and
how
much
those
men
have
to
answer
before
god
almighty
for
their
playing
the
knave
with
him
as
they
did
he
told
me
also
that
there
was
offered
and
would
have
been
taken
for
his
restitution
had
not
the
parliament
come
in
as
they
did
again
and
that
he
do
believe
that
the
protector
will
live
to
give
a
testimony
of
his
valour
and
revenge
yet
before
he
dies
and
that
the
protector
will
say
so
himself
sometimes
all
the
world
is
at
a
loss
to
think
what
monk
will
do
the
city
saying
that
he
will
be
for
them
and
the
parliament
saying
he
will
be
for
them
this
morning
i
was
sent
for
to
mr
downing
and
at
his
bed
side
he
told
me
that
he
had
a
kindness
for
me
and
that
he
thought
that
he
had
done
me
one
and
that
was
that
he
had
got
me
to
be
one
of
the
clerks
of
the
council
at
which
i
was
a
little
stumbled
and
could
not
tell
what
to
do
whether
to
thank
him
or
no
but
by
and
by
i
did
but
not
very
heartily
for
i
feared
that
his
doing
of
it
was
only
to
ease
himself
of
the
salary
which
he
gives
me
moore
and
i
went
to
the
french
ordinary
where
mr
downing
this
day
feasted
sir
arth
haselrigge
and
a
great
many
more
of
the
parliament
and
did
stay
to
put
him
in
mind
of
me
here
he
gave
me
a
note
to
go
and
invite
some
other
members
to
dinner
so
i
went
to
white
hall
and
did
stay
at
marsh
with
simons
luellin
and
all
the
rest
of
the
clerks
of
the
council
who
i
hear
are
all
turned
out
only
the
two
leighs
and
they
do
all
tell
me
that
my
name
was
mentioned
last
night
but
that
nothing
was
done
in
it
in
the
morning
i
met
lord
widdrington
in
the
street
sir
thomas
widdrington
knight
one
of
commissioners
of
the
treasury
appointed
speaker
and
first
commissioner
for
the
great
seal
january
he
was
for
york

to
seal
the

long
or

brought
in
on

satisfy
the
world
what
they
intend
to
do
to
church
in
the
afternoon
to
mr
herring
where
a
lazy
poor
sermon
this
day
i
began
to
put
on
buckles
to
my
shoes
this
day
the
parliament
sat
late
and
revolved
of
the
declaration
to
be
printed

the
people

promising
them
a
great
many
good

with
him
lambert

with
them
the
declaration
that
came
out
from
the
parliament
wherein
they
declare
for
law
and
gospel
and
for
tythes
but
i
do
not
find
people
apt
to
believe
them
this
day
the
parliament
gave
orders
that
the
late
committee
of
safety
should
come
before
them
this
day

all

their
model
of

brought

that
in
cheapside
there

been
but
a

up
and
the

and
sat
in

by
flight
and
died
in
at
amsterdam

called
at
paul
churchyard
where
i
bought
buxtorf
hebrew
grammar
and
read
a
declaration
of
the
gentlemen
of
northampton
which
came
out
this
afternoon
called
for
some
papers
at
whitehall
for
mr
downing

of
which

an
order
of
the
council

be
paid
monthly
and
the
other
two
orders
to
the
commissioners
of
customs
to
let
his
goods

free
home
from
my
office
to
my
lord

where
my
wife

got
ready
a
very
fine
dinner
viz
a
dish
of
marrow
bones
a
leg
of
mutton
a
loin
of
veal
a
dish
of
fowl
three
pullets

great
tart
a
neat

anchovies
a
dish
of
prawns
and
cheese
my
company
was
my
father
my
uncle
fenner
his
two
sons
pierce
and
all
their
wives
and
my
brother
tom
the
news
this
day
is
a
letter
that
speaks
absolutely
monk
concurrence
with
this
parliament
and
nothing
else
which
yet
i
hardly
believe
i
went
to
mr
downing
who
told
me
that
he
was
resolved
to
be
gone
for
holland
this
morning
so
i
to
my
office
again
and
dispatch
my
business
there
and
came
with
hawley
to
mr
downing
lodgings
and
took
squib
from
white
hall
in
a
coach
thither
with
me
and
there
we
waited
in
his
chamber
a
great
while
till
he
came
in
and
in
the
mean
time
sent
all
his
things
to
the
barge
that
lays
at
stairs
then
came
he
in
and
took
a
very
civil
leave
of
me
beyond
my
expectations
for
i
was
afraid
that
he
would
have
told
me
something
of
removing
me
from
my
office
but
he
did
not
but
that
he
would
do
me
any
service
that
lay
in
his
power
so
i
went
down
and
sent
a
porter
to
my
house
for
my
best
fur
cap
but
he
coming
too
late
with
it
i
did
not
present
it
to
him
and
so
i
returned
and
went
to
heaven
a
place
of
entertainment
in
old
palace
yard
on
the
site
of
which
the
of
the
house
of
commons
now
stand
it
is
called
in
hudibras
false
heaven
at
the
end
of
the
hall
where
luellin
and
i
dined
in
the
morning
i
went
to
gunning
where
he
made
an
excellent
sermon
upon
the
of
the
galatians
about
the
difference
that
fell
between
paul
and
peter
whereby
he
did
prove
that
contrary
to
the
doctrine
of
the
roman
church
paul
did
never
own
any
dependance
or
that
he
was
inferior
to
st
peter
but
that
they
were
equal
only
one
a
particular
charge
of
preaching
to
the
jews
and
the
other
to
the
gentiles
this
morning
before
i
was
up
i
fell
of
my
song
great
good
and
just
and
put
myself
thereby
in
mind
that
this
was
the
fatal
day
now
ten
years
since
his
majesty
died
this
is
the
beginning
of
montrose
verses
on
the
execution
of
charles
the
first
which
pepys
had
probably
set
to
music
great
good
and
just
could
i
but
rate
my
grief
and
thy
too
rigid
fate
i
weep
the
world
to
such
a
strain
that
it
should
deluge
once
again
but
since
thy
blood
demands
supplies
more
from
briareus
hands
than
argus
eyes
i
sing
thy
obsequies
with
trumpet
sounds
and
write
thy
epitaph
with
blood
and
wounds
there
seems
now
to
be
a
general
cease
of
talk
it
being
taken
for
granted
that
monk
do
resolve
to
stand
to
the
parliament
and
nothing
else
after
dinner
to
westminster
hall
where
all
we
clerks
had
orders
to
wait
upon
the
committee
at
the
that
is
to
try
colonel
jones
and
to
give
an
account
what
money
we
had
paid
him
but
the
committee
did
not
sit
colonel
john
jones
impeached
with
general
ludlow
and
miles
corbet
for
treasonable
practices
in
ireland
called
in
at
harper
with
pulford
servant
to
waterhouse
who
tells
me
that
whereas
my
lord
fleetwood
should
have
answered
to
the
parliament
he
wrote
a
letter
and
desired
a
little
more
time
he
being
a
great
way
out
of
town
charles
fleetwood
lord
deputy
of
ireland
during
the
usurpation
became
cromwell
by
his
marriage
with
ireton
widow
and
a
member
of
the
council
of
state
he
seems
disposed
to
have
espoused
charles
the
second
interests
but
had
not
resolution
enough
to
execute
his
design
at
the
restoration
he
was
excepted
out
of
the
act
of
indemnity
and
spent
the
remainder
of
his
life
in
obscurity
dying
soon
after
the
revolution
and
how
that
he
is
quite
ashamed
of
himself
and
confesses
how
he
had
deserved
this
for
his
baseness
to
his
brother
and
that
he
is
like
to
pay
part
of
the
money
paid
out
of
the
exchequer
during
the
committee
of
safety
out
of
his
own
purse
again
which
i
am
glad
on
i
could
find
nothing
in
mr
downing
letter
which
hawley
brought
me
concerning
my
office
but
i
could
discern
that
hawley
had
a
mind
that
i
would
get
to
be
clerk
of
the
council
i
suppose
that
he
might
have
the
greater
salary
but
i
think
it
not
safe
yet
to
change
this
for
a
public
employment
february
took
gammer
east
and
james
the
porter
a
soldier
to
my
lord
lodgings
who
told
me
how
they
were
drawn
into
the
field
and
that
they
were
ordered
to
march
away
to
make
room
for
general
monk
but
they
did
shout
their
colonel
fitch
thomas
fitch
colonel
of
a
regiment
of
foot
in
for
inverness
and
the
rest
of
the
officers
out
of
the
field
and
swore
they
would
not
go
without
their
money
and
if
they
would
not
give
it
them
they
would
go
where
they
might
have
it
and
that
was
the
city
so
the
colonel
went
to
the
parliament
and
commanded
what
money
could
be
got
to
be
got
against
for
them
and
all
the
rest
of
the
soldiers
in
town
who
in
all
places
made
a
mutiny
this
day
and
do
agree
together
to
my
office
where
i
found
all
the
officers
of
the
regiments
in
town
waiting
to
receive
money
that
their
soldiers
might
go
out
of
town
and
what
was
in
the
exchequer
they
had
harper
luellin
and
i
went
to
the
temple
to
chamber
and
from
thence
had
his
man
by
water
to
london
bridge
to
calthrop
a
grocer
and
received
for
my
lord
in
our
way
we
talked
with
our
waterman
white
who
told
us
how
the
watermen
had
lately
been
abused
by
some
that
had
a
desire
to
get
in
to
be
watermen
to
the
state
and
had
lately
presented
an
address
of
nine
or
ten
thousand
hands
to
stand
by
this
parliament
when
it
was
only
told
them
that
it
was
a
petition
against
hackney
coaches
and
that
they
had
put
out
another
to
undeceive
the
world
and
to
clear
themselves
after
i
had
received
the
money
we
went
homewards
but
over
against
somerset
house
hearing
the
noise
of
guns
we
landed
and
found
the
strand
full
of
soldiers
so
i
took
my
money
and
went
to
johnson
my
sempstress
and
giving
her
my
money
to
lay
up
doling
and
i
went
up
stairs
to
a
window
and
looked
out
and
saw
the
foot
face
the
horse
and
beat
them
back
and
stood
bawling
and
calling
in
the
street
for
a
free
parliament
and
money
by
and
by
a
drum
was
heard
to
beat
a
march
coming
towards
them
and
they
got
all
ready
again
and
faced
them
and
they
proved
to
be
of
the
same
mind
with
them
and
so
they
made
a
great
deal
of
joy
to
see
one
another
after
all
this
i
went
home
on
foot
to
lay
up
my
money
and
change
my
stockings
and
shoes
i
this
day
left
off
my
great
skirt
suit
and
put
on
my
white
suit
with
silver
lace
coat
and
went
over
to
harper
where
i
met
with
simons
doling
luellin
and
three
merchants
one
of
which
had
occasion
to
use
a
porter
so
they
sent
for
one
and
james
the
soldier
came
who
told
us
how
they
had
been
all
day
and
night
upon
their
guard
at
james
and
that
through
the
whole
town
they
did
resolve
to
stand
to
what
they
had
began
and
that
he
did
believe
they
would
go
into
the
city
and
be
received
there
after
this
we
went
to
a
sport
called
selling
of
a
horse
for
a
dish
of
eggs
and
herrings
and
sat
talking
there
till
almost
twelve
at
night
drank
my
morning
draft
at
harper
and
was
told
there
that
the
soldiers
were
all
quiet
upon
promise
of
pay
thence
to
james
park
back
to
whitehall
where
in
a
i
saw
about
thirty
or
forty
of
the
city
who
were
taken
at
twelve
last
night
and
brought
prisoners
hither
thence
to
my
office
where
i
paid
a
little
more
money
to
some
of
the
soldiers
under
miller
who
held
out
the
tower
against
the
parliament
after
it
was
taken
away
from
fitch
by
the
committee
of
safety
and
yet
he
continued
in
his
office
about
noon
turner
came
to
speak
with
me
and
joyce
and
i
took
them
and
shewed
them
the
manner
of
the
houses
sitting
the
very
civilly
opening
the
door
for
us
we
went
walking
all
over
white
hall
whither
general
monk
was
newly
come
and
we
saw
all
his
forces
march
by
in
very
good
plight
and
stout
officers
after
dinner
i
went
to
hear
news
but
only
found
that
the
parliament
house
was
most
of
them
with
monk
at
white
hall
and
that
in
his
passing
through
the
town
he
had
many
calls
to
him
for
a
free
parliament
but
little
other
welcome
i
saw
in
the
palace
yard
how
unwilling
some
of
the
old
soldiers
were
yet
to
go
out
of
town
without
their
money
and
swore
if
they
had
it
not
in
three
days
as
they
were
promised
they
would
do
them
more
mischief
in
the
country
than
if
they
had
staid
here
and
that
is
very
likely
the
country
being
all
discontented
the
town
and
guards
are
already
full
of
monk
soldiers
all
the
news
is
that
the
parliament
this
morning
voted
the
house
to
be
made
up
four
hundred
forthwith
to
westminster
where
we
found
the
soldiers
all
set
in
the
palace
yard
to
make
way
for
general
monk
to
come
to
the
house
i
stood
upon
the
steps
and
saw
monk
go
by
he
making
observance
to
the
judges
as
he
went
along
to
the
hall
where
in
the
palace
i
saw
monk
soldiers
abuse
billing
and
all
the
quakers
that
were
at
a
there
and
indeed
the
soldiers
did
use
them
very
roughly
and
were
to
blame
this
day
mr
crew
told
me
that
my
lord
john
is
for
a
free
parliament
and
that
he
is
very
great
with
monk
who
hath
now
the
absolute
command
and
power
to
do
any
thing
that
he
hath
a
mind
to
do
before
i
was
out
of
my
bed
i
heard
the
soldiers
very
busy
in
the
morning
getting
their
horses
ready
when
they
lay
at
hilton
but
i
knew
not
then
their
meaning
in
so
doing
in
the
hall
i
understand
how
monk
is
this
morning
gone
into
london
with
his
army
and
fage
told
me
that
he
do
believe
that
monk
is
gone
to
secure
some
of
the
of
the
city
who
were
very
high
yesterday
there
and
did
vote
that
they
would
not
pay
any
taxes
till
the
house
was
filled
up
i
went
to
my
office
where
i
wrote
to
my
lord
after
i
had
been
at
the
upper
bench
where
sir
robert
pye
this
morning
came
to
desire
his
discharge
from
the
tower
but
it
could
not
be
granted
i
called
at
harper
who
told
me
how
monk
had
this
day
clapt
up
many
of
the
and
that
the
parliament
had
voted
that
he
should
pull
down
their
gates
and
portcullisses
their
posts
and
their
chains
which
he
do
intend
to
do
and
do
lie
in
the
city
all
night
to
westminster
hall
where
i
heard
an
action
very
finely
pleaded
between
my
lord
dorset
richard
earl
of
dorset
ob
and
some
other
noble
persons
his
lady
and
other
ladies
of
quality
being
there
and
it
was
about
per
annum
that
was
to
be
paid
to
a
poor
spittal
which
was
given
by
some
of
his
predecessors
and
given
on
his
side
fage
told
me
what
monk
had
done
in
the
city
how
he
had
pulled
down
the
most
part
of
the
gates
and
chains
that
they
could
break
down
and
that
he
was
now
gone
back
to
white
hall
the
city
look
mighty
blank
and
can
not
tell
what
in
the
world
to
do
the
parliament
having
this
day
ordered
that
the
council
sit
no
more
but
that
new
ones
be
chosen
according
to
what
qualifications
they
shall
give
them
i
heard
the
news
of
a
letter
from
monk
who
was
now
gone
into
the
city
again
and
did
resolve
to
stand
for
the
sudden
filling
up
of
the
house
and
it
was
very
strange
how
the
countenance
of
men
in
the
hall
was
all
changed
with
joy
in
half
an
hour
time
so
i
went
up
to
the
lobby
where
i
saw
the
speaker
reading
of
the
letter
and
after
it
was
read
sir
haselrigge
came
out
very
angry
and
billing
standing
at
the
door
took
him
by
the
arm
and
cried
thou
man
will
thy
beast
carry
thee
no
longer
thou
must
fall
we
took
coach
for
the
city
to
guildhall
where
the
hall
was
full
of
people
expecting
monk
and
lord
mayor
to
come
thither
and
all
very
joyfull
met
monk
coming
out
of
the
chamber
where
he
had
been
with
the
mayor
and
aldermen
but
such
a
shout
i
never
heard
in
all
my
life
crying
out
god
bless
your
excellence
here
i
met
with
mr
lock
and
took
him
to
an
when
we
were
come
together
he
told
us
the
substance
of
the
letter
that
went
from
monk
to
the
parliament
wherein
after
complaints
that
he
and
his
officers
were
put
upon
such
offices
against
the
city
as
they
could
not
do
with
any
content
or
honour
it
states
that
there
are
many
members
now
in
the
house
that
were
of
the
late
tyrannical
committee
of
safety
that
lambert
and
vane
are
now
in
town
contrary
to
the
vote
of
parliament
that
many
in
the
house
do
press
for
new
oaths
to
be
put
upon
men
whereas
we
have
more
cause
to
be
sorry
for
the
many
oaths
that
we
have
already
taken
and
broken
that
the
late
petition
of
the
fanatique
people
prevented
by
barebone
for
the
imposing
of
an
oath
upon
all
sorts
of
people
was
received
by
the
house
with
thanks
that
therefore
he
monk
did
desire
that
all
writs
for
filling
up
of
the
house
be
issued
by
friday
next
and
that
in
the
mean
time
he
would
retire
into
the
city
and
only
leave
them
guards
for
the
security
of
the
house
and
council
the
occasion
of
this
was
the
order
that
he
had
last
night
to
go
into
the
city
and
disarm
them
and
take
away
their
charter
whereby
he
and
his
officers
said
that
the
house
had
a
mind
to
put
them
upon
things
that
should
make
them
odious
and
so
it
would
be
in
their
power
to
do
what
they
would
with
them
we
were
told
that
the
parliament
had
sent
scott
and
robinson
to
monk
this
afternoon
but
he
would
not
hear
them
and
that
the
mayor
and
aldermen
had
offered
their
own
houses
for
himself
and
his
officers
and
that
his
soldiers
would
lack
for
nothing
and
indeed
i
saw
many
people
give
the
soldiers
drink
and
money
and
all
along
the
streets
cried
god
bless
them
and
extraordinary
good
words
hence
we
went
to
a
house
hard
by
where
i
saw
sir
nich
crisp
an
eminent
merchant
and
one
of
the
farmers
of
the
customs
he
had
advanced
large
sums
to
assist
charles
who
created
him
a
baronet
he
died
aged
and
so
we
went
to
the
star
tavern
monk
being
then
at
benson
in
cheapside
there
was
a
great
many
bonfires
and
bow
bells
and
all
the
bells
in
all
the
churches
as
we
went
home
were
hence
we
went
homewards
it
being
about
ten
at
night
but
the
common
joy
that
was
every
where
to
be
seen
the
number
of
bonfires
there
being
fourteen
between
dunstan
and
temple
bar
and
at
strand
bridge
i
could
at
one
time
tell
fires
in
seven
or
eight
and
all
along
burning
and
roasting
and
drinking
for
rumps
there
being
rumps
tied
upon
sticks
and
carried
up
and
down
the
butchers
at
the
may
pole
in
the
strand
rang
a
peal
with
their
knives
when
they
were
going
to
sacrifice
their
rump
on
ludgate
hill
there
was
one
turning
of
the
spit
that
had
a
rump
tied
upon
it
and
another
basting
of
it
indeed
it
was
past
imagination
both
the
greatness
and
the
suddenness
of
it
at
one
end
of
the
street
you
would
think
there
was
a
whole
lane
on
fire
and
so
hot
that
we
were
fain
to
keep
on
the
further
side
in
the
morning
it
being
lord
day
to
white
hall
where
hones
preached
but
i
staid
not
to
hear
but
walking
in
the
court
i
heard
that
sir
arth
haselrigge
was
newly
gone
into
the
city
to
monk
and
that
monk
wife
removed
from
white
hall
last
night
after
dinner
i
heard
that
monk

been
at
paul
in
the
morning
and
the
people
had
shouted
much
at
his
coming
out
of
the
church
in
the
afternoon
he
was
at
a
church
in
whereabout
he
do
lodge
to
my
father
where
charles
glascocke
was
overjoyed
to
see
how

told
me

night
broke

by
his
name
about
this
period

had
appeared
at
the
head
of
a
band
of
fanatics
and
alarmed

who
well
knew
his
influence
this
day
monk
was
invited
to
white
hall
to
dinner
by
my
lords
not
seeming
willing
he
would
not
come

went
to
fage
from
my

been
this
afternoon
with
monk
who
did
promise
to
live
and
die
with
the
city
and
for
the
honour
of
the
city
and
indeed
the
city
is
very
to
the
soldiers
that
they
are
most
of
them
drunk
all
day
and
had
money
given
them
to
westminster
hall
there
being
many
new
remonstrances
and
declarations
from
many
counties
to
monk
and
the
city
and
one
coming
from
the
north
from
sir
thomas
fairfax
thomas

mentioned
before
i
heard
that
the
parliament

now
changed
the
oath
so
much
talked
of
to
a
promise
and
that
among
other
qualifications
for
the
members
that
are
to
be
chosen
one
is
that

man
nor
the
son
of
any
man

do
about
the
issuing
of
the
writs
for
the
filling
up
of
the
house
according
to
monk
desire
to
westminster
hall
where
i
heard
that
some
of
the
members
of
the
house
was
gone
to
meet
with
some
of
the
secluded
members
and
general
monk
in
the
city
hence
to
white
hall
thinking
to
hear
more
news
where
i
met
with
hunt
who
told
me
how
monk
had
sent
for
all
his
goods
that
he
had
here
into
the
city
and
yet
again
he
told
me
that
some
of
the
members
of
the
house
had
this
day
laid
in
firing
into
their
lodgings
at
whitehall
for
a
good
while
so
that
we
are
at
a
great
stand
to
think
what
will
become
of
things
whether
monk
will
stand
to
the
parliament
or
no
this
day
two
soldiers
were
hanged
in
the
strand
for
their
late
mutiny
at
lord
day
to
gunning
and
heard
an
excellent
sermon
here
i
met
with
moore
and
went
home
with
him
to
dinner
where
he
told
me
the
discourse
that
happened
between
the
secluded
members
and
the
members
of
the
house
before
monk
last
friday
how
the
secluded
said
that
they
did
not
intend
by
coming
in
to
express
revenge
upon
these
men
but
only
to
meet
and
dissolve
themselves
and
only
to
issue
writs
for
a
free
parliament
he
told
me
how
hasselrigge
was
afraid
to
have
the
candle
carried
before
him
for
fear
that
the
people
seeing
him
would
do
him
hurt
and
that
he
was
afraid
to
appear
in
the
city
that
there
is
great
likelihood
that
the
secluded
members
will
come
in
and
so
crewe
and
my
lord
are
likely
to
be
great
men
at
which
i
was
very
glad
after
dinner
there
was
many
secluded
members
come
in
to
crewe
which
it
being
the
lord
day
did
make
moore
believe
that
there
was
something
extraordinary
in
the
business
i
went
forth
to
westminster
hall
where
i
met
with
chetwind
simons
and
gregory
gregory
was
in
clerk
of
the
cheque
at
chatham
they
told
me
how
the
speaker
lenthall
do
refuse
to
sign
the
writs
for
choice
of
new
members
in
the
place
of
the
excluded
and
by
that
means
the
writs
could
not
go
out
in
the
evening
simons
and
i
to
the
coffee
house
where
i
heard
harrington
and
my
lord
of
dorset
and
another
lord
talking
of
getting
another
place
at
the
cockpit
and
they
did
believe
it
would
come
to
something
in
the
morning
i
saw
many
soldiers
going
towards
westminster
hall
to
admit
the
secluded
members
again
so
i
to
westminster
hall
and
in
chancery
i
saw
about
twenty
of
them
who
had
been
at
white
hall
with
general
monk
who
came
thither
this
morning
and
made
a
speech
to
them
and
recommended
to
them
a
commonwealth
and
against
charles
stuart
they
came
to
the
house
and
went
in
one
after
another
and
at
last
the
speaker
came
but
it
is
very
strange
that
this
could
be
carried
so
private
that
the
other
members
of
the
house
heard
nothing
of
all
this
till
they
found
them
in
the
house
insomuch
that
the
soldiers
that
stood
there
to
let
in
the
secluded
members
they
took
for
such
as
they
had
ordered
to
stand
there
to
hinder
their
coming
in
prin
came
with
an
old
sword
on
and
a
great
many
shouts
upon
his
going
into
the
hall
william
prynne
the
lawyer
well
known
by
his
voluminous
publications
and
the
persecution
which
he
endured
he
was
for
bath
and
died
they
sat
till
noon
and
at
their
coming
out
crewe
saw
me
and
bid
me
come
to
his
house
and
dine
with
him
which
i
did
and
he
very
joyful
told
me
that
the
house
had
made
general
monk
general
of
all
the
forces
in
england
scotland
and
ireland
and
that
upon
monk
desire
for
the
service
that
lawson
had
lately
done
in
pulling
down
the
committee
of
safety
he
had
the
command
of
the
sea
for
the
time
being
he
advised
me
to
send
for
my
lord
forthwith
and
told
me
that
there
is
no
question
that
if
he
will
he
may
now
be
employed
again
and
that
the
house
do
intend
to
do
nothing
more
than
to
issue
writs
and
to
settle
a
foundation
for
a
free
parliament
after
dinner
i
back
to
westminster
hall
with
him
in
his
coach
here
i
met
with
mr
lock
and
pursell
master
of
musique
matthew
locke
and
henry
purcell
both
celebrated
composers
and
went
with
them
to
the
coffee
house
into
a
room
next
the
water
by
ourselves
where
we
spent
an
hour
or
two
till
captain

and
told
us
that
the

had
voted
the
gates
of
the
city

into
the
house
sir
george

of
dunham
massey
created

for
his
services
in
behalf
of
the

here
we
had
variety
of
brave
italian
and
spanish
songs
and
a
canon
for
eight
voices
which
mr
lock
had
lately
made
on
these
words
domine
salvum
fac
regem
here
out
of
the
window
it
was
a
most
pleasant
sight
to
see
the
city
from
one
end
to
the
other
with
a
glory
about
it
so
high
was
the
light
of
the
bonfires
and
so
thick
round
the
city
and
the
bells
rang
every
where
walking
in
the
hall
i
saw
major

now
with
his
beard
overgrown

comes
abroad
and
sat
in
the
house
to
white

where
i
met
with
will

and
mabbot
at
marsh

told
me
how
the

this
day
voted
that
the
gates
of

be
set
up
at
the
cost

handsome

suppose
upon

could
find
that
there
was
nothing
at
all
left
of
the
old
preciseness
in
their
discourse
specially
on
saturday
nights
and
zanchy
told
me
that
there
was
no

i
was
a
little
put
to
a
stand
up
by

blayton
and
i
took
horse
and
straight
to
saffron
walden
where
at
the
white
hart
we
set
up
our
horses
and
took
the
master
of
the
house
to
shew
us
audly
end
house
who
took
us
on
foot
through
the
park
and
so
to
the
house
where
the
housekeeper
shewed
us
all
the
house
in
which
the
stateliness
of
the
ceilings
and
form
of
the
whole
was
exceedingly
worth
seeing
he
took
us
into
the
cellar
where
we
drank
most
admirable
drink
a
health
to
the
king
here
i
played
on
my
flageolette
there
being
an
excellent
echo
he
shewed
us
excellent
pictures
two
especially
those
of
the
four
evangelists
and
henry
viii
in
our
going
my
landlord
carried
us
through
a
very
old
hospital
or
almshouse
where
forty
poor
people
was
maintained
a
very
old
foundation
and
over
the
was
an
inscription
in
brass
orate
pro
anima
thomae
bird
the
inscription
and
the
bowl
are
still
to
be
seen
in
the
almshouse
they
brought
me
a
draft
of
their
drink
in
a
brown
bowl
tipt
with
silver
which
i
drank
off
and
at
the
bottom
was
a
picture
of
the
virgin
with
the
child
in
her
arms
done
in
silver
so
we
took
leave
the
road
pretty
good
but
the
weather
rainy
to
eping
up
in
the
morning
then
to
london
through
the
forest
here
we
found
the
way
good
but
only
in
one
path
which
we
kept
as
if
we
had
rode
through
a
kennel
all
the
way
we
found
the
shops
all
shut
and
the
militia
of
the
red
regiment
in
arms
at
the
old
exchange
among
whom
i
found
and
spoke
to
nich
osborne
who
told
me
that
it
was
a
through
the
city
for
the
return
of
the
parliament
at
paul
i
light
blayton
holding
my
horse
where
i
found
reynolds
in
the
pulpit
and
general
monk
there
who
was
to
have
a
great
entertainment
at
grocers
hall
to
my
office
moore
told
me
how
my
lord
is
chosen
general
at
sea
by
the
council
and
that
it
is
thought
that
monk
will
be
joined
with
him
therein
this
day
my
lord
came
to
the
house
the
first
time
since
he

was
newly

thought
that

any
great
matter
against
them

if
he
had
a
mind
i
understand

me
as
i
hear
from

and
get
a
fire
against
an
hour
after
which
we
did
at
white
hall
whither
he
came
and
after
talking
with
him
about
our
going
to

he
called
me
by
myself
into
the
garden
where
he
asked
me
how
things
were
with
me
he
bid
me
look
out
now
at
this
turn
some
good
place
and
he
would
use
all
his
own
and
all
the
interest
of
his
friends
that
he
had
in
england
to
do
me
good
and
asked
me
whether
i
could
without
too
much
inconvenience
go
to
sea
as
his
secretary
and
bid
me
think
of
it
he
also
began
to
talk
of
things
of
state
and
told
me
that
he
should
want
one
in
that
capacity
at
sea
that
he
might
trust
in
and
therefore
he
would
have
me
to
go
he
told
me
also
that
he
did
believe
the
king
would
come
in
and
did
discourse
with
me
about
it
and
about
the
affection
of
the
people
and
city
at
which
i
was
full
glad
wrote
by
the
post
by
my
lord
command
for

in
town
and
i
see
in
the

thought
do
nothing
and
lawson
it
is
said
is
gone
with
some
ships
thither
but
all
that
is
nothing
my
lord
told
me
that
there
was
great
endeavours
to
bring
in
the
protector
again
but
he
told
me
too
that
he
did
believe
it
would
not
last
long
if
he
were
brought
in
no
nor
the
king
neither
though
he
seems
to
think
that
he
will
come
in
unless
he
carry
himself
very
soberly
and
well
every
body
now
drink
the
king
health
without
any
fear
whereas
before
it
was
very
private
that
a
man
dare
do
it
monk
this
day
is
feasted
at
mercers
hall
and
is
invited
one
after
another
to
all
the
twelve
halls
in
london
many
think
that
he
is
honest
yet
and
some
or
more
think
him
to
be
a
fool
that
would
raise
himself
but
think
that
he
will
undo
himself
by
endeavouring
it
ash
wednesday
going
homeward
my
lord
overtook
me
in
his
coach
and
called
me
in
and
so
i
went
with
him
to
james
and
montagu
george
montagu
afterwards
for
dover
second
son
of
edward
second
earl
of
manchester
and
father
of
the
first
earl
of
halifax
being
gone
to
white
hall
we
walked
over
the
park
thither
all
the
way
he
discoursing
of
the
times
and
of
the
change
of
things
since
the
last
year
and
wondering
how
he
could
bear
with
so
great
disappointment
as
he
did
he
did
give
me
the
best
advice
that
he
could
what
was
best
for
me
whether
to
stay
or
go
with
him
and
offered
all
the
ways
that
could
be
how
he
might
do
me
good
with
the
greatest
liberty
and
love
this
day
according
to
order
sir
arthur
haselrigge
appeared
at
the
house
what
was
done
i
know
not
but
there
was
all
the
rumpers
almost
come
to
the
house
my
lord
did
seem
to
wonder
much
why
lambert
was
so
willing
to
be
put
into
the
tower
and
thinks
he
had
some
design
in
it
but
i
think
that
he
is
so
poor
that
he
can
not
use
his
liberty
for
debts
if
he
were
at
liberty
and
so
it
is
as
good
and
better
for
him
to
be
there
than
any
where
else
to
westminster
hall
where
there
was
a
general
damp
over
men
minds
and
faces
upon
some
of
the
officers
of
the
army
being
about
making
a
remonstrance
upon
charles
stuart
or
any
single
person
but
at
noon
it
was
told
that
the
general
had
put
a
stop
to
it
so
all
was
well
again
here
i
met
with
jasper
who
was
to
bring
me
to
my
lord
at
the
lobby
whither
sending
a
note
to
my
lord
he
comes
out
to
me
and
gives
me
directions
to
look
after
getting
some
money
for
him
from
the
admiralty
seeing
that
things
are
so
unsafe
that
he
would
not
lay
out
a
farthing
for
the
state
till
he
had
received
some
money
of
theirs
this
afternoon
some
of
the
officers
of
the
army
and
some
of
the
parliament
had
a
conference
at
white
hall
to
make
all
right
again
but
i
know
not
what
is
done
at
the
dog
tavern
in
comes
wade
and
sterry
secretary
to
the
plenipotentiary
in
denmark
who
brought
the
news
of
the
death
of
the
king
of
sweden
charles
gustavus
at
gottenburgh
the
of
last
month
to
my
lord
at
his
lodging
and
came
to
westminster
with
him
in
the
coach
and
dudley
and
he
in
the
painted
chamber
walked
a
good
while
and
i
telling
him
that
i
was
willing
and
ready
to
go
with
him
to
sea
he
agreed
that
i
should
and
advised
me
what
to
write
to
mr
downing
about
it
this
day
it
was
resolved
that
the
writs
do
go
out
in
the
name
of
the
keepers
of
the
liberty
and
i
hear
that
it
is
resolved
privately
that
a
treaty
be
offered
with
the
king
and
that
monk
did
check
his
soldiers
highly
for
what
they
did
yesterday
at
my
lord
lodgings
who
told
me
that
i
was
to
be
secretary
and
crewe
deputy
treasurer
to
the
fleet
this
day
the
parliament
voted
all
that
had
been
done
by
the
former
rump
against
the
house
of
lords
be
void
and
that
the
writs
go
out
without
any
qualification
things
seem
very
doubtful
what
will
be
the
end
of
all
for
the
parliament
seems
to
be
strong
for
the
king
while
the
soldiers
do
all
talk
against
to
my
lord
where
infinity
of
applications
to
him
and
to
me
to
my
great
trouble
my
lord
gives
me
all
the
papers
that
was
given
to
him
to
put
in
order
and
to
give
him
an
account
of
them
i
went
hence
to
james
to
speake
with
clerke
monk
secretary
about
getting
some
soldiers
removed
out
of
huntingdon
to
oundle
which
my
lord
told
me
he
did
to
do
a
courtesy
to
the
town
that
he
might
have
the
greater
interest
in
them
in
the
choice
of
the
next
parliament
not
that
he
intends
to
be
chosen
himself
but
that
he
might
have
montagu
and
my
lord
mandevill
chose
there
in
spite
of
the
bernards
i
did
promise
to
give
my
wife
all
that
i
have
in
the
world
but
my
books
in
case
i
should
die
at
sea
after
supper
i
went
to
westminster
hall
and
the
parliament
sat
till
ten
at
night
thinking
and
being
expected
to
dissolve
themselves
but
they
did
not
great
talk
that
the
discontented
officers
did
think
this
night
to
make
a
stir
but
prevented
to
westminster
hall
where
i
heard
how
the
parliament
had
this
day
dissolved
themselves
and
did
pass
very
cheerfully
through
the
hall
and
the
speaker
without
his
mace
the
whole
hall
was
joyfull
thereat
as
well
as
themselves
and
now
they
begin
to
talk
loud
of
the
king
i
am
told
that
yesterday
about
five
in
the
afternoon
one
came
with
a
ladder
to
the
great
exchange
and
wiped
with
a
brush
the
inscription
that
was
on
king
charles
and
that
there
was
a
great
bonfire
made
in
the
exchange
and
people
called
out
god
bless
king
charles
the
second
early
to
my
lord
where
infinity
of
business
to
do
which
makes
my
head
full
and
indeed
for
these
two
or
three
days
i
have
not
been
without
a
great
many
cares
after
that
to
the
admiralty
where
a
good
while
with
blackburne
who
told
me
that
it
was
much
to
be
feared
that
the
king
would
come
in
for
all
good
men
and
good
things
were
now
discouraged
thence
to
wilkinson
where
shepley
and
i
dined
and
while
we
were
at
dinner
my
lord
monk
come
by
with
the
serjeant
at
armes
before
them
with
two
proclamations
that
all
cavaliers
do
depart
the
town
but
the
other
that
all
officers
that
were
lately
disbanded
should
do
the
same
the
last
of
which
creed
i
remember
said
that
he
looked
upon
it
as
if
they
had
said
that
all
god
people
should
depart
the
town
all
the
discourse
is
that
the
king
will
come
again
and
for
all
i
see
it
is
the
wishes
of
all
and
all
do
believe
that
it
will
be
so
to
my
lord
but
the
wind
very
high
against
us
here
i
did
very
much
business
and
then
to
my
lord
widdrington
from
my
lord
with
his
desire
that
he
might
have
the
disposal
of
the
writs
of
the
cinque
ports
my
lord
was
very
civil
to
me
and
called
for
wine
and
writ
a
long
letter
in
answer
to
westminster
and
received
my
warrant
of
blackburne
to
be
secretary
to
the
two
generals
of
the
fleet
my
lord
captain
isham
thomas
john
crewe
howe
and
i
to
the
tower
where
the
barges
staid
for
us
my
lord
and
the
captain
in
one
and
howe
and
i
in
the
other
to
the
long
beach
where
the
swiftsure
lay
at
anchor
in
our
way
we
saw
the
great
breach
which
the
late
high
water
had
made
to
the
loss
of
many
to
the
people
about
limehouse
soon
as
my
lord
on
board
the
guns
went
off
bravely
from
the
ships
and
a
little
while
after
comes
the
lawson
and
seemed
very
respectful
to
my
lord
and
so
did
the
rest
of
the
commanders
of
the
frigates
that
were
thereabouts
we
were
late
writing
of
orders
for
the
getting
of
ships
ready
and
also
making
of
others
to
all
the
between
hastings
and
yarmouth
to
stop
all
dangerous
persons
that
are
going
or
coming
between
flanders
and
there
at
work
hard

the
day

to
the
council

the
morning

from
london
by
our
coxon
so
they
waked
me
but
i
bid
him

which
he
did
and
then
i
rose
and
carried
them
into
my
lord

read
them
among
the
rest
there
was
the
writ
and
mandate
for
him
to
dispose
to
the
cinque
ports
for
choice
of
men
there
was
also
one
for
me
from
blackburne
who
with
his
own
hand
superscribes
it
to
p
of
which
god
knows
i
was
not
a
little
proud
i
wrote
a
letter
to
the
clerk
of
dover
castle
to
come
to
my
lord
about
issuing
of
those
writs
this
day
it
is
two
years
since
it
pleased
god
that
i
was
cut
for
the
stone
at
turner
in
salisbury
court
turner
was
the
sister
of
edward
pepys
and
did
resolve
while
i
live
to
keep
it
a
festival
as
i
did
the
last
year
at
my
house
and
for
ever
to
have
turner
and
her
company
with
me
but
now
it
pleased
god
that
i
am
prevented
to
do
it
openly
only
within
my
soul
i
can
and
do
rejoice
and
bless
god
being
at
this
time
blessed
be
his
holy
name
in
as
good
health
as
ever
i
was
in
my
life
this
morning
i
rose
early
and
went
about
making
of
an
establishment
of
the
whole
fleet
and
a
list
of
all
the
ships
with
the
number
of
men
and
guns
about
an
hour
after
that
we
had
a
meeting
of
the
principal
commanders
and
seamen
to
proportion
out
the
number
of
these
things
all
the
afternoon
very
many
orders
were
made
till
i
was
very
weary
this
morning
the
wind
came
about
and
we
fell
into
the
hope
i
sat
the
first
time
with
my
lord
at
table
since
my
coming
to
sea
all
the
afternoon
exceeding
busy
in
writing

i
was
hard

and
the
whole

busy
at

a
gentleman
very
well
bred
his

going
for
flushing
who
spoke
french
and
latin
very
well
brought
by
direction
from

he
confessed
himself
a
cavalier
in
his
heart
and
that
he
and
his

family
had
fought
for
the
king
but
that
he
was
then
drunk
having
been
taking
his
leave
at
gravesend
the
night
before
and
so
could
not
remember
what
it
was
that
he
said
but
his
words
and
carriage
showed
much
of
a
gentleman
my
lord
had
a
great
kindness
for
him
but
did
not
think
it
safe
to
release
him
but
a
while
after
he
sent
a
letter
down
to
my
lord
which
my
lord
did
like
very
well
and
did
advise
with
me
that
the
gentleman
was
to
be
released
so
i
went
up
and
sat
and
talked
with
him
in
latin
and
french
and
about
eleven
at
night

took
boat
again
and
so
god
bless
him

troubled
for
his
missing

we
lie
still
a
little
below
gravesend
at
night
shepley
returned
from
london
and
told
us
of
several
elections
for
the
next
parliament
that
the
king
effigies
was
new
making
to
be
set
up
in
the
exchange
again
this
evening
was
a
great
whispering
that
some
of
the
captains
were
dissatisfied
and
did
intend
to
fight
themselves
to
oppose
the
general
but
it
was
soon
hushed
and
the
did
wholly
deny
any
such
thing
and
protested
to
stand
by
the
general
this
day
while
my
lord
and
we
were
at
dinner
the
nazeby
came
in
sight
towards
us
and
at
last
came
to
anchor
close

thing
was
out
of

did
give
me
a
private
list
of
all
the
ships
that
were
to
be
set
out
this
summer
wherein
i
do
discover
that
he
hath
made
it
his
care
to
put
by
as
much
of
the
anabaptists
as
he
can
by
reason
of
my
lord
and
my
being
busy
to
send
away
the
packet
by
cooke
of
the
naseby
it
was
four
before

from

who
tells
me
that

come
in
and
that
the
soldiers
at

do
drink
the
king
health
in
the
streets
up
very
early
and
to
get
all
my
things
and
my
boy
packed
up
great
concourse
of
commanders
here
this
morning
to
take
leave
of
my
lord
upon
his
going
into
the
nazeby
this
morning
comes
ed
pickering
brother
to
sir
gilbert
pickering
bart
he
tells
me
that
the
king
will
come
in
but
that
monk
did
resolve
to
have
the
doing
of
it
himself
or
else
to
hinder
it
there
come
many
merchants
to
get
convoy
to
the
baltique
which
a
course
was
taken
for
they
dined
with
my
lord
and
one
of
them
by
name
alderman
wood
talked
much
to
my
lord
of
the
hopes
that
he
had
now
to
be
settled
under
the
king
he
meant
but
my
lord
took
no
notice
of
it
this
day
come
the
lieutenant
of
the
swiftsure
who
was
sent
by
my
lord
to
hastings
one
of
the
cinque
ports
to
have
got
edward
montagu
to
have
been
one
of
their
burgesses
but

not
for
they
were
all
promised
before
this
morning
come
colonel
thomson
with
the
wooden
leg
and
pen
and
dined
with
my
lord
and
blackburne
who
told
me
that
it
was
certain
now
that
the
king
must
of
necessity
come
in
and
that
one
of
the
council
told
him
there
is
something
doing
in
order
to
a
treaty
already
among
them
and
it
was
strange
to
hear
how
blackburne
did
already
begin
to
commend
him
for
a
sober
man
and
how
quiet
he
would
be
under
his
government
the
commissioners
come
only
to
consult
about
a
further
reducement
of
the
fleet
and
to
pay
them
as
fast
as
they
can
at
night
my
lord
resolved
to
send
the
captain
of
our
ship
to
waymouth
and
promote
his
being
chosen
there
which
he
did
put
himself
into
readiness
to
do
the
next
morning
this
afternoon
i
first
saw
france
and
calais
with
which
i
was
much
pleased
though
it
was
at
a
distance
a
gentleman
came
from
my
lord
of
manchester
to
my
lord
for
a
pass
for
boyle
the
celebrated
robert
boyle
youngest
son
of
richard
first
earl
of
cork
which
was
made
him
all
the
news
from
london
is
that
things
go
on
further
towards
a
king
that
the
skinners
company
the
other
day
at
their
entertaining
general
monk
had
took
down
the
parliament
arms
in
their
hall
and
set
up
the
king
my
lord
and
i
had
a
great
deal
of
discourse
about
the
several
captains
of
the
fleet
and
his
interest
among
them
and
had
his
mind
clear
to
bring
in
the
king
he
confessed
to
me
that
he
was
not
sure
of
his
own
captain
to
be
true
to
him
and
that
he
did
not
like
capt
stokes
this
day
i
was
informed
that
my
lord
lambert
is
got
out
of
the
tower
and
that
there
is
proffered
to
whoever
shall
bring
him
forth
to
the
council
of
state
my
lord
is
chosen
at
weymouth
this
morning
my
lord
had
his
freedom
brought
him
by
capt
tiddiman
of
the
port
of
dover
by
which
he
is
capable
of
being
elected
for
them
this
day
i
heard
that
the
army
had
in
general
declared
to
stand
by
what
the
next
parliament
shall
do
lord
day
to
sermon
and
then
to
dinner
where
my
lord
told
us
that
the
university
of
cambridge
had
a
mind
to
choose
him
for
their
burgess
which
he
pleased
himself
with
to
think
that
they
do
look
upon
him
as
a
thriving
man
and
said
so
openly
at
table
at
cooke
came
hack
from
london
with
a
packet
which
caused
my
lord
to
be
full
of
thoughts
all
day
and
at
night
he
bid
me
privately
to
get
two
commissions
ready
one
for
capt
robert
blake
to
be
captain
of
the
worcester
in
the
room
of
capt
dekings
an
anabaptist
and
one
that
had
witnessed
a
great
deal
of
discontent
with
the
present
proceedings
the
other
for
capt
coppin
to
come
out
of
that
into
the
newbury
in
the
room
of
blake
whereby
i
perceive
that
general
monk
do
resolve
to
make
a
thorough
change
to
make
way
for
the
king
from
london
i
hear
that
since
lambert
got
out
of
the
tower
the
fanatiques
had
held
up
their
heads
high
but
i
hope
all
that
will
come
to
nothing
all
the
morning
getting
ready
commissions
for
the
admiral
and
the
admiral
wherein
my
lord
was
very
careful
to
express
the
utmost
of
his
own
power
commanding
them
to
obey
what
orders
they
should
receive
from
the
parliament
of
both
or
either
of
the
generals
my
lord
told
me
clearly
his
thoughts
that
the
king
would
carry
it
and
that
he
did
not
think
himself
very
happy
that
he
was
now
at
sea
as
well
for
his
own
sake
as
that
he
thought
he
might
do
his
country
some
service
in
keeping
things
quiet
cooke
returned
from
london
bringing
me
this
news
that
the
cavaliers
are
something
unwise
to
talk
so
high
on
the
other
side
as
they
do
that
the
lords
do
meet
every
day
at
my
lord
of
manchester
and
resolve
to
sit
the
first
day
of
the
parliament
that
it
is
evident
now
that
the
general
and
the
council
do
resolve
to
make
way
for
the
king
coming
and
it
is
clear
that
either
the
fanatiques
must
now
be
undone
or
the
gentry
and
citizens
throughout
england
and
clergy
must
fall
in
spite
of
their
militia
and
army
which
is
not
at
all
possible
i
think
at
dinner
news
brought
us
that
my
lord
was
chosen
at
dover
this
evening
come
boyle
on
board
for
whom
i
writ
an
order
for
a
ship
to
transport
him
to
flushing
he
supped
with
my
lord
my
lord
using
him
as
a
person
of
honour
shepley
told
me
that
he
heard
for
certain
at
dover
that
edw
montagu
eldest
son
of
edward
second
lord
montagu
of
boughton
killed
at
berghen
did
go
beyond
sea
when
he
was
here
first
the
other
day
and
i
am
apt
to
believe
that
he
went
to
speak
with
the
king
this
day
one
told
me
how
that
at
the
election
at
cambridge
for
knights
of
the
shire
wendby
and
thornton
by
declaring
to
stand
for
the
parliament
and
a
king
and
the
settlement
of
the
church
did
carry
it
against
all
expectation
against
sir
dudley
north
and
sir
thomas
willis
willis
had
represented
cambridgeshire
in
the
preceding
parliament
this
day
dined
sir
john
boys
gentleman
of
the
chamber
and
some
other
gentlemen
formerly
great
cavaliers
and
among
the
rest
one
norwood
a
major
norwood
had
been
governor
of
dunkirk
and
a
person
of
the
same
name
occurs
as
one
of
the
esquires
of
the
body
at
the
coronation
of
charles
the
second
for
whom
my
lord
give
a
convoy
to
carry
him
to
the
brill
but
he
is
certainly
going
to
the
king
for
my
lord
commanded
me
that
i
should
not
enter
his
name
in
my
book
my
lord
do
show
them
and
that
sort
of
people
great
civility
all
their
discourse
and
others
are
of
the
king
coming
and
we
begin
to
speak
of
it
very
freely
and
heard
how
in
many
churches
in
london
and
upon
many
signs
there
and
upon
merchants
ships
in
the
river
they
had
set
up
the
king
arms
this
night
there
came
one
with
a
letter
from
edw
montagu
to
my
lord
with
command
to
deliver
it
to
his
own
hands
i
do
believe
that
he
do
carry
some
close
business
on
for
the
king
this
day
i
had
a
large
letter
from
moore
giving
me
an
account
of
the
present
dispute
at
london
that
is
like
to
be
at
the
beginning
of
the
parliament
about
the
house
of
lords
who
do
resolve
to
sit
with
the
commons
as
not
thinking
themselves
dissolved
yet
which
whether
it
be
granted
or
no
or
whether
they
will
sit
or
no
it
will
bring
a
great
many
inconveniences
his
letter
i
keep
it
being
a
very
well
writ
one
several
londoners
strangers
friends
of
the
captains
dined
here
who
among
other
things
told
us
how
the
king
arms
are
every
day
set
up
in
houses
and
churches
particularly
in
allhallows
church
in
john
simpson
church
which
being
privately
done
was
a
great
to
his
people
when
they
came
to
church
and
saw
it
also
they
told
us
for
certain
that
the
king
statue
is
making
by
the
mercers
company
who
are
bound
to
do
it
to
set

me
how
sir
yelverton
formerly
my
schoolfellow
of
easton
mauduit
grandson
to
the
attorney
general
of
both
his
names
ob
was
chosen
in
the
first
place
for
northamptonshire
and
crewe
in
the
second
and
told
me
how
he
did
believe
that
the
cavaliers
have
now
the
upper
hand
clear
of
the
presbyterians
after
dinner
came
on
board
sir
thomas
hatton
of
long
stanton
cambridge
bart
and
sir
maleverer
of
allerton
maleverer
yorkshire
bart
going
for
flushing
but
all
the
world
know
that
they
go
where
the
rest
of
the
many
gentlemen
go
that
every
day
flock
to
the
king
at
breda
they
supped
here
and
my
lord
treated
them
as
he
do
the
rest
that
go
thither
with
a
great
deal
of
civility
while
we
were
at
supper
a
packet
came
wherein
much
news
from
several
friends
the
chief
is
that
that
i
had
from
moore
viz
that
he
fears
the
cavaliers
in
the
house
will
be
so
high
that
the
other
will
be
forced
to
leave
the
house
and
fall
in
with
general
monk
and
so
offer
things
to
the
king
so
high
on
the
presbyterian
account
that
he
may
refuse
and
so
they
will
endeavour
some
more
mischief
but
when
i
told
my
lord
it
he
shook
his
head
and
told
me
that
the
presbyterians
are
deceived
for
the
general
is
certainly
for
the
interest
and
so
they
will
not
be
able
to
prevail
that
way
with
him
after
supper
the
two
knights
went
on
board
the
grantham
that
is
to
convey
them
to
flushing
i
am
informed
that
the
exchequer
is
now
so
low
that
there
is
not
there
to
give
the
messenger
that
brought
the
news
of
lambert
being
taken
which
story
is
very
strange
that
he
should
lose
his
reputation
of
being
a
man
of
courage
now
at
one
blow
for
that
he
was
not
able
to
fight
one
stroke
but
desired
of
colonel
igoldsby
several
times
to
let
him
escape
late
reading
my
letters
my
mind
being
much
troubled
to
think
that
after
all
our
hopes
we
should
have
any
cause
to
fear
any
more
disappointments
therein
after
sermon
in
the
morning
cooke
came
from
london
with
a
packet
bringing
news
how
all
the
young
lords
that
were
not
in
arms
against
the
parliament
do
now
sit
that
a
letter
is
come
from
the
king
to
the
house

up
by
the

it
may
be
read
in
the
open
house
when
they
meet
again
they
having
adjourned
till
then
to
keep
a
fast
and
so
the
contents
is
not
yet
known
of
the
given
to
general
monk
is
paid
out
of
the
exchequer
he
giving
among
the
teller
clerks
of
exchequer
my
lord
called
me
into
the
great
cabbin
below
where
he
told
me
that
the
presbyterians
are
quite
mastered
by
the
cavaliers
and
that
he
fears
crewe
did
go
a
little
too
far
the
other
day
in
keeping
out
the
young
lords
from
a
sitting
that
he
do
expect
that
the
king
should
be
brought
over
suddenly
without
staying
to
make
any
terms
at
all
saying
that
the
presbyterians
did
intend
to
have
brought
him
in
with
such
conditions
as
if
he
had
been
in
chains
but
he
shook
his
shoulders
when
he
told
me
how
monk
had
betrayed
him
for
it
was
he
that
did
put
them
upon
standing
to
put
out
the
lords
and
other
members
that
come
not
within
the
qualifications
which
he
did
not
like
but
however
he
had
done
his
business
though
it
be
with
some
kind
of
baseness
after
dinner
i
walked
a
great
while
upon
the
deck
with
the
chyrurgeon
and
purser
and
other
officers
of
the
ship
and
they
all
pray
for
the
king
coming

i
pray
god
send

i
hear

were
very
merry

their
maypoles
and
drinking
his
health
upon
their
knees

firing
the

the
soldiers
of
the

a
year

england
the
king
letter
was
read
in
the
house
wherein
he
submits
himself
and
all
things
to
them
as
to
an
act
of
oblivion
to
all
unless
they
shall
please
to
except
any
as
to
the
confirming
of
the
sales
of
the

of
thanks
to
his
majesty
for
his
gracious
letter
and
that
the
letter

kept
among
the
records
of
the
parliament
and
in
all
this
not
so
much
as
one
no
so
that
luke
robinson
himself
stood
up
and
made
a
recantation
of
what

little
too
much
but
every
body
seems
to
be
very
joyfull
in
the
business
insomuch
that
our
now
begin
to
say
so
too
which
a
week

little
time
here
which
my
lord
was
a
little
troubled
at
but
he
seems
to
be
a
fine
gentleman
and
at
night
did
play
his
part
exceeding
well
at
first
sight
this
morning
my
lord
showed
me
the
king
declaration
and
his
letter
to
the
two

other
things

year
of
his
reign
upon
the
receipt
of

this
morning
by
an
express

one
of
the
messengers
of
the
council
from
general
monk
my
lord
summoned
a
council
of
war
and
in
the
meantime
did
dictate
to
me
how
he
would
have
the
vote
ordered
which
he
would
have
pass
this
council
which
done
the
commanders
all
came
on
board

the
coach
coach

a
the
council
chamber
the
first
council
of
war
that
had
been
in
my
time
where
i
read
the
letter
and
declaration
and
while
they
were
discoursing
upon
it
i
seemed
to
draw
up
a
vote
which
being
offered
they
passed
not
one
man
seemed
to
say
no
to
it
though
i
am
confident
many
in
their
hearts
were
against
it
after
this
was
done
i
went
up
to
the
with
my
lord
and
the
commanders
and
there
read
both
the
papers
and
the
vote
which
done
and
demanding
their
opinion
the
seamen
did
all
of
them
cry
out

bless
king

with
the
greatest
joy
imaginable
that
being
done
sir
stayner
knighted
and
made
a
admiral
by
cromwell
and
sent
by
charles
ii
to
command
tangier
till
the

arrived
who
had
invited
us
yesterday
took
all
the
commanders
and
myself
on
board
him
to
dinner
which
not
being
ready
i
went
with
captain
hayward
the
plymouth
and
essex
and
did
what
i
had
to
do
and
returned
where
very
merry
at
dinner
after
dinner
to
the
rest
of
the
ships
quite
through
the
fleet
which
was
a
very
brave
sight
to
visit
all
the
ships
and
to
be
received
with
the
respect
and
honour
that
i
was
on
board
them
all
and
much
more
to
see
the
great
joy
that
i
brought
to
all
men
not
one
through
the
whole
fleet
showing
the
least
dislike
of
the
business
in
the
evening
as
i
was
going
on
board
the
the
general
began
to
fire
his
guns
which
he
did
all
that
he
had
in
the
ship
and
so
did
all
the
rest
of
the
commanders
which
was
very
gallant
and
to
hear
the
bullets
go
hissing
over
our
heads
as
we
were
in
the
boat
this
done
and
finished
my
proclamation
i
returned
to
the
nazeby
where
my
lord
was
much
pleased
to
hear
how
all
the
fleet
took
it
in
a
transport
of
joy
showed
me
a
private
letter
of
the
king
to
him
and
another
from
the
duke
of
york
in
such
familiar
style
as
their
common
friend
with
all
kindness
imaginable
and
i
found
by
the
letters
and
so
my
lord
told
me
too
that
there
had
been
many
letters
passed
between
them
for
a
great
while
and
i
perceive
unknown
to
monk
among
the
rest
that
had
carried
these
letters
sir
john
boys
is
one
and
norwood
which
had
a
ship
to
carry
him
over
the
other
day
when
my
lord
would
not
have
me
put
down
his
name
in
the
book
the
king
speaks
of
him
being
courted
to
come
to
the
hague
but
to
desire
my
lord
advice
where
to
come
to
take
ship
and
the
duke
offers
to
learn
the
seaman
trade
of
him
in
such
familiar
words
as
if
jack
cole
and
i
had
writ
them
this
was
very
strange
to
me
that
my
lord
should
carry
all
things
so
wisely
and
prudently
as
he
do
and
i
was
over
joyful
to
see
him
in
so
good
condition
and
he
did
not
a
little
please
himself
to
tell
me
how
he
had
provided
for
himself
so
great
a
hold
on
the
king
after
this
to
supper
and
then
to
writing
of
letters
till
twelve
at
night
and
so
up
again
at
three
in
the
morning
my
lord
seemed
to
put
great
confidence
in
me
and
would
take
my
advice
in
many
things
i
perceive
his
being
willing
to
do
all
the
honour
in
the
world
to
monk
and
to
let
him
have
all
the
honour
of
doing
the
business
though
he
will
many
times
express
his
thoughts
of
him
to
be
but
a
fool
so
that
i
do
believe
there
is
some
agreement
more
than
ordinary
between
the
king
and
my
lord
to
let
monk
carry
on
the
business
for
it
is
he
that
can
do
the
business
or
at
least
that
can
hinder
it
if
he
be
not
flattered
and
observed
this
my
lord
will
hint
himself
sometimes
my
lord
i
perceive
by
the
king
letter
had
writ
to
him
about
his
father
crewe
he
had
married
jemima
daughter
of
john
crewe
created
afterwards
baron
crewe
of
stene
and
the
king
did
speak
well
of
him
but
my
lord
tells
me
that
he
is
afraid
that
he
hath
too
much
concerned
himself
with
the
presbyterians
against
the
house
of
lords
which
will
do
him
a
great
discourtesy
i
wrote
this
morning
many
letters
and
to
all
the
copies
of
the
vote
of
the
council
of
war
i
put
my
name
that
if
it
should
come
in
print
my
name
may
be
to
it
i
sent
a
copy
of
the
vote
to
doling
inclosed
in
this
letter
sir
he
that
can
fancy
a
fleet
like
ours
in
her
pride
with
pendants
loose
guns
roaring
caps
flying
and
the
loud
vive
le
roy
echoed
from
one
ship
company
to
another
he
and
he
only
can
apprehend
the
joy
this
inclosed
vote
was
received
with
or
the
blessing
he
thought
himself
possessed
of
that
bore
it
and
is
your
humble
servant
about
nine
i
got
all
my
letters
done
and
sent
them
by
the
messenger
that
come
yesterday
this
morning
come
captain
isham
on

with
a
gentleman
going
to
the

by
whom
very
cunningly
my
lord
tells
me
he
intends
to
send
an
account
of
this
day
and
yesterday
actions
here
notwithstanding
he
had
writ
to
the
parliament
to
have
leave
of
them
to
send
the
king
the
answer
of
the
fleete
since
my
writing
of
the
last
paragraph
my
lord
called
me
to
him
to
read
his
letter
to
the
king
to
see
whether
i
could
find
any
slips
in
it
or
no
and
as
much
of
the
letter
as
i
can
remember
is
thus
may
it
please
your
most
excellent
majesty
and
so
begins
that
he
yesterday
received
from
general
monk
his
majesty
letter
and
direction
and
that
general
monk
had
desired
him
to
write
to
the
parliament
to
have
leave
to
send
the
vote
of
the
seamen
before
he
did
send
it
to
him
which
he
had
done
by
writing
to
both
speakers
but
for
his
private
satisfaction
he
had
sent
it
thus
privately
and
so
the
copy
of
the
proceedings
yesterday
was
sent
him
and
that
this
come
by
a
gentleman
that
come
this
day
on
board
intending
to
wait
upon
his
majesty
that
he
is
my
countryman
and
one
whose
friends
have
suffered
much
on
his
majesty
behalf
that
my
lords
pembroke
and
salisbury
are
put
out
of
the
house
of
lords
philip
fifth
earl
of
pembroke
and
second
earl
of
montgomery
ob
clarendon
says
this
young
earl
affections
were
entire
for
his
majesty
williams
second
earl
of
salisbury
after
cromwell
had
put
down
the
house
of
peers
he
was
chosen
a
member
of
the
house
of
commons
and
sat
with
them
ob
that
my
lord
is
very
joyful
that
other
countries
do
pay
him
the
civility
and
respect
due
to
him
and
that
he
do
much
rejoice
to
see
that
the
king
do
receive
none
of
their
assistance
or
some
such
words
from
them
he
having
strength
enough
in
the
love
and
loyalty
of
his
own
subjects
to
support
him
that
his
majesty
had
chosen
the
best
place
scheveling
for
his
embarking
and
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
of
which
he
is
more
ambitions
than
to
have
the
honour
of
attending
his
majesty
which
he
hoped
would
be
speedy
that
he
had
commanded
the
vessel
to
attend
at
helversluce
till
this
gentleman
returns
that
so
if
his
majesty
do
not
think
it
fit
to
command
the
fleete
himself
yet
that
he
may
be
there
to
receive
his
commands
and
bring
them
to
his
lordship
he
ends
his
letter
that
he
is
confounded
with
the
thoughts
of
the
high
expressions
of
love
to
him
in
the
king
letter
and

the
king
did
give
the
reason
of
it
openly
that
it
was
for
his
giving
him
intelligence
all
the
time
he
was
clerk
to
secretary
thurloe
samuel
morland
successively
scholar
and
fellow
of
magdalene
college
and
pepys
tutor
there
became
afterwards
one
of
thurloe
under
secretaries
and
was
employed
in
several
embassies
by
cromwell
whose
interests
he
betrayed
by
secretly
communicating
with
charles
the
second
in
consideration
of
these
services
he
was
created
a
baronet
of
sulhamstead
banister
berks
after
the
restoration
he
was
an
ingenious
mechanic
supposed
by
some
persons
to
have
invented
the
steam
engine
and
lived
to
an
advanced
age
in
the
afternoon
a
council
of
war
only
to
acquaint
them
that
the
harp
must
be
taken
out
of
all
their
flags
it
being
very
offensive
to
the
king
late
at
night
we
writ
letters
to
the
king
of
the
news
of
our
coming
and
edward
pickering
carried
them
sir
gilbert
pickering
eldest
son
capt
isham
went
on
shore
nobody
showing
of
him
any
respect
so
the
old
man
very
fairly
took
leave
of
my
lord
and
my
lord
very
coldly
bid
him
god
be
with
you
which
was
very
strange
but
that
i
hear
that
he
keeps
a
great
deal
of
prating
and
talking
on
shore
on
board
at
the
courts
what
command
he
had
with
my
lord
in
the
morning
the
hague
was
clearly
to
be
seen
by
us
my
lord
went
up
in
his
nightgown
into
the
cuddy
to
see
how
to
dispose
thereof
for
himself
and
us
that
belong
to
him
to
give
order
for
our
removal
some
nasty
dutchmen
came
on
board
to
proffer
their
boats
to
carry
things
from
us
on
shore
to
get
money
by
us
before
noon
some
gentlemen
came
on
board
from
the
shore
to
kiss
my
lord
hands
and
by
and
by
north
and
clerke
went
to
kiss
the
queen
of
bohemia
hands
daughter
of
james
the
first
from
my
lord
with
twelve
attendants
from
on
board
to
wait
on
them
among
which
i
sent
my
boy
who
like
myself
is
with
child
to
see
any
strange
thing
after
noon
they
came
back
again
after
having
kissed
the
queen
of
bohemia
hand
and
were
sent
again
by
my
lord
to
do
the
same
to
the
prince
of
orange
afterwards
william
the
third
so
i
got
the
captain
to
ask
leave
for
me
to
go
which
my
lord
did
give
and
taking
my
boy
and
with
me
went
in
company
with
them
the
weather
was
bad
we
were
sadly
washed
when
we
come
near
the
shore
it
being
very
hard
to
land
there
the
shore
is
so
all
the
country
between
that
and
the
hague
all
sand
the
hague
is
a
most
neat
place
in
all
respects
the
houses
so
neat
in
all
places
and
things
as
is
possible
here
we
walked
up
and
down
a
great
while
the
town
being
now
very
full
of
englishmen
for
that
the
londoners
were
come
on
shore
but
going
to
see
the
prince
henry
duke
of
gloucester
charles
the
second
youngest
brother
he
was
gone
forth
with
his
governor
and
so
we
walked
up
and
down
the
town
and
court
to
see
the
place
and
by
the
help
of
a
stranger
an
englishman
we
saw
a
great
many
places
and
were
made
to
understand
many
things
as
the
intention
of
poles
which
we
saw
there
standing
at
every
great
man
door
of
different
greatness
according
to
the
quality
of
the
person
about
ten
at
night
the
prince
comes
home
and
we
found
an
easy
admission
his
attendance
very
inconsiderable
as
for
a
prince
but
yet
handsome
and
his
tutor
a
fine
man
and
himself
a
very
pretty
boy
coming
on
board
we
found
all
the
commissioners
of
the
house
of
lords
at
dinner
with
my
lord
who
after
dinner
went
away
for
shore
morland
now
sir
samuel
was
here
on
board
but
i
do
not
find
that
my
lord
or
any
body
did
give
him
any
respect
he
being
looked
upon
by
him
and
all
men
as
a
knave
among
others
he
betrayed
sir
rich
willis
that
married
jones
daughter
who
had
paid
him
at
one
time
by
the
protector
and
secretary
thurloe
order
for
intelligence
that
he
sent
concerning
the
king
in
the
afternoon
my
lord
called
me
on
purpose
to
show
me
his
fine
cloathes
which
are
now
come
hither
and
indeed
are
very
rich
as
gold
and
silver
can
make
them
only
his
sword
he
and
i
do
not
like
in
the
afternoon
my
lord
and
i
walked
together
in
the
coach
two
hours
talking
together
upon
all
sorts
of
discourse
as
religion
wherein
he
is
i
perceive
wholly
sceptical
saying
that
indeed
the
protestants
as
to
the
church
of
rome
are
wholly
fanatiques
he
likes
uniformity
and
form
of
prayer
about
among
other
things
he
told
me
that
his
conversion
to
the
king
cause
for
i
was
saying
that
i
wondered
from
what
time
the
king
could
look
upon
him
to
become
his
friend
commenced
from
his
being
in
the
sound
when
he
found
what
usage
he
was
likely
to
have
from
a
commonwealth
my
lord
the
captain
and
i
supped
in
my
lord
chamber
where
i
did
perceive
that
he
did
begin
to
show
me
much
more
respect
than
ever
he
did
yet
after
supper
my
lord
sent
for
me
intending
to
have
me
play
at
cards
with
him
but
i
not
knowing
cribbage
we
fell
into
discourse
of
many
things
and
the
ship
rolled
so
much
that
i
was
not
able
to
stand
and
he
bid
me
go
to
bed
may
come
in
some
with
visits
among
the
rest
one
from
admiral
opdam
the
celebrated
dutch
admiral
who
spoke
latin
well
but
not
french
nor
english
whom
my
lord
made
me
to
entertain
commissioner
pett
naval
commissioner
at
chatham
was
now
come
to
take
care
to
get
all
things
ready
for
the
king
on
board
my
lord
in
his
best
suit
this
the
first
day
in
expectation
to
wait
upon
the
king
but
edw
pickering
coming
from
the
king
brought
word
that
the
king
would
not
put
my
lord
to
the
trouble
of
coming
to
him
but
that
he
would
come
to
the
shore
to
look
upon
the
fleet
which
we
expected
and
had
our
guns
ready
to
fire
and
our
scarlet
out
and
silk
pendants
but
he
did
not
come
this
evening
came
john
pickering
on
board
like
an
asse
with
his
feathers
and
new
suit
that
he
had
made
at
the
hague
my
lord
very
angry
for
him
staying
on
shore
bidding
me
a
little
before
to
send
for
him
telling
me
that
he
was
afraid
that
for
his
father
sake
he
might
have
some
mischief
done
him
unless
he
used
the
general
name
this
afternoon
edw
pickering
told
me
in
what
a
sad
poor
condition
for
clothes
and
money
the
king
was
and
all
his
attendants
when
he
came
to
him
first
from
my
lord
their
clothes
not
being
worth
forty
shillings
the
best
of
them
and
how
overjoyed
the
king
was
when
sir
greenville
brought
him
some
money
so
joyful
that
he
called
the
princess
royal
mary
eldest
daughter
of
charles
and
widow
of
the
prince
of
orange
who
died
she
was
carried
off
by
the
december
leaving
a
son
afterwards
king
william
iii
and
duke
of
york
to
look
upon
it
as
it
lay
in
the
portmanteau
before
it
was
taken
out
my
lord
told
me
too
that
the
duke
of
york
is
made
high
admiral
of
england
clerke
came
to
me
to
tell
me
that
he
heard
this
morning
by
some
dutch
that
are
come
on
board
already
to
see
the
ships
that
there
was
a
portuguese
taken
yesterday
at
the
hague
that
had
a
design
to
kill
the
king
but
this
i
heard
afterwards
was
only
the
mistake
upon
one
being
observed
to
walk
with
his
sword
naked
he
having
lost
his
scabbard
before
dinner
edw
pickering
and
i
howe
pim
and
my
boy
to
scheveling
where
we
took
coach
and
so
to
the
hague
where
walking
intending
to
find
one
that
might
show
us
the
king
incognito
i
met
with
captn
whittington
that
had
formerly
brought
a
letter
to
my
lord
from
the
mayor
of
london
and
he
did
promise
me
to
do
it
but
first
we
went
and
dined
at
dinner
in
came
cade
a
merry
mad
parson
of
the
king
and
they
two
got
the
child
and
me
the
others
not
being
able
to
crowd
in
to
see
the
king
who
kissed
the
child
very
affectionately
then
we
kissed
his
and
the
duke
of
york
and
the
princess
royal
hands
the
king
seems
to
be
a
very
sober
man
and
a
very
splendid
court
he
hath
in
the
number
of
persons
of
quality
that
are
about
him
english
very
rich
in
habit
from
the
king
to
the
lord
chancellor
who
did
lie
of
the
gout
he
spoke
very
merrily
to
the
child
and
me
after
that
going
to
see
the
queen
of
bohemia
i
met
fuller
whom
i
sent
to
a
tavern
with
edw
pickering
while
i
and
the
rest
went
to
see
the
queen
who
used
us
very
respectfully
her
hand
we
all
kissed
she
seems
a
very
debonaire
but
a
plain
lady
in
a
coach
we
went
to
see
a
house
of
the
princess
dowager
mary
daughter
of
charles
i
in
a
park
about
a
mile
from
the
hague
where
there
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
rooms
for
pictures
in
the
whole
world
she
had
here
one
picture
upon
the
top
with
these
words
dedicating
it
to
the
memory
of
her
husband
incomparabili
marito
inconsolabilis
vidua
very
early
up
and
hearing
that
the
duke
of
york
our
lord
high
admiral
would
go
on
board
pickering
and
i
took
waggon
for
scheveling
but
the
wind
being
so
very
high
that
no
boats
could
get
off
from
shore
we
returned
to
the
hague
having
breakfasted
with
a
gentleman
of
the
duke
and
commissioner
pett
sent
on
purpose
to
give
notice
to
my
lord
of
his
coming
we
got
a
boy
of
the
town
to
go
along
with
us
and
he
showed
us
the
church
where
van
trump
lies
entombed
with
a
very
fine
monument
his
epitaph
is
concluded
thus
tandem
bello
anglico
tantum
non
victor
certe
invictus
vivere
et
vincere
desiit
there
is
a
cut
in
marble
with
the
smoake
the
best
expressed
that
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
from
thence
to
the
great
church
that
stands
in
a
fine
great
over
against
the
and
there
i
saw
a
stately
tombe
of
the
old
prince
of
orange
of
marble
and
brass
wherein
among
other
rarities
there
are
the
angels
with
their
trumpets
expressed
as
it
were
crying
there
were
very
fine
organs
in
both
the
churches
it
is
a
most
sweet
town
with
bridges
and
a
river
in
every
street
we
met
with
commissioner
pett
going
down
to
the
side
with
major
harly
who
is
going
upon
a
dispatch
into
england
up
early
and
went
to
scheveling
where
i
found
no
getting
on
board
though
the
duke
of
york
sent
every
day
to
see
whether
he
could
do
it
or
no
by
waggon
to
lausdune
where
the
children
were
born
we
saw
the
hill
where
they
say
the
house
stood
wherein
the
children
were
born
the
basins
wherein
the
male
and
female
children
were
baptised
do
stand
over
a
large
table
that
hangs
upon
a
wall
with
the
whole
story
of
the
thing
in
dutch
and
latin
beginning
margarita
herman
comitissa
the
thing
was
done
about
years
ago
commissioner
pett
at
last
came
to
our
lodging
and
caused
the
boats
to
go
off
so
some
in
one
boat
and
some
in
another
we
all
bid
adieu
to
the
shore
but
through
the
badness
of
weather
we
were
in
great
danger
and
a
great
while
before
we
could
get
to
the
ship
this
hath
not
been
known
four
days
together
such
weather
this
time
of
year
a
great
while
indeed
our
fleet
was
thought
to
be
in
great
danger
but
we
found
all
well
the
weather
foul
all
this
day
also
after
dinner
about
writing
one
thing
or
other
all
day
and
setting
my
papers
in
order
hearing
by
letters
that
came
hither
in
my
absence
that
the
parliament
had
ordered
all
persons
to
be
secured
in
order
to
a
trial
that
did
sit
as
judges
in
the
late
king
death
and
all
the
officers
attending
the
court
sir
john
lenthall
moving
in
the
house
that
all
that
had
borne
arms
against
the
king
should
be
exempted
from
pardon
he
was
called
to
the
bar
of
the
house
and
after
a
severe
reproof
he
was
degraded
his
knighthood
at
court
i
find
that
all
things
grow
high
the
old
clergy
talk
as
being
sure
of
their
lands
again
and
laugh
at
the
presbytery
and
it
is
believed
that
the
sales
of
the
king
and
bishops
lands
will
never
be
confirmed
by
parliament
there
being
nothing
now
in
any
man
power
to
hinder
them
and
the
king
from
doing
what
they
had
a
mind
but
everybody
willing
to
submit
to
any
thing
we
expect
every
day
to
have
the
king
and
duke
on
board
as
soon
as
it
is
fair
my
lord
does
nothing
now
but
offers
all
things
to
the
pleasure
of
the
duke
as
lord
high
admiral
so
that
i
am
at
a
loss
what
to
do
news
brought
that
the
two
dukes
are
coming
on
board
which
by
and

in
a
dutch

yellow
trimmings

a
boat
to
meet
them
the
captain
myself
and
others
standing
at
the
entering
port
so
soon
as
they
were
entered
we
shot
the
guns
off
round
the
fleet
after
that
they
went
to
view
the
ship
all
over
and
were
most
exceedingly
pleased
with
it
they
seem
to
be
very
fine
gentlemen

the
table
under
the
awning

very
well
pleased
with
this
day
work
by
the
time
we
came
on
board
again
news
is
sent
us
that
the

is
on
shore

my

after
him
the
gun
over
against
my
cabbin
i
fired
myself
to
the
king
which
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
saluted
by
his
own
ships
since
this
change
but
holding
my
head
too
much
over
the
gun
i
had
almost
spoiled
my
right
eye
nothing
in
the
world
but
giving
of
guns
almost
all
this
day

sorts
come
to
see
the
ship
till
it
was
quite
dark
that

not
pass
by
one
another

was
a
great
trouble
to
us

this
afternoon

yesterday
by

here
on

shooting

exceeding
full

the

we
weighed
anchor
and
with
a
fresh
gale
and
most
happy
weather
we
set
sail
for
england
all
the
afternoon
the
king
walked
here
and
there
up
and
down
quite
contrary
to
what
i
thought
him
to
have
been
very
active
and
stirring
upon
the
he
fell
into
discourse
of
his
escape
from
worcester
where
it
made
me
ready
to
weep
to
hear
the
stories
that
he
told
of
his
difficulties
that
he
had
passed
through
as
his
travelling
four
days
and
three
nights
on
foot
every
step
up
to
his
knees
in
dirt
with
nothing
but
a
green
coat
and
a
pair
of
country
breeches
on
and
a
pair
of
country
shoes
that
made
him
so
sore
all
over
his
feet
that
he
could
scarce
stir
yet
he
was
forced
to
run
away
from
a
miller
and
other
company
that
took
them
for
rogues
his
sitting
at
table
at
one
place
where
the
master
of
the
house
that
had
not
seen
him
in
eight
years
did
know
him
but
kept
it
private
when
at
the
same
table
there
was
one
that
had
been
of
his
own
regiment
at
worcester
could
not
know
him
but
made
him
drink
the
king
health
and
said
that
the
king
was
at
least
four
fingers
higher
than
he
at
another
place
he
was
by
some
servants
of
the
house
made
to
drink
that
they
might
know
that
he
was
not
a
roundhead
which
they
swore
he
was
in
another
place
at
his
inn
the
master
of
the
house
as
the
king
was
standing
with
his
hands
upon
the
back
of
a
chair
by
the
side
kneeled
down
and
kissed
his
hand
privately
saying
that
he
would
not
ask
him
who
he
was
but
bid
god
bless
him
whither
he
was
going
then
the
difficulties
in
getting
a
boat
to
get
into
france
where
he
was
fain
to
plot
with
the
master
thereof
to
keep
his
design
from
the
foreman
and
a
boy
which
was
all
the
company
and
so
get
to
fecamp
in
france
at
rouen
he
looked
so
poorly
that
the
people
went
into
the
rooms
before
he
went
away
to
see
whether
he
had
not
stole
something
or
other
in
the
evening
i
went
up
to
my
lord
to
write
letters
for
england
which
we
sent
away
with
word
of
our
coming
by
edw
pickering
the
king
supped
alone
in
the
coach
after
that
i
got
a
dish
and
we
four
supped
in
my
cabbin
as
at
noon
about
my
lord
bartlett
a
mistake
for

berkeley
who
had
been
deputed
with

and
four
other
peers
by
the
house
of
lords
to
present
an
address
of
congratulation
to
the
king
who
i
had
offered
my
service
to
before
sent
for
me
to
get
him
a
bed

with
much
ado
i
did
get
to
bed
to
my
lord
middlesex
lionel
third
and
last
earl
of
middlesex
ob
in
the
great
cabbin

i
was
cruelly
troubled
before
i
could
dispose
of
him
and
quit
myself
of
him
so
to
my
cabbin
again
where
the
company
still
was
and
were
talking
more
of
the
king
difficulties
as
how
he
was
fain
to
eat
a
piece
of
bread
and
cheese
out
of
a
poor
body
pocket
how
at
a
catholique
house
he
was
fain
to
lie
in
the
priest
hole
a
good
while
in
the
house
for
his
privacy
after
that
our
company
broke
up

all
the

many
merry
stories
at
supper
the
three
drs
of
physique
again
at
my
cabbin
where
i
put
scarborough
in
mind
of
what
i
heard
him
say
that
children
do
in
every
day
experience
look
several
ways
with
both
their
eyes
till
custom
teaches
them
otherwise
and
that
we
do
now
see
but
with
one
eye
our
eyes
looking
in
parallel
lynes
after
this
discourse
i
was
called
to
write
a
pass
for
my
lord
mandeville
eldest
son
of
the
earl
of
manchester
to
take
up
horses
to
london
which
i
wrote
in
the
king
name
and
carried
it
to
him
to
sign
which
was
the
first
and
only
one
that
ever
he
signed
in
the
ship
charles
to
bed
coming
in
sight
of
land
a
little
before
night
by
the
morning
we
were
come
close
to
the
land
and
everybody
made
ready
to
get
on
shore
the
king
and
the
two
dukes
did
eat
their
breakfast
before
they
went
and
there
being
set
some
ship
diet
they
eat
nothing
else
but
pease
and
pork
and
boiled
beef
clerke
who
eat
with
me
told
me
how
the
king
had
given
to
shepley
for
my
lord
servants
and
among
the
officers
and
common
men
of
the
ship
i
spoke
to
the
duke
of
york
about
business
who
called
me
pepys
by
name
and
upon
my
desire
did
promise
me
his
future
favour
great
expectation
of
the
king
making
some
knights
but
there
was
none
about
noon
though
the
brigantine
that
beale
made
was
there
ready
to
carry
him
yet
he
would
go
in
my
lord
barge
with
the
two
dukes
our
captn
steered
and
my
lord
went
along
bare
with
him
i
went
and
mansell
and
one
of
the
footmen
and
a
dog
that
the
king
loved
in
a
boat
by
ourselves
and
so
got
on
shore
when
the
king
did
who
was
received
by
general
monk
with
all
imaginable
love
and
respect
at
his
entrance
upon
the
land
of

infinite
the
crowd
of

sorts

come
and
gave
him
his

badge
of
his
place

the

did
give
him
again
the
mayor
also
presented
him
from
the
town
a
very
rich
bible
which
he
took
and
said
it
was
the
thing
that
he
loved
above
all
things
in
the
world
a
canopy
was
provided
for
him
to
stand
under
which
he
did
and
talked
awhile
with
general
monk
and
others
and
so
into
a
stately
coach
there
set
for
him
and
so
away
through
the
towne
towards
canterbury
without
making
any
stay
at
dover
the
shouting
and
joy
expressed
by
all
is
past
imagination
seeing
that
my
lord
did
not
stir
out
of
his
barge
i
got
into
a
boat
and
so
into
his
barge
my
lord
almost
transported
with
joy
that
he
had
done
all
this
without
any
the
least
blur
or
obstruction
in
the
world
that
could
give
offence
to
any
and
with
the
great
honour
he
thought
it
would
be
to
him
being
overtook
by
the
brigantine
my
lord
and
we
went
out
of
our
barge
into

now
done
as
is
to
be
seen
my
lord
dined
with
the
who
is
as
officious
poor
man
as
any
spaniel
can
be
but
i
believe
all
to
no
purpose
for
i
believe

his
place

me
of
himself
saying
that

was
very
true
on
shore
we
took
horses
my
lord
and
hetly
and
i
and
three
or
four
servants
and
had
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
in
riding
at
last
we
came
upon
a
very
high
cliffe
by
the
and
rode
under
it
we
having
laid
great
wagers
i
and
mathews
that
it
was
not
so
high
as
paul
my
lord
and
hetly
that
it
was
but
we
riding
under
it
my
lord
made
a
pretty
good
measure
of
it
with
two
sticks
and
found
it
to
be
not
yards
high
and
paul
is
reckoned
to
be
about
ninety
from
thence
toward
the
barge
again
and
in
our
way
found
the
people
of
deale
going
to
make
a
bonfire
for
joy
of
the
day
it
being
the
king
birthday
and
had
some
guns
which
they
did
fire
at
my
lord
coming
by
for
which
i
did
give
twenty
shillings
among
them
to
drink
while
we
were
on
the
top
of
the
cliffe
we
saw
and
heard
our
guns
in
the
fleet
go
off
for
the
same
joy
and
it
being
a
pretty
fair
day
we
could
see
above
twenty
miles
into
france
being
returned
on
board
my
lord
called
for
shepley
book
of
paul
by
which
we
were
confirmed
in
our
wager
this
day

is
thought

a

if

which

from

all
the

with

computing
how
much
the
thirty
ships
that

the
charles

i
wish
we

to

i
bless

execute
in
case
he
could
not
get
a
better
employment
for
me
at

not
remove
me

my

pulled
down
by

at

i
met
with

tell

that

was
a
sickly
man

all
the

and
by

to
white

with

where
after
we
had
talked
with
my
lord
i
went
to
the
privy
seale
and
got
my
bill
perfected
there
and
at
the
signet
and
then
to
the
house
of
lords
and

up
and
down
and
the
six
clerks
office
but
could
find
none
that
could
write
the
hand
that

so
in
despair
went

first
time

my
lord
montagu
my
lord

up
early
the
first
day

i
put
on
my
black
camlett
coat
with
silver
buttons
to
spong
whom
i
found
in
his
writing
of
my
patent
it
being
done
we
carried
it
to
worcester
house
the
earls
of
worcester
had
a
large
house
between
durham
place
and
the
savoy
which
lord
clarendon
rented
at
per
annum
while
his
own
was
building
to
the
chancellor
where
kipps
got
me
the
chancellor
recepi
to
my
bill
and
so
carried
it
to
beale
for
a
dockett
but
he
was
very
angry
and
unwilling
to
do
it
because
he
said
it
was
ill
writ
because
i
had
got
it
writ
by
another
hand
and
not
by
him
but
by
much
importunity
i
got
spong
to
go
to
his
office
and
make
an
end
of
my
patent
and
in
the
mean
time
beale
to
be
preparing
my
dockett
which
being
done
i
did
give
him
two
pieces
after
which
it
was
strange
how
civil
and
tractable
he
was
to
me
met
with
spong
who
still
would
be
giving
me
council
of
getting
my
patent
out
for
fear
of
another
change
and
my
lord
montagu
fall
after
that
to
worcester
house
where
by
kipps
means
and
my
pressing
in
general

to
the
chancellor
i
did
beyond
all
expectation
get
my
seal
passed
and
while
it
was
doing
in
one
room
i
was
forced
to
keep
sir

me
there
ignorant
of
my
business
in
talk

to
my
lord

good
sermon
upon

much
is
given
of
him
much
is
required
he
was
very
officious
with
his
three
reverences

with

method

in
defending
of
the
army
and
the
navy
promising
the
parliament
to
save
them
a
great
deal
of
money
when
we
judge
that
it
will
cost
the
king
more
than
if
they
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
by
reason
of
their
delayes

that

that

that
the
thing
is
very
bad
for
the
duke
and
them
all
but
my
lord
do
make
light
of
it
as
a
thing
that
he
believes

thing
for

abroad
after

afterward
together
to

where
i
went

peters
the

were
this
day
arraigned
at
the
bar
of
the
sessions
house
there
being
upon
the
bench
the
lord
mayor
general
monk
my
lord
of
sandwich
such
a
bench
of
noblemen
as
had
not
been
ever
seen
in

they
all
seem
to
be
dismayed
and
will
all
be
condemned
without
question

exchequer
chief
justice
of
the
common
pleas
and
lord
keeper
of
the
great
seal
and
was
created
a
baronet
he
did
wholly
rip
up
the
unjustnesse
of
the
war
against
the
king
from
the
beginning
and
so
it
much
reflects
upon
all
the
long
parliament
though
the
king
had
pardoned
them
yet
they
must
hereby
confess
that
the
king
do
look
upon
them
as
traytors
they
are
to
plead
what
they
have
to
say
to
walk
in
james
park
where
we
observed
the
several
engines
at
work
to
draw
up
water
with
which
sight
i
was
very
much
pleased
above
all
the
rest
i
liked
that
which
greatorex
a
mathematical
instrument
maker
brought
which
do
carry
up
the
water
with
a
great
deal
of
ease
here
in
the
park
me
met
with
salisbury
who
took
creed
and
me
to
the
cockpitt
to
see
the
moore
of
venice
which
was
well
done
burt
acted
the
moore
burt
ranked
in
the
list
of
good
actors
after
the
restoration
though
he
resigned
the
part
of
othello
to
hart
davis
dramatic
misc
by
the
same
token
a
very
pretty
lady
that
sat
by
me
called
out
to
see
desdemona
smothered
i
went
out
to
charing
cross
to
see
harrison
hanged
drawn
and
quartered
which
was
done
there
he
looking
as
cheerful
as
any
man
could
do
in
that
condition
thomas

of
a
butcher
at
appointed
by
cromwell
to
convey
charles

order
to
his
trial
and
afterwards
sat
as
one
of
his
judges
he
was
presently
cut
down
and
his
head
and
heart
shown
to
the
people
at
which
there
was
great
shouts
of
joy
it
is
said
that
he
said
that
he
was
sure
to
come
shortly
at
the
right
hand
of
christ
to
judge
them
that
now
had
judged
him
and
that
his
wife
do
expect
his
coming
again
thus
it
was
my
chance
to
see
the
king
beheaded
at
white
hall
and
to
see
the
first
blood
shed
in
revenge
for
the
king
at
charing
cross
to
white
hall
chappell
where
one
crofts
made
an
indifferent
sermon
and
after
it
an
anthem
ill
sung
which
made
the
king
laugh
here
i
first
did
see
the
princesse
royall
since
she
came
into
england
here
i
also
observed
how
the
duke
of
york
and
palmer
did
talk
to
one
another
very
wantonly
through
the
hangings
that
parts
the
king
closet
and
the
closet
where
the
ladies
sit
this
morning

carew
one
of
the
regicides
being
come
home
will
told
me
that
my
lord
had
a
mind
to
speak
with
me
so
i
returned
by
water
and
coming
there
it
was
only
to
enquire
how
the
ships
were
provided
with
victuals
that
are
to
go
with
him
to
fetch
over
the
queen
which
i
gave
him
a
good
account
of
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
melancholy
humour
which
i
was
told
by
howe
was
for
that
he
had
lately
lost
a
great
deal
of
money
at
cards
which
he
fears
he
do
too
much
addict
himself
to
this
morning
it
being
expected
that
colonel
hacker
and
axtell
should
die
i
went
to
newgate
but
found
they
were
reprieved
till
francis
hacker
commanded
the
guards
at
the
king

guarded
the
high
court
of

my
accounts

my
lord

dined
with
my
lord

very
high

he
would
have
a
french
cooke
and
a
master
of
his
horse
and
his
lady
and
child
to
wear
black
patches
which
methought
was
strange
but
he
is
become
a
perfect
courtier
and
among
other
things
my
lady
saying
that
she
could
get
a
good
merchant
for
her
daughter
he
answered
that
he
would
rather
see
her
with
a
pedlar
pack
at
her
back
so
she
married
a
gentleman
than
she
should
marry
a
citizen
this
afternoon

ladies
and
we
were
very
civilly
treated
and
had
a
very
good
place
to
see
the
pageants
which
were
many
and
i
believe
good
for
such
kind
of
things
but
in
themselves

hear
nothing
yet
of
my
lord
whether
he

gone
for
the

is
now
upon
coming
back

november
this
morning
sir
pen
and
i
were
mounted
early

very
merry

the
way
he

very
good
company
we

where
he
lives
like
a
prince
and
we
were
made
very
welcome
among
other
things
he
showed
me
my
lady
closet
wherein
was
great
store
of
rarities
as
also
a
chair
which
he
calls
king
harry
chaire
where
he
that
sits
down
is
catched
with
two
irons
that
come
round
about
him
which
makes
good
sport
here
dined
with
us
two
or
three
more
country
gentlemen
among
the
rest
christmas
my
old
with
whom
i
had
much
talk
he
did
remember
that
i
was
a
great
roundhead
when
i
was
a
boy
and
i
was
much
afraid
that
he
would
have
remembered
the
words
that
i
said
the
day
the
king
was
beheaded
that
were
i
to
preach
upon
him
my
text
should
be
the
memory
of
the
wicked
shall
rot
but
i
found
afterwards
that
he
did
go
away
from
school
before
that
time
to
white
hall
where
i
saw
the
boats
coming
very
thick
to
lambeth
and
all
the
stairs
to
be
full
of
people
i
was
told
the
queen
was
so
i
got
a
sculler
for
sixpence
to
carry
me
thither
and
back
again
but
i
could
not
get
to
see
the
queen
so
come
back
and
to
my
lord
where
he
was
come
and
i
supt
with
him
he
being
very
merry
telling
me
stories
of
the
country
mayors
how
they
entertained
the
king
all
the
way
as
he
come
along
and
how
the
country
gentlewomen
did
hold
up
their
heads
to
be
kissed
by
the
king
not
taking
his
hand
to
kiss
as
they
should
do
i
took
leave
of
my
lord
and
lady
and
so
took
coach
at
white
hall
and
carried
childe
as
far
as
the
strand
and
myself
got
as
far
as
ludgate
by
all
the
bonfires
but
with
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
there
the
coachman
desired
that
i
would
release
him
for
he
durst
not
go
further
for
the
fires
in
paul
churchyard
i
called
at
kirton
and
there
they
had
got
a
masse
book
for
me
which
i
bought
and
cost
me
twelve
shillings
and
when
i
come
home
sat
up
late
and
read
in
it
with
great
pleasure
to
my
wife
to
hear
that
she
was
long
ago
acquainted
with
it
i
observed
this
night
very
few
bonfires
in
the
city
not
above
three
in
all
london
for
the
queen
coming
whereby
i
guess
that
as
i
believed
before
her
coming
do
please
but
very
few
saturday
in
the
afternoon
to
white
hall
where
my
lord
and
lady
were
gone
to
kiss
the
queen
hand
lord
day
in
the
morn
to
our
own
church
where
mills
did
begin
to
nibble
at
the
common
prayer
by
saying
glory
be
to
the
father
after
he
had
read
the
two
psalms
but
the
people
had
been
so
little
used
to
it
that
they
could
not
tell
what
to
answer
daniel
milles
years
rector
of
olave
and
buried
there
october
aged
in
sir
robert
brooks
presented
him
to
the
rectory
of
wanstead
which
he
also
held
till
his
death
this
declaration
of
the
king
do
give
the
presbyterians
some
satisfaction
and
a
pretence
to
read
the
common
prayer
which
they
would
not
do
before
because
of
their
former
preaching
against
it
after
dinner
to
westminster
where
i
went
to
my
lord
and
having
spoken
with
him
i
went
to
the
abbey
where
the
first
time
that
ever
i
heard
the
organs
in
a
cathedral
my
wife
seemed
very
pretty
it
being
the
first
time
i
had
given
her
leave
to
weare
a
black
patch
at
the
office
at
night
to
make
up
an
account
of
what
the
debts
of
nineteen
of
the
ships
that
should
have
been
paid
off
is
increased
since
the
adjournment
of
the
parliament
they
being
to
sit
again
this
day
of
november
is
observed
exceeding
well
in
the
city
and
at
night
great
bonfires
and
fireworks
chetwind
told
me
that
he
did
fear
that
this
late
business
of
the
duke
of
york
would
prove
fatal
to
my
lord
chancellor
to
our
office
where
we
met
all
for
the
sale
of
two
ships
by
an
inch
of
candle
the
first
time
that
ever
i
saw
any
of
this
kind
where
i
observed
how
they
do
invite
one
another
and
at
last
how
they
all
do
cry
and
we
have
much
to
do
to
tell
who
did
cry
last
the
ships
were
the
indian
sold
for
and
the
sold
for
went
by
water
to
my
lord
where
i
dined
with
him
and
he
in
a
very
merry
humour
present
borfett
and
childe
at
dinner
he
in
discourse
of
the
great
opinion
of
the
virtue
gratitude
which
he
did
account
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
to
him
and
had
therefore
in
his
mind
been
often
troubled
in
the
late
times
how
to
answer
his
gratitude
to
the
king
who
raised
his
father
did
say
it
was
that
did
bring
him
to
his
obedience
to
the
king
and
did
also
bless
himself
with
his
good
fortune
in
comparison
to
what
it
was
when
i
was
with
him
in
the
sound
when
he
durst
not
own
his
correspondence
with
the
king
which
is
a
thing
that
i
never
did
hear
of
to
this
day
before
and
i
do
from
this
raise
an
opinion
of
him
to
be
one
of
the
most
secret
men
in
the
world
which
i
was
not
so
convinced
of
before
after
dinner
he
bid
all
go
out
of
the
room
and
did
tell
me
how
the
king
had
promised
him
per
annum
for
ever
and
had
already
given
him
a
bill
under
his
hand
which
he
showed
me
for
that
fox
is
to
pay
him
my
lord
did
advise
with
me
how
to
get
this
received
and
to
put
out
into
safe
hands
at
use
and
the
other
he
will
make
use
for
his
present
occasion
this
he
did
advise
with
me
about
with
great
secresy
after
this
he
called
for
the
fiddles
and
books
and
we
two
and
howe
and
childe
did
sing
and
play
some
psalmes
of
will
lawes
and
some
songs
and
so
i
went
away
brother
to
henry
lawes
the
celebrated
composer
and
himself
a
chamber
musician
to
charles
in
whose
service
he
took
up
arms
and
was
killed
at
the
siege
of
chester
the
king
regretted
his
loss
severely
and
used
to
call
him
the
father
of
music
notwithstanding
this
was
the
first
day
of
the
proclamation
against
hackney
coaches
coming
into
the
streets
to
stand
to
be
hired
yet
i
got
one
to
carry
me
home
the
comtroller
sir
r
slingsby
and
i
to
the
house
where
he
showed
me
the
state
of
his
case
how
the
king
did
owe
him
above
but
i
do
not
see
great
likelihood
for
them
to
be
paid
since
they
begin
already
in
parliament
to
dispute
the
paying
off
the
just
which
were
already
promised
to
be
paid
and
will
be
the
undoing
of
thousands
if
they
be
not
paid
my
lord
did
this
day
show
me
the
king
picture
which
was
done
in
flanders
that
the
king
did
promise
my
lord
before
he
ever
saw
him
and
that
we
did
expect
to
have
had
at
sea
before
the
king
come
to
us
but
it
come
but
and
indeed
it
is
the
most
pleasant
and
the
most
like
him
that
ever
i
saw
picture
in
my
life
to
sir
batten
to
dinner
he
having
a
couple
of
servants
married
and
so
there
was
a
great
number
of
merchants
and
others
of
good
quality
on
purpose
after
dinner
to
make
an
offering
which
when
dinner
was
done
we
did
and
i
did
give
ten
shillings
and
no
more
though
i
believe
most
of
the
rest
did
give
more
and
did
believe
that
i
did
so
too
i
went
with
the
treasurer
in
his
coach
to
white
hall
and
in
our
way
in
discourse
do
find
him
a
very
man
and
talking
of
those
men
who
now
stand
condemned
for
murdering
the
king
he
says
that
he
believes
that
if
the
law
would
give
leave
the
king
is
a
man
of
so
great
compassion
that
he
would
wholly
acquit
them
shepley
and
i
to
the
new
near
which
was
formerly
gibbon
where
the
play
of
beggar
bush
the
beggar
bush
a
comedy
by
beaumont
and
fletcher
was
newly
begun
and
so
we
went
in
and
saw
it
well
acted
and
here
i
saw
the
first
time
one
moone
who
is
said
to
be
the
best
actor
in
the
world
lately
come
over
with
the
king
and
indeed
it
is
the
finest
i
believe
that
ever
was
in
england
mohun
or
moone
the
celebrated
actor
who
had
borne
a
major
commission
in
the
king
army
the
period
of
his
death
is
uncertain
this
morning
i
found
my
lord
in
bed
late
he
having
been
with
the
king
queen
and
princesse
at
the
cockpit
all
night
where
general
monk
treated
them
and
after
supper
a
play
where
the
king
did
put
a
great
affront
upon
singleton
musique
he
bidding
them
stop
and
made
the
french
musique
play
which
my
lord
says
do
much
outdo
all
ours
this
morning
come
the
carpenters
to
make
me
a
door
at
the
other
side
of
my
house
going
into
the
entry
to
fox
where
we
found
fox
within
and
an
alderman
of
london
paying
or
in
gold
upon
the
table
for
the
king
elizabeth
daughter
of
william
whittle
of
lancashire
wife
of
stephen
fox
who
was
knighted
in
fox
come
in
presently
and
did
receive
us
with
a
great
deal
of
respect
and
then
did
take
my
wife
and
i
to
the
queen
where
he
got
my
wife
placed
behind
the
queen
chaire
and
the
two
princesses
come
to
dinner
the
queen
a
very
little
plain
old
woman
and
nothing
more
in
her
presence
in
any
respect
nor
garbe
than
any
ordinary
woman
the
princesse
of
orange
i
had
often
seen
before
the
princesse
henrietta
is
very
pretty
but
much
below
my
expectation
and
her
dressing
of
herself
with
her
haire
frized
short
up
to
her
eares
did
make
her
seem
so
much
the
less
to
me
but
my
wife
standing
near
her
with
two
or
three
black
patches
on
and
well
dressed
did
seem
to
me
much
handsomer
than
she
to
white
hall
at
about
nine
at
night
and
there
with
laud
the
page
that
went
with
me
we
could
not
get
out
of
henry
the
eighth
gallery
into
the
further
part
of
the
boarded
gallery
where
my
lord
was
walking
with
my
lord
ormond
and
we
had
a
key
of
sir
morland
but
all
would
not
do
till
at
last
by
knocking
harrison
the
did
open
us
the
door
and
after
some
talk
with
my
lord
about
getting
a
catch
to
carry
my
lord
alban
goods
to
france
i
parted
and
went
home
on
foot
henry
jermyn
created
lord
jermyn
advanced
to
the
earldom
of
alban
ob
he
was
supposed
to
be
married
to
the
queen
dowager
i
had
a
letter
brought
me
from
my
lord
to
get
a
ship
ready
to
carry
the
queen
things
over
to
france
she
being
to
go
within
five
or
six
days
to
westminster
hall
and
in
king
street
there
being
a
great
stop
of
coaches
there
was
a
falling
out
between
a
drayman
and
my
lord
chesterfield
coachman
and
one
of
his
footmen
killed
moore
told
me
how
the
house
had
this
day
voted
the
king
to
have
all
the
excise
for
ever
this
day
i
do
also
hear
that
the
queen
going
to
france
is
stopt
which
do
like
me
well
because
then
the
king
will
be
in
town
the
next
month
which
is
my
month
again
at
the
privy
seale
sir
carteret
did
give
us
an
account
how
holland
do
intend
to
prevail
with
the
parliament
to
try
his
project
of
discharging
the
seamen
all
at
present
by
ticket
and
so
promise
interest
to
all
men
that
will
lend
money
upon
them
at
eight
per
for
so
long
as
they
are
unpaid
whereby
he
do
think
to
take
away
the
growing
debt
which
do
now
lie
upon
the
kingdom
for
lack
of
present
money
to
discharge
the
seamen
december
this
day
the
parliament
voted
that
the
bodies
of
oliver
ireton
bradshaw
should
be
taken
up
out
of
their
graves
in
the
abbey
and
drawn
to
the
gallows
and
there
hanged
and
buried
under
it
which
methinks
do
trouble
me
that
a
man
of
so
great
courage
as
he
was
should
have
that
dishonour
though
otherwise
he
might
deserve
it
enough
i
went
to
the
duke
and
first
calling
upon
coventry
at
his
chamber
i
went
to
the
duke
who
had
sat
up
late
last
night
and
lay
long
this
morning
this
being
done
i
went
to
chapel
and
sat
in
blagrave
pew
and
there
did
sing
my
part
along
with
another
before
the
king
and
with
much
ease
it
is
expected
that
the
duke
will
marry
the
lord
chancellor
daughter
at
last
which
is
likely
to
be
the
ruine
of
davis
and
my
lord
barkley
who
have
carried
themselves
so
high
against
the
chancellor
sir
chas
barkley
swearing
that
he
and
others
had
intrigued
with
her
often
which
all
believe
to
be
a
lie
in
the
afternoon
i
went
to
white
hall
where
i
was
surprised
with
the
news
of
a
plot
against
the
king
person
and
my
lord
monk
and
that
since
last
night
there
were
about
forty
taken
up
on
suspicion
and
amongst
others
it
was
my
lot
to
meet
with
simon
beale
the
trumpeter
who
took
me
and
tom
doling
into
the
guard
in
scotland
yard
and
showed
us
overton
one
of
oliver
cromwell
a
high
republican
here
i
heard
him
deny
that
he
is
guilty
of
any
such
things
but
that
whereas
it
is
said
that
he
is
found
to
have
brought
many
armes
to
towne
he
says
it
is
only
to
sell
them
as
he
will
prove
by
oath
they
told
me
that
this
is
thomas
and
that
by
an
old
custome
this
day
the
exchequer
men
had
formerly
and
do
intend
this
night
to
have
a
supper
which
if
i
could
i
promised
to
come
to
but
did
not

my
lady

dined
with
her

told
me
how
dangerously
ill
the
princesse

that
she
hath
married
herself
to
young
jermyn
henry
jermyn
master
of
the
horse
to
the
duke
of
york
which
is
worse
than
the
duke
of
york

the
chancellor
daughter
which
is
now
publicly
owned
to
white
hall
by
water
and
dined
with

and
so
went
to
the
new
theatre
and
saw
it
acted
but
my
expectation
being
too
great
it
did
not
please
me
as
otherwise
i
believe
it
would
and
my
having
a
book
i
believe
did
spoil
it
a
little
that
being
done
i
went
to
my
lord
where
i
found
him
private
at
cards
with
my
lord
lauderdale
and
some
persons
of
honour
at
the
end
of
the
last
and
the
beginning
of
this
year
i
do
live
in
one
of
the
houses
belonging
to
the
navy
office
as
one
of
the
principal

and
have
done

my
girl

myself
in
constant
good
health
and
in
a
most
handsome
and
thriving
condition
blessed
be
almighty
god
for
it
as
to
things
of
the
king
settled
and
loved
of
all
the
duke
of
york
matched
to
my
lord
daughter
which
do
not
please
many
the
queen
upon
her
returne
to
france
with
the
princesse
henrietta
youngest
daughter
of
charles
married
soon
after
to
philip

died
suddenly
in
not
without
suspicion
of
having
been
poisoned
the
princesse
of
orange
lately
dead
and
we
into
new
mourning
for
her
we
have
been
lately
frighted
with
a
great
plot
and
many
taken
up
on
it
and
the
fright
not
quite
over
the
parliament
which
had
done
all
this
great
good
to
the
king
beginning
to
grow
factious
the
king
did
dissolve
it
december
last
and
another
likely
to
be
chosen
speedily
january
moore
and
i
went
to
pierce
in
our
way
seeing
the
duke
of
york
bring
his
lady
to
wait
upon
the
queen
the
first
time
that
ever
she
did
since
that
business
and
the
queen
is
said
to
receive
her
now
with
much
respect
and
love
my
lord
did
give
me
many
commands
in
his
business
as
to
write
to
my
uncle
that
barnewell
papers
should
be
locked
up
in
case
he
should
die
he
being
now
suspected
to
be
very
also
about
consulting
with
montagu
william
third
son
to
lord
montagu
of
boughton
afterwards
to
the
queen
and
made
chief

also
about

this
next
parliament

to

with
much
company
and
i
with

where
we
took
water
for
lambeth
and
there
coach
for
portsmouth
the
queen
things
were
all
in
white
hall
court
ready
to
be
sent
away
and
her
majesty
ready
to
be
gone
an
hour
after
to
hampton
court
to
night
and
so
to
be
at
portsmouth
on
saturday
next
this
day
i
left
sir
batten
and
captn
rider
my
chine
of
beefe
for
to
serve
at
trinity
house
the
duke
of
albemarle
being
to
be
there
and
all
the
rest
of
the
brethren
it
being
a
great
day
for
the
reading
over
of
their
new
charter
which
the
king
hath
newly
given
them
to
the
theatre
where
was
acted
beggars
bush
it
being
very
well
done
and
here
the
first
time
that
ever
i
saw
women
come
upon
the
stage
i
had
been
early
this
morning
at
white
hall
at
the
jewell
office
to
choose
a
piece
of
gilt
plate
for
my
lord
in
returne
of
his
offering
to
the
king
which
it
seems
is
usual
at
this
time
of
year
and
an
earle
gives
twenty
pieces
in
gold
in
a
purse
to
the
king
i
chose
a
gilt
tankard
weighing
ounces
and
a
half
and
he
is
allowed
so
i
paid
for
the
ounce
and
half
over
what
he
is
to
have
but
strange
it
was
for
me
to
see
what
a
company
of
small
fees
i
was
called
upon
by
a
great
many
to
pay
there
which
i
perceive
is
the
manner
that
courtiers
do
get
their
estates
this
morning
news
was
brought
to
me
to
my
that
there
had
been
a
great
stir
in
the
city
this
night
by
the
fanatiques
who
had
been
up
and
killed
six
or
seven
men
but
all
are
fled
my
lord
mayor
and
the
whole
city
had
been
in
armes
above
tom
and
i
and
my
wife
to
the
theatre
and
there
saw
the
silent
woman
among
other
things
here
kinaston
the
boy
had
the
good
turn
to
appear
in
three
shapes
first
as
a
poor
woman
in
ordinary
clothes
to
please
morose
then
in
fine
clothes
as
a
gallant
and
in
them
was
clearly
the
prettiest
woman
in
the
whole
house
and
lastly
as
a
man
and
then
likewise
did
appear
the
handsomest
man
in
the
house
in
our
way
home
we
were
in
many
places
strictly
examined
more
than
in
the
worst
of
times
there
being
great
fears
of
the
fanatiques
rising
again
for
the
present
i
do
not
hear
that
any
of
them
are
taken
some
talk
of
a
head
of
fanatiques
that
do
appear
about
but
i
do
not
believe
it
however
my
lord
mayor
sir
richd
browne
hath
carried
himself
honourably
and
hath
caused
one
of
their
in
london
to
be
pulled
down
waked
in
the
morning
about
six
by
people
running
up
and
down
in
davis
house
talking
that
the
fanatiques
were
up
in
armes
in
the
city
and
so
i
rose
and
went
forth
where
in
the
street
i
found
every
body
in
armes
at
the
doors
so
i
returned
and
got
my
sword
and
pistol
which
however
i
had
no
powder
to
charge
and
went
to
the
door
where
i
found
sir
ford
lord
mayor
of
london
and
with
him
i
walked
up
and
down
as
far
as
the
exchange
and
there
i
left
him
in
our
way
the
streets
full
of
and
great
stir
what
mischief
these
rogues
have
done
and
i
think
near
a
dozen
had
been
killed
this
morning
on
both
sides
the
shops
shut
and
all
things
in
trouble
after
dinner
will
comes
to
tell
me
that
he
had
presented
my
piece
of
plate
to
coventry
who
takes
it
very
kindly
and
sends
me
a
very
kind
letter
and
the
plate
back
again
of
which
my
heart
is
very
glad
davis
told
us
the
particular
examinations
of
these
fanatiques
that
are
taken
and
in
short
it
is
this
these
fanatiques
that
have
routed
all
the
that
they
met
with
put
the
king
to
the
run
killed
about
twenty
men
broke
through
the
city
gates
twice
and
all
this
in
the
when
all
the
city
was
in
armes
are
not
in
all
above
whereas
we
did
believe
them
because
they
were
seen
up
and
down
in
every
place
almost
in
the
city
and
had
been
in
highgate
two
or
three
days
and
in
several
other
places
to
be
at
least
a
thing
that
never
was
heard
of
that
so
few
men
should
dare
and
do
so
much
mischief
their
word
was
the
king
jesus
and
their
heads
upon
the
gates
few
of
them
would
receive
any
quarter
but
such
as
were
taken
by
force
and
kept
alive
expecting
jesus
to
come
here
and
reign
in
the
world
presently
and
will
not
believe
yet
the
king
this
day
come
to
towne
office
day
this
day
comes
news
by
letters
from
portsmouth
that
the
princesse
henrietta
is
fallen
sick
of
the
measles
on
board
the
london
after
the
queen
and
she
was
under
sail
and
so
was
forced
to
come
back
again
into
portsmouth
harbour
and
in
their
way
by
negligence
of
the
pilot
run
upon
the
horse
sand
the
queen
and
she
continue
aboard
and
do
not
intend
to
come
on
shore
till
she
sees
what
will
become
of
the
young
princesse
this
newes
do
make
people
think
something
indeed
that
three
of
the
royal
family
should
fall
sick
of
the
same
disease
one
after
another
this
morning
likewise
we
had
order
to
see
guards
set
in
all
the
king
yards
and
so
sir
wm
batten
goes
to
chatham
colonel
slingsby
and
i
to
deptford
and
woolwich
portsmouth
being
a
garrison
needs
none
we
fell
to
choosing
four
captains
to
command
the
guards
and
choosing
the
place
where
to
keep
them
and
other
things
in
order
thereunto
never
till
now
did
i
see
the
great
authority
of
my
place
all
the
captains
of
the
fleete
coming
cap
in
hand
to
us
after
sermon
to
deptford
again
where
at
the
commissioner
and
the
globe
we
staid
long
but
no
sooner
in
bed
but
we
had
an
alarme
and
so
we
rose
and
the
comptroller
comes
into
the
yard
to
us
and
seamen
of
all
the
ships
present
repair
to
us
and
there
are
armed
with
every
one
a
handspike
with
which
they
were
as
fierce
as
could
be
at
last
we
hear
that
it
was
five
or
six
men
that
did
ride
through
the
guard
in
the
towne
without
stopping
to
the
guard
that
was
there
and
some
say
shot
at
them
but
all
being
quiet
there
we
caused
the
seamen
to
go
on
board
again
this
day
i
hear
the
princesse
is
recovered
again
the
king
hath
been
this
afternoon
at
deptford
to
see
the
yacht
that
commissioner
pett
is
building
which
will
be
very
pretty
as
also
that
his
brother
at
woolwich
is
making
to
the
comptroller
and
with
him
by
coach
to
white
hall
in
our
way
meeting
venner
and
pritchard
upon
a
sledge
who
with
two
more
fifth
monarchy
men
were
hanged
and
the
two
first
drawn
and
quartered
thomas
venner
a
cooper
and
preacher
to
a
conventicle
in
he
was
a
violent
enthusiast
and
leader
in
the
insurrection
on
the
of
january
before
mentioned
he
was
much
wounded
before
he
could
be
taken
and
fought
with
courage
amounting
to
desperation
it
is
strange
what
weather
we
have
had
all
this
winter
no
cold
at
all
but
the
ways
are
dusty
and
the
flyes
fly
up
and
down
and
the
are
full
of
leaves
such
a
time
of
the
year
as
was
never
known
is
this
world
before
here
this
day
many
more
of
the
fifth
monarchy
men
were
hanged
i
met
with
thos
fuller
he
tells
me
of
his
last
and
great
book
that
is
coming
out
that
is
the
history
of
all
the
families
in
england
and
could
tell
me
more
of
my
owne
than
i
knew
myself
and
also
to
what
perfection
he
hath
now
brought
the
art
of
memory
that
he
did
lately
to
four
eminently
great
scholars
dictate
together
is
latin
upon
different
subjects
of
their
proposing
faster
than
they
were
able
to
write
till
they
were
tired
and
that
the
best
way
of
beginning
a
sentence
if
a
man
should
be
out
and
forget
his
last
sentence
which
he
never
was
that
then
his
last
refuge
is
to
begin
with
an
utcunque
lord
day
before
i
rose

to
me
from
portsmouth

wonder
to
have

with
two
of
his
countrymen
more
did
last
night
kill
one
soldier
of
four
that
quarrelled
with

street
about
ten
eldest
son
of
afterwards
lord

whom
he
succeeded
in
that
title
the
other
two
are
taken
but
he
is
now
hid
at
my
lord
till
night
that
he
do
intend
to
make
his
escape
away
into
the
hall
and
there
saw
my
lord
treasurer
earl
of
southampton
who
was
sworn
at
the
exchequer
with
a
great
company
of
lords
and
persons
of
honour

and
after
a
walk
to
my
lord
where
while
i
and
my
lady
were
in
her
chamber
in
talk
in
comes
my
lord
from
sea
to
our
great
wonder
he
had
dined
at
havre
de
grace
on
monday
last
and
come
to
the
downes
the
next
day
and
lay
at
canterbury
that
night
and
so
to
dartford
and
thence
this
morning
to
white
hall
among
others
creed
and
captn
ferrers
tell
me
the
stories
of
my
lord
duke
of
buckingham
and
my
lord
falling
out
at
havre
de
grace
at
cards
they
two
and
my
lord
alban
playing
the
duke
did
to
my
dishonour
often
say
that
he
did
in
his
conscience
know
the
contrary
to
what
he
then
said
about
the
difference
at
cards
and
so
did
take
up
the
money
that
he
should
have
lost
to
my
lord
which
my
lord
resenting
said
nothing
then
but
that
he
doubted
not
but
there
were
ways
enough
to
get
his
money
of
him
so
they
parted
that
night
and
my
lord
sent
sir
stayner
the
next
morning
to
the
duke
to
know
whether
he
did
remember
what
he
said
last
night
and
whether
he
would
owne
it
with
his
sword
and
a
second
which
he
said
he
would
and
so
both
sides
agreed
but
my
lord
alban
and
the
queen
and
ambassador
montagu
did
lay
them
at
their
lodgings
till
the
difference
was
made
up
to
my
lord
honour
who
hath
got
great
reputation
thereby
captn
cuttle
and
curtis
and
mootham
and
i
went
to
the
fleece
taverne
to
drink
and
there
we
spent
till
four
telling
stories
of
algiers
and
the
manner
of
life
of
slaves
there
and
truly
captn
mootham
and
dawes
who
have
been
both
slaves
there
did
make
me
fully
acquainted
with
their
condition
there
as
how
they
eat
nothing
but
bread
and
water
at
their
redemption
they
pay
so
much
for
the
water
they
drink
at
the
public
fountaynes
during
their
being
slaves
how
they
are
beat
upon
the
soles
of
their
feet
and
bellies
at
the
liberty
of
their
padron
how
they
are
all
at
night
called
into
their
master
a
bagnard
and
there
they
lie
how
the
poorest
men
do
love
their
slaves
best
how
some
rogues
do
live
well
if
they
do
invent
to
bring
their
masters
in
so
much
a
week
by
their
industry
or
theft
and
then
they
are
put
to
no
other
work
at
all
and
theft
there
is
counted
no
great
crime
at
all
by
coach
to
the
theatre
and
there
saw
the
scornfull
lady
a
comedy
by
beaumont
and
fletcher
now
done
by
a
woman
which
makes
the
play
appear
much
better
than
ever
it
did
to
me
the
talk
of
the
towne
now
is
who
the
king
is
like
to
have
for
his
queene
and
whether
lent
shall
be
kept
with
the
strictnesse
of
the
king
proclamation
which
is
thought
can
not
be
because
of
the
poor
who
can
not
buy
fish
and
also
the
great
preparation
for
the
king
crowning
is
now
much
thought
upon
and
talked
of
it
is
much
talked
that
the
king
is
already
married
to
the
niece
of
the
prince
de
ligne
and
that
he
hath
two
sons
already
by
her
which
i
am
sorry
to
hear
but
yet
am
gladder
that
it
should
be
so
than
that
the
duke
of
york
and
his
family
should
come
to
the
crowne
he
being
a
professed
friend
to
the
catholiques
met
with
sir
carteret
who
afterwards
with
the
duke
of
york
my
lord
sandwich
and
others
went
into
a
private
room
to
consult
and
we
were
a
little
troubled
that
we
were
not
called
in
with
the
rest
but
i
do
believe
it
was
upon
something
very
private
we
staid
walking
in
the
gallery
where
we
met
with
slingsby
who
showed
me
the
stamps
of
the
king
new
coyne
which
is
strange
to
see
how
good
they
are
in
the
stamp
and
bad
in
the
money
for
lack
of
skill
to
make
them
but
he
says
blondeau
will
shortly
come
over
and
then
we
shall
have
it
better
and
the
best
in
the
world
he
tells
me
he
is
sure
that
the
king
is
not
yet
married
as
it
is
said
nor
that
it
is
known
who
he
will
have
my
wife
to
sir
batten
and
there
sat
a
while
he
having
yesterday
sent
my
wife
pair
of
gloves
and
a
pair
of
silk
stockings
and
garters
for
her
valentines
this
my
birthday
years
hartlett
told
me
how
my
lord
chancellor
had
lately
got
the
duke
of
york
and
duchesse
and
her
woman
my
lord
ossory
thomas
earl
of
ossory
son
of
the
duke
of
ormond
ob
aged
and
a
doctor
to
make
oath
before
most
of
the
judges
of
the
kingdom
concerning
all
the
circumstances
of
their
marriage
and
in
fine
it
is
confessed
that
they
were
not
fully
married
till
about
a
month
or
two
before
she
was
brought
to
bed
but
that
they
were
contracted
long
before
and
time
enough
for
the
child
to
be
legitimate
but
i
do
not
hear
that
it
was
put
to
the
judges
to
determine
whether
it
was
so
or
no
to
the
and
there
saw
the
changeling
the
changeling
a
tragedy
by
thomas
middleton
the
plot
is
taken
from
a
story
in
god
revenge
against
murder
the
first
time
it
hath
been
acted
these
twenty
years
and
it
takes
exceedingly
besides
i
see
the
gallants
do
begin
to
be
tyred
with
the
vanity
and
pride
of
the
theatre
actors
who
are
indeed
grown
very
proud
and
rich
i
also
met
with
the
comptroller
who
told
me
how
it
was
easy
for
us
all
the
principal
officers
and
proper
for
us
to
labour
to
get
into
the
next
parliament
and
would
have
me
to
ask
the
duke
letter
but
i
shall
not
endeavour
it
this
is
now
years
that
i
am
born
and
blessed
be
god
in
a
state
of
full
content
and
a
great
hope
to
be
a
happy
man
in
all
respects
both
to
myself
and
friends
i
called
for
a
dish
of
fish
which
we
had
for
dinner
this
being
the
first
day
of
lent
and
i
do
intend
to
try
whether
i
can
keep
it
or
no
notwithstanding
my
resolution
yea
for
want
of
other
victualls
i
did
eat
flesh
this
lent
but
am
resolved
to
eat
as
little
as
i
can
this
month
ends
with
two
great
secrets
under
dispute
but
yet
known
to
very
few
first
who
the
king
will
marry
and
what
the
meaning
of
this
fleet
is
which
we
are
now
sheathing
to
set
out
for
the
southward
most
think
against
algier
against
the
turke
or
to
the
east
indys
against
the
dutch
who
we
hear
are
setting
out
a
great
fleet
thither
march
after
dinner
shepley
and
i
in
private
talking
about
my
lord
intentions
to
go
speedily
into
the
country
but
to
what
end
we
know
not
we
fear
he
is
to
go
to
sea
with
his
fleet
now
preparing
but
we
wish
that
he
could
get
his
per
annum
settled
before
he
do
go
to
fryars
and
saw
the
bondman
acted
by
massinger
an
excellent
play
and
well
done
but
above
all
that
ever
i
saw
beterton
do
the
bondman
the
best
after
dinner
i
went
to
the
theatre
where
i
found
so
few
people
which
is
strange
and
the
reason
i
do
not
know
that
i
went
out
again
and
so
to
salsbury
court
where
the
house
as
full
as
could
be
and
it
seems
it
was
a
new
play
the
queen
maske
love
mistress
or
the
queen
masque
by
t
heywood
wherein
there
are
some
good
humours
among
others
a
good
jeer
to
the
old
story
of
the
siege
of
troy
making
it
to
be
a
common
country
tale
but
above
all
it
was
strange
to
see
so
little
a
boy
as
that
was
to
act
cupid
which
is
one
of
the
greatest
parts
in
it
my
lord
went
this
morning
on
his
journey
to
hinchingbroke
parker
with
him
the
chief
business
being
to
look
over
and
determine
how
and
in
what
manner
his
great
work
of
building
shall
be
done
before
his
going
he
did
give
me
some
jewells
to
keep
for
him
viz
that
that
the
king
of
sweden
did
give
him
with
the
king
own
picture
in
it
most
excellently
done
and
a
brave
george
all
of
diamonds
all
the
morning
at
the
office
at
noon
sir
batten
slingsby
and
i
by
coach
to
the
tower
to
sir
john
robinson
to
dinner
where
great
good
cheer
high
company
among
others
the
duchesse
of
albemarle
ann
clarges
daughter
of
a
blacksmith
and
bred
a
milliner
mistress
and
afterwards
wife
of
general
monk
over
whom
she
possessed
the
greatest
influence
who
is
ever
a
plain
homely
dowdy
after
dinner
to
drink
all
the
afternoon
towards
night
the
duchesse
and
ladies
went
away
then
we
set
to
it
again
till
it
was
very
late
and
at
last
come
in
sir
william
wale
almost
fuddled
and
because
i
was
set
between
him
and
another
only
to
keep
them
from
talking
and
spoiling
the
company
as
we
did
to
others
he
fell
out
with
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
but
with
much
ado
we
made
him
understand
his
error
and
then
all
quiet
to
my
lord
where
we
found
him
lately
come
from
hinchingbroke
i
staid
and
dined
with
him
he
took
me
aside
and
asked
me
what
the
world
spoke
of
the
king
marriage
which
i
answering
as
one
that
knew
nothing
he
enquired
no
further
of
me
but
i
do
perceive
by
it
that
there
is
something
in
it
that
is
ready
to
come
out
that
the
world
knows
not
of
yet
after
dinner
i
went
to
the
theatre
and
there
saw
mistress
done
by
them
which
i
do
not
like
in
some
things
as
well
as
their
acting
in
salsbury
court
this
day
my
wife
and
pall
went
to
see
my
lady
kingston
her
brother
lady
balthazar
michel
is
the
only
brother
of
pepys
mentioned
in
the
diary
this
day
an
ambassador
from
florence
was
brought
into
the
towne
in
state
yesterday
was
said
to
be
the
day
that
the
princesse
henrietta
was
to
marry
the
duke
in
france
this
day
i
found
in
the
that
roger
pepys
is
chosen
at
cambridge
for
the
towne
the
first
place
that
we
hear
of
to
have
made
their
choice
yet
to
white
hall
to
coventry
where
i
did
some
business
with
him
and
so
with
sir
pen
who
i
found
with
coventry
teaching
of
him
the
map
to
understand
jamaica
the
great
talk
of
the
towne
is
the
strange
election
that
the
city
of
london
made
yesterday
for
viz
fowle
love
jones
and
sir
thompson
was
the
fourth
member
men
that
so
far
from
being
episcopall
are
thought
to
be
anabaptists
and
chosen
with
a
great
deal
of
zeale
in
spite
of
the
other
party
that
thought
themselves
so
strong
calling
out
in
the
hall
no
bishops
no
lord
bishops
it
do
make
people
to
fear
it
may
come
to
worse
by
being
an
example
to
the
country
to
do
the
same
and
indeed
the
bishops
are
so
high
that
very
few
do
love
them
to
the
red
bull
where
i
had
not
been
since
plays
come
up
again
up
to
the
tireing
room
where
strange
the
confusion
and
disorder
that
there
is
among
them
in
fitting
themselves
especially
here
where
the
clothes
are
very
poore
and
the
actors
but
common
fellows
at
last
into
the
pitt
where
i
think
there
was
not
above
ten
more
than
myself
and
not
one
hundred
in
the
whole
house
and
the
play
which
is
called
all
lost
by
lust
a
tragedy
by
poorly
done
and
with
so
much
disorder
among
others
in
the
the
boy
that
was
to
sing
a
song
not
singing
it
right
his
master
fell
about
his
eares
and
beat
him
so
that
it
put
the
whole
house
in
an
uprore
met
my
uncle
wight
and
with
him
baron
who
told
us
how
crofton
the
great
presbyterian
minister
that
had
preached
so
highly
against
bishops
is
clapped
up
this
day
in
the
tower
which
do
please
some
and
displease
others
exceedingly
april
to
james
park
where
i
saw
the
duke
of
york
playing
at
pelemele
the
first
time
that
ever
i
saw
the
sport
then
to
the
dolphin
to
sir
batten
and
pen
and
other
company
among
others
delabar
where
strange
how
these
men
who
at
other
times
are
all
wise
men
do
now
in
their
drink
betwitt
and
reproach
one
another
with
their
former
conditions
and
their
actions
as
in
public
concerns
till
i
was
ashamed
to
see
it
i
hear
that
the
dutch
have
sent
the
king
a
great
present
of
money
which
we
think
will
stop
the
match
with
portugal
and
judge
this
to
be
the
reason
that
our
so
great
haste
in
sending
the
two
ships
to
the
east
indys
is
also
stayed
to
white
hall
and
there
i
met
with
fuller
of
twickenham
newly
come
from
ireland
and
took
him
to
my
lord
where
he
and
i
dined
and
he
did
give
my
lord
and
me
a
good
account
of
the
condition
of
ireland
and
how
it
come
to
pass
through
the
joyning
of
the
fanatiques
and
the
presbyterians
that
the
latter
and
the
former
are
in
their
declaration
put
together
under
the
names
of
fanatiques
william
fuller
of
magdalene
wall
oxford
was
a
schoolmaster
at
twickenham
during
the
rebellion
and
at
the
restoration
became
dean
of
patrick
and
in
bishop
of
limerick
and
in
was
translated
to
lincoln
ob
at
the
sale
of
old
stores
at
chatham
and
among
other
things
sold
there
was
all
the
state
armes
which
sir
batten
bought
intending
to
set
up
some
of
the
images
in
his
garden
and
the
rest
to
burn
on
the
coronacion
night
then
to
rochester
and
there
saw
the
cathedrall
which
is
now
fitting
for
use
and
the
organ
then
then
away
thence
observing
the
great
doors
of
the
church
as
they
say
covered
with
the
skins
of
the
danes
met
my
lord
with
the
duke
and
after
a
little
talk
with
him
i
went
to
the
and
there
saw
the
king
heale
the
first
time
that
ever
i
saw
him
do
it
which
he
did
with
great
gravity
and
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
an
ugly
office
and
a
simple
one
comes
my
boy
to
tell
me
that
the
duke
of
york
had
sent
for
all
the
principall
officers
to
come
to
him
so
i
went
by
water
to
coventry
and
there
staid
and
talked
a
good
while
with
him
till
all
the
rest
come
we
went
up
and
saw
the
duke
dress
himself
and
in
his
night
habitt
he
is
a
very
plain
man
then
he
sent
us
to
his
closett
where
we
saw
among
other
things
two
very
fine
chests
covered
with
gold
and
indian
varnish
given
him
by
the
east
india
company
of
holland
the
duke
comes
and
after
he
had
told
us
that
the
fleet
was
designed
for
algier
which
was
kept
from
us
till
now
we
did
advise
about
many
things
as
to
the
fitting
of
the
fleet
and
so
went
away
to
white
hall
and
in
the
saw
the
king
create
my
lord
chancellor
and
several
others
earles
and
crewe
and
several
others
barons
the
first
being
led
up
by
heralds
and
five
old
earles
to
the
king
and
there
the
patent
is
read
and
the
king
puts
on
his
vest
and
sword
and
coronett
and
gives
him
the
patent
and
then
he
kisseth
the
king
hand
and
rises
and
stands
covered
before
the
king
and
the
same
for
each
baron
only
he
is
led
up
by
three
of
the
old
barons
and
they
are
girt
with
swords
before
they
go
to
the
king
to
the
cockpitt
and
there
by
the
favour
of
one
mr
bowman
he
and
i
got
in
and
there
saw
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
his
duchesse
which
is
a
plain
woman
and
like
her
mother
my
lady
chancellor
and
so
saw
the
humersome
lieutenant
acted
before
the
king
but
not
very
well
done
the
humorous
lieutenant
a
by
beaumont
and
fletcher
but
my
pleasure
was
great
to
see
the
manner
of
it
and
so
many
great
beauties
but
above
all
palmer
with
whom
the
king
do
discover
a
great
deal
of
familiarity
dined
with
doctor
thos
pepys
doctor
in
civil
law
and
fayrebrother
and
all
our
talk
about
showe
and
our
trouble
that
it
is
like
to
be
a
wet
day
all
the
way
is
so
thronged
with
people
to
see
the
triumphall
arches
that
i
could
hardly
pass
for
them
the
king
going
from
the
tower
to
white
hall
up
early
and
made
myself
as
fine
as
i
could
and
put
on
my
velvet
coat
the
first
day
that
i
put
it
on
though
made
half
a
year
ago
and
being
ready
sir
batten
my
lady
and
his
two
daughters
and
his
son
and
wife
and
sir
pen
and
his
son
and
i
went
to
young
the
flag
maker
in
and
there
we
had
a
good
room
to
ourselves
with
wine
and
good
cake
and
saw
the
show
very
well
in
which
it
is
impossible
to
relate
the
glory
of
this
day
expressed
in
the
clothes
of
them
that
rid
and
their
horses
and
among
others
my
lord
sandwich
embroidery
and
diamonds
were
not
ordinary
among
them
the
knights
of
the
bath
was
a
brave
sight
of
itself
and
their
esquires
among
which
armiger
was
an
esquire
to
one
of
the
knights
remarquable
were
the
two
men
that
represent
the
two
dukes
of
normandy
and
aquitane
the
bishops
come
next
after
barons
which
is
the
higher
place
which
makes
me
think
that
the
next
parliament
they
will
be
called
to
the
house
of
lords
my
lord
monk
rode
bare
after
the
king
and
led
in
his
hand
a
spare
horse
as
being
master
of
the
horse
the
king
in
a
most
rich
embroidered
suit
and
cloak
looked
most
noble
wadlow
the
vintner
at
the
devil
in
did
lead
a
fine
company
of
soldiers
all
young
comely
men
in
white
doublets
there
followed
the
chamberlain
sir
carteret
a
company
of
men
all
like
turkes
but
i
know
not
yet
what
they
are
for
the
streets
all
gravelled
and
the
houses
hung
with
carpets
before
them
made
brave
show
and
the
ladies
out
of
the
windows
so
glorious
was
the
show
with
gold
and
silver
that
we
were
not
able
to
look
at
it
our
eyes
at
last
being
so
much
overcome
both
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
took
notice
of
us
as
they
saw
us
at
the
window
in
the
evening
by
water
to
white
hall
to
my
lord
and
there
i
spoke
with
my
lord
he
talked
with
me
about
his
suit
which
was
made
in
france
and
cost
him
and
very
rich
it
is
with
embroidery
coronacon
day
about
four
i
rose
and
got
to
the
abbey
where
i
followed
sir
denham
the
surveyor
with
some
company
that
he
was
leading
in
created
at
the
restoration
and
general
of
all
the
king
buildings
better
know
as
the
author
of
cooper
hill
ob
and
with
much
ado
by
the
favour
of
cooper
his
man
did
get
up
into
a
great
scaffold
across
the
north
end
of
the
abbey
where
with
a
great
deal
of
patience
i
sat
from
past
four
till
eleven
before
the
king
come
in
and
a
great
pleasure
it
was
to
see
the
abbey
raised
in
the
middle
all
covered
with
red
and
a
throne
that
is
a
chaire
and
on
the
top
of
it
and
all
the
officers
of
all
kinds
so
much
as
the
very
fidlers
in
red
vests
at
last
comes
in
the
dean
and
prebends
of
westminster
with
the
bishops
many
of
them
in
cloth
of
gold
copes
and
after
them
the
nobility
all
in
their
parliament
robes
which
was
a
most
magnificent
sight
then
the
duke
and
the
king
with
a
scepter
carried
by
my
lord
sandwich
and
sword
and
wand
before
him
and
the
crowne
too
the
king
in
his
robes
which
was
very
fine
and
after
all
had
placed
themselves
there
was
a
sermon
and
the
service
and
then
in
the
quire
at
the
high
altar
the
king
passed
through
all
the
ceremonies
of
the
coronation
which
to
my
great
grief
i
and
most
in
the
abbey
could
not
see
the
crowne
being
put
upon
his
head
a
great
shout
begun
and
he
come
forth
to
the
throne
and
there
passed
through
more
ceremonies
as
taking
the
oath
and
having
things
read
to
him
by
the
bishopp
and
his
lords
who
put
on
their
caps
as
soon
as
the
king
put
on
his
crowne
and
bishops
come
and
kneeled
before
him
but
three
times
the
king
at
armes
went
to
the
three
open
places
on
the
scaffold
and
proclaimed
that
if
any
one
could
show
any
reason
why
charles
stewart
should
not
be
king
of
england
that
now
he
should
come
and
speak
and
a
generall
pardon
also
was
read
by
the
lord
chancellor
and
meddalls
flung
up
and
down
by
my
lord
cornwallis
sir
frederick
cornwallis
had
been
created
a
baron
three
days
before
the
coronation
he
was
treasurer
of
his
majesty
household
and
a
privy
counsellor
ob
of
silver
but
i
could
not
come
by
any
but
so
great
a
noise
that
i
could
make
but
little
of
the
musique
and
indeed
it
was
lost
to
every
body
i
went
out
a
little
while
before
the
king
had
done
all
his
ceremonies
and
went
round
the
abbey
to
westminster
hall
all
the
way
within
rayles
and
people
with
the
ground
covered
with
blue
cloth
and
scaffolds
all
the
way
into
the
hall
i
got
where
it
was
very
fine
with
hangings
and
scaffolds
one
upon
another
full
of
brave
ladies
and
my
wife
in
one
little
one
on
the
right
hand
here
i
staid
walking
up
and
down
and
at
last
upon
one
of
the
side
stalls
i
stood
and
saw
the
king
come
in
with
all
the
persons
but
the
soldiers
that
were
yesterday
in
the
cavalcade
and
a
most
pleasant
sight
it
was
to
see
them
in
their
several
robes
and
the
king
come
in
with
his
crowne
on
and
his
sceptre
in
his
hand
under
a
canopy
borne
up
by
six
silver
staves
carried
by
barons
of
the
cinque
ports
and
little
bells
at
every
end
and
after
a
long
time
he
got
up
to
the
farther
end
and
all
set
themselves
down
at
their
several
tables
and
that
was
also
a
brave
sight
and
the
king
first
course
carried
up
by
the
knights
of
the
bath
and
many
fine
ceremonies
there
was
of
the
heralds
leading
up
people
before
him
and
bowing
and
my
lord
of
albemarle
going
to
the
kitchin
and
eating
a
bit
of
the
first
dish
that
was
to
go
to
the
king
table
but
above
all
was
these
three
lords
northumberland
and
suffolke
james
howard
third
earl
of
suffolk
and
the
duke
of
ormond
coming
before
the
courses
on
horseback
and
staying
so
all
and
at
last
bringing
up
dymock
the
king
champion
all
in
armour
on
horseback
with
his
speare
and
targett
carried
before
him
and
a
herald
proclaims
that
if
any
dare
deny
charles
stewart
to
be
lawful
king
of
england
here
was
a
champion
that
would
fight
with
him
and
with
these
words
the
champion
flings
down
his
gauntlet
and
all
this
he
do
three
times
in
his
going
up
towards
the
king
table
to
which
when
he
is
come
the
king
drinks
to
him
and
then
sends
him
the
cup
which
is
of
gold
and
he
drinks
it
off
and
then
rides
back
again
with
the
cup
in
his
hand
i
went
from
table
to
table
to
see
the
bishops
and
all
others
at
their
dinner
and
was
infinitely
pleased
with
it
and
at
the
lords
table
i
met
with
william
howe
and
he
spoke
to
my
lord
for
me
and
he
did
give
him
four
rabbits
and
a
pullet
and
so
creed
and
i
got
minshell
to
give
us
some
bread
and
so
we
at
a
stall
eat
it
as
every
body
else
did
what
they
could
get
i
took
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
to
go
up
and
down
and
look
upon
the
ladies
and
to
hear
the
musique
of
all
sorts
but
above
all
the
violins
about
six
at
night
they
had
dined
and
i
went
up
to
my
wife
and
strange
it
is
to
think
that
these
two
days
have
held
up
fair
till
now
that
all
is
done
and
the
king
gone
out
of
the
hall
and
then
it
fell
and
thundering
and
lightening
as
i
have
not
seen
it
do
for
some
years
which
people
did
take
great
notice
of
god
blessing
of
the
work
of
these
two
days
which
is
a
foolery
to
take
too
much
notice
of
such
things
i
observed
little
disorder
in
all
this
only
the
king
footmen
had
got
hold
of
the
canopy
and
would
keep
it
from
the
barons
of
the
cinque
ports
which
they
endeavoured
to
force
from
them
again
but
could
not
do
it
till
my
lord
duke
of
albemarle
caused
it
to
be
put
into
sir
pye
hand
till
to
be
decided
sir
robert
pye
of
faringdon
house
berks
married
ann
daughter
of
the
celebrated
john
hampden
they
lived
together
years
and
died
in
within
a
few
weeks
of
each
other
at
bowyer
a
great
deal
of
company
some
i
knew
others
i
did
not
here
we
staid
upon
the
leads
and
below
till
it
was
late
expecting
to
see
the
but
they
were
not
performed
night
only
the
city
had
a
light
like
a
glory
round
about
it
with
bonfires
at
last
i
went
to
and
there
sent
crockford
to
my
father
and
my
house
to
tell
them
i
could
not
come
home
because
of
the
dirt
and
a
coach
could
not
be
had
and
so
i
took
my
wife
and
frankleyn
who
i
profered
the
civility
of
lying
with
my
wife
at
hunt
to
in
which
at
the
further
end
there
were
three
great
bonfires
and
a
great
many
great
gallants
men
and
women
and
they
laid
hold
of
us
and
would
have
us
drink
the
king
health
upon
our
knees
kneeling
upon
a
faggot
which
we
all
did
they
drinking
to
us
one
after
another
which
we
thought
a
strange
frolique
but
these
gallants
continued
there
a
great
while
and
i
wondered
to
see
how
the
ladies
did
tipple
at
last
i
sent
my
wife
and
her
bedfellow
to
bed
and
hunt
and
i
went
in
with
thornbury
who
did
give
the
company
all
their
wine
he
being
yeoman
of
the
to
the
king
and
there
with
his
wife
and
two
of
his
sisters
and
some
gallant
sparks
that
were
there
we
drank
the
king
health
and
nothing
else
till
one
of
the
gentlemen
fell
down
stark
drunk
and
there
lay
and
i
went
to
my
lord
pretty
well
thus
did
the
day
end
with
joy
every
where
and
blessed
be
god
i
have
not
heard
of
any
mischance
to
any
body
through
it
all
but
only
to
serjt
glynne
whose
horse
fell
upon
him
yesterday
and
is
like
to
kill
him
which
people
do
please
themselves
to
see
how
just
god
is
to
punish
the
rogue
at
such
a
time
as
this
he
being
now
one
of
the
king
serjeants
he
had
been
recorder
of
london
and
during
the
protectorate
was
made
chief
justice
of
the
upper
bench
nevertheless
he
did
charles
ii
great
service
and
was
in
consequence
knighted
and
appointed
king
serjeant
and
his
son
created
a
baronet
ob
and
rode
in
the
cavalcade
with
maynard
to
whom
people
wish
the
same
fortune
john
maynard
an
eminent
lawyer
made
serjeant
to
cromwell
in
and
afterwards
king
serjeant
by
charles
who
knighted
him
in
he
was
chosen
member
for
berealston
and
sat
in
every
parliament
till
the
revolution
ob
aged
there
was
also
this
night
in
a
woman
had
her
eye
put
out
by
a
boy
flinging
a
firebrand
into
the
coach
now
after
all
this
i
can
say
that
besides
the
pleasure
of
the
sight
of
these
glorious
things
i
may
now
shut
my
eyes
against
any
other
objects
nor
for
the
future
trouble
myself
to
see
things
of
state
and
showe
as
being
sure
never
to
see
the
like
again
in
this
world
at
night
set
myself
to
write
down
these
three
diary
and
while
i
am
about
it
i
hear
the
noise
of
the
chambers
chamber
a
species
of
great
gun
and
other
things
of
the
works
which
are
now
playing
upon
the
thames
before
the
king
and
i
wish
myself
with
them
being
sorry
not
to
see
them
this
morning
my
wife
and
i
and
creed
took
coach
and
in
took
up
hater
and
his
wife
who
through
her
maske
seemed
at
first
to
be
an
old
woman
but
afterwards
i
found
her
to
be
a
very
pretty
modest
black
woman
we
got
a
small
bait
at
leatherhead
and
so
to
godlyman
godalming
where
we
lay
all
night
i
am
sorry
that
i
am
not
at
london
to
be
at
parke
among
the
great
gallants
and
ladies
which
will
be
very
fine
may
up
early
and
bated
at
petersfield
in
the
room
which
the
king
lay
in
lately
at
his
being
there
here
very
merry
and
played
with
our
wives
at
bowles
then
we
set
forth
again
and
so
to
portsmouth
seeming
to
me
to
be
a
very
pleasant
and
strong
place
and
we
lay
at
the
red
lyon
where
haselrigge
and
scott
and
walton
did
hold
their
councill
when
they
were
here
against
lambert
and
the
committee
of
safety
to
see
the
room
where
the
duke
of
buckingham
was
killed
by
felton
i
hear
that
the
duke
of
york
son
is
this
day
dead
which
i
believe
will
please
every
body
and
i
hear
that
the
duke
and
his
lady
themselves
are
not
much
troubled
at
it
at
the
savoy
heard
fuller
preach
upon
david
words
i
will
wait
with
patience
all
the
days
of
my
appointed
time
until
my
change
comes
but
methought
it
was
a
poor
dry
sermon
and
i
am
afraid
my
former
high
esteem
of
his
preaching
was
more
out
of
opinion
than
judgment
met
with
creed
with
whom
i
went
and
walked
in
and
from
thence
to
islington
and
there
eate
and
drank
at
the
house
my
father
and
we
were
wont
of
old
to
go
to
and
after
that
walked
homeward
and
parted
in
smithfield
and
so
i
home
much
wondering
to
see
how
things
are
altered
with
creed
who
twelve
months
ago
might
have
been
got
to
hang
himself
almost
as
soon
as
go
to
a
house
on
a
sunday
i
went
to
westminster
where
it
was
very
pleasant
to
see
the
hall
in
the
condition
it
is
now
with
the
judges
on
the
benches
at
the
further
end
of
it
which
i
had
not
seen
all
this
terme
till
now
lord
day
i
walked
in
the
morning
towards
westminster
and
seeing
many
people
at
york
house
i
went
down
and
found
them
at
masse
it
being
the
spanish
ambassador
and
so
i
got
into
one
of
the
gallerys
and
there
heard
two
masses
done
i
think
not
in
so
much
state
as
i
have
seen
them
heretofore
after
that
into
the
garden
and
walked
an
hour
or
two
but
found
it
not
so
fine
a
place
as
i
always
took
it
for
by
the
outside
capt
ferrers
and
howe
and
myself
to
wilkinson
at
the
crowne
then
to
my
lord
where
we
went
and
sat
talking
and
laughing
in
the
a
great
while
all
our
talk
upon
their
going
to
sea
this
voyage
which
capt
ferrers
is
in
some
doubt
whether
he
shall
do
or
no
but
swears
that
he
would
go
if
he
were
sure
never
to
come
back
again
and
i
giving
him
some
hopes
he
grew
so
mad
with
joy
that
he
fell
and
leaping
like
a
madman
now
it
fell
out
that
the
balcone
windows
were
open
and
he
went
to
the
rayle
and
made
an
offer
to
leap
over
and
asked
what
if
he
should
leap
over
there
i
told
him
i
would
give
him
if
he
did
not
go
to
sea
with
that
thought
i
shut
the
doors
and
howe
hindered
him
all
we
could
yet
he
opened
them
again
and
with
a
vault
leaps
down
into
the
garden
the
greatest
and
most
desperate
frolic
that
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
i
run
to
see
what
was
become
of
him
and
we
found
him
crawled
upon
his
knees
but
could
not
rise
so
we
went
down
into
the
garden
and
dragged
him
to
a
bench
where
he
looked
like
a
dead
man
but
could
not
stir
and
though
he
had
broke
nothing
yet
his
pain
in
his
back
was
such
as
he
could
not
endure
with
this
my
lord
who
was
in
the
little
new
room
come
to
us
in
amaze
and
bid
us
carry
him
up
which
by
our
strength
we
did
and
so
laid
him
in
east
room
by
the
doore
where
he
lay
in
great
pain
we
sent
for
a
doctor
and
chyrurgeon
but
none
to
be
found
till
by
chance
comes
in
clerke
who
is
afraid
of
him
so
we
went
for
a
lodging
for
him
he
recovered
up
early
and
with
sir
slingsby
and
major
waters
the
deafe
gentleman
his
friend
for
company
sake
to
the
the
first
time
that
i
ever
knew
where
it
was
and
there
staid
while
he
read
a
commission
for
enquiry
into
some
of
the
king
lands
and
houses
thereabouts
that
are
given
his
brother
and
then
we
took
boat
to
woolwich
where
we
staid
and
gave
order
for
the
fitting
out
of
some
more
ships
presently
and
then
to
deptford
where
we
did
the
same
and
so
took
barge
again
and
were
overtaken
by
the
king
in
his
barge
he
having
been
down
the
river
with
his
yacht
this
day
for
pleasure
to
try
it
and
as
i
hear
commissioner
pett
do
prove
better
than
the
dutch
one
and
that
that
his
brother
built
while
we
were
upon
the
water
one
of
the
greatest
showers
of
rain
fell
that
ever
i
saw
the
comptroller
and
i
landed
with
our
barge
at
the
temple
and
from
thence
i
went
to
my
father
and
there
did
give
order
about
some
clothes
to
be
made
in
my
black
silk
suit
the
first
day
i
have
put
it
on
this
year
to
my
lord
mayor
by
coach
with
a
great
deal
of
honourable
company
and
great
entertainment
at
table
i
had
very
good
discourse
with
ashmole
wherein
he
did
assure
me
that
frogs
and
many
insects
do
often
fall
from
the
sky
ready
formed
bates
singularity
in
not
rising
up
nor
drinking
the
nor
other
healths
at
the
table
was
very
much
observed
from
thence
we
all
took
coach
and
to
our
office
and
there
sat
till
it
was
late
and
so
home
and
to
bed
by
this
day
was
kept
a
through
the
towne
and
it
pleased
me
to
see
the
little
boys
walk
up
and
down
in
procession
with
their
staffs
in
their
hands
as
i
had
myself
long
ago
done
sir
batten
told
me
how
prin
among
the
two
or
three
that
did
refuse
to
receive
the
sacrament
upon
their
knees
was
offered
by
a
mistake
the
drinke
afterwards
which
he
did
receive
being
denied
the
drinke
by
gunning
unless
he
would
take
it
on
his
knees
and
after
that
by
another
the
bread
was
brought
him
and
he
did
take
it
sitting
which
is
thought
very
preposterous
with
shepley
to
the
exchange
about
business
and
there
by
rawlinson
favour
got
into
a
balcone
over
against
the
exchange
and
there
saw
the
hangman
burn
by
vote
of
parliament
two
old
acts
the
one
for
constituting
us
a
commonwealth
and
the
other
i
have
forgot
it
was
an
act
for
subscribing
the
engagement
king
rose
early
and
put
six
spoons
and
a
porringer
of
silver
in
my
pocket
to
give
away
sir
pen
and
i
took
coach
and
the
weather
and
way
being
foule
went
to
walthamstow
and
being
come
there
heard
radcliffe
my
former
school
fellow
at
paul
who
is
yet
a
merry
boy
preach
upon
nay
let
him
take
all
since
my
lord
the
king
is
returned
he
read
all
and
his
sermon
very
simple
back
to
dinner
at
sir
william
batten
and
then
after
a
walk
in
the
fine
gardens
we
went
to
browne
where
sir
pen
and
i
were
godfathers
and
jordan
and
shipman
godmothers
to
her
boy
and
there
before
and
after
the
christening
we
were
with
the
woman
above
in
her
chamber
but
whether
we
carried
ourselves
well
or
ill
i
know
not
but
i
was
directed
by
young
batten
one
passage
of
a
lady
that
eats
wafers
with
her
dog
did
a
little
displease
me
i
did
give
the
midwife
and
the
nurse
and
the
maid
of
the
house
but
for
as
much
i
expected
to
give
the
name
to
the
childe
but
did
not
it
being
called
john
i
forbore
then
to
give
my
plate
this
day
i
hear
the
parliament
have
ordered
a
bill
to
be
brought
in
for
restoring
the
bishops
to
the
house
of
lords
which
they
had
not
done
so
soon
but
to
spite
prin
who
is
every
day
so
bitter
against
them
in
his
discourse
in
the
house
great
talk
now
how
the
parliament
intend
to
make
a
collection
of
free
gifts
to
the
king
through
the
kingdom
but
i
think
it
will
not
come
to
much
june
to
my
lord
crewe
to
dinner
and
had
very
good
discourse
about
having
of
young
noblemen
and
gentlemen
to
think
of
going
to
sea
as
being
as
honourable
service
as
the
land
war
and
among
other
things
he
told
us
how
in
queen
elizabeth
time
one
young
nobleman
would
wait
with
a
trencher
at
the
back
of
another
till
he
come
to
age
himself
and
witnessed
in
my
young
lord
of
kent
that
then
was
who
waited
upon
my
lord
bedford
at
table
when
a
letter
come
to
my
lord
bedford
that
the
earldome
of
kent
was
fallen
to
his
servant
the
young
lord
and
so
he
rose
from
table
and
made
him
sit
down
in
his
place
and
took
a
lower
for
himself
for
so
he
was
by
place
to
sit
to
white
hall
and
there
met
with
dean
fuller
and
walked
a
great
while
with
him
among
other
things
discoursed
of
the
liberty
the
bishop
by
name
he
of
galloway
takes
to
admit
into
orders
any
body
that
will
among
others
roundtree
a
simple
mechanique
that
was
a
person
formerly
of
the
fleet
he
told
me
he
would
complain
of
it
early
to
my
lord
who
privately
told
me
how
the
king
had
made
him
embassador
in
the
bringing
over
the
queen
that
he
is
to
go
to
algier
to
settle
the
business
and
to
put
the
fleet
in
order
there
and
so
to
come
back
to
lisbone
with
three
ships
and
there
to
meet
the
fleet
that
is
to
follow
him
he
sent
for
me
to
tell
me
that
he
do
intrust
me
with
the
seeing
of
all
things
done
in
his
absence
as
to
this
great
preparation
as
i
shall
receive
orders
from
my
lord
chancellor
and
edward
montagu
at
all
which
my
heart
is
above
measure
glad
for
my
lord
honour
and
some
profit
to
myself
i
hope
by
and
by
out
with
shepley
walden
lionel
for
huntingdon
rolt
mackworth
and
alderman
backwell
to
a
house
hard
by
to
drink
lambeth
ale

i
back
to
the
wardrobe
and
there
found
my
lord
going
to
trinity
house
this
being
the
solemn
day
of
choosing
master
and
my
lord
is
chosen
at
the
office
this
morning
sir
carteret
with
us
and
we
agreed
upon
a
letter
to
the
duke
of
york
to
tell
him
the
sad
condition
of
this
office
for
want
of
money
how
men
are
not
able
to
serve
us
more
without
some
money
and
that
now
the
credit
of
the
office
is
brought
so
low
that
none
will
sell
us
any
thing
without
our
personal
security
given
for
the
same
wednesday
a
day
kept
between
a
fast
and
a
feast
the
bishops
not
being
ready
enough
to
keep
the
fast
for
foule
weather
before
fair
weather
come
and
so
they
were
forced
to
keep
it
between
both
then
to
white
hall
where
i
met
my
lord
who
told
me
he
must
have
laid
out
in
cloth
to
give
in
barbary
as
presents
among
the
turkes
this
day
holden
sent
me
a
bever
which
cost
me
went
to
moorefields
and
there
walked
and
stood
and
saw
the
wrestling
which
i
never
saw
so
much
of
before
between
the
north
and
west
countrymen
chetwind
fell
commending
of
hooker
ecclesiastical
polity
as
the
best
book
and
the
only
one
that
made
him
a
christian
which
puts
me
upon
the
buying
of
it
which
i
will
do
shortly
lord
day
to
church
where
we
observe
the
trade
of
briefs
is
come
now
up
to
so
constant
a
course
every
sunday
that
we
resolve
to
give
no
more
to
them
this
day
the
portuguese
embassador
come
to
white
hall
to
take
leave
of
the
king
he
being
now
going
to
end
all
with
the
queen
and
to
send
her
over
july
went
to
sir
william
davenant
opera
this
being
the
fourth
day
that
it
hath
begun
and
the
first
that
i
have
seen
it
sir
william
davenant
the
celebrated
dramatic
writer
and
patentee
of
the
duke
theatre
in
lincoln
inn
fields
ob
aged
was
acted
the
second
part
of
the
siege
of
rhodes
of
which
sir
davenant
was
the
author
we
staid
a
very
great
while
for
the
king
and
queen
of
bohemia
and
by
the
breaking
of
a
board
over
our
heads
we
had
a
great
deal
of
dust
fell
into
the
ladies
necks
and
the
men
haire
which
made
good
sport
the
king
being
come
the
scene
opened
which
indeed
is
very
fine
and
magnificent
and
well
acted
all
but
the
eunuche
who
was
so
much
out
that
he
was
hissed
off
the
stage
dined
with
my
lady
who
is
in
some
probably
meant
for
handsome
in
the
mourning
for
her
brother
saml
crewe
who
died
yesterday
of
the
spotted
fever
i
went
to
the
theatre
and
there
i
saw
claracilla
a
by
thomas
killigrew
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
it
well
acted
but
strange
to
see
this
house
that
used
to
be
so
thronged
now
empty
since
the
opera
begun
and
so
will
continue
for
a
while
i
believe
waked
this
morning
with
news
brought
me
by
a
messenger
on
purpose
that
my
uncle
robert
of
brampton
in
huntingdonshire
is
dead
so
i
set
out
on
horseback
and
got
well
by
nine
to
brampton
where
i
found
my
father
well
my
uncle
corps
in
a
coffin
standing
upon
in
the
chimney
in
the
hall
but
it
begun
to
smell
and
so
i
caused
it
to
be
set
forth
in
the
yard
all
night
and
watched
by
my
aunt
lord
day
ln
the
morning
my
father
and
i
read
the
will
where
though
he
gives
me
nothing
at
present
till
my
death
or
at
least
very
little
yet
i
am
glad
to
see
that
he
hath
done
so
well
for
us
all
and
well
to
the
rest
of
his
kindred
after
that
done
we
went
about
getting
things
as
ribbands
and
gloves
ready
for
the
burial
which
in
the
afternoon
was
done
where
it
being
sunday
all
people
far
and
near
come
in
and
in
the
greatest
disorder
that
ever
i
saw
we
made
shift
to
serve
them
with
what
we
had
of
mine
and
other
things
and
then
to
carry
him
to
the
church
where
taylor
buried
him
and
turner
preached
a
funerall
sermon
to
hinchingbroke
which
is
now
all
in
dirt
because
of
my
lord
building
which
will
make
it
very
magnificent
back
to
brampton
up
by
three
this
morning
and
rode
to
cambridge
to
king
college
chappel
where
i
found
the
scholars
in
their
surplices
at
the
service
with
the
organs
which
is
a
strange
sight
to
what
it
used
in
my
time
to
be
here
i
rode
to
impington
where
i
found
my
old
uncle
talbot
pepys
sitting
all
alone
like
a
man
out
of
the
world
he
can
hardly
see
but
all
things
else
he
do
pretty
livelyly
i
come
to
hatfield
before
twelve
and
walked
all
alone
to
the
vineyard
which
is
now
a
very
beautiful
place
again
and
coming
back
i
met
with
looker
my
lord
gardener
a
friend
of
eglin
who
showed
me
the
house
the
chappel
with
brave
pictures
and
above
all
the
gardens
such
as
i
never
saw
in
all
my
life
nor
so
good
flowers
nor
so
great
gooseburys
as
big
as
nutmegs
to
horse
again
and
with
much
ado
got
to
london
hill
of
cambridge
tells
me
that
yesterday
put
a
change
to
the
whole
state
of
england
as
to
the
church
for
the
king
now
would
be
forced
to
favour
presbytery
or
that
the
city
would
leave
him
but
i
heed
not
what
he
says
though
upon
enquiry
i
do
find
that
things
in
the
parliament
are
in
a
great
disorder
to
westminster
hall
where
it
was
expected
that
the
parliament
was
to
have
been
adjourned
for
two
or
three
months
but
something
hinders
it
for
a
day
or
two
in
the
lobby
i
spoke
with
george
montagu
and
advised
about
a
ship
to
carry
my
lord
hinchingbroke
and
the
rest
of
the
young
gentlemen
to
france
and
they
have
resolved
of
going
in
a
hired
vessell
from
rye
and
not
in
a
man
of
war
he
told
me
in
discourse
that
my
lord
chancellor
is
much
envied
and
that
many
great
men
such
as
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
my
lord
of
bristoll
george
second
earl
of
bristol
do
endeavour
to
undermine
him
and
that
he
believes
it
will
not
be
done
for
that
the
king
though
he
loves
him
not
in
the
way
of
a
companion
as
he
do
these
young
gallants
that
can
answer
him
in
his
pleasures
yet
can
not
be
without
him
for
his
policy
and
service
after
my
had
done
with
me
this
morning
i
went
to
white
hall
and
westminster
hall
where
i
found
the
king
expected
to
come
and
adjourne
the
parliament
i
found
the
two
houses
at
a
great
difference
about
the
lords
challenging
their
privileges
not
to
have
their
houses
searched
which
makes
them
deny
to
pass
the
house
of
commons
bill
for
searching
for
pamphlets
and
seditious
books
thence
by
water
to
the
wardrobe
meeting
the
king
upon
the
water
going
in
his
barge
to
adjourne
the
house
where
i
dined
with
my
lady
august
i
made
myself
ready
to
get
for
cambridge
at
cambridge
pechell
john
pechell
made
master
of
magdalene
college
cambridge
sanchy
and
others
tell
me
how
high
the
old
doctors
are
in
the
university
over
those
they
found
there
though
a
great
deal
better
scholars
than
themselves
for
which
i
am
very
sorry
and
above
all
gunning
at
night
i
took
horse
and
rode
with
roger
pepys
and
his
two
brothers
to
impington
to
church
and
had
a
good
plain
sermon
at
our
coming
in
the
all
rose
with
so
much
reverence
and
when
the
parson
begins
he
begins
right
worshipfull
and
dearly
beloved
to
us
to
church
again
and
after
supper
to
talk
about
publique
matters
wherein
roger
pepys
told
me
how
basely
things
had
been
carried
in
parliament
by
the
young
men
that
did
labour
to
oppose
all
things
that
were
moved
by
serious
men
that
they
are
the
most
prophane
swearing
fellows
that
ever
he
heard
in
his
life
which
makes
him
think
that
they
will
spoil
all
and
bring
things
into
a
warr
again
if
they
can
took
horse
for
london
and
with
much
ado
the
ways
being
very
bad
got
to
baldwick
baldock
i
find
that
both
here
and
every
where
else
that
i
come
the
quakers
do
still
continue
and
rather
grow
than
lessen
i
to
white
hall
where
after
four
comes
my
lord
privy
seale
william
first
viscount
and
second
baron
say
and
sele
made
lord
privy
seal
at
the
restoration
ob
april
and
so
we
went
up
to
his
chamber
over
the
gate
at
white
hall
where
he
asked
me
what
deputacon
i
had
from
my
lord
i
told
him
none
but
that
i
am
sworn
my
lord
deputy
by
both
of
the
secretarys
which
did
satisfye
him
so
he
caused
moore
to
read
over
all
the
bills
and
all
ended
very
well
to
walks
and
there
staid
a
good
while
where
i
met
with
ned
pickering
who
told
me
what
a
great
match
of
hunting
of
a
stagg
the
king
had
yesterday
and
how
the
king
tired
all
their
horses
and
come
home
with
not
above
two
or
three
able
to
keep
pace
with
him
this
morning
sir
batten
and
sir
penn
and
i
waited
upon
the
duke
of
york
in
his
chamber
to
give
him
an
account
of
the
condition
of
the
navy
for
lack
of
money
and
how
our
own
very
bills
are
offered
upon
the
exchange
to
be
sold
at
in
the
loss
he
is
much
troubled
at
it
and
will
speak
to
the
king
and
council
of
it
this
morning
to
the
opera
which
begins
again
with
the
witts
a
comedy
by
sir
w
davenant
never
acted
yet
with
scenes
and
the
king
and
duke
and
duchesse
were
there
who
dined
with
sir
finch
reader
at
the
temple
in
great
state
and
indeed
it
is
a
most
excellent
play
and
admirable
scenes
at
the
office
all
the
morning
though
little
to
do
because
all
our
clerkes
are
gone
to
the
buriall
of
tom
whitten
one
of
the
controller
clerkes
a
very
ingenious
and
a
likely
young
man
to
live
as
any
in
the
office
but
it
is
such
a
sickly
time
both
in
the
city
and
country
every
where
of
a
sort
of
fever
that
never
was
heard
of
almost
unless
it
was
in
a
among
others
the
famous
tom
fuller
is
dead
of
it
author
of
the
worthies
of
england
chaplain
to
the
king
and
prebendary
of
salisbury
and
nichols
dean
of
paul
matthew
nicholas
installed
dean
of
paul
july
ob
august
he
was
brother
to
sir
edward
nicholas
secretary
of
state
and
my
lord
general
monk
is
very
dangerously
at
the
privy
seale
where
we
had
a
seale
this
morning
then
met
with
ned
pickering
and
walked
with
him
into
park
where
i
had
not
been
a
great
while
and
there
found
great
and
very
noble
alterations
and
in
our
discourse
he
was
very
forward
to
complain
and
to
speak
loud
of
the
lewdnesse
and
beggary
of
the
court
which
i
am
sorry
to
hear
and
which
i
am
afraid
will
bring
all
to
ruin
again
i
to
the
opera
and
saw
the
witts
again
which
i
like
exceedingly
the
queen
of
bohemia
was
here
brought
by
my
lord
craven
william
first
earl
of
craven
a
privy
councillor
and
colonel
of
the
coldstream
guards
supposed
to
be
married
to
the
queen
of
bohemia
ob
aged
to
white
hall
and
there
hear
that
my
lord
general
monk
continues
very
ill
and
then
to
walk
in
james
park
and
saw
a
great
variety
of
fowle
which
i
never
saw
before
at
night
fell
to
read
in
hooker
ecclesiastical
polity
which
moore
did
give
me
last
wednesday
very
handsomely
bound
and
which
i
shall
read
with
great
pains
and
love
for
his
sake
i
am
sent
for
to
the
privy
seale
and
there
i
found
a
thing
of
my
lord
chancellor
to
be
sealed
this
afternoon
and
so
i
am
forced
to
go
to
worcester
house
where
severall
lords
are
met
in
council
this
afternoon
and
while
i
am
waiting
there
in
comes
the
king
in
a
plain
common
and
velvet
cap
in
which
he
seemed
a
very
ordinary
man
to
one
that
had
not
known
him
my
wife
and
i
to
the
theatre
and
there
saw
the
joviall
crew
or
the
merry
beggars
a
comedy
by
richard
brome
where
the
king
duke
and
duchesse
and
madame
palmer
were
and
my
wife
to
her
great
content
had
a
full
sight
of
them
all
the
while
at
court
things
are
in
very
ill
condition
there
being
so
much
emulacion
poverty
and
the
vices
of
drinking
swearing
and
loose
amours
that
i
know
not
what
will
be
the
end
of
it
but
confusion
and
the
clergy
so
high
that
all
people
that
i
meet
with
do
protest
against
their
practice
in
short
i
see
no
content
or
satisfaction
any
where
in
any
one
sort
of
people
the
benevolence
a
voluntary
contribution
made
by
the
subjects
to
their
sovereign
proves
so
little
and
an
occasion
of
so
much
discontent
every
where
that
it
had
better
it
had
sever
been
set
up
i
think
to
subscribe
we
are
at
our
office
quiet
only
for
lack
of
money
all
things
go
to
rack
our
very
bills
offered
to
be
sold
upon
the
exchange
at
per
cent
loss
we
are
upon
getting
sir
ford
house
added
to
our
office
but
i
see
so
many
difficulties
will
follow
in
pleasing
of
one
another
in
the
dividing
of
it
and
in
becoming
bound
personally
to
pay
the
rent
of
per
annum
that
i
do
believe
it
will
yet
scarce
come
to
pass
the
season
very
sickly
every
where
of
strange
and
fatal
fevers
september
captn
holmes
and
i
by
coach
to
white
hall
in
our
way
i
found
him
by
discourse
to
be
a
great
friend
of
my
lord
and
he
told
me
there
was
a
many
did
seek
to
remove
him
but
they
were
old
seamen
such
as
sir
minnes
a
and
afterwards
comptroller
of
the
navy
but
he
would
name
no
more
though
he
do
believe
sir
batten
is
one
of
them
that
do
envy
him
but
he
says
he
knows
that
the
king
do
so
love
him
and
the
duke
of
york
too
that
there
is
no
fear
of
him
he
seems
to
be
very
well
acquainted
with
the
king
mind
and
with
all
the
several
factions
at
court
and
spoke
all
with
so
much
franknesse
that
i
do
take
him
to
be
my
lord
good
friend
and
one
able
to
do
him
great
service
being
a
cunning
fellow
and
one
by
his
own
confession
to
me
that
can
put
on
two
several
faces
and
look
his
enemies
in
the
face
with
as
much
love
as
his
friends
but
good
god
what
an
age
is
this
and
what
a
world
is
this
that
a
man
can
not
live
without
playing
the
knave
and
dissimulation
i
find
that
there
are
endeavours
to
get
my
lord
out
of
play
at
sea
which
i
believe
coventry
and
the
duke
do
think
will
make
them
more
absolute
but
i
hope
for
all
this
they
will
not
be
able
to
do
it
dined
at
home
and
then
with
my
wife
to
the
wardrobe
where
my
lady
child
was
christened
my
lord
crewe
and
his
lady
and
my
lady
montagu
my
lord
were
the
witnesses
and
named
katherine
the
queen
elect
name
but
to
my
and
all
our
trouble
the
parson
of
the
parish
christened
her
and
did
not
sign
the
child
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
after
that
was
done
we
had
a
very
fine
banquet
having
appointed
the
young
ladies
at
the
wardrobe
to
go
with
them
to
the
play
my
wife
and
i
took
them
to
the
theatre
where
we
seated
ourselves
close
by
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
madame
palmer
which
was
great
content
and
indeed
i
can
never
enough
admire
her
beauty
and
here
was
bartholomew
fayre
a
comedy
by
ben
jonson
first
acted
in
with
the
acted
to
day
which
had
not
been
these
forty
years
it
being
so
satyricall
against
puritanism
they
durst
not
till
now
which
is
strange
they
should
already
dare
to
do
it
and
the
king
do
countenance
it
but
i
do
never
a
whit
like
it
the
better
for
the
puppets
but
rather
the
worse
thence
home
with
the
ladies
it
being
by
reason
of
our
staying
a
great
while
for
the
king
coming
and
the
length
of
the
play
near
nine
before
it
was
done
to
williams
who
did
carry
me
into
his
garden
where
he
hath
abundance
of
grapes
and
he
did
show
me
how
a
dog
that
he
hath
do
kill
all
the
cats
that
come
thither
to
kill
his
pigeons
and
do
afterwards
bury
them
and
do
it
with
so
much
care
that
they
shall
be
quite
covered
that
if
the
tip
of
the
tail
hangs
out
he
will
take
up
the
cat
again
and
dig
the
hole
deeper
which
is
very
strange
and
he
tells
me
that
he
do
believe
that
he
hath
killed
above
cats
to
my
lady
to
dinner
at
the
wardrobe
and
in
my
way
upon
the
thames
i
saw
the
king
new
that
is
come
now
for
the
king
to
take
pleasure
in
above
bridge
and
also
two
gundaloes
that
are
lately
brought
which
are
very
rich
and
fine
gondolas
davenant
uses
the
expression
step
into
one
of
your
peascod
boats
whose
tilts
are
not
so
sumptuous
as
the
roofs
of
gundaloes
letters
from
sea
that
speak
of
my
lord
being
well
and
his
action
though
not
considerable
of
any
side
at
argier
sir
pen
told
me
that
i
need
not
fear
any
reflection
upon
my
lord
for
their
ill
successe
at
argier
for
more
could
not
be
done
to
my
lord
crewe
and
dined
with
him
where
i
was
used
with
all
imaginable
kindness
both
from
him
and
her
and
i
see
that
he
is
afraid
my
lord
reputacon
will
a
little
suffer
in
common
talk
by
this
late
successe
but
there
is
no
help
for
it
now
the
queen
of
england
as
she
is
now
owned
and
called
i
hear
doth
keep
open
court
and
distinct
at
lisbone
at
noon
met
my
wife
at
the
wardrobe
and
there
dined
where
we
found
captn
country
my
little
captain
that
i
loved
who
carried
me
to
the
sound
with
some
grapes
and
millons
from
my
lord
at
lisbone
the
first
that
ever
i
saw
but
the
grapes
are
rare
things
in
the
afternoon
comes
edwd
montagu
by
appointment
this
morning
to
talk
with
my
lady
and
me
about
the
provisions
fit
to
be
bought
and
sent
to
my
lord
along
with
him
and
told
us
that
we
need
not
trouble
ourselves
how
to
buy
them
for
the
king
would
pay
for
all
and
that
he
would
take
care
to
get
them
which
put
my
lady
and
me
into
a
great
deal
of
ease
of
mind
here
we
staid
and
supped
too
and
after
my
wife
had
put
up
some
of
the
grapes
in
a
basket
for
to
be
sent
to
the
king
we
took
coach
and
home
were
we
found
a
hampire
of
millons
sent
to
me
also
this
morning
up
by
at
to
white
hall
to
meet
moore
at
the
privy
seale
and
there
i
heard
of
a
fray
between
the
two
embassadors
of
spaine
the
baron
de
vatteville
and
france
godfrey
count
marshal
of
france
and
viceroy
of
america
he
proved
himself
upon
many
occasions
an
able
diplomatist
and
particularly
at
the
conferences
of
nimeguen
when
acting
as
ambassador
in
ob
aet
suae
vide
his
letters
to
louis
xiv
in
the
append
and
that
this
day
being
the
day
of
the
entrance
of
an
embassador
from
sweden
they
intended
to
fight
for
the
precedence
our
king
i
heard
ordered
that
no
englishman
should
meddle
in
the
business
but
let
them
do
what
they
would
and
to
that
end
all
the
soldiers
in
the
town
were
in
arms
all
the
day
long
and
some
of
the
in
the
city
and
a
great
bustle
through
the
city
all
the
day
then
we
took
coach
which
was
the
business
i
come
for
to
chelsey
to
my
lord
privy
seale
and
there
got
him
to
seal
the
business
here
i
saw
by
two
very
fine
pictures
in
the
gallery
that
a
little
while
ago
i
saw
by
night
and
did
also
go
all
over
the
house
and
found
it
to
be
the
prettiest
contrived
house
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
so
back
again
and
at
white
hall
light
and
saw
the
soldiers
and
people
running
up
and
down
the
streets
so
i
went
to
the
spanish
embassador
and
the
french
and
there
saw
great
preparations
on
both
sides
but
the
french
made
the
most
noise
and
ranted
most
but
the
other
made
no
stir
almost
at
all
so
that
i
was
afraid
the
other
would
have
too
great
a
conquest
over
them
then
to
the
wardrobe
and
dined
there
and
then
abroad
and
in
cheapside
hear
that
the
spanish
hath
got
the
best
of
it
and
killed
three
of
the
french
and
severall
men
and
is
gone
through
the
city
next
to
our
king
coach
at
which
it
is
strange
to
see
how
all
the
city
did
rejoice
and
indeed
we
do
naturally
all
love
the
spanish
and
hate
the
french
but
i
as
i
am
in
all
things
curious
presently
got
to
the
and
there
took
oares
to
westminster
palace
and
run
after
them
through
all
the
dirt
and
the
streets
full
of
people
till
at
last
at
the
mewes
i
saw
the
spanish
coach
go
with
fifty
drawn
swords
at
least
to
guard
it
and
our
soldiers
shouting
for
joy
and
so
i
followed
the
coach
and
then
met
it
at
york
house
where
the
embassador
lies
and
there
it
went
in
with
great
state
york
house
belonged
to
the
see
of
york
till
james
time
when
toby
matthews
exchanged
it
with
the
crown
chancellors
egerton
and
bacon
resided
there
after
which
it
was
granted
to
villiers
duke
of
buckingham
subsequently
to
the
restoration
his
son
occupied
the
house
some
years
and
disposing
of
the
premises
they
were
converted
into
the
streets
still
bearing
his
names
and
the
general
appellation
of
york
buildings
so
then
i
went
to
the
french
house
where
i
observe
still
that
there
is
no
men
in
the
world
of
a
more
insolent
spirit
where
they
do
well
nor
before
they
begin
a
matter
and
more
abject
if
they
do
miscarry
than
these
people
are
for
they
all
look
like
dead
men
and
not
a
word
among
them
but
shake
their
heads
the
truth
is
the
spaniards
were
not
only
observed
to
fight
most
desperately
but
also
they
did
outwitt
them
first
in
lining
their
own
harnesse
with
chains
of
iron
that
they
could
not
be
cut
then
in
setting
their
coach
in
the
most
advantageous
place
and
to
appoint
men
to
guard
every
one
of
their
horses
and
others
for
to
guard
the
coach
and
others
the
coachmen
and
above
all
in
setting
upon
the
french
horses
and
killing
them
for
by
that
means
the
french
were
not
able
to
stir
there
were
several
men
slain
of
the
french
and
one
or
two
of
the
spaniards
and
one
englishman
by
a
bullet
which
is
very
observable
the
french
were
at
least
four
to
one
in
number
and
had
near
case
of
pistols
among
them
and
the
spaniards
had
not
one
gun
among
them
which
is
for
their
honour
for
ever
and
the
others
disgrace
so
having
been
very
much
daubed
with
dirt
i
got
a
coach
and
home
where
i
vexed
my
wife
in
telling
of
her
this
story
and
pleading
for
the
spaniards
against
the
french
so
ends
this
month
myself
and
family
in
good
condition
of
health
but
my
head
full
of
my
lord
and
my
own
and
the
office
business
where
we
are
now
very
busy
about
sending
forces
to
tangier
and
the
fleet
of
my
lord
of
sandwich
who
is
now
at
lisbone
to
bring
over
the
queene
the
business
of
argier
hath
of
late
troubled
me
because
my
lord
hath
not
done
what
he
went
for
though
he
did
as
much
as
any
man
in
the
world
could
have
done
the
want
of
money
puts
all
things
and
above
all
the
navy
out
of
order
and
yet
i
do
not
see
that
the
king
takes
care
to
bring
in
any
money
but
thinks
of
new
designs
to
lay
out
money
october
by
coach
to
white
hall
with
sir
pen
so
to
montagu
where
his
man
mons
eschar
makes
a
great
complaint
against
the
english
that
they
did
help
the
spaniards
against
the
french
the
other
day
and
that
their
embassador
do
demand
justice
of
our
king
and
that
he
do
resolve
to
be
gone
for
france
the
next
week
which
i
and
all
that
i
met
with
are
glad
of
captn
cock
a
man
of
great
observation
and
repute
did
tell
me
that
he
was
confident
that
the
parliament
when
it
comes
the
next
month
to
sit
again
would
bring
trouble
with
it
and
enquire
how
the
king
had
disposed
of
offices
and
money
before
they
will
raise
more
which
i
fear
will
bring
all
things
to
ruin
again
dined
with
captain
lambert
and
his
and
had
much
talk
of
portugall
from
whence
he
is
lately
come
and
he
tells
me
it
is
a
very
poor
dirty
place
i
mean
the
city
and
court
of
lisbone
that
the
king
is
a
very
rude
and
simple
fellow
and
for
reviling
of
somebody
a
little
while
ago
had
been
killed
had
he
not
told
them
that
he
was
their
king
that
there
are
no
glass
windows
nor
will
they
have
any
which
makes
sport
among
our
merchants
there
to
talk
of
an
english
factor
that
being
newly
come
thither
writ
into
england
that
glasse
would
be
a
good
commodity
to
send
thither
that
the
king
has
his
meat
sent
up
by
a
dozen
of
lazy
guards
and
in
pipkins
sometimes
to
his
own
table
and
sometimes
nothing
but
fruits
and
half
a
hen
and
that
now
the
infanta
is
become
our
queen
she
is
come
to
have
a
whole
hen
or
goose
to
her
table
to
white
hall
to
montagu
where
i
met
with
pierce
the
purser
to
advise
about
the
things
to
be
sent
to
my
lord
for
the
queene
provision
now
there
is
all
haste
made
for
the
fleete
going
to
sir
batten
who
is
to
go
to
portsmouth
to
wait
upon
the
duke
of
york
who
goes
to
take
possession
and
to
set
in
order
the
garrison
there
this
morning
sir
j
pen
and
i
should
have
gone
out
of
town
with
my
lady
batten
to
have
met
sir
william
coming
back
from
portsmouth
at
kingston
but
could
not
by
reason
that
my
lord
of
peterborough
who
is
to
go
governor
of
tangier
come
this
morning
henry
second
earl
of
peterborough
a
privy
councillor
and
in
made
groom
of
the
stole
he
was
also
and
died
with
sir
carteret
to
advise
with
us
about
completing
of
the
affairs
and
preparacions
for
that
place
this
place
so
often
mentioned
by
pepys
was
first
given
up
to
the
english
fleet
under
lord
sandwich
by
the
portuguese
and
lord
peterborough
left
governor
with
a
garrison
the
greatest
pains
were
afterwards
taken
to
preserve
the
fortress
and
a
fine
mole
was
constructed
at
a
vast
expense
to
improve
the
harbour
at
length
after
immense
sums
of
money
had
been
wasted
there
the
house
of
commons
expressed
a
dislike
to
the
management
of
the
garrison
which
they
suspected
to
be
a
nursery
for
a
popish
army
and
seemed
disinclined
to
maintain
it
any
longer
the
king
consequently
in
sent
lord
dartmouth
to
bring
home
the
troops
and
destroy
the
works
which
he
performed
most
effectually
and
tangier
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
moors
its
importance
having
ceased
with
the
demolition
of
the
mole
news
was
brought
that
sir
slingsby
our
comptroller
who
hath
this
day
been
sick
a
week
is
dead
which
put
me
into
so
great
a
trouble
of
mind
that
all
the
night
i
could
not
sleep
he
being
a
man
that
loved
me
and
had
many
qualitys
that
made
me
to
love
him
above
all
the
officers
and
commissioners
in
the
navy
lord
day
at
church
in
the
morning
where
in
pew
both
sir
williams
and
i
had
much
talk
about
the
death
of
sir
robert
which
troubles
me
much
and
them
in
appearance
though
i
do
not
believe
it
because
i
know
that
he
was
a
cheque
to
their
engrossing
the
whole
trade
of
the
this
day
i
put
on
my
half
cloth
black
stockings
and
my
new
coate
of
the
fashion
which
pleases
me
well
and
with
my
beaver
i
was
after
office
was
done
ready
to
go
to
my
lord
mayor
feast
as
we
are
all
invited
but
the
sir
williams
were
both
loth
to
go
because
of
the
crowd
and
so
none
of
us
went
this
lord
mayor
it
seems
brings
up
again
the
custom
of
lord
mayors
going
the
day
of
their
instalment
to
paul
and
walking
round
about
the
crosse
and
offering
something
at
the
altar
sir
henry
vane
lambert
and
others
are
lately
sent
suddenly
away
from
the
tower
prisoners
to
scilly
but
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
plot
as
is
said
but
only
a
pretence
as
there
was
once
pretended
often
against
the
cavaliers
november
sir
wm
sent
for
his
son
wm
pen
lately
come
from
oxford
the
celebrated
quaker
and
founder
of
pennsylvania
at
the
office
all
the
morning
where
sir
john
minnes
our
new
comptroller
was
fetched
by
sir
wm
pen
and
myself
from
sir
wm
batten
and
led
to
his
place
in
the
office
the
first
time
that
he
had
come
thither
and
he
seems
in
a
good
fair
condition
and
one
that
i
am
glad
hath
the
office
with
my
wife
to
the
opera
where
we
saw
the
bondman
which
of
old
we
both
did
so
doate
on
and
do
still
though
to
both
our
thinking
not
so
well
acted
here
having
too
great
expectations
as
formally
at
but
for
beterton
he
is
called
by
us
both
the
best
actor
in
the
world
thomas
betterton
the
celebrated
actor
born
in
was
the
son
of
an
under
cook
to
charles
and
first
appeared
on
the
stage
at
the
cockpit
in
drury
lane
in
after
the
restoration
two
distinct
theatres
were
established
by
royal
authority
one
in
drury
lane
called
the
king
company
under
a
patent
granted
to
killigrew
the
other
in
lincoln
inn
fields
styled
the
troop
the
patentee
of
which
was
sir
davenant
who
engaged
betterton
in
died
in
and
was
buried
in
the
cloisters
of
westminster
abbey
this
morning
up
early
and
to
my
lord
chancellor
with
a
letter
to
him
from
my
lord
and
did
speak
with
him
and
he
did
ask
me
whether
i
was
was
son
to
talbot
pepys
or
no
of
impington
great
uncle
to
our
author
with
whom
he
was
once
acquainted
in
the
court
of
requests
and
spoke
to
me
with
great
respect
at
gregory
where
i
hear
our
queene
katherine
the
first
time
by
name
publickly
prayed
for
this
day
holmes
come
to
town
and
we
do
expect
hourly
to
hear
what
usage
he
hath
from
the
duke
and
the
king
about
his
late
business
of
letting
the
swedish
embassador
go
by
him
without
striking
his
flag
by
appointment
we
all
went
this
morning
to
wait
upon
the
duke
of
york
which
we
did
in
his
chamber
as
he
was
dressing
himself
in
his
riding
suit
to
go
this
day
by
sea
to
the
downes
he
is
in
mourning
for
his
wife
grandmother
which
is
thought
a
great
piece
of
fondness
after
we
had
given
him
our
letter
relating
the
bad
condition
of
the
navy
for
want
of
money
he
referred
it
to
his
coming
back
and
so
parted
thence
on
foot
to
my
lord
crewe
here
i
was
well
received
by
my
lord
and
sir
thomas
with
whom
i
had
great
talk
and
he
tells
me
in
good
earnest
that
he
do
believe
the
parliament
which
comes
to
sit
again
the
next
week
will
be
troublesome
to
the
court
and
clergy
which
god
forbid
but
they
see
things
carried
so
by
my
lord
chancellor
and
some
others
that
get
money
themselves
that
they
will
not
endure
it
to
church
and
heard
a
simple
fellow
upon
the
praise
of
church
musique
and
exclaiming
against
men
wearing
their
hats
on
in
the
church
to
westminster
hall
by
water
in
the
morning
where
i
saw
the
king
going
in
his
barge
to
the
parliament
house
this
being
the
first
day
of
their
meeting
again
and
the
bishops
i
hear
do
take
their
places
is
the
lords
house
this
day
i
walked
longe
in
the
hall
but
hear
nothing
of
newes
but
what
ned
pickering
tells
me
which
i
am
troubled
at
that
sir
minnes
should
send
word
to
the
king
that
if
he
did
not
remove
all
my
lord
sandwich
captains
out
of
this
fleet
he
believed
the
king
would
not
be
master
of
the
fleet
at
its
coming
again
and
so
do
endeavour
to
bring
disgrace
upon
my
lord
but
i
hope
all
that
will
not
do
for
the
king
loves
him
at
the
office
all
the
afternoon
it
being
the
first
afternoon
that
we
have
sat
which
we
are
now
to
do
always
so
long
as
the
parliament
sits
who
this
day
have
voted
the
king
to
be
raised
to
pay
his
debts
according
to
the
journals
letters
from
my
lord
sandwich
from
tangier
where
he
continues
still
and
hath
done
some
execution
upon
the
turks
and
retaken
an
englishman
from
them
one
parker
a
merchant
in
i
lay
long
in
bed
till
sir
williams
both
sent
me
word
that
we
were
to
wait
upon
the
duke
of
york
and
that
they
would
have
me
to
meet
them
at
westminster
hall
at
noon
so
i
rose
and
went
thither
and
there
i
understand
that
they
are
gone
to
coventry
lodgings
in
the
old
palace
yard
to
dinner
the
first
time
that
i
knew
he
had
any
and
there
i
met
them
and
sir
carteret
and
had
a
very
fine
dinner
and
good
welcome
and
discourse
and
so
by
water
after
dinner
to
white
hall
to
the
duke
who
met
us
in
his
closet
and
there
did
discourse
upon
the
business
of
holmes
and
did
desire
of
us
to
know
what
hath
been
the
common
practice
about
making
of
forrayne
ships
to
strike
sail
to
us
which
they
did
all
do
as
much
as
they
could
but
i
could
say
nothing
to
it
which
i
was
sorry
for
after
we
were
gone
from
the
duke
i
told
coventry
that
i
had
heard
selden
often
say
that
he
could
prove
that
in
henry
the
time
he
did
give
commission
to
his
captains
to
make
the
king
of
denmark
ships
to
strike
to
him
in
the
baltique
this
is
the
last
day
for
the
old
state
coyne
to
pass
in
common
payments
but
they
say
it
is
to
pass
in
publique
payments
to
the
king
three
months
still
december
there
hath
lately
been
great
clapping
up
of
some
old
statesmen
such
as
ireton
moyer
samuel
moyer
one
of
the
council
of
state
and
others
and
they
say
upon
a
great
plot
but
i
believe
no
such
thing
but
it
is
but
justice
that
they
should
be
served
as
they
served
the
poor
cavaliers
and
i
believe
it
will
oftentimes
be
so
as
long
as
they
live
whether
there
be
cause
or
no
to
white
hall
where
at
sir
carteret
sir
williams
both
and
i
dined
very
pleasantly
and
after
dinner
by
appointment
came
the
governors
of
the
east
india
company
to
sign
and
seal
the
contract
between
us
in
the
king
name
and
them
and
that
done
we
all
went
to
the
king
closet
and
there
spoke
with
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
who
promise
to
be
very
careful
of
the
india
trade
to
the
utmost
to
the
privy
seale
and
sealed
there
and
among
other
things
that
passed
there
was
a
patent
for
roger
palmer
madam
palmer
husband
ob
july
to
be
earle
of
castlemaine
and
baron
of
limbricke
in
ireland
but
the
honor
is
tied
up
to
the
males
got
of
the
body
of
this
wife
the
lady
barbary
the
reason
whereof
every
body
knows
that
done
by
water
to
the
office
where
i
found
sir
pen
and
with
him
captn
holmes
who
had
wrote
his
case
and
gives
me
a
copy
as
he
hath
many
among
his
friends
and
presented
the
same
to
the
king
and
council
which
i
have
made
use
of
in
my
attempt
of
writing
something
concerning
the
business
of
striking
sail
which
i
am
now
about
but
he
do
cry
out
against
sir
john
minnes
as
the
veriest
knave
and
rogue
and
coward
in
the
world
at
noon
to
dinner
at
the
wardrobe
where
my
lady
wright
was
who
did
talk
much
upon
the
worth
and
the
desert
of
gallantry
and
that
there
was
none
fit
to
be
courtiers
but
such
as
have
been
abroad
and
know
fashions
see
note
on
sir
harry
wright
march
which
i
endeavoured
to
oppose
and
was
troubled
to
hear
her
talk
so
though
she
be
a
very
wise
and
discreet
lady
in
other
things
i
am
now
full
of
study
about
writing
something
about
our
making
of
strangers
strike
to
us
at
sea
and
so
am
altogether
reading
selden
and
grotius
and
such
other
authors
to
that
purpose
after
dinner
to
the
opera
where
there
was
a
new
play
cutter
of
coleman
street
made
in
the
year
with
reflections
much
upon
the
late
times
and
it
being
the
first
time
the
pay
was
doubled
and
so
to
save
money
my
wife
and
i
went
into
the
gallery
and
there
sat
and
saw
very
well
and
a
very
good
play
it
is
it
seems
of
cowly
making
to
white
hall
to
the
privy
seale
as
my
lord
privy
seale
did
tell
me
he
could
seale
no
more
this
month
for
he
goes
thirty
miles
out
of
towne
to
keep
his
christmas
at
which
i
was
glad
but
only
afraid
lest
any
thing
of
the
king
should
force
as
to
go
after
him
to
get
a
seale
in
the
country
i
spoke
to
falconberge
to
look
whether
he
could
out
of
domesday
book
give
me
any
thing
concerning
the
sea
and
the
dominion
thereof
which
he
says
he
will
look
after
in
the
morning
to
my
bookseller
to
bespeak
a
thesaurus
for
which
i
offer
to
give
to
paul
school
and
from
thence
to
paul
church
and
there
i
did
hear
gunning
preach
a
good
sermon
upon
the
day
being
john
day
and
did
hear
him
tell
a
story
which
he
did
persuade
us
to
believe
to
be
true
that
john
and
the
virgin
mary
did
appear
to
gregory
a
bishopp
at
his
prayer
to
be
confirmed
in
the
faith
which
i
did
wonder
to
hear
from
him
at
home
all
the
morning
and
in
the
afternoon
all
of
us
at
the
office
upon
a
letter
from
the
duke
for
the
making
up
of
a
speedy
estimate
of
all
the
debts
of
the
navy
which
is
put
into
good
forwardness
to
the
office
and
there
late
finishing
our
estimate
of
the
debts
of
the
navy
to
this
day
and
it
come
to
near
i
suppose
myself
to
be
worth
about
clear
in
the
world
and
my
goods
of
my
house
my
owne
and
what
is
coming
to
me

but
by
my
uncle

the
whole
care
and
trouble
and
settling
of

upon
me

is
very
great
because
of

the
two
years
are
out
and
another
is
chose
a
messenger
is
sent
to
him
who
stands
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
and
he
at
the
top
and
says
illustrissima
serenita
sta
finita
et
puede
andar
en
casa
your
serenity
is
now
ended
and
now
you
may
be
going
home
and
so
claps
on
his
hat
and
the
old
duke
having
by
custom
sent
his
goods
home
before
walks
away
it
may
be
but
with
one
man
at
his
heels
and
the
new
one
brought
immediately
in
his
room
in
the
greatest
state
in
the
world
another
account
was
told
us
how
in
the
dukedom
of
ragusa
in
the
adriatique
a
state
that
is
little
but
more
ancient
they
say
than
venice
and
is
called
the
mother
of
venice
and
the
turkes
lie
round
about
it
that
they
change
all
the
officers
of
their
guard
for
fear
of
conspiracy
every
hours
so
that
nobody
knows
who
shall
be
captain
of
the
guard
but
two
men
come
to
a
man
and
lay
hold
of
him
as
a
prisoner
and
carry
him
to
the
place
and
there
he
hath
the
keys
of
the
garrison
given
him
and
he
presently
issues
his
orders
for
that
night
watch
and
so
always
from
night
to
night
sir
wm
rider
told
the
first
of
his
own
knowledge
and
both
he
and
sir
batten
confirm
the
last
before

and
the
dean
michael
honywood
installed
dean
of
lincoln
ob
aged
and
colonel
honiwood
brothers
to
dine
with
me
but
so
soon
that
i
was
troubled
at
it
peter
did
show
us
the
experiment
which
i
had
heard
talke
of
of
the
chymicall
glasses
which
break
all
to
dust
by
breaking
off
a
little
small
end
which
is
a
great
mystery
to
me
berkenshaw
pepys
music
master
asked
me
whether
we
had
not
committed
a
fault
in
eating
telling
me
that
it
is
a
fast
day
ordered
by
the
parliament
to
pray
for
more
seasonable
weather
it
having
hitherto
been
summer
weather
that
it
is
both
as
to
warmth
and
every
other
thing
just
as
if
it
were
the
middle
of
may
or
june
which
do
threaten
a
plague
as
all
men
think
to
follow
for
so
it
was
almost
the
last
winter
and
the
whole
year
after
hath
been
a
very
sickly
time
to
this
day
towards
cheapside
and
in
paul
saw
the
funeral
of
my
lord
cornwallis
late
steward
of
the
king
house
go
by
stoakes
told
us
that
notwithstanding
the
country
of
gambo
is
so
unhealthy
yet
the
people
of
the
place
live
very
long
so
as
the
present
king
there
is
years
old
which
they
count
by
rains
because
every
year
it
rains
continually
four
months
together
he
also
told
us
that
the
kings
there
have
above
wives
comes
moore
to
give
me
an
account
how
montagu
edward
montagu
was
gone
away
of
a
sudden
with
the
fleet
in
such
haste
that
he
hath
left
behind
some
servants
and
many
things
of
consequence
and
among
others
my
lord
commission
for
embassador
whereupon
he
and
i
took
coach
and
to
whitehall
to
my
lord
lodgings
to
have
spoke
with
ralph
montagu
ralph
eldest
son
of
edward
second
baron
montagu
of
boughton
created
duke
of
montagu
and
died
his
sister
elizabeth
had
married
sir
harvey
ambassador
to
constantinople
his
brother
and
here
we
staid
talking
with
sarah
and
the
old
man
but
by
and
by
hearing
that
he
was
in
covent
garden
we
went
thither
and
at
my
lady
harvy
his
sister
i
spoke
with
him
and
he
tells
me
that
the
commission
is
not
left
behind
after
to
white
hall
and
thence
to
westminster
in
my
way
calling
at
george
montagu
to
condole
on
the
loss
of
his
son
who
was
a
fine
gentleman
after
this
discourse
he
told
me
among
other
news
the
great
jealousys
that
are
now
in
the
parliament
house
the
lord
chancellor
it
seems
taking
occasion
from
this
late
plot
to
raise
fears
in
the
people
did
project
the
raising
of
an
army
forthwith
besides
the
constant
militia
thinking
to
make
the
duke
of
york
general
thereof
but
the
house
did
in
very
open
termes
say
they
were
grown
too
wise
to
be
fooled
again
into
another
army
and
said
they
had
found
how
that
man
that
hath
the
command
of
an
army
is
not
beholden
to
any
body
to
make
him
king
there
are
factions
private
ones
at
court
about
madam
palmer
but
what
it
is
about
i
know
not
but
it
is
something
about
the
king
favour
to
her
now
that
the
queene
is
coming
he
told
me
too
what
sport
the
king
and
court
do
make
at
edwd
montagu
leaving
his
things
behind
him
but
the
chancellor
taking
it
a
little
more
seriously
did
openly
say
to
my
lord
chamberlaine
that
had
it
been
such
a
gallant
as
my
lord
mandeville
his
son
lord
mandeville
was
a
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
to
charles
ii
he
became
earl
of
manchester
on
his
father
death
and
died
at
paris
in
it
might
have
been
taken
as
a
frolique
but
for
him
that
would
be
thought
a
grave
coxcombe
it
was
very
strange
thence
to
the
hall
where
i
heard
the
house
had
ordered
all
the
king
murderers
that
remain
to
be
executed
but
fleetwood
charles
son
of
sir
wm
fleetwood
general
and
commander
in
chief
to
the
protector
richard
whose
sister
bridget
widow
of
ireton
he
had
married
after
the
king
return
he
lived
in
contemptible
obscurity
and
died
circa
and
downes
at
home
and
the
office
all
the
morning
walking
in
the
garden
to
give
the
gardener
directions
what
to
do
this
year
for
i
intend
to
have
the
garden
handsome
sir
pen
come
to
me
and
did
break
a
business
to
me
about
removing
his
son
from
oxford
to
cambridge
to
some
private
college
i
proposed
magdalene
but
can
not
name
a
tutor
at
present
but
i
shall
think
and
write
about
it
thence
with
him
to
the
to
dinner
where
sir
richd
brown
one
of
the
clerkes
of
the

much
concerned

iv
p
in
the
king
lands
about
deptford
to
be
a
to
hold

of
ships
but
the
ground

seems
was
long
since
given
by
the
king
to
sir
richard
after
the
men
had
done
their
business
the
master
sir
wm

good
way

of
sir

by

none

subscribed

and
sir
mildmay
sir
mildmay
had
enjoyed
the
confidence
of
charles
who
made
him
master
of
the
jewels
but
he
sat
a
few
days
as
one
of
the
king
judges
he
died
at
antwerp
and
another
to
the
gallows
and
back
again
with
ropes
about
their
necks
which
is
to
be
repeated
every
year
this
being
the
day
of
their
sentencing
the
king
february
this
morning
with
commissioner
pett
to
the
office
and
he
staid
there
writing
while
i
and
sir
pen
walked
in
the
garden
talking
about
his
business
of
putting
his
son
to
cambridge
and
to
that
end
i
intend
to
write
to
fairebrother
to
give
me
an
account
of
burton
hezekiah
burton
b
of
magdalene
thence
with
pett
to
the
paynter
and
he
likes
our
pictures
very
well
and
so
do
thence
he
and
i
to
the
countesse
of
sandwich
to
lead
him
to
her
to
kiss
her
hands
and
dined
with
her
and
told
her
the
news
which
sir
pen
told
me
to
do
that
expresse
is
come
from
my
lord
with
letters
that
by
a
great
storm
and
tempest
the
mole
of
argier
is
broken
down
and
many
of
their
ships
sunk
into
the
mole
so
that
god
almighty
hath
now
ended
that
unlucky
business
for
us
which
is
very
good
news
to
westminster
hall
where
it
was
full
terme
here
all
the
morning
and
at
noon
to
my
lord
crewe
where
one
templer
an
ingenious
man
and
a
person
of
honour
he
seems
to
be
dined
and
discoursing
of
the
nature
of
serpents
he
told
us
some
in
the
waste
places
of
lancashire
do
grow
to
a
great
bigness
and
do
feed
upon
larkes
which
they
take
thus
they
observe
when
the
lark
is
soared
to
the
highest
and
do
crawl
till
they
come
to
be
just
underneath
them
and
there
they
place
themselves
with
their
mouth
uppermost
and
there
as
is
conceived
they
do
eject
poyson
upon
the
bird
for
the
bird
do
suddenly
come
down
again
in
its
course
of
a
circle
and
falls
directly
into
the
mouth
of
the
serpent
which
is
very
strange
he
is
a
great
traveller
and
speaking
of
the
tarantula
he
says
that
all
the
harvest
long
about
which
times
they
are
most
busy
there
are
fidlers
go
up
and
down
the
fields
every
where
in
expectation
of
being
hired
by
those
that
are
stung
this
afternoon
going
into
the
office
one
met
me
and
did
serve
a
subpoena
upon
me
for
one
field
whom
we
did
commit
to
prison
the
other
day
for
some
ill
words
he
did
give
the
office
the
like
he
had
for
others
but
we
shall
scoure
him
for
it
to
the
playhouse
and
there
saw
rule
a
wife
and
have
a
wife
a
comedy
by
j
fletcher
very
well
done
and
here
also
i
did
look
long
upon
my
lady
castlemaine
who
notwithstanding
her
sickness
continues
a
great
beauty
i
hear
the
prisoners
in
the
tower
that
are
to
die
are
come
to
the
this
morning
to
the
wardrobe
to
dinner
with
my
lady
where
a
civitt
cat
parrot
apes
and
many
other
things
are
come
from
my
lord
by
captain
hill
who
dined
with
my
lady
with
us
thence
to
the
paynter
and
am
well
pleased
with
our
pictures
to
paul
and
there
i
met
with
england
worthys
the
first
time
that
i
ever
saw
it
and
so
i
sat
down
reading
in
it
being
much
troubled
that
though
he
had
some
discourse
with
me
about
my
family
and
armes
he
says
nothing
at
all
nor
mentions
us
either
in
cambridgeshire
or
norfolke
but
i
believe
indeed
our
family
were
never
considerable
blackburne
do
tell
me
plain
of
the
corruption
of
all
our
treasurer
officers
and
that
they
hardly
pay
any
money
under
ten
per
cent
and
that
the
other
day
for
a
mere
assignation
of
to
some
counties
they
took
which
is
very
strange
last
night
died
the
queene
of
bohemia
with
the
two
sir
williams
to
the
and
there
in
their
society
had
the
business
debated
of
sir
nicholas
sasse
at
deptford
after
dinner
i
was
sworn
a
younger
brother
sir
rider
being
for
my
lord
of
sandwich
and
after
i
was
sworn
all
the
elder
brothers
shake
me
by
the
hand
it
is
their
custom
it
seems
no
news
yet
of
our
fleet
gone
to
tangier
which
we
now
begin
to
think
long
this
morning
both
sir
williams
myself
and
captn
cock
and
captn
tinker
of
the
covertine
which
we
are
going
to
look
upon
being
intended
with
these
ships
fitting
for
the
east
indys
down
to
deptford
and
thence
after
being
on
to
woolwich
and
there
eat
something
the
sir
williams
being
unwilling
to
eat
flesh
captn
cock
and
i
had
a
breast
of
veale
roasted
having
agreed
with
sir
wm
pen
to
meet
him
at
the
opera
and
finding
by
my
walking
in
the
streets
which
were
every
where
full
of
and
tyles
flung
down
by
the
extraordinary
winde
the
last
night
such
as
hath
not
been
in
memory
before
unless
at
the
death
of
the
late
protector
that
it
was
dangerous
to
go
out
of
doors
and
hearing
how
several
persons
had
been
killed
by
the
fall
of
things
in
the
streets
and
that
the
pageant
in
is
most
of
it
blown
down
and
hath
broke
down
part
of
several
houses
among
others
dick
brigden
and
that
one
lady
sanderson
a
person
of
quality
in
was
killed
by
the
fall
of
the
house
in
her
bed
last
night
i
sent
my
boy
to
forbid
him
to
go
forth
but
he
bringing
me
word
that
he
is
gone
i
went
thither
and
saw
the
law
against
lovers
a
by
sir
william
davenant
taken
from
measure
for
measure
and
much
ado
about
nothing
a
good
play
and
well
performed
especially
the
little
girl
whom
i
never
saw
act
before
dancing
and
singing
and
were
it
not
for
her
the
losse
of
roxalana
would
spoil
the
house
letters
from
tangier
from
my
lord
telling
me
how
upon
a
great
defete
given
to
the
portuguese
there
by
the
moors
he
had
put
in
men
into
the
towne
and
so
he
is
in
possession
of
which
we
are
very
glad
because
now
the
spaniards
designs
of
hindering
our
getting
the
place
are
frustrated
i
went
with
the
letter
inclosed
to
my
lord
chancellor
to
the
house
of
lords
and
did
give
it
him
in
the
house
went
by
promise
to
savill
and
there
sat
the
first
time
for
my
picture
in
little
which
pleaseth
me
well
this
evening
i
wrote
letters
to
my
father
among
other
things
acquainted
him
with
the
unhappy
accident
which
hath
happened
lately
to
my
lord
of
dorset
two
oldest
sons
who
with
two
belasses
and
one
squire
wentworth
were
lately
apprehended
for
killing
and
robbing
of
a
tanner
about
newington
on
wednesday
last
and
are
all
now
in
newgate
i
am
much
troubled
for
it
and
for
the
grief
and
disgrace
it
brings
to
their
familys
and
friends
the
following
account
of
this
transaction
is
abridged
from
the
mercurius
publicus
of
the
day
charles
lord
brockhurst
edward
sackville
his
brother
sir
henry
belasyse
eldest
son
of
lord
belasyse
john
belasyse
brother
to
lord
faulconberg
and
thomas
wentworth
only
son
of
sir
wentworth
whilst
in
pursuit
of
thieves
near
waltham
cross
mortally
wounded
an
innocent
tanner
named
hoppy
whom
they
had
endeavoured
to
secure
suspecting
him
to
have
been
one
of
the
robbers
and
as
they
took
away
the
money
found
on
his
person
under
the
idea
that
it
was
stolen
property
they
were
soon
after
apprehended
on
the
charges
of
robbery
and
murder
but
the
grand
jury
found
a
bill
for
manslaughter
only
by
a
subsequent
allusion
in
the
diary
to
their
trial
it
seems
probable
that
a
verdict
of
acquittal
was
pronounced
this
day
by
god
mercy
i
am
years
of
age
and
in
very
good
health
and
like
to
live
and
get
an
estate
and
if
i
have
a
heart
to
be
contented
i
think
i
may
reckon
myself
as
happy
a
man
as
any
in
the
world
for
which
god
be
praised
so
to
prayers
and
to
bed
great
talk
of
the
effects
of
this
late
great
wind
and
i
heard
one
say
that
he
had
five
great
trees
standing
together
blown
down
and
beginning
to
lop
them
one
of
them
as
soon
as
the
lops
were
cut
off
did
by
the
weight
of
the
root
rise
again
and
fasten
we
have
letters
from
the
forest
of
deane
that
above
oakes
and
as
many
beeches
are
blown
down
in
one
walke
there
and
letters
from
my
father
tell
me
of
hurt
done
to
us
at
brampton
this
day
in
the
i
find
that
my
lord
buckhurst
charles
lord
buckhurst
eldest
son
of
richard
fifth
earl
of
dorset
created
earl
of
middlesex
soon
after
his
death
in
and
succeeded
his
father
in
ob
and
his
fellows
have
printed
their
case
as
they
did
give
it
in
upon
examination
to
a
justice
of
peace
wherein
they
make
themselves
a
very
good
tale
that
they
were
in
pursuit
of
thieves
and
that
they
took
this
man
for
one
of
them
and
so
killed
him
and
that
he
himself
confessed
it
was
the
first
time
of
his
robbing
and
that
he
did
pay
dearly
for
it
for
he
was
a
dead
man
but
i
doubt
things
will
be
proved
otherwise
than
they
say
march
to
the
opera
and
there
saw
romeo
and
juliet
the
first
time
it
was
ever
acted
i
am
resolved
to
go
no
more
to
see
the
first
time
of
acting
for
they
were
all
of
them
out
more
or
less
i
am
told
that
this
day
the
parliament
hath
voted
per
annum
for
every
chimney
in
england
as
a
constant
revenue
for
ever
to
the
crowne
early
to
white
hall
to
the
chapel
where
by
means
i
got
into
his
pew
and
heard
creeton
the
great
scotchman
and
chaplain
in
ordinary
to
the
king
preach
before
the
king
and
duke
and
duchesse
upon
the
words
of
micah
roule
yourselves
in
dust
he
made
a
most
learned
sermon
upon
the
words
but
in
his
application
the
most
comical
man
that
ever
i
heard
in
my
life
just
such
a
man
as
hugh
peters
saying
that
it
had
been
better
for
the
poor
cavalier
never
to
have
come
with
the
king
into
england
again
for
he
that
hath
the
impudence
to
deny
obedience
to
the
lawful
magistrate
and
to
swear
to
the
oath
of
allegiance
was
better
treated
in
newgate
than
a
poor
royalist
that
hath
suffered
all
his
life
for
the
king
is
at
white
hall
among
his
friends
by
coach
with
both
sir
williams
to
westminster
this
being
a
great
day
there
in
the
house
to
pass
the
business
for
money
which
was
done
in
the
hall
i
met
with
surgeon
pierce
and
he
told
me
how
my
lady
monk
hath
disposed
of
all
the
places
which
edwd
montagu
hoped
to
have
had
as
he
was
master
of
the
horse
to
the
queene
which
i
am
afraid
will
undo
him
because
he
depended
much
upon
the
profit
of
what
he
should
make
by
these
places
he
told
me
also
many
more
scurvy
stories
of
him
and
his
brother
ralph
which
troubles
me
to
hear
of
persons
of
honour
as
they
are
sir
pen
and
i
to
the
office
whither
afterward
come
sir
carteret
and
we
sent
for
sir
thos
allen
one
of
the
aldermen
of
the
city
probably
sheriff
of
london
about
the
business
of
one
colonel
appesly
whom
we
had
taken
counterfeiting
of
bills
with
all
our
hands
and
the
officers
of
the
yards
so
well
that
i
should
never
have
mistrusted
them
we
staid
about
this
business
at
the
office
till
ten
at
night
and
at
last
did
send
him
with
a
constable
to
the
counter
and
did
give
warrants
for
the
seizing
of
a
complice
of
his
one
blenkinsopp
this
morning
we
had
news
from
coventry
that
sir
downing
like
a
perfidious
rogue
though
the
action
is
good
and
of
service
to
the
king
yet
he
can
not
with
a
good
conscience
do
it
hath
taken
okey
corbet
and
barkestead
at
delfe
in
holland
and
sent
them
home
in
the
blackmore
according
to
hume
downing
had
once
been
chaplain
to
okey
regiment
john
okey
miles
corbet
and
john
barkstead
three
of
the
regicides
executed
april
following
sir
pen
talking
to
me
this
afternoon
of
what
a
strange
thing
it
is
for
downing
to
do
this
he
told
me
of
a
speech
he
made
to
the
lords
states
of
holland
telling
them
to
their
faces
that
he
observed
that
he
was
not
received
with
the
respect
and
observance
now
that
he
was
when
he
came
from
the
traitor
and
rebell
cromwell
by
whom
i
am
sure
he
hath
got
all
he
hath
in
the
world
and
they
know
it
too
home
to
dinner
in
the
afternoon
come
the
german
knuffler
to
discourse
with
us
about
his
engine
to
blow
up
ships
we
doubted
not
the
matter
of
fact
it
being
tried
in
time
but
the
safety
of
carrying
them
in
ships
but
he
do
tell
us
that
when
he
comes
to
tell
the
king
his
secret
for
none
but
the
kings
successively
and
their
heirs
must
know
it
it
will
appear
to
be
of
no
danger
at
all
we
concluded
nothing
but
shall
discourse
with
the
duke
of
york
about
it
walked
to
white
hall
and
an
houre
or
two
in
the
parke
which
is
now
very
pleasant
here
the
king
and
duke
come
to
see
their
fowle
play
the
duke
took
very
civil
notice
of
me
last
night
the
blackmore
pinke
brought
the
three
prisoners
barkestead
okey
and
corbet
to
the
tower
being
taken
at
delfe
in
holland
where
the
captain
tells
me
the
dutch
were
a
good
while
before
they
could
be
persuaded
to
let
them
go
they
being
taken
prisoners
in
their
land
but
sir
downing
would
not
be
answered
so
though
all
the
world
takes
notice
of
him
for
a
most
ungrateful
villaine
for
his
pains
to
westminster
hall
and
there
walked
up
and
down
and
heard
the
great
difference
that
hath
been
between
my
lord
chancellor
and
my
lord
of
bristol
about
a
proviso
that
my
lord
chancellor
would
have
brought
into
the
bill
for
conformity
that
it
shall
be
in
the
power
of
the
king
when
he
sees
fit
to
dispense
with
the
act
of
conformity
and
though
it
be
carried
in
the
house
of
lords
yet
it
is
believed
it
will
hardly
pass
in
the
commons
to
white
hall
and
there
met
with
captn
isham
this
day
come
from
lisbone
with
letters
from
the
queene
to
the
king
and
he
did
give
me
letters
which
speak
that
our
fleet
is
all
at
lisbone
and
that
the
queene
do
not
intend
to
embarque
sooner
than
come
fortnight
by
and
by
comes
la
belle
pierce
to
see
my
wife
and
to
bring
her
a
pair
of
peruques
of
hair
as
the
fashion
now
is
for
ladies
to
wear
which
are
pretty
and
are
of
my
wife
own
hair
or
else
i
should
not
endure
them
april
lord
day
by
water
to
white
hall
to
sir
carteret
to
give
him
an
account
of
the
backwardnesse
of
the
ships
we
have
hired
to
portugall
at
which
he
is
much
troubled
thence
to
the
chapel
and
there
though
crowded
heard
a
very
honest
sermon
before
the
king
by
a
canon
of
christ
church
upon
these
words
having
a
form
of
godlinesse
but
denying
among
other
things
he
did
much
insist
upon
the
sin
of
adultery
which
methought
might
touch
the
king
and
the
more
because
he
forced
it
into
his
sermon
besides
his
text
so
up
and
saw
the
king
at
dinner
and
thence
with
sir
carteret
to
his
lodgings
to
dinner
with
him
and
his
lady
all
their
discount
which
was
very
much
was
upon
their
sufferings
and
services
for
the
king
yet
not
without
some
trouble
to
see
that
some
that
had
been
much
bound
to
them
do
now
neglect
them
and
others
again
most
civil
that
have
received
least
from
them
and
i
do
believe
that
he
hath
been
a
good
servant
to
the
king
thence
to
the
parke
where
the
king
and
duke
did
walk
to
the
lords
house
and
stood
within
the
house
while
the
bishops
and
lords
did
stay
till
the
chancellor
coming
and
then
we
were
put
out
i
sent
in
a
note
to
my
lord
privy
seale
and
he
come
out
to
me
and
i
desired
he
would
make
another
deputy
for
me
because
of
my
great
business
of
the
navy
this
month
but
he
told
me
he
could
not
do
it
without
the
king
consent
which
vexed
me
the
great
talk
is
that
the
spaniards
and
the
hollanders
do
intend
to
set
upon
the
portugais
by
sea
at
lisbone
as
soon
as
our
fleet
is
come
away
and
by
that
means
our
fleet
is
not
likely
to
come
yet
these
two
months
or
three
which
i
hope
is
not
true
sir
george
carteret
showed
me
an
account
in
french
of
the
great
famine
which
is
to
the
greatest
extremity
in
some
part
of
france
at
this
day
which
is
very
strange
yesterday
come

with
letters
from
portugall
that
the

to
embarque
for
england
this
week
thence
to

my

and
to
take

going
to

to
greenwich
and
had
a
fine
pleasant
walk
to
woolwich
having
in
our
company
captn
minnes
whom
i
was
much
pleased
to
hear
talk
among
other
things
he
and
the
captains
that
were
with
us
told
me
that
negroes
drowned
looked
white
and
lose
their
blackness
which
i
never
heard
before
at
woolwich
up
and
down
to
do
the
same
business
and
so
back
to
greenwich
by
water
sir
william
and
i
walked
into
the
parke
where
the
king
hath
planted
trees
and
made
steps
in
the
hill
up
to
the
castle
which
is
very
magnificent
so
up
and
down
the
house
which
is
now
repayring
in
the
queens
lodgings
to
grayes
inn
walkes
and
there
met
pickering
his
discourse
most
about
the
pride
of
the
duchesse
of
york
and
how
all
the
ladies
envy
my
lady
castlemaine
he
intends
to
go
to
portsmouth
to
meet
the

which
is
now
the
discourse
and
expectation
of
the
towne
with
my
wife
by
coach
to
the
new
exchange
to
buy
her
some
things
where
we
saw
some
pettycoats
of
sarcenett
with
a
black
broad
lace
printed
round
the
bottom
and
before
very
handsome
and
my
wife
had
a
mind
to
one
of
them
this
morning
before
we
sat
i
went
to
aldgate
and
at
the
corner
shop
a
draper
i
stood
and
did
see
barkestead
okey
and
corbet
drawne
towards
the
gallows
at
tyburne
and
there
they
were
hanged
and
quartered
they
all
looked
very
cheerful
but
i
hear
they
all
die
defending
what
they
did
to
the
king
to
be
just
which
is
very
strange
my
intention
being
to
go
this
morning
to
white
hall
to
hear
louth
my
lord
chancellor
chaplain
the
famous
preacher
and
oratour
of
oxford
who
the
last
did
sink
down
in
the
pulpit
before
the
king
and
could
not
proceed
it
did
rain
and
the
wind
against
me
that
i
could
by
no
means
get
a
boat
or
coach
to
carry
me
and
so
i
staid
at
paul
where
the
judges
did
all
meet
and
heard
a
sermon
it
being
the
first
sunday
of
the
terme
but
they
had
a
very
poor
sermon
at
noon
dined
with
my
lord
crewe
and
after
dinner
went
up
to
sir
thos
crewe
chamber
who
is
still
ill
he
tells
me
how
my
lady
duchesse
of
richmond
mary
daughter
to
george
duke
of
buckingham

of
james
fourth
duke
of

third
duke
of
richmond
and
castlemaine
had
a
falling
out
the
other
day
and
she
calls
the
latter
jane
shore
and
did
hope
to
see
her
come
to
the
same
end
coming
down
again
to
my
lord
he
told
me
that
news
was
come
that
the
queene
is
landed
at
which
i
took
leave
and
by
coach
hurried
to
white
hall
the
bells
ringing
in
several
places
but
i
found
there
no
such
matter
nor
anything
like
it
we
come
to
gilford
up
early
and
to
petersfield
and
thence
got
a
countryman
to
guide
us
by
havant
to
avoid
going
through
the
forest
but
he
carried
us
much
out
of
the
way
i
lay
at
wiard
the
chyrurgeon
in

of
us
to

not
so
much
as
i
expected
here

had
a
very
good
sermon
upon
this
text
in
love
serving
one
another
which
pleased
me
very
well
no
news
of
the
queene
at
all
so
to
dinner
and
then
to
the
pay
all
the

a
visit
the
first
time
to
my
lady

by
coach
and
going
to
hide

was
resolved
to
follow
them
and
so
went
to

thence
at
the
theatre
where
i
saw
the
last
act
of
the
knight
of
the
burning
pestle
a
comedy
by
beaumont
and
fletcher
which
pleased
me
not
at
all
and
so
after
the
play
done
she
and
the
turner
and
lucin
and
i
in
her
coach
to
the
parke
and
there
found
them
out
and
spoke
to
them
and
observed
many
fine
ladies
and
staid
till
all
were
gone
almost
sir
carteret
told
me
that
the
queene
and
the
fleet
were
in
mount
bay
on
monday
last
and
that
the
queene
endures
her
sickness
pretty
well
he
also
told
me
how
sir
john
lawson
hath
done
some
execution
upon
the
turkes
in
the
straight
of
which
i
was
glad
and
told
the
news
the
first
on
the
exchange
and
was
much
followed
by
merchants
to
tell
it
sir
carteret
among
other
discourse
tells
me
that
it
is
coventry
that
is
to
come
to
us
as
a
commissioner
of
the
navy
at
which
he
is
much
vexed
and
cries
out
upon
sir
pen
and
threatens
him
highly
and
looking
upon
his
lodgings
which
are
now
enlarging
he
in
a
passion
cried
guarda
mi
spada
for
by
god
i
may
chance
to
keep
him
in
ireland
when
he
is
there
for
sir
pen
is
going
thither
with
my
lord
lieutenant
but
it
is
my
design
to
keep
much
in
with
sir
george
and
i
think
i
have
begun
very
well
towards
it
the
duke
of
york
went
last
night
to
portsmouth
so
that
i
believe
the
queene
is
near
at
noon
to
the
wardrobe
there
dined
my
lady
told
me
how
my
lady
castlemaine
do
speak
of
going
to
lie
at
hampton
court
which
she
and
all
our
ladies
are
much
troubled
at
because
of
the
king
being
forced
to
show
her
countenance
in
the
sight
of
the
queene
when
she
comes
in
the
evening
sir
carteret
and
i
did
hire
a
ship
for
tangier
and
other
things
together
and
i
find
that
he
do
single
me
out
to
join
with
me
apart
from
the
rest
which
i
am
much
glad
of
in
the
afternoon
to
white
hall
and
there
walked
an
houre
or
two
in
the
parke
where
i
saw
the
king
now
out
of
mourning
in
a
suit
laced
with
gold
and
silver
which
it
is
said
was
out
of
fashion
thence
to
the
wardrobe
and
there
consulted
with
the
ladies
about
going
to
hampton
court
townsend
called
us
up
by
four
and
by
five
the
three
ladies
my
wife
and
i
and
townsend
his
son
and
daughter
were
got
to
the
barge
and
set
out
we
walked
from
mortlake
to
richmond
and
so
to
boat
again
and
from
teddington
to
hampton
court
townsend
and
i
walked
again
and
then
met
the
ladies
and
were
showed
the
whole
house
by
marriott
which
is
indeed
nobly
furnished
particularly
the
queene
bed
given
her
by
the
states
of
holland
a
sent
by
the
from
france
hanging
in
the
queene
chamber
and
many
brave
pictures
and
so
to
barge
again
and
got
home
about
eight
at
night
very
well
dined
at
the
wardrobe
and
after
dinner
sat
talking
an
hour
or
two
alone
with
my
lady
she
is
afraid
that
my
lady
castlemaine
will
keep
still
with
the
king
to
westminster
and
at
the
privy
seale
i
saw
coventry
seal
for
his
being
commissioner
with
us
at
night
all
the
bells
of
the
towne
rung
and
bonfires
made
for
the
joy
of
the
queene
arrival
who
landed
at
portsmouth
last
night
but
i
do
not
see
much
true
joy
but
only
an
indifferent
one
in
the
hearts
of
the
people
who
are
much
discontented
at
the
pride
and
luxury
of
the
court
and
running
in
debt
whitsunday
by
water
to
white
hall
and
there
to
chapel
in
my
pew
belonging
to
me
as
clerke
of
the
privy
seale
and
there
i
heard
a
most
excellent
sermon
of
hacket
bishop
of
lichfield
and
coventry
john
hacket
elected
bishop
of
that
see
ob
upon
these
words
he
that
drinketh
this
water
shall
never
thirst
we
had
an
excellent
anthem
sung
by
captn
cooke
and
another
and
brave
musique
and
then
the
king
come
down
and
offered
and
took
the
sacrament
upon
his
knees
a
sight
very
well
worth
seeing
after
dinner
to
chapel
again
and
there
had
another
good
anthem
of
captn
cooke
thence
to
the
where
the
king
and
councell
sat
till
almost
eleven
at
night
and
i
forced
to
walk
up
and
down
the
gallerys
till
that
time
of
night
they
were
reading
all
the
bills
over
that
are
to
pass
at
the
house
before
the
king
going
out
of
towne
and
proroguing
the
house
at
last
the
councell
risen
sir
carteret
told
me
what
the
councell
hath
ordered
about
the
ships
designed
to
carry
horse
from
ireland
to
portugall
which
is
now
altered
i
hear
that
the
house
of
commons
do
think
much
that
they
should
be
forced
to
huddle
over
business
this
morning
against
afternoon
for
the
king
to
pass
their
acts
that
he
may
go
out
of
towne
but
he
i
hear
since
was
forced
to
stay
till
almost
nine
at
night
before
he
could
have
done
and
then
prorogued
them
and
so
to
gilford
and
lay
there
sir
pen
and
i
did
a
little
business
at
the
office
and
so
home
again
then
comes
dean
fuller
dean
of
patrick
and
i
am
most
pleased
with
his
company
and
goodness
my
wife
and
i
to
my
lord
lodging
where
she
and
i
staid
walking
in
white
hall
garden
and
in
the
saw
the
finest
smocks
and
linnen
petticoats
of
my
lady
castlemaine
laced
with
rich
lace
at
the
bottom
that
ever
i
saw
and
did
me
good
to
look
at
them
sarah
told
me
how
the
king
dined
at
my
lady
castlemaine
and
supped
every
day
and
night
the
last
week
and
that
the
night
that
the
bonfires
were
made
for
joy
of
the
queene
arrivall
the
king
was
there
but
there
was
no
fire
at
her
door
though
at
all
the
rest
of
the
doors
almost
in
the
street
which
was
much
observed
and
that
the
king
and
she
did
send
for
a
pair
of
scales
and
weighed
one
another
and
she
being
with
child
was
said
to
be
heaviest
but
she
is
now
a
most
disconsolate
creature
and
comes
not
out
of
doors
since
the
king
going
this
morning
comes
an
order
from
the
secretary
of
state
nicholas
for
me
to
let
one
lee
a
councellor
view
what
papers
i
have
relating
to
passages
of
the
late
times
wherein
sir
vane
hand
is
employed
in
order
to
the
drawing
up
his
charge
which
i
did
to
the
wardrobe
reading
of
the
king
and
late
speeches
at
the
proroguing
of
the
houses
of
parliament
and
while
i
was
reading
news
was
brought
me
that
my
lord
sandwich
is
come
and
gone
up
to
my
lady
chamber
which
by
and
by
he
did
and
looks
very
well
he
very
merry
and
hath
left
the
king
and
queene
at
portsmouth
and
is
come
up
to
stay
here
till
next
wednesday
and
then
to
meet
the
king
and
queene
at
hampton
court
so
to
dinner
and
my
lord
mighty
merry
among
other
things
saying
that
the
queene
is
a
very
agreeable
lady
and
paints
well
after
dinner
i
showed
him
my
letter
from
teddiman
about
the
news
from
argier
which
pleases
him
exceedingly
and
he
writ
one
to
the
duke
of
york
about
it
and
sent
it
express
abroad
with
creed
of
whom
i
informed
myself
of
all
i
had
a
mind
to
know
among
other
things
the
great
difficulty
my
lord
hath
been
in
all
this
summer
for
lack
of
good
and
full
orders
from
the
king
and
i
doubt
our
lords
of
the
councell
do
not
mind
things
as
the
late
powers
did
but
their
pleasure
or
profit
more
that
the
bull
feasts
are
a
simple
sport
yet
the
greatest
in
spaine
that
the
queene
hath
given
no
rewards
to
any
of
the
captains
or
officers
but
only
to
my
lord
sandwich
and
that
was
a
bag
of
gold
which
was
no
honorable
present
of
about
sterling
how
recluse
the
queene
hath
ever
been
and
all
the
voyage
never
come
upon
the
deck
nor
put
her
head
out
of
her
cabin
but
did
love
my
lord
musique
and
would
send
for
it
down
to
the
and
she
sit
in
her
cabin
within
hearing
of
it
but
my
lord
was
forced
to
have
some
clashing
with
the
council
of
portugall
about
payment
of
the
portion
before
he
could
get
it
which
was
besides
tangier
and
free
trade
in
the
indys
two
millions
of
crownes
half
now
and
the
other
half
in
twelve
months
but
they
have
brought
but
little
money
but
the
rest
in
sugars
and
other
commoditys
and
bills
of
exchange
that
the
king
of
portugall
is
a
very
foole
almost
and
his
mother
do
all
and
he
is
a
very
poor
prince
to
church
and
heard
a
good
sermon
of
woodcocke
at
our
church
only
in
his
latter
prayer
for
a
woman
in
childbed
he
prayed
that
god
would
deliver
her
from
the
hereditary
curse
of
which
seemed
a
pretty
strange
expression
out
with
captn
ferrers
to
charing
cross
and
there
at
the
triumph
taverne
he
showed
me
some
portugall
ladys
which
are
come
to
towne
before
the
queene
they
are
not
handsome
and
their
farthingales
a
strange
dress
many
ladies
and
persons
of
quality
come
to
see
them
i
find
nothing
in
them
that
is
pleasing
and
i
see
they
have
learnt
to
kiss
and
look
freely
up
and
down
already
and
i
do
believe
will
soon
forget
the
recluse
practice
of
their
own
country
they
complain
much
for
lack
of
good
water
to
drink
the
king
guards
and
some
city
companies
do
walk
up
and
downe
the
towne
these
five
or
six
days
which
makes
me
think
and
they
do
say
there
are
some
plots
in
laying
to
the
trinity
house
where
the
brethren
have
been
at
deptford
choosing
a
new
master
which
is
sir
minnes
notwithstanding
sir
batten
did
contend
highly
for
it
at
which
i
am
not
a
little
pleased
because
of
his
proud
lady
this
day
being
the
king
was
very
solemnly
observed
and
the
more
for
that
the
queene
this
day
comes
to
hampton
court
in
the
evening
bonfires
were
made
but
nothing
to
the
great
number
that
was
heretofore
at
the
burning
of
the
rump
the
queene
is
brought
a
few
days
since
to
hampton
court
and
all
people
say
of
her
to
be
a
very
fine
and
handsome
lady
and
very
discreet
and
that
the
king
is
pleased
enough
with
her
which
i
fear
will
put
madam
castlemaine
nose
out
of
joynt
the
court
is
wholly
now
at
hampton
a
peace
with
argier
is
lately
made
which
is
also
good
news
my
lord
sandwich
is
lately
come
with
the
queene
from
sea
very
well
and
in
good
repute
the
act
for
uniformity
is
lately
printed
which
it
is
thought
will
make
mad
work
among
the
presbyterian
ministers
people
of
all
sides
are
very
much
discontented
some
thinking
themselves
used
contrary
to
promise
too
hardly
and
the
other
that
they
are
not
rewarded
so
much
as
they
expected
by
the
king
june
at
the
office
and
coventry
brought
his
patent
and
took
his
place
with
us
this
morning
to
the
wardrobe
where
i
found
my
lady
come
from
hampton
court
where
the
queene
hath
used
her
very
civilly
and
my
lady
tells
me
is
a
most
pretty
woman
yesterday
sir
ford
told
me
the
aldermen
of
the
city
did
attend
her
in
their
habits
and
did
present
her
with
a
gold
cupp
and
in
gold
therein
but
he
told
me
that
they
are
so
poor
in
their
chamber
that
they
were
fain
to
call
two
or
three
aldermen
to
raise
fines
to
make
up
this
sum
povy
thomas
povy
for
bosiney
and
treasurer
for
tangier
evelyn
mentions
his
house
in
lincoln
and
he
appears
from
an
ancient
plan
of
whitehall
palace
to
have
had
apartments
there
and
sir
batten
and
i
by
water
to
woolwich
and
there
saw
an
experiment
made
of
sir
ford
yarne
about
which
we
have
lately
had
so
much
stir
and
i
have
much
concerned
myself
for
our
hughes
who
represented
it
so
bad
and
we
found
it
to
be
very
bad
and
broke
sooner
than
upon
a
fair
triall
five
threads
of
that
against
four
of
riga
yarne
and
also
that
some
of
it
had
old
stuffe
that
had
been
tarred
covered
over
with
new
hempe
which
is
such
a
cheat
as
hath
not
been
heard
of
to
the
office
i
find
coventry
is
resolved
to
do
much
good
and
to
enquire
into
all
the
miscarriages
of
the
office
at
noon
with
him
and
sir
batten
to
dinner
at
trinity
house
where
among
others
sir
robinson
lieutenant
of
the
tower
was
who
says
that
yesterday
sir
vane
had
a
full
hearing
at
the
king
bench
and
is
found
guilty
and
that
he
did
never
hear
any
man
argue
more
simply
than
he
in
all
his
life
and
so
others
say
sent
for
to
sir
carteret
i
perceive
as
he
told
me
were
it
not
that
coventry
had
already
feathered
his
nest
in
selling
of
places
he
do
like
him
very
well
and
hopes
great
good
from
him
but
he
complains
so
of
lack
of
money
that
my
heart
is
very
sad
under
the
apprehension
of
the
fall
of
the
office
all
the
morning
much
business
and
great
hopes
of
bringing
things
by
coventry
means
to
a
good
condition
in
the
office
i
tried
on
my
riding
cloth
suit
with
close
knees
the
first
that
ever
i
had
and
i
think
they
will
be
very
convenient
at
the
office
all
the
morning
among
other
businesses
i
did
get
a
vote
signed
by
all
concerning
my
issuing
of
warrants
which
they
did
not
smell
the
use
i
intend
to
make
of
it
but
it
is
to
plead
for
my
clerks
to
have
their
right
of
giving
out
all
the
warrants
a
great
difference
happened
between
sir
carteret
and
coventry
about
passing
the
victualler
account
and
whether
sir
george
is
to
pay
the
victualler
his
money
or
the
exchequer
sir
george
claiming
it
to
be
his
place
to
save
his
it
ended
in
anger
and
i
believe
will
come
to
be
a
question
before
the
king
and
council
up
by
in
the
morning
and
read
cicero
second
oration
against
cataline
which
pleased
me
exceedingly
and
more
i
discern
therein
than
ever
i
thought
was
to
be
found
in
him
but
i
perceive
it
was
my
ignorance
and
that
he
is
as
good
a
writer
as
ever
i
read
in
my
life
by
and
by
to
sir
carteret
to
talk
with
him
about
yesterday
difference
at
the
office
and
offered
my
service
to
look
into
my
old
books
or
papers
that
i
have
that
may
make
for
him
he
was
well
pleased
therewith
and
did
much
inveigh
against
coventry
telling
me
how
he
had
done
him
service
in
the
parliament
when
prin
had
drawn
up
things
against
him
for
taking
of
money
for
places
that
he
did
at
his
desire
and
upon
his
letters
keep
him
off
from
doing
it
and
many
other
things
he
told
me
as
how
the
king
was
beholden
to
him
and
in
what
a
miserable
condition
his
family
would
be
if
he
should
die
before
he
hath
cleared
his
accounts
upon
the
whole
i
do
find
that
he
do
much
esteem
of
me
and
is
my
friend
about
having
a
room
got
ready
for
us
we
all
went
out
to
the
and
there
over
against
the
scaffold
made
on
purpose
this
day
saw
sis
henry
vane
brought
a
very
great
press
of
people
he
made
a
long
speech
many
times
interrupted
by
the
sheriffe
and
others
there
and
they
would
have
taken
his
paper
out
of
his
hand
but
he
would
not
let
it
go
but
they
caused
all
the
books
of
those
that
writ
after
him
to
be
given
the
sheriffe
and
the
trumpets
were
brought
under
the
scaffold
that
he
might
not
be
heard
then
he
prayed
and
so
fitted
himself
and
received
the
blow
but
the
scaffold
was
so
crowded
that
we
could
not
see
it
done
but
boreman
who
had
been
upon
the
scaffold
told
us
that
first
he
began
to
speak
of
the
irregular
proceeding
against
him
that
he
was
against
magna
charta
denied
to
have
his
exceptions
against
the
indictment
allowed
and
that
there
he
was
stopped
by
the
sheriffe
then
he
drew
out
his
paper
of
notes
and
begun
to
tell
them
first
his
life
that
he
was
born
a
gentleman
he
had
been
till
he
was
seventeen
years
old
a
good
fellow
but
then
it
pleased
god
to
lay
a
foundation
of
grace
in
his
heart
by
which
he
was
persuaded
against
his
worldly
interest
to
leave
all
preferment
and
go
abroad
where
he
might
serve
god
with
more
freedom
then
he
was
called
home
and
made
a
member
of
the
long
parliament
where
he
never
did
to
this
day
any
thing
against
his
conscience
but
all
for
the
glory
of
god
here
he
would
have
given
them
an
account
of
the
proceedings
of
the
long
parliament
but
they
so
often
interrupted
him
that
at
last
he
was
forced
to
give
over
and
so
fell
into
prayer
for
england
in
generall
then
for
the
churches
in
england
and
then
for
the
city
of
london
and
so
fitted
himself
for
the
block
and
received
the
blow
he
had
a
blister
or
issue
upon
his
neck
which
he
desired
them
not
to
hurt
he
changed
not
his
colour
or
speech
to
the
last
but
died
justifying
himself
and
the
cause
he
had
stood
for
and
spoke
very
confidently
of
his
being
presently
at
the
right
hand
of
christ
and
in
all
things
appeared
the
most
resolved
man
that
ever
died
in
that
manner
and
showed
more
of
heate
than
cowardize
but
yet
with
all
humility
and
gravity
one
asked
him
why
he
did
not
pray
for
the
king
he
answered
you
shall
see
i
can
pray
for
the
king
i
pray
god
bless
him
the
king
had
given
his
body
to
his
friends
and
therefore
he
told
them
that
he
hoped
they
would
be
civil
to
his
body
when
dead
and
desired
they
would
let
him
die
like
a
gentleman
and
a
christian
and
not
crowded
and
pressed
as
he
was
so
to
the
office
a
little
and
to
the
and
there
all
of
us
to
dinner
and
to
the
office
again
all
the
afternoon
till
night
this
day
i
hear
my
lord
peterborough
is
come
unexpected
from
tangier
to
give
the
king
an
account
of
the
place
which
we
fear
is
in
none
of
the
best
condition
we
had
also
certain
news
that
the
spaniard
is
before
lisbone
with
thirteen
sayle
six
dutch
and
the
rest
his
own
ships
which
will
i
fear
be
ill
for
portugall
i
writ
a
letter
of
all
this
day
proceedings
to
my
lord
at
hinchingbroke
up
early
and
after
reading
a
little
in
cicero
to
my
office
to
my
lord
crewe
and
dined
with
him
where
i
hear
the
courage
of
sir
vane
at
his
death
is
talked
on
every
where
as
a
miracle
i
walked
to
lilly
the
painter
peter
lely
the
celebrated
painter
afterwards
knighted
ob
where
i
saw
among
other
rare
things
the
duchesse
of
york
her
whole
body
sitting
in
state
in
a
chair
in
white
sattin
and
another
of
the
king
that
is
not
finished
most
rare
things
i
did
give
the
fellow
something
that
showed
them
us
and
promised
to
come
some
other
time
and
he
would
show
me
lady
castlemaine
which
i
could
not
then
see
it
being
locked
up
thence
to
wright
the
painter
michael
wright
a
native
of
scotland
and
painter
of
some
note
settled
in
london
but
lord
the
difference
that
is
between
their
two
works
drew
up
the
agreement
between
the
king
and
sir
john
winter
secretary
and
chancellor
to
the
queen
dowager
about
the
forrest
of
deane
and
having
done
it
he
come
himself
i
did
not
know
him
to
be
the
queene
secretary
before
but
observed
him
to
be
a
man
of
fine
parts
and
we
read
it
and
both
liked
it
well
that
done
i
turned
to
the
forrest
of
deane
in
speede
mapps
and
there
he
showed
me
how
it
lies
and
the
with
the
great
charge
of
carrying
it
to
lydny
and
many
other
things
worth
my
knowing
and
i
do
perceive
that
i
am
very
short
in
my
business
by
not
knowing
many
times
the
geographical
part
of
my
business
i
went
to
the
exchange
and
i
hear
that
the
merchants
have
a
great
fear
of
a
breach
with
the
spaniard
for
they
think
he
will
not
brook
our
having
tangier
dunkirke
and
jamaica
and
our
merchants
begin
to
draw
home
their
estates
as
fast
as
they
can
at
noon
sir
pen
and
i
to
the
trinity
house
where
was
a
feast
made
by
the
wardens
great
good
cheer
and
much
but
ordinary
company
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
upon
my
demanding
how
sir
vane
died
told
me
that
he
died
in
a
passion
but
all
confess
with
so
much
courage
as
never
man
did
this
day
i
am
told
of
a
portugall
lady
at
hampton
court
that
hath
dropped
a
child
already
since
the
queene
coming
and
the
king
would
not
have
them
searched
whose
it
is
and
so
it
is
not
commonly
known
yet
coming
home
i
met
with
will
swan
who
do
talk
as
high
for
the
fanatiques
as
ever
he
did
in
his
life
and
do
pity
my
lord
sandwich
and
me
that
we
should
be
given
up
to
the
wickedness
of
the
world
and
that
a
fall
is
coming
upon
us
all
for
he
finds
that
he
and
his
company
are
the
true
spirit
of
the
nation
and
the
greater
part
of
the
nation
too
who
will
have
liberty
of
conscience
in
spite
of
this
act
of
uniformity
or
they
will
die
and
if
they
may
not
preach
abroad
they
will
preach
in
their
own
houses
he
told
me
that
certainly
sir
vane
must
be
gone
to
heaven
for
he
died
as
much
a
martyr
and
saint
as
ever
man
did
and
that
the
king
hath
lost
more
by
that
man
death
than
he
will
get
again
a
good
while
at
all
which
i
know
not
what
to
think
but
i
confess
i
do
think
that
the
bishops
will
never
be
able
to
carry
it
so
high
as
they
do
meeting
with
frank
moore
my
lord
lambeth
man
formerly
we
and
two
or
three
friends
of
his
did
go
to
a
taverne
but
one
of
our
company
a
talking
fellow
did
in
discourse
say
much
of
this
act
against
seamen
for
their
being
brought
to
account
and
that
it
was
made
on
purpose
for
my
lord
sandwich
who
was
in
debt
and
hath
been
forced
to
have
pardon
oftentimes
from
oliver
for
the
same
at
which
i
was
vexed
at
night
news
is
brought
me
that
field
the
rogue
hath
this
day
cast
me
at
guildhall
in
for
his
imprisonment
to
which
i
signed
his
commitment
with
the
rest
of
the
officers
but
they
having
been
he
do
begin
the
law
with
me
but
threatens
more
nicholson
thomas
nicholson
my
old
at
magdalene
come
and
we
played
three
or
four
things
upon
the
violin
and
basse
to
my
lord
who
rose
as
soon
as
be
heard
i
was
there
and
in
his
and
shirt
stood
talking
with
me
alone
two
hours
i
believe
concerning
his
greatest
matters
of
state
and
interest
among
other
things
that
his
greatest
design
is
first
to
get
clear
of
all
debts
to
the
king
for
the
embassy
money
and
then
a
pardon
then
to
get
his
land
settled
and
then
to
discourse
and
advise
what
is
best
for
him
whether
to
keep
his
sea
employment
longer
or
no
for
he
do
discern
that
the
duke
would
be
willing
to
have
him
out
and
that
by
means
and
here
he
told
me
how
the
terms
at
argier
were
wholly
his
and
that
be
did
plainly
tell
lawson
and
agree
with
him
that
he
would
have
the
honour
of
them
if
they
should
ever
be
agreed
to
and
that
accordingly
they
did
come
over
hither
entitled
articles
concluded
on
by
sir
lawson
according
to
instructions
received
from
his
royal
highness
james
duke
of
york
and
from
his
excellency
the
earle
of
sandwich
which
however
was
more
than
needed
but
lawson
tells
my
lord
in
his
letter
that
it
was
not
he
but
the
council
of
warr
that
would
have
his
royal
highness
put
into
the
title
though
he
did
not
contribute
one
word
to
it
but
the
duke
of
york
did
yesterday
propose
them
to
the
council
to
be
printed
with
this
title
concluded
on
by
sir
lawson
knt
and
my
lord
quite
left
out
here
i
find
my
lord
very
politique
for
he
tells
me
that
he
discerns
they
design
to
set
up
lawson
as
much
as
they
can
and
that
he
do
counterplot
them
by
setting
him
up
higher
still
by
which
they
will
find
themselves
spoiled
of
their
design
and
at
last
grow
jealous
of
lawson
this
he
told
me
with
much
pleasure
and
that
several
of
the
duke
servants
by
name
my
lord
barkeley
talbot
and
others
had
complained
to
my
lord
of
coventry
and
would
have
him
out
my
lord
do
acknowledge
that
his
greatest
obstacle
is
coventry
he
did
seem
to
hint
such
a
question
as
this
hitherto
i
have
been
supported
by
the
king
and
chancellor
against
the
duke
but
what
if
it
should
come
about
that
it
should
be
the
duke
and
chancellor
against
the
king
which
though
he
said
it
in
several
plain
words
yet
i
could
not
fully
understand
it
but
may
more
hereafter
my
lord
did
also
tell
me
that
the
duke
himself
at
portsmouth
did
thank
my
lord
for
all
his
pains
and
care
and
that
he
perceived
it
must
be
the
old
captains
that
must
do
the
business
and
that
the
new
ones
would
spoil
all
and
that
my
lord
did
very
discreetly
tell
the
duke
though
quite
against
his
judgement
and
inclination
that
however
the
king
new
captaines
ought
to
be
borne
with
a
little
and
encouraged
by
which
he
will
oblige
that
party
and
prevent
as
much
as
may
be
their
entry
but
he
says
certainly
things
will
go
to
rack
if
ever
the
old
captains
should
be
wholly
out
and
the
new
ones
only
command
i
met
sir
pen
he
told
me
the
day
now
was
fixed
for
his
going
into
ireland
and
that
whereas
i
had
mentioned
some
service
he
could
do
a
friend
of
mine
there
saml
pepys
mentioned
elsewhere
as
my
cousin
in
ireland
he
told
me
he
would
most
readily
do
what
i
would
command
him
great
talk
there
is
of
a
fear
of
a
war
with
the
dutch
and
we
have
order
to
pitch
upon
twenty
ships
to
be
forthwith
set
out
but
i
hope
it
is
but
a
to
the
world
to
let
them
see
that
we
can
be
ready
for
them
though
god
knows
the
king
is
not
able
to
set
out
five
ships
at
this
present
without
great
difficulty
we
neither
having
money
credit
nor
stores
told
my
lady
carteret
how
my
lady
fanshaw
anne
daughter
of
sir
john
harrison
wife
of
sir
richard
fanshawe
she
wrote
memoirs
of
her
life
vide
sewards
anecdotes
is
fallen
out
with
her
only
for
speaking
in
behalf
of
the
french
which
my
lady
wonders
at
they
having
been
formerly
like
sisters
thence
to
my
house
where
i
took
great
pride
to
lead
her
through
the
court
by
the
hand
she
being
very
fine
and
her
page
carrying
up
her
train
observations
this
i
take
to
be
as
bad
a
juncture
as
ever
i
observed
the
king
and
his
new
queene
minding
their
pleasures
at
hampton
court
all
people
discontented
some
that
the
king
do
not
gratify
them
enough
and
the
others
fanatiques
of
all
sorts
that
the
king
do
take
away
their
liberty
of
conscience
and
the
height
of
the
bishops
who
i
fear
will
ruin
all
again
they
do
much
cry
up
the
manner
of
sir
vane
death
and
he
deserves
it
much
clamour
against
the
and
the
people
say
they
will
not
pay
it
without
force
and
in
the
meantime
like
to
have
war
abroad
and
portugall
to
assist
when
we
have
not
money
to
pay
for
any
ordinary
at
home
july
up
while
the
chimes
went
four
and
so
put
down
my
journal
so
to
my
office
to
read
over
such
instructions
as
concern
the
officers
of
the
yard
for
i
am
much
upon
seeing
into
the
miscarriages
there
by
and
by
by
appointment
comes
commissioner
pett
and
then
a
messenger
from
coventry
who
sits
in
his
boat
expecting
us
so
we
down
to
him
at
the
tower
and
there
took
water
all
and
to
deptford
he
in
our
passage
taking
notice
how
much
difference
there
is
between
the
old
captains
for
obedience
and
order
and
the
king
new
captains
which
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
him
confess
and
there
we
went
into
the
and
viewed
first
the
provisions
there
and
then
his
books
but
davis
himself
was
not
there
and
i
do
not
perceive
that
there
is
of
their
duties
performed
but
i
perceive
to
my
great
content
coventry
will
have
things
performed
in
the
evening
come
lewis
to
me
and
very
ingeniously
did
enquire
whether
i
ever
did
look
into
the
business
of
the
chest
at
chatham
and
after
my
readiness
to
be
informed
did
appear
to
him
he
did
produce
a
paper
wherein
he
stated
the
government
of
the
chest
to
me
and
upon
the
whole
did
tell
me
how
it
hath
ever
been
abused
and
to
this
day
is
and
what
a
meritorious
act
it
would
be
to
look
after
it
which
i
am
resolved
to
do
if
god
bless
me
and
do
thank
him
very
much
for
it
dined
with
the
officers
of
the
ordnance
where
sir
compton
and
other
great
persons
were
after
dinner
was
brought
to
sir
compton
a
gun
to
discharge
seven
times
the
best
of
all
devices
that
ever
i
saw
and
very
serviceable
and
not
a
bawble
for
it
is
much
approved
of
and
many
thereof
made
to
supper
with
my
lady
sandwich
who
tells
me
with
much
trouble
that
my
lady
castlemaine
is
still
as
great
with
the
king
and
that
the
king
comes
as
often
to
her
as
ever
he
did
jack
cole
my
old
friend
found
me
out
at
the
wardrobe
and
among
other
things
he
told
me
that
certainly
most
of
the
chief
ministers
of
london
would
fling
up
their
livings
and
that
soon
or
late
the
issue
thereof
would
be
sad
to
the
king
and
court
to
the
wardrobe
where
all
alone
with
my
lord
above
an
hour
and
he
do
seem
still
to
have
his
old
confidence
in
me
and
tells
me
to
boot
that
coventry
hath
spoke
of
me
to
him
to
great
advantage
wherein
i
am
much
pleased
by
and
by
comes
in
coventry
to
visit
my
lord
and
so
my
lord
and
he
and
i
walked
together
in
the
great
chamber
a
good
while
and
i
found
him
a
most
ingenuous
man
and
good
company
this
day
i
was
told
that
my
lady
castlemaine
being
quite
fallen
out
with
her
husband
did
yesterday
go
away
from
him
with
all
her
plate
jewels
and
other
best
things
and
is
gone
to
richmond
to
a
brother
of
hers
which
i
am
apt
to
think
was
a
design
to
get
out
of
town
that
the
king
might
come
at
her
the
better
to
my
office
and
by
and
by
to
our
sitting
where
much
business
coventry
took
his
leave
being
to
go
with
the
duke
over
for
the
in
the
afternoon
i
went
upon
the
river
it
raining
hard
upon
the
water
i
put
ashore
and
sheltered
myself
while
the
king
come
by
in
his
barge
going
down
towards
the
downes
to
meet
the
queene
the
duke
being
gone
yesterday
but
methought
it
lessened
my
esteem
of
a
king
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
command
the
rain
to
woolwich
to
the
and
there
looked
over
several
sorts
of
hemp
and
did
fall
upon
my
great
survey
of
seeing
the
working
and
experiments
of
the
strength
and
the
charge
in
the
dressing
of
every
sort
and
i
do
think
have
brought
it
to
so
great
a
certainty
as
i
have
done
the
king
some
service
in
it
and
do
purpose
to
get
it
ready
against
the
duke
coming
to
towne
to
present
to
him
i
see
it
is
impossible
for
the
king
to
have
things
done
as
cheap
as
other
men
i
had
letters
from
the
downes
from
coventry
who
tells
me
of
the
foul
weather
they
had
last
sunday
that
drove
them
back
from
near
bologne
whither
they
were
going
for
the
queene
back
again
to
the
downes
with
the
loss
of
their
cables
sayles
and
masts
but
are
all
safe
only
my
lord
sandwich
who
went
before
with
the
yacht
they
know
not
what
is
become
of
him
which
do
trouble
me
much
but
i
hope
he
got
ashore
before
the
storm
begun
which
god
grant
much
disturbed
by
reason
of
the
talk
up
and
downe
the
towne
that
my
lord
sandwich
is
lost
but
i
trust
in
god
the
contrary
i
hear
to
my
great
content
that
my
lord
sandwich
is
safe
landed
in
france
i
had
a
letter
from
creed
who
hath
escaped
narrowly
in
the
king
yacht
and
got
safe
to
the
downes
after
the
late
storm
and
he
says
that
there
the
king
do
tell
him
that
he
is
sure
my
lord
is
landed
in
callis
safe
this
afternoon
i
went
to
westminster
and
there
hear
that
the
king
and
queene
intend
to
come
to
white
hall
from
hampton
court
next
week
for
all
winter
thence
to
sarah
lord
sandwich
housekeeper
and
there
looked
over
my
lord
lodgings
which
are
very
pretty
and
white
hall
garden
and
the
where
lords
and
ladies
are
now
at
bowles
in
brave
condition
sarah
told
me
how
the
falling
out
between
my
lady
castlemaine
and
her
lord
was
about
christening
of
the
child
lately
which
he
would
have
and
had
done
by
a
priest
and
some
days
after
she
had
it
again
christened
by
a
minister
the
king
and
lord
of
oxford
aubrey
de
vere
twentieth
and
last
earl
of
oxford
ob
and
duchesse
of
suffolk
perhaps
a
mistake
for
countess
as
there
was
no
duchess
of
suffolk
at
that
period
being
witnesses
and
christened
with
a
proviso
that
it
had
not
already
been
christened
since
that
she
left
her
lord
carrying
away
every
thing
in
the
house
so
much
as
every
dish
and
cloth
and
servant
but
the
porter
he
is
gone
discontented
into
france
they
say
to
enter
a
monastery
and
now
she
is
coming
back
again
to
her
house
in
but
i
hear
that
the
queene
did
prick
her
out
of
the
list
presented
her
by
the
king
desiring
that
she
might
have
that
favour
done
her
or
that
he
would
send
her
from
whence
she
come
and
that
the
king
was
angry
and
the
queene
discontented
a
whole
day
and
night
upon
it
but
that
the
king
hath
promised
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
hereafter
but
i
can
not
believe
that
the
king
can
fling
her
off
so
he
loving
her
too
well
and
so
i
writ
this
night
to
my
lady
to
be
my
opinion
she
calling
her
my
lady
and
the
lady
i
admire
here
i
find
that
my
lord
hath
lost
the
garden
to
his
lodgings
and
that
it
is
turning
into
a
i
to
walk
in
the
parke
which
is
now
every
day
more
and
more
pleasant
by
the
new
works
upon
it
walked
to
the
and
there
took
boat
for
the
tower
hearing
that
the
is
come
this
morning
already
as
high
as
woolwich
and
that
my
lord
sandwich
was
with
her
at
which
my
heart
was
glad
by
water
to
white
hall
and
there
waited
upon
my
lord
sandwich
and
joyed
him
at
his
lodgings
of
his
safe
coming
home
after
all
his
danger
which
he
confesses
to
be
very
great
and
his
people
do
tell
me
how
bravely
my
lord
did
carry
himself
while
my
lord
crofts
william
crofts
created
baron
crofts
of
saxham
in
suffolk
and
died
did
cry
and
i
perceive
all
the
town
talk
how
poorly
he
carried
himself
but
the
best
was
one
of
rawlins
a
courtier
that
was
with
my
lord
and
in
the
greatest
danger
cried
my
lord
i
wo
give
you
for
your
place
now
but
all
ends
in
the
honour
of
the
which
had
they
not
been
very
good
boats
they
could
never
have
endured
the
sea
as
they
did
at
noon
coventry
and
i
by
his
coach
to
the
exchange
together
and
in
met
captn
browne
of
the
rosebush
at
which
he
was
cruel
angry
and
did
threaten
to
go
to
the
duke
at
hampton
court
and
get
him
turned
out
because
he
was
not
sailed
august
this
day
commissioner
pett
told
me
how
despicable
a
thing
it
is
to
be
a
hangman
in
poland
although
it
be
a
place
of
credit
and
that
in
his
time
there
was
some
repairs
to
be
made
of
the
gallows
there
which
was
very
fine
of
stone
but
nobody
could
be
got
to
mend
it
till
the
or
mayor
of
the
towne
with
all
the
companies
of
those
trades
which
were
necessary
to
be
used
about
those
repairs
did
go
in
their
habits
with
flags
in
solemn
procession
to
the
place
and
there
the
did
give
the
first
blow
with
the
hammer
upon
the
wooden
work
and
the
rest
of
the
masters
of
the
companys
upon
the
works
belonging
to
their
trades
that
so
workmen
might
not
be
ashamed
to
be
employed
upon
doing
of
the
gallows
works
by
water
to
white
hall
and
so
to
james
but
there
found
coventry
gone
to
hampton
court
so
to
my
lord
and
he
is
also
gone
this
being
a
great
day
at
the
council
about
some
business
before
the
king
here
pierce
the
chyrurgeon
told
me
how
edward
montagu
hath
lately
had
a
duell
with
cholmely
that
is
first
to
the
queene
and
was
a
messenger
to
her
from
the
king
of
portugall
and
is
a
fine
gentleman
but
had
received
many
affronts
from
montagu
and
some
unkindness
from
my
lord
upon
his
score
for
which
i
am
sorry
he
proved
too
hard
for
montagu
and
drove
him
so
far
backward
that
he
fell
into
a
ditch
and
dropt
his
sword
but
with
honour
would
take
no
advantage
over
him
but
did
give
him
his
life
and
the
world
says
montagu
did
carry
himself
very
poorly
in
the
business
and
hath
lost
his
honour
for
ever
with
all
people
in
it
this
afternoon
waith
was
with
me
and
did
tell
me
much
concerning
the
chest
which
i
am
resolved
to
look
into
and
i
perceive
he
is
sensible
of
sir
batten
carriage
and
is
pleased
to
see
any
thing
work
against
him
dined
with
falconer
thence
we
walked
talking
all
the
way
to
greenwich
and
i
do
find
excellent
discourse
from
him
among
other
things
his
rule
of
suspecting
every
man
that
proposes
any
thing
to
him
to
be
a
knave
or
at
least
to
have
some
ends
of
his
own
in
it
being
led
thereto
by
the
story
of
sir
john
millicent
that
would
have
had
a
patent
from
king
james
for
every
man
to
have
had
leave
to
have
gives
him
a
shilling
and
that
he
might
take
it
of
every
man
that
had
a
mind
to
give
it
and
what
he
would
do
to
them
that
would
not
give
him
he
answered
he
would
not
force
them
but
that
they
should
come
to
the
council
of
state
to
give
a
reason
why
they
would
not
another
rule
is
a
proverb
that
he
hath
been
taught
which
is
that
a
man
that
can
not
sit
still
in
his
chamber
the
reason
of
which
i
did
not
understand
and
he
that
can
not
say
no
that
is
that
is
of
so
good
a
nature
that
he
can
not
deny
any
thing
or
cross
another
in
doing
any
thing
is
not
fit
for
business
the
last
of
which
is
a
very
great
fault
of
mine
which
i
must
amend
in
coventry
and
i
alone
eat
at
the
office
all
the
morning
upon
business
and
so
to
dinner
to
trinity
house
and
thence
by
his
coach
towards
white
hall
but
there
being
a
stop
at
the
savoy
we
light
and
took
water
and
my
lord
sandwich
being
out
of
towne
we
parted
there
i
walked
to
dunstan
the
church
being
now
finished
and
here
i
heard
bates
bates
a
celebrated
nonconformist
divine
who
made
a
most
eloquent
sermon
and
i
am
sorry
i
have
hitherto
had
so
low
an
opinion
of
the
man
for
i
have
not
heard
a
neater
sermon
a
great
while
and
more
to
my
content
my
uncle
fenner
told
me
the
new
which
is
now
lately
come
forth
was
laid
upon
their
deske
at
sepulchre
for
george
to
read
but
he
laid
it
aside
and
would
not
meddle
with
it
and
i
perceive
the
presbyters
do
all
prepare
to
give
over
all
against
bartholomewtide
mr
herring
being
lately
turned
out
at
bride
did
read
the
psalme
to
the
people
while
they
sung
at
bates
which
methought
is
a
strange
turn
after
dinner
to
st
bride
and
there
heard
one
carpenter
an
old
man
who
they
say
hath
been
a
jesuite
priest
and
is
come
over
to
us
but
he
preached
very
well
calamy
hath
taken
his
farewell
this
day
of
his
people
and
others
will
do
so
the
next
sunday
turner
sir
william
turner
lord
mayor
of
london
the
draper
i
hear
is
knighted
made
alderman
and
pricked
for
sheriffe
with
sir
thomas
bluddel
a
mistake
for
bludworth
for
the
next
year
by
the
king
and
so
are
called
with
great
honour
the
king
sheriffes
up
early
and
to
my
office
by
and
by
we
met
on
purpose
to
enquire
into
the
business
of
where
i
am
the
person
that
do
chiefly
manage
the
business
against
them
on
the
king
part
and
i
do
find
it
the
greatest
cheat
that
i
have
yet
found
they
having
eightpence
per
yard
allowed
them
by
pretence
of
a
contract
where
no
such
thing
appears
and
it
is
threepence
more
than
was
formerly
paid
and
than
i
now
offer
the
board
to
have
them
done
to
lambeth
and
there
saw
the
little
boat
in
building
by
the
king
my
lord
brunkard
william
second
lord
brouncker
viscount
of
castle
lyons
created
in
at
oxford
keeper
of
the
great
seal
to
the
queen
a
commissioner
of
the
admiralty
and
master
of
catherine
hospital
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
talents
and
some
years
president
of
the
royal
society
ob
aged
and
the
virtuosoes
of
the
towne
according
to
new
lines
which
pett
cries
up
mightily
but
how
it
will
prove
we
shall
soon
see
commissioner
pett
and
i
being
invited
went
by
sir
john
winter
coach
sent
for
us
to
the
miter
in
to
a
where
i
found
him
a
very
worthy
man
and
good
discourse
most
of
which
was
concerning
the
forest
of
deane
and
the
timber
there
and
with
their
great
antiquity
and
the
vast
heaps
of
cinders
which
they
find
and
are
now
of
great
value
being
necessary
for
the
making
of
iron
at
this
day
and
without
which
they
can
not
work
with
the
age
of
many
trees
there
left
at
a
great
fall
in
edward
the
third
time
by
the
name
of
which
at
this
day
are
called
vorbid
trees
i
went
to
paul
church
yard
to
my
bookseller
and
there
i
hear
that
next
sunday
will
be
the
last
of
a
great
many
presbyterian
ministers
in
towne
who
i
hear
will
give
up
all
i
pray
god
the
issue
may
be
good
for
the
discontent
is
great
my
mind
well
pleased
with
a
letter
that
i
found
at
home
from
coventry
expressing
his
satisfaction
in
a
letter
i
writ
last
night
and
sent
him
this
morning
to
be
corrected
by
him
in
order
to
its
sending
down
to
all
the
yards
as
a
charge
to
them
this
being
the
last
sunday
that
the
presbyterians
are
to
preach
unless
they
read
the
new
common
prayer
and
renounce
the
covenant
i
had
a
mind
to
hear
bates
farewell
sermon
and
walked
to
st
dunstan
where
it
not
being
seven
yet
the
doors
were
not
open
and
so
i
walked
an
hour
in
the
garden
at
eight
i
went
and
crowded
in
at
a
back
door
among
others
the
church
being
almost
before
any
doors
were
open
publicly
and
so
got
into
the
gallery
beside
the
pulpit
and
heard
very
well
his
text
was
now
the
god
of
peace
the
last
hebrews
and
the
verse
he
making
a
very
good
sermon
and
very
little
reflections
in
it
to
any
thing
of
the
times
to
madam
turner
and
dined
with
her
she
had
heard
parson
herring
take
his
leave
tho
he
by
reading
so
much
of
the
common
prayer
as
he
did
hath
cast
himself
out
of
the
good
opinion
of
both
sides
after
dinner
to
dunstan
again
and
the
church
quite
crowded
before
i
come
which
was
just
at
one
but
i
got
into
the
gallery
again
but
stood
in
a
crowd
he
dr
bates
pursued
his
text
again
very
well
and
only
at
the
conclusion
told
us
after
this
manner
i
do
believe
that
many
of
you
do
expect
that
i
should
say
something
to
you
in
reference
to
the
time
this
being
the
last
time
that
possibly
i
may
appear
here
you
know
not
it
is
not
my
manner
to
speak
anything
in
the
pulpit
that
is
extraneous
to
my
text
and
business
yet
this
i
shall
say
that
it
is
not
my
opinion
fashion
or
humour
that
keeps
me
from
complying
with
what
is
required
of
us
but
something
after
much
prayer
discourse
and
study
yet
remains
unsatisfied
and
commands
me
herein
wherefore
if
it
is
my
unhappinesse
not
to
receive
such
an
illuminacion
as
should
direct
me
to
do
otherwise
i
know
no
reason
why
men
should
not
pardon
me
in
this
world
as
i
am
confident
god
will
pardon
me
for
it
in
the
next
and
so
he
concluded
parson
herring
read
a
psalme
and
chapters
before
sermon
and
one
was
the
chapter
in
the
acts
where
the
story
of
ananias
and
sapphira
is
and
after
he
had
done
says
he
this
is
just
the
case
of
england
at
present
god
he
bids
us
to
preach
and
men
bid
us
not
to
preach
and
if
we
do
we
are
to
be
imprisoned
and
further
punished
all
that
i
can
say
to
it
is
that
i
beg
your
prayers
and
the
prayers
of
all
good
christians
for
us
this
was
all
the
exposition
be
made
of
the
chapter
in
these
very
words
and
no
more
i
was
much
pleased
with
manner
of
bringing
in
the
lord
prayer
after
his
owne
thus
in
whose
comprehensive
words
we
sum
up
all
our
imperfect
desires
saying
father
i
hear
most
of
the
presbyters
took
their
leaves
and
that
the
city
is
much
dissatisfied
with
it
i
pray
god
keep
peace
among
men
in
their
rooms
or
else
all
will
fly
for
bad
ones
will
not
go
down
with
the
city
deane
anthony
deane
afterwards
knighted
and
for
harwich
a
commissioner
of
the
navy
of
woolwich
and
i
rid
into
waltham
forest
and
there
we
saw
many
trees
of
the
king
and
he
showed
me
the
whole
mystery
of
off
square
wherein
the
king
is
abused
in
the
timber
that
he
buys
which
i
shall
with
much
pleasure
be
able
to
correct
we
rode
to
illford
and
there
while
dinner
was
getting
ready
he
and
i
practised
measuring
of
the
tables
and
other
things
till
i
did
understand
measure
of
timber
and
board
very
well
at
the
office
and
coventry
did
tell
us
of
the
duell
between
jermyn
he
became
baron
jermyn
on
the
death
of
his
uncle
the
earl
of
alban
and
died
unmarried
nephew
to
my
lord
alban
and
colonel
giles
rawlins
the
latter
of
whom
is
killed
and
the
first
mortally
wounded
as
it
is
thought
they
fought
against
captain
thomas
howard
according
to
collins
lord
carlisle
brother
name
was
charles
my
lord
carlisle
brother
and
another
unknown
who
they
say
had
armor
on
that
they
could
not
be
hurt
so
that
one
of
their
swords
went
up
to
the
hilt
against
it
they
had
horses
ready
and
are
fled
but
what
is
most
strange
howard
sent
one
challenge
before
but
they
could
not
meet
till
yesterday
at
the
old
pall
mall
at
james
and
he
would
not
to
the
last
tell
jermyn
what
the
quarrel
was
nor
do
any
body
know
the
court
is
much
concerned
in
this
fray
and
i
am
glad
of
it
hoping
that
it
will
cause
some
good
laws
against
it
after
sitting
sir
carteret
did
tell
me
how
he
had
spoke
of
me
to
my
lord
chancellor
and
that
if
my
lord
sandwich
would
ask
my
lord
chancellor
he
should
know
what
he
had
said
of
me
to
him
to
my
advantage
to
my
lord
sandwich
whom
i
found
in
bed
among
other
talk
he
do
tell
me
that
he
hath
put
me
into
commission
with
a
great
many
great
persons
in
the
business
of
tangier
which
is
a
very
great
honour
to
me
and
may
be
of
good
concernment
to
me
by
and
by
comes
in
coventry
to
us
whom
my
lord
tells
that
he
is
also
put
into
the
commission
and
that
i
am
there
of
which
he
said
he
was
glad
and
did
tell
my
lord
that
i
was
indeed
the
life
of
this
office
and
much
more
to
my
commendation
beyond
measure
and
that
whereas
before
he
did
bear
me
respect
for
his
sake
so
he
do
it
now
much
more
for
my
own
which
is
a
great
blessing
to
me
sir
carteret
having
told
me
what
he
did
yesterday
concerning
his
speaking
to
my
lord
chancellor
about
me
so
that
on
all
hands
by
god
blessing
i
find
myself
a
very
rising
man
by
and
by
comes
my
lord
peterborough
in
with
whom
we
talked
a
good
while
and
he
is
going
toward
tangier
again
i
perceive
there
is
yet
good
hopes
of
peace
with
guyland
a
moorish
usurper
who
had
put
himself
at
the
head
of
an
army
for
the
purpose
of
attacking
tangier
which
is
of
great
concernment
to
tangier
coventry
and
i
did
walk
together
a
great
while
in
the
garden
where
he
did
tell
me
his
mind
about
sir
having
so
much
the
command
of
the
money
which
must
be
removed
and
indeed
it
is
the
bane
of
all
our
business
he
observed
to
me
also
how
sir
batten
begins
to
struggle
and
to
look
after
his
business
i
also
put
him
upon
getting
an
order
from
the
duke
for
our
inquiries
into
the
chest
which
he
will
see
done
creed
and
i
walked
down
to
the
tylt
yard
and
so
all
along
but
could
not
get
a
boat
i
offered
eight
shillings
for
a
boat
to
attend
me
this
afternoon
and
they
would
not
it
being
the
day
of
the
queene
coming
to
town
from
hampton
court
so
we
fairly
walked
in
to
white
hall
and
through
my
lord
lodgings
we
got
into
white
hall
garden
and
so
to
the
and
up
to
the
top
of
the
new
banqueting
house
there
over
the
thames
which
was
a
most
pleasant
place
as
any
i
could
have
got
and
all
the
show
consisted
chiefly
in
the
number
of
boats
and
barges
and
two
pageants
one
of
a
king
and
another
of
a
queene
with
her
maydes
of
honour
sitting
at
her
feet
very
prettily
and
they
tell
me
the
queene
is
sir
richard
daughter
anon
come
the
king
and
queene
in
a
barge
under
a
canopy
with
barges
and
boats
i
know
for
we
could
see
no
water
for
them
nor
discern
the
king
nor
queene
and
so
they
landed
at
white
hall
bridge
and
the
great
guns
on
the
other
side
went
off
but
that
which
pleased
me
best
was
that
my
lady
castlemaine
stood
over
against
us
upon
a
piece
of
white
hall
but
methought
it
was
strange
to
see
her
lord
and
her
upon
the
same
place
walking
up
and
down
without
taking
notice
one
of
another
only
at
first
entry
he
put
off
his
hat
and
she
made
him
a
very
civil
salute
but
afterwards
took
no
notice
one
of
another
but
both
of
them
now
and
then
would
take
their
child
which
the
nurse
held
in
her
armes
and
dandle
it
one
thing
more
there
happened
a
scaffold
below
to
fall
and
we
feared
some
hurt
but
there
was
none
but
she
of
all
the
great
ladies
only
run
down
among
the
common
rabble
to
see
what
hurt
was
done
and
did
take
care
of
a
child
that
received
some
little
hurt
which
methought
was
so
noble
anon
there
come
one
there
booted
and
spurred
that
she
talked
along
with
and
by
and
by
she
being
in
her
haire
she
put
on
his
hat
which
was
but
an
ordinary
one
to
keep
the
wind
off
but
it
become
her
mightily
as
every
thing
else
do
walked
to
my
uncle
wight
here
i
staid
supper
and
much
company
there
was
among
others
burnett
cole
the
lawyer
rawlinson
and
sutton
among
other
things
they
tell
me
that
there
hath
been
a
disturbance
in
a
church
in
street
a
great
many
young
people
knotting
together
and
crying
out
porridge
often
and
seditiously
in
the
church
and
they
took
the
common
prayer
book
they
say
away
and
some
say
did
tear
it
but
it
is
a
thing
which
appears
to
me
very
ominous
i
pray
god
avert
it
to
rawlinson
and
there
supped
with
him
our
discourse
of
the
discontents
that
are
abroad
among
and
by
reason
of
the
presbyters
some
were
clapped
up
and
strict
watch
is
kept
in
the
city
by
the
and
abettors
of
a
plot
are
taken
god
preserve
us
for
all
these
things
bode
very
september
with
sir
batten
and
sir
pen
by
coach
to
james
this
being
the
first
day
of
our
meeting
there
by
the
duke
order
but
when
we
come
we
found
him
going
out
by
coach
with
his
duchesse
and
he
told
us
he
was
to
go
abroad
with
the
queene
to
durdan
it
seems
to
dine
with
my
lord
barkeley
lord
berkeley
seat
near
epsom
where
i
have
been
very
merry
when
i
was
a
little
boy
so
we
went
and
staid
a
little
at
coventry
chamber
and
i
to
my
lord
sandwich
who
is
gone
to
wait
upon
the
king
and
queene
coventry
told
us
how
the
fanatiques
and
presbyters
that
did
intend
to
rise
about
this
time
did
choose
this
day
as
the
most
auspicious
to
them
in
their
endeavours
against
monarchy
it
being
fatal
twice
to
the
king
and
the
day
of
oliver
death
but
blessed
be
god
all
is
likely
to
be
quiet
i
hope
fairbrother
tells
me
what
i
heard
confirmed
since
that
it
was
fully
resolved
by
the
king
new
council
that
an
indulgence
should
be
granted
the
presbyters
but
upon
the
bishop
of
gilbert
sheldon
speech
who
is
now
one
of
the
most
powerful
men
in
england
with
the
king
their
minds
were
wholly
turned
and
it
is
said
that
my
lord
albemarle
did
oppose
him
most
but
that
i
do
believe
is
only
an
appearance
he
told
me
also
that
most
of
the
presbyters
now
begin
to
wish
they
had
complied
now
they
see
that
no
indulgence
will
be
granted
them
which
they
hoped
for
and
that
the
bishop
of
london
hath
taken
good
care
that
places
are
supplied
with
very
good
and
able
men
which
is
the
only
thing
that
will
keep
all
quiet
at
noon
to
the
trinity
house
where
we
treated
very
dearly
i
believe
the
officers
of
the
ordnance
where
was
sir
compton
and
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
we
had
much
and
good
musique
sir
wm
compton
i
heard
talk
with
great
pleasure
of
the
difference
between
the
fleet
now
and
in
queene
elizabeth
days
where
in
she
had
but
sail
great
and
small

their
allowance
at
that
time

our
people

glad
of
to
mr

invitation
where
i
found

the
officers
of
the
customs

grave
fine
gentlemen

i
am
very
glad
to
know

during

ob
very
good
company
and
among
other
discourse
some
was
of
sir
jerom
bowes
embassador
from
queene
elizabeth
to
the
emperor
of
russia
in
the
object
of
his
mission
being
to
persuade
the
muscovite
to
a
peace
with
john
king
of
sweden
he
was
also
employed
to
confirm
the
trade
of
the
english
with
russia
and
having
incurred
some
personal
danger
was
received
with
favour
on
his
return
by
the
queen
he
died
in
there
is
a
portrait
of
him
in
lord
suffolk
collection
at
charlton
who
because
some
of
the
noblemen
there
would
go
to
the
emperor
before
him
he
would
not
go
up
till
the
emperor
had
ordered
those
two
men
to
be
dragged
with
their
heads
knocking
upon
every
stair
till
they
were
killed
and
when
he
was
come
up
they
demanded
his
sword
of
him
before
he
entered
the
room
he
told
them
if
they
would
have
his
sword
they
should
have
his
boots
too
and
so
caused
his
boots
to
be
pulled
off
and
his
gown
and
and
slippers
to
be
sent
for
and
made
the
emperor
stay
till
he
could
go
in
his
since
he
might
not
go
as
a
soldier
and
lastly
when
the
emperor
in
contempt
to
show
his
command
of
his
subjects
did
command
one
to
leap
from
the
window
down
and
broke
his
neck
in
the
sight
of
our
embassador
he
replied
that
his
mistress
did
set
more
by
and
did
make
better
use
of
the
necks
of
her
subjects
but
said
that
to
show
what
her
subjects
would
do
for
her
he
would
and
did
fling
down
his
gantlett
before
the
emperor
and
challenged
all
the
nobility
there
to
take
it
up
in
defence
of
the
emperor
against
his
queene
for
which
at
this
very
day
the
name
of
sir
jerom
bowes
is
famous
and
honoured
there
i
this
day
heard
that
martin
noell
is
knighted
by
the
king
which
i
much
wonder
at
but
yet
he
is
certainly
a
very
useful
man
home
with
fox
and
his
lady
and
there
dined
with
them
most
of
our
discourse
was
what
ministers
are
flung
out
that
will
not
conform
and
the
care
of
the
bishop
of
london
that
we
are
here
supplied
with
very
good
men
meeting
pierce
the
chyrurgeon
he
took
me
into
somersett
house
and
there
carried
me
into
the
where
she
was
with
our
own
queene
sitting
on
her
left
hand
whom
i
did
never
see
before
and
though
she
be
not
very
charming
yet
she
hath
a
good
modest
and
innocent
look
which
is
pleasing
here
i
also
saw
madam
castlemaine
and
which
pleased
me
most
crofts
james
son
of
charles
ii
by
lucy
waters
who
bore
the
name
of
crofts
till
he
was
created
duke
of
monmouth
in
previously
to
his
marriage
with
lady
anne
scot
daughter
to
francis
earl
of
buccleuch
the
king
bastard
a
most
pretty
sparke
of
about
years
old
who
i
perceive
do
hang
much
upon
my
lady
castlemaine
and
is
always
with
her
and
i
hear
the
queenes
both
are
mighty
kind
to
him
by
and
by
in
comes
the
king
and
anon
the
duke
and
his
duchesse
so
that
they
being
all
together
was
such
a
sight
as
i
never
could
almost
have
happened
to
see
with
so
much
ease
and
leisure
they
staid
till
it
was
dark
and
then
went
away
the
king
and
his
queene
and
my
lady
castlemaine
and
young
crofts
in
one
coach
and
the
rest
in
other
coaches
here
were
great
stores
of
great
ladies
but
very
few
handsome
the
king
and
queene
were
very
merry
and
he
would
have
made
the
believe
that
his
queene
was
with
child
and
said
that
she
said
so
and
the
young
queene
answered
you
lye
which
was
the
first
english
word
that
i
ever
heard
her
say
which
made
the
king
good
sport
and
he
would
have
made
her
say
in
english
confess
and
be
hanged
with
coventry
to
the
duke
who
after
he
was
out
of
his
bed
did
send
for
us
in
and
when
he
was
quite
ready
took
us
into
his
closet
and
there
told
us
that
he
do
intend
to
renew
the
old
custom
for
the
admirals
to
have
their
principal
officers
to
meet
them
once
to
give
them
an
account
what
they
have
done
that
week
which
i
am
glad
of
and
so
the
rest
did
tell
his
royal
highness
that
i
could
do
it
best
for
the
time
past
and
so
i
produced
my
short
notes
and
did
give
him
an
account
of
all
that
we
have
of
late
done
and
proposed
to
him
several
things
for
his
commands
which
he
did
give
us
and
so
dismissed
us
this
day
by
letters
from
my
father
i
hear
that
captn
ferrers
who
is
with
my
lord
in
the
country
was
at
brampton
with
creed
to
see
him
and
that
a
day
or
two
ago
being
provoked
to
strike
one
of
my
lord
footmen
the
footman
drew
his
sword
and
hath
almost
cut
the
fingers
of
one
of
his
hands
off
which
i
am
very
sorry
for
but
this
is
the
vanity
of
being
apt
to
command
and
strike
to
white
hall
chapel
where
sermon
almost
done
and
i
heard
captn
cooke
new
musique
this
the
first
day
of
having
vialls
and
other
instruments
to
play
a
symphony
between
every
verse
of
the
anthems
but
the
musique
more
full
than
it
was
the
last
sunday
and
very
fine
it
is
but
yet
i
could
discern
captn
cooke
to
overdo
his
part
at
singing
which
i
never
did
before
thence
up
into
the
queene
presence
and
there
saw
the
queene
again
as
i
did
last
sunday
and
some
fine
ladies
with
her
but
my
troth
not
many
thence
to
sir
carteret
by
water
with
sir
wm
pen
to
white
hall
and
with
much
ado
was
fain
to
walk
over
the
piles
through
the
bridge
while
sir
batten
and
sir
minnes
were
aground
against
the
bridge
and
could
not
in
a
great
while
get
through
at
white
hall
we
hear
that
the
duke
of
york
is
gone
and
so
we
returned
they
going
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
where
i
left
them
after
i
had
observed
a
very
good
picture
or
two
there
at
noon
sir
carteret
mr
coventry
and
i
by
invitation
to
dinner
to
sheriff
maynell
the
great
he
alderman
backewell
and
much
noble
and
brave
company
with
the
privilege
of
their
rare
discourse
which
is
great
content
to
me
above
all
other
things
in
the
world
and
after
a
great
dinner
and
much
discourse
we
took
leave
among
other
discourses
speaking
concerning
the
great
charity
used
in
catholique
countrys
ashburnham
did
tell
us
that
this
last
yeare
there
being
great
want
of
corne
in
paris
and
so
a
collection
made
for
the
poor
there
was
two
pearles
brought
in
nobody
knew
from
whom
till
the
queene
seeing
them
knew
whose
they
were
but
did
not
discover
it
which
were
sold
for
crownes
to
the
parke
the
queene
coming
by
in
her
coach
going
to
her
chapel
at
james
the
first
time
it
hath
been
ready
for
her
i
crowded
after
her
and
i
got
up
to
the
room
where
her
closet
is
and
there
stood
and
saw
the
fine
altar
ornaments
and
the
fryers
in
their
habits
and
the
priests
come
in
with
their
fine
crosses
and
many
other
fine
things
i
heard
their
musique
too
which
may
be
good
but
it
did
not
appear
so
to
me
neither
as
to
their
manner
of
singing
nor
was
it
good
concord
to
my
ears
whatever
the
matter
was
the
queene
very
devout
but
what
pleased
me
best
was
to
see
my
dear
lady
castlemaine
who
tho
a
protestant
did
wait
upon
the
queene
to
chapel
by
and
by
after
masse
was
done
a
fryer
with
his
cowl
did
rise
up
and
preach
a
sermon
in
portuguese
which
i
not
understanding
did
go
away
and
to
the
king
chapel
but
that
was
done
and
so
up
to
the
queene
where
she
and
the
king
was
expected
to
dine
but
she
staying
at
james
they
were
forced
to
remove
the
things
to
the
presence
and
there
he
dined
alone
sir
carteret
told
me
how
in
most
cabaretts
in
france
they
have
writ
upon
the
walls
in
fair
letters
to
be
read
dieu
te
regarde
as
a
good
lesson
to
be
in
every
man
mind
and
have
also
in
holland
their
poor
box
in
both
which
places
at
the
making
all
contracts
and
bargains
they
give
so
much
which
they
call
god
penny
to
my
lord
crewe
and
there
dined
alone
with
him
and
among
other
things
he
do
advise
me
by
all
means
to
keep
my
lord
sandwich
from
proceeding
too
far
in
the
business
of
tangier
first
for
that
he
is
confident
the
king
will
not
be
able
to
find
money
for
the
building
the
mole
and
next
for
that
it
is
to
be
done
as
we
propose
it
by
the
reducing
of
the
garrison
and
then
either
my
lord
must
oppose
the
duke
of
york
who
will
have
the
irish
regiment
under
the
command
of
fitzgerald
continued
or
else
my
lord
peterborough
who
is
concerned
to
have
the
english
continued
but
he
it
seems
is
gone
back
again
merely
upon
my
lord
sandwich
encouragement
to
the
french
church
at
the
savoy
and
there
they
have
the
common
prayer
book
read
in
french
and
which
i
never
saw
before
the
minister
do
preach
with
his
hat
off
i
suppose
in
further
conformity
with
our
church
to
coventry
and
so
with
him
and
sir
pen
up
to
the
duke
where
the
king
come
also
and
staid
till
the
duke
was
ready
it
being
we
had
no
time
to
talk
with
him
about
any
business
to
the
king
theatre
where
we
saw
midsummer
night
dream
which
i
had
never
seen
before
nor
shall
ever
again
for
it
is
the
most
insipid
ridiculous
play
that
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
my
condition
at
present
is
this
i
have
long
been
building
and
my
house
to
my
great
content
is
now
almost
done
my
lord
sandwich
has
lately
been
in
the
country
and
very
civil
to
my
wife
and
hath
himself
spent
some
pains
in
drawing
a
plot
of
some
alterations
in
our
house
there
which
i
shall
follow
as
i
get
money
as
for
the
office
my
late
industry
hath
been
such
as
i
am
become
as
high
in
reputation
as
any
man
there
and
good
hold
i
have
of
coventry
and
sir
carteret
which
i
am
resolved
and
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
maintain
by
all
fair
means
things
are
all
quiet
the
late
outing
of
the
presbyterian
clergy
by
their
not
renouncing
the
covenant
as
the
act
of
parliament
commands
is
the
greatest
piece
of
state
now
in
discourse
but
for
ought
i
see
they
are
gone
out
very
peaceably
and
the
people
not
so
much
concerned
therein
as
was
expected
october
at
night
hearing
that
there
was
a
play
at
the
cockpit
and
my
lord
sandwich
who
come
to
town
last
night
at
it
i
do
go
thither
and
by
very
great
fortune
did
follow
four
or
five
gentlemen
who
were
carried
to
a
little
private
door
in
a
wall
and
so
crept
through
a
narrow
place
and
come
into
one
of
the
boxes
next
the
king
but
so
as
i
could
not
see
the
king
or
queene
but
many
of
the
fine
ladies
who
yet
are
not
really
so
handsome
generally
as
i
used
to
take
them
to
be
but
that
they
are
finely
dressed
then
we
saw
the
cardinall
a
by
james
shirley
a
tragedy
i
had
never
seen
before
nor
is
there
any
great
matter
in
it
the
company
that
come
in
with
me
into
the
box
were
all
frenchmen
that
could
speak
no
english
but
lord
what
sport
they
made
to
ask
a
pretty
lady
that
they
got
among
them
that
understood
both
french
and
english
to
make
her
tell
them
what
the
actors
said
i
to
church
and
this
day
the
parson
has
got
one
to
read
with
a
surplice
on
i
suppose
himself
will
take
it
up
hereafter
for
a
cunning
fellow
he
is
as
any
of
his
coate
to
white
hall
with
coventry
and
so
to
my
lord
sandwich
lodgings
but
my
lord
not
within
being
at
a
ball
this
night
with
the
king
at
my
lady
castlemaine
at
next
door
to
my
lord
sandwich
and
among
other
things
to
my
extraordinary
joy
he
did
tell
me
how
much
i
was
beholding
to
the
duke
of
york
who
did
yesterday
of
his
own
accord
tell
him
that
he
did
thank
him
for
one
person
brought
into
the
navy
naming
myself
and
much
more
to
my
commendation
which
is
the
greatest
comfort
and
encouragement
that
ever
i
had
in
my
life
and
do
owe
it
all
to
coventry
goodness
and
ingenuity
at
night
by
coach
to
my
lord
again
but
he
is
at
white
hall
with
the
king
before
whom
the
puppet
plays
i
saw
this
summer
in
are
acted
this
night
to
the
office
and
i
bid
them
adieu
for
a
week
having
the
duke
leave
got
me
by
coventry
to
whom
i
did
give
thanks
for
my
news
yesterday
of
the
duke
words
to
my
lord
sandwich
concerning
me
which
he
took
well
and
do
tell
me
so
freely
his
love
and
value
of
me
that
my
mind
is
now
in
as
great
a
state
quiet
as
to
my
interest
in
the
office
as
i
could
ever
wish
to
be
between
one
and
two

on
horseback
at
our
back
gate
with
my
man
will
with
me
both

two
grey

so
i
resolved
to
ride
on

we
did
though
the
way
was
bad
and
the
evening
dark
before
we
got
thither
by
help
of

was
very
good
company
and
a
scholar
he
tells
me
that
it

consent
or
not
to
creed
chamber
and
there
sat
a
good
while
and
drank
chocolate
here
i
am
told
how
things
go
at
court
that
the
young
men
get
uppermost
and
the
old
serious
lords
are
out
of
favour
that
sir
bennet
being
brought
into
sir
edward
place
sir
charles
barkeley
is
made
privy
purse
a
most
vicious
person
and
one
whom
pierce
the
surgeon
did
tell
me
that
he
offered
his
wife
per
annum
to
be
his
mistress
he
also
told
me
that
none
in
court
hath
more
the
king
eare
now
than
sir
charles
barkeley
and
sir
bennet
and
my
lady
castlemaine
whose
interest
now
is
as
great
as

and
that

great
beauty

tells
me
also
that
my
lord
albans
is
like
to
be
lord
treasurer
all
which
things
do
trouble
me
much
put
on
my
first
new
and
so
neat
it
is
that
i
am
resolved
my
great
expence
shall
be
and
it
will
set
off
any
thing
else
the
more
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that
the
news
of
the
selling
of
dunkirke
is
taken
so
generally
ill
as
i
find
it
is
among
the
merchants
and
other
things
as
removal
of
officers
at
court
good
for
worse
and
all
things
else
made
much
worse
in
their
report
among
people
than
they
are
and
this
night
i
know
not
upon
what
ground
the
gates
of
the
city
ordered
to
be
all
shut
and
double
guards
every
where
indeed
i
do
find
every
body
spirit
very
full
of
trouble
and
the
things
of
the
court
and
council
very
ill
taken
so
as
to
be
apt
to
appear
in
bad
colours
if
there
should
ever
be
a
beginning
of
trouble
which
god
forbid
in
sir
minnes
coach
with
him
and
sir
batten
to
white
hall
where
now
the
duke
is
come
again
to
lodge
and
to
coventry
little
new
chamber
there
and
by
and
by
up
to
the
duke
who
was
making
himself
ready
and
there
young
killigrew
did
so
commend
the
villaine
a
new
play
made
by
tom
porter
and
acted
only
on
saturday
at
the
duke
house
as
if
there
never
had
been
any
such
play
come
upon
the
stage
the
same
yesterday
was
told
me
by
captn
ferrers
and
this
morning
afterwards
by
clarke
who
saw
it
after
i
had
done
with
the
duke
with
commissioner
pett
to
lilly
the
great
painter
who
come
forth
to
us
but
believing
that
i
come
to
bespeak
a
picture
he
prevented
it
by
telling
us
that
he
should
not
be
at
leisure
these
three
weeks
which
methinks
is
a
rare
thing
and
then
to
see
in
what
pomp
his
table
was
laid
for
himself
to
go
to
dinner
and
here
among
other
pictures
saw
the
so
much
desired
by
me
picture
of
my
lady
castlemaine
which
is
a
most
blessed
picture
and
one
that
i
must
have
a
copy
of
from
thence
i
took
my
wife
by
coach
to
the
duke
house
there
was
the
house
full
of
company
but
whether
it
was
in
overexpecting
or
what
i
know
not
but
i
was
never
less
pleased
with
a
play
in
my
life
though
there
was
good
singing
and
dancing
yet
no
fancy
in
the
play
by
water
with
smith
to
lechmore
the
councellor
at
the
temple
nicholas
lechmere
knighted
and
made
a
baron
of
the
exchequer
ob
about
field
business
and
he
tells
me
plainly
that
there
being
a
verdict
against
me
there
is
no
help
for
it
but
it
must
proceed
to
judgement
it
is
damage
to
me
for
my
joining
with
others
in
committing
field
to
prison
as
being
not
justices
of
the
peace
in
the
city
though
in
middlesex
which
troubled
me
and
i
hope
the
king
will
make
it
good
to
us
pierce
the
chyrurgeon
tells
me
how
ill
things
go
at
court
that
the
king
do
show
no
countenance
to
any
that
belong
to
the
queene
nor
above
all
to
such
english
as
she
brought
over
with
her
or
hath
here
since
for
fear
they
should
tell
her
how
he
carries
himself
to
palmer
insomuch
that
though
he
has
a
promise
and
is
sure
of
being
made
her
chyrurgeon
he
is
at
a
loss
what
to
do
in
it
whether
to
take
it
or
no
since
the
king
mind
is
so
altered
and
favor
to
all
her
dependents
whom
she
is
fain
to
let
go
back
into
portugall
though
she
brought
them
from
their
friends
against
their
wills
with
promise
of
preferment
without
doing
anything
for
them
that
her
owne
physician
did
tell
him
within
these
three
days
that
the
queene
do
know
how
the
king
orders
things
and
how
be
carries
himself
to
my
lady
castlemaine
and
others
as
well
as
any
body
but
though
she
hath
spirit
enough
yet
seeing
that
she
do
no
good
by
taking
notice
of
it
for
the
present
she
forbears
it
in
policy
of
which
i
am
very
glad
but
i
do
pray
god
keep
us
in
peace
for
this
with
other
things
do
give
great
discontent
to
all
people
put
on
my
new
scallop
which
is
very
fine
to
church
and
there
saw
the
first
time
mills
in
a
surplice
but
it
seemed
absurd
for
him
to
pull
it
over
his
eares
in
the
after
he
had
done
before
all
the
church
to
go
up
to
the
pulpitt
to
preach
without
it
all
this
day
soldiers
going
up
and
down
the
towne
there
being
an
alarme
and
many
quakers
and
other
clapped
up
but
i
believe
without
any
reason
only
they
say
in
dorsetshire
there
hath
been
some
rising
discovered
to
my
lord
sandwich
who
calls
me
into
his
chamber
and
alone
did
discourse
with
me
about
the
jealousy
that
the
court
have
of
people
rising
wherein
he
do
much
dislike
my
lord
monk
being
so
eager
against
a
company
of
poor
wretches
dragging
them
up
and
down
the
street
but
would
have
him
rather
take
some
of
the
greatest
ringleaders
of
them
and
punish
them
whereas
this
do
but
tell
the
world
the
king
fears
and
doubts
for
dunkirke
he
wonders
any
wise
people
should
be
so
troubled
thereat
and
scorns
all
their
talk
against
it
for
that
he
sees
it
was
not
dunkirke
but
the
other
places
that
did
and
would
annoy
us
though
we
had
that
as
much
as
if
we
had
it
not
he
also
took
notice
of
the
new
ministers
of
state
sir
bennet
and
sir
charles
barkeley
their
bringing
in
and
the
high
game
that
my
lady
castlemaine
plays
at
court
afterwards
he
told
me
of
poor
spong
that
being
with
other
people
examined
before
the
king
and
council
they
being
laid
up
as
suspected
persons
and
it
seems
spong
is
so
far
thought
guilty
as
that
they
intend
to
pitch
upon
him
to
put
to
the
wracke
or
some
other
torture
he
do
take
knowledge
of
my
lord
sandwich
and
said
that
he
was
well
known
to
pepys
but
my
lord
knows
and
i
told
him
that
it
was
only
in
matter
of
musique
and
pipes
but
that
i
thought
him
to
be
a
very
innocent
fellow
and
indeed
i
am
very
sorry
for
him
after
my
lord
and
i
had
done
in
private
we
went
out
and
with
captain
cuttance
and
bunn
did
look
over
their
draught
of
a
bridge
for
tangier
which
will
be
brought
by
my
desire
to
our
office
by
them
to
westminster
hall
and
there
walked
long
with
creed
he
showed
me
our
commission
wherein
the
duke
of
york
prince
rupert
duke
of
albemarle
lord
peterborough
lord
sandwich
sir
carteret
sir
william
compton
coventry
sir
ford
sir
william
rider
cholmley
povy
myself
and
captain
cuttance
in
this
order
are
joyned
for
the
carrying
on
the
service
of
tangier
he
told
me
what
great
faction
there
is
at
court
and
above
all
what
is
whispered
that
young
crofts
is
lawful
son
to
the
king
the
king
being
married
to
his
mother
how
true
this
is
god
knows
but
i
believe
the
duke
of
york
will
not
be
fooled
in
this
of
three
crowns
thence
to
white
hall
and
walked
long
in
the
gardens
till
as
they
are
commanded
to
all
strange
persons
one
come
to
tell
us
we
not
being
known
and
being
observed
to
walk
there
four
or
five
houres
which
was
not
true
unless
they
count
my
walking
there
in
the
morning
he
was
commanded
to
ask
who
we
were
which
being
told
he
excused
his
question
and
was
satisfied
these
things
speake
great
fear
and
jealousys
sir
carteret
who
had
been
at
the
examining
most
of
the
late
people
that
are
clapped
up
do
say
that
he
do
not
think
that
there
hath
been
any
great
plotting
among
them
though
they
have
a
good
will
to
it
and
their
condition
is
so
poor
and
silly
and
low
that
they
do
not
fear
them
at
all
to
my
lord
sandwich
who
was
up
in
his
chamber
and
all
alone
and
did
acquaint
me
with
his
business
which
was
that
our
old
acquaintance
wade
in
axe
yard
hath
discovered
to
him
hid
in
the
tower
of
which
he
was
to
have
two
for
discovery
my
lord
himself
two
and
the
king
the
other
three
when
it
was
found
and
that
the
king
warrant
runs
for
me
on
my
lord
part
and
one
lee
for
sir
harry
bennet
to
demand
leave
of
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
for
to
make
search
after
he
had
told
me
the
whole
business
i
took
leave
and
at
noon
comes
wade
with
my
lord
letter
so
we
consulted
for
me
to
go
first
to
sir
bennet
who
is
now
with
many
of
the
privy
counsellors
at
the
tower
examining
of
their
late
prisoners
to
advise
with
him
when
to
begin
so
i
went
and
the
guard
at
the
tower
gate
making
me
leave
my
sword
at
the
gate
i
was
forced
to
stay
so
long
in
the
close
by
till
my
boy
run
home
for
my
cloak
that
my
lord
mayor
that
now
is
sir
john
robinson
lieutenant
of
the
tower
with
all
his
company
was
gone
with
their
coaches
to
his
house
in
minchen
lane
so
my
cloak
being
come
i
walked
thither
and
there
by
sir
carteret
means
did
presently
speak
with
sir
bennet
who
did
give
me
the
king
warrant
for
the
paying
of
to
my
lord
and
other
two
to
the
discoverers
after
a
little
discourse
dinner
come
in
and
i
dined
with
them
there
was
my
lord
mayor
my
lord
lauderdale
secretary
morris
to
whom
sir
bennet
would
give
the
upper
hand
sir
wm
compton
sir
carteret
and
myself
and
some
other
company
and
a
brave
dinner
after
dinner
sir
bennet
did
call
aside
the
lord
mayor
and
me
and
did
break
the
business
to
him
who
did
not
nor
durst
appear
the
least
averse
to
it
but
did
promise
all
assistance
forthwith
to
set
upon
it
so
lee
and
i
to
our
office
and
there
walked
till
wade
and
one
evett
his
guide
did
come
and
griffin
and
a
porter
with
his
and
so
they
walked
along
with
us
to
the
tower
and
sir
bennet
and
my
lord
mayor
did
give
us
full
power
to
fall
to
work
so
our
guide
demands
a
candle
and
down
into
the
cellars
he
goes
enquiring
whether
they
were
the
same
that
baxter
alway
had
he
went
into
several
little
cellars
and
then
went
out
to
view
and
to
the
cole
harbour
but
none
did
answer
so
well
to
the
marks
which
was
given
him
to
find
it
by
as
one
arched
vault
where
after
a
great
deal
of
council
whether
to
set
upon
it
now
or
delay
for
better
and
more
full
advice
to
digging
we
went
till
almost
eight
at
night
but
could
find
nothing
but
however
our
guides
did
not
at
all
seem
discouraged
for
that
they
being
confident
that
the
money
is
there
they
look
for
but
having
never
been
in
the
cellars
they
could
not
be
positive
to
the
place
and
therefore
will
inform
themselves
more
fully
now
they
have
been
there
of
the
party
that
do
advise
them
so
locking
the
door
after
us
we
left
here
and
up
to
the
deputy
governor
my
lord
mayor
and
sir
bennet
with
the
rest
of
the
company
being
gone
an
hour
before
and
he
do
undertake
to
keep
the
key
of
the
cellars
that
none
shall
go
down
without
his
privity
but
lord
to
see
what
a
young
simple
fantastick
coxcombe
is
made
deputy
governor
would
make
me
mad
and
how
he
called
out
for
his
of
silk
only
to
make
a
show
to
us
and
yet
for
half
an
hour
i
did
not
think
he
was
the
deputy
governor
and
so
spoke
not
to
him
about
the
business
but
waited
for
another
man
but
at
last
i
broke
our
business
to
him
and
he
promising
his
care
we
parted
and
lee
and
i
by
coach
to
white
hall
where
i
did
give
my
lord
sandwich
a
full
account
of
our
proceedings
and
some
encouragement
to
hope
for
something
hereafter
this
morning
walking
with
coventry
in
the
garden
he
did
tell
me
how
sir
carteret
had
carried
the
business
of
the
victuallers
money
to
be
paid
by
himself
contrary
to
old
practice
at
which
he
is
angry
i
perceive
but
i
believe
means
no
hurt
but
that
things
may
be
done
as
they
ought
he
expects
sir
george
should
not
bespatter
him
privately
in
revenge
not
openly
against
which
he
prepares
to
bedaube
him
and
swears
he
will
do
it
from
the
beginning
from
jersey
to
this
day
but
as
to
his
own
taking
of
too
large
fees
or
rewards
for
places
that
he
had
sold
he
will
prove
that
he
was
directed
to
it
by
sir
george
himself
among
others
and
yet
he
did
not
deny
sir
carteret
his
due
in
saying
that
he
is
a
man
that
do
take
the
most
pains
and
gives
himself
the
most
to
do
business
of
any
about
the
court
without
any
desire
of
pleasure
or
divertisements
which
is
very
true
but
which
pleased
me
mightily
he
said
in
these
words
that
he
was
resolved
whatever
it
cost
him
to
make
an
experiment
and
see
whether
it
was
possible
for
a
man
to
keep
himself
up
in
court
by
dealing
plainly
and
walking
uprightly
in
the
doing
whereof
if
his
ground
do
slip
from
under
him
he
will
be
contented
but
he
is
resolved
to
try
and
never
to
baulke
taking
notice
of
anything
that
is
to
the
king
prejudice
let
it
fall
where
it
will
which
is
a
most
brave
resolution
he
was
very
free
with
me
and
by
my
troth
i
do
see
more
reall
worth
in
him
than
in
most
men
that
i
do
know
i
would
not
forget
two
passages
of
sir
minnes
at
dinner
the
one
that
to
the
question
how
it
comes
to
pass
that
there
are
no
boars
seen
in
london
but
many
sowes
and
pigs
it
was
answered
that
the
constable
gets
them
the
other
thos
killigrew
way
of
getting
to
see
plays
when
he
was
a
boy
he
would
go
to
the
red
bull
and
when
the
man
cried
to
the
boys
who
will
go
and
be
a
devil
and
he
shall
see
the
play
for
nothing
then
would
he
go
in
and
be
a
devil
upon
the
stage
and
so
get
to
see
plays
i
thank
god
i
have
no
crosses
but
only
much
business
to
trouble
my
mind
with
in
all
other
things
as
happy
a
man
as
any
in
the
world
for
the
whole
world
seems
to
smile
upon
me
and
if
my
house
were
done
that
i
could
diligently
follow
my
business
i
would
not
doubt
to
do
god
and
the
king
and
myself
good
service
and
all
i
do
impute
almost
wholly
to
my
late
temperance
since
my
making
of
my
vowes
against
wine
and
plays
which
keeps
me
most
happily
and
contentfully
to
my
business
which
god
continue
public
matters
are
full
of
discontent
what
with
the
sale
of
dunkirke
and
my
lady
castlemaine
and
her
faction
at
court
though
i
know
not
what
they
would
have
more
than
to
debauch
the
king
whom
god
preserve
from
it
and
then
great
plots
are
talked
to
be
discovered
and
all
the
prisons
in
towne
full
of
ordinary
people
taken
from
their
last
sunday
but
for
certain
some
plots
there
hath
been
though
not
brought
to
a
head
november
to
my
office
to
meet
lee
again
from
sir
bennet
and
he
and
i
with
wade
and
his
intelligencer
and
labourers
to
the
tower
cellars
to
make
one
triall
more
where
we
staid
two
or
three
hours
and
dug
a
great
deal
all
under
the
arches
as
it
was
now
most
confidently
directed
and
so
seriously
and
upon
pretended
good
grounds
that
i
myself
did
truly
expect
to
speed
but
we
missed
of
all
and
so
we
went
away
the
second
time
like
fools
and
to
our
office
and
i
by
appointment
to
the
dolphin
taverne
to
meet
wade
and
the
other
capt
evett
who
now
do
tell
me
plainly
that
he
that
do
put
him
upon
this
is
one
that
had
it
from
barkestead
own
mouth
and
was
advised
with
by
him
just
before
the
king
coming
in
how
to
get
it
out
and
had
all
the
signs
told
him
how
and
where
it
lay
and
had
always
been
the
great
confident
of
barkestead
even
to
the
trusting
him
with
his
life
and
all
he
had
so
that
he
did
much
convince
me
that
there
is
good
ground
for
what
he
goes
about
but
i
fear
it
may
be
that
he
did
find
some
conveyance
of
it
away
without
the
help
of
this
man
before
he
died
but
he
is
resolved
to
go
to
the
party
once
more
and
then
to
determine
what
we
shall
do
further
to
white
hall
to
the
duke
but
found
him
gone
thence
to
my
lord
sandwich
from
whom
i
receive
every
day
more
and
more
signs
of
his
confidence
and
esteem
of
me
here
i
met
with
pierce
the
chyrurgeon
who
tells
me
that
my
lady
castlemaine
is
with
child
but
though
it
be
the
king
yet
her
lord
being
still
in
towne
and
sometimes
seeing
of
her
it
will
be
laid
to
him
he
tells
me
also
how
the
duke
of
york
is
smitten
in
love
with
my
lady
chesterfield
lady
elizabeth
butler
daughter
of
james
duke
of
ormond
married
philip
second
earl
of
chesterfield
ob
vide
memoires
de
grammont
a
virtuous
lady
daughter
to
my
lord
of
ormond
and
so
much
that
the
duchesse
of
york
hath
complained
to
the
king
and
her
father
about
it
and
my
lady
chesterfield
is
gone
into
the
country
for
it
at
all
which
i
am
sorry
but
it
is
the
effect
of
idlenesse
and
having
nothing
else
to
employ
their
great
spirits
upon
at
night
to
my
office
and
did
business
and
there
come
to
me
wade
and
evett
who
have
been
again
with
their
prime
intelligencer
a
woman
i
perceive
and
though
we
have
missed
twice
yet
they
bring
such
an
account
of
the
probability
of
the
truth
of
the
thing
though
we
are
not
certain
of
the
place
that
we
shall
set
upon
it
once
more
and
i
am
willing
and
hopefull
in
it
so
we
resolved
to
set
upon
it
again
on
wednesday
morning
and
the
woman
herself
will
be
there
in
a
disguise
and
confirm
us
in
the
place
this
morning
we
had
news
by
letters
that
sir
richard
stayner
is
dead
at
sea
in
the
mary
which
is
now
come
into
portsmouth
from
lisbon
which
we
are
sorry
for
he
being
a
very
stout
seaman
being
by
appointment
called
upon
by
lee
he
and
i
to
the
tower
to
make
our
third
attempt
upon
the
cellar
and
now
privately
the
woman
barkestead
great
confident
is
brought
who
do
positively
say
that
this
is
the
place
which
he
did
say
the
money
was
hid
in
and
where
he
and
she
did
put
up
the
in
butter
firkins
and
the
very
day
that
he
went
out
of
england
did
say
that
neither
he
nor
his
would
be
the
better
for
that
money
and
therefore
wishing
that
she
and
hers
might
and
so
left
us
and
we
full
of
hope
did
resolve
to
dig
all
over
the
cellar
which
by
seven
at
night
we
performed
at
noon
we
sent
for
a
dinner
and
upon
the
head
of
a
barrel
dined
very
merrily
and
to
work
again
but
at
last
we
saw
we
were
mistaken
and
after
digging
the
cellar
quite
through
and
removing
the
barrels
from
one
side
to
the
other
we
were
forced
to
pay
our
porters
and
give
over
our
expectations
though
i
do
believe
there
must
be
money
hid
somewhere
by
him
or
else
he
did
delude
this
woman
in
hopes
to
oblige
her
to
further
serving
him
which
i
am
apt
to
believe
walked
to
my
brother
where
my
wife
is
calling
at
many
churches
and
then
to
the
temple
hearing
a
bit
there
too
and
observing
that
in
the
streets
and
churches
the
sunday
is
kept
in
appearance
as
well
as
i
have
known
it
at
any
time
a
little
to
the
office
and
so
with
sir
minnes
sir
batten
and
myself
by
coach
to
white
hall
to
the
duke
who
after
he
was
ready
did
take
us
into
his
closett
thither
come
my
lord
general
monk
and
did
privately
talk
with
the
duke
about
having
the
pass
through
the
city
only
for
show
and
to
fright
people
for
perceive
there
are
great
fears
abroad
for
all
which
i
am
troubled
and
full
of
doubt
that
things
will
not
go
well
he
being
gone
we
fell
to
business
of
the
navy
among
other
things
how
to
pay
off
this
fleet
that
is
now
come
from
portugall
the
king
of
portugall
sending
them
home
he
having
no
more
use
for
them
which
we
wonder
at
that
his
condition
should
be
so
soon
altered
and
our
landmen
also
are
coming
back
being
almost
starved
in
that
poor
country
to
my
lord
crewe
and
dined
with
him
and
his
brother
i
know
not
his
name
where
very
good
discourse
among
others
of
intention
to
make
a
patriarch
of
his
own
independent
from
the
pope
by
which
he
will
be
able
to
cope
with
the
spaniard
in
all
councils
which
hitherto
he
has
never
done
my
lord
crewe
told
us
how
he
heard
my
lord
of
holland
henry
rich
earl
of
holland
say
that
being
embassador
about
the
match
with
the
that
now
is
the
king
of
france
insisted
upon
a
dispensation
from
the
pope
which
my
lord
holland
making
a
question
of
as
he
was
commanded
to
yield
to
nothing
to
the
prejudice
of
our
religion
says
the
king
of
france
you
need
not
fear
that
for
if
the
pope
will
not
dispense
with
the
match
my
bishop
of
paris
shall
by
and
by
come
in
the
great
swinfen
john
swinfen
for
tamworth
the
who
among
other
discourse
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
familys
told
us
of
bishop
bridgeman
john
bridgeman
bishop
of
chester
father
of
sir
orlando
who
lately
hath
bought
a
seat
anciently
of
the
levers
and
then
the
ashtons
and
so
he
hath
in
his
great
hall
window
having
repaired
and
beautified
the
house
caused
four
great
places
to
be
left
for
coates
of
armes
in
one
he
hath
put
the
levers
with
this
motto
olim
in
another
the
ashtons
with
this
heri
in
the
next
his
own
with
this
hodie
in
the
fourth
nothing
but
this
motto
cras
nescio
cujus
the
towne
i
hear
is
full
of
discontents
and
all
know
of
the
king
new
bastard
by
haslerigge
and
as
far
as
i
can
hear
will
never
be
contented
with
episcopacy
they
are
so
cruelly
set
for
presbytery
and
the
bishops
carry
themselves
so
high
that
they
are
never
likely
to
gain
anything
upon
them
to
the
dolphin
tavern
near
home
by
appointment
and
there
met
with
wade
and
evett
and
have
resolved
to
make
a
new
attempt
upon
another
discovery
in
which
god
give
us
better
fortune
than
in
the
other
but
i
have
great
confidence
that
there
is
no
cheat
in
these
people
but
that
they
go
upon
good
grounds
though
they
have
been
mistaken
in
the
place
of
the
first
to
my
office
and
there
this
afternoon
me
had
our
first
meeting
upon
our
commission
of
inspecting
the
chest

francis
clerke
for
rochester
heath
atturney
of
the
dutchy
prinn
sir
rider
captn
cooke
and
myself
our
first
work
was
to
read
over
the
institution
which
is
a
decree
in
chancery
in
the
year
upon
an
inquisition
made
at
rochester
about
that
time
into
the
revenues
of
the
chest
which
had
then
from
the
year
or
by
the
advice
of
the
lord
high
admiral
and
principal
officers
then
being
by
consent
of
the
seamen
been
settled
paying
sixpence
per
month
according
to
their
wages
then
which
was
then
but
which
is
now

at
white
hall
by
appointment
creed

my
wife
and
i
to
the
cockpitt
and
we
had
excellent
places
and
saw
the
king
queene
duke
of
monmouth
his
son
and
my
lady
castlemaine
and
all
the
fine
ladies
and
the
scornfull
lady

performed
they
had
done
by
eleven

fine
moonshine
we
took
coach
and
home
late
at
my
office
drawing
up
a
letter
to
my
lord

we
have
been

about
after

the

my
lord
chief
baron
sir
edward
hale
sir
matthew
hale
succeeded
sir
orlando
bridgeman
as
chief
baron
of
the
exchequer
according
to
beatson
in
there
is
consequently
some
mistake
and
take
thurland
to
his
chamber
where
he
told
us
that
field
will
have
the
better
of
us
and
that
we
must
study
to
make
up
the
business
as
well
as
we
can
which
do
much
vex
and
trouble
us
but
i
am
glad
the
duke
is
concerned
in
it
this
day
come
the
king
from
calais
with
the
dunkirke

highly
honoured
i

to
one
among
others
one
davis
my
old
schoolfellow
at
paul
and
since
a
bookseller
in
paul
church
yard
and
it
seems
do
forgive
one
man
which
he
had
wronged
him
of
but
names
not

name
but
it
is
well
known
to
be
the
scrivener

at
whose
house
he
lodged
there
is
also
this

dead
a
poulterer

and
jacobs

gold
sir
minnes
sir

and
i
going
forth
toward

hall
we
hear
that
the
king
and
duke
are
come
this
morning
to
the
tower
to
see
the
dunkirke
money
so
we
by
coach
to
them
and
there
went
up
and
down
all
the
magazines
with
them
but
methought
it
was
but
poor
discourse
and
frothy
that
the
companions
young
killigrew
among
the
rest
had
with
him
we
saw
none
of
the
money
but
slingslby
did
show
the
king
and
i
did
see
the
stamps
of
the
new
money
that
is
now
to
be
made
by
blondeau
fashion
which
are
very
neat
and
like
the
king
thence
the
king
to
woolwich
though
a
very
cold
day
and
the
duke
to
white
hall
commanding
us
to
come
after
him
and
in
his
closet
my
lord
sandwich
being
there
did
discourse
with
us
about
getting
some
of
this
money
to
pay
off
the
fleets
and
other
matters
great
talk
among
people
how
some
of
the
fanatiques
do
say
that
the
end
of
the
world
is
at
hand
and
that
next
tuesday
is
to
be
the
day
against
which
whenever
it
shall
be
good
god
fit
us
all
at
my
waking
i
found
the
tops
of
the
houses
covered
with
snow
which
is
a
rare
sight
which
i
have
not
seen
these
three
years
to
the
office
where
we
sat
till
noon
when
we
all
went
to
the
next
house
upon
tower
hill
to
see
the
coming
by
of
the
russian
embassador
for
whose
reception
all
the
city
trained
bands
do
attend
in
the
streets
and
the
king
and
most
of
the
wealthy
citizens
in
their
black
velvet
coats
and
gold
chains
which
remain
of
their
gallantry
at
the
coming
in
but
they
staid
so
long
that
we
went
down
again
to
dinner
and
after
i
had
dined
i
walked
to
the
conduit
in
the
quarrefowr
at
the
end
of
and
cornhill
and
there
the
spouts
thereof
running
very
near
me
upon
all
the
people
that
were
under
it
i
saw
them
pretty
well
go
by
i
could
not
see
the
embassador
in
his
coach
but
his
attendants
in
their
habits
and
fur
caps
very
handsome
comely
men
and
most
of
them
with
hawkes
upon
their
fists
to
present
to
the
king
but
lord
to
see
the
absurd
nature
of
englishmen
that
can
not
forbear
laughing
and
jeering
at
every
thing
that
looks
strange
a
very
hard
frost
which
is
news
to
us
after
having
none
almost
these
three
years
by
ten
to
ironmongers
hall
to
the
funeral
of
sir
richard
stayner
here
we
were
all
the
officers
of
the
navy
and
my
lord
sandwich
who
did
discourse
with
us
about
the
fishery
telling
us
of
his
majesty
resolution
to
give
to
every
man
that
will
set
out
a
brisse
a
small
used
by
the
hollanders
for
the
and
advising
about
the
effects
of
this
encouragement
which
will
be
a
very
great
matter
certainly
here
we
had
good
rings
to
the
office
and
this
morning
come
sir
carteret
to
us
being
the
first
time
since
his
coming
from
france
he
tells
us
that
the
silver
which
is
received
for
dunkirke
did
weigh
weight
to
my
lord
where
my
lord
and
coventry
sir
wm
darcy
third
son
of
sir
conyers
darcy
summoned
to
parliament
as
lord
darcy
one
parham
a
very
knowing
and
man
in
this
business
with
several
others
did
meet
about
stating
the
business
of
the
fishery
and
the
manner
of
the
king
giving
of
this
to
every
man
that
shall
set
out
a
english
brisse
by
the
middle
of
june
next
in
which
business
we
had
many
fine
pretty
discourses
and
i
did
here
see
the
great
pleasure
to
be
had
in
discoursing
of
publick
matters
with
men
that
are
particularly
acquainted
with
this
or
that
business
having
come
to
some
issue
wherein
a
motion
of
mine
was
well
received
about
sending
these
invitations
from
the
king
to
all
the
in
general
with
limiting
so
many
brisses
to
this
and
that
port
before
we
know
the
readiness
of
subscribers
we
parted
publick
matters
in
an
ill
condition
of
discontent
against
the
height
and
vanity
of
the
court
and
their
bad
payments
but
that
which
troubles
most
is
the
clergy
which
will
never
content
the
city
which
is
not
to
be
reconciled
to
bishopps
but
more
the
pity
that
differences
must
still
be
dunkirke
newly
sold
and
the
money
brought
over
of
which
we
hope
to
get
some
to
pay
the
navy
which
by
sir
lawson
having
dispatched
the
business
in
the
straights
by
making
peace
with
argier
tunis
and
tripoli
and
so
his
fleet
will
also
shortly
come
home
will
now
every
day
grow
less
and
so
the
king
charge
be
abated
which
god
send
december
to
my
lord
sandwich
to
moore
and
then
over
the
parke
where
i
first
in
my
life
it
being
a
great
frost
did
see
people
sliding
with
their
skeates
which
is
a
very
pretty
art
to
coventry
s
chamber
to
james
where
we
all
met
to
a
venison
pasty
major
norwood
being
with
us
whom
they
did
play
upon
for
his
surrendering
of
dunkirke
here
we
staid
till
three
or
four
and
so
to
the
council
chamber
where
there
met
the
duke
of
york
prince
rupert
duke
of
albermarle
my
lord
sandwich
sir
wm
compton
coventry
sir
minnes
sir
ford
sir
rider
myself
and
captain
cuttance
as
commissioners
for
tangier
and
after
our
commission
was
read
by
creed
who
i
perceive
is
to
be
our
secretary
we
did
fall
to
discourse
of
matters
as
first
the
supplying
them
forthwith
with
victualls
then
the
reducing
it
to
make
way
for
the
money
which
upon
their
reduction
is
to
go
to
the
building
of
the
molle
and
so
to
other
matters
ordered
as
against
next
meeting
to
deptford
and
so
by
water
with
pett
home
again
all
the
way
reading
his
chest
accounts
in
which
i
did
see
things
which
did
not
please
me
as
his
allowing
himself
for
one
year
looking
to
the
business
of
the
chest
and
per
annum
for
the
rest
of
the
years
but
i
found
no
fault
to
him
himself
but
shall
when
they
come
to
be
read
at
the
board
we
walked
to
the
temple
in
our
way
seeing
one
of
the
russian
coaches
go
along
with
his
footmen
not
in
liverys
but
their
country
habits
one
of
one
colour
and
another
of
another
which
was
very
strange
i
walked
towards
guildhall
being
summoned
by
the
commissioners
for
the
lieutenancy
but
they
sat
not
this
morning
so
meeting
in
my
way
swan
i
took
him
to
a
house
thereabouts
he
telling
me
much
of
his
fanatique
stories
as
if
he
were
a
great
zealot
when
i
know
him
to
be
a
very
rogue
but
i
do
it
for
discourse
and
to
see
how
things
stand
with
him
and
his
party
who
i
perceive
have
great
expectation
that
god
will
not
bless
the
court
nor
church
as
it
is
now
settled
but
they
must
be
purified
the
worst
news
he
tells
me
is
that
chetwind
is
dead
my
old
and
most
ingenious
acquaintance
to
the
duke
where
the
committee
for
tangier
met
and
here
we
sat
down
all
with
him
at
a
table
and
had
much
discourse
about
the
business
we
sat
coventry
and
i
sir
carteret
being
gone
and
among
other
things
field
and
strip
did
come
and
received
the
given
him
by
the
judgement
against
me
and
harry
kem
and
we
did
also
sign
bonds
in
to
stand
to
the
award
of
porter
and
smith
for
the
rest
which
however
i
did
not
sign
to
till
i
got
coventry
to
go
up
with
me
to
sir
pen
and
he
did
promise
me
before
him
to
bear
his
share
in
what
should
be
awarded
and
both
concluded
that
sir
batten
would
do
no
less
to
the
duke
and
followed
him
into
the
parke
where
though
the
broken
and
dangerous
yet
he
would
go
slide
upon
his
scates
which
i
did
not
like
but
he
slides
very
well
so
back
to
his
closet
whither
my
lord
sandwich
comes
and
there
coventry
and
we
three
had
long
discourse
together
about
the
matters
of
the
navy
and
indeed
i
find
myself
more
and
more
obliged
to
coventry
who
studies
to
do
me
all
the
right
he
can
in
every
thing
to
the
duke
thence
walked
a
good
while
up
and
down
the
gallerys
and
among
others
met
with
clarke
who
in
discourse
tells
me
that
sir
charles
barkeley
greatness
is
only
his
being
pimp
to
the
king
and
to
my
lady
castlemaine
and
yet
for
all
this
that
the
king
is
very
kind
to
the
queene
who
he
says
is
one
of
the
best
women
in
the
world
strange
how
the
king
is
bewitched
to
this
pretty
castlemaine
i
walked
up
and
down
the
gallerys
spending
my
time
upon
the
pictures
till
the
duke
and
the
committee
for
tangier
met
the
duke
not
staying
with
us
where
the
only
matter
was
to
discourse
with
my
lord
rutherford
andrew
created
baron
of
rutherford
and
earl
of
teviot
successively
governor
of
dunkirk
and
tangier
where
he
was
killed
by
the
moors
in
who
is
this
day
made
governor
of
tangier
for
i
know
not
what
reasons
and
my
lord
of
peterborough
to
be
called
home
which
though
it
is
said
it
is
done
with
kindness
i
am
sorry
to
see
a
catholicke
governor
sent
to
command
there
where
all
the
rest
of
the
officers
almost
are
such
already
but
god
knows
what
the
reason
is
and
all
may
see
how
slippery
places
all
courtiers
stand
in
thence
home
in
my
way
calling
upon
sir
john
berkenheade
sir
john
berkenhead
a
political
author
held
in
some
esteem
for
wilton
and
knighted
the
following
year
master
of
the
faculty
office
and
court
of
requests
ob
to
speak
about
my
assessment
of
to
the
loyal
sufferers
which
i
perceive
i
can
not
help
but
he
tells
me
i
have
been
abused
by
sir
ford
thence
called
at
the
sir
browne
about
my
being
assessed
armes
to
the
militia
but
he
was
abroad
to
dinner
thinking
to
have
had
coventry
but
he
could
not
go
with
me
and
so
i
took
captn
murford
of
whom
i
do
hear
what
the
world
says
of
me
that
all
do
conclude
coventry
and
pett
and
me
to
be
of
a
knot
and
that
we
do
now
carry
all
things
before
us
and
much
more
in
particular
of
me
and
my
studiousnesse
to
my
great
content
to
white
hall
to
secretary
bennet
and
agreed
with
lee
to
set
upon
our
new
adventure
at
the
tower
this
morning
come
lee
wade
and
evett
intending
to
have
gone
upon
our
new
design
to
the
tower
but
it
raining
and
the
work
being
to
be
done
in
the
open
garden
we
put
it
off
to
friday
next
up
and
by
appointment
with
lee
wade
evett
and
workmen
to
the
tower
and
with
the
lieutenant
leave
set
them
to
work
in
the
garden
in
the
corner
against
the
a
most
unlikely
place
it
being
cold
lee
and
i
did
sit
all
the
day
till
three
by
the
fire
in
the
governor
house
i
reading
a
play
of
fletcher
being
a
wife
for
a
month
wherein
no
great
wit
or
language
we
went
to
them
at
work
and
having
wrought
below
the
bottom
of
the
foundation
of
the
wall
i
bid
them
give
over
and
so
all
our
hopes
ended
to
the
office
and
thence
with
coventry
in
his
coach
to
james
with
great
content
and
pride
to
see
him
treat
me
so
friendly
and
dined
with
him
and
so
to
white
hall
together
where
we
met
upon
the
tangier
commission
and
discoursed
many
things
thereon
but
little
will
be
done
before
my
lord
rutherford
comes
there
as
to
the
fortification
and
mole
that
done
my
lord
sandwich
and
i
walked
together
a
good
while
in
the
matted
gallery
he
acquainting
me
with
his
late
enquiries
into
the
wardrobe
business
to
his
content
and
tells
me
how
things
stand
and
that
the
first
year
was
worth
about
to
him
and
the
next
about
as
much
so
that
at
this
day
if
he
were
paid
it
will
be
worth
about
to
him
to
white
hall
and
there
to
chapel
and
from
thence
up
stairs
and
up
and
down
the
house
and
gallerys
on
the
king
and
queen
side
and
so
through
the
garden
to
my
lord
lodgings
where
there
was
gibbons
madge
mallard
and
pagett
and
by
and
by
comes
in
my
lord
sandwich
and
so
we
had
great
store
of
good
musique
by
and
by
comes
in
my
simple
lord
chandois
william
seventh
lord
chandos
who
my
lord
sandwich
being
to
court
began
to
sing
psalms
but
so
dully
that
i
was
weary
of
it
i
walked
to
coventry
chamber
where
i
found
him
gone
out
into
the
parke
with
the
duke
so
i
shifted
myself
into
a
and
followed
him
through
white
hall
and
in
the
parke
coventry
people
having
a
horse
ready
for
me
so
fine
a
one
that
i
was
almost
afraid
to
get
upon
him
but
i
did
and
found
myself
more
feared
than
hurt
and
followed
the
duke
who
with
some
of
his
people
among
others
coventry
was
riding
out
and
with
them
to
hide
parke
where
coventry
asking
leave
of
the
duke
he
bids
us
go
to
woolwich
so
he
and
i
to
the
and
our
horses
coming
by
the
ferry
we
by
oars
over
to
lambeth
and
from
thence
with
brave
discourse
by
the
way
rode
to
woolwich
where
we
put
in
practice
my
new
way
of
the
which
will
be
of
great
use
pierce
tells
me
that
my
lady
castlemaine
interest
at
court
increases
and
is
more
and
greater
than
the
queene
that
she
hath
brought
in
sir
bennet
and
sir
charles
barkeley
but
that
the
queene
is
a
most
good
lady
and
takes
all
with
the
greatest
meekness
that
may
be
he
tells
me
also
that
edward
montagu
is
quite
broke
at
court
with
his
repute
and
purse
and
that
he
lately
was
engaged
in
a
quarrell
against
my
lord
chesterfield
but
that
the
king
did
cause
it
to
be
taken
up
he
tells
me
too
that
the
king
is
much
concerned
in
the
chancellor
sickness
and
that
the
chancellor
is
as
great
he
thinks
as
ever
with
the
king
he
also
tells
me
what
the
world
says
of
me
that
coventry
and
i
do
all
the
business
of
the
office
almost
at
which
i
am
highly
proud
to
my
bookseller
and
paid
at
another
shop
for
stephens
thesaurus
graecae
linguae
given
to
paul
schoole
to
my
lord
crewe
and
dined
alone
with
him
i
understand
there
are
great
factions
at
court
and
something
he
said
that
did
imply
a
difference
like
to
be
between
the
king
and
the
duke
in
case
the
queene
should
not
be
with
child
i
understand
about
this
bastard
he
says
also
that
some
great
man
will
be
aimed
at
when
parliament
comes
to
sit
again
i
understand
the
chancellor
and
that
there
is
a
bill
will
be
brought
in
that
none
that
have
been
in
armes
for
the
parliament
shall
be
capable
of
office
and
that
the
court
are
weary
of
my
lord
albemarle
and
chamberlin
edward
earl
of
manchester
he
wishes
that
my
lord
sandwich
had
some
good
occasion
to
be
abroad
this
summer
which
is
coming
on
and
that
my
lord
hinchingbroke
were
well
married
and
sydney
lord
sandwich
second
son
had
some
place
at
court
he
pities
the
poor
ministers
that
are
put
out
to
whom
he
says
the
king
is
beholden
for
his
coming
in
and
that
if
any
such
thing
had
been
foreseen
he
had
never
come
in
met
creed
at
my
bookseller
in
paul
who
takes
it
ill
my
letter
last
night
to
povy
wherein
i
accuse
him
of
the
neglect
of
the
tangier
boats
in
which
i
must
confess
i
did
not
do
altogether
like
a
friend
but
however
it
was
truth
and
i
must
owne
it
to
be
so
though
i
fall
wholly
out
with
him
for
it
had
a
pleasant
walk
to
white
hall
where
i
intended
to
have
received
the
communion
with
the
family
but
i
come
a
little
too
late
so
i
walked
up
into
the
house
and
spent
my
time
looking
over
pictures
particularly
the
ships
in
king
henry
the
viiith
voyage
to
bullaen
boulogne
marking
the
great
difference
between
those
built
then
and
now
by
and
by
down
to
the
chapel
again
where
bishop
morley
george
morley
bishop
of
winchester
to
which
see
he
was
translated
from
worcester
in
ob
preached
upon
the
song
of
the
angels
glory
to
god
on
high
on
earth
peace
and
good
will
towards
men
methought
he
made
but
a
poor
sermon
but
long
and
reprehending
the
common
jollity
of
the
court
for
the
true
joy
that
shall
and
ought
to
be
on
these
days
particularized
concerning
their
excess
in
playes
and
gaming
saying
that
he
whose
office
it
is
to
keep
the
gamesters
in
order
and
within
bounds
serves
but
for
a
second
rather
in
a
duell
meaning
the
upon
which
it
was
worth
observing
how
far
they
are
come
from
taking
the
reprehensions
of
a
bishop
seriously
that
they
all
laugh
in
the
chapel
when
he
reflected
on
their
ill
actions
and
courses
he
did
much
press
us
to
joy
in
these
publick
days
of
joy
and
to
hospitality
but
one
that
stood
by
whispered
in
my
eare
that
the
bishop
do
not
spend
one
groate
to
the
poor
himself
the
sermon
done
a
good
anthem
followed
with
vialls
and
the
king
come
down
to
receive
the
sacrament
to
the
wardrobe
hither
come
battersby
and
we
falling
into
discourse
of
a
new
book
of
drollery
in
use
called
hudebras
i
would
needs
go
find
it
out
and
met
with
it
at
the
temple
cost
me
but
when
i
come
to
read
it
it
is
so
silly
an
abuse
of
the
presbyter
knight
going
to
the
warrs
that
i
am
ashamed
of
it
and
by
and
by
meeting
at
townsend
at
dinner
i
sold
it
to
him
for
with
my
wife
to
the
duke
theatre
and
saw
the
second
part
of
rhodes
the
siege
of
rhodes
a
in
two
parts
by
sir
wm
davenant
done
with
the
new
roxalana
an
actress
whose
name
is
unknown
but
she
had
been
seduced
by
the
earl
of
oxford
and
had
recently
quitted
the
stage
for
her
history
vide
memoires
de
grammont
which
do
it
rather
better
in
all
respects
for
person
voice
and
judgment
than
the
first
roxalana
to
westminster
hall
where
i
staid
reading
at
mitchell
shop
she
told
me
what
i
heard
not
of
before
the
strange
burning
of
de
laun
a
merchant
house
in
lothbury
and
his
lady
sir
thomas
allen
daughter
sir
thomas
alleyne
lord
mayor
of
london
and
her
whole
family
not
one
thing
dog
nor
cat
escaping
nor
any
of
the
neighbours
almost
hearing
of
it
till
the
house
was
quite
down
and
burnt
how
this
should
come
to
passe
god
knows
but
a
most
strange
thing
it
is
hither
come
jack
spicer
and
talked
of
exchequer
matters
and
how
the
lord
treasurer
hath
now
ordered
all
monies
to
be
brought
into
the
exchequer
and
hath
settled
the
king
revenues
and
given
to
every
general
expence
proper
assignments
to
the
navy
and
odde
he
also
told
me
of
the
great
vast
trade
of
the
goldsmiths
in
supplying
the
king
with
money
at
dear
rates
thence
to
white
hall
and
got
up
to
the
top
gallerys
in
the
banquetting
house
to
see
the
audience
of
the
russia
embassador
which
took
place
after
our
long
waiting
and
fear
of
the
falling
of
the
gallery
it
being
so
full
and
part
of
it
being
parted
from
the
rest
for
nobody
to
come
up
merely
from
the
weaknesse
thereof
and
very
handsome
it
was
after
they
had
come
in
i
went
down
and
got
through
the
croude
almost
as
high
as
the
king
and
the
embassadors
where
i
saw
all
the
presents
being
rich
furs
hawkes
carpets
cloths
of
tissue
and
teeth
the
king
took
two
or
three
hawkes
upon
his
fist
having
a
glove
on
wrought
with
gold
given
him
for
the
purpose
the
son
of
one
of
the
embassadors
was
in
the
richest
suit
for
pearl
and
tissue
that
ever
i
did
see
or
shall
i
believe
after
they
and
all
the
company
had
kissed
the
king
hand
then
the
three
embassadors
and
the
son
and
no
more
did
kiss
the
queene
one
thing
more
i
did
observe
that
the
chief
embassador
did
carry
up
his
master
letters
in
state
before
him
on
high
and
as
soon
as
he
had
delivered
them
he
did
fall
down
to
the
ground
and
lay
there
a
great
while
after
all
was
done
the
company
broke
up
and
i
spent
a
little
while
walking
up
and
down
the
gallery
seeing
the
ladies
the
two
queenes
and
the
duke
of
monmouth
with
his
little
mistress
lady
anne
scot
which
is
very
little
and
like
my
wife
visited
ferrer
and
staid
talking
with
her
a
good
while
there
being
a
little
proud
ugly
talking
lady
there
that
was
much
crying
up
the
court
at
somerset
house
above
our
own
queene
there
being
before
her
no
allowance
of
laughing
and
the
mirth
that
is
at
the
other
and
indeed
it
is
observed
that
the
greatest
court
is
there
thence
to
white
hall
where
i
carried
my
wife
to
see
the
queene
in
her
and
the
maydes
of
honour
and
the
young
duke
of
monmouth
playing
at
cards

of
them
and
but
a
few

very
pretty
though
all
well
dressed
in
velvet
gowns

and
i
to
white

he
taking
me
thither
on
purpose
to
carry
me
into
the
ball
this
night
before
the
king
he
brought
me
first
to
the
duke
chamber
where
i
saw
him
and
the
duchesse
at
supper
and
thence
into
the
room
where
the
ball
was
to
be
crammed
with
fine
ladies

greatest
of
the
court
by
and
by
comes
the
king
and
queene

single
coranto
and
then
the
rest
of
the
lords
one
after
another
other

very
noble

pleasure
to

degree
of
knowledge
therein
and
am
acknowledged
so
by
all
the
world
even
the
duke
himself
to
whom
i
have
a
good
accesse
and
by
that
and
by
my
being
commissioner
for
tangier
he
takes
much
notice
of
me
and
i
doubt
not
but
by
the
continuance
of
the
same
endeavours
i
shall
in
a
little
time
come
to
be
a
man
much
taken
notice
of
in
the
world
specially
being
come
to
so
great
an
esteem
with
coventry
publick
matters
stand
thus
the
king
is
bringing
as
is
said
his
family
and
navy
and
all
other
his
charges
to
a
less
expence
in
the
mean
time
himself
following
his
pleasures
more
than
with
good
advice
he
would
do
at
least
to
be
seen
to
all
the
world
to
do
so
his
dalliance
with
my
lady
castlemaine
being
publick
every
day
to
his
great
reproach
and
his
favouring
of
none
at
court
so
much
as
those
that
are
the
confidants
of
his
pleasure
as
sir
bennet
and
sir
charles
barkeley
which
good
god
put
it
into
his
heart
to
mend
before
he
makes
himself
too
much
contemned
by
his
people
for
it
the
duke
of
monmouth
is
in
so
great
splendour
at
court
and
so
dandled
by
the
king
that
some
doubt
that
if
the
king
should
have
no
child
by
the
queene
which
there
is
yet
no
appearance
of
whether
he
would
not
be
acknowledged
for
a
lawful
son
and
that
there
will
be
a
difference
follow
between
the
duke
of
york
and
him
which
god
prevent
my
lord
chancellor
is
threatened
by
people
to
be
questioned
the
next
sitting
of
the
parliament
by
some
spirits
that
do
not
love
to
see
him
so
great
but
certainly
he
is
a
good
servant
to
the
king
the
is
said
to
keep
too
great
a
court
now
and
her
being
married
to
my
lord
alban
is
commonly
talked
of
and
that
they
had
a
daughter
between
them
in
france
how
true
god
knows
the
bishops
are
high
and
go
on
without
any
diffidence
in
pressing
uniformity
and
the
presbyters
seem
silent
in
it
and
either
conform
or
lay
down
though
without
doubt
they
expect
a
turn
and
would
be
glad
these
endeavours
of
the
other
fanatiques
would
take
effect
there
having
been
a
plot
lately
found
for
which
four
have
been
publickly
tried
at
the
old
bayley
and
hanged
my
lord
sandwich
is
still
in
good
esteem
and
now
keeping
his
christmas
in
the
country
and
i
in
good
esteem
i
think
as
any
man
can
be
with
him
in
fine
for
the
good
condition
of
myself
wife
family
and
estate
in
the
great
degree
that
it
is
and
for
the
public
state
of
the
nation
so
quiet
as
it
is
the
lord
god
be
praised
january
among
other
discourse
sarah
tells
us
how
the
king
sups
at
least
four
times
every
week
with
my
lady
castlemaine
and
most
often
stays
till
the
morning
with
her
and
goes
home
through
the
garden
all
alone
privately
and
that
so
as
the
very
centrys
take
notice
of
it
and
speak
of
it
she
tells
me
that
about
a
month
ago
she
quickened
at
my
lord
charles
lord
gerard
of
brandon
gentleman
of
the
bedchamber
to
charles
ii
and
captain
of
his
guards
created
earl
of
macclesfield
and
died
about
his
wife
mentioned
afterwards
was
a
french
lady
whose
name
has
not
been
preserved
at
dinner
and
cried
out
that
she
was
undone
and
all
the
lords
and
men
were
fain
to
quit
the
room
and
women
called
to
help
her
to
the
duke
who
himself
told
me
that
sir
lawson
was
come
home
to
portsmouth
from
the
streights
with
great
renowne
among
all
men
and
i
perceive
mightily
esteemed
at
court
by
all
the
duke
did
not
stay
long
in
his
chamber
but
to
the
king
chamber
whither
by
and
by
the
russia
embassadors
come
who
it
seems
have
a
custom
that
they
will
not
come
to
have
any
treaty
with
our
or
any
king
commissioners
but
they
will
themselves
see
at
the
time
the
face
of
the
king
himself
be
it
forty
days
one
after
another
and
so
they
did
only
go
in
and
see
the
king
and
so
out
again
to
the
to
the
duke
closet
where
sir
carteret
sir
minnes
sir
batten
coventry
and
myself
attended
him
about
the
business
of
the
navy
and
after
much
discourse
and
pleasant
talk
he
went
away
to
the
cockpitt
where
we
saw
claracilla
a
comedy
by
thomas
killigrew
a
poor
play
done
by
the
house
but
neither
the
king
nor
queene
were
there
but
only
the
duke
and
duchesse
elborough
my
old
at
paul
do
tell
me
and
so
do
others
that
calamy
is
this
day
sent
to
newgate
for
preaching
sunday
was
without
leave
though
he
did
it
only
to
supply
the
place
otherwise
the
people
must
have
gone
away
without
ever
a
sermon
they
being
disappointed
of
a
minister
but
the
bishop
of
london
will
not
take
that
as
an
excuse
dined
at
home
and
there
being
the
famous
new
play
acted
the
first
time
which
is
called
the
adventures
of
five
hours
at
the
duke
house
being
they
say
made
or
translated
by
colonel
tuke
sir
george
tuke
of
crossing
temple
in
essex
evelyn
cousin
the
play
was
taken
from
the
original
of
the
spanish
poet
calderon
i
did
long
to
see
it
and
so
we
went
and
though
early
were
forced
to
sit
almost
out
of
sight
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
lower
formes
so
full
was
the
house
and
the
play
in
one
word
is
the
best
for
the
variety
and
the
most
excellent
continuance
of
the
plot
to
the
very
end
that
ever
i
saw
or
think
ever
shall
i
found
my
lord
within
and
he
and
i
went
out
through
the
garden
towards
the
duke
chamber
to
sit
upon
the
tangier
matters
but
a
lady
called
to
my
lord
out
of
my
lady
castlemaine
lodgings
telling
him
that
the
king
was
there
and
would
speak
with
him
my
lord
could
not
tell
me
what
to
say
at
the
committee
to
excuse
his
absence
but
that
he
was
with
the
king
nor
would
suffer
me
to
go
into
the
privy
garden
which
is
now
a
and
common
but
bid
me
to
go
through
some
other
way
which
i
did
so
that
i
see
that
he
is
a
servant
of
the
king
pleasures
too
as
well
as
business
singled
out
coventry
into
the
matted
gallery
and
there
i
told
him
the
complaints
i
meet
every
day
about
our
treasurer
or
his
people
paying
no
money
but
at
the
goldsmith
shops
where
they
are
forced
to
pay
fifteen
or
twenty
sometimes
per
cent
for
their
money
which
is
a
most
horrid
shame
and
that
which
must
not
be
suffered
nor
is
it
likely
that
the
treasurer
at
least
his
people
will
suffer
maynell
the
goldsmith
to
go
away
with
per
annum
as
he
do
now
get
by
making
people
pay
after
this
manner
for
their
money
to
my
lord
chancellor
where
the
king
was
to
meet
my
lord
treasurer
and
many
great
men
to
settle
the
revenue
of
tangier
i
staid
talking
awhile
there
but
the
king
not
coming
i
walked
to
my
brother
this
day
by
clarke
i
was
told
the
occasion
of
my
lord
chesterfield
going
and
taking
his
lady
my
lord
ormond
daughter
from
court
it
seems
he
not
only
hath
been
long
jealous
of
the
duke
of
york
but
did
find
them
two
talking
together
though
there
were
others
in
the
room
and
the
lady
by
all
opinions
a
most
good
virtuous
woman
he
the
next
day
of
which
the
duke
was
warned
by
somebody
that
saw
the
passion
my
lord
chesterfield
was
in
the
night
before
went
and
told
the
duke
how
much
he
did
apprehend
himself
wronged
in
his
picking
out
his
lady
of
the
whole
court
to
be
the
subject
of
his
dishonor
which
the
duke
did
answer
with
great
calmnesse
not
seeming
to
understand
the
reason
of
complaint
and
that
was
all
that
passed
but
my
lord
did
presently
pack
his
lady
into
the
country
in
derbyshire
near
the
peake
which
is
become
a
proverb
at
court
to
send
a
man
wife
to
the
peake
when
she
vexes
him
grant
and
i
to
a
where
sir
cutler
was
citizen
and
grocer
stigmatized
by
pope
for
his
avarice
and
he
did
fully
make
out
that
the
trade
of
england
is
as
great
as
ever
it
was
only
in
more
hands
and
that
of
all
trades
there
is
a
greater
number
than
ever
there
was
by
reason
of
taking
more
his
discourse
was
well
worth
hearing
i
bought
audley
way
to
be
rich
a
serious
pamphlett
and
some
good
things
worth
my
minding
i
understand
the
king
of
france
is
upon
consulting
his
divines
upon
the
old
question
what
the
power
of
the
pope
is
and
do
intend
to
make
war
against
him
unless
he
do
right
him
for
the
wrong
his
embassador
received
and
banish
the
cardinall
imperiall
by
which
i
understand
is
not
meant
the
cardinall
belonging
or
chosen
by
the
emperor
but
the
name
of
his
family
is
imperiali
to
my
lord
and
i
staid
talking
with
him
an
hour
alone
in
his
chamber
about
sundry
publick
and
private
matters
among
others
he
wonders
what
the
project
should
be
of
the
going
down
to
portsmouth
again
now
with
his
lady
at
this
time
of
the
year
it
being
no
way
we
think
to
increase
his
popularity
which
is
not
great
nor
yet
safe
to
do
it
for
that
reason
if
it
would
have
any
such
effect
captn
ferrers
tells
me
of
my
lady
caslemaine
and
sir
charles
barkeley
being
the
great
favourites
at
court
and
growing
every
day
more
and
more
so
and
that
upon
a
late
dispute
between
my
lord
chesterfield
that
is
the
lord
chamberlain
and
edward
montagu
her
master
of
the
horse
who
should
have
the
precedence
in
taking
the
queene
upperhand
abroad
out
of
the
house
which
montagu
challenges
it
was
given
to
my
lord
chesterfield
so
that
i
perceive
he
goes
down
the
wind
in
honor
as
well
as
every
thing
else
every
day
i
met
with
monsieur
raby
who
is
lately
come
from
france
i
had
a
great
deal
of
very
good
discourse
with
him
concerning
the
difference
between
the
french
and
the
pope
and
the
occasion
which
he
told
me
very
particularly
and
to
my
great
content
and
of
most
of
the
chief
affairs
of
france
which
i
did
enquire
and
that
the
king
is
a
most
excellent
prince
doing
all
business
himself
and
that
it
is
true
he
hath
a
mistresse
mademoiselle
la
valiere
one
of
the
princess
henriette
women
that
he
courts
for
his
pleasure
every
other
day
but
not
so
as
to
make
him
neglect
his
publick
affairs
he
tells
me
how
the
king
do
carry
himself
nobly
to
the
relations
of
the
dead
cardinall
cardinal
mazarine
and
will
not
suffer
one
pasquill
to
come
forth
against
him
and
that
he
acts
by
what
directions
he
received
from
him
before
his
death
my
manuscript
is
brought
home
handsomely
bound
to
my
full
content
and
now
i
think
i
have
a
better
collection
in
reference
to
the
navy
and
shall
have
by
the
time
i
have
filled
it
than
any
of
my
predecessors
february
this
day
creed
and
i
walking
in
white
hall
did
see
the
king
coming
privately
from
my
lady
castlemaine
which
is
a
poor
thing
for
a
prince
to
do
and
so
i
expressed
my
sense
of
it
to
creed
in
terms
which
i
should
not
have
done
but
that
i
believe
he
is
trusty
in
that
point
with
sir
minnes
and
sir
batten
to
the
duke
and
after
discourse
as
usual
with
him
in
his
closet
i
went
to
my
lord
the
king
and
the
duke
being
gone
to
chapel
it
being
a
collar
day
where
i
staid
with
him
until
towards
noon
there
being

most
celebrated
mathematician
knighted
by
charles
and
made
surveyor
of
the
ordnance
ob
talking
about
some
mathematical
businesses
with
coventry
down
to
his
chamber
where
he
did
tell
me
how
he
do
make
himself
an
interest
by
doing
business
truly
and
justly
though
he
thwarts
others
greater
than
himself
not
striving
to
make
himself
friends
by
addresses
and
by
this
he
thinks
and
observes
he
do
live
as
contentedly
now
he
finds
himself
secured
from
fear
of
want
and
take
one
time
with
another
as
void
of
fear
or
cares
or
more
than
they
that
as
his
own
termes
were
have
quicker
pleasures
and
sharper
agonies
than
he
to
paul
schoole
it
being
there
i
heard
some
of
their
speeches
and
they
were
just
as
schoolboys
used
to
be
of
the
seven
liberal
sciences
but
i
think
not
so
good
as
ours
were
in
our
time
thence
to
bow
church
to
the
court
of
arches
where
a
judge
sits
and
his
proctors
about
him
in
their
habits
and
their
pleadings
all
in
latin
here
i
was
sworn
to
give
a
true
answer
to
my
uncle
libells
and
back
again
to

excellent

and
it
being
too
soon
to
go
to

i
walked
up

down
and
looked
upon
the
outside
of
the
new
theatre

in

garden
which
will
be
very
fine
and
so
to
a
bookseller
in
the
strand
and
there
bought
hudibras
again
it
being
certainly
some
ill
humour
to
be
so
against
that
which
all
the
world
cries
up
to
be
the
example
of
wit
for
which
i
am
resolved
once
more
to

of
my
lord
windsor
being
come
home
from
jamaica
unlooked
for
which
makes
us
think
that
these
young
lords
are
not
fit
to
do
any
service
abroad
though
it
is
said
that
he
could
not
have
his
health
there
but
hath
raced
a
fort
of
the
king
of
spain
upon
cuba
which
is
considerable
or
said
to
be
so
for
his
honour
to
westminster
hall
and
there
find
great
expectation
what
the
parliament
will
do
when
they
come
two
days
hence
to
sit
again
in
matters
of
religion
the
great
question
is
whether
the
presbyters
will
be
contented
to
let
the
papists
have
the
same
liberty
of
conscience
with
them
or
no
or
rather
be
denied
it
themselves
and
the
papists
i
hear
are
very
busy
in
designing
how
to
make
the
presbyters
consent
to
take
their
liberty
and
to
let
them
have
the
same
with
them
which
some
are
apt
to
think
they
will
it
seems
a
priest
was
taken
in
his
vests
officiating
somewhere
in
holborne
the
other
day
and
was
committed
by
secretary
morris
according
to
law
and
they
say
the
bishop
of
london
did
give
him
thanks
for
it
to
my
lord
sandwich
whom
i
found
at
cards
with
pickering
but
he
made
an
end
soon
and
so
all
alone
he
told
me
he
had
a
great
secret
to
tell
me
such
as
no
flesh
knew
but
himself
nor
ought
which
was
this
that
yesterday
morning
eschar
edward
montagu
man
did
come
to
him
from
his
master
with
some
of
the
clerkes
of
the
exchequer
for
my
lord
to
sign
to
their
books
for
the
embassy
money
which
my
lord
very
civilly
desired
not
to
do
till
he
had
spoke
with
his
master
himself
in
the
afternoon
my
lord
and
my
lady
wright
being
at
cards
in
his
chamber
in
comes
montagu
and
desiring
to
speak
with
my
lord
at
the
window
in
his
chamber
he
began
to
charge
my
lord
with
the
greatest
ingratitude
in
the
world
that
he
that
had
received
his
earldom
garter
per
annum
and
whatever
he
has
in
the
world
from
him
should
now
study
him
all
the
dishonour
that
he
could
and
so
fell
to
tell
my
lord
that
if
he
should
speak
all
that
he
knew
of
him
he
could
do
so
and
so
in
a
word
he
did
rip
up
all
that
could
be
said
they
was
unworthy
and
in
the
basest
terms
they
could
be
spoken
in
to
which
my
lord
answered
with
great
temper
justifying
himself
but
endeavouring
to
lessen
his
heat
which
was
a
strange
temper
in
him
knowing
that
he
did
owe
all
he
hath
in
the
world
to
my
lord
and
that
he
is
now
all
that
he
is
by
his
means
and
favour
but
my
lord
did
forbear
to
increase
the
quarrel
knowing
that
it
would
be
to
no
good
purpose
for
the
world
to
see
a
difference
in
the
family
but
did
allay
them
so
as
that
he
fell
to
weeping
and
after
much
talk
among
other
things
montagu
telling
him
that
there
was
a
fellow
in
the
towne
naming
me
that
had
done
ill
offices
and
that
if
he
knew
it
to
be
so
he
would
have
him
cudgelled
my
lord
did
promise
him
that
if
upon
account
he
saw
that
there
was
not
many
tradesmen
unpaid
he
would
sign
the
books
but
if
there
was
he
could
not
bear
with
taking
too
great
a
debt
upon
him
so
this
day
he
sent
him
an
account
and
a
letter
assuring
him
there
was
not
above
unpaid
and
so
my
lord
did
sign
to
the
exchequer
books
upon
the
whole
i
understand
fully
what
a
rogue
he
is
and
how
my
lord
do
think
and
will
think
of
him
for
the
future
telling
me
that
thus
he
has
served
his
father
my
lord
manchester
and
his
whole
family
and
now
himself
and
which
is
worst
that
he
hath
abused
and
in
speeches
every
day
do
abuse
my
lord
chancellor
whose
favour
he
hath
lost
and
hath
no
friend
but
sir
bennet
and
that
i
knowing
the
rise
of
his
friendship
only
from
the
likeness
of
their
pleasures
and
acquaintance
and
concealments
they
have
in
the
same
matters
of
lust
and
baseness
for
which
god
forgive
them
but
he
do
flatter
himself
from
promises
of
sir
bennet
that
he
shall
have
a
pension
of
per
annum
and
be
made
an
earl
my
lord
told
me
he
expected
a
challenge
from
him
but
told
me
there
was
no
great
fear
of
him
for
there
was
no
man
lies
under
such
an
imputation
as
he
do
in
the
business
of
cholmly
who
though
a
simple
sorry
fellow
do
brave
him
and
struts
before
him
with
the
queene
to
the
sport
and
observation
of
the
whole
court
pickering
tells
me
the
story
is
very
true
of
a
child
being
dropped
at
the
ball
at
court
and
that
the
king
had
it
in
his
closet
a
week
after
and
did
dissect
it
and
making
great
sport
of
it
said
that
in
his
opinion
it
must
have
been
a
month
and
three
houres
old
and
that
whatever
others
think
he
hath
the
greatest
loss
it
being
a
boy
as
he
says
that
hath
lost
a
subject
by
the
business
he
tells
me
too
that
sir
bennet
is
a
catholique
and
how
all
the
court
almost
is
changed
to
the
worse
since
his
coming
in
they
being
affraid
of
him
and
that
the
court
is
now
the
greatest
of
all
and
that
our
own
queene
hath
little
or
no
company
come
to
her
which
i
know
also
to
be
very
true
and
am
sorry
to
see
it
hater
and
i
alone
at
the
office
finishing
our
account
of
the
extra
charge
of
the
navy
not
properly
belonging
to
the
navy
since
the
king
coming
in
to
christmas
last
and
all
extra
things
being
abated
i
find
that
the
true
charge
of
the
navy
to
that
time
hath
been
after
the
rate
of
a
year
i
made
an
end
by
eleven
at
night
this
day
the
parliament
met
again
after
their
long
prorogation
but
i
know
not
any
thing
what
they
have
done
being
within
doors
all
day
this
day
i
read
the
king
speech
to
the
parliament
yesterday
which
is
very
short
and
not
very
obliging
but
only
telling
them
his
desire
to
have
a
power
of
indulging
tender
consciences
and
that
he
will
yield
to
have
any
mixture
in
the
uniformity
of
the
church
discipline
and
says
the
same
for
the
papists
but
declares
against
their
ever
being
admitted
to
have
any
offices
or
places
of
trust
in
the
kingdom
but
god
knows
too
many
have
to
the
office
where
sir
minnes
most
of
the
rest
being
at
the
all
the
morning
answering
petitions
and
other
business
towards
noon
there
comes
a
man
as
if
upon
ordinary
business
and
shows
me
a
writ
from
the
exchequer
called
a
commission
of
rebellion
and
tells
me
that
i
am
his
prisoner
in
field
business
which
methought
did
strike
me
to
the
heart
to
think
that
we
could
not
sit
in
the
middle
of
the
king
business
i
told
him
how
and
where
we
were
employed
and
bid
him
have
a
care
and
perceiving
that
we
were
busy
he
said
he
would
and
did
withdraw
for
an
houre
in
which
time
sir
minnes
took
coach
and
to
court
to
see
what
he
could
do
from
thence
and
our
solicitor
against
field
come
by
chance
and
told
me
that
he
would
go
and
satisfy
the
fees
of
the
court
and
would
end
the
business
so
he
went
away
about
that
and
i
staid
in
my
closet
till
by
and
by
the
man
and
four
more
of
his
fellows
come
to
know
what
i
would
do
and
i
told
them
to
stay
till
i
heard
from
the
king
or
my
lord
chief
baron
to
both
whom
i
had
now
sent
with
that
they
consulted
and
told
me
that
if
i
would
promise
to
stay
in
the
house
they
would
go
and
refresh
themselves
and
come
again
and
know
what
answer
i
had
so
they
away
and
i
home
to
dinner
before
i
had
dined
the
bayleys
come
back
again
with
the
constable
and
at
the
office
knock
for
me
but
found
me
not
there
and
i
hearing
in
what
manner
they
were
come
did
forbear
letting
them
know
where
i
was
so
they
stood
knocking
and
enquiring
for
me
by
and
by
at
my
comes
sir
batten
mungo
to
tell
me
that
his
master
and
lady
would
have
me
come
to
their
house
through
sir
minnes
lodgings
which
i
could
not
do
but
however
by
ladders
did
get
over
the
pale
between
our
yards
and
their
house
where
i
found
them
as
they
have
reason
to
be
much
concerned
for
me
my
lady
especially
the
fellows
staid
in
the
yard
swearing
with
one
or
two
constables
and
some
time
we
locked
them
into
the
yard
and
by
and
by
let
them
out
again
and
so
kept
them
all
the
afternoon
not
letting
them
see
me
or
know
where
i
was
one
time
i
went
up
to
the
top
of
sir
batten
house
and
out
of
one
of
their
windows
spoke
to
my
wife
out
of
one
of
ours
which
methought
though
i
did
it
in
mirth
yet
i
was
sad
to
think
what
a
sad
thing
it
would
be
for
me
to
be
really
in
that
condition
by
and
by
comes
sir
minnes
who
like
himself
and
all
that
he
do
tells
us
that
he
can
do
no
good
but
that
my
lord
chancellor
wonders
that
we
did
not
cause
the
seamen
to
fall
about
their
eares
which
we
wished
we
could
have
done
without
our
being
seen
in
it
and
captain
grove
being
there
he
did
give
them
some
affront
and
would
have
got
some
seamen
to
have
drubbed
them
but
he
had
not
time
nor
did
we
think
it
fit
to
have
done
it
they
having
executed
their
commission
but
there
was
occasion
given
that
he
did
draw
upon
one
of
them
who
did
complain
that
grove
had
pricked
him
in
the
breast
but
no
hurt
done
but
i
see
that
grove
would
have
done
our
business
to
them
if
we
had
bid
him
by
and
by
comes
clerke
our
sollicitor
who
brings
us
a
release
from
our
adverse
atturney
we
paying
the
fees
of
the
commission
which
comes
to
five
markes
and
the
charges
of
these
fellows
which
are
called
the
commissioners
but
are
the
most
rogues
that
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
so
he
showed
them
this
release
and
they
seemed
satisfied
and
went
away
with
him
to
their
atturney
to
be
paid
by
him
but
before
they
went
sir
batten
and
my
lady
did
begin
to
taunt
them
but
the
rogues
answered
them
as
high
as
themselves
and
swore
they
would
come
again
and
called
me
rogue
and
rebel
and
they
would
bring
the
sheriffe
and
untile
his
house
before
he
should
harbour
a
rebel
in
his
house
and
that
they
would
be
here
again
shortly
well
at
last
they
went
away
and
i
by
advice
took
occasion
to
go
abroad
and
walked
through
the
street
to
show
myself
among
the
neighbours
that
they
might
not
think
worse
than
the
business
is
i
home
to
sir
batten
again
where
sir
lawson
captain
allen
spragge
afterwards
sir
edward
spragg
a
distinguished
naval
commander
who
perished
in
a
boat
which
was
sunk
during
an
action
with
van
tromp
in
whilst
he
was
preparing
to
hoist
his
flag
on
board
a
third
ship
having
previously
lost
two
in
the
engagement
and
several
others
and
all
our
discourse
about
the
disgrace
done
to
our
office
to
be
liable
to
this
trouble
which
we
must
get
removed
hither
comes
clerke
by
and
by
and
tells
me
that
he
hath
paid
the
fees
of
the
court
for
the
commission
but
the
men
are
not
contented
with
under
for
their
charges
which
he
will
not
give
them
and
therefore
advises
me
not
to
stir
abroad
till
monday
that
he
comes
or
sends
to
me
again
whereby
i
shall
not
be
able
to
go
to
white
hall
to
the
duke
of
york
as
i
ought
here
i
staid
vexing
and
yet
pleased
to
see
every
body
for
me
and
so
home
where
my
people
are
mightily
surprised
to
see
this
business
but
it
troubles
me
not
very
much
it
being
nothing
touching
my
particular
person
or
estate
sir
batten
tells
me
that
little
is
done
yet
in
the
but
only
this
day
it
was
moved
and
ordered
that
all
the
members
of
the
house
do
subscribe
to
the
renouncing
of
the
covenant
which
it
is
thought
will
try
some
of
them
there
is
also
a
bill
brought
in
for
the
wearing
of
nothing
but
cloth
or
stuffs
of
our
own
manufacture
and
is
likely
to
be
passed
among
other
talk
this
morning
my
lady
did
speak
concerning
commissioner
pett
calling
the
present
king
bastard
and
other
high
words
heretofore
and
sir
batten
did
tell
us
that
he
did
give
the
duke
and
coventry
an
account
of
that
and
other
like
matters
in
writing
under
oath
of
which
i
was
ashamed
and
for
which
i
was
sorry
went
not
out
all
the
morning
but
after
dinner
to
sir
batten
and
sir
pen
where
discoursing
much
of
yesterday
trouble
and
scandal
but
that
which
troubled
me
most
was
sir
minnes
coming
from
court
at
night
and
instead
of
bringing
great
comfort
from
thence
but
i
expected
no
better
from
him
he
tells
me
that
the
duke
and
coventry
make
no
great
matter
of
it
up
by
times
and
not
daring
to
go
by
land
did
griffin
going
along
with
me
for
fear
slip
to
white
hall
by
water
where
to
coventry
and
as
we
used
to
do
to
the
duke
the
other
of
my
fellows
being
come
but
we
did
nothing
of
our
business
the
duke
being
sent
for
to
the
king
that
he
could
not
stay
to
speak
with
us
this
morning
come
my
lord
windsor
created
earl
of
plymouth
december
to
kiss
the
duke
hand
being
returned
from
jamaica
he
tells
the
duke
that
from
such
a
degree
of
latitude
going
thither
he
began
to
be
sick
and
was
never
well
till
his
coming
so
far
back
again
and
then
presently
begun
to
be
well
he
told
the
duke
of
their
taking
the
fort
of
jago
upon
cuba
with
his
men
but
upon
the
whole
i
believe
that
he
did
matters
like
a
young
lord
and
was
weary
of
being
upon
service
out
of
his
own
country
where
he
might
have
pleasure
for
methought
it
was
a
shame
to
see
him
this
very
afternoon
being
the
first
day
of
his
coming
to
town
to
be
at
a
playhouse
to
my
lord
sandwich
it
was
a
great
trouble
to
me
and
i
had
great
apprehensions
of
it
that
my
lord
desired
me
to
go
to
westminster
hall
to
the
door
about
business
and
to
sir
wm
wheeler
for
queensborough
which
i
told
him
i
would
but
durst
not
go
for
fear
of
being
taken
by
these
rogues
but
was
forced
to
go
to
white
hall
and
take
boat
and
so
land
below
the
tower
at
the
and
so
the
back
way
over
little
tower
hill
and
with
my
cloak
over
my
face
took
one
of
the
watermen
along
with
me
and
staid
behind
our
while
he
went
to
see
whether
any
body
stood
within
the
gate
but
there
was
nobody
and
so
i
got
safe
into
the
garden
and
coming
to
open
my
office
door
something
behind
it
fell
in
the
opening
which
made
me
start
so
that
god
knows
in
what
a
sad
condition
i
should
be
if
i
were
truly
in
debt
and
therefore
ought
to
bless
god
that
i
have
no
such
real
reason
and
to
endeavour
to
keep
myself
by
my
good
deportment
and
good
husbandry
out
of
any
such
condition
at
home
i
find
by
a
note
that
clerke
in
my
absence
hath
left
here
that
i
am
free
and
that
he
hath
stopped
all
matters
in
court
and
i
was
very
glad
of
it
we
took
coach
and
to
court
and
there
saw
the
wilde
gallant
a
comedy
by
dryden
performed
by
the
king
house
but
it
was
ill
acted
the
king
did
not
seem
pleased
at
all
the
whole
play
nor
any
body
else
my
lady
castlemaine
was
all
worth
seeing
and
little
steward
frances
daughter
of
walter
stewart
son
of
lord
blantyre
married
charles
fifth
duke
of
richmond
and
died
wells
do
appear
at
court
again
and
looks
well
so
that
it
may
be
the
late
report
of
laying
the
dropped
child
to
her
was
not
true
this
day
i
was
told
that
my
lady
castlemaine
hath
all
the
king
christmas
presents
made
him
by
the
peers
given
to
her
which
is
a
most
abominable
thing
and
that
at
the
great
ball
she
was
much
richer
in
jewells
than
the
queene
and
duchesse
put
both
together
among
other
things
my
lord
sandwich
tells
me
that
he
hears
the
commons
will
not
agree
to
the
king
late
declaration
nor
will
yield
that
the
papists
have
any
ground
given
them
to
raise
themselves
up
again
in
england
which
i
perceive
by
my
lord
was
expected
at
court
the
commons
in
parliament
i
hear
are
very
high
to
stand
to
the
act
of
uniformity
and
will
not
indulge
the
papists
which
is
endeavoured
by
the
court
party
nor
the
presbyters
sir
batten
and
i
by
water
to
the
he
went
in
and
i
walked
up
and
down
the
hall
all
the
newes
is
the
great
oddes
yesterday
in
the
votes
between
them
that
are
for
the
indulgence
to
the
papists
and
presbyters
and
those
that
are
against
it
which
did
carry
it
by
against
and
pretty
it
is
to
consider
how
the
king
would
appear
to
be
a
stiff
protestant
and
son
of
the
church
and
yet
willing
to
give
a
liberty
to
these
people
because
of
his
promise
at
breda
and
yet
all
the
world
do
believe
that
the
king
would
not
have
the
liberty
given
them
at
all
about
commissioner
pett
and
i
walked
to
chyrurgeon
hall
we
being
all
invited
thither
and
promised
to
dine
there
where
we
were
led
into
the
theatre
and
by
and
by
comes
the
reader
tearne
christopher
terne
of
leyden
originally
of
cambridge
and
fellow
of
the
college
of
physicians
ob
with
the
master
and
company
in
a
very
handsome
manner
and
all
being
settled
he
begun
his
lecture
and
his
discourse
being
ended
we
had
a
fine
dinner
and
good
learned
company
many
doctors
of
phisique
and
we
used
with
extraordinary
great
respect
among
other
observables
we
drunk
the
king
health
out
of
a
gilt
cup
given
by
king
henry
viii
to
this
company
with
bells
hanging
at
it
which
every
man
is
to
ring
by
shaking
after
he
hath
drunk
up
the
whole
cup
there
is
also
a
very
excellent
piece
of
the
king
done
by
holbein
stands
up
in
the
hall
with
the
officers
of
the
company
kneeling
to
him
to
receive
their
charter
scarborough
took
some
of
his
friends
and
i
went
with
them
to
see
the
body
of
a
lusty
fellow
a
seaman
that
was
hanged
for
a
robbery
it
seems
one
dillon
of
a
great
family
was
after
much
endeavours
to
have
saved
him
hanged
with
a
silken
halter
this
sessions
of
his
own
preparing
not
for
honour
only
but
it
being
soft
and
sleek
it
do
slip
close
and
kills
that
is
strangles
presently
whereas
a
stiff
one
do
not
come
so
close
together
and
so
the
party
may
live
the
longer
before
killed
but
all
the
doctors
at
table
conclude
that
there
is
no
pain
at
all
in
hanging
for
that
it
do
stop
the
circulation
of
the
blood
and
so
stops
all
sense
and
motion
in
an
instant
to
sir
batten
to
speak
upon
some
business
where
i
found
sir
minnes
pretty
well
fuddled
i
thought
he
took
me
aside
to
tell
me
how
being
at
my
lord
chancellor
my
lord
told
him
that
there
was
a
great
seal
passing
for
sir
pen
through
the
impossibility
of
the
comptroller
duty
to
be
performed
by
one
man
to
be
as
it
were
with
him
at
which
he
is
stark
mad
and
swears
he
will
give
up
his
place
for
my
part
i
do
hope
when
all
is
done
that
my
following
my
business
will
keep
me
secure
against
all
their
envys
but
to
see
how
the
old
man
do
strut
and
swear
that
he
understands
all
his
duty
as
easily
as
crack
a
nut
and
easier
he
told
my
lord
chancellor
for
his
teeth
are
gone
and
that
he
understands
it
as
well
as
any
man
in
england
and
that
he
will
never
leave
to
record
that
he
should
be
said
to
be
unable
to
do
his
duty
alone
though
god
knows
he
can
not
do
it
more
than
a
child
the
house
have
this
noon
been
with
the
king
to
give
him
their
reasons
for
refusing
to
grant
any
indulgence
to
presbyters
or
papists
which
he
with
great
content
and
seeming
pleasure
took
saying
that
he
doubted
not
but
he
and
they
should
agree
in
all
things
though
there
may
seem
a
difference
in
judgements
he
having
writ
and
declared
for
an
indulgence
and
that
he
did
believe
never
prince
was
happier
in
a
house
of
commons
than
he
was
in
them
at
the
privy
seale
i
did
see
the
docquet
by
which
sir
pen
is
made
the
comptroller
assistant
as
sir
minnes
told
me
last
night
march
this
afternoon
roger
pepys
tells
me
that
for
certain
the
king
is
for
all
this
very
highly
incensed
at
the
parliament
late
opposing
the
indulgence
which
i
am
sorry
for
and
fear
it
will
breed
great
discontent
to
the
lobby
and
spoke
with
my
cousin
roger
who
is
going
to
cambridge
in
the
hall
i
do
hear
that
the
catholiques
are
in
great
hopes
for
all
this
and
do
set
hard
upon
the
king
to
get
indulgence
matters
i
hear
are
all
naught
in
ireland
and
the
people
that
is
the
papists
do
cry
out
against
the
commissioners
sent
by
the
king
so
that
they
say
the
english
interest
will
be
lost
there
this
day
it
seems
the
house
of
commons
have
been
very
high
against
the
papists
being
incensed
by
the
stir
which
they
make
for
their
having
an
indulgence
which
without
doubt
is
a
great
folly
in
them
to
be
so
hot
upon
at
this
time
when
they
see
how
averse
already
the
house
have
showed
themselves
from
it
this
evening
povy
tells
me
that
my
lord
sandwich
is
this
day
so
ill
that
he
is
much
afraid
of
him
which
puts
me
to
great
pain
not
more
for
my
own
sake
than
for
his
poor
family
creed
told
me
how
for
some
words
of
my
lady
gerard
against
my
lady
castlemaine
to
the
queene
the
king
did
the
other
day
apprehend
her
in
going
out
to
dance
with
her
at
a
ball
when
she
desired
it
as
the
ladies
do
and
is
since
forbid
attending
the
queene
by
the
king
which
is
much
talked
of
my
lord
her
husband
being
a
great
favourite
lord
day
to
white
hall
i
heard
king
bishop
of
chichester
make
a
good
and
eloquent
sermon
upon
these
words
they
that
sow
in
tears
shall
reap
in
joy
whence
the
chapel
in
lent
being
hung
with
black
and
no
anthem
after
sermon
as
at
other
times
to
my
lord
sandwich
at
sir
wheeler
i
found
him
out
of
order
thinking
himself
to
be
in
a
fit
of
ague
after
dinner
up
to
my
lord
there
being
rumball
my
lord
among
other
discourse
did
tell
me
of
his
great
difficultys
passed
in
the
business
of
the
sound
and
of
his
receiving
letters
from
the
king
there
but
his
sending
them
by
whetstone
was
a
great
folly
and
the
story
how
my
lord
being
at
dinner
with
sydney
the
famous
algernon
sydney
one
of
the
ambassadors
sent
to
sweden
and
denmark
by
richard
cromwell
one
of
his
fellow
plenipotentiarys
and
his
mortal
enemy
did
see
whetstone
and
put
off
his
hat
three
times
to
him
and
the
fellow
would
not
be
known
which
my
lord
imputed
to
his
coxcombly
humour
of
which
he
was
full
and
bid
sydney
take
notice
of
him
too
when
at
the
very
time
he
had
letters
these
letters
are
in
thurloe
state
papers
vol
vii
one
was
from
the
king
the
other
from
chancellor
hyde
in
his
pocket
from
the
king
as
it
proved
afterwards
and
sydney
afterwards
did
find
it
out
at
copenhagen
the
dutch
commissioners
telling
him
how
my
lord
sandwich
had
desired
one
of
their
ships
to
carry
back
whetstone
to
lubeck
he
being
come
from
flanders
from
the
king
but
i
can
not
but
remember
my
lord
equanimity
in
all
these
affairs
with
admiration
about
noon
sir
robinson
lord
mayor
desiring
way
through
the
garden
from
the
tower
called
in
at
the
office
and
there
invited
me
and
sir
pen
who
happened
to
be
in
the
way
to
dinner
and
we
did
go
and
there
had
a
great
lent
dinner
of
fish
little
flesh
there
dined
with
us
slingsby
of
the
mint
master
of
the
mint
frequently
mentioned
by
evelyn
who
showed
us
all
the
new
pieces
both
gold
and
silver
examples
of
them
all
that
were
made
for
the
king
by
blondeau
way
and
compared
them
with
those
made
for
oliver
the
pictures
of
the
latter
made
by
symons
thomas
simon
an
engraver
of
coins
and
medals
and
of
the
king
by
one
rotyr
there
were
three
brothers
named
rotier
all
medallists
philip
intoduced
the
likeness
of
stewart
in
the
figure
of
britannia
a
german
i
think
that
dined
with
us
also
he
extolls
those
of
rotyr
above
the
others
and
indeed
i
think
they
are
the
better
because
the
sweeter
of
the
two
but
upon
my
word
those
of
the
protector
are
more
like
in
my
mind
than
the
king
but
both
very
well
worth
seeing
the
crownes
of
cromwell
are
now
sold
it
seems
for
and
to
the
duke
where
we
met
of
course
and
talked
of
our
navy
matters
then
to
the
commission
of
tangier
and
there
had
my
lord
peterborough
commission
read
over
and
secretary
bennet
did
make
his
querys
upon
it
in
order
to
the
drawing
one
for
my
lord
rutherford
more
regularly
that
being
a
very
extravagant
thing
here
long
discoursing
upon
my
lord
rutherford
despatch
and
so
broke
up
coventry
and
i
discoursed
how
the
treasurer
doth
intend
to
come
to
pay
in
course
which
is
the
thing
of
the
world
that
will
do
the
king
the
greatest
service
in
the
navy
and
which
joys
my
heart
to
hear
of
he
tells
me
of
the
business
of
sir
minnes
and
sir
pen
which
he
said
was
chiefly
to
make
pett
being
joyned
with
sir
batten
to
go
down
the
better
and
how
he
well
sees
that
neither
one
nor
the
other
can
do
their
duties
without
help
to
margaret
hill
in
southwark
where
the
judge
of
the
admiralty
come
and
the
rest
of
the
doctors
of
the
civill
law
and
some
other
commissioners
whose
commission
of
oyer
and
terminer
was
read
and
then
the
charge
given
by
exton
sir
thomas
exton
dean
of
the
arches
and
judge
of
the
admiralty
court
which
methought
was
somewhat
dull
though
he
would
seem
to
intend
it
to
be
very
rhetoricall
saying
that
justice
had
two
wings
one
of
which
spread
itself
over
the
land
and
the
other
over
the
water
which
was
this
admiralty
court
i
perceive
that
this
court
is
yet
but
in
its
infancy
as
to
its
rising
again
and
their
design
and
consultation
was
i
could
overhear
them
how
to
proceed
with
the
most
solemnity
and
spend
time
there
being
only
two
businesses
to
do
which
of
themselves
could
not
spend
much
time
sir
batten
and
i
to
my
lord
mayor
where
we
found
my
lord
with
colonel
strangways
giles
strangways
for
dorsetshire
and
sir
richard
floyd
probably
sir
richard
for
radnorshire
in
the
cellar
drinking
were
we
sat
with
them
and
then
up
and
by
and
by
come
in
sir
richard
ford
we
had
many
discourses
but
from
all
of
them
i
do
find
sir
ford
a
very
able
man
of
his
brains
and
tongue
and
a
scholler
but
my
lord
mayor
a
talking
bragging
buffleheaded
fellow
that
would
be
thought
to
have
led
all
the
city
in
the
great
business
of
bringing
in
the
king
and
that
nobody
understood
his
plot
and
the
dark
lanthorn
he
walked
by
but
led
them
and
plowed
with
them
as
oxen
and
asses
his
own
words
to
do
what
he
had
a
mind
when
in
every
discourse
i
observe
him
to
be
as
very
a
coxcombe
as
i
could
have
thought
had
been
in
the
city
but
he
is
resolved
to
do
great
matters
in
pulling
down
the
shops
quite
through
the
city
as
he
hath
done
in
many
places
and
will
make
a
thorough
passage
quite
through
the
city
through
which
indeed
will
be
very
fine
and
then
his
precept
which
he
in
said
he
had
drawn
up
himself
and
hath
printed
it
against
coachmen
and
carmen
affronting
of
the
gentry
in
the
street
it
is
drawn
so
like
a
fool
and
some
faults
were
openly
found
in
it
that
i
believe
he
will
have
so
much
wit
as
not
to
proceed
upon
it
though
it
be
printed
here
we
staid
talking
till
eleven
at
night
sir
ford
breaking
to
my
lord
our
business
of
our
patent
to
be
justices
of
the
peace
in
the
city
which
he
stuck
at
mightily
but
however
sir
ford
knows
him
to
be
a
fool
and
so
in
his
discourse
he
made
him
appear
and
cajoled
him
into
a
consent
to
it
but
so
as
i
believe
when
he
comes
to
his
right
mind
he
will
be
of
another
opinion
and
though
sir
ford
moved
it
very
weightily
and
neatly
yet
i
had
rather
it
had
been
spared
now
but
to
see
how
he
rants
and
pretends
to
sway
all
the
city
in
the
court
of
aldermen
and
says
plainly
that
they
can
not
do
nor
will
he
suffer
them
to
do
any
thing
but
what
he
pleases
nor
is
there
any
officer
of
the
city
but
of
his
putting
in
nor
any
man
that
could
have
kept
the
city
for
the
king
thus
well
and
long
but
him
and
if
the
country
can
be
preserved
he
will
undertake
that
the
city
shall
not
dare
to
stir
again
when
i
am
confident
there
is
no
man
almost
in
the
city
cares
for
him
nor
hath
he
brains
to
outwit
any
ordinary
tradesman
meeting
with
kirton
kinsman
in
paul
church
yard
he
and
i
to
a
where
i
hear
how
there
had
like
to
have
been
a
surprizall
of
dublin
by
some
discontented
protestants
and
other
things
of
like
nature
and
it
seems
the
commissioners
have
carried
themselves
so
high
for
the
papists
that
the
others
will
not
endure
it
hewlett
and
some
others
are
taken
and
clapped
up
and
they
say
the
king
hath
sent
over
to
dissolve
the
parliament
there
who
went
very
high
against
the
commissioners
pray
god
send
all
well
by
appointment
our
full
board
met
and
sir
philip
warwick
and
sir
robert
long
come
from
my
lord
treasurer
to
speak
with
us
about
the
state
of
the
debts
of
the
navy
and
how
to
settle
it
so
as
to
begin
upon
the
new
foundation
of
per
annum
which
the
king
is
now
resolved
not
to
exceed
lord
day
wrote
out
our
bill
for
the
parliament
about
our
being
made
justices
of
peace
in
the
city
so
to
church
where
a
dull
formall
fellow
that
prayed
for
the
right

john
lord
barkeley
lord
president
of
connaught
to
my
lord
sandwich
and
with
him
talking
a
good
while
i
find
the
court
would
have
this
indulgence
go
on
but
the
parliament
are
against
it
matters
in
ireland
are
full
of
discontent
after
dinner
in
comes
moore
and
sat
and
talked
with
us
a
good
while
among
other
things
telling
me
that
neither
my
lord
nor
he
are
under
apprehensions
of
the
late
discourse
in
the
house
of
commons
concerning
resumption
of
crowne
lands
april
i
went
to
the
temple
to
my
cozen
roger
pepys
to
see
and
talk
with
him
a
little
who
tells
me
that
with
much
ado
the
parliament
do
agree
to
throw
down
popery
but
he
says
it
is
with
so
much
spite
and
passion
and
an
endeavour
of
bringing
all
into
the
same
condition
that
he
is
afraid
matters
will
not
yet
go
so
well
as
he
could
wish
sir
pen
told
me
that
this
day
the
king
hath
sent
to
the
house
his
concurrence
wholly
with
them
against
the
popish
priests
jesuits
which
gives
great
content
and
i
am
glad
of
it
to
the
tangier
committee
where
we
find
ourselves
at
a
great
stand
the
establishment
being
but
per
annum
and
the
forces
to
be
kept
in
the
town
at
the
least
estimate
that
my
lord
rutherford
can
be
got
to
bring
is
the
charge
of
this
year
work
of
the
mole
will
be
besides
to
my
lord
peterborough
as
a
pension
and
the
fortifications
and
contingencys
which
puts
us
to
a
great
stand
i
find
at
court
that
there
is
some
bad
news
from
ireland
of
an
insurrection
of
the
catholiques
there
which
puts
them
into
an
alarme
i
hear
also
in
the
city
that
for
certain
there
is
an
embargo
upon
all
our
ships
in
spayne
upon
this
action
of
my
lord
windsor
at
cuba
which
signifies
little
or
nothing
but
only
he
hath
a
mind
to
say
that
he
hath
done
something
before
he
comes
back
again
after
dinner
to
hide
parke
at
the
parke
was
the
king
and
in
another
coach
my
lady
castlemaine
they
greeting
one
another
at
every
turn
by
water
to
white
hall
to
chapel
where
preached
pierce
the
famous
man
that
preached
the
sermon
so
much
cried
up
before
the
king
against
the
papists
his
matter
was
the
devil
tempting
our
saviour
being
carried
into
the
wilderness
by
the
spirit
and
he
hath
as
much
of
natural
eloquence
as
most
men
that
ever
i
heard
in
my
life
mixed
with
so
much
learning
after
sermon
i
went
up
and
saw
the
ceremony
of
the
bishop
of
peterborough
paying
homage
upon
the
knee
to
the
king
while
sir
bennet
secretary
read
the
king
grant
of
the
bishopric
of
lincolne
to
which
he
is
translated
his
name
is
lany
benjamin
lany
made
bishop
of
peterborough
translated
to
lincoln
and
to
ely
here
i
also
saw
the
duke
of
monmouth
with
his
order
of
the
garter
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
it
i
hear
that
the
university
of
cambridge
did
treat
him
a
little
while
since
with
all
the
honour
possible
with
a
comedy
at
trinity
college
and
banquet
and
made
him
master
of
arts
there
all
which
they
say
the
king
took
very
well
raynbow
master
of
magdalene
being
now
edward
rainbow
chaplain
to
the
king
and
dean
of
peterborough
and
in
bishop
of
carlisle
ob
lord
day
coming
home
a
drunken
boy
was
carrying
by
our
constable
to
our
new
pair
of
stocks
to
handsel
them
sir
carteret
tells
me
that
he
perceives
the
parliament
is
likely
to
make
a
great
bustle
before
they
will
give
the
king
any
money
will
call
all
things
in
question
and
above
all
the
expences
of
the
navy
and
do
enquire
into
the
expences
everywhere
and
into
the
truth
of
the
report
of
people
being
forced
to
sell
their
bills
at
per
cent
losse
in
the
navy
and
lastly
that
they
are
in
a
very
angry
pettish
mood
at
present
and
not
likely
to
be
better
it
being
good
friday
our
dinner
was
only
and
fish
the
only
time
that
we
have
had
a
lenten
dinner
all
this
lent
to
paul
church
yard
to
cause
the
title
of
my
english
mare
clausum
to
be
changed
and
the
new
title
dedicated
to
the
king
to
be
put
to
it
because
i
am
ashamed
to
have
the
other
seen
dedicated
to
the
commonwealth
with
sir
carteret
and
sir
john
minnes
to
my
lord
treasurer
thinking
to
have
spoken
about
getting
money
for
paying
the
yards
but
we
found
him
with
some
ladies
at
cards
and
so
it
being
a
bad
time
to
speak
we
parted
this
day
the
little
duke
of
monmouth
was
marryed
at
white
hall
in
the
chamber
and
is
a
great
supper
and
dancing
at
his
lodgings
near
i
observed
his
coate
at
the
tail
of
his
coach
he
gives
the
arms
of
england
scotland
and
france
quartered
upon
some
other
fields
but
what
it
is
that
speaks
his
being
a
bastard
i
know
not
i
did
hear
that
the
queene
is
much
grieved
of
late
at
the
king
neglecting
her
he
having
not
supped
once
with
her
this
quarter
of
a
year
and
almost
every
night
with
my
lady
castlemaine
who
hath
been
with
him
this
george
feast
at
windsor
and
come
home
with
him
last
night
and
which
is
more
they
say
is
removed
as
to
her
bed
from
her
own
home
to
a
chamber
in
white
hall
next
to
the
king
owne
which
i
am
sorry
to
hear
though
i
love
her
much
by
water
to
white
hall
but
found
the
duke
of
york
gone
to
james
for
this
summer
and
thence
with
coventry
and
sir
pen
up
to
the
duke
closet
and
a
good
while
with
him
about
navy
business
and
so
i
to
white
hall
and
there
a
long
while
with
my
lord
sandwich
discoursing
about
his
debt
to
the
navy
wherein
he
hath
given
me
some
things
to
resolve
him
in
the
queene
which
i
did
not
know
it
seems
was
at
windsor
at
the
late
george
feast
there
and
the
duke
of
monmouth
dancing
with
her
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
the
king
came
in
and
kissed
him
and
made
him
put
on
his
hat
which
every
body
took
notice
of
to
chelsey
where
we
found
my
lord
all
alone
with
one
joynt
of
meat
at
dinner
and
mightily
extolling
the
manner
of
his
retirement
and
the
goodness
of
his
diet
the
mistress
of
the
house
hath
all
things
most
excellently
dressed
among
others
her
cakes
admirable
and
so
good
that
my
lord
words
were
they
were
fit
to
present
to
my
lady
castlemaine
from
ordinary
discourse
my
lord
fell
to
talk
of
other
matters
to
me
of
which
chiefly
the
second
part
of
the
fray
which
he
told
me
a
little
while
since
of
between
edward
montagu
and
himself
that
he
hath
forborn
coming
to
him
almost
two
months
and
do
speak
not
only
slightly
of
my
lord
every
where
but
hath
complained
to
my
lord
chancellor
of
him
and
arrogated
all
that
ever
my
lord
hath
done
to
be
only
by
his
direction
and
persuasion
whether
he
hath
done
the
like
to
the
king
or
no
my
lord
knows
not
but
my
lord
hath
been
with
the
king
since
and
finds
all
things
fair
and
my
lord
chancellor
hath
told
him
of
it
but
he
so
much
contemns
montagu
as
my
lord
knows
himself
very
secure
against
any
thing
the
fool
can
do
and
notwithstanding
all
this
so
noble
is
his
nature
that
he
professes
himself
ready
to
show
kindness
and
pity
to
montagu
on
any
occasion
my
lord
told
me
of
his
presenting
sir
bennet
with
a
gold
cup
of
which
he
refuses
with
a
compliment
but
my
lord
would
have
been
glad
he
had
taken
it
that
be
might
have
had
some
obligations
upon
him
which
he
thinks
possible
the
other
may
refuse
to
prevent
it
not
that
he
hath
any
reason
to
doubt
his
kindness
but
i
perceive
great
differences
there
are
at
court
and
sir
bennet
and
my
lord
bristol
and
their
faction
are
likely
to
carry
all
things
before
them
which
my
lord
judgement
is
will
not
be
for
the
best
and
particularly
against
the
chancellor
who
he
tells
me
is
irrecoverably
lost
but
however
that
he
do
so
not
actually
joyne
in
any
thing
against
the
chancellor
whom
he
do
own
to
be
a
most
sure
friend
and
to
have
been
his
greatest
and
therefore
will
not
openly
act
in
either
but
passively
carry
himself
even
the
queene
my
lord
tells
me
he
thinks
he
hath
incurred
some
displeasure
with
for
his
kindness
to
his
neighbour
my
lady
castlemaine
my
lord
tells
me
he
hath
no
reason
to
fall
for
her
sake
whose
wit
management
nor
interest
is
not
likely
to
hold
up
any
man
and
therefore
he
thinks
it
not
his
obligation
to
stand
for
her
against
his
own
interest
the
duke
and
coventry
my
lord
sees
he
is
very
well
with
and
fears
not
but
they
will
show
themselves
his
very
good
friends
specially
at
this
time
he
being
able
to
serve
them
and
they
needing
him
which
he
did
not
tell
me
wherein
talking
of
the
business
of
tangier
he
tells
me
that
my
lord
teviott
is
gone
away
without
the
least
respect
paid
to
him
nor
indeed
to
any
man
but
without
his
commission
and
if
it
be
true
what
he
says
having
laid
out
seven
or
eight
thousand
pounds
in
commodities
for
the
place
and
besides
having
not
only
disobliged
all
the
commissioners
for
tangier
but
also
sir
charles
barkeley
the
other
day
who
spoke
in
behalf
of
colonel
that
having
been
there
already
he
ought
to
have
expected
and
had
the
governorship
upon
the
death
or
removal
of
the
former
governor
and
whereas
it
is
said
that
he
and
his
men
are
irish
which
is
indeed
the
main
thing
that
hath
moved
the
king
and
council
to
put
in
teviott
to
prevent
the
irish
having
too
great
and
the
whole
command
there
under
he
further
said
that
there
was
never
an
englishman
fit
to
command
tangier
my
lord
teviott
answered
yes
there
were
many
more
fit
than
himself
or
either
so
that
being
so
great
with
the
duke
of
york
and
being
already
made
governor
independent
of
my
lord
teviott
and
he
being
also
left
here
behind
him
for
a
while
my
lord
sandwich
do
think
that
putting
all
these
things
together
the
few
friends
he
hath
left
and
the
ill
posture
of
his
affairs
my
lord
teviott
is
not
a
man
of
the
conduct
and
management
that
either
people
take
him
to
be
or
is
fit
for
the
command
of
the
place
and
here
speaking
of
the
duke
of
york
and
sir
charles
barkeley
my
lord
tells
me
that
he
do
very
much
admire
the
good
management
and
discretion
and
nobleness
of
the
duke
that
however
he
may
be
led
by
him
or
coventry
singly
in
private
yet
he
did
not
observe
that
in
public
matters
but
he
did
give
as
ready
hearing
and
as
good
acceptance
to
any
reasons
offered
by
any
other
man
against
the
opinions
of
them
as
he
did
to
them
and
would
concur
in
the
prosecution
of
it
then
we
come
to
discourse
upon
his
own
and
come
to
a
resolution
how
to
proceed
in
them
wherein
though
i
offered
him
a
way
of
evading
the
greatest
part
of
his
debt
honestly
by
making
himself
debtor
to
the
parliament
before
the
king
time
which
he
might
justly
do
yet
he
resolved
to
go
openly
and
nakedly
in
it
and
put
himself
to
the
kindness
of
the
king
and
duke
which
humour
i
must
confess
and
so
did
tell
him
with
which
he
was
not
a
little
pleased
had
thriven
very
well
with
him
being
known
to
be
a
man
of
candid
and
open
dealing
without
any
private
tricks
or
hidden
designs
as
other
men
commonly
have
in
what
they
do
from
that
we
had
discourse
of
sir
carteret
and
of
many
others
and
upon
the
whole
i
do
find
that
it
is
a
troublesome
thing
for
a
man
of
any
condition
at
court
to
carry
himself
even
and
without
contracting
envy
or
envyers
and
that
much
discretion
and
dissimulation
is
necessary
to
do
it
may
to
james
where
coventry
sir
pen
and
i
staid
for
the
duke
coming
in
but
not
coming
we
walked
to
white
hall
and
meeting
the
king
we
followed
him
into
the
parke
where
coventry
and
he
talking
of
building
a
new
yacht
out
of
his
private
purse
he
having
some
contrivance
of
his
own
the
talk
being
done
we
fell
off
to
white
hall
leaving
the
king
in
the
park
and
going
back
met
the
duke
going
towards
to
meet
us
so
he
turned
back
again
and
to
his
closet
at
white
hall
and
there
my
lord
sandwich
present
we
did
our
weekly
errand
and
so
broke
up
and
i
to
the
garden
with
my
lord
sandwich
after
we
had
sat
an
hour
at
the
tangier
committee
and
after
talking
largely
of
his
own
businesses
we
began
to
talk
how
matters
are
at
court
and
though
he
did
not
flatly
tell
me
any
such
thing
yet
i
do
suspect
that
all
is
not
kind
between
the
king
and
the
duke
and
that
the
king
fondness
to
the
little
duke
do
occasion
it
and
it
may
be
that
there
is
some
fear
of
his
being
made
heire
to
the
crown
but
this
my
lord
did
not
tell
me
but
is
my
guess
only
and
that
my
lord
chancellor
is
without
doubt
falling
past
hopes
with
sir
minnes
he
telling
many
old
stories
of
the
navy
and
of
the
state
of
the
navy
at
the
beginning
of
the
late
troubles
and
i
am
troubled
at
my
heart
to
think
and
shall
hereafter
cease
to
wonder
at
the
bad
success
of
the
cause
when
such
a
knave
as
he
if
it
be
true
what
he
says
had
the
whole
management
of
the
fleet
and
the
design
of
putting
out
of
my
lord
warwicke
henry
rich
earl
of
warwick
and
holland
beheaded
for
putting
himself
in
arms
to
aid
charles
i
and
carrying
the
fleet
to
the
king
wherein
he
failed
most
fatally
to
the
king
ruine
to
the
exchange
with
creed
where
we
met
sir
minnes
who
tells
us
in
great
heat
that
the
parliament
will
make
mad
work
that
they
will
render
all
men
incapable
of
any
military
or
civil
employment
that
have
borne
arms
in
the
late
troubles
against
the
king
excepting
some
persons
which
if
it
be
so
as
i
hope
it
is
not
will
give
great
cause
of
discontent
and
i
doubt
will
have
but
bad
effects
sir
thomas
crewe
this
day
tells
me
that
the
queene
hearing
that
there
was
per
annum
brought
into
her
account
among
the
other
expences
of
the
crown
before
the
committee
of
parliament
she
took
order
to
let
them
know
that
she
hath
yet
for
the
payment
of
her
whole
family
received
but
which
is
a
notable
act
of
spirit
and
i
believe
is
true
to
my
lord
crewe
and
there
dined
with
him
he
tells
me
of
the
order
the
house
of
commons
have
made
for
the
drawing
an
act
for
the
rendering
none
capable
of
preferment
or
employment
in
the
state
but
who
have
been
loyall
and
constant
to
the
king
and
church
which
will
be
fatal
to
a
great
many
and
makes
me
doubt
lest
i
myself
with
all
my
innocence
during
the
late
times
should
be
brought
in
being
employed
in
the
exchequer
but
i
hope
god
will
provide
for
me
put
on
a
black
cloth
suit
with
white
lynings
under
all
as
the
fashion
is
to
wear
to
appear
under
the
breeches
i
walked
to
james
and
was
there
at
masse
and
was
forced
in
the
croud
to
kneel
down
and
masse
being
done
to
the
head
ordinary
where
many
and
most
of
their
talk
was
about
the
news
from
scotland
that
the
bishop
of
galloway
was
besieged
in
his
house
by
some
women
and
had
like
to
have
been
outraged
but
i
know
not
how
he
was
secured
which
is
bad
news
and
looks
as
it
did
in
the
beginning
of
the
late
troubles
from
thence
they
talked
of
rebellion
and
i
perceive
they
make
it
their
great
maxime
to
be
sure
to
master
the
city
of
london
whatever
comes
of
it
or
from
it
with
sir
pen
to
james
where
we
attended
the
duke
of
york
and
among
other
things
sir
carteret
and
i
had
a
great
dispute
about
the
different
value
of
the
pieces
of
eight
rated
by
creed
at
and
and
by
pitts
at
and
which
was
the
greatest
husbandry
to
the
king
he
proposing
that
the
greatest
sum
was
which
is
as
ridiculous
a
piece
of
ignorance
as
could
be
imagined
however
it
is
to
be
argued
at
the
board
and
reported
to
the
duke
next
week
which
i
shall
do
with
advantage
i
hope
i
went
homeward
after
a
little
discourse
with
pierce
the
surgeon
who
tells
me
that
my
lady
castlemaine
hath
now
got
lodgings
near
the
king
chamber
at
court
and
that
the
other
day
clarke
and
he
did
dissect
two
bodies
a
man
and
a
woman
before
the
king
with
which
the
king
was
highly
pleased
met
moore
and
with
him
to
an
in
holborne
where
in
discourse
he
told
me
that
he
fears
the
king
will
be
tempted
to
endeavour
the
setting
the
crown
upon
the
little
duke
which
may
cause
troubles
which
god
forbid
unless
it
be
his
due
he
told
me
my
lord
do
begin
to
settle
to
business
again
and
that
the
king
did
send
for
him
the
other
day
to
my
lady
castlemaine
to
play
at
cards
where
he
lost
for
which
i
am
sorry
though
he
says
my
lord
was
pleased
at
it
and
said
he
would
be
glad
at
any
time
to
lose
for
the
king
to
send
for
him
to
play
which
i
do
not
so
well
like
i
walked
in
the
parke
discoursing
with
the
keeper
of
the
pell
mell
who
was
sweeping
of
it
who
told
me
of
what
the
earth
is
mixed
that
do
floor
the
mall
and
that
over
all
there
is
powdered
and
spread
to
keep
it
fast
which
however
in
dry
weather
turns
to
dust
and
deads
the
ball
thence
to
coventry
and
sitting
by
his
bedside
he
did
tell
me
that
he
did
send
for
me
to
discourse
upon
my
lord
allowances
for
his
several
pays
and
what
his
thoughts
are
concerning
his
demands
which
he
could
not
take
the
freedom
to
do
face
to
face
it
being
not
so
proper
as
by
me
and
did
give
me
a
most
friendly
and
ingenuous
account
of
all
telling
me
how
unsafe
at
this
juncture
while
every
man
and
his
actions
particularly
are
descanted
upon
it
is
either
for
him
to
put
the
duke
upon
doing
or
my
lord
himself
to
desire
anything
extraordinary
the
king
having
been
so
bountifull
already
which
the
world
takes
notice
of
even
to
some
repinings
all
which
he
did
desire
me
to
discourse
to
my
lord
of
which
i
have
undertaken
to
do
at
noon
by
coach
to
my
lord
crewe
hearing
that
my
lord
sandwich
dined
there
where
i
told
him
what
had
passed
between
coventry
and
myself
with
which
he
was
contented
though
i
could
perceive
not
very
well
pleased
and
i
do
believe
that
my
lord
do
find
some
other
things
go
against
his
mind
in
the
house
for
in
the
motion
made
the
other
day
in
the
house
by
my
lord
bruce
that
none
be
capable
of
employment
but
such
as
have
been
loyal
and
constant
to
the
king
and
church
that
the
general
and
my
lord
were
mentioned
to
be
excepted
and
my
lord
bruce
did
come
since
to
my
lord
to
clear
himself
that
he
meant
nothing
to
his
prejudice
nor
could
it
have
any
such
effect
if
he
did
mean
it
after
discourse
with
my
lord
to
dinner
with
him
there
dining
there
my
lord
montagu
of
boughton
edward
second
lord
montagu
of
boughton
in
succeeded
his
father
who
had
been
created
a
baron
by
james
and
died
leaving
a
son
afterwards
duke
of
montagu
william
montagu
his
brother
the
queene
sollicitor
and
a
fine
dinner
their
talk
about
a
ridiculous
two
days
ago
at
my
lord
of
oxford
house
at
an
entertainment
of
his
there
being
there
my
lord
of
albemarle
lynsey
two
of
the
porters
my
lord
bellasses
and
others
where
there
were
high
words
and
some
blows
and
pulling
off
of
perriwiggs
till
my
lord
monk
took
away
some
of
their
swords
and
sent
for
some
soldiers
to
guard
the
house
till
the
fray
was
ended
to
such
a
degree
of
madness
the
nobility
of
this
age
is
come
after
dinner
i
went
up
to
sir
thomas
crewe
who
lies
there
not
very
well
in
his
head
being
troubled
with
vapours
and
fits
of
dizzinesse
and
there
i
sat
talking
with
him
all
the
afternoon
upon
the
unhappy
posture
of
things
at
this
time
that
the
king
do
mind
nothing
but
pleasures
and
hates
the
very
sight
or
thoughts
of
business
if
any
of
the
sober
counsellors
give
him
good
advice
and
move
him
in
any
way
that
is
to
his
good
and
honour
the
other
part
which
are
his
counsellors
of
pleasure
take
him
when
he
is
with
my
lady
castlemaine
and
in
a
humour
of
delight
and
then
persuade
him
that
he
ought
not
to
hear
or
listen
to
the
advice
of
those
old
dotards
or
counsellors
that
were
heretofore
his
enemies
when
god
knows
it
is
they
that
do
most
study
his
honour
it
seems
the
present
favourites
now
are
my
lord
bristol
duke
of
buckingham
sir
bennet
my
lord
ashley
and
sir
charles
barkeley
who
among
them
have
cast
my
lord
chancellor
upon
his
back
past
ever
getting
up
again
there
being
now
little
for
him
to
do
and
he
waits
at
court
attending
to
speak
to
the
king
as
others
do
which
i
pray
god
may
prove
of
good
effects
for
it
is
feared
it
will
be
the
same
with
my
lord
treasurer
shortly
but
strange
to
hear
how
my
lord
ashley
by
my
lord
bristol
means
he
being
brought
over
to
the
catholique
party
against
the
bishops
whom
he
hates
to
the
death
and
publicly
rails
against
them
not
that
he
is
become
a
catholique
but
merely
opposes
the
bishops
and
yet
for
aught
i
hear
the
bishop
of
london
keeps
as
great
with
the
king
as
ever
is
got
into
favour
so
much
that
being
a
man
of
great
business
and
yet
of
pleasure
and
drolling
too
he
it
is
thought
will
be
made
lord
treasurer
upon
the
death
or
removal
of
the
good
old
man
the
earl
of
southampton
my
lord
albemarle
i
hear
do
bear
through
and
bustle
among
them
and
will
not
be
removed
from
the
king
good
opinion
and
favour
though
none
of
the
cabinet
but
yet
he
is
envied
enough
it
is
made
very
doubtful
whether
the
king
do
not
intend
the
making
of
the
duke
of
monmouth
legitimate
but
surely
the
commons
of
england
will
never
do
it
nor
the
duke
of
york
suffer
it
whose
lady
i
am
told
is
very
troublesome
to
him
by
her
jealousy
no
care
is
observed
to
be
taken
of
the
main
chance
either
for
maintaining
of
trade
or
opposing
of
factions
which
god
knows
are
ready
to
break
out
if
any
of
them
which
god
forbid
should
dare
to
begin
the
king
and
every
man
about
him
minding
so
much
their
pleasures
or
profits
my
lord
hinchingbroke
i
am
told
hath
had
a
mischance
to
kill
his
boy
by
his
going
off
as
he
was
a
fowling
the
gun
was
charged
with
small
shot
and
hit
the
boy
in
the
face
and
about
the
temples
and
he
lived
four
days
in
scotland
it
seems
for
all
the
newsbooks
tell
us
every
week
that
they
are
all
so
quiet
and
every
thing
in
the
church
settled
the
old
woman
had
liked
to
have
killed
the
other
day
the
bishop
of
galloway
and
not
half
the
churches
of
the
whole
kingdom
conform
strange
were
the
effects
of
the
late
thunder
and
lightning
about
a
week
since
at
northampton
coming
with
great
rain
which
caused
extraordinary
floods
in
a
few
houres
bearing
away
bridges
drowning
horses
men
and
cattle
two
men
passing
over
a
bridge
on
horseback
the
arches
before
and
behind
them
were
borne
away
and
that
left
which
they
were
upon
but
however
one
of
the
horses
fell
over
and
was
drowned
stacks
of
faggots
carried
as
high
as
a
steeple
and
other
dreadful
things
which
sir
thomas
crewe
showed
me
letters
to
him
about
from
freemantle
and
others
that
it
is
very
true
the
portugalls
have
choused
us
it
seems
in
the
island
of
bombay
in
the
east
indys
for
after
a
great
charge
of
our
fleets
being
sent
thither
with
full
commission
from
the
king
of
portugall
to
receive
it
the
governour
by
some
pretence
or
other
will
not
deliver
it
to
sir
abraham
shipman
sent
from
the
king
nor
to
my
lord
of
marlborough
james
ley
third
earl
of
marlborough
killed
in
the
great
with
the
dutch
which
the
king
takes
highly
ill
and
i
fear
our
queene
will
fare
the
worse
for
it
the
dutch
decay
there
exceedingly
it
being
believed
that
their
people
will
revolt
from
them
there
and
they
forced
to
give
up
their
trade
sir
thomas
showed
me
his
picture
and
sir
anthony
vandyke
in
crayon
in
little
done
exceedingly
well
i
walked
to
white
hall
and
into
the
parke
seeing
the
queene
and
maids
of
honour
passing
through
the
house
going
to
the
parke
but
above
all
stuart
is
a
fine
woman
and
they
say
now
a
common
mistress
to
the
king
as
my
lady
castlemaine
is
which
is
a
great
pity
with
sir
john
minnes
to
the
tower
and
by
slingsby
and
howard
controller
of
the
mint
we
were
shown
the
method
of
making
this
new
money
that
being
done
the
controller
would
have
us
dine
with
him
and
his
company
the
king
giving
them
a
dinner
every
day
and
very
merry
and
good
discourse
upon
the
business
we
have
been
upon
they
now
coyne
between
and
pounds
in
a
week
at
dinner
they
did
discourse
very
finely
to
us
of
the
probability
that
there
is
a
vast
deal
of
money
hid
in
the
land
from
this
that
in
king
charles
time
there
was
near
ten
millions
of
money
coyned
besides
what
was
then
in
being
of
king
james
and
queene
elizabeth
of
which
there
is
a
good
deal
at
this
day
in
being
next
that
there
was
but
coyned
of
the
harp
and
crosse
money
and
of
this
there
was
brought
in
upon
its
being
called
in
and
from
very
good
arguments
they
find
that
there
can
not
be
less
of
it
in
ireland
and
scotland
than
so
that
there
is
but
missing
and
of
that
suppose
that
there
should
be
not
above
still
remaining
either
melted
down
hid
or
lost
or
hoarded
up
in
england
there
will
then
be
but
left
to
be
thought
to
have
been
transported
now
if
in
twelve
years
time
lost
but
a
in
danger
of
being
transported
then
in
years
time
will
have
lost
but
and
odd
pounds
and
as
there
is
remaining
after
twelve
years
time
in
england
so
after
time
which
was
within
this
two
years
there
ought
in
proportion
to
have
resting
or
thereabouts
besides
king
james
and
queene
elizabeth
money
now
that
most
of
this
must
be
hid
is
evident
as
they
reckon
because
of
the
dearth
of
money
immediately
upon
the
calling
in
of
the
state
money
which
was
that
come
in
and
then
there
was
not
any
money
to
be
had
in
this
city
which
they
say
to
their
own
observation
and
knowledge
was
so
and
therefore
though
i
can
say
nothing
in
it
myself
i
do
not
dispute
it
to
white
hall
where
in
the
matted
gallery
coventry
was
who
told
us
how
the
parliament
have
required
of
sir
carteret
and
him
an
account
what
money
shall
be
necessary
to
be
settled
upon
the
navy
for
the
ordinary
charge
which
they
intend
to
report
per
annum
and
how
to
allott
this
we
met
this
afternoon
and
took
their
papers
for
our
perusal
and
so
parted
meeting
lewis
phillips
of
brampton
he
and
afterwards
others
tell
me
that
news
come
last
night
to
court
that
the
king
of
france
is
sick
of
the
spotted
fever
and
that
they
are
struck
in
again
and
this
afternoon
my
lord
mandeville
is
gone
from
the
king
to
make
him
a
visit
which
will
be
great
news
and
of
great
import
through
europe
by
and
by
in
comes
my
lord
sandwich
he
told
me
this
day
a
vote
hath
passed
that
the
king
grants
of
land
to
my
lord
monk
and
him
should
be
made
good
which
pleases
him
very
much
he
also
tells
me
that
things
do
not
go
right
in
the
house
with
coventry
i
suppose
he
means
in
the
business
of
selling
places
but
i
am
sorry
for
it
with
pett
to
my
lord
ashley
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
where
we
met
the
auditors
about
settling
the
business
of
the
accounts
of
persons
to
whom
money
is
due
before
the
king
time
in
the
navy
and
the
clearing
of
their
imprests
for
what
little
of
their
debts
they
have
received
i
find
my
lord
as
he
is
reported
a
very
ready
quiet
and
diligent
person
roger
pepys
tells
me
that
the
king
hath
sent
to
the
parliament
to
hasten
to
make
an
end
by
midsummer
because
of
his
going
into
the
country
so
they
have
set
upon
four
bills
to
dispatch
the
first
of
which
is
he
says
too
devilish
a
severe
act
against
conventicles
so
beyond
all
moderation
that
he
is
afraid
it
will
ruin
all
telling
me
that
it
is
matter
of
the
greatest
grief
to
him
in
the
world
that
he
should
be
put
upon
this
trust
of
being
a
because
he
says
nothing
is
done
that
he
can
see
out
of
any
truth
and
sincerity
but
mere
envy
and
design
then
into
the
great
garden
up
to
the
banqueting
house
and
there
by
my
lord
glass
we
drew
in
the
species
very
pretty
this
word
is
here
used
as
an
optical
term
and
signifies
the
image
painted
on
the
retina
of
the
eye
and
the
rays
of
light
reflected
from
the
several
points
of
the
surface
of
objects
afterwards
to
pins
creed
and
i
playing
against
my
lord
and
cooke
by
water
to
the
royal
theatre
but
that
was
so
full
they
told
us
we
could
have
no
room
and
so
to
the
duke
house
and
there
saw
hamlett
done
giving
us
fresh
reason
never
to
think
enough
of
betterton
who
should
we
see
come
upon
the
stage
but
gosnell
my
wife
maid
but
neither
spoke
danced
nor
sung
which
i
was
sorry
for
this
day
is
kept
strictly
as
a
being
the
coronation
creed
and
i
abroad
and
called
at
several
churches
and
it
is
a
wonder
to
see
and
by
that
to
guess
the
ill
temper
of
the
city
at
this
time
either
to
religion
in
general
or
to
the
king
that
in
some
churches
there
was
hardly
ten
people
and
those
poor
people
to
the
duke
house
and
there
saw
the
slighted
mayde
a
comedy
by
sir
robert
stapylton
wherein
gosnell
acted
aeromena
a
great
part
and
did
it
very
well
then
with
creed
to
see
the
german
princesse
mary
carleton
of
whom
see
more
june
following
and
april
at
the
house
at
westminster
this
month
the
greatest
news
is
the
height
and
heat
that
the
parliament
is
in
in
enquiring
into
the
revenue
which
displeases
the
court
and
their
backwardness
to
give
the
king
any
money
their
enquiring
into
the
selling
of
places
do
trouble
a
great
many
among
the
chief
my
lord
chancellor
against
whom
particularly
it
is
carried
and
coventry
for
which
i
am
sorry
the
king
of
france
was
given
out
to
be
poisoned
and
dead
but
it
proves
to
be
the
meazles
and
he
is
well
or
likely
to
be
soon
well
again
i
find
myself
growing
in
the
esteem
and
credit
that
i
have
in
the
office
and
i
hope
falling
to
my
business
again
will
confirm
me
in
it
june
the
duke
having
been
and
so
lately
come
home
and
gone
to
bed
we
could
not
see
him
and
we
walked
away
and
i
with
sir
minnes
to
the
strand
and
there
light
out
of
his
coach
and
walked
to
the
new
theatre
which
since
the
king
players
are
gone
to
the
royal
one
is
this
day
begun
to
be
employed
by
the
fencers
to
play
prizes
at
and
here
i
come
and
saw
the
first
prize
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
and
it
was
between
one
mathews
who
did
beat
at
all
weapons
and
one
westwicke
who
was
soundly
cut
several
times
both
in
the
head
and
legs
that
he
was
all
over
blood
and
other
deadly
blows
they
did
give
and
take
in
very
good
earnest
till
westwicke
was
in
a
sad
pickle
they
fought
at
eight
weapons
three
boutes
at
each
weapon
this
being
upon
a
private
quarrel
they
did
it
in
good
earnest
and
i
felt
one
of
the
swords
and
found
it
to
be
very
little
if
at
all
blunter
on
the
edge
than
the
common
swords
are
strange
to
see
what
a
deal
of
money
is
flung
to
them
both
upon
the
stage
between
every
boute
this
day
i
hear
at
court
of
the
great
plot
which
was
lately
discovered
in
ireland
made
among
the
presbyters
and
others
designing
to
cry
up
the
covenant
and
to
secure
dublin
castle
and
other
places
and
they
have
debauched
a
good
part
of
the
army
there
promising
them
ready
money
some
of
the
parliament
there
they
say
are
guilty
and
some
withdrawn
upon
it
several
persons
taken
and
among
others
a
son
of
scott
that
was
executed
here
for
the
murder
what
reason
the
king
hath
i
know
not
but
it
seems
he
is
doubtfull
of
scotland
and
this
afternoon
when
i
was
there
the
council
was
called
extraordinary
and
they
were
opening
the
letter
this
last
post
coming
and
going
between
scotland
and
us
and
other
places
the
king
of
france
is
well
again
to
james
to
coventry
where
i
had
an
private
talk
with
him
concerning
his
own
condition
at
present
being
under
the
censure
of
the
house
being
concerned
with
others
in
the
bill
for
selling
of
offices
he
tells
me
that
though
he
thinks
himself
to
suffer
much
in
his
fame
hereby
yet
he
values
nothing
more
of
evil
to
hang
over
him
for
that
it
is
against
no
statute
as
is
pretended
nor
more
than
what
his
predecessors
time
out
of
mind
have
taken
and
that
so
soon
as
he
found
himself
to
be
in
an
errour
he
did
desire
to
have
his
fees
set
which
was
done
and
since
that
time
he
hath
not
taken
a
token
more
he
undertakes
to
prove
that
he
did
never
take
a
token
of
any
captain
to
get
him
employed
in
his
life
beforehand
or
demanded
any
thing
and
for
the
other
accusation
that
the
cavaliers
are
not
employed
he
looked
over
the
list
of
them
now
in
the
service
and
of
the
that
are
employed
thirteen
have
been
heretofore
always
under
the
king
two
neutralls
and
the
other
twelve
men
of
great
courage
and
such
as
had
either
the
particular
command
or
great
recommendation
to
put
them
in
and
none
by
himself
besides
that
he
sees
it
is
not
the
king
nor
duke
opinion
that
the
whole
party
of
the
late
officers
should
be
rendered
desperate
and
lastly
he
confesses
that
the
more
of
the
cavaliers
are
put
in
the
less
of
discipline
hath
followed
in
the
fleet
and
that
whenever
there
comes
occasion
it
must
be
the
old
ones
that
must
do
any
good
he
tells
me
that
he
can
not
guess
whom
all
this
should
come
from
but
he
suspects
sir
carteret
as
i
also
do
at
least
that
he
is
pleased
with
it
but
he
tells
me
that
he
will
bring
sir
carteret
to
be
the
first
adviser
and
instructor
of
him
what
is
to
make
his
place
of
benefit
to
him
telling
him
that
smith
did
make
his
place
worth
and
he
believed
to
him
the
first
year
besides
something
else
greater
than
all
this
which
he
forbore
to
tell
me
it
seems
one
sir
thomas
tomkins
for
weobly
and
one
of
the
proposed
knights
of
the
royal
oak
for
herefordshire
of
the
house
that
makes
many
mad
motions
did
bring
it
into
the
house
saying
that
a
letter
was
left
at
his
lodgings
subscribed
by
one
benson
which
is
a
feigned
name
for
there
is
no
such
in
the
navy
telling
how
many
places
in
the
navy
have
been
sold
and
by
another
letter
left
in
the
same
manner
since
nobody
appearing
he
writes
him
that
there
is
one
hughes
and
another
butler
both
rogues
that
have
for
their
roguery
been
turned
out
of
their
places
that
will
swear
that
coventry
did
sell
their
places
and
other
things
i
offered
him
my
service
and
will
with
all
my
heart
serve
him
but
he
tells
me
he
do
not
think
it
convenient
to
meddle
or
to
any
purpose
to
westminster
hall
where
i
hear
more
of
the
plot
from
ireland
which
it
seems
hath
been
hatching
and
known
to
the
lord
lieutenant
a
great
while
and
kept
close
till
within
three
days
that
it
should
have
taken
effect
in
the
hall
a
good
while
where
i
heard
that
this
day
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
juxon
william
juxon
made
bishop
of
london
translated
to
canterbury
a
man
well
spoken
of
by
all
for
a
good
man
is
dead
and
the
bishop
of
london
gilbert
sheldon
who
did
succeed
him
is
to
have
his
seat
the
match
between
sir
cutts
of
childerley
near
cambridge
and
my
lady
jemimah
lady
jemimah
montagu
daughter
to
the
earl
of
sandwich
he
says
is
likely
to
go
on
for
which
i
am
glad
in
the
hall
pierce
tells
me
that
the
queene
begins
to
be
briske
and
play
like
other
ladies
and
is
quite
another
woman
from
what
she
was
it
may
be
it
may
make
the
king
like
her
the
better
and
forsake
his
two
mistresses
my
lady
castlemaine
and
stewart
spelt
indiscriminately
in
the
ms
stuart
steward
and
stewart
to
york
house
where
the
russia
embassador
do
lie
and
there
i
saw
his
people
go
up
and
down
louseing
themselves
they
are
all
in
a
great
hurry
being
to
be
gone
the
beginning
of
next
week
but
that
that
pleased
me
best
was
the
remains
of
the
noble
soul
of
the
late
duke
of
buckingham
appearing
in
his
house
in
every
place
in
the
and
the
windows
sir
john
hebden
the
russia
resident
did
tell
me
how
he
is
vexed
to
see
things
at
court
ordered
as
they
are
by
nobody
that
attends
to
business
but
every
man
himself
or
his
pleasures
he
cries
up
my
lord
ashley
to
be
almost
the
only
man
that
he
sees
to
look
after
business
and
with
the
ease
and
mastery
that
he
wonders
at
him
he
cries
out
against
the
king
dealing
so
much
with
goldsmiths
and
suffering
himself
to
have
his
purse
kept
and
commanded
by
them
he
tells
me
also
with
what
exact
care
and
order
the
states
of
holland
stores
are
kept
in
their
yards
and
every
thing
managed
there
by
their
builders
with
such
husbandry
as
is
not
imaginable
which
i
will
endeavour
to
understand
further
turner
who
is
often
at
court
do
tell
me
that
for
certain
the
queene
hath
much
changed
her
humour
and
is
become
very
pleasant
and
sociable
as
any
and
they
say
is
with
child
or
believed
to
be
so
after
church
to
sir
batten
where
my
lady
batten
enveighed
mightily
against
the
german
princesse
and
i
as
high
in
the
defence
of
her
wit
and
spirit
and
glad
that
she
is
cleared
at
the
sessions
to
the
royal
theatre
and
there
saw
the
committee
the
committee
a
comedy
by
sir
robert
howard
a
merry
but
indifferent
play
only
lacey
part
an
irish
footman
is
beyond
imagination
here
i
saw
my
lord
falconbridge
thos
bellasses
viscount
falconberg
frequently
called
falconbridge
married
mary
third
daughter
of
oliver
cromwell
she
died
and
his
lady
my
lady
mary
cromwell
who
looks
as
well
as
i
have
known
her
and
well
clad
but
when
the
house
began
to
fill
she
put
on
her
vizard
and
so
kept
it
on
all
the
play
which
of
late
is
become
a
great
fashion
among
the
ladies
which
hides
their
whole
face
so
to
the
exchange
to
buy
things
with
my
wife
among
others
a
vizard
for
herself
to
the
royal
theatre
and
in
our
way
saw
my
lady
castlemaine
who
i
fear
is
not
so
handsome
as
i
have
taken
her
for
and
now
she
begins
to
decay
something
this
is
my
opinion
also
yesterday
upon
conference
with
the
king
in
the
banqueting
house
the
parliament
did
agree
with
much
ado
it
being
carried
but
by
voices
that
they
would
supply
him
with
a
sum
of
money
but
what
and
how
is
not
yet
known
but
expected
to
be
done
with
great
disputes
the
next
week
but
if
done
at
all
it
is
well
to
the
trinity
house
where
among
others
i
found
my
lords
sandwich
and
craven
and
my
cousin
roger
pepys
and
sir
wm
wheeler
both
at
and
after
dinner
we
had
great
discourses
of
the
nature
and
spirits
and
whether
they
can
animate
dead
bodies
in
all
which
as
of
the
general
appearance
of
spirits
my
lord
sandwich
is
very
scepticall
he
says
the
greatest
warrants
that
ever
he
had
to
believe
any
is
the
present
appearing
of
the
devil
in
wiltshire
much
of
late
talked
of
who
beats
a
drum
up
and
down
there
are
books
of
it
and
they
say
very
true
but
my
lord
observes
that
though
he
do
answer
to
any
tune
that
you
will
play
to
him
upon
another
drum
yet
one
time
he
tried
to
play
and
could
not
which
makes
him
suspect
the
whole
and
i
think
it
is
a
good
argument
joseph
glanville
published
a
relation
of
the
famed
disturbance
at
the
house
of
mompesson
at
tedworth
wilts
occasioned
by
the
beating
of
an
invisible
drum
every
night
for
a
year
this
story
which
was
believed
at
the
time
furnished
the
plot
for
addison
play
of
the
drummer
or
the
haunted
house
in
the
mercurius
publicus
april
there
is
a
curious
examination
on
this
subject
by
which
it
appears
that
one
william
drury
of
uscut
wilts
was
the
invisible
drummer
dined
with
sir
batten
who
tells
me
that
the
house
have
voted
the
supply
intended
for
the
king
shall
be
by
subsidy
this
day
i
met
with
pierce
the
surgeon
who
tells
me
that
the
king
has
made
peace
between
edward
montagu
and
his
father
lord
montagu
and
that
all
is
well
again
at
which
for
the
family
sake
i
am
glad
but
do
not
think
it
will
hold
long
to
lambeth
expecting
to
have
seen
the
archbishop
lie
in
state
but
it
seems
he
is
not
laid
out
yet
at
the
privy
seale
office
examined
the
books
and
found
the
grant
of
increase
of
salary
to
the
principall
officers
in
the
year
among
the
controller
surveyor
and
clerk
to
the
shippes
met
captain
ferrers
who
tells
us
that
the
king
of
france
is
well
again
and
that
he
saw
him
train
his
guards
all
brave
men
at
paris
and
that
when
he
goes
to
his
mistress
madame
la
valiere
a
pretty
little
woman
now
with
child
by
him
he
goes
publicly
and
his
trumpets
and
with
him
and
yet
he
says
that
for
all
this
the
queene
do
not
know
of
it
for
that
nobody
dares
to
tell
her
but
that
i
dare
not
believe
to
westminster
where
all
along
i
find
the
shops
evening
with
the
sides
of
the
houses
even
in
the
broadest
streets
which
will
make
the
city
very
much
better
than
it
was
it
seems
the
house
do
consent
to
send
to
the
king
to
desire
that
he
would
be
graciously
pleased
to
let
them
know
who
it
was
that
did
inform
him
of
what
words
sir
richard
temple
sir
richard
temple
of
stowe
bart
for
buckingham
and
ob
should
say
which
were
to
this
purpose
that
if
the
king
would
side
with
him
or
be
guided
by
him
and
his
party
that
he
should
not
lack
money
but
without
knowing
who
told
it
they
do
not
think
fit
to
call
him
to
any
account
for
it
the
duke
being
gone
by
and
by
come
in
and
shifted
himself
he
having
in
his
hunting
led
his
horse
through
a
river
up
to
his
breast
and
came
so
home
and
being
ready
we
had
a
long
discourse
with
him
to
the
office
and
after
an
hour
or
two
by
water
to
the
temple
to
my
cousen
roger
who
i
perceive
is
a
deadly
high
man
in
the
parliament
business
and
against
the
court
showing
me
how
they
have
computed
that
the
king
hath
spent
at
least
hath
received
above
four
millions
of
money
since
he
come
in
and
in
sir
j
winter
case
in
which
i
spoke
to
him
he
is
so
high
that
he
says
he
deserves
to
be
hanged
to
the
and
by
and
by
comes
the
king
and
the
queene
by
in
great
state
and
the
streets
full
of
people
i
stood
in
balcone
they
dine
all
at
my
lord
mayor
but
what
he
do
for
victualls
or
room
for
them
i
know
not
to
and
there
an
hour
private
discourse
with
coventry
he
speaking
of
sir
carteret
slightly
and
diminishing
of
his
services
for
the
king
in
jersey
that
he
was
well
rewarded
and
had
good
lands
and
rents
and
other
profits
from
the
king
all
the
time
he
was
there
and
that
it
was
always
his
humour
to
have
things
done
his
way
he
brought
an
example
how
he
would
not
let
the
castle
there
be
victualled
for
more
than
a
month
that
so
he
might
keep
it
at
his
beck
though
the
people
of
the
town
did
offer
to
supply
it
more
often
themselves
another
thing
he
told
me
how
the
duke
of
york
did
give
sir
carteret
and
the
island
his
profit
as
admirall
and
other
things
toward
the
building
of
of
a
pier
there
but
it
was
never
laid
out
nor
like
to
be
so
it
falling
out
that
a
lady
being
brought
to
bed
the
duke
was
to
be
desired
to
be
one
of
the
godfathers
and
it
being
objected
that
that
would
not
be
proper
there
being
no
peer
of
the
land
to
be
joyned
with
him
the
lady
replied
why
let
him
choose
and
if
he
will
not
be
a
godfather
without
a
peer
then
let
him
even
stay
till
he
hath
made
a
pier
of
his
own
he
tells
me
too
that
he
hath
lately
been
observed
to
tack
about
at
court
and
to
endeavour
to
strike
in
with
the
persons
that
are
against
the
chancellor
but
this
he
says
of
him
that
he
do
not
say
nor
do
anything
to
the
prejudice
of
the
chancellor
but
he
told
me
that
the
chancellor
was
rising
again
and
that
of
late
sir
carteret
business
and
employment
hath
not
been
so
full
as
it
used
to
be
while
the
chancellor
stood
up
from
that
we
discoursed
of
the
evil
of
putting
out
men
of
experience
in
business
as
the
chancellor
and
of
the
condition
of
the
king
party
at
present
who
as
the
papists
though
otherwise
fine
persons
yet
being
by
law
kept
for
these
fourscore
years
out
of
employment
they
are
now
wholly
uncapable
of
business
and
so
the
cavaliers
for
twenty
years
who
says
he
for
the
most
part
have
either
given
themselves
over
to
look
after
country
and
family
business
and
those
the
best
of
them
and
the
rest
to
debauchery
and
that
was
it
that
hath
made
him
high
against
the
late
bill
brought
into
the
house
for
the
making
all
men
incapable
of
employment
that
had
served
against
the
king
people
says
he
in
the
it
is
impossible
to
do
any
thing
without
them
there
being
not
more
than
three
men
of
the
whole
king
side
that
are
fit
to
command
almost
and
these
were
captn
allen
smith
and
beech
probably
richard
beach
afterwards
knighted
and
in
commissioner
at
portsmouth
and
it
may
be
holmes
and
utber
and
batts
might
do
something
sir
carteret
did
tell
us
that
upon
tuesday
last
being
with
my
lord
treasurer
he
showed
him
a
letter
from
portugall
speaking
of
the
advance
of
the
spaniards
into
their
country
and
yet
that
the
portuguese
were
never
more
courageous
than
now
for
by
an
old
prophecy
sent
thither
some
years
though
not
many
since
from
the
french
king
it
is
foretold
that
the
spaniards
should
come
into
their
country
and
in
such
a
valley
they
should
be
all
killed
and
then
their
country
should
be
wholly
delivered
from
the
spaniards
this
was
on
tuesday
last
and
yesterday
come
the
very
first
news
that
in
this
valley
they
had
thus
routed
and
killed
the
spaniards
the
house
is
upon
the
king
answer
to
their
message
about
temple
which
is
that
my
lord
of
bristoll
did
tell
him
that
temple
did
say
those
words
so
the
house
are
resolved
upon
sending
some
of
their
members
to
him
to
know
the
truth
and
to
demand
satisfaction
if
it
be
not
true
sir
batten
sir
minnes
my
lady
batten
and
i
by
coach
to
bednall
green
to
sir
rider
to
dinner
a
fine
merry
walk
with
the
ladies
alone
after
dinner
in
the
garden
the
greatest
quantity
of
strawberrys
i
ever
saw
and
good
this
very
house
was
built
by
the
blind
beggar
of
bednall
green
so
much
talked
of
and
sang
in
ballads
but
they
say
it
was
only
some
of
the
outhouses
of
it
called
kirby
castle
the
property
of
sir
william
ryder
knight
who
died
herein
lysons
environs
at
table
discoursing
of
thunder
and
lightning
sir
rider
did
tell
a
story
of
his
own
knowledge
that
a
genoese
gally
in
legorne
roads
was
struck
by
thunder
so
as
the
mast
was
broke
and
the
shackle
upon
one
of
the
slaves
was
melted
clear
off
his
leg
without
hurting
his
leg
sir
william
went
on
board
the
vessel
and
would
have
contributed
toward
the
release
of
the
slave
whom
heaven
had
thus
set
free
but
he
could
not
compass
it
and
so
he
was
brought
to
his
fetters
again
up
and
down
the
streets
is
cried
mightily
the
great
victory
got
by
the
portugalls
against
the
spaniards
where
slain
or
taken
prisoners
with
all
the
artillery
baggage
money
and
don
john
he
was
a
natural
son
of
philip
iv
king
of
spain
who
after
his
father
death
in
exerted
his
whole
influence
to
overthrow
the
regency
appointed
during
the
young
king
minority
of
austria
forced
to
flee
with
a
man
or
two
with
him
public
matters
are
in
an
ill
condition
parliament
sitting
and
raising
four
subsidys
for
the
king
which
is
but
a
little
considering
his
wants
and
yet
that
parted
withal
with
great
hardness
they
being
offended
to
see
so
much
money
go
and
no
debts
of
the
public
paid
but
all
swallowed
by
a
luxurious
court
which
the
king
it
is
believed
and
hoped
will
retrench
in
a
little
time
when
he
comes
to
see
the
utmost
of
the
revenue
which
shall
be
settled
on
him
he
expecting
to
have
his
made
good
to
him
which
is
not
yet
done
by
above
as
he
himself
reports
to
the
house
the
charge
the
navy
intended
to
be
limited
to
per
annum
the
ordinary
charge
of
it
and
that
to
be
settled
upon
the
customes
the
king
gets
greatly
taken
up
with
madam
castlemaine
and
stewart
which
heaven
put
an
end
to
july
being
in
the
parliament
lobby
i
there
saw
my
lord
of
bristoll
come
to
the
commons
house
to
give
his
answer
to
their
question
about
some
words
he
should
tell
the
king
that
were
spoke
by
sir
richard
temple
a
chair
was
set
at
the
bar
of
the
house
for
him
which
he
used
but
little
but
made
an
harangue
of
half
an
hour
bareheaded
the
house
covered
his
speech
being
done
he
come
out
into
a
little
room
till
the
house
had
concluded
of
an
answer
to
his
speech
which
they
staying
long
upon
i
went
away
and
by
and
by
out
comes
sis
batten
and
he
told
me
that
his
lordship
had
made
a
long
and
a
speech
and
delivered
with
such
action
as
was
not
becoming
his
lordship
he
confesses
he
did
tell
the
king
such
a
thing
of
sir
richard
temple
but
that
upon
his
honour
the
words
were
not
spoke
by
sir
richard
he
having
taken
a
liberty
of
enlarging
to
the
king
upon
the
discourse
which
had
been
between
sir
richard
and
himself
lately
and
so
took
upon
himself
the
whole
blame
and
desired
their
pardon
it
being
not
to
do
any
wrong
to
their
member
but
out
of
zeal
to
the
king
he
told
them
among
many
other
things
that
as
to
religion
he
was
a
roman
catholick
but
such
a
one
as
thought
no
man
to
have
right
to
the
crown
of
england
but
the
prince
that
hath
it
and
such
a
one
as
if
the
king
should
desire
counsel
as
to
his
own
he
would
not
advise
him
to
another
religion
than
the
old
true
reformed
religion
of
this
kingdom
as
it
now
stands
and
concluded
with
a
submission
to
what
the
house
shall
do
with
him
saying
that
whatever
they
shall
do
thanks
be
to
god
this
head
this
heart
and
this
sword
pointing
to
them
all
will
find
me
a
being
in
any
place
in
europe
the
house
hath
hereupon
voted
clearly
sir
richard
temple
to
be
free
from
the
imputation
of
saying
those
words
but
when
sir
william
batten
come
out
had
not
concluded
what
to
say
to
my
lord
it
being
argued
that
to
own
any
satisfaction
as
to
my
lord
from
his
speech
would
be
to
lay
some
fault
upon
the
king
for
the
message
he
should
upon
no
better
accounts
send
to
the
impeaching
of
one
of
their
members
walking
out
i
hear
that
the
house
of
lords
are
offended
that
my
lord
digby
digby
earl
of
bristol
should
come
to
this
house
and
make
a
speech
there
without
leave
first
asked
of
the
house
of
lords
i
hear
also
of
another
difficulty
now
upon
him
that
my
lord
of
sunderland
henry
fourth
lord
spence
and
second
earl
of
sunderland
ambassador
to
spain
ob
whom
i
do
not
know
was
so
near
to
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
as
that
the
were
made
and
portion
and
every
thing
agreed
on
and
ready
and
the
other
day
he
goes
away
nobody
yet
knows
whither
sending
her
the
next
morning
a
release
of
his
right
or
claim
to
her
and
advice
to
his
friends
not
to
enquire
into
the
reason
of
this
doing
for
he
hath
enough
for
it
and
that
he
gives
them
liberty
to
say
and
think
what
they
will
of
him
so
they
do
not
demand
the
reason
of
his
leaving
her
being
resolved
never
to
have
her
to
sir
batten
to
the
trinity
house
and
after
dinner
we
fell
batten
telling
us
of
a
late
triall
of
sir
charles
sedley
sir
charles
sedley
celebrated
for
his
wit
and
profligacy
and
author
of
several
plays
he
is
said
to
have
been
fined
for
this
outrage
he
was
father
to
james
ii
mistress
created
countess
of
dorchester
and
died
the
other
day
before
my
lord
chief
justice
foster
sir
robert
foster
knt
chief
justice
of
the
king
bench
ob
and
the
whole
bench
for
his
debauchery
a
little
while
since
at
oxford
kate
the
details
in
the
original
are
too
gross
to
print
it
seems
my
lord
and
the
rest
of
the
judges
did
all
of
them
round
give
him
a
most
high
reproofe
my
lord
chief
justice
saying
that
it
was
for
him
and
such
wicked
wretches
as
he
was
that
god
anger
and
judgments
hung
over
us
calling
him
sirrah
many
times
it
seems
they
have
bound
him
to
his
good
behaviour
there
being
no
law
against
him
for
it
in
it
being
told
that
my
lord
buckhurst
was
there
my
lord
asked
whether
it
was
that
buckhurst
that
was
lately
tried
for
robbery
see
an
account
of
this
february
and
when
answered
yes
he
asked
whether
he
had
so
soon
forgot
his
deliverance
at
that
time
and
that
it
would
have
more
become
him
to
have
been
at
his
prayers
begging
god
forgiveness
than
now
running
into
such
courses
again
this
day
i
hear
at
dinner
that
don
john
of
austria
since
his
flight
out
of
portugall
is
dead
of
his
wounds
so
there
is
a
great
man
gone
and
a
great
dispute
like
to
be
indeed
for
the
crown
of
spayne
if
the
king
should
have
died
before
him
my
cousin
roger
told
us
the
whole
passage
of
my
lord
digby
much
as
i
have
said
here
above
only
that
he
did
say
that
he
would
draw
his
sword
against
the
pope
himself
if
he
should
offer
any
thing
against
his
majesty
and
the
good
of
these
nations
and
that
he
never
was
the
man
that
did
either
look
for
a
cap
for
himself
or
any
body
else
meaning
abbot
montagu
walter
second
son
to
the
first
earl
of
manchester
embracing
the
catholic
religion
while
on
his
travels
was
made
abbot
of
ponthoise
through
the
influence
of
mary
de
medici
he
afterwards
became
almoner
to
the
of
england
and
died
and
the
house
upon
the
whole
did
vote
sir
richard
temple
innocent
and
that
my
lord
digby
hath
cleared
the
honour
of
his
majesty
and
sir
richard
temple
and
given
perfect
satisfaction
of
his
own
respects
to
the
house
walking
in
the
garden
this
evening
with
sir
carteret
and
sir
minnes
sir
carteret
told
us
with
great
content
how
like
a
my
lord
digby
spoke
yesterday
pointing
to
his
head
as
my
lord
did
and
saying
first
for
his
head
says
sir
carteret
i
know
when
a
calfe
head
would
have
done
better
by
half
for
his
heart
and
his
sword
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
them
he
told
us
that
for
certain
his
head
cost
the
late
king
his
for
it
was
he
that
broke
off
the
treaty
at
uxbridge
he
told
us
also
how
great
a
man
he
was
raised
from
a
private
gentleman
in
france
by
monsieur
grandmont
and
afterwards
by
the
cardinal
who
raised
him
to
be
a
and
then
higher
and
entrusted
by
the
cardinal
when
he
was
banished
out
of
france
with
great
matters
and
recommended
by
him
to
the
queene
as
a
man
to
be
trusted
and
ruled
by
yet
when
he
come
to
have
some
power
over
the
queene
he
begun
to
dissuade
her
from
her
opinion
of
the
cardinal
which
she
said
nothing
to
till
the
cardinal
cardinal
mazarin
was
returned
and
then
she
told
him
of
it
who
told
my
lord
digby
et
bien
monsieur
vous
estes
un
fort
bon
amy
donc
but
presently
put
him
out
of
all
and
then
from
a
certainty
of
coming
in
two
or
three
years
time
to
be
mareschall
of
france
to
which
all
strangers
even
protestants
and
those
as
often
as
french
themselves
are
capable
of
coming
though
it
be
one
of
the
greatest
places
in
france
he
was
driven
to
go
out
of
france
into
flanders
but
there
was
not
trusted
nor
received
any
kindness
from
the
prince
of
conde
as
one
to
whom
also
he
had
been
false
as
he
had
been
to
the
cardinal
and
grandmont
in
fine
he
told
us
that
he
is
a
man
of
excellent
parts
but
of
no
great
faith
nor
judgment
and
one
very
easy
to
get
up
to
great
height
of
preferment
but
never
able
to
hold
it
moore
tells
me
great
news
that
my
lady
castlemaine
is
fallen
from
court
and
this
morning
retired
he
gives
me
no
account
of
the
reason
but
that
it
is
so
for
which
i
am
sorry
and
yet
if
the
king
do
it
to
leave
off
not
only
her
but
all
other
mistresses
i
should
be
heartily
glad
of
it
that
he
may
fall
to
look
after
business
i
hear
my
lord
digby
is
condemned
at
court
for
his
speech
and
that
my
lord
chancellor
grows
great
again
with
creed
over
the
water
to
lambeth
but
could
not
see
the
archbishop
hearse
so
over
the
fields
to
southwarke
i
spent
half
an
hour
in
mary
overy
church
where
are
fine
monuments
of
great
antiquity
sir
allen
apsley
sir
allen
apsley
a
faithful
adherent
to
charles
after
the
restoration
was
made
falconer
to
the
king
and
almoner
to
the
duke
of
york
in
whose
regiment
he
bore
a
commission
he
was
in
for
thetford
and
died
showed
the
duke
the
lisbon
gazette
in
spanish
where
the
late
victory
is
set
down
particularly
and
to
the
great
honour
of
the
english
beyond
measure
they
have
since
taken
back
evora
which
was
lost
to
the
spaniards
the
english
making
the
assault
and
lost
not
more
than
three
men
here
i
learnt
that
the
english
foot
are
highly
esteemed
all
over
the
world
but
the
horse
not
so
much
which
yet
we
count
among
ourselves
the
best
but
they
abroad
have
had
no
great
knowledge
of
our
horse
it
seems
to
the
king
head
ordinary
and
a
pretty
gentleman
in
our
company
who
confirms
my
lady
castlemaine
being
gone
from
court
but
knows
not
the
reason
he
told
us
of
one
wipe
the
queene
a
little
while
ago
did
give
her
when
she
come
in
and
found
the
queene
under
the
dresser
hands
and
had
been
so
long
i
wonder
your
majesty
says
she
can
have
the
patience
to
sit
so
long
dressing
i
have
so
much
reason
to
use
patience
says
the
queene
that
i
can
very
well
bear
with
it
he
thinks
it
may
be
the
queene
hath
commanded
her
to
retire
though
that
is
not
likely
thence
with
creed
to
hire
a
coach
to
carry
us
to
hide
parke
there
being
a
general
muster
of
the
king
guards
horse
and
foot
but
they
demand
so
high
that
i
spying
cutler
the
merchant
did
take
notice
of
him
and
he
going
into
his
coach
and
telling
me
that
he
was
going
to
the
muster
i
asked
and
went
along
with
him
where
a
goodly
sight
to
see
so
many
fine
horses
and
officers
and
the
king
duke
and
others
come
by
horseback
and
the
two
queenes
in
the
coach
my
lady
castlemaine
not
being
there
and
after
long
being
there
i
light
and
walked
to
the
place
where
the
king
duke
did
stand
to
see
the
horse
and
foot
march
by
and
discharge
their
guns
to
show
a
french
marquisse
for
whom
this
muster
was
caused
the
goodness
of
our
firemen
which
indeed
was
very
good
though
not
without
a
slip
now
and
then
and
one
broadside
close
to
our
coach
we
had
going
out
of
the
park
even
to
the
nearnesse
as
to
be
ready
to
burn
our
hairs
yet
methought
all
these
gay
men
are
not
the
soldiers
that
must
do
the
king
business
it
being
such
as
these
that
lost
the
old
king
all
he
had
and
were
beat
by
the
most
ordinary
fellows
that
could
be
thence
with
much
ado
out
of
the
park
and
through
james
down
the
waterside
over
to
lambeth
to
see
the
archhishop
corps
who
is
to
be
carried
away
to
oxford
on
monday
but
come
too
late
this
day
in
the
duke
chamber
there
being
a
roman
story
in
the
hangings
and
upon
the
standard
written
these
four
letters
sir
carteret
came
to
me
to
know
what
the
meaning
of
those
four
letters
were
which
ignorance
is
not
to
be
borne
in
a
privy
counsellor
methinks
what
a
schoolboy
should
be
whipt
for
not
knowing
at
my
office
all
the
morning
writing
of
a
list
of
the
king
ships
in
my
navy
collections
with
great
pleasure
in
pett
garden
i
eat
some
of
the
first
cherries
i
have
eat
this
year
off
the
tree
where
the
king
himself
had
been
gathering
some
this
morning
deane
tells
me
that
pett
did
that
my
lord
bristoll
told
the
king
that
he
will
impeach
the
chancellor
of
high
treason
but
i
find
that
my
lord
bristoll
hath
undone
himself
already
in
everybody
opinion
and
now
he
endeavours
to
raise
dust
to
put
out
other
men
eyes
as
well
as
his
own
but
i
hope
it
will
not
take
in
consideration
merely
that
it
is
hard
for
a
prince
to
spare
an
experienced
old
officer
be
he
never
so
corrupt
though
i
hope
this
man
is
not
so
as
some
report
him
to
be
he
tells
me
that
don
john
is
yet
alive
and
not
killed
as
was
said
in
the
great
victory
against
the
spaniards
in
portugall
of
late
sir
pen
tells
me
my
lady
castlemaine
was
at
court
for
all
this
talk
this
week
but
it
seems
the
king
is
stranger
than
ordinary
to
her
i
met
pierce
the
chirurgeon
who
tells
me
that
for
certain
the
king
is
grown
colder
to
my
lady
castlemaine
than
ordinary
and
that
he
believes
he
begins
to
love
the
queene
and
do
make
much
of
her
more
than
he
used
to
do
coventry
tells
me
that
my
lord
bristoll
hath
this
day
impeached
my
lord
chancellor
in
the
house
of
lords
of
high
treason
the
chief
of
the
articles
are
these
that
he
should
be
the
occasion
of
the
peace
made
with
holland
lately
upon
such
disadvantageous
terms
and
that
he
was
bribed
to
it
that
dunkirke
was
also
sold
by
his
advice
chiefly
so
much
to
the
damage
of
england
that
he
had
given
him
for
the
or
promoting
of
the
irish
declaration
lately
concerning
the
division
of
the
lands
there
he
did
carry
on
the
design
of
the
portugall
match
so
much
to
the
prejudice
of
the
crown
of
england
notwithstanding
that
he
knew
the
queene
is
not
capable
of
bearing
children
that
the
duke
marrying
of
his
daughter
was
a
practice
of
his
thereby
to
raise
his
family
and
that
it
was
done
by
indiscreet
courses
as
to
the
of
the
match
with
parma
in
which
he
was
employed
at
the
very
time
when
the
match
with
portugall
was
made
up
here
which
he
took
as
a
great
slur
to
him
and
so
it
was
and
that
indeed
is
the
chief
occasion
of
all
this
fewde
that
he
hath
endeavoured
to
bring
in
popery
and
wrote
to
the
pope
for
a
cap
for
a
subject
of
the
king
of
england
my
lord
aubigny
brother
to
the
duke
of
lennox
and
almoner
to
the
king
and
some
say
that
he
lays
it
to
the
chancellor
that
a
good
protestant
secretary
sir
edward
nicholas
was
laid
aside
and
a
papist
sir
bennet
put
in
his
room
which
is
very
strange
when
the
last
of
these
two
is
his
own
creature
and
such
an
enemy
accounted
to
the
chancellor
that
they
never
did
nor
do
agree
and
all
the
world
did
judge
the
chancellor
to
be
falling
from
the
time
that
sir
bennet
was
brought
in
besides
my
lord
bristoll
being
a
catholique
himself
all
this
is
very
strange
these
are
the
main
of
the
articles
upon
which
my
lord
chancellor
desired
the
noble
lord
that
brought
in
these
articles
would
sign
to
them
with
his
hand
which
my
lord
bristoll
did
presently
then
the
house
did
order
that
the
judges
should
against
monday
next
bring
in
their
opinion
whether
these
articles
are
treason
or
no
and
next
they
would
know
whether
they
were
brought
in
regularly
or
no
without
leave
of
the
lords
house
by
barge
to
mary
creeke
where
commissioner
pett
doubtful
of
the
growing
greatnesse
of
portsmouth
by
the
finding
of
those
creekes
there
do
design
a
wett
docke
at
no
great
charge
and
yet
no
little
one
he
thinks
towards
and
the
place
indeed
is
likely
to
be
a
very
fit
place
when
the
king
hath
money
to
do
it
with
i
walked
to
the
temple
and
there
from
my
cousin
roger
hear
that
the
judges
have
this
day
brought
in
their
answer
to
the
lords
that
the
articles
against
my
lord
chancellor
are
not
treason
and
they
are
to
bring
in
their
arguments
to
the
house
for
the
same
this
day
also
the
king
did
send
by
my
lord
chamberlain
to
the
lords
to
tell
them
from
him
that
the
most
of
the
articles
against
my
lord
chancellor
he
himself
knows
to
be
false
i
met
the
walking
in
the
pell
mell
led
by
my
lord
alban
and
finding
many
coaches
at
the
gate
i
found
upon
enquiry
that
the
duchesse
is
brought
to
bed
of
a
boy
and
hearing
that
the
king
and
queene
are
rode
abroad
with
the
ladies
of
honour
to
the
parke
and
seeing
a
great
crowd
of
gallants
staying
here
to
see
their
return
i
also
staid
walking
up
and
down
by
and
by
the
king
and
queene
who
looked
in
this
dress
a
white
laced
waistcoate
and
a
crimson
short
pettycoate
and
her
hair
dressed
a
la
negligence
mighty
pretty
and
the
king
rode
hand
in
hand
with
her
here
was
also
my
lady
castlemaine
rode
among
the
rest
of
the
ladies
but
the
king
took
methought
no
notice
of
her
nor
when
she
light
did
any
body
press
as
she
seemed
to
expect
and
staid
for
it
to
take
her
down
but
was
taken
down
by
her
own
gentlemen
she
looked
mighty
out
of
humour
and
had
a
yellow
plume
in
her
hat
which
all
took
notice
of
and
yet
is
very
handsome
but
very
melancholy
nor
did
any
body
speak
to
her
or
she
so
much
as
smile
or
speak
to
any
body
i
followed
them
up
into
white
hall
and
into
the
presence
where
all
the
ladies
walked
talking
and
fiddling
with
their
hats
and
feathers
and
changing
and
trying
one
another
by
one
another
heads
and
laughing
but
it
was
the
finest
sight
to
me
considering
their
great
beautys
and
dress
that
ever
i
did
see
in
all
my
life
but
above
all
stewart
in
this
dresse
with
her
hat
cocked
and
a
red
plume
with
her
sweet
eye
little
roman
nose
and
excellent
taille
is
now
the
greatest
beauty
i
ever
saw
i
think
in
my
life
and
if
ever
woman
can
do
exceed
my
lady
castlemaine
at
least
in
this
dress
nor
do
i
wonder
if
the
king
changes
which
i
verily
believe
is
the
reason
of
his
coldness
to
my
lady
castlemaine
this
day
i
hear
the
judges
according
to
order
yesterday
did
bring
into
the
lords
house
their
reasons
of
their
judgments
in
the
business
between
my
lord
bristoll
and
the
chancellor
and
the
lords
do
concur
with
the
judges
that
the
articles
are
not
treason
nor
regularly
brought
into
the
house
and
so
voted
that
a
committee
should
be
chosen
to
examine
them
but
nothing
to
be
done
therein
till
the
next
sitting
of
this
parliament
which
is
likely
to
be
adjourned
in
a
day
or
two
and
in
the
mean
time
the
two
lords
to
remain
without
prejudice
done
to
either
of
them
captain
grove
come
and
dined
with
me
he
told
me
of
discourse
very
much
to
my
honour
both
as
to
my
care
and
ability
happening
at
the
duke
of
albemarle
table
the
other
day
both
from
the
duke
and
the
duchesse
themselves
and
how
i
paid
so
much
a
year
to
him
whose
place
it
was
of
right
and
that
coventry
did
report
this
of
me
this
day
the
parliament
kept
a
fast
for
the
present
unseasonable
weather
to
my
lord
crewe
my
lord
not
being
come
home
i
met
and
staid
below
with
captn
ferrers
who
was
come
to
wait
upon
my
lady
jemimah
to
james
she
being
one
of
the
four
ladies
that
hold
up
the
mantle
at
the
christening
this
afternoon
of
the
duke
child
a
boy
in
discourse
of
the
ladies
at
court
captn
ferrers
tells
me
that
my
lady
castlemaine
is
now
as
great
again
as
ever
she
was
and
that
her
going
away
was
only
a
fit
of
her
own
upon
some
slighting
words
of
the
king
so
that
she
called
for
her
coach
at
a
quarter
an
hour
warning
and
went
to
richmond
and
the
king
the
next
morning
under
pretence
of
going
went
to
see
her
and
make
friends
and
never
was
hunting
at
all
after
which
she
came
back
to
court
and
commands
the
king
as
much
as
ever
and
hath
and
doth
what
she
will
no
longer
ago
than
last
night
there
was
a
private
entertainment
made
for
the
king
and
queene
at
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
she
was
not
invited
but
being
at
my
lady
suffolk
barbara
second
wife
of
james
earl
of
suffolk
eldest
daughter
of
sir
edward
villiers
and
widow
of
sir
richard
wentworth
she
died
leaving
one
daughter
elizabeth
who
married
sir
thomas
felton
bart
her
aunt
where
my
lady
jemimah
and
lord
sandwich
dined
yesterday
she
was
heard
to
say
well
much
good
may
it
do
them
and
for
all
that
i
will
be
as
merry
as
they
and
so
she
went
home
and
caused
a
great
supper
to
be
prepared
and
after
the
king
had
been
with
the
queene
at
wallingford
house
wallingford
house
stood
on
the
site
of
the
present
admiralty
it
originally
belonged
to
the
knollys
family
and
during
the
protectorate
the
office
for
granting
passes
to
persons
going
abroad
was
kept
there
he
come
to
my
lady
castlemaine
and
was
there
all
night
and
my
lord
sandwich
with
him
he
tells
me
he
believes
that
as
soon
as
the
king
can
get
a
husband
for
stewart
however
my
lady
castlemaine
nose
will
be
out
of
joynt
for
that
she
comes
to
be
in
great
esteem
and
is
more
handsome
than
she
wotten
tells
me
the
reason
of
harris
joseph
harris
a
celebrated
actor
who
first
appeared
at
the
theatre
in
lincoln
inn
fields
he
probably
died
or
left
the
stage
about
going
from
sir
wm
house
is
that
he
grew
very
proud
and
demanded
for
himself
extraordinary
more
than
betterton
or
any
body
else
upon
every
new
play
and
upon
every
revive
which
with
other
things
sir
davenant
would
not
give
him
and
so
he
swore
he
would
never
act
there
more
in
expectation
of
being
received
in
the
other
house
but
the
king
will
not
suffer
it
upon
sir
desire
that
he
would
not
for
then
he
might
shut
up
house
and
that
is
true
we
tells
me
that
his
going
is
at
present
a
great
loss
to
the
house
and
that
he
fears
he
hath
a
stipend
from
the
other
house
privately
he
tells
me
that
the
fellow
grew
very
proud
of
late
the
king
and
every
body
else
crying
him
up
so
high
and
that
above
betterton
he
being
a
more
ayery
man
as
he
is
indeed
but
yet
betterton
he
says
they
all
say
do
act
some
parts
that
none
but
himself
can
do
i
hear
that
the
moores
have
made
some
attaques
upon
the
outworks
of
tangier
but
my
lord
teviott
with
the
loss
of
about
men
did
beat
them
of
and
killed
many
of
them
the
king
and
queene
for
certain
go
down
to
tunbridge
but
the
king
comes
back
again
against
monday
to
raise
the
parliament
having
intended
this
day
to
go
to
banstead
downes
to
see
a
famous
race
i
sent
will
to
get
himself
ready
to
go
with
me
but
i
hear
it
is
put
off
because
the
lords
do
sit
in
parliament
after
some
debate
creed
and
i
resolved
to
go
to
clapham
to
gauden
dennis
gauden
victualler
to
the
navy
subsequently
knighted
when
sheriff
of
london
when
i
come
there
the
first
thing
was
to
show
me
his
house
which
is
almost
built
i
find
it
very
regular
and
finely
contrived
and
the
gardens
and
offices
about
it
as
convenient
and
as
full
of
good
variety
as
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
it
is
true
he
hath
been
censured
for
laying
out
so
much
money
but
he
tells
me
that
he
built
it
for
his
brother
who
is
since
dead
the
bishop
of
exeter
who
when
he
should
come
to
be
bishop
of
winchester
which
he
was
promised
to
which
bishopricke
at
present
there
is
no
house
he
did
intend
to
dwell
here
by
and
by
to
dinner
and
in
comes
creed
i
saluted
his
lady
and
the
young
ladies
and
his
sister
the
bishop
widow
who
was
it
seems
sir
russel
daughter
the
treasurer
of
the
navy
who
i
find
to
be
very
and
a
woman
of
excellent
discourse
towards
the
evening
we
bade
them
adieu
and
took
horse
being
resolved
that
instead
of
the
race
which
fails
us
we
would
go
to
epsom
when
we
come
there
we
could
hear
of
no
lodging
the
town
so
full
but
which
was
better
i
went
toward
ashsted
and
there
we
got
a
lodging
in
a
little
hole
we
could
not
stand
upright
in
while
supper
was
getting
i
walked
up
and
down
behind
my
cosen
house
that
was
which
i
find
comes
little
short
of
what
i
took
it
to
be
when
i
was
a
little
boy
lord
day
up
and
to
the
wells
where
a
great
store
of
citizens
which
was
the
greatest
part
of
the
company
though
there
were
some
others
of
better
quality
thence
i
walked
to
minnes
house
and
thence
to
durdan
and
walked
within
the
court
yard
and
to
the
where
i
have
seen
so
much
mirth
in
my
time
but
now
no
family
in
it
my
lord
barkeley
whose
it
is
being
with
his
family
at
london
then
rode
through
epsom
the
whole
town
over
seeing
the
various
companys
that
were
there
walking
which
was
very
pleasant
to
see
how
they
are
there
without
knowing
what
to
do
but
only
in
the
morning
to
drink
waters
but
lord
to
see
how
many
i
met
there
of
citizens
that
i
could
not
have
thought
to
have
seen
there
that
they
had
ever
had
it
in
their
heads
or
purses
to
go
down
thither
we
went
through
nonesuch
parke
to
the
house
and
there
viewed
as
much
as
we
could
of
the
outside
and
looked
through
the
great
gates
and
found
a
noble
court
and
altogether
believe
it
to
have
been
a
very
noble
house
and
a
delicate
parke
about
it
where
just
now
there
was
a
doe
killed
for
the
king
to
carry
up
to
court
we
rode
hard
home
and
see
up
our
horses
at
fox
hall
and
i
by
water
observing
the
king
barge
attending
his
going
to
the
house
this
day
home
it
being
about
one
by
water
to
westminster
and
there
come
most
luckily
to
the
lords
house
as
the
house
of
commons
were
going
into
the
lords
house
and
there
i
crowded
in
along
with
the
speaker
and
got
to
stand
close
behind
him
where
he
made
his
speech
to
the
king
who
sat
with
his
crown
on
and
robes
and
so
all
the
lords
in
their
robes
a
fine
sight
wherein
he
told
his
majesty
what
they
have
done
this
parliament
and
now
offered
for
his
royall
consent
the
greatest
matters
were
a
bill
for
the
lord
day
which
it
seems
the
lords
have
lost
and
so
can
not
be
passed
at
which
the
commons
are
displeased
the
bills
against
conventicles
and
papists
but
it
seems
the
lords
have
not
passed
them
and
giving
his
majesty
four
entire
subsidys
which
last
with
about
twenty
smaller
acts
were
passed
with
this
form
the
clerk
of
the
house
reads
the
title
of
the
bill
and
then
looks
at
the
end
and
there
finds
writ
by
the
king
i
suppose
le
roy
le
veult
and
that
he
reads
and
to
others
he
reads
soit
fait
comme
vous
desirez
and
to
the
subsidys
as
well
that
for
the
commons
i
mean
the
layety
as
for
the
clergy
the
king
writes
le
roy
remerciant
les
seigneurs
et
prelats
et
accepte
leur
benevolences
the
speaker
speech
was
far
from
any
oratory
but
was
as
plain
though
good
matter
as
any
thing
could
be
and
void
of
elocution
after
the
bills
passed
the
king
sitting
on
his
throne
with
his
speech
writ
in
a
paper
which
he
held
in
his
lap
and
scarce
looked
off
of
it
all
the
time
he
made
his
speech
to
them
giving
them
thanks
for
their
subsidys
of
which
had
he
not
need
he
would
not
have
asked
or
received
them
and
that
need
not
from
any
extravagancys
of
his
he
was
sure
in
any
thing
but
the
disorders
of
the
times
compelling
him
to
be
at
greater
charge
than
he
hoped
for
the
future
by
their
care
in
their
country
he
should
be
and
that
for
his
family
expenses
and
others
he
would
labour
however
to
retrench
in
many
things
convenient
and
would
have
all
others
to
do
so
too
he
desired
that
nothing
of
old
faults
should
be
remembered
or
severity
for
the
same
used
to
any
in
the
country
it
being
his
desire
to
have
all
forgot
as
well
as
forgiven
but
however
to
use
all
care
in
suppressing
any
tumults
assuring
them
that
the
restless
spirits
of
his
and
their
adversaries
have
great
expectations
of
something
to
be
done
this
summer
and
promised
that
though
the
acts
about
conventicles
and
papists
were
not
ripe
for
passing
this
sessions
yet
he
would
take
care
himself
that
neither
of
them
should
in
this
intervall
be
encouraged
to
the
endangering
of
the
peace
and
that
at
their
next
meeting
he
would
himself
prepare
two
bills
for
them
concerning
them
so
he
concluded
that
for
the
better
proceeding
of
justice
he
did
think
fit
to
make
this
a
sessions
and
to
prorogue
them
to
the
of
march
next
his
speech
was
very
plain
nothing
at
all
of
spirit
in
it
nor
spoke
with
any
but
rather
on
the
contrary
imperfectly
repeating
many
times
his
words
though
he
read
all
which
i
am
sorry
to
see
it
having
not
been
hard
for
him
to
have
got
all
the
speech
without
booke
so
they
all
went
away
the
king
out
of
the
house
at
the
upper
end
he
being
by
and
by
to
go
to
tunbridge
to
the
queene
and
i
in
the
painted
chamber
spoke
with
my
lord
sandwich
while
he
was
putting
off
his
robes
who
tells
me
he
will
now
hasten
down
into
the
country
by
water
to
white
hall
and
walked
over
the
parke
to
james
but
missed
coventry
and
so
out
again
and
there
the
duke
was
coming
along
the
it
being
a
little
darkish
i
staid
not
to
take
notice
of
him
but
went
directly
back
again
and
in
our
walk
over
the
parke
one
of
the
duke
footmen
come
running
behind
us
and
come
looking
just
in
our
faces
to
see
who
we
were
and
went
back
again
what
his
meaning
is
i
know
not
but
was
fearful
that
i
might
not
go
far
enough
with
my
hat
off
to
deptford
reading
by
the
way
a
most
ridiculous
play
a
new
one
called
the
politician
cheated
a
comedy
by
alexander
green
to
woolwich
and
there
come
sir
carteret
and
then
by
water
back
to
deptford
where
we
dined
with
him
at
his
house
i
find
his
little
daughter
betty
her
name
was
caroline
elizabeth
died
unmarried
that
was
in
hanging
sleeves
but
a
month
or
two
ago
and
is
a
very
little
young
child
married
and
to
whom
but
to
young
scott
thomas
eldest
son
of
sir
thomas
scott
of
scott
hall
in
the
parish
of
smeeth
kent
son
to
madam
catharine
scott
prince
rupert
was
supposed
to
have
intrigued
with
scott
and
was
probably
the
father
of
the
child
that
was
so
long
in
law
and
at
whose
trial
i
was
with
her
husband
he
pleading
that
it
was
unlawfully
got
and
would
not
own
it
but
it
seems
a
little
before
his
death
he
did
owne
the
child
and
hath
left
him
his
estate
not
long
since
so
sir
carteret
hath
struck
up
of
a
sudden
a
match
with
him
for
his
little
daughter
he
hath
about
per
annum
and
it
seems
sir
hath
by
this
means
sir
bennet
who
did
endeavour
to
get
this
gentleman
for
a
sister
of
his
by
this
means
sir
carteret
hath
married
two
daughters
this
year
both
very
well
the
other
daughter
was
anne
wife
of
sir
nicholas
slaning
the
towne
talk
this
day
is
of
nothing
but
the
great
run
this
day
on
banstead
downes
between
lee
the
duke
of
richmond
footman
and
a
tyler
a
famous
runner
and
lee
hath
beat
him
though
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
all
men
almost
did
bet
three
or
four
to
one
upon
the
tyler
head
to
the
exchange
where
i
met
pierce
who
tells
me
of
his
good
luck
to
get
to
be
groom
of
the
to
the
queene
and
without
my
lord
sandwich
help
but
only
by
his
good
fortune
meeting
a
man
that
hath
let
him
have
his
right
for
a
small
matter
about
for
which
he
can
every
day
have
but
he
tells
me
my
lord
bath
lost
much
honour
in
standing
so
long
and
so
much
for
that
coxcomb
pickering
and
at
last
not
carrying
it
for
him
but
hath
his
name
struck
out
by
the
king
and
queene
themselves
after
he
had
been
in
ever
since
the
queene
coming
but
he
tells
me
he
believes
that
either
sir
bennet
my
lady
castlemaine
or
sir
charles
barkeley
had
received
some
money
for
the
place
and
so
the
king
could
not
disappoint
them
but
was
forced
to
put
out
this
fool
rather
than
a
better
man
and
i
am
sorry
to
hear
what
he
tells
me
that
sir
charles
barkeley
hath
still
such
power
over
the
king
as
to
be
able
to
fetch
him
from
the
to
my
lady
castlemaine
when
he
pleases
he
tells
me
also
as
a
friend
the
great
injury
that
he
thinks
i
do
myself
by
being
so
severe
in
the
yards
and
contracting
the
will
of
the
whole
navy
for
those
offices
singly
upon
myself
now
i
discharge
a
good
conscience
therein
and
i
tell
him
that
no
man
can
nor
do
he
say
any
say
it
charge
me
with
doing
wrong
but
rather
do
as
many
good
offices
as
any
man
they
think
he
says
that
i
have
a
mind
to
get
a
good
name
with
the
king
and
duke
who
he
tells
me
do
not
consider
any
such
thing
but
i
shall
have
as
good
thanks
to
let
all
alone
and
do
as
the
rest
but
i
believe
the
contrary
and
yet
i
told
him
i
never
go
to
the
duke
alone
as
others
do
to
talk
of
my
own
services
however
i
will
make
use
of
his
council
and
take
some
course
to
prevent
having
the
single
of
the
office
grant
showed
me
letters
of
sir
william
petty
wherein
he
says
that
his
vessel
which
he
hath
built
upon
two
keeles
a
modell
whereof
built
for
the
king
he
showed
me
hath
this
month
won
a
wager
of
in
sailing
between
dublin
and
holyhead
with
the
the
best
ship
or
vessel
the
king
hath
there
and
he
offers
to
lay
with
any
vessel
in
the
world
it
is
about
thirty
ton
in
burden
and
carries
thirty
men
with
good
accommodation
as
much
more
as
any
ship
of
her
burden
and
so
any
vessel
of
this
figure
shall
carry
more
men
with
better
accommodation
by
half
than
any
other
ship
this
carries
also
ten
guns
of
about
five
tons
weight
in
their
coming
back
from
holyhead
they
started
together
and
this
vessel
come
to
dublin
by
five
at
night
and
the
not
before
eight
the
next
morning
and
when
they
come
they
did
believe
that
this
vessel
had
been
drowned
or
at
least
behind
not
thinking
she
could
have
lived
in
that
sea
strange
things
are
told
of
this
vessel
and
he
concludes
his
letter
with
this
position
i
only
affirm
that
the
perfection
of
sayling
lies
in
my
principle
finde
it
out
who
can
august
i
with
coventry
down
to
the
talking
wherein
i
see
so
much
goodness
and
endeavours
of
doing
the
king
service
that
i
do
more
and
more
admire
him
to
church
and
heard
mills
who
is
lately
returned
out
of
the
country
and
it
seems
was
fetched
in
by
many
of
the
parishioners
with
great
state
preach
upon
the
authority
of
the
ministers
upon
these
words
we
are
therefore
embassadors
of
christ
wherein
among
other
high
expressions
he
said
that
such
a
learned
man
used
to
say
that
if
a
minister
of
the
word
and
an
angell
should
meet
him
together
he
would
salute
the
minister
first
which
methought
was
a
little
too
high
this
day
i
begun
to
make
use
of
the
silver
pen
coventry
did
give
me
in
writing
of
this
sermon
taking
only
the
heads
of
it
in
latin
which
i
shall
i
think
continue
to
do
to
the
committee
of
tangier
where
my
lord
sandwich
my
lord
peterborough
whom
i
have
not
seen
before
since
his
coming
back
sir
compton
and
povy
our
discourse
about
supplying
my
lord
teviott
with
money
wherein
i
am
sorry
to
see
though
they
do
not
care
for
him
yet
they
are
willing
to
let
him
for
civility
and
compliment
only
have
money
also
without
expecting
any
account
of
it
and
he
being
such
a
cunning
fellow
as
he
is
the
king
is
like
to
pay
dear
for
our
ceremony
thence
by
coach
with
my
lords
peterborough
and
sandwich
to
my
lord
peterborough
house
and
there
after
an
hour
looking
over
some
fine
books
of
the
italian
buildings
with
fine
cuts
and
also
my
lord
peterborough
bowes
and
arrows
of
which
he
is
a
great
lover
we
sat
down
to
dinner
my
lady
penelope
daughter
of
barnabas
earl
of
thomond
countess
of
peterborough
coming
down
to
dinner
also
and
there
being
williamson
joseph
williamson
keeper
of
the
paper
office
at
white
hall
and
in
made
under
secretary
of
state
and
soon
afterwards
knighted
and
in
he
became
secretary
of
state
which
situation
he
retained
four
years
he
represented
thetford
and
rochester
in
several
parliaments
and
was
in
president
of
the
royal
society
ob
that
belongs
to
sir
bennet
whom
i
find
a
pretty
understanding
and
accomplished
man
but
a
little
conceited
yesterday
i
am
told
that
sir
lenthall
son
to
the
speaker
and
governor
of
windsor
castle
under
cromwell
ob
in
southwarke
did
apprehend
about
one
hundred
quakers
and
other
such
people
and
hath
sent
some
of
them
to
the
gaole
at
kingston
it
being
now
the
time
of
the
assizes
pierce
tells
me
the
queene
is
grown
a
very
debonnaire
lady
but
my
lady
castlemaine
who
rules
the
king
in
matters
of
state
and
do
what
she
list
with
him
he
believes
is
now
falling
quite
out
of
favour
after
the
queene
is
come
back
she
goes
to
the
bath
and
so
to
oxford
where
great
entertainments
are
making
for
her
this
day
i
am
told
that
my
lord
bristoll
hath
warrants
issued
out
against
him
to
have
carried
him
to
the
tower
but
he
is
fled
away
or
hid
himself
so
much
the
chancellor
hath
got
the
better
of
him
met
with
hoole
william
son
of
robert
hoole
of
walkeringham
admitted
of
magdalene
college
june
my
old
acquaintance
of
magdalene
and
walked
with
him
an
hour
in
the
parke
discoursing
chiefly
of
sir
samuel
morland
whose
lady
susanne
de
milleville
daughter
of
daniel
de
milleville
baron
of
boessen
in
france
naturalized
when
she
died
i
can
not
learn
but
sir
samuel
morland
survived
a
second
and
a
third
wife
both
buried
in
westminster
abbey
is
gone
into
france
it
seems
he
buys
ground
and
a
farm
in
that
country
and
lays
out
money
upon
building
and
god
knows
what
so
that
most
of
the
money
he
sold
his
pension
of
per
annum
for
to
sir
arthur
slingsby
a
younger
son
of
sir
guildford
slingsby
comptroller
of
the
navy
knighted
by
charles
and
afterwards
created
a
baronet
at
brussels
which
title
has
long
been
extinct
is
believed
is
gone
it
seems
he
hath
very
great
promises
from
the
king
and
boole
hath
seen
some
of
the
king
letters
under
his
own
hand
to
morland
promising
him
great
things
and
among
others
the
order
of
the
garter
as
sir
samuel
says
but
his
lady
thought
it
below
her
to
ask
any
thing
at
the
king
first
coming
believing
the
king
would
do
it
of
himself
when
as
hoole
do
really
think
if
he
had
asked
to
be
secretary
of
state
at
the
king
first
coming
he
might
have
had
it
and
the
other
day
at
her
going
into
france
she
did
speak
largely
to
the
king
herself
how
her
husband
hath
failed
of
what
his
majesty
had
promised
and
she
was
sure
intended
him
and
the
king
did
promise
still
as
he
is
a
king
and
a
gentleman
to
be
as
good
as
his
word
in
a
little
time
to
a
tittle
but
i
never
believe
it
meeting
with
creed
he
told
me
how
my
lord
teviott
hath
received
another
attacque
from
guyland
at
tangier
with
men
and
at
last
as
is
said
is
come
after
a
personal
treaty
with
him
to
a
good
understanding
and
peace
with
him
to
church
and
so
home
to
my
wife
and
with
her
read
iter
boreale
robert
wild
a
nonconformist
divine
published
a
poem
in
upon
monk
march
from
scotland
to
london
called
iter
boreale
and
wood
mentions
three
others
of
the
same
name
by
eades
corbett
and
marten
it
having
been
a
favourite
subject
at
that
time
a
poem
made
first
at
the
king
coming
home
but
i
never
read
it
before
and
now
like
it
pretty
well
but
not
so
as
it
was
cried
up
at
my
lord
sandwich
where
i
was
a
good
while
alone
with
my
lord
and
i
perceive
he
confides
in
me
and
loves
me
as
he
uses
to
do
and
tells
me
his
condition
which
is
now
very
well
all
i
fear
is
that
he
will
not
live
within
compass
there
come
to
him
this
morning
his
prints
of
the
river
tagus
and
the
city
of
lisbon
which
he
measured
with
his
own
hand
and
printed
by
command
of
the
king
my
lord
pleases
himself
with
it
but
methinks
it
ought
to
have
been
better
done
than
by
jobing
besides
i
put
him
upon
having
some
took
off
upon
white
sattin
which
he
ordered
presently
i
offered
my
lord
my
accounts
and
did
give
him
up
his
old
bond
for
and
took
a
new
one
of
him
for
which
i
am
by
lending
him
more
money
to
make
up
and
am
glad
of
it
this
noon
going
to
the
exchange
i
met
a
fine
fellow
with
trumpets
before
him
in
and
upon
enquiry
i
find
that
he
is
the
clerke
of
the
city
market
and
three
or
four
men
carried
each
of
them
an
arrow
of
a
pound
weight
in
their
hands
it
seems
this
lord
mayor
sir
john
frederic
begins
again
an
old
custome
that
upon
the
three
first
days
of
bartholomew
fayre
the
first
there
is
a
match
of
wrestling
which
was
done
and
the
lord
mayor
there
and
the
aldermen
in
moorefields
yesterday
second
day
shooting
and
hunting
and
this
officer
of
course
is
to
perform
this
ceremony
of
riding
through
the
city
i
think
to
proclaim
or
challenge
any
to
shoot
it
seems
the
people
of
the
faire
cry
out
upon
it
as
a
great
hindrance
to
them
to
white
hall
where
the
court
full
of
waggons
and
horses
the
king
and
court
going
this
day
out
towards
the
bath
pleased
to
see
captn
hickes
come
to
me
with
a
list
of
all
the
officers
of
deptford
yard
wherein
he
being
a
high
old
cavalier
do
give
me
an
account
of
every
one
of
them
to
their
reproach
in
all
respects
and
discovers
many
of
their
knaverys
and
tells
me
and
so
i
thank
god
i
hear
every
where
that
my
name
is
up
for
a
good
husband
to
the
king
and
a
good
man
for
which
i
bless
god
and
that
he
did
this
by
particular
direction
of
coventry
cold
all
night
and
this
morning
and
a
very
great
frost
they
say
abroad
which
is
much
having
had
no
summer
at
all
almost
september
to
dinner
with
my
lord
mayor
and
the
aldermen
and
a
very
great
dinner
and
most
excellent
venison
but
it
almost
made
me
sick
by
not
daring
to
drink
wine
after
dinner
into
a
withdrawing
room
and
there
we
talked
among
other
things
of
the
lord
mayor
sword
they
tell
me
this
sword
is
at
least
a
hundred
or
two
hundred
years
old
and
another
that
he
hath
which
is
called
the
black
sword
which
the
lord
mayor
wears
when
he
mournes
but
properly
is
their
lenten
sword
to
wear
upon
good
friday
and
other
lent
days
is
older
than
that
lewellin
lately
come
from
ireland
tells
me
how
the
english
interest
falls
mightily
there
the
irish
party
being
too
great
so
that
most
of
the
old
rebells
are
found
innocent
and
their
lands
which
were
forfeited
and
bought
or
given
to
the
english
are
restored
to
them
which
gives
great
discontent
there
among
the
english
going
through
the
city
my
lord
mayor
told
me
how
the
piller
set
up
by
exeter
house
is
only
to
show
where
the
pipes
of
water
run
to
the
city
and
observed
that
this
city
is
as
well
watered
as
any
city
in
the
world
and
that
the
bringing
of
water
to
the
city
hath
cost
it
first
and
last
above
but
by
the
new
building
and
the
building
of
james
by
my
lord
albans
which
is
now
about
and
which
the
city
stomach
i
perceive
highly
but
dare
not
oppose
it
were
it
now
to
be
done
it
would
not
be
done
for
a
million
of
money
to
westminster
hall
and
there
bought
the
first
news
books
of
writing
he
beginning
this
week
and
makes
methinks
but
a
simple
beginning
roger
author
of
numerous
pamphlets
and
periodical
papers
he
was
licenser
of
the
press
to
charles
ii
and
his
successor
and
for
winchester
in
james
ii
parliament
ob
aged
this
day
i
read
a
proclamation
for
calling
in
and
commanding
every
body
to
apprehend
my
lord
bristoll
i
did
inform
myself
well
in
things
relating
to
the
east
indys
both
of
the
country
and
the
disappointment
the
king
met
with
the
last
voyage
by
the
knavery
of
the
portugall
viceroy
and
the
inconsiderableness
of
the
place
of
bombaim
bombay
if
we
had
had
it
but
above
all
things
it
seems
strange
to
me
that
matters
should
not
be
understood
before
they
went
out
and
also
that
such
a
thing
as
this
which
was
expected
to
be
one
of
the
best
parts
of
the
queene
portion
should
not
be
better
understood
it
being
if
we
had
it
but
a
poor
place
and
not
really
so
as
was
described
to
our
king
in
the
draught
of
it
but
a
poor
little
island
whereas
they
made
the
king
and
lord
chancellor
and
other
learned
men
about
the
king
believe
that
that
and
other
islands
which
are
near
it
were
all
one
piece
and
so
the
draught
was
drawn
and
presented
to
the
king
and
believed
by
the
king
and
expected
to
prove
so
when
our
men
come
thither
but
it
is
quite
otherwise
up
betimes
and
by
water
to
white
hall
and
thence
to
sir
philip
warwick
and
there
had
half
an
hour
private
discourse
with
him
and
did
give
him
some
good
satisfaction
in
our
navy
matters
and
he
also
me
as
to
the
money
paid
and
due
to
the
navy
so
as
he
makes
me
assured
by
particulars
that
sir
carteret
is
paid
within
every
farthing
that
we
owe
to
this
day
nay
to
michaelmas
day
next
have
demanded
and
that
i
am
sure
is
above
more
than
truly
our
expences
have
been
whatever
is
become
of
the
money
home
with
great
content
that
i
have
thus
begun
an
acquaintance
with
him
who
is
a
great
man
and
a
man
of
as
much
business
as
any
man
in
england
which
i
will
endeavour
to
deserve
and
keep
this
day
the
king
and
queene
are
to
come
to
oxford
i
hear
my
lady
castlemaine
is
for
certain
gone
to
oxford
to
meet
him
having
lain
within
here
at
home
this
week
or
two
supposed
to
have
miscarried
but
for
certain
is
as
great
in
favour
as
heretofore
at
least
sarah
at
my
lord
who
hears
all
from
their
own
family
do
say
so
every
day
brings
news
of
the
turke
advance
into
germany
to
the
awakening
of
all
the
christian
princes
thereabouts
and
possessing
himself
of
hungary
i
went
forth
by
water
to
sir
philip
warwick
where
i
was
with
him
a
pretty
while
and
in
discourse
he
tells
me
and
made
it
appear
to
me
that
the
king
can
not
be
in
debt
to
the
navy
at
this
time
and
it
is
my
opinion
that
sir
carteret
do
owe
the
king
money
and
yet
the
whole
navy
debt
paid
hence
i
parted
being
doubtful
of
myself
that
i
have
not
spoke
with
the
gravity
and
weight
that
i
ought
to
do
in
so
great
a
business
but
i
rather
hope
it
is
my
doubtfulness
of
myself
and
the
haste
which
he
was
in
some
very
great
personages
waiting
for
him
without
while
he
was
with
me
that
made
him
willing
to
be
gone
to
white
hall
where
sir
minnes
and
i
did
spend
an
hour
in
the
gallery
looking
upon
the
pictures
in
which
he
hath
some
judgement
and
by
and
by
the
commissioners
for
tangier
met
and
there
my
lord
teviott
together
with
captain
cuttance
captain
evans
and
jonas
moore
sent
to
that
purpose
did
bring
us
a
brave
draught
of
the
mole
to
be
built
there
and
report
that
it
is
likely
to
be
the
most
considerable
place
the
king
of
england
hath
in
the
world
and
so
i
am
apt
to
think
it
will
after
discourse
of
this
and
of
supplying
the
garrison
with
some
more
horse
we
rose
and
sir
minnes
and
i
home
again
finding
the
street
about
our
house
full
sir
ford
beginning
his
shrievalty
and
what
with
his
and
our
houses
being
new
painted
the
street
begins
to
look
a
great
deal
better
than
it
did
and
more
gracefull
news
that
the
king
comes
to
town
for
certain
on
thursday
next
from
his
great
progress
in
the
afternoon
by
water
to
white
hall
to
the
tangier
committee
where
my
lord
teviott
which
grieves
me
to
see
that
his
accounts
being
to
be
examined
by
us
there
are
none
of
the
great
men
at
the
board
that
in
compliment
will
except
against
any
thing
in
them
and
so
none
of
the
little
persons
dare
do
it
so
the
king
is
abused
october
my
lord
sandwich
sent
a
messenger
to
know
whether
the
king
intends
to
come
to
newmarket
as
is
talked
that
he
may
be
ready
to
entertain
him
at
hinchingbroke
at
james
we
attended
the
duke
all
of
us
and
there
after
my
discourse
coventry
of
his
own
accord
begun
to
tell
the
duke
how
he
found
that
discourse
abroad
did
run
to
his
prejudice
about
the
fees
that
he
took
and
how
he
sold
places
and
other
things
wherein
he
desired
to
appeal
to
his
highness
whether
he
did
any
thing
more
than
what
his
predecessors
did
and
appealed
to
us
all
so
sir
carteret
did
answer
that
some
fees
were
heretofore
taken
but
what
he
knows
not
only
that
selling
of
places
never
was
nor
ought
to
be
countenanced
so
coventry
very
hotly
answered
to
sir
carteret
and
appealed
to
himself
whether
he
was
not
one
of
the
first
that
put
him
upon
looking
after
this
business
of
fees
and
that
he
told
him
that
smith
should
say
that
he
made
the
first
year
and
he
believed
he
made
this
sir
carteret
denied
and
said
that
if
he
did
say
so
he
told
a
lie
for
he
could
not
nor
did
know
that
ever
he
did
make
that
profit
of
his
place
but
that
he
believes
he
might
say
the
first
year
coventry
instanced
in
another
thing
particularly
wherein
sir
carteret
did
advise
with
him
about
the
selling
of
the
auditor
place
of
the
stores
when
in
the
beginning
there
was
an
intention
of
creating
such
an
office
this
he
confessed
but
with
some
lessening
of
the
tale
coventry
told
it
being
only
for
a
respect
to
my
lord
fitzharding
sir
charles
berkeley
mentioned
before
created
lord
berkeley
of
rathdown
and
viscount
fitzharding
in
ireland
second
son
to
sir
charles
berkeley
of
bruton
somerset
afterwards
made
an
english
peer
by
the
titles
of
lord
botetourt
and
earl
of
falmouth
and
killed
in
the
great
june
in
fine
coventry
did
put
into
the
duke
hand
a
list
of
above
places
that
he
did
give
without
receiving
one
farthing
so
much
as
his
ordinary
fees
for
them
upon
his
life
and
oath
and
that
since
the
establishment
of
fees
he
had
never
received
one
token
more
of
any
man
and
that
in
his
whole
life
he
never
conditioned
or
discoursed
of
any
consideration
from
any
commanders
since
he
come
to
the
navy
and
afterwards
my
lord
barkeley
merrily
discoursing
that
he
wished
his
profit
greater
than
it
was
and
that
he
did
believe
that
he
had
got
since
he
come
in
coventry
did
openly
declare
that
his
lordship
or
any
of
us
should
have
not
only
all
he
had
got
but
all
that
he
had
in
the
world
and
yet
he
did
not
come
a
beggar
into
the
navy
nor
would
yet
he
thought
to
speak
in
any
contempt
of
his
royall
bounty
and
should
have
a
year
to
consider
of
it
too
for
the
duke
answer
was
that
he
wished
we
all
had
made
more
profit
than
we
had
of
our
places
and
that
we
had
all
of
us
got
as
much
as
one
man
below
stayres
in
the
court
which
he
presently
named
and
it
was
sir
george
lane
one
of
the
clerks
of
the
privy
council
and
secretary
to
the
marquis
of
ormond
i
find
at
court
that
either
the
king
is
doubtful
of
some
disturbance
or
else
would
seem
so
and
i
have
reason
to
hope
it
is
no
worse
by
his
commanding
little
commanders
of
castles
to
repair
to
their
charges
and
mustering
the
guards
the
other
day
himself
where
he
found
reason
to
dislike
their
condition
to
my
lord
gerard
finding
so
many
absent
men
or
dead
pays
my
lady
castlemaine
i
hear
is
in
as
great
favour
as
ever
and
the
king
supped
with
her
the
very
first
night
he
come
from
bath
and
last
night
and
the
night
before
supped
with
her
when
there
being
a
chine
of
beef
to
roast
and
the
tide
rising
into
their
kitchen
that
it
could
not
be
roasted
there
and
the
cook
telling
her
of
it
she
answered
zounds
she
must
set
the
house
on
fire
but
it
should
be
roasted
so
it
was
carried
to
sarah
husband
and
there
it
was
roasted
after
dinner
my
wife
and
i
by
rawlinson
conduct
to
the
jewish
synagogue
where
the
men
and
boys
in
their
vayles
and
the
women
behind
a
lettice
out
of
sight
and
some
things
stand
up
which
i
believe
is
their
law
in
a
press
to
which
all
coming
in
do
bow
and
at
the
putting
on
their
vayles
do
say
something
to
which
others
that
hear
the
priest
do
cry
amen
and
the
party
do
kiss
his
vayle
their
service
all
in
a
singing
way
and
in
hebrew
and
anon
their
laws
that
they
take
out
of
the
press
are
carried
by
several
men
four
or
five
several
burthens
in
all
and
they
do
relieve
one
another
and
whether
it
is
that
every
one
desires
to
have
the
carrying
of
it
thus
they
carried
it
round
about
the
room
while
such
a
service
is
singing
and
in
the
end
they
had
a
prayer
for
the
king
in
which
they
pronounced
his
name
in
portugall
but
the
prayer
like
the
rest
in
hebrew
but
lord
to
see
the
disorder
laughing
sporting
and
no
attention
but
confusion
in
all
their
service
more
like
brutes
than
people
knowing
the
true
god
would
make
a
man
forswear
ever
seeing
them
more
and
indeed
i
never
did
see
so
much
or
could
have
imagined
there
had
been
any
religion
in
the
whole
world
so
absurdly
performed
as
this
some
discourse
of
the
queene
being
very
sick
if
not
dead
the
duke
and
duchesse
of
york
being
sent
for
betimes
this
morning
to
come
to
white
hall
to
her
the
parson
mills
i
perceive
did
not
know
whether
to
pray
for
the
queene
or
no
and
so
said
nothing
about
her
which
makes
me
fear
she
is
dead
but
enquiring
of
sir
minnes
he
told
me
that
he
heard
she
was
better
last
night
waked
with
a
very
high
wind
and
said
to
my
wife
i
pray
god
i
hear
not
of
the
death
of
any
great
person
this
wind
is
so
high
fearing
that
the
queene
might
be
dead
so
up
and
going
by
coach
with
sir
batten
and
sir
minnes
to
james
they
tell
me
that
sir
compton
who
it
is
true
had
been
a
little
sickly
for
a
week
or
fortnight
but
was
very
well
upon
friday
at
night
last
at
the
tangier
committee
with
us
was
dead
died
yesterday
at
which
i
was
most
exceedingly
surprised
he
being
and
so
all
the
world
saying
that
he
was
one
of
the
worthyest
men
and
best
officers
of
state
now
in
england
and
so
in
my
conscience
he
was
of
the
best
temper
valour
ability
of
mind
integrity
worth
fine
person
and
diligence
of
any
one
man
he
hath
left
behind
him
in
the
three
kingdoms
and
yet
not
forty
years
old
or
if
so
that
is
all
i
find
the
sober
men
of
the
court
troubled
for
him
and
yet
not
so
as
to
hinder
or
lessen
their
mirth
talking
laughing
and
eating
drinking
and
doing
every
thing
else
just
as
if
there
was
no
such
thing
coming
to
james
i
hear
that
the
queene
did
sleep
five
hours
pretty
well
and
that
she
waked
and
gargled
her
mouth
and
to
sleep
again
but
that
her
pulse
beats
fast
beating
twenty
to
the
king
or
my
lady
suffolk
eleven
but
not
so
strong
as
it
was
it
seems
she
was
so
ill
as
to
be
shaved
and
pidgeons
put
to
her
feet
and
to
have
the
extreme
unction
given
her
by
the
priests
who
were
so
long
about
it
that
the
doctors
were
angry
the
king
they
all
say
is
most
fondly
disconsolate
for
her
and
weeps
by
her
which
makes
her
weep
which
one
this
day
told
me
he
reckons
a
good
sign
for
that
it
carries
away
some
rheume
from
the
head
to
the
in
cornhill
where
much
talk
about
the
turke
proceedings
and
that
the
plague
is
got
to
amsterdam
brought
by
a
ship
from
argier
and
it
is
also
carried
to
hambrough
the
duke
says
the
king
purposes
to
forbid
any
of
their
ships
coming
into
the
river
the
duke
also
told
us
of
several
christian
commanders
french
gone
over
to
the
turkes
to
serve
them
and
upon
enquiry
i
find
that
the
king
of
france
do
by
this
aspire
to
the
empire
and
so
to
get
the
crowne
of
spayne
also
upon
the
death
of
the
king
which
is
very
probable
it
seems
this
evening
at
my
lord
lodgings
sarah
talking
with
my
wife
and
i
how
the
queene
do
and
how
the
king
tends
her
being
so
she
tells
that
the
queene
sickness
is
the
spotted
fever
that
she
was
as
full
of
the
spots
as
a
leopard
which
is
very
strange
that
it
should
be
no
more
known
but
perhaps
it
is
not
so
and
that
the
king
do
seem
to
take
it
much
to
heart
for
that
he
hath
wept
before
her
but
for
all
that
that
he
hath
not
missed
one
night
since
she
was
sick
of
supping
with
my
lady
castlemaine
which
i
believe
is
true
for
she
says
that
her
husband
hath
dressed
the
suppers
every
night
and
i
confess
i
saw
him
myself
coming
through
the
street
dressing
up
a
great
supper
which
sarah
says
is
also
for
the
king
and
her
which
is
a
very
strange
thing
this
morning
hearing
that
the
queene
grows
worse
again
i
sent
to
stop
the
making
of
my
velvet
cloak
till
i
see
whether
she
lives
or
dies
the
queene
slept
pretty
well
last
night
but
her
fever
continues
upon
her
still
it
seems
she
hath
never
a
portuguese
doctor
here
the
queene
is
in
a
good
way
of
recovery
and
sir
francis
pridgeon
vertue
according
to
walpole
had
seen
a
portrait
of
prujeon
painted
by
streater
and
a
print
of
opinion
sitting
on
a
tree
thus
inscribed
viro
clariss
dno
francisco
prujeano
medico
omnium
bonarum
artium
et
elegantiarum
fautori
et
admiratori
summo
peacham
he
was
president
of
the
college
of
physicians
hath
got
great
honour
by
it
it
being
all
imputed
to
his
cordiall
which
in
her
dispaire
did
give
her
rest
and
brought
her
to
some
hopes
of
recovery
it
seems
that
after
much
talk
of
troubles
and
a
plot
something
is
found
in
the
north
that
a
party
was
to
rise
and
some
persons
that
were
to
command
it
as
i
find
in
a
letter
that
coventry
read
day
about
it
from
those
parts
pierce
tells
me
that
the
queene
is
in
a
way
to
be
pretty
well
again
but
that
her
delirium
in
her
head
continues
still
that
she
talks
idle
not
by
fits
but
always
which
in
some
lasts
a
week
after
so
high
a
fever
in
some
more
and
in
some
for
ever
that
this
morning
she
talked
mightily
that
she
was
brought
to
bed
and
that
she
wondered
that
she
should
be
delivered
without
pin
and
without
being
sick
and
that
she
was
troubled
that
her
boy
was
but
an
ugly
boy
but
the
king
being
by
said
no
it
is
a
very
pretty
boy
nay
says
she
if
it
be
like
you
it
is
a
fine
boy
indeed
and
i
would
be
very
well
pleased
with
it
they
say
that
the
turkes
go
on
apace
and
that
my
lord
castlehaven
the
eldest
son
of
the
infamous
earl
of
castlehaven
had
a
new
creation
to
his
father
forfeited
titles
in
and
died
he
had
served
with
distinction
under
the
duke
of
ormond
and
afterwards
joined
charles
ii
at
paris
is
going
to
raise
men
here
for
to
go
against
him
that
the
king
of
france
do
offer
to
assist
the
empire
upon
condition
that
he
may
be
their
generalissimo
and
the
dolphin
chosen
king
of
the
romans
and
it
is
said
that
the
king
of
france
do
occasion
this
difference
among
the
christian
princes
of
the
empire
which
gives
the
turke
such
advantages
they
say
also
that
the
king
of
spayne
is
making
all
imaginable
force
against
portugall
again
coventry
tells
me
that
the
queene
had
a
very
good
night
last
night
but
yet
it
is
strange
that
still
she
raves
and
talks
of
little
more
than
of
her
having
of
children
and
fancys
now
that
she
hath
three
children
and
that
the
girle
is
very
like
the
king
and
this
morning
about
five
the
physician
feeling
her
pulse
thinking
to
be
better
able
to
judge
she
being
still
and
asleep
waked
her
and
the
first
word
she
said
was
how
do
the
children
to
guild
hall
and
meeting
with
proby
sir
son
and
baron
a
city
commander
we
went
up
and
down
to
see
the
tables
where
under
every
salt
there
was
a
bill
of
fare
and
at
the
end
of
the
table
the
persons
proper
for
the
table
many
were
the
tables
but
none
in
the
hall
but
the
mayor
and
the
lords
of
the
privy
council
that
had
napkins
or
knives
which
was
very
strange
we
went
into
the
buttry
and
there
stayed
and
talked
and
then
into
the
hall
again
and
there
wine
was
offered
and
they
drunk
i
only
drinking
some
hypocras
which
do
not
break
my
vowe
it
being
to
the
best
of
my
present
judgement
only
a
mixed
compound
drink
and
not
any
wine
if
i
am
mistaken
god
forgive
me
but
i
hope
and
do
think
i
am
not
by
and
by
met
with
creed
and
we
with
the
others
went
within
the
several
courts
and
there
saw
the
tables
prepared
for
the
ladies
and
judges
and
bishops
all
great
sign
of
a
great
dinner
to
come
by
and
by
about
one
before
the
lord
mayor
come
come
into
the
hall
from
the
room
where
they
were
first
led
into
the
lord
chancellor
archbishop
before
him
with
the
lords
of
the
council
and
other
bishopps
and
they
to
dinner
anon
comes
the
lord
mayor
who
went
up
to
the
lords
and
then
to
the
other
tables
to
bid
wellcome
and
so
all
to
dinner
i
set
near
proby
baron
and
creed
at
the
merchant
strangers
table
where
ten
good
dishes
to
a
messe
with
plenty
of
wine
of
all
sorts
of
which
i
drunk
none
but
it
was
very
unpleasing
that
we
had
no
napkins
nor
change
of
trenchers
and
drunk
out
of
earthen
pitchers
and
wooden
dishes
it
happened
that
after
the
lords
had
half
dined
come
the
french
embassador
up
to
the
lords
table
where
he
was
to
have
sat
he
would
not
sit
down
nor
dine
with
the
lord
mayor
who
was
not
yet
come
nor
have
a
table
to
himself
which
was
offered
but
in
a
discontent
went
away
again
after
i
had
dined
i
and
creed
rose
and
went
up
and
down
the
house
and
up
to
the
ladys
room
and
there
stayed
gazing
upon
them
but
though
there
were
many
and
fine
both
young
and
old
yet
i
could
not
discern
one
handsome
face
there
which
was
very
strange
i
expected
musique
but
there
was
none
but
only
trumpets
and
drums
which
displeased
me
the
dinner
it
seems
is
made
by
the
mayor
and
two
sheriffs
for
the
time
being
the
lord
mayor
paying
one
half
and
they
the
other
and
the
whole
proby
says
is
reckoned
to
come
to
about
or
at
most
the
queene
mends
apace
they
say
but
yet
talks
idle
still
to
my
great
sorrow
find
myself
worse
than
i
was
the
last
month
which
was
then
and
now
it
is
but
but
it
hath
chiefly
arisen
from
my
in
clothes
for
myself
and
wife
viz
for
her
about
and
for
myself
or
thereabouts
having
made
myself
a
velvet
cloak
two
new
cloth
skirts
black
plain
both
a
new
shag
gown
trimmed
with
gold
buttons
and
twist
with
a
new
hat
and
silk
tops
for
my
legs
and
many
other
things
being
resolved
henceforward
to
go
like
myself
and
also
two
perriwiggs
one
whereof
costs
me
and
the
other
i
have
worn
neither
yet
but
will
begin
next
week
god
willing
the
queene
continues
but
in
hopes
to
recover
the
plague
is
much
in
amsterdam
and
we
in
fear
of
it
here
which
god
defend
the
turke
goes
on
mighty
in
the
emperor
dominions
and
the
princes
can
not
agree
among
themselves
how
to
go
against
him
november
up
and
by
coach
to
white
hall
and
there
in
the
long
matted
gallery
i
find
sir
carteret
sir
minnes
and
sir
batten
and
by
and
by
comes
the
king
to
walk
there
with
three
or
four
with
him
and
soon
as
he
saw
us
says
he
here
is
the
navy
office
and
there
walked
twenty
turns
the
length
of
the
gallery
talking
methought
but
ordinary
talk
by
and
by
come
the
duke
and
he
walked
and
at
last
they
went
into
the
duke
lodgings
the
king
staid
so
long
that
we
could
not
discourse
with
the
duke
and
so
we
parted
i
heard
the
duke
say
that
he
was
going
to
wear
a
perriwigg
and
they
say
the
king
also
will
i
never
till
this
day
observed
that
the
king
is
mighty
gray
lord
sandwich
tells
me
how
edward
montagu
begins
to
show
respect
to
him
again
after
his
endeavouring
to
bespatter
him
all
was
possible
but
he
is
resolved
never
to
admit
him
into
his
friendship
again
he
tells
me
how
he
and
sir
bennet
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
his
duchesse
was
of
a
committee
with
somebody
else
for
the
getting
of
stewart
for
the
king
but
that
she
proves
a
cunning
slut
and
is
advised
at
somerset
house
by
the
and
by
her
mother
and
so
all
the
plot
is
spoiled
and
the
whole
committee
broke
montagu
and
the
duke
of
buckingham
fallen
the
duchesse
going
to
a
nunnery
and
so
montagu
begins
to
enter
friendship
with
my
lord
and
to
attend
the
chancellor
whom
he
had
deserted
my
lord
tells
me
that
montagu
among
other
things
did
endeavour
to
represent
him
to
the
chancellor
sons
as
one
that
did
desert
their
father
in
the
business
of
my
lord
of
bristoll
which
is
most
false
being
the
only
man
that
hath
several
times
dined
with
him
when
no
soul
hath
come
to
him
and
went
with
him
that
very
day
home
when
the
earl
impeached
him
in
the
parliament
house
and
hath
refused
ever
to
pay
a
visit
to
my
lord
of
bristoll
not
so
much
as
in
return
to
a
visit
of
his
so
that
the
chancellor
and
my
lord
are
well
known
and
trusted
one
by
another
but
yet
my
lord
blames
the
chancellor
for
desiring
to
have
it
put
off
to
the
next
sessions
of
parliament
contrary
to
my
lord
treasurer
advice
to
whom
he
swore
he
would
not
do
it
and
perhaps
my
lord
chanceilor
for
ought
i
see
by
my
lord
discourse
may
suffer
by
it
when
the
parliament
comes
to
sit
my
lord
tells
me
that
he
observes
the
duke
of
york
do
follow
and
understand
business
very
well
and
is
mightily
improved
thereby
to
church
where
i
found
that
my
coming
in
a
perriwigg
did
not
prove
so
strange
as
i
was
afraid
it
would
for
i
thought
that
all
the
church
would
presently
have
cast
their
eyes
all
upon
me
to
the
duke
where
when
we
come
into
his
closet
he
told
us
that
pepys
was
so
altered
with
his
new
perriwigg
that
he
did
not
know
him
so
to
our
discourse
and
among
and
above
other
things
we
were
taken
up
in
talkings
upon
sir
lawson
coming
home
he
being
come
to
portsmouth
and
captain
berkely
is
come
to
town
with
a
letter
from
the
duana
of
algier
to
the
king
wherein
they
do
demand
again
the
searching
of
our
ships
and
taking
out
of
strangers
and
their
goods
and
that
what
english
ships
are
taken
without
the
duke
pass
they
will
detain
though
it
be
flat
contrary
to
the
words
of
the
peace
as
prizes
till
they
do
hear
from
our
king
which
they
advise
him
may
be
speedy
and
this
they
did
the
very
next
day
after
they
had
received
with
great
joy
the
grand
seignor
confirmation
of
the
peace
from
constantinople
by
captain
berkely
so
that
there
is
no
command
nor
certainty
to
be
had
of
these
people
the
king
is
resolved
to
send
his
will
by
a
fleet
of
ships
and
it
is
thought
best
and
speediest
to
send
these
very
ships
that
are
now
come
home
five
sail
of
good
ships
back
again
after
cleaning
victualling
and
paying
them
but
it
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
think
how
their
basha
shavan
aga
did
tear
his
hair
to
see
the
soldiers
order
things
thus
for
just
like
his
late
predecessors
when
they
see
the
evil
of
war
with
england
then
for
certain
they
complain
to
the
grand
seignor
of
him
and
cut
his
head
off
this
he
is
sure
of
and
knows
as
certain
thence
to
westminster
hall
where
i
met
with
pierce
surgeon
and
among
other
things
he
asked
me
seriously
whether
i
knew
any
thing
of
my
lord
being
out
of
favour
with
the
king
and
told
me
that
for
certain
the
king
do
take
mighty
notice
of
my
lord
living
obscurely
in
a
corner
not
like
himself
and
becoming
the
honour
that
he
is
come
to
i
was
sorry
to
hear
and
the
truth
is
from
my
lord
discourse
among
his
people
which
i
am
told
of
the
uncertainty
of
princes
favour
and
his
melancholy
keeping
from
court
i
am
doubtful
of
some
such
thing
but
i
seemed
wholly
strange
to
him
in
it
but
will
make
my
use
of
it
we
told
me
also
how
loose
the
court
is
nobody
looking
after
business
but
every
man
his
lust
and
gain
and
how
the
king
is
now
become
besotted
upon
mrs
stewart
that
he
gets
into
corners
and
will
be
with
her
half
an
hour
together
kissing
her
to
the
observation
of
all
the
world
and
she
now
stays
by
herself
and
expects
it
as
my
lady
castlemaine
did
used
to
do
to
whom
the
king
he
says
is
still
kind
so
as
now
and
then
he
goes
to
her
as
he
believes
but
with
no
such
fondness
as
he
used
to
do
but
yet
it
is
thought
that
this
new
wench
is
so
subtle
that
it
is
verily
thought
if
the
queene
had
died
he
would
have
married
her
blackburne
and
i
fell
to
talk
of
many
things
wherein
he
was
very
open
to
me
first
in
that
of
religion
he
makes
it
greater
matter
of
prudence
for
the
king
and
council
to
suffer
liberty
of
conscience
and
imputes
the
loss
of
hungary
to
the
turke
from
the
emperor
denying
them
this
liberty
of
their
religion
he
says
that
many
pious
ministers
of
the
word
of
god
some
thousands
of
them
do
now
beg
their
bread
and
told
me
how
highly
the
present
clergy
carry
themselves
every
where
so
as
that
they
are
hated
and
laughed
at
by
every
body
among
other
things
for
their
excommunications
which
they
send
upon
the
least
occasions
almost
that
can
be
and
i
am
convinced
in
my
judgement
not
only
from
his
discourse
but
my
thoughts
in
general
that
the
present
clergy
will
never
heartily
go
down
with
the
generality
of
the
commons
of
england
they
have
been
so
used
to
liberty
and
freedom
and
they
are
so
acquainted
with
the
pride
and
debauchery
of
the
present
clergy
he
did
give
me
many
stories
of
the
affronts
which
the
clergy
receive
in
all
places
of
england
from
the
gentry
and
ordinary
persons
of
the
parish
he
do
tell
me
what
the
city
thinks
of
general
monk
as
of
a
most
perfidious
man
that
hath
betrayed
every
body
and
the
king
also
who
as
he
thinks
and
his
party
and
so
i
have
heard
other
good
friends
of
the
king
say
it
might
have
been
better
for
the
king
to
have
had
his
hands
a
little
bound
for
the
present
than
be
forced
to
bring
such
a
crew
of
poor
people
about
him
and
be
liable
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
every
one
of
them
he
told
me
that
to
his
knowledge
being
present
at
every
meeting
at
the
treaty
at
the
isle
of
wight
that
the
old
king
did
confess
himself
and
convinced
in
his
judgement
against
the
bishopps
and
would
have
suffered
and
did
agree
to
exclude
the
service
out
of
the
churches
nay
his
own
chapell
and
that
he
did
always
say
that
this
he
did
not
by
force
for
that
he
would
never
abate
one
inch
by
any
violence
but
what
he
did
was
out
of
his
reason
and
judgement
he
tells
me
that
the
king
by
name
with
all
his
dignities
is
prayed
for
by
them
that
they
call
fanatiques
as
heartily
and
powerfully
as
in
any
of
the
other
churches
that
are
thought
better
and
that
let
the
king
think
what
he
will
it
is
them
that
must
help
him
in
the
day
of
warr
for
so
generally
they
are
the
most
substantiall
sort
of
people
and
the
soberest
and
did
desire
me
to
observe
it
to
my
lord
sandwich
among
other
things
that
of
all
the
old
army
now
you
can
not
see
a
man
begging
about
the
streets
but
what
you
shall
have
this
captain
turned
a
shoemaker
the
lieutenant
a
baker
this
a
brewer
that
a
haberdasher
this
common
soldier
a
porter
and
every
man
in
his
apron
and
frock
as
if
they
had
never
done
anything
else
whereas
the
other
go
with
their
belts
and
swords
swearing
and
cursing
and
stealing
running
into
houses
by
force
oftentimes
to
carry
away
something
and
this
is
the
difference
between
the
temper
of
one
and
the
other
and
concludes
and
i
think
with
some
reason
that
the
spirits
of
the
old
parliament
soldiers
are
so
quiet
and
contented
with
providences
that
the
king
is
safer
from
any
evil
meant
him
by
them
one
thousand
times
more
than
from
his
own
discontented
cavalier
and
then
to
the
publick
management
of
business
it
is
done
as
he
observes
so
loosely
and
so
carelessly
that
the
kingdom
can
never
be
happy
with
it
every
man
looking
after
himself
and
his
own
lust
and
luxury
and
that
half
of
what
money
the
parliament
gives
the
king
is
not
so
much
as
gathered
and
to
the
purpose
he
told
me
how
the
bellamys
who
had
some
of
the
northern
counties
assigned
them
for
their
debt
for
the
petty
warrant
victnalling
have
often
complained
to
him
that
they
can
not
get
it
collected
for
that
nobody
minds
or
if
they
do
they
wo
pay
it
in
whereas
which
is
a
very
remarkable
thing
he
hath
been
told
by
some
of
the
treasurers
at
warr
here
of
late
to
whom
the
most
of
the
monthly
was
paid
that
for
most
months
the
payments
were
gathered
so
duly
that
they
seldom
had
so
much
or
more
than
or
the
like
short
in
the
whole
collection
whereas
now
the
very
commissioners
for
assessments
and
other
publick
payments
are
such
persons
and
those
that
they
choose
in
the
country
so
like
themselves
that
from
top
to
bottom
there
is
not
a
man
carefull
of
any
thing
or
if
he
be
is
not
solvent
that
what
between
the
beggar
and
the
knave
the
king
is
abused
the
best
part
of
all
his
revenue
we
then
talked
of
the
navy
and
of
sir
pen
rise
to
be
a
general
we
told
me
he
was
always
a
conceited
man
and
one
that
would
put
the
best
side
outward
but
that
it
was
his
pretence
of
sanctity
that
brought
him
into
play
lawson
and
portman
and
the
men
among
whom
he
was
a
great
brother
importuned
that
he
might
be
general
and
it
was
pleasant
to
see
how
blackburne
himself
did
act
it
how
when
the
commissioners
of
the
admiralty
would
enquire
of
the
captains
and
admirals
of
such
and
such
men
how
they
would
with
a
sigh
and
casting
up
the
eyes
say
such
a
man
fears
the
lord
or
i
hope
such
a
man
hath
the
spirit
of
god
but
he
tells
me
that
there
was
a
cruel
articling
against
pen
after
one
fight
for
cowardice
in
putting
himself
within
a
coyle
of
cables
of
which
he
had
much
ado
to
acquit
himself
and
by
great
friends
did
it
not
without
remains
of
guilt
but
that
his
brethren
had
a
mind
to
pass
it
by
and
sir
vane
did
advise
him
to
search
his
heart
and
see
whether
this
fault
or
a
greater
sin
was
not
the
occasion
of
this
so
great
tryall
and
he
tells
me
that
what
pen
gives
out
about
cromwell
sending
and
entreating
him
to
go
to
jamaica
is
very
false
he
knows
the
contrary
besides
the
protector
never
was
a
man
that
needed
to
send
for
any
man
specially
such
a
one
as
he
twice
he
tells
me
that
the
business
of
jamaica
did
miscarry
absolutely
by
his
pride
and
that
when
he
was
in
the
tower
he
would
cry
like
a
child
and
that
just
upon
the
turne
when
monk
was
come
from
the
north
to
the
city
and
did
begin
to
think
of
bringing
in
the
king
pen
was
then
turned
quaker
that
lawson
was
never
counted
any
thing
but
only
a
seaman
and
a
stout
man
but
a
false
man
and
that
now
he
appears
the
greatest
hypocrite
in
the
world
and
pen
the
same
he
tells
me
that
it
is
much
talked
of
that
the
king
intends
to
legitimate
the
duke
of
monmouth
and
that
neither
he
nor
his
friends
of
his
persuasion
have
any
hopes
of
getting
their
consciences
at
liberty
but
by
god
almighty
turning
of
the
king
heart
which
they
expect
and
are
resolved
to
live
and
die
in
quiet
hopes
of
it
but
never
to
repine
or
act
any
thing
more
than
by
prayers
towards
it
and
that
not
only
himself
but
all
of
them
have
and
are
willing
at
any
time
to
take
the
oaths
of
allegiance
and
supremacy
blackburne
observed
further
to
me
some
certain
notice
that
he
had
of
the
present
plot
so
much
talked
of
that
he
was
told
by
rushworth
john
rushworth
clerk
assistant
to
the
house
of
commons
and
author
of
the
historical
collections
ob
how
one
captain
oates
a
great
discoverer
did
employ
several
to
bring
and
seduce
others
into
a
plot
and
that
one
of
his
agents
met
with
one
that
would
not
listen
to
him
nor
conceal
what
he
had
offered
him
but
so
detected
the
trapan
he
also
did
much
insist
upon
the
cowardice
and
corruption
of
the
king
guards
and
militia
at
noon
to
the
were
with
allen
some
good
discourse
about
physick
and
chymistry
and
among
other
things
i
telling
him
what
dribble
the
german
doctor
do
offer
of
an
instrument
to
sink
ships
he
tells
me
that
which
is
more
strange
that
something
made
of
gold
which
they
call
in
chymistry
aurum
fulminans
a
grain
i
think
he
said
of
it
put
into
a
silver
spoon
and
fired
will
give
a
blow
like
a
musquett
and
strike
a
hole
through
the
silver
spoon
downward
without
the
least
force
upward
and
this
he
can
make
a
cheaper
experiment
of
he
says
with
iron
prepared
this
day
being
our
queene
birthday
the
guns
of
the
tower
went
all
off
and
in
the
evening
the
lord
mayor
sent
from
church
to
church
to
order
the
constables
to
cause
bonfires
to
be
made
in
every
street
which
methinks
is
a
poor
thing
to
be
forced
to
be
commanded
with
sir
carteret
to
my
lord
treasurer
to
discourse
with
him
about
gauden
having
of
money
and
to
offer
to
him
whether
it
would
not
be
necessary
gauden
credit
being
so
low
as
it
is
to
take
security
of
him
if
he
demands
any
great
sum
such
as
which
now
ought
to
be
paid
him
upon
his
next
year
declaration
which
is
a
sad
thing
that
being
reduced
to
this
by
us
we
should
be
the
first
to
doubt
his
credit
but
so
it
is
however
it
will
be
managed
with
great
tenderness
to
him
my
lord
treasurer
we
found
in
his
chamber
being
laid
up
of
the
goute
i
find
him
a
very
ready
man
and
certainly
a
brave
servant
to
the
king
he
spoke
so
quick
and
sensible
of
the
king
charge
nothing
displeased
me
in
him
but
his
long
nails
which
he
lets
grow
upon
a
pretty
thick
white
short
hand
that
it
troubled
me
to
see
them
in
our
way
sir
carteret
told
me
there
is
no
such
thing
likely
yet
as
a
dutch
war
neither
they
nor
we
being
in
condition
for
it
though
it
will
come
certainly
to
that
in
some
time
our
interests
lying
the
same
way
that
is
to
say
in
trade
but
not
yet
a
great
talk
there
is
of
a
crush
between
some
of
the
fanatiques
up
in
arms
and
the
king
men
in
the
north
but
whether
true
i
know
not
yet
at
chapel
i
had
room
in
the
privy
seale
pew
with
other
gentlemen
and
there
heard
killigrew
preach
henry
youngest
son
of
sir
robert
killigrew
prebendary
of
westminster
and
master
of
the
savoy
and
author
of
some
plays
and
sermons
his
daughter
anne
was
the
celebrated
poetess
the
anthem
was
good
after
sermon
being
the
psalme
made
for
five
voices
by
one
of
captn
cooke
boys
a
pretty
boy
and
they
say
there
are
four
or
five
of
them
that
can
do
as
much
and
here
i
first
perceived
that
the
king
is
a
little
musicall
and
kept
good
time
with
his
hand
all
along
the
anthem
with
alderman
backewell
talking
of
the
new
money
which
he
says
will
never
be
counterfeited
he
believes
but
it
is
so
deadly
inconvenient
for
telling
it
is
so
thick
and
the
edges
are
made
to
turn
up
the
plague
it
seems
grows
more
and
more
at
amsterdam
and
we
are
going
upon
making
of
all
ships
coming
from
thence
and
hambrough
or
any
other
infected
places
to
perform
their
quarantine
for
thirty
days
as
sir
rd
browne
expressed
it
in
the
order
of
the
council
contrary
to
the
import
of
the
word
though
in
the
general
acceptation
it
signifies
now
the
thing
not
the
time
spent
in
doing
it
in
holehaven
a
thing
never
done
by
us
before
to
paul
church
yard
and
there
looked
upon
the
second
part
of
hudibras
which
i
buy
not
but
borrow
to
read
to
see
if
it
be
as
good
as
the
first
which
the
world
cried
so
mightily
up
though
it
hath
not
a
good
liking
in
me
though
i
had
tried
but
twice
or
three
times
reading
to
bring
myself
to
think
it
witty
for
certain
i
am
told
how
in
holland
publickly
they
have
pictured
our
king
with
reproach
one
way
is
with
his
pockets
turned
the
wrong
side
outward
hanging
out
empty
another
with
two
courtiers
picking
of
his
pockets
and
a
third
leading
of
two
ladies
while
other
abuse
him
which
amounts
to
great
contempt
lord
day
this
morning
i
put
on
my
best
black
cloth
suit
trimmed
with
scarlett
ribbon
very
neat
with
my
cloak
lined
with
velvett
and
a
new
beaver
which
altogether
is
very
noble
with
my
black
silk
knit
canons
i
bought
a
month
ago
at
white
hall
sir
pen
and
i
met
the
duke
in
the
matted
gallery
and
there
he
discoursed
with
us
and
by
and
by
my
lord
sandwich
come
and
stood
by
and
talked
but
it
being
andrew
and
a
he
went
to
the
chapel
and
we
parted
december
after
dinner
i
to
guild
hall
to
hear
a
trial
at
king
bench
before
lord
chief
justice
hide
sir
robert
hyde
ob
about
the
insurance
of
a
ship
and
it
was
pleasant
to
see
what
mad
sort
of
testimonys
the
seamen
did
give
and
could
not
be
got
to
speak
in
order
and
then
their
terms
such
as
the
judge
could
not
understand
and
to
hear
how
sillily
the
counsel
and
judge
would
speak
as
to
the
terms
necessary
in
the
matter
would
make
one
laugh
and
above
all
a
frenchman
that
was
forced
to
speak
in
french
and
took
an
english
oath
he
did
not
understand
and
had
an
interpreter
sworn
to
tell
us
what
he
said
which
was
the
best
testimony
of
all
this
day
sir
carteret
did
tell
us
at
the
table
that
the
navy
excepting
what
is
due
to
the
yards
upon
the
quarter
now
going
on
and
what
few
bills
he
hath
not
heard
of
is
quite
out
of
debt
which
is
extraordinary
good
news
and
upon
the
to
hear
how
our
credit
goes
as
good
as
any
merchant
upon
the
is
a
joyfull
thing
to
consider
which
god
continue
i
am
sure
the
king
will
have
the
benefit
of
it
as
well
as
we
some
peace
and
creditt
i
hear
there
was
the
last
night
the
greatest
tide
that
ever
was
remembered
in
england
to
have
been
in
this
river
all
white
hall
having
been
drowned
at
white
hall
and
anon
the
king
and
duke
and
duchesse
come
to
dinner
in
the
where
i
never
saw
them
before
but
it
seems
since
the
tables
are
done
he
dines
there
the
queene
is
pretty
well
and
goes
out
of
her
chamber
to
her
little
chapel
in
the
house
the
king
of
france
they
say
is
hiring
of
sixty
sail
of
ships
of
the
dutch
but
it
is
not
said
for
what
design
to
white
hall
where
a
great
while
walked
with
my
lord
teviott
whom
i
find
a
most
carefull
thoughtfull
and
cunning
man
as
i
also
ever
took
him
to
be
he
is
this
day
bringing
in
an
account
where
he
makes
the
king
debtor
to
him
already
on
the
garrison
of
tangier
account
but
yet
demands
not
ready
money
to
pay
it
but
offers
such
ways
of
paying
it
out
of
the
sale
of
old
decayed
provisions
as
will
enrich
him
finely
to
paul
church
yard
to
my
bookseller
and
could
not
tell
whether
to
lay
out
my
money
for
books
of
pleasure
as
plays
which
my
nature
was
most
earnest
in
but
at
last
after
seeing
chaucer
dugdale
history
of
paul
stow
london
gesner
history
of
trent
besides
shakespeare
jonson
and
beaumont
plays
i
at
last
chose
fuller
worthys
the
cabbala
or
collections
of
letters
of
state
and
a
little
book
delices
de
hollande
with
another
little
book
or
two
all
of
good
use
or
serious
pleasure
and
hudibras
both
parts
the
book
now
in
greatest
fashion
for
drollery
though
i
can
not
i
confess
see
enough
where
the
wit
lies
my
mind
being
thus
settled
i
went
by
link
home
and
so
to
my
office
and
to
read
in
rushworth
and
so
home
to
supper
and
calling
at
wotton
my
shoemaker
he
tells
me
that
sir
wright
is
dying
and
that
harris
is
come
to
the
duke
house
again
and
of
a
rare
play
to
be
acted
this
week
of
sir
william
davenant
the
story
of
henry
the
eighth
with
all
his
wives
at
the
i
went
and
sat
by
harrington
and
some
east
country
merchants
and
talking
of
the
country
above
quinsborough
perhaps
harrington
invented
the
name
of
this
place
and
the
account
of
the
country
and
thereabouts
he
told
us
himself
that
for
fish
none
there
the
poorest
body
will
buy
a
dead
fish
but
must
be
alive
unless
it
be
in
the
winter
and
then
they
told
us
the
manner
of
putting
their
nets
into
the
water
through
holes
made
in
the
thick
ice
they
will
spread
a
net
of
half
a
mile
long
and
he
hath
known
a
hundred
and
thirty
and
a
hundred
and
seventy
barrels
of
fish
taken
at
one
draught
and
then
the
people
come
with
sledges
upon
the
ice
with
snow
at
the
bottome
and
lay
the
fish
in
and
cover
them
with
snow
and
so
carry
them
to
market
and
he
hath
seen
when
the
said
fish
have
been
frozen
in
the
sledge
so
as
he
hath
taken
a
fish
and
broke
so
hard
it
hath
been
and
yet
the
same
fishes
taken
out
of
the
snow
and
brought
into
a
hot
room
still
be
alive
and
leap
up
and
down
swallows
are
often
brought
up
in
their
nets
out
of
the
mudd
from
under
water
hanging
together
to
some
twigg
or
other
dead
in
ropes
and
brought
to
the
fire
will
come
to
life
fowl
killed
in
december
alderman
barker
said
he
did
buy
and
putting
into
the
box
under
his
sledge
did
forget
to
take
them
out
to
eate
till
aprill
next
and
they
then
were
found
there
and
were
through
the
frost
as
sweet
and
fresh
and
eat
as
well
as
at
first
killed
young
beares
appear
there
their
flesh
sold
in
market
as
ordinarily
as
beef
here
and
is
excellent
sweet
meat
they
tell
us
that
beares
there
do
never
hurt
any
body
but
fly
away
from
you
unless
you
pursue
and
set
upon
them
but
wolves
do
much
mischief
harrington
told
us
how
they
do
to
get
so
much
honey
as
they
send
abroad
they
make
hollow
a
great
leaving
only
a
small
slitt
down
straight
in
one
place
and
this
they
close
up
again
only
leave
a
little
hole
and
there
the
bees
go
in
and
fill
the
bodys
of
those
trees
as
full
of
wax
and
honey
as
they
can
hold
and
the
inhabitants
at
times
go
and
open
the
slit
and
take
what
they
please
without
killing
the
bees
and
so
let
them
live
there
still
and
make
more
fir
trees
are
always
planted
close
together
because
of
keeping
one
another
from
the
violence
of
the
windes
and
when
a
fellit
is
made
they
leave
here
and
there
a
grown
tree
to
preserve
the
young
ones
coming
up
the
great
entertainment
and
sport
of
the
duke
of
corland
and
the
princes
thereabouts
is
hunting
which
is
not
with
dogs
as
we
but
he
appoints
such
a
day
and
summonses
all
the
country
people
as
to
a
campagnia
and
by
several
companies
gives
every
one
their
circuit
and
they
agree
upon
a
place
where
the
toyle
is
to
be
set
and
so
making
fires
every
company
as
they
go
they
drive
all
the
wild
beasts
whether
bears
wolves
foxes
swine
and
stags
and
roes
into
the
toyle
and
there
the
great
men
have
their
stands
in
such
and
such
places
and
shoot
at
what
they
have
a
mind
to
and
that
is
their
hunting
they
are
not
very
populous
there
by
reason
that
people
marry
women
seldom
till
they
are
towards
or
above
thirty
and
men
thirty
or
forty
or
more
oftentimes
years
old
against
a
public
hunting
the
duke
sends
that
no
wolves
be
killed
by
the
people
and
whatever
harm
they
do
the
duke
makes
it
good
to
the
person
that
suffers
it
as
harrington
instanced
in
a
house
were
he
lodged
where
a
wolfe
broke
into
a
and
bit
three
or
four
great
pieces
off
of
the
back
of
the
hog
before
the
house
could
come
to
help
it
and
the
man
of
the
house
told
him
that
there
were
three
or
four
wolves
thereabouts
that
did
them
great
hurt
but
it
was
no
matter
for
the
duke
was
to
make
it
good
to
him
otherwise
he
would
kill
them
we
had
this
morning
a
great
dispute
between
gauden
victualler
of
the
navy
and
sir
lawson
and
the
rest
of
the
commanders
going
against
argier
about
their
fish
and
keeping
of
lent
which
gauden
so
much
insists
upon
to
have
it
observed
as
being
the
only
thing
that
makes
up
the
loss
of
his
dear
bargain
all
the
rest
of
the
year
this
day
i
heard
my
lord
barkeley
tell
sir
carteret
that
he
hath
letters
from
france
that
the
king
hath
emduked
twelve
dukes
only
to
show
his
power
and
to
crush
his
nobility
who
he
said
he
did
see
had
heretofore
laboured
to
cross
him
and
this
my
lord
barkeley
did
mightily
magnify
as
a
sign
of
a
brave
and
vigorous
mind
that
what
he
saw
fit
to
be
done
he
dares
do
to
the
duke
where
i
heard
a
large
discourse
between
one
that
goes
over
an
agent
from
the
king
to
legorne
and
thereabouts
to
remove
the
inconveniences
his
ships
are
put
to
by
denial
of
pratique
which
is
a
thing
that
is
made
use
of
only
as
a
cheat
for
a
man
may
buy
a
bill
of
health
for
a
piece
of
eight
and
my
enemy
may
agree
with
the
intendent
of
the
sante
for
ten
pieces
of
eight
or
so
that
he
shall
not
give
me
a
bill
of
health
and
so
spoil
me
in
my
design
whatever
it
be
this
the
king
will
not
endure
and
so
resolves
either
to
have
it
removed
or
to
keep
all
ships
from
coming
in
or
going
out
there
so
long
as
his
ships
are
stayed
for
want
hereof
but
among
other
things
lord
what
an
account
did
sir
minnes
and
sir
batten
make
of
the
pulling
down
and
burning
of
the
head
of
the
charles
where
cromwell
was
placed
with
people
under
his
horse
and
peter
as
the
duke
called
him
is
praying
to
him
and
sir
minnes
would
needs
infer
the
temper
of
the
people
from
their
joy
at
the
doing
of
this
and
their
building
a
gibbet
for
the
hanging
of
his
head
up
when
god
knows
it
is
even
the
flinging
away
of
out
of
the
king
purse
to
the
building
of
another
which
it
seems
must
be
a
neptune
to
the
king
head
ordinary
and
there
dined
among
a
company
of
fine
gentlemen
some
of
them
discoursed
of
the
king
of
france
greatness
and
how
he
is
come
to
make
the
princes
of
the
blood
to
take
place
of
all
foreign
embassadors
which
it
seems
is
granted
by
them
of
venice
and
other
states
and
expected
from
my
lord
hollis
denzil
hollis
second
son
of
john
first
earl
of
clare
created
in
baron
hollis
of
ifield
afterwards
plenipotentiary
for
the
treaty
of
breda
ob
aged
our
king
embassador
there
and
that
either
upon
that
score
or
something
else
he
hath
not
had
his
entry
yet
in
paris
but
hath
received
several
affronts
and
among
others
his
harnesse
cut
and
his
gentlemen
of
his
horse
killed
which
will
breed
bad
blood
if
true
they
say
also
that
the
king
of
france
hath
hired
threescore
ships
of
holland
and
forty
of
the
swede
but
nobody
knows
what
to
do
but
some
great
designs
he
hath
on
foot
against
the
next
year
to
shoe
lane
to
see
a
at
a
new
pit
there
a
spot
i
was
never
at
in
my
life
but
lord
to
see
the
strange
variety
of
people
from
by
name
wildes
that
was
deputy
governor
of
the
tower
when
robinson
was
lord
mayor
to
the
poorest
bakers
brewers
butchers
draymen
and
what
not
and
all
these
fellows
one
with
another
cursing
and
betting
i
soon
had
enough
of
it
it
is
strange
to
see
how
people
of
this
poor
rank
that
look
as
if
they
had
not
bread
to
put
in
their
mouths
shall
bet
three
or
four
pounds
at
a
time
and
lose
it
and
yet
bet
as
much
the
next
battle
so
that
one
of
them
will
lose
or
at
a
meeting
thence
to
my
lord
sandwich
where
i
find
him
within
with
captain
cooke
and
his
boys
childe
madge
and
mallard
playing
and
singing
over
my
lord
anthem
which
he
hath
made
to
sing
in
the
king
chapel
my
lord
took
me
into
the
withdrawing
room
to
hear
it
and
indeed
it
sounds
very
pretty
and
is
a
good
thing
i
believe
to
be
made
by
him
and
they
all
commend
it
i
hear
for
certain
that
my
lady
castlemaine
is
turned
papist
which
the
queene
for
all
do
not
much
like
thinking
that
she
do
it
not
for
conscience
sake

i
heard
of
a
great
fray
lately
between
sir
finch
coachman
who
struck
with
his
whip
a
coachman
of
the
king
to
the
loss
of
one
of
his
eyes
at
which
the
people
of
the
exchange
seeming
to
laugh
and
make
sport
with
some
words
of
contempt
to
him
my
lord
chamberlin
did
come
from
the
king
to
shut
up
the
and
by
the
help
of
a
justice
did
it
but
upon
petition
to
the
king
it
was
opened
again
at
noon
i
to
sir
ford
where
sir
richard
browne
and
i
met
upon
the
freight
of
a
barge
sent
to
france
to
the
duchesse
of
orleans
and
here
by
discourse
i
find
they
greatly
cry
out
against
the
choice
of
sir
john
cutler
to
be
treasurer
of
paul
upon
condition
that
he
gives
towards
it
and
it
seems
he
did
give
it
upon
condition
that
he
might
be
treasurer
for
the
work
which
they
say
will
be
worth
three
times
as
much
money
and
talk
as
if
his
being
chosen
to
the
office
will
make
people
backward
to
give
but
i
think
him
as
likely
a
man
as
either
of
them
and
better
walking
through
white
hall
i
heard
the
king
was
gone
to
play
at
tennis
so
i
down
to
the
new
tennis
court
and
saw
him
and
sir
arthur
slingsby
play
against
my
lord
of
suffolke
and
my
lord
chesterfield
the
king
beat
three
and
lost
two
sets
they
all
and
he
particularly
playing
well
i
thought
thence
went
and
spoke
with
the
duke
of
albemarle
about
his
wound
at
newhall
but
i
find
him
a
heavy
dull
man
methinks
by
his
answers
to
me
the
queene
after
a
long
and
sore
sickness
is
become
well
again
and
the
king
minds
his
mistress
a
little
too
much
if
it
pleased
god
but
i
hope
all
things
will
go
well
and
in
the
navy
particularly
wherein
i
shall
do
my
duty
whatever
comes
of
it
the
great
talk
is
the
design
of
the
king
of
france
whether
against
the
pope
or
king
of
spain
nobody
knows
but
a
great
and
a
most
promising
prince
he
is
and
all
the
princes
of
europe
have
their
eye
upon
him
the
turke
very
far
entered
into
germany
and
all
that
part
of
the
world
at
a
loss
what
to
expect
from
his
proceedings
myself
blessed
be
god
in
a
good
way
and
design
and
resolution
of
sticking
to
my
business
to
get
a
little
money
with
doing
the
best
service
i
can
to
the
king
also
which
god
continue
so
ends
the
old
year
january
at
the
where
much
talking
about
a
very
rich
widow
young
and
handsome
of
one
sir
nicholas
gold
a
merchant
lately
fallen
and
of
great
courtiers
that
already
look
after
her
her
husband
not
dead
a
week
yet
she
is
reckoned
worth
went
to
the
duke
house
the
first
play
i
have
been
at
these
six
months
according
to
my
last
vowe
and
here
saw
the
so
much
play
of
henry
the
eighth
which
though
i
went
with
resolution
to
like
it
is
so
simple
a
thing
made
up
of
a
great
many
patches
that
besides
the
shows
and
processions
in
it
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
good
or
well
done
i
to
my
lord
sandwich
lodgings
but
he
not
being
up
i
to
the
duke
chamber
and
there
by
and
by
to
his
closet
where
since
his
lady
was
ill
a
little
red
bed
of
velvet
is
brought
for
him
to
lie
alone
which
is
a
very
pretty
one
after
doing
business
here
i
to
my
lord
again
and
there
spoke
with
him
and
he
seems
now
almost
friends
again
as
he
used
to
be
here
meeting
pierce
the
surgeon
he
told
me
among
other
court
news
how
the
queene
is
very
well
again
and
that
she
speaks
now
very
pretty
english
and
makes
her
sense
out
now
and
then
with
pretty
phrazes
as
among
others
this
is
mightily
cried
up
that
meaning
to
say
that
she
did
not
like
such
a
horse
so
well
as
the
rest
he
being
too
prancing
and
full
of
tricks
she
said
he
did
make
too
much
vanity
to
the
tennis
court
and
there
saw
the
king
play
at
tennis
and
others
but
to
see
how
the
king
play
was
extolled
without
any
cause
at
all
was
a
loathsome
sight
though
sometimes
indeed
he
did
play
very
well
and
deserved
to
be
commended
but
such
open
flattery
is
beastly
afterwards
to
james
park
seeing
people
play
at
pell
mell
where
it
pleased
me
mightily
to
hear
a
gallant
lately
come
from
france
swear
at
one
of
his
companions
for
suffering
his
man
a
spruce
blade
to
be
so
saucy
as
to
strike
a
ball
while
his
master
was
playing
on
the
mall
this
morning
i
began
a
practice
which
i
find
by
the
ease
i
do
it
with
that
i
shall
continue
it
saving
me
money
and
time
that
is
to
trimme
myself
with
a
razer
which
pleases
me
mightily
we
had
great
pleasure
this
afternoon
among
other
things
to
talk
of
our
old
passages
together
in
cromwell
time
and
how
symons
did
make
me
laugh
and
wonder
when
he
told
me
how
he
had
made
shift
to
keep
in
in
good
esteem
and
employment
through
eight
governments
in
one
year
the
year
which
were
indeed
and
he
did
name
them
all
and
then
failed
unhappy
in
the
ninth
viz
that
of
the
king
coming
in
he
made
good
to
me
the
story
which
luellin
did
tell
me
the
other
day
of
his
wife
upon
her
how
she
dreamt
of
her
uncle
scobell
and
did
foretell
from
some
discourse
she
had
with
him
that
she
should
die
four
days
thence
and
not
sooner
and
did
all
along
say
so
and
did
so
upon
the
a
great
talk
there
was
of
one
tryan
an
old
man
a
merchant
in
robbed
lest
night
his
man
and
maid
being
gone
out
after
he
was
and
gagged
and
robbed
of
in
money
and
about
in
jewells
which
he
had
in
his
house
as
security
for
money
it
is
believed
that
his
man
is
guilty
of
confederacy
by
their
ready
going
to
his
secret
till
in
the
desk
wherein
the
key
of
his
lay
by
discourse
with
my
wife
thought
upon
inviting
my
lord
sandwich
to
a
dinner
shortly
it
will
cost
me
at
least
ten
or
twelve
pounds
but
however
some
arguments
of
prudence
i
have
which
i
shall
think
again
upon
before
i
proceed
to
that
expence
all
our
discourse
was
about
tryan
late
being
robbed
and
that
colonel
turner
a
mad
swearing
confident
fellow
well
known
by
all
and
by
me
one
much
indebted
to
this
man
for
his
very
livelihood
was
the
man
that
either
did
or
plotted
it
and
the
money
and
things
are
found
in
his
hand
and
he
and
his
wife
now
in
newgate
for
it
of
which
we
are
all
glad
so
very
a
known
rogue
he
was
by
invitation
to
james
where
at
chamber
i
dined
with
my
lord
barkeley
sir
carteret
sir
edward
turner
speaker
of
the
house
of
commons
and
afterwards
and
lord
chief
baron
ob
sir
ellis
layton
brother
to
leighton
bishop
of
dumblane
and
had
been
secretary
to
the
duke
of
york
and
one
seymour
a
fine
gentleman
where
admirable
good
discourse
of
all
sorts
pleasant
and
serious
this
morning
i
stood
by
the
king
arguing
with
a
pretty
quaker
woman
that
delivered
to
him
a
desire
of
hers
in
writing
the
king
showed
her
sir
minnes
as
a
man
the
fittest
for
her
quaking
religion
she
modestly
saying
nothing
till
he
begun
seriously
to
discourse
with
her
arguing
the
truth
of
his
spirit
against
hers
she
replying
still
with
these
words
o
king
and
thou
all
along
the
general
talk
of
the
towne
still
is
of
colonel
turner
about
the
robbery
who
it
is
thought
will
be
hanged
i
heard
the
duke
of
york
tell
how
letters
are
come
that
fifteen
are
condemned
for
the
late
plot
by
the
judges
at
york
and
among
others
captain
oates
against
whom
it
was
proved
that
he
drew
his
sword
at
his
going
out
and
flinging
away
the
scabbard
said
that
he
would
either
return
victor
or
be
hanged
by
coach
to
the
after
having
been
at
the
coffee
house
where
i
hear
turner
vide
state
trials
is
found
guilty
of
felony
and
burglary
and
strange
stories
of
his
confidence
at
the
barr
but
yet
great
indignation
in
his
arguing
all
desirous
of
his
being
hanged
my
lord
sandwich
did
seal
a
lease
for
the
house
he
is
now
taking
in
lincoln
inn
fields
which
stands
him
in
per
annum
rent
sir
richard
ford
told
me
that
turner
is
to
be
hanged
and
with
what
impudence
he
hath
carried
out
his
trial
but
that
last
night
when
he
brought
him
news
of
his
death
he
began
to
be
sober
and
shed
some
tears
and
he
hopes
will
die
a
penitent
he
having
already
confessed
all
the
thing
but
says
it
was
partly
done
for
a
joke
and
partly
to
get
an
occasion
of
obliging
the
old
man
by
his
care
in
getting
him
his
things
again
he
having
some
hopes
of
being
the
better
by
him
in
his
estate
at
his
death
pierce
tells
me
that
my
lady
castlemaine
is
not
at
all
set
by
by
the
king
but
that
he
do
doat
upon
stewart
only
and
that
to
the
leaving
out
all
business
in
the
world
and
to
the
open
slighting
of
the
queene
that
he
values
not
who
sees
him
or
stands
by
him
while
he
dailies
with
her
openly
and
then
privately
in
her
chamber
below
where
the
very
sentrys
observe
his
going
in
and
out
and
that
so
commonly
that
the
duke
or
any
of
the
nobles
when
they
would
ask
where
the
king
is
they
will
ordinarily
say
is
the
king
above
or
below
meaning
with
mrs
stewart
that
the
king
do
not
openly
disown
my
lady
castlemaine
but
that
she
comes
to
court
but
that
my
lord
fitzharding
and
the
hambletons
geoge
hamilton
and
the
count
antoine
hamilton
author
of
the
memoires
de
grammont
and
sometimes
my
lord
sandwich
they
say
intrigue
with
her
but
he
says
my
lord
sandwich
will
lead
her
from
her
lodgings
in
the
darkest
and
obscurest
manner
and
leave
her
at
the
entrance
into
the
queene
lodgings
that
he
might
be
the
least
observed
that
the
duke
of
monmouth
the
king
do
still
doat
on
beyond
measure
insomuch
that
the
king
only
the
duke
of
york
and
prince
rupert
and
the
duke
of
monmouth
do
now
wear
deep
mourning
that
is
long
cloaks
for
the
duchesse
of
savoy
so
that
he
mourns
as
a
prince
of
the
blood
while
the
duke
of
york
do
no
more
and
all
the
nobles
of
the
land
not
so
much
which
gives
great
offence
and
he
sees
the
duke
of
york
do
consider
but
that
the
duke
of
york
do
give
himself
up
to
business
and
is
like
to
prove
a
noble
prince
and
so
indeed
i
do
from
my
heart
think
he
will
he
says
that
it
is
believed
as
well
as
hoped
that
care
is
taken
to
lay
up
a
hidden
treasure
of
money
by
the
king
against
a
bad
day
i
pray
god
it
be
so
up
and
after
sending
my
wife
to
my
aunt
wright
to
get
a
place
to
see
turner
hanged
i
to
the
and
seeing
people
flock
in
the
city
i
enquired
and
found
that
turner
was
not
yet
hanged
and
so
i
went
among
them
to
leadenhall
street
at
the
end
of
lyme
street
near
where
the
robbery
was
done
and
to
mary
axe
where
he
lived
and
there
i
got
for
a
shilling
to
stand
upon
the
wheel
of
a
cart
in
great
pain
above
an
hour
before
the
execution
was
done
he
delaying
the
time
by
long
discourses
and
prayers
one
after
another
in
hopes
of
a
reprieve
but
none
come
and
at
last
was
flung
off
the
ladder
in
his
cloak
a
man
he
was
and
kept
his
countenance
to
the
end
i
was
sorry
to
see
him
it
was
believed
there
were
at
least
or
people
in
the
street
to
deptford
and
there
viewed
sir
petty
vessel
which
hath
an
odd
appearance
but
not
such
as
people
do
make
of
it
tom
killigrew
told
us
of
a
fire
last
night
in
my
lady
castlemaine
lodging
where
she
bid
for
one
to
adventure
the
fetching
of
a
cabinet
out
which
at
last
was
got
to
be
done
and
the
fire
at
last
quenched
without
doing
much
wrong
at
the
where
i
sat
with
sir
ascue
a
distinguished
naval
officer
before
and
after
the
restoration
but
he
never
went
to
sea
subsequently
to
the
action
in
when
he
was
taken
prisoner
and
sir
william
petty
who
in
discourse
is
methinks
one
of
the
most
rational
men
that
ever
i
heard
speak
with
a
tongue
having
all
his
notions
the
most
distinct
and
clear
to
covent
garden
to
buy
a
maske
at
the
french
house
madam
charett
for
my
wife
in
the
way
observing
the
street
full
of
coaches
at
the
new
play
at
the
indian
queene
the
indian
queen
a
tragedy
in
heroic
verse
by
sir
robert
howard
and
mr
dryden
which
for
show
they
say
exceeds
henry
the
eighth
called
to
see
my
brother
tom
who
was
not
at
home
though
they
say
he
is
in
a
deep
consumption
and
will
not
live
two
months
this
evening
i
tore
some
old
papers
among
others
a
romance
which
under
the
title
of
love
a
cheate
i
begun
ten
years
ago
at
cambridge
and
reading
it
over
i
liked
it
very
well
and
wondered
a
little
at
myself
at
my
vein
at
that
time
when
i
wrote
it
doubting
that
i
can
not
do
so
well
now
if
i
would
try
february
i
hear
how
two
men
last
night
justling
for
the
wall
about
the
new
exchange
did
kill
one
another
each
thrusting
the
other
through
one
of
them
of
the
king
chapel
one
cave
and
the
other
a
retayner
of
my
lord
generall
middleton
thence
to
white
hall
where
in
the
duke
chamber
the
king
come
and
stayed
an
hour
or
two
laughing
at
sir
petty
who
was
there
about
his
boat
and
at
gresham
college
in
general
at
which
poor
petty
was
i
perceive
at
some
loss
but
did
argue
discreetly
and
bear
the
unreasonable
follies
of
the
objections
and
other
bystanders
with
great
discretion
and
offered
to
take
oddes
against
the
king
best
boates
but
the
king
would
not
lay
but
cried
him
down
with
words
only
gresham
college
he
mightily
laughed
at
for
spending
time
only
in
weighing
of
ayre
and
doing
nothing
else
since
they
sat
pierce
tells
me
how
the
king
coming
the
other
day
to
his
theatre
to
see
the
indian
queene
which
he
commends
for
a
very
fine
thing
my
lady
castlemaine
was
in
the
next
box
before
he
come
and
leaning
over
other
ladies
awhile
to
whisper
with
the
king
she
rose
out
of
the
box
and
went
into
the
king
and
set
herself
on
the
king
right
hand
between
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
which
he
swears
put
the
king
himself
as
well
as
every
body
else
out
of
countenance
and
believes
that
she
did
it
only
to
show
the
world
that
she
is
not
out
of
favour
yet
as
was
believed
to
the
king
theatre
and
there
saw
the
indian
queen
acted
which
indeed
is
a
most
pleasant
show
and
beyond
my
expectation
the
play
good
but
spoiled
with
the
ryme
which
breaks
the
sense
but
above
my
expectation
most
the
eldest
marshall
anne
marshall
a
celebrated
actress
and
her
youngest
sister
becke
so
frequently
mentioned
in
the
diary
were
i
believe
the
daughters
of
a
presbyterian
minister
but
very
little
seems
to
be
known
about
their
history
one
of
them
is
erroneously
stated
in
the
notes
to
the
memoires
de
grammont
and
davies
dramatic
miscellanies
to
have
become
lord
mistress
for
pepys
uniformly
calls
the
marshalls
by
their
proper
name
and
only
speaks
of
the
other
lady
as
the
first
or
old
roxalana
who
had
quitted
the
stage
vide
and
in
the
same
year
did
do
her
part
most
excellently
well
as
i
ever
heard
woman
in
my
life
but
her
voice
is
not
so
sweet
as
ianthe
malone
says
in
his
history
of
the
english
stage
that
mary
saunderson
performed
ianthe
in
play
of
the
siege
of
rhodes
at
the
first
opening
of
his
theatre
april
she
married
betterton
the
following
year
and
lived
till
having
filled
almost
all
the
female
characters
in
shakespeare
with
great
success
it
is
probable
therefore
that
she
was
the
person
alluded
to
here
and
frequently
mentioned
afterwards
without
any
more
particular
designation
but
however
we
come
home
mightily
contented
here
we
met
pickering
and
he
tells
me
that
the
business
runs
high
between
the
chancellor
and
my
lord
bristoll
against
the
parliament
and
that
my
lord
lauderdale
and
cooper
open
high
against
the
chancellor
which
i
am
sorry
for
in
covent
garden
going
to
fetch
my
wife
i
stopped
at
the
great
there
where
i
never
was
before
where
dryden
the
poet
i
knew
at
cambridge
and
all
the
wits
of
the
town
and
harris
the
player
and
hoole
of
our
college
and
had
i
had
time
then
or
could
at
other
times
it
will
be
good
coming
thither
for
there
i
perceive
is
very
witty
and
pleasant
discourse
but
i
could
not
tarry
and
as
it
was
late
they
were
all
ready
to
go
away
to
paul
school
and
up
to
hear
the
upper
form
examined
and
there
was
kept
by
very
many
of
the
mercers
clutterbucke
probably
alderman
clutterbuck
one
of
the
proposed
knights
of
the
royal
oak
for
middlesex
there
was
a
sir
thomas
clutterbuck
of
london
circiter
barker
harrington
and
others
and
with
great
respect
used
by
them
all
and
had
a
noble
dinner
here
they
tell
me
that
in
colett
dean
of
paul
and
founder
of
the
school
will
he
says
that
he
would
have
a
master
found
for
the
school
that
hath
good
skill
in
latin
and
if
it
could
be
one
that
had
some
knowledge
of
the
greeke
so
little
was
greeke
known
here
at
that
time
wilkins
john
wilkins
warden
of
wadham
college
and
afterwards
dean
of
rippon
consecrated
bishop
of
chester
ob
he
was
a
learned
theologian
and
well
versed
in
mathematics
and
natural
philosophy
and
one
smallwood
posers
pierce
told
me
how
the
king
still
do
doat
upon
his
women
even
beyond
all
shame
and
that
the
good
queene
will
of
herself
stop
before
she
goes
sometimes
into
her
till
she
knows
whether
the
king
be
there
for
fear
he
should
be
as
she
hath
sometimes
taken
him
with
stewart
and
that
some
of
the
best
parts
of
the
queene
joynture
are
contrary
to
faith
and
against
the
opinion
of
my
lord
treasurer
and
his
council
bestowed
or
rented
i
know
not
how
to
my
lord
fitzhardinge
and
stewart
and
others
of
that
crew
that
the
king
do
doat
infinitely
upon
the
duke
of
monmouth
apparently
as
one
that
he
intends
to
have
succeed
him
god
knows
what
will
be
the
end
of
it
great
talk
of
the
dutch
proclaiming
themselves
in
india
lords
of
the
southern
seas
and
denying
traffick
to
all
ships
but
their
own
upon
pain
of
confiscation
which
makes
our
merchants
mad
great
doubt
of
two
ships
of
ours
the
greyhound
and
another
very
rich
coming
from
the
streights
for
fear
of
the
turkes
matters
are
made
up
between
the
pope
and
the
king
of
france
so
that
now
all
the
doubt
is
what
the
french
will
do
with
their
armies
i
did
give
my
wife
brother
and
a
coat
that
i
had
by
me
a
cloth
coat
with
a
gold
edgeing
in
each
seam
that
was
the
lace
of
my
wife
best
pettycoat
that
she
had
when
i
married
her
he
is
going
into
holland
to
seek
his
fortune
to
white
hall
to
the
duke
where
he
first
put
on
a
periwigg
but
methought
his
hair
cut
short
in
order
thereto
did
look
very
prettily
of
itself
before
he
put
on
his
periwigg
great
news
of
the
arrivall
of
two
rich
ships
the
greyhound
and
another
which
they
were
mightily
afraid
of
and
great
insurance
given
this
afternoon
sir
thomas
chamberlin
son
of
william
chamberlayne
an
english
judge
and
created
a
baronet
come
to
the
office
to
me
and
showed
me
several
letters
from
the
east
indys
showing
the
height
that
the
dutch
are
come
to
there
showing
scorn
to
all
the
english
even
in
our
only
factory
there
at
surat
beating
several
men
and
hanging
the
english
standard
george
under
the
dutch
flag
in
scorn
saying
that
whatever
their
masters
do
or
say
at
home
they
will
do
what
they
list
and
be
masters
of
all
the
world
there
and
have
so
proclaimed
themselves
soveraine
of
all
the
south
seas
which
certainly
our
king
can
not
endure
if
the
parliament
will
give
him
money
but
i
doubt
and
yet
do
hope
they
will
not
yet
till
we
are
more
ready
for
it
pierce
tells
me
of
the
king
giving
of
my
lord
fitzharding
two
leases
which
belong
indeed
to
the
queene
worth
to
him
and
how
people
do
talk
of
it
cutler
come
and
walked
and
talked
with
me
a
great
while
and
then
to
the
together
and
it
being
early
did
tell
me
several
excellent
examples
of
men
raised
upon
the
by
their
great
diligence
and
saving
as
also
his
own
fortune
and
how
credit
grew
upon
him
that
when
he
was
not
really
worth
he
had
credit
for
of
sir
rider
how
he
rose
and
others
by
and
by
joyned

us

john
bankes
an
opulent
merchant
residing
in
lincoln
inn
fields

and
how
in
every
case
when
there
was
due
to
him
and

the
dutch
for
injury
done
to
them
in
the
east
indys
oliver
presently
after
the
peace
they
delaying
to
pay
them
the
money
sent
them
word
that
if
they
did
not
pay
them
by
such
a
day
he
would
grant
letters
of
mark
to
those
merchants
against
them
by
which
they
were
so
fearful
of
him
they
did
presently
pay
the
money
every
farthing

my
wife

by
men
that
none
of
his
serious
servants
and
friends
can
come
at
him
these
are
lauderdale
buckingham
hamilton
fitzharding
to
whom
he
hath
it
seems
given
per
annum
in
the
best
part
of
the
estate
and
that
the
old
duke
of
buckingham
could
never
get
of
the
king
projers
is
another
edward
progers
the
and
the
confidant
of
his
amours
ob
aged
and
sir
bennett
he
loves
not
the
queene
at
all
but
is
rather
sullen
to
her
and
she
by
all
reports
incapable
of
children
he
is
so
fond
of
the
duke
of
monmouth
that
every
body
admires
it
and
he
says
that
the
duke
hath
said
that
he
would
be
the
death
of
any
man
that
says
the
king
was
not
married
to
his
mother
though
alsopp
says
it
is
well
known
that
she
was
a
common
strumpet
before
the
king
was
acquainted
with
her
but
it
seems
he
says
that
the
king
is
mighty
kind
to
these
his
bastard
children
and
at
this
day
will
go
at
midnight
to
my
lady
castlemaine
nurses
and
take
the
child
and
dance
it
in
his
arms
that
he
is
not
likely
to
have
his
tables
up
again
in
his
house
for
the
crew
that
are
about
him
will
not
have
him
come
to
common
view
again
but
keep
him
obscurely
among
themselves
he
hath
this
night
it
seems
ordered
that
the
hall
which
there
is
a
ball
to
be
in
before
the
king
be
guarded
as
the
is
by
his
horse
guards
whereas
heretofore
they
were
by
the
lord
chamberlain
or
steward
and
their
people
but
it
is
feared
they
will
reduce
all
to
the
soldiery
and
all
other
places
be
taken
away
and
what
is
worst
of
all
will
alter
the
present
militia
and
bring
all
to
a
flying
army
that
my
lord
lauderdale
being
middleton
enemy
john
earl
of
middleton
general
of
the
forces
in
scotland
and
one
that
scorns
the
chancellor
even
to
open
affronts
before
the
king
hath
got
the
whole
power
of
scotland
into
his
hand
whereas
the
other
day
he
was
in
a
fair
way
to
have
had
his
whole
estate
and
honour
and
life
voted
away
from
him
that
the
king
hath
done
himself
all
imaginable
wrong
in
the
business
of
my
lord
antrim
randall
second
earl
and
first
marquis
of
antrim
ob
in
ireland
who
though
he
was
the
head
of
rebels
yet
he
by
his
letter
owns
to
have
acted
by
his
father
and
mother
and
his
commissions
but
it
seems
the
truth
is
he
hath
obliged
himself
upon
the
clearing
of
his
estate
to
settle
it
upon
a
daughter
of
the
by
my
lord
germin
earl
of
st
albans
i
suppose
in
marriage
be
it
to
whom
the
queene
pleases
which
is
a
sad
story
it
seems
a
daughter
of
the
duke
of
lenox
was
by
force
going
to
be
married
the
other
day
at
somerset
house
to
harry
germin
but
she
got
away
and
run
to
the
king
and
he
says
he
will
protect
her
she
is
it
seems
very
near
akin
to
the
king
such
mad
doings
there
are
every
day
among
them
there
was
a
french
book
in
verse
the
other
day
translated
and
presented
to
the
duke
of
monmouth
in
such
a
high
stile
that
the
duke
of
york
he
tells
me
was
mightily
offended
at
it
the
duke
of
monmouth
mother
brother
hath
a
place
at
court
and
being
a
welchman
i
think
he
told
me
will
talk
very
broad
of
the
king
being
married
to
his
sister
the
king
did
the
other
day
at
the
council
commit
my
lord
digby
george
lord
digby
earl
of
bristol
who
had
been
secretary
of
state
in
but
by
changing
his
religion
while
abroad
at
the
instigation
of
don
john
of
austria
incapacitated
himself
from
being
restored
to
that
office
and
in
consequence
of
the
disappointment
which
he
imputed
to
the
interference
of
the
lord
chancellor
conspired
and
effected
his
ruin
he
was
installed
in
and
died
chaplin
and
steward
and
another
servant
who
went
upon
the
process
begun
there
against
their
lord
to
swear
that
they
saw
him
at
church
and
receive
the
sacrament
as
a
protestant
which
the
judges
said
was
sufficient
to
prove
him
such
in
the
eye
of
the
law
the
king
i
say
did
commit
them
all
to
the
notwithstanding
their
pleading
their
dependance
upon
him
and
the
faith
they
owed
him
as
their
lord
whose
bread
they
eat
and
that
the
king
should
say
that
he
would
soon
see
whether
he
was
king
or
digby
that
the
had
outrun
herself
in
her
expences
and
is
now
come
to
pay
very
ill
or
run
in
debt
the
money
being
spent
that
she
received
for
leases
he
believes
there
is
not
any
money
laid
up
in
bank
as
i
told
him
some
did
hope
but
he
says
from
the
best
informers
he
can
assure
me
there
is
no
such
thing
nor
any
body
that
should
look
after
such
a
thing
and
that
there
is
not
now
above
of
the
dunkirke
money
left
in
stock
that
oliver
the
year
when
he
spent
in
the
navy
did
spend
in
the
whole
expence
of
the
kingdom
that
all
the
court
are
mad
for
a
dutch
war
but
both
he
and
i
did
concur
that
it
was
a
thing
rather
to
be
dreaded
than
hoped
for
unless
by
the
french
king
falling
upon
flanders
they
and
the
dutch
should
be
divided
that
our
embassador
had
it
is
true
an
audience
but
in
the
most
dishonourable
way
that
could
be
for
the
princes
of
the
blood
though
invited
by
our
embassador
which
was
the
greatest
absurdity
that
ever
embassador
committed
these
years
were
not
there
and
so
were
not
said
to
give
place
to
our
embassador
and
that
our
king
did
openly
say
the
other
day
in
the
privy
chamber
that
he
would
not
be
hectored
out
of
his
right
and
by
the
king
of
france
as
great
as
he
was
that
the
pope
is
glad
to
yield
to
a
peace
with
the
french
as
the
says
upon
the
basest
terms
that
ever
was
that
the
talk
which
these
people
about
our
king
that
i
named
before
have
is
to
tell
him
how
neither
priviledge
of
parliament
nor
city
is
any
thing
but
that
his
will
is
all
and
ought
to
be
so
and
their
discourse
it
seems
when
they
are
alone
is
so
base
and
sordid
that
it
makes
the
eares
of
the
very
gentlemen
of
the
back
stairs
i
think
he
called
them
to
tingle
to
hear
it
spoke
in
the
king
hearing
and
that
must
be
very
bad
indeed
that
my
lord
digby
did
send
to
lisbon
a
couple
of
priests
to
search
out
what
they
could
against
the
chancellor
concerning
the
match
as
to
the
point
of
his
knowing
that
the
queene
was
not
capable
of
bearing
children
and
that
something
was
given
her
to
make
her
so
but
as
private
as
they
were
when
they
come
thither
they
were
clapped
up
prisoners
that
my
lord
digby
endeavours
what
he
can
to
bring
the
business
into
the
house
of
commons
hoping
there
to
master
the
chancellor
there
being
many
enemies
of
his
there
but
i
hope
the
contrary
that
whereas
the
late
king
did
mortgage
clarendon
clarendon
park
near
salisbury
to
somebody
for
and
this
to
have
given
it
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
he
sold
it
to
my
lord
chancellor
whose
title
of
earldome
is
fetched
from
thence
the
king
hath
this
day
sent
his
order
to
the
privy
seale
for
the
payment
of
this
to
my
lord
chancellor
to
clear
the
mortgage
ireland
in
a
very
distracted
condition
about
the
hard
usage
which
the
protestants
meet
with
and
the
too
good
which
the
catholiques
and
from
all
together
god
knows
my
heart
i
expect
nothing
but
ruin
can
follow
unless
things
are
better
ordered
in
a
little
time
this
day
by
the
blessing
of
god
i
have
lived
years
in
the
world
and
by
the
grace
of
god
i
find
myself
not
only
in
good
health
in
every
thing
and
particularly
as
to
the
stone
but
only
pain
upon
taking
cold
and
also
in
a
fair
way
of
coming
to
a
better
esteem
and
estate
in
the
world
than
ever
i
expected
but
i
pray
god
give
me
a
heart
to
fear
a
fall
and
to
prepare
for
it
ash
wednesday
to
the
queene
chapel
where
i
staid
and
saw
their
masse
till
a
man
come
and
bid
me
go
out
or
kneel
down
so
i
did
go
out
and
thence
to
somerset
house
and
there
into
the
chapel
where
monsieur
probably
author
of
a
small
volume
called
shibboleth
ou
reformation
de
quelques
passages
de
la
bible
per
jean
ministre
du
evangile
in
the
pepysian
collection
printed
and
dedicated
to
cromwell
used
to
preach
but
now
it
is
made
very
fine
and
was
ten
times
more
crouded
than
the
queene
chapel
at
james
which
i
wonder
at
thence
down
to
the
garden
of
somerset
house
and
up
and
down
the
new
building
which
in
every
respect
will
be
mighty
magnificent
and
costly
sir
martin
noell
told
us
the
dispute
between
him
as
farmer
of
the
additional
duty
and
the
east
india
company
whether
callico
be
linnen
or
no
which
he
says
it
is
having
been
ever
esteemed
so
they
say
it
is
made
of
cotton
woole
and
grows
upon
trees
not
like
flax
or
hemp
but
it
was
carried
against
the
company
though
they
stand
out
against
the
verdict
lord
day
up
and
walked
to
paul
and
by
chance
it
was
an
extraordinary
day
for
the
readers
of
the
inns
of
court
and
all
the
students
to
come
to
church
it
being
an
old
ceremony
not
used
these
years
upon
the
first
sunday
in
lent
abundance
there
was
of
students
more
than
there
was
room
to
seat
but
upon
forms
and
the
church
mighty
full
one
hawkins
preached
an
oxford
man
a
good
sermon
upon
these
words
but
the
wisdom
from
above
is
first
pure
then
peaceable
both
before
and
after
sermon
i
was
most
impatiently
troubled
at
the
quire
the
worst
that
ever
i
heard
but
what
was
extraordinary
the
bishop
of
london
humphrey
henchman
translated
from
salisbury
september
ob
who
sat
there
in
a
pew
made
a
purpose
for
him
by
the
pulpitt
do
give
the
last
blessing
to
the
congregation
which
was
he
being
a
comely
old
man
a
very
decent
thing
methought
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
sir
robinson
would
needs
have
me
by
coach
home
with
him
where
the
officers
of
his
regiment
dined
with
him
after
dinner
to
chapel
in
the
tower
with
the
lieutenant
with
the
keyes
carried
before
us
and
the
warders
and
going
before
us
and
i
sat
with
the
lieutenant
in
his
pew
in
great
state
none
it
seems
of
the
prisoners
in
the
tower
that
are
there
now
though
they
may
will
come
to
prayers
there
to
sir
philip
warwick
who
showed
me
many
excellent
collections
of
the
state
of
the
revenue
in
former
kings
and
the
late
times
and
the
present
he
showed
me
how
the
very
assessments
between
and
which
were
taxes
besides
excise
customes
sequestrations
decimations
king
and
and
church
lands
or
any
thing
else
but
just
the
assessments
come
to
above
fifteen
millions
he
showed
me
a
discourse
of
his
concerning
the
revenues
of
this
and
foreign
states
how
that
of
spayne
was
great
but
divided
with
his
kingdoms
and
so
come
to
little
how
that
of
france
did
and
do
much
exceed
ours
before
for
quantity
and
that
it
is
at
the
will
of
the
prince
to
tax
what
he
will
upon
his
people
which
is
not
here
that
the
hollanders
have
the
best
manner
of
tax
which
is
only
upon
the
expence
of
provisions
by
an
excise
and
do
conclude
that
no
other
tax
is
proper
for
england
but
a
or
excise
upon
the
expence
of
provisions
he
showed
me
every
particular
sort
of
payment
away
of
money
since
the
king
coming
in
to
this
day
and
told
me
from
one
to
one
how
little
he
hath
received
of
profit
from
most
of
them
and
i
believe
him
truly
that
the
which
the
parliament
with
so
much
ado
did
first
vote
to
give
the
king
and
since
hath
been
by
several
committees
of
the
present
parliament
is
yet
above
short
of
making
up
really
to
the
king
the
as
by
particulars
he
showed
me
and
in
my
lord
treasurer
excellent
letter
to
the
king
upon
this
subject
he
tells
the
king
how
it
was
the
spending
more
than
the
revenue
that
did
give
the
first
occasion
of
his
fathers
ruine
and
did
since
to
the
rebels
who
he
says
just
like
henry
the
eighth
had
great
and
sudden
increase
of
wealth
but
yet
by
overspending
both
died
poor
and
further
tells
the
king
how
much
of
this
depends
upon
the
life
of
the
prince
and
so
must
be
renewed
by
parliament
again
to
his
successor
which
is
seldom
done
without
parting
with
some
of
the
prerogatives
of
the
crowne
or
if
denied
and
he
persists
to
take
it
of
the
people
it
gives
occasion
to
a
civill
war
which
did
in
the
late
business
of
tonnage
and
poundage
prove
fatal
to
the
crowne
he
showed
me
how
many
ways
the
lord
treasurer
did
take
before
he
moved
the
king
to
farme
the
customes
in
the
manner
he
do
and
the
reasons
that
moved
him
to
do
it
he
showed
me
a
very
excellent
argument
to
prove
that
our
importing
lesse
than
we
export
do
not
impoverish
the
kingdom
according
to
the
received
opinion
which
though
it
be
a
paradox
and
that
i
do
not
remember
the
argument
yet
methought
there
was
a
great
deal
in
what
he
said
and
upon
the
whole
i
find
him
a
most
exact
and
methodicall
man
and
of
great
industry
and
very
glad
that
he
thought
fit
to
show
me
all
this
though
i
can
not
easily
guess
the
reason
why
he
should
do
it
to
me
unless
from
the
plainness
that
he
sees
i
use
to
him
in
telling
him
how
much
the
king
may
suffer
for
our
want
of
understanding
the
case
of
our
treasury
march
this
morning
burgby
one
of
the
writing
clerks
belonging
to
the
council
a
knowing
man
complains
to
me
how
most
of
the
lords
of
the
council
do
look
after
themselves
and
their
own
ends
and
none
the
public
unless
sir
edward
nicholas
sir
carteret
is
diligent
but
for
all
his
own
ends
and
profit
my
lord
privy
seale
a
destroyer
of
every
body
business
and
do
no
good
at
all
to
the
public
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
gilbert
sheldon
speaks
very
little
nor
do
much
being
now
come
to
the
highest
pitch
that
he
can
expect
he
tells
me
that
he
believes
that
things
will
go
very
high
against
the
chancellor
by
digby
and
that
bad
things
will
be
proved
talks
much
of
his
neglecting
the
king
and
making
the
king
to
trot
every
day
to
him
when
he
is
well
enough
to
go
to
visit
his
cosen
justice
hide
but
not
to
the
council
or
king
he
commends
my
lord
of
ormond
mightily
in
ireland
but
cries
out
cruelly
of
sir
lane
for
his
corruption
and
that
he
hath
done
my
lord
great
dishonour
by
selling
of
places
here
which
are
now
all
taken
away
and
the
poor
wretches
ready
to
starve
but
nobody
almost
understands
or
judges
of
business
better
than
the
king
if
he
would
not
be
guilty
of
his
father
fault
to
be
doubtfull
of
himself
and
easily
be
removed
from
his
own
opinion
that
my
lord
lauderdale
is
never
from
the
king
care
nor
council
and
that
he
is
a
most
cunning
fellow
upon
the
whole
that
he
finds
things
go
very
bad
every
where
and
even
in
the
council
nobody
minds
the
public
there
were
several
people
trying
a
gun
brought
my
lord
peterborough
this
morning
to
shoot
off
often
one
after
another
without
trouble
or
danger
at
greenwich
i
observed
the
foundation
laying
of
a
very
great
house
for
the
king
which
will
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
at
the
privy
seale
i
enquired
and
found
the
bill
come
for
the
corporation
of
the
royall
fishery
whereof
the
duke
of
york
is
made
present
governor
and
severall
other
very
great
persons
to
the
number
of
made
his
assistants
for
their
lives
whereof
by
my
lord
sandwich
favour
i
am
one
and
take
it
not
only
as
a
matter
of
honour
but
that
that
may
come
to
be
of
profit
to
me
to
white
hall
and
in
the
duke
chamber
while
he
was
dressing
two
persons
of
quality
that
were
there
did
tell
his
regal
highness
how
the
other
night
in
holborne
about
midnight
being
at
cards
a
come
by
and
run
into
the
house
and
told
the
people
the
house
was
upon
this
the
whole
family
was
frighted
concluding
that
the
boy
had
said
that
the
house
was
so
they
left
their
cards
above
and
one
would
have
got
out
of
the
balcony
but
it
was
not
open
the
other
went
up
to
fetch
down
his
children
that
were
in
bed
so
all
got
clear
out
of
the
house
and
no
sooner
so
but
the
house
fell
down
indeed
from
top
to
bottom
it
seems
my
lord
canaille
did
come
too
near
their
foundation
and
so
weakened
the
house
and
down
it
come
which
in
every
respect
is
a
most
extraordinary
passage
the
business
between
my
lords
chancellor
and
bristoll
they
say
is
hushed
up
and
the
latter
gone
or
going
by
the
king
licence
to
france
my
poor
brother
tom
died
to
the
office
where
we
sat
this
afternoon
having
changed
this
day
our
sittings
from
morning
to
afternoon
because
of
the
parliament
which
returned
yesterday
but
was
adjourned
till
monday
next
upon
pretence
that
many
of
the
members
were
said
to
be
upon
the
road
and
also
the
king
had
other
affairs
and
so
desired
them
to
adjourn
till
then
but
the
truth
is
the
king
is
offended
at
my
lord
of
bristoll
as
they
say
whom
he
hath
found
to
have
been
all
this
while
pretending
a
desire
of
leave
to
go
into
france
and
to
have
all
the
differences
between
him
and
the
chancellor
made
up
endeavouring
to
make
factions
in
both
houses
to
the
chancellor
so
the
king
did
this
to
keep
the
houses
from
meeting
and
in
the
meanwhile
sent
a
guard
and
a
herald
last
night
to
have
taken
him
at
wimbleton
where
he
was
in
the
morning
but
could
not
find
him
at
which
the
king
was
and
is
still
mightily
concerned
and
runs
up
and
down
to
and
from
the
chancellor
like
a
boy
and
it
seems
would
make
articles
against
the
chancellor
to
be
treasonable
reflections
against
his
majesty
so
that
the
king
is
very
high
as
they
say
and
god
knows
what
will
follow
upon
it
to
church
and
with
the
chose
a
place
for
my
brother
to
lie
in
just
under
my
mother
pew
but
to
see
how
a
man
tombes
query
bones
are
at
the
mercy
of
such
a
fellow
that
for
sixpence
he
would
as
his
own
words
were
i
will
justle
them
together
but
i
will
make
room
for
him
speaking
of
the
fulness
of
the
middle
isle
where
he
was
to
lie
i
dressed
myself
and
so
did
my
servant
besse
and
so
to
my
again
whither
though
invited
as
the
custom
is
at
one
or
two
they
come
not
till
four
or
five
but
at
last
one
after
another
they
come
many
more
than
i
bid
and
my
reckoning
that
i
bid
was
one
hundred
and
twenty
but
i
believe
there
was
nearer
one
hundred
and
fifty
their
service
was
six
biscuits
and
what
they
pleased
of
burnt
claret
my
cosen
joyce
norton
kept
the
wine
and
cakes
above
and
did
give
out
to
them
that
served
who
had
white
gloves
given
them
but
above
all
i
am
beholden
to
holding
who
was
most
kind
and
did
take
mighty
pains
not
only
in
getting
the
house
and
every
thing
else
ready
but
this
day
in
going
up
and
down
to
see
the
house
filled
and
served
in
order
to
mine
and
their
great
content
i
think
the
men
sitting
by
themselves
in
some
rooms
and
the
women
by
themselves
in
others
very
close
but
yet
room
enough
anon
to
church
walking
out
into
the
street
to
the
conduit
and
so
across
the
street
and
had
a
very
good
company
along
with
the
corps
and
being
come
to
the
grave
as
above
pierson
the
minister
of
the
parish
did
read
the
service
for
buriall
and
so
i
saw
my
poor
brother
laid
into
the
grave
this
day
the
houses
of
parliament
met
and
the
king
met
them
with
the
queene
with
him
and
he
made
a
speech
to
them
among
other
things
discoursing
largely
of
the
plots
abroad
against
him
and
the
peace
of
the
kingdom
and
that
the
dissatisfied
party
had
great
hopes
upon
the
effect
of
the
act
for
a
triennial
parliament
granted
by
his
father
which
he
desired
them
to
peruse
and
i
think
repeal
so
the
houses
did
retire
to
their
own
house
and
did
order
the
act
to
be
read
before
them
and
i
suppose
it
will
be
repealed
though
i
believe
much
against
the
will
of
a
good
many
that
sit
there
to
the
trinity
house
and
there
dined
very
well
and
good
discourse
among
the
old
men
among
other
things
they
observed
that
there
are
but
two
seamen
in
the
parliament
viz
sir
batten
and
sir
pen
and
not
above
twenty
or
thirty
merchants
which
is
a
strange
thing
in
an
island
to
white
hall
and
there
to
chapel
where
it
was
most
infinite
full
to
hear
critton
creighton
the
doctor
preached
upon
the
of
jeremy
and
the
and
verses
about
a
woman
compassing
a
man
meaning
the
virgin
conceiving
and
bearing
our
saviour
it
was
the
worst
sermon
i
ever
heard
him
make
i
must
confess
and
yet
it
was
good
and
in
two
places
very
bitter
advising
the
king
to
do
as
the
emperor
severus
did
to
hang
up
a
presbyter
john
a
short
coat
and
a
long
gowne
interchangeably
in
all
the
courts
of
england
but
the
story
of
severus
was
pretty
that
he
hanged
up
forty
senators
before
the
and
then
made
a
speech
presently
to
the
senate
in
praise
of
his
own
lenity
and
then
decreed
that
never
any
senator
after
that
time
should
suffer
in
the
same
manner
without
consent
of
the
senate
which
he
compared
to
the
proceeding
of
the
long
parliament
against
my
lord
strafford
he
said
the
greatest
part
of
the
lay
magistrates
in
england
were
puritans
and
would
not
do
justice
and
the
powers
were
so
taken
away
and
lessened
that
they
could
not
exercise
the
power
they
ought
he
told
the
king
and
the
ladies
plainly
speaking
of
death
and
of
the
skulls
and
bones
of
dead
men
and
women
how
there
is
no
difference
that
nobody
could
tell
that
of
the
great
marius
or
alexander
from
a
pyoneer
nor
for
all
the
pains
the
ladies
take
with
their
faces
he
that
should
look
in
a
could
not
distinguish
which
was
cleopatra
or
fair
rosamond
or
jane
shore
sir
batten
told
me
how
sir
richard
temple
hath
spoke
very
discontentful
words
in
the
house
about
the
triennial
bill
but
it
hath
been
read
the
second
time
and
committed
and
he
believes
will
go
on
without
more
ado
though
there
are
many
in
the
house
are
displeased
at
it
though
they
dare
not
say
much
but
above
all
expectation
prin
is
the
man
against
it
comparing
it
to
the
idoll
whose
head
was
of
gold
and
his
body
and
legs
and
feet
of
different
metal
so
this
bill
had
several
degrees
of
calling
of
parliaments
in
case
the
king
and
then
the
council
and
then
the
lord
chancellor
and
then
the
sheriffes
should
fail
to
do
it
he
tells
me
also
how
upon
occasion
of
some
being
put
in
the
pillory
for
beating
of
their
masters
or
such
like
thing
in
cheapside
a
company
of
come
and
rescued
them
and
pulled
down
the
pillory
and
they
being
set
up
again
did
the
like
again
the
great
matter
in
the
house
hath
been
that
vaughan
john
vaughan
afterwards
knighted
and
made
chief
justice
of
the
common
pleas
the
great
speaker
is
this
day
come
to
town
and
hath
declared
himself
in
a
speech
of
an
hour
and
a
half
with
great
reason
and
eloquence
against
the
repealing
of
the
bill
for
triennial
parliaments
but
with
no
successe
but
the
house
have
carried
it
that
there
shall
be
such
parliaments
but
without
any
coercive
power
upon
the
king
if
he
will
bring
this
act
but
lord
to
see
how
the
best
things
are
not
done
without
some
design
for
i
perceive
all
these
gentlemen
that
i
was
with
are
against
it
though
there
was
reason
enough
on
their
side
yet
purely
i
could
perceive
because
it
was
the
king
mind
to
have
it
and
should
he
demand
any
thing
else
i
believe
they
would
give
it
him
april
to
white
hall
and
in
the
gallery
met
the
duke
of
york
i
also
saw
the
queene
going
to
the
park
and
her
maids
of
honour
she
herself
looks
ill
and
methinks
stewart
is
grown
fatter
and
not
so
fair
as
she
was
and
he
called
me
to
him
and
discoursed
a
good
while
with
me
and
after
he
was
gone
twice
or
thrice
staid
and
called
me
again
to
him
the
whole
length
of
the
house
and
at
last
talked
of
the
dutch
and
i
perceive
do
much
wish
that
the
parliament
will
find
reason
to
fall
out
with
them
called
up
by
joyce
william
joyce
had
married
pepys
first
cousin
kate
fenner
he
being
summonsed
to
the
house
of
lords
for
endeavouring
to
arrest
my
lady
peters
for
a
debt
elizabeth
daughter
of
john
earl
rivers
and
first
wife
to
william
fourth
lord
petre
who
was
in
impeached
by
the
commons
of
high
treason
and
died
under
confinement
in
the
tower
january
up
and
walked
to
my
lord
sandwich
and
there
spoke
with
him
about
joyce
who
tells
me
he
would
do
what
was
fit
in
so
tender
a
point
i
to
the
lords
house
before
they
sat
and
stood
within
it
while
the
duke
of
york
come
to
me
and
spoke
to
me
a
good
while
about
the
new
ship
at
woolwich
afterwards
i
spoke
with
my
lord
barkeley
and
my
lord
peterborough
about
it
and
so
staid
without
a
good
while
and
saw
my
lady
peters
an
impudent
jade
soliciting
all
the
lords
on
her
behalf
and
at
last
joyce
was
called
in
and
by
the
consequences
and
what
my
lord
peterborough
told
me
i
find
that
he
did
speak
all
he
said
to
his
disadvantage
and
so
was
committed
to
the
black
rod
which
is
very
hard
he
doing
what
he
did
by
the
advice
of
my
lord
own
steward
but
the
serjeant
of
the
black
rod
did
direct
one
of
his
messengers
to
take
him
in
custody
and
peaceably
conducted
him
to
the
swan
with
two
necks
in
to
a
handsome
and
there
was
most
civilly
used
it
was
a
sad
sight
methought
to
see
my
lord
peters
coming
out
of
the
house
fall
out
with
his
lady
from
whom
he
is
parted
about
this
business
saying
that
she
disgraced
him
but
she
hath
been
a
handsome
woman
and
is
it
seems
not
only
a
lewd
woman
but
very
lord
peterborough
presented
a
petition
to
the
house
from
joyce
and
a
great
dispute
we
hear
there
was
in
the
house
for
and
against
it
at
last
it
was
carried
that
he
should
be
bayled
till
the
house
meets
again
after
easter
he
giving
bond
for
his
appearance
anon
comes
the
king
and
passed
the
bill
for
repealing
the
triennial
act
and
another
about
writs
of
errour
i
crowded
in
and
heard
the
king
speech
to
them
but
he
speaks
the
worst
that
ever
i
heard
man
in
my
life
worse
than
if
he
read
it
all
and
he
had
it
in
writing
in
his
hand
i
went
to
joyce
where
i
found
the
order
come
and
bayle
his
father
and
brother
given
and
he
paying
his
fees
which
come
to
above
besides
he
is
to
give
one
man
and
his
charges
of
eating
and
drinking
here
and
as
many
days
as
he
stands
under
bayle
which
i
hope
will
teach
him
hereafter
to
hold
his
tongue
better
than
he
used
to
do
home
to
the
only
lenten
supper
i
have
had
of
wiggs
buns
still
called
wiggs
in
the
west
of
england
and
ale
to
the
duke
house
and
there
saw
the
german
princesse
acted
by
the
woman
herself
but
never
was
any
thing
so
well
done
in
earnest
worse
performed
in
jest
upon
the
stage
mary
moders
alias
stedman
alias
carleton
a
celebrated
impostor
who
had
induced
the
son
of
a
london
citizen
to
marry
her
under
the
pretence
that
she
was
a
german
princess
she
next
became
an
actress
after
having
been
tried
for
bigamy
and
acquitted
the
rest
of
her
life
was
one
continued
course
of
robbery
and
fraud
and
in
she
suffered
at
tyburn
for
stealing
a
piece
of
plate
from
a
tavern
in
up
and
by
coach
to
westminster
and
there
solicited
joyce
business
again
and
did
speak
to
the
duke
of
york
about
it
who
did
understand
it
very
well
i
afterwards
did
without
the
house
fall
in
company
with
my
lady
peters
and
endeavoured
to
mollify
her
but
she
told
me
she
would
not
to
redeem
her
from
hell
do
any
thing
to
release
him
but
would
be
revenged
while
she
lived
if
she
lived
the
age
of
methusalem
i
made
many
friends
and
so
did
others
at
last
it
was
ordered
by
the
lords
that
it
should
be
referred
to
the
committee
of
priviledges
to
consider
so
i
away
by
coach
to
the
and
there
do
hear
that
a
jew
hath
put
in
a
policy
of
four
per
cent
to
any
man
to
insure
him
against
a
dutch
warr
for
four
months
i
could
find
in
my
heart
to
take
him
at
this
offer
to
hide
park
where
i
have
not
been
since
last
year
where
i
saw
the
king
with
his
periwigg
but
not
altered
at
all
and
my
lady
castlemaine
in
a
coach
by
herself
in
yellow
satin
and
a
pinner
on
and
many
brave
persons
and
myself
being
in
a
hackney
and
full
of
people
was
ashamed
to
be
seen
by
the
world
many
of
them
knowing
me
to
the
physique
garden
in
st
james
parke
where
i
first
saw
and
other
fine
trees
coventry
told
me
how
the
committee
for
trade
have
received
now
all
the
complaints
of
the
merchants
against
the
dutch
and
were
resolved
to
report
very
highly
the
wrongs
they
have
done
us
when
god
knows
it
is
only
our
own
negligence
and
laziness
that
hath
done
us
the
wrong
and
this
to
be
made
to
the
house
at
the
lords
house
heard
that
it
is
ordered
that
upon
submission
upon
the
knee
both
to
the
house
and
my
lady
peters
joyce
shall
be
released
i
forthwith
made
him
submit
and
ask
pardon
upon
his
knees
which
he
did
before
several
lords
but
my
lady
would
not
hear
it
but
swore
she
would
post
the
lords
that
the
world
might
know
what
pitifull
lords
the
king
hath
and
that
revenge
was
sweeter
to
her
than
milk
and
that
she
would
never
be
satisfied
unless
he
stood
in
a
pillory
and
demand
pardon
there
but
i
perceive
the
lords
are
ashamed
of
her
i
find
that
the
house
this
day
have
voted
that
the
king
be
desired
to
demand
right
for
the
wrong
done
us
by
the
dutch
and
that
they
will
stand
by
him
with
their
lives
and
fortunes
which
is
a
very
high
vote
and
more
than
i
expected
what
the
issue
will
be
god
knows
i
met
with
coventry
who
himself
is
now
full
of
talk
of
a
dutch
war
for
it
seems
the
lords
have
concurred
in
the
commons
vote
about
it
and
so
the
next
week
it
will
be
presented
to
the
king
saw
joyce
and
the
late
business
hath
cost
the
poor
man
above
besides
he
is
likely
to
lose
his
debt
lady
peters
creed
says
is
a
drunken
jade
he
himself
having
seen
her
drunk
in
the
lobby
of
their
house
my
wife
gone
this
afternoon
to
the
buriall
of
my
scott
a
good
woman
and
it
is
a
sad
consideration
how
the
pepys
decay
and
nobody
almost
that
i
know
in
a
present
way
of
encreasing
them
this
day
the
houses
attended
the
king
and
delivered
their
votes
to
him
upon
the
business
of
the
dutch
and
he
thanks
them
and
promises
an
answer
in
writing
may
to
westminster
hall
and
there
in
the
house
did
in
a
great
crowd
from
ten
till
almost
three
hear
the
cause
of
roberts
vide
lords
journals
of
the
day
my
lord
privy
seale
son
against
win
who
by
false
ways
did
get
the
father
of
roberts
wife
bodvill
to
give
him
the
estate
and
disinherit
his
daughter
the
cause
was
managed
for
my
lord
privy
seale
by
finch
the
solicitor
but
i
do
really
think
that
he
is
a
man
of
as
great
eloquence
as
ever
i
heard
or
ever
hope
to
hear
in
all
my
life
cutler
told
me
how
for
certain
lawson
hath
proclaimed
war
again
with
argier
though
they
had
at
his
first
coming
given
back
the
ships
which
they
had
taken
and
all
their
men
though
they
refused
afterwards
to
make
him
restitution
for
the
goods
which
they
had
taken
my
eyes
beginning
every
day
to
grow
less
and
less
able
to
bear
with
long
reading
or
writing
though
it
be
by
daylight
which
i
never
observed
till
now
in
the
painted
chamber
i
heard
a
fine
conference
between
some
of
the
two
houses
upon
the
bill
for
conventicles
the
lords
would
be
freed
from
having
their
houses
searched
by
any
but
the
lord
lieutenant
of
the
county
and
upon
being
found
guilty
to
be
tried
only
by
their
peers
and
thirdly
would
have
it
added
that
whereas
the
bill
says
that
that
among
other
things
shall
be
a
conventicle
wherein
any
such
meeting
is
found
doing
any
thing
contrary
to
the
liturgy
of
the
church
of
england
they
would
have
it
added
or
practice
the
commons
to
the
lords
said
that
they
knew
not
what
might
hereafter
be
found
out
which
might
he
called
the
practice
of
the
church
of
england
for
there
are
many
things
may
be
said
to
be
the
practice
of
the
church
which
were
never
established
by
any
law
either
common
statute
or
canon
as
singing
of
psalms
binding
up
prayers
at
the
end
of
the
bible
and
praying
extempore
before
and
after
sermon
and
though
these
are
things
indifferent
yet
things
for
aught
they
at
present
know
may
be
started
which
may
be
said
to
be
the
practice
of
the
church
which
would
not
be
fit
to
allow
for
the
priviledges
waller
told
them
how
tender
their
predecessors
had
been
of
the
priviledges
of
the
lords
but
however
where
the
peace
of
the
kingdom
stands
in
competition
with
them
they
apprehend
those
priviledges
must
give
place
he
told
them
that
he
thought
if
they
should
own
all
to
be
the
priviledges
of
the
lords
which
might
be
demanded
they
should
be
led
like
the
man
who
granted
leave
to
his
neighbour
to
pull
off
his
horse
tail
meaning
that
he
could
not
do
it
at
once
that
hair
by
hair
had
his
horse
tail
pulled
off
indeed
so
the
commons
by
granting
one
thing
after
another
might
be
served
by
the
lords
vaughan
whom
i
could
not
to
my
grief
perfectly
hear
did
say
if
that
they
should
be
obliged
in
this
manner
to
exempt
the
lords
from
every
thing
it
would
in
time
come
to
pass
that
whatever
be
it
ever
so
great
should
be
voted
by
the
commons
as
a
thing
penall
for
a
commoner
the
contrary
should
be
thought
a
priviledge
to
the
lords
that
also
in
this
business
the
work
of
a
conventicle
being
but
the
work
of
an
hour
the
cause
of
a
search
would
be
over
before
a
lord
lieutenant
who
may
be
many
miles
off
can
be
sent
for
and
that
all
this
dispute
is
but
about
for
it
is
said
in
the
act
that
it
shall
be
banishment
or
payment
of
i
thereupon
heard
the
duke
of
lennox
say
that
there
might
be
lords
who
could
not
always
be
ready
to
lose
or
some
such
thing
they
broke
up
without
coming
to
any
end
in
it
there
was
also
in
the
commons
house
a
great
quarrel
about
prin
and
it
was
believed
that
he
should
have
been
sent
to
the
tower
for
adding
something
to
a
bill
after
it
was
ordered
to
be
engrossed
of
his
own
head
a
bill
for
measures
for
wine
and
other
things
of
that
sort
and
a
bill
of
his
own
bringing
in
but
it
appeared
he
could
not
mean
any
hurt
in
it
but
however
the
king
was
fain
to
write
in
his
behalf
and
all
was
passed
over
but
it
is
worth
my
remembrance
that
i
saw
old
ryly
the
herald
and
his
son
and
spoke
to
his
son
who
told
me
in
very
bad
words
concerning
prin
that
the
king
had
given
him
an
office
of
keeping
the
records
but
that
he
never
comes
thither
nor
had
been
there
these
six
months
so
that
i
perceive
they
expect
to
get
his
employment
from
him
to
a
committee
of
tangier
where
god
forgive
how
our
report
of
my
lord
peterborough
accounts
was
read
over
and
agreed
to
by
the
lords
without
one
of
them
understanding
it
and
had
it
been
what
it
would
it
had
gone
and
besides
not
one
thing
touching
the
king
profit
in
it
minded
or
hit
upon
edward
montagu
is
turned
out
of
the
court
not
to
return
again
his
fault
i
perceive
was
his
pride
and
most
of
all
his
affecting
to
be
great
with
the
queene
and
it
seems
indeed
he
had
more
of
her
eare
than
every
body
else
and
would
be
with
her
talking
alone
two
or
three
hours
together
insomuch
that
the
lords
about
the
king
when
he
would
be
jesting
with
them
about
their
wives
would
tell
the
king
that
he
must
have
a
care
of
his
wife
too
for
she
hath
now
the
gallant
and
they
say
the
king
himself
did
once
ask
montagu
how
his
mistress
meaning
the
queene
did
he
grew
so
proud
and
despised
every
body
besides
suffering
nobody
he
or
she
to
get
or
do
any
thing
about
the
queene
that
they
all
laboured
to
do
him
a
good
turn
they
all
say
that
he
did
give
some
affront
to
the
duke
of
monmouth
which
the
king
himself
did
speak
to
him
of
so
he
is
gone
nobody
pitying
but
laughing
at
him
and
he
pretends
only
that
he
is
gone
to
his
father
that
is
sick
in
the
country
the
king
is
gone
down
with
the
duke
and
a
great
crew
this
morning
by
break
of
day
to
chatham
coventry
and
i
did
a
long
discourse
together
of
the
business
of
the
office
and
the
war
with
the
dutch
and
he
seemed
to
argue
mightily
with
the
little
reason
that
there
is
for
all
this
for
first
as
to
the
wrong
we
pretend
they
have
done
us
that
of
the
east
indys
for
their
not
delivering
of
poleron
it
is
not
yet
known
whether
they
have
failed
or
no
that
of
their
hindering
the
leopard
can
not
amount
to
above
if
true
that
of
the
guinny
company
all
they
had
done
us
did
not
amount
to
above
or
he
told
me
truly
and
that
now
from
what
holmes
without
any
commission
hath
done
in
taking
an
island
and
two
forts
hath
set
us
much
in
debt
to
them
and
he
believes
that
holmes
will
have
been
so
puffed
up
with
this
that
he
by
this
time
hath
been
enforced
with
more
strength
than
he
had
then
hath
i
say
done
a
great
deal
more
wrong
to
them
he
do
as
to
the
effect
of
the
war
tell
me
clearly
that
it
is
not
any
skill
of
the
dutch
that
can
hinder
our
trade
if
we
will
we
having
so
many
advantages
over
them
of
winds
good
ports
and
men
but
it
is
our
pride
and
the
laziness
of
the
merchant
the
main
thing
he
desired
to
speak
with
me
about
was
to
understand
my
lord
sandwich
intentions
as
to
going
to
sea
with
this
fleet
saying
that
the
duke
if
he
desires
it
is
most
willing
to
do
it
but
thinking
that
twelve
ships
is
not
a
fleet
fit
for
my
lord
to
be
troubled
to
go
out
with
he
is
not
willing
to
offer
it
to
him
till
he
hath
some
intimations
of
his
mind
to
go
or
not
to
the
king
closet
whither
by
and
by
the
king
come
my
lord
sandwich
carrying
the
sword
a
bishop
preached
but
he
speaking
too
low
for
me
to
hear
by
and
by
my
lord
sandwich
come
forth
and
called
me
to
him
and
we
fell
into
discourse
a
great
while
about
his
business
wherein
he
seems
to
be
very
open
with
me
and
to
receive
my
opinion
as
he
used
to
do
and
i
hope
i
shall
become
necessary
to
him
again
he
desired
me
to
think
of
the
fitness
or
not
for
him
to
offer
himself
to
go
to
sea
and
to
give
him
my
thoughts
in
a
day
or
two
thence
after
sermon
among
the
ladies
in
the
queene
side
where
i
saw
stewart
very
fine
and
pretty
but
far
beneath
my
lady
castlemaine
thence
with
povy
home
to
dinner
where
extraordinary
cheer
evelyn
mentions
povy
house
in
lincoln
inn
and
after
dinner
up
and
down
to
see
his
house
and
in
a
word
methinks
for
his
perspective
in
the
little
closet
his
room
floored
above
with
woods
of
several
colours
like
but
above
the
best
i
ever
saw
his
grotto
and
vault
with
his
bottles
of
wine
and
a
well
therein
to
keep
them
cool
his
furniture
of
all
sorts
his
bath
at
the
top
of
the
house
good
pictures
and
his
manner
of
eating
and
drinking
do
surpass
all
that
ever
i
did
see
of
one
man
in
all
my
life
i
was
told
that
upon
sunday
night
last
being
the
king
the
king
was
at
my
lady
castlemaine
lodgings
over
the
at
lambert
lodgings
dancing
with
fiddlers
all
night
almost
and
all
the
world
coming
by
taking
notice
of
it
june
southwell
sir
pen
friend
tells
me
the
very
sad
newes
of
my
lord
teviott
and
nineteen
more
commission
officers
being
killed
at
tangier
by
the
moores
by
an
ambush
of
the
enemy
upon
them
while
they
were
surveying
their
lines
which
is
very
sad
and
he
says
afflicts
the
king
much
to
the
kings
house
and
saw
the
silent
woman
but
methought
not
so
well
done
or
so
good
a
play
as
i
formerly
thought
it
to
be
before
the
play
was
done
it
fell
such
a
storm
of
hayle
that
we
in
the
middle
of
the
pit
were
fain
to
rise
and
all
the
house
in
a
disorder
it
seems
my
lord
teviott
design
was
to
go
a
mile
and
half
out
of
the
town
to
cut
down
a
wood
in
which
the
enemy
did
use
to
lie
in
ambush
he
had
sent
several
spyes
but
all
brought
word
that
the
way
was
clear
and
so
might
be
for
any
body
discovery
of
an
enemy
before
you
are
upon
them
there
they
were
all
snapt
he
and
all
his
officers
and
about
two
hundred
men
as
they
say
there
being
left
now
in
the
garrison
but
four
captains
this
happened
the
of
may
last
being
not
before
that
day
twelvemonth
of
his
entering
into
his
government
there
but
at
his
going
out
in
the
morning
he
said
to
some
of
his
officers
gentlemen
let
us
look
to
ourselves
for
it
was
this
day
three
years
that
so
many
brave
englishmen
were
knocked
on
the
head
by
the
moores
when
fines
made
his
sally
out
coventry
discoursing
this
noon
about
sir
batten
what
a
sad
fellow
he
is
told
me
how
the
king
told
him
the
other
day
how
sir
batten
being
in
the
ship
with
him
and
prince
rupert
when
they
expected
to
fight
with
warwicke
did
walk
up
and
down
sweating
with
a
napkin
under
his
throat
to
dry
up
his
sweat
and
that
prince
rupert
being
a
most
jealous
man
and
particularly
of
batten
do
walk
up
and
down
swearing
bloodily
to
the
king
that
batten
had
a
mind
to
betray
them
and
that
the
napkin
was
a
signal
but
by
god
says
he
if
things
go
ill
the
first
thing
i
will
do
is
to
shoot
him
he
discoursed
largely
and
bravely
to
me
concerning
the
different
sorts
of
valours
the
active
and
passive
valour
for
the
latter
he
brought
as
an
instance
general
blake
who
in
the
defending
of
taunton
and
lime
for
the
parliament
did
through
his
sober
sort
of
valour
defend
it
the
most
opiniastrement
that
ever
any
man
did
any
thing
and
yet
never
was
the
man
that
ever
made
an
attaque
by
land
or
sea
but
rather
avoyded
it
on
all
even
fair
occasions
on
the
other
side
prince
rupert
the
boldest
attaquer
in
the
world
for
personal
courage
and
yet
in
the
defending
of
bristol
no
man
did
any
thing
worse
he
wanting
the
patience
and
seasoned
head
to
consult
and
advise
for
defence
and
to
bear
with
the
evils
of
a
siege
the
like
he
says
of
my
lord
teviott
who
was
the
boldest
adventurer
of
his
person
in
the
world
and
from
a
mean
man
in
few
years
was
come
to
this
greatness
of
command
and
repute
only
by
the
death
of
all
his
officers
he
many
times
having
the
luck
of
being
the
only
survivor
of
them
all
by
venturing
upon
services
for
the
king
of
france
that
nobody
else
would
and
yet
no
man
upon
a
defence
he
being
all
fury
and
no
judgment
in
a
fight
he
tells
me
above
all
of
the
duke
of
york
that
he
is
more
himself
and
more
of
judgment
is
at
hand
in
him
in
the
middle
of
a
desperate
service
than
at
other
times
as
appeared
in
the
business
of
dunkirke
wherein
no
man
ever
did
braver
things
or
was
in
hotter
service
in
the
close
of
that
day
being
surrounded
with
enemies
and
then
contrary
to
the
advice
of
all
about
him
his
counsel
carried
himself
and
the
rest
through
them
safe
by
advising
that
he
might
make
his
passage
with
but
a
dozen
with
him
for
says
he
the
enemy
can
not
move
after
me
so
fast
with
a
great
body
and
with
a
small
one
we
shall
be
enough
to
deal
with
them
and
though
he
is
a
man
naturally
martiall
to
the
hottest
degree
yet
a
man
that
never
in
his
life
talks
one
word
of
himself
or
service
of
his
own
but
only
that
he
saw
such
or
such
a
thing
and
lays
it
down
for
a
maxime
that
a
hector
can
have
no
courage
he
told
me
also
as
a
great
instance
of
some
men
that
the
prince
of
conde
excellence
is
that
there
not
being
a
more
furious
man
in
the
world
danger
in
fight
never
disturbs
him
more
than
just
to
make
him
civill
and
to
command
in
words
of
great
obligation
to
his
officers
and
men
but
without
any
the
least
disturbance
in
his
judgment
or
spirit
by
barge
with
sir
batten
to
trinity
house
here
were
my
lord
sandwich
coventry
my
lord
craven
and
others
a
great
dinner
and
good
company
prin
also
who
would
not
drink
any
health
no
not
the
king
but
sat
down
with
his
hat
on
all
the
while
but
nobody
took
notice
of
it
to
him
at
all
with
my
wife
only
to
take
the
ayre
it
being
very
warm
and
pleasant
to
bowe
and
old
ford
and
thence
to
hackney
there
light
and
played
at
eat
cream
and
good
cherries
and
so
with
good
refreshment
home
spent
the
whole
morning
reading
of
some
old
navy
books
wherein
the
order
that
was
observed
in
the
navy
then
above
what
it
is
now
is
very
observable
at
home
to
look
after
things
for
dinner
and
anon
at
noon
comes
creed
by
chance
and
by
and
by
the
three
young
ladies
lord
sandwich
daughters
and
very
merry
we
were
with
our
pasty
very
well
baked
and
a
good
dish
of
roasted
chickens
pease
lobsters
strawberries
but
after
dinner
to
cards
and
about
five
by
water
down
to
greenwich
and
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
there
played
upon
the
ground
at
cards
and
so
to
the
cherry
garden
and
then
by
water
singing
finely
to
the
bridge
and
there
landed
and
so
took
boat
again
and
to
somerset
house
and
by
this
time
the
tide
being
against
us
it
was
past
ten
of
the
clock
and
such
a
troublesome
passage
in
regard
of
my
lady
paulina
fearfullness
that
in
all
my
life
i
never
did
see
any
poor
wretch
in
that
condition
being
come
hither
there
waited
for
them
their
coach
but
it
being
so
late
i
doubted
what
to
do
how
to
get
them
home
after
half
an
stay
in
the
street
i
sent
my
wife
home
by
coach
with
boy
and
myself
and
creed
in
the
coach
home
with
them
but
lord
the
fear
that
my
lady
paulina
was
in
every
step
of
the
way
and
indeed
at
this
time
of
the
night
it
was
no
safe
thing
to
go
that
road
so
that
i
was
even
afraid
myself
though
i
appeared
otherwise
we
come
safe
however
to
their
house
where
we
knocked
them
up
my
lady
and
all
the
family
being
in
bed
so
put
them
into
doors
and
leaving
them
with
the
maids
bade
them
good
night
the
talk
upon
the
is
that
de
ruyter
is
dead
with
fifty
men
of
his
own
ship
of
the
plague
at
cales
that
the
holland
embassador
here
do
endeavour
to
sweeten
us
with
fair
words
and
things
like
to
be
peaceable
i
to
the
duke
where
we
did
our
usual
business
and
among
other
discourse
of
the
dutch
he
was
merrily
saying
how
they
print
that
prince
rupert
duke
of
albemarle
and
my
lord
sandwich
are
to
be
generalls
and
soon
after
is
to
follow
them
vieux
pen
and
so
the
duke
called
him
in
mirth
old
pen
they
have
it
seems
lately
wrote
to
the
king
to
assure
him
that
their
ships
was
only
to
defend
their
and
to
stay
near
home
not
to
annoy
the
king
subjects
and
to
desire
that
he
would
do
the
like
with
his
ships
which
the
king
laughs
at
but
yet
is
troubled
they
should
think
him
such
a
child
to
suffer
them
to
bring
home
their
fish
and
east
india
company
ships
and
then
they
will
not
care
for
us
to
my
lord
lodgings
and
were
merry
with
the
young
ladies
who
made
a
great
story
of
their
appearing
before
their
mother
the
morning
after
we
carried
them
the
last
week
home
so
late
and
that
their
mother
took
it
very
well
at
least
without
any
anger
here
i
heard
how
the
rich
widow
my
lady
gold
is
married
to
one
neale
after
he
had
received
a
box
on
the
eare
by
her
brother
who
was
there
a
sentinel
in
behalf
of
some
courtier
at
the
door
but
made
him
draw
and
wounded
him
she
called
neale
up
to
her
and
sent
for
a
priest
married
presently
and
went
to
bed
the
brother
sent
to
the
court
and
had
a
serjeant
sent
for
neale
but
neale
sent
for
him
up
to
be
seen
in
bed
and
she
owned
him
for
her
husband
and
so
all
is
past
how
was
with
me
this
afternoon
to
desire
some
things
to
be
got
ready
for
my
lord
against
his
going
down
to
his
ship
which
will
be
soon
for
it
seems
the
king
and
both
the
queenes
intend
to
visit
him
the
lord
knows
how
my
lord
will
get
out
of
this
charge
for
moore
tells
me
that
he
is
in
debt
and
this
will
with
many
other
things
that
daily
will
grow
upon
him
while
he
minds
his
pleasure
as
he
do
set
him
further
backward
to
white
hall
and
pierce
showed
me
the
queene
bed
chamber
and
her
closet
where
she
had
nothing
but
some
pretty
pious
pictures
and
books
of
devotion
and
her
holy
water
at
her
head
as
she
sleeps
with
a
clock
by
her
wherein
a
lamp
burns
that
tells
her
the
time
of
the
night
at
any
time
thence
with
him
to
the
park
and
there
met
the
queene
coming
from
chapell
with
her
maids
of
honour
all
in
gowns
again
which
is
new
to
me
and
that
which
i
did
not
think
would
have
been
brought
up
again
thence
he
carried
me
to
the
closet
where
such
variety
of
pictures
and
other
things
of
value
and
rarity
that
i
was
properly
confounded
and
enjoyed
no
pleasure
in
the
sight
of
them
which
is
the
only
time
in
my
life
that
ever
i
was
so
at
a
loss
for
pleasure
in
the
greatest
plenty
of
objects
to
give
it
me
at
my
lord
sandwich
where
his
little
daughter
my
lady
catharine
was
brought
who
is
lately
come
from
my
father
at
brampton
to
have
her
cheeke
looked
after
which
is
and
hath
long
been
sore
but
my
lord
will
rather
have
it
be
as
it
is
with
a
scarr
in
her
face
than
endanger
it
being
worse
with
tampering
she
married
first
nicholas
son
and
heir
of
sir
bacon
and
secondly
the
rev
gardeman
and
lived
to
be
dying
july
this
day
the
king
and
the
queenes
went
to
visit
my
lord
sandwich
and
the
fleet
going
forth
in
the
hope
the
king
is
pretty
well
though
let
blood
the
night
before
yesterday
my
lady
sandwich
showed
us
my
lady
castlemaine
picture
finely
done
given
my
lord
and
a
most
beautiful
picture
it
is
there
is
a
beautiful
portrait
of
lady
castlemaine
in
the
room
at
hinchingbroke
to
my
lord
he
did
begin
with
a
most
solemn
profession
of
the
same
confidence
in
and
love
for
me
that
he
ever
had
and
then
told
me
what
a
misfortune
was
fallen
upon
me
and
him
in
me
by
a
displeasure
which
my
lord
chancellor
did
show
to
him
last
night
against
me
in
the
highest
and
most
passionate
manner
that
ever
any
man
did
speak
even
to
the
not
hearing
of
anything
to
be
said
to
him
but
he
told
me
that
he
did
say
all
that
could
be
said
for
a
man
as
to
my
faithfullnesse
and
duty
to
his
lordship
and
did
me
the
greatest
right
imaginable
and
what
should
the
business
be
but
that
i
should
be
forward
to
have
the
trees
in
clarendon
park
marked
and
cut
down
near
salisbury
granted
by
edward
vi
to
sir
herbert
earl
of
pembroke
for
two
lives
which
term
ended
in
when
it
reverted
to
the
crown
and
was
conferred
on
the
duke
of
albemarle
whose
family
as
i
imagine
got
back
the
estate
after
lord
clarendon
fall
for
according
to
britton
clarendon
park
was
alienated
by
christopher
second
duke
of
albemarle
to
the
earl
of
bath
from
whom
it
passed
by
purchase
to
bathurst
the
ancestor
of
the
present
possessor
which
he
it
seems
hath
bought
of
my
lord
albemarle
when
god
knows
i
am
the
most
innocent
man
in
the
world
in
it
and
did
nothing
of
myself
nor
knew
of
his
concernment
therein
but
barely
obeyed
my
lord
warrant
for
the
doing
thereof
and
said
that
i
did
most
with
him
and
had
justified
the
rogues
in
cutting
down
a
tree
of
his
and
that
i
had
sent
the
veriest
fanatique
that
is
in
england
to
mark
them
on
purpose
to
nose
him
all
which
i
did
assure
my
lord
was
most
properly
false
and
nothing
like
it
true
and
told
my
lord
the
whole
passage
my
lord
do
seem
most
nearly
affected
with
him
partly
i
believe
for
me
and
partly
for
himself
so
he
advised
me
to
wait
presently
upon
my
lord
and
clear
myself
in
the
most
perfect
manner
i
could
with
all
submission
and
assurance
that
i
am
his
creature
both
in
this
and
all
other
things
and
that
i
do
own
that
all
i
have
is
derived
through
my
lord
sandwich
from
his
lordship
so
full
of
horror
i
went
and
found
him
busy
in
trials
of
law
in
his
great
room
and
it
being
durst
not
stay
but
went
to
my
lord
and
told
him
so
whereupon
he
directed
me
to
take
him
after
dinner
and
so
away
i
home
leaving
my
lord
mightily
concerned
for
me
so
i
to
my
lord
chancellor
and
there
coming
out
after
dinner
i
accosted
him
telling
him
that
i
was
the
unhappy
pepys
that
had
fallen
into
his
high
displeasure
and
come
to
desire
him
to
give
me
leave
to
make
myself
better
understood
to
his
lordship
assuring
him
of
my
duty
and
service
he
answered
me
very
pleasingly
that
he
was
confident
upon
the
score
of
my
lord
sandwich
character
of
me
but
that
he
had
reason
to
think
what
he
did
and
desired
me
to
call
upon
him
some
evening
i
named
and
he
accepted
of
it
to
my
lord
chancellor
and
there
heard
several
trials
wherein
i
perceive
my
lord
is
a
most
able
and
ready
man
after
all
done
he
himself
called
come
pepys
you
and
i
will
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
so
he
was
led
down
stairs
having
the
goute
and
there
walked
with
me
i
think
above
an
hour
talking
most
friendly
yet
cunningly
i
told
him
clearly
how
things
were
how
ignorant
i
was
of
his
lordship
concernment
in
it
how
i
did
not
do
nor
say
one
word
singly
but
what
was
done
was
the
act
of
the
whole
board
he
told
me
by
name
that
he
was
more
angry
with
sir
carteret
than
with
me
and
also
with
the
whole
body
of
the
board
but
thinking
who
it
was
of
the
board
that
did
know
him
least
he
did
place
his
fear
upon
me
but
he
finds
that
he
is
indebted
to
none
of
his
friends
there
i
think
i
did
thoroughly
appease
him
till
he
thanked
me
for
my
desire
and
pains
to
satisfy
him
and
upon
my
desiring
to
be
directed
who
i
should
of
his
servants
advise
with
about
this
business
he
told
me
nobody
but
would
be
glad
to
hear
from
me
himself
he
told
me
he
would
not
direct
me
in
anything
that
it
might
not
be
said
that
the
lord
chancellor
did
labour
to
abuse
the
king
or
as
i
offered
direct
the
suspending
the
report
of
the
purveyors
but
i
see
what
he
means
and
will
make
it
my
work
to
do
him
service
in
it
but
lord
to
see
how
he
is
incensed
against
poor
deane
as
a
fanatick
rogue
and
i
know
not
what
and
what
he
did
was
done
in
spite
to
his
lordship
among
an
his
friends
and
tenants
he
did
plainly
say
that
he
would
not
direct
me
in
any
thing
for
he
would
not
put
himself
into
the
power
of
any
man
to
say
that
he
did
so
and
so
but
plainly
told
me
as
if
he
would
be
glad
i
did
something
lord
to
see
how
we
poor
wretches
dare
not
do
the
king
good
service
for
fear
of
the
greatness
of
these
men
he
named
sir
carteret
and
sir
minnes
and
the
rest
and
that
he
was
as
angry
with
them
all
as
me
but
it
was
pleasant
to
think
that
while
he
was
talking
to
me
comes
into
the
garden
sir
carteret
and
my
lord
avoided
speaking
with
him
and
made
him
and
many
others
stay
expecting
him
while
i
walked
up
and
down
above
an
hour
i
think
and
would
have
me
walk
with
my
hat
on
and
yet
after
all
there
has
been
so
little
ground
for
his
jealousy
of
me
that
i
am
sometimes
afraid
that
he
do
this
only
in
policy
to
bring
me
to
his
side
by
scaring
me
or
else
which
is
worse
to
try
how
faithfull
i
would
be
to
the
king
but
i
rather
think
the
former
of
the
two
i
parted
with
great
assurance
how
i
acknowledged
all
i
had
to
come
from
his
lordship
which
he
did
not
seem
to
refuse
but
with
great
kindness
and
respect
parted
up
and
to
my
lord
sandwich
where
he
sent
for
me
up
and
i
did
give
my
lord
an
account
of
what
had
passed
with
my
lord
chancellor
yesterday
with
which
he
was
pleased
and
advised
me
by
all
means
to
study
in
the
best
manner
i
could
to
serve
him
in
this
business
after
this
discourse
ended
he
began
to
tell
me
that
he
had
now
pitched
upon
his
day
of
going
to
sea
upon
monday
next
and
that
he
would
now
give
me
an
account
how
matters
are
with
him
he
told
me
that
his
work
now
in
the
world
is
only
to
keep
up
his
interest
at
court
having
little
hopes
to
get
more
considerably
he
saying
that
he
hath
now
about
per
annum
it
is
true
be
says
he
oweth
about
but
he
hath
been
at
great
charges
in
getting
things
to
this
pass
in
his
estate
besides
his
building
and
good
goods
that
he
hath
bought
he
says
that
he
hath
now
evened
his
reckonings
at
the
wardrobe
till
michaelmas
last
and
hopes
to
finish
it
to
before
he
goes
he
says
now
there
is
due
too
to
him
there
if
he
knew
how
to
get
it
paid
besides
that
montagu
do
owe
him
as
to
his
interest
he
says
that
he
hath
had
all
the
injury
done
him
that
ever
man
could
have
by
another
bosom
friend
that
knows
all
his
secrets
by
montagu
but
he
says
that
the
worst
of
it
all
is
past
and
he
gone
out
and
hated
his
very
person
by
the
king
and
he
believes
the
more
upon
the
score
of
his
carriage
to
him
nay
that
the
duke
of
york
did
say
a
little
while
since
in
his
closet
that
he
did
hate
him
because
of
his
ungrateful
carriage
to
my
lord
of
sandwich
he
says
that
he
is
as
great
with
the
chancellor
or
greater
than
ever
in
his
life
that
with
the
king
he
is
the
like
and
told
me
an
instance
that
whereas
he
formerly
was
of
the
private
council
to
the
king
before
he
was
last
sick
and
that
by
the
sickness
an
interruption
was
made
in
his
attendance
upon
him
the
king
did
not
constantly
call
him
as
he
used
to
do
to
his
private
council
only
in
businesses
of
the
sea
and
the
like
but
of
late
the
king
did
send
a
message
to
him
by
sir
harry
bennet
to
excuse
the
king
to
my
lord
that
he
had
not
of
late
sent
for
him
as
he
used
to
do
to
his
private
council
for
it
was
not
out
of
any
distaste
but
to
avoid
giving
offence
to
some
others
whom
he
did
not
name
but
my
lord
supposes
it
might
be
prince
rupert
or
it
may
be
only
that
the
king
would
rather
pass
it
by
an
excuse
than
be
thought
unkind
but
that
now
he
did
desire
him
to
attend
him
constantly
which
of
late
he
hath
done
and
the
king
never
more
kind
to
him
in
his
life
than
now
the
duke
of
york
as
much
as
is
possible
and
in
the
business
of
late
when
i
was
to
speak
to
my
lord
about
his
going
to
sea
he
says
that
he
finds
the
duke
did
it
with
the
greatest
ingenuity
and
love
in
the
world
and
whereas
says
my
lord
here
is
a
wise
man
hard
by
that
thinks
himself
so
and
it
may
be
is
in
a
degree
so
naming
by
and
by
my
lord
crewe
would
have
had
me
condition
with
him
that
neither
prince
rupert
nor
any
body
should
come
over
his
head
and
i
know
not
what
the
duke
himself
hath
caused
in
his
commission
that
he
be
made
admirall
of
this
and
what
other
ships
or
fleets
shall
hereafter
be
put
out
after
these
which
is
very
noble
he
tells
me
in
these
cases
and
that
of
montagu
and
all
others
he
finds
that
bearing
of
them
patiently
is
the
best
way
without
noise
or
trouble
and
things
wear
out
of
themselves
and
come
fair
again
but
says
he
takes
it
from
me
never
to
trust
too
much
to
any
man
in
the
world
for
you
put
yourself
into
his
power
and
the
best
seeming
friend
and
real
friend
as
to
the
present
may
have
or
take
occasion
to
fall
out
with
you
and
then
out
comes
all
then
he
told
me
of
sir
harry
bennet
though
they
were
always
kind
yet
now
it
is
become
to
an
acquaintance
and
familiarity
above
ordinary
that
for
these
months
he
hath
done
no
business
but
with
my
lord
advice
in
his
chamber
and
promises
all
faithfull
love
to
him
and
service
upon
all
occasions
my
lord
says
that
he
hath
the
advantage
of
being
able
by
his
experience
to
help
out
and
advise
him
and
he
believes
that
that
chiefly
do
invite
sir
harry
to
this
manner
of
treating
him
now
says
my
lord
the
only
and
the
greatest
embarras
that
i
have
in
the
world
is
how
to
behave
myself
to
sir
bennet
and
my
lord
chancellor
in
case
that
there
do
lie
any
thing
under
the
embers
about
my
lord
bristoll
which
nobody
can
tell
for
then
says
he
i
must
appear
for
one
or
other
and
i
will
lose
all
i
have
in
the
world
rather
than
desert
my
lord
chancellor
so
that
says
he
i
know
not
for
my
life
what
to
do
in
that
case
for
sir
bennet
love
is
come
to
the
height
and
his
confidence
that
he
hath
given
my
lord
a
character
a
cypher
and
will
oblige
my
lord
to
correspond
with
him
this
says
he
is
the
whole
condition
of
my
estate
and
interest
which
i
tell
you
because
i
know
not
whether
i
shall
see
you
again
or
no
then
as
to
the
voyage
he
thinks
it
will
be
of
charge
to
him
and
no
profit
but
that
he
must
not
now
look
after
nor
think
to
encrease
but
study
to
make
good
what
he
hath
that
what
is
due
to
him
from
the
wardrobe
or
elsewhere
may
be
paid
which
otherwise
would
fail
and
all
a
man
hath
be
but
small
content
to
him
so
we
seemed
to
take
leave
one
of
another
my
lord
of
me
desiring
me
that
i
would
write
to
him
and
give
him
information
upon
all
occasions
in
matters
that
concern
him
which
put
together
with
what
he
preambled
with
yesterday
makes
me
think
that
my
lord
do
truly
esteem
me
still
and
desires
to
preserve
my
service
to
him
which
i
do
bless
god
for
in
the
middle
of
our
discourse
my
lady
crewe
come
in
to
bring
my
lord
word
that
he
hath
another
son
my
lady
being
brought
to
bed
just
now
for
which
god
be
praised
and
send
my
lord
to
study
the
laying
up
of
something
the
more
thence
with
creed
to
james
and
missing
coventry
to
white
hall
where
staying
for
him
in
one
of
the
galleries
there
comes
out
of
the
stewart
in
a
most
lovely
form
with
her
hair
all
about
her
eares
having
her
picture
taken
there
there
was
the
king
and
twenty
more
i
think
standing
by
all
the
while
and
a
lovely
creature
she
in
the
dress
seemed
to
be
sir
cateret
and
i
did
talk
together
in
the
parke
about
my
lord
chancellor
business
of
the
timber
he
telling
me
freely
that
my
lord
chancellor
was
never
so
angry
with
him
in
all
his
life
as
he
was
for
this
business
and
in
a
great
passion
and
that
when
he
saw
me
there
he
knew
what
it
was
about
and
plots
now
with
me
how
we
may
serve
my
lord
which
i
am
mightily
glad
of
and
i
hope
together
we
may
do
it
thence
i
to
my
lord
chancellor
and
discoursed
his
business
with
him
i
perceive
and
he
says
plainly
that
he
will
not
have
any
man
to
have
it
in
his
power
to
say
that
my
lord
chancellor
did
contrive
the
wronging
the
king
of
his
timber
but
yet
i
perceive
he
would
be
glad
to
have
service
done
him
therein
and
told
me
sir
carteret
hath
told
him
that
he
and
i
would
look
after
his
business
to
see
it
done
in
the
best
manner
for
him
with
deane
discoursing
upon
the
business
of
my
lord
chancellor
timber
in
clarendon
park
and
how
to
make
a
report
therein
without
offending
him
which
at
last
i
drew
up
and
hope
it
will
please
him
but
i
would
to
god
neither
i
nor
he
ever
had
any
thing
to
have
done
with
it
to
white
hall
to
the
committee
for
fishing
but
nothing
done
it
being
a
great
day
there
upon
drawing
at
the
lottery
of
sir
arthur
slingsby
evelyn
says
this
lottery
was
a
shameful
imposition
i
got
in
and
stood
by
the
two
queenes
and
the
duchesse
of
york
and
just
behind
my
lady
castlemaine
whom
i
do
heartily
admire
and
good
sport
to
see
how
most
that
did
give
their
ten
pounds
did
go
away
with
a
pair
of
globes
only
for
their
lot
and
one
gentlewoman
one
mrs
fish
with
the
only
blanke
and
one
i
staid
to
see
draw
a
suit
of
hangings
valued
at
and
they
say
are
well
worth
the
money
or
near
it
one
other
suit
there
is
better
than
that
but
very
many
lots
of
three
and
pounds
i
observed
the
king
and
queene
did
get
but
as
poor
lots
as
any
else
but
the
wisest
man
i
met
with
was
cholmley
who
insured
as
many
as
would
from
drawing
of
the
one
blank
for
in
which
case
there
was
the
whole
number
of
persons
to
one
which
i
think
was
three
or
four
hundred
and
so
he
insured
about
for
shillings
so
that
he
could
not
have
lost
if
one
of
them
had
drawn
it
for
there
was
enough
to
pay
the
but
it
happened
another
drew
it
and
so
he
got
all
the
money
he
took
met
with
a
printed
copy
of
the
king
commission
for
the
repairs
of
paul
which
is
very
large
and
large
power
for
collecting
money
and
recovering
of
all
people
that
had
bought
or
sold
formerly
any
thing
belonging
to
the
church
no
news
only
the
plague
is
very
hot
still
and
encreases
among
the
dutch
great
discourse
of
the
fray
yesterday
in
moorefields
how
the
butchers
at
first
did
beat
the
weavers
between
whom
there
hath
been
ever
an
old
competition
for
mastery
but
at
last
the
weavers
rallied
and
beat
them
at
first
the
butchers
knocked
down
all
for
weavers
that
had
green
or
blue
aprons
till
they
were
fain
to
pull
them
off
and
put
them
in
their
breeches
at
last
the
butchers
were
fain
to
pull
off
their
sleeves
that
they
might
not
be
known
and
were
roundly
beaten
out
of
the
field
and
some
deeply
wounded
and
bruised
till
at
last
the
weavers
went
out
tryumphing
calling
for
a
butcher
i
am
overjoyed
in
hopes
that
upon
this
month
account
i
shall
find
myself
worth
besides
the
rich
present
of
two
silver
and
gilt
flaggons
which
gauden
did
give
me
the
other
day
my
lord
sandwich
newly
gone
to
sea
and
he
did
before
his
going
and
by
his
letter
since
show
me
all
manner
of
respect
and
confidence
to
the
where
great
talk
of
a
rich
present
brought
by
an
east
india
ship
from
some
of
the
princes
of
india
worth
to
the
king
in
two
precious
stones
august
to
the
and
there
all
the
house
full
of
the
victory
generall
soushe
who
is
a
frenchman
a
soldier
of
fortune
commanding
part
of
the
german
army
hath
had
against
the
turke
killing
men
and
taking
most
extraordinary
spoil
to
the
king
and
there
saw
bartholomew
fayre
which
do
still
please
me
and
is
as
it
is
acted
the
best
comedy
in
the
world
i
believe
i
chanced
to
sit
by
tom
killigrew
who
tells
me
that
he
is
setting
up
a
nursery
that
is
is
going
to
build
a
house

moorefields
wherein
he
will
have

plays
acted
but
four
operas

shall
have
in
the
year
to
act
six
weeks
at
a
time
where
we
shall
have
the
best
scenes
and
machines
the
best
musique
and
everything
as
magnificent
as
is
in
christendome
and
to
that
end
hath
sent
for
voices
and
painters
and
other
persons
from
italy
thence
homeward
called
upon
my
lord
marlborough
to
a
play
at
the
king
house
the
rivall
ladys
a
tragedy
by
dryden
a
very
innocent
and
meet
pretty
witty
play
i
was
much
pleased
with
it
and
it
being
given
me
his
companion
paid
for
him
i
look
upon
it
as
no
breach
of
my
oath
here
we
hear
that
clun
one
of
their
best
actors
was
the
last
night
going
out
of
towne
after
he
had
acted
the
alchymist
wherein
was
one
of
his
best
parts
that
he
acts
to
his
set
upon
and
murdered
one
of
the
rogues
taken
an
irish
fellow
it
seems
most
cruelly
butchered
and
bound
the
house
will
have
a
great
miss
of
him
thence
visited
my
lady
sandwich
who
tells
me
my
lord
fitzharding
is
to
be
made
a
marquis
about
ten
i
dressed
myself
and
so
mounted
upon
a
very
pretty
mare
sent
me
by
sir
warren
according
to
his
promise
yesterday
and
so
through
the
city
not
a
little
proud
god
knows
to
be
seen
upon
so
pretty
a
beast
and
to
my
cosen
joyce
who
presently
mounted
too
and
he
and
i
out
of
towne
toward
highgate
in
the
way
at
he
showing
me
the
place
and
manner
of
clun
being
killed
and
laid
in
a
ditch
and
yet
was
not
killed
by
any
wounds
having
only
one
in
his
arm
but
bled
to
death
through
his
struggling
he
told
me
also
the
manner
of
it
of
his
going
home
so
late
drinking
with
his
mistress
and
manner
of
having
it
found
out
i
saw
several
poor
creatures
carried
by
by
constables
for
being
at
a
conventicle
they
go
like
lambs
without
any
resistance
i
would
to
god
they
would
either
conform
or
be
more
wise
and
not
be
catched
this
day
come
the
news
that
the
emperour
hath
beat
the
turke
killed
the
grand
vizier
and
several
great
bassas
with
an
army
of
men
killed
and
routed
with
some
considerable
loss
of
his
own
side
having
lost
three
generals
and
the
french
forces
all
cut
off
almost
which
is
thought
as
good
a
service
to
the
emperour
as
beating
the
turke
almost
abroad
to
find
out
one
to
engrave
my
tables
upon
my
new
sliding
rule
with
silver
plates
it
being
so
small
that
browne
that
made
it
can
not
get
one
to
do
it
so
i
got
cocker
edward
cocker
the
well
known
and
arithmetician
ob
circ
the
famous
to
do
it
and
i
set
an
hour
by
him
to
see
him
design
it
all
and
strange
it
is
to
see
him
with
his
natural
eyes
to
cut
so
small
at
his
first
designing
it
and
read
it
all
over
without
any
missing
when
for
my
life
i
could
not
with
my
best
skill
read
one
word
or
letter
of
it
but
it
is
use
he
says
that
the
best
light
for
his
life
to
do
a
very
small
thing
by
contrary
to
chaucer
words
to
the
sun
that
he
should
lend
his
light
to
them
that
small
seals
grave
it
should
be
by
an
artificial
light
of
a
candle
set
to
advantage
as
he
could
do
it
i
find
the
fellow
by
his
discourse
very
ingenious
and
among
other
things
a
great
admirer
and
well
read
in
the
english
poets
and
undertakes
to
judge
of
them
all
and
that
not
impertinently
comes
cocker
with
my
rule
which
he
hath
engraved
to
admiration
for
goodness
and
smallness
of
work
it
cost
me
the
doing
this
day
for
a
wager
before
the
king
my
lords
of
castlehaven
and
arran
a
son
of
my
lord
of
ormond
they
two
alone
did
run
down
and
kill
a
stoute
bucke
in
james
parke
to
the
new
play
at
the
duke
house
of
henry
the
fifth
a
most
noble
play
writ
by
my
lord
orrery
wherein
betterton
harris
and
ianthe
parts
most
incomparably
wrote
and
done
and
the
whole
play
the
most
full
of
height
and
raptures
of
wit
and
sense
that
ever
i
heard
having
but
one
incongruity
that
king
harry
promises
to
plead
for
tudor
to
their
mistress
princesse
katherine
of
france
more
than
when
it
comes
to
it
he
seems
to
do
and
tudor
refused
by
her
with
some
kind
of
indignity
not
with
a
difficulty
and
honour
that
it
ought
to
have
been
done
in
to
him
with
sir
minnes
he
talking
of
his
cures
abroad
while
he
was
with
the
king
as
a
doctor
and
among
others
sir
benham
he
told
me
he
had
cured
to
a
miracle
at
charing
cross
and
there
saw
the
great
dutchman
that
is
come
over
under
whose
arm
i
went
with
my
hat
on
and
could
not
reach
higher
than
his
eyebrowes
with
the
tip
of
my
fingers
he
is
a
comely
and
made
man
and
his
wife
a
very
little
but
pretty
comely
dutch
woman
wakened
about
two
this
morning
with
a
noise
of
thunder
which
lasted
for
an
hour
with
such
continued
lightnings
not
flashes
but
flames
that
all
the
sky
and
ayre
was
light
and
that
for
a
great
while
not
a
minute
space
between
new
flames
all
the
time
such
a
thing
as
i
never
did
see
nor
could
have
believed
had
even
been
in
nature
and
being
put
into
a
great
sweat
with
it
could
not
sleep
till
all
was
over
and
that
accompanied
with
such
a
storm
of
rain
as
i
never
heard
in
my
life
i
expected
to
find
my
house
in
the
morning
overflowed
but
i
find
not
one
drop
of
rain
in
my
house
nor
any
news
of
hurt
done
pierce
tells
me
the
king
do
still
sup
every
night
with
my
lady
castlemaine
the
news
of
the
emperour
victory
over
the
turkes
is
by
some
doubted
but
by
most
confessed
to
be
very
small
though
great
of
what
was
talked
which
was
men
to
be
killed
and
taken
of
the
turke
side
i
walked
to
cheapside
to
see
the
effect
of
a
fire
there
this
morning
since
four
which
i
find
in
the
house
of
bois
that
married
doctor
fuller
niece
who
are
both
out
of
town
leaving
only
a
maid
and
man
in
town
it
begun
in
their
house
and
hath
burned
much
and
many
houses
backward
though
none
forward
and
that
in
the
great
uniform
pile
of
buildings
in
the
middle
of
cheapside
i
am
very
sorry
for
them
for
the
sake
thence
to
the
and
so
home
to
dinner
and
thence
to
sir
batten
whither
sir
richard
ford
come
the
sheriffe
who
hath
been
at
this
fire
all
the
while
and
he
tells
me
upon
my
question
that
he
and
the
mayor
sir
john
robinson
were
there
as
it
is
their
dutys
to
be
not
only
to
keep
the
peace
but
they
have
power
of
commanding
the
pulling
down
of
any
house
or
houses
to
defend
the
city
by
and
by
comes
in
the
common
cryer
of
the
city
to
speak
with
him
and
when
he
was
gone
says
he
you
may
see
by
this
man
the
constitution
of
the
magistracy
of
this
city
that
this
fellow
place
i
dare
give
him
if
he
will
be
true
to
me
for
his
profits
every
year
and
expect
to
get
more
to
myself
thereby
when
says
he
i
in
myself
am
forced
to
spend
many
times
as
much
to
see
some
pictures
at
one
hiseman
huysman
a
a
dutchman
which
is
said
to
exceed
lilly
and
indeed
there
is
both
of
the
queenes
and
maids
or
honour
particularly
stewart
in
a
buff
doublet
like
a
soldier
still
to
be
seen
at
kensington
palace
as
good
pictures
i
think
as
ever
i
saw
the
queene
is
drawn
in
one
like
a
shepherdess
in
the
other
like
katharin
most
like
and
most
admirably
i
was
mightily
pleased
with
this
sight
indeed
mr
pen
sir
william
son
is
come
back
from
france
and
come
to
visit
my
wife
a
most
modish
person
grown
she
says
a
fine
gentleman
all
the
news
this
day
is
that
the
dutch
are
with
two
sail
of
ships
of
warr
crewsing
up
and
down
about
ostend
at
which
we
are
alarmed
my
lord
sandwich
is
come
back
into
the
downes
with
only
eight
sail
which
is
or
may
be
a
prey
to
the
dutch
if
they
knew
our
weakness
and
inability
to
set
out
any
more
speedily
prince
rupert
i
hear
this
day
is
to
go
to
command
this
fleet
going
to
guinny
against
the
dutch
i
doubt
few
will
be
pleased
with
his
going
being
accounted
an
unhappy
man
september
with
the
duke
where
all
our
discourse
of
war
in
the
highest
measure
prince
rupert
was
with
us
who
is
fitting
himself
to
go
to
sea
in
the
heneretta
and
afterwards
i
met
him
and
gray
and
says
he
i
can
answer
but
for
one
ship
and
in
that
i
will
do
my
part
for
it
is
not
in
that
as
in
the
army
where
a
man
can
command
every
thing
this
day
coventry
did
tell
us
how
the
duke
did
receive
the
dutch
embassador
the
other
day
by
telling
him
that
whereas
they
think
us
in
jest
he
believes
that
the
prince
rupert
which
goes
in
this
fleet
to
guinny
will
soon
tell
them
that
we
are
in
earnest
and
that
he
himself
will
do
the
like
here
in
the
head
of
the
fleet
here
at
home
and
that
he
did
not
doubt
to
live
to
see
the
dutch
as
fearfull
of
provoking
the
english
under
the
government
of
a
king
as
he
remembers
there
to
have
been
under
that
of
a
coquin
with
blagrave
walking
in
the
abbey
he
telling
me
the
whole
government
and
discipline
of
white
hall
chapel
and
the
caution
now
used
against
admitting
any
debauched
persons
up
and
to
my
cosen
anthony
joyce
and
there
took
leave
of
my
aunt
james
and
both
cosens
their
wives
who
are
this
day
going
down
to
my
father
by
coach
i
did
give
my
aunt
to
carry
as
a
token
to
my
mother
and
to
poll
his
sister
paulina
with
the
duke
and
saw
him
with
great
pleasure
play
with
his
little
girle
like
an
ordinary
private
father
of
a
child
pierce
tells
me
when
i
was
wondering
that
fraizer
should
order
things
with
the
prince
in
that
confident
manner
that
fraizer
is
so
great
with
my
lady
castlemaine
and
stewart
and
all
the
ladies
at
court
in
helping
to
slip
their
calfes
when
there
is
occasion
and
with
the
great
men
in
curing
of
them
that
he
can
do
what
he
please
with
the
king
in
spite
of
any
man
and
upon
the
same
score
with
the
prince
they
all
having
more
or
less
occasion
to
make
use
of
him
home
having
got
a
strange
cold
in
my
head
by
flinging
off
my
hat
at
dinner
and
sitting
with
the
wind
in
my
neck
in
lord
clarendon
essay
on
the
decay
of
respect
paid
to
age
he
says
that
in
his
younger
days
he
never
kept
his
hat
on
before
those
older
than
himself
except
at
dinner
we
were
told
of
a
dutch
ship
of
or
tons
where
all
the
men
were
dead
of
the
plague
and
the
ship
cast
ashore
at
gottenburgh
fresh
newes
come
of
our
beating
the
dutch
at
guinny
quite
out
of
all
their
castles
almost
which
will
make
them
quite
mad
here
at
home
sure
and
sir
carteret
did
tell
me
that
the
king
do
joy
mightily
at
it
but
asked
him
laughing
but
says
he
how
shall
i
do
to
answer
this
to
the
embassador
when
he
comes
nay
they
say
that
we
have
beat
them
out
of
the
new
netherlands
too
so
that
we
have
been
doing
them
mischief
for
a
great
while
in
several
parts
of
the
world
without
publick
knowledge
or
reason
their
fleete
for
guinny
is
now
they
say
ready
and
abroad
and
will
be
going
this
week
october
we
go
now
on
with
vigour
in
preparing
against
the
dutch
who
they
say
will
now
fall
upon
us
without
doubt
upon
this
high
news
come
of
our
beating
them
so
wholly
in
guinny
after
church
i
walked
to
my
lady
sandwich
through
my
lord
southampton
new
buildings
in
the
fields
behind
gray
inn
and
indeed
they
are
a
very
great
and
a
noble
work
with
sir
minnes
by
coach
to
james
and
there
all
the
news
now
of
very
hot
preparations
for
the
dutch
and
being
with
the
duke
he
told
us
he
was
resolved
to
take
a
tripp
himself
and
that
sir
pen
should
go
in
the
same
ship
with
him
which
honour
god
forgive
me
i
could
grudge
him
for
his
knavery
and
dissimulation
though
i
do
not
envy
much
the
having
the
same
place
myself
talk
also
of
great
haste
in
the
getting
out
another
fleet
and
building
some
ships
and
now
it
is
likely
we
have
put
one
another
dalliance
past
a
retreate
after
dinner
to
a
play
to
see
the
generall
which
is
so
dull
and
so
that
i
think
it
is
the
worst
i
ever
saw
or
heard
in
all
my
days
i
happened
to
sit
near
to
sir
charles
sedley
who
i
find
a
very
witty
man
and
he
did
at
every
line
take
notice
of
the
dullness
of
the
poet
and
badness
of
the
action
that
most
pertinently
which
i
was
mightily
taken
with
to
the
at
the
where
i
was
once
before
and
thither
anon
come
all
the
gresham
college
and
a
great
deal
of
noble
company
and
the
new
instrument
was
brought
called
the
arched
viall
where
being
tuned
with
and
played
on
with
kees
like
an
organ
a
piece
of
parchment
is
always
kept
moving
and
the
strings
which
by
the
kees
are
pressed
down
upon
it
are
grated
in
imitation
of
a
bow
by
the
parchment
and
so
it
is
intended
to
resemble
several
vyalls
played
on
with
one
bow
but
so
basely
and
so
harshly
that
it
will
never
do
but
after
three
hours
stay
it
could
not
be
fixed
in
tune
and
so
they
were
fain
to
go
to
some
other
musique
of
instruments
this
morning
by
three
the
prince
rupert
and
king
and
duke
with
him
went
down
the
river
and
the
prince
under
sail
the
next
tide
after
and
so
is
gone
from
the
hope
god
give
him
better
success
than
he
used
to
have
this
day
by
the
blessing
of
god
my
wife
and
i
have
been
married
nine
years
but
my
head
being
full
of
business
i
did
not
think
of
it
to
keep
it
in
any
extraordinary
manner
but
bless
god
for
our
long
lives
and
loves
and
health
together
which
the
same
god
long
continue
i
wish
from
my
very
heart
luellin
tells
me
what
an
obscene
loose
play
this
wedding
a
comedy
by
thomas
killigrew
is
that
is
acted
by
nothing
but
women
at
the
king
house
my
wife
tells
me
the
sad
news
of
my
lady
castlemaine
being
now
become
so
decayed
that
one
would
not
know
her
at
least
far
from
a
beauty
which
i
am
sorry
for
this
day
with
great
joy
captain
titus
told
us
the
particulars
of
the
french
expedition
against
gigery
upon
the
barbary
coast
in
the
straights
with
chosen
men
they
have
taken
the
fort
of
gigery
wherein
were
five
men
and
three
guns
which
makes
the
whole
story
of
the
king
of
france
policy
and
power
to
be
laughed
at
for
news
all
say
de
ruyter
is
gone
to
guinny
before
us
sir
lawson
is
come
to
portsmouth
and
our
fleet
is
hastening
all
speed
i
mean
this
new
fleet
prince
rupert
with
his
is
got
into
the
downes
in
my
way
to
brampton
in
this
day
journey
i
met
with
white
cromwell
chaplin
that
was
and
had
a
great
deal
of
discourse
with
him
among
others
he
tells
me
that
richard
is
and
hath
long
been
in
france
and
is
now
going
into
italy
he
owns
publickly
that
he
do
correspond
and
return
him
all
his
money
that
richard
hath
been
in
some
straits
in
the
beginning
but
relieved
by
his
friends
that
he
goes
by
another
name
but
do
not
disguise
himself
nor
deny
himself
to
any
man
that
challenges
him
he
tells
me
for
certain
that
offers
had
been
made
to
the
old
man
of
marriage
between
the
king
and
his
daughter
to
have
obliged
him
but
he
would
not
he
thinks
with
me
that
it
never
was
in
his
power
to
bring
in
the
king
with
the
consent
of
any
of
his
officers
about
him
and
that
he
scorned
to
bring
him
in
as
monk
did
to
secure
himself
and
deliver
every
body
else
when
i
told
him
of
what
i
found
writ
in
a
french
book
of
one
monsieur
sorbiere
samuel
sorbiere
who
after
studying
divinity
and
medicine
at
paris
travelled
in
different
parts
of
europe
and
published
his
voyage
into
england
described
by
voltaire
as
a
dull
scurrilous
satyr
upon
a
nation
of
which
the
author
knew
nothing
that
gives
an
account
of
his
observations
here
in
england
among
other
things
he
says
that
it
is
reported
that
cromwell
did
in
his
transpose
many
of
the
bodies
of
the
kings
of
england
from
one
grave
to
another
and
that
by
that
means
it
is
not
known
certainly
whether
the
head
that
is
now
set
up
upon
a
post
be
that
of
cromwell
or
of
one
of
the
kings
white
tells
me
that
be
believes
he
never
had
so
poor
a
low
thought
in
him
to
trouble
himself
about
it
he
says
the
hand
of
god
is
much
to
be
seen
that
all
his
children
are
in
good
condition
enough
as
to
estate
and
that
their
relations
that
betrayed
their
family
are
all
now
either
hanged
or
very
miserable
my
father
and
i
up
and
walked
alone
to
hinchingbroke
and
among
the
late
chargeable
works
that
my
lord
hath
done
there
we
saw
his
which
are
very
fine
and
so
is
the
house
all
over
but
i
am
sorry
to
think
of
the
money
at
this
time
spent
therein
lord
day
it
raining
we
set
out
betimes
and
about
nine
got
to
hatfield
in
and
i
light
and
saw
my
simple
lord
salsbury
sit
there
in
the
gallery
at
i
saw
the
queene
new
rooms
which
are
most
stately
and
nobly
furnished
and
there
i
saw
her
and
the
duke
of
york
and
duchesse
the
duke
espied
me
and
come
to
me
and
talked
with
me
a
very
great
while
into
the
galleries
at
white
hall
to
talk
with
my
lord
sandwich
among
other
things
about
the
prince
writing
up
to
tell
us
of
the
danger
he
and
his
fleet
lie
in
at
portsmouth
of
receiving
affronts
from
the
dutch
which
my
lord
said
he
would
never
have
done
had
he
lain
there
with
one
ship
alone
nor
is
there
any
great
reason
for
it
because
of
the
sands
however
the
fleet
will
be
ordered
to
go
and
lay
themselves
up
at
the
cowes
much
beneath
the
prowesse
of
the
prince
i
think
and
the
honour
of
the
nation
at
the
first
to
be
found
to
secure
themselves
my
lord
is
well
pleased
to
think
that
if
the
duke
and
the
prince
go
all
the
blame
of
any
miscarriage
will
not
light
on
him
and
that
if
any
thing
goes
well
he
hopes
he
shall
have
the
share
of
the
glory
for
the
prince
is
by
no
means
well
esteemed
of
by
any
body
this
day
the
great
died
i
believe
to
the
content
of
all
the
protestant
pretenders
in
ireland
at
woolwich
i
there
up
to
the
king
and
duke
here
i
staid
above
with
them
while
the
ship
was
launched
which
was
done
with
great
success
and
the
king
did
very
much
like
the
ship
saying
she
had
the
best
bow
that
ever
he
saw
but
lord
the
sorry
talk
and
discourse
among
the
great
courtiers
round
about
him
without
any
reverence
in
the
world
but
with
so
much
disorder
by
and
by
the
queene
comes
and
her
maids
of
honour
one
whereof
boynton
daughter
of
matthew
second
son
to
sir
matthew
boynton
of
barnston
yorkshire
she
became
the
first
wife
of
richard
talbot
afterwards
duke
of
tyrconnel
and
the
duchesse
of
buckingham
had
been
very
sick
coming
by
water
in
the
barge
the
water
being
very
rough
but
what
silly
sport
they
made
with
them
in
very
common
terms
methought
was
very
poor
and
below
what
people
think
these
great
people
say
and
do
the
launching
being
done
the
king
and
company
went
down
to
take
barge
and
i
sent
for
pett
he
had
built
the
ship
and
put
the
flaggon
into
the
duke
hand
and
he
in
the
presence
of
the
king
did
give
it
pett
taking
it
upon
his
knee
the
city
did
last
night
very
freely
lend
the
king
without
any
security
but
the
king
word
which
was
very
noble
all
the
talk
is
that
de
ruyter
is
come
home
with
six
or
eight
of
his
captaines
to
command
here
at
home
and
their
ships
kept
abroad
in
the
straights
which
sounds
as
if
they
had
a
mind
to
do
something
with
us
this
day
i
hear
young
stanly
a
brave
young
gentleman
that
went
out
with
young
jermin
with
prince
rupert
is
already
dead
of
the
at
portsmouth
all
preparations
against
the
dutch
and
the
duke
of
york
fitting
himself
with
all
speed
to
go
to
the
fleet
which
is
hastening
for
him
being
now
resolved
to
go
in
the
charles
november
to
the
duke
house
to
see
macbeth
a
pretty
good
play
but
admirably
acted
thence
home
the
coach
being
forced
to
go
round
by
london
wall
home
because
of
the
bonfires
the
day
being
mightily
observed
in
the
city
at
noon
i
and
sir
minnes
and
lord
barkeley
who
with
sir
duncum
for
bury
st
edmunds
and
chichly
are
made
masters
of
the
ordnance
to
the
office
of
the
ordnance
to
discourse
about
wadding
for
guns
thence
to
dinner
all
of
us
to
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
where
a
good
dinner
but
disturbed
in
the
middle
of
it
by
the
king
coming
into
the
tower
and
so
we
broke
up
and
to
him
and
went
up
and
down
the
and
magazines
which
are
with
the
addition
of
the
new
great
storehouse
a
noble
sight
to
white
hall
and
there
the
king
being
in
his
cabinet
council
i
desiring
to
speak
with
sir
carteret
i
was
called
in
and
demanded
by
the
king
himself
many
questions
to
which
i
did
give
him
full
answers
there
were
at
this
council
my
lord
chancellor
archbishop
of
canterbury
lord
treasurer
the
two
secretarys
and
sir
carteret
not
a
little
contented
at
this
chance
of
being
made
known
to
these
persons
and
called
often
by
my
name
by
the
king
the
duke
of
york
is
this
day
gone
away
to
portsmouth
a
gentleman
told
us
he
saw
the
other
day
and
did
bring
the
draught
of
it
to
sir
francis
prigeon
a
monster
born
of
an
hostler
wife
at
salsbury
two
women
children
perfectly
made
joyned
at
the
lower
part
of
their
bellies
and
every
part
perfect
as
two
bodies
and
only
one
payre
of
legs
coming
forth
on
one
side
from
the
middle
where
they
were
joined
it
was
alive
hours
and
cried
and
did
as
all
hopefull
children
do
but
being
showed
too
much
to
people
was
killed
to
the
council
at
white
hall
where
a
great
many
lords
annesly
in
the
chair
but
lord
to
see
what
work
they
will
make
us
and
what
trouble
we
shall
have
to
inform
men
in
a
business
they
are
to
begin
to
know
when
the
greatest
of
our
hurry
is
is
a
thing
to
be
lamented
and
i
fear
the
consequence
will
be
bad
to
us
put
on
my
new
shaggy
purple
gown
with
gold
buttons
and
loop
lace
up
and
with
sir
batten
to
white
hall
to
the
lords
of
the
admiralty
and
there
did
our
business
betimes
thence
to
sir
philip
warwick
about
navy
business
and
my
lord
ashly
and
afterwards
to
my
lord
chancellor
who
is
very
well
pleased
with
me
and
my
carrying
of
his
business
and
so
to
the
where
mighty
busy
and
so
home
to
dinner
where
creed
and
moore
and
after
dinner
i
to
my
lord
treasurer
to
sir
philip
warwick
there
and
then
to
white
hall
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
about
tangier
and
then
homeward
to
the
to
hear
news
and
it
seems
the
dutch
as
i
afterwards
found
by
coventry
letters
have
stopped
a
ship
of
masts
of
sir
warren
coming
for
us
in
a
swede
ship
which
they
will
not
release
upon
sir
downing
claiming
her
which
appears
as
the
first
act
of
hostility
and
is
looked
upon
as
so
by
coventry
the
elias
coming
from
new
england
captain
hill
commander
is
sunk
only
the
captain
and
a
few
men
saved
she
foundered
in
the
sea
this
day
for
certain
news
is
come
that
teddiman
hath
brought
in
eighteen
or
twenty
dutchmen
merchants
their
bourdeaux
fleet
and
two
men
of
warr
to
portsmouth
and
i
had
letters
this
afternoon
that
three
are
brought
into
the
downes
and
dover
so
that
the
warr
is
begun
god
give
a
good
end
to
it
to
my
lord
treasurer
where
with
sir
philip
warwick
studying
all
we
could
to
make
the
last
year
swell
as
high
as
we
could
and
it
is
much
to
see
how
he
do
study
for
the
king
to
do
it
to
get
all
the
money
from
the
parliament
he
can
and
i
shall
be
serviceable
to
him
therein
to
help
him
to
heads
upon
which
to
enlarge
the
report
of
the
expence
he
did
observe
to
me
how
obedient
this
parliament
was
for
a
while
and
the
last
session
how
they
began
to
differ
and
to
carp
at
the
king
officers
and
what
they
will
do
now
he
says
is
to
make
agreement
for
the
money
for
there
is
no
guess
to
be
made
of
it
he
told
me
he
was
prepared
to
convince
the
parliament
that
the
subsidys
are
a
most
ridiculous
tax
the
four
last
not
rising
to
and
unequall
he
talks
of
a
tax
of
assessment
of
for
five
years
the
people
to
be
secured
that
it
shall
continue
no
longer
than
there
is
really
a
warr
and
the
charges
thereof
to
be
paid
he
told
me
that
one
year
of
the
late
dutch
war
cost
thence
to
my
lord
chancellor
and
there
staid
long
with
sir
batten
and
sir
minnes
to
speak
with
my
lord
about
our
prize
office
business
but
being
sick
and
full
of
visitants
we
could
not
speak
with
him
and
so
away
home
where
sir
richard
ford
did
meet
us
with
letters
from
holland
this
day
that
it
is
likely
the
dutch
fleet
will
not
come
out
this
year
they
have
not
victuals
to
keep
them
out
and
it
is
likely
they
will
be
frozen
before
they
can
get
back
captain
cocke
is
made
steward
for
sick
and
wounded
seamen
sir
carteret
was
here
this
afternoon
and
strange
to
see
how
we
plot
to
make
the
charge
of
this
war
to
appear
greater
than
it
is
because
of
getting
money
at
my
office
all
the
morning
to
prepare
an
account
of
the
charge
we
have
been
put
to
extraordinary
by
the
dutch
already
and
i
have
brought
it
to
appear
but
god
knows
this
is
only
a
scare
to
the
parliament
to
make
them
give
the
more
money
thence
to
the
parliament
house
and
there
did
give
it
to
sir
philip
warwick
the
house
being
hot
upon
giving
the
king
a
supply
of
money
jenings
tells
me
the
mean
manner
that
sir
samuel
morland
lives
near
him
in
a
house
he
hath
bought
and
laid
out
money
upon
in
all
to
the
value
of
but
is
believed
to
be
a
beggar
at
sir
batten
i
hear
that
the
house
have
given
the
king
to
be
paid
for
this
war
only
for
the
navy
in
three
years
time
which
is
a
joyful
thing
to
all
the
party
i
see
but
was
much
opposed
by
vaughan
and
others
that
it
should
be
so
much
certain
news
of
our
peace
made
by
captain
allen
with
argier
and
that
the
dutch
have
sent
part
of
their
fleet
round
by
scotland
and
resolve
to
pay
off
the
rest
promising
the
rest
in
the
spring
hereby
keeping
their
men
but
how
true
this
i
know
not
december
the
duke
of
york
is
expected
with
great
joy
from
portsmouth
after
his
having
been
abroad
at
sea
three
or
four
days
with
the
fleet
and
the
dutch
are
all
drawn
into
their
harbours
but
it
seems
like
a
victory
and
a
matter
of
some
reputation
to
us
it
is
and
blemish
to
them
but
in
no
degree
like
what
it
is
esteemed
at
the
weather
requiring
them
to
do
so
up
and
to
white
hall
with
sir
minnes
and
there
among
an
infinite
crowd
of
great
persons
did
kiss
the
duke
hand
but
had
no
time
to
discourse
to
the
old
exchange
and
there
hear
that
the
dutch
are
fitting
their
ships
out
again
which
puts
us
to
new
discourse
and
to
alter
our
thoughts
of
the
dutch
as
to
their
want
of
courage
or
force
it
seems
of
all
mankind
there
is
no
man
so
led
by
another
as
the
duke
is
by
lord
muskerry
eldest
son
of
the
earl
of
cloncarty
he
had
served
with
distinction
in
flanders
as
colonel
of
an
infantry
regiment
and
was
killed
on
board
the
duke
of
york
ship
in
the
sea
fight
and
this
fitzharding
insomuch
as
when
the
king
would
have
him
to
be
the
duke
wept
and
said
but
sir
i
must
have
your
promise
if
you
will
have
my
dear
charles
from
me
that
if
ever
you
have
an
occasion
for
an
army
again
i
may
have
him
with
me
believing
him
to
be
the
best
commander
of
an
army
in
the
world
but
cholmly
thinks
as
all
other
men
i
meet
with
do
that
he
is
a
very
ordinary
fellow
it
is
strange
how
the
duke
also
do
love
naturally
and
affect
the
irish
above
the
english
he
of
the
company
he
carried
with
him
to
sea
took
above
two
thirds
irish
and
french
he
tells
me
the
king
do
hate
my
lord
chancellor
and
that
they
that
is
the
king
and
lord
fitzharding
do
laugh
at
him
for
a
dull
fellow
and
in
all
this
business
of
the
dutch
war
do
nothing
by
his
advice
hardly
consulting
him
only
he
is
a
good
minister
in
other
respects
and
the
king
can
not
be
without
him
but
above
all
being
the
duke
he
is
kept
in
otherwise
fitzharding
were
able
to
fling
down
two
of
him
this
all
the
wise
and
grave
lords
see
and
can
not
help
it
but
yield
to
it
but
he
bemoans
what
the
end
of
it
may
be
the
king
being
ruled
by
these
men
as
he
hath
been
all
along
since
his
coming
to
the
rasing
all
the
in
scotland
and
giving
liberty
to
the
irish
in
ireland
whom
cromwell
had
settled
all
in
one
corner
who
are
now
able
and
it
is
feared
every
day
a
massacre
beginning
among
them
mighty
talk
there
is
of
this
comet
that
is
seen
and
the
king
and
queene
did
sit
up
last
night
to
see
it
and
did
it
seems
and
i
thought
to
have
done
so
too
but
it
is
cloudy
and
so
no
stars
appear
but
i
will
endeavour
it
gray
did
tell
me
for
certain
that
the
dutch
as
high
as
they
seem
do
begin
to
buckle
and
that
one
man
in
this
kingdom
did
tell
the
king
that
he
is
offered
to
make
a
peace
and
others
have
been
offered
money
also
it
seems
the
taking
of
their
bourdeaux
fleet
thus
arose
from
a
printed
gazette
of
the
dutch
boasting
of
fighting
and
having
beaten
the
english
in
confidence
whereof
it
coming
to
bourdeaux
all
the
fleet
comes
out
and
so
falls
into
our
hands
with
sir
minnes
to
white
hall
and
there
we
waited
on
the
duke
and
among
other
things
coventry
took
occasion
to
vindicate
himself
before
the
duke
and
us
being
ill
there
about
the
choosing
of
taylor
for
harwich
silas
taylor
storekeeper
at
harwich
upon
which
the
duke
did
clear
him
and
did
tell
us
that
he
did
expect
that
after
he
had
named
a
man
none
of
us
shall
then
oppose
or
find
fault
with
the
man
but
if
we
had
any
thing
to
say
we
ought
to
say
it
before
he
had
chose
him
sir
carteret
thought
himself
concerned
and
endeavoured
to
clear
himself
and
by
and
by
sir
batten
did
speak
knowing
himself
guilty
and
did
confess
that
being
pressed
by
the
council
he
did
say
what
he
did
that
he
was
accounted
a
fanatique
but
did
not
know
that
at
that
time
he
had
been
appointed
by
his
royal
highness
to
which
the
duke
that
it
was
impossible
but
he
must
know
that
he
had
appointed
him
and
so
it
did
appear
that
the
duke
did
mean
all
this
while
sir
batten
my
lord
sandwich
this
day
writes
me
word
that
he
hath
seen
at
portsmouth
the
comet
and
says
it
is
the
most
extraordinary
thing
he
ever
saw
met
with
a
copy
of
verses
mightily
commended
by
some
gentlemen
there
of
my
lord
mordaunt
vide
note
in
excuse
of
his
going
to
sea
this
late
expedition
with
the
duke
of
york
but
lord
they
are
sorry
things
only
a
lord
made
them
thence
to
the
and
there
among
the
merchants
i
hear
fully
the
news
of
our
being
beaten
to
dirt
at
guinny
by
de
ruyter
with
his
fleet
the
particulars
as
much
as
by
sir
carteret
afterwards
i
heard
i
have
said
in
a
letter
to
my
lord
sandwich
this
day
at
portsmouth
it
being
meet
wholly
to
the
utter
ruine
of
our
royall
company
and
reproach
and
shame
to
the
whole
nation
as
well
as
justification
to
them
in
their
doing
wrong
to
no
man
as
to
his
private
property
only
taking
whatever
is
found
to
belong
to
the
company
and
nothing
else
to
redriffe
and
just
in
time
within
two
minutes
and
saw
the
new
vessel
of
sir
william
petty
launched
the
king
and
duke
being
there
it
swims
and
looks
finely
and
i
believe
will
do
well
at
noon
to
the
to
the
and
there
heard
sir
richard
ford
tell
the
whole
story
of
our
defeat
at
guinny
wherein
our
men
are
guilty
of
the
most
horrid
cowardice
and
perfidiousness
as
he
says
and
tells
it
that
ever
englishmen
were
captain
reynolds
that
was
the
only
commander
of
any
of
the
king
ships
there
was
shot
at
by
de
ruyter
with
a
bloody
flag
flying
he
instead
of
opposing
which
indeed
had
been
to
no
purpose
but
only
to
maintain
honour
did
poorly
go
on
board
himself
to
ask
what
de
ruyter
would
have
and
so
yield
to
whatever
ruyter
would
desire
the
king
and
duke
are
highly
vexed
at
it
it
seems
and
the
business
deserves
it
i
saw
the
comet
which
is
now
whether
worn
away
or
no
i
know
not
but
appears
not
with
a
tail
but
only
is
larger
and
duller
than
any
other
star
and
is
come
to
rise
betimes
and
to
make
a
great
arch
and
is
gone
quite
to
a
new
place
in
the
heavens
than
it
was
before
but
i
hope
in
a
clearer
night
something
more
will
be
seen
to
sir
pen
to
his
lady
margaret
daughter
of
john
jasper
a
merchant
at
rotterdam
who
is
a
fat
short
old
dutch
woman
but
one
that
hath
been
heretofore
pretty
handsome
and
is
i
believe
very
discreet
and
hath
more
wit
than
her
husband
public
matters
are
all
in
a
hurry
about
a
dutch
warr
our
preparations
great
our
provocations
against
them
great
and
after
all
our
presumption
we
are
now
afraid
as
much
of
them
as
we
lately
contemned
them
every
thing
else
in
the
state
quiet
blessed
be
god
my
lord
sandwich
at

at

some
about
to
cruise
for
taking
of
ships

we
have
done
to
a
great
number

christmas

it

look
over
all
my

to

found
either
boyish
or
not
to
be
worth
keeping
or
fit
to
be
seen
if
it
should
please
god
to
take
me
away
suddenly

now
at
land
i
brought
with
me
made
from
the
seamen
at
sea
to
their
ladies
in
town
saying
sir
pen
sir
ascue
and
sir
lawson
made
them
here
a
most
noble
french
dinner
and
banquet
the
street
full
of
footballs
it
being
a
great
frost
to
my
lord
of
oxford
but
his
lordship
was
in
bed
at
past
ten
and
lord
help
us
so
rude
a
dirty
family
i
never
saw
in
my
life
i
saw
the
royal
society
bring
their
new
book
wherein
is
nobly
writ
their
charter
and
laws
and
comes
to
be
signed
by
the
duke
as
a
fellow
and
all
the
fellows
hands
are
to
be
entered
there
and
lie
as
a
monument
and
the
king
hath
put
his
with
the
word
founder
holmes
was
this
day
sent
to
the
tower
but
i
perceive
it
is
made
matter
of
jest
only
but
if
the
dutch
should
be
our
masters
it
may
come
to
be
of
earnest
to
him
to
be
given
over
to
them
for
a
sacrifice
as
sir
rawly
was
to
a
tangier
committee
where
i
was
accosted
and
most
highly
complimented
by
my
lord
bellasses
our
new
governor
beyond
my
expectation
and
i
may
make
good
use
of
it
our
patent
is
renewed
and
he
and
my
lord
barkeley
and
sir
thomas
ingram
chancellor
of
the
duchy
of
lancaster
and
a
privy
counsellor
ob
put
in
as
commissioners
this
evening
by
a
letter
from
plymouth
i
hear
that
two
of
our
ships
the
leopard
and
another
in
the
straights
are
lost
by
running
aground
and
that
three
more
had
like
to
have
been
so
but
got
off
whereof
captain
allen
one
and
that
a
dutch
fleet
are
gone
thither
and
if
they
should
meet
with
our
lame
ships
god
knows
what
would
become
of
them
this
i
reckon
most
sad
news
god
make
us
sensible
of
it
spoke
with
a
frenchman
who
was
taken
but
released
by
a
dutch
of
guns
with
seven
more
of
the
king
or
greater
ships
off
the
north
foreland
by
margett
which
is
a
strange
attempt
that
they
should
come
to
our
teeth
but
the
wind
being
easterly
the
wind
that
should
bring
our
force
from
portsmouth
will
carry
them
away
home
yesterday
news
confirmed
though
a
little
different
but
a
couple
of
ships
in
the
straights
we
have
lost
and
the
dutch
have
been
in
margret
road
query
margate
to
the
king
house
there
to
see
vulpone
a
comedy
by
ben
jonson
a
most
excellent
play
the
best
i
think
i
ever
saw
and
well
acted
with
sir
pen
in
his
coach
to
my
lord
chancellor
where
by
and
by
coventry
sir
pen
sir
lawson
sir
ascue
and
myself
were
called
in
to
the
king
there
being
several
of
the
privy
council
and
my
lord
chancellor
lying
at
length
upon
a
couch
of
the
goute
i
suppose
and
there
sir
pen
spoke
pretty
well
to
dissuade
the
king
from
letting
the
turkey
ships
go
out
saying
in
short
the
king
having
resolved
to
have
ships
out
by
the
spring
he
must
have
above
of
them
merchantmen
towards
which
he
in
the
whole
river
could
find
but
or
and
of
them
the
five
ships
taken
up
by
these
merchants
were
a
part
and
so
could
not
be
spared
that
we
should
need
sailors
to
man
these
ships
and
of
them
in
service
we
have
not
above
so
that
we
shall
need
more
that
these
ships
will
with
their
convoys
carry
about
men
and
those
the
best
men
that
could
be
got
it
being
the
men
used
to
the
southward
that
are
the
best
men
of
warr
though
those
bred
in
the
north
among
the
colliers
are
good
for
labour
that
it
will
not
be
safe
for
the
merchants
nor
honourable
for
the
king
to
expose
these
rich
ships
with
his
convoy
of
six
ships
to
go
it
not
being
enough
to
secure
them
against
the
dutch
who
without
doubt
will
have
a
great
fleet
in
the
straights
this
sir
enlarged
upon
sir
ascue
chiefly
spoke
that
the
warr
and
trade
could
not
be
supported
together
coventry
showed
how
the
medium
of
the
men
the
king
hath
one
year
with
another
employed
in
his
navy
since
his
coming
hath
not
been
above
men
or
at
most
men
and
now
having
occasion
of
the
remaining
must
be
found
out
of
the
trade
of
the
nation
he
showed
how
the
cloaths
sending
by
these
merchants
to
turkey
are
already
bought
and
paid
for
to
the
workmen
and
are
as
many
as
they
would
send
these
twelve
months
or
more
so
the
poor
do
not
suffer
by
their
not
going
but
only
the
merchant
upon
whose
hands
they
lie
dead
and
so
the
inconvenience
is
the
less
and
yet
for
them
he
propounded
either
the
king
should
if
his
treasurer
would
suffer
it
buy
them
and
showed
the
loss
would
not
be
so
great
to
him
or
dispense
with
the
act
of
navigation
and
let
them
be
carried
out
by
strangers
and
ending
that
he
doubted
not
but
when
the
merchants
saw
there
was
no
remedy
they
would
and
could
find
ways
of
sending
them
abroad
to
their
profit
all
ended
with
a
conviction
unless
future
discourse
with
the
merchants
should
alter
it
that
it
was
not
fit
for
them
to
go
out
though
the
ships
be
loaded
so
we
withdrew
and
the
merchants
were
called
in
staying
without
my
lord
fitzharding
come
thither
and
fell
to
discourse
of
prince
rupert
disease
morbus
scil
gallicus
telling
the
horrible
degree
of
its
breaking
out
on
his
head
he
observed
also
from
the
prince
that
courage
is
not
what
men
take
it
to
be
a
contempt
of
death
for
says
he
how
chagrined
the
prince
was
the
other
day
when
he
thought
he
should
die
to
a
tangier
committee
where
my
lord
ashly
i
observe
is
a
most
clear
man
in
matters
of
accounts
and
most
ingeniously
did
discourse
and
explain
all
matters
this
day
was
buried
but
i
could
not
be
there
my
cosen
percivall
angler
and
yesterday
i
received
the
news
that
tom
pepys
is
dead
at
impington
povy
carried
me
to
somerset
house
and
there
showed
me
the
chamber
and
closet
most
beautiful
places
for
furniture
and
pictures
and
so
down
the
great
stone
stairs
to
the
garden
and
tried
the
brave
echo
upon
the
stairs
which
continues
a
voice
so
long
as
the
singing
three
notes
concords
one
after
another
they
all
three
shall
sound
in
consort
together
a
good
while
most
pleasantly
up
and
with
sir
batten
and
sir
pen
to
white
hall
but
there
finding
the
duke
gone
to
his
lodgings
in
st
for
alltogether
his
duchesse
being
ready
to
lie
in
we
to
him
and
there
did
our
usual
business
and
here
i
met
the
great
news
confirmed
by
the
duke
own
relation
by
a
letter
from
captain
allen
first
of
our
own
loss
of
two
ships
the
phoenix
and
nonsuch
in
the
bay
of
gibraltar
then
of
his
and
his
seven
ships
with
him
in
the
bay
of
cales
or
thereabouts
fighting
with
the
dutch
smyrna
fleet
sinking
the
king
salamon
a
ship
worth
a
or
more
some
say
and
another
and
taking
of
three
two
of
our
ships
were
disabled
by
the
dutch
unfortunately
falling
against
their
will
against
them
the
advice
captain
poole
and
antelope
captain
clerke
the
dutch
men
of
war
did
little
service
captain
allen
before
he
would
fire
one
gun
come
within
of
the
enemy
the
spaniards
at
cales
did
stand
laughing
at
the
dutch
to
see
them
run
away
and
flee
to
the
shore
or
thereabouts
against
eight
englishmen
at
most
i
do
purpose
to
get
the
whole
relation
if
i
live
of
captain
allen
himself
in
our
loss
of
the
two
ships
in
the
bay
of
gibraltar
the
world
do
comment
upon
the
misfortune
of
captain
moone
of
the
nonsuch
who
did
lose
in
the
same
manner
the
satisfaction
as
a
person
that
hath
attending
him
that
the
whole
fleet
was
ashore
captain
allen
led
the
way
and
himself
writes
that
all
the
masters
of
the
fleet
old
and
young
were
mistaken
and
did
carry
their
ships
aground
but
i
think
i
heard
the
duke
say
that
moone
being
put
into
oxford
had
in
this
conflict
regained
his
credit
by
sinking
one
and
taking
another
captain
seale
of
the
milford
hath
done
his
part
very
well
in
boarding
the
king
salamon
which
held
out
half
an
hour
after
she
was
boarded
and
his
men
kept
her
an
hour
after
they
did
master
her
and
then
she
sunk
and
drowned
about
of
her
men
the
dutch
have
by
consent
of
all
the
provinces
voted
no
trade
to
be
suffered
for
eighteen
months
but
that
they
apply
themselves
wholly
to
the
war
this
statement
of
a
total
prohibition
of
all
trade
and
for
so
long
a
period
as
eighteen
months
by
a
government
so
essentially
commercial
as
that
of
the
united
provinces
seems
extraordinary
the
fact
as
i
am
informed
was
that
when
in
the
beginning
of
the
year
the
states
general
saw
that
the
war
with
england
was
become
inevitable
they
took
several
vigorous
measures
and
determined
to
equip
a
formidable
fleet
and
with
a
view
to
obtain
a
sufficient
number
of
men
to
man
it
prohibited
all
navigation
especially
in
the
great
and
small
fisheries
as
they
were
then
called
and
in
the
whale
fishery
this
measure
appears
to
have
resembled
the
embargoes
so
commonly
resorted
to
in
this
country
on
similar
occasions
rather
than
a
total
prohibition
of
trade
slingsby
a
very
ingenious
person
about
the
mint
tells
me
that
the
money
passing
up
and
down
in
business
is
he
also
made
me
fully
understand
that
the
old
law
of
prohibiting
bullion
to
be
exported
is
and
ever
was
a
folly
and
an
injury
rather
than
good
february
to
visit
my
lady
sandwich
and
she
discoursed
largely
to
me
her
opinion
of
a
match
if
it
could
be
thought
fit
by
my
lord
for
my
lady
jemimah
with
sir
carteret
eldest
son
but
i
doubt
he
hath
yet
no
settled
estate
in
land
but
i
will
inform
myself
and
give
her
my
opinion
then
pickering
after
private
discourse
ended
we
going
into
the
other
room
did
at
my
lady
command
tell
me
the
manner
of
a
masquerade
before
the
king
and
the
court
the
other
day
where
six
women
my
lady
castlermaine
and
duchesse
of
monmouth
being
two
of
them
and
six
men
the
duke
of
monmouth
and
lord
avon
and
monsieur
blanfort
lewis
duras
marquis
de
blanquefort
naturalized
charles
and
created
baron
duras
and
by
james
whom
he
had
attended
in
the
as
captain
of
the
guard
being
three
of
them
in
vizards
but
most
rich
and
antique
dresses
did
dance
admirably
and
most
gloriously
god
give
us
cause
to
continue
the
mirth
i
to
the
sun
behind
the
to
dinner
to
my
lord
belasses
he
told
us
a
very
handsome
passage
of
the
sending
him
his
message
about
holding
out
the
town
of
newarke
of
which
he
was
then
governor
for
the
king
this
message
he
sent
in
a
being
writ
in
cipher
and
wrapped
up
in
lead
and
sealed
so
the
messenger
come
to
my
lord
and
told
him
he
had
a
message
from
the
king
but
it
was
yet
in
his
belly
so
they
did
give
him
some
physick
and
out
it
come
this
was
a
month
before
the
king
flying
to
the
scots
and
therein
he
told
him
that
at
such
a
day
the
or
of
may
he
should
hear
of
his
being
come
to
the
scots
being
assured
by
the
king
of
france
that
in
coming
to
them
he
should
be
used
with
all
the
liberty
honour
and
safety
that
could
be
desired
and
at
the
just
day
he
did
come
to
the
scots
he
told
us
another
odd
passage
how
the
king
having
newly
put
out
prince
rupert
of
his
generalship
upon
some
miscarriage
at
bristol
and
sir
richard
willis
of
his
governorship
of
newarke
at
the
entreaty
of
the
gentry
of
the
county
and
put
in
my
lord
bellasses
the
great
officers
of
the
king
army
mutinyed
and
come
in
that
manner
with
swords
drawn
into
the
of
the
town
where
the
king
was
which
the
king
hearing
says
i
must
horse
and
there
himself
personally
when
everybody
expected
they
should
have
been
opposed
the
king
come
and
cried
to
the
head
of
the
mutineers
which
was
prince
rupert
nephew
i
command
you
to
be
gone
so
the
prince
in
all
his
fury
and
discontent
withdrew
and
his
company
scattered
one
of
the
coldest
days
all
say
they
ever
felt
in
england
sir
william
petty
tells
me
that
barlow
predecessor
as
clerk
of
the
acts
to
whom
he
paid
part
of
the
salary
is
dead
for
which
god
knows
my
heart
i
could
be
as
sorry
as
is
possible
for
one
to
be
for
a
stranger
by
whose
death
he
gets
per
annum
to
church
to
lawrence
to
hear
wilkins
the
great
scholar
for
curiosity
i
having
never
heard
him
but
was
not
satisfied
with
him
at
all
at
noon
with
creed
to
the
where
a
very
good
dinner
among
the
old
jokers
and
an
extraordinary
discourse
of
the
manner
of
the
loss
of
the
royall
oake
coming
home
from
bantam
upon
the
rocks
of
scilly
thence
with
creed
to
gresham
college
where
i
had
been
by
povy
the
last
week
proposed
to
be
admitted
a
member
and
was
this
day
admitted
by
signing
a
book
and
being
taken
by
the
hand
by
the
president
my
lord
brouncker
and
some
words
of
admittance
said
to
me
but
it
is
a
most
acceptable
thing
to
hear
their
discourse
and
see
their
experiments
which
were
this
day
on
fire
and
how
it
goes
out
in
a
place
where
the
ayre
is
not
free
and
sooner
out
where
the
ayre
is
exhausted
which
they
showed
by
an
engine

neat

already
called

very
noble

believe
it
will

coming
over
from
france
and

believed

mad
freaks
the
mayds
of
honour
at
court
have
that
jenings
one
of
the
dutchesse
maids
the
other
day
dressed
herself
like
an
orange
wench
and
went
up
and
down
and
cried
oranges
till
falling
down
or
by
some
accident
her
fine
shoes
were
discerned
and
she
put
to
a
great
deal
of
shame
that
such
as
these
tricks
being
ordinary
and
worse
among
them
thereby
few
will
venture
upon
them
for
wives
my
lady
castlemaine
will
in
merriment
say
that
her
daughter
not
above
a
year
old
or
two
will
be
the
first
mayd
in
the
court

will
be

george
hamilton
afterwards
knighted
and
in
the
french
service
and
richard
talbot
created
duke
of
tyrconnel

died
in
ireland
the
anecdote
here
related
will
be
found
in
the
memoires
de
grammont
this
day
my
lord
sandwich
writ
me
word
from
the
downes
that
he
is
like
to
be
in
town
this
week
at
noon
to
the
busy
where
great
talk
of
a
dutch
ship
in
the
north
put
on
shore
and
taken
by
a
troop
of
horse
at
noon
to
the
where
just
before
i
come
the
swede
that
had
told
the
king
and
the
duke
so
boldly
a
great
lie
of
the
dutch
flinging
our
men
back
to
back
into
the
sea
at
guinny
so
particularly
and
readily
and
confidently
was
whipt
round
the
he
confessing
it
a
lie
and
that
he
did
it
in
hopes
to
get
something
we
to
a
committee
of
the
council
to
discourse
concerning
pressing
of
men
but
lord
how
they
meet
never
sit
down
one
comes
now
another
goes
then
comes
another
one
complaining
that
nothing
is
done
another
swearing
that
he
hath
been
there
these
two
hours
and
nobody
come
at
last
my
lord
annesly
created
earl
of
anglesea
says
i
think
we
must
be
forced
to
get
the
king
to
come
to
every
committee
for
i
do
not
see
that
we
do
any
thing
at
any
time
but
when
he
is
here
and
i
believe
he
said
the
truth
and
very
constant
he
is
on
which
his
predecessors
it
seems
very
rarely
were
to
sir
philip
warwick
and
there
he
did
contract
with
me
a
kind
of
friendship
and
freedom
of
communication
wherein
he
assures
me
to
make
me
understand
the
whole
business
of
the
treasurer
of
the
navy
that
i
shall
know
as
well
as
sir
carteret
what
money
he
hath
and
will
needs
have
me
come
to
him
sometimes
or
he
meet
me
to
discourse
of
things
tending
to
the
serving
the
king
and
i
am
mighty
proud
and
happy
in
becoming
so
known
to
such
a
man
and
i
hope
shall
pursue
it
march
to
gresham
college
where
hooke
read
a
second
very
curious
lecture
about
the
late
comet
among
other
things
proving
very
probably
that
this
is
the
very
same
comet
that
appeared
before
in
the
year
and
that
in
such
a
time
probably
it
will
appear
again
which
is
a
very
new
opinion
but
all
will
be
in
print
then
to
the
meeting
where
sir
carteret
two
sons
his
own
and
sir
slaning
sir
nicholas
slaning
married
a
daughter
of
sir
george
carteret
were
admitted
of
the
society
and
this
day
i
did
pay
my
admission
money
to
the
society
william
howe
come
to
see
me
being
come
up
with
my
lord
from
sea
he
is
grown
a
discreet
but
very
conceited
fellow
he
tells
me
how
little
respectfully
sir
pen
did
carry
it
to
my
lord
on
board
the
duke
ship
at
sea
and
that
captain
minnes
a
favourite
of
prince
rupert
do
show
my
lord
little
respect
but
that
every
body
else
esteems
my
lord
as
they
ought
this
day
was
proclaimed
at
the
the
war
with
holland
to
my
lord
sandwich
and
dined
with
my
lord
it
being
the
first
time
he
hath
dined
at
home
since
his
coming
from
sea
and
a
pretty
odd
demand
it
was
of
my
lord
to
my
lady
before
me
how
do
you
sweetheart
how
have
you
done
all
this
week
himself
taking
notice
of
it
to
me
that
he
had
hardly
seen
her
the
week
before
at
dinner
he
did
use
me
with
the
greatest
solemnity
in
the
world
in
carving
for
me
and
nobody
else
and
calling
often
to
my
lady
to
cut
for
me
and
all
the
respect
possible
with
sir
minnes
to
james
and
there
did
our
business
with
the
duke
great
preparations
for
his
speedy
return
to
sea
i
saw
him
try
on
his
buff
coat
and
covered
with
black
velvet
it
troubles
me
more
to
think
of
his
venture
than
of
any
thing
else
in
the
whole
warr
this
morning
is
brought
me
to
the
office
the
sad
news
of
the
london
in
which
sir
lawson
men
were
all
bringing
her
from
chatham
to
the
hope
and
thence
he
was
to
go
to
sea
in
her
but
a
little
on
this
side
the
buoy
of
the
nower
she
suddenly
blew
up
about
men
and
a
woman
that
were
in
the
and
coach
saved
the
rest
being
about
drowned
the
ship
breaking
all
in
pieces
with
pieces
of
brass
ordnance
she
lies
sunk
with
her
above
water
sir
lawson
hath
a
great
loss
in
this
of
so
many
good
chosen
men
and
many
relations
among
them
i
went
to
the
where
the
news
taken
very
much
to
heart
at
noon
to
the
where
very
hot
people
proposal
of
the
city
giving
the
king
another
ship
for
the
london
that
is
lately
blown
up
it
would
be
very
handsome
and
if
well
managed
might
be
done
but
i
fear
if
it
be
put
into
ill
hands
or
that
the
courtiers
do
solicit
it
it
will
never
be
done
this
day
my
wife
begun
to
wear
locks
quite
white
almost
which
though
it
makes
her
look
very
pretty
yet
not
being
natural
vexes
me
that
i
will
not
have
her
wear
them
this
day
i
saw
my
lord
castlemaine
at
james
lately
come
from
france
the
duke
did
give
us
some
commands
and
so
broke
up
not
taking
leave
of
him
but
the
best
piece
of
newes
is
that
instead
of
a
great
many
troublesome
lords
the
whole
business
is
to
be
left
with
the
duke
of
albemarle
to
act
as
admirall
in
his
stead
which
is
a
thing
that
do
cheer
my
heart
for
the
other
would
have
vexed
us
with
attendance
and
never
done
the
business
povy
and
i
in
his
coach
to
hyde
parke
being
the
first
day
of
the
tour
there
where
many
brave
ladies
among
others
castlemaine
lay
impudently
upon
her
back
in
her
coach
asleep
with
her
mouth
open
there
was
also
my
lady
kerneguy
daughter
of
william
duke
of
hamilton
wife
of
lord
carnegy
who
became
earl
of
southesk
on
his
father
death
she
is
frequently
mentioned
in
the
memoires
de
grammont
once
my
lady
anne
hambleton
creed
and
i
had
povy
coach
sent
for
us
and
we
to
his
house
where
we
did
some
business
in
order
to
the
work
of
this
day
povy
and
i
to
my
lord
sandwich
who
tells
me
that
the
duke
is
not
only
a
friend
to
the
business
but
to
me
in
terms
of
the
greatest
love
and
respect
the
duke
did
direct
secretary
bennet
to
declare
his
mind
to
the
tangier
committee
that
he
approves
of
me
for
treasurer
and
with
a
character
of
me
to
be
a
man
whose
industry
and
discretion
he
would
trust
soon
as
any
man
in
england
and
did
the
like
to
my
lord
sandwich
so
to
white
hall
to
the
committee
of
tangier
where
there
were
present
my
lord
of
albemarle
my
lord
peterborough
sandwich
barkeley
fitzharding
secretary
bennet
sir
thomas
ingram
sir
john
lawson
povy
and
i
where
after
other
business
povy
did
declare
his
business
very
handsomely
that
he
was
sorry
he
had
been
so
unhappy
in
his
accounts
as
not
to
give
their
lordships
the
satisfaction
he
intended
and
that
he
was
sure
his
accounts
were
right
and
continues
to
submit
them
to
examination
and
is
ready
to
lay
down
in
ready
money
the
fault
of
his
account
and
that
for
the
future
that
the
work
might
be
better
done
and
with
more
quiet
to
him
he
desired
by
approbation
of
the
duke
he
might
resign
his
place
to
pepys
whereupon
secretary
bennet
did
deliver
the
duke
command
which
was
received
with
great
content
and
allowance
beyond
expectation
the
secretary
repeating
also
the
duke
character
of
me
and
i
could
discern
my
lord
fitzharding
was
well
pleased
with
me
and
signified
full
satisfaction
and
whispered
something
seriously
of
me
to
the
secretary
and
there
i
received
their
constitution
under
all
their
hands
presently
so
that
i
am
already
confirmed
their
treasurer
and
put
into
a
condition
of
striking
of
tallys
and
all
without
one
harsh
word
of
dislike
but
quite
the
contrary
which
is
a
good
fortune
beyond
all
imagination
sir
william
petty
did
tell
me
that
in
good
earnest
he
hath
in
his
will
left
some
parts
of
his
estate
to
him
that
could
invent
such
and
such
things
as
among
others
that
could
discover
truly
the
way
of
milk
coming
into
the
breasts
of
a
woman
and
he
that
could
invent
proper
characters
to
express
to
another
the
mixture
of
relishes
and
tastes
and
says
that
to
him
that
invents
gold
he
gives
nothing
for
the
stone
for
says
he
they
that
find
out
that
will
be
able
to
pay
themselves
but
says
he
by
this
means
it
is
better
than
to
go
to
a
lecture
for
here
my
executors
that
must
part
with
this
will
be
sure
to
be
well
convinced
of
the
invention
before
they
do
part
with
their
money
i
saw
the
duke
kissed
his
hand
and
had
his
most
kind
expressions
of
his
value
and
opinion
of
me
which
comforted
me
above
all
things
in
the
world
the
like
from
coventry
most
heartily
and
affectionately
saw
among
other
fine
ladies
middleton
jane
daughter
to
sir
robert
needham
frequently
mentioned
in
the
memoires
de
grammont
her
portrait
is
at
windsor
castle
amongst
the
beauties
of
charles
ii
court
a
very
great
beauty
and
i
saw
waller
edmund
waller
the
poet
whom
i
never
saw
before
to
my
lord
sandwich
who
follows
the
duke
this
day
by
water
down
to
the
hope
where
the
prince
lies
he
received
me
busy
as
he
was
with
mighty
kindness
and
joy
at
my
promotions
telling
me
most
largely
how
the
duke
hath
expressed
on
all
occasions
his
good
opinion
of
my
service
and
love
for
me
i
paid
my
thanks
and
acknowledgement
to
him
and
so
back
home
where
at
the
office
all
the
morning
up
betimes
to
povy
and
there
did
sign
and
seal
my
agreement
with
him
about
my
place
of
being
treasurer
for
tangier
thence
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
the
first
time
that
we
officers
of
the
navy
have
waited
upon
him
since
the
duke
of
york
going
who
hath
deputed
him
to
be
admiral
in
his
absence
and
i
find
him
a
quiet
heavy
man
that
will
help
business
when
he
can
and
hinder
nothing
i
did
afterwards
alone
give
him
thanks
for
his
favour
to
me
about
my
tangier
business
which
he
received
kindly
and
did
speak
much
of
his
esteem
of
me
thence
and
did
the
same
to
sir
bennet
who
did
the
like
to
me
very
fully
april
with
sir
carteret
sir
batten
and
sir
minnes
to
my
lord
treasurer
and
there
did
lay
open
the
expence
for
the
six
months
past
and
an
estimate
of
the
seven
months
to
come
to
november
next
the
first
arising
to
above
and
the
latter
will
as
we
judge
come
to
above
but
to
see
how
my
lord
treasurer
did
bless
himself
crying
he
would
do
no
more
than
he
could
nor
give
more
money
than
he
had
if
the
occasion
and
expence
were
never
so
great
which
is
but
a
bad
story
to
a
play
at
the
duke
of
my
lord
orrery
called
mustapha
there
was
another
tragedy
of
this
name
by
fulk
lord
brook
which
being
not
good
made
beterton
part
and
ianthe
but
ordinary
too
all
the
pleasure
of
the
play
was
the
king
and
my
lady
castlemaine
were
there
and
pretty
witty
nell
nel
gwynne
at
the
king
house
and
the
younger
marshall
sat
next
us
which
pleased
me
mightily
great
talk
of
a
new
comet
and
it
is
certain
do
appear
as
bright
as
the
late
one
at
the
best
but
i
have
not
seen
it
myself
sir
philip
warwick
did
show
me
nakedly
the
king
condition
for
money
for
the
navy
and
he
do
assure
me
unless
the
king
can
get
some
noblemen
or
rich
to
lend
him
money
or
to
get
the
city
to
do
it
it
is
impossible
to
find
money
we
having
already
as
he
says
spent
one
year
share
of
the
years
tax
which
comes
to
my
lord
brouncker
took
me
and
sir
thomas
harvy
in
his
coach
to
the
park
which
is
very
troublesome
with
the
dust
and
a
great
beauty
there
to
day
but
middleton
sir
carteret
my
lord
brouncker
sir
thomas
harvy
and
myself
down
to
my
lord
treasurer
chamber
to
him
and
the
chancellor
and
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
there
i
did
give
them
a
large
account
of
the
charge
of
the
navy
and
want
of
money
but
strange
to
see
how
they
hold
up
their
hands
crying
what
shall
we
do
says
my
lord
treasurer
why
what
means
all
this
pepys
this
is
true
you
say
but
what
would
you
have
me
to
do
i
have
given
all
i
can
for
my
life
why
will
not
people
lend
their
money
why
will
they
not
trust
the
king
as
well
as
oliver
why
do
our
prizes
come
to
nothing
that
yielded
so
much
heretofore
and
this
was
all
we
could
get
and
went
away
without
other
answer
captain
taylor
can
as
he
says
show
the
very
originall
charter
to
worcester
of
king
edgar
wherein
he
stiles
himself
rex
marium
britanniae
which
is
the
great
text
that
selden
and
others
do
quote
but
imperfectly
and
upon
trust
but
he
hath
the
very
originall
which
he
says
he
will
show
me
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
where
he
showed
me
coventry
letters
how
three
dutch
privateers
are
taken
in
one
whereof
everson
son
is
captaine
but
they
have
killed
poor
captaine
golding
in
the
diamond
two
of
them
one
of
and
the
other
of
odd
guns
did
stand
stoutly
up
against
her
which
hath
and
the
yarmouth
that
hath
guns
and
as
many
more
men
as
they
so
that
they
did
more
than
we
could
expect
not
yielding
till
many
of
their
men
were
killed
and
everson
when
he
was
brought
before
the
duke
of
york
and
was
observed
to
be
shot
through
the
hat
answered
that
he
wished
it
had
gone
through
his
head
rather
than
been
taken
one
thing
more
is
written
that
two
of
our
ships
the
other
day
appearing
upon
the
coast
of
holland
they
presently
fired
their
beacons
round
the
country
to
give
them
notice
and
news
is
brought
the
king
that
the
dutch
smyrna
fleet
is
seen
upon
the
back
of
scotland
and
thereupon
the
king
hath
wrote
to
the
duke
that
he
do
appoint
a
fleet
to
go
to
the
northward
to
try
to
meet
them
coming
home
round
which
god
send
thence
to
white
hall
where
the
king
seeing
me
did
come
to
me
and
calling
me
by
name
did
discourse
with
me
about
the
ships
in
the
river
and
this
is
the
first
time

know
me
personally

expectation
to
be
questioned
and
to
be
ready
to
give
good
answers

by
five
and
by
water
to
white
hall
and
there

difficulties
my
lord

roberts
would
make
at
my
tangier
privy
seale
he
did
pass
it
at
first
reading
without
my
speaking
with
him
and
then
called
me
in
and
was
very
civil
to
me
i
passed
my
time
in
contemplating
before
i
was
called
in
the
picture
of
my
son
lady
a
most
beautiful
woman
and
most
like
to
butler
thence
very
much
joyed

again
and

to
gresham
college
this
night
i
am
told
the
first
play
is
played
in
white
hall
which
is
now
turned
to
a
house
of
playing
to
white
hall
chapel
and
heard
the
famous
young
stillingfleete
edward
stillingfleet
a
most
learned
divine
consecrated
bishop
of
worcester
ob
whom
i
knew
at
cambridge
and
he
is
now
newly
admitted
one
of
the
chaplains
and
was
presented
they
say
to
my
lord
treasurer
for
andrew
holborn
where
he
is
now
minister
with
these
words
that
they
the
bishops
of
canterbury
london
and
another
believed
he
is
the
ablest
young
man
to
preach
the
gospel
of
any
since
the
apostles
he
did
make
a
most
plain
honest
good
grave
sermon
in
the
most
unconcerned
and
easy
yet
substantial
manner
that
ever
i
heard
in
my
life
upon
the
words
of
samuel
to
the
people
fear
the
lord
in
truth
with
all
your
heart
and
remember
the
great
things
that
he
hath
done
for
you
it
being
proper
to
this
day
the
day
of
the
king
coronation
thence
to
the
and
there
walked
an
hour
with
my
lord
duke
of
albemarle
alone
in
his
garden
where
he
expressed
in
great
words
his
opinion
of
me
that
i
was
the
right
hand
of
the
navy
here
nobody
but
i
taking
any
care
of
any
thing
therein
so
that
he
should
not
know
what
could
be
done
without
me
at
which
i
was
from
him
not
a
little
proud
down
the
river
to
visit
the
where
i
find
all
out
of
order
and
come
home
to
dinner
and
then
to
write
a
letter
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
about
them
and
carried
it
myself
to
the
and
when
they
rose
my
lord
chancellor
passing
by
stroked
me
on
the
head
and
told
me
that
the
board
had
read
my
letter
and
taken
order
for
the
punishing
of
the
watermen
for
not
appearing
on
board
the
ships
and
so
did
the
king
afterwards
who
do
now
know
me
so
well
that
he
never
sees
me
but
he
speaks
to
me
about
our
navy
business
thus
i
end
this
month
in
great
content
as
to
my
estate
and
gettings
in
much
trouble
as
to
the
pains
i
have
taken
and
the
rubs
i
expect
to
meet
with
about
the
business
of
tangier
the
fleet
with
about
ships
upon
the
coast
of
holland
in
sight
of
the
dutch
within
the
texel
great
fears
of
the
sicknesse
here
in
the
city

being
said
that

or
three
houses
are
already
shut
up

towards
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
old
mansion
was
pulled
down
by
sir
gregory
page
who
erected
a
magnificent
stone
structure
on
the
site
which
devolving
to
his
great
nephew
sir
gregory
page
turner
shared
the
same
fate
as
the
former

been
sold
in

any
other
entertainment
good
but
afterwards
to
the
tryal
of
some
experiments
about
making
of
coaches
easy
and
several
we
tried
but
one
did
prove
mighty
easy
not
here
for
me
to
describe
but
the
whole
body
of
the
coach
lies
upon
one
long
spring
and
we
all
one
after
another
rid
in
it
and
it
is
very
fine
and
likely
to
take
thence
to
deptford
and
in
to

beautiful

pleasantly

the
late
taking
of
eight
ships
and
of
his
intent
to
come

down
yesterday
to
meet
the

where
we
did
examine

two
dutchmen
for
which
they
were
committed
to
a
vessel
to
carry
them
to
the

most
fowle
unhandsome
thing

plain
cowardice

thing

some
another
in

duke
of
albemarle
whom
i
found
mightily
off
the
hooks
that
the
ships

not
gone
out
of
the
river
which
vexed
me
to
see
i
hear
that

condemned

be
shot
to
death
for
his
cowardice
by
a
council
of

forced
to
stay
in

a
day
or
two
or

about

to
see
the
event
of
it
thence
to
see
my

fine
rarity

so
for
ever
and
finely
marked

much
afraid
are
safe
in
hambrough
our
fleete
resolve
to
sail
out
again
from
harwich
in
a
day
or
two
to
the
where
great
the
noise
and
trouble
of
having
our
hambrough
ships
lost
and
that
very
much
placed
upon
coventry
forgetting
to
give
notice
to
them
of
the
going
away
of
our
fleet
from
the
coast
of
holland
but
all
without
reason
for
he
did
but
the
merchants
not
being
ready
staid
longer
than
the
time
ordered
for
the
convoy
to
stay
which
was
ten
days
june
after
dinner
i
put
on
new
camelott
suit
the
best
that
ever
i
wore
in
my
life
the
suit
costing
me
above
in
this
i
went
with
creed
to
goldsmiths
hall
to
the
burial
of
sir
thomas
viner
sheriff
of
london
lord
mayor
which
hall
and
haberdashers
also
was
so
full
of
people
that
we
were
fain
for
ease
and
coolness
to
go
forth
to
pater
noster
row
to
choose
silk
to
make
me
a
plain
ordinary
suit
that
done
we
walked
to
corne
hill
and
there
at
cade
stood
in
the
balcon
and
saw
all
the
funeral
which
was
with
the
boys
and
old
men
all
the
aldermen
and
lord
mayor
and
the
number
of
the
company
very
great
the
greatest
i
ever
did
see
for
a
taverne
all
this
day
by
all
people
upon
the
river
and
almost
every
where
else
hereabout
were
heard
the
guns
our
two
fleets
for
certain
being
engaged
which
was
confirmed
by
letters
from
harwich
but
nothing
particular
and
all
our
hearts
full
of
concernment
for
the
duke
and
i
particularly
for
my
lord
sandwich
and
coventry
after
his
royall
highness
to
my
lady
sandwich
who
poor
lady
expects
every
hour
to
hear
of
my
lord
but
in
the
best
temper
neither
confident
nor
troubled
with
fear
that
i
ever
did
see
in
my
life
she
tells
me
my
lord
rochester
is
now
declaredly
out
of
hopes
of
mallett
and
now
she
in
to
receive
notice
in
a
day
or
two
how
the
king
stands
inclined
to
the
giving
leave
for
my
lord
hinchingbroke
to
look
after
her
and
that
being
done
to
bring
it
to
an
end
shortly
the
hottest
day
that
ever
i
felt
in
my
life
this
day
much
against
my
will
i
did
in
drury
lane
see
two
or
three
houses
marked
with
a
red
cross
upon
the
doors
and
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
writ
there
which
was
a
sad
sight
to
me
being
the
first
of
the
kind
that
to
my
remembrance
i
ever
saw
i
to
my
lord
treasurer
by
appointment
of
sir
thomas
ingram
to
meet
the
goldsmiths
where
i
met
with
the
great
news
at
last
newly
come
brought
by
bab
may
baptist
may
keeper
of
the
privy
purse
to
charles
ii
there
is
an
original
portrait
of
him
by
lely
at
audley
end
from
the
duke
of
york
that
we
have
totally
routed
the
dutch
that
the
duke
himself
the
prince
my
lord
sandwich
and
coventry
are
all
well
which
did
put
me
into
such
joy
that
i
forgot
almost
all
other
thoughts
with
great
joy
to
the
where
the
duke
of
albemarle
like
a
man
out
of
himself
with
content
me
all
and
by
and
by
comes
a
letter
from
coventry
own
hand
to
him
which
he
never
opened
which
was
a
strange
thing
but
did
give
it
me
to
open
and
read
and
consider
what
was
fit
for
our
office
to
do
in
it
and
leave
the
letter
with
sir
clerke
which
upon
such
a
time
and
occasion
was
a
strange
piece
of
indifference
hardly
possible
i
copied
out
the
letter
and
did
also
take
minutes
out
of
sir
clerke
other
letters
and
the
sum
of
the
news
is
victory
over
the
dutch
june
this
day
they
engaged
the
dutch
neglecting
greatly
the
opportunity
of
the
wind
they
had
of
us
by
which
they
lost
the
benefit
of
their
the
earl
of
falmouth
muskerry
and
richard
boyle
second
son
to
the
earl
of
burlington
killed
on
board
the
duke
ship
the
royall
charles
with
one
shot
their
blood
and
brains
flying
in
the
duke
face
and
the
head
of
boyle
striking
down
the
duke
as
some
say
earle
of
marlborough
portland
sansum
to
prince
rupert
killed
and
capt
kerby
and
ableson
sir
john
lawson
wounded
on
the
knee
hath
had
some
bones
taken
out
and
is
likely
to
be
well
again
upon
receiving
the
hurt
he
sent
to
the
duke
for
another
to
command
the
royal
oake
the
duke
sent
jordan
out
of
the
george
who
did
brave
things
in
her
capt
jer
smith
of
the
mary
was
second
to
the
duke
and
stepped
between
him
and
captain
seaton
of
the
urania
guns
and
men
who
had
sworn
to
board
the
duke
killed
him
men
and
took
the
ship
himself
losing
men
and
never
an
officer
saved
but
himself
and
lieutenant
his
master
indeed
is
saved
with
his
leg
cut
off
admirall
opdam
blown
up
trump
killed
and
said
by
holmes
all
the
rest
of
their
admiralls
as
they
say
but
everson
whom
they
dare
not
trust
for
his
affection
to
the
prince
of
orange
are
killed
we
having
taken
and
sunk
as
is
believed
about
of
their
best
ships
killed
and
taken
near
or
men
and
lost
we
think
not
above
a
greater
victory
never
known
in
the
world
they
are
all
fled
some
got
into
the
texell
and
others
elsewhere
and
we
in
pursuit
of
the
rest
to
white
hall
and
in
my
way
met
with
moore
who
eases
me
in
one
point
wherein
i
was
troubled
which
was
that
i
heard
of
nothing
said
or
done
by
my
lord
sandwich
but
he
tells
me
that
cowling
my
lord
chamberlain
secretary
did
hear
the
king
say
that
my
lord
sandwich
bad
done
nobly
and
worthily
the
king
it
seems
is
much
troubled
at
the
fall
of
my
lord
falmouth
but
i
do
not
meet
with
any
man
else
that
so
much
as
wishes
him
alive
again
the
world
conceiving
him
a
man
of
too
much
pleasure
to
do
the
king
any
good
or
offer
any
good
office
to
him
but
i
hear
of
all
hands
he
is
confessed
to
have
been
a
man
of
great
honour
that
did
show
it
in
this
his
going
with
the
duke
the
most
that
ever
any
man
did
in
the
evening
home
to
supper
and
there
to
my
great
trouble
hear
that
the
plague
is
come
into
the
city
though
it
hath
these
three
or
four
weeks
since
its
beginning
been
wholly
out
of
the
city
but
where
should
it
begin
but
in
my
good
friend
and
neighbour
burnett
he
was
a
physician
in
fanchurch
street
which
in
both
points
troubles
me
mightily
i
saw
poor
burnett
door
shut
but
he
hath
i
hear
gained
great
among
his
neighbours
for
he
discovered
it
himself
first
and
caused
himself
to
be
shut
up
of
his
own
accord
which
was
very
handsome
at
noon
with
sir
carteret
to
my
lord
mayor
to
dinner
where
much
company
in
a
little
room
his
name
sir
john
lawrence
there
were
at
table
three
sir
richard
brownes
viz
he
of
the
councill
a
clerk
and
the
alderman
and
his
son
and
there
was
a
little
grandson
also
richard
who
will
hereafter
be
sir
richard
browne
my
lord
mayor
very
respectfull
to
me
i
met
with
cowling
who
observed
to
me
how
he
finds
every
body
silent
in
the
praise
of
my
lord
sandwich
to
set
up
the
duke
and
the
prince
but
that
the
duke
did
both
to
the
king
and
my
lord
chancellor
write
abundantly
of
my
lord
courage
and
service
and
i
this
day
met
with
a
letter
of
captain
ferrers
wherein
he
tells
how
my
lord
was
with
his
ship
in
all
the
heat
of
the
day
and
did
most
worthily
to
westminster
and
there
saw
my
lord
marlborough
brought
to
be
buried
several
lords
of
the
council
carrying
him
and
with
the
herald
in
some
state
this
day
the
upon
moore
showing
captain
ferrers
letter
did
do
my
lord
sandwich
great
right
as
to
the
late
victory
the
duke
of
york
not
yet
come
to
town
the
town
grows
very
sickly
and
people
to
be
afraid
of
it
there
dying
this
last
week
of
the
plague
from
the
week
before
whereof
but
one
in
and
one
in
by
the
treasurer
office
after
dinner
and
doing
some
business
at
the
office
i
to
white
hall
where
the
court
is
full
of
the
duke
and
his
courtiers
returned
from
sea
all
fat
and
lusty
and
ruddy
by
being
in
the
sun
i
kissed
his
hands
and
we
waited
all
the
afternoon
by
and
by
saw
coventry
which
rejoiced
my
very
heart
anon
he
and
i
from
all
the
rest
of
the
company
walked
into
the
matted
gallery
where
after
many
expressions
of
love
we
fell
to
talk
of
business
among
other
things
how
my
lord
sandwich
both
in
his
councils
and
personal
service
hath
done
most
honourably
and
serviceably
sir
lawson
is
come
to
greenwich
but
his
wound
in
his
knee
yet
very
bad
jonas
poole
in
the
vantguard
did
basely
so
as
to
be
or
will
be
turned
out
of
his
ship
captain
holmes
expecting
upon
sansum
death
to
be
made
to
the
prince
but
harman
is
put
in
hath
delivered
up
to
the
duke
his
commission
which
the
duke
took
and
tore
he
it
seems
had
bid
the
prince
who
first
told
him
of
holmes
intention
that
he
should
dissuade
him
from
it
for
that
he
was
resolved
to
take
it
if
he
offered
it
yet
holmes
would
do
it
like
a
rash
proud
coxcombe
but
he
is
rich
and
hath
it
seems
sought
an
occasion
of
leaving
the
service
several
of
our
captains
have
done
ill
the
great
ships
are
the
ships
do
the
business
they
quite
deadening
the
enemy
they
run
away
upon
sight
of
the
prince
it
is
strange
to
see
how
people
do
already
slight
sir
william
barkeley
killed
in
the
the
following
year
vide
june
my
lord
fitzharding
brother
who
three
months
since
was
the
delight
of
the
court
captain
smith
of
the
mary
the
duke
talks
mightily
of
and
some
great
thing
will
be
done
for
him
strange
to
hear
how
the
dutch
do
relate
as
the
duke
says
that
they
are
the
conquerors
and
bonfires
are
made
in
dunkirke
in
their
behalf
though
a
clearer
victory
can
never
be
expected
coventry
thinks
they
can
not
have
lost
less
than
men
and
we
not
dead
above
and
wounded
about
in
all
about
captain
grove
the
duke
told
us
this
day
hath
done
the
basest
thing
at
lowestoffe
in
hearing
of
the
guns
and
could
not
as
others
be
got
out
but
staid
there
for
which
he
will
be
tried
and
is
reckoned
a
prating
coxcombe
and
of
no
courage
it
struck
me
very
deep
this
afternoon
going
with
a
hackney
coach
from
lord
treasurer
down
holborne
the
coachman
i
found
to
drive
easily
and
easily
at
last
stood
still
and
come
down
hardly
able
to
stand
and
told
me
that
he
was
suddenly
struck
very
sick
and
almost
blind
he
could
not
see
so
i
light
and
went
into
another
coach
with
a
sad
heart
for
the
poor
man
and
for
myself
also
lest
he
should
have
been
struck
with
the
plague
sir
john
lawson
i
hear
is
worse
than
yesterday
the
king
went
to
see
him
most
kindly
it
seems
his
wound
is
not
very
bad
but
he
hath
a
fever
a
thrush
and
a
all
three
together
which
are
it
seems
very
bad
symptoms
for
victory
over
the
dutch
to
the
dolphin
taverne
where
all
we
officers
of
the
navy
met
with
the
commissioners
of
the
ordnance
by
agreement
and
dined
where
good
musique
at
my
direction
our
club
come
to
a
man
nine
of
us
by
water
to
and
there
walked
an
hour
alone
observing
the
several
humours
of
the
citizens
that
were
there
this
pulling
off
cherries
and
god
knows
what
this
day
i
informed
myself
that
there
died
four
of
five
at
westminster
of
the
plague
in
several
houses
upon
sunday
last
in
over
against
the
yet
people
do
think
that
the
number
will
be
fewer
in
the
town
than
it
was
the
last
week
the
dutch
are
come
out
again
with
sail
under
banker
supposed
gone
to
the
northward
to
meet
their
east
india
fleet
i
find
our
tallys
will
not
be
money
in
less
than
sixteen
months
which
is
a
sad
thing
for
the
king
to
pay
all
that
interest
for
every
penny
he
spends
and
which
is
strange
the
goldsmiths
with
whom
i
spoke
do
declare
that
they
will
not
be
moved
to
part
with
money
upon
the
increase
of
their
consideration
of
ten
per
cent
which
they
have
i
find
all
the
town
almost
going
out
of
town
the
coaches
and
waggons
being
all
full
of
people
going
into
the
country
to
a
committee
for
tangier
where
unknown
to
me
comes
my
lord
of
sandwich
who
it
seems
come
to
town
last
night
after
the
committee
was
up
my
lord
sandwich
did
take
me
aside
in
the
telling
me
how
much
the
duke
and
coventry
did
both
in
the
fleet
and
here
make
of
him
and
that
in
some
opposition
to
the
prince
and
as
a
more
private
message
he
told
me
that
he
hath
been
with
them
both
when
they
have
made
sport
of
the
prince
and
laughed
at
him
yet
that
all
the
discourse
of
the
town
and
the
printed
relation
should
not
give
him
one
word
of
honour
my
lord
thinks
very
strange
he
assuring
me
that
though
by
accident
the
prince
was
in
the
van
in
the
beginning
of
the
fight
for
the
first
pass
yet
all
the
rest
of
the
day
my
lord
was
in
the
van
and
continued
so
that
notwithstanding
all
this
noise
of
the
prince
he
had
hardly
a
shot
in
his
side
or
a
man
killed
whereas
he
above
in
her
hull
and
not
one
mast
whole
nor
yard
but
the
most
battered
ship
of
the
fleet
and
lost
most
men
saving
captain
smith
of
the
mary
that
the
most
the
duke
did
was
almost
out
of
but
that
indeed
the
duke
did
come
up
to
my
lord
rescue
after
he
had
a
great
while
fought
with
four
of
them
how
poorly
sir
john
lawson
performed
notwithstanding
all
that
was
said
of
him
and
how
his
ship
turned
out
of
the
way
while
sir
lawson
himself
was
upon
the
deck
to
the
endangering
of
the
whole
fleet
from
that
discourse
my
lord
did
begin
to
tell
me
how
much
he
was
concerned
to
dispose
of
his
children
and
would
have
my
advice
and
help
and
propounded
to
match
my
lady
jemimah
to
sir
carteret
eldest
son
philip
carteret
afterwards
knighted
he
perished
on
board
lord
sandwich
flag
ship
at
the
battle
of
solebay
which
i
approved
of
and
did
undertake
the
speaking
with
him
about
it
as
from
myself
which
my
lord
liked
home
by
which
is
become
a
very
dangerous
passage
the
sickness
encreasing
mightily
to
clerke
and
there
i
in
the
best
manner
i
could
broke
my
errand
about
a
match
between
sir
carteret
eldest
son
and
my
lord
sandwich
eldest
daughter
which
he
as
i
knew
he
would
took
with
great
content
and
he
did
undertake
to
find
out
sir
george
this
morning
and
put
the
business
in
execution
so
i
to
white
hall
where
i
with
creed
and
povy
attended
my
lord
treasurer
and
did
prevail
with
him
to
let
us
have
an
assignment
for
or
which
i
hope
will
do
our
business
for
tangier
to
sir
carteret
and
in
the
best
manner
i
could
moved
the
business
he
received
it
with
great
respect
and
content
and
thanks
to
me
and
promised
that
he
would
do
what
he
possibly
could
for
his
son
to
render
him
fit
for
my
daughter
and
showed
great
kindness
to
me
and
sense
of
my
kindness
to
him
herein
sir
william
pen
told
me
this
day
that
coventry
is
to
be
sworn
a
privy
counsellor
at
which
my
soul
is
glad
to
white
hall
where
after
i
again
visited
carteret
and
received
his
and
now
his
lady
full
content
in
my
proposal
my
lord
sandwich
did
direct
me
to
return
to
sir
carteret
and
give
him
thanks
for
his
kind
acceptation
of
this
offer
and
that
he
would
the
next
day
be
willing
to
enter
discourse
with
him
shout
the
business
my
lord
i
perceive
intends
to
give
with
her
and
expects
about
per
annum
joynture
to
greenwich
by
water
thinking
to
have
visited
sir
lawson
where
when
i
come
i
find
that
he
died
this
morning
and
indeed
the
nation
hath
a
great
loss
coventry
among
other
talk
entered
about
the
great
question
now
in
the
house
about
the
duke
going
to
sea
again
about
which
the
whole
house
is
divided
the
plague
encreases
mightily
i
this
day
seeing
a
house
at
a
over
against
church
in
the
open
street
shut
up
which
is
a
sad
sight
i
did
take
my
leave
of
sir
william
coventry
who
it
seems
was
knighted
and
sworn
a
two
days
since
who
with
his
old
kindness
treated
me
and
i
believe
i
shall
ever
find
a
noble
friend
in
my
way
to
westminster
hall
i
observed
several
plague
houses
in
king
street
and
the
palace
to
white
hall
where
the
court
full
of
waggons
and
people
ready
to
go
out
of
town
this
end
of
the
town
every
day
grows
very
bad
of
the
plague
the
mortality
bill
is
come
to
which
is
about
ninety
more
than
the
last
and
of
these
but
four
in
the
city
which
is
a
great
blessing
to
us
took
leave
again
of
coventry
though
i
hope
the
duke
is
not
gone
to
stay
and
so
do
others
too
home
calling
at
somerset
house
where
all
were
packing
up
too
the
queene
mother
setting
out
for
france
this
day
to
drink
bourbon
waters
this
year
she
being
in
a
consumption
and
intends
not
to
come
till
winter
come
months
thus
this
book
of
two
years
ends
myself
and
family
in
good
health
consisting
of
myself
and
wife
mercer
her
woman
mary
alice
and
susan
our
maids
and
tom
my
boy
in
a
sickly
time
of
the
plague
growing
on
having
upon
my
hands
the
troublesome
care
of
the
treasury
of
tangier
with
great
sums
drawn
upon
me
and
nothing
to
pay
them
with
also
the
business
of
the
office
great
considering
of
removing
my
wife
to
woolwich
she
lately
busy
in
learning
to
paint
with
great
pleasure
and
successe
all
other
things
well
especially
a
new
interest
i
am
making
by
a
match
in
hand
between
the
eldest
son
of
sir
carteret
and
my
lady
jemimah
montagu
the
duke
of
york
gone
down
to
the
fleet
but
all
suppose
not
with
intent
to
stay
there
as
it
is
not
fit
all
men
conceive
he
should
july
sad
at
the
news
that
seven
or
eight
houses
in
burying
hall
probably
basinghall
street
are
shut
up
of
the
plague
sir
carteret
did
send
me
word
that
the
business
between
my
lord
and
him
is
fully
agreed
on
and
is
mightily
liked
of
by
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
sir
lawson
was
buried
late
last
night
at
dunstan
by
us
without
any
company
at
all
i
hear
this
day
the
duke
and
prince
rupert
are
both
come
back
from
sea
and
neither
of
them
go
back
again
coventry
tells
me
how
matters
are
ordered
in
the
fleet
my
lord
sandwich
goes
admiral
under
him
sir
ascue
and
sir
teddiman
vice
admiral
sir
pen
and
under
him
sir
barkeley
and
sir
jos
jordan
sir
thomas
allen
and
under
him
sir
christopher
mings
and
captain
harman
walked
round
to
white
hall
the
park
being
quite
locked
up
and
i
observed
a
house
shut
up
this
day
in
the
pell
mell
where
heretofore
in
cromwell
time
we
young
men
used
to
keep
our
weekly
clubs
alderman
backewell
is
ordered
abroad
upon
some
private
score
with
a
great
sum
of
money
wherein
i
was
instrumental
the
other
day
in
shipping
him
away
it
seems
some
of
his
creditors
have
taken
notice
of
it
and
he
was
like
to
be
broke
yesterday
in
his
absence
sir
carteret
telling
me
that
the
king
and
the
kingdom
must
as
good
as
fall
with
that
man
at
this
time
and
that
he
was
forced
to
get
himself
to
answer
people
occasions
or
he
must
have
broke
but
committed
this
to
me
as
a
great
secret
i
could
not
see
lord
brouncker
nor
had
much
mind
one
of
the
great
houses
within
two
doors
of
him
being
shut
up
and
lord
the
number
of
houses
visited
which
this
day
i
observed
through
the
town
quite
round
in
my
way
by
long
lane
and
london
wall
sir
pen
it
seems
sailed
last
night
from
solebay
with
about
sixty
sail
of
ship
and
my
lord
sandwich
in
the
prince
and
some
others
it
seems
going
after
them
to
overtake
them
at
this
time
i
have
two
tierces
of
claret
two
quarter
casks
of
canary
and
a
smaller
vessel
of
sack
a
vessel
of
tent
another
of
malaga
and
another
of
white
wine
all
in
my
wine
cellar
together
i
took
occasion
to
have
much
discourse
with
ph
carteret
and
find
him
a
very
modest
man
and
i
think
verily
of
mighty
good
nature
and
pretty
understanding
he
did
give
me
a
good
account
of
the
fight
with
the
dutch
having
promised
harman
yesterday
i
to
his
house
the
most
observable
thing
i
found
there
to
my
content
was
to
hear
him
and
his
clerk
tell
me
that
in
this
parish
of
michell
cornhill
one
of
the
parishes
and
a
great
one
of
the
town
there
hath
notwithstanding
this
sickness
been
buried
of
any
disease
man
woman
or
child
not
one
for
thirteen
months
last
past
which
is
very
strange
and
the
like
in
a
good
degree
in
most
other
parishes
i
hear
saving
only
of
the
plague
in
them
a
solemn
for
the
plague
growing
upon
us
above
died
of
the
plague
this
week
i
by
water
to
sir
carteret
and
there
find
my
lady
sandwich
buying
things
for
my
lady
jem
wedding
and
my
lady
jem
is
beyond
expectation
come
to
dagenham
dagenhams
near
romford
now
belonging
to
sir
thomas
neave
bart
this
estate
was
devised
by
anne
rider
only
surviving
child
of
sir
henry
wright
to
her
relative
and
friend
edward
carteret
whose
daughters
in
sold
it
to
henry
muilman
esq
in
it
was
again
disposed
of
to
neave
father
of
the
present
proprietor
who
pulled
down
the
old
house
built
by
sir
and
erected
the
present
mansion
on
a
different
site
vide
lysons
environs
where
carteret
is
to
go
to
visit
her
and
my
proposal
of
waiting
on
him
he
being
to
go
alone
to
all
persons
strangers
to
him
was
well
accepted
and
so
i
go
with
him
but
lord
to
see
how
kind
my
lady
carteret
is
to
her
sends
her
most
rich
jewells
and
provides
bedding
and
things
of
all
sorts
most
richly
for
her
carteret
and
i
to
the
at
greenwich
and
there
staid
an
hour
crossing
the
water
to
and
again
to
get
our
coach
and
horses
over
and
by
and
by
set
out
and
so
toward
dagenhams
but
lord
what
silly
discourse
we
had
as
to
matters
he
being
the
most
awkerd
man
ever
i
met
with
in
my
life
as
to
that
business
thither
we
come
and
by
that
time
it
begun
to
be
dark
and
were
kindly
received
by
lady
wright
and
my
lord
crewe
and
to
discourse
they
went
my
lord
discoursing
with
him
asking
of
him
questions
of
travell
which
he
answered
well
enough
in
a
few
words
but
nothing
to
the
lady
from
him
at
all
to
supper
and
after
supper
to
talk
again
he
yet
taking
no
notice
of
the
lady
my
lord
would
have
had
me
have
consented
to
leaving
the
young
people
together
to
begin
their
amours
his
staying
being
but
to
be
little
but
i
advised
against
it
lest
the
lady
might
be
too
much
surprised
so
they
led
him
up
to
his
chamber
where
i
staid
a
little
to
know
how
he
liked
the
lady
which
he
told
me
he
did
mightily
but
lord
in
the
dullest
insipid
manner
that
ever
lover
did
so
i
bid
him
good
night
and
down
to
prayers
with
my
lord
crewe
family
and
after
prayers
my
lord
and
lady
wright
and
i
to
consult
what
to
do
and
it
was
agreed
at
last
to
have
them
go
to
church
together
as
the
family
used
to
do
though
his
lameness
was
a
great
objection
against
it
lord
day
i
up
having
lain
with
moore
in
the
chaplin
chamber
and
having
trimmed
myself
down
to
carteret
and
we
walked
in
the
gallery
an
hour
or
two
it
being
a
most
noble
and
pretty
house
that
ever
for
the
bigness
i
saw
here
i
taught
him
what
to
do
to
take
the
lady
always
by
the
hand
to
lead
her
and
telling
him
that
i
would
find
opportunity
to
leave
them
together
he
should
make
these
and
these
compliments
and
also
take
a
time
to
do
the
like
to
lord
crewe
and
lady
wright
after
i
had
instructed
him
which
he
thanked
me
for
owning
that
he
needed
my
teaching
him
my
lord
crewe
come
down
and
family
the
young
lady
among
the
rest
and
so
by
coaches
to
church
four
miles
off
where
a
pretty
good
sermon
and
a
declaration
of
penitence
of
a
man
that
had
undergone
the
churche
censure
for
his
wicked
life
thence
back
again
by
coach
carteret
having
not
had
the
confidence
to
take
his
lady
once
by
the
hand
coming
or
going
which
i
told
him
of
when
we
come
home
and
he
will
hereafter
do
it
so
to
dinner
my
lord
excellent
discourse
then
to
walk
in
the
gallery
and
to
sit
down
by
and
by
my
lady
wright
and
i
go
out
and
then
my
lord
crewe
he
not
by
design
and
lastly
my
lady
creme
come
out
and
left
the
young
people
together
and
a
little
pretty
daughter
of
my
lady
wright
most
innocently
come
out
afterwards
and
shut
the
door
to
as
if
she
had
done
it
poor
child
by
inspiration
which
made
us
without
have
good
sport
to
laugh
at
they
together
an
hour
and
by
and
by
whither
he
led
her
into
the
coach
and
into
the
church
where
several
handsome
ladies
but
it
was
most
extraordinary
hot
that
ever
i
knew
it
anon
to
supper
and
excellent
discourse
and
dispute
between
my
lord
crewe
and
the
chaplin
who
is
a
good
scholler
but
a
nonconformist
here
this
evening
i
spoke
with
carter
my
old
acquaintance
that
hath
lived
with
my
lady
these
twelve
or
thirteen
years
the
sum
of
all
whose
discourse
and
others
for
her
is
that
i
would
get
her
a
good
husband
which
i
have
promised
but
know
not
when
i
shall
perform
after
carteret
was
carried
to
his
chamber
we
to
prayers
and
then
to
bed
up
all
of
us
and
to
billiards
my
lady
wright
carteret
myself
and
every
body
by
and
by
the
young
couple
left
together
anon
to
dinner
and
after
dinner
carteret
took
my
advice
about
giving
to
the
servants
among
them
before
we
went
i
took
my
lady
jem
apart
and
would
know
how
she
liked
this
gentleman
and
whether
she
was
under
any
difficulty
concerning
him
she
blushed
and
hid
her
face
awhile
but
at
last
i
forced
her
to
tell
me
she
answered
that
she
could
readily
obey
what
her
father
and
mother
had
done
which
was
all
she
could
say
or
i
expect
so
anon
took
leave
and
for
london
in
our
way
carteret
did
give
me
mighty
thanks
for
my
care
and
pains
for
him
and
is
mightily
pleased
i
was
much
troubled
this
day
to
hear
at
westminster
how
the
officers
do
bury
the
dead
in
the
open
pretending
want
of
room
elsewhere
whereas
the
new
chapel
was
at
the
publick
charge
in
the
last
merely
for
want
of
room
and
now
none
but
such
as
are
able
to
pay
dear
for
it
can
be
buried
there
walked
to
redriffe
where
i
hear
the
sickness
is
and
indeed
is
scattered
almost
every
where
there
dying
of
the
plague
this
week
my
lady
carteret
did
this
day
give
me
a
bottle
of
home
with
me
i
received
yesterday
a
letter
from
my
lord
sandwich
giving
me
thanks
for
my
care
about
their
marriage
business
and
desiring
it
to
be
dispatched
that
no
disappointment
may
happen
therein
late
in
my
chamber
setting
some
papers
in
order
the
plague
growing
very
ranging
and
my
apprehensions
of
it
great
the
duke
of
albemarle
being
gone
to
dinner
to
my
lord
of
canterbury
i
thither
and
there
walked
and
viewed
the
new
hall
a
new
hall
as
possible
begun
and
means
left
for
the
ending
of
it
by
bishop
juxon
to
where
to
the
spring
garden
but
i
do
not
see
one
guest
there
the
town
being
so
empty
of
any
body
to
come
thither
i
by
coach
home
not
meeting
with
but
two
coaches
and
but
two
carts
from
white
hall
to
my
own
house
that
i
could
observe
and
the
streets
mighty
thin
of
people
all
the
news
is
great
that
we
must
of
necessity
fall
out
with
france
for
he
will
side
with
the
dutch
against
us
that
alderman
backewell
is
gone
over
which
indeed
he
is
with
money
and
that
ostend
is
in
our
present
possession
but
it
is
strange
to
see
how
poor
alderman
backewell
is
like
to
be
put
to
it
in
his
absence
shaw
his
right
hand
being
and
the
alderman
absence
gives
doubts
to
people
and
i
perceive
they
are
in
great
straits
for
money
besides
what
sir
carteret
told
me
about
fourteen
days
ago
our
fleet
under
my
lord
sandwich
being
about
the
latitude
which
is
a
great
secret
to
the
northward
of
the
texell
to
hampton
court
where
i
followed
the
king
to
chapel
and
there
heard
a
good
sermon
and
after
sermon
with
my
lord
arlington
sir
thomas
ingram
and
others
spoke
to
the
duke
about
tangier
but
not
to
much
purpose
i
was
not
invited
any
whither
to
dinner
though
a
stranger
which
did
also
trouble
me
but
yet
i
must
remember
it
is
a
court
and
indeed
where
most
are
strangers
but
however
cutler
carried
me
to
marriott
the
and
there
we
had
a
very
good
dinner
and
good
company
among
others
lilly
the
painter
i
find
carteret
yet
as
backward
almost
in
his
caresses
as
he
was
the
first
day
sad
the
story
of
the
plague
in
the
city
it
growing
mightily
this
day
my
lord
brouncker
did
give
me
book
upon
the
bills
of
mortality
new
printed
and
enlarged
this
day
came
a
letter
to
me
from
paris
from
my
lord
hinchingbroke
about
his
coming
over
and
i
have
sent
this
night
an
order
from
the
duke
of
albemarle
for
a
ship
of
guns
to
go
to
calais
to
fetch
him
to
greenwich
to
the
park
where
i
heard
the
king
and
duke
are
come
by
water
this
morn
from
hampton
court
they
asked
me
several
questions
the
king
mightily
pleased
with
his
new
buildings
there
i
followed
them
to
castle
ship
in
building
and
there
met
sir
batten
and
thence
to
sir
carteret
where
all
the
morning
with
them
they
not
having
any
but
the
duke
of
monmouth
and
sir
killigrew
to
the
queen
and
one
gentleman
and
a
page
more
great
variety
of
talk
and
was
often
led
to
speak
to
the
king
and
duke
by
and
by
they
to
dinner
and
all
to
dinner
and
sat
down
to
the
king
saving
myself
the
king
having
dined
he
came
down
and
i
went
in
the
barge
with
him
i
sitting
at
the
door
down
to
woolwich
and
there
i
just
saw
and
kissed
my
wife
and
saw
some
of
her
painting
which
is
very
curious
and
away
again
to
the
king
and
back
again
with
him
in
the
barge
hearing
him
and
the
duke
talk
and
seeing
and
observing
their
manner
of
discourse
and
god
forgive
me
though
i
admire
them
with
all
the
duty
possible
yet
the
more
a
man
considers
and
observes
them
the
less
he
finds
of
difference
between
them
and
other
men
though
blessed
be
god
they
are
both
princes
of
great
nobleness
and
spirits
the
duke
of
monmouth
is
the
most
skittish
leaping
gallant
that
ever
i
saw
always
in
action
vaulting
or
leaping
or
clambering
sad
news
of
the
death
of
so
many
in
the
parish
of
the
plague
forty
last
night
the
bell
always
going
this
day
poor
robin
shaw
at
backewell
died
and
backewell
himself
in
flanders
the
king
himself
asked
about
shaw
and
being
told
he
was
dead
said
he
was
very
sorry
for
it
the
sickness
is
got
into
our
parish
this
week
and
is
got
indeed
every
where
so
that
i
begin
to
think
of
setting
things
in
order
which
i
pray
god
enable
me
to
put
both
as
to
soul
and
body
to
hampton
court
where
i
saw
the
king
and
queene
set
out
towards
salisbury
and
after
them
the
duke
and
duchesse
whose
hands
i
did
kiss
and
it
was
the
first
time
i
did
ever
or
did
see
any
body
else
kiss
her
hand
and
it
was
a
most
fine
white
and
fat
hand
but
it
was
pretty
to
see
the
young
pretty
ladies
dressed
like
men
in
velvet
coats
caps
with
ribbands
and
with
laced
bands
just
like
men
only
the
duchesse
herself
it
did
not
become
at
home
met
the
weekly
bill
where
above
encreased
in
the
bill
and
of
them
in
all
about
of
the
plague
which
hath
made
the
officers
this
day
resolve
of
sitting
at
deptford
which
puts
me
to
some
consideration
what
to
do
set
out
with
my
lady
sandwich
all
alone
with
her
with
six
horses
to
dagenhams
going
by
water
to
the
ferry
and
a
pleasant
going
and
a
good
discourse
and
when
there
very
merry
and
the
young
couple
now
well
acquainted
but
lord
to
see
in
what
fear
all
the
people
here
do
live
how
they
are
afraid
of
us
that
come
to
them
insomuch
that
i
am
troubled
at
it
and
wish
myself
away
but
some
cause
they
have
for
the
chaplin
with
whom
but
a
week
or
two
ago
we
were
here
mighty
high
disputing
is
since
fallen
into
a
fever
and
dead
being
gone
hence
to
a
friend
a
good
way
off
a
sober
and
a
healthful
man
these
considerations
make
us
all
hasten
the
marriage
and
resolve
it
upon
monday
next
it
was
a
sad
noise
to
hear
our
bell
to
toll
and
ring
so
often
either
for
death
or
burials
i
think
five
or
six
times
up
and
very
betimes
by
six
at
deptford
and
there
find
sir
carteret
and
my
lady
ready
to
go
i
being
in
my
new
coloured
silk
suit
and
coat
trimmed
with
gold
buttons
and
gold
broad
lace
round
my
hands
very
rich
and
fine
by
water
to
the
ferry
where
when
we
come
no
coach
there
and
tide
of
ebb
so
far
spent
as
the
could
not
get
off
on
the
other
side
the
river
to
bring
away
the
coach
so
we
were
fain
to
stay
there
in
the
unlucky
isle
of
doggs
in
a
chill
place
the
morning
cool
and
wind
fresh
above
two
if
not
three
hours
to
our
great
discontent
yet
being
upon
a
pleasant
errand
and
seeing
that
it
could
not
be
helped
we
did
bear
it
very
patiently
and
it
was
worth
my
observing
to
see
how
upon
these
two
scores
sir
carteret
the
most
passionate
man
in
the
world
and
that
was
in
greatest
haste
to
be
gone
did
bear
with
it
and
very
pleasant
all
the
while
at
least
not
troubled
much
so
as
to
fret
and
storm
at
it
anon
the
coach
comes
in
the
mean
time
there
coming
a
news
thither
with
his
horse
to
go
over
that
told
us
he
did
come
from
islington
this
morning
and
that
proctor
the
vintner
of
the
miter
in
and
his
son
are
dead
this
morning
there
of
the
plague
he
having
laid
out
abundance
of
money
there
and
was
the
greatest
vintner
for
some
time
in
london
for
great
entertainments
we
fearing
the
canonicall
hour
would
be
past
before
we
got
thither
did
with
a
great
deal
of
unwillingness
send
away
the
licence
and
so
that
when
we
come
though
we
drove
hard
with
six
horses
yet
we
found
them
gone
from
home
and
going
towards
the
church
met
them
coming
from
church
which
troubled
us
but
however
that
trouble
was
soon
over
hearing
it
was
well
done
they
being
both
in
their
old
clothes
my
lord
crewe
giving
her
there
being
three
coach
fulls
of
them
the
young
lady
mighty
sad
which
troubled
me
but
yet
i
think
it
was
only
her
gravity
in
a
little
greater
degree
than
usual
all
saluted
her
but
i
did
not
till
my
lady
sandwich
did
ask
me
whether
i
had
saluted
her
or
no
so
to
dinner
and
very
merry
we
were
but
in
such
a
sober
way
as
never
almost
any
thing
was
in
so
great
families
but
it
was
much
better
after
dinner
company
divided
some
to
cards
others
to
talk
my
lady
sandwich
and
i
up
to
settle
accounts
and
pay
her
some
money
and
mighty
kind
she
is
to
me
and
would
fain
have
had
me
gone
down
for
company
with
her
to
hinchingbroke
but
for
my
life
i
can
not
at
night
to
supper
and
so
to
talk
and
which
methought
was
the
most
extraordinary
thing
all
of
us
to
prayers
as
usual
and
the
young
bride
and
bridegroom
too
and
so
after
prayers
soberly
to
bed
only
i
got
into
the
bridegroom
chamber
while
he
undressed
himself
and
there
was
very
merry
till
he
was
called
to
the
bride
chamber
and
into
bed
they
went
i
kissed
the
bride
in
bed
and
so
the
curtaines
drawne
with
the
greatest
gravity
that
could
be
and
so
good
night
but
the
modesty
and
gravity
of
this
business
was
so
decent
that
it
was
to
me
indeed
ten
times
more
delightful
than
if
it
had
been
twenty
times
more
merry
and
jovial
thus
i
ended
this
month
with
the
greatest
joy
that
ever
i
did
any
in
my
life
because
i
have
spent
the
greatest
part
of
it
with
abundance
of
joy
and
honour
and
pleasant
journeys
and
brave
entertainments
and
without
cost
of
money
and
at
last
live
to
see
the
business
ended
with
great
content
on
all
sides
thus
we
end
this
month
as
i
said
after
the
greatest
glut
of
content
that
ever
i
had
only
under
some
difficulty
because
of
the
plague
which
grows
mightily
upon
us
the
last
week
being
about
or
of
the
plague
my
lord
sandwich
at
sea
with
a
fleet
of
about
sail
to
the
northward
expecting
de
ruyter
or
the
dutch
east
india
fleet
my
lord
hinchingbroke
coming
over
from
france
and
will
meet
his
sister
at
myself
having
obliged
both
these
families
in
this
business
very
much
as
both
my
lady
and
sir
carteret
and
his
lady
do
confess
exceedingly
and
the
latter
do
also
now
call
me
cozen
which
i
am
glad
of
so
god
preserve
us
all
friends
long
and
continue
health
among
us
august
to
dagenhams
all
the
way
people
citizens
walking
to
and
fro
enquire
how
the
plague
is
in
the
city
this
week
by
the
bill
which
by
chance
at
greenwich
i
had
heard
was
of
the
plague
and
and
odd
of
all
diseases
by
and
by
met
my
lord
crewe
returning
marr
telling
me
by
the
way
how
a
of
john
wright
who
lives
thereabouts
falling
sick
of
the
plague
she
was
removed
to
an
and
a
nurse
appointed
to
look
to
her
who
being
once
absent
the
maid
got
out
of
the
house
at
the
window
and
run
away
the
nurse
coming
and
knocking
and
having
no
answer
believed
she
was
dead
and
went
and
told
wright
so
who
and
his
lady
were
in
great
strait
what
to
do
to
get
her
buried
at
last
resolved
to
go
to
burntwood
hard
by
being
in
the
parish
and
there
get
people
to
do
it
but
they
would
not
so
he
went
home
full
of
trouble
and
in
the
way
met
the
wench
walking
over
the
common
which
frighted
him
worse
than
before
and
was
forced
to
send
people
to
take
her
which
he
did
and
they
got
one
of
the
pest
coaches
and
put
her
into
it
to
carry
her
to
a
pest
house
and
passing
in
a
narrow
lane
sir
anthony
browne
he
commanded
a
troop
of
horse
in
the
with
his
brother
and
some
friends
in
the
coach
met
this
coach
with
the
curtains
drawn
close
the
brother
being
a
young
man
and
believing
there
might
be
some
lady
in
it
that
would
not
be
seen
and
the
way
being
narrow
he
thrust
his
head
out
of
his
own
into
her
coach
and
to
look
and
there
saw
somebody
look
very
ill
and
in
a
sick
dress
and
stunk
mightily
which
the
coachman
also
cried
out
upon
and
presently
they
come
up
to
some
people
that
stood
looking
after
it
and
told
our
gallants
that
it
was
a
maid
of
wright
carried
away
sick
of
the
plague
which
put
the
young
gentle
man
into
a
fright
had
almost
cost
him
his
life
but
is
now
well
again
i
am
told
of
a
great
ryott
upon
thursday
last
in
cheapside
colonel
danvers
a
delinquent
having
been
taken
and
in
his
way
to
the
tower
was
rescued
from
the
captain
of
the
guard
and
carried
away
one
only
of
the
rescuers
being
taken
to
my
office
a
little
and
then
to
the
duke
of
about
some
business
the
streets
empty
all
the
way
now
even
in
london
which
is
a
sad
sight
and
to
westminster
hall
where
talking
hearing
very
sad
stories
from
mumford
among
others
of
michell
son
family
and
poor
will
that
used
to
sell
us
ale
at
the
his
wife
and
three
children
died
all
i
think
in
a
day
so
home
through
the
city
again
wishing
i
may
have
taken
no
ill
in
going
but
i
will
go
i
think
no
more
thither
the
news
of
de
ruyter
coming
home
is
certain
and
told
to
the
great
disadvantage
of
our
fleet
and
the
praise
of
de
ruyter
but
it
can
not
be
helped
by
and
by
to
the
office
where
we
sat
all
the
morning
in
great
trouble
to
see
the
bill
this
week
rise
so
high
to
above
in
all
and
of
them
above
of
the
plague
home
to
draw
over
anew
my
will
which
i
had
bound
myself
by
oath
to
dispatch
by
tomorrow
night
the
town
growing
so
unhealthy
that
a
man
can
not
depend
upon
living
two
days
the
people
die
so
that
now
it
seems
they
are
fain
to
carry
the
dead
to
be
buried
by
the
nights
not
sufficing
to
do
it
in
and
my
lord
mayor
commands
people
to
be
within
at
nine
at
night
all
as
they
say
that
the
sick
may
have
liberty
to
go
abroad
for
ayre
there
is
one
also
dead
out
of
one
of
our
ships
at
deptford
which
troubles
us
mightily
the
providence
which
was
just
fitted
to
go
to
sea
but
they
tell
me
no
more
sick
on
board
and
this
day
bodham
tells
me
that
one
is
dead
at
woolwich
not
far
from
the
i
am
told
too
that
a
wife
of
one
of
the
groomes
at
court
is
dead
at
salisbury
so
that
the
king
and
queene
are
speedily
to
be
all
gone
to
milton
so
god
preserve
us
it
was
dark
before
i
could
get
home
and
so
land
at
stairs
where
to
my
great
trouble
i
met
a
dead
corps
of
the
plague
in
the
narrow
ally
just
bringing
down
a
little
pair
of
stairs
but
i
thank
god
i
was
not
much
disturbed
at
it
however
i
shall
beware
of
being
late
abroad
again
to
the
exchange
where
i
have
not
been
a
great
while
but
lord
how
sad
a
sight
it
is
to
see
the
streets
empty
of
people
and
very
few
upon
the
jealous
of
every
door
that
one
sees
shut
up
lest
it
should
be
the
plague
and
about
us
two
shops
in
three
if
not
more
generally
shut
up
this
day
i
had
the
ill
news
from
dagenhams
that
my
poor
lord
of
hinchingbroke
his
indisposition
is
turned
to
the
poor
gentleman
that
he
should
be
come
from
france
so
soon
to
fall
sick
and
of
that
disease
too
when
he
should
be
gone
to
see
a
fine
lady
his
mistress
i
am
most
heartily
sorry
for
it
to
sheernesse
where
we
walked
up
and
down
laying
out
the
ground
to
be
taken
in
for
a
yard
to
lay
provisions
for
cleaning
and
repairing
of
ships
and
a
most
proper
place
it
is
for
the
purpose
come
letters
from
the
king
and
lord
arlington
for
the
removal
of
our
office
to
greenwich
i
also
wrote
letters
and
made
myself
ready
to
go
to
sir
carteret
at
windsor
and
having
borrowed
a
horse
of
blackbrough
sent
him
to
wait
for
me
at
the
duke
of
albemarle
door
when
on
a
sudden
a
letter
comes
to
us
from
the
duke
of
albemarle
to
tell
us
that
the
fleet
is
all
come
back
to
solebay
and
are
presently
to
be
dispatched
back
again
whereupon
i
presently
by
water
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
to
know
what
news
and
there
i
saw
a
letter
from
my
lord
sandwich
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
also
from
sir
coventry
and
captain
teddiman
how
my
lord
having
commanded
teddiman
with
ships
of
which
but
fifteen
could
get
thither
and
of
those
fifteen
but
eight
or
nine
could
come
up
to
play
to
go
to
bergen
where
after
several
messages
to
and
fro
from
the
governor
of
the
castle
urging
that
teddiman
ought
not
to
come
thither
with
more
than
five
ships
and
desiring
time
to
think
of
it
all
the
while
he
suffering
the
dutch
ships
to
land
their
guns
to
the
best
advantage
teddiman
on
the
second
presence
began
to
play
at
the
dutch
ships
whereof
ten
east
and
in
three
hours
time
the
town
and
castle
without
any
provocation
playing
on
our
ships
they
did
cut
all
our
cables
so
as
the
wind
being
off
the
land
did
force
us
to
go
out
and
rendered
our
useless
without
doing
any
thing
but
what
hurt
of
course
our
guns
must
have
done
them
we
having
lost
five
commanders
besides
edward
montagu
and
windham
our
fleet
is
come
home
to
our
great
grief
with
not
above
five
weeks
dry
and
six
days
wet
provisions
however
must
go
out
again
and
the
duke
hath
ordered
the
soveraigne
and
all
other
ships
ready
to
go
out
to
the
fleet
and
strengthen
them
this
news
troubles
us
all
but
can
not
be
helped
having
read
all
this
news
and
received
commands
of
the
duke
with
great
content
he
giving
me
the
words
which
to
my
great
joy
he
hath
several
times
said
to
me
that
his
greatest
reliance
is
upon
me
and
my
lord
craven
also
did
come
out
to
talk
with
me
and
told
me
that
i
am
in
mighty
esteem
with
the
duke
for
which
i
bless
god
home
and
having
given
my
an
account
hereof
to
chatham
and
wrote
other
letters
i
by
water
to
to
the
and
there
the
people
tell
me
they
are
shut
up
and
so
i
went
to
the
new
and
there
got
a
guide
and
horses
to
hounslow
so
to
stanes
and
there
by
this
time
it
was
dark
night
and
got
a
guide
who
lost
his
way
in
the
forest
till
by
help
of
the
moone
which
recompences
me
for
all
the
pains
i
ever
took
about
studying
of
her
motions
i
led
my
guide
into
the
way
back
again
and
so
we
made
a
man
rise
that
kept
a
gate
and
so
he
carried
us
to
cranborne
one
of
the
lodges
belonging
to
the
crown
in
windsor
forest
where
in
the
dark
i
perceive
an
old
house
new
building
with
a
great
deal
of
rubbish
and
was
fain
to
go
up
a
ladder
to
sir
carteret
chamber
and
there
in
his
bed
i
sat
down
and
told
him
all
my
bad
news
which
troubled
him
mightily
but
yet
we
were
very
merry
and
made
the
best
of
it
and
being
myself
weary
did
take
leave
and
after
having
spoken
with
fenn
nicholas
fenne
is
mentioned
as
a
commissioner
of
the
victualling
office
pepys
ms
letters
in
bed
i
to
bed
in
my
lady
chamber
that
she
uses
to
lie
in
and
where
the
duchesse
of
york
that
now
is
was
born
so
to
sleep
being
very
well
but
weary
and
the
better
by
having
carried
with
me
a
bottle
of
strong
water
whereof
now
and
then
a
sip
did
me
good
i
up
and
to
walk
forth
to
see
the
place
and
i
find
it
to
be
a
very
noble
seat
in
a
noble
forest
with
the
noblest
prospect
towards
windsor
and
round
about
over
many
countys
that
can
be
desired
but
otherwise
a
very
melancholy
place
and
little
variety
save
only
trees
to
brainford
and
there
at
the
inn
that
goes
down
to
the
waterside
i
light
and
paid
off
my
and
so
slipped
on
my
shoes
and
laid
my
things
by
the
tide
not
serving
and
to
church
where
a
dull
sermon
and
many
londoners
after
church
to
my
inn
and
eat
and
drank
and
so
about
seven
by
water
and
got
between
nine
and
ten
to
queenhive
queenhythe
very
dark
and
i
could
not
get
my
waterman
to
go
elsewhere
for
fear
of
the
plague
thence
with
a
lanthorn
in
great
fear
of
meeting
of
dead
corpses
carrying
to
be
buried
but
blessed
be
god
met
none
but
did
see
now
and
then
a
linke
which
is
the
mark
of
them
at
a
distance
i
went
away
and
walked
to
greenwich
in
my
way
seeing
a
coffin
with
a
dead
body
therein
dead
of
the
plague
lying
in
an
open
close
belonging
to
coome
farme
which
was
carried
out
last
night
and
the
parish
have
not
appointed
any
body
to
bury
it
but
only
set
a
watch
there
all
day
and
night
that
nobody
should
go
thither
or
come
thence
this
disease
making
us
more
cruel
to
one
another
than
we
are
to
dogs
this
day
i
am
told
that
burnett
my
physician
is
this
morning
dead
of
the
plague
which
is
strange
his
man
dying
so
long
ago
and
his
house
this
month
open
again
now
himself
dead
poor
unfortunate
man
i
think
to
take
adieu
of
the
london
streets
in
much
the
best
posture
i
ever
was
in
in
my
life
both
as
to
the
quantity
and
the
certainty
i
have
of
the
money
i
am
worth
having
most
of
it
in
my
hand
but
then
this
is
a
trouble
to
me
what
to
do
with
it
being
myself
this
day
going
to
be
wholly
at
woolwich
but
for
the
present
i
am
resolved
to
venture
it
in
an
iron
chest
at
least
for
a
while
abroad
and
met
with
hadley
our
clerke
who
upon
my
asking
how
the
plague
goes
told
me
it
encreases
much
and
much
in
our
parish
for
says
he
there
died
nine
this
week
though
i
have
returned
but
six
which
is
a
very
ill
practice
and
makes
me
think
it
is
so
in
other
places
and
therefore
the
plague
much
greater
than
people
take
it
to
be
i
went
forth
and
walked
towards
moorefields
to
see
god
forgive
my
presumption
whether
i
could
see
any
dead
corpse
going
to
the
grave
but
as
god
would
have
it
did
not
but
lord
how
every
body
looks
and
discourse
in
the
street
is
of
death
and
nothing
else
and
few
people
going
up
and
down
that
the
town
is
like
a
place
distressed
and
forsaken
up
and
after
putting
several
things
in
order
to
my
removal
to
woolwich
the
plague
having
a
great
encrease
this
week
beyond
all
expectation
of
almost
making
the
general
bill
odd
and
the
plague
above
thus
this
month
ends
with
great
sadness
upon
the
publick
through
the
greatness
of
the
plague
every
where
through
the
kingdom
almost
every
day
sadder
and
sadder
news
of
its
encrease
in
the
city
died
this
week
and
of
them
of
the
plague
but
it
is
feared
that
the
true
number
of
the
dead
this
week
is
near
partly
from
the
poor
that
can
not
be
taken
notice
of
through
the
greatness
of
the
number
and
partly
from
the
quakers
and
others
that
will
not
have
any
bell
ring
for
them
our
fleet
gone
out
to
find
the
dutch
we
having
about
sail
in
our
fleet
and
in
them
the
soveraigne
one
so
that
it
is
a
better
fleet
than
the
former
with
which
the
duke
was
all
our
fear
is
that
the
dutch
should
be
got
in
before
them
which
would
be
a
very
great
sorrow
to
the
publick
and
to
me
particularly
for
my
lord
sandwich
sake
a
great
deal
of
money
being
spent
and
the
kingdom
not
in
a
condition
to
spare
nor
a
parliament
without
much
difficulty
to
meet
to
give
more
and
to
that
to
have
it
said
what
hath
been
done
by
our
late
fleets
as
to
myself
i
am
very
well
only
in
fear
of
the
plague
and
as
much
of
an
ague
by
being
forced
to
go
early
and
late
to
woolwich
and
my
family
to
lie
their
continually
my
late
gettings
have
been
very
great
to
my
great
content
and
am
likely
to
have
yet
a
few
more
profitable
jobbs
in
a
little
while
for
which
tangier
and
sir
warren
i
am
wholly
obliged
to
lord
day
up
and
put
on
my
coloured
silk
suit
very
fine
and
my
new
periwigg
bought
a
good
while
since
but
durst
not
wear
because
the
plague
was
in
westminster
when
i
bought
it
and
it
is
a
wonder
what
will
be
the
fashion
after
the
plague
is
done
as
to
periwiggs
for
nobody
will
dare
to
buy
any
haire
for
fear
of
the
infection
that
it
had
been
cut
off
the
heads
of
people
dead
of
the
plague
my
lord
brouncker
sir
minnes
and
i
up
to
the
vestry
at
the
desire
of
the
justices
of
the
peace
in
order
to
the
doing
something
for
the
keeping
of
the
plague
from
growing
but
lord
to
consider
the
madness
of
people
of
the
town
who
will
because
they
are
forbid
come
in
crowds
along
with
the
dead
corpses
to
see
them
buried
but
we
agreed
on
some
orders
for
the
prevention
thereof
among
other
stories
one
was
very
passionate
methought
of
a
complaint
brought
against
a
man
in
the
town
for
taking
a
child
from
london
from
an
infected
house
alderman
hooker
told
us
it
was
the
child
of
a
very
able
citizen
in
gracious
street
a
saddler
who
had
buried
all
the
rest
of
his
children
of
the
plague
and
himself
and
wife
now
being
shut
up
and
in
despair
of
escaping
did
desire
only
to
save
the
life
of
this
little
child
and
so
prevailed
to
have
it
received
into
the
arms
of
a
friend
who
brought
it
having
put
it
into
new
fresh
clothes
to
greenwich
where
upon
hearing
the
story
we
did
agree
it
should
be
permitted
to
be
received
and
kept
in
the
town
walked
home
my
lord
brouncker
giving
me
a
very
neat
cane
to
walk
with
but
it
troubled
me
to
pass
by
coome
farme
where
about
people
have
died
of
the
plague
after
dinner
comes
colonel
blunt
in
his
new
chariot
made
with
springs
as
that
was
of
wicker
wherein
a
while
since
we
rode
at
his
house
and
he
hath
rode
he
says
now
his
journey
many
miles
in
it
with
one
horse
and
any
coach
and
any
horse
and
so
easy
he
says
so
for
curiosity
i
went
into
it
to
try
it
and
up
the
hill
to
the
heath
and
over
the
and
found
it
pretty
well
but
not
so
easy
as
he
pretends
to
london
to
pack
up
more
things
and
there
i
saw
fires
burning
in
the
streets
as
it
is
through
the
whole
city
by
the
lord
mayor
order
thence
by
water
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
all
the
way
fires
on
each
side
of
the
thames
and
strange
to
see
in
broad
daylight
two
or
three
burials
upon
the
bankeside
one
at
the
very
heels
of
another
doubtless
all
of
the
plague
and
yet
at
least
forty
or
fifty
people
going
along
with
every
one
of
them
the
duke
mighty
pleasant
with
me
telling
me
that
he
is
certainly
informed
that
the
dutch
were
not
come
home
upon
the
instant
and
so
he
hopes
our
fleet
may
meet
with
them
to
the
tower
and
there
sent
for
the
weekly
bill
and
find
dead
in
all
and
of
them
of
the
plague
which
is
a
most
dreadful
number
and
shows
reason
to
fear
that
the
plague
hath
got
that
hold
that
it
will
yet
continue
amongst
us
to
swakely
swakeley

pleasant

he
took
us
up
and
down
with
great
respect
and
showed
us
all
his
house
and
grounds
and
it
is
a
place
not
very
moderne
in
the
garden
nor
house
but
the
most
uniforme
in
all
that
ever
i
saw
and
some
things
to
excess
pretty
to
see
over
the
screene
of
the

he
showed
me
a
black
boy
that
he
had
that
died
of
a
consumption
and
being
dead
he
caused
him
to
be
dried
in
an
oven
and
lies
there
entire
in
a
box
by
and
by
to
dinner
where
his
lady
i
find
yet
handsome
but
hath
been
a
very
handsome
woman
now

old

brought
him
near
and
now
lives
no
man
in
england
in
greater
plenty
and
commands
both
king
and
council
with
his
credit
he
gives
them
after
dinner
sir
robert
led
us
up
to
his
long
gallery
very
fine
above
stairs
and
better
or
such
furniture
i
never
did
see
a
most
pleasant
journey
we
had
back
povy
tells
me
by
a
letter
he
showed
me
that
the
king
is
not
nor
hath
been
of
late
very
well
but
quite
out
of
humour
and
as
some
think
in
a
consumption
and
weary
of
every
thing
he
showed
me
my
lord
arlington
house
that
he
was
born
in
in
a
towne
called
harlington
and
so
carried
me
through
a
most
pleasant
country
to
brainford
and
there
put
me
into
my
boat
and
good
night
so
i
wrapped
myself
warm
and
by
water
got
to
woolwich
about
one
in
the
morning
i
was
forced
to
get
a
bed
at
captain
cocke
where
i
find
sir
doyly
sir
william
doyly
of
shottisham
norfolk
knighted
created
baronet
for
yarmouth
ob
he
and
evelyn
were
at
this
time
appointed
commissioners
for
the
care
of
the
sick
and
wounded
seamen
and
prisoners
of
war
and
he
and
evelyn
at
supper
and
i
with
them
full
of
discourse
of
the
neglect
of
our
masters
the
great
officers
of
state
about
all
business
and
especially
that
of
money
having
now
some
thousands
prisoners
kept
to
no
purpose
at
a
great
charge
and
no
money
provided
almost
for
the
doing
of
it
we
fell
to
talk
largely
of
the
want
of
some
persons
understanding
to
look
after
businesses
but
all
goes
to
rack
for
says
captain
cocke
my
lord
treasurer
he
minds
his
ease
and
lets
things
go
how
they
will
if
he
can
have
his
per
annum
and
a
game
at
he
is
well
my
lord
chancellor
he
minds
getting
of
money
and
nothing
else
and
my
lord
ashly
will
rob
the
devil
and
the
alter
but
he
will
get
money
if
it
be
to
be
got
but
that
which
put
us
into
this
great
melancholy
was
news
brought
which
captain
cocke
reports
as
a
certain
truth
that
all
the
dutch
fleet
and
merchant
east
india
ships
are
got
every
one
in
from
bergen
the
of
this
month
sunday
last
which
will
make
us
all
ridiculous
lord
day
walked
home
being
forced
thereto
by
one
of
my
watermen
falling
sick
yesterday
and
it
was
god
great
mercy
i
did
not
go
by
water
with
them
yesterday
for
he
fell
sick
on
saturday
night
and
it
is
to
be
feared
of
the
plague
so
i
sent
him
away
to
london
with
his
family
but
another
boat
come
to
me
this
morning
my
wife
before
i
come
out
telling
me
the
ill
news
that
she
hears
that
her
father
is
very
ill
and
then
i
told
her
i
feared
of
the
plague
for
that
the
house
is
shut
up
and
so
she
much
troubled
and
did
desire
me
to
send
them
something
and
i
said
i
would
and
will
do
so
but
before
i
come
out
there
happened
news
to
come
to
me
by
an
expresse
from
coventry
telling
the
most
happy
news
of
my
lord
sandwich
meeting
with
part
of
the
dutch
his
taking
two
of
their
east
india
ships
and
six
or
seven
others
and
very
good
prizes
and
that
he
is
in
search
of
the
rest
of
the
fleet
which
he
hopes
to
find
upon
the
with
the
loss
only
of
the
hector
poor
captn
cuttle
to
greenwich
and
there
sending
away
andrews
i
to
captn
cocke
where
i
find
my
lord
brouncker
and
his
mistress
mrs
williams
and
sir
minnes
where
we
supped
there
was
also
sir
doyly
and
evelyn
but
the
receipt
of
this
news
did
put
us
all
into
such
an
extasy
of
joy
that
it
inspired
into
sir
minnes
and
evelyn
such
a
spirit
of
mirth
that
in
all
my
life
i
never
met
with
so
merry
a
two
hours
as
our
company
this
night
was
among
other
humours
evelyn
repeating
of
some
verses
made
up
of
nothing
but
the
various
acceptations
of
may
and
can
and
doing
it
so
aptly
upon
occasion
of
something
of
that
nature
and
so
fast
did
make
us
all
die
almost
with
laughing
and
did
so
stop
the
mouth
of
sir
minnes
in
the
middle
of
all
his
mirth
and
in
a
thing
agreeing
with
his
own
manner
of
genius
that
i
never
saw
any
man
so
in
all
my
life
and
sir
minnes
mirth
too
to
see
himself
was
the
crown
of
all
our
mirth
in
this
humour
we
sat
till
about
ten
at
night
and
so
my
lord
and
his
mistress
home
and
we
to
bed
my
lord
brouncker
sir
minnes
and
i
took
boat
and
in
my
lord
coach
to
sir
hickes
sir
william
hickes
created
a
baronet
ob
aged
his
was
called
ruckholts
or
rookwood
at
layton
in
essex
where
he
entertained
king
charles
ii
after
hunting
whither
by
and
by
my
lady
batten
and
sir
william
comes
it
is
a
good
seat
with
a
fair
grove
of
trees
by
it
and
the
remains
of
a
good
garden
but
so
let
to
run
to
ruine
both
house
and
every
thing
in
and
about
it
so
ill
furnished
and
miserably
looked
after
i
never
did
see
in
all
my
life
not
so
much
as
a
latch
to
his
door
which
saved
him
nothing
for
the
wind
blowing
into
the
room
for
want
thereof
flung
down
a
great
bow
pott
that
stood
upon
the
and
that
fell
upon
some
venice
glasses
and
did
him
a
crown
worth
of
hurt
he
did
give
us
the
meanest
dinner
of
beef
shoulder
and
umbles
of
venison
which
he
takes
away
from
the
keeper
of
the
forest
of
which
he
was
ranger
and
a
few
pigeons
and
all
in
the
meanest
manner
that
ever
i
did
see
to
the
basest
degree
i
was
only
pleased
at
a
very
fine
picture
of
the
when
she
was
young
by
vandike
a
very
good
picture
and
a
lovely
face
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
where
i
find
a
letter
of
the
from
solebay
from
my
lord
sandwich
of
the
fleet
meeting
with
about
eighteen
more
of
the
dutch
fleet
and
his
taking
of
most
of
them
and
the
messenger
says
they
had
taken
three
after
the
letter
was
wrote
and
sealed
which
being
and
the
fourteen
took
the
other
day
is
sail
some
of
which
are
good
and
others
rich
ships
and
having
taken
a
copy
of
my
lord
letter
i
away
toward
the
the
plague
being
all
thereabouts
here
my
news
was
highly
welcome
and
i
did
wonder
to
see
the
so
full
i
believe
people
but
not
a
man
or
merchant
of
any
fashion
but
plain
men
all
and
lord
to
see
how
i
did
endeavour
all
i
could
to
talk
with
as
few
as
i
could
there
being
now
no
observation
of
shutting
up
of
houses
infected
that
to
be
sure
we
do
converse
and
meet
with
people
that
have
the
plague
upon
them
i
spent
some
thoughts
upon
the
occurrences
of
this
day
giving
matter
for
as
much
content
on
one
hand
and
melancholy
on
another
as
any
day
in
all
my
life
for
the
first
the
finding
of
my
money
and
plate
and
all
safe
at
london
and
speeding
in
my
business
of
money
this
day
the
hearing
of
this
good
news
to
such
excess
after
so
great
a
despair
of
my
doing
any
thing
this
year
adding
to
that
the
decrease
of
and
more
which
is
the
first
decrease
we
have
yet
had
in
the
sickness
since
it
begun
and
great
hopes
that
the
next
week
it
will
be
greater
then
on
the
other
side
my
finding
that
though
the
bill
in
general
is
abated
yet
the
city
within
the
walls
is
encreased
and
likely
to
continue
so
and
is
close
to
our
house
there
my
meeting
dead
corpses
of
the
plague
carried
to
be
buried
close
to
me
at
through
the
city
in
street
to
see
a
person
sick
of
the
sores
carried
close
by
me
by
gracechurch
in
a
my
finding
the
angel
tavern
at
the
lower
end
of
shut
up
and
more
than
that
the
alehouse
at
the
and
more
than
that
that
the
person
was
then
dying
of
the
plague
when
i
was
last
there
a
little
while
ago
at
night
to
hear
that
poor
payne
my
waiter
had
buried
a
child
and
is
dying
himself
to
hear
that
a
labourer
i
sent
but
the
other
day
to
dagenhams
to
know
how
they
did
there
is
dead
of
the
plague
and
that
one
of
my
own
watermen
that
carried
me
daily
fell
sick
as
soon
as
he
had
landed
me
on
friday
morning
last
when
i
had
been
all
night
upon
the
water
and
i
believe
he
did
get
his
infection
that
day
at
brainford
and
is
now
dead
of
the
plague
to
hear
that
captain
lambert
and
cuttle
are
killed
in
the
taking
these
ships
and
that
sidney
montague
is
sick
of
a
desperate
fever
at
my
lady
carteret
at
to
hear
that
lewes
hath
another
daughter
sick
and
lastly
that
both
my
servants
hewer
and
tom
edwards
have
lost
their
fathers
both
in
sepulchre
parish
of
the
plague
this
week
do
put
me
into
great
apprehension
of
melancholy
and
with
good
reason
to
gravesend
in
the
bezan
yacht
and
there
come
to
anchor
for
all
night
by
break
of
day
we
come
to
within
sight
of
the
fleet
which
was
a
very
fine
thing
to
behold
being
above
ships
great
and
small
with
the
flag
ships
of
each
squadron
distinguished
by
their
several
flags
on
their
main
fore
or
mizen
masts
among
others
the
soveraigne
charles
and
prince
in
the
last
of
which
my
lord
sandwich
was
and
so
we
come
on
board
and
we
and
my
lord
sandwich
newly
up
in
his
very
well
he
received
us
kindly
telling
us
the
state
of
the
fleet
lacking
provisions
having
no
beer
at
all
nor
have
had
most
of
them
these
three
weeks
or
month
and
but
few
days
dry
provisions
and
indeed
he
tells
us
that
he
believes
no
fleet
was
ever
set
to
sea
in
so
ill
condition
of
provision
as
this
was
when
it
went
out
last
he
did
inform
us
in
the
business
of
bergen
so
as
to
let
us
see
how
the
judgment
of
the
world
is
not
to
be
depended
on
in
things
they
know
not
it
being
a
place
just
wide
enough
and
not
so
much
hardly
for
ships
to
go
through
to
it
the
sticking
in
the
very
rocks
he
do
not
upon
his
best
enquiry
find
reason
to
except
against
any
part
of
the
management
of
the
business
by
teddiman
he
having
staid
treating
no
longer
than
during
the
night
whiles
he
was
fitting
himself
to
fight
bringing
his
ship
and
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
longer
as
it
is
said
nor
could
more
ships
have
been
brought
to
play
as
is
thought
nor
could
men
be
landed
there
being
men
effectively
always
in
armes
of
the
danes
nor
says
he
could
we
expect
more
from
the
dane
than
he
did
it
being
impossible
to
set
fire
on
the
ships
but
it
must
burn
the
towne
but
that
wherein
the
dane
did
amisse
is
that
he
did
assist
them
the
dutch
all
the
time
while
he
was
treating
with
us
when
he
should
have
been
newtrall
to
us
both
but
however
he
did
demand
but
the
treaty
of
us
which
is
that
we
should
not
come
with
more
than
five
ships
a
flag
of
truce
is
said
and
confessed
by
my
lord
that
he
believes
it
was
hung
out
but
while
they
did
hang
it
out
they
did
shoot
at
us
so
that
it
was
not
seen
or
perhaps
they
would
not
cease
upon
sight
of
it
while
they
continued
actually
in
action
against
us
but
the
main
thing
my
lord
wonders
at
and
condemns
the
dane
for
is
that
the
blockhead
who
is
so
much
in
debt
to
the
hollander
having
now
a
treasure
more
by
much
than
all
his
crowne
was
worth
and
that
which
would
for
ever
have
beggared
the
hollander
should
not
take
this
time
to
break
with
the
hollander
and
thereby
pay
his
debt
which
must
have
been
forgiven
him
and
have
got
the
greatest
treasure
into
his
hands
that
ever
was
together
in
the
world
by
and
by
my
lord
took
me
aside
to
discourse
of
his
private
matters
who
was
very
free
with
me
touching
the
ill
condition
of
the
fleet
that
it
hath
been
in
and
the
good
fortune
that
he
hath
had
and
nothing
else
that
these
prizes
are
to
be
imputed
to
he
also
talked
with
me
about
coventry
dealing
with
him
in
sending
sir
pen
away
before
him
which
was
not
fair
nor
kind
but
that
he
hath
mastered
and
cajoled
sir
pen
that
he
hath
been
able
to
do
nothing
in
the
fleet
but
been
obedient
to
him
but
withal
tells
me
he
is
a
man
that
is
but
of
very
mean
parts
and
a
fellow
not
to
be
lived
with
so
false
and
base
he
is
which
i
know
well
enough
to
be
true
and
did
as
i
had
formerly
done
give
my
lord
my
knowledge
of
him
by
and
by
was
called
a
council
of
warr
on
board
when
comes
sir
pen
there
and
sir
christopher
mings
the
son
of
a
shoemaker
bred
to
the
sea
service
and
rose
to
the
rank
of
an
admiral
he
was
killed
in
the
naval
action
with
the
dutch
june
sir
edward
spragg
sir
jos
jordan
distinguished
himself
as
an
admiral
in
the
battle
of
soleby
and
on
other
occasions
sir
thomas
teddiman
and
sir
roger
cuttance
so
to
our
yacht
again
having
seen
many
of
my
friends
there
and
continued
till
we
come
into
chatham
river
to
lambeth
but
lord
what
a
sad
time
it
is
to
see
no
boats
upon
the
river
and
grass
grows
all
up
and
down
white
hall
court
and
nobody
but
poor
wretches
in
the
streets
and
which
is
worst
of
all
the
duke
showed
us
the
number
of
the
plague
this
week
brought
in
the
last
night
from
the
lord
mayor
that
it
is
encreased
about
more
than
the
last
which
is
quite
contrary
to
our
hopes
and
expectations
from
the
coldness
of
the
late
season
for
the
whole
general
number
is
and
of
them
the
plague
which
is
more
in
the
whole
by
above
than
the
biggest
bill
yet
which
is
very
grievous
to
us
all
to
nonsuch
to
the
exchequer
by
appointment
and
walked
up
and
down
the
house
and
park
and
a
fine
place
it
hath
heretofore
been
and
a
fine
prospect
about
the
house
a
great
walk
of
an
elme
and
a
walnutt
set
one
after
another
in
order
and
all
the
house
on
the
outside
filled
with
figures
of
stories
and
good
painting
of
rubens
or
holben
doing
and
one
great
thing
is
that
most
of
the
house
is
covered
i
mean
the
post
and
quarters
in
the
walls
with
lead
and
gilded
i
walked
also
into
the
ruined
garden
at
blackwell
here
is
observable
what
johnson
tells
us
that
in
digging
the
late
docke
they
did
feet
under
ground
find
perfect
trees
with
earth
nut
trees
with
the
branches
and
the
very
nuts
upon
them
some
of
whose
nuts
he
showed
us
their
shells
black
with
age
and
their
kernell
upon
opening
decayed
but
their
shell
perfectly
hard
as
ever
and
a
yew
tree
upon
which
the
very
ivy
was
taken
up
whole
about
it
which
upon
cutting
with
an
addes
we
found
to
be
rather
harder
than
the
living
tree
usually
is
among
other
discourse
concerning
long
life
sir
minnes
saying
that
his
father
was
alive
in
edward
the
vth
time
my
lord
sandwich
did
tell
us
how
few
there
have
been
of
his
family
since
king
harry
the
viiith
that
is
to
say
the
then
chiefe
justice
sir
edward
montagu
ob
and
his
son
and
the
lord
montagu
who
was
father
i
think
this
should
be
brother
as
edward
first
lord
montagu
and
sir
sidney
montagu
were
both
sons
of
the
second
sir
edward
montagu
to
sir
sidney
master
of
the
requests
to
charles
who
was
his
father
and
yet
what
is
more
wonderfull
he
did
assure
us
from
the
mouth
of
my
lord
montagu
himself
that
in
king
james
time
when
he
had
a
mind
to
get
the
king
to
cut
off
the
entayle
of
some
land
which
was
given
in
harry
the
viiith
time
to
the
family
with
the
remainder
in
the
crowne
he
did
answer
the
king
in
showing
how
unlikely
it
was
that
ever
it
could
revert
to
the
crown
but
that
it
would
be
a
present
convenience
to
him
and
did
show
that
at
that
time
there
were
persons
derived
from
the
very
body
of
the
chiefe
justice
it
seems
the
number
of
daughters
in
the
family
had
been
very
great
and
they
too
had
most
of
them
many
children
and
grandchildren
and
this
he
tells
as
a
most
known
and
certain
truth
found
ourselves
come
to
the
fleet
and
so
aboard
the
prince
and
there
after
a
good
while
in
discourse
we
did
agree
a
bargain
of
for
my
lord
sandwich
for
silk
cinnamon
nutmegs
and
indigo
and
i
was
near
signing
to
an
undertaking
for
the
payment
of
the
whole
sum
but
i
did
by
chance
escape
it
having
since
upon
second
thoughts
great
cause
to
be
glad
of
it
reflecting
upon
the
craft
and
not
good
condition
it
may
be
of
captain
cocke
to
captain
cocke
and
he
not
yet
come
from
town
to
evelyn
where
much
company
and
thence
in
his
coach
with
him
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
by
lambeth
who
was
in
a
mighty
pleasant
humour
and
tells
us
that
the
dutch
do
stay
abroad
and
our
fleet
must
go
out
again
or
be
ready
to
do
so
here
we
got
several
things
ordered
as
we
desired
for
the
relief
of
the
prisoners
and
sick
and
wounded
men
here
i
saw
this
week
bill
of
mortality
wherein
blessed
be
god
there
is
above
decrease
being
the
first
considerable
decrease
we
have
had
most
excellent
discourse
with
evelyn
touching
all
manner
of
learning
wherein
i
find
him
a
very
fine
gentleman
and
particularly
of
paynting
in
which
he
tells
me
the
beautifull
middleton
is
rare
and
his
own
wife
do
brave
things
sir
martin
noell
he
had
been
a
farmer
of
the
excise
and
customs
before
the
restoration
the
messenger
described
in
hudibras
part
iii
canto
ii
as
disturbing
the
cabal
with
the
account
of
the
mobs
burning
rumps
is
said
to
have
keen
intended
for
sir
martin
noell
is
this
day
dead
of
the
plague
in
london
october
embarked
on
board
the
bezan
and
come
to
the
fleet
about
two
of
the
clock
my
lord
received
us
mighty
kindly
and
did
discourse
to
us
of
the
dutch
fleet
being
abroad
five
of
them
still
having
sailed
all
night
and
i
do
wonder
how
they
in
the
dark
could
find
the
way
we
got
by
morning
to
gillingham
and
thence
all
walked
to
chatham
and
there
with
commissioner
pett
viewed
the
yard
and
among
other
things
a
team
of
four
horses
come
close
by
us
he
being
with
me
drawing
a
piece
of
timber
that
i
am
confident
one
man
could
easily
have
carried
upon
his
back
i
made
the
horses
be
taken
away
and
a
man
or
two
to
take
the
timber
away
with
their
hands
sir
batten
is
gone
this
day
to
meet
to
adjourne
the
parliament
to
oxford
this
night
i
hear
that
of
our
two
watermen
that
used
to
carry
our
letters
and
were
well
on
saturday
last
one
is
dead
and
the
other
dying
sick
of
the
plague
the
plague
though
decreasing
elsewhere
yet
being
greater
about
the
tower
and
thereabouts
this
night
comes
sir
george
smith
to
see
me
at
the
office
and
tells
me
how
the
plague
is
decreased
this
week
for
which
god
be
praised
but
that
it
encreases
at
our
end
of
the
town
still
read
a
book
of
evelyn
translating
and
sending
me
as
a
present
about
directions
for
gathering
a
library
but
the
book
is
above
my
reach
but
his
epistle
to
my
lord
chancellor
is
a
very
fine
piece
then
to
evelyn
to
discourse
of
our
confounded
business
of
prisoners
and
sick
and
wounded
seamen
wherein
he
and
we
are
so
much
put
out
of
order
and
here
he
showed
me
his
gardens
which
are
for
variety
of
evergreens
and
hedge
of
holly
the
finest
things
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
thence
in
his
coach
to
greenwich
and
there
to
my
office
all
the
way
having
fine
discourse
of
trees
and
the
nature
of
vegetables
did
business
though
not
much
at
the
office
because
of
the
horrible
crowd
and
lamentable
moan
of
the
poor
seamen
that
lie
starving
in
the
streets
for
lack
of
money
which
do
trouble
and
perplex
me
to
the
heart
and
more
at
noon
when
we
were
to
go
through
them
for
then
above
a
whole
hundred
of
them
followed
us
some
cursing
some
swearing
and
some
praying
to
us
at
night
come
two
waggons
from
rochester
with
more
goods
from
captain
cocke
and
in
housing
them
come
two
of
the
and
did
seize
them
but
i
showed
them
my
transire
however
after
some
angry
words
we
locked
them
up
and
sealed
up
the
key
and
did
give
it
to
the
constable
to
keep
till
monday
and
so
parted
but
lord
to
think
how
the
poor
constable
come
to
me
in
the
dark
going
home
sir
says
he
i
have
the
key
and
if
you
would
have
me
do
any
service
for
you
send
for
me
betimes
morrow
morning
and
i
will
do
what
you
would
have
me
whether
the
fellow
do
this
out
of
kindness
or
knavery
i
can
not
tell
but
it
is
pretty
to
observe
talking
with
him
in
the
high
way
come
close
by
the
bearers
with
a
dead
corpse
of
the
plague
but
lord
to
see
what
custom
is
that
i
am
come
almost
to
think
nothing
of
it
to
the
office
where
ended
my
business
with
the
captains
and
i
think
of
ships
we
shall
make
shift
to
get
out
seven
god
help
us
men
being
sick
or
provisions
lacking
called
upon
by
sir
john
shaw
to
whom
i
did
give
a
civil
answer
about
our
prize
goods
that
all
his
dues
as
one
of
the
farmers
of
the
customes
are
paid
and
showed
him
our
transire
with
which
he
was
satisfied
and
parted
we
met
seamour
one
of
the
commissioners
for
prizes
and
a
and
he
was
mighty
high
and
had
now
seized
our
goods
on
their
behalf
and
he
mighty
imperiously
would
have
all
forfeited
but
i
could
not
but
think
it
odd
that
a
in
a
serious
discourse
before
such
persons
as
we
and
my
lord
brouncker
and
sir
john
minnes
should
quote
hudibras
as
being
the
book
i
doubt
he
hath
read
most
good
news
this
week
that
there
are
about
less
dead
of
the
plague
than
the
last
sir
jer
smith
a
distinguished
naval
officer
made
a
commissioner
of
the
navy
vice
sir
pen
to
see
me
in
his
way
to
court
and
a
good
man
he
is
and
one
that
i
must
keep
fair
with
my
heart
and
head
is
full
of
the
victualling
business
being
overjoyed
and
proud
at
my
success
in
my
proposal
about
it
it
being
read
before
the
king
duke
and
the
caball
with
complete
applause
and
satisfaction
this
sir
carteret
and
sir
coventry
both
writ
me
my
own
proper
accounts
are
in
great
disorder
having
been
neglected
about
a
month
this
and
the
fear
of
the
sickness
and
providing
for
my
family
do
fill
my
head
very
full
besides
the
infinite
business
of
the
office
and
nobody
here
to
look
after
it
but
myself
the
parliament
it
seems
have
voted
the
king
at
per
month
tax
for
the
war
and
voted
to
assist
the
king
against
the
dutch
and
all
that
shall
adhere
to
them
and
thanks
to
be
given
him
for
his
care
of
the
duke
of
york
which
last
is
a
very
popular
vote
on
the
duke
behalf
the
taxes
of
the
last
assessment
which
should
have
been
in
good
part
gathered
are
not
yet
laid
and
that
even
in
part
of
the
city
of
london
and
the
comes
almost
to
nothing
nor
any
thing
else
looked
after
i
walked
to
the
tower
but
lord
how
empty
the
streets
are
and
melancholy
so
many
poor
sick
people
in
the
streets
full
of
sores
and
so
many
sad
stories
overheard
as
i
walk
every
body
talking
of
this
dead
and
that
man
sick
and
so
many
in
this
place
and
so
many
in
that
and
they
tell
me
that
in
westminster
there
is
never
a
physician
and
but
one
apothecary
left
all
being
dead
but
that
there
are
great
hopes
of
a
great
decrease
this
week
god
send
it
at
the
tower
found
my
lord
duke
and
duchesse
at
dinner
so
i
sat
down
and
much
good
cheer
the
lieutenant
and
his
lady
and
several
officers
with
the
duke
but
lord
to
hear
the
silly
talk
was
there
would
make
one
mad
the
duke
having
none
almost
but
fools
about
him
i
have
received
letters
from
my
lord
sandwich
today
speaking
very
high
about
the
prize
goods
that
he
would
have
us
to
fear
nobody
but
be
very
confident
in
what
we
have
done
and
not
to
confess
any
fault
or
doubt
of
what
he
hath
done
for
the
king
hath
allowed
it
and
do
now
confirm
it
and
send
orders
as
he
says
for
nothing
to
be
disturbed
that
his
lordshipp
hath
ordered
therein
as
to
the
division
of
the
goods
to
the
fleet
which
do
comfort
us
much
talk
there
is
of
the
chancellor
speech
and
the
king
at
the
parliament
meeting
which
are
very
well
liked
and
that
we
shall
certainly
by
their
speeches
fall
out
with
france
at
this
time
together
with
the
dutch
which
will
find
us
work
sir
christopher
mings
and
i
together
by
water
to
the
tower
and
i
find
him
a
very
witty
fellow
and
mighty
free
to
tell
his
parentage
being
a
shoemaker
son
i
to
the
where
i
hear
how
the
french
have
taken
two
and
sunk
one
of
our
in
the
straights
and
carried
the
ships
to
toulon
so
that
there
is
no
expectation
but
we
must
fall
out
with
them
the
pretty
full
and
the
town
begins
to
be
lively
again
though
the
streets
very
empty
and
most
shops
shut
the
duke
of
albemarle
proposed
to
me
from
coventry
that
i
should
be
of
the
victualling
business
which
i
accepted
but
indeed
the
terms
in
which
coventry
proposes
it
for
me
are
the
most
obliging
that
ever
i
could
expect
from
any
man
and
more
he
saying
that
i
am
the
fittest
man
in
england
and
that
he
is
sure
if
i
will
undertake
i
will
perform
it
and
that
it
will
be
also
a
very
desirable
thing
that
i
might
have
this
encouragement
my
encouragement
in
the
navy
alone
being
in
no
wise
proportionable
to
my
pains
or
deserts
this
added
to
the
letter
i
had
three
days
since
from
southerne
secretary
to
sir
w
coventry
signifying
that
the
duke
of
york
had
in
his
master
absence
opened
my
letters
and
commanded
him
to
tell
me
that
he
did
approve
of
my
being
the
do
make
me
joyful
beyond
myself
that
i
can
not
express
it
to
see
that
as
i
do
take
pains
so
god
blesses
me
and
hath
sent
me
masters
that
do
observe
that
i
take
pains
the
parliament
hath
given
the
duke
of
york
to
be
paid
him
after
is
gathered
upon
the
tax
which
they
have
now
given
the
king
he
tells
me
that
the
dutch
have
lately
launched
sixteen
new
ships
all
which
is
great
news
the
king
and
court
they
say
have
now
finally
resolved
to
spend
nothing
upon
clothes
but
what
is
of
the
growth
of
england
which
if
observed
will
be
very
pleasing
to
the
people
and
very
good
for
them
in
the
street
did
overtake
and
almost
run
upon
two
women
crying
and
carrying
a
man
coffin
between
them
i
suppose
the
husband
of
one
of
them
which
methinks
is
a
sad
thing
meeting
yesterday
the
searchers
with
their
rods
in
their
hands
coming
from
captain
cocke
house
i
did
overhear
them
say
that
his
black
did
not
die
of
the
plague
about
nine
at
night
i
come
home
and
anon
comes
coleman
probably
the
person
mentioned
in
the
following
extract
from
malone
account
of
the
english
stage
in
or
in
imitation
of
foreign
theatres
women
were
first
introduced
on
the
scene
in
indeed
coleman
wife
to
edward
coleman
represented
ianthe
in
the
first
part
of
the
siege
of
rhodes
but
the
little
she
had
to
say
was
spoken
in
recitative
and
her
husband
and
she
sung
very
finely
though
her
voice
is
decayed
as
to
strength
but
mighty
sweet
though
soft
and
a
pleasant
jolly
woman
and
in
mighty
good
humour
she
sung
part
of
the
opera
though
she
would
not
own
she
did
get
any
of
it
without
book
in
order
to
the
stage
thus
we
end
the
month
the
whole
number
of
deaths
being
and
of
them
of
the
plague
want
of
money
in
the
navy
puts
every
thing
out
of
order
men
grow
mutinous
and
nobody
here
to
mind
the
business
of
the
navy
but
myself
i
in
great
hopes
of
my
place
of
of
the
victualling
which
will
bring
me
per
annum
november
my
lord
brouncker
with
us
to
lodgings
and
sir
batten
sir
edmund
pooly
for
bury
edmunds
and
in
the
list
of
proposed
knights
of
the
royal
oak
for
suffolk
and
others
and
there
it
being
my
lord
had
every
one
a
green
riband
tied
in
our
hats
very
foolishly
and
methinks
mighty
disgracefully
for
my
lord
to
have
his
folly
so
open
to
all
the
world
with
this
woman
by
water
to
deptford
and
there
made
a
visit
to
evelyn
who
among
other
things
showed
me
most
excellent
painting
in
little
in
distemper
indian
incke
water
colours
graveing
and
above
all
the
whole
secret
of
and
the
manner
of
it
which
is
very
pretty
and
good
things
done
with
it
he
read
to
me
very
much
also
of
his
discourse
he
hath
been
many
years
and
now
is
about
about
gardenage
which
will
be
a
most
noble
and
pleasant
piece
he
read
me
part
of
a
play
or
two
of
his
making
very
good
but
not
as
he
conceits
them
i
think
to
be
he
showed
me
his
hortus
hyemalis
leaves
laid
up
in
a
book
of
several
plants
kept
dry
which
preserve
colour
however
and
look
very
finely
better
than
an
herball
in
fine
a
most
excellent
person
he
is
and
must
be
allowed
a
little
for
a
little
conceitedness
but
he
may
well
be
so
being
a
man
so
much
above
others
he
read
me
though
with
too
much
gusto
some
little
poems
of
his
own
that
were
not
transcendant
yet
one
or
two
very
pretty
epigrams
among
others
of
a
lady
looking
in
at
a
grate
and
being
pecked
at
by
an
eagle
that
was
there
sir
carteret
and
i
did
walk
an
hour
in
the
garden
before
the
house
talking
of
my
lord
sandwich
business
what
enemies
he
hath
and
how
they
have
endeavoured
to
bespatter
him
and
particularly
about
his
leaving
of
ships
of
the
enemy
when
pen
would
have
gone
and
my
lord
called
him
back
again
which
is
most
false
however
he
says
it
was
purposed
by
some
in
the
house
of
commons
at
the
same
time
when
they
voted
a
present
to
the
duke
of
york
to
have
voted
to
the
prince
and
to
my
lord
of
sandwich
but
nothing
come
of
it
but
for
all
this
the
king
is
most
firme
to
my
lord
and
so
is
my
lord
chancellor
and
my
lord
arlington
the
prince
in
appearance
kind
the
duke
of
york
silent
says
no
hurt
but
admits
others
to
say
it
in
his
hearing
sir
pen
the
falsest
rascal
that
ever
was
in
the
world
and
that
this
afternoon
the
duke
of
albemarle
did
tell
him
that
pen
was
a
very
cowardly
rogue
and
one
that
hath
brought
all
these
rogueish
fanatick
captains
into
the
fleet
and
swears
he
should
never
go
out
with
the
fleet
again
that
sir
coventry
is
most
kind
to
pen
still
and
says
nothing
not
do
any
thing
openly
to
the
prejudice
of
my
lord
he
agrees
with
me
that
it
is
impossible
for
the
king
to
set
out
a
fleet
again
the
next
year
and
that
he
fears
all
will
come
to
ruine
there
being
no
money
in
prospect
but
these
prizes
which
will
bring
it
may
be
but
that
will
signify
nothing
in
the
world
for
it
the
bill
of
mortality
to
all
our
griefs
is
encreased
this
week
and
the
encrease
generally
through
the
whole
city
and
suburbs
which
makes
us
all
sad
captain
cocke
and
i
in
his
coach
through
a
sad
place
through
the
plague
people
sitting
sick
and
with
plaisters
about
them
in
the
street
begging
the
plague
blessed
be
god
is
decreased
making
the
whole
this
week
but
and
odd
for
which
the
lord
be
praised
to
eriffe
where
after
making
a
little
visit
to
madam
williams
she
did
give
me
information
of
how
having
bought
eight
bags
of
precious
stones
taken
from
about
the
dutch
admirall
neck
of
which
there
were
eight
dyamonds
which
cost
him
sterling
in
india
and
hoped
to
have
made
here
for
them
and
that
this
is
told
by
one
that
sold
him
one
of
the
bags
which
hath
nothing
but
rubys
in
it
which
he
had
for
and
that
it
will
be
proved
he
hath
made
of
one
stone
that
he
bought
this
she
desired
and
i
resolved
i
would
give
my
lord
sandwich
notice
of
so
i
on
board
my
lord
brouncker
and
there
he
and
sir
edmund
pooly
carried
me
down
into
the
hold
of
the
india
shipp
and
there
did
show
me
the
greatest
wealth
lie
in
confusion
that
a
man
can
see
in
the
world
pepper
scattered
through
every
chink
you
trod
upon
it
and
in
cloves
and
nutmegs
i
walked
above
the
knees
whole
rooms
full
and
silk
in
bales
and
boxes
of
one
of
which
i
saw
opened
having
seen
this
which
was
as
noble
a
sight
as
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
i
away
on
board
the
other
ship
in
despair
to
get
the
of
the
gentlemen
there
to
carry
me
to
the
fleet
they
were
ashburnham
john
ashburnham
a
groom
of
the
bedchamber
to
charles
whom
he
attended
during
the
whole
of
the
rebellion
and
afterwards
filled
the
same
post
under
charles
ii
he
was
in
for
sussex
and
ob
and
colonell
wyndham
but
pleading
the
king
business
they
did
presently
agree
i
should
have
it
so
i
presently
on
board
and
got
under
sail
and
had
a
good
bedd
by
the
shift
of
wyndham
and
so
sailed
all
night
and
got
down
to
quinbrough
water
where
all
the
great
ships
are
now
come
and
there
on
board
my
lord
and
was
soon
received
with
great
content
and
after
some
little
discourse
he
and
i
on
board
sir
pen
and
there
held
a
council
of
warr
about
many
wants
of
the
fleet
and
so
followed
my
lord
sandwich
who
was
gone
a
little
before
me
on
board
the
royall
james
and
there
spent
an
hour
my
lord
playing
upon
the
gittarr
which
he
now
commends
above
all
musique
in
the
world
as
an
infinite
secret
my
lord
tells
me
the
factions
are
high
between
the
king
and
the
duke
and
all
the
court
are
in
an
uproar
with
their
loose
amours
the
duke
of
york
being
in
love
desperately
with
stewart
nay
that
the
duchesse
herself
is
fallen
in
love
with
her
new
master
of
the
horse
one
harry
sidney
younger
son
of
robert
earl
of
leicester
created
earl
of
romney
he
was
lord
lieutenant
of
ireland
master
of
the
ordnance
and
warden
of
the
cinque
ports
in
the
reign
of
king
william
ob
unmarried
and
another
harry
savill
henry
saville
some
time
one
of
the
grooms
of
the
bedchamber
to
the
duke
of
york
so
that
god
knows
what
will
be
the
end
of
it
and
that
the
duke
is
not
so
obsequious
as
he
need
to
be
but
very
high
of
late
and
would
be
glad
to
be
in
the
head
of
an
army
as
generall
and
that
it
is
said
that
he
do
propose
to
go
and
command
under
the
king
of
spayne
in
flanders
that
his
amours
to
stewart
are
told
the
king
so
that
all
is
like
to
be
nought
among
them
i
was
very
glad
to
hear
that
the
plague
is
come
very
low
that
is
the
whole
under
and
the
plague
and
odd
and
great
hopes
of
a
further
decrease
because
of
this
day
being
a
very
exceeding
hard
frost
and
continues
freezing
this
day
the
first
of
the
oxford
gazettes
come
out
which
is
very
pretty
full
of
news
and
no
folly
in
it
wrote
by
williamson
it
pleased
me
to
have
it
demonstrated
that
a
purser
without
professed
cheating
is
a
professed
loser
twice
as
much
as
he
gets
captn
cuttance
tells
me
how
how
is
laid
by
the
heels
and
confined
to
the
royall
katharin
and
his
things
all
seized
to
the
where
very
busy
with
several
people
and
mightily
glad
to
see
the
so
full
and
hopes
of
another
abatement
still
the
next
week
visited
evelyn
where
most
excellent
discourse
with
him
among
other
things
he
showed
me
a
lieger
of
a
treasurer
of
the
navy
his
great
grandfather
just
years
old
which
i
seemed
mighty
fond
of
and
he
did
present
me
with
it
which
i
take
as
a
great
rarity
and
he
hopes
to
find
me
more
older
than
it
he
also
showed
us
several
letters
of
the
old
lord
of
leicester
there
are
some
letters
and
papers
answering
to
this
description
in
the
pepysian
library
and
amongst
them
an
account
of
the
coroner
inquest
held
upon
the
countess
of
leicester
at
cumnor
in
queen
elizabeth
time
under
the
very
of
queen
elizabeth
and
queen
mary
queen
of
scotts
and
others
very
venerable
names
but
lord
how
poorly
methinks
they
wrote
in
those
days
and
in
what
plain
uncut
paper
with
sir
carteret
who
tells
me
that
my
lord
hath
received
still
worse
and
worse
usage
from
some
base
people
about
the
court
but
the
king
is
very
kind
and
the
duke
do
not
appear
the
contrary
and
my
lord
chancellor
swore
to
him
by
i
will
not
forsake
my
lord
of
sandwich
i
into
london
it
being
dark
night
by
a
hackny
coach
the
first
i
have
durst
to
go
in
many
a
day
and
with
great
pain
now
for
fear
but
it
being
unsafe
to
go
by
water
in
the
dark
and
frosty
cold
and
unable
being
weary
with
my
morning
walk
to
go
on
foot
this
was
my
only
way
few
people
yet
in
the
streets
nor
shops
open
here
and
there
twenty
in
a
place
almost
though
not
above
five
or
six
at
night
great
joy
we
have
this
week
in
the
weekly
bill
it
being
come
to
in
all
and
but
of
the
plague
so
that
we
are
encouraged
to
get
to
london
soon
as
we
can
and
my
father
writes
as
great
news
of
joy
to
them
that
he
saw
york
waggon
go
again
this
week
to
london
and
full
of
passengers
and
tells
me
that
my
aunt
bell
hath
been
dead
of
the
plague
these
seven
weeks
december
to
captn
cocke
and
there
dined
with
him
and
colonell
wyndham
a
worthy
gentleman
whose
wife
was
nurse
to
the
present
king
and
one
that
while
she
lived
governed
him
and
every
thing
else
as
cocke
says
as
a
minister
of
state
the
old
king
putting
mighty
weight
and
trust
upon
her
they
talked
much
of
matters
of
state
and
persons
and
particularly
how
my
lord
barkeley
hath
all
along
been
a
fortunate
though
a
passionate
and
but
weak
man
as
to
policy
but
as
a
kinsman
brought
in
and
promoted
by
my
lord
of
alban
and
one
that
is
the
greatest
vapourer
in
the
world
this
colonell
wyndham
says
and
to
whom
only
with
jacke
ashburne
this
should
be
ashburnham
and
colonel
legg
william
legge
groom
of
the
bedchamber
to
charles
and
father
to
the
first
lord
dartmouth
he
was
for
southampton
ob
the
king
removal
to
the
isle
of
wight
from
hampton
court
was
communicated
and
though
betrayed
by
their
knavery
or
at
best
by
their
ignorance
insomuch
that
they
have
all
solemnly
charged
one
another
with
their
failures
therein
and
have
been
at
publickly
about
it
yet
now
none
greater
friends
in
the
world
upon
the
colvill
tells
me
from
oxford
that
the
king
in
person
hath
justified
my
lord
sandwich
to
the
highest
degree
and
is
right
in
his
favour
to
the
uttermost
up
betimes
it
being
and
by
water
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
who
come
to
town
from
oxford
last
night
he
is
mighty
brisk
and
very
kind
to
me
and
asks
my
advice
principally
in
every
thing
he
surprises
me
with
the
news
that
my
lord
sandwich
goes
embassador
to
spayne
speedily
though
i
know
not
whence
this
arises
yet
i
am
heartily
glad
of
it
the
king
hath
done
my
lord
sandwich
all
the
right
imaginable
by
showing
him
his
countenance
before
all
the
world
on
every
occasion
to
remove
thoughts
of
discontent
and
he
is
to
go
embassador
and
the
duke
of
york
is
made
generall
of
all
forces
by
land
and
sea
and
the
duke
of
albemarle
to
white
hall
where
we
found
sir
carteret
with
the
duke
and
also
sir
downing
whom
i
had
not
seen
in
many
years
before
he
greeted
me
very
kindly
and
i
him
though
methinks
i
am
touched
that
it
should
be
said
that
he
was
my
master
heretofore
as
doubtless
he
will
my
lord
brouncker
and
i
dined
with
the
duke
of
albemarle
at
table
the
duchesse
a
very
woman
complaining
of
her
lord
going
to
sea
the
next
year
said
these
cursed
words
if
my
lord
had
been
a
coward
he
had
gone
to
sea
no
more
it
may
be
then
he
might
have
been
excused
and
made
an
embassador
meaning
my
lord
sandwich
this
made
me
mad
and
i
believed
she
perceived
my
countenance
change
and
blushed
herself
very
much
i
was
in
hopes
others
had
not
minded
it
but
my
lord
brouncker
after
we
were
come
away
took
notice
of
the
words
to
me
with
displeasure
that
i
may
remember
it
the
more
particularly
i
thought
fit
to
insert
this
memorandum
of
temple
discourse
this
night
with
me
which
i
took
in
writing
from
his
mouth
before
the
harp
and
crosse
money
was
cried
down
he
and
his
fellow
goldsmiths
did
make
some
particular
trials
what
proportion
that
money
bore
to
the
old
king
money
and
they
found
that
generally
it
come
to
one
with
another
about
in
every
of
this
money
there
was
upon
the
calling
of
it
in
at
least
brought
into
the
tower
and
from
thence
he
computes
that
the
whole
money
of
england
must
be
full
but
for
all
this
believes
that
there
is
about
he
supposing
that
about
the
coming
in
when
he
begun
to
observe
the
quantity
of
the
new
money
people
begun
to
be
fearful
of
this
money
being
cried
down
and
so
picked
it
out
and
set
it
as
fast
as
they
could
to
be
rid
of
it
and
he
thinks
the
rather
because
if
there
were
but
the
king
having
every
year
would
have
the
whole
money
of
the
kingdom
in
his
hands
in
eight
years
he
tells
me
about
sterling
was
coined
out
of
the
french
money
the
proceeds
of
dunkirke
so
that
with
what
was
coined
of
the
cross
money
there
is
new
coined
about
besides
the
gold
which
is
guessed
at
he
tells
me
that
though
the
king
did
deposit
the
french
money
in
pawn
all
the
while
for
the
he
was
forced
to
borrow
thereupon
till
the
tools
could
be
made
for
the
new
minting
in
the
present
form
yet
the
interest
he
paid
for
that
time
come
to
viner
having
to
his
knowledge
for
the
use
of
of
it
away
to
the
and
there
hear
the
ill
news
to
my
great
and
all
our
great
trouble
that
the
plague
is
encreased
again
this
week
notwithstanding
there
hath
been
a
long
day
or
two
great
frosts
but
we
hope
it
is
only
the
effects
of
the
late
close
warm
weather
and
if
the
frost
continue
the
next
week
may
fall
again
but
the
towne
do
thicken
so
much
with
people
that
it
is
much
if
the
plague
do
not
grow
again
upon
us
met
with
sir
james
bunch
probably
james
bunce
an
alderman
of
london
this
is
the
time
for
you
says
he
that
were
for
oliver
heretofore
you
are
full
of
employment
and
we
poor
cavaliers
sit
still
and
can
get
nothing
which
was
a
pretty
reproach
i
thought
but
answered
nothing
to
it
for
fear
of
making
it
worse
i
to
my
lord
brouncker
and
there
spent
the
evening
by
my
desire
in
seeing
his
lordship
open
to
pieces
and
make
up
again
his
watch
thereby
being
taught
what
i
never
knew
before
and
it
is
a
thing
very
well
worth
my
having
seen
and
am
mightily
pleased
and
satisfied
with
it
christmas
day
to
church
in
the
morning
and
there
saw
a
wedding
in
the
church
which
i
have
not
seen
many
a
day
and
the
young
people
so
merry
one
with
another
and
strange
to
see
what
delight
we
married
people
have
to
see
these
poor
fools
decoyed
into
our
condition
every
man
and
woman
gazing
and
smiling
at
them
saw
some
fine
writing
work
and
flourishing
of
hore
with
one
that
i
knew
long
ago
an
acquaintance
of
tomson
at
westminster
that
is
this
man
clerk
it
is
the
story
of
the
several
archbishops
of
canterbury
engrossed
in
vellum
to
hang
up
in
canterbury
cathedrall
in
tables
in
lieu
of
the
old
ones
which
are
almost
worn
out
all
the
afternoon
to
my
accounts
and
there
find
myself
to
my
great
joy
a
great
deal
worth
above
for
which
the
lord
be
praised
and
is
principally
occasioned
by
my
getting
of
cocke
for
my
profit
in
his
bargains
of
prize
goods
and
from
gauden
making
me
a
present
of
more
when
i
paid
him
for
tangier
thus
ends
this
year
to
my
great
joy
in
this
manner
i
have
raised
my
estate
from
in
this
year
to
i
have
got
myself
greater
interest
i
think
by
my
diligence
and
my
imployments
encreased
by
that
of
treasurer
for
tangier
and
surveyor
of
the
victualls
it
is
true
we
have
gone
through
great
melancholy
because
of
the
great
plague
and
i
put
to
great
charges
by
it
by
keeping
my
family
long
at
woolwich
and
myself
and
another
part
of
my
family
my
clerks
at
my
charge
at
greenwich
and
a
maid
at
london
but
i
hope
the
king
will
give
us
some
satisfaction
for
that
but
now
the
plague
is
abated
almost
to
nothing
and
i
intending
to
get
to
london
as
fast
as
i
can
the
dutch
war
goes
on
very
ill
by
reason
of
lack
of
money
having
none
to
hope
for
all
being
put
into
disorder
by
a
new
act
that
is
made
as
an
experiment
to
bring
credit
to
the
exchequer
for
goods
and
money
to
be
advanced
upon
the
credit
of
that
act
the
great
evil
of
this
year
and
the
only
one
indeed
is
the
fall
of
my
lord
of
sandwich
whose
mistake
about
the
prizes
hath
undone
him
i
believe
as
to
interest
at
court
though
sent
for
a
little
palliating
it
embassador
into
spayne
which
he
is
now
fitting
himself
for
but
the
duke
of
albemarle
goes
with
the
prince
to
sea
this
next
year
and
my
lord
is
very
meanly
spoken
of
and
indeed
his
miscarriage
about
the
prize
goods
is
not
to
be
excused
to
suffer
a
company
of
rogues
to
go
away
with
ten
times
as
much
as
himself
and
the
blame
of
all
to
be
deservedly
laid
upon
him
my
whole
family
hath
been
well
all
the
while
and
all
my
friends
i
know
of
saving
my
aunt
bell
who
is
dead
and
some
children
of
my
cosen
sarah
of
the
plague
but
many
of
such
as
i
know
very
well
dead
yet
to
our
great
joy
the
town
fills
apace
and
shops
begin
to
be
open
again
pray
god
continue
the
plague
decrease
for
that
keeps
the
court
away
from
the
place
of
business
and
so
all
goes
to
rack
as
to
publick
matters
they
at
this
distance
not
thinking
of
it
january
i
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
back
again
and
at
the
duke
with
great
joy
i
received
the
good
news
of
the
decrease
of
the
plague
this
week
to
and
but
in
all
which
is
the
least
bill
hath
been
known
these
twenty
years
in
the
city
through
the
want
of
people
in
london
is
it
that
must
make
it
so
low
below
the
ordinary
number
for
bills
i
with
my
lord
brouncker
and
williams
by
coach
with
four
horses
to
london
to
my
lord
house
in
but
lord
what
staring
to
see
a
nobleman
coach
come
to
town
and
porters
every
where
bow
to
us
and
such
begging
of
beggars
and
delightful
it
is
to
see
the
town
full
of
people
again
and
shops
begin
to
open
though
in
many
places
seven
or
eight
together
and
more
all
shut
but
yet
the
town
is
full
compared
with
what
it
used
to
be
i
mean
the
city
end
for
and
westminster
are
yet
very
empty
of
people
no
court
nor
gentry
being
there
reading
a
discourse
about
the
river
of
thames
the
reason
of
its
being
choked
up
in
several
places
with
shelfes
which
is
plain
is
by
the
encroachments
made
upon
the
river
and
running
out
of
causeways
into
the
river
at
every
which
was
not
heretofore
when
westminster
hall
and
white
hall
were
built
and
redriffe
church
which
now
are
sometimes
overflown
with
water
the
town
talks
of
my
lord
craven
being
to
come
into
sir
carteret
place
but
sure
it
can
not
be
true
but
i
do
fear
those
two
families
his
and
my
lord
sandwich
are
quite
broken
and
i
must
now
stand
upon
my
own
legs
pierce
tells
me
how
great
a
difference
hath
been
between
the
duke
and
duchesse
he
suspecting
her
to
be
naught
with
sidney
but
some
way
or
other
the
matter
is
made
up
but
he
was
banished
the
court
and
the
duke
for
many
days
did
not
speak
to
the
duchesse
at
all
he
tells
me
that
my
lord
sandwich
is
lost
there
at
court
though
the
king
is
particularly
his
friend
but
people
do
speak
every
where
slightly
of
him
which
is
a
sad
story
to
me
but
i
hope
it
may
be
better
again
and
that
sir
carteret
is
neglected
and
hath
great
enemies
at
work
against
him
that
matters
must
needs
go
bad
while
all
the
town
and
every
boy
in
the
street
openly
cries
the
king
can
not
go
away
till
my
lady
castlemaine
be
ready
to
come
along
with
him
she
being
lately
put
to
bed
but
that
he
visits
her
and
stewart
every
morning
before
he
eats
his
breakfast
the
plague
is
encreased
this
week
from
seventy
to
nine
we
have
also
great
fear
of
our
hambrough
fleet
of
their
meeting
with
the
dutch
as
also
have
certain
news
that
by
storms
sir
jer
smith
fleet
is
scattered
and
three
of
them
come
without
masts
back
to
plymouth
home
with
his
lordship
to
williams
in
garden
to
dinner
the
first
time
i
ever
was
there
and
there
met
captain
cocke
and
pretty
merry
though
not
perfectly
so
because
of
the
fear
that
there
is
of
a
great
encrease
again
of
the
plague
this
week
and
again
my
lord
brouncker
do
tell
us
that
he
hath
it
from
sir
john
baber
physician
in
ordinary
to
the
king
who
is
related
to
my
lord
craven
that
my
lord
craven
do
look
after
sir
carteret
place
and
do
reckon
himself
sure
of
it
mightily
troubled
at
the
news
of
the
plague
being
encreased
and
was
much
the
saddest
news
that
the
plague
hath
brought
me
from
the
beginning
of
it
because
of
the
lateness
of
the
year
and
the
fear
we
may
with
reason
have
of
its
continuing
with
us
the
next
summer
the
total
being
now
and
the
plague
i
rode
to
dagenhams
in
the
dark
it
was
my
lord
desire
that
i
should
come
and
chiefly
to
discourse
with
me
of
my
lord
sandwich
matters
and
therein
to
persuade
what
i
had
done
already
that
my
lord
should
sue
out
a
pardon
for
his
business
of
the
prizes
as
also
for
bergen
and
all
he
hath
done
this
year
past
before
he
begins
his
embassy
to
spain
for
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
parliament
will
fly
out
against
him
and
particular
men
the
next
session
he
is
glad
also
that
my
lord
is
clear
of
his
though
sorry
as
i
am
only
in
the
manner
of
its
bringing
about
my
wife
and
i
anon
and
mercer
by
coach
to
pierce
where
mighty
merry
and
sing
and
dance
with
great
pleasure
and
i
danced
who
never
did
in
company
in
my
life
it
is
a
remarkable
thing
how
infinitely
naked
all
that
end
of
the
town
is
at
this
day
of
people
while
the
city
is
almost
as
full
again
of
people
as
ever
it
was
at
noon
my
lord
brouncker
did
come
but
left
the
keys
of
the
chests
we
should
open
at
sir
carteret
lodgings
of
my
lord
sandwich
wherein
how
supposed
jewells
are
so
we
could
not
according
to
my
lord
arlington
order
see
them
but
we
parted
resolving
to
meet
here
at
night
my
lord
brouncker
being
going
with
wilkins
hooke
robert
hooke
before
mentioned
professor
of
geometry
at
gresham
college
and
curator
of
the
experiments
to
the
royal
society
of
which
he
was
one
of
the
earliest
and
most
distinguished
members
ob
and
others
to
colonel
blunt
to
consider
again
of
the
business
of
chariots
and
to
try
their
new
invention
which
i
saw
here
my
lord
brouncker
ride
in
where
the
coachman
sits
astride
upon
a
pole
over
the
horse
but
do
not
touch
the
horse
which
is
a
pretty
odde
thing
but
it
seems
it
is
most
easy
for
the
horse
and
as
they
say
for
the
man
also
the
first
meeting
of
gresham
college
since
the
plague
goddard
did
fill
us
with
talk
in
defence
of
his
and
his
fellow
physicians
going
out
of
town
in
the
saying
that
their
particular
patients
were
most
gone
out
of
town
and
they
left
at
liberty
and
a
great
deal
more
but
what
among
other
fine
discourse
pleased
me
most
was
sir
ent
sir
george
ent
president
of
the
college
of
physicians
about
respiration
that
it
is
not
to
this
day
known
or
concluded
on
among
physicians
nor
to
be
done
either
how
the
action
is
managed
by
nature
or
for
what
use
it
is
good
news
beyond
all
expectation
of
the
decrease
of
the
plague
being
now
but
and
the
whole
but
so
home
with
comfort
to
bed
a
most
furious
storme
all
night
and
morning
my
lord
and
i
the
weather
being
a
little
fairer
by
water
to
deptford
to
sir
carteret
house
where
how
met
us
and
there
we
opened
the
chests
and
saw
the
poor
sorry
rubys
which
have
caused
all
this
ado
to
the
undoing
of
how
though
i
am
not
much
sorry
for
it
because
of
his
pride
and
ill
nature
about
of
these
very
small
stones
and
a
cod
of
muske
which
it
is
strange
i
was
not
able
to
smell
is
all
we
could
find
so
locked
them
up
again
and
my
lord
and
i
the
wind
being
again
very
furious
so
as
we
durst
not
go
by
water
walked
to
london
quite
round
the
bridge
no
boat
being
able
to
stirre
and
lord
what
a
dirty
walk
we
had
and
so
strong
the
wind
that
in
the
fields
we
many
times
could
not
carry
our
bodies
against
it
but
were
driven
backwards
we
went
through
horslydowne
where
i
never
was
since
a
boy
that
i
went
to
enquire
after
my
father
whom
we
did
give
over
for
lost
coming
from
holland
it
was
dangerous
to
walk
the
streets
the
bricks
and
tiles
falling
from
the
houses
that
the
whole
streets
were
covered
with
them
and
whole
chimneys
nay
whole
houses
in
two
or
three
places
blowed
down
but
above
all
the
pales
of
on
both
sides
were
blown
away
so
that
we
were
fain
to
stoop
very
low
for
fear
of
blowing
off
of
the
bridge
we
could
see
no
boats
in
the
thames
afloat
but
what
were
broke
loose
and
carried
through
the
bridge
it
being
ebbing
water
and
the
greatest
sight
of
all
was
among
other
parcels
of
ships
driven
here
and
there
in
clusters
together
one
was
quite
overset
and
lay
with
her
masts
all
along
in
the
water
and
keel
above
water
it
is
now
certain
that
the
king
of
france
hath
publickly
declared
war
against
us
and
god
knows
how
little
fit
we
are
for
it
took
coach
and
to
hampton
court
where
we
find
the
king
and
duke
and
lords
all
in
council
so
we
walked
up
and
down
there
being
none
of
the
ladies
come
and
so
much
the
more
business
i
hope
will
be
done
the
council
being
up
out
comes
the
king
and
i
kissed
his
hand
and
he
grasped
me
very
kindly
by
the
hand
the
duke
also
i
kissed
his
and
he
mighty
kind
and
sir
coventry
i
found
my
lord
sandwich
there
poor
man
i
see
with
it
melancholy
face
and
suffers
his
beard
to
grow
on
his
upper
lip
more
than
usual
i
took
him
a
little
aside
to
know
when
i
should
wait
on
him
and
where
he
told
me
and
that
it
would
be
best
to
meet
at
his
lodgings
without
being
seen
to
walk
together
which
i
liked
very
well
and
lord
to
see
in
what
difficulty
i
stand
that
i
dare
not
walk
with
sir
coventry
for
fear
my
lord
or
sir
carteret
should
see
me
nor
with
either
of
them
for
fear
sir
coventry
should
i
went
down
into
one
of
the
courts
and
there
met
the
king
and
duke
and
the
duke
called
me
to
him
and
the
king
come
to
me
of
himself
and
told
me
pepys
says
he
i
do
give
you
thanks
for
your
good
service
all
this
year
and
i
assure
you
i
am
very
sensible
of
it
evelyn
and
i
into
my
lord
brouncker
coach
and
rode
together
with
excellent
discourse
till
we
come
to
clapham
talking
of
the
vanity
and
vices
of
the
court
which
makes
it
a
most
contemptible
thing
and
indeed
in
all
his
discourse
i
find
him
a
most
worthy
person
particularly
he
entertained
me
with
discourse
of
an
infirmary
which
he
hath
projected
for
the
sick
and
wounded
seamen
against
the
next
year
which
i
mightily
approve
of
and
will
endeavour
to
promote
it
being
a
worthy
thing
and
of
use
and
will
save
money
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
been
in
the
church
probably
olave
hart
street
since
i
left
london
for
the
plague
and
it
frighted
me
indeed
to
go
through
the
church
more
than
i
thought
it
could
have
done
to
see
so
many
graves
lie
so
high
upon
the
churchyards
where
people
have
been
buried
of
the
plague
i
was
much
troubled
at
it
and
do
not
think
to
go
through
it
again
a
good
while
i
find
many
about
the
city
that
live
near
the
churchyards
solicitous
to
have
the
churchyards
covered
with
lime
and
i
think
it
is
needfull
and
ours
i
hope
will
be
done
to
my
lord
chancellor
new
house
which
he
is
building
only
to
view
it
hearing
so
much
from
evelyn
of
it
and
indeed
it
is
the
finest
pile
i
ever
did
see
in
my
life
and
will
be
a
glorious
house
to
white
hall
and
to
my
great
joy
people
begin
to
bustle
up
and
down
there
the
king
holding
his
resolution
to
be
in
town
and
hath
good
encouragement
blessed
be
god
to
do
so
the
plague
being
decreased
this
week
to
and
the
total
to
february
my
lord
sandwich
is
come
to
town
with
the
king
and
duke
lord
day
and
my
wife
and
i
the
first
time
together
at
church
since
the
plague
and
now
only
because
of
mills
his
coming
home
to
preach
his
first
sermon
expecting
a
great
excuse
for
his
leaving
the
parish
before
any
body
went
and
now
staying
till
all
are
come
home
but
he
made
but
a
very
poor
and
short
excuse
and
a
bad
sermon
it
was
a
frost
and
had
snowed
last
night
which
covered
the
graves
in
the
churchyard
so
as
i
was
the
less
afraid
for
going
through
lord
brouncker
with
the
king
and
duke
upon
the
water
day
to
see
greenwich
house
and
the
yacht
castle
is
building
of
thence
to
westminster
to
the
exchequer
about
my
tangier
business
and
so
to
westminster
hall
where
the
first
day
of
the
terme
and
the
hall
very
full
of
people
and
much
more
than
was
expected
considering
the
plague
that
hath
been
lord
day
up
and
put
on
a
new
black
cloth
suit
to
an
old
coat
that
i
make
to
be
in
mourning
at
court
where
they
are
all
for
the
king
of
spain
i
to
the
park
and
walked
two
or
three
times
of
the
pell
mell
with
the
company
about
the
king
and
duke
the
duke
speaking
to
me
a
good
deal
there
met
lord
brouncker
and
coventry
and
discoursed
about
the
navy
business
and
all
of
us
much
at
a
loss
that
we
yet
can
hear
nothing
of
sir
jeremy
smith
fleet
that
went
away
to
the
straights
the
middle
of
december
through
all
the
storms
that
we
have
had
since
that
have
driven
back
three
or
four
of
them
with
their
masts
by
the
board
yesterday
come
out
the
declaration
of
war
against
the
french
but
with
such
mild
invitations
of
both
them
and
the
dutch
to
come
over
here
with
promise
of
their
protection
that
every
body
wonders
at
it
comes
caesar
my
boy
whom
i
have
not
seen
since
the
plague
before
but
he
hath
been
in
westminster
hall
all
this
while
very
well
and
tells
me
in
the
height
of
it
how
bold
people
there
were
to
go
in
sport
to
one
burials
and
in
spite
too
ill
people
would
breathe
in
the
faces
out
of
their
windows
of
well
people
going
by
ill
news
this
night
that
the
plague
is
encreased
this
week
and
in
many
places
else
about
the
town
and
at
chatham
and
elsewhere
i
took
hill
to
my
lord
chancellor
new
house
that
is
building
and
went
with
trouble
up
to
the
top
of
it
and
there
is
the
noblest
prospect
that
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
greenwich
being
nothing
to
it
and
in
everything
is
a
beautiful
house
and
most
strongly
built
in
every
respect
and
as
if
as
it
hath
it
had
the
chancellor
for
its
master
i
staid
a
meeting
of
the
duke
of
york
and
the
officers
of
the
navy
and
ordnance
my
lord
treasurer
lying
in
bed
of
the
gowte
hales
john
hayls
or
hales
a
remarkable
for
copying
vandyke
well
and
being
a
rival
of
lely
began
my
wife
portrait
in
the
posture
we
saw
one
of
my
lady
peters
like
a
katharine
while
he
painted
knipp
of
knipp
history
nothing
seems
known
except
that
she
was
a
married
actress
belonging
to
the
king
house
and
as
late
as
her
name
occurs
among
the
performers
in
the
wily
false
one
and
mercer
and
i
sang
we
hear
this
night
of
sir
jeremy
smith
that
he
and
his
fleet
have
been
seen
at
malaga
which
is
good
news
to
the
the
first
time
i
have
been
there
where
very
full
and
company
it
seems
hath
been
there
all
the
plague
time
the
queene
comes
to
hampton
court
it
being
a
brave
day
i
walked
to
white
hall
where
the
queene
and
ladies
are
all
come
i
saw
some
few
of
them
but
not
the
queene
nor
any
of
the
great
beauties
i
am
told
for
certain
what
i
have
heard
once
or
twice
already
of
a
jew
in
town
that
in
the
name
of
the
rest
do
offer
to
give
any
man
to
be
paid
if
a
certain
person
now
at
smyrna
be
within
these
two
years
owned
by
all
the
princes
of
the
east
and
particularly
the
grand
segnor
as
the
king
of
the
world
in
the
same
manner
we
do
the
king
of
england
here
and
that
this
man
is
the
true
messiah
one
named
a
friend
of
his
that
had
received
ten
pieces
in
gold
upon
this
score
and
says
that
the
jew
hath
disposed
of
in
this
manner
which
is
very
strange
and
certainly
this
year
of
will
be
a
year
of
great
action
but
what
the
consequences
of
it
will
be
god
knows
to
white
hall
and
there
saw
the
queene
at
cards
with
many
ladies
but
none
of
our
beauties
were
there
but
glad
i
was
to
see
the
queene
so
well
who
looks
prettily
and
methinks
hath
more
life
than
before
since
it
is
confessed
of
all
that
she
miscarried
lately
clerke
telling
me
yesterday
of
it
at
white
hall
the
details
in
the
original
leave
no
doubt
of
the
fact
and
exculpate
the
chancellor
from
the
charge
of
having
selected
the
queen
as
incapable
of
bearing
children
up
and
to
the
office
where
among
other
businesses
evelyn
proposition
about
publick
infirmarys
was
read
and
agreed
on
he
being
there
and
at
noon
i
took
him
home
to
dinner
being
desirous
of
keeping
my
acquaintance
with
him
and
a
most
excellent
humoured
man
i
still
find
him
and
mighty
knowing
the
duke
did
bring
out
a
book
of
great
antiquity
of
some
of
the
customs
of
the
navy
about
years
since
which
he
did
lend
us
to
read
and
deliver
him
back
again
to
being
invited
to
an
elder
brother
feast
and
there
met
and
sat
by
prin
and
had
good
discourse
about
the
privileges
of
parliament
which
he
says
are
few
to
the
commons
house
and
those
not
examinable
by
them
but
only
by
the
house
of
lords
thence
with
my
lord
brouncker
to
gresham
college
the
first
time
after
the
sickness
that
i
was
there
and
the
second
time
any
met
and
here
a
good
lecture
of
hooke
about
the
trade
of
making
very
pretty
and
anon
alone
with
me
about
the
art
of
drawing
pictures
by
prince
rupert
rule
and
machine
and
another
of
wren
sir
christopher
wren
but
he
says
nothing
do
like
squares
or
which
is
the
best
in
the
world
like
a
darke
roome
we
are
much
troubled
that
the
sickness
in
general
the
town
being
so
full
of
people
should
be
but
three
and
yet
of
the
particular
disease
of
the
plague
there
should
be
ten
encrease
to
my
lord
sandwich
who
did
lie
the
last
night
at
his
house
in
lincoln
inne
fields
it
being
fine
walking
in
the
morning
and
the
streets
full
of
people
again
there
i
staid
and
the
house
full
of
people
come
to
take
leave
of
my
lord
who
this
day
goes
out
of
towne
upon
his
embassy
towards
spayne
and
i
was
glad
to
find
sir
coventry
to
come
though
i
know
it
is
only
a
piece
of
courtshipp
comes
knipp
to
see
my
wife
and
i
spent
all
the
night
talking
with
this
baggage
and
teaching
her
my
song
of
beauty
retire
which
she
sings
and
makes
go
most
rarely
and
a
very
fine
song
it
seems
to
be
she
also
entertained
me
with
repeating
many
of
her
own
and
others
parts
of
the
which
she
do
most
excellently
and
tells
me
the
whole
practices
of
the
and
players
and
is
in
every
respect
most
excellent
company
with
our
coach
of
four
horses
to
windsor
and
so
to
cranborne
about
eleven
and
found
my
lord
sandwich
and
the
ladies
at
a
sermon
in
the
house
which
being
ended
we
to
them
and
all
the
company
glad
to
see
us
and
mighty
merry
to
dinner
here
was
my
lord
and
lord
hinchingbroke
and
sidney
sidney
montagu
lord
sandwich
second
son
sir
charles
herbert
and
carteret
my
lady
carteret
my
lady
jemimah
and
lady
slaning
sir
carteret
daughter
caroline
after
dinner
to
walk
in
the
park
my
lord
and
i
alone
and
he
tells
me
my
lord
of
suffolk
lord
arlington
archbishop
of
canterbury
lord
treasurer
atturny
montagu
sir
thomas
clifford
in
the
house
of
commons
sir
carteret
and
some
others
i
can
not
presently
remember
are
friends
that
i
may
rely
on
for
him
he
dreads
the
issue
of
this
year
and
fears
there
will
be
some
very
great
revolutions
before
his
coming
back
again
he
doubts
it
is
needful
for
him
to
have
a
pardon
for
his
last
year
actions
all
which
he
did
without
commission
and
at
most
but
the
king
private
single
single
word
for
that
of
bergen
but
he
dares
not
ask
it
at
this
time
lest
it
should
make
them
think
that
there
is
something
more
in
it
than
yet
they
know
and
if
it
should
be
denied
it
would
be
of
very
ill
consequence
he
says
also
if
it
should
in
parliament
be
enquired
into
the
selling
of
dunkirke
though
the
chancellor
was
the
man
that
would
have
sold
it
to
france
saying
the
king
of
spain
had
no
money
to
give
for
it
yet
he
will
be
found
to
have
been
the
greatest
adviser
of
it
which
he
is
a
little
apprehensive
may
be
called
upon
by
this
parliament
then
i
with
the
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
played
on
the
guittar
and
mighty
merry
and
anon
to
supper
and
then
my
lord
going
away
to
write
the
young
gentlemen
to
flinging
of
cushions
and
other
mad
sports
till
towards
twelve
at
night
and
then
being
sleepy
i
and
my
wife
in
a
to
bed
and
slept
not
very
well
because
of
noise

up
about
five
in
the
morning
and
my

took
leave
a
little
after

kindly

ob
aged
who
come
to
us
and
carried
us
to
george
chapel
and
there
placed
us
among
the
knights
stalls
and
pretty
the
observation
that
no
man
but
a
woman
may
sit
in
a
place
where
any
are
set
and
hither
come
cushions
to
us
and
a
young
to
bring
us
a
copy
of
the
anthem
to
be
sung
and
here
for
our
sakes
had
this
anthem
and
the
great
service
sung
extraordinary
only
to
entertain
us
it
is
a
noble
place
indeed
and
a
good
quire
of
voices
great
bowing
by
all
the
people
the
poor
knights
in
particularly
to
the
alter
after
prayers
we
to
see
the
plate
of
the
chapel
and
the
robes
of
knights
and
a
man
to
show
us
the
banners
of
the
several
knights
in
being
which
hang
up
over
the
stalls
and
so
to
other
discourse
very
pretty
about
the
order
was
shown
where
the
late
king
is
buried
and
king
henry
the
eighth
and
my
lady
seymour
this
being
done
to
the
king
house
and
to
observe
the
neatness
and
contrivance
of
the
house
and
gates
it
is
the
most
romantique
castle
that
is
in
the
world
but
lord
the
prospect
that
is
in
the
balcone
in
the
queene
lodgings
and
the
terrace
and
walk
are
strange
things
to
consider
being
the
best
in
the
world
sure
and
so
giving
a
great
deal
of
money
to
this
and
that
man
and
woman
we
to
our
tavern
and
there
dined
the
doctor
with
us
and
so
took
coach
and
away
to
eton
the
doctor
with
me
at
eton
i
left
my
wife
in
the
coach
and
he
and
i
to
the
college
and
there
find
all
mighty
fine
the
school
good
and
the
custom
pretty
of
boys
cutting
their
names
in
the
shuts
of
the
windows
when
they
go
to
cambridge
by
which
many
a
one
hath
lived
to
see
himself
a
provost
and
fellow
that
hath
his
name
in
the
window
standing
to
the
hall
and
there
find
the
verses
de
peste
it
being
their
custom
to
make
verses
at
i
read
several
and
very
good
they
were
better
i
think
than
ever
i
made
when
i
was
a
boy
and
in
rolls
as
long
and
longer
than
the
whole
hall
by
much
here
is
a
picture
of
venice
hung
up
and
a
monument
made
of
sir
wotton
giving
it
to
the
college
thence
to
the
porter
in
the
absence
of
the
butler
and
did
drink
of
the
college
beer
which
is
very
good
and
went
into
the
back
fields
to
see
the
scholars
play
and
so
to
the
chapel
and
there
saw
among
other
things
sir
stone
with
this
epitaph
hic
jacet
primus
hujus
sententiae
author
disputandi
pruritus
fit
ecclesiae
scabies
but
unfortunately
the
word
author
was
wrong
writ
and
now
so
basely
altered
that
it
disgraces
the
stone
march
blessed
be
god
a
good
bill
this
week
we
have
being
but
in
all
and
of
the
plague
and
of
them
but
six
in
the
city
though
my
lord
brouncker
says
that
these
six
are
most
of
them
in
new
parishes
where
they
were
not
the
last
week
to
hales
and
there
saw
my
wife
sit
and
i
do
like
her
picture
mightily
and
very
like
it
will
be
and
a
brave
piece
of
work
but
he
do
complain
that
her
nose
hath
cost
him
as
much
work
as
another
face
and
he
hath
done
it
finely
indeed
news
for
certain
of
the
king
of
denmark
declaring
for
the
dutch
and
resolution
to
assist
them
i
find
my
lord
brouncker
and
williams
and
they
would
of
their
own
accord
though
i
had
never
obliged
them
nor
my
wife
neither
with
one
visit
for
many
of
theirs
go
see
my
house
and
my
wife
which
i
showed
them
and
made
them
welcome
with
wine
and
china
oranges
now
a
great
rarity
since
the
war
none
to
be
had
my
house
happened
to
be
mighty
clean
and
did
me
great
honour
and
they
mightily
pleased
with
it
up
betimes
and
to
james
thinking
coventry
had
lain
there
but
he
do
not
but
at
white
hall
so
thither
i
went
to
him
we
walked
an
hour
in
the
matted
gallery
he
of
himself
begun
to
discourse
of
the
unhappy
differences
between
him
and
my
lord
of
sandwich
and
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
did
run
through
all
passages
wherein
my
lord
hath
at
any
time
gathered
any
dissatisfaction
and
cleared
himself
to
me
most
honourably
and
in
truth
i
do
believe
he
do
as
he
says
i
did
afterwards
purge
myself
of
all
partiality
in
the
business
of
sir
carteret
whose
story
sir
coventry
did
also
run
over
that
i
do
mind
the
king
interest
notwithstanding
my
relation
to
him
all
which
he
declares
he
firmly
believes
and
assures
me
he
hath
the
same
kindness
and
opinion
of
me
as
ever
and
when
i
said
i
was
jealous
of
myself
that
having
now
come
to
such
an
income
as
i
am
by
his
favour
i
should
not
be
found
to
do
as
much
service
as
might
deserve
it
he
did
assure
me
he
thinks
it
not
too
much
for
me
but
thinks
i
deserve
it
as
much
as
any
man
in
england
all
this
discourse
did
cheer
my
heart
and
sets
me
right
again
after
a
good
deal
of
melancholy
out
of
fears
of
his
disinclination
to
me
upon
the
difference
with
my
lord
sandwich
and
sir
carteret
but
i
am
satisfied
thoroughly
and
so
went
away
quite
another
man
and
by
the
grace
of
god
will
never
lose
it
again
by
my
folly
in
not
visiting
and
writing
to
him
as
i
used
heretofore
to
do
the
king
and
duke
are
to
go
to
audly
end
in
order
to
the
seeing
and
buying
of
it
of
my
lord
suffolke
made
a
visit
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
to
my
great
joy
find
him
the
same
man
to
me
that
heretofore
which
i
was
in
great
doubt
of
through
my
negligence
in
not
visiting
of
him
a
great
while
and
having
now
set
all
to
rights
there
i
shall
never
suffer
matters
to
run
so
far
backwards
again
as
i
have
done
of
late
with
reference
to
my
neglecting
him
and
sir
coventry
the
truth
is
i
do
indulge
myself
a
little
the
more
in
pleasure
knowing
that
this
is
the
proper
age
of
my
life
to
do
it
and
out
of
my
observation
that
most
men
that
do
thrive
in
the
world
do
forget
to
take
pleasure
during
the
time
that
they
are
getting
their
estate
but
reserve
that
till
they
have
got
one
and
then
it
is
too
late
for
them
to
enjoy
it
my
uncle
talbot
pepys
died
the
last
week
all
the
news
now
is
that
sir
jeremy
smith
is
at
cales
cadiz
with
his
fleet
and
mings
in
the
elve
the
king
is
come
this
noon
to
town
from
audly
end
with
the
duke
of
york
and
a
fine
train
of
gentlemen
the
plague
encreased
this
week
from
though
the
total
fallen
from
to
with
my
lord
brouncker
towards
london
and
in
our
way
called
in
covent
garden
and
took
in
sir
john
formerly
baber
who
hath
this
humour
that
he
will
not
enter
into
discourse
while
any
stranger
is
in
company
till
he
be
told
who
he
is
that
seems
a
stranger
to
him
this
he
did
declare
openly
to
me
and
asked
my
lord
who
i
was
thence
to
guildhall
in
our
way
taking
in
wilkins
and
there
my
lord
and
i
had
full
and
large
discourse
with
sir
thomas
player
one
of
the
city
members
in
the
oxford
and
westminster
parliaments
see
more
of
him
in
the
notes
by
scott
to
absalom
and
achitophel
in
which
poem
he
is
introduced
under
the
designation
of
railing
rabsheka
the
chamberlain
of
the
city
a
man
i
have
much
heard
of
about
the
credit
of
our
tallies
which
are
lodged
there
for
security
to
such
as
should
lend
money
thereon
to
the
use
of
the
navy
i
had
great
satisfaction
therein
and
the
truth
is
i
find
all
our
matters
of
credit
to
be
in
an
ill
condition
to
walk
all
alone
in
the
fields
behind
grayes
inne
making
an
end
of
reading
over
my
dear
faber
fortunae
of
my
lord
bacon
to
hales
where
i
met
my
wife
and
people
and
do
find
the
picture
above
all
things
a
most
pretty
picture
and
mighty
like
my
wife
and
i
asked
him
his
price
he
says
and
the
truth
is
i
think
he
do
deserve
it
to
hales
and
paid
him
for
the
picture
and
for
the
frame
this
day
i
began
to
sit
and
he
will
make
me
i
think
a
very
fine
picture
he
promises
it
shall
be
as
good
as
my
wife
and
i
sit
to
have
it
full
of
shadows
and
do
almost
break
my
neck
looking
over
my
shoulder
to
make
the
posture
for
him
to
work
by
home
having
a
great
cold
so
to
bed
drinking
after
dinner
we
walked
to
the
king
all
in
dirt
they
being
altering
of
the
stage
to
make
it
wider
but
god
knows
when
they
will
begin
to
act
again
but
my
business
here
was
to
see
the
inside
of
the
stage
and
all
the
and
machines
and
indeed
it
was
a
sight
worthy
seeing
but
to
see
their
clothes
and
the
various
sorts
and
what
a
mixture
of
things
there
was
here
a
there
a
ruff
here
a
horse
there
a
crown
would
make
a
man
split
himself
with
laughing
and
particularly
lacy
john
lacy
the
celebrated
comedian
author
of
four
plays
ob
wardrobe
and
shotrell
robert
and
william
shotterel
both
belonged
to
the
king
company
at
the
opening
of
their
new
theatre
in
one
of
them
had
been
to
the
troop
of
horse
in
which
hart
was
serving
as
lieutenant
under
charles
the
standard
he
is
called
by
downs
a
good
actor
but
nothing
further
is
recorded
of
his
merits
or
career
note
to
apology
but
then
again
to
think
now
fine
they
show
on
the
stage
by
and
how
poor
things
they
are
to
look
at
too
near
hand
is
not
pleasant
at
all
the
machines
are
fine
and
the
paintings
very
pretty
with
sir
warren
talking
of
many
things
belonging
to
us
particularly
and
i
hope
to
get
something
considerably
by
him
before
the
year
be
over
he
gives
me
good
advice
of
circumspection
in
my
place
which
i
am
now
in
great
mind
to
improve
for
i
think
our
office
stands
on
very
ticklish
terms
the
parliament
likely
to
sit
shortly
and
likely
to
be
asked
more
money
and
we
able
to
give
a
very
bad
account
of
the
expence
of
what
we
have
done
with
what
they
did
give
before
besides
the
turning
out
the
prize
officers
may
be
an
example
for
the
king
giving
us
up
to
parliament
pleasure
as
easily
for
we
deserve
it
as
much
besides
sir
carteret
did
tell
me
night
how
my
lord
brouncker
whose
i
could
have
depended
as
much
on
as
any
did
himself
to
him
take
notice
of
the
many
places
i
have
and
though
i
was
a
painful
man
yet
the
navy
was
enough
for
any
man
to
go
through
with
in
his
own
single
place
there
which
much
troubles
me
and
shall
yet
provoke
me
to
more
and
more
care
and
diligence
than
ever
sir
robert
long
sir
robert
long
secretary
to
charles
ii
during
his
exile
and
subsequently
made
auditor
of
the
exchequer
and
a
privy
counsellor
and
created
a
baronet
ob
unmarried
told
us
of
the
plenty
of
partridges
in
france
where
he
says
the
king
of
france
and
his
company
killed
with
their
guns
in
the
plain
de
versailles
and
odd
partridges
at
one
bout
with
sir
warren
who
tells
me
that
at
the
committee
of
the
lords
for
the
prizes
there
passed
very
high
words
between
my
lord
ashly
and
sir
coventry
about
our
business
of
the
prize
ships
and
that
my
lord
ashly
did
snuff
and
talk
as
high
to
him
as
he
used
to
do
to
any
ordinary
man
and
that
sir
coventry
did
take
it
very
quietly
but
yet
for
all
did
speak
his
mind
soberly
and
with
reason
and
went
away
saying
that
he
had
done
his
duty
therein
after
the
committee
up
i
had
occasion
to
follow
the
duke
into
his
lodgings
into
a
chamber
where
the
duchesse
was
sitting
to
have
her
picture
drawn
by
lilly
who
was
then
at
work
but
i
was
well
pleased
to
see
that
there
was
nothing
near
so
much
resemblance
of
her
face
in
his
work
which
is
now
the
second
if
not
the
third
time
as
there
was
of
my
wife
at
the
very
first
time
nor
do
i
think
at
last
it
can
be
like
the
lines
not
being
in
proportion
to
those
of
her
face
my
lord
brouncker
and
i
to
the
tower
to
see
the
famous
engraver
to
get
him
to
grave
a
seal
for
the
office
and
did
see
some
of
the
finest
pieces
of
work
in
embossed
work
that
ever
i
did
see
in
my
life
for
fineness
and
smallness
of
the
images
thereon
to
the
cockpitt
and
dined
with
a
great
deal
of
company
at
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
a
bad
and
dirty
nasty
dinner
this
night
i
am
told
the
queene
of
portugall
the
mother
to
our
queene
is
lately
dead
and
news
brought
of
it
hither
this
day
i
out
to
and
there
received
and
brought
it
home
and
contrary
to
expectation
received
for
the
use
of
of
it
for
a
quarter
of
a
year
where
it
hath
produced
me
this
profit
and
hath
been
a
convenience
to
me
as
to
care
and
security
at
my
house
and
demandable
at
two
warning
as
this
hath
been
to
hales
and
there
sat
till
almost
quite
dark
upon
working
my
gowne
which
i
hired
to
be
drawn
in
an
indian
gowne
april
to
charing
cross
to
wait
on
sir
philip
howard
whom
i
found
in
bed
and
he
do
receive
me
very
civilly
my
request
was
about
suffering
my
wife
brother
to
go
to
sea
and
to
save
his
pay
in
the
duke
guards
which
after
a
little
difficulty
he
did
with
great
respect
agree
to
i
find
him
a
very
gentleman
and
one
of
great
parts
and
very
courteous
meeting
allen
probably
thomas
allen
of
caius
college
cambridge
and
member
of
the
college
of
physicians
ob
the
physician
he
and
i
and
another
walked
in
the
park
a
most
pleasant
warm
day
and
to
the
chapel
where
i
do
not
so
dislike
the
musick
here
i
saw
on
a
post
an
invitation
to
all
good
catholics
to
pray
for
the
soul
of
such
a
one
departed
this
life
the
queene
i
hear
do
not
yet
hear
of
the
death
of
her
mother
she
being
in
a
course
of
physick
that
they
dare
not
tell
it
her
up
and
down
my
lord
albans
his
new
building
and
looking
to
and
again
into
every
place
building
i
this
afternoon
made
a
visit
to
my
lady
carteret
whom
i
understood
newly
come
to
towne
and
she
took
it
mighty
kindly
but
i
see
her
face
and
heart
are
dejected
from
the
condition
her
husband
matters
stand
in
but
i
hope
they
will
do
all
well
enough
and
i
do
comfort
her
as
much
as
i
can
for
she
is
a
noble
lady
the
plague
is
to
our
great
grief
encreased
nine
this
week
though
decreased
a
few
in
the
total
and
this
encrease
runs
through
many
parishes
which
makes
us
much
fear
the
next
year
met
by
agreement
with
sir
stephen
fox
and
ashburnham
and
discoursed
the
business
of
our
excise
tallies
the
former
being
treasurer
of
the
guards
and
the
other
cofferer
of
the
king
household
this
day
great
news
of
the
swedes
declaring
for
us
against
the
dutch
and
so
far
as
that
i
believe
it
to
the
duke
of
york
where
we
all
met
to
hear
the
debate
between
sir
thomas
allen
and
wayth
the
former
complaining
of
the
latter
ill
usage
of
him
at
the
late
pay
of
his
ship
but
a
very
sorry
poor
occasion
he
had
for
it
the
duke
did
determine
it
with
great
judgement
chiding
both
but
encouraging
wayth
to
continue
to
be
a
check
to
all
captains
in
any
thing
to
the
right
and
indeed
i
never
did
see
the
duke
do
any
thing
more
in
order
nor
with
more
judgement
than
he
did
pass
the
verdict
in
this
business
the
court
full
this
morning
of
the
news
of
tom
cheffins
death
the
king
sir
walker
garter
king
at
arms
in
gave
a
grant
of
arms
gratis
to
thomas
chiffinch
one
of
the
pages
of
his
bedchamber
keeper
of
his
private
closet
and
comptroller
of
the
excise
his
brother
william
appears
to
have
succeeded
to
the
two
appointments
and
became
a
great
favourite
with
the
king
whom
he
survived
there
is
a
portrait
of
william
chiffinch
at
gorhamburg
he
was
well
last
night
as
ever
playing
at
tables
in
the
house
and
not
very
ill
this
morning
at
six
yet
dead
before
seven
they
think
of
an
imposthume
in
his
breast
but
it
looks
fearfully
among
people
the
plague
as
we
hear
encreasing
every
where
again
to
the
chapel
but
could
not
get
in
to
hear
well
but
i
had
the
pleasure
once
in
my
life
to
see
an
archbishop
this
was
of
york
richard
sterne
bishop
of
carlisle
elected
archbishop
of
york
ob
in
a
pulpit
then
at
a
loss
how
to
get
home
to
dinner
having
promised
to
carry
hunt
thither
at
last
got
my
lord
hinchingbroke
coach
he
staying
at
court
and
so
took
her
up
in
and
home
and
dined
and
good
discourse
of
the
old
matters
of
the
protector
and
his
family
she
having
a
relation
to
them
the
protector
lives
in
france
spends
about
per
annum
by
coach
to
pierce
and
with
her
and
knipp
and
pierce
boy
and
girl
abroad
thinking
to
have
been
merry
at
chelsey
but
being
come
almost
to
the
house
by
coach
near
the
waterside
a
house
alone
i
think
the
swan
a
gentleman
walking
by
called
to
us
to
tell
us
that
the
house
was
shut
up
of
the
sickness
so
we
with
great
affright
turned
back
being
holden
to
the
gentleman
and
went
away
i
for
my
part
in
great
disorder
for
kensington
to
hales
where
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
more
to
my
picture
this
potrait
is
now
in
the
possession
of
samuel
pepys
cockerel
esq
but
the
musique
which
now
pleases
me
mightily
it
being
painted
true
to
gresham
college
where
a
great
deal
of
do
and
formality
in
choosing
of
the
council
and
officers
i
had
three
votes
to
be
of
the
council
who
am
but
a
stranger
nor
expected
any
walked
into
the
park
to
the
queen
chapel
and
there
heard
a
good
deal
of
their
mass
and
some
of
their
musique
which
is
not
so
contemptible
i
think
as
our
people
would
make
it
it
pleasing
me
very
well
and
indeed
better
than
the
anthem
i
heard
afterwards
at
white
hall
at
my
coming
back
i
staid
till
the
king
went
down
to
receive
the
sacrament
and
stood
in
his
closet
with
a
great
many
others
and
there
saw
him
receive
it
which
i
did
never
see
the
manner
of
before
thence
walked
to
pierce
and
there
dined
very
good
company
and
good
discourse
they
being
able
to
tell
me
all
the
businesses
of
the
court
the
amours
and
the
mad
doings
that
are
there
how
for
certain
stewart
is
become
the
king
mistress
and
that
the
king
hath
many
bastard
children
that
are
known
and
owned
besides
the
duke
of
monmouth
to
lilly
the
painter
and
there
saw
the
heads
some
finished
and
all
begun
of
the
flaggmen
in
the
late
great
fight
with
the
duke
of
york
against
the
dutch
the
duke
of
york
hath
them
done
to
hang
in
his
chamber
and
very
finely
they
are
done
indeed
here
are
the
prince
sir
askue
sir
thomas
teddiman
sir
christopher
mings
sir
joseph
jordan
sir
william
berkeley
sir
thomas
allen
and
captain
harman
afterwards
sir
john
harman
as
also
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
will
be
my
lord
sandwich
sir
pen
and
sir
jeremy
smith
i
was
very
well
satisfied
with
this
sight
and
other
good
pictures
hanging
in
the
house
i
down
to
walk
in
the
garden
at
white
hall
it
being
a
mighty
hot
and
pleasant
day
and
there
was
the
king
who
among
others
talked
to
us
a
little
and
among
other
pretty
things
he
swore
merrily
that
he
believed
the
ketch
that
sir
batten
bought
the
last
year
at
colchester
was
of
his
own
getting
it
was
so
thick
to
its
length
another
pleasant
thing
he
said
of
christopher
pett
commanding
him
that
he
will
not
alter
his
moulds
of
ships
upon
any
man
advice
as
says
he
commissioner
taylor
i
fear
do
of
his
new
london
that
he
makes
it
differ
in
hopes
of
mending
the
old
london
built
by
him
for
says
he
he
finds
that
god
hath
put
him
into
the
right
and
so
will
keep
in
it
while
he
is
in
and
says
the
king
i
am
sure
it
must
be
god
put
him
in
for
no
art
of
his
own
ever
could
have
done
it
for
it
seems
he
can
not
give
a
good
account
of
what
he
do
as
an
artist
thence
with
my
lord
brouncker
in
his
coach
to
hide
parke
the
first
time
i
have
been
there
this
year
there
the
king
was
but
i
was
sorry
to
see
my
lady
castlemaine
for
the
mourning
forceing
all
the
ladies
to
go
in
black
with
their
hair
plain
and
without
spots
i
find
her
to
be
a
much
more
ordinary
woman
than
ever
i
durst
have
thought
she
was
and
indeed
is
not
so
pretty
as
stewart
to
the
cockpitt
and
there
took
my
leave
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
who
is
going
to
sea
he
seems
mightily
pleased
with
me
which
i
am
glad
of
but
i
do
find
infinitely
my
concernment
in
being
careful
to
appear
to
the
king
and
duke
to
continue
my
care
of
his
business
and
to
be
found
diligent
as
i
used
to
be
to
white
hall
where
i
had
the
opportunity
to
take
leave
of
the
prince
and
again
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
saw
them
kiss
the
king
hands
and
the
duke
and
much
content
indeed
there
seems
to
be
in
all
people
at
their
going
to
sea
and
they
promise
themselves
much
good
from
them
this
morning
the
house
of
parliament
do
meet
only
to
adjourne
again
till
winter
the
plague
i
hear
encreases
in
the
town
much
and
exceedingly
in
the
country
every
where
bonfires
in
the
street
for
being
day
and
the
king
coronation
and
the
day
of
the
prince
and
duke
going
to
sea
i
to
the
office
where
prin
come
to
meet
about
the
and
till
company
come
did
discourse
with
me
a
good
while
in
the
garden
about
the
laws
of
england
telling
me
the
main
faults
in
them
and
among
others
their
obscurity
through
multitude
of
long
statutes
which
he
is
about
to
abstract
out
of
all
of
a
sort
and
as
he
lives
and
parliaments
come
get
them
put
into
laws
and
the
other
statutes
repealed
and
then
it
will
be
a
short
work
to
know
the
law
having
supped
upon
the
leads
to
bed
the
plague
blessed
be
god
is
decreased
sixteen
this
week
to
evelyn
where
i
walked
in
his
garden
till
he
come
from
church
with
great
pleasure
reading
ridly
discourse
all
my
way
going
and
coming
upon
the
civill
and
ecclesiastical
law
he
being
come
home
he
and
i
walked
together
in
the
garden
with
mighty
pleasure
he
being
a
very
ingenious
man
and
the
more
i
know
him
the
more
i
love
him
i
after
dinner
to
even
all
my
accounts
of
this
month
and
bless
god
i
find
myself
notwithstanding
great
expences
of
late
viz
now
to
pay
for
a
necklace
near
for
a
set
of
chairs
and
couch
near
for
my
three
pictures
yet
i
do
gather
and
am
worth
my
wife
comes
home
by
and
by
and
hath
pitched
upon
a
necklace
with
three
rows
which
is
a
very
good
one
and
is
the
price
so
ends
this
month
with
great
good
health
and
gettings
and
advanced
well
in
the
whole
of
my
estate
for
which
god
make
me
thankful
may
at
noon
my
cosen
thomas
pepys
did
come
to
me
to
consult
about
the
business
of
his
being
a
justice
of
the
peace
which
he
is
much
against
and
among
other
reasons
tells
me
as
a
confidant
that
he
is
not
free
to
exercise
punishment
according
to
the
act
against
quakers
and
other
people
for
religion
nor
do
he
understand
latin
and
so
is
not
capable
of
the
place
as
formerly
now
all
warrants
do
run
in
latin
nor
he
in
kent
though
he
be
of
deptford
parish
his
house
standing
in
surry
however
i
did
bring
him
to
incline
towards
it
if
he
be
pressed
to
take
it
i
do
think
it
may
be
some
repute
to
me
to
have
my
kinsman
in
commission
there
specially
if
he
behave
himself
to
content
in
the
country
met
sir
downing
on
white
hall
bridge
and
there
walked
half
an
hour
talking
of
the
success
of
the
late
new
act
and
indeed
it
is
very
much
that
that
hath
stood
really
in
the
room
of
there
appears
to
be
some
error
in
these
figures
now
since
christmas
being
itself
but
and
so
i
do
really
take
it
to
be
a
very
considerable
thing
done
by
him
for
the
beginning
end
and
every
part
of
it
is
to
be
imputed
to
him
the
fleet
is
not
yet
gone
from
the
nore
the
plague
encreases
in
many
places
and
is
this
week
with
us
into
margett
st
margaret
church
where
i
heard
a
young
man
play
the
fool
upon
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
i
to
my
lord
crowe
who
is
very
lately
come
to
town
and
he
talked
for
half
an
hour
of
the
business
of
the
warr
wherein
he
is
very
doubtful
from
our
want
of
money
that
we
shall
fail
and
i
do
concur
with
him
therein
after
some
little
discourse
of
ordinary
matters
i
away
to
sir
philip
warwick
again
and
he
was
come
in
and
gone
out
to
my
lord
treasurer
whither
i
followed
him
and
there
my
business
was
to
be
told
that
my
lord
treasurer
hath
got
for
us
in
the
navy
to
answer
our
great
necessities
which
i
did
thank
him
for
but
the
sum
is
not
considerable
the
five
brothers
houblons
came
and
hill
to
my
house
and
a
very
good
supper
we
had
and
good
discourse
with
great
pleasure
my
new
plate
sets
off
my
cupboard
very
nobly
here
they
were
till
about
eleven
at
night
and
a
fine
sight
it
is
to
see
these
five
brothers
thus
loving
one
to
another
and
all
industrious
merchants
two
of
these
brothers
sir
james
and
sir
john
houblon
knts
and
aldermen
rose
to
great
wealth
the
former
represented
the
city
of
london
and
the
latter
became
lord
mayor
in
the
following
epitaph
in
memory
of
their
father
who
was
interred
in
the
church
of
mary
woolnoth
is
here
inserted
as
having
been
written
by
pepys
jacobus

deane
and
i
did
discourse
about
his
ship
rupert
built
by
him
there
which
succeeds
so
well
as
he
hath
got
great
honour
by
it
and
i
some
by
recommending
him
the
king
duke
and
every
body
saying
it
is
the
best
ship
that
was
ever
built
and
then
he
fell
to
explain
to
me
his
manner
of
casting
the
draught
of
water
which
a
ship
will
draw
beforehand
which
is
a
secret
the
king
and
all
admire
in
him
and
he
is
the
first
that
hath
come
to
any
certainty
beforehand
of
foretelling
the
draught
of
water
of
a
ship
before
she
be
launched
i
discoursed
awhile
with
yeabsly
whom
i
met
and
took
up
in
my
coach
with
me
and
who
hath
this
day
presented
my
lord
ashly
with
to
bespeak
his
friendship
to
him
in
his
accounts
now
before
us
and
my
lord
hath
received
and
so
i
believe
is
as
bad
as
to
bribes
as
what
the
world
says
of
him
i
away
in
some
haste
to
my
lord
ashly
where
it
is
stupendous
to
see
how
favourably
and
yet
closely
my
lord
ashly
carries
himself
to
yeabsly
in
his
business
so
as
i
think
we
shall
do
his
business
for
him
in
very
good
manner
but
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
thing
to
observe
and
that
which
i
would
not
but
have
had
the
observation
of
for
a
great
deal
of
money
towards
white
hall
calling
in
my
way
on
my
lord
bellasses
john
lord
bellassis
second
son
of
thomas
viscount
falconberg
an
officer
of
distinction
on
the
king
side
during
the
civil
war
he
was
afterwards
governor
of
tangier
and
captain
of
the
band
of
gentlemen
pensioners
being
a
catholic
the
test
act
deprived
him
of
all
his
appointments
in
but
james
ii
in
made
him
first
commissioner
of
the
treasury
ob
where
i
come
to
his
bedside
and
he
did
give
me
a
full
and
long
account
of
his
matters
how
he
kept
them
at
tangier
declares
himself
fully
satisfied
with
my
care
seems
cunningly
to
argue
for
encreasing
the
number
of
men
there
told
me
the
whole
story
of
his
gains
by
the
turky
prizes
which
he
owns
he
hath
got
about
by
promised
me
the
same
profits
povy
was
to
have
had
and
in
fine
i
find
him
a
pretty
subtle
man
and
so
i
left
him
staid
at
sir
carteret
chamber
till
the
council
rose
and
then
he
and
i
by
agreement
this
morning
went
forth
in
his
coach
by
tiburne
to
the
park
discoursing
of
the
state
of
the
navy
as
to
money
and
the
state
of
the
kingdom
too
how
ill
able
to
raise
more
and
of
our
office
as
to
the
condition
of
the
officers
he
giving
me
caution
as
to
myself
that
there
are
those
that
are
my
enemies
as
well
as
his
and
by
name
my
lord
brouncker
who
hath
said
some
odd
speeches
against
me
so
that
he
advises
me
to
stand
on
my
guard
which
i
shall
do
and
unless
my
addiction
to
pleasure
undo
me
will
be
acute
enough
for
any
of
them
a
gentleman
arrived
here
this
day
brown
of
maloes
among
other
things
tells
me
the
meaning
of
the
setting
out
of
dogs
every
night
out
of
the
town
walls
which
are
said
to
secure
the
city
but
it
is
not
so
but
only
to
secure
the
anchors
cables
and
ships
that
lie
dry
which
might
otherwise
in
the
night
be
liable
to
be
robbed
and
these
dogs
are
set
out
every
night
and
called
together
in
every
morning
by
a
man
with
a
horne
and
they
go
in
very
orderly
home
this
evening
but
with
great
trouble
in
the
streets
by
bonfires
it
being
the
king
and
day
of
restoration
but
lord
to
see
the
difference
how
many
there
were
on
the
other
side
and
so
few
ours
the
city
side
of
the
temple
would
make
one
wonder
the
difference
between
the
temper
of
one
sort
of
people
and
the
other
and
the
difference
among
all
between
what
they
do
now
and
what
it
was
the
night
when
monk
came
into
the
city
such
a
night
as
that
i
never
think
to
see
again
nor
think
it
can
be
i
find
the
duke
gone
out
with
the
king
on
hunting
a
public
appointed
to
pray
for
the
good
success
of
the
fleet
but
it
is
a
pretty
thing
to
consider
how
little
a
matter
they
make
of
this
keeping
of
a
fast
that
it
was
not
so
much
as
declared
time
enough
to
be
read
in
the
churches
the
last
sunday
but
ordered
by
proclamation
since
i
suppose
upon
some
sudden
news
of
the
dutch
being
come
out
as
to
public
business
by
late
tidings
of
the
french
fleet
being
come
to
rochell
how
true
though
i
know
not
our
fleet
is
divided
prince
rupert
being
gone
with
about
thirty
ships
to
the
westward
as
is
conceived
to
meet
the
french
to
hinder
their
coming
to
join
with
the
dutch
my
lord
duke
of
albemarle
lies
in
the
downes
with
the
rest
and
intends
presently
to
sail
to
the
gunfleete
june
up
and
to
the
office
where
certain
news
is
brought
us
of
a
letter
come
to
the
king
this
morning
from
the
duke
of
albemarle
dated
yesterday
at
eleven
as
they
were
sailing
to
the
gunfleete
that
they
were
in
sight
of
the
dutch
fleet
and
were
fitting
themselves
to
fight
them
so
that
they
are
ere
this
certainly
engaged
besides
several
do
averr
they
heard
the
guns
yesterday
in
the
afternoon
this
put
us
at
the
board
into
a
tosse
presently
come
orders
for
our
sending
away
to
the
fleet
a
recruite
of
soldiers
so
i
rose
from
the
table
and
to
the
and
thence
upon
the
river
among
several
vessels
to
consider
of
the
sending
them
away
and
lastly
down
to
greenwich
and
there
appointed
two
yachts
to
be
ready
for
them
and
did
order
the
soldiers
to
march
to
blackewall
having
set
all
things
in
order
against
the
next
flood
i
went
on
shore
with
captain
erwin
at
greenwich
and
into
the
parke
and
there
we
could
hear
the
guns
from
the
fleete
most
plainly
we
walked
to
the
and
there
seeing
the
king
and
duke
come
down
in
their
barge
to
i
to
them
and
did
give
them
an
account
what
i
was
doing
they
went
up
to
the
park
to
hear
the
guns
of
the
fleet
go
off
all
our
hopes
now
are
that
prince
rupert
with
his
fleet
is
coming
back
and
will
be
with
the
fleet
this
even
a
message
being
sent
to
him
for
that
purpose
on
wednesday
last
and
a
return
is
come
from
him
this
morning
that
he
did
intend
to
sail
from
point
about
four
in
the
afternoon
yesterday
which
gives
us
great
hopes
the
wind
being
very
fair
that
he
is
with
them
this
even
and
the
fresh
going
off
of
the
guns
makes
us
believe
the
same
down
to
blackewall
and
there
saw
the
soldiers
who
were
by
this
time
gotten
most
of
them
drunk
shipped
off
but
lord
to
see
how
the
poor
fellows
kissed
their
wives
and
in
that
simple
manner
at
their
going
off

pretty

news
of
any
fight
having
put
the

and
there
met
with
coventry

tells
me

only
news
from
the
fleet
is
brought
by
captain
elliott
of
the
portland
which
by
being
run
on
board
by
the
guernsey
was
disabled
from
staying
abroad
so
is
come
in
to
albrough
that
he
saw
one
of
the
dutch
great
ships
blown
up
and
three
on
fire
that
they
begun
to
fight
on
friday
and
at
his
coming
into
port
could
make
another
ship
of
the
king
coming
in
which
he
judged
to
be
the
rupert
that
he
knows
of
no
other
hurt
to
our
ships
with
this
good
news
i
home
by
water
again
the
exchange
as
full
of
people
and
hath
been
all
this
noon
as
of
any
other
day
only
for
news
to
white
hall
and
there
met
with
this
bad
news
farther
that
the
prince
come
to
dover
but
at
ten
last
night
and
there
heard
nothing
of
a
fight
so
that
we
are
defeated
of
all
our
hopes
of
his
help
to
the
fleet
it
is
also
reported
by
some
victuallers
that
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
holmes
sir
robert
holmes
their
flags
were
shot
down
and
both
fain
to
come
to
anchor
to
renew
their
rigging
and
sails
a
letter
is
also
come
this
afternoon
from
harman
in
the
henery
which
states
that
she
was
taken
by
elliott
for
the
rupert
that
being
fallen
into
the
body
of
the
dutch
fleet
he
made
his
way
through
them
was
set
on
by
three
one
after
another
got
two
of
them
off
and
disabled
the
third
was
set
on
fire
himself
upon
which
many
of
his
men
leapt
into
the
sea
and
perished
among
others
the
parson
first
have
lost
above
men
and
a
good
many
women
god
knows
what
is
become
of
balty
balthazar
michel
pepys
brother
employed
in
the
office
for
sick
and
hurt
at
deal
afterwards
and
in
commissioner
at
woolwich
and
deptford
and
at
last
quenched
his
own
fire
and
got
to
albrough
being
as
all
say
the
greatest
hazard
that
ever
any
ship
escaped
and
so
bravely
managed
by
him
the
mast
of
the
third
fire
ship
fell
into
their
ship
on
fire
and
hurt
harman
leg
which
makes
him
lame
now
but
not
dangerous
i
to
sir
carteret
who
told
me
there
hath
been
great
bad
management
in
all
this
that
the
king
orders
that
went
on
friday
for
calling
back
the
prince
were
sent
but
by
the
ordinary
post
on
wednesday
and
come
to
the
prince
his
hands
but
on
friday
and
then
instead
of
sailing
presently
he
stays
till
four
in
the
evening
and
that
which
is
worst
of
all
the
hampshire
laden
with
merchants
money
come
from
the
straights
set
out
with
or
but
just
before
the
fleet
and
was
in
the
downes
by
five
in
the
clock
yesterday
morning
and
the
prince
with
his
fleet
come
to
dover
but
at
ten
of
the
clock
at
night
this
is
hard
to
answer
if
it
be
true
this
puts
great
astonishment
into
the
king
and
duke
and
court
every
body
being
out
of
countenance
home
by
the
which
is
full
of
people
still
and
all
talk
highly
of
the
failure
of
the
prince
in
not
making
more
haste
after
his
instructions
did
come
and
of
our
managements
here
in
not
giving
it
sooner
and
with
more
care
and
oftener
to
white
hall
where
when
we
come
we
find
the
duke
at
james
whither
he
is
lately
gone
to
lodge
so
walking
through
the
park
we
saw
hundreds
of
people
listening
at
the
and
to
and
again
in
the
park
to
hear
the
guns
i
saw
a
letter
dated
last
night
from
strowd
governor
of
dover
castle
which
sags
that
the
prince
come
thither
the
night
before
with
his
fleet
but
that
for
the
guns
which
we
writ
that
we
heard
it
is
only
a
mistake
for
thunder
and
so
far
as
to
yesterday
it
is
a
miraculous
thing
that
we
all
friday
and
saturday
and
yesterday
did
hear
every
where
most
plainly
the
guns
go
off
and
yet
at
deal
and
dover
to
last
night
they
did
not
hear
one
word
of
a
fight
nor
think
they
heard
one
gun
this
added
to
what
i
have
set
down
before
the
other
day
about
the
katharine
makes
room
for
a
great
dispute
in
philosophy
how
we
should
hear
it
and
they
not
the
same
wind
that
brought
it
to
us
being
the
same
that
should
bring
it
to
them
but
so
it
is
major
halsey
however
he
was
sent
down
on
purpose
to
hear
news
did
bring
news
this
morning
that
he
did
see
the
prince
and
his
fleet
at
nine
of
the
clock
yesterday
morning
four
or
five
leagues
to
sea
behind
the
goodwin
so
that
by
the
hearing
of
the
guns
this
morning
we
conclude
he
is
come
to
the
fleet
after
wayting
upon
the
duke
with
sir
pen
who
was
commanded
to
go
by
water
down
to
harwich
to
dispatch
away
all
the
ships
he
can
i
home
where
no
sooner
come
but
news
is
brought
me
of
a
couple
of
men
come
to
speak
with
me
from
the
fleet
so
i
down
and
who
should
it
be
but
daniel
all
muffled
up
and
his
face
as
black
as
the
chimney
and
covered
with
dirt
pitch
and
tar
and
powder
and
muffled
with
dirty
clouts
and
his
right
eye
stopped
with
okum
he
is
come
last
night
at
five
from
the
fleet
with
a
comrade
of
his
that
hath
endangered
another
eye
they
were
set
on
shore
at
harwich
this
morning
and
at
two
in
a
catch
with
about
twenty
more
wounded
men
from
the
royall
charles
they
being
able
to
ride
took
post
about
three
this
morning
and
were
here
between
eleven
and
twelve
i
went
presently
into
the
coach
with
them
and
carried
them
to
and
there
took
water
all
the
world
gazing
upon
us
and
concluding
it
to
be
news
from
the
fleet
and
every
face
appeared
expecting
of
news
to
the
and
left
them
at
coventry
lodgings
he
though
not
being
there
and
so
i
into
the
park
to
the
king
and
told
him
my
lord
generall
was
well
the
last
night
at
five
and
the
prince
come
with
his
fleet
and
joyned
with
his
about
seven
the
king
was
mightily
pleased
with
this
news
and
so
took
me
by
the
hand
and
talked
a
little
of
it
giving
him
the
best
account
i
could
and
then
he
bid
me
to
fetch
the
two
seamen
to
him
he
walking
into
the
house
so
i
went
and
fetched
the
seamen
into
the
same
room
to
him
and
there
he
heard
the
whole
account
the
fight
how
we
found
the
dutch
fleet
at
anchor
on
friday
half
seas
over
between
dunkirke
and
ostend
and
made
them
let
slip
their
anchors
they
about
ninety
and
we
less
than
sixty
we
fought
them
and
put
them
to
the
run
till
they
met
with
about
sixteen
sail
of
fresh
ships
and
so
bore
up
again
the
fight
continued
till
night
and
then
again
the
next
morning
from
five
till
seven
at
night
and
so
too
yesterday
morning
they
begun
again
and
continued
till
about
four
they
chasing
us
for
the
most
part
of
saturday
and
yesterday
we
flying
from
them
the
duke
himself
and
then
those
people
who
were
put
into
the
catch
by
and
by
spied
the
prince
fleet
coming
upon
which
de
ruyter
called
a
little
council
being
in
chase
at
this
time
of
us
and
thereupon
their
fleet
divided
into
two
squadrons
forty
in
one
and
about
thirty
in
the
other
the
fleet
being
at
first
about
ninety
but
by
one
accident
or
other
supposed
to
be
lessened
to
about
seventy
the
bigger
to
follow
the
duke
the
less
to
meet
the
prince
but
the
prince
come
up
with
the
generall
fleet
and
the
dutch
come
together
again
and
bore
towards
their
own
coast
and
we
with
them
and
now
what
the
consequence
of
this
day
will
be
we
know
not
the
duke
was
forced
to
come
to
anchor
on
friday
having
lost
his
sails
and
rigging
no
particular
person
spoken
of
to
be
hurt
but
sir
clerke
who
hath
lost
his
leg
and
bore
it
bravely
the
duke
himself
had
a
little
hurt
in
his
thigh
but
signified
little
the
king
did
pull
out
of
his
pocket
about
twenty
pieces
in
gold
and
did
give
it
daniel
for
himself
and
his
companion
and
so
parted
mightily
pleased
with
the
account
he
did
give
him
of
the
fight
and
the
success
it
ended
with
of
the
prince
coming
though
it
seems
the
duke
did
give
way
again
and
again
the
king
did
give
order
for
care
to
be
had
of
daniel
and
his
companion
and
so
we
parted
from
him
and
then
met
the
duke
of
york
and
gave
him
the
same
account
and
so
broke
up
and
i
left
them
going
to
the
surgeon
to
the
crown
behind
the
and
there
supped
at
the
club
with
my
lord
brouncker
sir
ent
and
others
of
gresham
college
and
all
our
discourse
is
of
this
fight
at
sea
and
all
are
doubtful
of
the
success
and
conclude
all
had
been
lost
if
the
prince
had
not
come
in
they
having
chased
us
the
greatest
part
of
saturday
and
sunday
thence
with
my
lord
brouncker
and
creed
by
coach
to
white
hall
where
fresh
letters
are
come
from
harwich
where
the
gloucester
captain
clerke
is
come
in
and
says
that
on
sunday
night
upon
coming
in
of
the
prince
the
duke
did
fly
but
all
this
day
they
have
been
fighting
therefore
they
did
face
again
to
be
sure
captain
bacon
of
the
bristoll
is
killed
they
cry
up
jenings
of
the
ruby
and
saunders
of
the
sweepstakes
they
condemn
mightily
sir
thomas
teddiman
for
a
coward
but
with
what
reason
time
must
show
at
noon
though
i
should
have
dined
with
my
lord
mayor
and
aldermen
at
an
entertainment
of
commissioner
taylor
yet
it
being
a
time
of
expectation
of
the
success
of
the
fleet
i
did
not
go
no
manner
of
news
this
day
but
of
the
rainbow
being
put
in
from
the
fleet
maimed
as
the
other
ships
are
by
and
by
walking
a
little
further
sir
philip
frowde
secretary
to
the
duchess
of
york
did
meet
the
duke
with
an
express
to
sir
coventry
who
was
by
from
captain
taylor
the
storekeeper
at
harwich
being
the
narration
of
captain
hayward
of
the
dunkirke
who
gives
a
very
serious
account
how
upon
monday
the
two
fleets
fought
all
day
till
seven
at
night
and
then
the
whole
fleet
of
dutch
did
betake
themselves
to
a
very
plain
flight
and
never
looked
back
again
that
sir
christopher
mings
is
wounded
in
the
leg
that
the
generall
is
well
that
it
is
conceived
reasonably
that
of
all
the
dutch
fleet
which
with
what
recruits
they
had
come
to
one
hundred
sail
there
is
not
above
fifty
got
home
and
of
them
few
if
any
of
their
flags
and
that
little
captain
bell
in
one
of
the
did
at
the
end
of
the
day
fire
a
ship
of
guns
we
were
also
so
overtaken
with
this
good
news
that
the
duke
ran
with
it
to
the
king
who
was
gone
to
chapel
and
there
all
the
court
was
in
a
hubbub
being
rejoiced
over
head
and
ears
in
this
good
news
away
go
i
by
coach
to
the
new
exchange
and
there
did
spread
this
good
news
a
little
though
i
find
it
had
broke
out
before
and
so
home
to
our
own
church
it
being
the
common
and
it
was
just
before
sermon
but
lord
how
all
the
people
in
the
church
stared
upon
me
to
see
me
whisper
to
sir
john
minnes
and
my
lady
pen
anon
i
saw
people
stirring
and
whispering
below
and
by
and
by
comes
up
the
sexton
from
my
lady
ford
to
tell
me
the
news
which
i
had
brought
being
now
sent
into
the
church
by
sir
batten
in
writing
and
passed
from
pew
to
pew
but
that
which
pleased
me
as
much
as
the
news
was
to
have
the
fair
middleton
at
our
church
who
indeed
is
a
very
beautiful
lady
idled
away
the
whole
night
till
twelve
at
night
at
the
bonfire
in
the
streets
some
of
the
people
thereabouts
going
about
with
musquets
and
did
give
me
two
or
three
vollies
of
their
musquets
i
giving
them
a
crown
to
drink
and
so
home
mightily
pleased
with
this
happy
day
news
and
the
more
because
confirmed
by
sir
daniel
harvy
ranger
of
richmond
park
who
was
in
the
whole
fight
with
the
generall
and
tells
me
that
there
appear
but
in
all
of
the
dutch
fleet
left
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
when
they
run
home
the
joy
of
the
city
was
this
night
exceeding
great
up
betimes
and
to
my
office
about
business
sir
coventry
having
sent
me
word
that
he
is
gone
down
to
the
fleet
to
see
how
matters
stand
and
to
be
back
again
speedily
and
with
the
same
expectation
of
congratulating
ourselves
with
the
victory
that
i
had
yesterday
but
my
lord
brouncker
and
sir
probably
sir
thomas
harvey
that
come
from
court
tell
me
the
contrary
news
which
astonishes
me
that
is
to
say
that
we
are
beaten
lost
many
ships
and
good
commanders
have
not
taken
one
ship
of
the
enemy
and
so
can
only
report
ourselves
a
victory
nor
is
it
certain
that
we
were
left
masters
of
the
field
but
above
all
that
the
prince
run
on
shore
upon
the
galloper
and
there
stuck
was
endeavoured
to
be
fetched
off
by
the
dutch
but
could
not
and
so
they
burned
her
and
sir
ascue
is
taken
prisoner
and
carried
into
holland
this
news
do
much
trouble
me
and
the
thoughts
of
the
ill
consequences
of
it
and
the
pride
and
presumption
that
brought
us
to
it
at
noon
to
the
and
there
find
the
discourse
of
town
and
their
countenances
much
changed
but
yet
not
very
plain
by
and
by
comes
wayth
to
me
and
discoursing
of
our
ill
success
he
tells
me
plainly
from
captain
page
own
mouth
who
hath
lost
his
arm
in
the
fight
that
the
dutch
did
pursue
us
two
hours
before
they
left
us
and
then
they
suffered
us
to
go
on
homewards
and
they
retreated
towards
their
coast
which
is
very
sad
news
the
duke
much
damped
in
his
discourse
touching
the
late
fight
and
all
the
court
talk
sadly
of
it
the
duke
did
give
me
several
letters
he
had
received
from
the
fleet
and
sir
coventry
and
sir
pen
who
are
gone
down
thither
for
me
to
pick
out
some
works
to
be
done
for
the
setting
out
the
fleet
again
and
so
i
took
them
home
with
me
and
was
drawing
out
an
abstract
of
them
till
midnight
and
as
to
news
i
do
find
great
reason
to
think
that
we
are
beaten
in
every
respect
and
that
we
are
the
losers
the
prince
upon
the
galloper
where
both
the
royall
charles
and
royall
katharine
had
come
twice
aground
but
got
off
the
essex
carried
into
holland
the
swiftsure
missing
sir
barkeley
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
fight
captains
bacon
tearne
wood
mootham
whitty
and

slayne
the
duke
of
albemarle
writes
that
he
never
fought
with
worse
officers
in
his
life
not
above
twenty
of
them
behaving
themselves
like
men
sir
william
clerke
lost
his
leg
and
in
two
days
died
the
loyall
george
seven
oakes
and
swiftsure
are
still
missing
having
never
as
the
generall
writes
himself
engaged
with
them
it
was
as
great
an
alteration
to
find
myself
required
to
write
a
sad
letter
instead
of
a
triumphant
one
to
my
lady
sandwich
this
night
as
ever
on
any
occasion
i
had
in
my
life
to
my
very
great
joy
i
find
balty
come
home
without
any
hurt
after
the
utmost
imaginable
danger
he
hath
gone
through
in
the
henery
being
upon
the
with
harman
all
the
time
and
for
which
service
harman
i
heard
this
day
commended
most
seriously
and
most
eminently
by
the
duke
of
york
as
also
the
duke
did
do
most
utmost
right
to
sir
thomas
teddiman
of
whom
a
scandal
was
raised
but
without
cause
he
having
behaved
himself
most
eminently
brave
all
the
whole
fight
and
to
extraordinary
great
service
and
purpose
having
given
trump
himself
such
a
broadside
as
was
hardly
ever
given
to
any
ship
mings
is
shot
through
the
face
and
into
the
shoulder
where
the
bullet
is
lodged
young
holmes
is
also
and
atber
in
the
rupert
balty
tells
me
the
case
of
the
henery
and
it
was
indeed
most
extraordinary
sad
and
desperate
after
dinner
balty
and
i
to
my
office
and
there
talked
a
great
deal
of
this
fight
and
i
am
mightily
pleased
in
him
and
have
great
content
in
and
hopes
of
his
doing
well
thence
out
to
white
hall
to
a
committee
for
tangier
but
it
met
not
but
lord
to
see
how
melancholy
the
court
is
under
the
thoughts
of
this
last
overthrow
for
so
it
is
instead
of
a
victory
so
much
and
so
unreasonably
expected
we
hear
the
swiftsure
sir
barkeley
is
come
in
safe
to
the
nowre
after
her
being
absent
ever
since
the
beginning
of
the
fight
wherein
she
did
not
appear
at
all
from
beginning
to
end
the
court
is
divided
about
the
swiftsure
and
the
being
safe
and
wagers
and
odds
laid
on
both
sides
sir
coventry
is
come
to
town
so
i
to
his
chamber
but
i
do
not
hear
that
he
is
at
all
pleased
or
satisfied
with
the
late
fight
but
he
tells
me
more
news
of
our
suffering
by
the
death
of
one
or
two
captains
more
than
i
knew
before
but
he
do
give
over
the
thoughts
of
the
safety
of
the
swiftsure
or
essex
i
met
with
pierce
the
surgeon
who
is
lately
come
from
the
fleet
and
tells
me
that
all
the
commanders
officers
and
even
the
common
seamen
do
condemn
every
part
of
the
late
conduct
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
both
in
his
fighting
at
all
running
among
them
in
his
retreat
and
running
the
ships
on
ground
so
as
nothing
can
be
worse
spoken
of
that
holmes
spragg
and
smith
do
all
the
business
and
the
old
and
wiser
commanders
nothing
so
as
sir
thomas
teddiman
whom
the
king
and
all
the
world
speak
well
of
is
mightily
discontented
as
being
wholly
slighted
he
says
we
lost
more
after
the
prince
came
than
before
too
the
prince
was
so
maimed
as
to
be
forced
to
be
towed
home
he
says
all
the
fleet
confess
their
being
chased
home
by
the
dutch
and
yet
the
body
of
the
dutch
that
did
it
was
not
above
forty
sail
at
most
and
yet
this
put
us
into
the
fright
as
to
bring
all
our
ships
on
ground
he
says
however
that
the
duke
of
albemarle
is
as
high
almost
as
ever
and
pleases
himself
to
think
that
he
hath
given
the
dutch
their
bellies
full
without
sense
of
what
he
hath
lost
us
and
talks
how
he
knows
now
the
way
to
beat
them
but
he
says
that
even
smith
himself
one
of
his
creatures
did
himself
condemn
the
late
conduct
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
he
tells
me
further
how
the
duke
of
york
is
wholly
given
up
to
his
new
mistress
my
lady
denham
miss
brookes
a
relative
of
the
earl
of
bristol
married
to
sir
denham
frequently
mentioned
in
the
memoires
de
grammont
going
at
noonday
with
all
his
gentlemen
with
him
to
visit
her
in
scotland
yard
she
declaring
she
will
not
be
his
mistress
as
price
to
go
up
and
down
the
but
will
be
owned
publicly
and
so
she
is
brouncker
henry
brouncker
younger
brother
to
lord
brouncker
whom
he
succeeded
in
his
title
he
was
groom
of
the
to
the
duke
of
york
and
a
famous
it
seems
was
the
pimp
to
bring
it
about
and
my
lady
castlemaine
who
designs
thereby
to
fortify
herself
by
the
duke
there
being
a
the
other
day
between
the
king
and
her
on
this
occasion
the
queene
in
ordinary
talk
before
the
ladies
in
her
did
say
to
my
lady
castlemaine
that
she
feared
the
king
did
take
cold
by
staying
so
late
abroad
at
her
house
she
answered
before
them
all
that
he
did
not
stay
so
late
abroad
with
her
for
he
went
betimes
thence
though
he
do
not
before
one
two
or
three
in
the
morning
but
must
stay
somewhere
else
the
king
then
coming
in
and
overhearing
did
whisper
in
the
eare
aside
and
told
her
she
was
a
bold
impertinent
woman
and
bid
her
to
be
gone
out
of
the
court
and
not
to
come
again
till
he
sent
for
her
which
she
did
presently
and
went
to
a
lodging
in
the
pell
mell
and
kept
there
two
or
three
days
and
then
sent
to
the
king
to
know
whether
she
might
send
for
her
things
away
out
of
her
house
the
king
went
to
her
she
must
first
come
and
view
them
and
so
she
come
and
the
king
went
to
her
and
all
friends
again
he
tells
me
she
did
in
her
anger
say
she
would
be
even
with
the
king
and
print
his
letters
to
her
so
putting
all
together
we
are
and
are
like
to
be
in
a
sad
condition
we
are
endeavouring
to
raise
money
by
borrowing
it
of
the
city
but
i
do
not
think
the
city
will
lend
a
farthing
sir
carteret
and
i
walked
an
hour
in
the
under
henry
the
seventh
chapel
he
being
lately
come
from
the
fleet
and
tells
me
as
i
hear
from
every
body
else
that
the
management
in
the
late
fight
was
bad
from
top
to
bottom
that
several
said
that
this
would
not
have
been
if
my
lord
sandwich
had
had
the
ordering
of
it
nay
he
tells
me
that
certainly
had
my
lord
sandwich
had
the
misfortune
to
have
done
as
they
have
done
the
king
could
not
have
saved
him
there
is
too
nothing
but
discontent
among
the
officers
and
all
the
old
experienced
men
are
slighted
he
tells
me
to
my
question
but
as
a
great
secret
that
the
dividing
of
the
fleet
did
proceed
first
from
a
proposition
from
the
fleet
though
agreed
to
hence
but
he
confesses
it
arose
from
want
of
due
intelligence
he
do
however
call
the
fleet
retreat
on
sunday
a
very
honourable
one
and
that
the
duke
of
albemarle
did
do
well
in
it
and
would
have
been
well
if
he
had
done
it
sooner
rather
than
venture
the
loss
of
the
fleet
and
crown
as
he
must
have
done
if
the
prince
had
not
come
he
was
surprised
when
i
told
him
i
heard
that
the
king
did
intend
to
borrow
some
money
of
the
city
and
would
know
who
had
spoke
of
it
to
me
i
told
him
sir
ellis
layton
this
afternoon
he
says
it
is
a
dangerous
discourse
for
that
the
city
certainly
will
not
be
invited
to
do
it
and
then
for
the
king
to
ask
it
and
be
denied
will
be
the
beginning
of
our
sorrow
he
seems
to
fear
we
shall
all
fall
to
pieces
among
ourselves
this
evening
we
hear
that
sir
christopher
mings
is
dead
of
his
late
wounds
and
sir
coventry
did
commend
him
to
me
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
but
this
day
after
three
days
trial
in
vain
and
the
hazard
of
the
spoiling
of
the
ship
in
lying
till
next
spring
besides
the
disgrace
of
it
news
is
brought
that
the
loyall
london
is
launched
at
deptford
i
with
my
lady
pen
and
her
daughter
to
see
harman
whom
we
find
lame
in
bed
his
bones
of
his
ancle
are
broke
but
he
hopes
to
do
well
soon
and
a
fine
person
by
his
discourse
he
seems
to
be
and
he
did
plainly
tell
me
that
at
the
council
of
war
before
the
fight
it
was
against
his
reason
to
begin
the
fight
then
and
the
reasons
of
most
sober
men
there
the
wind
being
such
and
we
to
windward
that
they
could
not
use
their
lower
tier
of
guns
late
comes
sir
jo
bankes
to
see
me
who
tells
me
that
coming
up
from
rochester
he
overtook
three
or
four
hundred
seamen
and
he
believes
every
day
they
come
flocking
from
the
fleet
in
like
numbers
which
is
a
sad
neglect
there
when
it
will
be
impossible
to
get
others
and
we
have
little
reason
to
think
these
will
return
presently
again
walking
in
the
galleries
at
white
hall
i
find
the
ladies
of
honour
dressed
in
their
riding
garbs
with
coats
and
doublets
with
deep
skirts
just
for
all
the
world
like
mine
and
buttoned
their
doublets
up
the
breast
with
perriwigs
and
with
hats
so
that
only
for
a
long
petticoat
dragging
under
their
men
coats
nobody
could
take
them
for
women
in
any
point
whatever
which
was
an
odde
sight
and
a
sight
did
not
please
me
it
was
wells
and
another
fine
lady
that
i
saw
thus
sir
cholmly
sir
hugh
cholmely
of
whitby
yorkshire
was
employed
in
constructing
the
mole
at
tangier
and
resided
there
some
years
ob
tells
me
there
are
great
jarrs
between
the
duke
of
york
and
the
duke
of
albemarle
about
the
latter
turning
out
one
or
two
of
the
commanders
put
in
by
the
duke
of
york
among
others
captain
du
tell
a
frenchman
put
in
by
the
duke
of
york
and
mightily
defended
by
him
and
is
therein
led
by
monsieur
blancford
that
it
seems
hath
the
same
command
over
the
duke
of
york
as
sir
coventry
hath
which
raises
ill
blood
between
them
and
i
do
in
several
little
things
observe
that
sir
coventry
hath
of
late
by
the
by
reflected
on
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
his
captains
particularly
in
that
of
old
teddiman
who
did
deserve
to
be
turned
out
this
fight
and
was
so
but
i
heard
sir
coventry
say
that
the
duke
of
albemarle
put
in
one
as
bad
as
he
in
his
room
and
one
that
did
as
little
invited
to
sir
christopher
mings
funeral
but
find
them
gone
to
church
however
i
into
the
church
which
is
a
fair
large
church
and
a
great
chapel
and
there
heard
the
service
and
staid
till
they
buried
him
and
then
out
and
there
met
with
sir
coventry
who
was
there
out
of
great
generosity
and
no
person
of
quality
there
but
he
and
went
with
him
into
his
coach
and
being
in
it
with
him
there
happened
this
extraordinary
case
one
of
the
most
romantique
that
ever
i
heard
in
my
life
and
could
not
have
believed
but
that
i
did
see
it
which
was
this
about
a
dozen
able
lusty
proper
men
come
to
the
with
tears
in
their
eyes
and
one
of
them
that
spoke
for
the
rest
begun
and
said
to
sir
coventry
we
are
here
a
dozen
of
us
that
have
long
known
and
loved
and
served
our
dead
commander
sir
christopher
mings
and
have
now
done
the
last
office
of
laying
him
in
the
ground
we
would
be
glad
we
had
any
other
to
offer
after
him
and
in
revenge
of
him
all
we
have
is
our
lives
if
you
will
please
to
get
his
royal
highness
to
give
us
a
among
us
all
here
are
a
dozen
of
us
out
of
all
which
choose
you
one
to
be
commander
and
the
rest
of
us
whoever
he
is
will
serve
him
and
if
possible
do
that
which
shall
show
our
memory
of
our
dead
commander
and
our
revenge
sir
coventry
was
herewith
much
moved
as
well
as
i
who
could
hardly
abstain
from
weeping
and
took
their
names
and
so
parted
telling
me
that
he
would
move
his
royal
highness
as
in
a
thing
very
extraordinary
the
truth
is
sir
christopher
mings
was
a
very
stout
man
and
a
man
of
great
parts
and
most
excellent
tongue
among
ordinary
men
and
as
sir
coventry
says
could
have
been
the
most
useful
man
at
such
a
pinch
of
time
as
this
he
was
come
into
great
renowne
here
at
home
and
more
abroad
in
the
west
indys
he
had
brought
his
family
into
a
way
of
being
great
but
dying
at
this
time
his
memory
and
name
his
father
being
always
and
at
this
day
a
shoemaker
and
his
mother
a
hoyman
daughter
of
which
he
was
used
frequently
to
boast
will
be
quite
forgot
in
a
few
months
as
if
he
had
never
been
nor
any
of
his
name
be
the
better
by
it
he
having
not
had
time
to
will
any
estate
but
is
dead
poor
rather
than
rich
so
we
left
the
church
and
crowd
with
my
wife
and
father
to
hales
and
there
looked
only
on
my
father
picture
which
is
mighty
like
and
so
away
to
white
hall
to
a
committee
for
tangier
where
the
duke
of
york
was
and
sir
coventry
and
a
very
full
committee
and
instead
of
having
a
very
prejudiced
meeting
they
did
though
inclined
against
yeabsly
yield
to
the
greatest
part
of
his
account
so
as
to
allow
of
his
demands
to
the
value
of
and
more
and
only
give
time
for
him
to
make
good
his
pretence
to
the
rest
which
was
mighty
joy
to
me
and
so
we
rose
up
but
i
must
observe
the
force
of
money
which
did
make
my
lord
ashly
to
argue
and
behave
himself
in
the
business
with
the
greatest
friendship
and
yet
with
all
the
discretion
imaginable
and
it
will
be
a
business
of
admonition
and
instruction
to
me
concerning
him
and
other
men
too
for
aught
i
know
as
long
as
i
live
the
king
duke
of
york
and
sir
coventry
are
gone
down
to
the
fleet
it
seems
the
dutch
do
mightily
insult
of
their
victory
and
they
have
great
reason
sir
william
barkeley
was
killed
before
his
ship
taken
and
there
he
lies
dead
in
a
chest
for
every
body
to
see
with
his
flag
standing
up
by
him
and
sir
george
ascue
is
carried
up
and
down
the
hague
for
people
to
see
sir
coventry
is
returned
this
night
from
the
fleet
he
being
the
activest
man
in
the
world
and
we
all
myself
particularly
more
afraid
of
him
than
of
the
king
or
his
service
for
aught
i
see
god
forgive
us
this
day
the
great
news
is
come
of
the
french
their
taking
the
island
of
christopher
from
us
and
it
is
to
be
feared
they
have
done
the
like
of
all
those
islands
thereabouts
this
makes
me
mad
i
to
sir
carteret
by
appointment
where
i
perceive
by
him
the
king
is
going
to
borrow
some
money
of
the
city
but
i
fear
it
will
do
no
good
but
hurt
he
tells
me
how
the
generall
is
displeased
and
there
have
been
some
high
words
between
the
generall
and
sir
coventry
and
it
may
be
so
for
i
do
not
find
sir
coventry
so
highly
commending
the
duke
as
he
used
to
be
but
letting
fall
now
and
then
some
little
jerkes
as
this
day
speaking
of
news
from
holland
he
says
i
find
their
victory
begins
to
shrinke
there
as
well
as
ours
here
here
i
met
with
captain
cocke
and
he
tells
me
that
the
first
thing
the
prince
said
to
the
king
upon
his
coming
was
complaining
of
the
commissioners
of
the
navy
that
they
could
have
been
abroad
in
three
or
four
days
but
for
us
that
we
do
not
take
care
of
them
which
i
am
troubled
at
and
do
fear
may
in
violence
break
out
upon
this
office
some
time
or
other
for
we
shall
not
be
able
to
carry
on
the
business
up
and
at
the
office
all
the
morning
where
by
several
circumstances
i
find
sir
coventry
and
the
duke
of
albemarle
do
not
agree
as
they
used
to
do
sir
coventry
commending
aylett
in
some
reproach
to
the
duke
whom
the
duke
hath
put
out
for
want
of
courage
and
found
fault
with
steward
whom
the
duke
keeps
in
though
as
much
in
fault
as
any
commander
in
the
fleet
sir
george
smith
tells
me
that
this
day
my
lord
chancellor
and
some
of
the
court
have
been
with
the
city
and
that
the
city
have
voted
to
lend
the
king
which
if
soon
paid
as
he
says
he
believes
it
will
will
be
a
greater
service
than
i
did
ever
expect
at
this
time
from
the
city
reading
pompey
the
great
a
play
translated
from
the
french
by
several
noble
persons
among
others
my
lord
buckhurst
that
to
me
is
but
a
mean
play
and
the
words
and
sense
not
very
extraordinary
from
deptford
i
walked
to
redriffe
and
in
my
way
was
overtaken
by
bagwell
lately
come
from
sea
in
the
providence
who
did
give
me
an
account
of
several
particulars
in
the
late
fight
and
how
his
ship
was
deserted
basely
by
the
york
captain
swanly
commander
in
the
gallery
among
others
met
with
major
halsey
a
great
creature
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
who
tells
me
that
the
duke
by
name
hath
said
that
he
expected
to
have
the
work
here
up
in
the
river
done
having
left
sir
batten
and
phipps
there
he
says
that
the
duke
of
albemarle
do
say
that
this
is
a
victory
we
have
had
having
as
he
was
sure
killed
them
men
and
sunk
about
fourteen
of
their
ships
but
nothing
like
this
appears
true
he
lays
much
of
the
little
success
we
have
had
however
upon
the
fleet
being
divided
by
order
from
above
and
the
want
of
spirit
in
the
commanders
and
that
he
was
commanded
by
order
to
go
out
of
the
downes
to
the
gunfleete
and
in
the
way
meeting
the
dutch
fleet
what
should
he
do
should
he
not
fight
them
especially
having
beat
them
heretofore
at
as
great
disadvantage
he
tells
me
further
that
having
been
downe
with
the
duke
of
albemarle
he
finds
that
holmes
and
spragge
do
govern
most
business
of
the
navy
and
by
others
i
understand
that
sir
thomas
allen
is
offended
thereat
that
he
is
not
so
much
advised
with
as
he
ought
to
be
he
tells
me
also
as
he
says
of
his
own
knowledge
that
several
people
before
the
duke
went
out
did
offer
to
supply
the
king
with
provided
he
would
be
treasurer
of
it
to
see
it
laid
out
for
the
navy
which
he
refused
and
so
it
died
but
i
believe
none
of
this
this
day
i
saw
my
lady
falmouth
elizabeth
daughter
of
hervey
bagot
and
widow
of
charles
berkeley
earl
of
falmouth
married
secondly
charles
first
duke
of
dorset
she
had
been
maid
of
honour
to
the
duchess
of
york
with
whom
i
remember
now
i
have
dined
at
my
lord
barkeley
heretofore
a
pretty
woman
she
was
now
in
her
second
or
third
mourning
and
pleasant
in
her
looks
by
and
by
the
council
rises
and
sir
coventry
come
out
and
he
and
i
went
aside
and
discoursed
of
much
business
of
the
navy
and
afterwards
took
his
coach
and
to
he
and
i
alone
there
we
had
much
talk
first
he
stated
a
discourse
of
a
talk
he
hears
about
the
town
which
says
he
is
a
very
bad
one
and
fit
to
be
suppressed
if
we
knew
how
which
is
the
comparing
of
the
success
of
the
last
year
with
that
of
this
saying
that
that
was
good
and
that
bad
i
was
as
sparing
in
speaking
as
i
could
being
jealous
of
him
and
myself
also
but
wished
it
could
be
stopped
but
said
i
doubted
it
could
not
otherwise
than
by
the
fleet
being
abroad
again
and
so
finding
other
work
for
minds
and
discourse
then
to
discourse
of
himself
saying
that
he
heard
that
he
was
under
the
lash
of
people
discourse
about
the
prince
not
having
notice
of
the
dutch
being
out
and
for
him
to
come
back
again
nor
the
duke
of
albemarle
notice
that
the
prince
was
sent
for
back
again
to
which
he
told
me
very
particularly
how
careful
he
was
the
very
same
night
that
it
was
resolved
to
send
for
the
prince
back
to
cause
orders
to
be
writ
and
waked
the
duke
who
was
then
in
bed
to
sign
them
and
that
they
went
by
express
that
very
night
being
the
wednesday
night
before
the
fight
which
begun
on
the
friday
and
that
for
sending
them
by
the
post
express
and
not
by
gentlemen
on
purpose
he
made
a
sport
of
it
and
said
i
knew
of
none
to
send
it
with
but
would
at
least
have
lost
more
time
in
fitting
themselves
out
than
any
diligence
of
theirs
beyond
that
of
the
ordinary
post
would
have
recovered
i
told
him
that
this
was
not
so
much
the
towne
talk
as
the
reason
of
dividing
the
fleete
to
this
he
told
me
he
ought
not
to
say
much
but
did
assure
me
in
general
that
the
proposition
did
first
come
from
the
fleet
and
the
resolution
not
being
prosecuted
with
orders
so
soon
as
the
generall
thought
fit
the
generall
did
send
sir
edward
spragge
up
on
purpose
for
them
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
whole
business
which
was
not
done
with
the
full
consent
and
advice
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
but
he
did
adde
as
the
catholiques
call
le
secret
de
la
masse
that
sir
edward
spragge
who
had
even
in
sir
christopher
mings
time
put
in
to
be
the
great
favourite
of
the
prince
but
much
more
now
had
a
mind
to
be
the
great
man
with
him
and
to
that
end
had
a
mind
to
have
the
prince
at
a
distance
from
the
duke
of
albemarle
that
they
might
be
doing
something
alone
did
as
he
believed
put
on
this
business
of
dividing
the
fleet
and
that
thence
it
came
he
tells
me
as
to
the
business
of
intelligence
the
want
whereof
the
world
did
complain
much
of
that
for
that
it
was
not
his
business
and
as
he
was
therefore
to
have
no
share
in
the
blame
so
he
would
not
meddle
to
lay
it
any
where
else
that
de
ruyter
was
ordered
by
the
states
not
to
make
it
his
business
to
come
into
much
danger
but
to
preserve
himself
as
much
as
was
fit
out
of
harm
way
to
be
able
to
direct
the
fleet
he
do
i
perceive
with
some
violence
forbear
saying
any
thing
to
the
reproach
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
but
contrarily
speaks
much
of
his
courage
but
i
do
as
plainly
see
that
he
do
not
like
the
duke
of
albemarle
proceedings
but
contrarily
is
displeased
therewith
and
he
do
plainly
diminish
the
commanders
put
in
by
the
duke
and
do
lessen
the
miscarriages
of
any
that
have
been
removed
by
him
he
concurs
with
me
that
the
next
bout
will
be
a
fatal
one
to
one
side
or
other
because
if
we
be
beaten
we
shall
not
be
able
to
set
out
our
fleet
again
he
do
confess
with
me
that
the
hearts
of
our
seamen
are
much
saddened
and
for
that
reason
among
others
wishes
sir
christopher
mings
was
alive
who
might
inspire
courage
and
spirit
into
them
speaking
of
holmes
how
great
a
man
he
is
and
that
he
do
for
the
present
and
hath
done
all
the
voyage
kept
himself
in
good
order
and
within
bounds
but
says
he
a
cat
will
be
a
cat
still
and
some
time
or
other
out
his
humours
must
break
again
he
do
not
disowne
but
that
the
dividing
of
the
fleet
upon
the
presumptions
that
were
then
had
which
i
suppose
was
the
french
fleet
being
come
this
way
was
a
good
resolution
news
from
sir
coventry
that
the
dutch
are
certainly
come
out
mrs
pen
carried
us
to
two
gardens
at
hackny
which
i
every
day
grow
more
and
more
in
love
with
drake
one
where
the
garden
is
good
and
house
and
the
prospect
admirable
the
other
my
lord
brooke
robert
lord
brooke
ob
evelyn
mentions
this
garden
as
lady
brooke
brooke
house
at
clapton
was
lately
occupied
as
a
private
madhouse
where
the
gardens
are
much
better
but
the
house
not
so
good
nor
the
prospect
good
at
all
but
the
gardens
are
excellent
and
here
i
first
saw
oranges
grow
some
green
some
half
some
a
quarter
and
some
full
ripe
on
the
same
tree
and
one
fruit
of
the
same
tree
do
come
a
year
or
two
after
the
other
i
pulled
off
a
little
one
by
stealth
the
man
being
mightily
curious
of
them
and
eat
it
and
it
was
just
as
other
little
green
small
oranges
are
as
big
as
half
the
end
of
my
little
finger
here
were
also
great
variety
of
other
exotique
plants
and
several
labarinths
and
a
pretty
aviary
in
the
morning
come
chichly
afterwards
sir
thomas
chicheley
a
and
commissioner
of
the
ordnance
to
sir
coventry
to
tell
him
the
ill
success
of
the
guns
made
for
the
loyall
london
which
is
that
in
the
trial
every
one
of
the
great
guns
the
whole
cannon
of
seven
as
i
take
it
broke
in
pieces
to
sir
coventry
chamber
where
i
saw
his
father
my
lord
coventry
picture
hung
up
done
by
stone
who
then
brought
it
home
it
is
a
good
picture
drawn
in
his
judge
robes
and
the
great
seal
by
him
and
while
it
was
hanging
up
this
says
sir
coventry
merrily
is
the
use
we
make
of
our
fathers
but
what
i
observed
most
from
the
discourse
was
this
of
sir
coventry
that
he
do
look
upon
ourselves
in
a
desperate
condition
the
issue
of
all
standing
upon
this
one
point
that
by
the
next
fight
if
we
beat
the
dutch
will
certainly
be
content
to
take
eggs
for
their
money
that
was
his
expression
or
if
we
be
beaten
we
must
be
contented
to
make
peace
and
glad
if
we
can
have
it
without
paying
too
dear
for
it
and
withall
we
do
rely
wholly
upon
the
parliament
giving
us
more
money
the
next
sitting
or
else
we
are
undone
i
did
this
afternoon
visit
my
lord
bellasses
who
professes
all
imaginable
satisfaction
in
me
my
lord
is
going
down
to
his
garrison
to
hull
by
the
command
to
put
it
in
order
for
fear
of
an
invasion
which
course
i
perceive
is
taken
upon
the
round
for
we
have
a
real
apprehension
of
the
king
of
france
invading
us
the
dutch
are
now
known
to
be
out
and
we
may
expect
them
every
hour
upon
our
coast
but
our
fleet
is
in
pretty
good
readiness
for
them
to
the
office
where
i
met
with
a
letter
from
dover
which
tells
me
and
it
did
come
by
express
that
news
is
brought
over
by
a
gentleman
from
callice
that
the
dutch
fleet
sail
are
come
upon
the
french
coast
and
that
the
country
is
bringing
in
and
shovells
and
into
callice
that
there
are
men
armed
with
head
back
and
breast
frenchmen
ready
to
go
on
board
the
dutch
fleet
and
will
be
followed
by
more
that
they
pretend
they
are
to
come
to
dover
and
that
thereupon
the
governor
of
dover
castle
is
getting
the
victuallers
provision
out
of
the
town
into
the
castle
to
secure
it
but
i
do
think
this
is
a
ridiculous
conceit
but
a
little
time
will
show
mightily
troubled
all
this
morning
with
going
to
my
lord
mayor
sir
thomas
bludworth
a
silly
man
i
think
as
his
conduct
during
the
great
fire
fully
proved
and
other
places
about
getting
shipped
some
men
that
they
have
these
two
last
nights
pressed
in
the
city
out
of
houses
the
persons
wholly
unfit
for
sea
and
many
of
them
people
of
very
good
fashion
which
is
a
shame
to
think
of
and
carried
to
bridewell
they
are
yet
without
being
impressed
with
money
legally
as
they
ought
to
be
but
to
see
how
the
king
business
is
done
my
lord
mayor
himself
did
scruple
at
this
time
of
extremity
to
do
this
thing
because
he
had
not
money
to
pay
the
to
the
men
i
did
out
of
my
own
purse
disburse
to
pay
for
their
pressing
and
diet
last
night
and
this
morning
which
is
a
thing
worth
record
of
my
lord
mayor
busy
about
this
all
the
morning
and
about
the
getting
off
men
pressed
by
our
officers
of
the
fleet
into
the
service
even
our
own
men
that
are
at
the
office
and
the
boats
that
carry
us
so
that
it
is
now
become
impossible
to
have
so
much
as
a
letter
carried
from
place
to
place
or
any
message
done
for
us
nay
out
of
victualling
ships
full
loaden
to
go
down
to
the
fleet
and
out
of
the
vessels
of
the
officers
of
the
ordnance
they
press
men
so
that
for
want
of
discipline
in
this
respect
i
do
fear
all
will
be
undone
july
comes
sir
pen
to
town
which
i
little
expected
having
invited
my
lady
and
her
daughter
pegg
to
dine
with
me
day
which
at
noon
they
did
and
sir
pen
with
them
and
pretty
merry
we
were
and
though
i
do
not
love
him
yet
i
find
it
necessary
to
keep
in
with
him
his
good
service
at
shearnesse
in
getting
out
the
fleet
being
much
taken
notice
of
and
reported
to
the
king
and
duke
even
from
the
prince
and
duke
of
albemarle
themselves
and
made
the
most
of
to
me
and
them
by
sir
coventry
therefore
i
think
it
discretion
great
and
necessary
discretion
to
keep
in
with
him
to
the
tower
several
times
about
the
business
of
the
pressed
men
and
late
at
it
till
twelve
at
night
shipping
of
them
but
lord
how
some
poor
women
did
cry
and
in
my
life
i
never
did
see
such
natural
expression
of
passion
as
i
did
here
in
some
women
bewailing
themselves
and
running
to
every
parcel
of
men
that
were
brought
one
after
another
to
look
for
their
husbands
and
wept
over
every
vessel
that
went
off
thinking
they
might
be
there
and
looking
after
the
ship
as
far
as
ever
they
could
by
that
it
grieved
me
to
the
heart
to
hear
them
besides
to
see
poor
patient
labouring
men
and
housekeepers
leaving
poor
wives
and
families
taken
up
on
a
sudden
by
strangers
was
very
hard
and
that
without
but
forced
against
all
law
to
be
gone
it
is
a
great
tyranny
up
betimes
and
forced
to
go
to
my
lord
mayor
about
the
business
of
the
pressed
men
and
indeed
i
find
him
a
mean
man
of
understanding
and
dispatch
of
any
publick
business
thence
out
of
curiosity
to
bridewell
to
see
the
pressed
men
where
there
are
about
but
so
unruly
that
i
durst
not
go
among
them
and
they
have
reason
to
be
so
having
been
kept
these
three
days
prisoners
with
little
or
no
victuals
and
pressed
out
and
contrary
to
all
course
of
law
without
and
men
that
are
not
liable
to
it
were
i
met
with
prating
colonel
cox
one
of
the
city
collonells
heretofore
a
great
presbyter
but
to
hear
how
the
fellow
did
commend
himself
and
the
service
he
do
the
king
and
like
an
asse
at
paul
did
take
me
out
of
my
way
on
purpose
to
show
me
the
gate
the
little
north
gate
where
he
had
two
men
shot
close
by
him
on
each
time
and
his
own
hair
burnt
by
a
in
the
insurrection
of
venner
and
himself
escaped
i
found
one
of
the
vessels
loaden
with
the
bridewell
birds
in
a
great
mutiny
and
they
would
not
sail
not
they
but
with
good
words
and
cajoling
the
ringleader
into
the
tower
where
when
he
was
come
he
was
clapped
up
in
the
hole
they
were
got
very
quietly
but
i
think
it
is
much
if
they
do
not
run
the
vessel
on
ground
finch
one
of
the
commissioners
of
excise
and
i
fell
to
discourse
of
the
parliament
and
the
great
men
there
and
among
others
vaughan
whom
he
reports
as
a
man
of
excellent
judgement
and
learning
but
most
passionate
and
opiniastre
he
had
done
himself
the
most
wrong
though
he
values
it
not
that
is
the
displeasure
of
the
king
in
his
standing
so
long
against
the
breaking
of
the
act
for
a
triennial
parliament
but
yet
do
believe
him
to
be
a
most
loyall
gentleman
he
told
me
character
that
he
is
a
man
of
mighty
labour
and
reading
and
memory
but
the
worst
judge
of
matters
or
layer
together
of
what
he
hath
read
in
the
world
which
i
do
not
however
believe
him
in
that
he
believes
him
very
true
to
the
king
in
his
heart
but
can
never
be
reconciled
to
episcopacy
that
the
house
do
not
lay
much
weight
upon
him
or
any
thing
he
says
news
came
yesterday
from
harwich
that
the
dutch
had
appeared
upon
our
coast
with
their
fleet
and
we
believe
did
go
to
the
and
they
are
supposed
to
be
there
now
but
i
have
heard
nothing
of
them
yesterday
whistler
at
sir
pen
told
me
that
alexander
broome
alexander
broome
an
attorney
in
the
lord
mayor
court
author
of
loyal
songs
and
madrigals
much
sung
by
the
cavaliers
and
of
a
translation
of
horace
he
was
regretted
as
an
agreeable
companion
the
great
is
lately
dead
thanks
be
to
god
the
plague
is
as
i
hear
encreased
but
two
this
week
but
in
the
country
in
several
places
it
rages
mightily
and
particularly
in
colchester
where
it
hath
long
been
and
is
believed
will
quite
depopulate
the
place
with
the
duke
all
of
us
discoursing
about
the
places
where
to
build
ten
great
ships
the
king
and
council
have
resolved
on
none
to
be
under
but
it
is
impossible
to
do
it
unless
we
have
more
money
towards
the
doing
it
than
yet
we
have
in
any
view
but
however
the
show
must
be
made
to
the
world
in
the
evening
sir
pen
came
to
me
and
we
walked
together
and
talked
of
the
late
fight
i
find
him
very
plain
that
the
whole
conduct
of
the
late
fight
was
ill
that
of
the
commanders
of
the
whole
fleet
have
told
him
so
they
all
saying
that
they
durst
not
oppose
it
at
the
council
of
war
for
fear
of
being
called
cowards
though
it
was
wholly
against
their
judgement
to
fight
that
day
with
the
disproportion
of
force
and
then
we
not
being
able
to
use
one
gun
of
our
lower
tier
which
was
a
greater
disproportion
than
the
other
besides
we
might
very
well
have
staid
in
the
downs
without
fighting
or
any
where
else
till
the
prince
could
have
come
up
to
them
or
at
least
till
the
weather
was
fair
that
we
might
have
the
benefit
of
our
whole
force
in
the
ships
that
we
had
he
says
three
things
must
be
remedied
or
else
we
shall
be
undone
by
this
fleet
that
we
must
fight
in
a
line
whereas
we
fight
promiscuously
to
our
utter
and
demonstrable
ruine
the
dutch
fighting
otherwise
and
we
whenever
we
beat
them
we
must
not
desert
ships
of
our
own
in
distress
as
we
did
for
that
makes
a
captain
desperate
and
he
will
fling
away
his
ship
when
there
are
no
hopes
left
him
of
that
ships
when
they
are
a
little
shattered
must
not
take
the
liberty
to
come
in
of
themselves
but
refit
themselves
the
best
they
can
and
stay
out
many
of
our
ships
coming
in
with
very
small
disableness
he
told
me
that
our
very
commanders
nay
our
very
do
stand
in
need
of
exercising
among
themselves
and
discoursing
the
business
of
commanding
a
fleet
he
telling
me
that
even
one
of
our
in
the
fleet
did
not
know
which
tacke
lost
the
wind
or
kept
it
in
the
last
engagement
he
says
it
was
pure
dismaying
and
fear
that
made
them
all
run
upon
the
galloper
not
having
their
wits
about
them
and
that
it
was
a
miracle
they
were
not
all
lost
he
much
inveighs
upon
my
discoursing
of
sir
john
lawson
saying
heretofore
that
sixty
sail
would
do
as
much
as
one
hundred
and
says
that
he
was
a
man
of
no
counsel
at
all
but
had
got
the
confidence
to
say
as
the
gallants
did
and
did
propose
to
himself
to
make
himself
great
by
them
and
saying
as
they
did
but
was
no
man
of
judgement
in
his
business
but
hath
been
out
in
the
greatest
points
that
have
come
before
them
and
then
in
the
business
of
which
he
did
oppose
all
the
world
sees
now
the
use
of
them
for
shelter
of
men
he
did
talk
very
rationally
to
me
insomuch
that
i
took
more
pleasure
this
night
in
hearing
him
discourse
than
i
ever
did
in
my
life
in
any
thing
that
he
said
i
believe
not
less
than
one
thousand
people
in
the
streets
but
it
is
a
pretty
thing
to
observe
that
both
there
and
every
where
else
a
man
shall
see
many
women
of
mean
sort
in
the
streets
but
no
men
men
being
so
afraid
of
the
press
i
dined
with
sir
carteret
and
after
dinner
had
much
discourse
about
our
public
business
and
he
do
seem
to
fear
every
day
more
and
more
what
i
do
which
is
a
general
confusion
in
the
state
plainly
answering
me
to
the
question
who
is
it
that
the
weight
of
the
warr
depends
upon
that
it
is
only
sir
coventry
he
tells
me
too
the
duke
of
albemarle
is
dissatisfied
and
that
the
duchesse
do
curse
coventry
as
the
man
that
betrayed
her
husband
to
the
sea
though
i
believe
that
it
is
not
so
thence
to
and
received
and
carried
it
home
whereof
in
gold
this
i
do
for
security
sake
and
convenience
of
carriage
though
it
costs
me
above
the
change
of
it
at
per
peece
creed
tells
me
he
finds
all
things
mighty
dull
at
court
and
that
they
now
begin
to
lie
long
in
bed
it
being
as
we
suppose
not
seemly
for
them
to
be
found
playing
and
gaming
as
they
used
to
be
nor
that
their
minds
are
at
ease
enough
to
follow
those
sports
and
yet
not
knowing
how
to
employ
themselves
though
there
be
work
enough
for
their
thoughts
and
councils
and
pains
they
keep
long
in
bed
but
he
thinks
with
me
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
can
help
us
but
the
personal
looking
after
his
business
and
his
officers
and
that
with
that
we
may
yet
do
well
but
otherwise
must
be
undone
nobody
at
this
day
taking
care
of
anything
nor
hath
any
body
to
call
him
to
account
for
it
to
the
office
the
yard
being
very
full
of
women
i
believe
above
three
hundred
coming
to
get
money
for
their
husbands
and
friends
that
are
prisoners
in
holland
and
they
lay
clamouring
and
swearing
and
cursing
us
that
my
wife
and
i
were
afraid
to
send
a
that
we
have
for
supper
to
the
cook
to
be
baked
for
fear
of
their
offering
violence
to
it
but
it
went
and
no
hurt
done
to
the
tower
to
speak
with
sir
john
robinson
about
the
bad
condition
of
the
pressed
men
for
want
of
clothes
i
away
by
coach
to
james
and
there
hear
that
the
duchesse
is
lately
brought
to
bed
of
a
boy
by
and
by
called
to
wait
on
the
duke
the
king
being
present
and
there
agreed
among
other
things
of
the
places
to
build
the
ten
new
great
ships
ordered
to
be
built
and
as
to
the
relief
of
prisoners
is
holland
and
then
about
several
stories
of
the
basenesse
of
the
king
of
spain
being
served
with
officers
they
in
flanders
having
as
good
common
men
as
any
prince
in
the
world
but
the
veriest
cowards
for
the
officers
nay
for
the
general
officers
as
the
generall
and
in
the
whole
world
but
above
all
things
the
king
did
speak
most
in
contempt
of
the
ceremoniousnesse
of
the
king
of
spain
that
he
do
nothing
but
under
some
ridiculous
form
or
other
i
shall
get
in
near
into
my
own
hands
which
is
in
the
king
upon
tallies
which
will
be
a
pleasure
to
me
and
satisfaction
to
have
a
good
sum
in
my
own
hands
whatever
evil
disturbances
should
be
in
the
state
though
it
troubles
me
to
lose
so
great
a
profit
as
the
interest
of
ten
per
cent
for
that
money
with
sir
coventry
into
london
to
the
office
and
all
the
way
i
observed
him
mightily
to
make
mirth
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
his
people
about
him
saying
that
he
was
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
for
doing
of
great
things
by
sorry
instruments
and
so
particularized
in
sir
clerke
and
riggs
and
halsey
and
others
and
then
again
said
that
the
only
duality
eminent
in
him
was
that
he
did
persevere
and
indeed
he
is
a
very
drudge
and
stands
by
the
king
business
up
betimes
to
the
office
to
write
fair
a
laborious
letter
i
wrote
as
from
the
board
to
the
duke
of
york
laying
out
our
want
of
money
again
and
particularly
the
business
of
captain
cocke
tender
of
hemp
which
my
lord
brouncker
brought
in
under
an
unknown
hand
without
name
wherein
his
lordship
will
have
no
great
success
i
doubt
that
being
done
i
down
to
streete
and
there
agreed
for
four
or
five
tons
of
corke
to
send
this
day
to
the
fleet
being
a
new
device
to
make
barricados
with
instead
of
junke
after
a
song
in
the
garden
which
is
now
the
greatest
pleasure
i
take
and
indeed
do
please
me
mightily
to
bed
this
evening
i
had
davila
brought
home
to
me
and
find
it
a
most
excellent
history
as
ever
i
read
a
wonderful
dark
sky
and
shower
of
rain
this
morning
at
harwich
a
shower
of
hail
as
big
as
walnuts
to
james
after
my
fellows
and
here
among
other
things
before
us
all
the
duke
of
york
did
say
that
now
at
length
is
come
to
a
sure
knowledge
that
the
dutch
did
lose
in
the
late
engagements
captains
and
thirteen
ships
upon
which
sir
coventry
did
publickly
move
that
if
his
royal
highness
had
this
of
a
certainty
it
would
be
of
use
to
send
this
down
to
the
fleet
and
to
cause
it
to
be
spread
about
the
fleet
for
the
recovering
of
the
spirits
of
the
officers
and
seamen
who
are
under
great
dejectednes
for
want
of
knowing
that
they
did
do
any
thing
against
the
enemy
notwithstanding
all
that
they
did
to
us
which
though
it
be
true
yet
methought
was
one
of
the
most
dishonourable
motions
to
our
countrymen
that
ever
was
made
and
is
worth
remembering
thence
with
sir
pen
home
calling
at
lilly
to
have
a
time
appointed
when
to
be
drawn
among
the
other
commanders
of
flags
the
last
year
fight
and
so
full
of
work
lilly
is
that
he
was
fain
to
take
his
out
to
see
how
his
time
is
appointed
and
appointed
six
days
hence
for
him
to
come
between
seven
and
eight
in
the
morning
thence
with
him
home
and
there
by
appointment
i
find
fuller
now
bishop
of
limericke
in
ireland
whom
i
knew
in
his
low
condition
at
twittenham
and
find
the
bishop
the
same
good
man
that
ever
and
in
a
word
kind
to
us
and
methinks
one
of
the
comeliest
and
most
becoming
prelates
in
all
respects
that
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
during
dinner
comes
an
acquaintance
of
his
sir
thomas
littleton
afterwards
made
treasurer
of
the
navy
in
conjunction
with
sir
thomas
osborn
whom
i
knew
not
while
he
was
in
my
house
but
liked
his
discourse
and
afterwards
by
sir
pen
do
come
to
know
that
he
is
one
of
the
greatest
speakers
in
the
house
of
commons
and
the
usual
second
to
the
great
vaughan
so
was
sorry
i
did
observe
him
no
more
and
gain
more
of
his
acquaintance
walked
to
woolwich
reading
the
rivall
ladys
a
by
dryden
all
the
way
and
find
it
a
most
pleasant
and
fine
writ
play
full
of
wants
of
money
and
much
stores
to
buy
for
to
replenish
the
stores
and
no
money
to
do
it
with
the
fleet
is
sailed
this
morning
god
send
us
good
news
of
them
at
noon
walked
in
the
garden
with
commissioner
pett
newly
come
to
town
who
tells
me
how
infinite
the
disorders
are
among
the
commanders
and
all
officers
of
the
fleet
no
discipline
nothing
but
swearing
and
cursing
and
every
body
doing
what
they
please
and
the
generalls
understanding
no
better
suffer
it
to
the
reproaching
of
this
board
or
whoever
it
will
be
he
himself
hath
been
challenged
twice
to
the
field
or
something
as
good
by
sir
edward
spragge
and
capt
seamons
query
seymour
he
tells
me
that
captains
carry
for
all
the
late
orders
what
men
they
please
so
that
he
fears
and
i
do
no
less
that
god
almighty
can
bless
us
while
we
keep
in
this
disorder
that
we
are
in
he
observing
to
me
too
that
there
is
no
man
of
counsel
or
advice
in
the
fleet
and
the
truth
is
that
the
gentlemen
captains
will
undo
us
for
they
are
not
to
be
kept
in
order
their
friends
about
the
king
and
duke
and
their
own
houses
are
so
free
that
it
is
not
for
any
person
but
the
duke
himself
to
have
any
command
over
them
walked
to
white
hall
where
saw
nobody
almost
but
walked
up
and
down
with
hugh
may
an
architect
and
comptroller
of
the
works
at
windsor
castle
ob
who
is
a
very
ingenious
man
among
other
things
discoursing
of
the
present
fashion
of
gardens
to
make
them
plain
that
we
have
the
best
walks
of
gravell
in
the
world
france
having
none
nor
italy
and
our
green
of
our
bowling
allies
is
better
than
any
they
have
so
our
business
here
being
ayre
this
is
the
best
way
only
with
a
little
mixture
of
statues
or
pots
which
may
be
handsome
and
so
filled
with
another
pot
of
such
or
such
a
flower
or
greene
as
the
season
of
the
year
will
bear
and
then
for
flowers
they
are
best
seen
in
a
little
plat
by
themselves
besides
their
borders
spoil
the
walks
of
another
garden
and
then
for
fruit
the
best
way
is
to
have
walls
built
circularly
one
within
another
to
the
south
on
purpose
for
fruit
and
leave
the
walking
garden
only
for
that
use
sir
richard
fanshaw
is
lately
dead
at
madrid
the
fleet
can
not
get
clear
of
the
river
but
expect
the
first
wind
to
be
out
and
then
to
be
sure
to
fight
the
queene
and
maids
of
honour
are
at
tunbridge
all
full
of
expectation
of
the
fleet
engagement
but
it
is
not
yet
sir
coventry
says
they
are
war
but
one
and
that
the
sweepstakes
which
carries
forty
guns
they
are
most
infinitely
manned
he
tells
me
the
loyal
london
sir
smith
which
by
the
way
he
commends
to
be
the
best
ship
in
the
world
large
and
small
hath
above
eight
hundred
men
and
moreover
takes
notice
which
is
worth
notice
that
the
fleet
hath
lain
now
near
fourteen
days
without
any
demand
for
a
of
any
thing
of
any
kind
but
only
to
get
men
he
also
observes
that
with
this
excess
of
men
nevertheless
they
have
thought
fit
to
leave
behind
them
sixteen
ships
which
they
have
robbed
of
their
men
which
certainly
might
have
been
manned
and
they
have
been
serviceable
in
the
fight
and
yet
the
fleet
according
to
the
excess
of
supernumeraries
which
we
hear
they
have
at
least
two
or
three
of
them
might
have
been
left
manned
and
sent
away
with
the
gottenburgh
ships
they
conclude
this
to
be
much
the
best
fleet
for
force
of
guns
greatness
and
number
of
ships
and
men
that
ever
england
did
see
being
as
sir
coventry
reckons
besides
those
left
behind
and
ships
though
we
can
not
hear
that
they
have
with
them
above
eighteen
the
french
are
not
yet
joined
with
the
dutch
which
do
dissatisfy
the
hollanders
and
if
they
should
have
a
defeat
will
undo
de
witt
the
people
generally
of
holland
do
hate
this
league
with
france
at
white
hall
we
find
the
court
gone
to
chapel
it
being
and
by
and
by
while
they
are
at
chapel
and
we
waiting
chapel
being
done
come
people
out
of
the
park
telling
us
that
the
guns
are
heard
plainly
and
so
every
body
to
the
park
and
by
and
by
the
chapel
done
and
the
king
and
duke
into
the
bowling
green
and
upon
the
leads
whither
i
went
and
there
the
guns
were
plain
to
be
heard
though
it
was
pretty
to
hear
how
confident
some
would
be
in
the
lowdnesse
of
the
guns
which
it
was
as
much
as
ever
i
could
do
to
hear
them
by
and
by
the
king
to
dinner
and
i
waited
there
his
dining
but
lord
how
little
i
should
be
pleased
i
think
to
have
so
many
people
crowding
about
me
and
among
other
things
it
astonished
me
to
see
my
lord
barkeshire
thomas
howard
second
son
of
thomas
first
earl
of
suffolk
created
earl
of
berkshire
ob
aged
nearly
waiting
at
table
and
serving
the
king
drink
in
that
dirty
pickle
as
i
never
saw
man
in
my
life
here
i
met
williams
who
would
have
me
to
dine
where
he
was
invited
to
dine
at
the
so
after
the
king
meat
was
taken
away
we
thither
but
he
could
not
stay
but
left
me
there
among
two
or
three
of
the
king
servants
where
we
dined
with
the
meat
that
come
from
his
table
which
was
most
excellent
with
most
brave
drink
cooled
in
ice
which
at
this
hot
time
was
welcome
and
i
drinking
no
wine
had
metheglin
for
the
king
own
drinking
which
did
please
me
mightily
to
sir
coventry
lodging
and
there
he
showed
me
captain
talbot
letter
wherein
he
says
that
the
fight
begun
on
the
that
our
white
squadron
begun
with
one
of
the
dutch
squadrons
and
then
the
red
with
another
so
hot
that
we
put
them
both
to
giving
way
and
so
they
continued
in
pursuit
all
the
day
and
as
long
as
he
stayed
with
them
that
the
blow
fell
to
the
zealand
squadron
and
after
a
long
dispute
he
against
two
or
three
great
ships
received
eight
or
nine
dangerous
shots
and
so
come
away
and
says
he
saw
the
resolution
burned
by
one
of
their
and
four
or
five
of
the
enemy
but
says
that
two
or
three
of
our
great
ships
were
in
danger
of
being
fired
by
our
which
sir
coventry
nor
i
can
not
understand
but
upon
the
whole
he
and
i
walked
two
or
three
turns
in
the
park
under
the
great
trees
and
no
doubt
that
this
gallant
is
come
away
a
little
too
soon
having
lost
never
a
mast
nor
sail
and
then
we
did
begin
to
discourse
of
the
young
genteel
captains
which
he
was
very
free
with
me
in
speaking
his
mind
of
the
unruliness
of
them
and
what
a
loss
the
king
hath
of
his
old
men
and
now
of
this
hannam
of
the
resolution
if
he
be
dead
he
told
me
how
he
is
disturbed
to
hear
the
commanders
at
sea
called
cowards
here
on
shore
to
my
lord
lauderdale
where
we
find
some
scotch
people
at
supper
pretty
odd
company
though
my
lord
brouncker
tells
me
my
lord
lauderdale
is
a
man
of
mighty
good
reason
and
judgement
but
at
supper
there
played
one
of
their
servants
upon
the
viallin
some
scotch
tunes
only
several
and
the
best
of
their
country
as
they
seemed
to
esteem
them
by
their
praising
and
admiring
them
but
lord
the
strangest
ayre
that
ever
i
heard
in
my
life
and
all
of
one
cast
but
strange
to
hear
my
lord
lauderdale
say
himself
that
he
had
rather
hear
a
cat
mew
than
the
best
musique
in
the
world
and
the
better
the
musique
the
more
sick
it
makes
him
and
that
of
all
instruments
he
hates
the
lute
most
and
next
to
that
the
baggpipe
all
the
town
is
full
of
a
victory
by
and
by
a
letter
from
sir
coventry
tells
me
that
we
have
the
victory
beat
them
into
the
weelings
had
taken
two
of
their
great
ships
but
by
the
orders
of
the
generalls
they
are
burned
this
being
methought
but
a
poor
result
after
the
fighting
of
two
so
great
fleets
and
four
days
having
no
tidings
of
them
i
was
still
impatient
but
could
know
no
more
i
to
sir
batten
where
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
was
and
sir
john
minnes
and
the
news
i
find
is
what
i
had
heard
before
only
that
our
blue
squadron
it
seems
was
pursued
the
most
of
the
time
having
more
ships
a
great
many
than
its
number
allotted
to
its
share
young
seamour
is
killed
the
only
captain
slain
the
resolution
burned
but
as
they
say
most
of
her
crew
and
commander
saved
this
is
all
only
we
keep
the
sea
which
denotes
a
victory
or
at
least
that
we
are
not
beaten
but
no
great
matters
to
brag
of
god
knows
to
sir
coventry
at
james
where
i
find
him
in
his
new
closet
which
is
very
fine
and
well
supplied
with
handsome
books
i
find
him
speak
very
slightly
of
the
late
victory
dislikes
their
staying
with
the
fleet
up
their
coast
believing
that
the
dutch
will
come
out
in
fourteen
days
and
then
we
with
our
unready
fleet
by
reason
of
some
of
the
ships
being
maymed
shall
be
in
bad
condition
to
fight
them
upon
their
own
coast
is
much
dissatisfied
with
the
great
number
of
men
and
their
fresh
demands
of
victualling
ships
they
going
out
the
other
day
as
full
as
they
could
stow
he
spoke
slightly
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
saying
when
de
ruyter
come
to
give
him
a
broadside
now
says
he
chewing
of
tobacco
the
while
will
this
fellow
come
and
give
me
two
broadsides
and
then
he
shall
run
but
it
seems
he
held
him
to
it
two
hours
till
the
duke
himself
was
forced
to
retreat
to
refit
and
was
towed
off
and
de
ruyter
staid
for
him
till
he
come
back
again
to
fight
one
in
the
ship
saying
to
the
duke
sir
methinks
de
ruyter
hath
given
us
more
than
two
broadsides
well
says
the
duke
but
you
shall
find
him
run
by
and
by
and
so
he
did
says
sir
coventry
but
after
the
duke
himself
had
been
first
made
to
fall
off
the
resolution
had
all
brass
guns
being
the
same
that
sir
lawson
had
in
her
in
the
straights
it
is
observed
that
the
two
fleets
were
even
in
number
to
one
ship
thence
home
and
to
sing
with
my
wife
and
mercer
pepys
maid
in
the
garden
and
coming
in
i
find
my
wife
plainly
dissatisfied
with
me
that
i
can
spend
so
much
time
with
mercer
teaching
her
to
sing
and
could
never
take
the
pains
with
her
which
i
acknowledge
but
it
is
because
that
the
girl
do
take
musick
mighty
readily
and
she
do
not
and
musick
is
the
thing
of
the
world
that
i
love
most
and
all
the
pleasure
almost
that
i
can
now
take
so
to
bed
in
some
little
discontent
but
no
words
from
me
the
court
empty
the
king
being
gone
to
tunbridge
and
the
duke
of
york
i
had
some
discourse
with
povy
who
is
mightily
discontented
i
find
about
his
disappointments
at
court
and
says
of
all
places
if
there
be
hell
it
is
here
no
faith
no
truth
no
love
nor
any
agreement
between
man
and
wife
nor
friends
he
would
have
spoke
broader
but
i
put
it
off
to
another
time
and
so
parted
povy
discoursed
with
me
about
my
lord
peterborough
which
his
man
did
give
me
from
him
the
last
year
salary
i
paid
him
which
he
would
have
povy
pay
him
again
but
i
have
not
taken
it
to
myself
yet
and
therefore
will
most
heartily
return
him
and
mark
him
put
for
a
coxcomb
povy
went
down
to
williamson
and
brought
me
up
this
extract
out
of
the
flanders
letters
to
day
come
that
admiral
everson
and
the
admiral
and
of
freezeland
with
many
captains
and
men
are
slain
that
de
ruyter
is
safe
but
lost
men
out
of
his
own
ship
but
that
he
is
in
great
disgrace
and
trump
in
better
favour
that
bankert
ship
is
burned
himself
hardly
escaping
with
a
few
men
on
board
de
haes
that
fifteen
captains
are
to
be
tried
the
seventh
of
august
and
that
the
hangman
was
sent
from
flushing
to
assist
the
council
of
warr
how
much
of
this
is
true
time
will
show
august
walked
over
the
park
with
sir
coventry
who
i
clearly
see
is
not
thoroughly
pleased
with
the
late
management
of
the
fight
nor
with
any
thing
that
the
generalls
do
only
is
glad
to
hear
that
de
ruyter
is
out
of
favour
and
that
this
fight
hath
cost
them
men
as
they
themselves
do
report
and
it
is
a
strange
thing
as
he
observes
how
now
and
then
the
slaughter
runs
on
one
hand
there
being
killed
on
theirs
and
not
above
or
killed
and
wounded
on
ours
and
as
many
officers
on
theirs
as
ordinary
captains
in
ours
the
death
of
everson
and
the
report
of
our
success
beyond
expectation
in
the
killing
of
so
great
a
number
of
men
hath
raised
the
estimation
of
the
late
victory
considerably
but
it
is
only
among
fools
for
all
that
was
but
accidental
but
this
morning
getting
sir
pen
to
read
over
the
narrative
with
me
he
did
sparingly
yet
plainly
say
that
we
might
have
intercepted
their
zealand
squadron
coming
home
if
we
had
done
our
parts
and
more
that
we
might
have
run
before
the
wind
as
well
as
they
and
have
overtaken
their
ships
in
the
pursuite
in
all
the
while
this
evening
sir
pen
come
into
the
garden
and
walked
with
me
and
told
me
that
he
had
certain
notice
that
at
flushing
they
are
in
great
distraction
de
ruyter
dares
not
come
on
shore
for
fear
of
the
people
nor
any
body
open
their
houses
or
shops
for
fear
of
the
tumult
which
is
a
very
good
hearing
in
met
with
battersby
says
he
do
you
see
dan
rawlinson
door
shut
up
which
i
did
and
wondered
why
says
he
after
all
this
sickness
and
himself
spending
all
the
last
year
in
the
country
one
of
his
men
is
now
dead
of
the
plague
and
his
wife
and
one
of
his
maids
sick
and
himself
shut
up
which
troubles
me
mightily
so
home
and
there
do
hear
also
from
sarah
daniel
that
greenwich
is
at
this
time
much
worse
than
ever
it
was
and
deptford
too
and
she
told
us
that
they
believed
all
the
town
would
leave
the
town
and
come
to
london
which
is
now
the
receptacle
of
all
the
people
from
all
infected
places
god
preserve
us
i
receive
fresh
intelligence
that
deptford
and
greenwich
are
now
afresh
exceedingly
afflicted
with
the
sickness
more
than
ever
discoursed
with
hooke
about
the
nature
of
sounds
and
he
did
make
me
understand
the
nature
of
musicall
sounds
made
by
strings
mighty
prettily
and
told
me
that
having
come
to
a
certain
number
of
vibrations
proper
to
make
any
tone
he
is
able
to
tell
how
many
strokes
a
fly
makes
with
her
wings
those
flies
that
hum
in
their
flying
by
the
note
that
it
answers
to
in
musique
during
their
flying
that
i
suppose
is
a
little
too
much
refined
but
his
discourse
in
general
of
sound
was
mighty
fine
to
james
where
we
attended
with
the
rest
of
my
fellows
on
the
duke
whom
i
found
with
two
or
three
patches
upon
his
nose
and
about
his
right
eye
which
came
from
his
being
struck
with
the
bough
of
a
tree
the
other
day
in
his
hunting
and
it
is
a
wonder
it
did
not
strike
out
his
eye
to
bow
to
my
lady
pooly
wife
of
sir
edmund
pooly
mentioned
before
where
my
wife
was
with
batelier
and
his
sisters
and
there
i
found
a
noble
supper
about
ten
we
rose
from
table
and
sang
a
song
and
so
home
in
two
coaches
batelier
and
his
sister
mary
and
my
wife
and
i
in
one
and
mercer
alone
in
the
other
and
after
being
examined
at
allgate
whether
we
were
husbands
and
wives
home
so
to
bed
mighty
sleepy
but
with
much
pleasure
reeves
lying
at
my
house
and
mighty
proud
i
am
and
ought
to
be
thankful
to
god
almighty
that
i
am
able
to
have
a
spare
bed
for
my
friends
in
the
evening
to
about
money
to
enable
me
to
pay
sir
carteret
which
he
hath
lodged
in
my
hands
in
behalf
of
his
son
and
my
lady
jemimah
towards
their
portion
rawlinson
is
dead
of
the
sickness
and
her
maid
continues
mighty
ill
he
himself
is
got
out
of
the
house
i
met
with
evelyn
in
the
street
who
tells
me
the
sad
condition
at
this
very
day
at
deptford
for
the
plague
and
more
at
deale
within
his
precinct
as
one
of
the
commissioners
for
sick
and
wounded
seamen
that
the
towne
is
almost
quite
depopulated
homeward
and
hear
in
that
now
the
maid
also
is
dead
at
rawlinson
so
that
there
are
three
dead
in
all
the
wife
a
and
povy
tells
me
how
mad
my
letter
makes
my
lord
peterborough
and
what
a
furious
letter
he
writ
to
me
in
answer
though
it
is
not
come
yet
this
did
trouble
me
for
though
there
be
no
reason
yet
to
have
a
nobleman
mouth
open
against
a
man
may
do
a
man
hurt
so
i
endeavoured
to
have
found
him
out
and
spoke
with
him
but
could
not
after
dinner
with
my
wife
and
mercer
to
the
where
i
have
not
been
i
think
of
many
years
and
saw
some
good
sport
of
the
bull
tossing
of
the
dogs
one
into
the
very
boxes
but
it
is
a
very
rude
and
nasty
pleasure
we
had
a
great
many
hectors
in
the
same
box
with
us
and
one
very
fine
went
into
the
pit
and
played
his
dog
for
a
wager
which
was
a
strange
sport
for
a
gentleman
where
they
drank
wine
and
drank
mercer
health
first
which
i
pledged
with
my
hat
off
we
supped
at
home
and
very
merry
and
then
about
nine
to
mercer
gate
where
the
fire
and
boys
expected
us
and

mighty
merry
smutting

and
soot
till

then
we
broke

and
to
my
house
and
there

and
then

into

and
dressing

and

and
one
banister
who
with
my
wife

and
mighty
mirth
we
had
and
mercer
danced
a
jigg
and
nan
wright
and
my
wife
and
pegg
pen
put
on
perriwigs
thus
we
spent
till
three
or
four
in
the
morning
mighty
merry
and
then
parted
and
to
bed
mighty
sleepy
slept
till
past
eight
of
the
clock
and
was
called
up
by
a
letter
from
sir
coventry
which
among
other
things
tells
me
how
we
have
burned
one
hundred
and
sixty
ships
of
the
enemy
within
the
fly
i
up
and
with
all
possible
haste
and
in
pain
for
fear
of
coming
late
it
being
our
day
of
attending
the
duke
of
york
to
james
where
they
are
full
of
the
particulars
how
they
are
generally
good
some
of
them
laden
and
supposed
rich
ships
we
spent
five
ships
upon
them
we
landed
on
the
schelling
sir
philip
howard
with
some
men
and
holmes
i
think
with
others
about
in
all
and
burned
a
town
and
so
come
away
by
and
by
the
duke
of
york
with
his
books
showed
us
the
very
place
and
manner
and
that
it
was
not
our
design
and
expectation
to
have
done
this
but
only
to
have
landed
on
the
fly
and
burned
some
of
their
stores
but
being
come
in
we
spied
those
ships
and
with
our
long
boats
one
by
one
fired
them
our
ships
running
all
it
being
so
shoal
water
we
were
led
to
this
by
it
seems
a
renegado
captain
of
the
hollanders
who
found
himself
ill
used
by
de
ruyter
for
his
good
service
and
so
come
over
to
us
and
hath
done
us
good
service
so
that
now
we
trust
him
and
he
himself
did
go
on
this
expedition
the
service
is
very
great
and
our
joys
as
great
for
it
all
this
will
make
the
duke
of
albemarle
in
repute
again
i
doubt
the
guns
of
the
tower
going
off
and
bonfires
also
in
the
street
for
this
late
good
successe
this
day
sir
batten
did
show
us
at
the
table
a
letter
from
sir
allen
which
says
that
we
have
taken
ten
or
twelve
ships
since
the
late
great
expedition
of
burning
their
ships
and
town
laden
with
hemp
flax
tar
deals
this
was
good
news
but
by
and
by
comes
in
sir
carteret
and
he
asked
us
with
full
mouth
what
we
would
give
for
good
news
says
sir
batten
i
have
better
than
you
for
a
wager
they
laid
sixpence
and
we
that
were
by
were
to
give
sixpence
to
him
that
told
the
best
news
so
sir
batten
told
his
of
the
ten
or
twelve
ships
sir
carteret
did
then
tell
us
that
upon
the
news
of
the
burning
of
the
ships
and
town
the
common
people
of
amsterdam
did
besiege
de
witt
house
and
he
was
forced
to
flee
to
the
prince
of
orange
who
is
gone
to
cleve
to
the
marriage
of
his
sister
this
we
concluded
all
the
best
news
and
my
lord
brouncker
and
myself
did
give
sir
carteret
our
sixpence
which
he
did
give
smith
to
give
the
poor
thus
we
made
ourselves
mighty
merry
with
captain
erwin
discoursing
about
the
east
indys
where
he
hath
often
been
and
among
other
things
he
tells
me
how
the
king
of
syam
seldom
goes
out
without
thirty
or
forty
thousand
people
with
him
and
not
a
word
spoke
nor
a
hum
or
cough
in
the
whole
company
to
be
heard
he
tells
me
the
punishment
frequently
there
for
malefactors
is
cutting
off
the
crowns
of
their
head
which
they
do
very
dexterously
leaving
their
brains
bare
which
kills
them
presently
he
told
me
what
i
remember
he
hath
once
done
heretofore
that
every
body
is
to
lie
flat
down
at
the
coming
by
of
the
king
and
nobody
to
look
upon
him
upon
pain
of
death
and
that
he
and
his
fellows
being
strangers
were
invited
to
see
the
sport
of
taking
of
a
wild
elephant
and
they
did
only
kneel
and
look
towards
the
king
their
druggerman
dragoman
did
desire
them
to
fall
down
for
otherwise
he
should
suffer
for
their
contempt
of
the
king
the
sport
being
ended
a
messenger
comes
from
the
king
which
the
druggerman
thought
had
been
to
have
taken
away
his
life
but
it
was
to
enquire
how
the
strangers
liked
the
sport
the
druggerman
answered
that
they
did
cry
it
up
to
be
the
best
that
ever
they
saw
and
that
they
never
heard
of
any
prince
so
great
in
every
thing
as
this
king
the
messenger
being
gone
back
erwin
and
his
company
asked
their
druggerman
what
he
had
said
which
he
told
them
but
why
say
they
would
you
say
that
without
our
leave
it
being
not
true
it
makes
no
matter
for
that
says
he
i
must
have
said
it
or
have
been
hanged
for
our
king
do
not
live
by
meat
nor
drink
but
by
having
great
lyes
told
him
in
our
way
back
we
come
by
a
little
vessel
that
come
into
the
river
this
morning
and
says
she
left
the
fleet
in
sole
bay
and
that
she
hath
not
heard
she
belonging
to
sir
jenings
in
the
fleet
of
any
such
prizes
taken
as
the
ten
or
twelve
i
enquired
about
and
said
by
sir
batten
yesterday
to
be
taken
so
i
fear
it
is
not
true
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
see
stewart
who
is
grown
a
little
too
tall
but
is
a
woman
of
most
excellent
features
sir
richard
ford
did
very
understandingly
methought
give
us
an
account
of
the
originall
of
the
hollands
bank
and
the
nature
of
it
and
how
they
do
never
give
any
interest
at
all
to
the
person
that
brings
in
their
money
though
what
is
brought
in
upon
the
public
faith
interest
is
given
by
the
state
for
the
unsafe
condition
of
a
bank
under
a
monarch
and
the
little
safety
to
a
monarch
to
have
any
or
corporation
alone
as
london
in
answer
to
amsterdam
to
have
so
great
a
wealth
or
credit
it
is
that
makes
it
hard
to
have
a
bank
here
and
as
to
the
former
he
did
tell
us
how
it
sticks
in
the
memory
of
most
merchants
how
the
late
king
when
by
the
war
between
holland
and
france
and
spain
all
the
bullion
of
spain
was
brought
hither
one
third
of
it
to
be
coyned
and
indeed
it
was
found
advantageous
to
the
merchant
to
coyne
most
of
it
was
persuaded
in
a
strait
by
my
lord
cottington
francis
created
lord
cottington
baron
of
hanworth
by
charles
i
died
at
valladolid
to
seize
upon
the
money
in
the
tower
which
though
in
a
few
days
the
merchants
concerned
did
prevail
to
get
it
released
yet
the
thing
will
never
be
forgot
to
deptford
by
water
reading
othello
moore
of
venice
which
i
ever
heretofore
esteemed
a
mighty
good
play
but
having
so
lately
read
the
adventures
of
five
houres
it
seems
a
mean
thing
all
the
afternoon
upon
my
tangier
accounts
getting
tom
wilson
to
help
me
in
writing
as
i
read
and
i
find
myself
right
to
a
farthing
in
an
account
of
batelier
told
me
how
being
with
some
others
at
bourdeaux
making
a
bargain
with
another
man
at
a
taverne
for
some
clarets
they
did
hire
a
fellow
to
thunder
which
he
had
the
art
of
doing
upon
a
deale
board
and
to
rain
and
hail
that
is
make
the
noise
of
so
as
did
give
them
a
pretence
of
undervaluing
their
merchants
wines
by
saying
this
thunder
would
spoil
and
turn
them
which
was
so
reasonable
to
the
merchant
that
he
did
abate
two
pistolls
per
ton
for
the
wine
in
belief
of
that
i
to
james
and
there
with
the
duke
of
york
i
had
opportunity
of
much
talk
with
sir
pen
he
being
newly
come
from
the
fleet
and
he
do
much
undervalue
the
honour
that
is
given
to
the
conduct
of
the
late
business
of
holmes
in
burning
the
ships
and
town
saying
it
was
a
great
thing
indeed
and
of
great
profit
to
us
in
being
of
great
loss
to
the
enemy
but
that
it
was
wholly
a
business
of
chance
knipp
tells
me
my
song
of
beauty
retire
is
mightily
cried
up
which
i
am
not
a
little
proud
of
and
do
think
i
have
done
it
is
decreed
better
but
i
have
not
finished
it
sir
coventry
sent
me
word
that
the
dutch
fleet
is
certainly
abroad
and
so
we
are
to
hasten
all
we
have
to
send
to
our
fleet
with
all
speed
but
lord
to
see
how
my
lord
brouncker
undertakes
the
despatch
of
the
when
he
is
no
more
fit
for
it
than
a
porter
and
all
the
while
sir
pen
who
is
the
most
fit
is
unwilling
to
displease
him
and
do
not
look
after
it
and
so
the
king
work
is
like
to
be
well
done
i
was
a
little
disturbed
with
news
my
lord
brouncker
brought
me
that
we
are
to
attend
the
king
at
white
hall
this
afternoon
and
that
it
is
about
a
complaint
from
the
generalls
against
us
sir
pen
and
i
by
coach
to
white
hall
and
there
staid
till
the
king
and
cabinet
met
in
the
green
chamber
and
then
we
were
called
in
and
there
the
king
begun
with
me
to
hear
how
the
victualls
of
the
fleet
stood
i
did
in
a
long
discourse
tell
him
and
the
rest
the
duke
of
york
lord
chancellor
lord
treasurer
both
the
secretarys
sir
carteret
and
sir
coventry
how
it
stood
wherein
they
seemed
satisfied
but
press
mightily
for
more
supplies
and
the
letter
of
the
generalls
which
was
read
did
lay
their
not
going
or
too
soon
returning
from
the
dutch
coast
this
next
bout
to
the
want
of
victuals
they
then
proceeded
to
the
enquiry
after
the
and
did
all
very
superficially
and
without
any
severity
at
all
but
however
i
was
in
pain
after
we
come
out
to
know
how
i
had
done
and
here
well
enough
but
however
it
shall
be
a
caution
to
me
to
prepare
myself
against
a
day
of
inquisition
being
come
out
i
met
with
moore
and
he
and
i
an
hour
together
in
the
gallery
telling
me
how
far
they
are
gone
in
getting
my
lord
sandwich
pardon
so
as
the
chancellor
is
prepared
in
it
and
sir
bennet
do
promote
it
and
the
warrant
for
the
signing
is
drawn
the
business
between
my
lord
hinchingbroke
and
mallet
is
quite
broke
off
he
attended
her
at
tunbridge
and
she
declaring
her
affections
to
be
settled
and
he
not
being
fully
pleased
with
the
vanity
and
liberty
of
her
carriage
thence
to
discourse
of
the
times
and
he
tells
me
he
believes
both
my
lord
arlington
and
sir
coventry
as
well
as
my
lord
sandwich
and
sir
carteret
have
reason
to
fear
and
are
afraid
of
this
parliament
now
coming
on
he
tells
me
that
bristoll
faction
is
getting
ground
space
against
my
lord
chancellor
he
told
me
that
my
old
lord
coventry
the
lord
keeper
ob
was
a
cunning
crafty
man
and
did
make
as
many
bad
decrees
in
chancery
as
any
man
and
that
in
one
case
that
occasioned
many
years
dispute
at
last
when
the
king
come
in
it
was
hoped
by
the
party
grieved
to
get
my
lord
chancellor
to
reverse
a
decree
of
his
sir
coventry
took
the
opportunity
of
the
business
between
the
duke
of
york
and
the
duchess
and
said
to
my
lord
chancellor
that
he
had
rather
be
drawn
up
holborne
to
be
hanged
than
live
to
see
any
decree
of
his
father
reversed
and
so
the
chancellor
did
not
think
fit
to
do
it
but
it
still
stands
to
the
undoing
of
one
norton
a
printer
about
his
right
to
the
printing
of
the
bible
and
grammar
sir
minnes
bad
a
very
bad
fit
this
day
sir
carteret
tells
me
what
is
done
about
my
pardon
and
is
not
for
letting
the
duke
of
york
know
any
thing
of
it
beforehand
but
to
carry
it
as
speedily
and
quietly
as
we
can
he
seems
to
be
very
apprehensive
that
the
parliament
will
be
troublesome
and
inquisitive
into
faults
but
seems
not
to
value
them
as
to
himself
to
the
wedding
of
longracke
our
purveyor
a
civil
man
and
hath
married
a
sober
serious
mayde
but
the
whole
company
was
very
simple
and
innocent
sir
coventry
did
read
me
a
letter
from
the
generalls
to
the
king
a
most
scurvy
letter
reflecting
most
upon
him
and
then
upon
me
for
my
accounts
not
that
they
are
not
true
but
that
we
do
not
consider
the
expence
of
the
fleet
and
then
upon
the
whole
office
in
neglecting
them
and
the
king
service
and
this
in
very
plain
and
sharp
and
menacing
terms
but
a
great
supply
must
be
made
and
shall
be
in
grace
of
god
to
james
and
there
sir
coventry
took
sir
pen
and
me
apart
and
read
to
us
his
answer
to
the
generalls
letter
to
the
king
that
he
read
last
night
wherein
he
is
very
plain
and
states
the
matter
in
full
defence
of
himself
and
of
me
with
him
which
he
could
not
avoid
which
is
a
good
comfort
to
me
that
i
happened
to
be
involved
with
him
in
the
same
cause
and
then
speaking
of
the
supplies
which
have
been
made
to
this
fleet
more
than
ever
in
all
kinds
to
any
even
that
wherein
the
duke
of
york
himself
was
well
says
he
if
this
will
not
do
i
will
say
as
sir
falstaffe
did
to
the
prince
your
father
that
if
he
do
not
like
this
let
him
kill
the
next
piercy
himself
september
my
wife
and
i
to
polichinelly
polichinello
in
moorfields
but
were
there
horribly
frighted
to
see
young
killigrew
come
in
with
a
great
many
more
young
sparks
but
we
hid
ourselves
so
as
we
think
they
did
not
see
us
lord
day
some
of
our
maids
sitting
up
late
last
night
to
get
things
ready
against
our
feast
jane
called
us
up
about
three
in
the
morning
to
tell
us
of
a
great
fire
they
saw
in
the
city
so
i
rose
and
slipped
on
my
and
went
to
her
window
and
thought
it
to
be
on
the
of
lane
at
the
farthest
but
being
unused
to
such
fires
as
followed
i
thought
it
far
enough
off
and
so
went
to
bed
again
and
to
sleep
about
seven
rose
again
to
dress
myself
and
there
looked
out
at
the
window
and
saw
the
fire
not
so
much
as
it
was
and
further
off
so
to
my
closet
to
set
things
to
rights
after
yesterday
cleaning
by
and
by
jane
comes
and
tells
me
that
she
hears
that
above
houses
have
been
burned
down
by
the
fire
we
saw
and
that
it
is
now
burning
down
all
by
london
bridge
so
i
made
myself
ready
presently
and
walked
to
the
tower
and
there
got
up
upon
one
of
the
high
places
sir
robinson
little
son
going
up
with
me
and
there
i
did
see
the
houses
at
that
end
of
the
bridge
all
on
fire
and
an
infinite
great
fire
on
this
and
the
other
side
the
end
of
the
bridge
which
among
other
people
did
trouble
me
for
poor
little
michell
and
our
sarah
on
the
bridge
so
down
with
my
heart
full
of
trouble
to
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
who
tells
me
that
it
begun
this
morning
in
the
king
baker
his
name
was
faryner
house
in
and
that
it
hath
burned
down
magnes
church
and
most
part
of
already
so
i
down
to
the
and
there
got
a
boat
and
through
bridge
and
there
saw
a
lamentable
fire
poor
michell
house
as
far
as
the
old
swan
already
burned
that
way
and
the
fire
running
further
that
in
a
very
little
time
it
got
as
far
as
the
while
i
was
there
every
body
endeavouring
to
remove
their
goods
and
flinging
into
the
river
or
bringing
them
into
lighters
that
lay
off
poor
people
staying
in
their
houses
as
long
as
till
the
very
fire
touched
them
and
then
running
into
boats
or
clambering
from
one
pair
of
stairs
by
the
to
another
and
among
other
things
the
poor
pigeons
i
perceive
were
loth
to
leave
their
houses
but
hovered
about
the
windows
and
balconys
till
they
burned
their
wings
and
fell
down
having
staid
and
in
an
hour
time
seen
the
fire
rage
every
way
and
nobody
to
my
sight
endeavouring
to
quench
it
but
to
remove
their
goods
and
leave
all
to
the
fire
and
having
seen
it
get
as
far
as
the
and
the
wind
mighty
high
and
driving
it
into
the
city
and
every
thing
after
so
long
a
drought
proving
combustible
even
the
very
stones
of
churches
and
among
other
things
the
poor
steeple
st
lawrence
poultney
of
which
thomas
elborough
was
curate
by
which
pretty
lives
and
whereof
my
old
schoolfellow
elborough
is
parson
taken
fire
in
the
very
top
and
there
burned
till
it
fell
down
i
to
white
hall
with
a
gentleman
with
me
who
desired
to
go
off
from
the
tower
to
see
the
fire
in
my
boat
and
there
up
to
the
king
closet
in
the
chapel
where
people
come
about
me
and
i
did
give
them
an
account
dismayed
them
all
and
word
was
carried
in
to
the
king
so
i
was
called
for
and
did
tell
the
king
and
duke
of
york
what
i
saw
and
that
unless
his
majesty
did
command
houses
to
be
pulled
down
nothing
could
stop
the
fire
they
seemed
much
troubled
and
the
king
commanded
me
to
go
to
my
lord
mayor
sir
thomas
bludworth
from
him
and
command
him
to
spare
no
houses
but
to
pull
down
before
the
fire
every
way
the
duke
of
york
bid
me
tell
him
that
if
he
would
have
any
more
soldiers
he
shall
and
so
did
my
lord
arlington
afterwards
as
a
great
secret
here
meeting
with
captain
cocke
i
in
his
coach
which
he
lent
me
and
creed
with
me
to
paul
and
there
walked
along
as
well
as
i
could
every
creature
coming
away
loaded
with
goods
to
save
and
here
and
there
sick
people
carried
away
in
beds
extraordinary
good
goods
carried
in
on
backs
at
last
met
my
lord
mayor
in
like
a
man
spent
with
a
handkercher
about
his
neck
to
the
king
message
he
cried
like
a
fainting
woman
lord
what
can
i
do
i
am
spent
people
will
not
obey
me
i
have
been
pulling
down
houses
but
the
fire
overtakes
us
faster
than
we
can
do
it
that
he
needed
no
more
soldiers
and
that
for
himself
he
must
go
and
refresh
himself
having
been
up
all
night
so
he
left
me
and
i
him
and
walked
home
seeing
people
all
almost
distracted
and
no
manner
of
means
used
to
quench
the
fire
the
houses
too
so
very
thick
thereabouts
and
full
of
matter
for
burning
as
pitch
and
tar
in
and
warehouses
of
oyle
and
wines
and
brandy
and
other
things
here
i
saw
isaac
houblon
the
handsome
man
prettily
dressed
and
dirty
at
his
door
at
dowgate
receiving
some
of
his
brother
things
whose
houses
were
on
fire
and
as
he
says
have
been
removed
twice
already
and
he
doubts
as
it
soon
proved
that
they
must
be
in
a
little
time
removed
from
his
house
also
which
was
a
sad
consideration
and
to
see
the
churches
all
filling
with
goods
by
people
who
themselves
should
have
been
quietly
there
at
this
time
by
this
time
it
was
about
twelve
and
so
home
and
there
find
my
guests
who
were
wood
and
his
wife
barbary
shelden
and
also
moone
she
mighty
fine
and
her
husband
for
aught
i
see
a
likely
man
but
moone
design
and
mine
which
was
to
look
over
my
closet
and
please
him
with
the
sight
thereof
which
he
hath
long
desired
was
wholly
disappointed
for
we
were
in
great
trouble
and
disturbance
at
this
fire
not
knowing
what
to
think
of
it
however
we
had
an
extraordinary
good
dinner
and
as
merry
as
at
this
time
we
could
be
while
at
dinner
batelier
come
to
enquire
after
woolfe
and
stanes
who
it
seems
are
related
to
them
whose
houses
in
are
all
burned
and
they
in
a
sad
condition
she
would
not
stay
in
the
fright
soon
as
dined
i
and
moone
away
and
walked
through
the
city
the
streets
full
of
nothing
but
people
and
horses
and
carts
loaden
with
goods
ready
to
run
over
one
another
and
removing
goods
from
one
burned
house
to
another
they
now
removing
out
of
which
received
goods
in
the
morning
into
and
further
and
among
others
i
now
saw
my
little
goldsmith
stokes
receiving
some
friend
goods
whose
house
itself
was
burned
the
day
after
we
parted
at
paul
he
home
and
i
to
paul
wharf
where
i
had
appointed
a
boat
to
attend
me
and
took
in
carcasse
and
his
brother
whom
i
met
in
the
street
and
carried
them
below
and
above
bridge
too
and
again
to
see
the
fire
which
was
now
got
further
both
below
and
above
and
no
likelihood
of
stopping
it
met
with
the
king
and
duke
of
york
in
their
barge
and
with
them
to
queenhith
and
there
called
sir
richard
browne
to
them
their
order
was
only
to
pull
down
houses
apace
and
so
below
bridge
at
the
but
little
was
or
could
be
done
the
fire
coming
upon
them
so
fast
good
hopes
there
was
of
stopping
it
at
the
three
cranes
above
and
at
buttolph
wharf
below
bridge
if
care
be
used
but
the
wind
carries
it
into
the
city
so
as
we
know
not
by
the
what
it
do
there
river
full
of
lighters
and
boats
taking
in
goods
and
good
goods
swimming
in
the
water
and
only
i
observed
that
hardly
one
lighter
or
boat
in
three
that
had
the
goods
of
a
house
in
but
there
was
a
pair
of
virginalls
a
sort
of
spinett
so
called
according
to
johnson
from
young
women
playing
upon
it
in
it
having
seen
as
much
as
i
could
now
i
away
to
white
hall
by
appointment
and
there
walked
to
james
park
and
there
met
my
wife
and
creed
and
wood
and
his
wife
and
walked
to
my
boat
and
there
upon
the
water
again
and
to
the
fire
up
and
down
it
still
encreasing
and
the
wind
great
so
near
the
fire
as
we
could
for
smoke
and
all
over
the
thames
with
one
faces
in
the
wind
you
were
almost
burned
with
a
shower
of
this
is
very
true
so
as
houses
were
burned
by
these
drops
and
flakes
of
fire
three
or
four
nay
five
or
six
houses
one
from
another
when
we
could
endure
no
more
upon
the
water
we
to
a
little
on
the
bankside
over
against
the
three
cranes
and
there
staid
till
it
was
dark
almost
and
saw
the
fire
grow
and
as
it
grew
darker
appeared
more
and
more
and
in
corners
and
upon
steeples
and
between
churches
and
houses
as
far
as
we
could
see
up
the
hill
of
the
city
in
a
most
horrid
malicious
bloody
flame
not
like
the
fine
flame
of
an
ordinary
fire
barbary
and
her
husband
away
before
us
we
staid
till
it
being
darkish
we
saw
the
fire
as
only
one
entire
arch
of
fire
from
this
to
the
other
side
the
bridge
and
in
a
bow
up
the
hill
for
an
arch
of
above
a
mile
long
it
made
me
weep
to
see
it
the
churches
houses
and
all
on
fire
and
flaming
at
once
and
a
horrid
noise
the
flames
made
and
the
cracking
houses
at
their
ruine
so
home
with
a
sad
heart
and
there
find
every
body
discoursing
and
lamenting
the
fire
and
poor
tom
hater
come
with
some
few
of
his
goods
saved
out
of
his
house
which
was
burned
upon
hill
i
invited
him
to
lie
at
my
house
and
did
receive
his
goods
but
was
deceived
in
his
lying
there
the
news
coming
every
moment
of
the
growth
of
the
fire
so
as
we
were
forced
to
begin
to
pack
up
our
own
goods
and
prepare
for
their
removal
and
did
by
moonshine
it
being
brave
dry
and
moonshine
and
warm
weather
carry
much
of
my
goods
into
the
garden
and
hater
and
i
did
remove
my
money
and
iron
chests
into
my
cellar
as
thinking
that
the
safest
place
and
got
my
bags
of
gold
into
my
office
ready
to
carry
away
and
my
chief
papers
of
accounts
also
there
and
my
tallies
into
a
box
by
themselves
so
great
was
our
fear
as
sir
batten
hath
carts
come
out
of
the
country
to
fetch
away
his
goods
this
night
we
did
put
hater
poor
man
to
bed
a
little
but
he
got
but
very
little
rest
so
much
noise
being
in
my
house
taking
down
of
goods
about
four
in
the
morning
my
lady
batten
sent
me
a
cart
to
carry
away
all
my
money
and
plate
and
best
things
to
sir
rider
at
which
i
did
riding
myself
in
my
night
gown
in
the
cart
and
lord
to
see
how
the
streets
and
the
highways
are
crowded
with
people
running
and
riding
and
getting
of
carts
at
any
rate
to
fetch
away
things
i
find
sir
rider
tired
with
being
called
up
all
night
and
receiving
things
from
several
friends
his
house
full
of
goods
and
much
of
sir
batten
and
sir
pen
i
am
eased
at
my
heart
to
have
my
treasure
so
well
secured
then
home
and
with
much
ado
to
find
a
way
nor
any
sleep
all
this
night
to
me
nor
my
poor
wife
then
all
this
day
she
and
i
and
all
my
people
labouring
to
get
away
the
rest
of
our
things
and
did
get
tooker
to
get
me
a
lighter
to
take
them
in
and
we
did
carry
them
myself
some
over
tower
hill
which
was
by
this
time
full
of
people
goods
bringing
their
goods
thither
and
down
to
the
lighter
which
lay
at
the
next
quay
above
the
tower
dock
and
here
was
my
neighbour
wife
with
her
pretty
child
and
some
few
of
her
things
which
i
did
willingly
give
way
to
be
saved
with
mine
but
there
was
no
passing
with
any
thing
through
the
postern
the
crowd
was
so
great
the
duke
of
york
come
this
day
by
the
office
and
spoke
to
us
and
did
ride
with
his
guard
up
and
down
the
city
to
keep
all
quiet
he
being
now
general
and
having
the
care
of
all
this
day
mercer
being
not
at
home
but
against
her
mistress
order
gone
to
her
mother
and
my
wife
going
thither
to
speak
with
hewer
beat
her
there
and
was
angry
and
her
mother
saying
that
she
was
not
a
girl
to
ask
leave
every
time
she
goes
abroad
my
wife
with
good
reason
was
angry
and
when
she
come
home
bid
her
be
gone
again
and
so
she
went
away
which
troubled
me
but
yet
less
than
it
would
because
of
the
condition
we
are
in
in
fear
of
coming
in
a
little
time
to
being
less
able
to
keep
one
in
her
quality
at
night
lay
down
a
little
upon
a
quilt
of
hewer
in
the
office
all
my
own
things
being
packed
up
or
gone
and
after
me
my
poor
wife
did
the
like
we
having
fed
upon
the
remains
of
yesterday
dinner
having
no
fire
nor
dishes
nor
any
opportunity
of
dressing
any
thing
up
by
break
of
day
to
get
away
the
remainder
of
my
things
which
i
did
by
a
lighter
at
the
iron
gate
and
my
hands
so
full
that
it
was
the
afternoon
before
we
could
get
them
all
away
sir
pen
and
i
to
the
and
there
met
the
fire
burning
three
or
four
doors
beyond
howell
whose
goods
poor
man
his
trayes
and
dishes
shovells
were
flung
all
along
in
the
kennels
and
people
working
therewith
from
one
end
to
the
other
the
fire
coming
on
in
that
narrow
street
on
both
sides
with
infinite
fury
sir
batten
not
knowing
how
to
remove
his
wine
did
dig
a
pit
in
the
garden
and
laid
it
in
there
and
i
took
the
opportunity
of
laying
all
the
papers
of
my
office
that
i
could
not
otherwise
dispose
of
and
in
the
evening
sir
pen
and
i
did
dig
another
and
put
our
wine
in
it
and
i
my
parmazan
cheese
as
well
as
my
wine
and
some
other
things
the
duke
of
york
was
at
the
office
this
day
at
sir
pen
but
i
happened
not
to
be
within
this
afternoon
sitting
melancholy
with
sir
pen
in
our
garden
and
thinking
of
the
certain
burning
of
this
office
without
extraordinary
means
i
did
propose
for
the
sending
up
of
all
our
workmen
from
the
woolwich
and
deptford
yards
none
whereof
yet
appeared
and
to
write
to
sir
coventry
to
have
the
duke
of
york
permission
to
pull
down
houses
rather
than
lose
this
office
which
would
much
hinder
the
king
business
so
sir
pen
went
down
this
night
in
order
to
the
sending
them
up
morning
and
i
wrote
to
sir
coventry
about
the
business
but
received
no
answer
a
copy
of
this
letter
preserved
among
the
pepys
mss
in
the
author
own
is
subjoined
sir
the
fire
is
now
very
neere
us
as
well
on
tower
streete
as
fanchurch
street
side
and
we
little
hope
of
our
escape
but
by
that
remedy
to
ye
want
whereof
we
doe
certainly
owe
ye
loss
of
ye
city
namely
ye
pulling
down
of
houses
in
ye
way
of
ye
fire
this
way
sir
pen
and
myself
have
so
far
concluded
upon
ye
practising
that
he
is
gone
to
woolwich
and
deptford
to
supply
himself
with
men
and
necessarys
in
order
to
the
doeing
thereof
in
case
at
his
returne
our
condition
be
not
bettered
and
that
he
meets
with
his
approbation
which
i
have
thus
undertaken
to
learn
of
you
pray
please
to
let
me
have
this
night
at
whatever
hour
it
is
what
his
hs
directions
are
in
this
particular
sir
minnes
and
sir
batten
having
left
us
we
can
not
add
though
we
are
well
assured
of
their
as
well
as
all
ye
neighbourhood
concurrence
sir
yr
obedient
servnt
septr
this
night
turner
who
poor
woman
was
removing
her
goods
all
this
day
good
goods
into
the
garden
and
knows
not
how
to
dispose
of
them
and
her
husband
supped
with
my
wife
and
me
at
night
in
the
office
upon
a
shoulder
of
mutton
from
the
cook
without
any
napkin
or
any
thing
in
a
sad
manner
but
were
merry
only
now
and
then
walking
into
the
garden
saw
how
horribly
the
sky
looks
all
on
a
fire
in
the
night
was
enough
to
put
us
out
of
our
wits
and
indeed
it
was
extremely
dreadfull
for
it
looks
just
as
if
it
was
at
us
and
the
whole
heaven
on
fire
i
after
supper
walked
in
the
dark
down
to
and
there
saw
it
all
on
fire
at
the
trinity
house
on
that
side
and
the
dolphin
tavern
on
this
side
which
was
very
near
us
and
the
fire
with
extraordinary
vehemence
now
begins
the
practice
of
blowing
up
of
houses
in
those
next
the
tower
which
at
first
did
frighten
people
more
than
any
thing
but
it
stopped
the
fire
where
it
was
done
it
bringing
down
the
houses
to
the
ground
in
the
same
places
they
stood
and
then
it
was
easy
to
quench
what
little
fire
was
in
it
though
it
kindled
nothing
almost
this
day
went
to
see
how
his
mother
did
and
comes
late
home
telling
us
how
he
hath
been
forced
to
remove
her
to
islington
her
house
in
being
burned
so
that
the
fire
is
got
so
far
that
way
and
to
the
old
bayly
and
was
running
down
to
and
paul
is
burned
and
all
cheepside
i
wrote
to
my
father
this
night
but
the
being
burned
the
letter
could
not
go
i
lay
down
in
the
office
again
upon
hewer
quilt
being
mighty
weary
and
sore
in
my
feet
with
going
till
i
was
hardly
able
to
stand
about
two
in
the
morning
my
wife
calls
me
up
and
tells
me
of
new
cryes
of
fire
it
being
come
to
barking
church
which
is
the
bottom
of
our
lane
sethinge
lane
i
up
and
finding
it
so
resolved
presently
to
take
her
away
and
did
and
took
my
gold
which
was
about
hewer
and
jane
down
by
proundy
boat
to
woolwich
but
lord
what
a
sad
sight
it
was
by
to
see
the
whole
city
almost
on
fire
that
you
might
see
it
plain
at
woolwich
as
if
you
were
by
it
there
when
i
come
i
find
the
gates
shut
but
no
guard
kept
at
all
which
troubled
me
because
of
discourses
now
begun
that
there
is
a
plot
in
it
and
that
the
french
had
done
it
i
got
the
gates
open
and
to
shelden
where
i
locked
up
my
gold
and
charged
my
wife
and
hewer
never
to
leave
the
room
without
one
of
them
in
it
night
or
day
so
back
again
by
the
way
seeing
my
goods
well
in
the
lighters
at
deptford
and
watched
well
by
people
home
and
whereas
i
expected
to
have
seen
our
house
on
fire
it
being
now
about
seven
it
was
not
but
to
the
fire
and
there
find
greater
hopes
than
i
expected
for
my
confidence
of
finding
our
office
on
fire
was
such
that
i
durst
not
ask
any
body
how
it
was
with
us
till
i
come
and
saw
it
was
not
burned
but
going
to
the
fire
i
find
by
the
blowing
up
of
houses
and
the
great
help
given
by
the
workmen
out
of
the
yards
sent
up
by
sir
pen
there
is
a
good
stop
given
to
it
as
well
at
end
as
ours
it
having
only
burned
the
dyall
of
barking
church
and
part
of
the
porch
and
was
there
quenched
i
up
to
the
top
of
barking
steeple
and
there
saw
the
saddest
sight
of
desolation
that
i
ever
saw
every
where
great
fires
and
brimstone
and
other
things
burning
i
became
afraid
to
stay
there
long
and
therefore
down
again
as
fast
as
i
could
the
fire
being
spread
as
far
as
i
could
see
it
and
to
sir
pen
and
there
eat
a
piece
of
cold
meat
having
eaten
nothing
since
sunday
he
forgot
the
shoulder
of
mutton
from
the
cook
the
day
before
but
the
remains
of
dinner
here
i
met
with
young
and
whistler
and
having
removed
all
my
things
and
received
good
hopes
that
the
fire
at
our
end
is
stopped
they
and
i
walked
into
the
town
and
find
and
all
in
dust
the
exchange
a
sad
sight
nothing
standing
there
of
all
the
statues
or
pillars
but
sir
thomas
gresham
picture
in
the
corner
into
our
feet
ready
to
burn
walking
through
the
town
among
the
hot
coles
and
find
that
full
of
people
and
poor
wretches
carrying
their
goods
there
and
every
body
keeping
his
goods
together
by
themselves
and
a
great
blessing
it
is
to
them
that
it
is
fair
weather
for
them
to
keep
abroad
night
and
day
drunk
there
and
paid
twopence
for
a
plain
penny
loaf
thence
homeward
having
passed
through
cheapside
and
newgate
market
all
burned
and
seen
anthony
joyce
house
in
fire
and
took
up
which
i
keep
by
me
a
piece
of
glass
of
mercer
chapel
in
the
street
where
much
more
was
so
melted
and
buckled
with
the
heat
of
the
fire
like
parchment
i
also
did
see
a
poor
cat
taken
out
of
a
hole
in
a
chimney
joyning
to
the
wall
of
the
exchange
with
the
hair
all
burned
off
the
body
and
yet
alive
so
home
at
night
and
find
there
good
hopes
of
saving
our
office
but
great
endeavours
of
watching
all
night
and
having
men
ready
and
so
we
lodged
them
in
the
office
and
had
drink
and
bread
and
cheese
for
them
and
i
lay
down
and
slept
a
good
night
about
midnight
though
when
i
rose
i
heard
that
there
bad
been
a
great
alarme
of
french
and
dutch
being
risen
which
proved
nothing
but
it
is
a
strange
thing
to
see
how
long
this
time
did
look
since
sunday
having
been
always
full
of
variety
of
actions
and
little
sleep
that
it
looked
like
a
week
or
more
and
i
had
forgot
almost
the
day
of
the
week
up
about
five
and
met
gauden
at
the
gate
of
the
office
i
intending
to
go
out
as
i
used
every
now
and
then
to
see
how
the
fire
is
to
call
our
men
to
gate
where
no
fire
had
yet
been
near
and
there
is
now
one
broke
out
which
did
give
great
grounds
to
people
and
to
me
too
to
think
that
there
is
some
kind
of
plot
in
this
on
which
many
by
this
time
have
been
taken
and
it
hath
been
dangerous
for
any
stranger
to
walk
in
the
streets
but
i
went
with
the
men
and
we
did
put
it
out
in
a
little
time
so
that
that
was
well
again
it
was
pretty
to
see
how
hard
the
women
did
work
in
the
cannells
sweeping
of
water
but
then
they
would
scold
for
drink
and
be
as
drunk
as
devils
i
saw
good
butts
of
sugar
broke
open
in
the
street
and
people
give
and
take
handsfull
out
and
put
into
beer
and
drink
it
and
now
all
being
pretty
well
i
took
boat
and
over
to
southwarke
and
took
boat
on
the
other
side
the
bridge
and
so
to
westminster
thinking
to
shift
myself
being
all
in
dirt
from
top
to
bottom
but
could
not
there
find
any
place
to
buy
a
shirt
or
a
pair
of
gloves
westminster
hall
being
full
of
people
goods
those
in
westminster
having
removed
all
their
goods
and
the
exchequer
money
put
into
vessels
to
carry
to
nonsuch
nonsuch
house
near
epsom
where
the
exchequer
had
formerly
been
kept
but
to
the
swan
and
there
was
trimmed
and
then
to
white
hall
but
saw
nobody
and
so
home
a
sad
sight
to
see
how
the
river
looks
no
houses
nor
church
near
it
to
the
temple
where
it
stopped
at
home
did
go
with
sir
batten
and
our
neighbour
knightly
who
with
one
more
was
the
only
man
of
any
fashion
left
in
all
the
neighbourhood
thereabouts
they
all
removing
their
goods
and
leaving
their
houses
to
the
mercy
of
the
fire
to
sir
ford
and
there
dined
in
an
earthen
platter
a
fried
breast
of
mutton
a
great
many
of
us
but
very
merry
and
indeed
as
good
a
meal
though
as
ugly
a
one
as
ever
i
had
in
my
life
thence
down
to
deptford
and
there
with
great
satisfaction
landed
all
my
goods
at
sir
safe
and
nothing
missed
i
could
see
or
hear
this
being
done
to
my
great
content
i
home
and
to
sir
batten
and
there
with
sir
ford
knightly
and
one
withers
a
professed
lying
rogue
supped
well
and
mighty
merry
and
our
fears
over
from
them
to
the
office
and
there
slept
with
the
office
full
of
labourers
who
talked
and
slept
and
walked
all
night
long
there
but
strange
it
is
to
see
clothworkers
hall
on
fire
these
three
days
and
nights
in
one
body
of
flame
it
being
the
cellar
full
of
oyle
up
by
five
and
blessed
be
god
find
all
well
and
by
water
to
pane
wharfe
walked
thence
and
saw
all
the
towne
burned
and
a
miserable
sight
of
paul
church
with
all
the
roofs
fallen
and
the
body
of
the
quire
fallen
into
fayth
paul
school
also
ludgate
and
my
father
house
and
the
church
and
a
good
part
of
the
temple
the
like
so
to
creed
lodging
near
the
new
exchange
and
there
find
him
laid
down
upon
a
bed
the
house
all
unfurnished
there
being
fears
of
the
fire
coming
to
them
there
i
borrowed
a
shirt
of
him
and
washed
to
sir
coventry
at
james
who
lay
without
curtains
having
removed
all
his
goods
as
the
king
at
white
hall
and
every
body
had
done
and
was
doing
he
hopes
we
shall
have
no
public
distractions
upon
this
fire
which
is
what
every
body
fears
because
of
the
talk
of
the
french
having
a
hand
in
it
and
it
is
a
proper
time
for
discontents
but
all
men
minds
are
full
of
care
to
protect
themselves
and
save
their
goods
the
militia
is
in
arms
every
where
our
fleetes
he
tells
me
have
been
is
sight
one
of
another
and
most
unhappily
by
fowle
weather
were
parted
to
our
great
loss
as
in
reason
they
do
conclude
the
dutch
being
come
out
only
to
make
a
shew
and
please
their
people
but
in
very
bad
condition
as
to
stores
victuals
and
men
they
are
at
boulogne
and
our
fleet
come
to
ellen
we
have
got
nothing
but
have
lost
one
ship
but
he
knows
not
what
thence
to
the
swan
and
there
drank
and
so
home
and
find
all
well
my
lord
brouncker
at
sir
batten
tells
us
the
generall
is
sent
for
up
to
come
to
advise
with
the
king
about
business
at
this
juncture
and
to
keep
all
quiet
which
is
great
honour
to
him
but
i
am
sure
is
but
a
piece
of
dissimulation
so
home
and
did
give
orders
for
my
house
to
be
made
clean
and
then
down
to
woolwich
and
there
find
all
well
dined
and
markham
come
to
see
my
wife
this
day
our
merchants
first
met
at
gresham
college
which
by
proclamation
is
to
be
their
exchange
strange
to
hear
what
is
bid
for
houses
all
up
and
down
here
a
friend
of
sir
having
for
what
he
used
to
let
for
per
annum
much
dispute
where
the
shall
be
thereby
the
growth
of
the
city
again
to
be
foreseen
my
lord
treasurer
they
say
and
others
would
have
it
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
i
home
late
to
sir
pen
who
did
give
me
a
bed
but
without
curtains
or
hangings
all
being
down
so
here
i
went
the
first
time
into
a
naked
bed
only
my
drawers
on
and
did
sleep
pretty
well
but
still
both
sleeping
and
waking
had
a
fear
of
fire
in
my
heart
that
i
took
little
rest
people
do
all
the
world
over
cry
out
of
the
simplicity
of
my
lord
mayor
in
generall
and
more
particularly
in
this
business
of
the
fire
laying
it
all
upon
him
a
proclamation
is
come
out
for
markets
to
be
kept
at
leadenhall
and
and
several
other
places
about
the
town
and
and
all
churches
to
be
set
open
to
receive
poor
people
i
stopped
with
sir
carteret
to
desire
him
to
go
with
us
and
to
enquire
after
money
but
the
first
he
can
not
do
and
the
other
as
little
or
say
when
we
can
get
any
or
what
shall
we
do
for
it
he
it
seems
is
employed
in
the
correspondence
between
the
city
and
the
king
every
day
in
settling
of
things
i
find
him
full
of
trouble
to
think
how
things
will
go
i
left
him
and
to
james
where
we
met
first
at
sir
chamber
and
there
did
what
business
we
could
without
any
books
our
discourse
as
every
thing
else
was
confused
the
fleet
is
at
portsmouth
there
staying
a
wind
to
carry
them
to
the
downes
or
towards
boulogne
where
they
say
the
dutch
fleet
is
gone
and
stays
we
concluded
upon
private
meetings
for
a
while
not
having
any
money
to
satisfy
any
people
that
may
come
to
us
i
bought
two
eeles
upon
the
thames
cost
me
six
shillings
thence
with
sir
batten
to
the
whither
the
duke
of
albemarle
is
come
it
seems
the
king
holds
him
so
necessary
at
this
time
that
he
hath
sent
for
him
and
will
keep
him
here
indeed
his
interest
in
the
city
being
acquainted
and
his
care
in
keeping
things
quiet
is
reckoned
that
wherein
he
will
be
very
serviceable
we
to
him
he
is
courted
in
appearance
by
every
body
he
very
kind
to
us
and
i
perceive
he
lays
by
all
business
of
the
fleet
at
present
and
minds
the
city
and
is
now
hastening
to
gresham
college
to
discourse
with
the
aldermen
sir
batten
and
i
home
where
met
by
my
brother
john
come
to
town
to
see
how
things
are
done
with
us
and
then
presently
he
with
me
to
gresham
college
where
infinity
of
people
partly
through
novelty
to
see
the
new
place
and
partly
to
find
out
and
hear
what
has
become
one
man
of
another
i
met
with
many
people
undone
and
more
that
have
extraordinary
great
losses
people
speaking
their
thoughts
variously
about
the
beginning
of
the
fire
and
the
rebuilding
of
the
city
then
to
sir
and
took
my
brother
with
me
and
there
dined
with
a
great
company
of
neighbours
and
much
good
discourse
among
others
of
the
low
spirits
of
some
rich
men
in
the
city
in
sparing
any
encouragement
to
the
poor
people
that
wrought
for
the
saving
their
houses
among
others
alderman
starling
a
very
rich
man
without
children
the
fire
at
next
door
to
him
in
our
lane
after
our
men
had
saved
his
house
did
give
among
thirty
of
them
and
did
quarrel
with
some
that
would
remove
the
rubbish
out
of
the
way
of
the
fire
saying
that
they
come
to
steal
sir
coventry
told
me
of
another
this
morning
in
holborne
which
he
showed
the
king
that
when
it
was
offered
to
stop
the
fire
near
his
house
for
such
a
reward
that
come
but
to
a
man
among
the
neighbours
he
would
give
but
thence
to
bednall
green
by
coach
my
brother
with
me
and
saw
all
well
there
and
fetched
away
my
to
enter
for
five
days
past
i
was
much
frighted
and
kept
awake
in
my
bed
by
some
noise
i
heard
a
great
while
below
stairs
and
the
boys
not
coming
up
to
me
when
i
knocked
it
was
by
their
discovery
of
some
people
stealing
of
some
neighbours
wine
that
lay
in
vessels
in
the
streets
so
to
sleep
and
all
well
all
night
sunday
up
and
was
trimmed
and
sent
my
brother
to
woolwich
to
my
wife
to
dine
with
her
i
to
church
where
our
parson
made
a
melancholy
but
good
sermon
and
many
and
most
in
the
church
cried
specially
the
women
the
church
mighty
full
but
few
of
fashion
and
most
strangers
to
church
again
and
there
preached
dean
harding
probably
nathaniel
hardy
dean
of
rochester
but
methinks
a
bad
poor
sermon
though
proper
for
the
time
nor
eloquent
in
saying
at
this
time
that
the
city
is
reduced
from
a
large
folio
to
a
so
to
my
office
there
to
write
down
my
journall
and
take
leave
of
my
brother
whom

send
back
this
afternoon
though
rainy
which
it
hath
not
done
a
good
while
before
to
sir

to
bed
and
made
my
boy
tom
to
read
me
asleep
all
the
morning
clearing
our
cellars
and
breaking
in
pieces
all
my
old
lumber
to
make

and
to
prevent

then
to
sir

and
dined
and
there
hear
that
sir
rider
says
that
the
town
is
full
of
the
report
of
the
wealth
that
is
in
his
house
and
would
be
glad
that
his
friends
would
provide
for
the
safety
of
their
goods
there
this
made
me
get
a
cart
and
thither
and
there
brought
my
money

away

a
myself
the
now
standing
at
allgate
much
wealth

at
his
house

and
lodged
it
in
my
office
but
vexed
to
have
all
the
world

it
and
with
sir
w
batten
who
would
have
taken
away
my
hands
before
they
were
stowed
but
by
and
by
comes
brother

which
i
was
glad
of

so
got

and
tooker
and
the
boy
to
watch
with
them
all
in
the
office
all
night
while
i
went
down
to
my
wife
in
the
evening
at
sir
pen
at
supper
he
in
a
mad
ridiculous
drunken
humour
and
it
seems
there
have
been
some
late
distances
between
his
lady
and
him
as
my
wife
tells
me
after
supper
i
home
and
with
hater
gibson
probably
clerk
of
the
cheque
at
deptford
in
and
tom
alone
got
all
my
chests
and
money
into
the
further
cellar
with
much
pains
but
great
content
to
me
when
done
so
very
late
and
weary
to
bed
up
and
with
sir
batten
and
sis
pen
to
by
water
and
there
did
our
usual
business
with
the
duke
of
york
up
and
down
to
tower
wharfe
and
there
with
balty
and
labourers
from
deptford
did
get
my
goods
housed
well
at
home
so
down
to
deptford
again
to
fetch
the
rest
and
there
eat
a
bit
of
dinner
at
the
globe
with
the
master
of
the
bezan
with
me
while
the
labourers
went
to
dinner
here
i
hear
that
this
poor
town
do
bury
still
of
the
plague
seven
or
eight
in
a
day
so
to
sir
carteret
to
work
and
there
did
to
my
content
ship
off
in
the
bezan
all
the
rest
of
my
goods
saving
my
pictures
and
fine
things
that
i
will
bring
home
in
wherrys
when
the
house
is
fit
to
receive
them
and
so
home
and
unload
them
by
carts
and
hands
before
night
to
my
exceeding
satisfaction
and
so
after
supper
to
bed
in
my
house
the
first
time
i
have
lain
there
up
and
to
work
having
carpenters
come
to
help
in
setting
up
bedsteads
and
hangings
and
at
that
trade
my
people
and
i
all
the
morning
till
pressed
by
publick
business
to
leave
them
against
my
will
in
the
afternoon
and
yet
i
was
troubled
in
being
at
home
to
see
all
my
goods
lie
up
and
down
the
house
in
a
bad
condition
and
strange
workmen
going
to
and
fro
might
take
what
they
would
almost
all
the
afternoon
busy
and
sir
coventry
come
to
me
and
found
me
as
god
would
have
it
in
my
office
and
people
about
me
setting
my
papers
to
rights
and
there
discoursed
about
getting
an
account
ready
against
the
parliament
and
thereby
did
create
me
infinity
of
business
and
to
be
done
on
a
sudden
which
troubled
me
but
however
he
being
gone
i
about
it
late
and
to
good
purpose
and
so
home
having
this
day
also
got
my
wine
out
of
the
ground
again
and
set
it
in
my
cellar
but
with
great
pain
to
keep
the
porters
that
carried
it
in
from
observing
the
there
captain
cocke
says
be
hath
computed
that
the
rents
of
the
houses
lost
this
fire
in
the
city
comes
to
per
annum
that
this
will
make
the
parliament
more
quiet
than
otherwise
they
would
have
been
and
give
the
king
a
more
ready
supply
that
the
supply
must
be
by
excise
as
it
is
in
holland
that
the
parliament
will
see
it
necessary
to
carry
on
the
war
that
the
late
storm
hindered
our
beating
the
dutch
fleet
who
were
gone
out
only
to
satisfy
the
people
having
no
business
to
do
but
to
avoid
us
that
the
french
as
late
in
the
year
as
it
is
are
coming
that
the
dutch
are
really
in
bad
condition
but
that
this
unhappiness
of
ours
do
give
them
heart
that
there
was
a
late
difference
between
my
lord
arlington
and
sir
coventry
about
neglect
in
the
latter
to
send
away
an
express
of
the
other
in
time
that
it
come
before
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
concerned
himself
in
it
but
this
fire
hath
stopped
it
the
dutch
fleet
is
not
gone
home
but
rather
to
the
north
and
so
dangerous
to
our
gottenburgh
fleet
that
the
parliament
is
likely
to
fall
foul
upon
some
persons
and
among
others
on
the
sir
g
carteret
though
we
both
believe
with
little
ground
that
certainly
never
so
great
a
loss
as
this
was
borne
so
well
by
citizens
in
the
world
he
believing
that
not
one
merchant
upon
the
will
break
upon
it
that
he
do
not
apprehend
there
will
be
any
disturbances
in
state
upon
it
for
that
all
men
are
busy
in
looking
after
their
own
business
to
save
themselves
he
gone
i
to
finish
my
letters
and
home
to
bed
and
find
to
my
infinite
joy
many
rooms
clean
and
myself
and
wife
lie
in
our
own
chamber
again
but
much
terrified
in
the
nights
with
dreams
of
fire
and
falling
down
of
houses
up
betimes
and
shaved
myself
after
a
week
growth
but
lord
how
ugly
i
was
yesterday
and
how
fine
by
water
seeing
the
city
all
the
way
a
sad
sight
indeed
much
fire
being
still
in
sir
coventry
was
in
great
pain
lest
the
french
fleet
should
be
passed
by
our
fleet
who
had
notice
of
them
on
saturday
and
were
preparing
to
go
meet
them
but
their
minds
altered
and
judged
them
when
the
same
day
the
success
captain
ball
made
their
whole
fleet
and
come
to
brighthelmstone
and
thence
at
five
afternoon
saturday
wrote
sir
coventry
news
thereof
so
that
we
do
much
fear
our
missing
them
hence
come
in
and
talked
with
him
sir
thomas
clifford
eldest
son
of
hugh
clifford
of
ugbrooke
for
totness
and
knighted
for
his
conduct
in
the
after
filling
several
high
offices
he
was
in
created
baron
clifford
of
chudleigh
and
constituted
high
treasurer
which
place
he
resigned
the
following
year
a
few
months
before
his
death
who
appears
a
very
fine
gentleman
and
much
set
by
at
court
for
his
activity
in
going
to
sea
and
stoutness
every
where
and
stirring
up
and
down
this
day
the
parliament
met
and
adjourned
till
friday
when
the
king
will
be
with
them
to
james
and
did
our
usual
business
before
the
duke
of
york
which
signified
little
our
business
being
only
complaints
of
lack
of
money
here
i
saw
a
bastard
of
the
late
king
of
sweden
come
to
kiss
his
hands
a
mighty
modish
like
gentleman
thence
to
white
hall
with
sir
batten
and
pen
to
wilkes
and
there
did
hear
many
stories
of
sir
henry
wood
clerk
of
the
spicery
to
charles
and
after
the
restoration
clerk
to
the
board
of
green
cloth
about
lord
norwich
drawing
a
tooth
at
a
health
another
time
he
and
pinchbacke
and
goffe
gough
clerk
of
the
closet
and
her
assistant
confessor
now
a
religious
man
pinchbacke
did
begin
a
frolick
to
drink
out
of
a
glass
with
a
toad
in
it
he
did
it
without
harm
goffe
who
knew
sacke
would
kill
the
toad
called
for
sack
and
when
he
saw
it
dead
says
he
i
will
have
a
quick
toad
and
will
not
drink
from
a
dead
toad
by
that
means
no
other
being
to
be
found
he
escaped
the
health
the
fleet
is
come
into
the
downes
nothing
done
nor
french
fleet
seen
we
drove
all
from
our
anchors
but
sir
carteret
says
news
is
come
that
de
ruyter
is
dead
or
very
near
it
of
a
hurt
in
his
mouth
upon
the
discharge
of
one
of
his
own
guns
which
put
him
into
a
fever
and
he
likely
to
die
if
not
already
dead
the
parliament
meet
and
the
king
to
be
with
them
at
the
office
about
our
accounts
which
now
draw
near
the
time
they
should
be
ready
the
house
having
ordered
sir
carteret
upon
his
offering
them
to
bring
them
in
on
saturday
next
wayth
and
i
by
water
to
white
hall
and
there
at
sir
carteret
lodgings
sir
coventry
met
and
we
did
debate
the
whole
business
of
our
accounts
to
the
parliament
where
it
appears
to
us
that
the
charge
of
the
war
from
september
to
this
michaelmas
will
have
been
but
and
we
have
paid
in
that
time
somewhat
about
so
that
we
owe
above
but
our
method
of
accounting
though
it
can
not
i
believe
be
far
wide
from
the
mark
yet
will
not
abide
a
strict
examination
if
the
parliament
should
be
troublesome
there
happened
a
pretty
question
of
sir
coventry
whether
this
account
of
ours
will
not
put
my
lord
treasurer
to
a
difficulty
to
tell
what
is
become
of
all
the
money
the
parliament
have
given
in
this
time
for
the
war
which
hath
amounted
to
about
which
nobody
there
could
answer
but
i
perceive
they
did
doubt
what
his
answer
could
be
up
and
down
to
look
for
sir
coventry
and
at
last
found
him
and
sir
carteret
with
the
lord
treasurer
at
white
hall
consulting
how
to
make
up
my
lord
treasurer
general
account
as
well
as
that
of
the
navy
particularly
with
all
my
people
to
get
the
letter
writ
over
about
the
navy
accounts
and
by
coach
to
lord
brouncker
and
got
his
hand
to
it
and
then
to
the
parliament
house
and
got
it
signed
by
the
rest
and
then
delivered
it
at
the
to
sir
philip
warwicke
sir
carteret
being
gone
into
the
house
with
his
book
of
accounts
under
his
arme
to
present
to
the
house
all
night
still
mightily
troubled
in
my
sleep
with
fire
and
houses
pulling
down
by
coach
home
calling
at
bennet
our
late
mercer
who
is
come
into
covent
garden
to
a
fine
house
looking
down
upon
the
exchange
and
i
perceive
many
londoners
every
day
come
and
pierce
hath
let
his
wife
closet
and
the
little
blind
bedchamber
and
a
garret
to
a
for
fine
and
per
annum
and
per
annum
more
for
dieting
the
master
and
two
prentices
by
dugdale
i
hear
the
great
loss
of
books
in
paul
and
at
their
hall
also
which
they
value
at
about
some
being
wholly
undone
and
among
others
they
say
my
poor
kirton
and
crumlum
samuel
cromleholme
or
crumlum
master
of
paul
school
all
his
books
and
household
stuff
burned
they
trusting
to
fayth
and
the
roof
of
the
church
falling
broke
the
arch
down
into
the
lower
church
and
so
all
the
goods
burned
a
very
great
loss
his
father
hath
lost
above
in
books
one
book
newly
printed
a
discourse
it
seems
of
courts
here
i
had
the
hap
to
see
my
lady
denham
and
at
night
went
into
the
and
saw
several
fine
ladies
among
others
castlemaine
but
chiefly
denham
again
and
the
duke
of
york
taking
her
aside
and
talking
to
her
in
the
sight
of
all
the
world
all
alone
which
was
strange
and
what
also
i
did
not
like
here
i
met
with
good
evelyn
who
cries
out
against
it
and
calls
it
bickering
for
the
duke
of
york
talks
a
little
to
her
and
then
she
goes
away
and
then
he
follows
her
again
like
a
dog
he
observes
that
none
of
the
nobility
come
out
of
the
country
at
all
to
help
the
king
or
comfort
him
or
prevent
commotions
at
this
fire
but
do
as
if
the
king
were
nobody
nor
a
priest
comes
to
give
the
king
and
court
good
council
or
to
comfort
the
poor
people
that
suffer
but
all
is
dead
nothing
of
good
in
any
of
their
minds
he
bemoans
it
and
says
he
fears
more
ruin
hangs
over
our
heads
my
wife
tells
me
she
hath
bought
a
gown
of
per
yard
the
same
before
her
face
my
lady
castlemaine
this
day
bought
also
sir
pen
proposes
his
and
my
looking
out
into
scotland
about
timber
and
to
use
pett
there
for
timber
will
be
a
good
commodity
this
time
of
building
the
city
our
fleet
abroad
and
the
dutch
too
for
all
we
know
the
weather
very
bad
and
under
the
command
of
an
unlucky
man
i
fear
god
bless
him
and
the
fleet
under
him
a
very
furious
blowing
night
all
the
night
and
my
mind
still
mightily
perplexed
with
dreams
and
burning
the
rest
of
the
town
and
waking
in
much
pain
for
the
fleet
i
to
look
out
penny
my
tailor
to
speak
for
a
cloak
and
cassock
for
my
brother
who
is
coming
to
town
and
i
will
have
him
in
a
canonical
dress
that
he
may
be
the
fitter
to
go
abroad
with
me
no
news
of
the
fleet
yet
but
that
they
went
by
dover
on
the
towards
the
but
whether
the
dutch
be
yet
abroad
or
no
we
hear
not
de
ruyter
is
not
dead
but
like
to
do
well
most
think
that
the
gross
of
the
french
fleet
are
gone
home
again
comes
the
bookbinder
to
gild
the
backs
of
my
books
sir
pen
broke
to
me
a
proposition
of
his
and
my
joining
in
a
design
of
fetching
timber
and
deals
from
scotland
by
the
help
of
pett
upon
the
place
which
while
london
is
building
will
yield
good
money
i
approve
it
sir
coventry
and
i
find
to
our
great
joy
that
the
wages
victuals
wear
and
tear
cast
by
the
medium
of
the
men
will
come
to
above
and
that
the
extraordinaries
which
all
the
world
will
allow
us
will
arise
to
more
than
will
justify
the
expence
we
have
declared
to
have
been
at
since
the
war
viz
lord
day
up
and
to
church
where
i
have
not
been
a
good
while
and
there
the
church
infinitely
thronged
with
strangers
since
the
fire
come
into
our
parish
but
not
one
handsome
face
in
all
of
them
as
if
indeed
there
was
a
curse
as
bishop
fuller
heretofore
said
upon
our
parish
this
month
ends
with
my
mind
full
of
business
and
concernment
how
this
office
will
speed
with
the
parliament
which
begins
to
be
mighty
severe
in
the
examining
our
accounts
and
the
expence
of
the
navy
this
war
october
all
the
morning
at
the
office
getting
the
list
of
all
the
ships
and
vessels
employed
since
the
war
for
the
committee
of
parliament
sir
carteret
tells
me
how
our
lists
are
referred
to
a
to
consider
and
examine
and
that
i
am
ordered
to
be
there
by
and
by
the
committee
met
and
appointed
me
to
attend
them
at
the
office
to
examine
our
lists
the
committee
met
and
i
did
make
shift
to
answer
them
better
than
i
expected
sir
batten
lord
brouncker
pen
come
in
but
presently
went
out
and
minnes
come
in
and
said
two
or
three
words
from
the
purpose
but
to
do
hurt
so
away
he
went
also
and
left
me
all
the
morning
with
them
alone
to
stand
or
fall
and
it
ended
with
good
peace
and
much
seeming
satisfaction
but
i
find
them
wise
and
reserved
and
instructed
to
hit
all
our
blots
to
sir
carteret
and
there
discoursed
much
of
the
want
of
money
and
our
being
designed
for
destruction
how
the
king
hath
lost
his
power
by
submitting
himself
to
this
way
of
examining
his
accounts
and
is
become
but
as
a
private
man
he
says
the
king
is
troubled
at
it
but
they
talk
an
entry
in
the
journals
of
the
house
of
commons
shall
be
made
that
it
is
not
to
be
brought
into
example
that
the
king
must
if
they
do
not
agree
presently
make
them
a
courageous
speech
which
he
says
he
may
do
the
city
of
london
being
now
burned
and
himself
master
of
an
army
better
than
any
prince
before
him
the
have
made
their
report
to
the
grand
committee
and
in
pretty
kind
terms
captain
cocke
told
me
of
a
wild
motion
made
in
the
house
of
lords
by
the
duke
of
buckingham
for
all
men
that
have
cheated
the
king
to
be
declared
traitors
and
felons
and
that
my
lord
sandwich
was
named
kinsman
my
bookseller
come
in
my
may
and
so
i
am
told
by
him
that
kirton
is
utterly
undone
and
made
or
worse
than
nothing
from
being
worth
or
that
the
goods
laid
in
the
churchyard
fired
through
the
windows
those
in
church
and
those
coming
to
the
warehouses
doors
fired
them
and
burned
all
the
books
and
the
pillars
of
the
church
so
as
the
roof
falling
down
broke
quite
down
which
it
did
not
do
in
the
other
places
of
the
church
which
is
alike
pillared
which
i
knew
not
before
but
being
not
burned
they
stood
still
he
do
believe
there
is
above
of
books
burned
all
the
great
almost
undone
not
only
these
but
their
warehouses
at
their
hall
and
under
and
elsewhere
being
all
burned
a
great
want
thereof
there
will
be
of
books
specially
latin
books
and
foreign
books
and
among
others
the
polyglottes
and
new
bible
which
he
believes
will
be
presently
worth
piece
sir
coventry
and
i
discoursed
of
among
others
our
sad
condition
by
want
of
a
controller
and
it
was
his
words
that
he
believes
besides
all
the
shame
and
trouble
he
sir
john
minnes
who
performed
the
duties
inefficiently
hath
brought
on
the
office
the
king
had
better
have
given
than
ever
have
had
him
there
he
did
discourse
about
some
of
these
discontented
and
says
that
birch
is
a
false
rogue
but
that
garraway
is
a
man
that
hath
not
been
well
used
by
the
court
though
very
stout
to
death
and
hath
suffered
all
that
is
possible
for
the
king
from
the
beginning
but
discontented
as
he
is
yet
he
never
knew
a
session
of
parliament
but
that
he
hath
done
some
good
deed
for
the
king
before
it
rose
i
told
him
the
passage
cocke
told
me
of
his
having
begged
a
brace
of
bucks
of
the
lord
arlington
for
him
and
when
it
come
to
him
he
sent
it
back
again
sir
coventry
told
me
it
is
much
to
be
pitied
that
the
king
should
lose
the
service
of
a
man
so
able
and
faithful
and
that
he
ought
to
be
brought
over
but
that
it
is
always
observed
that
by
bringing
over
one
discontented
man
you
raise
up
three
in
his
room
which
is
a
state
lesson
i
never
knew
before
but
when
others
discover
your
fear
and
that
discontent
procures
fear
they
will
be
discontented
too
and
impose
on
you
to
white
hall
where
met
by
sir
batten
and
lord
brouncker
to
attend
the
king
and
duke
of
york
at
the
cabinet
but
nobody
had
determined
what
to
speak
of
but
only
in
general
to
ask
for
money
so
i
was
forced
immediately
to
prepare
in
my
mind
a
method
of
discoursing
and
anon
we
were
called
in
to
the
green
room
where
the
king
duke
of
york
prince
rupert
lord
chancellor
lord
treasurer
duke
of
albemarle
sirs
carteret
coventry
morrice
nobody
beginning
i
did
and
made
a
current
and
i
thought
a
good
speech
laying
open
the
ill
state
of
the
navy
by
the
greatness
of
the
debt
greatness
of
the
work
to
do
against
next
year
the
time
and
materials
it
would
take
and
our
incapacity
through
a
total
want
of
money
i
had
no
sooner
done
but
prince
rupert
rose
up
and
told
the
king
in
a
heat
that
whatever
the
gentleman
had
said
he
had
brought
home
his
fleet
in
as
good
a
condition
as
ever
any
fleet
was
brought
home
that
twenty
boats
would
be
as
many
as
the
fleet
would
want
and
all
the
anchors
and
cables
left
in
the
storm
might
be
taken
up
again
this
arose
from
my
saying
among
other
things
we
had
to
do
that
the
fleet
was
come
in
the
greatest
fleet
that
ever
his
majesty
had
yet
together
and
that
in
as
bad
condition
as
the
enemy
or
weather
could
put
it
and
to
use
sir
pen
words
who
is
upon
the
place
taking
a
survey
he
dreads
the
reports
he
is
to
receive
from
the
surveyors
of
its
defects
i
therefore
did
only
answer
that
i
was
sorry
for
his
highness
offence
but
that
what
i
said
was
but
the
report
we
received
from
those
entrusted
in
the
fleet
to
inform
us
he
muttered
and
repeated
what
he
had
said
and
so
after
a
long
silence
on
all
hands
nobody
not
so
much
as
the
duke
of
albemarle
seconding
the
prince
nor
taking
notice
of
what
he
said
we
withdrew
i
was
not
a
little
troubled
at
this
passage
and
the
more
when
speaking
with
jacke
fenn
about
it
he
told
me
that
the
prince
will
be
asking
who
this
pepys
is
and
find
him
to
be
a
creature
of
my
lord
sandwich
and
therefore
this
was
done
only
to
disparage
him
after
all
this
pains
the
king
hath
found
out
how
to
supply
us
with
or
when
were
at
this
time
but
absolutely
necessary
and
we
mentioned
i
made
my
brother
in
his
cassocke
to
say
grace
this
day
but
i
like
his
voice
so
ill
that
i
begin
to
be
sorry
he
hath
taken
orders
towards
noon
by
water
to
westminster
hall
and
there
by
several
hear
that
the
parliament
do
resolve
to
do
something
to
retrench
sir
carteret
great
salary
but
can
not
hear
of
any
thing
bad
they
can
lay
to
his
charge
the
house
did
this
day
order
to
be
engrossed
the
bill
against
importing
irish
cattle
a
thing
it
seems
carried
on
by
the
western
wholly
against
the
sense
of
most
of
the
rest
of
the
house
who
think
if
you
do
this
you
give
the
irish
again
cause
to
rebel
pierce
says
the
duke
of
york
and
duke
of
albemarle
do
not
agree
the
duke
of
york
is
wholly
given
up
to
this
lady
denham
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
prince
rupert
do
less
agree
the
king
hath
yesterday
in
council
declared
his
resolution
of
setting
a
fashion
for
clothes
which
he
will
never
alter
it
will
be
a
vest
i
know
not
well
how
but
it
is
to
teach
the
nobility
thrift
and
will
do
good
by
and
by
comes
down
from
the
committee
sir
coventry
and
i
find
him
troubled
at
several
things
happened
this
afternoon
which
vexes
me
also
our
business
looking
worse
and
worse
and
our
work
growing
on
our
hands
time
spending
and
no
money
to
set
any
thing
in
hand
with
the
end
thereof
must
be
speedy
ruin
the
dutch
insult
and
have
taken
off
bruant
head
which
they
had
not
dared
to
do
though
found
guilty
of
the
fault
he
did
die
for
of
something
of
the
prince
of
orange
faction
till
just
now
which
speaks
more
confidence
in
our
being
worse
than
before
alderman
maynell
i
hear
is
dead
thence
returned
in
the
dark
by
coach
all
alone
full
of
thoughts
of
the
consequences
of
this
ill
complexion
of
affairs
and
how
to
save
the
little
i
have
which
if
i
can
do
i
have
cause
to
bless
god
that
i
am
so
well
and
shall
be
well
contented
to
retreat
to
brampton
and
spend
the
rest
of
my
days
there
so
to
my
office
and
finished
my
journal
with
resolutions
if
god
bless
me
to
apply
myself
soberly
to
settle
all
matters
for
myself
and
expect
the
event
of
all
with
comfort
to
the
office
where
we
sat
the
first
day
since
the
fire
for
the
fire
with
sir
batten
by
water
to
white
hall
and
anon
had
a
meeting
before
the
duke
of
york
where
pretty
to
see
how
sir
batten
that
carried
the
surveys
of
all
the
fleet
with
him
to
show
their
ill
condition
to
the
duke
of
york
when
he
found
the
prince
there
did
not
speak
one
word
though
the
meeting
was
of
his
asking
for
nothing
else
and
when
i
asked
him
he
told
me
he
knew
the
prince
too
well
to
anger
him
so
that
he
was
afraid
to
do
it
thence
with
him
to
westminster
to
the
parish
church
where
the
and
stillingfleete
in
the
pulpit
so
full
no
standing
there
so
he
and
i
to
eat
herrings
at
the
dog
tavern
and
then
to
church
again
and
there
was
frampton
in
the
pulpit
whom
they
cry
up
so
much
a
young
man
and
of
a
mighty
ready
tongue
i
heard
a
little
of
his
sermon
captain
cooke
who
is
mighty
conversant
with
garraway
and
those
people
tells
me
what
they
object
as
to
the
of
things
as
to
money
but
that
they
mean
well
and
will
do
well
but
their
reckonings
are
very
good
and
show
great
faults
as
i
will
insert
here
they
say
the
king
hath
had
towards
this
war
expressly
thus
much
royal
ayde
more
three
months
tax
given
the
king
by
a
power
of
raising
a
month
tax
of
every
year
for
three
years
customes
out
of
which
the
king
did
promise
to
pay
which
for
two
years
come
to
prizes
which
they
moderately
reckon
at
a
debt
declared
by
the
navy
by
us
the
whole
charge
of
the
navy
as
we
state
it
for
two
years
and
a
month
hath
been
but
so
what
is
become
of
all
this
sum
the
remainder
of
the
receipts
he
and
i
did
bemoan
our
public
condition
he
tells
me
the
duke
of
albemarle
is
under
a
cloud
and
they
have
a
mind
at
court
to
lay
him
aside
this
i
know
not
but
all
things
are
not
right
with
him
and
i
am
glad
of
it
but
sorry
for
the
time
memorandum
i
had
taken
my
journal
during
the
fire
and
the
disorders
following
in
loose
papers
until
this
very
day
and
could
not
get
time
to
enter
them
in
my
book
till
january
in
the
morning
having
made
my
eyes
sore
by
frequent
attempts
this
winter
to
do
it
but
now
it
is
done
for
which
i
thank
god
and
pray
never
the
like
occasion
may
happen
the
house
have
cut
us
off
of
our
wear
and
tear
for
that
which
was
saved
by
the
king
while
the
fleet
lay
in
harbour
in
winter
however
he
seems
pleased
and
so
am
i
that
they
have
abated
no
more
and
do
intend
to
allow
of
men
for
the
next
year
and
this
day
have
appointed
to
declare
the
sum
they
will
give
the
king
and
to
propose
the
way
of
raising
it
so
that
this
is
likely
to
be
the
great
day
to
white
hall
and
there
the
duke
of
york
who
is
gone
over
to
all
his
pleasures
again
and
leaves
off
care
of
business
what
with
his
woman
my
lady
denham
and
his
hunting
three
times
a
week
was
just
come
in
from
hunting
so
i
stood
and
saw
him
dress
himself
and
try
on
his
vest
which
is
the
king
new
fashion
and
he
will
be
in
it
for
good
and
all
on
monday
next
and
the
whole
court
it
is
a
fashion
the
king
says
he
will
never
change
he
being
ready
he
and
my
lord
chancellor
and
duke
of
albemarle
and
prince
rupert
lord
bellasses
sir
cholmly
povy
and
myself
met
at
a
committee
for
tangier
my
lord
bellasses
propositions
were
read
and
discoursed
of
about
reducing
the
garrison
to
less
charge
and
indeed
i
am
mad
in
love
with
my
lord
chancellor
for
he
do
comprehend
and
speak
out
well
and
with
the
greatest
easiness
and
authority
that
ever
i
saw
man
in
my
life
i
did
never
observe
how
much
easier
a
man
do
speak
when
he
knows
all
the
company
to
be
below
him
than
in
him
for
though
he
spoke
indeed
excellent
well
yet
his
manner
and
freedom
of
doing
it
as
if
he
played
with
it
and
was
informing
only
all
the
rest
of
the
company
was
mighty
pretty
he
did
call
again
and
again
upon
povy
for
his
accounts
i
did
think
fit
to
make
the
solemn
tender
of
my
accounts
that
i
intended
i
said
something
that
was
liked
touching
the
want
of
money
and
the
bad
credit
of
our
tallies
my
lord
chancellor
moved
that
without
any
trouble
to
any
of
the
rest
of
the
lords
i
might
alone
attend
the
king
when
he
was
with
his
private
council
and
open
the
state
of
the
garrisons
want
of
credit
and
all
that
could
be
done
should
most
things
moved
were
referred
to
committees
and
so
we
broke
up
and
at
the
end
sir
coventry
come
so
i
away
with
him
and
he
discoursed
with
me
something
of
the
business
they
have
voted
giving
the
king
for
the
next
year
which
were
it
not
for
his
debts
were
a
great
sum
i
met
with
sir
stephen
fox
who
told
me
much
right
i
have
done
myself
and
how
well
it
is
represented
by
the
committee
to
the
house
my
readiness
to
give
them
satisfaction
in
every
thing
when
they
were
at
the
office
i
was
glad
of
this
he
did
further
discourse
of
sir
coventry
great
abilities
and
how
necessary
it
were
that
i
were
of
the
house
to
assist
him
i
did
not
own
it
but
do
myself
think
it
were
not
unnecessary
if
either
he
should
die
or
be
removed
to
the
lords
or
anything
happen
to
hinder
his
doing
the
like
service
the
next
trial
which
makes
me
think
that
it
were
not
a
thing
very
unfit
but
i
will
not
move
in
it
colvill
tells
me
of
the
viciousness
of
the
court
the
contempt
the
king
brings
himself
into
thereby
his
minding
nothing
but
doing
all
things
just
as
his
people
about
him
will
have
it
the
duke
of
york
becoming
a
slave
to
this
lady
denham
and
wholly
minds
her
that
there
really
were
amours
between
the
duchesse
and
sidny
that
there
is
reason
to
fear
that
as
soon
as
the
parliament
have
raised
this
money
the
king
will
see
that
he
hath
got
all
that
he
can
get
and
then
make
up
a
peace
that
sir
coventry
is
of
the
caball
with
the
duke
of
york
and
brouncker
with
this
lady
denham
which
is
a
shame
and
i
am
sorry
for
it
and
that
sir
coventry
do
make
her
visits
but
yet
i
hope
it
is
not
so
pierce
tells
me
that
lady
castlemaine
is
concluded
to
be
with
child
again
and
that
all
the
people
about
the
king
do
make
no
scruple
of
saying
that
the
king
do
intrigue
with
stewart
who
he
says
is
a
most
lady
this
day
the
king
begins
to
put
on
his
vest
and
i
did
see
several
persons
of
the
house
of
lords
and
commons
too
great
courtiers
who
are
in
it
being
a
long
cassocke
close
to
the
body
of
black
cloth
and
pinked
with
white
silk
under
it
and
a
coat
over
it
and
the
legs
ruffled
with
black
riband
like
a
pigeon
leg
and
upon
the
whole
i
wish
the
king
may
keep
it
for
it
is
a
very
fine
and
handsome
garment
lady
carteret
tells
me
ladies
are
to
go
into
a
new
fashion
shortly
and
that
is
to
wear
short
coats
above
their
ancles
which
she
and
i
not
like
but
conclude
this
long
trayne
to
be
mighty
graceful
but
she
cries
out
of
the
vices
of
the
court
and
how
they
are
going
to
set
up
plays
already
and
how
the
next
day
after
the
late
great
fast
the
duchesse
of
york
did
give
the
king
and
queene
a
play
nay
she
told
me
that
they
have
heretofore
had
plays
at
court
the
very
nights
before
the
fast
for
the
death
of
the
late
king
she
do
much
cry
out
upon
these
things
and
that
which
she
believes
will
undo
the
whole
nation
and
i
fear
so
too
this
day
the
great
debate
was
in
parliament
the
manner
of
raising
the
they
voted
the
king
on
friday
and
at
last
after
many
proposals
one
moved
that
the
might
be
taken
from
the
king
and
an
equal
revenue
of
something
else
might
be
found
for
the
king
and
people
be
enjoyned
to
buy
off
this
tax
of
for
ever
at
eight
years
purchase
which
will
raise
present
money
as
they
think
and
the
state
be
eased
of
an
ill
burthen
and
the
king
be
supplied
of
something
as
good
or
better
for
his
use
the
house
seems
to
like
this
and
put
off
the
debate
to
the
court
is
all
full
of
vests
only
my
lord
albans
not
pinked
but
plain
black
and
they
say
the
king
says
the
pinking
upon
whites
makes
them
look
too
much
like
magpyes
and
therefore
hath
bespoke
one
of
plain
velvet
to
lovett
house
where
i
stood
godfather
but
it
was
pretty
that
being
a
protestant
a
man
stood
by
and
was
my
proxy
to
answer
for
me
a
priest
christened
it
and
the
boy
name
is
samuel
the
ceremonies
many
and
some
foolish
the
priest
in
a
gentleman
dress
more
than
my
own
but
is
a
capuchin
one
of
the
priests
he
did
give
my
proxy
and
the
woman
proxy
my
lady
bills
probably
the
widow
of
sir
thomas
pelham
who
john
bills
esq
of
caen
wood
and
retained
the
title
derived
from
her
first
husband
with
the
name
of
her
second
absent
had
a
proxy
also
good
advice
to
bring
up
the
child
and
at
the
end
that
he
ought
never
to
marry
the
child
nor
the
godmother
nor
the
godmother
the
child
or
the
godfather
but
which
is
strange
they
say
the
mother
of
the
child
and
the
godfather
may
marry
by
and
by
the
lady
bills
come
in
a
bred
but
crooked
woman
the
poor
people
of
the
house
had
good
wine
and
a
good
cake
and
she
a
pretty
woman
in
her
dress
it
cost
me
near
the
whole
christening
to
midwife
nurse
maid
and
the
coach
the
business
of
buying
off
the
is
passed
in
the
house
and
so
the
king
to
be
satisfied
some
other
way
and
the
king
supplied
with
the
money
raised
by
this
purchasing
off
of
the
chimnies
nothing
but
distraction
and
confusion
in
the
affairs
of
the
navy
which
makes
me
wish
with
all
my
heart
that
i
were
well
and
quietly
settled
with
what
little
i
have
got
at
brampton
where
i
might
live
peaceably
and
study
and
pray
for
the
good
of
the
king
and
my
country
commissioner
middleton
thomas
middleton
made
a
commissioner
of
the
navy
says
that
the
fleet
was
in
such
a
condition
as
to
discipline
as
if
the
devil
had
commanded
it
so
much
wickedness
of
all
sorts
enquiring
how
it
came
to
pass
that
so
many
ships
had
miscarried
this
year
he
tells
me
that
he
enquired
and
the
pilots
do
say
that
they
dare
not
do
nor
go
but
as
the
captains
will
have
them
and
if
they
offer
to
do
otherwise
the
captains
swear
they
will
run
them
through
he
says
that
he
heard
captain
digby
my
lord
of
bristoll
son
a
young
fellow
that
never
was
but
one
year
if
that
in
the
fleet
say
that
he
did
hope
he
should
not
see
a
tarpawlin
tarpawlin
a
sailor
have
the
command
of
a
ship
within
this
twelve
months
he
observed
while
he
was
on
board
the
admirall
when
the
fleet
was
at
portsmouth
that
there
was
a
faction
there
holmes
commanded
all
on
the
prince
side
and
sir
jeremy
smith
on
the
duke
and
every
body
that
come
did
apply
themselves
to
one
side
or
other
and
when
the
duke
of
albemarle
was
gone
away
to
come
hither
then
sir
jeremy
smith
did
hang
his
head
and
walked
in
the
general
ship
but
like
a
private
commander
he
says
he
was
on
board
the
prince
when
the
news
come
of
the
burning
of
london
and
all
the
prince
said
was
that
now
shipton
prophecy
was
out
and
he
heard
a
young
commander
presently
swear
that
a
wife
that
would
not
take
under
half
a
piece
before
would
be
contented
with
and
made
mighty
sport
of
it
my
lord
chancellor
the
other
day
did
ask
sir
carteret
how
it
come
to
pass
that
his
friend
pepys
do
so
much
magnify
the
bad
condition
of
the
fleet
sir
carteret
tells
me
that
he
answered
him
that
i
was
but
the
mouth
of
the
rest
and
spoke
what
they
have
dictated
to
me
which
did
as
he
says
presently
take
off
his
displeasure
they
talk
that
the
queene
hath
a
great
mind
to
alter
her
fashion
and
to
have
the
feet
seen
which
she
loves
mightily
sir
cholmly
tells
me
how
williamson
stood
in
a
little
place
to
have
come
into
the
house
of
commons
and
they
would
not
choose
him
they
said
no
courtier
and
which
is
worse
bab
may
went
down
in
great
state
to
winchelsea
with
the
duke
of
york
letters
not
doubting
to
be
chosen
and
there
the
people
chose
a
private
gentleman
in
spite
of
him
and
cried
out
they
would
have
no
court
pimp
to
be
their
burgesse
which
are
things
that
bode
very
holmes
did
last
sunday
deliver
in
his
articles
to
the
king
and
cabinet
against
smith
and
smith
hath
given
in
his
answer
and
lays
his
not
accompanying
the
fleet
to
his
pilot
who
would
not
undertake
to
carry
the
ship
further
which
the
pilot
acknowledges
the
thing
is
not
accommodated
but
only
taken
up
and
both
sides
commanded
to
be
quiet
but
no
peace
like
to
be
the
duke
of
albemarle
is
smith
friend
and
hath
publickly
sworn
that
he
would
never
go
to
sea
again
unless
holmes
commission
were
taken
from
him
i
find
by
hayes
prince
secretary
that
they
did
expect
great
glory
in
coming
home
in
so
good
condition
as
they
did
with
the
fleet
and
therefore
i
the
less
wonder
that
the
prince
was
distasted
with
my
discourse
the
other
day
about
the
sad
state
of
the
fleet
but
it
pleases
me
to
hear
that
he
did
expect
great
thanks
and
lays
the
fault
of
the
want
of
it
upon
the
fire
which
deadened
every
thing
and
the
glory
of
his
services
to
pierce
where
she
was
making
herself
mighty
fine
to
go
to
a
great
ball
at
court
being
the
so
the
ladies
for
this
one
day
wear
laces
but
are
to
put
them
off
again
to
williams
where
we
met
knipp
i
was
glad
to
see
the
jade
made
her
sing
and
she
told
us
they
begin
at
both
houses
to
act
on
monday
next
but
i
fear
after
all
this
sorrow
their
gains
will
be
but
little
williams
says
the
duke
house
will
now
be
much
the
better
of
the
two
because
of
their
women
which
i
was
glad
to
hear
the
two
houses
begin
to
be
troublesome
the
lords
to
have
quarrels
one
with
another
my
lord
duke
of
buckingham
having
said
to
the
lord
chancellor
who
is
against
the
passing
of
the
bill
for
prohibiting
the
bringing
over
of
irish
cattle
that
whoever
was
against
the
bill
was
there
led
to
it
by
an
irish
interest
or
an
irish
understanding
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
be
is
a
fool
this
bred
heat
from
my
lord
chancellor
and
something
he
said
did
offend
my
lord
of
ossory
my
lord
duke
of
ormond
son
and
they
two
had
hard
words
upon
which
the
latter
sends
a
challenge
to
the
former
of
which
the
former
complains
to
the
house
and
so
the
business
is
to
be
heard
on
monday
next
then
as
to
the
commons
some
ugly
knives
like
poignards
to
stab
people
with
about
two
or
three
hundred
of
them
were
brought
in
yesterday
to
the
house
found
in
one
of
the
houses
rubbish
that
was
burned
and
said
to
be
the
house
of
a
catholique
this
and
several
letters
out
of
the
country
saying
how
high
the
catholiques
are
every
where
and
bold
in
the
owning
their
religion
hath
made
the
commons
mad
and
they
presently
voted
that
the
king
be
desired
to
put
all
catholiques
out
of
employment
and
other
high
things
while
the
business
of
money
hangs
in
the
hedge
captain
guy
to
dine
with
me
and
he
and
i
much
talk
together
he
cries
out
of
the
discipline
of
the
fleet
and
confesses
really
that
the
true
english
valour
we
talk
of
is
almost
spent
and
worn
out
few
of
the
commanders
doing
what
they
should
do
and
he
much
fears
we
shall
therefore
be
beaten
the
next
year
he
assures
me
we
were
beaten
home
the
last
june
fight
and
that
the
whole
fleet
was
ashamed
to
hear
of
our
bonfires
he
commends
smith
and
cries
out
of
holmes
for
an
idle
proud
conceited
though
stout
fellow
he
tells
me
we
are
to
owe
the
loss
of
so
many
ships
on
the
sands
not
to
any
fault
of
the
pilots
but
to
the
weather
but
in
this
i
have
good
authority
to
fear
there
was
something
more
he
says
the
dutch
do
fight
in
very
good
order
and
we
in
none
at
all
he
says
that
in
the
july
fight
both
the
prince
and
holmes
had
their
and
were
fain
to
go
aside
though
if
the
wind
had
continued
we
had
utterly
beaten
them
he
do
confess
the
whole
to
be
governed
by
a
company
of
fools
and
fears
our
ruine
the
revenge
having
her
forecastle
blown
up
with
powder
to
the
killing
of
some
men
in
the
river
and
the
dyamond
being
overset
in
the
careening
at
sheernese
are
further
marks
of
the
method
all
the
king
work
is
now
done
in
the
foresight
also
and
another
come
to
disasters
in
the
same
place
this
week
in
the
cleaning
which
is
strange
up
and
to
the
office
to
do
business
and
thither
comes
to
me
sir
thomas
teddiman
and
he
and
i
walked
a
good
while
in
the
garden
together
discoursing
of
the
disorder
and
discipline
of
the
fleet
wherein
he
told
me
how
bad
every
thing
is
but
was
very
wary
in
speaking
any
to
the
dishonour
of
the
prince
or
duke
of
albemarle
but
do
magnify
my
lord
sandwich
much
before
them
both
from
ability
to
serve
the
king
and
do
heartily
wish
for
him
here
for
he
fears
that
we
shall
be
undone
the
next
year
but
that
he
will
however
see
an
end
of
it
to
westminster
and
i
find
the
new
lord
mayor
bolton
at
the
exchequer
with
some
of
the
aldermen
and
livery
but
lord
to
see
how
meanely
they
now
look
who
upon
this
day
used
to
be
all
little
lords
is
a
sad
sight
and
worthy
consideration
and
every
body
did
reflect
with
pity
upon
the
poor
city
to
which
they
are
now
coming
to
choose
and
swear
their
lord
mayor
compared
with
what
it
heretofore
was
to
my
goldsmith
to
bid
him
look
out
for
some
gold
for
me
and
he
tells
me
that
ginnys
which
i
bought
of
not
long
ago
and
cost
me
change
will
now
cost
me
and
but
very
few
to
be
had
at
any
price
however
some
more
i
will
have
for
they
are
very
convenient
and
of
easy
disposal
to
white
hall
and
into
the
new
playhouse
there
the
first
time
i
ever
was
there
and
the
first
play
i
have
seen
since
before
the
great
plague
by
and
by
pierce
comes
bringing
my
wife
and
his
and
knipp
by
and
by
the
king
and
queen
duke
and
duchesse
and
all
the
great
ladies
of
the
court
which
indeed
was
a
fine
sight
but
the
play
being
love
in
a
tub
a
comedy
by
sir
george
etheridge
a
silly
play
and
though
done
by
the
people
yet
having
neither
beterton
nor
his
wife
vide
note
to
and
the
whole
thing
done
ill
and
being
ill
also
i
had
no
manner
of
pleasure
in
the
play
besides
the
house
though
very
fine
yet
bad
for
the
voice
for
hearing
the
sight
of
the
ladies
indeed
was
exceeding
noble
and
above
all
my
lady
castlemaine
the
play
done
by
ten
november
on
board
the
ruby
french
prize
the
only
ship
of
war
we
have
taken
from
any
of
our
enemies
this
year
it
seems
a
very
good
ship
but
with
galleries
quite
round
the
sterne
to
walk
in
as
a
balcone
which
will
be
taken
down
my
taylor
man
brings
my
vest
home
and
coat
to
wear
with
it
and
belt
and
sword
i
waited
in
the
gallery
till
the
council
was
up
and
did
speak
with
cooling
my
lord
chamberlain
secretary
who
tells
me
my
lord
generall
is
become
mighty
low
in
all
people
opinion
and
that
he
hath
received
several
slurs
from
the
king
and
duke
of
york
the
people
at
court
do
see
the
difference
between
his
and
the
management
and
my
lord
sandwich
that
this
business
which
he
is
put
upon
of
crying
out
against
the
catholiques
and
turning
them
out
of
all
employment
will
undo
him
when
he
comes
to
turn
the
officers
out
of
the
army
and
this
is
a
thing
of
his
own
seeking
that
he
is
grown
a
drunken
sot
and
drinks
with
nobody
but
troutbecke
whom
nobody
else
will
keep
company
with
of
whom
he
told
me
this
story
that
once
the
duke
of
albemarle
in
his
drink
taking
notice
as
of
a
wonder
that
nan
hide
should
ever
come
to
be
duchesse
of
york
nay
says
troutbecke
wonder
at
that
for
if
you
will
give
me
another
bottle
of
wine
i
will
tell
you
as
great
if
not
greater
a
miracle
and
what
was
that
but
that
our
dirty
besse
meaning
his
duchesse
should
come
to
be
duchesse
of
albemarle
to
my
lady
peterborough
who
had
sent
to
speak
with
me
she
makes
mighty
mourn
of
the
badness
of
the
times
and
her
family
as
to
money
my
lord
passionateness
for
want
thereof
and
his
want
of
coming
in
of
rents
and
no
wages
from
the
duke
of
york
no
money
to
be
had
there
for
wages
or
disbursements
and
therefore
prays
my
assistance
about
his
pension
to
my
lord
crewe
and
there
dined
and
mightily
made
of
here
my
lord
and
sir
thomas
crewe
john
and
dr
crewe
nathaniel
afterwards
bishop
of
durham
and
baron
crewe
and
two
strangers
the
best
family
in
the
world
for
goodness
and
sobriety
here
beyond
my
expectation
i
met
my
lord
hinchingbroke
who
is
come
to
town
two
days
since
from
hinchingbroke
and
brought
his
sister
and
brother
carteret
with
him
who
are
at
sir
carteret
after
dinner
i
and
sir
thomas
crewe
went
aside
to
discourse
of
public
matters
and
do
find
by
him
that
all
the
country
gentlemen
are
publickly
jealous
of
the
courtiers
in
the
parliament
and
that
they
do
doubt
every
thing
that
they
propose
and
that
the
true
reason
why
the
are
for
a
and
against
a
general
excise
is
because
they
are
fearful
that
if
the
latter
be
granted
they
shall
never
get
it
down
again
whereas
the
will
be
but
for
so
much
and
when
the
war
ceases
there
will
be
no
ground
got
by
the
court
to
keep
it
up
he
says
the
house
would
be
very
glad
to
get
something
against
sir
carteret
and
will
not
let
their
inquiries
die
till
they
have
got
something
he
do
from
what
he
hath
heard
at
the
committee
for
examining
the
burning
of
the
city
conclude
it
as
a
thing
certain
that
it
was
done
by
plots
it
being
proved
by
many
witnesses
that
endeavours
were
made
in
several
places
to
encrease
the
fire
and
that
both
in
city
and
country
it
was
bragged
by
several
papists
that
upon
such
a
day
or
in
such
a
time
we
should
find
the
hottest
weather
that
ever
was
in
england
and
words
of
plainer
sense
but
my
lord
crewe
was
discoursing
at
table
how
the
judges
have
determined
in
the
case
whether
the
landlords
or
the
tenants
who
are
in
their
leases
all
of
them
generally
tied
to
maintain
and
uphold
their
houses
shall
bear
the
loss
of
the
fire
and
they
say
that
tenants
should
against
all
casualties
of
fire
beginning
either
in
their
own
or
in
their
neighbour
but
where
it
is
done
by
an
enemy
they
are
not
to
do
it
and
this
was
by
an
enemy
there
having
been
one
convicted
and
hanged
upon
this
very
score
this
is
an
excellent
salve
for
the
tenants
and
for
which
i
am
glad
because
of
my
father
house
after
dinner
and
this
discourse
i
took
coach
and
at
the
same
time
find
my
lord
hinchingbroke
and
john
crewe
and
the
doctor
going
out
to
see
the
ruins
of
the
city
so
i
took
the
doctor
into
my
coach
and
he
is
a
very
fine
sober
gentleman
and
so
through
the
city
but
lord
what
pretty
and
sober
observations
he
made
of
the
city
and
its
desolation
anon
we
come
to
my
house
and
there
i
took
them
upon
to
show
them
what
houses
were
pulled
down
there
since
the
fire
and
then
to
my
house
where
i
treated
them
with
good
wine
of
several
sorts
and
they
took
it
mighty
respectfully
and
a
fine
company
of
gentlemen
they
are
but
above
all
i
was
glad
to
see
my
lord
hinchingbroke
drink
no
wine
at
all
i
home
by
coach
but
met
not
one
bonfire
through
the
whole
town
in
going
round
by
the
wall
which
is
strange
and
speaks
the
melancholy
disposition
of
the
city
at
present
while
never
more
was
said
of
and
feared
of
and
done
against
the
papists
than
just
at
this
time
called
at
faythorne
to
buy
some
prints
for
my
wife
to
draw
by
this
winter
and
here
did
see
my
lady
picture
done
by
him
from
lilly
in
red
chalke
and
other
colours
by
which
he
hath
cut
it
in
copper
to
be
printed
the
picture
in
chalke
is
the
finest
thing
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
i
think
and
i
did
desire
to
buy
it
but
he
says
he
must
keep
it
awhile
to
correct
his
by
and
when
that
is
done
he
will
sell
it
me
by
the
duke
of
york
his
discourse
in
his
chamber
they
have
it
at
court
as
well
as
we
here
that
a
fatal
day
is
to
be
expected
shortly
of
some
great
mischief
whether
by
the
papists
or
what
they
are
not
certain
but
the
day
is
disputed
some
say
next
friday
others
a
day
sooner
others
later
and
i
hope
all
will
prove
a
foolery
but
it
is
observable
how
every
bodys
fears
are
busy
at
this
time
i
to
westminster
hall
and
there
met
grey
who
tells
me
the
house
is
sitting
still
and
now
it
was
six
and
likely
to
sit
till
midnight
and
have
proceeded
fair
to
give
the
king
his
supply
presently
and
herein
have
done
more
than
was
hoped
for
sir
coventry
did
this
night
tell
me
how
the
business
is
about
sir
minnes
that
he
is
to
be
a
commissioner
and
my
lord
brouncker
and
sir
pen
are
to
be
controller
jointly
which
i
am
very
glad
of
and
better
than
if
they
were
either
of
them
alone
and
do
hope
truly
that
the
king
business
will
be
better
done
thereby
and
infinitely
better
than
now
it
is
grey
did
assure
me
this
night
that
he
was
told
this
day
by
one
of
the
greater
ministers
of
state
in
england
and
one
of
the
king
cabinet
that
we
had
little
left
to
agree
on
between
the
dutch
and
us
towards
a
peace
but
only
the
place
of
treaty
which
do
astonish
me
to
hear
but
i
am
glad
of
it
for
i
fear
the
consequence
of
the
war
but
he
says
that
the
king
having
all
the
money
he
is
like
to
have
we
shall
be
sure
of
a
peace
in
a
little
time
to
pierce
by
appointment
where
we
find
good
company
a
fair
lady
my
lady
prettyman
corbet
knipp
and
for
men
captain
downing
lloyd
sir
coventry
clerk
and
one
tripp
who
dances
well
after
our
first
bout
of
dancing
knipp
and
i
to
sing
and
mercer
and
captain
downing
who
loves
and
understands
musick
would
by
all
means
have
my
song
of
beauty
retire
which
knipp
had
spread
abroad
and
he
extols
it
above
any
thing
he
ever
heard
going
to
dance
again
and
then
comes
news
that
white
hall
was
on
fire
and
presently
more
particulars
that
the
was
on
fire
and
so
we
run
up
to
the
garret
and
find
it
so
a
horrid
great
fire
and
by
and
by
we
saw
and
heard
part
of
it
blown
up
with
powder
the
ladies
begun
presently
to
be
afraid
one
fell
into
fits
the
whole
town
in
an
alarm
drums
beat
and
trumpets
and
the
every
where
spread
running
up
and
down
in
the
street
and
i
begun
to
have
mighty
apprehensions
how
things
might
be
for
we
are
in
expectation
from
common
fame
this
night
or
to
have
a
massacre
by
the
having
so
many
fires
one
after
another
as
that
in
the
city
and
at
same
time
begun
in
westminster
by
the
palace
but
put
out
and
since
in
southwarke
to
the
burning
down
some
houses
and
now
this
do
make
all
people
conclude
there
is
something
extraordinary
in
it
but
nobody
knows
what
by
and
by
comes
news
that
the
fire
is
slackened
so
then
we
were
a
little
cheered
up
again
and
to
supper
and
pretty
merry
but
above
all
there
comes
in
the
dumb
boy
that
i
knew
in
time
who
is
mightily
acquainted
here
and
with
downing
and
he
made
strange
signs
of
the
fire
and
how
the
king
was
abroad
and
many
things
they
understood
but
i
could
not
which
i
wondered
at
and
discoursing
with
downing
about
it
why
says
he
it
is
only
a
little
use
and
you
will
understand
him
and
make
him
understand
you
with
as
much
ease
as
may
be
so
i
prayed
him
to
tell
him
that
i
was
afraid
that
my
coach
would
be
gone
and
that
he
should
go
down
and
steal
one
of
the
seats
out
of
the
coach
and
keep
it
and
that
would
make
the
coachman
to
stay
he
did
this
so
that
the
dumb
boy
did
go
down
and
like
a
cunning
rogue
went
into
the
coach
pretending
to
sleep
and
by
and
by
fell
to
his
work
but
finds
the
seats
nailed
to
the
coach
so
he
could
not
do
it
however
stayed
there
and
stayed
the
coach
till
the
coachman
patience
was
quite
spent
and
beat
the
dumb
boy
by
force
and
so
went
away
so
the
dumb
boy
came
up
and
told
him
all
the
story
which
they
below
did
see
all
that
passed
and
knew
it
to
be
true
after
supper
another
dance
or
two
and
then
news
that
the
fire
is
as
great
as
ever
which
put
us
all
to
our
end
and
i
mightily
anxious
to
go
home
but
the
coach
being
gone
and
it
being
about
ten
at
night
and
rainy
dirty
weather
i
knew
not
what
to
do
but
to
walk
out
with
batelier
myself
resolving
to
go
home
on
foot
and
leave
the
women
there
and
so
did
but
at
the
savoy
got
a
coach
and
come
back
and
took
up
the
women
and
so
having
by
people
come
from
the
fire
understood
that
the
fire
was
overcome
and
all
well
we
merrily
parted
and
home
stopped
by
several
guards
and
constables
quite
through
the
town
round
the
wall
as
we
went
all
being
in
arms
the
parliament
did
fall
foul
of
our
accounts
again
yesterday
and
we
must
arme
to
have
them
examined
which
i
am
sorry
for
it
will
bring
great
trouble
to
me
and
shame
upon
the
office
this
is
the
fatal
day
that
every
body
hath
discoursed
for
a
long
time
to
be
the
day
that
the
papists
or
i
know
not
who
have
designed
to
commit
a
massacre
upon
but
however
i
trust
in
god
we
shall
rise
morning
as
well
as
ever
i
hear
that
my
lady
denham
is
exceeding
sick
even
to
death
and
that
she
says
and
every
body
else
discourses
that
she
is
poisoned
and
creed
tells
me
that
it
is
said
that
there
hath
been
a
design
to
poison
the
king
what
the
meaning
of
all
these
sad
signs
is
the
lord
only
knows
but
every
day
things
look
worse
and
worse
god
fit
us
for
the
worst
creed
tells
me
of
my
lady
denham
whom
every
body
says
is
poisoned
and
she
hath
said
it
to
the
duke
of
york
but
is
upon
the
mending
hand
though
the
town
says
she
is
dead
this
morning
this
day
i
received
pieces
of
gold
more
of
stokes
but
cost
me
change
but
i
am
well
contented
with
it
i
having
now
nearly
in
gold
and
will
not
rest
till
i
get
full
creed
and
i
did
stop
the
duke
of
york
being
just
going
away
from
seeing
of
it
at
pauls
and
in
the
house
yard
did
there
see
the
body
of
robert
braybrooke
bishop
of
london
that
died
he
fell
down
in
the
tomb
out
of
the
great
church
into
fayth
this
late
fire
and
is
here
seen
his
skeleton
with
the
flesh
on
but
all
tough
and
dry
like
a
spongy
dry
leather
or
touchwood
all
upon
his
bones
his
head
turned
aside
a
great
man
in
his
time
and
lord
chancellor
and
now
exposed
to
be
handled
and
derided
by
some
though
admired
for
its
duration
by
others
many
flocking
to
see
it
knipp
tells
me
how
smith
of
the
duke
house
hath
killed
a
man
upon
a
quarrel
in
play
which
makes
every
body
sorry
he
being
a
good
actor
and
they
say
a
good
man
however
this
happens
the
ladies
of
the
court
do
much
bemoan
him
sir
carteret
tells
me
that
just
now
my
lord
hollis
had
been
with
him
and
wept
to
think
in
what
a
condition
we
are
fallen
croone
william
croune
of
emmanuel
college
cambridge
chosen
rhetoric
professor
at
gresham
college
and
ob
told
me
that
at
the
meeting
at
gresham
college
which
it
seems
they
now
have
every
wednesday
again
there
was
a
pretty
experiment
of
the
blood
of
one
dog
let
out
till
he
died
into
the
body
of
another
on
one
side
while
all
his
own
run
out
on
the
other
side
the
first
died
upon
the
place
and
the
other
very
well
and
likely
to
do
well
this
did
give
occasion
to
many
pretty
wishes
as
of
the
blood
of
a
quaker
to
be
let
into
an
archbishop
and
such
like
but
as
croone
says
may
if
it
takes
be
of
mighty
use
to
man
health
for
the
amending
of
bad
blood
by
borrowing
from
a
better
body
to
pierce
where
i
find
her
as
fine
as
possible
and
pierce
going
to
the
ball
at
night
at
court
it
being
the
queene
birthday
i
also
to
the
ball
and
with
much
ado
got
up
to
the
loft
where
with
much
trouble
i
could
see
very
well
anon
the
house
grew
full
and
the
candles
light
and
the
king
and
queene
and
all
the
ladies
sat
and
it
was
indeed
a
glorious
sight
to
see
stewart
in
black
and
white
lace
and
her
head
and
shoulders
dressed
with
diamonds
and
the
like
many
great
ladies
more
only
the
queene
none
and
the
king
in
his
rich
vest
of
some
rich
silk
and
silver
trimming
as
the
duke
of
york
and
all
the
dancers
were
some
of
cloth
of
silver
and
others
of
other
sorts
exceeding
rich
presently
after
the
king
was
come
in
he
took
the
queene
and
about
fourteen
more
couple
there
was
and
begun
the
bransles
as
many
of
the
men
as
i
can
remember
presently
were
the
king
duke
of
york
prince
rupert
duke
of
monmouth
duke
of
buckingham
lord
douglas
hamilton
colonell
russell
griffith
lord
ossory
lord
rochester
and
of
the
ladies
the
queene
duchesse
of
york
stewart
duchesse
of
monmouth
lady
essex
howard
only
daughter
of
james
third
earl
of
suffolk
by
his
first
wife
susan
daughter
of
henry
rich
earl
of
holland
afterwards
married
to
edward
lord
griffin
of
braybrooke
there
is
a
portrait
of
her
at
audley
end
by
lely
temple
swedes
embassadresse
lady
arlington
isabella
of
nassau
daughter
of
lord
beverweert
natural
son
of
prince
maurice
she
was
sister
to
the
countess
of
ossory
and
mother
of
the
first
duchess
of
grafton
lord
george
daughter
and
many
others
i
remember
not
but
all
most
excellently
dressed
in
rich
petticoats
and
gowns
and
dyamonds
and
pearls
after
the
bransles
then
to
a
corant
and
now
and
then
a
french
dance
but
that
so
rare
that
the
corants
grew
tiresome
that
i
wished
it
done
only
stewart
danced
mighty
finely
and
many
french
dances
specially
one
the
king
called
the
new
dance
which
was
very
pretty
but
upon
the
whole
matter
the
business
of
the
dancing
of
itself
was
not
extraordinary
pleasing
but
the
clothes
and
sight
of
the
persons
were
indeed
very
pleasing
and
worth
my
coming
being
never
likely
to
see
more
gallantry
while
i
live
if
i
should
come
twenty
times
above
twelve
at
night
it
broke
up
my
lady
castlemaine
without
whom
all
is
nothing
being
there
very
rich
though
not
dancing
this
noon
i
met
with
hooke
and
he
tells
me
the
dog
which
was
filled
with
another
dog
blood
at
the
college
the
other
day
is
very
well
and
like
to
be
so
as
ever
and
doubts
not
its
being
found
of
great
use
to
men
and
so
do
whistler
who
dined
with
us
at
the
tavern
to
belonging
to
the
earl
of
berkshire
afterwards
purchased
by
charles
and
presented
to
the
duchess
of
cleveland
it
was
then
of
great
extent
and
stood
on
or
near
the
site
of
lord
stafford
present
residence
where
my
lord
chancellor
hath
been
ever
since
the
fire
sir
thomas
crewe
told
me
how
hot
words
grew
again
in
the
house
of
lords
between
my
lord
ossory
and
ashly
the
former
saying
that
something
said
by
the
other
was
said
like
one
of
oliver
council
ashly
said
he
must
give
him
reparation
or
he
would
take
it
his
own
way
the
house
therefore
did
bring
my
lord
ossory
to
confess
his
fault
and
ask
pardon
for
it
as
he
did
also
to
my
lord
buckingham
for
saying
that
something
was
not
truth
that
my
lord
buckingham
had
said
to
church
it
being
for
the
cessation
of
the
plague
but
lord
how
the
town
do
say
that
it
is
hastened
before
the
plague
is
quite
over
there
being
some
people
still
ill
of
it
but
only
to
get
ground
of
plays
to
be
publickly
acted
which
the
bishops
would
not
suffer
till
the
plague
was
over
and
one
would
think
so
by
the
suddenness
of
the
notice
given
of
the
day
which
was
last
sunday
and
the
little
ceremony
by
coach
to
and
there
did
get
a
very
great
meeting
the
duke
of
york
being
there
and
much
business
done
though
not
in
proportion
to
the
greatness
of
the
business
and
my
lord
chancellor
sleeping
and
snoring
the
greater
part
of
the
time
i
to
wait
on
sir
philip
howard
whom
i
find
dressing
himself
in
his
and
turban
like
a
turke
but
one
of
the
finest
persons
that
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
he
had
several
gentlemen
of
his
own
waiting
on
him
and
one
playing
finely
on
the
gittar
he
discourses
as
well
as
ever
i
heard
a
man
in
few
words
and
handsome
he
expressed
all
kindness
to
balty
when
i
told
him
how
sicke
he
is
he
says
that
before
he
comes
to
be
mustered
again
he
must
bring
a
certificate
of
his
swearing
the
oaths
of
allegiance
and
supremacy
and
having
taken
the
sacrament
according
to
the
rites
of
the
church
of
england
this
i
perceive
is
imposed
on
all
my
lord
brouncker
did
show
me
hollar
new
print
of
the
city
with
a
pretty
representation
of
that
part
which
is
burnt
very
fine
indeed
and
tells
me
that
he
was
yesterday
sworn
the
king
servant
and
that
the
king
hath
commanded
him
to
go
on
with
his
great
map
of
the
city
which
he
was
upon
before
the
city
was
burned
like
gombout
of
paris
which
i
am
glad
of
batelier
tells
me
the
news
how
the
king
of
france
hath
in
defiance
to
the
king
of
england
caused
all
his
footmen
to
be
put
into
vests
and
that
the
noblemen
of
france
will
do
the
like
which
if
true
is
the
greatest
indignity
ever
done
by
one
prince
to
another
and
would
excite
a
stone
to
be
revenged
and
i
hope
our
king
will
if
it
be
so
as
he
tells
me
it
is
being
told
by
one
that
come
over
from
paris
with
my
lady
fanshaw
who
is
come
over
with
the
dead
body
of
her
husband
and
that
saw
it
before
he
come
away
this
makes
me
mighty
merry
it
being
an
ingenious
kind
of
affront
but
yet
makes
me
angry
to
see
that
the
king
of
england
is
become
so
little
as
to
have
the
affront
offered
him
i
spoke
with
sir
downing
about
our
prisoners
in
holland
and
their
being
released
which
he
is
concerned
in
and
most
of
them
are
then
discoursing
of
matters
of
the
house
of
parliament
he
tells
me
that
it
is
not
the
fault
of
the
house
but
the
king
own
party
that
have
hindered
the
passing
of
the
bill
for
money
by
their
popping
in
of
new
projects
for
raising
it
which
is
a
strange
thing
and
mighty
confident
he
is
that
what
money
is
raised
will
be
raised
and
put
into
the
same
form
that
the
last
was
to
come
into
the
exchequer
and
for
aught
i
see
i
must
confess
i
think
it
is
the
best
way
with
sir
minnes
by
coach
to
stepney
to
the
trinity
house
where
it
is
kept
again
now
since
the
burning
of
their
other
house
in
london
and
here
a
great
many
met
at
sir
thomas
allen
feast
of
his
being
made
an
elder
brother
but
he
is
sick
and
so
could
not
be
there
here
was
much
good
company
and
very
merry
but
the
discourse
of
scotland
it
seems
is
confirmed
and
that
they
are
of
them
in
armes
and
do
declare
for
king
and
covenant
which
is
very
ill
news
i
pray
god
deliver
us
from
the
ill
consequences
we
may
justly
fear
from
it
sir
philip
warwick
i
find
is
full
of
trouble
in
his
mind
to
see
how
things
go
and
what
our
wants
are
and
so
i
have
no
delight
to
trouble
him
with
discourse
though
i
honour
the
man
with
all
my
heart
and
i
think
him
to
be
a
very
able
man
to
sir
carteret
to
dinner
where
much
company
among
others
carteret
and
my
lady
jemimah
and
ashburnham
the
great
man
who
is
a
pleasant
man
and
that
hath
seen
much
of
the
world
and
more
of
the
court
into
the
court
and
attended
there
till
the
council
met
and
then
was
called
in
and
i
read
my
letter
my
lord
treasurer
declared
that
the
king
had
nothing
to
give
till
the
parliament
did
give
him
some
money
so
the
king
did
of
himself
bid
me
to
declare
to
all
that
would
take
our
tallies
for
payment
that
he
should
soon
as
the
money
do
come
in
take
back
their
tallies
and
give
them
money
which
i
giving
him
occasion
to
repeat
to
me
it
coming
from
him
against
the
gre
i
perceive
of
my
lord
treasurer
i
was
content
therewith
and
went
out
all
the
talk
of
scotland
where
the
highest
report
i
perceive
runs
but
upon
three
or
four
hundred
in
armes
here
i
saw
stewart
this
afternoon
methought
the
beautifullest
creature
that
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
more
than
ever
i
thought
her
so
often
as
i
have
seen
her
and
i
do
begin
to
think
do
exceed
my
lady
castlemaine
at
least
now
this
being
day
the
queene
was
at
masse
by
seven
this
morning
and
ashburnham
do
say
that
he
never
saw
any
one
have
so
much
zeale
in
his
life
as
she
hath
and
the
question
being
asked
by
my
lady
carteret
much
beyond
the
bigotry
that
ever
the
old
had
i
spoke
with
may
hugh
may
who
tells
me
that
the
design
of
building
the
city
do
go
on
apace
and
by
his
description
it
will
be
mighty
handsome
and
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
people
but
i
pray
god
it
come
not
out
too
late
ashburnham
today
at
dinner
told
how
the
rich
fortune
mallett
reports
of
her
servants
that
my
lord
herbert
william
lord
herbert
succeeded
his
father
as
sixth
earl
of
pembroke
ob
unmarried
would
have
her
my
lord
hinchingbroke
was
indifferent
to
have
her
my
lord
john
butler
seventh
son
of
the
duke
of
ormond
created
baron
of
aghrim
viscount
of
clonmore
and
earl
of
gowran
ob
not
have
her
my
lord
of
rochester
would
have
forced
her
and
sir
popham
probably
sir
francis
popham
who
nevertheless
is
likely
to
have
her
would
do
any
thing
to
have
her
into
the
house
of
parliament
where
at
a
great
committee
i
did
hear
as
long
as
i
would
the
great
case
against
my
lord
mordaunt
for
some
arbitrary
proceedings
of
his
against
one
taylor
whom
he
imprisoned
and
did
all
the
violence
to
imaginable
only
to
get
him
to
give
way
to
his
abusing
his
daughter
john
mordaunt
younger
son
to
the
first
and
brother
to
the
second
earl
of
peterborough
having
incurred
considerable
personal
risk
in
endeavouring
to
promote
the
king
restoration
was
in
created
baron
mordaunt
of
reigate
and
viscount
mordaunt
of
avalon
he
was
soon
afterwards
made
and
constituted
lord
lieutenant
of
surrey
and
constable
of
windsor
castle
which
offices
he
held
till
his
death
in
in
january
lord
mordaunt
was
impeached
by
the
house
of
commons
for
forcibly
ejecting
william
tayleur
and
his
family
from
the
apartments
which
they
occupied
in
windsor
castle
where
tayleur
held
some
appointment
and
imprisoning
him
because
he
had
presumed
to
offer
himself
as
a
candidate
for
the
borough
of
windsor
lord
was
also
accused
of
improper
conduct
towards
tayleur
daughter
he
however
denied
all
these
charges
in
his
place
in
the
house
of
lords
and
put
in
an
answer
to
the
articles
of
impeachment
for
hearing
which
a
day
was
absolutely
fixed
but
the
parliament
being
shortly
afterwards
prorogued
the
enquiry
seems
to
have
been
entirely
abandoned
notwithstanding
the
vehemence
with
which
the
house
of
commons
had
taken
the
matter
up
perhaps
the
king
interfered
in
lord
mordaunt
behalf
because
andrew
marvel
in
his
instructions
to
a
painter
after
saying
in
allusion
to
this
business
now
mordaunt
may
within
his
castle
tower
imprison
parents
and
the
child
deflower
proceeds
to
observe
each
does
the
other
blame
and
all
distrust
but
mordaunt
new
obliged
would
sure
be
just
here
was
sawyer
afterwards
sir
robert
sawyer
attorney
general
from
to
ob
my
old
at
magdalene
college
where
he
was
admitted
a
pensioner
june
a
counsel
against
my
lord
and
i
was
glad
to
see
him
in
so
good
play
no
news
from
the
north
at
all
and
the
makes
the
business
nothing
but
that
they
are
all
dispersed
to
my
lord
crewe
and
had
some
good
discourse
with
him
he
doubting
that
all
will
break
in
pieces
in
the
kingdom
and
that
the
taxes
now
coming
out
which
will
tax
the
same
man
in
three
or
four
several
capacities
as
for
land
office
profession
and
money
at
interest
will
be
the
hardest
that
ever
came
out
and
do
think
that
we
owe
it
and
the
lateness
of
its
being
given
wholly
to
the
unpreparedness
of
the
king
own
party
to
make
their
demand
and
choice
for
they
have
obstructed
the
giving
it
by
which
had
been
done
long
since
to
white
hall
where
though
it
blows
hard
and
rains
hard
yet
the
duke
of
york
is
gone
we
therefore
lost
our
labour
and
so
to
get
things
ready
against
dinner
at
home
and
at
noon
comes
my
lord
hinchingbroke
sir
thomas
crewe
john
crewe
carteret
and
brisband
i
had
six
noble
dishes
for
them
dressed
by
a
and
commended
as
indeed
they
deserved
for
exceeding
well
done
we
eat
with
great
pleasure
and
i
enjoyed
myself
in
it
eating
in
silver
plates
and
all
things
mighty
rich
and
handsome
about
me
till
dark
at
dinner
and
then
broke
up
with
great
pleasure
especially
to
myself
and
they
away
only
carteret
and
i
to
gresham
college
here
was
henry
howard
that
will
hereafter
be
duke
of
norfolke
who
is
admitted
this
day
into
the
society
and
being
a
very
proud
man
and
one
that
values
himself
upon
his
family
writes
his
name
as
he
do
every
where
henry
howard
of
norfolke
henry
howard
second
son
of
henry
earl
of
arundel
became
on
the
death
of
his
brother
thomas
in
sixth
duke
of
norfolk
having
been
previously
created
baron
howard
of
castle
rising
in
and
advanced
to
the
earldom
of
norwich
he
was
a
great
benefactor
to
the
royal
society
and
presented
the
arundel
marbles
to
the
university
of
oxford
ob
i
late
at
the
office
and
all
the
news
i
hear
i
put
into
a
letter
this
night
to
my
lord
brouncker
at
chatham
thus
i
doubt
not
of
your
lordship
hearing
of
sir
thomas
succeeding
sir
pollard
for
devonshire
ob
in
the
controllership
of
the
king
house
but
perhaps
our
ill
but
confirmed
tidings
from
the
barbadoes
may
not
have
reached
you
yet
it
coming
but
yesterday
viz
that
about
eleven
ships
whereof
two
of
the
king
the
hope
and
coventry
going
thence
with
men
to
attack
christopher
were
seized
by
a
violent
hurricana
and
all
sunk
two
only
of
thirteen
escaping
and
those
with
loss
of
masts
my
lord
willoughby
himself
is
involved
in
the
disaster
francis
fifth
lord
willoughby
of
parnham
drowned
at
barbadoes
and
i
think
two
ships
thrown
upon
an
island
of
the
french
and
so
all
the
men
to
become
their
prisoners
is
said
too
that
eighteen
dutch
are
passed
the
channell
in
order
to
meet
with
our
smyrna
ships
and
some
i
hear
do
fright
us
with
the
king
of
seizing
our
at
gottenburgh
but
we
have
too
much
ill
news
true
to
afflict
ourselves
with
what
is
uncertain
that
which
i
hear
from
scotland
is
the
duke
of
york
saying
yesterday
that
he
is
confident
the
lieutenant
generall
there
hath
driven
them
into
a
pound
somewhere
towards
the
mountains
to
show
how
mad
we
are
at
home
here
and
unfit
for
any
troubles
my
lord
john
did
a
day
or
two
since
openly
pull
a
gentleman
in
westminster
hall
by
the
nose
one
sir
andrew
henly
while
the
judges
were
upon
their
benches
and
the
other
gentleman
did
give
him
a
rap
over
the
pate
with
his
cane
of
which
fray
the
judges
they
say
will
make
a
great
matter
men
are
only
sorry
the
gentleman
did
proceed
to
return
a
blow
for
otherwise
my
lord
would
have
been
soundly
fined
for
the
affront
and
may
be
yet
for
his
affront
to
the
judges
to
white
hall
and
pretty
to
see
it
being
day
how
some
few
did
wear
andrew
crosse
but
most
did
make
a
mockery
at
it
and
the
house
of
parliament
contrary
to
practice
did
sit
also
people
having
no
mind
to
observe
the
scotch
saint
days
till
they
hear
better
news
from
scotland
december
walking
to
the
old
swan
i
did
see
a
cellar
in
in
a
very
fresh
fire
the
late
great
winds
having
blown
it
up
it
seemed
to
be
only
of
that
hath
kept
the
fire
all
this
while
in
it
going
further
i
met
my
late
lord
mayor
bludworth
under
whom
the
city
was
burned
but
a
very
weak
man
he
seems
to
be
by
coach
home
in
the
evening
calling
at
faythorne
buying
three
of
my
lady
castlemaine
heads
printed
this
day
which
indeed
is
as
to
the
head
i
think
a
very
fine
picture
and
like
her
i
did
this
afternoon
get
michell
to
let
me
only
have
a
sight
of
a
pamphlet
lately
printed
but
suppressed
and
much
called
after
called
the
apology
lamenting
the
severity
of
the
parliament
against
them
and
comparing
it
with
the
lenity
of
other
princes
to
protestants
giving
old
and
late
instances
of
their
loyalty
to
their
princes
whatever
is
objected
against
them
and
excusing
their
disquiets
in
queene
elizabeth
time
for
that
it
was
impossible
for
them
to
think
her
a
lawfull
queene
if
queene
mary
who
had
been
owned
as
such
were
so
one
being
the
daughter
of
the
true
and
the
other
of
a
false
wife
and
that
of
the
gunpowder
treason
by
saying
that
it
was
only
the
practice
of
some
of
us
if
not
the
king
to
trepan
some
of
their
religion
into
it
it
never
being
defended
by
the
generality
of
their
church
nor
indeed
known
by
them
and
ends
with
a
large
catalogue
in
red
letters
of
the
catholiques
which
have
lost
their
lives
in
the
quarrel
of
the
late
king
and
this
the
thing
is
very
well
writ
indeed
took
coach
and
no
sooner
in
the
coach
but
something
broke
that
we
were
fain
there
to
stay
till
a
smith
could
be
fetched
which
was
above
an
hour
and
then
it
costing
me
to
mend
away
round
by
the
wall
and
for
fear
it
should
break
again
and
in
pain
about
the
coach
all
the
way
i
went
to
sir
batten
and
there
i
hear
more
ill
news
still
that
all
our
fleet
which
went
out
lately
are
put
back
a
third
time
by
foul
weather
and
dispersed
some
to
one
port
and
some
to
another
and
their
convoys
also
to
plymouth
and
whether
any
of
them
be
lost
or
no
we
do
not
know
this
added
to
all
the
rest
do
lay
us
flat
in
our
hopes
and
courages
every
body
prophesying
destruction
to
the
nation
more
cheerful
than
i
have
been
a
good
while
to
hear
that
for
certain
the
scott
rebels
are
all
routed
they
having
been
so
bold
as
to
come
within
three
miles
of
edinburgh
and
there
given
two
or
three
repulses
to
the
king
forces
but
at
last
were
mastered
three
or
four
hundred
killed
or
taken
among
which
their
leader
wallis
and
seven
ministers
they
having
all
taken
the
covenant
a
few
days
before
and
sworn
to
live
and
die
in
it
as
they
did
and
so
all
is
likely
to
be
there
quiet
again
there
is
also
the
very
good
news
come
of
four
ships
come
home
safe
to
falmouth
with
masts
for
the
king
which
is
a
blessing
mighty
unexpected
and
without
which
if
for
nothing
else
we
must
have
failed
the
next
year
but
god
be
praised
for
thus
much
good
fortune
and
send
us
the
continuance
of
his
favour
in
other
things
after
dinner
my
wife
and
brother
john
pepys
who
being
in
holy
orders
had
lately
assumed
the
canonical
habit
he
died
in
at
which
period
he
held
some
office
in
the
pepys
ms
letters
in
another
habit
go
out
to
see
a
play
but
i
am
not
to
take
notice
that
i
know
of
my
brother
going
this
day
in
the
gazette
is
the
whole
story
of
defeating
of
scotch
rebells
and
of
the
creation
of
the
duke
of
cambridge
knight
of
the
garter
to
the
king
playhouse
where
two
acts
were
almost
done
when
i
come
in
and
there
i
sat
with
my
cloak
about
my
face
and
saw
the
remainder
of
the
mayd
tragedy
by
beaumont
and
fletcher
a
good
play
and
well
acted
especially
by
the
younger
marshall
who
is
become
a
pretty
good
actor
and
is
the
first
play
i
have
seen
in
either
of
the
houses
since
before
the
great
plague
they
having
acted
now
about
fourteen
days
publickly
but
i
was
in
mighty
pain
lest
i
should
be
seen
by
any
body
to
be
at
a
play
the
great
proviso
passed
the
house
of
parliament
yesterday
which
makes
the
king
and
court
mad
the
king
having
given
order
to
my
lord
chamberlain
to
send
to
the
playhouses
and
brothels
to
bid
all
the
that
were
there
to
go
to
the
parliament
presently
this
is
true
it
seems
but
it
was
carried
against
the
court
by
thirty
or
forty
voices
it
is
a
proviso
to
the
poll
bill
that
there
shall
be
a
committee
of
nine
persons
that
shall
have
the
inspection
upon
oath
and
power
of
giving
others
of
all
the
accounts
of
the
money
given
and
spent
for
this
warr
this
hath
a
most
sad
face
and
will
breed
very
ill
blood
he
tells
me
brought
in
by
sir
robert
howard
a
younger
son
of
thomas
earl
of
berkshire
educated
at
magdalene
college
cambridge
knighted
at
the
restoration
and
chosen
for
stockbridge
and
afterwards
for
castle
rising
he
was
auditor
of
the
exchequer
and
a
creature
of
charles
who
employed
him
in
cajoling
the
parliament
for
money
he
published
some
poems
plays
and
political
tracts
ob
who
is
one
of
the
king
servants
at
least
hath
a
great
office
and
hath
got
they
say
since
the
king
come
in
pierce
did
also
tell
me
as
a
great
truth
as
being
told
it
by
cowly
abraham
cowley
the
poet
who
was
by
and
heard
it
that
tom
killigrew
should
publickly
tell
the
king
that
his
matters
were
coming
into
a
very
ill
state
but
that
yet
there
was
a
way
to
help
all
says
he
there
is
a
good
honest
able
man
that
i
could
name
that
if
your
majesty
would
employ
and
command
to
see
all
things
well
executed
all
things
would
soon
be
mended
and
this
is
one
charles
stuart
who
now
spends
his
time
in
employing
his
lips
about
the
court
and
hath
no
other
employment
but
if
you
would
give
him
this
employment
he
were
the
fittest
man
in
the
world
to
perform
it
this
he
says
is
most
true
but
the
king
do
not
profit
by
any
of
this
but
lays
all
aside
and
remembers
nothing
but
to
his
pleasures
again
which
is
a
sorowful
consideration
to
the
king
and
there
did
see
a
good
part
of
the
english
monsieur
a
comedy
by
james
howard
which
is
a
mighty
pretty
play
very
witty
and
pleasant
and
the
women
do
very
well
but
above
all
little
nelly
i
hear
that
this
proviso
in
parliament
is
mightily
ill
taken
by
all
the
court
party
as
a
mortal
blow
and
that
that
strikes
deep
into
the
prerogative
which
troubles
me
mightily
in
much
fear
of
ill
news
of
our
colliers
a
fleet
of
sail
and
dutch
war
between
them
and
us
and
they
coming
home
with
small
convoy
and
the
city
in
great
want
coals
being
at
per
chaldron
as
i
am
told
i
saw
smoke
in
the
ruines
this
very
day
captain
cocke
with
whom
i
walked
in
the
garden
tells
me
how
angry
the
court
is
at
the
late
proviso
brought
in
by
the
house
how
still
my
lord
chancellor
is
not
daring
to
do
or
say
any
thing
to
displease
the
parliament
that
the
parliament
is
in
a
very
ill
humour
and
grows
every
day
more
and
more
so
and
that
the
unskilfulness
of
the
court
and
their
difference
among
one
another
is
the
occasion
of
all
not
agreeing
in
what
they
would
have
and
so
they
give
leisure
and
occasion
to
the
other
part
to
run
away
with
what
the
court
would
not
have
this
day
the
poll
bill
was
to
be
passed
and
great
endeavours
used
to
take
away
the
proviso
sir
cholmly
did
with
grief
tell
me
how
the
parliament
hath
been
told
plainly
that
the
king
hath
been
heard
to
say
that
he
would
dissolve
them
rather
than
pass
this
bill
with
the
proviso
but
tells
me
that
the
proviso
is
removed
and
now
carried
that
it
shall
be
done
by
a
bill
by
itself
he
tells
me
how
the
king
hath
lately
paid
above
to
clear
the
debts
of
my
lady
castlemaine
and
that
she
and
her
husband
are
parted
for
ever
upon
good
terms
never
to
trouble
one
another
more
he
says
that
he
hears
that
above
hath
gone
into
the
purse
since
this
warr
and
that
that
hath
consumed
so
much
of
our
money
and
makes
the
king
and
court
so
mad
to
be
brought
to
discover
it
the
very
good
newes
is
just
come
of
our
four
ships
from
smyrna
come
safe
without
convoy
even
into
the
downes
without
seeing
any
enemy
which
is
the
best
and
indeed
only
considerable
good
news
to
our
exchange
since
the
burning
of
the
city
and
it
is
strange
to
see
how
it
do
cheer
up
men
hearts
here
i
saw
shops
now
come
to
be
in
this
exchange
and
met
little
batelier
who
sits
here
but
at
per
annum
whereas
he
sat
at
the
other
at
which
he
says
he
believes
will
prove
as
good
account
to
him
now
as
the
other
did
at
that
rent
they
talk
for
certain
that
now
the
king
do
follow
stewart
wholly
and
my
lady
castlemaine
not
above
once
that
the
duke
of
york
do
not
haunt
my
lady
denham
so
much
that
she
troubles
him
with
matters
of
state
being
of
my
lord
bristoll
faction
and
that
he
avoids
that
she
is
ill
still
news
this
day
from
brampton
of
ensum
my
sister
sweetheart
being
dead
a
clowne
hewer
dined
with
me
and
showed
me
a
gazette
in
april
last
which
i
wonder
should
never
be
remembered
by
any
body
which
tells
how
several
persons
were
then
tried
for
their
lives
and
were
found
guilty
of
a
design
of
killing
the
king
and
destroying
the
government
and
as
a
means
to
it
to
burn
the
city
and
that
the
day
intended
for
the
plot
was
the
of
last
september
and
the
fire
did
indeed
break
out
on
the
of
september
which
is
very
strange
methinks
this
circumstance
was
so
remarkable
that
it
has
been
thought
worth
while
extracting
the
whole
passage
from
the
gazette
of
april
at
the
sessions
in
the
old
bailey
john
rathbone
an
old
army
colonel
william
saunders
henry
tucker
thomas
flint
thomas
evans
john
myles
will
westcot
and
john
cole
officers
or
soldiers
in
the
late
rebellion
were
indicted
for
conspiring
the
death
of
his
majesty
and
the
overthrow
of
the
government
having
laid
their
plot
and
contrivance
for
the
surprisal
of
the
tower
the
killing
his
grace
the
lord
general
sir
john
robinson
lieutenant
of
the
tower
and
sir
richard
brown
and
then
to
have
declared
for
an
equal
division
of
lands
the
better
to
effect
this
hellish
design
the
city
was
to
have
been
fired
and
the
portcullis
let
down
to
keep
out
all
assistance
and
the
horse
guards
to
have
been
suprised
in
the
inns
where
they
were
quartered
several
ostlers
having
been
gained
for
that
purpose
the
tower
was
accordingly
viewed
and
its
suprise
ordered
by
boats
over
the
moat
and
from
thence
to
scale
the
wall
one
alexander
not
yet
taken
had
likewise
distributed
money
to
these
conspirators
and
for
the
carrying
on
the
design
most
effectually
they
were
told
of
a
council
of
the
great
ones
that
sat
frequently
in
london
from
whom
issued
all
orders
which
council
received
their
directions
from
another
in
holland
who
sat
with
the
states
and
that
the
third
of
september
was
pitched
on
for
the
attempt
as
being
found
by
lilly
almanack
and
a
scheme
erected
for
that
purpose
to
be
a
lucky
day
a
planet
then
ruling
which
prognosticated
the
downfall
of
monarchy
the
evidence
against
these
persons
was
very
full
and
clear
and
they
were
accordingly
found
guilty
of
high
treason
met
my
good
friend
evelyn
and
walked
with
him
a
good
while
lamenting
our
condition
for
want
of
good
council
and
the
king
minding
of
his
business
and
servants
the
house
sat
till
three
and
then
up
and
i
home
with
sir
stephen
fox
to
his
house
to
dinner
and
the
cofferer
william
ashburnham
an
officer
of
distinction
in
the
king
army
during
the
civil
war
and
after
the
restoration
made
cofferer
to
charles
ii
ob
with
us
there
i
found
his
lady
a
fine
woman
and
seven
the
prettiest
children
of
theirs
that
ever
i
knew
almost
a
very
genteel
dinner
and
in
great
state
and
fashion
and
excellent
discourse
and
nothing
like
an
old
experienced
man
and
a
courtier
and
such
is
the
cofferer
ashburnham
the
house
have
been
mighty
hot
against
the
paper
bill
showing
all
manner
of
averseness
to
give
the
king
money
which
these
courtiers
do
take
mighty
notice
of
and
look
upon
the
others
as
bad
rebells
as
ever
the
last
were
but
the
courtiers
did
carry
it
against
those
men
upon
a
division
of
the
house
a
great
many
that
it
should
be
committed
and
so
it
was
which
they
reckon
good
news
to
the
office
where
my
lord
brouncker
newly
come
to
town
from
his
being
at
chatham
and
harwich
to
spy
enormities
and
at
noon
i
with
him
and
his
lady
williams
to
captain
cocke
where
a
good
dinner
and
very
merry
good
news
upon
the
exchange
that
our
hamburgh
fleet
is
got
in
and
good
hopes
that
we
will
soon
have
the
like
of
our
gottenburgh
and
then
we
shall
be
well
for
this
winter
and
by
and
by
comes
in
matt
wren
matthew
wren
eldest
son
of
the
bishop
of
ely
of
both
his
names
for
michael
and
made
secretary
to
lord
clarendon
after
whose
fall
he
filled
the
same
office
under
the
duke
of
york
till
his
death
in
he
was
one
of
the
earliest
members
of
the
royal
society
and
published
two
tracts
in
answer
to
harrington
oceana
from
the
and
tells
us
that
he
and
all
his
party
of
the
house
which
is
the
court
party
are
fools
and
have
been
made
so
this
day
by
the
wise
men
of
the
other
side
for
after
the
court
party
had
carried
it
yesterday
so
powerfully
for
the
paper
bill
yet
now
it
is
laid
aside
wholly
and
to
be
supplied
by
a
which
it
is
true
will
do
well
and
will
be
the
sooner
finished
which
was
the
great
argument
for
the
doing
of
it
but
then
it
shows
them
fools
that
they
would
not
permit
this
to
have
been
done
six
weeks
ago
which
they
might
have
had
and
next
they
have
parted
with
the
paper
bill
which
when
once
begun
might
have
proved
a
very
good
flower
in
the
crowne
as
any
there
so
they
are
truly
outwitted
by
the
other
side
to
white
hall
and
there
walked
up
and
down
to
the
queene
side
and
there
saw
my
dear
lady
castlemaine
who
continues
admirable
methinks
and
i
do
not
hear
that
but
the
king
is
the
same
to
her
still
as
ever
anon
to
chapel
by
the
king
closet
and
heard
a
very
good
anthem
then
with
lord
brouncker
to
sir
coventry
chamber
and
there
we
sat
with
him
and
talked
he
is
weary
of
any
thing
to
do
he
says
in
the
navy
he
tells
us
this
committee
of
accounts
will
enquire
sharply
into
our
office
to
sir
neale
chamber
sir
edward
walker
being
there
and
telling
us
how
he
hath
lost
many
fine
rowles
of
antiquity
in
heraldry
by
the
late
fire
but
hath
saved
the
most
of
his
papers
here
was
also
wallis
john
wallis
savilian
professor
of
geometry
ob
aged
the
famous
scholar
and
mathematician
but
he
promises
little
the
duke
of
monmonth
lord
brouncker
says
spends
his
time
the
most
viciously
and
idle
of
any
man
nor
will
be
fit
for
any
thing
yet
he
speaks
as
if
it
were
not
impossible
but
the
king
would
own
him
for
his
son
and
that
there
was
marriage
between
his
mother
and
him
my
wife
well
home
in
the
evening
from
the
play
which
i
was
glad
of
it
being
cold
and
dark
and
she
having
her
necklace
of
pearl
on
and
none
but
mercer
with
her
talked
of
the
king
family
with
hingston
the
organist
he
says
many
of
the
musique
are
ready
to
starve
they
being
five
years
behind
hand
for
their
wages
nay
evens
the
famous
man
upon
the
harp
having
not
his
equal
in
the
world
did
the
other
day
die
for
mere
want
and
was
fain
to
be
buried
at
the
almes
of
the
parish
and
carried
to
his
grave
in
the
dark
at
night
without
one
linke
but
that
hingston
met
it
by
chance
and
did
give
to
buy
two
or
three
links
thence
i
up
to
the
lords
house
to
enquire
for
my
lord
bellasses
and
there
hear
how
at
a
conference
this
morning
between
the
two
houses
about
the
business
of
the
canary
company
my
lord
buckingham
leaning
rudely
over
my
lord
marquis
dorchester
henry
second
earl
of
kingston
created
marquis
of
dorchester
ob
see
an
account
of
this
quarrel
in
lord
clarendon
life
my
lord
dorchester
removed
his
elbow
duke
of
buckingham
asked
whether
he
was
uneasy
dorchester
replied
yes
and
that
he
durst
not
do
this
were
he
any
where
else
buckingham
replied
yes
he
would
and
that
he
was
a
better
man
than
himself
dorchester
said
that
he
lyed
with
this
buckingham
struck
off
his
hat
and
took
him
by
his
periwigg
and
pulled
it
aside
and
held
him
my
lord
chamberlain
and
others
interposed
and
upon
coming
into
the
house
the
lords
did
order
them
both
to
the
tower
whither
they
are
to
go
this
afternoon
i
down
into
the
hall
and
there
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
took
me
with
him
and
would
have
me
to
the
tower
to
dinner
where
i
dined
at
the
head
of
his
table
next
his
lady
who
is
comely
and
seeming
sober
and
stately
but
very
proud
and
very
cunning
or
i
am
mistaken
and
wanton
too
this
day
work
will
bring
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
thence
home
and
upon
tower
hill
saw
about
or
seamen
get
together
and
one
standing
upon
a
pile
of
bricks
made
his
sign
with
his
handkercher
upon
his
stick
and
called
all
the
rest
to
him
and
several
shouts
they
gave
this
made
me
afraid
so
i
got
home
as
fast
as
i
could
but
by
and
by
sir
batten
and
sir
ford
do
tell
me
that
the
seamen
have
been
at
some
prisons
to
release
some
seamen
and
the
duke
of
albemarle
is
in
armes
and
all
the
guards
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
and
the
duke
of
albemarle
is
gone
with
some
forces
to
wapping
to
quell
the
seamen
which
is
a
thing
of
infinite
disgrace
to
us
i
sat
long
talking
with
them
and
among
other
things
sir
ford
did
make
me
understand
how
the
house
of
commons
is
a
beast
not
to
be
understood
it
being
impossible
to
know
beforehand
the
success
almost
of
any
small
plain
thing
there
being
so
many
to
think
and
speak
to
any
business
and
they
of
so
uncertain
minds
and
interests
and
passions
he
did
tell
me
and
so
did
sir
batten
how
sir
allen
brodericke
son
of
sir
thomas
broderick
of
richmond
yorkshire
and
wandsworth
surrey
knighted
by
charles
and
in
ireland
to
his
majesty
and
sir
allen
apsly
did
come
drunk
the
other
day
into
the
house
and
did
both
speak
for
half
an
hour
together
and
could
not
be
either
laughed
or
pulled
or
bid
to
sit
down
and
hold
their
peace
to
the
great
contempt
of
the
king
servants
and
cause
which
i
am
grieved
at
with
all
my
heart
lord
day
to
church
where
a
vain
fellow
with
a
periwigg
preached
chaplain
as
by
his
prayer
appeared
to
the
earle
of
carlisle
it
being
frost
and
dry
as
far
as
paul
and
so
back
again
through
the
city
by
guildhall
observing
the
ruins
thereabouts
till
i
did
truly
lose
myself
no
news
yet
of
our
gottenburgh
fleet
which
makes
us
have
some
fears
it
being
of
mighty
concernment
to
have
our
supply
of
masts
safe
i
met
with
cade
my
stationer
and
he
tells
me
that
he
hears
for
certain
that
the
is
about
and
hath
near
finished
a
peace
with
france
which
as
a
presbyterian
he
do
not
like
but
seems
to
fear
it
will
be
a
means
to
introduce
popery
to
the
duke
house
to
a
play
it
was
indifferently
done
gosnell
not
singing
but
a
new
wench
that
sings
naughtily
up
and
called
up
by
the
king
trumpets
which
cost
me
by
coach
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
scornful
lady
well
acted
doll
common
doing
abigail
most
excellently
and
knipp
the
widow
very
well
and
will
be
an
excellent
actor
i
think
in
other
parts
the
play
not
so
well
done
as
need
be
by
the
old
actors
this
day
a
house
or
two
was
blown
up
with
powder
in
the
minorys
and
several
people
spoiled
and
manye
dug
out
from
under
the
rubbish
i
to
my
lord
crewe
where
i
find
and
hear
the
news
how
my
lord
brother
nathaniel
crewe
hath
an
estate
of
or
per
annum
left
him
by
the
death
of
as
old
acquaintance
of
his
but
not
akin
to
him
at
all
and
this
man
is
dead
without
will
but
had
above
ten
years
since
made
over
his
estate
to
this
crewe
to
him
and
his
heirs
for
ever
and
given
crewe
the
keeping
of
the
deeds
in
his
own
hand
all
this
time
by
which
if
he
would
he
might
have
taken
present
possession
of
the
estate
for
he
knew
what
they
were
this
is
as
great
an
action
of
confident
friendship
as
this
latter
age
i
believe
can
show
from
hence
to
the
duke
house
and
there
saw
macbeth
most
excellently
acted
and
a
most
excellent
play
for
variety
i
had
sent
for
my
wife
to
meet
me
there
who
did
come
so
i
did
not
go
to
white
hall
and
got
my
lord
bellasses
to
get
me
into
the
playhouse
and
there
after
all
staying
above
an
hour
for
the
players
the
king
and
all
waiting
which
was
absurd
saw
henry
the
fifth
well
done
by
the
duke
people
and
in
most
excellent
habit
all
new
vests
being
put
on
but
this
night
but
i
sat
so
high
and
far
off
that
i
missed
most
of
the
words
and
sat
with
a
wind
coming
into
my
back
and
neck
which
did
much
trouble
me
the
play
continued
till
twelve
at
night
and
then
up
and
a
most
horrid
cold
night
it
was
and
frosty
and
moonshine
called
up
with
news
from
sir
batten
that
hogg
hath
brought
in
two
prizes
more
and
so
i
thither
and
hear
the
particulars
which
are
good
one
of
them
if
prize
being
worth
for
which
god
be
thanked
then
to
the
office
and
have
the
news
brought
us
of
captain
robinson
coming
with
his
fleet
from
gottenburgh
dispersed
though
by
foul
weather
but
he
hath
light
of
five
dutch
and
taken
three
whereof
one
is
sunk
which
is
very
good
news
to
close
up
the
year
with
and
most
of
our
already
heard
of
to
be
safely
come
home
though
after
long
lookings
for
and
now
to
several
ports
as
they
could
make
them
lord
day
to
church
here
was
a
collection
for
the
sexton
but
it
come
into
my
head
why
we
should
be
more
bold
in
making
the
collection
while
the
psalm
is
singing
than
in
the
sermon
or
prayer
to
my
accounts
wherein
at
last
i
find
them
clear
and
right
but
to
my
great
discontent
do
find
that
my
gettings
this
year
have
been
less
than
my
last
it
being
this
year
in
all
but
whereas
the
last
i
got
and
then
again
my
spendings
this
year
have
exceeded
my
spendings
the
last
by
my
whole
spendings
last
year
being
but
whereas
this
year
it
appears
i
have
spent
which
is
a
sum
not
fit
to
be
said
that
ever
i
should
spend
in
one
year
before
i
am
master
of
a
better
estate
than
i
am
yet
blessed
be
god
and
i
pray
god
make
me
thankful
for
it
i
do
find
myself
worth
in
money
all
good
above
which
is
above
more
than
i
was
the
last
year
thus
ends
this
year
of
publick
wonder
and
mischief
to
this
nation
publick
matters
in
a
most
sad
condition
seamen
discouraged
for
want
of
pay
and
are
become
not
to
be
governed
nor
as
matters
are
now
can
any
fleet
go
out
next
year
our
enemies
french
and
dutch
great
and
grow
more
by
our
poverty
the
parliament
backward
in
raising
because
jealous
of
the
spending
of
the
money
the
city
less
and
less
likely
to
be
built
again
every
body
settling
elsewhere
and
nobody
encouraged
to
trade
a
sad
vicious
negligent
court
and
all
sober
men
there
fearful
of
the
ruin
of
the
whole
kingdom
this
next
year
from
which
good
god
deliver
us
one
thing
i
reckon
remarkable
in
my
own
condition
is
that
i
am
come
to
abound
in
good
plate
so
as
at
all
entertainments
to
be
served
wholly
with
silver
plates
having
two
dozen
and
a
half
january
my
wife
up
and
with
mrs
pen
to
walk
in
the
fields
to
themselves
i
find
the
court
full
of
great
apprehensions
of
the
french
who
have
certainly
shipped
landsmen
great
numbers
at
brest
and
most
of
our
people
here
guess
his
design
for
ireland
we
have
orders
to
send
all
the
ships
we
can
possible
to
the
downes
every
day
bringing
us
news
of
new
mutinies
among
the
seamen
so
that
our
condition
is
like
to
be
very
miserable
george
montagu
tells
me
of
the
king
displeasing
the
house
of
commons
by
evading
their
bill
for
examining
accounts
and
putting
it
into
a
commission
though
therein
he
hath
left
out
coventry
and
a
blank
in
the
and
named
all
the
rest
the
parliament
named
and
all
country
lords
not
one
courtier
this
do
not
please
them
he
finds
the
enmity
almost
over
for
my
lord
sandwich
up
to
the
painted
chamber
and
there
heard
a
conference
between
the
house
of
lords
and
commons
about
the
wine
patent
which
i
was
exceeding
glad
to
be
at
because
of
my
hearing
exceeding
good
discourses
but
especially
from
the
commons
among
others
swinfen
and
a
young
man
one
sir
thomas
meres
knight
for
lincoln
made
a
commissioner
of
the
admiralty
and
do
outdo
the
lords
infinitely
alone
to
the
king
house
and
there
saw
the
custome
of
the
country
a
by
beaumont
and
fletcher
the
second
time
of
its
being
acted
wherein
knipp
does
the
widow
well
but
of
all
the
plays
that
ever
i
did
see
the
worst
having
neither
plot
language
nor
any
thing
in
the
earth
that
is
acceptable
only
knipp
sings
a
song
admirably
this
day
i
hear
hath
been
a
conference
between
the
two
houses
about
the
bill
for
examining
accounts
wherein
the
house
of
lords
their
proceedings
in
petitioning
the
king
for
doing
it
by
commission
are
in
great
heat
voted
by
the
commons
after
the
conference
unparliamentary
comes
our
company
to
dinner
my
lord
brouncker
sir
pen
his
lady
and
peg
their
daughter
and
her
servant
lowther
anthony
lowther
of
marske
york
ob
at
night
to
sup
and
then
to
cards
and
last
of
all
to
have
a
flaggon
of
ale
and
apples
drunk
out
of
a
wood
cup
as
a
christmas
draught
which
made
all
merry
and
they
full
of
admiration
at
my
plate
lowther
a
pretty
gentleman
too
good
for
peg
sir
pen
was
much
troubled
to
hear
the
song
i
sung
the
new
droll
it
touching
him
home
with
my
wife
to
the
duke
house
and
there
saw
mustapha
a
tragedy
by
roger
earl
of
orrery
a
most
excellent
play
young
michell
and
i
it
being
an
excellent
frosty
day
did
walk
out
he
showed
me
the
baker
house
in
where
the
late
great
fire
begun
and
thence
all
along
where
i
did
view
several
places
and
so
up
by
london
wall
by
blackfriars
to
ludgate
and
thence
to
bridewell
which
i
find
to
have
been
heretofore
an
extraordinary
good
house
and
a
fine
coming
to
it
before
the
house
by
the
bridge
was
built
lord
brouncker
tells
me
that
my
lady
denham
is
at
last
dead
some
suspect
her
poisoned
but
it
will
be
best
known
when
her
body
is
opened
she
dying
yesterday
morning
the
duke
of
york
is
troubled
for
her
but
hath
declared
he
will
never
have
another
public
mistress
again
which
i
shall
be
glad
of
and
would
the
king
would
do
the
like
he
tells
me
how
the
parliament
is
grown
so
jealous
of
the
king
being
unfayre
to
them
in
the
business
of
the
bill
for
examining
accounts
irish
bill
and
the
business
of
the
papists
that
they
will
not
pass
the
business
for
money
till
they
see
themselves
secure
that
those
bills
will
pass
which
they
do
observe
the
court
to
keep
off
till
all
the
bills
come
together
that
the
king
may
accept
what
he
pleases
and
what
he
pleases
to
object
to
he
tells
me
how
henry
howard
of
norfolke
hath
given
our
royal
society
all
his
library
which
noble
gift
they
value
at
and
gives
them
accommodation
to
meet
in
at
his
house
arundell
house
they
being
now
disturbed
at
gresham
college
to
the
duke
house
and
saw
macbeth
which
though
i
saw
it
lately
yet
appears
a
most
excellent
play
in
all
respects
but
especially
in
divertisement
though
it
be
a
deep
tragedy
which
is
a
strange
perfection
in
a
tragedy
it
being
most
proper
here
and
suitable
in
a
to
white
hall
the
way
being
most
horribly
bad
upon
the
breaking
up
of
the
frost
so
as
not
to
be
passed
almost
i
do
hear
by
my
lord
brouncker
that
for
certain
sir
coventry
hath
resigned
his
place
of
commissioner
up
which
i
believe
he
hath
done
upon
good
grounds
of
security
to
himself
from
all
the
blame
which
must
attend
our
office
this
next
year
but
i
fear
the
king
will
suffer
by
it
thence
to
westminster
hall
and
there
to
the
conference
of
the
houses
about
the
word
nusance
which
the
commons
would
have
and
the
lords
will
not
in
the
irish
bill
the
commons
do
it
professedly
to
prevent
the
king
dispensing
with
it
which
sir
robert
howard
and
others
did
expressly
repeat
often
that
no
king
ever
could
do
any
thing
which
was
hurtful
to
his
people
now
the
lords
did
argue
that
it
was
an
ill
precedent
and
that
which
will
ever
hereafter
be
used
as
a
way
of
preventing
the
king
dispensation
with
acts
and
therefore
rather
advise
to
pass
the
bill
without
that
word
and
let
it
go
accompanied
with
a
petition
to
the
king
that
he
will
not
dispense
with
it
this
being
a
more
civil
way
to
the
king
they
answered
well
that
this
do
imply
that
the
king
should
pass
their
bill
and
yet
with
design
to
dispense
with
it
which
is
to
suppose
the
king
guilty
of
abusing
them
and
more
they
produce
precedents
for
it
namely
that
against
new
buildings
and
about
leather
where
the
word
nusance
is
used
to
the
purpose
and
further
that
they
do
not
rob
the
king
of
any
right
he
ever
had
for
he
never
had
a
power
to
do
hurt
to
his
people
nor
would
exercise
it
and
therefore
there
is
no
danger
in
the
passing
this
bill
of
imposing
on
his
prerogative
and
concluded
that
they
think
they
ought
to
do
this
so
as
the
people
may
really
have
the
benefit
of
it
when
it
is
passed
for
never
any
people
could
expect
so
reasonably
to
be
indulged
something
from
a
king
they
having
already
given
him
so
much
money
and
are
likely
to
give
more
thus
they
broke
up
both
adhering
to
their
opinions
but
the
commons
seemed
much
more
full
of
judgment
and
reason
than
the
lords
then
the
commons
made
their
report
to
the
lords
of
their
vote
that
their
lordships
proceedings
in
the
bill
for
examining
accounts
were
unparliamentary
they
having
while
a
bill
was
sent
up
to
them
from
the
commons
about
the
business
petitioned
his
majesty
that
he
would
do
the
same
thing
by
his
commission
they
did
give
their
reasons
viz
that
it
had
no
precedent
that
the
king
ought
not
to
be
informed
of
any
thing
passing
in
the
houses
till
it
comes
to
a
bill
that
it
will
wholly
break
off
all
correspondence
between
the
two
houses
and
in
the
issue
wholly
infringe
the
very
use
and
being
of
parliaments
thence
to
faythorne
and
bought
a
head
or
two
one
of
them
my
lord
of
ormond
the
best
i
ever
saw
to
arundell
house
where
first
the
royal
society
meet
by
the
favour
of
harry
howard
who
was
there
and
here
was
a
great
meeting
of
worthy
noble
persons
but
my
lord
brouncker
who
pretended
to
make
a
congratulatory
speech
upon
their
coming
hither
and
great
thanks
to
howard
did
do
it
in
the
worst
manner
in
the
world
sir
batten
tells
me
the
lords
do
agree
at
last
with
the
commons
about
the
word
nusance
in
the
irish
bill
and
do
desire
a
good
correspondence
between
the
two
houses
and
that
the
king
do
intend
to
prorogue
them
the
last
of
this
month
sir
coventry
came
to
me
aside
in
the
duke
chamber
to
tell
that
he
had
not
answered
part
of
a
late
letter
of
mine
because
littera
scripta
manet
about
his
leaving
the
office
he
tells
me
it
is
because
he
finds
that
his
business
at
court
will
not
permit
him
to
attend
it
and
then
he
confesses
that
he
seldom
of
late
could
come
from
it
with
satisfaction
and
therefore
would
not
take
the
king
money
for
nothing
i
professed
my
sorrow
for
it
and
prayed
the
continuance
of
his
favour
which
he
promised
i
do
believe
he
hath
acted
like
a
very
wise
man
in
reference
to
himself
but
i
doubt
it
will
prove
ill
for
the
king
and
for
the
office
prince
rupert
i
hear
is
very
ill
yesterday
given
over
but
better
sir
stephen
fox
among
other
things
told
me
his
whole
mystery
in
the
business
of
the
interest
he
pays
as
treasurer
for
the
army
they
give
him
per
pound
quite
through
the
army
with
condition
to
be
paid
weekly
this
he
undertakes
for
his
own
private
credit
and
to
be
paid
by
the
king
at
the
end
of
every
four
months
if
the
king
pay
him
not
at
the
end
of
every
four
months
then
for
all
the
time
he
stays
longer
my
lord
treasurer
by
agreement
allows
him
eight
per
cent
per
annum
for
the
forbearance
so
that
in
fine
he
hath
about
twelve
per
cent
from
the
king
and
the
army
for
fifteen
or
sixteen
months
interest
out
of
which
he
gains
soundly
his
expense
being
about
per
annum
and
hath
no
trouble
in
it
compared
as
i
told
him
to
the
trouble
i
must
have
to
bring
in
an
account
of
interest
talk
there
is
of
a
letter
to
come
from
holland
desiring
a
place
of
treaty
but
i
do
doubt
it
this
day
i
observe
still
in
many
places
the
smoking
remains
of
the
late
fire
the
ways
mighty
bad
and
dirty
this
night
sir
ford
told
me
how
this
day
at
christ
church
hospital
they
have
given
a
living
of
per
annum
to
sanchy
my
old
acquaintance
which
i
wonder
at
he
commending
him
mightily
but
am
glad
of
it
he
tells
me
too
how
the
famous
stillingfleete
was
a
boy
this
morning
come
captain
cocke
to
me
and
tells
me
that
the
king
comes
to
the
house
this
day
to
pass
the
poll
bill
and
the
irish
bill
and
that
though
the
faction
is
very
froward
in
the
house
yet
all
will
end
well
there
but
he
says
that
one
had
got
a
bill
ready
to
present
in
the
house
against
sir
coventry
for
selling
of
places
and
says
he
is
certain
of
it
and
how
he
was
withheld
from
doing
it
he
says
that
the
is
now
one
of
the
greatest
men
in
england
again
and
was
he
that
did
prevail
with
the
king
to
let
the
irish
bill
go
with
the
word
nusance
he
told
me
that
sir
carteret
declaration
of
giving
double
to
any
man
that
will
prove
that
any
of
his
people
have
demanded
or
taken
any
thing
for
forwarding
the
payment
of
the
wages
of
any
man
of
which
he
sent
us
a
copy
yesterday
which
we
approved
of
is
set
up
among
other
places
upon
the
house
of
lords
door
i
do
not
know
how
wisely
this
is
done
sir
pen
told
me
this
night
how
the
king
did
make
them
a
very
sharp
speech
in
the
house
of
lords
saying
that
he
did
expect
to
have
had
more
bills
that
he
purposes
to
prorogue
them
on
monday
come
that
whereas
they
have
unjustly
conceived
some
jealousys
of
his
making
a
peace
he
declares
he
knows
of
no
such
thing
or
treaty
and
so
left
them
but
with
so
little
effect
that
as
soon
as
he
came
into
the
house
sir
coventry
moved
that
now
the
king
hath
declared
his
intention
of
proroguing
them
it
would
be
loss
of
time
to
go
on
with
the
thing
they
were
upon
when
they
were
called
to
the
king
which
was
the
calling
over
the
defaults
of
members
appearing
in
the
house
for
that
before
any
person
could
now
come
or
be
brought
to
town
the
house
would
be
up
yet
the
faction
did
desire
to
delay
time
and
contend
so
as
to
come
to
a
division
of
the
house
where
however
it
was
carried
by
a
few
voices
that
the
debate
should
be
laid
by
but
this
shows
that
they
are
not
pleased
or
that
they
have
not
any
awe
over
them
from
the
king
displeasure
i
was
sorry
to
hear
of
the
heat
the
house
was
in
yesterday
about
the
ill
management
of
the
navy
though
i
think
they
were
well
answered
both
by
sir
carteret
and
sir
coventry
as
he
informs
me
the
substance
of
their
speeches
i
to
church
and
there
beyond
expectation
find
our
seat
and
all
the
church
crammed
by
twice
as
many
people
as
used
to
be
and
to
my
great
joy
find
frampton
in
the
pulpit
and
i
think
the
best
sermon
for
goodness
and
oratory
without
affectation
or
study
that
ever
i
heard
in
my
life
the
truth
is
he
preaches
the
most
like
an
apostle
that
ever
i
heard
man
and
it
was
much
the
best
time
that
ever
i
spent
in
my
life
at
church
to
the
in
the
piazza
to
discourse
with
him
about
two
of
our
prizes
a
cunning
fellow
he
lives
in
one
of
the
great
houses
there
but
and
come
to
us
out
of
bed
in
his
furred
mittins
and
furred
cap
up
to
the
house
and
there
come
mighty
seasonably
to
hear
the
solicitor
about
my
lord
buckingham
pretence
to
the
title
of
lord
rosse
atturny
montagu
is
also
a
good
man
and
so
is
old
sir
ball
sir
peter
bell
the
queen
attorney
but
the
solicitor
and
scroggs
sir
william
scroggs
king
serjeant
and
made
a
judge
after
him
are
excellent
men
this
night
at
supper
comes
from
sir
coventry
the
order
of
councill
for
my
lord
brouncker
to
do
all
the
controller
part
relating
to
the
treasurer
accounts
and
sir
pen
all
relating
to
the
victualler
and
sir
minnes
to
do
the
rest
this
i
hope
will
do
much
better
for
the
king
and
i
think
will
give
neither
of
them
ground
to
me
as
i
feared
they
would
which
pleases
me
mightily
this
evening
wren
and
captain
cocke
called
upon
me
at
the
office
and
there
told
me
how
the
house
was
in
better
temper
and
hath
passed
the
bill
for
the
remainder
of
the
money
but
not
to
be
passed
finally
till
they
have
done
some
other
things
which
they
will
have
passed
with
it
wherein
they
are
very
open
what
their
meaning
is
which
was
but
doubted
before
for
they
do
in
all
respects
doubt
the
pleasing
them
my
lord
brouncker
and
i
walking
into
the
park
i
did
observe
the
new
buildings
and
my
lord
seeing
i
had
a
desire
to
see
them
they
being
the
place
for
the
priests
and
friers
he
took
me
back
to
my
lord
almoner
cardinal
howard
of
norfolk
the
queen
almoner
and
he
took
us
quite
through
the
whole
house
and
chapel
and
the
new
monastery
showing
me
most
excellent
pieces
in
a
crucifix
given
by
a
pope
to
mary
queene
of
scotts
where
a
piece
of
the
cross
is
two
bits
set
in
the
manner
of
a
cross
in
the
foot
of
the
crucifix
several
fine
pictures
but
especially
very
good
prints
of
holy
pictures
i
saw
the
dortoire
dormitory
and
the
cells
of
the
priests
and
we
went
into
one
a
very
pretty
little
room
very
clean
hung
with
pictures
set
with
books
the
priest
was
in
his
cell
with
his
hair
clothes
to
his
skin
with
a
sandall
only
on
and
his
little
bed
without
sheets
and
no
but
yet
i
thought
soft
enough
his
cord
about
his
middle
but
in
so
good
company
living
with
ease
i
thought
it
a
very
good
life
a
pretty
library
they
have
and
i
was
in
the
refectoire
where
every
man
his
napkin
knife
cup
of
earth
and
basin
of
the
same
and
a
place
for
one
to
sit
and
read
while
the
rest
are
at
meals
and
into
the
kitchen
i
went
where
a
good
neck
of
mutton
at
the
fire
and
other
victuals
boiling
i
do
not
think
they
fared
very
hard
their
windows
all
looking
into
a
fine
garden
and
the
park
and
mighty
pretty
rooms
all
i
wished
myself
one
of
the
capuchins
to
the
king
house
and
there
saw
the
humerous
lieutenant
a
by
beaumont
and
fletcher
a
silly
play
i
think
only
the
spirit
in
it
that
grows
very
tall
and
then
sinks
again
to
nothing
having
two
heads
breeding
upon
one
and
then
knipp
singing
did
please
us
here
in
a
box
above
we
spied
pierce
and
going
out
they
called
us
and
so
we
staid
for
them
and
knipp
took
us
all
in
and
brought
to
us
nelly
nell
gwynne
a
most
pretty
woman
who
acted
the
great
part
coelia
very
fine
and
did
it
pretty
well
i
kissed
her
and
so
did
my
wife
and
a
mighty
pretty
soul
she
is
we
also
saw
ball
which
is
my
little
black
girl
that
is
mighty
pretty
she
is
usually
called
betty
knipp
made
us
stay
in
a
box
and
see
the
dancing
preparatory
to
for
the
goblins
a
play
of
suckling
sir
john
suckling
the
poet
not
acted
these
years
which
was
pretty
in
our
way
home
we
find
the
guards
of
horse
in
the
street
and
hear
the
occasion
to
be
news
that
the
seamen
are
in
a
mutiny
which
put
me
into
a
great
fright
company
at
home
amongst
others
captain
rolt
and
anon
at
about
seven
or
eight
comes
harris
of
the
playhouse
and
brings
pierce
with
him
and
also
one
dressed
like
a
with
a
on
and
at
first
i
could
not
tell
who
it
was
though
i
expected
knipp
but
it
was
she
coming
off
the
stage
just
as
she
acted
this
day
in
the
goblins
a
merry
jade
now
my
house
is
full
and
four
fiddlers
that
play
well
harris
i
first
took
to
my
closet
and
i
find
him
a
very
curious
and
understanding
person
in
all
pictures
and
other
things
and
a
man
of
fine
conversation
and
so
is
rolt
among
other
things
harris
sung
his
irish
song
the
strangest
in
itself
and
the
prettiest
sung
by
him
that
ever
i
heard
this
afternoon
i
saw
the
poll
bill
now
printed
wherein
i
do
fear
i
shall
be
very
deeply
concerned
being
to
be
taxed
for
all
my
offices
and
then
for
my
money
that
i
have
and
my
title
as
well
as
my
head
it
is
a
very
great
tax
but
yet
i
do
think
it
is
so
perplexed
it
will
hardly
ever
be
collected
duly
the
late
invention
of
sir
downing
is
continued
of
bringing
all
the
money
into
the
exchequer
this
day
the
house
hath
passed
the
bill
for
the
assessment
which
i
am
glad
of
and
also
our
little
bill
for
giving
any
of
us
in
the
office
the
power
of
justice
of
peace
is
done
as
i
would
have
it
roger
pepys
and
i
to
walk
in
the
pell
mell
i
find
by
him
that
the
house
of
parliament
continues
full
of
ill
humours
and
do
say
how
in
their
late
poll
bill
which
cost
so
much
time
the
yeomanry
and
indeed
of
the
nation
are
left
out
to
be
taxed
walked
to
white
hall
and
there
i
showed
my
cosen
roger
the
duchesse
of
york
sitting
in
state
while
her
own
mother
stands
by
her
and
my
lady
castlemaine
whom
he
approves
to
be
very
handsome
and
wonders
that
she
can
not
be
as
good
within
as
she
is
fair
without
her
little
black
boy
come
by
him
and
a
dog
being
in
his
way
the
little
boy
swore
at
the
dog
how
says
he
blessing
himself
would
i
whip
this
child
till
the
blood
come
if
it
were
my
child
to
westminster
where
i
spent
the
morning
at
the
house
door
to
hear
the
conference
between
the
two
houses
about
my
lord
mordaunt
of
which
there
was
great
expectation
many
hundreds
of
people
coming
to
hear
it
but
when
they
come
the
lords
did
insist
upon
my
lord
mordaunt
having
leave
to
sit
upon
a
stool
uncovered
within
their
barr
and
that
he
should
have
counsel
which
the
commons
would
not
suffer
but
desired
leave
to
report
their
lordships
resolution
to
the
house
of
commons
and
so
parted
for
this
day
which
troubles
me
i
having
by
this
means
lost
the
whole
day
here
i
hear
from
hayes
that
prince
rupert
is
very
bad
still
and
so
bad
that
he
do
now
yield
to
be
trepanned
after
supper
and
reading
a
little
and
my
cutting
off
my
hair
short
which
is
grown
too
long
upon
my
crown
of
my
head
i
to
bed
february
i
am
very
well
pleased
this
night
with
reading
a
poem
i
brought
home
with
me
last
night
from
westminster
hall
of
dryden
upon
the
present
war
a
very
good
poem
to
white
hall
and
there
to
sir
coventry
chamber
and
there
staid
till
he
was
ready
talking
and
among
other
things
of
the
prince
being
trepanned
which
was
in
doing
just
as
we
passed
through
the
stone
gallery
we
asking
at
the
door
of
his
lodgings
and
were
told
so
we
are
full
of
wishes
for
the
good
success
though
i
dare
say
but
few
do
really
concern
ourselves
for
him
in
our
hearts
with
others
into
the
house
and
there
hear
that
the
work
is
done
to
the
prince
in
a
few
minutes
without
any
pain
at
all
to
him
he
not
knowing
when
it
was
done
it
was
performed
by
moulins
having
cut
the
outward
table
as
they
call
it
they
find
the
inner
all
corrupted
so
as
it
come
out
without
any
force
and
their
fear
is
that
the
whole
inside
of
his
head
is
corrupted
like
that
which
do
yet
make
them
afraid
of
him
but
no
ill
accident
appeared
in
the
doing
of
the
thing
but
all
with
all
imaginable
success
as
sir
alexander
frazier
did
tell
me
himself
i
asking
him
who
is
very
kind
to
me
to
sir
carteret
to
dinner
and
before
dinner
he
tells
me
that
he
believes
the
duke
of
york
will
go
to
sea
with
the
fleet
which
i
am
sorry
for
in
respect
to
his
person
but
yet
there
is
no
person
in
condition
to
command
the
fleet
now
the
captains
are
grown
so
great
but
him
by
and
by
to
dinner
where
very
good
company
among
other
discourse
we
talked
much
of
nostradamus
michael
nostradamus
a
physician
and
astrologer
born
in
the
diocese
of
avignon
amongst
other
predictions
he
prophesied
the
death
of
henry
ii
of
france
by
which
the
celebrity
he
had
before
acquired
was
not
a
little
increased
he
succeeded
also
in
rendering
assistance
to
the
inhabitants
of
aix
during
the
plague
by
a
powder
of
his
own
invention
he
died
at
salon
july
his
prophecy
of
these
times
and
the
burning
of
the
city
of
london
some
of
whose
verses
are
put
into
booker
almanack
this
year
john
booker
an
eminent
astrologer
and
master
at
hadley
and
sir
carteret
did
tell
a
story
how
at
his
death
he
did
make
the
town
swear
that
he
should
never
be
dug
up
or
his
tomb
opened
after
he
was
buried
but
they
did
after
sixty
years
do
it
and
upon
his
breast
they
found
a
plate
of
brasse
saying
what
a
wicked
and
unfaithful
people
the
people
of
that
place
were
who
after
so
many
vows
should
disturb
and
open
him
such
a
day
and
year
and
hour
which
if
true
is
very
strange
then
we
fell
to
talk
of
the
burning
of
the
city
and
my
lady
carteret
herself
did
tell
us
how
abundance
of
pieces
of
burnt
papers
were
cast
by
the
wind
as
far
as
cranborne
and
among
others
she
took
up
one
or
had
one
brought
her
to
see
which
was
a
little
bit
of
paper
that
had
been
printed
whereon
there
remained
no
more
nor
less
than
these
words
time
is
it
is
done
away
home
and
received
some
letters
from
sir
coventry
touching
the
want
of
victuals
to
kempthorne
fleet
going
to
the
streights
and
now
in
the
downes
which
did
trouble
me
he
saying
that
this
disappointment
might
prove
fatal
and
the
more
because
sir
coventry
do
intend
to
come
to
the
office
upon
business
morning
and
i
shall
not
know
what
answer
to
give
him
john
kempthorne
a
distinguished
naval
officer
afterwards
knighted
and
made
commissioner
at
portsmouth
which
place
he
represented
in
parliament
ob
vide
some
curious
letters
about
his
election
in
the
correspondence
when
sir
coventry
did
come
and
the
rest
met
i
did
appear
uuconcerned
and
did
give
him
answer
pretty
satisfactory
what
he
asked
me
so
that
i
did
get
off
this
meeting
without
any
ground
lost
soon
as
dined
my
wife
and
i
out
to
the
playhouse
and
there
saw
heraclius
a
tragedy
by
lodowick
carlell
taken
from
corneille
an
excellent
play
to
my
extraordinary
content
and
the
more
from
the
house
being
very
full
and
great
company
among
others
stewart
very
fine
with
her
locks
done
up
with
puffes
as
my
wife
calls
them
and
several
other
great
ladies
had
their
hair
so
though
i
do
not
like
it
but
my
wife
do
mightily
but
it
is
only
because
she
sees
it
is
the
fashion
here
i
saw
my
lord
rochester
and
his
lady
mallett
who
hath
after
all
this
ado
married
him
and
as
i
hear
some
say
in
the
pit
it
is
a
great
act
of
charity
for
he
hath
no
estate
but
it
was
so
pleasant
to
see
how
every
body
rose
up
when
my
lord
john
butler
the
duke
of
son
come
into
the
pit
towards
the
end
of
the
play
who
was
a
servant
to
mallett
and
now
smiled
upon
her
and
she
on
him
home
and
to
my
chamber
and
there
finished
my
catalogue
of
my
books
with
my
heard
this
morning
that
the
prince
is
much
better
and
hath
good
rest
all
the
talk
is
that
my
lord
sandwich
hath
perfected
the
peace
with
spain
which
is
very
good
if
true
sir
cholmly
was
with
me
this
morning
and
told
me
of
my
lord
bellasses
base
dealings
with
him
by
getting
him
to
give
him
great
gratuities
to
near
for
his
friendship
in
the
business
of
the
molle
and
hath
been
lately
underhand
endeavouring
to
bring
another
man
into
his
place
as
governor
so
as
to
receive
his
money
of
sir
cholmly
for
nothing
to
the
king
house
to
see
the
chances
a
comedy
by
the
duke
of
buckingham
a
good
play
i
find
it
and
the
actors
most
good
in
it
and
pretty
to
hear
knipp
sing
in
the
play
very
properly
all
night
i
weepe
and
sung
it
admirably
the
whole
play
pleases
me
well
and
most
of
all
the
sight
of
many
fine
ladies
among
others
my
lady
castlemaine
and
middleton
the
latter
of
the
two
hath
also
a
very
excellent
face
and
body
i
think
and
so
home
in
the
dark
over
the
ruins
with
a
link
to
westminster
hall
and
walked
up
and
down
and
hear
that
the
prince
do
still
rest
well
by
day
and
night
and
out
of
pain
so
as
great
hopes
are
conceived
of
him
though
i
did
meet
clerke
and
pierce
and
they
do
say
they
believe
he
will
not
recover
it
they
supposing
that
his
whole
head
within
is
eaten
by
this
corruption
which
appeared
in
this
piece
of
the
inner
table
to
white
hall
to
attend
the
council
but
they
sat
not
so
to
sir
coventry
chamber
and
find
him
within
and
with
a
letter
from
the
downes
in
his
hands
telling
the
loss
of
the
patricke
coming
from
harwich
in
her
way
to
portsmouth
and
would
needs
chase
two
ships
she
having
the
malago
fireship
in
company
which
from
english
colours
put
up
dutch
and
he
would
clap
on
board
the
and
after
long
dispute
the
admirall
comes
on
the
other
side
of
him
and
both
together
took
her
our
fireship
seely
not
coming
in
to
fire
all
three
but
come
away
leaving
her
in
their
possession
and
carried
away
by
them
a
ship
built
at
bristoll
the
last
year
of
fifty
guns
and
upwards
and
a
most
excellent
good
ship
sir
batten
come
this
morning
from
the
house
where
the
king
hath
prorogued
this
parliament
to
october
next
i
am
glad
they
are
up
the
bill
for
accounts
was
not
offered
the
party
being
willing
to
let
it
fall
but
the
king
did
tell
them
he
expected
it
they
are
parted
with
great
one
party
against
the
other
pray
god
bring
them
hereafter
together
in
better
temper
it
is
said
that
the
king
do
intend
himself
in
this
interval
to
take
away
lord
mordaunt
government
windsor
castle
so
as
to
do
something
to
appease
the
house
against
they
come
together
and
let
them
see
he
will
do
that
of
his
own
accord
which
is
fit
without
their
forcing
him
and
that
he
will
have
his
commission
for
accounts
go
on
which
will
be
good
things
at
dinner
we
talked
much
of
cromwell
all
saying
he
was
a
brave
fellow
and
did
owe
his
crowne
he
got
to
himself
as
much
as
any
man
that
ever
got
one
read
a
piece
of
a
play
every
man
in
his
humour
wherein
is
the
greatest
propriety
of
speech
that
ever
i
read
in
my
life
and
so
to
bed
this
noon
come
my
wife
and
received
of
me
for
her
watch
but
captain
rolt
coming
to
speak
with
me
about
a
little
business
he
did
judge
of
the
work
to
be
very
good
and
so
i
am
well
contented
lord
day
to
church
where
mills
made
an
unnecessary
sermon
upon
original
sin
neither
understood
by
himself
nor
the
people
home
where
come
carter
thomas
carter
my
old
acquaintance
of
magdalene
college
who
hath
not
been
here
of
many
years
he
hath
spent
his
time
in
the
country
with
the
bishop
of
carlisle
much
he
is
grown
a
very
comely
person
and
of
good
discourse
and
one
that
i
like
very
much
we
had
much
talk
of
all
our
old
acquaintance
of
the
college
concerning
their
various
fortunes
wherein
to
my
joy
i
met
not
with
any
that
have
sped
better
than
myself
turner
do
tell
me
very
odde
stories
how
williams
do
receive
the
applications
of
people
and
hath
presents
and
she
is
the
hand
that
receives
all
while
my
lord
do
the
business
with
my
lord
brouncker
by
coach
to
his
house
there
to
hear
some
italian
musique
and
here
we
met
tom
killigrew
sir
robert
murray
and
the
italian
signor
baptista
giovanni
baptista
draghi
an
italian
musician
in
the
service
of
queen
catherine
and
a
composer
of
merit
burney
history
of
music
who
hath
proposed
a
play
in
italian
for
the
opera
which
killigrew
do
intend
to
have
up
and
here
he
did
sing
one
of
the
acts
he
himself
is
the
poet
as
well
as
the
musician
which
is
very
much
and
did
sing
the
whole
from
the
words
without
any
musique
prickt
and
played
all
along
upon
a
harpsicon
most
admirably
and
the
composition
most
excellent
the
words
i
did
not
understand
and
so
know
not
how
they
are
fitted
but
believe
very
well
and
all
in
the
recitative
very
fine
but
i
perceive
there
is
a
proper
accent
in
every
country
discourse
and
that
do
reach
in
their
setting
of
notes
to
words
which
therefore
can
not
be
natural
to
any
body
else
but
them
so
that
i
am
not
so
much
smitten
with
it
as
it
may
be
i
should
be
if
i
were
acquainted
with
their
accent
but
the
whole
composition
is
certainly
most
excellent
and
the
poetry
killigrew
and
sir
murray
who
understood
the
words
did
say
most
excellent
i
confess
i
was
mightily
pleased
with
the
musique
he
pretends
not
to
voice
though
it
be
good
but
not
excellent
this
done
killigrew
and
i
to
talk
and
he
tells
me
how
the
audience
at
his
house
is
not
above
half
so
much
as
it
used
to
be
before
the
late
fire
that
knipp
is
like
to
make
the
best
actor
that
ever
come
upon
the
stage
she
understanding
so
well
that
they
are
going
to
give
her
more
that
the
stage
is
now
by
his
pains
a
thousand
times
better
and
more
glorious
than
ever
heretofore
now
and
many
of
them
then
not
above
lbs
of
tallow
now
all
things
civil
no
rudeness
any
where
then
as
in
a
then
two
or
three
fiddlers
now
nine
or
ten
of
the
best
then
nothing
but
rushes
upon
the
ground
and
every
thing
else
mean
now
all
otherwise
then
the
queene
seldom
and
the
king
never
would
come
now
not
the
king
only
for
state
but
all
civil
people
do
think
they
may
come
as
well
as
any
he
tells
me
that
he
hath
gone
several
times
eight
or
ten
times
he
tells
me
hence
to
rome
to
hear
good
musique
so
much
he
loves
it
though
he
never
did
sing
or
play
a
note
that
he
hath
ever
endeavoured
in
the
late
king
time
and
in
this
to
introduce
good
musique
but
he
never
could
do
it
there
never
having
been
any
musique
here
better
than
ballads
and
says
hermitt
poore
and
chiny
chese
was
all
the
musique
we
had
and
yet
no
ordinary
fiddlers
get
so
much
money
as
ours
do
here
which
speaks
our
rudeness
still
that
he
hath
gathered
our
italians
from
several
courts
in
christendome
to
come
to
make
a
concert
for
the
king
which
he
do
give
to
but
badly
paid
and
do
come
in
the
room
of
keeping
four
ridiculous
gundilows
he
having
got
the
king
to
put
them
away
and
lay
out
money
this
way
and
indeed
i
do
commend
him
for
it
for
i
think
it
is
a
very
noble
undertaking
he
do
intend
to
have
some
times
of
the
year
these
operas
to
be
performed
at
the
two
present
theatres
since
he
is
defeated
in
what
he
intended
in
moorefields
on
purpose
for
it
and
he
tells
me
plainly
that
the
city
audience
was
as
good
as
the
court
but
now
they
are
most
gone
baptista
tells
me
that
giacomo
charissimi
giacomo
chiarissimi
maestro
di
cappella
of
the
church
of
apollinare
in
the
german
college
at
rome
an
excellent
italian
musician
he
lived
to
be
burney
is
still
alive
at
rome
who
was
master
to
vinnecotio
who
is
one
of
the
italians
that
the
king
hath
here
and
the
chief
composer
of
them
my
great
wonder
is
how
this
man
do
to
keep
in
memory
so
perfectly
the
musique
of
the
whole
act
both
for
the
voice
and
the
instrument
too
i
confess
i
do
admire
it
but
in
recitative
the
sense
much
helps
him
for
there
is
but
one
proper
way
of
discoursing
and
giving
the
accents
having
done
our
discourse
we
all
took
coaches
my
lord
and
killigrew
and
to
knipp
chamber
where
this
italian
is
to
teach
her
to
sing
her
part
and
so
we
all
thither
and
there
she
did
sing
an
italian
song
or
two
very
fine
while
he
played
the
bass
upon
a
harpsicon
there
and
exceedingly
taken
i
am
with
her
singing
and
believe
she
will
do
miracles
at
that
and
acting
to
the
duke
of
york
and
there
did
our
usual
business
but
troubled
to
see
that
at
this
time
after
our
declaring
a
debt
to
the
parliament
of
and
nothing
paid
since
but
the
debt
encreased
and
now
the
fleet
to
set
out
to
hear
that
the
king
hath
ordered
but
for
the
setting
out
of
the
fleet
out
of
the
poll
bill
to
buy
all
provisions
when
five
times
as
much
had
been
little
enough
to
have
done
any
thing
to
purpose
they
have
indeed
ordered
more
for
paying
off
of
seamen
and
the
yards
to
some
time
but
not
enough
for
that
neither
a
foul
evening
this
was
and
i
mightily
troubled
to
get
a
coach
home
and
which
is
now
my
common
practice
going
over
the
ruins
in
the
night
i
rid
with
my
sword
drawn
in
the
coach
by
coach
to
my
lord
chancellor
and
there
a
meeting
the
duke
of
york
duke
of
albemarle
and
several
other
lords
of
the
commission
of
tangier
and
there
i
did
present
a
state
of
my
accounts
and
managed
them
well
and
my
lord
chancellor
did
say
though
he
was
in
other
things
in
an
ill
humour
that
no
man
in
england
was
of
more
method
nor
made
himself
better
understood
than
myself
but
going
after
the
business
of
money
was
over
to
other
businesses
of
settling
the
garrison
he
did
fling
out
and
so
did
the
duke
of
york
two
or
three
severe
words
touching
my
lord
bellasses
that
he
would
have
no
governor
come
away
from
thence
in
less
than
three
years
no
though
his
lady
were
with
child
and
says
the
duke
of
york
there
should
be
no
governor
continue
so
longer
than
three
years
and
says
lord
arlington
when
our
rules
are
once
set
and
upon
good
judgment
declared
no
governor
should
offer
to
alter
them
we
must
correct
the
many
things
that
are
amiss
there
for
says
the
lord
chancellor
you
must
think
we
do
hear
of
more
things
amiss
than
we
are
willing
to
speak
before
our
friends
faces
my
lord
bellasses
would
not
take
notice
of
their
reflecting
on
him
and
did
wisely
cholmly
and
i
to
the
temple
and
there
walked
in
the
dark
in
the
walks
talking
of
news
and
he
surprises
me
with
the
certain
news
that
the
king
did
last
night
in
council
declare
his
being
in
treaty
with
the
dutch
that
they
had
sent
him
a
very
civil
letter
declaring
that
if
nobody
but
themselves
were
concerned
they
would
not
dispute
the
place
of
treaty
but
leave
it
to
his
choice
but
that
being
obliged
to
satisfy
therein
a
prince
of
equal
quality
with
himself
they
must
except
any
place
in
england
or
spain
also
the
king
hath
chosen
the
hague
and
thither
hath
chose
my
lord
hollis
and
harry
coventry
to
go
embassadors
to
treat
which
is
so
mean
a
thing
as
all
the
world
will
believe
that
we
do
go
to
beg
a
peace
of
them
whatever
we
pretend
and
it
seems
all
our
court
are
mightily
for
a
peace
taking
this
to
be
the
time
to
make
one
while
the
king
hath
money
that
he
may
save
something
of
what
the
parliament
hath
given
him
to
put
him
out
of
debt
so
as
he
may
need
the
help
of
no
more
parliaments
as
to
the
point
of
money
but
our
debt
is
so
great
and
expence
daily
so
encreased
that
i
believe
little
of
the
money
will
be
saved
between
this
and
the
making
of
the
peace
up
but
that
which
troubles
me
most
is
that
we
have
chosen
a
son
of
secretary
morris
a
boy
never
used
to
any
business
to
go
secretary
to
the
embassy
this
morning
come
up
to
my
wife
bedside
i
being
up
dressing
myself
little
will
mercer
to
be
her
valentine
and
brought
her
name
writ
upon
blue
paper
in
gold
letters
done
by
himself
very
pretty
and
we
were
both
well
pleased
with
it
but
i
am
also
this
year
my
wife
valentine
and
it
will
cost
me
but
that
i
must
have
laid
out
if
we
had
not
been
valentines
pegg
pen
is
married
this
day
privately
no
friends
but
two
or
three
relations
of
his
and
hers
borrowed
many
things
of
my
kitchen
for
dressing
their
dinner
this
wedding
being
private
is
imputed
to
its
being
just
before
lent
and
so
in
vain
to
make
new
clothes
till
easter
that
they
might
see
the
fashions
as
they
are
like
to
be
this
summer
which
is
reason
good
enough
to
my
lord
brouncker
and
there
was
sir
robert
murray
a
most
excellent
man
of
reason
and
learning
and
understands
the
doctrine
of
musique
and
every
thing
else
i
could
discourse
of
very
finely
here
come
hooke
sir
george
ent
wren
and
many
others
and
by
and
by
the
musique
that
is
to
say
signior
vincentio
who
is
the
master
composer
and
six
more
whereof
two
eunuches
so
tall
that
sir
harvy
said
well
that
he
believes
they
do
grow
large
as
our
oxen
do
and
one
woman
very
well
dressed
and
handsome
enough
but
would
not
be
kissed
as
killigrew
who
brought
the
company
in
did
acquaint
us
they
sent
two
harpsicons
before
and
by
and
by
after
tuning
them
they
begun
and
i
confess
very
good
musique
they
made
that
is
the
composition
exceeding
good
but
yet
not
at
all
more
pleasing
to
me
than
what
i
have
heard
in
english
by
knipp
captain
cocke
and
others
their
justness
in
keeping
time
by
practice
much
before
any
that
we
have
unless
it
be
a
good
band
of
practiced
fiddlers
i
find
that
pierce
little
girl
is
my
valentine
she
having
drawn
me
which
i
was
not
sorry
for
it
easing
me
of
something
more
that
i
must
have
given
to
others
but
here
i
do
first
observe
the
fashion
of
drawing
of
mottos
as
well
as
names
so
that
pierce
who
drew
my
wife
did
draw
also
a
motto
and
this
girl
drew
another
for
me
what
mine
was
i
have
forgot
but
my
wife
was
most
courteous
and
most
fair
which
as
it
may
be
used
or
an
anagram
made
upon
each
name
might
be
very
pretty
one
wonder
i
observed
that
there
was
no
musique
in
the
morning
to
call
up
our
people
which
is
very
mean
methinks
staid
till
the
council
was
up
and
attended
the
king
and
duke
of
york
round
the
park
and
was
asked
several
questions
by
both
but
i
was
in
pain
lest
they
should
ask
me
what
i
could
not
answer
as
the
duke
of
york
did
the
value
of
the
hull
of
the
patricke
lately
lost
which
i
told
him
i
could
not
presently
answer
though
i
might
have
easily
furnished
myself
to
answer
all
those
questions
they
stood
a
good
while
to
see
the
ganders
and
geese
in
the
water
at
home
by
appointment
comes
captain
cocke
to
me
to
talk
of
state
matters
and
about
the
peace
who
told
me
that
the
whole
business
is
managed
between
kevet
burgomaster
of
amsterdam
and
my
lord
arlington
who
hath
through
his
wife
there
some
interest
see
note
we
have
proposed
the
hague
but
know
not
yet
whether
the
dutch
will
like
it
or
if
they
do
whether
the
french
will
we
think
we
shall
have
the
help
of
the
information
of
their
affairs
and
state
and
the
helps
of
the
prince
of
orange
his
faction
but
above
all
that
de
witt
who
hath
all
this
while
said
he
can
not
get
peace
his
mouth
will
now
be
stopped
so
that
he
will
be
forced
to
offer
fit
terms
for
fear
of
the
people
and
lastly
if
france
or
spain
do
not
please
us
we
are
in
a
way
presently
to
clap
up
a
peace
with
the
dutch
and
secure
them
but
we
are
also
in
treaty
with
france
as
he
says
but
it
must
be
to
the
excluding
our
alliance
with
the
king
of
spain
or
house
of
austria
which
we
do
not
know
presently
what
will
be
determined
in
he
tells
me
the
is
so
great
with
the
king
that
let
the
duke
of
york
and
sir
coventry
and
this
office
do
or
say
what
they
will
while
the
king
lives
sir
carteret
will
do
what
he
will
and
advises
me
to
be
often
with
him
and
eat
and
drink
with
him
and
tells
me
that
he
doubts
he
is
jealous
of
me
and
was
mighty
mad
at
our
discourse
to
him
before
the
duke
of
york
but
i
did
give
him
my
reasons
that
the
office
is
concerned
to
declare
that
without
money
the
king
work
can
not
go
on
he
assures
me
that
henry
brouncker
is
one
of
the
shrewdest
fellows
for
parts
in
england
and
a
dangerous
man
that
while
we
want
money
so
much
in
the
navy
the
officers
of
the
ordnance
have
at
this
day
good
in
tallies
which
they
can
command
money
upon
that
harry
coventry
who
is
to
go
upon
this
treaty
with
lord
hollis
who
he
confesses
to
be
a
very
wise
man
into
holland
is
a
mighty
quick
ready
man
but
not
so
weighty
as
he
should
be
he
knowing
him
so
well
in
his
drink
as
he
do
that
unless
the
king
do
something
against
my
lord
mordaunt
and
the
patents
for
the
canary
company
before
the
parliament
next
meets
he
do
believe
there
will
be
a
civil
war
before
there
will
be
any
more
money
given
unless
it
may
be
at
their
perfect
disposal
and
that
all
things
are
now
ordered
to
the
provoking
of
the
parliament
against
they
come
next
and
the
spending
the
king
money
so
as
to
put
him
into
a
necessity
of
having
it
at
the
time
it
is
prorogued
for
or
sooner
this
evening
going
to
the
queene
side
to
see
the
ladies
i
did
find
the
queene
the
duchesse
of
york
and
another
or
two
at
cards
with
the
room
full
of
great
ladies
and
men
which
i
was
amazed
at
to
see
on
a
sunday
having
not
believed
it
but
contrarily
flatly
denied
the
same
a
little
while
since
to
my
cosen
roger
pepys
to
the
king
house
to
the
mayd
tragedy
but
vexed
all
the
while
with
two
talking
ladies
and
sir
charles
sedley
yet
pleased
to
hear
their
discourse
he
being
a
stranger
and
one
of
the
ladies
would
and
did
sit
with
her
mask
on
all
the
play
and
being
exceedingly
witty
as
ever
i
heard
woman
did
talk
most
pleasantly
with
him
but
was
i
believe
a
virtuous
woman
and
of
quality
he
would
fain
know
who
she
was
but
she
would
not
tell
yet
did
give
him
many
pleasant
hints
of
her
knowledge
of
him
by
that
means
setting
his
brains
at
work
to
find
out
who
she
was
and
did
give
him
leave
to
use
all
means
to
find
out
who
she
was
but
pulling
off
her
mask
he
was
mighty
witty
and
she
also
making
sport
with
him
very
inoffensively
that
a
more
pleasant
rencontre
i
never
heard
but
by
that
means
lost
the
pleasure
of
the
play
wholly
to
which
now
and
then
sir
charles
exceptions
against
both
words
and
pronouncing
were
very
pretty
they
talked
how
the
king
viallin
bannister
is
mad
that
the
king
hath
a
frenchman
come
to
be
chief
of
some
part
of
the
king
musique
i
with
lord
bellasses
to
lord
chancellor
lord
bellasses
tells
me
how
the
king
of
france
hath
caused
the
stop
to
be
made
to
our
proposition
of
treating
in
the
hague
that
he
being
greater
than
they
we
may
better
come
and
treat
at
paris
so
that
god
knows
what
will
become
of
the
peace
he
tells
me
too
as
a
grand
secret
that
he
do
believe
the
offensive
and
defensive
between
spain
and
us
is
quite
finished
but
must
not
be
known
to
prevent
the
king
of
france
present
falling
upon
flanders
he
do
believe
the
duke
of
york
will
be
made
general
of
the
spanish
armies
there
and
governor
of
flanders
if
the
french
should
come
against
it
and
we
assist
the
spaniard
that
we
have
done
the
spaniard
abundance
of
mischief
in
the
west
indys
by
our
privateers
at
jamaica
which
they
lament
mightily
and
i
am
sorry
for
it
to
have
it
done
at
this
time
by
and
by
come
to
my
lord
chancellor
who
heard
mighty
quietly
my
complaints
for
lack
of
money
and
spoke
mighty
kind
to
me
but
little
hopes
of
help
therein
to
white
hall
and
there
meeting
my
lord
arlington
he
by
i
know
not
what
kindness
offered
to
carry
me
along
with
him
to
my
lord
treasurer
whither
i
told
him
i
was
going
i
believe
he
had
a
mind
to
discourse
of
some
navy
businesses
but
sir
thomas
clifford
coming
into
the
coach
to
us
we
were
prevented
which
i
was
sorry
for
for
i
had
a
mind
to
begin
an
acquaintance
with
him
he
speaks
well
and
hath
pretty
slight
superficial
parts
i
believe
he
in
our
going
talked
much
of
the
plain
habit
of
the
spaniards
how
the
king
and
lords
themselves
wear
but
a
cloak
of
colchester
bayze
and
the
ladies
mantles
in
cold
weather
of
white
flannell
and
that
the
endeavours
frequently
of
setting
up
the
manufactory
of
making
these
stuffs
there
have
only
been
prevented
by
the
inquisition
captain
cocke
did
tell
me
what
i
must
not
forget
that
the
answer
of
the
dutch
refusing
the
hague
for
a
place
of
treaty
and
proposing
boysse
bredah
or
mastricht
was
seemingly
stopped
by
the
swedes
embassador
though
he
did
show
it
the
king
but
the
king
would
take
no
notice
of
it
nor
does
not
from
being
delivered
to
the
king
and
he
hath
wrote
to
desire
them
to
consider
better
of
it
so
that
though
we
know
their
refusal
of
the
place
yet
they
know
not
that
we
know
it
nor
the
king
obliged
to
show
his
sense
of
the
affront
that
the
dutch
are
in
very
great
straits
so
as
to
be
said
to
be
not
able
to
set
out
their
fleet
this
year
by
and
by
comes
sir
robert
viner
and
lord
mayor
sir
william
bolton
to
ask
the
king
direction
about
measuring
out
the
streets
according
to
the
new
act
for
building
of
the
city
wherein
the
king
is
to
be
pleased
but
he
says
that
the
way
proposed
in
parliament
by
colonel
birch
would
have
been
the
best
to
have
chosen
some
persons
in
trust
and
sold
the
whole
ground
and
let
it
be
sold
again
by
them
with
preference
to
the
old
owner
which
would
have
certainly
caused
the
city
to
be
built
where
these
trustees
pleased
whereas
now
great
differences
will
be
and
the
streets
built
by
fits
and
not
entire
till
all
differences
be
decided
this
as
he
tells
it
i
think
would
have
been
the
best
way
i
enquired
about
the
frenchman
that
was
said
to
fire
the
city
and
was
hanged
for
it
by
his
own
confession
that
he
was
hired
for
it
by
a
frenchman
of
roane
and
that
he
did
with
a
stick
reach
in
a
in
at
a
window
of
the
house
whereas
the
master
of
the
house
who
is
the
king
baker
and
his
son
and
daughter
do
all
swear
there
was
no
such
window
and
that
the
fire
did
not
begin
yet
the
fellow
who
though
a
mopish
besotted
fellow
did
not
speak
like
a
madman
did
swear
that
he
did
fire
it
and
did
not
this
like
a
madman
for
being
tried
on
purpose
and
landed
with
his
keeper
at
the
wharf
he
could
carry
the
keeper
to
the
very
house
asking
sir
viner
what
he
thought
was
the
cause
of
the
fire
he
tells
me
that
the
baker
son
and
his
daughter
did
all
swear
again
and
again
that
their
oven
was
drawn
by
ten
at
night
that
having
occasion
to
light
a
candle
about
twelve
there
was
not
so
much
fire
in
the
bakehouse
as
to
light
a
match
for
a
candle
so
that
they
were
fain
to
go
into
another
place
to
light
it
that
about
two
in
the
morning
they
felt
themselves
almost
choked
with
smoke
and
rising
did
find
the
fire
coming
upstairs
so
they
rose
to
save
themselves
but
that
at
that
time
the
bavins
were
not
on
fire
in
the
yard
so
that
they
are
as
they
swear
in
absolute
ignorance
how
this
fire
should
come
which
is
a
strange
thing
that
so
horrid
an
effect
should
have
so
mean
and
uncertain
a
beginning
lay
long
in
bed
talking
with
pleasure
with
my
poor
wife
how
she
used
to
make
coal
fires
and
wash
my
foul
clothes
with
her
own
hand
for
me
poor
wretch
in
our
little
room
at
my
lord
sandwich
for
which
i
ought
for
ever
to
love
and
admire
her
and
do
and
persuade
myself
she
would
do
the
same
thing
again
if
god
should
reduce
us
to
it
at
my
goldsmith
did
observe
the
king
new
medall
where
in
little
there
is
stewart
face
as
well
done
as
ever
i
saw
any
thing
in
my
whole
life
i
think
and
a
pretty
thing
it
is
that
he
should
choose
her
face
to
represent
brittannia
by
this
day
at
a
leisure
the
king
and
duke
of
york
being
gone
down
to
sheerenesse
this
morning
to
lay
out
the
design
for
a
fortification
there
to
the
river
medway
and
so
we
do
not
attend
the
duke
or
york
as
we
should
otherwise
have
done
to
the
dock
yard
and
went
into
pett
and
there
beyond
expectation
he
did
present
me
with
a
japan
cane
with
a
silver
head
and
his
wife
sent
me
by
him
a
ring
with
a
woolwich
stone
now
much
in
request
which
i
accepted
the
values
not
being
great
and
then
at
my
asking
did
give
me
an
old
draught
of
an
ship
given
him
by
his
father
of
the
beare
in
queene
elizabeth
time
hunt
newly
come
out
of
the
country
tells
me
the
country
is
much
impoverished
by
the
greatness
of
taxes
the
farmers
do
break
every
day
almost
and
a
year
become
not
worth
he
told
me
some
ridiculous
pieces
of
thrift
of
sir
downing
who
is
his
countryman
in
inviting
some
poor
people
at
christmas
last
to
charm
the
country
people
mouths
but
did
give
them
nothing
but
beef
porridge
pudding
and
pork
and
nothing
said
all
dinner
but
only
his
mother
would
say
it
good
broth
son
he
would
answer
yes
it
is
good
broth
then
says
his
lady
confirm
all
and
say
yes
very
good
broth
by
and
by
she
would
begin
and
say
good
pork
yes
says
the
mother
good
pork
then
he
cries
yes
very
good
pork
and
so
they
said
of
all
things
to
which
nobody
made
any
answer
they
going
there
not
out
of
love
or
esteem
of
them
but
to
eat
his
victuals
knowing
him
to
be
a
niggardly
fellow
and
with
this
he
is
jeered
now
all
over
the
country
met
cooling
who
tells
me
of
my
lord
duke
of
buckingham
being
sent
for
last
night
by
a
sergeant
at
armes
to
the
tower
for
treasonable
practices
and
that
the
king
is
infinitely
angry
with
him
and
declared
him
no
longer
one
of
his
council
i
know
not
the
reason
of
it
or
occasion
holland
gives
it
me
as
his
opinion
that
the
city
will
never
be
built
again
together
as
is
expected
while
any
restraint
is
laid
upon
them
i
did
within
these
six
days
see
smoke
still
remaining
of
the
late
fire
in
the
city
sir
minnes
this
night
tells
me
that
he
hears
for
certain
that
ballads
are
made
of
us
in
holland
for
begging
of
a
peace
which
i
expected
but
am
vexed
at
so
ends
this
month
with
nothing
of
weight
upon
my
mind
but
for
my
father
and
mother
who
are
both
very
ill
and
have
been
so
for
some
weeks
whom
god
help
but
i
do
fear
my
poor
father
will
hardly
be
ever
naturally
well
again
march
in
i
do
observe
it
being
day
the
picture
of
a
man
dressed
like
a
welchman
hanging
by
the
neck
upon
one
of
the
poles
that
stand
out
at
the
top
of
one
of
the
merchant
houses
in
full
proportion
and
very
handsomely
done
which
is
one
of
the
oddest
sights
i
have
seen
a
good
while
tom
woodall
the
known
chyrurgeon
is
killed
at
somerset
house
by
a
frenchman
in
a
drunken
quarrel
after
dinner
with
my
wife
to
the
king
house
to
see
the
mayden
queene
a
new
play
of
dryden
mightily
commended
for
the
regularity
of
it
and
the
strain
and
wit
and
the
truth
is
there
is
a
comical
part
done
by
nell
which
is
florimell
that
i
never
can
hope
ever
to
see
the
like
done
again
by
man
or
woman
the
king
and
duke
of
york
were
at
the
play
but
so
great
performance
of
a
comical
part
was
never
i
believe
in
the
world
before
as
nell
do
this
both
as
a
mad
girle
then
most
and
best
of
all
when
she
comes
in
like
a
young
gallant
and
hath
the
motions
and
carriage
of
a
spark
the
most
that
ever
i
saw
any
man
have
it
makes
me
i
confess
admire
her
it
is
believed
that
the
dutch
will
yield
to
have
the
treaty
at
london
or
dover
neither
of
which
will
get
our
king
any
credit
we
having
already
consented
to
have
it
at
the
hague
which
it
seems
de
witt
opposed
as
a
thing
wherein
the
king
of
england
must
needs
have
some
profound
design
which
in
my
conscience
he
hath
not
they
do
also
tell
me
that
news
is
this
day
come
to
the
king
that
the
king
of
france
is
come
with
his
army
to
the
frontiers
of
flanders
demanding
leave
to
pass
through
their
country
towards
poland
but
is
denied
and
thereupon
that
he
is
gone
into
the
country
how
true
this
is
i
dare
not
believe
till
i
hear
more
i
walked
into
the
park
it
being
a
fine
but
very
cold
day
and
there
took
two
or
three
turns
the
length
of
the
pell
mell
and
there
i
met
serjeant
bearcroft
who
was
sent
for
the
duke
of
buckingham
to
have
brought
him
prisoner
to
the
tower
he
come
to
town
this
day
and
brings
word
that
being
overtaken
and
outrid
by
the
duchesse
of
buckingham
within
a
few
miles
of
the
duke
house
of
westhorp
he
believes
she
got
thither
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
him
and
so
had
time
to
consider
so
that
when
he
come
the
doors
were
kept
shut
against
him
the
next
day
coming
with
officers
of
the
neighbour
to
force
open
the
doors
they
were
open
for
him
but
the
duke
gone
so
he
took
horse
presently
and
heard
upon
the
road
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
was
gone
before
him
for
london
so
that
he
believes
he
is
this
day
also
come
to
town
before
him
but
no
news
is
yet
heard
of
him
this
is
all
he
brings
thence
to
my
lord
chancellor
and
there
meeting
sir
cholmly
he
and
i
walked
in
my
lord
garden
and
talked
among
other
things
of
the
treaty
and
he
says
there
will
certainly
be
a
peace
but
i
can
not
believe
it
he
tells
me
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
his
crimes
as
far
as
he
knows
are
his
being
of
a
cabal
with
some
discontented
persons
of
the
late
house
of
commons
and
opposing
the
desires
of
the
king
in
all
his
matters
in
that
house
and
endeavouring
to
become
popular
and
advising
how
the
house
should
proceed
and
how
he
would
order
the
house
of
lords
and
that
he
hath
been
endeavouring
to
have
the
king
nativity
calculated
which
was
done
and
the
fellow
now
in
the
tower
about
it
which
itself
hath
heretofore
as
he
says
been
held
treason
and
people
died
for
it
but
by
the
statute
of
treason
in
queen
mary
time
and
since
it
hath
been
left
out
he
tells
me
that
this
silly
lord
hath
provoked
by
his
ill
carriage
the
duke
of
york
my
lord
chancellor
and
all
the
great
persons
and
therefore
most
likely
will
die
he
tells
me
too
many
pratices
of
treachery
against
this
king
as
betraying
him
in
scotland
and
giving
oliver
an
account
of
the
king
private
councils
which
the
king
knows
very
well
and
yet
hath
pardoned
him
to
white
hall
and
here
the
duke
of
york
did
acquaint
us
and
the
king
did
the
like
also
afterwards
coming
in
with
his
resolution
of
altering
the
manner
of
the
war
this
year
that
is
we
shall
keep
what
fleet
we
have
abroad
in
several
squadrons
so
that
now
all
is
come
out
but
we
are
to
keep
it
as
close
as
we
can
without
hindering
the
work
that
is
to
be
done
in
preparation
to
this
great
preparations
there
are
to
fortify
sheerenesse
and
the
yard
at
portsmouth
and
forces
are
drawing
down
to
both
those
places
and
elsewhere
by
the
so
that
we
have
some
fear
of
invasion
and
the
duke
of
york
himself
did
declare
his
expectation
of
the
enemy
blocking
us
up
here
in
the
river
and
therefore
directed
that
we
should
send
away
all
the
ships
that
we
have
to
fit
out
hence
sir
pen
told
me
going
with
me
this
morning
to
white
hall
that
for
certain
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
brought
into
the
tower
and
that
he
hath
had
an
hour
private
conference
with
the
king
before
he
was
sent
thither
every
body
complains
of
the
dearness
of
coals
being
at
per
chaldron
the
weather
too
being
become
most
bitter
cold
the
king
saying
that
it
was
the
coldest
day
he
ever
knew
in
england
thence
by
coach
to
my
lord
crewe
where
very
welcome
here
i
find
they
are
in
doubt
where
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
which
makes
me
mightily
reflect
on
the
uncertainty
of
all
history
when
in
a
business
of
this
moment
and
of
this
day
growth
we
can
not
tell
the
truth
to
devonshire
house
to
a
burial
of
a
kinsman
of
sir
viner
and
there
i
received
a
ring
to
the
duke
playhouse
and
saw
the
english
princesse
or
richard
the
third
a
tragedy
by
j
caryl
a
most
sad
melancholy
play
and
pretty
good
but
nothing
eminent
in
it
as
some
tragedys
are
only
little
miss
davis
did
dance
a
jigg
after
the
end
of
the
play
and
there
telling
the
next
day
play
so
that
it
come
in
by
force
only
to
please
the
company
to
see
her
dance
in
boy
clothes
and
the
truth
is
there
is
no
comparison
between
nell
dancing
the
other
day
at
the
king
house
in
boy
clothes
and
this
this
being
infinitely
beyond
the
other
mary
davis
some
time
a
comedian
in
the
duke
of
york
troop
was
according
to
pepys
natural
daughter
of
the
earl
of
berkshire
she
afterwards
became
the
king
mistress
and
had
by
him
a
child
named
mary
tudor
married
to
francis
ratcliffe
earl
of
derwentwater
whose
son
james
the
earl
was
attainted
and
beheaded
for
high
treason
there
is
a
fine
portrait
of
miss
davis
by
kneller
lately
removed
to
audley
end
from
the
collection
at
billingbear
in
which
she
is
represented
as
a
tall
handsome
woman
and
her
general
appearance
ill
accords
with
time
description
given
of
her
in
the
diary
this
day
was
reckoned
by
all
people
the
coldest
day
that
ever
was
remembered
in
england
and
god
knows
coals
at
a
very
great
price
sir
cholmly
and
i
to
the
temple
and
there
parted
he
telling
me
of
my
lord
bellasses
want
of
generosity
and
that
he
will
certainly
be
turned
out
of
his
government
and
he
thinks
himself
stands
fair
for
it
captain
cocke
who
was
here
did
tell
us
that
he
is
certain
that
yesterday
a
proclamation
was
voted
at
the
council
touching
the
proclaiming
of
my
lord
duke
of
buckingham
a
traytor
and
that
it
will
be
out
on
monday
yesterday
the
king
did
publicly
talk
of
the
king
of
france
dealing
with
all
the
princes
of
christendome
as
to
the
states
of
holland
he
hath
advised
them
on
good
grounds
to
refuse
to
treat
with
us
at
the
hague
because
of
having
opportunity
of
spies
by
reason
of
our
interest
in
the
house
of
orange
and
then
it
being
a
town
in
one
particular
province
it
would
not
be
fit
to
have
it
but
in
a
town
wherein
the
provinces
have
equal
interest
as
at
mastricht
and
other
places
named
that
he
advises
them
to
offer
no
terms
nor
accept
of
any
without
his
privity
and
consent
according
to
agreement
and
tells
them
if
not
so
he
hath
in
his
power
to
be
even
with
them
the
king
of
england
being
come
to
offer
any
terms
he
pleases
and
that
my
lord
albans
is
now
at
paris
plenipotentiary
to
make
what
peace
he
pleases
and
so
he
can
make
it
and
exclude
them
the
dutch
if
he
sees
fit
a
copy
of
this
letter
of
the
king
of
france
the
spanish
ambassador
here
gets
and
comes
and
tells
all
to
our
king
which
our
king
denies
and
says
the
king
of
france
only
uses
his
power
of
saying
anything
at
the
same
time
the
king
of
france
writes
to
the
emperor
that
he
is
resolved
to
do
all
things
to
express
affection
to
the
emperor
having
it
now
in
his
power
to
make
what
peace
he
pleases
between
the
king
of
england
and
him
and
the
states
of
the
united
provinces
and
therefore
that
he
would
not
have
him
to
concern
himself
in
a
friendship
with
us
and
assures
him
that
on
that
regard
he
will
not
offer
anything
to
his
disturbance
in
his
interest
in
flanders
or
elsewhere
he
writes
at
the
same
time
to
spain
to
tell
him
that
he
wonders
to
hear
of
a
league
almost
ended
between
the
crown
of
spain
and
england
by
my
lord
sandwich
and
all
without
his
privity
while
he
was
making
a
peace
upon
what
terms
he
pleased
with
england
that
he
is
a
great
lover
of
the
crown
of
spain
and
would
take
the
king
and
his
affairs
during
his
minority
into
his
protection
nor
would
offer
to
set
his
foot
in
flanders
or
any
where
else
to
disturb
him
and
therefore
would
not
have
him
to
trouble
himself
to
make
peace
with
any
body
only
he
hath
a
desire
to
offer
an
exchange
which
he
thinks
may
be
of
moment
to
both
sides
that
is
that
he
will
enstate
the
king
of
spain
in
the
kingdom
of
portugall
and
he
and
the
dutch
will
put
him
into
possession
of
lisbon
and
that
being
done
he
may
have
flanders
and
this
they
say
do
mightily
take
in
spain
which
is
sensible
of
the
fruitless
expence
flanders
so
far
off
gives
them
and
how
much
better
it
would
be
for
them
to
be
master
of
portugall
and
the
king
of
france
offers
for
security
herein
that
the
king
of
england
shall
be
bond
for
him
and
that
he
will
the
king
of
england
with
amsterdam
and
it
seems
hath
assured
our
king
that
if
he
will
make
a
league
with
him
he
will
make
a
peace
exclusive
to
the
hollander
these
things
are
almost
romantique
but
yet
true
as
sir
cholmly
tells
me
the
king
himself
did
relate
it
all
yesterday
and
it
seems
as
if
the
king
of
france
did
think
other
princes
fit
for
nothing
but
to
make
sport
for
him
but
simple
princes
they
are
that
are
forced
to
suffer
this
from
him
the
proclamation
has
this
day
come
out
against
the
duke
of
buckingham
commanding
him
to
come
in
to
one
of
the
secretaries
or
to
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
a
silly
vain
man
to
bring
himself
to
this
and
there
be
many
hard
circumstances
in
the
proclamation
of
the
causes
of
this
proceeding
of
the
king
which
speak
great
displeasure
of
the
king
and
crimes
of
his
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
concluded
gone
over
sea
and
it
is
thought
to
france
to
my
lord
treasurer
by
and
by
comes
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
presently
the
officers
of
the
ordnance
were
called
my
lord
barkeley
sir
john
duncomb
and
chichly
then
my
lord
brouncker
batten
pen
and
myself
where
we
find
only
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
my
lord
treasurer
and
sir
carteret
when
i
only
did
speak
laying
down
the
state
of
our
wants
which
the
king
and
duke
of
york
seemed
very
well
pleased
with
and
we
did
get
what
we
asked
signed
upon
the
eleven
months
tax
but
that
is
not
so
much
or
what
will
raise
per
week
which
we
desired
and
the
business
will
want
the
king
did
prevent
my
offering
any
thing
by
and
by
as
treasurer
for
tangier
telling
me
that
he
had
ordered
us
on
the
same
tax
but
that
is
not
what
we
would
have
to
bring
our
payments
to
come
within
a
year
so
we
gone
out
in
went
others
viz
one
after
another
sir
stephen
fox
for
the
army
captain
cocke
for
sick
and
wounded
ashburnham
for
the
household
thence
batten
pen
and
i
back
again
i
mightily
pleased
with
what
i
had
said
and
done
and
the
success
thereof
letters
this
day
come
to
court
do
tell
us
that
we
are
likely
not
to
agree
the
dutch
demanding
high
terms
and
the
king
of
france
the
like
in
a
most
braveing
manner
this
morning
i
was
called
up
by
sir
john
winter
poor
man
come
in
a
sedan
from
the
other
end
of
the
town
about
helping
the
king
in
the
business
of
bringing
down
his
timber
to
the
in
the
forest
of
deane
the
weather
is
now
grown
warm
again
after
much
cold
and
it
is
observable
that
within
these
eight
days
i
did
see
smoke
remaining
coming
out
of
some
cellars
from
the
late
great
fire
now
above
six
months
since
i
to
the
duke
of
york
lodging
where
in
his
chamber
he
talking
of
his
journey
or
next
day
to
harwich
to
prepare
some
fortifications
there
so
that
we
are
wholly
upon
the
defensive
part
this
year
i
to
walke
in
the
parke
where
to
the
queene
chapel
and
there
heard
a
fryer
preach
with
his
cord
about
his
middle
in
portuguese
something
i
could
understand
showing
that
god
did
respect
the
meek
and
humble
as
well
as
the
high
and
rich
he
was
full
of
action
but
very
decent
and
good
i
thought
and
his
manner
of
delivery
very
good
then
i
went
back
to
white
hall
and
there
up
to
the
closet
and
spoke
with
several
people
till
sermon
was
ended
which
was
preached
by
the
bishop
of
hereford
herbert
croft
was
made
bishop
of
hereford
but
he
could
not
then
be
very
old
as
he
lived
till
the
bishop
father
was
a
knight
and
his
son
a
baronet
an
old
good
man
that
they
say
made
an
excellent
sermon
he
was
by
birth
a
catholique
and
a
great
gallant
having
per
annum
patrimony
and
is
a
knight
barronet
was
turned
from
his
persuasion
by
the
late
archbishop
laud
he
and
the
bishop
of
exeter
ward
are
the
two
bishops
that
the
king
do
say
he
can
not
have
bad
sermons
from
here
i
met
with
sir
cholmly
who
tells
me
that
undoubtedly
my
lord
bellasses
do
go
no
more
to
tangier
and
that
he
do
believe
he
do
stand
in
a
likely
way
to
go
governor
though
he
sees
and
showed
me
a
young
silly
lord
one
lord
allington
william
baron
allington
of
killard
ireland
created
an
english
peer
which
title
was
extinct
he
was
thrice
married
who
hath
offered
a
great
sum
of
money
to
go
and
will
put
hard
for
it
he
having
a
fine
lady
and
a
great
man
would
be
glad
to
have
him
out
of
the
way
the
king
is
very
kind
to
my
lord
sandwich
and
did
himself
observe
to
him
sir
carteret
how
those
very
people
meaning
the
prince
and
duke
of
albemarle
are
punished
in
the
same
kind
as
they
did
seek
to
abuse
my
lord
sandwich
comes
my
old
good
friend
richard
cumberland
richard
cumberland
educated
at
paul
school
and
magdalene
college
cambridge
made
bishop
of
peterborough
ob
aged
to
see
me
being
newly
come
to
town
whom
i
have
not
seen
almost
if
not
quite
these
seven
years
in
a
plain
dress
i
could
not
spend
much
time
with
him
but
prayed
him
to
come
with
his
brother
who
was
with
him
to
dine
with
me
which
he
did
do
and
i
had
a
great
deal
of
his
good
company
and
a
most
excellent
person
he
is
as
any
i
know
and
one
that
i
am
sorry
should
be
lost
and
buried
in
a
little
country
town
and
would
be
glad
to
remove
him
thence
and
the
truth
is
if
he
would
accept
of
my
sister
fortune
i
should
give
more
with
him
than
to
a
man
able
to
settle
her
four
times
as
much
as
i
fear
he
is
able
to
do
comes
captain
jenifer
to
me
a
great
servant
of
my
lord
sandwich
who
tells
me
that
he
do
hear
for
certain
though
i
do
not
yet
believe
it
that
sir
coventry
is
to
be
secretary
of
state
and
my
lord
arlington
lord
treasurer
i
only
wish
that
the
latter
were
as
fit
for
the
latter
office
as
the
former
is
for
the
former
and
more
fit
than
my
lord
arlington
anon
sir
pen
come
and
talked
with
me
in
the
garden
and
tells
me
that
for
certain
the
duke
of
richmond
is
to
marry
stewart
he
having
this
day
brought
in
an
account
of
his
estate
and
debts
to
the
king
on
that
account
this
day
caesar
told
me
a
pretty
experiment
of
his
of
angling
with
a
minikin
a
string
varnished
over
which
keeps
it
from
swelling
and
is
beyond
any
hair
for
strength
and
smallness
the
secret
i
like
mightily
it
comes
in
my
mind
this
night
to
set
down
how
a
house
was
the
other
day
in
blowed
up
with
powder
a
house
that
was
untenanted
but
thanks
be
to
god
it
did
no
more
hurt
and
all
do
conclude
it
a
plot
this
afternoon
i
am
told
again
that
the
town
do
talk
of
my
lord
arlington
being
to
be
lord
treasurer
and
sir
coventry
to
be
secretary
of
state
and
that
for
certain
the
match
is
concluded
between
the
duke
of
richmond
and
stewart
which
i
am
well
enough
pleased
with
and
it
is
pretty
to
consider
how
his
quality
will
allay
talk
whereas
had
a
meaner
person
married
her
he
would
for
certain
have
been
derided
at
first
dash
to
our
church
to
the
vestry
to
be
assessed
by
the
late
poll
bill
where
i
am
rated
as
an
esquire
and
for
my
office
all
will
come
to
about
but
not
more
than
i
expected
nor
so
much
by
a
great
deal
as
i
ought
to
be
for
all
my
offices
the
duke
of
richmond
and
stewart
were
betrothed
last
night
it
is
strange
how
rycaut
discourse
of
turky
which
before
the
fire
i
was
asked
but
for
there
being
all
but
or
thereabouts
burned
i
did
now
offer
and
he
demands
and
i
think
i
shall
give
it
him
though
it
be
only
as
a
monument
of
the
fire
to
the
duke
of
york
playhouse
where
unexpectedly
i
come
to
see
only
the
young
men
and
women
of
the
house
act
they
having
liberty
to
act
for
their
own
profit
on
wednesdays
and
fridays
this
lent
and
the
play
they
did
yesterday
being
wednesday
was
so
well
taken
that
they
thought
fit
to
venture
it
publickly
day
a
play
my
lord
falkand
henry
carey
third
viscount
falkland
for
arundell
ob
called
the
wedding
night
a
kind
of
a
tragedy
and
some
things
very
good
in
it
but
the
whole
together
i
thought
not
so
i
confess
i
was
well
enough
pleased
with
my
seeing
it
and
the
people
did
do
better
without
the
great
actors
than
i
did
expect
but
yet
far
short
of
what
they
do
when
they
are
there
our
trial
for
a
good
prize
came
on
the
phoenix
worth
or
when
by
and
by
sir
batten
told
me
we
had
got
the
day
which
was
mighty
welcome
news
to
me
and
us
all
but
it
is
pretty
to
see
what
money
will
do
yesterday
walker
sir
w
walker
was
mighty
cold
on
our
behalf
till
sir
batten
promised
him
if
we
sped
in
this
business
of
the
goods
a
coach
and
if
at
the
next
trial
we
sped
for
the
ship
we
would
give
him
a
pair
of
horses
and
he
hath
strove
for
us
like
a
prince
though
the
agent
was
there
with
all
the
vehemence
he
could
to
save
the
goods
but
yet
we
carried
it
against
him
at
the
office
where
sir
pen
come
being
returned
from
chatham
from
considering
the
means
of
fortifying
the
river
medway
by
a
chain
at
the
stakes
and
ships
laid
there
with
guns
to
keep
the
enemy
from
coming
up
to
burn
our
ships
all
our
care
being
now
to
fortify
ourselves
against
their
invading
us
with
sir
carteret
and
sir
minnes
and
they
did
talk
of
my
lord
brouncker
whose
father
it
seems
did
give
ashburnham
and
the
present
lord
digby
the
earl
of
bristol
frequently
called
in
the
diary
lord
digby
long
after
he
had
succeeded
to
the
earldom
to
be
made
an
irish
lord
and
swore
the
same
day
that
he
had
not
left
to
pay
for
his
dinner
they
made
great
mirth
at
this
my
lord
brouncker
having
lately
given
great
matter
of
offence
both
to
them
and
us
all
that
we
are
at
present
mightily
displeased
with
him
by
and
by
to
the
duke
of
york
where
we
all
met
and
there
was
the
king
also
and
all
our
discourse
was
about
fortifying
of
the
medway
and
harwich
which
is
to
be
entrenched
quite
round
and
portsmouth
and
here
they
advised
with
sir
godfrey
lloyd
and
sir
bernard
de
gunn
who
had
been
employed
in
to
construct
the
works
at
dunkirk
the
two
great
engineers
and
had
the
plates
drawn
before
them
and
indeed
all
their
care
they
now
take
is
to
fortify
themselves
and
are
not
ashamed
of
it
for
when
by
and
by
my
lord
arlington
come
in
with
letters
and
seeing
the
king
and
duke
of
york
give
us
and
the
officers
of
the
ordnance
directions
in
this
matter
he
did
move
that
we
might
do
it
as
privately
as
we
could
that
it
might
not
come
into
the
dutch
gazette
presently
as
the
king
and
duke
of
york
going
down
the
other
day
to
sheerenesse
was
the
week
after
in
the
harlem
gazette
the
king
and
duke
of
york
both
laughed
at
it
and
made
no
matter
but
said
let
us
be
safe
and
let
them
talk
for
there
is
nothing
will
trouble
them
more
nor
will
prevent
their
coming
more
than
to
hear
that
we
are
fortifying
ourselves
and
the
duke
of
york
said
further
what
said
marshal
turenne
when
some
in
vanity
said
that
the
enemies
were
afraid
for
they
entrenched
themselves
says
he
would
they
were
not
afraid
for
then
they
would
not
entrench
themselves
and
so
we
could
deal
with
them
the
better
away
thence
and
met
with
sir
cholmly
who
tells
me
that
he
do
believe
the
government
of
tangier
is
bought
by
my
lord
allington
for
a
sum
of
money
to
my
lord
arlington
and
something
to
lord
bellasses
i
did
this
night
give
the
waterman
who
uses
to
carry
me
at
his
request
for
the
painting
of
his
new
boat
on
which
shall
be
my
arms
called
at
lilly
who
was
working
and
indeed
his
pictures
are
without
doubt
much
beyond
hales
i
think
i
may
say
i
am
convinced
but
a
mighty
proud
man
he
is
and
full
of
state
to
the
king
playhouse
and
by
and
by
comes
lowther
and
his
wife
and
mine
and
into
a
box
forsooth
neither
of
them
being
dressed
which
i
was
almost
ashamed
of
sir
pen
and
i
in
the
pit
and
here
saw
the
mayden
queene
again
which
indeed
the
more
i
see
the
more
i
like
and
is
an
excellent
play
and
so
done
by
nell
her
merry
part
as
can
not
be
better
done
in
nature
to
exeter
house
where
the
judge
was
sitting
and
there
heard
our
cause
pleaded
sir
turner
sir
walker
and
sir
ellis
layton
being
our
counsel
against
sir
robert
wiseman
king
advocate
on
the
other
the
second
of
our
three
counsel
was
the
best
and
indeed
did
speak
admirably
and
is
a
very
shrewd
man
nevertheless
as
good
as
he
did
make
our
case
and
the
rest
yet
when
wiseman
come
to
argue
nay
and
though
he
did
begin
so
sillily
that
we
laughed
in
scorn
in
our
sleeves
at
him
he
did
so
state
the
case
that
the
judge
sir
leoline
jenkins
principal
of
jesus
college
oxford
and
afterwards
made
judge
of
the
admiralty
and
the
prerogative
court
he
was
subsequently
employed
on
several
embassies
and
in
succeeded
henry
coventry
as
secretary
of
state
ob
aged
did
not
think
it
to
decide
the
cause
but
took
to
and
did
stagger
us
in
our
hopes
so
as
to
make
us
despair
of
the
success
i
am
mightily
pleased
with
the
judge
who
seems
a
very
rational
learned
and
uncorrupt
man
though
our
success
do
shake
me
to
the
castle
taverne
by
exeter
house
and
there
sir
ellis
layton
whom
i
find
a
wonderful
witty
ready
man
for
sudden
answers
and
little
tales
and
sayings
very
extraordinary
witty
he
did
give
me
a
full
account
upon
my
demand
of
this
judge
of
the
admiralty
judge
jenkins
who
he
says
is
a
man
never
practised
in
this
court
but
taken
merely
for
his
merit
and
ability
sake
from
trinity
hall
where
he
had
always
lived
only
by
accident
the
business
of
the
want
of
a
judge
being
proposed
the
present
archbishop
of
canterbury
sent
for
him
up
and
here
he
is
against
the
gre
and
content
of
the
old
doctors
made
judge
but
is
a
very
excellent
man
both
for
judgment
and
temper
yet
majesty
enough
and
by
all
men
report
not
to
be
corrupted
after
dinner
to
the
court
where
sir
ellis
layton
did
make
a
very
silly
motion
in
our
behalf
but
did
neither
hurt
nor
good
after
him
walker
and
wiseman
and
then
the
judge
did
pronounce
his
sentence
for
some
a
part
of
the
goods
and
ship
and
the
freight
of
the
whole
to
be
free
and
returned
and
paid
by
us
and
the
remaining
which
was
the
greater
part
to
be
ours
the
loss
of
so
much
troubles
us
but
we
have
got
a
pretty
good
part
thanks
be
to
god
received
from
my
brother
the
news
of
my
dying
on
monday
about
five
or
six
in
the
afternoon
and
that
the
last
time
she
spoke
of
her
children
was
on
friday
last
and
her
last
words
were
god
bless
my
poor
sam
the
reading
hereof
did
set
me
heartily
the
great
streets
in
the
city
are
marked
out
with
piles
drove
into
the
ground
and
if
ever
it
be
built
in
that
form
with
so
fair
streets
it
will
be
a
noble
sight
to
a
and
there
bought
two
periwiggs
mighty
fine
indeed
too
fine
i
thought
for
me
but
he
persuaded
me
and
i
did
buy
them
for
the
two
to
the
taverne
whither
was
brought
my
french
gun
and
one
truelocke
the
famous
gunsmith
that
is
a
mighty
ingenious
man
did
take
my
gun
in
pieces
and
made
me
understand
the
secrets
thereof
and
upon
the
whole
i
do
find
it
a
very
good
piece
of
work
and
truly
wrought
but
for
certain
not
a
thing
to
be
used
much
with
safety
and
he
do
find
that
this
very
gun
was
never
yet
shot
off
to
see
the
silly
play
of
my
lady
newcastle
margaret
daughter
of
thomas
lucas
of
colchester
and
sister
to
john
lord
lucas
married
william
marquis
of
newcastle
created
a
duke
called
the
humourous
lovers
the
most
silly
thing
that
ever
came
upon
a
stage
i
was
sick
to
see
it
but
yet
would
not
but
have
seen
it
that
i
might
the
better
understand
her
to
church
and
with
my
mourning
very
handsome
and
new
periwigg
make
a
great
show
walked
to
my
lord
treasurer
where
the
king
duke
of
york
and
the
caball
and
much
company
without
and
a
fine
day
anon
come
out
from
the
caball
my
lord
hollis
and
coventry
third
son
of
thomas
first
lord
coventry
after
the
restoration
made
a
groom
of
the
bedchamber
and
elected
for
droitwich
in
he
was
sent
envoy
extraordinary
to
sweden
where
he
remained
two
years
and
was
again
employed
on
an
embassy
to
the
same
court
in
he
also
succeeded
in
negotiating
the
peace
at
breda
here
alluded
to
and
in
became
secretary
of
state
which
office
he
resigned
in
on
account
of
ill
health
he
died
unmarried
who
it
is
conceived
have
received
their
instructions
from
the
king
this
day
they
being
to
begin
their
journey
towards
their
treaty
at
bredagh
speedily
their
passes
being
come
here
i
saw
the
lady
northumberland
lady
elizabeth
howard
daughter
of
theophilus
earl
of
suffolk
wife
of
algernon
tenth
earl
of
northumberland
and
her
my
lord
daughter
my
lady
piercy
a
beautiful
lady
indeed
lady
elizabeth
wriothesly
daughter
to
the
earl
of
southampton
married
joscelin
lord
percy
the
month
shuts
up
only
with
great
desires
of
peace
in
all
of
us
and
a
belief
that
we
shall
have
a
peace
in
most
people
if
it
can
be
had
on
any
terms
for
there
is
a
necessity
of
it
for
we
can
not
go
on
with
the
war
and
our
masters
are
afraid
to
come
to
depend
upon
the
good
will
of
the
parliament
any
more
as
i
do
hear
april
to
white
hall
and
there
had
the
good
fortune
to
walk
with
sir
coventry
into
the
garden
and
there
read
our
melancholy
letter
to
the
duke
of
york
which
he
likes
and
so
to
talk
and
he
flatly
owns
that
we
must
have
a
peace
for
we
can
not
set
out
a
fleet
and
to
use
his
own
words
he
fears
that
we
shall
soon
have
enough
of
fighting
in
this
new
way
that
we
have
thought
on
for
this
year
he
bemoans
the
want
of
money
and
discovers
himself
jealous
that
sir
carteret
do
not
look
after
or
concern
himself
for
getting
money
and
did
further
say
that
he
and
my
lord
chancellor
do
at
this
very
day
labour
all
they
can
to
vilify
this
new
way
of
raising
money
and
making
it
payable
as
it
now
is
into
the
exchequer
and
that
in
pursuance
hereof
my
lord
chancellor
hath
prevailed
with
the
king
in
the
close
of
his
speech
to
the
house
to
say
that
he
did
hope
to
see
them
come
to
give
money
as
it
used
to
be
given
without
so
many
provisos
meaning
this
new
method
of
the
act
rebecca
allen
poor
heart
come
to
desire
favour
for
her
husband
who
is
clapt
up
being
a
lieutenant
for
sending
a
challenge
to
his
captain
in
the
most
saucy
base
language
that
could
be
writ
i
perceive
sir
coventry
is
wholly
resolved
to
bring
him
to
punishment
for
bear
with
this
says
he
and
no
discipline
shall
ever
be
expected
sir
minnes
did
tell
of
the
discovery
of
his
own
grandfather
murder
fifteen
years
after
he
was
murdered
to
the
duke
of
york
where
sir
carteret
did
say
that
he
had
no
funds
to
raise
money
on
and
being
asked
by
sir
coventry
whether
the
eleven
months
tax
was
not
a
fund
he
answered
no
that
the
banquers
would
not
lend
money
upon
it
then
sir
coventry
burst
out
and
said
he
did
supplicate
his
royal
highness
and
would
do
the
same
to
the
king
that
he
would
remember
who
they
were
that
did
persuade
the
king
from
parting
with
the
to
the
parliament
and
taking
that
in
lieu
which
they
would
certainly
have
given
and
which
would
have
raised
infallibly
meaning
the
bankers
and
the
farmers
of
the
whereof
sir
carteret
i
think
is
one
saying
plainly
that
whoever
did
advise
the
king
to
that
did
as
much
as
in
them
lay
cut
the
king
throat
and
did
wholly
betray
him
to
which
the
duke
of
york
did
assent
and
remembered
that
the
king
did
say
again
and
again
at
the
time
that
he
was
assured
and
did
fully
believe
the
money
would
be
raised
presently
upon
a
this
put
us
all
into
a
stound
and
sir
coventry
went
on
to
declare
that
he
was
glad
he
was
come
to
have
so
lately
concern
in
the
navy
as
he
hath
for
he
can
not
now
give
any
good
account
of
the
navy
business
and
that
all
his
work
now
was
to
be
able
to
provide
such
orders
as
would
justify
his
royal
highness
in
business
when
it
shall
be
called
to
account
and
that
he
do
do
not
concerning
himself
whether
they
are
or
can
be
performed
or
no
and
that
when
it
comes
to
be
examined
and
falls
on
my
lord
treasurer
he
can
not
help
it
whatever
the
issue
of
it
shall
be
one
thing
more
sir
coventry
did
say
to
the
duke
of
york
when
i
moved
again
that
of
about
debt
to
lanyon
at
plymouth
he
might
pay
worth
of
that
he
bought
lately
at
the
candle
out
of
this
debt
due
to
him
from
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
and
sir
carteret
and
lord
barkeley
saying
all
of
them
that
my
lord
ashly
would
not
be
got
to
yield
it
who
is
treasurer
of
the
prizes
sir
coventry
did
plainly
desire
that
it
might
be
declared
whether
the
proceeds
of
the
prizes
were
to
go
to
the
helping
on
of
the
war
or
no
and
if
it
were
how
then
this
could
be
denied
which
put
them
all
into
another
stound
and
it
is
true
god
forgive
us
thence
to
the
chapel
and
there
by
chance
hear
that
crewe
is
to
preach
and
so
into
the
organ
loft
where
i
met
carteret
and
my
lady
jemimah
and
sir
thomas
crewe
two
daughters
and
childe
playing
and
crewe
did
make
a
very
pretty
neat
sober
honest
sermon
and
delivered
it
very
readily
decently
and
gravely
beyond
his
years
so
as
i
was
exceedingly
taken
with
it
and
i
believe
the
whole
chapel
he
being
but
young
but
his
manner
of
his
delivery
i
do
like
exceedingly
his
text
was
but
first
seek
the
kingdom
of
god
and
all
things
shall
be
added
unto
you
the
dutch
letters
are
come
and
say
that
the
dutch
have
ordered
a
passe
to
be
sent
for
our
commissioners
and
that
it
is
now
upon
the
way
coming
with
a
trumpeter
blinded
as
is
usual
but
i
perceive
every
body
begins
to
doubt
the
success
of
the
treaty
all
their
hopes
being
only
that
if
it
can
be
had
on
any
terms
the
chancellor
will
have
it
for
he
dare
not
come
before
a
parliament
nor
a
great
many
more
of
the
courtiers
and
the
king
himself
do
declare
he
do
not
desire
it
nor
intend
but
on
a
strait
which
god
defend
him
from
here
i
hear
how
the
king
is
not
so
well
pleased
of
this
marriage
between
the
duke
of
richmond
and
stewart
as
is
talked
and
that
he
by
a
wile
did
fetch
her
to
the
beare
at
the
where
a
coach
was
ready
and
they
are
stole
away
into
kent
without
the
king
leave
and
that
the
king
hath
said
he
will
never
see
her
more
but
people
do
think
that
it
is
only
a
trick
this
day
i
saw
prince
rupert
abroad
in
the
pretty
well
as
he
used
to
be
and
looks
as
well
only
something
appears
to
be
under
his
periwigg
on
the
crown
of
his
head
i
find
the
duke
of
albemarle
at
dinner
with
sorry
company
some
of
his
officers
of
the
army
dirty
dishes
and
a
nasty
wife
at
table
and
had
meat
of
which
i
made
but
an
ill
dinner
pretty
to
hear
how
she
talked
against
captain
du
tel
the
frenchman
that
the
prince
and
her
husband
put
out
the
last
year
and
how
says
she
the
duke
of
york
hath
made
him
for
his
good
services
his
capbearer
yet
he
fired
more
shot
into
the
ship
and
others
of
the
king
ships
than
of
the
enemy
and
the
duke
of
albemarle
did
confirm
it
and
that
somebody
in
the
fight
did
cry
out
that
a
little
dutchman
by
his
ship
did
plague
him
more
than
any
other
upon
which
they
were
going
to
order
him
to
be
sunk
when
they
looked
and
found
it
was
du
tell
who
as
the
duke
of
albemarle
says
had
killed
several
men
in
several
of
our
ships
he
said
but
for
his
interest
which
he
knew
he
had
at
court
he
had
hanged
him
at
the
without
staying
for
a
one
colonell
howard
at
the
table
magnified
the
duke
of
albemarle
fight
in
june
last
as
being
a
greater
action
than
ever
was
done
by
caesar
the
duke
of
albemarle
did
say
it
had
been
no
great
action
had
all
his
number
fought
as
they
should
have
done
to
have
beat
the
dutch
but
of
his
ships
not
above
fought
he
did
give
an
account
that
it
was
a
fight
he
was
forced
to
the
dutch
being
come
in
his
way
and
he
being
ordered
to
the
buoy
of
the
nore
he
could
not
pass
by
them
without
fighting
nor
avoid
them
without
great
disadvantage
and
dishonour
and
this
sir
carteret
i
afterwards
giving
him
an
account
of
what
he
said
says
that
it
is
true
that
he
was
ordered
up
to
the
nore
but
i
remember
he
said
had
all
his
captains
fought
he
would
no
more
have
doubted
to
have
beat
the
dutch
with
all
their
number
than
to
eat
the
apple
that
lay
on
his
trencher
my
lady
duchesse
among
other
things
discoursed
of
the
wisdom
of
dividing
the
fleet
which
the
generall
said
nothing
to
though
he
knew
well
that
it
come
from
themselves
in
the
fleet
and
was
brought
up
hither
by
sir
edward
spragge
colonell
howard
asking
how
the
prince
did
the
duke
of
albemarle
answering
pretty
well
the
other
replied
but
not
so
well
as
to
go
to
sea
again
how
says
the
duchesse
what
should
he
go
for
if
he
were
well
for
there
are
no
ships
for
him
to
command
and
so
you
have
brought
your
hogs
to
a
fair
market
said
she
it
was
pretty
to
hear
the
duke
of
albemarle
himself
to
wish
that
they
would
come
on
our
ground
meaning
the
french
for
that
he
would
pay
them
so
as
to
make
them
glad
to
go
back
to
france
again
which
was
like
a
general
but
not
like
an
admiral
one
at
the
table
told
an
odd
passage
in
this
late
plague
that
at
petersfield
i
think
he
said
one
side
of
the
street
had
every
house
almost
infected
through
the
town
and
the
other
not
one
shut
up
i
made
sir
carteret
merry
with
telling
him
how
many
we
are
to
have
this
year
allen
at
plymouth
holmes
at
portsmouth
spragge
for
medway
teddiman
at
dover
smith
to
the
northward
and
harman
to
the
southward
with
sir
stephen
fox
talking
of
the
sad
condition
of
the
king
purse
and
affairs
thereby
and
how
sad
the
king
life
must
be
to
pass
by
his
officers
every
hour
that
are
four
years
behind
hand
unpaid
sir
coventry
tells
me
plainly
that
to
all
future
complaints
of
lack
of
money
he
will
answer
but
with
the
shrug
of
the
shoulder
which
methought
did
come
to
my
heart
to
see
him
to
begin
to
abandon
the
king
affairs
and
let
them
sink
or
swim
my
wife
had
been
to
day
at
white
hall
to
the
maunday
it
being
maunday
thursday
but
the
king
did
not
wash
the
poor
feet
himself
but
the
bishop
of
london
did
it
for
him
young
was
talking
about
the
building
of
the
city
again
and
he
told
me
that
those
few
churches
that
are
to
be
new
built
are
plainly
not
chosen
with
regard
to
the
convenience
of
the
city
they
stand
a
great
many
in
a
cluster
about
cornhill
but
that
all
of
them
are
either
in
the
gift
of
the
lord
archbishop
or
bishop
of
london
or
lord
chancellor
or
gift
of
the
city
thus
all
things
even
to
the
building
of
churches
are
done
in
this
world
this
morning
come
to
me
the
collectors
for
my
money
for
which
i
paid
for
my
title
as
esquire
and
place
of
clerk
of
acts
and
my
head
and
wife
servants
and
their
wages
and
though
this
be
a
great
deal
yet
it
is
a
shame
i
should
pay
no
more
that
is
that
i
should
not
be
assessed
for
my
pay
as
in
the
victualling
business
and
tangier
and
for
my
money
which
of
my
own
accord
i
had
determined
to
charge
myself
with
money
till
coming
to
the
vestry
and
seeing
nobody
of
our
ablest
merchants
as
sir
andrew
rickard
a
leading
man
in
the
east
india
company
who
was
committed
in
by
the
house
of
lords
during
their
proceedings
on
the
petition
of
skinner
vide
journals
he
purchased
the
advowson
of
his
parish
olave
hart
street
and
left
it
to
trustees
in
perpetuum
who
still
present
the
rector
he
was
knighted
by
charles
ii
july
to
do
it
i
thought
it
not
decent
for
me
to
do
it
to
white
hall
and
there
saw
the
king
come
out
of
chapel
after
prayers
in
the
afternoon
which
he
is
never
at
but
after
having
received
the
sacrament
and
the
court
i
perceive
is
quite
out
of
mourning
and
some
very
fine
among
others
my
lord
gerard
in
a
very
rich
vest
and
coate
here
i
met
with
my
lord
bellasses
and
it
is
pretty
to
see
what
a
formal
story
he
tells
me
of
his
leaving
his
place
upon
the
death
of
my
lord
cleveland
thomas
wentworth
earl
of
cleveland
by
which
he
is
become
captain
of
the
pensioners
and
that
the
king
did
leave
it
to
him
to
keep
the
other
or
take
this
whereas
i
know
the
contrary
that
they
had
a
mind
to
have
him
away
from
tangier
into
and
did
find
houses
built
two
stories
high
and
like
to
stand
and
must
become
a
place
of
great
trade
till
the
city
be
built
and
the
street
is
already
paved
as
london
streets
used
to
be
away
to
the
temple
to
my
new
bookseller
and
there
i
did
agree
for
rycaut
this
book
is
in
the
pepysian
library
late
history
of
the
turkish
policy
which
cost
me
whereas
it
was
sold
plain
before
the
late
fire
for
and
bound
and
coloured
as
this
is
for
for
i
have
bought
it
finely
bound
and
truly
coloured
all
the
figures
of
which
there
was
but
six
books
done
so
whereof
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
duke
of
monmouth
and
lord
arlington
had
four
the
fifth
was
sold
and
i
have
bought
the
sixth
towards
noon
i
to
the
exchange
and
there
do
hear
mighty
cries
for
peace
and
that
otherwise
we
shall
be
undone
and
yet
do
suspect
the
badness
of
the
peace
we
shall
make
several
do
complain
of
abundance
of
land
flung
up
by
tenants
out
of
their
hands
for
want
of
ability
to
pay
their
rents
and
by
name
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
hath
so
flung
up
and
my
father
writes
that
jasper
trice
upon
this
pretence
of
his
dealing
with
him
is
broke
up
and
gone
to
board
with
his
brother
naylor
at
offord
which
is
very
sad
to
the
king
house
and
there
saw
the
tameing
of
a
shrew
which
hath
some
very
good
pieces
in
it
but
generally
is
but
a
mean
play
and
the
best
part
sawny
done
by
lucy
and
hath
not
half
its
life
by
reason
of
the
words
i
suppose
not
being
understood
at
least
by
me
i
began
to
discourse
with
sir
coventry
the
business
of
tangier
which
by
the
removal
of
my
lord
bellasses
is
now
to
have
a
new
governor
and
did
move
him
that
at
this
season
all
the
business
of
reforming
the
garrison
might
be
considered
while
nobody
was
to
be
offended
and
i
told
him
it
is
plain
that
we
do
overspend
our
revenue
that
it
is
of
no
more
profit
to
the
king
than
it
was
the
first
day
nor
in
itself
of
better
credit
no
more
people
of
condition
willing
to
live
there
nor
any
thing
like
a
place
likely
to
turn
his
majesty
to
account
that
it
hath
been
hitherto
and
for
aught
i
see
likely
only
to
be
used
as
a
jobb
to
do
a
kindness
to
some
lord
or
he
that
can
get
to
be
governor
sir
coventry
agreed
with
me
so
as
to
say
that
unless
the
king
hath
the
wealth
of
the
mogull
he
would
be
a
beggar
to
have
his
businesses
ordered
in
the
manner
they
now
are
that
his
garrison
must
be
made
places
only
of
convenience
to
particular
persons
that
he
hath
moved
the
duke
of
york
in
it
and
that
it
was
resolved
to
send
no
governor
thither
till
there
had
been
commissioners
sent
to
put
the
garrison
in
order
so
as
that
he
that
goes
may
go
with
limitations
and
rules
to
follow
and
not
to
do
as
he
please
as
the
rest
have
hitherto
done
that
he
is
not
afraid
to
speak
his
mind
though
to
the
displeasure
of
any
man
and
that
i
know
well
enough
but
that
when
it
is
come
as
it
is
now
that
to
speak
the
truth
in
behalf
of
the
king
plainly
do
no
good
but
all
things
bore
down
by
other
measures
than
by
what
is
best
for
the
king
he
hath
no
temptation
to
be
perpetually
fighting
of
battles
it
being
more
easy
to
him
on
those
terms
to
suffer
things
to
go
on
without
giving
any
man
offence
than
to
have
the
same
thing
done
and
he
contract
the
displeasure
of
all
the
world
as
he
must
do
that
will
be
for
the
king
to
the
king
little
chapel
and
afterwards
to
see
the
king
heal
the
king
evil
wherein
no
pleasure
i
having
seen
it
before
and
then
to
see
him
and
the
queene
and
duke
of
york
and
his
wife
at
dinner
in
the
queene
lodgings
and
so
with
sir
carteret
to
his
lodgings
to
dinner
where
very
good
company
and
after
dinner
he
and
i
to
talk
alone
how
things
are
managed
and
to
what
ruin
we
must
come
if
we
have
not
a
peace
he
did
tell
me
one
occasion
how
sir
thomas
allen
whom
i
took
for
a
man
of
known
courage
and
service
on
the
king
side
was
tried
for
his
life
in
prince
rupert
fleet
in
the
late
times
for
cowardice
and
condemned
to
be
hanged
and
fled
to
jerzy
where
sir
carteret
received
him
not
knowing
the
reason
of
his
coming
thither
and
that
thereupon
prince
rupert
wrote
to
the
mother
his
dislike
of
sir
carteret
receiving
a
person
that
stood
condemned
and
so
sir
carteret
was
forced
to
bid
him
betake
himself
to
some
other
place
this
was
strange
to
me
our
commissioners
are
preparing
to
go
to
bredah
to
the
treaty
and
do
design
to
be
going
the
next
week
to
white
hall
thinking
there
to
have
seen
the
duchesse
of
newcastle
coming
this
night
to
court
to
make
a
visit
to
the
queene
the
king
having
been
with
her
yesterday
to
make
her
a
visit
since
her
coming
to
town
the
whole
story
of
this
lady
is
a
romance
and
all
she
does
is
romantic
her
footmen
in
velvet
coats
and
herself
in
an
antique
dress
as
they
say
and
was
the
other
day
at
her
own
play
the
humourous
lovers
the
most
ridiculous
thing
that
ever
was
wrote
but
yet
she
and
her
lord
mightily
pleased
with
it
and
she
at
the
end
made
her
respects
to
the
players
from
her
box
and
did
give
them
thanks
there
is
as
much
expectation
of
her
coming
to
court
that
so
people
may
come
to
see
her
as
if
it
were
the
queene
of
sweden
but
i
lost
my
labour
for
she
did
not
come
this
night
there
have
been
two
fires
in
the
city
within
this
week
by
water
to
white
hall
and
there
did
our
usual
business
before
the
duke
of
york
but
it
fell
out
that
discoursing
of
matters
of
money
it
rose
to
a
mighty
heat
very
high
words
arising
between
sir
carteret
and
sir
coventry
the
former
in
his
passion
saying
that
the
other
should
have
helped
things
if
they
were
so
bad
and
the
other
answered
so
he
would
and
things
should
have
been
better
had
he
been
treasurer
of
the
navy
i
was
mightily
troubled
at
this
heat
and
it
will
breed
ill
blood
between
them
i
fear
but
things
are
in
that
bad
condition
that
i
do
daily
expect
we
shall
all
fly
in
one
another
faces
when
we
shall
be
reduced
every
one
to
answer
for
himself
we
broke
up
and
i
soon
after
to
sir
carteret
chamber
where
i
find
the
poor
man
telling
his
lady
privately
and
she
weeping
i
went
in
to
them
and
did
seem
as
indeed
i
was
troubled
for
this
and
did
give
the
best
advice
i
could
which
i
think
did
please
them
and
they
do
apprehend
me
their
friend
as
indeed
i
am
for
i
do
take
the
for
a
most
honest
man
he
did
assure
me
that
he
was
not
all
expences
and
things
paid
clear
in
estate
better
than
he
was
when
the
king
come
in
and
that
the
king
and
lord
chancellor
did
know
that
he
was
worth
with
the
debt
the
king
owed
him
i
think
he
said
when
the
king
come
into
england
called
up
by
sir
cholmly
who
tells
me
that
my
lord
middleton
john
first
earl
of
middleton
in
scotland
is
for
certain
chosen
governor
of
tangier
a
man
of
moderate
understanding
not
covetous
but
a
soldier
of
fortune
and
poor
to
the
king
house
by
chance
where
a
new
play
so
full
as
i
never
saw
it
i
forced
to
stand
all
the
while
close
to
the
very
door
till
i
took
cold
and
many
people
went
away
for
want
of
room
the
king
and
queene
and
duke
of
york
and
duchesse
there
and
all
the
court
and
sir
coventry
the
play
called
the
change
of
crownes
a
play
of
ned
howard
a
younger
son
of
the
earl
of
berkshire
and
brother
to
sir
robert
howard
the
best
that
i
ever
saw
at
that
house
being
a
great
play
and
serious
only
lacy
did
act
the
come
up
to
court
who
do
abuse
the
court
with
all
the
imaginable
wit
and
plainness
about
selling
of
places
and
doing
every
thing
for
money
the
play
took
very
much
thence
i
to
my
new
bookseller
and
there
bought
hooker
polity
the
new
edition
and
dugdale
history
of
the
inns
of
court
of
which
there
was
but
a
few
saved
out
of
the
fire
carried
my
wife
to
see
the
new
play
i
saw
yesterday
but
there
contrary
to
expectation
i
find
the
silent
woman
knipp
tells
me
the
king
was
so
angry
at
the
liberty
taken
by
lacy
part
to
abuse
him
to
his
face
that
he
commanded
they
should
act
no
more
till
moone
michael
mohun
a
celebrated
actor
belonging
to
the
king
company
he
had
served
as
a
major
in
the
royal
army
went
and
got
leave
for
them
to
act
again
but
not
this
play
the
king
mighty
angry
and
it
was
bitter
indeed
but
very
fine
and
witty
i
never
was
more
taken
with
a
play
than
i
am
with
this
silent
woman
as
old
as
it
is
and
as
often
as
i
have
seen
it
there
is
more
wit
in
it
than
goes
to
ten
new
plays
pierce
told
us
the
story
how
in
good
earnest
the
king
is
offended
with
the
duke
of
richmond
marrying
and
stewart
sending
the
king
his
jewels
again
as
she
tells
it
it
is
the
noblest
romance
and
example
of
a
brave
lady
that
ever
i
read
in
my
life
in
our
way
in
we
saw
desbrough
john
desborough
cromwell
and
one
of
his
councii
of
state
afterwards
promoted
to
the
chancellorship
of
ireland
by
his
nephew
richard
walking
on
foot
who
is
now
no
more
a
prisoner
and
looks
well
and
just
as
he
used
to
do
heretofore
some
talk
about
sir
pen
being
to
buy
of
sir
robert
brookes
met
rolt
who
tells
me
the
reason
of
no
play
today
at
the
king
house
that
lacy
had
been
committed
to
the
lodge
for
his
acting
his
part
in
the
late
new
play
and
being
thence
released
to
come
to
the
king
house
he
there
met
with
ned
howard
the
poet
of
the
play
who
congratulated
his
release
upon
which
lacy
cursed
him
as
that
it
was
the
fault
of
his
nonsensical
play
that
was
the
cause
of
his
ill
usage
howard
did
give
him
some
reply
to
which
lacy
answered
him
that
he
was
more
a
fool
than
a
poet
upon
which
howard
did
give
him
a
blow
on
the
face
with
his
glove
on
which
lacy
having
a
cane
in
his
hand
did
give
him
a
blow
over
the
pate
here
rolt
and
others
that
discoursed
of
it
in
the
pit
this
afternoon
did
wonder
that
howard
did
not
run
him
through
he
being
too
mean
a
fellow
to
fight
with
but
howard
did
not
do
any
thing
but
complain
to
the
king
of
it
so
the
whole
house
is
silenced
and
the
gentry
seem
to
rejoice
much
at
it
the
house
being
become
too
insolent
i
have
a
mind
to
buy
enough
ground
to
build
a
and
stable
for
i
have
had
it
much
in
my
thoughts
lately
that
it
is
not
too
much
for
me
now
in
degree
or
cost
to
keep
a
coach
but
contrarily
that
i
am
almost
ashamed
to
be
seen
in
a
hackney
to
hackney
church
a
knight
and
his
lady
very
civil
to
me
when
they
came
being
sir
george
viner
and
his
lady
in
rich
jewells
but
most
in
beauty
almost
the
finest
woman
that
ever
i
saw
that
which
i
went
chiefly
to
see
was
the
young
ladies
of
the
schools
whereof
there
is
great
store
very
pretty
and
also
the
organ
which
is
handsome
and
tunes
the
psalm
and
plays
with
the
people
which
is
mighty
pretty
and
makes
me
mighty
earnest
to
have
a
pair
at
our
church
i
having
almost
a
mind
to
give
them
a
pair
if
they
would
settle
a
maintenance
on
them
for
it
to
the
lord
chancellor
house
the
first
time
i
have
been
therein
and
it
is
very
noble
and
brave
pictures
of
the
ancient
and
present
nobility
the
king
was
vexed
the
other
day
for
having
no
paper
laid
for
him
at
the
council
table
as
was
usual
and
sir
richard
browne
did
tell
his
majesty
he
would
call
the
person
whose
work
it
was
to
provide
it
who
being
come
did
tell
his
majesty
that
he
was
but
a
poor
man
and
was
out
or
for
it
which
was
as
much
as
he
is
worth
and
that
he
can
not
provide
it
any
longer
without
money
having
not
received
a
penny
since
the
king
coming
in
so
the
king
spoke
to
my
lord
chamberlain
and
many
such
mementos
the
king
do
meet
withall
enough
to
make
an
ingenuous
man
mad
the
feast
being
kept
at
white
hall
out
of
design
as
it
is
thought
to
make
the
best
coutenance
we
can
to
the
swede
embassadors
before
their
leaving
us
to
go
to
the
treaty
abroad
to
show
some
jollity
to
sir
john
duncomb
lodging
in
the
pell
mell
in
order
to
the
money
spoken
of
in
the
morning
and
there
awhile
sat
and
discoursed
and
i
find
that
he
is
a
very
proper
man
for
business
being
very
resolute
and
proud
and
industrious
he
told
me
what
reformation
they
had
made
in
the
office
of
the
ordnance
taking
away
legg
fees
have
got
an
order
that
no
treasurer
after
him
shall
ever
sit
at
the
board
and
it
is
a
good
one
that
no
master
of
the
ordnance
here
shall
ever
sell
a
place
he
tells
me
they
have
not
paid
any
increase
of
price
for
any
thing
during
this
war
but
in
most
have
paid
less
and
at
this
day
have
greater
stores
than
they
know
where
to
lay
if
there
should
be
peace
and
than
ever
was
any
time
this
war
then
to
talk
of
news
that
he
thinks
the
want
of
money
hath
undone
the
king
for
the
parliament
will
never
give
the
king
more
money
without
calling
all
people
to
account
nor
as
he
believes
will
ever
make
war
again
but
they
will
manage
it
themselves
unless
which
i
proposed
he
would
visibly
become
a
severer
inspector
into
his
own
business
and
accounts
and
that
would
gain
upon
the
parliament
yet
which
he
confesses
and
confirms
as
the
only
lift
to
set
him
upon
his
legs
but
says
that
it
is
not
in
his
nature
ever
to
do
he
thinks
that
much
of
our
misfortune
hath
been
for
want
of
an
active
lord
treasurer
and
that
such
a
man
as
sir
coventry
would
do
the
business
thoroughly
to
white
hall
and
there
saw
the
duke
of
albemarle
who
is
not
well
and
do
grow
crazy
while
i
was
waiting
in
the
matted
gallery
a
young
man
was
working
in
indian
inke
the
great
picture
of
the
king
and
queene
sitting
by
van
dike
and
did
it
very
finely
then
i
took
a
turn
with
evelyn
with
whom
i
walked
two
hours
till
almost
one
of
the
clock
talking
of
the
badness
of
the
government
where
nothing
but
wickedness
and
wicked
men
and
women
command
the
king
that
it
is
not
in
his
nature
to
gainsay
any
thing
that
relates
to
his
pleasures
that
much
of
it
arises
from
the
sickliness
of
our
ministers
of
state
who
can
not
be
about
him
as
the
idle
companions
are
and
therefore
he
gives
way
to
the
young
rogues
and
then
from
the
negligence
of
the
clergy
that
a
bishop
shall
never
be
seen
about
him
as
the
king
of
france
hath
always
that
the
king
would
fain
have
some
of
the
same
gang
to
be
lord
treasurer
which
would
be
yet
worse
for
now
some
delays
are
put
to
the
getting
gifts
of
the
king
as
lady
byron
eleanor
daughter
of
robert
needham
viscount
kilmurrey
and
widow
of
peter
warburton
became
in
the
second
wife
of
richard
first
lord
byron
ob
who
had
been
as
he
called
it
the
king
seventeenth
mistress
abroad
did
not
leave
him
till
she
had
got
him
to
give
her
an
order
for
worth
of
plate
to
be
made
for
her
but
by
delays
thanks
be
to
god
she
died
before
she
had
it
he
confirmed
to
me
the
business
of
the
want
of
paper
at
the
council
table
the
other
day
which
i
have
observed
wooly
being
to
have
found
it
and
did
being
called
tell
the
king
to
his
face
the
reason
of
it
and
elvelyn
tells
me
of
several
of
the
menial
servants
of
the
court
lacking
bread
that
have
not
received
a
farthing
wages
since
the
king
coming
in
he
tells
me
the
king
of
france
hath
his
mistresses
but
laughs
at
the
foolery
of
our
king
that
makes
his
bastards
princes
and
loses
his
revenue
upon
them
and
makes
his
mistresses
his
masters
and
the
king
of
france
did
never
grant
lavaliere
any
thing
to
bestow
on
others
and
gives
a
little
subsistence
but
no
more
to
his
bastards
we
told
me
the
whole
story
of
stewart
going
away
from
court
he
knowing
her
well
and
believes
her
up
to
her
leaving
the
court
to
be
as
virtuous
as
any
woman
in
the
world
and
told
me
from
a
lord
that
she
told
it
to
but
yesterday
with
her
own
mouth
and
a
sober
man
that
when
the
duke
of
richmond
did
make
love
to
her
she
did
ask
the
king
and
he
did
the
like
also
and
that
the
king
did
not
deny
it
and
told
this
lord
that
she
was
come
to
that
pass
as
to
resolve
to
have
married
any
gentleman
of
that
would
have
had
her
in
honour
for
it
was
come
to
that
pass
that
she
could
not
longer
continue
at
court
without
prostituting
herself
to
the
king
whom
she
had
so
long
kept
off
though
he
had
liberty
more
than
any
other
had
or
he
ought
to
have
as
to
dalliance
she
told
this
lord
that
she
had
reflected
upon
the
occasion
she
had
given
the
world
to
think
her
a
bad
woman
and
that
she
had
no
way
but
to
marry
and
leave
the
court
rather
in
this
way
of
discontent
than
otherwise
that
the
world
might
see
that
she
sought
not
any
thing
but
her
honour
and
that
she
will
never
come
to
live
at
court
more
than
when
she
comes
to
town
to
kiss
the
queene
her
mistress
hand
and
hopes
though
she
hath
little
reason
to
hope
she
can
please
her
lord
so
as
to
reclaim
him
that
they
may
yet
live
comfortably
in
the
country
on
his
estate
she
told
this
lord
that
all
the
jewells
she
ever
had
given
her
at
court
or
any
other
presents
more
than
the
king
allowance
of
per
annum
out
of
the
for
her
clothes
were
at
her
first
coming
the
king
did
give
her
a
necklace
of
pearl
of
about
and
afterwards
about
seven
months
since
when
the
king
had
hopes
to
have
obtained
some
courtesy
of
her
the
king
did
give
her
some
jewells
i
have
forgot
what
and
i
think
a
pair
of
pendants
the
duke
of
york
being
once
her
valentine
did
give
her
a
jewell
of
about
and
my
lord
mandeville
her
valentine
this
year
a
ring
of
about
and
the
king
of
france
would
have
had
her
mother
who
he
says
was
one
of
the
most
cunning
women
in
the
world
to
have
let
her
stay
in
france
saying
that
he
loved
her
not
as
a
mistress
but
as
one
that
he
could
marry
as
well
as
any
lady
in
france
and
that
if
she
might
stay
for
the
honour
of
his
court
he
would
take
care
she
should
not
repent
but
her
mother
by
command
of
the
thought
rather
to
bring
her
into
england
and
the
king
of
france
did
give
her
a
jewell
so
that
evelyn
believes
she
may
be
worth
in
jewells
about
and
that
is
all
she
hath
in
the
world
and
a
worthy
woman
and
in
this
hath
done
as
great
an
act
of
honour
as
ever
was
done
by
woman
that
now
the
countesse
castlemaine
do
carry
all
before
her
and
among
other
arguments
to
prove
stewart
to
have
been
honest
to
the
last
he
says
that
the
king
keeping
in
still
with
my
lady
castlemaine
do
show
it
for
he
never
was
known
to
keep
two
mistresses
in
his
life
and
would
never
have
kept
to
her
had
he
prevailed
any
thing
with
stewart
she
is
gone
yesterday
with
her
lord
to
cobham
he
did
tell
me
of
the
ridiculous
humour
of
our
king
and
knights
of
the
garter
the
other
day
who
whereas
heretofore
their
robes
were
only
to
be
worn
during
their
ceremonies
and
service
these
as
proud
of
their
coats
did
wear
them
all
day
till
night
and
then
rode
into
the
park
with
them
on
nay
and
he
tells
me
he
did
see
my
lord
oxford
and
duke
of
monmouth
in
a
with
two
footmen
in
the
park
with
their
robes
on
which
is
a
most
scandalous
thing
so
as
all
gravity
may
be
said
to
be
lost
among
us
by
and
by
we
discoursed
of
sir
thomas
clifford
whom
i
took
for
a
very
rich
and
learned
man
and
of
the
great
family
of
that
name
he
tells
me
he
is
only
a
man
of
about
pounds
of
little
learning
more
than
the
law
of
a
justice
of
peace
which
he
knows
well
a
parson
son
collins
states
that
sir
thomas
clifford
father
was
a
colonel
in
the
army
during
the
scotch
rebellion
and
died
the
same
year
on
his
return
from
the
northern
march
got
to
be
burgess
in
a
little
borough
in
the
west
and
here
fell
into
the
acquaintance
of
my
lord
arlington
whose
creature
he
is
and
never
from
him
a
man
of
virtue
and
comely
and
good
parts
enough
and
hath
come
into
his
place
with
a
great
grace
though
with
a
great
skip
over
the
heads
of
a
great
many
as
chichly
and
denham
and
some
lords
that
did
expect
it
by
the
way
he
tells
me
that
of
all
the
great
men
of
england
there
is
none
that
endeavours
more
to
raise
those
that
he
takes
into
favour
than
my
lord
arlington
and
that
on
that
score
he
is
much
more
to
be
made
one
patron
than
my
lord
chancellor
who
never
did
nor
never
will
do
any
thing
but
for
money
certain
news
of
the
dutch
being
abroad
on
our
coast
with
great
ships
met
my
lady
newcastle
going
with
her
coaches
and
footmen
all
in
velvet
herself
whom
i
never
saw
before
as
i
have
heard
her
often
described
for
all
the
talk
is
of
her
extravagancies
with
her
her
hair
about
her
ears
many
black
patches
because
of
pimples
about
her
mouth
without
any
thing
about
it
and
a
black
she
seemed
to
me
a
very
comely
woman
but
i
hope
to
see
more
of
her
on
to
deptford
and
there
i
walked
down
the
yard
shish
and
cox
with
me
and
discoursed
about
cleaning
of
the
wet
docke
and
heard
which
i
had
before
how
when
the
docke
was
made
a
ship
of
near
tons
was
there
found
a
ship
supposed
of
queene
elizabeth
time
and
well
wrought
with
a
great
deal
of
stone
shot
in
her
of
eighteen
inches
diameter
which
was
shot
then
in
use
and
afterwards
meeting
with
captain
perriman
and
castle
at
tree
they
tell
me
of
of
inches
diameter
which
they
shot
out
of
i
hear
that
the
duke
of
cambridge
the
duke
of
york
son
james
second
son
to
the
duke
of
york
born
and
created
duke
of
cambridge
that
year
is
very
sick
and
my
lord
treasurer
very
bad
of
the
stone
and
hath
been
so
some
days
sir
carteret
tells
me
my
lord
arlington
hath
done
like
a
gentleman
by
him
in
all
things
he
says
if
my
lord
were
here
he
were
the
fittest
man
to
be
lord
treasurer
of
any
man
in
england
and
he
thinks
it
might
be
compassed
for
he
confesses
that
the
matters
do
suffer
through
the
inability
of
this
man
who
is
likely
to
die
and
he
will
propound
him
to
the
king
it
will
remove
him
from
his
place
at
sea
and
the
king
will
have
a
good
place
to
bestow
he
says
to
me
that
he
could
wish
when
my
lord
comes
that
he
would
think
fit
to
forbear
playing
as
a
thing
below
him
and
which
will
lessen
him
as
it
do
my
lord
albans
in
the
king
esteem
and
as
a
great
secret
tells
me
that
he
hath
made
a
match
for
my
lord
hinchingbroke
to
a
daughter
of
my
lord
burlington
richard
boyle
second
earl
of
cork
created
earl
of
burlington
where
there
is
great
alliance
portion
a
civil
family
and
relation
to
my
lord
chancellor
whose
son
hath
married
one
of
the
daughters
and
that
my
lord
chancellor
do
take
it
with
very
great
kindness
so
that
he
do
hold
himself
obliged
by
it
my
lord
sandwich
hath
referred
it
to
my
lord
crewe
sir
carteret
and
montagu
to
end
it
my
lord
hinchingbroke
and
the
ladies
know
nothing
yet
of
it
it
will
i
think
be
very
happy
i
met
with
pierce
and
he
tells
me
the
duke
of
cambridge
is
very
ill
and
full
of
spots
about
his
body
that
frazier
knows
not
what
to
think
of
it
may
to
westminster
in
the
way
meeting
many
with
their
garlands
upon
their
pails
dancing
with
a
fiddler
before
them
and
saw
pretty
nelly
nell
gwynne
standing
at
her
lodgings
door
in
in
her
smock
sleeves
and
bodice
looking
upon
one
she
seemed
a
mighty
pretty
creature
my
lord
crewe
walked
with
me
giving
me
an
account
of
the
meeting
of
the
commissioners
for
accounts
whereof
he
is
one
how
some
of
the
gentlemen
garraway
littleton
and
others
did
scruple
at
their
first
coming
there
being
called
thither
to
act
as
members
of
parliament
which
they
could
not
do
by
any
authority
but
that
of
the
parliament
and
therefore
desired
the
king
direction
in
it
which
was
sent
for
by
my
lord
bridgewater
who
brought
answer
very
short
that
the
king
expected
they
should
obey
his
commission
then
they
went
on
and
observed
upon
a
power
to
be
given
them
of
administering
and
framing
an
oath
which
they
thought
they
could
not
do
by
any
power
but
act
of
parliament
and
the
whole
commission
did
think
fit
to
have
the
judges
opinion
in
it
and
so
drawing
up
their
scruples
in
writing
they
all
attended
the
king
who
told
them
he
would
send
to
the
judges
to
be
answered
and
did
so
who
have
my
lord
tells
me
met
three
times
about
it
not
knowing
what
answer
to
give
it
and
they
have
met
this
week
doing
nothing
but
expecting
the
solution
of
the
judges
in
this
point
my
lord
tells
me
he
do
believe
this
commission
will
do
more
hurt
than
good
it
may
undo
some
accounts
if
these
men
shall
think
fit
but
it
can
never
clear
an
account
for
he
must
come
into
the
exchequer
for
all
this
besides
it
is
a
kind
of
inquisition
that
hath
seldom
ever
been
granted
in
england
and
he
believes
it
will
never
besides
give
any
satisfaction
to
the
people
or
parliament
but
be
looked
upon
as
a
forced
packed
business
of
the
king
especially
if
these
that
are
of
it
shall
not
concur
with
them
which
he
doubts
they
will
not
and
therefore
wishes
much
that
the
king
would
lay
hold
of
this
fit
occasion
and
let
the
commission
fall
then
to
talk
of
my
lord
sandwich
whom
my
lord
crewe
hath
a
great
desire
might
get
to
be
lord
treasurer
if
the
present
lord
should
die
as
it
is
believed
he
will
in
a
little
time
and
thinks
he
can
have
no
competitor
but
my
lord
arlington
who
it
is
given
out
desires
it
but
my
lord
thinks
not
for
that
the
being
secretary
do
keep
him
a
greater
interest
with
the
king
than
the
other
would
do
at
least
do
believe
that
if
my
lord
would
surrender
him
his
wardrobe
place
it
would
be
a
temptation
to
arlington
to
assist
my
lord
in
getting
the
treasurer
i
did
object
to
my
lord
that
it
would
be
no
place
of
content
nor
safety
nor
honour
for
my
lord
the
state
being
so
indigent
as
it
is
and
the
king
so
irregular
and
those
about
him
that
my
lord
must
be
forced
to
part
with
any
thing
to
answer
his
warrants
and
that
therefore
i
do
believe
the
king
had
rather
have
a
man
that
may
be
one
of
his
vicious
caball
than
a
sober
man
that
will
mind
the
publick
that
so
they
may
sit
at
cards
and
dispose
of
the
revenue
of
the
kingdom
this
my
lord
was
moved
at
and
said
he
did
not
indeed
know
how
to
answer
it
and
bid
me
think
of
it
and
so
said
he
himself
would
also
do
he
do
mightily
cry
out
of
the
bad
management
of
our
monies
the
king
having
had
so
much
given
him
and
yet
when
the
parliament
do
find
that
the
king
should
have
in
his
purse
by
the
best
account
of
issues
they
have
yet
seen
yet
we
should
report
in
the
navy
a
debt
due
from
the
king
of
which
i
did
confess
i
doubted
was
true
in
the
first
and
knew
to
be
true
in
the
last
and
did
believe
that
there
was
some
great
miscarriages
in
it
which
he
owned
to
believe
also
saying
that
at
this
rate
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
the
kingdom
to
make
a
war
nor
answer
the
king
wants
thence
away
to
the
playhouse
and
saw
love
in
a
maze
downes
mentions
this
play
which
was
never
printed
nor
is
the
author
known
but
a
sorry
play
only
lacy
clowne
part
which
he
did
most
admirably
indeed
and
i
am
glad
to
find
the
rogue
at
liberty
again
here
was
but
little
and
that
ordinary
company
we
sat
at
the
upper
bench
next
the
boxes
and
i
find
it
do
pretty
well
and
have
the
advantage
of
seeing
and
hearing
the
great
people
which
may
be
pleasant
when
there
is
good
store
now
was
only
prince
rupert
and
my
lord
lauderdale
and
my
lord
probaby
craven
the
naming
of
whom
puts
me
in
mind
of
my
seeing
at
sir
robert
two
or
three
great
silver
flagons
made
with
inscriptions
as
gifts
of
the
king
to
such
and
such
persons
of
quality
as
did
stay
in
town
the
late
great
plague
for
the
keeping
things
in
order
in
the
town
thence
sir
pen
and
i
in
his
coach
tiburne
way
into
the
park
where
a
horrid
dust
and
number
of
coaches
without
pleasure
or
order
that
which
we
and
almost
all
went
for
was
to
see
my
lady
newcastle
which
we
could
not
she
being
followed
and
crowded
upon
by
coaches
all
the
way
she
went
that
nobody
could
come
near
her
only
i
could
see
she
was
in
a
large
black
coach
adorned
with
silver
instead
of
gold
and
so
white
curtains
and
every
thing
black
and
white
and
herself
in
her
cap
sir
pen
did
give
me
an
account
this
afternoon
of
his
design
of
buying
sir
robert
brookes
fine
house
at
wansted
which
i
so
wondered
at
and
did
give
him
reasons
against
it
which
he
allowed
of
and
told
me
that
he
did
intend
to
pull
down
the
house
and
build
a
less
and
that
he
should
get
by
the
old
house
and
i
know
not
what
fooleries
but
i
will
never
believe
he
ever
intended
to
buy
it
for
my
part
though
he
troubled
gauden
to
go
and
look
upon
it
and
advise
him
in
it
to
the
duke
of
york
chamber
which
as
it
is
now
fretted
at
the
top
and
the
made
handsome
is
one
of
the
noblest
and
rooms
that
ever
i
think
i
saw
to
westminster
by
coach
the
cofferer
mr
ashburnham
telling
us
odd
stories
how
he
was
dealt
with
by
the
men
of
the
church
at
westminster
in
taking
a
lease
of
them
at
the
king
coming
in
and
particularly
the
devilish
covetousness
of
busby
richard
busby
master
of
westminster
school
and
in
made
a
prebendary
of
westminster
notwithstanding
the
character
given
of
him
here
he
was
a
liberal
benefactor
to
christ
church
oxford
and
lichfield
cathedral
ob
aged
took
a
turn
with
my
old
acquaintance
pechell
whose
red
nose
makes
me
ashamed
to
be
seen
with
him
though
otherwise
a
man
this
day
the
news
is
come
that
the
fleet
of
the
dutch
of
about
ships
which
come
upon
our
coasts
upon
design
to
have
intercepted
our
colliers
but
by
good
luck
failed
is
gone
to
the
frith
and
there
lies
perhaps
to
trouble
the
scotch
privateers
which
have
galled
them
of
late
very
much
it
may
be
more
than
all
our
last
year
fleet
sir
john
robinson
tells
me
he
hath
now
got
a
street
ordered
to
be
continued
forty
feet
broad
from
paul
through
street
to
the
tower
which
will
be
very
fine
he
and
others
this
day
where
i
was
in
the
afternoon
do
tell
me
of
at
least
six
or
eight
fires
within
these
few
days
and
continually
stirs
of
fire
and
real
fires
there
have
been
in
one
place
or
other
almost
ever
since
the
late
great
fire
as
if
there
was
a
fate
sent
people
for
fire
i
walked
over
the
park
to
sir
coventry
we
talked
of
tangier
of
which
he
is
ashamed
also
that
it
should
put
the
king
to
this
charge
for
no
good
in
the
world
and
now
a
man
going
over
that
is
a
good
soldier
but
a
debauched
man
which
the
place
need
not
to
have
and
so
used
these
words
that
this
place
was
to
the
king
as
my
lord
carnarvon
charles
dormer
succeeded
his
father
who
fell
at
the
battle
of
newbury
as
earl
of
carnarvon
ob
says
of
wood
that
it
is
an
excrescence
of
the
earth
provided
by
god
for
the
payment
of
debts
this
day
sir
coventry
tells
me
the
dutch
fleet
shot
some
shot
four
or
five
hundred
into
burnt
island
in
the
frith
but
without
any
hurt
and
so
are
gone
to
james
but
there
find
sir
coventry
gone
out
betimes
this
morning
on
horseback
with
the
king
and
duke
of
york
to
to
run
some
horses
in
our
street
at
the
three
tuns
tavern
i
find
a
great
hubbub
and
what
was
it
but
two
brothers
had
fallen
out
and
one
killed
the
other
and
who
should
they
be
but
the
two
fieldings
one
whereof
bazill
was
page
to
my
lady
sandwich
and
he
hath
killed
the
other
himself
being
very
drunk
and
so
is
sent
to
newgate
at
noon
to
kent
at
the
three
tuns
tavern
and
there
the
constable
of
the
parish
did
show
us
the
picklocks
and
dice
that
were
found
in
the
dead
man
pocket
and
but
in
money
and
a
wherein
were
entered
the
names
of
several
places
where
he
was
to
go
and
among
others
his
house
where
he
was
to
dine
and
did
dine
yesterday
and
after
dinner
went
into
the
church
and
there
saw
his
corpse
with
the
wound
in
his
left
breast
a
sad
spectacle
and
a
broad
wound
which
makes
my
hand
now
shake
to
write
of
it
his
brother
intending
it
seems
to
kill
the
coachman
who
did
not
please
him
this
fellow
stepped
in
and
took
away
his
sword
who
thereupon
took
out
his
knife
which
was
of
the
fashion
with
a
falchion
blade
and
a
little
cross
at
the
hilt
like
a
dagger
and
with
that
stabbed
him
drove
hard
towards
clerkenwell
thinking
to
have
overtaken
my
lady
newcastle
whom
i
saw
before
us
in
her
coach
with
boys
and
girls
running
looking
upon
her
but
i
could
not
and
so
she
got
home
before
i
could
come
up
to
her
but
i
will
get
a
time
to
see
her
walked
over
the
fields
to
kingsland
and
back
again
a
walk
i
think
i
have
not
taken
these
twenty
years
but
puts
me
in
mind
of
my
boy
time
when
i
boarded
at
kingsland
and
used
to
shoot
with
my
bow
and
arrows
in
these
fields
this
morning
come
sir
cholmly
to
me
for
a
tally
or
two
and
tells
me
that
he
hears
that
we
are
by
agreement
to
give
the
king
of
france
nova
scotia
which
he
do
not
like
but
i
do
not
know
the
importance
of
it
sir
philip
warwick
do
please
himself
like
a
good
man
to
tell
some
of
the
good
ejaculations
of
my
lord
treasurer
concerning
the
little
worth
of
this
world
to
buy
it
with
so
much
pain
and
other
things
fit
for
a
dying
man
to
my
lord
chancellor
where
i
met
povy
expecting
the
coming
of
the
rest
of
the
commissioners
for
tangier
here
i
understand
how
the
two
dukes
both
the
only
sons
of
the
duke
of
york
are
sick
even
to
danger
and
that
on
sunday
last
they
were
both
so
ill
as
that
the
poor
duchesse
was
in
doubt
which
would
die
the
duke
of
cambridge
of
some
general
disease
the
other
little
duke
whose
title
i
know
not
of
the
convulsion
fits
of
which
he
had
four
this
morning
fear
that
either
of
them
might
be
dead
did
make
us
think
that
it
was
the
occasion
that
the
duke
of
york
and
others
were
not
come
to
the
meeting
of
the
commission
which
was
designed
and
my
lord
chancellor
did
expect
and
it
was
pretty
to
observe
how
when
my
lord
sent
down
to
james
to
see
why
the
duke
of
york
come
not
and
povy
who
went
returned
my
lord
did
ask
not
how
the
princes
or
the
dukes
do
as
other
people
do
but
how
do
the
children
which
methought
was
mighty
great
and
like
a
great
man
and
grandfather
i
find
every
body
mightily
concerned
for
these
children
as
a
matter
wherein
the
state
is
much
concerned
that
they
should
live
i
away
with
sir
carteret
to
london
talking
all
the
way
and
he
do
tell
me
that
the
business
of
my
lord
hinchingbroke
his
marriage
with
my
lord
burlington
daughter
is
concluded
on
by
all
friends
and
that
my
lady
is
now
told
of
it
and
do
mightily
please
herself
with
it
which
i
am
mightily
glad
of
news
still
that
my
lord
treasurer
is
so
ill
as
not
to
be
any
man
of
this
world
and
it
is
said
that
the
treasury
shall
be
managed
by
commission
i
would
to
god
sir
carteret
or
my
lord
sandwich
be
in
it
but
the
latter
is
the
more
fit
for
it
this
being
holy
thursday
when
the
boys
go
our
procession
round
the
parish
we
were
to
go
to
the
three
tuns
tavern
to
dine
with
the
rest
of
the
parish
where
all
the
parish
almost
was
sir
andrew
rickard
and
others
and
of
our
house
minnes
batten
pen
and
myself
and
mills
did
sit
uppermost
at
the
table
sir
john
fredricke
lord
mayor
of
london
and
president
of
christ
hospital
his
eldest
son
john
was
created
a
baronet
and
sir
ford
did
talk
of
school
which
they
tell
me
must
be
taken
away
and
then
i
fear
it
will
be
long
before
another
place
such
as
they
say
is
promised
is
found
but
they
do
say
that
the
honour
of
their
company
the
mercers
company
under
whose
superintendence
paul
school
was
placed
by
the
founder
is
concerned
in
the
doing
of
it
and
that
it
is
a
thing
that
they
are
obliged
to
do
to
my
lord
treasurer
where
i
find
the
porter
crying
and
suspected
it
was
that
my
lord
is
dead
and
poor
lord
we
did
find
that
he
was
dead
just
now
there
is
a
good
man
gone
and
i
pray
god
that
the
treasury
may
not
be
worse
managed
the
hand
or
hands
it
shall
now
be
put
into
though
for
certain
the
slowness
though
he
was
of
great
integrity
of
this
man
and
remissness
have
gone
as
far
to
undo
the
nation
as
any
thing
else
that
hath
happened
and
yet
if
i
knew
all
the
difficulties
that
he
hath
lain
under
and
his
instrument
sir
philip
warwick
i
might
be
true
to
another
mind
it
is
remarkable
that
this
afternoon
moore
come
to
me
and
there
among
other
things
did
tell
me
how
moyer
the
merchant
having
procured
an
order
from
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
council
with
the
consent
of
my
lord
chancellor
and
by
assistance
of
lord
arlington
for
the
releasing
out
of
prison
his
brother
samuel
moyer
who
was
a
great
man
in
the
late
times
in
and
was
engaged
under
hand
and
seal
to
give
the
man
that
obtained
it
so
much
in
behalf
of
my
lord
chancellor
but
it
seems
my
lady
duchesse
of
albemarle
had
before
undertaken
it
for
so
much
money
but
hath
not
done
it
the
duke
of
albemarle
did
the
next
day
send
for
this
moyer
to
tell
him
that
notwithstanding
this
order
of
the
king
and
council
being
passed
for
release
of
his
brother
yet
if
he
did
not
consider
the
pains
of
some
friends
of
his
he
would
stop
that
order
this
moyer
being
an
honest
bold
man
told
him
that
he
was
engaged
to
the
hand
that
had
done
the
thing
to
give
him
a
reward
and
more
he
could
not
give
nor
could
own
any
kindness
done
by
his
grace
interest
and
so
parted
the
next
day
sir
edward
savage
did
take
the
said
moyer
in
tax
about
it
giving
ill
words
of
this
moyer
and
his
brother
which
he
not
being
able
to
bear
told
him
he
would
give
to
the
person
that
had
engaged
him
what
he
promised
and
not
any
thing
to
any
body
else
and
that
both
he
and
his
brother
were
as
honest
men
as
himself
or
any
man
else
and
so
sent
him
going
and
bid
him
do
his
worst
it
is
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
cases
that
ever
i
saw
or
understood
but
it
is
true
to
sir
viner
with
pieces
of
gold
to
turn
into
silver
for
the
enabling
me
to
answer
sir
carteret
which
he
now
draws
all
out
of
my
hand
towards
the
paying
for
a
purchase
he
hath
made
for
his
son
and
my
lady
jemimah
in
northamptonshire
of
sir
samuel
luke
sir
samuel
luke
was
according
to
granger
the
original
hudibras
of
butler
in
a
good
place
a
good
house
and
near
all
her
friends
which
is
a
very
happy
thing
great
talk
of
the
good
end
that
my
lord
treasurer
made
closing
his
own
eyes
and
wetting
his
mouth
and
bidding
adieu
with
the
greatest
content
and
freedom
in
the
world
and
is
said
to
die
with
the
cleanest
hands
that
ever
any
lord
treasurer
did
how
come
to
see
us
and
among
other
things
told
us
how
the
barristers
and
students
of
gray
inne
rose
in
rebellion
against
the
benchers
the
other
day
who
outlawed
them
and
a
great
deal
of
do
but
now
they
are
at
peace
again
among
other
news
i
hear
that
the
commissioners
for
the
treasury
were
named
by
the
king
yesterday
but
who
they
are
nobody
could
tell
but
the
persons
are
the
lord
chancellor
the
two
secretaries
lord
ashly
and
others
say
sir
coventry
and
sir
john
duncomb
but
all
conclude
the
duke
of
albemarle
but
reports
do
differ
up
and
by
water
to
white
hall
to
sir
carteret
who
tells
me
now
for
certain
how
the
commission
for
the
treasury
is
disposed
of
viz
to
duke
of
albemarle
lord
ashly
sir
coventry
sir
john
duncomb
and
sir
thomas
clifford
at
which
he
says
all
the
whole
court
is
disturbed
it
having
been
once
concluded
otherwise
into
the
other
hands
formerly
mentioned
in
yesterday
notes
but
all
of
a
sudden
the
king
choice
was
changed
and
these
are
to
be
the
men
the
first
of
which
is
only
for
a
puppet
to
give
honour
to
the
rest
he
do
presage
that
these
men
will
make
it
their
business
to
find
faults
in
the
management
of
the
late
lord
treasurer
and
in
discouraging
the
bankers
but
i
am
whatever
i
in
compliance
do
say
to
him
of
another
mind
and
my
heart
is
very
glad
of
it
for
i
do
expect
they
will
do
much
good
and
that
it
is
the
happiest
thing
that
hath
appeared
to
me
for
the
good
of
the
nation
since
the
king
come
in
thence
to
james
and
up
to
the
duke
of
york
and
there
in
his
chamber
sir
coventry
did
of
himself
take
notice
of
this
business
of
the
treasury
wherein
he
is
in
the
commission
and
desired
that
i
would
be
thinking
of
any
thing
fit
for
him
to
be
acquainted
with
for
the
lessening
of
charge
and
bettering
of
our
credit
and
what
our
expence
hath
been
since
the
king
coming
home
which
he
believes
will
be
one
of
the
first
things
they
shall
enquire
into
which
i
promised
him
and
from
time
to
time
which
he
desires
give
him
an
account
of
what
i
can
think
of
worthy
his
knowledge
i
am
mighty
glad
of
this
opportunity
of
professing
my
joy
to
him
in
what
choice
the
king
hath
made
and
the
hopes
i
have
that
it
will
save
the
kingdom
from
perishing
and
how
it
do
encourage
me
to
take
pains
again
after
my
having
through
despair
neglected
it
which
he
told
me
of
himself
that
it
was
so
with
him
that
he
had
given
himself
up
to
more
ease
than
ever
he
expected
and
that
his
opinion
of
matters
was
so
bad
that
there
was
no
public
employment
in
the
kingdom
should
have
been
accepted
by
him
but
this
which
the
king
hath
now
given
him
and
therein
he
is
glad
in
hopes
of
the
service
he
may
do
therein
and
in
my
conscience
he
will
so
into
the
duke
of
york
closet
and
there
among
other
things
sir
coventry
did
take
notice
of
what
he
told
me
the
other
day
about
a
report
of
commissioner
pett
dealing
for
timber
in
the
navy
and
selling
it
to
us
in
other
names
and
besides
his
own
proof
did
produce
a
paper
i
had
given
him
this
morning
about
it
in
the
case
of
widow
murford
and
morecocke
which
was
so
handled
that
the
duke
of
york
grew
very
angry
and
commanded
us
presently
to
fall
into
the
examination
of
it
saying
that
he
would
not
trust
a
man
for
his
sake
that
lifts
up
the
whites
of
his
eyes
and
it
was
declared
that
if
he
be
found
to
have
done
so
he
should
be
reckoned
unfit
to
serve
the
navy
and
i
do
believe
he
will
be
turned
out
and
it
was
methought
a
worthy
saying
of
sir
coventry
to
the
duke
of
york
sir
says
he
i
do
not
make
this
complaint
out
of
any
disrespect
to
commissioner
pett
but
because
i
do
love
to
do
these
things
fairly
and
openly
this
day
coming
from
westminster
with
batten
we
saw
at
white
hall
stairs
a
with
a
sturgeon
that
he
had
newly
catched
in
the
river
which
i
saw
but
it
was
but
a
little
one
but
big
enough
to
prevent
my
mistake
of
that
for
a
colt
if
ever
i
become
mayor
of
huntingdon
sir
john
duncomb
is
sworn
yesterday
a
this
day
i
hear
also
that
last
night
the
duke
of
kendall
henry
stuart
created
duke
of
kendall
second
son
of
the
duke
of
york
did
die
and
that
the
other
duke
of
cambridge
continues
very
ill
still
all
our
discourse
about
brampton
and
my
intentions
to
build
there
if
i
could
be
free
of
my
engagement
to
my
uncle
thomas
and
his
son
that
they
may
not
have
what
i
have
built
against
my
will
in
case
of
me
and
my
brother
being
without
heirs
male
which
is
the
true
reason
why
i
am
against
laying
out
money
upon
that
place
together
with
my
fear
of
some
inconvenience
by
being
so
near
hinchingbroke
being
obliged
to
be
a
servant
to
that
family
and
subject
to
what
expence
they
shall
call
me
and
to
have
all
that
i
shall
buy
or
do
esteemed
as
got
by
the
death
of
my
uncle
when
indeed
what
i
have
from
him
is
not
worth
naming
the
new
commissioners
of
the
treasury
have
chosen
sir
downing
for
their
secretary
and
i
think
in
my
conscience
they
have
done
a
great
thing
in
it
for
he
is
active
and
a
man
of
business
and
values
himself
upon
having
of
things
do
well
under
his
hand
so
that
i
am
mightily
pleased
in
their
choice
abroad
and
stopped
at
stairs
there
to
see
a
prize
fought
but
the
house
so
full
there
was
no
getting
in
there
so
forced
to
go
through
an
alehouse
into
the
pit
where
the
bears
are
baited
and
upon
a
stool
did
see
them
fight
which
they
did
very
furiously
a
butcher
and
a
waterman
the
former
had
the
better
all
along
till
by
and
by
the
latter
dropped
his
sword
out
of
his
hand
and
the
butcher
whether
not
seeing
his
sword
dropped
i
know
not
but
did
give
him
a
cut
over
the
wrist
so
as
he
was
disabled
to
fight
any
longer
but
lord
to
see
how
in
a
minute
the
whole
stage
was
full
of
watermen
to
revenge
the
foul
play
and
the
butchers
to
defend
their
fellow
though
most
blamed
him
and
there
they
all
fell
to
it
to
knocking
down
and
cutting
many
on
each
side
it
was
pleasant
to
see
but
that
i
stood
in
the
pit
and
feared
that
in
the
tumult
i
might
get
some
hurt
at
last
the
battle
broke
up
and
so
i
away
the
duke
of
cambridge
very
ill
still
up
and
by
coach
to
james
where
i
find
sir
coventry
desirous
to
have
spoke
with
me
it
was
to
read
over
a
draught
of
a
letter
which
he
hath
made
for
his
brother
commissioners
and
him
to
sign
to
us
demanding
an
account
of
the
whole
business
of
the
navy
accounts
and
i
perceive
by
the
way
he
goes
about
it
that
they
will
do
admirable
things
he
tells
me
that
they
have
chosen
sir
downing
their
secretary
who
will
be
as
fit
a
man
as
any
in
the
world
and
he
said
by
the
by
speaking
of
the
banquers
being
fearful
of
sir
downing
being
secretary
he
being
their
enemy
that
they
did
not
intend
to
be
ruled
by
their
secretary
but
do
the
business
themselves
my
heart
is
glad
to
see
so
great
hopes
of
good
to
the
nation
as
will
be
by
these
men
and
it
do
me
good
to
see
sir
coventry
so
cheerfull
as
he
now
is
on
the
same
score
my
wife
away
down
with
jane
and
hewer
to
woolwich
in
order
to
a
little
ayre
and
to
lie
there
to
night
and
so
to
gather
morning
which
turner
hath
taught
her
is
the
only
thing
in
the
world
to
wash
her
face
with
and
i
am
contented
with
it
i
by
water
to
and
there
walked
in
a
great
deal
of
company
and
the
weather
and
garden
pleasant
and
it
is
very
pleasant
and
cheap
going
thither
for
a
man
may
go
to
spend
what
he
will
or
nothing
all
as
one
but
to
hear
the
nightingale
and
other
birds
and
hear
fiddles
and
there
a
harp
and
here
a
trump
and
here
laughing
and
there
fine
people
walking
is
mighty
divertising
our
parson
mills
having
the
offer
of
another
benefice
the
rectory
of
wansted
in
essex
to
which
he
was
presented
by
sir
robert
brookes
who
was
his
tutor
he
by
my
lord
barkeley
is
made
one
of
the
duke
chaplains
which
qualifies
him
for
two
livings
but
to
see
how
slightly
such
things
are
done
the
duke
of
york
only
taking
my
lord
barkeley
word
upon
saying
that
we
the
officers
of
the
navy
do
say
that
he
is
a
good
man
and
minister
of
our
parish
and
the
duke
of
york
admits
him
to
kiss
his
hand
but
speaks
not
one
word
to
him
but
so
a
warrant
will
be
drawn
from
the
duke
of
york
to
qualify
him
and
there
an
end
of
it
after
dinner
i
walked
to
arundell
house
the
way
very
dusty
the
day
of
meeting
of
the
society
being
changed
from
wednesday
to
thursday
which
i
knew
not
before
because
the
wednesday
is
a
and
several
of
the
council
are
of
the
society
and
would
come
but
for
their
attending
the
king
at
council
where
i
find
very
much
company
in
expectation
of
the
duchesse
of
newcastle
who
had
desired
to
be
invited
to
the
society
and
was
after
much
debate
pro
and
con
it
seems
many
being
against
it
and
we
do
believe
the
town
will
be
full
of
ballads
of
it
anon
comes
the
duchesse
with
her
women
attending
her
among
others
the
ferabosco
of
whom
so
much
talk
is
that
her
lady
would
bid
her
show
her
face
and
kill
the
gallants
she
is
indeed
black
and
hath
good
black
little
eyes
but
otherwise
a
very
ordinary
woman
i
do
think
but
they
say
sings
well
the
duchesse
hath
been
a
good
comely
woman
but
her
dress
so
antick
and
her
deportment
so
ordinary
that
i
do
not
like
her
at
all
nor
did
i
hear
her
say
any
thing
that
was
worth
hearing
but
that
she
was
full
of
admiration
all
admiration
several
fine
experiments
were
shown
her
of
colours
loadstones
microscopes
and
of
liquors
among
others
of
one
that
did
while
she
was
there
turn
a
piece
of
roasted
mutton
into
pure
blood
which
was
very
rare
here
was
moore
of
cambridge
whom
i
had
not
seen
before
and
i
was
glad
to
see
her
as
also
a
very
black
boy
that
ran
up
and
down
the
room
somebody
child
in
arundell
house
after
they
had
shown
her
many
experiments
and
she
cried
still
she
was
full
of
admiration
she
departed
being
led
out
and
in
by
several
lords
that
were
there
among
others
lord
george
barkeley
and
earl
of
carlisle
charles
howard
created
earl
of
carlisle
employed
on
several
embassies
and
governor
of
jamaica
ob
and
a
very
pretty
young
man
the
duke
of
somerset
francis
fifth
duke
of
somerset
murdered
in
italy
at
the
treasury
chamber
here
i
saw
duncomb
look
as
big
and
take
as
much
state
on
him
as
if
he
had
been
born
a
lord
here
i
met
with
sir
cholmly
who
tells
me
that
he
is
told
this
day
by
secretary
morris
that
he
believes
we
are
and
shall
be
only
fooled
by
the
french
and
that
the
dutch
are
very
high
and
insolent
and
do
look
upon
us
as
come
over
only
to
beg
a
peace
which
troubles
me
very
much
and
i
do
fear
it
is
true
thence
to
sir
carteret
at
his
lodgings
who
i
perceive
is
mightily
displeased
with
this
new
treasury
and
he
hath
reason
for
it
will
eclipse
him
and
he
tells
me
that
my
lord
ashly
says
they
understand
nothing
and
he
says
he
believes
the
king
do
not
intend
they
shall
sit
long
but
i
believe
no
such
thing
but
that
the
king
will
find
such
benefit
by
them
as
he
will
desire
to
have
them
continue
as
we
see
he
hath
done
in
the
late
new
act
that
was
so
much
decried
about
the
king
but
yet
the
king
hath
since
permitted
it
and
found
good
by
it
he
says
and
i
believe
that
a
great
many
persons
at
court
are
angry
at
the
rise
of
this
duncomb
whose
father
he
tells
me
was
a
man
and
a
great
committee
man
and
this
fellow
used
to
carry
his
papers
to
committees
after
him
he
was
a
kind
of
an
atturny
but
for
all
this
i
believe
will
be
a
great
man
in
spite
of
all
in
the
evening
home
and
there
to
my
unexpected
satisfaction
did
get
my
intricate
accounts
of
interest
which
have
been
of
late
much
perplexed
by
mixing
of
some
moneys
of
sir
carteret
with
mine
evened
and
set
right
and
so
late
to
supper
and
with
great
quiet
to
bed
finding
by
the
balance
of
my
account
that
i
am
creditor
for
which
the
lord
of
heaven
be
praised
june
up
and
there
comes
to
me
mr
commander
whom
i
employ
about
hiring
of
some
ground
behind
the
office
for
the
building
of
me
a
stable
and
for
i
do
find
it
necessary
for
me
both
in
respect
of
honour
and
the
profit
of
it
also
my
expense
in
being
now
so
great
to
keep
a
coach
and
therefore
will
do
it
having
given
him
some
instructions
about
it
i
to
the
office
where
we
have
news
that
our
peace
with
spain
as
to
trade
is
wholly
concluded
and
we
are
to
furnish
him
with
some
men
for
flanders
against
the
french
how
that
will
agree
with
the
french
i
know
not
but
they
say
that
he
also
hath
liberty
to
get
what
men
he
pleases
out
of
england
but
for
the
spaniard
i
hear
that
my
lord
castlehaven
is
raising
a
regiment
of
men
which
he
is
to
command
there
and
several
young
gentlemen
are
going
over
in
commands
with
him
and
they
say
the
duke
of
monmouth
is
going
over
only
as
a
traveller
not
to
engage
on
either
side
but
only
to
see
the
campagne
which
will
be
becoming
him
much
more
than
to
live
as
he
now
do
met
mills
our
parson
whom
i
went
back
with
to
bring
him
to
sir
coventry
to
give
him
the
form
of
a
qualification
for
the
duke
of
york
to
sign
to
to
enable
him
to
have
two
livings
which
was
a
service
i
did
but
much
against
my
will
for
a
lazy
fat
priest
sir
william
doyly
did
lay
a
wager
with
me
the
treasurership
would
be
in
one
hand
notwithstanding
this
present
commission
before
christmas
on
which
we
did
lay
a
poll
of
ling
a
brace
of
carps
and
a
bottle
of
wine
and
sir
pen
and
scowen
to
be
at
the
eating
of
them
thence
down
by
water
to
deptford
it
being
trinity
monday
when
the
master
is
chosen
and
so
i
down
with
them
and
we
had
a
good
dinner
of
plain
meat
and
good
company
at
our
table
among
others
my
good
evelyn
with
whom
after
dinner
i
stepped
aside
and
talked
upon
the
present
posture
of
our
affairs
which
is
that
the
dutch
are
known
to
be
abroad
with
eighty
sail
of
ships
of
war
and
twenty
and
the
french
come
into
the
channell
with
twenty
sail
of
and
five
while
we
have
not
a
ship
at
sea
to
do
them
any
hurt
with
but
are
calling
in
all
we
can
while
our
embassadors
are
treating
at
bredah
and
the
dutch
look
upon
them
as
come
to
beg
peace
and
use
them
accordingly
and
all
this
through
the
negligence
of
our
prince
who
had
power
if
he
would
to
master
all
these
with
the
money
and
men
that
he
hath
had
the
command
of
and
may
now
have
if
he
would
mind
his
business
in
the
an
hour
or
two
where
we
saw
the
country
receivers
and
accountants
come
to
attend
and
one
of
them
a
brisk
young
fellow
with
his
hat
cocked
like
a
fool
behind
as
the
present
fashion
among
the
blades
is
committed
to
the
serjeant
by
and
by
i
upon
desire
was
called
in
and
delivered
in
my
report
of
my
accounts
present
lord
ashly
clifford
and
duncomb
but
i
do
like
the
way
of
these
lords
that
they
admit
nobody
to
use
many
words
nor
do
they
spend
many
words
themselves
but
in
great
state
do
bear
what
they
see
necessary
and
say
little
themselves
but
bid
withdraw
captain
perriman
brings
us
word
bow
the
happy
crew
below
in
the
hope
ordered
to
carry
the
portugal
embassador
to
holland
and
the
embassador
i
think
on
board
refuse
to
go
till
paid
and
by
their
example
two
or
three
more
ships
are
in
a
mutiny
which
is
a
sad
consideration
while
so
many
of
the
enemy
ships
are
at
this
day
triumphing
in
the
sea
sir
carteret
showed
me
a
gentleman
coming
by
in
his
coach
who
hath
been
sent
for
up
out
of
lincolnshire
i
think
he
says
he
is
a
justice
of
peace
there
that
the
council
have
laid
by
the
heels
here
and
here
lies
in
a
messenger
hands
for
saying
that
a
man
and
his
wife
are
but
one
person
and
so
ought
to
pay
but
for
both
to
the
poll
bill
by
which
others
were
led
to
do
the
like
and
so
here
he
lies
prisoner
with
townsend
whom
i
sent
for
to
come
to
me
to
discourse
about
my
lord
sandwich
business
for
whom
i
am
in
some
pain
lest
the
accounts
of
the
wardrobe
may
not
be
in
so
good
order
as
may
please
the
new
lords
treasurers
who
are
sighted
and
under
obligations
of
recommending
themselves
to
the
king
and
the
world
by
their
finding
and
mending
of
faults
and
are
most
of
them
not
the
best
friends
to
my
lord
up
and
to
the
office
where
all
the
news
this
morning
is
that
the
dutch
are
come
with
a
fleet
of
eighty
sail
to
harwich
and
that
guns
were
heard
plain
by
sir
rider
people
at
all
yesterday
even
the
news
is
confirmed
that
the
dutch
are
off
harwich
but
had
done
nothing
last
night
the
king
hath
sent
down
my
lord
of
oxford
to
raise
the
countries
there
and
all
the
western
barges
are
taken
up
to
make
a
bridge
over
the
river
about
the
hope
for
horse
to
cross
the
river
if
there
be
occasion
i
hear
that
the
duke
of
cambridge
who
was
given
over
long
since
by
the
doctors
is
now
likely
to
recover
for
which
god
be
praised
to
sir
coventry
and
there
talked
with
him
a
great
while
and
mighty
glad
i
was
of
my
good
fortune
to
visit
him
for
it
keeps
in
my
acquaintance
with
him
and
the
world
sees
it
and
reckons
my
interest
accordingly
in
comes
my
lord
barkeley
who
is
going
down
to
harwich
also
to
look
after
the
militia
there
and
there
is
also
the
duke
of
monmouth
and
with
him
a
great
many
young
hectors
the
lord
chesterfield
my
lord
mandeville
and
others
but
to
little
purpose
i
fear
but
to
debauch
the
country
women
thereabouts
my
lord
barkeley
wanting
some
maps
and
sir
coventry
recommending
the
six
maps
of
england
that
are
bound
up
for
the
pocket
i
did
offer
to
present
my
lord
with
them
which
he
accepted
and
so
i
will
send
them
him
i
find
an
order
come
for
the
getting
some
presently
to
annoy
the
dutch
who
are
in
the
king
channel
and
expected
up
higher
up
and
news
brought
us
that
the
dutch
are
come
up
as
high
as
the
nore
and
more
presing
orders
for
batten
pen
and
i
to
james
whence
the
duke
of
york
gone
this
morning
betimes
to
send
away
some
men
down
to
chatham
so
we
then
to
white
hall
and
meet
sir
coventry
who
presses
all
that
is
possible
for
fireships
so
we
three
to
the
office
presently
and
thither
comes
sir
fretcheville
hollis
who
is
to
command
them
all
in
some
exploits
he
is
to
do
with
them
on
the
enemy
in
the
river
son
of
fretcheville
hollis
of
grimsby
colonel
of
a
regiment
on
the
king
side
during
the
civil
wars
in
which
he
acquired
considerable
credit
by
his
second
wife
elizabeth
molesworth
and
himself
a
distinguished
naval
officer
he
lost
an
arm
in
the
and
afterwards
served
as
under
sir
holmes
when
they
attacked
the
smyrna
fleet
he
fell
in
the
battle
of
southwold
bay
on
board
the
cambridge
although
pepys
speaks
slightingly
of
sir
he
was
a
man
of
high
spirit
and
enterprise
and
is
thus
eulogised
by
dryden
in
his
annus
mirabilis
young
hollis
on
a
muse
by
mars
begot
born
to
write
and
act
great
deeds
impatient
to
revenge
his
fatal
shot
his
right
hand
doubly
to
his
left
succeeds
so
we
all
down
to
deptford
and
pitched
upon
ships
and
set
men
at
work
but
lord
to
see
how
backwardly
things
move
at
this
pinch
notwithstanding
that
by
the
enemy
being
now
come
up
as
high
as
almost
the
hope
sir
minnes
who
was
gone
down
to
pay
some
ships
there
hath
sent
up
the
money
and
so
we
are
possessed
of
money
to
do
what
we
will
with
yet
partly
ourselves
being
used
to
be
idle
and
in
despair
and
partly
people
that
have
been
used
to
be
deceived
by
us
as
to
money
wo
believe
us
and
we
know
not
though
we
have
it
how
almost
to
promise
it
and
our
wants
such
and
men
out
of
the
way
that
it
is
an
admirable
thing
to
consider
how
much
the
king
suffers
and
how
necessary
it
is
in
a
state
to
keep
the
king
service
always
in
a
good
posture
and
credit
down
to
gravesend
where
i
find
the
duke
of
albemarle
just
come
with
a
great
many
idle
lords
and
gentlemen
with
their
pistols
and
fooleries
and
the
bulworke
not
able
to
have
stood
half
an
hour
had
they
come
up
but
the
dutch
are
fallen
down
from
the
hope
and
as
low
as
sheerenesse
and
we
do
plainly
at
this
time
hear
the
guns
play
yet
i
do
not
find
the
duke
of
albemarle
intends
to
go
thither
but
stays
here
and
hath
though
the
dutch
are
gone
ordered
our
frigates
to
be
brought
to
a
line
between
the
two
which
i
took
then
to
be
a
ridiculous
thing
i
find
the
town
had
removed
most
of
their
goods
out
of
the
town
for
fear
of
the
dutch
coming
up
to
them
and
from
sir
john
griffen
that
last
night
there
was
not
twelve
men
to
be
got
in
the
town
to
defend
it
which
the
master
of
the
house
tells
me
is
not
true
but
that
the
men
of
the
town
did
intend
to
stay
though
they
did
indeed
and
so
had
he
at
the
ship
removed
their
goods
thence
went
to
an
ostend
just
now
come
up
who
met
the
dutch
fleet
who
took
three
ships
that
he
came
convoying
hither
from
him
says
they
are
as
low
as
the
nore
or
thereabouts
brouncker
come
to
us
who
is
just
now
going
to
chatham
upon
a
desire
of
commissioner
pett
who
is
very
fearful
of
the
dutch
and
desires
help
for
god
and
the
king
and
kingdom
sake
so
brouncker
goes
down
and
sir
minnes
also
from
gravesend
this
morning
pett
writes
us
word
that
sheerenesse
is
lost
last
night
after
two
or
three
hours
dispute
the
enemy
hath
possessed
himself
of
that
place
which
is
very
sad
and
puts
us
into
great
fears
of
chatham
home
and
there
to
our
business
hiring
some
and
receiving
every
hour
almost
letters
from
sir
coventry
calling
for
more
and
an
order
from
council
to
enable
us
to
take
any
man
ships
and
sir
coventry
in
his
letter
to
us
says
he
do
not
doubt
but
at
this
time
under
an
invasion
as
he
owns
it
to
be
the
king
may
by
law
take
any
man
goods
at
this
business
late
and
then
home
where
a
great
deal
of
serious
talk
with
my
wife
about
the
sad
state
we
are
in
and
especially
from
the
beating
up
of
drums
this
night
for
the
upon
pain
of
death
to
appear
in
arms
morning
with
bullet
and
powder
and
money
to
supply
themselves
with
victuals
for
a
fortnight
which
considering
the
soldiers
drawn
out
to
chatham
and
elsewhere
looks
as
if
they
had
a
design
to
ruin
the
city
and
give
it
up
to
be
undone
which
i
hear
makes
the
sober
citizens
to
think
very
sadly
of
things
up
very
betimes
to
our
business
at
the
office
their
hiring
of
more
and
at
it
close
all
the
morning
at
noon
home
and
sir
pen
dined
with
us
by
and
by
after
dinner
my
wife
out
by
coach
to
see
her
mother
and
i
in
another
being
afraid
at
this
busy
time
to
be
seen
with
a
woman
in
a
coach
as
if
i
were
idle
towards
the
turner
but
met
sir
boy
and
there
in
a
letter
find
that
the
dutch
had
made
no
motion
since
their
taking
sheerenesse
and
the
duke
of
albemarle
writes
that
all
is
safe
as
to
the
great
ships
against
any
assault
the
bomb
and
chaine
being
so
fortified
which
put
my
heart
into
great
joy
when
i
come
to
sir
coventry
chamber
i
find
him
abroad
but
his
clerk
powell
do
tell
me
that
ill
news
is
come
to
court
of
the
dutch
breaking
the
chaine
at
chatham
which
struck
me
to
the
heart
and
to
white
hall
to
hear
the
truth
of
it
and
there
going
up
the
i
did
hear
some
lacquies
speaking
of
sad
news
come
to
court
saying
there
is
hardly
any
body
in
the
court
but
do
look
as
if
he
cried
i
met
roger
pepys
newly
come
out
of
the
country
in
discourse
he
told
me
that
his
grandfather
my
great
grandfather
had
per
annum
in
queene
elizabeth
time
in
the
very
town
of
cottenham
and
that
we
did
certainly
come
out
of
scotland
with
the
abbot
of
crowland
home
where
all
our
hearts
do
now
ake
for
the
news
is
true
that
the
dutch
have
broke
the
chaine
and
burned
our
ships
and
particularly
the
royal
charles
other
particulars
i
know
not
but
it
is
said
to
be
so
and
the
truth
is
i
do
fear
so
much
that
the
whole
kingdom
is
undone
that
i
do
this
night
resolve
to
study
with
my
father
and
wife
what
to
do
with
the
little
that
i
have
in
money
by
me
for
i
give
all
the
rest
that
i
have
in
the
king
hands
for
tangier
for
lost
so
god
help
us
and
god
knows
what
disorders
we
may
fall
into
and
whether
any
violence
on
this
office
or
perhaps
some
severity
on
our
persons
as
being
reckoned
by
the
silly
people
or
perhaps
may
by
policy
of
state
be
thought
fit
to
be
condemned
by
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
so
put
to
trouble
though
god
knows
i
have
in
my
own
person
done
my
full
duty
i
am
sure
no
sooner
up
but
hear
the
sad
news
confirmed
of
the
royal
charles
being
taken
by
them
and
now
in
fitting
by
them
which
pett
should
have
carried
up
higher
by
our
several
orders
and
deserves
therefore
to
be
hanged
for
not
doing
it
and
burning
several
others
and
that
another
fleet
is
come
up
into
the
hope
upon
which
news
the
king
and
duke
of
york
have
been
below
since
four
in
the
morning
to
command
the
sinking
of
ships
at
and
other
places
to
stop
their
coming
up
higher
which
put
me
into
such
a
fear
that
i
presently
resolved
of
my
father
and
wife
going
into
the
country
and
at
two
warning
they
did
go
by
the
coach
this
day
with
about
in
gold
in
their
pray
god
give
them
good
passage
and
good
care
to
hide
it
when
they
come
home
but
my
heart
is
full
of
fear
they
gone
i
continued
in
frights
and
fear
what
to
do
with
the
rest
hewer
hath
been
at
the
banker
and
hath
got
out
of
blackwell
hands
of
his
own
money
but
they
are
so
called
upon
that
they
will
be
all
broke
hundreds
coming
to
them
for
money
and
they
answer
him
it
is
payable
at
twenty
days
when
the
days
are
out
we
will
pay
you
and
those
that
are
not
so
they
make
tell
over
their
money
and
make
their
bags
false
on
purpose
to
give
cause
to
retell
it
and
so
spend
time
i
can
not
have
my
pieces
or
gold
again
for
silver
all
being
bought
up
last
night
that
were
to
be
had
and
sold
for
and
every
minute
some
one
or
other
calls
for
this
or
that
order
and
so
i
forced
to
be
at
the
office
most
of
the
day
about
the
ships
which
are
to
be
suddenly
fitted
out
and
it
a
most
strange
thing
that
we
hear
nothing
from
any
of
my
brethren
at
chatham
so
that
we
are
wholly
in
the
dark
various
being
the
reports
of
what
is
done
there
insomuch
that
i
sent
clapham
express
thither
to
see
how
matters
go
i
did
about
noon
resolve
to
send
gibson
away
after
my
wife
with
another
pieces
under
colour
of
an
express
to
sir
jeremy
smith
who
is
as
i
hear
with
some
ships
at
newcastle
which
i
did
really
send
to
him
and
may
possibly
prove
of
good
use
to
the
king
for
it
is
possible
in
the
hurry
of
business
they
may
not
think
of
it
at
court
and
the
charge
of
express
is
not
considerable
to
the
king
the
king
and
duke
of
york
up
and
down
all
the
day
here
and
there
some
time
on
tower
hill
where
the
city
militia
was
where
the
king
did
make
a
speech
to
them
that
they
should
venture
themselves
no
further
than
he
would
himself
i
also
sent
my
mind
being
in
pain
saunders
after
my
wife
and
father
to
overtake
them
at
their
night
lodging
to
see
how
matters
go
with
them
in
the
evening
i
sent
for
my
cousin
sarah
and
her
husband
who
come
and
i
did
deliver
them
my
chest
of
writings
about
brampton
and
my
brother
tom
papers
and
my
journalls
which
i
value
much
and
did
send
my
two
silver
flagons
to
kate
joyce
that
so
being
scattered
what
i
have
something
might
be
saved
i
have
also
made
a
girdle
by
which
with
some
trouble
i
do
carry
about
me
in
gold
about
my
body
that
i
may
not
be
without
something
in
case
i
should
be
surprised
for
i
think
in
any
nation
but
our
people
that
appear
for
we
are
not
indeed
so
so
faulty
as
we
would
have
their
throats
cut
in
the
evening
comes
pelling
and
several
others
to
the
office
and
tell
me
that
never
were
people
so
dejected
as
they
are
in
the
city
all
over
at
this
day
and
do
talk
most
loudly
even
treason
as
that
we
are
bought
and
sold
that
we
are
betrayed
by
the
papists
and
others
about
the
king
cry
out
that
the
office
of
the
ordnance
hath
been
so
backward
as
no
powder
to
have
been
at
chatham
nor
upner
castle
till
such
a
time
and
the
carriages
all
broken
legg
is
a
papist
william
legge
mentioned
before
he
was
treasurer
and
superintendent
of
the
ordnance
with
pay
that
upner
the
old
good
castle
built
by
queen
elizabeth
should
be
lately
slighted
that
the
ships
at
chatham
should
not
be
carried
up
higher
they
look
upon
us
as
lost
and
remove
their
families
and
rich
goods
in
the
city
and
do
think
verily
that
the
french
being
come
down
with
an
army
to
dunkirke
it
is
to
invade
us
and
that
we
shall
be
invaded
clerke
the
solicitor
comes
to
me
about
business
and
tells
me
that
he
hears
that
the
king
hath
chosen
pierpoint
and
vaughan
of
the
west
that
my
lord
chancellor
was
affronted
in
the
hall
this
day
by
people
telling
him
of
his
dunkirke
house
and
that
there
are
regiments
ordered
to
be
got
together
whereof
to
be
commanders
my
lord
fairfax
ingolsby
bethell
norton
and
birch
and
other
presbyterians
and
that
bates
will
have
liberty
to
preach
now
whether
this
be
true
or
not
i
know
not
but
do
think
that
nothing
but
this
will
unite
us
together
late
at
night
comes
hudson
the
cooper
my
neighbour
and
tells
me
that
he
come
from
chatham
this
evening
at
five
and
saw
this
afternoon
the
royal
james
oake
and
london
burnt
by
the
enemy
with
their
that
two
or
three
come
up
with
them
and
made
no
more
of
upner
castle
shooting
than
of
a
fly
that
those
ships
lay
below
but
therein
i
conceive
he
is
in
an
error
that
the
dutch
are
fitting
out
the
royall
charles
that
we
shot
so
far
as
from
the
yard
thither
so
that
the
shot
did
no
good
for
the
bullets
grazed
on
the
water
that
upner
played
hard
with
their
guns
at
first
but
slowly
afterwards
either
from
the
men
being
beat
off
or
their
powder
spent
but
we
hear
that
the
fleet
in
the
hope
is
not
come
up
any
higher
the
last
flood
and
sir
batten
tells
me
that
ships
are
provided
to
sink
in
the
river
about
woolwich
that
will
prevent
their
coming
up
higher
if
they
should
attempt
it
i
made
my
will
also
this
day
and
did
give
all
i
had
equally
between
my
father
and
wife
up
and
to
the
office
where
fryer
comes
and
tells
me
that
there
are
several
frenchman
and
flemish
ships
in
the
river
with
passes
from
the
duke
of
york
for
carrying
of
prisoners
that
ought
to
be
parted
from
the
rest
of
the
ships
and
their
powder
taken
lest
they
do
fire
themselves
when
the
enemy
comes
and
so
spoil
us
which
is
good
advice
and
i
think
i
will
give
notice
of
it
and
did
so
but
it
is
pretty
odd
to
see
how
every
body
even
at
this
high
time
of
danger
puts
business
off
of
their
own
hands
he
says
that
he
told
this
to
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
to
whom
i
for
the
same
reason
was
directing
him
to
go
and
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
bade
him
come
to
us
for
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
yesterday
comes
captain
crew
of
one
of
the
and
told
me
that
the
officers
of
the
ordnance
would
deliver
his
gunner
materials
but
not
compound
them
but
that
we
must
do
it
whereupon
i
was
forced
to
write
to
them
about
it
and
one
that
like
a
great
many
come
to
me
this
morning
by
and
by
comes
willson
and
by
direction
of
his
a
man
of
gauden
who
are
come
from
chatham
last
night
and
saw
the
three
ships
burnt
they
lying
all
dry
and
boats
going
from
the
war
to
fire
them
but
that
that
he
tells
me
of
worst
consequence
is
that
he
himself
i
think
he
said
did
hear
many
englishmen
on
board
the
dutch
ships
speaking
to
one
another
in
english
and
that
they
did
cry
and
say
we
did
heretofore
fight
for
tickets
now
we
fight
for
dollars
and
did
ask
how
such
and
such
a
one
did
and
would
commend
themselves
to
them
which
is
a
sad
consideration
and
lewes
who
was
present
at
this
discourse
to
me
did
tell
me
that
he
is
told
that
when
they
took
the
royal
charles
they
said
that
they
had
their
tickets
signed
and
showed
some
and
that
now
they
come
to
have
them
paid
and
would
have
them
paid
before
they
parted
and
several
seamen
come
this
morning
to
me
to
tell
me
that
if
i
would
get
their
tickets
paid
they
would
go
and
do
all
they
could
against
the
dutch
but
otherwise
they
would
not
venture
being
killed
and
lose
all
they
have
already
fought
for
so
that
i
was
forced
to
try
what
i
could
do
to
get
them
paid
this
man
tells
me
that
the
ships
burnt
last
night
did
lie
above
upner
castle
over
against
the
docke
and
the
boats
come
from
the
ships
of
war
and
burnt
them
all
which
is
very
sad
and
masters
of
ships
that
are
lately
taken
up
do
keep
from
their
ships
all
their
stores
or
as
much
as
they
can
so
that
we
can
dispatch
them
having
not
time
to
appraise
them
nor
secure
their
payment
only
some
little
money
we
have
which
we
are
fain
to
pay
the
men
we
have
with
every
night
or
they
will
not
work
and
indeed
the
hearts
as
well
as
affections
of
the
seamen
are
turned
away
and
in
the
open
streets
in
wapping
and
up
and
down
the
wives
have
cried
publickly
this
comes
of
your
not
paying
our
husbands
and
now
your
work
is
undone
or
done
by
hands
that
understand
it
not
and
sir
batten
told
me
that
he
was
himself
affronted
with
a
woman
in
language
of
this
kind
on
tower
hill
publickly
yesterday
and
we
are
fain
to
bear
it
and
to
keep
one
at
the
office
door
to
let
no
idle
people
in
for
fear
of
firing
of
the
office
and
doing
us
mischief
the
city
is
troubled
at
their
being
put
upon
duty
summoned
one
hour
and
discharged
two
hours
after
and
then
again
summoned
two
hours
after
that
to
their
great
charge
as
well
as
trouble
and
pelling
the
potticary
tells
me
the
world
says
all
over
that
less
charge
than
what
the
kingdom
is
put
to
of
one
kind
or
other
by
this
business
would
have
set
out
all
our
great
ships
it
is
said
they
did
in
open
streets
yesterday
at
westminster
cry
a
parliament
a
parliament
and
i
do
believe
it
will
cost
blood
to
answer
for
these
miscarriages
we
do
not
hear
that
the
dutch
are
come
to
gravesend
which
is
a
wonder
but
a
wonderful
thing
it
is
that
to
this
day
we
have
not
one
word
yet
from
brouncker
or
peter
pett
or
minnes
of
any
thing
at
chatham
the
people
that
come
hither
to
hear
how
things
go
make
me
ashamed
to
be
found
unable
to
answer
them
for
i
am
left
alone
here
at
the
office
and
the
truth
is
i
am
glad
my
station
is
to
be
here
near
my
own
home
and
out
of
danger
yet
in
a
place
of
doing
the
king
good
service
i
have
this
morning
good
news
from
gibson
three
letters
from
three
several
stages
that
we
was
safe
last
night
as
far
as
royston
at
between
nine
and
ten
at
night
the
dismay
that
is
upon
us
all
in
the
business
of
the
kingdom
and
navy
at
this
day
is
not
to
be
expressed
otherwise
than
by
the
condition
the
citizens
were
in
when
the
city
was
on
fire
nobody
knowing
which
way
to
turn
themselves
while
everything
concurred
to
greaten
the
fire
as
here
the
easterly
gale
and
for
coming
up
both
rivers
and
enabling
them
to
break
the
chaine
gauden
did
tell
me
yesterday
that
the
day
before
at
the
council
they
were
ready
to
fall
together
by
the
ears
at
the
arraigning
one
another
of
being
guilty
of
the
counsel
that
brought
us
into
this
misery
by
laying
up
all
the
great
ships
hater
tells
me
at
noon
that
some
rude
people
have
been
as
he
hears
at
my
lord
chancellor
where
they
have
cut
down
the
trees
before
his
house
and
broke
his
windows
and
a
gibbet
either
set
up
before
or
painted
upon
his
gate
and
these
three
words
writ
three
sights
to
be
seen
dunkirke
tangier
and
a
barren
queene
it
gives
great
matter
of
talk
that
it
is
said
there
is
at
this
hour
in
the
exchequer
as
much
money
as
is
ready
to
break
down
the
floor
this
arises
i
believe
from
sir
downing
late
talk
of
the
greatness
of
the
sum
lying
there
of
people
money
that
they
would
not
fetch
away
which
he
showed
me
and
a
great
many
others
most
people
that
i
speak
with
are
in
doubt
how
we
shall
do
to
secure
our
seamen
from
running
over
to
the
dutch
which
is
a
sad
but
very
true
consideration
at
this
day
at
noon
i
am
told
that
my
lord
duke
of
albemarle
is
made
lord
high
constable
the
meaning
whereof
at
this
time
i
know
not
nor
whether
it
be
true
or
no
dined
and
hater
and
hewer
with
me
where
they
do
speak
very
sorrowfully
of
the
posture
of
the
times
and
how
people
do
cry
out
in
the
streets
of
their
being
bought
and
sold
and
both
they
and
every
body
that
come
to
me
do
tell
me
that
people
make
nothing
of
talking
treason
in
the
streets
openly
as
that
they
are
bought
and
sold
and
governed
by
papists
and
that
we
are
betrayed
by
people
about
the
king
and
shall
be
delivered
up
to
the
french
and
i
know
not
what
at
dinner
we
discoursed
of
tom
of
the
wood
a
fellow
that
lives
like
a
hermit
near
woolwich
who
as
they
say
and
bodham
they
tell
me
affirms
that
he
was
by
at
the
justice
when
some
did
accuse
him
there
for
it
did
foretell
the
burning
of
the
city
and
now
says
that
a
greater
desolation
is
at
hand
thence
we
read
and
laughed
at
prophecies
this
month
in
his
almanack
this
year
so
to
the
office
after
dinner
and
thither
comes
pierce
who
tells
me
his
condition
how
he
can
not
get
his
money
about
which
he
says
is
a
very
great
part
of
what
he
hath
for
his
family
and
children
out
of
viner
hand
and
indeed
it
is
to
be
feared
that
this
will
wholly
undo
the
bankers
he
says
he
knows
nothing
of
the
late
affronts
to
my
lord
chancellor
house
as
is
said
nor
hears
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
being
made
high
constable
but
says
that
they
are
in
great
distraction
at
white
hall
and
that
every
where
people
do
speak
high
against
sir
coventry
evelyn
says
it
was
owing
to
sir
that
no
fleet
was
fitted
out
in
but
he
agrees
with
me
that
he
is
the
best
minister
of
state
the
king
hath
and
so
from
my
heart
i
believe
at
night
come
home
sir
batten
and
ben
who
only
can
tell
me
that
they
have
placed
guns
at
woolwich
and
deptford
and
sunk
some
ships
below
woolwich
and
blackwall
and
are
in
hopes
that
they
stop
the
enemy
coming
up
but
strange
our
confusion
that
among
them
that
are
sunk
they
have
gone
and
sunk
without
consideration
the
franclin
one
of
the
king
ships
with
stores
to
a
very
considerable
value
that
hath
been
long
loaded
for
supply
of
the
ships
and
the
new
ship
at
bristoll
and
much
wanted
there
and
nobody
will
own
that
they
directed
it
but
do
lay
it
on
sir
rider
they
speak
also
of
another
ship
loaded
to
the
value
of
sunk
with
the
goods
in
her
or
at
least
was
mightily
contended
for
by
him
and
a
foreign
ship
that
had
the
faith
of
the
nation
for
her
security
this
sir
ford
tells
us
and
it
is
too
plain
a
truth
that
both
here
and
at
chatham
the
ships
that
we
have
sunk
have
many
and
the
first
of
them
been
ships
completely
fitted
for
at
great
charge
but
most
strange
the
backwardness
and
disorder
of
all
people
especially
the
king
people
in
pay
to
do
any
work
sir
pen
tells
me
all
crying
out
for
money
and
it
was
so
at
chatham
that
this
night
comes
an
order
from
sir
coventry
to
stop
the
pay
of
the
wages
of
that
yard
the
duke
of
albemarle
having
related
that
not
above
three
of
in
pay
there
did
attend
to
do
any
work
there
this
evening
having
sent
a
messenger
to
chatham
on
purpose
we
have
received
a
dull
letter
from
my
lord
brouncker
and
peter
pett
how
matters
have
gone
there
this
week
but
not
so
much
or
so
particularly
as
we
knew
it
by
common
talk
before
and
as
true
i
doubt
they
will
be
found
to
have
been
but
slow
men
in
this
business
and
they
say
the
duke
of
albemarle
did
tell
my
lord
brouncker
to
his
face
that
his
discharging
of
the
great
ships
there
was
the
cause
of
all
this
and
i
am
told
that
it
is
become
common
talk
against
my
lord
brouncker
but
in
that
he
is
to
be
justified
for
he
did
it
by
verbal
order
from
sir
coventry
and
with
good
intent
and
it
was
to
good
purpose
whatever
the
success
be
for
the
men
would
have
but
spent
the
king
so
much
the
more
in
wages
and
yet
not
attended
on
board
to
have
done
the
king
any
service
and
as
an
evidence
of
that
just
now
being
the
day
in
the
morning
that
i
am
writing
yesterday
passages
one
is
with
me
jacob
bryan
purser
of
the
princesse
who
confesses
to
me
that
he
hath
but
men
borne
at
this
day
in
victuals
and
wages
on
that
ship
lying
at
chatham
being
lately
brought
in
thither
of
which
there
was
not
above
five
appeared
to
do
the
king
any
service
at
this
late
business
and
this
morning
also
some
of
the
cambridge
men
come
up
from
portsmouth
by
order
from
sir
fretcheville
hollis
who
boasted
to
us
the
other
day
that
he
had
sent
for
and
would
be
hanged
if
did
not
come
up
that
would
do
as
much
as
twice
the
number
of
other
men
i
say
some
of
them
instead
of
being
at
work
at
deptford
where
they
were
intended
do
come
to
the
office
this
morning
to
demand
the
payment
of
their
tickets
for
otherwise
they
would
they
said
do
no
more
work
and
are
as
i
understand
from
every
body
that
has
to
do
with
them
the
most
debauched
damning
swearing
rogues
that
ever
were
in
the
navy
just
like
their
prophane
commander
all
the
morning
at
the
office
no
news
more
than
last
night
only
purser
tyler
comes
and
tells
me
that
he
being
at
all
the
passages
in
this
business
at
chatham
he
says
there
have
been
horrible
miscarriages
such
as
we
shall
shortly
hear
of
that
the
want
of
boats
hath
undone
us
and
it
is
commonly
said
and
sir
minnes
under
his
hand
tells
us
that
they
were
employed
by
the
men
of
the
yard
to
carry
away
their
goods
and
i
hear
that
commissioner
pett
will
be
found
the
first
man
that
began
to
remove
he
is
much
spoken
against
and
brouncker
is
complained
of
and
reproached
for
discharging
the
men
of
the
great
ships
heretofore
at
noon
hater
dined
with
me
and
tells
me
he
believes
that
it
will
hardly
be
the
want
of
money
alone
that
will
excuse
to
the
parliament
the
neglect
of
not
setting
out
a
fleet
it
having
never
been
done
in
our
greatest
straits
but
however
unlikely
it
appeared
yet
when
it
was
gone
about
the
state
or
king
did
compass
it
and
there
is
something
in
it
roger
pepys
told
me
that
when
i
come
to
his
house
he
will
show
me
a
decree
in
chancery
wherein
there
was
men
all
keepers
in
the
town
of
cottenham
in
queene
elizabeth
time
of
our
name
by
and
by
occasion
offered
for
my
writing
to
sir
coventry
a
plain
bold
letter
touching
lack
of
money
which
when
it
was
gone
i
was
afraid
might
give
offence
but
upon
two
or
three
readings
over
again
the
copy
of
it
i
was
satisfied
it
was
a
good
letter
only
sir
batten
signed
it
with
me
which
i
could
wish
i
had
done
alone
every
moment
business
of
one
kind
or
other
about
the
ships
and
other
businesses
most
of
them
vexatious
for
want
of
money
the
commanders
all
complaining
that
if
they
miss
to
pay
their
men
a
night
they
run
away
seamen
demanding
money
of
them
by
way
of
advance
and
some
of
sir
fretcheville
hollis
men
that
he
so
bragged
of
demanding
their
tickets
to
be
paid
or
they
would
not
work
this
hollis
sir
batten
and
pen
say
proves
a
conceited
idle
prating
lying
fellow
captain
cocke
tells
me
there
have
been
great
endeavours
of
bringing
in
the
presbyterian
interest
but
that
it
will
not
do
he
named
to
me
several
of
the
insipid
lords
that
are
to
command
the
armies
that
are
to
be
raised
he
says
the
king
and
court
are
all
troubled
and
the
gates
of
the
court
were
shut
up
upon
the
first
coming
of
the
dutch
to
us
but
they
do
mind
the
business
no
more
than
ever
that
the
bankers
he
fears
are
broke
as
to
though
viner
had
by
him
when
our
trouble
begun
that
he
and
the
duke
of
albemarle
have
received
into
their
own
hands
of
viner
the
former
and
the
latter
in
tallies
or
assignments
to
secure
what
was
in
his
hands
of
theirs
and
many
other
great
men
of
our
masters
have
done
the
like
which
is
no
good
sign
when
they
begin
to
fear
the
main
he
and
every
body
cries
out
of
the
office
of
the
ordnance
for
their
neglects
both
at
gravesend
and
upner
and
every
where
else
to
the
office
and
by
and
by
word
was
brought
me
that
commissioner
pett
is
brought
to
the
tower
and
there
laid
up
close
prisoner
which
puts
me
into
a
fright
lest
they
may
do
the
same
with
us
as
they
do
with
him
great
news
of
the
blowing
up
of
one
of
the
dutch
greatest
ships
while
a
council
of
war
was
on
board
the
latter
part
i
doubt
is
not
so
it
not
being
confirmed
since
but
the
former
that
they
had
a
ship
blown
up
is
said
to
be
true
this
evening
comes
sir
carteret
to
the
office
to
talk
of
business
at
sir
batten
where
all
to
be
undone
for
want
of
money
there
being
none
to
pay
the
chest
at
their
public
pay
the
of
this
month
which
will
make
us
a
scorn
to
the
world
after
he
had
done
there
he
and
i
into
the
garden
and
walked
and
the
greatest
of
our
discourse
is
his
sense
of
the
requisiteness
of
his
parting
with
his
being
treasurer
of
the
navy
if
he
can
on
any
good
terms
he
do
harp
upon
getting
my
lord
brouncker
to
take
it
on
half
profit
but
that
he
is
not
able
to
secure
him
in
paying
him
so
much
he
tells
me
now
the
great
question
is
whether
a
parliament
or
no
parliament
and
says
the
parliament
itself
can
not
be
thought
able
at
present
to
raise
money
and
therefore
it
will
be
to
no
purpose
to
call
one
comes
an
order
from
sir
browne
commanding
me
this
afternoon
to
attend
the
with
all
my
books
and
papers
touching
the
medway
i
was
ready
to
fear
some
mischief
to
myself
though
it
appears
most
reasonable
that
it
is
to
inform
them
about
commissioner
pett
i
am
called
in
to
a
large
committee
of
the
council
present
the
duke
of
albemarle
anglesy
arlington
ashly
carteret
duncomb
coventry
ingram
clifford
lauderdale
morrice
manchester
craven
carlisle
bridgewater
john
second
earl
of
bridgewater
ob
and
after
sir
coventry
telling
them
what
orders
his
royal
highness
had
made
for
the
safety
of
the
medway
i
told
them
to
their
full
content
what
we
had
done
and
showed
them
our
letters
then
was
peter
pett
called
in
with
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
he
is
in
his
old
clothes
and
looked
most
sillily
his
charge
was
chiefly
the
not
carrying
up
of
the
great
ships
and
the
using
of
the
boats
in
carrying
away
his
goods
to
which
he
answered
very
sillily
though
his
faults
to
me
seem
only
great
omissions
lord
arlington
and
coventry
very
severe
against
him
the
former
saying
that
if
he
was
not
guilty
the
world
would
think
them
all
guilty
the
latter
urged
that
there
must
be
some
faults
and
that
the
admiral
must
be
found
to
have
done
his
part
i
did
say
an
unhappy
word
which
i
was
sorry
for
when
he
complained
of
want
of
oares
for
the
boats
and
there
was
it
seems
enough
and
good
enough
to
carry
away
all
the
boats
with
from
the
occasions
he
said
he
used
never
a
boat
till
they
were
all
gone
but
one
and
that
was
to
carry
away
things
of
great
value
and
these
were
his
models
of
ships
which
when
the
council
some
of
them
had
said
they
wished
that
the
dutch
had
had
them
instead
of
the
king
ships
he
answered
he
did
believe
the
dutch
would
have
made
more
advantage
of
the
models
than
of
the
ships
and
that
the
king
had
had
greater
loss
thereby
this
they
all
laughed
at
after
having
heard
him
for
an
hour
or
more
they
bid
him
withdraw
he
being
gone
they
caused
sir
richard
browne
to
read
over
his
minutes
and
then
my
lord
arlington
moved
that
they
might
be
put
into
my
hands
to
put
into
form
i
being
more
acquainted
with
such
business
and
they
were
so
so
i
away
back
with
my
books
and
papers
and
when
i
got
into
the
court
it
was
pretty
to
see
how
people
gazed
upon
me
that
i
thought
myself
obliged
to
salute
people
and
to
smile
lest
they
should
think
i
was
a
prisoner
too
but
afterwards
i
found
that
most
did
take
me
to
be
there
to
bear
evidence
against
pett
my
wife
did
give
me
so
bad
an
account
of
her
and
my
father
method
in
burying
of
our
gold
that
made
me
mad
and
she
herself
is
not
pleased
with
it
she
believing
that
my
sister
knows
of
it
my
father
and
she
did
it
on
sunday
when
they
were
gone
to
church
in
open
daylight
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
where
for
aught
they
knew
many
eyes
might
see
them
which
put
me
into
trouble
and
presently
cast
about
how
to
have
it
back
again
to
secure
it
here
the
times
being
a
little
better
now
barber
told
me
that
all
the
discourse
yesterday
about
that
part
of
the
town
where
he
was
was
that
pett
and
i
were
in
the
tower
and
i
did
hear
the
same
before
busy
all
the
afternoon
in
the
evening
did
treat
with
and
in
the
end
agree
but
by
some
kind
of
compulsion
with
the
owners
of
six
ships
to
serve
the
king
as
but
lord
to
see
how
against
the
hair
it
is
with
these
men
and
everybody
to
trust
us
and
the
king
and
how
unreasonable
it
is
to
expect
they
should
be
willing
to
lend
their
ships
and
lay
out
or
a
man
to
fit
their
ships
for
the
new
voyages
when
we
have
not
paid
them
half
of
what
we
owe
them
for
their
old
services
i
did
write
so
to
sir
coventry
this
night
this
day
comes
news
from
harwich
that
the
dutch
fleet
are
all
in
sight
near
sail
great
and
small
they
think
coming
towards
them
where
they
think
they
shall
be
able
to
oppose
them
but
do
cry
out
of
the
falling
back
of
the
seamen
few
standing
by
them
and
those
with
much
faintness
the
like
they
write
from
portsmouth
and
their
letters
this
post
are
worth
reading
sir
cholmly
come
to
me
this
day
and
tells
me
the
court
is
as
mad
as
ever
and
that
the
night
the
dutch
burned
our
ships
the
king
did
sup
with
my
lady
castlemaine
at
the
duchesse
of
monmouth
and
there
were
all
mad
in
hunting
of
a
poor
moth
all
the
court
afraid
of
a
parliament
but
he
thinks
nothing
can
save
us
but
the
king
giving
up
all
to
a
parliament
in
the
evening
come
captain
hart
and
hayward
to
me
about
the
six
now
taken
up
for
and
in
talking
they
told
me
about
the
taking
of
the
royal
charles
that
nothing
but
carelessness
lost
the
ship
for
they
might
have
saved
her
the
very
tide
that
the
dutch
came
up
if
they
would
have
but
used
means
and
had
had
but
boats
and
that
the
want
of
boats
plainly
lost
all
the
other
ships
that
the
dutch
did
take
her
with
a
boat
of
nine
men
who
found
not
a
man
on
board
her
and
her
laying
so
near
them
was
a
main
temptation
to
them
to
come
on
and
presently
a
man
went
up
and
struck
her
flag
and
jacke
and
a
trumpeter
sounded
upon
her
joan
placket
is
torn
placket
the
open
part
of
a
woman
petticoat
that
they
did
carry
her
down
at
a
time
both
for
tides
and
wind
when
the
best
pilot
in
chatham
would
not
have
undertaken
it
they
heeling
her
on
one
side
to
make
her
draw
little
water
and
so
carried
her
away
safe
they
being
gone
by
and
by
comes
sir
pen
who
hath
been
at
court
and
in
the
first
place
i
hear
the
duke
of
cambridge
is
dead
which
is
a
great
loss
to
the
nation
having
i
think
never
an
heyre
male
now
of
the
king
or
duke
to
succeed
to
the
crown
he
tells
me
that
they
do
begin
already
to
damn
the
dutch
and
call
them
cowards
at
white
hall
and
think
of
them
and
their
business
no
better
than
they
used
to
do
which
is
very
sad
the
king
did
tell
him
himself
which
is
so
i
was
told
here
in
the
city
that
the
city
hath
lent
him
to
be
laid
out
towards
securing
of
the
river
of
thames
which
methinks
is
a
very
poor
thing
that
we
should
be
induced
to
borrow
by
such
mean
sums
to
woolwich
and
there
called
on
bodham
and
he
and
i
to
see
the
batterys
newly
raised
which
indeed
are
good
works
to
command
the
river
below
the
ships
that
are
sunk
but
not
above
them
it
is
a
sad
sight
to
see
so
many
good
ships
there
sunk
in
the
river
while
we
would
be
thought
to
be
masters
of
the
sea
cocke
says
the
bankers
can
not
till
peace
returns
ever
hope
to
have
credit
again
so
that
they
can
pay
no
more
money
but
people
must
be
contented
to
take
publick
security
such
as
they
can
give
them
and
if
so
and
they
do
live
to
receive
the
money
thereupon
the
bankers
will
be
happy
men
fenn
read
me
an
order
of
council
passed
the
instant
directing
all
the
treasurers
of
any
part
of
the
king
revenue
to
make
no
payments
but
such
as
shall
be
approved
by
the
present
lords
commissioners
which
will
i
think
spoil
the
credit
of
all
his
majesty
service
when
people
can
not
depend
upon
payment
any
where
but
the
king
declaration
in
behalf
of
the
bankers
to
make
good
their
assignments
for
money
is
very
good
and
will
i
hope
secure
me
cocke
says
that
he
hears
it
is
come
to
it
now
that
the
king
will
try
what
he
can
soon
do
for
a
peace
and
if
he
can
not
that
then
he
will
cast
all
upon
the
parliament
to
do
as
they
see
fit
and
in
doing
so
perhaps
it
may
save
us
all
the
king
of
france
it
is
believed
is
engaged
for
this
year
so
that
we
shall
be
safe
as
to
him
the
great
misery
the
city
and
kingdom
is
like
to
suffer
for
want
of
coals
in
a
little
time
is
very
visible
and
is
feared
will
breed
a
mutiny
for
we
are
not
in
any
prospect
to
command
the
sea
for
our
colliers
to
come
but
rather
it
is
feared
the
dutch
may
go
and
burn
all
our
colliers
at
newcastle
though
others
do
say
that
they
lie
safe
enough
there
no
news
at
all
of
late
from
bredagh
what
our
treaters
do
in
the
evening
comes
povy
about
business
and
he
and
i
to
walk
in
the
garden
an
hour
or
two
and
to
talk
of
state
matters
he
tells
me
his
opinion
that
it
is
out
of
possibility
for
us
to
escape
being
undone
there
being
nothing
in
our
power
to
do
that
is
necessary
for
the
saving
us
a
lazy
prince
no
council
no
money
no
reputation
at
home
or
abroad
he
says
that
to
this
day
the
king
do
follow
the
women
as
much
as
ever
he
did
that
the
duke
of
york
hath
not
got
middleton
as
i
was
told
the
other
day
but
says
that
he
wants
not
her
for
he
hath
others
and
hath
always
had
and
that
he
hath
known
them
brought
through
the
matted
gallery
at
white
hall
into
his
closet
nay
he
hath
come
out
of
his
wife
bed
and
gone
to
others
laid
in
bed
for
him
that
brouncker
is
not
the
only
pimp
but
that
the
whole
family
are
of
the
same
strain
and
will
do
any
thing
to
please
him
that
besides
the
death
of
the
two
princes
lately
the
family
is
in
horrible
disorder
by
being
in
debt
by
spending
above
per
annum
when
he
hath
not
that
the
duchesse
is
not
only
the
proudest
woman
in
the
world
but
the
most
expensefull
and
that
the
duke
of
york
marriage
with
her
hath
undone
the
kingdom
by
making
the
chancellor
so
great
above
reach
who
otherwise
would
have
been
but
an
ordinary
man
to
have
been
dealt
with
by
other
people
and
he
would
have
been
careful
of
managing
things
well
for
fear
of
being
called
to
account
whereas
now
he
is
secure
and
hath
let
things
run
to
rack
as
they
now
appear
that
at
a
certain
time
povy
did
carry
him
an
account
of
the
state
of
the
duke
of
york
estate
showing
in
faithfullness
how
he
spent
more
than
his
estate
would
bear
by
above
per
annum
and
asked
my
lord
opinion
of
it
to
which
he
answered
that
no
man
that
loved
the
king
or
kingdom
durst
own
the
writing
of
that
paper
at
which
povy
was
started
and
reckoned
himself
undone
for
this
good
service
and
found
it
necessary
then
to
show
it
to
the
duke
of
york
commissioners
who
read
examined
and
approved
of
it
so
as
to
cause
it
to
be
put
into
form
and
signed
it
and
gave
it
to
the
duke
now
the
end
of
the
chancellor
was
for
fear
that
his
daughter
ill
housewifery
should
be
condemned
he
tells
me
that
the
other
day
upon
this
ill
news
of
the
dutch
being
upon
us
white
hall
was
shut
up
and
the
council
called
and
sat
close
and
by
the
way
he
do
assure
me
from
the
mouth
of
some
councillors
that
at
this
day
the
in
general
do
know
no
more
what
the
state
of
the
kingdom
as
to
peace
and
war
is
than
he
or
i
nor
who
manages
it
nor
upon
whom
it
depends
and
there
my
lord
chancellor
did
make
a
speech
to
them
saying
that
they
knew
well
that
he
was
no
friend
to
the
war
from
the
beginning
and
therefore
had
concerned
himself
little
in
nor
could
say
much
to
it
and
a
great
deal
of
that
kind
to
discharge
himself
of
the
fault
of
the
war
upon
which
my
lord
anglesy
rose
up
and
told
his
majesty
that
he
thought
their
coming
now
together
was
not
to
enquire
who
was
or
was
not
the
cause
of
the
war
but
to
enquire
what
was
or
could
be
done
in
the
business
of
making
a
peace
and
in
whose
hands
that
was
and
where
it
was
stopped
or
forwarded
and
went
on
very
highly
to
have
all
made
open
to
them
and
by
the
way
i
remember
that
captain
cocke
did
the
other
day
tell
me
that
this
lord
anglesy
hath
said
within
few
days
that
he
would
willingly
give
of
his
estate
that
he
was
well
secured
of
the
rest
such
apprehensions
he
hath
of
the
sequel
of
things
as
giving
all
over
for
lost
he
tells
me
speaking
of
the
horrid
effeminacy
of
the
king
that
the
king
hath
taken
ten
times
more
care
and
pains
in
making
friends
between
my
lady
castlemaine
and
stewart
when
they
have
fallen
out
than
ever
he
did
to
save
his
kingdom
nay
that
upon
any
falling
out
between
my
lady
castlemaine
nurse
and
her
women
my
lady
hath
often
said
she
would
make
the
king
to
make
them
friends
and
they
would
be
friends
and
be
quiet
which
the
king
hath
been
fain
to
do
that
the
king
is
at
this
day
every
night
in
hyde
park
with
the
duchesse
of
monmouth
or
with
my
lady
castlemaine
that
he
is
concerned
of
late
by
my
lord
arlington
in
the
looking
after
some
buildings
that
he
is
about
in
norfolke
at
euston
hall
in
suffolk
on
the
borders
of
norfolk
where
my
lord
is
laying
out
a
great
deal
of
money
and
that
he
povy
considering
the
unsafeness
of
laying
out
money
at
such
a
time
as
this
and
besides
the
enviousness
of
the
particular
county
as
well
as
all
the
kingdom
to
find
him
building
and
employing
workmen
while
all
the
ordinary
people
of
the
country
are
carried
down
to
the
sides
for
securing
the
land
he
thought
it
becoming
him
to
go
to
my
lord
arlington
sir
thomas
clifford
by
and
give
it
as
his
advice
to
hold
his
hands
a
little
but
my
lord
would
not
but
would
have
him
go
on
and
so
sir
thomas
clifford
advised
also
which
one
would
think
if
he
were
a
statesman
should
be
a
sign
of
his
foreseeing
that
all
shall
do
well
he
tells
me
that
there
is
not
so
great
confidence
between
any
two
men
of
power
in
the
nation
at
this
day
that
he
knows
of
as
between
my
lord
arlington
and
sir
thomas
clifford
and
that
it
arises
by
accident
only
there
being
no
relation
nor
acquaintance
between
them
but
only
sir
thomas
clifford
coming
to
him
and
applying
himself
to
him
for
favours
when
he
came
first
up
to
town
to
be
a
up
and
with
sir
pen
in
his
new
chariot
which
indeed
is
plain
but
pretty
and
more
fashionable
in
shape
than
any
coach
he
hath
and
yet
do
not
cost
him
harness
and
all
above
to
white
hall
where
staid
a
very
little
and
thence
to
to
sir
coventry
whom
i
have
not
seen
since
before
the
coming
of
the
dutch
into
the
river
nor
did
indeed
know
how
well
to
go
to
see
him
for
shame
either
to
him
or
me
or
both
of
us
to
find
ourselves
in
so
much
misery
i
find
that
he
and
his
treasurers
are
in
the
utmost
want
of
money
and
do
find
fault
with
sir
carteret
that
having
kept
the
mystery
of
borrowing
money
to
himself
so
long
to
the
ruin
of
the
nation
as
sir
coventry
said
in
words
to
sir
pen
and
me
he
should
now
lay
it
aside
and
come
to
them
for
money
for
every
penny
he
hath
declaring
that
he
can
raise
no
more
which
i
confess
do
appear
to
me
the
most
like
of
any
thing
that
i
have
observed
of
sir
coventry
when
he
himself
did
tell
us
on
another
occasion
at
the
same
time
that
the
bankers
who
used
to
furnish
them
money
are
not
able
to
lend
a
farthing
and
he
knows
well
enough
that
that
was
all
the
mystery
sir
carteret
did
use
that
is
only
his
credit
with
them
he
told
us
the
masters
and
owners
of
two
ships
that
i
had
complained
of
for
not
readily
setting
forth
their
ships
which
we
had
taken
up
to
make
had
been
yesterday
with
the
king
and
council
and
had
made
their
case
so
well
understood
that
the
king
did
owe
them
for
what
they
had
earned
the
last
year
and
that
they
could
not
set
them
out
again
without
some
money
or
stores
out
of
the
king
yard
the
latter
of
which
sir
coventry
said
must
be
done
for
that
they
were
not
able
to
raise
money
for
them
though
it
was
but
a
ship
which
do
show
us
our
condition
to
be
so
bad
that
i
am
in
a
total
despair
of
ever
having
the
nation
do
well
after
that
talking
awhile
and
all
out
of
heart
with
stories
of
want
of
seamen
and
seamen
running
away
and
their
demanding
a
month
advance
and
our
being
forced
to
give
seamen
to
go
hence
to
work
at
chatham
and
other
things
that
show
nothing
but
destruction
upon
us
for
it
is
certain
that
as
it
now
is
the
seamen
of
england
in
my
conscience
would
if
they
could
go
over
and
serve
the
king
of
france
or
holland
rather
than
us
up
to
the
duke
of
york
to
his
chamber
where
he
seems
to
be
pretty
easy
and
now
and
then
merry
but
yet
one
may
perceive
in
all
their
minds
there
is
something
of
trouble
and
care
and
with
good
reason
thence
to
white
hall
with
sir
pen
by
chariot
and
there
in
the
court
met
with
my
lord
anglesy
and
he
to
talk
with
sir
pen
and
told
him
of
the
masters
of
ships
being
with
the
council
yesterday
and
that
we
were
not
in
condition
though
the
men
were
willing
to
furnish
them
with
of
money
already
due
to
them
as
earned
by
them
the
last
year
to
enable
them
to
set
out
their
ships
again
this
year
for
the
king
which
he
is
amazed
at
and
when
i
told
him
my
lord
this
is
a
sad
instance
of
the
condition
we
are
in
he
answered
that
it
was
so
indeed
and
sighed
and
so
parted
and
he
up
to
the
where
i
perceive
they
sit
every
morning
it
is
worth
noting
that
the
king
and
council
in
their
order
of
the
instant
for
unloading
three
taken
up
for
the
king
service
for
do
call
the
late
coming
of
the
dutch
an
invasion
i
was
told
yesterday
that
oldenburg
henry
oldenburgh
secretary
to
the
royal
society
our
secretary
at
gresham
college
is
put
into
the
tower
for
writing
news
to
a
virtuoso
in
france
with
whom
he
constantly
corresponds
in
philosophical
matters
which
makes
it
very
unsafe
at
this
time
to
write
or
almost
do
any
thing
several
captains
come
to
the
office
yesterday
and
complaining
that
their
men
come
and
go
when
they
will
and
will
not
be
commanded
though
they
are
paid
every
night
or
may
be
nay
this
afternoon
comes
harry
russell
from
gravesend
telling
us
that
the
money
carried
down
yesterday
for
the
chest
at
chatham
had
like
to
have
been
seized
upon
yesterday
in
the
barge
there
by
seamen
who
did
beat
our
waterman
and
what
men
should
these
be
but
the
boats
crew
of
sir
fretcheville
hollis
who
used
to
brag
so
much
of
the
goodness
and
order
of
his
men
and
his
command
over
them
sir
cholmly
tells
me
great
news
that
this
day
in
council
the
king
hath
declared
that
he
will
call
his
parliament
in
thirty
days
which
is
the
best
news
i
have
heard
a
great
while
and
will
if
any
thing
save
the
kingdom
how
the
king
come
to
be
advised
to
this
i
know
not
but
he
tells
me
that
it
was
against
the
duke
of
york
mind
flatly
who
did
rather
advise
the
king
to
raise
money
as
he
pleased
and
against
the
chancellor
who
told
the
king
that
queene
elizabeth
did
do
all
her
business
in
without
calling
a
parliament
and
so
might
he
do
for
anything
he
saw
but
blessed
be
god
it
is
done
and
pray
god
it
may
hold
though
some
of
us
must
surely
go
to
the
pot
for
all
must
be
flung
up
to
them
or
nothing
will
be
done
the
parliament
is
ordered
to
meet
the
of
july
being
as
they
say
james
day
which
every
creature
is
glad
of
colonel
reymes
bullen
reymes
for
melcombe
regis
tells
me
of
a
letter
come
last
night
or
the
day
before
from
my
lord
albans
out
of
france
wherein
he
says
that
the
king
of
france
did
lately
fall
out
with
him
giving
him
ill
names
saying
that
he
had
belied
him
to
our
king
by
saying
that
he
had
promised
to
assist
our
king
and
to
forward
the
peace
saying
that
indeed
he
had
offered
to
forward
the
peace
at
such
a
time
but
it
was
not
accepted
of
and
so
he
thinks
himself
not
obliged
and
would
do
what
was
fit
for
him
and
so
made
him
to
go
out
of
his
sight
in
great
displeasure
and
he
hath
given
this
account
to
the
king
which
colonel
reymes
tells
me
puts
them
into
new
melancholy
at
court
and
he
believes
hath
forwarded
the
resolution
of
calling
the
parliament
at
white
hall
spied
povy
who
tells
me
as
a
great
secret
which
none
knows
but
himself
that
sir
carteret
hath
parted
with
his
place
of
treasurer
of
the
navy
by
consent
to
my
lord
anglesy
and
is
to
be
treasurer
of
ireland
in
his
stead
but
upon
what
terms
it
is
i
know
not
and
that
it
is
in
his
power
to
bring
me
to
as
great
a
friendship
and
confidence
in
my
lord
anglesy
as
ever
i
was
with
sir
coventry
such
is
the
want
already
of
coals
and
the
despair
of
having
any
supply
by
reason
of
the
enemy
being
abroad
and
no
fleet
of
ours
to
secure
them
that
they
are
come
this
day
to
per
chaldron
proclamations
come
out
this
day
for
the
parliament
to
meet
the
of
next
month
for
which
god
be
praised
and
another
to
invite
seamen
to
bring
in
their
complaints
of
their
being
ill
used
in
the
getting
their
tickets
and
money
pierce
tells
me
that
he
hears
for
certain
fresh
at
court
that
france
and
we
shall
agree
and
more
that
yesterday
was
damned
at
the
council
the
canary
company
and
also
that
my
lord
mordaunt
hath
laid
down
his
commission
news
this
tide
that
about
sail
of
dutch
great
and
small
were
seen
coming
up
the
river
this
morning
and
this
tide
some
of
them
to
the
upper
end
of
the
hope
we
find
the
duke
of
york
and
sir
coventry
gone
this
morning
by
two
to
chatham
to
come
home
and
it
is
fine
to
observe
how
both
the
king
and
duke
of
york
have
in
their
several
late
journeys
to
and
again
done
them
in
the
night
for
coolnesse
they
tell
me
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
hath
surrendered
himself
to
secretary
morrice
and
is
going
to
the
tower
fenn
at
the
table
says
that
he
hath
been
taken
by
the
watch
two
or
three
times
of
late
at
unseasonable
hours
but
so
disguised
that
they
could
not
know
him
and
when
i
come
home
by
and
by
lowther
tells
me
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
do
dine
publickly
this
day
at
wadlow
at
the
sun
tavern
and
is
mighty
merry
and
sent
word
to
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
that
he
would
come
to
him
as
soon
as
he
had
dined
it
is
said
that
the
king
of
france
do
make
a
sport
of
us
now
and
says
that
he
knows
no
reason
why
his
cosen
the
king
of
england
should
not
be
as
willing
to
let
him
have
his
kingdom
as
that
the
dutch
should
take
it
from
him
sir
carteret
did
tell
me
that
the
business
is
done
between
him
and
my
lord
anglesy
that
himself
is
to
have
the
other
place
of
deputy
treasurer
of
ireland
which
is
a
place
of
honour
and
great
profit
being
far
better
than
the
treasurer
my
lord
of
corke
and
to
give
the
other
his
of
treasurer
of
the
navy
that
the
king
at
his
earnest
entreaty
did
with
much
unwillingness
but
with
owing
of
great
obligations
to
him
for
his
faithfulness
and
long
service
to
him
and
his
father
grant
his
desire
my
lord
chancellor
i
perceive
is
his
friend
in
it
i
remember
i
did
in
the
morning
tell
sir
cholmly
of
this
business
and
he
answered
me
he
was
sorry
for
it
for
whatever
sir
carteret
was
he
is
confident
my
lord
anglesy
is
one
of
the
greatest
knaves
in
the
world
home
and
then
find
my
wife
making
of
tea
a
drink
which
pelling
the
potticary
tells
her
is
good
for
her
cold
and
defluxions
to
sir
batten
to
see
how
he
did
and
he
is
better
than
he
was
he
told
me
how
mrs
lowther
had
her
train
held
up
yesterday
by
her
page
at
his
house
in
the
country
which
is
ridiculous
told
us
the
news
of
the
town
how
the
officers
of
the
navy
are
cried
out
upon
and
a
great
many
greater
men
but
do
think
that
i
shall
do
well
enough
and
i
think
if
i
have
justice
i
shall
we
hear
that
the
dutch
are
gone
down
again
and
thanks
be
to
god
the
trouble
they
give
us
this
second
time
is
not
very
considerable
to
rochester
about
ten
of
the
clock
at
the
i
met
my
lord
brouncker
and
my
lord
douglas
and
all
the
officers
of
the
soldiers
in
the
town
waiting
there
for
the
duke
of
york
whom
they
heard
was
coming
by
and
by
comes
my
lord
middleton
well
mounted
he
seems
a
fine
soldier
and
so
every
body
says
he
is
and
a
man
like
my
lord
tiviott
and
indeed
most
of
the
scotch
gentry
as
i
observe
of
few
words
after
seeing
the
boats
come
up
from
chatham
with
them
that
rowed
with
bandeleeres
about
their
shoulders
and
muskets
in
their
boats
they
being
the
workmen
of
the
yard
who
have
promised
to
redeem
their
credit
lost
by
their
deserting
the
service
when
the
dutch
were
there
i
and
creed
down
by
boat
to
chatham
yard
thence
to
see
the
batteries
made
which
indeed
are
very
fine
and
guns
placed
so
as
one
would
think
the
river
should
be
very
secure
here
i
was
told
that
in
all
the
late
attempt
there
was
but
one
man
that
they
knew
killed
on
shore
and
that
was
a
man
that
had
laid
upon
his
belly
upon
one
of
the
hills
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
to
see
the
action
and
a
bullet
come
and
so
he
was
killed
thence
by
barge
it
raining
hard
down
to
the
chaine
and
in
our
way
did
see
the
sad
wrackes
of
the
poor
royall
oake
james
and
london
and
several
other
of
our
ships
by
us
sunk
and
several
of
the
enemy
whereof
three
that
they
could
not
get
off
and
so
burned
i
do
not
see
that
upner
castle
hath
received
any
hurt
by
them
though
they
played
long
against
it
and
they
themselves
shot
till
they
had
hardly
a
gun
left
upon
the
carriages
so
badly
provided
they
were
they
have
now
made
two
batteries
on
that
side
which
will
be
very
good
and
do
good
service
so
to
the
chaine
and
there
saw
it
fast
at
the
end
on
upner
side
of
the
river
very
fast
and
borne
up
upon
the
several
stages
across
the
river
and
where
it
is
broke
nobody
can
tell
me
i
went
on
shore
on
upner
side
to
look
upon
the
end
of
the
chaine
and
caused
the
link
to
be
measured
and
it
was
six
inches
and
in
circumference
it
seems
very
remarkable
to
me
and
of
great
honour
to
the
dutch
that
those
of
them
that
did
go
on
shore
to
gillingham
though
they
went
in
fear
of
their
lives
and
were
some
of
them
killed
and
notwithstanding
their
provocation
at
scelling
yet
killed
none
of
our
people
nor
plundered
their
houses
but
did
take
some
things
of
easy
carriage
and
left
the
rest
and
not
a
house
burned
and
which
is
to
our
eternal
disgrace
that
what
my
lord
douglas
men
who
come
after
them
found
there
they
plundered
and
took
all
away
and
the
watermen
that
carried
us
did
further
tell
us
that
our
own
soldiers
are
far
more
terrible
to
those
people
of
the
towns
than
the
dutch
themselves
we
were
told
at
the
batteries
upon
my
seeing
of
the
that
were
there
that
had
they
come
a
day
sooner
they
had
been
able
to
have
saved
all
but
they
had
no
orders
and
lay
lingering
upon
the
way
several
complaints
i
hear
of
the
monmouth
coming
away
too
soon
from
the
chaine
where
she
was
placed
with
the
two
to
secure
it
and
captain
robert
clerke
my
friend
is
blamed
for
so
doing
there
but
i
hear
nothing
of
him
at
london
about
it
but
captain
brookes
running
aground
with
the
sancta
maria
which
was
one
of
the
three
ships
that
were
ordered
to
be
sunk
to
have
dammed
up
the
river
at
the
chaine
is
mightily
cried
against
and
with
reason
it
is
a
strange
thing
to
see
that
while
my
lords
douglas
and
middleton
do
ride
up
and
down
upon
single
horses
my
lord
brouncker
do
go
up
and
down
with
his
hackney
coach
and
six
horses
at
the
king
charge
and
is
not
able
to
do
so
much
good
as
a
good
boatswain
in
this
business
july
to
the
office
where
pen
and
myself
and
sir
harvey
met
the
first
time
we
have
had
a
meeting
since
the
coming
of
the
dutch
upon
this
coast
sir
richard
ford
tells
us
how
he
hath
been
at
the
house
and
there
it
is
plain
that
there
is
a
combination
of
rogues
in
the
town
that
do
make
it
their
business
to
set
houses
on
fire
and
that
one
house
they
did
set
on
fire
in
street
last
easter
and
that
this
is
proved
by
two
young
men
whom
one
of
them
debauched
by
degrees
to
steal
their
plate
and
clothes
and
at
last
to
be
of
their
company
one
of
these
boys
is
a
son
of
a
montagu
of
my
lord
manchester
family
to
the
to
deliver
a
letter
to
their
lordships
about
the
state
of
the
six
merchantmen
which
we
have
been
so
long
out
when
i
come
the
king
and
the
whole
table
full
of
lords
were
hearing
of
a
pitifull
cause
of
a
complaint
of
an
old
man
with
a
great
grey
beard
against
his
son
for
not
allowing
him
something
to
live
on
and
at
last
come
to
the
ordering
the
son
to
allow
his
father
this
cause
lasted
them
near
two
hours
which
methinks
at
this
time
to
be
the
work
of
the
of
england
is
a
scandalous
thing
here
i
find
all
the
news
is
the
enemy
landing
men
near
harwich
and
attacking
landguard
fort
and
being
beat
off
thence
with
our
great
guns
killing
some
of
their
men
and
they
leaving
their
ladders
behind
them
but
we
had
no
horse
in
the
way
on
suffolke
side
otherwise
we
might
have
galled
their
foot
the
duke
of
york
is
gone
down
thither
this
day
while
the
generall
sat
sleeping
this
afternoon
at
the
to
the
where
i
have
a
mind
to
hear
bazill
fielding
case
tried
and
so
got
up
to
the
bench
my
lord
justice
keeling
sir
john
keeling
knight
king
serjeant
chief
justice
of
the
king
bench
being
judge
here
i
stood
bare
not
challenging
though
i
might
well
enough
to
be
covered
but
here
were
several
fine
trials
among
others
several
brought
in
for
making
it
their
trade
to
set
houses
on
fire
merely
to
get
plunder
and
all
proved
by
the
two
little
boys
spoken
of
yesterday
by
sir
ford
who
did
give
so
good
account
of
particulars
that
i
never
heard
children
in
my
life
one
my
lady
montagu
i
know
not
what
lady
montagu
son
and
the
other
of
good
condition
were
playing
in
and
one
rogue
gabriel
holmes
did
come
to
them
and
teach
them
to
drink
and
then
to
bring
him
plate
and
clothes
from
their
fathers
houses
and
this
gabriel
holmes
did
advise
to
have
had
two
houses
set
on
fire
one
after
another
that
while
they
were
quenching
of
one
they
might
be
burning
another
the
boys
did
swear
against
one
of
them
that
he
had
made
it
his
part
to
pull
out
the
plug
out
of
the
engine
while
it
was
and
it
really
was
so
well
this
fellow
holmes
was
found
guilty
of
the
act
of
burning
the
house
and
other
things
that
he
stood
indicted
for
it
was
time
very
well
spent
to
be
here
here
i
saw
how
favourable
the
judge
was
to
a
young
gentleman
that
struck
one
of
the
officers
for
not
making
him
room
told
him
he
had
endangered
the
loss
of
his
hand
but
that
he
hoped
he
had
not
struck
him
and
would
suppose
that
he
had
not
struck
him
the
court
then
rose
and
i
to
dinner
with
my
lord
mayor
and
sheriffs
where
a
good
dinner
and
good
discourse
the
judge
being
there
there
was
also
tried
this
morning
fielding
which
i
thought
had
been
bazill
but
it
proved
the
other
and
bazill
was
killed
that
killed
his
brother
who
was
found
guilty
of
murder
and
nobody
pitied
him
the
judge
seems
to
be
a
worthy
man
and
able
and
do
intend
for
these
rogues
that
burned
this
house
to
be
hung
in
some
conspicuous
place
in
the
town
for
an
example
williamson
told
me
that
coventry
is
coming
over
with
a
project
of
a
peace
which
if
the
states
agree
to
and
our
king
when
their
ministers
on
both
sides
have
showed
it
them
we
shall
agree
and
that
is
all
but
the
king
i
hear
do
give
it
out
plain
that
the
peace
is
concluded
this
day
with
great
satisfaction
i
hear
that
my
lady
jemimah
is
brought
to
bed
at
hinchingbroke
of
a
boy
in
created
baron
carteret
of
hawnes
bedford
in
consideration
of
the
eminent
services
rendered
by
his
grandfather
and
father
to
charles
ii
lord
day
moor
tells
me
that
the
discontented
are
fearful
that
the
next
sitting
the
king
will
try
for
a
general
excise
by
which
to
raise
him
money
and
then
to
fling
off
the
parliament
and
raise
a
and
keep
them
all
down
like
slaves
and
it
is
gotten
among
them
that
bab
may
the
hath
been
heard
to
say
that
is
enough
for
any
which
makes
them
mad
and
they
do
talk
of
or
gone
into
the
this
war
when
in
king
james
time
it
arose
but
to
and
in
king
but
in
a
year
he
tells
me
that
a
goldsmith
in
town
told
him
that
being
with
some
plate
with
my
lady
castlemaine
lately
she
directed
her
woman
the
great
beauty
willson
sayes
she
make
a
note
for
this
and
for
that
to
the
for
money
he
tells
me
a
little
more
of
the
basenesse
of
the
courses
taken
at
court
in
the
case
of
moyer
who
is
at
liberty
and
is
to
give
for
his
liberty
but
now
the
great
ones
are
divided
who
shall
have
the
money
the
duke
of
albemarle
on
one
hand
and
another
lord
on
the
other
and
that
it
is
fain
to
be
decided
by
having
the
person
name
put
into
the
warrant
for
his
liberty
at
whose
intercession
the
king
shall
own
that
he
is
set
at
liberty
which
is
a
most
lamentable
thing
that
we
do
professedly
own
that
we
do
these
things
not
for
right
and
justice
sake
but
only
to
gratify
this
or
that
person
about
the
king
god
forgive
us
all
coventry
is
come
from
bredah
as
was
expected
but
contrary
to
expectation
brings
with
him
two
or
three
articles
which
do
not
please
the
king
as
to
retrench
the
act
of
navigation
and
then
to
ascertain
what
are
contraband
goods
and
then
that
those
exiled
persons
who
are
or
shall
take
refuge
in
their
country
may
be
secure
from
any
further
prosecution
whether
these
will
be
enough
to
break
the
peace
upon
or
no
he
can
not
tell
but
i
perceive
the
certainty
of
peace
is
blown
over
to
charing
cross
there
to
see
the
great
boy
and
girle
that
are
lately
come
out
of
ireland
the
latter
eight
the
former
but
four
years
old
of
most
prodigious
bigness
for
their
age
i
tried
to
weigh
them
in
my
arms
and
and
them
twice
as
heavy
as
people
almost
twice
their
age
and
yet
i
am
apt
to
believe
they
are
very
young
their
father
a
little
sorry
fellow
and
their
mother
an
old
irish
woman
they
have
had
four
children
of
this
bigness
and
four
of
ordinary
growth
whereof
two
of
each
are
dead
if
as
my
lord
ormond
certifies
it
be
true
that
they
are
no
older
it
is
very
monstrous
this
evening
news
comes
for
certain
that
the
dutch
are
with
their
fleet
before
dover
and
that
it
is
expected
they
will
attempt
something
there
the
business
of
the
peace
is
quite
dashed
again
the
duke
of
buckingham
was
before
the
council
the
other
day
and
there
did
carry
it
very
submissively
and
pleasingly
to
the
king
but
to
my
lord
arlington
who
do
prosecute
the
business
he
was
most
bitter
and
sharp
and
very
slighting
as
to
the
letter
about
his
employing
a
man
to
cast
the
nativity
says
he
to
the
king
sir
this
is
none
of
my
hand
and
i
refer
it
to
your
majesty
whether
you
do
not
know
this
hand
the
king
answered
that
it
was
indeed
none
of
his
and
that
he
knew
whose
it
was
but
could
not
recall
it
presently
why
says
he
it
is
my
sister
of
richmond
mary
daughter
of
george
villiers
first
duke
of
buckingham
married
first
to
charles
lord
herbert
secondly
to
james
duke
of
richmond
and
lenox
and
thirdly
to
thomas
howard
brother
to
charles
earl
of
carlisle
she
left
no
issue
by
any
of
her
husbands
some
frolick
or
other
of
hers
about
some
certain
person
and
there
is
nothing
of
the
king
name
in
it
but
it
is
only
said
to
be
his
by
supposition
as
is
said
the
king
it
seems
was
not
very
much
displeased
with
what
the
duke
had
said
but
however
he
is
still
in
the
tower
and
no
discourse
of
his
being
out
in
haste
though
my
lady
caatlemaine
hath
so
far
solicited
for
him
that
the
king
and
she
are
quite
fallen
out
he
comes
not
to
her
nor
hath
for
some
three
or
four
days
and
parted
with
very
foul
words
the
king
calling
her
a
jade
that
meddled
with
things
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
at
all
and
she
calling
him
fool
and
told
him
if
he
was
not
a
fool
he
would
not
suffer
his
businesses
to
be
carried
on
by
fools
that
did
not
understand
them
and
cause
his
best
subjects
and
those
best
able
to
serve
him
to
be
imprisoned
meaning
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
it
seems
she
was
not
only
for
his
liberty
but
to
be
restored
to
all
his
places
which
it
is
thought
he
will
never
be
it
was
computed
that
the
parliament
had
given
the
king
for
this
war
only
besides
all
prizes
and
besides
the
which
he
was
to
spend
of
his
own
revenue
to
guard
the
sea
above
and
odd
which
is
a
most
prodigious
sum
it
is
strange
how
everybody
do
reflect
upon
oliver
and
commend
him
what
brave
things
he
did
and
made
all
the
neighbour
princes
fear
him
while
here
a
prince
come
in
with
all
the
love
and
prayers
and
good
liking
of
his
people
who
have
given
greater
signs
of
loyalty
and
willingness
to
serve
him
with
their
estates
that
ever
was
done
by
any
people
hath
lost
all
so
soon
that
it
is
a
miracle
what
way
a
man
could
devise
to
lose
so
much
in
so
little
time
sir
thomas
crewe
tells
me
how
i
am
mightily
in
esteem
with
the
parliament
there
being
harangues
made
in
the
house
to
the
speaker
of
pepys
readiness
and
civility
to
show
them
everything
pierce
tells
us
what
troubles
me
that
my
lord
buckhurst
hath
got
nell
away
from
the
king
house
and
gives
her
so
as
she
hath
sent
her
parts
to
the
house
and
will
act
no
more
and
yesterday
sir
thomas
crewe
told
me
that
lacy
lies
nor
will
receive
any
ghostly
advice
from
a
bishop
an
old
acquaintance
of
his
that
went
to
see
him
it
is
an
odd
and
sad
thing
to
say
that
though
this
be
a
peace
worse
than
we
had
before
yet
everybody
fear
almost
is
that
the
dutch
will
not
stand
by
their
promise
now
the
king
hath
consented
to
all
they
would
have
and
yet
no
wise
man
that
i
meet
with
when
he
comes
to
think
of
it
but
wishes
with
all
his
heart
a
war
but
that
the
king
is
not
a
man
to
be
trusted
with
the
management
of
it
it
was
pleasantly
said
by
a
man
in
this
city
a
stranger
to
one
that
told
him
the
peace
was
concluded
well
says
he
and
have
you
a
peace
yes
says
the
other
why
then
says
he
hold
your
peace
partly
reproaching
us
with
the
disgracefulness
of
it
that
it
is
not
fit
to
be
mentioned
and
next
that
we
are
not
able
to
make
the
dutch
keep
it
when
they
have
a
mind
to
break
it
to
epsum
by
eight
to
the
well
where
much
company
and
to
the
towne
to
the
king
head
and
hear
that
my
lord
buckhurst
and
nelly
are
lodged
at
the
next
house
and
sir
charles
sedley
with
them
and
keep
a
merry
house
poor
girl
i
pity
her
but
more
the
loss
of
her
at
the
king
house
here
tom
wilson
come
to
see
me
and
sat
and
talked
an
hour
and
i
perceive
he
hath
been
much
acquainted
with
fuller
tom
and
pierson
and
several
of
the
great
cavalier
parsons
during
the
late
troubles
and
i
was
glad
to
hear
him
talk
of
them
which
he
did
very
ingenuously
and
very
much
of
fuller
art
of
memory
which
he
did
tell
me
several
instances
of
by
and
by
he
parted
and
i
talked
with
the
two
women
that
farm
the
well
at
per
annum
of
the
lord
of
the
manor
evelyn
with
his
lady
and
also
my
lord
george
barkeley
lady
elizabeth
daughter
and
of
john
maasingberd
esq
and
their
fine
daughter
that
the
king
of
france
liked
so
well
and
did
dance
so
rich
in
jewells
before
the
king
at
the
ball
i
was
at
at
our
court
last
winter
and
also
their
son
a
knight
of
the
bath
charles
eldest
son
summoned
to
parliament
as
baron
berkeley
vita
patris
ob
having
succeeded
his
father
in
the
earldom
were
at
church
this
morning
i
walked
upon
the
downes
where
a
flock
of
sheep
was
and
the
most
pleasant
and
innocent
sight
that
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
we
found
a
shepherd
and
his
little
boy
reading
far
from
any
houses
or
sight
of
people
the
bible
to
him
and
we
took
notice
of
his
wooling
knit
stockings
of
two
colours
mixed
turner
mightily
pleased
with
my
resolution
which
i
tell
her
is
never
to
keep
a
but
to
keep
a
coach
and
with
my
wife
on
the
saturday
to
go
sometimes
for
a
day
to
this
place
and
then
quit
to
another
place
and
there
is
more
variety
and
as
little
charge
and
no
trouble
as
there
is
in
a
home
where
i
was
saluted
with
the
news
of
hogg
bringing
a
rich
canary
prize
to
hull
and
sir
batten
do
offer
me
down
for
my
particular
share
beside
sir
richard
part
which
do
tempt
me
but
yet
i
would
not
take
it
but
will
stand
and
fall
with
the
company
he
and
two
more
the
panther
and
fanfan
did
enter
into
consortship
and
so
they
have
all
brought
in
each
a
prize
though
ours
worth
as
much
as
both
theirs
and
more
however
it
will
be
well
worth
having
god
be
thanked
for
it
this
news
makes
us
all
very
glad
i
at
sir
batten
did
hear
the
particulars
of
it
and
there
for
joy
he
did
give
the
company
that
were
there
a
bottle
or
two
of
his
own
last
year
wine
growing
at
walthamstow
than
which
the
whole
company
said
they
never
drank
better
foreign
wine
in
their
lives
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
it
seems
set
at
liberty
without
any
further
charge
against
him
or
other
clearing
of
him
but
let
to
go
out
which
is
one
of
the
strangest
instances
of
the
play
with
which
all
publick
things
are
done
in
this
age
that
is
to
be
apprehended
and
it
is
said
that
when
he
was
charged
with
making
himself
popular
as
indeed
he
is
for
many
of
the
discontented
parliament
sir
robert
howard
and
sir
thomas
meres
and
others
did
attend
at
the
when
he
was
examined
he
should
answer
that
whoever
was
committed
to
prison
by
my
lord
chancellor
or
my
lord
arlington
could
not
want
being
popular
but
it
is
worth
considering
the
ill
state
a
minister
of
state
is
in
under
such
a
prince
as
ours
is
for
undoubtedly
neither
of
those
two
great
men
would
have
been
so
fierce
against
the
duke
of
buckingham
at
the
the
other
day
had
they
not
been
assured
of
the
king
good
liking
and
supporting
them
therein
whereas
perhaps
at
the
desire
of
my
lady
castlemaine
who
i
suppose
hath
at
last
overcome
the
king
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
well
received
again
and
now
these
men
delivered
up
to
the
interest
he
can
make
for
his
revenge
he
told
me
over
the
story
of
stewart
much
after
the
manner
which
i
was
told
it
by
evelyn
only
he
says
it
is
verily
believed
that
the
king
did
never
intend
to
marry
her
to
any
but
himself
and
that
the
duke
of
york
and
lord
chancellor
were
jealous
of
it
and
that
stewart
might
be
got
with
child
by
the
king
or
somebody
else
and
the
king
own
a
marriage
before
his
contract
for
it
is
but
a
contract
as
he
tells
me
to
this
day
with
the
queene
and
so
wipe
their
noses
of
the
crown
and
that
therefore
the
duke
of
york
and
chancellor
did
do
all
they
could
to
forward
the
match
with
my
lord
duke
of
richmond
that
she
might
be
married
out
of
the
way
but
above
all
it
is
a
worthy
part
that
this
good
lady
hath
acted
my
sister
michell
the
wife
of
balthazar
michel
pepys
brother
come
from
lee
to
see
us
but
do
tattle
so
much
of
the
late
business
of
the
dutch
coming
thither
that
i
am
weary
of
it
yet
it
is
worth
remembering
what
she
says
that
she
hath
heard
both
seamen
and
soldiers
swear
they
would
rather
serve
the
dutch
than
the
king
for
they
should
be
better
used
she
saw
the
royal
charles
brought
into
the
river
by
them
and
how
they
shot
off
their
great
guns
for
joy
when
they
got
her
out
of
chatham
river
one
tells
me
that
by
letter
from
holland
the
people
there
are
made
to
believe
that
our
condition
in
england
is
such
as
they
may
have
whatever
they
will
ask
and
that
so
they
are
mighty
high
and
despise
us
or
a
peace
with
us
and
there
is
too
much
reason
for
them
to
do
so
the
dutch
fleet
are
in
great
squadrons
everywhere
still
about
harwich
and
were
lately
at
portsmouth
and
the
last
letters
say
at
plymouth
and
now
gone
to
dartmouth
to
destroy
our
streights
fleet
lately
got
in
thither
but
god
knows
whether
they
can
do
it
any
hurt
or
no
up
to
my
lord
chancellor
where
was
a
committee
of
tangier
in
my
lord
roome
where
he
sits
to
hear
causes
and
where
all
the
judges
pictures
hung
up
very
fine
but
to
see
how
sir
coventry
did
oppose
both
my
lord
chancellor
and
the
duke
of
york
himself
about
the
order
of
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
to
me
for
not
paying
of
pensions
and
with
so
much
reason
and
eloquence
so
natural
was
admirable
and
another
thing
about
his
pressing
for
the
reduction
of
the
charge
of
tangier
which
they
would
have
put
off
to
another
time
but
says
he
the
king
suffers
so
much
by
the
putting
off
of
the
consideration
of
reductions
of
charge
that
he
is
undone
and
therefore
i
do
pray
you
sir
to
his
royal
highness
that
when
any
thing
offers
of
the
kind
you
will
not
let
it
escape
you
here
was
a
great
bundle
of
letters
brought
hither
sent
up
from
sea
from
a
vessel
of
ours
that
hath
taken
them
after
they
had
been
flung
over
by
a
dutchman
wherein
among
others
the
duke
of
york
did
read
superscription
of
one
to
de
witt
thus
to
the
most
wise
foreseeing
and
discreet
these
which
i
thought
with
myself
i
could
have
been
glad
might
have
been
duly
directed
to
any
one
of
them
at
the
table
though
the
greatest
men
in
this
kingdom
the
duke
of
york
the
lord
chancellor
my
lord
duke
of
albemarle
arlington
ashly
peterborough
and
coventry
the
best
of
them
all
for
parts
i
perceive
they
do
all
profess
their
expectation
of
a
peace
and
that
suddenly
sir
coventry
did
declare
his
opinion
that
if
tangier
were
offered
us
now
as
the
king
condition
is
he
would
advise
against
the
taking
it
saying
that
the
king
charge
is
too
great
and
must
be
brought
down
it
being
like
the
fire
of
this
city
never
to
be
mastered
till
you
have
brought
it
under
you
and
that
these
places
abroad
are
but
so
much
charge
to
the
king
and
we
do
rather
herein
strive
to
greaten
them
than
lessen
them
and
then
the
king
is
forced
to
part
with
them
as
says
he
he
did
with
dunkirke
by
my
lord
tiviott
making
it
so
chargeable
to
the
king
as
he
did
that
and
would
have
done
tangier
if
he
had
lived
i
perceive
he
is
the
only
man
that
do
seek
the
king
profit
and
is
bold
to
deliver
what
he
thinks
on
every
occasion
with
much
pleasure
reflecting
upon
our
discourse
at
the
tangier
meeting
and
crying
up
the
worth
of
sir
coventry
creed
tells
me
of
the
fray
between
the
duke
of
buckingham
at
the
duke
playhouse
the
last
saturday
and
it
is
the
first
day
i
have
heard
that
they
have
acted
at
either
the
king
or
duke
houses
this
month
or
six
weeks
and
henry
killigrew
whom
the
duke
of
buckingham
did
soundly
beat
and
take
away
his
sword
and
make
a
fool
of
till
the
fellow
prayed
him
to
spare
his
life
and
i
am
glad
of
it
for
it
seems
in
this
business
the
duke
of
buckingham
did
carry
himself
very
innocently
and
well
and
i
wish
he
had
paid
this
fellow
coat
well
i
heard
something
of
this
at
the
day
and
it
is
pretty
to
hear
how
people
do
speak
kindly
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
as
one
that
will
enquire
into
faults
and
therefore
they
do
mightily
favour
him
and
it
puts
me
in
mind
that
this
afternoon
billing
the
quaker
meeting
me
in
the
hall
come
to
me
and
after
a
little
discourse
did
say
well
says
he
now
you
will
be
all
called
to
an
account
meaning
the
parliament
is
drawing
near
by
and
by
comes
sudden
news
to
me
by
letter
from
the
clerke
of
the
cheque
at
gravesend
that
there
were
thirty
sail
of
dutch
coming
up
into
the
hope
this
last
tide
which
i
told
sir
pen
of
but
he
would
not
believe
it
but
laughed
and
said
it
was
a
fleet
of
billanders
and
that
the
guns
that
were
heard
was
the
salutation
of
the
swede
embassador
that
comes
over
with
them
but
within
half
an
hour
comes
another
letter
from
captain
proud
that
eight
of
them
were
come
into
the
hope
and
thirty
more
following
them
at
ten
this
morning
by
and
by
comes
an
order
from
white
hall
to
send
down
one
of
our
number
to
chatham
fearing
that
as
they
did
before
they
may
make
a
show
first
up
hither
but
then
go
to
chatham
so
my
lord
brouncker
do
go
and
we
here
are
ordered
to
give
notice
to
the
merchant
gone
below
the
barricado
at
woolwich
to
come
up
again
betimes
this
morning
comes
a
letter
from
the
clerk
of
the
cheque
at
gravesend
to
me
to
tell
me
that
the
dutch
fleet
did
come
all
into
the
hope
yesterday
noon
and
held
a
fight
with
our
ships
from
thence
till
seven
at
night
that
they
had
burned
twelve
and
we
took
one
of
theirs
and
burned
five
of
our
but
then
rising
and
going
to
sir
batten
he
tells
me
that
we
have
burned
one
of
their
and
another
of
theirs
is
blown
up
but
how
true
this
is
i
know
not
but
these
fellows
are
mighty
bold
and
have
had
the
fortune
of
the
wind
easterly
this
time
to
bring
them
up
and
prevent
our
troubling
them
with
our
and
indeed
have
had
the
winds
at
their
command
from
the
beginning
and
now
do
take
the
beginning
of
the
spring
as
if
they
had
some
great
design
to
do
about
five
down
to
gravesend
and
as
we
come
nearer
gravesend
we
hear
the
dutch
fleet
and
ours
their
guns
most
distinctly
and
loud
so
i
landed
and
discoursed
with
the
landlord
of
the
ship
who
undeceives
me
in
what
i
heard
this
morning
about
the
dutch
having
lost
two
for
it
is
not
so
but
several
of
their
he
do
say
that
this
afternoon
they
did
force
our
ships
to
retreat
but
that
now
they
are
gone
down
as
far
as
but
what
the
event
hath
been
of
this
evening
guns
they
know
not
but
suppose
not
much
for
they
have
all
this
while
shot
at
good
distance
one
from
another
they
seem
confident
of
the
security
of
this
town
and
the
river
above
it
if
ever
the
enemy
should
come
up
so
high
their
fortifications
being
so
good
and
guns
many
but
he
do
say
that
people
do
complain
of
sir
edward
spragg
that
he
hath
not
done
extraordinary
and
more
of
sir
jenings
that
he
came
up
with
his
tamkins
tamkin
or
tompion
the
stopple
of
a
great
gun
in
his
guns
i
demanded
of
sir
ford
and
the
rest
what
passed
at
the
meeting
of
parliament
who
told
me
that
contrary
to
all
expectation
by
the
king
that
there
would
be
but
a
thin
meeting
there
met
above
this
first
day
and
all
the
discontented
party
and
indeed
the
whole
house
seems
to
be
no
other
almost
the
speaker
told
them
as
soon
as
they
were
sat
that
he
was
ordered
by
the
king
to
let
them
know
he
was
hindered
by
some
important
business
to
come
to
them
and
speak
to
them
as
he
intended
and
therefore
ordered
him
to
move
that
they
would
adjourn
themselves
till
monday
next
it
being
very
plain
to
all
the
house
that
he
expects
to
hear
by
that
time
of
the
sealing
of
the
peace
which
by
letters
it
seems
from
my
lord
hollis
was
to
be
sealed
the
last
sunday
but
before
they
would
come
to
the
question
whether
they
would
adjourn
sir
thomas
tomkins
steps
up
and
tells
them
that
all
the
country
is
grieved
at
this
raised
and
that
they
thought
themselves
safe
enough
in
their
and
that
therefore
he
desired
the
king
might
be
moved
to
disband
them
then
rises
garraway
and
seconds
him
only
with
this
explanation
which
he
said
he
believed
the
other
meant
that
as
soon
as
peace
should
be
concluded
they
might
be
disbanded
then
rose
sir
coventry
and
told
them
that
he
did
approve
of
what
the
last
gentleman
said
but
also
that
at
the
same
time
he
did
no
more
than
what
he
durst
be
bold
to
say
he
knew
to
be
the
king
mind
that
as
soon
as
peace
was
concluded
he
would
do
it
of
himself
then
rose
sir
thomas
littleton
and
did
give
several
reasons
from
the
uncertainty
of
their
meeting
again
but
to
adjourne
in
case
news
comes
of
the
peace
being
ended
before
monday
next
and
the
possibility
of
the
king
having
some
about
him
that
may
endeavour
to
alter
his
own
and
the
good
part
of
his
advice
for
the
keeping
up
of
the
and
therefore
it
was
fit
that
they
did
present
it
to
the
king
as
their
desire
that
as
soon
as
peace
was
concluded
the
might
be
laid
down
and
that
this
their
request
might
be
carried
to
the
king
by
them
of
their
house
that
were
which
was
put
to
the
vote
and
carried
nemine
contradicente
so
after
this
vote
passed
they
adjourned
but
it
is
plain
what
the
effects
of
this
parliament
will
be
if
they
be
suffered
to
sit
that
they
will
fall
foul
upon
the
faults
of
the
government
and
i
pray
god
they
may
be
permitted
to
do
it
for
nothing
else
i
fear
will
save
the
king
and
kingdom
than
the
doing
it
betimes
to
the
office
where
i
hear
that
sir
john
coventry
nephew
to
sir
william
and
henry
coventry
created
at
charles
ii
coronation
and
for
weymouth
in
several
parliaments
the
outrage
committed
on
his
person
by
sir
thomas
sandys
and
others
who
cut
his
nose
to
the
bone
gave
rise
to
the
passing
a
bill
still
known
by
the
name
of
the
coventry
act
is
come
over
from
bredagh
a
nephew
i
think
of
sir
coventry
but
what
message
he
brings
i
know
not
this
morning
news
is
come
that
sir
jos
jordan
is
come
from
harwich
with
sixteen
and
four
other
little
ships
of
war
and
did
attempt
to
do
some
execution
upon
the
enemy
but
did
it
without
discretion
as
most
do
say
so
as
they
have
been
able
to
do
no
good
but
have
lost
four
of
their
they
attempted
this
it
seems
when
the
wind
was
too
strong
that
our
grapplings
could
not
hold
others
say
we
came
to
leeward
of
them
but
all
condemn
it
as
a
foolish
management
they
are
come
to
sir
edward
spragg
about
lee
and
the
dutch
are
below
at
the
nore
at
the
office
all
the
morning
and
at
noon
to
the
where
i
met
fenn
and
he
tells
me
that
sir
john
coventry
do
bring
the
confirmation
of
the
peace
but
i
do
not
find
the
at
all
glad
of
it
but
rather
the
worse
they
looking
upon
it
as
a
peace
made
only
to
preserve
the
king
for
a
time
in
his
lusts
and
ease
and
to
sacrifice
trade
and
his
kingdoms
only
to
his
own
pleasures
so
that
the
hearts
of
merchants
are
quite
down
he
tells
me
that
the
king
and
my
lady
castlemaine
are
quite
broke
off
and
she
is
gone
away
and
is
with
child
and
swears
the
king
shall
own
it
and
she
will
have
it
christened
in
the
chapel
at
white
hall
so
and
owned
for
the
king
as
other
kings
have
done
or
she
will
bring
it
into
white
hall
gallery
and
dash
the
brains
of
it
out
before
the
king
face
he
tells
me
that
the
king
and
court
were
never
in
the
world
so
bad
as
they
are
now
for
gaming
swearing
women
and
drinking
and
the
most
abominable
vices
that
ever
were
in
the
world
so
that
all
must
come
to
nought
he
told
me
that
sir
carteret
was
at
this
end
of
the
town
so
i
went
to
visit
him
in
and
there
he
and
i
together
and
he
is
mightily
pleased
with
my
lady
jem
having
a
son
and
a
mighty
glad
man
he
is
he
tells
me
as
to
news
that
the
peace
is
now
confirmed
and
all
that
over
he
says
it
was
a
very
unhappy
motion
in
the
house
the
other
day
about
the
for
whether
the
king
hath
a
mind
of
his
own
to
do
the
thing
desired
or
no
his
doing
it
will
be
looked
upon
as
a
thing
done
only
in
fear
of
the
parliament
he
says
that
the
duke
of
york
is
suspected
to
be
the
great
man
that
is
for
raising
this
army
and
bringing
things
to
be
commanded
by
an
army
but
that
he
do
know
that
he
is
wronged
therein
he
do
say
that
the
court
is
in
a
way
to
ruin
all
for
their
pleasures
and
says
that
he
himself
hath
once
taken
the
liberty
to
tell
the
king
the
necessity
of
having
at
least
a
show
of
religion
in
the
government
and
sobriety
and
that
it
was
that
that
did
set
up
and
keep
up
oliver
though
he
was
the
greatest
rogue
in
the
world
he
tells
me
the
king
adheres
to
no
man
but
this
day
delivers
himself
up
to
this
and
the
next
to
that
to
the
ruin
of
himself
and
business
that
he
is
at
the
command
of
any
woman
like
a
slave
though
he
be
the
best
man
to
the
queene
in
the
world
with
so
much
respect
and
never
lies
a
night
from
her
but
yet
can
not
command
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
woman
he
likes
it
raining
this
day
all
day
to
our
great
joy
it
having
not
rained
i
think
this
month
before
so
as
the
ground
was
every
where
so
burned
and
dry
as
could
be
and
no
travelling
in
the
road
or
streets
in
london
for
dust
all
the
morning
close
to
draw
up
a
letter
to
sir
coventry
upon
the
tidings
of
peace
taking
occasion
before
i
am
forced
to
it
to
resign
up
to
his
royall
highness
my
place
of
the
victualling
and
to
recommend
myself
to
him
by
promise
of
doing
my
utmost
to
improve
this
peace
in
the
best
manner
we
may
to
save
the
kingdom
from
ruin
up
and
with
sir
batten
to
james
to
sir
coventry
chamber
where
among
other
things
he
came
to
me
and
told
me
that
he
had
received
my
yesterday
letters
and
that
we
concurred
very
well
in
our
notions
and
that
as
to
my
place
which
i
had
offered
to
resign
of
the
victualling
he
had
drawn
up
a
letter
at
the
same
time
for
the
duke
of
york
signing
for
the
like
places
in
general
raised
during
this
war
and
that
he
had
done
me
right
to
the
duke
of
york
to
let
him
know
that
i
had
of
my
own
accord
offered
to
resign
mine
the
letter
do
bid
us
to
do
all
things
particularizing
several
for
the
laying
up
of
the
ships
and
easing
the
king
of
charge
so
that
the
war
is
now
professedly
over
by
and
by
up
to
the
duke
of
york
chamber
and
there
all
the
talk
was
about
jordan
coming
with
so
much
indiscretion
with
his
four
little
frigates
and
sixteen
ships
from
harwich
to
annoy
the
enemy
his
failures
were
of
several
sorts
i
know
not
which
the
truest
that
he
came
with
so
strong
a
gale
of
wind
that
his
grapplings
would
not
hold
that
he
did
come
by
their
lee
whereas
if
he
had
come
athwart
their
hawse
they
would
have
held
that
they
did
not
stop
a
tide
and
ebb
up
with
a
windward
tide
and
then
they
would
have
come
so
fast
now
there
happened
to
be
captain
jenifer
by
who
commanded
the
lily
in
this
business
and
thus
says
that
finding
the
dutch
not
so
many
as
they
expected
they
did
not
know
that
there
were
more
of
them
above
and
so
were
not
so
earnest
to
the
setting
upon
these
that
they
did
do
what
they
could
to
make
the
ships
fall
in
among
the
enemy
and
for
their
lives
sir
jordan
nor
others
could
by
shooting
several
times
at
them
make
them
go
in
and
it
seems
they
were
commanded
by
some
idle
fellows
such
as
they
could
of
a
sudden
gather
up
at
harwich
which
is
a
sad
consideration
that
at
such
a
time
as
this
where
the
saving
the
reputation
of
the
whole
nation
lay
at
stake
and
after
so
long
a
war
the
king
had
not
credit
to
gather
a
few
able
men
to
command
these
vessels
he
says
that
if
they
had
come
up
slower
the
enemy
would
with
their
boats
and
their
great
sloops
which
they
have
to
row
with
a
great
many
men
and
did
come
and
cut
up
several
of
our
and
would
certainly
have
taken
most
of
them
for
they
do
come
with
a
great
provision
of
these
boats
on
purpose
and
to
save
their
men
which
is
bravely
done
of
them
though
they
did
on
this
very
occasion
show
great
fear
as
they
say
by
some
men
leaping
overboard
out
of
a
great
ship
as
these
were
all
of
them
of
sixty
and
seventy
guns
which
one
of
our
laid
on
board
though
the
fire
did
not
take
but
yet
it
is
brave
to
see
what
care
they
do
take
to
encourage
their
men
to
provide
great
stores
of
boats
to
save
them
while
we
have
not
credit
to
find
one
boat
for
a
ship
and
further
he
told
us
that
this
new
way
used
by
deane
and
this
sir
coventry
observed
several
times
of
preparing
of
do
not
do
the
work
for
the
fire
not
being
strong
and
quick
enough
to
flame
up
so
as
to
take
the
rigging
and
sails
lies
smothering
a
great
while
half
an
hour
before
it
flames
in
which
time
they
can
get
the
off
safely
though
which
is
uncertain
and
did
fail
in
one
or
two
this
bout
it
do
serve
to
burn
our
own
ships
but
what
a
shame
it
is
to
consider
how
two
of
our
companies
did
desert
their
ships
for
fear
of
being
taken
by
their
boats
our
little
frigates
being
forced
to
leave
them
being
chased
by
their
greater
and
one
more
company
did
set
their
ship
on
fire
and
leave
her
which
afterwards
a
feversham
fisherman
came
up
to
and
put
out
the
fire
and
carried
safe
into
feversham
where
she
now
is
which
was
observed
by
the
duke
of
york
and
all
the
company
with
him
that
it
was
only
want
of
courage
and
a
general
dismay
and
abjectness
of
spirit
upon
all
our
men
and
others
did
observe
our
ill
management
and
god
almighty
curse
upon
all
that
we
have
in
hand
for
never
such
an
opportunity
was
of
destroying
so
many
good
ships
of
theirs
as
we
now
had
but
to
see
how
negligent
we
were
in
this
business
that
our
fleet
of
jordan
should
not
have
any
notice
where
spragg
was
nor
spragg
of
jordan
so
as
to
be
able
to
meet
and
join
in
the
business
and
help
one
another
but
jordan
when
he
saw
spragg
fleet
above
did
think
them
to
be
another
part
of
the
enemy
fleet
while
on
the
other
side
notwithstanding
our
people
at
court
made
such
a
secret
of
jordan
design
that
nobody
must
know
it
and
even
this
office
itself
must
not
know
it
nor
for
my
part
i
did
not
though
sir
batten
says
by
discourse
to
him
he
had
heard
something
of
it
yet
de
ruyter
or
he
that
commanded
this
fleet
had
notice
of
it
and
told
it
to
a
fisherman
of
ours
that
he
took
and
released
on
thursday
last
which
was
the
day
before
our
fleet
came
to
him
but
then
that
that
seems
most
to
our
disgrace
and
which
the
duke
of
york
did
take
special
and
vehement
notice
of
is
that
when
the
dutch
saw
so
many
provided
for
them
themselves
lying
i
think
about
the
nore
they
did
with
all
their
great
ships
with
a
wind
as
i
take
it
they
said
but
whatever
it
was
it
was
a
wind
that
we
should
not
have
done
it
with
turn
down
to
the
which
the
duke
of
york
observed
never
was
nor
would
have
been
undertaken
by
ourselves
and
whereas
some
of
the
company
answered
it
was
their
great
fear
not
their
choice
that
made
them
do
it
the
duke
of
york
answered
that
it
was
it
maybe
their
fear
and
wisdom
that
made
them
do
it
but
yet
their
fear
did
not
make
them
mistake
as
we
should
have
done
when
we
have
had
no
fear
upon
us
and
have
run
our
ships
on
ground
and
this
brought
it
into
my
mind
that
they
managed
their
retreat
down
this
difficult
passage
with
all
their
fear
better
than
we
could
do
ourselves
in
the
main
sea
when
the
duke
of
albemarle
ran
away
from
the
dutch
when
the
prince
was
lost
and
the
royal
charles
and
the
other
great
ships
came
on
ground
upon
the
galloper
thus
in
all
things
in
wisdom
courage
force
knowledge
of
our
own
streams
and
success
the
dutch
have
the
best
of
us
and
do
end
the
war
with
victory
on
their
side
one
thing
extraordinary
was
this
day
a
man
a
quaker
came
naked
through
the
hall
only
very
civilly
tied
about
the
loins
to
avoid
scandal
and
with
a
of
fire
and
brimstone
burning
upon
his
head
did
pass
through
the
hall
crying
repent
repent
presently
comes
down
the
house
of
commons
the
king
having
made
a
very
short
and
no
pleasing
speech
to
them
at
all
not
at
all
giving
them
thanks
for
their
readiness
to
come
up
to
town
at
this
busy
time
but
told
them
that
he
did
think
he
should
have
had
occasion
for
them
but
had
none
and
therefore
did
dismiss
them
to
look
after
their
own
occasions
till
october
and
that
he
did
wonder
any
should
offer
to
bring
in
a
suspicion
that
he
intended
to
rule
by
an
army
or
otherwise
than
by
the
laws
of
the
land
which
he
promised
them
he
would
do
and
so
bade
them
go
home
and
settle
the
minds
of
the
country
in
that
particular
and
only
added
that
he
had
made
a
peace
which
be
did
believe
they
would
find
reasonable
and
a
good
peace
but
did
give
them
none
of
the
particulars
thereof
thus
they
are
dismissed
again
to
their
general
great
distaste
i
believe
the
greatest
that
ever
parliament
was
to
see
themselves
so
fooled
and
the
nation
in
certain
condition
of
ruin
while
the
king
they
see
is
only
governed
by
his
lust
and
women
and
rogues
about
him
the
speaker
they
found
was
kept
from
coming
in
the
morning
to
the
house
on
purpose
till
after
the
king
was
come
to
the
house
of
lords
for
fear
they
should
be
doing
any
thing
in
the
house
of
commons
to
the
further
dissatisfaction
of
the
king
and
his
courtiers
they
do
all
give
up
the
kingdom
for
lost
that
i
speak
to
and
do
hear
what
the
king
says
how
he
and
the
duke
of
york
do
do
what
they
can
to
get
up
an
army
that
they
may
need
no
more
parliaments
and
how
my
lady
castlemaine
hath
before
the
last
breach
between
her
and
the
king
said
to
the
king
that
he
must
rule
by
an
army
or
all
would
be
lost
i
am
told
that
many
petitions
were
provided
for
the
parliament
complaining
of
the
wrongs
they
have
received
from
the
court
and
courtiers
in
city
and
country
if
the
parliament
had
but
sat
and
i
do
perceive
they
all
do
resolve
to
have
a
good
account
of
the
money
spent
before
ever
they
give
a
farthing
more
and
the
whole
kingdom
is
every
where
sensible
of
their
being
abused
insomuch
that
they
forced
their
to
come
up
to
sit
and
my
cozen
roger
told
me
that
but
that
was
in
mirth
he
believed
if
he
had
not
come
up
he
should
have
had
his
house
burned
the
kingdom
never
in
so
troubled
a
condition
in
this
world
as
now
nobody
pleased
with
the
peace
and
yet
nobody
daring
to
wish
for
the
continuance
of
the
war
it
being
plain
that
nothing
do
nor
can
thrive
under
us
here
i
saw
old
good
vaughan
and
several
of
the
great
men
of
the
commons
and
some
of
them
old
men
that
are
come
miles
and
more
to
attend
this
session
of
parliament
and
have
been
at
great
charge
and
disappointments
in
their
other
private
business
and
now
all
to
no
purpose
neither
to
serve
their
country
content
themselves
nor
receive
any
thanks
from
the
king
it
is
verily
expected
by
many
of
them
that
the
king
will
continue
the
prorogation
in
october
so
as
if
it
be
possible
never
to
have
this
parliament
more
my
lord
bristoll
took
his
place
in
the
house
of
lords
this
day
but
not
in
his
robes
and
when
the
king
came
in
he
withdrew
but
my
lord
of
buckingham
was
there
as
brisk
as
ever
and
sat
in
his
robes
which
is
a
monstrous
thing
that
a
man
should
be
proclaimed
against
and
put
in
the
tower
and
released
without
any
trial
and
yet
not
restored
to
his
places
but
above
all
i
saw
my
lord
mordaunt
vide
note
as
merry
as
the
best
that
it
seems
hath
done
such
further
indignities
to
taylor
since
the
last
sitting
of
parliament
as
would
hang
him
if
there
were
nothing
else
would
the
king
do
what
were
fit
for
him
but
nothing
of
that
is
now
likely
to
be
cozen
roger
and
creed
to
dinner
with
me
and
very
merry
but
among
other
things
they
told
me
of
the
strange
bold
sermon
of
creeton
probably
robert
creyghton
of
trin
cambridge
ling
graec
reg
yesterday
before
the
king
how
he
preached
against
the
sins
of
the
court
and
particularly
against
adultery
over
and
over
instancing
how
for
that
single
sin
in
david
the
whole
nation
was
undone
and
of
our
negligence
in
having
our
castles
without
ammunition
and
powder
when
the
dutch
came
upon
us
and
how
we
have
no
courage
but
let
our
ships
be
taken
out
of
our
harbour
here
creed
did
tell
us
the
story
of
the
duell
last
night
in
between
sir
bellasses
and
tom
porter
it
is
worth
remembering
the
silliness
of
the
quarrel
and
is
a
kind
of
emblem
of
the
general
complexion
of
this
whole
kingdom
at
present
they
two
dined
yesterday
at
sir
robert
carr
knight
and
baronet
of
sleaford
lincolnshire
and
one
of
the
proposed
knights
of
the
royal
oak
for
that
county
where
it
seems
people
do
drink
high
all
that
come
it
happened
that
these
two
the
greatest
friends
in
the
world
were
talking
together
and
sir
bellasses
talked
a
little
louder
than
ordinary
to
tom
porter
giving
of
him
some
advice
some
of
the
company
standing
by
said
what
are
they
quarrelling
that
they
talk
so
high
sir
bellasses
hearing
it
said
no
says
he
i
would
have
you
know
i
never
quarrel
but
i
strike
and
take
that
as
a
rule
of
mine
how
says
tom
porter
strike
i
would
i
could
see
the
man
in
england
that
durst
give
me
a
blow
with
that
sir
bellasses
did
give
him
a
box
of
the
ears
and
so
they
were
going
to
fight
there
but
were
hindered
and
by
and
by
tom
porter
went
out
and
meeting
dryden
the
poet
told
him
of
the
business
and
that
he
was
resolved
to
fight
sir
bellasses
presently
for
he
knew
if
he
did
not
they
should
be
friends
and
then
the
blow
would
rest
upon
him
which
he
would
prevent
and
desired
dryden
to
let
him
have
his
boy
to
bring
him
notice
which
way
sir
bellasses
goes
by
and
by
he
is
informed
that
sir
bellasses
coach
was
coming
so
tom
porter
went
down
out
of
the
where
he
stayed
for
the
tidings
and
stopped
the
coach
and
bade
sir
bellasses
come
out
why
says
bellasses
you
will
not
hurt
me
coming
you
no
says
tom
porter
so
out
he
went
and
both
drew
and
bellasses
having
drawn
and
flung
away
his
scabbard
tom
porter
asked
him
whether
he
was
ready
the
other
answering
him
he
was
they
fell
to
fight
some
of
their
acquaintance
by
they
wounded
one
another
and
bellasses
so
much
that
it
is
feared
he
will
die
and
finding
himself
severely
wounded
he
called
to
tom
porter
and
kissed
him
and
bade
him
shift
for
himself
for
says
he
tom
thou
hast
hurt
me
but
i
will
make
shift
to
stand
upon
my
legs
till
thou
mayest
withdraw
and
the
world
not
take
notice
of
you
for
i
would
not
have
thee
troubled
for
what
thou
hast
done
and
so
whether
he
did
fly
or
no
i
can
not
tell
but
tom
porter
showed
bellasses
that
he
was
wounded
too
and
they
are
both
ill
but
bellasses
to
fear
of
life
and
this
is
a
fine
example
and
bellasses
a
too
and
both
of
them
extraordinary
friends
among
other
discourse
my
cosen
roger
told
us
a
thing
certain
that
my
lady
castlemaine
hath
made
a
bishop
lately
namely
her
uncle
glenham
henry
glenham
was
dean
of
bristol
but
i
believe
never
raised
to
the
bench
who
i
think
they
say
is
bishop
of
carlisle
a
drunken
swearing
rascal
and
a
scandal
to
the
church
and
do
now
pretend
to
be
bishop
of
lincoln
in
competition
with
raynbow
rainbow
was
bishop
of
carlisle
from
to
who
is
reckoned
as
worthy
a
man
as
most
in
the
church
for
piety
and
learning
which
are
things
so
scandalous
to
consider
that
no
man
can
doubt
but
we
must
be
undone
that
hears
of
them
cosen
roger
did
acquaint
me
in
private
with
an
offer
made
of
his
marrying
of
elizabeth
wiles
whom
i
know
a
kinswoman
of
honiwood
an
ugly
old
maid
but
good
housewife
and
is
said
to
have
to
her
portion
though
i
am
against
it
in
my
heart
she
being
not
handsome
at
all
and
it
hath
been
the
very
bad
fortune
of
the
pepyses
that
ever
i
knew
never
to
marry
an
handsome
woman
excepting
ned
pepys
to
white
hall
and
looking
out
of
the
window
into
the
garden
i
saw
the
king
whom
i
have
not
had
any
desire
to
see
since
the
dutch
came
upon
the
coast
first
to
sheerness
for
shame
that
i
should
see
him
or
he
me
methinks
after
such
a
dishonour
come
upon
the
garden
with
him
two
or
three
idle
lords
and
instantly
after
him
in
another
walk
my
lady
castlemaine
led
by
bab
may
at
which
i
was
surprised
having
but
newly
heard
the
stories
of
the
king
and
her
being
parted
for
ever
so
i
took
povy
who
was
there
aside
and
he
told
me
all
how
imperious
this
woman
is
and
hectors
the
king
to
whatever
she
will
it
seems
she
is
with
child
and
the
king
says
he
did
not
get
it
with
that
she
made
a
slighting
puh
with
her
mouth
and
went
out
of
the
house
and
never
came
in
again
till
the
king
went
to
sir
daniel
harvy
to
pray
her
and
so
she
is
come
when
one
would
think
his
mind
should
be
full
of
some
other
cares
having
but
this
morning
broken
up
such
a
parliament
with
so
much
discontent
and
so
many
wants
upon
him
and
but
yesterday
heard
such
a
sermon
against
adultery
but
it
seems
she
hath
told
the
king
that
whoever
did
get
it
he
should
own
it
and
the
bottom
of
the
quarrel
is
this
she
is
fallen
in
love
with
young
jermin
who
hath
of
late
been
with
her
oftener
than
the
king
and
is
now
going
to
marry
my
lady
falmouth
lady
falmouth
married
the
earl
of
dorset
the
king
is
mad
at
her
entertaining
jermin
and
she
is
mad
at
jermin
going
to
marry
from
her
so
they
are
all
mad
and
thus
the
kingdom
is
governed
but
he
tells
me
for
certain
that
nothing
is
more
sure
than
that
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
the
chancellor
are
desirous
and
labouring
all
they
can
to
get
an
army
whatever
the
king
says
to
the
parliament
and
he
believes
that
they
are
at
last
resolved
to
stand
and
fall
all
three
together
so
that
he
says
in
terms
that
the
match
of
the
duke
of
york
with
the
chancellor
daughter
hath
undone
the
nation
he
tells
me
also
that
the
king
hath
not
greater
enemies
in
the
world
than
those
of
his
own
family
for
there
is
not
an
officer
in
the
house
almost
but
curses
him
for
letting
them
starve
and
there
is
not
a
farthing
of
money
to
be
raised
for
the
buying
them
bread
to
the
where
i
did
speak
with
the
lords
here
i
do
hear
that
there
are
three
lords
more
to
be
added
to
them
my
lord
bridgewater
my
lord
anglesy
and
my
lord
chamberlaine
cooling
told
as
how
the
king
once
speaking
of
the
duke
of
york
being
mastered
by
his
wife
said
to
some
of
the
company
by
that
he
would
go
no
more
abroad
with
this
tom
otter
meaning
the
duke
of
york
and
his
wife
vide
the
play
of
epicene
or
the
silent
woman
in
which
mrs
otter
thus
addresses
her
henpecked
husband
thomas
otter
is
this
according
to
the
instrument
when
i
married
you
that
i
would
be
princess
and
reign
in
my
own
house
and
you
would
be
my
subject
and
obey
me
act
scene
tom
killigrew
being
by
said
sir
pray
which
is
the
best
for
a
man
to
be
a
tom
otter
to
his
wife
or
to
his
mistress
meaning
the
king
being
so
to
my
lady
castlemaine
to
marrowbone
where
my
lord
mayor
and
aldermen
it
seems
dined
and
were
just
now
going
away
methought
in
a
disconsolate
condition
compared
with
their
splendour
they
formerly
had
when
the
city
was
standing
august
home
the
gates
of
the
city
shut
it
being
so
late
and
at
newgate
we
find
them
in
trouble
some
thieves
having
this
night
broke
open
prison
to
the
office
there
to
enable
myself
by
finishing
our
great
account
to
give
it
to
the
lords
commissioners
of
the
treasury
which
i
did
and
there
was
called
in
to
them
to
tell
them
only
the
total
of
our
debt
of
the
navy
on
the
of
may
last
which
is
above
here
i
find
them
mighty
hot
in
their
answer
to
the
about
our
threepences
of
the
victualling
and
also
against
the
present
farm
of
the
customes
which
they
do
most
highly
inveigh
against
i
hear
the
ill
news
of
our
loss
lately
of
four
rich
ships
two
from
guinea
one
from
gallipoly
all
with
rich
oyles
and
the
other
from
barbadoes
worth
as
is
guessed
but
here
is
strong
talk
as
if
harman
had
taken
some
of
the
dutch
east
india
ships
but
i
dare
not
yet
believe
it
and
brought
them
into
lisbon
to
the
duke
of
york
house
and
there
saw
love
trickes
or
the
school
of
compliments
a
comedy
by
james
shirley
a
silly
play
only
miss
davis
dancing
in
a
clothes
did
please
us
mightily
a
full
board
here
talking
of
news
my
lord
anglesy
did
tell
us
that
the
dutch
do
make
a
further
bogle
with
us
about
two
or
three
things
which
they
will
be
satisfied
in
he
says
by
us
easily
but
only
in
one
it
seems
they
do
demand
that
we
shall
not
interrupt
their
east
indiamen
coming
home
and
of
which
they
are
in
some
fear
and
we
are
full
of
hopes
that
we
have
light
upon
some
of
them
and
carried
them
into
lisbon
by
harman
which
god
send
but
they
which
do
show
the
low
esteem
they
have
of
us
have
the
confidence
to
demand
that
we
shall
have
a
cessation
on
our
parts
and
yet
they
at
liberty
to
take
what
they
will
which
is
such
an
affront
as
another
can
not
be
devised
greater
though
the
king
and
my
lady
castlemaine
are
friends
again
she
is
not
at
white
hall
but
at
sir
harvy
whither
the
king
goes
to
her
and
he
says
she
made
him
ask
her
forgiveness
upon
his
knees
and
promised
to
offend
her
no
more
so
and
that
indeed
she
did
threaten
to
bring
all
his
bastards
to
his
closet
door
and
hath
nearly
hectored
him
out
of
his
wits
sir
henry
bellasses
is
dead
of
the
duell
he
fought
about
ten
days
ago
with
tom
porter
and
it
is
pretty
to
see
how
the
world
talk
of
them
as
of
a
couple
of
fools
that
killed
one
another
out
of
love
i
to
my
bookseller
where
by
and
by
i
met
evelyn
and
talked
of
several
things
but
particularly
of
the
times
and
he
tells
me
that
wise
men
do
prepare
to
remove
abroad
what
they
have
for
that
we
must
be
ruined
our
case
being
past
relief
the
kingdom
so
much
in
debt
and
the
king
minding
nothing
but
his
lust
going
two
days
to
see
my
lady
castlemaine
at
sir
harvy
to
james
and
there
met
sir
coventry
and
he
and
i
walked
in
the
park
an
hour
and
then
to
his
chamber
where
he
read
to
me
the
heads
of
the
late
great
dispute
between
him
and
the
rest
of
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
and
our
new
treasurer
of
the
navy
where
they
have
overthrown
him
the
last
wednesday
in
the
great
dispute
touching
his
having
the
payment
of
the
victualler
which
is
now
settled
by
council
that
he
is
not
to
have
it
and
indeed
they
have
been
most
just
as
well
as
most
severe
and
bold
in
the
doing
this
against
a
man
of
his
quality
but
i
perceive
he
does
really
make
no
difference
between
any
man
he
tells
me
this
day
it
is
supposed
the
peace
is
ratified
at
bredah
and
all
that
matter
over
we
did
talk
of
many
retrenchments
of
charge
of
the
navy
which
he
will
put
in
practice
and
every
where
else
though
he
tells
me
he
despairs
of
being
able
to
do
what
ought
to
be
done
for
the
saving
of
the
kingdom
which
i
tell
him
indeed
all
the
world
is
almost
in
hopes
of
upon
the
proceeding
of
these
gentlemen
for
the
regulating
of
the
treasury
it
being
so
late
and
our
poverty
grown
so
great
that
they
want
where
to
set
their
feet
to
begin
to
do
any
thing
he
tells
me
how
weary
he
hath
for
this
year
and
a
half
been
of
the
warr
and
how
in
the
duke
of
york
bedchamber
at
christ
church
at
oxford
when
the
court
was
there
he
did
labour
to
persuade
the
duke
to
fling
off
the
care
of
the
navy
and
get
it
committed
to
other
hands
which
if
he
had
done
would
have
been
much
to
his
honour
being
just
come
home
with
so
much
honour
from
sea
as
he
was
i
took
notice
of
the
sharp
letter
he
wrote
which
he
sent
us
to
read
to
sir
edward
spragg
where
he
is
very
plain
about
his
leaving
his
charge
of
the
ships
at
gravesend
when
the
enemy
came
last
up
and
several
other
things
a
copy
whereof
i
have
kept
but
it
is
done
like
a
most
worthy
man
and
he
says
it
is
good
now
and
then
to
tell
these
gentlemen
their
duty
for
they
need
it
and
it
seems
as
he
tells
me
all
our
knights
are
fallen
out
one
with
another
he
and
jenings
and
hollis
and
his
words
were
they
are
disputing
which
is
the
coward
among
them
and
yet
men
that
take
the
greatest
liberty
of
censuring
others
here
with
him
very
late
till
i
could
hardly
get
a
coach
or
link
willing
to
go
through
the
ruines
but
i
do
but
will
not
do
it
again
being
indeed
very
dangerous
sir
john
denham
poems
are
going
to
be
all
printed
together
and
among
others
some
new
things
and
among
them
he
showed
me
a
copy
of
verses
of
his
upon
sir
john
minnes
going
heretofore
to
bullogne
to
eat
a
pig
cowly
he
tells
me
is
dead
who
it
seems
was
a
mighty
civil
serious
man
which
i
did
not
know
before
to
the
wells
at
barnett
by
seven
and
there
found
many
people
but
the
morning
is
a
very
cold
morning
so
as
we
were
very
cold
all
the
way
in
the
coach
and
so
to
hatfield
to
the
inn
next
my
lord
salisbury
house
and
there
rested
ourselves
and
drank
and
bespoke
dinner
and
so
to
church
in
this
church
lies
the
former
lord
of
salisbury
cecil
buried
in
a
noble
tomb
then
we
to
our
inn
and
there
dined
very
well
and
mighty
merry
and
walked
out
into
the
park
through
the
fine
walk
of
trees
and
to
the
vineyard
and
there
showed
them
that
which
is
in
good
order
and
indeed
a
place
of
great
delight
which
together
with
our
fine
walk
through
the
park
was
of
as
much
pleasure
as
could
be
desired
in
the
world
for
country
pleasure
and
good
ayre
being
come
back
and
weary
with
the
walk
the
women
had
pleasure
in
putting
on
some
hats
which
are
much
worn
in
this
country
and
did
become
them
mightily
but
especially
my
wife
to
my
bookseller
and
did
buy
scott
discourse
of
witches
and
to
hear
cowly
mightily
lamented
his
death
by
ward
the
bishop
of
winchester
and
bates
who
were
standing
there
as
the
best
poet
of
our
nation
and
as
good
a
man
attended
the
duke
of
york
with
our
usual
business
who
upon
occasion
told
us
that
he
did
expect
this
night
or
to
hear
from
bredah
of
the
consummation
of
the
peace
sir
pen
and
i
to
the
duke
house
where
a
new
play
the
king
and
court
there
the
house
full
and
an
act
begun
and
so
we
went
to
the
king
and
there
saw
the
merry
wives
of
windsor
which
did
not
please
me
at
all
in
no
part
of
it
my
wife
and
i
to
the
duke
playhouse
where
we
saw
the
new
play
acted
yesterday
the
feign
innocence
or
sir
martin
marall
a
play
made
by
my
lord
duke
of
newcastle
but
as
every
body
says
corrected
by
dryden
it
is
the
most
entire
piece
of
mirth
a
complete
farce
from
one
end
to
the
other
that
certainly
was
ever
writ
i
never
laughed
so
in
all
my
life
and
at
very
good
wit
therein
not
fooling
the
house
full
and
in
all
things
of
mighty
content
to
me
every
body
wonders
that
we
have
no
news
from
bredah
of
the
ratification
of
the
peace
and
do
suspect
that
there
is
some
stop
in
it
to
the
king
playhouse
where
the
house
extraordinary
full
and
there
the
king
and
duke
of
york
to
see
the
new
play
queene
elizabeth
troubles
and
the
history
of
eighty
eight
i
confess
i
have
sucked
in
so
much
of
the
sad
story
of
queene
elizabeth
from
my
cradle
that
i
was
ready
to
weep
for
her
sometimes
but
the
play
is
the
most
ridiculous
that
sure
ever
came
upon
stage
and
indeed
is
merely
a
show
only
shows
the
true
garbe
of
the
queene
in
those
days
just
as
we
see
queene
mary
and
queene
elizabeth
painted
but
the
play
is
merely
a
puppet
play
acted
by
living
puppets
neither
the
design
nor
language
better
and
one
stands
by
and
tells
us
the
meaning
of
things
only
i
was
pleased
to
see
knipp
dance
among
the
milk
maids
and
to
hear
her
sing
a
song
to
queene
elizabeth
and
to
see
her
come
out
in
her
with
no
lockes
on
but
her
bare
face
and
hair
only
tied
up
in
a
knot
behind
which
is
the
comeliest
dress
that
ever
i
saw
her
in
to
her
advantage
to
cree
church
to
see
it
how
it
is
but
i
find
no
alteration
there
as
they
say
there
was
for
my
lord
mayor
and
aldermen
to
come
to
sermon
as
they
do
every
sunday
as
they
did
formerly
to
paul
sir
coventry
fell
to
discourse
of
retrenchments
and
therein
he
tells
how
he
would
have
but
only
one
clerk
of
the
acts
he
do
tell
me
he
hath
propounded
how
the
charge
of
the
navy
in
peace
shall
come
within
by
keeping
out
four
ships
in
summer
and
ten
in
the
winter
and
several
other
particulars
we
went
over
of
retrenchment
and
i
find
i
must
provide
some
things
to
offer
that
i
may
be
found
studious
to
lessen
the
king
charge
sir
coventry
did
single
sir
pen
and
me
and
desired
us
to
lend
the
king
some
money
out
of
the
prizes
we
have
taken
by
hogg
he
did
not
much
press
it
and
we
made
but
a
merry
answer
thereto
but
i
perceive
he
did
ask
it
seriously
and
did
tell
us
that
there
never
was
so
much
need
of
it
in
the
world
as
now
we
being
brought
to
the
lowest
straits
that
can
be
in
the
world
up
and
to
the
office
whence
lord
brouncker
minnes
and
pen
and
i
went
to
examine
some
men
that
are
put
in
there
for
rescuing
of
men
that
were
pressed
into
the
service
and
we
do
plainly
see
that
the
desperate
condition
that
we
put
men
into
for
want
of
their
pay
makes
them
mad
they
being
as
good
men
as
over
were
in
the
world
and
would
as
readily
serve
the
king
again
were
they
but
paid
two
men
leapt
overboard
among
others
into
the
thames
out
of
the
vessel
into
which
they
were
pressed
and
were
shot
by
the
soldiers
placed
there
to
keep
them
two
days
since
so
much
people
do
avoid
the
king
service
and
then
these
men
are
pressed
without
money
and
so
we
can
not
punish
them
for
any
thing
so
that
we
are
forced
only
to
make
a
show
of
severity
by
keeping
them
in
prison
but
are
unable
to
punish
them
shooting
the
men
was
rather
more
than
a
show
of
severity
returning
to
the
office
i
did
ask
whether
we
might
visit
commissioner
pett
to
which
i
confess
i
have
no
great
mind
and
it
was
answered
that
he
was
close
prisoner
and
we
could
not
but
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
would
send
for
him
to
his
lodgings
if
we
would
so
we
put
it
off
to
another
time
to
captain
cocke
to
dinner
where
lord
brouncker
and
his
lady
matt
wren
and
bulteale
and
sir
allan
apsly
the
last
of
whom
did
make
good
sport
he
being
already
fallen
under
the
retrenchments
of
the
new
committee
as
he
is
master
falconer
which
makes
him
mad
with
my
lord
brouncker
and
his
mistress
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
indian
emperour
a
by
dryden
where
i
find
nell
come
again
which
i
am
glad
of
but
was
most
infinitely
displeased
with
her
being
put
to
act
the
emperour
daughter
which
is
a
great
and
serious
part
which
she
does
most
basely
this
evening
pelling
comes
to
me
and
tells
me
that
this
night
the
dutch
letters
are
come
and
that
the
peace
was
proclaimed
there
the
inst
and
that
all
is
finished
which
for
my
life
i
know
not
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
for
a
peace
being
so
necessary
and
yet
so
bad
in
its
terms
to
white
hall
to
attend
the
council
the
king
there
and
it
was
about
considering
how
the
fleet
might
be
discharged
at
their
coming
in
shortly
the
peace
being
now
ratified
and
it
takes
place
on
monday
next
to
the
where
i
waited
talking
with
sir
downing
till
the
lords
met
he
tells
me
how
he
will
make
all
the
exchequer
officers
of
one
side
and
the
other
to
lend
the
king
money
upon
the
act
and
that
the
least
clerk
shall
lend
money
and
he
believes
the
least
will
but
this
i
do
not
believe
he
made
me
almost
ashamed
that
we
of
the
navy
had
not
in
all
this
time
lent
any
so
that
i
find
it
necessary
i
should
and
so
will
speedily
do
it
before
any
of
my
fellows
begin
and
lead
me
to
a
bigger
sum
by
and
by
the
lords
come
and
i
perceive
sir
coventry
is
the
man
and
nothing
done
till
he
comes
among
other
things
i
heard
him
observe
looking
over
a
paper
that
sir
john
shaw
is
a
miracle
of
a
man
for
he
thinks
he
executes
more
places
than
any
man
in
england
for
there
he
finds
him
a
surveyor
of
some
of
the
woods
and
so
reckoned
up
many
other
places
the
most
inconsistent
in
the
world
their
business
with
me
was
to
consider
how
to
assigne
such
of
our
commanders
as
will
take
assignements
upon
the
act
for
their
wages
and
the
consideration
thereof
was
referred
to
me
to
give
them
an
answer
the
next
sitting
which
is
a
horrid
poor
thing
but
they
scruple
at
nothing
of
honour
in
the
case
i
find
most
people
pleased
with
their
being
at
ease
and
safe
of
a
peace
that
they
may
know
no
more
charge
or
hazard
of
an
ill
managed
war
but
nobody
speaking
of
the
peace
with
any
content
or
pleasure
but
are
silent
in
it
as
of
a
thing
they
are
ashamed
of
no
not
at
court
much
less
in
the
city
bartholomew
day
this
morning
was
proclaimed
the
peace
between
us
and
the
states
of
the
united
provinces
and
also
of
the
king
of
france
and
denmarke
and
in
the
afternoon
the
proclamations
were
printed
and
came
out
and
at
night
the
bells
rung
but
no
bonfires
that
i
hear
of
any
where
partly
from
the
dearness
of
firing
but
principally
from
the
little
content
most
people
have
in
the
peace
this
day
comes
a
letter
from
the
duke
of
york
to
the
board
to
invite
us
which
is
as
much
as
to
fright
us
into
the
lending
the
king
money
which
is
a
poor
thing
and
most
dishonourable
and
shows
in
what
a
case
we
are
at
the
end
of
the
war
to
our
neighbours
and
the
king
do
now
declare
publickly
to
give
per
cent
to
all
lenders
which
make
some
think
that
the
dutch
themselves
will
send
over
money
and
lend
it
upon
our
publick
faith
the
act
of
parliament
to
the
office
where
we
sat
upon
a
particular
business
all
the
morning
and
my
lord
anglesy
with
us
who
and
my
lord
brouncker
do
bring
us
news
how
my
lord
chancellor
seal
is
to
be
taken
away
from
him
the
thing
is
so
great
and
sudden
to
me
that
it
put
me
into
a
very
great
admiration
what
should
be
the
meaning
of
it
and
they
do
not
own
that
they
know
what
it
should
be
but
this
is
certain
that
the
king
did
resolve
it
on
saturday
and
did
yesterday
send
the
duke
of
albemarle
the
only
man
fit
for
those
works
to
him
for
his
purse
to
which
the
chancellor
answered
that
he
received
it
from
the
king
and
would
deliver
it
to
the
king
own
hand
and
so
civilly
returned
the
duke
of
albemarle
without
it
and
this
morning
my
lord
chancellor
is
to
be
with
the
king
to
come
to
an
end
in
the
business
dined
at
sir
batten
where
boreman
was
who
came
from
white
hall
who
tells
us
that
he
saw
my
lord
chancellor
come
in
his
coach
with
some
of
his
men
without
his
seal
to
white
hall
to
his
chamber
and
thither
the
king
and
duke
of
york
came
and
staid
together
alone
an
hour
or
more
and
it
is
said
that
the
king
do
say
that
he
will
have
the
parliament
meet
and
that
it
will
prevent
much
trouble
by
having
of
him
out
of
their
enmity
by
his
place
being
taken
away
for
that
all
their
enmity
will
be
at
him
it
is
said
also
that
my
lord
chancellor
answers
that
he
desires
he
may
be
brought
to
his
trial
if
he
have
done
anything
to
lose
his
office
and
that
he
will
be
willing
and
is
most
desirous
to
lose
that
and
his
head
both
together
upon
what
terms
they
parted
nobody
knows
but
the
chancellor
looked
sad
he
says
then
in
comes
sir
richard
ford
and
says
he
hears
that
there
is
nobody
more
presses
to
reconcile
the
king
and
chancellor
than
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
duke
of
buckingham
the
latter
of
which
is
very
strange
not
only
that
he
who
was
so
lately
his
enemy
should
do
it
but
that
this
man
that
but
the
other
day
was
in
danger
of
losing
his
own
head
should
so
soon
come
to
be
a
mediator
for
others
it
shows
a
wise
government
they
all
say
that
he
is
but
a
poor
man
not
worth
above
in
land
but
this
i
can
not
believe
and
all
do
blame
him
for
having
built
so
great
a
house
till
he
had
got
a
better
estate
sir
pen
and
i
had
a
great
deal
of
discourse
with
mall
orange
moll
mentioned
before
who
tells
us
that
nell
is
already
left
by
lord
buckhurst
and
that
he
makes
sport
of
her
and
swears
she
hath
had
all
she
could
get
of
him
and
hart
the
celebrated
actor
her
great
admirer
now
hates
her
and
that
she
is
very
poor
and
hath
lost
my
lady
castlemaine
who
was
her
great
friend
also
but
she
is
come
to
the
playhouse
but
is
neglected
by
them
all
to
white
hall
and
there
hear
how
it
is
like
to
go
well
enough
with
my
lord
chancellor
that
he
is
like
to
keep
his
seal
desiring
that
he
may
stand
his
trial
in
parliament
if
they
will
accuse
him
of
any
thing
this
day
pierce
the
surgeon
was
with
me
and
tells
me
how
this
business
of
my
lord
was
certainly
designed
in
my
lady
castlemaine
chamber
and
that
when
he
went
from
the
king
on
monday
morning
she
was
in
bed
though
about
twelve
and
ran
out
in
her
smock
into
her
aviary
looking
into
white
hall
garden
and
thither
her
woman
brought
her
her
nightgown
and
stood
blessing
herself
at
the
old
man
going
away
and
several
of
the
gallants
of
white
hall
of
which
there
were
many
staying
to
see
the
chancellor
return
did
talk
to
her
in
her
among
others
blancford
telling
her
she
was
the
bird
of
passage
to
white
hall
till
past
twelve
in
a
crowd
of
people
in
the
lobby
expecting
the
hearing
of
the
great
cause
of
alderman
barker
against
my
lord
deputy
of
ireland
for
his
ill
usage
in
his
business
of
land
there
but
the
king
and
council
sat
so
long
as
they
neither
heard
them
nor
me
went
twice
round
bartholomew
fayre
which
i
was
glad
to
see
again
after
two
years
missing
it
by
the
plague
i
find
at
sir
carteret
that
they
do
mightily
joy
themselves
in
the
hopes
of
my
lord
chancellor
getting
over
this
trouble
and
i
make
them
believe
and
so
indeed
i
do
believe
he
will
that
my
lord
chancellor
is
become
popular
by
it
i
find
by
all
hands
that
the
court
is
at
this
day
all
to
pieces
every
man
of
a
faction
of
one
sort
or
other
so
as
it
is
to
be
feared
what
it
will
come
to
but
that
that
pleases
me
is
i
hear
that
brouncker
is
turned
away
yesterday
by
the
duke
of
york
for
some
bold
words
he
was
heard
by
colonel
werden
to
say
in
the
garden
the
day
the
chancellor
was
with
the
king
that
he
believed
the
king
would
be
hectored
out
of
every
thing
for
this
the
duke
of
york
who
all
say
hath
been
very
strong
for
his
at
this
trial
hath
turned
him
away
and
every
body
i
think
is
glad
of
it
for
he
was
a
pestilent
rogue
an
atheist
that
would
have
sold
his
king
and
country
for
almost
so
corrupt
and
wicked
a
rogue
he
is
by
all
men
report
but
one
observed
to
me
that
there
never
was
the
occasion
of
men
holding
their
tongues
at
court
and
every
where
else
as
there
is
at
this
day
for
nobody
knows
which
side
will
be
uppermost
at
white
hall
i
met
with
sir
downing
who
tells
me
of
sir
pen
offering
to
lend
and
i
tell
him
of
my
which
he
would
have
me
to
lend
upon
the
credit
of
the
latter
part
of
the
act
saying
that
by
that
means
my
per
cent
will
continue
to
me
the
longer
but
i
understand
better
and
will
do
it
upon
the
which
will
come
to
be
paid
the
sooner
there
being
no
delight
in
lending
money
now
to
be
paid
by
the
king
two
years
hence
but
here
he
and
sir
william
doyly
were
attending
the
council
as
commissioners
for
sick
and
wounded
and
prisoners
and
they
told
me
their
business
which
was
to
know
how
we
shall
do
to
release
our
prisoners
for
it
seems
the
dutch
have
got
us
to
agree
in
the
treaty
as
they
fool
us
in
any
thing
that
the
dyet
of
the
prisoners
on
both
sides
shall
be
paid
for
before
they
be
released
which
they
have
done
knowing
ours
to
run
high
they
having
more
prisoners
of
ours
than
we
have
of
theirs
so
they
are
able
and
most
ready
to
discharge
the
debt
of
theirs
but
we
are
neither
able
nor
willing
to
do
that
for
ours
the
debt
of
those
in
zeland
only
amounting
to
above
for
men
taken
in
the
king
own
ships
besides
others
taken
in
merchantmen
who
expect
as
is
usual
that
the
king
should
redeem
them
but
i
think
he
will
not
by
what
sir
downing
says
this
our
prisoners
complain
of
there
and
say
in
their
letters
which
sir
downing
showed
me
that
they
have
made
a
good
feat
that
they
should
be
taken
in
the
service
of
the
king
and
the
king
not
pay
for
their
victuals
while
prisoners
for
him
but
so
far
they
are
from
doing
thus
with
their
men
as
we
do
to
discourage
ours
that
i
find
in
the
letters
of
some
of
our
prisoners
there
which
he
showed
me
that
they
have
with
money
got
our
men
that
they
took
to
work
and
carry
their
ships
home
for
them
and
they
have
been
well
rewarded
and
released
when
they
come
into
holland
which
is
done
like
a
noble
brave
and
wise
people
i
to
bartholomew
fayre
to
walk
up
and
down
and
there
among
other
things
find
my
lady
castlemaine
at
a
patient
grizell
and
the
street
full
of
people
expecting
her
coming
out
i
confess
i
did
wonder
at
her
courage
to
come
abroad
thinking
the
people
would
abuse
her
but
they
silly
people
do
not
know
the
work
she
makes
and
therefore
suffered
her
with
great
respect
to
take
coach
and
she
away
without
any
trouble
at
all
captain
cocke
tells
me
that
there
is
yet
expectation
that
the
chancellor
will
lose
the
seal
and
assures
me
that
there
have
been
high
words
between
the
duke
of
york
and
sir
coventry
for
his
being
so
high
against
the
chancellor
so
as
the
duke
of
york
would
not
sign
some
papers
that
he
brought
saying
that
he
could
not
endure
the
sight
of
him
and
that
sir
coventry
answered
that
what
he
did
was
in
obedience
to
the
king
commands
and
that
he
did
not
think
any
man
fit
to
serve
a
prince
that
did
not
know
how
to
retire
and
live
a
country
life
at
the
office
all
the
morning
where
by
sir
pen
i
do
hear
that
the
seal
was
fetched
away
to
the
king
yesterday
from
the
lord
chancellor
by
secretary
morrice
which
puts
me
into
a
great
horror
in
the
evening
ball
of
the
tells
me
that
the
seal
is
delivered
to
sir
orlando
bridgeman
the
man
of
the
whole
nation
that
is
the
best
spoken
of
and
will
please
most
people
and
therefore
i
am
mighty
glad
of
it
he
was
then
at
my
lord
arlington
whither
i
went
expecting
to
see
him
come
out
but
staid
so
long
and
sir
coventry
coming
there
whom
i
had
not
a
mind
should
see
me
there
idle
upon
a
i
went
home
without
seeing
him
but
he
is
there
with
his
seal
in
his
hand
september
our
new
bridgeman
did
this
day
the
first
time
attend
the
king
to
chapel
with
his
seal
sir
cholmly
tells
me
there
are
hopes
that
the
women
also
will
have
a
rout
and
particularly
that
my
lady
castlemaine
is
coming
to
a
composition
with
the
king
to
be
gone
but
how
true
this
is
i
know
not
blancfort
is
made
to
the
duke
of
york
the
attorney
general
is
made
chief
justice
in
the
room
of
my
lord
bridgeman
the
is
made
and
sir
edward
turner
made
according
to
beatson
no
change
took
place
in
these
officers
at
this
time
it
is
pretty
to
see
how
strange
every
body
looks
nobody
knowing
whence
this
arises
whether
from
my
lady
castlemaine
bab
may
and
their
faction
or
from
the
duke
of
york
notwithstanding
his
great
appearing
of
defence
of
the
chancellor
or
from
sir
william
coventry
and
some
few
with
him
but
greater
changes
are
yet
expected
this
day
is
kept
in
the
city
as
a
publick
fast
for
the
fire
this
day
twelve
months
but
i
was
not
at
church
being
commanded
with
the
rest
to
attend
the
duke
of
york
and
therefore
with
sir
minnes
to
james
where
we
had
much
business
before
the
duke
of
york
and
observed
all
things
to
be
very
kind
between
the
duke
of
york
and
sir
coventry
which
did
mightily
joy
me
when
we
had
done
sir
coventry
called
me
down
with
him
to
his
chamber
and
there
told
me
that
he
is
leaving
the
duke
of
service
which
i
was
amazed
at
but
he
tells
me
that
it
is
not
with
the
least
unkindness
on
the
duke
of
york
side
though
he
expects
and
i
told
him
he
was
in
the
right
it
will
be
interpreted
otherwise
because
done
just
at
this
time
but
says
he
i
did
desire
it
a
good
while
since
and
the
duke
of
york
did
with
much
entreaty
grant
it
desiring
that
i
would
say
nothing
of
it
that
he
might
have
time
and
liberty
to
choose
his
successor
without
being
importuned
for
others
whom
he
should
not
like
and
that
he
hath
chosen
wren
which
i
am
glad
of
he
being
a
very
ingenious
man
and
so
sir
coventry
says
of
him
though
he
knows
him
little
but
particularly
commends
him
for
the
book
he
writ
in
answer
to
harrington
oceana
which
for
that
reason
i
intend
to
buy
he
tells
me
the
true
reason
is
that
he
being
a
man
not
willing
to
undertake
more
business
than
he
can
go
through
and
being
desirous
to
have
his
whole
time
to
spend
upon
the
business
of
the
treasury
and
a
little
for
his
own
ease
he
did
desire
this
of
the
duke
of
york
he
assures
me
that
the
kindness
with
which
he
goes
away
from
the
duke
of
york
is
one
of
the
greatest
joys
that
ever
he
had
in
the
world
i
used
some
freedom
with
him
telling
him
how
the
world
hath
discoursed
of
his
having
offended
the
duke
of
york
about
the
late
business
of
the
chancellor
he
does
not
deny
it
but
says
that
perhaps
the
duke
of
york
might
have
some
reason
for
it
he
opposing
him
in
a
thing
wherein
he
was
so
earnest
but
tells
me
that
notwithstanding
all
that
the
duke
of
york
does
not
now
nor
can
blame
him
for
he
was
the
man
that
did
propose
the
removal
of
the
chancellor
and
that
he
did
still
persist
in
it
and
at
this
day
publickly
owns
it
and
is
glad
of
it
but
that
the
duke
of
york
knows
that
he
did
first
speak
of
it
to
the
duke
of
york
before
he
spoke
to
any
mortal
creature
besides
which
was
fair
dealing
and
the
duke
of
york
was
then
of
the
same
mind
with
him
and
did
speak
of
it
to
the
king
though
since
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
he
afterwards
altered
i
did
then
desire
to
know
what
was
the
great
matter
that
grounded
his
desire
of
the
removal
he
told
me
many
things
not
fit
to
be
spoken
and
yet
not
any
thing
of
his
being
unfaithful
to
the
king
but
instar
omnium
he
told
me
that
while
he
was
so
great
at
the
board
and
in
the
administration
of
matters
there
was
no
room
for
any
body
to
propose
any
remedy
to
what
was
amiss
or
to
compass
any
thing
though
never
so
good
for
the
kingdom
unless
approved
of
by
the
chancellor
he
managing
all
things
with
that
greatness
which
now
will
be
removed
that
the
king
may
have
the
benefit
of
others
advice
i
then
told
him
that
the
world
hath
an
opinion
that
he
hath
joined
himself
with
my
lady
faction
but
in
this
business
he
told
me
he
can
not
help
it
but
says
they
are
in
an
errour
for
he
will
never
while
he
lives
truckle
under
any
body
or
any
faction
but
do
just
as
his
own
reason
and
judgment
directs
and
when
he
can
not
use
that
freedom
he
will
have
nothing
to
do
in
public
affairs
but
then
he
added
that
he
never
was
the
man
that
ever
had
any
discourse
with
my
lady
castlemaine
or
with
others
from
her
about
this
or
any
public
business
or
ever
made
her
a
visit
or
at
least
not
this
or
been
in
her
lodgings
but
when
called
on
any
business
to
attend
the
king
there
nor
hath
had
any
thing
to
do
in
knowing
her
mind
in
this
business
he
ended
all
with
telling
me
that
he
knows
that
he
that
serves
a
prince
must
expect
and
be
contented
to
stand
all
fortunes
and
be
provided
to
retreat
and
that
he
is
most
willing
to
do
whatever
the
king
shall
please
and
so
we
parted
he
setting
me
down
out
of
his
coach
at
charing
cross
and
desired
me
to
tell
sir
pen
what
he
had
told
me
of
his
leaving
the
duke
of
york
service
that
his
friends
might
not
be
the
last
that
know
it
i
took
a
coach
and
went
homewards
but
then
turned
again
and
to
white
hall
where
i
met
with
many
people
and
among
other
things
do
learn
that
there
is
some
fear
that
brouncker
is
got
into
the
king
favour
and
will
be
cherished
there
which
will
breed
ill
will
between
the
king
and
duke
of
york
he
lodging
at
this
time
in
white
hall
since
he
was
put
away
from
the
duke
of
york
and
he
is
great
with
bab
may
my
lady
castlemaine
and
that
wicked
crew
but
i
find
this
denied
by
sir
carteret
who
tells
me
that
he
is
sure
he
hath
no
kindness
from
the
king
that
the
king
at
first
indeed
did
endeavour
to
persuade
the
duke
of
york
from
putting
him
away
but
when
besides
this
business
of
his
ill
words
concerning
his
majesty
in
the
business
of
the
chancellor
he
told
him
that
he
hath
had
a
long
time
a
mind
to
put
him
away
for
his
ill
offices
done
between
him
and
his
wife
the
king
held
his
peace
and
said
no
more
but
wished
him
to
do
what
he
pleased
with
him
which
was
very
noble
i
met
with
fenn
and
he
tells
me
as
i
do
hear
from
some
others
that
the
business
of
the
chancellor
had
proceeded
from
something
of
a
mistake
for
the
duke
of
york
did
first
tell
the
king
that
the
chancellor
had
a
desire
to
be
eased
of
his
great
trouble
and
that
the
king
when
the
chancellor
came
to
him
did
wonder
to
hear
him
deny
it
and
the
duke
of
york
was
forced
to
deny
to
the
king
that
ever
he
did
tell
him
so
in
those
terms
but
the
king
did
answer
that
he
was
sure
that
he
did
say
some
such
things
to
him
but
however
since
it
had
gone
so
far
did
desire
him
to
be
contented
with
it
as
a
thing
very
convenient
for
him
as
well
as
for
himself
the
king
and
so
matters
proceeded
as
we
find
now
it
is
likely
the
chancellor
might
some
time
or
other
in
a
compliment
or
vanity
say
to
the
duke
of
york
that
he
was
weary
of
this
burden
and
i
know
not
what
and
this
comes
of
it
some
people
and
myself
among
them
are
of
good
hope
from
this
change
that
things
are
reforming
but
there
are
others
that
do
think
it
is
a
bit
of
chance
as
all
other
our
greatest
matters
are
and
that
there
is
no
general
plot
or
contrivance
in
any
number
of
people
what
to
do
next
though
i
believe
sir
coventry
may
in
himself
have
further
designs
and
so
that
though
other
changes
may
come
yet
they
shall
be
accidental
and
laid
upon
good
principles
of
doing
good
may
showed
me
the
king
new
buildings
in
order
to
their
having
of
some
old
sails
for
the
closing
of
the
windows
this
winter
i
dined
with
sir
carteret
with
whom
dined
jack
ashburnham
and
creeton
who
i
observe
to
be
a
most
good
man
and
scholar
in
discourse
at
dinner
concerning
the
change
of
men
humours
and
fashions
touching
meats
asburnham
told
us
that
he
remembers
since
the
only
fruit
in
request
and
eaten
by
the
king
and
queene
at
table
as
the
best
fruit
was
the
katharine
payre
though
they
knew
at
the
time
other
fruits
of
france
and
our
own
country
after
dinner
comes
in
townsend
and
there
i
was
witness
of
a
horrid
rateing
which
ashburnham
as
one
of
the
grooms
of
the
king
bedchamber
did
give
him
for
want
of
linen
for
the
person
which
he
swore
was
not
to
be
endured
and
that
the
king
would
not
endure
it
and
that
the
king
his
father
would
have
hanged
his
should
he
have
been
served
so
the
king
having
at
this
day
no
hankerchers
and
but
three
bands
to
his
neck
he
swore
townsend
pleaded
want
of
money
and
the
owing
of
the
linendraper
and
that
he
hath
of
late
got
many
rich
things
made
beds
and
sheets
and
saddles
without
money
and
that
he
can
go
no
further
but
still
this
old
man
indeed
like
an
old
loving
servant
did
cry
out
for
the
king
person
to
be
neglected
but
when
he
was
gone
townsend
told
me
that
it
is
the
grooms
taking
away
the
king
linen
at
the
quarter
end
as
their
fees
which
makes
this
great
want
for
whether
the
king
can
get
it
or
no
they
will
run
away
at
the
quarter
end
with
what
he
hath
had
let
the
king
get
more
as
he
can
all
the
company
gone
sir
carteret
and
i
to
talk
and
it
is
pretty
to
observe
how
already
he
says
that
he
did
always
look
upon
the
chancellor
indeed
as
his
friend
though
he
never
did
do
him
any
service
at
all
nor
ever
got
any
thing
by
nor
was
a
man
apt
and
that
i
think
is
true
to
do
any
man
any
kindness
of
his
own
nature
though
i
do
know
he
was
believed
by
all
the
world
to
be
the
greatest
support
of
sir
carteret
with
the
king
of
any
man
in
england
but
so
little
is
now
made
of
it
he
observes
that
my
lord
sandwich
will
lose
a
great
friend
in
him
and
i
think
so
too
my
lord
hinchingbroke
being
about
a
match
calculated
purely
out
of
respect
to
my
lord
chancellor
family
by
and
by
sir
carteret
and
townsend
and
i
to
consider
of
an
answer
to
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
about
my
lord
sandwich
profits
in
the
wardrobe
which
seem
as
we
make
them
to
be
very
small
not
but
only
the
difference
in
measure
at
which
he
buys
and
delivers
out
to
the
king
and
then
in
the
pound
from
the
tradesman
for
what
money
he
receives
for
him
but
this
it
is
believed
these
commissioners
will
endeavour
to
take
away
from
him
i
went
to
see
a
great
match
at
tennis
between
prince
rupert
and
one
captain
cooke
against
bab
may
and
the
elder
chichly
where
the
king
was
and
court
and
it
seems
they
are
the
best
players
at
tennis
in
the
nation
but
this
puts
me
in
mind
of
what
i
observed
in
the
morning
that
the
king
playing
at
tennis
had
a
carried
to
him
and
i
was
told
it
was
to
weigh
him
after
he
had
done
playing
and
at
noon
ashburnham
told
me
that
it
is
only
the
king
curiosity
which
he
usually
hath
of
weighing
himself
before
and
after
his
play
to
see
how
much
he
loses
in
weight
by
playing
and
this
day
he
lost
i
to
sir
batten
and
sir
pen
and
there
discoursed
of
sir
coventry
leaving
the
duke
of
york
and
wren
succeeding
him
they
told
me
both
seriously
that
they
had
long
cut
me
out
for
secretary
to
the
duke
of
york
if
ever
sir
coventry
left
him
which
agreeing
with
what
i
have
heard
from
other
hands
heretofore
do
make
me
not
only
think
that
something
of
that
kind
hath
been
thought
on
but
do
comfort
me
to
see
that
the
world
hath
such
an
esteem
of
my
qualities
as
to
think
me
fit
for
any
such
thing
though
i
am
glad
with
all
my
heart
that
i
am
not
so
for
it
would
never
please
me
to
be
forced
to
the
attendance
that
that
would
require
and
leave
my
wife
and
family
to
themselves
as
i
must
do
in
such
a
case
thinking
myself
now
in
the
best
place
that
ever
man
was
in
to
please
his
own
mind
in
and
therefore
i
will
take
to
preserve
it
attended
the
duke
of
york
about
the
list
of
ships
that
we
propose
to
sell
and
here
there
attended
wren
the
first
time
who
hath
not
yet
i
think
received
the
duke
of
york
seal
and
papers
at
our
coming
hither
we
found
the
duke
and
duchesse
all
alone
at
dinner
methought
melancholy
or
else
i
thought
so
from
the
late
occasion
of
the
chancellor
fall
who
they
say
however
takes
it
very
contentedly
by
coach
to
white
hall
to
the
and
there
met
with
sir
coventry
going
in
who
took
me
aside
and
told
me
that
he
was
just
come
from
delivering
up
his
seal
and
papers
to
wren
and
told
me
he
must
now
take
his
leave
of
me
as
a
naval
man
but
that
he
shall
always
bear
respect
to
his
friends
there
the
officers
of
the
navy
and
particularly
to
myself
with
great
kindness
which
i
returned
to
him
with
thanks
and
so
with
much
kindness
parted
and
he
into
the
council
staid
and
heard
alderman
barker
case
of
his
being
abused
by
the
council
of
ireland
touching
his
lands
there
all
i
observed
there
is
the
silliness
of
the
king
playing
with
his
dog
all
the
while
and
not
minding
the
business
and
what
he
said
was
mighty
weak
but
my
lord
keeper
i
observed
to
be
a
mighty
able
man
to
the
duke
of
york
playhouse
and
there
saw
mustapha
which
the
more
i
see
the
more
i
like
and
is
a
most
admirable
poem
and
bravely
acted
only
both
betterton
and
harris
could
not
contain
from
laughing
in
the
midst
of
a
most
serious
part
from
the
ridiculous
mistake
of
one
of
the
men
upon
the
stage
which
i
did
not
like
this
morning
was
told
by
sir
batten
that
he
do
hear
from
grey
who
hath
good
intelligence
that
our
queene
is
to
go
into
a
nunnery
there
to
spend
her
days
and
that
my
lady
castlemaine
is
going
to
france
and
is
to
have
a
pension
of
this
latter
i
do
more
believe
than
the
other
it
being
very
wise
in
her
to
do
it
and
save
all
she
hath
besides
easing
the
king
and
kingdom
of
a
burden
and
reproach
lord
brouncker
says
he
do
believe
that
my
lady
castlemaine
is
compounding
with
the
king
for
a
pension
and
to
leave
the
court
but
that
her
demands
are
mighty
high
but
he
believes
the
king
is
resolved
and
so
do
everybody
else
i
speak
with
to
do
all
possible
to
please
the
parliament
and
he
do
declare
that
he
will
deliver
every
body
up
to
give
an
account
of
their
actions
and
that
last
friday
it
seems
there
was
an
act
of
council
passed
to
put
out
all
papists
in
office
and
to
keep
out
any
from
coming
in
sir
downing
told
he
had
been
seven
years
finding
out
a
man
that
could
dress
english
as
it
should
be
and
indeed
it
is
now
as
good
in
all
respects
as
kidd
and
he
says
will
save
that
goes
out
to
france
for
he
tells
me
that
at
this
day
the
king
in
familiar
talk
do
call
the
chancellor
the
insolent
man
and
says
that
he
would
not
let
him
speak
himself
in
council
which
is
very
high
and
do
show
that
the
chancellor
is
like
to
be
in
a
bad
state
unless
he
can
defend
himself
better
than
people
think
and
yet
creed
tells
me
that
he
do
hear
that
my
lord
cornbury
henry
afterwards
second
earl
of
clarendon
do
say
that
his
father
do
long
for
the
coming
of
the
parliament
in
order
to
his
own
vindication
more
than
any
one
of
his
enemies
and
here
it
comes
into
my
head
to
set
down
what
rawlinson
whom
i
met
in
on
friday
last
looking
over
his
ruines
there
told
me
that
he
was
told
by
one
of
my
lord
chancellor
gentlemen
lately
that
a
grant
coming
to
him
to
be
sealed
wherein
the
king
hath
given
my
lady
castlemaine
or
somebody
by
her
means
a
place
which
he
did
not
like
well
of
he
did
stop
the
grant
saying
that
he
thought
this
woman
would
sell
every
thing
shortly
which
she
hearing
of
she
sent
to
let
him
know
that
she
had
disposed
of
this
place
and
did
not
doubt
in
a
little
time
to
dispose
of
his
to
white
hall
and
saw
the
king
and
queene
at
dinner
and
observed
which
i
never
did
before
the
formality
but
it
is
but
a
formality
of
putting
a
bit
of
bread
wiped
upon
each
dish
into
the
mouth
of
every
man
that
brings
a
dish
but
it
should
be
in
the
sauce
here
were
some
russes
come
to
see
the
king
at
dinner
among
others
the
interpreter
a
comely
englishman
in
the
own
clothes
which
the
envoy
it
seems
in
vanity
did
send
to
show
his
fine
clothes
upon
this
man
back
he
being
one
it
seems
of
a
comelier
presence
than
himself
and
yet
it
is
said
that
none
of
their
clothes
are
their
own
but
taken
out
of
the
king
own
wardrobe
and
which
they
dare
not
bring
back
dirty
or
spotted
but
clean
or
are
in
danger
of
being
beaten
as
they
say
inasmuch
that
sir
charles
cotterell
knight
and
master
of
the
ceremonies
from
to
when
he
resigned
in
favour
of
his
son
says
when
they
are
to
have
an
audience
they
never
venture
to
put
on
their
clothes
till
he
appears
to
come
and
fetch
them
and
as
soon
as
ever
they
come
home
put
them
off
again
i
to
sir
carteret
to
dinner
where
cofferer
ashburnham
who
told
a
good
story
of
a
prisoner
being
condemned
at
salisbury
for
a
small
matter
while
he
was
on
the
bench
with
his
judge
richardson
sir
thomas
richardson
knight
appointed
chief
justice
of
the
common
pleas
and
while
they
were
considering
to
transport
him
to
save
his
life
the
fellow
flung
a
great
stone
at
the
judge
that
missed
him
but
broke
through
the
wainscoat
upon
this
he
had
his
hand
cut
off
and
was
hanged
presently
this
anecdote
is
thus
confirmed
in
chief
justice

here
do
hear
by
tom
killigrew
and
progers
that
for
certain
news
is
come
of
harman
having
spoiled
nineteen
of
french
ships
somewhere
about
the
barbadoes
i
think
they
said
but
wherever
it
is
it
is
a
good
service
and
very
welcome
to
the
where
now
the
yard
was
full
of
people
and
those
most
of
them
seamen
striving
by
force
to
get
in
i
got
into
the
common
pit
and
there
with
my
cloak
about
my
face
i
stood
and
saw
the
prize
fought
till
one
of
them
a
shoemaker
was
so
cut
in
both
his
wrists
that
he
could
not
fight
any
longer
and
then
they
broke
off
his
enemy
was
a
butcher
the
sport
very
good
and
various
humours
to
be
seen
among
the
rabble
that
is
there
to
james
where
we
all
met
and
did
our
usual
weekly
business
with
the
duke
of
york
but
lord
methinks
both
he
and
we
are
mighty
flat
and
dull
to
what
we
used
to
be
when
sir
coventry
was
among
us
met
povy
and
he
and
i
to
walk
an
hour
or
more
in
the
pell
mell
talking
of
the
times
he
tells
me
among
other
things
that
this
business
of
the
chancellor
do
breed
a
kind
of
inward
distance
between
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
and
that
it
can
not
be
avoided
for
though
the
latter
did
at
first
move
it
through
his
folly
yet
he
is
made
to
see
that
he
is
wounded
by
it
and
is
become
much
a
less
man
than
be
was
and
so
will
be
but
he
tells
me
that
they
are
and
have
always
been
great
dissemblers
one
towards
another
and
that
their
parting
heretofore
in
france
is
never
to
be
thoroughly
reconciled
between
them
he
tells
me
that
he
believes
there
is
no
such
thing
likely
to
be
as
a
composition
with
my
lady
castlemaine
and
that
she
shall
be
got
out
of
the
way
before
the
parliament
comes
for
he
says
she
is
high
as
ever
she
was
though
he
believes
the
king
is
as
weary
of
her
as
is
possible
and
would
give
any
thing
to
remove
her
but
he
is
so
weak
in
his
passion
that
he
dare
not
do
it
that
he
do
believe
that
my
lord
chancellor
will
be
doing
some
acts
in
the
parliament
which
shall
render
him
popular
and
that
there
are
many
people
now
do
speak
kindly
of
him
that
did
not
before
but
that
if
he
do
do
this
it
must
provoke
the
king
and
that
party
that
removed
him
he
seems
to
doubt
what
the
king
of
france
will
do
in
case
an
accommodation
shall
be
made
between
spain
and
him
for
flanders
for
then
he
will
have
nothing
more
easy
to
do
with
his
army
than
to
subdue
us
come
to
dine
with
me
sir
batten
and
his
lady
and
griffith
their
ward
and
sir
pen
and
his
lady
and
lowther
who
is
grown
either
through
pride
or
want
of
manners
a
fool
having
not
a
word
to
say
and
as
a
further
mark
of
a
beggarly
proud
fool
hath
a
bracelet
of
diamonds
and
rubies
about
her
wrist
and
a
sixpenny
necklace
about
her
neck
and
not
one
good
rag
of
clothes
upon
her
back
and
sir
john
chichly
in
their
company
and
turner
here
i
had
an
extraordinary
good
and
handsome
dinner
for
them
better
than
any
of
them
deserve
or
understand
saving
sir
john
chichly
and
mrs
turner
to
the
duke
of
york
playhouse
and
there
saw
part
of
the
ungrateful
lovers
and
sat
by
beck
marshall
whose
hand
is
very
handsome
here
came
moore
and
sat
and
discoursed
with
me
of
public
matters
the
sum
of
which
is
that
he
do
doubt
that
there
is
more
at
the
bottom
than
the
removal
of
the
chancellor
that
is
he
do
verily
believe
that
the
king
do
resolve
to
declare
the
duke
of
monmouth
legitimate
and
that
we
shall
soon
see
if
this
i
do
not
think
the
duke
of
york
will
endure
without
blows
but
his
poverty
and
being
lessened
by
having
the
chancellor
fallen
and
sir
coventry
gone
from
him
will
disable
him
from
being
able
to
do
any
thing
almost
he
being
himself
almost
lost
in
the
esteem
of
people
and
will
be
more
and
more
unless
my
lord
chancellor
who
is
already
begun
to
be
pitied
by
some
people
and
to
be
better
thought
of
than
was
expected
do
recover
himself
in
parliament
he
do
say
that
that
is
very
true
that
my
lord
chancellor
did
lately
make
some
stop
of
some
grants
of
to
my
lord
grandison
george
villiers
fourth
viscount
grandison
and
younger
brother
of
lady
castlemaine
father
who
had
died
without
male
issue
which
was
only
in
his
name
for
the
use
of
my
lady
castlemaine
children
and
that
this
did
incense
her
and
she
did
speak
very
scornful
words
and
sent
a
scornful
message
to
him
about
it
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
the
whole
court
is
mighty
joyful
at
the
duchesse
of
york
being
brought
to
bed
this
day
or
yesterday
of
a
son
which
will
settle
men
minds
mightily
and
pierce
tells
me
that
he
do
think
that
what
the
king
do
of
giving
the
duke
of
monmouth
the
command
of
his
guards
and
giving
my
lord
gerard
for
it
is
merely
to
find
an
employment
for
him
upon
which
he
may
live
and
not
out
of
any
design
to
bring
him
into
any
title
to
the
crowne
which
moore
did
the
other
day
put
me
into
great
fear
of
to
the
king
playhouse
to
see
the
northerne
castle
which
i
think
i
never
did
see
before
knipp
acted
is
it
and
did
her
part
very
extraordinary
well
but
the
play
is
but
a
mean
sorry
play
sir
cholmly
was
with
me
a
good
while
who
tells
me
that
the
duke
of
york
child
is
christened
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
the
marquis
of
worcester

second

and
they
have
named
it
edgar
which
is
a
brave
name
but
it
seems
they
are
more
joyful
in
the
chancellor
family
at
the
birth
of
this
prince
than
in
wisdom
they
should
for
fear
it
should
give
the
king
cause
of
jealousy
sir
cholmly
thinks
there
may
possibly
be
some
persons
that
would
be
glad
to
have
the
queene
removed
to
some
monastery
or
somewhere
or
other
to
make
room
for
a
new
wife
for
they
will
all
be
unsafe
under
the
duke
of
york
he
says
the
king
and
parliament
will
agree
that
is
that
the
king
will
do
any
thing
that
they
will
have
him
i
met
with
a
fourth
advice
to
the
painter
upon
the
coming
in
of
the
dutch
to
the
river
and
end
of
the
war
in
the
collection
of
poems
on
affairs
of
state
there
are
four
pieces
called
directions
to
a
painter
the
first
of
them
concerning
the
dutch
war
by
sir
john
denham
the
same
book
also
contains
the
last
instructions
to
a
painter
about
the
dutch
wars
by
andrew
marvel
which
from
its
severity
i
suppose
to
be
the
work
here
alluded
to
that
made
my
heart
ake
to
read
it
being
too
sharp
and
so
true
here
i
also
saw
a
printed
account
of
the
examinations
taken
touching
the
burning
of
the
city
of
london
showing
the
plot
of
the
papists
therein
which
it
seems
hath
been
ordered
to
be
burnt
by
the
hands
of
the
common
hangman
in
westminster
palace
my
wife
and
mercer
and
i
away
to
the
playhouse
to
see
the
scornfull
lady
but
it
being
now
three
there
was
not
one
soul
in
the
pit
whereupon
for
shame
we
could
not
go
in
but
against
our
wills
went
all
to
see
tu
quoque
again
where
there
was
pretty
store
of
company
here
we
saw
madam
morland
sir
samuel
morland
first
wife
who
is
grown
mighty
fat
but
is
very
comely
thence
to
the
house
upon
a
wager
of
mine
with
my
wife
that
there
would
be
no
acting
there
there
being
no
company
so
i
went
in
and
found
a
pretty
good
company
there
and
saw
their
dance
at
the
end
of
the
play
i
walked
in
the
exchange
which
is
now
made
mighty
pretty
by
having
windows
and
doors
before
all
their
shops
to
keep
out
the
cold
by
coach
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
mad
couple
probably
a
mad
couple
well
matched
a
comedy
by
richard
brome
printed
in
my
wife
having
been
at
the
same
play
with
jane
in
the
seat
the
king
duke
of
york
and
the
men
of
the
court
have
been
these
four
or
five
days
at
bagshot
at
noon
comes
sheres
whom
i
find
a
good
ingenious
man
but
do
talk
a
little
too
much
of
his
travels
he
left
my
lord
sandwich
well
but
in
pain
to
be
at
home
for
want
of
money
which
comes
very
hardly
i
have
indulged
myself
more
in
pleasure
for
these
last
two
months
than
ever
i
did
in
my
life
before
since
i
came
to
be
a
person
concerned
in
business
and
i
doubt
when
i
come
to
make
up
my
accounts
i
shall
find
it
so
by
the
expence
at
my
lord
ashly
by
invitation
to
dine
there
at
table
it
is
worth
remembering
that
my
lord
tells
us
that
the
house
of
lords
is
the
last
appeal
that
a
man
can
make
upon
a
point
of
interpretation
of
the
law
and
that
therein
they
are
above
the
judges
and
that
he
did
assert
this
in
the
lords
house
upon
the
late
occasion
of
the
quarrel
between
my
lord
bristoll
and
the
chancellor
when
the
former
did
accuse
the
latter
of
treason
and
the
judges
did
bring
it
in
not
to
be
treason
my
lord
ashly
did
declare
that
the
judgement
of
the
judges
was
nothing
in
the
presence
of
their
lordships
but
only
as
far
as
they
were
the
properest
men
to
bring
precedents
but
not
to
interpret
the
law
to
their
lordships
but
only
the
inducements
of
their
persuasions
and
this
the
lords
did
concur
in
another
pretty
thing
was
my
lady
ashly
speaking
of
the
bad
qualities
of
coaches
among
others
the
flying
open
of
the
doors
upon
any
great
shake
but
another
was
that
my
lady
peterborough
being
in
her
with
the
glass
up
and
seeing
a
lady
pass
by
in
a
coach
whom
she
would
salute
the
glass
was
so
clear
that
she
thought
it
had
been
open
and
so
ran
her
head
through
the
glass
we
were
put
into
my
lord
room
before
he
could
come
to
us
and
there
had
opportunity
to
look
over
his
state
of
his
accounts
of
the
prizes
and
there
saw
how
bountiful
the
king
hath
been
to
several
people
and
hardly
any
man
almost
commander
of
the
navy
of
any
note
but
hath
had
some
reward
or
other
out
of
them
and
many
sums
to
the
but
not
so
many
i
see
as
i
thought
there
had
been
but
we
could
not
look
quite
through
it
but
several
and
people
about
the
court
had
good
sums
and
among
others
sir
john
minnes
and
lord
brouncker
have
for
looking
to
the
east
india
prizes
while
i
did
their
work
for
them
by
and
by
my
lord
came
and
we
did
look
over
yeabsly
business
a
little
and
i
find
how
prettily
this
cunning
lord
can
be
partial
and
dissemble
it
in
this
case
being
privy
to
the
bribe
he
is
to
receive
with
sir
cholmly
to
westminster
who
by
the
way
told
me
how
merry
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
court
were
the
other
day
when
they
were
abroad
hunting
they
came
to
sir
carteret
house
at
cranbourne
and
there
were
entertained
and
all
made
drunk
and
being
all
drunk
armerer
did
come
to
the
king
and
swore
to
him
by
god
sir
says
he
you
are
not
so
kind
to
the
duke
of
york
of
late
as
you
used
to
be
not
i
says
the
king
why
so
why
says
he
if
you
are
let
us
drink
his
health
why
let
us
says
the
king
then
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
drank
it
and
having
done
the
king
began
to
drink
it
nay
sir
says
armerer
by
god
you
must
do
it
on
your
knees
so
he
did
and
then
all
the
company
and
having
done
it
all
fell
for
joy
being
all
maudlin
and
kissing
one
another
the
king
the
duke
of
york
and
the
duke
of
york
the
king
and
in
such
a
maudlin
pickle
as
never
people
were
and
so
passed
the
day
but
sir
cholmly
tells
me
that
the
king
hath
this
good
luck
that
the
next
day
he
hates
to
have
any
body
mention
what
he
had
done
the
day
before
nor
will
suffer
any
body
to
gain
upon
him
that
way
which
is
a
good
quality
by
and
by
comes
captain
cocke
about
business
who
tells
me
that
brouncker
is
lost
for
ever
notwithstanding
that
my
lord
brouncker
hath
advised
with
him
cocke
how
he
might
make
a
peace
with
the
duke
of
york
and
chancellor
upon
promise
of
serving
him
in
the
parliament
but
cocke
says
that
is
base
to
offer
and
will
have
no
success
there
he
says
that
wren
hath
refused
a
present
of
tom
wilson
for
his
place
of
keeper
at
chatham
and
is
resolved
never
to
take
any
thing
which
is
both
wise
in
him
and
good
to
the
king
service
with
sir
cholmly
who
came
to
me
about
his
business
to
white
hall
and
thither
came
also
my
lord
brouncker
and
we
by
and
by
called
in
and
our
paper
read
and
much
discourse
thereon
by
sir
carteret
my
lord
anglesy
sir
coventry
and
my
lord
ashly
and
myself
but
i
could
easily
discern
that
they
none
of
them
understood
the
business
and
the
king
at
last
ended
it
with
saying
lazily
why
says
he
after
all
this
discourse
i
now
come
to
understand
it
and
that
is
that
there
can
nothing
be
done
in
this
more
than
is
possible
which
was
so
silly
as
i
never
heard
and
therefore
says
he
i
would
have
these
gentlemen
do
as
much
as
possible
to
hasten
the
accounts
and
that
is
all
and
so
we
broke
up
and
i
confess
i
went
away
ashamed
to
see
how
slightly
things
are
advised
upon
there
here
i
saw
the
duke
of
buckingham
sit
in
council
again
where
he
was
it
seems
the
last
and
it
is
wonderful
to
see
how
this
man
is
come
again
to
his
places
all
of
them
after
the
reproach
and
disgrace
done
him
so
that
things
are
done
in
a
most
foolish
manner
quite
through
the
duke
of
buckingham
did
second
sir
coventry
in
the
advising
the
king
that
he
would
not
concern
himself
in
the
evening
or
not
evening
any
man
accounts
or
any
thing
else
wherein
he
had
not
the
same
satisfaction
that
would
satisfy
the
parliament
saying
that
nothing
would
displease
the
parliament
more
than
to
find
him
defending
any
thing
that
is
not
right
nor
justifiable
to
the
utmost
degree
but
methought
he
spoke
it
but
very
poorly
after
this
i
walked
up
and
down
the
gallery
till
noon
and
here
i
met
with
bishop
fuller
who
to
my
great
joy
is
made
which
i
did
not
hear
before
bishop
of
lincolne
at
noon
i
took
coach
and
to
sir
carteret
in
to
the
house
that
is
my
lord
which
my
lord
lets
him
have
and
this
is
the
first
day
of
dining
there
and
there
dined
with
him
and
his
lady
my
lord
john
lord
roberts
afterwards
earl
of
radnor
filled
this
office
from
to
who
is
indeed
a
very
sober
man
who
among
other
talk
did
mightily
wonder
at
the
reason
of
the
growth
of
the
credit
of
bankers
since
it
is
so
ordinary
a
thing
for
citizens
to
break
out
of
knavery
upon
this
we
had
much
discourse
and
i
observed
therein
to
the
honour
of
this
city
that
i
have
not
heard
of
one
citizen
of
london
broke
in
all
this
war
this
plague
or
this
fire
and
this
coming
up
of
the
enemy
among
us
which
he
owned
to
be
very
considerable
i
to
the
king
playhouse
my
eyes
being
so
bad
since
last
night
straining
of
them
that
i
am
hardly
able
to
see
besides
the
pain
which
i
have
in
them
the
play
was
a
new
play
and
infinitely
full
the
king
and
all
the
court
almost
there
it
is
the
storme
a
play
of
fletcher
which
is
but
methinks
only
there
is
a
most
admirable
dance
at
the
end
of
the
ladies
in
a
military
manner
which
indeed
did
please
me
mightily
creed
and
sheres
come
and
dined
with
me
and
we
had
a
great
deal
of
pretty
discourse
of
the
ceremoniousness
of
the
spaniards
whose
ceremonies
are
so
many
and
so
known
that
he
tells
me
upon
all
occasions
of
joy
or
sorrow
in
a
family
my
lord
embassador
is
fain
to
send
one
with
en
hora
buena
if
it
be
upon
a
marriage
or
birth
of
a
child
or
a
pesa
me
if
it
be
upon
the
death
of
a
child
or
so
and
these
ceremonies
are
so
set
and
the
words
of
the
compliment
that
he
hath
been
sent
from
my
lord
when
he
hath
done
no
more
than
send
in
word
to
the
grandee
that
one
was
there
from
the
embassador
and
he
knowing
what
was
his
errand
that
hath
been
enough
and
he
never
spoken
with
him
nay
several
grandees
having
been
to
marry
a
daughter
have
wrote
letters
to
my
lord
to
give
him
notice
and
out
of
the
greatness
of
his
wisdom
to
desire
his
advice
though
people
he
never
saw
and
then
my
lord
he
answers
by
commending
the
greatness
of
his
discretion
in
making
so
good
an
alliance
and
so
ends
he
says
that
it
is
so
far
from
dishonour
to
a
man
to
give
private
revenge
for
an
affront
that
the
contrary
is
a
disgrace
they
holding
that
he
that
receives
an
affront
is
not
fit
to
appear
in
the
sight
of
the
world
till
he
hath
revenged
himself
and
therefore
that
a
gentleman
there
that
receives
an
affront
oftentimes
never
appears
again
in
the
world
till
he
hath
by
some
private
way
or
other
revenged
himself
and
that
on
this
account
several
have
followed
their
enemies
privately
to
the
indys
thence
to
italy
thence
to
france
and
back
again
waiting
for
an
opportunity
to
be
revenged
he
says
my
lord
was
fain
to
keep
a
letter
from
the
duke
of
york
to
the
queene
of
spain
a
great
while
in
his
hands
before
he
could
think
fit
to
deliver
it
till
he
had
learnt
whether
the
queene
could
receive
it
it
being
directed
to
his
cosen
he
says
that
many
ladies
in
spain
after
they
are
found
to
be
with
child
do
never
stir
out
of
their
beds
or
chambers
till
they
are
brought
to
bed
so
ceremonious
they
are
in
that
point
also
he
tells
me
of
their
wooing
by
serenades
at
the
window
and
that
their
friends
do
always
make
the
match
but
yet
they
have
opportunities
to
meet
at
masse
at
church
and
there
they
make
love
that
the
court
there
hath
no
dancing
nor
visits
at
night
to
see
the
king
or
queene
but
is
always
just
like
a
cloyster
nobody
stirring
in
it
that
my
lord
sandwich
wears
a
beard
now
turned
up
in
the
spanish
manner
but
that
which
pleases
me
most
indeed
is
that
the
peace
which
he
hath
made
with
spain
is
now
printed
here
and
is
acknowledged
by
all
the
merchants
to
be
the
best
peace
that
ever
england
had
with
them
and
it
appears
that
the
king
thinks
it
so
for
this
is
printed
before
the
ratification
is
gone
over
whereas
what
with
france
and
holland
was
not
in
a
good
while
after
till
copys
came
over
of
it
in
english
out
of
holland
and
france
that
it
was
a
reproach
not
to
have
it
printed
here
this
i
am
mighty
glad
of
and
is
the
first
and
only
piece
of
good
news
or
thing
fit
to
be
owned
that
this
nation
hath
done
several
years
all
the
morning
at
the
office
busy
upon
an
order
of
council
wherein
they
are
mightily
at
a
loss
what
to
advise
about
our
discharging
of
seamen
by
ticket
there
being
no
money
to
pay
their
wages
before
january
after
dinner
comes
sir
fr
hollis
to
me
about
business
and
i
with
him
by
coach
to
the
temple
and
there
i
light
all
the
way
he
telling
me
romantic
lies
of
himself
and
his
family
how
they
have
been
for
grimsby
he
and
his
forefathers
this
years
and
his
father
is
now
and
himself
at
this
day
stands
for
to
be
with
his
father
jervas
hollis
and
sir
frecheville
hollis
represented
grimsby
in
chamberlaynes
antiquae
notitia
by
the
death
of
his
fellow
burgess
and
that
he
believes
it
will
cost
him
as
much
as
it
did
his
predecessor
which
was
in
ale
and
in
buttered
ale
which
i
believe
is
one
of
his
devilish
lies
to
the
duke
of
york
to
council
where
the
officers
of
the
navy
did
attend
and
my
lord
ashly
did
move
that
an
assignment
for
money
on
the
act
might
be
put
into
the
hands
of
the
east
india
company
or
city
of
london
which
he
thought
the
seamen
would
believe
but
this
my
lord
anglesy
did
very
handsomely
oppose
and
i
think
did
carry
it
that
it
will
not
be
and
it
is
indeed
a
mean
thing
that
the
king
should
so
far
own
his
own
want
of
credit
as
to
borrow
theirs
in
this
manner
my
lord
anglesy
told
him
that
this
was
the
way
indeed
to
teach
the
parliament
to
trust
the
king
no
more
for
the
time
to
come
but
to
have
a
kingdom
treasurer
distinct
from
the
king
october
to
white
hall
and
there
in
the
boarded
gallery
did
hear
the
musick
with
which
the
king
is
presented
this
night
by
monsieur
grebus
the
master
of
his
musick
both
instrumental
i
think
violins
and
vocall
an
english
song
upon
peace
but
god
forgive
me
i
never
was
so
little
pleased
with
a
concert
of
music
in
my
life
the
manner
of
setting
of
words
and
repeating
them
out
of
order
and
that
with
a
number
of
voices
makes
me
sick
the
whole
design
of
vocall
musick
being
lost
by
it
here
was
a
great
press
of
people
but
i
did
not
see
many
pleased
with
it
only
the
instrumental
musick
he
had
brought
by
practice
to
play
very
just
to
james
where
sir
coventry
took
me
into
the
gallery
and
walked
with
me
an
hour
discoursing
of
navy
business
and
with
much
kindness
to
and
confidence
in
me
still
which
i
must
endeavour
to
preserve
and
will
do
and
good
man
all
his
care
how
to
get
the
navy
paid
off
and
that
all
other
things
therein
may
go
well
he
gone
i
thence
to
my
lady
peterborough
who
sent
for
me
and
with
her
an
hour
talking
about
her
husband
pension
and
how
she
hath
got
an
order
for
its
being
paid
again
though
i
believe
for
all
that
order
it
will
hardly
be
but
of
that
i
said
nothing
but
her
design
is
to
get
it
paid
again
and
how
to
raise
money
upon
it
to
clear
it
from
the
engagement
which
lies
upon
it
to
some
citizens
who
lent
her
husband
money
without
her
knowledge
upon
it
to
vast
loss
she
intends
to
force
them
to
take
their
money
again
and
release
her
husband
of
those
hard
terms
the
woman
is
a
very
wise
woman
and
is
very
plain
in
telling
me
how
her
plate
and
jewels
are
at
pawne
for
money
and
how
they
are
forced
to
live
beyond
their
estate
and
do
get
nothing
by
his
being
a
courtier
the
lady
i
pity
and
her
family
to
my
lord
crewe
and
there
did
stay
with
him
an
hour
till
almost
night
discoursing
about
the
ill
state
of
my
lord
sandwich
that
he
can
neither
be
got
to
be
called
home
nor
money
got
to
maintain
him
there
in
spain
which
will
ruin
his
family
and
the
truth
is
he
do
almost
deserve
it
for
by
all
relation
he
hath
in
little
more
than
a
year
and
half
spent
of
the
king
money
and
the
best
part
of
of
his
own
which
is
a
most
prodigious
expence
more
than
ever
embassador
spent
there
and
more
than
these
commissioners
of
the
treasury
will
or
do
allow
and
they
demand
an
account
before
they
will
give
him
any
more
money
which
puts
all
his
friends
to
a
loss
what
to
answer
but
more
money
we
must
get
him
or
to
be
called
home
i
offer
to
speak
to
sir
coventry
about
it
but
my
lord
will
not
advise
to
it
without
consent
of
sir
carteret
up
and
to
the
office
and
there
all
the
morning
none
but
my
lord
anglesy
and
myself
but
much
surprized
with
the
news
of
the
death
of
sir
batten
who
died
this
morning
having
been
but
two
days
sick
sir
pen
and
i
did
dispatch
a
letter
this
morning
to
sir
coventry
to
recommend
colonell
middleton
who
we
think
a
most
honest
and
understanding
man
and
fit
for
that
place
sir
carteret
did
also
come
this
morning
and
walked
with
me
in
the
garden
and
concluded
not
to
concern
or
have
any
advice
made
to
sir
coventry
in
behalf
of
my
lord
business
so
i
do
rest
satisfied
though
i
do
think
they
are
all
mad
that
they
will
judge
sir
coventry
an
enemy
when
he
is
indeed
no
such
man
to
any
body
but
is
severe
and
just
as
he
ought
to
be
where
he
sees
things
ill
done
to
the
king
house
and
there
going
in
met
with
knipp
and
she
took
us
up
into
the
and
to
the
women
shift
where
nell
was
dressing
herself
and
was
all
unready
and
is
very
pretty
prettier
than
i
thought
and
into
the
and
there
sat
down
and
she
gave
us
fruit
and
here
i
read
the
questions
to
knipp
while
she
answered
me
through
all
her
part
of
flora
figarys
which
was
acted
but
lord
to
see
how
they
were
both
painted
would
make
a
man
mad
and
did
make
me
loath
them
and
what
base
company
of
men
comes
among
them
and
how
lewdly
they
talk
and
how
poor
the
men
are
in
clothes
and
yet
what
a
show
they
make
on
the
stage
by
is
very
observable
but
to
see
how
nell
cursed
for
having
so
few
people
in
the
pit
was
strange
the
other
house
carrying
away
all
the
people
at
the
new
play
and
is
said
to
have
generally
most
company
as
being
better
players
by
and
by
into
the
pit
and
there
saw
the
play
which
is
pretty
good
i
and
my
wife
and
willet
pepys
maid
set
out
in
a
coach
i
have
hired
with
four
horses
and
hewer
and
murford
rode
by
us
on
and
before
night
come
to
stafford
stortford
took
coach
to
and
did
go
all
over
the
house
and
garden
and
mighty
merry
we
were
the
house
indeed
do
appear
very
fine
but
not
so
fine
as
it
hath
heretofore
to
me
particularly
the
ceilings
are
not
so
good
as
i
always
took
them
to
be
being
nothing
so
well
wrought
as
my
lord
are
and
though
the
figure
of
the
house
without
be
very
extraordinary
good
yet
the
is
exceeding
poor
and
a
great
many
pictures
and
not
one
good
one
in
the
house
but
one
of
harry
the
eighth
done
by
holben
and
not
one
good
suit
of
hangings
in
all
the
house
but
all
most
ancient
things
such
as
i
would
not
give
the
in
my
house
and
the
other
furniture
beds
and
other
things
accordingly
only
the
gallery
is
good
and
above
all
things
the
cellars
where
we
went
down
and
drank
of
much
good
liquor
and
indeed
the
cellars
are
fine
and
here
my
wife
and
i
did
sing
to
my
great
content
and
then
to
the
garden
and
there
eat
many
grapes
and
took
some
with
us
and
so
away
thence
exceeding
well
satisfied
though
not
to
that
degree
that
by
my
old
esteem
of
the
house
i
ought
and
did
expect
to
have
done
the
situation
of
it
not
pleasing
me
thence
away
to
cambridge
and
did
take
up
at
the
rose
up
and
got
ready
and
eat
our
breakfast
and
then
took
coach
and
the
poor
as
they
did
yesterday
did
stand
at
the
coach
to
have
something
given
them
as
they
do
to
all
great
persons
and
i
did
give
them
something
and
the
town
musick
did
also
come
and
play
but
lord
what
sad
musick
they
made
so
through
the
town
and
observed
at
our
college
of
magdalene
the
posts
new
painted
and
understand
that
the
vice
chancellor
is
there
this
year
and
so
away
for
huntingdon
and
come
to
brampton
at
about
noon
and
there
find
my
father
and
sister
and
brother
all
well
and
up
and
down
to
see
the
garden
with
my
father
and
the
house
and
do
altogether
find
it
very
pretty
and
i
bless
god
that
i
am
like
to
have
such
a
pretty
place
to
retire
to
after
dinner
i
walked
up
to
hinchingbroke
where
my
lady
expected
me
and
there
spent
all
the
afternoon
with
her
the
same
most
excellent
good
discreet
lady
that
ever
she
was
and
among
other
things
is
mightily
pleased
with
the
lady
that
is
like
to
be
her
son
hinchingbroke
wife
i
am
pleased
with
my
lady
paulina
a
mistake
for
lady
catherine
lady
paulina
being
dead
and
anne
who
are
both
grown
very
proper
ladies
and
handsome
enough
but
i
do
find
by
my
lady
that
they
are
reduced
to
great
straits
for
money
having
been
forced
to
sell
her
plate
or
worth
and
she
is
now
going
to
sell
a
suit
of
her
best
hangings
of
which
i
could
almost
wish
to
buy
a
piece
or
two
if
the
pieces
will
be
broke
but
the
house
is
most
excellently
furnished
and
brave
rooms
and
good
pictures
so
that
it
do
please
me
infinitely
beyond
audley
end
up
to
walk
up
and
down
in
the
garden
with
my
father
to
talk
of
all
our
concernments
about
a
husband
for
my
sister
whereof
there
is
at
present
no
appearance
but
we
must
endeavour
to
find
her
one
now
for
she
grows
old
and
ugly
my
father
and
i
with
a
dark
lantern
it
being
now
night
into
the
garden
with
my
wife
and
there
went
about
our
great
work
to
dig
up
my
gold
but
lord
what
a
tosse
i
was
for
some
time
in
that
they
could
not
justly
tell
where
it
was
but
by
and
by
poking
with
a
spit
we
found
it
and
then
begun
with
a
spudd
to
lift
up
the
ground
but
good
god
to
see
how
sillily
they
did
it
not
half
a
foot
under
ground
and
in
the
sight
of
the
world
from
a
hundred
places
if
any
body
by
accident
were
near
hand
and
within
sight
of
a
neighbour
window
only
my
father
says
that
he
saw
them
all
gone
to
church
before
he
began
the
work
when
he
laid
the
money
but
i
was
out
of
my
wits
almost
and
the
more
from
that
upon
my
lifting
up
the
earth
with
the
spudd
i
did
discern
that
i
had
scattered
the
pieces
of
gold
round
about
the
ground
among
the
grass
and
loose
earth
and
taking
up
the
iron
wherein
they
were
put
i
perceived
the
earth
was
got
among
the
gold
and
wet
so
that
the
bags
were
all
rotten
and
all
the
notes
that
i
could
not
tell
what
in
the
world
to
say
to
it
not
knowing
how
to
judge
what
was
wanting
or
what
had
been
lost
by
gibson
in
his
coming
down
which
all
put
together
did
make
me
mad
and
at
last
i
was
forced
to
take
up
the
dirt
and
all
and
as
many
of
the
scattered
pieces
as
i
could
with
the
dirt
discern
by
candle
light
and
carry
them
up
into
my
chamber
and
there
locke
them
up
till
i
had
eat
a
little
supper
and
then
all
people
going
to
bed
hewer
and
i
did
all
alone
with
several
pails
of
water
and
besoms
at
last
wash
the
dirt
off
the
pieces
and
parted
the
pieces
and
the
dirt
and
then
began
to
tell
them
by
a
note
which
i
had
of
the
value
of
the
whole
in
my
pocket
and
do
find
that
there
was
short
above
a
hundred
pieces
which
did
make
me
mad
and
considering
that
the
neighbour
house
was
so
near
that
we
could
not
possibly
speak
one
to
another
in
the
garden
at
that
place
where
the
gold
lay
especially
my
father
being
deaf
but
they
must
know
what
we
had
been
doing
i
feared
that
they
might
in
the
night
come
and
gather
some
pieces
and
prevent
us
the
next
morning
so
hewer
and
i
out
again
about
midnight
for
it
was
now
grown
so
late
and
there
by
did
make
shift
to
gather
pieces
more
and
so
in
and
to
cleanse
them
and
by
this
time
it
was
past
two
in
the
morning
and
so
to
bed
and
there
lay
in
some
disquiet
all
night
telling
of
the
clock
till
it
was
and
then
hewer
and
i
with
pails
and
a
sieve
did
lock
ourselves
into
the
garden
and
there
gather
all
the
earth
about
the
place
into
pails
and
then
sift
those
pails
in
one
of
the
just
as
they
do
for
dyamonds
in
other
parts
of
the
world
and
there
to
our
great
content
did
by
nine
make
the
last
night
up
so
that
we
are
come
to
about
twenty
or
thirty
of
what
i
think
the
true
number
should
be
so
do
leave
my
father
to
make
a
second
examination
of
the
dirt
and
my
mind
at
rest
in
it
being
but
an
accident
and
so
give
me
some
kind
of
content
to
remember
how
painful
it
is
sometimes
to
keep
money
as
well
as
to
get
it
and
how
doubtful
i
was
to
keep
it
all
night
and
how
to
secure
it
to
london
about
ten
took
coach
my
wife
and
i
and
willett
and
hewer
and
murford
and
bowles
whom
my
lady
lent
me
to
go
along
with
me
my
journey
not
telling
her
the
reason
but
it
was
only
to
secure
my
gold
and
my
brother
john
on
horseback
and
with
these
four
i
thought
myself
pretty
safe
my
gold
i
put
into
a
basket
and
set
under
one
of
the
seats
and
so
my
work
every
quarter
of
an
hour
was
to
look
to
see
whether
all
was
well
and
i
did
ride
in
great
fear
all
the
day
by
five
got
home
where
i
find
all
well
and
did
bring
my
gold
to
my
heart
content
very
safe
having
not
this
day
carried
it
in
a
basket
but
in
our
hands
the
girl
took
care
of
one
and
my
wife
another
bag
and
i
the
rest
i
being
afraid
of
the
bottom
of
the
coach
lest
it
should
break
at
home
we
find
that
sir
batten
body
was
carried
from
hence
with
a
hundred
or
two
of
coaches
to
walthamstow
and
there
buried
the
parliament
met
on
thursday
last
and
adjourned
to
monday
next
the
king
did
make
them
a
very
kind
speech
promising
them
to
leave
all
to
them
to
do
and
call
to
account
what
and
whom
they
pleased
and
declared
by
my
lord
keeper
how
many
actes
he
had
done
since
he
saw
them
among
others
disbanding
the
army
and
putting
all
papists
out
of
employment
and
displacing
persons
that
had
managed
their
business
ill
the
parliament
is
mightily
pleased
with
the
speech
and
voted
giving
him
thanks
for
what
he
said
and
hath
done
and
among
other
things
would
by
name
thank
him
for
displacing
my
lord
chancellor
for
which
a
great
many
did
speak
in
the
house
but
it
was
opposed
by
some
and
particularly
harry
coventry
who
got
that
it
should
be
put
to
a
committee
to
consider
what
particulars
to
mention
in
their
thanks
to
the
king
saying
that
it
was
too
soon
to
give
thanks
for
the
displacing
of
a
man
before
they
knew
or
had
examined
what
was
the
cause
of
his
displacing
and
so
it
rested
but
this
do
show
that
they
are
and
will
be
very
high
and
pierce
do
tell
me
that
he
fears
and
do
hear
that
it
hath
been
said
among
them
that
they
will
move
for
the
calling
my
lord
sandwich
home
to
bring
him
to
account
which
do
trouble
me
mightily
but
i
trust
it
will
not
be
so
anon
comes
home
sir
pen
from
the
buriall
and
he
says
that
lady
batten
and
her
are
all
broke
in
pieces
and
that
there
is
but
found
in
the
world
of
money
and
is
in
great
doubt
what
we
shall
do
towards
the
doing
ourselves
right
with
them
about
the
prize
money
to
james
and
there
to
the
duke
of
york
chamber
and
there
he
was
dressing
and
many
lords
and
come
to
kiss
his
hands
they
being
newly
come
to
town
and
then
the
duke
of
york
did
of
himself
call
me
to
him
and
tell
me
that
he
had
spoke
to
the
king
and
that
the
king
had
granted
me
the
ship
asked
for
and
did
moreover
say
that
he
was
mightily
pleased
with
my
service
and
that
he
would
be
willing
to
do
any
thing
that
was
in
his
power
for
me
which
he
said
with
mighty
kindness
which
i
did
return
him
thanks
for
and
departed
with
mighty
joy
more
than
i
did
expect
and
so
walked
over
the
park
to
white
hall
and
then
met
sir
cholmly
who
walked
with
me
and
told
me
most
of
the
news
heard
last
night
of
the
parliament
and
thinks
they
will
do
all
things
very
well
only
they
will
be
revenged
of
my
lord
chancellor
and
says
however
that
he
thinks
there
will
be
but
two
things
proved
on
him
and
that
one
is
that
he
may
have
said
to
the
king
and
to
others
words
to
breed
in
the
king
an
ill
opinion
of
the
parliament
that
they
were
factious
and
that
it
was
better
to
dissolve
them
and
this
he
thinks
they
will
be
able
to
prove
but
what
this
will
amount
to
he
knows
not
and
next
that
he
hath
taken
money
for
several
bargains
that
have
been
made
with
the
crown
and
did
instance
one
that
is
already
complained
of
but
there
are
so
many
more
involved
in
it
that
should
they
unravel
things
of
this
sort
every
body
almost
will
be
more
or
less
concerned
but
these
are
the
two
great
points
which
he
thinks
they
will
insist
on
and
prove
against
him
to
mr
wren
and
he
told
me
that
my
business
was
done
about
my
warrant
on
the
maybolt
galliott
which
i
did
see
and
thought
it
was
not
so
full
in
the
reciting
of
my
services
as
the
other
was
in
that
of
sir
pen
yet
i
was
well
pleased
with
it
and
do
intend
to
fetch
it
away
anon
to
visit
sir
carteret
and
from
him
do
understand
that
the
king
himself
but
this
he
told
me
as
a
great
secret
is
satisfied
that
these
thanks
which
he
expects
from
the
house
for
the
laying
aside
of
my
lord
chancellor
are
a
thing
irregular
but
since
it
is
come
into
the
house
he
do
think
it
necessary
to
carry
it
on
and
will
have
it
and
hath
made
his
mind
known
to
be
so
to
some
of
the
house
but
sir
carteret
do
say
he
knows
nothing
of
what
my
lord
brouncker
told
us
that
the
king
was
angry
with
the
duke
of
york
yesterday
and
advised
him
not
to
hinder
what
he
had
a
mind
to
have
done
touching
this
business
which
is
news
very
bad
if
true
he
tells
me
also
that
the
king
will
have
the
thanks
of
the
house
go
on
and
commends
my
lord
keeper
speech
for
all
but
what
he
was
forced
to
say
about
the
reason
of
the
king
sending
away
the
house
so
soon
the
last
time
when
they
were
met
at
home
most
of
the
morning
with
sir
cholmly
about
some
accounts
of
his
and
for
news
he
tells
me
that
the
commons
and
lords
have
concurred
and
delivered
the
king
their
thanks
among
other
things
for
his
removal
of
the
chancellor
who
took
their
thanks
very
well
and
among
other
things
promised
them
in
these
words
never
in
any
degree
to
give
the
chancellor
any
employment
again
and
he
tells
me
that
it
is
very
true
he
hath
it
from
one
that
was
by
that
the
king
did
give
the
duke
of
york
a
sound
reprimande
told
him
that
he
had
lived
with
him
with
more
kindness
than
ever
any
brother
king
lived
with
a
brother
and
that
he
lived
as
much
like
a
monarch
as
himself
but
advised
him
not
to
cross
him
in
his
designs
about
the
chancellor
in
which
the
duke
of
york
do
very
wisely
acquiesce
and
will
be
quiet
as
the
king
bade
him
but
presently
commands
all
his
friends
to
be
silent
in
the
business
of
the
chancellor
and
they
were
so
but
that
the
chancellor
hath
done
all
that
is
possible
to
provoke
the
king
and
to
bring
himself
to
lose
his
head
by
enraging
of
people
to
the
duke
of
york
house
and
i
was
vexed
to
see
young
who
is
but
a
bad
actor
at
best
act
macbeth
in
the
room
of
betterton
who
poor
man
is
sick
the
parliament
run
on
mighty
furiously
having
yesterday
been
almost
all
the
morning
complaining
against
some
high
proceedings
of
my
lord
chief
justice
keeling
that
the
gentlemen
of
the
country
did
complain
against
him
in
the
house
and
run
very
high
it
is
the
man
that
did
fall
out
with
my
cosen
roger
pepys
once
at
the
assizes
there
and
would
have
laid
him
by
the
heels
but
it
seems
a
very
able
lawyer
this
afternoon
my
lord
anglesy
tells
us
that
the
house
of
commons
have
this
morning
run
into
the
enquiry
in
many
things
as
the
sale
of
dunkirke
the
dividing
of
the
fleet
the
last
year
the
business
of
the
prizes
with
my
lord
sandwich
and
many
other
things
so
that
now
they
begin
to
fall
close
upon
it
and
god
knows
what
will
be
the
end
of
it
but
a
committee
they
have
chosen
to
enquire
into
the
miscarriages
of
the
war
to
white
hall
and
there
attended
the
duke
of
york
but
first
we
find
him
to
spend
above
an
hour
in
private
in
his
closet
with
sir
coventry
which
i
was
glad
to
see
that
there
is
so
much
confidence
between
them
by
and
by
we
were
called
in
the
duke
of
york
considering
that
the
king
had
a
mind
for
spragg
to
command
the
rupert
which
would
not
be
well
by
turning
out
hubbard
who
is
a
good
man
said
he
did
not
know
whether
he
did
so
well
conforme
as
at
this
time
to
please
the
people
and
parliament
sir
coventry
answered
and
the
duke
of
york
merrily
agreed
to
it
that
it
was
very
hard
to
know
what
it
was
that
the
parliament
would
call
conformity
at
this
time
full
of
my
desire
of
seeing
my
lord
orrery
new
play
this
afternoon
at
the
king
house
the
black
prince
the
first
time
it
is
acted
where
though
we
came
by
two
yet
there
was
no
room
in
the
pit
but
were
forced
to
go
into
one
of
the
upper
boxes
at
a
piece
which
is
the
first
time
i
ever
sat
in
a
box
in
my
life
and
in
the
same
box
came
by
and
by
behind
me
my
lord
barkeley
and
his
lady
but
i
did
not
turn
my
face
to
them
to
be
known
so
that
i
was
excused
from
giving
them
my
seat
and
this
pleasure
i
had
that
from
this
place
the
scenes
do
appear
very
fine
indeed
and
much
better
than
in
the
pit
the
house
infinite
full
and
the
king
and
duke
of
york
there
the
whole
house
was
mightily
pleased
all
along
till
the
reading
of
a
letter
which
was
so
long
and
so
unnecessary
that
they
frequently
began
to
laugh
and
to
hiss
twenty
times
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
king
being
there
they
had
certainly
hissed
it
off
the
stage
lord
day
up
and
put
on
my
new
tunique
of
velvett
which
is
very
plain
but
good
this
morning
is
brought
to
me
an
order
for
the
presenting
the
committee
of
parliament
with
a
list
of
the
commanders
and
ships
names
of
all
the
fleets
set
out
since
the
war
and
particularly
of
those
ships
which
are
divided
from
the
fleet
with
prince
rupert
which
gives
me
occasion
to
see
that
they
are
busy
after
that
business
and
i
am
glad
of
it
this
afternoon
comes
to
me
captain
about
a
ship
that
the
king
hath
given
him
and
he
and
i
to
talk
of
the
parliament
and
he
tells
me
that
the
business
of
the
duke
of
york
slackening
sail
in
the
first
fight
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
is
brought
into
question
and
sir
penn
and
captain
cox
are
to
appear
about
it
and
it
is
thought
will
at
last
be
laid
upon
brouncker
giving
orders
from
the
duke
of
york
which
the
duke
of
york
do
not
own
to
captain
cox
to
do
it
but
it
seems
they
do
resent
this
very
highly
and
are
mad
in
going
through
all
business
where
they
can
lay
any
fault
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
in
the
world
i
am
as
kindly
spoke
of
as
any
body
for
for
aught
i
see
there
is
bloody
work
like
to
be
sir
coventry
having
been
forced
to
produce
a
letter
in
parliament
wherein
the
duke
of
albemarle
did
from
sheernesse
write
in
what
good
posture
all
things
were
at
chatham
and
that
they
were
so
well
placed
that
he
feared
no
attempt
of
the
enemy
so
that
among
other
things
i
do
see
every
body
is
upon
his
own
defence
and
spares
not
to
blame
another
to
defend
himself
and
the
same
course
i
shall
take
but
god
knows
where
it
will
end
pelling
tells
me
that
my
lady
duchesse
albemarle
was
at
this
afternoon
she
being
ill
and
did
there
publickly
talk
of
business
and
of
our
office
and
that
she
believed
that
i
was
safe
and
had
done
well
and
so
i
thank
god
i
hear
every
body
speaks
of
me
and
indeed
i
think
without
vanity
i
may
expect
to
be
profited
rather
than
injured
by
this
inquiry
which
the
parliament
makes
into
business
to
westminster
and
up
to
the
lobby
where
many
commanders
of
the
fleet
were
and
captain
cox
and
pierce
the
surgeon
the
last
of
whom
hath
been
in
the
house
and
declared
that
he
heard
brouncker
advise
and
give
arguments
to
cox
for
the
safety
of
the
duke
of
york
person
to
shorten
sail
that
they
might
not
be
in
the
middle
of
the
enemy
in
the
morning
alone
and
cox
denying
to
observe
his
advice
having
received
the
duke
of
commands
over
night
to
keep
within
as
they
then
were
of
the
enemy
brouncker
did
go
to
harman
and
used
the
same
arguments
and
told
him
that
he
was
sure
it
would
be
well
pleasing
to
the
king
that
care
should
be
taken
of
not
endangering
the
duke
of
york
and
after
much
persuasion
harman
was
heard
to
say
why
if
it
must
be
then
lower
the
topsail
and
so
did
shorten
sail
to
the
loss
as
the
parliament
will
have
it
of
the
greatest
victory
that
ever
was
and
which
would
have
saved
all
the
expence
of
blood
and
money
and
honour
that
followed
and
this
they
do
resent
so
as
to
put
it
to
the
question
whether
brouncker
should
not
be
carried
to
the
tower
who
do
confess
that
out
of
kindness
to
the
duke
of
york
safety
he
did
advise
that
they
should
do
so
but
did
not
use
the
duke
of
york
name
therein
and
so
it
was
only
his
error
in
advising
it
but
the
greatest
theirs
in
taking
it
contrary
to
order
at
last
it
ended
that
it
should
be
suspended
till
harman
comes
home
and
then
the
do
all
tell
me
that
it
will
fall
heavy
and
they
think
be
fatal
to
brouncker
or
him
sir
pen
tells
me
he
was
gone
to
bed
having
been
all
day
labouring
and
then
not
able
to
stand
of
the
gout
and
did
give
order
for
the
keeping
the
sails
standing
as
they
then
were
all
night
but
which
i
wonder
at
he
tells
me
that
he
did
not
know
the
next
day
that
they
had
shortened
sail
nor
ever
did
enquire
into
it
till
about
ten
days
ago
that
this
began
to
be
mentioned
and
indeed
it
is
charged
privately
as
a
fault
on
the
duke
of
york
that
he
did
not
presently
examine
the
reason
of
the
breach
of
his
orders
and
punish
it
but
cox
tells
me
that
he
did
finally
refuse
it
and
what
prevailed
with
harman
he
knows
not
and
do
think
that
we
might
have
done
considerable
service
on
the
enemy
the
next
day
if
this
had
not
been
done
thus
this
business
ended
having
kept
them
till
almost
two
and
then
i
by
coach
with
sir
pen
as
far
as
clement
talking
of
this
matter
and
there
set
down
and
i
walked
to
sir
carteret
and
there
dined
with
him
and
several
who
i
perceive
do
all
look
upon
it
as
a
thing
certain
that
the
parliament
will
enquire
into
every
thing
and
will
be
very
severe
where
they
can
find
any
fault
sir
coventry
i
hear
did
this
day
make
a
speech
in
apology
for
his
reading
the
letter
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
concerning
the
good
condition
which
chatham
was
in
before
the
enemy
came
thither
declaring
his
simple
intention
therein
without
prejudice
to
my
lord
and
i
am
told
that
he
was
also
with
the
duke
of
albemarle
yesterday
to
excuse
it
but
this
day
i
do
hear
by
some
of
sir
coventry
friends
that
they
think
he
hath
done
himself
much
injury
by
making
this
man
and
his
interest
so
much
his
enemy
after
dinner
i
away
to
westminster
and
up
to
the
parliament
house
and
there
did
wait
with
great
patience
till
seven
at
night
to
be
called
in
to
the
committee
who
sat
all
this
afternoon
examining
the
business
of
chatham
and
at
last
was
called
in
and
told
that
the
least
they
expected
from
us
wren
had
promised
them
and
only
bade
me
to
bring
all
my
thither
afternoon
sir
robert
brookes
in
the
chair
methinks
a
sorry
fellow
to
be
there
because
a
young
man
and
yet
he
seems
to
speak
very
well
i
gone
thence
my
cosen
pepys
comes
out
to
me
and
walks
in
the
hall
with
me
and
bids
me
prepare
to
answer
to
every
thing
for
they
do
seem
to
lay
the
business
of
chatham
upon
the
commissioners
of
the
navy
and
they
are
resolved
to
lay
the
fault
heavy
somewhere
and
to
punish
it
and
prays
me
to
prepare
to
save
myself
and
gives
me
hints
what
to
prepare
against
which
i
am
obliged
to
him
for
this
day
i
did
get
a
list
of
the
fourteen
particular
miscarriages
which
are
already
before
the
committee
to
be
examined
wherein
besides
two
or
three
that
will
concern
this
office
much
there
are
those
of
the
prizes
and
that
of
bergen
and
not
following
the
dutch
ships
against
my
lord
sandwich
that
i
fear
will
ruin
him
unless
he
hath
very
good
luck
or
they
may
be
in
better
temper
before
he
can
come
to
be
charged
but
my
heart
is
full
of
fear
for
him
and
his
family
i
hear
that
they
do
prosecute
the
business
against
my
lord
chief
justice
keeling
with
great
severity
slept
but
ill
all
the
last
part
of
the
night
for
fear
of
this
day
success
in
parliament
therefore
up
and
all
of
us
all
the
morning
close
till
almost
two
collecting
all
we
had
to
say
and
had
done
from
the
beginning
touching
the
safety
of
the
river
medway
and
chatham
and
having
done
this
and
put
it
into
order
we
away
i
not
having
time
to
eat
my
dinner
and
so
all
in
my
lord
brouncker
coach
that
is
to
say
brouncker
pen
hater
and
myself
talking
of
the
other
great
matter
with
which
they
charge
us
that
is
of
discharging
men
by
ticket
in
order
to
our
defence
in
case
that
should
be
asked
we
came
to
the
and
there
after
a
little
waiting
till
the
committee
was
sat
we
were
the
house
being
very
full
called
in
sir
pen
went
in
and
sat
as
a
member
and
my
lord
brouncker
would
not
at
first
go
in
expecting
to
have
a
chair
set
for
him
and
his
brother
had
bid
him
not
go
in
till
he
was
called
for
but
after
a
few
words
i
had
occasion
to
mention
him
and
so
he
was
called
in
but
without
any
more
chair
or
respect
paid
him
than
myself
and
so
brouncker
and
hater
and
i
were
there
to
answer
and
i
had
a
chair
brought
me
to
lean
my
books
upon
and
so
did
give
them
such
an
account
in
a
series
of
the
whole
business
that
had
passed
the
office
touching
the
matter
and
so
answered
all
questions
given
me
about
it
that
i
did
not
perceive
but
they
were
fully
satisfied
with
me
and
the
business
as
to
our
office
and
then
commissioner
pett
who
was
by
at
all
my
discourse
and
this
held
till
within
an
hour
after
for
i
had
candles
brought
in
to
read
my
papers
by
was
to
answer
for
himself
we
having
lodged
all
matters
with
him
for
execution
but
lord
what
a
tumultuous
thing
this
committee
is
for
all
the
reputation
they
have
of
a
great
council
is
a
strange
consideration
there
being
as
impertinent
questions
and
as
disorderly
proposed
as
any
man
could
make
but
commissioner
pett
of
all
men
living
did
make
the
weakest
defence
of
himself
nothing
to
the
purpose
nor
to
satisfaction
nor
certain
but
sometimes
one
thing
and
sometimes
another
sometimes
for
himself
and
sometimes
against
him
and
h
s
greatest
failure
was
that
i
observed
from
his
considering
whether
the
question
propounded
was
his
part
to
answer
or
no
and
the
thing
to
be
done
was
his
work
to
do
the
want
of
which
distinction
will
overthrow
him
for
he
concerns
himself
in
giving
an
account
of
the
disposal
of
the
boats
which
he
had
no
reason
at
all
to
do
or
take
any
blame
upon
him
for
them
he
charged
the
not
carrying
up
of
the
charles
upon
the
tuesday
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
but
i
see
the
house
is
mighty
favourable
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
would
give
little
weight
to
it
and
something
of
want
of
armes
he
spoke
which
sir
duncomb
answered
with
great
imperiousness
and
earnestness
but
for
all
that
i
do
see
the
house
is
resolved
to
be
better
satisfied
in
the
business
of
the
unreadiness
of
sheernesse
and
want
of
armes
and
ammunition
there
and
every
where
and
all
their
officers
were
here
attending
but
only
one
called
in
about
armes
for
boats
to
answer
commissioner
pett
none
of
my
brethren
said
anything
but
me
there
but
only
two
or
three
silly
words
my
lord
brouncker
gave
in
answer
to
one
question
about
the
number
of
men
that
were
in
the
king
yard
at
the
time
at
last
the
house
dismissed
us
and
shortly
after
did
adjourn
the
debate
till
friday
next
and
my
cosen
pepys
did
come
out
and
joy
me
in
my
acquitting
myself
so
well
and
so
did
several
others
and
my
fellow
officers
all
very
briske
to
see
themselves
so
well
acquitted
which
makes
me
a
little
proud
but
yet
not
secure
but
we
may
yet
meet
with
a
which
we
see
not
to
white
hall
there
to
attend
the
duke
of
york
but
came
a
little
too
late
and
so
missed
it
only
spoke
with
him
and
heard
him
correct
my
lord
barkeley
who
fell
foul
on
sir
edward
spragg
who
it
seems
said
yesterday
to
the
house
that
if
the
officers
of
the
ordnance
had
done
as
much
work
at
sheernesse
in
ten
weeks
as
the
prince
did
in
ten
days
he
could
have
defended
the
place
against
the
dutch
but
the
duke
of
york
told
him
that
every
body
must
have
liberty
at
this
time
to
make
their
own
defence
though
it
be
to
the
charging
of
the
fault
upon
any
other
so
it
be
true
so
i
perceive
the
whole
world
is
at
work
in
blaming
one
another
thence
sir
pen
and
i
back
into
london
and
there
saw
the
king
with
his
and
trumpets
going
to
the
exchange
to
lay
the
first
stone
of
the
first
pillar
of
the
new
building
of
the
exchange
which
the
gates
being
shut
i
could
not
get
in
to
see
so
with
sir
pen
to
captain
cocke
and
then
again
toward
westminster
but
in
my
way
stopped
at
the
exchange
and
got
in
the
king
being
newly
gone
and
there
find
the
bottom
of
the
first
pillar
laid
and
here
was
a
shed
set
up
and
hung
with
tapestry
and
a
canopy
of
state
and
some
good
victuals
and
wine
for
the
king
who
it
seems
did
it
laid
the
stone
and
so
a
great
many
people
as
tom
killigrew
and
others
of
the
court
there
i
do
find
gauden
in
his
gowne
as
sheriffe
and
understand
that
the
king
hath
this
morning
knighted
him
upon
the
place
which
i
am
mightily
pleased
with
and
i
think
the
other
sheriffe
who
is
davis
he
became
afterwards
lord
mayor
the
little
fellow
my
the
bookseller
who
was
one
of
audley
executors
and
now
become
sheriffe
which
is
a
strange
turn
methinks
to
westminster
hall
where
i
came
just
as
the
house
rose
and
there
in
the
hall
met
with
sir
coventry
who
is
in
pain
to
defend
himself
in
the
business
of
tickets
it
being
said
that
the
paying
of
the
ships
at
chatham
by
ticket
was
by
his
direction
he
says
the
house
was
well
satisfied
with
my
report
yesterday
and
so
several
others
told
me
in
the
hall
that
my
report
was
very
good
and
satisfactory
and
that
i
have
got
advantage
by
it
in
the
house
i
pray
god
it
may
prove
so
to
the
king
playhouse
and
saw
the
black
prince
which
is
now
mightily
bettered
by
that
long
letter
being
printed
and
so
delivered
to
every
body
at
their
going
in
and
some
short
reference
made
to
it
in
the
play
but
here
to
my
great
satisfaction
i
did
see
my
lord
hinchingbroke
and
his
mistress
with
her
father
and
mother
and
i
am
mightily
pleased
with
the
young
lady
being
handsome
enough
and
indeed
to
my
great
liking
as
i
would
have
her
this
day
it
was
moved
in
the
house
that
a
day
might
be
appointed
to
bring
in
an
impeachment
against
the
chancellor
but
it
was
decried
as
being
irregular
but
that
if
there
was
ground
for
complaint
it
might
be
brought
to
the
committee
for
miscarriages
and
if
they
thought
good
to
present
it
to
the
house
and
so
it
was
carried
they
did
also
vote
this
day
thanks
to
be
given
to
the
prince
and
duke
of
albemarle
for
their
care
and
conduct
in
the
last
war
which
is
a
strange
act
but
i
know
not
how
the
blockhead
albemarle
hath
strange
luck
to
be
loved
though
he
be
and
every
man
must
know
it
the
heaviest
man
in
the
world
but
stout
and
honest
to
his
country
this
evening
late
moore
come
to
me
to
prepare
matters
for
my
lord
sandwich
defence
wherein
i
can
little
assist
but
will
do
all
i
can
and
am
in
great
fear
of
nothing
but
the
damned
business
of
the
prizes
but
i
fear
my
lord
will
receive
a
cursed
deal
of
trouble
by
it
up
and
to
make
our
answer
ready
for
the
parliament
this
afternoon
to
show
how
commissioner
pett
was
singly
concerned
in
the
execution
of
all
orders
at
chatham
and
that
we
did
properly
lodge
all
orders
with
him
thence
with
sir
pen
to
the
parliament
committee
and
there
i
had
no
more
matters
asked
me
the
commissioners
of
the
ordnance
being
examined
with
all
severity
and
hardly
used
did
go
away
with
mighty
blame
and
i
am
told
by
every
body
that
it
is
likely
to
stick
mighty
hard
upon
them
at
which
every
body
is
glad
because
of
duncomb
pride
and
their
expecting
to
have
the
thanks
of
the
house
whereas
they
have
deserved
as
the
parliament
apprehends
as
bad
as
bad
can
be
here
is
great
talk
of
an
impeachment
brought
in
against
my
lord
mordaunt
and
that
another
will
be
brought
in
against
my
lord
chancellor
in
a
few
days
here
i
understand
for
certain
that
they
have
ordered
that
my
lord
arlington
letters
and
secretary
morrice
letters
of
intelligence
be
consulted
about
the
business
of
the
dutch
fleet
coming
abroad
and
i
do
hear
how
birch
is
the
man
that
do
examine
and
trouble
every
body
with
his
questions
pierce
tells
me
that
the
two
marshalls
at
the
house
are
stephen
marshall
the
great
presbyterian
daughters
and
that
nelly
and
beck
marshall
falling
out
the
other
day
the
latter
called
the
other
my
lord
buckhurst
mistress
nell
answered
her
i
was
but
one
man
mistress
though
i
was
brought
up
in
a
brothel
to
fill
strong
water
to
the
gentlemen
and
you
are
a
mistress
to
three
or
four
though
a
presbyter
praying
daughter
this
evening
come
sir
minnes
to
me
to
let
me
know
that
a
hath
been
with
him
to
tell
him
that
the
parliament
intend
to
examine
him
particularly
about
sir
coventry
selling
of
places
and
about
my
lord
discharging
the
ships
at
chatham
by
ticket
for
the
former
of
which
i
am
more
particularly
sorry
that
that
business
of
sir
coventry
should
come
up
again
though
this
old
man
tells
me
and
i
believe
that
he
can
say
nothing
to
it
sir
coventry
says
he
is
so
well
armed
to
justify
himself
in
every
thing
unless
in
the
old
business
of
selling
places
when
be
says
every
body
did
and
he
will
now
not
be
forward
to
tell
his
own
story
as
he
hath
been
but
tells
me
he
is
grown
wiser
and
will
put
them
to
prove
any
thing
and
he
will
defend
himself
that
he
is
weary
of
public
employment
and
neither
ever
designed
nor
will
ever
if
his
commission
were
brought
to
him
wrapt
in
gold
accept
of
any
single
place
in
the
state
as
particularly
secretary
of
state
which
he
says
the
world
discourses
morrice
is
willing
to
resign
to
westminster
hall
the
house
sitting
all
this
day
about
the
method
of
bringing
in
the
charge
against
my
lord
chancellor
and
at
last
resolved
for
a
committee
to
draw
up
the
heads
to
the
where
after
the
committee
was
sat
i
was
called
in
and
the
first
thing
was
upon
the
complaint
of
a
dirty
slut
that
was
there
about
a
ticket
which
she
had
lost
and
had
applied
herself
to
me
for
another
i
did
give
them
a
short
and
satisfactory
answer
to
that
and
so
they
sent
her
away
and
were
ashamed
of
their
foolery
in
giving
occasion
to
seamen
and
seamen
wives
to
come
before
them
as
there
were
this
afternoon
i
to
westminster
and
there
at
the
lobby
do
hear
by
commissioner
pett
to
my
great
amazement
that
he
is
in
worse
condition
than
before
by
the
coming
in
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
prince
rupert
narratives
this
day
wherein
the
former
do
most
severely
lay
matters
upon
him
so
as
the
house
this
day
have
i
think
ordered
him
to
the
tower
again
or
something
like
it
so
that
the
poor
man
is
likely
to
be
overthrown
i
doubt
right
or
wrong
so
infinite
fond
they
are
of
any
thing
the
duke
of
albemarle
says
or
writes
to
them
i
did
then
go
down
and
there
met
with
colonell
reames
and
cosen
roger
pepys
and
there
they
do
tell
me
how
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
the
prince
have
laid
blame
on
a
great
many
and
particularly
on
our
office
in
general
and
particularly
for
want
of
provision
wherein
i
shall
come
to
be
questioned
again
in
that
business
myself
which
do
trouble
me
but
my
cosen
pepys
and
i
had
much
discourse
alone
and
he
do
bewail
the
constitution
of
this
house
and
says
there
is
a
direct
caball
and
faction
as
much
as
is
possible
between
those
for
and
against
the
chancellor
and
so
in
other
factions
that
there
is
nothing
almost
done
honestly
and
with
integrity
only
some
few
he
says
there
are
that
do
keep
out
of
all
plots
and
combinations
and
when
their
time
comes
will
speak
and
see
right
done
if
possible
and
that
he
himself
is
looked
upon
to
be
a
man
that
will
be
of
no
faction
and
so
they
do
shun
to
make
him
and
i
am
glad
of
it
he
tells
me
that
he
thanks
god
that
he
never
knew
what
it
was
to
be
tempted
to
be
a
knave
in
his
life
till
he
did
come
into
the
house
of
commons
where
there
is
nothing
done
but
by
passion
and
faction
and
private
interest
i
espied
sir
gauden
coach
and
so
went
out
of
mine
into
his
and
there
had
opportunity
to
talk
of
the
business
of
victuals
which
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
prince
did
complain
that
they
were
in
want
of
the
last
year
but
we
do
conclude
we
shall
be
able
to
show
quite
the
contrary
of
that
only
it
troubles
me
that
we
must
come
to
contend
with
these
great
persons
which
will
overrun
us
november
i
this
morning
before
chapel
visited
sir
carteret
who
is
vexed
to
see
how
things
are
likely
to
go
but
can
not
help
it
and
yet
seems
to
think
himself
mighty
safe
i
also
visited
my
lord
hinchingbroke
at
his
chamber
at
white
hall
where
i
found
turner
moore
and
creed
talking
of
my
lord
sandwich
whose
case
i
doubt
is
but
bad
and
i
fear
will
not
escape
being
worse
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
a
silly
play
and
an
old
one
the
taming
of
a
shrew
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
henry
the
fourth
and
contrary
to
expectation
was
pleased
in
nothing
more
than
in
cartwright
speaking
of
falstaffe
speech
about
what
is
honour
william
cartwright
one
of
killigrew
company
at
the
original
establishment
of
by
his
will
dated
he
left
his
books
pictures
and
furniture
to
dulwich
college
where
his
portrait
still
remains
the
house
full
of
men
it
being
holyday
with
them
and
it
was
observable
how
a
gentleman
of
good
habit
sitting
just
before
us
eating
of
some
fruit
in
the
midst
of
the
play
did
drop
down
as
dead
being
choked
but
with
much
ado
orange
mall
did
thrust
her
finger
down
his
throat
and
brought
him
to
life
again
to
westminster
and
there
landing
at
the
new
exchange
stairs
i
to
sir
coventry
and
there
he
read
over
to
me
the
prince
and
duke
of
albemarle
narratives
wherein
they
are
very
severe
against
him
and
our
office
but
sir
coventry
do
contemn
them
only
that
their
persons
and
qualities
are
great
and
so
i
do
perceive
he
is
afraid
of
them
though
he
will
not
confess
it
but
he
do
say
that
if
he
can
get
out
of
these
briars
he
will
never
trouble
himself
with
princes
nor
dukes
again
he
finds
several
things
in
their
narratives
which
are
both
inconsistent
and
foolish
as
well
as
untrue
sir
cholmly
owns
sir
coventry
in
his
opinion
to
be
one
of
the
worthiest
men
in
the
nation
as
i
do
really
think
he
is
he
tells
me
he
do
think
really
that
they
will
cut
off
my
lord
chancellor
head
the
chancellor
at
this
day
having
as
much
pride
as
is
possible
to
those
few
that
venture
their
fortunes
by
coming
to
see
him
and
that
the
duke
of
york
is
troubled
much
knowing
that
those
that
fling
down
the
chancellor
can
not
stop
there
but
will
do
something
to
him
to
prevent
his
having
it
in
his
power
hereafter
to
avenge
himself
and
upon
them
and
this
sir
cholmly
fears
may
be
by
divorcing
the
queene
and
getting
another
or
declaring
the
duke
of
monmouth
legitimate
which
god
forbid
he
tells
me
he
do
verily
believe
that
there
will
come
in
an
impeachment
of
high
treason
against
my
lord
of
ormond
among
other
things
for
ordering
the
quartering
of
soldiers
in
ireland
on
free
quarters
which
it
seems
is
high
treason
in
that
country
and
was
one
of
the
things
that
lost
the
lord
strafford
his
head
and
the
law
is
not
yet
repealed
which
he
says
was
a
mighty
oversight
of
him
not
to
have
repealed
which
he
might
with
ease
have
done
or
have
justified
himself
by
an
act
at
noon
resolved
with
sir
pen
to
go
to
see
the
tempest
an
old
play
of
shakespeare
acted
i
hear
the
first
day
and
so
my
wife
and
girl
and
hewer
by
themselves
and
sir
pen
and
i
afterwards
by
ourselves
and
forced
to
sit
in
the
side
balcony
over
against
the
at
the
house
close
by
my
lady
dorset
frances
daughter
of
lionel
earl
of
middlesex
wife
of
richard
fifth
earl
of
dorset
and
a
great
many
great
ones
the
house
mighty
full
the
king
and
court
there
and
the
most
innocent
play
that
ever
i
saw
and
a
curious
piece
of
musique
in
an
echo
of
half
sentences
the
echo
repeating
the
former
half
while
the
man
goes
on
to
the
latter
which
is
mighty
pretty
the
play
has
no
great
wit
but
yet
good
above
ordinary
plays
the
house
very
busy
and
like
to
be
so
all
day
about
my
lord
chancellor
impeachment
whether
treason
or
not
to
white
hall
to
speak
with
sir
coventry
and
there
beyond
all
we
looked
for
do
hear
that
the
duke
of
york
hath
got
and
is
full
of
the
and
so
we
to
his
lodgings
and
there
find
most
of
the
family
going
to
james
and
the
locked
up
that
nobody
might
pass
to
nor
fro
and
so
a
sad
house
i
am
sorry
to
see
i
am
sad
to
consider
the
effects
of
his
death
if
he
should
miscarry
but
frazier
tells
me
that
he
is
in
as
good
condition
as
a
man
can
be
in
his
case
they
appeared
last
night
it
seems
he
was
let
blood
on
friday
sir
carteret
and
i
towards
the
temple
in
coach
together
and
there
he
did
tell
me
how
the
king
do
all
he
can
in
the
world
to
overthrow
my
lord
chancellor
and
that
notice
is
taken
of
every
man
about
the
king
that
is
not
seen
to
promote
the
ruine
of
the
chancellor
and
that
this
being
another
great
day
in
his
business
he
dares
not
but
be
there
he
tells
me
that
as
soon
as
secretary
morrice
brought
the
great
seale
from
my
lord
chancellor
bab
may
fell
upon
his
knees
and
catched
the
king
about
the
legs
and
joyed
him
and
said
that
this
was
the
first
time
that
ever
he
could
call
him
king
of
england
being
freed
from
this
great
man
which
was
a
most
ridiculous
saying
and
he
told
me
that
when
first
my
lord
gerard
a
great
while
ago
came
to
the
king
and
told
him
that
the
chancellor
did
say
openly
that
the
king
was
a
lazy
person
and
not
fit
to
govern
which
is
now
made
one
of
the
things
in
people
mouths
against
the
chancellor
why
says
the
king
that
is
no
news
for
he
hath
told
me
so
twenty
times
and
but
the
other
day
he
told
me
so
and
made
matter
of
mirth
at
it
but
yet
this
light
discourse
is
likely
to
prove
bad
to
him
up
and
to
the
office
where
sat
all
the
morning
and
there
hear
that
the
duke
of
york
do
yet
do
very
well
with
his
pray
god
he
may
continue
to
do
so
this
morning
also
to
my
astonishment
i
hear
that
yesterday
my
lord
chancellor
to
another
of
his
articles
that
of
betraying
the
king
councils
to
his
enemies
is
voted
to
have
matter
against
him
for
an
impeachment
of
high
treason
and
that
this
day
the
impeachment
is
to
be
carried
up
to
the
house
of
lords
which
is
very
high
and
i
am
troubled
at
it
for
god
knows
what
will
follow
since
they
that
do
this
must
do
more
to
secure
themselves
against
any
that
will
revenge
this
if
it
ever
come
in
their
power
to
westminster
where
i
find
the
house
sitting
and
in
a
mighty
heat
about
commissioner
pett
that
they
would
have
him
impeached
though
the
committee
have
yet
brought
in
but
part
of
their
report
and
this
heat
of
the
house
is
much
heightened
by
sir
thomas
clifford
telling
them
that
he
was
the
man
that
did
out
of
his
own
purse
employ
people
at
the
to
prevent
the
king
of
scotts
to
escape
after
the
battle
of
worcester
the
house
was
in
a
great
heat
all
this
day
about
it
and
at
last
it
was
carried
however
that
it
should
be
referred
back
to
the
committee
to
make
further
enquiry
by
and
by
i
met
with
wren
who
tells
me
that
the
duke
of
york
is
in
as
good
condition
as
is
possible
for
a
man
in
his
condition
of
the
pox
he
i
perceive
is
mightily
concerned
in
the
business
of
my
lord
chancellor
the
impeachment
against
whom
is
gone
up
to
the
house
of
lords
and
great
differences
there
are
in
the
house
about
it
and
the
lords
are
very
high
one
against
another
this
day
chichly
told
me
with
a
seeming
trouble
that
the
house
have
stopped
his
son
jack
sir
john
his
going
to
france
that
he
may
be
a
witness
against
my
lord
sandwich
which
do
trouble
me
though
he
can
i
think
say
little
a
conference
between
the
two
houses
today
so
i
stayed
and
it
was
only
to
tell
the
commons
that
the
lords
can
not
agree
to
the
confining
or
sequestring
of
the
earle
of
clarendon
from
the
parliament
forasmuch
as
they
do
not
specify
any
particular
crime
which
they
lay
upon
him
and
call
treason
this
the
house
did
receive
and
so
parted
at
which
i
hear
the
commons
are
like
to
grow
very
high
and
will
insist
upon
their
privileges
and
the
lords
will
own
theirs
though
the
duke
of
buckingham
bristoll
and
others
have
been
very
high
in
the
house
of
lords
to
have
had
him
committed
this
is
likely
to
breed
ill
blood
the
king
hath
as
moore
says
sir
thomas
crewe
told
him
been
heard
to
say
that
the
quarrel
is
not
between
my
lord
chancellor
and
him
but
his
brother
and
him
which
will
make
sad
work
among
us
if
that
be
once
promoted
as
to
be
sure
it
will
buckingham
and
bristoll
being
now
the
only
counsel
the
king
follows
so
as
arlington
and
coventry
are
come
to
signify
little
he
tells
me
they
are
likely
to
fall
upon
my
lord
sandwich
but
for
my
part
sometimes
i
am
apt
to
think
they
can
not
do
him
much
harm
he
telling
me
that
there
is
no
great
fear
of
the
business
of
resumption
this
day
poundy
the
waterman
was
with
me
to
let
me
know
that
he
was
summoned
to
bear
witness
against
me
to
prince
rupert
people
who
have
a
commission
to
look
after
the
business
of
about
the
business
of
the
i
was
concerned
in
but
i
did
desire
him
to
speak
all
he
knew
and
not
to
spare
me
nor
did
promise
nor
give
him
any
thing
but
sent
him
away
with
good
words
met
gregory
my
old
acquaintance
an
understanding
gentleman
and
he
and
i
walked
an
hour
together
talking
of
the
bad
prospect
of
the
times
and
the
sum
of
what
i
learn
from
him
is
this
that
the
king
is
the
most
concerned
in
the
world
against
the
chancellor
and
all
people
that
do
not
appear
against
him
and
therefore
is
angry
with
the
bishops
having
said
that
he
had
one
bishop
on
his
side
crofts
herbert
croft
dean
of
hereford
elected
bishop
of
that
see
and
but
one
that
buckingham
and
bristoll
are
now
his
only
cabinet
counsel
and
that
before
the
duke
of
york
fell
sick
buckingham
was
admitted
to
the
king
of
his
cabinet
and
there
stayed
with
him
several
hours
and
the
duke
of
york
shut
out
that
it
is
plain
that
there
is
dislike
between
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
that
it
is
to
be
feared
that
the
house
will
go
so
far
against
the
chancellor
that
they
must
do
something
to
undo
the
duke
of
york
or
will
not
think
themselves
safe
that
this
lord
vaughan
that
is
so
great
against
the
chancellor
is
one
of
the
lewdest
fellows
of
the
age
worse
than
sir
charles
sedley
and
that
he
was
heard
to
swear
he
would
do
my
lord
clarendon
business
john
lord
vaughan
eldest
surviving
son
to
richard
earl
of
carbery
whom
he
succeeded
he
was
well
versed
in
literature
and
president
of
the
royal
society
from
to
and
had
been
governor
of
jamaica
he
was
amongst
dryden
earliest
patrons
ob
that
he
do
find
that
my
lord
clarendon
hath
more
friends
in
both
houses
than
he
believes
he
would
have
by
reason
that
they
do
see
what
are
the
hands
that
pull
him
down
which
they
do
not
like
that
harry
coventry
was
scolded
at
by
the
king
severely
the
other
day
and
that
his
answer
was
that
if
he
must
not
speak
what
he
thought
in
this
business
in
parliament
he
must
not
come
thither
and
he
says
that
by
this
very
business
harry
coventry
hath
got
more
fame
and
common
esteem
than
any
gentleman
in
england
hath
at
this
day
and
is
an
excellent
and
able
person
that
the
king
who
not
long
ago
did
say
of
bristoll
that
he
was
a
man
able
in
three
years
to
get
himself
a
fortune
in
any
kingdom
in
the
world
and
lose
all
again
in
three
months
do
now
hug
him
and
commend
his
parts
every
where
above
all
the
world
how
fickle
is
this
man
and
how
unhappy
we
like
to
be
that
he
fears
some
furious
courses
will
be
taken
against
the
duke
of
york
and
that
he
hath
heard
that
it
was
designed
if
they
can
not
carry
matters
against
the
chancellor
to
impeach
the
duke
of
york
himself
which
god
forbid
that
sir
edward
nicholas
whom
he
served
while
secretary
is
one
of
the
best
men
in
the
world
but
hated
by
the
for
a
service
he
did
the
old
king
against
her
mind
and
her
favourites
and
that
she
and
my
lady
castlemaine
did
make
the
king
to
lay
him
aside
but
this
man
says
that
he
is
one
of
the
most
heavenly
and
charitable
men
in
the
whole
world
that
the
house
of
commons
resolve
to
stand
by
their
proceedings
and
have
chosen
a
committee
to
draw
up
the
reason
thereof
to
carry
to
the
lords
which
is
likely
to
breed
great
heat
between
them
that
the
parliament
after
all
this
is
likely
to
give
the
king
no
money
and
therefore
that
it
is
to
be
wondered
what
makes
the
king
give
way
to
so
great
extravagancies
which
do
all
tend
to
the
making
him
less
than
he
is
and
so
will
every
day
more
and
more
and
by
this
means
every
creature
is
divided
against
the
other
that
there
never
was
so
great
an
uncertainty
in
england
of
what
would
be
the
event
of
things
as
at
this
day
nobody
being
at
ease
or
safe
to
white
hall
and
there
got
into
the
theatre
room
and
there
heard
both
the
vocall
and
instrumentall
musick
here
was
the
king
and
queene
and
some
of
the
ladies
among
whom
none
more
jolly
than
my
lady
buckingham
her
lord
being
once
more
a
great
man
i
was
told
this
day
that
lory
hide
laurence
hyde
master
of
the
robes
afterwards
created
earl
of
rochester
second
son
of
my
lord
chancellor
did
some
time
since
in
the
house
say
that
if
he
thought
his
father
was
guilty
but
of
one
of
the
things
then
said
against
him
he
would
be
the
first
that
should
call
for
judgement
against
him
which
waller
the
poet
did
say
was
spoke
like
the
old
roman
like
brutus
for
its
greatness
and
worthiness
this
afternoon
mills
told
me
how
fully
satisfactory
my
first
report
was
to
the
house
in
the
business
of
chatham
which
i
am
glad
to
hear
and
the
more
for
that
i
know
that
he
is
a
great
creature
of
sir
brookes
among
other
things
of
news
i
do
hear
that
upon
the
reading
of
the
house
of
commons
reasons
of
the
manner
of
their
proceedings
in
the
business
of
my
lord
chancellor
the
reasons
were
so
bad
that
my
lord
bristoll
himself
did
declare
that
he
would
not
stand
to
what
he
had
and
did
still
advise
the
lords
to
concur
to
upon
any
of
the
reasons
of
the
house
of
commons
but
if
it
was
put
to
the
question
whether
it
should
be
done
on
their
reasons
he
would
be
against
them
and
indeed
it
seems
the
reasons
however
they
come
to
escape
the
house
of
commons
which
shows
how
slightly
the
greatest
matters
are
done
in
this
world
and
even
in
parliaments
were
none
of
them
of
strength
but
the
principle
of
them
untrue
they
saying
that
where
any
man
is
brought
before
a
judge
accused
of
treason
in
general
without
specifying
the
particular
the
judge
is
obliged
to
commit
him
the
question
being
put
by
the
lords
to
my
lord
keeper
he
said
that
quite
the
contrary
was
true
and
then
in
the
sixth
article
i
will
get
a
copy
of
them
if
i
can
there
are
two
or
three
things
strangely
asserted
to
the
diminishing
of
the
king
power
as
is
said
at
least
things
that
heretofore
would
not
have
been
heard
of
but
then
the
question
being
put
among
the
lords
as
my
lord
bristoll
advised
whether
upon
the
whole
matter
and
reasons
that
had
been
laid
before
them
they
would
commit
my
lord
clarendon
it
was
carried
five
to
one
against
it
there
being
but
three
bishops
against
him
of
whom
cosens
john
cosins
master
of
peter
house
and
dean
of
peterborough
in
the
time
of
charles
afterwards
bishop
of
durham
ob
aged
and
reynolds
edward
reynolds
bishop
of
norwich
ob
were
two
and
i
know
not
the
third
this
made
the
opposite
lords
as
bristoll
and
buckingham
so
mad
that
they
declared
and
protested
against
it
speaking
very
broad
that
there
was
mutiny
and
rebellion
in
the
hearts
of
the
lords
and
that
they
desired
they
might
enter
their
dissents
which
they
did
do
in
great
fury
so
that
upon
the
lords
sending
to
the
commons
as
i
am
told
to
have
a
conference
for
them
to
give
their
answer
to
the
reasons
the
commons
did
desire
a
free
conference
but
the
lords
do
deny
it
and
the
reason
is
that
they
hold
not
the
commons
any
court
but
that
themselves
only
are
a
court
and
the
chief
court
of
judicature
and
therefore
are
not
to
dispute
the
laws
and
method
of
their
own
court
with
them
that
are
none
and
so
will
not
submit
so
much
as
to
have
their
power
disputed
and
it
is
conceived
that
much
of
this
eagerness
among
the
lords
do
arise
from
the
fear
some
of
them
have
that
they
may
be
dealt
with
in
the
same
manner
themselves
and
therefore
to
stand
upon
it
now
it
seems
my
lord
clarendon
hath
as
is
said
and
believed
had
his
coach
and
horses
several
times
in
his
coach
ready
to
carry
him
to
the
tower
expecting
a
message
to
that
purpose
but
by
this
means
his
case
is
like
to
be
laid
by
with
creed
to
a
tavern
where
dean
wilkins
and
others
and
good
discourse
among
the
rest
of
a
man
that
is
a
little
frantic
that
hath
been
a
kind
of
minister
wilkins
saying
that
he
hath
read
for
him
in
his
church
that
is
poor
and
a
debauched
man
that
the
college
have
hired
for
to
have
some
of
the
blood
of
a
sheep
let
into
his
body
and
it
is
to
be
done
on
saturday
next
they
purpose
to
let
in
about
twelve
ounces
which
they
compute
is
what
will
be
let
in
in
a
minute
time
by
a
watch
on
this
occasion
whistler
told
a
pretty
story
related
by
muffett
a
good
author
of
cayus
that
built
caius
college
that
being
very
old
and
living
only
at
that
time
upon
woman
milk
he
while
he
fed
upon
the
milk
of
an
angry
fretful
woman
was
so
himself
and
then
being
advised
to
take
it
of
a
patient
woman
he
did
become
so
beyond
the
common
temper
of
his
age
met
with
cooling
my
lord
chamberlain
secretary
and
from
him
learn
the
truth
of
all
i
heard
last
night
and
understand
further
that
this
stiffness
of
the
lords
is
in
no
manner
of
kindness
to
my
lord
chancellor
for
he
neither
hath
nor
do
nor
for
the
future
can
oblige
any
of
them
but
rather
the
contrary
but
that
they
do
fear
what
the
consequence
may
be
to
themselves
should
they
yield
in
his
case
as
many
of
them
have
reason
and
more
he
showed
me
how
this
is
rather
to
the
wrong
and
prejudice
of
my
lord
chancellor
for
that
it
is
better
for
him
to
come
to
be
tried
before
the
lords
where
he
can
have
right
and
make
interest
than
when
the
parliament
is
up
be
committed
by
the
king
and
tried
by
a
court
on
purpose
made
by
the
king
of
what
lords
the
king
pleases
who
have
a
mind
to
have
his
head
so
that
my
lord
cornbury
himself
his
son
he
tells
me
hath
moved
that
if
they
have
treason
against
my
lord
of
clarendon
that
they
would
specify
it
and
send
it
up
to
the
lords
that
he
might
come
to
his
trial
so
full
of
intrigues
this
business
is
walked
a
good
while
in
the
temple
church
observing
the
plainness
of
selden
tomb
and
how
much
better
one
of
his
executors
hath
who
is
buried
by
him
busy
till
late
preparing
things
to
fortify
myself
and
fellows
against
the
parliament
and
particularly
myself
against
what
i
fear
is
thought
that
i
have
suppressed
the
order
of
the
board
by
which
the
discharging
the
great
ships
at
chatham
by
tickets
was
directed
whereas
indeed
there
was
no
such
order
this
morning
sir
pen
tells
me
that
the
house
was
very
hot
on
saturday
last
upon
the
business
of
liberty
of
speech
in
the
house
and
damned
the
vote
in
the
beginning
of
the
parliament
against
it
so
that
he
fears
that
there
may
be
some
bad
thing
which
they
have
a
mind
to
broach
which
they
dare
not
do
without
more
security
than
they
now
have
god
keep
us
for
things
look
mighty
ill
this
evening
comes
to
me
to
my
closet
at
the
office
sir
john
chichly
of
his
own
accord
to
tell
me
what
he
shall
answer
to
the
committee
when
as
he
expects
he
shall
be
examined
about
my
lord
sandwich
which
is
so
little
as
will
not
hurt
my
lord
at
all
i
know
pierce
comes
to
me
and
there
in
general
tells
me
how
the
king
is
now
fallen
in
and
become
a
slave
to
the
duke
of
buckingham
led
by
none
but
him
whom
he
pierce
swears
he
knows
do
hate
the
very
person
of
the
king
and
would
as
well
as
will
certainly
ruin
him
he
do
say
and
i
think
is
right
that
the
king
do
in
this
do
the
most
ungrateful
part
of
a
master
to
a
servant
that
ever
was
done
in
this
carriage
of
his
to
my
lord
chancellor
that
it
may
be
the
chancellor
may
have
faults
but
none
such
as
these
they
speak
of
that
he
do
now
really
fear
that
all
is
going
to
ruin
for
he
says
he
hears
that
sir
coventry
hath
been
just
before
his
sickness
with
the
duke
of
york
to
ask
his
forgiveness
and
peace
for
what
he
had
done
for
that
he
never
could
foresee
that
what
he
meant
so
well
in
the
counselling
to
lay
by
the
chancellor
should
come
to
this
to
arundell
house
to
the
election
of
officers
of
the
royal
society
for
the
next
year
where
i
was
near
being
chosen
of
the
council
but
am
glad
i
was
not
for
i
could
not
have
attended
though
above
all
things
i
could
wish
it
and
do
take
it
as
a
mighty
respect
to
have
been
named
there
then
to
cary
house
a
house
now
of
entertainment
next
my
lord
ashly
where
i
have
heretofore
heard
common
prayer
in
the
time
of
mossum
probably
robert
massum
dean
of
christ
church
dublin
and
in
made
bishop
of
derry
i
was
pleased
to
see
the
person
who
had
his
blood
taken
out
he
speaks
well
and
did
this
day
give
the
society
a
relation
thereof
in
latin
saying
that
he
finds
himself
much
better
since
and
as
a
new
man
but
he
is
cracked
a
little
in
his
head
though
he
speaks
very
reasonably
and
very
well
he
had
but
for
his
suffering
it
and
is
to
have
the
same
again
tried
upon
him
the
first
sound
man
that
ever
had
it
tried
on
him
in
england
and
but
one
that
we
hear
of
in
france
my
lord
anglesy
told
me
this
day
that
he
did
believe
the
house
of
commons
would
the
next
week
yield
to
the
lords
but
speaking
with
others
this
day
they
conclude
they
will
not
but
that
rather
the
king
will
accommodate
it
by
committing
my
lord
clarendon
himself
i
remember
what
evelyn
said
that
he
did
believe
we
should
soon
see
ourselves
fall
into
a
commonwealth
again
december
i
to
church
and
in
our
pew
there
sat
a
great
lady
whom
i
afterwards
understood
to
be
my
lady
carlisle
anne
daughter
of
edward
lord
howard
of
escrick
wife
to
charles
first
earl
of
carlisle
a
very
fine
woman
indeed
in
person
the
lords
answer
is
come
down
to
the
commons
that
they
are
not
satisfied
in
the
commons
reasons
and
so
the
commons
are
hot
and
like
to
sit
all
day
upon
the
business
what
to
do
herein
most
thinking
that
they
will
remonstrate
against
the
lords
thence
to
lord
crewe
and
there
dined
with
him
where
after
dinner
he
took
me
aside
and
bewailed
the
condition
of
the
nation
now
the
king
and
his
brother
are
at
a
distance
about
this
business
of
the
chancellor
and
the
two
houses
differing
and
he
do
believe
that
there
are
so
many
about
the
king
like
to
be
concerned
and
troubled
by
the
parliament
that
they
will
get
him
to
dissolve
or
prorogue
the
parliament
and
the
rather
for
that
the
king
is
likely
by
this
good
husbandry
of
the
treasury
to
get
out
of
debt
and
the
parliament
is
likely
to
give
no
money
among
other
things
my
lord
crewe
did
tell
me
with
grief
that
he
hears
that
the
king
of
late
hath
not
dined
nor
supped
with
the
queene
as
he
used
of
late
to
do
to
westminster
hall
where
my
cosen
roger
tells
me
of
the
high
vote
of
the
commons
this
afternoon
that
the
proceedings
of
the
lords
in
the
case
of
my
lord
clarendon
are
an
obstruction
to
justice
and
of
ill
precedent
to
future
times
to
sir
coventry
the
first
time
i
have
seen
him
at
his
new
house
since
he
came
to
lodge
there
he
tells
me
of
the
vote
for
none
of
the
house
to
be
of
the
commission
for
the
bill
of
accounts
which
he
thinks
is
so
great
a
disappointment
to
birch
and
others
that
expected
to
be
of
it
that
he
thinks
could
it
have
been
seen
there
would
not
have
been
any
bill
at
all
we
hope
it
will
be
the
better
for
all
that
are
to
account
it
being
likely
that
the
men
being
few
and
not
of
the
house
will
hear
reason
the
main
business
i
went
about
was
about
gilsthrop
sir
batten
clerk
who
being
upon
his
and
now
dead
hath
offered
to
make
discoveries
of
the
disorders
of
the
navy
and
of
damage
to
the
king
which
made
mighty
note
in
the
commons
house
and
members
appointed
to
go
to
him
which
they
did
but
nothing
to
the
purpose
got
from
him
but
complaints
of
false
musters
and
ships
being
refitted
with
victuals
and
stores
at
plymouth
after
they
were
fitted
from
other
ports
but
all
this
to
no
purpose
nor
more
than
we
know
and
will
owne
but
the
best
is
that
this
should
say
this
that
understands
nothing
of
the
navy
nor
ever
would
and
hath
particularly
blemished
his
master
by
name
among
us
i
told
sir
coventry
of
my
letter
to
sir
brookes
and
his
answer
to
me
he
advises
me
in
what
i
write
to
him
to
be
as
short
as
i
can
and
obscure
saving
in
things
fully
plain
for
that
all
that
he
do
is
to
make
mischief
and
that
the
greatest
wisdom
in
dealing
with
the
parliament
in
the
world
is
to
say
little
and
let
them
get
out
what
they
can
by
force
which
i
shall
observe
he
declared
to
me
much
of
his
mind
to
be
ruled
by
his
own
measures
and
not
to
go
so
far
as
many
would
have
him
to
the
ruin
of
my
lord
chancellor
and
for
which
they
do
endeavour
to
do
what
they
can
against
sir
coventry
but
says
he
i
have
done
my
do
in
helping
to
get
him
out
of
the
administration
of
things
for
which
he
is
not
fit
but
for
his
life
or
estate
i
will
have
nothing
to
say
to
it
besides
that
my
duty
to
my
master
the
duke
of
york
is
such
that
i
will
perish
before
i
will
do
any
thing
to
displease
or
disoblige
him
where
the
very
necessity
of
the
kingdom
do
not
in
my
judgment
call
me
home
and
there
met
batelier
who
tells
me
the
first
great
news
that
my
lord
chancellor
is
fled
this
day
and
left
a
paper
behind
him
for
the
house
of
lords
telling
them
the
reason
of
his
retiring
complaining
of
a
design
for
his
ruin
but
the
paper
i
must
get
only
the
thing
at
present
is
great
and
will
put
the
king
and
commons
to
some
new
counsels
certainly
sir
richard
ford
told
us
this
evening
an
odd
story
of
the
basenesse
of
the
lord
mayor
sir
bolton
in
cheating
the
poor
of
the
city
out
of
the
collections
made
for
the
people
that
were
burned
of
of
which
he
can
give
no
account
and
in
which
he
hath
forsworn
himself
plainly
so
as
the
court
of
aldermen
have
sequestered
him
from
their
court
till
he
do
bring
in
an
account
he
says
also
that
this
day
hath
been
made
appear
to
them
that
the
keeper
of
newgate
hath
at
this
day
made
his
house
the
only
nursery
of
rogues
prostitutes
pickpockets
and
thieves
in
the
world
where
they
were
bred
and
entertained
and
the
whole
society
met
and
that
for
the
sake
of
the
sheriffes
they
durst
not
this
day
commit
him
for
fear
of
making
him
let
out
the
prisoners
but
are
fain
to
go
by
artifice
to
deal
with
him
he
tells
me
also
speaking
of
the
new
street
that
is
to
be
made
from
guild
hall
down
to
cheapside
that
the
ground
is
already
most
of
it
bought
and
tells
me
of
one
particular
of
a
man
that
hath
a
piece
of
ground
lying
in
the
very
middle
of
the
street
that
must
be
which
when
the
street
is
cut
out
of
it
there
will
remain
ground
enough
of
each
side
to
build
a
house
to
front
the
street
he
demanded
for
the
ground
and
to
be
excused
paying
any
thing
for
the
melioration
of
the
rest
of
his
ground
that
he
was
to
keep
the
court
consented
to
give
him
only
not
to
abate
him
the
consideration
which
the
man
denied
but
told
them
and
so
they
agreed
that
he
would
excuse
the
city
the
that
he
might
have
the
benefit
of
the
melioration
without
paying
any
thing
for
it
so
much
some
will
get
by
having
the
city
burned
ground
by
this
means
that
was
not
worth
before
will
now
when
houses
are
built
be
worth
but
he
tells
me
of
the
common
standard
now
reckoned
on
between
man
and
man
in
places
where
there
is
no
alteration
of
circumstances
but
only
the
houses
burnt
there
the
ground
which
with
a
house
on
it
did
yield
a
year
is
now
reputed
worth
and
that
this
is
the
common
between
one
man
and
another
made
upon
a
good
and
moderate
medium
i
hear
that
the
house
of
lords
did
send
down
the
paper
which
my
lord
clarendon
left
behind
him
directed
to
the
lords
to
be
seditious
and
scandalous
and
the
commons
have
voted
that
it
be
burned
by
the
hands
of
the
hangman
and
that
the
king
be
desired
to
agree
to
it
i
do
hear
also
that
they
have
desired
the
king
to
use
means
to
stop
his
escape
out
of
the
nation
this
day
gilsthrop
is
buried
who
hath
made
all
the
late
discourse
of
the
great
discovery
of
of
which
the
king
hath
been
wronged
with
sir
minnes
to
the
duke
of
york
the
first
time
that
i
have
seen
him
or
we
waited
on
him
since
his
sickness
and
blessed
be
god
he
is
not
at
all
the
worse
for
the
but
is
only
a
little
weak
yet
we
did
much
business
with
him
and
so
parted
my
lord
anglesy
told
me
how
my
lord
northampton
james
third
earl
of
northampton
lord
lieutenant
of
warwickshire
and
constable
of
the
tower
ob
brought
in
a
bill
into
the
house
of
lords
yesterday
under
the
name
of
a
bill
for
the
honour
and
privilege
of
the
house
and
mercy
to
my
lord
clarendon
which
he
told
me
he
opposed
saying
that
he
was
a
man
accused
of
treason
by
the
house
of
commons
and
mercy
was
not
proper
for
him
having
not
been
tried
yet
and
so
no
mercy
needful
for
him
however
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
others
did
desire
that
the
bill
might
be
read
and
it
was
for
banishing
my
lord
clarendon
from
all
his
majesty
dominions
and
that
it
should
be
treason
to
have
him
found
in
any
of
them
the
thing
is
only
a
thing
of
vanity
and
to
insult
over
him
by
and
by
home
with
sir
minnes
who
tells
me
that
my
lord
clarendon
did
go
away
in
a
boat
and
is
now
at
callis
and
i
confess
nothing
seems
to
hang
more
heavy
than
his
leaving
of
this
unfortunate
paper
behind
him
that
hath
angered
both
houses
and
hath
i
think
reconciled
them
in
that
which
otherwise
would
have
broke
them
in
pieces
so
that
i
do
hence
and
from
sir
late
example
and
doctrine
to
me
learn
that
on
these
sorts
of
occasions
there
is
nothing
like
silence
it
being
seldom
any
wrong
to
a
man
to
say
nothing
but
for
the
most
part
it
is
to
say
any
thing
sir
minnes
told
me
a
story
of
lord
cottington
who
wanting
a
son
intended
to
make
his
nephew
his
heir
a
country
boy
but
did
alter
his
mind
upon
the
boy
being
persuaded
by
another
young
heir
in
roguery
to
crow
like
a
cock
at
my
lord
table
much
company
being
there
and
the
boy
having
a
great
trick
at
doing
that
perfectly
my
lord
bade
them
take
away
that
fool
from
the
table
and
so
gave
over
the
thoughts
of
making
him
his
heir
from
this
piece
of
folly
captain
cocke
comes
to
me
and
among
other
discourse
tells
me
that
he
is
told
that
an
impeachment
against
sir
coventry
will
be
brought
in
very
soon
he
tells
me
that
even
those
that
are
against
my
lord
chancellor
and
the
court
in
the
house
do
not
trust
nor
agree
one
with
another
he
tells
me
that
my
lord
chancellor
went
away
about
ten
at
night
on
saturday
last
at
westminster
and
took
boat
at
westminster
and
thence
by
a
vessel
to
callis
where
he
believes
he
now
is
and
that
the
duke
of
york
and
wren
knew
of
it
and
that
himself
did
know
of
it
on
sunday
morning
that
on
sunday
his
coach
and
people
about
it
went
to
twittenham
and
the
world
thought
that
he
had
been
there
that
nothing
but
this
unhappy
paper
hath
undone
him
and
that
he
doubts
that
this
paper
hath
lost
him
every
where
that
his
withdrawing
do
reconcile
things
so
far
as
he
thinks
the
heat
of
their
fury
will
be
over
and
that
all
will
be
made
well
between
the
two
brothers
that
holland
do
endeavour
to
persuade
the
king
of
france
to
break
peace
with
us
that
the
dutch
will
without
doubt
have
sixty
sail
of
ships
out
the
next
year
so
knows
not
what
will
become
of
us
but
hopes
the
parliament
will
find
money
for
us
to
have
a
fleet
somebody
told
me
this
day
that
they
hear
that
thomson
with
the
wooden
leg
and
wildman
the
man
a
great
creature
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
are
in
nomination
to
be
commissioners
among
others
upon
the
bill
of
accounts
to
white
hall
where
i
saw
the
duchesse
of
york
in
a
fine
dress
of
second
mourning
for
her
mother
being
black
edged
with
ermin
go
to
make
her
first
visit
to
the
queene
since
the
duke
of
york
being
sick
and
by
and
by
she
being
returned
the
queene
came
and
visited
her
but
it
was
pretty
to
observe
that
sir
coventry
and
i
walking
an
hour
and
more
together
in
the
matted
gallery
he
observed
and
so
did
i
how
the
duchesse
soon
as
she
spied
him
turned
her
head
a
one
side
here
he
and
i
walked
thus
long
which
we
have
not
done
a
great
while
before
our
discourse
was
upon
every
thing
the
unhappiness
of
having
our
matters
examined
by
people
that
understand
them
not
that
it
is
better
for
us
in
the
navy
to
have
men
that
do
understand
the
whole
and
that
are
not
passionate
that
we
that
have
taken
the
most
pains
are
called
upon
to
answer
for
all
crimes
while
those
that
like
sir
batten
and
sir
minnes
did
sit
and
do
nothing
do
lie
still
without
any
trouble
that
if
it
were
to
serve
the
king
and
kingdom
again
in
a
war
neither
of
us
could
do
more
though
upon
this
experience
we
might
do
better
than
we
did
that
the
commanders
the
gentlemen
that
could
never
be
brought
to
order
but
undid
all
are
now
the
men
that
find
fault
and
abuse
others
that
it
had
been
much
better
for
the
king
to
have
given
sir
minnes
and
sir
batten
to
have
sat
still
than
to
have
had
them
in
this
business
this
war
that
the
serving
a
prince
that
minds
not
his
business
is
most
unhappy
for
them
that
serve
him
well
and
an
unhappiness
so
great
that
he
declares
he
will
never
have
more
to
do
with
a
war
under
him
that
he
hath
papers
which
do
flatly
contradict
the
duke
of
albemarle
narrative
and
that
he
hath
been
with
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
showed
him
them
to
prevent
his
falling
into
another
like
fault
that
the
duke
of
albemarle
seems
to
be
able
to
answer
them
but
he
thinks
that
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
the
prince
are
contented
to
let
their
narratives
sleep
they
being
not
only
contradictory
in
some
things
as
he
observed
about
the
business
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
being
to
follow
the
prince
upon
the
dividing
the
fleet
in
case
the
enemy
come
out
but
neither
of
them
to
be
maintained
in
others
that
the
business
the
other
night
of
my
lord
anglesy
at
the
council
was
happily
got
over
for
my
lord
by
his
dexterous
silencing
it
and
the
rest
not
urging
it
further
forasmuch
as
had
the
duke
of
buckingham
come
in
time
enough
and
had
got
it
by
the
end
he
would
have
touched
him
in
it
sir
coventry
telling
me
that
my
lord
anglesy
did
with
such
impudence
maintain
the
quarrel
against
the
commons
and
some
of
the
lords
in
the
business
of
my
lord
clarendon
that
he
believes
there
are
enough
would
be
glad
but
of
this
occasion
to
be
revenged
of
him
he
tells
me
that
he
hears
some
of
the
thomsons
are
like
to
be
of
the
commission
for
the
accounts
and
wildman
which
he
much
wonders
at
as
having
been
a
false
fellow
to
every
body
and
in
prison
most
of
the
time
since
the
coming
in
but
he
do
tell
me
that
the
house
is
in
such
a
condition
that
nobody
can
tell
what
to
make
of
them
and
he
thinks
they
were
never
in
before
that
every
body
leads
and
nobody
follows
and
that
he
do
now
think
that
since
a
great
many
are
defeated
in
their
expectation
of
being
of
the
commission
now
they
would
put
it
into
such
hands
as
it
shall
get
no
credit
from
for
if
they
do
look
to
the
bottom
and
see
the
king
case
they
think
they
are
then
bound
to
give
the
king
money
whereas
they
would
be
excused
from
that
and
therefore
endeavour
to
make
this
business
of
the
accounts
to
signify
little
comes
captain
cocke
to
me
and
there
he
tells
me
to
my
great
satisfaction
that
sir
robert
brookes
did
dine
with
him
and
that
he
told
him
speaking
of
me
that
he
would
make
me
the
darling
of
the
house
of
commons
so
much
he
is
satisfied
concerning
me
and
this
cocke
did
tell
me
that
i
might
give
him
thanks
for
it
and
i
do
think
it
may
do
me
good
for
he
do
happen
to
be
held
a
considerable
person
of
a
young
man
both
for
sobriety
and
ability
comes
sir
carteret
to
talk
with
me
who
seems
to
think
himself
safe
as
to
his
particular
but
do
doubt
what
will
become
of
the
whole
kingdom
things
being
so
broke
in
pieces
he
tells
me
that
the
king
himself
did
the
other
day
very
particularly
tell
the
whole
story
of
my
lord
sandwich
not
following
the
dutch
ships
with
which
he
is
charged
and
shows
the
reasons
of
it
to
be
the
only
good
course
he
could
have
taken
and
do
discourse
it
very
knowingly
this
i
am
glad
of
though
as
the
king
is
now
his
favour
for
aught
i
see
serves
very
little
in
stead
at
this
day
but
rather
is
an
argument
against
a
man
and
the
king
do
not
concern
himself
to
relieve
or
justify
any
body
but
is
wholly
negligent
of
every
body
concernment
the
king
did
send
a
message
to
the
house
that
he
would
adjourn
them
on
the
instant
to
february
by
which
time
at
least
i
shall
have
more
respite
to
prepare
things
on
my
own
behalf
and
the
office
against
their
return
i
met
harris
the
player
and
talked
of
catiline
which
is
to
be
suddenly
acted
at
the
king
house
and
there
all
agree
that
it
can
not
be
well
done
at
that
house
there
not
being
good
actors
enough
and
burt
davies
says
burt
ranked
in
the
list
of
good
actors
without
possessing
superior
dramatic
miscellanies
acts
cicero
which
they
all
conclude
he
will
not
be
able
to
do
well
the
king
gives
them
for
robes
there
being
as
they
say
to
be
sixteen
scarlet
robes
comes
sir
warren
i
have
been
recently
informed
that
charles
april
knighted
a
rich
tradesman
of
wapping
named
william
warren
and
there
is
still
in
that
parish
a
place
called
sir
william
warren
square
perhaps
built
on
the
site
of
the
residence
to
talk
about
some
business
of
his
and
mine
and
he
i
find
would
have
me
not
to
think
that
the
parliament
in
the
mind
they
are
in
and
having
so
many
good
offices
in
their
view
to
dispose
of
will
leave
any
of
the
king
officers
in
but
will
rout
all
though
i
am
likely
to
escape
as
well
as
any
if
any
can
escape
and
i
think
he
is
in
the
right
and
i
do
look
for
it
accordingly
my
bookseller
did
give
me
a
list
of
the
twenty
who
were
mentioned
for
the
commission
in
parliament
for
the
accounts
and
it
is
strange
that
of
the
twenty
the
parliament
could
not
think
fit
to
choose
their
nine
but
were
fain
to
add
three
that
were
not
in
the
list
of
the
twenty
they
being
many
of
them
factious
people
and
ringleaders
in
the
late
troubles
so
that
sir
john
talbot
did
fly
out
and
was
very
hot
in
the
business
of
being
named
and
took
notice
how
he
was
entertained
in
the
bosom
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
a
and
that
it
was
fit
to
be
observed
by
the
house
and
punished
the
men
that
i
know
of
the
nine
i
like
very
well
that
is
pierrepoint
lord
brereton
william
third
lord
brereton
of
leaghlin
in
ireland
for
cheshire
where
he
possessed
an
estate
which
he
disposed
of
on
account
of
the
exigences
of
the
times
and
his
losses
in
the
cause
of
charles
i
he
was
educated
at
breda
and
was
an
accomplished
and
amiable
nobleman
and
one
of
the
founders
of
the
royal
society
ob
and
sir
william
turner
and
i
do
think
the
rest
are
so
too
but
such
as
will
not
be
able
to
do
this
business
as
it
ought
to
be
to
do
any
good
with
here
i
did
also
see
their
votes
against
my
lord
chief
justice
keeling
that
his
proceedings
were
illegal
and
that
he
was
a
contemner
of
magna
charta
the
great
preserver
of
our
lives
freedoms
and
properties
and
an
introduction
to
arbitrary
government
which
is
very
high
language
and
of
the
same
sound
with
that
in
the
year
this
day
my
lord
chancellor
letter
was
burned
at
the
to
westminster
to
the
to
speak
with
roger
and
here
i
saw
my
lord
keeling
go
into
the
house
to
the
bar
to
have
his
business
heard
by
the
whole
house
and
a
great
crowd
of
people
to
stare
upon
him
here
i
hear
that
the
lord
bill
for
banishing
and
disabling
my
lord
clarendon
from
bearing
any
office
or
being
in
the
king
dominions
and
it
being
made
felony
for
any
to
correspond
with
him
but
his
own
children
is
brought
to
the
commons
but
they
will
not
agree
to
it
being
not
satisfied
with
that
as
sufficient
but
will
have
a
bill
of
attainder
brought
in
against
him
but
they
make
use
of
this
against
the
lords
that
they
that
would
not
think
there
was
cause
enough
to
commit
him
without
hearing
will
have
him
banished
without
hearing
by
and
by
comes
out
my
cosen
roger
to
me
he
being
not
willing
to
be
in
the
house
at
the
business
of
my
lord
keeling
lest
he
should
be
called
upon
to
complain
against
him
for
his
abusing
him
at
cambridge
among
other
news
it
is
now
fresh
that
the
king
of
portugall
is
deposed
and
his
brother
made
king
and
that
my
lord
sandwich
is
gone
from
madrid
with
great
honour
to
lisbon
to
make
up
at
this
juncture
a
peace
to
the
advantage
as
the
spaniard
would
have
it
of
spain
i
wish
it
may
be
for
my
lord
honour
if
it
be
so
but
it
seems
my
lord
is
in
mighty
estimation
in
spain
with
my
cosen
roger
to
westminster
hall
and
there
we
met
the
house
rising
and
they
have
voted
my
lord
chief
justice
keeling
proceedings
illegal
but
that
out
of
particular
respect
to
him
and
the
mediation
of
a
great
many
they
have
resolved
to
proceed
no
further
against
him
to
westminster
where
i
find
the
house
mighty
busy
upon
a
petition
against
my
lord
gerard
which
lays
heavy
things
to
his
charge
of
his
abusing
the
king
in
his
guards
and
very
hot
the
house
is
upon
it
this
day
i
do
hear
at
white
hall
that
the
duke
of
monmouth
is
sick
and
in
danger
of
the
to
the
office
where
commissioner
middleton
first
took
his
place
at
the
board
as
surveyor
of
the
navy
and
indeed
i
think
will
be
an
excellent
officer
i
am
sure
much
beyond
what
his
predecessor
was
this
evening
the
king
by
message
which
he
never
did
before
hath
passed
several
bills
among
others
that
for
the
accounts
and
for
banishing
my
lord
chancellor
and
hath
adjourned
the
house
to
february
at
which
i
am
glad
hoping
in
this
time
to
get
leisure
to
state
my
tangier
accounts
and
to
prepare
better
for
the
parliament
enquiries
here
i
hear
how
the
house
of
lords
with
great
severity
if
not
tyranny
have
proceeded
against
poor
carr
who
only
erred
in
the
manner
of
the
presenting
his
petition
against
my
lord
gerard
it
being
first
printed
before
it
was
presented
which
was
it
seems
by
colonell
sands
going
into
the
country
into
whose
hands
he
had
put
it
the
poor
man
is
ordered
to
stand
in
the
pillory
two
or
three
times
and
to
have
his
eares
cut
and
be
imprisoned
i
know
not
how
long
but
it
is
believed
that
the
commons
when
they
meet
will
not
be
well
pleased
with
it
and
they
have
no
reason
i
think
the
nonconformists
are
mighty
high
and
their
meetings
frequented
and
connived
at
and
they
do
expect
to
have
their
day
now
soon
for
my
lord
of
buckingham
is
a
declared
friend
to
them
and
even
to
the
quakers
who
had
very
good
words
the
other
day
from
the
king
himself
and
what
is
more
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
gilbert
sheldon
is
called
no
more
to
the
caball
nor
by
the
way
sir
coventry
which
i
am
sorry
for
the
caball
at
present
being
as
he
says
the
king
and
duke
of
buckingham
and
lord
keeper
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
privy
seale
the
bishops
differing
from
the
king
in
the
late
business
in
the
house
of
lords
have
caused
this
and
what
is
like
to
follow
for
every
body
is
encouraged
to
speak
and
even
to
preach
as
i
have
heard
one
of
them
as
bad
things
against
them
as
ever
in
the
year
which
is
a
strange
change
i
to
the
exchange
and
there
i
saw
carr
stand
in
the
pillory
for
the
business
of
my
lord
gerard
and
there
hear
by
creed
that
the
bishops
of
winchester
george
morley
and
of
rochester
john
dolben
and
the
dean
of
the
chapel
and
some
other
great
prelates
are
suspended
and
a
cloud
upon
the
archbishop
ever
since
the
late
business
in
the
house
of
lords
and
i
believe
it
will
be
a
heavy
blow
to
the
clergy
by
coach
to
james
it
being
about
six
at
night
my
design
being
to
see
the
ceremonys
this
night
being
the
eve
of
christmas
at
the
queene
chapel
i
got
in
almost
up
to
the
rail
and
with
a
good
deal
of
patience
staid
from
nine
at
night
to
two
in
the
morning
in
a
very
great
crowd
and
there
expected
but
found
nothing
extraordinary
there
being
nothing
but
a
high
masse
the
queene
was
there
and
some
all
being
done
i
was
sorry
for
my
coming
and
missing
of
what
i
expected
which
was
to
have
had
a
child
born
and
dressed
there
and
a
great
deal
of
do
but
we
broke
up
and
nothing
like
it
done
and
there
i
left
people
receiving
the
sacrament
and
the
queene
gone
and
ladies
only
my
lady
castlemaine
who
looked
prettily
in
her
and
so
took
my
coach
which
waited
and
drank
some
burnt
wine
at
the
rose
tavern
door
while
the
constables
came
and
two
or
three
bellmen
went
by
it
being
a
fine
light
moonshine
morning
and
so
home
round
the
city
with
my
wife
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
surprizall
a
comedy
by
sir
robert
howard
which
did
not
please
me
the
actors
not
pleasing
me
and
especially
nell
acting
of
a
serious
part
which
she
spoils
i
hear
this
day
that
stewart
do
at
this
day
keep
a
great
court
at
somerset
house
with
her
husband
the
duke
of
richmond
she
being
visited
for
her
beauty
sake
by
people
as
the
queene
is
at
nights
and
they
say
also
that
she
is
likely
to
go
to
court
again
and
there
put
my
lady
castlemaine
nose
out
of
joynt
a
committee
of
tangier
met
the
duke
of
york
there
and
there
i
did
discourse
over
to
them
their
condition
as
to
money
which
they
were
all
mightily
as
i
could
desire
satisfied
with
but
the
duke
of
albemarle
who
takes
the
part
of
the
guards
against
us
in
our
supplies
of
money
which
is
an
odd
consideration
for
a
dull
heavy
blockhead
as
he
is
understanding
no
more
of
either
than
a
goose
but
the
ability
and
integrity
of
sir
coventry
in
all
the
king
concernments
i
do
and
must
admire
after
the
committee
sir
coventry
tells
me
that
the
businesse
of
getting
the
duchesse
of
richmond
to
court
is
broke
off
the
duke
not
suffering
it
and
thereby
great
trouble
is
brought
among
the
people
that
endeavoured
it
and
thought
they
had
compassed
it
but
lord
to
think
that
at
this
time
the
king
should
mind
no
other
cares
but
these
we
tells
me
that
my
lord
of
canterbury
is
a
mighty
stout
man
and
a
man
of
a
brave
high
spirit
and
cares
not
for
this
disfavour
that
he
is
under
at
court
knowing
that
the
king
can
not
take
away
his
profits
during
his
life
and
therefore
do
not
value
it
to
the
king
house
and
there
saw
the
mad
couple
which
is
but
an
ordinary
play
but
only
nell
and
hart
mad
parts
are
most
excellent
done
but
especially
her
which
makes
it
a
miracle
to
me
to
think
how
ill
she
do
any
serious
part
as
the
other
day
just
like
a
fool
or
changeling
and
in
a
mad
part
do
beyond
all
imitation
almost
it
pleased
us
mightily
to
see
the
natural
affection
of
a
poor
woman
the
mother
of
one
of
the
children
brought
on
the
stage
the
child
crying
she
by
force
got
upon
the
stage
and
took
up
her
child
and
carried
it
away
off
of
the
stage
from
hart
many
fine
faces
here
i
am
told
day
which
troubles
me
that
great
complaint
is
made
upon
the
among
our
merchants
that
the
very
ostend
little
pickaroon
do
offer
violence
to
our
and
search
them
beat
our
masters
and
plunder
them
upon
pretence
of
carrying
frenchmen
goods
at
night
comes
turner
to
see
us
and
there
among
other
talk
she
tells
me
that
william
pen
who
is
lately
come
over
from
ireland
is
a
quaker
again
or
some
very
melancholy
thing
that
he
cares
for
no
company
nor
comes
into
any
which
is
a
pleasant
thing
after
his
being
abroad
so
long
and
his
father
such
a
hypocritical
rogue
and
at
this
time
an
atheist
sir
carteret
and
i
alone
did
talk
of
the
ruinous
condition
we
are
in
the
king
being
going
to
put
out
of
the
council
so
many
able
men
such
as
my
lord
anglesy
ashly
hollis
secretary
morrice
to
bring
in
trevor
john
trevor
knighted
by
charles
ii
who
made
him
secretary
of
state
which
office
he
held
till
his
death
in
and
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
and
my
lord
bridgewater
he
tells
me
that
this
is
true
only
the
duke
of
york
do
endeavour
to
hinder
it
and
the
duke
of
york
himself
did
tell
him
so
that
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
do
not
in
company
disagree
but
are
friendly
but
that
there
is
a
core
in
their
hearts
he
doubts
which
is
not
to
be
easily
removed
for
these
men
so
suffer
only
for
their
constancy
to
the
chancellor
or
at
least
from
the
king
against
him
he
do
suggest
that
something
is
intended
for
the
duke
of
monmouth
and
it
may
be
against
the
queene
also
that
we
are
in
no
manner
sure
against
an
invasion
the
next
year
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
do
rule
all
now
and
the
duke
of
york
comes
indeed
to
the
caball
but
signifies
little
there
that
this
new
faction
do
not
endure
nor
the
king
sir
coventry
but
yet
that
he
is
so
usefull
that
they
can
not
be
without
him
but
that
he
is
not
now
called
to
the
caball
that
my
lord
of
buckingham
bristoll
and
arlington
do
seem
to
agree
in
these
things
but
that
they
do
not
in
their
hearts
trust
one
another
but
do
drive
several
ways
all
of
them
in
short
he
do
bless
himself
that
he
is
no
more
concerned
in
matters
now
and
the
hopes
he
hath
of
being
at
liberty
when
his
accounts
are
over
to
retire
into
the
country
that
he
do
give
over
the
kingdom
for
wholly
lost
this
day
i
got
a
little
rent
in
my
new
fine
camlett
cloak
with
the
latch
of
sir
carteret
door
but
it
is
darned
up
at
my
tailor
that
it
will
be
no
great
blemish
to
it
but
it
troubled
me
i
could
not
but
observe
that
sir
philip
carteret
sir
carteret
eldest
son
mentioned
before
who
had
been
knighted
would
fain
have
given
me
my
going
into
a
play
but
yet
when
he
came
to
the
door
he
had
no
money
to
pay
for
himself
i
having
refused
to
accept
of
it
for
myself
but
was
fain
and
i
perceive
he
is
known
there
and
do
run
upon
the
score
for
plays
which
is
a
shame
but
i
perceive
always
he
is
in
want
of
money
in
the
pit
i
met
with
sir
ch
north
formerly
north
who
was
with
my
lord
at
sea
and
he
of
his
own
accord
was
so
silly
as
to
tell
me
he
is
married
and
for
her
quality
being
a
lord
daughter
catherine
daughter
to
william
lord
grey
of
warke
and
widow
of
sir
edward
moseley
my
lord
grey
and
person
and
beauty
and
years
and
estate
and
disposition
he
is
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
i
am
sure
he
is
an
ugly
fellow
but
a
good
scholar
and
sober
gentleman
and
heir
to
his
father
now
lord
north
the
old
lord
being
dead
thus
ends
the
year
with
great
happiness
to
myself
and
family
as
to
health
and
good
condition
in
the
world
blessed
be
god
for
it
only
with
great
trouble
to
my
mind
in
reference
to
the
publick
there
being
little
hopes
left
but
that
the
whole
nation
must
in
a
very
little
time
be
lost
either
by
troubles
at
home
the
parliament
being
dissatisfied
and
the
king
led
into
unsettled
councils
by
some
about
him
himself
considering
little
and
divisions
growing
between
the
king
and
duke
of
york
or
else
by
foreign
invasion
to
which
we
must
submit
if
any
at
this
bad
point
of
time
should
come
upon
us
which
the
king
of
france
is
well
able
to
do
these
thoughts
and
some
cares
upon
me
concerning
my
standing
in
this
office
when
the
committee
of
parliament
shall
come
to
examine
our
navy
matters
which
they
will
now
shortly
do
i
pray
god
they
may
do
the
kingdom
service
therein
as
they
will
have
sufficient
opportunity
of
doing
it
january
dined
with
my
lord
crewe
with
whom
was
browne
clerk
of
the
house
of
lords
and
john
crewe
here
was
mighty
good
discourse
as
there
is
always
and
among
other
things
my
lord
crewe
did
turn
to
a
place
in
the
life
of
sir
philip
sidney
wrote
by
sir
fulke
greville
which
do
foretell
the
present
condition
of
this
nation
in
relation
to
the
dutch
to
the
very
degree
of
a
prophecy
and
is
so
remarkable
that
i
am
resolved
to
buy
one
of
them
it
being
quite
through
a
good
discourse
here
they
did
talk
much
of
the
present
cheapness
of
corne
even
to
a
miracle
so
as
their
farmers
can
pay
no
rent
but
do
fling
up
their
lands
and
would
pay
in
corne
but
which
i
did
observe
to
my
lord
and
he
liked
well
of
it
our
gentry
are
grown
so
ignorant
in
every
thing
of
good
husbandry
that
they
know
not
how
to
bestow
this
corne
which
did
they
understand
but
a
little
trade
they
would
be
able
to
joyne
together
and
know
what
markets
there
are
abroad
and
send
it
thither
and
thereby
ease
their
tenants
and
be
able
to
pay
themselves
they
did
talk
much
of
the
disgrace
the
archbishop
is
fallen
under
with
the
king
and
the
rest
of
the
bishops
also
thence
i
after
dinner
to
the
duke
of
york
playhouse
and
there
saw
sir
martin
which
i
have
seen
so
often
and
yet
am
mightily
pleased
with
it
and
think
it
mighty
witty
and
the
fullest
of
proper
matter
for
mirth
that
ever
was
writ
and
i
do
clearly
see
that
they
do
improve
in
their
acting
of
it
here
a
mighty
company
of
citizens
prentices
and
others
and
it
makes
me
observe
that
when
i
began
first
to
be
able
to
bestow
a
play
on
myself
i
do
not
remember
that
i
saw
so
many
by
half
of
the
ordinary
prentices
and
mean
people
in
the
pit
at
as
now
i
going
for
several
years
no
higher
than
the
and
then
the
places
though
i
strained
hard
to
go
in
then
when
i
did
so
much
the
vanity
and
prodigality
of
the
age
is
to
be
observed
in
this
particular
thence
i
to
white
hall
and
there
walked
up
and
down
the
house
a
while
and
do
hear
nothing
of
any
thing
done
further
in
this
business
of
the
change
of
only
i
hear
that
sir
savile
of
rufford
notts
bart
created
lord
savile
of
eland
and
viscount
halifax
earl
of
halifax
and
marquis
of
halifax
ob
one
of
the
parliament
committee
of
nine
for
examining
the
accounts
is
by
the
king
made
a
lord
the
lord
halifax
which
i
believe
will
displease
the
parliament
by
and
by
i
met
with
brisband
and
having
it
in
my
mind
this
christmas
to
do
what
i
never
can
remember
that
i
did
go
to
see
the
gaming
at
the
i
having
in
my
coming
from
the
playhouse
stepped
into
the
two
and
there
saw
the
dirty
prentices
and
idle
people
playing
wherein
i
was
mistaken
in
thinking
to
have
seen
gentlemen
of
quality
playing
there
he
did
lead
me
thither
where
after
staying
an
hour
they
began
to
play
at
about
eight
at
night
and
to
see
the
formality
of
the
who
is
their
judge
of
all
disputes
in
play
and
all
quarrels
that
may
arise
therein
and
how
his
are
there
to
observe
true
play
at
each
table
and
to
give
new
dice
is
a
consideration
i
never
could
have
thought
had
been
in
the
world
had
i
not
now
seen
it
and
so
i
having
enough
for
once
refusing
to
venture
though
brisband
pressed
me
hard
went
away
attended
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
in
the
duke
of
york
lodgings
with
the
rest
of
the
officers
and
many
of
the
commanders
of
the
fleet
and
some
of
our
master
shipwrights
to
discourse
the
business
of
having
the
topmasts
of
ships
made
to
lower
abaft
of
the
mainmast
a
business
i
understand
not
and
so
can
give
no
good
account
but
i
do
see
that
by
how
much
greater
the
council
and
the
number
of
counsellors
is
the
more
confused
the
issue
is
of
their
councils
so
that
little
was
said
to
the
purpose
regularly
and
but
little
use
was
made
of
it
they
coming
to
a
very
broken
conclusion
upon
it
to
make
trial
in
a
ship
or
two
from
this
they
fell
to
other
talk
about
the
fighting
this
late
war
and
how
the
king
ships
have
been
shattered
though
the
king
said
that
the
world
would
not
have
it
that
above
ten
or
twenty
ships
in
any
fight
did
do
any
service
and
that
this
hath
been
told
so
to
him
himself
by
ignorant
people
the
prince
who
was
there
was
mightily
surprised
at
it
and
seemed
troubled
but
the
king
told
him
that
it
was
only
discourse
of
the
world
but
wren
whispered
me
in
the
eare
and
said
that
the
duke
of
albemarle
had
put
it
into
his
narrative
for
the
house
that
not
above
ships
fought
in
the
engagement
wherein
he
was
but
that
he
was
advised
to
leave
it
out
but
this
he
did
write
from
sea
i
am
sure
or
words
to
that
effect
and
did
displease
many
commanders
among
others
captain
batts
who
the
duke
of
york
said
was
a
very
stout
man
all
the
world
knew
and
that
another
was
brought
into
his
ship
that
had
been
turned
out
of
his
place
when
he
was
a
boatswain
not
long
before
for
being
a
drunkard
this
the
prince
rupert
took
notice
of
and
would
have
been
angry
i
think
but
they
let
their
discourse
fall
but
the
duke
of
york
was
earnest
in
it
and
the
prince
said
to
me
standing
by
me
if
they
will
turn
out
every
man
that
will
be
drunk
they
must
turn
out
all
the
commanders
in
the
fleet
what
is
the
matter
if
he
be
drunk
so
when
he
comes
to
fight
he
do
his
work
at
least
let
him
be
punished
for
his
drunkenness
and
not
put
out
of
his
command
presently
this
he
spoke
very
much
concerned
for
this
idle
fellow
one
greene
after
this
the
king
began
to
tell
stories
of
the
cowardice
of
the
spaniards
in
flanders
when
he
was
there
at
the
siege
of
mardike
and
dunkirke
which
was
very
pretty
though
he
tells
them
but
meanly
to
westminster
hall
and
there
staid
a
little
and
then
home
and
by
the
way
did
find
with
difficulty
the
life
of
sir
philip
sidney
and
the
bookseller
told
me
that
he
had
sold
four
within
this
week
or
two
which
is
more
than
ever
he
sold
in
all
his
life
of
them
and
he
could
not
imagine
what
should
be
the
reason
of
it
but
i
suppose
it
is
from
the
same
reason
of
people
observing
of
this
part
therein
touching
his
prophecying
our
present
condition
here
in
england
in
relation
to
the
dutch
which
is
very
remarkable
it
is
generally
believed
that
france
is
endeavouring
a
firmer
league
with
us
than
the
former
in
order
to
his
going
on
with
his
business
against
spain
the
next
year
which
i
am
and
so
every
body
else
is
i
think
very
glad
of
for
all
our
fear
is
of
his
invading
us
this
day
at
white
hall
i
overheard
sir
coventry
propose
to
the
king
his
ordering
of
some
particular
thing
in
the
wardrobe
which
was
of
no
great
value
but
yet
as
much
as
it
was
it
was
of
profit
to
the
king
and
saving
to
his
purse
the
king
answered
to
it
with
great
indifferency
as
a
thing
that
it
was
no
great
matter
whether
it
was
done
or
no
sir
coventry
answered
i
see
your
majesty
do
not
remember
the
old
english
proverb
that
will
not
stoop
for
a
pin
will
never
be
worth
a
pound
and
so
they
parted
the
king
bidding
him
do
as
he
would
which
methought
was
an
answer
not
like
a
king
that
did
intend
ever
to
do
well
it
seems
worth
remembering
that
this
day
i
did
hear
my
lord
anglesy
at
the
table
speaking
touching
this
new
act
for
accounts
say
that
the
house
of
lords
did
pass
it
because
it
was
a
senseless
impracticable
ineffectual
and
foolish
act
and
that
my
lord
ashly
having
shown
that
it
was
so
to
the
house
of
lords
the
duke
of
buckingham
did
stand
up
and
told
the
lords
that
they
were
beholden
to
my
lord
ashly
that
having
first
commended
them
for
a
most
grave
and
honourable
assembly
he
thought
it
fit
for
the
house
to
pass
this
act
for
accounts
because
it
was
a
foolish
and
simple
act
and
it
seems
it
was
passed
with
but
a
few
in
the
house
when
it
was
intended
to
have
met
in
a
grand
committee
upon
it
and
it
seems
that
in
itself
it
is
not
to
be
practised
till
after
this
session
of
parliament
by
the
very
words
of
the
act
which
nobody
regarded
and
therefore
can
not
come
in
force
yet
unless
the
next
meeting
they
do
make
a
new
act
for
the
bringing
it
into
force
sooner
which
is
a
strange
omission
but
i
perceive
my
lord
anglesy
do
make
a
mere
of
this
act
as
a
thing
that
can
do
nothing
considerable
for
all
its
great
noise
the
business
of
putting
out
of
some
of
the
is
over
the
king
being
at
last
advised
to
forbear
it
for
whereas
he
did
design
it
to
make
room
for
some
of
the
house
of
commons
that
are
against
him
thereby
to
gratify
them
it
is
believed
that
it
will
but
so
much
the
more
fret
the
rest
that
are
not
provided
for
and
raise
a
new
stock
of
enemies
by
them
that
are
displeased
and
it
goes
for
a
pretty
saying
of
my
lord
up
and
down
the
court
that
he
should
lately
say
to
one
of
the
great
promoters
of
this
putting
him
and
others
out
of
the
council
well
and
what
are
we
to
look
for
when
we
are
outed
will
all
things
be
set
right
in
the
nation
the
other
said
that
he
did
believe
that
many
things
would
be
mended
but
says
my
lord
will
you
and
the
rest
of
you
be
contented
to
be
hanged
if
you
do
not
redeem
all
our
misfortunes
and
set
all
right
if
the
power
be
put
into
your
hands
the
other
answered
no
he
would
not
undertake
that
why
then
says
my
lord
i
and
the
rest
of
us
that
you
are
labouring
to
put
out
will
be
contented
to
be
hanged
if
we
do
not
recover
all
that
is
past
if
the
king
will
put
the
power
into
our
hands
and
adhere
wholly
to
our
advice
to
the
nursery
but
the
house
did
not
act
and
so
i
to
the
other
two
playhouses
into
the
pit
to
gaze
up
and
down
and
there
did
by
this
means
for
nothing
see
an
act
in
the
schoole
of
compliments
at
the
duke
of
york
house
and
henry
the
fourth
at
the
king
house
but
not
liking
either
of
the
plays
i
took
my
coach
again
and
home
to
white
hall
and
by
coach
home
taking
up
prin
at
the
court
gate
it
raining
and
setting
him
down
at
the
temple
and
by
the
way
did
ask
him
about
the
manner
of
holding
of
parliaments
and
whether
the
number
of
knights
and
burgesses
were
always
the
same
and
he
says
that
the
latter
were
not
but
that
for
aught
he
can
find
they
were
sent
up
at
the
discretion
at
first
of
the
sheriffes
to
whom
the
writs
are
sent
to
send
up
generally
the
burgesses
and
citizens
of
their
county
and
he
do
find
that
heretofore
the
being
paid
by
the
country
several
burroughs
have
complained
of
the
sheriffes
putting
them
to
the
charge
of
sending
up
burgesses
which
is
a
very
extraordinary
thing
to
me
that
knew
not
this
but
thought
that
the
number
had
been
known
and
always
the
same
to
white
hall
and
there
to
wait
on
the
duke
of
york
with
the
rest
of
my
brethren
which
we
did
a
little
in
the
while
the
king
was
in
council
and
in
this
room
we
found
my
lord
bristoll
walking
alone
which
wondering
at
while
the
council
was
sitting
i
was
answered
that
as
being
a
catholique
he
could
not
be
of
the
council
which
i
did
not
consider
before
this
day
i
received
a
letter
from
my
father
and
another
from
my
cosen
roger
pepys
who
have
had
a
view
of
jackson
evidences
of
his
estate
and
do
mightily
like
of
the
man
and
his
condition
and
estate
and
do
advise
me
to
accept
of
the
match
for
my
sister
and
to
finish
it
soon
as
i
can
and
he
do
it
so
as
i
confess
i
am
contented
to
have
it
done
and
so
give
her
her
portion
to
the
king
house
to
see
the
wildgoose
chase
by
beaumont
and
fletcher
in
this
play
i
met
with
nothing
extraordinary
at
all
but
very
dull
inventions
and
designs
knipp
came
and
sat
by
us
and
her
talk
pleased
me
a
little
she
tells
me
how
miss
davis
is
for
certain
going
away
from
the
house
the
king
being
in
love
with
her
and
a
house
is
taken
for
her
and
furnishing
and
she
hath
a
ring
given
her
already
worth
that
the
king
did
send
several
times
for
nelly
and
she
was
with
him
and
i
am
sorry
for
it
and
can
hope
for
no
good
to
the
state
from
having
a
prince
so
devoted
to
his
pleasure
she
told
me
also
of
a
play
shortly
coming
upon
the
stage
of
sir
charles
sedley
which
she
thinks
will
be
called
the
wandering
ladys
a
comedy
that
she
thinks
will
be
most
pleasant
and
also
another
play
called
the
duke
of
lorane
besides
catiline
which
she
thinks
for
want
of
the
clothes
which
the
king
promised
them
will
not
be
acted
for
a
good
while
to
my
bookseller
martin
and
there
did
receive
my
book
i
expected
of
china
a
most
excellent
book
with
rare
cuts
and
there
fell
into
discourse
with
him
about
the
burning
of
when
the
city
was
burned
his
house
being
in
the
and
he
tells
me
that
it
took
fire
first
upon
the
end
of
a
board
that
among
others
was
laid
upon
the
roof
instead
of
lead
the
lead
being
broke
off
and
thence
down
lower
and
lower
but
that
the
burning
of
the
goods
under
fayth
arose
from
the
goods
taking
fire
in
the
and
so
got
into
church
and
that
they
first
took
fire
from
the
draper
side
by
some
timber
of
the
houses
that
were
burned
falling
into
the
church
he
says
that
one
warehouse
of
books
was
saved
under
paul
and
there
were
several
dogs
found
burned
among
the
goods
in
the
churchyard
and
but
one
man
which
was
an
old
man
that
said
he
would
go
and
save
a
blanket
which
he
had
in
the
church
and
being
weak
the
fire
overcame
him
he
says
that
most
of
the
booksellers
do
design
to
fall
again
the
next
year
but
that
the
bishop
of
london
do
use
them
most
basely
worse
than
any
other
landlords
and
says
he
will
be
paid
to
this
day
the
rent
or
else
he
will
not
come
to
treat
with
them
for
the
time
to
come
and
will
not
on
that
condition
either
promise
them
in
any
thing
how
he
will
use
them
and
the
parliament
sitting
he
claims
his
privilege
and
will
not
be
cited
before
the
lord
chief
justice
as
others
are
there
to
be
forced
to
a
fair
dealing
thence
by
coach
to
pierce
where
my
wife
is
and
there
they
fell
to
discourse
of
the
last
night
work
at
court
where
the
ladies
and
duke
of
monmouth
and
others
acted
the
indian
emperour
wherein
they
told
me
these
things
most
remarkable
that
not
any
woman
but
the
duchesse
of
monmouth
and
cornwallis
did
any
thing
but
like
fools
and
stocks
but
that
these
two
did
do
most
extraordinary
well
that
not
any
man
did
any
thing
well
but
captain
olrigran
sic
orig
who
spoke
and
did
well
but
above
all
things
did
dance
most
incomparably
that
she
did
sit
near
the
players
of
the
duke
house
among
the
rest
miss
davis
who
is
the
most
impertinent
slut
she
says
in
the
world
and
the
more
now
the
king
do
show
her
countenance
and
is
reckoned
his
mistress
even
to
the
scorne
of
the
whole
world
the
king
gazing
on
her
and
my
lady
castlemaine
being
melancholy
and
out
of
humour
all
the
play
not
smiling
once
the
king
it
seems
hath
given
her
a
ring
of
which
she
shows
to
every
body
and
owns
that
the
king
did
give
it
her
and
he
hath
furnished
a
house
in
most
richly
for
her
which
is
a
most
infinite
shame
it
seems
she
is
a
bastard
of
colonell
howard
my
lord
berkshire
and
that
he
hath
got
her
for
the
king
but
pierce
says
that
she
is
a
most
homely
jade
as
ever
she
saw
though
she
dances
beyond
any
thing
in
the
world
she
tells
me
that
the
duchesse
of
richmond
do
not
yet
come
to
the
court
nor
hath
seen
the
king
nor
will
not
nor
do
he
own
his
desire
of
seeing
her
but
hath
used
means
to
get
her
to
court
but
they
do
not
take
this
afternoon
my
lord
anglesy
tells
us
that
it
is
voted
in
council
to
have
a
fleet
of
ships
out
but
it
is
only
a
disguise
for
the
parliament
to
get
some
money
by
but
it
will
not
take
i
believe
lord
anglesy
tells
us
again
that
a
fleet
is
to
be
set
out
and
that
it
is
generally
he
hears
said
that
it
is
but
a
spanish
rhodomontado
and
that
he
saying
so
just
now
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
who
came
to
town
last
night
after
the
thing
was
ordered
he
told
him
a
story
of
two
seamen
one
wished
all
the
guns
of
the
ship
were
his
and
that
they
were
silver
and
says
the
other
you
are
a
fool
for
if
you
can
have
it
for
wishing
why
do
you
not
wish
them
gold
so
says
he
if
a
rhodomontado
will
do
any
good
why
do
you
not
say
ships
and
it
is
true
for
the
dutch
and
french
are
said
to
make
such
preparations
as
sail
will
do
no
good
mightily
pleased
with
gibson
talking
he
telling
me
so
many
good
stories
relating
to
the
war
and
practices
of
commanders
which
i
will
find
a
time
to
recollect
and
he
will
be
an
admirable
help
to
my
writing
a
history
of
the
navy
if
ever
i
do
much
discourse
of
the
duell
yesterday
between
the
duke
of
buckingham
holmes
and
one
jenkins
on
one
side
and
my
lord
of
shrewsbury
francis
eleventh
earl
of
shrewsbury
died
of
his
wounds
march
following
sir
john
talbot
sir
john
talbot
a
gentleman
of
the
privy
chamber
for
knaresborough
and
one
bernard
howard
bernard
howard
eighth
son
of
henry
frederic
earl
of
arundel
on
the
other
side
and
all
about
my
lady
shrewsbury
anna
maria
daughter
of
robert
earl
of
cardigan
the
duke
of
buckingham
mistress
and
said
to
have
held
his
horse
in
the
habit
of
a
page
while
he
was
fighting
with
her
husband
she
married
secondly
george
rodney
bridges
son
of
sir
thomas
bridges
of
keynsham
somerset
and
died
april
who
is
at
this
time
and
hath
for
a
great
while
been
a
mistress
to
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
so
her
husband
challenged
him
and
they
met
yesterday
in
a
close
near
and
there
fought
and
my
lord
shrewsbury
is
run
through
the
body
from
the
right
breast
through
the
shoulder
and
sir
john
talbot
all
along
up
one
of
his
armes
and
jenkins
killed
upon
the
place
and
the
rest
all
in
a
little
measure
wounded
this
will
make
the
world
think
that
the
king
hath
good
counsellors
about
him
when
the
duke
of
buckingham
the
greatest
man
about
him
is
a
fellow
of
no
more
sobriety
than
to
fight
about
a
mistress
and
this
may
prove
a
very
bad
accident
to
the
duke
of
buckingham
but
that
my
lady
castlemaine
do
rule
all
at
this
time
as
much
as
ever
she
did
and
she
will
it
is
believed
keep
all
matters
well
with
the
duke
of
buckingham
though
this
is
a
time
that
the
king
will
be
very
backward
i
suppose
to
appear
in
such
a
business
and
it
is
pretty
to
hear
how
the
king
had
some
notice
of
this
challenge
a
week
or
two
ago
and
did
give
it
to
my
lord
generall
to
confine
the
duke
or
take
security
that
he
should
not
do
any
such
thing
as
fight
and
the
generall
trusted
to
the
king
that
he
sending
for
him
would
do
it
and
the
king
trusted
to
the
generall
and
it
is
said
that
my
lord
shrewsbury
case
is
to
be
feared
that
he
may
die
too
and
that
may
make
it
much
worse
for
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
i
shall
not
be
much
sorry
for
it
that
we
may
have
some
sober
man
come
in
his
room
to
assist
in
the
government
creed
tells
me
of
harry
howard
giving
the
royall
society
a
piece
of
ground
next
to
his
house
to
build
a
college
on
which
is
a
most
generous
act
and
he
tells
me
he
is
a
very
fine
person
and
understands
and
speaks
well
and
no
rigid
papist
neither
but
one
that
would
not
have
a
protestant
servant
leave
his
religion
which
he
was
going
to
do
thinking
to
recommend
himself
to
his
master
by
it
saying
that
he
had
rather
have
an
honest
protestant
than
a
knavish
catholique
i
was
not
called
in
to
the
council
and
therefore
home
first
informing
myself
that
my
lord
hinchingbroke
hath
been
married
this
week
to
my
lord
burlington
daughter
so
that
that
great
business
is
over
and
i
am
mighty
glad
of
it
though
i
am
not
satisfied
that
i
have
not
a
favour
sent
me
lord
shrewsbury
is
likely
to
do
well
to
drumbleby
the
there
to
advise
about
the
making
of
a
flageolet
to
go
low
and
soft
and
he
do
show
me
a
way
which
do
do
and
also
a
fashion
of
having
two
pipes
of
the
same
note
fastened
together
so
as
i
can
play
on
one
and
then
echo
it
upon
the
other
which
is
mighty
pretty
so
to
my
lord
crewe
to
dinner
where
we
hear
all
the
good
news
of
our
making
a
league
now
with
holland
against
the
french
power
coming
over
them
or
us
which
is
the
first
good
act
that
hath
been
done
a
great
while
and
done
secretly
and
with
great
seeming
wisdom
and
is
certainly
good
for
us
at
this
time
while
we
are
in
no
condition
to
resist
the
french
if
he
should
come
over
hither
and
then
a
little
time
of
peace
will
give
us
time
to
lay
up
something
which
these
commissioners
of
the
treasury
are
doing
and
the
world
do
begin
to
see
that
they
will
do
the
king
work
for
him
if
he
will
let
them
my
lord
told
a
good
story
of
newman
the
minister
in
new
england
who
wrote
the
concordance
of
his
foretelling
his
death
and
preaching
a
funeral
sermon
and
did
at
last
bid
the
angels
do
their
office
and
died
it
seems
there
is
great
presumption
that
there
will
be
a
toleration
granted
so
that
the
presbyterians
do
hold
up
their
heads
but
they
will
hardly
trust
the
king
or
the
parliament
what
to
yield
them
though
most
of
the
sober
party
be
for
some
kind
of
allowance
to
be
given
them
lord
gerard
is
likely
to
meet
with
ill
the
next
sitting
of
parliament
about
carr
being
set
in
the
pillory
and
i
am
glad
of
it
and
it
is
mighty
acceptable
to
the
world
to
hear
that
among
other
reductions
the
king
do
reduce
his
guards
which
do
please
mightily
comes
news
from
kate
joyce
that
if
i
would
see
her
husband
alive
i
must
come
presently
so
i
to
him
and
and
his
breath
rattled
in
the
throate
and
they
did
lay
pigeons
to
his
feet
and
all
despair
of
him
it
seems
on
thursday
last
he
went
sober
and
quiet
to
islington
and
behind
one
of
the
inns
the
white
lion
did
fling
himself
into
a
pond
was
spied
by
a
poor
woman
and
got
out
by
some
people
and
set
on
his
head
and
got
to
life
and
so
his
wife
and
friends
sent
for
he
confessed
his
doing
the
thing
being
led
by
the
devil
and
do
declare
his
reason
to
be
his
trouble
in
having
forgot
to
serve
god
as
he
ought
since
he
came
to
his
new
employment
he
kept
a
tavern
and
i
believe
that
and
the
sense
of
his
great
loss
by
the
fire
did
bring
him
to
it
for
he
grew
sick
and
worse
and
worse
to
this
day
the
friends
that
were
there
being
now
in
fear
that
the
goods
and
estate
would
be
seized
on
though
he
lived
all
this
while
because
of
his
endeavouring
to
drown
himself
my
cosen
did
endeavour
to
remove
what
she
could
of
plate
out
of
the
house
and
desired
me
to
take
my
flagons
which
i
did
but
in
great
fear
all
the
way
of
being
seized
though
there
was
no
reason
for
it
he
not
being
dead
so
with
sir
gauden
to
guild
hall
to
advise
with
the
about
the
practice
of
the
city
and
nation
in
this
case
and
he
thinks
it
can
not
be
found
but
if
it
be
it
will
fall
all
the
estate
to
the
king
so
i
to
my
cosen
again
where
i
no
sooner
come
but
find
that
he
was
departed
so
at
their
entreaty
i
presently
to
white
hall
and
there
find
sir
coventry
and
he
carried
me
to
the
king
the
duke
of
york
being
with
him
and
there
told
my
story
which
i
had
told
him
and
the
king
without
more
ado
granted
that
if
it
was
found
the
estate
should
be
to
the
widow
and
children
which
indeed
was
every
great
courtesy
for
people
are
looking
out
for
the
estate
at
noon
with
any
lord
brouncker
to
sir
gauden
at
the
to
dinner
where
i
have
not
dined
since
he
was
sheriffe
he
expected
us
and
a
good
dinner
and
much
good
company
and
a
fine
house
and
especially
two
rooms
very
fine
he
hath
built
there
his
lady
a
good
lady
but
my
lord
led
himself
and
me
to
a
great
absurdity
in
kissing
all
the
ladies
but
the
finest
of
all
the
company
leaving
her
out
i
know
not
how
and
i
was
loath
to
do
it
since
he
omitted
it
here
little
chaplin
dined
who
is
like
to
be
sheriffe
the
next
year
and
a
pretty
humoured
little
man
he
is
and
mr
talents
the
younger
of
magdalene
college
chaplain
to
the
sheriffe
which
i
was
glad
to
see
though
not
much
acquainted
with
him
at
the
office
all
the
morning
and
at
noon
find
the
bishop
of
lincolne
william
fuller
translated
from
limerick
come
to
dine
with
us
and
after
him
comes
brisband
and
there
mighty
good
company
but
the
bishop
a
very
extraordinary
man
and
one
that
is
mightily
pleased
as
well
as
i
am
that
i
live
so
near
bugden
at
brampton
the
seat
of
his
bishopricke
where
he
is
like
to
reside
and
indeed
i
am
glad
of
it
in
discourse
we
think
ourselves
safe
for
this
year
by
this
league
with
holland
which
pleases
every
body
and
they
say
vexes
france
insomuch
that
de
the
french
embassador
in
holland
when
he
heard
it
told
the
states
that
he
would
have
them
not
forget
that
his
master
is
in
the
head
of
men
and
is
but
years
old
which
was
a
great
speech
the
bishop
tells
me
he
thinks
that
the
great
business
of
toleration
will
not
notwithstanding
this
talk
be
carried
this
parliament
nor
for
the
king
taking
away
the
deans
and
chapters
lands
to
supply
his
wants
they
signifying
little
to
him
if
he
had
them
for
his
present
service
povy
do
tell
me
how
he
is
like
to
lose
his
year
pension
of
the
duke
of
york
which
he
took
in
consideration
of
his
place
that
was
taken
from
him
he
tells
me
the
duchesse
is
a
devil
against
him
and
do
now
come
like
queene
elizabeth
and
sits
with
the
duke
of
york
council
and
sees
what
they
do
and
she
crosses
out
this
man
wages
and
prices
as
she
sees
fit
for
saving
money
but
yet
he
tells
me
she
reserves
gear
for
her
own
spending
and
my
lady
peterborough
by
and
by
tells
me
that
the
duchesse
do
lay
up
mightily
jewells
to
white
hall
and
by
and
by
the
duke
of
york
comes
and
we
had
a
little
meeting
anglesy
pen
and
i
there
and
none
else
and
among
other
things
did
discourse
of
the
want
of
discipline
in
the
fleet
which
the
duke
of
york
confessed
and
yet
said
that
he
while
he
was
there
did
keep
it
in
a
good
measure
but
that
it
was
now
lost
when
he
was
absent
but
he
will
endeavour
to
have
it
again
that
he
did
tell
the
prince
and
duke
of
albemarle
they
would
lose
all
order
by
making
such
and
such
men
commanders
which
they
would
because
they
were
stout
men
he
told
them
it
was
a
reproach
to
the
nation
as
if
there
were
no
sober
men
among
us
that
were
stout
to
be
had
that
they
did
put
out
some
men
for
cowards
that
the
duke
of
york
had
put
in
but
little
before
for
stout
men
and
would
now
were
he
to
go
to
sea
again
entertain
them
in
his
own
division
to
choose
and
did
put
in
an
idle
fellow
greene
who
was
hardly
thought
fit
for
a
boatswain
by
him
they
did
put
him
from
being
a
lieutenant
to
a
captain
place
of
a
ship
as
idle
a
drunken
fellow
he
said
as
any
was
in
the
fleet
that
he
will
now
desire
the
king
to
let
him
be
what
he
is
that
is
admirall
and
he
will
put
in
none
but
those
that
he
hath
great
reason
to
think
well
of
and
particularly
says
that
though
he
likes
colonel
legg
well
yet
his
son
that
was
he
knows
not
how
made
a
captain
after
he
had
been
but
one
voyage
at
sea
he
should
go
to
sea
another
apprenticeship
before
ever
he
gives
him
a
command
we
did
tell
him
of
the
many
defects
and
disorders
among
the
captains
and
i
prayed
we
might
do
it
in
writing
to
him
which
he
liked
and
i
am
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
doing
it
my
wife
this
day
hears
from
her
father
and
mother
they
are
in
france
at
paris
he
poor
good
man
thankful
for
my
small
charities
to
him
to
sir
coventry
he
tells
me
he
hath
no
friends
in
the
whole
court
but
my
lord
keeper
and
sir
john
duncomb
they
have
reduced
the
charges
of
ireland
about
and
thereby
cut
off
good
profits
from
my
lord
lieutenant
which
will
make
a
new
enemy
but
he
cares
not
he
tells
me
that
townsend
of
the
wardrobe
is
the
veriest
knave
and
bufflehead
that
over
he
saw
i
first
heard
that
my
cosen
pepys
of
salisbury
court
was
marshall
to
my
lord
coke
when
he
was
lord
chief
justice
which
beginning
of
his
i
did
not
know
to
be
so
low
but
so
it
was
it
seems
up
and
by
coach
with
griffin
with
me
and
our
to
durham
yard
to
the
commissioners
for
accounts
the
first
time
i
ever
was
there
and
staid
awhile
before
i
was
admitted
to
them
i
did
observe
a
great
many
people
attending
about
complaints
of
seamen
concerning
tickets
and
among
others
carcasse
and
martin
my
purser
and
i
observe
a
fellow
one
collins
is
there
who
is
employed
by
these
commissioners
particularly
to
hold
an
office
in
street
or
somewhere
thereabouts
to
receive
complaints
of
all
people
about
tickets
and
i
believe
he
will
have
work
enough
presently
i
was
called
in
where
i
found
the
whole
number
of
commissioners
and
was
there
received
with
great
respect
and
kindness
and
did
give
them
great
satisfaction
making
it
my
endeavour
to
inform
them
what
it
was
they
were
to
expect
from
me
and
what
was
the
duty
of
other
people
this
being
my
only
way
to
preserve
myself
after
all
my
pains
and
trouble
they
did
ask
many
questions
and
demanded
other
books
of
me
which
i
did
give
them
very
ready
and
acceptable
answers
to
and
upon
the
whole
i
do
observe
they
go
about
their
business
like
men
resolved
to
go
through
with
it
and
in
a
very
good
method
like
men
of
understanding
they
have
jessop
their
secretary
and
it
is
pretty
to
see
that
they
are
fain
to
find
out
an
man
of
cromwell
to
do
their
business
for
them
as
well
as
the
parliament
to
pitch
upon
such
for
the
most
part
in
the
lowest
of
people
that
were
brought
into
the
house
for
commissioners
i
went
away
giving
and
receiving
great
satisfaction
and
so
to
white
hall
to
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
where
waiting
some
time
i
there
met
with
colonell
birch
and
he
and
i
fell
into
discourse
and
i
did
give
him
thanks
for
his
kindness
to
me
in
the
both
before
my
face
and
behind
my
back
he
told
me
that
he
knew
me
to
be
a
man
of
the
old
way
of
taking
pains
and
did
always
endeavour
to
do
me
right
and
prevent
any
thing
that
was
moved
that
might
tend
to
my
injury
which
i
was
obliged
to
him
for
and
thanked
him
thence
to
talk
of
other
things
and
the
want
of
money
and
he
told
me
of
the
general
want
of
money
in
the
country
that
land
sold
for
nothing
and
the
many
pennyworths
he
knows
of
lands
and
houses
upon
them
with
good
titles
in
his
country
at
years
purchase
and
says
he
though
i
am
in
debt
yet
i
have
a
mind
to
one
thing
and
that
is
a
bishop
lease
but
said
i
will
yet
choose
such
a
lease
before
any
other
because
i
know
they
can
not
stand
and
then
it
will
fall
into
the
king
hands
and
i
in
possession
shall
have
an
advantage
by
it
says
he
i
know
they
must
fall
and
they
are
now
near
it
taking
all
the
ways
they
can
to
undo
themselves
and
showing
us
the
way
and
thereupon
told
me
a
story
of
the
present
quarrel
between
the
bishop
john
hacket
and
dean
henry
greswold
of
coventry
and
lichfield
the
former
of
whom
did
excommunicate
the
latter
and
caused
his
excommunication
to
be
read
in
the
church
while
he
was
there
and
after
it
was
read
the
dean
made
the
service
be
gone
through
with
though
himself
an
excommunicate
was
present
which
is
contrary
to
the
canon
and
said
he
would
justify
the
quire
therein
against
the
bishop
and
so
they
are
at
law
in
the
arches
about
it
which
is
a
very
pretty
story
he
tells
me
that
the
king
is
for
toleration
though
the
bishops
be
against
it
and
that
he
do
not
doubt
but
it
will
be
carried
in
parliament
but
that
he
fears
some
will
stand
for
the
tolerating
of
papists
with
the
rest
and
that
he
knows
not
what
to
say
but
rather
thinks
that
the
sober
party
will
be
without
it
rather
than
have
it
upon
those
terms
and
i
do
believe
so
it
is
observed
and
is
true
in
the
late
fire
of
london
that
the
fire
burned
just
as
many
as
there
were
hours
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
fire
and
next
that
there
were
just
as
many
churches
left
standing
as
there
were
taverns
left
standing
in
the
rest
of
the
city
that
was
not
burned
being
i
think
thirteen
in
all
of
each
which
is
pretty
to
observe
february
to
the
office
till
past
two
where
at
the
board
some
high
words
passed
between
sir
pen
and
i
begun
by
me
and
yielded
to
by
him
i
being
in
the
right
in
finding
fault
with
him
for
his
neglect
of
duty
home
my
head
mighty
full
of
business
now
on
my
hands
viz
of
finishing
my
tangier
accounts
of
auditing
my
last
year
accounts
of
preparing
answers
to
the
commissioners
of
accounts
of
drawing
up
several
important
letters
to
the
duke
of
york
and
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
the
marrying
of
my
sister
the
building
of
a
coach
and
stables
against
summer
and
the
setting
many
things
in
the
office
right
and
the
drawing
up
a
new
form
of
contract
with
the
victualler
of
the
navy
and
several
other
things
which
pains
however
will
go
through
with
moore
mightily
commends
my
lord
hinchingbroke
match
and
lady
though
he
buys
her
dear
by
the
jointure
and
settlement
his
father
makes
her
and
says
that
the
duke
of
york
and
duchesse
of
york
did
come
to
see
them
in
bed
together
on
their
and
how
my
lord
had
fifty
pieces
of
gold
taken
out
of
his
pocket
that
night
after
he
was
in
bed
he
tells
me
that
an
act
of
comprehension
is
likely
to
pass
this
parliament
for
admitting
of
all
persuasions
in
religion
to
the
public
observation
of
their
particular
worship
but
in
certain
places
and
the
persons
therein
concerned
to
be
listed
of
this
or
that
church
which
it
is
thought
will
do
them
more
hurt
than
good
and
make
them
not
own
their
persuasion
he
tells
me
that
there
is
a
pardon
passed
to
the
duke
of
buckingham
my
lord
of
shrewsbury
and
the
rest
for
the
late
duell
and
murder
which
he
thinks
a
worse
fault
than
any
ill
use
my
late
lord
chancellor
ever
put
the
great
seal
to
and
will
be
so
thought
by
the
parliament
for
them
to
be
pardoned
without
bringing
them
to
any
trial
and
that
my
lord
therefore
would
not
have
it
pass
his
hand
but
made
it
go
by
immediate
warrant
or
at
least
they
knew
that
he
would
not
pass
it
and
so
did
direct
it
to
go
by
immediate
warrant
that
it
might
not
come
to
him
he
tells
me
what
a
character
my
lord
sandwich
hath
sent
over
of
godolphin
sidney
godolphin
groom
of
the
bedchamber
to
charles
ii
made
a
commissioner
of
the
treasury
and
in
created
baron
godolphin
as
the
worthiest
man
and
such
a
friend
to
him
as
he
may
be
trusted
in
any
thing
relating
to
him
in
the
world
as
one
whom
he
says
he
hath
infallible
assurances
that
he
will
remaine
his
friend
which
is
very
high
but
indeed
they
say
the
gentleman
is
a
fine
man
sir
cholmly
tells
me
how
the
parliament
which
is
to
meet
again
are
likely
to
fall
heavy
on
the
business
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
pardon
and
i
shall
be
glad
of
it
and
that
the
king
hath
put
out
of
the
court
the
two
hides
my
lord
chancellor
two
sons
and
also
the
bishops
of
rochester
john
dolben
and
winchester
george
morley
the
latter
of
whom
should
have
preached
before
him
yesterday
being
and
had
sermon
ready
but
was
put
by
which
is
great
news
my
wife
being
gone
before
i
to
the
duke
of
york
playhouse
where
a
new
play
of
etheridge
called
she
would
if
she
could
and
though
i
was
there
by
two
there
was
people
put
back
that
could
not
have
room
in
the
pit
and
i
at
last
because
my
wife
was
there
made
shift
to
get
into
the
box
and
there
saw
but
lord
how
full
was
the
house
and
how
silly
the
play
there
being
nothing
in
the
world
good
in
it
and
few
people
pleased
in
it
the
king
was
there
but
i
sat
mightily
behind
and
could
see
but
little
and
hear
not
all
the
play
being
done
i
into
the
pit
to
look
for
my
wife
it
being
dark
and
raining
but
could
not
find
her
and
so
staid
going
between
the
two
doors
and
through
the
pit
an
hour
and
half
i
think
after
the
play
was
done
the
people
staying
there
till
the
rain
was
over
and
to
talk
one
with
another
and
among
the
rest
here
was
the
duke
of
buckingham
openly
sat
in
the
pit
and
there
i
found
him
with
my
lord
buckhurst
and
sedley
and
etheridge
the
poet
the
last
of
whom
i
did
hear
mightily
find
fault
with
the
actors
that
they
were
out
of
humour
and
had
not
their
parts
perfect
and
that
harris
did
do
nothing
nor
could
so
much
as
sing
a
ketch
in
it
and
so
was
mightily
concerned
while
all
the
rest
did
through
the
whole
pit
blame
the
play
as
a
silly
dull
thing
though
there
was
something
very
roguish
and
witty
but
the
design
of
the
play
and
end
mighty
insipid
at
last
i
did
find
my
wife
met
my
cosen
roger
pepys
the
parliament
meeting
yesterday
and
adjourned
to
monday
next
and
here
he
tells
me
that
jackson
my
sister
servant
is
come
to
town
and
hath
this
day
suffered
a
recovery
on
his
estate
in
order
to
the
making
her
a
settlement
there
is
a
great
triall
between
my
lord
gerard
and
carr
who
is
indicted
for
his
life
at
the
king
bench
for
running
from
his
colours
but
all
do
say
that
my
lord
gerard
though
he
designs
the
ruin
of
this
man
will
not
get
any
thing
by
it
met
my
cosen
roger
again
and
jackson
who
is
a
plain
young
man
handsome
enough
for
her
paulina
peps
one
of
no
education
nor
discourse
but
of
few
words
and
one
altogether
that
i
think
will
please
me
well
enough
my
cosen
had
got
me
to
give
the
odd
sixth
presently
which
i
intended
to
keep
to
the
birth
of
the
first
child
and
let
it
go
i
shall
be
eased
of
the
care
so
there
parted
my
mind
pretty
well
satisfied
with
this
plain
fellow
for
my
sister
though
i
shall
i
see
have
no
pleasure
nor
content
in
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
man
of
reading
and
parts
like
cumberland
the
great
talk
is
of
carr
coming
off
in
all
his
trials
to
the
disgrace
of
my
lord
gerard
to
that
degree
and
the
ripping
up
of
so
many
notorious
rogueries
and
cheats
of
my
lord
that
my
lord
it
is
thought
will
be
ruined
and
above
all
do
show
the
madness
of
the
house
of
commons
who
rejected
the
petition
of
this
poor
man
by
a
combination
of
a
few
in
the
house
and
much
more
the
base
proceedings
just
the
epitome
of
all
our
publick
managements
in
this
age
of
the
house
of
lords
that
ordered
him
to
stand
in
the
pillory
for
those
very
things
without
hearing
and
examining
what
he
hath
now
by
the
seeking
of
my
lord
gerard
himself
cleared
himself
of
in
open
court
to
the
gaining
himself
the
pity
of
all
the
world
and
shame
for
ever
to
my
lord
gerard
made
a
visit
to
godolphin
at
his
chamber
and
i
do
find
him
a
very
pretty
and
able
person
a
man
of
very
fine
parts
and
of
infinite
zeal
to
my
lord
sandwich
and
one
that
says
he
is
he
believes
as
wise
and
able
a
person
as
any
prince
in
the
world
hath
he
tells
me
that
he
meets
with
unmannerly
usage
by
sir
robert
southwell
he
was
knighted
and
sent
as
envoy
extraordinary
to
portugal
and
with
the
same
rank
to
brussels
in
he
became
afterwards
clerk
to
the
privy
council
and
was
five
times
elected
president
of
the
royal
society
ob
aged
in
portugall
who
would
sign
with
him
in
his
negociations
there
being
a
forward
young
man
but
that
my
lord
mastered
him
in
that
point
it
being
ruled
for
my
lord
here
at
a
hearing
of
a
committee
of
the
council
he
says
that
if
my
lord
can
compass
a
peace
between
spain
and
portugall
and
hath
the
doing
of
it
and
the
honour
himself
it
will
be
a
thing
of
more
honour
than
ever
any
man
had
and
of
as
much
advantage
thence
to
westminster
hall
where
the
hall
mighty
full
and
among
other
things
the
house
begins
to
sit
and
the
king
came
but
before
the
king
coming
the
house
of
commons
met
and
upon
information
given
them
of
a
bill
intended
to
be
brought
in
as
common
report
said
for
comprehension
they
did
mightily
and
generally
inveigh
against
it
and
did
vote
that
the
king
should
be
desired
by
the
house
and
the
message
delivered
by
the
of
the
house
that
the
laws
against
breakers
of
the
act
for
uniformity
should
be
put
in
execution
and
it
was
moved
in
the
house
that
if
any
people
had
a
mind
to
bring
any
new
laws
into
the
house
about
religion
they
might
come
as
a
proposer
of
new
laws
did
in
athens
with
ropes
about
their
necks
by
and
by
the
king
comes
to
the
lords
house
and
there
tells
them
of
his
league
with
holland
and
the
necessity
of
a
fleet
and
his
debts
and
therefore
want
of
money
and
his
desire
that
they
would
think
of
some
way
to
bring
in
all
his
protestant
subjects
to
a
right
understanding
and
peace
one
with
another
meaning
the
bill
of
comprehension
the
commons
coming
to
their
house
it
was
moved
that
the
vote
passed
this
morning
might
be
suspended
because
of
the
king
speech
till
the
house
was
full
and
called
over
two
days
hence
but
it
was
denied
so
furious
they
are
against
this
bill
and
thereby
a
great
blow
either
given
to
the
king
or
presbyters
or
which
is
the
rather
of
the
two
to
the
house
itself
by
denying
a
thing
desired
by
the
king
and
so
much
desired
by
much
the
greater
part
of
the
nation
whatever
the
consequence
be
if
the
king
be
a
man
of
any
stomach
and
heat
all
do
believe
that
he
will
resent
this
vote
read
over
and
agreed
upon
the
deed
of
settlement
to
our
minds
my
sister
to
have
presently
and
she
to
be
joyntured
in
per
annum
wherein
i
am
very
well
satisfied
to
pemberton
francis
pemberton
afterwards
knighted
and
made
lord
chief
justice
of
the
king
bench
chamber
it
was
pretty
here
to
see
the
heaps
of
money
upon
this
table
and
more
to
see
how
he
had
not
since
last
night
spent
any
time
upon
our
business
but
begun
with
telling
us
that
we
were
not
at
all
concerned
in
that
act
which
was
a
total
mistake
by
his
not
having
read
over
the
act
at
all
my
cosen
roger
told
me
the
pleasant
passage
of
a
bringing
a
bag
of
letters
into
the
lobby
of
the
house
where
he
left
them
and
withdrew
himself
without
observation
the
bag
being
opened
the
letters
were
found
all
of
one
size
and
directed
with
one
hand
a
letter
to
most
of
the
members
of
the
house
the
house
was
acquainted
with
it
and
voted
they
should
be
brought
in
and
one
opened
by
the
speaker
wherein
if
he
found
any
thing
unfit
to
communicate
to
propose
a
committee
to
be
chosen
for
it
the
speaker
opening
one
found
it
only
a
case
with
a
libell
in
it
printed
a
satire
most
sober
and
bitter
as
ever
i
read
and
every
letter
was
the
same
so
the
house
fell
scrambling
for
them
like
boys
and
my
cosen
roger
had
one
directed
to
him
which
he
lent
me
to
read
brisband
tells
me
in
discourse
that
tom
killigrew
hath
a
fee
out
of
the
wardrobe
for
cap
and
bells
under
the
title
of
the
king
foole
or
jester
and
may
revile
or
jeere
any
body
the
greatest
person
without
offence
by
the
privilege
of
his
place
this
morning
sir
carteret
come
to
the
office
to
see
and
talk
with
me
and
he
assures
me
that
to
this
day
the
king
is
the
most
kind
man
to
my
lord
sandwich
in
the
whole
world
that
he
himself
do
not
now
mind
any
publick
business
but
suffers
things
to
go
on
at
court
as
they
will
he
seeing
all
likely
to
come
to
ruin
that
this
morning
the
duke
of
york
sent
to
him
to
come
to
make
up
one
of
a
committee
of
the
council
for
navy
affairs
upon
which
when
he
came
he
told
the
duke
of
york
that
he
was
none
of
them
which
shows
how
things
are
ordered
that
there
should
be
a
committee
for
the
navy
and
the
lord
admirall
knows
not
the
persons
of
it
and
that
sir
carteret
and
my
lord
anglesy
should
be
left
out
of
it
and
men
wholly
improper
put
into
it
i
do
hear
of
in
hands
that
there
is
great
difference
at
this
day
between
my
lord
arlington
and
sir
coventry
which
i
am
sorry
for
i
to
my
office
to
perfect
my
narrative
about
and
did
carry
it
to
the
commissioners
of
accounts
who
did
receive
it
with
great
kindness
and
express
great
value
of
and
respect
to
me
and
my
heart
is
at
rest
that
it
is
lodged
there
in
so
full
truth
and
plainness
though
it
may
hereafter
prove
some
loss
to
me
but
here
i
do
see
they
are
entered
into
many
enquiries
about
prizes
by
the
great
attendance
of
commanders
and
others
before
them
which
is
a
work
i
am
not
sorry
for
thence
i
away
with
my
head
busy
but
my
heart
at
pretty
good
ease
to
visit
colonell
thomson
one
of
the
committee
of
accounts
who
among
the
rest
is
mighty
kind
to
me
and
is
likely
to
mind
our
business
more
than
any
and
i
would
be
glad
to
have
a
good
understanding
with
him
thence
after
dinner
to
white
hall
to
attend
the
duke
of
york
where
i
did
let
him
know
too
the
troublesome
life
we
lead
and
particularly
myself
by
being
obliged
to
such
attendances
every
day
as
i
am
on
one
committee
or
other
and
i
do
find
the
duke
of
york
himself
troubled
and
willing
not
to
be
troubled
with
occasions
of
having
his
name
used
among
the
parliament
though
he
himself
do
declare
that
he
did
give
directions
to
lord
brouncker
to
discharge
the
men
at
chatham
by
ticket
and
will
own
it
if
the
house
call
for
it
but
not
else
thence
i
attended
the
king
and
council
and
some
of
the
rest
of
us
in
a
business
to
be
heard
about
the
value
of
a
ship
of
one
dorrington
and
it
was
pretty
to
observe
how
sir
pen
making
use
of
this
argument
against
the
validity
of
an
oath
against
the
king
being
made
by
the
master
mate
of
the
ship
who
was
but
a
fellow
of
about
years
of
age
the
master
of
the
ship
against
whom
we
pleaded
did
say
that
he
did
think
himself
at
that
age
capable
of
being
master
mate
of
any
ship
and
do
know
that
he
sir
pen
was
so
himself
and
in
no
better
degree
at
that
age
himself
which
word
did
strike
sir
pen
mad
and
made
him
open
his
mouth
no
more
and
i
saw
the
king
and
duke
of
york
wink
at
one
another
at
it
this
done
we
into
the
gallery
and
there
i
walked
with
several
people
and
among
others
my
lord
brouncker
who
i
do
find
under
much
trouble
still
about
the
business
of
the
tickets
his
very
case
being
brought
in
as
is
said
this
day
in
the
report
of
the
miscarriages
and
he
seems
to
lay
much
of
it
on
me
which
i
did
clear
and
satisfy
him
in
and
would
be
glad
with
all
my
heart
to
serve
him
in
and
have
done
it
more
than
he
hath
done
for
himself
he
not
deserving
the
least
blame
but
commendations
for
this
i
met
with
my
cosen
roger
pepys
and
creed
and
from
them
understand
that
the
report
was
read
of
the
miscarriages
wherein
my
lord
sandwich
is
named
about
the
business
i
mentioned
this
morning
but
i
will
be
at
rest
for
it
can
do
him
no
hurt
our
business
of
tickets
is
soundly
up
and
many
others
so
they
went
over
them
again
and
spent
all
the
morning
on
the
first
which
is
the
dividing
of
the
fleet
wherein
hot
work
was
and
that
among
great
men
counsellors
and
they
say
sir
coventry
but
i
do
not
much
fear
it
but
do
hope
that
it
will
show
a
little
of
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
the
prince
to
have
been
advisers
in
it
but
whereas
they
ordered
that
the
king
speech
should
be
considered
they
took
no
notice
of
it
at
all
but
are
really
come
to
despise
the
king
in
all
possible
ways
of
showing
it
and
it
was
the
other
day
a
strange
saying
as
i
am
told
by
my
cosen
roger
pepys
in
the
house
when
it
was
moved
that
the
king
speech
should
be
considered
that
though
the
first
part
of
the
speech
meaning
the
league
that
is
there
talked
of
be
the
only
good
publick
thing
that
hath
been
done
since
the
king
come
into
england
yet
it
might
bear
with
being
put
off
to
consider
till
friday
next
which
was
this
day
secretary
morrice
did
this
day
in
the
house
when
they
talked
of
intelligence
say
that
he
was
allowed
but
for
intelligence
whereas
in
time
he
did
allow
for
it
and
was
confirmed
therein
by
colonell
birch
who
said
that
thereby
cromwell
carried
the
secrets
of
all
the
princes
of
europe
at
his
girdle
the
house
is
in
a
most
broken
condition
nobody
adhering
to
any
thing
but
reviling
and
finding
fault
and
now
quite
mad
at
the
undertakers
as
they
are
commonly
called
littleton
lord
vaughan
sir
howard
and
others
that
are
brought
over
to
the
court
and
did
undertake
to
get
the
king
money
but
they
despise
and
will
not
hear
them
in
the
house
and
the
court
do
as
much
seeing
that
they
can
not
be
useful
to
them
as
was
expected
in
short
it
is
plain
that
the
king
will
never
be
able
to
do
any
thing
with
this
parliament
and
that
the
only
likely
way
to
do
better
for
it
can
not
do
worse
is
to
break
this
and
call
another
parliament
and
some
do
think
that
it
is
intended
i
was
told
that
my
lady
castlemaine
is
so
great
a
gamester
as
to
have
won
in
one
night
and
lost
in
another
night
at
play
and
hath
played
and
at
a
cast
hollier
he
was
a
surgeon
dined
with
my
wife
and
me
much
discourse
about
the
bad
state
of
the
church
and
how
the
clergy
are
come
to
be
men
of
no
worth
in
the
world
and
as
the
world
do
now
generally
discourse
they
must
be
reformed
and
i
believe
the
hierarchy
will
in
a
little
time
be
shaken
whether
they
will
or
no
the
king
being
offended
with
them
and
set
upon
it
as
i
hear
great
high
words
in
the
house
on
saturday
last
upon
the
first
part
of
the
committee
report
about
the
dividing
of
the
fleet
wherein
some
would
have
the
counsels
of
the
king
to
be
declared
and
the
reasons
of
them
and
who
did
give
them
where
sir
coventry
laid
open
to
them
the
consequences
of
doing
that
that
the
king
would
never
have
any
honest
and
wise
men
ever
to
be
of
his
council
they
did
here
in
the
house
talk
boldly
of
the
king
bad
counsellors
and
how
they
must
all
be
turned
out
and
many
others
and
better
brought
in
and
the
proceedings
of
the
in
the
beginning
of
the
war
were
called
to
memory
and
the
king
bad
intelligence
was
mentioned
wherein
they
were
bitter
against
my
lord
arlington
saying
among
other
things
that
whatever
morrice
was
who
declared
he
had
but
allowed
him
for
intelligence
the
king
paid
too
dear
for
my
lord
arlington
in
giving
him
and
a
barony
for
it
sir
coventry
did
here
come
to
his
defence
in
the
business
of
the
letter
that
was
sent
to
call
back
prince
rupert
after
he
was
divided
from
the
fleet
wherein
great
delay
was
objected
but
he
did
show
that
he
sent
it
at
one
in
the
morning
when
the
duke
of
york
did
give
him
the
instructions
after
supper
that
night
and
did
clear
himself
well
of
it
only
it
was
laid
as
a
fault
which
i
know
not
how
he
removes
of
not
sending
it
by
an
express
but
by
the
ordinary
post
it
coming
not
to
sir
philip
hand
at
portsmouth
till
four
in
the
afternoon
that
day
being
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
hours
in
going
the
dividing
of
the
fleet
however
is
i
hear
voted
a
miscarriage
and
the
not
building
a
fortification
at
sheernesse
and
i
have
reason
every
hour
to
expect
that
they
will
vote
the
like
of
our
paying
men
off
by
ticket
and
what
the
consequence
of
that
will
be
i
know
not
sir
coventry
and
i
did
look
over
the
list
of
commanders
and
found
that
we
could
presently
recollect
seven
commanders
that
have
been
killed
in
actuall
service
this
war
he
tells
me
that
sir
fr
hollis
is
the
main
man
that
hath
prosecuted
him
hitherto
in
the
business
of
dividing
the
fleet
saying
vainly
that
the
want
of
that
letter
to
the
prince
hath
given
him
that
that
he
shall
remember
it
by
to
his
grave
meaning
the
loss
of
his
arme
vide
note
june
when
god
knows
he
is
as
idle
and
insignificant
a
fellow
as
ever
came
into
the
fleet
i
well
remember
what
in
mirth
he
said
to
me
this
morning
when
upon
this
discourse
he
said
if
ever
there
was
another
dutch
war
they
should
not
find
a
secretary
nor
said
i
a
clerk
of
the
acts
for
i
see
the
reward
of
it
and
thank
god
i
have
enough
of
my
own
to
buy
me
a
book
and
a
good
fiddle
and
i
have
a
good
wife
why
says
he
i
have
enough
to
buy
me
a
good
book
and
shall
not
need
a
fiddle
because
i
have
never
a
one
of
your
good
wives
this
morning
the
house
is
upon
a
bill
brought
in
by
sir
richard
temple
for
obliging
the
king
to
call
parliaments
every
three
years
or
if
he
fail
for
others
to
be
obliged
to
do
it
and
to
keep
him
from
a
power
of
dissolving
any
parliament
in
less
than
forty
days
after
their
first
day
of
sitting
which
is
such
a
bill
as
do
speak
very
high
proceedings
to
the
lessening
of
the
king
and
this
they
will
carry
and
whatever
else
they
desire
before
they
will
give
any
money
and
the
king
must
have
money
whatever
it
cost
him
i
to
see
kate
joyce
where
i
find
her
and
her
friends
in
great
ease
of
mind
the
jury
having
this
day
given
in
their
verdict
that
her
husband
died
of
a
fever
some
opposition
there
was
the
foreman
pressing
them
to
declare
the
cause
of
the
fever
thinking
thereby
to
obstruct
it
but
they
did
adhere
to
their
verdict
and
would
give
no
reason
so
all
trouble
is
now
over
and
she
safe
in
her
estate
in
the
evening
to
white
hall
where
i
find
sir
coventry
a
great
while
with
the
duke
of
york
in
the
king
they
two
talking
together
all
alone
which
did
mightily
please
me
i
do
hear
how
la
roche
a
french
captain
who
was
once
prisoner
here
being
with
his
ship
at
plymouth
hath
played
some
freakes
there
for
which
his
men
being
beat
out
of
the
town
he
hath
put
up
a
flag
of
defiance
and
also
somewhere
there
about
did
land
with
his
men
and
go
a
mile
into
the
country
and
did
some
prank
which
sounds
pretty
odd
to
our
disgrace
but
we
are
in
condition
now
to
bear
any
thing
but
blessed
be
god
all
the
court
is
full
of
good
news
of
my
lord
sandwich
having
made
a
peace
between
spain
and
portugall
which
is
mighty
great
news
and
above
all
to
my
lord
honour
more
than
any
thing
he
ever
did
and
yet
i
do
fear
it
will
not
prevail
to
secure
him
in
parliament
against
incivilities
there
the
house
most
of
the
morning
upon
the
business
of
not
prosecuting
the
first
victory
which
they
have
voted
one
of
the
greatest
miscarriages
of
the
whole
war
though
they
can
not
lay
the
fault
any
where
yet
because
harman
is
not
come
home
dined
and
by
one
to
the
king
house
a
new
play
the
duke
of
lerma
of
sir
robert
howard
where
the
king
and
court
was
and
knipp
and
nell
spoke
the
prologue
most
excellently
especially
knipp
who
spoke
beyond
any
creature
i
ever
heard
the
play
designed
to
reproach
our
king
with
his
mistresses
that
i
was
troubled
for
it
and
expected
it
should
be
interrupted
but
it
ended
all
well
which
salved
all
the
house
this
day
is
still
as
backward
for
giving
any
money
as
ever
and
do
declare
they
will
first
have
an
account
of
the
disposals
of
the
last
and
eleven
months
tax
and
it
is
pretty
odde
that
the
very
first
sum
mentioned
in
the
account
brought
in
by
sir
robert
long
of
the
disposal
of
the
money
is
to
my
lord
arlington
for
intelligence
which
was
mighty
unseasonable
so
soon
after
they
had
so
much
cried
out
against
his
want
of
intelligence
the
king
do
also
own
but
or
thereabouts
yet
paid
on
the
and
that
he
hath
charged
upon
it
this
makes
them
mad
for
that
the
former
that
was
so
much
less
in
its
extent
than
the
last
which
took
in
all
sexes
and
qualities
did
come
to
upon
the
whole
i
perceive
they
are
like
to
do
nothing
in
this
matter
to
please
the
king
or
relieve
the
state
be
the
case
never
so
pressing
and
therefore
it
is
thought
by
a
great
many
that
the
king
can
not
be
worse
if
he
should
dissolve
them
but
there
is
nobody
dares
advise
it
nor
do
he
consider
any
thing
himself
my
cosen
roger
pepys
showed
me
granger
written
confession
of
his
being
forced
by
imprisonment
by
my
lord
gerard
most
barbarously
to
confess
his
forging
of
a
deed
in
behalf
of
fitton
in
the
great
case
between
him
and
my
lord
gerard
which
business
is
under
examination
and
is
the
foulest
against
my
lord
gerard
that
ever
any
thing
in
the
world
was
and
will
all
do
believe
ruine
him
and
i
shall
be
glad
of
it
to
the
duke
playhouse
and
there
saw
alblemanazar
albumazar
a
comedy
by
tomkins
of
trin
coll
cambridge
an
old
play
this
the
second
time
of
acting
it
is
said
to
have
been
the
ground
of
jonson
alchymist
but
saving
the
ridiculousnesse
of
angell
part
which
is
called
trinkilo
i
do
not
see
any
thing
extraordinary
in
it
but
was
indeed
wary
of
it
before
it
was
done
the
king
here
and
indeed
all
of
us
pretty
merry
at
the
mimique
tricks
of
trinkilo
i
met
with
sir
coventry
and
he
and
i
walked
awhile
together
in
the
matted
gallery
and
there
he
told
me
all
the
proceedings
yesterday
that
the
matter
is
found
in
general
a
miscarriage
but
no
persons
named
and
so
there
is
no
great
matter
to
our
prejudice
yet
till
if
ever
they
come
to
particular
persons
he
told
me
birch
was
very
industrious
to
do
what
he
could
and
did
like
a
friend
but
they
were
resolved
to
find
the
thing
in
general
a
miscarriage
and
says
that
when
we
shall
think
fit
to
desire
its
being
heard
as
to
our
own
defence
it
will
be
granted
he
tells
me
how
he
hath
with
advantage
cleared
himself
in
what
concerns
himself
therein
by
his
servant
robson
which
i
am
glad
of
he
tells
me
that
there
is
a
letter
sent
by
conspiracy
to
some
of
the
house
which
he
hath
seen
about
the
manner
of
selling
of
places
which
he
do
believe
he
shall
be
called
upon
for
and
thinks
himself
well
prepared
to
defend
himself
in
it
and
then
neither
he
nor
his
friends
for
him
are
afraid
of
any
thing
to
his
prejudice
thence
by
coach
with
brisband
to
sir
carteret
in
lincoln
fields
and
there
dined
a
good
dinner
and
good
company
and
after
dinner
he
and
i
alone
discoursing
of
my
lord
matters
who
hath
in
the
first
business
before
the
house
been
very
kindly
used
beyond
expectation
the
matter
being
laid
by
till
his
coming
home
and
old
vaughan
did
speak
for
my
lord
which
i
am
mighty
glad
of
the
business
of
the
prizes
is
the
worst
that
can
be
said
and
therein
i
do
fear
something
may
lie
hard
upon
him
but
against
this
we
must
prepare
the
best
we
can
for
his
defence
thence
with
sir
carteret
to
white
hall
where
finding
a
meeting
of
the
committee
of
the
council
for
the
navy
his
royal
highness
there
and
sir
pen
and
some
of
the
brethren
of
the
trinity
house
to
attend
i
did
go
in
with
them
and
it
was
to
be
informed
of
the
practice
heretofore
for
all
foreign
nations
at
enmity
one
with
another
to
forbear
any
acts
of
hostility
to
one
another
in
the
presence
of
any
of
the
king
of
england
ships
of
which
several
instances
were
given
and
it
is
referred
to
their
further
enquiry
in
order
to
the
giving
instructions
accordingly
to
our
ships
now
during
the
war
between
spain
and
france
would
to
god
we
were
in
the
same
condition
as
heretofore
to
challenge
and
maintain
this
our
dominion
thence
with
pen
homeward
and
quite
through
to
mile
end
for
a
little
ayre
the
days
being
now
pretty
long
but
the
ways
mighty
dirty
going
back
again
sir
brookes
overtook
us
coming
to
town
who
played
the
jacke
with
us
all
and
is
a
fellow
that
i
must
trust
no
more
he
quoting
me
for
all
he
hath
said
in
this
business
of
tickets
though
i
have
told
him
nothing
that
either
is
not
true
or
i
afraid
to
own
but
here
talking
he
did
discourse
in
this
stile
we
and
we
all
along
will
not
give
any
money
be
the
pretence
never
so
great
nay
though
the
enemy
was
in
the
river
of
thames
again
till
we
know
what
is
become
of
the
last
money
given
and
i
do
believe
he
do
speak
the
mind
of
his
fellows
and
so
let
him
this
evening
my
wife
did
with
great
pleasure
show
me
her
stock
of
jewells
encreased
by
the
ring
she
hath
made
lately
as
my
valentine
gift
this
year
a
turky
stone
set
with
diamonds
and
with
this
and
what
she
had
she
reckons
that
she
hath
above
worth
of
jewells
of
one
kind
or
other
and
i
am
glad
of
it
for
it
is
fit
the
wretch
should
have
something
to
content
herself
with
meeting
gibbons
christopher
gibbons
organist
to
the
king
and
of
westminster
abbey
he
was
admitted
doctor
of
music
at
oxford
and
died
he
and
i
to
see
an
organ
at
the
dean
of
westminster
lodgings
at
the
abby
the
bishop
of
rochester
john
dolben
afterwards
translated
to
york
where
he
lives
like
a
great
prelate
his
lodgings
being
very
good
though
at
present
under
great
disgrace
at
court
being
put
by
his
clerks
of
the
closet
place
i
saw
his
lady
of
whom
the
terroe
filius
of
oxford
was
once
so
merry
and
two
children
whereof
one
a
very
pretty
little
boy
like
him
so
fat
and
black
here
i
saw
the
organ
but
it
is
too
big
for
my
house
and
the
fashion
do
not
please
me
enough
and
therefore
i
will
not
have
it
to
the
nursery
where
none
of
us
ever
were
before
where
the
house
is
better
and
the
musique
better
than
we
looked
for
and
the
acting
not
much
worse
because
i
expected
as
bad
as
could
be
and
i
was
not
much
mistaken
for
it
was
so
i
was
prettily
served
this
day
at
the
where
giving
six
shillings
into
the
fellow
hand
for
three
of
us
the
fellow
by
legerdemain
did
convey
one
away
and
with
so
much
grace
faced
me
down
that
i
did
give
him
but
five
that
though
i
knew
the
contrary
yet
i
was
overpowered
by
his
so
grave
and
serious
demanding
the
other
shilling
that
i
could
not
deny
him
but
was
forced
by
myself
to
give
it
him
to
westminster
hall
where
it
being
now
about
six
i
find
the
house
just
risen
and
met
with
sir
coventry
and
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
they
having
sat
all
day
and
with
great
difficulty
have
got
a
vote
for
giving
the
king
not
to
be
raised
by
any
the
sum
is
much
smaller
than
i
expected
and
than
the
king
needs
but
is
grounded
upon
wren
reading
our
estimates
the
other
day
of
to
keep
the
fleet
abroad
wherein
we
demanded
nothing
for
setting
and
fitting
of
them
out
which
will
cost
almost
i
do
verily
believe
and
do
believe
that
the
king
hath
no
cause
to
thank
wren
for
this
motion
i
home
to
sir
coventry
lodgings
with
him
and
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
where
also
was
sir
john
coventry
and
sir
john
duncomb
and
sir
job
charleton
for
ludlow
and
in
elected
speaker
which
office
he
resigned
on
account
of
ill
health
he
was
successively
king
serjeant
chief
justice
of
chester
and
a
justice
of
the
common
pleas
created
a
baronet
and
ob
and
here
a
great
deal
of
good
discourse
and
they
seem
mighty
glad
to
have
this
vote
pass
which
i
did
wonder
at
to
see
them
so
well
satisfied
with
so
small
a
sum
sir
john
duncomb
swearing
as
i
perceive
he
will
freely
do
that
it
was
as
much
as
the
nation
could
beare
with
my
wife
to
the
king
house
to
see
the
virgin
martyr
a
tragedy
by
massinger
the
first
time
it
hath
been
acted
a
great
while
and
it
is
mighty
pleasant
not
that
the
play
is
worth
much
but
it
is
finely
acted
by
beck
marshall
but
that
which
did
please
me
beyond
any
thing
in
the
whole
world
was
the
when
the
angel
comes
down
which
is
so
sweet
that
it
ravished
me
and
indeed
in
a
word
did
wrap
up
my
soul
so
that
it
made
me
really
sick
just
as
i
have
formerly
been
when
in
love
with
my
wife
that
neither
then
nor
all
the
evening
going
home
and
at
home
i
was
able
to
think
of
any
thing
but
remained
all
night
transported
so
as
i
could
not
believe
that
ever
any
musique
hath
that
real
command
over
the
soul
of
a
man
as
this
did
upon
me
and
makes
me
resolve
to
practice
and
to
make
my
wife
do
the
like
after
dinner
with
sir
pen
to
white
hall
where
we
and
the
rest
of
us
presented
a
great
letter
of
the
state
of
our
want
of
money
to
his
royal
highness
i
did
also
present
a
demand
of
mine
for
consideration
for
my
of
coach
and
during
the
war
which
although
his
royal
highness
and
the
company
did
all
like
of
yet
contrary
to
my
expectation
i
find
him
so
jealous
now
of
doing
any
thing
extraordinary
that
he
desired
the
gentlemen
that
they
would
consider
it
and
report
their
minds
in
it
to
him
this
did
unsettle
my
mind
a
great
while
not
expecting
this
stop
but
however
i
shall
do
as
well
i
know
though
it
causes
me
a
little
stop
but
that
that
troubles
me
most
is
that
while
we
were
thus
together
with
the
duke
of
york
comes
in
wren
from
the
house
where
he
tells
us
another
storm
hath
been
all
this
day
almost
against
the
officers
of
the
navy
upon
this
complaint
that
though
they
have
made
good
rules
for
payment
of
tickets
yet
that
they
have
not
observed
them
themselves
which
was
driven
so
high
as
to
have
it
urged
that
we
should
presently
be
put
out
of
our
places
and
so
they
have
at
last
ordered
that
we
shall
be
heard
at
the
bar
of
the
house
upon
this
business
on
thursday
next
this
did
mightily
trouble
me
and
us
all
but
me
particularly
who
am
least
able
to
bear
these
troubles
though
i
have
the
least
cause
to
be
concerned
in
it
thence
therefore
to
visit
sir
cholmly
who
hath
for
some
time
been
ill
of
a
cold
and
thence
walked
towards
westminster
and
met
colonell
birch
who
took
me
back
to
walk
with
him
and
did
give
me
an
account
of
this
day
heat
against
the
and
an
account
of
his
speech
on
our
behalf
which
was
very
good
and
indeed
we
are
much
beholden
to
him
as
i
after
i
parted
with
him
did
find
by
my
cosen
roger
whom
i
went
to
and
he
and
i
to
his
lodgings
and
there
he
did
tell
me
the
same
over
again
and
how
birch
did
stand
up
in
our
defence
and
that
he
do
see
that
there
are
many
desirous
to
have
us
out
of
the
office
and
the
house
is
so
furious
and
passionate
that
he
thinks
nobody
can
be
secure
let
him
deserve
never
so
well
but
now
he
tells
me
we
shall
have
a
fair
hearing
of
the
house
and
he
hopes
justice
of
them
but
upon
the
whole
he
do
agree
with
me
that
i
should
hold
my
hand
as
to
making
any
purchase
of
land
which
i
had
formerly
discoursed
with
him
about
till
we
see
a
little
further
how
matters
go
he
tells
me
that
what
made
them
so
mad
first
was
several
letters
in
the
house
about
the
fanatickes
in
several
places
coming
in
great
bodies
and
turning
people
out
of
the
churches
and
there
preaching
themselves
and
pulling
the
surplice
over
the
parsons
heads
this
was
confirmed
from
several
places
which
makes
them
stark
mad
especially
the
hectors
and
bravadoes
of
the
house
who
show
all
the
zeal
on
this
occasion
they
tell
me
how
sir
thomas
allen
hath
taken
the
englishmen
out
of
la
roche
ship
and
taken
from
him
an
ostend
prize
which
la
roche
had
fetched
out
of
our
harbours
and
at
this
day
la
roche
keeps
upon
our
coasts
and
had
the
boldness
to
land
some
men
and
go
a
mile
up
into
the
country
and
there
took
some
goods
belonging
to
this
prize
out
of
a
house
there
which
our
king
resents
and
they
say
hath
wrote
to
the
king
of
france
about
and
every
body
do
think
a
war
will
follow
and
then
in
what
a
case
we
shall
be
for
want
of
money
nobody
knows
wrote
to
my
father
and
sent
him
colvill
note
for
for
my
sister
portion
march
lord
day
up
very
betimes
and
by
coach
to
sir
coventry
and
there
largely
carrying
with
me
all
my
notes
and
papers
did
run
over
our
whole
defence
in
the
business
of
tickets
in
order
to
the
answering
the
house
on
thursday
next
and
i
do
think
unless
they
be
set
without
reason
to
ruin
us
we
shall
make
a
good
defence
i
find
him
in
great
anxiety
though
he
will
not
discover
it
in
the
business
of
the
proceedings
of
parliament
and
would
as
little
as
is
possible
have
his
name
mentioned
in
our
discourse
to
them
and
particularly
the
business
of
selling
places
is
now
upon
his
hand
to
defend
himself
in
wherein
i
did
help
him
in
his
defence
about
the
place
which
is
named
in
the
house
we
did
here
do
the
like
about
the
complaint
of
want
of
victuals
in
the
fleet
in
the
year
which
will
lie
upon
me
to
defend
also
moore
was
with
me
and
do
tell
me
and
so
hewer
tells
me
he
hears
this
morning
that
all
the
town
is
full
of
the
discourse
that
the
officers
of
the
navy
shall
be
all
turned
out
but
honest
sir
john
minnes
who
god
knows
is
fitter
to
have
been
turned
out
himself
than
any
of
us
doing
the
king
more
hurt
by
his
dotage
and
folly
than
all
the
rest
can
do
by
their
knavery
if
they
had
a
mind
to
it
this
day
i
have
the
news
that
my
sister
was
married
on
thursday
last
to
jackson
so
that
work
is
i
hope
well
over
up
betimes
to
work
again
and
then
met
at
the
office
where
to
our
great
business
of
this
answer
to
the
parliament
where
to
my
great
vexation
i
find
my
lord
brouncker
prepared
only
to
excuse
himself
while
i
that
have
least
reason
to
trouble
myself
am
preparing
with
great
pains
to
defend
them
all
and
more
i
perceive
he
would
lodge
the
beginning
of
discharging
ships
by
ticket
upon
me
but
i
care
not
for
i
believe
i
shall
get
more
honour
by
it
when
the
parliament
against
my
will
shall
see
how
the
whole
business
of
the
office
was
done
by
me
down
by
water
to
deptford
where
the
king
queene
and
court
are
to
see
launched
the
new
ship
built
by
shish
called
the
charles
god
send
her
better
luck
than
the
former
here
some
of
our
brethren
who
went
in
a
boat
a
little
before
my
boat
did
by
appointment
take
opportunity
of
asking
the
king
leave
that
we
might
make
full
use
of
the
want
of
money
in
our
excuse
to
the
parliament
for
the
business
of
tickets
and
other
things
they
will
lay
to
our
charge
all
which
arise
from
nothing
else
and
this
the
king
did
readily
agree
to
and
did
give
us
leave
to
make
our
full
use
of
it
the
ship
being
well
launched
i
back
again
by
boat
to
westminster
where
i
found
myself
come
time
enough
and
my
brethren
all
ready
but
i
full
of
thoughts
and
trouble
touching
the
issue
of
this
day
and
to
comfort
myself
did
go
to
the
dog
and
drink
of
mulled
sack
and
in
the
hall
did
drink
a
dram
of
brandy
at
hewlett
and
with
the
warmth
of
this
did
find
myself
in
better
order
as
to
courage
truly
so
we
all
up
to
the
lobby
and
between
eleven
and
twelve
were
called
in
with
the
mace
before
us
into
the
house
where
a
mighty
full
house
and
we
stood
at
the
bar
namely
brouncker
sir
minnes
sir
harvey
and
myself
pen
being
in
the
house
as
a
member
i
perceive
the
whole
house
was
full
of
expectation
of
our
defence
what
it
would
be
and
with
great
prejudice
after
the
speaker
had
told
us
the
dissatisfaction
of
the
house
and
read
the
report
of
the
committee
i
began
our
defence
most
acceptably
and
smoothly
and
continued
at
it
without
any
hesitation
or
losse
but
with
full
scope
and
all
my
reason
free
about
me
as
if
it
had
been
at
my
own
table
from
that
time
till
past
three
in
the
afternoon
and
so
ended
without
any
interruption
from
the
speaker
but
we
withdrew
and
there
all
my
fellow
officers
and
all
the
world
that
was
within
hearing
did
congratulate
me
and
cry
up
my
speech
as
the
best
thing
they
ever
heard
and
my
were
overjoyed
in
it
and
we
were
called
in
again
by
and
by
to
answer
only
one
question
touching
our
paying
tickets
to
and
so
out
and
we
were
in
hopes
to
have
had
a
vote
this
day
in
our
favour
and
so
the
generality
of
the
house
was
but
my
speech
being
so
long
many
had
gone
out
to
dinner
and
come
in
again
and
then
there
are
two
or
three
that
are
professed
enemies
to
us
and
every
body
else
among
others
sir
littleton
sir
thomas
lee
of
hartwell
bucks
created
a
baronet
wiles
the
coxcomb
whom
i
saw
heretofore
at
the
and
a
few
others
i
say
these
did
rise
up
and
speak
against
the
coming
to
a
vote
now
the
house
not
being
full
by
reason
of
several
being
at
dinner
but
most
because
that
the
house
was
to
attend
the
king
this
afternoon
about
the
business
of
religion
wherein
they
pray
him
to
in
force
all
the
laws
against
nonconformists
and
papists
and
this
prevented
it
so
that
they
put
it
off
to
come
however
it
is
plain
we
have
got
great
ground
and
every
body
says
i
have
got
the
most
honour
that
any
could
have
had
opportunity
of
getting
and
so
our
hearts
mightily
overjoyed
at
this
success
after
dinner
to
the
king
house
and
there
saw
part
of
the
discontented
colonell
brennoralt
or
the
discontented
colonel
a
tragedy
by
sir
john
suckling
up
betimes
and
with
sir
gauden
to
sir
chamber
where
the
first
word
he
said
to
me
was
pepys
that
must
be
speaker
of
the
and
did
protest
i
had
got
honour
for
ever
in
parliament
he
said
that
his
brother
that
sat
by
him
admires
me
and
another
gentleman
said
that
i
could
not
get
less
than
if
i
would
put
on
a
gown
and
plead
at
the
but
what
pleases
me
most
he
tells
me
that
the
did
protest
that
he
thought
i
spoke
the
best
of
any
man
in
england
after
several
talks
with
him
alone
touching
his
own
businesses
he
carried
me
to
white
hall
and
there
parted
and
i
to
the
duke
of
lodgings
and
find
him
going
to
the
parke
it
being
a
very
fine
morning
and
i
after
him
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
told
me
with
great
satisfaction
that
i
had
converted
a
great
many
yesterday
and
did
with
great
praise
of
me
go
on
with
the
discourse
with
me
and
by
and
by
overtaking
the
king
the
king
and
duke
of
york
came
to
me
both
and
he
the
king
said
pepys
i
am
very
glad
of
your
success
yesterday
and
fell
to
talk
of
my
well
speaking
and
many
of
the
lords
there
my
lord
barkeley
did
cry
me
up
for
what
they
had
heard
of
it
and
others
there
about
the
king
did
say
that
they
never
heard
such
a
speech
in
their
lives
delivered
in
that
manner
progers
of
the
bedchamber
swore
to
me
afterwards
before
brouncker
in
the
afternoon
that
he
did
tell
the
king
that
he
thought
i
might
match
the
every
body
that
saw
me
almost
came
to
me
as
joseph
williamson
and
others
with
such
eulogys
as
can
not
be
expressed
from
thence
i
went
to
westminster
hall
where
i
met
montagu
who
came
to
me
and
kissed
me
and
told
me
that
he
had
often
heretofore
kissed
my
hands
but
now
he
would
kiss
my
lips
protesting
that
i
was
another
cicero
and
said
all
the
world
said
the
same
of
me
ashburnham
and
every
creature
i
met
there
of
the
parliament
or
that
knew
any
thing
of
the
parliament
actings
did
salute
me
with
this
honour
godolphin
sands
who
swore
he
would
go
twenty
miles
at
any
time
to
hear
the
like
again
and
that
he
never
saw
so
many
sit
four
hours
together
to
hear
any
man
in
his
life
as
there
did
to
hear
me
chichly
sir
john
duncomb
and
every
body
do
say
that
the
kingdom
will
ring
of
my
abilities
and
that
i
have
done
myself
right
for
my
whole
life
and
so
captain
cocke
and
others
of
my
friends
say
that
no
man
had
ever
such
an
opportunity
of
making
his
abilities
known
and
that
i
may
cite
all
at
once
mr
lieutenant
of
the
tower
did
tell
me
that
vaughan
did
protest
to
him
and
that
in
his
hearing
it
said
so
to
the
duke
of
albemarle
and
afterwards
to
sir
coventry
that
he
had
sat
years
in
parliament
and
never
heard
such
a
speech
there
before
for
which
the
lord
god
make
me
thankful
and
that
i
may
make
use
of
it
not
to
pride
and
but
that
now
i
have
this
esteem
i
may
do
nothing
that
may
lessen
it
to
white
hall
to
wait
on
the
duke
of
york
where
he
again
and
all
the
company
magnified
me
and
several
in
the
gallery
among
others
my
lord
gerard
who
never
knew
me
before
nor
spoke
to
me
desires
his
being
better
acquainted
with
me
and
that
at
table
where
he
was
he
never
heard
so
much
said
of
any
man
as
of
me
in
his
whole
life
so
waited
on
the
duke
of
york
and
thence
into
the
gallery
where
the
house
of
lords
waited
the
coming
out
of
the
park
which
he
did
by
and
by
and
there
in
the
my
lord
keeper
delivered
a
message
to
the
king
the
lords
being
about
him
wherein
the
barons
of
england
from
many
good
arguments
very
well
expressed
in
the
part
he
read
out
of
do
demand
precedence
in
england
of
all
noblemen
of
either
of
the
king
other
two
kingdoms
be
their
title
what
it
will
and
did
show
that
they
were
in
england
reputed
but
as
commoners
and
sat
in
the
house
of
commons
and
at
conferences
with
the
lords
did
stand
bare
it
was
mighty
worth
my
hearing
but
the
king
did
say
only
that
he
would
consider
of
it
and
so
dismissed
them
with
sir
coventry
who
i
find
full
of
care
in
his
own
business
how
to
defend
himself
against
those
that
have
a
mind
to
cheque
him
and
though
i
believe
not
for
honour
and
for
the
keeping
his
employment
but
for
safety
and
reputation
sake
is
desirous
to
preserve
himself
free
from
blame
by
coach
to
white
hall
and
there
met
lord
brouncker
and
he
and
i
to
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
where
i
find
them
mighty
kind
to
me
more
i
think
than
was
wont
and
here
i
also
met
colvill
the
goldsmith
who
tells
me
with
great
joy
how
the
world
upon
the
talks
of
me
and
how
several
men
viz
boscawen
edward
boscawen
for
truro
and
major
walden
of
huntingdon
who
it
seems
do
deal
with
him
do
say
how
bravely
i
did
speak
and
that
the
house
was
ready
to
have
given
me
thanks
for
it
but
that
i
think
is
a
vanity
with
sir
gauden
homewards
calling
at
lincolne
fields
but
my
lady
jemimah
was
not
within
and
so
to
newgate
where
he
stopped
to
give
directions
to
the
jaylor
about
a
knight
one
sir
thomas
halford
of
welham
leicestershire
baronet
brought
in
yesterday
for
killing
one
colonell
temple
falling
out
at
a
taverne
home
and
there
comes
moore
to
me
who
tells
me
that
he
fears
my
lord
sandwich
will
meet
with
very
great
difficulties
to
go
through
about
the
prizes
it
being
found
that
he
did
give
orders
for
more
than
the
king
letter
do
justify
and
then
for
the
act
of
resumption
which
he
fears
will
go
on
and
is
designed
only
to
do
him
hurt
which
troubles
me
much
he
tells
me
he
believes
the
parliament
will
not
be
brought
to
do
any
thing
in
matters
of
religion
but
will
adhere
to
the
bishops
meeting
colvill
i
walked
with
him
to
his
building
where
he
is
building
a
fine
house
where
he
formerly
lived
in
and
it
will
be
a
very
fine
street
so
to
westminster
and
there
walked
till
by
and
by
comes
sir
coventry
and
with
him
chichly
and
andrew
newport
i
to
dinner
with
them
to
chichly
in
in
covent
garden
a
very
fine
house
and
a
man
that
lives
in
mighty
great
fashion
with
all
things
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
noble
and
rich
about
him
and
eats
in
the
french
fashion
all
and
mighty
nobly
served
with
his
servants
and
very
civilly
that
i
was
mighty
pleased
with
it
and
good
discourse
he
is
a
great
defender
of
the
church
of
england
and
against
the
act
for
comprehension
which
is
the
work
of
this
day
about
which
the
house
is
like
to
sit
till
night
after
dinner
with
them
back
to
westminster
captain
cocke
told
me
that
the
speaker
says
he
never
heard
such
a
defence
made
in
all
his
life
in
the
house
and
that
the
do
commend
me
even
to
envy
to
gresham
college
there
to
show
myself
and
was
there
greeted
by
wilkins
whistler
and
others
as
the
patron
of
the
and
one
that
got
great
fame
by
my
late
speech
to
the

of
us

myself

there
had
a
dinner

base

which
did
not
please
us
at
all
my
head

full
of
dinner

to
my
lord
crewe
there
to
invite
sir
thomas
crewe
and
there
met
with

a
beauty
nor
ugly
but

comely

very
thence
home
and
there
i
find
one
laying
of
my
napkins
against
in
figures
of
all
sorts
which
is
mighty
pretty
and
it
seems

much
money
by
it
up
very
betimes
and
with
jane

george
montagu
who

at
a
very
little
warning
which

exceeding
kind
of
him
and
there
among
other
things
my
lord
had
sir
samuel
morland
late
invention
for
casting
up
of
sums
of
which
is
very
pretty
but
not
very
useful
most
of
our
discourse
was
of
my
lord
sandwich
and
his
family
as
being
all
of
us
of
the
family
and
with
extraordinary
pleasure
all
the
afternoon
thus
together
eating
and
looking
over
my
closet
and
my
lady
hinchingbroke
i
find
a
very
and
disposed
lady
a
lover
of
books
and
pictures
and
of
good
understanding
about
five
they
went
and
then
my
wife
and
i
abroad
by
coach
into
only
for
a
little
ayre
walked
with
sir
coventry
into
the
park
and
there
met
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
and
walked
a
good
while
with
them
and
here
met
sir
jer
smith
who
tells
me
he
is
like
to
get
the
better
of
holmes
and
that
when
he
is
come
to
an
end
of
that
he
will
do
hollis
business
for
him
in
the
house
for
his
blasphemies
which
i
shall
be
glad
of
so
to
white
hall
and
there
walked
with
this
man
and
that
man
till
chapel
done
and
the
king
dined
and
then
sir
thomas
clifford
the
comptroller
took
me
with
him
to
dinner
to
his
lodgings
where
my
lord
arlington
and
a
great
deal
of
good
and
great
company
where
i
very
civilly
used
by
them
and
had
a
most
excellent
dinner
and
good
discourse
of
spain
godolphin
being
there
particularly
of
the
removal
of
the
bodies
of
all
the
dead
kings
of
spain
that
could
be
got
together
and
brought
to
the
pantheon
at
the
escuriall
when
it
was
finished
and
there
placed
before
the
altar
there
to
lie
for
ever
and
there
was
a
sermon
made
to
them
upon
this
text
arida
ossa
audite
verbum
dei
and
a
most
eloquent
sermon
as
they
say
to
the
where
i
met
ball
and
did
receive
my
paper
i
went
for
and
there
fell
in
talk
with
him
who
being
an
old
cavalier
do
swear
and
curse
at
the
present
state
of
things
that
we
should
be
brought
to
this
that
we
must
be
undone
and
can
not
be
saved
that
the
parliament
is
sitting
now
and
will
till
midnight
to
find
how
to
raise
this
and
doubts
they
will
not
do
it
so
as
to
be
seasonable
for
the
king
but
do
cry
out
against
all
our
great
men
at
court
how
it
is
a
fine
thing
for
a
secretary
of
state
to
dance
a
jigg
and
that
it
was
not
so
heretofore
and
above
all
do
curse
my
lord
of
bristoll
saying
the
worst
news
that
ever
he
heard
in
his
life
or
that
the
devil
could
ever
bring
us
was
this
lord
coming
to
prayers
the
other
day
in
the
house
of
lords
by
which
he
is
coming
about
again
from
being
a
papist
which
will
undo
this
nation
and
he
says
he
ever
did
say
at
the
king
first
coming
in
that
this
nation
could
not
be
safe
while
that
man
was
alive
the
house
i
hear
have
this
day
concluded
upon
raising
of
the
by
wine
and
the
rest
by
poll
and
have
resolved
to
excuse
the
church
in
expectation
that
they
will
do
the
more
of
themselves
at
this
juncture
and
i
do
hear
that
sir
coventry
did
make
a
speech
in
behalf
of
the
clergy
to
white
hall
where
we
and
my
lord
brouncker
attended
the
council
to
discourse
about
the
fitness
of
entering
of
men
presently
for
the
manning
of
the
fleet
before
one
ship
is
in
condition
to
receive
them
sir
coventry
did
argue
against
it
i
was
wholly
silent
because
i
saw
the
king
upon
the
earnestness
of
the
prince
was
willing
to
it
crying
very
civilly
if
ever
you
intend
to
man
the
fleet
without
being
cheated
by
the
captains
and
pursers
you
may
go
to
bed
and
resolve
never
to
have
it
manned
and
so
it
was
like
other
things
that
all
volunteers
should
be
presently
entered
then
there
was
another
great
business
about
our
signing
of
certificates
to
the
exchequer
for
goods
upon
the
act
which
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
did
all
oppose
and
to
the
laying
fault
upon
us
but
i
did
then
speak
to
the
justifying
what
we
had
done
even
to
the
angering
of
duncomb
and
clifford
which
i
was
vexed
at
but
for
all
that
i
did
set
the
office
and
myself
right
and
went
away
with
the
victory
my
lord
keeper
saying
that
he
would
not
advise
the
council
to
order
us
to
sign
more
certificates
but
before
i
began
to
say
any
thing
in
this
matter
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
talking
at
the
before
all
the
lords
of
the
committee
of
miscarriages
how
this
entering
of
men
before
the
ships
could
be
ready
would
be
reckoned
a
miscarriage
why
says
the
king
it
is
then
but
pepys
making
of
another
speech
to
them
which
made
all
the
lords
and
there
were
by
also
the
atturny
and
look
upon
me
thence
sir
coventry
pen
and
i
by
to
take
a
little
ayre
in
hyde
parke
the
first
time
that
i
have
been
there
this
year
and
we
did
meet
many
coaches
going
and
coming
it
being
mighty
pleasant
weather
and
so
coming
back
again
i
light
in
the
pell
mell
and
there
went
to
see
sir
cholmly
who
continues
very
ill
of
his
cold
and
there
came
in
sir
yelverton
and
sir
cholmly
commended
to
me
his
acquaintance
which
the
other
received
but
without
remembering
to
me
or
i
him
of
our
being
together
and
i
said
nothing
of
it
but
he
took
notice
of
my
speech
the
other
day
at
the
bar
of
the
house
and
indeed
i
perceive
he
is
a
wise
men
here
he
do
say
that
the
town
is
full
of
it
that
now
the
parliament
hath
resolved
upon
the
king
instead
of
fifty
will
set
out
but
ships
and
the
dutch
as
many
and
that
smith
is
to
command
them
who
is
allowed
to
have
the
better
of
holmes
in
the
late
dispute
and
is
in
good
esteem
in
the
parliament
above
the
other
thence
home
and
there
in
favour
to
my
eyes
staid
at
home
reading
the
ridiculous
history
of
my
lord
newcastle
wrote
by
his
wife
which
shows
her
to
be
a
mad
conceited
ridiculous
woman
and
he
an
asse
to
suffer
her
to
write
what
she
writes
to
him
and
of
him
so
to
bed
my
eyes
being
very
bad
and
i
know
not
how
in
the
world
to
abstain
from
reading
walked
all
along
which
i
have
not
done
since
it
was
burned
as
far
as
billingsgate
and
there
do
see
a
brave
street
likely
to
be
many
brave
houses
being
built
and
of
them
a
great
many
by
jaggard
but
the
raising
of
the
street
will
make
it
mighty
fine
all
the
evening
pricking
down
some
things
and
trying
some
conclusions
upon
my
viall
in
order
to
the
inventing
a
better
theory
of
musique
than
hath
yet
been
abroad
and
i
think
verily
i
shall
do
it
this
day
at
court
i
do
hear
that
sir
pen
do
command
this
summer
fleet
and
progers
of
the
bedchamber
as
a
secret
told
me
that
the
prince
rupert
is
troubled
at
it
and
several
friends
of
his
have
been
with
him
to
know
the
reason
of
it
so
that
he
do
pity
sir
pen
whom
he
hath
a
great
kindness
for
that
he
should
not
at
any
desire
of
his
be
put
to
this
service
and
thereby
make
the
prince
his
enemy
and
contract
more
envy
from
other
people
from
the
duke
chamber
sir
coventry
and
i
to
walk
in
the
mattted
gallery
and
there
among
other
things
he
tells
me
of
the
wicked
design
that
now
is
at
last
contriving
against
him
to
get
a
petition
presented
from
people
that
the
money
they
have
paid
to
sir
coventry
for
their
places
may
be
repaid
them
back
and
that
this
is
set
on
by
temple
and
hollis
of
the
parliament
and
among
other
mean
people
in
it
by
captain
tatnell
and
he
prays
me
that
i
will
use
some
effectual
way
to
sift
tatnell
what
he
do
and
who
puts
him
on
in
this
business
which
i
do
undertake
and
will
do
with
all
my
skill
for
his
service
being
troubled
that
he
is
still
under
this
difficulty
thence
back
to
white
hall
where
great
talk
of
the
tumult
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
about
among
the
prentices
taking
the
liberty
of
these
holydays
to
pull
down
brothels
and
lord
to
see
the
apprehensions
which
this
did
give
to
all
people
at
court
that
presently
order
was
given
for
all
the
soldiers
horse
and
foot
to
be
in
armes
and
forthwith
alarmes
were
beat
by
drum
and
trumpet
through
westminster
and
all
to
their
colours
and
to
horse
as
if
the
french
were
coming
into
the
town
so
creed
whom
i
met
here
and
i
to
lincolne
thinking
to
have
come
into
the
fields
to
have
seen
the
prentices
but
here
we
found
these
fields
full
of
soldiers
all
in
a
body
and
my
lord
craven
commanding
of
them
and
riding
up
and
down
to
give
orders
like
a
madman
and
some
young
men
we
saw
brought
by
soldiers
to
the
guard
at
white
hall
and
overheard
others
that
stood
by
say
that
it
was
only
for
pulling
down
the
brothels
and
none
of
the
bystanders
finding
fault
with
them
but
rather
of
the
soldiers
for
hindering
them
and
we
heard
a
justice
of
peace
this
morning
say
to
the
king
that
he
had
been
endeavouring
to
suppress
this
tumult
but
could
not
and
that
imprisoning
some
of
them
in
the
new
prison
at
clerkenwell
the
rest
did
come
and
break
open
the
prison
and
release
them
and
that
they
do
give
out
that
they
are
for
pulling
down
the
brothels
which
is
one
of
the
great
grievances
of
the
nation
to
which
the
king
made
a
very
poor
cold
insipid
answer
why
why
do
they
go
to
them
then
and
that
was
all
and
had
no
mind
to
go
on
with
the
discourse
this
evening
i
came
home
from
white
hall
with
sir
pen
who
fell
in
talk
about
his
going
to
sea
this
year
and
the
difficulties
that
arise
to
him
by
it
by
giving
offence
to
the
prince
and
occasioning
envy
to
him
and
many
other
things
that
make
it
a
bad
matter
at
this
time
of
want
of
money
and
necessaries
and
bad
and
uneven
counsels
at
home
for
him
to
go
abroad
and
did
tell
me
how
much
with
the
king
and
duke
of
york
he
had
endeavoured
to
be
excused
desiring
the
prince
might
be
satisfied
in
it
who
hath
a
mind
to
go
but
he
tells
me
they
will
not
excuse
him
and
i
believe
it
and
truly
do
judge
it
a
piece
of
bad
fortune
to
pen
up
and
walked
to
white
hall
there
to
wait
on
the
duke
of
york
which
i
did
and
in
his
chamber
there
first
by
hearing
the
duke
of
york
call
me
by
my
name
my
lord
burlington
did
come
to
me
and
with
great
respect
take
notice
of
me
and
my
relation
to
my
lord
sandwich
and
express
great
kindness
to
me
and
so
to
talk
of
my
lord
sandwich
concernments
by
and
by
the
duke
of
york
is
ready
and
i
did
wait
for
an
opportunity
of
speaking
my
mind
to
him
about
sir
minnes
his
being
unable
to
do
the
king
any
service
the
duke
of
york
and
all
with
him
this
morning
were
full
of
the
talk
of
the
prentices
who
are
not
yet
put
down
though
the
guards
and
militia
of
the
town
have
been
in
armes
all
this
night
and
the
night
before
and
the
prentices
have
made
fools
of
them
sometimes
by
running
from
them
and
flinging
stones
at
them
some
blood
hath
been
spilt
but
a
great
many
houses
pulled
down
and
among
others
the
duke
of
york
was
mighty
merry
at
that
of
daman
page
the
great
bawd
of
the
seamen
and
the
duke
of
york
complained
merrily
that
he
hath
lost
two
tenants
by
their
houses
being
pulled
down
who
paid
him
for
their
licences
but
these
idle
fellows
have
had
the
confidence
to
say
that
they
did
ill
in
contenting
themselves
in
pulling
down
the
little
brothels
and
did
not
go
and
pull
down
the
great
one
at
white
hall
and
some
of
them
have
the
last
night
had
a
word
among
them
and
it
was
reformation
and
reducement
this
do
make
the
courtiers
ill
at
ease
to
see
this
spirit
among
people
though
they
think
this
matter
will
not
come
to
much
but
it
speakes
people
minds
and
then
they
do
say
that
there
are
men
of
understanding
among
them
that
have
been
of
cromwell
army
but
how
true
that
is
i
know
not
to
the
duke
of
york
house
to
see
the
new
play
called
the
man
is
the
master
a
comedy
by
sir
wm
davenant
taken
from
moliere
joddelet
where
the
house
was
it
being
not
one
very
full
by
and
by
the
king
came
and
we
sat
just
under
him
so
that
i
durst
not
turn
my
back
all
the
play
the
most
of
the
mirth
was
sorry
poor
stuffe
of
eating
of
sack
posset
and
slabbering
themselves
and
mirth
fit
for
clownes
the
prologue
but
poor
and
the
epilogue
little
in
it
but
the
extraordinariness
of
it
it
being
sung
by
harris
and
another
in
the
form
of
a
ballet
my
wife
extraordinary
fine
in
her
flower
tabby
suit
bought
a
year
and
more
ago
before
my
death
put
her
into
mourning
and
so
not
worn
till
this
day
and
every
body
in
love
with
it
and
indeed
she
is
very
fine
and
handsome
in
it
home
in
a
coach
round
by
the
wall
where
we
met
so
many
stops
by
the
watches
that
it
cost
us
much
time
and
some
trouble
and
more
money
to
every
watch
to
them
to
drink
this
being
encreased
by
the
trouble
the
prentices
did
lately
give
the
city
so
that
the
militia
and
watches
are
very
strict
at
this
time
and
we
had
like
to
have
met
with
a
stop
for
all
night
at
the
constable
watch
at
mooregate
by
a
pragmatical
constable
but
we
came
well
home
at
about
two
in
the
morning
this
noon
from
williams
my
lord
brouncker
sent
to
somerset
house
to
hear
how
the
duchesse
of
richmond
do
and
word
was
brought
him
that
she
is
pretty
well
but
mighty
full
of
the
small
pox
by
which
all
do
conclude
she
will
he
wholly
spoiled
which
is
the
greatest
instance
of
the
uncertainty
of
beauty
that
could
be
in
this
age
but
then
she
hath
had
the
benefit
of
it
to
be
first
married
and
to
have
kept
it
so
long
under
the
greatest
temptations
in
the
world
from
a
king
and
yet
without
the
least
imputation
this
afternoon
at
the
play
sir
fr
hollis
spoke
to
me
as
a
secret
and
matter
of
confidence
in
me
and
friendship
to
sir
pen
who
is
now
out
of
town
that
it
were
well
he
were
made
acquainted
that
he
finds
in
the
house
of
commons
which
met
this
day
several
motions
made
for
the
calling
strictly
again
upon
the
miscarriages
and
particularly
in
the
business
of
the
prizes
and
the
not
prosecuting
of
the
first
victory
only
to
give
an
affront
to
sir
pen
whose
going
to
sea
this
year
does
give
them
matter
of
great
dislike
this
day
at
noon
comes
pelling
to
me
and
shows
me
the
stone
cut
lately
out
of
sir
thomas
adams
the
old
comely
alderman
body
knight
and
bart
alderman
of
london
ob
he
founded
an
arabic
professorship
at
cambridge
which
is
very
large
indeed
bigger
i
think
than
my
fist
and
weighs
above
ounces
and
which
is
very
miraculous
he
never
in
all
his
life
had
any
fit
of
it
but
lived
to
a
great
age
without
pain
and
died
at
last
of
something
else
without
any
sense
of
this
in
all
his
life
this
day
creed
at
white
hall
in
discourse
told
me
what
information
he
hath
had
from
very
good
hands
of
the
cowardize
and
of
sir
jer
smith
and
sir
thomas
allen
and
the
repute
they
have
both
of
them
abroad
in
the
streights
from
their
deportment
when
they
did
at
several
times
command
there
and
that
above
all
englishmen
that
ever
were
there
there
never
was
any
man
that
behaved
himself
like
poor
charles
wager
whom
the
very
moores
do
mention
with
tears
sometimes
to
church
and
there
did
first
find
a
strange
reader
who
could
not
find
in
the
the
place
for
churching
women
but
was
fain
to
change
books
with
the
clerke
and
then
a
stranger
preached
a
seeming
able
man
but
said
in
his
pulpit
that
god
did
a
greater
work
in
raising
of
an
from
an
acorn
than
a
man
body
raising
it
at
the
last
day
from
his
dust
showing
the
possibility
of
the
resurrection
which
was
methought
a
strange
saying
harris
do
so
commend
my
picture
of
hales
that
i
shall
have
him
draw
harris
head
and
he
hath
also
persuaded
me
to
have
cooper
draw
my
wife
which
though
it
cost
yet
i
will
have
done
i
do
hear
by
several
that
sir
pen
going
to
sea
do
dislike
the
parliament
mightily
and
that
they
have
revived
the
committee
of
miscarriages
to
find
something
to
prevent
it
and
that
he
being
the
other
day
with
the
duke
of
albemarle
to
ask
his
opinion
touching
his
going
to
sea
the
duchesse
overheard
and
came
in
to
him
and
asked
pen
how
he
durst
have
the
confidence
to
offer
to
go
to
sea
again
to
the
endangering
the
nation
when
he
knew
himself
such
a
coward
as
he
was
which
if
true
is
very
severe
by
coach
to
where
by
appointment
i
was
to
meet
harris
which
i
did
and
also
cooper
the
great
painter
and
hales
and
thence
presently
to
cooper
house
to
see
some
of
his
work
which
is
all
in
little
but
so
excellent
as
though
i
must
confess
i
do
think
the
colouring
of
the
flesh
to
be
a
little
forced
yet
the
painting
is
so
extraordinary
as
i
do
never
expect
to
see
the
like
again
here
i
did
see
stewart
picture
as
when
a
young
maid
and
now
just
done
before
her
having
the
and
it
would
make
a
man
weep
to
see
what
she
was
then
and
what
she
is
like
to
be
by
people
discourse
now
here
i
saw
my
lord
picture
and
my
lord
arlington
and
ashly
and
several
others
but
among
the
rest
one
swinfen
that
was
secretary
to
my
lord
manchester
lord
chamberlain
with
cooling
done
so
admirably
as
i
never
saw
any
thing
but
the
misery
was
this
fellow
died
in
debt
and
never
paid
cooper
for
his
picture
but
it
being
seized
on
by
his
creditors
among
his
other
goods
after
his
death
cooper
himself
says
that
he
did
buy
it
and
give
out
of
his
purse
for
it
for
what
he
was
to
have
had
but
to
white
hall
and
westminster
where
i
find
the
parliament
still
bogling
about
the
raising
of
this
money
and
every
body
mouth
full
now
and
wren
himself
tells
me
that
the
duke
of
york
declares
to
go
to
sea
himself
this
year
and
i
perceive
it
is
only
on
this
occasion
of
distaste
of
the
parliament
against
pen
going
and
to
prevent
the
prince
but
i
think
it
is
mighty
hot
counsel
for
the
duke
of
york
at
this
time
to
go
out
of
the
way
but
lord
what
pass
are
all
our
matters
come
to
at
noon
by
appointment
to
in
to
meet
captain
cocke
and
some
other
creditors
the
navy
and
their
counsel
pemberton
north
offly
and
charles
porter
and
there
dined
and
talked
of
the
business
of
the
assignments
on
the
exchequer
of
the
on
behalf
of
our
creditors
and
there
i
do
perceive
that
the
counsel
had
heard
of
my
performance
in
the
lately
and
did
value
me
and
what
i
said
accordingly
at
dinner
we
had
a
great
deal
of
good
discourse
about
parliament
their
number
being
uncertain
and
always
at
the
will
of
the
king
to
encrease
as
he
saw
reason
to
erect
a
new
borough
but
all
concluded
that
the
bane
of
the
parliament
hath
been
the
leaving
off
the
old
custom
of
the
places
allowing
wages
to
those
that
served
them
in
parliament
by
which
they
chose
men
that
understood
their
business
and
would
attend
it
and
they
could
expect
an
account
from
which
now
they
can
not
and
so
the
parliament
is
become
a
company
of
men
unable
to
give
account
for
the
interest
of
the
place
they
serve
for
thence
the
meeting
of
the
counsel
with
the
king
counsel
this
afternoon
being
put
off
by
reason
of
the
death
of
serjeant
maynard
lady
john
maynard
an
eminent
lawyer
made
serjeant
to
cromwell
in
and
afterwards
king
serjeant
by
charles
who
knighted
him
in
he
was
chosen
member
for
berealston
and
sat
in
every
parliament
till
the
revolution
ob
aged
i
to
white
hall
where
the
parliament
was
to
wait
on
the
king
and
they
did
and
he
did
think
fit
to
tell
them
that
they
might
expect
to
be
adjourned
at
whitsuntide
and
that
they
might
make
haste
to
raise
their
money
but
this
i
fear
will
displease
them
who
did
expect
to
sit
as
long
as
they
pleased
april
with
lord
brouncker
to
the
royall
society
where
they
had
just
done
but
there
i
was
forced
to
subscribe
to
the
building
of
a
college
and
did
give
and
several
others
did
subscribe
some
greater
and
some
less
sums
but
several
i
saw
hang
off
and
i
doubt
it
will
spoil
the
society
for
it
breeds
faction
and
and
becomes
burdensome
to
some
that
can
not
or
would
not
do
it
as
soon
as
we
had
done
with
the
duke
of
york
we
did
attend
the
council
and
were
there
called
in
and
did
hear
sollicitor
make
his
report
to
the
council
in
the
business
of
a
complaint
against
us
for
having
prepared
certificates
on
the
exchequer
for
the
further
sum
of
which
he
did
in
a
most
excellent
manner
of
words
but
most
cruelly
severe
against
us
and
so
were
some
of
the
lords
commissioners
of
the
treasury
as
men
guilty
of
a
practice
with
the
tradesmen
to
the
prejudice
i
was
unwilling
to
enter
into
a
contest
with
them
but
took
advantage
of
two
or
three
words
last
spoke
and
brought
it
to
a
short
issue
in
good
words
that
if
we
had
the
order
to
hold
our
hands
we
would
which
did
end
the
matter
and
they
all
resolved
we
should
have
it
and
so
it
ended
and
so
we
away
i
vexed
that
i
did
not
speak
more
in
a
cause
so
fit
to
be
spoke
in
and
wherein
we
had
so
much
advantage
but
perhaps
i
might
have
provoked
the
sollicitor
and
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
and
therefore
since
i
am
not
sorry
that
i
forebore
this
day
i
hear
that
prince
rupert
and
holmes
do
go
to
sea
and
by
this
there
is
a
seeming
friendship
and
peace
among
our
great
seamen
but
the
devil
a
bit
there
is
any
love
among
them
or
can
be
i
did
attend
the
duke
of
york
and
he
did
carry
us
to
the
king
lodgings
but
he
was
asleep
in
his
closet
so
we
stayed
in
the
where
the
duke
of
york
did
tell
us
what
rules
he
had
of
knowing
the
weather
and
did
now
tell
us
we
should
have
rain
before
it
having
been
a
dry
season
for
some
time
and
so
it
did
rain
all
night
almost
and
pretty
rules
he
hath
and
told
brouncker
and
me
some
of
them
which
were
such
as
no
reason
can
readily
be
given
for
them
by
and
by
the
king
comes
out
and
then
to
talk
of
other
things
about
the
quakers
not
swearing
and
how
they
do
swear
in
the
business
of
a
late
election
of
a
knight
of
the
shire
of
hartfordshire
in
behalf
of
one
they
have
a
mind
to
have
and
how
my
lord
of
pembroke
says
he
hath
heard
the
quaker
at
the
swear
to
himself
when
he
loses
and
told
us
what
pretty
notions
my
lord
pembroke
hath
of
the
first
chapter
of
genesis
and
a
great
deal
of
such
fooleries
which
the
king
made
mighty
mockery
at
i
hear
that
eight
of
the
ringleaders
in
the
late
tumults
of
the
prentices
at
easter
are
condemned
to
die
the
king
and
duke
of
york
themselves
in
my
absence
did
call
for
some
of
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
and
give
them
directions
about
the
business
of
the
certificates
which
i
despairing
to
do
any
thing
on
a
sunday
and
not
thinking
that
they
would
think
of
it
themselves
did
rest
satisfied
with
and
stayed
at
home
all
yesterday
leaving
it
to
do
something
in
this
day
but
i
find
that
the
king
and
duke
of
york
had
been
so
pressing
in
it
that
my
lord
ashly
was
more
forward
with
the
doing
of
it
this
day
than
i
could
have
been
and
so
i
to
white
hall
with
alderman
backewell
in
his
coach
with
blany
my
lord
secretary
and
there
did
draw
up
a
rough
draught
of
what
order
i
would
have
and
did
carry
it
in
and
had
it
read
twice
and
approved
of
before
my
lord
ashly
and
three
more
of
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
and
then
went
up
to
the
chamber
where
the
duke
of
york
and
prince
rupert
and
the
rest
of
the
committee
of
the
navy
were
sitting
and
i
did
get
some
of
them
to
read
it
there
and
they
would
have
had
it
passed
presently
but
sir
john
nichollas
desired
they
would
first
have
it
approved
by
a
full
council
and
therefore
a
council
extraordinary
was
readily
summoned
against
the
afternoon
and
the
duke
of
york
run
presently
to
the
king
as
if
now
they
were
really
set
to
mind
their
business
which
god
grant
montagu
did
tell
me
how
vaughan
in
that
very
room
did
say
that
i
was
a
great
man
and
had
great
understanding
and
i
know
not
what
which
i
confess
i
was
a
little
proud
of
if
i
may
believe
him
here
i
do
hear
as
a
great
secret
that
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
duchesse
and
my
lady
castlemaine
are
now
all
agreed
in
a
strict
league
and
all
things
like
to
go
very
current
and
that
it
is
not
impossible
to
have
my
lord
clarendon
in
time
here
again
but
i
do
hear
that
my
lady
castlemaine
is
horribly
vexed
at
the
late
libell
the
petition
of
the
poor
prostitutes
about
the
town
whose
houses
were
pulled
down
the
other
day
i
have
got
one
of
them
and
it
is
not
very
witty
but
devilish
severe
against
her
and
the
king
and
i
wonder
how
it
durst
be
printed
and
spread
abroad
which
shows
that
the
times
are
loose
and
come
to
a
great
disregard
of
the
king
or
court
or
govermment
to
the
park
and
then
to
the
house
and
there
at
the
door
eat
and
drank
whither
came
my
lady
kerneagy
carnegie
of
whom
creed
tells
me
more
particulars
how
her
lord
finding
her
and
the
duke
of
york
at
the
king
first
coming
in
too
kind
did
get
it
out
of
her
that
he
did
dishonour
him
and
did
take
the
most
pernicious
and
full
piece
of
revenge
that
ever
i
heard
of
and
he
at
this
day
owns
it
with
great
glory
and
looks
upon
the
duke
of
york
and
the
world
with
great
content
in
the
ampleness
of
his
revenge
vide
memoires
de
grammont
this
day
in
the
afternoon
stepping
with
the
duke
of
york
into
james
park
it
rained
and
i
was
forced
to
lend
the
duke
of
york
my
cloak
which
he
wore
through
the
park
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
english
monsieur
a
comedy
by
james
howard
sitting
for
privacy
sake
in
an
upper
box
the
play
hath
much
mirth
in
it
as
to
that
particular
humour
after
the
play
done
i
down
to
knipp
and
did
stay
her
undressing
herself
and
there
saw
the
several
players
men
and
women
go
by
and
pretty
to
see
how
strange
they
are
all
one
to
another
after
the
play
is
done
here
i
hear
sir
davenant
is
just
now
dead
and
so
who
will
succeed
him
in
the
mastership
of
the
house
is
not
yet
known
the
eldest
davenport
is
it
seems
gone
from
this
house
to
be
kept
by
somebody
which
i
am
glad
of
she
being
a
very
bad
actor
knipp
tells
me
that
my
lady
castlemaine
is
mightily
in
love
with
hart
of
their
house
and
he
is
much
with
her
in
private
and
she
goes
to
him
and
do
give
him
many
presents
and
that
the
thing
is
most
certain
and
beck
marshall
only
privy
to
it
and
the
means
of
bringing
them
together
which
is
a
very
odd
thing
and
by
this
means
she
is
even
with
the
king
love
to
davis
to
drumbleby
and
there
did
talk
a
great
deal
about
pipes
and
did
buy
a
recorder
which
i
do
intend
to
learn
to
play
on
the
sound
of
it
being
of
all
sounds
in
the
world
most
pleasing
to
me
i
up
and
down
to
the
duke
of
york
playhouse
there
to
see
which
i
did
sir
davenant
corpse
carried
out
towards
westminster
there
to
be
buried
here
were
many
coaches
and
six
horses
and
many
hacknies
that
made
it
look
methought
as
if
it
were
the
buriall
of
a
poor
poet
he
seemed
to
have
many
children
by
five
or
six
in
the
first
all
boys
to
my
office
where
is
come
a
packet
from
the
downes
from
my
brother
balty
who
with
harman
are
arrived
there
of
which
this
day
comes
the
first
news
and
now
the
parliament
will
be
satisfied
i
suppose
about
the
business
they
have
so
long
desired
between
brouncker
henry
brouncker
and
harman
about
not
prosecuting
the
first
victory
to
westminster
hall
where
i
hear
pen
is
ordered
to
be
impeached
there
spoke
with
many
and
particularly
with
montagu
and
went
with
him
and
creed
to
his
house
where
he
told
how
sir
pen
hath
been
severe
to
lord
sandwich
but
the
coventrys
both
labouring
to
save
him
by
laying
it
on
lord
sandwich
which
our
friends
cry
out
upon
and
i
am
silent
but
do
believe
they
did
it
as
the
only
way
to
save
him
it
could
not
be
carried
to
commit
him
it
is
thought
the
house
do
cool
sir
coventry
being
for
him
provoked
sir
howard
and
his
party
court
all
for
pen
i
hear
that
the
house
is
upon
the
business
of
harman
who
they
say
takes
all
on
himself
do
hear
this
morning
that
harman
is
committed
by
the
parliament
last
night
the
day
he
came
up
which
is
hard
but
he
took
all
upon
himself
first
and
then
when
a
witness
came
in
to
say
otherwise
he
would
have
retracted
and
the
house
took
it
so
ill
they
would
commit
him
roger
pepys
did
tell
me
the
whole
story
of
harman
how
he
prevaricated
and
hath
undoubtedly
been
imposed
on
and
wheedled
and
he
is
like
the
miller
man
that
in
richard
the
third
time
was
hanged
for
his
master
to
white
hall
and
there
hear
how
brouncker
is
tied
which
i
think
will
undo
him
but
what
good
it
will
do
harman
i
know
not
he
hath
so
befouled
himself
but
it
will
be
good
sport
to
my
lord
chancellor
to
hear
how
his
great
enemy
is
fain
to
take
the
same
course
that
he
is
there
met
robinson
who
tells
me
that
he
fears
his
master
sir
coventry
will
this
week
have
his
business
brought
upon
the
stage
again
about
selling
of
places
which
i
shall
be
sorry
for
though
the
less
since
i
hear
his
standing
up
for
pen
the
other
day
to
the
prejudice
though
not
to
the
ruin
of
my
lord
sandwich
and
yet
i
do
think
what
he
did
he
did
out
of
a
principle
of
honesty
meeting
sir
william
hooker
the
alderman
he
did
cry
out
mighty
high
against
sir
pen
for
his
getting
such
an
estate
and
giving
with
his
daughter
which
is
more
by
half
than
ever
he
did
give
but
this
the
world
believes
and
so
let
them
i
hear
how
sir
pen
impeachment
was
read
and
agreed
to
in
the
house
this
day
and
ordered
to
be
engrossed
and
he
suspended
the
house
harman
set
at
liberty
and
brouncker
put
out
of
the
house
and
a
writ
at
romney
which
brouncker
represented
for
a
new
election
and
an
impeachment
ordered
to
be
brought
in
against
him
he
being
fled
to
white
hall
and
there
we
attended
the
duke
of
york
as
usual
and
i
did
present
pett
the
widow
and
her
petition
to
the
duke
of
york
for
some
relief
from
the
king
here
was
a
proposition
made
to
the
duke
of
york
by
captain
von
hemskirke
for
to
discover
an
art
how
to
make
a
ship
go
two
feet
for
one
what
any
ship
do
now
which
the
king
inclines
to
try
it
costing
him
nothing
to
try
and
it
is
referred
to
us
to
contract
with
the
man
then
by
water
from
the
to
westminster
hall
and
taking
water
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
were
in
the
new
buildings
and
the
duke
of
york
called
to
me
whither
i
was
going
and
i
answered
aloud
to
wait
on
our
masters
at
westminster
at
which
he
and
all
the
company
laughed
but
i
was
sorry
and
troubled
for
it
afterwards
for
fear
any
should
have
been
there
and
it
will
be
a
caution
to
me
for
the
time
to
come
i
did
hear
the
duke
of
york
tell
how
sir
impeachment
was
brought
into
the
house
of
lords
and
he
spoke
with
great
kindness
of
him
and
that
the
lords
would
not
commit
him
till
they
could
find
precedent
for
it
and
did
incline
to
favour
him
to
westminster
hall
and
there
met
with
roger
pepys
and
he
tells
me
that
nothing
hath
lately
passed
about
my
lord
sandwich
but
only
sir
robert
carr
did
speak
hardly
of
him
but
it
is
hoped
that
nothing
will
be
done
more
this
meeting
of
parliament
which
the
king
did
by
a
message
yesterday
declare
again
should
rise
the
of
may
and
then
only
adjourne
for
three
months
and
this
message
being
only
about
an
adjournment
did
please
them
mightily
for
they
are
desirous
of
their
power
mightily
to
westminster
hall
and
up
to
the
lords
house
and
there
saw
sir
pen
go
into
the
house
of
lords
where
his
impeachment
was
read
to
him
and
he
used
mighty
civilly
the
duke
of
york
being
there
and
two
days
hence
at
his
desire
he
is
to
bring
in
his
answer
and
a
day
then
to
be
appointed
for
his
being
heard
with
counsel
thence
down
into
the
hall
and
with
creed
and
godolphin
walked
and
do
hear
that
is
appointed
upon
a
motion
on
friday
last
to
discourse
the
business
of
my
lord
sandwich
moved
by
sir
howard
that
he
should
be
sent
for
home
and
i
fear
it
will
be
ordered
certain
news
come
i
hear
this
day
that
the
spanish
plenipotentiary
in
flanders
will
not
agree
to
the
peace
and
terms
we
and
the
dutch
have
made
for
him
and
the
king
of
france
and
by
this
means
the
face
of
things
may
be
altered
and
we
forced
to
join
with
the
french
against
spain
which
will
be
an
odd
thing
by
coach
to
westminster
hall
and
there
do
understand
that
the
business
of
religion
and
the
act
against
conventicles
have
so
taken
them
up
all
this
morning
and
do
still
that
my
lord
sandwich
business
is
not
like
to
come
on
which
i
am
heartily
glad
of
this
law
against
conventicles
is
very
severe
but
creed
whom
i
meet
here
do
tell
me
that
it
being
moved
that
papists
meetings
might
be
included
the
house
was
divided
upon
it
and
it
was
carried
in
the
negative
which
will
give
great
disgust
to
the
people
i
doubt
to
the
king
house
and
there
did
see
love
in
a
maze
wherein
very
good
mirth
of
lacy
the
clown
and
wintershell
the
his
master
to
white
hall
and
there
do
hear
how
sir
pen
hath
delivered
in
his
answer
and
the
lords
have
sent
it
down
to
the
commons
but
they
have
not
yet
read
it
nor
taken
notice
of
it
so
as
i
believe
they
will
by
design
defer
it
till
they
rise
that
so
he
by
lying
under
an
impeachment
may
be
prevented
in
his
going
to
sea
which
will
vex
him
and
trouble
the
duke
of
york
to
westminster
hall
and
there
met
montagu
and
walked
and
talked
who
tells
me
that
the
best
fence
against
the
present
fury
is
delay
and
recommended
it
to
me
in
my
business
and
my
own
if
i
have
any
and
is
that
that
sir
coventry
do
take
and
will
secure
himself
that
the
king
will
deliver
up
all
to
the
parliament
and
being
petitioned
the
other
day
by
brouncker
to
protect
him
with
teares
in
his
eyes
the
king
did
say
he
could
not
and
bid
him
shift
for
himself
at
least
till
the
house
is
up
to
the
dolphin
tavern
there
to
meet
on
neighbours
all
of
the
parish
this
being
to
dine
and
did
and
much
very
good
discourse
they
being
most
of
them
very
able
merchants
as
any
in
the
city
sir
andrew
rickard
vandeputt
sir
john
fredericke
harrington
and
others
they
talked
with
mills
about
the
meaning
of
this
day
and
the
good
uses
of
it
and
how
heretofore
and
yet
in
several
places
they
do
whip
a
boy
at
each
place
they
stop
at
in
their
procession
stopped
to
talk
with
brisband
who
gives
me
an
account
of
the
rough
usage
sir
carteret
and
his
counsel
had
the
other
day
before
the
commissioners
of
accounts
and
what
i
do
believe
we
shall
all
of
us
have
in
a
greater
degree
than
any
he
hath
had
yet
with
them
before
their
three
years
are
out
which
are
not
yet
begun
nor
god
knows
when
they
will
this
being
like
to
be
no
session
of
parliament
when
they
now
rise
thus
ends
this
month
my
wife
in
the
country
myself
full
of
pleasure
and
expence
in
some
trouble
for
my
friends
and
my
lord
sandwich
by
the
parliament
and
more
for
my
eyes
which
are
daily
worse
and
worse
that
i
dare
not
write
or
read
almost
any
thing
the
parliament
going
in
a
few
days
to
rise
myself
so
long
without
accounting
now
for
seven
or
eight
months
i
think
or
more
that
i
know
not
what
condition
almost
i
am
in
as
to
getting
or
spending
for
all
that
time
which
troubles
me
but
i
will
soon
do
it
the
kingdom
in
an
ill
state
through
poverty
a
fleet
going
out
and
no
money
to
maintain
it
or
set
it
out
seamen
yet
unpaid
and
mutinous
when
pressed
to
go
out
again
our
office
able
to
do
little
nobody
trusting
us
nor
we
desiring
any
to
trust
us
and
yet
have
not
money
for
any
thing
but
only
what
particularly
belongs
to
this
fleet
going
out
and
that
but
lamely
too
the
parliament
several
months
upon
an
act
for
but
can
not
or
will
not
agree
upon
it
but
do
keep
it
back
in
spite
of
the
king
desires
to
hasten
it
till
they
can
obtain
what
they
have
a
mind
in
revenge
upon
some
men
for
the
late
ill
managements
and
he
is
forced
to
submit
to
what
they
please
knowing
that
without
it
he
shall
have
no
money
and
they
as
well
that
if
they
give
the
money
the
king
will
suffer
them
to
do
little
more
and
then
the
business
of
religion
do
disquiet
every
body
the
parliament
being
vehement
against
the
nonconformists
while
the
king
seems
to
be
willing
to
countenance
them
so
we
are
all
poor
and
in
pieces
god
help
us
while
the
peace
is
like
to
go
on
between
spain
and
france
and
then
the
french
may
be
apprehended
able
to
attack
us
so
god
help
us
may
met
my
cosen
thomas
pepys
of
deptford
and
took
some
turns
with
him
and
he
is
mightily
troubled
for
this
act
now
passed
against
conventicles
and
in
few
words
and
sober
do
lament
the
condition
we
are
in
by
a
negligent
prince
and
a
mad
parliament
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
surprizall
and
a
disorder
in
the
pit
by
its
raining
in
from
the
cupola
at
top
i
understand
how
the
houses
of
commons
and
lords
are
like
to
disagree
very
much
about
the
business
of
the
east
india
company
and
one
skinner
to
the
latter
of
which
the
lords
have
awarded
from
the
former
for
some
wrong
done
him
heretofore
and
the
former
appealing
to
the
commons
the
lords
vote
their
petition
a
libell
and
so
there
is
like
to
follow
very
hot
work
to
church
where
i
saw
sir
rickard
though
he
be
under
the
black
rod
by
order
of
the
lords
house
upon
the
quarrel
between
the
east
india
company
and
skinner
which
is
like
to
come
to
a
very
great
heat
between
the
two
houses
to
to
see
sir
thomas
teddiman
who
is
very
ill
in
bed
of
a
fever
got
i
believe
by
the
fright
the
parliament
have
put
him
into
of
late
creed
and
i
to
the
duke
of
york
playhouse
and
there
coming
late
up
to
the
where
we
find
my
lady
castlemaine
and
several
great
ladies
and
there
we
sat
with
them
and
i
saw
the
impertinents
once
more
now
three
times
and
the
three
only
days
it
hath
been
acted
and
to
see
the
folly
how
the
house
do
this
day
cry
up
the
play
more
than
yesterday
and
i
for
that
reason
like
it
i
find
the
better
too
by
sir
positive
all
i
understand
is
meant
sir
robert
howard
my
lady
pretty
well
pleased
with
it
but
here
i
eat
close
to
her
fine
woman
willson
who
indeed
is
very
handsome
but
they
say
with
child
by
the
king
i
asked
and
she
told
me
this
was
the
first
time
her
lady
had
seen
it
i
having
a
mind
to
say
something
to
her
one
thing
of
familiarity
i
observed
in
my
lady
castlemaine
she
called
to
one
of
her
women
another
that
sat
by
this
for
a
little
patch
off
of
her
face
and
put
it
into
her
mouth
and
wetted
it
and
so
clapped
it
upon
her
own
by
the
side
of
her
mouth
i
suppose
she
feeling
a
pimple
rising
there
thence
with
creed
to
westminster
hall
and
there
met
with
cosen
roger
who
tells
me
of
the
great
conference
this
day
between
the
lords
and
commons
about
the
business
of
the
east
india
company
as
being
one
of
the
weightiest
conferences
that
hath
been
and
maintained
as
weightily
i
am
heartily
sorry
i
was
not
there
it
being
upon
a
mighty
point
of
the
privileges
of
the
subjects
of
england
in
regard
to
the
authority
of
the
house
of
lords
and
their
being
condemned
by
them
as
the
supreme
court
which
we
say
ought
not
to
be
but
by
appeal
from
other
courts
and
he
tells
me
that
the
commons
had
much
the
better
of
them
in
reason
and
history
there
quoted
and
believes
the
lords
will
let
it
fall
i
understand
that
my
lord
john
is
meant
by
woodrocke
in
the
impertinents
home
to
put
up
things
against
carrier
for
my
wife
and
among
others
a
very
fine
salmon
pie
sent
me
by
steventon
hewer
uncle
to
the
king
house
where
going
in
for
knipp
the
play
being
done
i
did
see
beck
marshall
come
dressed
off
the
stage
and
look
mighty
fine
and
pretty
and
noble
and
also
nell
in
her
boy
clothes
mighty
pretty
put
lord
their
confidence
and
how
many
men
do
hover
about
them
as
soon
as
they
come
off
the
stage
and
how
confident
they
are
in
their
talk
here
was
also
haynes
the
incomparable
dancer
of
the
king
house
then
we
abroad
to
marrowbone
and
there
walked
in
the
garden
the
first
time
i
ever
was
there
and
a
pretty
place
it
is
the
lords
house
did
sit
till
eleven
last
night
about
the
business
of
difference
between
them
and
the
commons
in
the
matter
of
the
east
india
company
to
my
lord
crewe
and
there
dined
where
case
the
minister
a
dull
fellow
in
his
talk
and
all
in
the
presbyterian
manner
a
great
deal
of
noise
and
a
kind
of
religious
tone
but
very
dull
after
dinner
my
lord
and
i
together
he
tells
me
he
hears
that
there
are
great
disputes
like
to
be
at
court
between
the
factions
of
the
two
women
my
lady
castlemaine
and
stewart
who
is
now
well
again
the
king
having
made
several
public
visits
to
her
and
like
to
come
to
court
the
other
is
to
go
to
which
is
taken
for
her
and
they
say
a
is
passed
for
for
it
he
believes
all
will
come
to
ruin
thence
i
to
white
hall
where
the
duke
of
york
gone
to
the
lords
house
where
there
is
to
be
a
conference
on
thee
lords
side
with
the
commons
this
afternoon
giving
in
their
reasons
which
i
would
have
been
at
but
could
not
for
going
by
direction
to
the
prince
chamber
there
brouncker
pen
and
wren
and
i
met
and
did
our
business
with
the
duke
of
york
but
lord
to
see
how
this
play
of
sir
positive
in
abuse
of
sir
robert
howard
do
take
all
the
duke
and
every
body
talk
being
of
that
and
telling
more
stories
of
him
of
the
like
nature
that
it
is
now
the
town
and
country
talk
and
they
say
is
most
exactly
true
the
duke
of
york
himself
said
that
of
his
playing
at
ball
is
true
and
told
several
other
stories
of
him
then
to
brouncker
house
and
there
sat
and
talked
i
asking
many
questions
in
mathematics
to
my
lord
which
he
do
me
the
pleasure
to
satisfy
me
in
i
hear
that
the
queene
hath
miscarryed
of
a
perfect
child
being
gone
about
ten
weeks
which
do
show
that
she
can
conceive
though
it
be
unfortunate
that
she
can
not
bring
forth
we
are
told
also
that
last
night
the
duchesse
of
monmouth
dancing
at
her
lodgings
hath
sprained
her
thigh
we
are
told
also
that
the
house
of
commons
sat
till
five
this
morning
upon
the
business
of
the
difference
between
the
lords
and
them
resolving
to
do
something
therein
before
they
rise
to
assert
their
privileges
so
i
at
noon
by
water
to
westminster
and
there
find
the
king
hath
waited
in
the
prince
chamber
these
two
hours
and
the
houses
are
not
ready
for
him
the
commons
having
sent
this
morning
after
their
long
debate
therein
the
last
night
to
the
lords
that
they
do
think
the
only
expedient
left
to
preserve
unity
between
the
two
houses
is
that
they
do
put
a
stop
to
any
proceedings
upon
their
late
judgement
against
the
east
india
company
till
their
next
meeting
to
which
the
lords
returned
answer
that
they
would
return
answer
to
them
by
a
messenger
of
their
own
which
they
not
presently
doing
they
were
all
inflamed
and
thought
it
was
only
a
trick
to
keep
them
in
suspense
till
the
king
come
to
adjourne
them
and
so
rather
than
lose
the
opportunity
of
doing
themselves
right
they
presently
with
great
fury
come
to
this
vote
that
whoever
should
assist
in
the
execution
of
the
judgement
of
the
lords
against
the
company
should
be
held
betrayers
of
the
liberties
of
the
people
of
england
and
of
the
privileges
of
that
house
this
the
lords
had
notice
of
and
were
mad
at
it
and
so
continued
debating
without
any
design
to
yield
to
the
commons
till
the
king
came
in
and
sent
for
the
commons
where
the
speaker
made
a
short
but
silly
speech
about
their
giving
him
and
then
the
several
bills
their
titles
were
read
and
the
king
assent
signified
in
the
proper
terms
according
to
the
nature
of
the
bills
of
which
about
three
or
four
were
public
bills
and
seven
or
eight
private
ones
the
additional
bills
for
the
building
of
the
city
and
the
bill
against
conventicles
being
none
of
them
the
king
did
make
a
short
silly
speech
which
he
read
giving
them
thanks
for
the
money
which
now
he
said
he
did
believe
would
be
sufficient
because
there
was
peace
between
his
neighbours
which
was
a
kind
of
a
slur
methought
to
the
commons
and
that
he
was
sorry
for
what
he
heard
of
difference
between
the
two
houses
but
that
he
hoped
their
recesse
would
put
them
into
a
way
of
accommodation
and
so
adjourned
them
to
the
of
august
and
then
recollected
himself
and
told
them
the
so
imperfect
a
speaker
he
is
so
the
commons
went
to
their
house
and
forthwith
adjourned
and
the
lords
resumed
their
house
the
king
being
gone
and
sat
an
hour
or
two
after
but
what
they
did
i
can
not
tell
but
every
body
expected
they
would
commit
sir
andrew
rickard
sir
samuel
barnardiston
wood
mentions
sir
barnadiston
as
a
leading
fanatic
circ
boone
and
wynne
who
were
all
there
and
called
in
upon
their
knees
to
the
bar
of
the
house
and
sir
john
robinson
i
left
there
endeavouring
to
prevent
their
being
committed
to
the
tower
lest
he
should
thereby
be
forced
to
deny
their
order
because
of
this
vote
of
the
commons
whereof
he
is
one
which
is
an
odde
case
lord
anglesy
in
talk
about
the
late
difference
between
the
two
houses
do
tell
us
that
he
thinks
the
house
of
lords
may
be
in
an
error
at
least
it
is
possible
they
may
in
this
matter
of
skinner
and
did
declare
his
judgement
in
the
house
of
lords
against
their
proceedings
therein
he
having
hindered
originall
causes
being
brought
into
their
house
notwithstanding
that
he
was
put
upon
defending
their
proceedings
but
that
he
is
confident
that
the
house
of
commons
are
in
the
wrong
in
the
method
they
take
to
remedy
an
error
of
the
lords
for
no
vote
of
theirs
can
do
it
but
in
all
like
cases
the
commons
have
done
it
by
petition
to
the
king
sent
up
to
the
lords
and
by
them
agreed
to
and
so
redressed
as
they
did
in
the
petition
of
right
he
says
that
he
did
tell
them
indeed
which
is
talked
of
and
which
did
vex
the
commons
that
the
lords
were
judices
nati
et
conciliarii
nati
but
all
other
judges
among
us
are
under
salary
and
the
commons
themselves
served
for
wages
and
therefore
the
lords
in
reason
the
freer
judges
to
attend
the
council
about
the
business
of
project
of
building
a
ship
that
sails
two
feet
for
one
of
any
other
ship
which
the
council
did
agree
to
be
put
in
practice
the
king
to
give
him
if
it
proves
good
in
hand
and
more
in
seven
years
which
for
my
part
i
think
a
piece
of
folly
for
them
to
meddle
with
because
the
secret
can
not
be
long
kept
this
morning
i
hear
that
last
night
sir
thomas
teddiman
poor
man
did
die
by
a
thrush
in
his
mouth
a
good
man
and
stout
and
able
and
much
lamented
though
people
do
make
a
little
mirth
and
say
as
i
believe
it
did
in
good
part
that
the
business
of
the
parliament
did
break
his
heart
or
at
least
put
him
into
this
fever
and
disorder
that
caused
his
death
to
a
committee
for
tangier
where
god
knows
how
my
lord
bellasses
accounts
passed
understood
by
nobody
but
my
lord
ashly
who
i
believe
was
allowed
to
let
them
go
as
he
pleased
but
here
sir
cholmly
had
his
propositions
read
about
a
greater
price
for
his
work
of
the
molle
or
to
do
it
upon
account
which
being
read
he
was
bid
to
withdraw
but
lord
to
see
how
unlucky
a
man
may
be
by
chance
for
making
an
unfortunate
motion
when
they
were
almost
tired
with
the
other
business
the
duke
of
york
did
find
fault
with
it
and
that
made
all
the
rest
that
i
believe
he
had
better
have
given
a
great
deal
and
had
nothing
said
to
it
whereas
i
have
seen
other
things
more
extravagant
passed
at
first
hearing
without
any
difficulty
to
by
mooregate
a
hall
i
never
heard
of
before
to
sir
thomas
teddiman
burial
where
most
people
belonging
to
the
sea
were
and
here
we
had
rings
and
here
i
do
hear
that
some
of
the
last
words
that
he
said
were
that
he
had
a
very
good
king
god
bless
him
but
that
the
parliament
had
very
ill
rewarded
him
for
all
the
service
he
had
endeavoured
to
do
them
and
his
country
so
that
for
certain
this
did
go
far
towards
his
death
but
lord
to
see
among
the
company
the
young
commanders
and
thomas
killigrew
and
others
that
came
how
unlike
a
burial
this
was
taking
out
some
ballads
out
of
his
pocket
which
i
read
and
the
rest
come
about
me
to
hear
and
there
very
merry
we
were
all
they
being
new
ballads
by
and
by
the
corpse
went
and
i
with
my
lord
brouncker
and
clerke
and
pierce
as
far
as
the
foot
of
and
there
we
struck
off
into
the
rest
going
to
redriffe
where
he
is
to
be
buried
the
duchesse
of
monmouth
hip
is
i
hear
now
set
again
after
much
pain
i
am
told
also
that
the
countesse
of
shrewsbery
is
brought
home
by
the
duke
of
buckingham
to
his
house
where
his
duchesse
saying
that
it
was
not
for
her
and
the
other
to
live
together
in
a
house
he
answered
why
madam
i
did
think
so
and
therefore
have
ordered
your
coach
to
be
ready
to
carry
you
to
your
father
which
was
a
devilish
speech
but
they
say
true
and
my
lady
shrewsbery
is
there
it
seems
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
best
part
of
the
sea
voyage
a
comedy
by
beaumont
and
fletcher
where
knipp
did
her
part
of
sorrow
very
well
lord
day
up
and
put
on
my
new
with
a
according
to
the
new
fashion
and
the
hands
of
my
vest
and
tunique
laced
with
of
the
colour
of
my
suit
and
so
very
handsome
to
church
to
my
lord
bellasses
at
his
new
house
by
my
late
lord
treasurer
which
indeed
is
mighty
noble
and
good
pictures
indeed
not
one
bad
one
in
it
it
being
almost
twelve
or
little
more
to
the
king
playhouse
where
the
doors
were
not
then
open
but
presently
they
did
open
and
we
in
and
find
many
people
already
come
in
by
private
ways
into
the
pit
it
being
the
first
day
of
sir
charles
sedley
new
play
so
long
expected
the
mulbery
garden
of
whom
being
so
reputed
a
wit
all
the
world
do
expect
great
matters
i
having
sat
here
awhile
and
eat
nothing
did
slip
out
getting
a
boy
to
keep
my
place
and
to
the
rose
tavern
and
there
got
half
a
breast
of
mutton
off
of
the
spit
and
dined
all
alone
and
so
to
the
play
again
where
the
king
and
queene
by
and
by
come
and
all
the
court
and
the
house
infinitely
full
but
the
play
when
it
come
though
there
was
here
and
there
a
pretty
saying
and
that
not
very
many
neither
yet
the
whole
of
the
play
had
nothing
extraordinary
in
it
all
neither
of
language
nor
design
insomuch
that
the
king
i
did
not
see
laugh
nor
pleased
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
nor
the
company
insomuch
that
i
have
not
been
less
pleased
at
a
new
play
in
my
life
i
think
pierce
tells
me
that
for
certain
vaughan
is
made
lord
chief
justice
which
i
am
glad
of
he
tells
me
too
that
since
my
lord
of
ormond
coming
over
the
king
begins
to
be
mightily
reclaimed
and
sups
every
night
with
great
pleasure
with
the
queene
and
yet
it
seems
he
is
mighty
hot
upon
the
duchesse
of
richmond
insomuch
that
upon
sunday
was
at
night
after
he
had
ordered
his
guards
and
coach
to
be
ready
to
carry
him
to
the
park
he
did
on
a
sudden
take
a
pair
of
oars
or
sculler
and
all
alone
or
but
one
with
him
go
to
somerset
house
and
there
the
not
being
open
himself
clamber
over
the
wall
to
make
a
visit
to
her
which
is
a
horrid
shame
to
the
where
the
committee
of
the
navy
sat
and
here
we
discoursed
several
things
but
lord
like
fools
so
as
it
was
a
shame
to
see
things
of
this
importance
managed
by
a
council
that
understand
nothing
of
them
and
among
other
things
one
was
about
this
building
of
a
ship
with
hemskirke
secret
to
sail
a
third
faster
than
any
other
ship
but
he
hath
got
prince
rupert
on
his
side
and
by
that
means
i
believe
will
get
his
conditions
made
better
than
he
would
otherwise
or
ought
indeed
to
the
on
the
site
of
which
was
erected
where
i
never
was
before
and
find
it
a
very
silly
place
worse
than
and
but
little
company
only
a
wilderness
here
that
is
somewhat
pretty
to
the
office
where
meets
me
sir
richard
ford
who
among
other
things
congratulates
me
as
one
or
two
did
yesterday
on
my
great
purchase
and
he
advises
me
rather
to
forbear
if
it
be
not
done
as
a
thing
that
the
world
will
envy
me
in
and
what
is
it
but
my
cosen
tom
pepys
buying
of
martin
abbey
in
the
site
of
murton
alias
martin
priory
was
conveyed
by
ellis
crispe
to
thomas
pepys
of
hatcham
barns
master
of
the
office
to
charles
ii
and
james
manning
surrey
in
surry
all
the
town
is
full
of
the
talk
of
a
meteor
or
some
fire
that
did
on
saturday
last
fly
over
the
city
at
night
which
do
put
me
in
mind
that
being
then
walking
in
the
dark
an
hour
or
more
myself
in
the
garden
after
i
had
done
writing
i
did
see
a
light
before
me
come
from
behind
me
which
made
me
turn
back
my
head
and
i
did
see
a
sudden
fire
or
light
running
in
the
sky
as
it
were
towards
and
vanished
very
quick
which
did
make
me
bethink
myself
what
holyday
it
was
and
took
it
for
some
rocket
though
it
was
much
brighter
and
the
world
do
make
much
discourse
of
it
their
apprehensione
being
mighty
full
of
the
rest
of
the
city
to
be
burned
and
the
papists
to
cut
our
throats
i
fitted
myself
for
my
journey
to
brampton
which
i
fear
will
not
be
pleasant
because
of
the
wet
weather
it
rained
very
hard
all
this
day
but
the
less
it
troubles
me
because
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
court
are
at
this
day
at
newmarket
at
a
great
and
proposed
great
pleasure
for
two
or
three
days
but
are
in
the
same
wet
to
the
bull
in
and
there
about
six
took
coach
and
so
away
to
bishop
stafford
bishop
stortford
in
herts
the
ways
are
mighty
full
of
water
so
as
hardly
to
be
passed
after
dinner
to
cambridge
about
nine
at
night
and
there
i
met
my
father
horses
we
set
out
by
three
to
brampton
here
i
saw
my
brother
and
sister
jackson
after
dinner
my
lady
sandwich
sending
to
see
whether
i
was
come
i
presently
took
horse
and
find
her
and
her
family
at
chapel
and
thither
i
went
in
to
them
and
sat
out
the
sermon
where
i
heard
jervas
fulwood
now
their
chaplain
preach
a
very
good
and
civantick
kind
of
sermon
too
good
for
an
ordinary
congregation
after
sermon
i
with
my
lady
and
my
lady
hinchingbroke
and
paulina
and
lord
hinchingbroke
to
cambridge
the
waters
not
being
now
so
high
as
before
here
lighting
i
took
my
boy
and
two
brothers
and
walked
to
magdalene
college
and
there
into
the
butterys
as
a
stranger
and
there
drank
of
their
beer
which
pleased
me
as
the
best
i
ever
drank
and
hear
by
the
butler
man
who
was
son
to
goody
mulliner
the
college
that
we
used
to
buy
stewed
prunes
of
concerning
the
college
and
persons
in
it
and
find
very
few
only
hollins
john
hollins
of
medley
in
yorkshire
admitted
a
pensioner
of
magdalene
college
march
and
pechell
i
think
that
were
of
my
time
to
the
coach
where
about
six
we
set
out
and
got
to
before
eight
the
waters
being
now
most
of
them
down
and
we
avoiding
the
bad
way
in
the
forest
by
a
privy
way
which
brought
us
to
hodsden
and
so
to
tibald
that
road
which
was
mighty
pleasant
met
sawyer
my
old
and
he
and
i
by
water
together
to
the
temple
he
giving
me
an
account
of
the
base
rude
usage
which
he
and
sir
carteret
had
lately
before
the
commissioners
of
accounts
where
he
was
as
counsel
to
sir
carteret
which
i
was
sorry
to
hear
they
behaving
themselves
like
most
insolent
and
men
to
see
sir
pen
whom
i
find
still
very
ill
of
the
gout
sitting
in
his
great
chair
made
on
purpose
for
persons
sick
of
that
disease
for
their
ease
and
this
very
chair
he
tells
me
was
made
for
my
lady
lambert
received
some
directions
from
the
duke
of
york
and
the
committee
of
the
navy
about
casting
up
the
charge
of
the
present
summer
fleet
that
so
they
may
come
within
the
bounds
of
the
sum
given
by
the
parliament
but
it
is
pretty
to
see
how
prince
rupert
and
other
mad
silly
people
are
for
setting
out
but
a
little
fleet
there
being
no
occasion
for
it
and
say
it
will
be
best
to
save
the
money
for
better
uses
but
sir
carteret
did
declare
that
in
wisdom
it
was
better
to
do
so
but
that
in
obedience
to
the
parliament
he
was
for
setting
out
the
fifty
sail
talked
on
though
it
spent
all
the
money
and
to
little
purpose
and
that
this
was
better
than
to
leave
it
to
the
parliament
to
make
bad
constructions
of
their
thrift
if
any
trouble
should
happen
thus
wary
the
world
is
grown
thence
back
again
presently
home
and
did
business
till
noon
and
then
to
sir
carteret
to
dinner
with
much
good
company
it
being
the
king
birthday
and
many
healths
drunk
and
here
i
did
receive
another
letter
from
my
lord
sandwich
which
troubles
me
to
see
how
i
have
neglected
him
in
not
writing
or
but
once
all
this
time
of
his
being
abroad
and
i
see
he
takes
notice
but
yet
gently
of
it
up
and
put
on
a
new
summer
black
bombazin
suit
and
being
come
now
to
an
agreement
with
my
barber
to
keep
my
perriwig
in
good
order
at
i
am
like
to
go
very
spruce
more
than
i
used
to
do
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
philaster
a
tragedy
by
beaumont
and
fletcher
where
it
is
pretty
to
see
how
i
could
remember
almost
all
along
ever
since
i
was
a
boy
arethusa
the
part
which
i
was
to
have
acted
at
sir
robert
cooke
and
it
was
very
pleasant
to
me
but
more
to
think
what
a
ridiculous
thing
it
would
have
been
for
me
to
have
acted
a
beautiful
woman
to
fox
hall
and
there
fell
into
the
company
of
harry
killigrew
a
rogue
newly
come
out
of
france
but
still
in
disgrace
at
our
court
and
young
newport
and
others
as
very
rogues
as
any
in
the
town
who
were
ready
to
take
hold
of
every
woman
that
come
by
them
and
so
to
supper
in
an
arbour
but
lord
their
mad
talk
did
make
my
heart
ake
and
here
i
first
understood
by
their
talk
the
meaning
of
the
company
that
lately
were
called
ballers
harris
telling
how
it
was
by
a
meeting
of
some
young
blades
where
he
was
among
them
and
my
lady
bennet
and
her
ladies
and
there
dancing
naked
and
all
the
roguish
things
in
the
world
but
lord
what
loose
company
was
this
that
i
was
in
though
full
of
wit
and
worth
a
being
in
for
once
to
know
the
nature
of
it
and
their
manner
of
talk
and
lives
i
hear
that
davis
is
quite
gone
from
the
duke
of
york
house
and
gosnell
comes
in
her
room
which
i
am
glad
of
at
the
play
at
court
the
other
night
davis
was
there
and
when
she
was
to
come
to
dance
her
jigg
the
queene
would
not
stay
to
see
it
which
people
do
think
was
out
of
displeasure
at
her
being
the
king
mistress
that
she
could
not
bear
it
my
lady
castlemaine
is
it
seems
now
mightily
out
of
request
the
king
coming
little
to
her
and
then
she
mighty
melancholy
and
discontented
june
alone
to
fox
hall
and
walked
and
saw
young
newport
and
two
more
rogues
of
the
town
seize
on
two
ladies
who
walked
with
them
an
hour
with
their
masks
on
perhaps
civil
ladies
and
there
i
left
them
to
white
hall
to
the
where
i
did
present
the
duke
of
york
with
an
account
of
the
charge
of
the
present
fleet
to
his
satisfaction
and
this
being
done
did
ask
his
leave
for
my
going
out
of
town
five
or
six
days
which
he
did
give
me
saying
that
my
diligence
in
the
king
business
was
such
that
i
ought
not
to
be
denied
when
my
own
business
called
me
any
whither
to
my
lord
crewe
to
visit
him
from
whom
i
learn
nothing
but
that
there
hath
been
some
controversy
at
the
table
about
my
lord
sandwich
signing
where
some
would
not
have
had
him
in
the
treaty
with
portugall
but
all
i
think
is
over
in
it
clerke
the
solicitor
dined
with
me
and
my
clerks
after
dinner
i
carried
and
set
him
down
at
the
temple
he
observing
to
me
how
sepulchre
church
steeple
is
repaired
already
a
good
deal
and
the
is
contracted
for
by
the
city
to
begin
to
be
built
this
summer
which
do
please
me
mightily
i
to
white
hall
and
walked
through
the
park
for
a
little
ayre
and
so
back
to
the
to
the
committee
of
the
navy
about
the
business
of
fitting
the
present
fleet
suitable
to
the
money
given
which
as
the
king
orders
it
and
by
what
appears
will
be
very
little
and
so
as
i
perceive
the
duke
of
york
will
have
nothing
to
command
nor
can
intend
to
go
abroad
but
it
is
pretty
to
see
how
careful
these
great
men
are
to
do
every
thing
so
as
they
may
answer
it
to
the
parliament
thinking
themselves
safe
in
nothing
but
where
the
judges
with
whom
they
often
advise
do
say
the
matter
is
doubtful
and
so
they
take
upon
themselves
then
to
be
the
chief
persons
to
interpret
what
is
doubtful
thence
home
and
all
the
evening
to
set
matters
in
order
against
my
going
to
brampton
being
resolved
upon
my
journey
and
having
the
duke
of
leave
again
though
i
do
plainly
see
that
i
can
very
ill
be
spared
now
there
being
much
business
especially
about
this
which
i
have
attended
the
council
about

large
and
fine
and

the
history

worth
per
annum
and
that
foly

here
lately
to
see
how
their
lands
were
settled
and
here
in
old

the
story

occasion
of

a
rebus
at
the
bottom

poor
which
they
would
not

in
their
box
so
to

what

so
forth
towards
hungerford
led
this
good
way
by
our
landlord
one
heart
an
old
but
very
civil
and
man
more
than
i
ever
heard
of
his
quality
he
gone
we
forward
and
i
vexed
at
my
people
not
minding
the
way
so
come
to
hungerford
where
very
good
trouts
eels
and
fish
dinner
a
mean
town
at
dinner
there
thence
set
out
with
a
guide
who
saw
us
to
and
then
left
us
so
all
over
the
plain
by
the
sight
of
the
steeple
the
plain
high
and
low
to
salisbury
by
night
but
before
i
came
to
the
town
i
saw
a
great
fortification
and
there
light
and
to
it
and
in
it
and
find
it
prodigious
so
as
to
fright
me
to
be
in
it
all
alone
at
that
time
of
night
it
being
dark
i
understand
since
it
to
be
that
that
is
called
old
sarum
come
to
the
george
inne
where
lay
in
a
silk
bed
and
very
good
diet
to
supper
then
to
bed
thursday
up
and
hewer
and
i
up
and
down
the
town
and
find
it
a
very
brave
place
the
river
goes
through
every
street
and
a
most
capacious
the
city
great
i
think
greater
than
hereford
but
the
minster
most
admirable
as
big
i
think
and
handsomer
than
westminster
and
a
most
large
close
about
it
and
horses
for
the
officers
thereof
and
a
fine
palace
for
the
bishop
so
to
my
lodging
back
and
took
out
my
wife
and
people
to
show
them
the
town
and
church
but
they
being
at
prayers
we
could
not
be
shown
the
quire
a
very
good
organ
and
i
looked
in
and
saw
the
bishop
my
friend
ward
thence
to
the
inns
and
there
not
being
able
to
hire
and
not
willing
to
use
our
own
we
got
very
dear
boy
that
went
to
look
for
them
so
the
three
women
behind
hewer
murford
and
our
guide
and
i
single
to
stonehenge
over
the
plain
and
some
great
hills
even
to
fright
us
come
thither
and
find
them
as
prodigious
as
any
tales
i
ever
heard
of
them
and
worth
going
this
journey
to
see
god
knows
what
their
use
was
they
are
hard
to
tell
but
yet
may
be
told
gave
the
for
leading
our
horses
so
back
by
wilton
my
lord
pembroke
house
which
we
could
not
see
he
being
just
coming
to
town
but
the
situation
i
do
not
like
nor
the
house
at
present
much
it
being
in
a
low
but
rich
valley
so
back
home
and
there
being
light
we
to
the
church
and
there
find
them
at
prayers
again
so
could
not
see
the
quire
but
i
sent
the
women
home
and
i
did
go
in
and
saw
very
many
fine
tombs
and
among
the
rest
some
very
ancient
of
the
montagus
so
home
to
dinner
and
that
being
done
paid
the
reckoning
which
was
so
exorbitant
and
particular
in
rate
of
my
horses
and
for
bread
and
beer
that
i
was
mad
and
resolve
to
trouble
the
mistress
about
it
and
get
something
for
the
poor
and
come
away
in
that
humour
servants
poor
guide
to
the
stones
poor
woman
in
the
street
ribbands
sempstress
for
hewer
lent
hewer
thence
about
six
and
with
a
guide
went
over
the
smooth
plain
indeed
till
night
and
then
by
a
happy
mistake
and
that
looked
like
an
adventure
we
were
carried
out
of
our
way
to
a
town
where
we
would
lie
since
we
could
not
go
as
far
as
we
would
by
and
by
to
bed
glad
of
this
mistake
because
it
seems
had
we
gone
on
as
me
pretended
we
could
not
have
passed
with
our
coach
and
must
have
lain
on
the
plain
all
night
this
day
from
salisbury
i
wrote
by
the
post
my
excuse
for
not
coming
home
which
i
hope
will
do
for
i
am
resolved
to
see
the
bath
and
it
may
be
bristol
friday
up
finding
our
beds
good
but
lousy
which
made
us
merry
we
set
out
the
reckoning
and
servants
coming
to
my
guide
thither
coachman
advanced
so
rode
a
very
good
way
led
to
my
great
content
by
our
landlord
to
with
great
pleasure
being
now
come
into
somersetshire
where
my
wife
and
deb
mightily
joyed
thereat
they
were
natives
of
that
county
i
commending
the
country
as
indeed
it
deserves
and
the
first
town
we
came
to
was
brekington
where
we
stopping
for
something
for
the
horses
we
called
two
or
three
little
boys
to
us
and
pleased
ourselves
with
their
manner
of
speech
at
i
walked
to
the
church
and
there
saw
a
very
ancient
tomb
of
some
knight
templar
i
think
and
here
saw
the
tombstone
whereon
there
were
only
two
heads
cut
which
the
story
goes
and
creditably
were
two
sisters
called
the
fair
maids
of
foscott
that
had
two
bodies
upward
and
one
belly
and
there
lie
buried
here
is
also
a
very
fine
ring
of
six
bells
and
they
mighty
tuneable
having
dined
very
well
me
come
before
night
to
the
bath
where
i
presently
stepped
out
with
my
landlord
and
saw
the
baths
with
people
in
them
they
are
not
so
large
as
i
expected
but
yet
pleasant
and
the
town
most
of
stone
and
clean
though
the
streets
generally
narrow
i
home
and
being
weary
went
to
bed
without
supper
the
rest
supping
saturday
up
at
four
being
by
appointment
called
up
to
the
cross
bath
where
we
were
carried
after
one
another
myself
and
wife
and
betty
turner
willet
and
hewer
and
by
and
by
though
we
designed
to
have
done
before
company
come
much
company
come
very
fine
ladies
and
the
manner
pretty
enough
only
methinks
it
can
not
be
clean
to
go
so
many
bodies
together
in
the
same
water
good
conversation
among
them
that
are
acquainted
here
and
stay
together
strange
to
see
how
hot
the
water
is
and
in
some
places
though
this
is
the
most
temperate
bath
the
springs
so
hot
as
the
feet
not
able
to
endure
but
strange
to
see
when
women
and
men
here
that
live
all
the
season
in
these
waters
can
not
but
be
parboiled
and
look
like
the
creatures
of
the
bath
carried
away
wrapped
in
a
sheet
and
in
a
chair
home
and
there
one
after
another
thus
carried
i
staying
above
two
hours
in
the
water
home
to
bed
sweating
for
an
hour
and
by
and
by
comes
musick
to
play
to
me
extraordinary
good
as
ever
i
heard
at
london
almost
any
where
up
to
go
to
bristoll
about
eleven
and
paying
my
landlord
that
was
our
guide
from
chiltren
and
the
serjeant
of
the
bath
and
the
man
that
carried
us
in
chairs
set
out
toward
bristoll
and
come
thither
the
way
bad
in
coach
hired
to
spare
our
own
horses
but
country
good
about
two
where
set
down
at
the
and
there
being
trimmed
by
a
very
handsome
fellow
walked
with
my
wife
and
people
through
the
city
which
is
in
every
respect
another
london
that
one
can
hardly
know
it
to
stand
in
the
country
no
more
than
that
no
carts
it
standing
generally
on
vaults
only
so
to
the
three
crowns
tavern
i
was
directed
but
when
i
came
in
the
master
told
me
that
he
had
newly
given
over
the
selling

to
the
ship

he
showed
me

and
made
me
understand
many
things
of
the
place
and
led
us
through
where
our
girl
was
born
but
lord
the
joy
that
was
among
the
old
poor
people
of

seems
her
mother
being
a
brave
woman
and
mightily
beloved

so
brought
us
a
back
way
by
surprize
to
his
house

whole
cold

plenty
of
brave
wine
and
above
all
bristol
milk
where
comes
in
another
poor
woman
who
hearing
that
deb
was
here
did
come
running
hither
and
with
her
eyes
so
full
of
tears
and
heart
so
full
of
joy
that
she
could
not
speak
when
she
come
in
that
it
made
me
weep
too
i
protest
that
i
was
not
able
to
speak
to
her
which
i
would
have
done
to
have
diverted
her
tears
his
wife
a
good
woman
and
so
sober
and
substantiall
as
i
was
never
more
pleased
any
where
so
thence
took
leave
and
he
with
us
through
the
city
where
in
walking
i
find
the
city
pay
him
great
respect
and
he
the
like
to
the
meanest
which
pleased
me
mightily
he
showed
us
the
place
where
the
merchants
meet
here
and
a
fine
cross
yet
standing
like
cheapside
and
so
to
the
where
paid
the
reckoning
we
back
and
by
moonshine
to
the
bath
again
about
ten
bad
way
and
giving
the
coachman
went
all
of
us
to
bed
sunday
up
and
walked
up
and
down
the
town
and
saw
a
pretty
good
and
many
good
streets
and
very
fair
and
so
to
the
great
church
and
there
saw
bishop
montagu
tomb
and
when
placed
did
there
see
many
brave
people
come
and
among
others
two
men
brought
in
litters
and
set
down
in
the
chancel
to
hear
but
i
did
not
know
one
face
here
a
good
organ
but
a
vain
pragmatical
fellow
preached
a
ridiculous
affected
sermon
that
made
me
angry
and
some
gentlemen
that
sat
next
me
and
sang
well
so
home
walking
round
the
walls
of
the
city
which
are
good
and
the
battlements
all
whole
to
this
church
again
to
see
it
and
look
over
the
monuments
where
among
others
venner
and
pelling
and
a
lady
of
sir
waller
jane
sole
daughter
of
sir
richard
reynell
he
lying
with
his
face
broken
my
landlord
did
give
me
a
good
account
of
the
antiquity
of
this
town
and
wells
and
of
two
heads
on
two
pillars
in
wells
church
monday
looked
into
the
baths
and
find
the
king
and
queene
full
of
a
mixed
sort
of
good
and
bad
and
the
cross
only
almost
for
the
gentry
so
home
with
my
wife
and
did
pay
my
guides
two
women
one
man
poor
woman
to
lay
my
so
to
our
inne
and
there
eat
and
paid
reckoning
servants
poor
lent
the
coachman
before
i
took
coach
i
went
to
make
a
boy
dive
in
the
king
bath
i
paid
also
for
my
coach
and
a
horse
to
bristoll
took
coach
and
away
without
any
of
the
company
of
the
other
that
go
out
of
this
town
day
and
rode
all
day
with
some
trouble
for
fear
of
our
being
out
of
our
way
over
the
downes
where
the
life
of
the
shepherds
is
in
fair
weather
only
pretty
in
the
afternoon
come
to
abury
where
seeing
great
stones
like
those
of
stonehenge
standing
up
i
stopped
and
took
a
countryman
of
that
town
and
he
carried
me
and
showed
me
a
place
trenched
in
like
old
sarum
almost
with
great
stones
pitched
in
it
some
bigger
than
those
at
stonehenge
in
figure
to
my
great
admiration
and
he
told
me
that
most
people
of
learning
coming
by
do
come
and
view
them
and
that
the
king
did
so
and
the
mount
cast
hard
by
is
called
selbury
from
one
king
seall
buried
there
as
tradition
says
i
did
give
this
man
so
took
coach
again
seeing
one
place
with
great
high
stones
pitched
round
which
i
believe
was
once
some
particular
building
in
some
measure
like
that
of
stonehenge
but
about
a
mile
off
it
was
prodigious
to
see
how
full
the
downes
are
of
great
stones
and
all
along
the
vallies
stones
of
considerable
bigness
most
of
them
growing
certainly
out
of
the
ground
so
thick
as
to
cover
the
ground
which
makes
me
think
the
less
of
the
wonder
of
stonehenge
for
hence
they
might
undoubtedly
supply
themselves
with
stones
as
well
as
those
at
abury
in
my
way
did
give
to
the
poor
and
menders
of
the
highway
before
night
come
to
marlborough
and
lay
at
the
hart
a
good
house
and
a
pretty
fair
town
for
a
street
or
two
and
what
is
most
singular
is
their
houses
on
one
side
having
their
houses
supported
with
pillars
which
makes
it
a
good
walk
all
the
five
coaches
that
come
this
day
from
bath
as
well
as
we
were
gone
out
of
the
town
before
six
tuesday
after
paying
the
reckoning
and
servants
poor
set
out
and
passing
through
a
good
part
of
this
country
of
wiltshire
saw
a
good
house
littlecote
of
alexander
popham
for
bath
and
another
of
my
lord
craven
hampstead
marshal
since
destroyed
by
fire
i
think
in
barkeshire
come
to
newbery
and
there
dined
and
musick
a
song
of
the
old
courtier
of
queene
elizabeth
and
how
he
was
changed
upon
the
coming
in
of
the
king
did
please
me
mightily
and
i
did
cause
hewer
to
write
it
out
then
comes
the
reckoning
forced
to
change
gold
servants
and
poor
so
out
and
lost
our
way
but
come
into
it
again
and
in
the
evening
betimes
come
to
reding
and
i
to
walk
about
the
town
which
is
a
very
great
one
i
think
bigger
than
salisbury
a
river
runs
through
it
in
seven
branches
which
unite
in
one
in
one
part
of
the
town
and
runs
into
the
thames
off
one
odd
sign
of
the
broad
face
then
to
my
inn
and
so
to
bed
wednesday
rose
and
paying
the
reckoning
servants
and
poor
musick
the
worst
we
have
had
coming
to
our
but
calling
us
by
wrong
names
so
set
out
with
one
coach
in
company
and
through
maydenhead
which
i
never
saw
before
to
colebrooke
by
noon
the
way
mighty
good
and
there
dined
and
fitted
ourselves
a
little
to
go
through
london
anon
thence
pleasant
way
to
london
before
night
and
and
all
very
well
to
great
content
and
saw
sir
pen
who
is
well
again
i
hear
of
the
ill
news
by
the
great
fire
at
barbadoes
i
did
receive
a
hint
or
two
from
my
lord
anglesy
as
if
he
thought
much
of
my
taking
the
ayre
as
i
have
done
but
i
care
not
but
whatever
the
matter
is
i
think
he
hath
some
to
me
or
at
least
an
opinion
that
i
am
more
the
servant
of
the
board
than
i
am
to
my
lady
peterborough
who
tells
me
among
other
things
her
lord
good
words
to
the
duke
of
york
lately
about
my
lord
sandwich
and
that
the
duke
of
york
is
kind
to
my
lord
sandwich
which
i
am
glad
to
hear
between
two
and
three
in
the
morning
we
were
waked
with
the
maids
crying
out
fire
fire
in
so
i
rose
and
looked
out
and
it
was
dreadful
and
strange
apprehensions
in
me
and
us
all
of
being
presently
burnt
so
we
all
rose
and
my
care
presently
was
to
secure
my
gold
and
plate
and
papers
and
could
quickly
have
done
it
but
i
went
forth
to
see
where
it
was
and
the
whole
town
was
presently
in
the
streets
and
i
found
it
in
a
house
that
stood
alone
in
over
against
the
which
burned
furiously
the
house
not
yet
quite
finished
and
the
benefit
of
brick
was
well
seen
for
it
burnt
all
inward
and
fell
down
within
itself
so
no
fear
of
doing
more
hurt
yesterday
i
heard
how
my
lord
ashly
is
like
to
die
having
some
imposthume
in
his
breast
that
he
hath
been
fain
to
be
cut
into
the
body
to
white
hall
were
we
attended
the
duke
of
york
in
his
closet
upon
our
usual
business
and
thence
out
and
did
see
many
of
the
knights
of
the
garter
with
the
king
and
duke
of
york
going
into
the
to
elect
the
elector
of
saxony
in
that
order
who
i
did
hear
the
duke
of
york
say
was
a
good
drinker
i
know
not
upon
what
score
this
compliment
is
done
him
with
balty
to
james
and
there
presented
him
to
wren
about
his
being
this
year
which
will
be
done
so
up
to
wait
on
the
duke
of
york
and
thence
with
sir
coventry
walked
to
white
hall
good
discourse
about
the
navy
where
want
of
money
undoes
us
thence
to
the
in
but
met
with
nobody
but
sir
philip
howard
who
shamed
me
before
the
whole
house
there
in
commendation
of
my
speech
in
parliament
to
the
king

and
saw
an
act
or
two

play

my
lord
brouncker
where

the
royall

there
heard
harry
howard
noble
offers
about
ground
for
our
college
and
his
intentions
of
building
his
own
house
there
most
nobly
my
business
was
to
meet
boyle
which
i
did
and
discoursed
about
my
eyes
and
he
did
give
me
the
best
advice
he
could
but
refers
me
to
one
turberville
daubigney
turberville
of
oriel
college
created
at
oxford
of
salisbury
lately
come
to
town
who
i
will
go
to
thence
home
where
the
streets
full
at
our
end
of
the
town
removing
their
wine
against
the
act
begins
which
will
be
two
days
hence
to
raise
the
price
to
turberville
about
my
eyes
whom
i
met
with
and
he
did
discourse
i
thought
learnedly
about
them
and
takes
time
before
he
did
prescribe
me
any
thing
to
think
of
it
creed
and
colonel
atkins
come
to
me
about
sending
coals
to
tangier
and
upon
that
most
of
the
morning
much
talk
of
the
french
setting
out
their
fleet
afresh
but
i
hear
nothing
that
our
king
is
alarmed
at
it
at
all
but
rather
making
his
fleet
less
to
turberville
and
there
did
receive
a
direction
for
some
physic
and
also
a
glass
of
something
to
drop
into
my
eyes
he
gives
me
hopes
that
i
may
do
well
then
to
white
hall
where
i
find
the
duke
of
york
in
the
and
the
officers
of
the
navy
were
called
in
about
navy
business
about
calling
in
of
more
ships
the
king
of
france
having
as
the
duke
of
york
says
ordered
his
fleet
to
come
in
notwithstanding
what
he
had
lately
ordered
for
their
staying
abroad
thence
to
the
chapel
it
being
peter
day
and
did
hear
an
anthem
of
silas
taylor
making
a
dull
thing
of
six
and
seven
parts
that
nobody
could
understand
and
the
duke
of
york
when
he
came
out
told
me
that
he
was
a
better
storekeeper
than
and
that
was
bad
enough
too
this
morning
may
showed
me
the
king
new
buildings
at
white
hall
very
fine
and
among
other
things
his
cielings
and
his
houses
of
office
july
to
white
hall
and
so
to
james
where
we
met
and
much
business
with
the
duke
of
york
and
i
find
the
duke
of
york
very
hot
for
regulations
in
the
navy
and
i
believe
is
put
on
it
by
sir
coventry
and
i
am
glad
of
it
and
particularly
he
falls
heavy
on
and
is
vexed
that
lord
anglesy
did
the
other
day
complain
at
the
of
disorders
in
the
navy
and
not
to
him
so
i
to
white
hall
to
a
committee
of
tangier
and
there
vexed
with
the
importunity
and
clamours
of
alderman
backewell
for
my
acquittance
for
money
by
him
supplied
to
the
garrison
before
i
have
any
order
for
paying
it
so
home
calling
at
several
places
among
others
the
and
on
cooper
to
know
when
my
wife
shall
come
and
sit
for
her
picture
to
commissioners
of
accounts
at
the
first
time
i
was
ever
there
and
found
sir
turner
in
the
chair
and
present
lord
halifax
thomas
gregory
dunster
and
osborne
i
long
with
them
and
see
them
hot
set
on
this
matter
but
i
did
give
them
proper
and
safe
answers
halifax
i
perceive
was
industrious
on
my
side
on
behalf
of
his
uncle
coventry
it
being
the
business
of
sir
warren
vexed
only
at
their
denial
of
a
copy
of
what
i
set
my
hand
to
and
swore
to
an
alehouse
met
pierce
the
surgeon
and
clerke
waldron
thomas
waldron
of
baliol
college
created
at
oxford
afterwards
physician
in
ordinary
to
charles
ii
turberville
my
physician
for
the
eyes
and
lowre
probably
richard
lower
of
christ
church
admitted
bachelor
of
physic
at
oxford
to
dissect
several
eyes
of
sheep
and
oxen
with
great
pleasure
and
to
my
great
information
but
strange
that
this
turberville
should
be
so
great
a
man
and
yet
to
this
day
had
seen
no
eyes
dissected
or
but
once
but
desired
this
lowre
to
give
him
the
opportunity
to
see
him
dissect
some
up
and
to
see
sir
coventry
and
give
him
an
account
of
my
doings
yesterday
which
he
well
liked
of
and
was
told
thereof
by
my
lord
halifax
before
but
i
do
perceive
he
is
much
concerned
for
this
business
gives
me
advice
to
write
a
smart
letter
to
the
duke
of
york
about
the
want
of
money
in
the
navy
and
desire
him
to
communicate
it
to
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
for
he
tells
me
he
hath
hot
work
sometimes
to
contend
with
the
rest
for
the
navy
they
being
all
concerned
for
some
other
part
of
the
king
expenses
which
they
would
prefer
to
this
of
the
navy
he
showed
me
his
closet
with
his
for
him
to
sit
in
the
middle
very
convenient
and
i
borrowed
several
books
of
him
to
collect
things
out
of
the
navy
which
i
have
not
with
sir
coventry
and
we
walked
in
the
park
together
a
good
while
he
mighty
kind
to
me
and
hear
many
pretty
stories
of
my
lord
chancellor
being
heretofore
made
sport
of
by
peter
talbot
the
priest
in
his
story
of
the
death
of
cardinal
bleau
by
lord
cottington
in
his
dolor
de
las
tripas
and
tom
killigrew
in
his
being
bred
in
and
now
bound
prentice
to
lord
cottington
going
to
spain
with
and
two
suits
of
clothes
thence
to
cooper
and
there
met
my
wife
and
hewer
and
deb
and
there
my
wife
first
sat
for
her
picture
but
he
is
a
most
admirable
workman
and
good
company
here
comes
harris
and
first
told
us
how
betterton
is
come
again
upon
the
stage
whereupon
my
wife
and
company
to
the
house
to
see
henry
the
fifth
while
i
to
attend
the
duke
of
york
at
the
committee
of
the
navy
at
the
council
where
some
high
dispute
between
him
and
coventry
about
settling
pensions
upon
all
while
unemployed
coventry
against
it
and
i
think
with
reason
great
doings
at
paris
i
hear
with
their
triumphs
for
their
late
conquests
the
duchesse
of
richmond
sworn
last
week
of
the
queene
bedchamber
and
the
king
minding
little
else
but
what
he
used
to
do
about
his
women
we
are
fain
to
go
round
by
newgate
because
of
being
under
rebuilding
to
sir
coventry
and
there
discoursed
of
several
things
and
i
find
him
much
concerned
in
the
present
enquiries
now
on
foot
of
the
commissioners
of
accounts
though
he
reckons
himself
and
the
rest
very
safe
but
vexed
to
see
us
liable
to
these
troubles
in
things
wherein
we
have
laboured
to
do
best
thence
he
being
to
go
out
of
town
to
drink
banbury
waters
i
to
the
duke
of
york
to
attend
him
about
business
of
the
office
and
find
him
mighty
free
to
me
and
how
he
is
concerned
to
mend
things
in
the
navy
himself
and
not
leave
it
to
other
people
so
home
to
dinner
sad
then
with
my
wife
to
cooper
and
there
saw
her
sit
and
he
do
extraordinary
things
indeed
so
to
white
hall
and
there
by
and
by
the
duke
of
york
comes
to
the
chamber
and
spent
with
us
three
hours
till
night
in
hearing
the
business
of
the
of
chatham
and
the
keeper
of
woolwich
and
resolves
to
displace
them
all
so
hot
he
is
of
giving
proofs
of
his
justice
at
this
time
that
it
is
their
great
fate
now
to
come
to
be
questioned
at
such
a
time
as
this
to
cooper
and
there
find
my
wife
and
hewer
and
deb
sitting
and
painting
and
here
he
do
work
finely
though
i
fear
it
will
not
be
so
like
as
i
expected
but
now
i
understand
his
great
skill
in
musick
his
playing
and
setting
to
the
french
lute
most
excellently
and
he
speaks
french
and
indeed
is
an
excellent
man
to
the
king
playhouse
to
see
an
old
play
of
shirly
called
hide
parke
the
first
day
acted
where
horses
are
brought
upon
the
stage
but
it
is
but
a
very
moderate
play
only
an
excellent
epilogue
spoke
by
beck
marshall
to
cooper
and
spent
the
afternoon
with
them
and
it
will
be
an
excellent
picture
this
morning
i
was
let
blood
and
did
bleed
about
fourteen
ounces
towards
curing
my
eyes
this
day
bosse
finished
his
copy
of
my
picture
which
i
confess
i
do
not
admire
though
my
wife
prefers
him
to
browne
nor
do
i
think
it
like
he
does
it
for
hewer
who
hath
my
wife
also
which
i
like
less
at
noon
is
brought
home
the
espinette
i
bought
the
other
day
of
haward
cost
me
my
lady
duchesse
of
monmouth
is
still
lame
and
likely
always
to
be
so
which
is
a
sad
chance
for
a
young
lady
to
get
only
by
trying
of
tricks
in
dancing
to
white
hall
where
waited
on
the
duke
of
york
and
then
the
council
about
the
business
of
tickets
and
i
did
discourse
to
their
liking
only
was
too
high
to
assert
that
nothing
could
be
invented
to
secure
the
king
more
in
the
business
of
tickets
than
there
is
which
the
duke
of
buckingham
did
except
against
and
i
could
have
answered
but
forbore
but
all
liked
very
well
they
say
the
king
of
france
is
making
a
war
again
in
flanders
with
the
king
of
spain
the
king
of
spain
refusing
to
give
him
all
that
he
says
was
promised
him
in
that
treaty
come
cooper
hales
harris
butler
that
wrote
hudibras
and
cooper
cosen
jacke
and
by
and
by
come
reeves
and
his
wife
whom
i
never
saw
before
and
there
we
dined
a
good
dinner
and
company
that
pleased
me
mightily
being
all
eminent
men
in
their
way
spent
all
the
afternoon
in
talk
and
mirth
and
in
the
evening
parted
to
visit
my
lord
crewe
who
is
very
sick
to
great
danger
by
an
erisypelas
the
first
day
i
heard
of
it
went
to
my
and
there
spent
an
hour
about
contriving
my
little
plates
for
my
books
of
the
king
four
yards
attending
at
the
committee
of
the
navy
about
the
old
business
of
tickets
where
the
only
expedient
they
have
found
is
to
bind
the
commanders
and
officers
by
oaths
the
duke
of
york
told
me
how
the
duke
of
buckingham
after
the
council
the
other
day
did
make
mirth
at
my
position
about
the
sufficiency
of
present
rules
in
the
business
of
tickets
and
here
i
took
occasion
to
desire
a
private
discourse
with
the
duke
of
york
and
he
granted
it
me
on
friday
next
up
and
by
water
to
james
having
by
the
way
shown
symson
sir
coventry
in
order
to
the
making
me
one
and
there
after
the
duke
of
york
was
ready
he
called
me
to
his
closet
and
there
i
did
long
and
largely
show
him
the
weakness
of
our
office
and
did
give
him
advice
to
call
us
to
account
for
our
duties
which
he
did
take
mighty
well
and
desired
me
to
draw
up
what
i
would
have
him
write
to
the
office
i
did
lay
open
the
whole
failings
of
the
office
and
how
it
was
his
duty
to
fine
them
and
to
find
fault
with
them
as
admiral
especially
at
this
time
which
he
agreed
to
and
seemed
much
to
rely
on
what
i
said
to
see
my
lord
crewe
whom
i
find
up
and
did
wait
on
him
but
his
face
sore
but
in
hopes
to
do
now
very
well
again
thence
to
cooper
where
my
wife
picture
almost
done
and
mighty
fine
indeed
so
over
the
water
with
my
wife
and
deb
and
mercer
to
and
there
eat
and
walked
and
observe
how
rude
some
of
the
young
gallants
of
the
town
are
become
to
go
into
people
arbors
where
there
are
not
men
and
almost
force
the
women
which
troubled
me
to
see
the
confidence
of
the
vice
of
the
age
and
so
we
away
by
water
with
much
pleasure
home
to
white
hall
there
met
with
may
who
was
giving
directions
about
making
a
close
way
for
people
to
go
dry
from
the
gate
up
into
the
house
to
prevent
their
going
through
the
galleries
which
will
be
very
good
i
staid
and
talked
with
him
about
the
state
of
the
king
offices
in
general
and
how
ill
he
is
served
and
do
still
find
him
an
excellent
person
with
ashburnham
and
i
made
him
admire
my
drawing
a
thing
presently
in
shorthand
but
god
knows
i
have
paid
dear
for
it
in
my
eyes
to
the
king
house
to
see
the
first
day
of
lacy
monsieur
ragou
now
new
acted
the
king
and
court
all
there
and
mighty
merry
a
farce
the
month
ends
mighty
sadly
with
me
my
eyes
being
now
past
all
use
almost
and
i
am
mighty
hot
upon
trying
the
late
printed
experiment
of
paper
tubes
august
to
the
duke
of
york
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
guardian
formerly
the
same
i
find
that
was
called
cutter
of
a
silly
play
and
thence
to
westminster
hall
where
i
met
fitzgerald
and
with
him
to
a
tavern
to
consider
of
the
instructions
for
sir
thomas
allen
against
his
going
to
algier
he
and
i
being
designed
to
go
down
to
portsmouth
by
the
council
order
morning
so
i
away
home
and
there
bespeak
a
coach
and
so
home
and
to
bed
waked
betimes
and
my
wife
at
an
hour
warning
is
resolved
to
go
with
me
which
pleases
me
her
readiness
but
before
ready
comes
a
letter
from
fitzgerald
that
he
is
seized
upon
last
night
by
a
order
of
the
general
by
a
file
of
musqueteers
and
kept
prisoner
ill
his
chamber
the
duke
of
york
did
tell
me
of
it
day
it
is
about
a
quarrel
between
him
and
witham
and
they
fear
a
challenge
so
i
to
him
and
sent
my
wife
by
the
coach
round
to
lambeth
i
lost
my
labour
going
to
his
lodgings
and
he
in
bed
and
staying
a
great
while
for
him
i
at
last
grew
impatient
and
would
stay
no
longer
but
to
james
to
wren
to
bid
him
god
be
with
you
and
so
over
the
water
to
fox
hall
and
there
my
wife
and
deb
took
me
up
and
we
away
to
gilford
losing
our
way
for
three
or
four
miles
about
cobham
at
gilford
we
dined
and
i
showed
them
the
hospitall
there
of
bishop
abbot
george
abbot
archbishop
of
canterbury
ob
and
his
tomb
in
the
church
which
and
the
rest
of
the
tombs
there
are
kept
mighty
clean
and
neat
with
curtains
before
them
so
to
coach
again
and
got
to
lippook
late
over
hindhead
having
an
old
man
a
guide
in
the
coach
with
us
but
got
thither
with
great
fear
of
being
out
of
our
way
it
being
ten
at
night
here
good
honest
people
and
after
supper
to
bed
to
coach
and
with
a
guide
to
petersfield
where
i
find
sir
thomas
allen
and
tippets
john
tippet
a
surveyor
of
the
navy
afterwards
knighted
come
the
first
about
the
business
the
latter
only
in
respect
to
me
as
also
fitzgerald
who
came
post
all
last
night
and
newly
arrived
here
we
four
sat
down
presently
to
our
business
and
in
an
hour
despatched
all
our
talk
and
did
inform
sir
thomas
allen
well
in
it
who
i
perceive
in
serious
matters
is
a
serious
man
and
tells
me
he
wishes
all
we
are
told
be
true
in
our
defence
for
he
finds
by
all
that
the
turkes
have
to
this
day
been
very
civil
to
our
merchantmen
every
where
and
if
they
would
have
broke
with
us
they
never
had
such
an
opportunity
over
our
rich
merchantmen
as
lately
coming
out
of
the
streights
then
to
dinner
and
pretty
merry
and
here
was
martin
the
purser
who
dined
with
us
and
wrote
some
things
for
us
and
so
took
coach
again
back
fitzgerald
with
us
whom
i
was
pleased
with
all
the
day
with
his
discourse
of
his
observations
abroad
as
being
a
great
soldier
and
of
long
standing
abroad
and
knows
all
things
and
persons
abroad
very
well
i
mean
the
great
soldiers
of
france
and
spain
and
germany
and
talkes
very
well
came
at
night
to
gilford
where
the
red
lyon
so
full
of
people
and
a
wedding
that
the
master
of
the
house
did
get
us
a
lodging
over
the
way
at
a
private
house
his
landlord
mighty
neat
and
fine
and
there
supped
and
so
bed
i
hear
that
colbert
the
french
ambassador
is
come
and
hath
been
at
court
ingognito
when
he
hath
his
audience
i
know
not
waited
on
the
duke
of
york
and
both
by
him
and
several
of
the
beyond
expectation
i
find
that
my
going
to
sir
thomas
allen
was
looked
upon
as
a
thing
necessary
and
i
have
got
some
advantage
by
it
among
them
to
my
lord
arlington
house
the
first
time
since
he
came
thither
at
a
very
fine
noble
place
and
there
he
received
me
in
sight
of
several
lords
with
great
respect
i
did
give
him
an
account
of
my
journey
and
here
while
i
waited
for
him
a
little
my
lord
orrery
took
notice
of
me
and
begun
discourse
of
hangings
and
of
the
improvement
of
shipping
i
not
thinking
that
he
knew
me
but
did
then
discover
it
was
a
mighty
compliment
of
my
abilities
and
ingenuity
which
i
am
mighty
proud
of
and
he
do
speak
most
excellently
to
cooper
where
i
spent
all
the
afternoon
with
my
wife
and
girl
seeing
him
make
an
end
of
her
picture
which
he
did
to
my
great
content
though
not
so
great
as
i
confess
i
expected
being
not
satisfied
in
the
greatness
of
the
resemblance
nor
in
the
blue
garment
but
it
is
most
certainly
a
most
rare
piece
of
work
as
to
the
painting
he
hath
for
his
work
and
the
chrystal
and
case
and
gold
case
comes
to
and
which
i
sent
him
this
night
that
i
might
be
out
of
his
debt
the
parliament
met
enough
to
adjourne
to
the
of
november
next
at
the
office
all
the
afternoon
till
night
being
mightily
pleased
with
a
trial
i
have
made
of
the
use
of
a
spectacall
of
paper
tried
with
my
right
eye
this
day
i
hear
that
to
the
great
joy
of
the
the
time
is
out
of
the
act
against
them
so
that
they
may
meet
and
they
have
declared
that
they
will
have
a
morning
lecture
up
again
which
is
pretty
strange
and
they
are
connived
at
by
the
king
every
where
i
hear
in
the
city
and
country
this
afternoon
my
wife
and
mercer
and
deb
went
with
pelling
to
see
the
gypsies
at
lambeth
and
have
their
fortunes
told
but
what
they
did
i
did
not
enquire
captain
cocke
tells
me
that
he
hears
for
certain
the
duke
of
york
will
lose
the
authority
of
an
admirall
and
be
governed
by
a
committee
and
all
our
office
changed
only
they
are
in
dispute
whether
i
shall
continue
or
no
which
puts
new
thoughts
in
me
but
i
know
not
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
i
with
wren
by
invitation
to
sir
stephen
fox
to
dinner
where
the
cofferer
and
sir
edward
savage
where
many
good
stories
of
the
antiquity
and
estates
of
many
families
at
this
day
in
cheshire
and
that
part
of
the
kingdom
more
than
what
is
on
this
side
near
london
my
lady
dining
with
us
a
very
good
lady
and
a
family
governed
so
nobly
and
neatly
as
do
me
good
to
see
it
thence
the
cofferer
sir
stephen
and
i
to
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
about
business
and
so
i
up
to
the
duke
of
york
who
enquired
for
what
i
had
promised
him
about
my
observations
of
the
miscarriages
of
our
office
and
i
told
him
he
should
have
it
next
week
being
glad
he
called
for
it
for
i
find
he
is
concerned
to
do
something
and
to
secure
himself
thereby
i
believe
for
the
world
is
labouring
to
eclipse
him
i
doubt
i
mean
the
factious
part
of
the
parliament
the
office
met
this
afternoon
as
usual
and
waited
on
him
where
among
other
things
he
talked
a
great
while
of
his
intentions
of
going
to
dover
soon
to
be
sworn
as
lord
warden

is
a
matter
of
great
ceremony
and
state

the
morning

my
office

hewer

up
my
report
to

with
their
mighty
rich
and
his
coaches
he
being
to
have
his
entry
but
his
things
though
rich
are
not
new
supposed
to
be
the
same
his
brother
had
the
other
day
at
the
treaty
at
in
flanders
alone
to
the
park
but
there
were
few
coaches
among
the
few
there
were
our
two
great
beauties
my
lady
castlemaine
and
richmond
the
first
time
i
saw
the
latter
since
she
had
the
small
pox
i
had
much
pleasure
to
see
them
but
i
thought
they
were
strange
one
to
another
to
work
till
past
twelve
at
night
that
i
might
get
my
great
letter
to
the
duke
of
york
ready
against
which
i
shall
do
to
my
great
content
up
betimes
and
with
my
people
again
to
work
and
finished
all
before
noon
and
then
i
by
water
to
white
hall
and
there
did
tell
the
duke
of
york
that
i
had
done
and
he
hath
desired
me
to
come
to
him
at
sunday
next
in
the
afternoon
to
read
it
over
by
which
i
have
more
time
to
consider
and
correct
it
to
james
and
by
and
by
comes
monsieur
colbert
the
french
ambassador
to
make
his
first
visit
to
the
duke
of
york
and
then
to
the
duchesse
and
i
saw
it
a
silly
piece
of
ceremony
he
saying
only
a
few
formal
words
a
comely
man
and
in
a
black
suit
and
cloak
of
silk
which
is
a
strange
fashion
now
it
hath
been
so
long
left
off
this
day
i
did
first
see
the
duke
of
york
room
of
pictures
of
some
maids
of
honour
done
by
lilly
good
but
not
like
to
the
and
thence
home
and
took
in
my
way
walking
down
and
to
see
how
very
fine
a
descent
they
have
now
made
down
the
hill
that
it
is
become
very
easy
and
pleasant
to
church
and
heard
a
good
sermon
of
gifford
at
our
church
upon
seek
ye
first
the
kingdom
of
heaven
and
its
righteousness
and
all
things
shall
be
added
to
you
a
very
excellent
and
persuasive
good
and
moral
sermon
he
showed
like
a
wise
man
that
righteousness
is
a
surer
moral
way
of
being
rich
than
sin
and
villany
after
dinner
to
the
office
gibson
and
i
to
examine
my
letter
to
the
duke
of
york
which
to
my
great
joy
i
did
very
well
by
my
paper
tube
without
pain
to
my
eyes
and
i
do
mightily
like
what
i
have
therein
done
and
did
according
to
the
duke
of
york
order
make
haste
to
james
and
about
four
got
thither
and
there
the
duke
of
york
was
ready
expecting
me
and
did
hear
it
all
over
with
extraordinary
content
and
did
give
me
many
and
hearty
thanks
and
in
words
the
most
expressive
tell
me
his
sense
of
my
good
endeavours
and
that
he
would
have
a
care
of
me
on
all
occasions
and
did
with
much
inwardness
tell
me
what
was
doing
suitable
almost
to
what
captain
cocke
tells
me
of
designs
to
make
alterations
in
the
navy
and
is
most
open
to
me
in
them
and
with
utmost
confidence
desires
my
further
advice
on
all
occasions
and
he
resolves
to
have
my
letter
transcribed
and
sent
forthwith
to
the
office
so
with
as
much
satisfaction
as
i
could
possibly
or
did
hope
for
and
obligation
on
the
duke
of
york
side
professed
to
me
i
away
up
and
by
water
to
james
and
there
with
wren
did
discourse
about
my
great
letter
which
the
duke
of
york
hath
given
him
and
he
hath
set
it
to
be
transcribed
by
billings
his
man
whom
as
be
tells
me
he
can
most
confide
in
for
secresy
and
is
much
pleased
with
it
and
earnest
to
have
it
be
and
he
and
i
are
like
to
be
much
together
in
the
considering
how
to
reform
the
office
and
that
by
the
duke
of
york
command
thence
i
mightily
pleased
with
this
success
away
to
the
office
where
all
the
morning
my
head
full
of
this
business
and
it
is
pretty
how
lord
brouncker
this
day
did
tell
me
how
he
hears
that
a
design
is
on
foot
to
remove
us
out
of
the
office
and
proposes
that
we
two
do
agree
to
draw
up
a
form
of
new
constitution
of
the
office
there
to
provide
remedies
for
the
evils
we
are
now
under
that
so
we
may
be
beforehand
with
the
world
which
i
agreed
to
saying
nothing
of
my
design
and
the
truth
is
he
is
the
best
man
of
them
all
and
i
would
be
glad
next
myself
to
save
him
for
as
he
deserves
best
so
i
doubt
he
needs
his
place
most
it
is
strange
to
see
with
what
speed
the
people
employed
do
pull
down
paul
steeple
and
with
what
ease
it
is
said
that
it
and
the
quire
are
to
be
taken
down
this
year
and
another
church
begun
in
the
room
thereof
the
next
home
by
coach
with
sir
gauden
who
by
the
way
tells
me
how
the
city
do
go
on
in
several
things
towards
the
building
of
the
public
places
which
i
am
glad
to
hear
and
gives
hope
that
in
a
few
years
it
will
be
a
glorious
place
but
we
met
with
several
stops
and
troubles
in
the
way
in
the
streets
so
as
makes
it
bad
to
travel
in
the
dark
now
through
the
city
so
i
to
batelier
by
appointment
where
i
find
my
wife
and
deb
and
mercer
pierce
and
her
husband
son
and
daughter
and
knipp
and
harris
and
batelier
and
his
sister
mary
and
cosen
gumbleton
a
fat
young
gentleman
son
to
the
jeweller
that
dances
well
and
here
danced
all
night
long
with
a
noble
supper
and
about
two
in
the
morning
the
table
spread
again
for
a
noble
breakfast
beyond
all
moderation
and
then
broke
up
to
james
and
there
with
wren
did
correct
his
copy
of
my
letter
which
the
duke
of
york
hath
signed
in
my
very
words
without
alteration
of
a
syllable
and
so
pleased
therewith
i
to
my
lord
brouncker
who
i
find
within
but
hath
business
and
so
comes
not
to
the
office
and
so
i
by
water
to
the
office
where
we
sat
all
the
morning
and
just
as
the
board
rises
comes
the
duke
of
york
letter
which
i
knowing
and
the
board
not
being
full
and
desiring
rather
to
have
the
duke
of
york
deliver
it
himself
to
us
i
suppressed
it
for
this
day
my
heart
beginning
to
falsify
in
this
business
as
being
doubtful
of
the
trouble
it
may
give
me
by
provoking
them
but
however
i
am
resolved
to
go
through
it
and
it
is
too
late
to
help
it
now
at
noon
to
dinner
to
captain
cocke
where
i
met
with
wren
my
going
being
to
tell
him
what
i
have
done
which
he
likes
and
to
confer
with
cocke
about
our
office
who
tells
me
that
he
is
confident
the
design
of
removing
our
officers
do
hold
but
that
he
is
sure
that
i
am
safe
enough
so
away
home
and
there
met
at
sir
richard
ford
with
the
duke
of
commissioners
about
our
prizes
with
whom
we
shall
have
some
trouble
before
we
make
an
end
with
them
to
white
hall
where
the
duke
of
york
did
call
me
aside
and
told
me
that
he
must
speak
with
me
in
the
afternoon
and
with
wren
for
that
now
he
hath
got
the
paper
from
my
lord
keeper
about
the
exceptions
taken
against
the
management
of
the
navy
and
so
we
are
to
debate
upon
answering
them
at
noon
i
home
with
sir
coventry
to
his
house
and
there
dined
with
him
and
talked
freely
with
him
and
did
acquaint
him
with
what
i
have
done
which
he
is
well
pleased
with
and
glad
of
and
do
tell
me
that
there
are
endeavours
on
foot
to
bring
the
navy
into
new
but
he
fears
worse
hands
the
duke
of
york
fell
to
work
with
us
the
committee
being
gone
in
the
and
there
with
his
own
hand
did
give
us
his
long
letter
telling
us
that
he
had
received
several
from
us
and
now
did
give
us
one
from
him
taking
notice
of
our
several
doubts
and
failures
and
desired
answer
to
it
as
he
therein
desired
this
pleased
me
well
and
so
fell
to
other
business
and
then
parted
and
the
duke
of
york
and
wren
and
i
it
being
now
into
the
duke
of
york
closet
in
white
hall
and
there
read
over
this
paper
of
my
lord
keeper
wherein
are
laid
down
the
faults
of
the
navy
so
silly
and
the
remedies
so
ridiculous
or
else
the
same
that
are
now
already
provided
that
we
thought
it
not
to
need
any
answer
the
duke
of
york
being
able
himself
to
do
it
that
so
it
makes
us
admire
the
confidence
of
these
men
to
offer
things
so
silly
in
a
business
of
such
moment
but
it
is
a
most
perfect
instance
of
the
complexion
of
the
times
and
so
the
duke
of
york
said
himself
who
i
perceive
is
mightily
concerned
in
it
and
do
again
and
again
recommend
it
to
wren
and
me
together
to
consider
upon
remedies
fit
to
provide
for
him
to
propound
to
the
king
before
the
rest
of
the
world
and
particularly
the
commissioners
of
accounts
who
are
men
of
understanding
and
order
to
find
our
faults
and
offer
remedies
of
their
own
which
i
am
glad
of
and
will
endeavour
to
do
something
in
it
so
parted
and
with
much
difficulty
by
walked
over
the
matted
gallery
as
it
is
now
with
the
mats
and
boards
all
taken
up
so
that
we
walked
over
the
rafters
but
strange
to
see
how
hard
matter
the
plaister
of
paris
is
that
is
there
taken
up
as
hard
as
stone
and
pity
to
see
holben
work
in
the
ceiling
blotted
on
and
only
whited
over
my
wife
this
day
with
hales
to
sit
for
her
hand
to
be
mended
in
her
picture
up
and
all
the
morning
at
the
office
where
the
duke
of
york
long
letter
was
read
to
their
great
trouble
and
their
suspecting
me
to
have
been
the
writer
of
it
and
at
noon
comes
by
appointment
harris
to
dine
with
me
and
after
dinner
he
and
i
to
where
they
are
building
it
new
very
fine
and
there
to
see
their
theatre
which
stood
all
the
fire
and
which
was
our
business
their
great
picture
of
holben
thinking
to
have
bought
it
by
the
help
of
pierce
for
a
little
money
i
did
think
to
give
for
it
it
being
said
to
be
worth
but
it
is
so
spoiled
that
i
have
no
mind
to
it
and
is
not
a
pleasant
though
a
good
picture
thence
carried
harris
to
his
playhouse
where
though
four
so
few
people
there
are
at
the
impertinents
as
i
went
out
and
do
believe
they
did
not
act
though
there
was
my
lord
arlington
and
his
company
there
so
i
out
and
met
my
wife
in
a
coach
and
stopped
her
going
thither
to
meet
me
and
took
her
and
mercer
and
deb
to
bartholomew
fair
and
there
did
see
a
ridiculous
obscene
little
called
marry
audrey
a
foolish
thing
but
seen
by
every
body
and
so
to
jacob
hall
jacob
hall
the
famous
dancer
was
said
to
have
received
a
salary
from
lady
castlemaine
who
had
become
enamoured
of
him
dancing
on
the
ropes
a
thing
worth
seeing
and
mightily
followed
lord
day
walked
to
james
and
pell
mell
and
read
over
with
sir
coventry
my
long
letter
to
the
duke
of
york
and
which
the
duke
of
york
hath
from
mine
wrote
to
the
board
wherein
he
is
mightily
pleased
and
i
perceive
do
put
great
value
upon
me
and
did
talk
very
openly
on
all
matters
of
state
and
how
some
people
have
got
the
bill
into
their
mouths
meaning
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
his
party
and
would
likely
run
away
with
all
but
what
pleased
me
mightily
was
to
hear
the
good
character
he
did
give
of
my
lord
falmouth
for
his
generosity
desire
of
public
good
and
low
thoughts
of
his
own
wisdom
his
employing
his
interest
in
the
king
to
do
good
offices
to
all
people
without
any
other
fault
than
the
freedom
he
do
learn
in
france
of
thinking
himself
obliged
to
serve
his
king
in
his
pleasures
and
was
sir
particular
friend
and
sir
coventry
do
tell
me
very
odde
circumstances
about
the
fatality
of
his
death
which
are
very
strange
i
have
read
the
particulars
of
this
prediction
in
a
in
the
pepysian
collection
but
the
reference
to
it
is
unfortunately
mislaid
thence
to
white
hall
to
chapel
and
heard
the
anthem
and
did
dine
with
the
duke
of
albemarle
in
a
dirty
manner
as
ever
all
the
afternoon
i
sauntered
up
and
down
the
house
and
park
and
there
was
a
committee
for
tangier
met
wherein
lord
middleton
would
i
think
have
found
fault
with
me
for
want
of
coles
but
i
slighted
it
and
he
made
nothing
of
it
but
was
thought
to
be
drunk
and
i
see
that
he
hath
a
mind
to
find
fault
with
me
and
creed
neither
of
us
having
yet
applied
ourselves
to
him
about
any
thing
but
do
talk
of
his
profits
and
perquisites
taken
from
him
and
garrison
reduced
and
that
it
must
be
increased
and
such
things
as
i
fear
he
will
be
just
such
another
as
my
lord
tiviott
and
the
rest
to
ruin
that
place
so
i
to
the
park
and
there
walk
an
hour
or
two
and
in
the
garden
and
saw
the
queene
and
ladies
walk
and
i
did
steal
some
apples
off
the
trees
and
here
did
see
my
lady
richmond
who
is
of
a
noble
person
as
ever
i
did
see
but
her
face
worse
than
it
was
considerably
by
the
her
sister
is
also
very
handsome
so
to
white
hall
in
the
evening
to
the
queene
side
and
there
met
the
duke
of
york
and
he
did
tell
me
and
sir
coventry
who
was
with
me
how
the
lord
anglesy
did
take
notice
of
our
reading
his
long
and
sharp
letter
to
the
board
but
that
it
was
the
better
at
least
he
said
so
the
duke
of
york
i
perceive
is
earliest
in
it
and
will
have
good
effects
of
it
telling
sir
coventry
that
it
was
a
letter
that
might
have
come
from
the
commissioners
of
accounts
but
it
was
better
it
should
come
first
from
him
i
met
lord
brouncker
who
i
perceive
and
the
rest
do
smell
that
it
comes
from
me
but
dare
not
find
fault
with
me
and
i
am
glad
of
it
it
being
my
glory
and
defence
that
i
did
occasion
and
write
it
so
by
water
home
and
did
spend
the
evening
with
hewer
telling
him
how
we
are
all
like
to
be
turned
out
lord
brouncker
telling
me
this
evening
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
did
within
few
hours
say
that
he
had
enough
to
turn
us
all
out
which
i
am
not
sorry
for
at
all
for
i
know
the
world
will
judge
me
to
go
for
company
and
my
eyes
are
such
as
i
am
not
able
to
do
the
business
of
my
office
as
i
used
and
would
desire
to
do
while
i
am
in
it
to
the
duke
of
york
playhouse
and
saw
hamlet
which
we
have
not
seen
this
year
before
or
more
and
mightily
pleased
with
it
but
above
all
with
betterton
the
best
part
i
believe
that
ever
man
acted
september
to
the
fair
and
there
saw
several
sights
among
others
the
mare
that
tells
money
and
many
things
to
admiration
for
the
burning
of
london
strictly
observed
to
my
bookseller
for
hobbs
leviathan
which
is
now
mightily
called
for
and
what
was
heretofore
sold
for
i
now
give
at
the
second
hand
and
is
sold
for
it
being
a
book
the
bishops
will
not
let
be
printed
again
to
the
fair
to
see
the
play
with
puppets
and
it
is
an
excellent
play
the
more
i
see
it
the
more
i
love
the
wit
of
it
only
the
business
of
abusing
the
puritans
begins
to
grow
stale
and
of
no
use
they
being
the
people
that
at
last
will
be
found
the
wisest
this
night
knipp
tells
us
that
there
is
a
spanish
woman
lately
come
over
that
pretends
to
sing
as
well
as
knight
a
celebrated
singer
and
favourite
of
charles
il
her
portrait
was
engraved
in
by
faber
after
kneller
there
is
in
waller
poems
a
song
sung
by
knight
to
the
queen
on
her
birthday
both
of
whom
i
must
endeavour
to
hear
to
hales
new
house
where
i
find
he
hath
finished
my
wife
hand
which
is
better
than
the
other
and
here
i
find
harris
picture
done
in
his
habit
of
henry
the
fifth
mighty
like
a
player
but
i
do
not
think
the
picture
near
so
good
as
any
yet
he
hath
made
for
me
however
it
is
pretty
well
with
my
lord
brouncker
who
was
this
day
in
unusual
manner
merry
i
believe
with
drink
minnes
and
pen
to
and
there
saw
the
dancing
mare
again
which
day
i
find
to
act
much
worse
than
the
other
day
she
forgetting
many
things
which
her
master
beat
her
for
and
was
mightily
vexed
and
then
the
dancing
of
the
ropes
and
also
the
little
which
is
very
ridiculous
this
day
i
received
so
earnest
an
invitation
again
from
roger
pepys
to
come
to
that
i
resolve
to
let
my
wife
go
which
she
shall
do
the
next
week
to
the
duke
of
richmond
lodgings
by
his
desire
by
letter
yesterday
i
find
him
at
his
lodgings
in
the
little
building
in
the
at
white
hall
that
was
begun
to
be
built
by
captain
rolt
they
are
fine
rooms
i
did
hope
to
see
his
lady
but
she
i
hear
is
in
the
country
his
business
was
about
his
yacht
and
he
seems
a
mighty
man
and
did
presently
write
me
a
warrant
for
a
doe
from
cobham
when
the
season
comes
buck
season
being
past
i
shall
make
much
of
this
acquaintance
that
i
may
live
to
see
his
lady
near
thence
to
westminster
to
sir
long
office
and
going
met
george
montagu
who
talked
and
complimented
me
mightily
and
a
long
discourse
i
had
with
him
who
for
news
tells
me
for
certain
that
trevor
do
come
to
be
secretary
at
michaelmas
and
that
morrice
goes
out
and
he
believes
without
any
compensation
he
tells
me
that
now
buckingham
do
rule
all
and
the
other
day
in
the
king
journey
he
is
now
in
at
bagshot
and
that
way
he
caused
prince
horses
to
be
turned
out
of
an
inne
and
caused
his
own
to
be
kept
there
which
the
prince
complained
of
to
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
seconded
the
complaint
but
the
king
did
it
for
buckingham
by
which
there
are
high
displeasures
among
them
and
buckingham
and
arlington
rule
all
to
white
hall
where
brouncker
pen
and
i
attended
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
about
the
victualling
contract
where
high
words
between
sir
thomas
clifford
and
us
and
myself
more
particularly
who
told
him
that
something
that
he
said
was
told
him
about
this
business
was
a
flat
untruth
however
we
went
on
to
our
business
in
the
examination
of
the
draught
and
so
parted
and
i
vexed
at
what
happened
lord
day
by
coach
to
james
and
met
to
my
wish
the
duke
of
york
and
wren
and
understand
the
duke
of
york
hath
received
answers
from
brouncker
pen
and
minnes
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
bid
wren
read
them
over
with
me
so
having
no
opportunity
of
talk
with
the
duke
of
york
and
wren
some
business
to
do
he
put
them
into
my
hands
like
an
idle
companion
to
take
home
with
me
before
himself
had
read
them
which
do
give
me
great
opportunity
of
altering
my
answer
if
there
was
cause
after
supper
made
my
wife
to
read
them
all
over
wherein
she
is
mighty
useful
to
me
and
i
find
them
all
evasions
and
in
many
things
false
and
in
few
to
the
full
purpose
little
said
reflective
on
me
though
pen
and
minnes
do
mean
me
in
one
or
two
places
and
minnes
a
little
more
plainly
would
lead
the
duke
of
york
to
question
the
exactness
of
my
keeping
my
records
but
all
to
no
purpose
my
mind
is
mightily
pleased
by
this
if
i
can
but
get
time
to
have
a
copy
taken
of
them
for
my
future
use
but
i
must
return
them
tomorrow
so
to
bed
up
betimes
and
walked
to
the
temple
and
stopped
viewing
the
exchange
and
paul
and
fayth
where
strange
how
the
very
sight
of
the
stones
falling
from
the
top
of
the
steeple
do
make
me
but
no
hurt
i
hear
hath
yet
happened
in
all
this
work
of
the
steeple
which
is
very
much
so
from
the
temple
i
by
coach
to
james
where
i
find
sir
pen
and
lord
anglesy
who
delivered
this
morning
his
answer
to
the
duke
of
york
but
i
could
not
see
it
but
after
being
above
with
the
duke
of
york
i
down
with
wren
and
he
and
i
read
all
over
that
i
had
and
i
expounded
them
to
him
and
did
so
order
it
that
i
had
them
home
with
me
so
that
i
shall
to
my
heart
wish
be
able
to
take
a
copy
of
them
after
dinner
i
by
water
to
white
hall
and
there
with
the
cofferer
and
sir
stephen
fox
attended
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
about
bettering
our
fund
and
are
promised
it
speedily
to
the
king
playhouse
to
see
a
new
play
acted
but
yesterday
a
translation
out
of
french
by
dryden
called
the
ladys
a
la
mode
so
mean
a
thing
as
when
they
come
to
say
it
would
be
acted
again
both
he
that
said
it
beeson
probably
beeston
who
had
been
manager
of
the
cockpit
theatre
and
the
pit
fell
walking
it
to
the
temple
and
in
my
way
observe
that
the
stockes
are
now
pulled
quite
down
and
it
will
make
the
coming
into
cornhill
and
mighty
noble
i
stopped
too
at
paul
and
there
did
go
into
fayth
church
and
also
in
the
body
of
the
west
part
of
the
church
and
do
see
a
hideous
sight
of
the
walls
of
the
church
ready
to
fall
that
i
was
in
fear
as
long
as
i
was
in
it
and
here
i
saw
the
great
vaults
underneath
the
body
of
the
church
no
hurt
i
hear
is
done
yet
since
their
going
to
pull
down
the
church
and
steeple
but
one
man
one
mound
this
week
fell
from
the
top
of
the
roof
of
the
east
end
that
stands
next
the
steeple
and
there
broke
himself
all
to
pieces
it
is
pretty
here
to
see
how
the
late
church
was
but
a
case
wrought
over
the
old
church
for
you
may
see
the
very
old
pillars
standing
whole
within
the
wall
of
this
when
i
come
to
james
i
find
the
duke
of
york
gone
with
the
king
to
see
the
muster
of
the
guards
in
hide
park
and
their
colonell
the
duke
of
monmouth
to
take
his
command
this
day
of
the
by
surrender
of
my
lord
gerard
so
i
took
a
coach
and
saw
it
all
and
indeed
it
was
mighty
noble
and
their
firing
mighty
fine
and
the
duke
of
monmouth
in
mighty
rich
clothes
but
the
well
ordering
of
the
men
i
understand
not
here
among
a
thousand
coaches
that
were
there
i
saw
and
spoke
to
pierce
and
by
and
by
wren
hunts
me
out
and
gives
me
my
lord
anglesy
answer
to
the
duke
of
york
letter
where
i
perceive
he
do
do
what
he
can
to
hurt
me
by
bidding
the
duke
of
york
call
for
my
books
but
this
will
do
me
all
the
right
in
the
world
and
yet
i
am
troubled
at
it
so
away
out
of
the
park
and
home
and
there
gibson
and
i
to
dinner
and
all
the
afternoon
with
him
writing
over
anew
and
a
little
altering
my
answer
to
the
duke
of
york
which
i
have
not
yet
delivered
and
so
have
the
opportunity
of
doing
it
after
seeing
all
their
answers
though
this
do
give
me
occasion
to
alter
very
little
this
done
he
to
write
it
over
and
i
to
the
office
where
late
and
then
home
and
he
had
finished
it
and
then
he
to
read
to
me
the
life
of
archbishop
laud
wrote
by
heylin
which
is
a
shrewd
book
but
that
which
i
believe
will
do
the
bishops
in
general
no
great
good
but
hurt
it
pleads
so
much
for
popery
to
james
and
there
took
a
turn
or
two
in
the
park
and
then
up
to
the
duke
of
york
and
there
had
opportunity
of
delivering
my
answer
to
his
late
letter
which
he
did
not
read
but
give
to
wren
as
looking
on
it
as
a
thing
i
needed
not
have
done
but
only
that
i
might
not
give
occasion
to
the
rest
to
suspect
my
communication
with
the
duke
of
york
against
them
so
now
i
am
at
rest
in
that
matter
and
shall
be
more
when
my
copies
are
finished
of
their
answers
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
silent
woman
the
best
comedy
i
think
that
ever
was
wrote
and
sitting
by
shadwell
thomas
shadwell
the
dramatic
writer
ob
the
poet
he
was
big
with
admiration
of
it
here
was
my
lord
brouncker
and
pen
and
their
ladies
in
the
box
being
grown
roughly
kind
of
a
sudden
but
god
knows
it
will
last
but
a
little
while
i
dare
swear
knipp
did
her
part
mighty
well
all
the
news
now
is
that
trevor
is
for
certain
to
be
secretary
in
morrice
place
which
the
duke
of
york
did
himself
tell
me
yesterday
and
also
that
parliament
is
to
be
adjourned
to
the
of
march
which
do
please
me
well
hoping
thereby
to
get
my
things
in
a
little
better
order
than
i
should
have
done
and
the
less
attendances
at
that
end
of
the
town
in
winter
to
church
and
thence
home
to
dinner
staying
till
past
one
for
harris
whom
i
invited
and
to
bring
shadwell
the
poet
with
him
but
they
came
not
and
so
a
good
dinner
lost
through
my
own
folly
and
so
to
dinner
alone
having
since
church
heard
the
boy
read
over
dryden
reply
to
sir
answer
about
his
essay
of
poesy
and
a
letter
in
answer
to
that
the
last
whereof
is
mighty
silly
in
behalf
of
howard
the
duchesse
of
monmouth
is
at
this
time
in
great
trouble
of
the
shortness
of
her
lame
leg
which
is
likely
to
grow
shorter
and
shorter
that
she
will
never
recover
it
to
james
and
there
the
duke
of
york
did
of
his
own
accord
come
to
me
and
tell
me
that
he
had
read
and
do
like
of
my
answers
to
the
objections
which
he
did
give
me
the
other
day
about
the
navy
and
so
did
sir
coventry
too
who
told
me
that
the
duke
of
york
had
shown
him
them
to
very
dirty
and
there
saw
the
of
whittington
which
was
pretty
to
see
and
how
that
idle
thing
do
work
upon
people
that
see
it
and
even
myself
too
and
thence
to
jacob
hall
dancing
on
the
ropes
where
i
saw
such
action
as
i
never
saw
before
and
mightily
worth
seeing
and
here
took
acquaintance
with
a
fellow
that
carried
me
to
a
tavern
whither
come
the
musick
of
this
booth
and
by
and
by
jacob
hall
himself
with
whom
i
had
a
mind
to
speak
to
hear
whether
he
had
ever
any
mischief
by
falls
in
his
time
he
told
me
yes
many
but
never
to
the
breaking
of
a
limb
he
seems
a
mighty
strong
man
so
giving
them
a
bottle
or
two
of
wine
i
away
so
by
water
by
through
the
bridge
it
being
mighty
dark
but
still
weather
and
so
home
this
day
came
out
first
the
new
in
gold
coined
by
the
guiny
company
and
i
did
get
two
pieces
of
holder
this
day
wren
did
give
me
at
the
board
commissioner
middleton
answer
to
the
duke
of
york
great
letter
so
that
now
i
have
all
of
them
at
noon
comes
evelyn
to
me
about
some
business
with
the
office
and
there
in
discourse
tells
me
of
his
loss
to
the
value
of
which
he
hath
met
with
in
a
late
attempt
of
making
of
bricks
upon
an
adventure
with
others
by
which
he
presumed
to
have
got
a
great
deal
of
money
so
that
i
see
the
most
ingenious
men
may
sometimes
be
mistaken
in
the
park
where
i
met
wren
and
he
and
i
walked
together
in
the
it
being
most
summer
weather
that
ever
was
seen
and
here
talking
of
several
things
of
the
corruption
of
the
court
and
how
unfit
it
is
for
ingenuous
men
and
himself
particularly
to
live
in
it
where
a
man
can
not
live
but
he
must
spend
and
can
not
get
suitably
without
breach
of
his
honour
and
he
did
thereupon
tell
me
of
the
basest
thing
of
my
lord
barkeley
that
ever
was
heard
of
any
man
which
was
this
how
the
duke
of
york
commissioners
do
let
his
at
a
bad
rate
and
being
offered
a
better
they
did
persuade
the
duke
of
york
to
give
some
satisfaction
to
the
former
to
quit
it
and
let
it
to
the
latter
which
being
done
my
lord
barkeley
did
make
the
bargain
for
the
former
to
have
to
quit
it
whereof
since
it
is
come
to
light
that
they
were
to
have
but
and
himself
which
the
duke
of
york
hath
ever
since
for
some
years
paid
though
the
second
bargain
hath
been
broken
and
the
duke
of
york
lost
by
it
half
of
what
the
first
was
he
told
me
that
there
had
been
a
seeming
accommodation
between
the
duke
of
york
and
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
lord
arlington
the
two
latter
desiring
it
but
yet
that
there
is
not
true
agreement
between
them
but
they
do
labour
to
bring
in
all
new
creatures
into
play
and
the
duke
of
york
do
oppose
it
thence
he
gone
i
to
the
queene
chapel
and
there
heard
some
good
singing
and
so
to
white
hall
and
saw
the
king
and
queene
at
dinner
and
thence
with
sir
stephen
fox
to
dinner
and
the
cofferer
with
us
and
there
mighty
kind
usage
and
good
discourse
thence
spent
all
the
afternoon
walking
in
the
park
and
then
in
the
evening
at
court
on
the
queene
side
and
there
met
godolphin
who
tells
me
that
the
news
is
true
we
heard
yesterday
of
my
lord
being
come
to
in
cornwall
this
night
in
the
queene
my
lord
brouncker
told
me
the
difference
that
is
now
between
the
three
embassadors
here
the
venetian
french
and
spaniard
the
third
not
being
willing
to
make
a
visit
to
the
first
because
he
would
not
receive
him
at
the
door
who
is
willing
to
give
him
as
much
respect
as
he
did
to
the
french
who
was
used
no
otherwise
and
who
refuses
now
to
take
more
of
him
upon
being
desired
thereto
in
order
to
the
making
an
accommodation
in
this
matter
knipp
maid
comes
to
me
to
tell
me
that
the
women
day
at
the
playhouse
is
and
that
therefore
i
must
be
there
to
encrease
their
profit
by
water
to
james
and
there
had
good
opportunity
of
speaking
with
the
duke
of
york
who
desires
me
again
talking
on
that
matter
to
prepare
something
for
him
to
do
for
the
better
managing
of
our
office
telling
me
that
my
lord
keeper
and
he
talking
about
it
yesterday
my
lord
keeper
did
advise
him
to
do
so
it
being
better
to
come
from
him
than
otherwise
which
i
have
promised
to
do
thence
to
my
lord
burlington
house
the
first
time
i
ever
was
there
it
being
the
house
built
by
sir
john
denham
next
to
and
here
i
visited
my
lord
hinchingbroke
and
his
lady
sidney
montagu
being
last
night
come
to
town
unexpectedly
from
where
he
left
my
lord
well
eight
days
since
so
as
we
now
hourly
expect
to
hear
of
his
arrivall
at
portsmouth
sidney
is
mighty
grown
and
i
am
glad
i
am
here
to
see
him
at
his
first
coming
though
it
cost
me
dear
for
here
i
come
to
be
necessitated
to
supply
them
with
for
my
lord
vide
pepys
letter
to
lord
sandwich
on
this
subject
in
the
appendix
he
sent
him
up
with
a
declaration
to
his
friends
of
the
necessity
of
his
being
presently
supplied
with
but
i
do
not
think
he
will
get
however
i
think
it
becomes
my
duty
to
my
lord
to
do
something
extraordinary
in
this
and
the
rather
because
i
have
been
remiss
in
writing
to
him
during
this
voyage
more
than
ever
i
did
in
my
life
and
more
indeed
than
was
fit
for
me
by
and
by
comes
sir
godolphin
to
see
sidney
who
i
perceive
is
much
dissatisfied
that
he
should
come
to
town
last
night
and
not
yet
be
with
my
lord
arlington
who
and
all
the
town
hear
of
his
being
come
and
he
did
it
seems
take
notice
of
it
to
godolphin
this
morning
so
that
i
perceive
this
remissness
in
affairs
do
continue
in
my
lord
managements
still
which
i
am
sorry
for
but
above
all
to
see
in
what
a
condition
my
lord
is
for
money
that
i
dare
swear
he
do
not
know
where
to
take
up
of
any
man
in
england
at
this
time
upon
his
word
but
or
myself
as
i
believe
by
the
sequel
hereof
it
will
appear
here
i
first
saw
and
saluted
my
lady
burlington
elizabeth
sole
daughter
and
heir
to
henry
earl
of
cumberland
wife
of
richard
first
earl
of
burlington
a
very
lady
and
a
good
woman
but
old
and
not
handsome
but
a
brave
woman
here
i
also
standing
by
a
candle
that
was
brought
for
sealing
a
letter
do
set
my
periwigg
which
made
such
an
odd
noise
nobody
could
tell
what
it
was
till
they
saw
the
flame
my
back
being
to
the
candle
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
city
match
a
comedy
by
jasper
mayne
not
acted
these
thirty
years
and
but
a
silly
play
the
king
and
court
there
the
house
for
the
women
sake
mighty
full
so
i
to
white
hall
and
there
all
the
evening
on
the
queene
side
and
it
being
a
most
day
and
a
fine
warm
evening
the
italians
came
in
a
barge
under
the
leads
before
the
queene
and
so
the
queene
and
ladies
went
out
and
heard
them
for
almost
an
hour
and
the
singing
was
indeed
very
good
together
but
yet
there
was
but
one
voice
that
alone
did
appear
considerable
and
that
was
signior
joanni
this
done
by
and
by
they
went
in
and
here
i
saw
sidney
montagu
kiss
the
queene
hand
who
was
mighty
kind
to
him
and
the
ladies
looked
mightily
on
him
and
the
king
came
by
and
by
and
did
talk
to
him
so
i
away
by
coach
with
alderman
backewell
home
who
is
mighty
kind
to
me
more
than
ordinary
in
his
expressions
but
i
do
hear
this
day
what
troubles
me
that
sir
coventry
is
quite
out
of
play
the
king
seldom
speaking
to
him
and
that
there
is
a
design
of
making
a
lord
treasurer
and
that
my
lord
arlington
shall
be
the
man
but
i
can
not
believe
it
but
yet
the
duke
of
buckingham
hath
it
in
his
mind
and
those
with
him
to
make
a
thorough
alteration
in
things
and
among
the
rest
coventry
to
be
out
a
hiatus
occurs
in
the
diary
at
this
period
for
thirteen
days
during
which
pepys
went
into
the
country
as
he
subsequently
alludes
to
his
having
been
at
saxham
whilst
the
king
was
there
he
had
probably
been
to
impington
to
fetch
his
wife
and
perhaps
omitted
copying
his
rough
notes
into
the
blank
pages
evidently
left
for
them
in
the
journal
october
to
white
hall
to
enquire
when
the
duke
of
york
will
be
in
town
in
order
to
turner
going
down
to
audley
end
about
his
place
and
here
i
met
in
james
park
with
one
that
told
me
that
the
duke
of
york
would
be
in
town
home
where
i
find
sir
cholmly
come
to
town
and
is
come
hither
to
see
me
and
he
is
a
man
that
i
love
mightily
as
being
of
a
gentleman
the
most
industrious
that
ever
i
saw
he
staid
with
me
awhile
talking
and
telling
me
his
obligations
to
my
lord
sandwich
which
i
was
glad
of
and
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
now
chief
of
all
men
in
this
kingdom
which
i
knew
before
and
that
he
do
think
the
parliament
will
hardly
ever
meet
again
which
is
a
great
many
men
thoughts
and
i
shall
not
be
sorry
for
it
read
a
ridiculous
nonsensical
book
set
out
by
will
pen
for
the
quakers
but
so
full
of
nothing
but
nonsense
that
i
was
ashamed
to
read
in
it
with
my
lord
brouncker
and
did
get
his
ready
assent
to
hater
having
of
turner
place
and
so
sir
also
but
when
we
come
to
sit
down
at
the
board
comes
to
us
wren
this
day
to
town
and
tells
me
that
james
southern
do
petition
the
duke
of
york
for
the
place
of
deptford
which
did
trouble
me
much
and
also
the
board
though
upon
discourse
after
he
was
gone
we
did
resolve
to
move
hard
for
our
clerks
and
that
places
of
preferment
may
go
according
to
seniority
and
merit
at
my
lord
middleton
and
i
did
this
day
find
by
discourse
with
somebody
that
this
gentleman
was
the
great
middleton
that
was
of
the
scots
army
in
the
beginning
of
the
late
war
against
the
king
to
white
hall
and
there
walked
to
james
where
i
find
the
court
mighty
full
it
being
the
duke
of
york
birthday
and
he
mighty
fine
and
all
the
musick
one
after
another
to
my
great
content
here
i
met
with
sir
cholmly
and
he
and
i
to
walk
and
to
my
lord
barkeley
new
house
there
to
see
a
new
experiment
of
a
cart
which
by
having
two
little
wheeles
fastened
to
the
is
said
to
make
it
go
with
half
the
ease
and
more
than
another
cart
but
we
did
not
see
the
trial
made
to
the
king
playhouse
and
saw
the
faithful
shepherdess
a
dramatic
pastoral
by
j
fletcher
that
i
might
hear
the
french
eunuch
sing
which
i
did
to
my
great
content
though
i
do
admire
his
action
as
much
as
his
singing
being
both
beyond
all
i
ever
saw
or
heard
this
day
at
the
board
came
unexpected
the
warrants
from
the
duke
of
york
for
turner
and
hater
for
the
places
they
desire
which
contents
me
mightily
moore
and
seamour
were
with
me
this
afternoon
who
tell
me
that
my
lord
sandwich
was
received
mighty
kindly
by
the
king
and
is
in
exceeding
great
esteem
with
him
and
the
rest
about
him
but
i
doubt
it
will
be
hard
for
him
to
please
both
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
which
i
shall
be
sorry
for
moore
tells
me
the
sad
condition
my
lord
is
in
in
his
estate
and
debts
and
the
way
he
now
lives
in
so
high
and
so
many
vain
servants
about
him
that
he
must
be
ruined
if
he
do
not
take
up
which
by
the
grace
of
god
i
will
put
him
upon
when
i
come
to
see
him
with
lord
brouncker
to
lincolne
inn
and
ball
to
visit
wilkins
now
newly
bishop
of
chester
and
he
received
us
mighty
kindly
and
had
most
excellent
discourse
from
him
about
his
book
of
reall
character
and
so
i
with
lord
brouncker
to
white
hall
and
there
saw
the
queene
and
some
ladies
to
the
duke
of
york
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
first
time
acted
the
queene
of
aragon
a
by
william
habington
upon
its
revival
the
prologue
and
epilogue
were
written
by
butler
the
author
of
hudibras
an
old
play
but
an
admirable
one
so
good
that
i
am
astonished
at
it
and
wonder
where
it
hath
lain
asleep
all
this
while
that
i
have
never
heard
of
it
before
at
this
time
my
wife
and
i
mighty
busy
laying
out
money
in
dressing
up
our
best
chamber
and
thinking
of
a
coach
and
coachman
and
horses
and
the
more
because
of
creed
being
now
married
to
pickering
elizabeth
daughter
of
sir
gilbert
pickering
became
the
wife
of
john
creed
of
oundle
and
had
issue
by
him
major
richard
creed
killed
at
the
battle
of
blenheim
a
thing
i
could
never
have
expected
but
it
is
done
about
seven
or
ten
days
since
i
walked
out
to
look
for
a
coach
and
saw
many
and
did
light
on
one
for
which
i
bid
which
do
please
me
mightily
dining
with
batelier
i
rose
from
table
before
the
rest
because
under
an
obligation
to
go
to
my
lord
brouncker
where
to
meet
several
gentlemen
of
the
royal
society
to
go
and
make
a
visit
to
the
french
embassador
colbert
at
he
having
endeavoured
to
make
one
or
two
to
my
lord
brouncker
as
our
president
but
he
was
not
within
but
i
came
too
late
to
my
lord
sandwich
lodgings
who
came
to
town
the
last
night
and
is
come
thither
to
lie
and
met
with
him
within
and
among
others
my
new
cosen
creed
who
looks
mighty
soberly
and
he
and
i
saluted
one
another
with
mighty
gravity
till
we
came
to
a
little
more
freedom
of
talk
about
it
but
here
i
hear
that
sir
gilbert
pickering
is
lately
dead
about
three
days
since
which
makes
some
sorrow
there
though
not
much
because
of
his
being
long
expected
to
die
having
been
in
a
lethargy
long
so
waited
on
my
lord
to
court
and
there
staid
and
saw
the
ladies
awhile
and
thence
to
my
wife
and
took
them
up
and
so
home
and
to
supper
and
bed
to
my
lord
sandwich
where
i
find
my
lord
within
but
busy
private
and
so
i
staid
a
little
talking
with
the
young
gentlemen
and
so
away
with
pierce
the
surgeon
towards
tyburne
to
see
the
people
executed
but
came
too
late
it
being
done
two
men
and
a
woman
hanged
pierce
do
tell
me
among
other
news
the
late
frolick
and
debauchery
of
sir
charles
sedley
and
buckhurst
running
up
and
down
all
the
night
almost
naked
through
the
streets
and
at
last
fighting
and
being
beat
by
the
watch
and
clapped
up
all
night
and
how
the
king
takes
their
parts
and
my
lord
chief
justice
keeling
hath
laid
the
constable
by
the
heels
to
answer
it
next
sessions
which
is
a
horrid
shame
how
the
king
and
these
gentlemen
did
make
the
fiddlers
of
thetford
this
last
progress
to
sing
them
all
the
obscene
songs
they
could
think
of
how
sir
coventry
was
brought
the
other
day
to
the
duchesse
of
york
by
the
duke
of
york
to
kiss
her
hand
who
did
acknowledge
his
unhappiness
to
occasion
her
so
much
sorrow
declaring
his
intentions
in
it
and
praying
her
pardon
which
she
did
give
him
upon
his
promise
to
make
good
his
pretences
of
innocence
to
her
family
by
his
faithfulness
to
his
master
the
duke
of
york
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
now
all
in
all
and
will
ruin
coventry
if
he
can
and
that
coventry
do
now
rest
wholly
upon
the
duke
of
york
for
his
standing
which
is
a
great
turn
he
tells
me
that
my
lady
castlemaine
however
is
a
mortal
enemy
to
the
duke
of
buckingham
which
i
understand
not
but
it
seems
she
is
disgusted
with
his
greatness
and
his
ill
usage
of
her
that
the
king
was
drunk
at
saxam
saxham
near
newmarket
in
suffolk
a
seat
of
william
baron
crofts
long
since
pulled
down
with
sedley
buckhurst
the
night
that
my
lord
arlington
came
thither
and
would
not
give
him
audience
or
could
not
which
is
true
for
it
was
the
night
that
i
was
there
and
saw
the
king
go
up
to
his
chamber
and
was
told
that
the
king
had
been
drinking
he
tells
me
too
that
the
duke
of
york
did
the
next
day
chide
bab
may
for
his
occasioning
the
king
giving
himself
up
to
these
gentlemen
to
the
neglecting
of
my
lord
arlington
to
which
he
answered
merrily
that
there
was
no
man
in
england
that
had
a
head
to
lose
durst
do
what
they
do
every
day
with
the
king
and
asked
the
duke
of
york
pardon
which
is
a
sign
of
a
mad
world
god
bless
us
out
of
it
this
morning
comes
to
me
the
coachmaker
and
agreed
with
me
for
and
to
stand
to
the
courtesy
of
what
more
i
should
give
him
upon
the
finishing
of
it
he
is
likely
also
to
fit
me
with
a
coachman
i
was
obliged
to
attend
the
duke
of
york
thinking
to
have
had
a
meeting
of
tangier
but
had
not
but
he
did
take
me
and
wren
into
his
closet
and
there
did
press
me
to
prepare
what
i
had
to
say
upon
the
answers
of
my
to
his
great
letter
which
i
promised
to
do
against
his
coming
to
town
again
the
next
week
and
so
to
other
discourse
finding
plainly
that
he
is
in
trouble
and
apprehensions
of
the
reformers
and
would
be
found
to
do
what
he
can
towards
reforming
himself
and
so
thence
to
my
lord
sandwich
where
after
long
stay
he
being
in
talk
with
others
privately
i
to
him
and
there
he
taking
physic
and
keeping
his
chamber
i
had
an
hour
talk
with
him
about
the
ill
posture
of
things
at
this
time
while
the
king
gives
countenance
to
sir
charles
sedley
and
lord
buckhurst
he
tells
me
that
he
thinks
his
matters
do
stand
well
with
the
king
and
hopes
to
have
dispatch
to
his
mind
but
i
doubt
it
and
do
see
that
he
do
fear
it
too
he
told
me
of
my
lady
trouble
about
my
writing
of
that
letter
of
the
duke
of
lately
to
the
office
which
i
did
not
own
but
declared
to
be
of
no
injury
to
carteret
and
that
i
would
write
a
letter
to
him
to
satisfy
him
therein
but
this
i
am
in
pain
how
to
do
without
doing
myself
wrong
and
the
end
i
had
of
preparing
a
justification
to
myself
hereafter
when
the
faults
of
the
navy
come
to
be
found
out
however
i
will
do
it
in
the
best
manner
i
can
wren
first
tells
us
of
the
order
from
the
king
come
last
night
to
the
duke
of
york
for
signifying
his
pleasure
to
the
for
drawing
up
a
commission
for
suspending
of
my
lord
anglesy
and
putting
in
sir

littleton
and
sir

eldest
son
of
sir

osborne
bart
made
a

the
following

constituted
lord

and
elected
in
he
was
created

and
viscount
latimer
earl
of
danby
marquis
of
caermarthen
and
duke
of
leeds
ob
the
former
a
creature
of
arlington
and
the
latter
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
during
the
suspension
the
duke
of
york
was
forced
to
obey
and
did
grant
it
he
being
to
go
to
newmarket
this
day
with
the
king
and
so
the
king
pressed
for
it
but
wren
do
own
that
the
duke
of
york
is
the
most
wounded
in
this
in
the
world
for
it
is
done
and
concluded
without
his
privity
after
his
appearing
for
him
and
that
it
is
plain
that
they
do
ayme
to
bring
the
admiralty
into
commission
too
and
lessen
the
duke
of
york
this
do
put
strange
apprehensions
into
all
our
board
only
i
think
i
am
the
least
troubled
at
it
for
i
care
not
at
all
for
it
but
my
lord
brouncker
and
pen
do
seem
to
think
much
of
it
up
betimes
and
povy
comes
to
even
accounts
with
me
which
we
did
and
then
fell
to
other
talk
he
tells
me
in
short
how
the
king
is
made
a
child
of
by
buckingham
and
arlington
to
the
lessening
of
the
duke
of
york
whom
they
can
not
suffer
to
be
great
for
fear
of
my
lord
chancellor
return
which
therefore
they
make
the
king
violent
against
that
he
believes
it
is
impossible
these
two
great
men
can
hold
together
long
or
at
least
that
the
ambition
of
the
former
is
so
great
that
he
will
endeavour
to
master
all
and
bring
into
play
as
many
as
he
can
that
anglesy
will
not
lose
his
place
easily
but
will
contend
in
law
with
whoever
comes
to
execute
it
that
the
duke
of
york
in
all
things
but
in
his
amours
is
led
by
the
nose
by
his
wife
that
sir
coventry
is
now
by
the
duke
of
york
made
friends
with
the
duchesse
and
that
he
is
often
there
and
waits
on
her
that
he
do
believe
that
these
present
great
men
will
break
in
time
and
that
sir
coventry
will
be
a
great
man
again
for
he
do
labour
to
have
nothing
to
do
in
matters
of
the
state
and
is
so
usefull
to
the
side
that
he
is
on
that
he
will
stand
though
at
present
he
is
quite
out
of
play
that
my
lady
castlemaine
hates
the
duke
of
buckingham
that
the
duke
of
york
hath
expressed
himself
very
kind
to
my
lord
sandwich
which
i
am
mighty
glad
of
that
we
are
to
expect
more
changes
if
these
men
stand
this
day
my
lord
anglesy
was
at
the
office
and
do
seem
to
make
nothing
of
this
business
of
his
suspension
resolving
to
bring
it
into
council
where
he
seems
not
to
doubt
to
have
right
he
standing
upon
his
defence
and
patent
and
hath
put
in
his
caveats
to
the
several
offices
so
as
soon
as
the
king
comes
back
again
which
will
be
on
tuesday
next
he
will
bring
it
into
the
council
november
to
povy
and
there
i
find
my
lords
sandwich
peterborough
and
hinchingbroke
charles
harbord
and
sidney
montagu
and
there
i
was
stopped
and
dined
mighty
nobly
at
a
good
table
with
one
little
dish
at
a
time
upon
it
but
mighty
merry
i
was
glad
to
see
it
but
sorry
methought
to
see
my
lord
have
so
little
reason
to
be
merry
and
yet
glad
for
his
sake
to
have
him
cheerful
after
dinner
up
and
looked
up
and
down
the
house
and
so
to
the
cellar
and
thence
i
slipt
away
without
taking
leave
to
white
hall
and
there
i
find
the
king
and
duke
of
york
came
the
last
night
and
every
body
mouth
full
of
my
lord
anglesy
suspension
being
sealed
which
it
was
it
seems
yesterday
so
that
he
is
prevented
in
his
remedy
at
the
council
and
it
seems
the
two
new
treasurers
did
kiss
the
king
hand
this
morning
brought
in
by
my
lord
arlington
they
walked
up
and
down
together
in
the
court
this
day
and
several
people
joyed
them
but
i
avoided
it
that
i
might
not
be
seen
to
look
either
way
this
day
also
i
hear
that
my
lord
ormond
is
to
be
declared
in
council
no
more
deputy
governor
of
ireland
his
commission
being
expired
and
the
king
is
prevailed
with
to
take
it
out
of
his
hands
which
people
do
mightily
admire
saying
that
he
is
the
greatest
subject
of
any
prince
in
christendome
and
hath
more
acres
of
land
than
any
and
hath
done
more
for
his
prince
than
ever
any
yet
did
but
all
will
not
do
he
must
down
it
seems
the
duke
of
buckingham
carrying
all
before
him
but
that
that
troubles
me
most
is
that
they
begin
to
talk
that
the
duke
of
york
regiment
is
ordered
to
be
disbanded
and
more
that
undoubtedly
his
admiralty
will
follow
which
do
shake
me
mightily
and
i
fear
will
have
ill
consequences
in
the
nation
for
these
counsels
are
very
mad
the
duke
of
york
do
by
all
men
report
carry
himself
wonderfull
submissive
to
the
king
in
the
most
humble
manner
in
the
world
but
yet
it
seems
nothing
must
be
spared
that
tends
to
the
keeping
out
the
chancellor
and
that
is
the
reason
of
all
this
the
great
discourse
now
is
that
the
parliament
shall
be
dissolved
and
another
called
which
shall
give
the
king
the
dean
and
chapter
lands
and
that
will
put
him
out
of
debt
and
it
is
said
that
buckingham
do
knowingly
meet
daily
with
wildman
and
other
and
that
when
he
is
with
them
he
makes
the
king
believe
that
he
is
with
his
wenches
and
something
looks
like
the
parliament
being
dissolved
by
harry
brouncker
being
now
come
back
and
appearing
this
day
the
first
day
at
white
hall
but
he
hath
not
been
yet
with
the
king
but
is
secure
that
he
shall
be
well
received
i
hear
god
bless
us
when
such
men
as
he
shall
be
restored
but
that
that
pleases
me
most
is
that
several
do
tell
me
that
pen
is
to
be
removed
and
others
that
he
hath
resigned
his
place
and
particularly
spragg
tells
me
for
certain
that
he
hath
resigned
it
and
is
become
a
partner
with
gauden
in
the
victualling
in
which
i
think
he
hath
done
a
very
cunning
thing
but
i
am
sure
i
am
glad
of
it
and
it
will
be
well
for
the
king
to
have
him
out
of
this
office
sir
john
talbot
talks
mighty
high
for
my
lord
of
ormond
and
i
perceive
this
family
of
the
talbots
hath
been
raised
by
my
lord
the
duke
of
york
did
call
me
and
wren
and
my
paper
that
i
have
lately
taken
pains
to
draw
up
was
read
and
the
duke
of
york
pleased
therewith
and
we
did
all
along
conclude
upon
answers
to
my
mind
for
the
board
and
that
that
if
put
in
execution
will
do
the
king
business
but
i
do
now
more
and
more
perceive
the
duke
of
york
trouble
and
that
he
do
lie
under
great
weight
of
mind
from
the
duke
of
buckingham
carrying
things
against
him
and
particularly
when
i
advised
that
he
would
use
his
interest
that
a
seaman
might
come
into
the
room
of
sir
pen
who
is
now
declared
to
be
gone
from
us
to
that
of
the
victualling
and
did
show
how
the
office
would
now
be
left
without
one
seaman
in
it
but
the
surveyor
and
the
controller
who
is
so
old
as
to
be
able
to
do
nothing
he
told
me
plainly
that
i
knew
his
mind
well
enough
as
to
seamen
but
that
it
must
be
as
others
will
and
wren
did
tell
it
me
as
a
secret
that
when
the
duke
of
york
did
first
tell
the
king
about
sir
pen
leaving
of
the
place
and
that
when
the
duke
of
york
did
move
the
king
that
either
captain
cox
or
sir
jer
smith
might
succeed
him
the
king
did
tell
him
that
that
was
a
matter
fit
to
be
considered
of
and
would
not
agree
to
either
presently
and
so
the
duke
of
york
could
not
prevail
for
either
nor
knows
who
it
shall
be
the
duke
of
york
did
tell
me
himself
that
if
he
had
not
carried
it
privately
when
first
he
mentioned
pen
leaving
his
place
to
the
king
it
had
not
been
done
for
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
those
of
his
party
do
cry
out
upon
it
as
a
strange
thing
to
trust
such
a
thing
into
the
hands
of
one
that
stands
accused
in
parliament
and
that
they
have
so
far
prevailed
upon
the
king
that
he
would
not
have
him
named
in
council
but
only
take
his
name
to
the
board
but
i
think
he
said
that
only
gauden
name
shall
go
in
the
patent
at
least
at
the
time
when
sir
richard
browne
asked
the
king
the
names
of
security
the
king
told
him
it
was
not
yet
necessary
for
him
to
declare
them
and
by
and
by
when
the
duke
of
york
and
we
had
done
wren
brought
into
the
closet
captain
cox
and
james
temple
about
business
of
the
guinea
company
and
talking
something
of
the
duke
of
concernment
therein
says
the
duke
of
york
i
shall
give
the
devil
his
due
as
they
say
the
duke
of
buckingham
hath
paid
in
his
money
to
the
company
or
something
of
that
kind
wherein
he
would
do
right
to
him
the
duke
of
york
told
me
how
these
people
do
begin
to
cast
dirt
upon
the
business
that
passed
the
council
lately
touching
supernumeraries
as
passed
by
virtue
of
his
authority
there
there
being
not
liberty
for
any
man
to
withstand
what
the
duke
of
york
advises
there
which
he
told
me
they
bring
only
as
an
argument
to
insinuate
the
putting
of
the
admiralty
into
commission
which
by
all
men
discourse
is
now
designed
and
i
perceive
the
same
by
him
this
being
done
and
going
from
him
i
up
and
down
the
house
to
hear
news
and
there
every
body
mouth
full
of
changes
and
among
others
the
duke
of
york
regiment
of
guards
that
was
raised
during
the
late
war
at
sea
it
is
to
be
disbanded
and
also
that
this
day
the
king
do
intend
to
declare
that
the
duke
of
ormond
is
no
more
deputy
of
ireland
but
that
he
will
put
it
into
commission
this
day
our
new
treasurers
did
kiss
the
king
hand
who
complimented
them
as
they
say
very
highly
that
he
had
for
a
long
time
been
abused
in
his
treasury
and
that
he
was
now
safe
in
their
hands
i
saw
them
walk
up
and
down
the
court
together
all
this
morning
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
osborne
who
is
a
comely
gentleman
this
day
i
was
told
that
my
lord
anglesy
did
deliver
a
petition
on
wednesday
in
council
to
the
king
laying
open
that
whereas
he
had
heard
that
his
majesty
had
made
such
a
disposal
of
his
place
which
he
had
formerly
granted
him
for
life
upon
a
valuable
consideration
and
that
without
any
thing
laid
to
his
charge
and
during
a
parliament
sessions
he
prayed
that
his
majesty
would
be
pleased
to
let
his
case
be
heard
before
the
council
and
the
judges
of
the
land
who
were
his
proper
counsel
in
all
matters
of
right
to
which
i
am
told
the
king
after
my
lord
being
withdrawn
concluded
upon
his
giving
him
an
answer
some
few
days
hence
and
so
he
was
called
in
and
told
so
at
the
treasurer
sir
thomas
clifford
where
i
did
eat
some
oysters
which
while
we
were
at
in
comes
my
lord
keeper
and
much
company
and
so
i
thought
it
best
to
withdraw
and
so
away
and
to
the
swedes
agent
and
there
met
povy
where
the
agent
would
have
me
stay
and
dine
there
being
only
them
and
joseph
williamson
and
sir
thomas
clayton
thomas
clayton
professor
of
physic
and
anatomy
lecturer
at
oxford
for
which
university
he
was
chosen
member
and
afterwards
knighted
and
made
warden
of
merton
college
but
what
he
is
i
know
not
here
much
extraordinary
noble
discourse
of
foreign
princes
and
particularly
the
greatness
of
the
king
of
france
and
of
his
being
fallen
into
the
right
way
of
making
the
kingdom
great
i
was
mightily
pleased
with
this
company
and
their
discourse
to
see
roger
pepys
at
his
lodgings
next
door
to
house
a
barber
and
there
i
did
see
a
book
which
my
lord
sandwich
hath
promised
one
to
me
of
a
description
of
the
escuriall
in
spain
which
i
have
a
great
desire
to
have
though
i
took
it
for
a
finer
book
when
he
promised
it
me
the
duke
of
york
told
me
that
sir
pen
had
been
with
him
this
morning
to
ask
whether
it
would
be
fit
for
him
to
sit
at
the
office
now
because
of
his
resolution
to
be
gone
and
to
become
concerned
in
the
victualling
the
duke
of
york
answered
yes
till
his
contract
was
signed
thence
i
to
lord
sandwich
and
there
to
see
him
but
was
made
to
stay
very
long
as
his
best
friends
are
and
when
i
came
to
him
had
little
pleasure
his
head
being
full
of
his
own
business
i
think
thence
to
white
hall
with
him
to
a
committee
of
tangier
a
day
appointed
for
him
to
give
an
account
of
tangier
and
what
he
did
and
found
there
which
though
he
had
admirable
matter
for
it
and
his
doings
there
were
good
and
would
have
afforded
a
noble
account
yet
he
did
it
with
a
mind
so
low
and
mean
and
delivered
in
so
poor
a
manner
that
it
appeared
nothing
at
all
nor
any
body
seemed
to
value
it
whereas
he
might
have
shown
himself
to
have
merited
extraordinary
thanks
and
been
held
to
have
done
a
very
great
service
whereas
now
all
that
cost
the
king
hath
been
at
for
his
journey
through
spain
thither
seems
to
be
almost
lost
after
we
were
up
creed
and
i
walked
together
and
did
talk
a
good
while
of
the
weak
report
my
lord
made
and
were
troubled
for
it
i
fearing
that
either
his
mind
and
judgment
are
depressed
or
that
he
do
it
out
of
his
great
neglect
and
so
that
he
do
all
the
rest
of
his
affairs
accordingly
to
the
office
where
by
a
speciall
desire
the
new
treasurers
came
and
there
did
show
their
patent
and
the
great
seal
for
the
suspension
of
my
lord
anglesy
and
here
did
sit
and
discourse
of
the
business
of
the
office
and
brought
hutchinson
with
them
who
i
hear
is
to
be
their
paymaster
in
the
room
of
waith
for
it
seems
they
do
turn
out
every
servant
that
belongs
to
the
present
treasurer
and
so
for
fenn
do
bring
in
littleton
sir
thomas
brother
and
oust
all
the
rest
but
hutchinson
do
already
see
that
his
work
now
will
be
another
kind
of
thing
than
before
as
to
the
trouble
of
it
up
and
with
sir
pen
by
coach
to
white
hall
where
to
the
duke
of
york
and
there
did
our
usual
business
and
thence
i
to
the
commissioners
of
the
treasury
where
i
staid
and
heard
an
excellent
case
argued
between
my
lord
gerard
and
the
town
of
newcastle
about
a
piece
of
ground
which
that
lord
hath
got
a
grant
of
under
the
exchequer
seal
which
they
were
endeavouring
to
get
of
the
king
under
the
great
seal
i
liked
mightily
the
counsel
for
the
town
shaftow
their
recorder
and
offly
but
i
was
troubled
and
so
were
the
lords
the
lords
commissioners
to
hear
my
lord
fly
out
against
their
the
inhabitants
of
newcastle
great
pretence
of
merit
from
the
king
for
their
sufferings
and
loyalty
telling
them
that
they
might
thank
him
for
that
repute
which
they
have
for
their
loyalty
for
that
it
was
he
that
forced
them
to
be
so
against
their
wills
when
he
was
there
and
moreover
did
offer
a
paper
to
the
lords
to
read
from
the
town
sent
in
but
the
lords
would
not
read
it
but
i
believe
it
was
something
about
bringing
the
king
to
trial
or
some
such
thing
in
that
year
thence
i
to
the
three
tuns
tavern
by
charing
cross
and
there
dined
with
pen
sir
minnes
and
commissioner
middleton
and
as
merry
as
my
mind
could
be
that
hath
so
much
trouble
upon
it
at
home
and
thence
to
white
hall
and
there
staid
in
wren
chamber
with
him
reading
over
my
draught
of
a
letter
which
gibson
then
attended
me
with
and
there
he
did
like
all
but
doubted
whether
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
duke
to
write
in
so
sharp
a
style
to
the
office
as
i
had
drawn
it
in
which
i
yield
to
him
to
consider
the
present
posture
of
the
times
and
the
duke
of
york
and
whether
it
were
not
better
to
err
on
that
hand
than
the
other
he
told
me
that
he
did
not
think
it
was
necessary
for
the
duke
of
york
to
do
and
that
it
would
not
suit
so
well
with
his
nature
nor
greatness
which
last
perhaps
is
true
but
then
do
too
truly
show
the
effects
of
having
princes
in
places
where
order
and
discipline
should
be
i
left
it
to
him
to
do
as
the
duke
of
york
pleases
and
so
fell
to
other
talk
and
with
great
freedom
of
public
things
and
he
told
me
upon
my
several
inquiries
to
that
purpose
that
he
did
believe
it
was
not
yet
resolved
whether
the
parliament
should
ever
meet
more
or
no
the
three
great
rulers
of
things
now
standing
thus
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
absolutely
against
their
meeting
as
moved
thereto
by
his
people
that
he
advises
with
the
people
of
the
late
times
who
do
never
expect
to
have
any
thing
done
by
this
parliament
for
their
religion
and
who
do
propose
that
by
the
sale
of
the
they
shall
be
able
to
put
the
king
out
of
debt
my
lord
keeper
is
utterly
against
putting
away
this
and
choosing
another
parliament
lest
they
prove
worse
than
this
and
will
make
all
the
king
friends
and
the
king
himself
in
a
desperate
condition
my
lord
arlington
knows
not
which
is
best
for
him
being
to
seek
whether
this
or
the
next
will
use
him
worst
he
tells
me
that
he
believes
that
it
is
intended
to
call
this
parliament
and
try
them
with
a
sum
of
money
and
if
they
do
not
like
it
then
to
send
them
going
and
call
another
who
will
at
the
ruin
of
the
church
perhaps
please
the
king
with
what
he
will
have
for
a
time
and
he
tells
me
therefore
that
he
do
believe
that
this
policy
will
be
endeavoured
by
the
church
and
their
friends
to
seem
to
promise
the
king
money
when
it
shall
be
propounded
but
make
the
king
and
these
great
men
buy
it
dear
before
they
have
it
he
tells
me
that
he
is
really
persuaded
that
the
design
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
by
bringing
the
state
into
such
a
condition
as
if
the
king
do
die
without
issue
it
shall
upon
his
death
break
into
pieces
again
and
so
put
by
the
duke
of
york
whom
they
have
disobliged
they
know
to
that
degree
as
to
despair
of
his
pardon
he
tells
me
that
there
is
no
way
to
rule
the
king
but
by
brisknesse
which
the
duke
of
buckingham
hath
above
all
men
and
that
the
duke
of
york
having
it
not
his
best
way
is
what
he
practices
that
is
to
say
a
good
temper
which
will
support
him
till
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
lord
arlington
fall
out
which
can
not
be
long
first
the
former
knowing
that
the
latter
did
in
the
time
of
the
chancellor
endeavour
with
the
chancellor
to
hang
him
at
that
time
when
he
was
proclaimed
against
and
here
by
the
by
he
told
me
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
did
by
his
friends
treat
with
my
lord
chancellor
by
the
mediation
of
matt
wren
and
clifford
to
fall
in
with
my
lord
chancellor
which
he
tells
me
he
did
advise
my
lord
chancellor
to
accept
of
as
that
that
with
his
own
interest
and
the
duke
of
york
would
undoubtedly
have
secured
all
to
him
and
his
family
but
that
my
lord
chancellor
was
a
man
not
to
be
advised
thinking
himself
too
high
to
be
counselled
and
so
all
is
come
to
nothing
for
by
that
means
the
duke
of
buckingham
became
desperate
and
was
forced
to
fall
in
with
arlington
to
his
ruin
this
morning
at
the
i
did
meet
jack
fenn
and
there
he
did
show
me
my
lord
anglesy
petition
and
the
answer
the
former
good
and
stout
as
i
before
did
hear
it
but
the
latter
short
and
weak
saying
that
he
was
not
by
what
the
king
had
done
hindered
from
taking
the
benefit
of
his
laws
and
that
the
reason
he
had
to
suspect
his
mismanagement
of
his
money
in
ireland
did
make
him
think
it
unfit
to
trust
him
with
his
treasury
in
england
till
he
was
satisfied
in
the
former
after
dinner
how
to
tell
me
what
hath
happened
between
him
and
the
commissioners
of
late
who
are
hot
again
more
than
ever
about
my
lord
sandwich
business
of
prizes
which
i
am
troubled
for
and
the
more
because
of
the
great
security
and
neglect
with
which
i
think
my
lord
do
look
upon
this
matter
that
may
yet
for
aught
i
know
undo
him
to
the
office
all
the
morning
where
the
new
treasurers
come
their
second
time
and
before
they
sat
down
did
discourse
with
the
board
and
particularly
my
lord
brouncker
about
their
place
which
they
challenge
as
having
been
heretofore
due
and
given
to
their
predecessor
which
at
last
my
lord
did
own
hath
been
given
him
only
out
of
courtesy
to
his
quality
and
that
he
did
not
take
it
as
of
right
at
the
board
so
they
for
the
present
sat
down
and
did
give
him
the
place
but
i
think
with
an
intent
to
have
the
duke
of
york
directions
about
it
this
evening
comes
billup
to
me
to
read
over
wren
alterations
of
my
draught
of
a
letter
for
the
duke
of
york
to
sign
to
the
board
which
i
like
mighty
well
they
being
not
considerable
only
in
mollifying
some
hard
terms
which
i
had
thought
fit
to
put
in
from
this
to
other
discourse
and
do
find
that
the
duke
of
york
and
his
master
wren
do
look
upon
this
service
of
mine
as
a
very
seasonable
service
to
the
duke
of
york
as
that
which
he
will
have
to
show
to
his
enemies
in
his
own
justification
of
his
care
of
the
king
business
and
i
am
sure
i
am
heartily
glad
of
it
both
for
the
king
sake
and
the
duke
of
york
and
my
own
also
for
if
i
continue
my
work
by
this
means
will
be
the
less
and
my
share
in
the
blame
also
this
day
my
boy
livery
is
come
home
the
first
i
ever
had
of
greene
lined
with
red
and
it
likes
me
well
enough
to
visit
my
lord
sandwich
who
is
now
so
reserved
or
moped
rather
i
think
with
his
own
business
that
he
bids
welcome
to
no
man
i
think
to
his
satisfaction
i
met
with
povy
who
tells
me
that
this
discourse
which
i
told
him
of
of
the
duke
of
monmouth
being
made
prince
of
wales
hath
nothing
in
it
though
he
thinks
there
are
all
the
endeavours
used
in
the
world
to
overthrow
the
duke
of
york
he
would
not
have
me
doubt
of
my
safety
in
the
navy
which
i
am
doubtful
of
from
the
reports
of
a
general
removal
but
he
will
endeavour
to
inform
me
what
he
can
gather
from
my
lord
arlington
that
he
do
think
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
hath
a
mind
rather
to
overthrow
all
the
kingdom
and
bring
in
a
commonwealth
wherein
he
may
think
to
be
general
of
their
army
or
to
make
himself
king
which
he
believes
he
may
be
led
to
by
some
advice
he
hath
had
with
conjurors
which
he
do
affect
wren
and
i
to
his
chamber
and
there
talked
and
he
seems
to
hope
that
these
people
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
arlington
will
run
themselves
off
of
their
legs
they
being
forced
to
be
always
putting
the
king
upon
one
idle
thing
or
other
against
the
easiness
of
his
nature
which
he
will
never
be
able
to
bear
nor
they
to
keep
him
to
and
so
will
lose
themselves
and
for
instance
of
their
little
progress
he
tells
me
that
my
lord
of
ormond
is
like
yet
to
carry
it
and
to
continue
in
his
command
in
ireland
at
least
they
can
not
get
the
better
of
him
yet
but
he
tells
me
that
the
keeper
is
wrought
upon
as
they
say
to
give
his
opinion
for
the
dissolving
of
the
parliament
which
he
thinks
will
undo
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
people
he
do
not
seem
to
own
the
hearing
or
fearing
of
any
thing
to
be
done
in
the
admiralty
to
the
lessening
of
the
duke
of
york
though
he
hears
how
the
is
full
of
it
troubled
at
hewer
losing
of
a
tally
of
which
i
sent
him
this
day
to
receive
of
the
commissioners
of
excise
comes
povey
by
appointment
to
dine
with
me
and
much
pleasant
discourse
with
him
and
some
serious
and
he
tells
me
that
he
would
by
all
means
have
me
get
to
be
a
the
next
parliament
by
and
by
comes
my
cosen
roger
and
dines
with
us
and
after
dinner
did
seal
his
mortgage
wherein
i
do
wholly
rely
on
his
honesty
not
having
so
much
as
read
over
what
he
hath
given
me
for
it
nor
minded
it
but
do
trust
to
his
integrity
therein
this
day
presented
to
the
board
the
duke
of
york
letter
which
i
perceive
troubled
sir
pen
he
declaring
himself
meant
in
that
part
that
concerned
excuse
by
sickness
but
i
do
not
care
but
am
mightily
glad
that
it
is
done
and
now
i
shall
begin
to
be
at
pretty
good
ease
in
the
office
this
morning
to
my
great
content
hewer
tells
me
that
a
porter
is
come
who
found
my
tally
in
holborn
and
brings
it
him
for
which
he
gives
him
my
wife
lately
frighted
me
about
her
being
a
catholique
and
i
dare
not
therefore
move
her
to
go
to
church
for
fear
she
should
deny
me
but
this
morning
of
her
own
accord
she
spoke
of
going
to
church
the
next
sunday
which
pleases
me
mightily
my
wife
after
dinner
went
the
first
time
abroad
in
her
coach
calling
on
roger
pepys
and
visiting
creed
and
my
cosen
turner
thus
ended
this
month
with
very
good
content
but
most
expenseful
to
my
purse
on
things
of
pleasure
having
furnished
my
wife
closet
and
the
best
chamber
and
a
coach
and
horses
that
ever
i
knew
in
the
world
and
i
am
put
into
the
greatest
condition
of
outward
state
that
ever
i
was
in
or
hoped
ever
to
be
or
desired
and
this
at
a
time
when
we
do
daily
expect
great
changes
in
this
office
and
by
all
reports
we
must
all
of
us
turn
out
but
my
eyes
are
come
to
that
condition
that
i
am
not
able
to
work
and
therefore
that
and
my
wife
desire
make
me
have
no
manner
of
trouble
in
my
thoughts
about
it
so
god
do
his
will
in
it
december
abroad
with
my
wife
the
first
time
that
ever
i
rode
in
my
own
coach
which
do
make
my
heart
rejoice
and
praise
god
and
pray
him
to
bless
it
to
me
and
continue
it
so
she
and
i
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
usurper
a
tragedy
by
edward
howard
a
pretty
good
play
in
all
but
what
is
designed
to
resemble
cromwell
and
hugh
peters
which
is
mighty
silly
the
play
done
we
to
white
hall
where
my
wife
staid
while
i
up
to
the
duchesse
and
queene
side
to
speak
with
the
duke
of
york
and
here
saw
all
the
ladies
and
heard
the
silly
discourse
of
the
king
with
his
people
about
him
telling
a
story
of
my
lord
rochester
having
of
his
clothes
stole
while
he
was
with
a
wench
and
his
gold
all
gone
but
his
clothes
found
afterwards
stuffed
into
a
by
the
wench
that
stole
them
i
spoke
with
the
duke
of
york
just
as
he
was
set
down
to
supper
with
the
king
about
our
sending
of
victuals
to
sir
thomas
allen
fleet
hence
to
cales
to
meet
him
sir
jer
smith
with
me
who
is
a
silly
prating
talking
man
but
he
tells
me
what
he
hears
that
holmes
and
spragg
now
rule
all
with
the
duke
of
buckingham
as
to
and
will
be
great
men
but
he
do
prophecy
what
will
be
the
fruit
of
it
so
i
do
so
to
the
office
where
we
sat
all
the
morning
and
at
noon
home
to
dinner
and
then
abroad
again
with
my
wife
to
the
duke
of
york
playhouse
and
saw
the
unfortunate
lovers
a
tragedy
by
sir
wm
davenant
a
mean
play
i
think
but
some
parts
very
good
and
excellently
acted
we
sat
under
the
boxes
and
saw
the
fine
ladies
among
others
my
lady
kerneguy
who
is
most
devilishly
painted
and
so
home
it
being
mighty
pleasure
to
go
alone
with
my
poor
wife
in
a
coach
of
our
own
to
a
play
and
makes
us
appear
mighty
great
i
think
in
the
world
at
least
greater
than
ever
i
could
or
my
friends
for
me
have
once
expected
or
i
think
than
ever
any
of
my
family
ever
yet
lived
in
my
memory
but
my
cosen
pepys
in
salisbury
court
did
wait
as
usual
upon
the
duke
of
york
where
upon
discoursing
something
touching
the
which
by
letter
the
board
did
give
the
duke
of
york
their
advice
to
be
put
upon
lord
brouncker
sir
minnes
did
foolishly
rise
up
and
complain
of
the
office
and
his
being
made
nothing
of
and
this
before
sir
thomas
littleton
who
would
be
glad
of
this
difference
among
us
which
did
trouble
me
mightily
and
therefore
i
did
forbear
to
say
what
i
otherwise
would
have
thought
fit
for
me
to
say
on
this
occasion
upon
so
impertinent
a
speech
as
this
doating
fool
made
but
i
say
i
let
it
alone
and
contented
myself
that
it
went
as
i
advised
as
to
the
duke
of
york
judgment
in
the
thing
dispated
pickering
who
meets
me
at
smithfield
and
i
and
hewer
and
a
friend
a
jockey
of
his
did
go
about
to
see
several
pairs
of
horses
for
my
coach
but
it
was
late
and
we
agreed
on
none
but
left
it
to
another
time
but
here
i
do
see
instances
of
a
piece
of
craft
and
cunning
that
i
never
dreamed
of
concerning
the
buying
and
choosing
of
horses
to
the
office
where
vexed
to
see
how
ill
all
the
controller
business
is
likely
to
go
as
long
as
ever
sir
minnes
lives
and
so
troubled
i
was
that
i
thought
it
a
good
occasion
for
me
to
give
my
thoughts
of
it
in
writing
and
there
fore
wrote
a
letter
at
the
board
by
the
help
of
a
tube
to
lord
brouncker
and
did
give
it
him
which
i
kept
a
copy
of
and
it
may
be
of
use
to
me
hereafter
to
show
in
this
matter
this
being
done
i
home
to
my
aunt
who
supped
with
us
and
my
uncle
also
and
a
woman
she
is
so
that
i
think
we
shall
keep
her
acquaintance
but
mighty
proud
she
is
of
her
being
lately
set
with
diamonds
cost
her
about
and
i
did
commend
it
mightily
to
her
but
do
not
think
it
very
suitable
for
one
of
our
quality
no
news
stirring
but
that
my
lord
of
ormond
is
likely
to
go
to
ireland
again
which
do
show
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
do
not
rule
all
so
absolutely
and
that
however
we
shall
speedily
have
more
changes
in
the
navy
and
it
is
certain
that
the
nonconformists
do
now
preach
openly
in
houses
in
many
places
and
among
others
the
house
that
was
heretofore
sir
carteret
in
and
have
ready
access
to
the
king
and
now
the
great
dispute
is
whether
this
parliament
or
another
and
my
great
design
if
i
continue
in
the
navy
is
to
get
myself
to
be
a
lord
day
up
and
with
my
wife
to
church
which
pleases
me
mightily
i
being
full
of
fear
that
she
would
never
go
to
church
again
after
she
had
declared
to
me
that
she
was
a
roman
catholique
but
though
i
do
verily
think
she
fears
god
and
is
truly
and
sincerely
righteous
yet
i
do
see
she
is
not
so
strictly
a
catholique
as
not
to
go
to
church
with
me
which
pleases
me
mightily
sir
coventry
says
that
he
hath
no
more
mind
to
be
found
meddling
with
the
navy
lest
it
should
do
it
hurt
as
well
as
him
so
to
talk
of
general
things
and
telling
him
that
with
all
these
doings
he
i
thanked
god
stood
yet
he
told
me
yes
but
that
he
thought
his
continuing
in
did
arise
from
his
enemies
my
lord
of
buckingham
and
arlington
seeing
that
he
cared
so
little
if
he
was
out
and
he
do
protest
to
me
that
he
is
as
weary
of
the
treasury
as
ever
he
was
of
the
navy
he
tells
me
that
he
do
believe
that
their
heat
is
over
almost
as
to
the
navy
their
being
now
none
left
of
the
old
stock
but
my
lord
brouncker
minnes
who
is
ready
to
leave
the
world
and
myself
but
he
tells
me
that
he
do
foresee
very
great
wants
and
great
disorders
by
reason
thereof
insomuch
as
he
is
represented
to
the
king
by
his
enemies
as
a
melancholy
man
and
one
that
is
still
prophecying
ill
events
so
as
the
king
called
him
visionaire
which
being
told
him
he
said
he
answered
the
party
that
whatever
he
foresaw
he
was
not
afraid
as
to
himself
of
any
thing
nor
particularly
of
my
lord
arlington
so
much
as
the
duke
of
buckingham
hath
been
nor
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
so
much
as
my
lord
arlington
at
this
time
is
but
he
tells
me
that
he
hath
been
always
looked
upon
as
a
melancholy
man
whereas
others
that
would
please
the
king
do
make
him
believe
that
all
is
safe
and
so
he
hath
heard
my
lord
chancellor
openly
say
to
the
king
that
he
was
now
a
glorious
prince
and
in
a
glorious
condition
because
of
some
one
accident
that
hath
happened
or
some
one
rut
that
hath
been
removed
when
says
sir
coventry
they
reckoned
their
one
good
meal
without
considering
that
there
was
nothing
left
in
the
cupboard
for
after
this
discourse
to
my
lord
sandwich
and
took
a
quarter
of
an
walk
in
the
garden
with
him
which
i
have
not
done
for
so
much
time
with
him
since
his
coming
into
england
and
talking
of
his
own
condition
and
particularly
of
the
world
talk
of
his
going
to
tangier
i
find
if
his
conditions
can
be
made
profitable
and
safe
as
to
money
he
would
go
but
not
else
but
however
will
seem
not
averse
to
it
because
of
facilitating
his
other
accounts
now
depending
which
be
finds
hard
to
get
through
but
yet
hath
some
hopes
the
king
he
says
speaking
very
kindly
to
him
up
and
sir
cholmly
betimes
with
me
about
some
accounts
and
monies
due
to
him
and
he
gone
i
to
the
office
where
sat
all
the
morning
and
here
among
other
things
breaks
out
the
storm
hewer
and
i
have
long
expected
from
the
surveyor
about
hewer
conspiring
to
get
a
contract
to
the
burdening
of
the
stores
with
kerseys
and
cottons
of
which
he
hath
often
complained
and
lately
more
than
ever
and
now
he
did
by
a
most
scandalous
letter
to
the
board
reflecting
on
my
office
and
by
discourse
it
fell
to
such
high
words
between
him
and
me
as
can
hardly
ever
be
forgot
i
declaring
i
would
believe
hewer
as
soon
as
him
and
laying
the
fault
if
there
be
any
upon
himself
he
on
the
other
hand
vilifying
of
my
word
and
hewer
calling
him
knave
and
that
if
he
were
his
clerk
he
should
lose
his
ears
at
last
i
closed
the
business
for
this
morning
with
making
the
thing
ridiculous
as
it
is
and
he
swearing
that
the
king
should
have
right
in
it
or
he
would
lose
his
place
the
office
was
cleared
of
all
but
ourselves
and
hewer
but
however
the
world
did
by
the
beginning
see
what
it
meant
and
it
will
i
believe
come
to
high
terms
between
us
which
i
am
sorry
for
to
have
any
blemish
laid
upon
me
or
mine
at
this
time
though
never
so
unjustly
for
fear
of
giving
occasion
to
my
real
discredit
and
therefore
i
was
not
only
all
the
rest
of
the
morning
vexed
but
so
went
home
to
dinner
where
my
wife
tells
me
of
my
lord
orrery
new
play
tryphon
a
tragedy
taken
from
the
first
book
of
maccabees
and
performed
with
great
success
at
the
duke
of
york
house
which
however
i
would
see
and
therefore
put
a
bit
of
meat
in
our
mouths
and
went
thither
where
with
much
ado
at
one
we
got
into
a
blind
hole
in
the
place
above
stairs
where
we
could
not
hear
well
the
house
infinite
fill
but
the
prologue
most
silly
and
the
play
though
admirable
yet
no
pleasure
almost
in
it
because
just
the
very
same
design
and
words
and
sense
and
plot
as
every
one
of
his
plays
have
any
one
of
which
alone
would
be
held
admirable
whereas
so
many
of
the
same
design
and
fancy
do
but
dull
one
another
and
this
i
perceive
is
the
sense
of
every
body
else
as
well
as
myself
who
therefore
showed
but
little
pleasure
in
it
so
home
mighty
hot
and
my
mind
mightily
out
of
order
so
as
i
could
not
eat
my
supper
or
sleep
almost
all
night
though
i
spent
till
twelve
at
night
with
hewer
to
consider
of
our
business
and
we
find
it
not
only
most
free
from
any
blame
of
our
side
but
so
horrid
scandalous
on
the
other
to
make
so
groundless
a
complaint
and
one
so
shameful
to
him
that
it
could
not
but
let
me
see
that
there
is
no
need
of
my
being
troubled
but
such
is
the
weakness
of
my
nature
that
i
could
not
help
it
which
vexes
me
showing
me
how
unable
i
am
to
live
with
difficulties
up
and
to
the
office
where
busy
all
the
morning
middleton
not
there
so
no
words
or
looks
of
him
at
noon
home
to
dinner
and
so
to
the
office
and
there
all
the
afternoon
busy
and
at
night
hewer
home
with
me
and
we
think
we
have
got
matter
enough
to
make
middleton
appear
a
coxcomb
but
it
troubled
me
to
have
sir
warren
meet
me
at
night
going
out
of
the
office
home
and
tell
me
that
middleton
do
intend
to
complain
to
the
duke
of
york
but
upon
consideration
of
the
business
i
did
go
to
bed
satisfied
that
it
was
best
for
me
that
he
should
and
so
my
trouble
was
over
and
to
bed
and
slept
well
up
and
with
hewer
by
water
to
and
there
i
to
my
lord
brouncker
before
he
went
forth
to
the
duke
of
york
and
there
told
him
my
confidence
that
i
should
make
middleton
appear
a
fool
and
that
it
was
i
thought
best
for
me
to
complain
of
the
wrong
he
hath
done
but
brought
it
about
that
my
lord
desired
me
i
would
forbear
and
promised
that
he
would
prevent
middleton
till
i
had
given
in
my
answer
to
the
board
which
i
desired
and
so
away
to
white
hall
and
there
did
our
usual
attendance
and
no
word
spoke
before
the
duke
of
york
by
middleton
at
all
at
which
i
was
glad
to
my
heart
because
by
this
means
i
have
time
to
draw
up
my
answer
to
my
mind
concluded
upon
giving
for
a
fine
pair
of
black
horses
we
saw
this
day
and
so
set
pickering
down
near
his
house
whom
i
am
much
beholden
to
for
his
care
herein
and
he
hath
admirable
skill
i
perceive
in
this
business
and
so
home
i
hear
this
day
that
there
is
fallen
down
a
new
house
not
quite
finished
in
and
that
there
have
been
several
so
they
making
use
of
bad
mortar
and
bricks
but
no
hurt
yet
as
god
hath
ordered
it
this
day
was
brought
home
my
pair
of
black
the
first
i
ever
was
master
of
a
fine
pair
this
day
i
hear
and
am
glad
that
the
king
hath
prorogued
the
parliament
to
october
next
and
among
other
reasons
it
will
give
me
time
to
go
to
france
i
hope
up
and
to
the
office
where
sat
all
the
morning
and
the
new
treasurers
there
and
for
my
life
i
can
not
keep
sir
minnes
and
others
of
the
board
from
showing
our
weakness
to
the
dishonour
of
the
board
though
i
am
not
concerned
but
it
do
vex
me
to
the
heart
to
have
it
before
these
people
that
would
be
glad
to
find
out
all
our
weaknesses
to
lord
brouncker
and
got
him
to
read
over
my
paper
who
owns
most
absolute
content
in
it
and
the
advantages
i
have
in
it
and
the
folly
of
the
surveyor
at
noon
home
to
dinner
and
then
to
and
there
spoke
with
colonell
thomson
i
by
order
carrying
them
our
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
late
war
i
found
him
finding
of
errors
in
a
book
where
he
showed
me
many
which
must
end
in
the
ruin
i
doubt
of
the
controller
who
found
them
not
out
in
the
pay
of
the
ship
or
the
whole
office
to
the
office
and
after
some
other
business
done
we
fell
to
mine
the
surveyor
began
to
be
a
little
brisk
at
the
beginning
but
when
i
came
to
the
point
to
touch
him
which
i
had
all
the
advantages
in
the
world
to
do
he
became
as
calm
as
a
lamb
and
owned
as
the
whole
board
did
their
satisfaction
and
cried
excuse
and
so
all
made
friends
and
their
acknowledgment
put
into
writing
and
delivered
into
sir
minnes
hand
to
be
kept
there
for
the
use
of
the
board
or
us
when
i
shall
call
for
it
they
desiring
it
might
be
so
that
i
might
not
make
use
of
it
to
the
prejudice
of
the
surveyor
whom
i
had
an
advantage
over
by
his
extraordinary
folly
in
this
matter
so
middleton
desiring
to
be
friends
i
forgave
him
and
all
mighty
quiet
and
fell
to
talk
of
other
stories
and
there
staid
all
of
us
till
nine
or
ten
at
night
more
than
ever
we
did
in
our
lives
before
together
my
wife
and
i
by
hackney
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
the
pit
being
full
sat
in
the
box
above
and
saw
catiline
conspiracy
yesterday
being
the
first
day
a
play
of
much
good
sense
and
words
to
read
but
that
do
appear
the
worst
upon
the
stage
i
mean
the
least
diverting
that
ever
i
saw
any
though
most
fine
in
clothes
and
a
fine
scene
of
the
senate
and
of
a
fight
as
ever
i
saw
in
my
life
we
sat
next
to
betty
hall
that
did
belong
to
this
house
and
was
sir
philip
mistress
a
mighty
pretty
wench
the
duke
of
york
in
good
humour
did
fall
to
tell
us
many
fine
stories
of
the
wars
in
flanders
and
how
the
spaniards
are
the
best
disciplined
foot
in
the
world
will
refuse
no
extraordinary
service
if
commanded
but
scorn
to
be
paid
for
it
as
in
other
countries
though
at
the
same
time
they
will
beg
in
the
streets
not
a
soldier
will
carry
you
a
for
money
for
the
world
though
he
will
beg
a
penny
and
will
do
the
thing
if
commanded
by
his
commander
that
in
the
citadel
of
antwerp
a
soldier
hath
not
a
liberty
of
begging
till
he
hath
served
three
years
they
will
cry
out
against
their
king
and
commanders
and
generals
none
like
them
in
the
world
and
yet
will
not
hear
a
stranger
say
a
word
of
them
but
they
will
cut
his
throat
that
upon
a
time
some
of
the
commanders
of
their
army
exclaiming
against
their
generals
and
particularly
the
marquis
of
caranen
the
confessor
of
the
marquis
coming
by
and
hearing
them
he
stops
and
gravely
tells
them
that
the
three
great
trades
of
the
world
are
the
lawyers
who
govern
the
world
the
churchmen
who
enjoy
the
world
and
a
sort
of
fellows
whom
they
call
soldiers
who
make
it
their
work
to
defend
the
world
he
told
us
too
that
turenne
being
now
become
a
catholique
he
is
likely
to
get
over
the
head
of
colbert
their
interests
being
contrary
the
latter
to
promote
trade
and
the
sea
which
says
the
duke
of
york
is
that
we
have
most
cause
to
fear
and
turenne
to
employ
the
king
and
his
forces
by
land
to
encrease
his
conquests
hewer
tells
me
that
he
hears
that
the
king
of
france
hath
declared
in
print
that
he
do
intend
this
next
summer
to
forbid
his
commanders
to
strike
to
us
but
that
both
we
and
the
dutch
shall
strike
to
him
and
that
he
hath
made
his
captains
swear
it
already
that
they
will
observe
it
which
is
a
great
thing
if
he
do
it
as
i
know
nothing
to
hinder
him
went
into
holborne
and
there
saw
the
woman
that
is
to
be
seen
with
a
beard
she
is
a
little
plain
woman
a
dane
her
name
ursula
dyan
about
forty
years
old
her
voice
like
a
little
girl
with
a
beard
as
much
as
any
man
i
ever
saw
black
almost
and
grizly
it
began
to
grow
at
about
seven
years
old
and
was
shaved
not
above
seven
months
ago
and
is
now
so
big
as
any
almost
that
ever
i
saw
i
say
bushy
and
thick
it
was
a
strange
sight
to
me
i
confess
and
what
pleased
me
mightily
thence
to
the
duke
playhouse
and
saw
macbeth
the
king
and
court
there
and
we
sat
just
under
them
and
my
lady
castlemaine
and
close
to
a
woman
that
comes
into
the
pit
a
kind
of
a
loose
gossip
that
pretends
to
be
like
her
and
is
so
something
and
my
wife
by
my
troth
appeared
i
think
as
pretty
as
any
of
them
i
never
thought
so
much
before
and
so
did
talbot
and
w
hewer
as
they
said
i
heard
to
one
another
the
king
and
duke
of
york
minded
me
and
smiled
upon
me
at
the
handsome
woman
near
me
but
it
vexed
me
to
see
moll
davis
in
the
box
over
the
king
and
my
lady
castlemaine
look
down
upon
the
king
and
he
up
to
her
and
so
did
my
lady
castlemaine
once
to
see
who
it
was
but
when
she
saw
moll
davis
she
looked
like
fire
which
troubled
me
discoursed
with
sir
john
bankes
who
thinks
this
prorogation
will
please
all
but
the
parliament
itself
which
will
if
ever
they
meet
be
vexed
at
buckingham
who
yet
governs
all
he
says
the
nonconformists
are
glad
of
it
and
he
believes
will
get
the
upper
hand
in
a
little
time
for
the
king
must
trust
to
them
or
nobody
and
he
thinks
the
king
will
be
forced
to
it
he
says
that
sir
gauden
is
mightily
troubled
at
pen
being
put
upon
him
by
the
duke
of
york
and
that
he
believes
he
will
get
clear
of
it
which
though
it
will
trouble
me
to
have
pen
still
at
the
office
yet
i
shall
think
gauden
do
well
in
it
and
what
i
would
advise
him
to
because
i
love
him
i
up
to
my
lord
brouncker
at
his
lodgings
and
sat
with
him
an
hour
on
purpose
to
talk
over
the
wretched
state
of
this
office
at
present
according
to
the
present
hands
it
is
made
up
of
wherein
he
do
fully
concur
with
me
and
that
it
is
our
part
not
only
to
prepare
for
defending
it
and
ourselves
against
the
consequences
of
it
but
to
take
the
best
ways
we
can
to
make
it
known
to
the
duke
of
york
for
till
sir
minnes
be
removed
and
a
sufficient
man
brought
into
pen
place
when
he
is
gone
it
is
impossible
for
this
office
to
support
itself
christmas
day
to
dinner
alone
with
my
wife
who
poor
wretch
sat
undressed
all
day
till
ten
at
night
altering
and
lacing
of
a
noble
petticoat
while
i
by
her
making
the
boy
read
to
me
the
life
of
julius
caesar
and
des
cartes
book
of
musick
lord
day
saw
the
king
at
chapel
but
staid
not
to
hear
any
thing
but
went
to
walk
in
the
park
with
hewer
and
there
among
others
met
with
sir
downing
and
walked
with
him
an
hour
talking
of
business
and
how
the
late
war
was
managed
there
being
nobody
to
take
care
of
it
and
he
telling
when
he
was
in
holland
what
he
offered
the
king
to
do
if
he
might
have
power
and
then
upon
the
least
word
perhaps
of
a
woman
to
the
king
he
was
contradicted
again
and
particularly
to
the
loss
of
all
that
we
lost
in
guinny
he
told
me
that
he
had
so
good
spies
that
he
hath
had
the
keys
taken
out
of
de
witt
pocket
when
he
was
bed
and
his
closet
opened
and
papers
brought
to
him
and
left
in
his
hands
for
an
hour
and
carried
back
and
laid
in
the
place
again
and
keys
put
into
his
pocket
again
he
says
he
hath
always
had
their
most
private
debates
that
have
been
but
between
two
or
three
of
the
chief
of
them
brought
to
him
in
an
hour
after
and
an
hour
after
that
hath
sent
word
thereof
to
the
king
but
nobody
here
regarded
them
but
he
tells
me
the
sad
news
that
he
is
out
of
all
expectations
that
ever
the
debts
of
the
navy
will
be
paid
if
the
parliament
do
not
enable
the
king
to
do
it
by
money
all
they
can
hope
for
to
do
out
of
the
king
revenue
being
but
to
keep
our
wheels
on
present
services
and
if
they
can
to
cut
off
the
growing
interest
which
is
a
sad
story
and
grieves
me
to
the
heart
called
up
by
drums
and
trumpets
these
things
and
boxes
having
cost
me
much
money
this
christmas
already
and
will
do
more
january
presented
from
captain
beckford
with
a
noble
silver
hewer
and
i
went
and
saw
the
great
tall
woman
that
is
to
be
seen
who
is
but
years
old
and
i
do
easily
stand
under
her
arms
to
white
hall
where
a
committee
of
tangier
met
and
i
did
receive
an
instance
of
the
duke
of
york
kindness
to
me
and
the
whole
committee
that
they
would
not
order
any
thing
about
the
treasury
for
the
corporation
now
in
establishing
without
my
assent
and
considering
whether
it
would
be
to
my
wrong
or
no
thence
up
and
down
the
house
and
to
the
duke
of
side
and
there
in
the
duchesse
presence
and
was
mightily
complimented
by
my
lady
peterborough
in
my
lord
presence
whom
she
engaged
to
thank
me
for
my
kindness
to
her
and
her
lord
we
also
declared
our
minds
together
to
the
duke
of
york
about
sir
john
minnes
incapacity
to
do
any
service
in
the
office
he
promised
to
speak
to
the
king
about
it
my
wife
and
i
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
island
princesse
a
by
beaumont
and
fletcher
the
first
time
i
ever
saw
it
and
it
is
a
pretty
good
play
many
good
things
being
in
it
and
a
good
scene
of
a
town
on
fire
we
sat
in
an
upper
box
and
the
jade
nell
came
and
sat
in
the
next
box
a
bold
merry
slut
who
lay
laughing
there
upon
people
and
with
a
comrade
of
hers
of
the
duke
house
that
came
in
to
see
the
play
abroad
with
my
wife
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
joviall
crew
but
ill
acted
to
what
it
was
heretofore
in
clun
time
and
when
lacy
could
dance
thence
to
the
new
exchange
to
buy
some
things
and
among
others
my
wife
did
give
me
my
pair
of
gloves
which
by
contract
she
is
to
give
me
in
her

smith
tells
us
of
the
great
murder
thereabouts
on
saturday
last
of
one
captain
bumbridge
by
one
symons
both
of
her
acquaintance
and
hectors
that
were
at
play
and
in
drink
the
former
is
killed
and
is
kinsman
to
my
lord
of
ormond
which
made
him
speak
of
it
with
so
much
passion
pierce
i
asking
him
whither
he
was
going
told
me
as
a
great
secret
that
he
was
going
to
his
master
mistress
churchill
arabella
churchill
sister
to
john
duke
of
marlborough
one
of
the
maids
of
honour
to
the
duchess
of
york
james
duke
of
berwick
and
three
other
children
were
the
fruits
of
this
intrigue
she
married
subsequently
colonel
godfrey
comptroller
of
the
household
and
died
aged
with
some
physic
meaning
i
suppose
that
she
is
with
child
to
sir
coventry
where
with
him
a
good
while
in
his
chamber
talking
of
the
great
factions
at
court
at
this
day
even
to
the
sober
engaging
of
great
persons
and
differences
and
making
the
king
cheap
and
ridiculous
it
is
about
my
lady
harvy
being
offended
at
doll
common
acting
of
sempronia
to
imitate
her
for
which
she
got
my
lord
chamberlain
her
kinsman
to
imprison
doll
upon
which
my
lady
castlemaine
made
the
king
to
release
her
and
to
order
her
to
act
it
again
worse
than
ever
the
other
day
where
the
king
himself
was
and
since
it
was
acted
again
and
my
lady
harvy
provided
people
to
hiss
her
and
fling
oranges
at
her
but
it
seems
the
heat
is
come
to
a
great
height
and
real
troubles
at
court
about
it
through
the
park
where
i
met
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
and
so
walked
with
them
and
i
did
give
the
duke
of
york
thanks
for
his
favour
to
me
yesterday
at
the
committee
of
tangier
in
my
absence
where
some
business
was
brought
forward
which
the
duke
of
york
would
not
suffer
to
go
on
without
my
presence
at
the
debate
and
he
answered
me
just
thus
that
he
ought
to
have
a
care
of
him
that
do
the
business
in
the
manner
that
i
do
and
words
of
more
force
than
that
then
down
with
lord
brouncker
to
sir
murray
into
the
king
little
elaboratory
under
his
closet
a
pretty
place
and
there
saw
a
great
many
chymical
glasses
and
things
but
understood
none
of
them
wren
thinks
that
the
parliament
is
likely
to
meet
again
the
king
being
frighted
with
what
the
speaker
hath
put
him
in
mind
of
his
promise
not
to
prorogue
but
only
to
adjourne
them
they
speak
mighty
freely
of
the
folly
of
the
king
this
foolish
women
business
of
my
lady
harvy
povy
tells
me
that
sir
coventry
was
with
the
king
alone
an
hour
this
day
and
that
my
lady
castlemaine
is
now
in
a
higher
command
over
the
king
than
ever
not
as
a
mistress
for
she
scorns
him
but
as
a
tyrant
to
command
him
and
says
that
the
duchesse
of
york
and
the
duke
of
york
are
mighty
great
with
her
which
is
a
great
interest
to
my
lord
chancellor
family
and
that
they
do
agree
to
hinder
all
they
can
the
proceedings
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
arlington
and
so
we
are
in
the
old
mad
condition
or
rather
worse
than
any
no
man
knowing
what
the
french
intend
to
do
next
summer
spoke
with
my
lord
bellasses
and
peterborough
about
the
business
now
in
dispute
about
my
deputing
a
treasurer
to
pay
the
garrison
at
tangier
which
i
would
avoid
and
not
be
accountable
and
they
will
serve
me
therein
here
i
met
hugh
may
and
he
brings
me
to
the
knowledge
of
sir
harry
capell
made
at
the
coronation
of
charles
ii
and
created
lord
capel
died
at
dublin
while
lord
lieutenant
of
ireland
a
member
of
parliament
and
brother
of
my
lord
essex
arthur
capel
created
earl
of
essex
found
dead
in
the
tower
who
hath
a
great
value
it
seems
for
me
and
they
appoint
a
day
to
come
and
dine
with
me
and
see
my
books
and
papers
of
the
office
which
i
shall
be
glad
to
show
them
and
have
opportunity
to
satisfy
them
therein
here
all
the
discourse
is
that
now
the
king
is
of
opinion
to
have
the
parliament
called
notwithstanding
his
late
resolutions
for
proroguing
them
so
unstable
are
his
councils
and
those
about
him
to
sir
coventry
and
there
discourse
the
business
of
my
treasurer
place
at
tangier
wherein
he
consents
to
my
desire
and
concurs
therein
which
i
am
glad
of
that
i
may
not
be
accountable
for
a
man
so
far
off
and
so
i
to
my
lord
sandwich
and
there
walk
with
him
through
the
garden
to
white
hall
where
he
tells
me
what
he
hath
done
about
this
place
and
i
perceive
the
whole
thing
did
proceed
from
him
that
finding
it
would
be
best
to
have
the
governor
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
pay
of
the
garrison
he
did
propose
to
the
duke
of
york
alone
that
a
paymaster
should
be
there
and
that
being
desirous
to
do
a
courtesy
to
sir
charles
harbord
sir
charles
harbord
for
launceston
and
to
prevent
the
duke
of
looking
out
for
any
body
else
he
did
name
him
to
the
duke
of
york
that
when
be
came
the
other
day
to
move
this
to
the
board
of
tangier
the
duke
of
york
it
seems
readily
reply
that
it
was
fit
to
have
pepys
satisfied
therein
first
an
that
it
was
not
good
to
make
places
for
persons
this
my
lord
in
great
confidence
tells
me
that
he
do
take
very
ill
from
the
duke
of
york
though
nobody
knew
the
meaning
of
these
words
but
him
and
that
he
did
take
no
notice
of
them
but
bit
his
lip
being
satisfied
that
the
duke
of
york
care
of
me
was
as
desirable
to
him
as
it
could
be
to
have
sir
charles
harbord
and
did
seem
industrious
to
let
me
see
that
he
was
glad
that
the
duke
of
york
and
he
might
come
to
contend
who
shall
be
the
kindest
to
me
which
i
owned
as
his
great
love
and
so
i
hope
and
believe
it
is
though
my
lord
did
go
a
little
too
far
in
this
business
to
move
it
so
far
without
consulting
me
but
i
took
no
notice
of
that
but
was
glad
to
see
this
competition
come
about
that
my
lord
sandwich
is
apparently
jealous
of
my
thinking
that
the
duke
of
york
do
mean
me
more
kindness
than
him
so
we
walked
together
and
i
took
this
occasion
to
invite
him
to
dinner
to
my
house
and
he
readily
appointed
friday
next
which
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
over
to
his
content
he
having
never
yet
eat
a
bit
of
my
bread
thence
to
the
duke
of
york
on
the
king
side
and
meeting
sidney
montagu
and
sheres
a
small
invitation
served
their
turn
to
carry
them
to
london
where
i
paid
sheres
his
given
him
for
his
pains
in
drawing
the
plate
of
tangier
fortifications
at
white
hall
and
there
in
the
queenes
invited
my
lord
peterborough
to
dine
with
me
with
my
lord
sandwich
who
readily
accepted
it
to
the
king
house
to
see
horace
there
were
two
translations
about
this
period
of
the
horace
of
corneille
one
by
charles
cotton
the
other
which
was
performed
at
court
by
catherine
phillips
the
fifth
act
being
added
by
sir
john
denham
this
the
third
day
of
its
acting
a
silly
tragedy
but
lacy
hath
made
a
farce
of
several
dances
between
each
act
one
but
his
words
are
but
silly
and
invention
not
extraordinary
as
to
the
dances
only
some
dutchmen
come
out
of
the
mouth
and
tail
of
a
hamburgh
sow
heard
at
the
the
city
by
their
single
counsel
symson
and
the
company
of
strangers
merchants
debate
the
business
of
a
tax
demanded
upon
all
goods
by
the
city
imported
and
exported
which
these
merchants
oppose
and
demanding
leave
to
try
the
justice
of
the
city
demand
by
a
quo
warranto
which
the
city
opposed
the
merchants
did
quite
lay
the
city
on
their
backs
with
great
triumph
the
city
cause
being
apparently
too
weak
but
here
i
observed
gold
the
merchant
to
speak
very
well
and
very
sharply
against
the
city
this
afternoon
before
the
play
i
called
with
my
wife
at
dancre
henry
dankers
born
at
the
hague
employed
by
charles
ii
to
paint
views
of
his
and
palaces
he
followed
his
profession
for
some
years
in
london
the
great
painter
by
povy
advice
and
have
bespoke
him
to
come
to
take
measure
of
my
panels
at
the
i
met
with
dancre
with
whom
i
was
on
wednesday
and
he
took
measure
of
my
panels
in
my
where
in
the
four
i
intend
to
have
the
four
houses
of
the
king
white
hall
hampton
court
greenwich
and
windsor
mightily
pleased
with
the
fellow
that
came
to
lay
the
cloth
and
fold
the
napkins
which
i
like
so
well
as
that
i
am
resolved
to
give
him
to
teach
my
wife
to
do
it
to
the
office
till
noon
when
word
brought
me
that
my
lord
sandwich
was
come
so
i
presently
rose
and
there
i
found
my
lords
sandwich
peterborough
and
sir
charles
harbord
and
presently
after
them
comes
my
lord
hichingbroke
sidney
and
sir
william
godolphin
and
after
greeting
them
and
some
time
spent
in
talk
dinner
was
brought
up
one
dish
after
another
but
a
dish
at
a
time
but
all
so
good
but
above
all
things
the
variety
of
wines
and
excellent
of
their
kind
i
had
for
them
and
all
in
so
good
order
that
they
were
mightily
pleased
and
myself
full
of
content
at
it
and
indeed
it
was
of
a
dinner
of
about
six
or
eight
dishes
as
noble
as
any
man
need
to
have
i
think
at
least
all
was
done
in
the
noblest
manner
that
ever
i
had
any
and
i
have
rarely
seen
in
my
life
better
any
where
else
even
at
the
court
after
dinner
my
lords
to
cards
and
the
rest
of
us
sitting
about
them
and
talking
and
looking
on
my
books
and
pictures
and
my
wife
drawings
which
they
commended
mightily
and
mighty
merry
all
day
long
with
exceeding
great
content
and
so
till
seven
at
night
and
so
took
their
leaves
it
being
dark
and
foul
weather
thus
was
this
entertainment
over
the
best
of
its
kind
and
the
fullest
of
honour
and
content
to
me
that
ever
i
had
in
my
life
and
i
shall
not
easily
have
so
good
again

post
from
france
his
boots
all
dirty
he
brought
letters
to
the
king
and
i
glad
to
see
him
it
having
been
reported
that
he
was
drowned
for
some
days
past
by
and
by
the
king
comes
out
and
so
i
took
coach
and
followed
his
coaches
to
my
lord
keeper
at
where
i
never
was
before
since
i
saw
my
old
lord
essex
lie
in
state
when
he
was
dead
a
large
but
ugly
house
here
all
the
officers
of
the
navy
attended
and
by
and
by
were
called
in
to
the
king
and
cabinet
where
my
lord
who
was
ill
did
lie
upon
the
bed
as
my
old
lord
treasurer
or
chancellor
heretofore
used
to
do
and
the
business
was
to
know
in
what
time
all
the
king
ships
might
be
repaired
fit
for
service
the
surveyor
answered
in
two
years
and
not
sooner
i
did
give
them
hopes
that
with
supplies
of
money
suitable
we
might
have
them
all
fit
for
sea
some
part
of
the
summer
after
this
then
they
demanded
in
what
time
we
could
set
out
forty
ships
it
was
answered
as
they
might
be
chosen
of
the
newest
and
most
ready
we
could
with
money
get
forty
ready
against
may
the
king
seemed
mighty
full
that
we
should
have
money
to
do
all
that
we
desired
and
satisfied
that
without
it
nothing
could
be
done
and
so
without
determining
any
thing
we
were
dismissed
and
i
doubt
all
will
end
in
some
little
fleet
this
year
and
that
of
hired
merchantmen
which
would
indeed
be
cheaper
to
the
king
and
have
many
conveniences
attending
it
more
than
to
fit
out
the
king
own
and
this
i
perceive
is
designed
springing
from
sir
coventry
counsel
and
the
king
and
most
of
the
lords
i
perceive
full
of
it
to
get
the
king
fleet
all
at
once
in
condition
for
service
thence
with
wren
in
his
coach
for
discourse
sake
and
he
told
me
how
the
business
of
the
parliament
is
wholly
laid
aside
it
being
now
that
they
shall
not
meet
but
must
be
prorogued
upon
this
argument
chiefly
that
all
the
differences
between
the
two
houses
and
things
on
foot
that
were
matters
of
difference
and
discontent
may
be
laid
aside
and
must
begin
again
if
ever
the
house
shall
have
a
mind
to
pursue
them
my
wife
showed
me
many
excellent
prints
of
nantueil
and
others
which
batelier
hath
at
my
desire
brought
me
out
of
france
of
the
king
and
colbert
and
others
most
excellent
to
my
great
content
to
the
office
and
then
to
white
hall
leaving
my
wife
at
unthanke
and
i
to
the
secretary
chamber
where
i
was
by
particular
order
this
day
summonsed
to
attend
as
i
find
sir
gauden
also
was
and
here
was
the
king
and
the
cabinet
met
and
being
called
in
among
the
rest
i
find
my
lord
privy
seale
whom
i
never
before
knew
to
be
in
so
much
play
as
to
be
of
the
cabinet
the
business
is
that
the
algerines
have
broke
the
peace
with
us
by
taking
out
some
spaniards
and
goods
out
of
an
english
ship
which
had
the
duke
of
york
pass
of
which
advice
came
this
day
and
the
king
is
resolved
to
stop
sir
thomas
allen
fleet
from
coming
home
till
he
hath
amends
made
him
for
this
affront
and
therefore
sent
for
us
to
advise
about
victuals
to
be
sent
to
that
fleet
and
some
more
ships
wherein
i
answered
them
to
what
they
demanded
of
me
which
was
but
some
few
mean
things
but
i
see
that
on
all
these
occasions
they
seem
to
rely
most
upon
me
to
the
duke
of
york
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
five
hours
adventure
which
hath
not
been
acted
a
good
while
before
but
once
and
is
a
most
excellent
play
i
must
confess
going
home
to
supper
with
my
wife
and
to
get
her
to
read
to
me
i
did
find
that
sheres
hath
beyond
his
promise
not
only
got
me
a
candlestick
made
me
after
a
form
he
remembers
to
have
seen
in
spain
for
keeping
the
light
from
one
eyes
but
hath
got
it
done
in
silver
very
neat
and
designs
to
give
it
me
in
thanks
for
my
paying
him
his
in
money
for
his
service
at
tangier
which
was
ordered
him
but
i
do
intend
to
force
him
to
make
me
pay
for
it
but
i
yet
without
his
direction
can
not
tell
how
it
is
to
be
made
use
of
to
the
duke
of
york
where
i
did
give
a
severe
account
of
our
proceedings
and
what
we
found
in
the
business
of
sir
jenings
demand
of
supernumeraries
i
thought
it
a
good
occasion
to
make
an
example
of
him
for
he
is
a
proud
idle
fellow
and
it
did
meet
with
the
duke
of
york
acceptance
and
and
he
did
call
him
in
after
i
had
done
and
did
not
only
give
him
a
soft
rebuke
but
condemns
him
to
pay
both
their
victuals
and
wages
or
right
himself
of
the
purser
this
i
was
glad
of
and
so
were
all
the
rest
of
us
though
i
know
i
have
made
myself
an
immortal
enemy
by
it
lord
day
to
church
and
there
did
hear
the
doctor
that
is
lately
turned
divine
waterhouse
he
preaches
in
a
devout
manner
not
elegant
nor
very
persuasive
but
seems
to
mean
well
and
that
he
would
preach
holily
and
was
mighty
passionate
against
people
that
make
a
scoff
of
religion
february
meeting
povy
he
and
i
away
to
dancre
to
speak
something
touching
the
pictures
i
am
getting
him
to
make
for
me
and
thence
he
carried
me
to
robert
streater
appointed
serjeant
painter
at
the
restoration
ob
the
famous
over
the
way
whom
i
have
often
heard
of
but
did
never
see
him
before
and
there
i
found
him
and
wren
and
several
virtuosos
looking
upon
the
paintings
which
he
is
making
for
the
new
theatre
at
oxford
and
indeed
they
look
as
if
they
would
be
very
fine
and
the
rest
think
better
than
those
of
rubens
in
the
banqueting
house
at
white
hall
but
i
do
not
so
fully
think
so
but
they
will
certainly
be
very
noble
and
i
am
mightily
pleased
to
have
the
fortune
to
see
this
man
and
his
work
which
is
very
famous
and
he
a
very
civil
little
man
and
lame
but
lives
very
handsomely
so
thence
to
my
lord
bellasses
and
met
him
within
my
business
only
to
see
a
of
dancres
doing
in
distemper
with
egg
to
keep
off
the
glaring
of
the
light
which
i
must
have
done
for
my
room
and
indeed
it
is
pretty
but
i
must
confess
i
do
think
it
is
not
altogether
so
beautiful
as
the
oyle
pictures
but
i
will
have
some
of
one
and
some
of
another
so
to
the
king
playhouse
thinking
to
have
seen
the
heyresse
first
acted
on
saturday
last
but
when
we
come
thither
we
find
no
play
there
kinaston
that
did
act
a
part
therein
in
abuse
to
sir
charles
sedley
being
last
night
exceedingly
beaten
with
sticks
by
two
or
three
that
saluted
him
so
as
he
is
mightily
bruised
and
forced
to
keep
his
bed
to
dinner
at
noon
where
i
find
sheres
and
there
made
a
short
dinner
and
carried
him
with
us
to
the
king
playhouse
where
the
heyresse
notwithstanding
kinaston
being
beaten
is
acted
and
they
say
the
king
is
very
angry
with
sir
charles
sedley
for
his
being
beaten
but
he
do
deny
it
but
his
part
is
done
by
beeston
who
is
fain
to
read
it
out
of
a
book
all
the
while
and
thereby
spoils
the
part
and
almost
the
play
it
being
one
of
the
best
parts
in
it
and
though
the
design
is
in
the
first
conception
of
it
pretty
good
yet
it
is
but
an
indifferent
play
wrote
they
say
by
my
lord
newcastle
the
heiress
does
not
appear
in
the
list
of
the
duke
of
newcastle
works
nor
can
i
find
any
mention
of
it
elsewhere
but
it
was
pleasant
to
see
beeston
come
in
with
others
supposing
it
to
be
dark
and
yet
he
is
forced
to
read
his
part
by
the
light
of
the
candles
and
this
i
observing
to
a
gentleman
that
sat
by
me
he
was
mightily
pleased
therewith
and
spread
it
up
and
down
but
that
that
pleased
me
most
in
the
play
is
the
first
song
that
knipp
sings
she
singing
three
or
four
and
indeed
it
was
very
finely
sung
so
as
to
make
the
whole
house
clap
her
betimes
to
sir
coventry
meaning
by
my
visit
to
keep
fresh
my
interest
in
him
and
he
tells
me
how
it
hath
been
talked
that
he
was
to
go
one
of
the
commissioners
to
ireland
which
he
was
resolved
never
to
do
unless
directly
commanded
for
that
to
go
thither
while
the
chief
secretary
of
state
was
his
professed
enemy
was
to
undo
himself
and
therefore
it
were
better
for
him
to
venture
being
unhappy
here
than
to
go
further
off
to
be
undone
by
some
obscure
instructions
or
whatever
other
way
of
mischief
his
enemy
should
cut
out
for
him
he
mighty
kind
to
me
and
so
parted
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
in
an
upper
box
where
come
in
colonell
poynton
and
moll
stacey
who
is
very
fine
and
by
her
i
suppose
he
hath
married
her
at
last
did
see
the
moor
of
venice
but
ill
acted
in
most
parts
moone
which
did
a
little
surprise
me
not
acting
iago
part
by
much
so
well
as
clun
used
to
do
nor
another
hart
which
was
cassio
nor
indeed
burt
doing
the
moor
so
well
as
i
once
thought
he
did
thence
home
and
just
at
the
bolt
broke
that
holds
the
to
the
perch
and
so
the
horses
went
away
with
them
and
left
the
coachman
and
us
but
being
near
our
and
we
staying
in
a
little
ironmonger
shop
we
were
presently
supplied
with
another
to
visit
my
lord
sandwich
and
there
while
my
lord
was
dressing
himself
did
see
a
young
spaniard
that
he
hath
brought
over
with
him
dance
which
he
is
admired
for
as
the
best
dancer
in
spain
and
indeed
he
do
with
mighty
mastery
but
i
do
not
like
his
dancing
as
well
as
the
english
though
my
lord
commends
it
mightily
but
i
will
have
him
to
my
house
and
show
it
my
wife
here
i
met
with
moore
who
tells
me
the
state
of
my
accounts
of
his
embassy
which
i
find
not
so
good
as
i
thought
for
though
it
be
passed
the
king
and
his
caball
the
committee
for
foreign
affairs
as
they
are
called
yet
they
have
cut
off
from
full
and
have
now
sent
it
to
the
lords
of
the
treasury
who
though
the
committee
have
allowed
the
rest
yet
they
are
not
obliged
to
abide
by
it
so
that
i
do
fear
this
account
may
yet
be
long
ere
it
be
passed
much
more
ere
that
sum
be
paid
i
am
sorry
for
the
family
to
the
king
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
island
princesse
which
i
like
mighty
well
as
an
excellent
play
and
here
we
find
kinaston
to
be
well
enough
to
act
again
which
he
do
very
well
after
his
beating
by
sir
charles
sedley
appointment
to
the
plaisterer
at
charing
cross
that
casts
heads
and
bodies
in
plaister
and
there
i
had
my
whole
face
done
but
i
was
vexed
first
to
be
forced
to
daub
all
my
face
over
with
pomatum
thus
was
the
mold
made
but
when
it
came
off
there
was
little
pleasure
in
it
as
it
looks
in
the
mold
nor
any
resemblance
whatever
there
will
be
in
the
figure
when
i
come
to
see
it
cast
off
to
white
hall
where
i
staid
till
the
duke
of
york
came
from
hunting
which
he
did
by
and
by
and
when
dressed
did
come
out
to
dinner
and
there
i
waited
and
he
did
mightly
magnify
his
sauce
which
he
did
then
eat
with
every
thing
and
said
it
was
the
best
universal
sauce
in
the
world
it
being
taught
him
by
the
spanish
embassador
made
of
some
parsley
and
a
dry
toast
beat
in
a
mortar
together
with
vinegar
salt
and
a
little
pepper
he
eats
it
with
flesh
or
fowl
or
fish
and
then
he
did
now
mightily
commend
some
new
sort
of
wine
lately
found
out
called
navarr
wine
which
i
tasted
and
is
i
think
good
wine
but
i
did
like
better
the
notion
of
the
sauce
and
by
and
by
did
taste
it
and
liked
it
mightily
after
dinner
i
did
what
i
went
for
which
was
to
get
his
consent
that
balty
might
hold
his
place
by
deputy
in
his
new
employment
which
i
design
for
him
about
the
accounts
which
the
duke
of
york
did
grant
me
and
i
was
mightily
glad
of
it
to
wait
on
the
duke
of
york
with
the
rest
of
us
at
the
robes
where
the
duke
of
york
did
tell
us
that
the
king
would
have
us
prepare
a
draught
of
the
present
administration
of
the
navy
and
what
it
was
in
the
late
times
in
order
to
his
being
able
to
distinguish
between
the
good
and
the
bad
which
i
shall
do
but
to
do
it
well
will
give
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
here
we
showed
him
sir
minnes
propositions
about
balancing
keeper
accounts
and
i
did
show
him
hosier
which
did
please
him
mightily
and
he
will
have
it
showed
the
council
and
king
anon
to
be
put
in
practice
thence
to
the
treasurer
and
i
and
sir
minnes
and
tippets
down
to
the
lords
commissioners
of
the
treasury
and
there
had
a
hot
debate
from
sir
thomas
clifford
and
my
lord
ashly
the
latter
of
whom
i
hear
is
turning
about
as
fast
as
he
can
to
the
duke
buckingham
side
being
in
danger
it
seems
of
being
otherwise
out
of
play
which
would
not
be
convenient
for
him
against
sir
coventry
and
sir
duncomb
who
did
uphold
our
office
against
an
accusation
of
our
treasurers
who
told
the
lords
that
they
found
that
we
had
run
the
king
in
debt
or
more
more
than
the
money
appointed
for
the
year
would
defray
which
they
declared
like
fools
and
with
design
to
hurt
us
though
the
thing
is
in
itself
ridiculous
but
my
lord
ashly
and
clifford
did
most
horribly
cry
out
against
the
want
of
method
in
the
office
at
last
it
came
that
it
should
be
put
in
writing
what
they
had
to
object
but
i
was
devilish
mad
at
it
to
see
us
thus
wounded
by
our
own
members
attended
with
lord
brouncker
the
king
and
council
about
the
proposition
of
balancing
accounts
and
there
presented
book
and
it
was
mighty
well
resented
resent
to
take
well
or
ill
johnson
and
approved
of
so
the
council
being
up
we
to
the
queene
side
with
the
king
and
duke
of
york
and
the
duke
of
york
did
take
me
out
to
talk
of
our
treasurers
whom
he
is
mighty
angry
with
and
i
perceive
he
is
mighty
desirous
to
bring
in
as
many
good
motions
of
profit
and
reformation
in
the
navy
as
he
can
before
the
treasurers
do
light
upon
them
they
being
desirous
it
seems
to
be
thought
the
great
reformers
and
the
duke
of
york
do
well
but
to
my
great
joy
he
is
mighty
open
to
me
in
every
thing
and
by
this
means
i
know
his
whole
mind
and
shall
be
able
to
secure
myself
if
he
stands
here
i
understand
by
my
lord
brouncker
that
at
last
it
is
concluded
on
by
the
king
and
buckingham
that
my
lord
of
ormond
shall
not
hold
his
government
of
ireland
which
is
a
great
stroke
to
show
the
power
of
buckingham
and
the
poor
spirit
of
the
king
and
little
hold
that
any
man
can
have
of
him
home
and
there
pelling
hath
got
pen
book
against
the
trinity
i
got
my
wife
to
read
it
to
me
and
i
find
it
so
well
writ
as
i
think
it
is
too
good
for
him
ever
to
have
writ
it
and
it
is
a
serious
sort
of
book
and
not
fit
for
every
body
to
read
lord
day
up
and
by
coach
to
sir
coventry
and
there
he
tells
me
he
takes
no
more
care
for
any
thing
more
than
in
the
treasury
and
that
that
being
done
be
goes
to
cards
and
other
delights
as
plays
and
in
the
to
bowles
but
here
he
did
show
me
two
or
three
old
books
of
the
navy
of
my
lord
northumberland
algernon
percy
tenth
earl
of
northumberland
made
lord
high
admiral
times
which
he
hath
taken
many
good
notes
out
of
for
justifying
the
duke
of
york
and
us
in
many
things
wherein
perhaps
precedent
will
be
necessary
to
produce
thence
to
white
hall
where
the
duke
of
york
expected
me
and
in
his
closet
wren
and
i
he
did
tell
me
how
the
king
hath
been
acquainted
with
the
treasurers
discourse
at
the
lords
commissioners
of
the
treasury
the
other
day
and
is
dissatisfied
with
our
running
him
in
debt
which
i
removed
and
he
did
carry
me
to
the
king
and
i
did
satisfy
him
also
but
his
satisfaction
is
nothing
worth
it
being
easily
got
and
easily
removed
but
i
do
purpose
to
put
it
in
writing
that
shall
make
the
treasurers
ashamed
but
the
duke
of
york
is
horrid
angry
against
them
and
he
hath
cause
for
they
do
work
all
they
can
to
bring
dishonour
upon
his
management
as
do
plainly
appear
in
all
they
do
having
done
with
the
duke
of
york
who
do
repose
all
in
me
i
with
wren
to
his
chamber
to
talk
where
he
observed
that
these
people
are
all
of
them
a
broken
sort
of
people
that
have
not
much
to
lose
and
therefore
will
venture
all
to
make
their
fortunes
better
that
sir
thomas
osborne
is
a
beggar
having
or
but
owes
above
the
duke
of
condition
is
shortly
this
that
he
hath
about
of
which
he
pays
away
about
in
interest
about
in
rents
to
the
king
about
in
wages
and
pensions
and
the
rest
to
live
upon
and
pay
taxes
for
the
whole
wren
says
that
for
the
duke
of
york
to
stir
in
this
matter
as
his
quality
might
justify
would
but
make
all
things
worse
and
that
therefore
he
must
bend
and
suger
all
till
time
works
it
out
that
he
fears
they
will
sacrifice
the
church
and
that
the
king
will
take
any
thing
and
so
he
holds
up
his
head
a
little
longer
and
then
break
in
pieces
but
sir
coventry
did
day
mightily
magnify
my
late
lord
treasurer
for
a
wise
and
solid
though
infirm
man
and
among
other
things
that
when
he
hath
said
it
was
impossible
in
nature
to
find
this
or
that
sum
of
money
and
my
lord
chancellor
hath
made
sport
of
it
and
told
the
king
that
when
my
lord
hath
said
it
was
impossible
yet
he
hath
made
shift
to
find
it
and
that
was
by
sir
carteret
getting
credit
my
lord
did
once
in
his
hearing
say
thus
which
he
magnifies
as
a
great
saying
that
impossible
would
be
found
impossible
at
last
meaning
that
the
king
would
run
himself
out
beyond
all
his
credit
and
funds
and
then
we
should
too
late
find
it
impossible
which
is
he
says
now
come
to
pass
to
the
plaisterer
and
there
saw
the
figure
of
my
face
taken
from
the
mould
and
it
is
most
admirably
like
and
i
will
have
another
made
before
i
take
it
away
at
the
i
did
at
my
bookseller
shop
accidentally
fall
into
talk
with
sir
samuel
tuke
sir
samuel
tuke
of
cressing
temple
essex
bart
was
a
colonel
in
charles
the
first
army
and
cosen
to
evelyn
he
died
at
january
about
trees
and
evelyn
garden
and
i
do
find
him
i
think
a
little
conceited
but
a
man
of
very
fine
discourse
as
any
i
ever
heard
almost
which
i
was
mighty
glad
of
in
lives
moll
davies
and
we
did
see
her
coach
come
for
her
to
her
door
a
mighty
pretty
fine
coach
to
white
hall
and
there
by
means
of
cooling
did
get
into
the
play
the
only
one
we
have
seen
this
winter
it
was
the
five
hours
adventure
but
i
sat
so
far
i
could
not
hear
well
nor
was
there
any
pretty
woman
that
i
did
see
but
my
wife
who
sat
in
my
lady
fox
pew
with
her
the
house
very
full
and
late
before
done
so
that
it
was
past
eleven
before
we
got
home
the
king
dining
yesterday
at
the
dutch
embassador
after
dinner
they
drank
and
were
pretty
merry
and
among
the
rest
of
the
king
company
there
was
that
worthy
fellow
my
lord
of
rochester
and
tom
killigrew
whose
mirth
and
raillery
offended
the
former
so
much
that
he
did
give
tom
killigrew
a
box
on
the
ear
in
the
king
presence
which
do
give
much
offence
to
the
people
here
at
court
to
see
how
cheap
the
king
makes
himself
and
the
more
for
that
the
king
hath
not
only
passed
by
the
thing
and
pardoned
it
to
rochester
already
but
this
very
morning
the
king
did
publicly
walk
up
and
down
and
rochester
i
saw
with
him
as
free
as
ever
to
the
king
everlasting
shame
to
have
so
idle
a
rogue
his
companion
how
tom
killigrew
takes
it
i
do
not
hear
i
do
also
this
day
hear
that
my
lord
do
accept
to
go
lieutenant
into
ireland
but
whether
it
be
true
or
no
i
can
not
tell
to
colonel
middleton
to
the
burial
of
his
wife
where
we
were
all
invited
and
much
more
company
and
had
each
of
us
a
ring
at
church
there
was
my
lord
brouncker
and
williams
in
our
pew
the
first
time
they
were
ever
there
or
that
i
knew
that
either
of
them
would
go
to
church
this
morning
among
other
things
talking
with
sir
coventry
i
did
propose
to
him
my
putting
in
to
serve
in
parliament
if
there
should
as
the
world
begins
to
expect
be
a
new
one
chose
he
likes
it
mightily
both
for
the
king
and
service
sake
and
the
duke
of
york
and
will
propound
it
to
the
duke
of
york
and
i
confess
if
there
be
one
i
would
be
glad
to
be
in
in
the
evening
to
white
hall
and
there
did
without
much
trouble
get
into
the
playhouse
finding
a
good
place
among
the
ladies
of
honour
and
all
of
us
sitting
in
the
pit
and
then
by
and
by
came
the
king
and
queene
and
they
began
fair
but
i
like
no
play
here
so
well
as
at
the
common
playhouse
besides
that
my
eyes
being
very
ill
since
last
sunday
and
this
day
i
was
in
mighty
pain
to
defend
myself
now
from
the
light
of
the
candles
after
the
play
done
we
met
with
batelier
and
hewer
and
talbot
pepys
of
impington
ob
aet
suae
and
they
followed
us
in
a
and
we
all
stopped
at
hercules
pillars
and
there
i
did
give
them
the
best
supper
i
could
and
pretty
merry
and
so
home
between
eleven
and
twelve
at
night
to
westminster
abbey
and
there
did
see
all
the
tombs
very
finely
having
one
with
us
alone
there
being
other
company
this
day
to
see
the
tombs
it
being
and
here
we
did
see
by
particular
favour
the
body
of
queen
katherine
of
valois
and
i
had
the
upper
part
of
her
body
in
my
hands
and
i
did
kiss
her
mouth
reflecting
upon
it
that
i
did
kiss
a
queene
and
that
this
was
my
years
old
that
i
did
kiss
a
queene
but
here
this
man
who
seems
to
understand
well
tells
me
that
the
saying
is
not
true
that
she
was
never
buried
for
she
was
buried
only
when
henry
the
seventh
built
his
chapel
she
was
taken
up
and
laid
in
this
wooden
coffin
but
i
did
there
see
that
in
it
the
body
was
buried
in
a
leaden
one
which
remains
under
the
body
to
this
day
to
the
duke
of
york
house
and
there
before
one
but
the
house
infinite
full
where
by
and
by
the
king
and
court
come
it
being
a
new
play
or
an
old
one
new
vamped
by
shadwell
called
the
royall
shepherdesse
a
altered
by
thomas
shadwell
from
a
comedy
written
by
fountain
called
the
rewards
of
virtue
but
the
silliest
for
words
and
design
and
every
thing
that
ever
i
saw
in
my
whole
life
there
being
nothing
in
the
world
pleasing
in
it
but
a
good
martiall
dance
of
pikemen
where
harris
and
another
do
handle
their
pikes
in
a
dance
to
admiration
but
never
less
satisfied
with
a
play
in
my
life
to
the
king
playhouse
and
saw
the
faithfull
shepherdesse
but
lord
what
an
empty
house
there
not
being
as
i
could
tell
the
people
so
many
as
to
make
up
above
in
the
whole
house
but
i
plainly
discern
the
musick
is
the
better
by
how
much
the
house
the
emptier
march
i
do
hear
that
my
lady
paulina
montagu
did
die
yesterday
at
which
i
went
to
my
lord
lodgings
but
he
is
shut
up
with
sorrow
and
so
not
to
be
spoken
with
and
therefore
i
returned
and
to
westminster
hall
where
i
have
not
been
i
think
in
some
months
and
here
the
hall
was
very
full
the
king
having
by
commission
to
some
lords
this
day
prorogued
the
parliament
till
the
of
october
next
at
which
i
am
glad
hoping
to
have
time
to
go
over
to
france
this
year
but
i
was
most
of
all
surprised
this
morning
by
my
lord
bellasses
who
by
appointment
met
me
at
auditor
wood
at
the
temple
and
tells
me
of
a
duell
designed
between
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
my
lord
halifax
or
sir
coventry
the
challenge
being
carried
by
harry
saville
but
prevented
by
my
lord
arlington
and
the
king
told
of
it
and
this
was
all
the
discourse
at
court
this
day
but
i
meeting
sir
coventry
in
the
duke
of
york
chamber
he
would
not
own
it
to
me
but
told
me
he
was
a
man
of
too
much
peace
to
meddle
with
fighting
and
so
it
rested
but
the
talk
is
full
in
the
town
of
the
business
thence
having
walked
some
turns
with
my
cosen
pepys
and
most
people
by
their
discourse
believing
that
this
parliament
will
never
sit
more
i
away
i
did
bring
home
a
piece
of
my
face
cast
in
plaister
for
to
make
a
visard
upon
for
my
eyes
my
wife
this
day
put
on
first
her
french
gown
called
a
sac
which
becomes
her
very
well
to
white
hall
where
hewer
met
me
and
he
and
i
took
a
turn
in
james
park
and
in
the
mall
did
meet
sir
coventry
and
sir
duncomb
and
did
speak
with
them
about
some
business
before
the
lords
of
the
treasury
but
i
did
find
them
more
than
usually
busy
though
i
knew
not
then
the
reason
of
it
though
i
guessed
it
by
what
followed
next
day
thence
to
dancre
the
painter
and
there
saw
my
picture
of
greenwich
finished
to
my
very
good
content
though
this
manner
of
distemper
do
make
the
figures
not
so
pleasing
as
in
oyle
to
the
duke
of
york
playhouse
and
there
saw
an
old
play
the
first
time
acted
these
forty
years
called
the
lady
tryall
a
tragedy
by
john
ford
acted
only
by
the
young
people
of
the
house
but
the
house
very
full
to
the
new
exchange
and
so
called
at
my
cousin
turner
and
there
meeting
bellwood
did
hear
how
my
lord
mayor
being
invited
this
day
to
dinner
at
the
reader
at
the
temple
and
endeavoring
to
carry
his
sword
up
the
students
did
pull
it
down
and
forced
him
to
go
and
stay
all
the
day
in
a
private
counsellor
chamber
until
the
reader
himself
could
get
the
young
gentlemen
to
dinner
and
then
my
lord
mayor
did
retreat
out
of
the
temple
by
stealth
with
his
sword
up
this
do
make
great
heat
among
the
students
and
my
lord
mayor
did
send
to
the
king
and
also
i
hear
that
sir
richard
browne
did
cause
the
drums
to
beat
for
the
but
all
is
over
only
i
hear
that
the
students
do
resolve
to
try
the
charter
of
the
city
so
we
home
and
betimes
to
bed
and
slept
well
all
night
to
white
hall
where
in
the
first
court
i
did
meet
sir
jeremy
smith
who
did
tell
me
that
sir
coventry
was
just
now
sent
to
the
tower
about
the
business
of
the
challenging
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
so
was
also
harry
saville
to
the
which
as
he
is
a
gentleman
and
of
the
duke
of
bedchamber
i
heard
afterwards
that
the
duke
of
york
is
mightily
incensed
at
and
do
appear
very
high
to
the
king
that
he
might
not
be
sent
thither
but
to
the
tower
this
being
done
only
in
contempt
of
him
this
news
of
sir
coventry
did
strike
me
to
the
heart
and
with
reason
for
by
this
and
my
lord
of
business
i
do
doubt
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
will
be
so
flushed
that
he
will
not
stop
at
any
thing
but
be
forced
to
do
any
thing
now
as
thinking
it
not
safe
to
end
here
and
sir
coventry
being
gone
the
king
will
have
no
good
counsellor
left
nor
the
duke
of
york
any
sure
friend
to
stick
to
him
nor
any
good
man
will
remain
to
advise
what
is
good
this
therefore
do
heartily
trouble
me
as
any
thing
that
ever
i
heard
so
up
into
the
house
and
met
with
several
people
but
the
committee
did
not
meet
and
the
whole
house
i
find
full
of
the
business
of
sir
coventry
and
most
men
very
sensible
of
the
cause
and
effects
of
it
so
meeting
with
my
lord
bellasses
he
told
me
the
particulars
of
this
matter
that
it
arises
about
a
quarrel
which
sir
coventry
had
with
the
duke
of
buckingham
about
a
design
between
him
and
sir
robert
howard
to
bring
him
into
a
play
at
the
king
house
which
coventry
not
enduring
did
by
saville
send
a
letter
to
the
duke
of
buckingham
that
he
had
a
desire
to
speak
with
him
upon
which
the
duke
of
buckingham
did
bid
holmes
his
champion
ever
since
my
lord
shrewsbury
business
go
to
him
to
do
the
business
but
saville
would
not
tell
it
to
any
but
himself
and
therefore
did
go
presently
to
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
told
him
that
his
uncle
coventry
was
a
person
of
honour
and
was
sensible
of
his
grace
liberty
taken
of
abusing
him
and
that
he
had
a
desire
of
satisfaction
and
would
fight
with
him
but
that
here
they
were
interrupted
by
my
lord
chamberlain
coming
in
who
was
commanded
to
go
to
bid
the
duke
of
buckingham
to
come
to
the
king
holmes
having
discovered
it
he
told
me
that
the
king
did
last
night
at
the
council
ask
the
duke
of
buckingham
upon
his
honour
whether
he
received
any
challenge
from
coventry
which
he
confessed
that
he
had
and
then
the
king
asking
coventry
he
told
him
that
he
did
not
owne
what
the
duke
of
buckingham
had
said
though
it
was
not
fit
for
him
to
give
him
a
direct
contradiction
but
being
by
the
king
put
upon
declaring
the
truth
upon
his
honour
be
answered
that
he
had
understood
that
many
hard
questions
had
upon
this
business
been
moved
to
some
lawyers
and
that
therefore
he
was
unwilling
to
declare
any
thing
that
might
from
his
own
mouth
render
him
obnoxious
to
his
majesty
displeasure
and
therefore
prayed
to
be
excused
which
the
king
did
think
fit
to
interpret
to
be
a
confession
and
so
gave
warrant
that
night
for
his
commitment
to
the
tower
being
very
much
troubled
at
this
i
away
by
coach
homewards
and
directly
to
the
tower
where
i
find
him
in
one
bennet
house
son
to
major
bayly
one
of
the
officers
of
the
ordnance
in
the
bricke
tower
where
i
find
him
busy
with
my
lord
halifax
and
his
brother
so
i
would
not
stay
to
interrupt
them
but
only
to
give
him
comfort
and
offer
my
service
to
him
which
he
kindly
and
cheerfully
received
only
owning
his
being
troubled
for
the
king
his
master
displeasure
which
i
suppose
is
the
ordinary
form
and
will
of
persons
in
this
condition
and
so
i
parted
with
great
content
that
i
had
so
earlily
seen
him
there
and
so
going
out
did
meet
sir
jer
smith
going
to
meet
me
who
had
newly
been
with
sir
coventry
and
so
he
and
i
by
water
to
redriffe
and
so
walked
to
deptford
where
i
have
not
been
i
think
these
twelve
months
and
there
to
the
treasurer
house
where
the
duke
of
york
is
and
his
duchesse
and
there
we
find
them
at
dinner
in
the
great

and
there
was
with
them

of

his
good
conduct

and
here
drank
most
excellent
and
great
variety
and
plenty
of
wines
more
than
i
have
drank
at
once
these
seven
years
but
yet
did
me
no
great
hurt
having
dined
very
merrily
and
understanding
by
blancfort
how
angry
the
duke
of
york
was
about
their
offering
to
send
saville
to
the
among
the
rogues
and
then
observing
how
this
company
both
the
ladies
and
all
are
of
a
gang
and
did
drink
a
health
to
the
union
of
the
two
brothers
and
talking
of
others
as
their
enemies
they
parted
and
so
we
up
and
there
i
did
find
the
duke
of
york
and
duchesse
with
all
the
great
ladies
sitting
upon
a
carpet
on
the
ground
there
being
no
chairs
playing
at
i
love
my
love
with
an
a
because
he
is
so
and
so
and
i
hate
him
with
an
a
because
of
this
and
that
and
some
of
them
but
particularly
the
duchesse
herself
and
my
lady
castlemaine
were
very
witty
this
done
they
took
barge
and
i
with
sir
smith
to
captain
cox
and
there
to
talk
and
left
them
after
dinner
i
to
the
tower
where
i
find
sir
coventry
with
abundance
of
company
with
him
and
after
sitting
awhile
and
hearing
some
merry
discourse
and
among
others
of
brouncker
being
this
day
summoned
to
sir
william
morton
made
a
justice
of
the
king
bench
ob
one
of
the
judges
to
give
in
security
for
his
good
behaviour
upon
his
words
the
other
day
to
sir
john
morton
for
weymouth
in
a
at
white
hall
who
had
heretofore
spoke
very
highly
against
brouncker
in
the
house
i
away
and
to
aldgate
before
the
office
i
stepped
to
sir
coventry
at
the
tower
and
there
had
a
great
deal
of
discourse
with
him
among
others
of
the
king
putting
him
out
of
the
council
yesterday
with
which
he
is
well
contented
as
with
what
else
they
can
strip
him
of
he
telling
me
and
so
hath
long
that
he
is
weary
and
surfeited
of
business
but
he
joins
with
me
in
his
fears
that
all
will
go
to
naught
as
matters
are
now
managed
he
told
me
the
matter
of
the
play
that
was
intended
for
his
abuse
wherein
they
foolishly
and
sillily
bring
in
two
tables
like
that
which
he
hath
made
with
a
round
hole
in
the
middle
in
his
closet
to
turn
himself
in
vide
diary
july
where
sir
round
table
is
described
and
he
is
to
be
in
one
of
them
as
master
and
sir
duncomb
in
the
other
as
his
man
or
imitator
and
their
discourse
in
those
tables
about
the
disposing
of
their
books
and
papers
very
foolish
but
that
that
he
is
offended
with
is
his
being
made
so
contemptible
as
that
any
should
dare
to
make
a
gentleman
a
subject
for
the
mirth
of
the
world
and
that
therefore
he
had
told
tom
killigrew
that
he
should
tell
his
actors
whoever
they
were
that
did
offer
at
any
thing
like
representing
him
that
he
would
not
complain
to
my
lord
chamberlain
which
was
too
weak
nor
get
him
beaten
as
sir
charles
sedley
is
said
to
have
done
but
that
he
would
cause
his
nose
to
be
cut
he
told
me
how
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
did
himself
some
time
since
desire
to
join
with
him
of
all
men
in
england
and
did
bid
him
propound
to
himself
to
be
chief
minister
of
state
saying
that
he
would
bring
it
about
but
that
he
refused
to
have
any
thing
to
do
with
any
faction
and
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
did
within
these
few
days
say
that
of
all
men
in
england
he
would
have
chosen
sir
coventry
to
have
joined
entire
with
he
tells
me
that
he
fears
their
prevailing
against
the
duke
of
york
and
that
their
violence
will
force
them
to
it
as
being
already
beyond
his
pardon
he
repeated
to
me
many
examples
of
challengings
of
and
others
but
never
any
proceeded
against
with
that
severity
which
he
is
it
never
amounting
with
others
to
more
than
a
little
confinement
he
tells
me
of
his
being
weary
of
the
treasury
and
of
the
folly
ambition
and
desire
of
popularity
of
sir
thomas
clifford
and
yet
the
rudeness
of
his
tongue
and
passions
when
angry
lord
day
to
the
tower
to
see
sir
coventry
who
had
jermin
and
a
great
many
more
with
him
and
more
while
i
was
there
came
in
so
that
i
do
hear
that
there
was
not
less
than
sixty
coaches
there
yesterday
and
the
other
day
which
i
hear
also
that
there
is
great
exception
taken
at
by
the
king
and
the
duke
of
buckingham
but
it
can
not
be
helped
i
to
white
hall
and
there
hear
that
there
are
letters
come
from
sir
thomas
allen
that
he
hath
made
some
kind
of
peace
with
argier
upon
which
the
king
and
duke
of
york
being
to
go
out
of
town
are
met
at
my
lord
arlington
so
i
there
and
by
wren
was
desired
to
stay
to
see
if
there
were
occasion
for
their
speaking
with
me
which
i
did
walking
without
with
charles
porter
talking
of
a
great
many
things
and
i
perceive
all
the
world
is
against
the
duke
of
buckingham
acting
thus
high
and
do
prophecy
nothing
but
ruin
from
it
but
he
do
well
observe
that
the
church
lands
can
not
certainly
come
to
much
if
the
king
shall
be
persuaded
to
take
them
they
being
leased
out
for
long
leases
by
and
by
after
two
hours
stay
they
rose
having
as
wren
tells
me
resolved
upon
sending
six
ships
to
the
streights
forthwith
not
being
contented
with
the
peace
upon
the
terms
they
demand
which
are
that
all
our
ships
where
any
turks
or
moores
shall
be
found
slaves
shall
be
prizes
which
will
imply
that
they
must
be
searched
i
hear
that
the
king
and
duke
of
york
set
out
for
newmarket
by
three
in
the
morning
to
some
foot
and
races
to
be
abroad
ten
or
twelve
days
so
i
without
seeing
the
duke
of
york
but
wren
showed
me
the
order
of
council
about
the
balancing
accounts
passed
the
council
in
the
very
terms
i
drew
it
only
i
did
put
in
my
name
as
he
that
presented
the
book
of
hosier
preparing
and
that
is
left
out
i
mean
my
name
which
is
no
great
matter
to
white
hall
from
whence
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
went
by
three
in
the
morning
and
had
the
misfortune
to
be
overset
with
the
duke
of
york
the
duke
of
monmouth
and
the
prince
rupert
at
the
king
gate
in
holborne
and
the
king
all
dirty
but
no
hurt
how
it
come
to
pass
i
know
not
but
only
it
was
dark
and
the
torches
did
not
they
say
light
the
coach
as
they
should
do
i
thought
this
morning
to
have
seen
my
lord
sandwich
before
he
went
out
of
town
but
i
came
half
an
hour
too
late
which
troubles
me
i
having
not
seen
him
since
my
lady
pall
died
and
so
to
the
office
to
examine
what
records
i
could
find
there
for
my
help
in
the
great
business
i
am
put
upon
of
defending
the
present
constitution
of
the
navy
but
there
could
not
have
liberty
without
order
from
him
that
is
in
present
waiting
bickerstaffe
who
is
out
of
town
up
and
to
the
tower
and
there
find
sir
coventry
alone
writing
down
his
journall
which
he
tells
me
he
now
keeps
of
the
material
things
upon
which
i
told
him
and
he
is
the
only
man
i
ever
told
it
to
i
think
that
i
kept
it
most
strictly
these
eight
or
ten
years
and
i
am
sorry
almost
that
i
told
it
him
it
not
being
necessary
nor
maybe
convenient
to
have
it
known
here
he
showed
me
the
petition
he
had
sent
to
the
king
by
my
lord
keeper
which
was
not
to
desire
any
admittance
to
employment
but
submitting
himself
therein
humbly
to
his
majesty
but
prayed
the
removal
of
his
displeasure
and
that
he
might
be
set
free
he
tells
me
that
my
lord
keeper
did
acquaint
the
king
with
the
substance
of
it
not
showing
him
the
petition
who
answered
that
he
was
disposing
of
his
employments
and
when
that
was
done
he
might
be
led
to
discharge
him
and
this
is
what
he
expects
and
what
he
seems
to
desire
but
by
this
discourse
he
was
pleased
to
take
occasion
to
show
me
and
read
to
me
his
account
which
he
hath
kept
by
him
under
his
own
hand
of
all
his
discourse
and
the
king
answers
to
him
upon
the
great
business
of
my
lord
clarendon
and
how
he
had
first
moved
the
duke
of
york
with
it
twice
at
good
distance
one
after
another
but
without
success
showing
me
thereby
the
simplicity
and
reasons
of
his
so
doing
and
the
manner
of
it
and
the
king
accepting
it
telling
him
that
he
was
not
satisfied
in
his
management
and
did
discover
some
dissatisfaction
against
him
for
his
opposing
the
laying
aside
of
my
lord
treasurer
at
oxford
which
was
a
secret
the
king
had
not
discovered
and
really
i
was
mighty
proud
to
be
privy
to
this
great
transaction
it
giving
me
great
conviction
of
the
noble
nature
and
ends
of
sir
coventry
in
it
and
considerations
in
general
of
the
consequences
of
great
actions
and
the
uncertainty
of
their
estates
and
other
very
serious
considerations
up
and
to
sir
coventry
to
the
tower
who
tells
me
that
he
hears
that
the
commission
is
gone
down
to
the
king
with
a
blank
to
fill
for
his
place
in
the
treasury
and
he
believes
it
will
be
filled
with
one
of
our
treasurers
of
the
navy
but
which
he
knows
not
but
he
believes
it
will
be
osborne
we
walked
down
to
the
which
is
called
it
seems
my
lord
of
northumberland
walk
being
paved
by
some
one
of
that
title
that
was
prisoner
there
and
at
the
end
of
it
there
is
a
piece
of
iron
upon
the
wall
with
his
arms
upon
it
and
holes
to
put
in
a
peg
for
every
turn
they
make
upon
that
walk
with
great
content
spent
all
the
morning
looking
over
the
navy
accounts
of
several
years
and
the
several
patents
of
the
treasurers
hewer
carried
me
to
nott
the
famous
bookbinder
that
bound
for
my
lord
chancellor
library
and
here
i
did
take
occasion
for
curiosity
to
bespeak
a
book
to
be
bound
only
that
i
might
have
one
of
his
binding
that
which
put
me
in
good
humour
both
at
noon
and
night
is
the
fancy
that
i
am
this
day
made
a
captain
of
one
of
the
king
ships
wren
having
this
day
sent
me
the
duke
of
commission
to
be
captain
of
the
jerzy
in
order
to
my
being
of
a
for
examining
the
loss
of
the
defyance
and
other
things
which
do
give
me
occasion
of
much
mirth
and
may
be
of
some
use
to
me
at
least
i
shall
get
a
little
money
for
the
time
i
have
it
it
being
designed
that
i
must
really
be
a
captain
to
be
able
to
sit
in
this
court
up
and
by
water
with
hewer
to
the
temple
and
thence
to
the
rolls
where
i
made
enquiry
for
several
rolls
and
was
soon
informed
in
the
manner
of
it
and
so
spent
the
whole
morning
with
hewer
he
taking
little
notes
in
short
hand
while
i
hired
a
clerk
there
to
read
to
me
about
twelve
or
more
several
rolls
which
i
did
call
for
and
it
was
great
pleasure
to
me
to
see
the
method
wherein
their
rolls
are
kept
that
when
the
master
of
the
office
one
case
do
call
for
them
who
is
a
man
that
i
have
heretofore
known
by
coming
to
my
lord
sandwich
he
did
most
readily
turn
to
them
at
noon
they
shut
up
and
hewer
and
i
did
walk
to
the
cocke
at
the
end
of
where
i
never
was
a
great
ordinary
mightily
cried
up
and
there
bespoke
a
pullet
which
while
dressing
he
and
i
walked
into
james
park
and
thence
back
and
dined
very
handsome
with
good
soup
and
a
pullet
for
the
whole
thence
back
to
the
rolls
and
did
a
little
more
business
and
so
by
water
to
white
hall
whither
i
went
to
speak
with
williamson
that
if
he
hath
any
papers
relating
to
the
navy
i
might
see
them
which
he
promises
me
and
so
by
water
home
with
great
content
for
what
i
have
this
day
found
having
got
almost
as
much
as
i
desire
of
the
history
of
the
navy
from
to
when
the
king
and
parliament
fell
out
comes
to
me
evelyn
of
deptford
a
worthy
good
man
and
dined
with
me
but
a
bad
dinner
who
is
grieved
for
and
speaks
openly
to
me
his
thoughts
of
the
times
and
our
ruin
approaching
and
all
by
the
folly
of
the
king
his
business
to
me
was
about
some
ground
of
his
at
deptford
next
to
the
king
yard
and
after
dinner
we
parted
to
woolwich
where
i
saw
but
did
not
go
on
board
my
ship
the
jerzy
she
lying
at
the
wharf
under
repair
but
my
business
was
to
speak
with
ackworth
about
some
old
things
and
passages
in
the
navy
for
my
information
therein
in
order
to
my
great
business
now
of
stating
the
history
of
the
navy
this
i
did
and
upon
the
whole
do
find
that
the
late
times
in
all
their
management
were
not
more
husbandly
than
we
and
other
things
of
good
content
to
me
thence
to
greenwich
by
water
and
there
landed
at
the
king
house
which
goes
on
slow
but
is
very
pretty
i
to
the
park
there
to
see
the
prospect
of
the
hill
to
judge
of
dancre
picture
which
he
hath
made
thereof
for
me
and
i
do
like
it
very
well
and
it
is
a
very
pretty
place
thence
to
deptford
but
staid
not
unthwayte
being
out
of
the
way
and
so
home
and
then
to
the
king
tavern
morrice
and
staid
till
hewer
fetched
his
uncle
blackburn
by
appointment
to
me
to
discourse
of
the
business
of
the
navy
in
the
late
times
and
he
did
do
it
by
giving
me
a
most
exact
account
in
writing
of
the
several
turns
in
the
admiralty
and
navy
of
the
persons
employed
therein
from
the
beginning
of
the
leaving
the
parliament
to
his
son
coming
in
to
my
great
content
and
now
i
am
fully
informed
in
all
i
at
present
desire
we
fell
to
other
talk
and
i
find
by
him
that
the
bishops
must
certainly
fall
and
their
hierarchy
these
people
have
got
so
much
ground
upon
the
king
and
kingdom
as
is
not
to
be
got
again
from
them
and
the
bishops
do
well
deserve
it
but
it
is
all
the
talk
i
find
that
wilkins
my
friend
bishop
of
chester
shall
be
removed
to
winchester
and
be
lord
treasurer
though
this
be
foolish
talk
yet
i
do
gather
that
he
is
a
mighty
rising
man
as
being
a
latitudinarian
and
the
duke
of
buckingham
his
great
friend
up
and
to
see
sir
coventry
and
walked
with
him
a
good
while
in
the
and
brave
discourse
about
my
lord
chancellor
and
his
ill
managements
and
mistakes
and
several
things
of
the
navy
sir
thomas
clifford
did
speak
to
me
as
desirous
that
i
would
some
time
come
and
confer
with
him
about
the
navy
which
i
am
glad
of
but
will
take
the
direction
of
the
duke
of
york
before
i
do
it
though
i
would
be
glad
to
do
something
to
secure
myself
if
i
could
in
my
employment
thence
to
the
plaisterer
and
took
my
face
and
my
lord
duke
of
home
with
me
by
coach
they
being
done
to
my
mind
and
mighty
glad
i
am
of
understanding
this
way
of
having
the
pictures
of
any
friends
after
dinner
with
commissioner
middleton
and
kempthorne
to
a
to
which
by
virtue
of
my
late
captainship
i
am
called
the
first
i
was
ever
at
where
many
commanders
and
kempthorne
president
here
was
tried
a
difference
between
sir
van
hemskirke
the
dutch
captain
who
commands
the
nonsuch
built
by
his
direction
and
his
lieutenant
a
drunken
kind
of
silly
business
we
ordered
the
lieutenant
to
ask
him
pardon
and
have
resolved
to
lay
before
the
duke
of
york
what
concerns
the
captain
which
was
striking
of
his
lieutenant
and
challenging
him
to
fight
which
comes
not
within
any
article
of
the
laws
martiall
but
upon
discourse
the
other
day
with
sir
coventry
i
did
advise
middleton
and
he
and
i
did
forbear
to
give
judgment
but
after
the
debate
did
withdraw
into
another
cabin
the
court
being
held
in
one
of
the
yachts
which
was
on
purpose
brought
up
over
against
katherine
it
being
to
be
feared
that
this
precedent
of
our
being
made
captains
in
order
to
the
trying
of
the
loss
of
the
defyance
wherein
we
are
the
proper
persons
to
enquire
into
the
want
of
instructions
while
ships
do
lie
in
harbour
might
be
hereafter
made
of
evil
use
by
putting
the
duke
of
buckingham
or
any
of
these
rude
fellows
that
now
are
uppermost
to
make
packed
courts
by
captains
made
on
purpose
to
serve
their
turns
the
other
cause
was
of
the
loss
of
the
providence
at
tangier
where
the
captain
being
by
chance
on
shore
may
prove
very
inconvenient
to
him
for
example
sake
though
the
man
be
a
good
man
and
one
whom
for
norwood
sake
i
would
be
kind
to
but
i
will
not
offer
any
thing
to
the
excusing
such
a
miscarriage
he
is
at
present
confined
till
he
can
bring
better
proofs
on
his
behalf
of
the
reasons
of
his
being
on
shore
so
middleton
and
i
away
to
the
office
and
there
i
late
busy
making
my
people
as
i
have
done
lately
to
read
discourse
of
the
navy
and
what
other
things
i
can
get
to
inform
me
fully
in
all
and
here
late
about
eight
at
night
comes
wren
to
me
who
had
been
at
the
tower
to
visit
sir
coventry
he
came
only
to
see
how
matters
go
and
tells
me
as
a
secret
that
the
last
night
the
duke
of
york
closet
was
broken
open
and
his
cabinets
and
shut
again
one
of
them
that
the
rogue
that
did
it
hath
left
plate
and
a
watch
behind
him
and
therefore
they
fear
that
it
was
only
for
papers
which
looks
like
a
very
malicious
business
in
design
to
hurt
the
duke
of
york
but
they
can
not
know
that
till
the
duke
of
york
comes
to
town
about
the
papers
and
therefore
make
no
words
of
it
he
gone
i
to
work
again
and
then
to
supper
home
and
to
bed
up
and
to
the
tower
to
sir
coventry
and
there
walked
with
him
alone
on
the
till
company
came
to
him
and
there
about
the
business
of
the
navy
discoursed
with
him
and
about
my
lord
chancellor
and
treasurer
that
they
were
against
the
war
at
first
declaring
as
wise
men
and
statesmen
at
first
to
the
king
that
they
thought
it
fit
to
have
a
war
with
them
at
some
time
or
other
but
that
it
ought
not
to
be
till
we
found
the
crowns
of
spain
and
france
together
by
the
eares
the
want
of
which
did
ruin
our
war
but
then
he
told
me
that
a
great
while
before
the
war
my
lord
chancellor
did
speak
of
a
war
with
some
heat
as
a
thing
to
be
desired
and
did
it
upon
a
belief
that
he
could
with
his
own
speeches
make
the
parliament
give
what
money
he
pleased
and
do
what
he
would
or
would
make
the
king
desire
but
he
found
himself
soon
deceived
of
the
parliament
they
having
a
long
time
before
his
removal
been
cloyed
with
his
speeches
and
good
words
and
being
come
to
hate
him
sir
coventry
did
tell
me
it
as
the
wisest
thing
that
ever
was
said
to
the
king
by
any
statesman
of
his
time
and
it
was
by
my
lord
treasurer
that
is
dead
whom
i
find
he
takes
for
a
very
great
statesman
that
when
the
king
did
show
himself
forward
for
passing
the
act
of
indemnity
he
did
advise
the
king
that
he
would
hold
his
hand
in
doing
it
till
he
had
got
his
power
restored
that
had
been
diminished
by
the
late
times
and
his
revenue
settled
in
such
a
manner
as
he
might
depend
on
himself
without
resting
upon
parliaments
and
then
pass
it
but
my
lord
chancellor
who
thought
he
could
have
the
command
of
parliaments
for
ever
because
for
the
king
sake
they
were
awhile
willing
to
grant
all
the
king
desired
did
press
for
its
being
done
and
so
it
was
and
the
king
from
that
time
able
to
do
nothing
with
the
parliament
almost
mightily
pleased
with
the
news
brought
me
night
that
the
king
and
duke
of
york
are
come
back
this
afternoon
and
no
sooner
come
but
a
warrant
was
sent
to
the
tower
for
the
releasing
sir
coventry
which
do
put
me
in
some
hopes
that
there
may
be
in
this
absence
some
accommodation
made
between
the
duke
of
york
and
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
lord
arlington
to
white
hall
in
a
scull
where
to
the
duke
of
and
there
met
harry
saville
and
do
understand
that
sir
coventry
is
come
to
his
house
last
night
i
understand
by
wren
that
his
friends
having
by
secretary
trevor
and
my
lord
keeper
applied
to
the
king
upon
his
first
coming
home
and
a
promise
made
that
he
should
be
discharged
this
day
my
lord
arlington
did
anticipate
them
by
sending
a
warrant
presently
for
his
discharge
which
looks
a
little
like
kindness
or
a
desire
of
it
which
god
send
though
i
fear
the
contrary
however
my
heart
is
glad
that
he
is
out
thence
up
and
down
the
house
met
may
who
tells
me
the
story
of
his
being
put
by
sir
john
denham
place
of
surveyor
of
the
king
works
who
it
seems
is
lately
dead
by
the
unkindness
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
who
hath
brought
in
wren
though
he
tells
me
he
hath
been
his
servant
for
twenty
years
together
in
all
his
wants
and
dangers
saving
him
from
want
of
bread
by
his
care
and
management
and
with
a
promise
of
having
his
help
in
his
advancement
and
an
engagement
under
his
hand
for
not
yet
paid
and
yet
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
so
ungrateful
as
to
put
him
by
which
is
an
ill
thing
though
wren
is
a
worthy
man
but
he
tells
me
that
the
king
is
kind
to
him
and
hath
promised
him
a
pension
of
a
year
out
of
the
works
which
will
be
of
more
content
to
him
than
the
place
which
under
their
present
wants
of
money
is
a
place
that
disobliges
most
people
being
not
able
to
do
what
they
desire
to
their
lodgings
here
meeting
with
sir
cholmly
and
povy
they
tell
me
that
my
lord
middleton
is
resolved
in
the
caball
that
he
shall
not
go
to
tangier
and
that
sir
edward
harlow
whom
i
know
not
is
propounded
to
go
who
was
governor
of
dunkirke
and
they
say
a
most
worthy
brave
man
which
i
shall
be
very
glad
of
news
lately
come
of
the
algerines
taking
in
money
out
of
one
of
our
company
east
india
ships
which
will
certainly
make
the
war
last
which
i
am
sorry
for
being
so
poor
as
we
are
and
broken
in
pieces
up
and
by
water
with
hewer
to
white
hall
there
to
attend
the
lords
of
the
treasury
but
before
they
sat
i
did
make
a
step
to
see
sir
coventry
at
his
house
where
i
bless
god
he
is
come
again
but
in
my
way
i
met
him
and
so
he
took
me
into
his
coach
and
carried
me
to
white
hall
and
there
set
me
down
where
he
ought
not
at
least
he
hath
not
yet
leave
to
come
nor
hath
thought
fit
yet
to
ask
it
hearing
that
harry
saville
is
not
only
denied
to
kiss
the
king
hand
but
the
king
being
asked
it
by
the
duke
of
york
the
king
did
deny
it
and
directed
that
he
shall
not
receive
him
to
wait
upon
him
in
his
chamber
till
further
orders
sir
coventry
told
me
that
he
was
going
to
visit
sir
john
trevor
who
hath
been
kind
to
him
and
he
showed
me
a
long
list
of
all
his
friends
that
he
must
this
week
make
visits
to
that
came
to
visit
him
in
the
tower
and
seems
mighty
well
satisfied
with
his
being
out
of
business
but
i
hope
he
will
not
long
be
so
at
least
i
do
believe
that
all
must
go
to
rack
if
the
king
do
not
come
to
see
the
want
of
such
a
servant
thence
to
the
and
there
all
the
morning
to
my
great
grief
put
to
do
sir
downing
work
of
dividing
the
customes
for
this
year
between
the
navy
the
ordnance
and
tangier
but
it
did
so
trouble
my
eyes
that
i
had
rather
have
given
than
have
had
it
to
do
but
i
did
thereby
oblige
sir
thomas
clifford
and
sir
duncomb
and
so
am
glad
of
the
opportunity
to
recommend
myself
to
the
former
for
the
latter
i
need
not
he
loving
me
well
already
at
it
till
noon
here
being
several
of
my
brethren
with
me
but
doing
nothing
but
i
all
but
this
day
i
did
also
represent
to
our
treasurers
which
was
read
here
a
state
of
the
charge
of
the
navy
and
what
the
expence
of
it
this
year
would
likely
be
which
is
done
so
as
will
appear
well
done
and
to
my
honour
for
so
the
lords
did
take
it
and
i
oblige
the
treasurers
by
doing
it
at
their
request
i
to
look
over
my
papers
for
the
east
india
company
against
the
afternoon
which
done
i
with
them
to
white
hall
and
there
to
the
where
the
east
india
company
and
three
counsellors
pleaded
against
me
alone
for
three
or
four
hours
till
seven
at
night
before
the
lords
and
the
lords
did
give
me
the
conquest
on
behalf
of
the
king
but
could
not
come
to
any
conclusion
the
company
being
stiff
and
so
i
think
we
shall
go
to
law
with
them
this
done
and
my
eyes
mighty
bad
with
this
day
work
i
to
wren
and
then
up
to
the
duke
of
york
and
there
with
wren
did
propound
to
him
my
going
to
chatham
morrow
with
commissioner
middleton
and
so
this
week
to
make
the
pay
there
and
examine
the
business
of
the
defyance
being
lost
i
took
coach
with
commissioner
middleton
captain
tinker
and
huchinson
and
out
towards
chatham
and
dined
at
dartford
where
we
staid
an
hour
or
two
it
being
a
cold
day
and
so
on
and
got
to
chatham
just
at
night
with
very
good
discourse
by
the
way
but
mostly
of
matters
of
religion
wherein
huchinson
his
vein
lies
to
the
hill
house
and
there
did
give
order
for
a
coach
to
be
made
ready
and
got
gibson
whom
i
carried
with
me
to
go
with
me
and
coney
the
surgeon
towards
maydstone
which
i
had
a
mighty
mind
to
see
a
mighty
cold
and
windy
but
clear
day
and
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
the
medway
running
winding
up
mightily
and
a
very
fine
country
and
i
went
a
little
out
of
the
way
to
have
visited
sir
john
bankes
but
he
at
london
but
here
i
had
a
sight
of
his
seat
and
house
the
friary
in
aylesford
parish
now
the
property
of
the
earl
of
aylesford
whose
ancestor
heneage
finch
married
the
eldest
daughter
and
heiress
of
sir
john
bankes
the
outside
which
is
an
old
abbey
just
like
hinchingbroke
and
as
good
at
least
and
mightily
finely
placed
by
the
river
and
he
keeps
the
grounds
about
it
and
walls
and
the
house
very
handsome
i
was
mightily
pleased
with
the
sight
of
it
thence
to
maydstone
which
i
had
a
mighty
mind
to
see
having
never
been
there
and
walked
all
up
and
down
the
town
and
up
to
the
top
of
the
steeple
and
had
a
noble
view
and
then
down
again
and
in
the
town
did
see
an
old
man
beating
of
flax
and
did
step
into
the
barn
and
give
him
money
and
saw
that
piece
of
husbandry
which
i
never
saw
and
it
is
very
pretty
in
the
street
also
i
did
buy
and
send
to
our
inne
the
bell
a
dish
of
fresh
fish
and
so
having
walked
all
round
the
town
and
found
it
very
pretty
as
most
towns
i
ever
saw
though
not
very
big
and
people
of
good
fashion
in
it
we
to
our
inne
and
had
a
good
dinner
and
a
barber
came
to
me
and
there
trimmed
me
that
i
might
be
clean
against
night
to
go
to
allen
and
so
staying
till
four
we
set
out
i
alone
in
the
coach
going
and
coming
and
in
our
way
back
i
light
out
of
the
way
to
see
a
saxon
monument
as
they
say
of
a
king
which
is
of
three
stones
standing
upright
and
a
great
round
one
lying
on
them
of
great
bigness
although
not
so
big
as
those
on
salisbury
plain
but
certainly
it
is
a
thing
of
great
antiquity
and
i
am
mightily
glad
to
see
it
it
is
near
to
alesford
where
sir
john
bankes
lives
so
homeward
to
chatham
captain
allen
and
there
light
up
and
by
and
by
about
eight
came
kempthorne
and
seven
captains
more
by
the
duke
of
york
order
as
we
expected
to
hold
the
about
the
loss
of
the
defyance
and
so
presently
we
by
boat
to
the
charles
which
lies
upner
castle
and
there
i
did
manage
the
business
the
duke
of
york
having
by
special
order
directed
them
to
take
the
assistance
of
commissioner
middleton
and
me
forasmuch
as
there
might
be
need
of
advice
in
what
relates
to
the
government
of
the
ships
in
harbour
and
so
i
did
lay
the
law
open
to
them
and
rattle
the
out
of
their
wits
almost
and
made
the
trial
last
till
seven
at
night
not
eating
a
bit
all
the
day
only
when
he
had
done
examination
and
i
given
my
thoughts
that
the
neglect
of
the
gunner
of
the
ship
was
as
great
as
i
thought
any
neglect
could
be
which
might
by
the
law
deserve
death
but
commissioner
middleton
did
declare
that
he
was
against
giving
the
sentence
of
death
we
withdrew
as
not
being
of
the
court
and
so
left
them
to
do
what
they
pleased
and
while
they
were
debating
it
the
boatswain
of
the
ship
did
bring
us
out
of
the
kettle
a
piece
of
hot
salt
beef
and
some
brown
bread
and
brandy
and
there
we
did
make
a
little
meal
but
so
good
as
i
never
would
desire
to
eat
better
meat
while
i
live
only
i
would
have
cleaner
dishes
by
and
by
they
had
done
and
called
us
down
from
the
quarterdeck
and
there
we
find
they
do
sentence
that
the
gunner
of
the
defyance
should
stand
upon
the
charles
three
hours
with
his
fault
writ
upon
his
breast
and
with
a
halter
about
his
neck
and
so
be
made
incapable
of
any
service
the
truth
is
the
man
do
seem
and
is
i
believe
a
good
man
but
his
neglect
in
trusting
a
girl
to
carry
fire
into
his
cabin
is
not
to
be
pardoned
this
being
done
we
took
boat
and
home
and
there
a
good
supper
was
ready
for
us
which
should
have
been
our
dinner
the
captains
desirous
to
be
at
london
went
away
presently
for
gravesend
to
get
thither
by
this
tide
and
so
we
to
supper
it
having
been
a
great
snowy
and
mighty
cold
foul
day
and
so
after
supper
to
bed
up
and
with
middleton
all
the
morning
at
the
docke
looking
over
the
and
commissioner
pett
house
in
order
to
captain
cox
coming
to
live
there
in
his
stead
as
commissioner
but
it
is
a
mighty
pretty
house
and
pretty
to
see
how
every
thing
is
said
to
be
out
of
repair
for
this
new
man
though
would
put
it
into
as
good
condition
in
every
thing
as
it
ever
was
in
so
free
every
body
is
of
the
king
money
and
so
to
dinner
at
the
and
after
dinner
till
eight
at
night
close
middleton
and
i
examining
the
business
of
pett
about
selling
a
boat
and
we
find
him
a
very
knave
and
some
other
quarrels
of
his
wherein
to
justify
himself
he
hath
made
complaints
of
others
this
being
done
we
to
supper
and
so
to
talk
commissioner
middleton
being
mighty
good
company
upon
a
journey
and
so
to
bed
we
took
coach
again
and
got
home
about
six
at
night
up
and
by
water
to
white
hall
and
there
to
the
duke
of
york
to
show
myself
after
my
journey
to
chatham
but
did
no
business
with
him
only
after
gone
from
him
i
to
sir
clifford
and
there
after
an
hour
waiting
he
being
alone
in
his
closet
i
did
speak
with
him
and
give
him
the
account
he
gave
me
to
draw
up
and
he
did
like
it
very
well
and
then
fell
to
talk
of
the
business
of
the
navy
and
giving
me
good
words
did
fall
foul
of
the
constitution
and
did
then
discover
his
thoughts
that
sir
minnes
was
too
old
and
so
was
colonell
middleton
and
that
my
lord
brouncker
did
mind
his
mathematics
too
much
i
did
not
give
much
encouragement
to
that
of
finding
fault
with
my
but
did
stand
up
for
the
constitution
and
did
say
that
what
faults
there
were
in
our
office
would
be
found
not
to
arise
from
the
constitution
but
from
the
failures
of
the
officers
in
whose
hands
it
was
this
he
did
seem
to
give
good
ear
to
but
did
give
me
of
myself
very
good
words
which
pleased
me
well
though
i
shall
not
build
upon
them
any
thing
thence
home
and
after
dinner
by
water
with
tom
down
to
greenwich
he
reading
to
me
all
the
way
coming
and
going
my
collections
out
of
the
duke
of
york
old
manuscript
of
the
navy
which
i
have
bound
up
and
do
please
me
mightily
at
greenwich
i
came
to
captain
cocke
where
the
house
full
of
company
at
the
burial
of
james
temple
who
it
seems
hath
been
dead
these
five
days
here
i
had
a
very
good
ring
which
i
did
give
my
wife
as
soon
as
i
came
home
i
spent
my
time
there
walking
in
the
garden
talking
with
james
pierce
who
tells
me
that
he
is
certain
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
had
been
with
his
wenches
all
the
time
that
he
was
absent
which
was
all
the
last
week
nobody
knowing
where
he
was
the
great
talk
is
of
the
king
being
hot
of
late
against
conventicles
and
to
see
whether
the
duke
of
being
returned
will
turn
the
king
which
will
make
him
very
popular
and
some
think
it
is
his
plot
to
make
king
thus
to
show
his
power
in
the
making
him
change
his
mind
but
pierce
did
tell
me
that
the
king
did
certainly
say
that
he
that
took
one
stone
from
the
church
did
take
two
from
his
crown
by
and
by
the
corpse
came
out
and
i
with
sir
richard
browne
and
evelyn
in
their
coach
to
the
church
where
plume
preached
thomas
plume
vicar
of
greenwich
and
installed
archdeacon
of
rochester
ob
up
and
to
sir
coventry
to
see
and
discourse
with
him
and
he
tells
me
that
he
hath
lately
been
with
my
lord
keeper
and
had
much
discourse
about
the
navy
and
particularly
he
tells
me
that
he
finds
they
are
divided
touching
me
and
my
lord
brouncker
some
are
for
removing
and
some
for
keeping
us
he
told
my
lord
keeper
that
it
should
cost
the
king
before
he
had
made
another
as
fit
to
serve
him
in
the
navy
as
i
am
which
though
i
believe
it
is
true
yet
i
am
much
pleased
to
have
that
character
given
me
by
sir
coventry
whatever
be
the
success
of
it
but
i
perceive
they
do
think
that
i
know
too
much
and
shall
impose
upon
whomever
shall
come
next
and
therefore
must
be
removed
though
he
tells
me
that
sir
clifford
is
inclined
well
enough
to
me
and
sir
osborne
by
what
i
have
lately
done
i
suppose
this
news
is
but
what
i
ought
not
to
be
much
troubled
for
considering
my
incapacity
in
regard
to
my
eyes
to
continue
long
at
this
work
up
and
by
water
to
sir
coventry
there
to
talk
with
him
about
business
of
the
navy
and
received
from
him
direction
what
to
advise
the
duke
of
york
at
this
time
which
was
to
submit
and
give
way
to
the
king
naming
a
man
or
two
that
the
people
about
him
have
a
mind
should
be
brought
into
the
navy
and
perhaps
that
may
stop
their
fury
in
running
further
against
the
whole
and
this
he
believes
will
do
it
after
much
discourse
with
him
i
walked
out
with
him
into
james
park
where
being
afraid
to
be
seen
with
him
he
having
not
leave
yet
to
kiss
the
king
hand
but
notice
taken
as
i
hear
of
all
that
go
to
him
i
did
take
the
pretence
of
my
attending
the
tangier
committee
to
take
my
leave
though
to
serve
him
i
should
i
think
stick
at
nothing
at
the
committee
this
morning
my
lord
middleton
declares
at
last
his
being
ready
to
go
as
soon
as
ever
money
can
be
made
ready
to
pay
the
garrison
and
so
i
have
orders
to
get
money
but
how
soon
i
know
not
thence
to
dancre
and
there
saw
our
pictures
which
are
in
doing
and
i
did
choose
a
view
of
rome
instead
of
hampton
court
and
mightily
pleased
i
shall
be
in
them
here
were
sir
charles
cotterell
and
his
son
bespeaking
something
both
ingenious
men
i
hear
thence
my
wife
and
i
to
the
park
and
pretty
store
of
company
and
so
home
with
great
content
and
so
ends
the
month
my
mind
in
pretty
good
content
for
all
things
but
the
designs
on
foot
to
bring
alterations
in
the
office
which
trouble
me
april
up
and
with
colonell
middleton
at
the
desire
of
kempthorne
the
president
for
our
assisting
them
to
the
on
board
a
yacht
in
the
river
here
to
try
the
business
of
the
purser
complaints
baker
against
trevanion
his
commander
of
the
dartmouth
but
lord
to
see
what
wretched
doings
there
were
among
all
the
commanders
to
ruin
the
purser
and
defend
the
captain
in
all
his
rogueries
be
it
to
the
prejudice
of
the
king
or
purser
no
good
man
could
bear
i
confess
i
was
pretty
high
which
the
young
gentlemen
commanders
did
not
like
and
middleton
did
the
same
but
could
not
bring
it
to
any
issue
this
day
sitting
till
two
and
therefore
we
being
sent
for
went
to
sir
pen
by
invitation
to
dine
at
my
cosen
turner
and
there
we
staid
awhile
and
talked
and
particularly
here
we
met
with
ball
the
parson
of
the
temple
who
did
tell
me
a
great
many
pretty
stories
about
the
manner
of
the
parsons
being
paid
for
their
preaching
at
paul
heretofore
and
now
and
the
ground
of
the
lecture
and
heretofore
for
the
names
of
the
founders
thereof
which
were
many
at
some
some
per
annum
towards
it
and
had
their
names
read
in
the
pulpit
every
sermon
among
those
holy
persons
that
the
church
do
order
a
collect
for
giving
god
thanks
for
to
white
hall
and
there
to
the
duke
of
york
lodgings
whither
he
by
and
by
by
his
appointment
came
and
alone
with
him
an
hour
in
his
closet
telling
him
mine
and
sir
advice
touching
the
present
posture
of
the
navy
as
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
the
rest
do
now
labour
to
make
changes
therein
and
that
it
were
best
for
him
to
suffer
the
king
to
be
satisfied
with
the
bringing
in
of
a
man
or
two
whom
they
desire
i
did
also
give
the
duke
of
york
a
short
account
of
the
history
of
the
navy
as
to
our
office
wherewith
he
was
very
well
satisfied
but
i
do
find
that
he
is
pretty
stiff
against
their
bringing
in
of
men
against
his
mind
as
the
treasurers
were
and
particularly
against
child
coming
in
because
he
is
a
merchant
after
much
discourse
with
him
we
parted
and
the
council
sat
while
i
staid
waiting
for
his
telling
me
when
i
should
be
ready
to
give
him
a
written
account
of
the
administration
of
the
navy
which
caused
me
to
wait
the
whole
afternoon
till
night
in
the
mean
time
stepping
to
the
duchesse
of
york
side
to
speak
with
lady
peterborough
i
did
see
the
young
duchesse
a
little
child
in
hanging
sleeves
dance
most
finely
so
as
almost
to
ravish
me
her
ears
were
so
good
taught
by
a
frenchman
that
did
heretofore
teach
the
king
and
all
the
king
children
and
the
mother
herself
who
do
still
dance
well
up
and
to
the
council
of
war
again
with
middleton
but
the
proceedings
of
the
commanders
so
devilishly
bad
and
so
professedly
partial
to
the
captain
that
i
could
endure
it
no
longer
but
took
occasion
to
pretend
business
at
the
office
and
away
and
colonell
middleton
with
me
who
was
of
the
same
mind
and
resolved
to
declare
our
minds
freely
to
the
duke
of
york
about
it
after
dinner
with
sir
minnes
and
middleton
to
white
hall
by
appointment
and
at
my
lord
arlington
the
office
did
attend
the
king
and
caball
to
discourse
of
the
further
quantity
of
victuals
fit
to
be
declared
for
which
was
men
for
six
months
and
so
without
more
ado
or
stay
there
hearing
no
news
but
that
sir
thomas
allen
is
to
be
expected
every
hour
at
home
with
his
fleet
or
news
of
his
being
gone
back
to
algier
the
hath
been
of
late
mighty
ill
and
some
fears
of
her
death
went
five
or
six
miles
towards
branford
where
the
prince
of
tuscany
cosmo
de
medici
who
succeeded
his
father
ferdinand
in
the
dukedom
of
tuscany
his
tour
in
england
has
been
recently
published
who
comes
into
england
only
to
spend
money
and
see
our
country
comes
into
the
town
and
is
much
expected
and
we
met
him
but
the
coach
passing
by
apace
we
could
not
see
much
of
him
but
he
seems
a
very
jolly
and
good
comely
man
middleton
and
i
did
in
plain
terms
acquaint
the
duke
of
york
what
we
thought
and
had
observed
in
the
late
which
the
duke
of
york
did
give
ear
to
and
though
he
thinks
not
fit
to
revoke
what
is
already
done
in
this
case
by
a
martiall
yet
it
shall
bring
forth
some
good
laws
in
the
behaviour
of
captains
to
their
for
the
time
to
come
to
the
lords
of
the
treasury
where
all
the
morning
and
settled
matters
to
their
liking
about
the
assignments
on
the
customes
between
the
and
victualler
and
to
that
end
spent
most
of
the
morning
there
with
gauden
i
to
the
and
there
heard
the
great
complaint
of
the
city
tried
against
the
gentlemen
of
the
temple
for
the
late
riot
as
they
would
have
it
when
my
lord
mayor
was
there
but
upon
hearing
the
whole
business
the
city
was
certainly
to
blame
to
charge
them
in
this
manner
as
with
a
riot
but
the
king
and
council
did
forbear
to
determine
any
thing
in
it
till
the
other
business
of
the
title
and
privilege
be
decided
which
is
now
under
dispute
at
law
between
them
whether
the
temple
be
within
the
liberty
of
the
city
or
no
but
i
was
sorry
to
see
the
city
so
ill
advised
as
to
complain
in
a
thing
where
their
proofs
were
so
weak
up
and
to
white
hall
to
the
king
side
to
find
sir
clifford
where
the
duke
of
york
came
and
found
me
which
i
was
sorry
for
for
fear
he
should
think
i
was
making
friends
on
that
side
but
i
did
put
it
off
the
best
i
could
my
being
there
and
so
by
and
by
had
opportunity
alone
to
show
sir
clifford
the
fair
account
i
had
drawn
up
of
the
customes
which
he
liked
and
seemed
mightily
pleased
with
me
and
so
away
to
the
office
to
do
a
little
business
there
and
so
to
the
office
where
all
the
morning
up
and
by
water
to
white
hall
and
there
with
the
board
attended
the
duke
of
york
and
sir
thomas
allen
with
us
who
came
to
town
yesterday
and
it
is
resolved
another
fleet
shall
go
to
the
streights
forthwith
and
he
command
it
but
his
coming
home
is
mighty
hardly
talked
on
by
the
merchants
for
leaving
their
ships
there
to
the
mercy
of
the
turks
but
of
this
more
in
my
to
the
and
to
several
places
among
others
to
faythorne
to
have
seen
an
instrument
which
he
was
said
to
have
of
drawing
perspectives
but
he
had
it
not
but
here
i
did
see
his
work
house
and
the
best
things
of
his
doing
he
had
by
him
after
dinner
comes
seamour
to
visit
me
a
talking
fellow
but
i
hear
by
him
that
captain
trevanion
do
give
it
out
every
where
that
i
did
the
whole
against
him
so
long
as
i
was
there
and
perhaps
i
may
receive
at
this
time
some
wrong
by
it
but
i
care
not
for
what
i
did
was
out
of
my
desire
to
do
justice
to
loton
the
a
dutchman
living
in
james
market
but
there
saw
no
good
pictures
but
by
accident
he
did
direct
us
to
a
painter
that
was
then
in
the
house
with
him
a
dutchman
newly
come
over
one
evereest
probably
simon
varelst
a
dutch
who
practised
his
art
with
much
success
in
england
about
this
time
who
took
us
to
his
lodging
close
by
and
did
show
us
a
little
of
his
drawing
the
finest
thing
that
ever
i
think
i
saw
in
my
life
the
drops
of
dew
hanging
on
the
leaves
so
as
i
was
forced
again
and
again
to
put
my
finger
to
it
to
feel
whether
my
eyes
were
deceived
or
no
he
do
ask
for
it
i
had
the
vanity
to
bid
him
but
a
better
picture
i
never
saw
in
my
whole
life
and
it
is
worth
going
twenty
miles
to
see
it
thence
leaving
balty
there
i
took
my
wife
to
james
and
there
carried
her
to
the
queene
chapel
the
first
time
i
ever
did
it
and
heard
excellent
musick
but
not
so
good
as
by
accident
i
did
hear
there
yesterday
as
i
went
through
the
park
from
white
hall
to
see
sir
coventry
which
i
have
forgot
to
set
down
in
my
journal
yesterday
and
going
out
of
the
chapel
i
did
see
the
prince
of
tuscany
come
out
a
comely
black
fat
man
in
a
and
my
wife
and
i
did
see
him
this
afternoon
through
a
window
in
this
chapel
all
that
sir
coventry
yesterday
did
tell
me
new
was
that
the
king
would
not
yet
give
him
leave
to
come
to
kiss
his
hand
and
he
do
believe
that
he
will
not
in
a
great
while
do
it
till
those
about
him
shall
see
fit
which
i
am
sorry
for
thence
to
the
park
my
wife
and
i
and
here
sir
coventry
did
first
see
me
and
my
wife
in
a
coach
of
our
own
and
so
did
also
this
night
the
duke
of
york
who
did
eye
my
wife
mightily
but
i
begin
to
doubt
that
my
being
so
much
seen
in
my
own
coach
at
this
time
may
be
observed
to
my
prejudice
but
i
must
venture
it
now
so
home
and
so
set
down
my
journal
with
the
help
of
my
left
eye
through
my
tube
for
fourteen
days
past
which
is
so
much
as
i
hope
i
shall
not
run
in
arrear
again
but
the
badness
of
my
eyes
do
force
me
to
it
the
whole
office
attended
the
duke
of
york
at
his
meeting
with
sir
thomas
allen
and
several
to
consider
of
the
manner
of
managing
the
war
with
algier
and
it
being
a
thing
i
was
wholly
silent
in
i
did
only
observe
and
find
that
their
manner
of
discourse
on
this
weighty
affair
was
very
mean
and
disorderly
the
duke
of
york
himself
being
the
man
that
i
thought
spoke
most
to
the
purpose
by
water
to
the
and
there
happened
to
sit
by
sir
fretcheville
hollis
who
is
still
full
of
his
and
prophane
talk
here
we
saw
a
prize
fought
between
a
soldier
and
a
one
warrel
who
promised
the
least
in
his
looks
and
performed
the
most
of
valour
in
his
boldness
and
evenness
of
mind
and
smiles
in
all
he
did
that
ever
i
saw
and
we
were
all
both
deceived
and
infinitely
taken
with
him
he
did
soundly
beat
the
soldier
and
cut
him
over
the
head
thence
back
to
white
hall
mightily
pleased
all
of
us
with
this
sight
and
particularly
this
fellow
as
a
most
extraordinary
man
for
his
temper
and
evenness
in
fighting
this
evening
coming
home
we
overtook
alderman
backewell
coach
and
his
lady
and
followed
them
to
their
house
and
there
made
them
the
first
visit
where
they
received
us
with
extraordinary
civility
and
owning
the
obligation
but
i
do
contrary
to
my
expectation
find
her
something
a
proud
and
woman
in
telling
the
number
of
her
servants
and
family
and
expences
he
is
also
so
but
he
was
ever
of
that
strain
but
here
he
showed
me
the
model
of
his
houses
that
he
is
going
to
build
in
cornhill
and
but
he
hath
purchased
so
much
there
that
it
looks
like
a
little
town
and
must
have
cost
him
a
great
deal
of
money
i
by
to
the
spittle
and
heard
a
piece
of
a
dull
sermon
to
my
lord
mayor
and
aldermen
and
thence
saw
them
all
take
horse
and
ride
away
which
i
have
not
seen
together
many
a
day
their
wives
also
went
in
their
coaches
and
indeed
the
sight
was
mighty
pleasing
thence
took
occasion
to
go
back
to
a
milliner
in
whose
name
i
understand
to
be
clerke
and
there
her
husband
inviting
me
up
to
the
balcony
to
see
the
show
go
by
to
dinner
at
i
did
go
up
and
there
saw
it
go
by
to
the
duke
of
yorks
playhouse
and
there
saw
the
impertinents
a
play
which
pleases
me
well
still
but
it
is
with
great
trouble
that
i
now
see
a
play
because
of
my
eyes
the
light
of
the
candles
making
it
very
troublesome
to
me
after
the
play
to
creed
they
do
here
talk
mightily
of
my
lady
paulina
making
a
very
good
end
and
being
mightily
religious
in
her
and
she
hath
left
many
good
notes
of
sermons
and
religion
wrote
with
her
own
hand
which
nobody
ever
knew
of
which
i
am
glad
of
but
she
was
always
a
peevish
lady
to
sir
coventry
reading
over
first
my
draught
of
the
administration
of
the
navy
which
he
do
like
very
well
and
so
fell
to
talk
of
his
late
disgrace
and
how
basely
and
in
what
a
mean
manner
the
duke
of
buckingham
hath
proceeded
against
him
not
like
a
man
of
honour
he
tells
me
that
the
king
will
not
give
other
answer
about
his
coming
to
kiss
his
hands
than
not
yet
but
he
says
that
this
that
he
desires
of
kissing
the
king
hand
is
only
to
show
to
the
world
that
he
is
not
a
discontent
and
not
in
any
desire
to
come
again
into
play
though
i
do
perceive
that
he
speaks
this
with
less
earnestness
than
heretofore
and
this
it
may
be
is
from
what
he
told
me
lately
that
the
king
is
offended
at
what
is
talked
that
he
hath
declared
himself
desirous
not
to
have
to
do
with
any
employment
more
but
he
do
tell
me
that
the
leisure
he
hath
yet
had
do
not
at
all
begin
to
be
burden
some
to
him
he
knowing
how
to
spend
his
time
with
content
to
himself
and
that
he
hopes
shortly
to
contract
his
expence
so
as
that
he
shall
not
be
under
any
straits
in
that
respect
neither
and
so
seems
to
be
in
very
good
condition
of
content
thence
i
away
over
the
park
it
being
now
night
to
white
hall
and
there
in
the
duchesse
chamber
do
find
the
duke
of
york
and
upon
my
offer
to
speak
with
him
he
did
come
to
me
and
withdrew
to
his
closet
and
there
did
hear
and
approve
my
paper
of
the
administration
of
the
navy
only
did
bid
me
alter
these
words
upon
the
rupture
between
the
late
king
and
the
parliament
to
these
the
beginning
of
the
late
rebellion
giving
it
me
as
but
reason
to
show
that
it
was
with
the
rebellion
that
the
navy
was
put
by
out
of
its
old
good
course
into
that
of
a
commission
having
done
this
we
fell
to
other
talk
he
with
great
confidence
telling
me
how
matters
go
among
our
adversaries
in
reference
to
the
navy
and
that
he
thinks
they
do
begin
to
flag
but
then
beginning
to
talk
in
general
of
the
excellency
of
old
constitutions
he
did
bring
out
of
his
cabinet
and
made
me
read
it
an
extract
out
of
a
book
of
my
late
lord
of
northumberland
so
prophetic
of
the
business
of
chatham
as
is
almost
miraculous
i
did
desire
and
he
did
give
it
me
to
copy
out
which
pleased
me
mightily
to
my
office
again
to
examine
the
fair
draught
and
so
borrowing
sir
minnes
coach
he
going
with
colonell
middleton
i
to
white
hall
where
we
all
met
and
did
sign
it
and
then
to
my
lord
arlington
where
the
king
and
the
duke
of
york
and
prince
rupert
as
also
ormond
and
the
two
secretaries
with
my
lord
ashly
and
sir
clifford
were
and
there
by
and
by
being
called
in
williamson
did
read
over
our
paper
which
was
in
a
letter
to
the
duke
of
york
bound
up
in
a
book
with
the
duke
of
york
book
of
instructions
he
read
it
well
and
after
read
we
were
bid
to
withdraw
nothing
being
at
all
said
to
it
and
by
and
by
we
were
called
in
again
and
nothing
said
to
that
business
but
another
begun
about
the
state
of
this
year
action
and
our
wants
of
money
as
i
had
stated
the
same
lately
to
our
treasurers
which
i
was
bid
and
did
largely
and
with
great
content
open
and
having
so
done
we
all
withdrew
and
left
them
to
debate
our
supply
of
money
to
which
being
called
in
and
referred
to
attend
on
the
lords
of
the
treasury
we
all
departed
and
i
only
staid
in
the
house
till
the
council
rose
and
then
to
the
duke
of
york
in
the
duchesse
chamber
where
he
told
me
that
the
book
was
there
left
with
my
lord
arlington
for
any
of
the
lords
to
view
that
had
a
mind
and
to
prepare
and
present
to
the
king
what
they
had
to
say
in
writing
to
any
part
of
it
which
is
all
we
can
desire
and
so
that
rested
the
duke
of
york
then
went
to
other
talk
and
by
and
by
comes
the
prince
of
tuscany
to
visit
him
and
the
duchesse
and
find
that
he
do
still
remain
incognito
and
so
intends
to
do
all
the
time
he
stays
here
for
avoiding
trouble
to
the
king
and
himself
and
expence
also
to
both
at
noon
comes
my
guest
hugh
may
and
with
him
sir
henry
capell
my
old
lord
capell
son
and
parker
and
i
had
a
pretty
dinner
for
them
and
both
before
and
after
dinner
had
excellent
discourse
and
showed
them
my
closet
and
my
office
and
the
method
of
it
to
their
great
content
and
more
extraordinary
manly
discourse
and
opportunity
of
showing
myself
and
learning
from
others
i
have
not
in
ordinary
discourse
had
in
my
life
they
being
all
persons
of
worth
but
especially
sir
capell
whose
being
a
and
hearing
my
discourse
in
the
hath
as
may
tells
me
given
him
a
long
desire
to
know
and
discourse
with
me
in
the
afternoon
we
walked
to
the
old
near
the
spitalfields
where
i
never
was
before
but
now
by
captain
deane
invitation
did
go
to
see
his
new
gun
tryed
this
being
the
place
where
the
officers
of
the
ordnance
do
try
all
their
great
guns
and
when
we
came
did
find
that
the
trial
had
been
made
and
they
going
away
with
extraordinary
report
of
the
proof
of
his
gun
which
from
the
shortness
and
bigness
they
do
call
punchinello
but
i
desired
colonell
legg
to
stay
and
give
us
a
sight
of
her
performance
which
he
did
and
there
in
short
against
a
gun
more
than
as
long
and
as
heavy
again
and
charged
with
as
much
powder
again
she
carried
the
same
bullet
as
strong
to
the
mark
and
nearer
and
above
the
mark
at
a
point
blank
than
theirs
and
is
more
easily
managed
and
recoyles
no
more
than
that
which
is
a
thing
so
extraordinary
as
to
be
admired
for
the
happiness
of
his
invention
and
to
the
great
regret
of
the
old
gunners
and
officers
of
the
ordnance
that
were
there
only
colonell
legg
did
do
her
much
right
in
his
report
of
her
and
so
having
seen
this
great
and
first
experiment
we
all
parted
i
seeing
my
guests
into
a
and
myself
with
captain
deane
taking
a
did
go
out
towards
bow
and
went
as
far
as
stratford
and
all
the
way
talking
of
this
invention
and
he
offering
me
a
third
of
the
profit
of
it
which
for
aught
i
know
or
do
at
present
think
may
prove
matter
considerable
to
us
for
either
the
king
will
give
him
a
reward
for
it
if
he
keeps
it
to
himself
or
he
will
give
us
a
patent
to
make
our
profit
of
it
and
no
doubt
but
it
will
be
of
profit
to
merchantmen
and
others
to
have
guns
of
the
same
force
at
half
the
charge
this
was
our
talk
and
then
to
talk
of
other
things
of
the
navy
in
general
and
among
other
things
he
did
tell
me
that
he
do
hear
how
the
duke
of
buckingham
hath
a
spite
at
me
which
i
knew
before
but
value
it
not
and
he
tells
me
that
sir
allen
is
not
my
friend
but
for
all
this
i
am
not
much
troubled
for
i
know
myself
so
usefull
that
as
i
believe
they
will
not
part
with
me
so
i
thank
god
my
condition
is
such
that
i
can
retire
and
be
able
to
live
with
comfort
though
not
with
abundance
to
auditor
wood
and
met
my
lord
bellasses
upon
some
business
of
his
accounts
attended
the
duke
of
york
a
little
being
the
first
time
of
my
waiting
on
him
at
james
this
summer
whither
he
is
now
newly
gone
and
thence
walked
to
white
hall
and
so
by
and
by
to
the
and
heard
a
remarkable
cause
pleaded
between
the
farmers
of
the
excise
of
wiltshire
in
complaint
against
the
justices
of
peace
of
salisbury
and
sir
finch
was
for
the
former
but
lord
to
see
how
he
did
with
his
admirable
eloquence
order
the
matter
is
not
to
be
conceived
almost
so
pleasant
a
thing
it
is
to
hear
him
plead
after
dinner
by
water
to
white
hall
where
the
duke
of
york
did
meet
our
office
and
went
with
us
to
the
lords
commissioners
of
the
treasury
and
there
we
did
go
over
all
the
business
of
the
state
i
had
drawn
up
of
this
year
action
and
expence
which
i
did
do
to
their
satisfaction
and
convincing
them
of
the
necessity
of
providing
more
money
if
possible
for
us
thence
the
duke
of
york
being
gone
i
did
there
stay
walking
with
sir
cholmly
in
the
court
talking
of
news
where
he
told
me
that
now
the
great
design
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
to
prevent
the
meeting
since
he
can
not
bring
about
with
the
king
the
dissolving
of
this
parliament
that
the
king
may
not
need
it
and
therefore
my
lord
alban
is
hourly
expected
with
great
offers
of
a
million
of
money
to
buy
our
breach
with
the
dutch
and
this
they
do
think
may
tempt
the
king
to
take
the
money
and
thereby
be
out
of
a
necessity
of
calling
the
parliament
again
which
these
people
dare
not
suffer
to
meet
again
but
this
he
doubts
and
so
do
i
that
it
will
be
the
ruin
of
the
nation
if
we
fall
out
with
holland
up
and
to
the
office
where
all
the
morning
at
noon
home
to
dinner
and
captain
deane
with
us
and
very
good
discourse
and
particularly
about
my
getting
a
book
for
him
to
draw
up
his
whole
theory
of
shipping
which
at
my
desire
he
hath
gone
far
in
and
hath
shown
me
what
he
hath
done
therein
to
admiration
i
did
give
him
a
parallelogram
which
he
is
mightily
taken
with
and
so
after
dinner
to
the
office
where
all
the
afternoon
till
night
late
and
then
home
to
the
and
heard
two
or
three
causes
among
others
that
of
the
complaint
of
sir
philip
howard
and
watson
the
inventors
as
they
pretend
of
the
business
of
varnishing
and
against
the
company
of
painters
who
take
upon
them
to
do
the
same
thing
where
i
saw
a
great
instance
of
the
weakness
of
a
young
counsel
they
used
to
such
an
audience
against
the
and
two
more
able
counsel
used
to
it
though
he
had
the
right
of
his
side
and
did
prevail
for
what
he
pretended
to
against
the
rest
yet
it
was
with
much
disadvantage
and
hazard
here
i
also
heard
papillion
make
his
defence
to
the
king
against
some
complaints
of
the
farmers
of
excise
but
it
was
so
weak
and
done
only
by
his
own
seeking
that
it
was
to
his
injury
more
than
profit
and
made
his
case
the
worse
being
and
in
a
cause
against
the
king
lord
day
up
and
to
my
office
awhile
and
thither
comes
lead
with
my
vizard
with
a
tube
fastened
within
both
eyes
which
with
the
help
which
he
prompts
me
to
of
a
glass
in
the
tube
do
content
me
mightily
how
came
and
dined
with
us
and
then
i
to
my
office
he
being
gone
to
write
down
my
journal
for
the
last
twelve
days
and
did
it
with
the
help
of
my
vizard
and
tube
fixed
to
it
and
do
find
it
mighty
manageable
but
how
helpfull
to
my
eyes
this
trial
will
show
me
so
abroad
with
my
wife
in
the
afternoon
to
the
park
where
very
much
company
and
the
weather
very
pleasant
i
carried
my
wife
to
the
lodge
the
first
time
this
year
and
there
in
our
coach
eat
a
cheesecake
and
drank
a
tankard
of
milk
i
showed
her
this
day
also
first
the
prince
of
tuscany
who
was
in
the
park
and
many
very
fine
ladies
after
dinner
comes
colonell
macknachan
one
that
i
see
often
at
court
a
scotchman
but
know
him
not
only
he
brings
me
a
letter
from
my
lord
middleton
who
he
says
is
in
great
distress
for
to
relieve
my
lord
morton
william
ninth
earl
of
morton
who
had
married
lord
middleton
daughter
grizel
with
but
upon
what
account
i
know
not
and
he
would
have
me
advance
it
without
order
upon
his
pay
for
tangier
which
i
was
astonished
at
but
had
the
grace
to
deny
him
with
an
excuse
and
so
he
went
away
leaving
me
a
little
troubled
that
i
was
thus
driven
on
a
sudden
to
do
any
thing
herein
but
creed
coming
just
now
to
see
me
be
approves
of
what
i
have
done
a
great
fire
happened
in
last
night
burning
the
house
of
one
lady
hungerford
who
was
to
come
to
town
to
it
this
night
and
so
the
house
is
burned
new
furnished
by
carelessness
of
the
girl
sent
to
take
off
a
candle
from
a
bunch
of
candles
which
she
did
by
burning
it
off
and
left
the
rest
as
is
supposed
on
fire
the
king
and
court
were
here
it
seems
and
stopped
the
fire
by
blowing
up
of
the
next
house
the
king
and
court
went
out
of
town
to
newmarket
this
morning
betimes
for
a
week
up
and
was
called
upon
by
sir
cholmly
to
discourse
about
some
accounts
of
his
of
tangier
and
then
to
other
talk
and
i
find
by
him
that
it
is
brought
almost
to
effect
the
late
endeavours
of
the
duke
of
york
and
duchesse
the
and
my
lord
alban
together
with
some
of
the
contrary
faction
as
my
lord
arlington
that
for
a
sum
of
money
we
shall
enter
into
a
league
with
the
king
of
france
wherein
he
says
my
lord
chancellor
is
also
concerned
and
that
he
believes
that
in
the
doing
hereof
it
is
meant
that
he
shall
come
in
again
and
that
this
sum
of
money
will
so
help
the
king
as
that
he
will
not
need
the
parliament
and
that
in
that
regard
it
will
be
forwarded
by
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
his
faction
who
dread
the
parliament
but
hereby
must
leave
the
dutch
and
that
i
doubt
will
undo
us
and
sir
cholmly
says
he
finds
coventry
do
think
the
like
my
lady
castlemaine
is
instrumental
in
this
matter
and
he
says
never
more
great
with
the
king
than
she
is
now
but
this
is
a
thing
that
will
make
the
parliament
and
kingdom
mad
and
will
turn
to
our
ruine
for
with
this
money
the
king
shall
wanton
away
his
time
in
pleasures
and
think
nothing
of
the
main
till
it
be
too
late
this
morning
sheres
sent
me
in
two
volumes
marian
his
history
of
spaine
in
spanish
an
excellent
book
and
i
am
much
obliged
to
him
for
it
up
and
by
coach
to
the
coachmaker
and
there
i
do
find
a
great
many
ladies
sitting
in
the
body
of
a
coach
that
must
be
ended
by
they
were
my
lady
marquess
of
winchester
isabella
daughter
of
william
viscount
stafford
third
wife
to
james
fifth
marquis
of
winchester
bellasses
john
lord
bellassis
was
thrice
married
first
to
jane
daughter
of
sir
robert
boteler
of
woodhall
knt
secondly
to
ann
daughter
of
sir
robert
crane
of
chilton
suffolk
thirdly
to
lady
anne
powlet
daughter
of
john
fourth
marquis
of
winchester
the
lady
here
mentioned
was
the
second
or
third
wife
probably
the
latter
and
other
great
ladies
eating
of
bread
and
butter
and
drinking
ale
i
to
my
coach
which
is
silvered
over
but
no
varnish
yet
laid
on
so
i
put
it
in
a
way
of
doing
and
my
self
about
other
business
and
particularly
to
see
sir
coventry
with
whom
i
talked
a
good
while
to
my
great
content
and
so
to
other
places
among
others
to
my
tailor
and
then
to
the
where
my
belt
cost
me
of
the
colour
of
my
new
suit
and
here
understanding
that
the
mistress
of
the
house
an
oldish
woman
in
a
hat
hath
some
water
good
for
the
eyes
she
did
dress
me
making
my
eyes
smart
most
horribly
and
did
give
me
a
little
glass
of
it
which
i
will
use
and
hope
it
will
do
me
good
so
to
the
cutler
and
there
did
give
tom
who
was
with
me
all
day
a
sword
cost
me
and
a
belt
of
my
owne
and
sent
my
own
sword
agilding
against
this
morning
i
did
visit
oldenburgh
and
did
see
the
instrument
for
perspective
made
by
wren
of
which
i
have
one
making
by
browne
and
the
sight
of
this
do
please
me
mightily
at
noon
my
wife
came
to
me
at
my
tailor
and
i
sent
her
home
and
myself
and
tom
dined
at
hercules
pillars
and
so
about
our
business
again
and
particularly
to
lilly
the
varnisher
about
my
prints
whereof
some
of
them
are
pasted
upon
the
boards
and
to
my
full
content
thence
to
the
one
norris
in
long
acre
who
showed
me
several
forms
of
frames
which
were
pretty
in
little
bits
of
mouldings
to
choose
patterns
by
this
done
i
to
my
coachmaker
and
there
vexed
to
see
nothing
yet
done
to
my
coach
at
three
in
the
afternoon
but
i
set
it
in
doing
and
stood
by
till
eight
at
night
and
saw
the
painter
varnish
it
which
is
pretty
to
see
how
every
doing
it
over
do
make
it
more
and
more
yellow
and
it
dries
as
fast
in
the
sun
as
it
can
be
laid
on
almost
and
most
coaches
are
done
so
and
it
is
very
pretty
when
laid
on
well
and
not
too
pale
as
some
are
even
to
show
the
silver
here
i
did
make
the
workmen
drink
and
saw
my
coach
cleaned
and
oyled
and
staying
among
poor
people
there
in
the
ally
did
hear
them
call
their
fat
child
punch
which
pleased
me
mightily
that
word
being
become
a
word
of
common
use
for
all
that
is
thick
and
short
may
up
betimes
my
wife
extraordinary
fine
with
her
flowered
tabby
gown
that
she
made
two
years
ago
now
laced
exceeding
pretty
and
indeed
was
fine
all
over
and
mighty
earnest
to
go
though
the
day
was
very
lowering
and
she
would
have
me
put
on
my
fine
suit
which
i
did
and
so
anon
we
went
alone
through
the
town
with
our
new
liveries
of
serge
and
the
horses
manes
and
tails
tied
with
red
ribbons
and
the
standards
thus
gilt
with
varnish
and
all
clean
and
green
reines
that
people
did
mightily
look
upon
us
and
the
truth
is
i
did
not
see
any
coach
more
pretty
though
more
gay
than
ours
all
the
day
the
day
being
unpleasing
though
the
park
full
of
coaches
but
dusty
and
windy
and
cold
and
now
and
then
a
little
dribbling
of
rain
and
what
made
it
worse
there
were
so
many
hackney
coaches
as
spoiled
the
sight
of
the
gentlemen
and
so
we
had
little
pleasure
lord
day
up
and
by
water
to
white
hall
and
there
visited
my
lord
sandwich
who
after
about
two
months
absence
at
hinchingbroke
came
to
town
last
night
i
saw
him
and
he
was
very
kind
and
i
am
glad
he
is
so
i
having
not
wrote
to
him
all
the
time
my
eyes
indeed
not
letting
me
here
with
sir
charles
harbord
and
my
lord
hinchingbroke
and
sidney
and
we
looked
upon
the
picture
of
tangier
designed
by
charles
harbord
and
drawn
by
dancre
which
my
lord
sandwich
admires
as
being
the
truest
picture
that
ever
he
saw
in
his
life
and
it
is
indeed
very
pretty
and
i
will
be
at
the
cost
of
having
one
of
them
thence
with
them
to
white
hall
and
there
walked
out
the
sermon
with
one
or
other
and
then
saw
the
duke
of
york
and
he
talked
to
me
a
little
and
so
away
back
by
water
home
up
and
coach
to
my
lord
brouncker
where
sir
carteret
did
meet
sir
minnes
and
me
to
discourse
upon
business
who
was
directed
in
the
time
of
the
war
to
provide
provisions
at
hamburgh
by
sir
carteret
direction
and
now
sir
carteret
is
afraid
to
own
it
it
being
done
without
written
order
but
by
our
meeting
we
do
all
begin
to
recollect
enough
to
preserve
deering
which
i
think
poor
silly
man
i
shall
be
glad
of
it
being
too
much
he
should
suffer
for
endeavouring
to
serve
us
thence
to
james
where
the
duke
of
york
was
playing
in
the
pell
mell
and
so
he
called
me
to
him
most
part
of
the
time
that
he
played
which
was
an
hour
and
talked
alone
to
me
and
among
other
things
tells
me
how
the
king
will
not
yet
be
got
to
name
any
body
in
the
room
of
pen
but
puts
it
off
for
three
or
four
days
from
whence
he
do
collect
that
they
are
brewing
something
for
the
navy
but
what
he
knows
not
but
i
perceive
is
vexed
that
things
should
go
so
and
he
hath
reason
for
he
told
me
that
it
is
likely
they
will
do
in
this
as
in
other
things
resolve
first
and
consider
it
and
the
fitness
of
it
afterwards
thence
to
white
hall
and
met
with
creed
and
discoursed
of
matters
and
i
perceive
by
him
that
he
makes
no
doubt
but
that
all
will
turn
to
the
old
religion
for
these
people
can
not
hold
things
in
their
hands
nor
prevent
its
coming
to
that
and
by
his
discourse
he
fits
himself
for
it
and
would
have
my
lord
sandwich
do
so
too
and
me
after
a
little
talk
with
him
and
particularly
about
the
ruinous
condition
of
tangier
which
i
have
a
great
mind
to
lay
before
the
duke
of
york
but
dare
not
because
of
his
great
kindness
to
lord
middleton
before
it
be
too
late
we
parted
and
i
homeward
but
called
at
povy
and
there
he
stopped
me
to
dinner
there
being
williamson
the
lieutenant
of
the
tower
child
and
several
others
and
after
dinner
povy
and
i
together
to
talk
of
tangier
and
he
would
have
me
move
the
duke
of
york
in
it
for
it
concerns
him
particularly
more
than
any
as
being
the
head
of
us
and
i
do
think
to
do
it
to
james
and
thence
with
the
duke
of
york
to
white
hall
where
the
board
waited
on
him
all
the
morning
and
so
at
noon
with
sir
thomas
allen
and
sir
edward
scott
sir
edward
scott
made
at
oxford
and
lord
carlingford
to
the
spanish
embassador
where
i
dined
the
first
time
the
olio
not
so
good
as
shere
there
was
at
the
table
himself
and
a
spanish
countess
a
good
comely
and
witty
lady
three
fathers
and
us
discourse
good
and
pleasant
and
here
was
an
oxford
scholar
in
doctor
of
laws
gowne
sent
from
the
college
where
the
embassador
lay
when
the
court
was
there
to
salute
him
before
his
return
to
spain
this
man
though
a
gentle
sort
of
scholar
yet
sat
like
a
fool
for
want
of
french
or
spanish
but
knew
only
latin
which
he
spoke
like
an
englishman
to
one
of
the
fathers
and
by
and
by
he
and
i
to
talk
and
the
company
very
merry
at
my
defending
cambridge
against
oxford
and
i
made
much
use
of
my
french
and
spanish
here
to
my
great
content
but
the
dinner
not
extraordinary
at
all
either
quantity
or
quality
up
and
by
coach
to
sir
coventry
and
there
to
talk
with
him
a
great
deal
with
great
content
and
so
to
the
duke
of
york
having
a
great
mind
to
speak
to
him
about
tangier
but
when
i
came
to
it
his
interest
for
my
lord
middleton
is
such
that
i
dared
not
after
dinner
all
the
afternoon
within
with
hater
gibson
and
hewer
reading
over
and
drawing
up
new
things
in
the
instructions
of
commanders
which
will
be
good
and
i
hope
to
get
them
confirmed
by
the
duke
of
york
though
i
perceive
nothing
will
effectually
perfect
them
but
to
look
over
the
whole
body
of
the
instructions
of
all
the
officers
of
a
ship
and
make
them
all
perfect
together
this
being
done
comes
my
bookseller
and
brings
me
home
hound
my
collection
of
papers
about
my
addresse
to
the
duke
of
york
in
august
which
makes
me
glad
it
being
that
which
shall
do
me
more
right
many
years
hence
than
perhaps
all
i
ever
did
in
my
life
and
therefore
i
do
both
for
my
own
and
the
king
sake
value
it
much
by
and
by
also
comes
browne
the
mathematical
and
brings
me
home
my
instrument
for
perspective
made
according
to
the
description
of
in
the
late
transactions
and
he
hath
made
it
i
think
very
well
and
that
i
believe
will
do
the
thing
and
therein
gives
me
great
content
but
i
have
i
fear
all
the
content
that
must
be
received
by
my
eyes
which
are
almost
lost
to
white
hall
where
the
duke
of
york
met
the
office
and
there
discoursed
of
several
things
particularly
the
instructions
of
commanders
of
ships
but
here
happened
by
chance
a
discourse
of
the
council
of
trade
against
which
the
duke
of
york
is
mightily
displeased
and
particularly
child
against
whom
he
speaking
hardly
captain
cox
did
second
the
duke
of
york
by
saying
that
he
was
talked
on
for
an
unfayre
dealer
with
masters
of
ships
about
freight
to
which
sir
littleton
very
hotly
and
foolishly
replied
presently
that
he
never
heard
any
honest
man
speak
ill
of
child
to
which
the
duke
of
york
did
make
a
smart
reply
and
was
angry
so
as
i
was
sorry
to
hear
it
come
so
far
and
that
i
by
seeming
to
assent
to
cox
might
be
observed
too
much
by
littleton
though
i
said
nothing
aloud
for
this
must
breed
great
after
this
meeting
done
the
duke
of
york
took
the
treasurers
into
his
closet
to
chide
them
as
wren
tells
me
for
that
my
lord
keeper
did
last
night
at
the
council
say
when
nobody
was
ready
to
say
anything
against
the
constitution
of
the
navy
that
he
did
believe
the
treasurers
of
the
navy
had
something
to
say
which
was
very
foul
on
their
part
to
be
parties
against
us
they
being
gone
wren
took
boat
thinking
to
dine
with
my
lord
of
canterbury
gilbert
sheldon
but
when
we
came
to
lambeth
the
gate
was
shut
which
is
strictly
done
at
twelve
and
nobody
comes
in
afterwards
so
we
lost
our
labour
and
therefore
back
to
white
hall
and
thence
walked
to
my
lord
crewe
whom
i
have
not
seen
since
he
was
sick
which
is
eight
months
ago
i
think
and
there
dined
with
him
he
is
mightily
broke
a
stranger
a
country
gentleman
was
with
him
and
he
pleased
with
my
discourse
accidentally
about
the
decay
of
gentlemen
families
in
the
country
telling
us
that
the
old
rule
was
that
a
family
might
remain
fifty
miles
from
london
one
hundred
years
one
hundred
miles
from
london
two
hundred
years
and
so
farther
or
nearer
london
more
or
less
years
he
also
told
us
that
he
hath
heard
his
father
say
that
in
his
time
it
was
so
rare
for
a
country
gentleman
to
come
to
london
that
when
he
did
come
he
used
to
make
his
will
before
he
set
out
thence
to
james
and
there
met
the
duke
of
york
who
told
me
with
great
content
that
he
did
now
think
he
should
master
our
adversaries
for
that
the
king
did
tell
him
that
he
was
satisfied
in
the
constitution
of
the
navy
but
that
it
was
well
to
give
these
people
leave
to
object
against
it
which
they
having
not
done
he
did
give
order
to
give
warrant
to
the
duke
of
york
to
direct
sir
jeremy
smith
to
be
a
commissioner
of
the
navy
in
the
room
of
pen
which
though
he
be
an
impertinent
fellow
yet
i
am
glad
of
it
it
showing
that
the
other
side
is
not
so
strong
as
it
was
and
so
in
plain
terms
the
duke
of
york
did
tell
me
that
they
were
every
day
losing
ground
and
particularly
that
he
would
take
care
to
keep
out
child
at
all
which
i
am
glad
though
yet
i
dare
not
think
myself
secure
but
the
king
may
yet
be
wrought
upon
by
these
people
to
bring
changes
in
our
office
and
remove
us
ere
it
be
long
to
white
hall
to
a
committee
of
tangier
where
i
see
all
things
going
to
rack
in
the
business
of
the
corporation
and
consequently
in
the
place
by
middleton
going
thence
walked
a
little
with
creed
who
tells
me
he
hears
how
fine
my
horses
and
coach
are
and
advises
me
to
avoid
being
noted
for
it
which
i
was
vexed
to
hear
taken
notice
of
being
what
i
feared
and
povy
told
me
of
my
sleeves
in
the
park
yesterday
which
vexed
me
also
so
as
to
resolve
never
to
appear
in
court
with
them
but
presently
to
have
them
taken
off
as
it
is
fit
i
should
my
wife
up
by
four
to
go
to
gather
some
trouble
for
fear
of
the
queene
miscarrying
she
being
as
they
all
conclude
far
gone
with
child
my
brother
john
tells
me
the
first
news
that
my
sister
jackson
is
with
child
and
far
gone
at
noon
comes
my
lord
hinchingbroke
and
sidney
and
sir
charles
harbord
and
roger
pepys
and
dined
with
me
and
had
a
good
dinner
and
very
merry
with
us
all
the
afternoon
it
being
a
farewell
to
sidney
at
noon
to
dinner
with
wren
to
lambeth
with
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
the
first
time
i
was
ever
there
and
i
have
long
longed
for
it
where
a
noble
house
and
well
furnished
with
good
pictures
and
furniture
and
noble
attendance
in
good
order
and
a
great
deal
of
company
though
an
ordinary
day
and
exceeding
great
cheer
no
where
better
or
so
much
that
ever
i
think
i
saw
for
an
ordinary
table
and
the
bishop
mighty
kind
to
me
particularly
desiring
my
company
another
time
when
less
company
there
most
of
the
company
gone
and
i
going
i
heard
by
a
gentleman
of
a
sermon
that
was
to
be
there
and
so
i
staid
to
hear
it
thinking
it
serious
till
by
and
by
the
gentleman
told
me
it
was
a
mockery
by
one
cornet
bolton
a
very
man
that
behind
a
chair
did
pray
and
preach
like
a
presbyter
scot
with
all
the
possible
imitation
in
grimaces
and
voice
and
his
text
about
the
hanging
up
their
harps
upon
the
willows
and
a
serious
good
sermon
too
exclaiming
against
bishops
and
crying
up
of
my
good
lord
eglington
till
it
made
us
all
burst
but
i
did
wonder
to
have
the
bishop
at
this
time
to
make
himself
sport
with
things
of
this
kind
but
i
perceive
it
was
shown
him
as
a
rarity
and
he
took
care
to
have
the
shut
but
there
were
about
twenty
gentlemen
there
and
myself
infinitely
pleased
with
the
novelty
so
over
to
white
hall
to
a
little
committee
of
tangier
and
thence
walking
in
the
gallery
i
met
sir
thomas
osborne
who
to
my
great
content
did
of
his
own
accord
fall
into
discourse
with
me
with
such
professions
of
value
and
respect
placing
the
whole
virtue
of
the
office
of
the
navy
upon
me
and
that
for
the
controller
place
no
man
in
england
was
fit
for
it
but
me
when
sir
minnes
as
he
says
it
is
necessary
is
removed
but
then
knows
not
what
to
do
for
a
man
in
my
place
and
in
discourse
though
i
have
no
mind
to
the
other
did
bring
in
tom
hater
to
be
the
fittest
man
in
the
world
for
it
which
he
took
good
notice
of
but
in
the
whole
i
was
mightily
pleased
reckoning
myself
fifty
per
cent
securer
in
my
place
than
i
did
before
think
myself
to
be
by
water
with
my
brother
as
high
as
fulham
talking
and
singing
and
playing
the
rogue
with
the
western
bargemen
about
the
women
of
woolwich
which
mads
them
i
all
the
afternoon
drawing
up
a
foul
draught
of
my
petition
to
the
duke
of
york
about
my
eyes
for
leave
to
spend
three
or
four
months
out
of
the
office
drawing
it
so
as
to
give
occasion
to
a
voyage
abroad
which
i
did
to
my
pretty
good
liking
and
then
with
my
wife
to
hyde
park
where
a
good
deal
of
company
and
good
weather
great
news
now
of
the
french
taking
domingo
in
spaniola
from
the
spaniards
which
troubles
us
that
they
should
have
got
it
and
have
the
honour
of
taking
it
when
we
could
not
with
my
coach
to
james
and
there
finding
the
duke
of
york
gone
to
muster
his
men
in
hyde
park
i
alone
with
my
boy
thither
and
there
saw
more
walking
out
of
my
coach
as
other
gentlemen
did
of
a
soldier
trade
than
ever
i
did
in
my
life
the
men
being
mighty
fine
and
their
commanders
particularly
the
duke
of
monmouth
but
methought
their
trade
but
very
easy
as
to
the
mustering
of
their
men
and
the
men
but
indifferently
ready
to
perform
what
was
commanded
in
the
handling
of
their
arms
here
the
news
was
first
talked
of
harry
killigrew
being
wounded
in
nine
places
last
night
by
footmen
in
the
highway
going
from
the
park
in
a
hackney
coach
towards
hammersmith
to
his
house
at
turnham
greene
they
being
supposed
to
be
my
lady
men
she
being
by
in
her
coach
with
six
horses
upon
an
old
grudge
of
his
saying
openly
that
he
had
intrigued
with
her
thence
by
and
by
to
white
hall
and
there
i
waited
upon
the
king
and
queene
all
dinner
time
in
the
queene
lodgings
she
being
in
her
white
pinner
and
appearing
like
a
woman
with
child
and
she
seemed
handsomer
plain
so
than
dressed
and
by
and
by
dinner
done
i
out
and
to
walk
in
the
gallery
for
the
duke
of
coming
out
and
there
meeting
may
he
took
me
down
about
four
to
chevin
lodgings
and
all
alone
did
get
me
a
dish
of
cold
chickens
and
good
wine
and
i
dined
like
a
prince
being
before
very
hungry
and
empty
by
and
by
the
duke
of
york
comes
and
readily
took
me
to
his
closet
and
received
my
petition
and
discoursed
about
my
eyes
and
pitied
me
and
with
much
kindness
did
give
me
his
consent
to
be
absent
and
approved
of
my
proposition
to
go
into
holland
to
observe
things
there
of
the
navy
but
would
first
ask
the
king
leave
which
he
anon
did
and
did
tell
me
that
the
king
would
be
a
good
master
to
me
these
were
his
words
about
my
eyes
and
do
like
of
my
going
into
holland
but
do
advise
that
nobody
should
know
of
my
going
thither
and
that
i
should
pretend
to
go
into
the
country
somewhere
which
i
liked
well
in
discourse
this
afternoon
the
duke
of
york
did
tell
me
that
he
was
the
most
amazed
at
one
thing
just
now
that
ever
he
was
in
his
life
which
was
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
did
just
now
come
into
the
queene
where
the
king
was
with
much
mixed
company
and
among
others
tom
killigrew
the
father
of
harry
who
was
last
night
wounded
so
as
to
be
in
danger
of
death
and
his
man
is
quite
dead
and
there
did
say
that
he
had
spoke
with
some
one
that
was
by
which
person
all
the
world
must
know
must
be
his
mistress
my
lady
shrewsbury
who
says
that
they
did
not
mean
to
hurt
but
beat
him
and
that
he
did
run
first
at
them
with
his
sword
so
that
he
do
hereby
clearly
discover
that
he
knows
who
did
it
and
is
of
conspiracy
with
them
being
of
known
conspiracy
with
her
which
the
duke
of
york
did
seem
to
be
pleased
with
and
said
it
might
perhaps
cost
him
his
life
in
the
house
of
lords
and
i
find
was
mightily
pleased
with
it
saying
it
was
the
most
impudent
thing
as
well
as
the
most
foolish
that
ever
he
knew
man
do
in
all
his
life
with
my
eyes
mighty
weary
and
my
head
full
of
care
how
to
get
my
accounts
and
business
settled
against
my
journey
home
to
supper
and
to
bed
to
white
hall
where
i
attended
the
duke
of
york
and
was
by
him
led
to
the
king
who
expressed
great
sense
of
my
misfortune
in
my
eyes
and
concernment
for
their
recovery
and
accordingly
signified
not
only
his
assent
to
my
desire
therein
but
commanded
me
to
give
them
rest
this
summer
according
to
my
late
petition
to
the
duke
of
york
to
white
hall
where
all
the
morning
dined
with
chevins
with
alderman
backewell
and
spragg
the
court
full
of
the
news
from
captain
hubbert
of
the
milford
touching
his
being
affronted
in
the
streights
shot
at
and
having
eight
men
killed
him
by
a
french
calling
him
english
dog
and
commanding
him
to
strike
which
he
refused
and
as
knowing
himself
much
too
weak
for
him
made
away
from
him
the
queen
as
being
supposed
with
child
fell
ill
so
as
to
call
for
madam
nun
chevins
sister
and
one
of
her
women
from
dinner
from
us
this
being
the
last
day
of
their
doubtfulness
touching
her
being
with
child
and
they
were
therein
well
confirmed
by
her
being
well
again
before
night
one
sir
edmund
bury
godfry
supposed
to
have
been
murdered
by
the
papists
october
when
he
was
found
pierced
with
his
own
sword
and
with
several
marks
of
violence
on
his
body
a
woodmonger
and
justice
of
peace
in
westminster
having
two
days
since
arrested
sir
alexander
frazier
for
about
in
firing
the
bailiffs
were
apprehended
committed
to
the
porter
lodge
and
there
by
the
king
command
the
last
night
severely
whipped
from
which
the
justice
himself
very
hardly
escaped
to
such
an
unusual
degree
was
the
king
moved
therein
but
he
lies
now
in
the
lodge
justifying
his
act
as
grounded
upon
the
opinion
of
several
of
the
judges
and
among
others
my
lord
which
makes
the
king
very
angry
with
the
as
they
say
and
the
justice
do
lie
and
justify
his
act
and
says
he
will
suffer
in
the
cause
for
the
people
and
do
refuse
to
receive
almost
any
nutriment
the
effects
of
it
may
be
bad
to
the
court
to
james
where
the
king
being
with
the
duke
of
york
prevented
a
meeting
of
the
tangier
commission
but
lord
what
a
deal
of
sorry
discourse
did
i
hear
between
the
king
and
several
lords
about
him
here
but
very
mean
methought
so
with
creed
to
the
and
back
to
white
hall
where
in
the
park
sir
carteret
did
give
an
account
of
his
discourse
lately
with
the
commissioners
of
accounts
who
except
against
many
things
but
none
that
i
find
considerable
among
others
that
of
the
officers
of
the
navy
selling
of
the
king
goods
and
particularly
my
providing
him
with
calico
flags
which
having
been
by
order
and
but
once
when
necessity
and
the
apparent
profit
justified
it
as
conformable
to
my
particular
duty
it
will
prove
to
my
advantage
that
it
be
enquired
into
nevertheless
having
this
morning
received
from
them
a
demand
of
an
account
of
all
monies
within
their
cognizance
received
and
issued
by
me
i
was
willing
upon
this
hint
to
give
myself
rest
by
knowing
whether
their
meaning
therein
might
reach
only
to
my
treasurership
for
tangier
or
the
monies
employed
on
this
occasion
i
went
therefore
to
them
this
afternoon
to
understand
what
monies
they
meant
where
they
answered
me
by
saying
the
eleven
months
tax
customs
and
prize
money
without
mentioning
any
more
or
than
i
demanding
the
service
they
respected
therein
and
so
without
further
discourse
we
parted
upon
very
good
terms
of
respect
and
with
few
words
but
my
mind
not
fully
satisfied
about
the
monies
they
mean
the
king
to
white
hall
where
all
very
gay
and
particularly
the
prince
of
tuscany
very
fine
and
is
the
first
day
of
his
appearing
out
of
mourning
since
he
came
i
heard
the
bishop
of
peterborough
joseph
henshaw
ob
preach
but
dully
but
a
good
anthem
of
pelham
home
to
dinner
and
then
with
my
wife
to
hyde
park
where
all
the
evening
great
store
of
company
and
great
preparations
by
the
prince
of
tuscany
to
celebrate
the
night
with
for
the
king
birthday
and
so
home
whitsunday
by
water
to
white
hall
and
thence
to
sir
coventry
where
all
the
morning
by
his
he
being
indisposed
our
discourse
was
upon
the
notes
i
have
lately
prepared
for
commanders
instructions
but
concluded
that
nothing
will
render
them
effectual
without
an
amendment
in
the
choice
of
them
that
they
be
seamen
and
not
gentlemen
above
the
command
of
the
admiral
by
the
greatness
of
their
relations
at
court
thence
to
white
hall
and
dined
with
chevins
and
his
sister
whither
by
and
by
came
in
progers
and
sir
thomas
allen
and
by
and
by
fine
wells
who
is
a
great
beauty
and
there
i
had
my
full
gaze
upon
her
to
my
great
content
she
being
a
woman
of
pretty
conversation
thence
to
the
duke
of
york
who
with
the
officers
of
the
navy
made
a
good
entrance
on
my
draught
of
my
new
instructions
to
commanders
as
well
expressing
his
generalls
of
a
reformation
among
them
as
liking
of
my
humble
offers
towards
it
thence
being
called
by
my
wife
we
to
the
park
whence
the
rain
sent
us
suddenly
home
up
very
betimes
and
continued
all
the
morning
with
hewer
upon
examining
and
stating
my
accounts
in
order
to
the
fitting
myself
to
go
abroad
beyond
sea
which
the
ill
condition
of
my
eyes
and
my
neglect
for
a
year
or
two
hath
kept
me
hand
in
and
so
as
to
render
it
very
difficult
now
and
troublesome
to
my
mind
to
do
it
but
i
this
day
made
a
satisfactory
entrance
therein
had
another
meeting
with
the
duke
of
york
at
white
hall
on
yesterday
work
and
made
a
good
advance
and
so
being
called
by
my
wife
we
to
the
park
mary
batelier
and
a
dutch
gentleman
a
friend
of
hers
being
with
us
thence
to
the
world
end
a
drinking
house
by
the
park
and
there
merry
and
so
home
late
and
thus
ends
all
that
i
doubt
i
shall
ever
be
able
to
do
with
my
own
eyes
in
the
keeping
of
my
journall
i
being
not
able
to
do
it
any
longer
having
done
now
so
long
as
to
undo
my
eyes
almost
every
time
that
i
take
a
pen
in
my
hand
and
therefore
whatever
comes
of
it
i
must
forbear
and
therefore
resolve
from
this
time
forward
to
have
it
kept
by
my
people
in
and
must
be
contented
to
set
down
no
more
than
is
fit
for
them
and
all
the
world
to
know
or
if
there
be
any
thing
i
must
endeavour
to
keep
a
margin
in
my
book
open
to
add
here
and
there
a
note
in
with
my
own
hand
and
so
i
betake
myself
to
that
course
which
is
almost
as
much
as
to
see
myself
go
into
my
grave
for
which
and
all
the
discomforts
that
will
accompany
my
being
blind
the
good
god
prepare
me
may
