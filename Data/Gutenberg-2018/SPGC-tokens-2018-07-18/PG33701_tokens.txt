the

of

charity
fraternal
charity
i
charity
the
peculiar
virtue
of
christ
our
divine
saviour
shows
both
by
precept
and
example
that
his
favourite
virtue
his
own
and
in
a
certain
sense
characteristic
virtue
was
charity
whether
he
treated
with
his
ignorant
and
rude
apostles
with
the
sick
and
poor
or
with
his
enemies
and
sinners
he
is
always
benign
condescending
merciful
affable
patient
in
a
word
his
charity
appeared
in
all
its
most
amiable
forms
oh
how
well
these
titles
suit
him
a
king
full
of
clemency
a
lamb
full
of
mildness
how
justly
could
he
say
learn
of
me
that
i
am
meek
and
humble
of
heart
his
yoke
was
sweet
his
burden
light
his
conversation
without
sadness
or
bitterness
he
lightened
the
burdens
of
those
heavily
laden
he
consoled
those
in
sorrow
he
quenched
not
the
dying
spark
nor
broke
the
bruised
reed
he
calls
us
his
friends
his
brothers
his
little
flock
and
as
the
greatest
sign
of
friendship
is
to
die
for
those
we
love
he
gave
to
each
of
us
the
right
to
say
with
paul
he
loved
me
and
delivered
himself
up
for
me
let
us
then
say
my
good
master
i
love
thee
and
deliver
myself
up
for
thee
religious
called
to
reproduce
the
three
great
virtues
of
jesus
christ
poverty
chastity
and
obedience
have
still
another
to
practise
not
less
noble
or
distinctive
fraternal
charity
by
this
virtue
they
are
not
called
to
rise
above
earthly
or
sensual
pleasures
nor
above
their
judgment
and
but
above
egotism
and
which
shoot
their
roots
deepest
in
the
soul
they
must
consider
attentively
the
fundamental
truths
on
which
charity
is
based
and
its
effects
as
also
the
principal
obstacles
to
its
attainment
and
the
means
to
overcome
them
ii
first
fundamental
truth
are
all
members
of
the
great
christian
charity
towards
our
neighbour
is
charity
towards
god
in
our
neighbour
because
faith
assuring
us
that
god
is
our
father
jesus
christ
our
head
the
holy
ghost
our
sanctifier
it
follows
that
to
love
our
neighbour
inasmuch
as
he
is
the
child
of
god
the
member
of
jesus
christ
and
the
sanctuary
of
the
holy
ghost
is
to
love
in
a
special
manner
our
heavenly
father
his
son
together
with
the
holy
spirit
and
because
it
is
scarcely
possible
for
religious
to
behold
their
brethren
in
this
light
without
wishing
them
what
the
most
holy
trinity
so
lovingly
desires
to
bestow
on
them
acts
of
fraternal
charity
include
almost
necessarily
at
least
implicit
acts
of
faith
and
hope
and
the
exercise
of
the
noblest
of
the
theological
virtues
thus
often
becomes
an
exercise
of
the
other
two
thus
it
is
that
charity
poured
into
our
hearts
by
the
holy
spirit
uniting
christians
among
themselves
and
with
the
adorable
trinity
whose
images
they
are
is
the
vivid
and
perfect
imitation
of
the
love
of
the
father
for
the
son
and
of
the
son
for
the
father
a
substantial
love
which
is
no
other
than
the
holy
ghost
and
makes
us
all
one
in
god
by
grace
as
the
father
and
son
are
only
one
god
with
the
holy
ghost
by
nature
according
to
the
words
of
our
lord
that
they
all
may
be
one
as
thou
father
in
me
and
i
in
thee
that
they
also
may
be
one
in
us
such
is
the
chain
that
unites
and
binds
us
a
chain
of
gold
a
thousand
times
stronger
than
those
of
flesh
and
blood
interest
or
friendship
because
these
permit
the
defects
of
body
and
the
vices
of
the
soul
to
be
seen
whilst
charity
covers
all
hides
all
to
offer
exclusively
to
admiration
and
love
the
work
of
the
hands
of
god
the
price
of
the
blood
of
jesus
christ
and
the
masterpiece
of
the
holy
spirit
iii
second
fundamental
truth
are
members
of
the
same
religious
to
love
our
brethren
as
ourselves
in
relation
to
god
it
suffices
without
doubt
to
have
with
them
the
same
faith
the
same
sacraments
the
same
head
the
same
life
the
same
immortal
hopes
etc
but
besides
these
there
exist
other
considerations
which
lead
friendship
and
fraternity
to
a
higher
degree
among
the
members
of
the
same
religious
order
all
in
the
novitiate
have
been
cast
in
the
same
mould
or
rather
have
imbibed
the
milk
of
knowledge
and
piety
from
the
breasts
of
the
same
mother
all
follow
the
same
rules
all
tend
to
the
same
end
by
the
same
means
all
from
morning
to
night
and
during
their
whole
lives
perform
the
same
exercises
live
under
the
same
roof
work
sanctify
themselves
suffer
and
rejoice
together
like
they
have
the
same
interests
like
soldiers
the
same
combats
like
children
of
a
family
the
same
ancestors
and
heirlooms
and
like
friends
a
communication
of
ideas
and
interchange
of
sentiments
if
our
lord
said
to
christians
in
general
this
is
my
commandment
that
you
love
one
another
as
i
have
loved
you
by
this
shall
all
men
know
that
you
are
my
disciples
if
you
have
love
for
one
another
john
xiii
can
he
not
say
to
the
members
of
the
same
religious
order
this
is
my
own
and
special
recommendation
before
all
and
above
all
preserve
amongst
you
a
mutual
charity
have
but
one
soul
in
several
different
bodies
you
will
be
recognized
as
religious
and
brethren
not
by
the
same
habit
vows
and
virtues
nor
by
the
particular
work
entrusted
to
you
by
the
church
but
by
the
love
you
have
one
for
the
other
ah
who
will
love
you
if
you
do
not
love
one
another
love
one
another
fraternally
because
as
human
beings
you
have
only
one
heavenly
father
love
one
another
holily
because
as
christians
you
have
only
one
head
love
one
another
tenderly
because
as
religious
you
have
only
one
mother
your
order
it
is
impossible
for
religious
to
love
their
brethren
with
a
true
sincere
pure
and
constant
love
if
they
do
not
look
at
them
in
this
light
iv
the
family
spirit
based
on
the
foregoing
principles
fraternal
charity
begets
the
family
spirit
that
spirit
which
forgets
itself
in
thinking
only
of
the
common
good
which
makes
particular
give
way
to
general
interests
which
forces
oneself
to
live
with
all
without
exception
to
live
as
all
without
singularity
and
to
live
for
all
without
that
spirit
which
binding
like
a
divine
cement
all
parts
of
the
mysterious
edifice
of
religion
uniting
all
hearts
in
one
and
all
wills
in
one
permits
the
community
to
proceed
firmly
and
securely
and
its
members
to
work
out
efficaciously
and
peacefully
their
personal
sanctification
and
perfection
in
fine
that
spirit
which
gives
to
all
religious
not
only
an
inexpressible
family
happiness
but
a
delicious
foretaste
of
heaven
which
renders
them
invincible
to
their
enemies
and
causes
to
be
said
of
them
with
admiration
see
how
they
love
one
another
writing
on
these
words
of
the
psalmist
behold
how
good
and
pleasant
it
is
for
brethren
to
live
together
in
union
augustine
cries
out
behold
the
words
which
make
monasteries
spring
up
sweet
delightful
and
delicious
words
which
fill
the
soul
and
ear
with
jubilation
yes
certainly
the
happiness
of
community
life
is
great
and
its
advantages
inappreciable
but
without
the
family
spirit
there
is
no
community
as
there
would
be
no
beauty
in
the
human
body
without
harmony
in
its
members
oh
never
forget
this
comparison
you
who
wish
to
live
happy
in
religion
and
who
wish
to
make
others
happy
a
community
is
a
body
now
as
the
members
of
a
body
each
in
its
proper
place
and
functions
live
in
perfect
harmony
mutually
comfort
defend
and
love
each
other
without
being
jealous
or
vengeful
and
have
only
in
view
the
of
that
body
of
which
they
are
parts
so
in
the
community
of
which
you
are
members
and
in
the
employment
assigned
to
you
remember
you
are
parts
of
a
whole
and
that
it
is
necessary
to
refer
to
this
whole
your
time
labour
and
strength
to
have
the
same
thoughts
sentiments
designs
and
language
without
which
there
would
no
longer
exist
either
body
members
parts
or
whole
if
you
wish
then
to
obtain
and
practise
the
family
spirit
study
what
passes
within
you
your
actions
bespeak
your
sentiments
v
egotism
or
egotism
taking
for
its
motto
every
one
for
himself
is
very
much
opposed
to
fraternal
charity
and
the
family
spirit
it
never
hesitates
when
occasion
offers
to
sacrifice
the
common
good
to
its
own
it
isolates
the
individuals
makes
them
concentrated
in
self
places
them
in
the
community
but
not
of
it
makes
them
strangers
amongst
their
brethren
and
tends
to
justify
the
words
of
an
impious
writer
who
calls
monasteries
reunions
of
persons
who
know
not
each
other
who
live
without
love
and
die
without
being
regretted
egotism
breeds
distrust
jealousy
parties
aversions
it
destroys
abnegation
humility
patience
and
all
other
virtues
it
introduces
a
universal
disgust
and
discontent
makes
religious
lose
their
first
fervour
presents
an
image
of
hell
where
one
expected
to
find
a
heaven
on
earth
saps
the
very
foundation
of
community
life
and
leads
sooner
or
later
to
inevitable
ruin
as
the
family
spirit
causes
the
growth
and
prosperity
of
an
order
however
feeble
its
beginning
so
on
the
other
hand
egotism
dries
the
sap
and
renders
it
powerless
no
matter
what
other
advantages
it
may
enjoy
if
the
one
by
uniting
hearts
is
a
principle
of
strength
and
duration
the
other
by
dividing
is
a
principle
of
dissolution
and
decay
sallust
says
that
the
weakest
things
become
powerful
by
concord
and
the
greatest
perish
through
discord
whilst
the
descendants
of
noah
spoke
the
same
language
the
building
of
the
tower
of
babel
proceeded
with
rapidity
from
the
moment
they
ceased
to
understand
one
another
its
destruction
commenced
and
the
monument
which
was
to
have
immortalized
their
name
was
left
in
ruin
to
tell
their
shame
and
pride
on
each
of
the
four
corners
of
the
monastery
religion
or
charity
personified
ought
to
be
placed
bearing
on
shields
in
large
characters
the
following
words
love
one
another
he
who
is
not
with
me
is
against
me
and
he
who
gathers
not
with
me
scatters
every
kingdom
divided
will
become
desolate
they
had
all
but
one
heart
and
one
soul
vi
first
characteristic
of
fraternal
charity
esteem
our
brethren
charity
the
sister
of
humility
says
paul
is
not
puffed
up
she
can
not
live
with
pride
the
disease
of
a
soul
full
of
itself
it
willingly
prefers
others
by
considering
their
good
qualities
and
one
own
defects
and
shows
this
exteriorly
when
occasion
offers
by
many
sincere
proofs
it
always
looks
on
others
from
the
most
favourable
point
instead
of
closing
the
eyes
on
fifty
virtues
to
find
out
one
fault
without
any
other
profit
than
to
satisfy
a
natural
perverseness
and
to
excuse
one
own
failings
it
closes
the
eyes
on
fifty
faults
to
open
them
on
one
virtue
with
the
double
advantage
of
being
edified
and
of
blessing
god
the
author
of
all
good
since
an
unfavourable
thought
or
the
sight
of
an
action
apparently
reprehensible
tends
to
cloud
the
reputation
of
a
religious
charity
hastens
before
the
cloud
thickens
to
drive
it
away
saying
what
am
i
doing
should
i
blacken
in
my
mind
the
image
of
god
and
seek
deformities
in
the
member
of
jesus
christ
besides
can
not
my
brethren
be
eminently
holy
and
be
subject
to
many
faults
which
god
permits
them
to
fall
into
in
order
to
keep
them
humble
to
teach
them
to
help
others
and
to
exercise
their
patience
vii
second
characteristic
treat
brethren
with
respect
openness
and
exterior
honour
being
the
effect
and
sign
of
interior
esteem
charity
honours
all
those
whom
it
esteems
superiors
equals
the
young
and
the
old
it
carefully
observes
all
propriety
and
takes
into
consideration
the
different
circumstances
of
age
employment
merit
character
birth
and
education
to
make
itself
all
to
all
convinced
that
god
is
not
unworthy
to
have
persons
in
his
service
and
that
religious
ought
not
to
respect
themselves
less
than
people
in
the
world
it
conforms
to
all
the
requirements
of
politeness
as
far
as
religious
simplicity
will
permit
not
that
politeness
which
is
feigned
and
hypocritical
and
which
is
merely
a
sham
expression
of
deceitful
respect
but
that
politeness
the
flower
of
charity
which
manifesting
exteriorly
the
sentiments
of
a
sincere
affection
and
a
true
devotion
is
accompanied
with
a
graceful
countenance
benign
and
affable
regards
sweetness
in
words
foresight
urbanity
and
delicacy
in
business
in
fine
that
politeness
which
is
the
fruit
of
and
humility
no
less
than
of
charity
and
friendship
which
is
the
art
of
and
without
restraining
others
which
is
the
care
of
avoiding
everything
that
might
displease
and
doing
all
that
can
please
in
order
to
make
others
content
with
us
and
with
themselves
in
a
word
a
mixture
of
discretion
and
complaisance
cordiality
and
respect
together
with
words
and
manners
full
of
mildness
and
benignity
viii
third
characteristic
work
harmoniously
with
those
in
the
same
employment
and
not
to
cause
any
inconvenience
to
why
should
we
cling
so
obstinately
to
our
own
way
of
seeing
and
doing
do
not
many
ways
and
means
serve
the
same
ends
provided
they
be
employed
wisely
and
perseveringly
some
have
succeeded
by
their
methods
and
i
by
mine
a
proof
that
success
is
reached
through
many
ways
and
that
it
is
not
by
disputing
it
is
obtained
nor
by
giving
scandal
to
those
we
should
edify
nor
perhaps
by
compromising
the
good
work
in
which
we
are
employed
the
four
animals
mentioned
by
ezekiel
joined
their
wings
were
moved
by
the
same
spirit
and
animated
by
the
same
ardour
and
so
drew
the
heavenly
chariot
with
majesty
and
rapidity
giving
us
religious
an
example
of
perfect
union
of
efforts
and
thoughts
charity
avoids
haughty
and
contemptuous
looks
forewarns
itself
against
fads
and
manias
and
in
the
midst
of
most
pressing
occupations
carefully
guards
against
rudeness
and
impatience
careful
of
wounding
the
susceptibility
of
others
it
neither
blames
nor
despises
those
who
act
in
an
opposite
way
religious
animated
by
fraternal
charity
are
not
ticklish
spirits
who
are
disturbed
for
nothing
at
all
and
who
do
not
know
how
to
pass
unnoticed
a
little
want
of
respect
etc
nor
punctilious
spirits
who
find
pleasure
in
contradicting
and
making
irritating
remarks
nor
spirits
who
pose
themselves
as
supreme
judges
of
talent
and
virtue
as
well
as
infallible
dispensers
of
praise
and
blame

that

slew

david
his

saul
was
exceedingly
angry
and
this
word
was
displeasing
in
his
eyes
and
he
said
they
have
given
david
ten
thousand
and
to
me
they
have
given
but
a
thousand
and
saul
did
not
look
on
david
with
a
good

from
that
day
forward
and
saul
held
a
spear
in
his
hand
and
threw

to
nail

to

kings
thus
it
is
that

that

cassian
makes

a
religious
who
having
received
a
box
on
the
ear
from
his
abbot
in
presence
of
more
than
two
hundred
brethren
made
no
complaint
nor
even
changed
colour
gregory
praises
another
religious
who
having
been
struck
several
times
with
a
stool
by
his
abbot
attributed
it
not
to
the
passion
of
the
abbot
but
to
his
own
fault
he
adds
that
the
humility
and
patience
of
the
disciple
was
a
lesson
for
the
master
this
charity
will
have
no
small
weight
in
the
balance
of
him
who
weighs
merit
so
exactly
charity
gives
no
occasion
to
others
to
suffer
but
suffers
all
patiently
not
once
but
all
through
life
every
day
and
almost
every
hour
it
is
most
necessary
for
religious
as
not
being
able
to
seek
comfort
abroad
they
are
obliged
to
live
in
the
same
house
often
in
the
same
employment
with
characters
less
sympathetic
than
their
own
these
little
acts
of
charity
count
for
little
here
below
and
they
are
rather
exacted
than
admired
hence
there
is
less
danger
of
vainglory
and
all
their
merit
is
preserved
in
the

ascending

superiors
who
do
not
understand
the
excess
of
their
grief
and
whose
words
by
divine
permission
produce
no
effect
the
solemn
moment
of
agony
with
our
divine
saviour
was
that
in
which
abandoned
betrayed
and
denied
by
his
apostles
and
perceiving
in
his
father
only
an
irritated
face
he
exclaimed
my
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
such
will
be
for
religious
the
last
touch
which
will
complete
in
them
the
resemblance
of
jesus
crucified
provided
they
will
render
themselves
worthy
of
it
when
will
be
the
time
of
this
complete
abandonment
how
long
will
this
agony
be
prolonged
this
is
a
secret
known
only
to
god
xxxiii
conclusion
poverty
chastity
obedience
and
charity
such
are
the
virtues
suitable
and
characteristic
of
the
religious
in
this
little
treatise
we
have
endeavoured
to
trace
the
features
of
the
last
in
every
community
we
can
distinguish
two
sorts
of
religious
those
who
mount
and
those
who
descend
those
whose
face
is
towards
the
path
of
perfection
and
those
who
have
turned
their
back
to
it
perhaps
amongst
these
latter
some
have
only
one
more
step
to
abandon
it
altogether
now
we
mount
or
descend
proceed
or
retrace
our
steps
in
proportion
as
we
practise
these
four
virtues
or
neglect
them
a
religious
order
is
like
a
fire
balloon
which
requires
four
conditions
in
order
to
rise
into
the
clouds
amidst
the
applause
of
the
spectators
first
the
rarefaction
of
the
air
by
fire
this
represents
the
vow
of
poverty
which
empties
the
heart
through
the
hands
and
substitutes
the
desire
of
heavenly
goods
for
those
of
earth
second
release
from
the
cords
which
bind
it
down
this
represents
the
effects
of
the
vow
of
chastity
which
by
breaking
human
attachments
permits
us
to
soar
towards
god
with
freedom
and
rapidity
third
a
man
who
will
feed
the
fire
and
moderate
the
flight
of
the
balloon
upwards
this
represents
the
right
which
the
vow
of
obedience
places
in
the
hands
of
the
superior
to
nourish
the
sacred
fire
and
direct
the
sublime
movement
of
the
soul
and
foresee
dangers
fourth
the
union
of
its
component
parts
this
represents
the
operations
of
charity
in
causing
all
the
members
of
a
community
to
have
but
one
heart
and
one
soul
possessing
these
four
virtues
a
religious
order
soars
in
the
heights
of
perfection
but
if
one
of
these
be
wanting
it
falls
helplessly
and
is
no
longer
an
object
of
edification
but
of
scandal
and
ridicule
when
it
happens
that
some
members
losing
the
spirit
of
their
state
abandon
their
holy
vocation
we
may
say
with
john
they
went
out
from
us
but
they
were
not
of
us
for
if
they
had
been
of
us
they
would
no
doubt
have
continued
with
us
but
that
they
might
be
made
manifest
that
they
are
not
all
of
us
john
they
appeared
to
have
the
religious
virtues
but
in
reality
one
or
all
were
wanting
to
them
o
god
do
not
permit
that
lukewarmness
or
an
uncontrolled
passion
will
ever
make
me
waver
in
my
vocation
during
life
and
at
death
i
wish
to
remain
a
faithful
religious
so
that
i
may
find
the
salvation
which
thou
hast
promised
by
procuring
thy
glory
as
good
grain
improves
by
pulling
up
the
weeds
and
the
body
becomes
healthy
when
purged
of
bad
humours
pour
into
my
soul
the
grace
and
unction
which
others
refuse
in
order
that
practising
more
perfectly
from
day
to
day
poverty
chastity
obedience
and
charity
and
redoubling
my
ardour
and
zeal
to
my
last
hour
i
may
obtain
the
priceless
treasure
promised
to
those
who
have
quitted
all
to
follow
thee
amen

father
faber
often
reflect
on
some
good
point
in
each
of
your
brethren
reflect
on
the
opposite
faults
in
yourself
do
this
most
in
the
case
of
those
whom
we
are
most
inclined
to
criticize
never
claim
rights
or
even
let
ourselves
feel
that
we
have
them
as
this
spirit
is
most
fatal
both
to
obedience
and
charity
charitable
thoughts
are
the
only
security
of
charitable
deeds
and
words
they
save
us
from
surprises
especially
from
surprises
of
temper
never
have
an
aversion
for
another
much
less
manifest
it
avoid
particular
friendships
never
judge
another
always
if
possible
excuse
the
faults
we
see
and
if
we
can
not
excuse
the
action
excuse
the
intention
we
can
not
all
think
alike
and
we
should
therefore
avoid
attributing
bad
motives
to
others
charitable
religious
they
have
a
disregard
of
self
and
a
desire
to
accommodate
others
they
rejoice
with
their
companions
in
their
joys
and
recreations
and
grieve
with
them
in
their
afflictions
they
try
to
bring
all
the
good
they
can
to
the
community
and
to
avert
all
the
evil
they
begin
with
themselves
by
being
as
little
trouble
as
possible
to
others
with
great
charity
and
affability
they
bear
with
the
faults
and
shortcomings
of
others
careful
to
fulfil
the
law
of
christ
which
tells
us
to
bear
one
another
burdens
they
dispense
to
others
what
they
have
for
their
own
advantage
more
particularly
do
they
give
spiritual
assistance
by
prayer
and
the
other
spiritual
works
of
mercy
they
never
contradict
anyone
they
never
speak
against
anyone
they
are
convinced
that
charity
holy
friendships
and
concord
form
the
great
solace
of
this
life
and
that
no
good
ever
came
from
dissensions
and
disputes
they
consider
that
god
is
ever
in
the
midst
of
those
who
live
united
together
by
the
bonds
of
holy
love
we
will
do
likewise
if
we
consider
the
image
of
god
in
the
souls
of
our
brethren
as
we
form
one
body
here
and
one
spirit
in
the
same
faith
and
charity
let
us
hope
not
to
be
separated
hereafter
but
to
belong
for
ever
to
that
one
body
in
heaven
when
faith
and
hope
shall
disappear
but
where
charity
alone
shall
remain
and
remain
for
ever
