the
plum
tree
at
wittisham
several
of
the
little
houses
had
crept
down
very
close
to
the
river
prettyman
cottage
was
just
like
a
hive
made
for
the
habitation
of
some
gigantic
bee
its
pointed
roof
covered
with
deep
thatch
the
colour
of
a
donkey
hide
there
were
small
windows
under
the
overhanging
eaves
a
pathway
of
irregular
flat
stones
ran
up
to
the
doorway
and
a
bit
of
low
wall
divided
the
tiny
garden
from
the
river
the
plum
tree
grew
just
beside
the
wall
so
near
indeed
that
it
could
look
at
itself
on
spring
days
when
the
water
was
like
a
mirror
in
autumn
the
branches
on
that
side
of
the
tree
were
the
first
to
be
shaken
lest
any
of
the
fruit
should
fall
down
and
be
lost
sometimes
a
village
child
treading
cautiously
on
bare
toes
amongst
the
stones
along
the
narrow
margin
would
pounce
upon
a
plum
with
a
squeal
of
joy
for
although
the
village
was
surrounded
with
orchards
the
fruit
of
prettyman
tree
had
a
flavour
all
its
own
the
tree
had
been
given
to
her
by
a
nephew
who
was
a
gardener
in
a
great
fruit
orchard
in
the
north
and
her
husband
had
planted
and
tended
it
for
years
it
began
life
as
a
slender
thing
with
two
or
three
rods
of
branches
that
looked
as
if
the
first
wind
of
winter
would
blow
it
away
but
before
the
storms
came
it
had
begun
to
trust
itself
to
the
new
earth
and
to
root
itself
with
force
and
determination
there
were
good
soil
and
water
near
it
and
plenty
of
sunshine
and
as
is
the
way
of
nature
it
set
itself
to
do
its
own
business
at
all
seasons
unlike
the
distracted
heart
of
man
the
traffic
of
the
river
came
and
went
around
the
headland
the
big
ships
were
steering
in
or
going
out
to
sea
and
in
the
village
the
human
life
went
on
while
the
plum
tree
grew
high
enough
to
look
over
the
wall
its
stem
by
that
time
had
a
firm
footing
next
it
took
a
charming
bend
to
the
side
and
then
again
threw
out
new
branches
in
that
direction
it
turned
itself
from
the
prevailing
wind
throwing
a
new
grace
into
its
attitude
and
went
on
growing
returning
in
blossom
and
leaves
and
fruit
an
hundredfold
for
all
that
it
received
from
the
earth
and
the
sun
in
spring
it
was
enchanting
at
first
before
the
blossoms
came
out
with
small
bright
leaves
and
buds
like
pearls
heaped
upon
the
branches
then
later
when
the
whole
tree
was
white
imaged
like
a
bride
in
the
of
the
river
it
only
wanted
a
nightingale
to
sing
in
it
by
moonlight
there
were
no
nightingales
there
but
the
thrushes
sang
in
the
dawning
and
the
little
birds
whose
voices
were
sweet
and
thin
chirruped
about
it
in
crowds
while
the
larks
trilling
out
the
ardour
of
mating
time
sometimes
rose
from
their
nests
in
the
grass
and
soared
over
its
topmost
branches
on
their
skyward
flight
spring
therefore
was
its
merriest
time
for
then
every
would
cry
what
a
beautiful
tree
or
did
ye
ever
see
the
likes
of
it
there
were
a
few
days
of
inevitable
sadness
a
little
later
when
its
million
petals
fell
and
made
a
delicate
carpet
of
snow
on
the
ground
there
they
lay
in
a
kind
of
fairy
ring
as
if
there
had
been
a
shower
of
in
the
april
night
and
no
human
creature
would
have
dared
set
a
vandal
foot
on
that
magic
circle
and
mar
the
perfection
of
its
beauty
all
the
same
the
plum
tree
had
lost
its
petals
and
that
was
hard
to
bear
at
first
but
though
its
wittisham
neighbours
often
said
to
summer
trippers
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
it
in
blossom
the
plum
tree
did
not
repine
because
of
the
secrets
the
thousand
thousand
secrets
it
held
under
its
leaves
the
blossoms
were
but
a
promise
it
thought
and
soon
everybody
will
see
the
meaning
of
them
then
the
tiny
green
globes
began
to
appear
on
every
branch
and
twig
crowding
crowding
crowding
till
it
seemed
as
if
there
could
never
be
room
for
so
many
to
grow
but
the
weaker
ones
fell
from
the
boughs
or
were
blown
away
when
the
wind
was
fierce
so
the
plum
tree
felt
no
anxiety
knowing
that
it
was
built
for
a
large
family
the
little
green
globes
grew
and
grew
and
drank
in
sweet
and
swelled
and
when
the
summer
sun
touched
their
cheeks
all
day
they
flushed
and
reddened
till
when
august
came
the
tree
was
laden
with
purpling
fruit
fruit
so
tempting
that
its
rosy
beauty
had
sometimes
to
be
hidden
under
a
veil
of
grey
fishing
net
lest
the
myriad
it
had
made
during
the
summer
should
love
it
too
much
for
its
own
good
so
the
plum
tree
grew
and
flourished
taking
its
part
in
the
pageant
of
the
seasons
unaware
that
its
existence
was
to
be
interwoven
with
that
of
men
or
that
creatures
of
another
order
of
being
were
to
owe
some
changes
in
their
fortunes
to
its
silent
obedience
to
the
motive
of
life
ii
the
manor
house
the
long
low
drawing
room
of
the
manor
at
stoke
revel
was
the
warmest
and
most
genial
room
in
the
old
georgian
house
it
was
and
faced
south
and
even
on
this
morning
of
a
chilly
and
backward
spring
the
tentative
sunshine
of
april
had
contrived
to
put
out
the
fire
in
the
steel
grate
one
of
the
windows
opened
wide
to
the
garden
and
let
in
a
scent
which
was
less
of
flowers
than
of
the
promise
of
flowers
a
scent
of
earth
and
green
leaves
of
the
leafless
daphne
still
in
the
shrubbery
of
hyacinths
and
daffodils
and
tulips
and
primroses
still
sheathed
in
their
buds
and
awaiting
a
warmer
air
but
this
promise
of
spring
borne
into
the
room
by
the
wandering
breeze
from
the
river
was
nipped
as
it
were
by
the
frigid
spirit
of
age
and
formalism
in
its
living
occupants
de
tracy
a
lady
of
sat
at
her
her
companion
miss
smeardon
a
person
of
indeterminate
age
nursed
the
rupert
during
such
time
as
her
employer
was
too
deeply
engaged
to
fulfil
that
agreeable
duty
de
tracy
as
she
wrote
was
surrounded
by
countless
photographs
of
her
family
and
her
wide
connection
most
prominent
among
them
two
that
of
her
husband
admiral
de
tracy
who
had
died
many
years
ago
and
that
of
her
grandson
his
successor
whose
guardian
she
was
and
whose
minority
she
directed
her
eldest
son
the
father
of
this
boy
who
had
died
on
his
ship
off
the
coast
of
africa
his
wife
dead
too
these
many
years
her
other
sons
as
well
she
had
borne
four
their
wives
and
children
grown
men
fashionable
women
beautiful
children
fat
babies
the
likenesses
of
them
all
were
around
her
standing
amid
china
and
flowers
and
on
the
crowded
tables
and
of
the
not
inharmonious
and
yet
shabby
victorian
room
de
tracy
it
might
at
a
glance
be
seen
was
no
innovator
either
in
furniture
in
dress
or
probably
in
ideas
as
she
was
dressed
now
in
the
severely
simple
black
of
a
widow
so
she
had
been
dressed
when
she
first
mourned
admiral
de
tracy
the
muslin
ends
of
her
widow
cap
fell
upon
her
shoulders
and
its
border
rested
on
the
hard
lines
of
hair
which
framed
a
face
small
pale
aquiline
in
character
and
decidedly
austere
in
expression
she
took
one
from
a
docketed
pile
of
letters
and
held
it
up
under
her
glasses
the
sun
suddenly
striking
a
dazzle
of
blue
and
green
from
the
diamond
rings
on
her
small
withered
hands
then
she
read
it
aloud
to
her
companion
in
an
even
and
chilly
voice
she
had
read
it
before
in
the
same
way
at
the
same
hour
several
times
the
letter
couched
in
an
epistolary
style
largely
dependent
upon
underlining
appeared
to
contain
nevertheless
some
matter
of
moment
it
was
dated
from
eaton
square
in
london
some
weeks
before
and
signed
maria
spalding
her
mother
was
a
gallup
de
tracy
would
say
if
any
one
asked
who
maria
spalding
was
and
this
was
considered
sufficient
for
de
tracy
maiden
name
had
been
gallup
not
euphonious
but
nevertheless
aristocratic
my
dear
augusta
maria
spalding
wrote
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
help
me
out
of
a
there
is
no
beating
about
the
bush
you
know
that
cynthia
daughter
robinetta
loring
is
her
name
has
been
with
me
for
a
month
or
no
i
meant
to
have
had
her
for
a
part
of
the
season
and
to
her
if
possible
so
for
these
americans
to
learn
what
royalty
and
to
breathe
the
atmosphere
which
doth
hedge
a
as
shakespeare
says
and
which
they
can
never
of
course
in
a
country
like
theirs
i
know
you
ca
dear
augusta
and
you
will
blame
me
for
sentimentality
but
i
never
forget
what
a
creature
cynthia
was
before
she
ran
away
with
that
odious
american
and
my
friend
in
girlhood
too
you
must
remember
so
robinette
as
she
is
generally
called
has
come
to
my
house
as
a
but
a
most
thing
has
happened
i
have
had
influenza
so
badly
that
it
has
affected
my
an
old
trouble
i
am
ordered
to
nauheim
and
robinette
is
poor
dear
she
has
few
friends
in
london
and
certainly
none
who
can
put
her
up
tho
she
a
widow
she
is
only
just
very
pretty
and
really
tho
you
wo
believe
it
nice
i
am
and
just
wondering
if
you
would
let
be
and
receive
her
at
stoke
revel
she
has
set
her
heart
upon
seeing
the
place
and
some
she
was
called
after
i
ca
remember
it
so
it
ca
be
one
of
the
stoke
revel
group
a
i
fancy
and
on
paying
a
visit
to
lizzie
prettyman
her
mother
old
nurse
at
wittisham
over
the
river
she
her
mother
she
would
do
this
and
such
a
promise
is
do
you
think
it
such
an
story
now
cynthia
american
marriage
and
no
fault
of
poor
dear
child
her
wish
is
almost
a
one
do
you
agree
to
pay
respect
to
her
mother
memory
and
the
family
and
is
to
be
encouraged
in
these
days
of
radicalism
when
every
natural
tie
is
loosened
and
people
pay
no
more
to
their
parents
than
if
they
had
any
but
had
made
themselves
and
brought
themselves
up
from
the
beginning
so
do
you
think
it
a
thing
to
encourage
the
kind
of
feeling
in
robinette
especially
as
she
is
an
you
know
de
tracy
paused
and
replaced
the
letter
in
the
package
from
which
she
had
withdrawn
it
maria
spalding
point
of
view
she
observed
has
i
confess
helped
me
to
overcome
the
extreme
reluctance
i
felt
to
receive
the
child
of
that
american
here
cynthia
de
tracy
elopement
nearly
broke
my
dear
husband
heart
she
was
the
apple
of
his
eye
before
our
marriage
so
much
younger
than
himself
that
she
was
like
his
child
rather
than
his
sister
what
a
shock
it
must
have
been
murmured
the
companion
what
ingratitude
can
you
really
receive
her
child
of
course
you
know
best
de
tracy
but
it
seems
a
risk
hardly
a
risk
rejoined
de
tracy
with
dignity
but
it
is
a
trial
to
me
and
an
effort
that
i
scarcely
feel
called
upon
to
make
miss
smeardon
was
so
well
versed
in
her
duties
that
she
knew
she
always
had
to
urge
her
employer
to
do
exactly
what
she
most
wanted
to
do
and
the
poor
creature
had
developed
a
really
wonderful
ingenuity
in
divining
what
these
wishes
were
just
now
however
she
was
to
use
a
sporting
phrase
at
fault
for
a
minute
she
could
not
exactly
tell
whether
de
tracy
wanted
to
be
urged
to
ask
her
niece
to
stoke
revel
or
whether
she
wanted
to
be
supplied
with
a
really
plausible
excuse
for
not
doing
so
those
of
you
who
have
seen
a
hound
at
fault
can
imagine
the
companion
at
this
moment
irresolute
tense
desperately
anxious
to
find
and
follow
up
the
right
scent
compromise
that
useful
refuge
came
to
her
aid
it
difficult
to
know
she
faltered
then
de
tracy
gave
her
the
lead
maria
spalding
is
right
when
she
says
that
my
husband
niece
contemplates
a
duty
in
visiting
stoke
revel
she
announced
the
young
woman
is
the
lawful
daughter
of
cynthia
de
tracy
that
was
our
solicitors
could
never
discover
anything
dubious
in
the
marriage
though
we
long
suspected
it
therefore
though
i
never
could
have
invited
her
here
i
admit
that
the
admiral
niece
has
a
right
to
come
in
a
way
though
her
maiden
name
was
bean
ejaculated
the
companion
almost
under
her
breath
there
are
pease
in
the
north
as
everyone
knows
perhaps
there
are
beans
somewhere
there
have
never
been
beans
said
de
tracy
solemnly
and
totally
unconscious
of
a
pun
look
for
yourself
miss
smeardon
did
not
need
to
rise
from
her
seat
and
fetch
burke
it
lay
always
close
at
hand
she
merely
lifted
it
on
to
her
knee
and
ran
her
finger
down
the
names
beginning
with
beaton
beare
beatty
beale
she
read
out
and
she
shook
her
head
in
dismal
triumph
but
never
a
bean
no
we
english
have
no
such
dreadful
names
thank
heavens
this
is
the
beginning
of
april
pursued
de
tracy
referring
to
a
maria
spalding
course
at
nauheim
will
take
three
weeks
we
must
allow
her
a
week
for
going
and
coming
during
that
time
david
loring
can
be
my
guest
a
whole
month
cried
the
companion
as
though
in
ecstasy
at
her
employer
generosity
a
whole
month
at
stoke
revel
de
tracy
took
no
notice
write
in
my
name
to
maria
spalding
please
she
commanded
be
sure
that
there
is
no
mistake
about
dates
mention
the
departure
and
arrival
of
trains
and
say
that
david
loring
will
find
a
fly
at
the
station
that
is
all
i
think
the
companion
bent
officiously
forward
you
remember
of
course
that
young
lavendar
comes
down
next
week
upon
business
well
what
if
he
does
asked
de
tracy
shortly
david
loring
is
a
widow
murmured
the
companion
darkly
a
young
american
widow
and
they
are
said
to
be
so
dangerous
de
tracy
drew
herself
up
do
you
insinuate
that
the
niece
will
lay
herself
out
to
attract
lavendar
a
widow
in
the
house
of
a
widow
you
go
rather
too
far
miss
smeardon
though
you
are
speaking
of
an
american
besides
allusions
of
this
character
are
extremely
distasteful
to
me
i
have
been
told
that
the
minds
of
unmarried
women
are
always
running
upon
love
affairs
but
i
should
hardly
have
thought
it
of
you
i
sure
i
never
imagined
any
about
myself
murmured
miss
smeardon
with
the
pitiable
writhe
of
the
worm
i
should
suppose
not
rejoined
de
tracy
gravely
and
the
companion
took
up
her
pen
obediently
to
write
to
maria
spalding
shall
i
send
your
love
to
the
admiral
niece
she
humbly
enquired
or
or
something
of
the
kind
there
was
irony
in
the
last
phrase
but
it
was
quite
unconscious
not
my
love
replied
de
tracy
some
suitable
message
make
no
mistake
about
the
dates
remember
thus
a
letter
containing
dates
and
though
not
love
the
substitute
described
by
miss
smeardon
as
something
of
the
kind
for
an
unwanted
niece
from
an
unknown
aunt
left
stoke
revel
by
the
afternoon
post
and
reached
robinette
loring
at
breakfast
next
morning
iii
young
loring
young
loring
thought
she
had
never
taken
so
long
a
drive
as
that
from
the
weston
railway
station
to
stoke
revel
the
way
stretched
through
narrow
winding
roads
always
up
hill
always
between
high
devonshire
hedges
the
lanes
were
slippery
and
she
was
unpleasantly
conscious
of
the
size
and
weight
of
the
american
wardrobe
trunk
that
reared
its
mighty
frame
in
front
of
her
almost
to
the
of
the
driver
who
steadied
it
with
one
hand
as
he
plied
the
whip
with
the
other
it
struck
her
humorously
that
the
trunk
was
larger
than
most
of
the
cottages
they
were
passing
it
was
a
late
spring
that
year
in
england
robinette
was
a
and
did
not
know
that
england
runs
to
late
and
wet
springs
believing
that
they
make
more
conversation
than
early
fine
ones
and
the
trees
were
just
bursting
into
leaf
the
sun
had
not
shone
for
three
days
and
the
landscape
for
all
its
beautiful
greenness
looked
gloomy
to
an
eye
accustomed
to
a
good
deal
of
crude
sunshine
as
the
horse
mounted
higher
and
higher
robinette
glanced
out
of
the
windows
at
the
dripping
boughs
and
her
face
lost
something
of
its
sparkle
of
anticipation
she
had
little
to
expect
in
the
way
of
a
warm
welcome
she
knew
that
or
at
least
her
mind
knew
it
but
heart
always
expected
surprises
although
she
had
lived
two
and
twenty
summers
and
was
a
widow
at
that
her
mother
had
been
a
de
tracy
of
stoke
revel
whose
connection
with
that
ancient
family
had
ceased
abruptly
when
she
met
an
american
architect
while
traveling
on
the
continent
married
him
out
of
hand
and
went
to
his
native
new
england
with
him
the
de
tracys
had
no
opinion
of
america
its
government
its
institutions
its
customs
or
its
people
and
when
they
learned
that
cynthia
de
tracy
had
not
only
allied
herself
with
this
undesirable
nation
but
had
selected
a
native
by
the
name
of
harold
bean
they
regarded
the
incident
of
the
marriage
as
closed
the
union
had
been
a
happy
one
though
the
de
tracys
of
stoke
revel
had
always
regarded
the
unfortunately
named
architect
more
as
a
vegetable
than
a
human
being
and
the
daughter
of
the
marriage
was
the
young
loring
now
driving
in
the
station
fly
to
the
home
of
her
mother
people
her
father
had
died
when
she
was
fifteen
and
her
mother
followed
three
years
after
leaving
her
with
a
respectable
fortune
but
no
relations
the
entire
family
happily
de
tracy
would
have
said
having
died
out
with
harold
robinette
was
unspeakably
lonely
even
with
her
hundred
friends
for
there
was
enough
english
blood
in
her
to
make
her
cry
out
inwardly
for
kith
and
kin
for
family
ties
for
all
the
dear
familiar
backgrounds
of
hearth
and
home
had
a
welcoming
hand
been
stretched
across
the
sea
she
would
have
flown
at
once
to
make
acquaintance
with
the
de
tracys
cold
and
indifferent
as
they
had
always
been
but
no
bidding
ever
came
and
the
picture
of
the
manor
house
of
stoke
revel
on
her
was
the
only
reminder
of
her
connection
with
that
ancient
and
honourable
house
it
is
not
difficult
to
see
under
the
circumstances
how
the
robinette
became
the
wife
of
the
first
man
in
whom
she
inspired
a
serious
passion
it
is
incredible
that
women
should
confuse
the
passive
process
of
being
loved
with
the
active
process
of
loving
but
it
occurs
nevertheless
and
robinette
drifted
into
marriage
with
the
vaguest
possible
notions
of
what
it
meant
feeling
and
knowing
that
she
needed
something
and
supposing
it
must
be
a
husband
it
was
better
fortune
perhaps
than
she
merited
and
equally
kind
for
both
parties
that
her
husband
died
before
either
of
them
realized
the
tragic
mistake
david
loring
was
too
absorbed
in
his
own
emotions
to
note
the
absence
of
full
response
on
the
part
of
his
wife
robinette
was
too
much
a
child
and
too
inexperienced
to
be
conscious
of
her
own
lack
of
feeling
it
was
death
not
life
that
opened
her
eyes
when
david
loring
lay
in
his
coffin
robinette
heart
was
suddenly
seized
with
growing
pains
her
vision
widened
words
and
promises
took
on
a
new
and
larger
meaning
and
she
became
a
serious
woman
for
her
years
although
there
was
an
ineradicable
gaiety
of
spirit
in
her
that
needed
only
sunshine
to
make
it
the
dominant
note
of
her
nature
at
the
moment
robinette
in
the
station
fly
on
her
way
to
stoke
revel
was
only
in
the
making
although
she
herself
considered
her
life
as
practically
finished
the
past
and
the
present
were
moulding
her
into
something
that
only
the
future
could
determine
sometimes
april
sometimes
july
sometimes
witch
sometimes
woman
impetuous
intrepid
romantic
tempestuous
illogical
these
were
but
the
elements
of
which
the
coming
years
of
experience
had
yet
to
shape
a
character
young
loring
had
plenty
of
briars
but
she
had
good
roots
and
in
favorable
soil
would
be
certain
to
bear
roses
but
in
the
immediate
present
the
fly
with
the
immense
american
wardrobe
trunk
beside
the
driver
turned
into
the
avenue
of
stoke
revel
and
david
loring
bestowed
upon
herself
those
little
feminine
attentions
which
precede
arrival
pattings
of
the
hair
behind
the
ears
twitches
of
the
veil
and
pullings
down
about
the
waist
and
sleeves
a
little
toy
of
a
purse
made
of
golden
chainwork
hanging
from
her
wrist
was
searched
for
the
driver
fare
and
it
had
hardly
snapped
to
again
when
the
fly
drew
up
before
the
entrance
to
the
house
how
interesting
it
looked
robinette
put
her
head
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
gazed
up
at
the
long
row
of
windows
the
old
stones
and
the
carved
front
of
the
building
here
was
a
house
where
things
might
happen
she
thought
and
her
young
heart
gave
a
sudden
bound
of
anticipation
but
the
door
was
shut
alas
and
a
blank
feeling
came
over
robinette
as
she
looked
at
it
some
one
perhaps
would
come
out
and
welcome
her
she
thought
for
a
brief
moment
but
only
the
butler
appeared
who
with
the
formal
announcement
of
her
name
ushered
her
into
a
long
low
room
with
a
row
of
windows
on
one
side
and
a
pleasant
look
of
comfort
and
habitation
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
with
a
steaming
urn
upon
it
heard
the
furious
barking
of
a
little
dog
saw
that
there
were
two
figures
in
the
room
and
moved
instinctively
towards
the
one
beside
the
window
the
figure
in
weeds
neither
very
tall
nor
very
imposing
yet
somehow
formidable
how
do
you
do
said
an
icy
voice
and
a
chill
hand
held
hers
for
a
moment
but
did
not
press
it
the
colour
in
robinette
cheeks
paled
and
then
rushed
back
as
she
drew
herself
up
unconsciously
i
am
very
well
thank
you
aunt
de
tracy
she
answered
with
commendable
composure
this
is
my
friend
and
companion
miss
smeardon
continued
de
tracy
advancing
to
the
where
that
useful
personage
officiated
david
loring
miss
smeardon
miss
smeardon
had
the
dog
upon
her
lap
yapping
clashing
his
teeth
together
and
obviously
thirsting
for
the
visitor
blood
he
was
quieted
with
soothing
words
and
robinette
seated
herself
innocently
in
the
nearest
chair
beside
the
table
excuse
me
the
companion
said
with
a
slight
cough
de
chair
do
you
mind
taking
another
there
was
something
disagreeable
in
her
voice
and
in
de
tracy
deliberate
scrutiny
something
so
nearly
insulting
that
a
childish
impulse
to
cry
then
and
there
suddenly
seized
upon
robinette
this
was
her
mother
home
and
no
kiss
had
welcomed
her
to
it
no
kind
word
there
were
perfunctory
questions
about
her
journey
references
to
the
coldness
and
lateness
of
the
spring
enquiries
after
the
health
of
maria
spalding
whose
mother
was
a
gallup
but
no
claiming
of
kinship
no
naming
of
her
mother
name
nor
of
her
native
country
robinette
ardent
spirit
had
felt
sorrow
but
it
had
never
met
rebuff
nor
known
injustice
and
the
sudden
stir
of
revolt
at
her
heart
was
painful
with
an
almost
physical
pain
after
a
long
drawn
hour
of
this
social
torture
de
tracy
rang
and
a
elderly
maid
appeared
show
loring
to
her
room
benson
said
the
mistress
of
the
house
and
help
her
to
unpack
robinette
followed
her
conductor
upstairs
with
a
sinking
heart
oh
but
the
chill
of
this
english
spring
was
in
her
bones
and
the
coldness
of
a
reception
so
frigid
that
her
passionate
young
spirit
almost
rebelled
on
the
spot
prompting
wild
ideas
and
impulsive
impossibilities
even
a
flight
to
her
mother
old
nurse
to
lizzie
prettyman
so
often
lovingly
described
with
her
little
thatched
cottage
beyond
the
river
surely
she
would
find
the
welcome
there
that
was
lacking
here
and
the
touch
of
human
kindness
that
one
craved
in
a
foreign
land
but
no
robinette
called
to
her
aid
her
strong
american
common
sense
and
the
grit
that
her
countrymen
admire
was
she
to
confess
herself
routed
in
the
very
first
onset
the
very
first
attempt
in
storming
the
ancestral
stronghold
with
a
characteristically
quick
return
of
hope
the
admiral
niece
exclaimed
certainly
not
iv
a
chilly
reception
benson
approached
the
wardrobe
trunk
with
the
air
of
a
person
who
has
taken
an
immediate
and
violent
dislike
to
an
object
we
have
all
looked
at
your
box
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
we
are
not
sure
that
it
is
set
up
properly
it
is
very
different
from
any
we
have
ever
seen
at
the
manor
and
the
men
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
it
up
to
the
room
i
fancy
it
is
upside
down
is
it
not
no
we
rather
thought
it
was
i
would
call
the
boy
to
unlock
it
but
he
jammed
his
hand
in
attempting
to
force
the
catches
and
i
thought
you
would
be
kind
enough
to
instruct
me
how
to
open
it
perhaps
i
am
quite
able
to
do
it
myself
said
robinette
keeping
down
a
hysterical
laugh
see
how
easily
it
goes
when
you
know
the
secret
and
she
deftly
turned
her
key
in
two
locks
one
after
the
other
let
down
the
mysterious
façade
of
the
affair
and
pulled
out
an
extraordinary
rack
on
which
hung
so
many
dresses
and
wraps
that
benson
lost
her
breath
in
surprise
would
you
like
me
to
carry
some
of
your
things
into
another
room
she
asked
they
will
never
go
in
the
wardrobe
it
is
only
a
plain
english
wardrobe
we
have
never
had
any
american
guests
the
things
need
be
moved
said
robinette
many
of
them
will
be
quite
convenient
where
they
are
and
now
you
need
not
trouble
about
me
i
am
well
used
to
helping
myself
if
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
come
in
just
before
dinner
for
a
moment
benson
disappeared
below
stairs
where
she
regaled
the
injured
boy
and
the
female
servants
with
the
first
instalment
of
what
was
destined
to
be
the
most
dramatic
and
sensational
serial
story
ever
told
at
the
manor
house
the
lid
of
the
box
do
lift
up
she
explained
like
all
the
box
lids
as
ever
i
saw
and
me
with
lady
chitterton
for
six
years
traveling
constantly
the
front
of
the
thing
splits
in
the
middle
and
the
bottom
half
falls
on
the
floor
a
heathenish
kind
of
tray
lifts
off
from
its
hinges
like
a
door
and
a
clothes
rack
pulls
out
on
runners
is
a
sight
to
curdle
your
blood
and
the
number
of
dresses
she
brought
would
make
her
out
to
be
richer
than
crusoe
though
i
have
heard
from
a
cousin
of
mine
who
was
in
service
in
america
that
the
ladies
over
there
spend
every
penny
they
can
rake
and
scrape
on
their
clothes
their
husbands
may
work
their
fingers
to
the
bone
and
their
parents
be
in
the
workhouse
but
fine
frocks
they
will
have
rather
said
the
boy
nursing
his
injured
thumb
on
the
departure
of
benson
from
her
room
robinette
gave
a
stifled
shriek
in
which
laughter
and
tears
were
equally
mingled
then
she
flew
like
a
lapwing
to
the
and
lifted
off
a
fan
of
white
paper
from
the
grate
no
possibility
of
help
there
she
exclaimed
cold
within
cold
without
how
shall
i
unpack
how
shall
i
dress
how
shall
i
live
without
a
fire
ah
here
is
the
coal
box
empty
empty
and
it
is
only
the
month
of
april
to
be
in
england
now
that
april
there
how
could
browning
write
that
line
without
his
teeth
chattering
how
well
i
understand
the
desire
of
the
british
to
keep
india
and
south
africa
they
must
have
some
place
to
go
where
they
can
get
warm
now
for
unpacking
or
any
sort
of
manual
labour
which
will
put
my
frozen
blood
in
circulation
slapping
her
hands
beating
her
breast
stamping
her
feet
loring
removed
a
few
dresses
from
the
offending
trunk
to
the
mahogany
wardrobe
and
disposed
her
effects
neatly
in
the
drawers
of
bureau
and
highboy
i
have
made
a
mistake
at
the
very
beginning
she
thought
i
supposed
nothing
could
be
too
pretty
for
the
manor
house
and
now
i
am
afraid
my
worst
is
too
fine
the
manor
house
of
stoke
revel
that
appeal
to
anyone
imagination
now
what
for
white
satin
with
crystal
back
you
go
into
the
trunk
back
goes
the
silver
grey
chiffon
i
have
it
over
flannel
avaunt
heliotrope
velvet
with
amethyst
spangles
made
with
a
view
to
ensnaring
the
high
church
clergy
i
wish
i
had
a
princess
dress
of
moleskin
with
a
court
train
of
squirrel
hanging
from
the
shoulders
here
is
the
thing
my
black
liberty
satin
two
years
old
i
will
cover
part
of
my
exposed
neck
and
shoulders
with
a
fichu
of
lace
my
black
silk
openwork
stockings
will
be
drawn
on
over
a
pair
of
balbriggans
and
the
number
of
petticoats
i
shall
don
would
discourage
a
scotch
fishwife
i
write
spalding
maid
to
buy
me
two
bottles
mittens
a
box
of
quinine
tablets
and
a
shetland
shawl
what
are
these
retire
into
the
depths
of
that
tray
and
never
look
me
in
the
face
again
i
wonder
at
your
impertinence
in
coming
here
i
shall
give
you
cod
liver
oil
and
make
you
grow
into
umbrellas
presently
the
dinner
gong
growled
through
the
house
and
robinette
still
shivering
flung
across
her
shoulders
a
shimmering
scarf
of
white
and
silver
it
fell
over
her
simple
black
dress
in
just
the
right
way
adding
a
last
touch
to
the
somewhat
exotic
grace
which
made
her
a
stranger
in
her
mother
home
then
she
fled
down
the
darkening
passages
instinctively
aware
that
unpunctuality
was
a
crime
in
this
house
yet
in
spite
of
her
haste
she
paused
before
the
window
of
an
upper
lobby
arrested
by
the
scene
it
framed
heavy
rain
still
fell
and
the
light
made
greenish
by
the
nearness
of
great
trees
just
coming
into
leaf
was
cheerless
and
singularly
cold
but
that
could
not
mar
the
majesty
of
the
outlook
which
made
the
manor
of
stoke
revel
on
its
height
unique
far
below
the
house
the
broad
river
slipped
towards
the
sea
between
woods
that
rose
tier
upon
tier
above
and
beyond
woods
of
beech
and
of
oak
not
yet
green
but
purplish
under
the
rainy
mist
on
the
bank
woods
too
and
here
where
the
river
in
excess
of
strength
swirled
into
a
creek
a
shining
where
fishing
nets
were
hung
then
the
low
strong
tower
of
a
church
with
the
sombreness
of
cypress
beside
it
and
the
thatched
roofs
of
cottages
something
stirred
in
the
heart
of
robinette
as
she
looked
that
part
of
her
blood
which
her
english
mother
had
given
her
this
scene
so
indescribably
english
as
hardly
to
be
imaginable
in
another
land
had
been
painted
for
her
again
and
again
by
her
mother
with
all
the
retrospective
romance
of
an
exile
touch
she
knew
it
but
she
did
not
know
if
she
could
ever
love
it
beautiful
though
it
was
and
noble
but
she
banished
these
misgivings
and
ran
down
the
twisted
stairway
so
fast
that
she
was
almost
panting
when
she
reached
the
door
i
will
take
your
arm
please
said
the
hostess
coldly
while
miss
smeardon
wore
the
virtuous
and
injured
air
of
one
who
has
been
kept
waiting
de
tracy
laid
on
the
warm
and
smooth
arm
of
her
guest
one
of
her
small
dry
hands
sparkling
with
rings
and
the
procession
closed
with
the
companion
and
the
in
the
dining
room
the
shutters
were
closed
and
the
candles
in
branching
candlesticks
of
silver
only
partially
lit
a
room
long
and
low
like
the
other
the
walls
were
darkened
with
pictures
and
robinette
bright
eyes
searched
them
eagerly
the
sir
joshua
is
not
here
she
thought
and
it
was
not
in
the
drawing
room
has
aunt
de
tracy
given
or
hidden
it
away
my
very
own
with
all
her
determination
robinette
somehow
could
not
summon
courage
enough
to
ask
where
this
picture
was
such
a
question
would
involve
the
mention
of
her
mother
name
and
from
that
she
shrank
young
loring
had
never
before
found
herself
in
a
society
where
conversation
was
apparently
regarded
as
a
crime
and
to
fit
herself
to
her
environment
under
the
scrutiny
of
de
tracy
and
the
decidedly
inimical
looks
of
the
companion
took
all
her
time
a
burden
of
lay
upon
her
such
as
her
light
and
elastic
spirit
had
never
known
she
found
herself
morbidly
observant
of
minute
details
the
pattern
of
the
tablecloth
the
crest
upon
the
spoons
the
curious
red
knobs
upon
miss
smeardon
fingers
and
the
odd
mincing
way
she
held
her
fork
the
almost
athletic
efforts
of
the
butler
when
he
raised
an
enormous
silver
and
the
curiously
frugal
and
unappetizing
nature
of
the
viand
it
disclosed
the
wizened
face
of
the
too
peering
over
the
table
edge
out
of
miss
lap
might
have
acquired
its
distrustful
expression
robinette
thought
from
habitual
doubts
as
to
whether
enough
to
eat
would
ever
be
his
good
fortune
the
meal
ended
with
the
ceremonious
presentation
to
each
lady
in
turn
of
three
wrinkled
apples
and
two
crooked
bananas
in
a
probably
priceless
dish
of
crown
derby
then
the
procession
and
returned
to
the
drawing
room
and
the
evening
and
the
morning
were
the
first
day
sighed
robinette
to
herself
in
the
chilly
solitude
of
her
own
room
how
often
could
she
endure
the
repetition
v
at
wittisham
may
i
have
a
fire
to
dress
by
benson
robinette
asked
rather
timidly
that
night
her
head
just
peeping
above
the
blankets
returned
benson
in
italics
with
an
interrogation
point
robinette
longed
to
spell
the
word
and
ask
benson
if
it
had
ever
come
to
her
notice
before
but
she
stifled
her
desire
and
said
i
am
quite
ashamed
benson
but
you
see
i
am
not
used
to
the
climate
yet
if
you
pamper
me
just
a
little
at
the
beginning
i
shall
behave
better
presently
i
will
give
orders
for
a
fire
night
and
morning
certainly
said
benson
i
did
not
offer
it
because
our
ladies
never
have
one
in
their
bedrooms
at
this
time
of
the
year
de
tracy
is
very
strong
and
active
for
her
age
it
my
opinion
she
a
remarked
benson
at
the
luncheon
table
she
asks
for
what
she
wants
like
a
child
she
has
a
pretty
way
with
her
i
ca
deny
that
but
is
she
a
wheedler
or
not
robinette
got
her
fire
to
dress
by
and
so
was
able
to
come
down
in
the
morning
feeling
tolerably
warm
it
was
well
that
she
was
for
the
cold
tea
and
tough
toast
of
the
de
tracy
breakfast
had
little
in
them
to
warm
the
heart
conversation
languished
during
the
meal
and
after
a
walk
to
the
stables
robinette
was
thankful
to
return
to
her
own
room
again
on
the
pretext
of
writing
letters
there
she
piled
up
the
fire
drew
her
chair
close
up
to
the
hearth
and
employed
herself
until
noon
when
she
took
her
embroidery
and
joined
her
aunt
in
the
drawing
room
luncheon
was
announced
at
half
past
one
and
immediately
after
it
de
tracy
and
miss
smeardon
went
to
their
respective
bedrooms
for
rest
are
there
indeed
only
twelve
hours
in
the
day
robinette
asked
herself
desperately
as
she
heard
the
great
hall
clock
strike
two
it
seemed
quite
impossible
that
it
could
be
only
two
the
whole
afternoon
had
still
to
be
accounted
for
and
how
well
she
might
look
over
her
clothes
again
them
in
all
their
dainty
variety
in
the
wardrobe
and
drawers
she
might
put
tissue
paper
into
the
sleeves
of
each
bodice
smoothing
out
every
crease
she
might
even
find
that
some
tiny
repairs
were
needed
there
were
three
new
hats
and
several
pairs
of
new
gloves
to
be
tried
on
her
accounts
must
be
made
up
her
cheque
book
balanced
yet
all
these
things
would
take
but
a
short
time
then
the
hall
clock
struck
three
i
must
go
out
she
thought
coming
through
the
hall
from
her
room
robinette
met
her
aunt
and
miss
smeardon
descending
the
staircase
we
are
driving
this
afternoon
said
de
tracy
would
you
not
like
to
come
with
us
the
thought
turned
robinette
to
stone
she
had
visited
the
stables
and
seen
the
coachman
lead
what
seemed
to
her
a
palsied
horse
out
into
the
yard
her
sympathetic
allusion
to
the
supposed
condition
of
the
steed
had
not
been
well
received
for
the
man
had
given
her
to
understand
that
this
was
the
one
horse
of
the
establishment
but
robinette
had
vowed
never
to
sit
behind
it
i
think
i
rather
walk
aunt
de
tracy
she
said
i
like
to
go
and
see
my
mother
old
nurse
prettyman
can
i
do
any
errands
for
you
none
thank
you
to
go
to
wittisham
you
have
to
cross
the
ferry
remember
oh
that
must
be
simple
you
may
be
sure
i
shall
not
lose
myself
said
robinette
both
the
older
women
looked
curiously
at
her
for
a
moment
then
de
tracy
said
you
will
kindly
not
use
the
public
ferry
the
footman
will
row
you
across
to
wittisham
at
any
hour
you
may
mention
to
him
oh
but
aunt
de
tracy
i
really
prefer
the
public
ferry
nonsense
impossible
the
footman
shall
row
you
said
de
tracy
with
finality
robinette
said
nothing
she
hated
the
idea
of
the
footman
but
it
seemed
inevitable
am
i
never
to
get
away
from
their
dullnesses
she
thought
a
public
ferry
sounds
quite
lively
in
place
of
being
rowed
by
william
when
the
shore
was
reached
however
robinette
discovered
that
the
passage
across
the
river
in
a
leaky
little
boat
rowed
by
a
painfully
inexperienced
servant
was
almost
too
much
for
her
to
see
him
fumbling
with
the
oars
made
her
tingle
to
take
them
herself
she
could
not
abide
the
irritation
of
a
return
journey
with
such
a
boatman
this
determination
was
hastened
when
she
saw
that
instead
of
the
steamer
of
her
native
land
the
ferry
at
wittisham
was
just
like
an
ordinary
that
one
rang
a
bell
hanging
from
a
picturesque
tower
that
a
nice
young
man
with
a
sprig
of
wallflower
in
his
cap
rowed
one
across
and
that
each
passenger
handed
out
a
penny
to
him
on
the
farther
side
how
enchantingly
quaint
she
cried
william
you
can
go
home
i
shall
return
by
the
public
ferry
william
looked
surprised
but
only
replied
very
good
on
warm
summer
afternoons
the
tiny
square
of
prettyman
garden
made
as
delightful
a
place
to
sit
in
as
one
could
wish
there
was
sunshine
on
the
turf
and
a
thin
shade
was
cast
by
the
drooping
boughs
of
the
plum
tree
just
enough
to
shelter
old
eyes
from
the
glare
when
she
was
very
tired
with
doing
her
work
prettyman
would
totter
out
into
the
garden
she
was
getting
terribly
lame
now
yet
afraid
to
acknowledge
it
knowing
with
the
desperate
wisdom
of
poverty
that
once
to
give
in
very
often
ended
in
giving
up
altogether
so
her
lameness
was
on
the
weather
on
scrubbing
the
floor
blamed
on
anything
rather
than
the
tragic
incurable
fact
of
old
age
this
afternoon
her
rheumatism
had
been
specially
bad
she
had
an
inclination
to
cry
out
when
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
every
step
was
an
effort
yet
the
sunshine
was
tempting
it
warmed
old
and
aching
bones
through
and
through
as
no
fire
could
do
and
prettyman
thought
she
must
make
the
effort
to
go
out
she
had
just
arrived
at
this
conclusion
when
a
tap
came
to
the
door
that
you
mrs
darke
she
called
out
in
her
piping
old
voice
come
in
me
dear
i
that
stiff
with
me
rheumatics
i
ca
scarce
rise
out
of
me
chair
it
not
darke
said
robinette
stooping
to
enter
through
the
tiny
doorway
it
a
stranger
prettyman
come
all
the
way
from
america
to
see
you
lor
now
miss
whoever
may
you
be
the
old
woman
cried
making
as
if
she
would
rise
from
her
chair
but
robinette
caught
her
arm
and
made
her
sit
still
do
get
up
please
sit
right
there
where
you
are
and
i
take
this
chair
beside
you
now
prettyman
look
at
me
hard
and
tell
me
if
you
know
who
i
am
the
old
woman
gazed
into
robinette
face
and
then
a
light
seemed
to
break
over
her
it
miss
cynthia
daughter
you
are
she
cried
my
miss
cynthia
as
went
and
married
in
america
she
caught
robinette
white
ringed
hands
in
hers
and
robinette
bent
down
and
kissed
the
wrinkled
old
face
i
know
that
mother
loved
you
nurse
she
said
she
used
often
often
to
tell
me
about
you
after
the
fashion
of
old
people
prettyman
was
too
much
moved
to
speak
her
face
worked
all
over
and
then
slow
tears
began
to
run
down
her
furrowed
cheeks
she
got
up
from
her
chair
and
walked
across
the
uneven
floor
leaning
on
a
stick
i
something
here
miss
i
something
here
something
i
never
parts
with
she
said
a
tall
chest
of
drawers
stood
against
the
wall
and
the
old
woman
began
to
search
among
its
contents
as
she
spoke
at
last
she
found
a
little
kid
shoe
laid
away
in
a
handkerchief
see
here
miss
here
my
miss
cynthia
shoe
was
tied
on
to
my
wedding
coach
the
day
i
got
married
and
left
her
my
laughed
at
me
cruel
because
i
have
that
shoe
with
me
but
i
kept
it
ever
since
robinette
came
and
stood
beside
her
and
they
both
wept
together
over
the
silly
little
shoe
i
want
to
talk
a
great
deal
to
you
nurse
i
want
to
tell
you
all
about
mother
and
father
and
how
they
died
said
robinette
through
her
tears
how
strange
that
she
should
have
to
come
to
this
cottage
and
to
this
poor
old
woman
before
she
found
anyone
to
whom
she
could
speak
of
her
beloved
dead
her
heart
was
so
full
that
she
could
scarcely
speak
a
crowd
of
memories
rushed
into
her
mind
last
scenes
and
parting
words
those
innumerable
unforgettable
details
that
are
printed
once
for
all
upon
the
heart
that
loves
and
feels
i
like
to
tell
you
about
it
out
of
doors
nurse
dear
she
said
tearfully
can
you
come
out
under
the
plum
tree
in
your
garden
lovely
there
yes
dearie
yes
we
come
out
under
the
plum
tree
we
will
echoed
prettyman
see
nursie
take
my
arm
i
help
you
out
into
the
warm
sunshine
robinette
said
they
progressed
very
slowly
the
old
woman
leaning
with
all
her
weight
upon
the
arm
of
her
strong
young
helper
then
under
the
flickering
shade
of
the
tree
they
sat
down
together
for
their
talk
so
much
to
tell
so
much
to
hear
the
afternoon
slipped
away
unknown
to
them
and
still
they
were
sitting
there
hand
in
hand
talking
and
listening
sometimes
crying
a
little
sometimes
laughing
a
queerly
assorted
couple
these
friends
but
when
all
the
recollections
had
been
talked
over
and
wept
over
when
prettyman
had
told
robinette
with
the
extraordinary
detail
that
old
people
can
put
into
their
memories
of
long
ago
all
that
she
remembered
of
cynthia
de
tracy
childhood
then
robinette
began
to
question
the
old
woman
about
her
own
life
was
she
comfortable
was
she
tolerably
well
off
or
had
she
difficulty
in
making
ends
meet
to
these
questions
prettyman
made
valiant
answers
she
had
a
fine
spirit
and
no
wish
to
let
a
stranger
see
the
skeleton
in
the
cupboard
but
robinette
quick
instinct
pierced
through
the
veil
of
bravery
and
touched
the
truth
nurse
dear
she
said
you
say
you
comfortable
and
well
off
but
you
wo
mind
my
telling
you
that
i
just
do
quite
believe
you
oh
my
dear
heart
what
that
you
be
sayin
callin
of
me
a
liar
chuckled
the
old
woman
fondly
robinette
rose
from
her
seat
on
the
bench
and
stood
back
to
scrutinize
the
cottage
it
was
exquisitely
picturesque
but
this
very
picturesqueness
constituted
its
danger
for
the
place
was
a
perfect
death
trap
the
crumbling
that
had
taken
on
those
wonderful
patches
of
green
colour
soaked
in
the
damp
like
a
sponge
the
irregularity
of
the
thatched
roof
that
looked
so
well
admitted
trickles
of
rain
on
wet
nights
and
the
uneven
mud
floor
of
the
kitchen
revealed
the
fact
that
the
cottage
had
been
built
without
any
proper
foundation
the
door
did
not
fit
and
in
cold
weather
a
draught
must
run
in
under
it
all
this
quick
practical
glance
took
in
she
gave
a
little
nod
or
two
murmuring
to
herself
a
new
thatch
roof
a
new
door
a
new
cement
floor
then
she
came
and
sat
down
again
tell
me
now
how
much
do
you
have
to
live
on
every
week
nurse
she
asked
oh
miss
robinette
i
should
say
is
wonderful
how
i
gets
on
and
then
there
the
plum
tree
just
see
the
flourish
on
it
missie
dear
will
have
a
crop
o
plums
come
autumn
will
about
drag
down
the
boughs
i
do
know
how
would
be
with
me
without
i
had
the
plum
tree
do
you
really
make
something
by
it
robinette
asked
the
old
woman
chuckled
again
to
be
sure
i
makes
makes
jam
every
autumn
a
sight
o
jam
come
inside
again
me
dear
an
see
me
jam
cupboard
and
you
know
she
hobbled
into
the
kitchen
and
opened
the
door
of
a
wall
press
in
the
corner
there
row
above
row
stood
a
solid
phalanx
of
jam
pots
it
seemed
as
if
a
whole
town
might
be
supplied
out
of
cupboard
is
well
thought
of
me
jam
the
old
woman
said
grinning
with
pleasure
i
be
very
careful
in
the
preparing
of
gets
a
penny
the
pound
more
for
me
jam
than
others
along
of
its
being
so
fine
robinette
was
charmed
to
see
that
here
prettyman
had
a
reliable
source
of
income
however
slender
how
much
do
you
reckon
to
get
from
it
every
year
she
asked
going
five
pounds
dear
four
pounds
fifteen
shillings
and
sixpence
last
autumn
and
please
the
lord
there
a
better
crop
this
season
so
will
be
the
clear
five
pounds
oh
i
do
be
loving
me
plum
tree
like
a
friend
i
do
they
turned
back
into
the
sunshine
again
that
robinette
should
admire
this
wonderful
once
more
she
stood
under
its
shadow
with
great
delight
as
the
bible
says
gazing
up
through
the
intricate
network
of
boughs
and
blossom
to
the
cloudless
blue
above
her
it
heavenly
nurse
just
heavenly
she
sighed
as
she
came
and
sat
down
beside
the
old
woman
again
then
there
me
duck
too
missie
lard
now
i
do
know
how
i
be
without
i
had
me
duck
duckie
i
calls
and
duckie
she
is
company
she
is
too
to
me
mornin
with
her
quack
under
the
winder
so
the
old
woman
prattled
on
giving
robinette
all
the
history
of
her
life
with
its
tiny
joys
and
many
struggles
till
it
seemed
to
the
listener
that
she
had
always
known
prettyman
the
plum
tree
and
her
duck
known
them
and
loved
them
all
three
vi
mark
lavendar
hundreds
of
years
ago
the
street
of
stoke
revel
village
if
street
it
could
be
called
and
the
tower
of
the
ancient
church
must
have
looked
very
much
the
same
as
now
on
such
a
day
when
the
oak
woods
were
budding
and
the
english
birds
singing
and
the
spring
sun
was
hot
in
a
clear
sky
a
knight
riding
down
the
steep
lane
would
have
taken
the
same
turn
to
the
left
on
his
way
to
the
manor
were
he
a
young
man
he
would
probably
have
reined
up
his
horse
for
a
moment
and
looked
as
mark
lavendar
did
now
at
the
blithe
landscape
before
him
only
then
the
accessories
would
have
been
so
different
the
great
horse
somewhat
tired
by
long
hours
of
riding
the
armour
that
glinted
in
the
sun
the
casque
pushed
up
to
let
the
fresh
air
play
upon
the
rider
face
such
a
figure
must
have
often
stood
just
at
that
turn
where
the
lane
wound
up
the
little
hill
the
landscape
was
the
same
and
young
men
in
all
ages
are
very
much
the
same
so
although
this
one
had
merely
arrived
by
train
and
walked
from
the
nearest
station
mark
lavendar
stopped
and
leaned
over
the
low
wall
when
he
came
to
the
turn
of
the
road
and
looked
down
at
the
river
he
boasted
no
war
horse
nor
armour
none
of
the
trappings
of
the
older
world
added
to
his
distinction
and
yet
he
was
a
very
pleasing
figure
of
a
man
the
gaunt
brown
face
was
quite
hard
and
solemn
in
expression
ugly
but
not
commonplace
for
as
a
friend
once
said
of
him
his
eyes
seem
to
belong
to
another
person
it
was
not
this
but
only
that
the
eyes
blue
as
saint
veronica
flower
showed
suddenly
a
different
aspect
of
the
man
an
unexpected
tenderness
that
flatly
contradicted
the
hard
features
of
his
face
he
looked
very
nice
when
he
laughed
too
so
that
most
people
when
they
had
found
out
the
trick
tried
to
make
him
laugh
as
often
as
possible
what
a
day
heavens
what
a
lovely
day
he
said
to
himself
as
he
leaned
on
the
low
wall
i
want
to
be
courting
amaryllis
somewhere
in
these
woods
and
instead
i
got
to
go
and
talk
business
with
that
old
woman
and
he
looked
ruefully
towards
the
manor
house
for
this
was
not
his
first
visit
by
any
means
and
he
knew
only
too
well
the
hours
of
boredom
that
awaited
him
de
tracy
strange
to
say
had
a
soft
side
towards
this
young
man
the
son
of
her
family
solicitor
mark
was
invariably
sent
down
by
his
father
when
there
was
any
business
to
be
transacted
at
stoke
revel
the
older
man
was
fond
of
a
good
dinner
and
hated
circumlocution
about
affairs
and
it
was
only
when
a
death
in
the
family
or
some
other
crucial
event
made
his
presence
absolutely
necessary
that
he
came
down
himself
mark
was
sacrificed
instead
and
many
a
wearisome
hour
had
he
spent
in
that
house
however
on
this
occasion
he
had
been
glad
enough
to
get
out
of
london
for
a
while
the
country
was
divine
and
even
the
de
tracy
business
did
not
occupy
the
whole
day
there
would
be
hours
on
the
river
afternoons
spent
riding
along
those
green
lanes
through
which
he
had
just
passed
where
the
banks
were
starred
with
little
vivid
flowers
mark
had
an
almost
childish
delight
in
such
beauty
he
had
loitered
on
the
way
along
flung
himself
down
on
a
bank
for
a
few
minutes
and
burying
his
face
amongst
the
flowers
listened
with
a
smile
upon
his
mouth
to
the
birds
that
chirruped
in
the
branches
of
the
oak
above
him
now
he
leaned
on
the
low
wall
and
gazed
at
the
shining
reaches
of
the
river
what
a
day
he
said
to
himself
again
what
a
divine
afternoon
then
he
added
quite
simply
i
wish
i
were
in
love
everyone
under
eighty
ought
to
be
on
such
a
day
even
at
the
age
of
thirty
most
men
of
any
personal
attractions
have
some
romantic
memories
lavendar
had
his
share
but
somehow
that
morning
he
was
disconcertingly
candid
to
himself
it
may
have
been
the
sudden
change
from
london
air
and
london
noise
something
in
the
clear
transparency
of
the
april
day
in
the
melody
of
the
song
in
the
beauty
of
the
scene
before
him
that
made
all
the
moth
and
rust
that
had
consumed
the
remembrances
of
the
past
more
apparent
there
was
little
of
the
treasure
of
heaven
there
it
had
mostly
been
nonsense
or
vanity
or
worse
he
wanted
oh
how
he
wanted
to
be
able
just
for
once
to
surrender
himself
to
what
was
absolutely
ideal
to
have
a
memory
when
he
was
an
old
man
of
something
that
had
no
fault
in
it
no
i
never
been
really
in
love
he
said
to
himself
i
may
as
well
confess
it
and
i
daresay
i
never
shall
be
but
marry
on
an
impulse
like
most
men
make
the
best
of
it
afterwards
and
have
a
sort
of
happiness
in
the
end
of
the
day
one
two
three
said
the
church
clock
from
the
ancient
tower
booming
out
the
note
and
lavendar
started
and
rubbed
his
hands
across
his
dazzled
eyes
luncheon
is
a
late
meal
in
that
awful
house
if
i
remember
he
said
but
it
must
be
over
by
this
time
i
really
must
go
in
let
me
collect
my
thoughts
the
business
is
things
in
general
but
especially
the
sale
of
some
cottage
or
other
and
the
land
it
stands
on
yes
yes
i
remember
the
papers
are
all
right
now
for
the
old
ladies
he
made
his
entrance
into
the
manor
drawing
room
a
few
minutes
later
with
a
charming
smile
de
tracy
actually
walked
a
few
steps
to
meet
him
with
a
greeting
less
frigid
than
usual
i
glad
to
see
you
mark
said
she
bates
said
you
preferred
to
walk
from
the
station
mark
turned
his
kind
eyes
on
miss
smeardon
and
held
her
knuckly
hand
in
his
own
almost
tenderly
it
was
a
very
bad
habit
which
had
led
to
some
mischief
in
the
past
that
when
he
was
sorry
for
a
thing
he
wanted
to
be
very
kind
to
it
and
this
made
him
unusually
pleasing
and
dangerous
business
first
and
pleasure
afterwards
excellent
maxim
he
said
to
himself
half
an
hour
later
as
he
removed
the
dust
of
travel
from
his
person
preparatory
to
an
interview
with
de
tracy
now
for
it
he
liked
the
drawing
room
at
stoke
revel
and
always
wished
it
had
other
occupants
when
he
entered
it
this
afternoon
it
seemed
particularly
agreeable
the
open
windows
letting
in
the
slanting
sunshine
and
a
strong
scent
of
jonquils
and
sweet
briar
well
de
tracy
said
mark
i
am
my
father
spokesman
you
know
and
we
have
serious
business
to
discuss
but
tell
me
first
how
my
young
friend
carnaby
thank
you
my
grandson
has
a
severe
attack
of
quinsy
replied
de
tracy
he
is
to
have
whenever
the
endymion
returns
to
portsmouth
oh
carnaby
will
make
short
work
of
an
attack
of
quinsy
said
lavendar
genially
it
would
please
me
better
retorted
de
tracy
severely
if
my
grandson
showed
signs
of
mental
improvement
as
well
as
bodily
health
his
letters
are
and
they
are
the
letters
of
a
he
is
not
much
more
than
a
is
he
suggested
mark
only
fifteen
the
mental
improvement
will
come
too
soon
for
my
taste
i
like
carnaby
as
he
is
the
young
man
had
seated
himself
beside
his
hostess
in
an
attitude
of
perfect
ease
though
bored
by
his
present
environment
he
was
entirely
at
home
in
it
just
because
he
greatly
dared
towards
her
and
was
never
afraid
de
tracy
liked
him
with
the
mere
flicker
of
an
eyelid
she
dismissed
the
attendant
smeardon
there
has
been
an
offer
for
the
land
at
wittisham
lavendar
said
when
they
were
alone
de
tracy
winced
that
is
no
matter
of
congratulation
with
me
she
said
bleakly
but
it
is
with
us
for
it
is
a
most
excellent
one
returned
the
young
man
hardily
the
firm
has
had
the
responsibility
of
advising
the
sale
which
we
consider
absolutely
unavoidable
in
the
present
financial
condition
of
stoke
revel
we
have
advertised
for
a
year
and
advertisement
is
costly
now
comes
an
offer
of
a
somewhat
peculiar
kind
but
sound
enough
lavendar
here
produced
a
bundle
of
documents
tied
with
the
traditional
red
tape
an
artist
he
continued
waller
r
you
know
the
name
i
do
not
interpolated
de
tracy
grimly
nevertheless
a
well
known
painter
persisted
mark
and
one
as
it
happens
of
the
orchard
scenery
of
this
part
of
england
he
has
known
wittisham
for
a
long
time
and
only
last
year
he
made
a
success
with
the
painting
of
a
plum
tree
which
grows
in
front
of
one
of
the
cottages
it
was
sold
for
a
large
sum
and
as
a
matter
of
sentiment
i
suppose
waller
wishes
to
buy
the
cottage
and
make
it
into
a
summer
retreat
or
studio
for
himself
he
can
not
buy
it
said
de
tracy
with
the
snort
of
a
war
horse
he
can
not
buy
it
apart
from
the
land
insinuated
mark
but
he
is
flush
of
cash
and
ready
to
buy
the
land
too
very
nearly
as
much
as
we
want
to
sell
and
the
bargain
merely
waits
your
consent
the
sum
that
has
been
agreed
upon
is
of
the
kind
that
a
man
in
the
height
of
his
triumph
offers
for
a
fancy
article
no
such
sum
will
ever
be
offered
for
land
at
wittisham
again
old
orchard
land
falling
into
desuetude
as
it
is
and
covered
with
condemned
cottages
de
tracy
was
sternly
silent
and
mark
awaited
her
next
words
with
some
curiosity
he
felt
like
a
torturer
drawing
the
tooth
of
a
jew
in
the
good
old
days
this
sale
of
land
was
a
bitter
pill
to
the
widow
as
it
well
might
be
for
it
was
the
beginning
of
the
end
as
the
de
tracy
solicitors
could
have
told
you
there
had
been
de
tracys
of
stoke
revel
since
queen
elizabeth
time
but
there
would
not
be
de
tracys
of
stoke
revel
much
longer
unless
young
carnaby
married
an
heiress
when
he
came
of
age
and
that
no
de
tracy
had
ever
done
the
land
across
the
river
de
tracy
said
at
last
was
the
first
land
the
de
tracys
held
but
much
of
it
went
at
the
restoration
well
let
this
go
too
she
added
harshly
mark
blessed
himself
that
indecision
was
no
part
of
the
character
and
sighed
with
relief
my
father
would
like
to
know
he
said
what
you
propose
to
do
with
regard
to
the
old
woman
who
is
the
present
tenant
of
the
cottage
elizabeth
prettyman
is
not
a
tenant
said
de
tracy
coldly
she
is
practically
a
pensioner
since
she
lives
true
i
forgot
said
mark
soothingly
i
beg
your
pardon
do
not
suppose
that
it
is
by
my
wish
continued
de
tracy
coldly
i
have
never
approved
of
supporting
the
peasantry
in
idleness
this
woman
happened
to
be
for
some
years
nurse
to
cynthia
de
tracy
my
husband
younger
sister
who
deeply
offended
her
family
by
marrying
an
american
named
bean
i
see
no
claim
in
that
to
a
pension
of
any
kind
but
your
husband
saw
it
i
imagine
interpolated
mark
quietly
and
de
tracy
gave
him
a
fierce
look
which
he
met
however
without
a
sign
of
flinching
my
husband
had
a
mistaken
idea
that
prettyman
was
poor
when
she
became
a
widow
said
de
tracy
on
the
contrary
she
had
relations
quite
well
able
to
support
her
i
believe
i
never
cross
the
river
in
these
days
and
the
matter
has
escaped
my
memory
so
that
things
have
been
left
as
they
were
no
great
loss
said
mark
candidly
since
the
cottage
in
its
present
state
is
utterly
unfit
for
any
tenant
as
to
prettyman
is
it
your
intention
to
give
her
notice
to
quit
unquestionably
since
the
cottage
is
needed
answered
de
tracy
she
has
occupied
it
too
long
as
it
is
the
speaker
lips
closed
like
a
vice
over
the
words
god
pity
elizabeth
prettyman
ejaculated
lavendar
to
himself
might
is
right
still
apparently
at
stoke
revel
aloud
he
merely
said
a
weak
deference
to
public
opinion
was
never
a
foible
of
yours
de
tracy
but
i
think
i
would
advise
you
to
consider
some
question
of
compensation
to
prettyman
for
the
loss
of
the
cottage
if
you
can
show
me
that
the
woman
has
any
legal
claim
upon
the
estate
i
will
consider
the
question
but
not
otherwise
said
de
tracy
with
such
an
air
of
finality
that
lavendar
was
inclined
to
let
the
matter
drop
for
the
moment
the
firm
he
said
will
communicate
your
wishes
to
prettyman
by
letter
prettyman
can
not
read
snapped
de
tracy
she
must
be
told
and
the
sooner
the
better
well
de
tracy
said
the
young
man
with
a
short
laugh
provided
it
is
not
i
who
have
to
tell
her
well
and
good
i
warn
you
the
task
would
not
be
to
my
taste
unless
compensation
were
offered
her
de
tracy
features
hardened
to
a
degree
unusual
even
to
her
i
am
apparently
less
than
you
she
said
sardonically
i
shall
if
i
think
fit
deal
with
prettyman
in
person
the
subject
was
dropped
and
lavendar
rose
to
leave

detained

that
she
has
crossed
the

paying
a
visit
to

i
should
be
obliged

if

back

by
some
misunderstanding

i
shall
have
the
privilege

executing
your

from
the
house
where
even
in
the
it
seemed
unregenerate
to
light
a
cigar
and
took
the
path
to
the
shore
i
wonder
if
one
woman
staying
in
a
house
full
of
men
would
find
life
as
depressing
as
i
do
cooped
up
here
under
precisely
opposite
circumstances
he
thought
as
he
made
his
way
through
the
little
churchyard
it
can
not
be
the
atmosphere
of
femininity
that
bores
me
however
for
de
tracy
has
a
strongly
masculine
flavour
and
miss
smeardon
is
as
nearly
neuter
as
a
person
can
be
he
took
a
couple
of
oars
from
the
as
he
passed
and
going
to
the
little
landing
stage
untied
the
boat
and
started
for
the
farther
shore
it
was
good
to
feel
the
water
parting
under
his
vigorous
strokes
and
delightful
to
exert
his
strength
after
the
hours
of
stifled
irritation
at
the
manor
it
was
a
bright
calm
close
of
day
when
in
the
rarefied
evening
air
each
sound
began
to
acquire
the
sharpness
that
marks
the
hour
he
could
hear
the
rush
of
the
waters
behind
the
boat
and
the
voices
of
the
fishers
farther
up
the
stream
as
he
drew
up
to
the
bank
and
took
in
his
oars
the
stillness
was
so
great
that
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
fall
when
suddenly
from
a
tree
above
him
a
bird
broke
into
one
little
finished
song
and
then
was
still
as
if
it
had
uttered
all
it
wished
to
say
what
a
heavenly
evening
thought
lavendar
and
what
a
lovely
spot
that
must
be
the
cottage
just
above
me
de
tracy
said
i
should
know
it
by
the
plum
tree
ah
there
it
is
tying
up
the
boat
he
sprang
up
the
steps
and
walked
along
the
flagged
path
the
plum
tree
these
last
few
days
had
begun
to
look
its
fairest
the
blossoms
did
not
yet
conceal
the
leaves
but
it
was
a
very
bower
of
beauty
already
there
was
a
little
table
spread
for
tea
under
its
branches
and
an
old
woman
like
thousands
of
old
women
in
thousands
of
cottages
all
over
england
was
sitting
behind
it
precisely
as
if
she
had
been
a
coloured
illustration
in
a
summer
number
of
an
english
weekly
she
was
on
the
typical
bench
in
the
typical
attitude
but
instead
of
the
typical
old
man
in
a
clean
smock
frock
who
should
have
occupied
the
end
of
the
bench
there
sat
beside
her
a
distinctly
lovely
young
woman
what
struck
lavendar
was
the
wealth
of
colour
she
brought
into
the
picture
goldy
brown
hair
brown
tweed
dress
with
a
cape
of
blue
cloth
slipping
off
her
shoulders
and
a
brown
toque
with
a
pert
upstanding
quill
that
seemed
to
express
spirit
and
pluck
and
a
merry
heart
his
quick
glance
took
in
the
little
hands
that
held
the
withered
old
ones
both
heads
were
bowed
and
in
the
brown
tweed
lap
was
a
child
shoe
a
wee
worn
fat
shoe
beside
it
lay
an
absurd
bit
of
crumpled
embroidery
that
had
been
intended
to
do
duty
as
a
handkerchief
but
had
evidently
proved
quite
unseaworthy
waddling
about
on
the
flags
close
to
the
little
table
was
a
large
fat
duck
wearing
a
look
of
inexpressible
greed
quack
it
said
waddling
off
angrily
as
lavendar
approached
at
the
sound
of
the
duck
raucous
voice
both
the
women
looked
up
is
this
prettyman
cottage
lavendar
asked
with
his
charming
smile
yes
sir
is
indeed
and
who
may
you
be
if
i
may
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
i
lavendar
de
tracy
lawyer
prettyman
i
come
to
do
some
business
at
stoke
revel
he
added
for
the
old
face
had
clouded
over
and
prettyman
whole
expression
changed
to
one
of
timid
mistrust
i
really
was
sent
by
de
tracy
he
went
on
turning
to
robinette
to
take
you
home
loring
is
it
yes
i
am
loring
she
said
frankly
holding
out
her
hand
to
him
i
knew
you
were
expected
at
stoke
revel
but
i
sent
the
footman
back
myself
he
spoils
the
scenery
and
the
river
altogether
i
got
a
boat
down
there
de
tracy
does
quite
like
your
taking
the
ferry
may
i
have
the
honour
of
rowing
you
across
my
orders
were
to
bring
you
back
as
soon
as
possible
i
blest
if
i
hurry
was
his
unspoken
comment
as
robinette
gaily
agreed
and
having
bidden
to
the
old
woman
with
a
quick
caress
that
astonished
him
a
good
deal
she
laid
down
the
little
shoe
gently
upon
the
bench
and
turned
to
accompany
him
to
the
boat
the
river
was
like
a
the
air
like
balm
take
some
time
getting
across
against
the
tide
said
lavendar
reflectively
as
he
resolved
that
the
little
voyage
should
be
prolonged
to
its
fullest
possible
extent
he
was
not
going
into
the
manor
a
moment
earlier
than
he
could
help
when
this
charming
person
was
sitting
opposite
to
him
so
this
was
loring
how
different
from
the
stout
lady
whom
de
words
had
conjured
up
when
he
set
out
to
find
her
old
prettyman
was
my
mother
nurse
robinette
remarked
as
lavendar
dipped
his
oars
gently
into
the
stream
and
began
to
row
i
went
to
see
her
feeling
quite
grown
up
and
she
seemed
to
consider
me
still
a
child
i
was
feeling
about
four
years
old
at
the
moment
when
you
appeared
and
woke
me
to
the
real
world
again
she
had
dried
her
eyes
now
and
had
pulled
her
hat
down
so
as
to
shade
her
face
but
lavendar
could
see
the
traces
of
her
weeping
and
the
dear
little
ineffectual
rag
of
a
handkerchief
was
still
in
one
hand
what
on
earth
was
she
crying
about
he
thought
as
with
lowered
eyes
he
rowed
very
slowly
across
only
just
keeping
the
boat
head
against
the
current
and
glancing
now
and
then
at
the
young
woman
was
it
possible
that
this
lovely
person
was
going
to
be
his
in
that
dull
house
my
word
but
she
pretty
and
what
were
the
tears
about
and
the
little
shoe
did
it
belong
to
a
child
of
her
own
can
she
be
a
widow
i
wonder
said
lavendar
to
himself
i
often
think
he
said
suddenly
raising
his
head
that
when
two
people
meet
for
the
first
time
as
utter
strangers
to
each
other
they
should
be
encouraged
not
forbidden
to
ask
plain
questions
it
may
be
my
legal
training
but
i
like
all
conversation
to
begin
in
that
way
as
a
child
i
was
constantly
reproved
for
my
curiosity
especially
when
i
once
asked
a
touchy
old
gentleman
is
your
glass
eye
the
one
that
moves
or
the
one
that
stands
still
the
tears
had
dried
the
hat
was
pushed
back
again
the
young
face
broke
into
an
april
smile
that
matched
the
day
and
the
weather
oh
come
let
us
do
it
she
exclaimed
i
love
to
play
it
like
a
new
game
we
know
nothing
at
all
about
each
other
any
more
than
if
we
had
dropped
from
the
moon
into
the
boat
together
oh
do
be
quick
we
so
little
time
the
river
is
quite
narrow
who
to
open
the
ball
i
begin
by
right
of
my
profession
put
the
witness
in
the
box
what
is
your
name
madam
robinette
loring
she
said
demurely
clasping
her
hands
on
her
knee
an
almost
childlike
delight
in
the
new
game
dimpling
the
corners
of
her
mouth
from
time
to
time
what
is
your
age
madam
lavendar
hesitated
just
for
a
moment
before
putting
this
question
i
refuse
to
answer
you
must
guess
contempt
of
court
well
go
on
i
and
six
weeks
thank
you
you
are
remarkably
well
preserved
i
can
hardly
believe
those
what
nationality
american
of
course
or
half
and
half
with
an
english
mother
and
american
ideas
thank
you
where
is
your
present
place
of
residence
stoke
revel
manor
house
what
is
the
duration
of
the
visit
fixed
at
a
month
but
may
be
shortened
at
any
time
for
bad
behaviour
your
purpose
in
coming
to
stoke
revel
a
sentimental
journey
in
search
of
fond
relations
have
you
found
these
relations
i
found
them
but
the
fondness
is
still
to
seek
have
you
left
your
family
in
america
i
have
no
one
belonging
to
me
in
the
world
she
answered
simply
and
her
bright
face
clouded
suddenly
there
was
a
moment
rather
embarrassed
silence
it
getting
to
be
a
sad
game
she
said
it
my
turn
now
i
be
the
but
not
having
had
your
legal
training
i
tell
you
a
few
facts
about
this
witness
to
begin
with
he
a
lawyer
i
know
that
already
your
christian
name
sir
mark
mark
lavendar
the
perfect
man
where
have
i
heard
that
in
pope
or
in
the
bible
thank
you
very
good
your
age
is
between
thirty
and
with
a
strong
probability
that
it
is
am
i
right
approximately
madam
you
are
unmarried
for
married
men
do
play
games
like
this
they
are
too
sedate
you
reassure
me
am
i
expected
to
acknowledge
the
truth
of
all
your
observations
you
have
only
to
answer
my
questions
sir
i
am
unmarried
madam
your
nationality
english
of
course
you
do
count
a
french
grandmother
i
suppose
robinette
clapped
her
hands
of
course
i
do
it
accounts
for
this
game
it
just
makes
all
the
why
have
you
come
to
stoke
revel
could
you
help
it
a
twinkle
passed
from
the
blue
eyes
to
the
brown
ones
i
am
here
on
business
connected
with
the
estate
for
how
long
an
hour
ago
i
thought
all
might
be
completed
in
a
few
days
but
these
affairs
are
sometimes
unaccountably
prolonged
was
there
another
twinkle
robinette
could
hardly
say
they
were
across
the
river
now
she
leaned
over
and
looked
at
herself
in
the
water
for
a
moment
lavendar
rested
on
his
oars
and
began
to
rub
the
palms
of
his
hands
smiling
a
little
to
himself
as
he
bent
his
head
yours
is
an
odd
christian
name
he
said
i
never
heard
it
before
then
you
have
visited
your
national
gallery
faithfully
enough
said
loring
robinetta
is
one
of
the
sir
joshua
pictures
there
you
know
and
it
was
a
great
favourite
of
my
mother
in
her
girlhood
indeed
she
saved
up
her
for
nearly
two
years
that
she
might
have
a
good
copy
of
it
made
to
hang
in
her
bedroom
where
she
could
look
at
it
night
and
morning
then
you
were
named
after
the
picture
i
was
named
from
the
memory
of
it
said
robinette
trailing
her
hand
through
the
clear
water
mother
took
nothing
to
america
with
her
but
my
father
love
there
was
so
much
of
that
it
made
up
for
all
she
left
behind
so
the
picture
was
thousands
of
miles
away
when
i
was
born
mother
told
me
that
when
i
was
first
put
into
her
arms
she
thought
suddenly
as
she
saw
my
dark
head
is
my
own
robinetta
in
place
of
the
one
i
left
behind
and
fell
asleep
straight
away
full
of
joy
and
content
and
they
shortened
the
name
to
robinette
i
was
christened
properly
enough
she
answered
it
was
the
world
that
clipped
my
name
little
wings
the
world
refuses
to
take
me
seriously
i
ca
think
why
i
sure
i
never
regarded
as
a
joke
a
joke
said
lavendar
reflectively
it
a
sort
of
grim
one
at
times
and
yet
it
funny
too
he
said
suddenly
raising
his
eyes
now
that
the
odd
thing
i
was
thinking
as
i
looked
at
you
just
now
robinette
said
frankly
you
seem
so
deadly
solemn
until
you
look
up
and
laugh
and
then
you
laugh
you
know
that
the
french
grandmother
again
it
was
nice
in
her
to
marry
your
grandfather
it
helped
a
lot
he
laughed
then
certainly
and
so
did
she
and
then
pointed
out
to
him
that
they
were
being
slowly
drifted
out
of
their
course
and
that
if
he
meant
to
get
across
to
the
he
must
row
a
little
harder
i
have
met
american
women
casually
he
said
bending
to
his
oars
but
i
have
never
known
one
well
it
rather
too
bad
to
disturb
the
tranquillity
of
your
impressions
returned
loring
composedly
lavendar
looked
up
with
another
twinkle
she
seemed
to
provoke
twinkles
he
did
not
realize
he
had
so
many
in
stock
you
mean
american
women
are
not
painted
in
quite
the
right
colours
i
suppose
black
a
colour
oh
i
see
your
point
of
view
and
lavendar
twinkled
again
i
can
tell
you
in
five
sentences
exactly
what
you
have
heard
about
us
will
you
say
whether
i
am
right
if
you
refuse
i
put
you
in
the
witness
box
and
then
you
be
forced
to
speak
very
well
proceed
one
we
are
clever
good
conversationalists
and
as
cold
as
icicles
yes
two
we
dress
beautifully
and
use
extravagant
means
to
compass
our
ends
in
this
direction
yes
three
we
keep
our
overworked
husbands
under
strict
discipline
yes
i
say
i
do
like
this
game
neither
do
i
but
it
very
much
played
four
we
prefer
hotels
to
home
life
and
do
bring
up
our
children
well
yes
five
we
interfere
with
the
proper
game
laws
by
bagging
english
husbands
instead
of
staying
on
our
own
preserves
that
about
all
i
think
were
not
those
rumours
tolerably
familiar
to
you
in
the
papers
and
their
human
counterparts
lavendar
was
so
amused
by
this
direct
storming
of
his
opinion
that
he
could
hardly
keep
his
laughter
within
bounds
i
heard
one
other
criticism
he
said
that
you
were
all
pretty
and
all
had
small
feet
and
hands
i
am
now
able
to
declare
that
to
be
a
base
calumny
and
to
hope
that
all
the
others
will
prove
just
as
false
then
robinette
laughed
too
eyes
lips
cheeks
when
lavendar
looked
at
her
he
wished
that
his
father
would
keep
him
at
stoke
revel
for
a
month
the
sun
was
going
down
now
and
the
rising
tide
came
swelling
up
from
the
sea
lifting
itself
and
silently
swelling
the
volume
of
the
river
in
a
way
that
had
something
awful
about
it
the
whole
current
of
the
great
stream
was
against
it
but
behind
was
the
force
of
the
sea
and
so
it
filled
and
filled
with
hardly
a
ripple
as
the
heart
is
filled
with
a
new
desire
up
from
the
mouth
of
the
river
came
a
faint
breeze
bringing
the
taste
of
the
ocean
into
the
deeply
wooded
creeks
it
had
freshened
into
a
little
wind
as
they
drew
up
at
the
that
flapped
robinette
blue
cape
about
her
and
dyed
the
colour
in
her
cheeks
to
a
livelier
tint
as
they
walked
up
the
narrow
pathway
to
the
house
a
deep
silence
fell
between
them
that
neither
attempted
to
break
at
the
top
of
the
hill
she
paused
to
take
breath
and
look
across
the
river
it
was
half
dark
already
there
on
the
other
side
in
the
deep
shadow
of
the
hill
and
a
lamp
in
the
window
of
the
cottage
shone
like
a
star
beside
the
faintly
green
shape
of
the
budding
plum
tree
as
robinette
entered
the
door
of
the
manor
house
she
took
out
her
little
purse
and
handed
mark
lavendar
a
penny
it
none
too
much
she
said
meeting
his
astonished
gaze
with
a
smile
i
should
have
had
to
pay
it
on
the
public
ferry
and
you
were
ever
so
much
nicer
than
the
footman
lavendar
put
the
penny
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
has
never
spent
it
to
this
day
it
is
impossible
to
explain
these
things
one
can
only
state
them
as
facts
another
fact
too
that
he
suddenly
remembered
when
he
went
to
his
room
was
that
the
moment
her
personality
touched
his
he
was
filled
with
curiosity
about
her
he
had
met
hundreds
of
women
and
enjoyed
their
conversation
but
seldom
longed
to
know
on
the
instant
everything
that
had
previously
happened
to
them
viii
sunday
at
stoke
revel
on
sundays
the
stoke
revel
household
was
expected
to
appear
at
church
in
full
strength
visitors
included
we
meet
in
the
hall
punctually
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
it
was
miss
smeardon
duty
to
announce
to
strangers
de
tracy
always
prefers
that
the
stoke
revel
guests
should
walk
down
together
as
it
sets
a
good
example
to
the
villagers
what
nelson
said
about
going
to
church
with
lady
hamilton
lavendar
had
once
commented
irrepressibly
but
the
allusion
rather
fortunately
was
lost
upon
miss
smeardon
mark
began
to
picture
the
familiar
sunday
scene
to
himself
miss
smeardon
in
the
hall
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
punctually
marshalling
the
and
loring
she
would
be
late
of
course
and
come
fluttering
downstairs
in
some
bewitching
combination
of
flowery
hat
and
floating
scarf
that
no
one
had
ever
seen
before
what
a
lover
opportunity
in
this
lateness
thought
the
young
man
to
himself
but
one
could
enjoy
a
walk
to
church
in
charming
company
though
something
less
than
a
lover
it
was
de
tracy
custom
on
sunday
mornings
to
precede
her
household
by
half
an
hour
in
going
to
the
sanctuary
no
infirmities
of
old
age
had
invaded
her
iron
constitution
and
it
was
nothing
to
her
to
walk
alone
to
the
church
of
stoke
revel
steep
though
the
hill
was
which
led
down
through
the
ancient
village
to
the
yet
more
ancient
edifice
at
its
foot
during
this
solitary
interval
de
tracy
visited
her
husband
tomb
and
no
one
knew
or
dared
or
cared
to
enquire
what
motive
encouraged
this
pious
action
in
a
character
so
devoid
of
tenderness
and
sentiment
was
it
affection
was
it
duty
was
it
a
mere
form
a
tribute
to
the
greatness
of
an
owner
of
stoke
revel
such
as
a
nation
pays
to
a
dead
king
who
could
tell
the
graveyard
of
stoke
revel
owned
a
yew
tree
so
very
very
old
that
the
count
of
its
years
was
lost
and
had
become
a
fable
or
a
fairy
tale
it
was
twisted
gnarled
and
low
and
its
long
branches
which
would
have
reached
the
ground
were
upheld
like
the
arms
of
some
dying
patriarch
by
supports
themselves
old
and
under
the
spreading
of
this
ancient
tree
were
graves
and
from
the
carved
porch
of
the
church
a
path
led
among
them
under
the
green
tunnel
out
into
the
sunny
space
beyond
it
the
admiral
lay
in
a
vault
of
which
the
door
was
at
the
side
of
the
church
for
no
de
tracy
of
course
could
occupy
a
mere
grave
like
one
of
the
common
herd
and
here
walked
the
funereal
figure
of
de
tracy
fair
weather
or
foul
nearly
every
sunday
in
the
year
in
justice
to
de
tracy
it
must
be
made
plain
that
with
all
her
faults
small
spite
was
not
a
part
of
her
character
yet
her
anger
had
been
stirred
by
an
incident
so
small
that
its
very
triviality
annoyed
her
pride
it
was
mark
lavendar
custom
when
his
visits
to
stoke
revel
included
a
sunday
cheerfully
to
evade
his
sundays
in
the
country
were
few
he
said
and
he
preferred
to
enjoy
them
in
the
temple
of
nature
generally
taking
a
long
walk
before
lunch
but
he
had
announced
his
intention
of
coming
to
service
and
well
de
tracy
versed
in
men
and
in
human
nature
knew
why
robinette
would
be
there
and
lavendar
followed
as
the
bee
follows
a
basket
of
flowers
on
a
summer
day
as
de
tracy
like
the
stoic
that
she
was
accepted
all
the
inevitable
facts
of
life
birth
death
love
hate
she
had
known
them
all
in
her
day
she
accepted
this
one
also
but
in
that
atrophy
of
every
feeling
except
bitterness
that
atrophy
which
is
perhaps
the
only
real
solitude
the
only
real
old
age
her
animosity
was
stirred
it
was
as
though
a
dead
branch
upon
some
living
tree
was
angry
with
the
spring
for
breathing
on
it
as
she
returned
herself
unseen
in
the
shadow
of
the
yew
tree
she
saw
lavendar
and
robinette
enter
together
under
the
the
figure
of
the
young
woman
touched
with
sunlight
and
colour
her
lips
moving
and
lavendar
smiling
in
answer
in
the
clashing
of
the
bells
bells
which
shook
the
air
the
earth
the
ancient
stones
the
very
nests
upon
the
trees
their
voices
were
inaudible
but
in
their
faces
was
a
young
happiness
and
hope
to
which
the
solitary
woman
could
not
blind
herself
presently
in
the
lukewarm
air
within
robinette
was
finding
the
church
immemorial
smell
of
hassocks
decaying
wood
damp
stones
matting
and
altar
flowers
a
harmonious
and
suggestive
one
if
not
pleasant
what
an
ancient
air
it
was
she
thought
breathed
and
by
slow
generations
of
stoke
revellers
during
their
sleepy
devotions
the
very
light
that
entered
through
the
dim
stained
glass
seemed
old
and
dusty
it
had
seen
so
much
during
so
many
hundred
years
seen
so
much
and
found
out
so
many
secrets
soon
the
clashing
of
the
bells
ceased
and
upon
the
still
reverberating
silence
there
broke
the
small
snoring
noises
of
a
rather
ineffectual
organ
while
the
amiable
curate
rev
tobias
finch
made
his
appearance
and
the
service
began
de
tracy
had
entered
the
pew
first
naturally
miss
smeardon
sat
next
then
robinetta
lavendar
occupied
the
pew
in
front
alone
and
through
her
eyelids
robinetta
could
see
the
line
of
his
lean
cheek
and
bony
temple
he
had
not
wished
to
sit
there
at
all
and
he
was
so
unresigned
as
to
be
badly
in
need
of
the
soothing
influences
of
morning
prayer
robinetta
was
beginning
to
wonder
dreamily
what
manner
of
man
this
really
was
behind
his
plain
face
and
manner
when
the
muffled
slam
of
a
door
behind
startled
her
followed
as
it
was
by
a
quick
step
upon
the
matted
aisle
then
without
further
warning
a
big
boy
in
the
uniform
of
a
british
midshipman
thrust
himself
into
the
pew
beside
her
hot
and
breathless
after
running
hard
loring
guessed
at
once
that
this
must
be
carnaby
de
tracy
the
young
hopeful
and
heir
of
stoke
revel
of
whom
lavendar
had
so
often
spoken
but
the
startling
and
unconventional
nature
of
his
appearance
was
not
at
all
what
one
expected
in
a
member
of
his
family
robinette
stole
more
than
one
look
at
him
as
the
offertory
went
round
a
robust
boy
with
a
square
chin
a
fair
face
burnt
red
by
the
sun
a
rollicking
eye
and
an
impudent
nose
not
handsome
certainly
indeed
quite
plain
but
he
looked
honest
and
strong
and
clean
and
robinette
frolicsome
youth
was
drawn
to
his
all
ready
for
fun
carnaby
hitched
about
a
good
deal
dropped
his
moved
the
hassock
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
on
discovering
a
huge
hole
turned
crimson
service
over
the
congregation
shuffled
out
into
the
sunshine
and
de
tracy
after
a
characteristically
cool
and
disapproving
recognition
of
her
grandson
became
occupied
with
villagers
lavendar
made
known
young
carnaby
to
david
loring
but
the
midshipman
light
grey
eyes
had
discovered
the
pretty
face
without
any
assistance
this
lady
is
your
american
cousin
carnaby
said
mark
did
you
know
you
had
one
i
do
think
i
did
answered
the
boy
but
it
never
too
late
to
mend
he
attempted
a
bow
of
finished
failed
somewhat
and
melted
at
once
into
an
engaging
boyishness
under
which
his
frank
admiration
of
his
relative
was
not
to
be
hidden
i
say
are
you
stopping
at
stoke
revel
he
asked
as
though
the
news
were
too
good
to
be
true
jolly
hullo
he
broke
off
with
animation
as
the
cassocked
figure
of
the
rev
tobias
finch
fluttered
out
from
the
porch
here
old
toby
watch
miss
smeardon
now
she
expects
to
catch
him
you
know
but
he
says
he
going
to
be
a
celly
celibate
suggested
lavendar
with
laughing
eyes
the
very
word
thank
you
said
carnaby
yes
a
celibate
not
so
easily
nicked
good
old
toby
you
bet
do
the
clergymen
over
here
always
dress
like
that
inquired
robinetta
trying
to
suppress
a
tendency
to
laugh
at
his
slang
cassock
said
carnaby
toby
would
be
seen
without
it
high
you
know
bicycles
in
it
fact
goes
to
bed
in
it
i
believe
carnaby
carnaby
come
away
said
lavendar
restrain
these
flights
of
imagination
do
you
see
how
they
shock
mrs
loring
before
the
manor
was
reached
robinetta
and
carnaby
had
sworn
eternal
friendship
deeper
than
any
cousinship
they
both
declared
they
met
upon
a
sort
of
platform
of
stoke
revel
predestined
to
sympathy
upon
all
its
salient
characteristics
two
naughty
children
on
a
holiday
do
you
get
enough
to
eat
here
asked
carnaby
in
a
hollow
whisper
in
the
before
lunch
of
course
i
have
enough
middy
answered
robinetta
with
unconscious
reservation
she
had
rejected
carnaby
at
once
as
a
name
quite
impossible
he
was
middy
to
her
almost
from
the
first
moment
of
their
acquaintance
enough
he
ejaculated
do
i
never
be
fed
if
it
for
old
bates
and
smith
and
cooky
bates
was
the
butler
smith
the
housekeeper
and
cooky
her
satellite
nobody
gets
enough
to
eat
in
this
house
added
carnaby
darkly
except
the
dog
at
the
the
antagonism
natural
between
a
impetuous
boy
and
a
grandmother
such
as
de
tracy
became
rather
painfully
apparent
he
had
already
been
hauled
over
the
coals
for
his
arrival
on
sunday
and
his
indecorous
appearance
in
church
after
service
had
begun
it
does
not
appear
to
me
that
you
are
at
all
in
need
of
said
de
tracy
suspiciously
carnaby
sensitive
for
all
his
robustness
flushed
hotly
and
then
became
impertinent
my
pulse
is
twenty
beats
too
quick
still
after
quinsy
if
you
do
believe
the
doctor
it
not
my
fault
carnaby
has
committed
indiscretions
in
the
way
of
growing
since
i
last
saw
him
lavendar
broke
in
hastily
at
sixteen
one
may
easily
outgrow
one
strength
indeed
said
de
tracy
frigidly
the
situation
was
saved
by
the
behaviour
of
the
which
suddenly
burst
into
a
passion
of
barking
and
convulsive
struggling
in
miss
smeardon
arms
his
enemy
had
come
and
carnaby
had
fifty
ways
of
exasperating
his
favourite
secrets
between
him
and
the
bewildered
dog
rupert
was
a
prince
charles
of
pedigree
as
unquestioned
as
his
mistress
and
an
appearance
dating
back
to
vandyke
but
carnaby
always
addressed
him
as
lord
roberts
for
reasons
of
his
own
it
annoyed
his
grandmother
and
it
infuriated
the
dog
who
took
it
for
a
deadly
insult
lord
roberts
bobs
old
man
hi
hi
carnaby
had
but
to
say
the
words
to
make
the
little
dog
convulsive
he
said
them
now
and
the
results
seemed
likely
to
be
fatal
to
a
dropsical
animal
so
soon
after
a
full
meal
you
kill
him
whispered
robinette
as
they
left
the
dining
room
i
mean
to
was
the
calm
reply
i
like
to
wring
old
neck
too
but
the
broad
good
humour
of
the
rosy
face
the
twinkling
eyes
belied
these
truculent
words
in
spite
of
infinite
powers
of
mischief
there
was
not
an
ounce
of
vindictiveness
in
carnaby
de
tracy
though
there
might
be
other
qualities
difficult
to
deal
with
there
a
man
to
be
made
there
or
to
be
marred
said
robinette
to
herself
ix
points
of
view
evenings
at
stoke
revel
were
of
a
dullness
all
too
deep
to
be
sounded
and
too
closely
hedged
in
by
tradition
and
observance
to
be
evaded
or
shortened
by
the
boldest
visitor
lavendar
and
the
boy
would
have
prolonged
their
respite
in
the
smoking
room
had
they
dared
but
in
these
later
days
lavendar
found
he
wished
to
be
below
on
guard
the
thought
of
robinette
alone
between
the
two
women
downstairs
made
him
uneasy
it
was
as
though
some
bird
of
bright
plumage
had
strayed
into
a
barnyard
to
be
pecked
at
by
hens
not
but
what
he
realised
that
this
particular
bird
had
a
spirit
of
her
own
and
plenty
of
courage
but
no
man
with
even
a
prospective
interest
in
a
pretty
woman
likes
to
think
of
the
object
of
his
admiration
as
thoroughly
well
able
to
look
after
herself
she
must
needs
have
a
protector
and
the
one
is
himself
he
had
to
take
up
arms
in
her
defense
on
this
the
first
night
of
his
arrival
loring
had
gone
up
to
her
room
for
some
photographs
of
her
house
in
america
and
as
she
flitted
through
the
door
her
scarf
caught
on
the
knob
and
he
had
been
obliged
to
extricate
it
he
had
known
her
exactly
four
hours
and
although
he
was
unconscious
of
it
his
heart
was
being
pulled
along
the
passage
and
up
the
stairway
at
the
of
that
wisp
of
chiffon
while
he
listened
to
her
retreating
footsteps
closing
the
door
he
came
back
to
de
side
her
dress
is
indecorous
for
a
widow
said
that
lady
severely
oh
i
do
see
that
replied
lavendar
she
is
in
reality
only
a
girl
and
her
widowhood
has
already
lasted
two
years
you
say
once
a
widow
always
a
widow
returned
de
tracy
sententiously
with
a
glance
at
her
own
cap
and
the
dull
jet
ornaments
she
affected
lavendar
laughed
outright
but
she
rather
liked
his
laughter
it
made
her
think
herself
witty
once
he
had
told
her
she
was
delicious
and
she
had
never
forgotten
it
that
going
pretty
far
my
dear
lady
he
replied
not
all
women
are
so
faithful
to
a
memory
as
you
i
understand
americans
do
wear
weeds
and
to
me
her
blue
cape
is
a
delightful
note
in
the
landscape
her
dresses
are
conventional
and
proper
and
i
fancy
she
can
not
express
herself
without
a
bit
of
colour
the
object
of
clothing
mark
is
to
cover
and
to
protect
yourself
not
to
express
yourself
said
de
tracy
bitingly
the
thought
of
wearing
anything
bright
always
makes
me
shrink
remarked
miss
smeardon
who
had
never
apparently
observed
the
tip
of
her
own
nose
but
some
persons
are
less
sensitive
on
these
points
than
others
de
tracy
bowed
an
approving
assent
to
this
a
widow
only
concern
should
be
to
refrain
from
attracting
notice
she
said
as
though
quoting
from
a
private
book
of
proverbial
philosophy
soon
to
be
published
then
loring
might
as
well
have
burned
herself
on
her
funeral
pyre
hindoo
fashion
argued
lavendar
a
woman
life
ended
at
two
and
twenty
it
hardly
begun
and
i
fear
the
lady
in
question
will
arouse
attention
whatever
she
wears
would
she
be
called
attractive
asked
de
tracy
with
surprise
oh
yes
without
a
doubt
in
gentlemen
eyes
i
suppose
you
mean
said
miss
smeardon
yes
in
gentlemen
eyes
answered
lavendar
firmly
those
of
women
are
apparently
furnished
with
different
lenses
but
here
comes
the
fair
object
of
our
discussion
so
we
must
decide
it
later
on
the
question
of
ancestors
a
favourite
one
at
stoke
revel
came
up
in
the
course
of
the
next
evening
conversation
and
lavendar
found
robinette
a
trifle
flushed
but
smiling
under
a
double
fire
of
questions
from
de
tracy
and
her
companion
de
tracy
was
in
her
usual
chair
knitting
miss
smeardon
sat
by
the
table
with
a
piece
of
robinette
had
pulled
a
to
the
hearthrug
and
sat
as
near
the
flames
as
she
conveniently
could
she
shielded
her
face
with
the
last
copy
of
and
let
her
shoulders
bask
in
the
warmth
of
the
fire
which
made
flickering
shadows
on
her
creamy
neck
her
white
skirts
swept
softly
round
her
feet
and
her
favourite
turquoise
scarf
made
a
note
of
colour
in
her
lap
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
without
positive
beauty
always
make
pictures
of
themselves
lavendar
analyzed
her
looks
as
he
joined
the
circle
pretending
to
read
she
is
posing
he
thought
but
she
ought
to
be
painted
she
ought
always
to
be
painted
each
time
one
sees
her
for
everything
about
her
suggests
a
portrait
that
blue
ribbon
in
her
hair
is
fairly
distracting
what
the
dickens
is
the
reason
one
wants
to
look
at
her
all
the
time
i
seen
far
handsomer
women
do
you
use
burke
and
debrett
in
your
country
mrs
loring
miss
smeardon
was
enquiring
politely
as
she
laid
down
one
red
volume
after
the
other
having
ascertained
the
complete
family
tree
of
a
lady
who
had
called
that
afternoon
robinette
smiled
i
afraid
we
nothing
but
telephone
or
business
directories
social
registers
and
who
in
america
she
said
you
are
not
interested
in
questions
of
genealogy
i
suppose
asked
de
tracy
pityingly
i
can
hardly
say
that
but
i
think
perhaps
that
we
are
more
occupied
with
the
future
than
with
the
past
that
is
natural
assented
the
lady
of
the
manor
since
you
have
so
much
more
of
it
have
you
but
the
mixture
of
races
in
your
country
she
continued
condescendingly
must
have
made
you
indifferent
to
purity
of
strain
i
hope
we
are
not
wholly
indifferent
said
robinette
as
though
she
were
stopping
to
consider
i
think
every
person
must
be
proud
to
inherit
fine
qualities
and
to
pass
them
on
surely
it
is
enough
to
give
blood
to
the
next
generation
it
must
be
blood
yes
the
right
stock
certainly
means
something
to
an
american
but
if
you
nothing
that
answers
to
burke
and
debrett
i
do
see
how
you
can
find
out
anybody
pedigree
objected
miss
smeardon
then
with
an
air
of
innocent
curiosity
and
a
glance
supposed
to
be
arch
are
the
red
indians
the
negroes
and
the
chinese
in
your
directories
as
many
of
them
as
are
in
business
or
have
won
their
way
to
any
position
among
men
no
doubt
are
there
i
suppose
answered
robinette
straightforwardly
i
think
we
just
guess
at
people
ancestry
by
the
way
they
look
act
and
speak
she
continued
musingly
you
can
quite
well
if
you
are
clever
at
it
no
indians
or
chinese
ever
dine
with
me
miss
smeardon
though
i
rather
like
a
peaceful
indian
at
dinner
for
a
change
but
i
expect
he
find
me
very
dull
and
uneventful
dull
that
a
word
i
very
often
hear
on
american
lips
broke
in
lavendar
as
he
looked
over
the
top
of
henry
newbolt
poems
i
believe
being
dull
is
thought
a
criminal
offence
in
your
country
now
is
there
some
danger
involved
in
this
fear
of
dullness
i
should
wonder
robinette
answered
thoughtfully
looking
into
the
fire
yes
i
dare
say
there
is
but
i
afraid
there
are
social
and
mental
dangers
involved
in
being
afraid
of
it
too
her
mischievous
eyes
swept
the
room
with
de
tracy
solemn
figure
and
miss
smeardon
for
its
bright
ornaments
the
moment
a
person
or
a
nation
allows
itself
to
be
too
dull
it
ceases
to
be
quite
alive
does
it
but
as
to
us
americans
lavendar
bear
with
us
for
a
few
years
we
are
so
ridiculously
young
it
is
our
growing
time
and
what
you
want
in
a
young
plant
is
growth
is
it
lavendar
replied
then
with
a
twinkle
in
his
blue
eyes
he
added
only
somehow
we
do
like
to
hear
a
plant
grow
it
should
manage
to
perform
the
operation
quite
silently
showing
not
processes
but
results
that
a
counsel
of
perfection
perhaps
but
do
slay
me
for
mrs
loring
robinette
laughed
i
never
slay
you
for
saying
anything
so
wise
and
true
as
that
she
said
and
lavendar
flushing
under
her
praise
was
charmed
with
her
good
humour
america
a
very
large
country
is
it
not
enquired
miss
smeardon
with
her
usual
brilliancy
what
is
its
area
bigger
than
england
but
not
as
big
as
the
british
empire
suggested
carnaby
feeling
the
conversation
was
drifting
into
his
ken
it
just
the
size
of
the
moon
i
heard
said
robinette
teasingly
does
that
throw
any
light
on
the
question
moonlight
laughed
carnaby
much
pleased
with
his
own
wit
ha
ha
that
the
first
joke
i
made
this
holidays
jolly
good
if
you
take
a
joke
a
little
more
in
your
stride
my
son
said
lavendar
we
should
be
more
impressed
by
your
mental
sparkles
straighten
the
carnaby
said
his
grandmother
and
do
lounge
i
missed
the
point
of
your
joke
entirely
as
to
the
size
of
a
country
or
anything
else
i
have
never
understood
that
it
affected
its
quality
in
fruit
or
vegetables
for
instance
it
generally
means
coarseness
and
indifferent
flavour
miss
smeardon
beamed
at
this
palpable
hit
but
loring
deprived
the
situation
of
its
point
by
backing
up
de
tracy
heartily
she
had
no
opinion
of
mere
size
either
she
declared
you
do
stand
up
for
your
country
half
enough
objected
carnaby
to
his
cousin
why
do
you
give
the
old
cat
beans
was
his
supplement
just
attack
some
of
my
pet
theories
and
convictions
middy
dear
if
you
wish
to
see
me
in
a
rage
said
robinette
lightly
but
my
motto
will
never
be
country
right
or
wrong
nor
mine
agreed
lavendar
i
heartily
with
you
there
it
a
great
venture
we
trying
in
america
i
wish
every
one
would
try
to
look
at
it
in
that
light
said
robinette
with
a
slight
flush
of
earnestness
what
do
you
mean
by
a
venture
asked
de
tracy
the
experiment
we
making
in
democracy
answered
robinette
fallen
to
us
to
try
it
for
of
course
it
simply
had
to
be
tried
it
is
thrillingly
interesting
whatever
it
may
turn
out
and
i
wish
i
might
live
to
see
the
end
of
it
we
are
creating
a
race
aunt
de
tracy
think
of
that
it
as
difficult
for
nations
as
for
individuals
to
hit
the
happy
medium
said
lavendar
stirring
the
fire
enterprise
carried
too
far
becomes
vulgar
hustling
while
stability
and
conservatism
often
pass
the
coveted
point
of
repose
and
degenerate
into
torpor
this
part
of
england
seems
to
me
singularly
free
from
faults
interposed
de
tracy
in
didactic
tones
we
have
a
wonderful
climate
more
sunshine
than
in
any
part
of
the
island
i
believe
our
local
society
is
singularly
free
from
scandal
the
clergy
if
not
quite
as
eloquent
or
profound
as
in
london
and
in
my
opinion
it
is
the
better
for
being
neither
is
strictly
conscientious
we
have
no
burglars
or
locusts
or
gnats
or
even
midges
as
i
told
they
unfortunately
have
in
scotland
and
our
though
quiet
and
dignified
are
never
dull
what
is
the
matter
robinetta
a
sudden
catch
in
my
throat
said
robinette
struggling
with
some
sort
of
vocal
difficulty
and
avoiding
lavendar
eye
thank
you
as
he
offered
her
a
glass
of
water
from
the
punctual
and
strictly
temperate
evening
tray
do
look
at
me
she
added
under
her
voice
not
for
a
million
of
money
he
whispered
then
he
said
aloud
if
i
ever
stand
for
parliament
loring
i
should
like
you
to
help
me
with
my
constituency
the
unruffled
temper
and
sweet
reasonableness
of
robinette
answers
to
questions
by
no
means
always
devoid
of
malice
had
struck
the
young
man
very
much
as
he
listened
she
is
good
he
thought
to
himself
good
and
sweet
and
generous
her
loveliness
is
not
only
in
her
face
it
is
in
her
heart
and
some
favorite
lines
began
to
run
in
his
head
that
night
with
new
conviction
he
that
loves
a
rosy
cheek
or
a
coral
lip
admires
or
from
eyes
doth
seek
fuel
to
maintain
his
fires
as
old
time
makes
these
decay
so
his
flames
will
waste
away
but
a
smooth
and
steadfast
mind
gentle
thoughts
and
calm
desires
hearts
with
equal
love
combined
but
here
lavendar
broke
off
with
a
laugh
it
not
come
to
that
yet
he
thought
i
wonder
if
it
ever
will
x
a
new
kinsman
young
loring
was
making
her
way
slowly
at
stoke
revel
manor
and
de
tracy
though
never
affectionate
treated
her
with
a
little
less
indifference
as
the
days
went
on
the
admiral
niece
is
a
lady
she
admitted
to
herself
privately
not
perhaps
the
highest
type
of
english
lady
that
considering
her
mixed
ancestry
and
american
education
would
be
too
much
to
expect
but
in
the
broad
general
meaning
of
the
word
unmistakably
a
lady
benson
though
not
melting
outwardly
as
yet
held
more
lenient
views
still
with
regard
to
the
american
guest
bates
the
butler
was
elderly
and
severely
church
of
england
his
knowledge
of
widows
was
confined
to
the
type
ably
represented
by
his
mistress
and
he
regarded
young
loring
as
inclined
to
be
flighty
the
footman
who
was
entirely
under
the
butler
thumb
in
mundane
matters
had
fallen
into
the
habit
of
sharing
his
opinions
and
while
agreeing
in
the
general
feeling
of
flightiness
declared
boldly
that
the
lady
in
question
gave
a
certain
style
to
the
that
it
had
lacked
before
her
advent
for
a
helpless
victim
however
a
slave
bound
in
fetters
of
steel
one
would
have
to
know
cummins
the
under
housemaid
who
lighted
loring
fire
night
and
morning
she
was
young
shy
country
bred
and
new
to
service
when
benson
sent
her
to
the
guest
room
at
eight
on
the
morning
after
her
arrival
she
stopped
outside
the
door
in
a
panic
of
fear
come
in
called
a
cheerful
voice
come
in
cummins
entered
bearing
her
box
with
brush
and
cloth
and
kindlings
to
her
further
embarrassment
loring
was
sitting
up
in
bed
with
an
ermine
coat
on
over
which
her
bright
hair
fell
in
picturesque
disorder
she
had
brought
the
coat
for
theatre
and
opera
but
as
these
attractions
were
lacking
at
stoke
revel
and
as
life
there
was
to
her
one
prolonged
polar
expedition
with
dashes
farthest
north
morning
and
evening
she
had
diverted
it
to
practical
uses
make
me
a
quick
fire
please
a
big
fire
a
hot
fire
she
begged
or
i
shall
be
late
for
breakfast
i
never
can
step
into
that
tin
tub
till
the
ice
is
melted
there
no
ice
in
it
expostulated
cummins
gently
with
the
voice
of
a
wood
dove
you
ca
see
it
because
you
english
said
the
strange
lady
but
i
can
see
it
and
feel
it
oh
you
make
a
good
fire
what
is
your
name
please
cummins
there
another
cummins
downstairs
but
she
is
tall
and
large
you
shall
be
cummins
now
every
morning
the
shy
maid
palpitated
outside
the
bedroom
door
having
given
her
modest
knock
palpitated
for
fear
it
should
be
all
a
dream
but
no
it
was
not
there
would
be
a
come
in
and
then
as
she
entered
good
morning
little
cummins
i
been
longing
for
you
since
daybreak
a
trifle
later
on
it
was
good
little
cummins
bearing
coals
of
comfort
kind
little
cummins
and
other
strange
and
wonderful
terms
of
praise
until
little
cummins
felt
herself
consumed
by
a
passion
to
which
de
tracy
coals
became
as
less
than
naught
unless
they
could
be
heaped
on
the
altar
of
the
beloved
so
life
went
on
at
stoke
revel
outwardly
even
and
often
dull
while
in
reality
many
subtle
changes
were
taking
place
below
the
surface
changes
slight
in
themselves
but
not
without
meaning
robinette
ran
up
to
her
room
directly
after
breakfast
one
morning
and
pinned
on
her
hat
as
she
came
downstairs
mark
lavendar
had
gone
to
london
for
a
few
days
but
even
the
dullness
of
conversation
had
not
robbed
her
of
her
joy
in
the
early
sunshine
made
more
cheery
by
the
prospect
of
a
walk
with
carnaby
with
whom
she
was
now
fast
friends
carnaby
looked
at
her
beamingly
as
they
stood
together
on
the
steps
you
the
best
woman
of
my
acquaintance
he
said
approvingly
with
a
laughable
struggle
for
the
tone
of
a
man
of
the
world
how
many
ladies
of
fashion
do
you
know
my
child
enquired
robinetta
pulling
on
her
gloves
i
see
a
lot
of
off
and
on
carnaby
answered
somewhat
huffily
and
they
do
call
me
a
child
either
do
they
then
that
because
they
timid
and
do
dare
address
a
future
admiral
as
come
on
middy
dear
let
walk
robinette
wore
a
white
serge
dress
and
jacket
and
her
hat
was
a
rough
straw
turned
up
saucily
in
two
places
with
black
owls
heads
benson
and
little
cummins
had
looked
at
it
curiously
while
robinette
was
at
breakfast
is
black
underneath
and
white
on
top
benson
can
that
be
it
looks
as
if
one
been
clapped
on
another
that
what
it
is
cummins
it
a
double
hat
but
they
do
anything
in
america
it
a
double
hat
with
two
black
owls
heads
and
i
wager
they
charged
double
price
for
it
she
a
lovely
beauty
in
anythink
and
everythink
she
wears
said
little
cummins
loyally
may
i
call
you
robin
carnaby
asked
as
they
walked
along
robinette
is
such
a
long
name
cousin
robin
is
very
nice
i
think
she
answered
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
ought
to
be
your
aunt
robin
it
would
be
much
more
appropriate
aunt
be
blowed
ejaculated
carnaby
you
very
fond
of
making
yourself
out
old
but
it
no
go
when
i
first
heard
you
were
a
widow
i
thought
you
would
be
age
i
say
do
you
think
you
will
marry
another
time
cousin
robin
that
a
very
leading
question
for
a
gentleman
to
put
to
a
lady
were
you
intending
to
ask
me
to
wait
for
you
middy
dear
asked
robinette
putting
her
arm
in
the
boy
laughingly
quite
unconscious
of
his
mood
i
wait
quick
enough
if
you
let
me
i
wait
a
lifetime
there
never
was
anybody
like
you
in
the
world
the
words
were
said
half
under
the
boy
breath
and
the
emotion
in
his
tone
was
a
complete
and
disagreeable
surprise
here
was
something
that
must
be
nipped
in
the
bud
instantly
and
courageously
robinette
dropped
carnaby
arm
and
said
we
talk
that
over
at
once
middy
dear
but
first
you
shall
race
me
to
the
top
of
the
twisting
path
down
past
the
tulip
beds
to
the
seat
under
the
big
ash
come
on
the
two
reached
the
tree
in
a
moment
carnaby
sufficiently
in
advance
to
preserve
his
and
with
a
colour
heightened
by
something
other
than
the
exercise
of
running
sit
down
first
cousin
once
removed
said
robinette
do
you
know
the
story
of
sydney
smith
who
wrote
apologizing
to
somebody
for
not
being
able
to
come
to
dinner
house
is
full
of
cousins
he
said
they
were
once
removed
it
no
good
telling
me
literary
anecdotes
you
not
treating
me
fairly
said
carnaby
sulkily
i
treating
you
exactly
as
you
should
be
treated
robinette
answered
firmly
give
me
your
two
paws
and
look
me
straight
in
the
eye
carnaby
was
no
coward
his
eyes
blazed
as
he
met
his
cousin
look
carnaby
dear
do
you
know
what
you
are
to
me
you
are
my
kinsman
my
only
male
relation
i
so
fond
of
you
already
spoil
it
think
what
you
can
be
to
me
if
you
will
i
am
all
alone
in
the
world
and
when
you
grow
a
little
older
how
i
should
like
to
depend
upon
you
i
need
affection
so
do
you
dear
boy
ca
i
see
how
you
are
just
starving
for
it
there
is
no
reason
in
the
world
why
we
should
be
fond
of
each
other
oh
how
grateful
i
should
be
to
think
of
a
strong
young
middy
growing
up
to
advise
me
and
take
me
about
it
was
that
kind
of
care
and
thought
of
me
that
was
in
your
mind
just
now
you
be
marrying
somebody
one
of
these
days
blurted
carnaby
wholly
moved
but
only
half
convinced
then
you
forget
all
about
your
i
have
no
intention
in
that
direction
said
robinette
but
if
i
change
my
mind
i
consult
you
first
how
will
that
do
it
would
do
any
good
sighed
the
boy
so
i
rather
you
would
you
have
your
own
way
spite
of
everything
a
fellow
could
say
against
it
there
was
a
moment
of
embarrassment
then
the
silence
was
promptly
broken
by
robinette
well
middy
dear
are
we
the
best
of
friends
she
asked
rising
from
the
bench
and
putting
out
her
hand
the
lad
took
it
and
said
all
in
a
glow
of
chivalry
you
the
dearest
the
best
and
the
prettiest
cousin

thinking

prettiest

i
delight

it

your
ship
and
pour

tea
for
you

my
most
fetching
frock
your
friends
will
say

that
particularly
agreeable
lady
carnaby
and
you
with
swelling
chest
will
respond
my
american
cousin
loring
she
a
nice
creature
i
glad
you
like
her
robinette
imitation
of
carnaby
possible
pomposity
was
so
amusing
and
so
clever
that
it
drew
a
laugh
from
the
boy
in
spite
of
himself
just
let
anyone
try
to
call
you
a
he
exclaimed
have
me
to
reckon
with
oh
i
am
so
tired
of
being
a
boy
the
inside
of
me
is
all
grown
up
and
everybody
keeps
on
looking
at
the
outside
and
thinking
i
just
the
same
as
i
always
was
dear
old
middy
you
quite
old
enough
to
be
my
protector
and
that
is
what
you
shall
be
now
shall
we
go
in
i
want
you
to
stand
near
by
while
i
ask
your
grandmother
a
favor
she
wo
do
it
if
she
can
help
it
was
carnaby
succinct
reply
oh
i
am
not
sure
where
shall
we
find
her
in
the
library
yes
come
along
get
up
your
circulation
you
need
it
aunt
de
tracy
there
is
something
at
stoke
revel
i
am
very
anxious
to
have
if
you
will
give
it
to
me
said
robinette
as
she
came
into
the
library
a
few
minutes
later
de
tracy
looked
up
from
her
knitting
solemnly
if
it
belongs
to
me
i
shall
no
doubt
be
willing
as
i
know
you
would
not
ask
for
anything
out
of
the
common
but
i
own
little
here
nearly
all
is
carnaby
this
was
my
mother
said
robinette
it
is
a
picture
hanging
in
the
smoking
room
one
that
was
a
great
favorite
of
hers
called
her
found
an
italian
artist
in
london
who
went
to
the
national
gallery
and
made
a
copy
of
the
sir
joshua
picture
and
i
was
named
after
it
i
wish
your
mother
could
have
been
a
little
less
romantic
sighed
de
tracy
there
were
such
fine
old
family
names
she
might
have
used
marcia
and
elspeth
and
rosamond
and
winifred
i
am
sorry
aunt
de
tracy
if
i
had
been
consulted
i
believe
i
should
have
agreed
with
you
perhaps
when
my
mother
was
in
america
the
family
ties
were
not
drawn
as
tightly
as
in
the
former
years
if
it
was
so
it
was
only
natural
said
the
old
lady
however
if
you
ask
carnaby
and
if
the
picture
has
no
great
value
i
am
sure
he
will
wish
you
to
have
it
especially
if
you
know
it
to
have
been
your
mother
property
here
carnaby
sauntered
into
the
room
that
all
right
grandmother
he
said
i
heard
what
you
were
saying
only
i
wish
it
was
a
real
sir
joshua
we
were
giving
cousin
robin
instead
of
a
copy
thank
you
carnaby
dear
and
thank
you
too
aunt
de
tracy
you
think
how
much
it
is
to
me
to
have
this
it
is
a
precious
link
between
mother
girlhood
and
mother
and
me
so
saying
she
dropped
a
timid
kiss
upon
de
tracy
hair
and
left
the
room
if
she
could
live
in
england
long
enough
to
get
over
that
excessive
freedom
of
manner
your
cousin
would
be
quite
a
pleasing
person
but
i
am
afraid
it
goes
too
deep
to
be
cured
de
tracy
remarked
as
she
smoothed
the
hairs
that
might
have
been
ruffled
by
robinette
kiss
carnaby
made
no
reply
he
was
looking
out
into
the
garden
and
feeling
half
a
boy
half
a
man
but
wholly
though
not
very
contentedly
a
kinsman
xi
the
sands
at
weston
thursday
morning
is
it
possible
that
this
is
thursday
morning
and
i
must
run
up
to
london
on
saturday
said
lavendar
to
himself
as
he
finished
dressing
by
the
open
window
he
looked
up
the
day
of
the
week
in
his
calendar
first
in
order
to
make
quite
sure
of
the
fact
yes
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
that
it
was
thursday
his
sense
of
time
must
have
suffered
some
strange
confusion
in
one
way
it
seemed
only
an
hour
ago
that
he
had
arrived
from
the
clangour
and
darkness
of
london
to
the
silence
of
the
country
the
cuckoos
calling
across
the
river
between
the
wooded
hills
and
the
april
sunshine
on
the
orchard
trees
in
another
years
might
have
passed
since
the
moment
when
he
first
saw
robinette
loring
sitting
under
prettyman
plum
tree
eight
days
have
we
spent
together
in
this
house
and
yet
since
that
time
when
we
first
crossed
in
the
boat
i
never
been
more
than
half
an
hour
alone
with
her
he
thought
there
are
only
three
other
people
in
the
house
after
all
but
they
seem
to
have
the
power
of
multiplying
themselves
like
the
loaves
and
fishes
only
when
not
wanted
so
that
we
eternally
in
a
crowd
that
boy
particularly
i
like
carnaby
if
he
could
get
it
into
his
thick
head
that
his
presence
is
always
necessary
it
must
bother
loring
too
quite
off
his
head
about
her
if
she
only
knew
it
however
it
my
last
day
very
likely
and
if
i
have
to
outwit
machiavelli
i
manage
it
somehow
surely
one
lame
old
woman
and
a
torpid
machine
for
knitting
and
writing
notes
like
miss
smeardon
ca
want
to
be
out
of
doors
all
day
hang
that
boy
though
he
come
anywhere
here
he
stopped
and
sat
down
suddenly
at
the
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
in
comic
despair
loring
ca
like
it
she
must
be
doing
it
on
purpose
avoiding
being
alone
with
me
because
she
sees
i
admire
her
he
sighed
after
all
why
should
i
ever
suppose
that
i
interest
her
as
much
as
she
does
me
no
one
could
have
told
from
lavendar
face
when
he
appeared
fresh
and
smiling
at
the
breakfast
table
half
an
hour
later
that
he
was
hatching
any
schemes
robinette
entered
the
dining
room
five
minutes
late
as
usual
pretty
as
a
pink
breathless
with
hurrying
she
wore
a
white
dress
again
with
one
rose
stuck
at
her
waistband
a
little
tribute
from
the
gardener
she
said
as
she
noticed
lavendar
glance
at
it
she
went
rapidly
around
the
table
shaking
hands
and
gave
carnaby
red
cheeks
a
pinch
in
passing
that
made
lavendar
long
to
tweak
the
boy
ear
good
morning
all
she
said
cheerily
and
how
is
my
first
cousin
once
removed
is
he
going
to
weston
with
me
this
morning
to
buy
hairpins
he
is
carnaby
answered
joyfully
between
mouthfuls
of
bacon
and
eggs
he
has
been
out
of
hairpins
for
a
week
does
he
need
tapes
and
buttons
also
asked
robinette
taking
the
piece
of
muffin
from
his
hand
and
buttering
it
for
herself
an
act
highly
disapproved
of
by
de
tracy
who
hurriedly
requested
bates
to
pass
the
bread
he
needs
everything
you
need
carnaby
said
with
heightened
colour
my
hair
is
giving
me
a
good
deal
of
trouble
lately
remarked
lavendar
passing
his
hand
over
a
thickly
thatched
head
i
have
an
excellent
american
tonic
that
i
will
give
you
after
breakfast
said
robinette
roguishly
you
need
to
apply
it
with
a
brush
at
ten
eleven
and
twelve
sitting
in
the
sun
continuously
between
those
hours
so
that
the
scalp
may
be
well
invigorated
carnaby
will
you
buy
me
butter
scotch
and
lemonade
and
oranges
in
weston
i
will
if
grandmother
increase
my
allowance
said
carnaby
malevolently
for
i
need
every
penny
i
got
in
hand
for
the
hairpins
i
hope
you
are
not
hungry
robinetta
said
de
tracy
that
you
have
to
buy
food
in
weston
no
indeed
said
robinette
i
was
only
longing
to
test
generosity
and
educate
him
in
buying
trifles
for
pretty
ladies
he
can
probably
be
relied
on
to
educate
himself
in
that
line
when
the
time
comes
de
tracy
remarked
and
now
if
you
have
all
finished
talking
about
hair
i
will
take
up
my
breakfast
again
oh
aunt
de
tracy
i
am
so
sorry
if
it
was
a
nice
subject
but
i
never
thought
anyway
i
only
talked
about
hairpins
it
was
lavendar
who
introduced
hair
into
the
conversation
was
it
middy
dear
lavendar
thought
he
could
have
annihilated
them
both
for
their
open
comradeship
their
obvious
delight
in
each
other
society
was
he
to
be
put
on
the
shelf
like
a
dry
old
bachelor
not
he
he
would
circumvent
them
in
some
way
or
another
although
the
rôle
of
gooseberry
was
new
to
him
the
two
young
people
set
off
in
high
spirits
and
de
tracy
and
miss
smeardon
watched
them
as
they
walked
down
the
avenue
on
their
way
to
the
station
their
clasped
hands
swinging
in
a
merry
rhythm
as
they
hummed
a
bit
of
the
last
popular
song
i
hope
robinetta
will
not
americanize
carnaby
said
de
tracy
he
seems
so
foolishly
elated
so
feverishly
gay
all
at
once
her
manner
is
too
informal
carnaby
requires
constant
repression
perhaps
his
temperature
has
not
returned
to
normal
since
his
attack
of
quinsy
miss
smeardon
observed
reassuringly
meanwhile
lavendar
sat
in
admiral
de
tracy
old
smoking
room
for
half
an
hour
writing
letters
every
time
that
he
glanced
up
from
his
work
and
he
did
so
pretty
often
his
eyes
fell
on
a
picture
that
hung
upon
the
opposite
wall
it
was
the
copy
of
sir
joshua
robinetta
made
long
ago
and
just
presented
to
its
namesake
in
the
portrait
the
girl
hair
was
a
still
brighter
gold
yet
certainly
there
was
a
likeness
somewhere
about
it
he
thought
partly
in
the
expression
partly
in
the
broad
low
forehead
and
the
eyes
that
looked
as
if
they
were
seeing
fairies
of
course
to
his
mind
loring
was
a
hundred
times
more
lovely
than
sir
joshua
famous
girl
with
a
robin
he
felt
very
because
robinette
and
carnaby
had
deliberately
gone
for
an
excursion
without
him
and
had
left
him
toiling
over
business
papers
when
they
had
gone
off
to
enjoy
themselves
how
bright
it
was
out
there
in
the
sunshine
to
be
sure
and
why
should
it
be
carnaby
not
he
who
was
by
this
time
walking
along
the
sea
front
of
weston
and
watching
the
breeze
flutter
robinette
scarf
and
bring
a
brighter
colour
to
her
lips
there
the
last
words
were
written
and
taking
up
his
bunch
of
letters
watch
in
hand
he
sought
de
tracy
and
explained
that
he
would
bicycle
to
weston
and
catch
the
london
post
himself
i
send
william
she
began
but
lavendar
hastily
assured
her
that
he
should
enjoy
the
ride
and
hurried
off
in
triumph
miss
smeardon
smiled
an
acid
smile
as
she
watched
him
go
he
has
forgotten
all
about
poor
miss
meredith
i
suppose
she
murmured
yet
it
was
not
so
long
ago
that
they
were
supposed
to
be
all
in
all
to
each
other
it
was
a
foolish
engagement
miss
smeardon
said
de
tracy
in
a
cold
voice
i
never
thought
the
girl
was
suited
to
mark
and
i
understand
that
old
lavendar
was
relieved
when
the
whole
thing
came
to
an
end
quite
so
certainly
no
doubt
miss
meredith
would
never
have
made
him
happy
said
miss
smeardon
at
once
though
it
is
always
more
agreeable
when
the
lady
discovers
the
fact
first
in
this
case
she
confessed
openly
that
lavendar
broke
her
heart
with
his
indifference
she
was
an
young
woman
said
de
tracy
as
if
the
subject
were
now
closed
however
i
hope
that
the
son
of
my
family
solicitor
would
think
it
only
proper
to
pay
a
certain
amount
of
attention
to
the
admiral
niece
were
she
ever
so
obnoxious
to
him
miss
smeardon
made
no
audible
reply
but
her
thoughts
were
to
the
effect
that
never
was
an
obnoxious
duty
performed
by
any
man
with
a
better
grace
the
sea
front
at
weston
was
the
most
prosaic
scene
in
the
world
a
long
esplanade
with
an
asphalt
path
running
its
full
length
and
ugly
jerrybuilt
houses
glaring
out
upon
it
a
gimcrack
pier
with
a
gingerbread
sort
of
and
glass
house
at
the
end
all
that
could
have
been
done
to
ruin
nature
had
been
determinedly
done
there
but
you
can
not
ruin
a
spring
day
nor
youth
nor
the
colour
of
the
sea
along
the
level
shore
the
placid
waves
swept
and
broke
and
then
gathered
up
their
white
skirts
and
retreated
to
return
with
the
same
musical
laugh
children
and
dogs
played
about
on
the
wet
sands
the
wind
blew
freshly
and
the
sea
stretched
all
one
pure
blue
till
it
met
on
the
horizon
with
the
bluer
skies
weston
seemed
to
lavendar
a
very
fresh
and
delightful
spot
at
that
moment
although
had
he
been
in
a
different
mood
its
sordidness
only
would
have
struck
him
yes
there
they
were
in
the
distance
he
knew
robinette
white
dress
and
the
figure
of
the
boy
beside
her
hang
that
boy
were
they
really
going
to
buy
hairpins
if
so
then
a
he
must
find
lavendar
turned
up
the
little
street
that
led
from
the
scanning
all
the
signs
boots
dairies
vegetable
shops
heavens
were
there
nothing
but
vegetable
and
boot
shops
in
weston
boots
again
at
last
a
hairdresser
lavendar
stood
in
the
doorway
until
he
made
sure
that
robinette
and
the
middy
had
turned
in
that
direction
and
then
he
boldly
entered
the
shop
to
his
horror
he
found
himself
confronted
by
a
smiling
young
woman
whose
own
very
marvellous
erection
of
hair
made
him
think
she
must
be
used
as
an
advertisement
for
the
goods
she
supplied
in
another
moment
robinette
and
the
boy
would
be
upon
him
and
he
must
be
found
deep
in
fictitious
business
he
cast
one
agonized
glance
at
the
mysteries
of
the
toilet
that
surrounded
him
on
every
side
then
clearing
his
throat
he
said
modestly
but
firmly
that
he
wanted
to
buy
a
pair
of
curling
tongs
for
a
lady
these
are
the
thing
if
you
wish
a
marcel
wave
was
the
reply
but
just
for
an
ordinary
crimp
we
sell
a
good
many
of
the
plain
ones
yes
thank
you
they
will
do
the
lady
my
sister
also
wished
a
little
was
it
sir
she
moved
smilingly
to
a
drawer
a
few
pin
curls
are
very
easily
adjusted
or
would
our
guinea
switch
at
this
moment
the
boy
and
robinette
entered
the
shop
lavendar
was
paying
for
the
curling
tongs
and
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
relaxed
oh
here
you
are
i
have
just
finished
my
business
he
said
turning
round
i
thought
we
might
encounter
one
another
somewhere
robinette
and
carnaby
exchanged
knowing
glances
of
which
lavendar
was
perfectly
conscious
but
he
stood
by
while
loring
bought
her
hairpins
and
carnaby
endeavoured
to
persuade
her
to
invest
in
a
few
pin
curls
not
an
hour
before
it
is
absolutely
necessary
middy
dear
she
said
then
i
shall
bear
it
as
bravely
as
i
can
come
now
carry
the
hairpins
for
me
and
let
me
take
lavendar
out
of
this
shop
or
he
will
be
tempted
to
buy
more
than
he
needs
oh
no
lavendar
remarked
pointedly
i
have
what
i
came
for
do
forget
your
parcel
carnaby
exclaimed
darting
after
lavendar
as
they
went
into
the
street
you
left
it
on
the
counter
how
careless
said
mark
it
was
for
my
sister
you
never
told
me
you
had
a
sister
said
robinette
as
they
walked
together
lavendar
wheeling
his
bicycle
and
carnaby
sulking
behind
them
i
am
blessed
with
two
one
married
now
the
other
my
sister
amy
lives
at
home
well
you
see
in
spite
of
all
our
questions
the
first
time
we
met
we
really
know
very
little
about
each
other
she
went
on
lightly
it
takes
such
a
long
time
to
get
thoroughly
acquainted
in
this
country
do
they
ever
count
you
a
friend
if
you
do
not
know
all
their
aunts
and
second
cousins

laughed
willingly
would
i
introduce
you
to
my
aunts
and
my
uttermost
cousins
and
lay
the
map
of
my
life
before
you
uneventful
as
it
has
been
if
that
would
further
our
acquaintance
even
as
he
spoke
a
hateful
memory
darted
into
his
thoughts
and
he
reddened
to
his
temples
until
loring
wondered
if
she
had
said
anything
to
annoy
him
some
fortunate
accident
at
this
point
ordered
that
carnaby
should
meet
a
friend
another
middy
about
his
own
age
and
they
set
off
together
in
quest
of
a
third
boy
who
was
supposed
to
be
in
the
near
neighbourhood
as
soon
as
the
lads
were
out
of
sight
lavendar
found
the
jests
they
had
been
bandying
together
die
on
his
lips
i
going
down
deeper
i
shall
be
out
of
my
depth
very
soon
he
thought
to
himself
as
he
walked
in
silence
by
robinette
side
let
us
come
down
to
the
beach
again
we
ca
go
to
the
station
for
half
an
hour
yet
she
said
i
like
to
look
out
to
sea
and
realize
that
if
i
sailed
long
enough
i
could
step
off
that
pier
and
arrive
in
america
they
stood
by
the
together
with
the
fresh
wind
playing
on
their
faces
is
it
curious
said
robinette
how
instinctively
one
always
turns
to
look
at
the
sea
inland
may
be
ever
so
lovely
but
if
the
sea
is
there
we
generally
look
in
that
direction
because
it
is
unbounded
like
the
future
said
lavendar
he
was
looking
as
he
spoke
at
some
children
playing
on
the
sands
just
beside
them
there
was
a
gallant
little
boy
among
them
with
a
bare
curly
head
who
refused
help
from
older
sisters
and
was
toiling
away
at
his
sand
castle
his
whole
soul
in
his
work
throwing
up
spadefuls
tremendous
ones
for
four
years
old
upon
its
ramparts
as
if
certain
they
could
resist
the
advancing
tide
what
a
noble
little
fellow
exclaimed
robinette
catching
the
direction
of
lavendar
glance
is
he
splendid
toiling
like
that
stumping
about
on
those
fat
brown
legs
how
beautiful
to
have
a
child
like
that
of
one
own
thought
lavendar
as
he
looked
on
the
sands
around
them
there
were
numbers
of
such
children
playing
there
in
the
sun
it
seemed
a
happy
world
to
him
at
the
moment
suddenly
he
saw
his
companion
turn
quickly
aside
a
nurse
in
uniform
came
towards
them
pushing
not
a
happy
crooning
baby
this
time
but
a
little
emaciated
wisp
of
a
child
lying
back
wearily
in
a
wheel
chair
something
in
robinette
face
or
perhaps
the
bit
of
fluttering
lace
she
wore
upon
her
white
dress
had
attracted
its
notice
and
it
stretched
out
two
tiny
skeleton
hands
towards
her
as
it
passed
with
a
quick
gesture
brushing
tears
away
that
in
a
moment
had
rushed
to
her
eyes
young
loring
stepped
forward
and
put
her
fingers
into
the
wasted
hands
that
were
held
out
to
her
she
hung
above
the
child
for
a
moment
a
radiant
figure
her
face
shining
with
sympathy
and
a
sort
of
heavenly
kindness
her
eyes
the
sweeter
for
their
tears
what
is
it
darling
she
asked
oh
it
the
bright
rose
then
she
hurriedly
unfastened
the
flower
from
her
and
turned
to
lavendar
will
you
please
take
your
penknife
and
scrape
away
all
the
little
thorns
she
asked
the
rose
looked
very
charming
where
it
was
he
remarked
half
regretfully
as
he
did
what
she
commanded
it
will
look
better
still
presently
she
answered
the
child
hands
were
outstretched
longingly
to
grasp
the
flower
its
eyes
unnaturally
deep
and
wise
with
pain
were
fixed
upon
face
she
bent
over
the
chair
and
her
voice
was
like
a
dove
voice
lavendar
thought
as
she
spoke
then
the
little
melancholy
carriage
was
wheeled
away
motherhood
always
seemed
the
most
sacred
the
supreme
experience
to
robinette
a
thing
high
and
beautiful
like
the
topmost
blooms
of
nurse
prettyman
plum
tree
if
one
had
to
choose
between
that
sturdy
boy
and
this
wistful
wraith
it
would
be
hard
she
thought
all
my
pride
would
run
out
to
the
boy
but
i
could
die
for
love
and
pity
if
this
suffering
baby
were
mine
lavendar
had
turned
and
leaned
on
the
wall
with
averted
face
sweet
woman
he
was
saying
to
himself
it
is
more
than
a
merry
heart
that
is
able
to
give
such
sympathy
it
a
sad
old
world
after
all
where
such
things
can
be
but
a
woman
like
that
can
bring
good
out
of
evil
robinette
had
seated
herself
on
a
low
wall
beside
him
her
little
embroidered
futility
of
a
handkerchief
was
in
her
hand
once
more
a
rose
and
a
smile
that
all
we
could
give
it
she
said
and
we
would
either
of
us
share
some
of
that
burden
if
we
only
could
she
watched
the
merry
healthy
children
playing
beside
them
and
added
after
all
let
us
comfort
ourselves
that
brown
cheeks
and
fat
legs
are
in
the
majority
rightness
somehow
or
other
must
be
at
the
root
of
things
or
we
should
be
a
living
world
at
all
amen
said
lavendar
but
the
sight
of
suffering
innocents
like
that
sometimes
makes
me
wish
i
were
dead
dead
she
echoed
why
it
makes
me
wish
for
a
hundred
lives
a
hundred
hearts
and
hands
to
feel
with
and
help
with
ah
some
women
are
made
that
way
my
stepmother
the
only
mother
known
was
like
that
lavendar
went
on
dropping
suddenly
again
into
personal
talk
as
they
had
done
before
he
and
she
it
seemed
could
not
keep
barriers
between
them
very
long
every
hour
they
spent
together
brought
them
more
strangely
into
knowledge
of
each
past
she
was
a
fine
woman
he
went
on
with
a
certain
comfortable
breadth
about
her
of
mind
and
body
and
those
large
warm
capable
hands
that
seem
so
fitted
to
lift
burdens
lavendar
was
in
an
mood
and
never
much
given
to
noting
details
at
any
time
he
bent
over
on
the
low
wall
in
retrospective
silence
looking
at
the
blue
sea
before
them
robinette
who
was
perched
beside
him
spread
her
two
small
hands
on
her
white
serge
knees
and
regarded
them
fixedly
for
a
moment
i
wonder
if
it
a
matter
of
size
she
said
after
a
moment
i
wonder
let
be
confidential
when
i
was
a
little
girl
we
were
not
at
all
and
my
hands
were
very
busy
my
father
success
came
to
him
only
two
or
three
years
before
his
death
when
his
reputation
began
to
grow
and
his
plans
for
great
public
buildings
began
to
be
accepted
so
i
was
my
mother
helper
we
had
but
one
servant
and
i
learned
to
make
beds
to
dust
to
wipe
dishes
to
make
tea
and
coffee
and
to
cook
simple
dishes
if
admiral
de
tracy
sister
had
to
work
admiral
de
tracy
niece
was
certainly
going
to
help
later
on
came
my
father
illness
and
death
we
had
plenty
of
servants
then
but
my
hands
had
learned
to
be
busy
i
gave
him
his
medicines
i
changed
his
pillows
i
opened
his
letters
and
answered
such
of
them
as
were
within
my
powers
i
fanned
him
i
stroked
his
aching
head
the
end
came
and
mother
and
i
had
hardly
begun
to
take
hold
of
life
again
when
her
health
failed
i
was
enough
for
her
she
needed
father
and
her
face
was
bent
towards
him
my
hands
were
busy
again
for
months
and
they
held
my
mother
when
she
died
time
went
on
then
i
began
again
to
make
a
home
out
of
a
house
to
use
my
strength
and
time
as
a
good
wife
should
for
the
comfort
of
her
husband
but
oh
so
faultily
for
i
was
all
too
young
and
inexperienced
it
was
only
for
a
few
months
then
death
came
into
my
life
for
the
third
time
and
i
was
less
than
twenty
for
the
first
time
since
i
can
remember
my
hands
are
idle
but
it
will
not
be
for
long
i
want
them
to
be
busy
always
i
want
them
to
be
full
i
want
them
to
be
tired
i
want
them
ready
to
do
the
tasks
my
head
and
heart
suggest
lavendar
had
a
strong
desire
to
take
those
same
hands
in
his
and
kiss
them
but
instead
he
rose
and
spread
out
his
own
long
brown
fingers
on
the
edge
of
the
wall
a
man
hands
fine
and
supple
but
meant
to
work
i
seem
to
have
done
nothing
he
exclaimed
you
look
so
young
so
irresponsible
so
like
a
bird
on
a
bough
that
i
can
not
associate
dull
care
with
you
yet
you
have
lived
more
deeply
than
i
life
seems
to
have
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
and
passed
me
by
these
hands
of
mine
have
never
done
a
real
day
work
loring
for
they
been
the
servants
of
an
unwilling
brain
i
hated
my
own
work
as
a
younger
man
and
though
i
hope
i
did
not
shirk
it
i
certainly
did
nothing
that
i
could
avoid
he
paused
and
went
on
slowly
i
thought
sometimes
of
late
i
mean
that
if
life
is
to
be
worth
much
if
it
is
to
be
real
life
and
not
mere
existence
one
must
put
one
whole
heart
into
it
and
that
two
people
he
stopped
he
was
silent
with
embarrassment
conscious
of
having
said
too
much
can
help
each
other
indeed
they
can
loring
went
on
serenely
if
they
have
the
same
ideals
hardly
anyone
fortunately
is
so
alone
as
i
and
so
i
have
to
help
myself
your
sisters
now
do
they
help
not
a
great
deal
lavendar
confessed
one
would
but
she
married
and
in
india
worse
luck
the
other
is
well
she
a
candid
sister
he
laughed
and
looked
up
if
my
best
friend
could
hear
my
sister
amy
view
of
me
just
have
a
little
sketch
of
me
by
amy
without
fear
or
favour
he
or
she
would
never
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
me
again
and
i
am
not
sure
but
that
i
should
agree
with
her
nonsense
my
dear
friend
exclaimed
robinette
in
a
maternal
tone
she
sometimes
affected
a
tone
fairly
agonizing
to
mark
lavendar
we
should
never
belittle
the
stuff
that
been
put
into
us
my
equipment
is
particularly
large
but
i
am
going
to
squeeze
every
ounce
of
power
from
it
before
i
die
life
is
extraordinarily
interesting
to
you
is
it
interesting
it
is
thrilling
so
will
it
be
to
you
when
you
make
up
your
mind
to
squeeze
it
said
robinette
jumping
off
the
wall
there
is
carnaby
signalling
it
is
time
we
went
to
the
station
life
would
thrill
me
considerably
more
if
carnaby
were
not
eternally
in
evidence
said
lavendar
but
robinette
pretended
not
to
hear
xii
love
in
the
mud
the
next
day
robinette
was
once
more
sitting
in
the
boat
opposite
to
lavendar
as
he
rowed
they
were
going
down
the
river
this
time
not
across
it
somehow
they
had
managed
that
afternoon
to
get
out
by
themselves
which
sounds
very
simple
but
is
a
wonderfully
difficult
thing
to
accomplish
when
there
is
no
special
reason
for
it
and
when
there
are
several
other
people
in
the
house
fortunately
de
tracy
did
not
like
to
be
alone
so
that
wherever
she
went
miss
smeardon
had
to
go
too
and
there
happened
to
be
a
sale
of
work
at
a
neighbouring
vicarage
that
afternoon
where
she
considered
her
presence
a
necessity
robinette
had
vanished
soon
after
luncheon
and
the
middy
had
been
dull
so
after
loitering
around
for
a
while
he
too
had
disappeared
upon
some
errand
of
his
own
lavendar
walked
very
slowly
toward
the
avenue
gateway
then
he
turned
and
came
back
he
could
scarcely
believe
his
good
fortune
when
he
saw
loring
come
out
of
the
house
and
pause
at
the
door
as
if
uncertain
of
her
next
movements
she
looked
uncommonly
lovely
in
a
white
frock
with
touches
of
blue
while
the
ribbon
in
her
hair
brought
out
all
its
gold
she
wore
a
flowery
garden
hat
and
a
pair
of
dainty
most
shoes
peeped
from
beneath
her
short
skirt
are
you
going
out
or
can
i
take
you
on
the
river
lavendar
asked
trying
without
much
success
to
conceal
the
eagerness
that
showed
in
his
voice
and
eyes
robinette
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
him
it
seemed
as
if
she
read
him
like
a
book
and
then
she
said
frankly
why
yes
there
is
nothing
i
should
like
so
much
but
where
is
carnaby
hang
carnaby
i
mean
i
do
know
or
care
i
had
too
much
of
his
society
to
be
pining
for
it
now
well
he
does
chatter
like
a
magpie
but
i
feel
he
must
have
such
a
dull
time
here
with
no
one
anywhere
near
his
own
age
elderly
as
i
am
i
seem
a
bit
nearer
than
aunt
de
tracy
or
miss
smeardon
aunt
de
tracy
all
the
same
will
never
understand
my
relations
with
that
boy
or
with
anyone
else
for
that
matter
i
did
try
so
hard
she
went
on
when
i
first
arrived
just
to
strike
the
right
note
with
her
and
i
missed
it
all
the
time
by
that
very
fact
no
doubt
i
so
unused
to
trying
at
home
you
mean
in
america
yes
of
course
i
do
try
there
at
all
and
yet
my
friends
seem
to
understand
me
does
it
seem
to
you
that
you
could
ever
call
england
i
could
not
have
believed
that
england
would
so
sink
into
my
heart
she
said
sitting
down
in
the
doorway
and
arranging
the
flowers
on
her
hat
during
those
first
dull
wet
days
when
i
was
still
a
stranger
and
when
i
looked
out
all
the
time
at
the
dripping
cedars
and
felt
whenever
i
opened
my
lips
that
i
said
the
wrong
thing
it
seemed
to
me
i
should
never
be
gay
for
an
hour
in
this
country
but
the
last
enchanting
sunny
days
have
changed
all
that
i
remember
it
my
mother
country
and
if
only
i
could
have
found
a
little
affection
waiting
for
me
all
would
have
been
perfect
you
may
find
it
yet
lavendar
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
help
saying
the
words
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
tone
in
which
he
said
them
to
make
robinette
conscious
of
his
meaning
i
afraid
not
she
sighed
thinking
of
de
tracy
indifference
i
much
more
american
than
english
much
more
my
father
daughter
than
the
admiral
niece
perhaps
my
aunt
feels
that
instinctively
now
i
must
slip
upstairs
and
change
if
we
are
going
boating
never
cried
lavendar
if
i
do
snatch
you
this
moment
from
the
devouring
crowd
i
shall
lose
you
i
will
keep
you
safe
and
dry
never
fear
and
we
shall
be
back
well
before
dark
they
went
down
the
river
after
leaving
the
little
pier
passing
the
orchards
heaped
on
the
hillsides
above
wittisham
and
lavendar
wanted
to
row
out
to
sea
but
robinette
preferred
the
river
so
he
rowed
nearer
to
the
shore
where
the
current
was
less
swift
and
the
boat
rocked
and
drifted
with
scarcely
a
touch
of
the
oars
they
had
talked
for
some
time
and
then
a
silence
had
fallen
which
robinette
broke
by
saying
i
half
wish
you
forsake
the
law
and
follow
lines
of
lesser
resistance
lavendar
do
you
know
you
seem
to
me
to
be
drifting
not
rowing
i
been
thinking
ever
since
of
what
you
said
to
me
on
the
sands
at
weston
ungrateful
woman
he
exclaimed
trying
to
evade
the
subject
when
these
two
faithful
arms
have
been
at
your
service
every
day
since
we
first
met
think
of
the
pennies
you
would
have
taken
from
that
tiny
gold
purse
of
yours
for
the
public
ferry
however
i
know
what
you
mean
i
never
met
anyone
so
as
you
robin
i
forgotten
i
assure
you
how
about
the
candid
sister
is
she
oh
she
attacks
the
outside
of
the
cup
and
platter
you
question
motive
power
and
ideals
well
i
confess
i
have
less
of
the
former
than
i
ought
and
more
of
the
latter
than
i
ever
used
lavendar
had
rested
on
his
oars
now
and
was
looking
down
so
that
the
twinkle
of
his
eyes
was
lost
i
suppose
i
shall
go
on
as
i
have
done
hitherto
doing
my
work
in
a
sort
of
a
way
and
getting
a
certain
amount
of
pleasure
out
of
things
unless
oh
but
that
not
living
she
exclaimed
that
only
existing
do
you
remember
it
is
not
growing
like
a
tree
in
bulk
doth
make
man
better
be
it
really
i
mean
forgetting
the
things
that
are
behind
and
going
on
and
on
to
something
ahead
whatever
one
aim
may
be
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
yourself
if
i
may
ask
said
lavendar
do
be
too
philanthropic
will
you
you
so
delightfully
symmetrical
now
i
shall
have
plenty
to
do
cried
robinette
ardently
i
told
you
before
i
have
so
much
motive
power
that
i
do
know
how
to
use
it
how
about
sharing
a
little
of
it
with
a
friend
lavendar
voice
was
full
of
meaning
but
robinette
refused
to
hear
it
she
had
succumbed
as
quickly
to
his
charm
as
he
to
hers
but
while
she
still
had
command
over
her
heart
she
did
not
intend
parting
with
it
unless
she
could
give
it
wholly
she
knew
enough
of
her
own
nature
to
recognize
that
she
longed
for
a
rowing
not
a
drifting
mate
and
that
nothing
else
would
content
her
but
her
instinct
urged
that
lavendar
indecisions
and
his
uncertainties
of
aim
were
accidents
rather
than
temperamental
weaknesses
she
suspected
that
his
introspective
moods
and
his
occasional
lack
of
spirits
had
a
definite
cause
unknown
to
her
i
have
a
large
income
she
said
after
a
moment
silence
changing
the
subject
arbitrarily
and
thereby
reducing
her
companion
to
a
temporary
state
of
silent
rage
yet
no
one
would
expect
a
woman
like
this
to
fall
like
a
ripe
plum
into
a
man
mouth
he
thought
presently
she
will
drop
only
when
she
has
quite
made
up
her
mind
and
the
bough
will
need
a
good
deal
of
shaking
i
have
a
large
income
repeated
robinette
while
lavendar
was
silent
only
five
thousand
dollars
a
year
which
is
of
course
microscopic
from
the
american
standpoint
and
cost
of
living
so
i
ca
build
free
libraries
and
swimming
baths
and
playgrounds
or
do
any
big
splendid
things
but
i
can
do
dear
little
nice
ones
left
undone
by
city
governments
and
by
the
millionaires
i
can
sing
and
read
and
study
i
can
travel
and
there
are
always
people
needing
something
wherever
you
are
if
you
have
eyes
to
see
them
one
live
a
useless
life
even
if
one
has
any
responsibilities
but
she
paused
i
been
talking
all
this
time
about
my
own
plans
and
ambitions
and
i
began
by
asking
yours
is
it
strange
that
the
moment
one
feels
conscious
of
friendship
one
begins
to
want
to
know
things
my
sister
amy
would
tell
you
i
had
no
ambitions
except
to
buy
as
many
books
as
i
wish
and
not
to
have
to
work
too
hard
said
mark
smiling
but
i
think
that
would
not
be
quite
true
i
have
some
of
a
dull
inferior
kind
not
beautiful
ones
like
yours
do
tell
me
what
they
are
he
shook
his
head
i
could
they
not
for
show
shabby
things
like
unsuccessful
poor
relations
who
would
rather
not
have
too
much
notice
taken
of
them
in
a
few
weeks
i
am
going
to
drag
them
out
of
their
retreat
brighten
them
up
inject
some
poetry
into
their
veins
and
then
display
them
to
your
critical
judgment
they
were
almost
at
a
standstill
now
and
neither
of
them
was
noticing
it
at
all
as
loring
moved
her
seat
the
boat
lurched
somewhat
to
one
side
mark
to
steady
her
placed
his
hand
over
hers
as
it
rested
on
the
rail
and
she
did
not
withdraw
it
then
he
found
the
other
hand
that
lay
upon
her
knee
and
took
it
in
his
own
scarcely
knowing
what
he
did
he
looked
into
her
face
and
found
no
anger
there
i
wish
to
tell
you
more
about
myself
he
stammered
something
not
altogether
creditable
to
me
but
perhaps
you
will
understand
perhaps
even
if
you
do
understand
you
will
forgive
she
drew
her
hands
gently
away
from
his
grasp
i
shall
try
to
understand
you
may
rely
on
that
she
said
i
not
going
to
trouble
you
with
any
very
dreadful
confessions
he
said
only
it
better
to
hear
things
directly
from
the
people
concerned
and
you
are
sure
to
hear
a
wrong
version
sooner
or
later
then
stopping
suddenly
he
exclaimed
hullo
we
stuck
i
declare
look
at
that
robinette
turned
and
saw
that
their
boat
was
now
scarcely
surrounded
with
water
at
all
on
every
side
as
if
the
flanks
of
some
great
whale
were
upheaving
from
below
there
appeared
stretches
of
glistening
mud
just
in
front
of
them
where
there
still
was
a
channel
of
water
was
an
upstanding
rock
shall
we
row
quickly
there
she
cried
then
perhaps
we
can
get
out
and
pull
the
boat
to
the
other
side
where
there
is
more
water
what
has
happened
oh
something
not
unusual
said
lavendar
grimly
that
i
a
fool
and
the
has
ebbed
as
tides
have
been
known
to
do
before
afraid
a
man
does
watch
tides
when
he
has
a
companion
like
you
now
we
left
high
but
not
at
all
dry
as
you
see
till
the
tide
turns
by
a
swift
stroke
or
two
he
managed
to
propel
their
craft
as
far
as
the
rock
they
scrambled
up
on
it
and
then
he
tried
to
haul
the
boat
around
the
miniature
islet
but
the
more
he
hauled
the
quicker
the
water
seemed
to
run
away
and
the
deeper
the
wretched
thing
stuck
in
the
mud
he
jumped
in
again
and
made
an
effort
to
push
her
off
with
an
oar
meanwhile
robinette
nearly
fell
off
the
rock
in
her
efforts
to
get
the
head
of
the
boat
around
towards
the
current
again
and
making
a
frantic
plunge
into
the
ooze
sank
above
her
ankles
in
an
instant
lavendar
caught
hold
of
her
and
helped
her
to
scramble
back
into
the
boat
it
all
right
only
my
skirt
wet
and
one
shoe
gone
she
panted
now
what
are
we
to
do
she
spread
out
her
hands
in
dismay
and
looked
down
at
her
draggled
skirt
her
little
feet
one
shoeless
and
both
covered
with
mud
and
slime
what
an
object
i
shall
be
to
meet
aunt
de
tracy
eye
when
if
ever
it
does
light
on
me
again
meanwhile
it
seems
as
if
we
might
be
here
for
some
hours
the
boat
is
just
settling
herself
into
the
mud
bank
like
a
rather
tired
fat
old
woman
into
an
armchair
and
pray
lavendar
what
do
you
propose
to
do
as
talleyrand
said
to
the
lady
who
told
him
she
could
bear
it
lavendar
looked
about
them
the
main
bed
of
the
river
was
fifty
yards
away
between
it
and
them
was
now
only
an
expanse
of
mud
it
perfectly
hopeless
he
said
the
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
beget
some
philosophy
which
at
any
moment
we
would
exchange
for
a
foot
of
water
she
interpolated
we
must
just
sit
here
and
wait
for
the
tide
shall
it
be
in
the
boat
or
on
the
rock
i
do
see
much
difference
do
you
except
that
the
passing
boats
if
there
are
any
might
think
it
was
a
matter
of
choice
to
sit
on
a
damp
rock
for
two
hours
but
no
one
could
think
we
wanted
to
sit
in
a
boat
in
the
mud
they
landed
on
the
rock
for
the
second
time
for
my
part
it
no
great
punishment
said
lavendar
when
they
settled
themselves
since
the
place
is
big
enough
for
two
and
you
one
of
them
would
this
be
as
good
a
stool
of
repentance
from
which
to
confess
your
faults
as
any
asked
robinette
as
she
tucked
her
shoeless
foot
beneath
her
skirt
and
made
herself
as
comfortable
as
possible
i
even
offer
a
return
of
confidence
upon
my
own
weaknesses
if
i
can
find
them
but
at
present
only
miles
of
virtue
stretch
behind
me
ugh
how
the
mud
smells
quite
penitential
now
what
have
you
sought
you
should
have
shunned
and
into
what
new
follies
run
oh
what
a
bad
rhyme
said
lavendar
it
pythagoras
any
way
she
explained
then
suddenly
changing
his
tone
lavendar
went
on
this
is
not
merely
a
jest
loring
before
you
admit
me
really
amongst
the
number
of
your
friends
i
should
like
you
to
know
that
to
put
it
plainly
my
own
little
world
would
tell
you
at
the
moment
that
i
am
a
heartless
jilt
that
is
a
very
ugly
expression
lavendar
and
i
shall
choose
not
to
believe
it
until
you
give
me
your
own
version
of
the
story
in
one
way
i
can
give
you
no
other
except
that
i
was
just
fool
enough
to
drift
into
an
engagement
with
a
woman
whom
i
did
not
really
love
and
just
not
enough
of
a
fool
to
make
both
of
us
miserable
for
life
when
i
all
too
late
found
out
my
mistake
there
passed
before
him
at
that
moment
other
foolish
blithe
little
loves
like
faded
flowers
with
the
sweetness
gone
out
of
them
they
had
been
so
innocent
so
fragile
so
free
from
blame
all
but
the
last
and
this
last
it
was
that
threatened
to
rise
like
a
shadow
perhaps
and
defeat
his
winning
the
only
woman
he
could
ever
love
robinette
stared
at
the
stretches
of
ooze
and
then
stole
a
look
at
mark
lavendar
the
idea
of
calling
that
man
a
jilt
she
thought
look
at
his
eyes
look
at
his
mouth
listen
to
his
voice
there
is
truth
in
them
all
oh
for
a
sight
of
the
girl
he
jilted
how
much
it
would
explain
no
not
altogether
because
the
careless
making
of
his
engagement
would
have
to
be
accounted
for
as
well
as
the
breaking
of
it
unless
he
did
it
merely
to
oblige
her
and
men
are
such
idiots
sometimes
then
he
must
have
fancied
he
was
in
love
with
her
perhaps
he
is
continually
troubled
with
those
fancies
nonsense
you
believe
in
him
and
you
know
you
do
then
aloud
she
said
sympathetically
i
afraid
we
are
apt
to
make
these
little
experimental
journeys
in
youth
when
the
heart
is
full
of
we
start
out
on
them
so
lightly
then
they
lead
nowhere
and
the
walking
back
alone
is
wearisome
and
depressing
my
return
journey
was
depressing
enough
at
first
said
lavendar
because
the
particular
she
was
unkinder
to
me
than
i
deserved
even
but
better
counsels
have
prevailed
and
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
meet
the
reproachful
gaze
of
stout
matrons
and
sour
spinsters
more
easily
than
i
have
for
a
year
past
you
see
the
two
families
were
friends
and
each
family
had
a
large
and
interested
connection
if
the
opinion
of
a
comparative
stranger
is
of
any
use
to
you
said
robinette
standing
on
the
rock
and
scraping
her
stockinged
foot
free
of
mud
believe
in
you
personally
you
do
seem
a
bit
to
me
i
let
you
marry
my
sister
and
no
questions
asked
i
did
know
you
had
a
sister
cried
lavendar
i
have
that
only
a
figure
of
speech
just
a
phrase
to
show
my
confidence
and
is
it
ungrateful
to
be
obliged
to
say
i
ca
marry
your
sister
after
you
have
given
me
permission
to
ask
her
not
only
ungrateful
but
unreasonable
said
robinette
saucily
turning
her
head
to
look
up
the
river
and
discovering
from
her
point
of
vantage
a
moving
object
around
the
curve
that
led
her
to
make
hazardous
remarks
knowing
rescue
was
not
far
away
what
have
you
against
my
sister
pray
very
little
he
said
daringly
knowing
well
that
she
held
him
in
her
hand
and
could
make
him
dumb
or
let
him
speak
at
any
moment
she
desired
almost
nothing
only
that
is
not
offering
me
sister
as
a
balm
to
my
woes
she
no
sister
she
is
an
only
child
there
there
cried
robinette
the
tide
is
coming
up
again
and
the
mud
banks
off
in
that
direction
are
all
covered
with
water
i
see
somebody
in
a
boat
rowing
towards
us
with
superhuman
energy
oh
if
i
had
worn
a
white
dress
it
will
come
smooth
and
my
lovely
french
hat
is
ruined
by
the
dampness
my
one
shoe
shows
how
inappropriately
i
was
shod
and
whoever
is
coming
will
say
it
is
because
i
am
an
american
he
will
never
know
you
would
let
me
go
upstairs
and
dress
properly
it
does
matter
anyway
rejoined
mark
because
it
is
only
carnaby
coming
you
might
know
he
would
find
us
even
if
we
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
river
xiii
carnaby
to
the
rescue
at
stoke
revel
in
the
meantime
the
solemn
rites
of
dinner
had
been
inaugurated
as
usual
by
the
sounding
of
the
gong
at
seven
de
tracy
miss
smeardon
and
bates
waited
five
minutes
in
silent
resignation
then
carnaby
came
down
and
was
scolded
for
being
late
but
there
was
no
robinette
and
no
lavendar
carnaby
said
his
grandmother
do
you
know
where
mark
intended
going
this
afternoon
no
i
do
said
carnaby
sulkily
your
cousin
robinetta
with
meaning
perhaps
you
know
her
whereabouts
not
i
replied
carnaby
with
affected
nonchalance
i
was
ferreting
with
wilson
he
had
ferreted
perhaps
for
fifteen
minutes
and
then
spent
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
in
solitary
discontent
but
he
would
not
have
owned
it
for
the
world
call
bates
commanded
de
tracy
bates
entered
do
you
know
if
lavendar
intended
going
any
distance
did
he
leave
any
message
lavendar
said
bates
lavendar
and
loring
they
went
out
in
the
boat
after
tea
lavendar
asked
william
for
the
key
and
william
he
went
down
and
got
out
the
oars
and
rudder
does
william
know
where
they
went
asked
de
tracy
in
high
displeasure
was
it
to
wittisham
no
william
says
they
went
down
stream
he
thinks
perhaps
they
were
going
to
the
flag
rock
and
he
says
the
gentleman
would
have
a
hard
pull
as
the
tide
was
going
out
but
lavendar
knows
the
river
well
as
well
as
carnaby
here
then
i
conclude
there
is
no
immediate
cause
for
anxiety
said
de
tracy
with
satire
you
can
serve
dinner
bates
there
seems
no
reason
why
we
should
fast
as
yet
however
carnaby
she
continued
as
the
men
can
not
be
spared
at
this
hour
you
had
better
go
at
once
and
see
what
has
happened
to
our
guests
right
you
are
cried
carnaby
with
the
utmost
alacrity
he
was
hungry
but
the
prospect
of
escape
was
better
than
food
he
rushed
away
and
his
boat
was
in
before
de
tracy
and
miss
smeardon
had
finished
their
tepid
soup
a
very
slim
young
moon
was
just
rising
above
the
woods
but
her
tender
light
cast
no
shadows
as
yet
and
there
were
no
stars
in
the
sky
for
it
was
daylight
still
the
evening
air
was
very
fresh
and
cool
there
was
no
wind
and
the
edges
of
the
river
were
motionless
and
smooth
although
in
the
now
tide
clucked
and
swirled
as
it
met
the
rush
over
at
wittisham
one
or
two
lights
were
beginning
to
twinkle
and
there
came
drifting
across
the
water
a
smell
of
wood
smoke
that
suggested
evening
fires
carnaby
handled
a
boat
well
for
he
had
been
born
a
sailor
as
it
were
and
his
long
powerful
strokes
took
him
along
at
a
fine
pace
but
although
he
was
going
to
look
for
robinette
and
mark
he
was
rather
angry
with
both
of
them
and
in
no
hurry
he
rested
on
his
oars
indifferently
and
let
the
tide
carry
him
up
as
it
liked
while
with
infinite
zest
he
unearthed
a
cigarette
case
from
the
recesses
of
his
person
lit
a
cigarette
and
smoked
it
coolly
under
carnaby
apparent
boyishness
there
was
a
certain
somewhat
dangerous
quality
of
precocity
which
was
stimulated
rather
than
checked
by
his
grandmother
repressive
system
his
smoking
now
was
less
the
of
a
boy
than
an
act
of
slightly
cynical
defiance
he
was
no
novice
in
the
art
and
smoked
slowly
and
daintily
throwing
back
his
head
and
blowing
the
smoke
sometimes
through
his
lips
and
sometimes
through
his
nose
he
looked
for
the
moment
older
than
his
years
and
a
difficult
young
customer
at
that
his
present
sulky
expression
disappeared
however
under
the
influence
of
tobacco
and
adventure
where
the
dickens
are
they
he
began
to
wonder
pulling
harder
a
bend
in
the
river
presently
solved
the
mystery
on
a
wide
stretch
of
which
the
tide
had
left
bare
in
going
out
but
was
now
beginning
to
cover
again
a
solitary
boat
was
stranded
with
this
clue
to
guide
him
carnaby
bright
eyes
soon
discovered
the
two
dim
forms
in
the
distance
ahoy
he
shouted
and
received
a
joyous
answer
robinette
and
mark
were
the
two
derelicts
and
their
rescuer
skimmed
towards
them
with
all
his
strength
he
could
get
only
within
a
few
yards
of
the
rock
to
which
their
boat
was
tied
and
from
that
distance
he
surveyed
them
expecting
to
find
a
dismal
pair
very
much
ashamed
of
themselves
and
getting
quite
weary
of
each
other
on
the
contrary
the
faces
he
could
just
distinguish
in
the
uncertain
light
were
radiant
and
voice
was
as
gay
as
ever
he
had
heard
it
he
leaned
upon
his
oars
and
looked
at
them
with
wonder
angel
cousin
cried
robinette
have
you
a
little
roast
mutton
about
you
somewhere
we
are
so
hungry
you
a
pretty
pair
he
remarked
what
have
you
been
and
done
we
just
went
for
a
row
after
tea
middy
dear
said
robinette
and
look
at
the
result
you
not
rowing
now
observed
carnaby
pointedly
no
said
mark
we
gave
up
rowing
when
the
water
left
us
carnaby
conversation
is
more
interesting
in
the
mud
but
how
did
you
get
here
i
thought
you
were
going
to
the
flag
rock
demanded
carnaby
is
there
a
flag
rock
middy
dear
i
did
know
said
robinette
innocently
it
shows
we
should
go
anywhere
without
our
first
cousin
once
removed
we
just
began
to
talk
here
in
the
boat
and
the
water
went
away
and
left
us
then
she
laughed
and
mark
laughed
too
and
carnaby
look
of
unutterable
scorn
seemed
to
have
no
effect
upon
them
they
might
almost
have
been
laughing
at
him
their
mirth
was
so
senseless
viewed
in
any
other
light
it
nearly
eight
he
said
solemnly
perhaps
you
can
form
some
idea
as
to
what
grandmother
saying
and
bates
well
you
going
to
be
our
rescuer
middy
darling
so
it
matter
said
robinette
look
the
water
coming
up
but
carnaby
seemed
in
no
mood
for
waiting
he
had
taken
off
his
boots
and
rolled
up
his
trousers
above
his
knees
i
let
lavendar
wade
ashore
the
best
way
he
could
he
said
but
i
i
got
to
save
you
or
there
be
a
howl
no
one
would
howl
any
louder
than
you
dear
and
you
know
it
step
in
shrieked
robinette
i
confided
a
shoe
already
to
the
i
just
put
my
foot
in
a
bit
to
test
it
and
down
the
poor
foot
went
and
came
up
without
its
shoe
oh
middy
dear
if
your
young
life
blow
my
young
life
retorted
carnaby
he
was
performing
gymnastics
on
the
edge
of
his
boat
letting
himself
down
and
heaving
himself
up
by
the
strength
of
his
arms
his
legs
were
covered
with
mud
no
go
he
said
it
as
deep
as
the
pit
here
sometimes
you
can
find
a
rock
or
a
hard
bit
we
must
just
wait
they
had
not
long
to
wait
after
all
for
presently
a
rush
of
the
tide
sent
the
water
swirling
round
the
stranded
boat
and
carried
craft
to
it
now
it
be
all
right
said
he
you
push
with
the
mark
and
i
pull
but
it
took
a
quarter
of
an
hour
pushing
and
pulling
to
get
the
boat
free
of
the
mud
except
for
the
moon
it
would
have
been
quite
dark
when
the
party
reached
the
pier
they
mounted
the
hill
in
some
silence
it
was
difficult
for
robinette
to
get
along
with
her
shoeless
foot
lavendar
wanted
to
help
her
but
she
demanded
carnaby
arm
he
was
sulking
still
there
was
something
he
felt
but
could
not
understand
in
the
subtle
atmosphere
of
happiness
by
which
the
truant
couple
seemed
to
be
surrounded
a
something
through
which
he
could
not
reach
that
seemed
to
put
robinette
at
a
distance
from
him
although
her
shoulder
touched
his
and
her
hand
was
on
his
arm
growing
pangs
of
his
manhood
assailed
him
the
male
jealousy
of
the
other
male
for
the
moment
he
hated
mark
mark
talking
joyous
nonsense
in
a
way
rather
unlike
himself
as
if
the
night
air
had
gone
to
his
head
i
am
glad
you
had
the
ferrets
to
amuse
you
this
afternoon
said
robinette
in
a
propitiatory
tone
ferrets
are
such
darlings
they
with
their
pink
eyes
o
assented
carnaby
derisively
one
of
the
darlings
bit
my
finger
to
the
bone
not
that
that
anything
to
you
oh
middy
dear
i
am
sorry
cried
robinette
i
kiss
the
place
to
make
it
well
if
we
were
in
such
a
hurry
carnaby
began
to
find
that
a
dignified
reserve
of
manner
was
very
difficult
to
keep
up
his
grandmother
could
manage
it
he
reflected
but
he
would
need
some
practice
when
they
came
to
a
place
where
there
were
sharp
stones
strewn
on
the
road
he
became
a
mere
boy
again
quite
suddenly
and
proposed
a
queen
chair
for
robinette
and
so
he
and
lavendar
crossed
hands
and
one
arm
of
robinette
encircled
the
head
while
the
other
just
touched
lavendar
neck
enough
to
be
steadied
by
it
their
laughter
frightened
the
sleepy
birds
that
night
the
demoralized
remnant
of
a
bank
holiday
party
would
have
been
lavendar
observed
respectability
itself
in
comparison
with
them
and
certainly
no
such
group
had
ever
approached
stoke
revel
before
they
were
to
enter
by
a
back
door
and
carnaby
was
to
introduce
them
to
the
housekeeper
room
where
he
undertook
that
bates
would
feed
them
lavendar
alone
was
to
be
ambassador
to
the
drawing
room
the
only
one
of
us
with
a
boot
on
each
foot
of
course
we
appoint
him
by
a
unanimous
vote
said
robinette
but
the
chief
thing
that
carnaby
remembered
after
all
of
that
evening
adventure
was
robinette
sudden
impulsive
kiss
as
she
bade
him
lavendar
standing
by
she
had
never
kissed
him
before
for
all
her
cousinliness
but
she
just
brushed
his
cool
round
cheek
as
if
with
a
puff
that
a
shabby
thing
to
call
a
kiss
said
the
embarrassed
but
exhilarated
youth
stop
growling
you
young
cub
and
be
grateful
half
a
loaf
is
better
than
no
bread
was
lavendar
comment
as
he
watched
the
draggled
and
muddy
but
still
charming
robinette
up
the
stairway
xiv
the
empty
shrine
lavendar
had
discovered
much
to
his
dismay
that
he
must
return
to
london
upon
important
business
it
was
even
a
matter
of
uncertainty
whether
his
father
could
spare
him
again
or
would
consent
to
his
returning
to
stoke
revel
to
conclude
de
tracy
arrangements
about
the
sale
of
the
land
affairs
of
the
heart
are
like
thunderstorms
the
atmosphere
may
sometimes
seem
charged
with
electricity
and
yet
circumstances
like
a
sudden
wind
that
sweeps
the
clouds
away
before
they
break
may
cause
the
lovers
to
drift
apart
or
all
in
a
moment
may
come
thunder
lightning
and
rain
from
a
clear
sky
and
there
is
nothing
that
is
apt
to
precipitate
matters
like
an
unexpected
parting
when
lavendar
announced
that
he
had
to
leave
stoke
revel
two
pairs
of
eyes
miss
smeardon
and
carnaby
instantly
looked
at
robinette
to
see
how
she
received
the
news
but
she
only
smiled
at
the
moment
she
was
just
beginning
her
breakfast
and
like
the
famous
charlotte
went
on
cutting
bread
and
butter
without
any
sign
of
emotion
hurrah
thought
the
boy
now
we
can
have
some
fun
and
i
perhaps
make
her
see
that
old
lavendar
is
the
only
companion
in
the
world
she
minds
thought
miss
smeardon
for
she
buttered
that
piece
of
bread
on
the
one
side
a
minute
ago
and
now
she
just
done
it
on
the
other
and
eaten
it
too
she
does
care
a
bit
thought
lavendar
she
not
even
changed
colour
my
going
or
staying
is
nothing
to
her
i
need
come
back
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
return
just
the
same
if
it
were
at
all
possible
and
he
told
de
tracy
so
she
remarked
graciously
that
he
was
a
welcome
guest
at
any
time
and
carnaby
hearing
this
pinched
lord
roberts
till
he
howled
like
a
fiend
and
fled
for
comfort
to
his
mistress
lap
you
little
coward
said
carnaby
you
should
be
ashamed
to
bear
the
name
of
a
hero
i
mentioned
to
you
before
carnaby
i
think
that
i
dislike
that
jest
said
his
grandmother
and
carnaby
advancing
to
the
injured
beast
said
yes
and
so
does
bobs
does
he
bobs
reducing
the
to
paroxysms
of
fury
would
it
be
any
better
if
i
called
him
hissing
the
word
into
the
animal
face
jealous
bobs
eh
this
last
word
had
a
rasping
sound
that
irritated
the
little
creature
more
than
ever
his
teeth
jibbered
with
anger
and
miss
smeardon
had
to
offer
him
a
saucer
of
cream
before
he
could
be
calmed
down
enough
for
the
rest
of
the
party
to
hear
themselves
speak
had
you
nice
letters
this
morning
mine
were
very
uninteresting
robinette
remarked
to
lavendar
as
they
stood
together
at
the
doorway
in
the
sunshine
while
carnaby
chased
the
round
and
round
the
lawn
i
had
only
two
letters
one
was
from
my
sister
amy
the
candid
one
her
letters
are
not
generally
exhilarating
oh
i
know
home
letters
are
usually
enough
to
send
one
straight
to
bed
with
a
headache
they
never
sound
a
note
of
hope
from
first
to
last
although
if
you
had
no
home
but
only
a
house
like
me
with
no
one
but
a
caretaker
in
it
you
be
very
thankful
to
get
them
doleful
or
not
i
doubt
it
mark
answered
for
amy
letter
seemed
to
be
burning
a
hole
in
his
pocket
at
that
moment
he
had
skimmed
it
hurriedly
through
but
parts
of
it
were
already
only
too
plain
when
the
others
had
gone
into
the
house
he
went
off
by
himself
and
jumping
the
low
fence
that
divided
the
lawn
from
the
fields
beyond
he
flung
himself
down
under
a
tree
to
read
it
over
again
carnaby
spying
him
there
came
rushing
from
the
house
and
was
soon
pouring
out
a
tale
of
something
that
had
happened
somewhere
and
throwing
stones
as
he
talked
at
the
birds
circling
about
the
ivied
tower
of
the
little
church
the
field
was
full
of
buttercups
up
to
the
very
churchyard
walls
i
must
get
away
by
myself
for
a
bit
lavendar
thought
that
chatter
will
drive
me
mad
at
this
point
carnaby
volatile
attention
was
diverted
by
the
sight
of
a
gardener
mounting
a
ladder
to
clear
the
sparrows
nests
from
the
water
chutes
and
he
jumped
up
in
a
twinkling
to
take
his
part
in
this
new
joy
lavendar
rose
and
strolled
off
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
bare
head
bent
the
grass
he
walked
in
was
a
very
field
of
the
cloth
of
gold
his
shoes
were
gilded
by
the
pollen
from
the
buttercups
his
eyes
dazzled
by
their
colour
it
was
a
relief
to
pass
through
the
stone
archway
that
led
into
the
little
churchyard
to
his
spirit
at
that
moment
the
chill
was
refreshing
he
loitered
about
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
seeing
that
the
door
was
open
he
entered
the
church
closing
the
door
gently
behind
him
it
was
very
quiet
in
there
and
even
the
chirping
of
the
sparrows
was
softened
into
a
faint
twitter
here
at
last
was
a
place
set
apart
a
moment
of
stillness
when
he
might
think
things
out
by
himself
he
took
out
amy
letter
smoothing
it
flat
on
the
prayer
books
before
him
and
forced
himself
to
read
it
through
the
early
paragraphs
dealt
with
some
small
item
of
family
news
which
in
his
present
state
of
mind
mattered
to
lavendar
no
more
than
the
distant
chirruping
of
the
birds
out
there
in
the
sunshine
you
seem
determined
to
stay
for
some
time
at
stoke
revel
his
sister
wrote
no
doubt
the
pretty
american
is
the
attraction
she
sounds
charming
from
your
description
but
my
dear
man
that
all
froth
how
many
times
have
i
heard
this
sort
of
thing
from
you
before
remember
i
know
everything
about
your
former
loves
you
then
said
lavendar
to
himself
down
down
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
of
the
heart
where
truth
lies
there
is
always
some
remembrance
generally
a
very
little
one
that
can
never
be
told
to
any
confidant
you
will
find
out
faults
in
loring
presently
just
like
the
rest
of
them
continued
the
pitiless
writer
amy
handwriting
was
painfully
distinct
i
must
tell
you
that
at
the
cowleys
the
other
day
i
suddenly
came
face
to
face
with
gertrude
meredith
dolly
looks
a
good
deal
older
already
and
fatter
i
thought
i
fear
she
is
losing
her
looks
for
her
colour
has
become
fixed
and
she
wear
no
collars
still
although
on
a
rather
thick
neck
not
at
all
becoming
i
spoke
to
her
for
about
three
minutes
as
it
was
less
awkward
when
we
met
suddenly
face
to
face
like
that
she
laughed
a
good
deal
and
asked
for
you
rather
audaciously
i
thought
they
live
near
winchester
now
and
since
the
colonel
death
are
pretty
badly
off
gertrude
says
dolly
is
going
to
devonshire
to
stay
with
the
cowleys
you
may
meet
her
there
any
day
remember
it
does
seem
incredible
to
me
that
a
man
of
your
discrimination
could
have
been
won
by
the
obvious
devotion
of
a
girl
like
dolly
but
having
given
your
word
i
almost
think
you
would
better
have
kept
it
rather
than
suffer
all
this
criticism
from
a
host
of
mutual
friends
lavendar
groaned
aloud
he
had
a
good
memory
and
with
all
too
great
distinctness
did
he
now
remember
dolly
meredith
laugh
how
wretched
it
had
all
been
not
a
word
had
ever
passed
between
them
that
had
any
value
now
if
he
could
have
washed
the
thought
of
her
forever
from
his
memory
how
greatly
he
would
have
rejoiced
at
that
moment
well
it
was
over
written
down
against
him
that
he
had
been
what
the
world
called
a
jilt
and
a
fool
yes
certainly
a
fool
but
not
so
great
a
one
as
to
follow
his
folly
to
its
ultimate
conclusion
and
tie
himself
for
life
to
a
woman
he
did
not
love
lavendar
was
extraordinarily
sensitive
about
the
breaking
of
his
engagement
partly
because
miss
meredith
herself
in
her
first
rage
had
avowed
his
responsibility
for
her
blighted
future
giving
him
no
chance
for
chivalrous
behaviour
partly
because
in
all
his
transient
love
affairs
he
had
easily
tired
of
the
women
who
inspired
them
he
seemed
thirsty
for
love
but
weary
of
it
almost
as
soon
as
the
draught
reached
his
lips
and
now
had
he
a
chance
again
or
was
it
all
to
end
in
disappointment
once
more
in
that
cold
disappointment
of
the
heart
that
has
received
stones
for
bread
it
was
not
entirely
his
own
fault
he
had
expected
much
from
life
and
hitherto
had
received
very
little
but
robinette
let
me
find
all
her
faults
now
he
said
to
himself
or
evermore
keep
silent
meantime
i
hope
i
am
not
concealing
too
many
of
my
own
he
tried
to
force
himself
into
criticism
to
look
at
her
as
a
cold
observer
from
the
outside
would
have
done
for
that
curious
border
country
of
love
which
he
had
entered
has
not
an
equable
climate
at
all
it
is
fire
and
frost
alternate
and
criticism
is
either
roused
almost
to
a
morbid
pitch
or
else
the
faculty
is
drugged
and
nothing
not
even
the
enumeration
of
a
hundred
foibles
will
awaken
it
for
a
time
when
the
cold
fit
had
been
upon
him
the
evening
before
lavendar
had
said
to
himself
that
her
manner
was
too
free
that
she
had
led
him
on
too
quickly
no
that
expression
was
dishonourable
and
unjust
he
repented
it
instantly
she
had
been
too
too
girlish
too
unthinking
in
what
she
said
and
did
but
she
a
widow
after
all
though
she
only
two
and
twenty
he
went
on
to
himself
hang
it
i
wish
she
were
not
if
her
heart
were
in
her
husband
grave
i
should
be
moaning
at
that
and
because
i
see
that
it
is
not
i
become
critical
there
nothing
quite
perfect
in
life
he
had
begun
by
noticing
some
little
defects
in
her
personal
appearance
but
he
was
long
past
that
now
what
did
such
trifles
matter
here
or
there
then
he
remembered
all
that
he
had
heard
said
about
american
women
did
those
pretty
clothes
of
hers
mean
that
she
would
be
extravagant
and
selfish
to
obtain
them
could
a
young
man
with
no
great
fortune
offer
her
the
luxury
that
was
necessary
to
her
and
even
so
what
changes
come
with
time
he
had
a
full
realization
of
what
the
boredom
of
family
life
can
be
when
passion
has
grown
stale
at
seventy
say
when
i
am
palsied
and
she
is
old
and
fat
will
romance
be
alive
then
will
such
feeling
leave
anything
real
behind
it
when
it
falls
away
as
the
white
blossoms
on
prettyman
plum
tree
will
shrink
and
fall
a
fortnight
hence
he
looked
about
him
on
the
walls
of
the
little
church
were
tablets
with
the
de
tracy
names
the
names
of
her
forefathers
amongst
them
under
his
feet
were
other
flags
with
names
upon
them
too
and
out
there
in
the
sunshine
were
the
of
a
hundred
dead
how
many
of
them
had
been
happy
in
their
loves
not
so
many
he
thought
if
all
were
told
and
why
should
he
hope
to
be
different
yet
surely
this
was
a
new
feeling
a
worthy
one
at
last
it
was
not
for
her
charming
person
that
he
loved
her
not
because
of
her
beauty
and
her
gaiety
only
but
because
he
had
seen
in
her
something
that
gave
a
promise
of
completion
to
his
own
nature
the
something
that
would
satisfy
not
only
his
senses
but
his
empty
heart
he
clenched
his
hands
on
the
carved
top
of
the
old
pew
in
front
of
him
which
was
fashioned
into
a
laughing
gnome
with
the
body
of
a
duck
and
if
this
should
be
all
a
dream
he
asked
himself
again
if
this
should
all
be
false
too
good
lord
he
cried
half
aloud
i
want
to
be
honest
now
i
want
to
find
the
truth
my
whole
life
is
on
the
throw
this
time
there
was
a
moment
silence
after
he
had
uttered
the
words
he
got
up
and
moved
slowly
down
the
aisle
opening
the
door
seeing
again
the
meadow
of
buttercups
yellow
as
gold
and
listening
again
to
the
sparrows
chirruping
in
the
sunshine
outside
i
have
been
in
that
church
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
said
to
himself
and
in
trying
to
dive
to
the
depths
of
myself
and
find
out
whether
i
was
giving
a
woman
all
i
had
to
give
i
did
not
get
time
to
consider
that
woman
probable
answer
should
i
place
my
uninteresting
life
and
liberty
at
her
disposal
xv
now
lubin
is
away
lavendar
made
his
adieux
after
luncheon
and
went
off
to
london
for
the
present
de
tracy
i
shall
be
back
on
wednesday
probably
if
i
can
arrange
it
he
said
loring
and
here
he
altered
the
phrase
to
shall
i
come
back
on
wednesday
for
his
hostess
had
left
the
open
door
there
was
no
hesitation
but
all
too
little
sentiment
about
robinette
reply
wednesday
at
the
latest
are
my
orders
she
answered
merrily
and
with
the
words
ringing
in
his
ears
lavendar
took
his
departure
do
you
remember
that
this
is
the
afternoon
of
the
garden
party
at
revelsmere
de
tracy
enquired
coming
into
the
drawing
room
a
few
minutes
later
where
loring
stood
by
the
open
window
she
had
allowed
herself
just
five
minutes
of
depression
staring
out
at
the
buttercup
meadow
how
black
the
rooks
looked
as
they
flew
about
it
and
how
dreary
everything
was
now
that
lavendar
had
gone
she
was
woman
enough
to
be
able
to
feel
inwardly
amused
at
her
own
absurdity
when
she
recognized
that
the
ensuing
three
days
seemed
to
stretch
out
into
a
limitless
expanse
of
dullness
the
village
seemed
asleep
or
dead
now
lubin
was
away
still
after
all
it
was
an
occasion
for
wearing
a
pretty
frock
and
she
knew
herself
well
enough
to
feel
sure
that
the
sight
of
a
few
of
her
even
pretending
to
enjoy
themselves
would
make
her
volatile
spirits
rise
like
the
mercury
in
a
thermometer
on
a
hot
day
miss
smeardon
was
to
be
her
companion
as
de
tracy
had
a
headache
that
afternoon
and
was
afraid
of
the
heat
she
said
what
heat
robinette
had
asked
innocently
for
in
spite
of
the
brilliant
sunlight
the
wind
blew
from
the
east
keen
as
a
knife
i
shall
take
a
good
wrap
in
the
carriage
in
spite
of
this
tropical
temperature
she
thought
carnaby
refused
point
blank
to
drive
with
them
he
would
bicycle
to
the
party
or
else
not
go
at
all
so
it
was
alone
with
miss
smeardon
that
robinette
started
in
the
heavy
old
landau
behind
the
palsied
horse
miss
smeardon
gave
one
glance
at
loring
dress
and
robinette
gave
one
glance
at
miss
smeardon
each
making
her
own
comments
that
white
cloth
will
go
to
the
cleaner
i
suppose
after
one
wearing
and
as
for
that
thing
on
her
head
with
lilac
wistaria
drooping
over
the
brim
it
ca
be
meant
as
a
covering
or
a
protection
either
from
sun
or
wind
it
nothing
but
an
ornament
miss
smeardon
commented
while
to
herself
robinette
ejaculated
a
penwiper
an
old
penwiper
is
all
that
miss
smeardon
resembles
in
that
black
rag
carnaby
watching
the
start
at
the
door
whistled
in
open
admiration
as
robinette
came
down
the
steps
well
well
we
are
got
up
to
kill
this
afternoon
pity
old
mark
has
just
gone
but
cheer
up
cousin
robin
there
always
a
curate
on
hand
for
once
robinette
ready
tongue
played
her
false
and
a
sense
of
loneliness
overcame
her
at
the
sound
of
lavendar
name
she
gathered
up
her
long
white
skirts
and
got
into
the
carriage
with
as
much
dignity
as
she
could
muster
while
carnaby
his
eyes
twinkling
with
mischief
stood
ready
to
shut
the
door
after
miss
smeardon
hope
you
enjoy
your
drive
he
jeered
you
need
to
hold
on
your
hats
bucephalus
goes
at
such
fiery
speed
that
they
be
torn
off
your
heads
unless
you
do
middy
dear
you
not
the
least
amusing
said
robinette
quite
crossly
and
with
a
lurch
the
carriage
moved
off
miss
smeardon
settled
herself
for
conversation
i
afraid
you
will
find
me
but
a
dull
companion
loring
she
said
glancing
sideways
at
robinette
from
under
the
brim
of
her
mushroom
hat
oh
you
will
be
able
to
tell
me
who
everyone
is
said
robinette
as
cheerfully
as
she
could
i
am
no
gossip
miss
smeardon
protested
it
is
necessary
to
gossip
is
it
but
i
a
wholesome
interest
in
my
fellow
creatures
and
it
is
well
to
know
about
people
a
little
when
one
comes
among
strangers
as
you
do
loring
one
ca
be
too
careful
an
american
particularly
miss
smeardon
voice
trailed
off
upon
a
note
of
insinuation
but
robinette
took
no
notice
of
the
remark
she
did
not
seem
to
have
anything
to
say
so
miss
smeardon
took
up
another
subject
what
a
pity
that
lavendar
had
to
leave
before
this
afternoon
he
would
have
been
such
an
addition
to
our
party
yes
would
he
robinette
agreed
though
she
carefully
kept
out
of
her
voice
the
real
passion
of
assent
that
was
in
her
heart
lavendar
is
so
agreeable
i
always
think
miss
smeardon
went
on
everyone
likes
him
he
almost
carries
his
pleasant
ways
too
far
i
suppose
that
was
how
she
paused
and
added
again
oh
but
as
i
said
i
never
talk
scandal
do
you
think
it
possible
to
be
too
pleasant
robinette
remarked
stupidly
enough
scarcely
caring
what
she
said
well
when
it
leads
a
poor
girl
to
imagine
that
she
is
loved
i
hear
that
dolly
meredith
is
just
the
engagement
kept
on
for
quite
a
year
i
believe
and
then
to
break
it
off
so
heartlessly
i
was
reminded
of
it
all
by
coming
here
miss
meredith
is
a
cousin
of
our
hostess
and
they
met
first
at
revelsmere
when
they
were
quite
young
there
is
always
a
certain
amount
of
talk
when
an
engagement
has
to
be
broken
off
said
robinette
in
a
cold
voice
they
seemed
quite
devoted
at
first
miss
smeardon
began
but
robinette
interrupted
her
the
sooner
such
things
are
forgotten
the
better
i
think
she
said
no
one
except
the
two
people
concerned
ever
knows
the
real
tell
me
miss
smeardon
whom
we
are
likely
to
meet
at
revelsmere
who
is
our
hostess
what
sort
of
parties
does
she
give
being
so
firmly
switched
off
from
the
affairs
of
lavendar
and
miss
meredith
it
was
impossible
for
miss
smeardon
to
talk
about
them
any
more
and
she
had
to
turn
to
a
less
congenial
theme
we
shall
meet
the
neighbours
she
told
robinette
but
i
am
afraid
they
may
not
interest
you
very
much
i
understand
that
in
america
you
are
accustomed
to
a
great
deal
of
the
society
of
gentlemen
here
there
are
so
few
and
all
of
them
are
married
all
laughed
robinette
well
there
is
finch
the
curate
but
he
is
a
celibate
and
young
tait
of
strewe
but
he
is
slightly
paralysed
why
carnaby
must
be
quite
an
eligible
bachelor
in
these
parts
said
robinette
but
miss
smeardon
was
so
deadly
literal
that
she
accepted
the
remark
as
a
serious
one
not
quite
yet
in
a
few
years
time
we
shall
need
to
be
very
careful
there
are
so
many
girls
here
but
not
all
of
them
desirable
of
course
there
are
what
a
dull
time
they
must
have
with
the
married
men
the
celibate
the
paralytic
and
carnaby
i
glad
my
girlhood
spent
in
devonshire
conversation
ended
here
for
the
carriage
rumbled
up
the
avenue
and
robinette
looked
about
her
eagerly
revelsmere
was
a
nice
old
house
surrounded
by
fine
sloping
lawns
and
a
background
of
sombre
beechwoods
the
lawns
were
dotted
with
groups
of
people
mainly
women
and
elderly
at
that
as
robinette
and
miss
smeardon
alighted
at
the
door
an
elderly
hostess
welcomed
them
and
an
elderly
host
led
them
across
the
lawn
and
straightly
they
fell
into
the
clutches
of
more
and
more
elderlies
it
is
fairly
bewildering
robinette
cried
in
her
heart
then
she
saw
a
bevy
of
girls
approaching
such
girls
happy
well
dressed
but
all
unattended
by
their
suitable
complement
of
young
men
for
whom
do
they
dress
here
they
a
deal
of
i
think
to
go
on
getting
themselves
up
so
nicely
for
themselves
and
the
celibate
the
paralytic
and
carnaby
thought
robinette
as
she
watched
them
presently
another
couple
came
across
the
lawn
the
young
woman
was
by
no
means
a
girl
rather
heavily
built
with
a
high
fixed
colour
she
was
attended
by
a
man
not
the
celibate
certainly
thought
loring
with
a
glance
at
his
figure
his
thick
neck
and
glossy
black
hair
nor
the
paralytic
and
it
not
carnaby
it
must
be
a
new
arrival
at
that
moment
it
began
to
rain
but
nothing
daunted
their
hostess
approached
her
and
saying
pleasantly
that
she
wished
to
introduce
her
to
miss
meredith
she
left
robinette
and
the
young
woman
standing
together
under
a
spreading
tree
and
took
the
gentleman
away
with
her
the
moment
that
she
heard
the
name
robinette
realized
who
miss
meredith
was
they
seated
themselves
side
by
side
on
a
garden
bench
and
miss
meredith
remarked
upon
the
heat
planting
a
rather
fat
hand
upon
the
arm
of
the
garden
seat
and
surveying
it
complacently
especially
the
very
bright
diamond
ring
upon
the
third
finger
after
a
few
preliminary
remarks
she
asked
loring
if
she
were
stopping
in
the
neighbourhood
yes
i
am
staying
at
stoke
revel
for
a
short
time
robinette
replied
de
tracy
is
my
aunt
or
at
least
i
am
admiral
de
tracy
niece
her
companion
did
not
seem
to
take
the
least
interest
in
this
part
of
the
information
only
when
stoke
revel
was
mentioned
she
looked
around
suddenly
as
if
surprised
they
talked
upon
indifferent
subjects
while
robinette
as
she
watched
miss
meredith
was
saying
a
good
deal
to
herself
although
she
only
spoke
aloud
about
the
weather
and
the
devonshire
scenery
i
will
be
just
if
i
ca
be
generous
she
thought
she
has
or
she
must
once
have
had
a
fine
complexion
i
dare
say
she
is
sincere
enough
she
may
be
sensible
she
might
be
when
pleased
there
is
going
to
be
a
shower
said
miss
meredith
but
i
nothing
on
to
spoil
she
added
glancing
at
robinette
hat
sitting
there
on
the
bench
hearing
the
spitting
rain
upon
the
water
below
them
and
watching
the
leaden
mists
that
slowly
gathered
over
the
landscape
robinette
fell
upon
a
moment
of
soul
sickness
very
unusual
to
her
miss
meredith
too
was
silent
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
if
she
had
looked
even
a
little
different
it
would
have
been
so
much
easier
to
explain
thought
robinette
then
suddenly
she
glanced
up
she
saw
that
her
companion
face
had
softened
and
changed
there
was
a
look
robinette
caught
it
just
for
one
moment
such
as
a
proud
angry
child
might
have
worn
sulky
hurt
to
the
heart
but
determined
not
to
cry
instantly
a
chord
was
struck
in
robinette
soul
she
has
suffered
anyway
she
thought
may
i
be
forgiven
for
my
harsh
judgment
with
a
shiver
she
drew
her
wrap
about
her
shoulders
and
miss
meredith
turned
towards
her
the
expression
robinette
had
noticed
passed
from
the
face
and
left
it
as
before
and
slightly
patronizing
you
seem
to
feel
cold
she
said
i
never
do
which
is
rather
unfortunate
as
i
just
going
out
to
india
indeed
how
soon
are
you
going
in
about
six
weeks
i
just
going
to
be
married
and
we
sail
directly
afterwards
said
miss
meredith
you
saw
joyce
i
think
when
we
came
up
together
a
few
minutes
ago
a
weight
as
if
of
a
ton
of
lead
was
lifted
from
robinette
heart
as
she
spoke
she
could
scarcely
refrain
from
jumping
up
to
throw
her
arms
about
dolly
meredith
neck
and
kiss
her
as
it
was
she
bubbled
over
with
a
kind
of
sympathetic
interest
that
astonished
the
other
woman
it
is
only
too
easy
to
lead
an
approaching
bride
to
talk
about
her
own
affairs
for
she
can
seldom
take
in
the
existence
of
even
her
nearest
and
dearest
at
such
a
time
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
two
young
women
were
deep
in
conversation
when
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
miss
smeardon
appeared
to
tell
robinette
that
they
must
be
going
she
looked
up
with
a
start
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
gravel
path
oh
you
are
here
loring
we
could
think
where
you
had
gone
said
miss
smeardon
acidly
and
here
is
miss
meredith
of
all
people
she
continued
i
thought
you
were
sure
to
be
on
the
tennis
court
miss
meredith
joyce
is
playing
now
oh
we
have
had
such
a
delightful
talk
said
dolly
so
flushed
with
pleasure
that
miss
smeardon
gazed
at
her
in
astonishment
if
only
i
knew
her
well
enough
to
send
her
a
munificent
wedding
present
how
i
should
love
to
do
so
just
to
register
my
own
joy
said
robinette
to
herself
as
it
was
she
shook
hands
very
warmly
with
miss
meredith
before
they
parted
and
when
half
way
across
the
lawn
looked
back
again
and
waved
her
hand
gaily
miss
meredith
was
pacing
the
grass
and
treading
heavily
beside
her
with
a
very
gallant
air
was
her
young
man
joyce
is
quite
wealthy
said
miss
smeardon
i
understand
that
he
is
an
only
son
too
and
will
some
day
inherit
a
fine
property
miss
meredith
is
most
fortunate
at
her
age
and
with
her
history
robinette
said
nothing
she
looked
out
at
the
glistening
reaches
of
the
river
now
shining
through
the
silver
mist
at
the
fields
yellow
with
buttercups
and
the
folds
of
the
distant
hills
as
they
drove
up
the
lane
to
the
house
the
birds
refreshed
by
the
rain
were
singing
like
angels
in
her
heart
too
something
was
singing
as
blithely
as
any
bird
amongst
them
all
sometimes
sometimes
our
mistakes
do
not
come
home
to
roost
she
thought
but
fly
away
and
make
nests
elsewhere
rich
nests
in
india
too
how
did
you
enjoy
the
party
cousin
robin
said
carnaby
who
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
doorway
i
had
a
good
of
strawberries
the
ladies
were
a
little
young
for
my
taste
just
immature
girls
no
one
under
sixty
and
rather
frisky
do
you
think
by
the
way
did
you
see
number
one
and
her
millionaire
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
number
one
said
robinette
haughtily
as
she
passed
in
at
the
door
you
will
when
you
number
two
rejoined
carnaby
stooping
to
pinch
lord
roberts
tail
till
the
hero
yelped
aloud
xvi
two
letters
lavendar
tore
up
his
fourth
sheet
of
paper
and
began
afresh
dear
mrs
loring
no
that
would
not
do
he
took
another
sheet
and
began
again
my
dear
loring
your
commission
for
old
prettyman
has
taken
some
little
time
to
execute
for
i
had
to
go
to
two
or
three
shops
before
finding
a
chair
green
cushions
and
a
wide
seat
so
comfortable
that
it
would
almost
act
as
an
anæsthetic
if
her
rheumatism
happened
to
be
bad
and
yet
quite
suitable
for
a
cottage
room
these
were
my
orders
i
think
and
like
all
your
orders
they
demand
something
better
than
the
mere
perfunctory
observance
my
own
proportions
differing
a
good
deal
from
those
of
the
old
lady
it
is
still
an
open
question
whether
what
seemed
comfortable
to
me
will
be
quite
the
same
to
her
i
can
but
hope
so
and
the
chair
will
be
dispatched
at
once
london
is
noisy
and
dusty
and
grimy
and
stuffy
and
to
one
man
at
least
very
very
dull
a
boat
on
greenshaw
ferry
seems
the
only
spot
in
the
world
where
any
gaiety
is
to
be
found
you
can
hear
the
cuckoos
calling
across
the
river
as
you
read
this
no
doubt
and
carnaby
is
rendered
happier
than
he
deserves
by
being
allowed
to
row
you
down
to
tell
prettyman
about
the
chair
i
feel
as
if
like
the
japanese
i
could
journey
a
hundred
miles
to
worship
that
wonderful
let
the
blossoms
fall
until
i
come
there
seems
a
good
deal
of
business
to
be
done
my
father
unfortunately
is
no
better
so
he
can
not
come
down
to
stoke
revel
and
i
shall
probably
return
upon
wednesday
morning
a
poem
of
browning
runs
in
my
head
something
about
three
days
i
ca
quote
exactly
if
my
sister
were
writing
this
letter
she
would
say
that
i
have
been
very
hard
to
please
and
uninterested
in
everything
since
i
came
home
indeed
it
seems
as
if
i
were
london
in
this
part
of
it
in
hot
weather
makes
a
man
weary
for
green
woods
a
sliding
river
and
a
book
of
verses
underneath
a
bough
well
perhaps
i
shall
have
all
of
them
by
wednesday
afternoon
you
will
think
i
can
do
nothing
but
grumble
all
the
same
into
what
was
the
mere
dull
routine
of
uncongenial
work
before
your
influence
has
come
with
a
current
of
new
energy
like
the
tide
from
the
sea
swelling
up
into
the
inland
i
at
it
again
rivers
on
the
brain
evidently
i
hope
meanwhile
that
carnaby
behaves
himself
and
is
not
too
much
of
a
bore
and
that
england
england
in
spring
at
least
is
gaining
a
corner
in
your
heart
your
mother
called
it
home
remember
yes
do
try
to
remember
that
did
you
go
to
the
garden
party
did
you
walk
did
you
drive
did
you
like
it
who
was
there
were
you
dull
there
was
a
postscript
i
have
found
the
verse
from
browning
i
shall
see
her
in
three
days
tuesday
dear
lavendar
first
many
thanks
for
nurse
armchair
which
arrived
in
perfect
order
and
is
a
shining
monument
to
your
good
taste
she
does
nothing
but
look
at
it
shrouding
it
when
she
retires
to
bed
with
an
old
to
protect
it
from
the
night
air
whether
she
will
ever
make
its
acquaintance
thoroughly
enough
to
sit
in
it
i
do
not
know
but
it
will
give
her
an
enormous
amount
of
pleasure
perhaps
her
glow
of
pride
in
its
possession
does
her
as
much
good
as
the
comfort
she
might
take
in
its
use
her
are
very
painful
just
now
and
i
have
a
good
deal
to
do
with
duckie
you
remember
duckie
i
call
her
mackenzie
after
that
lady
in
the
newcomes
who
talked
the
colonel
to
death
mackenzie
is
heavy
elderly
and
i
am
acquainted
with
every
bone
tendon
and
sinew
in
her
body
having
to
lift
her
into
a
coop
behind
the
cottage
where
she
will
not
wake
nurse
at
dawn
with
her
eternal
quacking
she
has
heretofore
slept
under
nurse
bedroom
window
and
dislikes
change
of
any
kind
so
lucky
she
has
no
offspring
i
tremble
to
think
of
what
maternal
example
might
do
in
such
a
talkative
family
stoke
revel
is
as
it
was
and
ever
will
be
world
without
end
only
aunt
de
tracy
is
crosser
than
when
you
are
here
and
life
is
not
as
gay
although
carnaby
does
his
dear
cubbish
best
if
ever
you
desire
your
mental
jewels
to
shine
at
their
brightest
if
ever
you
wish
a
tolerably
good
disposition
to
seem
like
that
of
an
angel
if
ever
in
a
fit
of
vanity
you
would
like
to
appear
as
a
blend
of
apollo
lancelot
demosthenes
prince
charlie
ajax
and
solomon
just
fly
to
stoke
revel
and
become
part
of
the
household
assume
nothing
simply
appear
and
the
surroundings
will
do
the
rest
like
the
arrangements
seen
upon
a
background
of
bates
william
benson
big
cummins
the
curate
miss
smeardon
and
may
i
dare
to
add
the
lady
of
the
manor
herself
any
living
breathing
man
takes
on
an
olympian
majesty
i
should
miss
you
in
boston
nor
in
london
perhaps
even
in
weston
i
might
find
a
wretched
substitute
but
here
you
are
priceless
i
have
some
news
for
you
on
saturday
miss
smeardon
and
i
went
to
a
garden
party
that
was
what
it
was
called
the
thermometer
was
only
slightly
below
zero
when
we
started
and
that
luminary
masquerading
as
the
sun
was
pretending
to
shine
soon
after
we
arrived
at
the
festive
scene
there
were
gusts
of
wind
and
rain
i
sought
the
shelter
of
a
spreading
tree
the
kitchen
fire
not
being
available
and
i
was
joined
there
by
the
hostess
who
presented
her
niece
your
miss
meredith
dear
lavendar
this
is
a
subject
we
can
not
write
about
you
and
i
am
loyal
to
my
sex
and
what
miss
meredith
said
and
looked
and
did
are
all
as
sacred
to
me
as
they
ought
to
be
i
only
want
to
tell
you
that
she
is
happy
that
she
has
this
very
week
become
engaged
and
is
going
to
india
with
her
husband
in
a
month
now
that
little
cankerworm
that
has
been
gnawing
at
your
roots
of
life
for
the
last
year
or
two
has
done
its
worst
and
you
are
perfectly
free
to
go
and
make
other
mistakes
i
only
hope
you
get
free
from
those
too
for
i
do
like
to
see
nice
men
burn
their
fingers
we
became
such
good
friends
huddled
up
in
that
boat
when
we
were
stuck
in
the
mud
ugh
i
can
smell
it
now
that
i
am
glad
to
be
the
first
to
send
you
pleasant
news
sincerely
yours
robinetta
loring
xvii
de
tracy
crosses
the
ferry
lavendar
blunt
refusal
except
under
certain
conditions
to
announce
to
prettyman
her
coming
ejection
from
the
cottage
at
wittisham
was
unprofessional
enough
as
he
himself
felt
but
it
was
final
and
categorical
conveying
as
it
did
a
sort
of
tacit
remonstrance
this
refusal
had
an
unfortunate
effect
for
it
only
served
to
rouse
de
tracy
formidable
obstinacy
she
had
seized
upon
one
point
only
in
their
numberless
and
wearisome
discussions
of
the
matter
prettyman
had
no
legal
claim
upon
stoke
revel
to
give
her
compensation
for
the
plum
tree
would
be
to
allow
that
she
had
to
create
a
precedent
highly
dangerous
under
the
circumstances
how
could
one
refuse
to
other
old
women
or
old
men
leaving
their
cottages
what
one
had
weakly
granted
to
her
the
demands
would
be
unceasing
the
trouble
endless
so
arguing
de
tracy
soon
brought
herself
to
a
state
of
determination
bordering
on
a
sort
of
mania
she
was
old
and
in
exaggerated
harshness
her
life
was
retreating
as
it
were
into
its
last
stronghold
at
bay
as
good
as
her
word
for
she
had
vowed
she
would
warn
prettyman
herself
and
she
was
never
one
to
procrastinate
the
lady
of
the
manor
proceeded
to
plan
her
visit
to
wittisham
she
had
not
crossed
the
river
for
years
wittisham
one
of
the
loveliest
villages
in
england
perhaps
though
little
known
was
a
thorn
in
her
side
as
it
would
have
been
in
that
of
any
other
landlord
with
empty
pockets
what
you
could
not
deal
with
to
your
own
advantage
it
was
better
to
ignore
and
on
this
autocratic
principle
de
tracy
had
left
wittisham
to
itself
but
now
the
boat
carried
her
there
alone
and
fierce
as
the
scotch
say
bent
upon
a
course
of
conduct
that
she
knew
would
hold
her
up
to
the
hatred
of
every
person
of
her
acquaintance
and
bitterly
triumphant
in
the
knowledge
the
meanness
of
her
errand
never
struck
her
on
the
contrary
she
would
have
argued
it
was
one
well
worthy
of
her
a
part
of
the
scheme
in
the
consummation
of
which
she
had
spent
her
married
life
and
her
whole
indomitable
energy
losing
actually
her
own
identity
in
the
process
and
becoming
an
inexorable
machine
that
scheme
was
the
holding
together
of
stoke
revel
for
the
de
tracys
the
maintenance
of
family
dignity
and
power
the
of
a
race
that
had
always
ruled
the
river
beneath
her
carrying
her
to
the
fulfilment
of
her
duty
the
noble
river
widening
to
the
sea
subject
to
its
tides
and
made
turbulent
by
its
storms
typified
to
de
tracy
only
the
greatness
of
stoke
revel
from
its
banks
the
de
tracys
had
sent
out
generation
after
generation
men
who
had
commanded
fleets
who
had
upheld
the
national
honour
upon
the
farthest
seas
very
often
at
the
cost
of
life
there
was
no
sacrifice
of
herself
at
which
de
tracy
would
have
hesitated
in
upholding
this
ideal
no
sacrifice
of
others
either
what
was
lizzie
prettyman
in
comparison
a
bag
of
old
bones
fit
for
nothing
but
the
workhouse
a
little
faster
william
said
the
widow
sitting
upright
in
the
stern
and
william
the
footman
bent
to
his
oars
the
beads
of
perspiration
standing
on
his
brow
when
de
tracy
stepped
out
upon
the
pier
she
had
to
be
reminded
where
the
prettyman
cottage
was
you
know
it
by
the
plum
tree
said
william
respectfully
everybody
does
it
was
not
far
off
on
the
river
side
the
tide
had
ebbed
and
left
a
stretch
of
muddy
foreshore
in
front
of
it
where
the
rotting
poles
for
hanging
the
fishing
nets
out
to
dry
stood
gauntly
up
de
tracy
approached
the
steps
which
merged
into
the
flagged
path
before
the
door
and
paused
to
survey
the
property
she
intended
to
part
with
she
had
no
eye
for
the
picturesque
a
few
white
petals
from
the
blossoming
plum
tree
scattered
by
the
breeze
fell
upon
her
black
bonnet
and
shoulders
a
faint
scent
of
honey
came
from
it
and
the
hum
of
bees
for
the
day
was
warm
the
condition
of
the
cottage
engaged
de
tracy
attention
and
for
this
she
thought
scornfully
a
man
will
give
hundreds
of
pounds
there
truth
in
the
adage
that
a
fool
and
his
money
are
soon
parted
she
mounted
the
steps
that
led
up
to
the
patch
of
garden
her
keen
cold
eyes
everywhere
at
once
a
cat
ca
sneeze
without
she
her
villagers
at
stoke
revel
were
wont
to
say
disappearing
into
their
houses
as
rabbits
into
their
burrows
at
sight
of
a
terrier
old
elizabeth
prettyman
stood
at
her
door
and
it
took
some
time
to
make
her
realize
who
her
august
visitor
was
she
was
getting
blind
she
had
never
been
a
favourite
with
de
tracy
nor
had
she
entered
stoke
revel
manor
since
her
nursling
disgraced
it
by
marrying
a
bean
she
curtseyed
humbly
to
the
great
lady
there
now
she
said
it
not
often
we
have
seen
you
across
the
river
will
you
please
to
come
inside
and
sit
down
is
very
warm
this
afternoon
it
is
she
was
a
good
deal
fluttered
in
her
welcome
for
there
was
that
in
de
tracy
air
that
seemed
to
bode
misfortune
i
shall
sit
down
for
a
few
minutes
elizabeth
was
the
reply
while
i
explain
my
visit
to
you
prettyman
stood
aside
respectfully
and
de
tracy
swept
past
her
into
the
cottage
and
seated
herself
there
it
never
occurred
to
her
to
ask
the
old
woman
to
sit
down
in
her
own
house
she
expected
her
to
stand
throughout
the
interview
without
further
preamble
then
de
tracy
came
to
the
point
elizabeth
she
said
i
have
come
to
tell
you
that
i
am
going
to
sell
the
land
on
which
this
cottage
stands
and
that
you
will
have
to
find
some
other
home
the
old
woman
did
not
understand
for
a
minute
you
be
going
to
sell
the
land
she
repeated
stupidly
yes
i
am
a
gentleman
from
london
wishes
to
buy
it
you
will
need
to
go
a
gentleman
from
london
lor
no
gentleman
from
london
would
live
elizabeth
cried
perfectly
dazed
by
the
statement
de
tracy
repeated
it
is
not
your
business
elizabeth
what
he
intends
to
do
with
the
place
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
remove
from
the
house
the
old
woman
sank
down
on
the
nearest
chair
and
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
she
was
so
old
and
so
tired
that
she
had
no
heart
to
face
life
under
new
conditions
even
should
they
be
better
than
those
she
left
a
younger
woman
would
have
snapped
her
fingers
in
de
tracy
face
so
to
speak
and
wished
her
joy
of
her
old
rattletrap
of
a
house
but
elizabeth
prettyman
after
a
lifetime
of
struggles
had
not
vitality
enough
for
such
an
action
she
had
never
dreamed
of
leaving
the
cottage
and
where
was
she
to
go
her
furrowed
face
wore
an
expression
of
absolute
terror
now
when
she
looked
up
but
where
be
i
to
live
she
cried
i
do
not
know
elizabeth
you
must
arrange
that
with
your
relations
said
de
tracy
i
do
but
only
me
niece
as
married
down
exeter
way
well
you
should
write
to
her
then
she
do
want
to
keep
me
nettie
do
she
but
a
poor
wife
and
five
chillen
she
it
not
like
as
if
she
were
me
daughter
you
have
some
small
sum
of
money
of
your
own
every
year
have
you
not
de
tracy
asked
ten
pound
a
year
the
same
that
me
left
me
two
pounds
saved
and
is
in
an
annuity
that
all
i
that
and
me
plum
tree
the
plum
tree
is
not
yours
either
elizabeth
that
belongs
to
the
land
said
de
tracy
curtly
was
me
planted
it
years
ago
we
watched
and
pruned
and
tended
like
a
child
we
did
an
now
to
be
told
ai
mine
you
forgetting
yourself
elizabeth
i
think
said
de
tracy
it
was
simply
impossible
for
her
to
see
with
the
old
woman
eyes
all
she
remembered
was
the
legal
fact
that
any
tree
planted
in
stoke
revel
ground
belonged
to
the
owner
of
the
ground
but
is
a
big
part
of
me
living
is
the
plum
tree
only
yesterday
i
says
to
the
young
lady
miss
cynthia
young
lady
i
says
knows
how
would
be
with
me
without
i
had
the
plum
tree
i
can
not
help
that
elizabeth
the
plum
tree
is
not
yours
it
belongs
to
stoke
revel
then
you
be
me
something
for
it
surely
no
said
de
tracy
obstinately
you
have
no
legal
claim
to
compensation
elizabeth
i
can
not
undertake
to
allow
you
anything
for
what
is
not
yours
if
i
did
it
in
your
case
you
know
quite
well
i
should
have
to
do
it
in
many
others
there
was
a
long
and
heavy
silence
elizabeth
prettyman
was
taking
in
her
sentence
of
banishment
from
her
old
home
de
tracy
was
merely
wondering
how
long
it
would
take
her
to
walk
down
that
nasty
steep
bit
of
path
to
the
ferry
at
last
the
old
woman
looked
up
when
must
i
be
goin
then
she
asked
meekly
de
tracy
considered
the
transfer
of
land
from
one
person
to
another
generally
takes
some
time
you
will
have
several
weeks
here
still
i
shall
send
you
notice
later
which
day
to
quit
thank
you
said
elizabeth
simply
and
added
the
plum
tree
blossoms
be
over
by
that
time
i
do
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
it
said
de
tracy
in
whose
heart
there
was
room
for
no
sentiment
would
have
been
leavin
it
in
blossom
time
the
old
woman
explained
but
her
hearer
could
not
see
the
point
she
rose
slowly
from
her
chair
and
looked
around
the
cottage
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
keep
your
place
clean
and
respectable
elizabeth
she
said
i
wish
you
good
afternoon
elizabeth
never
rose
from
her
chair
to
see
her
visitor
to
the
door
an
omission
which
de
tracy
was
not
likely
to
overlook
she
just
sat
there
gazing
stupidly
around
the
tiny
kitchen
and
muttering
a
word
or
two
now
and
then
at
last
she
got
up
and
tottered
to
the
garden
i
to
leave
it
all
leave
the
old
bench
as
me
william
did
put
for
me
with
his
own
and
leave
duckie
duckie
ca
never
go
to
exeter
if
i
goes
there
and
leave
the
plum
tree
she
limped
across
the
little
bit
of
sunny
turf
and
stood
under
the
white
canopy
of
the
blossoming
tree
leaning
against
its
slender
trunk
pity
is
we
ai
rooted
in
the
ground
same
as
the
trees
are
she
mused
then
no
one
could
turn
us
out
only
the
lord
almighty
cut
us
down
when
our
time
came
lord
knows
i
about
ready
for
that
now
as
you
may
say
she
leaned
her
poor
weary
old
head
against
the
tree
stem
and
wept
ready
ah
how
ready
at
that
moment
to
lay
down
the
burden
of
her
long
and
toilsome
life
good
afternoon
nursie
dear
a
clear
voice
called
out
in
her
ear
and
elizabeth
started
to
find
that
robinette
had
across
the
grass
and
was
standing
close
beside
her
she
lifted
her
face
up
to
robinette
as
a
child
might
have
done
i
to
quit
missie
she
sobbed
to
leave
me
and
duckie
and
the
plum
tree
an
i
no
place
to
go
to
and
naught
but
my
ten
pounds
to
live
on
and
wo
keep
me
without
i
the
plum
tree
not
when
i
rent
to
pay
from
it
not
if
i
do
eat
nothing
but
tea
an
bread
never
again
in
a
moment
robinette
arms
were
about
her
her
soft
young
cheeks
pressed
against
the
withered
old
face
what
this
you
saying
nurse
she
cried
leaving
your
cottage
who
said
so
it
true
dear
quite
true
the
lady
been
here
to
tell
me
so
was
that
what
aunt
de
tracy
was
here
about
i
met
her
on
the
road
five
minutes
ago
she
said
she
had
been
here
on
business
but
tell
me
nurse
why
does
she
want
you
to
leave
are
you
going
to
get
a
better
cottage
does
she
think
this
one
is
healthy
for
you
no
no
dear
is
that
she
sold
the
cottage
over
me
that
what
is
or
she
going
to
sell
it
to
a
gentleman
from
london
lord
knows
what
a
gentleman
from
london
wants
wi
and
i
to
quit
robinette
tried
to
be
a
peacemaker
then
you
get
a
much
more
comfortable
house
that
quite
certain
you
know
though
this
one
is
lovely
on
fine
days
like
this
that
the
thatch
is
all
coming
off
and
i
sure
it
damp
inside
just
wait
a
bit
and
see
if
you
do
get
some
nice
cosy
little
place
with
a
sound
roof
and
quite
dry
that
will
cure
this
rheumatism
of
yours
but
prettyman
shook
her
head
no
no
there
wo
be
no
cosy
place
given
to
me
i
no
more
worth
than
an
old
shoe
now
missie
and
i
to
be
turned
out
the
lady
said
so
said
as
i
must
go
to
exeter
to
live
with
me
niece
nettie
and
do
want
us
nettie
do
and
whatever
shall
i
do
without
i
duckie
and
the
plum
tree
oh
but
robinette
began
quite
incredulously
and
the
old
woman
took
up
her
lament
again
and
i
asked
the
lady
would
i
something
allowed
me
for
the
plum
tree
that
about
clothed
me
for
years
back
and
she
says
ai
your
plum
tree
elizabeth
is
mine
i
ca
nothing
on
me
own
plum
tree
robinette
still
refused
to
believe
the
story
nurse
dear
she
said
you
a
tiny
bit
deaf
now
you
know
and
perhaps
you
misunderstood
about
leaving
suppose
you
keep
your
dear
old
heart
easy
for
and
i
come
down
bright
and
early
and
tell
you
what
it
really
is
if
you
have
to
leave
the
plum
tree
you
get
a
fine
price
put
on
it
that
may
last
you
for
years
it
such
a
splendid
tree
anyone
can
see
it
worth
a
good
deal
that
it
be
missie
the
finest
tree
in
wittisham
the
old
woman
said
drying
her
eyes
a
little
comforted
by
the
assurance
in
robinette
voice
and
manner
there
now
we
wo
have
any
more
tears
i
brought
a
new
canister
of
tea
i
sent
for
to
london
i
just
dying
to
taste
if
it
good
we
brew
it
together
nursie
i
shall
carry
out
the
little
table
from
the
kitchen
and
we
drink
our
tea
under
the
plum
tree
robinette
cried
she
was
carrying
a
great
parcel
under
her
arm
and
when
prettyman
opened
it
she
could
scarcely
believe
that
this
lovely
red
tin
canister
filled
with
pounds
of
fragrant
tea
could
really
be
hers
the
sight
of
such
riches
almost
drove
away
her
former
fears
robinette
whisked
into
the
kitchen
and
came
out
carrying
the
little
round
table
which
she
set
down
under
the
white
canopy
of
the
plum
tree
then
together
they
brought
out
the
rest
of
the
tea
things
and
what
a
merry
meal
they
had
it
just
nonsense
and
a
bit
of
deafness
on
your
part
nurse
so
we
wo
remember
anything
about
leaving
the
house
we
are
only
going
to
think
of
enjoyment
robinette
announced
then
the
old
woman
was
comforted
as
old
people
are
wont
to
be
by
the
brave
assurances
of
those
younger
and
stronger
than
themselves
forgot
the
spectre
that
seemed
to
have
risen
suddenly
across
her
path
and
laughed
and
talked
as
she
sipped
the
fragrant
london
tea
xviii
the
stoke
revel
jewels
hullo
cousin
robin
hurry
up
you
need
all
your
time
it
was
carnaby
of
course
who
saluted
robinette
thus
as
she
came
towards
the
house
on
her
return
from
wittisham
i
not
late
am
i
she
said
consulting
her
watch
i
thought
you
be
making
a
tremendous
toilette
one
of
your
killing
ones
carnaby
said
do
i
love
to
see
you
all
dressed
up
till
old
smeardon
eyes
look
as
if
they
would
drop
out
when
you
come
into
the
room
i
wear
my
black
dress
and
her
eyes
may
remain
in
her
head
robinette
laughed
and
what
about
mark
eyes
would
you
like
them
to
drop
out
the
boy
asked
mischievously
he
come
back
by
the
afternoon
train
while
you
were
away
at
wittisham
oh
has
he
robinette
said
and
carnaby
stared
so
hard
at
her
that
to
her
intense
annoyance
she
blushed
hotly
horrid
boy
she
said
to
herself
as
she
ran
upstairs
growing
up
far
too
quickly
he
needs
to
be
snubbed
she
dashed
to
the
wardrobe
pulled
out
the
black
garment
and
gave
it
a
vindictive
shake
old
dowdy
unbecoming
thing
she
cried
then
her
eye
lighted
on
a
cherished
lavender
satin
she
stood
for
a
moment
deliberating
the
black
dress
over
her
arm
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
lavender
one
that
hung
in
the
wardrobe
i
do
care
she
cried
suddenly
i
wear
the
lavender
so
here
goes
men
are
all
colour
blind
so
he
merely
notice
that
i
look
nice
i
must
conceal
from
myself
and
everybody
else
how
depressed
i
am
over
the
interview
with
nurse
and
how
i
dread
discussing
the
cottage
with
aunt
de
tracy
that
must
be
done
the
first
thing
after
dinner
or
i
shall
lose
what
little
courage
i
have
lavendar
thought
he
had
never
seen
her
look
so
lovely
as
when
he
met
her
in
the
drawing
room
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
about
the
dress
but
its
exquisite
tint
and
the
sheen
of
the
soft
satin
the
suggestion
that
lay
in
the
colour
was
entirely
lost
upon
him
however
if
asked
to
name
it
he
would
doubtless
have
said
purplish
how
he
wished
that
he
might
have
escorted
her
into
the
dining
room
but
de
tracy
was
his
portion
as
usual
and
robinette
was
waiting
for
carnaby
who
seemed
unaccountably
slow
your
arm
middy
when
you
are
quite
ready
she
said
to
him
at
last
carnaby
extraordinary
unreadiness
seemed
to
arise
from
his
trying
to
smuggle
some
object
up
his
sleeve
this
proved
a
few
moments
later
to
be
a
bundle
of
lavender
sticks
tied
with
violet
ribbon
that
he
had
discovered
in
his
bureau
drawer
he
laid
it
by
robinette
plate
with
a
whispered
my
compliments
what
does
your
cousin
want
that
bunch
of
lavender
for
at
the
table
de
tracy
enquired
she
likes
lavender
anywhere
carnaby
said
with
a
wink
on
the
side
not
visible
by
his
grandmother
it
a
favourite
of
hers
robinette
could
only
be
thankful
that
lavendar
was
occupied
in
a
discussion
of
wine
with
bates
and
she
was
able
to
conceal
the
bundle
of
herbs
before
his
eyes
met
hers
for
the
fury
she
felt
against
her
precious
young
kinsman
at
that
moment
she
could
have
expressed
only
by
blows
dinner
seemed
interminably
long
robinette
for
more
reasons
than
one
was
preoccupied
lavendar
made
few
remarks
and
carnaby
was
possessed
by
a
spirit
of
perfectly
fiendish
mischief
saying
and
doing
everything
that
could
most
exasperate
his
grandmother
put
her
guests
to
the
blush
and
shock
miss
smeardon
but
at
last
de
tracy
rose
from
the
table
and
the
ladies
followed
her
from
the
room
leaving
lavendar
to
cope
alone
with
carnaby
my
fair
american
cousin
is
more
than
usually
lovely
eh
mr
lavendar
the
boy
said
with
his
laughable
assumption
of
a
man
of
the
world
there
my
young
friend
that
will
do
you
talking
altogether
too
much
said
lavendar
as
he
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
wine
and
sat
down
by
the
open
window
to
drink
it
carnaby
perhaps
not
unreasonably
offended
lounged
out
of
the
room
and
left
the
older
man
to
his
own
meditations
robinette
in
the
meantime
went
into
the
drawing
room
with
her
aunt
and
they
sat
down
together
in
the
dim
light
while
miss
smeardon
went
upstairs
to
write
a
letter
aunt
de
tracy
robinette
began
i
was
calling
on
prettyman
just
after
you
had
been
with
her
this
afternoon
and
do
you
know
the
dear
old
soul
had
taken
the
strangest
idea
into
her
head
she
says
you
are
going
to
ask
her
to
leave
the
cottage
the
land
on
which
her
cottage
stands
is
about
to
be
sold
said
de
tracy
it
is
necessary
that
she
should
move
yes
she
quite
understood
that
but
she
thinks
she
is
not
going
to
get
another
house
that
was
what
was
distressing
her
naturally
of
course
she
hates
to
leave
the
old
place
but
i
believe
if
she
gets
another
nicer
cottage
that
will
quite
console
her
said
robinette
quickly
i
have
no
vacant
cottage
on
the
estate
just
now
said
de
tracy
quietly
then
what
is
she
to
do
is
it
impossible
that
she
should
move
until
another
place
is
made
ready
for
her
robinette
rose
and
stood
beside
the
table
leaning
the
tips
of
her
fingers
on
it
in
an
attitude
of
intense
earnestness
she
was
trying
to
conceal
the
anger
and
dismay
she
felt
at
her
aunt
reply
prettyman
has
relatives
at
exeter
said
de
tracy
without
the
quiver
of
an
eyelid
yes
but
they
are
poor
they
are
very
near
relations
and
they
do
want
her
o
aunt
de
tracy
is
it
necessary
to
make
her
leave
she
depends
upon
the
plum
tree
so
she
makes
dollars
a
year
from
the
jam
dollars
have
no
significance
for
me
said
de
tracy
with
an
icy
smile
well
pounds
then
five
pounds
she
makes
how
is
she
ever
going
to
live
without
that
unless
you
give
her
the
equivalent
it
half
her
livelihood
i
promised
you
would
consider
it
was
i
wrong
old
bitternesses
rose
in
de
tracy
heart
the
prejudices
and
the
grudges
of
a
lifetime
everything
connected
with
robinette
mother
had
been
wrong
in
her
eyes
and
now
everything
connected
with
robinette
was
wrong
too
and
becoming
more
so
with
startling
rapidity
you
had
no
right
whatsoever
to
make
any
promises
on
my
behalf
she
now
said
harshly
you
have
acted
foolishly
and
officiously
this
is
no
business
of
yours
i
gladly
make
it
my
business
if
you
let
me
aunt
de
tracy
pleaded
robinette
if
you
do
feel
inclined
to
provide
for
prettyman
may
i
she
is
my
mother
old
nurse
and
she
sha
want
for
anything
as
long
as
i
have
a
penny
to
call
my
own
eyes
filled
with
tears
but
de
tracy
was
not
a
whit
moved
by
this
show
of
emotion
which
appeared
to
her
unnecessary
and
theatrical
you
are
forgetting
yourself
a
good
deal
in
your
way
of
speaking
to
me
on
this
subject
she
said
coldly
when
i
behaved
unbecomingly
in
my
youth
my
mother
always
recommended
me
to
go
upstairs
shut
myself
up
alone
in
my
room
and
collect
my
thoughts
the
process
had
invariably
a
calming
effect
i
advise
you
to
try
it
robinette
did
not
need
to
be
proffered
the
hint
twice
she
rushed
out
of
the
room
like
a
whirlwind
not
looking
where
she
went
in
the
hall
she
came
face
to
face
with
lavendar
who
had
just
left
the
dining
room
mr
lavendar
she
cried
do
go
into
the
drawing
room
and
speak
to
my
aunt
preach
to
her
argue
with
her
convince
her
that
she
and
must
act
in
this
way
ca
go
and
turn
prettyman
out
and
rob
her
of
the
plum
tree
and
leave
her
with
hardly
a
penny
in
the
world
or
a
roof
over
her
head
it
not
a
very
pretty
or
a
very
pleasant
business
loring
i
admit
said
lavendar
quietly
is
it
english
law
cried
robinette
with
indignation
if
it
is
i
call
it
mean
and
unjust
sometimes
the
laws
seem
very
hard
said
lavendar
i
like
to
discuss
this
affair
with
you
quietly
another
time
as
he
spoke
carnaby
appeared
and
wanted
to
be
told
what
the
matter
was
but
robinette
discovered
that
it
is
not
very
easy
to
criticise
a
grandmother
to
her
youthful
grandson
more
especially
when
the
lady
in
question
is
your
hostess
aunt
de
tracy
and
i
have
had
a
little
difference
of
opinion
about
prettyman
and
her
cottage
and
the
plum
tree
she
said
to
the
boy
quietly
and
lavendar
nodded
approval
prettyman
got
the
sack
has
she
carnaby
enquired
with
a
carelessness
robinette
looked
very
grave
my
dear
old
nurse
is
to
leave
her
cottage
she
said
with
a
quiver
in
her
voice
she
to
lose
her
plum
tree
but
of
course
she
get
compensation
cried
carnaby
no
middy
she
to
get
no
compensation
said
robinette
in
a
low
voice
well
i
call
that
jolly
hard
it
a
beastly
shame
said
carnaby
evidently
pricking
up
his
ears
and
with
a
sudden
frown
that
changed
his
face
i
say
mark
but
lavendar
did
not
think
the
moment
suitable
for
a
discussion
of
prettyman
wrongs
besides
he
did
not
wish
robinette
to
be
banished
from
the
drawing
room
for
a
whole
interminable
evening
he
contrived
to
silence
carnaby
for
the
time
being
let
bury
the
hatchet
for
a
little
while
he
suggested
have
you
forgotten
loring
that
i
made
de
tracy
promise
to
show
off
the
stoke
revel
jewels
for
your
benefit
this
very
night
o
but
now
i
in
disgrace
she
wo
said
robinette
yes
she
will
said
carnaby
nothing
puts
the
old
lady
in
such
a
heavenly
temper
as
showing
off
the
jewels
do
you
miss
it
cousin
robin
it
like
the
tower
of
london
and
madam
tussaud
rolled
into
one
this
show
i
can
assure
you
come
on
come
back
into
the
drawing
room
need
be
afraid
when
mark
there
robinette
found
that
a
black
look
or
two
was
all
that
she
had
to
fear
from
de
tracy
at
present
and
even
these
became
less
severe
under
the
alchemy
of
lavendar
tact
a
reminder
that
an
exhibition
of
the
jewelry
had
been
promised
was
graciously
received
bates
and
benson
were
summoned
and
armed
with
innumerable
keys
they
descended
to
subterranean
regions
where
safes
were
unlocked
and
solemnly
brought
into
the
drawing
room
de
tracy
wore
an
air
almost
devotional
as
she
unlocked
the
final
receptacles
with
keys
never
allowed
to
leave
her
own
hands
if
the
proceedings
had
begun
with
prayer
and
ended
with
a
hymn
it
would
have
surprised
me
in
the
least
robinette
said
to
herself
looking
silently
on
her
silence
luckily
for
her
was
taken
for
the
speechlessness
of
awe
and
did
a
good
deal
to
make
up
in
the
eyes
of
her
august
relative
for
her
late
indiscretions
as
a
matter
of
fact
her
irreverent
thoughts
were
mostly
to
the
effect
that
all
but
the
historical
pieces
of
the
stoke
revel
would
be
the
better
of
by
tiffany
or
cartier
de
tracy
opened
an
old
shagreen
case
and
the
firelight
flickered
on
the
diamonds
of
a
small
tiara
this
is
a
part
of
the
famous
montmorency
set
she
announced
proudly
with
the
tone
of
a
keeper
of
regalia
then
she
took
out
a
rope
of
pearls
ending
in
tassels
these
belonged
to
marie
antoinette
she
said
an
emerald
set
was
next
produced
and
the
emeralds
it
was
explained
had
once
adorned
a
crown
deep
green
they
were
encrusted
in
their
diamond
setting
costly
unique
but
they
left
robinette
cold
though
like
most
american
women
she
loved
precious
stones
as
an
adornment
one
of
those
emeralds
she
was
thinking
was
worth
fifty
times
more
than
old
lizzie
prettyman
cottage
the
sale
of
one
of
them
would
have
averted
that
other
sale
which
was
to
cause
so
much
distress
to
a
poor
harmless
old
woman
when
do
you
wear
your
jewels
aunt
de
tracy
she
asked
gravely
i
have
not
worn
them
since
the
admiral
death
was
the
virtuous
reply
and
i
have
never
called
or
considered
them
mine
robinetta
they
are
the
de
tracy
jewels
when
carnaby
takes
his
place
as
the
head
of
the
house
they
will
be
his
he
will
see
that
his
wife
wears
them
on
the
proper
occasions
carnaby
wife
thought
robinette
why
she
may
be
born
he
may
never
have
a
wife
and
to
think
of
all
those
precious
stones
hiding
their
brightness
in
these
boxes
like
prisoners
in
a
dungeon
for
years
and
years
only
to
be
let
out
now
and
then
by
bates
and
benson
jingling
their
keys
like
jailers
and
this
house
is
a
prison
too
she
said
to
herself
a
prison
for
souls
and
the
thought
of
its
hoarded
wealth
made
her
indignant
all
this
hidden
treasure
in
a
house
where
there
was
never
enough
to
eat
where
guests
shivered
in
fireless
bedrooms
where
servants
would
not
stay
because
they
were
starved
and
carnaby
too
whose
youth
was
being
embittered
by
unnecessary
economies
carnaby
who
had
so
little
that
he
was
a
among
his
fellows
it
was
for
carnaby
these
sacrifices
were
being
made
strange
traditions
fetiches
of
family
pride
almost
as
grotesque
to
her
thinking
as
those
of
any
savages
under
the
sun
my
poor
dear
middy
she
thought
what
chance
has
he
brought
up
in
an
atmosphere
like
this
but
she
happened
to
raise
her
eyes
at
the
moment
and
to
see
the
actual
carnaby
of
the
moment
not
the
carnaby
her
gloomy
imagination
was
evoking
from
the
future
with
the
petty
hoard
of
maxims
preaching
down
his
heart
he
had
contrived
to
get
hold
of
the
marie
antoinette
pearls
without
his
knowledge
and
to
hang
them
around
his
neck
he
had
poised
the
montmorency
tiara
on
his
own
sleek
head
he
had
forced
a
heavy
bracelet
by
way
of
collar
round
rupert
throat
and
now
with
that
choking
and
goggling
unfortunate
held
in
his
arms
he
was
waltzing
on
tiptoe
about
the
farther
drawing
room
behind
the
unconscious
backs
of
de
tracy
and
miss
smeardon
he
only
a
careless
boy
thought
robinette
a
youngster
they
ca
have
poisoned
his
nature
yet
and
i
sure
he
has
a
good
heart
if
he
were
at
the
head
of
affairs
at
stoke
revel
instead
of
his
grandmother
i
wonder
what
would
be
done
in
the
matter
of
my
poor
old
nurse
robinette
stood
in
the
doorway
for
a
moment
before
going
up
to
her
room
her
whole
attitude
spoke
depression
as
carnaby
stole
up
behind
her
see
here
cousin
robin
i
ca
bear
to
have
you
go
on
like
this
do
take
prettyman
trouble
so
to
heart
we
do
something
do
something
myself
i
have
a
happy
thought
xix
lawyer
and
client
robinette
had
a
bad
night
after
the
jewel
exhibition
and
a
heavy
head
and
aching
eyes
prompted
her
to
ask
little
cummins
to
bring
her
breakfast
to
her
bedroom
it
was
touching
to
see
that
small
person
hovering
over
robinette
stirring
the
fire
sweeping
the
hearth
looping
back
the
curtains
tucking
the
slippers
out
of
sight
and
moving
about
the
room
like
a
mother
ministering
to
an
ailing
child
finally
she
staggered
in
with
the
heavy
breakfast
tray
that
she
had
carried
through
long
halls
and
up
the
stairs
and
put
it
on
the
table
by
the
bed
there
a
egg
that
cook
for
the
mistress
but
i
thought
you
needed
it
more
an
i
brewed
the
tea
meself
to
be
sure
she
cooed
an
i
spread
the
loaf
same
as
you
like
an
cut
the
bread
thin
an
one
o
the
roses
you
allers
wears
to
breakfast
an
would
your
erming
coat
be
a
comfort
dear
little
cummins
how
did
you
know
i
needed
comfort
how
did
you
guess
i
was
homesick
robinette
leaned
her
head
against
the
housemaid
rough
hand
always
stained
with
black
spots
that
would
give
way
to
no
scrubbing
from
morning
to
night
she
was
in
the
coal
scuttle
or
the
grate
or
the
saucer
of
black
lead
for
she
did
nothing
but
lay
fires
light
fires
feed
fires
and
tidy
up
after
fires
for
eight
or
nine
months
of
the
year
you
must
touch
me
i
ai
fit
there
smut
on
me
hashes
this
time
o
day
said
little
cummins
i
do
care
i
like
you
better
with
ashes
than
lots
of
people
without
you
must
stay
in
the
coal
scuttle
all
your
life
little
cummins
you
must
be
my
chambermaid
some
of
these
days
when
we
can
get
a
good
substitute
for
de
tracy
would
you
like
that
if
the
mistress
will
let
you
go
little
cummins
put
her
apron
up
to
her
eyes
and
from
its
depths
came
inarticulate
bursts
of
gratitude
and
joy
then
peeping
from
it
just
enough
to
see
the
way
to
the
door
she
ran
out
like
a
hare
and
secluded
herself
in
the
empty
until
she
was
sufficiently
herself
to
join
the
other
servants
robinette
finished
her
breakfast
and
dressed
she
had
lacked
courage
to
meet
the
family
party
although
she
longed
for
a
talk
with
mark
lavendar
it
was
entirely
normal
feminine
and
according
to
all
law
human
and
divine
but
it
appealed
also
to
her
sense
of
humour
that
she
should
feel
that
this
new
could
straighten
out
all
the
difficulties
in
the
path
she
waited
patiently
at
her
window
until
she
saw
him
walk
around
the
corner
of
the
house
under
the
cedars
and
up
the
twisting
path
his
head
bent
and
bare
his
hands
in
his
pockets
then
she
flung
her
blue
cape
over
her
shoulders
and
followed
him
lavendar
she
called
as
she
caught
up
with
his
slow
step
you
said
you
would
advise
me
a
little
let
us
sit
on
this
bench
a
moment
and
find
out
how
we
can
untangle
all
the
knots
into
which
aunt
de
tracy
tied
us
yesterday
i
am
so
afraid
of
her
that
i
am
sure
i
spoke
timidly
and
respectfully
to
her
at
first
but
perhaps
i
showed
more
feeling
at
the
end
than
i
should
i
am
willing
to
apologize
to
her
for
any
lack
of
courtesy
but
i
do
see
how
i
can
retract
anything
i
said
it
is
hard
for
you
lavendar
replied
because
you
have
a
natural
affection
for
your
mother
old
nurse
and
de
tracy
i
begin
to
believe
is
more
than
indifferent
to
her
she
has
some
active
dislike
perhaps
the
source
of
which
is
unknown
to
us
but
she
is
so
unjust
cried
robinette
i
never
heard
of
an
irish
landlord
in
a
novel
who
would
practice
such
a
piece
of
eviction
if
i
must
stand
by
and
see
it
done
then
i
shall
assert
my
right
to
provide
for
nurse
and
move
her
into
a
new
dwelling
after
you
left
the
drawing
room
last
night
i
begged
as
tactfully
as
i
could
that
aunt
de
tracy
would
sell
me
some
of
the
jewels
so
that
she
need
not
part
with
the
land
at
wittisham
she
was
very
angry
and
would
hear
of
it
then
i
proposed
buying
the
cottage
that
it
might
be
kept
in
the
family
and
she
was
furious
at
my
audacity
perhaps
the
niece
is
in
the
family
she
can
not
endure
anything
like
patronage
or
even
an
assumption
of
equality
said
lavendar
you
must
be
careful
there
should
i
be
likely
to
patronize
asked
robinette
reproachfully
no
but
your
acquaintance
with
your
aunt
is
a
very
brief
one
and
she
is
an
extraordinary
character
hard
to
understand
you
may
easily
stumble
on
a
prejudice
of
hers
at
every
step
i
should
like
to
understand
her
any
better
than
i
do
now
and
robinette
pushed
back
her
hair
rebelliously
will
you
be
my
client
for
about
five
minutes
asked
lavendar
yes
willingly
enough
for
i
see
nothing
before
me
but
to
take
nurse
prettyman
and
depart
in
the
first
steamer
for
america
loring
looked
as
if
she
were
quite
capable
of
this
rather
radical
proceeding
and
very
much
too
as
if
any
growing
love
for
lavendar
that
she
might
have
would
easily
give
way
under
this
new
pressure
of
circumstances
this
is
the
situation
in
a
nutshell
said
lavendar
filling
his
pipe
de
tracy
is
entirely
within
her
legal
rights
when
she
asks
prettyman
to
leave
the
cottage
legally
right
also
when
she
declines
to
give
compensation
for
the
plum
tree
that
has
been
a
source
of
income
financially
right
moreover
in
selling
cottage
and
land
at
a
fancy
price
to
find
money
for
needed
improvements
on
the
estate
none
of
this
can
be
denied
i
allow
all
these
legal
rights
could
have
been
softened
if
de
tracy
had
been
willing
to
soften
them
but
unfortunately
she
has
been
put
on
the
defensive
she
did
not
like
it
when
i
opposed
her
in
the
first
place
she
did
not
like
it
when
my
father
advised
her
to
make
some
small
settlement
as
he
did
several
days
ago
she
resented
assumption
of
owning
the
plum
tree
she
was
outraged
at
your
valiant
espousing
of
your
nurse
cause
i
see
we
have
simply
made
her
more
determined
in
her
injustice
now
it
is
all
very
well
for
you
to
show
your
mettle
lavendar
went
on
for
you
to
endure
your
aunt
displeasure
rather
than
give
up
a
cause
you
know
to
be
just
but
look
where
it
lands
us
robinette
raised
her
troubled
eyes
to
lavendar
giving
a
sigh
to
show
she
realized
that
her
would
be
wherever
the
lawyer
fixed
it
not
where
she
wished
it
go
on
she
sighed
patiently
your
legal
adviser
regards
it
as
impossible
that
you
should
come
over
from
america
and
quarrel
with
your
mother
family
your
only
family
in
point
of
fact
if
this
affair
is
fought
to
a
finish
you
will
feel
like
leaving
your
aunt
house
i
should
have
to
wait
for
that
feeling
said
robinette
irrepressibly
aunt
de
tracy
would
have
it
first
in
such
an
event
i
could
and
would
stand
by
you
naturally
you
cried
robinette
glowing
instantly
like
a
jewel
lavendar
looked
at
her
in
amazement
pray
what
do
you
take
me
for
on
whose
side
could
i
should
i
be
my
dear
my
dear
loring
but
to
keep
to
business
in
the
event
stated
above
neither
my
father
nor
i
could
very
well
continue
to
have
charge
of
the
estate
that
is
a
small
matter
but
increases
the
difficulties
owing
to
a
long
friendship
dating
back
to
the
admiral
time
then
we
have
carnaby
carnaby
my
dear
loring
belongs
to
you
do
you
want
to
give
him
up
he
adores
you
and
you
will
have
an
unbounded
influence
on
him
if
you
choose
to
exercise
it
how
can
i
influence
carnaby
in
america
this
was
a
blow
but
lavendar
made
no
sign
you
may
not
always
be
in
america
he
said
now
why
not
let
de
tracy
sell
the
land
and
cottage
and
plum
tree
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
oh
how
i
wish
could
buy
the
blessed
thing
he
exclaimed
parenthetically
oh
how
i
wish
could
buy
the
plum
tree
and
keep
it
always
blossoming
in
my
sighed
robinette
but
unfortunately
waller
will
buy
the
plum
tree
confound
him
now
just
after
de
tracy
has
definitely
sold
the
premises
and
all
their
appurtenances
suppose
you
in
your
prettiest
and
most
docile
way
docility
not
being
your
strong
point
ask
your
aunt
if
she
has
any
objection
to
your
taking
care
of
prettyman
during
the
few
years
remaining
to
her
meantime
keep
her
from
irritating
de
tracy
and
make
the
poor
old
dear
happy
with
plans
for
her
future
if
you
are
short
on
docility
you
are
long
on
making
people
happy
never
did
i
hear
such
an
argument
it
would
make
macduff
fall
into
the
arms
of
macbeth
it
would
tranquillize
the
kilkenny
cats
themselves
i
run
in
and
apologize
abjectly
to
my
thrice
guilty
aunt
then
i
reward
myself
by
going
over
to
wittisham
if
you
take
the
ferry
over
i
like
to
come
and
fetch
you
if
i
may
that
shall
be
my
reward
reward
for
what
for
giving
you
advice
very
much
against
my
personal
inclinations
courses
of
action
founded
entirely
on
policy
do
not
appeal
to
me
very
strongly
xx
the
new
home
it
was
in
rather
a
chastened
spirit
that
robinette
set
off
to
see
prettyman
i
been
foolish
i
been
imprudent
oh
dear
me
still
so
much
to
learn
she
sighed
to
herself
no
good
is
ever
done
by
losing
one
temper
it
only
puts
everything
wrong
i
shall
have
to
try
and
take
lavendar
advice
i
must
be
very
prudent
with
nurse
this
morning
never
show
her
that
i
think
aunt
de
tracy
is
in
the
wrong
just
persuade
her
ever
so
gently
to
move
to
another
home
and
arrange
with
her
where
it
is
to
be
it
is
always
difficult
for
an
impetuous
nature
like
robinette
to
hold
back
about
anything
she
would
have
liked
to
run
straight
into
prettyman
room
and
flinging
her
arms
round
the
old
neck
cry
out
to
her
that
everything
was
settled
and
instead
she
must
come
to
the
point
gently
prudently
wisely
like
other
people
as
she
said
to
herself
the
cottage
seemed
very
still
that
afternoon
and
robinette
knocked
twice
before
she
heard
the
piping
old
voice
cry
out
to
her
to
come
in
why
nurse
dear
where
are
you
were
you
asleep
robinette
said
as
she
entered
for
prettyman
was
not
sitting
in
the
fine
new
chair
then
she
found
that
the
voice
answered
from
the
little
bedroom
off
the
kitchen
and
that
the
old
woman
was
in
bed
i
ai
ill
so
to
speak
dear
just
weary
in
me
bones
she
explained
as
robinette
sat
down
beside
her
and
darke
me
neighbour
she
sez
to
me
do
take
the
day
in
bed
prettyman
me
dear
an
i
do
your
bit
of
work
for
so
i
be
missie
right
enough
i
afraid
you
were
worried
yesterday
said
robinette
worried
about
leaving
the
house
i
were
missie
i
were
she
confessed
that
why
i
came
you
must
stop
worrying
for
i
settled
all
about
it
i
spoke
to
my
aunt
last
night
and
it
true
that
you
have
to
leave
this
house
but
now
i
come
to
make
arrangements
with
you
about
a
new
one
the
old
woman
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
and
gave
a
little
cry
that
went
straight
to
robinette
heart
lor
now
miss
am
i
ever
to
leave
this
place
where
i
been
all
these
years
i
thought
yesterday
as
you
said
was
a
mistake
made
but
alas
it
was
altogether
a
mistake
robinette
had
to
confess
sadly
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
as
she
realized
how
she
had
only
doubled
her
old
friend
disappointment
then
she
sat
forward
and
took
prettyman
hand
in
hers
nursie
dear
she
said
i
do
want
you
to
grieve
about
leaving
the
old
home
for
it
is
an
awfully
good
one
the
new
one
is
going
to
be
ever
so
much
better
that
so
i
sure
dearie
only
is
faltered
prettyman
if
you
spared
to
my
age
missie
you
find
as
new
things
scare
you
ah
but
not
a
new
house
nursie
wait
till
i
describe
it
everything
strong
and
firm
about
it
not
shaking
in
the
storms
as
this
one
does
nice
bright
windows
to
let
in
all
the
sunshine
so
no
more
and
no
more
tears
of
pain
in
your
dear
old
eyes
robinette
voice
failed
suddenly
for
it
struck
her
all
in
a
moment
that
her
glowing
description
of
the
new
home
seemed
to
have
in
it
something
prophetic
that
bent
little
figure
beside
her
these
shaking
limbs
and
dim
old
eyes
all
this
house
of
life
once
so
carefully
builded
was
crumbling
again
into
the
dust
and
its
tenant
indeed
wanted
a
new
one
quite
quite
different
a
sob
rose
in
throat
but
she
swallowed
it
down
and
went
on
gaily
i
settled
about
another
thing
too
you
to
have
another
plum
tree
or
life
would
be
the
same
thing
to
you
and
you
know
they
can
transplant
quite
big
trees
and
make
them
grow
wonderfully
some
one
was
telling
me
all
about
how
it
is
done
only
a
few
days
ago
they
dig
them
up
ever
so
carefully
and
when
they
put
them
into
the
new
hole
every
tiny
root
is
spread
out
and
laid
in
the
right
direction
in
the
ground
and
patted
and
coaxed
in
and
made
firm
and
they
just
catch
hold
on
the
soil
in
the
twinkle
of
an
eye
is
it
marvellous
well
i
have
a
fine
new
tree
planted
for
you
so
cleverly
that
perhaps
by
next
year
you
be
having
a
few
plums
who
knows
and
the
next
year
more
plums
and
the
next
year
jam
be
beautiful
sure
enough
said
the
old
woman
kindling
at
last
under
the
description
of
all
these
joys
and
do
you
think
missie
as
the
new
cottage
will
really
be
curing
of
me
rheumatics
why
yes
nurse
whoever
heard
of
rheumatism
in
a
dry
new
house
the
house
be
new
but
the
rheumatics
be
old
said
prettyman
sagely
well
we
ca
make
entirely
new
but
we
do
our
best
going
to
enquire
about
a
nice
cottage
not
very
far
from
here
plenty
of
time
before
this
one
is
sold
it
shall
be
dry
and
warm
and
cosy
and
you
will
feel
another
person
in
it
altogether
these
new
houses
be
terrible
dear
bai
they
the
old
woman
said
anxiously
not
a
bit
besides
that
another
matter
i
want
to
settle
with
you
nursie
i
going
to
pay
the
rent
always
and
you
going
to
have
a
nice
little
girl
to
help
you
with
the
work
and
there
will
be
something
paid
to
you
each
month
so
that
you
wo
have
any
anxiety
oh
missie
missie
whatever
be
you
sayin
never
to
have
no
anxiety
again
you
never
shall
if
i
can
help
it
old
people
should
never
have
worries
that
what
young
people
are
here
for
to
look
after
them
and
keep
them
happy
prettyman
lay
back
on
the
pillow
and
gazed
at
robinette
incredulously
it
was
possible
that
such
a
solution
had
come
to
all
her
troubles
for
seventy
odd
years
she
had
worked
and
struggled
and
sometimes
very
nearly
starved
and
here
was
some
one
assuring
her
that
these
struggles
were
over
forever
that
she
need
work
hard
any
more
or
ever
worry
again
could
it
be
true
and
all
to
come
from
miss
cynthia
daughter
robinette
bent
down
and
kissed
the
wrinkled
old
face
softly
nursie
dear
she
said
i
not
going
to
stay
any
longer
with
you
because
you
tired
have
a
good
sleep
and
waken
up
strong
and
bright
missie
dear
the
old
woman
said
her
face
had
taken
on
an
expression
of
such
peacefulness
as
it
had
never
worn
before
she
turned
over
on
her
pillow
and
closed
her
eyes
scarcely
waiting
for
robinette
to
leave
the
room
i
been
allowed
to
do
that
anyway
robinette
said
to
herself
standing
in
the
doorway
to
look
back
at
the
quiet
sleeper
and
then
looking
forward
to
a
little
boat
nearing
the
shore
the
cottage
sheltered
almost
the
only
object
that
connected
her
with
her
past
the
boat
she
felt
held
all
her
future
the
river
when
lavendar
rowed
himself
across
it
was
very
quiet
the
swelling
of
jordan
as
robinette
called
the
rising
tide
was
over
now
the
glassy
water
reflected
every
leaf
and
twig
from
the
trees
that
hung
above
its
banks
and
dipped
into
it
here
and
there
mooring
his
boat
at
the
landing
mark
sauntered
up
to
cottage
and
having
tapped
lightly
at
the
door
to
let
loring
know
of
his
arrival
as
they
had
agreed
he
should
do
he
went
along
the
flagged
pathway
into
the
garden
and
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
low
wall
that
divided
it
from
the
river
just
in
front
of
him
was
the
little
worn
bench
where
he
had
first
seen
robinette
as
she
sat
beside
her
old
nurse
with
the
tiny
shoe
on
her
lap
it
was
scarcely
a
fortnight
ago
yet
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
hardly
remember
the
kind
of
man
he
had
been
that
afternoon
a
new
self
full
of
a
new
purpose
and
at
that
moment
of
a
new
hope
had
taken
the
place
of
the
objectless
being
he
had
been
before
everything
was
very
still
there
was
scarcely
a
sound
from
the
village
or
from
the
shipping
farther
down
the
river
lavendar
fancied
he
heard
robinette
clear
voice
within
the
cottage
then
he
started
suddenly
and
the
blood
rushed
to
his
heart
as
he
listened
to
her
light
steps
coming
along
the
paved
footpath
here
you
are
she
whispered
let
us
not
speak
too
loud
for
nurse
was
just
dropping
asleep
when
i
left
her
i
put
a
and
a
blanket
over
mackenzie
to
keep
her
from
quacking
prettyman
has
not
been
very
well
poor
dear
and
is
in
bed
we
just
talked
about
the
lovely
new
home
she
going
to
have
and
the
transplanted
plum
tree
small
but
warranted
to
bear
in
a
year
or
two
and
give
plums
and
jam
like
this
one
i
left
her
so
happy
she
stopped
and
looked
up
oh
can
any
new
tree
be
as
beautiful
as
this
one
was
ever
anything
in
the
world
more
exquisite
it
has
just
come
to
its
hour
of
perfection
lavendar
it
last
anything
so
lovely
in
a
passing
world
she
sat
down
on
the
low
wall
and
looked
up
at
the
tree
it
stood
and
shone
there
in
its
perfect
hour
another
day
and
the
blossoms
too
fully
blown
would
begin
to
drift
upon
the
ground
with
every
little
shaking
wind
now
it
was
at
its
zenith
a
miracle
of
such
white
beauty
that
it
caused
the
heart
to
stop
and
consider
bees
and
butterflies
hummed
and
flew
around
it
it
cast
a
delicate
shadow
on
the
grass
and
leaning
across
the
wall
it
was
imaged
again
in
the
river
like
a
bride
in
her
robinette
sat
gazing
at
the
tree
and
lavendar
sat
gazing
at
her
at
that
moment
he
feared
his
fate
too
much
to
break
the
silence
by
any
question
that
might
shatter
his
hope
as
the
first
breeze
would
break
the
picture
that
had
taken
shape
in
the
glassy
water
beneath
them
i
feel
in
a
better
temper
now
said
robinette
who
could
be
angry
and
look
at
that
beautiful
thing
i
left
dear
old
nurse
quite
happy
again
and
i
have
yet
offended
aunt
de
tracy
irrevocably
and
all
because
you
persuaded
me
not
to
be
unreasonable
all
the
same
i
could
do
it
again
in
another
minute
if
i
let
myself
go
does
injustice
ever
make
people
angry
in
england
lavendar
laughed
it
often
makes
me
feel
angry
but
i
never
found
that
throwing
the
reins
on
the
horses
necks
when
they
wanted
to
bolt
made
one
go
along
the
right
road
any
faster
in
the
end
i
often
think
said
robinette
if
we
could
see
people
really
angry
and
disagreeable
before
we
she
hesitated
and
added
get
to
know
them
well
we
should
be
so
much
more
careful
yes
said
mark
bending
down
his
head
and
speaking
very
deliberately
that
why
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
me
in
all
my
worst
moments
i
stand
the
shame
of
it
if
you
could
only
know
but
alas
one
ca
show
off
one
worst
moments
to
order
they
must
be
hit
upon
unexpectedly
i
do
believe
thirty
years
of
life
would
teach
one
about
some
people
they
are
so
said
robinette
musingly
she
had
risen
and
leaned
against
the
plum
tree
for
a
moment
looking
up
through
the
white
branches
lavendar
rose
and
stood
beside
her
thirty
years
i
shall
be
getting
on
to
seventy
in
thirty
years
a
little
gust
of
wind
shook
the
tree
some
petals
came
drifting
down
upon
them
like
white
moths
like
flakes
of
summer
snow
a
warning
that
the
brief
hour
of
perfection
would
soon
be
past
and
under
it
human
creatures
were
talking
about
thirty
years
xxi
carnaby
cuts
the
knot
that
afternoon
carnaby
was
having
what
he
called
an
absolutely
mouldy
time
and
since
his
leave
was
running
out
and
his
remaining
afternoons
were
few
he
considered
himself
an
injured
individual
robinette
and
lavendar
seemed
for
ever
preoccupied
either
with
each
other
or
with
some
subject
of
discussion
the
ins
and
outs
of
which
they
had
not
confided
to
him
it
partly
that
blessed
plum
tree
he
said
to
himself
but
of
course
they
spooning
too
very
likely
they
engaged
by
this
time
did
i
tell
her
she
marry
again
well
if
she
must
it
might
as
well
be
old
lavendar
as
anyone
else
he
a
decent
chap
or
he
was
before
he
fell
in
love
carnaby
sighed
this
effort
of
generosity
towards
his
rival
made
him
feel
peculiarly
disconsolate
he
had
fished
and
rowed
on
the
river
all
the
morning
he
had
ferreted
he
had
fed
rupert
with
a
private
preparation
of
rabbits
which
infallibly
made
him
sick
the
desired
result
being
obtained
with
almost
provoking
celerity
thus
even
success
had
palled
and
carnaby
sharp
and
idle
wits
had
begun
to
work
on
the
problem
which
seemed
to
be
occupying
his
elders
neither
robinette
nor
lavendar
could
expatiate
to
the
boy
on
his
peculiarities
but
carnaby
had
contrived
to
find
out
for
himself
how
the
land
lay
why
is
waller
so
keen
on
the
plum
tree
he
had
enquired
he
wants
to
make
a
quartette
of
studies
answered
lavendar
the
plum
tree
in
spring
summer
autumn
and
winter
what
a
rotten
idea
said
carnaby
simply
far
from
rotten
my
young
friend
i
can
assure
you
lavendar
returned
it
will
furnish
coloured
illustrations
for
countless
summer
numbers
of
the
and
lady
and
fill
waller
r
a
pockets
with
gold
some
of
which
will
shortly
filter
in
advance
into
the
stoke
revel
banking
account
we
hope
i
not
so
sure
about
that
said
carnaby
but
he
said
it
to
himself
while
aloud
he
only
asked
with
much
apparent
innocence
waller
would
look
at
the
cottage
or
the
land
without
the
plum
tree
i
suppose
certainly
not
lavendar
had
answered
the
plum
tree
is
safeguarded
in
the
agreement
as
i
sure
no
plum
tree
ever
was
before
waller
r
a
no
fool
digesting
this
information
and
much
else
that
he
had
gleaned
carnaby
now
climbed
to
the
top
of
a
tree
where
he
had
a
favourite
perch
and
did
some
serious
and
simple
thinking
it
a
beastly
shame
he
said
to
himself
to
turn
that
old
woman
out
of
her
cottage
cousin
robin
thinks
it
a
beastly
shame
and
what
more
mark
does
and
he
a
man
and
a
lawyer
into
the
bargain
carnaby
thought
remorsefully
of
a
pot
of
jam
which
old
prettyman
had
given
him
once
to
take
back
to
college
what
good
jam
it
had
been
and
how
large
the
pot
he
had
never
given
her
anything
he
had
never
a
penny
to
bless
himself
with
and
now
his
grandmother
was
taking
away
from
the
poor
old
creature
all
that
she
had
regular
covetousness
he
thought
and
that
infernal
plum
tree
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
naboth
vineyard
is
a
joke
in
comparison
and
and
the
one
ewe
lamb
simply
are
in
it
he
grew
hot
with
mortification
then
he
reflected
if
the
plum
tree
there
waller
would
want
the
cottage
and
old
prettyman
could
live
in
it
till
the
end
of
the
chapter
a
slow
grin
dawned
upon
his
face
its
most
mischievous
expression
the
one
which
rupert
with
canine
sagacity
had
learned
to
dread
he
felt
and
pinched
the
muscle
of
his
arm
fondly
he
always
spelled
the
word
himself
upon
phonetic
principles
i
may
be
a
fool
and
a
minor
generally
spelt
by
him
he
said
as
he
climbed
down
from
his
perch
but
at
least
i
can
cut
down
a
tree
he
became
lost
to
view
forthwith
in
the
workshops
and
attached
to
the
home
premises
of
stoke
revel
and
presently
emerged
furnished
with
the
object
he
had
made
diligent
and
particular
search
for
this
he
proceeded
to
carry
in
an
inconspicuous
way
to
a
distant
cottage
where
he
knew
there
was
a
grindstone
he
spent
a
happy
hour
with
the
object
the
grindstone
and
a
pail
of
water
sang
the
grindstone
now
softly
now
loudly
is
an
axe
an
axe
an
axe
and
a
strong
arm
that
holds
you
be
goin
to
do
a
bit
of
forestry
on
your
own
master
carnaby
eh
suggested
the
grinning
owner
of
the
grindstone
i
am
a
very
particular
bit
jones
replied
the
young
master
lovingly
feeling
the
edge
of
the
tool
which
was
now
nearly
as
fine
as
that
of
a
razor
you
be
careful
sir
as
you
do
chop
off
one
of
your
own
toes
with
that
there
axe
said
the
man
it
be
full
heavy
for
one
o
your
age
but
there
you
be
that
handy
is
your
trade
so
to
speak
quite
right
jones
it
is
replied
carnaby
and
thank
you
for
the
use
of
the
grindstone
he
was
already
planning
where
he
would
hide
the
axe
for
he
had
precise
ideas
about
everything
and
left
nothing
to
chance
carnaby
went
to
bed
that
night
at
his
usual
hour
his
profession
had
already
accustomed
him
to
awaking
at
odd
intervals
and
he
had
more
than
the
ordinary
boy
knowledge
of
moon
and
tide
night
and
dawn
when
he
slipped
out
of
bed
after
a
few
hours
of
sound
sleep
he
put
on
a
flannel
shirt
and
trousers
and
a
broad
belt
and
then
carrying
his
boots
in
his
hand
crept
out
of
his
room
and
through
the
sleeping
house
he
would
much
rather
have
climbed
out
of
the
window
in
a
manner
more
worthy
of
such
an
adventure
but
his
return
in
that
fashion
might
offer
dangers
in
daylight
so
he
was
content
with
an
unfrequented
garden
door
which
he
could
leave
on
the
latch
the
moon
which
had
been
young
when
she
lighted
the
lovers
in
the
adventure
was
now
a
more
experienced
orb
and
shed
a
useful
light
carnaby
intended
to
cross
the
river
in
a
small
tub
which
was
propelled
by
a
single
oar
worked
at
the
stern
the
rower
standing
this
craft
was
intended
for
pottering
about
the
shore
to
cross
the
river
in
it
was
the
dangerous
feat
of
a
skilled
waterman
but
carnaby
had
a
knack
of
his
own
with
every
floating
thing
as
he
balanced
himself
in
the
rocking
tub
paddling
with
the
grace
and
ease
of
strength
and
training
he
looked
a
man
but
a
man
young
with
the
youth
of
the
gods
the
moon
shone
in
his
keen
grey
eyes
and
made
them
sparkle
a
cold
blew
up
the
river
but
he
did
not
feel
its
chill
for
blood
hot
with
adventure
raced
in
his
veins
wittisham
was
in
profound
darkness
when
he
landed
and
the
moon
having
gone
behind
a
bank
of
cloud
he
had
to
grope
his
way
to
prettyman
cottage
shouldering
the
axe
the
isolated
position
of
the
house
alone
made
the
adventure
possible
he
reflected
he
could
not
have
cut
down
a
tree
in
the
hearing
of
neighbours
and
as
to
old
elizabeth
herself
he
hoped
she
was
deaf
most
old
women
were
he
reflected
except
unfortunately
his
grandmother
soon
he
was
entering
the
little
garden
and
sniffing
the
scent
of
blossom
which
was
very
strong
in
the
night
air
he
could
see
the
dim
outline
of
the
plum
tree
and
just
as
he
wanted
light
the
moon
came
out
and
shone
upon
its
whiteness
giving
a
sort
of
spiritual
beauty
to
the
flowering
thing
that
was
very
exquisite
what
price
waller
a
now
thought
carnaby
impishly
the
plum
tree
in
moonlight
eh
would
he
give
his
eyes
to
see
it
but
he
wo
not
if
i
know
it
the
boy
was
as
blind
to
the
tree
beauty
as
his
grandmother
had
been
but
he
had
scientific
ideas
how
to
cut
it
down
for
he
had
watched
the
felling
of
many
a
tree
first
standing
on
a
lower
branch
you
lopped
off
all
the
side
shoots
as
high
as
you
could
reach
this
made
the
trunk
easy
to
deal
with
and
its
fall
less
heavy
and
carnaby
set
to
work
she
goes
through
them
all
as
slick
as
butter
he
said
to
himself
in
high
satisfaction
the
axe
had
assumed
a
personality
to
him
and
was
she
not
it
she
makes
no
more
noise
than
a
pair
of
scissors
cutting
flowers
not
half
so
much
he
said
proudly
branch
after
branch
fell
down
and
lay
about
the
tree
like
the
discarded
garments
of
a
bathing
nymph
the
petals
fell
upon
carnaby
face
upon
his
hair
and
shoulders
he
was
a
white
figure
as
he
toiled
frightened
birds
and
bats
flew
about
but
he
did
not
notice
them
his
only
care
was
the
cottage
itself
and
its
inmate
if
should
awake
but
the
little
habitation
shrouded
in
thatch
and
deep
in
shadow
was
dark
and
silent
as
the
grave
she
must
be
sound
asleep
and
deaf
thought
the
boy
yes
very
deaf
he
paused
the
first
stage
in
his
task
was
accomplished
shivering
and
naked
one
absurd
tuft
of
blossom
and
leaves
at
the
tip
the
murdered
tree
now
stood
in
the
moonlight
imploring
the
de
which
should
end
its
shame
jolly
well
done
said
the
murderer
complacently
he
stretched
his
arms
looked
at
the
palms
of
his
hands
to
see
if
they
had
blistered
and
addressed
himself
to
the
second
part
of
his
business
thud
thud
went
the
axe
on
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
the
sweat
broke
out
all
over
carnaby
skin
not
with
exertion
but
with
nervous
terror
if
that
does
wake
the
dead
he
thought
but
there
was
no
awaking
in
the
cottage
its
tiny
window
blinked
in
the
moonlight
and
carnaby
thought
he
heard
the
drowsy
quack
of
a
duck
in
an
but
the
danger
passed
thud
went
the
axe
again
the
slim
severed
shaft
of
the
tree
was
poised
a
moment
motionless
erect
before
it
fell
then
it
subsided
gently
among
its
broken
and
trodden
boughs
and
task
was
done
xxii
consequences
early
that
morning
before
the
sun
had
risen
when
the
light
was
still
grey
in
the
coming
dawn
robinette
was
awakened
by
a
bird
that
called
out
from
a
tree
close
to
her
open
window
every
note
like
the
striking
of
a
golden
bell
she
jumped
up
and
looked
out
but
the
little
singer
silenced
had
flown
away
instead
she
caught
sight
of
a
figure
stealing
across
the
lawn
towards
the
side
door
which
opened
from
the
library
even
in
the
dim
light
she
could
distinguish
that
it
was
carnaby
carnaby
with
something
in
his
hand
what
he
carried
she
could
not
quite
make
out
but
the
sleeves
of
his
flannel
shirt
were
rolled
up
above
his
elbows
in
a
fatally
way
and
he
walked
with
an
air
of
stealth
what
mischief
can
that
boy
have
been
up
to
at
this
time
of
day
thought
robinette
as
she
lay
down
again
but
she
was
too
sleepy
to
wonder
long
she
forgot
all
about
it
until
she
saw
carnaby
at
the
breakfast
table
some
hours
later
sometimes
the
gloom
of
that
meal
never
a
favorite
or
convivial
one
in
the
english
household
and
most
certainly
neither
at
stoke
revel
would
be
enlivened
by
some
of
the
boy
pranks
he
would
pass
over
to
the
sideboard
slyly
in
hand
and
rupert
whose
meal
at
this
hour
consisted
of
and
cream
would
unaccountably
sneeze
and
snuffle
over
his
plate
bless
it
bobs
his
tormentor
would
exclaim
tenderly
is
it
catching
cold
poor
old
kitchener
hi
like
a
violent
sneeze
and
the
outraged
rupert
would
forget
and
pepper
alike
in
a
fit
of
impotent
fury
but
this
morning
the
dog
fed
in
peace
and
carnaby
never
glanced
at
him
or
his
basin
robinette
looking
at
the
boy
and
remembering
where
she
had
seen
him
last
noticed
that
he
was
rather
silent
that
his
cheeks
were
redder
than
common
and
that
under
his
eyes
were
lines
of
fatigue
not
usually
there
what
were
you
doing
on
the
lawn
at
four
this
morning
she
began
but
checked
herself
suddenly
thinking
that
if
carnaby
had
been
up
to
mischief
she
must
not
allude
to
it
before
his
grandmother
no
one
had
heard
her
the
meal
dragged
on
robinette
and
lavendar
talked
little
miss
smeardon
was
preoccupied
with
the
sufferings
and
the
moods
of
rupert
de
tracy
alone
seemed
in
better
spirits
than
usual
she
was
talkative
and
even
balmy
the
work
at
the
spinney
begins
she
observed
complacently
addressing
herself
to
lavendar
and
alluding
to
the
rooting
up
of
an
old
copse
and
the
planting
of
a
new
one
an
improvement
she
had
long
planned
though
hitherto
in
vain
the
young
trees
have
arrived
but
where
is
the
money
to
come
from
enquired
carnaby
suddenly
in
a
sepulchral
tone
his
voice
was
at
the
disagreeable
breaking
stage
an
agony
and
a
shame
to
himself
and
always
a
surprise
to
others
his
grandmother
stared
the
others
too
looked
in
astonishment
at
the
boy
red
face
i
thought
it
had
all
been
explained
to
you
carnaby
said
de
tracy
but
you
take
so
little
interest
in
the
estate
that
i
suppose
what
you
have
been
told
went
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
other
as
usual
it
is
the
sale
of
land
at
wittisham
which
makes
these
improvements
possible
advantages
drawn
from
a
painful
necessity
and
the
iron
woman
almost
sighed
there
wo
be
any
sale
of
land
at
wittisham
at
least
not
of
prettyman
cottage
said
carnaby
abruptly
it
is
practically
settled
the
transfers
only
remain
to
be
signed
you
know
that
carnaby
said
lavendar
curtly
he
did
not
wish
the
vexed
question
to
be
raised
again
at
a
meal
it
practically
settled
but
it
all
off
now
said
the
boy
looking
hard
at
his
grandmother
waller
wo
want
the
place
any
more
the
bloomin
plum
tree
gone
cut
down
the
bargain
off
and
old
prettyman
can
stay
on
in
her
cottage
as
long
as
she
likes
there
was
a
freezing
silence
broken
only
by
the
stertorous
breathing
of
rupert
on
miss
smeardon
lap
repeat
please
what
you
have
just
said
carnaby
said
his
grandmother
with
dangerous
calmness
and
speak
distinctly
i
said
that
the
cottage
at
wittisham
wo
be
sold
because
the
plum
tree
gone
repeated
carnaby
doggedly
it
been
cut
down
how
do
you
know
i
seen
it
carnaby
raised
his
eyes
i
cut
it
down
myself
he
added
this
morning
before
daylight
who
put
such
a
thing
into
your
head
de
tracy
words
were
ice
her
glance
of
suspicion
at
robinette
like
the
cold
thrust
of
steel
who
told
you
to
cut
the
plum
tree
down
my
conscience
was
carnaby
unexpected
reply
he
was
as
red
as
fire
but
his
glance
did
not
falter
de
tracy
rose
not
a
muscle
of
her
face
had
moved
whatever
your
action
has
been
carnaby
she
said
with
dignity
whether
foolish
and
disgraceful
or
criminal
and
dangerous
it
can
not
be
discussed
here
you
will
follow
me
at
once
to
the
library
and
presently
i
may
send
for
mark
a
lawyer
advice
will
probably
be
necessary
she
added
grimly
carnaby
said
not
a
word
he
opened
the
door
for
his
grandmother
and
followed
her
out
but
as
he
passed
robinette
he
looked
at
her
earnestly
half
expecting
her
applause
for
one
of
the
motives
in
his
boyish
mind
had
certainly
been
to
please
her
to
shine
in
her
eyes
as
the
doer
of
bold
deeds
and
to
avenge
her
nurse
wrongs
and
all
that
he
had
managed
was
to
make
her
cry
for
robinette
had
put
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
had
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
as
he
left
the
room
carnaby
could
hear
her
exclamation
to
cut
down
that
tree
that
beautiful
beautiful
fruitful
thing
o
how
could
anyone
do
it
so
this
was
justice
this
was
all
he
got
for
his
pains
how
unaccountable
women
were
lavendar
awaited
some
time
his
summons
to
join
de
tracy
and
her
grandson
in
what
seemed
to
him
must
be
a
portentous
interview
enough
trying
meanwhile
somewhat
unsuccessfully
to
console
loring
for
the
destruction
of
the
plum
tree
and
exchanging
with
her
somewhat
comments
on
the
scene
they
had
both
just
witnessed
no
summons
came
however
but
half
an
hour
later
he
came
across
carnaby
alone
and
an
interview
promptly
ensued
he
wanted
to
plumb
the
depth
of
the
and
to
learn
exactly
what
motives
had
prompted
carnaby
to
this
sudden
and
startling
action
in
the
matter
of
the
plum
tree
had
you
a
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
with
your
grandmother
was
his
first
question
carnaby
he
thought
looked
subdued
and
not
much
wonder
the
boy
hesitated
not
so
bad
as
i
expected
was
his
answer
the
old
lady
was
wonderfully
decent
for
her
she
gave
me
a
talking
to
of
course
i
should
hope
so
interpolated
lavendar
drily
she
jawed
away
about
our
poverty
continued
carnaby
she
got
that
on
the
brain
as
you
know
she
said
that
this
loss
of
the
money
waller
r
a
money
she
means
of
course
is
an
awful
blow
she
it
was
but
it
seemed
to
me
carnaby
paused
looking
extremely
puzzled
it
seemed
to
you
prompted
lavendar
encouragingly
that
she
was
so
awfully
cut
up
after
all
said
carnaby
she
seemed
putting
it
on
if
you
know
what
i
mean
lavendar
pricked
up
his
ears
de
tracy
intense
reluctance
to
sell
the
land
recurred
to
him
in
a
flash
to
get
her
consent
had
been
like
drawing
a
tooth
like
taking
her
drop
by
drop
could
it
be
that
she
was
not
very
sorry
after
all
that
the
scheme
had
fallen
through
secretly
glad
indeed
it
was
conceivable
that
this
was
de
tracy
view
but
her
grandson
motive
was
still
obscure
why
did
you
do
it
carnaby
lavendar
asked
with
kindness
and
gravity
both
in
his
voice
you
have
committed
a
very
mischievous
action
you
know
one
that
would
have
borne
a
harsher
name
had
the
transfers
been
signed
and
had
the
plum
tree
changed
hands
but
then
i
should
have
done
it
you
you
juggins
mark
cried
the
boy
i
no
earthly
grudge
against
waller
a
if
he
actually
bought
the
tree
it
would
have
been
too
late
and
his
beastly
money
you
need
the
money
you
know
remarked
lavendar
remember
that
my
young
friend
it
would
have
been
dirty
money
said
carnaby
with
a
sudden
flash
that
lit
up
his
rather
heavy
face
with
a
new
expression
you
and
cousin
robin
have
been
jolly
polite
when
you
thought
i
was
listening
but
know
what
you
really
thought
and
the
kind
of
things
you
were
saying
to
one
another
about
this
business
you
thought
it
beastly
mean
to
take
the
cottage
away
from
old
lizzie
in
the
way
it
was
being
done
and
sheer
robbery
to
deprive
her
of
the
plum
tree
without
paying
her
for
it
i
quite
agreed
with
you
there
and
if
i
felt
like
that
do
you
think
i
could
sit
still
and
let
the
money
come
in
to
stoke
revel
money
that
had
been
got
in
such
a
way
what
do
you
take
me
for
lavendar
was
silent
looking
at
the
boy
in
surprise
oh
continued
carnaby
how
i
wish
i
were
of
age
then
i
could
show
cousin
robin
perhaps
what
an
english
landlord
can
be
i
mean
that
he
can
be
a
friend
to
his
tenants
and
kind
and
generous
as
well
as
just
as
it
is
cousin
robin
will
go
back
to
america
and
tell
her
friends
what
selfish
brutes
we
are
over
here
and
how
jolly
glad
she
was
to
get
away
loring
will
carry
no
tales
i
am
sure
said
lavendar
but
tell
me
my
dear
fellow
did
you
imagine
that
prettyman
would
be
a
gainer
by
your
action
well
why
not
answered
the
boy
did
you
tell
me
yourself
that
waller
would
look
at
the
cottage
without
the
tree
what
to
prevent
the
old
woman
living
on
where
she
is
do
you
think
there
be
a
rush
of
new
tenants
for
that
precious
old
hovel
go
on
you
know
better
than
that
but
the
tree
carnaby
the
plum
tree
cried
lavendar
my
young
goth
had
you
a
moment
compunction
that
beautiful
flowering
thing
as
your
cousin
called
it
could
you
destroy
it
without
a
pang
the
echoed
carnaby
with
unmeasured
scorn
what
a
tree
it
just
a
tree
is
it
a
primrose
by
a
river
brim
a
yellow
primrose
was
to
him
and
it
was
nothing
more
quoted
mark
despairingly
well
and
what
more
did
he
expect
of
a
primrose
whoever
the
johnny
was
asked
the
contemptuous
carnaby
at
any
rate
commented
lavendar
it
is
necessary
to
search
as
far
as
peter
bell
for
an
analogy
for
your
character
my
young
friend
you
are
your
grandmother
grandson
after
all
in
some
ways
i
suppose
i
ca
help
being
answered
carnaby
soberly
but
not
in
all
he
added
and
suddenly
turning
red
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
produced
a
coin
which
he
held
out
to
lavendar
it
only
ten
bob
he
said
apologetically
and
i
wish
it
was
a
jolly
sight
more
but
please
give
it
to
old
prettyman
to
make
up
a
bit
for
the
loss
of
her
plums
daresay
i
manage
some
more
by
and
by
anyway
i
make
it
up
to
her
when
i
come
of
i
nearly
sixteen
already
you
know
be
sure
you
tell
her
that
but
lavendar
refused
to
take
the
money
prettyman
is
provided
for
my
boy
he
said
she
has
become
your
cousin
especial
care
you
need
have
no
fear
about
that
the
poor
old
woman
is
very
happy
and
will
have
a
cottage
more
suited
for
her
rheumatism
and
her
general
feebleness
than
the
present
one
but
i
think
your
cousin
will
understand
your
motives
and
believe
that
you
meant
well
by
old
lizzie
in
your
little
piece
of
midnight
madness
though
i
was
a
bit
rough
on
the
plum
tree
said
carnaby
with
a
broad
smile
you
think
it
a
laughing
matter
lavendar
asked
indignantly
i
wish
you
had
my
father
to
deal
with
and
waller
it
all
very
well
for
you
but
carnaby
only
laughed
the
blood
was
still
hot
in
his
veins
and
the
joy
of
his
night
adventure
mark
told
him
that
he
and
loring
were
crossing
the
river
at
once
to
see
for
themselves
the
extent
of
his
mischief
and
what
effect
it
had
had
upon
old
prettyman
carnaby
observed
with
diabolical
meaning
that
as
he
had
not
been
invited
to
join
the
party
he
would
make
himself
scarce
gooseberries
he
said
were
very
good
fruit
but
he
was
fond
of
them
so
he
lounged
off
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
suddenly
he
turned
see
here
old
mark
you
speak
a
word
for
me
with
cousin
robin
wo
you
it
hard
on
me
to
have
her
hate
me
when
i
was
trying
to
do
my
best
to
please
her
she
wo
hate
you
she
could
hate
anybody
said
lavendar
absently
watching
first
the
door
and
then
the
window
you
say
that
because
you
in
love
with
her
i
a
couple
of
eyes
in
my
head
stupid
as
you
all
think
me
you
can
deny
it
all
you
like
but
you
wo
convince
me
i
sha
deny
it
carnaby
i
am
so
much
in
love
with
her
at
this
moment
that
the
room
is
whirling
round
and
round
and
i
can
see
two
of
you
poor
old
mark
do
you
think
she
take
you
on
ca
say
carnaby
you
a
lucky
beggar
if
she
does
that
my
opinion
said
the
boy
put
it
as
strong
as
you
like
carnaby
lavendar
answered
you
exaggerate
my
feelings
on
that
subject
if
you
had
fifteen
years
start
of
me
i
give
you
a
run
for
your
money
exclaimed
carnaby
with
a
daring
look
xxiii
death
and
life
while
these
incidents
were
taking
place
at
the
manor
house
village
life
at
wittisham
had
been
stirring
for
hours
thin
blue
threads
of
smoke
were
rising
from
the
other
cottages
into
the
windless
air
only
from
nurse
prettyman
there
was
none
duckie
in
the
quacked
and
gabbled
as
she
had
quacked
and
gabbled
since
the
light
began
yet
no
one
came
to
let
her
out
and
feed
her
the
halfpenny
jug
of
milk
had
been
placed
on
the
doorstep
long
ago
but
prettyman
had
not
yet
opened
the
door
to
take
it
in
outside
in
the
garden
where
the
plum
tree
stood
yesterday
there
was
now
only
a
stump
hacked
and
denuded
and
round
about
it
a
ruin
of
broken
branches
leaves
and
scattered
blossoms
over
the
wreck
the
bees
were
busy
still
taking
what
they
could
of
the
honey
that
remained
and
in
the
air
was
the
strong
odour
of
juicy
green
wood
and
torn
bark
the
children
who
brought
the
milk
were
the
first
to
discover
what
had
happened
and
very
soon
the
news
spread
amongst
the
other
cottagers
then
came
two
neighbours
to
the
scene
wondering
and
exclaiming
they
went
to
the
door
but
prettyman
did
not
answer
their
knock
or
their
calling
darke
looked
in
through
the
tiny
window
she
be
sleepin
that
peaceful
in
bed
in
there
she
said
it
be
a
shame
to
wake
she
deaf
now
and
belike
she
never
the
tree
come
down
done
it
but
i
go
and
see
after
duckie
she
makin
noise
enough
to
rouse
anyway
then
duckie
was
released
and
fed
and
departed
to
gabble
her
wrongs
to
the
other
white
ducks
that
were
preening
themselves
amongst
the
deep
green
grass
of
the
adjacent
orchard
you
can
that
bird
a
mile
away
she
never
done
talking
said
darke
as
the
indignant
gabble
grew
fainter
in
the
distance
but
my
old
man
to
look
at
the
plum
tree
wonder
what
say
to
it
this
be
a
queer
job
sure
enough
old
darke
on
two
sticks
hobbled
towards
the
scene
of
desolation
with
grunts
of
mingled
satisfaction
and
dismay
was
a
rare
sensation
though
a
pity
to
be
sure
darke
stood
by
the
well
at
the
turn
of
the
road
keeping
a
sharp
eye
on
the
cottage
while
she
gossiped
with
the
neighbour
who
was
filling
her
pitcher
she
did
not
want
to
miss
the
sight
of
prettyman
face
when
she
opened
her
door
and
found
out
what
had
happened
she
be
sleepin
too
long
i
go
and
waken
her
in
a
minute
said
darke
is
but
right
she
should
be
told
what
come
to
tree
poor
thing
then
a
beggar
woman
selling
bootlaces
came
along
the
shore
of
the
river
she
mounted
the
cottage
steps
and
the
gossips
watched
her
trailing
up
the
pathway
in
her
loose
old
shoes
and
knocking
at
the
door
she
waited
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
no
answer
so
she
turned
away
resignedly
and
trailed
off
along
the
lane
leaving
the
garden
gate
swinging
to
and
fro
there
summat
the
matter
darke
had
just
whispered
with
evident
enjoyment
when
some
one
else
was
seen
approaching
the
cottage
from
the
direction
of
the
pier
it
was
the
young
lady
from
the
manor
this
time
she
wore
a
white
dress
and
a
green
scarf
and
her
face
was
tinted
with
colour
she
looked
like
a
young
blossoming
tree
herself
all
lacy
white
and
pale
green
a
strange
morning
vision
in
a
world
robinette
ran
quickly
up
the
pathway
and
knocked
at
the
door
but
there
was
no
answer
to
her
knock
she
called
out
in
her
clear
voice
good
morning
nurse
good
morning
are
you
ready
to
let
me
in
it
quite
late
but
there
was
no
answer
to
her
call
she
was
just
trying
to
open
the
door
which
seemed
to
be
locked
when
a
gentleman
came
up
from
the
boat
and
followed
her
to
the
cottage
that
the
women
who
were
watching
her
thought
quite
natural
for
surely
such
a
young
lady
would
be
followed
by
a
lover
wherever
she
went
indeed
darke
said
so
is
in
that
there
kind
she
observed
philosophically
like
the
cuckoo
and
the
bird
that
follows
never
sees
one
the
other
is
quite
that
way
darke
agreed
the
neighbour
approvingly
robinette
turned
a
white
face
to
lavendar
as
he
approached
nurse
wo
answer
and
i
ca
get
in
she
cried
something
must
have
happened
i
i
afraid
to
go
in
alone
the
door
is
locked
too
it
not
locked
said
lavendar
and
exerting
a
little
strength
he
pushed
it
open
and
gave
a
quick
glance
inside
i
go
in
first
he
said
gently
wait
here
he
came
again
to
the
threshold
in
a
few
minutes
a
peculiar
expression
on
his
face
which
somehow
seemed
to
tell
robinette
what
had
happened
come
in
robin
he
said
very
gravely
and
gently
you
need
not
be
afraid
robinette
instinctively
held
out
her
hand
to
him
and
they
entered
the
little
room
together
she
need
not
have
feared
for
the
old
woman
distress
over
the
ruined
plum
tree
for
nothing
would
ever
grieve
nurse
prettyman
again
just
as
she
had
lain
down
the
night
before
she
lay
upon
her
bed
now
having
passed
away
in
her
sleep
and
they
that
encounter
death
in
sleep
says
the
old
writer
go
forth
to
meet
him
with
desire
the
aged
face
was
turned
slightly
upwards
and
wore
a
look
of
contentment
and
repose
that
made
life
seem
almost
gaudy
a
cheap
thing
to
compare
with
this
attainment
robinette
came
out
of
the
cottage
a
little
later
leaving
the
neighbours
who
had
gathered
in
the
room
to
their
familiar
and
not
uncongenial
duties
she
went
into
the
garden
where
mark
lavendar
awaited
her
he
longed
to
try
to
comfort
her
indeed
his
whole
heart
ran
out
to
her
in
a
warmth
and
passion
that
astounded
him
but
her
pale
face
stained
with
weeping
warned
him
to
keep
silence
yet
a
little
while
i
just
came
for
one
branch
of
the
blossom
robinette
said
if
it
is
not
all
withered
yes
this
is
quite
fresh
still
she
took
a
little
spray
he
had
found
for
her
and
stood
holding
it
as
she
spoke
only
yesterday
it
was
all
so
lovely
oh
lavendar
i
need
cry
for
my
old
nurse
i
sure
how
should
i
after
seeing
her
face
she
had
come
to
the
end
of
her
long
life
and
she
was
very
tired
and
now
all
that
is
forgotten
and
she
will
never
have
a
moment
of
vexation
about
her
tree
i
do
know
why
i
should
cry
for
her
but
oh
how
could
carnaby
destroy
that
beautiful
thing
it
was
a
genuine
though
mistaken
act
of
conscience
you
must
not
be
too
hard
on
carnaby
pleaded
lavendar
he
would
not
touch
the
money
that
was
to
come
from
the
sale
of
prettyman
cottage
under
the
circumstances
so
it
seemed
best
to
him
that
the
sale
should
not
take
place
and
he
prevented
it
in
the
directest
and
simplest
way
that
occurred
to
him
it
like
some
of
the
things
that
men
have
done
to
please
god
robin
mark
added
smiling
and
thought
they
were
doing
it
too
but
carnaby
only
wanted
to
please
you
to
me
exclaimed
robinette
looking
round
her
at
the
ruin
before
them
oh
dear
she
sighed
how
confusing
the
world
is
at
times
i
am
just
going
to
take
this
snowy
branch
and
lay
it
on
pillow
she
so
loved
her
tree
see
it
quite
fresh
and
beautiful
and
the
dew
still
upon
it
just
like
tears
that
seemed
just
right
said
robinette
softly
as
she
came
out
into
the
sunshine
again
a
few
minutes
later
i
laid
the
blossoms
in
her
kind
old
tired
hands
the
hands
that
have
known
so
much
work
and
so
many
pains
it
is
over
and
after
all
her
new
home
is
better
than
any
i
could
have
found
for
her
the
two
walked
slowly
down
the
little
garden
on
their
way
to
the
gate
as
they
passed
old
darke
who
had
hobbled
around
again
to
have
another
look
at
the
fallen
tree
addressed
lavendar
solemnly
best
tree
in
wittisham
was
sir
touching
the
ruin
of
the
branches
as
he
spoke
could
ha
thought
o
sich
a
piece
of
wickedness
as
to
cut
down
murder
i
calls
it
is
well
as
prettyman
be
gone
to
rest
knowledge
of
it
broken
her
old
for
certain
sure
it
nearly
breaks
mine
to
see
it
now
mr
darke
said
robinette
in
a
trembling
voice
but
the
old
labourer
bent
down
moving
his
creaking
joints
with
difficulty
and
steadying
himself
upon
his
sticks
till
he
could
touch
the
stump
of
the
tree
with
his
rough
but
skilful
hands
he
pushed
away
the
long
grass
that
grew
about
the
roots
and
looked
up
at
robinette
with
a
wise
old
smile
is
dead
and
done
for
yet
missy
never
fear
he
said
give
time
give
time
cut
above
the
graft
see
grow
and
shoot
and
bear
blossom
and
fruit
same
as
ever
did
given
time
see
to
the
fine
stock
of
firm
as
a
rock
in
the
good
ground
and
the
roots
they
be
sound
and
fresh
grow
again
missy
never
you
cry
robinette
looked
so
beautiful
as
she
lifted
her
luminous
eyes
and
parted
lips
to
old
darke
and
then
turned
to
him
with
a
gesture
of
hope
and
joy
that
again
lavendar
could
hardly
keep
from
avowing
his
love
but
the
remembrance
of
the
old
nurse
still
shape
in
the
little
cottage
hushed
the
words
that
trembled
on
his
lips
xxiv
grandmother
and
grandson
the
disagreeable
duty
of
announcing
prettyman
death
to
the
lady
of
the
manor
now
lay
before
lavendar
and
his
companion
and
the
thought
of
it
weighed
upon
their
spirits
as
they
crossed
the
river
carnaby
also
must
be
told
how
would
he
take
it
robinette
still
under
the
shock
of
the
plum
tree
undoing
expected
perhaps
some
further
exhibition
of
youthful
callousness
but
lavendar
knew
better
in
their
concern
and
sorrow
the
young
couple
had
forgotten
all
minor
matters
such
as
meals
and
luncheon
had
long
been
over
when
they
reached
the
house
they
could
see
de
tracy
figure
in
the
drawing
room
as
they
passed
the
windows
occupying
exactly
her
usual
seat
in
her
usual
attitude
it
was
her
hour
for
reading
and
disapproving
of
the
daily
paper
robinette
and
lavendar
entered
quietly
but
nothing
in
the
gravity
of
their
faces
struck
de
tracy
as
strange
i
have
a
disturbing
piece
of
news
to
give
you
mark
began
clearing
his
throat
prettyman
died
last
night
in
her
cottage
at
wittisham
the
erect
figure
in
the
widow
weeds
remained
motionless
perhaps
the
old
hand
that
lowered
the
newspaper
trembled
somewhat
so
that
its
diamonds
quivered
a
little
more
than
usual
so
prettyman
is
dead
she
said
then
as
the
young
people
stood
looking
at
her
with
an
air
of
some
expectancy
she
added
with
a
sour
glance
do
you
expect
me
to
be
very
much
agitated
by
the
news
the
death
was
unexpected
began
lavendar
lamely
she
was
my
age
said
de
tracy
with
a
wintry
smile
is
death
at
so
unexpected
an
event
lavendar
said
nothing
he
had
nothing
to
say
and
robinette
for
the
same
reason
was
silent
she
was
gazing
at
her
aunt
almost
unconsciously
with
a
wondering
look
at
any
rate
continued
de
tracy
addressing
her
niece
your
has
been
fortunate
in
two
ways
robinette
she
will
neither
be
turned
out
of
her
cottage
nor
see
the
destruction
of
her
plum
tree
by
the
way
with
a
perfectly
natural
change
of
tone
dismissing
at
once
both
prettyman
and
death
the
plum
tree
down
i
suppose
you
saw
it
very
much
down
answered
lavendar
and
certainly
we
saw
it
carnaby
does
nothing
by
halves
a
slight
change
a
kind
of
shade
of
softening
passed
over
de
tracy
stern
features
as
the
shadow
of
a
summer
cloud
may
pass
over
a
rocky
hill
she
turned
suddenly
to
robinette
can
you
tell
me
on
your
word
of
honour
that
you
had
nothing
to
do
with
carnaby
action
that
you
did
not
put
it
into
his
head
to
cut
the
plum
tree
down
i
exclaimed
robinette
scarlet
with
indignation
why
do
you
want
to
know
what
i
think
of
the
action
i
think
it
was
perfectly
brutal
and
the
boy
who
did
it
next
door
to
a
criminal
there
de
tracy
seemed
convinced
by
the
energy
of
this
disclaimer
i
have
always
considered
yours
a
very
candid
character
she
observed
with
condescension
i
believe
you
when
you
say
that
you
did
not
influence
carnaby
in
the
matter
though
i
strongly
suspected
you
before
well
upon
my
word
ejaculated
robinette
when
they
had
got
out
of
the
room
too
completely
baffled
to
be
more
original
what
does
she
mean
has
any
one
ever
understood
the
workings
of
aunt
de
mind
do
come
to
me
for
any
more
explanations
i
done
my
best
for
my
client
cried
lavendar
i
give
up
my
brief
i
always
told
you
de
tracy
character
was
entirely
singular
let
us
hope
so
commented
robinette
with
energy
i
should
be
sorry
for
the
world
if
it
were
plural
carnaby
was
not
in
the
house
and
lavendar
proceeded
to
look
for
him
out
of
doors
he
knew
the
boy
was
often
to
be
found
in
a
high
part
of
the
grounds
behind
the
garden
where
he
had
some
special
resort
of
his
own
and
he
went
there
first
the
afternoon
had
clouded
over
and
a
slight
shower
was
falling
as
mark
followed
the
wooded
path
leading
up
hill
a
bordered
it
where
ferns
and
flowers
were
growing
each
one
of
which
seemed
to
be
contributing
some
special
and
delicate
fragrance
to
the
damp
warm
air
the
beech
trees
here
had
low
and
spreading
branches
which
framed
now
and
again
exquisite
glimpses
of
the
river
far
below
and
the
wooded
hills
beyond
it
lavendar
had
not
gone
far
when
he
found
carnaby
carnaby
intensely
perturbed
walking
up
and
down
by
himself
you
do
need
to
tell
me
said
the
boy
with
a
quick
and
agitated
gesture
of
the
hand
bates
told
me
old
prettyman
dead
his
merry
face
was
changed
and
looked
actually
haggard
and
his
eyes
searched
lavendar
with
an
expression
oddly
different
from
their
usual
fearless
and
straightforward
one
they
seemed
afraid
was
it
my
grandmother
was
it
our
fault
he
asked
i
i
feel
like
a
murderer
upon
my
soul
i
do
do
encourage
morbid
ideas
my
dear
fellow
said
lavendar
in
a
tone
there
trouble
enough
in
the
world
without
foolish
exaggeration
prettyman
was
as
she
often
said
to
your
cousin
a
very
feeble
old
woman
whose
time
had
come
the
doctor
certificate
will
tell
you
how
rheumatism
had
affected
her
heart
and
the
neighbours
would
very
soon
set
your
mind
at
rest
by
describing
the
number
of
times
poor
old
lizzie
had
nearly
died
before
think
of
it
though
said
carnaby
with
wondering
eyes
think
of
her
lying
dead
in
the
cottage
while
i
hacked
and
hewed
at
the
plum
tree
just
outside
by
jove
it
makes
a
fellow
feel
queer
he
shuddered
the
picture
he
evoked
was
certainly
a
strange
one
enough
a
strange
picture
in
the
moonlight
of
a
night
in
spring
the
doomed
beauty
of
the
blossoming
tree
the
blind
headstrong
human
energy
working
for
its
destruction
and
death
over
all
stealthy
and
strong
what
an
ass
i
was
said
carnaby
summing
up
the
situation
in
the
only
language
in
which
he
could
express
himself
sweating
and
stewing
and
hacking
away
thinking
myself
so
awfully
clever
and
all
the
time
things
things
were
being
arranged
in
quite
a
different
manner
we
are
often
made
to
feel
our
insignificance
in
ways
like
this
said
lavendar
we
are
very
small
atoms
carnaby
in
the
path
of
the
great
forces
that
sweep
us
on
i
should
rather
think
so
assented
the
wondering
boy
and
yet
can
a
fellow
sit
tight
all
the
time
and
just
wait
till
things
happen
ask
me
something
else
suggested
lavendar
ironically
there
was
a
short
pause
i
awfully
sorry
old
dead
carnaby
said
in
a
very
subdued
tone
i
meant
to
do
a
lot
for
her
to
try
and
make
up
for
my
grandmother
being
such
a
beast
he
stopped
short
and
to
lavendar
astonishment
his
face
worked
and
two
tears
squeezed
themselves
out
of
his
eyes
and
rolled
over
his
round
cheeks
as
they
might
have
done
over
a
baby
it
the
i
was
thinking
of
he
sniffed
once
a
pal
of
mine
and
i
were
playing
the
fool
in
old
prettyman
garden
pretending
to
steal
the
plums
and
giving
her
duck
bits
of
bread
steeped
in
beer
to
make
it
a
duck
can
be
just
as
drunk
as
a
chap
she
did
mind
a
bit
she
was
a
regular
old
brick
and
gave
us
a
jolly
good
tea
and
a
pot
of
jam
to
take
away
and
now
she
dead
and
and
feelings
became
too
much
for
him
again
and
a
handkerchief
that
had
seen
better
and
much
cleaner
days
came
into
play
lavendar
flung
an
arm
round
the
boy
shoulder
this
kind
of
regret
comes
to
us
all
carnaby
he
said
i
suppose
there
a
man
with
a
heart
in
his
breast
who
has
sometime
had
to
say
to
himself
i
might
have
done
better
i
might
have
been
kinder
it
too
late
now
but
it
never
too
late
added
lavendar
under
his
breath
not
where
love
is
the
shower
was
over
and
though
the
sun
had
not
come
out
a
pleasant
light
lay
upon
the
river
as
the
friends
walked
down
upon
the
river
beyond
which
old
lizzie
prettyman
was
sleeping
so
peacefully
the
sleep
of
kings
and
beggars
and
just
and
unjust
and
rich
and
poor
alike
carnaby
had
dried
his
eyes
but
continued
in
a
pensive
mood
cousin
robin
still
angry
with
me
about
the
tree
he
said
uncertainly
she
wo
be
angry
long
lavendar
assured
him
you
and
your
cousin
robin
are
going
to
be
firm
friends
friends
for
life
carnaby
seemed
a
good
deal
comforted
mind
you
do
tell
her
i
blubbered
he
said
in
sudden
alarm
swear
she
would
think
a
bit
the
worse
of
you
for
that
said
lavendar
swear
though
repeated
carnaby
in
deadly
earnest
and
lavendar
swore
of
course
but
an
influence
very
unlike
lavendar
and
a
spirit
very
different
from
robinette
enfolded
carnaby
de
tracy
in
his
home
and
fought
as
it
were
for
his
soul
that
night
after
the
last
lamp
had
been
put
out
by
the
careful
bates
and
after
benson
had
bade
a
respectful
to
her
mistress
a
light
still
burned
in
de
room
presently
carried
in
her
hand
it
flitted
out
along
the
silent
passages
past
rows
of
doors
which
were
closed
upon
empty
rooms
or
upon
unconscious
sleepers
till
it
came
to
carnaby
door
to
the
boys
room
as
that
and
most
unluxurious
apartment
had
always
been
called
de
tracy
was
making
a
pilgrimage
to
the
shrine
of
one
of
her
gods
she
opened
the
door
and
closing
it
gently
behind
her
she
stood
beside
carnaby
bed
and
looked
at
him
intently
and
haggardly
de
tracy
was
a
singular
character
as
mark
lavendar
had
said
the
circumstances
of
her
widowhood
with
its
heavy
responsibilities
had
perhaps
hardly
been
fair
to
her
there
had
been
little
room
for
the
kindlier
and
softer
feelings
though
it
is
to
be
feared
that
they
would
not
have
found
much
congenial
soil
in
her
heart
the
personal
selfishness
in
her
had
long
been
merged
in
the
greater
and
harder
selfishness
of
caste
she
had
become
a
mere
machine
for
the
keeping
up
of
stoke
revel
but
she
was
moved
by
the
positively
human
sentiment
which
had
been
stirred
in
her
by
carnaby
startling
act
of
cutting
the
plum
tree
down
ah
let
fools
believe
if
they
could
that
she
was
angry
with
the
boy
she
had
never
felt
anger
less
or
pride
more
while
others
talked
and
argued
made
love
muddled
and
made
mistakes
her
grandson
the
man
of
the
race
that
always
ruled
had
cut
the
knot
for
himself
without
hesitation
and
without
compunction
without
consulting
anyone
or
asking
anyone
leave
that
was
the
way
the
de
tracys
had
always
acted
and
it
seemed
to
de
tracy
a
crowning
coincidence
a
fitting
kind
of
poetical
justice
that
carnaby
action
should
actually
have
prevented
the
sale
of
the
land
that
dreaded
detestable
sale
of
the
first
land
that
the
de
tracys
had
held
upon
the
banks
of
the
river
so
since
carnaby
was
to
be
a
man
of
the
right
kind
his
grandmother
had
come
to
look
at
him
not
in
love
as
other
women
come
to
such
bedsides
but
in
pride
of
heart
the
boy
after
his
white
night
at
wittisham
and
the
varied
emotions
of
the
succeeding
day
lay
on
his
side
in
the
deep
recuperative
sleep
of
youth
whence
its
energies
are
drawn
and
in
which
its
vigors
are
renewed
his
round
cheek
indented
the
pillow
his
rumpled
hair
stirred
in
the
breeze
that
blew
in
at
the
window
his
arm
and
his
open
hand
relaxed
lay
along
the
sheet
another
woman
would
have
straightened
the
above
him
another
might
have
touched
his
hair
or
hand
another
kissed
his
cheek
but
not
even
because
he
was
like
her
departed
husband
like
the
man
who
five
and
fifty
years
before
had
courted
a
certain
cold
and
proud
handsome
and
penniless
miss
augusta
gallup
would
de
tracy
do
these
things
she
had
had
her
sensation
such
as
it
was
her
secret
moment
of
emotion
and
was
satisfied
she
left
the
room
as
she
had
come
the
candle
casting
exaggerated
shadows
of
herself
upon
the
walls
where
carnaby
bats
and
fishing
rods
and
sporting
prints
hung
it
is
sad
to
be
old
as
de
tracy
was
old
but
her
age
was
of
her
own
making
a
shrinkage
of
the
heart
a
drying
up
of
the
wells
of
feeling
that
need
not
have
been
i
should
be
better
out
of
the
way
her
bitterness
said
within
her
and
alas
it
was
true
her
great
gaunt
room
seemed
very
lonely
very
full
of
shadows
when
she
returned
to
it
rupert
who
always
slept
at
her
bedside
awaited
her
disturbed
at
this
unwonted
hour
he
stirred
in
his
basket
wheezed
and
gurgled
turned
round
and
round
and
could
not
get
comfortable
whined
and
looked
up
in
his
mistress
face
she
stood
watching
him
with
a
sort
of
grim
pity
and
strangely
enough
bestowed
upon
him
the
caress
she
had
not
found
for
her
grandson
poor
rupert
you
are
getting
too
old
like
your
mistress
your
departure
like
hers
will
be
a
sorrow
to
no
one
rupert
seemed
to
wheeze
an
asthmatical
consent
and
presently
he
snuggled
down
in
his
basket
and
went
to
sleep
xxv
the
bells
of
stoke
revel
on
sunday
morning
robinette
and
lavendar
were
both
ready
for
church
by
some
strange
coincidence
half
an
hour
too
soon
he
was
standing
at
the
door
as
she
came
down
into
the
hall
de
tracy
and
miss
smeardon
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
even
carnaby
was
invisible
but
the
shrill
infuriated
yelping
of
the
prince
charles
from
the
drawing
room
indicated
his
whereabouts
only
too
plainly
we
much
too
early
said
robinette
glancing
at
the
clock
shall
we
walk
through
the
buttercup
meadow
then
you
and
i
asked
lavendar
his
voice
was
low
and
robinette
answered
very
softly
she
wore
a
white
dress
that
morning
without
a
touch
of
colour
i
could
wear
black
for
nurse
she
said
in
answer
to
his
glance
but
i
could
wear
any
colour
either
you
as
white
as
the
plum
tree
was
said
lavendar
i
remember
thinking
that
it
looked
like
a
bride
robinette
made
no
reply
he
ventured
to
look
up
at
her
as
he
spoke
and
she
was
smiling
although
her
lip
quivered
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
tears
lavendar
heart
beat
uncomfortably
fast
as
they
walked
through
the
meadow
towards
the
stile
which
led
into
the
churchyard
it
too
soon
to
go
in
yet
he
said
the
bells
have
begun
let
stop
here
it
cool
in
the
shadow
said
robinette
she
leaned
on
the
wall
and
looked
out
at
the
shining
reaches
of
the
river
the
swelling
of
jordan
is
over
now
she
said
with
a
little
smile
and
a
sigh
the
tide
has
come
up
and
how
quiet
everything
is
the
water
mirrored
the
hills
and
the
ships
and
the
gracious
sky
above
them
there
was
scarcely
a
sound
in
the
air
at
the
point
where
they
stood
the
manor
house
was
hidden
from
view
and
only
the
squat
old
tower
of
the
church
was
visible
and
the
yew
tree
rising
above
the
wall
against
the
golden
field
a
bush
of
briar
covered
with
white
roses
hung
above
them
just
behind
robinette
and
lavendar
looking
at
her
in
this
english
setting
on
an
english
sunday
morning
wondered
to
himself
as
he
had
so
often
done
before
if
she
could
ever
make
this
country
her
home
yet
she
has
english
blood
as
well
as
i
he
thought
why
the
very
name
on
the
old
bells
of
the
church
there
records
the
memory
of
an
ancestress
of
hers
we
can
not
be
so
far
apart
looking
at
her
standing
there
he
rehearsed
to
himself
all
that
he
meant
to
say
oh
a
great
many
things
both
true
and
eloquent
but
at
that
moment
every
word
forsook
him
yet
this
was
probably
the
best
opportunity
he
would
have
of
telling
her
what
was
burning
in
his
heart
telling
her
how
she
had
beguiled
him
at
first
by
her
quick
understanding
and
her
frolicsome
wit
because
all
that
sort
of
thing
was
so
new
to
him
she
had
come
like
a
mountain
spring
to
a
thirsty
man
he
had
been
groping
for
inspiration
and
for
help
now
he
seemed
to
find
them
all
in
her
she
was
so
much
more
than
charming
though
it
was
her
charm
that
first
impressed
him
so
much
more
than
pretty
though
her
face
attracted
him
at
first
so
much
more
than
magnetic
though
she
drew
him
to
her
at
their
first
meeting
with
bonds
as
delicate
as
they
were
strong
these
were
tangible
vital
legitimate
qualities
but
were
they
all
could
lips
part
so
could
eyes
shine
so
could
voice
tremble
so
if
there
were
not
something
underneath
a
good
heart
fidelity
warmth
of
nature
for
the
first
time
he
thought
i
long
to
be
worthy
of
a
woman
but
i
would
not
tell
her
how
i
love
her
at
this
moment
unless
i
felt
i
need
not
be
wholly
unequal
to
her
demands
i
have
never
desired
anything
strongly
enough
to
struggle
for
it
up
to
now
but
she
has
set
my
springs
in
motion
and
i
can
work
for
her
until
i
die
all
this
he
thought
but
never
a
word
he
said
then
the
church
clock
struck
and
the
clashing
bells
began
they
shook
the
air
the
earth
the
ancient
stones
the
very
nests
upon
the
trees
and
sent
the
rooks
flying
black
as
ink
against
the
yellow
buttercups
in
the
meadow
we
must
go
in
a
few
minutes
said
robinette
oh
will
you
pull
me
some
of
those
white
roses
up
there
lavendar
swung
himself
up
and
drawing
down
a
bunch
he
pulled
off
two
white
buds
will
you
take
them
he
asked
holding
them
out
to
her
then
suddenly
he
said
very
low
and
very
humbly
oh
take
me
too
take
me
robinette
though
no
man
was
ever
so
unworthy
robinette
laid
the
roses
on
the
wall
beside
her
for
my
part
she
said
turning
to
lavendar
with
a
little
laugh
that
was
half
a
sob
for
my
part
i
like
giving
better
than
taking
she
put
both
her
hands
in
his
and
looked
into
his
face
here
is
my
life
she
said
simply
i
want
to
belong
to
you
to
help
you
to
live
by
your
side
i
ought
to
take
you
at
your
word
he
said
his
voice
choked
with
emotion
you
are
far
too
good
for
me
hush
robinetta
answered
putting
a
finger
on
his
lip
it
is
a
question
of
how
great
you
are
or
how
wonderful
it
a
question
of
what
we
can
be
to
each
other
i
rather
have
you
than
the
duke
of
wellington
or
marcus
aurelius
and
i
believe
you
would
change
me
for
helen
of
troy
i
have
nothing
to
bring
you
nothing
said
lavendar
again
nothing
but
my
love
and
my
whole
heart
if
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
earth
were
offered
to
me
instead
i
would
still
take
you
and
what
you
give
me
robinette
answered
lavendar
laid
his
cheek
against
her
bright
hair
and
sighed
deeply
in
that
sigh
there
passed
away
all
former
things

behold
all
things
