now
ol

d
y
see
it
anywhar
the
girl
and
the
big
shaggy
dog
stood
side
by
side
on
the
narrow
pebbly
strip
of
beach
and
gazed
intently
at
the
whirling
seething
water
where
a
breaker
of
unusual
size
had
crashed
high
sending
these
two
for
a
moment
scrambling
up
the
rocks
back
of
them
towered
an
almost
perpendicular
cliff
on
top
of
which
stood
the
windy
island
lighthouse
severe
in
outline
but
glaring
red
and
white
in
color
that
it
might
be
readily
observed
in
the
daytime
by
pilots
who
were
strangers
in
those
dangerous
waters
many
a
shoal
there
was
under
the
tossing
turbulent
waves
unsuspected
by
the
unwary
mariner
and
in
the
heavy
fogs
that
often
hung
like
wet
impenetrable
blankets
over
that
part
of
the
new
england
coast
many
a
vessel
would
have
crashed
to
its
destruction
had
it
not
been
for
the
faithful
captain
ezra
bassett
who
had
been
keeper
of
the
light
since
rilla
was
a
baby
the
dog
s
sight
must
have
been
keener
than
that
of
the
girl
for
a
moment
later
he
dashed
away
up
the
narrow
strip
of
beach
and
began
to
bark
furiously
at
some
object
that
was
tossing
on
an
incoming
wave
the
girl
raced
after
him
her
hazel
eyes
glowing
with
excitement
her
long
brown
hair
with
a
glint
of
red
in
it
unfastened
flying
back
of
her
tain
t
the
same
thing
shagsie
she
shouted
to
her
companion
tain
t
what
yo
was
tryin
to
fetch
ashore
down
below
by
the
rocks
is
more
like
a
box
or
suthin
the
eager
expression
in
the
girl
s
big
starlike
eyes
changed
to
one
of
concern
and
anxiety
shags
she
cried
thar
s
been
a
wreck
that
s
sure
sartin
but
twa
n
t
hereabouts
pears
she
shaded
her
eyes
with
one
hand
and
gazed
searchingly
out
toward
the
horizon
but
in
another
moment
her
eager
interest
returned
to
the
box
look
yo
ol
dog
it
s
ridin
high
we
ll
get
it
yo
see
if
we
don
t
here
she
comes
heave
ahead
now
shagsie
the
dog
raced
around
barking
wildly
but
the
barefooted
girl
plunged
deep
into
the
seething
foam
caught
a
banded
box
of
foreign
appearance
and
held
on
with
all
her
strength
while
the
undertow
tried
to
drag
her
treasure
away
but
the
wave
receded
and
the
box
was
left
high
we
got
it
ol
shags
we
got
it
she
cried
triumphantly
tossing
back
her
hair
for
when
she
had
stooped
it
had
fallen
about
her
face
this
hindered
the
freedom
of
her
movements
and
so
snatching
up
a
wet
green
ribbon
of
seaweed
she
tied
her
hair
back
with
it
another
wave
was
rushing
roaring
shoreward
one
quick
seaward
glance
told
her
that
it
was
going
to
be
the
biggest
one
yet
could
she
get
the
box
high
enough
to
be
out
of
reach
of
that
next
breaker
how
she
tugged
but
her
efforts
were
fruitless
for
with
a
deafening
thud
the
wave
crashed
over
her
lifting
the
box
to
which
she
still
clung
and
hurling
them
both
farther
up
the
beach
the
girl
was
drenched
but
exultant
and
miraculously
unhurt
we
ve
got
it
now
sure
sartin
shags
ol
flushed
and
breathless
she
sank
down
on
the
banded
box
for
a
moment
to
rest
but
the
dog
sniffing
at
it
barked
his
excitement
yo
d
like
to
know
what
s
in
it
would
yo
queried
the
laughing
girl
well
sir
so
would
i
but
like
as
not
we
d
better
get
it
into
treasure
cave
fore
we
open
it
like
as
not
we
d
as
the
girl
spoke
she
glanced
up
at
the
lighthouse
towering
above
her
s
still
asleep
i
reckon
but
twa
n
t
be
long
now
afore
he
s
wakin
so
we
d
better
heave
to
and
hist
rilla
had
found
a
leather
handle
on
one
end
of
the
box
and
holding
fast
to
this
slowly
and
with
great
effort
she
began
dragging
it
up
the
rocks
and
about
half
an
hour
later
as
a
reward
for
her
perseverence
she
disappeared
with
it
into
a
small
opening
in
the
cliff
and
not
a
moment
too
soon
for
a
stentorian
voice
high
above
her
called
rilly
gal
where
be
yo
don
yo
know
as
it
s
past
time
for
mess
yeah
we
was
just
which
was
the
truth
for
having
safely
hidden
the
box
in
her
treasure
cave
the
girl
had
suddenly
thought
that
she
must
go
at
once
and
prepare
her
grandfather
s
evening
meal
shagsie
she
confided
ol
dog
we
ll
have
to
wait
over
till
tomorrer
to
know
what
s
in
it
we
ll
come
an
look
as
soon
as
its
how
i
hope
it
s
suthin
wonderful
when
muriel
storm
entered
the
kitchen
of
the
small
house
adjoining
the
light
her
grandfather
gazed
at
her
keenly
from
under
his
shaggy
grey
brows
a
severe
unforgiving
man
some
folks
called
him
but
he
hadn
t
looked
long
at
the
darling
of
his
heart
before
his
expression
changed
softened
until
those
grey
eyes
that
had
often
struck
terror
to
an
offending
deckhand
shone
with
a
light
that
was
infinitely
tender
well
rilly
gal
fust
mate
of
the
lighthouse
craft
i
cal
late
ye
ve
been
workin
purty
hard
this
past
hour
doin
nothin
pears
like
yer
purty
het
up
lookin
the
girl
made
no
reply
though
she
laughed
over
her
shoulder
at
the
old
man
who
with
his
cap
pushed
back
sat
by
the
stove
in
his
wooden
armchair
smoking
his
corncob
pipe
in
solid
comfort
this
was
the
hour
that
he
liked
best
when
his
gal
was
cooking
his
evening
meal
and
chattering
to
him
of
this
and
him
how
the
lame
pelican
that
had
been
away
for
a
week
had
returned
but
not
alone
for
a
beautiful
pelican
that
wasn
t
lame
at
all
had
been
with
him
or
when
she
wasn
t
chattering
she
was
singing
songs
in
her
sweet
untrained
voice
while
she
fried
the
fish
and
potatoes
but
tonight
the
old
captain
noted
that
the
girl
was
unusually
silent
that
her
cheeks
were
almost
feverishly
red
and
there
was
a
sudden
clutching
dread
in
his
heart
just
so
had
the
other
rilly
this
girl
s
mother
looked
and
acted
the
day
before
she
ran
away
and
married
the
young
man
from
the
city
the
eyes
under
the
shaggy
grey
brows
were
hard
again
and
rilla
noting
in
the
face
of
the
she
so
loved
the
expression
she
dreaded
ran
to
him
fork
in
hand
and
pressing
her
cheek
against
his
forehead
she
cried
oh
what
set
yo
thinkin
o
that
yo
know
i
wouldn
t
be
leavin
yo
i
love
yo
i
ll
allays
allays
stay
an
be
yer
fust
clear
to
the
end
of
the
v
yage
take
an
oath
to
it
rilly
it
might
have
seemed
ludicrous
to
an
onlooker
but
there
was
no
one
to
see
as
the
girl
with
an
earnest
almost
inspired
expression
on
her
truly
beautiful
face
stood
up
and
lifting
her
hand
seemingly
unconscious
that
it
held
a
fork
said
in
a
voice
ringing
with
sincerity
i
call
god
to
witness
that
i
ll
never
go
away
from
yo
without
yer
permittin
then
there
was
one
of
those
sudden
changes
that
made
rilla
so
irresistable
she
cried
teasingly
as
she
stooped
and
looked
with
laughing
eyes
directly
into
the
grey
ones
that
were
softening
again
i
m
only
sixteen
come
next
month
and
why
tis
yo
worry
so
bout
my
marryin
sartin
is
puzzlin
i
don
t
even
know
a
boy
ceptin
sol
dexter
s
buddy
and
he
s
not
as
high
as
one
of
the
barrels
in
his
ma
s
yer
heavin
oil
on
troubled
waters
and
the
sea
s
smoothin
down
the
old
captain
said
as
he
drew
his
chair
up
to
the
table
and
took
up
his
knife
and
fork
preparatory
to
eating
the
good
supper
that
rilla
had
placed
before
him
but
instead
of
beginning
he
remarked
i
can
t
figger
out
why
i
keep
thinkin
of
city
fellers
this
week
past
they
don
t
any
of
em
come
to
tunkett
at
this
time
o
the
year
that
thar
summer
hotel
at
the
pint
is
closed
as
tight
as
a
clam
that
can
t
be
opened
without
smashin
it
an
so
are
the
cottages
as
the
rich
folks
call
them
gray
shanties
they
loaf
around
in
every
summer
so
i
figger
yer
ol
must
be
gettin
when
the
supper
dishes
had
been
washed
and
put
away
rilla
found
her
grandfather
sitting
just
outside
the
door
smoking
his
beloved
corncob
pipe
and
watching
the
sunset
she
went
out
and
sat
on
a
wooden
stool
at
his
feet
rilla
loved
to
sit
quietly
with
folded
hands
while
the
glow
was
fading
in
the
west
and
dream
dreams
just
as
the
last
flush
was
paling
the
old
man
rose
time
to
put
the
light
on
rilly
gal
he
said
she
heard
his
heavy
steps
climbing
the
spiral
stairs
fainter
and
fainter
they
grew
and
then
a
moment
later
just
as
the
first
stars
glimmered
through
the
dusk
the
great
light
flashed
over
the
sea
and
began
slowly
turning
for
the
lighthouse
was
on
an
island
one
mile
from
shore
and
the
waters
all
about
it
were
illumined
for
a
moment
rilla
saw
a
fishing
boat
that
was
nearly
becalmed
and
would
have
trouble
reaching
port
that
night
it
s
ol
cap
n
barney
like
s
not
he
s
allays
late
gettin
the
girl
rose
and
went
indoors
shags
who
had
been
lying
silently
at
her
feet
accompanied
her
she
said
standing
on
tiptoe
to
kiss
the
old
man
who
stood
erect
in
spite
of
his
many
years
then
almost
shyly
she
added
when
i
come
sixteen
yer
goin
to
tell
me
all
about
it
like
yo
promised
aren
t
yo
a
grunt
which
could
hardly
be
interpreted
in
the
affirmative
was
the
only
reply
and
yet
neither
had
it
been
negative
kissing
him
again
rilla
went
to
her
snug
little
room
over
the
kitchen
and
shags
followed
for
he
always
slept
just
outside
her
closed
door
rilla
did
not
light
the
kerosene
lamp
that
stood
on
the
small
table
the
moon
was
rising
and
she
liked
its
light
best
for
a
moment
she
stood
at
the
open
window
facing
the
town
which
in
the
fall
and
winter
was
so
dark
and
quiet
in
the
evening
but
in
summer
when
the
city
people
were
in
their
cabins
on
the
point
it
was
pulsing
with
life
color
and
music
rilla
never
visited
the
town
in
summer
she
was
then
practically
a
prisoner
on
the
small
rocky
island
for
a
long
time
she
stood
watching
the
waves
that
lifted
silvery
crests
in
the
moonlight
i
wonder
who
my
dad
was
she
thought
as
she
had
many
times
before
i
wonder
why
he
never
came
for
me
after
my
forgotten
was
the
box
in
treasure
cave
many
had
been
the
moods
of
rilla
that
day
but
when
she
had
undressed
in
the
moonlight
she
knelt
not
by
the
bedside
but
facing
the
window
looking
up
toward
the
peaceful
starry
sky
she
whispered
softly
god
in
heaven
bless
my
my
never
came
for
me
soon
she
was
asleep
little
dreaming
that
the
next
day
was
to
bring
into
her
hitherto
quiet
and
uneventful
life
her
first
real
adventure
chapter
ii
a
gift
from
the
sea
sunrise
and
the
memory
of
the
treasure
box
came
at
the
same
time
rilla
was
dressed
in
a
twinkling
she
did
not
even
stop
to
peer
into
the
bit
of
broken
mirror
which
sol
dexter
had
given
her
hoping
that
with
it
would
go
the
proverbial
seven
years
of
bad
luck
sol
dexter
kept
the
general
store
and
postoffice
in
the
fishing
village
of
tunkett
she
was
absolutely
honest
was
sol
but
not
inclined
to
be
generous
if
the
scales
tipped
one
cranberry
too
many
out
came
that
cranberry
she
had
never
before
been
known
to
give
anything
away
but
something
which
might
bring
bad
luck
she
had
been
willing
to
part
with
it
had
been
a
happy
day
for
rilla
that
one
when
for
the
first
time
she
had
acquired
a
real
mirror
it
was
of
course
after
the
summer
season
or
she
would
not
have
been
in
town
at
all
and
on
that
same
day
her
had
given
her
a
whole
quarter
to
spend
just
as
she
wished
and
she
had
asked
sol
dexter
for
two
hair
ribbons
one
to
match
the
sunrise
and
one
like
the
green
in
the
hollow
of
a
wave
just
before
it
turns
over
when
the
sun
is
shining
on
it
queerest
gal
that
dexter
confided
to
her
husband
cap
n
sol
the
next
time
he
came
in
from
one
of
his
sea
v
she
must
get
all
them
sunset
notions
from
her
pa
s
side
i
recollect
hearin
he
was
an
artist
wall
the
man
had
replied
if
that
pore
gal
gets
any
comfort
out
n
em
i
m
sure
sartin
glad
she
s
little
more
n
a
prisoner
most
o

island
jest
because
her
ma
ran
off

cal
late
them
thar

fellars
on
the
whole
ain
t
hankerin
to
splice
up
with

keepers

nor
when
rilla
had
reached
home
that
day
when
she
had
purchased
something
all
by
herself
and
for
the
very
first
time
she
had
slipped
up
to
her
room
with
the
broken
mirror
and
she
had
tied
on
both
of
the
new
hair
ribbons
one
red
and
one
green
they
weren
t
the
shades
that
she
had
really
wanted
but
they
were
the
prettiest
that
sol
dexter
had
in
stock
then
she
gazed
long
at
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
had
told
her
that
she
was
the
splittin
image
of
her
mother
who
had
died
when
she
was
only
seventeen
i
ve
allays

there
was
always
a
wistful
yearning
expression
in
the
hazel
eyes
of
the
girl
when
she
thought
of
her
mother
but
all
this
had
happened
the
autumn
before
bad
luck
had
befallen
didn
t
even
know
that
a
broken
mirror
was
supposed
to
bring
bad
that
is
probably
why
it
had
not
done
so
for
we
get
in
this
world
what
we
expect
very
often
and
this
little
lass
who
lived
so
close
to
nature
was
always
expecting
something
wonderful
to
happen
and
she
found
real
joy
in
the
simplest
things
the
dog
lying
just
outside
the
door
lifted
a
listening
ear
the
moment
his
little
mistress
had
stepped
out
of
bed
and
he
was
eagerly
waiting
when
she
softly
opened
the
door
sh
shagsie
ol
dog
don
be
barkin
the
girl
cautioned
s
put
the
light
out
an
he
s
gone
back
to
his
bunk
for
nother
forty
winks
you
n
i
ll
have
time
to
see
what
s
in
the
box
soft
now
the
dog
s
intelligent
brown
eyes
were
watching
the
face
of
his
mistress
and
he
seemed
to
understand
that
he
must
be
very
quiet
if
muriel
tiptoed
as
she
went
down
the
curving
flight
of
steps
to
the
kitchen
so
too
did
shags
as
she
passed
the
door
of
her
s
bedroom
she
could
hear
his
even
breathing
it
was
not
unusual
for
rilla
and
shags
to
climb
to
the
top
of
the
crags
to
watch
the
sunrise
and
so
even
if
her
grandfather
had
awakened
he
would
have
thought
nothing
of
it
but
it
was
not
to
the
highest
point
of
the
cliff
that
the
girl
went
instead
she
clambered
down
what
appeared
to
be
a
perilous
descent
but
both
she
and
the
dog
were
as
as
mountain
goats
and
they
were
soon
standing
on
the
ledge
in
front
of
a
small
opening
which
was
the
entrance
to
her
treasure
cave
eager
as
the
girl
was
to
learn
the
secret
that
the
box
contained
she
did
not
go
in
at
once
but
paused
turning
toward
the
sea
the
waves
lifting
snowy
crests
caught
the
dawning
glory
of
the
sky
impulsively
she
stretched
her
arms
out
to
the
sun
there
was
something
sacred
to
this
untaught
girl
about
the
rebirth
of
each
day
and
the
glory
of
the
sky
and
sea
was
reflected
in
her
radiant
upturned
face
only
for
a
brief
while
did
the
pageantry
last
and
the
s
world
all
that
she
again
attired
in
its
everyday
garb
while
over
all
was
the
shining
stooping
for
the
cave
door
was
too
small
to
be
entered
by
so
tall
a
girl
were
she
standing
erect
rilla
disappeared
from
the
ledge
and
shags
followed
her
the
cave
within
was
larger
than
one
might
suppose
and
was
lighted
by
wide
crevices
here
and
there
in
its
wall
of
rocks
through
which
rays
of
sunlight
slanted
the
continuous
roar
of
the
surf
crashing
on
the
rocks
below
was
somewhat
dulled
rilla
leaped
forward
with
a
little
cry
of

night

she
clapped
her
hands
for
there
were
moments
when
rilla
was
a
very
little
girl
at
heart
much
younger
than
her
years
and
yet
at
other
times
when
she
was
comforting
her
old
and
soothing
away
his
imaginary
fears
she
was
far
older
than
fifteen
shags
was
now
permitted
to
bark
his
excitement
which
he
did
capering
in
puppy
fashion
about
the
banded
box
of
foreign
appearance
the
girl
looked
at
it
with
her
head
on
one
side
how
in
time
are
we
to
get
into
it

inquired

to

as
the

spoke
she
lifted
the
cover
of
the
box
and
uttered
a
cry
of
mingled
joy
and
amazement
thunder

she
ejaculated
unconsciously
using
both
of
her

favorite
exclamations

up

as

as
the
girl
talked
to
her
interested
companion
she
lifted
the
cover
and
placed
it
against
the
wall
of
the
cave
meanwhile
the
curious
dog
was
dragging
something
from
the
box
rilla
leaped
forward
to
rescue
whatever
it
might
be

she
commanded

o
this
after
rescuing
the
mysterious
something
which
the
dog
had
evidently
considered
his
rightful
share
of
the
booty
the
girl
knelt
and
examined
the
contents
of
the
box
she
then
turned
glowing
eyes
toward
her
comrade
who
had
minded
her
and
was
watching
her
intently
his
head
low
on
his
outstretched
paws

she
ejaculated

to

her

rilla
lifted
a
truly
wonderful
garment
from
the
was
green
like
the
heart
of
a
wave
just
before
its
foamy

curls
over
in
the
sun
it
was
trimmed
with
silvery
spangly
lace
it

then
the

rang
out
as
she
drew
forth
another
treasure

she
chuckled
maybe

and
a

to

a
stockin
ol

now
who
she
paused
and
listened
intently
ringing
clear
above
the
booming
crash
of
the
surf
she
heard
her
calling
quickly
she
ran
to
the
opening
rilly

whar
be
you
never

be
around

time
lately
the
kettle

like

sailor
and

to

comin
the
girl
thrust
her
head
out
to
reply
in
a
quieter
moment
when
a
wave
was
receding
then
hastily
but
with
infinite
care
she
knelt
and
smoothed
the
silken
folds
of
the
shimmering
green
gown
replaced
the
top
strapped
it
down
and
then
covered
the
whole
with
an
old
sail
cloth
which
had
been
one
of
rilla
s
former
treasures
if
the
girl
had
been
excited
the
night
before
she
was
much
more
so
this
early
morning
however
her
was
preoccupied
and
did
not
notice
the
flushed
cheeks
and
eager
glowing
eyes
of
his
fust
silently
he
ate
his
quarter
of
apple
pie
gulped
down
a
huge
cup
of
steaming
coffee
it
was
plain
to
the
girl
who
watched
him
that
he
was
thinking
of
something
intently
rilla
was
counting
the
minutes
that
would
have
to
elapse
before
she
revisited
the
cave
when
her
pushed
his
armchair
back
from
the
table
and
arose

peered
over

spectacles
at

begging

the
dog
leaped
alongside
as
the
old
man
went
down
the
steep
wet
stairs
that
led
to
the
wharf
near
which
a
dory
was
floating
the
girl
stood
in
the
open
door
and
with
shaded
eyes
watched
the
scudding
sailboat
until
as
was
his
custom
her
turned
to
wave
to
her
as
he
passed
the
first
buoy
there
were
many
buoys
painted
in
varying
bright
colors
that
the
skipper
of
each
incoming
fishing
smack
might
have
no
trouble
in
locating
his
own
particular
mooring
place
on
a
moonlighted
night
when
the
sailing
boats
were
all
in
it
was
indeed
a
pretty
sight
to
see
the
flotilla
some
newly
painted
and
others
bobbing
on
the
choppy
waters
of
the
bay
windy
island
though
only
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
was
nearly
a
mile
long
and
protected
one
of
the
snuggest
little
harbors
to
be
found
along
that
wild
rugged
coast
as
soon
as
the
kitchen
was
shipshape

raced
toward

outer

of
the

rilla
did
not
enter
her
treasure
cave
again
that
day
for
in
another
moment
and
quite
unexpectedly
she
was
launched
upon
her
very
first
real
adventure
chapter
iii
a
first
adventure
muriel
did
not
have
to
call
a
second
time
to
her
shaggy
friend
for
up
the
steep
wet
steps
from
the
wharf
the
dog
leaped
and
lifted
intelligent
inquiring
eyes
don
let
s
go
to
the

off
the
girl
always
talked
to
her
companion
as
though
she
were

that

could
understand

whatever

mabbe
now
what
say
ol
shags
knowing
that
a
reply
was
expected
when
his
mistress
stooped
and
stroked
his
head
the
dog
yapped
eagerly
then
raced
alongside
of
the
barefooted
girl
who
followed
an
infrequently
used
trail
which
ambled
along
toward
the
north
end
of
the
island
where
the
beach
was
wildest
the
shore
however
could
not
be
seen
until
one
was
nearly
upon
it
when
it
came
within
the
vision
of
the
girl
she
stood
still
so
suddenly
that
shags
having
kept
on
was
several
lengths
ahead
before
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
alone
he
turned
back
inquiringly
sh
keep
still
the
girl
whispered
her
hazel
eyes
growing
darker
and
wider
as
she
gazed
almost
as
though
she
were
frightened
at
something
just
below
on
the
rocky
beach
what
she
saw
was
not
really
a
youth
dressed
in
white
flannels
who
appeared
to
be
but
little
older
than
rilla
was
standing
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
gazing
at
a
sailboat
in
which
he
had
evidently
just
landed
and
which
he
had
drawn
as
high
as
he
could
up
on
the
shore
he
turned
with
a
start
when
an
angry
voice
called
clear
out
go
away
we
don
want
any
landlubbers
here
the
lad
however
did
not
seem
to
be
in
the
least
intimidated
by
this
outburst
from
the
rocks
above
him
looking
up
he
actually
smiled
a
barefooted
girl
with
hair
blowing
in
the
wind
and
with
a
shaggy
yellow
and
white
dog
at
her
side
was
to
his
thought
a
picture
more
to
be
admired
than
feared
and
for
that
matter
eugene
beavers
himself
was
not
he
had
clear
grey
eyes
a
keen
thin
face
and
a
firmly
rounded
chin
indeed
gene
as
his
best
friends
called
him
was
not
only
a
good
looking
lad
but
one
whom
young
and
old
trusted
unquestioningly
but
with
rilla
one
thought
was
uppermost
one
of
those
terrible
creatures
so
dreaded
by
her
had
dared
to
land
on
her
very
own
island
there
could
be
no
mistake
that
he
was
city
folks
for
no
boy
living
on
the
coast
would
have
such
a
pale
face
nor
would
he
be
dressed
in
white
flannels
if
yo
don
board
yer
boat
an
ship
off
instanter
i
ll
send
shags
at
yo
i
will
rilla
was
wrathful
because
her
first
command
had
not
been
obeyed
at
this
the
lad
laughed
not
rudely
but
with
merry
good
nature
it
seemed
to
him
truly
humorous
that
this
barefooted
girl
should
be
ordering
him
out
to
sea
rilla
however
believed
that
he
was
laughing
at
her
stamping
her
foot
and
pointing
at
the
boy
her
eyes
flashing
she
cried
shags
at
him
ol
the
faithful
creature
plunged
down
the
rocky
trail
growling
as
fiercely
as
he
could
but
as
he
approached
the
youth
toward
whom
his
mistress
was
pointing
he
paused
uncertainly
the
smiling
lad
unafraid
was
holding
out
a
welcoming
hand
come
here
good
dog
he
said
coaxingly
shags
being
friendly
by
nature
and
not
in
the
least
understanding
the
present
need
for
ferocity
actually
wagged
his
tail
and
permitted
the
strange
boy
to
stroke
his
head
this
was
too
much
for
rilla
her
had
said
that
the
dog
would
protect
her
but
he
hadn
t
done
it
with
an
angry
half
sob
she
turned
and
scrambled
up
the
rocks
a
second
later
when
the
boy
looked
up
the
girl
was
not
to
be
seen
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
turned
back
to
converse
with
his
newly
acquired
companion
gene
dearly
loved
dogs
and
shags
had
instinctively
recognized
in
him
a
friend
but
not
so
rilla
she
was
convinced
that
all
boys
from
the
city
were
enemies
for
had
not
her
said
so
time
and
again
running
to
the
lighthouse
the
girl
seized
the
gun
that
stood
in
the
corner
and
raced
back
again
the
next
time
that
gene
beavers
looked
up
there
she
stood
with
a
gun
pointed
directly
at
him
now
ll
yo
take
orders
her
voice
rang
out
angrily
her
eyes
dark
with
excitement
now
ll
yo
put
out
to
sea
the
lad
looked
puzzled
and
then
troubled
for
the
first
time
he
was
conscious
that
this
stormy
girl
really
feared
him
and
yet
he
could
not
get
near
enough
to
explain
to
her
why
he
had
landed
on
windy
island
what
should
he
do
what
could
he
do
rilla
said
no
more
but
while
he
was
hesitating
there
was
a
sudden
report
and
a
bullet
whizzed
over
his
head
it
was
evidently
merely
a
choice
between
which
kind
of
an
end
to
his
life
he
preferred
pushing
the
boat
into
the
water
in
a
quiet
spot
he
leaped
in
and
shoved
off
however
he
had
not
gone
two
lengths
from
shore
when
he
heard
the
girl
shouting
lustily
come
back
here
yo
landlubber
don
yo
know
yer
boat
s
sinkin
tarnation
sakes
what
kind
o
an
old
hulk
yo
got
thar
the
gun
had
been
thrown
down
and
the
girl
scrambled
down
to
the
edge
of
the
beach
the
boat
having
left
the
shelter
of
the
rocks
was
caught
in
the
surf
seizing
the
oars
gene
let
the
sail
flap
as
he
tried
to
regain
the
land
the
leak
which
had
driven
him
to
shore
in
the
beginning
was
causing
the
boat
to
rapidly
fill
with
water
then
to
complete
his
feeling
of
helplessness
an
unusually
large
breaker
was
thundering
toward
him
jump
the
gunnel
quick
or
yo
ll
flounder
the
girl
commanded
the
lad
obeyed
leaping
into
the
swirling
water
which
was
nearly
chin
deep
he
swam
toward
the
shore
and
not
a
moment
too
soon
for
the
breaker
lifted
the
boat
high
and
crashed
it
to
splinters
on
the
rocky
point
the
boy
and
the
girl
stood
near
each
other
watching
the
annihilation
of
the
craft
and
the
angry
of
dark
green
waters
then
turning
to
his
companion
he
smiled
well
little
miss
storm
maiden
he
said
you
have
saved
my
life
i
guess
by
your
quick
command
although
you
really
wanted
to
shoot
me
since
your
dog
wouldn
t
eat
me
how
d
yo
know
my
name
was
storm
the
truly
amazed
girl
inquired
i
hadn
t
tol
yo
nothin
i
didn
t
know
it
is
that
your
name
the
girl
nodded
muriel
storm
though
calls
me
my
name
the
boy
told
her
is
eugene
beavers
and
my
friends
call
me
gene
my
home
is
in
new
york
but
i
am
visiting
your
doctor
winslow
in
tunkett
he
and
my
dad
are
old
friends
i
ve
been
sick
and
had
to
leave
college
right
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
so
dad
shipped
me
off
down
here
before
he
could
finish
his
sentence
muriel
who
had
been
looking
at
him
steadily
exclaimed
yer
shiverin
wi
the
cold
the
surf
s
like
ice
yo
be
gathering
driftwood
for
a
fire
make
a
tarnal
whopper
while
i
get
some
again
the
girl
scrambled
up
the
trail
among
the
rocks
and
the
dog
went
with
her
for
a
moment
the
lad
stood
gazing
out
at
sea
as
he
ruminated
an
amused
twinkle
in
his
eyes
and
here
i
thought
that
tunkett
at
this
time
of
the
year
would
be
stupid
the
summer
colony
being
closed
but
i
never
had
an
adventure
more
interesting
than
this
gene
had
a
goodly
pile
of
driftwood
collected
when
rilla
reappeared
on
the
rocky
cliff
instead
of
the
gun
she
was
carrying
a
covered
bucket
and
a
thick
china
cup
although
her
manner
of
approaching
him
could
not
really
be
called
friendly
yet
it
was
not
as
hostile
as
her
former
attitude
had
been
she
held
up
the
cup
toward
him
and
filled
it
with
steaming
hot
tea
drink
that
she
commanded
then
added
though
likely
twill
mos
scald
yo
how
the
lad
wanted
to
laugh
just
before
he
had
left
the
city
his
sister
helen
had
dragged
him
to
an
afternoon
tea
or
was
it
a
bazaar
and
there
some
prettily
dressed
girls
had
surrounded
him
offering
him
dainty
porcelain
cups
half
filled
with
fragrant
orange
pekoe
he
was
expected
to
purchase
one
of
them
for
the
sake
of
the
cause
not
wishing
to
offend
any
of
the
fair
friends
of
helen
beavers
he
had
purchased
them
all
and
then
when
unobserved
he
had
slipped
away
to
freedom
again
a
storm
maiden
at
offering
him
tea
the
cup
wasn
t
porcelain
and
the
girl
was
not
effusively
gracious
to
him
as
those
others
who
all
greatly
admired
him
had
been
this
wild
island
girl
was
merely
trying
to
warm
him
up
that
he
need
not
freeze
from
his
unexpected
plunge
into
the
icy
surf
there
was
another
point
of
difference
between
the
two
tea
parties
gene
thought
as
he
drank
the
hot
and
almost
bitter
beverage
his
one
desire
at
the
other
had
been
to
escape
but
at
this
tea
party
he
found
himself
more
interested
than
he
had
been
in
a
long
time
gene
had
several
moments
alone
in
which
to
meditate
for
rilla
having
glanced
at
the
sun
had
suddenly
scrambled
up
the
rocks
and
shading
her
eyes
had
looked
long
toward
the
town
being
satisfied
that
her
had
not
left
tunkett
she
returned
and
lighted
the
dry
wood
which
soon
snapped
and
crackled
then
rising
she
put
her
hands
on
her
hips
and
unsmilingly
gazed
at
the
boy
with
dark
expressive
eyes
after
a
moment
s
solemn
scrutiny
she
inquired
how
come
yo
to
be
cruisin
round
in
that
ol
leaky
hulk
even
a
water
rat
d
had
better
there
seemed
to
the
lad
to
be
a
note
of
scorn
in
the
girl
s
voice
and
yet
she
had
brought
him
tea
gene
lowered
the
cup
and
smiled
at
her
usually
his
smile
was
contagious
it
was
so
genuinely
good
natured
i
don
t
blame
you
in
the
least
for
calling
me
names
he
told
her
i
just
landed
in
tunkett
yesterday
and
not
knowing
how
to
pass
the
time
away
i
went
down
to
the
wharf
and
asked
a
small
boy
if
i
could
hire
a
boat
he
said
i
could
have
my
pick
for
a
dollar
an
hour
he
was
going
with
me
to
where
his
boats
were
tied
i
suppose
but
just
then
some
woman
in
the
store
called
and
away
he
ran
so
i
took
the
first
boat
i
came
to
i
didn
t
notice
that
it
leaked
until
i
was
rounding
the
that
was
little
dexter
s
rents
boats
to
summer
folks
he
asks
a
tarnal
whoppin
price
for
em
pears
well
his
sail
will
cost
me
more
than
one
dollar
the
lad
told
her
his
eyes
twinkling
for
i
ll
have
to
pay
for
the
wreck
i
then
he
added
miss
storm
maiden
why
don
t
you
smile
i
ve
been
here
an
hour
i
do
believe
and
although
you
have
looked
at
me
angrily
and
scornfully
and
solemnly
you
have
not
as
yet
smiled
at
me
i
can
t
be
smilin
when
i
know
i
m
doin
what
s
agin
my
s
orders
but
i
to
mind
him
i
tried
to
ship
yo
off
n
windy
island
i
sure
the
lad
was
puzzled
i
ll
testify
that
you
tried
hard
enough
but
did
you
storm
maiden
surely
you
weren
t
afraid
of
me
i
don
t
then
in
a
few
words
the
girl
told
of
her
s
dislike
for
city
folks
though
she
did
not
tell
him
what
caused
that
dislike
am
i
the
very
first
boy
you
have
ever
talked
with
the
lad
asked
in
amazement
rilla
still
solemn
nodded
she
said

i
m
tarnal
sartin
i
don
know
what
to
do
with
yo
bein
as
yer
boat
s
wrecked

and
it
s
most
that
a
swift
glance
at
the
sun
had
told
rilla
the
time
yo

have
to
hide
in

that

what
i

then
when

day
i
ll
hail
him
an

him
to

yo
to

he
don

city
folks
the
way
as
she
talked
rilla
led
the
way
along
the
shore
and
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
perilous
cliff
above
which
towered
the
lighthouse
thar
s
a
sail
cloth
in
the
cave
as
yo
can
wrap
up
in
and
keep
warm
she
said
then
she
pointed
out
the
steep
trail
the
lad
looked
at
it
and
secretly
wondered
if
he
could
make
it
then
turning
he
held
out
his
right
hand
his
cap
in
the
other
as
he
said
earnestly
miss
muriel
storm
i
thank
you
for
then
he
started
to
climb
the
girl
watched
him
anxiously
steady
there
she
cautioned
keep
an
even
the
lad
reached
the
ledge
in
safety
and
turned
to
wave
his
cap
then
stooping
he
entered
the
cave
and
none
too
soon
for
right
at
that
very
moment
a
stentorian
voice
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
called
rilly
gal
where
be
ye
comin
the
girl
replied
then
she
raced
along
the
strip
of
pebbly
beach
the
dog
at
her
heels
rilla
s
heart
was
pounding
with
tumultuous
excitement
how
she
wished
that
she
could
go
to
her
grandfather
and
tell
him
the
whole
truth
but
she
did
not
dare
chapter
iv
a
shipwrecked
mariner
cap
n
ezra
bassett
was
removing
his
rubber
boots
when
rilla
entered
the
room
the
tea
kettle
was
singing
cheerily
on
the
stove
she
had
refilled
it
when
she
had
made
tea
for
gene
again
the
old
man
noticed
the
flushed
excited
appearance
of
the
girl
rilla
gal
he
said
as
he
tugged
at
one
boot
what
in
tarnation
have
you
got
stowed
away
in
that
cave
o
yourn
that
you
re
so
plumb
interested
in

swan
i
can
t
figger
it
out
maybe
i
d
better
take
a
cruise
down
that
way
and
be
inspectin
below
luckily
rilla
s
back
was
turned
as
she
hurriedly
pared
potatoes
for
the
frying
if
her
had
seen
her
face
at
that
moment
his
suspicions
would
indeed
have
been
aroused
when
she
did
turn
with
the
black
iron
spider
to
put
upon
the
stove
she
was
greatly
relieved
to
see
that
the
old
captain
was
removing
his
second
boot
and
that
he
did
not
mean
to
carry
out
his
threat
to
visit
the
cave
she
began
hoping
to
lead
his
thoughts
into
other
channels
was
thar
anythin
new
as
yo
heard
of
in
town
one
might
have
supposed
by
his
sudden
explosive
ejaculation
that
the
new
channel
into
which
his
thoughts
had
turned
was
not
a
pleasant
one
by
thunder
he
said
one
of
those
city
fellars
landed
in
tunkett
last
night
so
mis
sol
was
sayin
though
what
he
s
doin

i
don

want
yo
to
run
afoul
of
any
city
hifalutin
notions
they
re
all
a
parcel
o
the
old
man
s
speech
was
interrupted
by
a
crash
rilla
had
dropped
a
dish
an
proceeding
for
she
was
as
as
she
was
usually
luckily
the
china
was
thick
and
apparently
unbreakable
the
grub
s
ready
she
said
as
she
poured
into
his
cup
the
strong
steaming
tea
the
old
man
was
pleased
to
note
how
little
interest
his
gal
took
in
the
despised
city
folks
and
he
beamed
across
the
table
at
her
as
he
continued
sho
now
rilly
here
s
some
news
on
a
dif
rent
tack
cap

laid
up
in
drydock
with

not
he
won

be

to
navigate
that
craft
o
his
for
a
week
or
the
girl
s
face
paled
oh
i
m
that
sorry
she
said
but
her
thought
was
inquired
how
can
that
city
chap
get
to
the
mainland
if
cap
n
barney
don
take
him
rilla
had
no
other
intimate
friends
among
the
fishermen
who
would
be
passing
that
evening
on
their
homeward
way
from
the
outer
ledge
where
they
went
at
dawn
each
day
after
cod
captain
barney
she
loved
next
to
her
for
had
he
not
helped
bring
her
up
one
of
her
earliest
recollections
was
of
that
kindly
irishman
holding
her
on
his
knee
and
telling
her
wonderful
tales
of
fairy
folk
who
lived
on
that
far
away
and
dearly
loved
emerald
isle
where
his
boyhood
had
been
spent
never
had
the
girl
wearied
of
listening
to
tales
of
the
mermaids
who
dwelt
in
caves
under
the
cliffs
and
of
the
little
folk
who
went
about
among
the
peat
cabins
helping
the
peasants
but
thar
s
nothin
the
loike
of
thim
over
here
old
cap
n
barney
would
end
with
a
sigh
lest
be
it
s
you
rilly
when
the
noon
meal
was
over
captain
ezra
pushed
back
his
chair

fust
mate
i
reckon
i
ll
cruise
down
to
the
shanty
for
a
spell
an
overhaul
the
kit
holler
if
ye
need
rilla
with
rapidly
beating
heart
stood
in
the
open
door
and
watched
her
as
he
slowly
descended
the
steep
stairs
leading
to
the
little
wharf
near
which
bobbed
the
anchored
dory
about
twenty
feet
up
the
beach
was
the
shanty
in
which
cap
n
ezra
kept
his
fishing
tackle
and
the
supplies
for
the
lighthouse
it
was
hard
indeed
for
the
girl
who
was
as
honest
as
old
cap
n
ezra
himself
to
be
doing
something
of
which
her
would
disapprove
and
yet
she
couldn
t
let
a
boy
starve
even
if
he
had
come
from
the
city
quickly
she
filled
a
basket
with
food
and
tied
it
firmly
to
one
end
of
a
long
rope
going
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
back
of
the
lighthouse
she
called
the
boy
appeared
and
stood
on
the
ledge
looking
up
he
waved
his
cap
in
greeting
and
then
catching
the
swinging
basket
he
untied
it
rilla
drew
up
the
rope
and
let
down
a
pail
of
tea
then
she
knelt
and
leaning
over
as
far
as
she
could
with
safety
she
called
like
s
not
you
ll
have
to
bunk
thar
all
night
cap
n
barney
didn
t
go
fishin
then
before
gene
could
question
her
concerning
some
other
manner
of
reaching
the
mainland
the
girl
disappeared
the
boy
laughed
as
he
the
cave
robinson
crusoe
s
island
was
not
half
as
interesting
as
this
one
he
thought
as
he
ate
with
a
relish
the
homely
fare
which
the
basket
contained
he
had
not
realized
that
he
was
ravenously
hungry
when
the
feast
was
over
the
lad
rose
and
looked
long
out
at
sea
trying
to
discover
the
approach
of
a
boat
that
might
be
signaled
he
knew
that
if
he
did
not
soon
return
to
tunkett
his
host
doctor
winslow
would
become
alarmed
too
he
was
constantly
on
the
alert
for
the
possible
approach
of
rilla
s
grandfather
what
an
old
ogre
he
must
be
the
lad
thought
if
his
is
afraid
to
tell
him
of
the
near
presence
of
a
shipwrecked
as
the
hours
slipped
by
and
no
boat
came
within
signaling
distance
gene
was
tempted
to
walk
boldly
out
from
his
hiding
place
and
tell
the
keeper
of
the
light
that
he
wished
to
be
taken
to
town
but
the
storm
maiden
had
seemed
so
truly
distressed
at
the
mere
thought
that
her
grandfather
might
learn
of
the
presence
of
a
city
boy
on
windy
island
that
out
of
chivalry
he
decided
to
heed
her
wishes
muriel
had
just
replaced
the
rope
in
the
toolhouse
when
she
heard
her
grandfather
s
voice
booming
from
the
foot
of
the
steep
stairway
i
m
comin
the
girl
replied
wondering
what
was
wanted
of
her
could
he
have
seen
her
taking
the
basket
of
food
to
the
cave
she
questioned
but
since
he
was
still
on
the
lower
shore
farthest
from
the
cliff
this
was
not
possible
she
found
the
old
man
busily
mending
a
net
which
was
stretched
out
on
the
sand
in
front
of
the
shanty
rilly
gal
he
said
smiling
up
at
her
thar
s
a
tarnation
lot
o
tears
in
this
ol
net
have
you
time
fust
mate
to
be
helpin
with
the
mendin
of
it
indeed
i
have
all
the
time
there
is
till
sundown
muriel
replied
almost
eagerly
the
girl
s
conscience
had
been
making
her
very
unhappy
it
was
the
first
time
in
the
fifteen
years
they
had
spent
together
that
muriel
had
kept
anything
from
her
grandfather
every
little
unimportant
thing
which
had
occurred
during
the
almost
uneventful
days
had
been
talked
over
with
him
and
the
old
man
would
not
have
believed
it
possible
for
his
gal
to
have
been
secretive
and
yet
during
the
three
hours
that
followed
while
these
two
sat
on
low
stools
mending
the
many
tears
in
the
net
cap
n
ezra
glanced
often
across
at
the
girl
who
with
bent
head
and
flushed
cheeks
was
working
industriously
never
before
had
he
known
his
gal
to
be
so
silent
usually
her
happy
chatter
was
constant
when
they
were
working
together
the
shaggy
grey
brows
were
almost
unconsciously
contracted
and
the
heart
of
the
old
man
was
troubled
at
last
rising
he
went
around
and
stood
beside
his
placing
a
hand
upon
her
bent
head
he
asked
kindly
fust
mate
tell
me
all
about
it
tell
your
ol
what
s
troublin
yo
have
yo
run
afoul
rilly
gal
of
anything
that
s
hurt
yo
the
hazel
eyes
that
were
lifted
were
clear
in
their
gaze
no
not
that
she
replied
then
as
she
said
no
more
but
bent
again
over
her
task
the
old
man
with
folded
arms
stood
gazing
long
across
the
shimmering
waters
and
toward
the
town
when
he
spoke
there
was
almost
a
wistful

to

ol
he
could
say
no
more
for
the
girl
having
leaped
to
her
feet
clasped
her
hands
over
his
mouth
she
lovingly
rebuked
him
how
can

that
didn

safe
harbor
of

love
the
girl
had
slipped
around
and
nestled
in
the
arms
of
the
old
man
lifting
eyes
that
were
brimmed
with
unshed
tears
there
she
was
held
so
close
so
sheltered
and
when
at
last
cap
n
ezra
spoke
he
said
i
don
t
know
what
set
me
to
thinkin
of
all
this
lest
twas
that
barney
said
that
gals
had
a
natural
hankerin
for
young
folks
an
i
s
pose
maybe
they
have
it
s
like
pairin
off

gay
little
pleasure
yacht
with
an
ol
hulk
that
s
most
ready
to
sink
an
oh

way
the
girl
implored
yo
re
goin
to
live
as
long
as
i
do
i
couldn
t
be
livin
without
the
old
man
tried
to
laugh
naturally
what
a
pair
of
loons
we
be
he
said
trying
to
sink
a
ship
afore
it
strikes
a
shoal
seems
he
was
rebuking
himself
for
having
made
his
gal
cry
they
were
soon
busy
again
at
the
mending
but
although
rilla
tried
to
chatter
as
was
her
wont
the
old
man
often
found
his
thoughts
wandering
at
last
he
said
most
sundown
fust
mate
time
for
mess
i
m
thinkin
all
that
evening
rilla
s
thoughts
were
with
gene
beavers
she
had
not
found
another
opportunity
to
slip
away
to
take
food
to
him
and
yet
the
basket
she
had
taken
at
noon
had
contained
enough
for
the
day
that
night
when
she
knelt
by
her
open
window
her
prayer
was
not
only
for
her
and
for
the
father
who
never
came
but
also
for
her
old
friend
cap
n
barney
and
for
her
new
friend
gene
beavers
her
last
waking
thought
was
that
in
the
morning
she
would
go
to
her
and
tell
him
all
that
had
happened
and
that
never
just
never
again
would
she
deceive
him
then
with
a
happier
heart
she
fell
asleep
chapter
a
swim
in
the
night
meanwhile
gene
beavers
had
seated
himself
upon
the
ledge
of
rocks
below
the
cave
and
had
waited
now
and
then
glancing
up
hoping
that
the
storm
maiden
might
appear
with
a
message
for
him
but
the
afternoon
hours
dragged
away
and
she
did
not
come
then
at
last
to
his
joy
he
saw
that
the
fishing
boats
were
one
by
one
leaving
the
outer
ledge
and
sailing
toward
home
scrambling
down
the
steep
cliff
trail
the
lad
ran
along
the
beach
and
went
far
out
on
the
rocky
point
there
he
stood
eagerly
awaiting
the
approach
of
the
boats
ready
when
he
believed
that
he
was
observed
to
signal
to
them
but
because
of
the
direction
of
the
wind
and
the
lowness
of
the
tide
the
fishing
boats
gave
windy
island
a
wide
berth
one
boat
did
turn
on
a
tack
and
for
a
moment
seemed
to
be
bearing
directly
toward
the
point
taking
off
his
white
coat
gene
waved
it
frantically
but
the
lone
fisherman
was
busy
with
the
ropes
just
then
and
did
not
look
up
a
second
later
the
boat
swung
about
on
another
tack
and
gene
realized
with
a
sinking
heart
that
he
could
depend
no
longer
upon
the
fishermen
to
take
him
to
the
mainland
walking
slowly
around
the
island
he
stopped
suddenly
for
he
had
heard
voices
not
far
ahead
of
him
quickly
he
stepped
behind
a
sheltering
boulder
and
none
too
soon
for
it
was
at
that
moment
that
cap
n
ezra
had
risen
and
had
announced
that
it
was
nearly
sundown
and
time
for
the
evening
meal
from
his
hiding
place
gene
observed
all
that
happened
he
noted
how
troubled
was
the
truly
beautiful
face
of
his
storm
perhaps
she
was
anxious
about
him
he
almost
hoped
that
she
was
the
net
was
put
away
in
the
shanty
and
the
old
man
followed
the
girl
up
the
steep
steps
some
time
elapsed
before
gene
stepped
out
from
his
hiding
place
walking
out
upon
the
small
wharf
the
lad
stood
looking
at
the
dory
which
was
anchored
nearby
if
only
he
could
borrow
that
boat
he
thought
he
could
row
to
town
and
hire
someone
to
tow
it
back
but
even
this
he
could
not
do
without
appealing
to
captain
ezra
who
a
few
moments
before
had
shouldered
the
oars
and
carried
them
up
to
the
lighthouse
as
the
lad
stood
gazing
out
over
the
water
of
the
harbor
the
afterglow
of
the
sunset
faded
the
first
stars
came
out
and
dusk
gathered
about
him
he
shivered
for
the
night
air
seemed
suddenly
chill
and
damp
until
then
gene
had
not
been
greatly
concerned
about
his
mishap
considering
it
rather
in
the
light
of
an
interesting
and
novel
adventure
his
host
doctor
winslow
luckily
had
planned
being
away
all
of
that
day
when
he
returns
his
housekeeper
miss
brazilla
mullet
will
inform
him
that
i
did
not
appear
for
the
meal
as
i
had
assured
her
that
i
would
gene
thought
and
he
will
probably
be
greatly
alarmed
it
will
be
easy
enough
to
trace
me
to
the
dock
where
i
hired
the
boat
at
so
early
an
hour
this
morning
and
as
i
did
not
return
it
he
will
naturally
think
that
i
have
met
with
disaster
if
only
i
could
make
the
mainland
within
the
next
hour
i
might
be
able
to
save
mine
host
much
unnecessary
suddenly
a
daring
plan
suggested
itself
the
summer
before
gene
had
won
the
championship
of
his
athletic
club
in
a
handicap
swimming
race
it
was
only
one
mile
to
tunkett
and
moreover
the
wind
blowing
gently
in
from
sea
would
aid
him
greatly
surely
he
could
make
it
for
if
he
wearied
he
could
float
on
his
back
until
he
was
rested
then
another
thought
came
to
remind
him
of
his
recent
illness
was
it
not
to
regain
his
strength
that
he
had
come
to
tunkett
having
left
college
at
the
beginning
of
the
fall
term
when
he
had
won
that
championship
he
had
been
in
the
best
of
trim
shrugging
his
shoulders
gene
beavers
argued
no
more
with
himself
there
seemed
to
be
no
other
alternative
and
so
pulling
off
his
shoes
and
socks
and
throwing
them
to
the
beach
with
his
white
flannel
coat
he
went
to
the
end
of
the
small
wharf
and
plunged
in
as
rilla
had
said
the
water
was
icy
cold
and
the
lad
struck
out
vigorously
to
keep
warm
it
never
would
do
for
him
to
have
a
chill
on
and
on
he
swam
now
and
then
lifting
his
head
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
keeping
a
straight
course
toward
the
town
wharf
on
the
end
of
which
were
three
lights
two
red
and
one
white
how
glad
he
was
to
see
them
the
long
glimmering
reflections
stretched
toward
him
and
yet
they
seemed
farther
away
than
they
had
appeared
from
windy
island
gene
was
nearing
the
silent
shadowy
anchored
fleet
of
fishing
boats
when
he
suddenly
realized
that
his
strength
was
failing
rapidly
if
only
he
could
reach
an
unoccupied
buoy
which
he
saw
bobbing
not
far
ahead
of
him
for
a
moment
he
rested
upon
his
back
but
when
he
tried
to
turn
again
that
he
might
swim
he
felt
too
weak
to
make
the
effort
then
he
was
terrorized
with
the
sudden
realization
that
the
tide
had
changed
and
that
he
was
drifting
slowly
away
from
the
little
fleet
and
out
toward
the
open
sea
gene
made
another
herculean
effort
to
turn
over
and
swim
and
so
great
was
his
determination
he
did
succeed
luckily
the
rising
night
wind
aided
him
and
just
then
a
wave
larger
than
the
others
lifted
him
on
its
rolling
crest
and
hurled
him
up
on
the
buoy
and
there
he
clung
he
had
little
hope
of
being
able
to
long
retain
his
hold
as
his
fingers
were
numb
with
cold
and
his
arms
ached
too
he
felt
drowsy
or
was
it
faint
it
was
at
that
moment
that
his
storm
maiden
knelt
in
her
open
window
and
looking
toward
the
starry
heavens
asked
god
to
care
for
her
new
friend
gene
beavers
meanwhile
as
the
lad
had
surmised
doctor
winslow
was
searching
for
his
guest
chapter
vi
a
searching
party
it
was
nearing
midnight
and
the
huge
lamp
in
the
tower
above
the
cliff
was
mechanically
swinging
in
its
great
iron
frame
hurling
its
beacon
rays
far
out
to
sea
slowly
rythmically
turning
for
a
brief
moment
the
outer
ledge
was
revealed
deserted
and
surf
washed
then
the
almost
even
roll
of
waves
were
illumined
their
white
crests
flashing
in
the
dazzle
of
light
to
be
again
engulfed
in
darkness
slowly
the
lamp
turned
toward
the
town
where
the
three
lanterns
two
red
and
one
white
still
burned
on
the
end
of
the
wharf
to
guide
a
homeward
belated
fisherman
then
the
little
fleet
of
fishing
boats
and
the
buoy
were
for
a
moment
revealed
the
summer
colony
of
cabins
was
next
illumined
too
the
low
rambling
inn
that
would
not
be
opened
for
many
months
then
again
the
wide
path
of
light
swung
out
to
sea
and
started
once
more
on
its
circling
sweep
that
would
continue
until
dawn
it
was
the
custom
of
captain
ezra
to
waken
at
midnight
to
be
sure
that
the
mechanism
of
the
lamp
was
in
perfect
order
he
was
just
descending
the
spiral
stairway
after
a
visit
of
inspection
when
there
came
an
imperative
pounding
without
shags
sleeping
outside
of
rilla
s
door
heard
it
and
leaped
to
his
feet
with
an
ominous
growl
the
girl
startled
from
slumber
sprang
from
her
bed
and
dressed
quickly
she
had
often
done
this
before
when
a
crashing
thunder
storm
had
awakened
her
and
she
wanted
to
be
on
watch
with
her
her
first
conscious
thought
had
been
that
the
expected
equinoctial
storms
had
come
but
when
the
knocking
continued
and
a
man
s
voice
called
cap
n
ezra
quick
open
the
hatch
a
new
fear
clutched
at
the
heart
of
the
girl
perhaps
the
summons
had
something
to
do
with
gene
beavers
the
lad
from
the
city
she
had
not
been
able
the
evening
before
to
hail
him
from
the
top
of
the
cliff
but
surely
he
could
have
kept
warm
if
he
wrapped
well
in
the
sail
cloth
and
there
had
been
food
enough
in
the
basket
for
two
days
at
least
muriel
was
soon
hurrying
down
the
short
flight
of
stairs
that
led
from
her
small
room
above
the
kitchen
her
had
already
flung
the
door
wide
open
and
there
rilla
saw
several
longshoremen
in
slickers
and
sou
westers
who
were
carrying
lanterns
doctor
winslow
was
in
the
lead
and
his
white
drawn
face
plainly
told
how
great
his
anxiety
had
been
lem
ol
pal
what
s
gone
wrong
captain
ezra
inquired
he
drew
the
physician
who
had
been
a
friend
of
his
boyhood
into
the
kitchen
which
was
still
warm
as
the
fire
in
the
stove
had
but
recently
died
down
and
a
few
embers
were
burning
ez
doctor
winslow
began
when
the
men
had
entered
and
closed
the
door
have
you
seen
a
young
boy
a
chap
about
eighteen
sailing
anywhere
near
windy
island
today
you
ve
heard
me
speak
of
dan
beavers
who
was
a
college
mate
of
mine
well
this
is
his
son
he
came
to
tunkett
to
try
to
regain
his
strength
after
a
serious
illness
truth
is
he
ought
not
to
have
attempted
to
sail
a
boat
alone
i
wouldn
t
have
permitted
it
if
i
had
been
at
home
but
i
had
several
calls
to
make
across
the
marshes
and
when
i
go
there
i
make
a
day
of
the
old
sea
captain
was
shaking
his
grizzled
head
as
his
friend
talked

replied
when
the
other
paused

a
cry
from

all
to

and

stood
in
the
open
stair
door
running
to
doctor
winslow
she
caught

she
said

seeing
the
inquiring
expression
on
the
face
of
captain

she
hurried
on
to
explain
his
boat

to
as
he
talked
he
put
on
his
slicker
and
cap
as
the
night
wind
was
cold
then
taking
a
lighted
lantern
cap
n
ezra
after
bidding
rilla
to
liven
up
the
fire
and
put
the
kettle
on
opened
the
door
and
led
the
way
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
making
a
trumpet
of
his
hands
he
shouted
ho
there
down
below
yo
re
wanted
up
on
then
they
waited
listening
but
the
crashing
of
the
surf
was
all
that
they
heard
one
of
the
younger
men
who
was
used
to
scaling
cliffs
however
steep
climbed
down
to
the
ledge
and
held
his
lantern
so
that
the
small
cave
was
illumined
after
a
moment
s
scrutiny
he
called
up
to
the
anxious
group
empty
as
an
ol
clam
shell
nothin
in
there
but
a
box
an
a
sail
cloth
that
s
spread
out
flat
an
concealin
when
muriel
heard
the
men
returning
she
threw
open
the
door
and
her
eager
glance
scanned
the
group
hoping
to
find
among
them
her
new
friend
gene

he

and
then
when

they
started

the

did
not
reply
but
he
held
the
girl
s
hand
in
a
tighter
clasp
then
rising
and
going
to
the
window
he
stood
for
a
moment
looking
out
into
the
darkness
waiting
until
the
circling
light
would
reveal
the
dory
containing
the
three
men

so

the
heart
of
cap
n
ezra
meanwhile
the
three
men
in
the
dory
had
pushed
away
from
the
small
wharf
on
windy
island
and
had
started
rowing
into
the
thick
almost
impenetrable
blanket
of
fog
which
having
swept
in
from
the
sea
had
settled
down
over
the
inner
harbor
they
could
hear
the
melancholy
wail
of
the
foghorn
which
was
beyond
the
outer
ledge
the
two
longshoremen
who
were
with
the
doctor
rowed
toward
the
faint
glimmer
of
red
light
which
could
hardly
be
distinguished
in
fact
there
were
times
when
the
lights
on
the
town
wharf
could
not
be
seen
at
all
and
once
when
the
roaring
of
the
surf
seemed
nearer
than
it
should
be
they
realized
with
sinking
hearts
that
they
had
lost
their
bearings
then
it
was
that
one
of
them
uttered
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
and
alarm
the
big
light
he
cried
what
d
ye
s
pose
has
happened
to
it
look

t
swingin
like
it
should
be

toward

and
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
looming
black
mass
that
was
windy
island
ezra
is
doing
it
to
guide
us
he
said
but
he
s
taking
a
big
then
a
sudden
cry
of
warning
starboard
hard
we
almost
ran
into
that
old
buoy
that
hasn
t
anchored
a
fishing
smack
since
jerry
mullet
s
boat
went
to
the
the
big
light
came
jest
in
the
nick
o
time
i
swan
if
it
didn
t
lute
in
the
bow
declared
as
with
a
powerful
stroke
he
turned
the
dory
so
that
it
slipped
past
the
buoy
barely
scraping
it
straight
ahead
now
give
the
fleet
a
wide
berth
the
doctor
called
the
men
were
pulling
hard
when
one
of
them
stopped
rowing
and
listened
doc
winslow
he
said
tarnation
take
it
if
i
didn
t
hear
a
ghost
right
then
in
that
old
hulk
of
sam
peters
like
s
not
it
s
a
warning
for
us
of
some
being
superstitious
the
longshoreman
was
about
to
pull
away
harder
than
before
when
the
doctor
commanded
belay
there
hold
your
oars
that
s
not
a
ghost
there
s
someone
in
that
boat
more
than
likely
it
s
old
sam
himself
having
one
of
his
periodical
spells
he
won
t
need
help
if
it
is
but
i
can
t
pass
by
without
finding
out
what
is
wrong
thank
heaven
the
light
is
steady
if
all
s
well
on
the
outer
it
took
but
a
moment
the
fog
being
illumined
for
the
dory
to
draw
up
alongside
of
the
boat
that
belonged
to
the
frequently
intoxicated
fisherman
sam
peters
not
a
sound
did
they
hear
as
they
made
fast
i

twa

walley
was
eager
to
return
to
shore
like
as

twa
n
doctor
winslow
listened
intently
he
too
was
anxious
to
reach
the
home
port
knowing
that
not
until
then
would
his
friend
captain
ezra
start
the
big
light
swinging
on
its
seaward
course
but
he
lingered
one
moment
what
ho
sam
there
he
called
but
there
was
no
reply
the
good
doctor
was
about
to
give
the
command
shove
off
get
under
way
when
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
youngest
man
lute
noted
a
movement
of
some
dark
object
he
had
supposed
was
furled
sail
instantly
he
had
leaped
aboard
the
smack
holding
his
lantern
high
he
uttered
a
cry
that
brought
the
doctor
to
his
side
by
time
lute
shouted
it
s
the
boy
himself
but
if
he
ain
t
dead
he
s
durn
close
to
it
was
indeed
gene
beavers
who
after
resting
a
while
on
the
buoy
had
managed
with
almost
superhuman
effort
to
climb
aboard
the
old
fishing
boat
then
he
had
lost
consciousness
in
fact
his
breathing
was
so
slight
that
the
words
of
the
longshoreman
seemed
about
to
be
fulfilled
the
doctor
did
what
he
could
to
revive
the
lad
then
wrapped
him
in
an
old
sail
cloth
ten
minutes
later
rilla
standing
by
the
side
of
captain
ezra
at
a
window
in
the
tower
uttered
a
glad
cry
they
re
swingin
em
they
re
swinging
the
two
red
lights
they
ve
found
him
they
ve
found
gene
god
be
thanked
the
old
man
said
as
he
started
the
big
lamp
turning
on
its
usual
course
the
fog
had
lifted
out
at
sea
and
he
scanned
the
dark
waters
anxiously
eagerly
it
had
been
a
tremendous
chance
that
he
had
taken
and
none
but
his
creator
knew
how
constantly
he
had
been
praying
to
the
one
who
rules
the
sea
that
all
might
be
well
it
was
a
strange
thing
for
captain
ezra
to
pray
but
it
seemed
easier
since
hate
had
been
banished
from
his
heart
muriel
noticed
a
new
expression
in
the
face
of
the
old
man
when
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
he
said
to
her
beaming
over
his
spectacles

on
yer

city
fellar

an
sailin
on
even
the
girl
went
around
the
table
and
stooping
she
pressed
her
warm
young
cheek
against
the
wrinkled
leathery
forehead
the
old
man
reached
for
her
hand
and
held
it
in
a
firm
clasp
neither
spoke
but
both
knew
that
at
last
the
hatred
of
many
years
had
left
the
heart
of
captain

chapter
viii
a
secret
told
doctor
winslow
was
just
leaving
the
room
of
his
patient
when
he
heard
a
familiar
voice
in
the
lower
hall
hurrying
down
the
wide
stairway
he
saw
standing
near
the
door
cap
n
ezra
with
muriel
at
his
side
how
s
the
lad
comin
the
keeper
of
the
light
asked
eagerly
when
greetings
had
been
exchanged
and
the
story
of
the
finding
of
gene
had
been
told
briefly
he
ll
pull
through
i
hope
and
believe
the
doctor
replied
he
is
sleeping
now
and
since
he
is
so
thoroughly
exhausted
he
may
sleep
for
a
long
time
but
when
he
has
recovered
enough
to
sit
up
i
ll
send
over
to
the
island
for
you
rilla
if
your
will
permit
you
to
come
sometimes
pleasant
companionship

more
than
medicine
to
help
young
people
to
i
d
like
to
come
muriel
replied
almost
shyly
and
yet
eagerly
then
her
hazel
eyes
were
lifted
inquiringly
may
i
it
was
a
hard
moment
for
the
old
man
who
had
been
hating
city
folks
for
many
years
but
he
hesitated
only
a
second
then
he
said
lem
i
sort
o
feel
as
all
this
has
been
my
fault
and
if
yo
think
the
boy
ll
get
on

keel
quicker
if

deck
now
and
then
yo

doctor
winslow
held
out
his
hand
thanks
ezra
he
said
hastily
you
re
more
like
what
you
used
to
be
long
ago
and
i
m
mighty
glad
to
see
then
in
an
earnest
tone
he
added
gene
will
take
the
place
to
muriel
of
the
older
brother
that
every
girl
in
this
world
ought
to
have
some
one
near
her
own
age
to
fight
her
battles
to
protect
her
when
the
need
arises
that
s
the
sort
of
a
friend
gene
will
be
to
your
little
girl
ezra
i
ll
give
you
my
word
on
it
because
i
know
him
as
i
knew
his
father
before
him
a
finer
man
never
lived
and
like
the
father
is
the
when
cap
n
ezra
and
muriel
were
again
on
the
main
road
the
girl
said
bein
as
we
re
in
tunkett
let
s
go
over
and
s
prise
uncle
when
rilla
had
been
a
very
little
girl
at
doctor
winslow
s
suggestion
she
had
adopted
that
good
man
as
an
uncle
but
when
captain
barney
heard
her
prattling
uncle
lem
he
declared
that
he
wasn
t
going
to
be
left
out
of
the
family
circle
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
and
from
that
day
the
kindly
old
irishman
had
been
proud
indeed
to
be
called
uncle
barney
by
the
little
maid
who
was
the
idol
of
his
heart
they
found
the
fisherman
sitting
in
the
sun
in
front
of
his
cabin
he
was
whittling
out
a
mast
for
a
toy
schooner
that
he
was
making
for
zoeth
wixon
a
little
crippled
boy
who
lived
in
the
shack
about
an
eighth
of
a
mile
farther
along
on
the
sand
dunes
captain
barney
looked
up
with
a
welcoming
smile
indeed
his
kindly
irish
face
fairly
beamed
when
he
saw
who
his
visitors
were
rising
he
limped
indoors
and
brought
out
his
one
best
chair
a
wooden
rocker
with
a
gay
silk
patchwork
tidy
upon
it
all
of
the
fisherfolk
in
the
neighborhood
had
put
together
the
christmas
before
and
had
purchased
the
gift
for
the
old
bachelor
who
was
always
doing
some
little
thing
to
add
to
their
good
cheer
his
house
is
that
empty
lookin
with
nothin
to
set
on
but
boxes
and
casks
the
mother
of
little
zoeth
had
said
an
he
s
allays
whittlin
suthin
to
help
pass
the
time
away
for
my
little
zo
or
tellin
him
yarns
as
gives
him
suthin
to
think
about
fo
days
i
d
like
to
be
gettin
cap
n
barney
a
present
as
would
make
his
place
look
more
so
too
would
i
sam
peters
had
chimed
in
when
my
ol
man
was
laid
up
for
two
months
las
winter
like
s
not
we
would
have
starved
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
the
fine
cod
that
cap
n
barney
left
at
our
door
every
day
an
fish
bringin
a
fancy
price
then
it
bein
none
too
when
these
women
told
their
plan
it
was
found
that
all
the
families
scattered
about
on
the
meadows
near
the
sea
had
some
kindness
of
cap
n
barney
s
to
tell
about
and
when
the
donated
nickles
and
dimes
and
even
quarters
were
counted
the
total
sum
was
sufficient
to
purchase
a
rocker
in
mis
sol
dexter
s
store
true
it
had
been
broken
a
little
but
sam
peters
having
once
been
ship
carpenter
soon
repaired
it
until
it
looked
like
new
as
for
the
patchwork
tidy
the
little
crippled
boy
himself
had
been
taught
by
his
mother
how
to
make
that
where
to
get
the
pretty
silk
pieces
had
indeed
been
a
problem
for
not
one
of
the
fishermen
s
wives
had
a
bit
of
silk
in
her
possession
it
was
then
that
sol
dexter
did
an
almost
unprecedented
thing
she
told
how
the
year
before
her
store
would
have
burned
up
had
it
not
been
that
cap
n
barney
being
there
at
the
time
had
leaped
right
in
and
had
thrown
his
slicker
over
the
blaze
that
had
started
near
where
the
gasoline
was
kept
he
knew
how
it
might
explode
any
minute
she
said
when
recounting
the
tale
but
he
took
the
while
she
talked
sol
was
actually
cutting
a
piece
off
the
end
of
each
roll
of
ribbon
that
she
had
in
stock
and
then
she
cut
off
lace
enough
to
edge
the
tidy
captain
barney
had
been
greatly
pleased
with
the
gift
and
although
he
never
sat
on
it
himself
he
never
ceased
admiring
the
chair
and
often
wished
his
old
mother
in
ireland
might
have
it
in
her
cabin
the
visitors
had
not
been
there
long
however
when
captain
ezra
said
rilly
gal
why

glad
to
go
for
lindy
wixon
was
near
her
own
age
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
hearing
captain
barney
looked
up
from
his
whittling
well
skipper
he
inquired
what
s
the
cargo
that
yo
re
wantin
to
unload
cap
n
ezra
bassett
puffed
on
his
favorite
corncob
pipe
for
several
thoughtful
moments
before
he
answered
his
friend
s
question
then
looking
up
to
be
sure
that
his
gal
was
not
returning
he
uncrossed
his
legs
and
leaned
forward
barney

he
solemnly
announced

a
tarnal
whoop
for
her
he
hasn
t
been
cruisin
round
these
waters
huntin
her
up
has
he
never
s
been
known
to
navigate
this
way
he
paused
something
in
the
face
of
his
friend
caused
him
to
leave
his
sentence
unfinished
ezra
bassett
arose
and
looked
around
both
corners
of
the
shack
all
that
he
saw
was
a
stretch
of
rolling
white
sand
with
here
and
there
a
clump
of
coarse
wiry
grass
or
a
dwarfed
plum
bush
evidently
satisfied
that
there
was
no
one
near
enough
to
hear
he
returned
and
drawing
his
old
armchair
nearer
the
one
occupied
by
captain
barney
he
said
in
a
low
tone
i
reckon
twa
n
t
his
fault
so
to
speak
i
reckon
twa
n
then
noting
the
surprised
expression
in
the
face
of
his
friend
he
continued
truth
is
he
doesn
t
even
know
there
a
little
gal
fact
was
he
never
did
know
then
he
hurried
on
to
explain
he
d
gone
west
on
business
that
couldn
t
wait
pears
like
an
my
gal
reckoned
as
how
that
would
be
a
mighty
good
time
to
come
to
windy
island
and
get
me
to
forgive
her
and
him
they
was
livin
in
new
york
but
she
didn
t
get
farther
n
boston
when
the
little
one
came
i
got
a
message
to
go
to
her
at
once
i
went
but
when
i
got
there
the
doctor
said
as
they
both
had
died
was
the
message
they
d
sent
on
to
him
but
arter
all
a
miracle
happened
the
baby
showed
signs
of
life
an
what
s
more
she
lived
i
tol
the
doctor
he
needn
t
send
another
message
to
the
father
i
said
as
i
was
the
i
d
tend
to
it
and
take
care
of
the
baby
till
he
while
the
old
man
talked
he
had
been
studying
a
clump
of
wire
grass
in
the
sand
at
his
feet
pausing
he
cast
a
quick
glance
at
his
listener
and
then
as
quickly
looked
away
and
out
to
sea
for
the
first
time
in
the
many
years
of
their
long
friendship
there
was
an
accusing
expression
in
the
clear
blue
eyes
of
the
irishman
d
y
think
yo
ve
acted
honest
ez
captain
barney
inquired
wa
n
t
it
the
same
as
stealin
his
gal
at
that
captain
ezra
flared
didn
t
steal
gal
fust
if
it
comes
to
that
turn
about
s
fair
play
ain
t
it
the
old
irishman
shook
his
head
dunno
as
tis
ez
he
said
slowly
i
reckon
a
person
s
a
heap
happier
doin
the
right
thing
himself
whether
the
other
fellar
does
it
or
captain
ezra
bassett
felt
none
too
comfortable
wall
he
said
that
s
why
i
wanted
to
have
this
talk
with
yo
i
got
to
thinkin
lately
of
what
would
become
of
rilly
if
i
should
get
a
sudden
call
across
the
bar
as
the
hymn
puts
it
without
havin
left
any
word
or
made
any
provisions
so
i
reckoned
i
d
tell
yo
as
how
i
ve
writ
that
letter
i
put
it
in
the
iron
box
on
the
shelf
way
up
top
o
the
tower
where
i
keep
the
tools
for
regulatin
the
captain
barney
nodded
he
knew
the
shelf
well
for
he
had
often
helped
clean
the
big
lamp
or
aided
in
some
needed
adjustment
where
d
yo
reckon
he
is
s
dad
he
asked
after
they
had
puffed
awhile
in
thoughtful
silence
dunno
was
the
reply
never
heard
sense
i
allays
suspicioned
as
how
he
might
have
stayed
anchored
out
west
but
i
know
where
rilly
gal
can
go
to
find
out
if
need
be
an
i
ve
put
the
address
in
the
then
the
old
man
rose
looking
the
picture
of
rugged
health
not
that
i
m
expectin
to
start
in
a
hurry
on
the
long
v
yage
for
which
no
charts
have
been
made
he
said
but
i
sort
o
got
to
thinkin
it
s
well
to
be
beforehanded
an
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
for
a
breeze
sweeping
over
the
dunes
brought
to
them
not
only
the
soft
salt
tang
of
the
sea
but
also
the
notes
of
a
girlish
song
both
men
turned
to
see
a
picture
which
rejoiced
their
hearts
rilla
swinging
her
sunday
best
hat
by
its
ribbon
strings
was
skipping
toward
them
over
the
hard
sand
her
long
hair
blowing
about
her
shoulders
her
face
radiant
as
she
sang
captain
ezra
beckoned
to
her
rilly
gal
he
called
it
s
by
the
sun
and
the
big
lamp
s
to
have
a
fine
polishin
today
i
reckon
the
storms
ll
come
most
any
time
now
and
the
light
needs
to
be
its
brightest
turning
to
captain
barney
he
said
in
a
low
voice
keep
it
dark
mate
bout
the
letter
in
the
i
m
tell
when
his
two
best
friends
had
departed
captain
barney
sat
long
in
front
of
his
shack
he
wondered
what
was
to
come
of
it
all
but
only
the
future
could
reveal
that
chapter
ix
a
first
letter
muriel
had
almost
forgotten
the
banded
box
of
foreign
appearance
which
she
had
in
her
treasure
cave
so
many
things
of
unusual
interest
had
occurred
of
late
that
even
so
wonderful
a
box
had
taken
a
secondary
place
in
her
thoughts
that
afternoon
captain
ezra
devoted
to
polishing
the
lamp
a
task
he
would
not
permit
rilla
to
share
saying
that
peeling
potatoes
and
the
like
was
her
part
of
the
drudgery
and
as
he
never
helped
her
with
that
neither
should
she
help
with
the
lamp
muriel
did
not
insist
for
she
believed
that
her
took
a
great
deal
of
pride
in
tending
to
the
big
light
all
by
himself
i
reckon
he
d
think
he
was
gettin
old
if
he
had
to
be
helped
the
girl
soliloquized
as
she
walked
along
the
top
of
the
bluff
the
dog
at
her
side
they
descended
the
trail
toward
that
part
of
the
beach
where
she
had
first
seen
the
lad
for
a
time
she
stood
silently
gazing
down
at
the
spot
where
he
had
been
on
that
never
to
be
forgotten
day
suddenly
she
laughed
aloud
stooping
she
patted
the
head
of
her
companion
shagsie
ol
dog
she
chuckled
gleefully
yo
wouldn
t
be
eatin
gene
beavers
up
even
when
i
tol
yo
to
would
yo
now
then
merrily
she
added
i
ll
tell
yo
a
secret
ol
dog
if
yo
won
t
be
tellin
then
she
whispered
into
the
long
shaggy
ear
i
reckon
i
m
now
that
yo
wouldn
then
springing
up
she
scrambled
down
the
rocks
and
ran
along
the
narrow
pebbly
beach
the
dog
racing
and
barking
at
her
heels
when
they
were
just
below
the
lighthouse
rilla
paused
and
looked
up
at
the
small
entrance
to
her
cave
shags
she
suggested
let
s
take
another
look
at
the
together
they
slowly
ascended
the
perilously
steep
cliff
where
one
unused
to
climbing
could
barely
have
found
a
foothold
when
the
cave
was
reached
rilla
uttered
a
little
cry
of
eagerness
for
under
one
of
the
straps
on
the
box
was
a
folded
bit
of
paper
opening
it
she
looked
at
it
her
cheeks
flushed
her
eyes
glowing
doctor
winslow
had
tried
to
teach
the
girl
to
read
but
since
he
was
the
resident
physician
in
a
new
york
hospital
most
of
the
year
he
had
been
able
to
make
but
little
headway
each
autumn
he
took
from
one
to
two
months
vacation
returning
to
the
home
of
his
boyhood
for
what
he
called
an
absolute
rest
but
the
fisherfolk
who
loved
him
flocked
to
him
for
advice
and
help
and
the
kind
elderly
man
welcomed
them
gladly
too
he
gave
to
every
one
who
came
a
bit
of
optomistic
philosophy
which
did
much
toward
keeping
them
well
and
happy
during
the
months
of
his
absence
muriel
had
seated
herself
upon
the
closed
box
and
studied
the
note
luckily
the
words
were
simple
and
plainly
printed
she
picked
out
one
here
and
there
that
she
knew
then
suddenly
rising
she
went
to
a
crevice
in
the
rocks
and
brought
forth
a
second
reader
which
the
doctor
had
given
her
she
knew
every
word
in
it
but
she
could
not
always
recognize
the
same
words
if
they
were
out
of
the
book
after
an
hour
s
diligent
search
comparing
the
printed
words
with
those
in
the
note
she
looked
up
her
expression
joyous
exultant
shagsie
ol
dog
i
can
read
it
i
can
read
every
word
it
s
the
fust
letter
as
i
ever
had
an
gene
beavers
twas
as
left
it
for
then
as
the
faithful
dog
seemed
to
be
interested
the
girl
slowly
read
aloud
dear
storm
maiden
am
going
to
try
to
reach
town
tonight
i
hope
to
see
you
again
but
if
i
do
not
i
want
you
to
know
how
much
i
like
you
i
wish
girls
were
all
as
brave
and
kind
as
you
are
thank
you
and
goodbye
your
friend
gene
when
the
reading
was
finished
the
girl
sat
for
a
long
time
looking
out
of
the
small
opening
at
the
gleaming
blue
waters
beyond
the
cliff
and
her
expression
grew
wistful
and
almost
pensive
for
the
first
time
in
her
fifteen
years
she
was
wishing
she
had
learnin
suddenly
she
sprang
up
her
face
brightening
shags
she
said
many
s
the
time
uncle
lem
has
said
regrettin
doesn
t
get
you
anywhere
it
s
what
you
re
doin
that
we
ll
learn
to
read
shags
ol
dog
i
dunno
how
but
we
re
goin
to
that
evening
as
rilla
sat
close
to
her
she
wanted
to
ask
him
if
she
might
attend
the
tunkett
school
but
he
seemed
hardly
to
know
that
she
was
there
so
occupied
was
he
with
his
own
thoughts
and
so
she
decided
to
await
a
more
opportune
time
the
truth
was
that
captain
ezra
could
not
forget
the
accusing
expression
in
the
irish
blue
eyes
of
his
old
mate
nor
the
question
d
y
reckon
yo
re
actin
honest
ez
hasn
t
it
been
the
same
as
stealin
his
little
gal
that
night
long
after
muriel
was
asleep
in
her
loft
room
captain
ezra
sat
at
the
kitchen
table
trying
to
compose
a
letter
to
the
father
of
rilla
but
each
attempt
was
torn
to
shreds
and
many
times
the
old
man
stealthily
crossed
the
kitchen
floor
and
placed
the
bits
in
the
stove
at
last
he
thought
i
reckon
barney
s
right
but
thar
s
no
tarnation
hurry
i
ve
signed
articles
to
tend
to
this
light
till
i
m
a
long
ways
older
n
i
am
so
thinking
he
went
to
his
bed
meaning
soon
to
send
the
letter
to
muriel
s
father
but
one
thing
and
another
occupied
his
time
and
the
letter
remained
unwritten
chapter
x
the
hoped
for
message
each
morning
when
rilla
had
finished
her
task
of
swabbing
decks
as
captain
ezra
called
it
and
had
put
the
kitchen
and
small
bedrooms
into
shipshape
there
were
no
other
rooms
in
the
adjoining
the
light
she
would
stand
in
the
open
door
gazing
out
across
the
harbor
waiting
watching
for
what
she
barely
confessed
to
herself
but
on
the
third
day
her
anxiety
concerning
her
new
friend
s
condition
overcame
her
timidity
at
broaching
the
subject
and
after
breakfast
she
ventured
will
yo
be
cruisin
to
town
today
the
old
man
shook
his
head
no
rilly
gal
he
replied
i
wasn
t
plannin
to
yo
don
need
nother
hair
ribbon
do
yo
he
had
been
filling
a
lantern
as
he
spoke
but
suddenly
he
paused
and
looked
up
sho
now
fust
mate
are
yo
prognosticatin
bout
that
city
chap
he
arose
and
looked
out
across
the
water
shading
his
eyes
with
his
big
leathery
hand
i
reckon
tis
mos
time
for
lem
to
be
lettin
us
know
how
things
are
comin
i
sartin
do
hope
the
young
fellar
is
navigatin
that
frail
craft
of
his
into
smoother
waters
pears
like
doctor
lem
ought
he
said
no
more
for
the
girl
had
suddenly
clutched
his
arm
as
she
cried
excitedly
look
yo
i
m
sure
sartin
there
s
little
sol
puttin
out
from
the
wharf
in
that
water
rat
boat
o
his
now
he
s
dippin
along
and
scuddin
right
this
i
reckon
he
has
a
message
for
us
more
n
like
uncle
lem
is
sendin
the
two
gazed
intently
at
the
small
boat
which
did
indeed
seem
to
be
headed
directly
for
windy
island
rilla
her
heart
tripping
unconsciously
held
tighter
to
the
arm
of
the
old
man
pore
little
girl
he
thought
was
she
that
lonesome
for
young
company
he
sighed
and
placed
a
big
hand
over
the
slender
brown
one
he
felt
the
tenseness
of
the
girl
s
arm
she
said
tremulously
what
if
the
message
is
that
gene
beavers
has
died
i
reckon
twould
be
all
my
fault
i
d
ought
to
have
brought
him
right
up
to
the
house
an
tol
you
straight
out
just
what
had
anxiously
they
watched
the
oncoming
boat
the
wind
which
had
been
fitful
all
the
morning
dwindled
to
the
softest
breeze
then
a
calm
settled
over
the
harbor
and
the
sail
of
the
water
rat
flapped
idly
why
don
t
little
sol
row
muriel
exclaimed
impatiently
then
eagerly
may
i
go
out
in
the
dory
an
meet
him
may
i
no
use
to
rilly
gal
the
wind
s
veered
an
thar
goes
sol
now
on
a
tack
yo
can
t
be
rowin
zigzag
all
over
the
then
as
the
boy
seemed
to
be
leisurely
sailing
away
from
the
island
the
old
man
stooped
and
picked
up
his
lantern
sho
fust
mate
he
said
i
reckon
we
re
way
off
our
bearin
s
little
sol
wa
n
t
headin
this
way
pears
like
just
cruisin
about
aimless
like
he
often
the
girl
also
decided
that
this
was
the
truth
and
so
she
went
indoors
to
procure
the
week
s
mending
when
she
returned
to
the
armchair
outside
the
lighthouse
she
saw
that
the
water
rat
was
scudding
over
the
dancing
waves
in
quite
the
opposite
direction
captain
ezra
had
climbed
the
tower
rilla
seated
herself
and
soon
her
fingers
flew
as
she
sewed
a
patch
upon
a
blue
denim
garment
while
her
thoughts
returned
to
gene
beavers
she
recalled
that
he
had
looked
frail
but
she
had
supposed
his
paleness
was
due
to
the
fact
that
he
lived
in
the
city
too
she
realized
that
she
had
been
hoping
for
days
that
doctor
winslow
would
send
a
message
telling
her
that
gene
beavers
was
sitting
up
and
that
she
might
visit
him
for
wonder
of
wonders
her
had
said
that
she
might
go
looking
up
from
the
garment
a
few
moments
later
her
glance
again
swept
over
the
gleaming
waters
of
the
harbor
the
water
rat
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
alarmed
the
girl
sprang
to
her
feet
and
ran
to
the
top
of
the
steep
flight
of
steps
leading
down
to
the
shore
her
anxiety
was
quickly
changed
to
joy
for
clattering
up
toward
her
was
the
boy
and
a
grin
of
delight
spread
over
his
homely
features
when
he
saw
her
rilly
look
t
that
will
yo
he
sang
out
as
he
held
up
a
silver
dollar
made
it
as
easy
as
sailin
yo
couldn
t
guess
how
i
bet
could
yo
now
the
girl
shook
her
head
and
then
listened
eagerly
breathlessly
hoping
that
in
reality
she
did
know
nor
was
she
wrong
well
the
boy
confided
that
city
guy
that
s
up
to
doc
winslow
s
he
twas
guv
it
to
me
if
i
d
fetch
a
note
over
to
windy
island
and
hand
it
to
cap
n
ezra
and
to
no
one
else
says
rilla
s
eyes
shone
like
stars
running
to
the
door
at
the
foot
of
the
spiral
stairs
that
led
up
to
the
light
she
shouted
are
yo
down
or
shall
we
come
up
little
sol
s
here
an

interrupted
twas
gene
beavers
himself
as
sent
the
note
and
he
said
as
it
was
to
be
given
to
no
one
but
just
yo
the
old
sea
captain
was
pleased
the
boy
was
square
and
aboveboard
that
was
evident
wall
he
said
as
he
reached
the
ground
little
sol
hist
up
the
the
small
boy
thrust
his
hand
in
one
of
his
pockets
but
drew
it
empty
jumpin
frogs
he
ejaculated
if

that
letter
i
reckon

suddenly
his
expression
changed
and
he
beamed
up
at
them
by
time
i
rec
lect
now
i
stowed
it
in
here
for
safe
keepin
as
he
spoke
he
removed
his
cap
and
took
the
note
from
the
ragged
lining
he
handed
the
envelope
to
the
captain
and
then
started
running
toward
the
steps
leading
to
the
beach
but
the
old
man
recalled
him
ho
thar
little
sol
lay
to
a
spell
i
reckon
there
may
be
an
answer
to
go
ashore
with
the
boy
returned
slowly
and
the
girl
eagerly
watched
the
captain
as
he
read
the
message
which
the
note
contained
muriel
knew
by
the
expression
in
her
grandfather
s
face
that
the
struggle
was
going
on
in
his
heart
but
it
didn
t
last
long
is
gene
beavers
up
the
girl
asked
pears
like
he
is
captain
ezra
said
as
he
folded
the
note
and
placed
it
in
his
pocket
lem
s
writ
for
you
to
cruise
over
to
town
with
little
sol
and
stay
a
muriel
s
face
shone
but
after
glancing
at
the
sun
she
inquired
wouldn
t
i
better
wait
till
arter
who
ll
be
fryin
the
fish
and
pertaters
for
yo
the
old
man
s
heart
rejoiced
for
his
gal
was
really
thinking
of
him
first
after
all
but
his
hearty
laughter
pealed
out
as
he
replied
when
yo
was
a
little
un
who
d
yo
s
pose
fried
cod
for
the
two
of
us
if
twa
n
t
me
i
was
steward
o
the
lighthouse
craft
long
afore
yo
signed
articles
to
sail
along
as
fust
impulsively
the
girl
threw
her
arms
about
the
neck
of
the
old
man
and
kissed
his
leathery
cheek
she
took
this
opportunity
to
whisper
into
his
ear
yo
re
that
good
to
me
i
ll
never
be
leavin
you
never
never
never
instinctively
the
girl
knew
what
was
in
the
thought
of
the
old
man
little
sol
was
eager
to
return
to
the
mainland
that
he
might
display
to
his
mother
the
first
silver
dollar
that
he
had
ever
earned
and
so
the
happy
girl
climbed
to
the
little
room
over
the
kitchen
and
put
on
what
her
called
her
sunday
riggin
she
hesitated
just
a
moment
between
the
red
hair
ribbon
and
the
green
then
choosing
the
latter
she
peered
into
the
broken
bit
of
mirror
to
tie
it
as
best
she
could
on
her
hair
then
seizing
her
hat
by
its
strings
down
the
stairs
she
skipped
shags
sensing
the
holiday
spirit
that
was
in
the
air
barked
joyfully
when
she
appeared
and
was
quite
crestfallen
when
he
was
told
that
he
must
stay
and
help
guard
the
light
the
old
man
stood
at
the
top
of
the
steps
and
swung
his
cap
when
muriel
sitting
in
the
stern
of
the
water
rat
turned
at
the
first
buoy
and
waved
to
him
in
the
heart
of
captain
ezra
for
the
second
time
in
many
years
there
was
a
prayer
that
the
one
at
the
helm
might
guide
his
gal
aright
chapter
xi
a
party
for
two
brazilla
mullet
the
elderly
spinster
sister
of
jabez
mullet
who
drove
the
stage
had
been
the
doctor
s
housekeeper
for
many
years
she
and
her
brother
occupied
the
neat
little
cottage
just
beyond
the
hedge
and
jabez
when
he
was
not
driving
was
gardener
for
both
places
half
an
hour
after
gene
beavers
had
sent
the
note
to
windy
island
by
little
sol
from
the
end
of
doctor
winslow
s
veranda
he
had
been
eagerly
watching
the
road
miss
brazilla
busied
herself
in
the
rooms
adjoining
that
she
might
hear
the
boy
s
slightest
movement
doctor
winslow
had
cautioned
her
that
gene
who
was
restless
because
of
his
prolonged
inactivity
must
not
be
permitted
to
leave
the
couch
where
he
was
comfortably
propped
to
a
position
that
was
half
reclining
by
many
pillows
the
doctor
himself
after
having
written
the
note
to
captain
ezra
had
been
suddenly
called
on
an
emergency
case
out
at
the
life
saving
station
on
the
point
and
that
was
why
gene
had
been
the
one
to
give
instructions
concerning
the
delivery
of
the
message
what
time
is
it
now
miss
brazilla
the
boy
asked
it

nigh

the
housekeeper
appeared
in
the
doorway
to
remark

i

folks
if

be
helpin
if
the
elderly
spinster
miss
brazilla
might
be
said
to
have
a
failing
it
was
loquacity
and
gene
moved
restlessly
instantly
she
was
at
his
side
there
now
dearie
the
really
woman
exclaimed
i
d
ought
to
ve
pushed
that
couch
farther
to
the
starboard
side
o
this
then
she
laughed
apologetically
that
salt
water
language

crop
out
now

then

as
i
may
to
talk
fine
like
city
folks

a
reg
lar
party
for
her
an
poor
gene
realizing
that
miss
brazilla
was
launched
again
upon
another
flood
of
conversation
tried
to
think
of
a
way
to
politely
interrupt
if
an
interruption
ever
can
be
polite
the
word
party
caught
his
attention
many
a
time
he
had
heard
his
sister
helen
say
it
s
never
a
real
party
unless
there
s
ice
maybe
all
girls
felt
that
way
the
housekeeper
was
actually
turning
to
leave
having
reached
a
period
and
gene
made
haste
to
inquire
miss
brazilla
is
there
any
place
in
tunkett
where
we
could
get
some
ice
cream
the
amazed
spinster
shook
her
head
on
which
the
rather
sparse
hairs
were
drawn
back
and
down
with
oily
smoothness
why
no
master
gene
not
arter
the
summer
colony
folks
go
when
the
hot
weather
s
on
sol
makes
telephone
her
please
miss
brazilla
and
ask
her
if
she
couldn
t
make
some
right
away
now
and
put
strawberries
in
it
tell
her
that
she
may
name
her
own
miss
mullet
lifted
her
hands
in
amazement
land
o
goshen
she
ejaculated
ice
cream
with
strawberries
in
then
noting
that
the
lad
had
dropped
back
among
the
pillows
and
closed
his
eyes
as
though
he
were
suddenly
very
weary
the
good
woman
slipped
away
to
do
his
bidding
strange
as
it
might
seem
sick
folks
take
notions
she
said
to
herself
but
this
is
the
tarnal
queerest
i
ever
heerd
half
an
hour
later
there
was
a
timid
rap
on
the
side
door
miss
brazilla
hurried
to
open
it
and
as
she
had
hoped
there
stood
muriel
storm
gene
had
fallen
into
a
light
slumber
which
had
greatly
refreshed
him
and
when
he
awakened
he
heard
muriel
s
voice
top
o
the
morning
to
you
storm
maiden
he
called
do
hurry
i
m
eager
to
see
if
you
look
as
i
remember
but
she
did
not
for
the
muriel
with
her
long
hair
neatly
tied
back
with
a
wide
green
ribbon
which
miss
brazilla
had
made
for
her
into
a
truly
beautiful
butterfly
bow
did
not
look
quite
like
his
memoried
picture
of
that
stormy
girl
who
with
long
hair
about
her
shoulders
had
ordered
him
to
leave
the
lighthouse
island
or
be
devoured
by
her
dog
almost
shyly
the
girl
in
her
neat
green
gingham
dress
paused
in
the
open
doorway
hardly
knowing
what
to
do
gene
held
out
a
frail
white
hand
won
t
you
come
and
shake
hands
with
me
he
asked
i
m
sorry
that
i
can
t
come
to
you
but
i
have
had
orders
to
lie
here
until
mine
host
decrees
the
girl
touched
by
the
boy
s
paleness
forgot
her
embarrassment
and
went
toward
him
placing
her
strong
brown
hand
in
the
one
he
had
stretched
forth
to
greet
her
then
seating
herself
in
the
wicker
chair
nearest
she
said
i
hope
yo
re
forgivin
me
beavers
for
makin
it
so
that
yo
had
to
it
was
i
who
used
poor
judgment
the
boy
told
her
don
t
feel
that
you
were
in
the
least
bit
to
then
smiling
up
at
her
in
his
friendliest
fashion
he
added
we
are
only
in
our
teens
you
and
i
and
that
s
not
so
very
grown
up
don
t
you
think
you
could
call
me
gene
and
permit
me
to
call
you
muriel
it
s
a
beautiful
twas
my
mother
the
boy
thought
he
had
never
heard
that
word
spoken
with
greater
tenderness
shyly
the
girl
was
saying
an
i
d
be
that
pleased
if
yo
would
call
me
the
whole
of
it
thar
s
no
one
as
calls
me
muriel
folks
here
jest
call
me
then
i
will
gladly
now
muriel
the
lad
leaned
on
his
elbow
the
best
way
for
two
people
to
become
acquainted
is
by
asking
questions
won
t
you
tell
me
how
you
pass
your
time
what
books
you
read
gene
paused
almost
startled
by
the
sudden
flush
that
had
crimsoned
the
cheeks
of
his
guest
when
it
was
too
late
he
tried
to
prevent
her
from
having
to
make
the
admission
but
falteringly
she
made
it
i
can
t
read
books
she
said
then
the
resolve
of
the
day
before
gave
her
new
courage
and
lifting
her
head
and
looking
directly
into
his
eyes
with
an
eager
expression
she
added
but
i
m
goin
to
learn
i
don
know
how
but
i
m
goin
of
course
you
are
muriel
was
his
hearty
response
and
if
i
am
laid
up
long
in
dry
dock
for
repairs
as
jabez
mullet
calls
my
confinement
perhaps
you
will
let
me
help
you
had
to
be
helped
you
know
we
all
do
just
in
the
the
lad
s
smile
was
winsome
then
he
quickly
added
there
are
the
noon
bells
from
the
church
tower
and
if
i
m
not
mistaken
miss
brazilla
is
coming
to
serve
our
muriel
sprang
up
when
the
housekeeper
appeared
why
miss
brazilla
me
settin
here
and
lettin
yo
wait
on
me
mayn
t
i
help
somehow
i
m
real
handy
at
so
you
are
rilly
fetch
that
little
wicker
table
over
here
and
stand
it
near
the
couch
then
draw
your
chair
and
set
opposite
yo
re
company
today
just
like
a
grand
young
lady
and
yo
ve
nothin
to
do
but
muriel
went
to
the
far
end
of
the
veranda
to
get
the
small
wicker
table
and
when
she
turned
she
was
amazed
to
see
miss
brazilla
and
gene
exchanging
nods
and
smiles
what
could
it
mean
the
girl
wondered
the
lunch
was
daintily
served
and
gene
became
so
interested
in
his
companion
s
tales
of
storms
and
wrecks
at
sea
simply
yet
dramatically
told
that
he
ate
far
more
heartily
than
he
would
have
done
alone
miss
brazilla
made
no
comment
but
she
was
secretly
pleased
having
cleared
the
table
she
surprised
muriel
by
bringing
in
two
dishes
heaped
with
ice
cream
in
which
were
preserved
strawberries
gene
beavers
was
to
pay
a
fabulous
price
for
that
dessert
but
when
he
saw
the
glad
light
dawning
in
the
hazel
eyes
of
his
guest
he
decided
it
was
well
worth
it
i
only
had
ice
cream
once
before
she
confessed
an
that
was
when
mis
sol
had
some
left
over
that
was
like
to
after
lunch
muriel
told
her
host
that
he
ought
to
sleep
a
while
and
when
she
assured
him
that
she
could
stay
all
afternoon
the
truly
weary
lad
consented
to
rest
while
rilla
helped
miss
brazilla
in
the
kitchen
an
hour
later
when
the
lad
awakened
refreshed
he
saw
that
muriel
was
again
in
the
comfortable
wicker
chair
at
his
side
looking
with
great
interest
at
the
beautifully
colored
pictures
in
a
large
book
that
she
held
she
glanced
up
glowingly
when
she
heard
a
movement
on
the
couch
the
readin
in
it
is
about
the
sea
i
reckon
from
the
pictures
of
boats
and
pirates
she
told
him
it
is
indeed
gene
exclaimed
with
enthusiasm
that
s
treasure
island
if
you
ll
prop
me
up
more
i
ll
read
to
you
if
you
some
time
later
when
winslow
returned
he
found
gene
reading
aloud
from
his
favorite
book
while
muriel
leaning
forward
listened
hungrily
well
little
nurse
rilla
the
good
man
exclaimed
our
patient
is
much
better
i
can
see
that
at
a
glance
i
m
sorry
to
hurry
you
away
but
your
boatswain
sol
is
waiting
for
you
down
at
the
gate
your
told
him
to
sail
you
back
to
windy
island
along
about
this
time
but
you
re
to
come
again
and
that
night
captain
ezra
pushed
his
armchair
back
from
the
table
and
while
he
was
lighting
his
pipe
he
looked
at
his
gal
his
eyes
twinkling
rilly
he
said
yo
ve
been
gabblin
faster
n
chain
lightnin
one
hour
by
the
clock
an
things
are
sort
o
muddled
in
my
mind
i
dunno
for
sure
sartin
whether
it
s
billy
bones
or
gene
beavers
yo
ve
been
over
to
the
mainland
a
visitin
both
of
em
thanks
to
yo
dear
ol
muriel
said
then
kissing
him
she
went
up
to
her
little
loft
room
but
when
she
was
snugly
in
her
bed
it
was
not
of
billy
bones
that
she
dreamed
chapter
xii
wee
irishy
cakes
muriel
awakened
the
next
morning
with
a
song
in
her
heart
that
she
was
soon
expressing
in
clear
sweet
notes
which
told
the
listener
how
glad
glad
the
singer
was
just
to
be
alive
captain
ezra
busying
himself
near
the
open
kitchen
door
sighed
softly
as
he
realized
that
this
wordless
song
was
different
from
the
others
that
muriel
had
sung
in
the
mornings
that
were
past
as
she
prepared
their
simple
breakfast
there
had
been
words
to
those
other
songs
sometimes
hymns
that
the
lassie
had
memorized
from
having
often
heard
them
repeated
at
the
whither
she
had
been
permitted
to
go
when
the
summer
colony
was
closed
then
again
there
had
been
times
when
she
had
set
words
of
her
own
to
the
tunes
lilting
melodies
they
were
of
winging
gulls
and
of
the
mermaids
who
lived
in
the
sea
but
this
morning
there
was
a
new
and
eager
joyousness
in
the
girl
s
singing
for
the
first
time
in
her
fifteen
years
the
gates
of
her
prison
had
been
flung
wide
and
she
had
stepped
out
into
a
strange
world
timidly
perhaps
but
soon
forgetting
herself
in
her
delight
at
what
she
had
found
a
world
of
books
of
young
companionship
of
adventure
and
romance
muriel
even
if
she
were
again
imprisoned
would
never
be
quite
the
same
but
the
newly
awakened
love
in
the
heart
of
captain
ezra
had
been
the
key
that
had
opened
the
door
for
his
gal
and
she
was
now
free
to
come
and
go
as
she
wished
because
he
trusted
her
she
would
not
leave
him
without
telling
him
nor
would
he
detain
her
if
she
wished
to
go
top
o
the
mornin
to
you
she
called
when
the
fish
were
done
to
a
turn
and
the
potatoes
were
crispy
brown
i
ve
a
mind
to
be
bakin
today
she
continued
when
he
was
seated
at
the
table
some
o
those
wee
irishy
cakes
that
uncle
barney
taught
me
how
to
make
just
like
his
auld
mother
did
he
s
allays
askin
for
em
when
he
docks
at
windy
island
he
s
been
laid
up
so
long
i
cal
late
the
taste
of
em
might
be
cheerin
him
wouldn
t
you
reckon
they
might
the
young
arms
were
about
the
old
man
s
neck
and
her
fresh
young
cheek
rested
against
the
forehead
that
was
leathered
by
exposure
to
the
sun
and
wind
and
beating
rain
there
was
a
twinkle
in
the
grey
eye
that
was
nearest
her
i
as
twould
add
to
ol
cap
n
barney
s
cheer
if
the
stewardess
herself
toted
them
cookies
to
his
stranded
ol
craft
on
the
dunes
was
that
what
yo
was
figgerin
on
doin
fust
mate
if
yo
d
like
to
take
me
this
very
demurely
the
old
sea
captain
put
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
laughed
heartily
i
reckon
a
gal
who
knows
how
to
sail
a
boat
better
n
most
folks
don
need
a
boatman
to
cruise
her
over
to
the
mainland
sho
now
rilly
navigate
yer
own
craft
the
embargo
s
lifted
as
the
newspapers
put
it
come
and
go
when
it
s
to
yer
likin
jest
be
lettin
me
then
he
added
as
though
it
were
an
when
yo
carry
yer
cargo
o
cakes
to
town
if
i
was
yo
i
d
leave
a
few
at
miss
brazilla
s
cottage
i
reckon
yer
new
friend
might
be
likin
the
taste
o
suthin
differ
muriel
s
cheeks
were
rosy
she
protested
i
wa
n
t
thinkin
of
gene
beavers
honest
i
wa
n
t
i
just
reckoned
twasn
t
fair
for
me
to
be
spendin
a
whole
arternoon
wi
a
friend
when
an
ol
one
who
s
been
lovin
me
for
years
back
is
laid
up
in
drydock
an
needs
me
even
the
hazel
eyes
looked
across
the
table
so
frankly
that
the
teasing
twinkle
faded
in
the
grey
eyes
and
an
expression
of
infinite
tenderness
took
its
place
i
reckon
i
understand
fust
mate
the
old
man
said
cap
n
barney
s
got
a
heart
in
him
as
big
as
the
hold
in
a
freight
boat
but
thar
s
a
powerful
lot
of
loneliness
in
it
for
all
that
he
s
allays
doin
neighborly
things
for
the
folks
on
the
dunes
barney
s
been
hankerin
for
years
to
be
goin
back
to
his
ol
mother
but
she
keeps
writin
him
to
be
stayin
in
america
and
that
she
ll
come
to
keep
his
house
as
soon
as
her
duty
s
done
but
she
don
come
for
it
s
this
un
and
that
un
over
thar
that
s
in
need
of
her
ministrin
some
day
i
reckon
barney
ll
pull
up
anchor
and
set
sail
for
his
emerald
oh
rilla
said
with
sudden
tears
in
her
eyes
you
n
me
ll
be
that
lonely
if
he
during
the
morning
while
muriel
busied
herself
with
making
the
little
irishy
cakes
she
did
not
sing
nor
was
she
thinking
of
gene
beavers
for
all
of
her
thoughts
were
of
her
dear
friend
old
captain
barney
somehow
she
hadn
t
realized
before
how
lonesome
he
must
be
so
far
away
from
kith
and
kin
the
fisherfolk
living
about
him
on
the
dunes
were
not
from
his
country
nor
were
their
interests
his
interests
they
loved
him
but
could
not
understand
him
for
as
sam
peters
had
said
one
day
to
a
group
of
the
wives
how
can
a
body
understand
a
man
with
grey
hair
on
the
top
o
his
head
who
believes
in
the
fairies
muriel
understood
him
and
so
no
wonder
was
it
that
they
two
were
the
closest
of
friends
long
rows
of
pert
looking
little
cakes
with
spiral
peaks
were
on
the
white
pine
shelf
when
cap
n
ezra
heard
the
welcome
call
for
mess
yo
rilly
gal
he
exclaimed
looks
like
a
baker
shop
for
sure
sartin
how
much
a
dozen
are
yo
askin
for
yer
wares
yo
re
to
have
a
dozen
for
the
takin
the
girl
flushed
from
the
heat
of
the
stove
told
him
beamingly
yo
re
share
o
em
is
on
the
table
waitin
yer
comin
so
they
be
the
old
man
declared
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
plate
heaped
with
little
cakes
near
his
place
yo
wouldn
t
be
leavin
yer
ol
out
would
yo
fust
mate
leave
yo
out
the
questioner
seemed
amazed
that
such
a
suggestion
could
be
made
why
if
all
the
folks
in
all
the
world
were
to
go
somewhar
s
else
an
i
still
had
you
i
d
be
that
happy
an
the
girl
said
this
nestled
close
in
the
old
man
s
arms
and
over
her
head
he
wiped
away
a
tear
thunderation
he
exclaimed
gruffly
what
a
tarnal
lot
o
sentiment
sort
of
we
two
folks
do
think
lately
i
reckon
your
s
cruisin
into
his
second
childhood
faster
n
a
full
rigged
schooner
can
sail
ahead
of
a
laughingly
muriel
skipped
to
the
stove
and
carried
the
black
iron
spider
to
the
table
to
serve
captain
ezra
i
reckon
it
s
better
off
we
are
when
we
are
childlike
she
said
then
with
sweet
seriousness
she
added
you
know
the
good
book
tells
that
it
s
only
them
that
becomes
like
a
child
again
that
can
enter
the
kingdom
of
taking
her
place
opposite
the
old
man
the
girl
sat
for
a
moment
looking
out
of
the
open
window
at
the
shining
waters
of
the
bay
i
reckon
it
means
that
we
must
be
trustin
like
a
little
child
is
knowin
our
father
in
heaven
to
take
care
of
us
i
reckon
we
d
ought
to
be
like
little
zoeth
was
the
day
that
wixon
got
mad
an
was
goin
to
cruise
off
and
leave
his
fam
ly
forever
he
was
packin
up
his
kit
sayin
hard
words
all
the
time
when
little
cripple
zoeth
clumped
over
to
him
and
slippin
that
frail
hand
o
his
into
the
big
one
he
said
trustin
like
ma
says
yer
goin
away
forever
but
i
tain
t
so
yo
re
dad
and
yer
wantin
to
take
care
o
me
aren
t
yo
dad
yo
recollect
that
wixon
stayed
and
what
s
more
mis
wixon
she
changed
too
she
stopped
peckin
about
suthin
all
the
time
an
tried
to
figure
out
what
she
could
do
to
make
her
home
happy
an
she
it
i
reckon
that
little
ol
shack
o
the
wixons
is
the
happiest
home
on
the
then
taking
up
her
knife
and
fork
she
added
i
cal
late
that
s
what
the
good
book
means
just
trustin
an
bein
like
a
an
hour
later
captain
ezra
stood
at
the
top
of
the
steep
steps
leading
down
the
cliff
and
watched
while
his
gal
rowed
the
dory
over
toward
the
mainland
the
girl
looked
up
at
the
first
buoy
and
waved
to
the
one
she
loved
most
in
all
the
world
little
sol
was
down
on
the
wharf
and
with
him
were
several
small
boys
and
girls
rather
unkempt
rough
mannered
little
creatures
for
the
wives
of
the
fishermen
hadn
t
much
money
to
spend
and
the
children
were
permitted
to
grow
up
as
untutored
as
water
rats
when
rilla
landed
they
ran
to
her
with
arms
outstretched
rilly
rilly
they
clamored
be
tellin
us
a
story
bout
the
mermaid
that
lived
in
a
cave
an
how
the
tail
on
her
changed
to
two
legs
an
she
was
married
to
a
prince
the
oldest
among
them
concluded
many
a
time
muriel
had
told
them
this
story
i
reckon
i
haven
t
time
today
rilla
said
with
a
quick
glance
at
the
sun
then
suddenly
she
thought
of
something
in
her
basket
there
were
two
packages
in
the
larger
one
there
were
cakes
for
uncle
barney
that
could
not
be
touched
but
in
the
smaller
one
there
were
cakes
which
she
had
planned
leaving
at
the
mullet
cottage
for
gene
after
all
it
was
hardly
fair
when
he
had
all
the
goodies
he
wished
and
these
raggedy
children
almost
never
had
anything
but
fish
and
potatoes
i
cal
late
i
have
time
to
be
givin
yo
each
a
little
cake
muriel
announced
placing
her
basket
on
a
roll
of
tarred
rope
she
opened
the
smaller
package
and
passed
around
the
crispy
little
cakes
and
when
she
saw
the
glow
in
the
eyes
that
looked
up
at
her
she
was
glad
of
her
decision
now
we
ll
be
learnin
the
manners
she
laughingly
told
the
children
who
gazed
at
her
with
wonder
each
of
yo
be
makin
a
bow
and
say
thank
you
a
fine
lady
had
come
to
windy
island
the
summer
before
to
visit
the
light
and
with
her
had
been
a
girl
of
seven
muriel
had
been
baking
cakes
that
day
and
had
given
her
one
to
her
surprise
the
child
had
made
the
prettiest
curtsy
and
had
said
thank
you
miss
whatever
strange
thing
rilla
might
ask
the
children
to
do
they
would
at
least
attempt
it
and
so
holding
fast
with
grimy
fingers
to
the
precious
cakes
they
watched
the
older
girl
as
she
showed
them
how
to
curtsy
then
they
tried
to
do
likewise
the
while
they
piped
out
thank
yo
rilly
now
dearies
allays
do
that
arter
yo
ve
been
given
anythin
nice
she
bade
them
rilly
will
was
the
reply
that
followed
her
but
it
was
rather
muffled
for
the
cakes
were
being
hungrily
devoured
muriel
wished
that
she
could
give
each
child
another
but
she
could
not
open
uncle
barney
s
package
and
so
turning
to
wave
goodbye
she
left
the
wharf
and
set
out
across
the
dunes
in
the
direction
of
the
irishman
s
cabin
chapter
xiii
neighborliness
as
muriel
neared
the
shanty
on
the
sand
dunes
in
which
lived
her
dearly
beloved
friend
captain
barney
she
was
conscious
of
unusual
noises
issuing
therefrom
surely
there
was
some
kind
of
a
commotion
going
on
within
the
humble
dwelling
separating
the
sounds
as
she
approached
she
recognized
one
as
laughter
none
but
linda
wixon
laughed
like
that
then
there
was
the
clumping
of
little
zoeth
s
crutches
and
his
shrill
excited
chatter
this
was
followed
by
a
hammering
and
a
chorus
of
approving
feminine
voices
muriel
hastened
her
steps
it
was
impossible
to
run
in
the
soft
sand
what
can
be
goin
on
in
uncle
barney
s
shack
she
wondered
i
reckon
he
s
givin
a
party
though
i
cal
late
that
isn
t
likely
he
bein
laid
her
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
the
genial
irishman
himself
who
appeared
around
the
corner
of
the
shanty
carrying
an
old
rusty
stovepipe
which
he
had
replaced
with
a
new
one
rilla
noticed
that
he
was
stepping
as
spryly
as
ever
he
had
top
o
the
mornin
to

he
called
it

and
the
heart
o

is
singin
a
melody
like
the
harp

through

halls

soul
of

but
twas
tommy
moore
said

that

for

the
joy

can
only
be
feelin
then
as
they
reached
the
open
front
door
of
the
shack
captain
barney
called
belay

and
be
makin
yer
best
bows

and
caught
her

her
hands
zoeth
was
standing
near
looking
eagerly
up
into
the
face
of
his
beloved
friend
which
of
em
do
you
reckon
is
purtiest
he
queried
then
waited
her
reply
as
though
it
were
a
matter
of
great
importance
muriel
gazed
long
at
the
three
brightly
colored
prints
which
had
been
hung
on
three
sides
of
the
room
i
dunno
honest
she
said
they
re
all
that
beautiful
but
i
sort
o
like

who
had
at
one
time

a
ship
carpenter

busily
hammering
at
one
side
of
the
room
where
a
long
low
window
looked
out
toward
the
sea
that
thar
s
a
my
sam

makin
his

explained
to
muriel

a
beautiful
couch

amongst

fast
nearing

and
so
the
group
turned
admiring
eyes
from
the
pictures
to
the
handiwork
of
sam
peters
make
way
thar
his
wife
was
heard
to
exclaim
a
moment
later
from
the
rear
everyone
turned
to
see
that
portly
woman
approaching
a
somewhat
faded
lounge
cover
dragging
one
fringed
corner
while
four
pillows
of
as
many
different
colors
were
in
her
arms
lindy
and
muriel
sprang
forward
to
assist
her
but
sam
would
permit
them
to
do
nothing
but
hold
the
pillows
while
she
herself
placed
them
at
what
she
believed
to
be
fashionable
angles
then
with
arms
akimbo
she
stood
back
and
admired
the
result
she
was
sure
that
judge
lander
herself
could
not
have
arranged
the
pillows
with
more
artistic
effect
we
d
ought
to
of
us
fix
our
cabins
up
that
fine
she
announced
an
i
m
that
red
s
powerful
han
some
jubal
smalley
remarked
thar
d
ought
to
be
a
plant
settin
on
the
window
sill
just
atop
o
no
one
noticed
when
little
zoeth
slipped
away
but
they
all
saw
him
return
triumphantly
bearing
his
greatest
treasure
a
potted
geranium
which
had
three
scarlet
blossoms
with
cheeks
burning
and
eyes
glowing
the
little
fellow
placed
it
upon
the
window
sill
it
s
for
yer
mither
to
keep
he
said
looking
up
at
the
irishman
who
was
deeply
touched
for
well
he
knew
how
the
little
fellow
had
nursed
the
plant
which
the
year
before
lindy
had
rescued
from
a
rubbish
heap
in
the
summer
colony
out
of
his
savings
captain
barney
had
purchased
from
sol
a
table
and
four
straight
chairs
when
everything
was
shipshape
and
sam
peters
was
packing

somebody
tried
to
say
something
but
it
ended
in
a
sincere
handshaking
and
many
eyes
were
moist
then
muriel
and
her
dear
friend
were
left
alone
with
an
arm
about
the
girl
he
loved
the
old
man
stood
looking
out
at
sea
rilly
gal
he
said
at
last
how
kind
folks

this
world
it
s
a
pleasant
place
to

livin
captain
barney
did
not
realize
that
the
fisher
folk
about
him
were
but
returning
a
bit
of
the
loving
kindness
which
he
had
shown
to
them
in
their
many
hours
of
need
glancing
at
the
clock
he
said
briskly
nigh
two
rilly
gal
yer
uncle
barney
must
be
gettin
ready
for
the
train
up
to
that
evening
when
muriel
was
telling
her
grandfather
all
that
had
happened
she
said
i
dunno
why
tis
but
i
feel
sorto
as
though
things
are
comin
out
different
from
the
way
uncle
barney
s
plannin
i
reckon
that
s
along
of
the
fact
that
he
s
had
his
heart
sot
so
many
times
on
his
old
mither
s
cruisin
over
the
big
pond
but
suthin
allays
kept
her
anchored
seemed
like
on
tother
then
as
the
old
man
rose
he
looked
out
toward
the
darkening
east
storm
s
at
last
rilly
gal
i
swan
i
never
knew
an
equinoxial
to
hold
off
so
long
i
reckon

n
t

here
till
round
about
mornin
then
he
added
i
dunno
why
tis
rilly
gal
but
i
m
sort
o
dreadin
the
big
storm
this
the
girl
shuddered
a
cold
night
wind
was
rising
she
pleaded
let
s
go
in
an
be
readin
in
the
good
every
night
since
the
one
on
which
he
had
cast
hate
out
of
his
heart
the
old
man
had
tried
to
read
from
the
new
testament
to
muriel
and
though
he
stumbled
over
many
of
the
longer
words
the
girl
caught
the
spirit
of
it
and
retold
it
with
her
own
interpretation
chapter
xiv
the
storm
the
expected
storm
arrived
the
next
day
although
not
in
its
usual
fury
however
as
there
was
no
real
need
for
muriel
or
her
grandfather
to
cross
the
bay
which
was
into
choppy
waves
they
remained
in
the
house
queer
the
way
our
reg
lar
crasher
of
a
storm
is
delayin
this
year
captain
ezra
said
on
the
third
night
after
the
rains
began
muriel
who
was
washing
cups
at
the
time
suddenly
whirled
and
throwing
her
arms
about
the
old
man
regardless
of
her
soapy
hands
she
cried
passionately
i
d
be
glad
if
they
never
came
i
don
t
know
why
tis
but
when
the
lightning
zigzags
all
aroun
like
a
sword
of
fire
the
thunder
seems
to
roar
some
day
i
ll
crash
yer
light
that
s
tryin
to
defy
the
old
captain
looked
truly
distressed
rilly
gal
he
said
i
wish
yo
didn
t
take
such
queer
notions
you
re
jest
like
yer
mother
was
before
yo
she
used
to
come
singing
down
from
the
top
o
the
cliff
and
tell
me
yarns
bout
what
the
wind
and
the
waves
had
been
tellin
her
lem
used
to
say
she
d
ought
to
be
sent
somewhar
s
an
taught
to
write
stories
that
d
be
a
good
channel
he
opinioned
to
let
out
the
notions
that
was
cooped
up
in
her
head
an
here
yo
are
jest
like
the
old
man
looked
so
truly
distressed
that
the
girl
exclaimed
contritely
yo
dear
ol
if
it
s
worryin
yo
i
ll
try
to
be
diff
rent
i
might
be
like
lindy
wixon
now
she
don
t
have
any
queer
notions
i
asked
her
once
if
she
wouldn
t
like
to
visit
the
star
that
s
so
bright
in
the
evenin
an
she
stared
like
she
thought
i
was
loony
honest
she
then
stooping
the
girl
laughingly
peered
into
the
troubled
eyes
beneath
the
shaggy
grey
brows
how
would
yo
like
to
change
gals
i
belay
there
fust
mate
that
tack
s
crazier
than
the
then
lifting
a
listening
ear
he
added
the
wind
s
rising
i
reckon
the
big
storm
is
crusin
this
way
arter
but
captain
ezra
was
wrong
for
although
the
wind
blew
a
gale
and
the
leaden
clouds
were
hurled
low
above
the
light
and
the
rain
now
and
then
fell
in
sheets
changing
at
times
to
hail
that
rattled
against
the
windows
still
the
tempest
that
often
came
in
the
fall
was
delayed
perhaps
indeed
as
the
captain
began
to
hope
it
was
not
coming
at
all
that
year
for
whenever
it
had
passed
it
had
taken
its
toll
of
lives
and
boats
however
faithfully
the
warning
light
flashed
its
beacon
rays
out
through
the
storm
there
was
a
week
of
inclement
weather
and
muriel
often
stood
in
the
warm
kitchen
looking
out
across
the
waters
of
the
bay
that
were
sometimes
black
under
the
sudden
squalls
and
sometimes
livid
green
when
the
sun
and
rain
were
struggling
together
for
mastery
but
the
girl
s
thoughts
were
not
of
the
weather
but
of
what
might
be
happening
in
tunkett
in
fancy
she
looked
into
the
newly
adorned
cabin
where
captain
barney
had
lived
alone
for
so
many
years
but
try
as
she
might
she
could
not
picture
there
the
old
mither
he
had
so
yearned
to
see
then
in
imagination
she
visited
the
veranda
of
doctor
winslow
s
home
but
it
was
empty
and
the
windows
of
the
house
were
covered
with
heavy
wooden
blinds
shuddering
she
turned
back
into
the
room
to
find
that
the
fire
in
the
stove
was
dying
down
it
was
cold
that
was
why
she
was
shivering
she
decided
maybe
her
was
right
she
was
becoming
too
fanciful
putting
on
an
armful
of
dry
driftwood
she
began
to
sing
as
she
prepared
the
evening
meal
and
her
old
grandfather
who
came
down
the
spiral
stairs
having
set
the
light
to
whirling
felt
cheered
when
he
heard
the
musical
voice
of
his
the
next
morning
to
the
joy
of
muriel
there
were
only
a
few
vagrant
clouds
in
the
sky
and
the
stars
were
shining
when
she
arose
it
seemed
as
though
never
before
had
there
been
such
a
glory
in
the
east
as
there
was
when
apollo
drove
his
flaming
chariot
the
sun
high
above
the
horizon
once
more
triumphing
over
jupiter
pluvius
the
god
of
rain
but
of
mythology
muriel
as
yet
knew
nothing
what
she
did
know
and
it
set
her
heart
and
voice
to
singing
an
anthem
of
gladness
was
that
the
storm
was
over
and
that
she
might
sail
to
tunkett
and
inquire
after
her
dear
friends
the
old
and
the
new
her
grandfather
too
wished
to
visit
the
store
of
sol
for
the
supply
of
oil
must
be
replenished
it
would
never
do
to
let
it
get
below
a
certain
depth
in
the
great
tank
which
contained
it
for
there
might
come
a
storm
of
unusual
length
and
fury
and
the
light
must
be
kept
burning
muriel
felt
more
optimistic
for
we
are
all
somewhat
mercurial
for
temperament
and
it
is
much
easier
to
believe
that
all
is
well
when
the
sun
is
shining
and
yet
is
not
the
sun
always
shining
just
behind
the
clouds
that
never
last
at
the
wharf
they
parted
the
old
sea
captain
going
at
once
to
the
store
while
muriel
hastened
up
the
main
road
toward
the
home
of
winslow
as
she
neared
it
she
suddenly
stood
still
and
gazed
her
dismay
hardly
able
to
believe
what
she
saw
arter
all
twa
n
t
queer
notions
she
said
in
a
low
voice
twas
true
and
indeed
it
was
the
physician
s
blinds
were
barred
over
the
windows
doctor
winslow
had
received
word
from
the
hospital
in
new
york
over
which
he
presided
that
if
he
would
shorten
his
vacation
this
year
it
would
be
greatly
appreciated
and
as
gene
beavers
had
gained
strength
enough
to
travel
he
had
accompanied
the
physician
miss
brazilla
mullet
from
a
window
of
her
cottage
on
the
other
side
of
the
low
evergreen
hedge
saw
muriel
standing
as
though
stunned
and
she
hurried
out
with
a
letter
gene
beavers
left
it
for
you
rilly
she
said
an
he
wanted
me
to
tell
you
that
he
s
gettin
stronger
an
as
soon
s
he
s
able
to
travel
alone
he
s
comin
back
if
only
for
a
day
to
be
tellin
you
goodbye
but
like
s
not
he
s
told
you
all
that
in
the
then
as
the
air
was
nippy
with
frost
miss
brazilla
hurried
indoors
again
rilla
placed
the
letter
in
the
pocket
of
her
coat
and
walked
back
to
meet
her
grandfather
together
they
had
planned
to
visit
the
cabin
on
the
dunes
and
see
captain
barney
but
they
did
not
go
for
when
muriel
beheld
her
emerging
from
the
store
she
knew
by
his
expression
that
he
too
had
sad
news
to
tell
her
no
need
to
go
to
barney
s
fust
mate
he
said
he
s
not
there
an
the
cabin
s
shut
up
tight
s
a
clam
pears
that
when
he
got
to
boston
and

young

was

the
way
but
she

sent
word
that
she

that

how
it

for

the
girl
declared
but
where
is
uncle
barney
what
did
he
do
rilla
s
voice
was
tremulous
and
eager
he
signed
articles
to
sail
back
on
the
same
boat
as
steward
an
he
had
the
young
priest
write
to
sol
to
shut
up
his
cabin
but
to
leave
things
shipshape
as
he
d
cruise
back
in
the
spring
and
bring
his
ol
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
of
the
girl
and
as
she
held
close
to
his
arm
captain
ezra
felt
her
tremble
we
d
better
be
hurryin
home
she
said
the

an
it
s
gettin
chapter
xv
three
more
girls
upon
reaching
windy
island
that
cold
grey
late
afternoon
muriel
went
at
once
to
her
treasure
cave
to
procure
the
primer
which
her
uncle
lem
had
given
her
and
by
the
aid
of
which
she
could
read
other
books
and
letters
containing
the
simplest
words
this
she
carried
to
her
room
above
the
kitchen
adjoining
the
lighthouse
but
it
was
not
until
the
following
morning
when
her
tasks
were
finished
that
she
was
able
to
slip
away
to
decipher
the
message
from
gene
a
drizzling
rain
was
keeping
them
both
indoors
the
old
captain
never
content
when
he
was
idle
had
brought
to
the
warm
kitchen
a
net
that
he
was
mending
i
m
getting
strong
by
the
day
the
little
letter
told
the
girl
and
the
hope
of
seeing
you
very
soon
again
muriel
good
friend
helps
me
more
than
anything
what
would
the
girls
in
his
home
set
have
thought
could
they
have
seen
that
letter
which
had
been
written
in
the
greatest
sincerity
for
with
none
of
them
did
gene
have
a
serious
friendship
they
knew
him
merely
as
the
always
brother
of
their
favorite
helen
beavers
with
whom
they
bantered
merrily
gene
liked
them
all
well
enough
but
they
wearied
him
with
their
constant
chatter
of
tennis
tournaments
and
teas
and
their
ceaseless
laughter
no
wonder
that
his
pal
david
davison
had
often
said
that
most
girls
seemed
to
be
afflicted
with
giggleitis
but
not
so
muriel
as
gene
sat
alone
hour
after
hour
in
a
hospital
the
windows
of
which
looked
out
across
the
hudson
he
thought
often
of
the
sweet
seriousness
of
the
truly
beautiful
face
of
his
storm
those
hazel
eyes
had
looked
into
his
very
soul
and
how
thankful
he
was
that
he
had
nothing
in
that
soul
that
he
wished
to
conceal
she
had
laughed
now
and
then
spontaneously
joyfully
but
she
was
very
different
from
the
modern
girl
who
laughed
continually
because
she
thought
it
becoming
he
couldn
t
conceive
of
muriel
doing
anything
merely
to
gain
admiration
she
s
a
bully
good
pal
that
s
what
so
is
sis
but
there
aren
t
many
girls
like
those
two
was
his
conclusion
gene
had
still
another
month
of
enforced
vacation
as
the
doctor
had
declared
that
he
would
not
permit
him
to
return
to
college
until
after
the
holidays
under
other
circumstances
the
lad
would
have
fretted
about
this
but
as
it
was
he
knew
that
he
was
actually
eager
to
spend
at
least
the
larger
part
of
that
month
in
tunkett
but
gene
was
not
left
long
alone
for
on
the
very
first
saturday
after
his
arrival
in
the
new
york
hospital
his
sister
helen
and
two
of
her
best
friends
from
the
boarding
school
farther
up
the
hudson
appeared
unexpectedly
to
visit
him
gladys
goodsell
and
faith
morley
were
attractive
maidens
clad
in
fashionably
tailored
suits
with
muffs
to
keep
their
gloved
hands
warm
for
in
spite
of
the
dazzling
brightness
of
the
day
the
air
was
stingingly
cold
oh
brother
helen
protested
when
she
was
told
that
as
soon
as
he
was
stronger
he
was
going
back
to
tunkett
what
you
see
in
that
outlandish
village
then
to
her
friends
she
added
i
went
down
there
one
with
doctor
winslow
who
is
an
old
friend
of
father
s
but
i
can
assure
you
that
i
shall
never
go
again
that
is
not
out
of
season
such
queer
people
as
i
saw
honestly
i
had
to
pinch
myself
to
be
sure
that
i
hadn
t
stepped
into
one
of
joseph
lincoln
s
stories
and
as
for
understanding
what
the
natives
said
well
i
just
couldn
maybe
you
didn
t
try
very
hard
this
from
the
lad
who
was
keeping
his
new
friend
a
secret
in
his
heart
maybe
i
didn
t
was
the
merry
reply
but
if
i
were
going
to
write
a
comic
story
that
s
where
i
d
go
for
my
characters
and
illustrations
girls
i
do
wish
you
might
see
the
clothes
worn
by
the
wives
of
the
fishermen
i
am
sure
the
dressmaker
who
made
them
must
have
come
over
in
the
as
gene
listened
lying
back
among
the
pillows
of
his
he
glanced
at
the
costumes
of
his
fair
visitors
then
turning
he
looked
out
toward
the
hudson
but
it
was
not
the
steely
blue
river
that
he
saw
but
a
girl
in
a
nondescript
calico
dress
with
hair
who
was
ordering
him
to
leave
her
island
looking
back
at
his
sister
he
said
you
are
right
helen
about
the
clothes
they
are
when
at
last
the
girls
arose
helen
leaned
affectionately
over
her
brother
s
i
don
t
know
what
possesses
you
to
want
to
go
to
tunkett
of
all
places
during
this
coming
then
wheedlingly
we
re
going
to
have
a
series
of
parties
at
the
school
just
before
the
holidays
and
then
there
s
to
be
that
annual
affair
over

he
said
then
added
but
i
m
hardly
in
trim
for
night
frolics
just
helen
noticed
how
pale
and
suddenly
weary
her
brother
looked
and
stooping
she
kissed
him
tenderly
on
the
forehead
as
she
said
softly
gene
dear
if
you

still
in
tunkett

there
and

christmas
with
you
since
mother
and

in
europe
you
and
i
will
want
to
be
there
was
a
grateful
expression
in
the
lad
s
eyes
and
then
he
closed
them
for
he
found
that
he
was
indeed
very
tired
helen
motioned
the
girls
to
leave
quietly
which
they
did
what
would
these
three
city
maidens
have
thought
had
they
known
gene
s
real
reason
for
wishing
to
return
to
tunkett
for
surely
the
village
itself
held
little
to
attract
one
in
the
severe
months
of
early
winter
chapter
xvi
an
expected
surprise
the
weather
clerk
may
have
been
purposely
perplexing
during
those
first
days
of
december
for
after
having
imprisoned
rilla
and
her
grandfather
on
windy
island
for
two
long
inclement
weeks
they
awakened
one
morning
to
find
a
gleaming
blue
sky
that
merged
on
the
far
horizon
with
the
deeper
turquoise
of
the
ocean
a
fortnight
had
passed
since
she
had
received
the
letter
from
gene
and
yet
he
had
not
come
because
of
the
rains
rilla
and
her
grandfather
had
not
again
visited
the
town
there
was
oil
enough
in
the
tank
to
last
another
month
nor
was
there
anyone
in
tunkett
whom
they
wished
to
see
of
course
there
had
been
no
mail
for
little
sol
had
sailed
close
to
the
island
one
day
and
rilla
hailing
him
had
asked
him
to
bring
the
letters
if
any
should
arrive
she
was
expecting
two
one
from
gene
and
one
from
uncle
barney
and
indeed
her
kind
uncle
lem
now
and
then
wrote
to
her
or
sent
a
picture
postcard
of
some
interesting
building
or
park
in
the
great
city
where
he
resided
ten
months
out
of
every
year
but
the
heart
of
rilla
was
filled
with
a
joyful
anticipation
on
that
first
sparkling
day
after
the
storms
as
soon
as
her
tasks
indoors
were
finished
she
called
to
her
shaggy
playfellow
and
donning
her
crimson
tam
and
away
she
raced
toward
the
outer
cliff
there
she
paused
and
seemed
to
be
watching
for
someone
or
something
a
moment
later
her
eyes
gladdened
and
she
leaned
forward
eagerly
a
flock
of
gleaming
seagulls
appeared
and
muriel
taking
from
her
pocket
a
paper
bag
opened
it
and
tossed
a
fragment
of
bread
into
the
air
instantly
there
was
a
rush
of
wings
and
the
birds
circled
and
swooped
about
her
catching
the
bits
of
food
as
they
fell
now
and
then
a
piece
dropped
far
down
the
cliff
and
two
or
three
birds
would
dive
through
the
air
each
hoping
to
be
the
first
to
obtain
it
when
the
bag
was
empty
muriel
turned
to
find
shags
lying
some
distance
back
of
her
his
head
low
on
his
paws
his
limpid
brown
eyes
watching
every
move
that
she
made
muriel
had
taught
him
that
he
must
be
very
quiet
when
she
was
feeding
the
birds
but
when
she
tossed
the
crumpled
bag
out
upon
the
breeze
and
stood
watching
it
fall
into
the
sea
shags
seemed
to
know
that
he
need
be
still
no
longer
leaping
to
his
feet
he
joined
his
mistress
and
then
together
they
raced
along
on
the
top
of
the
cliff
to
the
side
of
the
island
nearest
the
town
again
the
girl
paused
this
time
shading
her
eyes
as
she
gazed
out
over
the
dancing
blue
waters
thar
s
a
sail
comin
shagsie
ol
dog
she
said
but
that
s
nothin
onusual
pears
like
i
m
spectin
somethin
to
happen
every
day
when
it
used
to
be
nothin
ever
happened
much
that
was
different
i
cal
late
that
it
s
some
fisherman
late
in
startin
for
the
outer
ledge
sam
peters
like
as
not
he
s
powerful
shiftless
when
it
comes
to
gettin
but
nevertheless
as
the
girl
sauntered
around
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
toward
the
light
she
glanced
often
at
the
sailboat
which
seemed
to
be
bearing
directly
toward
windy
island
at
last
her
expression
of
hopeful
eagerness
changed
to
one
of
radiant
certainty
shagsie
she
cried
exultantly
it
little
sol
s
boat
arter
all
i
reckon
he
s
fetchin
some
mail
come
on
ol
dog
let
s
race
to
the
the
girl
and
dog
ran
joyfully
along
the
top
of
the
cliff
but
at
the
top
of
the
steep
flight
of
stairs
that
led
to
the
beach
rilla
paused
and
looked
intently
at
the
boat
which
ahead
of
a
brisk
wind
was
scudding
into
port
thar
s
else
in
it
she
said
in
a
low
voice
shagsie
it
gene
beavers
he
s
come
the
passenger
in
little
sol
s
sailboat
was
indeed
the
lad
whom
rilla
had
expected
when
he
landed
on
the
small
and
mossy
dock
over
which
the
waves
often
washed
he
was
met
by
a
girl
whose
beautiful
face
reminded
him
of
sunrise
so
radiant
was
the
expression
shining
there
but
after
little
sol
had
been
paid
and
told
to
return
promptly
at
five
the
girl
s
joy
at
the
arrival
of
her
friend
changed
to
alarm
when
she
noted
how
very
pale
he
was
yo
oughtn
t
to
ve
made
the
v
yage
yet
i
reckon
she
said
yo
look
all
tuckered
out
why
did
uncle
lem
let
yo
come
so
soon
yo
d
ought
t
be
in
bed

that
s
whar
yo
d
ought
t
be
gene
storm
maiden
stop
scolding
me
a
fine
welcome
you
re
giving
me
i
hoped
that
you
might
be
pleased
to
see
me
and
now
i
m
almost
afraid
that
you
re
going
to
set
your
dog
on
this
was
said
teasingly
but
it
was
answered
by
a
reproachful
expression
in
the
clear
hazel
eyes
of
the
girl
then
as
captain
ezra
at
that
moment
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
steep
steps
the
lad
went
up
two
at
a
time
perhaps
with
some
idea
of
showing
muriel
how
strong
he
really
was
but
he
had
overestimated
his
strength
for
when
the
top
was
reached
the
captain
s
strong
arms
were
all
that
kept
him
from
falling
boy
the
old
man
said
what
in
tarnal
creation
are
yo
cruisin
around
for
in
rough
water
wi
yer
mast
broken
and
yer
rudder
gone
the
lad
looked
up
from
the
bench
outside
of
the
light
to
which
the
captain
had
led
him
am
i
that
much
of
a
wreck
he
asked
smiling
whimsically
then
he
confessed
i
believe
i
had
overestimated
my
strength
lying
there
all
day
i
had
no
way
of
telling
how
weak
i
really
was
i
used
to
get
so
tired
of
doing
nothing
and
i
thought
if
only
i
could
get
back
here
where
the
salt
air
is
so
exhilarating
maybe
i
d
get
strong
sooner
but
i
d
better
be
taking
the
train
back
tonight
i
m
muriel
had
gone
at
once
to
the
kitchen
and
had
a
roaring
fire
in
the
stove
and
the
kettle
on
to
boil
when
the
old
man
and
the
lad
entered
how
gene
laughed
a
little
later
when
having
been
made
comfortable
in
a
wooden
rocker
which
had
been
drawn
close
to
the
fire
his
storm
maiden
again
handed
him
a
thick
cup
filled
with
a
steaming
beverage
muriel
he
said
you
and
i
seem
destined
to
have
morning
teas
together
do
you
recall
our
first
one
down
on
the
beach
when
you
threatened
to
shoot
me
the
girl
whirled
about
and
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
then
glancing
at
her
grandfather
whose
back
was
toward
them
she
said
in
a
low
voice
don
tell
that
i
don
know
what
possessed
me
that
day
i
reckon
i
was
that
angered
bein
as
yo
wouldn
t
take
i
ll
mind
you
from
now
on
forever
after
muriel
good
friend
the
lad
began
then
added
with
sudden
seriousness
i
realize
from
my
recent
misadventures
that
i
am
not
possessed
of
any
too
sound
a
a
happy
day
they
had
although
gene
spent
nearly
all
of
it
in
the
rocker
near
the
fire
as
the
clock
chimed
the
hour
of
four
the
lad
arose
as
he
said
i
ought
to
be
getting
back
to
town
i
would
better
take
the
evening
train
captain
ezra
gently
pushed
the
lad
down
into
the
chair
tarnation
sakes
he
exclaimed
do
yo
reckon
i
d
let
a
friend
of
doctor
lem
s
leave
this
craft
with
underpinnin
s
as
shaky
as
yours
are
not
by

long
sight
yo
oughtn
t
to

come
but
bein
as
yo
re
here
yo
re
goin
to

the
boy
confessed
but
doctor
winslow
does
not
even
know
that
i
came
he
was
to
be
gone
for
a
few
days
and
so
the
old
sea
captain
grunted
he
ll
know
soon
enough
when
little
sol
comes
give
him
a
message
for
his
ma
to
wire
back
to
the
big
city
tell
doctor
lem
that
yo
re
goin
to
try
rilla
s
nursin
for
a
if
there
was
a
twinkle
in
the
grey
eyes
of
the
old
man
there
was
also
a
heaviness
in
his
heart
chapter
xvii
the
blue
jewels
gene
beavers
received
a
from
doctor
winslow
on
the
following
day
and
it
contained
its
full
quota
of
words
the
sentiment
of
it
was
you
scamp
you
ought
to
be
well
chastised
for
running
away
but
after
all
nurse
rilla

be
able

so
that
you
may
be
of
use
if
the
need
may
i
gene
asked
looking
up
eagerly
from
the
letter
into
the
face
of
the
old
man
who
sat
near
the
stove
cap
pulled
well
down
over
his
eyes
smoking
hard
on
his
corncob
pipe
there
was
a
struggle
going
on
in
the
heart
of
captain
ezra
here
was
one
of
those
city
chaps
who
for
years
he
had
hated
on
general
principles
settling
down
in
his
home
it
would
seem
to
be
a
boarder
for
an
indefinite
length
of
time
then
another
thought
presented
itself
as
the
captain
noticed
how
frail
the
lad
really
was
and
he
questioned
his
own
heart
what
if
twas
yo
re
boy
needin
to
help
him
get
strong
ezra
bassett
how
would
yo
want
him
to
be
treated
turned
out
and
let
to
drift
on
the
rocks
maybe
i
the
old
man
rose
and
vigorously
shook
the
ashes
down
from
the
stove
before
he
replied
sure
yo
can
be
larnin
all
thar
is
to
know
about
the
light
i
reckon
if
twould
interest
yo
son
but
lem
knows
i
m
jealous
of
that
big
lamp
i
won
t
even
let
rilly
gal
polish
up
the
the
girl
her
face
flushed
from
the
heat
of
the
stove
where
she
stood
frying
fish
and
potatoes
in
a
big
black
skillet
laughed
over
her
shoulder
as
she
said
i
reckon
loves
the
lamp
better
n
he
does
me
i
reckon
he
does
then
it
was
that
the
expression
of
infinite
tenderness
which
gene
had
noticed
before
appeared
in
the
eyes
of
the
old
man
as
he
replied
earnestly
thar
s
nothin
this
world
holds
that
i
love
better
n
you
fust
mate
then
he
added
in
another
tone
an
you
rascal
you
know
gene
slept
on
a
cot
in
the
kitchen
and
as
the
days
passed
his
strength
rapidly
returned
the
weather
continued
sunny
and
bracing
and
although
it
was
nearing
the
holiday
season
the
midwinter
blizzards
had
not
arrived
muriel
had
told
the
lad
all
about
the
treasure
box
in
her
cave
a
week
after
the
arrival
of
the
boy
on
windy
island
they
were
climbing
about
on
the
cliffs
when
they
found
themselves
near
the
small
opening
to
the
cave
come
on
in
i
ll
show
yo
the
box
rilla
said
gene
really
curious
concerning
the
treasure
that
had
been
given
up
by
the
sea
went
in
and
watched
with
interest
as
the
girl
lifted
the
cover
of
what
he
recognized
to
be
a
steamer
trunk
of
foreign
make
the
dress
he
agreed
was
wonderful
i
judge
that
it
is
parisian
he
said
then
as
he
saw
the
question
in
her
hazel
eyes
he
told
about
the
city
of
paris
where
he
had
been
the
summer
before
he
described
the
beautiful
shops
the
lights
the
damsels
and
the
rare
and
exquisite
fabrics
from
which
their
gowns
were
fashioned
i
reckon
this
box
belongs
to
one
of
those
beautiful
ladies
muriel
said
at
last
gene
nodded
i
haven
t
a
doubt
about
it
he
agreed
have
you
looked
through
it
thoroughly
to
see
if
you
could
find
the
name
of
the
owner
the
girl
shook
her
head
i
cal
lated
thar
d
been
a
wreck
for
twas
a
high
storm
as
sent
this
box
in
twa
n
t
hereabouts
but
i
reckon
it
was
far
out
at
undoubtedly
you
are
right
muriel
but
let
s
look
for
some
possible
clue
as
to
the
former
owner
s
the
lad
and
the
girl
as
eager
as
two
children
were
on
their
knees
in
the
soft
sand
of
the
cave
the
dress
had
been
carefully
laid
to
one
side
a
small
box
of
exquisite
workmanship
was
found
and
when
the
cover
was
lifted
the
girl
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
and
in
the
dim
light
gene
thought
her
eyes
like
stars
no
wonder
that
muriel
was
elated
for
in
that
box
there
was
a
set
of
jewels
of
the
most
entrancing
blue
never
had
she
seen
anything
just
like
it
in
the
sea
or
in
the
sky
it
seemed
to
be
alive
that
color
there
was
a
necklace
of
them
and
two
earrings
a
brooch
and
a
ring
muriel
gazed
at
them
awed
by
their
loveliness
her
hands
tight
clasped
as
gene
watched
her
he
wished
that
all
girls
might
be
as
utterly
unconscious
of
self
as
she
was
not
a
move
did
she
ever
make
to
attract
him
she
was
as
natural
in
all
that
she
did
as
were
the
seagulls
that
circled
over
the
cliff
his
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
muriel
who
looked
up
with
a
troubled
expression
in
her
eyes
gene
she
said
tisn
t
right
for
me
to
keep
em
they
aren
t
mine
and
i
cal
late
they
re
wurth
a

the

nodded
a
fortune
i
i
d
like
to
give
em
back
to
the

if
i
knew
who

had
idly
lifted
from
the
jewel
case
a
locket
and
had
opened
it
on
one
side
was
the
portrait
of
a
proud
beautiful
girl
and
on
the
other
was
a
picture
of
himself
he
snapped
it
shut
and
replacing
it
in
the
box
he
rose
rather
abruptly
saying
muriel
let
s
finish
our
search
for
the
owner
s
name
at
some
future
time
shall
we
you
know
we
started
out
to
dig
muriel
was
rather
surprised
but
as
her
patient
did
seem
weary
she
replaced
the
green
dress
and
went
with
him
to
the
beach
below
gene
wanted
time
to
think
chapter

memories
the
next
morning
captain
ezra
asked
gene
if
he
would
like
to
go
to
the
outer
ledge
and
spend
the
day
fishing
as
the
supply
in
the
barrel
was
getting
low
the
lad
was
glad
to
go
and
as
muriel
had
baking
to
do
she
was
equally
pleased
to
be
alone
long
silent
hours
these
were
for
gene
as
he
sat
with
the
captain
waiting
for
the
coming
of
the
fish
that
seemed
reluctant
to
be
caught
in
the
early
morning
long
thoughtful
hours
now
and
then
the
lad
even
forgot
where
he
was
until
a
wave
larger
than
the
others
rocked
the
boat
and
recalled
to
him
his
whereabouts
he
was
living
over
again
a
chapter
in
his
past
it
had
happened
the
summer
before
his
dear
mother
who
was
perfect
in
every
other
way
had
one
obsession
many
mothers
seemed
to
have
it
he
concluded
and
that
was
that
she
wanted
the
idol
of
her
heart
her
only
son
to
make
a
fashionable
marriage
during
their
last
vacation
with
his
sister
helen
he
had
joined
his
parents
in
paris
where
beavers
was
employed
as
resident
representative
of
large
american
interests
he
himself
having
a
controlling
share
beavers
had
suggested
a
jaunt
about
the
continent
and
had
joined
a
small
exclusive
party
one
of
the
younger
members
of
it
being
just
the
sort
of
a
girl
she
desired
as
a
comrade
for
her
son
marianne
carnot
the
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
illustrious
french
folk
had
been
educated
in
london
and
although
she
was
a
dark
sparkling
beauty
of
the
french
type
she
spoke
excellent
english
with
a
delightful
accent
which
but
added
to
her
charm
gene
s
mother
in
her
eagerness
to
interest
her
son
in
this
girl
for
monsieur
carnot
was
a
diplomat
of
fabulous
wealth
had
been
truly
discouraged
for
they
had
neither
of
them
cared
greatly
or
so
it
would
seem
to
be
in
each
other
s
company
when
the
pleasant
journey
through
italy
switzerland
and
france
was
ended
beavers
could
not
see
that
the
two
most
frequently
in
her
thoughts
had
been
greatly
impressed
with
each
other
they
had
come
to
the
parting
of
their
ways
and
gene
had
never
again
seen
marianne
nor
had
they
corresponded
but
the
locket
how
had
marianne
procured
the
snapshot
of
him
then
he
recalled
one
day
in
rome
when
she
had
told
him
to
stand
by
a
famous
statue
and
look
his
prettiest
he
had
supposed
that
a
photograph
of
the
statue
was
what
she
had
really
wished
to
procure
but
he
had
been
mistaken
evidently
could
it
have
been
that
marianne
had
liked
him
especially
he
was
sure
that
this
was
not
true
he
also
recalled
that
his
mother
had
assured
mademoiselle
carnot
that
she
ought
to
spend
at
least
one
year
in
an
american
boarding
school
evidently
the
french
girl
had
been
voyaging
across
the
great
atlantic
when
her
small
steamer
trunk
had
been
lost
did
that
mean
that
marianne
had
also
met
with
disaster
he
decided
that
he
would
write
his
sister
at
once
and
inquire
if
she
knew
aught
of
her
friend
of
the
summer
before
when
gene
reached
windy
island
that
night
upon
one
thing
he
had
decided
he
would
tell
muriel
the
entire
story
the
next
morning
an
opportunity
presented
itself
the
girl
was
darning
in
the
sunny
kitchen
when
gene
came
in
from
the
shed
on
the
shore
where
he
and
captain
ezra
had
been
cleaning
fish
and
packing
it
away
in
the
barrel
which
was
kept
very
cold
in
a
wet
hole
in
the
sand
muriel
looked
up
with
a
welcoming
smile
just
such
a
smile
was
ever
awaiting
the
coming
of
her
gene
sat
upon
the
broad
arm
of
a
chair
nearby
and
twirled
his
cap
muriel
good
friend
he
said
i
know
to
whom
your
box
the
girl
looked
up
amazed
not
understanding
gene
how
could
yo
we
didn
t
find
a
name
or
nothin
yes
we
found
something
that
is
i
those
hazel
eyes
were
again
looking
into
the
very
soul
of
the
boy
but
he
did
not
flinch
he
had
done
nothing
of
which
he
was
ashamed
he
slid
down
into
the
chair
and
leaning
forward
looked
directly
back
at
her
i
didn
t
tell
you
at
once
because
i
wanted
to
think
it
all
over
i
was
so
surprised
i
couldn
t
quite
understand
myself
what
it
could
mean
but
i
do
now
in
part
at
least
may
i
tell
you
the
story
the
girl
nodded
and
her
hands
lay
idly
in
her
lap
though
still
holding
the
sock
she
had
been
darning
gene
told
her
all
from
the
beginning
he
wondered
what
her
first
remark
would
be
when
he
paused
it
was
i
reckon
yo
re
mother
wouldn
t
wish
yo
to
be
friends
with
me
gene
beavers
i
cal
late
yo
d
better
go
back
to
the
city
soon
to
the
kind
of
folks
she
d
want
yo
to
be
associatin
nonsense
muriel
the
lad
had
risen
and
thrusting
his
hands
deep
in
his
pockets
he
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
for
a
long
time
silent
thoughtful
chapter
xix
the
owner
of
the
box
they
did
not
again
visit
the
box
in
treasure
cave
as
he
had
planned
gene
had
written
a
long
letter
to
his
sister
telling
her
that
he
was
getting
strong
and
well
describing
his
interesting
life
on
windy
island
but
muriel
for
some
reason
he
did
not
mention
he
ended
his
epistle
by
telling
his
sister
about
the
small
steamer
trunk
which
had
been
cast
ashore
by
a
storm
and
then
asked
if
helen
had
heard
lately
from
marianne
carnot
a
week
passed
and
no
reply
was
received
gene
growing
every
day
more
rugged
and
ruddy
had
actually
forgotten
that
his
sister
had
said
if
he
did
not
return
to
new
york
to
spend
the
holidays
with
her
that
she
would
visit
him
it
was
a
glorious
day
about
a
week
before
christmas
and
the
air
was
invigoratingly
cold
i
ll
race
yo
around
the
island
on
the
beach
muriel
called
as
she
and
gene
started
out
for
their
customary
morning
hike
when
their
tasks
were
finished
you
won
t
beat
the
boy
whose
laughing
face
was
beginning
to
bronze
from
the
sun
and
wind
shouted
that
his
voice
might
be
heard
above
the
booming
of
the
surf
on
the
rocks
near
won
t
i
muriel
turned
merrily
to
defy
him
i
snum
you
won
t
gene
liked
to
borrow
words
from
the
old
sea
captain
s
lingo
now
and
then
nor
will
i
for
that
matter
the
lad
confessed
shags
will
now
one
two
three
go
away
they
ran
muriel
was
quickly
in
the
lead
shags
bounding
at
her
heels
and
the
lad
a
close
third
when
they
reached
the
north
end
of
the
island
they
found
that
the
tide
was
high
which
meant
that
they
had
to
await
the
receding
of
the
waves
before
they
could
round
the
point
on
the
sand
luck
was
with
muriel
for
when
she
reached
the
rocks
there
was
a
clear
wet
space
ahead
of
her
and
around
she
darted
but
gene
was
held
up
while
another
breaker
crashed
in
and
so
as
they
neared
their
final
goal
the
little
wharf
on
the
town
side
of
the
island
the
girl
was
in
the
lead
her
hair
was
blown
her
cheeks
were
flushed
her
eyes
sparkling
and
as
she
whirled
to
exult
over
the
lad
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
more
beautiful
picture
he
caught
both
of
her
hands
but
his
bantering
remark
died
as
he
stared
at
the
dock
back
of
muriel
hardly
able
to
believe
his
eyes
my
sister
helen
has
come
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
someone
is
with
instantly
he
recognized
the
someone
it
was
marianne
carnot
i
ll
go
back
to
the
light
muriel
told
him
yo
re
sister
ll
want
to
see
yo
alone
an
she
won
t
care
for
the
like
o
gene
leaped
to
her
side
when
the
girl
turned
away
muriel
storm
he
said
and
there
was
a
note
of
ringing
sincerity
in
his
voice
you
are
a
princess
compared
to
most
girls
come
with
me
please
to
greet
my
she
went
reluctantly
she
recalled
what
he
had
told
her
about
his
mother
wishing
him
to
care
for
this
french
girl
of
wealth
and
family
and
his
sister
helen
would
probably
feel
the
same
way
perhaps
they
would
not
be
kind
to
her
how
she
wanted
to
run
up
to
the
light
to
the
sheltering
arms
of
her
grandfather
but
gene
held
her
hand
in
a
firm
clasp
until
they
reached
the
top
of
the
steps
leading
to
the
small
wharf
then
releasing
her
he
went
to
greet
the
newcomers
turning
at
once
to
introduce
muriel
there
was
indeed
a
curling
of
the
lips
and
a
slight
if
almost
imperceptible
lifting
of
the
eyebrows
but
the
storm
maiden
in
muriel
had
awakened
and
it
was
with
a
proudly
held
head
that
she
said
miss
carnot
i
m
that
glad
to
be
able
to
return
yo
re
box
if
tis
yo
r
it
is
indeed
mine
marianne
replied
haughtily
i
will
bid
the
man
who
rowed
us
over
to
get
it
if
you
will
tell
him
where
it
is
later
you
shall
receive
the
reward
which
my
father
offered
for
the
return
of
my
muriel
her
cheeks
burning
was
nevertheless
about
to
comply
when
gene
leaped
forward
saying
i
will
show
the
oarsman
where
the
trunk
is
rilla
you
need
not
luckily
at
that
moment
the
island
girl
heard
her
grandfather
s
voice
booming
her
name
from
the
door
of
the
light
gene
heard
it
too
and
he
was
glad
that
it
offered
his
storm
maiden
an
escape
from
further
humiliation
which
he
was
powerless
to
prevent
later
when
the
trunk
had
been
placed
in
the
boat
and
when
marianne
was
looking
through
its
contents
to
be
sure
that
nothing
had
been
removed
or
ruined
helen
took
the
opportunity
of
speaking
alone
with
her
brother
she
was
truly
glad
to
note
that
his
health
had
been
restored
and
she
implored
him
to
return
with
her
for
the
holidays
surely
brother
helen
said
you
are
strong
enough
now
and
since
it
was
to
gain
your
strength
that
you
came
why
should
you
remain
any
longer
gladys
and
faith
told
me
not
to
return
without
you
they
both
like
to
dance
with
you
and
marianne
i
know
has
been
eager
to
see
you
she
is
hurt
i
can
tell
because
you
pay
her
so
little
attention
then
glancing
toward
the
lighthouse
where
muriel
was
standing
close
to
her
helen
added
in
a
lower
voice
of
course
i
know
there
is
nothing
serious
in
this
companionship
gene
but
what
would
our
mother
say
what
indeed
of
course
i
shall
be
returning
soon
was
all
that
he
would
say
as
i
want
to
be
back
at
college
by
the
beginning
of
the
winter
gene
spent
a
long
thoughtful
hour
alone
on
the
cliff
when
his
sister
and
the
proud
marianne
were
gone
muriel
was
busy
preparing
the
noon
meal
but
she
too
was
thoughtful
her
friend
was
well
enough
now
to
return
to
the
city
and
ought
she
not
urge
him
to
go
just
before
the
visitors
had
been
rowed
over
to
tunkett
helen
had
ascended
the
flight
of
stairs
leading
to
the
light
and
taking
the
hand
of
the
girl
who
lived
there
she
had
said
almost
pleadingly
won
t
you
please
advise
my
brother
to
come
home
for
the
holidays
i
can
t
stay
with
him
here
and
it
s
going
to
be
so
lonely
for
me
with
mother
and
father
away
i
would
go
to
them
but
the
vacation
at
midwinter
will
be
too
there
were
tears
in
the
eyes
that
looked
at
muriel
with
the
same
frank
candid
expression
that
was
also
her
brother
s
i
reckon
he
should
be
goin
muriel
had
answered
i
cal
late
he
s
strong
enough
now
and
he
ll
be
wantin
to
get
back
to
college
arter
a
helen
had
smiled
her
gratitude
and
pressing
the
slim
brown
hand
that
she
held
in
her
own
that
was
gloved
she
had
said
hurriedly
thank
you
miss
muriel
please
don
t
tell
brother
that
i
made
this
request
he
might
feel
that
i
was
then
she
had
added
i
know
mother
would
wish
helen
ever
considerate
and
kind
did
not
mean
what
muriel
believed
that
she
did
there
was
a
deep
crimson
flush
in
the
cheeks
of
the
island
girl
but
just
at
that
moment
marianne
had
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
coldly
announce
that
she
was
ready
to
depart
i
m
coming
helen
had
called
then
because
she
was
too
much
like
her
brother
not
to
ring
true
she
held
out
her
hand
again
to
muriel
and
had
said
most
sincerely
i
want
to
thank
you
and
your
grandfather
for
having
done
so
much
toward
restoring
gene
s
health
i
reckon
i
ll
be
glad
when
they
re
all
gone
muriel
thought
the
flush
again
creeping
to
her
cheeks
if
an
i
aren
t
good
enough
to
be
associated
with
i
cal
late
when
gene
comes
in
i
ll
tell
him
he
must
be
goin
a
moment
later
she
heard
his
clear
merry
whistle
as
he
rounded
the
house
to
his
surprise
when
he
entered
the
kitchen
she
did
not
turn
to
greet
him
with
her
usual
friendly
smile
had
those
girls
made
his
storm
maiden
was
his
first
almost
wrathful
thought
throwing
his
cap
to
a
chair
near
he
leaped
to
the
kitchen
table
where
the
girl
stood
busily
stirring
a
cornmeal
mixture
for
baking
the
lad
saw
the
flushed
cheeks
and
at
once
he
understood
catching
her
hands
regardless
of
the
spoon
he
whirled
her
about
storm
maiden
he
said
what
did
marianne
carnot
say
that
has
hurt
you
he
felt
as
a
brother
might
he
assured
himself
a
desire
to
fight
the
world
to
defend
this
girl
the
quivering
lips
smiled
just
a
little
she
didn
t
say
nothin
then
rilla
added
gene
i
ve
been
ponderin
while
yo
ve
been
out
an
i
reckon
yo
d
better
go
back
to
the
city
now
i
cal
late
how
she
dreaded
to
hurt
him
but
she
had
decided
that
he
must
go
but
she
did
not
have
to
finish
the
sentence
gene
turned
away
and
took
up
his
cap
very
well
muriel
he
said
i
promised
to
mind
every
command
and
if
this
is
one
of
them
i
ll
go
captain
ezra
secretly
rejoiced
when
he
heard
that
the
lad
was
soon
to
depart
it
was
hard
for
him
to
share
his
he
liked
gene
to
be
sure
better
than
he
did
any
boy
he
had
ever
known
in
fact
he
hadn
t
supposed
city
folk
could
be
so
genuine
willing
to
clean
fish
or
turn
a
hand
to
anything
however
commonplace
to
be
sure
doctor
winslow
might
be
called
city
folks
for
he
had
spent
most
of
his
time
in
new
york
for
nearly
thirty
years
but
when
all
was
said
he
was
really
a
native
of
tunkett
muriel
tried
to
laugh
and
chatter
during
the
meal
that
followed
but
gene
found
it
hard
to
do
so
he
was
still
feeling
rebellious
he
was
so
sure
marianne
carnot
had
hurt
his
storm
she
should
have
remained
in
europe
if
she
does
not
approve
of
american
democracy
his
indignant
thought
was
declaring
but
in
muriel
she
has
met
her
superior
another
thought
championed
adding
i
hope
the
future
will
prove
it
and
humiliate
her
after
gene
s
departure
the
delayed
blizzard
arrived
with
unusual
fury
the
mountainous
waves
crashed
against
the
rocks
as
though
determined
to
undermine
the
light
high
on
the
cliff
above
them
but
when
each
fuming
frothing
wave
had
receded
the
tower
strong
and
unshaken
stood
in
the
midst
of
driving
hail
and
wet
snow
but
its
efforts
to
shine
were
of
little
avail
for
its
great
lamp
could
merely
cast
a
halo
of
glow
and
a
small
circle
of
light
out
into
the
storm
woe
to
the
mariners
if
any
there
were
who
went
too
near
the
outer
ledge
while
the
blizzard
raged
rilly
gal
i
cal
late
yer
city
friend
got
away
jest
in
time
captain
ezra
said
on
the
third
day
of
the
blizzard
which
had
continued
with
unabated
fury
it
d
be
tarnal
risky
navigatin
tryin
to
cruise

over
to
tunkett

which
was
when

by
the
stove
smoking
it
was
warm
and
cheerful
in
the
kitchen
but
with
each
fresh
blast
of
wind
the
house
shook
while
the
very
island
itself
seemed
to
tremble
now
and
then
as
an
unusually
large
wave
crashed
over
it
on
the
seaward
side
muriel
turned
to
look
out
of
the
window
toward
the
town
but
all
that
she
could
see
was
the
grey
sleeting
rain
turning
back
into
the
warm
kitchen
she
took
her
darning
basket
and
sat
near
the
stove
after
a
thoughtful
moment
she
spoke
i

at
the

man
whom
she
loved
then
rolling
two
socks
together
she
arose
to
prepare
the
noon
meal
the
captain
tilted
back
his
chair
the
sermon
now
bein
concluded
he
announced
it
s
time
for
the
singin
in
a
clear
sweet
voice
muriel
sang
his
favorite
of
the
hymns
peace
and
joy
were
within
that
humble
home
while
the
tempest
raged
without
but
that
night
when
she
was
snug
in
her
bed
in
her
room
over
the
kitchen
muriel
lay
awake
for
a
long
time
listening
to
the
roar
of
the
storm
and
the
crash
of
the
surf
and
tried
to
picture
what
her
friend
gene
was
doing
at
that
hour
but
his
world
was
not
her
world
and
the
island
girl
could
not
even
imagine
the
gayety
into
which
helen
and
gladys
and
faith
had
lured
him
that
new
year
s
eve
chapter
xx
new
year
s
eve
the
street
lights
in
new
york
were
barely
distinguishable
because
of
the
storm
which
raged
for
many
miles
north
and
south
along
the
atlantic
coast
there
were
few
pedestrians
out
although
it
was
still
early
evening
and
but
a
scattering
of
closed
vehicles
in
one
of
these
sat
helen
beavers
marianne
carnot
and
gene
the
french
girl
shivered
and
drew
her
costly
grey
furs
closer
about
her
so
this
is
your
winter
she
said
i
would
like
it
better
in
the
south
where
it
is
always
she
shrugged
her
slim
shoulders
and
tried
to
peer
out
of
the
small
window
the
skidding
car
was
turning
into
a
fashionable
side
street
soon
they
were
gliding
up
the
drive
of
a
private
residence
they
stopped
under
a
wide
sheltering
portico
and
when
the
door
was
flung
aside
gene
leaped
to
the
pavement
to
help
the
girls
alight
brights
lights
burned
within
a
handsome
grey
stone
house
and
a
moment
later
the
door
was
opened
to
admit
them
into
a
festive
scene
where
there
was
youth
and
music
laughter
and
joy
it
was
the
home
of
faith
morley
s
aunt
louise
and
this
was
one
of
the
parties
to
attend
which
the
girls
had
begged
gene
to
return
to
the
big
city
an
hour
later
when
he
had
danced
first
with
faith
his
hostess
and
then
with
helen
and
gladys
goodsell
he
went
in
search
of
marianne
whom
he
found
talking
with
a
tall
lank
youth
in
military
uniform
the
proud
girl
paid
scant
attention
to
the
newcomer
gene
knowing
that
it
was
his
duty
if
not
his
pleasure
to
ask
each
of
his
sister
s
friends
to
dance
with
him
waited
until
there
was
a
pause
in
their
conversation
before
making
the
request
the
french
girl
thanked
him
effusively
of
course
but
declined
saying
that
she
did
not
dance
the
american
waltz
then
she
turned
back
to
the
young
cadet
who
if
the
truth
were
known
was
boring
her
exceedingly
gene
excused
himself
and
seemingly
unnoticed
walked
away
the
slow
dreamy
waltz
music
was
being
played
by
the
orchestra
and
as
it
was
the
only
dance
for
which
gene
cared
he
sought
his
sister
but
was
just
in
time
to
see
her
glide
away
with
his
pal
david
davison
he
did
not
care
to
dance
with
anyone
else
he
felt
too
weary
to
be
entertaining
and
so
he
slipped
across
the
hall
into
the
dimly
lighted
library
where
a
log
was
burning
on
the
wide
hearth
casting
its
warm
glow
over
the
low
bookshelves
and
the
statues
and
beautiful
paintings
he
was
glad
no
one
was
there
he
wanted
to
be
alone
to
rest
he
assured
himself
but
what
he
really
wished
was
to
remember
he
sank
down
into
the
big
comfortable
chair
in
front
of
the
fire
which
had
recently
been
deserted
by
morley
an
open
book
and
a
magazine
lay
nearby
how
good
it
seemed
to
be
away
from
the
noise
if
laughter
and
chatter
and
music
could
be
called
by
a
name
so
plebian
then
he
listened
to
the
other
sounds
as
he
sank
deeper
into
the
soft
depths
of
the
chair
and
relaxed
stretching
out
before
the
warmth
of
the
blaze
how
the
storm
whistled
and
moaned
about
the
house
and
down
the
chimney
closing
his
eyes
he
tried
to
picture
what
the
storm
would
be
like
about
tunkett
he
glanced
at
the
small
clock
over
the
mantle
the
house
adjoining
the
tower
would
be
in
darkness
but
the
great
lamp
would
be
swinging
perhaps
the
blizzard
was
keeping
muriel
awake
and
he
wondered
what
she
might
be
thinking
about
just
then
he
happened
to
recall
what
his
sister
had
said
to
him
that
morning
and
knowing
helen
he
also
knew
that
she
had
meant
it
kindly
putting
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
she
had
looked
into
his
eyes
saying
dear
brother
you
wouldn
t
allow
yourself
to
care
for
someone
of
whom
your
mother
could
not
be
proud
this
friend
of
yours
muriel
storm
is
a
fine
girl
i
am
sure
but
she
could
not
associate
with
your
friends
and
our
mother
s
heart
would
be
broken
if
you
really
cared
for
of
course
he
and
muriel
did
not
care
for
each
other
in
the
way
to
which
helen
had
referred
they
were
just
jolly
good
why
were
people
always
romancing
he
was
glad
that
muriel
did
not
fit
into
the
scene
that
was
being
enacted
in
the
brilliantly
lighted
room
across
the
hall
he
liked
her
best
as
she
was
at
midnight
his
sister
found
him
and
her
glance
was
reproachful
at
first
but
when
she
saw
how
truly
weary
he
looked
she
rebuked
herself
for
having
kept
him
up
late
so
soon
after
his
illness
she
remembered
how
solicitous
muriel
had
been
that
he
should
not
overwork
was
she
helen
less
considerate
as
a
sister
than
this
island
girl
as
a
friend
when
they
were
again
in
the
closed
car
marianne
retired
into
the
depth
of
her
furs
and
ignored
their
existence
pretending
that
she
was
too
weary
for
conversation
but
helen
understood
marianne
she
knew
wished
all
boys
to
think
her
the
most
charming
girl
they
had
ever
met
and
though
gene
was
polite
he
had
not
been
devoted
poor
brother
helen
thought
as
she
glanced
at
his
face
pale
in
spite
of
its
recent
tanning
aloud
she
said
gene
this
is
the
last
night
that
i
am
going
to
drag
you
around
to
a
dance
i
know
that
you
ought
to
just
rest
if
you
are
to
go
back
to
college
next
gene
said
nothing
but
reached
for
his
sister
s
hand
and
held
it
in
a
loving
clasp
chapter
xxi
christmas
in
february
it
was
the
first
week
in
february
before
captain
ezra
thought
it
wise
for
him
to
cross
the
turbulent
waters
of
the
bay
it
was
indeed
necessary
for
him
to
make
the
voyage
then
as
the
oil
had
dropped
to
what
he
called
low
tide
mark
and
after
that
the
faithful
keeper
of
the
light
never
delayed
longer
than
necessary
before
refilling
the
tank
the
wind
had
subsided
and
the
sun
came
out
revealing
the
island
white
with
drifts
of
snow
and
too
there
was
ice
on
the
stairs
leading
down
to
the
little
wharf
the
muriel
upon
hearing
her
say
that
he
must
go
down
and
get
the
dory
out
of
the
boathouse
skipped
ahead
with
a
kettle
of
boiling
water
and
after
thawing
the
ice
swept
the
steps
dry
that
her
might
not
slip
the
old
man
coming
out
of
the
house
just
then
his
fur
cap
drawn
over
his
ears
and
his
red
knitted
muffler
tied
about
his
neck
looked
lovingly
at
the
girl
who
always
seemed
to
be
planning
something
for
his
comfort
or
happiness
why
just
then
he
should
have
thought
of
muriel
s
father
whom
he
had
robbed
as
barney
put
it
he
could
not
have
told
what
that
father
had
lost
no
one
knew
better
than
captain
ezra
ho
rilly
gal
yo
ve
swabbed
the
decks
clean
i
then
he
added
fust
mate
i
cal
late
yo
d
better
get
under
cover
it
s
cold
enough
to
freeze
a
volcano
pears
as
he
spoke
his
breath
frosted
on
the
nipping
air
the
girl
rosy
cheeked
was
without
hat
or
coat
and
so
kissing
her
on
the
tip
of
his
nose
little
else
was
visible
and
telling
him
not
to
slip
and
to
be
sure
to
bring
her
a
pocketful
of
letters
she
darted
indoors
she
felt
radiantly
happy
that
glorious
morning
and
if
she
had
been
familiar
with
the
poems
of
robert
browning
she
would
have
sung
god
s
in
his
heaven
all
s
right
with
the
world
but
instead
her
wordless
song
reverberated
through
the
small
house
until
her
tasks
were
finished
then
putting
on
her
leggins
her
crimson
tam
and
and
taking
a
small
bag
of
bread
crumbs
she
waded
through
the
snow
to
the
cliff
to
try
to
find
her
feathered
friends
she
called
and
waited
soon
calling
again
then
from
out
a
sheltered
cave
in
a
cliff
nearby
they
came
circling
about
her
in
the
clear
crisp
air
uttering
their
discordant
cries
which
however
were
music
to
the
ears
of
the
girl
who
knew
that
they
were
notes
of
joy
and
welcome
to
the
friend
who
fed
them
through
the
bitter
cold
months
of
winter
when
fish
were
scarce
and
hard
to
catch
muriel
did
not
toss
the
fragments
of
bread
this
time
for
she
knew
if
she
did
so
they
would
sink
into
the
soft
depths
of
snow
and
be
lost
and
so
she
brushed
a
rock
clear
and
placed
the
feast
upon
it
down
the
birds
swooped
unafraid
it
was
too
cold
to
remain
long
out
of
doors
and
moreover
muriel
wished
to
have
a
nice
hot
dinner
awaiting
the
coming
of
her
an
appetizing
odor
of
coffee
and
sizzling
bacon
greeted
the
old
man
when
two
hours
later
he
opened
the
door
and
entered
the
kitchen
the
girl
flushed
of
cheek
and
turned
to
greet
him
any
mail
muriel
s
heart
was
pounding
fast
when
she
asked
the
question
the
old
man
laughed
as
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
deep
pocket
of
his
leather
coat
mrs
sol
said
that
if
i
hadn
t
cruised
to
town
today
she
was
of
nine
minds
to
hire
the
lighter
to
fetch
yer
mail
over
she
was
feared
the
floor
of
her
store
d
heave
in
with
the
weight
of
it
he
said
the
girl
s
excited
laughter
rang
out
oh
she
said
why
does
your
coat
bulge
so
queer
like
i
cal
late
you
ve
fetched
somethin
hid
under
she
pounced
upon
him
and
drew
forth
the
bulgy
something
which
proved
to
be
a
large
square
package
the
wrappings
were
soon
removed
and
there
was
the
most
wonderful
book
treasure
island
illustrated
in
the
most
beautiful
blues
and
greens
and
gold
how
muriel
loved
color
gene
sent
it
she
said
as
she
lifted
the
card
with
its
painted
wreath
of
holly
and
mistletoe
but
muriel
then
had
no
time
to
look
at
the
book
as
letters
were
being
produced
from
that
great
pocket
the
girl
gasped
when
she
saw
them
and
then
she
clapped
her
hands
she
exclaimed
unbelievingly
are
they
all
for
me
i
reckon
mis
sol
did
think
twas
a
powerful
lot
o
mail
bein
as
i
never
had
more
n
one
and
a
card
before
at
a
there
were
four
letters
from
gene
who
had
written
one
each
week
since
he
had
left
windy
island
he
knew
his
storm
maiden
could
not
write
and
so
he
did
not
expect
answers
what
he
did
not
know
was
that
the
blizzard
had
prevented
her
receiving
them
as
they
arrived
each
week
there
was
another
letter
from
ireland
and
a
christmas
card
and
a
parcel
from
uncle
lem
there
were
pretty
hair
ribbons
in
the
parcel
christmas
in
february
muriel
laughed
then
added
the
blizzard
sort
o
got
the
calendar
mixed
didn
t
it
muriel
took
her
new
treasures
up
to
her
room
and
placed
them
on
the
top
of
her
chest
of
drawers
she
sighed
as
she
looked
at
the
letters
and
longed
to
know
the
messages
they
contained
it
would
take
her
until
spring
she
feared
to
decipher
them
as
she
would
have
to
study
them
word
by
word
with
the
aid
of
the
second
reader
chapter
xxii
facing
realities
march
came
and
april
followed
muriel
thought
that
never
before
had
there
been
so
lovely
a
spring
the
returning
birds
surely
sang
more
wonderful
songs
than
in
the
springs
that
were
past
the
melting
snow
on
the
cliffs
trickled
down
forming
sparkling
miniature
waterfalls
then
after
a
warm
spell
out
of
every
crevice
in
the
rocks
wild
flowers
blossomed
the
girl
running
to
the
highest
peak
one
glorious
morning
flung
her
arms
out
toward
the
sky
letting
the
wind
blow
her
hair
as
it
would
and
if
gene
had
seen
his
storm
maiden
at
that
moment
he
would
have
had
a
third
picture
of
her
that
he
would
never
wish
to
forget
oh
it
s
glad
i
am
to
be
livin
she
said
aloud
the
world
is
so
wonderful
and
friends
are
so
kind
i
m
that
happy
so
the
birds
her
birds
were
soon
circling
about
her
for
although
there
was
plenty
for
them
to
eat
muriel
fed
them
just
for
the
joy
of
it
i
love
every
one
of
yo
she
told
them
an
yo
too
poor
ol
lame
pelican
she
called
to
a
larger
bird
that
descended
when
the
flock
of
white
gulls
had
swooped
down
to
the
sea
one
of
them
having
sighted
a
luckless
fish
that
was
glinting
too
near
the
surface
of
the
water
then
scrambling
down
to
her
treasure
cave
the
girl
brought
from
its
hiding
place
in
a
crevice
the
second
reader
going
out
on
the
ledge
she
sat
for
a
moment
just
gazing
at
the
sparkling
surf
that
was
crashing
far
beneath
her
thrusting
her
hand
into
her
pocket
she
drew
forth
a
letter
bearing
the
new
york
postmark
it
was
the
last
that
she
had
received
from
gene
having
been
left
at
the
lighthouse
by
little
sol
muriel
had
been
in
the
middle
of
breadmaking
then
but
all
the
hour
she
had
been
filled
with
eager
anticipation
for
in
his
last
letter
gene
had
told
her
that
in
the
spring
he
was
to
have
a
vacation
he
had
been
at
college
since
the
beginning
of
the
midwinter
term
and
that
even
if
he
could
only
spare
a
day
for
it
he
was
going
to
visit
windy
island
muriel
while
finishing
the
baking
had
been
happily
wondering
how
her
comrade
would
look
after
his
month
s
confinement
at
his
studies
perhaps
the
bronze
from
the
wind
and
the
sun
would
be
worn
away
and
again
he
would
be
pale
as
he
was
when
she
had
first
known
him
how
she
hoped
not
she
wanted
him
to
keep
every
bit
of
the
strength
he
had
gained
during
his
month
s
visit
on
windy
island
muriel
removed
the
letter
her
heart
beating
rapidly
she
was
sure
that
in
it
he
would
tell
the
day
of
his
coming
soon
very
soon
she
hoped
as
she
wished
him
to
see
how
lovely
her
island
home
was
when
the
wild
flowers
blossomed
during
the
past
months
muriel
had
become
familiar
with
many
of
the
simple
words
that
gene
used
in
writing
to
her
and
she
had
to
refer
less
frequently
to
the
second
reader
with
comparative
ease
she
read
the
few
lines
dear
friend
muriel
i
hoped
to
have
good
news
to
tell
you
today
but
after
all
i
am
not
to
have
my
visit
with
you
last
night
helen
received
a
cablegram
from
our
father
telling
us
to
join
them
at
once
in
london
and
so
we
are
to
depart
without
delay
as
dad
has
reserved
passage
for
us
on
the
steamship
the
liverpool
which
leaves
its
dock
tomorrow
at
dawn
dear
good
friend
don
t
forget
me
i
don
t
know
what
this
command
from
our
father
means
i
surely
hope
that
mother
is
not
ill
but
of
course
it
is
a
command
which
helen
and
i
must
obey
i
shall
write
you
however
as
soon
as
i
reach
the
other
side
of
the
broad
atlantic
tell
your
grandfather
please
how
grateful
i
am
and
ever
shall
be
to
him
for
having
permitted
me
to
share
his
home
for
that
wonderful
month
muriel
come
what
may
believe
me
when
i
say
that
next
to
helen
your
friendship
is
dearer
to
me
than
that
of
any
girl
whom
i
know
this
letter
sounds
as
though
i
hardly
expect
to
come
back
to
the
only
country
under
the
sun
but
that
isn
t
true
heaven
willing
i
ll
return
when
i
m
if
i
have
to
remain
over
there
until
then
goodbye
storm
maiden
your
friend
the
sun
was
still
shining
and
the
waves
sparkling
the
birds
still
singing
and
the
flowers
blooming
when
muriel
had
deciphered
the
message
in
that
letter
but
the
glory
of
the
day
was
gone
for
her
and
there
was
no
echo
of
song
in
her
heart
she
arose
saddened
and
after
replacing
the
second
reader
in
its
niche
climbed
the
steep
trail
up
the
cliff
and
returned
to
the
light
chapter
xxiii
the
storm
the
wonderful
weather
continued
and
if
there
was
loneliness
in
the
heart
of
the
girl
because
her
friend
and
comrade
seemed
to
be
so
far
so
very
far
away
it
was
unnoticed
by
the
old
man
who
loved
her
for
whenever
he
was
near
her
clear
voice
rang
out
its
sweetest
and
her
welcoming
smile
always
awaited
him
june
came
and
captain
ezra
returning
from
town
about
noon
on
a
day
that
was
with
blue
in
sky
and
sea
as
only
a
day
in
june
can
be
produced
a
letter
how
the
girl
hoped
that
it
was
from
her
friend
across
the
water
but
instead
it
was
from
doctor
winslow
in
it
he
stated
that
he
was
coming
to
tunkett
for
a
week
s
rest
as
he
had
had
a
most
strenuous
winter
and
since
he
was
not
as
young
as
he
had
been
he
felt
the
need
now
and
then
of
a
period
of
relaxation
he
was
eager
to
see
his
comrade
of
boyhood
days
he
recalled
the
happy
carefree
times
when
barefooted
they
had
tramped
over
the
salt
meadows
swam
together
breasting
even
the
outer
breakers
or
had
fished
talking
quietly
for
hours
of
their
plans
for
the
future
which
had
proved
so
unlike
ez
old
pal
the
doctor
had
written
i
want
especially
to
talk
over
with
you
something
which
has
been
much
in
my
thoughts
of
late
and
that
is
the
future
of
the
girl
whom
you
love
so
dearly
and
whom
for
that
matter
we
both
love
you
are
not
as
unreasonable
now
as
you
formerly
were
and
so
i
again
shall
broach
the
subject
of
muriel
s
education
as
i
have
said
before
i
wish
to
pay
her
tuition
as
my
share
for
am
i
not
her
uncle
lem
you
and
i
are
advanced
in
years
ezra
and
we
re
not
always
going
to
be
here
to
protect
muriel
think
how
unfitted
she
now
is
to
face
the
world
with
no
knowledge
whatever
of
its
ways
but
more
of
this
later
when
i
although
there
was
disappointment
in
the
heart
of
the
girl
because
the
letter
had
not
been
from
gene
she
was
indeed
glad
to
hear
that
she
was
so
soon
to
see
her
dear
uncle
lem
as
it
had
been
many
months
since
his
town
house
had
been
boarded
up
and
he
had
departed
for
the
big
city
lem
s
to
put
into
port
next
tuesday
the
old
man
said
i
reckon
he
s
right
about
the
iddication
idee
i
cal
late
yo
d
ought
to
be
gittin
some
larnin
into
that
purty
head
o
yo
rn
not
but
that
yo
re
suitin
me
to
a
t
jest
as
yo
are
but
lem
knows
best
i
there
was
a
sad
note
in
the
voice
of
the
old
man
and
a
suspicion
of
moisture
in
the
grey
eyes
that
looked
so
lovingly
at
his
quickly
he
turned
away
to
hide
them
he
had
been
selfish
long
enough
and
life
was
tarnel
unsartin
at
best
then
he
recalled
the
letter
that
he
planned
writing
to
muriel
s
own
father
he
had
an
address
that
his
daughter
had
once
sent
to
him
and
in
the
accompanying
note
she
had
written
dad
a
letter
sent
here
will
always
reach
my
husband
or
me
please
write
that
you
have
forgiven
me
for
i
do
so
love
that
note
from
muriel
s
with
the
address
to
which
they
were
to
write
if
they
wished
to
reach
her
father
was
in
the
iron
box
hidden
in
the
tower
near
the
great
lamp
the
very
box
of
which
captain
ezra
had
told
captain
barney
if
i
should
be
tuk
the
old
man
had
said
i
want
yo
to
go
to
the
tower
get
that
box
barney
an
have
write
to
the
father
o
my
captain
ezra
was
thinking
of
these
things
as
he
sat
smoking
i
snum
i
ll
get
that
thar
letter
written
next
sunday
as
sure
sartin
as
i
m
keeper
of
the
light
he
resolved
as
he
rose
to
go
to
bed
the
next
day
the
first
intense
heat
wave
of
summer
swept
over
tunkett
the
air
was
depressing
muriel
listlessly
went
about
the
tasks
of
the
day
it
seemed
an
effort
even
to
sing
which
she
always
tried
to
do
to
make
the
little
home
more
cheerful
never
never
should
her
dear
old
know
how
lonely
and
disappointed
she
was
because
gene
had
not
even
written
to
her
it
was
nearing
july
and
as
yet
she
had
not
heard
of
his
safe
arrival
in
liverpool
boats
did
go
down
now
and
then
the
girl
knew
and
when
she
thought
of
this
she
asked
anxiously
thar
hasn
t
been
a
wreck
on
the
seas
anywhar
that
you
ve
heard
of
has
thar
captain
ezra
shook
his
head
no
rilly
fust
mate
and
i
sure
sartin
hope
thar
s
none
comin
the
next
evening
when
the
old
man
came
in
to
supper
he
reported
that
the
stifling
air
seemed
if
anything
more
hot
and
breathless
and
also
that
clouds
were
gathering
rapidly
i
reckon
we
re
glad
o
that
was
his
comment
then
as
he
stood
looking
out
at
the
deepening
twilight
he
continued
thar
s
heat
lit
nin
over
to
the
west
like
s
not
we
ll
soon
have
a
thunder
storm
i
sort
o
hope
we
will
have
one
twill
cool
off
this
stiflin
air
the
girl
turned
toward
him
her
face
white
oh
she
implored
and
her
voice
quivered
i
m
hopin
it
won
t
come
here
with
its
crashin
an
threatenin
i
allays
seem
to
hear
it
say
some
day
i
ll
the
old
man
put
his
hand
over
the
girl
s
mouth
as
he
said
tenderly
rilly
gal
don
t
be
talkin
that
way
what
did
yo
n
i
say
tother
day
bout
thar
bein
a
skipper
at
the
helm
as
we
could
trust
didn
t
yo
n
i
agree
that
his
commands
was
allays
for
the
best
whatever
they
seemed
like
to
us
i
reckon
we
d
better
be
rememberin
then
as
he
looked
thoughtfully
out
at
the
sky
he
said
fust
mate
hold
fast
to
that
idee
like
it
was
your
life
muriel
clung
to
her
grandfather
sobbing
i
will
the
old
man
smoothed
his
gal
s
hair
wondering
vaguely
at
her
fear
and
evident
grief
doctor
lem
had
said
that
rilly
had
a
very
unusually
active
imagination
and
that
they
must
be
patient
with
her
when
they
could
not
understand
to
change
the
girl
s
thoughts
the
old
man
remarked
i
s
pose
likely
as
not
lem
landed
in
tunkett
i
hope
so
the
girl
replied
as
she
returned
to
the
setting
of
the
table
for
supper
captain
ezra
puffed
on
his
corncob
pipe
a
moment
then
said
i
reckon
he
ll
be
over
long
bout
tomorrer
i
snum
i
ll
be
glad
to
see
ol
lem
we
two
s
been
sort
o
mates
ever
since
we
was
lem
even
as
a
boy
was
straight
as
the
mast
o
a
schooner
in
all
his
doin
for
a
few
moments
the
old
man
smoked
in
silent
thought
then
aloud
i
reckon
lem
s
love
would
be
the
best
port
fer
my
gal
to
anchor
in
instantly
the
girl
s
arms
were
around
his
neck
she
implored
don
say
it
you
re
goin
to
live
s
long
as
i
do
an
longer
like
s
then
as
an
ominous
rumbling
of
thunder
pealed
in
the
distance
muriel
held
him
closer
she
said
it
s
the
old
man
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
gathering
blackness
then
loosening
her
arms
he
leaped
to
his
feet
rilly
gal
he
cried
as
she
still
clung
let
me
go
the
lamp
s
not
turnin
somethin
s
happened
to
away
he
hurried
the
girl
stood
in
the
little
kitchen
where
he
had
left
her
with
hands
hard
clasped
she
heard
his
rapid
steps
ascending
the
spiral
stairs
she
waited
almost
breathless
wondering
why
the
circle
of
swinging
light
did
not
pass
the
window
there
must
have
been
a
hitch
in
the
machinery
that
however
was
nothing
to
worry
about
it
had
happened
before
then
came
a
vivid
flash
of
fire
that
zigzagged
across
the
sky
a
torrent
of
rain
swept
over
the
island
flash
followed
flash
with
scarcely
a
second
between
and
crash
on
crash
of
deafening
thunder
then
another
sound
was
heard
in
the
midst
of
the
reverberating
roar
a
sound
of
splintering
glass
of
stone
hurled
upon
stone
muriel
s
prophecy
had
been
fulfilled
the
storm
had
wrecked
the
lamp
that
for
so
many
years
had
defied
it
with
a
terrorized
cry
the
girl
leaped
to
the
door
of
the
tower
and
heedless
of
danger
to
herself
she
climbed
the
spiral
stairway
shouting
wildly
that
her
call
might
be
heard
above
the
fury
of
the
storm
i
m
comin
but
the
rain
and
wind
beat
her
back
then
the
terrible
reality
surged
over
her
the
tower
both
were
gone
they
had
been
hurled
to
the
ground
by
the
storm
muriel
knew
no
more
for
she
had
swooned
hours
later
she
was
found
by
doctor
lem
and
several
longshoremen
who
had
crossed
the
tossing
waters
of
the
bay
to
discover
why
the
light
was
not
throwing
its
warning
beams
out
into
the
darkness
carefully
tenderly
they
lifted
her
she
had
been
bruised
by
rocks
that
had
fallen
while
she
lay
there
though
of
this
she
had
not
been
conscious
doctor
lem
and
two
of
the
men
had
taken
her
back
to
town
and
had
waited
until
she
had
revived
then
leaving
her
in
the
care
of
the
physician
s
housekeeper
brazilla
mullet
the
men
in
the
cold
grey
dawn
had
returned
to
the
island
to
find
the
keeper
of
the
light
who
had
been
faithful
even
unto
death
muriel
had
been
too
dazed
to
really
comprehend
what
had
happened
and
doctor
lem
thought
best
to
have
the
burial
service
at
once
and
not
wait
until
the
could
attend
poor
little
gal
brazilla
mullet
wiped
her
eyes
on
one
corner
of
her
apron
she
s
lost
her
best
friend
i
reckon
but
she
s
got
a
powerfully
good
one
left
in
doctor
lem
though
she
s
little
carin
jest
the
girl
who
had
been
lying
so
listlessly
in
the
spare
room
bed
opened
dazed
eyes
and
gazed
a
brief
moment
at
the
kind
woman
who
endeavored
to
smile
though
her
lips
trembled
everythin
s
like
to
be
fer
the
best
miss
brazilla
mullet
said
doctor
lem
s
goin
to
carry
out
yer
s
wishes
rilly
he
s
goin
to
be
yer
guardeen
now
an
take
yo
back
wi
him
to
the
city
an
when
yer
well
agin
yer
goin
to
school
up
thar
to
be
iddicated
wi
the
best
of
then
the
good
woman
saw
that
the
lips
of
the
girl
were
moving
though
she
was
not
addressing
her
and
leaning
closer
she
heard
the
words
i
m
rememberin
i
m
fast
to
the
promise
i
made
yo
like
twas
my
life
preserver
but
oh
it
s
so
hard
to
so
hard
to
all
then
for
the
first
time
tears
came
and
muriel
sobbed
as
though
she
would
never
stop
but
the
housekeeper
was
glad
for
tears
would
bring
the
relief
she
needed
and
brazilla
mullet
was
right
muriel
gradually
became
stronger
and
when
the
doctor
s
spring
vacation
was
ended
without
once
looking
over
the
bay
toward
windy
island
the
girl
went
back
with
him
to
the
city
chapter
xxiv
high
cliff
seminary
the
high
cliff
seminary
was
surely
well
named
for
from
the
windows
of
its
grey
stone
turrets
one
had
a
sweeping
view
of
the
surrounding
country
with
its
lovely
woodlands
its
wide
meadow
where
grain
was
yellowing
or
stacked
in
the
sun
with
here
and
there
a
nestling
town
a
suburb
of
the
big
city
that
was
several
miles
nearer
the
sea
directly
beneath
were
the
sheer
cliffs
and
then
the
broad
busy
hudson
on
the
sun
porch
one
saturday
afternoon
in
september
a
group
of
girls
was
gathered
it
was
evident
that
they
were
all
old
friends
as
indeed
they
were
since
they
had
attended
high
cliff
seminary
the
year
previous
among
them
were
faith
morley
gladys
goodsell
and
marianne
carnot
leaning
back
in
a
comfortable
cushioned
wicker
chair
marianne
looked
at
the
other
through
partly
closed
eyes
your
democracy
in
america
is
crude
n
pas
she
said
shrugging
her
shoulders
and
looking
toward
the
far
end
of
the
long
veranda
there
all
alone
stood
a
girl
dressed
in
dark
blue
whose
hair
was
neatly
fastened
at
her
neck
with
hands
idly
clasped
in
front
of
her
she
watched
the
boats
plying
up
and
down
the
great
river
and
oh
the
loneliness
the
bleak
grey
loneliness
in
the
heart
of
the
girl
without
a
glance
at
the
curious
group
at
the
other
end
of
the
sun
porch
she
soon
turned
and
went
within
well
i
confess
democracy
is
carried
rather
far
in
this
particular
instance
the
plump
gladys
goodsell
remarked
not
that
i
care
greatly
we
do
not
have
to
associate
with
her
whoever
she
is
unless
we
so
doesn
t
anyone
know
who
she
is
catherine
lambert
inquired
the
questioner
did
not
look
at
the
french
girl
nor
would
she
have
been
able
to
interpret
the
meaning
of
the
slight
sneer
that
appeared
on
the
dark
handsome
face
for
a
fleeting
second
even
if
she
had
seen
it
marianne
had
told
no
one
that
she
had
met
muriel
the
year
before
on
windy
island
and
muriel
herself
though
conscious
of
the
presence
of
marianne
carnot
was
so
numbed
with
grief
that
she
cared
little
that
she
was
being
snubbed
the
coming
of
that
crude
island
girl
to
this
fashionable
school
had
angered
marianne
but
the
memory
of
gene
s
very
evident
preference
for
muriel
s
companionship
had
aroused
in
the
heart
of
the
french
girl
a
desire
to
make
the
other
suffer
but
she
would
bide
her
time
is
it
true
that
she
can
not
speak
the
english
language
correctly
the
tone
of
the
questioner
was
horrified
in
the
extreme
faith
morley
nodded
adding
hastily
because
her
heart
was
kind
but
that
in
itself
is
not
vital
for
surely
she
can
learn
to
speak
correctly
of
course
her
family
is
rather
a
s
this
from
adelaine
stuart
whose
family
tree
was
always
shown
to
each
new
pupil
at
high
cliff
if
she
chanced
to
be
one
whom
adelaine
wished
to
impress
that
her
father
was
imprisoned
for
having
robbed
widows
and
orphans
with
his
wildcat
schemes
she
did
not
tell
but
faith
you
know
something
of
the
girl
s
story
why
don
t
you
tell
it
this
from
gladys
faith
hesitated
would
helen
wish
her
to
tell
and
yet
surely
there
was
nothing
in
what
she
knew
that
ought
to
be
kept
secret
well
what
i
know
is
not
much
faith
confessed
muriel
storm
is
an
acquaintance
of
gene
beavers
exclamations
of
amazement
interrupted
the
speaker
conscious
of
the
shock
and
surprise
her
statement
had
caused
in
the
group
faith
hurried
on
to
explain
you
remember
gene
had
to
leave
college
last
fall
because
of
a
collapse
of
some
several
nodded
well
he
then
went
to
tunkett
a
town
to
recuperate
and
while
there
he
met
the
keeper
of
the
light
who
was
muriel
s
grandfather
they
did
a
good
deal
helen
told
me
to
help
gene
regain
his
this
last
rather
defiantly
faith
unlike
the
others
was
not
a
snob
at
heart
nor
for
that
matter
was
gladys
poor
girl
she
now
put
in
i
do
feel
sorry
for
her
anyone
who
watches
her
for
five
minutes
can
tell
that
she
has
a
broken
why
that
what
has
happened
to
her
adelaine
stuart
was
curious
i
wonder
if
any
of
you
recall
that
terrible
electric
storm
that
we
had
last
june
faith
continued
i
remember
how
it
crashed
over
new
york
said
there
had
not
been
one
as
severe
in
twenty
years
well
it
was
during
that
storm
that
the
lighthouse
was
struck
by
lightning
the
old
man
was
instantly
killed
and
the
girl
hurled
beneath
the
debris
she
was
unconscious
hours
later
when
she
was
finally
rescued
all
summer
long
she
has
been
in
a
hospital
in
the
city
under
the
care
of
some
physician
whose
home
was
formerly
in
that
same
town
he
it
is
who
is
sending
her
they
saw
that
the
girl
about
whom
they
were
talking
left
the
veranda
apparently
without
having
noticed
them
faith
went
on
years
ago
doctor
winslow
s
sister
and
our
miss
gordon
were
miss
gordon
was
the
charming
woman
who
presided
over
high
cliffs
then
this
muriel
storm
not
only
belongs
to
a
class
of
fisherfolk
but
she
is
also
a
charity
adelaine
stuart
tried
to
show
by
her
tone
and
expression
the
pride
and
scorn
which
should
be
exhibited
by
one
possessed
of
a
family
tree
i
shall
write
my
mother
she
concluded
and
if
i
am
not
much
mistaken
miss
gordon
will
consider
it
greatly
to
her
advantage
to
at
once
dismiss
that
i
shall
do
the
same
phyllis
dexter
echoed
we
ought
not
to
be
forced
to
breathe
the
same
air
une
bourgeoise
marianne
concluded
the
sentence
for
her
the
others
did
not
notice
when
faith
morley
slipped
away
she
rebuked
herself
for
not
having
thought
of
it
before
surely
her
dear
friend
helen
beavers
would
wish
her
to
be
kind
to
the
girl
whose
grandfather
had
been
kind
to
gene
faith
paused
outside
of
a
room
on
the
third
floor
of
high
cliff
seminary
and
listened
surely
someone
within
was
sobbing
again
her
loving
heart
rebuked
her
how
many
many
hours
during
the
last
week
that
the
island
girl
had
been
in
their
midst
had
she
sobbed
like
this
and
no
one
had
come
to
comfort
her
muriel
was
in
none
of
faith
s
classes
and
so
she
seldom
saw
her
nor
did
she
eat
with
the
other
pupils
in
the
main
dining
hall
for
temporarily
she
was
seated
at
the
right
of
miss
gordon
at
the
teachers
table
there
being
a
vacant
chair
which
soon
would
be
occupied
by
miss
humphrey
the
english
teacher
whose
leave
of
absence
had
not
yet
expired
the
problem
of
finding
a
seat
for
poor
muriel
at
first
had
been
a
hard
one
for
miss
gordon
to
solve
for
she
knew
full
well
how
heartless
and
snobbish
were
many
of
the
daughters
of
her
wealthy
patrons
when
she
received
a
message
from
miss
humphrey
stating
that
she
would
not
return
for
another
fortnight
the
principal
talked
the
matter
over
with
the
faculty
and
muriel
was
then
invited
to
sit
with
the
teachers
until
the
absent
one
should
return
this
would
give
miss
gordon
time
to
discover
if
any
of
the
pupils
were
kindly
disposed
toward
muriel
and
if
so
she
could
then
be
placed
at
one
of
the
three
long
tables
in
the
main
dining
hall
at
which
the
young
ladies
were
seated
the
teachers
table
was
in
a
curtained
alcove
and
so
many
of
the
girls
were
not
even
aware
of
the
fact
that
muriel
dined
there
moreover
it
had
been
doctor
lem
s
wish
that
the
island
girl
should
receive
private
instruction
and
as
miss
humphrey
was
the
only
teacher
whose
time
could
be
arranged
to
make
this
plan
possible
muriel
s
studies
had
not
as
yet
begun
every
day
miss
gordon
sent
for
the
girl
to
come
to
her
room
at
the
twilight
hour
at
first
she
did
this
for
the
sake
of
doctor
lem
whose
sister
had
been
her
dear
friend
but
after
a
time
she
did
it
gladly
for
she
found
in
the
soul
of
this
untutored
girl
much
that
it
would
be
a
joy
to
awaken
and
develop
but
of
course
there
were
many
hours
every
day
when
muriel
was
left
alone
oh
so
alone
while
the
other
girls
were
at
their
classes
she
wandered
about
the
extensive
parklike
grounds
that
grew
wilder
and
more
beautiful
so
muriel
thought
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
hudson
and
away
from
the
school
there
she
found
a
spot
on
an
overhanging
ledge
where
a
young
pine
tree
was
clinging
none
too
securely
to
the
bank
for
after
each
storm
the
earth
beneath
it
loosened
and
a
day
was
coming
when
that
small
pine
and
the
ledge
on
which
it
stood
would
be
hurled
down
the
steep
cliff
into
the
blue
waters
seething
far
below
the
cliff
on
which
the
light
had
stood
the
island
girl
had
thought
high
but
this
was
a
sheer
wall
of
rock
that
rose
twice
as
far
from
the
water
toward
the
sky
the
little
pine
had
grown
very
dear
to
the
girl
who
so
loved
nature
and
often
she
would
sit
on
the
ledge
her
cheek
pressed
against
the
rough
bark
her
eyes
gazing
far
up
the
river
seeing
not
the
boats
of
all
kinds
that
were
plying
back
and
forth
hearing
not
the
discordant
sounds
of
screeching
tugs
or
warning
whistles
but
picturing
in
memory
the
island
she
so
loved
and
the
lighthouse
standing
as
it
had
for
so
many
many
years
and
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
as
in
a
dream
she
saw
her
grandfather
again
as
he
had
looked
on
that
day
and
then
suddenly
she
would
sob
and
hold
her
arms
out
calling
come
and
get
your
rilly
gal
on
one
of
these
occasions
she
had
cried
herself
weary
and
for
a
moment
she
had
slept
on
the
little
overhanging
ledge
her
seemed
to
come
to
her
and
say
so
plainly
that
she
heard
his
voice
fust
mate
didn
t
you
n
me
agree
that
we
d
trust
the
skipper
at
the
helm
knowin
his
guidin
to
be
for
the
best
yeah
she
said
aloud
sitting
up
and
looking
about
then
she
rose
and
drew
back
shuddering
for
she
had
been
very
close
to
the
edge
of
the
overhanging
ledge
how
easy
it
would
be
to
fall
off
the
girl
turned
and
ran
all
the
way
back
to
the
school
that
had
been
the
day
before
and
today
she
was
staying
indoors
half
afraid
to
visit
the
ledge
she
sat
up
and
looked
toward
the
door
when
she
heard
a
knock
come
in
she
called
leaping
to
her
feet
her
visitor
she
supposed
would
be
either
miss
gordon
or
the
maid
of
that
corridor
when
muriel
saw
a
strange
girl
in
the
hall
she
felt
rebellious
believing
that
she
had
called
out
of
unkind
curiosity
but
faith
held
out
her
right
hand
as
she
said
graciously
miss
storm
i
am
faith
morley
one
of
your
schoolmates
i
am
sorry
that
i
have
not
been
up
to
see
you
sooner
helen
beavers
and
gene
are
dear
friends
of
mine
as
perhaps
you
do
not
know
and
i
am
convinced
that
they
would
wish
me
to
be
your
friend
then
feeling
that
the
sentiment
could
be
put
in
an
even
more
kindly
way
she
added
impulsively
truly
i
want
to
be
your
friend
may
i
tears
gathered
slowly
in
the
clear
hazel
eyes
and
the
lips
that
replied
quivered
thanks
but
i
dunno
why
you
d
be
carin
for
my
frien
ship
if
you
do
though
i
m
they
sat
in
chairs
near
each
other
and
faith
looking
for
the
first
time
with
eyes
that
really
saw
muriel
decided
that
she
had
a
most
interesting
face
there
was
far
more
depth
of
character
expressed
in
it
than
in
many
of
the
pretty
doll
faces
of
the
pupils
at
high
cliffs
for
one
wild
second
the
visitor
groped
for
a
subject
of
conversation
that
would
interest
this
island
girl
of
course
she
might
have
gossiped
about
the
other
pupils
in
the
school
but
faith
had
been
taught
never
to
talk
of
persons
but
rather
of
things
and
events
she
now
recalled
having
heard
helen
say
that
muriel
had
never
been
farther
inland
than
tunkett
while
she
faith
had
circled
the
globe
with
her
parents
two
years
before
then
her
eyes
fell
upon
the
copy
of
treasure
island
muriel
s
gift
from
gene
do
you
enjoy
that
book
the
visitor
asked
i
can
t
read
muriel
replied
simply
but
i
love
the
sea
an
the
life
on
it
cap
n
barney
often
told
me
tales
of
sea
adventure
an
gene
beavers
read
to
me
out
of
this
faith
s
dark
eyes
lighted
oh
muriel
she
exclaimed
my
father
gave
me
such
an
interesting
book
about
the
sea
for
my
birthday
and
i
m
reading
it
now
i
d
just
love
to
read
it
aloud
to
you
if
you
would
enjoy
hearing
it
of
course
it
will
come
in
your
reading
course
in
time
shall
i
get
the
book
there
was
real
eagerness
in
faith
s
voice
and
also
in
her
heart
for
she
yearned
to
help
this
girl
who
as
yet
hadn
t
been
given
a
chance
muriel
was
indeed
pleased
with
the
suggestion
and
so
faith
went
at
once
to
her
room
returning
a
few
moments
later
with
a
beautifully
illustrated
copy
of
two
years
before
the
muriel
she
announced
when
she
opened
the
door
this
time
without
knocking
i
wonder
if
you
know
how
lucky
you
are
you
have
the
nicest
room
in
the
school
this
round
cupola
room
with
so
many
windows
and
such
a
sweeping
view
in
three
directions
is
the
one
that
many
of
us
hope
each
year
will
be
given
to
then
she
laughed
honestly
i
do
not
eavesdrop
but
i
happened
to
be
in
the
reception
room
the
first
day
of
this
term
and
heard
adelaine
stuart
s
mother
offering
to
pay
extra
if
her
spoiled
darling
could
have
it
but
miss
gordon
said
it
had
been
reserved
for
you
think
of
that
young
lady
moreover
you
are
doubly
lucky
for
not
only
have
you
the
nicest
room
in
the
school
but
you
are
invited
to
spend
an
hour
every
evening
with
the
idol
of
all
our
hearts
the
adorable
miss
muriel
smiled
at
her
new
friend
s
enthusiasm
twa
n
t
last
long
though
she
replied
i
mean
miss
gordon
s
just
bein
kind
to
me
now
because
she
knows
as
i
m
lonesome
an
she
n
uncle
lem
are
faith
looked
pityingly
at
the
girl
whose
shadowed
eyes
plainly
showed
that
many
hours
had
been
spent
in
tears
muriel
she
suggested
suppose
you
lie
on
the
window
seat
pile
those
pillows
under
your
head
and
try
to
rest
while
i
read
i
m
afraid
you
are
holding
yourself
too
tense
these
days
as
our
gym
teacher
tells
muriel
did
as
she
was
bidden
and
faith
continued
now
take
a
deep
breath
and
drop
down
on
the
pillows
with
every
muscle
relaxed
listen
idly
while
i
read
until
you
fall
asleep
i
really
think
that
restful
sleep
is
what
you
most
then
faith
read
for
an
hour
muriel
was
greatly
interested
but
she
was
also
very
weary
and
after
a
time
she
did
fall
into
the
first
restful
sleep
that
she
had
had
since
she
arrived
at
the
school
faith
drew
a
cover
over
her
new
friend
and
stole
out
but
she
did
not
go
directly
to
her
own
room
instead
she
went
to
the
office
of
miss
gordon
chapter
xxv
muriel
finds
a
friend
miss
gordon
looked
up
from
her
desk
at
which
she
was
writing
when
at
her
request
the
door
of
the
office
opened
oh
good
afternoon
faith
dear
she
said
when
she
saw
the
little
brown
maid
who
stood
there
for
the
girl
surely
was
hair
eyes
and
skin
being
dark
can
you
spare
a
moment
faith
asked
not
wishing
to
interrupt
for
she
knew
that
her
mission
could
be
postponed
as
many
as
you
wish
come
in
and
sit
down
i
know
by
your
eager
expression
that
you
have
something
to
ask
or
to
tell
what
is
it
dear
it
s
about
muriel
storm
miss
gordon
that
i
wish
to
speak
i
have
been
with
her
for
the
last
two
the
principal
looked
her
pleasure
oh
faith
she
said
i
m
so
glad
if
you
are
taking
an
interest
in
poor
muriel
there
is
wonderful
material
in
that
girl
and
you
are
the
one
pupil
in
the
whole
school
whom
i
had
thought
of
asking
to
befriend
her
but
i
decided
to
wait
and
see
if
there
were
any
who
would
be
kind
to
her
without
my
having
asked
it
as
a
i
too
think
that
muriel
is
very
unusual
the
girl
declared
warmly
when
i
visited
her
room
today
i
felt
at
once
that
yearning
one
would
feel
for
any
helpless
thing
that
was
hurt
but
soon
i
became
interested
in
her
for
herself
alone
i
never
before
saw
a
face
that
registers
emotion
more
wonderfully
as
miss
burns
calls
it
in
our
drama
you
are
right
miss
gordon
replied
i
soon
found
that
muriel
loved
nature
passionately
and
what
do
you
suppose
we
have
been
doing
during
the
evening
hour
that
we
have
spent
together
this
week
reading
and
listening
to
the
great
nature
poems
and
dear
one
night
when
the
girl
came
to
me
she
said
almost
shyly
miss
gordon
i
a
little
verse
today
when
i
was
out
with
my
pine
and
then
she
told
it
although
crudely
worded
that
little
poem
promises
much
it
described
the
surf
beating
on
the
rocks
of
her
windy
island
home
and
of
a
lame
pelican
which
is
unable
to
compete
with
the
more
active
birds
in
its
struggle
for
existence
and
depends
largely
on
muriel
for
its
sustenance
she
had
been
thinking
of
this
bird
friend
it
seemed
and
of
the
nature
poems
that
i
had
read
when
this
little
verse
came
to
her
miss
gordon
do
you
think
that
this
untaught
island
girl
is
really
a
poet
at
heart
i
think
just
that
but
dear
muriel
is
not
untaught
true
it
is
that
she
can
not
speak
our
language
she
knows
nothing
of
science
or
numbers
but
she
has
been
taught
high
ideals
by
one
of
nature
s
noblemen
her
grandfather
too
she
has
been
taught
the
of
ireland
by
another
whom
she
calls
captain
barney
and
nature
the
winds
sky
storm
birds
and
sea
have
taught
her
much
else
there
are
few
girls
at
high
cliffs
who
are
as
well
grounded
in
things
worth
while
as
is
our
muriel
storm
now
dear
what
is
it
you
wish
to
say
faith
hesitated
then
said
i
was
thinking
that
it
might
be
pleasant
for
muriel
to
sit
in
the
dining
hall
with
then
she
added
flushing
of
course
miss
gordon
it
is
pleasant
for
her
to
be
with
you
the
older
woman
placed
a
hand
upon
faith
s
as
she
said
dear
i
understand
and
also
i
have
been
waiting
for
this
to
happen
i
wanted
to
place
her
where
she
would
be
happy
and
not
unkindly
treated
what
is
your
suggestion
i
was
wondering
if
phyllis
dexter
who
sits
between
gladys
goodsell
and
me
could
not
be
placed
at
the
long
table
with
her
friend
adelaine
stuart
every
day
she
wishes
that
she
were
there
and
then
muriel
could
sit
next
to
me
gladys
will
be
very
kind
to
there
was
a
glad
light
in
the
eyes
of
the
principal
she
touched
a
button
twice
in
rapid
succession
and
the
head
waitress
soon
appeared
the
change
was
ordered
and
then
when
the
maid
had
departed
miss
gordon
arose
dear
she
said
in
fifteen
minutes
the
supper
bell
will
ring
will
you
take
muriel
with
you
to
the
dining
hall
oh
thank
you
miss
gordon
i
am
so
glad
that
i
have
had
this
talk
with
muriel
was
just
waking
from
her
siesta
on
the
window
seat
feeling
wonderfully
refreshed
when
she
heard
the
bell
which
meant
that
she
had
but
fifteen
minutes
in
which
to
prepare
for
the
evening
meal
again
there
came
a
tap
on
her
door
and
this
time
muriel
called
eagerly
come
she
was
sure
that
it
would
be
faith
and
impulsively
she
whirled
about
saying
will
you
be
forgivin
me
for
fallin
asleep
when
you
was
readin
to
me
faith
caught
the
outstretched
hands
as
she
replied
yes
muriel
if
you
will
grant
me
a
great
the
island
girl
did
not
know
that
word
and
as
usual
her
face
registered
her
perplexity
faith
laughed
then
more
seriously
dear
i
would
not
hurt
your
feelings
for
worlds
but
i
was
wondering
if
you
would
like
me
to
help
you
to
speak
as
we
do
she
looked
anxiously
into
the
clear
hazel
eyes
and
to
her
joy
she
saw
a
glad
light
dawning
there
oh
i
d
be
thankful
if
you
d
care
that
very
well
we
ll
begin
on
the
sentence
you
said
a
moment
muriel
slowly
repeated
it
correctly
after
faith
then
she
exclaimed
happily
there
s
a
rift
in
the
clouds
for
me
an
the
sun
s
there
were
sudden
tears
but
also
a
shining
smile
as
she
added
twill
be
a
long
while
before
i
can
get
the
speakin
right
but
i
ll
the
last
bell
for
supper
was
pealing
through
the
corridors
and
faith
catching
the
hand
of
muriel
hurried
her
away
there
were
groups
of
girls
in
twos
and
threes
going
down
the
circling
stairway
and
although
many
of
them
greeted
faith
none
even
smiled
at
her
companion
but
there
were
three
who
swept
past
with
their
heads
held
high
these
snobbish
girls
were
marianne
carnot
adelaine
stuart
and
phyllis
dexter
but
a
second
later
skipping
feet
were
heard
back
of
them
and
plump
gladys
goodsell
caught
faith
by
the
arm
belovedest
friend
she
said
after
nodding
at
muriel
where
hast
thou
been
this
afternoon
didst
forget
that
we
were
to
play
tennis
at
four
faith
turned
truly
contrite
i
ll
have
to
confess
that
i
did
forget
gladys
i
am
so
sorry
are
you
very
hurt
with
me
a
jolly
laugh
rang
out
at
this
reply
getting
angry
would
take
more
energy
than
i
have
to
then
more
seriously
i
know
my
friend
faith
too
well
to
think
that
she
would
neglect
an
engagement
if
she
recalled
it
and
as
it
happened
catherine
lambert
was
pining
to
have
someone
play
singles
and
so
i
made
her
they
had
reached
the
large
pleasant
dining
hall
and
saw
many
girls
who
were
already
there
standing
behind
their
chairs
purposely
faith
delayed
her
companion
near
a
window
overlooking
the
garden
of
asters
the
island
girl
s
eyes
were
aglow
as
she
looked
out
it
s
pretty
they
are
she
said
the
like
of
em
i
ve
not
seen
we
had
the
wild
ones
but
no
planted
gladys
who
did
not
in
the
least
understand
what
was
happening
glanced
over
at
faith
who
in
a
moment
when
she
could
not
be
observed
by
muriel
placed
her
finger
on
her
lips
and
nodded
as
much
as
to
say
do
as
i
do
and
i
ll
explain
gladys
had
chummed
with
faith
and
helen
beavers
during
the
three
years
they
had
been
at
high
cliffs
and
understood
the
sign
language
of
her
friend
almost
as
well
as
she
did
the
spoken
word
so
she
knew
that
something
unexpected
was
about
to
happen
and
that
she
was
to
take
her
cue
from
faith
although
muriel
occupied
the
seat
formerly
that
of
phyllis
dexter
the
change
had
not
pleased
that
proud
girl
who
had
so
wished
to
be
placed
next
to
her
particular
friend
adelaine
stuart
instead
she
found
herself
placed
between
two
seniors
in
whom
she
was
not
remotely
interested
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
miss
gordon
had
long
been
observing
the
three
girls
marianne
phyllis
and
adelaine
and
thought
it
wise
to
keep
them
apart
whenever
it
was
possible
when
muriel
looking
almost
happy
for
the
first
time
since
her
arrival
at
high
cliffs
was
seated
she
felt
a
compelling
gaze
and
glanced
across
the
room
there
she
saw
marianne
watching
her
through
lids
there
seemed
to
be
in
the
french
girl
s
expression
a
threat
that
endangered
her
joy
and
peace
but
faith
who
also
had
seen
reached
under
the
table
and
finding
muriel
s
hand
she
held
it
in
a
close
protecting
clasp
and
the
island
girl
knew
that
come
what
might
she
would
not
have
to
stand
alone
saturday
dawned
gloriously
bright
for
it
was
indian
summer
on
the
hudson
the
air
was
soft
and
balmy
the
sunshine
hazy
and
a
dreamy
little
breeze
rustled
the
few
yellowing
leaves
that
were
still
clinging
to
the
trees
just
the
day
for
a
hike
faith
announced
at
breakfast
catherine
lambert
who
sat
across
the
table
looked
up
eagerly
and
in
answer
to
the
speaker
s
question
who
wants
to
go
she
at
once
replied
i
muriel
is
to
be
the
guest
of
faith
smiled
lovingly
at
the
girl
next
to
her
gladys
how
about
you
i
thought
we
were
to
practice
for
the
tennis
tournament
today
there
is
only
a
month
left
you
that
s
right
so
we
were
but
gladys
if
you
will
go
hiking
with
us
today
i
ll
promise
to
practice
tennis
every
afternoon
next
week
from
four
to
five
my
free
time
on
one
her
friend
looked
at
her
inquiringly
name
it
she
said
that
fifteen
minutes
each
day
may
be
devoted
to
teaching
muriel
our
favorite
agreed
who
knows
but
that
she
may
be
just
the
champion
player
for
whom
we
are
looking
gladys
good
naturedly
declared
with
sincere
fervor
and
catherine
chimed
in
with
oh
wouldn
t
it
be
great
if
we
could
make
a
player
out
of
muriel
we
haven
t
anyone
on
our
side
as
light
on
her
feet
or
as
quick
as
marianne
carnot
just
because
of
that
i
ve
actually
been
afraid
that
we
might
lose
out
on
the
great
then
to
the
listener
faith
explained
on
thanksgiving
every
year
we
have
a
tennis
tournament
marianne
and
her
friends
are
the
opponents
of
gladys
and
her
chums
of
course
naturally
we
are
eager
to
win
now
muriel
if
you
are
willing
we
will
train
you
not
that
we
expect
you
really
to
bring
victory
to
our
side
that
would
be
asking
too
much
since
marianne
carnot
was
the
champion
tennis
player
in
the
english
boarding
school
that
she
attended
before
she
came
to
america
she
has
three
medals
to
prove
her
frequently
made
boast
and
moreover
we
have
seen
her
then
as
the
surveillant
of
the
dining
hall
gave
the
signal
the
pupils
rose
and
left
in
the
lower
corridor
near
the
office
of
the
principal
faith
paused
wait
a
minute
she
said
softly
i
am
going
to
ask
miss
gordon
if
we
may
take
our
lunch
i
do
not
have
to
return
to
the
school
until
three
o
clock
just
in
time
for
my
violin
the
permission
was
readily
granted
and
then
the
four
girls
went
to
their
rooms
to
dress
for
the
hike
muriel
was
happier
than
she
had
supposed
she
would
be
ever
again
and
she
actually
smiled
at
her
reflection
as
she
donned
her
sport
skirt
sweater
and
tam
when
she
was
dressed
muriel
stood
gazing
idly
from
her
window
chapter
xxvi
muriel
receives
a
letter
when
muriel
storm
returned
from
the
hike
to
the
woodlands
and
found
upon
her
desk
a
letter
from
gene
beavers
she
did
indeed
rejoice
and
without
stopping
to
remove
her
hiking
apparel
she
curled
up
on
her
window
seat
to
read
the
missive
which
as
usual
was
couched
in
the
simplest
words
the
two
weeks
of
tutoring
which
muriel
had
received
from
faith
had
helped
her
to
read
with
far
greater
ease
the
lad
told
of
his
long
illness
which
had
resulted
from
the
cold
stormy
weather
the
rough
voyage
and
the
damp
foggy
climate
of
london
he
had
seen
nothing
of
the
city
since
his
arrival
but
even
though
they
were
living
in
one
of
the
fashionable
outlying
districts
he
could
hear
the
distant
roar
of
the
traffic
and
now
he
yearned
to
be
back
on
windy
island
where
only
were
to
be
heard
the
sounds
of
nature
when
gene
wrote
that
letter
he
knew
nothing
of
the
tragedy
of
the
lighthouse
for
although
faith
had
mentioned
it
in
a
letter
to
helen
his
sister
had
thought
best
not
to
sadden
him
with
news
that
might
be
a
shock
to
him
for
she
well
knew
how
greatly
he
admired
the
old
man
who
had
been
keeper
of
the
light
however
she
had
been
glad
to
tell
him
that
muriel
storm
was
attending
the
high
cliff
seminary
this
did
not
really
surprise
him
for
often
he
had
heard
doctor
winslow
say
that
as
soon
as
he
could
convert
the
old
sea
captain
to
his
point
of
view
he
at
his
own
expense
intended
sending
the
girl
of
whom
he
was
fond
to
some
good
boarding
school
little
did
muriel
dream
that
gene
s
proud
mother
had
sent
for
him
that
she
might
get
him
away
from
the
degrading
influence
of
the
fisherfolk
with
whom
he
had
been
staying
and
about
whom
she
had
heard
from
marianne
s
father
who
was
a
business
friend
of
beavers
then
for
months
she
positively
forbade
the
boy
to
write
to
the
island
girl
but
at
length
when
his
illness
lasted
so
long
the
mother
consented
to
permit
gene
to
write
if
he
would
promise
to
remain
in
england
until
he
was
by
that
time
he
would
have
forgotten
that
daughter
of
the
common
people
for
she
of
course
would
be
unable
to
travel
and
so
they
would
not
meet
for
a
long
time
after
the
reading
of
the
epistle
muriel
sat
with
the
letter
lying
in
her
lap
as
she
gazed
with
unseeing
eyes
at
the
busy
hudson
if
only
she
knew
how
to
write
as
yet
she
had
never
answered
one
of
gene
s
letters
nor
had
he
expected
a
reply
of
course
faith
gladys
or
catherine
lambert
all
dear
friends
would
gladly
pen
a
letter
at
her
dictation
but
that
would
not
be
quite
the
same
she
wanted
to
write
the
very
first
letter
all
by
herself
she
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
she
could
learn
it
was
nearing
five
o
clock
when
there
came
a
upon
her
door
a
signal
meaning
that
faith
awaited
without
in
reply
to
rilla
s
come
in
the
door
opened
muriel
storm
i
do
believe
that
you
have
been
again
why
haven
t
you
removed
your
hiking
togs
i
came
up
to
tell
you
that
miss
widdemere
wishes
us
to
gather
in
the
study
hall
at
for
the
first
class
of
the
year
in
the
island
girl
sprang
up
and
hastily
began
to
change
her
costume
a
class
in
politeness
is
it
she
repeated
in
a
puzzled
tone
of
voice
what
does
one
have
to
be
learnin
in
that
kind
of
a
class
faith
sat
on
the
window
seat
to
wait
until
her
friend
was
ready
to
accompany
her
oh
it
s
a
sort
of
society
stunt
so
to
speak
she
explained
we
practice
curtsies
for
grace
make
seven
different
varieties
of
calls
more
or
less
are
taught
what
to
do
with
our
hands
and
feet
how
to
be
a
hostess
and
how
to
be
a
guest
oh
yes
and
what
to
do
and
what
not
to
do
if
we
re
ever
presented
to
a
faith
was
purposely
exaggerating
she
really
believed
the
class
in
politeness
rather
unnecessary
since
the
young
ladies
came
from
homes
where
they
learned
from
babyhood
all
that
they
would
need
to
know
she
had
forgotten
for
the
moment
that
muriel
had
not
had
these
same
home
advantages
oh
i
wish
i
didn
t
have
to
be
goin
to
it
the
island
girl
said
as
she
turned
away
from
the
mirror
again
dressed
in
her
dark
blue
school
uniform
i
ll
be
that
awkward
an
i
don
t
know
nothin
about
her
voice
was
so
truly
distressed
and
the
expression
on
her
face
so
tragic
that
faith
sprang
up
from
the
window
seat
and
slipping
a
protecting
arm
about
her
friend
she
said
dear
i
ll
ask
miss
widdemere
to
excuse
you
today
that
is
just
let
you
watch
the
others
and
then
this
evening
i
ll
come
up
to
your
room
and
teach
you
the
curtsy
it
would
hardly
be
fair
to
ask
you
to
begin
with
the
others
when
many
of
them
practiced
during
the
whole
of
last
faith
had
suddenly
recalled
overhearing
a
conversation
when
she
was
on
her
way
to
the
cupola
room
adelaine
stuart
and
the
french
girl
had
been
just
ahead
of
her
and
she
had
distinctly
heard
the
former
say
if
it
is
your
desire
to
humiliate
that
lighthouse
person
wait
until
she
has
to
take
the
part
of
hostess
in
politeness
class
that
will
show
her
up
before
the
whole
the
rest
of
the
sentence
faith
had
not
heard
as
she
had
passed
the
two
schemers
with
her
head
held
high
but
when
she
came
to
think
it
over
she
wondered
why
marianne
carnot
wished
to
harm
rilla
whom
she
barely
knew
faith
resolved
to
stay
close
to
muriel
to
protect
her
if
she
could
from
whatever
humiliation
adelaine
and
marianne
might
be
planning
and
it
was
indeed
lucky
for
the
island
girl
that
she
had
so
staunch
a
friend
faith
was
glad
to
find
that
the
mistress
of
the
manners
class
was
still
in
her
office
and
thither
she
led
muriel
the
young
teacher
glanced
up
and
bade
them
enter
then
faith
asked
miss
widdemere
have
you
met
our
new
pupil
muriel
storm
there
was
a
brightening
expression
in
the
kind
grey
eyes
back
of
the
large
glasses
the
teacher
advanced
her
right
hand
extended
no
indeed
and
i
am
most
pleased
to
meet
you
a
lucky
new
pupil
you
are
to
have
the
friendship
of
our
this
with
a
loving
glance
at
the
girl
who
stood
at
muriel
s
side
yes
ma
am
thanks
miss
widdemere
s
glance
was
puzzled
though
not
unkindly
critical
it
was
not
customary
for
girls
from
the
north
to
say
ma
am
but
perhaps
this
new
pupil
was
a
southerner
the
teacher
was
even
more
perplexed
when
faith
beckoned
to
gladys
goodsell
who
stood
near
awaiting
her
friend
and
said
will
you
take
muriel
to
the
classroom
i
wish
to
speak
with
miss
widdemere
for
a
when
the
door
was
closed
in
as
few
words
as
possible
faith
told
the
tragic
story
of
muriel
s
coming
to
high
cliffs
she
has
never
had
an
opportunity
to
learn
the
ways
of
social
life
miss
widdemere
the
girl
said
earnestly
but
when
you
know
her
better
you
will
think
her
very
unusual
i
am
then
as
she
was
eager
to
create
a
favorable
impression
she
added
muriel
has
beautiful
fancies
and
our
miss
gordon
believes
that
she
is
to
be
a
real
poet
some
what
a
loyal
friend
your
friends
have
in
you
faith
what
is
your
request
it
was
granted
as
soon
as
heard
muriel
may
listen
and
watch
the
teacher
declared
but
we
will
not
ask
her
to
take
part
until
you
tell
me
that
you
have
coached
her
sufficiently
in
then
as
the
bell
in
the
corridor
was
announcing
that
laggards
must
make
haste
these
two
went
to
the
study
hall
where
the
pupils
were
assembled
some
were
seated
on
the
desk
tops
others
standing
in
groups
chatting
but
when
miss
widdemere
appeared
all
arose
and
facing
her
made
deep
curtsies
muriel
alone
remained
erect
not
knowing
what
to
do
marianne
gazing
across
the
room
through
lids
smiled
and
nudged
her
companion
she
s
as
graceful
as
a
hitching
post
adelaine
replied
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
several
who
stood
near
muriel
felt
their
gaze
and
flushed
with
embarrassment
the
young
ladies
will
now
arrange
their
chairs
in
a
large
the
vacant
space
in
the
center
to
represent
a
miss
widdemere
waited
until
the
confusion
was
over
and
the
pupils
seated
before
continuing
we
will
now
select
a
hostess
and
ten
guests
to
attend
an
afternoon
tea
whom
do
you
name
as
hostess
phyllis
she
had
turned
toward
that
young
girl
because
she
had
risen
i
name
muriel
storm
said
phyllis
who
had
been
well
coached
by
the
girls
who
sat
next
to
her
miss
widdemere
sent
a
keen
glance
in
their
direction
and
she
said
rather
coldly
young
ladies
partly
because
of
muriel
storm
s
recent
bereavement
we
are
not
expecting
her
to
share
in
our
imaginary
social
functions
for
a
month
at
marianne
carnot
added
in
an
undertone
heard
only
by
those
about
her
and
the
other
partly
is
that
she
couldn
t
if
we
did
expect
faith
eventually
was
chosen
as
hostess
and
muriel
intently
watched
every
move
made
by
her
friend
how
graceful
she
was
and
how
gracious
a
slip
of
a
japanese
girl
who
was
the
daughter
of
the
chef
of
the
school
appeared
dressed
in
an
attractive
native
costume
and
played
the
part
of
maid
for
this
class
when
she
was
older
she
too
would
be
trained
for
the
sphere
that
she
was
to
fill
that
evening
faith
found
her
friend
both
discouraged
and
homesick
it
s
out
of
place
i
am
among
you
all
she
said
i
d
ruther
be
back
with
my
seagulls
i
m
thinkin
i
ll
never
take
to
bowin
and
goin
to
faith
laughed
merrily
then
shaking
a
finger
at
rilla
prophesied
the
day
is
coming
when
you
may
be
asked
to
be
hostess
for
a
lord
or
an
earl
or
someone
like
that
then
won
t
you
be
glad
that
you
learned
how
at
high
cliff
seminary
the
idea
was
so
absurd
that
even
muriel
laughed
me
hostess
at
an
earl
s
tea
party
you
re
allays
sayin
you
have
no
imagination
but
i
m
thinkin
you
have
some
and
to
laughter
brought
a
better
humor
as
it
always
does
and
for
an
hour
that
evening
muriel
permitted
her
friend
to
teach
her
the
first
positions
to
be
made
in
the
curtsy
chapter
xxvii
muriel
begins
her
studies
a
fortnight
passed
and
during
that
time
miss
gordon
and
faith
had
started
muriel
s
development
in
several
directions
in
fact
the
younger
of
her
teachers
soon
triumphantly
announced
that
not
a
pupil
at
high
cliff
seminary
could
make
a
more
graceful
curtsy
than
muriel
the
day
before
the
expected
arrival
of
miss
humphrey
who
was
to
tutor
the
island
girl
she
confided
to
faith
that
she
just
knew
that
she
could
make
far
greater
headway
with
writing
and
reading
if
she
might
continue
practicing
them
with
her
best
friend
than
she
could
with
a
teacher
however
learned
who
was
strange
to
her
it
was
evident
to
the
three
girls
who
were
her
closest
comrades
that
muriel
dreaded
the
first
hour
that
she
was
to
spend
with
miss
humphrey
as
usual
the
island
girl
seemed
almost
to
foreknow
what
was
going
to
happen
and
when
the
moment
arrived
muriel
retreated
within
herself
so
entirely
that
at
the
close
of
a
very
trying
hour
miss
humphrey
went
down
to
the
office
of
miss
gordon
and
remarked
i
must
confess
that
i
am
extremely
disappointed
in
your
prodigy
her
english
is
deplorable
to
correct
it
will
take
indefinite
patience
and
far
more
time
than
i
can
spare
from
my
legitimate
classwork
is
there
not
some
one
who
could
undertake
her
instruction
during
the
fall
term
in
the
fundamentals
if
miss
gordon
was
discouraged
her
voice
did
not
betray
it
when
after
a
thoughtful
moment
she
replied
i
am
sorry
that
i
asked
you
to
undertake
the
tutoring
of
the
island
girl
i
hoped
that
you
would
see
in
her
the
possibilities
of
an
unusual
nature
that
i
still
contend
are
there
but
it
will
as
you
say
require
infinite
patience
to
develop
them
perhaps
i
had
better
make
some
other
arrangement
at
least
until
muriel
has
caught
up
with
your
junior
english
there
was
real
relief
pictured
on
the
face
that
was
lined
before
its
time
rising
miss
humphrey
said
i
am
indeed
glad
that
we
are
agreed
on
this
matter
and
if
muriel
storm
is
advanced
enough
at
the
midwinter
term
to
enter
the
junior
class
i
will
do
all
that
i
can
to
aid
her
but
this
dialect
which
she
now
speaks
must
be
overcome
and
that
means
tireless
prompting
on
the
part
of
some
constant
miss
gordon
also
arose
and
said
not
unkindly
give
doctor
winslow
s
protege
no
more
thought
until
the
midwinter
term
then
the
principal
added
with
a
brightened
smile
i
ll
prophesy
that
muriel
will
then
be
prepared
to
enter
your
sophomore
class
and
not
your
impossible
miss
humphrey
declared
with
conviction
wonders
never
cease
laughed
miss
gordon
who
now
wished
to
end
the
interview
but
who
will
tutor
muriel
storm
that
she
is
to
make
such
phenomenal
progress
with
her
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
open
door
miss
humphrey
awaited
the
answer
i
shall
miss
gordon
replied
joy
was
in
the
heart
of
the
island
girl
when
she
heard
this
wonderful
news
oh
i
m
that
glad
miss
gordon
she
exclaimed
the
following
evening
when
just
after
dinner
she
was
summoned
to
the
attractive
little
apartment
in
a
remote
wing
of
the
school
to
which
the
principal
retired
when
the
tasks
of
the
day
were
over
the
larger
of
the
two
rooms
was
a
library
and
study
in
which
there
was
a
wide
fireplace
and
on
either
side
long
windows
that
overlooked
the
hudson
low
shelves
circled
the
walls
and
they
were
filled
with
actually
read
and
loved
by
their
owner
here
and
there
were
copies
of
famous
paintings
and
a
few
charming
originals
in
water
color
too
there
were
ferns
growing
in
the
wicker
and
a
blossoming
plant
on
a
low
wicker
stand
the
comfortable
inviting
chairs
of
the
same
weave
were
cushioned
with
soft
hues
and
a
shade
on
the
reading
lamp
harmonized
the
little
room
just
beyond
in
which
miss
gordon
slept
had
disappearing
windows
on
all
sides
and
at
night
when
these
were
opened
only
the
screens
sheltered
her
from
the
she
so
loved
as
the
principal
had
prophesied
muriel
in
this
congenial
atmosphere
blossomed
not
only
rapidly
but
also
beautifully
no
one
but
faith
guessed
how
her
friend
was
advancing
and
she
did
not
have
to
guess
she
knew
miss
gordon
had
sent
for
faith
on
the
very
day
that
miss
humphrey
had
visited
the
office
and
together
they
had
divided
the
work
and
the
joy
of
assisting
muriel
in
the
beginning
the
principal
had
merely
planned
asking
faith
s
advice
it
had
not
been
her
desire
to
burden
the
girl
but
at
once
faith
had
said
oh
miss
gordon
i
have
not
told
you
that
for
the
past
two
weeks
i
have
been
instructing
muriel
in
penmanship
and
also
in
reading
and
spelling
it
is
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
aid
her
and
if
you
are
willing
i
shall
continue
our
little
the
principal
s
sweet
face
brightened
thank
you
faith
if
you
will
tutor
muriel
in
the
fundamentals
i
will
gladly
instruct
her
in
the
higher
then
she
added
and
there
was
a
twinkle
in
the
sweet
eyes
miss
humphrey
would
never
be
able
to
understand
it
but
i
actually
enjoy
reading
poetry
to
that
island
girl
she
sits
on
a
low
stool
at
my
feet
and
with
those
liquid
hazel
eyes
she
drinks
into
her
very
soul
the
beauty
of
the
thought
and
the
music
of
the
miss
gordon
faith
said
don
t
let
us
tell
anyone
of
muriel
s
progress
let
s
keep
it
a
secret
until
the
midwinter
term
i
would
like
to
surprise
miss
faith
was
thinking
of
marianne
whom
she
knew
wished
to
humiliate
muriel
chapter
xxviii
a
lesson
in
tennis
faith
and
muriel
were
studying
together
the
next
morning
which
chanced
to
be
saturday
when
they
heard
a
hurrying
of
feet
in
the
corridor
and
then
a
merry
banging
on
the
door
come
in
muriel
called
the
door
was
flung
open
and
in
bounced
gladys
goodsell
and
catherine
lambert
wearing
tennis
shoes
and
carrying
their
racquets
and
balls
top
o
the
morning
to
you
gladys
sang
out
the
coast
is
clear
catherine
announced
almost
at
the
same
time
the
two
who
were
seated
at
a
small
table
strewn
with
papers
and
books
looked
up
inquiringly
what
coast
and
how
clear
faith
inquired
gladys
threw
herself
down
upon
the
window
seat
while
catherine
perched
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
marianne
carnot
and
adelaine
stuart
have
gone
to
the
city
for
the
day
think
of
that
they
left
on
the
mail
boat
at
nine
o
clock
sharp
chaperoned
by
miss
widdemere
and
are
to
return
at
were
we
ever
in
greater
luck
still
the
listeners
were
puzzled
faith
morley
put
on
your
thinking
bonnet
don
t
you
know
that
we
have
been
just
pining
to
have
an
opportunity
to
instruct
muriel
in
the
beginnings
of
tennis
without
being
spied
upon
by
our
whatever
that
may
mean
anyway
it
sounds
much
grander
than
just
that
is
true
faith
replied
but
this
morning
muriel
and
i
were
planning
to
study
can
t
we
play
this
afternoon
faith
had
not
told
the
others
that
in
reality
she
was
trying
to
instruct
the
island
girl
in
spelling
the
simplest
words
but
muriel
was
quite
willing
that
these
two
dear
friends
might
know
and
so
she
said
teacher
faith
i
think
i
m
gettin
a
notion
of
what
you
mean
about
the
lesson
and
if
you
d
like
to
be
teachin
me
tennis
i
d
love
to
be
learnin
very
well
faith
said
as
she
arose
glad
indeed
to
join
in
the
outdoor
game
they
all
so
enjoyed
i
haven
t
a
thing
to
do
until
my
violin
lesson
at
three
o
clock
although
i
think
i
had
better
practice
for
an
hour
before
herr
professor
arrives
on
the
scene
today
last
saturday
he
said
mees
morley
the
practice
is
less
of
late
why
for
then
she
added
into
your
sport
skirt
muriel
and
if
you
haven
t
tennis
shoes
i
ll
loan
you
a
pair
i
ll
be
back
in
a
faith
skipped
away
to
her
room
to
change
her
dress
catherine
and
gladys
announced
that
they
would
go
ahead
to
the
court
and
practice
until
the
others
joined
them
ten
minutes
later
faith
reappeared
holding
a
pair
of
tennis
shoes
she
found
muriel
studying
the
primer
rilla
looked
up
with
laughter
in
her
hazel
eyes
she
announced
it
s
the
beginning
of
a
letter
i
wonder
how
long
twill
be
before
i
can
be
writin
one
that
a
person
could
be
readin
she
was
putting
a
burnt
orange
tam
atop
of
her
hair
as
she
spoke
and
then
she
slipped
on
a
sweater
of
the
same
becoming
hue
who
are
you
so
eager
to
write
to
anyway
faith
was
curious
oh
it
s
several
friends
i
have
that
i
d
like
to
be
writin
to
muriel
began
then
chancing
to
glance
at
the
chart
made
for
her
by
faith
to
aid
in
correcting
the
mistakes
she
so
frequently
made
she
repeated
very
slowly
and
thoughtfully
i
have
several
friends
to
whom
i
wish
to
that
s
great
faith
exclaimed
her
face
glowing
with
pleasure
think
ahead
of
each
word
that
you
say
for
a
few
weeks
dear
and
soon
you
will
find
that
it
will
be
hard
for
you
to
speak
then
slipping
her
arm
within
that
of
her
friend
she
added
the
champion
tennis
players
will
now
descend
to
the
faith
chatted
gaily
as
they
went
down
the
wide
stairs
out
through
the
basement
door
crossed
the
garden
where
few
flowers
were
blossoming
as
the
nights
were
frosty
and
toward
the
tennis
courts
muriel
however
was
silent
she
was
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
she
could
write
a
letter
to
gene
unaided
greetings
gladys
called
as
muriel
and
faith
approached
she
waved
her
racket
and
then
as
the
ball
sent
with
a
smash
by
catherine
landed
in
the
court
just
back
of
her
she
whirled
with
a
sudden
swift
movement
caught
it
on
the
first
bound
and
sent
it
flying
back
over
the
net
the
island
girl
stared
at
her
in
amazement
why
gladys
it
s
like
a
top
you
re
whirling
she
exclaimed
is
it
me
that
s
expected
to
learn
such
antics
the
other
three
laughed
and
catherine
catching
the
ball
walked
around
the
net
to
join
the
group
we
don
t
expect
you
to
do
such
expert
playing
as
that
for
this
tournament
faith
assured
her
in
fact
we
do
not
expect
you
to
take
part
in
any
of
the
actual
contest
games
until
next
spring
but
you
might
as
well
begin
your
training
it
s
jolly
good
fun
if
nothing
muriel
sighed
audibly
and
faith
laughed
rilla
she
said
and
the
island
girl
heard
her
s
pet
name
for
her
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
arrived
at
high
cliffs
have
you
been
worrying
for
fear
we
did
expect
you
to
play
against
marianne
carnot
on
that
fateful
day
indeed
not
catherine
lambert
is
the
only
pupil
in
this
school
who
can
even
approach
marianne
in
skill
and
dexterity
you
know
the
english
are
great
for
outdoor
sports
of
all
but
it
s
french
marianne
is
i
her
father
is
a
frenchman
but
he
is
connected
with
english
and
american
shipping
interests
it
s
a
huge
concern
i
don
t
know
just
what
but
i
have
heard
marianne
say
that
their
ships
circle
the
globe
because
of
this
monsieur
carnot
resides
in
england
where
his
daughter
attended
a
school
and
she
takes
every
opportunity
to
assure
us
it
was
really
intended
only
for
the
daughters
of
the
lesser
nobility
if
you
know
what
or
who
they
may
i
plead
total
ignorance
gladys
declared
i
m
glad
that
i
m
an
american
my
dad
made
every
penny
that
he
possesses
and
honestly
too
happened
to
own
vast
farmlands
which
the
city
of
new
york
wished
to
possess
and
for
which
it
paid
a
fabulous
price
hence
the
of
a
farmer
is
attending
high
cliffs
with
the
daughters
of
the
lesser
nobility
if
any
happen
to
be
catherine
lambert
laughed
well
since
we
four
are
not
guilty
let
s
cease
chatting
and
go
to
cathy
i
believe
you
are
trying
to
be
a
poet
faith
remonstrated
don
t
dear
we
d
hate
to
have
our
best
tennis
player
take
to
no
danger
of
that
i
simply
couldn
t
write
a
poem
if
my
life
depended
upon
it
now
let
s
explain
the
game
muriel
here
is
a
racket
for
catherine
looked
over
at
faith
who
smilingly
nodded
and
said
keep
up
the
good
work
cathy
if
you
leave
out
any
leading
points
gladys
and
i
will
supply
very
well
if
i
am
appointed
instructress
i
will
proceed
to
instruct
catherine
said
then
she
added
in
a
tone
of
mock
seriousness
miss
storm
before
you
is
a
tennis
court
the
boundaries
of
which
are
outlined
in
white
a
net
you
will
perceive
is
stretched
across
the
center
and
the
opponents
stand
two
on
either
side
comprenez
vous
then
noting
the
pupil
s
puzzled
expression
she
translated
do
i
make
it
clear
muriel
nodded
catherine
continued
the
first
player
to
serve
the
ball
is
selected
and
the
game
begins
now
the
object
of
the
server
is
to
send
the
ball
over
the
net
in
such
a
manner
that
it
will
be
difficult
for
the
opponent
to
reach
it
before
it
bounds
twice
it
may
be
returned
after
the
first
bounce
but
not
after
the
then
turning
to
the
others
now
shall
we
begin
muriel
will
learn
more
by
actual
practice
than
by
any
amount
of
explanation
i
will
take
her
for
my
oh
catherine
you
ll
be
sorry
if
you
do
muriel
laughingly
protested
no
she
won
t
faith
returned
catherine
could
win
the
game
singly
against
any
two
girls
in
this
school
if
marianne
were
not
an
then
the
game
began
gladys
served
and
the
ball
fell
easily
within
muriel
s
reach
but
she
stood
and
gazed
at
it
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
catherine
waited
then
realizing
that
muriel
did
not
understand
that
she
was
expected
to
return
the
ball
she
leaped
to
the
other
side
and
zip
it
went
flying
gracefully
back
over
the
net
after
that
it
was
kept
in
the
air
one
volley
shot
following
another
in
quick
succession
until
faith
had
the
misfortune
to
throw
it
into
the
net
then
they
all
paused
for
a
breathing
spell
muriel
shook
her
head
you
might
s
well
give
up
the
notion
of
teachin
me
such
spinnin
around
i
never
could
faith
laughed
don
t
be
discouraged
we
all
felt
just
that
way
in
the
beginning
now
gladys
let
s
sit
beneath
this
juniper
tree
and
let
muriel
get
some
actual
this
they
did
and
during
the
next
half
hour
muriel
did
some
leaping
and
running
that
made
the
observers
decide
that
when
she
understood
the
rules
of
the
game
she
would
play
at
least
as
well
as
the
majority
the
luncheon
bell
is
ringing
faith
sang
out
at
last
the
players
stopped
and
the
others
gazing
at
muriel
suddenly
realized
she
was
truly
beautiful
her
loosened
hair
clustered
in
moist
ringlets
about
her
flushed
face
her
orange
colored
tam
was
jauntily
askew
and
her
eyes
were
glowing
that
was
great
fun
she
said
when
the
garden
door
was
reached
thank
you
all
for
tryin
to
teach
chapter
xxix
joy
kiersey
that
had
been
the
first
of
many
hours
of
practice
on
the
tennis
courts
running
races
with
shags
and
rowing
had
been
the
only
two
outdoor
sports
muriel
had
known
for
that
reason
perhaps
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
tennis
and
how
her
friends
did
enjoy
watching
her
every
afternoon
from
four
to
five
o
clock
they
had
the
court
to
themselves
that
being
the
hour
when
marianne
carnot
was
practicing
her
vocal
lessons
on
the
other
side
of
the
school
these
three
friends
did
not
wish
marianne
to
even
suspect
that
muriel
was
being
drilled
not
that
they
had
any
hope
of
winning
the
game
which
was
but
a
fortnight
away
in
fact
it
would
be
unwise
to
permit
so
new
a
player
as
muriel
to
even
take
part
they
decided
joy
kiersey
who
usually
played
with
catherine
lambert
had
been
ill
and
was
not
yet
strong
enough
to
practice
although
she
assured
the
girls
that
she
would
not
fail
them
on
the
day
of
the
tournament
we
have
a
strong
team
faith
told
muriel
one
noon
at
lunch
when
joy
is
with
us
but
not
so
strong
when
she
isn
i
haven
t
met
joy
kiersey
as
yet
have
i
rilla
said
this
slowly
thoughtfully
and
hence
more
correctly
faith
was
pleased
but
made
no
comment
no
she
replied
joy
did
not
return
at
the
beginning
of
the
term
and
although
she
has
been
in
high
cliffs
for
a
week
now
she
remains
in
her
room
most
of
the
time
we
thought
that
we
would
call
upon
her
this
afternoon
during
the
free
period
and
i
planned
asking
you
to
accompany
muriel
shook
her
head
don
t
she
said
then
twinkles
appeared
in
her
clear
hazel
eyes
i
dunno
how
to
make
a
call
we
haven
t
had
that
yet
in
faith
however
did
not
smile
this
afternoon
dear
you
follow
me
and
do
just
what
i
do
and
then
at
least
you
will
be
as
correct
a
guest
as
i
miss
gordon
said
that
we
might
go
gladys
leaned
forward
to
remark
and
joy
is
eager
to
have
a
real
visit
with
we
haven
t
had
an
opportunity
since
she
came
to
confer
about
the
this
from
catherine
maybe
she
d
ruther
i
didn
t
faith
looked
reproachfully
at
her
friend
then
said
softly
that
no
one
else
might
hear
rilla
you
are
forgetting
our
new
rule
think
a
sentence
before
you
say
muriel
flashed
a
bright
smile
at
the
speaker
thought
a
moment
then
repeated
perhaps
your
friend
joy
kiersey
would
rather
that
i
did
not
not
so
faith
was
glad
to
be
able
to
add
truly
joy
asked
especially
about
you
she
was
watching
us
yesterday
as
we
returned
from
the
court
and
she
inquired
who
you
were
and
what
do
you
suppose
she
said
i
can
t
guess
something
dreadful
like
s
not
a
bit
of
it
joy
asked
who
the
girl
was
who
carried
herself
as
though
she
were
a
muriel
looked
blank
who
was
she
talking
about
if
twas
me
then
she
was
just
makin
no
dear
joy
wouldn
t
do
that
you
don
t
realize
it
of
course
but
there
are
times
when
you
carry
yourself
shall
i
say
proudly
faith
hesitated
groping
for
a
word
then
laughingly
confessed
i
don
t
know
just
how
to
express
as
though
she
had
a
family
tree
like
adelaine
stuart
gladys
put
in
muriel
laughed
then
said
earnestly
i
come
from
a
long
line
of
good
honest
new
england
seafaring
folk
and
i
m
proud
of
it
my
stood
erect
the
way
i
suppose
you
mean
that
i
do
summer
folk
often
spoke
of
it
i
remember
one
man
visitin
the
light
said
was
like
a
viking
queer
how
i
remembered
that
word
all
this
time
i
suppose
because
i
wondered
what
it
oh
i
know
all
about
vikings
gladys
boasted
listen
and
you
shall
hear
between
the
eighth
and
eleventh
centuries
the
coasts
of
the
british
isles
were
visited
by
the
norsemen
called
vikings
or
who
contributed
much
to
the
romantic
history
of
medieval
my
what
a
lot
we
know
catherine
lambert
teased
as
she
beamed
across
the
table
and
gladys
merrily
retorted
well
why
shouldn
t
i
know
it
today
since
i
only
learned
it
yesterday
but
don
t
ask
me
anything
about
it
next
then
as
the
signal
was
given
the
girls
arose
and
left
the
dining
hall
little
did
muriel
guess
that
these
dear
friends
had
planned
the
call
upon
joy
that
she
might
have
an
actual
experience
that
would
fit
her
for
the
dreaded
class
in
politeness
the
afternoon
tea
was
a
delightful
affair
joy
who
seemed
to
muriel
to
be
the
embodiment
of
loveliness
welcomed
them
to
her
sunny
room
with
a
graciousness
which
at
once
won
the
heart
of
the
island
girl
miss
joy
kiersey
may
i
present
my
friend
miss
muriel
storm
was
the
form
of
introduction
chosen
i
am
indeed
glad
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
so
dear
a
friend
of
our
faith
was
the
sincere
response
as
joy
extended
her
hand
and
clasped
that
of
the
new
member
of
their
little
clan
now
everybody
find
a
place
to
curl
up
somewhere
and
let
s
chat
for
half
an
hour
while
the
kettle
boils
dear
miss
gordon
granted
a
special
dispensation
today
and
yonder
on
the
tea
table
is
seen
the
flame
of
my
alcohol
lamp
that
will
soon
persuade
the
tiny
teakettle
to
start
its
oh
what
an
adorable
teakettle
that
is
i
love
copper
things
don
t
you
muriel
gladys
exclaimed
forgetting
for
the
moment
that
the
island
girl
might
not
be
familiar
with
things
antique
faith
replied
for
her
friend
then
added
joy
s
latest
hobby
it
is
quite
evident
is
collecting
baskets
you
have
a
dozen
new
ones
i
do
their
hostess
nodded
and
pointing
to
a
large
round
and
nearly
flat
basket
lying
near
the
hearth
i
found
that
in
nevada
last
summer
when
we
were
visiting
lake
tahoe
it
was
made
by
the
washoe
indians
and
i
think
that
i
prize
it
most
of
all
and
yet
that
washoe
water
bottle
on
the
mantel
is
interesting
as
a
after
the
basket
had
been
admired
gladys
asked
did
you
find
people
different
in
the
west
i
like
the
real
westerner
joy
replied
but
there
was
one
thing
that
was
always
like
a
discord
to
me
and
that
was
the
manner
of
introduction
used
by
many
of
them
they
say
meet
my
it
is
so
harsh
and
so
abrupt
if
they
would
say
i
would
like
you
to
meet
my
friend
it
would
seem
more
muriel
listening
resolved
that
she
would
never
use
that
crude
form
of
introduction
hark
catherine
lambert
said
softly
i
hear
a
voice
calling
to
joy
uncurled
from
the
big
chair
which
the
girls
had
insisted
that
she
occupy
oh
the
little
copper
teakettle
is
then
to
faith
will
you
pour
today
miss
morley
no
one
looked
at
muriel
and
as
she
did
in
all
things
as
her
friends
did
the
serving
of
tea
and
wafers
passed
without
a
mishap
when
the
bell
in
the
corridor
announced
the
hour
of
five
o
clock
faith
rose
time
to
depart
she
said
then
to
their
hostess
joy
i
am
so
glad
that
you
are
better
we
have
had
a
delightful
time
at
your
tea
party
and
shall
hope
to
see
you
soon
in
pickle
this
was
the
name
that
faith
jokingly
gave
the
room
that
she
shared
with
gladys
for
that
maiden
being
extremely
fond
of
sweet
pickles
always
had
a
bottle
of
them
stowed
away
in
most
unexpected
places
girls
joy
said
remorsefully
we
haven
t
made
a
single
plan
for
the
game
however
i
ll
be
at
the
court
tomorrow
at
as
faith
and
muriel
ascended
the
stairs
toward
the
cupola
room
whither
they
were
going
for
a
review
of
spelling
the
former
asked
isn
t
joy
a
dear
i
love
her
muriel
said
then
she
asked
are
you
sure
she
is
real
faith
turned
with
puzzled
eyes
real
do
you
mean
sincere
the
island
girl
shook
her
head
no
indeed
i
know
she
is
that
i
mean
that
she
looks
like
the
gold
and
white
fairy
folk
uncle
barney
used
to
tell
they
always
faith
smiled
joy
is
our
dresden
china
girl
and
oh
muriel
how
i
do
hope
she
will
grow
strong
her
mother
took
her
west
last
year
believing
the
invigorating
air
of
the
rockies
would
help
her
but
even
now
she
hasn
t
the
strength
that
we
who
love
her
desire
the
world
has
need
of
girls
like
our
joy
she
concluded
joy
kiersey
to
the
delight
of
her
friends
appeared
at
the
court
next
afternoon
her
soft
golden
hair
was
like
an
aureole
of
sunshine
about
her
head
for
when
she
began
to
play
she
tossed
her
pale
blue
tam
on
a
bench
where
earlier
she
had
flung
her
of
the
same
color
joy
and
catherine
played
singles
for
a
while
the
two
being
the
experts
of
the
team
faith
gladys
and
muriel
sat
nearby
watching
with
admiring
eyes
time
after
time
joy
was
able
to
smash
a
ball
over
the
net
in
such
a
manner
that
it
fell
dead
before
catherine
could
return
it
that
s
our
only
hope
faith
confided
to
muriel
that
play
of
joy
s
it
s
a
trick
that
her
harvard
brother
taught
her
and
watch
as
closely
as
we
may
we
can
not
acquire
it
her
brother
it
seems
made
joy
promise
that
she
would
not
teach
it
to
the
other
girls
unless
it
might
be
in
an
emergency
of
some
if
marianne
carnot
and
adelaine
stuart
are
to
play
against
joy
and
catherine
muriel
said
her
eyes
glowing
with
enthusiasm
they
will
have
to
be
wonderful
players
to
you
would
think
so
gladys
chimed
in
but
you
have
never
seen
marianne
run
she
seems
to
be
everywhere
at
once
it
doesn
t
matter
on
what
part
of
the
court
we
place
a
ball
there
that
french
girl
is
ready
to
return
it
often
with
a
volley
and
her
aim
is
true
however
joy
does
excel
in
the
smash
stroke
and
so
if
she
is
strong
enough
to
play
we
may
soon
joy
declared
that
she
wanted
to
rest
and
watch
while
the
others
played
faith
buttoned
the
girl
who
had
been
ill
into
her
blue
and
then
wrapped
a
soft
golden
scarf
about
her
although
joy
declared
that
she
did
not
need
it
you
re
warm
now
faith
told
her
but
there
s
a
decided
nip
in
the
air
today
and
we
must
be
careful
of
our
at
first
muriel
was
for
she
knew
that
joy
s
sweet
blue
eyes
were
watching
her
not
critically
but
with
interest
suddenly
however
her
attention
was
attracted
by
the
falling
of
the
ball
on
the
extreme
opposite
side
of
the
court
of
course
catherine
would
run
for
it
muriel
thought
but
when
she
saw
that
maiden
slip
muriel
ran
as
though
her
feet
were
shod
with
the
wings
of
the
wind
over
the
net
the
ball
went
and
catherine
was
ready
to
volley
it
back
when
gladys
returned
it
joy
wanted
to
shout
her
delight
how
she
longed
to
sing
out
girls
marianne
may
be
able
to
run
but
muriel
flies
but
instead
she
kept
very
quiet
she
saw
that
the
island
girl
was
beginning
to
forget
herself
and
she
did
not
wish
to
say
anything
that
would
cause
her
to
return
soon
joy
realized
that
she
had
her
own
strength
for
a
sense
of
weariness
was
creeping
over
her
she
rose
meaning
to
tell
the
girls
that
she
had
better
go
to
her
room
but
she
fell
back
on
the
bench
her
face
pale
joy
had
fainted
faith
rebuking
herself
for
having
permitted
the
frail
girl
to
play
at
all
was
quickly
at
her
side
as
were
the
others
joy
soon
opened
her
eyes
and
found
her
head
resting
on
faith
s
shoulder
i
m
sorry
if
i
frightened
you
she
said
then
with
a
sigh
she
concluded
i
guess
i
ll
have
to
give
up
trying
to
play
in
the
never
mind
joy
dear
we
would
far
rather
have
you
regain
your
strength
slowly
than
win
all
of
the
tennis
honors
that
could
come
to
us
faith
assured
her
with
the
assistance
of
loving
arms
joy
returned
to
the
school
and
was
soon
made
comfortable
in
her
padded
blue
silk
kimono
muriel
and
gladys
brought
wood
and
made
a
fire
on
the
hearth
while
catherine
went
kitchenward
to
fill
the
copper
teakettle
with
boiling
water
the
next
day
joy
felt
as
well
as
she
had
before
but
the
girls
were
unanimous
in
declaring
that
she
must
not
play
tennis
again
until
spring
then
it
was
that
joy
made
a
resolution
chapter
xxx
joy
s
secret
when
joy
realized
that
she
would
be
unable
to
play
in
the
tournament
which
was
the
formal
closing
of
the
tennis
season
at
high
cliffs
she
resolved
to
teach
muriel
the
trick
which
her
brother
had
taught
her
which
would
send
a
ball
over
the
net
with
a
smash
and
kill
it
before
it
bounced
the
island
girl
knew
the
rules
of
the
game
it
would
seem
and
how
light
she
was
on
her
feet
and
how
swift
if
she
could
master
that
trick
in
one
week
there
still
might
be
hope
of
winning
muriel
was
sitting
at
her
desk
studying
spelling
early
the
next
morning
when
there
came
a
tap
on
her
door
she
thought
it
was
the
maid
of
that
corridor
and
called
come
but
when
she
saw
the
blue
and
gold
apparition
standing
in
the
open
doorway
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
held
out
both
hands
oh
joy
she
exclaimed
it
is
good
of
you
to
come
to
see
me
do
you
think
you
re
strong
enough
to
be
walkin
that
far
the
visitor
sank
down
in
the
big
comfortably
upholstered
wicker
chair
near
the
hearth
where
a
bed
of
coals
glowed
i
feel
all
right
this
morning
she
said
but
after
yesterday
s
experience
i
am
convinced
that
i
am
not
strong
enough
as
yet
to
play
in
the
tournament
and
muriel
if
you
will
promise
not
to
share
the
knowledge
without
my
permission
i
will
teach
you
the
trick
that
my
brother
taught
muriel
s
hazel
eyes
were
wide
but
joy
she
ejaculated
why
is
it
me
you
would
be
teachin
when
faith
catherine
and
gladys
all
play
so
much
better
joy
smiled
as
she
replied
i
have
two
excellent
reasons
one
is
that
the
other
girls
are
busy
with
their
classes
nearly
all
of
each
day
while
you
and
i
are
not
as
yet
i
have
not
started
the
regular
work
and
so
you
and
i
could
go
down
to
the
court
at
an
hour
when
it
would
be
unoccupied
my
other
reason
is
that
you
are
the
only
one
on
our
side
who
can
run
as
does
our
rival
marianne
muriel
flushed
with
pleasure
i
d
be
that
pleased
if
i
could
help
win
the
game
she
said
i
ll
gladly
try
though
i
m
not
expectin
to
be
able
to
learn
the
try
is
all
that
any
of
us
can
do
in
this
world
it
would
seem
joy
said
as
she
arose
i
see
that
you
are
studying
and
i
too
must
get
at
my
french
madame
van
de
heuton
is
helping
me
keep
up
with
the
class
as
mother
plans
a
visit
to
the
continent
next
summer
if
i
am
strong
joy
hesitated
then
continued
muriel
would
you
like
to
study
french
with
me
the
review
from
the
very
beginning
would
do
me
just
worlds
of
there
were
sudden
tears
in
the
eyes
of
the
island
girl
how
kind
you
all
are
to
be
helpin
me
she
said
adding
if
you
think
i
ll
be
needin
the
french
i
ll
indeed
you
will
need
it
some
then
joy
suggested
that
they
go
to
the
court
at
two
when
every
other
pupil
would
be
occupied
indoors
muriel
said
that
she
would
at
the
door
joy
turned
and
lifting
a
finger
slender
as
a
she
whispered
mums
the
word
don
t
even
tell
faith
will
you
luckily
the
court
was
hidden
from
the
school
by
a
group
of
evergreen
trees
and
so
no
one
observed
the
two
conspirators
that
afternoon
patiently
joy
explained
the
play
and
muriel
who
was
used
to
quick
thought
and
action
in
her
sailboat
was
an
apt
pupil
at
the
end
of
the
first
half
hour
joy
declared
that
practice
was
all
that
the
island
girl
needed
to
perfect
her
in
the
smash
stroke
meet
me
every
day
at
this
hour
her
instructress
said
as
they
returned
to
the
school
by
a
roundabout
path
keeping
their
rackets
well
hidden
with
each
succeeding
day
joy
s
pleasure
in
her
pupil
increased
she
did
not
have
to
expend
much
energy
herself
as
when
the
ball
fell
dead
she
merely
picked
it
up
and
tossed
it
over
the
net
at
first
muriel
succeeded
only
once
in
a
while
but
on
the
fifth
day
she
never
failed
and
yet
at
the
practice
hour
with
the
other
girls
not
once
did
rilla
betray
the
fact
that
she
knew
the
smash
stroke
joy
wanted
to
surprise
them
on
the
day
of
the
tournament
faith
gladys
and
catherine
wondered
why
joy
seemed
to
be
so
excited
about
the
coming
game
indeed
almost
jubilant
chapter
xxxi
the
tennis
game
a
glorious
autumn
day
dawned
and
great
was
the
excitement
at
high
cliffs
for
many
interesting
events
were
to
take
place
before
the
setting
of
the
sun
foremost
among
them
being
the
contest
for
the
tennis
championship
joy
had
told
the
three
with
whom
she
had
expected
to
play
that
she
wished
they
would
continue
their
plans
and
permit
muriel
to
take
her
place
catherine
lambert
had
stared
in
amazement
joy
she
exclaimed
you
don
t
think
that
muriel
storm
can
play
well
enough
to
enter
the
tournament
do
you
then
added
not
but
that
i
would
be
glad
indeed
to
play
with
muriel
but
since
she
has
had
scarcely
a
month
s
practice
i
merely
thought
her
hardly
well
enough
prepared
and
of
course
we
don
t
want
to
fail
so
completely
that
we
will
be
laughed
at
by
the
entire
joy
for
one
impulsive
moment
was
inclined
to
tell
cathy
the
whole
truth
but
her
better
judgment
prevailed
for
she
thought
it
very
possible
that
muriel
might
become
when
she
found
herself
playing
before
so
many
spectators
and
perhaps
forget
the
trick
she
had
so
recently
learned
after
all
it
would
be
better
not
to
praise
the
island
girl
s
playing
too
much
for
she
might
fail
joy
stood
looking
out
of
her
open
window
at
the
blue
hudson
for
a
long
thoughtful
moment
before
she
inquired
with
whom
are
you
planning
to
play
catherine
her
voice
showed
no
trace
of
the
disappointment
that
she
truly
felt
because
muriel
was
not
to
be
chosen
jane
wiggins
plays
very
well
indeed
was
the
reply
i
watched
her
for
half
an
hour
yesterday
while
she
was
practicing
on
the
court
she
doesn
t
really
belong
to
either
side
although
she
said
that
marianne
carnot
had
asked
her
to
substitute
she
is
to
sit
on
a
bench
nearby
and
be
ready
to
run
into
the
game
if
one
of
the
players
slips
or
wrenches
her
ankle
or
anything
of
that
sort
when
i
spoke
to
jane
she
said
that
she
had
not
really
promised
marianne
that
she
would
substitute
and
that
she
would
much
rather
play
in
the
joy
smiled
oh
course
cathy
dear
you
girls
are
to
do
the
playing
i
am
not
and
you
must
select
whoever
you
wish
but
i
had
hoped
that
you
would
want
muriel
to
play
with
suppose
we
place
muriel
on
the
bench
to
substitute
for
us
of
course
any
player
is
likely
to
slip
and
be
out
of
the
game
gladys
suggested
this
was
agreed
upon
and
to
joy
fell
the
task
of
telling
muriel
that
she
had
not
been
chosen
when
the
others
had
gone
joy
went
to
the
cupalo
room
and
knocked
muriel
she
found
was
already
dressed
in
the
short
skirt
and
bloomers
which
the
girls
of
high
cliffs
were
permitted
to
wear
for
their
outdoor
sports
what
is
it
joy
what
have
you
to
tell
me
rilla
asked
for
one
glance
at
the
lovely
face
of
their
dresden
china
girl
assured
her
that
something
was
wrong
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
she
heard
what
had
happened
oh
i
m
that
pleased
she
said
an
i
do
hope
you
re
not
mindin
but
i
most
couldn
t
sleep
last
night
with
worryin
about
the
games
i
was
so
afraid
that
our
side
would
lose
and
if
it
did
i
knew
that
it
would
be
my
fault
yesterday
i
happened
to
be
out
by
the
courts
and
saw
marianne
carnot
and
adelaine
stuart
practicin
and
such
playin
as
they
can
then
peering
into
the
troubled
blue
eyes
of
her
friend
in
the
same
coaxing
way
that
she
had
often
peered
under
the
shaggy
grey
brows
of
her
she
said
please
forgive
me
joy
for
bein
glad
about
it
since
you
ve
tried
so
hard
to
teach
me
the
stroke
an
if
you
re
wishin
it
i
will
sit
on
the
bench
and
be
substitute
but
i
haven
t
much
hope
of
our
side
winnin
since
i
saw
those
two
with
this
arrangement
joy
had
to
be
content
and
she
went
back
to
her
room
to
dress
not
as
one
of
the
players
but
in
her
warm
coat
since
she
was
just
to
stand
around
and
watch
for
the
air
was
invigoratingly
cold
although
the
bloomer
suits
worn
by
the
players
all
were
a
light
tan
their
tams
and
were
of
various
colors
many
eyes
followed
the
dark
handsome
french
girl
whose
chosen
hue
was
that
of
a
cherry
she
knew
that
it
was
most
becoming
to
her
but
since
there
were
no
lads
about
to
impress
she
cared
little
what
manner
of
appearance
she
might
be
making
however
she
did
want
to
win
the
game
by
fair
means
or
foul
since
her
opponents
were
the
girls
who
had
befriended
muriel
storm
the
one
person
in
the
whole
world
whom
she
wished
to
humiliate
marianne
lifted
her
finely
arched
black
eyebrows
ever
so
slightly
as
she
glanced
across
the
net
to
the
spot
near
the
evergreens
where
the
five
opponents
were
gathered
have
they
chosen
muriel
storm
for
substitute
she
inquired
her
voice
expressing
her
mingled
surprise
and
amazement
they
must
be
courting
but
how
can
she
play
at
all
this
from
adelaine
stuart
i
have
never
seen
her
practicing
on
these
courts
and
surely
before
she
came
she
had
no
opportunity
to
marianne
shrugged
her
shoulders
let
us
rejoice
that
they
have
chosen
her
although
of
course
they
may
not
need
a
substitute
but
if
they
do
it
will
mean
an
easy
victory
for
more
honor
though
if
we
had
good
players
to
defeat
i
should
think
phyllis
dexter
ventured
but
there
was
no
time
for
further
conversation
as
miss
widdemere
who
was
to
keep
score
had
arrived
and
was
calling
the
names
of
the
first
four
who
were
to
take
their
places
and
select
the
server
five
games
were
to
be
played
and
the
side
winning
three
out
of
five
would
be
proclaimed
champion
although
jane
wiggin
was
a
fairly
good
player
she
had
not
practiced
with
catherine
and
was
greatly
handicapped
thereby
and
the
opponents
easily
won
the
first
game
marianne
scarcely
noticed
when
her
few
admirers
among
the
watchers
clapped
and
shouted
the
victory
had
been
too
easy
to
be
flattering
she
thought
the
next
game
was
played
by
gladys
and
faith
on
one
side
and
by
two
of
marianne
s
friends
on
the
other
and
there
was
far
more
enthusiasm
among
the
spectators
when
catherine
s
side
won
a
victory
jane
wiggin
knowing
that
it
was
her
poor
teamwork
that
had
lost
the
first
game
sincerely
wished
that
she
had
not
agreed
to
play
at
all
but
it
was
too
late
to
withdraw
though
she
did
her
best
and
though
it
was
a
game
catherine
s
side
lost
the
score
stood
two
games
for
marianne
and
one
for
catherine
joy
made
her
way
among
the
onlookers
and
sat
on
the
substitute
s
bench
next
to
muriel
oh
if
only
i
had
my
bloomers
on
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
would
take
jane
s
place
even
if
i
had
to
stay
in
bed
for
a
week
but
in
these
long
skirts
i
just
couldn
t
run
so
there
is
no
use
as
she
spoke
she
glanced
at
the
face
of
her
friend
and
saw
that
she
was
intently
watching
every
play
being
made
by
gladys
and
faith
who
as
before
upheld
the
honor
of
their
side
and
again
won
two
games
for
each
side
but
of
course
since
jane
was
to
play
in
the
fifth
catherine
s
group
had
no
hope
of
final
victory
jane
knew
this
as
well
as
did
the
others
and
she
was
so
nervous
when
she
took
her
place
on
the
court
that
she
could
barely
hold
her
racket
it
was
her
turn
to
serve
and
she
batted
so
blindly
that
the
ball
fell
far
afield
then
to
the
surprise
of
the
onlookers
she
burst
into
tears
and
ran
from
the
court
and
toward
the
school
as
fast
as
she
could
go
for
a
moment
catherine
was
but
what
was
happening
muriel
had
leaped
to
the
court
that
had
been
so
unexpectedly
deserted
by
jane
and
had
served
the
ball
without
observing
the
sarcastic
smile
of
her
french
opponent
marianne
returned
the
serve
with
a
volley
expecting
to
see
the
island
girl
miss
but
instead
the
ball
was
returned
with
that
smash
stroke
which
had
made
joy
s
playing
famous
marianne
did
her
swiftest
running
but
before
she
reached
the
spot
the
ball
had
fallen
dead
and
did
not
bounce
amazed
the
french
girl
s
brows
contracted
and
for
the
next
few
moments
she
did
her
very
best
playing
but
time
after
time
muriel
smashed
the
ball
over
the
net
if
marianne
was
close
then
the
ball
fell
back
of
her
if
she
was
on
the
outer
edge
of
the
court
then
the
ball
just
cleared
the
net
the
spectators
crowded
near
there
was
a
breathless
interest
what
could
it
mean
no
one
at
high
cliffs
knew
the
stroke
except
joy
kiersey
suddenly
a
light
dawned
upon
faith
joy
had
taught
muriel
her
trick
stroke
and
that
was
why
she
had
been
so
disappointed
when
jane
wiggin
had
been
asked
to
play
a
shout
arose
from
the
onlookers
and
there
was
a
sudden
rush
toward
the
island
girl
and
everyone
was
congratulating
her
muriel
had
won
the
game
and
once
more
marianne
had
been
defeated
by
une
chapter
xxxii
wainwater
castle
on
the
day
that
muriel
was
winning
the
tennis
tournament
gene
beavers
sat
in
the
library
of
their
home
on
the
outskirts
of
london
thinking
oh
to
be
near
the
hudson
now
that
indian
summer
is
it
was
a
glorious
morning
and
the
lad
was
tempted
to
go
for
a
longer
stroll
than
usual
when
his
sister
burst
in
with
oh
gene
something
wonderful
has
happened
you
couldn
t
guess
what
not
in
a
thousand
well
since
i
m
not
an
egyptian
mummy
there
isn
t
much
use
trying
was
the
smiling
response
but
his
thought
was
how
i
wish
it
were
that
muriel
storm
has
come
to
mother
is
overjoyed
helen
was
saying
it
s
the
one
thing
for
which
she
has
been
longing
and
yearning
ever
since
we
came
and
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
she
has
wished
it
into
existence
now
can
you
guess
the
lad
shook
his
head
i
m
not
much
good
at
riddles
sis
he
confessed
what
is
it
an
invitation
was
the
triumphant
announcement
as
helen
brought
the
hand
which
had
been
back
of
her
to
the
front
and
held
high
a
white
envelope
which
bore
a
crest
gene
sank
down
in
a
comfortable
armchair
the
interest
fading
from
his
face
is
that
all
he
asked
a
stupid
bore
i
would
call
it
how
you
women
folk
can
be
so
enthusiastic
about
invitations
to
receptions
and
teas
is
more
than
i
can
his
sister
sat
on
an
arm
of
his
chair
but
gene
she
said
you
have
often
wished
that
you
might
stroll
around
in
those
grounds
of
the
wainwater
the
lad
again
assumed
an
expression
of
interest
i
ll
agree
to
that
he
declared
they
are
wonderfully
alluring
several
times
when
i
have
been
out
for
a
stroll
i
have
gone
down
the
wainwater
road
and
have
paused
at
the
gate
in
the
high
hedge
to
gaze
in
among
the
trees
hoping
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
a
fawn
and
yesterday
i
saw
one
drinking
from
the
stream
such
a
graceful
beautiful
creature
and
it
looked
up
at
me
not
at
all
i
know
that
gate
helen
said
i
stood
there
a
moment
only
yesterday
but
what
i
especially
admired
was
the
picturesque
view
one
gets
of
the
home
which
is
at
least
a
quarter
of
a
mile
back
from
the
road
among
the
great
old
trees
i
have
read
about
such
places
with
galleries
where
ancestral
paintings
are
hung
and
i
d
just
love
to
see
the
inside
of
you
probably
will
never
have
the
opportunity
her
brother
began
but
he
was
interrupted
with
have
you
already
forgotten
this
wonderful
invitation
helen
again
held
up
the
crested
envelope
but
you
haven
t
told
me
to
what
or
by
whom
you
are
invited
the
lad
replied
we
all
of
us
are
invited
to
wainwater
castle
by
the
elderly
countess
herself
and
the
invitation
was
obtained
by
monsieur
then
noting
the
slight
frown
she
hurried
on
to
explain
you
know
dear
that
the
viscount
of
wainwater
really
controls
the
business
the
american
interest
of
which
our
father
represents
but
it
seems
that
his
honorable
lordship
if
that
is
what
he
is
called
is
more
interested
in
the
arts
and
leaves
the
direction
of
matters
financial
to
monsieur
then
noting
that
gene
had
turned
away
and
was
looking
rather
listlessly
out
of
the
window
his
sister
added
brother
dear
doesn
t
anything
interest
you
any
more
i
did
so
hope
that
you
would
be
glad
to
visit
this
beautiful
estate
with
mother
and
me
father
and
monsieur
carnot
will
be
unable
to
attend
and
we
counted
upon
you
to
escort
the
lad
looked
up
with
a
sudden
brightening
smile
rising
he
slipped
an
arm
about
the
girl
as
he
said
lovingly
your
brother
isn
t
much
of
a
social
ornament
but
he
ought
to
be
glad
indeed
that
his
mother
and
sister
really
want
his
the
girl
looked
pityingly
into
the
pale
face
that
had
been
tanned
and
ruddy
with
health
on
that
long
ago
day
when
she
had
visited
him
on
windy
island
impulsively
she
took
both
his
hands
brother
she
said
it
was
wrong
of
mother
to
make
you
leave
america
just
when
you
were
well
again
and
all
because
you
were
enjoying
the
friendship
of
a
and
his
some
day
i
shall
tell
mother
the
truth
which
is
that
you
and
i
both
hate
hate
all
this
catering
to
and
aping
after
the
english
then
inconsistently
she
added
nevertheless
i
curious
to
see
the
inside
of
the
wainwater
mansion
however
if
an
english
nobleman
asks
me
to
marry
him
i
shall
reply
that
i
prefer
an
this
last
was
called
merrily
over
her
shoulder
as
she
left
her
brother
who
though
amused
heartily
endorsed
her
sentiment
beavers
who
had
been
greatly
elated
by
the
invitation
which
she
had
received
from
the
countess
of
wainwater
obtained
all
the
information
she
believed
they
would
require
being
americans
they
of
course
did
not
know
the
correct
way
of
addressing
an
elderly
countess
and
her
son
the
viscount
they
had
a
private
rehearsal
the
evening
before
the
great
event
which
amused
the
young
people
mumsie
helen
said
gleefully
this
reminds
me
of
the
birds
christmas
carol
when
those
adorable
irish
children
were
drilled
in
manners
before
attending
a
dinner
party
then
to
give
them
a
proper
sense
of
family
pride
didn
t
their
mother
say
and
don
t
forget
that
your
father
was
a
policeman
beavers
did
not
smile
helen
dear
it
is
very
important
that
we
know
the
proper
thing
to
do
and
say
on
all
occasions
was
her
only
reply
the
next
afternoon
as
they
were
being
driven
to
the
wainwater
home
beavers
looked
admiringly
at
helen
and
gene
any
mother
even
a
countess
might
be
proud
of
them
she
assured
herself
however
being
americans
they
did
not
seem
to
be
as
greatly
impressed
with
the
fact
that
they
were
to
visit
a
peer
of
the
realm
as
this
particular
mother
might
wish
helen
had
been
just
as
elated
when
she
was
on
the
way
to
see
an
old
historical
ruin
and
as
for
gene
beavers
glanced
at
him
apprehensively
he
did
not
seem
to
be
even
thinking
of
the
honor
which
had
been
conferred
upon
them
indeed
whenever
his
mother
beheld
that
dreamy
expression
in
his
eyes
she
feared
that
he
was
thinking
of
that
dreadful
girl
the
s
nor
was
she
wrong
at
that
moment
gene
was
wondering
what
muriel
might
be
doing
and
resolved
to
write
her
upon
his
return
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
was
a
glorious
golden
afternoon
in
october
the
windows
of
the
castle
were
darkened
and
the
salon
within
was
brilliantly
lighted
and
thronged
with
fashionably
dressed
gentry
from
the
countryside
and
from
london
when
the
arrival
of
the
beavers
was
announced
the
elderly
countess
as
gene
afterwards
said
would
be
just
his
ideal
of
a
lovable
grandmother
if
she
could
be
transplanted
to
a
new
england
fireplace
and
away
from
so
much
grandness
there
was
indeed
an
amused
twinkle
in
the
sweet
eyes
of
the
little
old
lady
who
during
the
first
hour
sat
enthroned
not
being
strong
enough
to
stand
and
receive
gene
was
idly
watching
the
colorful
scene
about
him
feeling
weary
indeed
and
almost
stifled
with
the
fragrance
of
flowers
and
perfumes
when
he
felt
rather
than
saw
that
the
countess
was
watching
him
glancing
toward
her
he
found
that
he
had
been
right
for
she
was
beckoning
to
him
quickly
the
lad
went
to
her
side
and
in
her
kind
grandmotherly
way
she
said
dear
boy
you
look
very
tired
why
not
go
out
in
the
park
for
a
while
perhaps
you
will
find
there
my
son
he
will
be
glad
to
meet
you
follow
the
stream
to
a
gene
thanked
the
dear
little
old
lady
for
her
suggestion
and
after
telling
his
mother
and
sister
his
plan
he
went
out
he
soon
forgot
the
brilliantly
lighted
salon
in
his
joy
at
being
alone
once
again
with
nature
he
had
been
ill
so
long
that
as
he
looked
back
over
the
days
and
months
they
seemed
to
stretch
behind
him
illimitably
and
grey
except
where
they
were
made
golden
by
his
dreams
of
muriel
dear
brave
wonderful
muriel
gene
knew
now
all
that
had
happened
the
death
of
captain
ezra
the
who
had
been
so
kind
to
him
and
about
the
fashionable
boarding
school
to
which
doctor
lem
had
sent
his
protege
the
kindly
physician
had
received
a
note
from
gene
one
day
stating
that
since
he
never
heard
from
muriel
he
would
greatly
appreciate
it
if
from
time
to
time
he
would
write
and
tell
him
of
the
island
girl
it
had
not
been
hard
for
the
older
man
to
read
between
the
lines
and
he
had
replied
at
once
telling
all
that
had
happened
to
muriel
but
only
the
pleasant
part
of
the
letter
from
doctor
lem
was
being
recalled
by
the
lad
as
he
followed
the
banks
of
a
stream
that
wound
its
picturesque
way
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
wooded
park
suddenly
gene
paused
surely
he
heard
the
notes
of
a
flute
he
peered
among
the
trees
but
saw
no
one
then
as
he
advanced
the
music
was
hushed
and
he
decided
that
perhaps
it
had
been
the
song
of
a
hermit
thrush
there
was
a
dense
growth
of
evergreen
trees
just
ahead
of
him
they
crowded
so
close
to
the
edge
of
the
water
that
the
lad
paused
thinking
that
he
would
better
go
back
but
noticing
a
wet
mossy
rock
near
he
stepped
out
upon
it
and
to
his
delight
saw
just
beyond
the
pines
the
rustic
cabin
of
which
the
countess
had
spoken
eager
and
interested
the
lad
half
ran
up
the
path
soft
with
pine
needles
and
tapped
upon
the
door
wondering
if
the
cabin
were
deserted
come
in
a
deep
voice
called
gene
opened
the
door
and
entered
a
large
square
rustic
room
which
seemed
to
be
both
a
hunting
lodge
and
a
den
a
man
whose
face
seemed
too
young
for
its
crowning
of
grey
was
lounging
in
a
deep
comfortable
chair
in
front
of
a
wide
fireplace
on
which
a
log
was
burning
he
wore
a
crimson
velvet
jacket
and
he
was
reading
other
books
and
magazines
were
placed
on
a
low
table
near
too
there
was
a
flute
the
notes
of
which
gene
had
heard
the
man
smiled
a
welcome
american
he
inquired
gene
said
that
he
was
good
motioning
to
a
chair
beyond
the
hearth
lost
was
the
next
question
no
sent
the
lad
replied
then
seated
himself
and
told
how
he
chanced
to
be
there
my
lady
mother
must
have
thought
that
you
and
i
would
like
to
know
each
other
the
man
said
you
are
the
son
of
our
american
representative
yes
eugene
beavers
also
is
the
name
of
my
fine
man
then
you
ve
been
ill
a
long
time
breakdown
in
or
the
older
man
asked
this
with
a
quizzical
smile
both
perhaps
neglected
books
while
training
for
the
big
game
then
broke
down
cramming
for
midwinter
like
london
no
i
think
it
s
the
englishman
laughed
that
doesn
t
sound
american
what
place
do
you
like
better
tunkett
then
it
was
the
turn
of
the
lad
to
laugh
that
place
of
course
means
nothing
to
you
it
isn
t
even
on
the
map
just
a
fishing
the
viscount
leaned
forward
and
with
the
iron
tongs
moved
the
position
of
the
log
that
it
might
burn
faster
his
next
remark
astonished
the
lad
who
thought
he
never
had
met
a
man
he
liked
better
come
over
here
gene
beavers
and
spend
a
week
with
me
or
better
still
we
might
take
a
hiking
trip
through
honest
injun
the
lad
s
face
glowed
eagerly
boyishly
honest
thus
was
begun
a
friendship
between
the
viscount
of
wainwater
and
gene
beavers
people
marveled
at
it
for
though
many
sought
the
friendship
of
the
viscount
few
were
permitted
to
enter
the
seclusion
in
which
he
chose
to
live

over
her
shoulder
at
the
newcomer
for
she
was
on
the
hearth

roasting
marshmallows
over
the
fire
who
of
our

happy
if

so
eager

joy

merrily
from
faith
the
golden
head
shook
in
the

i
adore
writing
poems
she
confessed
i
wrote
dozens
of
them
last
summer
but
then
the
scenery
in
colorado
and
along
lake
tahoe
would
have
inspired
a
stump
to
write
a
month
had
passed
since
the
tennis
tournament
and
joy
s
strength
had
returned
to
her
almost
miraculously
and
to
the
delight
of
her
friends
she
was
able
to
join
them
in
their
daily
tramps
across
the
snowy
fields
and
she
had
even
suggested
a
coasting
party
for
the
first
moonlight
night
too
she
had
taken
her
place
in
the
classes
and
was
going
ahead
of
the
others
as
she
always
did
when
she
was
strong
enough
to
really
study
catherine
lambert
looked
up
from
the
mysterious
pink
thing
upon
which
she
was
sewing
it
s
a
christmas
gift
was
all
that
she
would
tell
about
it
in
fact
all
were
sitting
about
the
lamp
in
muriel
s
room
that
stormy
friday
night
sewing
upon
gifts
equally
pretty
and
mysterious
that
is
all
except
gladys
their
youngest
who
said
that
her
fingers
were
thumbs
when
it
came
to
sewing
and
that
she
would
far
rather
sit
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
and
roast
marshmallows
one
by
one
she
placed
the
delicious
golden
puffs
upon
a
warm
plate
and
when
there
was
a
goodly
heap
of
them
she
arose
saying
put
away
your
sewing
girls
and
partake
of
the
refreshments
for
which
i
have
spent
the
last
nickle
i
will
have
until
my
christmas
money
poor
gladys
laughed
joy
as
she
perched
upon
the
arm
of
the
chair
in
which
muriel
was
seated
the
island
girl
glanced
up
with
a
softening
light
in
her
eyes
as
she
felt
the
caress
upon
her
hair
how
close
these
two
had
grown
in
the
last
month
not
that
muriel
s
love
for
faith
had
lessened
in
fact
all
of
these
five
girls
were
very
dear
to
each
other
and
yet
between
joy
and
muriel
who
were
so
unlike
there
was
growing
a
love
the
strength
of
which
even
they
hardly
knew
joy
exquisite
dainty
and
as
jubilant
as
her
name
suggested
had
been
surrounded
from
babyhood
with
every
luxury
while
muriel
had
known
but
the
bare
necessities
whose
names
are
entered
faith
asked
as
she
put
her
sewing
into
a
dainty
workbag
and
took
one
of
the
marshmallows
joy
counted
them
off
on
her
fingers
dorothy
daggert
first
and
foremost
and
since
she
is
a
senior
and
always
wins
in
everything
that
she
writes
there
will
be
little
hope
for
any
of
the
rest
of
us
four
others
in
the
senior
class
have
entered
two
in
the
sophomore
and
girls
what
do
you
think
one
of
them
is
marianne
carnot
faith
s
expression
registered
astonishment
you
must
be
mistaken
she
said
marianne
is
in
my
class
and
she
never
writes
verse
even
when
we
may
choose
the
form
for
our
miss
gordon
had
entered
muriel
s
name
as
one
competing
and
it
was
because
of
this
fact
as
yet
unknown
to
either
rilla
or
joy
that
marianne
carnot
had
also
entered
her
name
miss
gordon
looked
up
brightly
one
evening
a
fortnight
later
when
she
heard
a
familiar
tap
on
the
door
of
her
little
apartment
good
evening
muriel
she
said
in
response
to
the
greeting
from
the
girl
who
had
entered
i
have
some
news
for
you
can
you
guess
what
it
is
no
miss
gordon
unless
and
the
hazel
eyes
were
eager
uncle
lem
is
coming
for
that
not
that
the
older
woman
smiled
however
i
have
a
letter
from
doctor
winslow
and
in
it
he
assures
us
both
that
just
as
soon
as
his
duties
will
permit
he
shall
avail
himself
of
our
invitation
the
news
has
something
to
do
with
your
school
muriel
had
taken
her
usual
seat
a
low
rocker
on
the
side
of
the
fireplace
opposite
her
teacher
miss
gordon
looking
at
the
truly
beautiful
face
of
the
girl
and
at
the
soft
crown
of
hair
that
was
like
burnished
copper
in
the
glow
of
the
firelight
felt
more
than
ever
convinced
that
muriel
had
inherited
much
from
that
unknown
father
am
i
to
be
placed
in
one
of
the
classes
there
was
almost
dread
in
the
voice
that
asked
the
question
miss
gordon
laughed
your
expression
dear
is
not
complimentary
to
miss
humphrey
but
truly
muriel
she
is
wonderfully
kind
beneath
her
nervous
flustery
manner
but
it
isn
t
that
i
am
too
selfish
to
give
up
teaching
you
if
you
are
satisfied
with
your
present
tutor
i
assure
you
i
am
more
than
pleased
with
my
tears
sprang
to
the
hazel
eyes
the
girl
leaned
forward
her
expressive
face
telling
more
than
words
could
i
ll
study
that
hard
and
be
as
little
trouble
as
i
can
if
only
you
ll
keep
me
just
this
year
out
miss
then
she
inquired
now
may
i
know
the
news
it
is
about
the
poetry
contest
that
i
was
thinking
when
you
came
in
i
have
been
looking
over
the
poems
that
have
entered
and
although
several
are
good
i
believe
that
your
verses
to
a
lonely
pelican
are
best
but
of
course
as
you
know
dear
i
am
not
to
be
the
who
is
miss
gordon
muriel
asked
an
old
friend
of
mine
who
is
professor
of
english
in
columbia
university
the
poems
are
to
be
sent
him
unsigned
and
he
will
decide
which
reveals
the
most
she
was
looking
over
a
dozen
neatly
written
contributions
to
the
contest
as
she
spoke
taking
one
from
among
them
the
older
woman
smiled
at
the
girl
muriel
she
said
i
am
surprised
to
see
how
prettily
joy
kiersey
can
write
verse
this
plaint
of
a
washoe
indian
maid
who
yearns
for
the
days
when
her
wigwam
home
was
beside
the
lake
that
bears
her
name
and
for
the
young
indian
brave
who
came
to
her
in
a
bark
canoe
across
the
waters
shows
feeling
and
is
artistically
done
i
believe
that
it
will
win
second
oh
miss
gordon
muriel
s
voice
was
eager
may
i
withdraw
my
you
think
it
might
win
the
older
woman
looked
up
amazed
dear
she
said
not
understanding
this
unusual
request
may
i
know
your
reason
i
want
joy
to
win
she
loves
to
write
verse
and
she
said
it
would
please
her
dad
he
thinks
it
is
wonderful
because
his
daughter
is
talented
he
is
so
plain
just
a
business
man
without
a
bit
of
the
artist
in
his
miss
gordon
had
surmised
that
a
very
tender
love
was
binding
these
two
girls
each
day
closer
and
closer
and
yet
she
hardly
thought
it
fair
to
permit
muriel
to
make
the
sacrifice
joy
she
knew
would
not
wish
it
has
marianne
carnot
entered
a
poem
yet
the
island
girl
asked
miss
gordon
s
expression
was
hard
to
interpret
no
and
i
very
much
doubt
her
doing
so
she
had
just
said
when
there
came
a
tap
on
the
door
muriel
answered
the
summons
a
maid
stood
there
with
a
rolled
manuscript
it
s
for
miss
gordon
she
said
mam
selle
carnot
asked
me
to
bring
a
moment
later
miss
gordon
looked
up
from
the
finely
written
contribution
muriel
she
announced
you
will
not
need
to
withdraw
your
poem
for
this
is
by
far
the
best
it
is
marked
original
and
though
i
marvel
at
it
i
may
not
question
the
honor
of
a
pupil
of
high
cliffs
a
week
from
today
we
will
know
whose
poem
has
been
awarded
the
chapter
xxxiv
marianne
wins
the
prize
i
can
t
understand
it
in
the
least
and
what
s
more
i
don
t
believe
it
s
this
from
catherine
lambert
who
sat
on
a
low
bench
buckling
her
skates
the
tennis
courts
had
been
flooded
and
the
shining
blue
expanse
of
ice
delighted
the
girls
of
high
cliffs
who
enjoyed
outdoor
frolics
but
cathy
miss
gordon
herself
made
the
announcement
and
who
are
we
to
deny
it
faith
remonstrated
however
as
i
said
before
i
never
knew
marianne
carnot
to
write
verse
and
when
one
is
a
natural
poet
one
scribbles
in
rhyme
all
of
the
muriel
and
joy
were
skating
toward
the
bench
their
faces
flushed
beneath
their
jaunty
tams
that
s
fine
sport
rilla
declared
as
they
glided
up
at
least
i
can
stand
now
thanks
to
the
patience
of
all
of
you
girls
but
i
never
will
be
content
until
i
can
do
the
whirls
and
figure
eights
as
well
as
laughingly
cathy
held
out
her
hands
come
i
ll
give
you
a
lesson
but
gladys
detained
them
saying
shall
we
tell
the
girls
the
bad
news
bad
news
on
a
day
as
sparkling
as
this
joy
began
then
as
she
glanced
from
one
face
to
another
she
exclaimed
i
know
what
it
is
you
have
heard
who
has
won
the
poetry
have
you
really
this
eagerly
from
muriel
how
she
did
hope
that
the
prize
had
been
awarded
to
joy
but
remembering
what
miss
gordon
had
said
she
almost
knew
the
name
that
she
would
hear
girls
catherine
lambert
said
emphatically
i
m
just
sure
that
marianne
carnot
is
a
faith
put
a
warmly
gloved
hand
on
the
arm
of
her
friend
that
s
a
very
serious
accusation
cathy
i
really
do
not
think
that
we
ought
to
make
it
unless
we
have
more
evidence
than
we
have
at
catherine
whirled
about
and
her
dark
eyes
flashed
i
suppose
you
d
stand
by
and
see
your
best
friends
cheated
out
of
the
prize
rather
than
call
that
snobbish
french
girl
a
thief
which
she
is
of
course
if
she
has
copied
that
poem
and
presented
it
as
her
we
will
have
to
prove
it
first
i
think
faith
replied
quietly
but
catherine
who
was
not
at
all
meek
retorted
well
how
are
we
going
to
prove
it
of
course
she
is
too
clever
to
copy
one
of
tennyson
s
or
any
other
poem
with
which
we
are
all
familiar
now
i
think
the
way
for
miss
gordon
to
find
out
the
truth
of
this
matter
would
be
to
lock
marianne
in
a
classroom
and
tell
her
she
will
have
to
stay
there
until
she
writes
another
poem
of
equal
gladys
laughed
poor
marianne
she
would
be
in
there
for
the
rest
of
her
natural
life
i
fear
genius
doesn
t
work
that
way
there
was
a
pupil
here
two
years
ago
who
composed
music
and
said
the
inspiration
came
to
her
at
the
queerest
hours
once
she
went
to
the
music
room
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
poor
miss
humphrey
who
slept
just
above
was
terribly
frightened
she
thought
the
music
room
was
haunted
maybe
marianne
is
the
same
way
maybe
she
has
had
the
one
inspiration
of
her
the
dark
eyes
of
catherine
flashed
toward
gladys
scornfully
since
when
have
you
taken
to
championing
marianne
carnot
perhaps
you
would
like
to
be
numbered
among
her
friends
gladys
flushed
and
was
about
to
retort
when
joy
laughingly
exclaimed
what
a
tempest
in
a
teapot
we
are
trying
to
brew
then
more
seriously
if
marianne
wins
the
prize
unfairly
her
own
heart
will
punish
her
now
i
suggest
that
we
all
take
hands
and
play
cartwheel
on
the
ice
until
the
gong
half
an
hour
later
flushed
and
warm
they
were
trooping
back
to
the
school
when
little
peggy
paterson
ran
out
to
meet
them
calling
muriel
storm
miss
widdemere
wants
you
to
stop
at
her
office
before
you
go
to
your
room
the
mail
just
muriel
s
heart
leaped
would
there
be
a
letter
from
gene
there
were
two
letters
for
muriel
bearing
foreign
postmarks
one
of
them
was
addressed
in
a
writing
strange
to
the
girl
and
she
tore
it
open
almost
with
dread
but
this
was
quickly
changed
to
joy
for
the
letter
was
from
her
dear
uncle
barney
the
good
priest
had
written
it
for
him
as
he
did
so
want
rilly
to
know
that
heaven
willing
he
and
his
old
mother
would
sail
for
america
in
the
spring
it
s
lonely
i
am
for
a
look
at
me
gal
an
it
s
lonely
i
am
for
me
cabin
down
by
the
sea
an
it
s
lonely
me
cabin
has
been
this
long
spell
closed
there
for
me
the
letter
ran
the
sympathetic
young
priest
who
had
been
scribe
had
written
the
letter
just
as
the
kindly
old
irishman
had
dictated
it
and
it
sounded
so
like
her
beloved
uncle
barney
that
for
a
moment
it
was
hard
for
muriel
to
keep
from
crying
twill
be
a
different
place
that
he
ll
be
findin
she
thought
with
the
lighthouse
but
a
tumbled
down
heap
of
rocks
and
with
grandfather
gone
oh
i
m
that
glad
uncle
barney
s
coming
i
ll
ask
uncle
lem
to
take
me
to
tunkett
just
as
soon
as
they
are
then
muriel
opened
the
other
envelope
which
was
addressed
in
a
handwriting
with
which
she
was
familiar
as
gene
wrote
very
often
to
his
storm
dear
rilla
the
lad
had
written
such
an
adventure
as
i
have
had
at
last
the
dull
grey
monotony
of
living
in
england
has
ceased
for
i
have
met
the
most
interesting
man
and
for
some
reason
unknown
to
me
he
invites
my
companionship
i
really
can
t
believe
that
i
interest
him
for
all
i
do
is
listen
while
he
talks
so
wonderfully
about
everything
that
is
inside
books
and
out
if
there
is
one
corner
of
this
earth
that
he
hasn
t
visited
i
can
t
imagine
where
it
is
oh
yes
tunkett
i
don
t
suppose
he
has
ever
been
there
in
fact
it
s
such
an
place
i
don
t
suppose
anybody
ever
would
find
it
unless
he
happened
to
be
born
there
as
uncle
lem
was
and
i
of
course
went
to
visit
him
did
i
hear
you
inquire
who
is
your
new
friend
muriel
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
greatly
impressed
with
the
fact
that
he
is
a
viscount
people
over
here
treat
him
as
though
he
were
made
of
a
very
superior
kind
of
clay
my
mother
among
them
but
the
viscount
himself
isn
t
a
bit
flattered
by
the
adulation
he
receives
he
calls
it
tommyrot
and
whenever
there
are
social
functions
at
the
castle
honest
injun
rilla
that
s
what
they
call
the
turreted
stone
pile
in
which
he
lives
he
retires
to
his
rustic
log
cabin
in
the
woods
which
is
so
hedged
in
that
strangers
could
not
even
guess
that
it
was
there
unless
they
happened
to
stumble
on
it
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
about
the
man
himself
and
do
justice
to
him
but
i
simply
can
t
he
has
the
most
boyish
face
i
ever
saw
crowned
with
grey
hair
he
tells
me
that
he
is
years
old
but
he
seems
nearer
my
age
than
any
chap
of
twenty
i
ever
met
the
first
time
i
met
him
he
suggested
a
hike
through
scotland
it
seemed
a
good
deal
of
an
undertaking
for
i
wasn
t
very
strong
just
beginning
to
take
short
walks
but
every
day
i
grew
stronger
and
what
a
week
it
was
the
viscount
of
wainwater
with
a
pack
on
his
back
was
not
recognized
by
anyone
the
boy
in
his
nature
was
very
much
in
evidence
that
week
he
sang
as
we
tramped
along
the
deserted
highways
and
sometimes
i
knew
that
he
was
improvising
then
it
was
that
i
made
a
discovery
he
is
the
waine
waters
whose
vagabond
poems
so
often
appear
in
american
magazines
one
night
we
stopped
at
an
inn
we
had
been
tramping
over
a
moor
and
as
we
sat
near
the
great
fireplace
where
peat
was
burning
he
began
to
scribble
and
at
last
he
looked
up
and
asked
shall
i
read
it
to
you
i
nodded
and
muriel
that
poem
was
a
gem
it
was
called
the
moor
in
winter
and
told
of
the
quiet
trust
that
is
in
the
heart
of
all
nature
for
although
the
moor
lies
covered
with
snow
it
is
dreaming
of
the
spring
that
is
to
bring
back
the
bird
song
and
the
heather
i
asked
waine
he
told
me
to
call
him
that
for
a
copy
of
the
poem
and
he
gave
it
to
me
i
had
planned
sending
it
to
you
i
had
it
a
week
later
when
i
returned
i
took
it
to
the
library
to
show
mother
but
finding
that
monsieur
carnot
and
father
were
there
i
turned
away
i
have
never
seen
it
since
i
must
have
dropped
it
and
the
maid
probably
thought
it
merely
a
scrap
and
burned
it
i
ll
ask
waine
for
another
copy
some
day
but
just
now
with
his
countess
mother
he
has
gone
away
for
a
fortnight
isn
t
it
about
time
that
you
were
writing
a
first
letter
to
your
gene
beavers
p
have
never
mentioned
you
to
waine
but
if
you
are
willing
i
d
like
to
show
him
that
copy
of
the
lonely
pelican
which
doctor
winslow
sent
me
shall
i
y
scarcely
had
muriel
finished
reading
this
letter
when
joy
burst
in
with
rilla
miss
gordon
has
called
an
assembly
for
two
o
clock
this
afternoon
we
are
all
so
excited
for
this
is
only
done
on
very
especial
occasions
what
do
you
suppose
has
happened
i
wonder
if
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
contest
faith
said
softly
as
she
and
muriel
found
unoccupied
chairs
near
their
three
friends
who
were
already
seated
my
opinion
is
that
miss
gordon
merely
wishes
to
announce
the
name
of
the
winner
of
the
prize
and
as
we
would
not
again
be
assembled
until
monday
except
in
the
dining
hall
and
chapel
she
has
taken
this
method
of
bringing
us
and
joy
was
right
miss
gordon
s
smile
as
she
entered
with
miss
humphrey
and
miss
widdemere
was
so
pleasant
that
it
at
once
quieted
the
fears
of
the
senior
girls
that
something
had
gone
wrong
although
only
a
small
group
of
you
are
interested
in
the
poetry
contest
she
began
i
wish
you
all
to
hear
the
three
poems
that
have
been
pronounced
best
by
a
most
able
judge
who
is
the
professor
of
english
literature
at
columbia
the
first
prize
has
been
awarded
to
marianne
carnot
the
second
to
muriel
storm
and
the
third
to
joy
there
was
a
rustle
among
the
girls
all
of
whom
turned
to
look
at
the
honored
three
muriel
and
joy
were
not
surprised
at
the
announcement
that
the
winner
had
been
marianne
carnot
but
they
had
not
known
that
a
second
and
third
prize
had
been
offered
they
made
no
whispered
comment
however
as
miss
gordon
was
again
speaking
i
am
going
to
ask
the
three
girls
beginning
with
joy
then
muriel
and
then
marianne
to
come
to
the
platform
and
read
aloud
the
really
excellent
poems
which
they
have
faith
noticed
that
the
eyes
of
this
kind
principal
never
left
the
dark
handsome
face
of
the
french
girl
and
she
also
noticed
that
marianne
did
not
look
up
even
when
her
name
was
mentioned
after
all
faith
decided
the
meeting
had
a
deeper
purpose
than
that
for
which
it
had
been
called
joy
with
her
face
flushed
read
the
poem
which
she
really
knew
by
heart
so
sympathetically
and
the
plaint
of
the
indian
maid
so
appealed
to
her
listeners
that
they
wondered
how
the
other
two
poems
could
be
better
muriel
s
poem
although
showing
more
real
talent
was
not
read
as
well
and
the
pupils
were
still
inclined
to
believe
that
joy
s
should
at
least
have
had
second
place
now
faith
and
catherine
watched
the
french
girl
and
for
that
matter
so
did
miss
gordon
and
miss
humphrey
but
the
winner
of
the
first
prize
seemed
to
be
in
no
way
disconcerted
she
stood
up
and
her
dark
eyes
looked
directly
into
those
of
miss
gordon
as
she
took
the
manuscript
everyone
had
to
acknowledge
that
marianne
read
well
but
what
was
she
reading
from
the
very
announcement
of
the
title
muriel
had
leaned
forward
her
breath
coming
in
little
gasps
her
face
suddenly
pale
her
hands
clasped
tensely
marianne
having
read
her
poem
through
to
the
end
walked
down
the
aisle
between
the
girls
to
her
former
seat
but
she
could
not
resist
sending
a
glance
of
triumph
toward
muriel
the
clear
hazel
eyes
that
looked
back
at
her
were
scornful
and
accusing
marianne
quickly
seated
herself
a
deep
red
flush
suffusing
her
face
within
her
heart
was
the
certainty
that
muriel
knew
but
how
could
she
and
muriel
did
know
for
the
title
of
the
poem
which
marianne
had
read
was
winter
on
the
muriel
left
the
other
girls
directly
after
the
meeting
and
hurried
to
her
own
room
she
wanted
to
be
alone
to
think
but
this
she
was
not
permitted
to
do
almost
immediately
there
came
a
tap
on
her
door
and
faith
was
admitted
with
her
hands
on
the
shoulders
of
her
friend
she
looked
deep
into
the
hazel
eyes
tell
me
dear
she
said
i
will
keep
it
a
secret
if
you
wish
what
is
troubling
you
muriel
turned
and
taking
gene
s
letter
from
its
envelope
she
read
aloud
his
description
of
the
viscount
and
the
poem
by
waine
waters
entitled
the
moor
in
the
very
poem
that
won
the
prize
for
marianne
faith
exclaimed
her
father
must
have
found
and
sent
it
to
her
what
shall
you
do
about
it
marianne
will
of
course
be
expelled
when
the
truth
is
known
last
year
when
miss
gordon
enumerated
the
ideals
of
high
cliffs
she
mentioned
plagiarism
as
being
one
of
the
greatest
of
i
shall
not
mention
it
was
the
quiet
reply
now
let
us
forget
the
poetry
contest
was
soon
a
thing
of
the
past
for
everyone
was
thinking
and
planning
for
the
christmas
holidays
that
were
but
two
weeks
away
however
it
was
noticeable
that
marianne
carnot
never
again
chose
verse
as
the
form
of
her
compositions
her
classmates
were
not
interested
enough
to
speculate
about
it
but
miss
gordon
and
miss
humphrey
believed
that
some
day
they
would
know
the
truth
chapter
xxxv
muriel
writes
a
letter
meanwhile
muriel
had
a
problem
of
her
own
to
settle
she
had
been
invited
to
spend
the
holidays
in
the
homes
of
her
two
best
friends
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
as
she
wished
to
accept
both
invitations
but
that
of
course
was
impossible
then
it
was
that
the
matter
was
decided
for
her
in
a
most
unexpected
and
delightful
manner
doctor
winslow
had
been
a
frequent
sunday
visitor
at
the
school
for
was
not
his
protege
one
of
the
pupils
and
each
time
there
had
been
a
cozy
party
in
miss
gordon
s
charming
the
kindly
physician
had
noticed
an
expression
of
weariness
in
the
eyes
of
the
older
woman
as
though
the
responsibility
of
training
so
many
girls
was
bearing
heavily
upon
her
and
he
had
suddenly
decided
that
what
she
needed
was
a
complete
change
of
scene
and
as
he
had
often
heard
miss
gordon
express
a
desire
to
visit
tunkett
he
offered
his
home
to
her
and
to
muriel
for
the
midwinter
vacation
assuring
them
that
he
had
already
communicated
with
his
housekeeper
who
lived
in
a
neighboring
cottage
and
that
both
brazilla
mullet
and
her
brother
jabez
would
look
after
their
every
comfort
muriel
was
seated
in
her
low
chair
on
the
side
of
the
fireplace
opposite
miss
gordon
when
that
little
woman
her
eyes
glowing
her
cheeks
faintly
flushed
read
aloud
the
letter
which
she
had
received
from
the
brother
of
her
classmate
oh
miss
gordon
shall
we
go
how
wonderful
it
would
be
muriel
exclaimed
you
ll
just
love
tunkett
and
the
dear
queer
people
of
course
they
don
t
seem
queer
to
me
but
they
surely
are
different
i
can
t
imagine
them
living
anywhere
else
but
just
in
tunkett
i
love
them
all
every
one
of
them
even
old
cap
n
sam
peters
i
do
believe
used
to
say
that
cap
n
sam
was
too
lazy
to
haul
in
a
cod
even
when
he
had
him
well
hooked
then
there
s
sam
peters
and
all
the
other
fisherfolk
how
happy
little
zoeth
wixon
will
be
when
he
sees
me
i
hope
no
one
will
tell
him
that
i
m
coming
i
want
to
surprise
him
and
shags
oh
miss
gordon
won
t
shags
be
the
happiest
dog
in
all
this
world
when
he
hears
my
voice
nobody
knows
how
lonely
i
ve
been
for
my
shaggy
comrade
but
it
made
zoeth
so
happy
to
keep
him
and
i
couldn
t
have
him
here
i
must
take
everyone
of
them
a
christmas
present
what
fun
that
will
be
little
zoeth
used
to
call
me
his
because
i
told
him
the
tales
uncle
barney
had
told
to
me
oh
i
know
what
i
ll
do
i
ll
buy
him
a
book
full
of
pictures
of
fairies
and
giants
zoey
is
going
to
the
village
school
this
winter
and
if
i
choose
a
book
with
short
words
in
it
and
big
print
he
may
be
able
to
read
the
stories
all
by
himself
now
what
shall
i
get
for
linda
wixon
something
bright
and
pretty
to
wear
that
s
what
she
was
always
wishing
for
muriel
ended
breathlessly
miss
gordon
leaned
back
in
the
shadow
and
watched
the
eager
face
of
the
girl
whose
hair
was
growing
coppery
in
the
firelight
then
suddenly
muriel
s
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
her
lips
quivered
i
m
trying
not
to
think
how
lonely
i
ll
be
without
she
said
but
somehow
i
d
rather
go
home
this
first
christmas
than
anywhere
else
i
really
then
she
added
ruefully
miss
gordon
here
i
am
chattering
on
just
as
though
we
were
going
and
you
haven
t
even
said
that
you
like
the
plan
would
you
rather
go
somewhere
else
for
if
you
would
i
can
visit
faith
or
joy
for
they
have
both
invited
i
really
want
to
go
with
you
to
tunkett
muriel
was
the
earnest
reply
i
think
it
is
a
beautiful
plan
i
want
to
just
rest
and
feel
the
sweep
of
the
salt
wind
and
forget
for
a
time
that
i
have
the
responsibility
of
training
young
ladies
in
the
ways
that
they
should
then
as
was
their
wont
these
two
who
understood
each
other
sat
quietly
gazing
into
the
fire
dreaming
their
dreams
to
miss
gordon
who
for
so
many
years
had
had
no
one
to
lean
upon
it
seemed
indeed
wonderful
to
find
someone
at
last
who
wanted
to
plan
for
her
comfort
and
happiness
and
lonely
muriel
felt
that
she
would
rather
spend
this
first
christmas
since
her
had
gone
with
the
simple
folk
who
had
known
him
and
loved
him
faith
and
joy
indeed
were
disappointed
when
they
heard
that
their
beloved
muriel
was
not
to
spend
the
holidays
with
them
in
their
new
york
homes
these
girls
had
planned
to
share
their
island
friend
and
many
were
the
surprises
they
had
in
store
for
her
but
when
they
realized
how
much
it
meant
to
rilla
to
go
to
the
little
fishing
village
that
she
called
home
they
did
not
let
her
know
of
the
plans
they
had
made
for
her
pleasure
nor
need
they
be
entirely
abandoned
merely
postponed
how
i
do
wish
you
could
both
come
down
to
tunkett
for
a
while
i
am
there
muriel
exclaimed
one
day
when
joy
and
faith
had
dropped
into
her
cupola
room
for
a
moment
is
there
a
hotel
in
the
town
joy
asked
eagerly
how
rilla
laughed
nothing
like
the
one
to
which
miss
widdemere
took
us
last
week
when
we
were
in
new
york
she
said
however
there
is
an
inn
very
like
the
one
about
which
you
were
reading
faith
in
that
magazine
story
in
fact
the
fishing
village
might
almost
have
been
tunkett
i
do
believe
perhaps
all
new
england
coast
towns
are
much
that
settles
it
faith
declared
i
ve
always
wanted
to
really
see
with
my
own
eyes
a
village
like
the
one
in
that
story
haven
t
you
joy
their
dresden
china
girl
laughingly
agreed
that
the
one
desire
of
her
life
was
to
visit
just
such
a
place
and
that
if
all
went
well
they
would
surprise
muriel
by
appearing
at
the
inn
in
tunkett
for
at
least
one
of
the
vacation
which
was
but
a
fortnight
away
oh
what
jolly
fun
that
will
be
rilla
exclaimed
girls
i
believe
something
wonderful
is
going
to
happen
to
me
during
the
christmas
holidays
i
feel
it
though
i
can
t
tell
what
it
is
to
i
sincerely
hope
so
faith
said
then
after
a
hesitating
moment
she
asked
dear
have
you
ever
wished
that
you
might
know
who
your
own
father
is
muriel
s
face
grew
suddenly
pale
and
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
why
should
i
want
him
she
said
slowly
and
in
a
voice
quivering
with
emotion
since
he
did
not
care
for
me
faith
s
arms
were
about
her
dear
dear
girl
she
said
do
forgive
me
for
having
spoken
of
your
father
i
didn
t
know
i
didn
t
nor
do
i
muriel
smiled
through
her
tears
as
she
held
out
a
hand
to
her
other
dearest
friend
who
stood
silently
near
her
sweet
face
expressing
tender
sympathy
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
my
father
if
knew
about
him
he
never
told
me
he
had
promised
to
tell
me
all
about
my
s
marriage
when
i
was
eighteen
years
of
age
i
am
nearly
that
now
but
is
not
here
i
do
not
believe
that
anyone
else
knows
i
have
often
wanted
to
ask
uncle
barney
but
since
died
i
haven
t
seemed
to
care
i
have
felt
that
if
my
own
father
could
desert
his
baby
girl
surely
he
would
not
want
her
when
she
was
how
deeply
faith
regretted
that
she
had
spoken
to
muriel
of
her
unknown
father
but
it
was
done
and
could
not
be
helped
all
that
day
as
rilla
went
about
her
tasks
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
how
she
hoped
that
some
day
she
would
find
that
she
had
been
wronging
the
man
whom
her
had
loved
how
wonderful
it
would
be
she
thought
to
have
someone
who
would
be
her
very
own
to
love
her
as
her
had
loved
her
everyone
was
kind
but
no
one
could
quite
take
the
place
in
the
heart
of
muriel
of
the
three
for
whom
she
prayed
ever
since
she
was
a
who
had
died
the
who
had
sheltered
her
and
the
father
who
never
came
how
she
loved
them
all
and
how
she
longed
for
them
why
just
then
she
should
have
thought
of
her
she
could
not
have
told
but
she
did
think
of
him
and
she
resolved
that
just
as
soon
as
the
lessons
for
the
day
were
done
she
would
write
gene
beavers
that
first
letter
for
which
he
had
so
long
and
patiently
waited
gene
beavers
was
just
leaving
the
house
in
which
he
lived
with
his
parents
and
sister
on
the
outskirts
of
london
when
a
maid
recalled
him
to
give
him
the
morning
mail
she
wondered
at
the
sudden
brightening
of
his
expression
he
glanced
at
the
several
envelopes
tossed
all
but
one
back
upon
the
hall
table
unopened
slipped
that
one
into
his
pocket
and
again
went
out
he
wanted
to
read
this
very
first
letter
from
his
storm
maiden
by
the
stream
in
the
wainwater
woods
he
was
on
his
way
to
spend
the
day
with
his
boon
companion
the
viscount
wonderful
days
they
were
that
these
two
spent
together
sometimes
galloping
across
country
on
horseback
and
at
other
times
hiking
stopping
in
lovely
secluded
places
to
rest
read
and
dream
a
stranger
would
not
have
guessed
that
the
lad
had
so
recently
been
an
invalid
for
his
face
once
more
was
bronzed
by
the
wind
and
sun
and
in
his
eagerness
to
reach
his
destination
he
fairly
ran
down
the
deserted
highway
having
reached
a
sheltered
spot
he
threw
himself
down
upon
the
bank
of
the
stream
took
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
looked
admiringly
at
the
neat
and
really
pretty
handwriting
he
had
known
that
muriel
did
not
intend
to
send
him
a
letter
until
she
could
write
well
and
form
her
sentences
correctly
but
even
so
he
was
surprised
with
the
contents
of
her
missive
dear
he
read
when
i
first
came
here
i
felt
as
one
of
my
white
gulls
might
if
after
years
of
winging
through
the
sunlit
air
being
swept
hither
and
thither
and
yon
by
restless
winds
of
dipping
into
the
surf
when
it
would
it
had
suddenly
found
itself
in
a
cage
barred
in
but
now
i
am
glad
that
i
was
caught
and
kept
in
a
cage
for
i
have
learned
much
i
have
always
known
how
to
dream
but
oh
the
wonder
of
it
for
now
i
can
write
my
dreams
and
send
them
to
the
place
where
you
are
this
can
not
be
a
real
letter
but
i
did
so
want
to
tell
you
that
the
cage
door
is
to
be
open
for
two
long
weeks
and
that
i
am
going
with
our
dear
miss
gordon
whom
you
know
to
spend
the
christmas
vacation
at
tunkett
how
i
wish
that
you
were
going
to
be
there
as
you
were
last
year
do
you
remember
the
day
we
raced
with
shags
on
the
sand
and
your
sister
came
and
marianne
carnot
how
long
long
ago
that
seems
the
bell
calling
us
to
politeness
class
is
ringing
and
i
ll
have
to
say
goodbye
for
now
but
i
ll
write
you
from
tunkett
and
tell
you
how
everything
and
everyone
looks
you
quite
won
the
heart
of
brazilla
mullet
shall
you
write
to
me
while
i
am
there
your
rilla
of
the
storms
p
course
you
may
show
the
lonely
pelican
to
your
new
friend
if
you
wish
although
it
will
not
interest
a
real
poet
as
miss
gordon
tells
me
that
waine
waters
truly
is
m
leaping
to
his
feet
gene
continued
on
his
way
to
the
cabin
hidden
in
the
depths
of
the
wood
where
his
comrade
the
viscount
of
wainwater
was
impatiently
awaiting
his
coming
the
older
man
was
growing
restless
he
seldom
remained
so
long
in
england
and
he
was
preparing
to
start
on
a
journey
perhaps
to
the
nile
and
he
wanted
gene
to
be
his
traveling
companion
chapter
xxxvi
muriel
visits
tunkett
again
doctor
winslow
accompanied
miss
gordon
and
muriel
to
the
little
coast
village
of
tunkett
it
was
twilight
when
the
leisurely
train
at
last
stopped
at
the
station
and
jabez
appeared
through
the
flurry
of
snow
driving
the
doctor
s
old
horse
and
buggy
the
side
curtains
were
up
and
on
the
back
seat
the
woman
and
the
girl
were
soon
made
comfortable
how
miss
gordon
was
enjoying
every
moment
of
the
quaint
experience
of
being
suddenly
transported
from
the
atmosphere
of
a
fashionable
girls
school
and
from
the
most
modern
city
in
the
world
to
this
hamlet
which
had
changed
but
little
in
one
hundred
years
the
wagon
jolted
along
for
the
road
was
full
of
frozen
ruts
and
muriel
laughed
gleefully
as
she
was
thrown
against
the
older
woman
she
knew
that
she
was
laughing
to
keep
from
crying
but
oh
how
hard
it
was
how
much
harder
even
than
she
had
supposed
that
it
would
be
this
coming
back
to
tunkett
and
no
there
to
meet
her
but
she
would
lock
her
grief
in
her
heart
she
bravely
resolved
and
devote
the
next
two
weeks
to
bringing
rest
and
recreation
to
the
dear
friend
who
had
devoted
so
much
of
her
free
time
during
the
past
months
to
teaching
and
helping
her
as
they
turned
into
the
road
the
booming
of
the
breakers
could
plainly
be
heard
and
the
penetrating
cold
salty
wind
from
the
sea
reached
even
the
sheltered
back
seat
but
before
miss
gordon
or
muriel
could
be
chilled
they
were
turning
into
a
driveway
and
with
unexpected
suddenness
methuselah
stopped
at
a
stepping
block
near

laughed
as

and
unfastened
the
side
curtains
preparatory
to

to

he
exclaimed

laughed
does
the
old
horse
understand
what
he
means
indeed
he
does
the
physician
assured
her
then
as
the
side
door
opened
letting
out
into
the
snowy
dusk
a
welcome
flood
of
light
he
called
to
the
thin
neatly
dressed
woman
who
appeared
there
here
we
are
brazilla
bag
and
baggage
miss
gordon
this
is
the
sister
of
jabez

and
the
maker
of
the
most
famous
chowder
on
the
the
housekeeper
accepted
miss
gordon
s
hand
but
turned
at
once
to
the
tall
slender
girl
who
stood
in
the
background
smiling
at
her
just
a
bit
wistfully
rilla
rilla
storm

can
t
be
they

gone
and
made
you
over
into
a
young
lady
such
as

here
summers
to
the
the
housekeeper
actually
was
wiping
tears
from
her
eyes
with
one
corner
of
her
immaculate
apron
in
a
moment
the
girl
s
arms
were
about
her
tis
me
brazilla
maybe
my
clothes
are
different
but
my
heart
s
the
same
i
couldn
t
ever
change
doctor
winslow
had
led
miss
gordon
into
the
warm
cheerful
living
room
and
so
for
a
moment
the
two
old
friends
were
alone
in
the
entry
i
dunno
what
made
me
cry
miss
mullet
was
saying
you
can
t
guess
what
it
means
to
me
havin
you

for
christmas
rilla
i
sorter
wish
gene
beavers

too
it

that

in
the
oven
and
me
wantin
em
to
be
just
the
crispy
brown
the
way
doctor
lem
likes
for
a
moment
muriel
stood
alone
in
the
entrance
hall
thinking
of
all
that
had
happened
since
she
stood
there
before
then
she
heard
a
sweet
voice
calling
to
her
yes
miss
gordon
i
m
coming
she
replied
half
an
hour
later
all
were
seated
about
a
festive
board
and
miss
gordon
declared
that
of
such
delicious
homey
cooking
she
had
not
partaken
since
she
was
a
girl
a
kerosene
lamp
with
a
shade
hung
above
the
middle
of
the
table
and
on
the
snowy
cloth
were
the
white
dishes
with
gold
borders
that
had
belonged
in
the
long
ago
to
the
mother
of
doctor
lem
the
physician
glanced
over
a
flowering
rose
geranium
which
adorned
the
center
of
the
table
and
smiled
at
miss
gordon
who
sat
opposite
as
he
exclaimed
with
sincere
appreciation
you
are
right
helen
i
have
traveled
the
world
over
but
nowhere
have
i
found
anyone
who
can
cook
to
please
me
as
can
brazilla
that
was
what
doctor
lem
said
but
in
the
silent
moment
that
followed
his
thoughts
added
that
it
was
indeed
pleasant
to
see
the
sweet
face
of
miss
gordon
smiling
at
him
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
the
old
house
had
not
really
been
a
home
to
him
since
his
sister
and
mother
had
died
but
a
few
months
apart
the
color
in
miss
gordon
s
checks
deepened
as
she
met
his
gaze
or
perhaps
it
was
but
the
reflection
from
the
lampshade
brazilla
do
tell
me
the
news
muriel
was
saying
i
m
just
sure
that
something
interesting
must
have
happened
have
you
seen
shags
and
poor
little
crippled
zoeth
lately
and
how
are
sol
and
little
sol
one
question
at
a
time
if
you
want
them
answered
rilla
doctor
lem
smiled
at
the
girl
who
was
seated
at
his
right
i
see
little
zoey
every
day
and
shags
too
miss
brazilla
replied
and
as
for
news
i
should
say
there
was
some
hasn
t
doctor
lem
told
i
guess
he
wants
to
surprise
you
with
it
she
concluded
as
she
caught
a
glance
from
the
physician
s
smiling
grey
eyes
which
she
rightly
interpreted
you
ll
be
surprised
all
right
jabez
remarked
an
glad
too
like
the
rest
of
us
oh
uncle
lem
when
am
i
to
know
the
girl
turned
eager
glowing
eyes
toward
the
physician
and
searched
his
face
but
his
expression
was
inscrutable
what
has
happened
i
do
believe
that
it
is
something
about
the
brazilla
rose
just
then
to
replenish
the
biscuits
and
when
she
returned
she
exclaimed
beamingly
jabe
and
i
have
another
surprise
for
you
rilla
and
this
one
even
doctor
lem
don
know
he
ll
be
jest
as
s
prised
an
pleased
as
you
ll
oh
goodie
ejaculated
muriel
in
little
girl
fashion
then
there
are
two
surprises
awaiting
me
when
am
i
to
find
them
out
tomorrow
if
the
weather
s
fine
or
even
if
tisn
t
i
don
t
suppose
that
foul
weather
could
keep
you
anchored
in
port
when
ye
ve
friends
expectin
you
over
on
the
sand
this
from
jabez
i
should
say
not
the
girl
retorted
the
wildest
tempest
that
ever
raged
over
this
coast
couldn
t
keep
me
from
going
to
see
zoey
and
shags
the
first
thing
tomorrow
morning
there
s
one
thing
though
i
m
sort
of
dreading
and
that
s
seeing
dear
old
uncle
barney
s
cabin
boarded
up
and
looking
so
then
turning
to
captain
mullet
she
continued
jabez
some
day
soon
will
you
sail
miss
gordon
and
me
over
to
windy
island
i
want
to
find
my
lame
pelican
if
he
is
there
and
feed
the
yeah
rilla
i
ll
cruise
ye
over
thar
mos
any
time
the
wind
s
don
t
take
any
chances
doctor
winslow
warned
he
suddenly
realized
that
the
two
who
would
be
passengers
were
very
precious
to
him
and
he
did
not
want
to
lose
them
then
he
rebuked
himself
it
was
presumptuous
for
a
man
nearing
sixty
to
think
that
as
wonderful
a
woman
as
miss
gordon
could
care
for
him
he
would
put
the
thought
from
him
and
think
of
her
only
as
a
dear
friend
doctor
lem
returned
to
the
city
that
night
but
promised
to
run
down
again
in
a
few
days
and
if
possible
remain
over
christmas
miss
gordon
and
muriel
retired
early
to
the
big
upper
chamber
where
a
glowing
bed
of
embers
on
the
hearth
was
sending
forth
its
warmth
but
it
was
long
before
either
of
them
slept
for
each
was
dreaming
dreams
as
they
listened
to
the
intermittent
wail
of
the
foghorn
to
the
distant
boom
of
the
surf
on
the
rocks
and
to
the
rush
and
swish
of
the
snow
beating
against
the
windows
chapter
xxxvii
muriel
surprised
muriel
had
intended
to
arise
very
early
the
next
morning
but
so
late
had
she
fallen
asleep
though
she
had
retired
early
enough
that
it
was
not
until
brazilla
came
to
make
a
fire
on
the
hearth
that
the
girl
awakened
miss
gordon
too
opened
her
eyes
and
muriel
sitting
up
in
bed
exclaimed
joyfully
oh
what
a
wonderful
day
all
is
white
and
sparkling
the
sky
is
so
blue
and
the
sunshine
so
bright
brazilla
would
right
after
breakfast
be
too
soon
to
start
out
to
find
those
two
surprises
you
ll
have
to
wear
my
leggins
i
m
thinkin
brazilla
declared
the
snow
ll
be
above
your
easy
and
more
than
that
at
the
an
hour
later
muriel
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
large
living
room
and
miss
gordon
glanced
up
at
her
from
the
book
she
was
reading
why
muriel
you
look
stouter
than
usual
was
her
puzzled
comment
no
wonder
rilla
laughingly
confessed
i
do
believe
that
brazilla
has
put
on
me
two
layers
of
everything
that
she
could
find
including
the
leggins
and
her
warm
red
hood
jack
frost
will
have
a
hard
time
finding
a
place
to
nip
goodbye
miss
gordon
i
ll
be
back
by
noon
i
know
that
you
are
going
to
have
a
wonderful
two
hours
just
resting
and
then
she
was
gone
i
never
knew
that
one
could
have
so
many
different
kinds
of
emotions
at
the
same
time
muriel
was
thinking
as
she
started
down
the
snowy
road
that
led
to
the
sand
dunes
where
stood
the
scattered
homes
of
her
fisherfolk
friends
a
queer
looking
settlement
it
was
for
each
squatter
had
built
his
cabin
facing
in
whatever
direction
his
particular
fancy
had
suggested
a
few
had
preferred
to
face
the
town
and
others
had
their
front
dooryards
on
the
side
toward
the
sea
but
as
there
were
from
one
hundred
to
two
hundred
feet
of
sand
dune
between
each
shack
no
one
interfered
with
his
neighbor
muriel
purposely
went
a
roundabout
way
to
avoid
passing
the
cabin
of
her
uncle
barney
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
as
she
thought
of
him
how
she
longed
to
see
that
dear
faithful
old
man
who
had
been
her
s
closest
friend
and
comrade
through
many
years
but
she
would
have
to
wait
until
spring
even
then
she
doubted
if
he
would
be
able
to
bring
his
old
mother
who
was
very
feeble
she
did
not
even
glance
in
that
direction
when
she
reached
the
sand
dunes
but
went
at
once
to
the
cabin
of
the
wixons
she
whistled
the
old
familiar
call
a
short
joyous
bark
was
heard
in
reply
the
cabin
door
opened
and
out
leaped
a
dog
grown
larger
perhaps
her
own
beloved
shags
if
there
had
been
in
her
heart
a
fear
that
he
might
have
forgotten
her
it
was
soon
dispelled
the
joy
expressed
in
every
move
that
he
made
told
as
plainly
as
words
could
have
done
that
here
was
the
one
person
in
all
the
world
whom
he
loved
best
down
on
the
snow
the
girl
knelt
her
arms
were
about
her
shaggy
friend
her
face
for
a
moment
hidden
in
the
long
silky
hair
at
his
neck
oh
how
hard
it
was
not
to
sob
shagsie
my
shagsie
the
girl
cried
but
just
at
that
moment
the
joyous
voice
of
a
boy
was
heard
looking
up
rilla
saw
a
little
lad
emerging
from
the
cabin
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
stared
in
uncomprehending
amazement
surely
it
was
zoeth
but
where
were
his
crutches
he
was
running
toward
her
down
the
recently
shoveled
path
his
arms
held
out
to
her
zoey
muriel
exclaimed
catching
the
little
fellow
and
holding
him
close
you
re
not
crippled
any
more
darling
laddie
what
has
happened
the
small
boy
clapped
his
hands
and
hopped
up
and
down
i
wanted
to
s
prise
you
i
tol
doctor
lem
not
to
tell
you
he
did
it
rilla
he
mended
me
an
he
s
been
months
doin
it
he
s
goin
to
send
me
to
a
boys
school
next
year
rilla
doctor
lem
says
he
s
going
to
make
me
into
a
how
the
lad
s
eyes
were
glowing
you
know
how
uncle
barney
used
to
teach
me
to
make
little
ships
and
how
i
d
love
to
draw
pictures
of
em
well
doctor
lem
looked
em
over
once
and
that
s
how
he
got
the
notion
of
sendin
me
away
to
a
school
whar
i
could
learn
how
to
do
it
in
the
midst
of
this
joyous
chatter
the
small
boy
stopped
as
though
he
had
suddenly
thought
of
something
rilly
he
said
his
face
eagerly
questioning
you
didn
t
come
along
by
the
sand
dunes
did
you
muriel
gazed
down
at
the
snow
or
out
at
the
ocean
anywhere
but
ahead
where
she
knew
she
would
have
to
see
the
cottage
toward
which
zoeth
was
fairly
dragging
her
shags
bounded
along
at
her
side
barking
joyfully
at
last
the
child
could
keep
quiet
no
longer
why
don
t
you
look
rilly
he
queried
eagerly
why
don
t
you
look
he
had
stopped
directly
in
front
of
the
cabin
which
had
been
so
much
in
her
thoughts
and
so
muriel
was
obliged
to
lift
her
eyes
why
what
could
it
mean
the
windows
were
not
boarded
up
as
she
had
expected
to
find
them
there
was
smoke
coming
out
of
the
chimney
and
a
geranium
was
blossoming
on
the
window
sill
for
a
moment
the
girl
felt
rebellious
was
some
one
else
living
in
uncle
barney
s
house
she
was
sure
that
he
would
not
wish
it
to
be
occupied
until
he
came
and
yet
on
second
thought
she
knew
that
it
could
be
inhabited
only
with
his
consent
then
she
looked
down
at
her
companion
s
glowing
face
all
at
once
she
read
the
meaning
of
the
happy
light
that
she
saw
in
his
eyes
zoey
she
cried
uncle
barney
has
come
back
at
the
sound
of
his
name
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
the
bronzed
old
sea
captain
sprang
out
and
caught
the
amazed
girl
in
his
arms
oh
i
ll
just
have
to
cry
now
rilla
sobbed
as
she
clung
to
him
i
ve
tried
so
hard

tried
to
be
brave
when
i
saw
shags
and

ol
uncle
barney
s
he
led
the
girl
into
the
cabin
and
called
to
someone
who
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
corner
muriel
decided
at
once
that
it
would
not
be
hard
to
love
the
irish
woman
who
though
elderly
was
as
blooming
as
a
late
rose
with
her
ruddy
cheeks
and
twinkling
blue
eyes
that
held
in
their
merry
depths
eternal
youth
molly
s
the
wife
i
ve
been
waitin
for
ever
since
she
was
a
gal
uncle
barney
said
as
he
laid
an
arm
lovingly
on
the
shoulders
over
which
a
gay
red
and
yellow
plaid
shawl
was
folded
then
he
told
how
they
had
been
sweethearts
when
they
were
lad
and
lassie
in
the
long
long
ago
but
that
his
molly
had
married
another
and
that
was
why
barney
had
come
to
america
to
live
but
he
had
always
been
faithful
to
his
first
love
and
at
last
they
were
to
be
together
through
the
sunset
of
life
this
little
ol
cabin
s
a
real
home
now
rilly
gal
the
old
man
said
an
it
s
yer
home
too
colleen
if
ever
yer
needin
an
hour
later
when
muriel
stood
in
doctor
lem
s
kitchen
warming
her
fingers
over
the
fire
in
the
great
stove
she
said
brazilla
i
hardly
know
which
of
your
two
surprises
was
the
most
wonderful
to
think
that
dear
brave
little
zoey
is
to
have
his
chance
and
all
because
of
that
kind
man
doctor
winslow
i
am
sure
that
zoeth
wixon
will
make
us
all
proud
of
him
but
weren
t
you
surprised
when
uncle
barney
came
home
with
a
wife
i
reckon
i
was
nothin
could
surprise
me
more
less
twould
be
doctor
lem
s
comin
home
with
a
wife
but
that
s
not
likely
to
happen
though
i
sure
sartin
wish
it
just
at
that
moment
muriel
thought
of
something
she
had
noticed
the
night
before
that
doctor
winslow
often
had
looked
over
the
rose
geranium
at
lovely
miss
gordon
and
surely
in
his
eyes
there
had
her
thoughts
were
interrupted
with
rilly
sposin
yo
take
in
the
platter
o
fried
fish
an
tell
miss
gordon
as
everything
s
dished
up
an
chapter
xxxviii
muriel
visits
windy
island
uncle
barney
had
done
a
good
deal
of
thinking
since
he
had
returned
to
his
cabin
in
the
sand
dunes
he
was
recalling
a
visit
he
had
received
from
captain
ezra
bassett
a
short
time
before
he
set
sail
for
ireland
it
was
then
that
muriel
s
had
told
him
all
that
he
knew
of
the
girl
s
own
father
and
at
the
end
of
the
story
he
had
said
if
anything
happens
to
me
barney
like
as
not
rilla
s
own
dad
would
be
the
right
one
for
her
to
go
to
you
can
allays
reach
him
by
writin
to
the
address
that
s
in
the
little
iron
box
whar
the
tools
r
kept
for
fixin
the
how
well
barney
remembered
that
little
iron
box
it
had
been
on
many
a
sea
voyage
when
ezra
had
been
in
command
of
the
schooner
the
stormy
petrel
and
the
faithful
irishman
had
been
first
mate
then
when
the
older
man
had
settled
on
windy
island
barney
had
often
seen
the
box
in
the
small
closet
at
the
top
of
the
tower
where
the
oil
can
tools
and
cleaning
rags
were
kept
what
ought
he
to
do
about
it
he
ruminated
as
he
sat
near
his
glowing
stove
on
the
day
following
muriel
s
visit
and
smoked
pipe
after
pipe
in
thoughtful
silence
ought
he
to
tell
the
girl
and
yet
now
that
the
tower
was
but
a
fallen
heap
of
stones
would
it
be
possible
for
them
to
find
the
little
iron
box
it
s
colleen
herself
as
shall
do
the
decidin
he
at
last
determined
rising
he
put
on
his
heavy
coat
cap
and
the
scarlet
muffler
that
molly
had
knitted
for
him
and
telling
his
good
wife
that
he
might
not
be
back
until
late
he
started
walking
toward
the
home
of
doctor
winslow
muriel
was
out
on
the
veranda
sweeping
away
the
light
snow
that
had
fallen
in
the
night
top
o
the
morning
to
you
uncle
barney
she
called
as
she
waved
the
broom
have
you
come
to
invite
me
to
take
a
cruise
with
you
the
old
man
smiled
up
at
her
as
he
ascended
the
steps
and
yet
so
well
did
the
girl
know
him
that
she
at
once
sensed
that
something
was
troubling
him
however
it
was
in
his
usual
cheerful
manner
that
he
replied
it
s
a
mind
reader
that
you
are
rilly
gal
for
twas
that
very
thing
i
was
after
thinkin
i
cal
lated
i
d
cruise
over
to
windy
island
this
mornin
and
i
was
hopin
as
how
you
d
like
to
go
along
as
there
were
sudden
tears
in
the
hazel
eyes
of
the
girl
as
she
held
the
old
man
s
warmly
mittened
hand
in
a
firm
clasp
uncle
barney
she
said
with
a
suspicion
of
a
sob
in
her
voice
i
d
rather
be
goin
there
for
the
first
time
with
you
than
with
anyone
else
in
all
the
world
perhaps
because
my
loved
you
just
as
he
would
had
you
been
his
i
know
i
know
the
irishman
assured
her
then
to
hide
his
own
emotion
he
hurried
on
to
say
bundle
up
warm
rilly
gal
for
though
tis
sunny
the
air
is
powerful
nippin
i
reckon
you
d
better
be
tellin
your
folks
as
how
you
may
be
late
comin
back
to
sort
o
get
em
out
of
the
notion
o
worryin
tell
em
yer
ol
uncle
barney
ll
land
you
in
the
home
port
safe
an
sound
along
about
although
muriel
was
surprised
to
hear
that
they
might
remain
so
long
on
windy
island
she
made
no
comment
but
skipped
into
the
house
to
put
on
her
wraps
and
tell
miss
gordon
of
the
planned
voyage
uncle
barney
had
not
said
that
he
wished
only
muriel
to
accompany
him
but
the
girl
was
sure
that
the
captain
had
something
that
he
wished
to
say
to
her
alone
perhaps
her
had
asked
him
to
sometime
tell
her
about
the
marriage
of
her
how
she
hoped
this
might
be
so
but
of
her
thoughts
muriel
said
nothing
as
they
tramped
together
out
on
the
wharf
near
which
the
captain
s
dory
was
anchored
it
was
not
until
they
were
sailing
in
the
smoother
waters
on
the
sheltered
side
of
the
island
that
ezra
bassett
s
old
friend
told
the
girl
he
had
so
loved
why
he
had
brought
her
that
day
to
visit
the
ruined
lighthouse
uncle
barney
the
girl
looked
across
at
him
hopefully
eagerly
won
t
you
be
telling
me
all
that
you
know
about
my
and
my
well
colleen
dearie
thar
ain
t
much
to
tell
your
pa
it
peared
like
to
us
as
saw
him
was
a
poor
artist
fellow
as
came
one
summer
to
this
here
coast
to
make
pictures
yer
ma
darlin
was
jest
like
yo
are
now
the
two
of
yo
couldn
t
be
told
apart
that
artist
fellow
met
up
wi
her
in
the
store
sol
tol
me
an
nothin
would
do
arter
that
but
he
must
make
a
paintin
of
that
other
rilla
up
on
the
rocks
he
was
mighty
takin
in
his
ways
i
ll
say
that
for
him
an
upstandin
too
i
d
from
the
little
i
saw
of
him
that
he
d
be
a
square
dealer
but
like
be
i
was
wrong
for
when
your
got
wind
of
him
courtin
his
gal
fer
that
s
what
it
had
come
to
by
the
end
of
the
summer
ol
ezra
tol
him
to
clear
out
yo
re
ma
pleaded
but
yo
know
that
look
yer
used
to
get
when
he
was
sot
an
sot
hard
that
s
the
way
he
looked
then
wall
the
next
day
that
artist
fellow
was
gone
but
so
too
was
the
gal
ol
ezra
bassett
had
set
sech
a
store
the
kindly
irishman
dreaded
telling
the
rest
of
the
story
as
it
reflected
no
credit
to
the
honor
of
the
and
he
was
glad
indeed
to
find
that
the
dock
had
been
reached
nor
did
the
girl
question
him
even
captain
barney
did
not
know
how
hard
it
was
for
muriel
to
climb
the
flight
of
steps
that
led
to
the
only
home
her
girlhood
had
ever
known
and
then
when
the
top
was
reached
to
see
that
home
lying
one
rock
heaped
upon
another
the
whole
jagged
mass
covered
with
a
sparkling
white
blanket
the
little
iron
box
that
you
were
telling
me
about
uncle
barney
rilla
began
as
she
smiled
bravely
up
at
her
companion
since
it
was
kept
near
the
lamp
don
t
you
think
that
in
falling
they
would
lie
near
each
other
the
old
man
nodded
i
reckon
so
he
replied
an
yet
thar
s
no
tellin
a
reg
lar
tornado
twas
along
the
coast
that
day
and
what
with
the
lightnin
hitting
the
tower
and
the
wind
twistin
it
things
that
fell
might
o
got
purty
much
scattered
about
seems
going
to
the
old
shed
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
the
captain
procured
shovels
and
a
broom
and
together
they
began
to
remove
the
snow
from
the
rocks
that
were
nearest
it
s
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
the
girl
declared
when
they
had
worked
for
an
hour
and
had
not
discovered
the
great
lamp
which
for
so
many
years
had
swung
its
circling
light
over
the
darkened
sea
seems
powerful
quare
to
me
whar
that
big
lantern
can
be
the
old
man
said
at
last
as
he
leaned
on
the
handle
of
his
shovel
to
rest
pears
like
it
ought
ve
fallen
on
top
o
the
heap
bein
as
it
was
the
highest
up
but
tisn
t
here
sure
muriel
standing
on
the
uncovered
rocks
looked
down
at
him
uncle
barney
she
said
do
you
suppose
that
someone
has
carried
the
lamp
away
to
sell
for
old
iron
the
captain
shook
his
head
no
rilly
gal
i
reckon
not
it
s
government
property
and
no
one
d
be
likely
to
cart
it
at
noon
they
went
down
to
the
little
beach
shed
the
irishman
made
a
fire
in
the
rusty
old
stove
and
they
sat
near
appreciating
its
warmth
while
they
ate
the
good
lunch
that
molly
had
prepared
oh
uncle
barney
the
girl
exclaimed
half
an
hour
later
it
s
me
as
is
goin
to
take
the
crumbs
and
bits
to
the
top
of
the
cliff
and
see
if
i
can
coax
the
seagulls
from
the
caves
that
is
if
they
are
it
was
well
that
brazilla
mullet
had
insisted
that
the
girl
wear
her
thick
woolen
leggins
for
she
had
to
wade
through
deep
unbroken
drifts
of
snow
to
reach
the
spot
where
so
often
she
had
stood
to
feed
her
bird
friends
but
though
she
called
and
called
the
gulls
that
in
former
winters
had
appeared
from
the
warm
caves
in
the
rocks
did
not
respond
not
even
the
lone
pelican
which
she
had
hoped
would
come
almost
sadly
the
girl
was
turning
away
when
she
chanced
to
look
over
the
steep
cliff
and
there
half
way
down
firmly
wedged
between
an
outjutting
ledge
and
a
small
twisted
pine
she
saw
something
that
sent
her
leaping
back
toward
the
fallen
tower
uncle
barney
she
called
excitedly
come
quick
i
ve
found
it
i
ve
found
the
lamp
the
old
irishman
was
soon
at
her
side
rilla
looked
up
with
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
said
poor
thing
how
forlorn
it
looks
with
the
glass
broken
and
the
sides
crushed
the
old
man
held
fast
to
the
girl
for
she
was
perilously
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
i
reckon
we
d
better
not
try
to
go
down
to
it
he
said
after
a
moment
of
silent
observation
thar
s
nothin
to
hold
on
to
till
ye
get
to
that
ledge
an
it
s
plain
to
see
that
the
box
isn
t
alongside
o
the
lamp
it
bears
out
my
notion
that
things
was
hurled
hither
and
yon
when
the
tower
fell
so
thar
s
no
tellin
whar
the
little
box
then
drawing
the
girl
back
to
a
place
of
greater
safety
he
continued
as
he
glanced
at
the
sky
it
s
gettin
toward
midafternoon
colleen
an
those
blizzardy
lookin
clouds
over
on
the
horizon
ar
spreadin
fast
i
reckon
as
how
we
d
better
put
off
huntin
for
the
box
till
arter
thar
s
been
a
thaw
then
likie
s
not
we
ll
find
it
easy
when
the
snow
s
all
right
uncle
barney
the
girl
replied
we
will
do
just
as
you
think
best
but
how
i
do
wish
that
just
for
a
moment
i
might
visit
my
dear
old
treasure
cave
don
t
you
suppose
that
if
we
went
along
the
beach
i
might
be
able
to
climb
up
to
it
i
ve
been
there
many
a
time
in
winter
and
i
know
just
where
my
steps
are
even
under
the
the
girl
s
eyes
were
so
glowingly
eager
that
the
old
man
could
not
refuse
wall
wall
rilly
gal
he
said
i
reckon
we
d
have
time
to
poke
around
a
while
longer
if
twould
be
pleasin
to
you
the
storm
s
likely
to
hold
off
till
nigh
oh
thank
you
uncle
muriel
caught
the
old
man
s
mittened
hand
and
led
him
along
at
a
merry
pace
breaking
a
path
in
the
snow
just
ahead
of
him
at
last
they
reached
the
very
spot
where
many
months
before
muriel
had
stood
when
she
had
beheld
a
city
lad
for
the
first
time
d
ye
ever
hear
from
gene
beavers
nowadays
the
captain
asked
when
rilla
recalled
to
him
the
incident
of
which
she
had
been
thinking
indeed
i
do
and
oh
uncle
barney
such
wonderful
times
as
gene
is
having
he
has
a
new
friend
in
england
whom
he
calls
viscount
of
the
old
man
gazed
at
his
companion
in
uncomprehending
amazement
the
viscount
of
wainwater
is
it
rilly
can
i
be
hearin
right
why
gal
he
s
as
big
a
man
as
thar
is
in
all
england
barrin
the
king
himself
he
s
what
folks
call
a
philanthropist
though
thar
s
them
as
calls
him
an
irish
sympathizer
but
tisn
t
the
irish
only
that
he
s
benefactin
but
all
as
are
why
rilly
he
twas
that
bought
a
whole
township
over
in
connaught
and
tore
down
the
mud
huts
and
had
decent
little
cabins
built
for
the
old
folks
to
be
livin
in
many
s
the
time
he
s
ridden
by
on
that
han
some
brown
horse
of
his
an
stopped
at
me
mither
s
door
for
a
bit
of
refreshment
an
it
was
me
ol
mither
that
couldn
t
talk
of
anything
for
days
but
of
how
foine
a
gintleman
was
the
viscount
of
wainwater
it
s
curious
now
ain
t
it
that
gene
beavers
is
arter
knowin
him
it
sartin
is
an
honor
to
be
a
friend
of
the
as
the
captain
talked
muriel
surefooted
on
the
rocky
paths
that
she
had
followed
since
childhood
led
him
down
to
the
beach
where
the
sand
had
been
swept
clear
of
snow
by
the
prevailing
winds
they
walked
around
the
island
and
stood
just
beneath
the
cave
to
which
muriel
had
carried
every
little
treasure
that
had
been
given
her
by
her
few
friends
or
that
had
been
tossed
high
on
the
beach
by
the
sea
the
trail
looked
very
steep
and
slippery
to
the
old
man
rilla
gal
he
said
i
reckon
i
ll
stay
here
a
bit
and
he
waitin
for
ye
while
ye
do
yer
explorin
the
girl
her
cheeks
rosy
her
eyes
glowing
laughed
back
at
him
over
her
shoulder
for
she
was
already
half
way
up
the
trail
when
muriel
reached
the
shelving
rock
in
front
of
her
cave
she
turned
and
waved
to
the
old
man
who
stood
watching
far
below
then
stooping
she
disappeared
to
her
amazement
she
found
that
the
place
was
flooded
with
light
the
reason
she
quickly
discerned
great
rocks
hurled
from
the
falling
tower
had
crashed
through
the
roof
of
the
cave
and
were
piled
high
on
its
floor
eagerly
the
girl
began
to
search
among
them
for
the
box
when
fifteen
minutes
had
passed
and
she
did
not
reappear
the
old
captain
became
anxious
and
climbed
to
the
opening
wall
i
ll
be
he
exclaimed
if
here
ain
t
the
door
to
the
closet
whar
the
tools
for
the
big
lamp
was
muriel
with
a
delighted
cry
sprang
toward
him
but
stumbled
over
some
small
hard
object
which
had
been
almost
imbedded
in
crumbled
sandstone
it
was
the
little
iron
box
but
it
was
locked
the
old
man
was
as
excited
as
the
girl
he
took
the
small
box
which
muriel
lifted
toward
him
and
examined
it
the
lock
don
t
matter
he
replied
thar
s
tools
in
the
cabin
that
ll
open
it
soon
enough
come
now
twon
t
do
to
be
delayin
any
longer
can
t
ye
hear
the
threatenin
sound
the
wind
is
makin
it
s
moanin
into
the
cave
here
like
a
graveyard
full
of
ghosts
let
when
they
were
again
on
the
beach
the
girl
saw
that
the
captain
was
indeed
a
weather
prophet
for
the
clouds
were
being
hurled
toward
them
by
a
wind
that
was
momentarily
increasing
in
velocity
luckily
it
came
from
over
the
sea
and
the
water
between
the
island
and
tunkett
would
still
be
sheltered
they
were
soon
in
the
dory
scudding
toward
the
home
port
but
barely
had
they
landed
when
the
snow
began
to
fall
so
thick
and
fast
that
they
could
scarcely
see
each
other
the
wind
from
the
sea
fairly
blew
them
up
the
street
toward
the
home
of
doctor
winslow
for
a
moment
the
old
irishman
drew
the
girl
under
the
shelter
of
an
evergreen
tree
while
he
said
hurriedly
rilla
gal
i
reckon
twould
be
best
if
i
sent
the
letter
bein
as
that
was
yer
s
wish
an
like
s
not
ye
d
better
not
be
mentionin
it
to
anyone
yet
fer
a
spell
not
knowin
the
old
man
paused
he
did
not
want
to
hurt
the
girl
s
feelings
by
saying
that
after
all
these
years
her
own
father
might
not
care
to
claim
his
daughter
you
are
right
uncle
barney
was
the
reply
i
ll
not
say
a
word
but
oh
how
i
do
do
hope
that
my
own
father
will
love
that
evening
the
little
iron
box
was
opened
the
address
found
and
molly
who
at
one
time
had
been
a
school
mistress
in
connaught
penned
the
letter
that
was
sent
speeding
to
its
destination
on
the
midnight
train
chapter
xxxix
a
letter
from
gene
when
muriel
entered
the
house
she
found
awaiting
her
a
letter
from
gene
and
strange
indeed
was
the
postmark
for
with
his
good
friend
the
viscount
of
wainwater
the
lad
was
traveling
in
foreign
lands
there
were
several
sheets
of
thin
paper
and
these
were
covered
with
such
fine
handwriting
that
it
took
the
girl
much
longer
than
usual
to
decipher
them
she
retired
to
the
doctor
s
den
directly
after
the
evening
meal
and
having
made
a
fire
on
the
hearth
she
curled
up
in
a
big
comfortable
chair
near
the
reading
table
for
she
felt
that
she
wanted
to
be
alone
while
she
had
this
visit
with
the
lad
who
called
himself
her
the
first
part
of
the
epistle
was
devoted
to
descriptions
of
their
travels
and
adventures
then
came
some
personal
news
items
the
most
astonishing
of
these
being
that
monsieur
carnot
had
received
a
cablegram
informing
him
that
marianne
was
leaving
high
cliffs
seminary
at
once
and
would
return
to
france
to
complete
her
education
her
reason
for
this
unexpected
action
was
not
given
another
page
was
devoted
to
the
viscount
gene
had
written
how
i
do
hope
that
some
day
you
may
meet
this
wonderful
man
whose
conversation
is
to
me
more
delightful
than
any
book
i
have
ever
read
whose
considerate
thoughtfulness
of
all
whom
we
meet
especially
those
who
are
poor
or
in
trouble
makes
him
more
a
nobleman
than
does
his
title
i
have
saved
until
the
close
of
this
long
rambling
letter
a
bit
of
news
that
will
rejoice
your
heart
even
as
it
did
mine
you
will
recall
that
you
told
me
that
i
might
show
your
poem
the
lonely
pelican
to
my
wayne
but
that
you
would
rather
that
i
did
not
tell
him
about
yourself
although
why
you
made
the
request
i
am
sure
i
can
not
guess
muriel
i
don
t
want
you
ever
to
be
ashamed
of
who
you
are
for
though
your
parents
were
simple
fisherfolk
you
are
a
princess
among
girls
i
am
as
proud
to
know
you
as
i
am
to
know
the
viscount
of
wainwater
this
was
his
comment
when
he
finished
reading
your
little
poem
gene
i
would
be
glad
had
i
written
that
it
is
a
lovely
muriel
some
day
may
i
tell
him
about
you
how
your
little
girlhood
was
spent
cradled
out
there
on
windy
island
among
the
wild
sea
waves
companioned
by
that
splendid
old
man
who
was
one
of
nature
s
truest
noblemen
and
with
only
birds
and
shags
for
playmates
he
will
better
understand
your
poem
address
your
next
letter
to
cairo
care
of
the
american
for
a
long
time
muriel
sat
curled
up
in
that
deep
cushioned
chair
gazing
into
the
fire
and
dreaming
dreams
how
strange
how
unreal
that
she
the
daughter
of
a
long
line
of
seafaring
people
should
be
the
friend
of
a
lad
who
was
the
chosen
comrade
of
a
viscount
and
yet
gene
had
spoken
truly
no
man
could
be
more
noble
than
her
own
grandfather
then
came
a
tap
on
the
closed
door
and
the
pleasant
voice
of
miss
gordon
nine
o
clock
dear
you
know
our
retire
at
that
instantly
muriel
was
on
her
feet
rebuking
herself
for
having
left
miss
gordon
alone
opening
the
door
she
said
won
t
you
come
in
it
won
t
matter
will
it
if
we
stay
up
a
little
later
this
evening
i
would
like
you
to
read
this
wonderful
letter
from
gene
and
so
it
was
that
miss
gordon
was
ensconced
in
the
big
comfortable
chair
and
with
muriel
on
a
stool
at
her
feet
the
older
woman
read
the
letter
aloud
what
a
privilege
it
is
for
your
friend
gene
to
have
the
companionship
of
that
prince
among
men
i
have
often
greatly
admired
the
verses
of
wayne
waters
and
the
older
woman
paused
and
looked
thoughtfully
into
the
fire
as
she
had
hesitated
muriel
glanced
up
questioningly
i
had
thought
that
i
would
not
tell
you
miss
gordon
continued
but
now
i
believe
that
i
will
before
we
left
high
cliffs
miss
humphrey
found
a
poem
in
a
new
magazine
the
title
of
which
was
the
moor
in
oh
miss
gordon
then
you
have
found
out
about
marianne
you
knew
all
the
time
muriel
and
did
not
tell
me
the
girl
bowed
her
head
yes
gene
had
written
telling
me
about
that
suddenly
looking
up
she
inquired
is
that
why
marianne
is
leaving
high
cliffs
yes
was
the
reply
miss
humphrey
is
acting
principal
during
my
absence
and
she
has
expelled
the
young
chapter
xl
joy
and
faith
visit
tunkett
the
blinding
snowstorm
which
had
started
the
night
before
as
muriel
and
captain
barney
had
returned
from
windy
island
increased
in
fury
during
the
night
and
even
muriel
did
not
care
to
battle
through
the
elements
the
next
day
to
visit
the
cabins
on
the
dunes
she
indeed
was
curious
to
see
the
address
to
which
the
letter
was
to
be
sent
and
she
looked
eagerly
out
at
the
storm
wondering
how
long
it
would
last
miss
gordon
was
so
interested
in
her
book
that
she
did
not
notice
muriel
s
suppressed
excitement
the
girl
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
letter
and
its
possible
reception
by
the
storm
who
of
course
was
her
father
what
if
this
unknown
father
might
prove
to
be
someone
for
whom
she
could
not
care
but
she
put
that
thought
away
from
her
of
course
she
would
dearly
love
the
man
whom
her
had
loved
and
trusted
then
she
wondered
how
far
the
letter
would
have
to
travel
to
reach
him
and
how
long
a
time
would
elapse
before
she
would
have
a
reply
would
that
reply
bid
her
go
to
another
part
of
america
to
live
it
was
midmorning
when
the
girl
s
revery
was
interrupted
by
the
ringing
of
the
telephone
skipping
to
the
doctor
s
study
she
lifted
the
receiver
and
upon
hearing
the
voice
at
the
other
end
her
face
brightened
oh
uncle
lem
i
m
so
glad
you
were
able
to
get
away
yes
i
ll
send
jabez
right
down
to
the
station
you
want
brazilla
to
make
a
double
quantity
of
clam
chowder
why
uncle
lem
how
hungry
you
must
be
all
right
i
ll
tell
her
oh
isn
t
that
the
jolliest
muriel
beamed
at
miss
gordon
whose
book
had
been
dropped
to
her
lap
when
she
learned
that
doctor
winslow
was
in
town
into
the
kitchen
the
girl
skipped
when
jabez
had
been
notified
what
can
i
do
to
help
rilla
asked
and
brazilla
replied
well
maybe
you
d
better
fetch
out
the
best
cloth
and
set
the
table
extra
fine
i
reckon
another
log
on
the
hearth
would
make
the
dinin
more
cheerful
like
then
thar
s
a
geranium
on
the
south
window
sill
that
blossomed
this
morning
you
might
put
that
in
the
put
it
in
the
middle
of
the
fire
the
girl
asked
merrily
then
she
whirled
about
and
kissed
the
astonished
housekeeper
on
the
forehead
oh
brazilla
she
exclaimed
please
don
t
mind
my
nonsense
i
m
so
excited
about
something
that
i
can
t
tell
yet
that
i
don
t
know
what
i
am
wall
i
should
say
rilly
that
suthin
onusual
must
to
yer
head
you
don
t
act
at
all
natural
an
yer
cheeks
are
so
then
anxiously
the
good
woman
added
you
don
t
feel
feverish
do
you
no
brazilla
honest
injun
i
m
all
right
now
i
ll
get
the
table
was
all
set
and
most
attractive
it
looked
when
the
joyous
ringing
of
sleighbells
was
heard
in
the
drive
muriel
waited
until
she
heard
a
stamping
of
feet
on
the
front
porch
then
she
threw
open
the
door
and
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
for
with
the
good
doctor
were
her
two
best
friends
oh
joy
faith
what
a
wonderful
surprise
in
spite
of
their
snowy
garments
she
hugged
them
both
then
whirling
and
shaking
a
finger
at
the
doctor
she
accused
now
i
know
why
you
pretended
to
be
so
ravenously
hungry
and
ordered
a
double
portion
of
clam
guilty
the
doctor
kissed
his
ward
then
leaving
the
girls
with
their
hostess
he
went
into
the
in
search
of
miss
gordon
he
found
her
standing
by
the
fireplace
helen
he
said
impulsively
as
he
advanced
toward
her
you
can
t
know
what
it
means
to
me
to
find
you
waiting
to
welcome
me
by
my
own
which
for
so
many
years
has
been
deserted
and
lonely
so
lonely
helen
since
mother
just
why
there
were
tears
in
the
sweet
grey
eyes
that
were
lifted
to
him
miss
gordon
could
not
have
told
for
the
realization
had
come
to
them
both
that
this
was
truly
a
moment
for
rejoicing
but
all
that
the
little
woman
said
was
i
ve
been
lonely
too
just
at
that
moment
into
the
room
danced
muriel
leading
the
two
laughing
girls
whose
heavy
wraps
had
been
removed
the
older
woman
turned
to
greet
them
and
the
physician
went
to
his
own
room
to
prepare
for
his
evening
meal
isn
t
this
just
like
a
party
rilla
exclaimed
half
an
hour
later
when
they
were
seated
about
the
long
table
oh
girls
i
had
been
hoping
that
you
would
come
for
a
as
you
had
promised
but
how
did
you
happen
to
be
with
uncle
lem
we
met
doctor
winslow
in
the
station
at
new
york
and
when
we
told
him
that
we
were
coming
to
stay
at
the
inn
in
tunkett
for
a
few
days
he
declared
that
we
must
be
your
guests
in
his
home
and
of
course
we
were
only
too
glad
to
many
times
during
the
evening
repast
the
physician
s
eyes
wandered
to
the
face
of
his
ward
her
cheeks
were
glowing
almost
feverishly
and
the
light
in
her
eyes
was
unnatural
and
her
excited
chatter
he
was
sure
was
not
entirely
because
of
the
unexpected
arrival
of
her
friends
when
they
were
leaving
the
table
he
drew
her
aside
saying
muriel
i
would
like
to
see
you
in
my
the
girl
excused
herself
and
accompanied
him
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
the
physician
turned
and
placed
his
cool
hand
on
her
cheeks
and
brow
he
said
little
girl
are
you
ill
or
has
something
happened
that
is
troubling
you
to
his
great
surprise
muriel
threw
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
began
to
sob
no
uncle
lem
nothing
troubles
me
that
is
it
doesn
t
yet
uncle
barney
has
written
a
letter
to
my
own
father
to
tell
him
about
me
and
oh
uncle
lem
what
if
he
should
not
care
for
me
every
night
since
i
was
little
i
ve
prayed
for
that
dear
father
who
never
came
for
me
and
i
ve
prayed
god
to
send
him
to
me
some
time
because
my
so
loved
him
but
now
that
at
last
he
is
to
know
about
me
i
am
so
afraid
that
he
will
not
want
this
then
had
been
the
real
cause
of
her
feverish
excitement
the
physician
drew
muriel
down
beside
him
upon
a
couch
and
asked
her
to
tell
all
that
had
happened
he
had
never
known
about
the
address
in
the
little
iron
box
for
although
he
had
been
a
close
friend
of
ezra
bassett
s
in
their
boyhood
the
physician
had
been
away
much
of
the
time
in
later
years
dear
he
said
comfortingly
do
not
be
fearful
the
little
that
i
have
heard
of
your
artist
father
leads
me
to
believe
that
although
evidently
poor
he
was
possessed
of
high
ideals
and
was
very
talented
i
can
not
believe
that
he
has
purposely
neglected
you
all
of
these
years
now
dry
your
tears
and
go
back
to
your
friends
with
a
happy
heart
and
be
sure
that
the
tender
love
you
have
given
your
father
is
now
to
be
returned
to
when
the
girl
had
left
him
the
physician
bent
his
head
on
his
hands
and
so
he
was
to
lose
muriel
one
by
one
those
who
were
dear
to
him
had
left
him
and
in
his
old
age
he
was
to
be
alone
for
it
would
be
presumptuous
on
his
part
to
ask
so
lovely
a
woman
as
miss
gordon
to
share
the
little
he
had
to
offer
but
at
that
moment
he
recalled
the
tears
in
the
grey
eyes
and
the
break
in
the
voice
that
had
said
i
too
have
been
rising
he
thought
i
will
go
to
helen
and
ask
her
if
she
cares
to
share
my
chapter
xli
muriel
hears
from
her
father
once
again
it
was
spring
the
trees
about
high
cliffs
seminary
were
pale
green
and
pink
with
unfolding
fresh
young
leaves
and
in
the
orchard
back
of
the
school
the
cherry
peach
and
apple
trees
were
huge
bouquets
of
fragrant
bloom
spreading
a
feast
for
the
bees
that
hummed
cheerily
among
the
flowers
now
and
then
a
meadow
lark
sent
its
shaft
of
song
rejoicing
through
the
sunlit
morning
from
somewhere
beyond
the
tennis
courts
where
three
girls
were
playing
with
but
little
animation
however
as
the
first
real
spring
weather
was
too
warm
to
be
invigorating
i
wish
we
knew
what
has
happened
to
sadden
our
rilla
catherine
lambert
said
when
the
set
having
been
finished
the
girls
sat
on
a
bench
to
rest
she
came
back
to
school
after
the
christmas
holidays
so
joyous
that
i
thought
some
wonderful
thing
had
happened
like
a
romance
a
romance
and
muriel
not
yet
eighteen
years
of
age
this
protestingly
from
faith
but
catherine
heeding
not
the
interruption
continued
but
that
could
not
have
been
it
for
now
she
seems
very
sad
i
should
think
that
you
two
girls
who
are
so
intimate
with
her
might
ask
what
has
happened
surely
she
is
troubled
about
i
wish
i
could
say
that
i
have
noticed
no
change
in
muriel
joy
remarked
as
she
looked
meditatively
toward
the
orchard
but
i
can
not
for
she
is
changed
she
studies
harder
than
ever
before
if
that
can
possibly
be
miss
gordon
told
me
that
she
had
never
known
a
pupil
at
high
cliffs
to
make
such
i
wonder
if
miss
gordon
knows
what
is
troubling
muriel
i
am
sure
that
she
would
if
anyone
did
faith
said
but
joy
shook
her
head
no
miss
gordon
does
not
know
for
last
week
she
asked
me
to
come
to
her
apartment
at
an
hour
when
muriel
was
occupied
in
the
music
room
and
she
asked
me
if
i
had
noticed
a
change
in
rilla
and
if
so
had
i
any
idea
what
had
occasioned
it
i
said
that
we
all
realized
that
muriel
seemed
sad
but
that
we
did
not
know
the
reason
then
miss
gordon
declared
that
she
would
write
doctor
winslow
who
has
been
in
the
south
for
a
month
with
a
patient
and
ask
him
what
he
thought
might
be
troubling
his
ward
if
this
source
of
possible
information
fails
miss
gordon
will
ask
rilla
while
these
three
friends
were
discussing
muriel
as
they
sat
out
by
the
tennis
court
that
maiden
was
seated
alone
beneath
the
little
pine
tree
that
had
been
her
comforter
in
those
first
lonely
days
before
she
had
become
acquainted
at
high
cliffs
in
her
hand
she
held
a
letter
and
there
were
unshed
tears
in
her
eyes
although
her
uncle
barney
s
name
was
signed
at
the
close
of
the
missive
muriel
knew
that
molly
had
penned
it
for
him
dearie
the
girl
read
there
s
no
news
yet
though
it
does
seem
like
there
ought
to
be
here
tis
may
and
the
letter
we
wrote
was
sent
last
december
folks
do
say
no
news
is
good
news
but
i
reckon
this
time
colleen
tisn
t
so
if
your
father
was
living
he
d
have
sent
some
sort
of
an
answer
it
would
be
going
against
nature
not
to
if
he
hadn
t
lost
the
letter
with
the
address
on
it
or
if
we
could
remember
it
we
d
write
again
twas
a
name
i
d
never
heard
before
nor
had
molly
i
reckon
that
old
letter
got
into
the
stove
somehow
and
so
there
s
no
way
to
write
again
seems
like
i
can
never
forgive
myself
if
the
fault
is
mine
your
loving
uncle
so
after
all
the
dream
ended
muriel
was
never
to
know
the
father
she
had
loved
so
long
with
a
sigh
that
was
half
a
sob
she
arose
and
walked
slowly
back
toward
the
school
when
she
saw
one
of
the
younger
pupils
racing
toward
her
muriel
storm
you
re
wanted
in
the
parlor
there
s
someone
to
see
you
it
s
a
man
and
he
s
elegant
muriel
s
heart
leaped
could
it
be
that
her
father
had
come
after
all
when
muriel
appeared
in
the
doorway
of
the
reception
room
miss
gordon
rose
as
did
the
man
who
was
at
her
side
advancing
with
outstretched
hands
the
principal
said
dear
girl
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
about
it
i
wasn
t
at
all
prepared
for
the
message
that
this
gentleman
has
brought
to
then
turning
to
the
man
who
was
gazing
with
unconcealed
interest
at
the
tall
beautiful
girl
miss
gordon
added
muriel
this
is
templeton
of
london
he
has
come
at
the
request
of
your
father
who
is
not
strong
enough
just
now
to
make
the
voyage
and
if
you
desire
you
are
to
return
with
templeton
at
once
your
passage
has
been
engaged
on
a
steamship
leaving
hoboken
tomorrow
at
the
girl
gazed
from
one
to
the
other
as
though
scarcely
able
to
comprehend
then
slowly
a
light
dawned
in
her
clear
hazel
eyes
and
she
said
my
father
my
own
father
he
wants
me
templeton
was
deeply
moved
and
stepping
forward
he
took
both
hands
of
the
girl
as
he
said
sincerely
indeed
miss
muriel
he
does
want
you
i
never
saw
a
man
more
affected
than
he
was
when
he
learned
that
he
had
a
daughter
living
he
wanted
to
come
to
you
at
once
but
he
has
been
ill
and
his
physician
advised
against
the
voyage
as
the
sea
is
none
too
quiet
in
the
spring
and
so
i
have
been
sent
to
accompany
you
to
your
father
if
you
will
trust
the
girl
s
questioning
gaze
turned
toward
miss
gordon
who
smilingly
nodded
it
is
right
dear
that
you
should
go
she
said
i
have
telephoned
to
winslow
and
he
will
be
here
this
afternoon
now
you
had
better
go
to
your
room
i
will
send
a
maid
to
help
you
upon
leaving
the
reception
room
muriel
had
gone
at
once
in
search
of
her
best
friends
and
had
found
them
all
in
joy
s
room
we
ve
been
hunting
for
you
everywhere
faith
said
we
wanted
you
to
make
a
fourth
on
the
courts
but
you
were
nowhere
about
so
we
had
to
play
then
the
speaker
paused
and
gazed
intently
at
the
morning
glow
in
the
face
of
her
friend
why
muriel
she
exclaimed
of
late
you
have
seemed
troubled
but
now
you
are
radiant
tell
us
what
has
although
every
moment
was
needed
for
preparing
for
departure
muriel
paused
long
enough
to
tell
these
her
dearest
friends
that
at
last
her
own
father
had
been
found
rilla
it
s
like
a
chapter
in
a
isn
t
it
joy
exclaimed
don
t
you
feel
strange
and
unreal
muriel
laughed
i
suppose
that
i
do
but
girls
i
haven
t
time
now
to
feel
anything
for
i
must
pack
and
be
ready
to
leave
for
new
york
on
the
evening
boat
uncle
lem
is
going
to
keep
me
at
the
hospital
tonight
and
i
am
to
meet
my
escort
at
hoboken
tomorrow
morning
before
it
had
been
a
whirl
of
a
day
and
when
at
last
came
the
hour
for
parting
with
miss
gordon
and
the
girls
who
had
been
such
loyal
friends
muriel
suddenly
realized
that
though
she
was
to
gain
much
she
also
was
losing
much
i
don
t
believe
anything
in
the
world
could
take
me
from
you
all
but
just
my
father
she
said
i
ll
prophesy
that
you
ll
see
us
soon
miss
gordon
said
briskly
for
she
knew
the
tears
were
near
luckily
the
whistle
of
the
boat
at
that
moment
warned
the
friends
that
they
must
go
ashore
but
they
stood
on
the
dock
and
waved
until
the
small
craft
was
out
of
sight
then
it
was
that
muriel
recalled
a
letter
that
miss
widdemere
had
given
her
at
the
last
moment
taking
it
from
her
coat
pocket
she
saw
that
it
was
from
gene
who
was
again
in
london
chapter
xlii
muriel
meets
her
father
to
the
surprised
delight
of
muriel
both
uncle
barney
and
little
zoeth
were
at
the
boat
to
bid
her
goodbye
doctor
winslow
had
at
once
wired
the
good
news
to
the
old
man
who
had
been
instrumental
in
finding
the
girl
s
father
and
his
deeply
furrowed
face
shone
with
joy
as
he
held
out
his
arms
to
rilla
heeding
not
at
all
the
jostling
throng
of
voyagers
who
were
eager
to
board
the
greater
steamer
who
is
your
pa
rilly
gal
what
d
the
lawyer
chap
tell
yo
about
him
muriel
shook
her
head
i
don
t
know
a
bit
more
about
it
than
you
do
uncle
barney
she
confessed
my
father
wished
me
to
form
my
own
opinion
when
i
met
him
and
so
he
asked
templeton
to
make
no
attempt
to
describe
him
to
me
i
m
glad
really
one
never
can
picture
people
as
they
truly
are
all
that
matters
to
me
is
that
he
is
my
then
doctor
lem
returned
having
attended
to
the
baggage
and
they
all
accompanied
rilla
to
her
stateroom
take
good
care
of
shags
for
me
were
her
last
words
to
zoeth
and
tell
him
i
ll
come
back
after
him
as
soon
as
ever
i
then
muriel
leaned
over
the
rail
and
waved
to
her
loved
ones
on
the
crowded
wharf
until
the
huge
steamer
had
swung
out
into
the
channel
the
voyage
although
of
great
interest
to
the
girl
who
so
loved
the
sea
was
uneventful
and
in
due
time
england
was
reached
and
so
this
is
london
muriel
said
one
foggy
morning
as
she
glanced
out
of
the
window
of
the
conveyance
which
templeton
had
engaged
to
take
them
to
their
destination
i
am
so
glad
that
my
father
does
not
live
in
the
then
she
inquired
is
he
a
farmer
templeton
rilla
recalled
that
when
in
tunkett
the
young
man
had
seemed
to
be
very
poor
but
he
might
have
sold
paintings
enough
since
then
to
have
bought
a
farm
templeton
s
expression
was
inscrutable
why
yes
miss
muriel
in
a
way
your
father
might
be
called
a
farmer
all
kinds
of
vegetables
and
stock
are
raised
on
his
place
doesn
t
wield
the
pitchfork
himself
these
days
he
is
rather
too
prosperous
for
how
glad
the
girl
was
when
they
were
out
on
the
open
road
the
hawthorn
hedges
were
white
with
bloom
and
so
high
that
in
many
places
they
could
not
see
over
them
into
the
parklike
grounds
they
were
passing
suddenly
muriel
touched
templeton
s
arm
and
lifted
a
glowing
face
hark
she
whispered
did
you
hear
it
over
there
in
the
hedgerow
there
it
is
again
oh
i
know
him
miss
gordon
has
often
read
the
poem
that
s
the
wise
thrush
he
sings
each
song
twice
over
lest
you
think
he
could
never
recapture
that
first
fine
careless
do
you
like
browning
s
poetry
templeton
well
really
miss
muriel
i
ve
never
had
much
time
to
read
verse
been
too
busy
studying
law
but
your
sets
quite
a
store
by
the
poets
he
tells
i
m
so
glad
was
the
radiant
reply
then
the
girl
fell
to
musing
how
she
hoped
that
her
dear
mother
knew
that
at
last
she
was
going
to
the
poor
artist
whom
she
had
so
loved
how
long
will
it
be
before
we
reach
the
farming
district
templeton
the
girl
was
again
gazing
out
of
the
window
at
her
side
these
homes
that
we
are
passing
are
like
the
great
old
castles
i
have
read
about
in
scott
s
books
and
thackeray
we
will
soon
reach
our
destination
was
the
reply
of
her
companion
then
leaning
forward
he
spoke
a
few
words
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
they
turned
down
a
side
road
that
narrowed
to
a
winding
lane
there
the
conveyance
stopped
and
templeton
directed
muriel
to
a
picturesque
cabin
half
hidden
among
trees
in
front
of
which
ran
a
shallow
babbling
stream
your
father
awaits
you
in
there
he
said
as
one
in
a
dream
muriel
crossed
the
rustic
bridge
and
approached
the
cabin
it
was
just
the
sort
of
a
home
that
an
artist
would
build
she
thought
timidly
she
knocked
on
the
closed
door
it
was
flung
open
by
a
man
nearing
middle
age
perhaps
but
whose
youthful
face
was
radiant
with
a
great
joy
taking
both
her
hands
he
gazed
at
her
devouringly
then
drawing
her
to
him
he
crushed
her
in
his
arms
as
he
said
his
voice
tense
with
emotion
my
rilla
s
own
little
girl

had
arrived
in

again
she
was
returning
to
the
home
of
her
ancestors
after
a
long
trip
to
switzerland
where
gene
had
visited
her
and
her
father
during
this
year
muriel
had
acquired
from
her
father
an
ease
of
manner
which
well
fitted
her
for
the
position
she
was
to
fill
invitations
to
the
debut
of
lady
muriel

crossing
the
atlantic
they
were
addressed
to
the
four
girls
at

to

beavers
and
helen
received
their
invitation
there
was
a
flush
of
pleasure
on
the
elder
lady
s
face
as
she
read
the
message
on
the
crested
card
helen
she
said
will
wonders
never
cease
the
viscount
of
wainwater
has
a
daughter
probably
she
has
been
away
at
school
all
these
years
and
that
is
why
we
have
not
heard
of
then
as
her
gaze
wandered
to
a
handsome
pictured
face
on
a
table
near
she
added
i
am
glad
now
that
gene
did
not
care
for
marianne
helen
laughed
mother
dear
she
said
what
a
matchmaker
you
are
it
is
unfortunate
that
brother
seems
to
care
for
muriel
daughter
replied
beavers
haughtily
i
wish
you
never
again
to
mention
the
name
of
that
seafaring
girl
in
my
presence
i
am
so
glad
that
your
brother
will
be
home
from
college
in
time
to
attend
the
the
day
of
the
great
event
had
arrived
helen
and
her
mother
were
dressed
and
waiting
for
the
carriage
to
convey
them
to
wainwater
castle
but
the
elder
woman
was
troubled
for
though
the
boat
from
america
had
docked
and
the
train
from
liverpool
had
arrived
two
hours
before
yet
gene
had
not
come
then
she
heard
his
voice
in
the
lower
hall
asking
where
is
my
mother
catching
her
outstretched
hands
he
exclaimed
admiringly
did
ever
a
chap
have
so
beautiful
a
mother
not
waiting
for
a
reply
he
added
wheedlingly
mother

i
right
in
believing
that
you
really
care
for
my
happiness

care

will
be
a
great
disappointment

the
girl

cried

regret
those
words
soon
after
the
last
guest

arrived
at
the
castle

orchestra
was
stilled
and
the

neighbors

pleasure

my
daughter
the
lady

of

was
scarcely
able
to
believe
what
she
had
heard
and
seen
as
one
in
a
trance
she
advanced
and
gene
leaped
to
meet
her
and
placed
muriel

hand
in
that
of
his
mother
