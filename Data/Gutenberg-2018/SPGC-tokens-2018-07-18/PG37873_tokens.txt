preface
this
book
is
not
meant
as
a
literary
work
for
i
am
not
and
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
literary
man
it
is
but
a
record
an
amplified
as
it
were
of
what
befell
me
during
my
solitary
peregrinations
in
hokkaido
and
a
collection
of
notes
and
observations
which
i
hope
will
prove
interesting
to
anthropologists
and
ethnologists
as
well
as
to
the
general
public
without
any
claim
to
infallibility
i
have
tried
to
take
an
and
sensible
view
of
everything
i
have
attempted
to
describe
in
most
cases
however
i
have
given
facts
without
passing
an
opinion
at
all
and
all
i
have
said
i
have
tried
to
express
as
simply
and
plainly
as
possible
so
as
not
to
give
rise
to
misunderstandings
there
are
a
few
points
which
i
want
to
make
quite
clear
first
that
i
went
to
hokkaido
entirely
on
my
own
account
and
for
my
own
satisfaction
next
that
i
accomplished
the
whole
journey
some
miles
out
of
which
were
ridden
on
horseback
and
on
a
rough
perfectly
alone
by
alone
i
mean
that
i
had
with
me
no
friends
no
servants
and
no
guides
my
baggage
consisted
of
next
to
nothing
so
far
as
articles
for
my
own
convenience
or
comfort
were
concerned
i
carried
no
provisions
and
no
tent
i
am
endowed
with
a
very
sensitive
nature
and
i
pride
myself
in
possessing
the
gift
of
adaptability
to
an
extreme
degree
and
this
may
partly
explain
why
and
how
i
could
live
so
long
with
and
like
the
ainu
whose
habits
and
customs
as
my
readers
will
see
are
somewhat
different
to
ours
when
i
go
to
a
country
i
do
my
best
to
be
like
one
of
the
natives
themselves
and
whether
they
are
savage
or
not
i
endeavour
to
show
respect
for
them
and
their
ideas
and
to
conform
to
their
customs
for
the
time
being
i
make
up
my
mind
that
what
is
good
for
them
must
be
good
enough
for
me
and
though
i
have
occasionally
had
to
swear
at
myself
for
doing
in
ainuland
as
the
ainu
does
especially
as
regards
the
food
i
was
not
much
the
worse
for
it
in
the
end
i
never
use
force
when
i
can
win
with
kindness
and
in
my
small
experience
in
hokkaido
and
other
countries
i
have
always
found
that
real
savages
in
their
simplicity
are
most
people
with
few
exceptions
they
are
dignified
and
sensible
and
the
chances
are
that
if
you
are
fair
to
them
they
will
be
fair
to
you
civilised
savages
and
barbarians
i
always
found
untrustworthy
and
dangerous
the
island
of
yezo
with
the
smaller
islands
near
its
coast
and
the
kurile
group
taken
together
are
called
the
hokkaido
the
hokkaido
extends
roughly
from
to
latitude
north
and
between
and
longitude
east
of
greenwich
my
view
of
the
origin
of
the
word
ainu
is
this
is
but
a
corruption
or
abbreviation
of
they
with
hair
or
hairy
men
or
else
of
come
with
hair
or
descended
hairy
considering
that
the
ainu
pride
themselves
above
all
things
on
their
hairiness
it
does
not
seem
improbable
to
me
that
this
may
be
the
correct
origin
of
the
word
and
that
they
called
themselves
after
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
their
race
the
word
ainu
is
a
generic
term
and
is
used
both
in
the
singular
and
plural
but
when
specifying
the
words
people
men
woman
are
generally
added
to
it
ainu
people
ainu
men
an
ainu
woman
utaragesh
several
ainu
women
the
ainu
population
of
yezo
is
roughly
reckoned
by
the
japanese
at
about
or
souls
but
at
least
half
this
number
are
and
in
my
opinion
and
i
have
visited
nearly
every
ainu
village
in
yezo
the
number
of
thoroughbred
ainu
does
not
exceed
souls
the
illustrations
in
this
book
are
my
own
and
are
the
reproductions
from
sketches
which
i
took
on
the
spot
they
may
not
show
much
artistic
merit
but
they
seem
to
me
to
be
characteristic
of
the
country
and
the
people
and
i
hope
that
my
readers
will
be
impressed
with
them
in
the
same
way

chapter
i
from
hakodate
to
mororran
volcano
bay
the
first
ainu
a
strange
institution
among
them
i
have
often
asked
myself
i
went
to
yezo
and
when
there
what
possessed
me
to
undertake
the
laborious
task
of
going
round
the
island
up
its
largest
rivers
travelling
through
jungles
and
round
lakes
climbing
its
highest
peaks
and
then
proceeding
to
the
kuriles
there
are
certain
things
in
one
life
that
can
not
be
accounted
for
and
the
journey
which
i
am
going
to
relate
is
one
of
them
pleasure
and
rest
were
the
two
principal
objects
which
had
primarily
induced
me
to
steer
northwards
but
it
was
my
fate
not
to
get
either
the
one
or
the
other
i
was
on
the
japanese
ship
the
rapidly
nearing
the
hakodate
head
which
we
soon
passed
we
entered
the
bay
and
the
town
of
hakodate
at
the
foot
of
the
peak
came
into
view
it
looked
extremely
pretty
with
its
houses
and
its
tiled
roofs
set
against
the
background
of
brown
rock
with
its
fringe
of
green
at
the
foot
as
we
cast
anchor
hundreds
of
coolies
carrying
on
their
backs
loads
of
dried
fish
and
seaweed
were
running
along
the
or
wharf
a
few
girls
in
their
pretty
gowns
and
with
umbrellas
were
toddling
along
on
their
wooden
clogs
and
a
crowd
of
loafers
stood
gazing
at
the
ship
as
she
came
to
anchor
the
peak
more
than
feet
high
was
towering
on
our
south
side
forming
a
peninsula
joined
to
the
mainland
by
a
sandy
isthmus
and
the
large
bay
swept
round
us
forming
nearly
a
circle
the
place
has
a
striking
resemblance
to
gibraltar
i
landed
and
put
up
at
a
where
i
was
in
hopes
of
learning
something
regarding
the
island
from
the
japanese
settlers
but
no
one
knew
anything
the
reports
that
there
were
no
roads
extending
beyond
a
few
miles
that
there
was
but
very
poor
and
scarce
accommodation
along
the
coast
that
the
ainu
who
lived
further
north
were
dirty
people
and
that
the
country
was
full
of
bears
were
certainly
not
encouraging
to
an
intending
traveller
i
must
confess
that
my
first
day
in
yezo
was
a
dull
one
but
the
second
day
i
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
a
a
resident
who
kindly
offered
me
his
hospitality
and
the
next
two
were
pleasantly
spent
at
his
house
in
conversation
with
a
friend
of
his
i
heard
the
remark
that
no
man
alone
could
possibly
complete
the
circuit
of
the
island
of
yezo
owing
to
the
difficulties
of
travel
and
my
readers
can
imagine
the
astonishment
of
my
interlocutors
when
i
meekly
said
that
if
no
one
had
ever
done
it
i
was
going
to
do
it
and
indeed
that
i
intended
to
set
out
alone
the
next
morning
impossible
said
one
you
are
too
young
and
too
delicate
absurd
said
my
kind
host
it
would
take
a
very
strong
man
to
do
it
a
man
who
could
stand
any
amount
of
hardships
and
roughing
at
the
same
time
he
gave
me
a
pitiful
look
which
undoubtedly
meant
you
are
a
mere
bag
of
skin
and
bones
however
the
bag
of
skin
and
bones
kept
his
word
notwithstanding
the
poor
opinion
that
his
new
friends
had
formed
of
him
the
preparations
for
my
journey
were
simple
in
two
large
japanese
baskets
i
packed
three
hundred
small
wooden
panels
for
a
large
supply
of
oil
colours
and
brushes
a
dozen
small
my
diary
three
pairs
of
boots
three
shirts
an
equal
number
of
pairs
of
woollen
stockings
a
revolver
and
a
hundred
cartridges
the
remainder
of
my
luggage
was
left
in
charge
of
till
my
return
i
did
not
burden
myself
with
either
provisions
or
a
tent
i
rose
early
the
following
morning
and
bade
to
my
kind
host
said
he
i
expect
we
shall
see
you
back
to
dinner
the
word
dinner
was
the
last
english
word
i
heard
from
the
mouth
of
an
englishman
and
it
was
five
long
months
before
i
heard
another
the
first
thirty
miles
of
my
journey
were
ridden
in
a
a
covered
cart
built
on
four
wheels
that
ought
to
have
been
round
but
were
not
there
were
no
springs
for
the
comfort
of
the
traveller
and
no
cushions
on
the
seats
the
conveyance
was
public
and
was
drawn
by
two
sturdy
ponies
the
driver
a
japanese
carried
a
brass
trumpet
on
which
he
continually
played
i
might
have
begun
my
story
by
the
usual
one
fine
day
if
unfortunately
the
day
on
which
i
started
the
rain
had
not
poured
in
torrents
a
japanese
policeman
and
a
girl
were
my
only
travelling
at
full
gallop
on
a
rough
road
in
a
trap
with
unsymmetrical
wheels
and
with
no
springs
during
a
heavy
storm
is
scarcely
what
one
would
call
a
pleasant
mode
of
progression
but
after
some
hours
of
being
knocked
about
we
went
fashion
first
up
a
steep
hill
then
down
on
the
other
side
giving
the
horses
a
rest
at
a
roadside
by
the
famous
lakes
of
zenzai
the
larger
of
these
two
lakes
the
is
extremely
picturesque
with
its
numerous
little
islands
wooded
with
deciduous
trees
in
shape
it
is
very
irregular
and
many
points
which
project
into
the
lake
add
to
the
loveliness
of
the
scene
while
the
high
ridge
over
which
i
had
come
on
the
one
side
and
the
rugged
volcano
of
komagatake
on
the
other
form
a
beautiful
background
to
the
limpid
sheet
of
water
the
outlet
of
this
lake
empties
itself
into
volcano
bay
of
the
komagatake
volcano
the
other
lake
though
smaller
is
quite
as
striking
and
possesses
the
same
characteristics
of
its
larger
brother
it
goes
by
the
name
of
a
peculiarity
of
these
lakes
is
that
they
abound
in
a
smallish
fish
the
which
is
greatly
appreciated
by
the
japanese
i
sat
down
in
the
on
the
soft
mats
and
my
japanese
lunch
was
served
to
me
on
a
tiny
table
there
was
water
soup
there
was
there
was
a
bowl
of
rice
and
raw
fish
the
fish
a
small
was
in
a
diminutive
dish
and
its
back
was
covered
by
a
leaf
the
head
projected
over
the
side
of
the
plate
on
the
leaf
were
placed
several
pieces
of
the
raw
flesh
which
had
apparently
been
removed
from
the
back
of
the
underlying
animal
as
i
had
been
long
accustomed
to
japanese
food
of
this
kind
i
ate
to
my
heart
content
when
to
my
great
horror
the
which
had
been
staring
at
me
with
its
round
eyes
relieved
of
the
weight
that
had
passed
from
its
back
into
my
digestive
organs
leaped
up
leaf
and
all
from
the
dish
and
fell
on
the
mat
all
the
vital
parts
had
carefully
been
left
in
the
fish
and
the
wretched
creature
was
still
alive
horrible
i
cried
violently
pushing
away
the
table
and
walking
out
disgusted
to
the
great
surprise
of
the
people
present
who
expected
me
to
revel
in
the
deliciousness
of
the
dish
for
days
and
days
after
i
could
see
in
my
mind
the
staring
eyes
of
the
watching
each
movement
of
my
chopsticks
and
its
own
back
being
eaten
piecemeal
wherever
i
went
this
big
eye
stood
before
me
and
increased
or
diminished
in
size
according
to
my
being
more
or
less
lonely
more
or
less
hungry
i
had
often
eaten
raw
fish
before
but
never
had
i
eaten
live
fish
the
journey
in
the
was
resumed
that
afternoon
and
more
dead
than
alive
i
alighted
in
the
evening
at
mori
a
small
japanese
village
at
the
foot
of
the
komagatake
volcano
the
peak
of
this
mountain
is
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
but
its
crater
is
at
a
somewhat
lower
altitude
up
to
a
certain
height
it
is
thickly
wooded
with
deciduous
trees
and
firs
thence
its
slopes
are
bare
of
vegetation
rugged
in
form
and
very
rich
in
colour
it
makes
part
of
a
volcanic
mass
which
extends
from
the
esan
volcano
further
south
to
the
limit
of
the
shiribeshi
province
crossing
straight
through
the
province
of
oshima
as
far
as
the
yurapdake
mountain
komagatake
is
one
of
the
most
majestic
and
picturesque
mountains
i
have
ever
seen
as
it
possesses
lovely
lines
on
nearly
every
side
its
isolation
and
sudden
sharp
elevation
rising
as
it
does
directly
from
the
sea
gives
of
course
a
grand
appearance
to
its
weird
and
sterile
slopes
which
are
covered
with
cinders
pumice
and
lava
i
went
over
to
mororran
across
volcano
bay
and
the
following
morning
i
risked
my
life
on
a
small
craft
which
took
me
over
to
mombets
from
this
place
i
rode
on
to
uso
and
aputa
two
ainu
villages
at
a
short
distance
from
each
other
coming
from
japan
the
first
thing
that
strikes
a
traveller
in
the
ainu
country
is
the
odour
of
dried
fish
which
one
can
smell
everywhere
the
next
is
the
great
number
of
crows
the
scavengers
of
the
country
lastly
the
volcanic
nature
of
the
island
on
visiting
an
ainu
village
what
impressed
me
most
were
the
miserable
and
filthy
huts
compared
with
the
neat
and
clean
japanese
houses
the
poverty
and
almost
appalling
dirt
of
the
people
and
their
gentle
submissive
nature
i
shall
not
dwell
at
length
on
these
volcano
bay
ainu
as
this
part
of
the
country
is
comparatively
civilised
and
has
been
travelled
over
by
many
people
previous
to
my
going
there
besides
most
of
them
have
intermarried
with
japanese
and
have
consequently
adopted
many
japanese
customs
and
manners
the
ainu
of
the
coast
build
their
huts
generally
on
a
single
line
near
the
shore
and
each
family
has
its
dug
out
canoe
drawn
up
on
the
beach
ready
to
hand
when
wanted
the
huts
are
small
and
and
they
have
no
furniture
or
bedding
to
speak
of
the
roof
and
walls
are
thatched
with
but
so
imperfectly
that
wind
and
rain
find
easy
access
through
their
reedy
covering
curiosity
is
the
only
good
quality
which
i
ever
possessed
and
in
obedience
to
it
i
poked
my
nose
into
several
of
the
huts
along
the
beach
this
was
a
mistake
on
my
part
for
in
the
ainu
country
the
nose
is
the
last
thing
one
ought
to
poke
in
anywhere
i
was
more
than
astonished
to
see
how
human
beings
could
live
in
such
filth
the
natives
kindly
asked
me
to
enter
and
i
of
course
did
so
stooping
low
through
the
small
door
and
raising
the
mat
which
protects
the
aperture
when
i
was
in
i
could
smell
a
great
deal
more
than
i
could
see
for
the
east
window
the
size
of
a
small
handkerchief
and
the
only
one
in
the
hut
did
not
give
light
enough
to
illuminate
the
premises
however
i
soon
got
accustomed
to
the
dimness
and
then
i
could
make
out
my
surroundings
clearly
enough
there
was
an
old
man
perfectly
naked
with
a
fine
head
long
white
hair
and
beard
sitting
on
the
ground
among
a
mass
of
seaweeds
which
he
was
disentangling
and
packing
two
young
women
and
two
young
men
with
bright
intelligent
eyes
and
high
were
helping
him
in
his
work
in
their
quiet
gentle
way
they
all
brought
their
hands
forward
each
rubbed
the
palms
together
and
lifting
the
arms
slowly
stroked
their
hair
and
the
men
their
beard
with
the
backs
of
their
hands
while
the
women
rubbed
the
first
finger
under
the
nose
from
the
left
to
the
right
this
is
their
salutation
and
it
is
most
graceful
they
seemed
pleased
to
see
me
and
asked
me
to
sit
down
as
there
were
neither
chairs
nor
sofas
stools
nor
cushions
i
squatted
on
the
ground
illustration
ainu
woman
saluting
most
ainu
of
volcano
bay
understand
japanese
and
they
also
speak
it
interpolating
ainu
words
when
necessary
so
i
began
a
conversation
my
presence
did
not
seem
to
disturb
them
or
arouse
their
curiosity
and
beyond
gazing
at
the
buttons
on
my
white
coat
they
did
not
appear
to
be
struck
by
me
evidently
the
buttons
were
much
more
interesting
to
them
than
the
person
who
wore
them
now
and
then
they
uttered
a
few
words
but
whenever
one
spoke
some
of
the
company
seemed
to
be
angry
as
at
an
impertinence
or
a
breach
of
etiquette
men
and
women
wore
large
or
pieces
of
red
or
black
cloth
which
added
a
great
deal
to
their
picturesqueness
but
the
women
were
disfigured
by
a
long
moustache
tattooed
across
the
face
from
ear
to
ear
rough
drawings
adorn
the
arms
and
hands
of
the
women
and
some
of
the
younger
females
would
undoubtedly
be
if
not
disfigured
by
the
tattoos
for
they
carry
themselves
well
when
walking
and
possess
comely
features
judging
from
appearances
i
should
think
them
very
passionate
coming
out
of
the
hut
i
saw
a
scene
which
i
shall
never
forget
two
naked
boys
covered
with
horrible
skin
eruptions
had
got
hold
of
a
large
out
of
which
they
were
endeavouring
to
make
a
meal
round
them
were
gathered
about
thirty
dogs
wild
with
hunger
barking
furiously
at
the
frightened
children
and
attacking
and
fighting
them
for
that
miserable
repast
i
walked
along
the
beach
and
endeavoured
to
make
friends
with
some
of
the
ainu
who
were
less
shy
than
the
others
one
little
girl
was
especially
picturesque
she
was
only
about
ten
and
her
large
eyes
tanned
complexion
white
teeth
the
tiny
tattoo
on
her
upper
lip
her
uncombed
long
black
hair
flying
around
her
and
her
red
cloth
made
her
indeed
one
of
the
quaintest
studies
of
colour
that
i
have
seen
in
my
life
i
got
her
to
sit
for
me
and
while
i
was
painting
her
an
old
man
the
chief
of
the
village
dressed
up
in
a
gaudy
costume
with
a
crown
of
willow
shavings
on
his
head
came
to
me
and
made
his
salaams
he
bore
the
name
of
angotsuro
and
before
all
his
salaams
were
over
he
found
himself
caught
in
the
action
in
my
many
of
the
villagers
had
collected
round
and
one
of
them
a
expressed
the
wish
that
i
should
paint
the
chief
in
colours
like
the
picture
of
the
girl
i
asked
for
nothing
better
and
started
an
of
him
the
excitement
of
the
natives
who
were
witnessing
the
operation
grew
greater
and
greater
as
each
new
ornament
in
the
chief
dress
was
put
in
the
picture
some
seemed
to
approve
of
it
others
were
grumpy
and
apparently
objected
to
the
picture
being
taken
at
all
the
was
indeed
a
stormy
one
and
though
the
chief
had
his
regal
crown
knocked
off
his
head
two
or
three
times
by
the
party
he
sat
well
for
his
likeness
especially
as
i
promised
him
in
japanese
that
when
the
picture
was
completed
he
should
be
given
a
few
coins
and
two
buttons
off
my
coat
it
was
while
portraying
him
that
i
noticed
what
extraordinary
effects
colours
produce
on
those
whose
eyes
are
unaccustomed
to
them
a
man
in
the
crowd
would
get
excited
and
open
his
eyes
wide
and
show
his
teeth
every
time
i
happened
to
touch
with
my
brush
the
cobalt
blue
on
my
palette
other
colours
had
not
the
same
effect
on
him
his
eyes
were
continually
fixed
on
the
blue
anxiously
waiting
for
the
brush
to
dip
in
it
and
this
would
then
send
him
into
fits
of
merriment
i
squeezed
some
blue
paint
from
a
tube
on
to
the
palm
of
his
hand
and
he
nearly
went
off
his
head
with
delight
he
sprang
and
jumped
and
yelled
and
then
ran
some
way
off
where
he
squatted
on
the
sand
still
in
admiration
of
the
blue
dab
on
his
hand
still
grinning
at
intervals
with
irrepressible
enjoyment
where
the
point
of
the
joke
was
no
one
but
himself
ever
knew
when
the
picture
was
finished
i
had
no
little
trouble
to
keep
the
many
fingers
of
my
audience
off
the
wet
painting
moreover
some
person
endowed
with
kindly
feelings
threw
a
handful
of
sand
in
my
face
which
nearly
blinded
me
for
the
moment
and
partly
ruined
the
two
pictures
i
had
painted
the
money
and
the
buttons
were
duly
paid
to
angotsuro
and
i
moved
on
that
same
evening
i
went
out
for
a
walk
it
was
a
very
dark
night
and
i
love
dark
nights
when
for
some
years
you
have
done
nothing
but
see
strange
things
and
new
places
there
is
indeed
a
great
fascination
in
going
about
in
complete
darkness
it
rests
both
your
eyes
and
your
brain
i
walked
for
some
time
along
the
beach
stumbling
against
the
canoes
drawn
on
shore
and
against
anything
that
was
in
my
way
hut
after
hut
was
passed
but
everything
was
silent
there
was
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
not
a
light
to
be
seen
the
ainu
are
early
people
they
retire
with
the
sun
i
walked
on
yet
farther
and
farther
afield
till
through
the
thatched
wall
of
one
of
the
huts
i
discerned
a
faint
light
i
stood
and
listened
the
sad
voice
of
a
man
was
singing
a
weird
weird
song
the
weirdest
song
i
have
ever
heard
then
came
a
pause
and
another
voice
even
more
plaintive
than
the
first
continued
the
same
air
what
with
the
strange
melody
in
the
hut
the
soothing
noise
of
the
waves
gently
breaking
on
the
shingle
and
the
distant
howling
of
dogs
or
wolves
the
mystic
effect
was
such
that
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
and
i
crept
into
the
hut
a
fire
was
burning
in
the
centre
but
it
had
almost
gone
out
leaving
a
lot
of
smoke
three
old
men
were
sitting
on
the
ground
they
decidedly
looked
as
if
they
did
not
expect
me
but
after
their
first
astonishment
was
over
they
asked
me
to
squat
down
in
a
corner
and
there
i
was
left
to
amuse
myself
while
they
resumed
their
singing
and
drinking
of
the
latter
they
seemed
to
have
had
enough
already
but
all
the
same
several
wooden
bowls
about
five
inches
in
diameter
and
two
deep
were
passed
round
and
emptied
in
no
time
the
more
they
drank
the
wilder
and
more
melancholy
the
song
became
only
one
at
a
time
sang
and
he
would
begin
in
a
very
low
tone
of
voice
and
go
up
in
a
gradually
getting
awfully
excited
then
all
at
once
he
would
stop
as
if
the
effort
had
been
too
great
for
him
his
head
drooped
and
he
seemed
to
sleep
then
suddenly
waking
up
coming
back
to
his
full
senses
in
a
startling
manner
he
drained
one
of
the
bowls
which
meantime
had
been
refilled
and
resumed
the
song
the
three
men
were
facing
each
other
and
so
absorbed
were
they
in
their
music
that
though
i
was
not
more
than
four
feet
away
from
them
they
seemed
to
have
forgotten
me
altogether
i
was
so
impressed
with
the
strangeness
of
the
song
that
i
pulled
out
my
pencil
and
paper
to
write
down
the
air
as
there
was
no
light
but
the
flicker
of
the
fire
i
turned
the
white
leaf
of
my
toward
it
to
see
what
i
was
writing
this
caught
the
eye
of
one
of
the
men
he
woke
up
startled
from
his
musical
dream
jumped
to
his
feet
and
made
a
dash
for
me
yelling
some
words
which
i
did
not
understand
and
holding
over
my
head
something
that
i
could
not
distinguish
at
the
moment
owing
to
the
dimness
of
the
light
standing
thus
he
paused
evidently
waiting
for
an
answer
to
something
he
had
said
it
came
from
one
of
the
other
fellows
who
pushed
him
so
violently
as
to
send
him
sprawling
on
the
floor
while
what
he
held
in
his
hand
a
big
heavy
pointed
knife
fell
and
stuck
deep
in
the
ground
about
an
inch
from
my
toes
a
dispute
arose
among
themselves
but
among
the
ainu
everything
ends
up
in
a
drink
the
large
wooden
bowls
were
again
refilled
grand
bows
were
made
to
me
and
they
all
stroked
their
hair
and
beard
several
times
a
sign
of
great
respect
i
was
then
handed
one
of
the
bowls
and
made
to
swallow
the
contents
but
heavens
never
have
i
felt
any
liquid
work
its
way
down
so
far
had
i
swallowed
fire
it
could
not
have
been
as
bad
and
indeed
it
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
liquid
fire
as
the
night
was
wearing
fast
and
the
old
fellows
had
got
on
well
with
their
drink
the
became
rather
too
languid
and
monotonous
and
i
crept
out
of
the
hut
as
quietly
as
i
had
entered
it
not
without
first
giving
the
inmates
something
for
their
trouble
i
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
my
way
back
to
my
less
musical
quarters
and
passing
too
close
to
some
of
the
other
huts
the
dogs
which
infest
all
ainu
villages
barked
furiously
and
roused
the
whole
place
i
learned
afterwards
that
it
is
an
ainu
fashion
to
try
a
man
courage
this
is
done
in
the
way
in
which
my
musical
friends
tried
mine
namely
by
making
a
sudden
rush
with
a
knife
as
if
death
and
destruction
were
imminent
which
to
a
perfect
stranger
unconscious
of
the
strain
of
bluff
in
the
action
is
not
very
reassuring
if
the
person
to
be
tested
is
aware
of
this
fashion
he
has
to
submit
to
an
unlimited
number
of
whacks
administered
to
him
on
his
bare
back
with
a
heavy
these
tests
of
a
man
courage
and
endurance
are
called
the
in
the
first
instance
it
is
done
in
a
certain
sense
and
not
meaning
to
hurt
one
should
however
the
person
apparently
so
dangerously
threatened
show
fright
or
signs
of
cowardice
he
loses
the
respect
of
the
ainu
unless
he
has
the
happy
thought
of
giving
them
a
sufficient
quantity
of
some
intoxicating
liquor
to
make
them
all
drunk
which
is
a
sure
means
of
turning
the
most
inimical
ainu
you
may
meet
into
your
fast
friend
even
if
you
have
had
a
deadly
feud
with
him
the
second
way
with
the
of
course
is
a
painful
process
and
the
ainu
have
recourse
to
it
when
it
is
necessary
to
determine
the
relative
amount
of
courage
possessed
by
certain
members
of
a
community
the
one
that
can
stand
the
greater
number
of
blows
is
naturally
entitled
to
the
respect
and
admiration
of
his
neighbours
and
he
is
elected
leader
in
or
similar
expeditions
at
the
election
of
a
new
chief
when
the
chief
line
of
descendants
dies
out
this
process
i
was
told
is
often
practised
for
bravery
is
the
first
quality
which
an
ainu
chief
must
possess
at
aputa
through
some
of
the
i
was
able
to
pick
up
a
great
number
of
ainu
words
which
were
most
useful
to
me
afterwards
and
from
that
gradually
increasing
my
stock
of
words
i
soon
knew
enough
to
understand
a
little
and
also
to
make
myself
understood
one
day
i
went
along
the
coast
to
the
next
village
of
repun
and
then
retraced
my
steps
to
aputa
as
there
was
nothing
of
interest
at
the
former
place
an
excursion
which
i
enjoyed
more
was
to
the
toya
lake
with
its
three
pretty
islands
in
the
centre
and
the
magnificent
uso
volcano
on
its
southern
shores
the
walk
there
and
back
was
hardly
fifteen
miles
over
a
mountain
track
and
through
forests
of
and
oaks
the
lake
is
about
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
is
about
five
miles
in
diameter
its
shores
are
surrounded
with
hills
which
have
grassy
terraces
at
a
certain
altitude
extending
especially
towards
the
shores
of
the
lake
the
barren
uso
volcano
with
its
sterile
slopes
is
a
great
contrast
to
the
beautiful
green
of
the
comparatively
luxuriant
vegetation
of
the
lower
altitudes
the
lake
finds

the
mororran
distinguished
by

mororran
has

it
would
be
the
best
future
port
in
hokkaido
if
the
anchorage
were
of
a
larger
capacity
in
more
speculative
hands
than
the
japanese
this
port
would
be
a
great
rival
to
hakodate
it

of
a
peninsula
which
forms
a
bay

the

the
picturesque

smaller

huge

its

a
mere
streak
of

by
the
side
of
the

apart
from
the
natural
loveliness
of
the

it
has
indeed
no
claims
to
consideration
at

days

called
by

chapter
ii
from
mororran
to
the
saru
river
thirteen
more
miles
in
a
for
i
was
still
in
civilised
regions
took
me
to
horobets
a
village
half
ainu
and
half
japanese
the
ainu
often
name
their
villages
after
rivers
and
this
word
horobets
which
in
english
means
large
river
is
an
instance
of
this
custom
in
southern
japan
previous
to
my
visiting
yezo
i
was
told
that
nearly
all
the
ainu
of
horobets
had
become
good
christians
if
such
were
the
case
which
i
do
not
wish
my
readers
to
doubt
the
small
experience
which
i
had
here
led
me
to
believe
that
good
christians
often
make
very
bad
heathens
i
left
all
my
baggage
in
a
at
the
entrance
of
the
village
and
taking
my
with
me
i
went
for
a
walk
along
the
beach
i
saw
a
crowd
of
ainu
in
the
distance
and
i
hurried
up
to
them
they
were
busy
skinning
a
large
cutting
it
into
pieces
with
their
long
knives
they
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
me
and
this
disregard
of
what
would
be
to
others
a
cause
of
curiosity
and
interruption
i
afterwards
found
to
be
a
characteristic
of
the
ainu
they
are
seldom
distracted
from
any
particular
idea
that
occupies
their
mind
at
a
certain
moment
in
fact
they
are
so
little
accustomed
to
reflect
at
all
that
it
seems
almost
impossible
for
them
to
think
of
two
things
at
the
same
time
of
all
the
existing
races
of
mankind
they
may
be
said
to
be
the
most
purely
stark
naked
with
their
long
hair
streaming
in
the
wind
they
formed
a
picturesque
group
what
a
chance
for
a
sketch
i
sat
down
on
the
sand
opened
my
and
dashed
off
a
picture
when
a
young
lad
who
had
taken
his
share
of
the
fish
came
over
to
see
what
i
was
doing
what
is
it
he
asked
me
in
broken
japanese
to
which
question
i
answered
that
i
was
painting
the
group
of
them
the
news
seemed
to
give
him
a
shock
he
rejoined
the
others
excitedly
muttered
some
words
and
apparently
told
them
that
i
had
painted
the
whole
group
fish
and
all
had
anyone
among
them
been
struck
by
lightning
they
could
certainly
not
have
looked
more
dismayed
i
never
knew
until
then
that
painting
could
have
such
an
overpowering
effect
on
people
except
perhaps
when
one
has
sat
to
an
amateur
artist
for
one
own
likeness
the
result
of
which
is
often
one
of
dumb
and
blank
amazement
anger
and
disgust
naturally
followed
the
fish
was
thrown
aside
but
not
the
knives
armed
with
which
they
all
rushed
at
my
back
the
sudden
change
of
ideas
had
evidently
made
them
exceedingly
angry
the
grumbling
became
very
loud
and
louder
still
when
they
saw
me
complacently
giving
the
finishing
touches
to
the
fish
which
was
now
left
alone
and
not
as
before
shifted
about
every
second
they
grew
wilder
and
wilder
until
one
of
the
crowd
shouted
in
my
ears
some
words
which
sounded
remarkably
like
swearing
nevertheless
it
takes
more
than
that
to
stop
me
from
sketching
but
by
jove
i
exclaimed
when
all
of
a
sudden
a
rush
was
made
on
me
my
picture
palette
and
brushes
were
snatched
out
of
my
hands
and
smashed
or
flung
away
and
i
found
myself
stretched
on
the
sand
my
late
involuntary
sitters
holding
me
down
fast
by
the
legs
and
arms
a
big
knife
was
kept
well
over
my
head
so
that
i
should
not
attempt
to
move
while
the
painting
on
a
heavy
wooden
panel
was
being
mercilessly
destroyed
by
others
if
these
are
christians
well
i
am
were
i
must
confess
the
first
words
that
rose
to
my
lips
it
is
indeed
difficult
to
describe
how
and
what
one
feels
when
to
all
appearance
one
is
going
to
be
murdered
for
painting
a
fish
my
first
thought
of
course
went
to
my
parents
my
next
was
what
a
nuisance
it
was
to
be
murdered
with
the
sun
shining
in
my
eyes
so
that
i
could
not
even
see
who
would
give
me
the
finishing
touch
all
the
events
of
my
life
the
bad
ones
first
flashed
across
my
mind
in
those
few
seconds
and
then
i
almost
began
to
feel
as
if
i
had
made
my
first
steps
into
the
other
world
and
i
could
see
angels
and
devils
disputing
for
my
company
the
devils
of
course
having
by
far
the
largest
claims
the
bitterness
of
death
had
in
some
sense
passed
when
to
my
great
astonishment
and
with
a
few
but
very
sound
kicks
i
was
made
to
understand
that
i
could
get
up
and
go
the
sensation
of
being
brought
back
to
life
when
one
has
made
up
mind
to
be
dead
notwithstanding
the
abrupt
manner
in
which
it
was
produced
was
indeed
a
pleasant
one
i
did
get
up
and
pretty
quick
i
can
tell
you
but
only
to
see
my
poor
wooden
floating
in
the
sea
my
brushes
stuck
here
and
there
in
the
sand
and
the
sketch
utterly
destroyed
my
assailants
were
about
fifteen
or
twenty
and
i
was
alone
stupidly
enough
and
relying
on
the
christianity
of
the
people
i
had
not
burdened
myself
with
the
extra
weight
of
my
revolver
i
had
left
it
with
my
heavy
luggage
in
the
small
japanese
where
i
had
put
up
nearly
a
mile
away
the
japanese
was
at
washibets
another
village
some
miles
off
nothing
was
left
for
me
but
to
pick
up
the
few
unbroken
brushes
which
were
within
easy
reach
and
retire
but
i
was
neither
frightened
nor
conquered
and
i
swore
to
myself
that
i
would
have
my
revenge
i
hurried
to
the
took
my
revolver
and
filled
my
pocket
with
cartridges
then
i
ran
back
to
the
spot
where
i
had
sketched
and
been
assaulted
there
they
all
were
as
i
had
left
them
one
of
them
mimicking
me
with
the
broken
palette
which
he
had
fished
out
of
the
sea
i
had
kept
well
behind
some
thick
brushwood
so
that
they
should
not
see
me
and
for
some
time
watched
them
unobserved
the
imitation
was
perfect
the
impromptu
raphael
hair
was
long
enough
to
give
him
the
look
of
an
artist
and
he
was
sufficiently
brave
to
carry
on
his
imitation
sketching
under
a
shower
of
missiles
and
sand
thrown
at
him
by
his
friends
and
companions
as
he
turned
his
head
i
recognised
in
my
the
man
who
had
been
holding
the
knife
over
my
head
about
an
hour
before
and
also
the
very
person
who
had
given
me
the
soundest
kick
just
like
a
if
my
sketching
had
not
lasted
long
his
parody
was
even
shorter
i
sprang
out
from
the
brushwood
screen
and
caught
him
by
the
throat
pointing
my
revolver
at
his
head
and
telling
him
in
japanese
to
follow
me
to
the
another
man
attacking
me
from
behind
stabbed
me
in
my
left
arm
but
not
very
severely
as
i
saw
him
just
in
time
to
avoid
his
blow
the
sight
of
my
revolver
had
a
salutary
effect
on
my
hairy
friends
and
they
were
done
out
of
their
fun
when
keeping
them
at
bay
i
told
them
that
if
they
did
not
follow
me
they
would
all
be
dead
men
before
they
knew
where
they
were
they
had
seen
guns
of
the
japanese
and
they
knew
the
effects
of
them
so
the
saucy
gentlemen
stroked
their
hair
and
beard
and
made
signs
of
submission
and
obedience
however
i
was
not
to
be
easily
appeased
as
it
was
necessary
to
give
them
a
lesson
to
prevent
the
same
thing
happening
to
future
travellers
so
i
made
them
march
in
front
of
me
not
caring
to
have
them
at
my
back
and
thus
took
them
all
to
the
japanese
where
they
were
duly
arrested
the
japanese
are
very
severe
with
recalcitrant
ainu
and
my
assailants
would
have
been
unmercifully
dealt
with
had
it
not
been
for
their
wives
and
children
who
came
to
me
begging
me
to
forgive
their
husbands
and
fathers
for
what
they
had
done
i
willingly
did
so
on
condition
that
they
should
all
come
and
prostrate
themselves
at
my
feet
imploring
pardon
and
forgiveness
and
offering
submission
as
well
as
confessing
their
sorrow
this
penitential
function
was
reluctantly
fixed
by
the
japanese
policeman
the
only
one
in
the
place
at
a
late
hour
in
the
afternoon
during
the
interval
as
i
fortunately
had
a
large
supply
of
painting
materials
i
managed
to
repaint
from
memory
the
scene
represented
in
the
sketch
destroyed
the
evening
came
and
the
little
japanese
policeman
brought
the
resigned
and
humbled
ainu
to
the
inn
their
wives
and
relatives
followed
and
they
all
looked
supremely
mournful
and
sad
i
sat
japanese
fashion
on
the
small
verandah
on
the
and
the
policeman
placed
the
ainu
on
a
line
in
front
of
me
and
then
came
to
sit
by
my
side
he
then
addressed
them
partly
in
the
ainu
language
partly
in
japanese
and
bestowed
on
them
names
which
went
well
to
the
point
he
scolded
them
harshly
and
asked
them
why
they
had
assaulted
me
one
of
them
as
grave
as
a
judge
with
his
eyes
cast
down
and
in
a
voice
came
forward
and
said
that
if
once
you
have
your
likeness
taken
you
have
to
give
up
your
life
to
it
and
it
brings
illness
to
yourself
to
your
children
your
parents
and
your
neighbours
not
only
that
but
as
i
had
many
people
together
famine
was
sure
to
fall
on
the
country
then
he
added
and
he
seemed
positive
of
what
he
was
talking
about
then
there
was
a
fish
the
stranger
the
ainu
have
no
word
for
painting
and
had
we
not
destroyed
his
all
the
fish
would
have
disappeared
from
the
sea
and
all
the
ainu
would
have
died
of
starvation
which
was
a
terrible
contingency
as
the
ainu
live
mainly
by
fishing
we
have
not
hurt
the
stranger
continued
this
hairy
representative
of
master
eustache
de
pierre
and
now
that
all
the
ainu
and
the
fish
he
made
are
destroyed
we
are
safe
you
are
mistaken
said
i
when
by
the
aid
of
the
policeman
i
understood
the
meaning
of
this
long
harangue
and
i
produced
the
large
sketch
of
the
scene
which
i
had
repainted
from
memory
this
certainly
beat
them
they
could
hardly
believe
their
own
eyes
and
looked
at
each
other
as
if
some
great
calamity
were
approaching
i
have
no
doubt
that
they
considered
me
an
evil
spirit
and
as
such
too
powerful
to
be
contended
with
discretion
was
their
best
part
of
valour
as
they
proved
one
by
one
they
approached
the
verandah
sat
in
front
of
me
rubbed
their
hands
together
stroked
their
hair
and
beard
three
times
and
three
times
each
put
his
head
down
to
my
feet
begging
my
pardon
the
ainu
women
and
children
who
had
assembled
in
the
back
yard
where
the
function
took
place
were
crying
and
moaning
piteously
the
most
trying
part
for
me
was
of
course
to
keep
serious
during
this
long
performance
and
i
was
indeed
glad
when
it
was
all
over
when
my
supremacy
was
acknowledged
and
my
immunity
from
further
insult
secured
when
submission
had
been
made
and
such
whips
and
stings
of
outrageous
fortune
as
might
come
from
the
painting
of
a
fish
had
been
humbly
accepted
the
ainu
are
gentle
and
mild
by
nature
but
like
all
ignorant
people
they
are
extremely
superstitious
and
superstition
is
a
powerful
excitant
nevertheless
they
are
good
people
in
their
own
way
and
it
must
not
be
inferred
from
this
small
experience
of
mine
that
they
are
bullies
for
they
are
not
the
superstition
regarding
the
reproduction
of
images
is
common
all
through
the
east
with
the
exception
of
the
japanese
and
in
many
parts
of
europe
itself
strange
ideas
are
connected
with
in
spain
or
italy
many
a
girl
of
the
lower
classes
would
think
herself
dishonoured
if
she
happened
to
be
sketched
unawares
or
if
her
picture
were
shown
without
the
consent
of
her
parents
brothers
relatives
and
the
parish
priest
however
these
horobets
ainu
are
said
since
civilisation
has
set
in
in
that
part
of
yezo
of
late
years
to
have
become
untrustworthy
and
violent
they
are
more
given
to
drunkenness
than
their
neighbours
as
they
can
procure
from
the
japanese
stronger
beverages
than
their
own
japanese
wine
of
inferior
quality
is
sold
and
exchanged
in
large
quantities
and
has
the
same
fatal
effects
on
them
as
rum
our
had
on
the
american
indians
i
was
not
sorry
to
leave
a
village
which
had
displayed
so
little
appreciation
of
my
art
i
took
two
ponies
and
two
to
one
of
which
was
lashed
my
baggage
while
i
sat
on
the
other
riding
is
a
delightful
pastime
when
you
have
a
good
horse
and
a
good
saddle
but
not
when
you
have
to
look
after
two
vicious
animals
and
are
yourself
perched
on
a
rough
wooden
moreover
ainu
are
perhaps
the
most
uncomfortable
of
their
kind
the
illustration
shows
one
of
them
it
is
made
with
a
rough
solid
wooden
frame
of
which
the
front
and
back
parts
are
semicircular
one
large
hole
is
perforated
in
each
of
these
to
allow
ropes
to
be
passed
through
under
this
frame
are
two
mat
cushions
or
pads
which
are
somehow
supposed
to
fit
the
pony
back
and
by
means
of
three
ropes
one
of
which
is
passed
under
the
pony
body
and
fastened
on
each
side
of
the
saddle
while
the
others
hang
loose
across
its
chest
and
under
its
tail
respectively
the
is
made
to
remain
in
position
either
going
uphill
downhill
or
on
level
ground
stirrups
of
course
there
are
none
and
mounting
involves
some
difficulties
at
first
one
has
to
face
one
pony
and
place
the
left
foot
on
the
lift
oneself
up
and
swing
right
round
describing
of
a
circle
before
attaining
one
seat
in
the
saddle
if
distances
are
miscalculated
in
this
gymnastic
feat
it
is
a
common
occurrence
to
find
oneself
seated
on
the
pony
neck
or
else
landed
heavily
on
either
of
the
two
hard
wooden
arches
of
the
saddle

of
gracefully
falling
between
them
keeping
your
equilibrium
when
you
are
on
is
also
a
trying
exercise
to
anybody
not
born
and
bred
a
circus
rider
and
balancing
your
baggage
perfectly
on
each
side
of
the
saddle
is
somewhat
more
difficult
than
it

nine
miles
from

are

miles
from

built

put

hastily
makes

waits
for

then

tells
his

up
the

piratori
and
its
chief
a
large
number
of
ainu
have
taken
up
their
abode
on
the
banks
of
the
river
saru
or
sharu
as
it
is
called
by
them
and
piratori
nearly
fifteen
miles
from
the
coast
is
the
largest
village
of
the
whole
series
the
scenery
from
the
coast
to
this
village
is
not
grand
but
pretty
through
a
country
and
along
grassy
plains
the
ainu
give
to
the
plain
itself
the
name
of
which
corresponds
in
english
to
a
track
in
a
grassy
plain
along
this
or
not
far
from
it
one
meets
with
numerous
small
ainu
villages
and
scattered
huts
until
piratori
is
reached
piratori
is
a
string
or
succession
of
many
villages
on
undulating
ground
the
last
of
them
being
situated
on
a
high
cliff
overlooking
the
river
in
the
ainu
language
means
a
cliff
and
a
residence
as
in
all
ainu
villages
the
huts
are
in
one
line
some
few
yards
one
from
the
other
each
has
a
separate
structure
a
small
storehouse
built
on
piles
generally
at
the
west
end
of
the
hut
on
my
arrival
at
piratori
i
was
welcomed
by
benry
the
chief
of
the
village
who
invited
me
to
his
hut
and
me
in
the
most
solemn
manner
not
forgetting
to
mention
incidentally
that
his
throat
was
very
dry
and
that
japanese
wine
could
be
obtained
from
a
japanese
who
lives
opposite
to
his
hut
he
is
a
bad
man
said
benry
confidentially
but
he
sells
very
good
the
was
procured
and
benry
beaming
with
joy
poured
it
with
his
shaky
drunken
hands
into
a
large
bowl
he
then
produced
a
wooden
stick
shaped
like
a
about
five
inches
in
length
and
waved
it
in
the
air
five
or
six
times
with
his
right
hand
dipping
the
point
of
it
each
time
into
the
fluid
sir
master
said
he
then
leaning
forwards
and
lifting
up
his
heavy
moustache
with
the
small
stick
he
swallowed
the
contents
of
the
bowl
at
a
draught
the
same
performance
took
place
each
time
that
some
fresh
was
poured
into
his
bowl
and
then
benry
with
an
inimitable
cunning
and
a
comically
expression
on
his
face
meekly
enquired
whether
i
would
care
to
see
how
much
an
ainu
could
drink
yes
said
i
we
will
go
down
to
the
river
and
you
shall
show
me
there
if
you
can
drink
it
dry
yie
yie
yie
no
no
no
hurriedly
replied
in
japanese
the
ainu
chief
water
is
too
heavy
and
i
meant
wine
owing
to
this
small
difference
of
opinion
and
having
no
wish
to
encourage
him
in
his
drunkenness
benry
capacity
for
intoxicating
fluids
is
yet
unknown
to
the
civilised
world
benry
house
is
a
palace
compared
to
other
ainu
huts
it
is
much
larger
than
most
of
them
and
boasts
of
a
wooden
floor
in
the
centre
of
which
a
rectangular
is
cut
out
the
hut
has
two
windows
one
toward
the
east
the
other
opening
to
the
south
but
no
chimney
is
provided
as
an
outlet
for
the
smoke
a
hole
in
the
west
corner
of
the
roof
answers
this
purpose
the
rough
wooden
frame
is
thatched
with
tall
reeds
and
and
the
roof
is
shaped
like
a
prism
the
different
huts
of
piratori
vary
in
size
but
not
in
type
the
larger
ones
cover
an
area
of
about
sixteen
or
eighteen
feet
square
most
of
them
however
do
not
measure
more
than
ten
or
twelve
feet
square
benry
house
was
exceptionally
large
and
being
such
a
swell
one
two
rough
mats
were
spread
on
the
floor
and
a
number
of
japanese
rice
boxes
and
tables
adorned
one
side
of
the
dwelling
over
these
were
hung
a
number
of
swords
knives
most
of
them
with
no
blade
at
all
or
with
only
a
wooden
one
the
few
old
blades
which
benry
possessed
were
of
japanese
workmanship
probably
obtained
by
the
ainu
in
their
former
wars
with
the
japanese
a
few
ainu
spears
and
arrows
with
bone
and
bamboo
poisoned
points
were
fastened
to
the
roof
small
japanese
dinner
tables
these
ainu
of
piratori
have
frequent
intercourse
with
the
japanese
who
get
from
them
furs
and
other
articles
in
exchange
for
or
a
few
worthless
beads
a
few
are
also
found
at
piratori
the
piratori
ainu
with
those
of
volcano
bay
as
we
have
seen
are
those
best
known
to
the
civilised
world
as
a
few
foreigners
have
travelled
so
far
to
see
them
i
may
mention
that
as
types
the
inhabitants
of
piratori
are
a
great
deal
better
than
the
residents
of
volcano
bay
most
of
whom
are
but
even
they
themselves
can
not
be
taken
as
fair
specimens
of
their
race
for
they
have
adopted
several
customs
and
habits
of
the
japanese
which
the
incautious
traveller
has
then
reported
as
purely
ainu
customs
for
instance
the
pure
ainu
diet
consists
almost
entirely
of
fish
meat
and
seaweeds
only
occasionally
are
the
roots
of
certain
trees
eaten
at
piratori
i
found
that
many
grow
and
eat
millet
and
corn
and
bad
rice
are
also
sometimes
procured
from
the
japanese
benry
has
also
gone
so
far
in
the
way
of
civilisation
as
to
invest
his
small
fortune
in
buying
hens
and
a
cock
with
whom
he
shares
his
regal
home
these
hens
lay
eggs
according
to
custom
and
benry
and
his
wife
eat
them
as
the
ainu
language
has
no
special
word
for
this
imported
kind
of
bird

are
known
by
the
name

benry
the
ainu
chief
of
piratori
after
the
experience
which
i
had
had
at
horobets
i
decided
to
be
more
careful
with
my
sketching
i
broached
the
subject
to
benry
and
asked
him
to
sit
to
me
for
his
portrait
at
first
he
was
very
reluctant
but
the
prospect
of
receiving
a
present
finally
overcame
his
scruples
for
he
was
indeed
civilised
in
this
respect
and
understood
the
worth
of
his
version
of
the
almighty
dollar
to
perfection
and
consenting
to
be
sketched
he
sat
at
the
outset
with
as
much
courage
as
docility
he
produced
a
crown
of
shavings
and
seaweed
which
he
solemnly
placed
on
his
head
whilst
his
helped
him
on
with
his
regal
garments
as
well
as
a
large
sword
which
also
made
part
of
his
regal
insignia
the
crown
had
in
front
a
small
bear
head
roughly
carved
in
wood
and
the
clothes
were
very
gaudy
they
were
made
of
strips
of
blue
white
and
red
cloth
sewn
together
the
materials
used
were
japanese
but
they
were
cut
and
arranged
in
a
thoroughly
ainu
pattern
though
he
began
well
benry
was
not
a
good
sitter
and
like
most
animals
he
did
not
like
to
be
stared
at
he
felt
the
weight
of
a
look
as
it
were
and
it
made
him
uncomfortable
not
many
minutes
had
elapsed
before
he
became
openly
impatient
he
even
showed
his
temper
by
flinging
away
his
crown
and
his
wooden
sword
on
the
other
hand
sketching
in
benry
house
was
no
easy
matter
for
me
with
all
the
respect
due
to
the
chief
of
piratori
i
am
bound
to
say
that
his
house
was
not
a
model
of
cleanliness
those
of
his
hairy
brothers
and
subjects
were
no
better
than
his
and
many
were
a
great
deal
worse
fleas
and
other
insects
were
so
numerous
that
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
literally
covered
with
them
each
one
of
them
having
a
peaceful
and
hearty
meal
at
my
expense
while
i
for
the
sake
of
art
had
to
go
on
with
my
sketch
and
leave
them
undisturbed
notwithstanding
all
this
benry
was
immortalised
twice
that
day
and
his
maid
housekeeper
or
wife
three
words
which
have
the
same
meaning
to
the
ainu
was
also
handed
down
to
posterity
while
in
the
act
of
spinning
the
inner
fibre
of
the
bark
destined
to
form
a
new
garment
for
her
lord
master
and
husband
when
i
went
out
to
sketch
the
houses
and
storehouses
in
the
village
benry
and
another
man
followed
me
everywhere
but
neither
he
nor
his
seemed
to
take
any
interest
in
the
sketching
in
japan
corea
and
china
i
have
often
been
surrounded
by
hundreds
of
people
attentively
watching
every
stroke
of
the
brush
and
i
have
always
found
them
clever
and
quick
in
making
out
the
meaning
of
each
line
or
i
can
assert
without
fear
of
being
contradicted
that
the
majority
of
japanese
coreans
and
chinese
are
even
quicker
than
europeans
in
that
respect
owing
to
the
fact
that
lines
constitute
for
them
the
study
of
a
lifetime
chinese
characters
which
are
nothing
but
a
deep
study
of
lines
are
adopted
by
the
three
nations
and
i
consider
this
to
be
the
original
cause
why
this
artistic
insight
is
to
be
found
even
among
the
lowest
classes
the
ainu
have
no
such
insight
they
have
no
characters
no
writing
of
any
kind
no
books
and
it
is
therefore
not
astonishing
that
they
are
not
trained
to
understand
art
bad
as
it
may
have
been
in
my
case
their
appreciation
of
lines
is
yet
in
the
rudest
form
and
they
possess
no
more
than
what
is
instinctive
with
them
for
instance
while
i
was
sketching
benry
and
his
friend
either
sat
or
crouched
down
by
my
side
like
two
dogs
and
when
my
sketch
was
finished
i
showed
it
to
them
pirika
pirika
nishpa
very
pretty
very
pretty
sir
benry
exclaimed
with
perfect
but
when
i
asked
him
what
he
thought
the
sketch
represented
he
cut
me
short
by
saying
that
had
done
the
picture
and
ought
to
know
what
it
was
meant
for
he
did
not
his
friend
agreed
with
him
when
my
work
was
done
we
three
walked
back
to
benry
house
my
two
ainu
friends
being
very
anxious
that
i
should
get
something
to
eat
from
their
conversation
and
gestures
i
caught
that
it
seemed
incomprehensible
to
them
that
i
should
sit
in
front
of
an
ainu
hut
and
to
use
their
expression
make
all
sorts
of
signs
on
a
wooden
panel
after
a
lengthy
discussion
the
two
came
to
the
conclusion
that
houses
in
our
country
were
so
bad
that
i
had
been
sent
to
the
ainu
country
to
copy
the
pattern
of
ainu
huts
benry
seemed
excited
about
something
and
hurried
us
back
with
curious
haste
and
eagerness
when
we
left
the
house
in
the
morning
i
saw
placing
a
few
eggs
in
water
to
boil
over
the
fire
when
we
entered
the
hut
nearly
two
hours
afterwards
the
eggs
were
still
boiling
and
no
fair
maid
within
yelling
reach
in
order
that
the
fire
might
not
go
out
during
her
absence
the
thoughtful
girl
had
placed
the
largest
portion
of
the
trunk
of
a
tree
in
the
fireplace
taken
altogether
benry
and
all
his
saru
ainu
are
very
they
gradually
got
accustomed
to
being
sketched
seeing
that
after
all
it
really
did
not
bring
on
them
immediate
death
the
more
one
sees
of
the
ainu
the
dirtier
they
appear
but
as
dirt
to
a
great
extent
contributes
to
picturesqueness
i
was
indeed
sorry
when
benry
exercising
his
authority
sent
several
of
my
sitters
to
dress
up
in
their
best

often
japanese
while
i
should
have
preferred
to
sketch
them
in
their
rags
i
must
say
for
their
sake
that
they
were
never
sent
to
wash
being
a
rapid
sketcher
i
had
recourse
to
a
trick
i
pretended
to
sketch
one
given
person
who
of
course
was
sent
at
once
to
dress
up
and
while
he
or
she
after
having
returned
posed
patiently
for
half
an
hour
or
more
i
in
the
meantime
took
sketches
of
four
or
five
different
natives
who
were
not
aware
that
they
were
being
portrayed
as
the
ainu
and
they
are
probably
not
the
only
people
could
not
make
either
head
or
tail
of
my
sketches
my
trick
was
never
found
out
one
day
old
benry
led
me
by
the
hand
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
to
a
hut
some
way
off
and
confidentially
told
me
that
we
were
going
to
see
his
favourite
girl
and
her
boy
this
said
the
chief
triumphantly
as
we
went
in
this
is
pretty
girl
and
that
pointing
to
a
youth
her
only
son
and
what
about
the
old
hairy
lady
in
your
own
hut
i
inquired
that
is
my
great
wife
said
he
qualifying
matters
with
a
compliment
to
the
elder
woman
and
this
is
my
small
wife
why
should
you
have
two
wives
you
old
mormon
nishpa
retorted
he
my
great
wife
is
old
and
she
is
only
fit
to
do
all
the
rough
work
in
the
house
and
out
my
hair
is
white
but
i
am
strong
and
i
wanted
yet
a
young
wife
indeed
there
was
enough
in
benry
to
have
made
him
either
a
scamp
or
a
philosopher
his
theories
were
as
remarkable
as
they
were
accommodating
particularly
to
himself
returning
from
the
house
of
his
love
the
chief
was
in
a
very
talkative
mood
and
he
related
two
or
three
japanese
stories
which
he
wanted
me
to
believe
to
be
pure
ainu
legends
a
learned
missionary
and
two
or
three
travellers
before
him
who
had
visited
piratori
previous
to
myself
have
accepted
these
legends
wholesale
taking
word
for
their
accuracy
which
as
the
old
chief
speaks
very
good
japanese
of
course
simplified
the
task
of
understanding
and
transcribing
them
i
was
however
much
surprised
to
find
that
such
learned
europeans
could
yield
such
ready
credence
to
a
barbarian
ainu
chief
thinking
that
it
would
please
me
benry
told
me
the
story
of
a
deluge
and
a
big
flood
in
which
nearly
all
the
ainu
were
drowned
the
few
that
escaped
did
so
by
finding
refuge
on
a
high
mountain
where
did
you
learn
this
story
benry
i
asked
sternly
nishpa
it
is
an
old
ainu
story
and
all
strangers
who
come
to
piratori
write
it
in
their
books
oh
no
benry
you
know
well
that
stranger
did
not
write
it
in
his
book
said
i
quickly
as
if
i
knew
all
about
it
oh
yes
nishpa
was
the
stranger
who
told
me
the
story
this
small
anecdote
shows
how
careful
one
ought
to
be
in
accepting
information
which
may
sound
extremely
interesting
at
first
but
is
absolutely
worthless

the

and
no

time
of

is
fixed
for
them
as
it
so
happened
a
festival
a
iyomanrei
took
place
while
i
was
at
piratori
the
performance
was
held
in
a
large
hut
belonging
to
the
heir
apparent
to
the
chieftainship
of
piratori
i
went
to
the
hut
and
asked
whether
i
could
attend
the
performance
the
host
in
answer
came
to
meet
me
at
the
door
and
taking
me
by
the
hand
led
me
in
i
was
shown
where
to
sit
on
the
southern
side
of
the
hut
the
place
of
honour
for
strangers
and
my
host
sat
in
front
of
me
and
saluted
me
in
ainu
fashion
benry
and
several
old
men
were
squatting
on
the
floor
benry
in
the
middle
and
he
was
again
gorgeous
in
his
regal
clothes
some
of
the
others
who
wore
a
crown
like
benry
were
chiefs
of
the
neighbouring
villages
who
had
come
up
for
the
grand
occasion
one
by
one
all
the
men
present
rose
and
came
to
stroke
their
hair
and
beard
before
me
and
i
returned
the
compliment
as
well
as
i
could
in
ainu
fashion
the
hut
was
gradually
getting
filled
and
each
man
that
entered
first
saluted
the
landlord
then
benry
then
myself
and
ultimately
the
two
guests
between
whom
he
sat
women
and
children
occupied
the
darker
west
end
of
the
hut
and
they
took
no
active
part
in
the
function
other
chiefs
came
in
and
benry
was
surrounded
by
many
of
them
and
by
elderly
men
the
whole
group
of
these
chiefs
with
their
long
white
beards
lighted
up
by
a
brilliant
ray
of
sunshine
which
penetrated
through
the
small
east
window
was
extremely
picturesque
in
its
savagery
it
was
almost
grand
with
a
barbaric
sense
of
power
and
irresponsibility
in
truth
it
was
a
wonderful
sight
to
see
all
these
hairy
people
assembled
in
this
small
place
men
yet
not
men
like
ourselves
men
and
not
brutes
yet
still
having
curiously
brutish
traits
athwart
their
humanity
the
performance
was
simple
but
really
fine
in
its
simplicity
a
fire
burning
in
the
centre
of
the
hut
and
filling
the
place
with
smoke
added
by
its
suggestive
dimness
to
the
picturesqueness
of
the
scene
it
was
strange
that
the
only
ray
of
sun
which
came
in
should
fall
on
the
most
interesting
group
was
it
chance
or
design
rembrandt
himself
would
have
delighted
in
painting
that
scene
benry
looked
every
inch
a
king
and
several
of
the
younger
men
were
busily
engaged
lighting
his
pipe
and
refilling
it
with
tobacco
he
puffed
away
at
such
a
rate
that
no
sooner
was
the
pipe
filled
than
it
was
smoked
and
handed
over
again
to
undergo
the
same
process
two
large
casks
of
japanese
were
brought
in
and
each
man
produced
his
wooden
bowl
the
host
came
slowly
forward
and
planted
an
a
willow
wand
with
overhanging
shavings
in
one
corner
of
the
fireplace
then
muttered
a
few
words
which
implied
that
the
could
now
be
poured
out
a
japanese
lacquer
was
filled
with
the
intoxicating
liquid
and
no
sooner
had
this
been
done
than
old
benry
forgetting
his
dignity
jumped
up
and
made
a
rush
for
it
filled
a
large
bowl
and
retired
to
a
corner
to
drink
it
all
the
men
present
followed
his
example
benry
was
never
selfish
when
he
had
had
enough
for
himself
he
filled
his
bowl
again
and
brought
it
to
me
saying
that
i
was
a
friend
of
the
ainu
and
must
join
them
in
the
drinking
my
attention
was
suddenly
drawn
to
three
old
chiefs
who
half
drunk
stood
in
front
of
the
small
east
window
they
dipped
their
in
their
bowls
waving
them
towards
the
sun
as
a
salutation
to
the
chop
kamui
the
great
sun
there
was
no
religious
character
attached
to
this
libation
offered
to
the
sun
no
more
than
when
we
take
off
our
hats
passing
a
respected
friend
in
the
street
it
is
a
mere
sign
of
respect
not
of
worship
besides
it
must
be
clearly
understood
that
no
offerings
of
wine
are
ever
made
by
the
ainu
to
the
great
sun
and
that
the
libations
offered
are
invariably
consumed
by
the
offerer
i
managed
to
get
several
sketches
of
the
assembly
and
every
moment
i
expected
to
get
into
trouble
again
but
this
time
they
took
it
most
kindly
the
hut
became
very
stuffy
owing
to
the
large
number
of
persons
and
the
smoke
there
were
nearly
two
hundred
people
in
it
packed
closely
together
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
show
to
interest
one
certainly
not
the
disgusting
sight
of
this
drunkenness
which
moreover
became
monotonous
as
well
as
disgusting
i
stroked
my
hair
and
beard
the
latter
only
figuratively
in
sign
of
salute
to
the
host
benry
and
the
other
drowsy
chiefs
and
carefully
avoiding
pushing
or
treading
on
any
member
of
the
unsteady
crowd
i
made
my
exit
oh
what
a
treat
it
was
to
breathe
fresh
air
again
outside
the
hut
the
pretty
girls
of
piratori
were
having
a
lot
of
fun
all
to
themselves
they
were
all
dressed
in
long
yellowish
gowns
with
rough
white
and
red
ornamentations
on
a
patch
of
blue
cloth
on
their
backs
and
each
girl
took
a
very
active
part
in
a
game
or
a
kind
of
savage
dance
called
tapkara
they
all
ranged
themselves
in
a
circle
and
a
child
or
two
was
sometimes
placed
in
the
centre
the
game
consisted
in
collectively
hopping
an
indefinite
number
of
times
calling
out
either
the
name
or
the
accompanying
sound
of
some
of
their
everyday
occupations
and
clapping
the
hands
so
as
to
keep
time
for
instance
one
sound
was
ouye
ouye
fire
fire
and
they
all
blew
as
when
making
a
fire
and
hopped
till
they
were
nearly
senseless
then
the
next
was
and
with
this
they
imitated
the
pulling
of
a
rope
then
pirrero
pirrero

pirrero
was
the
sound
accompanying
the
action
of
rowing
imitating
the
squeaking
of
the
paddle
produced
by
the
friction
on
the
canoe
the
movement
of
the
arms
changed
according
to
the
sounds
uttered
but
the
hopping
was
kept
up
continuously
the
game
reminded
me
much
of
our
sir

de
coverley

a
more
barbarous
form

certainly
not
less

was
taken
to

valley
along

were
to

view
there
was
great
excitement
as
to
who
should
ride
the
ponies
the
ainu
are
fond
of
sports
and
i
noticed
that
ultimately
they
were
sharp
enough
to
select
their
jockeys
from
among
the
lightest
men
the
winner
of
each
race
had
a
good
time
of
it
but
the
other
unfortunate
jockeys
were
pulled
off
the
ponies
by
the
angry
mob
and
knocked
about
as
worthless
beings
the
evening
came
and
with
the
dying
sun
ended
that
memorable
day
of
festivities
i
retired
distant
sounds
of
the
still
enjoying
themselves
came
to
me
with
the
wind

fainter
and
fainter
they
grew
as
it
was
getting
darker

i
heard
again

at

the
sounds
faded
away
into

fell
asleep

morning
that
i
left

benry
put
on
his
regal
clothes

to

me

he
added
and
taking

he
pressed
it
to
his
hairy
chest
he
then
took
me
to
his
hut
again
and
there
renewed
his
farewells
and
i
renewed
mine
to
him
to
his
wife
and
to
his

it

heard
that

left

bowed

slowly
i
had
to
make

go
where
the
sand
was
wet
along
the
beach

there
it
was
harder

they
did
not

now
and
then
that
in
a
sheltered
nook
i
came
across
a
hut
or
two
of
seaweed
gatherers
and
still
following
the
cliffs
i
passed
two
or
three
small
villages
of
a
few
houses
each
after
fifteen
miles
of
this
heavy
track
i
reached
the
fishing
station
of
ubahu
where
i
was
able
to
obtain
some
fresh
horses
prowling
along
the
beach
i
examined
some
of
the
ainu
canoes
that
had
been
drawn
on
shore
they
might
be
divided
into
three
classes
the
used
mostly
for
river
navigation
the
lashed
canoe
and
a
larger
kind
used
for
sailing
the
does
not
require
explanation
as
everyone
knows
that
it
is
a
trunk
of
a
tree
hollowed
out
in
the
shape
of
a
boat
and
propelled
either
by
paddling
or
punting

oars
the
lashed
canoes
are
made
of
nine
pieces
of
wood
lashed
together
with
the
fibre
of
a
kind
of
vine
the
concave
bottom
is
all
of
one
piece
a
partial
to
which
are
added
the
side
pieces
of
three
planks
each
sewn
together
at
an
angle
of
about
and
made
to
fit
the
sides
of
the
two
more
pieces
one
aft
and
one
forward
meet
the
side
planks
at
right
angles
the
length
of
these
canoes
varies
from
to
feet
the
width
from
to
feet
two
pieces
of
wood
are
then
lashed
horizontally
which
answer
the
double
purpose
of
strengthening
the
sides
of
the
canoe
and
being
provided
with
pins
outside
the
canoe
of
allowing
it
to
be
used
as
an
outrigger
when
rowing
canoes
are
either
rowed
or
sailed
the
oars
are
made
of
two
pieces
firmly
lashed
together
a
hole
is
bored
in
the
part
which
is
to
be
passed
through
the
pin
in
the
outrigger
one
person
is
generally
sufficient
to
row
an
ainu
canoe
and
he
does
so
standing
there
is
no
steering
gear
or
rudder
and
when
rowing
the
oars
are
used
for
that
purpose
ainu
canoes
are
not
decked
and
therefore
can
not
stand
heavy
seas
they
are
alike
on
both
sides
and
in
most
cases
the
two
ends
of
the
canoe
are
also
shaped
alike
there
are
however
certain
canoes
which
in
my
opinion
have
been
suggested
to
the
ainu
by
japanese
boats
and
which
are
flat
at
the
stern
these
are
generally
larger
and
used
for
sailing
a
square
mat
sail
is
rigged
on
a
short
mast
forward
and
the
steering
is
done
with
one
of
the
oars
at
the
stern
the
sailing
qualities
of
these
canoes
however
are
not
very
great
and
the
slightest
squall
causes
them
to
capsize
and
turn
turtle
the
anchors
used
by
the
ainu
are
very
ingenious
they
are
cut
out
of
a
piece
of
wood
with
either
one
or
two
barbs
and
two
stones
are
fastened
on
the
sides
of
the
stem
so
as
to
carry
the
anchor
to
the
bottom
no
compass
is
either
known
or
used
by
the
ainu
and
the
natives
shape
their
course
by
sight
of
land
they
very
seldom
go
long
distances
out
at
sea
as
they
are
fully
aware
of
the
dangers
of
the
ocean
and
of
the
imperfection
of
their
own
methods
of
navigation
though
they
are
wholly
incapable
of
making
any
improvements
by
their
own
judgment
the
canoes
are
always
beached
when
not
used
and
each
family
possesses
its
own
there
are
none
which
are
the
property
of
companies
or
are
common
to
certain
villages

the
track
between
ubahu
and
urakawa
is
rough
and
the
rivers
are
somewhat
troublesome
not
far
from
the
mitsuashi
river
one
has
to
pass
a
tunnel
which
has
been
made
through
a
rock
projecting
into
the
sea
in
rough
weather
it
is
difficult
and
dangerous
to
get
through
as
the
waves
wash
right
through
the
tunnel
in
fair
weather
it
affords
a
safe
passage
to

the
winter
fishing
river
was
successfully
waded
and
the

village
passed
then
at

i
made
a
halt
for
the
night
there
are
many
at
urakawa
and
a
few
real

small

is
composed
mostly
of

made
by

on
to
lay

thick
seven
and
a
half
miles
further
at
a
corruption
of
stones
and
together
there
are
some
magnificent
granite
pillars
boldly
standing
out
of
the
sea
the
sandy
beach
came
to
an
end
and
huge
cliffs
barred
my
way
in
front
i
could
see
that
the
water
was
not
very
deep
round
these
rocks
as
the
waves
were
breaking
a
long
distance
from
the
cliff
a
sure
sign
of
shallow
water
though
even
then
it
might
have
been
too
deep
for
my
ponies
to
go
through
with
great
difficulty
i
got
the
two
brutes
into
the
sea
trying
to
round
the
large
rocks
for
the
better
ground
which
i
hoped
to
find
on
the
other
side
the
tide
was
low
but
the
sea
was
still
rough
and
nearly
every
wave
as
it
came
in
went
right
over
my
ponies
frightening
them
and
made
them
extremely
difficult
to
hold
the
instinct
of
made
them
rush
for
the
cliff
with
the
only
result
that
they
missed
their
footing
and
they
and
i
were
both
swept
away
by
the
next
receding
wave
i
was
carried
off
the
saddle
but
i
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
hold
on
to
the
bridle
an
awful
struggle
ensued
between
my
ponies
and
myself
each
wave
that
came
carried
and
knocked
us
one
way
each
wave
that
retired
carried
and
knocked
us
the
other
in
the
midst
of
all
this
danger
i
suddenly
remembered
that
some
years
ago
a
lady
who
knew
all
about
palmistry
prophesied
that
i
should
one
day
be
drowned
had
the
day
come
now
not
if
energy
and
perseverance
would
avert
the
doom
after
a
long
struggle
i
succeeded
in
pulling
my
horses
where
the
water
was
a
little
shallower
and
there
we
three
stood
for
some
minutes
trembling
with
cold
my
two
ponies
looking
reproachfully
at
me
with
those
eyes
of
animals
when
forced
into
positions
of
danger
which
they
can
neither
understand
nor
overcome
it
is
wonderful
the
amount
of
expression
that
horses
have
in
their
eyes
and
how
plainly
one
can
read
their
dumb
thoughts
and
formless
emotions
from
the
point
where
i
was
standing
i
could
see
that
i
had
to
go
on
but
a
few
hundred
feet
more
and
that
then
my
ponies
and
i
would
be
safe
sure
enough
the
water
grew
shallower
and
shallower
and
to
my
delight
i
was
soon
on
the
other
side
of
the
cliff
at
high
tide
and
in
very
rough
weather
it
is
impossible
to
pass
by
this
shamane
is
a
picturesque
little
fishing
village
built
on
the
side
of
a
promontory
jutting
out
into
the
sea
from
there
looking
towards
urakawa
there
is
a
lovely
view
of
all
the
small
islands
and
picturesque
rocks
standing
like
huge
jewels
in
the
water
while
on
the
horoizumi
side
as
far
as
the
eye
can
see
there
are
only
cliffs
of
peculiar
shapes
and
marvellously
rich
in
colour
i
got
two
fresh
animals
and
pursued
my
journey
towards
horoizumi
rocks
rocks
nothing
but
rocks
my
ponies
stumbled
and
slipped
all
the
time
and
for
eighteen
miles
the
riding
was
hard
and
intricate
i
had
to
lead
my
ponies
most
of
the
way
and
help
them
pull
them
or
push
them
from
one
rock
on
to
another
and
down
the
next
and
so
on
the
scenery
all
along
was
magnificent
and
grand
a
short
distance
from
shamane
a
large
natural
archway
emerges
from
the
sea
which
is
called
by
the
ainu
a
hole
in
stone
holes
have
been
pierced
through
the
rocks
in
several
places
to
give
comparative
safe
passage
and
to
prevent
wayfarers
from
being
carried
away
by
the
waves
over
the
entrance
of
one
of
these
tunnels
a
pretty
waterfall
descending
from
a
great
height
gives
a
poetic
effect
to
the
scene
while
it
obliges
the
unfortunate
traveller
to
take
an
extremely
cold
should
he
wish
to
push
forward
on
his
journey
as
if
all
these
discomforts
combined
were
not
enough
it
is
to
be
added
that
the
rivers
in
this
part
of
the
coast
though
not
wide
are
extremely
swift
and
dangerous
to
cross
my
second
pony
was
carried
away
by
the
strong
current
when
i
crossed
the
and
i
had
great
difficulty
in
rescuing
him

are
a
few

but
from
there
to

i
saw
none

very
plentiful

along
this

and

seaweeds
also
abound

latter

used
for
export

to

horoizumi
a
nice
little
village
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
houses
is
the
most
picturesque
in
yezo
it
is
built
on
the
slopes
of
a
high
cliff
and
it
reminds
one
much
of
the
pretty
villages
in
the
gulf
of
spezia
i
arrived
at
sunset
and
the
warm
red
and
yellow
tints
which
the
dying
orb
of
day
was
shedding
on
the
brownish
houses
gave
a
heavenly
appearance
to
this
very
earthly
place
as
i
got
nearer
a
good
deal
of
the
heavenly
had
to
be
discarded
for
the
odours
of
and
of
seaweed
are
two
smells
which
can
hardly
claim
to
be
classed
under
that
heading
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
themselves
seem
to
feel
the
of
constantly
living
in
that
corrupted
atmosphere
and
on
a
fish
and
seaweed
diet
for
indeed
it
is
revolting
to
see
the
amount
of
horrible
cutaneous
diseases
which
affect
them
one
hardly
sees
one
creature
out
of
ten
that
is
not
covered
with
a
repulsive
eruption
of
some
sort
leprosy
too
has
found
its
way
among
the
fishermen
and
my
readers
can
easily
imagine
how
pleasant
it
was
for
me
when
i
was
sketching
to
be
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
these
loathsome
people
who
all
wished
to
touch
my
clothes
and
all
my
belongings
and
who
would
even
lean
on
my
back
and
rub
their
heads
against
mine
when
trying
to
get
a
better
view
of
the
sketch
poor
things
i
never
had
the
courage
to
scold
and
send
them
away
it
was
enough
that
they
were
afflicted
and
i
did
not
like
to
add
humiliation
to
their
other
sorrows
by
showing
them
my
disgust
i
rode
on
to
or
rat
cape
thick
fogs
are
prevalent
during
the
summer
months
along
the
whole
of
the
coast
of
which
is
the
most
southern
cape
it
is
the
terminating
point
of
the
backbone
of
the
main
portion
of
yezo
which
extends
from
cape
soya
to
cape
erimo
from
to
a
lighthouse
has
lately
been
erected
on
the
cliffs
by
the
japanese
maritime
department
and
a
steam
has
also
been
provided
for
the
greater
safety
of
navigation
as
a
reef
of
rocks
and
a
stretch
of
shallow
water
extend
out
in
the
sea
for
about
two
and
a
half
miles
from
the
coast
the
foghorn
i
was
informed
was
only
blown
when
the
suspected
some
ship
was
likely
to
make
for
the
rocks
a
likely
thing
indeed
but
how
are
you
to
know
especially
when
there
is
a
thick
fog
on
i
asked
so
few
ships
pass
near
here
was
the
reply
and
it
would
not
be
much
use
keeping
steam
up
all
the
time
to
blow
the
horn
considering
that
we
have
fog
during
nearly
four
months
in
the
year
then
i
could
not
help
remarking
i
expect
you
only
light
the
lighthouse
when
there
is
going
to
be
a
wreck
oh
no
we
show
the
light
every
night
this
was
just
like
the
japanese
owing
to
the
imperfectness
of
charts
none
delineating
correctly
that
part
of
the
coast
the
strong
currents
the
thick
fogs
and
the
dangerous
reefs
there
could
not
be
a
more
perilous
coast
for
navigation
than
that
which
terminates
in
cape
erimo
the
ships
which
go
from
shanghai
or
some
of
the
ports
in
the
petchili
gulf
in
china
to
north
american
ports
often
steer
this
course
through
the
tsugaru
strait
and
pass
directly
south
of
cape
erimo

the
an
english
while
on
her
journey
from
shanghai
to

was
lost

nearly

on
board
about
two
miles
from
this
cape
at
the
foot
of
the
erimo
cliffs
is
a
small
fishing
village
called
okos
the
sea
is
shallow
at
this
place
and
there
are
many
reefs
which
afford
abundance
of
kelp
and
seaweeds
a
short
time
before
i
arrived
at
okos
a
man
had
gone
out
in
his
boat
to
save
some
nets
in
which
a
large
fish
had
got
entangled
his
boat
capsized
and
he
was
drowned
his
wife
was
in
a
dreadful
state
of
mind
not
for
the
loss
of
her
better
half
but
for
the
more
irreparable
loss
of
the
nets
the
distance
between
horoizumi
and
cape
erimo
is
seven
and
a
half
miles
and
the
track
is
exceedingly
rough
in
many
places
nearly
between
the
village
and
the
cape
are
the
three
high
pillars
called
which
are
represented
in
the
illustration
at
the

of

as
it
was
impossible
to
take
my
ponies
along
the
few
miles
between
cape
erimo
and
shoya
following
the
precipitous
coast
i
retraced
my
steps

the
mountain
pass
between
horoizumi
and
shoya
is
supposed
to
be
very
dangerous
on
account
of
bears
i
rode
the
ten
miles
quietly
but
failed
to
meet
or
see
any
the
way
through
thick
woods

exceedingly
pretty
after
traversing
a
small
valley
with
a
dense
growth
of
it
climbs
a
small
hill
from
the
top
of
which
a
lovely
view
of
cape
erimo
lies
like
a
picture
before
one
eyes
there
are
only
thirty
houses
at
shoya
and
the
place
could
not
be
better
described
than
by
the
words
a
miserable
hole
the
rough
weather
as
well
as
several
landslips
had
some
time
before
my
arrival
broken
all
communication
between
shoya
and
the
next
village
east
of
it
there
is
a
rough
mountain
trail
as
far
as
saruru
but
my
ponies
could
not
possibly
get
through
the
and
heavy
climbing
and
none
of
the
natives
could
be
induced
to
carry
my
luggage
they
all
positively
refused
to
follow
me
on
account
of
the
multitude
of
bears
which
they
said
were
on
the
mountains
if
the
sea
goes
down
said
an
old
fisherman
you
may
be
able
to
get
through
early
morning
at
low
tide
and
if
you
are
careful
you
will
not
be
washed
away
by
the
waves
the
cliffs
near
shoya
are
remarkable
for
their
beauty
they
are
mostly
older
eruptive
rocks
which
nature
has
carved
into
hundreds
of
rugged
and
fantastic
forms
about
a
mile
from
the
village
is
a
huge
natural
archway
and
from
this
point
begin
the
precipitous
cliffs
pillars
and
rocks
which
make
the
journey
so
difficult
at
shoya
there
are
no
pure
ainu
but
some
of
the
fishermen
exhibit
traces
of
ainu
blood
my
recollection
of
shoya
is
decidedly
not
of
a
pleasant
character
i
put
up
in
the
house
of
a
fisherman
which
also
answers
the
purpose
of
a
for
the
few
stranded
native
travellers
we
are
so
poor
said
the
landlord
when
i
asked
for
something
to
eat
and
we
have
finished
our
provisions
of
rice
the
other
people
in
the
village
are
poorer
than
we
are
and
they
also
have
none
and
as
for
fish
the
sea
has
been
so
rough
for
several
days
that
we
have
not
been
able
to
catch
any
we
ate
the
last
scrap
of
fish
we
had
just
before
you
arrived
if
you
gave
me
a
fortune
i
could
not
give
you
anything
to
eat
when
the
landlord
confessed
this
to
me
in
the
evening
i
had
already
been
fourteen
hours
without
food
the
prospect
of
not
getting
any
more
for
at
least
the
next
eighteen
or
twenty
hours
was
not
an
agreeable
i
was
very
hungry
but
failing
a
meal
the
next
best
thing
was
to
try
and
go
to
sleep
even
that
did
not
prove
successful
for
hunger
keeps
you
awake
and
in
its
first
stages
sharpens
all
your
senses
considerably
the
night
i
spent
at
shoya
is
worthy
of
a
description
from
top
to
bottom
the
corners
of
my
room
were
filled
with
webs
which
the
spiders
had
spun
undisturbed
in
all
directions
across
the
room
hundreds
of
flies
and
horseflies
rose
buzzing
when
i
entered
the
room
and
i
had
to
engage
in
a
very
unequal
war
against
them
before
i
could
settle
down
on
the
hard
planks
in
one
corner
of
the
ceiling
a
big
spider
too
high
for
me
to
reach
was
enjoying
a
good
meal
out
of
a
huge
horsefly
which
he
had
captured
in
his
net
i
almost
envied
the
epicure
nature
will
be
ironical
sometimes
when
night
came
and
i
was
still
sleepless
the
planks
on
which
i
was
lying
seemed
harder
than
any
planks
i
had
ever
slept
on
before
i
turned
round
one
way
then
the
other
then
another
till
all
my
bones
were
aching
finally
through
exhaustion
i
fell
asleep
and
even
had
a
nightmare
in
my
dreams
the
ghosts
of
all
the
spiders
i
had
killed
magnified
to
the
size
of
human
beings
were
dancing
round
me
while
one
fat
old
fellow
fatter
than
any
two
others
put
together
was
gravely
sitting
on
my
chest
watching
the
performance
his
weight
was
such
that
i
was
nearly
suffocated
sometimes
he
would
seize
me
by
the
throat
and
almost
choke
me
while
the
dancing
spiders
would
choke
themselves
with
laughing
when
danna
quick
sir
said
a
japanese
voice
waking
me
suddenly
get
up
or
else
the
tide
will
rise
and
you
will
not
be
able
to
get
to
saruru
i
opened
my
eyes
the
dream
passed
and
the
monstrous
spiders
vanished
but
the
pain
caused
by
the
emptiness
of
my
stomach
was
still
there
and
my
throat
was
dry
and
aching
it
was
before
sunrise
and
it
was
almost
in
complete
darkness
that
i
left
shoya
i
was
weak
and
chilly
the
monotonous
sound
of
the
waves
breaking
over
the
shore
added
melancholy
to
and
made
me
very
doleful
and
limp
nevertheless
as
i
was
in
for
it
i
pushed
my
way
with
my
ponies
along
high
cliffs
and
among
rocks
and
got
on
as
best
i
could
where
the
sea
had
receded
the
stones
were
slippery
and
my
two
animals
were
no
sooner
on
their
feet
than
they
were
down
again
on
their
knees
the
hollow
sound
of
their
hoofs
on
the
rocks
was
echoed
from
cliff
to
cliff
and
awakened
the
sleepy
crows
from
their
night
repose
i
had
to
walk
most
of
the
way
and
urge
on
my
ponies
with
howls
as
well
as
stir
them
up
with
the
whip
though
the
tide
was
low
the
waves
often
washed
up
to
my
waist
daylight
came
and
i
went
along
following
the
high
rugged
cliffs
through
tunnels
occasionally
among
rocks
continually
the
scenery
was
really
magnificent
seen
as
it
was
in
the
mysterious
morning
light
of
the
rising
sun
my
horses
were
done
up
when
i
got
to
saruru
and
i
exchanged
them
for
fresh
ones
by
this
time
the
tide
had
risen
and
it
was
not
possible
to
proceed
any
further
along
the
i
was
glad
of
it
as
i
should
thus
be
forced
to
try
the
mountain
track
which
i
was
told
was
not
so
very
rough
from
this
point
a
offered
to
show
me
the
way
it
was
a
very
stiff
climb
among
thick
shrub
but
it
was
comparatively
smooth
work
after
the
experience
of
my
journey
from
shoya
i
came
across
many
tracks
and
footprints
of
bears
on
the
mountain
in
some
places
the
marks
were
quite
fresh
and
of
different
sizes
varying
in
length
from
one
foot
to
four
inches
the
told
me
that
black
bears
seldom
attack
men
unless
they
are
hungry
they
often
attack
horses
but
if
they
hear
that
a
man
is
near
they
will
not
dare
to
attack
even
the
horses
he
said
and
then
began
to
sing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
his
singing
half
japanese
half
ainu
was
so
excruciating
that
it
was
no
wonder
to
me
that
it
kept
the
bears
away
we
crossed
two
rapid
streams
before
reaching
the
summit
of
the
mountain
range
the
view
from
the
summit
was
lovely
in
the
distance
i
could
distinguish
two
headlands
while
an
immense
stretch
of
stormy
sea
and
a
high
mountain
were
in
the
foreground
i
began
to
descend
and
again
i
got
into
the
region
of
thick
forest
and
scrub
i
perceived
a
few
houses
near
the
coast
and
we
made
for
them
it
was
the
village
of
moyoro
or
biru
as
it
is
called
by
others
moyoro
a
bay
to
be
in
between
saruru
and
biru
where
the
mountain
track
sometimes
descends
to
the
shore
i
found
many
ainu
and
especially
in
the
two
villages
of
onnito
and
bitatannuki
they
are
said
to
be
very
bad
and
what
i
saw
of
them
even
at
biru
corroborated
this
assertion
onnito
or
great
large
lake

bitatannuki
to
undo

biru
is
situated
on
a
small
bay
in
the
centre
of
which
some
gigantic
pillars
stand
out
at
a
great
height
the
rough
sea
dashes
against
them
and
thousands
of
crows
and
have
chosen
these
rocks
for
their
abode
biru
is
not
a
large
village
there
are
only
forty
huts
most
of
which
are
on
the
high
cliff
surrounding
the
small
bay
the
others
are
down
on
the
beach
kelp
seaweed
and
sardines
are
as
abundant
here
as
on
the
coast
and
maintain
the
staple
industries
of
the
inhabitants
the
is
of
great
length
but
small
width
fourteen
more
miles
over
the
cliffs
brought
me
to
perohune
there
were
four
large
deltas
to
cross
that

the

the
largest

all
these

river
perohune

a
big
name
but
there
is
only
one
house
in
the
place
i
was
however
fortunate
enough
to
get
two
good
ponies
there
the
fog
was
settling
down
thicker
and
thicker
and
i
could
not
see
more
than
a
yard
or
two
in
front
of
me
but
at
times
it
lifted
up
for
a
few
moments
and
showed
me
either
the
dangers
i
was
nearing
or
the
landscape
i
was
losing
i
passed
two
lakes
the
tobuts
otherwise
called
oputs
and
the
yuto
both
are
divided
from
the
sea
by
a
narrow
there
is
but
little
of
human
interest
along
this
deserted
coast
there
are
no
houses
and
no
people
but
many
small
rivers
and
now
and
then
high
cliffs
my
ponies
driven
mad
by
the
the
terrible
horseflies
of
yezo
constantly
threw
themselves
down
and
rolled
on
the
sand
lake
swamp
mouth
of
a
river
a
meaningless
prefix
mouth
of
a
river
from
perohune
to
yuto
lake
the
distance
is
about
eleven
miles
and
from
yuto
to
otsu
it
is
eleven
more
miles
on
a
very
easy
track
i
saw
some
large
and
penguins
and
i
was
struck
by
the
great
number
of
drift
logs
which
had
been
washed
on
shore
by
the
sea
the
last
miles
of
the
coast
was
literally
covered
with
this
drift
wood
during
the
summer
months
the
fog
is
always
dense
along
this
coast
greatly
owing
to
a
cold
current
which
comes
from
the
otkoshk
sea
passes
through
the
strait
between
kunashiri
and
etorofu
in
the
kuriles
and
then
turns
south
following
a
great
part
of
the
coast
of
yezo
not
far
from
erimo
cape
it
meets
a
warm
current
from
the
china
sea
which
passes
through
the
tsugaru
strait
and
which
in
all
probability
is
the
or
japan
current
this

from
the

near
the

of

goes
through
the

and
follows
the
coast
of
nippon
passing
then
through
the
tsugaru
strait
as
will
be
seen
later
a

of
this

tokachi
river
chapter
vii
the
tokachi
region
pure
ainu
types
curious
mode
of
river
fishing
the
tokachi
river
is
one
of
the
largest
and
most
important
in
yezo
knowing
that
the
ainu
either
settle
on
the
or
up
i
formed
an
idea
that
some
good
types
were
to
be
found
up
this
river
on
reaching
otsu
a
small
settlement
at
the
mouth
of
the
otsugawa
a
branch
of
the
large
delta
formed
by
the
tokachi
my
idea
was
confirmed
by
the
report
that
there
were
no
japanese
villages
in
the
interior
the
expedition
up
the
tokachi
river
was
by
no
means
easy
from
the
accounts
i
heard
at
otsu
none
of
the
japanese
ever
dare
to
penetrate
into
the
interior
from
otsu
and
so
far
as
foreigners
are
concerned
the
tokachi
river
was
utterly
unexplored
there
is
a
certain
charm
in
being
the
first
man
to
do
something
and
i
decided
to
attempt
the
experiment
the
japanese
of
otsu
dissuaded
me
strongly
from
carrying
out
my
plan
for
they
said
the
grass
and
reeds
were
so
high
that
i
could
not
possibly
get
through
it
is
a
kind
of
a
jungle
in
fact
said
they
in
which
yellow
and
black
bears
are
plentiful
the
rivers
which
are
numerous
are
swollen
by
the
heavy
rains
that
have
fallen
lately
the
natives
up
the
river
are
unsociable
and
bad
and
they
will
kill
you
then
in
the
high
grass
and
mosquitoes
abound
if
you
attempt
it
alone
said
the
wise
man
of
the
party
you
will
not
come
back
alive
these
reports
were
not
encouraging
but
anyhow
i
determined
that
irish
as
it
may
sound
or
if
there
were
any
ainu
up
the
stream
i
would
see
them
owing
to
the
difficulty
of
taking
even
my
usual
baggage
and
not
wishing
to
burden
my
ponies
with
more
than
was
necessary
i
decided
to
carry
with
me
only
a
many
wooden
sketching
panels
my
diary
and
my
revolver
i
left
all
my
other
things
at
otsu
to
wait
for
my
return
should
you
not
come
back
again
can
i
keep
all
your
belongings
as
my
property
kindly
enquired
the
landlord
of
the
when
i
bade
to
him
and
to
all
the
villagers
who
had
collected
round
early
in
the
morning
to
see
me
start
i
took
two
ponies
as
usual
i
left
otsu
at
dawn
and
followed
as
well
as
i
could
the
winding
course
of
the
river
not
far
from
otsu
i
came
to
the
thick
jungle
of
high
reeds
and
tall
grass
of
which
i
had
already
heard
i
made
my
way
through
the
first
obstructions
but
i
had
not
been
in
the
jungle
more
than
a
few
minutes
when
i
was
simply
devoured
by
mosquitoes
and
my
ponies
were
kicking
bucking
and
trying
to
bolt
as
they
also
were
literally
covered
with
sucking
their
blood
and
stinging
them
to
madness
the
reeds
and
grass
were
about
ten
or
twelve
feet
high
so
that
being
higher
than
myself
on
my
horse
i
could
not
see
where
i
was
going
i
kept
along
the
river
bank
as
much
as
i
could
but
in
many
places
it
was
difficult
to
get
through
the
ravines
which
one
invariably
finds
along
rivers
so
i
kept
a
little
way
off
on
the
west
side
and
had
the
noise
of
the
running
river
to
guide
me
for
many
wearisome
hours
i
rode
through
this
jungle
the
dividing
reeds
continually
rubbing
against
my
face
arms
and
legs
sometimes
making
pretty
deep
cuts
with
their
long
leaves
the
huge
the
grew
more
and
more
tiresome
as
the
sun
got
warmer
and
my
head
and
hands
were
swollen
and
bleeding
the
sun
was
by
this
time
high
in
the
sky
but
there
were
no
signs
of
the
jungle
coming
to
an
end
no
indications
of
huts
anywhere
near
no
other
noise
but
the
sound
of
the
crashing
reeds
and
the
running
water
of
the
river
my
ponies
were
feeding
well
as
grass
was
plentiful
but
i
was
faring
badly
what
with
the
exertion
of
keeping
the
ponies
in
order
while
the
reeds
nearly
dragged
me
off
the
saddle
what
with
the
plague
of
mosquitoes
and
added
to
the
sense
of
weakness
caused
by
fatigue
and
hunger
it
was
really
a
terrible
time
for
me
one
of
the
worst
episodes
in
my
life
nevertheless
i
persevered
and
went
on
and
on
determined
to
reach
my
destination
i
came
upon
two
very
large
swamps
which
forced
me
to
make
a
wide
the
ponies
were
very
tired
and
so
was
i
when
darkness
set
in
i
halted
took
the
heavy
off
the
ponies
and
tied
the
animals
to
them
so
that
they
could
not
bolt
during
the
night
and
wearied
disheartened
and
discouraged
as
i
was
i
began
to
think
how
stupid
i
had
been
to
start
on
such
an
expedition
without
carrying
any
provisions
with
me
without
having
provided
myself
with
even
a
tent
or
a
covering
of
any
kind
circumstances
made
me
a
philosopher
what
is
the
use
of
worrying
about
things
that
can
not
be
helped
after
all
when
you
get
accustomed
to
it
starving
is
really
not
so
bad
as
people
think
one
of
my
ponies
was
of
a
sentimental
disposition
and
he
seemed
to
understand
my
troubles
he
came
close
and
rubbed
himself
against
me
placing
his
head
near
mine
it
was
touching
and
in
the
solitude
in
which
i
was
the
sympathy
of
the
dumb
beast
was
as
precious
as
that
of
a
human
being
had
he
been
able
to
speak
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
christian
and
a
good
one
too
he
had
been
fearfully
stung
by
and
my
petting
him
seemed
to
alleviate
his
pain
there
is
nothing
like
sympathy
and
a
little
personal
kindness
if
one
wants
to
make
friends
with
animals
the
last
few
rays
of
light
were
spent
in
putting
together
the
notes
which
i
had
taken
during
the
day
and
which
enabled
me
to
draw
a
of
the
river
at
horoizumi
some
days
previously
i
was
able
to
buy
myself
a
compass
from
a
japanese
fisherman
and
on
this
occasion
it
was
extremely
useful
to
me
by
the
soft
or
rather
shrill
music
of
a
full
orchestra
of
mosquitoes
i
fell
asleep
it
was
poetic
but
not
comfortable
strange
noises
woke
me
several
times
during
the
night
my
ponies
also
were
very
restless
and
repeatedly
tried
to
get
loose
while
i
was
lying
down
on
the
two
saddles
to
which
they
were
fastened
it
was
some
time
after
sunrise
when
i
woke
up
and
with
stiff
bones
set
off
again
a
heavy
dew
had
fallen
during
the
night
and
had
made
my
clothes
very
damp
the
reeds
and
grass
also
were
saturated
with
water
and
riding
through
them
caused
a
continuous
shower
to
fall
over
me
giving
me
an
uncomfortable
and
by
no
means
efficient
kind
of
shower
bath
i
rode
in
a
westerly
direction
till
about
two
or
three
in
the
afternoon
when
suddenly
the
jungle
came
to
an
end
not
only
that
but
a
short
distance
away
i
saw
some
ainu
huts
i
soon
reached
them
dismounted
and
tied
my
ponies
to
a
tree
i
went
to
the
first
hut
and
previous
to
going
in
i
called
out
hem
hem
hem
hem
which
in
the
ainu
country
is
the
polite
preliminary
when
a
stranger
wishes
to
enter
a
hut
the
usual
practice
of
at
the
door
is
dispensed
with
for
ainu
doorways
have
no
doors
hem
hem
hem
hem
hem
called
i
again
much
louder
but
i
heard
no
answer
so
i
lifted
the
mat
and
entered
the
hut
it
was
empty
no
one
was
there
i
came
out
again
and
went
into
the
next
hut
into
another
and
yet
another
but
nobody
was
to
be
found
i
supposed
that
they
were
all
out
fishing
from
the
roof
in
each
hut
was
hanging
some
dried
and
salmon
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
after
nearly
hours
of
involuntary
fasting
and
i
stole
i
mean
conveyed
or
helped
myself
to
the
largest
fish
i
was
greedily
eating
it
and
how
good
it
was
when
i
thought
i
heard
a
groan
inside
the
hut
i
listened
and
i
distinctly
heard
some
one
sniffing
in
a
corner
of
the
dark
dwelling
had
i
been
caught
stealing
the
crime
i
had
committed
would
be
called
felony
at
home
but
in
the
ainu
country
it
has
not
nearly
so
bad
a
name
as
that
however
felony
or
not
i
dropped
the
fish
or
rather
what
remained
of
it
and
made
for
the
corner
whence
the
noise
came
as
i
got
closer
i
discerned
a
mass
of
white
hair
and
two
claws
almost
like
thin
human
feet
with
long
hooked
nails
a
few
scattered
on
the
ground
and
a
lot
of
filth
were
massed
together
in
that
corner
and
the
disgusting
odours
these
exhaled
were
beyond
measure
horrible
what
the
devil
is
that
i
said
aloud
in
my
own
native
tongue
i
could
hear
someone
breathing
heavily
under
that
mass
of
white
hair
but
i
could
not
make
out
the
shape
of
a
human
body
i
touched
the
hair
i
pulled
it
and
with
a
groan
and
movements
similar
to
those
of
a
snake
uncoiling
itself
two
thin
bony
arms
suddenly
stretched
out
and
clasped
my
hand
as
my
eyes
were
getting
accustomed
to
the
dim
light
i
thought
i
saw
some
almost
tattoo
marks
on
her
arms
yes
it
was
a
woman
in
that
corner
though
her
limbs
were
merely
skin
and
bone
and
her
long
hair
and
long
nails
gave
her
a
ghastly
appearance
indeed
crouched
as
she
was
doubled
up
with
her
head
on
her
knees
and
the
long
hair
falling
over
her
face
and
shoulders
it
was
really
difficult
to
make
out
what
she
was
i
asked
her
to
come
out
but
she
was
apparently
deaf
and
dumb
i
dragged
her
out
and
she
made
but
little
resistance
only
she
preferred
crawling
on
her
hands
and
knees
to
walking
upright
on
her
feet
there
is
no
accounting
for
people
tastes
and
i
let
her
please
herself
in
her
manner
of
locomotion
when
she
was
fairly
out
in
the
light
i
shivered
as
i
looked
at
the
miserable
being
before
me
i
lifted
up
her
hair
to
see
the
face
her
eyebrows
were
thick
and
shaggy
and
were
joined
over
the
nose
her
eyes
were
half
closed
and
the
strong
light
seemed
to
affect
her
and
with
her
hands
she
was
feeling
the
ground
probably
in
order
to
retrace
her
steps
back
to
the
dark
spot
nature
could
not
have
inflicted
more
evils
on
that
wretched
creature
she
was
nearly
blind
deaf
and
dumb
she
apparently
suffered
from
rheumatism
which
had
doubled
up
her
body
and
stiffened
her
bony
arms
and
legs
and
moreover
she
showed
many
of
the
symptoms
of
leprosy
altogether
she
was
painful
horrible
disgusting
and
humiliating
to
contemplate
i
went
back
to
my
ponies
to
fetch
my
during
my
absence
there
had
collected
round
them
ainu
they
did
not
know
what
to
think
of
the
appearance
of
the
two
animals
and
the
few
articles
fastened
to
the
were
regarded
with
suspicion
when
i
appeared
on
the
scene
their
astonishment
was
even
greater
and
it
reached
its
climax
when
i
saluted
them
in
the
ainu
fashion
and
told
them
that
i
was
a
friend
of
the
ainu
i
unfastened
my
and
went
back
to
the
old
woman
she
was
still
where
i
had
left
her
all
the
ainu
present
followed
me
and
when
i
squatted
down
they
did
the
same
in
a
semicircle
round
me
my
wretched
model
attempted
several
times
to
crawl
inside
the
hut
but
as
i
was
sitting
close
to
her
i
prevented
her
from
doing
so
there
she
sat
in
the
most
extraordinary
position
with
her
head
resting
on
her
left
hand
and
the
stiff
fingers
of
her
right
hand
pressed
on
the
ground
one
leg
was
bent
up
and
the
other
was
folded
resting
on
the
ground
and
on
the
foot
of
the
first
she
was
sniffing
the
wind
and
making
efforts
to
see
with
her
eyes
illustration
madwoman
of
yammakka
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
that
i
did
not
keep
my
model
longer
than
was
strictly
necessary
and
when
the
sketch
was
finished
i
took
her
by
the
arm
brought
her
back
into
the
hut
and
led
her
to
her
favourite
corner
there
she
crouched
herself
again
as
i
had
found
her
and
there
i
left
her
to
bear
the
miseries
of
her
life
till
death
the
cure
of
all
woes
shall
take
away
her
soul
if
not
her
body
from
the
filth
she
had
lived
in
she
was
neither
nor
taken
care
of
by
the
villagers
or
by
her
son
who
lived
in
the
same
hut
but
she
was
regarded
as
a
worthless
object
and
treated
accordingly
a
fish
was
occasionally
flung
to
her
as
one
would
to
a
beast
and
in
such
a
condition
this
human
being
had
lived
or
rather
existed
apparently
for
several
years
not
a
word
was
uttered
by
the
villagers
during
the
few
minutes
i
took
to
paint
the
sketch
i
turned
round
to
inspect
my
new
friends
others
had
come
up
and
these
men
and
women
hairy
and
partly
naked
squatting
down
amidst
filth
and
driven
half
mad
by
the
and
looked
just
like
a
large
family
of
restless
monkeys
they
were
gentle
and
kind
much
more
so
than
any
of
their
more
civilised
brethren
and
one
of
them
a
fine
old
man
came
forward
when
i
came
out
of
the
hut
and
wished
me
to
go
and
see
a
big
yellow
bear
they
had
captured
i
went
and
near
the
man
hut
in
a
rough
square
cage
made
of
crossed
branches
of
trees
was
bruin
grinding
his
teeth
as
we
drew
near
in
a
monotone
the
man
told
me
the
story
of
the
hunt
and
how
the
bear
had
been
captured
then
we
went
from
one
hut
to
another
all
through
the
village
yamakubiro
is
the
name
given
to
the
huts
taken
collectively
but
the
man
took
good
care
to
explain
to
me
that
one
part
of
the
village
numbering
only
seven
houses
was
called
tchiota
and
the
other
a
short
distance
away
was
named
yammakka
tchiota
in
the
ainu
language
means
and
yammakka
is
land
in
behind
yammakka
has
ten
huts
the
hut
in
which
i
had
to
put
up
was
more
than
filthy
and
i
had
a
sort
of
presentiment
that
my
landlord
was
a
scoundrel
he
saw
me
giving
a
small
silver
japanese
coin
to
a
girl
i
had
painted
from
that
moment
i
noticed
his
eyes
were
continually
fixed
on
my
waistcoat
pocket
out
of
which
i
had
taken
the
coin
however
i
did
not
think
much
of
that
as
all
ainu
are
fond
of
beads
metals
or
anything
that
shines
when
the
evening
came
i
tried
to
go
to
sleep
on
the
hard
planks
as
usual
there
is
undoubtedly
more
than
about
ainu
accommodation
myriads
of
taikkis
the
tiny
but
troublesome
and
uninvited
guests
of
all
dirty
dwellings
did
me
the
honour
to
sup
off
the
few
drops
of
blood
which
remained
in
my
veins
i
owed
it
to
a
bottle
of
keating
powder
that
i
was
not
carried
away
bodily
by
them
i
felt
cold
and
feverish
and
having
no
civilised
to
cover
me
i
slept
with
my
clothes
on
and
this
the
more
willingly
as
i
felt
an
instinctive
mistrust
of
my
host
and
i
thought
it
was
as
well
to
be
ready
for
any
emergency
a
few
salmon
were
hanging
right
over
my
nose
they
hung
low
but
they
smelt
high
i
had
been
given
a
place
in
the
corner
of
the
hut
and
my
landlord
retired
to
the
corner
though
this
may
sound
very
far
my
host
was
really
not
more
than
a
few
feet
away
from
me
he
apparently
thought
that
i
had
gone
to
sleep
for
i
heard
him
creep
to
my
side
i
could
not
see
him
being
in
absolute
darkness
but
though
he
was
evidently
holding
his
breath
i
could
feel
the
warmth
of
his
face
near
mine
he
was
listening
to
hear
if
i
were
asleep
i
kept
quiet
and
pretended
to
snore
this
gave
him
courage
and
sliding
his
hand
gently
along
my
arm
he
came
to
a
pocket
in
my
coat
he
began
to
explore
it
but
the
ainu
are
an
unfortunate
people
even
when
they
try
to
steal
he
had
got
hold
of
a
pocket
with
no
bottom
to
it
a
common
occurrence
in
my
coats
the
more
he
explored
the
more
he
found
there
was
to
explore
i
am
fond
myself
of
explorations
and
i
have
no
objection
to
a
hairy
or
not
hairy
prospecting
my
empty
pockets
or
my
pockets
which
have
no
bottom
to
them
however
my
host
was
not
satisfied
with
the
first
results
of
his
researches
and
with
his
hand
still
through
the
torn
lining
of
the
proceeded
to
investigate
the
contents
of
my
waistcoat
pockets
this
was
a
different
matter
altogether
and
catching
hold
of
him
before
he
was
able
to
disentangle
himself
i
swung
his
arm
away
and
hit
him
hard
on
the
head
with
my
right
fist
wooi
cried
he
in
despair
and
half
stunned
as
he
scrambled
away
as
best
he
could
to
his
corner
by
way
of
apology
and
excuse
and
with
a
trembling
voice
the
man
from
his
corner
said
that
he
had
only
come
to
sleep
on
my
side
of
the
hut
as
the
wind
was
blowing
strong
where
he
had
lain
down
and
that
my
side
was
warmer
a
good
excuse
indeed
when
you
are
caught
pickpocketing
the
salmon
which
my
host
gave
me
last
night
for
dinner
and
this
morning
for
breakfast
was
so
rotten
that
hungry
as
i
was
i
could
not
eat
it
from
yammakka
in
a
westerly
direction
the
way
begins
with
a
gentle
incline
therefore
there
is
a
complete
absence
of
the
high
and
troublesome
reeds
which
i
had
found
in
the
vast
marshy
plain
i
had
crossed
on
my
way
here
from
the
coast
i
intended
pushing
on
to
frishikobets
a
larger
village
some
miles
off
the
old
scoundrel
wanted
to
accompany
me
part
of
the
way
saying
that
there
were
two
dangerous
rivers
to
cross
and
he
would
show
me
where
to
wade
them
i
fancied
that
they
were
as
dangerous
as
they
were
imaginary
and
i
started
off
declining
his
offer
i
came
across
several
ainu
huts
on
my
way
passed
the
village
of
pensatsunai
six
ainu
huts
on
the
satsunai
river
an
affluent
of
the
tokachi
and
then
arrived
at
obishiro
in
the
afternoon
there
are
seven
houses
at
obishiro
i
entered
one
of
them
and
to
my
astonishment
i
found
myself
in
front
of
an
old
man
and
a
pretty
woman
whose
appearance
and
manners
were
as
refined
as
those
of
the
better
classes
in
japan
a
younger
man
also
came
in
their
astonishment
was
as
great
as
mine
as
they
had
not
seen
any
civilised
beings
since
they
had
been
there
though
the
outside
of
their
dwelling
was
not
prepossessing
the
inside
was
so
clean
that
i
felt
as
if
i
had
dropped
into
heaven
after
what
i
had
gone
through
this
unexpected
brought
me
back
to
life
and
a
belief
in
the
proprieties
of
a
civilised
existence
almost
forgotten
by
now
these
people
had
a
romantic
history
watanabe
masaru
the
younger
man
was
a
japanese
gentleman
by
birth
and
education
but
he
had
no
fortune
of
an
adventurous
disposition
clever
sensitive
and
tired
of
the
conventionalities
of
his
fatherland
he
decided
eight
or
ten
years
ago
to
emigrate
to
hokkaido
and
there
lead
the
life
of
a
colonist
the
woman
he
loved
was
as
brave
and
constant
as
he
she
sailed
with
him
and
her
father
from
japan
and
after
a
long
and
perilous
journey
in
a
junk
sailing
boat
they
landed
at
the
mouth
of
the
tokachi
river
in
ainu
canoes
they
went
up
the
river
and
established
themselves
at
obishiro
far
from
civilisation
nearly
in
the
centre
of
yezo
at
first
they
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
with
the
natives
but
now
they
are
loved
by
all
there
with
two
lovely
children
they
lead
an
ideal
life
far
from
the
madding
crowd
and
noise
of
the
world
and
freed
from
the
vulgarity
of
society
i
rode
on
to
frishikobets
village
situated
on
the
frishiko
old
river
and
in
the
midst
of
a
beautiful
plain
there
are
only
houses
and
they
are
scattered
about
in
the
plain
at
a
distance
of
several
hundred
yards
one
from
the
other
some
of
the
huts
were
hidden
in
the
forest
a
peculiarity
of
the
ainu
of
the
upper
tokachi
river
is
that
they
frequently
cover
their
dwellings
and
storehouses
with
the
bark
of
trees
instead
of
with
reeds
as
is
the
custom
among
the
ainu
of
the
saru
river
and
volcano
bay
i
was
told
here
again
that
ainu
women
often
suckle
small
bears
at
their
breasts
so
as
to
fatten
them
up
for
the
festival
and
one
not
infrequently
sees
the
women
in
ainu
households
chewing
food
and
letting
the
young
cub
take
it
from
their
lips
these
ainu
are
much
more
interesting
as
types
and
also
much
purer
in
race
than
either
the
piratori
or
the
volcano
bay
ainu
a
learned
missionary
who
has
not
himself
visited
these
people
writes
as
follows
regarding
them
the
ainu
of
the
tokapchi
district
in
yezo
are
spoken
of
as
having
been
particularly
addicted
to
this
kind
of
warfare
night
raids
against
each
other
in
which
the
men
were
murdered
and
the
women
stolen
and
used
as
slaves
or
kept
as
concubines
and
are
even
now
held
in
abhorrence
by
the
people
of
some
villages
they
are
said
not
only
to
have
murdered
people
but
also
to
have
eaten
some
of
them
they
were
therefore
cannibals
and
i
have
heard
them
spoken
of
as
of
their
own
kind

from
my
own
personal
experience
and
i
may
add
i
am
the
only
foreigner
who
has
seen
these
tokachi
or
as
others
call
them
tokapchi
ainu
i
came
to
a
conclusion
very
different
from
this
i
found
that
not
only
were
they
not
cannibals
but
that
taken
altogether
they
were
the
most
peaceable
gentle
and
kind
ainu
i
came
across
during
my
peregrinations
through
the
land
of
the
hairy
people
indeed
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
it
is
not
savagery
that
makes
the
ainu
bad
but
it
is
civilisation
that
demoralises
them
the
only
place
in
yezo
where
i
was
actually
by
ainu
as
my
readers
will
remember
is
the
village
where
they
were
said
to
be
very
civilised
i
have
no
wish
to
force
my
opinion
on
the
public
as
the
correct
one
i
do
but
describe
what
i
have
actually
seen
in
a
district
in
which
others
who
have
written
on
this
subject
have
never
set
foot
and
i
leave
it
to
my
readers
to
judge
who
has
most
claim
to
be
heard
the
language
of
the
tokachi
ainu
varies
considerably
from
the
language
spoken
in
more
civilised
districts
and
none
of
the
natives
up
the
river
could
speak
japanese
when
i
was
there
illustration
ainu
woman
of
frishikobets
on
the
tokachi
river
unfortunately
the
ainu
of
this
region
are
not
very
numerous
and
constant
intermarriage
among
near
relations
has
proved
detrimental
to
the
race
however
a
glance
at
them
is
quite
sufficient
to
show
the
difference
between
them
and
ainu
of
other
tribes
they
are
not
so
picturesquely
arrayed
as
their
more
western
brothers
and
the
large
japanese
brass
and
silver

as
well
as
the

which
make

are
almost
entirely
naked
and
all
children
are
clad
in
their
own
bare
skins
only
their
winter
garments
are
made
of

skins
some
peculiar
made
of
the
bark
of
a
kind
of
called
are
sometimes
worn
over
the
winter
boots
or
moccasins
the
ainu
make
their
ropes
out
of
the
bark
of
this
though
often
young
vine
stems
are
used
for
the
same
purpose
river
are
generally
made
of
young
vines
twisted
they
are
of
the
roughest
description
and
are
only
fit
for
rivers
where
fish
is
abundant
as
in
the
yezo
watercourses
the
ainu
at
frishikobets
took
very
kindly
to
sitting
for
their
portraits
and
one
after
the
other
all
the
best
types
were
immortalised
either
in
oils
or
in
pencil
strange
to
say
i
came
across
another
old
woman
a
lunatic
very
similar
to
the
one
i
saw
at
yammakka
her
face
was
that
of
a
witch
her
eyebrows
joining
downwards
somewhat
in
the
shape
of
an
owl
beak
her
long
pale
hands
and
face
and
the
long
wild
hair
covering
half
her
face
gave
her
a
striking
appearance
she
had
however
not
yet
reached
the
stage
of
imbecility
which
her
yammakka
sister
had
attained
lunacy
is
very
common
among
the
ainu
and
the
unfortunate
creature
thus
afflicted
seems
to
lose
not
only
the
respect
but
also
the
pity
as
well
as
care
of
all
the
others
and
is
treated
by
them
as
a
worthless
animal
after
crossing
the
frishikobets
river
some
distance
off
on
the
east
side
of
the
tokachi
river
are
the
villages
of
ainu
huts
sixteen
huts
and
ottoinnai
fourteen
huts
then
comes
kinney
with
seven
houses
and
finally
nitumap
the
last
village
on
the
tokachi
river
has
as
many
as
houses

open

the
huts
of
the
tokachi
region
are
much
smaller
than
those
on
the
saru
river
and
near
many
of
them
is
a
cage
in
which
a
big
yellow
or
black
bear
is
confined
the
natives
told
me
that
yellow
and
black
bears
were
numerous
in
the
neighbourhood
deer
the
male
deer
and
female
were
formerly
plentiful
but
now
are
very
scarce
a
few
years
ago
a
pestilence
killed
great
numbers
of
them
and
since
then
they
have
dwindled
away
not
many
miles
from
frishikobets
a
huge
cliff
rises
perpendicularly
along
the
shikarubets
river
a
landslip
seems
to
have
taken
place
which
leaves
one
side
of
the
cliff
perfectly
bare
and
rugged
showing
the
strata
composing
the
soil
it
is
of
a
light
yellowish
colour
and
it
is
called
by
the
ainu
the
which
translated
into
english
means
the
white
cliff
on
the
bend
of
the
river
this
cliff
stands
very
high
and
can
be
seen
from
a
great
distance
especially
in
a
east
or
southerly
direction
in
winter
when
the
rushes
and
reeds
are
not
so
high
in
the
portion
of
the
plain
the
white
cliff
can
be
distinguished
from
the
whole
of
the
tokachi
valley
the
ainu
themselves
use
the
shikarubets
otchirsh
as
a
landmark
when
out
hunting
bears
owing
to
its
light
colour
it
is
visible
even
at
night
i
was
anxious
to
ascend
it
as
i
was
sure
no
european
foot
had
ever
trodden
on
it
before
accompanied
by
watanabe
masaru
i
started
out
on
horseback
and
crossed
the
frishikobets
village
and
river
here
we
left
our
horses
under
the
care
of
an
ainu
till
our
return
we
had
to
cross
the
tokachi
in
an
ainu
and
then
proceeding
for
several
miles
in
a
northerly
direction
we
arrived
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
climb
it
on
the
east
side
as
it
is
quite
perpendicular
but
we
were
fortunate
in
getting
an
ainu
called
unacharo
who
said
he
knew
a
point
from
which
we
could
ascend
and
that
he
would
show
us
the
way
he
had
been
hunting
bears
on
that
mountain
and
he
knew
its
slopes
well
but
as
to
the
way
which
he
was
to
show
us
we
had
to
make
it
for
ourselves
with
our
large
knives
we
were
forced
to
break
cut
and
tear
the
entangled
branches
of
trees
and
shrubs
before
we
could
get
on
we
actually
had
to
cut
our
way
through
the
dense
scrubwood
until
we
reached
the
summit
the
ascent
was
rather
dangerous
in
some
places
and
extremely
rough
when
going
through
the
brushwood
we
had
to
keep
as
much
as
possible
near
the
edge
of
the
cliff
for
though
it
involved
more
danger
if
we
slipped
or
stumbled
the
entangled
shrubs
were
not
so
thick
on
the
edge
as
farther
inland
finally
after
several
hours
hard
work
we
reached
the
top
and
were
well
repaid
for
our
fatigues
the
whole
of
the
tokachi
valley
was
stretched
before
us
as
far
as
the
sea
and
almost
the
whole
course
of
the
winding
river
with
all
its
numerous
affluents
could
be
distinguished
like
so
many
shining
silver
ribbons
on
the
green
background
formed
by
the
tall
grass
and
reeds
as
a
farming
region
the
tokachi
valley
and
high
plains
are
certainly
the
most
fertile
in
hokkaido
all
the
requisites
for
successful
agriculture
can
be
found
there
the
absence
of
the
mountain
masses
of
volcanic
rocks
so
common
all
over
hokkaido
the
richness
of
the
soil
the
quantity
of
water
for
irrigation
or
for
motive
power
besides
the
comparative
facility
of
making
roads
on
such
flat
ground
are
qualities
that
good
farmers
do
not
generally
despise
it
is
therefore
a
great
pity
to
see
all
that
tokachi
valley
practically
deserted
and
so
much
good
land
wasted
hemp
wheat
corn
potatoes
beans
and
all
kinds
of
vegetables
and
cereals
could
be
grown
with
advantage
and
the
produce
carried
down
the
river
to
the
sea
without
much
difficulty
and
at
little
expense
at
yamakubiro
the
land
begins
to
rise
in
a
gentle
slope
but
only
to
form
a
plateau
of
which
the
top
is
another
large
plain
reaching
to
the
foot
of
the
oputateishike
mountain
mass
the
otopke
mountain
is
the
highest
peak
and
resembles
in
shape
the
fujiama
of
japan
on
the
side
of
this
mountain
are
the
hot
springs
of
a
kind
of
wood
is
said
by
the
ainu
to
be
found
near
these
hot
springs
which
is
good
for
curing
wounds
cuts
rheumatism
and
other
ailments
these
hot
springs
are
not
of
much
importance
and
it
is
but
seldom
that
even
the
ainu
themselves
visit
them
in
going
to
and
returning
from
these
springs
the
shikarubets
otchirsh
is
never
lost
sight
of
by
the
ainu
and
by
the
aid
of
this
landmark
they
return
safely
to
their
homes
wood
wound
river
all
the
oputateishike
mountain
mass
is
volcanic
and
forms
the
backbone
of
the
island
of
yezo
from
the
shikarubets
otchirsh
i
was
able
to
draw
a
view
of
the
course
of
the
tokachi
river
and
its
affluents
which
afterwards
helped
me
much
in
delineating
a
of
the
tokachi
region
with
its
complicated
watercourses
the
two
high
mountains
of
satsumai
and
ghifzan
could
also
be
plainly
seen
from
there
coming
down
was
much
easier
than
going
up
and
when
we
had
again
reached
the
bottom
of
the
mountain
we
turned
northward
until
we
came
to
the
river
an
affluent
of
the
tokachi
previous
to
this
while
following
the
course
of
the
otsu
river
i
saw
a
strange
sight
when
on
the
summit
of
the
shikarubets
otchirsh
i
had
seen
two
ainu
pass
up
the
river
and
the
ainu
who
accompanied
us
said
we
should
soon
see
them
coming
back
again
we
were
not
far
from
the
river
banks
when
shouts
and
cries
of
excitement
reached
my
ears
i
hurried
on
to
the
and
saw
the
two
swiftly
coming
down
with
the
strong
current
parallel
with
each
other
at
a
distance
of
about
seven
feet
apart
there
were
three
people
in
each
a
woman
with
a
paddle
steering
at
the
prow
another
woman
crouched
up
at
the
stern
and
a
man
in
the
middle
a
coarse
net
made
of
young
vines
and
about
five
feet
square
was
fastened
to
two
poles
seven
or
eight
feet
long
the
man
who
stood
in
the
centre
of
each
canoe
held
one
of
the
poles
to
the
upper
end
of
which
the
net
was
attached
and
attentively
watched
the
water
they
are
catching
salmon
look
said
unacharo
to
me
the
salmon
are
coming
up
the
stream
from
the
sea
the
small
net
was
plunged
into
the
water
between
the
two
canoes
and
nearly
each
time
a
large
salmon
was
scooped
out
and
flung
into
one
or
other
of
the
where
the
woman
sitting
at
the
stern
crushed
its
head
with
a
large
stone
if
a
fish
escaped
yells
of
indignation
especially
from
the
women
folk
broke
out
from
the
boats
to
be
echoed
by
the
high
white
cliff
both
men
and
women
were
naked
and
the
dexterity
and
speed
with
which
they
paddled
their
canoes
down
the
stream
working
the
coarse
net
at
the
same
time
seldom
missing
a
fish
was
simply
marvellous
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
remembered
that
fish
were
so
plentiful
in
the
river
that
it
was
really
easier
to
catch
than
to
miss
in
wading
the
shikarubets
river
i
could
see
large
salmon
passing
me
by
the
dozen
and
i
felt
quite
uncomfortable
when
some
large
fish
either
rubbed
itself
against
or
passed
between
my
legs
we
got
across
the
literally
very
burning
a
place
to
stand
and
having
then
gone
far
enough
from
the
shikarubets
otchirsh
to
see
the
whole
of
it
i
managed
to
take
a
good
sketch
of
it
near
this
river
are
some
hot
springs
called
nishibets
from
which
the
river
has
taken
its
peculiar
name
the
easiest
way
to
the
otopke
mountain
is
to
follow
the
valley
between
the
shikarubets
and
the
otopke
river
and
then
climb
the
mountain
on
the
side
the
latter
part
of
the
journey
is
extremely
rough
and
difficult
watanabe
and
i
returned
to
obishiro
it
is
not
often
that
one
anywhere
meets
with
such
simple
straightforward
people
as
these
watanabes
they
have
lived
alone
at
obishiro
for
eight
years
among
savages
but
never
in
my
life
have
i
met
with
more
civilised
kind
thoughtful
gentle
beings
than
watanabe
and
his
wife
as
civilisation
makes
savages
bad
i
dare
say
savage
life
makes
civilised
people
good
i
go
away
carrying
with
me
a
deep
affection
for
these
gentle
strangers
whose
kindness
to
me
has
made
them
my
friends
the
day
came
for
me
to
return
to
the
coast
my
ponies
probably
frightened
by
bears
broke
loose
during
the
night
and
one
of
them
ran
away
and
i
was
rather
in
a
difficulty
as
to
how
i
should
get
back
whence
i
had
come
watanabe
adding
kindness
to
kindness
allowed
me
to
have
one
of
his
ponies
and
after
repeated
i
started
on
my
journey
back
to
the
coast
about
four
miles
east
of
yammakka
the
tokachi
river
receives
a
large
affluent
the
toshibets
or
river
of
high
swamps
the
tunnui
puto
is
the
largest
of
these
swamps
about
four
miles
north
of
the
mouth
of
the
toshibets
means
a
kind
of
tree
probably
the
or
means
the
mouth
of
a
river
the
course
of
the
toshibets
river
is
almost
from
due
north
to
south
from
its
source
then
for
about
six
or
seven
miles
from
to
and
sharply
turning
again
from
north
to
south
continues
in
this
direction
winding
continually
for
eighteen
or
twenty
miles
till
it
throws
itself
with
a
large
body
of
water
in
the
tokachi
river
on
the
southern
side
of
the
latter
part
of
the
watercourse
are
found
the
ainu
villages
of
pombets
huts
purokenashpa
three
huts
kenashpa
twelve
huts
and
beppo
eleven
huts
the
characteristics
of
the
natives
of
these
villages
and
their
habitations
are
similar
to
those
already
described
at
frishikobets
the
journey
down
was
much
the
same
as
that
coming
up
tobuts
on
the
north
side
of
the
tokachi
is
the
largest
ainu
village
in
the
district
and
has
as
many
as
sixty
huts
the
inhabitants
are
possessed
of
a
somewhat
fiery
temper
in
this
particular
village
and
the
day
previous
to
my
going
through
two
men
were
killed
in
a
row
i
felt
awfully
annoyed
at
being
just
one
day
too
late
to
see
it
as
then
i
might
have
described
how
the
ainu
die
however
i
reached
the
other
side
of
the
tokachi
again
a
way
through
the
same
tall
rushes
and
reeds
had
to
be
forced
and
the
same
army
of
mosquitoes
and
had
to
be
met
and
endured
it
was
my
intention
to
push
on
and
reach
the
coast
as
soon
as
possible
at
yammakka
the
natives
had
seen
my
runaway
pony
galloping
at
full
speed
towards
the
coast
but
no
one
had
caught
it
probably
no
one
had
tried
great
i
deafening
noise
i
deafening
noise
or
at
the
mouth
of
a
river
my
ponies
went
well
i
could
plainly
see
where
i
had
already
come
through
the
jungle
by
the
long
trail
of
crushed
and
broken
reeds
i
had
left
behind
me
everything
was
calm
but
for
the
monotonous
sound
of
crashing
leaves
produced
by
my
forcing
my
way
through
the
reeds
suddenly
my
ponies
stopped
shied
and
began
to
back
they
sniffed
the
ground
then
the
air
their
ears
were
straight
up
their
eyes
were
restless
and
their
nostrils
widely
distended
they
were
certainly
under
some
great
excitement
and
showed
unmistakable
signs
of
terror
what
could
be
the
cause
of
it
i
asked
myself
but
all
the
same
gave
the
ponies
a
sound
thrashing
to
make
them
go
it
was
useless
they
would
not
stir
the
second
pony
came
by
the
side
of
mine
and
they
both
put
their
heads
together
in
their
own
way
consulting
and
concerting
they
were
utterly
demoralised
and
were
kicking
awfully
it
was
getting
dark
and
this
riotous
conduct
on
the
part
of
my
ponies
was
annoying
unexpectedly
and
with
a
tremendous
growl
a
huge
black
bear
sprang
towards
us
and
tried
to
seize
the
baggage
pony
however
he
and
the
beast
i
was
riding
bolted
and
ran
a
desperate
race
for
life
and
though
bruin
followed
us
clumsily
for
some
time
we
soon
were
far
ahead
and
lost
sight
of
him
it
was
more
than
i
could
do
to
stop
the
frightened
brutes
but
finally
after
a
reckless
steeplechase
of
many
miles
after
jumping
over
brooks
and
splashing
across
torrents
flying
over
the
ground
and
through
the
jungle
without
omitting
to
anathematise
a
horsefly
that
had
settled
on
the
back
of
my
neck
and
was
amusing
itself
by
boring
holes
in
different
parts
of
it
to
find
a
suitable
spot
for
feeding
finally
we
came
to
a
halt
it
was
about
time
during
the
violent
ride
the
reeds
had
cut
my
face
and
neck
and
hands
and
i
was
bleeding
all
over
i
went
on
and
on
and
as
my
ponies
did
not
seem
to
be
very
tired
i
tried
to
reach
the
coast
that
night
it
grew
dark
but
the
night
was
fine
and
i
let
the
noise
of
the
running
river
guide
me
each
minute
seemed
an
hour
each
hour
an
age
i
rode
and
rode
and
still
rode
till
i
was
nearly
exhausted
and
still
i
was
surrounded
by
the
tall
reeds
and
rushes
thank
god
i
heartily
exclaimed
when
finally
at
a
small
hour
of
the
morning
i
found
myself
in
open
ground
again
and
the
wind
brought
in
waves
the
salt
smell
of
the
sea
an
hour
or
so
afterwards
two
tired
ponies
were
easily
pulled
up
at
the
at
otsu
the
landlord
was
roused
and
a
wearied
and
traveller
was
let
in

ainu
man
of
the
upper
tokachi
chapter
viii
from
the
tokachi
river
to
the
kutcharo
river
i
decided
to
stop
a
day
at
otsu
so
as
to
recover
from
the
fatigue
of
my
late
travels
and
adventures
and
i
chose
my
quarters
in
the
of
a
japanese
called
inomata
yoshitaro
i
was
told
that
he
was
an
be
that
as
it
may
he
had
now
turned
into
a
fisherman
and
innkeeper
like
all
japanese
he
was
an
inexhaustible
talker
and
his
politeness
was
so
great
that
it
became
a
bore
it
was
about
three
in
the
morning
when
i
reached
otsu
i
had
taken
off
my
boots
on
entering
his
house
for
it
is
an
insult
to
enter
japanese
houses
with
one
boots
on
and
i
had
seated
myself
on
the
soft
mat
in
order
to
rest
my
aching
limbs
when
yoshitaro
made
me
get
up
to
place
a
small
square
cushion
under
me
on
which
he
said
i
should
be
more
comfortable
i
had
not
been
on
it
one
minute
before
yoshitaro
wanting
to
increase
my
comforts
made
me
rise
again
to
exchange
the
first
cushion
covered
with
cotton
for
one
covered
with
silk
a
detail
to
which
a
man
is
not
likely
to
pay
much
attention
when
tired
to
death
and
only
anxious
to
be
left
alone
it
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
before
i
was
allowed
to
go
to
sleep
i
had
to
sip
several
cups
of
tea
which
yoshitaro
wife
had
hurriedly
made
and
i
had
to
relate
the
result
of
my
expedition
to
the
sleepy
fishermen
who
had
crept
out
of
their
at
the
news
of
my
arrival
in
spite
of
all
this
when
i
had
got
rid
of
my
audience
i
had
a
good
night
rest
but
when
i
woke
up
the
next
day
at
noon
i
found
myself
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
fishermen
of
otsu
who
had
invaded
the
to
have
a
peep
at
the
young
foreigner
while
in
the
back
yard
i
recognised
the
voices
of
yoshitaro
and
his
wife
who
evidently
were
occupied
in
the
exciting
chase
of
a
fowl
a
few
minutes
later
yoshitaro
triumphantly
entered
the
room
with
a
large
dish
on
which
the
same
fowl
uncooked
and
cut
into
a
thousand
little
bits
was
served
to
me
together
with
pieces
of
raw
salmon
a
vegetable
and
boiled
rice
this
he
called
a
european
dinner
i
did
my
best
to
roast
the
chicken
bits
on
the
the
brazier
but
i
was
never
well
up
in
the
culinary
art
and
as
my
landlord
remarked
he
had
brought
up
the
meat
for
me
to
eat
not
to
burn
fowls
are
very
scarce
indeed
in
hokkaido
and
the
few
found
have
been
imported
therefore
the
landlord
did
not
fail
to
explain
in
a
roundabout
manner
under
what
great
obligation
i
was
to
him
for
killing
such
a
precious
bird
i
said
that
i
had
not
asked
him
to
do
this
and
with
his
perfect
japanese
politeness
bowing
gracefully
down
to
the
ground
he
said
sayo
de
gozarimas
yes
your
honourable
sir
but
he
added
the
bird
was
so
old
that
if
i
had
not
killed
it
i
fear
it
would
have
died
by
itself
ere
long
such
a
sacrifice
undoubtedly
deserved
a
reward
and
he
assured
me
that
we
should
be
quite
even
if
i
being
an
artist
would
condescend
to
paint
twelve
portraits
of
him
i
had
no
little
trouble
to
make
him
understand
that
he
was
mistaking
me
for
a
photographic
camera
but
i
offered
to
paint
him
a
small
sketch
the
next
morning
if
he
would
leave
me
alone
all
that
day
punctually
at
sunrise
he
entered
my
room
he
had
his
best
clothes
on
and
his
anxiety
to
be
painted
was
such
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
sleep
all
night
i
painted
the
sketch
and
yoshitaro
and
his
male
and
female
friends
joined
in
exclamations
of
admiration
at
the
good
result
of
the
oil
painting
he
professed
to
be
very
grateful
and
carefully
packed
the
picture
in
a
box
which
he
carried
into
another
room
i
took
advantage
of
his
absence
to
pack
up
my
traps
as
i
wished
to
leave
for
shaubets
that
same
morning
in
a
short
time
yoshitaro
came
back
to
my
room
but
a
different
man
he
was
rude
and
tried
to
bully
me
he
presented
a
bill
for
the
sum
of
sixteen
equivalent
to
in
english
money
which
i
considered
exorbitant
for
two
nights
rest
a
few
bowls
of
rice
and
the
european
dinner
the
highest
charge
made
by
the
very
best
in
hokkaido
never
exceeds
one
yen
two
shillings
and
tenpence
a
day
including
all
meals
i
quietly
told
the
landlord
that
he
was
a
thief
and
that
i
would
punish
him
by
taking
the
picture
away
from
him
but
he
swore
that
he
would
not
surrender
it
and
that
he
would
fight
for
it
if
necessary
i
seldom
refuse
a
challenge
when
i
know
that
i
am
going
to
get
the
best
of
it
and
as
it
so
happened
that
my
arms
were
a
great
deal
longer
than
those
of
yoshitaro
i
caught
him
by
the
throat
and
shook
him
so
violently
that
he
was
nearly
strangled
his
friends
came
to
his
rescue
and
when
i
dropped
him
he
fell
heavily
on
the
mats
and
had
to
be
carried
away
some
minutes
elapsed
and
while
i
was
hastily
taking
my
heavier
luggage
out
of
the
house
i
heard
yoshitaro
in
the
next
room
call
out
to
his
wife
to
bring
him
a
sword
as
he
wanted
to
kill
the
the
fool
of
a
foreigner
i
entered
his
room
yoshitaro
pale
with
rage
was
sitting
by
his
and
round
him
were
eight
or
ten
of
his
men
they
were
apparently
holding
a
congress
on
what
to
do
and
each
one
of
them
as
is
usual
on
all
occasions
in
japan
had
pulled
out
his
little
pipe
and
was
continually
refilling
it
with
tobacco
as
they
all
discussed
the
matter
on
hand
i
had
my
boots
on
this
time
as
i
wished
to
show
the
scorn
i
had
for
him
his
friends
and
his
house
in
my
coat
pocket
the
only
sound
one
i
had
my
revolver
but
it
was
not
loaded
yoshitaro
i
said
deliver
the
picture
at
once
i
will
not
said
he
good
said
his
friends
in
a
chorus
yoshitaro
i
said
again
producing
the
revolver
and
pointing
it
at
him
if
i
have
not
the
picture
before
i
count
twenty
you
will
be
a
dead
man
i
never
in
my
life
saw
a
crowd
of
bullies
so
scared
covering
their
faces
with
their
hands
yoshitaro
friends
bolted
in
all
directions
some
jumping
out
of
the
window
some
dashing
through
the
paper
sliding
doors
leaving
eight
or
ten
pipes
and
as
many
tobacco
pouches
scattered
on
the
mats
the
landlord
a
moment
ago
so
brave
had
not
strength
to
get
up
so
great
was
his
terror
pale
as
death
and
with
a
trembling
voice
he
called
imploringly
to
his
wife
servants
and
friends
to
come
and
deliver
up
the
picture
i
had
counted
up
to
number
fourteen
and
no
one
had
put
in
an
appearance
then
i
incidentally
mentioned
to
yoshitaro
that
time
was
nearly
up
and
enquired
if
he
preferred
to
be
shot
through
the
head
or
the
heart
at
the
same
time
cocking
my
revolver
yoshitaro
shuddered
at
number
sixteen
a
little
girl
the
only
brave
one
of
the
lot
was
sent
to
his
help
dutchera
danna
where
is
it
sir
she
asked
him
quite
perplexed
hatchera
hayaku
hayaku
nesan
it
is
there
quick
quick
girl
pointing
to
a
closet
in
which
a
pile
of
small
mattresses
were
kept
rolled
during
the
day
yoshitaro
had
hidden
the
sketch
so
well
in
the
closet
that
the
little
could
not
find
it
and
when
i
called
out
number
nineteen
the
poor
girl
discomfited
cried
out
i
do
not
see
it
a
corruption
of
yoshitaro
was
more
dead
than
alive
his
lips
were
white
and
he
tried
to
articulate
some
words
but
could
not
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
closet
were
glazed
and
set
his
body
was
beginning
to
collapse
and
every
moment
i
thought
that
he
would
faint
in
the
meantime
the
hurriedly
pulled
out
all
the
and
unrolled
them
and
the
box
with
the
sketch
fell
out
just
as
i
was
about
to
call
out
number
twenty
she
gave
me
the
box
and
sketch
and
i
told
yoshitaro
that
he
must
now
come
out
with
me
and
putting
my
revolver
in
my
pocket
i
pulled
the
man
to
the
entrance
door
several
villagers
had
collected
at
a
respectful
distance
on
the
road
waiting
for
the
report
of
the
revolver
yoshitaro
wife
was
the
farthest
of
all
i
signed
to
them
to
come
nearer
and
seeing
that
the
revolver
was
no
longer
in
my
hands
they
came
though
very
reluctantly
yoshitaro
was
beginning
to
breathe
again
and
when
a
sufficient
crowd
had
collected
i
compelled
him
to
accuse
himself
before
them
all
of
being
a
thief
and
to
confess
that
he
was
glad
to
have
been
punished
also
i
made
him
promise
that
he
would
not
play
such
tricks
again
on
any
other
traveller
the
japanese
are
fond
of
a
good
joke
even
when
it
is
played
off
on
one
of
themselves
and
when
i
had
seen
all
my
baggage
safe
on
my
i
gave
yoshitaro
the
sixteen
dollars
he
had
asked
me
two
dollars
i
said
in
settlement
of
my
bill
and
fourteen
to
go
to
your
doctor
for
restoring
you
to
good
health
after
the
fright
you
have
had
to
show
how
shabby
yoshitaro
nature
was
it
is
enough
to
state
that
out
of
the
sum
received
his
munificence
went
to
the
extent
of
five
as
a
present
to
the
girl
who
had
come
to
save
his
life
when
my
ponies
were
ready
i
showed
yoshitaro
and
his
knavish
friends
how
i
had
sold
them
i
brought
out
my
revolver
again
and
they
all
saw
that
not
a
single
cartridge
was
in
any
of
its
chambers
this
done
i
bade
them
and
left
them
to
reflect
that
it
is
not
always
the
quietest
persons
who
can
be
imposed
on
with
most
impunity
but
that
sometimes
such
quiet
persons
get
the
best
of
it
even
against
ten
bullies
or
more
banded
together
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
good
many
of
my
readers
will
think
me
cruel
for
carrying
a
joke
so
far
but
on
the
other
hand
if
placed
in
similar
circumstances
when
no
redress
from
without
is
to
be
obtained
and
one
must
defend
oneself
by
main
force
very
few
would
treat
such
a
serious
imposition
and
offence
as
a
joke
in
going
through
the
village
more
than
one
fisherman
came
to
tell
me
that
i
had
done
right
in
dealing
severely
with
yoshitaro
as
he
was
known
to
be
a
scoundrel
and
a
thief
and
they
all
detested
him
there
was
little
of
interest
between
otsu
and
shaubets
with
the
exception
of
the
beautiful
delta
formed
in
the
low
alluvial
valley
by
the
otsu
river
and
the
tokachi
river
two
large
estuaries
nearly
two
miles
apart
by
which
the
tokachi
river
enters
the
sea
the
tokachi
is
a
river
of
large
volume
and
considerable
length
and
even
when
divided
the
body
of
water
carried
by
both
outlets
is
so
great
as
to
make
it
necessary
to
cross
in
boats
fording
on
foot
being
quite
impossible
the
urahoro
river
was
successfully
crossed
but
for
the
twenty
miles
on
to
shahubets
the
track
was
flat
and
sandy
lying
mostly
under
high
clay
banks
some
of
which
form
picturesque
headlands
the
country
is
not
mountainous
in
the
proximity
of
the
coast
but
it
is
of
a
moderate
elevation
all
through
and
wooded
with
deciduous
trees
the
formation
of
the
coast
from
cape
erimo
to
cape
noshafu
is
in
many
ways
unlike
that
of
the
coast
the
part
is
more
mountainous
and
is
further
characterised
by
the
absence
of
extensive
plains
the
is
indented
and
there
is
a
striking
want
of
broad
beaches
precipitous
rocks
are
also
frequent
along
the
coast
and
thick
deposits
of
pumice
as
we
have
seen
are
lying
over
quaternary
rocks
filling
up
the
declivities
of
mountain
lands
and
river
shores
in
the
western
part
the
tertiaries
are
more
tufaceous
than
on
the
coast
and
they
are
distinguished
mainly
by
the
presence
of
shales
and
andesite
breccia
the
part
is
characterized
by
the
almost
entire
absence
of
volcanic
rocks
and
older
eruptive
rocks
after
leaving
the
range
of
mountains
forming
the
east
and
west
of
cape
erimo
high
land
is
met
all
the
way
along
the
coast
nevertheless
pumice
is
found
in
the
basin
of
the
tokachi
river
and
also
in
that
of
the
kushiro
river
but
it
does
not
form
the
surface
soil
covering
large
areas
of
ground
as
in
many
places
on
the
portion
of
the
coast
the
different
aspect
in
the
tertiaries
of
the
and
coast
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
presence
of
breccia
and
conglomerate
shales
and
sandstones
on
the
western
part
while
on
the
eastern
coast
beds
of
lignite
coal
of
inferior
quality
and
diatom
earth
form
the
tertiary
strata
if
it
were
not
for
the
total
want
of
harbours
or
even
moderately
sheltered
anchorages
for
ships
this
portion
of
yezo
with
its
agricultural
resources
its
milder
climate
and
the
facilities
that
it
offers
for
the
construction
of
roads
and
railways
ought
to
support
a
large
population
as
things
stand
now
there
are
no
colonists
inland
and
the
coast
is
deserted
and
as
i
have
mentioned
before
the
only
drawbacks
are
the
thick
fogs
prevailing
during
the
summer
months
along
the
coast
and
i
believe
that
this
in
some
measure
accounts
for
the
japanese
not
wishing
to
settle
in
a
part
of
the
country
so
depressing
to
their
spirits
and
so
trying
to
their
nerves
i
have
often
noticed
how
easily
affected
the
subjects
are
by
atmospheric
and
geographical
conditions
and
how
before
settling
to
do
business
they
make
a
point
of
finding
some
pleasant
spot
where
to
cast
anchor
thinking
more
of
the
amenities
of
physical
existence
than
of
the
facilities
for
successful
trade
i
did
not
see
a
single
house
for
twenty
miles
until
i
reached
shaubets
a
village
of
eleven
ainu
huts
and
one
japanese
house
thousands
of
and
penguins
lined
the
sandy
shore
and
i
saw
several
large
black
a
pretty
waterfall
gently
descending
from
the
high
grey
cliff
was
decidedly
ornamental
to
the
scenery
and
useful
to
the
wayfarer
as
it
afforded
my
ponies
and
myself
a
good
drink
of
deliciously
fresh
water
far
off
in
the
distance
i
could
distinguish
a
long
tongue
of
land
at
shaubets
i
was
told
that
it
was
the
peninsula
on
which
or
as
the
japanese
call
it
is
situated
i
left
shaubets
early
in
the
morning
with
the
intention
of
pushing
on
to
kushiro
miles
distant
at
shiranuka
only
ten
miles
from
shaubets
i
changed
my
ponies
shiranuka
is
an
ainu
village
the
inhabitants
of
which
employ
themselves
in
collecting
and
drying
seaweed
there
are
also
seven
or
eight
japanese
shanties
besides
the
ainu
huts
at
the
mouth
of
the
near
the
latter
village
coal
and
lignite
of
inferior
quality
are
found
but
this
coalfield
was
not
worked
at
the
time
i
passed
through
shiranuka
the
remaining
miles
were
monotonous
and
uninteresting
the
long
peninsula
was
before
me
increasing
in
size
as
i
drew
nearer
and
after
having
gone
through
the
two
small
villages
of
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
kossuri
i
crossed
the
kutcharo
river
on
a
wooden
bridge
and
found
myself
at
kushiro
an
important
japanese
settlement
on
the
coast
from
its
favourable
situation
kushiro
is
likely
to
become
one
of
the
chief
towns
in
yezo
though
unfortunately
it
does
not
possess
a
good
harbour
and
is
much
exposed
to
westerly
winds
the
largest
number
of
the
houses
are
situated
on
a
slight
elevation
above
the
immediately
south
of
the
river
mouth
in
the
proximity
of
kushiro
and
just
beyond
the
range
of
hills
which
stretches
for
about
three
miles
from
the
entrance
of
the
harbour
in
a
northerly
and
for
about
two
miles
in
an
easterly
direction
is
a
lagoon
called
by
the
ainu
harutori
this
lagoon
is
nearly
two
miles
long
and
certainly
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
it
is
divided
from
the
sea
by
a
very
narrow
strip
of
sand
through
which
the
water
of
the
lagoon
finds
its
outlet
on
the
east
side
of
the
harutori
coal
has
been
discovered
and
it
seems
to
be
of
fairly
good
quality
and
three
miles
further
quite
close
to
the
coal
was
dug
out
some
years
ago
but
the
quality
was
so
inferior
that
the
works
had
to
be
abandoned
there
is
a
considerable
area
of
good
land
in
the
neighbourhood
of
kushiro
and
here
again
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
japanese
farmers
do
not
emigrate
to
work
it
yezo
has
a
very
small
population
for
its
size
and
i
was
surprised
that
emigration
from
the
mainland
was
not
carried
out
on
a
larger
scale
yezo
is
a
rich
country
in
many
ways
why
do
not
all
the
troublesome
students
the
fiery
of
japan
abandon
politics
and
futile
rows
and
go
and
do
men
work
in
that
northern
region
of
the
empire
they
would
profit
by
it
and
so
would
their
country
an
immense
loss
occurs
every
year
simply
because
no
one
is
there
to
take
the
profit
and
it
is
a
great
pity
and
almost
a
shame
to
see
so
much
waste
and
neglect
in
a
region
which
after
all
is
not
difficult
of
access
from
the
main
island
of
nippon
to
the
mineral
products
of
the
kushiro
district
must
be
added
the
exports
of
fish
salmon
and
herrings
fish
manure
and
seaweed
which
could
be
greatly
increased
if
more
practical
processes
were
used
the
town
of
kushiro
itself
is
not
picturesque
there
are
i
dare
say
as
many
as
five
hundred
houses
some
built
in
japanese
some
in
style
the
streets
are
very
wide
and
along
the
main
street
rails
have
been
laid
to
carry
coal
trucks
from
the
harutori
mine
down
to
the
shipping
point
thus
the
town
has
a
civilised
appearance
which
was
artistically
ugly
enough
but
refreshing
to
my
eyes
after
my
experiences
along
the
and
coasts
there
are
ainu
huts
along
the
river
banks
on
the
high
lands
and
on
the
strip
of
sand
between
lake
harutori
and
the
sea
unfortunately
most
of
the
ainu
here
being
in
the
employ
of
the
japanese
have
adopted
japanese
clothes
customs
manners
and
language
nearly
all
the
younger
folks
are
a
select
few
have
even
gone
so
far
as
to
forget
their
strongest
national
characteristic
of
dirt
and
to
my
great
amazement
one
day
i
saw
an
ainu
actually
taking
a
hot
bath
it
may
amuse
the
reader
to
learn
of
what
this
japanese
bathing
accommodation
generally
consists
it
is
one
of
the
features
in
nearly
all
fishing
stations
in
yezo
and
it
is
worth
describing
when
the
day
work
is
over
one
or
more
of
the
iron
or
caldrons
used
for
extracting
the
oil
from
herrings
are
filled
with
water
these
caldrons
rest
each
on
a
cylindrical
base
of
stones
and
clay
thus
allowing
a
big
fire
of
wood
to
be
lighted
under
them
when
the
water
has
reached
a
high
temperature
the
bather
either
provides
himself
with
an
old
pair
of
straw
sandals
and
steps
in
or
placing
a
small
board
on
the
water
places
his
foot
on
it
and
forces
it
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
caldron
by
his
own
weight
he
thus
avoids
scalding
his
feet
which
otherwise
he
would
do
severely
i
have
often
seen
two
or
three
men
japanese
placidly
sitting
up
to
their
necks
in
the
steaming
water
of
the
same
caldron
with
a
huge
fire
burning
under
it
and
several
times
i
have
been
invited
by
the
bathers
to
join
them
which
invitation
however
i
invariably
considered
and
declined
with
thanks
as
regards
the
ainu
they
are
not
fond
of
bathing
or
washing
and
they
share
the
chinese
idea
that
it
is
only
dirty
people
who
need
continual
washing
they
do
not
regard
themselves
as
dirty
and
therefore
dispense
with
such
an
uncleanly
habit
you
white
people
must
be
very
dirty
once
said
an
ainu
to
me
as
i
was
taking
a
plunge
into
a
limpid
river
as
you
tell
me
that
you
bathe
in
the
river
every
day
and
what
about
yourself
i
asked
him
oh
nishpa
he
replied
with
an
air
of
contempt
i
am
very
clean
and
have
never
needed
washing
if
kushiro
is
not
interesting
to
an
artist
it
is
decidedly
so
from
an
archæological
point
of
view
numerous
pits
forts
and
camps
flint
implements
and
fragments
of
pottery
are
found
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
town
both
on
the
range
of
hills
and
along
the
west
shore
of
lake
harutori
the
pits
are
found
in
such
numbers
as
to
lead
one
to
believe
that
the
old
kossuri
of
the
ainu
was
once
the
capital
of
a
race
of
previous
to
the
conquest
of
the
whole
of
yezo
by
the
hairy
race
the
ainu
gave
these
people
the
name
of
men
of
the
holes
a
few
words
on
them
may
not
be
out
of
place
though
unfortunately
little
is
to
be
learned
from
the
ainu
as
to
who
their
predecessors
were
and
it
is
merely
by
a
close
examination
of
their
pits
and
relics
found
in
different
parts
of
yezo
and
the
kuriles
that
we
can
to
a
certain
extent
trace
the
existence
of
such
a
race
of
people
and
also
prove
that
they
were
in
no
way
connected
with
the
present

remains
of
an
extinct
race
of
are
to
be
seen
it
is
especially
near
lakes
and
swamps
or
along
the
coast
that
rectangular
circular
and
elliptical
pits
are
numerous
but
square
pits
are
not
so
common
none
of
these
pits
have
yet
been
discovered
on
the
main
island
of
nippon
but
many
are
still
to
be
found
as
far
south
as
hakodate
in
yezo
on
the
east
and
side
of
the
peak
at
the
latter
port
these
pits
flint
implements
and
rude
pottery
mostly
in
fragments
are
met
with
in
great
abundance
the
implements
consist
mostly
of
stone
adzes
hammers
flint
knives
and
round
pebbles
which
were
used
as
war
ammunition
the
vary
in
size
length
and
breadth
the
larger
ones
i
saw
measured
an
inch
and
in
length
by
an
inch
and
in
breadth
while
the
smaller
were
of
an
inch
by
half
an
inch
they
were
triangular
with
the
angle
at
the
point
sometimes
more
sometimes
less
acute
or
they
are
chipped
and
not
ground
most
of
the
and
a
good
many
of
the
knives
were
made
of
a
dark
reddish
siliceous
rock
the
adzes
also
of
course
varied
in
size
and
shape
some
being
oblong
in
section
others
almost
rectangular
while
others
again
were
oval
they
were
ground
and
always
made
so
that
the
hand
could
have
a
good
grip
on
them
the
average
length
from
the
sharp
edge
to
the
other
end
would
be
about
four
inches
and
the
sides
were
rounded
it
is
apparent
that
most
of
these
adzes
were
not
originally
fastened
to
a
stick
or
club
but
were
held
in
the
hand
they
usually
have
a
smooth
surface
while
the
knives
as
well
as
the
exhibit
marks
of
chipping
quite
plainly
their
edges
are
very
sharp
hard
stones
are
often
found
on
which
the
people
of
the
stone
age
used
to
grind
their
implements
the
knives
are
mostly
rectangular
with
very
sharp
edges
sometimes
on
both
sides
then
there
are
some
in
the
shape
of
a
rounded
at
the
top
and
with
a
rounded
place
at
the
other
end
where
they
were
held
those
with
two
sharp
edges
were
triangular
in
shape
and
were
held
by
the
upper
part
of
the
triangle
which
point
ends
with
a
kind
of
knob
it
is
a
curious
fact
that
bone
and
bamboo
probably
ainu
are
sometimes
found
in
pits
and
this
would
lead
me
to
believe
either
that
the
conquering
ainu
used
these
weapons
in
their
attacks
upon
the
or
supposing
for
a
moment
that
the
ainu
themselves
were
the
in
former
days
that
they
had
abandoned
their
stone
implements
and
had
adopted
bone
and
wood
which
they
found
easier
to
work
i
am
inclined
to
the
first
supposition
as
the
correct
one
the
pits
are
numerous
in
yezo
and
following
the
southern
coast
from
to
we
find
that
they
increase
in
number
towards
the
north
though
stone
implements
and
fragments
of
pottery
are
numerous
nearly
all
along
the
southern
coast
but
few
pits
are
found
either
on
volcano
bay
or
on
the
part
of
the
coast
as
far
as
erimo
cape
as
we
pass
this
cape
and
go
north
on
the
coast
the
pits
become
more
numerous
and
at
kushiro
or
kossuri
as
the
ainu
call
it
they
are
found
in
great
quantities
further
on
are
some
at
akkeshi
and
they
are
plentiful
nearly
all
along
that
stretch
of
the
coast
as
far
as
nemuro
and
on
bentenjima
the
small
island
which
forms
one
side
of
the
harbour
at
that
place
of
that
in
the
kuriles
at
kunashiri
and
etorofu
we
have
abundant
evidence
that
a
large
population
of
these
once
existed
there
in
etorofu
particularly
the
pits
besides
being
frequent
are
in
much
better
preservation
than
any
on
the
island
of
yezo
illustration
flint
knives
the
do
not
seem
to
have
been
particular
as
to
the
shape
of
their
dwellings
though
they
evidently
had
a
certain
predilection
for
the
elliptical
and
rectangular
forms
the
pits
at
kushiro
are
nearly
all
rectangular
while
those
from
akkeshi
to
nemuro
are
either
rectangular
or
circular
the
average
dimensions
of
rectangular
pits
are
about
twelve
feet
by
nine
feet
but
i
have
seen
some
as
large
as
sixteen
feet
by
twelve
feet
the
sides
slope
inwards
and
the
average
depth
is
from
three
to
six
feet
pits
which
are
situated
on
cliffs
or
at
any
height
are
generally
deeper
probably
for
the
extra
shelter
required
by
those
living
at
an
altitude
compared
with
those
living
on
the
the
round
pits
are
from
ten
to
fourteen
feet
in
diameter
and
the
elliptical
have
a
length
of
about
sixteen
feet
and
are
about
eight
feet
at
the
widest
part
of
the
ellipse
the
pits
which
i
found
on
the
coast
of
yezo
from
shari
to
cape
soya
were
not
so
numerous
as
those
on
the
southern
coast
but
some
of
them
were
larger
in
size
as
probably
owing
to
the
greater
severity
of
the
climate
more
people
lived
in
the
same
hut
for
the
purpose
of
creating
natural
heat
at
tobuts
on
the
saruma
lake
are
three
of
elliptical
shape
near
abashiri
several
specimens
of
pottery
have
been
found
especially
in
the
mud
of
swamps
or
lakes
but
after
leaving
lake
saruma
i
did
not
see
any
traces
of
the
till
i
approached
soya
cape
when
these
pits
are
excavated
a
stratum
of
sand
is
generally
found
and
beneath
it
a
large
quantity
of
charcoal
in
the
centre
of
the
pit
under
the
charcoal
the
earth
is
burnt
showing
that
the
hearth
was
in
the
centre
of
the
dwelling
as
it
is
now
in
the
ainu
huts
this
goes
to
prove
that
there
was
one
fire
and
not
as
some
travellers
have
endeavoured
to
show
five
or
six
burning
at
the
same
time
round
which
or
rather
between
which
the
slept
i
have
often
dug
in
different
parts
of
pits
and
have
invariably
come
upon
this
burnt
charcoal
in
or
near
the
middle
i
never
saw
any
signs
of
more
than
one
fire
in
the
same
pit
digging
in
a
large
pit
at
kushiro
i
found
some
and
numerous
bits
of
black
and
red
pottery
some
of
the
fragments
had
rough
line
ornamentations
on
them
there
was
also
a
large
quantity
of
war
ammunition
in
the
shape
of
big
pebbles
and
round
stones
most
pits
contain
heaps
of
rubbish
and
bones
of
animals
sometimes
there
are
heaps
of
oyster
shells
as
near
the
pits
on
saruma
lake
and
these
are
similar
to
those
found
on
the
main
island
of
nippon
in
another
pit
on
one
of
the
forts
at
kushiro
i
found
what
i
thought
was
part
of
a
human
skull
but
on
a
closer
examination
it
turned
out
to
be
the
skull
of
an
animal
probably
a
fox
or
a
stag
a
bone
also
came
to
light
in
the
same
pit
and
several
stone
defensive
weapons
it
was
interesting
to
note
that
this
pit
was
built
on
the
top
of
a
small
conical
hill
and
that
the
hill
itself
was
surrounded
by
a
ditch
only
a
few
feet
wide
thus
forming
a
kind
of
fort
on
the
side
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
fort
i
saw
numbers
of
stones
which
had
in
all
probability
been
used
by
the
as
missiles
against
the
attacking
ainu
during
a
battle
besides
forts
the
had
camps
generally
situated
in
a
commanding
position
above
a
river
a
lake
or
a
harbour
single
pits
also
are
found
only
under
similar
conditions
near
kushiro
on
the
lake
harutori
which
is
divided
from
the
sea
by
a
sand
isthmus
are
several
camps
and
one
or
two
forts
the
first
of
which
overlooks
the
sea
along
the
kutcharo
river
are
forts
and
camps
these
camps
are
on
the
crowns
of
the
hills
and
each
is
surrounded
by
a
small
ditch
in
the
last
about
three
miles
from
the
coast
were
several
square
pits
larger
than
those
on
the
other
three
forts
this
last
fort
stands
some
distance
back
from
the
river
and
is
situated
in
a
little
plain
at
the
summit
of
a
detached
mound
which
has
the
appearance
of
having
been
artificially
cut
from
the
larger
remaining
portion
of
the
hill
itself
the
shape
of
the
fort
is
a
broken
cone
and
the
base
measures
about
nine
hundred
feet
in
circumference
while
the
upper
one
is
about
three
hundred
from
the
top
where
there
is
only
a
small
pit
the
entrance
of
the
river
can
easily
be
watched
and
it
must
have
been
almost
impregnable
as
the
walls
of
the
fort
or
rather
the
sides
of
the
conical
hill
rise
nearly
perpendicularly
from
the
plain
a
small
stream
runs
at
the
foot
of
the
fort
on
the
lake
harutori
the
range
of
hills
which
stretches
from
the
sea
for
three
or
four
miles
along
its
eastern
shores
is
literally
covered
with
these
pits
and
on
the
sandy
isthmus
separating
the
sea
from
the
lake
some
very
large
pits
can
be
observed
the
fort
near
the
sea
is
called
by
the
ainu
and
that
at
the
other
end
of
the
range
goes
by
the
name
of
it
was
in
the
latter
fort
that
the
bone
was
found
as
well
as
one
or
two
stone
adzes
which
were
so
shaped
as
to
fit
the
hand
and
evidently
had
been
used
as
hammers
or
weapons
of
offence
at
close
quarters
in
the
same
fort
i
found
two
stags
horns
in
good
preservation
and
many
bones
of
different
animals
it
is
doubtful
whether
these
heaps
of
horns
and
bones
were
brought
into
the
pits
for
the
purpose
of
making
and
other
weapons
or
whether
the
stags
had
been
used
merely
for
food
the
bone
found
in
the
same
pit
was
not
in
such
a
decayed
condition
as
most
of
the
bones
i
found
there
which
led
me
to
believe
that
it
was
not
made
out
of
the
same
kind
of
bone
or
that
the
bone
out
of
which
it
was
made
had
been
cured
before
its
conversion
into
an
i
believe
that
in
the
neighbourhood
of
kusuri
or
kushiro
as
it
is
now
called
by
the
japanese
there
are
as
many
as
a
thousand
or
fifteen
hundred
pits
in
etorofu
at
on
the
coast
of
the
island
nearly
as
many
are
to
be
found
along
the
seashore
mostly
on
the
plain
at
the
top
of
the
cliffs
overlooking
the
sea
while
the
rest
are
situated
on
the
banks
of
a
narrow
stream
and
along
what
appears
to
have
been
a
river
course
on
the
same
island
at
are
several
pits
of
a
similar
description
and
a
fort
as
the
have
disappeared
from
yezo
and
the
kuriles
and
only
remains
and
relics
have
been
left
behind
to
indicate
their
former
existence
the
questions
naturally
arise
who
were
these
whence
did
they
come
and
whither
have
they
gone
we
can
place
no
reliance
on
the
accounts
given
by
the
ainu
or
by
the
highly
imaginative
japanese
who
moreover
are
perfectly
ignorant
on
this
subject
some
ainu
say
that
yezo
was
formerly
peopled
by
a
race
of
dwarfs
who
were
their
enemies
and
were
extirpated
by
them
after
many
sanguinary
battles
the
ainu
are
very
vague
as
to
when
and
where
these
battles
were
fought
but
according
to
their
accounts
these
whom
they
call
the
literally
men
of
holes
once
inhabited
yezo
and
the
kuriles
they
were
only
three
or
four
feet
in
height
and
some
stories
represent
them
as
being
only
a
few
inches
tall
this
of
course
might
be
taken
to
mean
that
they
were
very
small
by
comparison
a
few
ainu
yet
more
imaginative
than
others
go
so
far
as
to
say
gravely
that
the
were
so
tiny
that
when
a
shower
of
rain
came
they
hid
under
burdock
leaves
for
shelter
others
however
tell
us
that
these
were
their
ancestors
and
much
more
hairy
than
the
ainu
of
the
present
day
they
were
strong
fond
of
hunting
and
able
to
cross
the
mountains
with
great
facility
and
speed
according
to
batchelor
some
ainu
state
that
they
themselves
formerly
lived
in
huts
over
pits
and
that
they
changed
their
method
of
on
coming
in
contact
with
the
japanese
but
if
this
were
the
case
it
seems
unaccountable
that
they
should
distinguish
their
predecessors
as
moreover
if
the
influence
of
the
japanese
was
sufficiently
strong
to
cause
them
to
make
this
most
important
change
in
their
habitations
and
mode
of
living
how
comes
it
that
in
other
matters
they
have
not
adopted
japanese
customs
i
was
unable
to
trace
the
slightest
resemblance
between
ainu
huts
and
japanese
edifices
of
any
kind
either
in
their
general
appearance
or
in
any
of
the
smaller
details
and
i
was
always
struck
by
the
small
extent
to
which
the
ainu
have
adopted
the
customs
of
the
dominant
race
indeed
the
character
of
ainu
buildings
is
peculiar
to
the
ainu
themselves
and
far
from
constructing
their
dwellings
over
pits
they
go
to
the
other
extreme
and
perch
their
storehouses
on
piles
or
posts
it
is
a
remarkable
coincidence
that
on
the
lake
kutcharo
not
many
miles
from
kusuri
where
the
pits
are
numerous
the
roofs
of
the
ainu
huts
and
storehouses
are
not
angular
but
circular
which
gives
them
the
appearance
of
half
a
cylinder
resting
on
the
ground
this
struck
me
as
being
in
all
probability
the
shape
of
structures
built
over
rectangular
pits
while
the
coverings
of
round
pits
must
have
been
shaped
like
half
a
sphere
similar
to
the
snow
houses
of
the
esquimaux
and
the
elliptical
like
the
longer
half
of
an
egg
the
present
houses
of
the
kutcharo
lake
ainu
however
are
not
built
on
pits
and
on
my
questioning
the
few
inhabitants
of
the
village
all
were
perfectly
ignorant
of
the
existence
of
the
and
they
knew
nothing
of
their
own
ancestors
nor
whether
they
had
built
structures
over
pits
or
not
the
idea
seemed
to
them
highly
ludicrous
and
afforded
them
a
great
deal
of
amusement
on
the
coast
of
yezo
where
pits
are
found
some
ainu
huts
have
round
and
others
angular
roofs
but
even
in
the
latter
instance
the
angle
of
the
two
sides
of
the
roof
is
not
as
acute
as
with
the
huts
on
the
saru
and
the
tokachi
river
but
both
slant
in
a
more
gentle
way
forming
an
obtuse
angle
of
about
in
fact
these
variations
in
the
ainu
architecture
have
not
yet
been
accounted
for
and
whether
they
copied
their
roofs
from
their
foes
the
or
whether
it
is
a
mere
chance
that
the
roofs
bear
a
certain
resemblance
can
not
be
discovered
from
tradition
or
hearsay
i
may
mention
incidentally
my
own
theory
which
may
afford
an
explanation
of
this
point
as
the
saru
the
tokachi
and
the
ishikari
districts
have
no
very
severe
weather
in
winter
and
only
a
comparatively
small
quantity
of
snow
falls
during
the
colder
months
the
ainu
build
huts
with
very
slanting
roofs
so
that
the
snow
should
not
remain
on
them
in
winter
while
during
the
summer
months
the
rain
should
fall
off
the
steep
incline
of
the
roof
before
it
could
filter
through
into
the
hut
on
the
kutcharo
lake
and
on
the
coast
where
strong
winds
are
prevalent
the
huts
have
round
roofs
so
as
to
offer
the
least
possible
resistance
to
the
gales
and
thus
escape
the
danger
of
being
blown
down
with
regard
to
the
snow
the
opposite
of
the
saru
ainu
method
is
practised
instead
of
preventing
the
snow
from
resting
on
their
roofs
the
ainu
of
the
colder
regions
do
all
they
can
to
let
it
remain
for
by
thus
forming
an
vault
it
renders
the
hut
much
warmer
in
winter
in
other
words
the
system
is
the
same
as
that
adopted
by
the
esquimaux
with
the
exception
that
the
latter
i
believe
have
no
frame
to
their
huts
and
the
vault
is
entirely
of
snow
and
ice
while
with
the
ainu
of
the
coast
the
snow
vault
is
directly
over
the
hut
itself
i
invariably
noticed
on
the
coast
where
the
ainu
have
a
mixed
architecture
that
wherever
a
hut
was
built
in
an
exposed
position
it
had
a
round
roof
while
those
built
under
the
shelter
of
a
cliff
or
a
hill
had
angular
ones
and
this
is
what
led
me
to
the
above
conclusion
to
return
to
the
they
undoubtedly
must
have
had
and
roofs
over
their
pits
whether
the
vault
was
constructed
of
mud
sticks
and
reeds
or
simply
of
snow
and
ice
like
the
esquimaux
dwellings
for
all
that
we
know
the
huts
may
have
had
conical
roofs
like
those
of
the
present
american
indians
but
one
fact
is
certain
that
whatever
shape
the
roof
may
have
had
it
was
not
supported
by
a
central
pole
for
the
hearth
is
invariably
in
the
centre
of
the
pit
the
curious
fact
already
mentioned
that
in
every
pit
we
find
a
thick
layer
of
sand
seems
to
prove
that
it
was
certainly
intended
to
render
the
ground
less
damp
and
it
is
my
own
impression
that
these
having
snow
or
ice
vaults
over
their
heads
resorted
to
that
expedient
to
keep
the
floor
of
their
huts
dry
under
the
continuous
dripping
of
the
vault
melted
by
the
heat
of
the
fire
inside
undoubtedly
yezo
was
a
much
colder
country
in
bygone
years
than
it
is
now
and
though
we
can
not
implicitly
rely
on
the
information
given
by
the
ainu
they
are
all
of
one
opinion
in
believing
that
their
country
was
all
ice
and
snow
in
former
days
and
to
give
a
proof
of
it
they
say
why
should
we
be
as
hairy
as
a
bear
if
not
to
keep
the
cold
out
the
japanese
know
the
by
the
name
of
or
the
latter
word
meaning
men
of
the
lakes
but
they
know
nothing
of
their
history
lake
man
is
probably
a
corruption
of
the
ainu
word
a
lake
or
a
swamp
and
it
is
used
by
the
japanese
of
yezo
for
lake
instead
of
the
word
one
fact
still
remains
to
be
explained
namely
who
made
the
pottery
that
is
disinterred
in
almost
every
pit
and
by
the
shores
of
lakes
the
present
ainu
do
not
know
how
to
make
pottery
and
they
have
never
been
known
to
manufacture
anything
of
the
kind
all
ainu
implements
are
made
of
wood
though
of
course
the
more
civilised
tribes
have
now
purchased
iron
or
porcelain
implements
from
the
japanese
the
question
then
is
supposing
that
the
ainu
were
formerly
the
have
they
lost
the
art
of
making
pottery
or
did
the
pottery
belong
to
a
different
race
of
people
illustration
pottery
and
fragments
of
designs
it
seemed
singular
to
me
that
conservative
as
the
ainu
are
of
their
relics
even
allowing
for
its
brittle
nature
no
pottery
of
the
kind
found
in
pits
is
ever
to
be
seen
in
any
ainu
hut
had
they
made
the
pottery
themselves
surely
some
specimens
or
parts
of
specimens
would
have
been
preserved
comparing
facts
we
find
then
that
the
built
their
huts
over
pits
made
pottery
and
used
stone
and
flint
implements
while
the
ainu
have
never
been
known
to
dwell
in
pits
have
never
made
pottery
and
have
always
used
bone
or
bamboo
implements
moreover
ainu
traditions
of
internecine
wars
vague
as
they
are
and
their
designating
the
enemy
by
the
name
of
are
further
proofs
that
the
ainu
themselves
do
not
regard
the
as
their
forefathers
as
then
the
few
facts
collected
tend
to
prove
that
the
ainu
and
the
were
two
distinct
races
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
who
the
latter
really
were
and
what
became
of
them
a
learned
missionary
batchelor
writing
on
this
subject
says
but
i
am
of
opinion
that
these
were
closely
allied
to
the
ainu
in
descent
and
that
the
remains
of
them
may
now
be
seen
in
shikotan
and
other
islands
of
the
kurile
group
the
inhabitants
of
shikotan
are
much
shorter
in
stature
than
the
ainu
of
yezo
they
are
not
so
and
are
said
to
be
a
very
improvident
race
the
ainu
look
upon
the
kurile
islanders
as
the
remnants
of
the
but
this
is
a
mere
opinion
to
be
adopted
or
rejected
at
pleasure
that
they
are
quite
for
live
in
at
the
present
day
before
being
so
certain
as
to
what
he
was
stating
it
would
have
been
well
had
the
writer
of
the
above
lines
visited
the
island
in
question
he
would
not
then
have
committed
so
many
blunders
in
so
few
lines
the
inhabitants
of
shikotan
are
shorter
than
the
ainu
of
yezo
and
i
can
not
give
a
better
proof
of
this
than
by
asking
my
readers
to
compare
the
measurements
which
i
took
while
there
with
the
measurements
of
the
yezo
ainu
the
medium
height
of
the
shikotan
ainu
is
between
inches
and
and
inches
the
medium
height
of
the
yezo
ainu
is
between
inches
and
and
or
exactly
the
same
the
chest
inflated
measures
and
a
half
inches
with
the
shikotan
ainu
and
and
a
half
with
the
yezo
ainu
while
the
spinal
column
is
only
inches
with
the
shikotan
ainu
and
about
and
with
the
yezo
ainu
the
shikotan
ainu
have
the
same
structural
peculiarity
as
the
yezo
ainu
namely
the
length
of
their
arms
which
peculiarity
by
the
way
is
greatly
accentuated
with
them
the
humerus
is
much
longer
than
with
the
yezo
ainu
while
the
ulna
and
radius
are
shorter
the
hand
is
the
same
length
a
shikotan
ainu
with
outstretched
arms
is
generally
the
length
of
one
hand
longer
than
his
own
height
which
is
more
than
is
usually
found
with
the
yezo
ainu
the
medium
foot
is
nine
and
a
half
inches
with
both
ainu
in
the
ainu
the
tibia
is
rather
flattened
at
its
angular
part
but
the
shikotan
ainu
have
a
nearly
circular
tibia
i
do
not
know
of
any
other
existing
race
in
the
world
in
which
such
an
extraordinary
phenomenon
occurs
and
the
tibia
struck
me
also
as
being
extremely
long
while
the
femur
appeared
proportionately
short
however
with
the
exception
that
the
tibia
is
more
circular
than
with
the
ainu
of
yezo
i
could
not
see
any
material
difference
between
them
and
the
other
ainu
as
we
have
already
seen
each
tribe
in
yezo
has
certain
characteristics
which
other
tribes
have
not
each
tribe
has
conformed
its
habits
to
the
climate
of
the
district
in
which
it
lives
as
well
as
to
other
circumstances
and
each
of
these
tribes
has
adopted
a
slightly
different
architecture
for
its
dwellings
but
it
is
plain
that
all
belong
to
the
same
original
race
the
same
might
be
said
of
the
shikotan
ainu
at
this
point
it
is
well
to
explain
that
the
kurile
islands
not
many
years
ago
belonged
to
russia
but
they
were
exchanged
for
the
southern
half
of
sakhalin
then
belonging
to
japan
and
now
form
part
of
the
japanese
empire
the
two
larger
islands
kunashiri
and
etorofu
are
inhabited
mainly
by
ainu
and
a
few
japanese
who
migrate
there
from
yezo
during
the
fishing
season
while
the
island
of
shikotan
is
inhabited
by
sixty
ainu
brought
there
from
the
northern
islands
of
shirajima
or
shimushir
and
urup
leaving
thus
all
the
islands
of
etorofu
uninhabited
of
kunashiri
and
etorofu
i
shall
say
no
more
in
connection
with
the
but
a
few
more
words
on
the
shikotan
inhabitants
may
prove
interesting
especially
as
people
have
been
led
to
believe
that
they
are
the
descendants
of
the
and
not
really
ainu
i
shall
begin
by
saying
that
the
shikotan
people
call
themselves
kurilsky
and
that
they
speak
both
ainu
and
russian
their
features
are
not
very
massive
and
their
cheek
and
temple
bones
slightly
project
they
have
strong
mouths
and
eyes
identical
in
shape
and
colour
with
those
of
the
yezo
ainu
they
are
as
hairy
they
live
by
fishing
and
hunting
they
clothe
themselves
in
skins
and
they
are
fond
of
beads
and
shining
ornaments
their
huts
have
angular
roofs
and
are
built
in
the
same
style
as
those
of
the
yezo
ainu
but
on
a
smaller
scale
the
interiors
are
also
alike
and
equally
dirty
if
not
more
so
the
ainu
huts
at
shikotan
are
sixteen
in
number
and
of
them
is
built
over
a
pit
thus
showing
that
batchelor
was
a
little
rash
when
relying
on
mistaken
information
he
drew
a
conclusion
which
is
not
in
accordance
with
the
facts
one
thing
that
has
misled
most
people
as
regards
these
kurilsky
ainu
is
that
they
were
compelled
to
cut
their
hair
and
shave
their
beards
to
the
superficial
observer
this
naturally
gives
them
a
different
physiognomy
from
that
of
the
yezo
ainu
who
let
their
hair
grow
long
and
have
flowing
beards
milne
who
some
years
ago
visited
the
island
of
shumshu
relates
that
he
saw
there
a
small
group
of
kurilsky
ainu
who
all
included
numbered
their
dress
although
made
of
skins
was
european
in
form
and
the
upper
garment
shaped
like
a
shirt
was
made
of
puffins
with
the
feathers
inside
the
back
was
ornamented
with
the
plumes
of
the
yellow
puffin
and
the
edge
was
trimmed
with
the
men
wore
garments
tied
at
the
waist
with
a
belt
of
hide
their
feet
and
legs
up
to
the
knee
were
covered
with
moccasins
also
made
of
skin
and
their
food
consisted
of
a
few
berries
the
eggs
and
flesh
of
seals
and
other
meat
they
were
few
and
migratory
and
carried
with
them
all
their
property
when
migrating
milne
in
a
paper
contributed
to
the
asiatic
society
of
japan
thinks
that
the
chief
point
in
connection
with
these
people
is
that
they
constructed
houses
by
making
shallow
excavations
in
the
ground
which
were
then
roofed
over
with
turf
and
that
these
excavations
had
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
pits
now
found
further
south
i
believe
however
that
milne
never
saw
them
excavating
these
pits
and
the
fact
that
hardly
two
dozen
people
in
the
extreme
kuriles
having
temporarily
adopted
shallow
excavations
which
they
roofed
over
is
barely
sufficient
proof
that
they
were
and
as
will
be
seen
later
i
had
ample
evidence
afterwards
that
they
were
not
it
is
probable
that
this
wandering
band
owing
to
the
scarcity
or
difficulty
of
procuring
timber
in
those
regions
the
smallness
of
their
canoes
not
permitting
them
to
transport
the
materials
for
structures
from
one
island
to
another
it
is
probable
i
say
that
having
come
upon
pits
already
dug
they
had
roofed
them
over
and
lived
in
them
finding
them
suitable
to
the
severe
climate
when
i
visited
shikotan
september
where
not
only
these
shimushir
people
but
all
the
kurilsky
ainu
numbering
sixty
are
now
collected
and
where
they
have
built
dwellings
in
their
own
style
the
architecture
and
mode
of
construction
were
identical
with
those
of
the
yezo
ainu
and
there
were
pits
whatever
to
their
huts
the
correct
name
and
pronunciation
is
had
they
been
why
should
they
have
so
suddenly
modified
their
habits
as
to
construct
huts
wholly
without
any
reason
for
so
doing
supposing
they
were
actually
and
had
lived
generation
after
generation
in
pits
why
should
they
abandon
this
chief
structural
characteristic
in
a
place
where
the
climate
is
as
severe
as
in
the
islands
they
formerly
inhabited
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
the
kurilsky
ainu
like
all
barbarians
made
the
best
of
what
they
found
in
their
migrations
from
one
island
to
another
and
that
having
found
pits
already
dug
they
had
lived
in
them
simply
for
convenience
and
to
protect
themselves
from
the
cold
the
impossibility
of
constructing
their
own
style
of
dwellings
which
would
have
required
too
much
time
and
a
great
amount
of
timber
and
reeds
two
articles
scarce
in
the
kuriles
may
account
for
their
being
driven
to
occupy
pits
already
dug
but
i
am
certainly
not
inclined
to
admit
that
therefore
the
few
remaining
kurilsky
ainu
are
in
any
way
connected
with
or
related
to
the
i
believe
that
i
have
given
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
this
at
any
rate
i
have
given
such
evidence
as
it
was
in
my
power
to
collect
and
i
have
based
my
statements
on
what
i
actually
saw
and
not
on
what
i
heard
people
say
as
others
have
speculated
on
this
subject
i
shall
now
ask
the
forgiveness
of
the
reader
if
i
am
also
dragged
into
a
little
speculation
as
to
who
the
were
and
whence
they
came
as
i
remarked
at
the
beginning
of
this
chapter
we
find
that
pits
are
more
numerous
as
we
go
in
a
direction
thus
few
are
found
at
hakodate
and
though
none
or
few
have
been
found
along
the
coast
of
yezo
still
flint
pottery
and
stone
adzes
collected
here
and
there
show
us
that
the
had
travelled
along
that
coast
probably
journeying
in
their
canoes
landing
to
hunt
or
to
fight
the
ainu
along
the
coast
the
pits
increase
in
number
as
we
approach
kusuri
and
at
this
place
the
largest
number
of
pits
in
hokkaido
is
found
then
they
are
numerous
all
along
the
coast
as
far
as
nemuro
and
in
the
islands
of
kunashiri
and
etorofu
the
population
must
have
been
large
as
there
are
numerous
pits
throughout
pits
are
found
in
the
smaller
islands
of
the
kurile
group
and
i
believe
also
in
kamschatka
from
nemuro
following
the
of
yezo
we
find
some
along
the
coast
of
yezo
and
none
down
the
west
coast
until
we
reach
the
narrower
part
of
the
island
near
sappro
this
said
we
have
two
points
to
consider
that
the
moved
from
to
that
the
main
bulk
of
the
population
settled
in
etorofu
kunashiri
and
at
kushiro
few
went
further
south
to
settle
all
evidence
tends
to
show
that
they
came
either
from
kamschatka
or
perhaps
more
probably
from
the
aleutian
islands
it
seems
not
improbable
looking
at
the
volcanic
formation
of
the
kurile
group
that
in
bygone
days
yezo
was
joined
to
kamschatka
affording
a
land
passage
to
the
migratory
people
but
this
we
need
not
take
into
consideration
from
what
one
can
gather
of
this
race
the
habits
and
customs
of
the
must
have
had
many
points
in
common
with
the
present
esquimaux
very
likely
their
pits
were
roofed
over
with
a
snow
vault
they
evidently
lived
by
fishing
and
hunting
like
the
esquimaux
and
all
that
we
know
identifies
them
more
with
the
latter
race
than
with
the
ainu
i
believe
that
the
present
aleuts
have
a
striking
resemblance
to
the
esquimaux
and
if
this
were
the
case
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
not
suppose
that
they
in
former
days
inhabited
the
kuriles
part
of
kamschatka
and
the
portion
of
yezo
it
is
a
fact
that
the
esquimaux
formerly
lived
in
corresponding
latitudes
on
the
east
coast
of
america
and
that
they
withdrew
little
by
little
to
the
more
inhospitable
regions
of
the
north
and
the
same
might
have
occurred
here
after
the
ainu
invasion
of
yezo
the
were
apparently
more
civilised
than
their
conquerors
the
ainu
for
they
made
pottery
and
worked
stone
but
owing
to
their
retiring
nature
and
weaker
physique
and
outnumbered
by
the
savage
hairy
people
they
became
extinct
as
to
the
ainu
they
also
are
undoubtedly
a
race
of
the
north
their
music
their
decorations
their
habits
display
characteristics
of
northern
origin
but
the
ainu
as
we
have
seen
from
their
structures
and
customs
were
by
no
means
accustomed
to
so
cold
a
climate
as
their
predecessors
the
in
my
opinion
they
did
not
invade
yezo
from
the
kuriles
but
came
from
the
continent
of
asia
probably
across
siberia
and
descended
as
far
as
sakhalin
island
where
many
ainu
are
still
to
be
found
as
the
resemble
the
esquimaux
the
ainu
have
a
striking
resemblance
in
many
ways
to
the
northmen
of
europe
and
this
is
what
makes
me
suppose
that
they
came
across
the
northern
part
of
the
continent
and
not
from
the
northern
islands
of
the
pacific
they
made
their
way
south
probably
crossing
over
the
la
perouse
strait
and
the
main
contingent
of
them
came
down
the
coast
of
yezo
i
base
this
theory
on
the
fact
that
the
strong
current
which
passes
through
the
la
perouse
strait
from
west
to
east
would
have
made
it
impossible
for
the
ainu
in
their
light
to
navigate
against
it
or
straight
across
from
sakhalin
to
soya
cape
and
in
crossing
they
were
undoubtedly
drifted
far
on
the
coast
probably
landing
near
abashiri
or
shari
another
evidence
which
made
me
think
that
the
ainu
came
from
sakhalin
is
that
all
knew
of
another
island
besides
yezo
which
they
called
krafto
by
which
name
they
designate
sakhalin
of
the
kuriles
no
one
knew
except
those
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
at
one
time
the
ainu
are
said
to
have
inhabited
the
whole
of
japan
as
far
south
as
satsuma
archæologists
are
puzzled
by
the
discovery
in
the
main
island
of
nippon
of
various
which
include
fragments
of
pottery
identical
with
those
attributed
to
the
and
also
of
shell
heaps
which
some
consider
of
ainu
origin
others
as
no
pits
however
have
been
found
near
these
shell
heaps
nor
on
any
part
of
nippon
thus
another
question
is
raised
as
to
who
the
originators
of
these
shell
heaps
and
were
is
it
not
likely
that
as
the
ainu
proceeded
south
they
encountered
the
at
nemuro
and
then
at
kushiro
and
having
easily
defeated
them
forced
some
of
them
to
retreat
in
the
direction
of
the
kuriles
while
the
rest
went
towards
the
south
they
probably
fled
along
the
coastline
in
their
those
who
moved
south
occasionally
landing
to
hunt
or
to
attack
their
pursuers
thus
we
can
account
for
the
occurrence
along
that
coast
of
some
of
their
implements
but
of
no
pits
which
they
were
not
likely
to
dig
in
such
circumstances
having
then
retreated
as
far
south
as
ushongosh
hakodate
and
with
the
conquering
ainu
still
at
their
heels
there
was
nothing
more
natural
than
that
they
should
cross
the
tsugaru
strait
only
a
few
miles
in
width
carrying
with
them
their
and
pottery
the
opposite
coast
of
nippon
can
be
seen
plainly
from
hakodate
the
ainu
crossed
after
them
and
pushing
the
retreating
further
and
further
south
exterminated
them
and
became
the
masters
of
the
whole
of
japan
the
kuriles
and
sakhalin
as
they
were
thus
pursued
by
the
ainu
whom
they
knew
as
a
warlike
people
and
stronger
than
themselves
there
seems
to
me
no
cause
for
wonder
that
the
did
not
dig
any
pits
while
on
the
main
island
of
nippon
first
because
these
pits
would
have
been
the
sure
means
of
bringing
the
ainu
on
their
track
to
their
certain
annihilation
next
because
the
climate
being
a
great
deal
warmer
they
had
no
need
for
them
on
the
other
hand
it
is
more
than
probable
that
the
retreaters
carried
with
them
their
and
pottery
which
constituted
their
treasures
and
without
which
they
could
not
have
prepared
their
food
the
barbarous
ainu
then
came
in
contact
with
the
japanese
at
whose
hands
they
received
the
same
treatment
as
that
which
they
had
inflicted
on
the
little
by
little
the
land
so
easily
conquered
was
lost
again
and
the
conquering
ainu
were
ere
long
in
retreat
towards
the
north
they
were
beaten
and
defeated
by
the
more
civilised
japanese
and
the
few
who
survived
had
to
cross
over
the
tsugaru
strait
back
to
yezo
there
is
not
a
single
ainu
now
to
be
found
in
nippon
with
the
exception
of
a
child
a
whose
mother
was
an
ainu
and
who
lives
about
sixty
miles
south
of
awomori
the
mother
of
this
child
was
the
last
of
her
race
who
was
born
on
and
who
inhabited
the
main
island
of
nippon
ainu
blood
can
be
traced
in
many
of
the
japanese
in
the
northern
part
of
nippon
especially
between
shiranoka
to
awomori
and
also
some
corrupted
ainu
words
are
still
in
use
in
the
dialect
spoken
in
that
part
of
japan
names
of
places
rivers
towns
of
ainu
origin
are
common
all
over
japan
it
was
this
former
occupation
of
japan
by
the
ainu
that
for
some
time
led
people
to
believe
that
the
ainu
were
the
forefathers
of
the
japanese
and
when
pits
were
found
in
yezo
the
same
people
attributed
them
to
the
ainu
and
then
when
mention
was
made
of
the
and
the
they
affixed
this
name
to
the
kurilsky
ainu
whom
they
had
never
seen
nor
studied
i
am
not
prepared
to
say
whether
or
not
traces
of
these
are
to
be
found
in
the
aleutian
islands
as
i
have
not
visited
them
but
it
would
prove
interesting
to
trace
a
connection
between
them
and
some
existing
race
in
case
my
supposition
be
not
correct
though
i
am
sure
that
it
is
nearer
the
mark
than
any
of
the
conjectures
made
by
others
with
regard
either
to
the
ainu
or
the
at
any
rate
as
i
do
not
pretend
to
infallibility
should
my
supposition
be
wrong
the
facts
given
above
will
remain
and
a
more
successful
student
and
investigator
will
be
able
to
work
on
them
with
a
decided
advantage
over
the
writer
who
had
to
start
from
the
very
beginning
and
work
on
information
which
was
more
of
an
obstacle

a

akkeshi
and

the
kutcharo
river
is
of
some
importance
for
though
not
of
great
length
it
is
navigable
by
small
boats
for
nearly
twenty
miles
from
its
mouth
i
left
kushiro
one
morning
and
made
my
way
up
the
river
not
by
boat
but
along
its
banks
on
horseback
so
as
to
get
a
better
idea
of
the
surrounding
country
and
its
inhabitants
at
kushiro
i
left
more
than
half
my
luggage
to
be
sent
down
to
hakodate
by
the
first
ship
that
happened
to
call
and
this
greatly
changed
my
mode
of
travelling
instead
of
two
ponies
one
pony
would
now
be
quite
sufficient
to
carry
my
baggage
and
myself
and
where
ponies
were
not
obtainable
i
could
carry
all
my
paraphernalia
on
my
own
back
with
no
very
great
difficulty
and
in
this
way
i
should
not
be
hindered
on
my
journey
i
daresay
the
baggage
i
was
carrying
now
weighed
about
pounds
it
mostly
consisted
of
painting
materials
and
wooden
panels
on
which
i
usually
paint
my
sketches
when
travelling
as
to
clothes
and
boots
i
was
beginning
to
be
rather
hard
up
no
weaver
work
no
tailor
garments
nor
tanner
hides
can
stand
the
wear
and
tear
of
such
rough
travelling
as
i
had
had
and
the
old
saying
that
a
light
heart
and
a
thin
pair
of
breeches
carry
you
a
long
way
is
most
decidedly
not
to
be
applied
to
anyone
journeying
to
and
fro
on
a
in
yezo
my
coat
and
trousers
were
showing
signs
of
rapid
decay
and
i
thought
with
vain
desire
of
needle
and
thread
buttons
and
hooks
my
boots
were
falling
to
pieces
owing
to
their
continual
immersion
in
salt
water
the
impossibility
of
cleaning
or
greasing
them
added
to
the
original
damage
and
worse
luck
of
all
they
could
not
be
replaced
altogether
what
with
frayed
garments
leaky
boots
a
battered
hat
and
a
general
air
i
was
scarcely
presentable
in
any
society
a
grade
above
that
of
the
hairy
ainu
a
road
has
been
cut
between
kushiro
and
shibetcha
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
but
though
quite
new
it
is
already
out
of
repair
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
it
is
washed
away
entirely
the
japanese
government
does
its
best
to
open
roads
near
the
largest
settlements
but
japanese
officials
do
not
seem
to
understand
that
after
a
road
has
been
made
it
has
to
be
kept
in
repair
the
country
all
along
is
good
and
the
soil
seems
rich
and
fertile
nearly
up
on
the
east
side
of
the
kutcharo
river
are
three
lakes
the
takkobe
the
tori
lake
and
the
shirin
the
tori
is
the
largest
its
length
is
five
miles
its
width
about
one
mile
on
the
southern
shore
of
this
lake
is
a
picturesque
ainu
village
with
its
old
huts
and
close
to
it
is
a
group
of
japanese
houses
the
contrast
between
the
dirty
and
neglected
old
hovels
of
the
ainu
and
the
clean
spruce
and
somewhat
finikin
houses
of
the
japanese
is
very
striking
in
this
difference
we
read
an
epitome
of
the
way
in
which
civilisation
has
travelled
from
primitive
barbarism
the
road
runs
through
dense
forests
but
in
several
places
especially
on
its
highest
level
we
come
to
lovely
views
of
mountain
scenery
towering
over
the
shimmering
water
of
the
underlying
lakes
in
the
evening
i
reached
shibetcha
a
nice
little
place
constructed
on
each
side
of
a
large
road
which
rises
considerably
as
it
goes
through
the
village
the
village
lies
in
a
small
valley
surrounded
by
moderately
high
mountains
and
is
on
the
western
side
of
the
kutcharo
river
which
intersects
the
valley
a
wooden
bridge
and
a
japanese
are
the
two
main
structures
in
the
place
there
are
houses
in
the
village
and
nearly
half
of
them
are
houses
of
the
being
the
principal
at
a
distance
of
miles
from
here
is
a
sulphur
mine
and
the
miners
after
having
amassed
sufficient
money
come
and
squander
it
at
shibetcha
thus
supporting
this
nook
of
demoralization
in
the
wilderness
of
these
mountains
as
the
river
becomes
very
shallow
the
mineral
from
the
sulphur
mine
of
yuzan
was
carried
until
quite
recently
on
as
far
as
here
whence
it
was
brought
down
by
boat
to
kushiro
for
shipment
but
a
small
railway
on
which
only
a
truck
train
is
now
running
once
a
day
from
the
mine
to
shibetcha
has
greatly
simplified
matters
and
increased
the
export
returns
of
the
mine
by
the
kind
permission
of
the
mitsui
company
i
was
allowed
to
travel
on
one
of
the
trucks
no
passenger
carriages
being
provided
and
the
two
and
a
half
hours
journey
was
thus
accomplished
much
more
comfortably
than
if
i
had
ridden
the
miles
on
my
the
railway
took
me
to
the
foot
of
mount
yuzan
and
that
same
afternoon
i
made
the
ascent
of
the
mountain
the
most
valuable
sulphur
deposits
in
japan
are
found
on
this
mountain
the
quantity
of
the
mineral
being
practically
unlimited
the
ascent
was
hard
work
but
it
was
interesting
to
see
the
whence
the
sulphur
is
extracted
and
whence
a
dense
smoke
shoots
out
with
great
force
the
whole
mountain
is
covered
with
thick
layers
of
sulphur
of
very
good
quality
and
when
more
practical
processes
are
employed
for
the
extraction
and
carriage
of
the
mineral
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
sulphur
trade
will
assume
a
very
prominent
place
in
the
exports
of
yezo
dozens
of
men
are
employed
now
to
carry
the
sulphur
from
the
mountain
to
the
railway
but
there
is
work
enough
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
more
all
the
sulphur
is
at
present
carried
on
small
wheelbarrows
which
each
man
slings
on
to
his
shoulders
when
empty
and
he
is
going
up
the
mountain
when
the
sulphur
is
reached
the
workman
sits
down
pulls
out
his
pipe
which
he
fills
from
the
folds
of
his
has
a
quiet
smoke
and
a
good
rest
then
he
slowly
fills
his
wheelbarrow
with
the
blocks
and
comfortably
wheels
it
down
hill
to
the
station
a
considerable
distance
such
a
primitive
fashion
of
carriage
involves
great
loss
of
time
and
a
simple
mechanical
contrivance
by
which
a
large
quantity
of
mineral
could
be
brought
down
at
one
time
would
save
an
enormous
amount
of
labour
and
therefore
expense
a
cable
railway
would
answer
the
purpose
to
perfection
and
the
cost
of
running
the
steam
motor
would
be
insignificant
owing
to
the
amount
of
wood
and
coal
found
within
easy
reach
i
passed
through
a
large
gorge
in
the
mountain
and
finally
reached
the
summit
of
yuzan
walking
on
sulphur
beds
is
like
walking
on
ice
and
many
a
time
in
the
climb
i
landed
on
my
knees
near
the
summit
is
a
huge
pinnacle
of
volcanic
rock
standing
up
perpendicularly
and
of
impossible
access
from
the
foot
of
this
pinnacle
a
lovely
view
of
the
kutcharo
lake
is
obtained
and
it
has
as
a
background
chain
after
chain
of
mountains
beyond
which
are
visible
oakan
and
moyokan
two
volcanic
peaks
respectively
four
thousand
and
three
thousand
four
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
on
moyokan
are
some
hot
springs
and
accumulations
of
sulphur
both
these
peaks
can
be
seen
from
the
coast
on
a
clear
day
a
small
lake
lies
between
moyokan
and
oakan
which
takes
its
name
from
the
latter
mountain
and
finds
an
outlet
in
the
oakan
river
the
oakan
joins
the
kutcharo
river
not
far
from
the
sea
illustration
kutcharo
lake
from
mount
yuzan
the
descent
was
easier
than
the
ascent
and
i
put
up
at
a
small
the
only
one
in
the
place
the
landlord
promised
to
get
me
a
good
pony
early
the
next
morning
but
like
a
true
japanese
he
did
not
keep
his
promise
he
called
me
at
saying
that
the
pony
would
be
ready
in
a
few
minutes
and
at
the
quadruped
had
not
put
in
an
appearance
and
after
numberless
excuses
compliments
bows
and
lies
the
landlord
acknowledged
that
no
ponies
were
to
be
had
i
gave
my
luggage
to
a
railway
who
undertook
to
bring
it
back
to
shibetcha
and
i
started
on
foot
for
lake
kutcharo
from
yuzan
a
track
across
the
mountains
goes
due
north
to
abashiri
on
the
coast
i
went
in
a
direction
and
as
on
the
previous
day
from
the
summit
of
yuzan
i
had
noted
the
position
of
lake
kutcharo
i
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
my
way
there
in
fact
i
came
upon
a
small
ainu
track
leading
to
it
a
delightful
walk
of
ten
miles
in
the
forest
took
me
to
the
ainu
village
of
kutcharo
on
the
borders
of
the
lake
of
the
same
name
the
village
is
a
miserable
one
it
differs
from
all
other
ainu
villages
in
its
huts
which
have
semicircular
roofs
instead
of
angular
ones
as
is
the
case
with
the
ainu
of
volcano
bay
and
of
the
saru
and
tokachi
rivers
i
entered
some
of
the
huts
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
surrounded
by
the
small
population
i
daresay
about
twenty
souls
all
included
whom
i
led
out
into
the
open
air
to
see
what
they
were
like
they
appeared
to
me
smaller
than
other
ainu
and
their
bones
were
less
massive
they
were
not
so
hairy
and
more
inclined
to
baldness
their
garments
were
wretched
and
resembled
those
worn
by
the
tokachi
ainu
namely
a
few
rags
held
together
one
could
scarcely
say
how
women
were
tattooed
on
their
lips
and
arms
but
less
extensively
than
are
those
of
other
tribes
and
the
tattooing
was
not
so
accurately
done
other
ainu
whom
i
met
in
the
forest
in
the
neighbourhood
of
this
village
bore
the
same
characteristics
and
everyone
seemed
to
be
curiously
melancholy
and
depressed
an
ainu
existence
is
certainly
not
one
ideal
of
comfort
and
hilarity
but
their
gloom
and
melancholy
seem
to
me
to
be
purely
racial
and
congenital
the
lake
kutcharo
is
very
large
too
large
to
be
seen
to
advantage
from
its
borders
as
one
can
see
only
parts
and
not
the
whole
of
it
at
once
it
has
a
pretty
island
in
the
centre
and
on
the
west
side
is
a
peninsula
projecting
almost
as
far
as
the
island
on
this
peninsula
a
small
active
geyser
is
found
which
rises
to
a
height
of
about
twelve
feet
and
acts
spasmodically
the
high
mountains
which
surround
the
lake
would
make
the
latter
a
pleasant
summer
resort
were
the
place
within
the
circle
of
civilisation
the
scenery
is
very
similar
to
that
of
norway
or
the
scotch
lakes
the
kutcharo
river
as
can
be
seen
on
the
map
is
an
outlet
of
the
lake
kutcharo
into
which
the
waters
of
the
latter
discharge
themselves
a
few
hundred
yards
west
of
the
ainu
village
illustration
sulphur
mine
an
ainu
pointed
out
to
me
the
track
leading
to
tetcha
or
tetchkanga
and
i
directed
my
steps
in
that
direction
the
ainu
having
informed
me
that
it
was
very
far
and
that
i
could
only
reach
it
at
night
i
crossed
the
stream
in
a
and
found
the
track
on
the
other
side
i
walked
fast
for
the
most
part
through
a
country
and
at
about
sunset
i
reached
tetcha
the
distance
from
kutcharo
i
should
think
is
about
ten
or
twelve
miles
tetcha
is
an
ainu
village
near
which
a
few
japanese
houses
have
been
built
the
kutcharo
river
intersects
it
and
the
sulphur
train
from
yuzan
stops
here
to
take
water
on
its
way
to
shibetcha
the
train
had
gone
through
some
hours
previously
and
i
was
left
the
alternative
of
walking
on
to
shibetcha
twenty
miles
further
or
of
sleeping
at
tetcha
i
had
walked
twenty
or
miles
already
that
day
and
i
felt
in
very
good
form
i
knew
that
it
would
be
full
moon
that
night
and
walking
through
a
forest
by
moonlight
has
always
had
a
great
charm
for
me
watching
the
shadows
with
their
thousand
different
fantastic
forms
running
in
and
out
through
the
trees
and
playing
round
them
has
the
same
weird
fascination
for
me
as
one
of
tieck
tales
or
the
suggestive
music
of
an
æolian
harp
some
of
the
ainu
and
a
jap
entreated
me
not
to
attempt
to
cross
the
forest
at
night
for
wolves
and
bears
were
numerous
they
said
and
in
all
probability
i
should
be
attacked
by
them
this
last
announcement
which
i
was
destined
to
hear
every
day
in
yezo
and
which
of
course
i
did
not
believe
decided
me
to
go
and
i
started
but
cried
after
me
the
astonished
japanese
micci
you
do
not
know
the
way
sayonara
it
little
matters
was
my
reply
and
i
left
him
standing
there
perplexed
looking
after
me
as
if
i
had
been
a
phenomenon
the
japanese
in
yezo
and
the
ainu
never
on
any
account
travel
far
at
night
and
as
for
going
through
a
forest
alone
unprotected
and
without
knowing
the
way
they
evidently
regarded
it
as
something
more
reprehensible
than
folly
two
days
previously
when
in
the
train
i
had
noticed
that
the
railway
described
a
curve
several
miles
long
and
i
knew
then
that
by
cutting
across
i
could
considerably
shorten
my
way
when
i
entered
the
forest
the
sun
with
its
last
rays
was
casting
warm
tints
on
the
tops
of
the
everything
was
still
and
only
now
and
then
some
huge
owl
awakened
by
the
noise
of
my
steps
from
its
long
sleep
would
fly
away
starting
off
on
its
night
peregrinations
and
depredations
i
walked
mile
after
mile
and
finally
struck
the
rails
again
on
a
white
post
i
saw
a
cipher
in
chinese
characters
which
brought
me
back
to
the
reality
that
i
was
still
seventeen
miles
away
from
shibetcha
i
followed
the
line
of
rail
as
closely
as
i
could
and
late
at
night
i
reached
shibetcha
i
roused
the
people
at
the
and
having
eaten
some
salmon
and
water
soup
i
retired
to
my
between
which
it
is
useless
to
say
i
slept
well
i
had
walked
odd
miles
that
day
and
it
had
been
a
pleasant
change
from
the
continuous
riding
on
the
next
day
i
rode
down
to
the
coast
to
the
bay
of
akkeshi
about
miles
east
of
kushiro
the
road
is
very
good
all
the
way
and
has
on
each
side
woods
of
oak
and
pine
trees
the
traffic
on
it
is
at
present
very
small
and
the
only
living
creatures
i
saw
during
the
or
thirty
miles
were
a
beautiful
red
fox
and
a
number
of
japanese
convicts
led
by
a
policeman
these
were
dressed
in
red
trousers
and
a
short
red
coat
made
of
coarse
material
they
were
walking
in
a
row
and
they
were
chained
two
by
two
and
moreover
a
long
rope
joined
the
chain
of
each
couple
to
that
of
the
next
so
that
all
couples
were
tied
together
the
end
of
this
rope
was
held
by
the
policeman
some
of
them
wore
large
hats
entirely
covering
their
face
others
wore
no
hat
at
all
and
had
their
head
shaved
in
a
peculiar
manner
they
were
mostly
but
a
few
wore
straw
sandals
the
government
wisely
makes
use
of
these
convicts
in
opening
roads
and
other
public
works
and
after
their
term
of
punishment
is
expired
these
men
almost
invariably
become
fishermen
a
great
part
of
the
japanese
population
of
yezo
is
composed
of
exiles
and
in
other
words
yezo
is
nothing
more
or
less
to
japan
than
what
australia
was
to
england
some
years
ago
nearing
the
coast
i
passed
the
tonden
of
hondemura
a
colonial
militia
farming
settlement
a
long
line
of
new
houses
all
exactly
alike
in
shape
and
size
and
built
at
intervals
stretches
on
each
side
of
the
wide
road
each
of
these
houses
is
inhabited
by
a
man
who
has
served
his
time
as
a
soldier
and
who
has
now
his
family
about
him
and
does
work
as
a
farmer
in
this
settlement
assigned
to
him
these
tondens
were
established
by
the
government
and
i
believe
that
the
give
fairly
good
results
in
the
zeal
and
industry
with
which
they
cultivate
the
land
and
the
honesty
and
morality
of
their
lives
i
saw
most
of
them
occupied
in
stubbing
up
the
scrub
and
tearing
or
cutting
down
the
trees
burning
the
more
worthless
parts
but
it
will
be
some
years
yet
before
they
have
cleared
an
area
of
cultivable
land
sufficiently
large
for
profit
as
the
country
is
very
thickly
wooded
in
that
neighbourhood
soon
after
i
had
passed
the
settlement
going
down
a
steep
hill
i
came
upon
a
small
and
dirty
village
and
ultimately
reached
the
seashore
the
distance
from
shibetcha
is
thirty
miles
and
the
riding
was
beginning
to
be
unpleasant
owing
to
the
gathering
darkness
which
made
my
pony
shy
at
everything
it
passed
at
the
mouth
of
the
pehambe
ushi
river
i
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
my
pony
on
the
which
was
to
take
me
across
the
mouth
of
the
lagoon
to
akkeshi
several
drunken
fishermen
came
on
board
and
were
disagreeably
noisy
one
of
these
fellows
had
a
pony
which
he
tied
to
mine
when
on
board
the
ferry
was
to
take
us
across
the
entrance
of
the
akkeshi
lagoon
and
it
was
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
we
reached
the
opposite
shore
when
we
were
still
nearly
twenty
feet
from
my
pony
frightened
at
the
cries
of
the
drunken
crowd
jumped
overboard
carrying
with
him
his
companion
steed
the
sudden
shock
and
lurch
of
the
boat
knocked
down
everybody
on
board
and
nearly
capsized
us
as
it
was
we
shipped
a
lot
of
water
the
ponies
found
the
water
deeper
than
they
expected
and
they
had
to
swim
for
it
having
landed
before
he
came
ashore
i
recaptured
mine
gave
him
a
sound
thrashing
and
rode
on
to
akkeshi
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
akkeshi
lies
at
the
side
of
the
large
bay
which
goes
by
the
same
name
and
which
by
the
way
is
probably
one
of
the
best
anchorages
on
the
south
coast
of
yezo
the
mouth
of
the
bay
is
to
the
southward
it
extends
seven
miles
in
a
northerly
direction
and
is
about
six
miles
wide
in
its
widest
part
the
bay
is
prolonged
further
inland
by
a
large
lagoon
called
which
contains
many
shoals
and
low
islands
near
which
are
beds
of
oysters
of
enormous
size
the
shells
of
some
measuring
as
much
as
eighteen
inches
in
length
the
by
whom
this
district
was
formerly
thickly
populated
seem
to
have
relished
this
diet
as
we
find
thick
beds
of
discarded
shells
on
the
top
of
some
of
the
lower
hills
and
in
many
places
especially
in
the
vicinity
of
pits
these
shell
heaps
are
similar
to
those
found
on
the
main
island
of
nippon
and
attributed
to
the
ainu
chapter
ix
the
country
round
the
bay
and
the
lagoon
forms
a
high
land
or
plateau
between
two
hundred
and
three
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
and
the
higher
ground
is
thickly
wooded
thus
supplying
akkeshi
with
abundance
of
timber
mostly
of
evergreen
trees
as
todo
and
two
spruces
common
in
other
parts
of
yezo
as
well
with
its
good
harbour
its
large
export
of
oysters
salmon
herrings
and
seaweed
besides
its
and
the
quantity
of
good
timber
easily
cut
and
transported
down
the
lagoon
and
across
the
bay
for
shipment
it
is
not
surprising
that
akkeshi
has
become
after
hakodate
the
most
important
centre
on
the
southern
coast
it
is
nearly
half
as
large
again
as
kushiro
and
has
as
many
as
nine
hundred
japanese
houses
besides
sixty
or
seventy
ainu
huts
the
ainu
were
formerly
extremely
numerous
in
this
district
but
few
of
them
are
left
now
and
those
few
are
indeed
poor
specimens
of
their
race
they
have
nearly
all
become
bald
and
they
seem
to
suffer
very
severely
from
rheumatism
thick
fogs
are
very
prevalent
along
the
coast
and
it
is
but
seldom
that
one
can
obtain
a
view
of
the
whole
bay
these
fogs
naturally
render
navigation
unsafe
and
are
one
of
the
great
drawbacks
to
the
prosperity
of
the
place
however
our
good
londoners
could
tell
us
that
greater
evils
than
fogs
can
exist
i
have
no
doubt
that
at
some
future
date
we
shall
hear
of
akkeshi
as
being
the
most
important
port
in
yezo
when
a
railway
to
join
it
to
shibetcha
shall
have
been
constructed
the
sulphur
of
mount
yuzan
will
probably
then
be
taken
direct
to
this
place
instead
of
kushiro
owing

the

bay
is
also
interesting
from
a
picturesque
point
of
view
when
fogs
give
one
a
chance
of
seeing
the
surrounding
scenery
some
fine
headlands
are
found
near
the
town
of
akkeshi

also
on

side
of

this
is
especially
true
of
the
larger
island
of
daikuku
which
rises
at
a
considerable
height
above
the
sea
forming
majestic
cliffs
beautiful
in
shape

colour
on
which
myriads
of
seagulls
albatrosses

penguins
have
chosen
their
abode

in

almost
untrodden
and
picturesque
cliffs
a
safe
place

to

they
live
undisturbed

for
the

make
the

tremble
and

to
pieces

only
meet
with
a
blithesome
welcome
from

station
nemuro
and
its
people
the
road
in
the
proximity
of
akkeshi
was
extremely
muddy
and
slippery
owing
to
the
continuous
fogs
and
rain
a
north
wind
was
blowing
hard
the
day
i
left
for
kiritap
and
it
drove
the
mist
and
drizzly
rain
right
through
one
skin
into
one
bones
the
fogs
which
are
prevalent
all
along
the
coast
seem
to
excel
between
akkeshi
and
kiritap
so
much
so
that
the
japanese
in
the
neighbourhood
make
them
answerable
for
their
baldness
and
the
local
ainu
say
they
are
so
scantily
hirsute
because
of
the
everlasting
dampness
in
which
they
live
they
clinch
their
argument
by
reminding
you
that
when
their
forefathers
came
to
this
part
of
the
coast
they
were
as
hairy
as
the
bear
so
what
can
have
caused
their
own
comparative
smoothness
but
these
everlasting
fogs
i
believe
that
to
a
great
extent
they
are
right
for
when
after
a
day
wet
ride
i
have
sat
near
a
fire
even
for
some
hours
i
have
felt
as
if
my
skin
were
soaking
with
wet
as
if
i
had
been
too
long
in
a
bath
and
neither
rubbing
with
cotton
towels
nor
the
warmth
of
the
fire
seemed
thoroughly
to
dry
it
and
perhaps
such
an
extraordinary
dampness
constantly
saturating
the
pores
of
the
skin
may
have
an
injurious
effect
upon
the
hair
and
cause
it
to
decay
and
fall
off
it
was
in
a
thick
fog
like
this
that
i
had
to
find
my
way
to
riruran
the
next
horse
station
about
eight
miles
further
east
the
road
soon
became
a
mere
track
running
through
an
undulating
country
chiefly
pasture
land
as
luck
would
have
it
i
had
hired
a
pony
which
belonged
to
the
riruran
station
and
the
beast
was
as
anxious
to
get
there
as
i
was
he
knew
the
way
and
i
did
not
so
i
let
him
guide
me
now
and
then
when
the
wind
blew
with
increased
strength
the
fog
lifted
for
a
few
minutes
and
disclosed
some
pretty
bits
of
landscape
the
country
all
around
was
grassy
with
the
familiar
hills
in
the
background
it
somewhat
resembled
the
slopes
and
high
lands
of
cornwall
without
however
the
herds
of
sheep
and
cattle
which
in
our
country
are
connected
with
green
fields
without
the
trim
fences
and

hill
after

was

as
yet

with

all

of
vigorous
and

are
things
that
an
intending
traveller
to
yezo
will
miss
everywhere
are
solitude
and
monotony
still
even
solitude
and
monotony
are
not
always
to
be
abhorred
and
if
they
have
their
drawbacks
they
also
have
their
advantages
you
can
go
undisturbed
for

after

you
can

you
can

you
can
sing
you
can
keep
to
the
track
or
go
across
country
you
can
go
fast
or
slow
and
there
is
no
one
to
object
to
obstruct
or
to
comment
you
breathe
air
that
no
one
has
breathed
before
and
you
quench
your
thirst
in
a
limpid
stream
unpolluted
by
sewage
chemical
refuse
or
poisonous
you
lead
a
simple
life
and
what
is
more
an
independent
life
many
a
time
when
i
woke
up
to
the
real
state
of
my
new
condition
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
our
civilised
conceptions
of
what
constitutes
a
free
man
in
a
free
country
viz
that
he
can
have
a
voice
in
choosing
which
of
two
men
shall
be
sent
as
a
member
to
parliament
absorbed
now
in
my
own
thoughts
on
many
subjects
and
now
in
gazing
at
the
monotonous
scenes
which
as
if
reflected
from
a
suddenly
appeared
and
as
suddenly
faded
away
i
had
not
seen
how
far
my
pony
had
hurried
on
when
rapidly
descending
a
steep
hill
i
discerned
through
the
grey
fog
a
solitary
shed
in
the
small
valley
below
the
neighing
of
my
steed
responded
to
by
the
neighing
of
his
compatriots
in
the
valley
told
me
that
i
had
reached
the
horse
station
of
riruran
and
a
few
minutes
later
my
baggage
and
were
removed
from
my
steaming
quadruped
and
a
fresh
animal
was
burdened
with
my
possessions
these
horse
stations
generally
consist
of
one
shed
in
which
the
owner
and
his
family
live
near
it
is
a
rough
enclosure
formed
of
branches
and
trunks
of
trees
laid
down
horizontally
and
strengthened
at
intervals
by
poles
stuck
in
the
ground
the
ponies
are
kept
in
this
enclosure
during
the
day
but
are
let
loose
at
sunset
when
they
go
for
their
food
wherever
they
can
get
it
generally
on
the
near
hills
early
in
the
morning
one
or
two
ainu
employed
in
the
stations
start
off
to
recapture
the
ponies
and
after
a
struggle
bring
back
the
herd
to
the
paddock
my
readers
who
may
not
be
well
acquainted
with
the
habits
of
horses
will
wonder
that
the
ponies
once
free
in
an
unenclosed
country
do
not
bolt
away
altogether
inland
thus
making
it
impossible
to
recapture
them
and
moreover
these
readers
will
think
what
a
difficult
task
it
must
be
for
the
ainu
horsemen
to
recover
all
the
ponies
each
one
of
which
they
probably
imagine
has
bolted
in
an
independent
and
different
direction
this
is
not
the
case
when
a
herd
of
ponies
is
let
loose
they
invariably
all
go
together
in
one
direction
generally
following
those
of
the
older
animals
which
have
bells
hanging
to
their
necks
when
they
come
to
a
proper
they
all
graze
within
a
few
yards
of
one
another
and
the
chances
are
that
the
herd
will
not
go
a
step
further
than
is
necessary
as
they
are
terribly
afraid
of
bears
their
most
dreaded
enemy
by
which
they
well
know
the
more
distant
hills
are
infested
when
their
hunger
is
satisfied
they
shoulder
up
together
and
form
a
circle
in
the
centre
of
which
the
young
colts
are
placed
these
being
thus
well
protected
from
bears
who
would
find
a
sturdy
resistance
in
the
hind
hoofs
of
the
outstanding
guard
should
they
come
to
close
quarters
the
ainu
are
good
trackers
and
have
little
difficulty
in
finding
in
which
direction
the
herd
has
moved
when
this
preliminary
is
ascertained
the
horseman
mounted
on
a
swift
pony
which
he
has
taken
good
care
to
keep
behind
starts
from
the
station
about
an
hour
before
sunrise
so
as
to
allow
himself
ample
time
to
reach
the
herd
before
the
sun
is
up
he
finds
the
ponies
in
this
circular
position
of
defence
with
a
long
stick
he
breaks
their
ranks
and
by
shouting
and
wildly
galloping
to
and
fro
drives
them
on
in
front
till
the
station
and
the
pen
are
reached
when
they
have
all
entered
the
latter
a
heavy
wooden
bar
is
rested
on
two
biforked
poles
one
on
each
side
of
the
entrance
thus
barring
their
way
out
and
there
they
are
kept
all
day
waiting
for
such
native
travellers
or
traders
as
may
require
their
services
along
the
coast
most
of
the
stations
are
owned
by
japanese
and
by
ainu
some
have
large
numbers
of
ponies
some
only
a
few
according
to
the
wants
of
the
neighbourhood
the
average
market
value
of
a
beast
is
between
five
and
ten
or
about
fifteen
to
thirty
shillings
in
english
currency
at
stations
where
the
ponies
are
but
little
worked
good
animals
can
sometimes
be
obtained
for
a
small
sum
of
money
but
at
stations
near
large
settlements
where
trade
with
other
villages
is
carried
on
entirely
by
they
are
mostly
sorry
beasts
with
their
backs
one
mass
of
sores
produced
by
the
friction
of
the
rough
moreover
the
cruel
habit
of
letting
colts
follow
mares
for
long
distances
sometimes
forty
or
fifty
miles
is
as
painful
a
sight
to
witness
as
it
is
injurious
to
the
breed
the
yezo
ponies
are
characterised
by
their
long
hair
and
mane
they
are
short
sturdy
punchy
brutes
not
more
than
ten
or
twelve
hands
high
with
a
rather
large
and
massive
head
and
thick
crooked
legs
they
are
by
no
means
animals
nor
are
they
well
groomed
in
fact
they
are
not
groomed
at
all
but
they
serve
capitally
for
the
rough
tracks
and
precipitous
wastes
of
hokkaido
they
have
none
of
the
good
qualities
we
require
in
our
horses
but
they
possess
others
which
fit
them
for
the
country
they
are
in
their
enormous
power
of
endurance
and
the
wonderful
way
in
which
they
can
go
over
the
steepest
tracks
almost
unclimbable
on
foot
their
sure
step
when
going
along
precipices
and
the
marvellous
manner
in
which
they
pick
their
way
over
rocky
coasts
which
the
waves
would
seem
to
make
impassable
and
where
none
of
our
good
horses
could
go
without
breaking
their
legs
are
all
endowments
which
i
feel
bound
to
quote
in
honour
of
the
yezo
ponies
they
are
not
shod
and
they
can
hardly
be
called
trained
indeed
if
a
traveller
be
a
good
rider
it
is
advisable
to
obtain
a
perfectly
unbroken
animal
as
from
my
own
personal
experience
i
can
say
that
though
the
riding
was
a
little
more
exciting
i
could
invariably
make
better
time
with
a
totally
unbroken
beast
than
with
one
of
the
quiet
ponies
which
needed
any
amount
of
thrashing
to
make
him
go
illustration
ainu
bits
a
curious
method
is
adopted
for
directing
the
animal
it
is
as
simple
as
it
is
ingenious
the
necessary
bit
by
which
we
control
our
horses
is
dispensed
with
and
it
is
replaced
by
two
wooden
wands
about
twelve
inches
long
and
two
inches
wide
tied
together
at
one
end
allowing
a
distance
of
three
inches
between
them
in
the
middle
of
these
wands
a
rope
is
passed
which
goes
over
the
pony
head
behind
its
ears
while
the
wands
themselves
thus
supported
by
it
rest
one
on
each
side
of
the
pony
nose
another
rope
five
or
six
feet
in
length
and
acting
as
a
rein
is
fastened
at
the
lower
end
of
one
of
the
wands
and
passes
through
a
hole
in
the
other
thus
allowing
this
simple
contrivance
based
on
the
lever
principle
to
be
worked
exactly
in
the
same
way
as
a
the
pony
nose
being
the
nut
the
disadvantage
of
the
system
is
that
having
only
one
rein
this
has
to
be
passed
over
the
pony
head
each
time
one
wishes
to
turn
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
as
by
pulling
the
rope
hard
and
thus
squeezing
the
animal
nose
its
head
is
turned
in
the
direction
in
which
it
is
pulled
and
it
is
soon
taught
that
this
is
the
way
it
must
go
furthermore
should
the
pony
bolt
it
can
be
stopped
by
pulling
its
head
close
to
its
haunches
thereby
making
it
impossible
to
continue
its
race
in
the
latter
case
it
often
happens
especially
with
an
untrained
pony
that
it
will
spin
round
trying
to
stretch
its
twisted
neck
by
pushing
its
head
away
from
the
side
of
its
body
and
the
result
is
generally
a
bad
fall
of
horse
and
rider
another
thing
of
which
one
ought
to
be
careful
is
to
keep
one
legs
out
of
the
reach
of
the
brute
teeth
for
it
is
not
infrequent
that
instead
of
the
man
punishing
the
animal
the
animal
revenges
itself
on
the
man
and
the
incautious
traveller
realises
sydney
smith
position
and
finds
that
to
a
yezo
pony
as
well
as
to
an
english
all
flesh
is
grass
from
riruran
for
about
fifteen
miles
the
way
is
merely
a
mountain
track
and
i
dare
say
that
in
fine
weather
the
scenery
along
it
is
picturesque
unfortunately
when
i
went
through
the
fog
had
become
more
and
more
intense
and
i
saw
very
little
of
the
landscape
at
places
the
track
led
down
to
the
sea
and
then
mounted
up
again
over
cliffs
and
high
lands
as
the
mist
which
came
in
gusts
and
waves
deepened
or
lightened
in
intensity
the
rugged
precipitous
rocks
formed
mostly
of
conglomerate
sandstone
and
breccia
took
all
sorts
of
fantastic
forms
along
the
coast
were
many
ainu
huts
inhabited
by
and
by
japanese
the
ainu
were
once
very
numerous
in
this
district
but
few
of
them
are
to
be
found
now
the
few
remaining
ones
have
yielded
to
the
more
civilised
japanese
and
have
become
their
servants
they
are
used
as
menials
in
most
of
the
fishing
stations
always
acting
under
the
directions
of
japanese
masters
very
frequently
they
are
employed
as
tenders
of
horses
and
in
some
places
as
guides
for
traders
and
travellers
from
one
station
to
another
not
far
from
riruran
the
mouths
of
two
lagoons
have
to
be
crossed
the
larger
of
which
is
called
or
lake
in
a
grassy
plain
cranes
swans
and
ducks
are
numerous
in
these
lagoons
the
track
continues
mostly
over
cliffs
and
mountains
till
birvase
a
small
village
of
seaweed
gatherers
is
reached
and
the
next
two
and
a
half
miles
are
along
a
sandy
beach
as
far
as
hammanaka
a
short
bridge
joins
this
place
to
the
island
of
kiritap
which
is
separated
from
the
mainland
by
a
channel
only
a
few
feet
wide
towards
the
evening
the
fog
lifted
and
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
village
the
ponies
of
the
kiritap
village
had
just
been
let
loose
and
were
running
over
the
small
wooden
bridge
with
great
clamour
the
houses
which
number
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
are
all
poor
and
dirty
there
is
a
main
street
and
most
of
the
houses
are
on
each
side
of
it
the
people
are
fishermen
seaweed
gatherers
and
small
traders
for
hammanaka
bay
being
a
good
anchorage
for
junks
and
small
craft
under
the
lee
of
kiritap
island
is
a
place
of
some
importance
for
its
export
trade
of
seaweeds
and
herring
guano
these
products
being
sent
down
to
hakodate
if
a
few
ainu
have
adopted
the
japanese
language
clothes
and
customs
there
are
also
many
japanese
who
have
taken
up
the
ainu
language
and
ways
i
noticed
this
more
particularly
in
this
district
where
the
ainu
have
almost
entirely
disappeared
the
older
japanese
and
many
of
the
younger
folks
have
ainu
features
and
not
only
have
they
adopted
a
great
number
of
ainu
words
but
when
talking
japanese
they
speak
it
with
the
peculiar
intonation
and
accent
pertaining
to
the
ainu
this
is
not
surprising
nor
yet
peculiar
to
the
japanese
or
the
chinese
for
we
find
that
almost
all
english
residents
in
chinese
ports
adopt
many
of
the
words
of
our
brothers
and
have
thus
formed
a
kind
of
local
english
besides
the
a
corruption
of
business
english
which
almost
constitutes
a
language
of
its
own
the
ainu
like
the
scotch
or
the
french
give
a
rolling
sound
to
the
thus
for
instance
if
i
had
written
the
word
riruran
as
it
is
pronounced
i
should
have
spelt
it
rrirrurran
then
the
ainu
almost
sing
their
words
the
women
in
a
falsetto
voice
ending
in
a
singularly
mournful
kind
of
cadenza
on
his
return
from
a
journey
a
hunt
or
a
fishing
expedition
the
ainu
squats
down
in
his
hut
and
after
the
conventional
introductory
ceremony
of
rubbing
the
palms
of
his
hands
together
and
then
repeatedly
stroking
his
hair
and
beard
proceeds
to
relate
the
adventures
that
have
befallen
him
during
his
absence
this
he
does
by
singing
out
his
story
in
a
sort
of
monotone
or
sometimes
chanting
it
when
conversing
with
japanese
the
ainu
have
slightly
modified
this
habit
which
gave
rise
to
much
mirth
to
the
sons
of
the
mikado
empire
however
like
all
people
who
are
ready
to
laugh
at
everything
novel
the
local
japanese
have
now
themselves
fallen
into
that
same
manner
of
speaking
which
after
all
has
its
charms
as
it
is
rather
sentimental
in
spirit
and
so
far
pleasant
to
the
ear
what
is
more
they
have
also
acquired
the
slow
ways
of
the
ainu
all
along
the
beach
between
hammanaka
and
hattaushi
a
distance
of
nearly
twenty
miles
there
are
fishermen
and
seaweed
gatherers
huts
but
none
of
them
is
inhabited
by
ainu
men
women
and
children
are
all
occupied
in
the
seaweed
gathering
industry
and
it
is
when
the
sea
is
stormy
that
the
largest
quantity
of
kelp
is
collected
the
numerous
reefs
and
rocks
all
along
the
afford
suitable
ground
and
bottom
for
its
growth
and
production
and
during
a
stormy
sea
quantities
of
kelp
float
on
the
breaking
waves
to
be
finally
thrown
on
shore
the
industrious
gatherers
seldom
wait
for
this
jetsam
as
the
long
weeds
after
they
are
washed
off
the
rock
and
before
they
are
finally
swept
on
shore
are
apt
to
be
damaged
by
the
waves
and
are
therefore
of
less
value
for
the
export
market
than
when
long
and
fresh
wherefore
each
gatherer
provides
himself
with
a
long
pole
or
hook
and
from
morning
till
night
these
toilers
of
the
sea
can
be
seen
running
to
and
fro
in
and
out
of
the
waves
dragging
bunches
of
long
seaweeds
which
are
then
carefully
disentangled
stretched
on
the
sands
to
dry
and
after
several
days
of
exposure
are
packed
for
the
market
some
huge
cliffs
towering
over
the
sandy
beach
make
the
track
interesting
and
here
and
there
scattered
in
the
hammanaka
bay
are
some
before
reaching
the
single
shed
of
hattaushi
the
following
twelve
miles
were
on
an
extremely
bad
track
partly
over
steep
hills
and
partly
on
tiresome
soft
sand
then
i
arrived
at
otchishi
without
exception
the
loveliest
little
spot
in
yezo
it
lies
in
the
centre
of
a
small
bay
on
the
two
sides
of
which
are
magnificent
headlands
with
precipitous
cliffs
and
rocks
of
volcanic
formation
on
a
pretty
bit
of
green
grass
in
the
foreground
only
a
few
feet
above
the
were
a
shed
and
a
storehouse
a
reef
and
shallow
water
closed
the
entrance
of
the
bay
to
the
foaming
waves
of
the
pacific
in
the
sheltered
water
which
was
as
smooth
as
a
mirror
the
dark
rich
colour
of
the
overhanging
rocks
caressed
by
the
last
warm
rays
of
the
dying
sun
was
reflected
with
absolute
fidelity
and
almost
increased
loveliness
a
cold
whitish
sky
and
the
breaking
on
the
reef
completed
the
of
that
lovely
scene
and
it
was
with
great
regret
after
having
attempted
a
sketch
that
i
was
told
my
horse
was
ready
and
i
had
to
leave
this
poetical
and
exquisite
scene
on
the
slight
elevations
near
otchishi
and
in
the
valley
pits
are
still
to
be
seen
showing
that
the
were
once
numerous
in
this
district
they
are
found
both
along
the
coast
as
well
as
slightly
inland
by
the
side
of
small
rivers
and
on
the
shores
of
the
saruffu
lagoon
a
road
begins
at
otchishi
and
goes
on
to
nemuro
at
first
it
runs
over
hilly
ground
and
through
an
country
then
through
thick
forests
of
spruce
trees
the
trees
standing
very
close
together
about
four
miles
from
nemuro
a
military
settlement
hanasaki
similar
to
the
one
on
the
road
has
been
established
by
the
japanese
government
here
again
i
was
struck
by
the
difficulty
and
the
amount
of
labour
involved
in
clearing
the
trees
off
the
ground
it
will
take
many
years
before
the
industrious
farmers
will
have
any
return
for
their
hard
labour
i
do
not
know
what
the
object
of
the
japanese
government
may
have
been
in
starting
these
two
militia
settlements
in
spots
so
unfit
for
cultivation
but
it
seems
a
great
pity
to
see
the
tokachi
region
which
has
all
the
requisites
for
successful
agriculture
quite
deserted
while
hundreds
of
men
are
wasting
their
strength
and
time
at
other
places
where
it
will
take
several
years
to
open
enough
ground
for
even
a
past
the
long
row
of
houses
at
hanasaki
the
road
descends
gently
and
i
arrived
at
nemuro
a
thriving
place
of
about
fifteen
hundred
houses
on
the
coast
of
the
peninsula
ending
at
cape
noshafu
the
general
elevation
of
the
plateau
is
between
sixty
and
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
above
the
and
the
high
land
is
covered
with
undergrowth
and
stunted
trees
such
as
scrub
bamboo
oak
birch
and
alder
the
east
winds
and
fogs
no
doubt
preventing
the
latter
from
attaining
a
larger
growth
some
low
islands
and
reefs
lie
north
and
south
off
cape
noshafu
and
make
navigation
very
unsafe
for
the
small
coasting
crafts
which
sometimes
during
the
summer
call
at
nemuro
for
herring
salt
salmon
and
herring
guano
the
first
exported
chiefly
to
china
the
others
to
tokio
and
southern
japan
herrings
are
caught
in
large
numbers
during
the
spring
and
summer
and
the
export
of
would
be
considerably
increased
if
the
harbour
at
nemuro
could
be
safely
entered
by
larger
ships
as
it
is
now
though
well
sheltered
by
the
small
island
of
bentenjima
it
can
only
harbour
small
ships
as
besides
not
being
deep
its
entrance
is
narrow
and
of
difficult
access
during
the
thick
fogs
of
the
summer
in
the
winter
and
part
of
the
spring
the
harbour
and
the
coast
as
far
as
noshafu
cape
are
blocked
with
drift
ice
thus
stopping
navigation
altogether
the
trade
from
the
adjoining
coast
and
the
kurile
islands
concentrates
at
this
port
and
as
a
farming
region
the
small
portion
of
available
land
of
the
town
has
given
fairly
good
results
has
proved
a
success
for
the
local
wants
but
hardly
so
in
producing
a
fine
breed
of
horses
on
the
other
hand
has
been
a
failure
all
through
owing
to
the
severe
weather
in
winter
which
the
imported
animals
could
not
stand
in
spite
of
strong
easterly
winds
heavy
fogs
ice
and
snow
fair
crops
of
potatoes
turnips
barley
beans
wheat
and
hemp
are
successfully
raised
here
as
the
soil
is
of
extremely
good
quality
as
to
the
town
itself
it
is
prettily
laid
out
the
streets
crossing
each
other
at
right
angles
while
some
of
the
houses
are
built
in
style
to
meet
the
severity
of
the
climate
a
shinto
temple
is
erected
on
the
high
level
and
from
this
is
obtained
a
fine
view
of
the
harbour
and
town
with
the
numerous
storehouses
overlooking
the
sea
as
i
have
given
a
short
description
of
the
town
uninteresting
save
from
a
commercial
point
of
view
i
feel
that
i
owe
a
few
lines
to
its
inhabitants
belonging
nearly
all
to
a
young
and
adventurous
generation
they
reminded
me
of
the
same
type
of
englishmen
who
have
abandoned
their
fatherland
and
settled
in
america
and
australia
striving
and
often
succeeding
in
making
a
fortune
such
men
are
invariably
of
a
different
make
from
that
of
the
young
fellows
who
are
satisfied
to
drudge
for
life
in
a
bank
a
merchant
office
or
a
shop
vegetating
rather
than
living
following
their
day
routine
in
a
mechanical
sort
of
way
grumbling
continually
but
never
bold
enough
to
attempt
any
improvement
of
their
position
as
one
is
born
an
artist
a
musician
or
a
literary
man
one
has
to
be
born
a
colonist
to
be
a
successful
one
the
young
japanese
whom
i
met
at
nemuro
impressed
me
as
being
thoroughly
different
from
any
i
had
come
across
in
my
one
year
stay
in
southern
japan
and
i
was
agreeably
surprised
when
i
found
that
i
was
dealing
with
a
lot
of
young
clever
and
serious
men
willing
to
improve
their
country
and
themselves
and
anxious
to
accept
any
practical
hint
that
would
enable
them
to
accomplish
this
in
the
shortest
time
possible
in
other
words
they
had
lost
the
slow
phlegmatic
way
of
transacting
business
of
the
and
had
accepted
the
quick
perception
of
the
true
colonist
who
is
always
ready
to
catch
all
the
chances
which
will
help
him
to
get
on
in
life
i
had
been
struck
with
this
energy
this
faculty
several
times
along
the
and
coasts
when
conversing
with
the
japanese
with
whom
i
came
in
contact
but
i
was
never
so
much
impressed
as
at
nemuro
where
indeed
the
men
are
of
a
superior
class
and
belonging
to
good
families
while
most
of
the
japanese
at
fishing
stations
along
the
coast
are
taken
from
the
scum
of
the
towns
they
are
often
escaped
or
or
else
people
who
found
it
advisable
to
abandon
the
livelier
shores
of
nippon
leaving
no
trace
of
themselves
rather
than
end
their
days
in
a
prison
cell
nemuro
is
a
progressive
place
in
every
way
and
had
it
been
built
five
miles
further
west
it
would
have
been
intersected
by
the
onnetto
river
a
short
outlet
of
the
onnetto
lagoon
which
would
have
formed
a
larger
and
safer
harbour
than
the
present
nemuro
anchorage
as
it
is
prosperity
showed
itself
in
the
usual
way
by
the
number
of
for
all
classes
a
theatre
numerous
singers
and
dancers
and
a
whole
street
of
houses
of
light
morals
in
which
behind
a
wooden
grating
similar
to
a
huge
cage
dozens
of
girls
are
shown
in
their
gaudy
red
and
gold
embroidered
with
elaborate
round
their
waist
and
expensive
long
hairpins
artistically
surrounding
their
heads
like
a
halo
there
in
a
line
the
pretty
girls
sit
for
several
hours
on
their
heels
in
front
of
a
brazier
smoking
their
diminutive
pipes
they
are
fair
game
for
now
the
compliments
and
now
the
jokes
of
the
crowd
promenading
up
and
down
the
street
in
the
evening
every
now
and
then
when
an
admirer
approaches
the
cage
one
of
the
girls
gets
up
refills
her
tiny
pipe
with
tobacco
and
offers
it
to
him
not
forgetting
to
wipe
the
mouthpiece
with
the
palm
of
her
hand
before
so
doing
he
the
admirer
puffs
away
and
returns
the
empty
pipe
with
thanks
shifting
on
to
another
cage
to
have
his
next
smoke
japanese
men
can
not
live
without
and
it
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
that
nemuro
being
a
prosperous
place
there
are
many
of
them
a
is
a
singer
or
dancer
posturing
or
both
and
one
or
more
generally
attend
and
festivities
of
any
kind
some
sing
with
of
others
display
their
wonderful
powers
of
mimicking
and
posturising
in
which
grace
is
never
lacking
a
long
a
and
a
pretty
pair
of
white
short
socks
with
split
toes
make
up
the
graceful
and
simple
attire
in
which
they
appear
in
the
house
their
hair
plastered
down
with
camelia
oil
is
a
veritable
work
of
art
it
is
carefully
combed
oiled
and
flattened
behind
the
ears
a
metal
fastener
at
the
lowest
point
of
the
curve
keeps
it
in
this
flat
position
and
it
is
then
raised
again
and
fastened
at
the
back
of
the
head
first
in
a
most
elaborate
twist
and
then
rolled
up
in
graceful
curves
a
pretty
tasteful
a
long
hairpin
is
placed
on
the
left
side
of
the
head
thus
completing
that
part
of
a
toilette
the
sallow
complexion
characteristic
of
the
race
is
despised
by
the
womankind
of
japan
and
all
women
are
given
to
painting
themselves
with
us
such
a
custom
is
not
uncommon
but
it
is
disregarded
by
most
sensible
women
in
japan
it
is
part
of
the
ordinary
woman
daily
toilette
a
thick
layer
of
white
chalk
is
first
smeared
with
a
soft
brush
over
the
face
neck
shoulders
arms
and
hands
then
the
pretty
dipping
her
first
finger
in
red
paint
gently
rubs
this
on
her
cheeks
her
temples
and
over
the
upper
eyelids
the
middle
finger
is
the
black
brush
and
adds
sentiment
to
the
expression
by
blackening
under
the
eyes
and
sometimes
when
the
eyebrows
are
not
shaved
it
is
also
used
to
accentuate
them
a
piece
of
burnt
cork
is
often
used
as
a
substitute
for
black
paint
the
fourth
finger
has
no
occupation
but
the
little
finger
is
for
finishing
touches
brightening
up
the
mouth
with
carmine
and
adding
a
bit
of
gold
on
the
lower
lip
a
paints
herself
to
a
much
greater
extent
than
other
women
and
with
brighter
colours
as
to
her
moral
qualities
a
is
usually
not
immoral
enough
to
be
called
fast
yet
too
fast
to
be
qualified
as
moral
their
music
and
posturing
have
a
great
charm
for
japanese
and
when
money
is
made
a
good
quantity
of
it
goes
to
keeping
up
these
feminine
musicians
and
their
establishments
to
show
how
enterprising
and
americanised
the
nemuro
people
are
i
shall
ask
the
reader
forgiveness
for
again
relating
a
personal
experience
which
at
the
time
greatly
amused
me
i
was
in
the
midst
of
my
simple
japanese
dinner
in
the
jamaruru
when
four
youths
entered
my
room
and
offered
to
shake
hands
with
me
a
most
unusual
thing
with
japanese
one
of
them
handed
me
his
card
on
which
i
read
sato
nemuro
newspaper
oh
i
said
in
japanese
you
have
even
a
newspaper
at
nemuro
yes
answered
in
english
one
of
his
friends
a
yuasa
handing
me
his
own
card
you
speak
english
then
mr
yuasa
yes
can
i
offer
you
and
your
friends
anything
to
drink
or
to
eat
yes
what
will
you
have
yes
will
you
have
some
no
no
i
come
to
speak
to
you
thank
you
no
no
i
come
to
your
in
nemuro
newspaper
please
speak
where
come
how
old
where
go
when
i
had
sufficiently
recovered
from
the
shock
of
his
announcement
that
he
had
come
to
take
my
life
and
understood
what
he
meant
by
it
i
had
a
most
pleasant
conversation
in
english
with
him
and
in
japanese
with
the
others
yuasa
english
improved
as
his
shyness
wore
off
showing
that
he
had
a
very
fair
knowledge
of
the
language
the
interview
lasted
many
hours
continually
interrupted
by
the
and
the
really
and
indeed
of
my
visitors
while
notes
were
taken
by
the
editor
and
his
staff
they
finally
departed
and
early
the
next
morning
i
received
the
following
letter
sir
i
long
that
you
will
correspond
to
me
any
events
wherever
you
have
met
them
in
your
journey
when
you
are
not
so
awful
busy
as
i
have
to
translate
and
write
on
the
nemuro
i
meet
the
first
time
here
and
i
hope
to
have
your
friendly
favor
hitherto
and
thanks
for
your
kindness
i
have
received
ever
believe
me
your
humble
servant
f
yuasa
the
same
afternoon
the
editor
and
his
staff
called
again
accompanied
by
the
two
nakamuras
the
richest
merchants
in
nemuro
and
they
insisted
on
giving
me
a
european
dinner
after
my
experience
at
otsu
as
regards
european
cooking
by
japanese
i
was
rather
loth
to
accept
their
kind
invitation
but
i
had
to
yield
the
feast
began
with
biscuits
and
jam
and
the
soup

vegetables
were

by
roast
chicken

the
latter
by
salad
and
fried
fish
with
the
exception
of
the
somewhat
inverted
order
of
the
courses
this
time
it
was
actually
a
european
dinner
and
even
but
my
hosts
were
seen
at
a
great
disadvantage
when
using
a
knife
and
fork
as
for
the
anatomy
of
the
chicken
that
was
decidedly
their
weakest
point
those
of
the
party
who
were
shy
gave
up
the
carving
as
a
bad
job
the
bolder
only
fought
bravely
and
every
now
and
then
a
knife
gave
a
terrible
squeak
on
the
plate
and
half
a
leg
a
wing
or
a
carcase
was
fired
right
across
the
table
into
one
plate

not
in
one
face
or
on
one
lap
the
japanese
always
begin
their
meals
with
sweets
taihen
really
it
is
very
difficult
said
the
wit
of
the
party
helplessly
putting
down
his
knife
and
fork
after
trying
to
separate
the
two
parts
of
a
wing
this
bird
bones
have
lost
all
their
joints
in
the
cooking
my
hosts
were
extremely
kind
and
were
besides
so
clever
and
bright
that
i
enjoyed
their
good
company
immensely
at
the
same
time
i
gained
from
them
valuable
information
as
regards
the
neighbouring
country
and
the

the
kurile
islands
from
nemuro
i
put
to
sea
in
a
miserable
little
japanese
craft
a
kind
of
which
once
or
twice
a
year
goes
to
the
principal
islands
of
the
kurile
group
and
brings
back
their
products
to
nemuro
it
is
needless
to
say
that
i
was
the
only
passenger
on
board
though
it
is
fair
to
add
that
the
saloon
was
large
enough
to
accommodate
two
but
not
more
as
for
the
only
cabin
it
had
two
berths
one
over
the
other
but
no
available
space
for
dressing
or
undressing
which
therefore
had
to
be
got
through
outside
unless
it
was
to
be
done
by
instalments
lying
down
in
the
berth
itself
i
shall
spare
my
readers
a
minute
description
of
this
ocean
clipper
her
tonnage
and
and
i
shall
not
attempt
to
narrate
the
many
disadvantages
of
travelling
in
a
ship
engaged
in
the
and
trade
these
three
very
strongly
scented
articles
speak
for
themselves
without
the
need
of
words
the
kuriles
are
the
islands
which
stretch
like
a
row
of
beads
from
the
most
coast
of
yezo
to
the
most
southerly
point
of
kamschatka
they
extend
from
to
longitude
east
of
greenwich
and
between
and
latitude
north
the
archipelago
forms
part
of
the
japanese
empire
having
been
exchanged
by
russia
not
many
years
ago
for
the
southern
half
of
saghalien
island
then
belonging
to
japan
this
group
of
islands
is
characterised
mainly
by
the
great
extent
of
its
volcanic
rocks
and
tertiaries
showing
marked
evidence
that
it
is
only
a
continuation
of
the
volcanic
forming
the
backbone
of
yezo
and
extending
from
yubaridake
in
the
upper
ishikari
province
to
cape
shiretoko
which
volcanic
region
embraces
a
large
portion
of
the
tokachi
kitami
and
nemuro
provinces
in
this
chain
of
islands
there
are
many
beautiful
volcanic
cones
especially
in
kunashiri
and
etorofu
iron
copper
and
other
metal
veins
are
found
in
small
quantities
in
tuffs
and
andesites
but
more
important
here
moreover
are
the
large
sulphur
accumulations
near
and
in
craters
both
extinct
and
active
as
on
mount
rahush
in
kunashiri
and
the
ichibishinai
in
etorofu
the
largest
island
of
the
kuriles
at
pontoo
in
kunashiri
sulphur
bubbles
out
from
the
bottom
of
a
volcanic
lake
which
is
probably
an
extinct
crater
beside
being
rich
in
minerals
the
larger
islands
of
the
kuriles
abound
in
game
but
fishing
is
the
main
industry
practised
by
the
sparse
population
of
these
rugged
regions
the
origin
of
the
word
kuriles
is
not
certain
but
in
all
probability
it
is
from
the
russian
smoke
as
there
are
many
active
volcanoes
in
the
islands
the
more
poetical
japanese
call
them
or
the
thousand
islands
meaning
that
they
are
numberless
and
the
ainu
of
yezo
profess
entire
ignorance
as
to
their
existence
and
only
some
of
the
better
informed
give
them
the
name
of
by
which
they
really
mean
sakhalin
the
hairy
people
are
emphatically
poor
geographers
and
have
but
little
faculty
for
locating
islands
or
any
other
places
in
fact
how
could
they
having
no
maps
and
no
idea
even
of
what
a
map
is
the
chishima
group
and
the
island
of
yezo
with
all
the
smaller
islands
along
and
near
its
coast
when
taken
collectively
are
called
by
the
japanese
the
hokkaido
the
nearest
of
the
kuriles
to
yezo
is
kunashiri
and
south
of
it
lies
the
smaller
island
of
shikotan
then
comes
etorofu
the
largest
of
the
group
then
urup
after
this
a
number
of
unhabited
islets
reefs
and
rocks
form
a
barrier
separating
the
otkoshk
sea
from
the
pacific
ocean
shimushir
at
the
end
of
this
barrier
and
onekotan
at
the
are
the
two
largest
shimushir
being
about
thirty
miles
in
length
and
four
or
five
wide
and
onekotan
about
miles
long
and
eight
wide
paromushir
a
corruption
of
the
ainu
words
large
and
island
is
the
last
island
of
the
group
it
has
a
large
reef
on
its
coast
and
is
divided
by
a
channel
six
or
seven
miles
wide
from
cape
lopatka
the
most
southern
point
of
the
kamschatkan
peninsula
paromushir
is
about
twice
the
size
of
urup
and
is
very
mountainous
with
rugged
cliffs
of
volcanic
formation
and
high
picturesque
peaks
bearing
the
same
characteristics
as
the
scenery
in
etorofu
and
kunashiri
and
also
of
kamschatka
i
have
mentioned
this
last
island
as
it
is
of
some
interest
being
the
most
northern
point
of
the
japanese
empire
and
also
to
a
certain
extent
it
is
interesting
from
a
geological
point
of
view
but
as
far
as
i
know
it
is
not
inhabited
now
and
the
few
kurilsky
ainu
who
formerly
lived
there
migrated
further
south
from
one
island
to
another
till
shimushir
and
urup
afforded
them
a
more
hospitable
home
however
they
were
not
to
live
there
for
long
for
the
japanese
government
asserting
that
subjects
of
the
empire
who
chose
to
live
so
far
could
not
be
properly
looked
after
sent
the
small
ship
on
which
i
was
now
travelling
on
a
mission
with
orders
to
bring
them
all
down
to
the
formerly
deserted
island
of
shikotan
the
orders
had
to
be
obeyed
and
reluctantly
setting
fire
to
the
huts
which
they
were
about
to
abandon
and
never
to
see
again
ninety
souls
all
that
remained
of
that
nomad
tribe
of
ainu
were
embarked
and
carried
into
exile
at
shikotan
the
quiet
life
on
the
shikotan
rocks
little
suits
the
roaming
disposition
of
the
kurilsky
ainu
and
though
even
formerly
they
were
rapidly
dying
out
the
rate
of
mortality
has
increased
since
their
exile
having
thus
verified
the
fact
that
of
the
thousand
islands
of
the
chishima
group
only
three
are
inhabited
i
shall
avoid
giving
a
monotonous
description
of
each
islet
and
rock
and
i
shall
land
my
readers
at
shikotan
on
a
visit
to
the
kurilsky
ainu
who
are
important
to
us
in
connection
with
the
ainu
of
yezo
high
island
name
given
to
a
kind
of
salmon
it
was
early
in
the
morning
when
i
looked
out
of
the
porthole
and
by
a
fine
moonlight
saw
that
we
were
close
to
the
coast
huge
cliffs
and
peaks
ending
in
a
sharp
point
some
converging
towards
one
another
some
standing
upright
against
the
whitish
cold
sky
were
reflected
in
the
smooth
water
under
the
lee
of
the
island
the
moon
surrounded
by
a
yellowish
halo
shone
bright
over
the
rugged
scene
giving
delicate
bluish
tints
to
all
the
shadows
while
the
water
disturbed
and
cut
by
the
prow
of
our
craft
rose
in
gentle
waves
pursuing
one
another
as
if
running
for
a
place
of
refuge
in
the
mysterious
dark
shadows
of
the
cliffs
so
weird
so
enchanted
and
wild
was
the
scene
that
i
jumped
out
of
my
stuffy
bunk
and
went
on
deck
there
i
stood
notwithstanding
the
cold
gazing
at
the
gigantic
overhanging
black
rocks
at
the
precipices
crevices
and
natural
openings
through
which
now
and
then
the
radiant
moon
peeped
covering
the
dark
green
water
with
a
long
undulating
streak
of
silver
dashes
there
i
stood
listening
to
the
voices
of
the
waves
which
rippled
on
the
shingle
contemplating
this
strange
and
poetic
work
of
nature
i
am
certain
that
if
sirens
there
ever
were
in
this
world
their
home
must
have
been
among
the
whimsical
and
rocks
of
shikotan
island
the
old
tub
on
which
i
was
ploughing
the
waves
moved
slowly
through
this
heavenly
spectacle
of
beauty
when
the
sun
rose
enchantment
was
added
to
enchantment
the
cold
bluish
colour
of
the
rocks
became
gradually
warmer
and
as
the
light
grew
stronger
the
tops
of
the
cliffs
turned
into
a
mass
of
brilliant
colours
nature
was
waking
slowly
from
her
torpid
sleep
and
in
the
freshness
of
the
morning
a
light
breeze
caressing
the
shore
brought
with
it
the
smell
of
land
the
captain
a
japanese
informed
me
that
we
should
soon
enter
the
harbour
of
shikotan
and
pointing
to
some
huge
pillars
said
that
was
the
entrance
we
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
it
and
the
nearer
we
drew
the
more
i
became
convinced
that
the
captain
was
under
an
hallucination
i
could
only
see
rock
after
rock
huge
pillar
after
huge
pillar
but
no
entrance
whatever
we
are
just
going
in
said
the
captain
laughing
at
my
astonishment
and
he
gave
orders
to
the
quartermaster
at
the
wheel
to
steer
straight
for
one
of
the
pillars
we
were
but
a
few
yards
from
it
when
our
craft
was
made
to
swing
rapidly
on
her
starboard
side
and
we
turned
round
a
gigantic
shoulder
of
rock
to
find
ourselves
in
a
narrow
channel
one
minute
later
we
were
in
a
pretty
circular
harbour
surrounded
by
high
peaks
in
fact
a
kind
of
fiord
the
access
to
this
harbour
is
certainly
difficult
to
find
but
when
you
are
fairly
in
it
is
seen
to
afford
a
anchorage
it
has
more
the
appearance
of
a
small
mountain
lake
than
that
of
a
and
undoubtedly
it
is
a
submerged
crater
it
is
perfectly
circular
and
very
deep
but
not
of
large
capacity
directly
opposite
the
entrance
on
the
shore
is
a
small
narrow
valley
on
which
is
situated
the
village
of
the
kurilsky
ainu
four
men
rowed
me
ashore
and
i
went
to
the
village
when
the
japanese
imported
these
kurilsky
ainu
to
shikotan
they
allowed
them
to
build
their
huts
in
their
own
way
but
this
done
a
railing
with
a
gate
was
erected
closing
the
entrance
of
the
valley
which
overlooks
the
harbour
thus
preventing
the
poor
wretches
from
abandoning
the
island
to
resume
their
migratory
habits
and
return
to
their
more
northern
homes
inside
this
gate
two
rows
of
huts
exactly
similar
to
those
of
the
yezo
ainu
have
been
constructed
by
the
exiles
there
are
sixteen
huts
altogether
and
not
a
single
one
of
them
is
built
over
a
pit
in
chapter
ix
i
have
fully
explained
the
characteristics
and
mode
of
living
which
leaves
no
doubt
as
to
these
people
being
proper
ainu
and
not
as
some
have
asserted
though
of
course
their
type
is
slightly
modified
by
external
conditions
a
common
occurrence
in
all
races
take
a
londoner
a
provincial
and
a
seaman
and
though
they
be
all
three
englishmen
one
will
have
a
look
the
other
will
be
healthy
and
strong
but
not
so
sturdy
wiry
and
as
the
sailor
the
same
natural
process
is
at
work
with
this
tribe
of
ainu
they
conform
their
life
according
to
circumstances
and
places
and
though
they
possess
the
same
general
characteristics
as
the
rest
of
the
ainu
in
some
small
details
they
can
not
but
differ
from
them
shikotan
was
a
deserted
island
previous
to
these
poor
wretches
being
transplanted
there
by
the
japanese
government
it
does
not
abound
in
game
like
shimushir
urup
or
poromushir
whence
they
were
taken
illustration
shikotan
ainu
the
story
of
this
tribe
of
ainu
is
a
sad
one
hunting
sealing
and
fishing
were
their
only
aims
in
life
their
only
pastimes
the
only
things
they
lived
for
at
shikotan
they
have
none
of
these
things
there
is
no
big
game
the
only
animal
found
being
a
beautiful
species
of
white
fox
there
are
no
large
rivers
at
shikotan
there
is
hardly
any
vegetation
and
the
whole
island
is
nothing
but
a
mass
of
barren
rocks
the
food
of
the
kurilsky
ainu
consisted
chiefly
of
meat
of
bear
and
seals
berries
and
eggs
of
they
were
a
migratory
people
and
in
their
small
cranky
canoes
they
often
crossed
from
one
island
to
another
carrying
with
them
all
their
property
consisting
of
skin
garments
and
fishing
and
hunting
implements
these
latter
the
same
as
those
employed
by
other
ainu
the
dress
of
the
men
is
shaped
like
a
short
tunic
made
of
skins
with
the
feathers
inside
some
of
the
smart
ones
are
trimmed
with
seal
and
they
are
worn
fastened
round
the
waist
with
a
girdle
of
sealskin
or
a
belt
of
hide
often
ornamented
with
molten
lead
buttons
or
chinese
cash
the
women
garment
is
much
longer
and
reaches
nearly
to
the
feet
it
falls
loosely
and
has
long
sleeves
covering
the
hands
it
is
fastened
with
a
girdle
in
bad
weather
and
the
gown
is
then
pulled
up
to
the
knee
showing
the
long
yellow
boots
when
carrying
water
or
working
this
is
also
done
as
it
gives
greater
freedom
to
the
limbs
making
walking
and
all
movement
much
easier
a
red
yellow
or
handkerchief
of
russian
manufacture
is
tied
round
the
neck
and
another
round
the
back
of
the
head
and
this
makes
the
women
look
like
italian
peasants
as
the
gown
is
worn
usually
loose
it
has
the
identical
shape
of
a
it
is
ornamented
with
yellow
feathers
of
puffins
round
the
neck
and
the
edge
both
men
and
women
wear
either
moccasins
or
long
boots
made
of
sealskin
with
the
fur
inside
or
else
they
wear
boots
like
the
ainu
of
yezo
no
woman
that
i
saw
at
shikotan
had
a
moustache
tattooed
round
her
lips
or
any
tattoo
marks
on
her
arms
very
few
of
them
wore
earrings
though
all
had
the
ears
bored
for
that
purpose
and
had
worn
them
the
earrings
which
they
possessed
were
mostly
strings
of
coral
beads
and
metal
ornaments
of
russian
manufacture
which
like
the
handkerchiefs
they
had
received
in
bartering
with
the
crew
of
a
sealing
schooner
since
they
have
been
at
shikotan
the
men
have
been
presented
with
old
caps
and
overcoats
similar
to
those
of
the
japanese
police
previous
to
this
however
when
the
kuriles
were
under
the
rigid
russian
the
kurilsky
ainu
men
were
compelled
to
trim
their
hair
and
beard
which
was
the
first
step
taken
by
the
priests
of
the
coptic
church
in
christianising
these
nomadic
barbarians
when
this
order
was
complied
with
as
the
first
link
of
the
chain
the
coptic
creed
was
enforced
on
them
and
the
barbarous
kurilsky
ainu
became
orthodox
christians
at
shikotan
as
it
is
fishing
on
a
small
scale
is
their
main
occupation
praying

chief
of
the
village

high
priest
jacko
predecessor
in
fulfilling
the
duties
of
this
high
post
was
a
man
who
had
dropped
his
ainu
name
and
had
been
baptized
as
alexandrovitch
his
house
is
now
occupied
by

it
is

when
the

side
and
it
is
larger
than
any

it

built
of

instead
of

the

on
each
of
these
stands
is
a
russian
bible
with
images
hanging
on
the
several
rough
stools
and
a
couple
of
benches
are
placed
in
rows
in
front
of
these
stands
and
on
the
walls
hang
two
or
three
russian
religious
images
taken
altogether
and
compared
with
other
ainu
huts
jacko
chapel
had
quite
a
stately
appearance
just
as
the
ainu
of
yezo
have
partly
acquired
the
japanese
language
the
kurilsky
ainu
have
learned
to
talk
russian
besides
speaking
an
ainu
dialect
on
sundays
or
on
any
day
which
jacko
thinks
is
a
sunday
the
chief
reads
the
mass
before
a
congregation
of
the
other
hairy
christians
of
the
russian
orthodox
church
he
does
not
spare
them
a
sermon
which
sometimes
lasts
half
the
day
and
his
audience
are
most
attentive
and
well
behaved
none
of
them
would
think
of
leaving
church
before
service
is
over
but
one
detail
in
which
these
hairy
christians
are
not
yet
fully
christianised
is
that
no
collection
plate
is
ever
sent
round
the
kurilsky
ainu
have
undoubtedly
accepted
the
form
of
their
adopted
religion
but
i
rather
doubt
whether
they
have
fallen
in
with
the
principle
their
former
barbarian
ideas
and
superstitions
are
still
well
rooted
in
their
brain
and
each
individual
was
a
curious
and
enviable
combination
of
a
perfect
heathen
and
a
thorough
christian
according
to
what
suited
him
or
her
better
at
the
time
being
in
other
words
they
believed
in
two
diametrically
opposed
principles
one
of
which
fitted
in
with
every
phase
of
their
life
when
the
other
was
deficient
as
many
as
ninety
people
all
told
were
landed
at
shikotan
but
thirty
had
already
succumbed
when
i
visited
the
island
a
graveyard
on
a
hill
on
the
west
side
of
the
village
was
indeed
a
sad
reminder
of
this
fact
it
will
not
be
long
before
all
the
others
will
pass
away
for
consumption
and
rheumatism
have
a
great
hold
on
most
of
the
wretches
in
ten
years
from
now
i
dare
say
not
one
of
the
kurilsky
tribe
of
ainu
will
be
left
on
this
earth
it
is
pitiful
that
the
last
remains
of
these
independent
people
will
end
their
days
secluded
and
in
exile
on
the
barren
rocks
of
shikotan
as
it
is
they
seem
to
take
life
easily
and
with
a
characteristic
proper
to
all
nomadic
peoples
they
make
the
best
of
what
they
can
get
they
are
not
shy
and
they
have
dropped
the
formalities
and
grand
salutations
of
other
ainu
they
are
however
as
dirty
especially
in
their
homes
the
women
dress
their
hair
in
small
tresses
the
children
wear
long
gowns
similar
to
those
of
the
women
and
one
or
two
of
the
children
i
saw
had
very
fair
hair
as
will
be
seen
by
the
illustrations
some
of
the
men
and
women
possess
good
features
more
resembling
those
of
european
races
than
those
of
mongolian
type
they
are
gentle
and
quiet
like
all
other
ainu
they
are
submissive
and
resigned
to
their
sad
fate
the
island
of
skikotan
is
almost
circular
in
shape
and
it
has
one
or
two
small
anchorages
on
its
north
coast
i
judged
its
diameter
to
be
about
twelve
or
thirteen
miles
etorofu
and
kunashiri
though
much
larger
in
size
are
of
less
interest
to
us
in
connection
with
the
ainu
as
most
of
that
race
found
there
migrate
from
yezo
during
the
fishing
season
therefore
nothing
is
to
be
added
about
them
etorofu
is
a
long
narrow
but
irregular
island
over
one
hundred
miles
in
length
and
varying
in
breadth
from
five
or
six
to
twenty
miles
it
is
very
mountainous
and
has
some
bold
rugged
scenery
owing
to
its
volcanic
formation
etorofu
is
by
far
the
largest
island
of
the
kurile
group
and
it
possesses
many
safe
anchorages
especially
on
its
coast
where
several
mountainous
capes
branch
off
the
narrow
strip
of
land
and
afford
small
ships
a
fairly
safe
harbourage
from
west
and
winds
unfortunately
however
they
are
open
to
northerly
and
gales
during
the
prevalence
of
which
should
a
ship
happen
to
be
cruising
about
in
those
latitudes
she
would
have
to
run
for
a
shelter
to
the
coast
the
coast
is
not
peopled
with
the
exception
of
a
very
few
huts
near
moyorotake
or
bear
bay
at
its
most
point
a
better
shelter
however
is
to
be
found
in
the
bay
nearly
in
the
middle
of
the
island
on
the
shores
of
which
are
a
few
huts
at
onembets
and
imotsuto
most
of
the
coast
is
deserted
and
the
portion
is
very
rocky
huge
cliffs
with
high
mountains
in
the
background
ending
like
an
impassable
wall
into
the
sea
where
the
island
is
narrower
there
are
some
low
terraces
with
scrub
bamboo
and
stunted
trees
larch
is
found
in
etorofu
while
it
is
seldom
found
in
yezo
plants
are
also
indigenous
in
etorofu
and
cranberry
bushes
are
frequent
near
the
coast
from
betoya
or
bettobu
bay
down
to
its
most
point
etorofu
is
all
mountainous
with
the
exception
of
a
small
valley
near
rubets
it
is
along
the
banks
of
the
bettobu
river
in
that
small
valley
and
on
those
terraces
that
the
numerous
pits
of
the
are
found
and
also
at
rupets
further
south
on
the
same
coast
this
however
i
have
already
explained
in
connection
with
the
the
two
small
above
mentioned
are
respectively
under
the
lee
of
the
headlands
ending
in
cape
ikahasonets
and
notoro
cape
on
the
first
headland
the
mountain
of
tsiriju
rises
to
a
great
altitude
the
largest
is
at
shana
on
the
western
side
of
this
headland
and
further
north
besides
bettobu
is
the
small
station
of
shibets
of
shana
one
finds
rubets
furubets
oitoi
and
naibo
the
latter
in
the
bay
of
the
same
name
there
are
five
lakes
in
etorofu
two
of
which
are
between
shana
and
bettobu
one
near
rubets
the
other
close
to
naibo
the
fifth
is
a
very
small
one
fifteen
or
sixteen
miles
of
bettobu
the
country
has
a
rugged
look
and
in
some
places
as
near
rubets
where
the
volcanic
mountain
masses
leave
space
for
low
terraces
the
is
very
thick
as
in
yezo
and
small
and
stunted
trees
form
the
chief
vegetation
larch
is
more
common
on
the
coast
than
on
the
good
timber
is
rather
scarce
in
etorofu
but
a
fair
quantity
of
it
is
to
be
found
inland
and
also
at
the
portion
of
the
island
about
naipo
accumulations
of
sulphur
are
found
at
ichibishinai
and
there
is
an
active
volcano
of
bettobu
besides
the
beautiful
volcanic
cone
of
atzosa
three
or
four
thousand
feet
above
all
this
volcanic
mountain
mass
with
its
peaks
bears
the
characteristics
of
the
central
portion
of
yezo
and
there
seems
to
be
little
doubt
that
all
this
row
of
islands
with
the
frequent
submerged
craters
and
volcanic
cones
is
nothing
but
the
continuation
of
the
volcanic
zone
in
yezo
the
main
resource
of
etorofu
is
the
fishing
four
different
kinds
of
salmon
and
are
found
one
similar
to
the
salmon
common
in
yezo
the
others
somewhat
differently
marked
salmon
is
extremely
plentiful
and
in
july
and
august
enormous
catches
are
made
especially
at
the
mouths
of
the
rivers
where
the
fish
are
closely
packed
together
the
pico
strait
between
etorofu
and
kunashiri
is
about
fourteen
miles
wide
and
a
strong
current
from
the
okhotsk
sea
passes
through
it
causing
the
sea
to
break
in
heavy
and
overfalls
similar
to
those
observed
in
the
la
perouse
strait
between
yezo
and
sakhalin
similar
are
observed
also
in
the
channel
between
etorofu
and
urup
but
being
much
wider
about
miles
they
seem
there
less
formidable
kunashiri
is
the
next
largest
island
in
the
kuriles
after
etorofu
it
is
about
miles
long
and
very
narrow
varying
from
three
to
eight
miles
in
width
the
portion
is
somewhat
wider
and
extremely
mountainous
the
highest
peak
of
this
mountain
range
is
the
the
which
is
said
to
be
about
seven
thousand
five
hundred
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
from
this
volcano
starts
a
chain
of
hills
some
pyramidal
in
form
others
somewhat
rounder
at
the
top
which
forms
the
backbone
of
the
island
two
more
active
volcanoes
besides
the
are
on
the
portion
of
kunashiri
but
they
do
not
rise
to
a
very
great
altitude
on
horanaho
or
rausu
volcano
sulphur
accumulations
are
found
and
at
pontoo
small
lake
sulphur
bubbles
out
from
the
lake
bottom
and
seems
to
be
worked
with
profit
the
is
curiously
shaped
it
is
like
a
large
cone
cut
about
up
in
a
section
to
which
a
smaller
cone
has
been
attached
leaving
a
wide
ring
right
round
it
is
extremely
picturesque
and
a
worthy
finish
to
the
strange
outline
of
kunashiri
island
vegetation
and
products
are
the
same
as
in
etorofu
salmon
is
plentiful
and
a
few
are
spread
out
here
and
there
at
long
intervals
on
the
coast
as
in
etorofu
the
population
of
kunashiri
migrates
there
from
yezo
during
the
fishing
season
and
leaves
the
island
almost
deserted
in
winter
the
strait
separating
it
from
yezo
is
only
ten
or
twelve
miles
wide
bears
and
foxes
are
said
to
be
very
numerous
in
all
the
larger
islands
of
the
kuriles
and
seals
are
captured
in
large
quantities
during
the
winter
months
more
especially
in
the
islands
nearer
kamschatka
small
game
as
ducks
snipes
and
sandpipers
is
abundant
besides
the
ruggedness
and
strange
aspect
of
its
numerous
volcanic
peaks
the
bareness
and
the
loneliness
of
the
coast
there
is
nothing
in
the
kurile
group
to
entice
the
sightseer
and
the
to
a
cruise
among
the
islands
the
geologist
and
zoologist
however
would
find
in
the
kuriles
a
very
rough
but
very
interesting
field
for
their
investigations
and
a
good
shot
who
does
not
mind
a
and
lonely
life
would
find
some
good
sport
among
the
bears

on
the
east
and
coast
from
nemuro
to
i
did
not
remain
long
at
nemuro
after
my
return
from
the
kuriles
in
fact
i
remained
only
a
few
hours
and
again
my
baggage
was
lashed
to
the
again
i
was
perched
on
the
top
of
this
instrument
of
torture
and
soon
was
rapidly
moving
north
towards
the
inhospitable
coast
of
the
okhotsk
sea
the
first
few
days
of
the
lonely
life
of
a
peripatetic
robinson
crusoe
are
unmistakably
disagreeable
but
after
that
initiation
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
is
a
fascinating
life
i
was
more
than
glad
when
the
gay
nemuro
was
out
of
sight
and
the
noise
and
rumble
of
out
of
hearing
the
editor
and
seven
gentlemen
of
nemuro
accompanied
me
for
a
few
miles
then
i
was
left
to
myself
and
my
own
resources
crossing
the
onnetto
river
the
outlet
of
a
large
lagoon
of
the
same
name
i
passed
through
nishibets
and
then
bitskai
where
in
former
days
the
japanese
had
established
a
factory
which
proved
a
failure
owing
to
the
incapacity
of
its
directors
and
workmen
salmon
is
very
abundant
in
the
nishibets
river
and
a
canning
factory
would
be
a
great
success
about
ten
or
eleven
miles
north
of
bitskai
a
peculiar
peninsula
stretches
out
from
to
which
affords
a
shelter
for
small
junks
from
northerly
winds
it
is
called
noshike
and
is
not
more
than
a
few
feet
above
the
the
soil
all
along
is
very
marshy
and
the
numerous
little
rivulets
and
rivers
are
extremely
troublesome
to
cross
my
pony
was
continually
sinking
into
and
struggling
out
of
into
which
it
had
fallen
when
wading
across
these
small
watercourses
sometimes
not
more
than
a
few
feet
wide
i
pushed
on
as
far
as
shimbets
where
there
are
only
a
shed
and
a
couple
of
ainu
huts
inhabited
by
i
had
to
put
up
here
for
the
night
and
by
the
light
of
a
wick
burning
in
a
large
filled
with
i
wrote
a
few
notes
in
my
diary
the
fleas
in
that
house
were
something
appalling
the
next
morning
i
had
some
fun
with
a
wild
pony
which
i
received
in
exchange
for
the
tired
animal
i
had
brought
nobody
can
get
on
him
said
the
ainu
but
if
you
think
you
can
ride
him
he
will
go
like
the
wind
it
took
all
hands
in
the
small
village
to
get
the
and
baggage
on
to
his
back
and
after
we
had
tied
him
to
a
post
and
lashed
his
fore
legs
together
i
mounted
by
instalments
he
was
untied
let
loose
and
then
afforded
us
some
real
fun
he
revolved
bucked
kicked
stood
on
his
hind
legs
and
did
his
very
best
to
bite
my
legs
and
knock
me
off
the
saddle
a
small
fence
was
kicked
and
smashed
into
a
thousand
bits
and
he
even
attempted
to
enter
the
huts
anything
to
get
rid
of
his
rider
but
he
did
not
succeed
his
next
trick
was
to
plunge
into
the
river
close
by
and
when
he
reached
the
middle
to
shake
himself
violently
he
then
came
out
on
the
other
side
and
turning
his
head
saw
as
well
as
felt
that
i
was
still
on
his
back
then
he
neighed
as
if
in
great
distress
and
bolted
he
galloped
along
the
small
track
and
really
did
go
like
the
wind
as
a
punishment
i
made
him
keep
up
the
pace
even
when
he
was
tired
of
his
contumacy
and
in
less
than
no
time
i
reached
shibets
ten
miles
distant
from
where
i
had
started
shibets
is
a
village
of
one
hundred
japanese
houses
and
twenty
ainu
huts
the
ainu
here
have
almost
altogether
adopted
japanese
clothes
as
well
as
something
of
the
japanese
style
of
living
the
river
which
goes
by
the
same
name
is
notable
for
the
quantity
and
good
quality
of
salmon
caught
in
it
and
it
is
the
best
river
on
the
coast
of
yezo
herrings
are
also
abundant
but
not
to
the
same
extent
as
on
the
coast
a
peculiarity
of
the
river
is
that
before
entering
the
sea
it
turns
sharply
south
and
runs
along
a
bank
of
sand
and
mud
which
is
growing
larger
every
year
which
shows
that
a
current
from
the
okhotsk
sea
must
travel
down
in
that
direction
through
the
strait
between
kunashiri
and
yezo
the
same
peculiarity
is
noticeable
in
nearly
all
the
rivers
of
the
coast
from
shibets
to
wembets
the
track
is
fairly
even
but
from
wembets
round
cape
shiretoko
it
is
in
many
places
impassable
even
on
foot
the
peninsula
ending
in
cape
shiretoko
is
a
mass
of
high
volcanic
mountains
towards
the
interior
while
scabrous
cliffs
and
huge
rocks
fringe
the
line
of
coast
however
from
shibets
there
is
a
small
mountain
track
inland
which
brings
the
traveller
across
to
the
coast
near
shari
the
track
was
through
beautiful
forests
of
pine
trees
oak
birch
and
elm
and
during
the
first
few
miles
it
is
on
almost
level
ground
after
that
hill
after
hill
is
ascended
and
descended
and
one
goes
ever
onwards
at
a
higher
altitude
until
rubets
a
small
shed
is
reached
from
here
the
track
follows
a
direction
till
it
reaches
the
summit
of
the
mountain
range
and
one
then
begins
to
descend
on
the
other
side
from
the
summit
there
is
a
lovely
view
of
beautiful
blue
mountains
in
the
distant
west
one
of
which
is
called
oakan
and
the
other
moyokan
the
mountainous
part
of
the
track
from
igiani
three
miles
from
shibets
as
far
as
the
coast
reminded
me
much
of
the
scenery
in
switzerland
with
its
rapid
and
limpid
rivers
country
and
green
grass
which
last
was
replaced
here
by
an
undergrowth
of
scrub
bamboo
when
i
went
across
this
mountain
pass
the
rain
was
pouring
in
torrents
and
the
road
such
as
it
was
being
very
slippery
and
heavy
i
only
reached
the
coast
at
dark
the
moon
would
not
rise
till
late
there
were
heavy
black
clouds
and
i
was
more
than
puzzled
how
to
find
my
way
to
add
to
my
bad
luck
my
pony
this
time
was
a
sorry
beast
with
his
back
a
mass
of
sores
i
was
simply
drenched
with
the
rain
that
never
ceased
now
and
then
by
the
blinding
flash
of
lightning
i
could
see
a
long
stretch
of
sand
and
a
line
of
i
could
also
see
the
reeds
bending
low
under
the
squalls
and
then
everything
was
darkness
again
i
was
leading
my
tired
beast
and
dragging
him
along
as
well
as
i
could
every
few
yards
the
wretched
creature
collapsed
and
it
took
a
lot
of
petting
caressing
encouraging
and
beating
to
make
him
get
up
again
i
had
ridden
and
walked
about
fourteen
hours
in
the
rain
and
was
nearly
frozen
to
death
since
i
had
got
out
of
the
forest
a
bitterly
cold
north
wind
chilled
me
through
and
through
and
added
the
last
touch
to
my
weariness
and
discomfort
again
the
pony
fell
and
all
my
efforts
to
make
him
get
up
were
useless
the
storm
if
anything
seemed
to
increase
in
violence
while
my
own
strength
was
decreasing
every
minute
i
lay
down
by
the
side
of
the
pony
trying
to
warm
myself
by
his
heat
and
shivering
and
rattling
my
teeth
together
i
tried
to
go
to
sleep
a
couple
of
hours
were
spent
in
this
way
and
when
the
moon
rose
i
could
see
a
little
clearer
i
climbed
with
hands
and
feet
on
to
the
and
i
fancied
i
saw
some
dark
spots
in
the
distance
could
they
be
shari
first
one
end
of
my
whip
then
the
other
was
reduced
into
pulp
on
my
pony
back
and
with
a
great
effort
he
again
stood
on
all
four
legs
i
had
to
support
the
wretch
all
the
way
as
you
would
a
drunken
man
and
we
went
at
the
rate
of
less
than
a
mile
an
hour
the
spots
grew
bigger
and
bigger
and
took
the
shape
of
huts
hem
hem
hem
hem
i
called
out
at
the
first
hut
while
three
or
four
dogs
barked
furiously
and
went
for
my
legs
will
you
let
a
stranger
sleep
here
this
is
no
house
for
strangers
go
elsewhere
answered
a
drowsy
hoarse
voice
from
inside
may
you
be
kept
hot
said
i
in
pure
ainu
fashion
though
in
my
heart
i
attached
quite
a
different
meaning
to
the
sentence
from
that
which
the
hairy
people
give
it
and
wearily
i
pulled
myself
together
and
passed
on
a
shadow
crept
out
of
one
of
the
huts
and
thanks
to
that
shadow
i
found
a
shelter
for
the
night
there
are
fifty
ainu
huts
at
shari
and
ten
japanese
with
an
ainu
population
of
about
one
hundred
souls
the
ainu
here
have
adopted
japanese
clothes
and
many
of
them
eat
japanese
food
when
they
can
get
it
the
ainu
women
of
shari
are
exceedingly
pretty
as
they
do
not
tattoo
the
long
moustache
across
their
faces
like
other
ainu
some
of
them
have
a
small
semicircular
tattoo
on
the
upper
lip
which
is
not
very
displeasing
to
the
eye
and
in
some
cases
is
even
becoming
the
girls
have
also
given
up
tattooing
their
arms
the
men
are
much
taller
than
the
ainu
men
of
other
regions
and
they
seem
to
be
rather
japanese
blood
can
be
detected
in
many
of
them
and
that
may
account
for
it
while
the
women
are
prettier
the
men
have
repulsive
faces
possessing
all
the
characteristics
of
purely
criminal
types
one
young
fellow
who
sat
for
me
was
the
very
image
of
robespierre
in
his
worst
moments
and
an
old
man
who
sat
for
me
afterwards
would
according
to
phrenology
prove
to
be
a
murderer
of
the
first
water
this
gentleman
was
a
troublesome
sitter
and
excelled
in
making
the
most
awful
faces
which
were
accompanied
by
sounds
imitating
those
of
wild
beasts
the
shari
ainu
build
their
storehouses
with
cylindrical
roofs
similar
to
those
of
their
brethren
on
the
kutcharo
lake
after
the
heavy
storm
of
the
previous
night
the
weather
cleared
up
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
the
sunset
reflected
in
the
limpid
waters
of
the
river
was
simply
magnificent
on
the
other
side
sheltered
by
the
were
a
few
ainu
huts
standing
out
against
the
brilliant
red
and
yellow
sky
and
here
and
there
a
large
fish
jumped
out
of
the
water
leaving
circle
after
circle
of
concentric
rings
to
break
for
the
moment
the
reflection
in
the
water
from
shari
to
abashiri
the
road
is
for
some
distance
among
trees
mostly
fir
and
spruce
and
then
the
tobuts
lake
is
reached
half
of
which
is
a
mere
marsh
it
is
picturesquely
situated
and
i
followed
its
borders
for
about
three
miles
having
the
sea
on
one
side
the
lake
on
the
other
the
track
was
easy
and
mostly
on
sand
at
the
outlet
of
the
lake
into
the
sea
is
the
ainu
village
of
tobuts
access
to
which
is
to
be
had
only
by
boat
as
the
river
is
extremely
deep
and
its
current
very
swift
in
the
proximity
of
tobuts
another
and
smaller
lake
the
opoto
with
its
short
and
winding
estuary
is
on
the
left
of
the
traveller
while
a
long
way
ahead
the
abashiri
rocks
stand
high
on
the
horizon
a
few
ainu
huts
are
scattered
along
the
coast
and
some
of
them
have
peculiarly
shaped
storehouses
they
are
small
built
entirely
of
wood
and
roofed
with
shingles
some
have
two
floors
and
in
this
case
though
built
on
piles
the
first
floor
is
only
a
few
inches
above
the
ground
the
mat
was
supplanted
by
a
wooden
door
at
the
entrance
of
the
storehouse
the
abashiri
cliffs
are
grand
and
from
a
distance
have
all
the
appearance
of
though
they
are
not
in
reality
basaltic
rocks
they
are
scarred
riven
and
fractured
in
all
directions
as
if
by
excessive
heat
the
upper
portion
of
the
cliffs
is
of
a
beautiful
colour
blending
into
yellow
and
red
at
their
warm
brown
bases
the
small
cylindrical
islet
which
i
give
in
the
illustration
is
on
the
north
side
of
this
cliff
and
is
of
the
same
volcanic
formation
it
has
certain
traces
of
sulphur
as
a
further
evidence
of
its
origin
flocks
of
penguins
and
cormorants
have
chosen
this
island
for
their
abode
abashiri
is
the
only
place
on
the
coast
which
may
eventually
be
of
some
importance
as
it
has
a
fair
anchorage
for
small
craft
under
the
lee
of
the
islet
and
outstretching
cliff
no
other
place
on
the
coast
possesses
such
an
advantage
on
the
shiretoko
peninsula
sulphur
accumulations
are
found
at
itashibeoni
but
unfortunately
the
want
of
a
safe
harbour
the
ruggedness
of
the
coast
and
the
lack
of
drinkable
water
in
the
vicinity
are
all
facts
which
make
it
improbable
that
it
could
be
worked
with
profit
for
some
years
to
come
the
ainu
at
abashiri
are
repulsive
creatures
especially
the
men
and
have
more
the
appearance
of
wild
beasts
than
human
beings
their
faces
are
almost
square
the
mouth
large
with
narrow
lips
the
ends
of
which
converge
towards
the
ears
the
nose
is
short
and
stumpy
they
have
very
heavy
eyebrows
and
the
eyes
are
almost
lost
under
the
shadow
of
their
projecting
forehead
ponies
are
scarce
and
bad
along
this
coast
and
the
further
north
one
goes
the
more
difficult
the
travelling
becomes
the
huts
are
rarer
the
human
beings
more
uncouth
and
solitary
the
coast
is
a
region
of
swamps
lagoons
and
quicksand
rivers
not
far
inland
from
abashiri
there
is
a
large
lagoon
the
then
a
few
miles
further
north
another
as
large
the
the
abashiri
lake
finds
an
outlet
in
a
river
which
goes
by
the
same
name
of
and
falls
into
the
pretty
bay
of
abashiri
but
the
as
well
as
the
larger
lagoon
of
which
one
comes
upon
after
having
passed
the
two
villages
of
tukoro
and
tobuts
open
directly
into
the
sea
the
strong
current
and
the
tide
often
block
the
entrance
of
these
lagoons
and
the
rising
water
finds
an
outlet
in
a
different
spot
these
lagoons
are
separated
from
the
sea
by
a
long
and
narrow
strip
of
and
crossing
the
outlet
always
involves
great
danger
if
the
unwary
traveller
does
not
choose
the
right
moment
the
tide
creating
a
great
inequality
of
level
between
the
sea
and
the
lake
it
follows
that
at
the
opening
of
the
lagoon
the
water
either
throws
itself
from
the
sea
into
the
lagoon
or
according
to
the
ebb
or
flow
and
makes
a
kind
of
whirlpool
the
saruma
lake
being
much
larger
than
any
of
the
others
while
its
mouth
is
much
smaller
and
underlaid
with
quicksands
the
danger
is
even
greater
and
the
safest
way
is
always
to
get
across
in
a
boat
at
slack
water
the
saruma
lake
is
about
fifteen
miles
in
length
and
from
two
to
three
miles
wide
its
water
is
salt
and
large
are
found
in
it
it
is
also
a
favourite
resort
for
seal
and
mallard
in
winter
they
can
be
killed
in
great
numbers
but
in
the
warmer
months
they
are
shy
and
very
difficult
to
approach
the
shore
of
the
lake
is
thickly
wooded
and
has
as
a
background
a
long
range
of
high
mountains
with
smaller
mountains
in
front
of
it
at
tobuts
a
small
village
of
a
few
huts
situated
at
the
mouth
of
the
saruma
lagoon
i
halted
for
the
night
there
was
a
change
in
my
diet
that
day
and
i
was
entertained
or
rather
i
entertained
myself
to
an
oyster
supper
they
were
enormous
oysters
similar
to
those
found
at
akkeshi
but
not
very
palatable
however
i
was
in
luck
that
day
and
not
only
did
i
have
this
oyster
supper
but
i
actually
was
the
hero
of
a
tender
little
idyll
in
this
country
surprises
never
come
alone
and
while
i
was
sketching
in
the
twilight
to
pass
away
the
time
a
tall
slim
figure
of
a
girl
came
out
of
one
of
the
huts
she
had
slipped
her
arms
out
of
her
robe
leaving
the
latter
to
hang
from
the
girdle
and
her
breasts
arms
and
the
lower
half
of
her
legs
were
uncovered
she
was
pretty
and
quaint
with
her
tattooed
arms
and
a
semicircular
black
spot
on
her
upper
lip
she
walked
a
few
steps
forward
and
when
she
saw
me
she
stopped
she
looked
at
me
and
i
looked
at
her
hers
with
her
soft
eyes
was
one
of
those
looks
which
a
man
feels
right
through
his
body
notwithstanding
all
the
he
may
possess
there
she
stood
a
graceful
silhouette
with
a
bucket
made
of
in
one
hand
and
a
rope
in
the
other
her
supple
figure
almost
motionless
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
me
she
was
the
most
lovely
ainu
girl
i
had
ever
come
across
and
not
nearly
so
hairy
as
most
of
them
indeed
in
that
soft
twilight
and
her
wavy
long
hair
blown
by
the
fresh
breeze
she
was
a
perfect
dream
illustration
an
ainu
belle
wakka
water
cried
an
angry
old
voice
from
inside
the
hut
interrupting
the
beginning
of
our
romance
and
she
sadly
went
to
the
brook
filled
her
bucket
with
water
and
took
it
into
the
hut
it
was
only
a
few
seconds
before
she
reappeared
and
came
closer
and
i
finished
the
sketch
somewhat
hurriedly
let
me
see
the
tattoo
on
your
arm
i
asked
her
and
to
my
surprise
the
pretty
maid
took
my
hand
in
both
her
own
gave
me
one
of
those
looks
that
i
shall
never
forget
and
her
head
fell
on
my
shoulder
she
clutched
my
hand
tightly
and
pressed
it
to
her
chest
and
a
force
stronger
than
myself
brought
her
and
myself
to
the
neighbouring
forest
there
we
wandered
and
wandered
till
it
grew
very
dark
we
sat
down
we
chattered
we
made
love
to
each
other
then
we
returned
i
would
not
have
mentioned
this
small
episode
if
her
ways
of
flirting
had
not
been
so
extraordinary
and
funny
loving
and
biting
went
together
with
her
she
could
not
do
the
one
without
doing
the
other
as
we
sat
on
a
stone
in
the
she
began
by
gently
biting
my
fingers
without
hurting
me
as
affectionate
dogs
often
do
to
their
masters
she
then
bit
my
arm
then
my
shoulder
and
when
she
had
worked
herself
up
into
a
passion
she
put
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
bit
my
cheeks
it
was
undoubtedly
a
curious
way
of
making
love
and
when
i
had
been
bitten
all
over
and
was
pretty
tired
of
the
new
sensation
we
retired
to
our
respective
homes
in
the
evening
as
i
was
writing
my
diary
by
the
light
of
one
of
the
primitive
lamps
somebody
noiselessly
crept
by
my
side
i
turned
my
head
round
it
was
she
she
grew
more
and
more
sentimental
as
it
grew
later
and
she
bestowed
on
me
caresses
and
bites
in
profusion
kissing
apparently
was
an
unknown
art
to
her
the
old
woman
in
whose
house
i
was
slept
soundly
all
through
this
as
old
women
generally
do
on
such
occasions
by
the
mysterious
light
of
the
dying
wick
casting
heavy
shadows
which
marked
her
features
strongly
with
her
wild
hair
fading
away
into
the
black
background
with
her
passionate
eyes
and
her
round
arms
the
girl
was
more
like
a
strange
fairy
than
a
human
being
i
sketched
her
twice
in
pencil
and
the
wick
that
wretched
wick
grew
feeble
and
for
the
lack
of
oil
began
to
dwindle
away
i
persuaded
her
to
return
to
her
hut
and
with
a
few
bites
my
hairy
maid
and
i
parted
the
morning
came
and
i
was
up
early
in
the
vicinity
of
the
huts
i
found
three
pits
similar
to
those
we
have
already
seen
and
previous
to
arriving
at
tobuts
i
also
found
a
fort
belonging
to
the
race
from
tobuts
continuing
my
journey
north
on
the
stretch
of
sand
between
the
water
of
the
sea
and
that
of
the
saruma
lake
the
travelling
was
fairly
easy
but
monotonous
the
long
chain
of
mountains
on
the
other
side
of
the
lake
was
magnificent
in
the
morning
light
for
miles
this
went
on
then
i
had
to
cross
the
yubets
river
in
the
picturesque
spot
where
its
waters
divide
before
again
uniting
close
to
the
sea
north
of
this
river
there
are
three
more
lagoons
the
komuki
the
shibumotzunai
and
the
yassuchi
the
first
two
of
which
have
direct
estuaries
into
the
sea
generally
blocked
by
and
both
are
as
dangerous
as
the
saruma
lagoon
when
the
water
unexpectedly
overflows
owing
to
the
heavy
rains
on
the
mountains
the
level
of
the
lakes
had
risen
considerably
when
i
went
through
and
crossing
the
mouth
of
the
first
in
a
boat
i
was
nearly
swamped
the
ainu
who
was
ferrying
me
across
did
not
lose
his
presence
of
mind
and
after
a
long
struggle
and
violent
efforts
we
reached
the
opposite
shore
yubets
is
a
village
of
eighteen
ainu
and
three
japanese
huts
the
ainu
along
these
shores
are
extremely
hairy
and
some
of
them
have
red
beards
while
others
are
bald
near
some
of
their
huts
you
may
see
cages
where
foxes
and
eagles
are
kept
in
captivity
the
women
all
the
way
to
soya
cape
the
most
northern
point
of
yezo
have
given
up
tattooing
a
long
moustache
and
their
arms
a
small
semicircular
spot
similar
to
the
tattoo
of
the
shari
women
is
nevertheless
not
uncommon
bears
yellow
and
black
again
are
said
to
be
in
huge
quantities
on
the
mountains
at
the
back
of
the
saruma
and
other
lagoons
the
coast
is
most
one
may
travel
mile
after
mile
without
seeing
a
hut
or
meeting
a
single
human
being
now
and
then
when
i
came
to
a
lonely
fisherman
hut
i
was
civilly
treated
and
riding
from
morn
till
night
i
reached
shari
mombets
where
there
are

was
roughly
treated
here
at
first
for
some
russian
convicts
who
had
escaped
from
sakhalin
in
an
open
boat
had
been
drifted
by
the
current
down
this
coast
and
previously
to
my
arrival
had
landed
in
the
vicinity
of
this
village
they
were
half
starved
and
could
not
speak
a
word
of
the
language
they
had
no
money
and
no
clothes
and
none
of
the
natives
seemed
willing
to
help
them
in
any
way
now
that
the
freedom
was
obtained
after
years
of
servitude
and
chains
the
four
brave
men
who
had
suffered
agonies
for
days
and
had
almost
miraculously
escaped
death
in
the
treacherous
currents
of
the
otkoshk
sea
were
certainly
not
to
be
outwitted
by
a
handful
of
japanese
or
by
a
pack
of
hairy
ainu
they
begged
for
food
and
could
not
obtain
it
so
they
stole
it
and
some
of
the
natives
who
interfered
they
then
disappeared
towards
the
south
when
i
put
in
an
appearance
all
alone
and
almost
in
rags
leading
and
dragging
my
tired
pony
it
is
not
astonishing
that
the
first
thing
that
struck
them
was
that
i
must
be
another
escaped
russian
or
bad
man
from
krafto
as
the
ainu
called
me
ainu
word
for
sakhalin
the
reception
i
received
was
pretty
stormy
but
when
i
understood
what
the
matter
was
which
caused
the
rioting
i
set
their
minds
at
rest
and
speaking
in
their
own
language
told
them
that
the
bad
men
of
krafto
were
my
enemies
as
well
as
theirs
and
that
should
i
find
them
i
would
punish
them
not
only
that
but
to
make
them
perfectly
at
ease
i
gave
them
some
little
present
of
money
which
turned
them
at
once
into
friends
as
to
the
russian
convicts
there
was
no
possibility
of
my
finding
them
for
they
were
travelling
towards
the
south
from
this
point
and
i
was
moving
towards
the
north
so
i
was
perfectly
safe
in
passing
myself

did
not
show
himself
the
next

i
gave
much
more

expected

suffered
from
elephantiasis
the
wretched
disease
by
which
the
head
and
all
the
limbs
of
the
body
assume
gigantic
proportions
his
head
was
swollen
to
more
than
twice
its
normal
size
and
had
lost
its
shape
his
body
was
piteously
deformed
and
inflated
his
eyes
nearly
buried
in
flesh
the
weight
of
his
head
was
such
that
the
cervical
vertebræ
were
scarcely
strong
enough
to
support
it
erect
and
when
he
bowed
down
in
japanese
fashion
to
thank
me
and
bid
me
i
had
to
run
to
his
help
for
he
could
not
get
up
again

themselves

i
stopped
at
a
hut
my
host
was
decidedly
peculiar
for
convenience
we
shall
call
him
omangus
which
only
means
a
gone
man
or
a
lunatic
i
had
heard
of
him
further
south
and
i
was
anxious
to
make
his
acquaintance
i
had
not
been
five
minutes
in
his
hut
before
i
perceived
that
he
really
was
a
lunatic
his
head
was
of
an
abnormally
large
size
his
skull
was
well
developed
at
the
back
with
those
prominent
bumps
behind
the
ears
which
show
great
love
of
eating
his
forehead
was
high
and
very
slanting
the
upper
part
was
wider
than
near
the
eyebrows
which
were
so
thick
and
bushy
as
nearly
to
cover
the
eyes
his
nose
with
its
large
nostrils
was
stumpy
and
covered
with
hair
while
his
enormous
projecting
eyes
were
restless
and
fierce
his
luxuriant
moustache
and
beard
matched
the
thick
crop
of
long
black
hair
which
covered
his
whole
body
his
legs
were
short
wiry
with
stiff
and
swollen
joints
probably
owing
to
rheumatism
his
arms
were
very
long
and
his
toes
were
also
abnormally
long
altogether
he
had
the
appearance
of
a
large
more
than
that
of
a
human
being
all
his
movements
resembled
those
of
a
wild
beast
and
now
and
then
when
pleased
or
dissatisfied
he
would
groan
in
a
way
not
dissimilar
to
the
growling
of
a
bear
in
fact
he
was
labouring
under
the
belief
that
he
was
a
wild
beast
of
some
sort
and
apparently
he
regarded
himself
as
a
bruin
i
never
heard
him
speak
or
utter
words
but
whether
he
was
actually
dumb
or
not
i
was
not
able
to
ascertain
as
every
time
i
tried
to
examine
his
mouth
he
attempted
to
bite
me
his
biting
however
was
of
a
different
nature
from
that
of
the
sweet
girl
on
the
saruma
shores
and
when
he
did
bite
he
bit
well
one
day
in
a
struggle
i
came
off
nearly
minus
two
joints
of
the
third
finger
of
my
right
hand
i
several
times
attempted
to
take
measurements
of
his
skull
and
bones
but
with
no
success
once
as
i
had
got
hold
of
him
and
was
feeling
the
bumps
on
his
skull
he
managed
to
disentangle
himself
and
grabbed
me
by
the
hair
which
led
to
a
conflict
and
caused
me
a
très
mauvais
quart
we
fought
desperately
and
i
was
thoroughly
licked
not
however
before
having
found
out
that
he
had
no
bump
of
sensitiveness
and
none
of
philoprogenitiveness
he
was
pleased
with
his
victory
and
the
hostilities
ended
he
hopped
away
cautiously
and
i
saw
him
climb
on
his
hands
and
feet
over
the
cliff
near
his
hut
where
he
disappeared
some
hours
later
i
saw
the
monomaniac
stealthily
creeping
back
among
the
rocks
i
was
some
way
from
the
hut
in
a
place
where
he
could
not
see
me
he
came
slowly
forward
watching
the
hut
suspiciously
as
he
evidently
thought
i
was
still
inside
when
he
got
near
he
stopped
to
pick
up
a
large
stone
and
with
it
in
his
right
hand
he
sneaked
along
towards
the
hut
he
listened
and
crept
in
i
followed
immediately
after
he
was
furious
when
i
entered
and
tried
to
escape
but
i
barred
his
way
he
retreated
into
a
corner
crouched
down
groaning
and
showed
signs
of
impatience
i
could
see
that
he
was
frightened
and
i
went
to
him
and
endeavoured
to
soothe
him
not
without
success
for
he
became
quieter
and
i
once
more
noticed
the
great
power
that
a
stronger
will
can
exercise
over
a
weaker
one
as
long
as
i
was
staring
at
him
he
never
dared
to
move
and
i
could
will
him
to
do
almost
anything
i
wanted
by
thinking
hard
that
he
should
do
it
but
when
once
i
turned
my
eyes
away
i
had
no
more
control
over
him
this
is
just
what
happened
that
day
thinking
that
he
would
keep
quiet
for
some
minutes
i
got
out
my
palette
and
brushes
in
order
to
take
his
likeness
i
had
till
then
relied
on
my
power
of
willing
people
when
my
host
seizing
the
opportunity
of
my
turning
my
head
away
for
one
moment
grabbed
the
stone
which
he
had
picked
up
and
threw
it
with
great
force
at
me
i
was
hit
in
the
ribs
and
was
hurt
sufficiently
to
lose
my
temper
i
went
for
him
and
gave
him
a
sound
thrashing
which
sometimes
has
more
effect
than
all
the
willing
in
the
world
he
became
docile
after
that
and
i
took
him
outside
and
forced
him
to
squat
down
illustration
my
host
the
madman
he
was
restless
while
i
was
painting
him
and
hundreds
of
crows
which
seemed
to
be
on
good
terms
with
my
sitter
gathered
round
him
chatting
in
their
incomprehensible
and
noisy
language
some
of
them
even
flew
on
to
his
back
and
shoulders
and
he
touched
them
without
their
flying
away
i
was
astounded
at
the
familiarity
which
existed
between
the
madman
and
the
birds
they
seemed
to
understand
each
other
and
had
i
only
been
sufficiently
imaginative
i
might
have
asserted
that
i
even
saw
them
kissing
him
unfortunately
when
the
first
astonishment
was
over
i
understood
the
reason
of
the
affection
on
the
part
of
the
scavengers
and
the
whole
mystery
was
unveiled
to
me
like
all
mysteries
the
apparently
extraordinary
friendship
between
the
madman
and
the
black
birds
turned
out
to
be
a
plain
bit
of
literal
prose
and
i
must
add
a
very
disgusting
bit
the
maniac
was
covered
with
vermin
and
the
affectionate
kisses
of
the
crows
were
not
kisses
of
love
or
sympathy
but
only
mouthfuls
of
parasites
which
they
found
among
the
thick
hair
of
his
body
two
or
three
times
the
maniac
crawled
up
to
me
and
seemed
anxious
to
touch
the
colours
on
my
palette
and
also
to
put
his
fingers
on
the
sketch
he
saw
that
he
gained
nothing
by
being
a
foe
so
he
became
a
friend
he
even
became
a
great
friend
when
i
presented
him
with
a
shiny
silver
coin
though
omangus
was
undoubtedly
insane
he
was
a
very
practical
person
as
will
be
seen
by
the
illustration
his
attire
was
simple
and
no
allowance
was
made
for
pockets
he
looked
at
the
coin
turned
it
over
in
his
hands
several
times
and
grinned
then
he
placed
it
in
his
mouth
for
safe
keeping
his
mouth
was
apparently
his
purse
as
i
saw
that
he
was
fond
of
silver
coins
i
gave
him
one
or
two
more
and
all
of
them
were
religiously
kept
in
the
same
natural
pocket
except
at
night
when
he
hid
them
under
a
large
stone
at
sunrise
they
were
collected
again
and
placed
back
under
his
tongue
or
in
one
of
his
cheeks
i
can
not
say
that
my
host
was
by
any
means
brilliant
but
like
most
lunatics
he
was
a
good
soul
apart
from
his
little
peculiarities
it
was
unfortunate
that
he
had
lost
the
power
of
speech
or
i
might
have
learnt
some
strange
things
from
him
omangus
was
generally
restless
at
night
and
while
asleep
he
seemed
to
suffer
from
awful
nightmares
most
ainu
as
a
rule
do
not
one
morning
at
dawn
as
the
first
rays
of
light
penetrated
the
hut
i
watched
him
he
had
been
groaning
frightfully
all
night
and
i
had
not
been
able
to
sleep
he
was
lying
flat
on
his
back
breathing
heavily
and
now
and
then
he
had
a
kind
of
spasm
during
which
he
ground
his
teeth
together
with
violence
it
was
during
these
spasms
or
nervous
contractions
that
he
groaned
most
fiercely
as
he
was
so
stretched
i
noticed
how
extraordinarily
long
his
femur
was
compared
to
his
tibia
i
gently
placed
my
hand
over
his
heart
and
found
it
was
beating
rapidly
and
irregularly
his
forehead
also
was
feverish
and
abnormally
warm
he
did
not
wake
up
but
as
soon
as
the
nervous
strain
was
over
he
fell
into
a
lethargic
state
he
appeared
to
have
lost
all
strength
and
it
took
me
some
time
to
awake
him
but
he
finally
opened
his
eyes
and
drowsily
getting
up
yawned
to
his
heart
content
and
went
to
fetch
the
hidden
coins
the
more
i
saw
of
omangus
the
more
he
puzzled
me
his
faculties
were
defective
still
he
seemed
to
possess
a
fairly
good
memory
if
not
how
could
he
remember
the
concealed
treasure
although
he
was
not
able
to
form
ideas
of
his
own
he
could
retain
those
which
he
had
grasped
his
hearing
was
extremely
acute
and
his
inability
to
speak
must
have
undoubtedly
been
caused
by
paralysis
of
the
tongue
and
vocal
organs
several
times
he
made
violent
attempts
to
utter
words
which
he
would
not
have
done
had
he
been
born
dumb
after
the
second
day
of
my
pleasant
stay
in
omangus
ten
feet
square
residence
my
host
became
more
genial
and
even
affectionate
instead
of
constantly
running
away
from
me
he
sat
opposite
me
attentively
watching
all
my
movements
and
if
i
happened
to
be
whistling
he
slowly
crept
nearer
grinning
with
delight
occasionally
he
crouched
himself
by
my
side
even
resting
against
me
i
did
not
approve
of
the
latter
proof
of
affection
not
so
much
for
his
own
sake
as
on
account
of
the
large
company
which
he
carried
with
him
but
i
had
to
put
up
with
it
until
i
found
a
in
loud
singing
which
frightened
him
away
omangus
had
a
quantity
of
last
year
salmon
which
he
had
dried
in
the
sun
and
which
was
now
hanging
from
the
roof
of
the
little
hut
the
first
day
or
two
of
my
stay
there
i
had
but
little
to
eat
owing
to
his
belligerent
behaviour
he
rebelled
every
time
that
i
attempted
to
touch
his
provisions
and
what
i
had
to
eat
was
generally
appropriated
while
my
host
was
out
afterwards
however
he
became
generous
and
gave
me
more
than
i
wanted
he
took
good
care
to
draw
the
three
coins
out
of
his
mouth
while
he
was
eating
but
once
during
a
nervous
fit
to
which
he
was
often
subject
he
swallowed
one
of
them
one
morning
weary
of
my
lunatic
friend
company
i
packed
all
my
traps
and
went
to
fetch
my
pony
omangus
seemed
aghast
suspecting
that
i
was
about
to
leave
he
was
restless
and
followed
me
moaning
from
the
hut
to
the
pony
and
back
and
with
a
forlorn
look
in
his
eyes
watched
me
bring
the
baggage
outside
and
lash
it
to
the
i
gave
him
a
couple
more
silver
coins
which
i
thought
would
make
him
happy
but
he
dropped
them
in
the
sand
i
bade
to
him
and
left
and
there
poor
omangus
stood
motionless
gazing
at
me
until
the
winding
shore
took
me
round
the
cliff
he
was
out
of
sight
for
some
minutes
but
he
soon
reappeared
on
the
summit
of
the
cliff
itself
on
to
which
he
rapidly
climbed
and
from
this
point
of
vantage
he
could
see
the
coast
for
several
miles
there
standing
a
black
figure
against
the
rising
sun
the
hairy
ainu
became
smaller
and
smaller
as
i
moved
away
from
him
until
nothing
but
a
black
spot
could
be
seen
against
the
sky
then
even
that
spot
disappeared
it
was
the
last
i
saw
of
my
host
the
madman
the
rivers
were
troublesome
all
along
this
part
of
my
journey
and
as
most
of
them
had
quicksands
the
safest
plan
was
to
cross
them
in
a
boat
when
this
was
obtainable
however
as
i
went
further
north
the
boats
became
scarce
and
more
scarce
and
the
small
villages
few
and
very
far
between
i
seldom
came
across
a
human
being
with
whom
i
could
exchange
a
word
and
the
constant
solitude
induced
in
me
the
bad
habit
of
talking
to
myself
to
animals
or
to
inanimate
objects
my
unfortunate
pony
was
often
lectured
on
different
subjects
and
the
millions
of
seagulls
and
penguins
all
along
the
coast
were
asked
questions
of
all
sorts
which
however
they
invariably
left
unanswered
it
was
strange
to
see
the
myriads
of
birds
stretched
in
two
or
three
lines
along
the
shore
like
the
beasts
which
roamed
over
the
plains
in
alexander
selkirk
lament
they
had
seen
so
few
human
beings
as
to
be
indifferent
to
me
and
my
pony
and
i
could
walk
among
them
without
disturbing
them
or
causing
them
to
fly
away
the
penguins
were
my
greatest
source
of
amusement
with
their
fat
bodies
and
their
funny
way
of
lifting
up
one
leg
as
i
was
approaching
in
order
to
get
enough
spring
to
raise
themselves
from
the
ground
had
i
attempted
to
capture
them
i
was
soliloquising
according
to
my
then
custom
while
watching
these
droll
birds
when
not
more
than
two
hundred
yards
ahead
i
saw
two
large
eagles
one
of
them
was
perched
on
a
low
cliff
the
other
was
flying
about
now
and
then
returning
near
to
its
mate
i
dismounted
with
my
revolver
in
my
hand
i
had
a
pocketful
of
cartridges
i
crept
stealthily
from
rock
to
rock
keeping
well
out
of
their
sight
until
i
came
close
to
the
pinnacled
rock
on
which
they
stood
i
was
then
about
fifty
yards
from
them
and
it
was
useless
my
firing
at
such
a
distance
with
a
revolver
i
peeped
over
the
rocks
and
one
of
them
saw
me
and
flew
away
while
the
other
remained
where
it
was
stretching
its
neck
in
my
direction
its
piercing
eyes
were
fixed
full
on
me
as
i
was
approaching
it
understood
that
danger
was
imminent
and
it
seemed
ready
to
resist
the
attack
i
drew
nearer
and
nearer
and
when
about
four
yards
away
i
fired
two
shots
both
of
which
went
through
its
breast
and
the
eagle
with
its
widespread
wings
fell
from
its
lofty
pinnacle
and
came
down
heavily
on
its
back
in
its
last
convulsions
it
made
desperate
efforts
to
clutch
me
with
its
long
sharp
claws
but
a
couple
more
shots
finished
it
the
male
bird
which
meanwhile
had
been
describing
circles
high
up
in
the
sky
over
my
head
plunged
down
on
me
with
incredible
velocity
i
emptied
the
last
chamber
of
my
revolver
into
him
just
as
the
wind
of
his
large
wings
made
my
eyes
twinkle
and
to
evade
the
grip
of
his
outstretched
claws
i
had
to
cover
my
face
with
my
left
arm
the
report
stunned
him
and
flapping
his
wings
he
rose
again
to
resume
his
circling
over
my
head
leaving
a
few
of
his
feathers
floating
in
the
air
i
reloaded
quickly
and
each
time
he
attacked
me
he
was
received
with
a
volley
another
bullet
went
through
his
wing
and
his
flying
became
unsteady
he
flew
on
to
a
distant
cliff
and
there
he
remained
i
seized
this
opportunity
of
carrying
the
dead
bird
away
and
lash
it
on
to
my
saddle
but
while
i
was
so
engaged
the
male
eagle
flew
back
to
the
pinnacle
where
i
had
first
seen
the
two
together
and
stretching
his
enormous
wings
to
their
full
width
screamed
as
if
in
despair
on
the
pinnacle
was
their
nest
and
young
and
that
was
why
the
female
had
kept
watch
and
ward
over
her
eyrie
and
also
why
she
had
not
abandoned
it
even
when
i
approached
i
mounted
my
pony
and
away
i
rode
with
my
prey
the
male
bird
followed
me
for
miles
and
miles
and
now
and
then
i
had
to
fire
to
keep
him
at
a
respectful
distance
ultimately
he
left
me
and
my
delight
was
immense
when
instead
of
seeing
him
over
my
head
ready
to
plunge
on
me
at
any
moment
i
saw
him
disappear
behind
the
cliff
flying
rapidly
but
unsteadily
back
to
his
eyrie
as
i
now
made
sure
that
he
had
no
intention
of
pursuing
me
any
longer
i
dismounted
and
proceeded
to
skin
the
eagle
i
had
shot
it
was
decidedly
a
magnificent
specimen
it
measured
seven
feet
from
tip
to
tip
of
wings
and
its
claws
were
nearly
as
large
as
a
child
hand
the
semicircular
nails
measured
two
inches
and
were
extremely
pointed
which
fact
made
me
feel
very
thankful
that
i
had
just
escaped
the
grip
of
its
male
companion
the
beak
was
enormous
of
a
rich
yellow
colour
the
upper
mandible
overlapping
the
lower
the
feathers
were
black
all
over
with
the
exception
of
the
tail
which
was
white
i
believe
that
this
kind
of
eagle
is
generally
called
the
black
and
is
found
in
kamschatka
yezo
and
also
along
the
siberian
coast
of
the
japan
sea
and
gulf
of
tartary
i
found
a
sheltered
spot
and
with
my
large
ainu
knife
proceeded
to
dissect
the
bird
each
minute
seemed
as
long
as
hours
for
i
feared
the
male
bird
might
reappear
on
the
scene
as
i
was
thus
occupied
in
stripping
the
skin
from
the
carcass
of
his
beloved
helpmate
there
is
no
knowing
what
effect
anatomical
researches
might
have
on
a
yezo
eagle
my
heart
bounded
with
joy
when
the
operation
was
successfully
completed
and
i
went
to
wash
my
hands
in
the
sea
i
came
back
to
the
bird
or
rather
its
skin
and
i
was
indeed
proud
of
my
work
when
a
horrid
idea
struck
me
how
was
i
to
get
the
skin
dried
i
should
be
moving
day
after
day
and
it
would
not
be
possible
to
pack
it
in
that
condition
among
my
sketches
i
had
no
arsenical
soap
and
unless
i
dried
it
in
the
sun
it
would
certainly
rot
and
get
spoiled
i
resorted
to
a
trick
i
fastened
two
sticks
crossways
and
having
stuck
one
up
the
eagle
neck
i
fastened
the
two
opened
wings
to
the
two
side
branches
of
the
cross
the
skin
was
thus
kept
well
opened
and
with
two
additional
strings
one
at
each
wing
the
frame
was
fastened
on
to
my
back
the
feathered
side
against
my
coat
while
the
inside
was
exposed
to
the
sun
and
the
wind
in
wading
a
river
i
saw
my
own
image
reflected
in
the
water
and
i
must
confess
the
appearance
was
strange
a
few
hours
after
a
group
of
ainu
were
able
to
certify
to
this
i
was
riding
slowly
along
the
shore
when
i
saw
a
few
of
them
not
very
far
ahead
two
men
were
the
first
to
notice
me
and
they
seemed
as
i
approached
they
stood
still
for
a
minute
shading
their
eyes
with
their
hands
so
as
to
make
out
what
kind
of
winged
animal
it
was
they
saw
riding
on
horseback
when
they
discovered
that
the
black
wings
were
on
a
human
being
the
two
brave
ainu
fled
crying
out
wooi
the
hairy
people
cry
of
distress
as
i
got
nearer
the
village
dozens
of
wild
dogs
came
to
meet
me
and
barking
furiously
followed
my
pony
while
the
few
inhabitants
frightened
out
of
their
wits
at
such
an
unusual
sight
hid
themselves
inside
their
huts
two
or
three
hurriedly
launched
their
and
put
out
to
sea
when
i
passed
the
first
hut
some
large
salmon
were
thrown
at
me
from
inside
probably
with
the
idea
that
i
might
satisfy
my
appetite
on
them
and
spare
the
lives
of
the
trembling
donors
food
was
not
along
that
coast
so
i
dismounted
and
picked
up
the
provisions
so
munificently
provided
by
the
scared
natives
i
tied
them
on
each
side
of
my
not
sorry
to
be
thus
saved
from
the
danger
of
dying
of
starvation
at
least
for
the
next
two
or
three
days
as
i
was
so
occupied
a
little
child
about
four
years
old
evading
the
vigilance
of
his
parents
ran
out
of
one
of
the
huts
i
took
him
in
my
arms
whereat
he
cried
bitterly
and
when
the
people
inside
heard
it
there
were
screams
of
indignation
and
despair
maternal
love
is
occasionally
strong
even
among
ainu
women
and
while
i
tried
hard
to
quiet
the
shrieking
baby
his
mother
as
pale
as
the
dirt
on
her
face
allowed
her
to
be
came
out
trembling
and
offering
me
another
large
salmon
begged
me
to
accept
it
in
exchange
for
her
child
who
she
said
was
not
good
to
eat
it
is
needless
to
say
that
i
was
magnanimous
enough
to
accept
her
offer
and
thereupon
handed
the
child
over
to
his
mother
who
fled
with
him
back
into
the
hut
then
i
took
off
my
wings
and
went
in
after
her
explaining
to
the
frightened
natives
what
i
really
was
it
took
them
some
minutes
however
to
overcome
their
first
impression
and
then
the
men
were
pretty
hard
on
the
women
for
having
given
all
the
salmon
away
the
same
scene
was
more
or
less
vividly
repeated
when
i
came
across
any
other
natives
during
all
the
time
that
i
wore
the
on
my
back
i
have
related
this
small
anecdote
as
a
few
years
hence
when
some
worthy
missionary
or
imaginative
traveller
visits
that
barren
coast
of
yezo
it
is
not
improbable
that
he
may
hear
of
some
additional
ainu
legend
which
the
good
missionaries
will
say
proves
that
the
ainu
are
fully
aware
of
the
existence
of
heaven
and
hell
a
heathen
child
the
legend
will
very
likely
run
whose
parents
had
not
embraced
our
christian
faith
was
one
day
plainly
seen
by
his
mother
in
the
arms
of
a
devil
the
devil
was
seen
by
many
and
he
came
from
the
lower
regions
on
an
unknown
animal
with
huge
side
paunches
in
which
he
kept
the
heathen
children
he
had
eaten
the
mother
who
through
her
wickedness
saw
herself
deprived
of
her
child
gave
offerings
to
the
gods
some
through
the
eastern
window
for
the
and
some
through
the
door
for
the
other
gods
the
offerings
were
accepted
but
none
of
the
gods
came
to
her
help
and
the
child
was
nearly
lost
her
guiding
star
appeared
to
her
in
that
supreme
moment
and
inspired
her
to
reach
down
from
the
roof
the
largest
salmon
in
store
she
walked
out
of
the
hut
and
offered
it
to
another
god
whom
she
knew
not
before
instantly
the
child
was
restored
to
his
mother
that
the
god
took
the
salmon
would
probably
be
omitted
in
the
legend
the
demon
vanished
and
the
hut
was
visited
by
a
white
being
freely
translated
the
guardian
angel
with
a
halo
my
white
terai
hat
round
his
head
he
rewarded
them
and
from
that
day
the
family
has
been
happy
in
the
faith
which
they
learned
in
such
a
miraculous
manner
does
not
this
legend
speak
for
itself
the
good
missionaries
will
tell
us
does
it
not
show
that
the
savage
ainu
are
christians
without
knowing
it
i
have
given
these
two
versions
of
the
same
story
as
they
show
the
reader
how
easy
it
is
to
garble
accounts
and
misrepresent
facts
it
is
a
good
illustration
of
what
i
say
in
my
chapter
on
the
ainu
beliefs
and
superstitions
and
i
must
be
forgiven
if
i
have
ventured
to
make
fun
of
the
missionaries
it
is
not
because
i
dislike
them
for
i
gladly
admit
that
some
of
them
out
in
the
east
have
done
good
work
but
unfortunately
most
of
them
will
not
take
an
view
of
facts
they
are
so
wrapped
up
in
their
good
work
of
converting
people
to
christianity
that
outside
of
that
they
occasionally
have
a
tendency
to
tinge
with
their
own
preconceived
ideas
facts
which
to
a
less
biased
mind
appear
simple
enough

chapter

on
the
coast
from
poronai
to
cape
soya
it
was
late
in
the
evening
when
i
arrived
at
poronai
saruru
the
last
village
i
had
passed
had
only
six
ainu
and
three
japanese
huts
and
the
nine
or
ten
miles
between
there
and
this
place
were
most
uninteresting
i
was
taken
across
one
of
the
quicksand
rivers
in
the
ferry
by
a
lovely
ainu
girl
of
about
twelve
years
of
age
i
have
never
seen
a
more
picturesque
being
than
she
was
she
was
partly
dressed
in
skins
but
half
her
chest
was
bare
her
black
hair
fell
over
her
shoulders
and
while
gracefully
paddling
across
the
ferry
she
occasionally
threw
back
her
head
thus
shaking
back
the
hair
that
the
wind
had
blown
over
her
eyes
large
stream
i
have
often
noticed
how
supple
the
children
of
savages
are
and
how
like
in
ease
and
grace
and
unconscious
rhythm
their
movements
are
to
those
of
wild
animals
sometimes
to
be
sure
they
have
the
jerky
quick
and
ungraceful
movements
of
monkeys
but
as
a
rule
their
actions
are
unconsciously
graceful
of
course
with
our
children
such
unconscious
grace
is
rare
at
any
time
even
when
found
at
all
as
from
the
day
when
they
are
born
we
train
them
to
artificiality
of
all
kinds
and
this
artificiality
becomes
in
a
sense
second
nature
overlaying
if
not
destroying
the
original
impress
and
yet
that
impress
is
probably
not
wholly
destroyed
for
so
far
as
my
own
experience
goes
i
who
had
from
my
birth
led
a
civilised
life
now
that
i
had
been
for
some
months
among
barbarians
had
so
little
conventionality
left
in
me
as
to
be
quite
happy
or
even
happier
than
before
in
leading
a
perfectly
uncivilised
existence
in
the
absence
of
chairs
and
sofas
instinct
and
the
example
of
the
natives
taught
me
to
squat
as
they
did
and
when
i
had
once
got
into
the
way
of
it
i
found
the
position
much
more
restful
than
any
of
our
european
comfortable
ways
of
sitting
it
was
the
same
thing
when
i
had
to
sleep
either
in
the
open
air
or
in
ainu
huts
where
there
was
no
more
bedding
than
sofas
or
easy
chairs
to
protect
myself
from
the
cold
i
almost
invariably
slept
sitting
on
the
ground
with
my
head
resting
on
my
knees
just
like
the
apes
in
the
zoological
gardens
i
am
sure
that
a
good
many
of
my
readers
who
have
never
gone
through
such
an
experience
will
put
me
down
as
a
crank
others
will
say
that
i
am
a
worthy
companion
of
my
friend
the
hairy
lunatic
and
the
most
charitable
will
think
that
bearing
the
name
of
savage
landor
i
am
only
indulging
in
a
new
edition
of
imaginary
conversations
without
the
literary
merits
of
the
old
such
is
not
the
case
i
have
mentioned
these
facts
not
to
amuse
the
reader
or
merely
for
the
sake
of
paradox
but
to
show
how
shallow
is
the
veneer
of
civilisation
which
we
are
apt
to
think
so
thorough
and
how
a
very
short
time
spent
unaccompanied
by
men
of
one
own
stamp
and
alone
with
nature
rubs
the
whole
thing
away
and
brings
us
back
to
instinct
rather
than
education
i
am
willing
to
admit
that
not
many
people
would
care
to
follow
in
my
footsteps
and
live
as
i
lived
for
months
among
the
ainu
in
order
to
prove
whether
i
am
right
or
wrong
many
who
have
only
sat
in
comfortable
chairs
or
slept
in
soft
beds
will
hardly
think
my
statements
credible
but
as
the
experiences
besides
being
of
great
amusement
were
of
great
interest
to
me
i
shall
pass
them
on
to
my
readers
no
matter
what
opinion
they
may
form
of
him
who
has
written
them

merely
instinctive
which
i
developed
in
my
lonesome
peregrinations
was
the
power
of
accurate
tracking
most
people
are
astonished
at
the
wonderful
tales
told
of
the
tracking
abilities
of
the
australian
black
fellows
and
of
savages
in
general
but
few
ever
think
that
if
when
young
they
had
led
the
same
life
as
these
savages
they
would
be
as
good
trackers
as
the
best
as
there
were
absolutely
no
roads
and
i
travelled
with
no
guide
servant
or
companion
the
power
of
discovering
traces
became
invaluable
to
me
it
was
instinctive
in
me
developed
rather
than
acquired
and
therefore
i
mention
it
in
connection
with
the
other
facts
relating
to
animal
and
human
instincts
furthermore
i
may
assert
that
until
i
was
thus
compelled
to
make
use
of
that
faculty
i
was
not
aware
that
i
possessed
it
we
find
that
horses
bears
and
most
animals
are
good
trackers
dogs
the
nearest
in
intelligence
to
men
are
better
than
any
other
quadruped
then
come
savages
who
are
the
masters
of
tracking
among
human
beings
but
as
we
rise
in
the
scale
of
civilisation
we
find
that
this
faculty
of
following
a
slightly
indicated
track
hardly
exists
does
then
intellectual
education
destroy
our
instincts
instead
of
improving
them
tracking
on
sandy
or
tufaceous
ground
is
an
easy
matter
as
of
course
the
foot
leaves
a
print
but
where
i
found
real
difficulty
was
over
rocky
ground
until
i
got
used
to
it
and
knew
all
the
signs
and
what
i
had
to
look
for
however
with
a
little
practice
even
over
rocks
which
the
sea
has
washed
it
is
not
impossible
to
know
if
such
and
such
creatures
human
or
animal
have
passed
that
way
one
of
the
first
things
in
tracking
is
to
look
for
marks
where
they
are
likely
to
be
and
this
is
just
where
the
instinct
comes
in
next
to
this
a
clear
knowledge
of
the
person
or
animal
way
of
walking
and
general
habits
is
necessary
for
instance
when
i
tried
to
discern
tracks
of
ainu
i
invariably
looked
for
them
along
the
and
failing
that
on
the
adjoining
cliffs
as
i
well
knew
that
if
any
ainu
had
passed
by
there
he
would
have
kept
either
along
the
coast
or
not
far
from
it
by
examination
it
is
easy
to
see
if
the
ground
has
been
in
any
way
disturbed
of
late
sometimes
a
small
stone
moved
from
the
place
where
it
had
been
for
years
shows
a
difference
in
colour
where
it
has
been
affected
by
the
weather
and
where
not
thus
giving
a
distinct
clue
of
some
man
or
brute
and
when
once
you
have
found
what
the
characteristics
of
the
tracks
are
the
most
difficult
part
of
the
task
is
accomplished
on
rocks
the
trail
is
more
difficult
to
strike
and
more
difficult
still
on
rocks
over
which
the
sea
washes
for
say
the
simple
people
how
can
you
see
tracks
on
hard
stone
the
foot
certainly
does
not
leave
a
print
on
rocks
as
on
sand
and
even
supposing
that
the
feet
were
dirty
the
sea
would
wash
away
the
marks
and
you
could
not
see
anything
in
my
case
i
limited
my
search
to
marks
as
the
ainu
generally
go
everybody
knows
that
dogs
track
by
scent
and
this
is
a
sure
proof
that
every
footmark
must
have
a
certain
special
odour
however
infinitesimal
when
we
remember
that
the
act
of
walking
makes
the
feet
warm
and
perspire
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
this
perspiration
which
is
a
greasy
substance
leaves
a
mark
on
the
stone
though
to
be
sure
it
is
sometimes
almost
imperceptible
especially
when
quite
fresh
but
most
of
us
when
children
at
school
have
noticed
that
touching
a
slate
with
moist
fingers
leaves
a
greasy
mark
which
could
not
be
rubbed
off
again
the
same
thing
happens
when
we
tread
on
stones
with
bare
feet
if
the
sea
washes
over
the
stones
after
the
greasy
impression
has
been
thus
made
on
them
it
does
nothing
but
accentuate
these
marks
and
show
them
more
plainly
as
the
salt
water
acts
in
one
way
on
the
untouched
parts
of
the
stone
but
in
a
different
way
where
the
grease
has
been
absorbed
these
marks
are
generally
very
faint
and
it
requires
some
training
before
they
can
be
discerned
but
when
the
knack
is
once
acquired
they
become
evident
enough
to
an
observant
eye
and
with
a
little
practice
it
is
not
difficult
to
perceive
whether
one
or
more
persons
have
tramped
on
a
given
place
and
in
what
direction
they
have
travelled
the
marks
on
stones
which
are
washed
over
by
the
sea
are
usually
of
a
lightish
colour
i
could
almost
invariably
distinguish
the
footmarks
of
an
ainu
from
those
of
a
japanese
as
the
ainu
take
longer
strides
and
their
toes
are
longer
than
those
of
the
japanese
moreover
with
the
latter
when
walking
the
greater
pressure
is
forward
under
the
foot
and
their
toes
are
turned
in
while
in
ainu
footprints
the
whole
foot
rests
on
the
ground
and
they
keep
it
perfectly
straight
moving
the
two
feet
parallel
to
each
other
i
have
given
these
few
points
on
tracking
as
it
will
explain
to
the
reader
how
i
was
able
to
find
my
way
from
one
village
to
another
miles
apart
to
steer
for
huts
where
i
had
never
been
and
to
overcome
great
difficulties
which
i
could
not
have
surmounted
if
i
had
not
learnt
the
art
of
tracking
and
so
far
developed
my
natural
powers
my
ponies
were
also
to
a
great
extent
my
teachers
and
by
a
close
examination
of
their
instinct
i
learned
that
i
myself
possessed
it
and
improved
on
it
between
sawaki
or
fujima
and
poronai
there
is
a
beautiful
forest
of
oak
and
trees
on
the
hills
and
firs
on
the
higher
mountains
while
the
shore
above
the
is
covered
with
thick
which
reaches
a
height
of
about
ten
feet
on
the
sandy
beach
besides
a
large
number
of
whales
bones
there
is
any
amount
of
driftwood
at
poronai
which
consisted
of
only
eight
huts
the
ainu
had
adopted
an
architecture
for
their
storehouses
different
to
that
of
other
tribes
the
walls
and
the
roof
were
made
partly
of
wood
partly
of
the
bark
of
trees
heavy
stones
were
placed
on
the
roof
to
prevent
it
from
being
blown
away
during
the
strong
gales
so
frequent
along
that
coast
the
natives
described
the
winter
weather
as
very
severe
especially
during
northerly
winds
and
they
told
me
that
some
years
the
sea
all
along
the
coast
is
frozen
for
some
eight
or
ten
miles
out
besides
the
which
sets
in
from
the
north
and
works
its
way
along
the
coast
as
far
as
cape
nossyap
in
the
neighbourhood
of
nemuro
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
this
ice
probably
drifted
across
from
sakhalin
by
the
strong
current
in
the
la
perouse
strait
sets
in
from
the
north
and
works
down
all
along
the
coast
of
yezo
filling
up
all
indentations
in
the
and
forming
a
solid
mass
on
the
surface
of
the
water
seals
are
very
plentiful
on
these
shores
as
far
as
abashiri
but
the
greatest
number
are
found
on
the
saruma
lagoon
in
winter
it
is
not
difficult
to
come
within
reach
of
them
but
even
in
september
i
saw
many
of
them
they
were
however
very
shy
and
when
they
caught
sight
of
me
instantly
disappeared
under
water
a
few
miles
from
poronai
i
came
to
a
headland
and
about
one
mile
from
it
lay
the
small
island
of
chuskin
the
coast
again
instead
of
being
sandy
showed
traces
of
its
volcanic
formation
forming
beautiful
cliffs
and
a
rugged
outline
rising
in
terraces
at
places
or
cliffs
of
clay
and
gravel
sediments
with
reefs
extending
far
out
to
sea
while
below
them
stretched
a
beach
of
coarse
sand
or
pebbles
strewn
with
enormous
volcanic
boulders
these
terraces
are
wooded
mostly
with
alder
yezo
fir
and
beech
soon
after
crossing
the
porobets
river
i
came
across
the
wreck
of
a
sailing
ship
which
lay
flat
on
the
shore
disabled
and
dismasted
and
at
last
i
reached
esashi
there
i
again
noticed
a
curious
fact
which
may
be
of
some
interest
to
anthropologists
namely
that
yezo
is
mostly
formed
of
tertiaries
and
volcanic
rocks
and
that
the
ainu
are
mostly
to
be
found
in
regions
of
cainozoic
or
tertiary
formation
in
volcanic
districts
they
are
very
scarce
this
is
curious
for
it
is
a
fact
that
the
typical
of
tertiaries
is
anthropoid
apes
and
it
is
a
remarkable
coincidence
that
we
should
find
men
populating
the
same
strata
from
esashi
the
coast
is
extremely
rough
and
rocky
for
about
eight
miles
i
had
to
take
my
famished
pony
up
and
down
steep
mountains
rising
directly
from
the
sea
in
places
where
the
beach
was
impassable
owing
to
the
lack
of
grass
my
wretched
beast
had
but
little
to
eat
and
what
with
the
danger
of
riding
and
the
miserable
condition
my
pony
was
in
i
had
to
walk
most
of
the
way
and
lead
him
shanoi
about
thirteen
miles
further
came
in
sight
a
group
of
wretched
fishermen
huts
and
from
here
the
coast
was
somewhat
better
the
scenery
all
along
is
beautiful
especially
looking
back
towards
the
shanoi
mountains
i
saw
one
or
two
abandoned
huts
blown
down
by
the
wind
but
no
people
near
shanoi
the
eruptive
rocks
and
granitic
cliffs
suddenly
come
to
an
end
as
well
as
the
mountainous
character
of
the
country
and
for
fifteen
miles
till
one
comes
to
sarubuts
the
country
is
pretty
flat
and
swampy
with
a
thick
vegetation
inland
of
spruce
trees
there
is
a
small
lagoon
formed
by
the
tombets
river
and
which
often
has
its
mouth
blocked
by
the
quicksands
which
cause
it
to
overflow
i
left
sarubuts
in
pouring
rain
following
the
trail
along
the
beach
the
river
forms
a
long
narrow
lake
similar
to
that
of
tombets
and
at
the
back
of
it
are
terraces
and
high
lands
but
no
very
high
mountains
another
wreck
of
a
large
boat
lay
in
fragments
on
the
sand
and
after
fifteen
miles
of
very
uninteresting
scenery
i
arrived
at
chietomamai
a
group
of
four
or
five
fishermen
huts
here
again
the
coast
was
rough
but
my
pony
did
not
sink
in
the
sand
as
it
did
on
leaving
sarubuts
but
it
stumbled
among
large
pebbles
and
stones
as
pointed
as
needles
further
on
were
grey
and
brown
steep
cliffs
which
were
extremely
picturesque
the
mezozoic
nature
of
this
coast
shows
more
distinctly
between
chietomamai
and
soya
cape
and
a
large
rock
emerging
from
the
sea
is
both
peculiar
and
picturesque
with
its
numerous
square
sections
it
is
from
this
point
that
one
gets
the
first
view
of
soya
cape
going
round
a
bay
one
passes
a
few
fishermen
houses
and
on
the
cliffs
above
them
has
been
erected
the
siliusi
lighthouse
i
cleared
the
cape
and
rounded
the
bay
on
the
other
side
where
i
saw
another
wreck
of
a
sailing
ship
dashed
upon
the
rocks
making
the
scene
a
sad
one
i
still
went
on
and
went
round
two
or
three
smaller
headlands
when
the
melancholy
sight
of
a
fourth
wreck
stood
before
me
this
last
ship
had
her
stern
out
of
the
water
and
a
turkish
name
was
painted
on
it
her
appearance
also
was
turkish
and
i
was
more
than
once
puzzled
as
to
what
a
turkish
ship
could
have
been
doing
in
the
la
perouse
strait
many
months
afterwards
on
my
return
to
yokohama
but
too
late
to
be
of
any
help
to
them
the
sad
story
of
the
survivors
of
that
ship
was
revealed
to
me
the
mission
of
the
ship
in
those
seas
was
a
mysterious
one
no
one
ever
knew
exactly
whence
she
came
or
whither
she
was
bound
no
one
ever
learned
whether
she
had
been
disabled
in
a
typhoon
in
the
chinese
sea
and
had
been
drifted
so
far
north
by
the
strong
currents
or
whether
the
careless
turkish
master
had
mistaken
his
course
and
had
met
his
fate
in
the
dangerous
currents
of
la
perouse
strait
only
four
of
the
crew
survived
there
they
were
on
that
deserted
coast
with
no
clothes
no
food
no
money
but
the
few
natives
treated
them
kindly
two
of
them
wore
red
caps
the
only
things
they
had
saved
from
the
wreck
the
natives
on
the
coast
told
me
of
these
men
who
were
tramping
their
way
south
unable
to
make
themselves
understood
continually
asking
for
or
which
i
believe
in
the
turkish
language
means
tobacco
or
cigarettes
after
months
of
privations
half
starved
and
worn
out
with
fatigue
they
reached
hakodate
where
having
no
passport
and
not
being
able
to
explain
themselves
they
were
duly
arrested
and
sent
down
to
yokohama
unfortunately
for
them
at
that
time
the
entogroul
a
turkish
had
come
to
japan
a
voyage
which
took
her
two
years
to
bring
some
decorations
which
the
sultan
had
bestowed
on
the
mikado
osman
pasha
the
admiral
had
the
poor
devils
brought
before
him
and
they
told
him
their
sad
story
what
they
had
suffered
and
how
they
had
lost
their
ship
the
story
was
too
true
to
be
believed
or
too
strange
to
sound
true
impostors
said
osman
pasha
and
declining
to
listen
any
more
to
their
tale
of
woe
which
he
called
pure
lies
had
them
put
in
irons
in
which
condition
they
were
to
be
taken
back
to
constantinople
none
of
the
foreign
residents
in
japan
believed
the
story
of
these
wretches
and
all
were
glad
to
see
the
miscreants
punished
impossible
said
everybody
that
a
turkish
ship
should
have
been
up
there
as
it
so
happened
the
entogroul
on
her
return
trip
to
constantinople
was
herself
caught
in
a
typhoon
and
steaming
full
speed
to
resist
the
force
of
the
wind
and
the
waves
her
boilers
burst
and
osman
pasha
and
nearly
all
hands
on
board
were
blown
to
pieces
or
drowned
if
i
remember
right
over
three
hundred
and
sixty
lives
were
lost
and
no
doubt
the
four
men
whose
prison
i
was
told
was
near
the
boilers
thus
found
a
tragic
end
to
their
life
of
misery
when
i
arrived
at
yokohama
all
this
had
already
happened
and
my
evidence
which
probably
might
have
saved
the
life
of
these
men
was
therefore
useless
but
let
us
return
to
soya
cape
where
we
have
left
the
wreck
the
rapid
current
which
comes
through
the
strait
gives
a
horrid
look
to
the
water
and
i
have
never
seen
the
sea
look
so
vicious
the
natives
of
the
small
soya
village
told
me
that
it
is
impossible
to
cross
over
to
sakhalin
the
high
mountains
of
which
covered
with
snow
and
glaciers
i
could
see
distinctly
the
distance
from
land
to
land
is
about
miles
but
no
small
boat
can
get
across
without
being
swamped
they
told
me
also
that
often
dead
bodies
of
russians
are
washed
on
shore
probably
unfortunate
convicts
who
found
their
death
in
attempting
to
obtain
liberty
rattler
was
wrecked
in
on
one
of
the
numerous
reefs
near
this
cape
so
the
record
of
soya
could
hardly
be
more
mournful
after
the
cape
has
been
well
rounded
one
finds
oneself
in
a
bay
opening
due
north
in
the
winter
time
this
bay
is
completely
blocked
with
ice
but
the
strait
itself
is
never
entirely
frozen
owing
to
the
strong
warm
current
from
the
chinese
sea
which
the
japanese
call
by
the
name
of
kuroshiwo
soya
village
is
a
wretched
place
of
thirty
or
forty
sheds
a
few
planks
badly
joined
together
and
with
a
kind
of
a
roof
over
them
made
my
shelter
for
the
night
soya
cape
is
the
most
northern
point
of
the
coast
and
before
we
abandon
it
to
move
towards
the
south
along
the
west
coast
it
is
important
to
mention
the
peculiar
and
conspicuous
characteristic
of
the
marked
bending
of
watercourses
in
a
south
or
direction
they
are
forced
that
way
by
the
travelling
along
the
coast
from
to
with

can
see
rishiri

near
the
western

of

are
some
small
hills
covered
mainly
with
wakkanai
a

and
north
of
it

cape
nossyap
from
this

is
a
lovely
view
of
rishiri
and
repunshiri

rishiri
is
a
volcanic
cone
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
it
has
the
identical
shape
of
the
famous
fujiama
in
southern
japan
and
rising
as
it
does
in
graceful
slopes
directly
from
the

has
the
appearance
of
being
higher
than
it
really
is
repunshiri
is
hilly
and
partly
of
volcanic
formation
but
none
of
its
peaks
rise
to
a
higher
altitude
than
five
hundred
feet
rishiri
is
almost
circular
at
and
it
has
no
nor
safe
anchorages
but
repunshiri
has
one
good
anchorage
on

repunshiri

miles
long
about
four
and
wide
and
eleven

distant
to

its
nearest
point
east
on
the
yezo
coast
as
the
kuriles
are
a
continuation
east
of
the
volcanic
zone
of
yezo
there
is
no
doubt
that
rishiri
and
repunshiri
are
the
terminus
of
the
same
volcanic
zone
at
its
end
from
wakkanai
a
new
has
been
opened
to
bakkai
on
the
coast
the
ride
for
the
first
eleven
miles
was
uncomfortable
as
my
pony
a
brute
sank
up
to
its
belly
in
the
mud
but
in
due
course
i
came
to
the
hilly
part
and
after
having
gone
up
one
steep
pitch
and
down
another
for
a
considerable
distance
i
rapidly
descended
a
precipitous
bank
and
followed
the
soft
sandy
beach
till
i
reached
bakkai
here
there
is
a
large
and
peculiar
stone
which
the
ainu
say
resembles
an
old
woman
carrying
a
child
on
her
back
it
stands
perpendicularly
out
of
the
ground
at
a
great
height
and
it
is
of
a
rich
colour
if
the
coast
was
barren
and
deserted
the
western
shore
of
yezo
was
even
yet
more
desolate
for
thirty
or
forty
miles
as
far
as
the
teshio
river
the
beach
was
strewn
with
wrecks
and
wreckage
here
you
saw
a
boat
smashed
to
pieces
there
a
mast
cast
on
the
shore
further
on
a
washed
away
by
the
waves
then
the
helm
of
a
disabled
ship
it
was
a
sight
sad
enough
to
break
one
heart
with
all
the
tragic
circumstances
it
suggested
between
bakkai
and
wadamanai
especially
i
do
not
think
that
one
can
go
more
than
a
few
yards
at
a
time
without
being
reminded
by
the
wreckage
which
is
strewn
thick
on
the
coast
of
some
calamity
a
white
with
her
stern
smashed
lay
on
the
sand
helpless
to
save
and
as
a
kind
of
satire
on
her
name
and
at
wadamanai
a
large
russian
cruiser
the
crisorok
dismasted
and
broken
in
two
lay
flat
on
the
beach
half
covered
with
sand
her
bridge
had
been
washed
away
and
her
deck
had
sunk
in
some
of
the
bodies
of
her
gallant
officers
and
crew
had
been
washed
on
shore
by
the
sea
no
one
knows
in
what
circumstances
the
ship
was
lost
but
it
is
probable
that
during
last
winter
when
she
came
to
her
end
her
rigging
and
sails
got
with
ice
and
that
she
capsized
some
of
the
wreckage
one
finds
on
that
coast
has
been
drifted
there
from
the
chinese
sea
by
the
kuroshiwo
current
and
then
owing
to
the
la
perouse
strait
turning
so
sharply
to
the
east
has
been
left
on
this
last
portion
of
the
coast
here
and
there
a
rough
tent
made
with
a
torn
sail
or
a
deserted
shed
knocked
up
out
of
pieces
of
wreckage
is
a
suggestive
reminder
that
some
unfortunate
derelict
seafarer
had
suffered
and
striven
for
life
on
these
forlorn
sands
an
enormous
quantity
of
and
here
and
there
some
bones
of
whales
are
strewn
all
along
the
beach
at
wadamanai
there
is
a
mere
rough
shed
under
the
shelter
of
the
when
i
left
this
place
moving
south
a
strong
gale
blew
which
made
the
travelling
most
unpleasant
it
was
getting
fearfully
cold
and
now
that
i
needed
clothes
so
badly
mine
were
falling
altogether
to
pieces
my
unmentionables
which
reached
down
to
my
feet
when
i
left
hakodate
at
the
beginning
of
my
journey
had
long
since
been
trimmed
and
reduced
to
a
kind
of
knickerbockers
then
the
knees
got
worn
out
and
they
became
more
like
and
finally
i
dispensed
with
them
altogether
and
made
use
of
them
to
protect
my
and
diary
round
which
i
wrapped
what
remained
of
the
my
boots
of
course
were
a
dream
of
the
past
and
little
by
little
i
was
getting
accustomed
to
walking
barefooted
thus
dressed
in
a
coat
a
belt
and
nothing
else
i
moved
along
this
inhospitable
coast
half
frozen
but
not
discomfited
the
mouths
of
some
of
the
small
rivulets
were
extremely
nasty
to
cross
as
my
pony
sank
in
the
quicksands
i
had
to
help
him
out
and
that
meant
a
cold
bath
each
time
from
wadamanai
i
kept
a
little
more
inland
still
steering
for
the
south
and
every
now
and
then
i
again
struck
the
beach
still
the
old
sad
story
of
wreckages
strewn
all
over
the
shore
sailing
boats
smashed
to
pieces
junks
disabled
and
half
buried
in
sand
met
me
at
every
turn
creating
in
my
mind
a
very
monotony
of
melancholy
late
in
the
evening
i
reached
the
mouth
of
the
teshio
river
a
broad
deep
watercourse
one
of
the
three
largest
rivers
in
hokkaido
the
other
two
being
the
ishikari
and
the
tokachi
it
has
a
long
course
in
a
general
direction
and
then
sharply
turns
southward
running
parallel
with
the
coast
for
about
four
miles
and
forming
a
kind
of
lagoon
at
its
outlet
which
seems
now
to
be
working
towards
the
northward
again
all
the
other
rivers
on
the
west
coast
tend
northward
owing
to
the
which
the
current
brings
north
it
is
strange
that
the
teshio
should
partly
be
an
exception
to
this
rule
though
we
have
ample
evidence
even
in
this
watercourse
of
the
movement
of
the
sand
for
the
bar
at
its
mouth
almost
entirely
blocks
its
entrance
and
rapidly
works
in
a
northerly
direction
thus
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
sand
travels
towards
the
north
all
along
the
west
coast
is
abundant
in
the
teshio
river
but
salmon
with
which
this
stream
formerly
abounded
are
now
less
plentiful
owing
to
the
which
blocks
the
entrance
a
gale
was
blowing
fiercely
when
i
crossed
the
lagoon
in
a
small
ainu
and
my
pony
was
made
to
swim
across
two
or
three
times
we
nearly
capsized
and
we
shipped
a
lot
of
water
it
was
just
like
sitting
in
a
bath
with
water
up
to
my
waist
but
the
ainu
who
had
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
paddle
me
across
and
tow
the
pony
as
well
comforted
me
by
saying
now
that
his
was
full
we
could
not
ship
any
more
water
and
that
his
skiff
being
made
of
wood
could
not
sink
after
a
long
struggle
we
got
safely
to
the
other
side
and
the
ainu
boatman
guided
me
for
a
mile
or
so
to
the
fishing
village
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
it
has
but
ten
huts
all
more
or
less
miserable
the
pony
was
so
done
up
that
he
was
hardly
fit
to
carry
my
traps
much
less
could
he
have
borne
my
weight
i
could
not
get
a
fresh
animal
so
i
had
to
push
forward
walking
and
dragging
the
beast
on
as
well
as
i
could
this
had
the
advantage
of
keeping
me
warm
which
i
needed
badly
for
what
with
the
cold
and
my
dilapidated
costume
i
was
more
nearly
frozen
to
death
than
was
pleasant
the
track
was
heavy
in
the
soft
sand
and
the
dangerous
and
numerous
quicksand
streams
were
enough
to
make
a
saint
swear
if
swearing
would
have
done
any
good
how
unspeakably
desolate
it
all
was
not
a
soul
to
be
met
not
a
hut
to
be
seen
here
and
there
more
wreckage
and
on
the
shore
telling
of
storms
and
death
and
the
absence
of
all
human
aid
at
last
i
came
in
sight
of
an
ainu
hut
but
as
i
drew
near
i
found
that
it
was
abandoned
my
meals
never
very
plentiful
were
now
specially
scanty
few
and
far
between
and
taken
altogether
this
part
of
my
travels
in
ainuland
was
somewhat
lacking
in
cheerfulness
the
cliffs
near
wembets
have
the
strange
appearance
of
so
many
cones
at
equal
intervals
along
the
coast
on
the
wembets
river
there
were
as
many
as
two
huts
and
here
again
i
had
to
cross
in
a
boat
the
stream
being
too
deep
to
ford
on
foot
or
horseback
then
again
along
the
sand
dragging
my
pony
while
i
myself
could
hardly
stand
on
my
feet
i
went
on
and
on
wearied
of
the
monotony
of
my
miserable
experiences
the
track
grew
narrow
and
always
worse
the
high
grey
cliffs
of
began
and
the
rough
sea
washed
up
to
the
foot
of
them
making
progress
more
than
ever
unpleasant
and
dangerous
each
wave
that
came
brought
the
water
up
to
my
knees
often
up
to
my
waist
and
for
about
ten
miles
i
was
continually
in
and
out
of
water
on
a
cold
day
my
readers
can
imagine
how
pleasant
it
was
about
sunset
i
came
in
sight
of
the
two
flat
islands
of
teuri
and
yangeshiri
about
fifteen
miles
off
the
coast
it
then
grew
dark
but
the
moon
came
to
my
help
shining
brightly
on
the
greyish
cliffs
the
tide
had
risen
and
in
several
places
i
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
across
on
account
of
the
furious
waves
dashing
against
the
cliffs
and
making
a
picturesque
and
living
sheet
of
foam
late
at
night
as
i
had
almost
given
up
all
hope
of
finding
a
shelter
i
came
upon
a
shed
on
the
furembets
river
where
i
put
up
for
the
night
my
wretched
pony
was
nearly
dead
with
fatigue
and
i
let
him
loose
so
that
he
might
get
a
feed
of
grass
the
next
morning
after
the
inmates
of
the
hut
had
volunteered
to
go
and
bring
him
back
to
me
i
heard
them
on
the
distant
hills
calling
pop
pop
pop
the
ainu
way
of
approaching
and
calling
horses
after
a
time
they
came
back
hopeless
saying
that
the
brute
had
bolted
and
there
was
no
hope
of
getting
him
again
he
could
not
be
found
anywhere
i
was
in
the
most
awful
dilemma
for
had
that
been
the
case
i
would
have
been
forced
to
abandon
all
my
impedimenta
consisting
of
sketches
and
painting
materials
and
proceed
as
best
i
could
on
foot
under
other
circumstances
i
could
have
carried
the
baggage
on
my
back
easily
but
as
i
was
and
had
my
feet
badly
cut
i
was
hardly
able
to
carry
my
own
weight
therefore
this
was
not
possible
now
as
incredulity
is
one
of
the
useful
qualities
i
possess
i
went
to
look
after
my
pony
myself
the
shed
was
protected
by
a
at
the
back
and
a
small
space
was
left
between
the
mound
and
the
wall
of
the
shed
i
do
not
know
what
made
me
go
and
look
there
but
sure
enough
there
was
my
pony
lying
flat
and
almost
too
weak
to
get
up
again
this
was
no
ruse
on
the
part
of
the
ainu
simply
the
wretched
animal
own
idea
of
good
stabling
and
likely
fodder
i
dragged
him
out
of
his
involuntary
prison
and
after
having
done
what
i
could
for
his
comfort
and
we
set
out
once
more
on
our
melancholy
travels
this
may
sound
cruel
to
some
who
in
the
course
of
their
life
have
never
travelled
in
places
and
who
are
ready
to
condemn
anyone
who
is
the
means
of
letting
an
animal
suffer
it
may
sound
cruel
in
our
humane
country
where
animals
are
protected
and
tolerated
and
enjoyed
so
to
avoid
misunderstandings
it
might
be
as
well
for
me
to
say
that
as
regards
this
tired
pony
it
was
simply
the
matter
to
push
on
with
him
as
far
as
i
could
or
lose
all
the
valuable
materials
i
had
collected
during
months
of
sufferings
and
privations
no
ponies
were
to
be
got
for
any
money
along
that
deserted
coast
for
there
were
none
in
existence
i
did
my
best
to
alleviate
the
poor
animal
sufferings
by
undergoing
myself
a
considerable
amount
of
pain
walking
most
of
the
way
with
my
feet
a
mass
of
sores
and
as
winter
was
rapidly
coming
on
i
was
more
than
anxious
to
make
my
way
south
with
all
the
speed
i
could
to
prevent
being
blocked
up
with
snow
and
ice
and
forced
to
spend
the
winter
on
this
inhospitable
coast
consequently
i
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
more
cruel
to
myself
than
to
my
animals
to
the
others
those
who
will
still
cast
the
first
stone
at
me
i
can
wish
no
better
punishment
than
to
be
placed
in
the
same
position
i
was
then
the
trail
became
somewhat
better
as
it
led
over
the
cliffs
for
about
three
miles
then
again
it
was
on
the
beach
the
high
cliffs
varied
from
a
very
rich
burnt
sienna
colour
to
a
nice
warm
grey
and
in
some
places
they
are
perfectly
white
like
the
cliffs
at
dover
conical
mounds
frequently
occur
and
give
a
curious
aspect
to
this
deserted
shore
ten
miles
further
on
at
chukbets
i
found
a
couple
of
huts
then
i
walked
and
dragged
the
pony
on
the
cliffs
for
about
four
miles
then
again
i
resorted
to
the
beach
and
finally
i
entered
hamboro
a
small
village
or
rather
a
picturesque
group
of
sheds
and
huts
and
a
capital
salmon
and
herrings
are
caught
in
abundance
at
the
mouth
of
this
river
a
short
distance
from
here
hundreds
of
carcasses
of
seals
were
scattered
on
the
beach
whence
emanated
pestilential
odours
on
account
of
the
slowness
of
my
pony
i
had
a
modified
repetition
of
last
night
experience
but
neither
was
the
sea
so
rough
nor
the
trail
so
narrow
at
the
bottom
of
the
cliffs
and
though
my
wretched
animal
was
naturally
in
a
worse
condition
than
before
i
was
able
to
push
on
to
tomamai
that
same
night
where
i
arrived
at
a
small
hour
of
the
morning
at
tomamai
the
coast
which
had
described
a
long
curve
the
two
ends
of
which
are
ikuru
north
and
this
point
south
turns
sharply
in
a
southerly
direction
running
straight
for
many
miles
from
north
to
south
from
tomamai
southwards
the
coast
is
not
quite
as
deserted
as
it
was
further
north
for
here
and
there
are
villages
of
fishermen
houses
the
population
however
is
a
migratory
one
and
when
i
went
through
the
season
was
over
and
consequently
most
of
the
houses
were
abandoned
and
the
people
had
migrated
south
the
winter
weather
is
very
severe
and
the
houses
have
to
be
barricaded
with
thick
piles
of
wood
as
a
protection
against
the
strong
westerly
gales
the
boats
had
been
drawn
far
on
shore
where
they
were
well
fastened
to
posts
and
rough
sheds
thatched
with
grass
built
over
them
along
the
coast
there
was
a
string
of
these
habitations
hut
after
hut
storehouse
after
storehouse
but
hardly
a
soul
to
be
seen
it
was
like
going
through
the
city
of
the
dead
many
of
the
fishermen
huts
were
built
on
the
side
of
the
rugged
cliffs
and
they
stood
on
piles
about
fifteen
feet
high
the
back
of
the
house
resting
on
the
cliff
itself
twelve
and
a
half
miles
further
another
row
of
houses
similarly
deserted
for
the
winter
stood
along
the
at
onishika
in
this
part
of
the
coast
salmon
are
very
scarce
and
the
chief
industry
is
the
herring
fishery
there
are
no
ainu
to
be
found
either
at
tomamai
or
onishika
i
continued
my
lonesome
ride
in
the
pouring
rain
and
soon
came
to
a
peculiar
long
tunnel
natural
and
partly
excavated
between
this
place
and
rumoi
a
village
prettily
situated
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
fifteen
miles
further
this
place
possesses
a
small
anchorage
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
which
is
now
only
fit
for
junks
and
small
but
could
be
considerably
improved
good
coal
has
been
discovered
some
way
up
the
river
there
is
a
track
on
the
cliffs
leading
to
mashike
all
along
the
coast
are
any
number
of
fishermen
houses
but
they
were
all
closed
and
barricaded
ultimately
descending
from
the
cliffs
in
a
fashion
after
another
ten
miles
ride
i
found
myself
at
mashike
the
largest
japanese
village
in
the
teshio
district
close
to
the
tunnel
there
is
a
small
ainu
village
where
the
natives
let
their
hair
grow
very
long
and
then
tie
it
up
in
a
kind
of
knot
similar
to
the
corean
fashion
of
while
the
women
have
given
up
tattooing
altogether
the
fishermen
at
mashike
seem
to
suffer
greatly
from
or
rheumatism
and
cancer
while
consumption
malarial
fever
and
typhus
are
in
a
small
proportion
i
had
to
stop
over
one
day
at
mashike
for
the
river
was
swollen
by
the
heavy
rains
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
across
on
the
other
side
of
it
stood
a
huge
volcanic
mountain
rising
sheer
from
the
sea
and
forming
cape
kamuieto
under
the
shelter
of
which
lies
mashike
village
and
further
south
cape
uhui
projects
into
the
sea
it
is
the
end
of
a
mountain
range
which
here
runs
north
and
then
south
again
in
the
latter
part
forming
one
side
of
the
upper
basin
of
the
teshio
river
mashike
is
the
largest
settlement
either
on
the
or
west
coast
of
yezo
its
population
is
partly
migratory
but
not
so
wholly
as
is
the
case
with
the
villages
i
had
previously
passed
i
was
delayed
still
another
day
owing
to
the
condition
of
the
river
for
the
rain
instead
of
decreasing
poured
down
to
such
an
extent
that
the
stream
could
not
be
crossed
the
current
being
too
swift
and
the
water
too
deep
the
sea
was
also
too
rough
to
allow
of
my
leaving
mashike
in
a
canoe
on
the
third
day
i
rose
early
and
decided
to
attempt
this
crossing
of
the
river
it
had
not
rained
during
the
night
and
the
waters
seemed
to
have
slightly
diminished
as
the
stream
runs
down
a
very
steep
incline
on
the
slopes
of
mashike
mountain
the
current
rushes
with
tremendous
force
it
was
about
five
in
the
morning
when
i
took
my
baggage
to
the
river
bank
it
was
made
up
in
two
bundles
which
i
tied
together
firmly
with
a
leather
strap
some
of
the
natives
who
had
collected
round
me
entreated
me
to
give
up
this
foolish
idea
for
they
said
i
should
infallibly
lose
my
life
if
i
attempted
to
wade
across
the
swollen
river
i
saw
at
once
that
my
pony
would
never
be
able
to
cross
so
i
left
him
and
taking
the
baggage
on
my
head
and
passing
my
hands
through
the
strap
i
went
into
the
water
the
current
was
indeed
so
strong
that
weak
as
i
was
i
could
hardly
stand
against
it
i
had
nearly
reached
the
middle
with
the
water
up
to
my
mouth
when
i
fancied
i
heard
the
anxious
crowd
scream
to
me
abunai
abunai
look
out
look
out
look
out
startled
and
alarmed
at
this
piercing
cry
i
turned
my
head
and
saw
within
a
few
yards
of
me
a
huge
trunk
of
a
tree
coming
swiftly
down
with
the
current
there
was
a
bump
and
i
saw
nothing
more
half
a
minute
later
i
was
violently
thrown
on
the
opposite
bank
and
in
trying
to
stand
up
on
my
feet
in
the
shallow
water
my
right
foot
unfortunately
got
jammed
between
two
stones
in
the
river
bed
i
was
knocked
down
again
and
broke
my
just
under
the
ankle
several
natives
came
to
my
rescue
and
i
was
lifted
out
of
the
water
but
still
holding
fast
to
my
load
i
was
nearly
frozen
and
trembling
like
a
leaf
from
cold
when
i
tried
to
stand
my
right
leg
collapsed
and
i
had
to
lie
down
on
the
ground
what
with
the
blow
which
i
had
received
from
the
floating
wood
what
with
the
muddy
water
i
had
involuntarily
swallowed
it
took
me
some
minutes
before
i
could
quite
understand
my
situation
or
what
had
befallen
me
when
i
did
i
felt
a
terrible
pain
in
my
right
leg
i
looked
and
there
on
the
sand
under
my
foot
and
leg
which
were
swollen
up
to
an
enormous
size
was
a
pool
of
blood
the
broken
bone
had
penetrated
the
skin
and
was
exposed
to
the
air
when
i
recovered
my
senses
well
enough
i
got
a
man
to
tear
the
wet
lining
of
my
drenched
coat
and
with
it
and
a
few
improvised
splints
i
proceeded
to
set
my
own
broken
bone
it
was
hard
work
but
with
the
help
of
some
natives
i
bandaged
it
up
as
well
as
i
could
and
with
the
extra
help
of
a
coarse
flaxen
rope
i
made
a
fairly
good
surgical
job
of
the
whole
thing
stopping
there
till
i
grew
better
would
have
been
foolish
for
winter
was
setting
in
everything
would
soon
be
frozen
and
snowed
up
and
far
from
all
my
friends
as
well
as
from
anything
like
civilised
life
or
elementary
comforts
as
i
was
i
should
probably
have
died
as
long
as
i
had
a
spark
of
life
left
in
me
i
decided
that
i
would
struggle
and
push
on
come
what
might
two
men
undertook
to
carry
me
over
the
mashike
mountain
which
rises
to
an
altitude
of
feet
above
the
the
mountain
is
thickly
wooded
and
the
trail
is
steep
heavy
and
in
many
places
dangerous
and
when
we
reached
a
sufficient
altitude
the
trail
was
merely
in
the
bed
of
a
rivulet
composed
mainly
of
huge
stones
travelling
in
the
state
in
which
i
was
was
something
like
going
to
one
own
funeral
the
jerking
and
the
cold
were
excruciating
the
continuous
stumbling
and
unsteady
walk
of
my
men
over
the
rough
and
slippery
slopes
did
not
improve
my
condition
but
finally
we
reached
the
summit
what
a
lovely
view
one
could
see
far
along
the
teshio
coast
on
the
one
side
and
down
towards
the
ishikari
on
the
other
and
towards
the
east
rose
up
a
picturesque
chain
of
mountains
rising
from
the
sea
stood
the
fine
cape
airup
near
moi
then
far
beyond
dimly
seen
in
the
mist
was
the
towering
outline
of
shakotan
we
went
down
the
other
side
and
my
men
poor
fellows
did
their
best
to
cheer
me
up
one
of
them
told
me
a
cheering
story
of
a
grizzly
bear
which
by
the
way
he
said
were
numberless
on
this
mountain
that
had
killed
and
eaten
two
children
and
also
their
father
when
the
latter
went
to
their
rescue
the
other
told
me
of
the
many
men
who
had
perished
in
crossing
the
mountain
some
had
been
overtaken
by
a
snowstorm
others
had
lost
their
way
and
fallen
over
precipices
while
others
again
had
been
killed
by
avalanches
in
winter
listening
to
this
lively
conversation
shaken
and
suffering
i
arrived
late
at
night
at
moi
having
been
carried
over
a
distance
of
miles
to
do
which
occupied
about
eighteen
hours
there
was
no
possible
way
of
getting
across
the
mountains
between
here
and
atzta
as
the
high
granitic
perpendicular
cliffs
are
unscalable
and
i
was
bound
to
entrust
my
life
to
a
small
ainu
canoe
two
other
passengers
a
japanese
woman
and
a
man
asked
if
i
would
allow
them
to
travel
in
the
boat
with
me
and
then
we
three
rowed
by
an
ainu
man
put
out
to
sea
the
sea
was
rough
outside
but
as
the
large
bay
was
well
protected
by
the
aikap
cape
all
went
right
at
first
but
in
rounding
the
point
we
went
too
near
the
rocks
got
caught
in
a
breaker
and
shipped
so
much
water
that
the
canoe
began
to
slowly
sink
under
the
additional
weight
the
ainu
was
pretty
smart
and
he
put
his
skiff
on
the
rocks
between
him
and
the
two
passengers
i
was
helped
out
and
while
the
ainu
emptied
the
canoe
the
two
japanese
undressed
entirely
and
spread
out
all
their
clothes
and
underclothes
in
the
sun
to
dry
we
got
on
board
again
and
coasting
more
carefully
passed
several
small
fishing
villages
of
which
gokibira
is
the
largest
and
most
important
it
is
backed
by
high
mountains
ranging
from
twelve
hundred
to
seventeen
hundred
and
more
feet
above
the
sea
one
of
the
mountains
the
highest
is
called
atzta
is
a
long
narrow
village
of
which
almost
all
the
houses
are
built
against
the
cliff
from
here
i
had
to
begin
riding
again
along
the
bad
and
stony
coast
among
and
up
and
down
cliffs
anyone
who
has
ever
had
any
broken
bones
will
appreciate
the
tortures
which
i
had
to
go
through
owing
to
pain
exhaustion
and
fatigue
i
had
no
control
over
my
pony
and
could
hardly
stick
on
to
the
saddle
i
took
the
precaution
of
tying
the
bridle
to
my
wrist
for
should
the
pony
knock
me
off
he
could
not
bolt
away
but
unhappily
sometimes
this
was
the
means
of
his
dragging
me
mercilessly
on
the
ground
for
dozens
of
yards
before
he
would
stop
then
i
had
to
wait
for
some
charitable
to
help
me
into
the
saddle
again
for
i
could
no
longer
mount
by
myself
day
after
day
of
this
wretched
life
made
me
feel
almost
unconscious
that
i
had
a
pain
i
took
things
as
they
came
and
i
went
on
now
that
i
sit
here
in
a
comfortable
chair
writing
this
by
a
cosy
fire
i
am
myself
astonished
at
my
own
perseverance
if
i
were
called
upon
to
go
through
the
same
experience
now
i
could
not
but
in
truth
there
are
many
things
that
one
does
not
mind
doing
for
motives
of
pleasure
which
one
would
never
dream
of
attempting
under
the
compulsion
of
an
external
will
kutambets
is
picturesquely
situated
in
a
large
gully
formed
by
a
break
in
the
cliffs
from
kutambets
to
moroi
the
track
is
slightly
better
and
from
this
to
ishikari
it
is
quite
easy
the
latter
river
a
very
large
one
has
to
be
crossed
by
a
ferry
as
the
habitations
are
on
the
south
banks
of
the

chapter

the
ishikari
river
on
the
north
side
of
the
mouth
of
the
ishikari
river
is
an
ainu
village
called
raishats
its
inhabitants
are
not
natives
of
this
island
but
were
imported
by
the
japanese
government
from
sakhalin
when
it
was
exchanged
with
russia
for
the
kuriles
at
the
entrance
of
the
river
and
close
to
this
village
another
wreck
of
the
kamida
maru
a
schooner
ended
the
mournful
list
of
disasters
on
this
inhospitable
coast
the
ainu
of
raishats
are
different
in
some
ways
from
the
yezo
ainu
proper
they
call
themselves
kraftu
ainu
kraftu
being
the
ainu
name
for
sakhalin
their
skin
is
of
a
lighter
colour
but
the
principal
difference
is
in
their
eyes
and
eyebrows
the
kraftu
ainu
have
eyes
of
the
mongolian
type
though
larger
while
the
yezo
ainu
have
not
and
their
eyebrows
have
a
very
pronounced
curve
near
the
nose
most
of
the
women
seemed
to
suffer
from
consumption
and
the
men
also
did
not
seem
as
strong
as
the
other
ainu
the
women
tattoo
on
their
lips
a
small
square
pattern
instead
of
the
long
moustache
and
most
of
them
have
now
adopted
japanese
or
else
wear
gowns
similar
to
those
of
russian
peasants
some
also
wear
skin
gowns
similar
to
those
of
the
kurilsky
ainu
ornamented
with
feathers
and
bits
of
molten
lead
sewn
on
them
a
velvet
cap
or
a
kind
of
tiara
is
their
and
this
also
is
ornamented
with
gold
and
silver
or
red
beads
or
else
is
embroidered
in
bright
colours
sometimes
also
pronounced
the
children
are
arrayed
in
more
gaudy
colours
than
their
elders
they
have
bright
red
embroideries
round
their
necks
and
the
whole
gown
is
full
of
spangles
and
beads
the
proceeds
of
parental
barter
a
peculiar
which
i
saw
here
for
the
first
time
was
ingenious
and
answered
a
great
want
in
the
ainu
country
as
will
be
seen
later
the
majority
of
ainu
children
have
huge
paunches
mostly
due
to
the
inability
of
the
hairy
people
to
tie
and
secure
properly
the
umbilical
cord
at
the
child
birth
this
not
only
produces
great
discomfort
to
the
child
but
often
causes
its
death
the
belt
which
i
saw
was
made
on
the
principle
that
the
weight
of
the
paunch
under
which
passed
a
kind
of
net
made
of
strips
of
skin
was
supported
by
braces
going
over
the
shoulders
and
by
this
contrivance
if
the
original
lesion
did
not
get
much
better
it
did
not
get
worse
as
it
does
when
not
taken
any
care
of
at
all
neither
men
nor
women
wore
earrings
but
the
fair
sex
wore
a
kind
of
velvet
ribbon
necklace
round
their
neck
and
on
this
ribbon
were
sewn
ornaments
of
molten
lead
silver
and
other
metals
the
habitations
storehouses
and
customs
of
these
ainu
are
similar
to
those
of
the
others
as
i
slowly
rode
along
the
banks
of
the
river
just
before
sunset
retracing
my
steps
towards
the
ishikari
village
i
saw
a
hidden
trail
which
apparently
led
to
the
woods
i
made
my
pony
follow
it
and
shortly
afterwards
i
came
to
a
graveyard
as
i
have
said
the
ainu
are
extremely
jealous
of
their
and
they
resent
strangers
even
japanese
going
near
them
it
was
nearly
fifteen
days
since
the
accident
to
my
leg
had
occurred
and
though
i
could
neither
walk
nor
stand
on
it
still
i
was
beginning
to
be
accustomed
to
the
agony
and
with
great
trouble
and
pain
i
could
dismount
from
my
tiny
pony
strange
to
say
mounting
was
not
so
difficult
for
i
could
pull
myself
up
with
my
arms
lie
flat
on
my
stomach
on
the
saddle
and
then
swing
round
and
it
did
not
jar
me
as
much
as
coming
down
i
had
my
fastened
to
the
saddle
and
i
unlashed
it
to
take
a
sketch
the
tombs
were
so
many
trunks
of
trees
cut
and
carved
and
with
one
branch
left
on
one
side
chapter
one
tomb
particularly
was
more
ornamented
and
it
had
a
monument
roughly
but
well
carved
at
its
head
an
object
resembling
the
bottom
of
a
covered
the
body
and
this
was
also
carved
at
each
of
the
four
corners
a
wooden
blade
was
stuck
in
the
ground
from
the
stench
i
should
think
that
the
body
was
only
a
few
inches
underground
fate
had
punished
me
so
severely
of
late
for
faults
which
i
never
committed
that
i
thought
myself
now
entitled
to
commit
a
fault
for
the
sake
of
squaring
accounts
one
of
the
small
wooden
blades
nicely
carved
would
just
go
under
my
coat
i
decided
to
steal
it
to
my
mind
it
was
hardly
a
big
enough
crime
even
to
balance
the
last
accident
i
had
had
i
turned
round
to
see
that
no
one
was
looking
i
put
down
my
crawled
to
the
grave
took
the
blade
put
it
under
my
coat
and
ashamed
of
myself
for
committing
the
outrage
though
with
prepaid
punishment
i
scrambled
up
on
my
pony
as
well
i
could
and
hurriedly
left
the
place
i
rode
back
to
the
ferry
a
long
way
off
and
went
across
to
ishikari
and
catching
a
moment
when
no
one
was
watching
me
i
quickly
passed
the
carved
blade
from
under
my
coat
into
my
baggage
what
a
good
thief
i
would
make
i
thought
to
myself
when
to
my
horror
i
remembered
that
in
the
hurry
of
leaving
the
graveyard
i
had
forgotten
my
in
the
very
same
spot
from
which
i
had
taken
the
blade
if
any
ainu
had
gone
to
the
graveyard
and
found
it
i
would
get
into
a
nice
mess
during
the
night
i
felt
more
than
uncomfortable
about
it
and
at
dawn
the
next
morning
i
got
the
man
to
bring
my
horse
and
set
me
on
it
for
i
said
i
wish
to
go
and
see
the
sunrise
from
the
other
side
of
the
river
the
landlord
thought
it
rather
funny
and
funnier
still
when
he
saw
me
coming
back
a
couple
of
hours
later
with
a
lashed
to
my
saddle
while
he
said
he
was
sure
i
had
started
without
one
did
you
not
see
it
this
morning
said
i
with
assumed
innocence
no
your
honourable
said
he
drawing
in
his
breath
you
did
not
look
for
it
in
the
right
place
said
i
and
up
to
this
day
the
landlord
does
not
know
where
the
right
place
was
the
ishikari
is
one
of
the
great
salmon
rivers
of
yezo
about
the
end
of
september
the
salmon
enter
the
river
to
spawn
they
are
in
such
abundance
then
that
the
stream
is
crowded
thick
with
them
and
it
is
quite
sufficient
to
have
a
hook
fastened
to
a
stick
to
pull
out
a
large
fish
each
time
it
is
dipped
into
the
water
millions
of
fine
salmon
are
caught
within
a
few
days
and
the
banks
of
the
river
are
packed
with
dead
fish
while
the
whole
population
is
occupied
in
splitting
open
each
fish
taking
out
its
inside
for
preservation
the
same
method
of
netting
as
is
practised
for
sardine
fishing
is
employed
for
salmon
eighteen
or
twenty
excited
men
vigorously
row
the
boats
out
into
and
after
describing
a
semicircle
return
to
the
bank
the
nets
are
hauled
in
the
fish
flung
out
on
the
river
banks
and
the
same
process
begins
a
man
in
a
watches
when
the
salmon
are
more
or
less
plentiful
and
signals
for
the
boat
to
start
while
he
himself
spears
them
with
a
harpoon
at
the
right
time
of
the
year
as
many
as
or
and
more
good
fish
are
caught
each
time
the
net
is
hauled
in
this
grand
take
of
course
only
lasts
a
few
days
though
good
the
yezo
salmon
has
none
of
the
fine
qualities
of
the
salmon
of
northern
european
rivers
and
it
is
not
quite
so
good
as
that
of
the
canadian
rivers
it
does
not
keep
so
well
and
in
colour
is
much
lighter
than
our
salmon
the
ishikari
river
opens
to
the
north
and
runs
parallel
to
the
coast
leaving
a
flat
tongue
of
sand
between
it
and
the
sea
following
the
course
of
the
stream
against
the
current
it
goes
winding
south
then
sharply
turns
to
the
following
this
direction
for
about
fourteen
miles
then
again
it
winds
up
to
the
north
and
then
to
the
east
for
a
distance
of
over
one
hundred
miles
where
its
source
lies
in
the
very
heart
of
yezo
the
ishikari
carries
a
large
body
of
water
and
it
is
nine
hundred
and
twenty
feet
wide
near
its
mouth
its
drainage
area
has
been
estimated
to
be
over
three
thousand
square
miles
including
mountain
slopes
while
the
actual
valley
does
not
in
my
opinion
exceed
eight
hundred
square
miles
the
river
receives
many
affluents
of
which
the
most
important
are
the
rubeshibe
chupets
piegawa
the
sorachi
river
and
the
toyohira
on
its
south
side
and
the
uriugawa
on
its
north
side
near
the
coast
the
valley
is
wooded
mainly
with
scrub
oak
but
further
inland
its
banks
are
heavily
timbered
the
sorachi
river
is
the
most
important
affluent
on
the
south
side
it
is
navigable
for
and
small
sailing
boats
for
some
considerable
distance
at
sorachi
one
strikes
the
new
road
which
leads
from
the
poronai
coal
mines
to
kamikawa
where
the
site
has
been
chosen
for
the
intended
new
capital
of
hokkaido
the
road
between
sorachi
and
the
latter
place
not
being
metalled
was
exceedingly
bad
owing
to
the
heavy
rains
and
my
pony
continually
sank
in
mud
up
to
his
belly
the
road
follows
the
course
of
the
ishikari
river
more
or
less
and
in
the
woods
is
a
military
settlement
like
those
we
have
seen
near
nemuro
and
akkeshi
at
otoyebukets
the
traveller
must
change
horses
about
eight
miles
further
on
one
reaches
the
kamuikotan
rapids
a
poetic
spot
huge
rocks
in
the
water
violently
rushing
between
and
over
them
form
pretty
waterfalls
the
ainu
occasionally
shoot
down
these
rapids
in
their
and
remains
of
these
are
to
be
seen
here
and
there
smashed
on
the
rocks
from
this
point
the
road
rises
almost
all
the
way
and
the
wayfarer
must
cross
over
the
hill
range
from
the
top
of
which
the
whole
plain
of
kamikawa
can
be
seen
in
the
upper
basin
of
the
ishikari
which
winding
like
a
silver
snake
intersects
the
flat
valley
descending
the
hill
on
the
other
side
i
reached
the
future
capital
of
hokkaido
it
is
indeed
a
town
of
the
future
for
at
the
present
moment
there
are
only
five
houses
if
i
may
call
them
so
the
site
of
this
embryo
metropolis
is
by
the
chubets
river
and
on
the
hill
called
nayosami
i
was
told
a
palace
for
the
emperor
is
to
be
erected
however
they
were
not
certain
about
it
yet
it
is
a
pretty
hill
almost
in
the
centre
of
the
large
plain
and
from
the
top
of
it
one
gets
a
lovely
view
of
a
volcanic
cone
standing
in
front
of
you
to
the
south
near
this
hill
the
new
road
turns
sharply
almost
at
a
right
angle
and
two
miles
further
some
have
been
begun
hundreds
of
convicts
who
by
the
way
have
made
the
road
between
here
and
poronai
were
at
work
continuing
the
same
road
towards
the
east
i
believe
that
eventually
it
will
be
prolonged
to
the
coast
where
it
will
end
near
abashiri
in
my
opinion
the
scheme
practically
will
be
a
failure
for
kamikawa
will
never
be
a
flourishing
place
as
there
is
nothing
to
support
a
large
population
from
a
strategic
point
of
view
of
course
kamikawa
has
the
advantage
of
being
in
the
centre
of
yezo
kamikawa
is
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
but
it
is
well
sheltered
and
the
climate
though
very
cold
is
not
quite
so
severe
as
in
other
parts
of
yezo
the
ainu
of
the
upper
ishikari
are
nearly
the
same
as
the
saru
ainu
only
somewhat
taller
and
more
they
show
greater
skill
than
other
ainu
in
and
general
ornamentation
along
the
banks
of
the
river
huts
are
scattered
here
and
there
but
the
largest
number
is
at
chubets
at
the
present
moment
the
japanese
population
of
kamikawa
is
with
the
exception
of
policemen
and
as
many
civilians
composed
entirely
of
convicts
these
are
dressed
in
red
coats
and
trousers
and
those
who
have
committed
murder
have
the
top
of
their
head
shaved
in
the
shape
of
a
bottle
if
any
misbehave
they
are
beaten
with
the
flat
side
of
the
long
sword
worn
by
the
policeman
in
charge
but
i
must
confess
that
otherwise
the
policemen
are
extremely
kind
in
every
way
to
these
fellows
the
have
one
two
or
three
small
pieces
of
black
cloth
sewn
to
their
left
sleeve
they
are
made
to
work
hard
but
save
this
enforced
diligence
they
seem
to
have
a
pretty
good
time
as
i
was
talking
to
a
policeman
in
charge
two
dead
men
were
brought
on
a
cart
by
a
man
who
had
a
towel
over
his
mouth
and
a
red
blanket
over
his
head
the
two
men
had
died
suddenly
they
had
arrived
only
a
few
days
previously
from
southern
japan
where
cholera
was
raging
and
they
had
all
the
symptoms
of
having
died
of
that
deadly
disease
a
very
exciting
way
of
retracing
your
steps
down
to
the
sorachi
river
is
to
shoot
the
rapids
in
an
ainu
you
make
one
or
two
ainu
moderately
drunk
as
otherwise
they
do
not
seem
anxious
to
attempt
it
and
when
they
are
in
that
condition
you
get
them
to
paddle
your
canoe
down
the
stream
while
you
sit
in
the
bottom
holding
on
to
the
sides
you
start
with
the
velocity
of
a
turtle
increase
it
to
that
of
a
horse
then
to
that
of
a
swallow
and
when
you
are
well
in
the
rapids
it
is
like
travelling
on
an
arrow
you
go
rubbing
against
rocks
and
are
shot
in
the
air
when
going
over
a
small
waterfall
only
to
fall
with
a
splash
in
the
water
some
yards
further
with
an
increase
of
velocity
as
you
go
on
it
really
requires
but
little
skill
to
navigate
rapids
for
it
is
the
current
itself
that
does
all
the
work
all
that
is
needed
is
to
keep
the
straight
in
the
water
of
course
if
you
should
happen
to
collide
with
a
rock
when
you
are
going
at
nearly
double
the
rate
of
an
express
train
you
would
have
little
chance
of
saving
your
life
but
if
you
are
neither
smashed
nor
drowned
and
you
do
not
come
to
grief
in
any
way
you
can
accomplish
the
journey
which
takes
you
the
whole
day
by
land
in
little
over
one
hour
when
there
is
plenty
of
water
in
the
stream
on
the
road
from
sorachi
to
poronai
and
halfway
between
the
villages
of
naye
and
takigawa
a
new
coal
mine
has
been
discovered
and
opened
which
is
said
to
be
very
rich
in
mineral
of
good
quality
in
fact
superior
to
the
coal
of
poronai
it
is
ten
miles
from
otaussi
nai
village
where
the
high
road
has
to
be
abandoned
if
the
mine
is
to
be
visited
there
are
many
ainu
both
at
village
at
otaussi
and
at
poronai
has
in
its
neighbourhood
some
rich
coal
mines
as
others
have
reported
more
accurately
and
correctly
than
i
can
on
the
quality
and
extent
of
these
coal
seams
i
shall
abstain
from
repeating
or
copying
what
has
been
already
said
i
may
however
mention
that
the
seams
cut
the
valley
of
the
ikusum
river
eight
miles
from
and
a
continuation
of
them
is
found
near
the
springs
of
the
sorachi
the
coal
beds
of
poronai
are
about
three
and
a
half
feet
deep
and
many
different
beds
have
been
found
deeper
than
these
but
of
inferior
quality
poronai
also
goes
by
the
name
of
ishikishiri
and
a
large
penitentiary
has
been
erected
here
for
the
accommodation
of
the
numerous
convicts
exported
from
the
main
island
to
improve
the
scheme
for
the
colonisation
of
yezo
i
was
called
on
by
the
chief
officer
and
he
expressed
a
wish
that
i
should
inspect
the
prisons
a
splendid
horse
was
sent
to
convey
me
thither
and
two
policemen
helped
me
on
my
progress
through
the
buildings
owing
to
my
inability
to
walk
more
than
a
few
yards
at
a
time
it
was
a
large
walled
enclosure
with
houses
for
the
officials
and
cells
for
the
a
jocular
term
meaning
babies
which
is
applied
to
convicts
because
they
wear
red
clothes
like
children
the
buildings
were
beautifully
clean
but
what
astonished
me
most
was
that
no
precaution
whatever
was
adopted
to
prevent
convicts
from
escaping
the
outside
gates
were
all
wide
open
there
were
neither
soldiers
nor
policemen
at
the
gates
and
moreover
the
was
himself
a
convict
but
said
i
do
not
many
of
these
fellows
escape
oh
no
not
many
last
month
only
sixteen
ran
away
was
the
answer
of
my
guide
from
to
sappro
there
is
a
small
railway
by
which
the
coal
trains
are
run

chapter

nearing
civilisation
sappro
the
present
capital
of
hokkaido
is
a
town
of
fairly
large
size
with
wide
streets
intersecting
each
other
at
right
angles
the
a
high
building
the
law
courts
the
the
palace
built
for
the
emperor
and
used
now
as
a
kind
of
hotel
and
the
houses
of
officials
are
the
main
buildings
of
the
place
there
are
besides
a
sugar
refinery
a
hemp
and
silk
factory
and
a
brewery
mainly
supported
by
the
government
neither
of
the
first
two
were
flourishing
industries
and
one
of
the
factories
if
i
remember
aright
had
long
ceased
working
and
the
other
was
soon
to
follow
suit
the
government
i
must
say
have
done
their
best
to
encourage
and
push
on
industries
as
well
as
agriculture
in
this
district
but
their
efforts
have
produced
but
poor
results
machinery
which
had
been
imported
at
great
expense
from
england
america
germany
and
france
was
left
to
rust
and
perish
and
no
private
company
seemed
ready
to
continue
the
works
as
a
farming
region
the
sappro
district
has
also
proved
more
or
less
a
failure
from
a
financial
point
of
view
though
again
the
government
can
not
but
be
highly
praised
for
the
money
they
have
spent
in
trying
to
educate
the
people
up
to
some
kind
of
scientific
and
therefore
paying
method
of
agriculture
they
have
a
large
model
farm
of
about
acres
laid
down
in
grain
fields
as
well
as
in
meadows
and
pastures
stocked
with
cattle
imported
mainly
from
america
in
the
toyoshira
valley
south
of
the
town
a
cattle
farm
is
in
full
operation
but
it
yields
the
government
a
very
poor
return
however
the
government
i
believe
only
wish
to
teach
the
people
foreign
ways
of
agriculture
and
expect
no
direct
returns
for
the
pains
taken
and
the
money
sunk
so
at
least
it
would
appear
another
colonial
militia
settlement
is
also
found
near
baratte
eight
miles
north
of
sappro
regarding
these
settlements
it
may
prove
interesting
to
transcribe
the
imperial
ordinance
no
dated
august
by
which
they
were
brought
into
existence
and
the
tondens
were
built

sappro
was
a
civilised
place
compared
to
others
i
had
seen
in
yezo
but
it
had
neither
the
picturesqueness
nor
the
strangeness
nor
yet
the
interest
of
more
uncivilised
spots
there
is
no
doubt
that
savagery
when
you
have
got
accustomed
to
it
is
a
great
deal
more
fascinating
than
civilised
life
and
infinitely
more
so
than
a
base
imitation
of
civilisation
it
might
have
been
thought
that
after
the
months
of
privation
to
which
i
had
been
subjected
after
all
the
harassing
experiences
i
had
gone
through
after
the
accident
which
had
made
the
last
thirty
days
of
my
journey
so
agonising
i
should
have
been
glad
to
rest
in
this
london
of
the
ainu
country
at
least
until
i
was
well
again
but
in
truth
this
indirectly
reflected
civilisation
worried
me
the
bustle
of
the
people
the
lights
in
the
streets
the
sounds
of
the
everything
annoyed
me
his
excellency
the
governor
nagayama
kindly
called
on
me
and
when
i
put
on
some
decent
clothes
which
were
lent
me
he
drove
me
to
his
house
where
i
had
a
lengthy
conversation
on
the
future
of
yezo
and
the
kurile
islands
he
seemed
to
approve
of
many
of
the
points
which
i
put
before
him
among
which
i
suggested
that
the
exports
of
sulphur
from
kushiro
on
the
coast
would
be
greatly
increased
if
it
were
opened
to
foreign
trade
and
i
was
pleased
to
hear
several
months
later
that
a
motion
to
that
effect
was
proposed
in
the
japanese
parliament
he
also
agreed
with
me
that
yezo
needed
roads
and
railways
badly
and
that
when
more
facile
ways
of
communication
should
be
established
along
the
coast
and
across
country
then
without
doubt
yezo
would
be
rich
and
flourishing
he
expressed
sorrow
that
emigration
was
not
carried
on
on
a
larger
scale
from
the
southern
island
of
japan
and
that
private
companies
of
capitalists
in
no
way
helped
the
government
his
excellency
was
also
kind
enough
to
drive
me
round
the
town
and
show
me
all
the
sights
of
sappro
including
the
small
museum
containing
zoological
specimens
from
hokkaido
and
the
implements
of
the
ainu
and
the
a
huge
grizzly
bear
which
had
killed
two
babies
and
a
man
is
now
stuffed
and
occupies
the
first
small
room
while
a
bottle
by
the
side
preserves
in
spirit
the
head
and
foot
of
one
baby
and
some
parts
of
the
man
which
were
found
in
its
stomach
when
captured
and
dissected
i
left
sappro
for
otaru
by
the
coal
train
otaru
is
situated
on
a
semicircular
bay
which
makes
it
the
best
and
only
safe
port
on
the
western
coast
of
yezo
the
coast
at
the
mouth
of
the
ishikari
river
curves
gently
round
and
is
exposed
to
the
north
as
far
as
cape
shakotan
otaru
is
rapidly
growing
in
importance
owing
to
the
fact
that
it
is
the
nearest
shipping
port
to
the
poronai
coal
mines
unfortunately
three
small
hills
which
were
being
levelled
when
i
was
there
had
greatly
interfered
with
the
first
laying
out
of
the
settlement
which
accounts
for
the
town
being
all
crooked
and
irregularly
planned
it
has
the
appearance
of
a
thriving
place
and
much
resembles
one
of
the
small
seaports
of
southern
japan
in
the
main
street
a
tailor
had
written
over
his
door
the
following
inscription
for
the
attraction
of
foreign
clients
tailor
new
forms
of
every
country
shall
be
made
here
the
notice
was
tempting
and
i
went
in
to
request
his
services
in
furnishing
me
with
new
forms
as
he
called
them
of
english
fashion
but
to
my
great
regret
he
had
come
to
an
end
of
his
stock
of
goods
and
i
had
to
be
contented
with
my
old
forms
and
go
on
as
best
i
could
with
what
i
had
till
i
should
reach
hakodate
where
i
had
left
most
of
my
baggage
at
otaru
i
left
all
my
paraphernalia
to
be
shipped
to
hakodate
by
the
first
ship
calling
and
i
proceeded
by
land
on
the
north
and
then
on
the
coast
i
felt
that
suffering
as
i
still
was
i
should
keep
alive
as
long
as
i
kept
moving
as
long
as
i
was
distracted
by
new
scenery
and
new
excitements
i
felt
that
if
i
were
left
to
myself
not
pitied
or
sympathised
with
i
should
be
able
to
drag
on
and
conquer
in
the
end
there
is
nothing
it
seems
to
me
that
makes
people
feel
so
ill
or
is
so
enervating
as
the
sympathy
of
friends
and
the
verdict
of
a
doctor
among
civilised
people
nine
out
of
ten
do
not
know
whether
they
are
very
ill
or
not
until
the
doctor
pronounces
his
opinion
which
shows
that
many
complaints
would
be
scarcely
felt
at
all
if
the
patient
did
not
know
the
name
of
his
malady
or
if
he
had
sufficient
determination
as
to
prevent
his
physical
pain
from
becoming
a
moral
one
as
well
we
have
a
proof
of
this
in
hypnotism
by
which
sicknesses
of
many
kinds
can
be
cured
by
impressing
on
the
subject
the
belief
that
his
body
is
perfectly
free
from
disease
of
course
in
this
case
it
is
a
stronger
will
acting
on
a
weaker
one
which
so
reinforced
is
able
to
overpower
the
physical
trouble
again
i
may
be
allowed
to
state
that
savages
and
barbarians
though
affected
with
horrid
diseases
of
all
kinds
do
not
seem
to
suffer
from
them
as
much
as
we
do
if
an
ainu
man
breaks
his
leg
he
does
not
think
for
a
moment
of
lying
in
bed
for
the
regulation
forty
days
first
of
all
because
he
has
no
bed
to
lie
on
and
next
because
the
confinement
and
inaction
would
simply
kill
him
he
may
lie
down
on
the
hard
ground
for
two
or
three
days
after
which
time
he
crawls
about
as
best
he
can
until
nature
makes
his
broken
bone
right
again
he
does
not
worry
himself
much
about
it
wild
animals
do
the
same
if
then
the
ainu
and
with
them
savages
of
other
countries
do
that
why
should
not
i
a
human
being
like
them
do
the
same
freed
from
the
encumbrance
of
my
baggage
i
set
off
on
a
good
horse
down
the
north
coast
and
moving
from
east
to
west
my
baggage
now
consisted
of
a
crutch
which
i
had
made
for
myself
a
stick
a
couple
of
japanese
and
a
few
the
travelling
was
extremely
slow
and
i
shall
not
dwell
at
length
on
this
part
of
my
journey
for
it
has
no
interest
in
connection
with
the
ainu
as
i
met
with
scarcely
any
on
a
practicable
and
pleasant
track
leading
all
across
the
hills
beyond
oshoro
village
a
lovely
view
of
the
cliffs
between
that
place
and
yoichi
lying
to
the
west
is
to
be
had
in
some
parts
the
scenery
is
really
grand
coming
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
momonai
and
kawamura
two
fishermen
villages
of
some
importance
are
passed
and
further
west
through
a
picturesque
and
narrow
entrance
of
rugged
volcanic
rocks
is
yoichi
a
large
village
which
was
entirely
burnt
down
last
year
but
has
since
been
built
up
again
the
road
to
iwanai
branches
off
at
kawamura
across
the
shakotan
peninsula
this
peninsula
is
partly
volcanic
partly
composed
of
tertiaries
on
which
metal
veins
are
found
especially
along
the
course
of
the
yoichi
river
about
three
miles
from
yoichi
a
small
flax
factory
was
being
built
as
an
experiment
by
a
tokumatz
kuroda
in
the
employ
of
the
mitzui
company
miles
further
of
yoichi
is
iwanai
about
ten
miles
from
kawamura
at
hando
a
black
tumbledown
shed
like
a
haunted
house
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
woods
and
from
here
the
track
again
goes
over
a
mountain
on
the
other
side
is
iwanai
five
or
six
weeks
previous
to
my
arrival
a
large
fire
had
destroyed
nearly
the
whole
of
the
village
and
just
my
luck
again
i
had
great
difficulty
in
finding
a
place
in
which
to
obtain
shelter
for
the
night
from
iwanai
the
roughly
describes
a
semicircle
which
is
almost
concentric
with
volcano
bay
on
the
south
coast
the
distance
between
the
two
seas
being
about
twenty
or
miles
so
that
it
forms
a
kind
of
large
peninsula
stretching
towards
the
south
and
widening
considerably
at
its
most
southern
part
on
the
tsugaru
strait
the
first
two
or
three
miles
from
iwanai
were
a
pretty
flat
and
easy
track
but
then
i
struck
the
mountain
trail
which
was
steep
and
heavy
for
my
pony
it
was
raining
in
torrents
and
the
narrow
track
was
literally
turned
into
a
running
rivulet
by
good
luck
the
rain
stopped
and
when
i
reached
the
summit
i
had
a
glorious
panorama
of
the
brilliant
rocks
and
cliffs
of
the
shakotan
cape
to
the
with
the
kamui
and
the
hurupira
mountains
on
one
side
and
the
villages
of
shiribets
isoya
and
karibayama
along
the
coast
on
the
other
i
descended
into
the
valley
and
then
went
up
again
the
next
mountain
the
iwaonobori
a
higher
peak
than
the
first
i
went
down
its
slopes
on
the
other
side
in
a
fashion
and
then
came
to
the
river
called
shiribets
on
both
sides
of
which
a
few
fishermen
houses
are
found
forming
the
shiribets
village
three
miles
further
is
a
larger
settlement
isoya
the
half
of
which
is
called
notto
isoya
the
other
shimakotan
isoya
it
is
a
long
row
of
fishermen
houses
scattered
along
the
coast
until
we
get
to
ushoro
eight
miles
further
a
settlement
of
houses
ushoro
is
connected
by
a
road
to
oshamambe
on
volcano
bay
but
i
went
on
to
shitzo
four
miles
of
ushoro
the
way
was
fairly
good
in
some
parts
and
execrably
bad
in
others
the
heavy
rain
which
had
again
come
on
was
not
exactly
suited
to
my
present
state
of
health
moreover
it
swelled
all
the
small
brooks
which
fell
in
a
series
of
picturesque
waterfalls
over
the
high
cliffs
down
on
to
the
beach
as
the
beach
was
narrow
this
meant
each
time
a
cold
which
however
did
not
much
matter
for
i
was
already
drenched
by
the
rain
and
i
had
no
very
swell
garments
to
spoil
as
my
readers
know
illustration
ainu

of
volcano
bay
shitzo
is
an
place
but
there
is
nothing
attractive
about
it
it
is
in
a
small
bay
sheltered
by
cape
benke
but
its
anchorage
is
only
fit
for
junks
or
very
small
skiffs
it
is
much
exposed
to
northerly
and
easterly
winds
the
coast
from
shitzo
to
the
cape
is
lined
with
rocky
bluffs
and
cliffs
of
conglomerate
and
volcanic
formation
with
bare
hills
inland
there
are
many
reefs
stretching
out
both
along
the
coast
and
off
the
cape
but
in
many
places
channels
are
cut
in
them
to
all
appearance
produced
by
some
remote
volcanic
action
on
the
western
side
of
cape
benke
is
the
village
of
masatomari
there
were
formerly
some
ainu
villages
on
this
part
of
the
coast
but
hardly
any
natives
are
to
be
found
now
the
few
remaining
have
adopted
to
a
certain
extent
japanese
customs
and
manners
at
baraputa
i
heard
that
it
was
impossible
to
continue
my
journey
south
on
horseback
along
the
coast
for
the
track
was
almost
impassable
even
on
foot
it
was
a
steep
and
difficult
trail
over
the
mountains
among
rocks
and
precipitous
cliffs
and
i
was
quite
unable
to
accomplish
it
so
i
retraced
my
steps
to
shitzo
and
from
there
struck
across
the
peninsula
on
the
road
for
oshamambe
on
volcano
bay
the
road
is
a
good
one
and
when
bridges
are
built
where
needed
it
will
be
practicable
for
the
vehicles
of
southern
yezo
the
way
is
across
mountains
or
among
hills
kuromatsunai
is
the
largest
group
of
houses
found
along
the
road
it
is
about
halfway
between
the
two
coasts
late
at
night
after
having
ridden
miles
i
arrived
at
oshamambe
a
village
on

the
end
of
my
journey
oshamambe
is
a
group
of
seventy
houses
just
midway
between
mororran
and
mori
the
ainu
of
this
bay
are
poor
specimens
of
their
race
as
most
of
them
have
intermarried
with
japanese
they
are
however
those
most
talked
about
by
europeans
for
they
are
of
easy
access
to
they
are
mostly
and
even
second
and
third
crosses
wherefore
it
is
no
wonder
that
the
incautious
travellers
who
have
written
on
the
ainu
studying
only
these
specimens
have
discovered
in
them
a
remarkable
likeness
to
the
japanese
the
fact
that
i
was
rapidly
nearing
the
end
of
my
trip
half
filled
me
with
pleasure
yet
pleasure
mingled
with
regret
it
was
nearly
six
weeks
now
since
i
met
with
the
accident
to
my
foot
and
i
was
decidedly
better
the
cold
weather
had
greatly
contributed
to
this
improvement
of
my
condition
and
had
it
not
been
for
my
bone
which
kept
sticking
out
of
my
skin
i
should
have
considered
myself
in
fine
case
i
could
hop
along
with
my
crutch
and
my
stick
and
when
riding
the
pain
was
not
nearly
as
acute
as
it
had
been
the
first
fifteen
or
twenty
days
as
the
road
was
good
and
there
was
nothing
interesting
to
me
on
this
portion
of
the
journey
i
tried
to
push
on
rapidly
towards
mori
unfortunately
at
the
last
minute
my
patience
was
put
to
a
trial
i
hired
a
horse
and
it
was
lame
no
others
were
to
be
had
that
day
for
love
or
money
the
animal
had
been
lame
for
two
years
they
said
and
though
uncomfortable
to
ride
he
did
not
suffer
any
pain
this
i
ascertained
afterwards
was
true
for
that
day
the
sturdy
brute
carried
me
miles
without
once
requiring
punishment
it
is
needless
to
say
that
what
i
suffered
that
day
by
the
continuous
jerking
is
beyond
description
i
rode
fourteen
hours
in
a
fearful
storm
of
rain
and
snow
and
my
feverish
anxiety
to
reach
hakodate
soon
so
that
i
might
receive
letters
and
have
news
of
my
parents
and
friends
from
whom
i
had
not
heard
for
five
months
helped
me
to
pull
through
all
the
fatigue
and
worry
of
the
way
the
road
between
oshamambe
and
kunnui
is
fair
getting
still
better
towards
yurap
and
yamakushinai
but
to
shorten
the
journey
and
lessen
the
jerking
i
followed
the
sandy
which
describing
a
smaller
circle
than
the
road
necessarily
diminishes
the
distance
from
yamakushinai
the
road
is
very
good
and
wide
and
it
has
bridges
over
the
otoshibe
and
nigori
rivers
the
small
fishing
villages
though
not
so
imposing
in
appearance
as
some
of
those
in
other
parts
of
yezo
add
to
the
picturesqueness
of
the
bay
with
its
beautiful
volcanic
cone
of
komagatage
towering
in
the
distance
towards
the
the
fishing
in
volcano
bay
consists
mostly
of
mackerel
sprats
halibut
and
herrings
i
reached
mori
late
in
the
evening
and
was
received
with
a
friendly
greeting
by
the
people
of
the
in
which
i
had
stayed
on
my
way
up
at
the
beginning
of
my
journey
the
place
was
brilliantly
lighted
with
numberless
candles
and
opposite
the
entrance
was
a
kind
of
altar
decked
with
flowers
and
cakes
a
few
with
their
shaven
heads
and
long
thin
depraved
fingers
were
saying
their
prayers
and
beating
with
a
small
wand
on
the
round
wooden
bells
with
the
gods
of
japan
you
must
ring
a
bell
or
clap
your
hands
before
you
begin
to
pray
or
else
the
god
will
pay
no
attention
to
your
petitions
in
the
next
room
another
japanese
with
less
depraved
fingers
but
with
a
more
wicked
face
was
dressed
in
european
clothes
and
was
apparently
giving
a
sermon
and
sure
enough
he
proved
to
be
a
native
christian
minister
hallo
said
i
to
the
landlord
what
does
all
this
mean
oh
said
he
smiling
for
buddhism
teaches
you
not
to
show
pain
my
old
mother
is
dead
you
saw
her
when
you
were
here
before
she
died
yesterday
and
as
she
was
formerly
a
buddhist
and
had
become
a
christian
i
have
now
got
some
buddhist
and
a
christian
minister
to
pray
for
her
for
i
want
her
to
be
happy
in
the
other
world
but
do
you
not
think
i
replied
that
so
much
praying
of
different
kinds
might
interfere
with
her
happiness
oh
no
your
honourable
he
said
quickly
i
have
paid
the
and
the
clergyman
in
advance
and
the
gods
can
not
get
angry
now
it
was
curious
to
notice
the
competition
between
the
representatives
of
the
two
different
creeds
on
the
one
side
the
christian
shouted
his
prayers
and
sang
his
hymns
in
a
stentorian
voice
to
put
the
in
the
shade
and
get
the
start
of
them
in
the
contest
and
on
the
other
side
these
rattled
on
the
wooden
bells
with
all
their
might
so
that
their
prayers
should
be
heard
first
i
was
more
than
happy
when
this
religious
race
was
over
and
i
was
allowed
a
few
hours
rest
instead
of
going
straight
to
hakodate
by
by
the
road
i
had
already
once
traversed
i
followed
the
coast
in
a
direction
towards
the
volcano
of
esan
near
usushiri
some
two
miles
inland
are
the
hot
springs
of
obune
where
in
a
picturesque
gully
surrounded
by
mountains
are
two
dirty
shanties
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
wish
to
take
the
waters
at
isoya
five
miles
north
of
this
place
similar
springs
are
found
and
three
and
a
half
miles
of
usushiri
still
more
can
be
seen
at
kakumi
the
latter
place
is
a
picturesque
little
spot
with
its
three
old
sheds
and
the
steaming
framed
in
the
foliage
of
trees
with
their
lovely
autumn
tints
a
clean
path
a
few
hundred
yards
long
leads
from
the
coast
to
the
springs
and
a
track
across
the
mountains
is
found
between
that
place
and
hakodate
also
another
leading
from
obune
to
the
latter
port
by
both
these
tracks
a
most
lovely
view
of
hakodate
bay
can
be
obtained
when
the
summit
of
the
mountain
range
is
reached
from
kakumi
the
is
wretched
for
travelling
set
thick
as
it
is
with
stones
as
sharp
as
knives
while
the
waves
continually
wash
over
the
narrow
beach
drenching
the
wayfarer
to
the
skin
i
reached
otatsube
a
group
of
a
few
fishermen
huts
and
as
there
is
no
traffic
whatever
along
this
coast
there
were
no
regular
unfortunately
for
me
the
british
squadron
in
the
pacific
had
spent
the
summer
at
hakodate
and
the
ships
had
often
gone
for
somewhere
near
this
place
scaring
the
natives
to
death
and
furthermore
angering
them
against
foreigners
in
general
for
they
said
the
report
of
the
guns
frightened
away
all
the
fish
when
i
asked
for
food
and
offered
money
for
it
they
flatly
refused
me
saying
contemptuously
you
foreigners
come
and
scare
all
the
fish
away
and
now
you
shall
die
of
starvation
before
you
shall
get
food
from
us
we
do
not
want
your
money
we
are
rich
and
so
i
was
held
responsible
for
the
doings
of
her
majesty
fleet
which
until
then
i
did
not
even
know
had
been
in
those
waters
at
furimbé
the
next
small
village
only
a
few
miles
further
on
my
experience
was
even
more
unpleasant
not
only
would
they
not
give
me
food
but
they
would
not
shelter
me
for
the
night
in
any
of
the
houses
and
many
of
the
fishermen
taking
advantage
of
my
wretched
condition
were
impudent
to
such
a
point
that
i
thought
we
should
have
come
to
blows
it
was
getting
quite
dark
and
i
was
fearfully
hungry
and
exhausted
the
only
course
open
to
me
was
to
push
on
and
see
if
i
could
come
across
some
other
hut
where
the
owners
were
not
so
churlish
as
it
turned
out
for
the
first
time
since
i
had
been
in
hokkaido
i
had
some
good
luck
that
night
a
few
hundred
yards
from
this
japanese
village
among
the
trees
was
a
little
wooden
shrine
through
the
grating
of
the
door
i
caught
sight
of
offerings
of
cakes
and
rice
which
the
religious
fishermen
had
deposited
on
the
kind
of
altar
probably
to
appease
the
angry
gods
and
induce
them
to
fill
the
sea
with
fish
again
the
door
of
the
shrine
as
is
usual
in
country
places
in
japan
was
not
locked
but
a
small
outside
bolt
was
all
there
was
to
keep
it
closed
i
had
no
difficulty
in
entering
the
night
was
a
terrible
one
the
rain
was
pouring
in
torrents
and
having
had
nothing
to
eat
all
day
i
felt
i
had
not
the
strength
to
go
another
yard
after
all
i
said
to
myself
the
home
of
the
gods
japanese
or
not
is
good
enough
for
me
so
is
this
supper
i
soliloquized
swallowing
now
a
white
cake
now
a
red
one
then
a
green
one
till
nothing
but
the
empty
vessels
were
left
delicious
was
my
last
word
when
smacking
my
lips
over
the
last
green
cake
i
proceeded
to
make
myself
comfortable
for
the
night
it
is
needless
to
add
that
i
left
very
early
in
the
morning
when
the
first
rays
of
light
broke
the
dimness
of
the
night
and
i
dare
say
that
for
the
sake
of
morality
i
ought
to
add
that
i
was
sorry
for
committing
the
sacrilege
but
i
was
not
indeed
i
was
not
the
mountain
track
continued
rough
and
steep
in
many
places
and
the
autumn
tints
on
the
foliage
were
lovely
though
not
as
varied
as
those
of
northern
america
past
todohotke
another
volcano
the
esan
stared
me
in
the
face
its
crater
or
rather
its
craters
for
there
are
several
are
not
on
the
summit
of
the
mountain
which
is
well
rounded
but
nearly
halfway
down
its
western
slopes
accumulations
of
very
pure
sulphur
are
deposited
in
and
around
these
craters
and
a
continuous
rumbling
can
be
heard
inside
the
mountain
the
craters
eject
sulphurous
vapours
and
molten
lava
bubbles
up
as
if
in
gigantic
caldrons
congealing
at
the
mouths
of
the
craters
and
cracking
with
the
extreme
heat
the
is
precipitous
and
almost
impassable
round
cape
esan
therefore
the
track
leads
over
the
mountain
the
altitude
of
esan
is
feet
above
the
but
owing
to
its
rising
directly
from
the
sea
it
has
the
look
of
a
much
more
lofty
mountain
komagatage
near
mori
is
or
more
than
double
the
height
of
esan
while
makkarinupuri
volcano
or
shiribeshi
mountain
as
others
call
it
about
miles
of
sappro
and
ten
miles
north
of
toya
lake
reaches
an
altitude
of
feet
iwaonobori
which
i
passed
on
the
north
coast
in
this
latter
part
of
my
journey
is
feet
usu
on
volcano
bay
feet
tarumai
directly
south
of
sappro
only
reaches
a
height
of
feet
when
this
volcanic
part
of
the
coast
round
esan
cape
is
passed
the
track
becomes
easier
and
flatter
one
comes
again
to
the
sandy
beaches
and
the
coast
is
lively
with
numbers
of
fishermen
huts
and
a
couple
of
villages
like
shirikishinai
and
toi
one
day
journey
on
horseback
from
here
takes
you
to
hakodate
the
hakodate
peak
can
be
seen
in
the
distance
to
the
west
and
only
a
few
more
hours
only
a
few
more
miles
and
i
should
be
in
civilisation
i
should
see
a
few
european
faces
and
i
should
hear
english
spoken
again
as
i
approached
the
sandy
isthmus
and
the
peak
grew
bigger
before
me
i
wondered
what
had
been
going
on
in
the
world
and
what
news
i
should
receive
of
my
dear
ones
i
imagined
myself
already
devouring
with
my
eyes
the
hundreds
of
letters
which
must
have
been
amassed
at
hakodate
waiting
for
me
during
the
many
months
i
had
been
away
i
imagined
myself
half
buried
in
newspapers
months
old
anxiously
reading
the
news
of
the
world
i
hurried
on
my
pony
i
crossed
the
sand
isthmus
and
there
i
was
in
the
lively
streets
of
hakodate
gazed
at
by
the
astonished
japanese
who
i
believe
were
more
than
a
little
amazed
perhaps
scandalised
at
my
such
as
i
was
and
before
i
went
to
the
japanese
i
called
at
the
consulate
for
my
correspondence
her
britannic
representative
who
knew
me
well
enough
was
more
than
thunderstruck
when
i
appeared
before
him
in
such
a
strange
attire
he
was
smoking
a
pipe
and
he
almost
let
it
drop
such
was
his
surprise
who
are
you
he
feebly
exclaimed
looking
me
all
over
from
head
to
foot
surely
you
are
not
landor
he
said
when
i
told
him
my
name
i
believe
i
am
i
answered
and
i
have
come
to
trouble
you
for
my
letters
oh
none
have
come
we
have
none
he
said
drily
and
now
that
i
was
not
quite
so
well
dressed
as
when
i
had
called
on
my
arrival
at
hakodate
from
southern
japan
he
seemed
anxious
to
see
me
off
the
premises
as
soon
as
possible
i
dare
say
for
fear
lest
i
should
expire
on
his
doorstep
but
there
be
some
letters
i
said
as
i
was
sadly
leaving
no
there
are
none
he
repeated
the
first
glimpse
of
civilisation
and
of
a
civilised
being
was
certainly
not
a
pleasing
one
in
a
town
where
there
are
hardly
british
subjects
all
told
i
expected
a
better
reception
than
one
which
many
would
not
bestow
on
a
beggar
to
a
compatriot
in
a
foreign
country
kindness
costs
nothing
and
i
was
asking
no
favour
i
left
the
place
disheartened
but
feeling
that
the
pompous
official
had
made
a
blunder
unluckily
at
my
expense
henson
in
whose
house
i
had
left
all
my
luggage
greeted
me
with
open
arms
he
was
kindness
itself
and
very
different
from
the
gentleman
of
the
consulate
i
must
say
that
i
felt
most
uncomfortable
when
after
having
opened
my
trunks
i
put
on
fresh
clothes
and
boots
in
fact
such
was
the
change
from
my
late
airy
costume
that
i
caught
a
cold
i
had
now
almost
finished
my
task
i
had
made
the
whole
circuit
of
yezo
and
been
up
all
its
largest
rivers
with
the
exception
of
that
part
of
the
western
coast
which
lies
between
barabuta
and
hakodate
it
would
mean
only
a
few
more
days
of
agony
and
for
the
sake
of
completing
my
journey
i
left
hakodate
again
the
next
morning
at
in
a
for
esashi
on
the
west
coast
the
distance
is
miles
and
we
employed
sixteen
hours
in
covering
it
it
was
snowing
when
we
crossed
the
hills
and
it
was
fearfully
cold
fortunately
the
road
is
one
of
the
best
in
hokkaido
just
in
front
of
me
sat
a
poor
man
piteously
ill
with
his
body
was
dreadfully
swollen
and
his
limbs
were
stiff
what
the
poor
man
must
have
suffered
in
being
shaken
for
so
many
hours
is
beyond
description
his
lamentations
were
heartrending
he
had
come
to
hakodate
in
the
hope
of
getting
cured
and
now
he
was
returning
to
use
his
words
to
die
near
his
home
when
we
reached
esashi
he
was
truly
more
dead
than
alive
he
was
senseless
and
had
to
be
lifted
up
bodily
and
carried
into
the
house
esashi
is
a
large
place
and
is
one
of
the
oldest
towns
in
yezo
in
front
lies
a
small
oblong
island
with
which
various
wonderful
tales
of
treasure
are
connected
its
harbour
is
too
unsafe
being
exposed
to
all
winds
and
i
was
told
that
the
sea
is
always
rough
except
during
the
months
of
july
and
august
i
believe
that
this
is
greatly
due
to
the
currents
i
went
north
to
kumaishi
and
cape
ota
the
most
westerly
point
of
yezo
about
ten
miles
west
of
this
cape
is
the
small
island
of
okushiri
peopled
mostly
by
japanese
the
track
is
tolerably
fair
for
about
miles
as
far
as
kumaishi
it
runs
either
along
the
beach
or
around
clay
and
conglomerate
rocky
points
occasionally
over
the
cliffs
and
through
ravines
north
of
esashi
along
the
assap
river
is
a
good
stretch
of
cultivable
land
then
the
mountainous
region
begins
again
towards
the
north
kumaishi
is
said
to
be
the
best
district
for
herring
fishing
along
that
coast
from
kumaishi
to
kudo
numerous
reefs
extend
out
at
sea
and
small
headlands
afford
a
safe
anchorage
to
junks
the
track
is
mostly
on
a
rough
coast
backed
by
high
and
hills
striking
across
the
mountains
which
rise
sheer
from
the
sea
we
come
to
cape
ota
the
most
westerly
point
of
yezo
from
here
the
coast
turns
towards
the
as
far
as
barabuta
but
as
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
go
on
horseback
to
that
place
though
only
a
few
miles
distant
i
turned
back
and
returned
to
esashi
then
following
the
coast
towards
the
south
to
matsumai
or
fukuyama
one
of
the
first
japanese
settlements
established
in
yezo
and
formerly
the
capital
of
the
island
the
coast
is
rugged
and
picturesque
from
esashi
to
the
two
villages
of
kaminokumi
and
shiofuki
after
which
a
mountain
path
leads
to
ishisaki
i
found
the
japanese
on
this
coast
most
polite
and
honest
and
more
like
the
old
japanese
than
the
younger
generations
the
cliffs
on
the
south
side
of
the
ishizaki
river
were
resplendent
in
beauty
under
the
brilliant
red
and
yellow
light
of
the
setting
sun
oshima
or
large
island
could
be
seen
on
the
horizon
in
the
distant
south
five
miles
further
across
a
mountain
track
i
came
to
cisango
and
five
more
miles
beyond
that
place
landed
me
at
haraguchi
two
small
fishing
villages
with
houses
resting
on
high
posts
and
against
the
cliffs
somewhat
similar
to
the
villages
i
found
previous
to
my
reaching
the
ishikari
river
after
that
are
eight
or
ten
miles
of
a
monotonous
hilly
road
where
you
do
nothing
but
ascend
and
descend
one
small
hill
after
another
up
and
down
a
or
a
path
but
when
eramachi
is
passed
the
track
becomes
much
more
interesting
with
its
peculiar
groups
of
rocks
of
all
shapes
sticking
out
of
the
sea
and
the
long
line
of
reef
over
which
the
breakers
roll
foaming
and
thundering
from
here
by
the
side
of
oshima
another
small
island
koshima
is
seen
on
the
horizon
going
south
the
coast
gradually
gets
more
and
more
picturesque
with
its
pretty
little
fishing
villages
hidden
among
the
rocks
and
sheltered
under
the
high
cliffs
at
neptka
a
good
road
leads
over
the
cliffs
to
fukuyama
about
a
mile
before
the
town
is
reached
from
a
high
point
of
vantage
on
the
road
is
a
pretty
peep
of
benten
island
just
off
the
shore
with
an
old
temple
on
it
and
by
its
side
a
new
lighthouse
on
the
shore
a
few
yards
from
the
road
opposite
the
island
a
large
rock
is
literally
covered
with
hundreds
of
stone
images
of
amida
and
different
gods
and
two
sacred
emblems
of
japan
are
placed
in
front
of
it
i
descended
the
slope
gently
and
reached
koromatsumai
otherwise
called
matsumai
or
fukuyama
it
is
a
dear
old
spot
the
most
picturesque
of
all
the
towns
in
hokkaido
it
is
ancient
for
one
thing
while
other
places
are
modern
some
villages
indeed
only
a
year
or
two
old
or
even
less
thus
weather
has
toned
down
the
light
yellow
colour
of
the
new
wood
which
is
so
offensive
to
the
eye
in
a
landscape
and
is
so
common
in
all
japanese
villages
of
yezo
besides
fukuyama
has
pretty
temples
on
the
surrounding
hills
and
gardens
with
tiny
stone
bridges
bronze
lanterns
and
dwarfed
trees
it
is
more
like
a
town
of
old
japan
it
has
a
castle
with
roofs
as
one
sees
on
the
plates
the
castle
formerly
the
residence
of
the
daimio
a
feudal
prince
is
now
a
restaurant
the
irregular
streets
of
the
town
the
narrow
lanes
the
houses
blackened
by
smoke
and
age
give
a
certain
which
is
peculiar
to
the
place
itself
the
inhabitants
too
are
more
conservative
than
the
younger
colonists
and
are
quite
in
keeping
with
the
place
unluckily
the
town
has
seen
better
days
it
possesses
no
good
harbour
and
all
its
trade
little
by
little
is
being
carried
away
by
its
more
fortunate
rival
hakodate
the
population
of
matsumai
decreases
considerably
every
year
as
the
inhabitants
leave
this
poetical
but
and
decaying
spot
for
the
more
exciting
life
to
be
found
in
districts
further
east
or
north
between
fukuyama
and
hakodate
a
distance
of
over
sixty
miles
the
road
is
extremely
bad
and
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
see
shirakami
cape
is
interesting
as
being
the
most
southern
point
of
yezo
and
from
here
the
coast
turns
slightly
towards
the
fukushima
is
an
old
village
the
other
headlands
and
the
cape
of
yagoshi
have
no
special
features
calling
for
attention
near
the
latter
cape
the
coast
is
volcanic
which
renders
it
very
rugged
in
shape
and
warmly
tinted
in
colour
there
are
many
villages
along
the
coast
as
yoshioka
shiriuchi
kikonai
idzumizawa
mohechi
and
kamiiro
and
the
inhabitants
seem
well
off
and
people
a
great
quantity
of
coal
and
firewood
is
carried
on
from
these
mountains
to
hakodate
rows
of
ten
twelve
or
fifteen
ponies
one
after
the
other
loaded
with
as
much
as
they
can
carry
can
be
seen
slowly
travelling
under
the
care
of
one
man
down
to
the
principal
port
of
yezo
especially
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
season
and
here
and
there
stacks
of
split
wood
are
piled
ready
for
transportation
rounding
the
hakodate
bay
i
was
again
at
the
point
whence
i
had
first
started
and
happy
that
notwithstanding
all
the
i
had
had
notwithstanding
the
strain
on
my
physique
which
is
not
by
any
means
herculean
and
notwithstanding
all
the
obstacles
which
had
come
in
my
way
i
had
finally
succeeded
in
doing
what
no
european
had
ever
done
before
namely
in
completing
the
whole
circuit
of
yezo
at
one
time
exploring
all
its
most
important
rivers
and
lakes
studying
the
habits
customs
and
manners
of
that
strange
race
of
people
the
hairy
ainu
and
visiting
the
kuriles
besides
many
parts
which
i
travelled
over
had
never
been
trodden
by
european
foot
and
this
made
my
journey
all
the
more
interesting
to
me
as
the
book
stands
i
have
related
but
the
principal
adventures
which
i
had
during
my
long
peregrinations
in
hokkaido
most
of
which
are
intended
to
illustrate
ainu
customs
and
traits
by
my
own
personal
experience
rather
than
to
excite
sympathy
for
my
hardships
really
though
the
journey
nearly
cost
me
my
life
i
have
never
in
my
extensive
wanderings
enjoyed
a
trip
more
than
that
to
ainuland
i
have
touched
but
slightly
and
not
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
on
subjects
relating
to
the
japanese
for
this
is
intended
as
a
work
on
the
ainu
i
was
happy
yet
sorry
to
be
at
the
end
of
my
journey
this
was
the
day
since
i
first
left
hakodate
and
the
distance
i
had
travelled
was
about
miles
out
of
which
were
ridden
on
horseback
or
an
average
of
miles
a
day
the
remaining
miles
were
either
by
steamer
or
canoe
travelling
from
the
day
i
broke
the
bone
in
my
foot
i
travelled
days
mostly
on
horseback
and
the
first
time
it
was
attended
to
and
properly
bandaged
up
was
sixty
days
after
it
occurred
or
two
days
after
my
arrival
in
hakodate
by
pooley
chief
engineer
on
board
the
ss
henson
was
again
extremely
kind
and
pressed
me
to
leave
the
and
go
and
stay
at
his
place
and
after
five
months
of
hard
planks
i
slept
again
in
a
comfortable
bed
what
a
treat
it
was
what
a
curious
sensation
to
sleep
in
a
bed
again
and
actually
have
sheets
and
blankets
but
this
was
not
all
for
surprise
followed
surprise
the
pompous
consul
who
for
the
sake
of
saving
himself
the
trouble
of
looking
into
his
desk
had
made
my
last
portion
of
the
journey
wretched
and
sorrowful
found
that
after
all
he
was
mistaken
and
on
the
in
my
place
i
found
a
packet
of
about
letters
and
newspapers
which
the
consul
sent
to
me
with
a
message
saying
that
when
i
called
last
time
he
had
forgotten
who
i
was
and
therefore
had
forgotten
to
give
me
my
correspondence
now
that
we
have
travelled
round
and
through
the
country
in
every
direction
now
that
we
have
seen
where
the
different
tribes
of
ainu
are
i
shall
attempt
to
give
my
readers
some
insight
into
the
ainu
themselves
and
their
mode

ainu
habitations
storehouses
trophies
furniture
conservatism
ainu
architecture
is
by
no
means
elaborate
let
alone
beautiful
but
though
it
is
so
simple
it
is
to
a
certain
extent
varied
differing
according
to
the
exigencies
of
climate
and
locality
huts
of
one
district
vary
from
those
of
another
not
only
in
small
details
but
also
in
the
whole
shape
or
if
the
shape
is
the
same
the
materials
are
different
the
principal
characteristics
of
the
volcano
bay
and
saru
river
huts
is
that
they
have
angular
roofs
and
are
thatched
with
tall
reeds
and
arundinaria
while
the
huts
up
the
tokachi
river
are
more
often
covered
with
bark
though
in
form
they
are
almost
identical
with
those
others
on
the
kutcharo
lake
again
the
huts
are
thatched
with
tall
reeds
like
those
of
volcano
bay
but
the
building
itself
has
a
totally
different
shape
the
roof
is
semicircular
and
each
hut
is
in
appearance
like
the
half
of
a
cylinder
lying
on
its
rectangular
base
on
the
coast
the
huts
have
either
roofs
similar
to
the
kutcharo
ones
or
else
the
angle
is
very
obtuse
instead
of
being
sharp
as
with
the
piratori
or
volcano
bay
huts
in
the
kuriles
at
shikotan
the
ainu
have
houses
exactly
similar
to
those
at
piratori
setting
aside
the
varieties
of
form
we
shall
now
consider
how
the
huts
are
built
a
frame
is
first
made
by
horizontally
lashing
at
short
intervals
long
poles
to
others
at
the
angles
of
the
roof
often
the
roof
is
made
first
and
lifted
up
bodily
on
the
forked
poles
on
which
it
rests
then
long
reeds
and
arundinaria
are
collected
in
sufficient
quantity
to
thatch
the
frame
thickly
on
each
side
other
poles
or
rafters
are
then
placed
over
these
reeds
and
through
them
lashed
tightly
to
the
under
frame
thus
preventing
the
thatch
from
being
blown
or
washed
away
care
is
taken
to
leave
an
opening
for
the
door
and
the
small
east
window
usually
the
only
one
in
ainu
huts
is
cut
out
afterwards
by
means
of
a
knife
ainu
huts
have
never
more
than
one
storey
and
never
more
than
one
room
and
a
small
porch
in
districts
where
the
climate
is
less
severe
the
porch
is
often
dispensed
with
in
building
their
habitations
the
hairy
people
make
no
attempt
whatever
at
symmetry
or
beauty
all
they
aim
at
is
to
make
themselves
a
shelter
and
nothing
more
there
are
no
more
professional
architects
than
professionals
of
any
other
kind
in
the
ainu
country
each
man
is
his
own
architect
builder
and
carpenter
he
may
occasionally
receive
the
help
of
a
neighbour
when
he
is
building
his
hut
if
all
hands
in
the
family
are
not
sufficient
to
carry
him
through
his
work
each
family
has
its
own
hut
which
is
used
day
and
night
by
all
the
members
if
one
of
the
sons
gets
married
he
sometimes
brings
his
bride
to
live
in
his
father
hut
or
else
he
goes
to
live
in
his
bride
hut
but
as
the
hairy
is
no
better
than
other
the
end
of
this
arrangement
is
that
generally
the
bridegroom
has
to
build
a
habitation
for
himself
and
his
fortunately
for
him
he
has
to
pay
no
nor
has
he
to
take
a
lease
nor
pay
the
lawyer
for
an
agreement
nor
yet
to
buy
the
ground
nor
the
materials
on
which
and
of
which
his
not
too
luxurious
abode
is
to
be
built
he
chooses
the
site
which
is
most
suitable
to
him
and
there
he
builds
his
hut
as
best
he
can
and
no
one
is
any
the
worse
or
the
wiser
for
it
the
furnishing
is
a
matter
of
no
consideration
with
the
ainu
as
he
prefers
to
live
in
an
unfurnished
house
by
instalments
however
as
he
finds
his
floor
becoming
rather
damp
he
provides
himself
with
a
few
rough
planks
which
afford
him
comfortable
sleeping
accommodation
and
during
the
winter
when
fishing
is
not
practicable
and
he
spends
most
of
his
day
at
home
he
roughly
carves
for
himself
a
the
a
small
paddle
the
which
is
used
both
to
stir
the
wine
and
as
an
implement
in
weaving
a
pestle
and
mortar
carved
out
of
the
trunk
of
a
tree
and
if
he
be
a
very
ambitious
person
and
fond
of
his
wife
he
will
probably
make
her
a
weaving
loom
as
well
as
two
or
three
if
we
may
call
them
so
vessels
made
of
bark
bent
into

and
lashed
so
strongly
as
to
be

for
carrying

needed
a
few
wooden

a
wooden
hook
which
is
suspended
over
the
fire
when
is
smoked
occasionally
a
a
mat
and
a
skin
or
two
are
all
the
articles
of
furniture
of
ainu
manufacture
which
an
ainu
can
possess
though
few
of
them
possess
so
many
the
ainu
hut
has
a
in
the
centre
or
rather
a
fire
is
lighted
in
the
centre
of
the

the
fire
is
lighted
with
a
flint
and
steel
a
method
learned
from
the
japanese
or
by
the
friction
of
two
sticks
the
more
civilised
ainu
have
now
adopted
matches
a
hole
in
the
angle
of
the
roof
acts
as
chimney
but
unfortunately
more
in
name
than
in
practice
chairs
stools
sofas
beds
tables
are
all
things
unknown
to
the
ainu
while
inspecting
the
hut
it
may
be
as
well
to
see
how
the
the
most
complicated
article
of
the
ainu
household
is
made
and
worked
there
is
a
yarn
beam
the
on
which
the
warp
of
unwoven
thread
is
wound
and
kept
separated
and
another
roll
by
which
the
warp
threads
in
the
process
of
weaving
are
kept
in
tension
between
the
two
gratings
there
then
is
the
the
large
grating
through
the
intervals
of
which
the
warp
threads
pass
and
the
a
similar
but
smaller
grating
placed
on
the
other
side
of
the
roll

sticks
the
cloth
is
wound
round
a
stick
which
rests
on
the
lap
of
the
weaver
and
is
kept
in
tension
by
means
of
her
wrists
and
at
the
same
time
the
the
shuttle
is
passed
between
the
two
sets
of
warp
threads
carrying
the
transverse
thread
or
woof
from
one
side
of
the
cloth
to
the
other
and
back
again
this
is
then
beaten
up
by
means
of
a
long
shuttle
like
a
netting
mesh
which
first
draws
the
weft
into
its
place
and
is
then
used
to
beat
it
up
in
some
ways
this
form
of
loom
is
similar
to
that
of
india
the
netting
mesh
is
called
finally
the
is
a
instrument
for
separating
the
threads
illustration
the
ahunkanitte
illustration
the
pekoatnit
it
is
needless
to
say
that
with
this
primitive
and
homemade
loom
it
takes
a
very
long
time
to
weave
a
very
short
piece
of
cloth
but
as
time
is
not
money
with
ainu
women
and
patience
is
one
of
their
virtues
it
answers
their
purpose
and
they
wish
for
nothing
better
illustration
in
process
of
weaving
the
thread
used
for
manufacturing
the
cloth
is
made
of
the
inner
fibre
of
the
bark
at
the
beginning
of
the
spring
the
elm
bark
is
peeled
off
the
trees
and
is
put
in
water
to
soak
and
soften
until
the
inner
fibres
can
be
separated
made
into
threads
and
wound
up
round
reeds
the
material
woven
from
these
threads
is
very
coarse
and
brittle
except
in
wet
weather
or
when
soaked
in
water
in
which
case
clothes
made
of
it
can
not
be
worn
out
the
weaving
is
usually
plain
but
sometimes
a
simple
pattern
of
black
parallel
lines
is
woven
in
with
the
material
the
natural
colour
of
the
thread
is
dark
yellow
and
the
black
lines
are
composed
of
the
same
thread
stained
the
other
contrivance
in
ainu
huts
which
strikes
one
as
being
simple
but
clever
is
the
hook
suspended
over
the
fire
the
rope
is
passed
over
a
rafter
one
end
of
it
is
fastened
to
the
hook
the
other
as
shown
in
the
illustration
to
a
piece
of
wood
through
which
the
hook
has
previously
been
passed
illustration
roasting
hook
is
closely
allied
to
weaving
and
is
worked
entirely
on
the
same
principle
but
without
the
aid
of
any
kind
of
machinery
the
bulrushes
are
crossed
and
woven
coarsely
and
plaited
flat
one
of
these
mats
is
used
in
ainu
huts
as
a
door
the
a
smaller
one
is
hung
over
or
by
the
window
naturally
ainu
huts
are
somewhat
draughty
the
imperfectness
of
the
door
and
the
large
outlet
for
the
smoke
besides
the
wind
which
finds
its
way
through
the
thatched
walls
make
ainu
dwellings
ideal
to
anyone
wishing
to
catch
his
death
of
cold
the
ainu
do
not
much
mind
it
the
roof
is
low
and
from
it
hang
the
winter
provisions
of
dried
salmon
captured
during
the
autumn
this
gives
an
additional
odour
to
the
already
strong
scent
of
the
hut
an
ancient
smell
not
redolent
of
the
perfumes
of
arabia
the
smoke
inside
the
hut
is
so
dense
when
there
happens
to
be
a
fire
burning
that
one
eyes
stream
with
involuntary
tears
and
one
is
nearly
choked
when
the
days
are
short
in
winter
the
ainu
sometimes
light
their
dwellings
with
a
stick
to
which
is
fastened
a
piece
of
animal
fat
it
is
hung
up
aloft
and
when
the
lower
end
is
lighted
the
fat
slowly
melting
serves
to
feed
the
flame
and
keep
this
primitive
lamp
alight
another
mode
of
illumination
is
by
firing
a
lighted
piece
of
birch
bark
on
a
stick
previously
split
at
the
upper
end
the
third
way
is
by
filling
a
large
shell
with
and
burning
in
it
a
few
strings
of
none
of
these
methods
come
much
into
use
for
everyday
life
as
unlike
the
negroes
the
ainu
are
not
fond
of
sitting
up
at
night
except
on
extraordinary
occasions
and
when
by
chance
they
do
sit
up
it
is
by
the
light
of
the
fire
only
if
a
stranger
stops
for
the
night
in
an
ainu
hut
he
is
made
to
sleep
directly
under
the
east
window
but
the
family
take
good
care
to
sleep
all
together
on
the
north
side
which
is
the
most
distant
point
from
the
door
and
the
window
occasional
callers
are
received
on
the
side
nearest
to
the
door
the
few
ainu
who
possess
mats
on
which
they
sit
during
the
day
hang
them
up
at
night
round
the
hut
probably
to
protect
themselves
from
the
liberal
ventilation
which
even
those
who
are
used
to
it
find
trying
when
a
gale
is
blowing
or
the
thermometer
is
very
low
there
is
no
particular
spot
inside
the
hut
set
apart
for
meals
and
the
refuse
is
either
thrown
into
a
corner
of
the
hut
or
flung
outside
the
door
and
left
there
it
is
difficult
to
say
whether
the
inside
or
the
outside
of
an
ainu
hut
is
the
dirtier
heaps
of
stinking
refuse
are
accumulated
round
the
dwellings
and
in
these
heaps
are
alive
with
vermin
mosquitoes
flies
and
it
is
quite
sufficient
to
move
a
step
from
the
door
to
see
a
cloud
of
these
noxious
insects
rise
and
each
one
of
them
will
have
a
bite
at
you
inside
the
house
you
are
no
better
off
fleas
are
innumerable
and
of
all
sizes
not
to
mention
other
but
usually
anonymous
enemies
of
the
human
skin
the
first
night
i
slept
in
an
ainu
hut
though
i
was
provided
with
insecticide
powder
i
was
literally
covered
with
bites
with
my
fondness
for
statistics
i
proceeded
to
count
them
and
only
from
my
ankle
to
my
knee
i
counted
as
many
as
the
rest
of
my
body
and
my
head
were
covered
in
the
same
proportion
but
i
gave
up
the
attempt
to
ascertain
the
exact
number
the
task
was
too
overwhelming
my
skin
however
got
so
inflamed
by
these
bites
as
to
produce
fever
which
lasted
two
or
three
days
after
that
time
i
never
again
suffered
to
such
an
extent
perhaps
owing
to
the
fact
that
no
free
spot
was
left
to
attack
or
may
be
from
that
curious
process
called
acclimatisation
the
ainu
huts
are
built
entirely
above
ground
and
are
used
alike
in
winter
and
summer
in
olden
times
the
hut
was
always
destroyed
at
the
death
of
its
owner
or
when
abandoned
but
in
the
former
case
the
custom
is
seldom
practised
now
and
in
the
latter
they
are
merely
left
to
decay
it
is
singular
that
migrating
ainu
coming
across
an
uninhabited
hut
never
live
in
it
but
build
a
new
one
for
themselves
the
kurilsky
ainu
until
quite
recently
destroyed
their
huts
when
migrating
from
one
island
to
another
they
also
burnt
the
huts
of
deceased
persons
it
is
needless
to
say
that
the
ainu
have
no
churches
no
hotels
no
hospitals
and
no
public
buildings
of
any
kind
the
huts
in
villages
are
a
little
way
from
one
another
and
each
hut
has
directly
in
front
a
separate
storehouse
built
on
piles
or
posts
so
as
not
to
be
accessible
to
wolves
dogs
or
rats
these
are
small
structures
the
architecture
of
which
has
the
local
characteristics
of
the
habitations
with
the
exception
that
they
are
invariably
on
piles
while
the
habitations
are
on
the
ground
clothes
furs
mats
and
winter
provisions
of
are
kept
in
these
storehouses
and
access
to
them
is
by
means
of
a
peculiar
ladder
it
is
a
mere
log
of
wood
six
or
seven
feet
in
length
pointed
at
one
end
and
with
five
or
six
incisions
which
serve
as
steps
and
remind
me
of
the
steps
cut
by
an
in
a
glacier
or
on
frozen
snow
natives
go
up
and
down
these
ladders
with
ease
even
when
carrying
heavy
weights
on
their
heads
and
good
care
is
always
taken
to
remove
the
ladder
when
leaving
the
storehouse
women
principally
look
after
these
storehouses
and
seem
to
have
the
whole
care
and
control
of
them
i
have
often
seen
an
ainu
girl
for
a
storehouse
could
hardly
hold
more
than
one
sitting
on
the
tiny
door
working
at
her
lord
and
master
robe
hour
after
hour
i
have
seen
her
sitting
there
working
patiently
till
the
sun
has
set
and
the
darkness
has
come
her
materials
were
then
stowed
away
the
mat
at
the
door
was
let
down
the
ladder
descended
and
kicked
away
and
sadly
singing
in
her
soft
falsetto
voice
she
retired
into
the
dirt
and
dark
of
her
habitation
the
storehouses
stand
about
six
feet
above
the
level
of
the
ground
and
are
generally
on
four
six
or
eight
piles
upon
each
pile
is
placed
a
large
square
piece
of
wood
turned
downwards
at
the
sides
so
as
not
to
be
accessible
to
rats
and
mice
upon
these
square
pieces
of
wood
rest
horizontally
four
rafters
forming
a
quadrangle
about
eight
feet
square
the
small
storehouse
has
as
a
base
this
quadrangle
and
is
seldom
high
enough
to
allow
of
an
adult
to
stand
inside
storehouses
are
thatched
like
all
other
houses
on
the
upper
tokachi
however
they
are
covered
with
the
bark
of
trees
next
in
connection
with
ainu
habitations
comes
the
at
the
east
end
of
the
hut
this
is
on
a
parallel
line
to
the
hut
wall
and
only
a
few
yards
away
from
it
and
is
made
of
a
number
of
poles
upon
which
are
placed
the
skulls
of
the
bears
wolves
and
foxes
killed
by
the
owner
of
the
hut
the
ainu
is
proud
of
this
trophy
and
if
the
number
of
bear
skulls
is
very
large
he
commands
a
certain
amount
of
respect
from
his
hairy
brethren
there
is
nothing
that
ainu
admire
more
than
courage
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
that
an
ainu
desires
more
than
to
be
thought
brave
when
he
has
gained
this
character
a
man
becomes
in
a
certain
way
the
lion
of
the
village
he
embellishes
his
trophy
with
a
and
willow
wands
with
overhanging
shavings
chapter
on
superstitions
and
he
always
looks
on
it
as
an
evidence
of
his
manly
glory
besides
this
many
ainu
possess
one
or
two
live
bears
kept
in
cages
bear
hunters
often
secure
one
or
more
cubs
which
they
bring
home
and
allow
to
live
in
the
hut
like
one
of
the
family
or
an
irishman
pig
these
cubs
are
nursed
along
with
and
in
the
same
manner
as
the
children
and
ainu
say
that
women
often
put
them
to
the
breast
and
suckle
them
like
their
own
infants
whether
this
is
true
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
though
i
have
never
seen
it
and
therefore
can
not
vouch
for
it
it
is
not
unlike
ainu
women
to
do
such
a
thing
when
the
grow
big
and
powerful
enough
to
be
dangerous
the
men
make
a
rough
cage
with
logs
of
timber
placing
them
one
over
the
other
in
a
quadrangular
shape
and
lashing
them
strongly
together
the
bear
is
driven
into
the
cage
which
is
then
roofed
over
and
after
a
couple
of
years
of
confinement
during
which
it
is
fattened
poor
bruin
is
killed
for
a
bear
festival
in
the
lower
part
of
the
cage

is
a
small
wooden
tray

which
food
is
served
to
the
captive
illustration
the
or
as
used
by
piratori
ainu
on
the
coast
of
yezo
i
have
also
seen
smaller
cages
in
which
foxes
eagles
or
other
animals
are
kept
and
i
always
noticed
the
care
which
ainu
took
to
feed
up
the
imprisoned
animals
that
charity
begins
at
home
is
true
even
among
the
hairy
people
for
if
they
are
kind
to
animals
it
is
only
for
the
sake
of
making
a
good
meal
of
them
on
the
first
occasion
that
presents
itself
it
may
be
as
well
to
state
that
the
ainu
have
never
been
known
to
make
pottery
what
they
have
of
the
kind
is
imported
and
sold
to
or
exchanged
with
them
by
the
japanese
if
i
were
an
irishman
i
should
say
that
real
ainu
pottery
is
made
of
wood
nevertheless
large
shells
are
often
used
by
them
as
drinking
vessels
where
wooden
bowls
are
not
obtainable
it
is
a
common
occurrence
in
ainu
households
that
one
bowl
is
used
by
several
individuals
and
a
more
common
occurrence
still
that
none
of
the
bowls
are
ever
washed
or
cleaned
after
having
been
used

live

on

some

of

which
they
find
on
the
mountains
metallurgy
is
utterly
unknown
to
the
ainu
until
of
late
years
they
possessed
nothing
made
of
metal
their
arrows
had
bamboo
or
bone
heads
tin
or
iron
cooking
utensils
they
had
none
and
the
blades
of
their
knives
were
and
are
of
japanese
origin
some
of
these
blades
are
very
old
and
were
acquired
by
the
ainu
in
the
battles
which
they
fought

the

this
too
as
we
have
seen
is
but
a
very
rude
and
simple
kind
of
machine
the
application
of
wind
or
water
power
to
economise
human
labour
is
in
no
way
known
to
them
thus
they
have
no
windlasses
no
pumps
no
bellows
no
windmills
no
waterwheels
neither
have
they
any
signs
of
the
rudest
form
of
machinery
moved
by
manual
power
which
they
have
imagined
and
made
for
themselves
furthermore
they
are
very
loth
to
accept
those
mechanical
means
of
economising

which
are
employed
by
their

the

the

are
very
conservative
little
as
they
may
have

they
show
a
great
dislike
to
change
or
reform
their
habits
and
customs
or
to
improve
themselves
in
any
way
worse
they
could
certainly
not
be
they
have
no
ancestral
attachment
which
makes
them
unwilling
to
discard
their
rude
practices
for
more
civilised
ways
but
acting
according
to
their
instincts
and
not
by
their
intelligence
they
preserve
customs
which
seem
inconvenient
and
unpractical
to
us
which
habit
has
rendered
familiar
and
pleasant
to
them
various
natives
in
other
parts
of
the
world
show
signs
of
an
earlier
state
of
civilisation
but
the
ainu
do
not
they
have
never
had
a
past
civilisation
they
are
not
civilised
now
and
what
is
more
they
will
never
be
civilised
civilisation
kills
them
as
a
hog
delights
in
filth
so
the
ainu
can
only
live
in
dirt
neglect
and
savagery
of
personal
habits
they
are
made
that
way
and
they
can
not
help
it
they
are
excluded
from

an
impassable
barrier
they
have
many
miseries
in

no
greater
misery
could
befall
an
ainu
than
to
be
forced
to
lead

existence
even
after
they
have
been
educated
in

schools
when
they
return

unknown
to

any

and

to
mouth
is
all
they
have
by
way
of

continuity
the
nearest
approach
made
to
graphic

is
in
the
owner
marks
which
we
occasionally
find
on
some
of
their
implements
the
is
the
article
on
which
this
mark
is
most
commonly
found
what
these
marks
are
meant
to
represent
i
do
not
know
for
certain
but
i
believe
that
fig
is
supposed
to
convey
the
idea
of
a
house
and
fig
that
of
a
boat
fig
a
bear
cage
and
the
mere
result
of
fancy
even
these
marks
are
only
rarely
found
and
have
probably
been
suggested
by
japanese
writing
the
illustration
shows
the
four
specimens
which
i
found
carved
on
illustration
closely
allied
with
writing
is
of
course
and
ornamentations
map
drawing
can
be
dismissed
at
once
like
that
famous
chapter
on
snakes
in
iceland
as
the
ainu
know
nothing
of
it
rough
ornamentations
on
bone
and
wooden
implements
are
their
only
artistic
efforts
truthful
representations
of
figures
and
animals
are
seldom
attempted
but
conventionalised
symbols
suggested
by
and
based
on
certain
forms
of
animal
or
vegetable
life
are
occasionally
used
for
ornamentation
the
only
attempt
at
animal
representation
is
the
small
in
chiefs
crowns
the
ainu
have
no
and
can
neither
paint
nor
draw
in
any
form
what
they
have
are
mere
simple
but
only
a
few
have
any
aptitude
for
even
this
crude
work
though
of
course
they
are
not
all
alike
as
with
us
we
have
people
who
are
artistic
and
people
who
are
philistine
so
with
the
ainu
in
that
very
humble
degree
which
is
to
western
art
what
an
acorn
is
to
an
oak
like
all
early
work
ainu
art
if
we
may
call
it
so
aims
at
a
certain
uniformity
especially
in
so
as
to
produce
a
somewhat
symmetrical
pattern
for
at
all
times
geometry
has
been
the
mother
of
design
an
ainu
does
not
go
for
his
models
direct
to
nature
neither
does
he
servilely
copy
his
neighbour
work
but
he
gets
his
ideas
indirectly
from
both
these
sources
and
through
inability
to
copy
accurately
negligence
in
close
study
and
some
amount
of
native
imagination
combined
varies
the
design
which
he
has
seen
to
such
an
extent
as
to
make
it
in
a
sense
original
the
talent
shown
by
different
men
in
the
art
of
carving
varies
considerably
even
in
men
of
the
same
tribe
while
certain
tribes
show
both
aptitude
and
fondness
for
these
ornamentations
whereas
others
have
little
of
either
it
is
the
ainu
of
the
upper
ishikari
river
who
chiefly
excel
in
these
carved
ornamentations
the
knife
represented
in
the
illustration
comes
from
kamikawa
and
was
carved
with
the
point
of
a
knife
by
the
chief
of
the
ainu
there
it
took
the
man
many
months
to
accomplish
and
it
is
by
far
the
best
specimen
of
ainu
workmanship
that
i
saw
in
yezo
though
the
ornamentations
on
it
are
not
purely
ainu
in
character
this
man
was
a
genius
as
compared
to
other
ainu
and
his
ideas
of
form
and
precision
were
considerably
more
developed
than
in
most
of
his
race
he
has
ornamented
the
sheath
with
conventionalised
symbols
which
were
apparently
suggested
to
him
by
leaves
and
branches
of
trees
and
the
suggestion
of
a
flower
can
be
noticed
in
the
upper
part
of
the
handle
a
suggestion
of
has
been
used
by
him
to
fill
up
small
open
spaces
others
he
filled
up
with
parallel
lines
the
sheath
is
made
of
two
parts
to
allow
the
carver
to
cut
the
space
for
the
blade
inside
but
these
two
parts
are
well
fitted
together
and
kept
fast
by
six
rings
of
bark
fastened
on
while
fresh
so
that
by
shrinking
the
two
sides
of
the
sheath
are
brought
close
together
and
are
as
if
made
of
one
single
piece
the
side
view
of
the
same
knife
shows
the
clever
contrivance
for
fastening
it
on
to
the
girdle
without
removing
the
latter
from
around
the
body
this
knife
may
be
ranked
among
the
of
ainu
art
illustration
side
view
the
principal
characteristics
of
the
more
usual
ornamentations
are
interesting
to
study
illustration
or
art
of
course
is
only
the
personification
so
to
speak
the
expression
of
the
mind
character
and
knowledge
of
the
artist
thus
in
ainu
ornamentations
we
have
patterns
which
could
be
nothing
but
ainu
taken
collectively
yet
which
show
distinctly
the
temperament
of
each
individual
for
instance
taking
the
figs
in
the
illustration
fig
with
its
roundish
undecided
lines
was
carved
by
a
man
weak
in
physique
and
fig
which
is
much
simpler
and
with
more
decided
lines
was
the
work
of
a
quiet
but
strong
and
proud
man
and
fig
with
its
coarse
incisions
was
the
outcome
of
a
brutal
mind
ainu
designs
though
slightly
varied
by
each
individual
are
principally
formed
of
simple
geometrical
patterns
then
of
coils
and
scrolls
and
rarest
of
all
because
the
highest
attainment
of
all
of
conventionalised
representations
of
animal
or
vegetable
forms
of
the
representations
from
animal
forms
the
is
the
only
one
adopted
by
the
ainu
but
suggestions
of
leaves
may
not
infrequently
be
found
in
these
designs
some
of
these
are
long
and
narrow
others
are
short
and
stumpy
illustration
suggestions
of
leaves
the
above
are
to
my
mind
the
models
which
the
ainu
have
chiefly
taken
for
their
leaf
patterns
following
nature
at
a
long
distance
indeed
illustration
and
simple

beside
these
and
much
more
common
are
the

the
simple
bands

bands
above
and
below
especially
in
drinking
vessels
triangles
filled
with
lines
parallel
to
one
of
the
sides
are
frequently
met
with
in
and
occasionally
the
annexed
patterns
are
found
but
as
a
rule
the
ainu
are
not
fond
of
merely
straight
single
lines
except
for
filling
purposes
these
patterns
are
mostly
used
on
their
graves
in
articles
of
use
they
prefer
curves
as
a
foundation
of
their
ornamentations
the
lozenge
pattern
especially
one
lozenge
inside
the
other
is
a
favourite
among
their
geometrical
designs
also
contiguous
and
detached
circles
chevrons
double
chevrons
and
triple
chevrons
the
chevrons
are
mainly
used
by
them
on
their
graves
and
they
are
invariably
enclosed
between
two
or
four
lines

angles

the
occurrence
of
a

parallel
lines
meeting
perpendicularly
another
lot

lines
have
a
fascination
for

that

rarely

saw
a
really
imposing
monument
put
over
the
grave
of
the
chief
who
had
recently
died
it
was
of
very
large
size
and
well
carved
in
the
same
patterns
as
those
shown
in
the
illustration
its
chief
peculiarity
was
that
the
body
instead
of
being
covered
by
earth
was
covered
by
what
appeared
to
be
a
canoe
or
turned
upside
down
the
bottom
of
which
had
been
laboriously
carved
on
each
of
the
two
sides
at
the
head
and
foot
of
the
grave
was
stuck
into
the
ground
a
wooden
blade
inches
in
length
resembling
in
shape
the
blade
of
a

each
of
these
four
blades
was
carved
alike
and
had
a
strange
design
resembling
the
number
whether
a
meaning
is
attached
by
the
ainu
to
this
design
i
can
not
say
and
the
curious
circumstance
as
my
readers
will
remember
through
which
i
came
into
possession
of
one
of
these
blades
did
not
permit
me
to
ask
many
questions
on
the
subject
i
often
wondered
whether
it
meant
that
life
begins
goes
its
way
round
and
ends
where
it
began
it
is
more
likely
though
that
no
meaning
whatever
is
attached
to
those
lines
for
such
deep
thoughts
would
hardly
harmonise
with
the
ainu
philosophy
such
as
it
is
the
ainu
do
not
stop
to
mourn
or
pray
or
trouble
themselves
about
a
grave
when
the
body
is
once
buried
those
who
have
touched
the
body
wash
their
hands
in
a
tub
of
water
which
has
been
brought
for
the
purpose
afterwards
the
water
is
thrown
over
the
grave
and
the
tub
is
smashed
the
ainu
seldom
visit
their
graveyards
except
when
some
one
has
to
be
buried
they
hate
their
dead
to
be
disturbed
and
nothing
makes
them
more
angry
than
to
know
that
a
stranger
has
been
near
their
when
a
man
is
dead
they
try
to
forget
all
about
him
and
his
doings
in
which
they
generally
succeed
to
perfection
this
naturally
is
not
conducive
to
anything
like
continuity
in
the
history
of
the
country
and
may
partly
account
for
their
having
none
moreover
none
of
the
tombs
bear
the
name
or
the
mark
of
the
person
to
whom
it
was
erected
tombs
of
children
are
of
similar
shape
to
those
of
adults
only
smaller
in
size
when
carrying
the
dead
or
as
we
should
say
going
to
a
funeral
the
ainu
put
on
their
best
clothes
and
when
the
burial
is
over
they
all
get
helplessly
drunk
to
make
up
for
the
loss
of
the
departed
friend
to
leave
this
somewhat
grim
subject
and
to
return
to
art
it
may
be
well
to
mention
that
the
designs
for
embroideries
differ
in
no
way
from
the
they
are
often
more
accurately
finished
owing
to
the
greater
facility
of
materials
but
the
lines
and
all
the
characteristics
of
the
patterns
are
the
same
in
the
tattoos
the
lozenge
pattern
and
bands
are
the
two
more
commonly
used
the
egyptian
cross
is
sometimes
met
with
illustration

also
a
kind
of
reversed
or
moreover
the
andrew
cross
with
an
additional
line
is
not
uncommon
in
the
present
volume
this
is
all
i
have
to
say
on
ainu
art
i
may
however
add
that
their
ornamentations
could
not
be
more
primitive
but
their
frequency
on
weapons
clothing
implements
and
graves
shows
us
that
art
though
not
understood
by
the
ainu
has
a
certain
fascination
which
in
their
ignorance
they
can
not
explain
they
know
art
without
knowing
what
art
means
certain
lines
and
simple
designs
which
are
familiar
to
them
appeal
to
their
taste
else
they
would
not
ornament
all
their
articles
with
them
but
this
does
not
show
any
great
intellectual
activity
for
beyond
that
point
the
ainu
brain
can
not
go
as
art
in
its
natural
state
is
merely
the
pictorial
outcome
of
what
the
brain
has
grasped
we
have
in
these
crude
beginnings
another
strong
proof
that
the
of
the
ainu
is
indeed
very
limited
and
their
inability
to
represent
animal
form
seems
extraordinary
in
view
of
what
other
savages
have
done
but
of
course
superstition
may
have
something
to
say
to
the
omission
the
ainu
rank
very
low
in
the
scale
of
civilisation
they
are
probably
below
the
australian
blacks
and
the
of
india
who
are
supposed
to
be
among
the
lowest
races
in
creation
the
terra

fuegians
and
certain
african

hard
but
taken
all

phenomena
and
exceptions
that
the
ainu
are
disgustingly
filthy
is
undoubted
that
in
many
ways
they
are
is
certain
but
also
that
on
a
close
examination
many
are
not
devoid
of
good
features
is
undeniable
as
regards
looks
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
compare
savages
with
ourselves
and
to
judge
of
them
from
our
own
standpoint
this
is
no
more
fair
than
to
compare
a
thoroughbred
with
a
thoroughbred
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
one
or
the
other
passing
off
as
pure
types
of
course
makes
things
ten
times
worse
and
complicates
matters
for
those
who
care
for
accuracy
and
are
interested
in
anthropological
researches
ainu
physiognomy
is
an
interesting
study
when
seen
the
forehead
is
narrow
and
sharply
sloped
backward
the
are
prominent
and
the
nose
is
hooked
slightly
flattened
and
broad
with
wide
strong
nostrils
the
mouth
is
generally
large
with
thick
firm
lips
and
the
underlip
well
developed
the
space
from
the
nose
to
the
mouth
is
extremely
long
while
the
chin
which
is
rather
round
is
comparatively
short
and
not
very
prominent
thus
the
face
has
the
shape
of
a
short
oval
the
profile
is
concave
and
the
mouth
and
eyebrows
are
prominent
though
of
course
the
nose
projects
more
than
the
lips
yet
without
being
too
markedly
projecting
the
chin
and
forehead
recede
as
has
been
said
and
in
the
supraorbital
region
the
central
boss
is
extremely
well
marked
also
the
brow
ridges
which
however
are
slightly
less
conspicuous
than
the
central
boss
the
ears
are
usually
large
flat
and
with
long
lobes
but
unfortunately
owing
to
the
heavy
weight
of
their
enormous
earrings
this
part
of
their
ears
is
generally
much
deformed
sometimes
i
have
seen
children
with
a
hole
in
their
lobes
large
enough
for
me
to
pass
my
finger
through
with
others
where
the
skin
was
not
so
elastic
the
lobes
were
torn
right
through
and
the
two
sides
hung
down
in
older
people
one
does
not
see
this
so
much
as
their
long
hair
entirely
covers
their
ears
the
average
length
of
a
man
ear
is
two
and
inches
of
a
woman
two
and
a
half
inches
people
have
classified
the
ainu
as
mongolians
notwithstanding
that
they
possess
no
characteristics
whatsoever
of
the
mongolian
races
the
colour
of
their
skin
is
light
and
not
yellow
and
sallow
like
that
of
mongolians
they
are
very
hairy
and
the
mongolians
are
the
features
of
the
one
race
are
diametrically
opposed
to
those
of
the
other
the
mouth
is
strong
and
firm
in
the
ainu
and
weak
in
the
mongolian
and
the
ainu
eyes
the
strongest
characteristic
of
mongolian
races
do
not
slant
upwards
nor
are
they
long
and
as
with
the
chinese
or
the
japanese
but
with
their
long
axes
are
in
one
horizontal
plane
as
in
most
europeans
indeed
the
ainu
have
a
much
greater
resemblance
to
the
northmen
of
europe
in
their
prehistoric
stage
than
to
any
modern
races
and
least
of
all
to
the
mongolians
but
let
us
examine
the
eye
more
carefully
the
iris
is
light
brown
sometimes
tending
towards
dark
grey
one
seldom
sees
black
or
very
dark
brown
eyes
save
in
and
they
are
deeply
set
as
with
europeans
the
eyelids
are
no
thicker
than
those
of
caucasian
races
though
they
droop
as
is
common
among
people
exposed
to
the
full
glare
of
the
sun
the
broad
ridges
being
very
heavy
and
prominent
cover
part
of
the
upper
eyelid
over
the
outer
angle
of
the
opening
the
eyelashes
are
extremely
long
and
the
eyebrows
are
shaggy
and
bushy
the
eyes
are
full
of
expression
and
emotional
warmth
a
thing
very
rare
with
their
neighbours
the
japanese
or
chinese
the
long
eyelashes
shading
the
large
eyes
and
rendering
them
soft
together
with
their
pathetic
and
slow
way
of
talking
make
men
and
women
singularly
interesting
like
most
animals
the
ainu
can
speak
with
their
eyes
the
hair
in
ainu
adults
is
for
the
most
part
black
wavy
and
easily
breaking
into
large
curls
among
children
however
one
sees
brown
shades
which
darken
with
years
until
the
hair
turns
quite
black
along
the
coast
of
yezo
i
came
across
several
ainu
adults
who
had
reddish
hair
and
beard
and
in
the
kurile
islands
at
shikotan
several
of
the
children
had
light
auburn
hair
hanging
in
large
loose
curls
and
rather
flaxy
in
texture
while
the
hair
of
adults
was
even
darker
than
that
of
the
yezo
ainu
the
hair
which
is
coarse
and
strong
is
uniformly
and
thickly
planted
over
the
whole
scalp
and
reaches
well
down
over
the
forehead
where
as
my
readers
will
remember
a
space
is
cut
out
or
shaved
off
it
grows
long
in
men
as
in
women
but
when
it
exceeds
ten
or
twelve
inches
it
is
generally
trimmed
in
the
shape
of
a
at
the
back
of
the
head
and
is
cut
off
level
with
the
shoulders
at
the
sides
the
men
have
a
luxuriant
beard
whiskers
and
moustache
which
grow
to
a
great
length
the
hair
of
the
beard
often
begins
directly
under
the
eyes
and
covers
all
the
lower
part
of
the
face
many
of
the
natives
also
have
a
few
short
coarse
hairs
on
the
nose
especially
noticeable
in
natives
of
the
coast
of
yezo
the
beard
whiskers
and
moustache
begin
to
grow
in
the
ainu
when
they
are
fairly
young
a
man
at
about
twenty
can
grow
a
good
beard
and
at
thirty
his
beard
is
very
long
ainu
women
whom
nature
has
not
provided
with
such
a
luxuriant
growth
of
hair
on
the
lower
part
of
the
face
make
up
for
it
by
having
a
long
moustache
tattooed
on
the
upper
and
lower
lip
which
in
their
idea
makes
them
look
very
manly
tattoos
baldness
is
not
common
among
thoroughbred
ainu
even
at
a
very
old
age
when
however
they
generally
turn
grey
and
then
white
which
gives
a
patriarchal
appearance
to
the
hairy
people
the
ainu
face
seldom
undergoes
the
marked
changes
common
to
civilised
nations
as
they
are
not
subject
to
large
emotions
but
different
expressions
are
as
easily
discernible
by
anyone
who
really
knows
and
has
studied
the
natives
as
the
different
expressions
in
the
eyes
of
animals
by
one
who
is
familiar
with
them
when
the
ainu
is
pleased
he
seldom
wrinkles
his
face
and
draws
back
his
mouth
at
the
corners
as
we
do
but
he
shows
it
by
a
peculiar
sparkle
in
the
eyes
and
by
an
almost
imperceptible
wrinkle
in
his
eyelids
which
contract
and
diminish
the
opening
the
corners
of
the
mouth
turn
slightly
upwards
the
smile
is
an
accentuation
of
this
expression
with
the
additional
lowering
of
the
eyebrows
especially
in
the
middle
near
the
nose
causing
the
forehead
to
wrinkle
laughter
ainu
know
not
during
my
long
stay
among
them
i
never
once
saw
a
ainu
laugh
heartily
for
the
hero
of
the
dab
of
blue
paint
laughed
less
than
he
roared
with
pleasure
and
i
do
not
remember
even
direct
crosses
doing
so
hence
travellers
have
reported
the
ainu
to
be
dull
sad
expressionless
certainly
the
first
thing
that
strikes
one
on
coming
in
contact
with
them
is
how
depressed
they
look
and
how
even
in
their
work
their
games
their
festivals
sadness
is
greater
than
joy
in
fact
the
ainu
with
their
sentimental
nature
enjoy
sadness
astonishment
and
surprise
are
expressed
by
a
perplexed
look
in
the
eyes
by
raising
the
eyebrows
and
by
the
contraction
of
the
mouth
the
hands
are
not
raised
nor
directed
towards
the
object
or
person
causing
astonishment
but
if
the
arms
be
hanging
down
the
fingers
are
widely
separated
with
the
ainu
sorrowful
emotions
are
more
marked
than
the
more
pleasing
the
more
joyous
thus
when
in
low
spirits
the
head
is
bent
forwards
the
eyes
are
staring
and
drooping
and
the
mouth
is
drawn
downwards
in
greater
grief
howling
is
added
to
these
signs
ainu
men
occasionally
indulge
in
quiet
tears
without
sobbing
but
women
weep
copiously
at
the
death
of
their
children
when
these
are
young
when
an
ainu
stands
very
erect
with
one
hand
in
the
other
in
front
and
turning
his
head
on
either
shoulder
throws
it
back
and
looks
down
at
you
with
expressionless
eyes
in
the
meanwhile
raising
his
eyebrows
you
may
be
sure
that
he
means
to
show
contempt
if
however
his
eyes
are
restless
and
his
lips
quiver
if
the
eyebrows
are
rapidly
brought
down
over
the
eyelids
while
he
opens
his
eyes
wide
showing
the
whole
of
the
iris
if
the
nostrils
are
inflated
and
he
breathes
heavily
if
the
head
is
thrown
forward
and
he
is
slowly
arching
and
as
the
french
say
making
a
round
back
you
may
be
certain
that
he
is
in
a
very
bad
temper
and
means
to
go
for
you
if
he
sees
his
way
to
it
when
obstinate
the
pose
of
the
arms
and
legs
is
similar
to
that
by
which
he
wishes
to
show
contempt
but
the
expression
of
the
face
is
absolutely
stolid
the
eyes
are
firm
and
frigid
meaning
in
that
way
to
impress
you
with
the
certainty
that
come
what
may
he
will
not
move
from
his
decision
when
actively
angry
the
ainu
sneer
and
snarl
at
one
another
frowning
ferociously
and
showing
all
their
front
teeth
but
specially
uncovering
their
fangs
or
dog
teeth
the
arms
are
stretched
out
but
always
with
the
fist
open
if
no
knife
or
other
weapon
be
held
in
the
hand
shame
and
disgust
are
two
expressions
which
one
does
not
often
see
on
ainu
faces
the
former
i
can
not
describe
for
i
never
saw
an
ainu
who
was
ashamed
of
anything
he
had
done
the
latter
is
manifested
by
an
upward
movement
of
the
corners
of
the
lips
and
a
curling
of
the
nose
with
a
sudden
expiration
almost
like
a
snort
shyness
which
is
the
nearest
approach
to
shame
is
shown
by
women
when
meeting
a
stranger
and
gives
them
a
submissive
look
they
bend
their
heads
and
look
down
until
the
first
emotion
has
passed
when
they
gaze
at
the
with
a
certain
restlessness
and
curiosity
again
as
in
so
many
of
their
gestures
and
ways
reminding
one
of
monkeys
i
never
found
any
shyness
whatever
in
ainu
men
neither
could
i
detect
in
them
any
signs
of
fear
for
objects
animals
or
powers
with
which
they
were
familiar
things
which
they
do
not
understand
of
course
frighten
them
like
eclipses
of
the
sun
or
moon
or
as
my
revolver
did
when
i
was
attacked
by
them
at
horobets
and
also
when
i
appeared
as
a
rider
on
the
coast
in
the
latter
case
unfortunately
i
was
too
far
off
to
see
their
faces
clearly
and
in
the
former
after
the
attack
they
showed
more
sensible
submission
to
the
inevitable
than
true
cowardice
what
i
chiefly
saw
then
was
here
and
there
a
face
with
undecided
eyes
heavily
frowning
while
some
of
the
others
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
closed
their
eyes
waiting
for
the
loud
report
of
the
revolver
which
unpleasant
noise
heard
before
from
japanese
guns
always
gives
a
shock
to
their
nerves
when
an
ainu
wishes
to
show
that
something
can
not
be
done
or
that
he
can
not
prevent
someone
else
from
doing
it
he
neither
shrugs
his
shoulders
like
a
frenchman
nor
shakes
his
head
laterally
like
an
englishman
nor
does
he
throw
out
his
hands
like
a
neapolitan
but
quietly
standing
erect
and
with
his
head
slightly
bent
forward
he
gently
lifts
it
up
and
slowly
winking
his
eyes
says
that
he
can
not
do
it
when
children
are
sulky
or
displeased
they
frown
and
protrude
their
lips
making
a
nasal
noise
similar
to
this
ohim
without
any
of
the
vowels
clearly
pronounced
our
way
of
nodding
the
head
vertically
in
sign
of
affirmation
and
shaking
it
laterally
in
negation
is
not
known
to
the
thoroughbred
race
those
either
ainu
or
who
practise
it
have
learned
it
from
the
japanese
the
right
hand
is
generally
used
in
negation
passing
it
from
right
to
left
and
back
in
front
of
the
chest
and
both
hands
are
gracefully
brought
up
to
the
chest
and
prettily
waved
downwards
palms
upwards
in
sign
of
affirmation
in
other
words
their
affirmation
is
a
simpler
form
of
their
salute
just
the
same
as
with
us
the
nodding
of
the
head
is
similarly
used
both
ways
it
is
quite
enough
to
look
at
an
ainu
eyes
to
see
at
once
whether
he
consents
or
not
just
as
it
is
quite
enough
to
look
at
a
monkey
face
to
know
if
it
will
accept
the
apple
you
offer
it
slyness
and
jealousy
are
well
marked
in
the
ainu
face
and
the
former
is
seen
in
the
glittering
restless
eyes
the
latter
in
the
sulky
glance
and
protruding
mouth
slyness
is
a
very
common
characteristic
among
ainu
men
jealousy
is
recognised
and
frequent
in
women
i
could
give
a
large
number
of
other
characteristic
expressions
of
less
ethnological
importance
but
in
the
present
work
i
shall
limit
myself
to
the
principal
ones
which
i
have
attempted
to
describe
leaving
out
altogether
expressions
of
so
as
to
avoid
confusion
i
must
beg
my
reader
forgiveness
for
the
dryness
of
the
imperfect
description
i
have
given
of
the
ainu
physiognomy
as
many
will
agree
with
me
that
it
is
a
great
deal
easier
to
notice
unfamiliar
expressions
on
faces
than
to
describe
them
accurately
in
so
many
words
illustration
ainu
man
walking
with
chapter
xxiii
movements
and
attitudes
the
ainu
people
may
be
called
physically
strong
but
yet
they
are
not
to
be
compared
to
the
caucasian
races
they
are
fairly
good
walkers
capable
mountaineers
and
deft
marksmen
but
they
do
not
excel
in
any
of
these
exercises
either
by
speed
and
endurance
in
the
former
two
or
by
special
accuracy
and
in
the
latter
in
the
ainu
country
most
of
the
hard
work
is
done
by
the
women
who
thus
surpass
the
men
in
both
endurance
and
muscular
strength
ainu
men
are
indolent
save
under
excitement
they
will
cover
a
long
distance
say
forty
miles
in
one
day
and
not
suffer
from
great
fatigue
while
they
will
not
be
able
to
walk
half
that
distance
under
less
exciting
conditions
the
average
distance
which
an
ainu
can
walk
in
one
day
on
a
fairly
level
track
does
not
exceed
miles
at
the
rate
of
two
and
a
half
miles
an
hour
the
distance
he
can
run
would
not
go
beyond
ten
english
miles
and
this
is
partly
from
want
of
training
as
he
never
runs
if
he
can
help
it
if
however
the
walk
of
miles
or
the
run
of
ten
miles
had
to
be
kept
up
for
several
days
in
succession
at
the
same
pace
few
ainu
could
manage
to
hold
out
for
more
than
three
days
at
most
while
a
walking
average
of
fifteen
miles
and
a
running
average
of
six
miles
each
day
could
be
kept
up
for
a
week
in
walking
and
running
women
are
as
good
as
men
in
one
day
distances
but
contrary
to
what
they
are
in
manual
labour
they
lack
endurance
in
locomotion
and
break
down
after
the
second
or
third
day
men
regard
running
as
unbecoming
after
childhood
if
we
must
go
quick
why
not
go
on
horseback
says
the
practical
ainu
who
is
as
perfect
a
horseman
as
the
indian
when
riding
he
is
able
to
cover
a
distance
of
miles
easily
in
one
day
on
a
good
pony
and
about
seventy
miles
if
he
changes
his
quadruped
four
times
both
men
and
women
ride
in
the
same
fashion
astride
and
nearly
always
on
bareback
or
with
simply
a
thrown
over
the
horse
are
only
used
when
carrying
wood
fish
or
other
heavy
articles
and
though
the
japanese
of
yezo
designate
these
by
the
name
of
ainu
saddles
they
are
only
in
reality
rough
imitations
of
their
own
though
women
do
ride
on
occasions
it
is
the
men
who
are
the
true
equestrians
from
their
infancy
they
spend
a
great
deal
of
their
time
on
horseback
while
women
ride
only
when
obliged
being
therefore
accustomed
from
their
earliest
days
to
ride
pretty
nearly
from
morning
to
night
men
can
stand
many
days
of
hard
riding
and
are
not
so
easily
exhausted
as
by
walking
or
running
the
ainu
are
good
at
as
we
have
seen
at
the
piratori
festival
but
even
when
the
distance
was
short
gave
but
poor
results
weights
and
burdens
are
carried
entirely
by
women
and
they
carry
them
either
on
the
head
if
the
load
be
not
too
heavy
or
on
the
back
by
means
of
a
or
simply
a
long
band
tied
round
the
bundle
leaving
a
loop
which
goes
over
the
forehead
thus
dividing
the
weight
between
the
shoulders
and
the
forehead
when
carrying
a
weight
with
the
the
woman
stoops
and
the
greater
the
weight
the
lower
the
head
has
to
be
the
strain
on
the
forehead
and
muscles
of
the
neck
is
greatly
modified
by
bending
the
body
more
or
less
the
weight
increasing
on
the
shoulders
in
proportion
as
the
pull
decreases
from
the
forehead
the
advantage
of
this
contrivance
is
that
it
leaves
both
hands
free
very
heavy
loads
can
be
carried
by
average
women
with
this
simple
contrivance
and
its
common
use
may
account
for
the
strong
and
necks
noticeable
among
them
but
not
among
the
men
children
are
carried
on
the
back
of
other
children
by
means
of
a
modified
that
has
a
stick
about
twenty
inches
long
the
two
ends
of
which
are
fastened
to
the
two
ends
of
the
band
the
child
carried
sits
comfortably
on
this
stick
while
the
centre
part
of
the
rests
on
the
head
of
the
this
centre
part
is
generally
lined
with
a
piece
of
skin
or
cloth
and
ornamented
with
a
few
simple
ainu
designs
a
weight
which
can
not
be
lifted
with
both
hands
is
easily
borne
for
a
long
distance
by
the
aid
of
the
and
i
should
think
that
with
it
a
strong
woman
could
carry
on
her
back
a
load
say
of
from
eighty
to
ninety
pounds
it
is
difficult
to
institute
comparative
tests
of
strength
as
constant
practice
without
counting
knack
often
enables
a
person
to
perform
feats
which
baffle
a
much
stronger
man
taken
altogether
the
ainu
strength
is
relative
to
their
height
but
they
are
somewhat
below
the
average
caucasian
races
both
in
endurance
and
yet
more
in
speed
and
muscular
power
illustration
the
for
carrying
children
when
actively
employed
the
ainu
can
abstain
from
food
for
fourteen
or
sixteen
hours
when
quiescent
for
about
twenty
they
can
go
without
drink
when
it
is
not
alcoholic
for
ten
or
twelve
hours
without
feeling
inconvenience
a
pebble
is
often
sucked
or
a
straw
is
chewed
when
fluid
is
not
obtainable
thus
causing
a
flow
of
saliva
which
to
a
certain
extent
quenches
their
thirst
however
the
reason
given
by
the
ainu
is
not
this
according
to
them
certain
stones
and
some
kinds
of
grass
contain
a
great
amount
of
water
more
interesting
to
me
than
their
physical
characteristics
were
their
movements
and
attitudes
which
i
was
able
to
study
and
note
correctly
without
their
observation
for
instance
when
ainu
try
to
move
some
heavy
object
they
pull
it
towards
them
thus
when
they
drag
their
and
canoes
on
shore
and
again
when
they
launch
them
they
never
push
from
them
but
always
pull
towards
them
if
an
ainu
has
to
break
a
stick
planted
in
the
ground
he
does
it
by
pulling
it
whereas
a
japanese
will
push
it
again
in
pulling
a
rope
the
ainu
pull
the
japanese
push
by
placing
the
rope
over
one
shoulder
and
walking
in
the
direction
wanted
in
a
crowd
where
a
japanese
would
push
his
way
through
by
extending
his
arms
and
thus
separating
people
the
ainu
seizes
a
man
on
each
side
pulling
one
to
the
right
and
the
other
to
the
left
till
space
for
him
to
pass
is
made
as
muscles
are
only
strengthened
by
exercise
it
is
not
astonishing
that
we
never
find
arms
among
the
hairy
people
who
so
seldom
make
vigorous
use
of
them
children
are
as
fond
of
climbing
trees
as
the
average
english
boy
and
sometimes
this
is
done
in
our
way
by
putting
the
legs
and
arms
round
the
trunk
and
gradually
swarming
up
but
with
trees
of
a
small
diameter
the
ways
of
monkeys
are
adopted
the
arms
are
stretched
and
one
hand
is
placed
on
each
side
of
the
tree
both
feet
are
then
pushed
against
the
trunk
keeping
the
leg
slightly
bent
but
stiff
one
hand
goes
rapidly
over
the
other
one
foot
above
the
other
and
so
on
and
the
more
rapid
the
movement
the
easier
the
climb
if
care
be
taken
to
plant
the
feet
firmly
so
as
not
to
slip
ainu
boys
are
dexterous
at
this
but
i
have
never
seen
men
attempt
it
though
i
am
sure
they
could
if
they
chose
elderly
people
are
very
sedate
in
ainuland
and
violent
movements
are
generally
avoided
where
the
ainu
are
indeed
great
is
at
making
grimaces
the
ainu
resemble
monkeys
in
many
ways
but
in
this
special
accomplishment
they
beat
monkeys
hollow
it
would
take
volumes
to
describe
all
the
different
grimaces
which
i
saw
them
make
especially
at
myself
while
i
was
sketching
them
but
one
or
two
of
their
favourites
may
prove
worth
describing
one
ainu
at
shari
on
the
coast
excelled
in
moving
his
scalp
and
by
raising
his
eyebrows
at
the
same
time
creased
the
skin
of
his
forehead
to
such
an
extent
as
to
make
his
eyebrows
almost
meet
his
hair
the
nostrils
were
expanded
and
the
upper
lip
was
raised
so
as
to
show
the
teeth
firmly
closed
the
same
man
was
also
good
at
moving
his
ears
others
preferred
to
put
out
their
tongue
emitting
at
the
same
time
a
harsh
sound
from
the
throat
although
many
ainu
could
not
voluntarily
move
their
scalp
they
often
did
so
unaware
when
eating
especially
if
a
piece
of
food
required
some
effort
to
swallow
the
neck
was
outstretched
the
mouth
closed
tight
the
eyebrows
raised
high
and
the
scalp
brought
far
forward
over
the
forehead
in
masticating
the
ears
would
sometimes
move
involuntarily
as
with
dogs
or
monkeys
the
ainu
are
also
good
at
rapid
winking
first
with
one
eye
then
the
other
each
eye
playing
at
an
inexpressibly
funny
kind
of
they
make
no
great
use
of
their
hands
and
it
is
not
uncommon
for
them
to
use
their
feet
to
assist
their
hands
indeed
their
toes
are
supplementary
fingers
and
they
often
hold
things
between
the
big
toe
and
the
next
as
when
making
nets
or
wooden
wands
with
overhanging
shavings
when
making
nets
the
string
is
firmly
held
by
the
big
toe
bent
over
when
shaping
the
lower
point
of
the
wand
is
passed
between
the
two
toes
which
keep
it
fast
while
the
long
shavings
are
cut
when
women
wind
the
thread
made
of
the
fibre
they
often
let
it
run
between
the
two
larger
toes
while
they
wind
it
on
a
spool
or
a
reed
then
again
the
toes
are
often
used
to
pick
up
small
objects
out
of
the
reach
of
the
hands
and
also
to
scratch
the
lower
extremities
the
two
middle
fingers
of
the
hand
and
the
three
smaller
toes
of
the
foot
are
seldom
used
by
the
ainu
and
are
somewhat
inert
the
little
finger
is
slightly
more
active
whenever
ainu
point
at
anything
they
habitually
do
so
with
the
open
hand
for
they
have
a
certain
difficulty
in
using
any
finger
separately
this
difficulty
is
not
so
great
with
the
first
finger
but
where
a
european
would
use
only
his
thumb
and
first
finger
an
ainu
uses
all
four
fingers
and
his
thumb
as
well
as
in
carrying
food
to
his
mouth
picking
up
small
objects
lifting
a
cup
pulling
his
own
hair
scratching
his
ears
that
the
ainu
have
more
muscular
power
in
the
head
than
either
in
the
hands
or
feet
when
violent
exertion
is
required
is
certain
as
i
had
frequent
proof
when
requiring
natives
to
make
my
baggage
fast
with
ropes
to
my
where
a
european
would
have
done
this
by
passing
the
ropes
round
the
baggage
and
pulling
them
fast
to
the
saddle
the
ainu
set
his
foot
generally
the
right
against
the
baggage
and
pulled
the
ropes
with
his
teeth
by
this
method
he
used
more
force
than
he
would
had
he
done
his
work
with
his
hands
though
the
ainu
are
very
supple
about
the
body
they
are
nevertheless
stiffer
than
we
are
about
the
knees
and
hands
which
last
peculiarity
prevents
them
from
learning
any
kind
of
they
are
supple
because
of
the
singular
flexibility
of
their
spine
and
the
looseness
of
their
arms
about
their
shoulders
when
resting
or
tired
the
shoulders
droop
so
far
forward
as
to
prove
that
the
muscular
tension
which
we
constantly
exert
to
have
square
shoulders
is
foreign
to
the
hairy
people
the
ainu
are
deficient
in
biceps
and
such
an
arm
as
a
blacksmith
or
athlete
which
is
not
uncommon
among
ourselves
is
in
ainuland
a
thing
unknown
their
muscles
have
not
the
firmness
of
those
of
civilised
men
want
of
use
entails
loss
of
power
in
the
muscular
system
and
that
unfortunately
produces
further
results
in
paralysis
and
rheumatism
in
the
legs
the
which
often
assumes
such
enormous
proportions
with
us
is
only
moderately
developed
with
them
though
it
is
generally
larger
than
the
biceps
owing
to
the
habit
of
walking
and
riding
notwithstanding
this
the
centre
of
muscular
power
as
we
have
seen
is
undoubtedly
in
the
head
as
with
inferior
animals
and
the
ainu
are
fully
aware
of
this
for
if
not
why
should
they
carry
all
weights
on
the
head
or
by
the
help
of
the
head
why
should
they
use
their
teeth
instead
of
their
hands
when
an
extra
powerful
pull
is
required
and
why
should
they
with
their
heads
when
pulling
with
their
teeth
is
not
practicable
having
examined
the
different
movements
of
the
ainu
let
us
now
take
some
account
of
their
attitudes
what
struck
me
most
was
the
unconscious
ease
with
which
they
stood
sat
and
slept
no
matter
in
what
circumstances
it
may
be
well
to
repeat
here
that
the
ainu
are
not
burdened
as
we
are
with
articles
of
furniture
and
a
code
of
manners
which
so
greatly
modify
our
attitudes
and
make
us
conscious
of
all
we
do
moreover
we
wear
crippling
boots
and
nonsensical
garments
which
besides
not
being
ornamental
more
or
less
alter
and
deform
different
parts
of
our
body
considerably
restrict
certain
attitudes
and
greatly
stiffen
some
of
our
limbs
as
for
example
the
exaggerated
smallness
of
waist
in
women
it
is
remarkable
what
a
close
resemblance
the
hairy
people
bear
to
the
prehistoric
man
as
constructed
by
out
of
skulls
and
skeletons
a
resemblance
found
i
believe
in
no
other
race
of
savages
take
an
ainu
standing
at
ease
he
carries
his
head
straight
but
without
stretching
his
neck
so
that
if
a
horizontal
line
were
passed
through
the
it
would
cut
the
face
directly
under
the
eyes
if
another
line
were
drawn
perpendicular
to
the
horizontal
we
should
find
that
the
front
of
the
face
is
not
on
the
same
plane
with
the
forehead
but
projects
considerably
beyond
in
its
lower
part
in
thoroughbred
ainu
the
head
is
well
posed
on
the
cervical
vertebræ
and
seldom
shows
an
inclination
from
back
to
front
from
right
to
left
or
but
in
an
inclination
forward
and
also
slightly
from
the
left
to
the
right
is
a
marked
characteristic
the
body
when
standing
still
is
a
trifle
inclined
forward
but
when
walking
the
inclination
is
greatly
increased
the
body
is
well
balanced
and
this
inclination
is
partly
due
to
the
head
being
abnormally
large
for
the
body
also
to
the
habit
of
keeping
the
knees
slightly
bent
either
when
standing
still
or
when
in
motion
the
women
through
carrying
heavy
weights
on
the
head
are
straighter
than
men
when
standing
as
well
as
when
walking
without
a
burden
their
spinal
column
describes
a
gentle
curve
inwards
while
with
men
it
has
a
slight
tendency
outwards
when
an
ainu
is
standing
at
rest
his
arms
hang
by
his
side
the
palms
of
the
hands
are
turned
inwards
with
a
small
inclination
towards
the
front
but
a
pose
which
is
even
more
characteristic
than
this
is
when
both
hands
are
placed
in
front
the
fingers
of
the
right
hand
overlapping
those
of
the
left
when
sitting
this
is
their
invariable
attitude
but
in
walking
the
arms
hang
by
the
side
and
no
swing
is
given
to
them
to
help
the
motion
in
running
the
arms
are
bent
and
sometimes
the
hands
are
kept
half
opened
about
the
level
of
the
shoulders
the
ainu
legs
notwithstanding
their
greater
muscular
power
than
that
of
the
arms
are
neither
stout
nor
but
they
are
wiry
the
hips
are
narrow
and
the
legs
are
slightly
curved
the
gait
is
energetic
but
not
fast
each
step
being
flat
with
the
foot
firmly
planted
on
the
ground
when
in
motion
the
feet
are
perfectly
straight
and
move
parallel
to
each
other
and
at
each
step
the
heel
and
toes
touch
the
ground
at
the
same
time
an
undeniable
proof
that
the
body
is
well
balanced
when
they
walk
the
ainu
walk
mostly
unshod
and
the
average
length
of
the
step
in
men
is
inches
from
heel
of
left
to
tip
of
right
foot
and
in
women
about
twenty
inches
the
average
number
of
steps
to
the
minute
is
in
men
and
in
women
where
the
ainu
is
seen
at
his
best
is
when
he
is
riding
bareback
he
sits
so
firmly
that
animal
and
rider
seem
to
be
only
one
body
the
knees
are
slightly
bent
and
the
legs
and
feet
hang
so
that
the
toes
are
a
great
deal
lower
than
the
heels
and
are
also
turned
in
no
voluntary
muscular
contraction
is
affected
on
the
muscles
of
the
legs
for
if
the
knees
are
bent
this
is
because
of
the
shape
of
the
horse
body
and
if
the
rider
sticks
on
his
steed
it
is
merely
by
the
counterbalance
of
the
dead
weight
of
his
two
legs
the
body
of
the
rider
is
quite
erect
when
riding
gently
but
on
increasing
speed
the
body
is
thrown
backwards
the
legs
remaining
in
the
same
position
the
single
rein
is
held
in
the
right
hand
resting
on
the
horse
mane
and
the
left
arm
habitually
hangs
or
rests
on
the
rider
leg
when
feeding
in
his
hut
the
ainu
sits
but
in
places
where
he
can
lean
against
something
or
out
in
the
open
he
squats
bearing
his
weight
on
both
feet
but
with
the
legs
bent
to
such
an
extent
that
his
head
is
on
a
level
with
his
knees
often
his
arms
are
rested
on
the
knees
themselves
and
food
is
passed
with
the
hands
to
the
mouth
to
be
then
torn
by
the
teeth
no
forks
spoons
or
chopsticks
are
used
by
the
thoroughbred
ainu
but
japanese
influence
has
induced
some
of
the
more
civilised
specimens
of
volcano
bay
and
piratori
to
give
up
partly
the
use
of
mother
nature
forks
and
take
to
the
chopsticks
also
to
adopt
some
ugly
tin
spoons
as
the
sign
of
their
adherence
to
civilisation
lastly
when
asleep
the
ainu
generally
lie
flat
on
the
back
sleeping
on
the
right
side
and
resting
the
head
on
the
bent
elbow
is
also
a
common
posture
and
when
sleeping
for
a
short
period
of
time
during
the
day
i
have
often
seen
men
still
sitting
bring
up
their
legs
cross
their
arms
on
their
knees
and
then
rest
the
head
on
the
arms
thus
placidly
having
a
nap
without
waking
up
with
a
stiff
neck
stiff
legs
and
pins
and
needles
in
their
arms
which
would
be
the
sure
result
if
the
average
european
tried
that
mode
of
repose
most
ainu
have
no
bedding
of
any
kind
and
most
of
them
sleep
on
hard
rough
planks
or
on
the
ground
itself
some
of
the
people
however
sleep
on
in
winter
as
it
keeps
them
warm
and
the
colder
the
night
the
closer
all
the
members
of
the
family
pack
together
to
warm
each
other
with
their
natural
heat
a
strange
peculiarity
when
ainu
are
asleep
lying
flat
on
their
back
is
that
instead
of
keeping
both
legs
fully
stretched
out
one
or
sometimes
both
are
raised
and
bent
with
the
sole
of
the
foot
planted
on
the
ground
this
peculiarity
is
chiefly
noticeable
in
men
and
i
have
observed
it
many
times
especially
in
old
people
the
reason
of
it
is
this
the
ainu
having
no
pillow
the
head
has
to
be
turned
so
far
back
to
rest
on
the
ground
itself
that
action
at
the
other
end
of
the
body
is
necessary
to
counterbalance
the
strain
on
the
spine
i
came
to
this
conclusion
by
being
often
placed
in
the
same
circumstances
as
the
hairy
people
themselves
when
i
found
that
lying
flat
on
my
back
on
the
hard
unpillowed
ground
if
the
legs
were
straightened
only
a
small
portion
of
the
spine
between
the
shoulders
was
supported
but
by
raising
the
legs
the
whole
spinal
column
rested
on
the
level
surface
as
we
have
now
seen
the
ainu
asleep
in
a
comfortable
attitude
we
shall
leave
them
for
the
present
and
i
shall
take

readers

coat
the
ainu
men
generally
go
naked
in
summer
time
but
in
some
parts
of
yezo
civilisation
has
forced
them
to
adopt
cheap
japanese
clothes
it
must
not
be
supposed
from
this
that
the
real
ainu
never
wear
any
clothes
at
all
for
indeed
on
grand
occasions
they
dress
gaudily
enough
but
always
in
a
rude
elementary
kind
of
way
for
winter
use
they
sew
together
the
skins
of
either
bear
or
deer
fox
or
wolf

a
kind
of
sleeveless
jacket
which
protects

the

is
large
at

very
narrow
at

a
still
further
protection
against

is
mostly
worn
by
women

an
besides

they
wear

illustration
back
of
atzis
on
the
southern
coast
some
of
the
civilised
tribes
have
either
adopted
japanese
altogether
or
make
their
after
the
same
pattern
to
ingratiate
themselves
with
their
masters
on
the
principle
of
imitation
being
the
sincerest
flattery
and
perhaps
also
because
they
come
cheaper
in
the
end
the
reaches
below
the
knees
and
is
folded
round
the
body
it
is
kept
in
position
by
a
girdle
or
belt
of
the
same
material
or
of
bear
or
skin
this
is
ornamented
with
embroidery
both
back
and
front
round
the
sleeves
round
the
neck
and
all
round
the
border
or
as
we
should
say
hem
the
embroideries
are
done
in
japanese
coloured
cottons
and
threads
the
colours
are
invariably
red
blue
and
white
on
a
background
of
this
yellow
cloth
they
have
the
same
characteristic
patterns
and
are
identical
with
the
ornaments
on
as
the
readers
will
find
in
the
chapter
on
the
arts
of
the
ainu
men
and
women
wear
of
the
same
shape
only
those
of
the
women
are
longer
than
those
of
the
men
and
reach
nearly
to
the
feet
moreover
the
patterns
which
are
embroidered
on
the
dresses
are
not
considered
suitable
for
the
women
and
women
who
by
the
way
do
all
these
embroideries
have
to
content
themselves
with
the
simplest
patterns
devisable
a
mere
thin
line
of
blue
stitches
but
they
give
to
the
men
a
more
elaborate
ornament
they
first
sew
on
heavy
bands
of
material
which
then
they
embroider
in
highly
complicated
patterns
thus
giving
a
much
heavier
and
handsomer
appearance
to
the
male
in
winter
the
sleeveless
fur
jacket
is
sewn
over
the

as
has
been
said
women
wear
the
gown

an
ainu
embroideries
vary
considerably
not
only
in
different
tribes
and
different
villages
but
also
in
each
family
according
to
the
talent
and
patience
possessed
by
the
embroidress
it
takes
an
affectionate
wife
a
year
or
longer
to
ornament
the
dress
of
her
beloved
husband
and
in
the
case
of
a
chief
robe
the
work
never
comes
to
an
end
as
additions
are
constantly
made
children
have
an
extremely
simple
embroidery
when
any
round
the
sleeves
and
hem
of
the
but
never
any
simple
or
elaborate
either
on
the
back
or
front
i
have
often
seen
women
working
patiently
hour
after
hour
while
sitting
on
the
tiny
door
of
their
storehouses
and
the
result
of
their
labour
would
be
half
an
inch
of
coarse
stitching
which
for
them
was
a
great
work
of
art
most
ainu
now
possess
needles
of
japanese
manufacture
but
in
former
days
they
had
only
bone
needles
and
instead
of
fine
japanese
thread
were
obliged
to
be
content
with
the
fibre
of
the
elm
tree
dyed
black
the
ornamentations
on
the
of
ainu
who
have
no
japanese
needles
are
necessarily
a
great
deal
coarser
and
simpler
than
those
which
are
done
with
steel
needles
and
cotton
threads
the
essential
characteristics
are
the
same
in
both
in
sewing
together
skins
for
winter
garments
needles
are
often
used
up
to
this
day
these
embroidered
clothes
when
new
are
only
worn
on
grand
occasions
as
at
a
bear
festival
or
when
paying
a
visit
to
a
neighbouring
village
a
few
rags
constitute
the
usual
costume
and
no
difference
is
made
between
the
and
the
clothing
in
fact
most
ainu
sleep
in
their
clothes
such
as
they
are
illustration
the
hoshi
one
article
of
dress
which
is
worn
by
all
alike
young
and
old
male
or
female
is
the
or
leggings
like
their
gowns
these
are
sometimes
made
of
the
inner
fibre
of
the
bark
and
sometimes
of
rushes
and
reeds
plaited
as
in
the
ordinary
rush
matting
when
of
bark
they
are
often
embroidered
in
the
upper
part
as
can
be
seen
in
the
illustration
they
are
fastened
just
under
the
knee
by
means
of
the
two
upper
strings
then
wrapped
tightly
round
the
leg
and
bound
round
the
ankle
with
the
lower
and
longer
ribbon
the
ainu
go
barefooted
in
the
summer
but
during
the
winter
months
when
the
cold
is
too
severe
for
this
they
cover
their
feet
with
mocassins
and
long
boots
made
of
and
often
of
when
the
ainu
goes
for
a
long
journey
or
a
hunt
during
which
he
has
to
traverse
rough
ground
he
generally
protects
his
skin
boots
the
soles
of
which
would
soon
be
destroyed
by
the
sharp
stones
and
ice
by
slipping
over
them
a
pair
of
thick
rope
sandals
which
protect
the
sides
the
back
the
toes
and
sole
of
the
foot
if
to
this
inventory
be
added
a
consisting
of
a
band
wound
round
the
head
and
an
occasional
apron
the
whole
of
the
ainu
wardrobe
is
catalogued
this
band
which
is
worn
principally
by
women
is
untied
and
removed
when
saluting
or
meeting
a
man
whether
on
the
road
or
in
the
woods
a
japanese
towel
often
takes
the
place
of
the
native
manufacture
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
this
custom
of
covering
the
head
has
been
acquired
from
the
japanese
as
none
of
the
ainu
of
the
upper
tokachi
the
only
pure
ones
remaining
wore
anything
in
the
shape
of
band
or
kerchief
while
it
is
extremely
common
with
the
ainu
of
volcano
bay
and
piratori
to
wear
these
unbecoming
towels
at
piratori
the
ainu
women
give
a
more
artistic
character
to
this
ugly
headgear
by
embroidering
it
in
front
and
wearing
it
like
a
tiara
an
apron
is
occasionally
worn
by
ainu
but
this
too
in
my
opinion
has
been
borrowed
from
the
japanese
ainu
clothes
often
get
undone
owing
to
their
shape
and
therefore
ainu
men
sometimes
wear
these
aprons
but
rather
because
they
are
made
to
wear
them
than
from
native
modesty
or
inclination
to
be
commonly
decent
i
have
seen
ainu
on
the
coast
of
yezo
and
on
lake
kutcharo
wear
coarse
hats
of
matted
rushes
when
laid
flat
these
hats
have
a
diameter
of
about
thirty
inches
but
when
worn
they
are
folded
in
two
and
kept
in
this
position
by
a
string
tied
under
the
chin
and
passed
through
the
hat
they
are
used
principally
in
winter
as
a
protection
against
the
snow
the
ainu
care
more
to
adorn
than
to
clothe
themselves
a
few
glass
beads
a
metal
earring
a
silver
coin
or
anything
that
shines
can
make
a
man
or
a
woman
as
happy
as
a
king
intoxicants
come
first
of
all
things
but
after
them
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
that
ainu
cherish
more
than
personal
ornaments
and
this
is
of
course
even
truer
of
women
than
of
men
what
strikes
a
stranger
when
looking
at
an
ainu
for
the
first
time
is
as
i
have
already
said
the
size
of
their
metal
earrings
and
heavy
glass
necklaces
as
the
ainu
can
not
work
in
metals
or
make
glass
these
ornaments
have
been
purchased
from
japanese
chinese
and
corean
adventurers
and
many
costly
skins
of
bears
foxes
wolves
or
seals
are
gaily
bartered
for
a
few
beads
worth
next
to
nothing
the
ainu
is
fond
of
metals
but
he
does
not
know
the
difference
between
one
and
the
other
all
that
glitters
is
gold
for
him
and
if
it
is
not
gold
then
it
must
be
silver
therefore
some
ainu
are
known
to
have
invested
all
their
fortune
of
valuable
furs
for
a
pair
of
brass
earrings
and
what
is
more
they
have
never
grudged
the
bargain
previous
to
the
importation
of
these
worthless
articles
their
ornaments
were
made
of
wood
bone
and
shells
of
which
survivals
are
still
to
be
seen
with
the
ainu
of
the
upper
tokachi
illustration
boots
to
be
soaked
in
water
so
as
to
take
shape
of
foot
and
to
be
kept
up
with
a
string

shoe
illustration
the
tarra
or
the
large
circular
earrings
are
much
prized
men
and
women
alike
wear
them
many
men
however
do
not
wear
these
metal
earrings
but
prefer
instead
a
long
strip
of
red
or
black
cloth
or
skin
the
lobes
of
the
ears
are
frequently
torn
down
by
wearing
these
heavy
earrings
from
early
childhood
and
they
know
not
how
to
mend
them
by
sewing
them
another
hole
is
sometimes
bored
in
the
upper
and
sound
part
ainu
women
of
civilised
districts
occasionally
wear
metal
but
these
are
of
course
of
foreign
make
and
imported
ainu
girls
seem
to
have
no
partiality
for
bracelets
or
amulets
but
necklaces
are
the
dream
of
their
life
the
delight
of
an
ainu
woman
in
a
new
necklace
is
in
proportion
to
the
size
and
number
of
the
beads
a
woman
who
possesses
one
of
extra
large
beads
is
envied
by
all
her
less
fortunate
neighbours
and
she
who
has
several
strings
is
at
once
admired
and
hated
by
all
the
womankind
of
the
village
for
indeed
ainu
women
are
human
enough
to
know
how
to
hate
each
other
the
beads
which
most
take
their
fancy
are
the
blue
black
white
or
metal
ones
the
larger
beads
in
the
necklace
are
in
front
and
the
rough
wooden
pendants
with
bits
of
bone
metal
or
broken
beads
inlaid
in
it
which
hang
to
the
necklace
rest
on
the
breast
large
japanese
are
often
used
as
pendants
by
the
volcano
bay
natives
the
ainu
of
the
upper
tokachi
region
had
none
of
these
beads
but
a
rough
wooden
pendant
was
suspended
round
their
neck
by
a
leather
string
girdles
are
worn
by
men
and
women
for
two
purposes
first
to
keep
their
clothes
together
next
to
support
the
large
knives
which
the
ainu
always
carry
with
them
the
ishikari
ainu
who
lived
formerly
in
sakhalin
wear
leather
belts
and
the
women
wear
besides
a
peculiar
cloth
headgear
both
these
articles
are
ornamented
with
drops
of
melted
lead
and
chinese
cash
sewn
on
to
the
cloth
these
are
all
the
articles
of
clothing
and
ornament
which
are
in
common
use
among
the
ainu
none
of
them
are
worn
as
symbols
of
rank
or
to
denote
virginity
no
ainu
can
explain
why
he
or
she
wears
one
thing
more
than
another
except
for
the
reason
that
he
or
she
likes
it
there
are
no
ainu
laws
as
regards
clothing
and
with
the
exception
of
the
chief
who
on
special
occasions
dresses
more
gaudily
and
wears
a
crown
made
either
of
shavings
or
dried
with
a
small
bear
head
in
front
they
all
dress
pretty
much
alike
a
chief
could
not
be
distinguished
from
a
commoner
by
his
everyday
clothing
speaking
of
personal
ornamentation
i
may
as
well
describe
the
way
in
which
the
hair
is
dressed
and
also
the
little
care
is
taken
of
the
long
hair
which
reaches
down
to
the
shoulders
it
is
never
washed
nor
brushed
nor
combed
at
the
back
it
is
cut
in
a
semicircle
round
the
neck
over
the
forehead
the
men
shave
a
small
part
of
the
long
hair
which
falling
over
their
eyes
is
uncomfortable
to
them
but
women
do
not
until
lately
this
shaving
was
done
with
sharp
shells
and
wives
shaved
their
husbands
the
process
was
said
to
be
rather
painful
and
the
thoughtful
women
have
now
adopted
knives
for
that
purpose
to
the
great
delight
of
the
stronger
sex
the
part
shaved
is
in
the
shape
of
a
lozenge
two
and
a
half
inches
by
two
inches
respectively
from
angle
to
angle
this
open
space
causes
the
hair
to
part
in
two
different
directions
and
hang
down
in
large
wavy
curls
the
fingers
are
occasionally
passed
through
it
and
then
with
the
palms
of
the
hands
it
is
plastered
down
on
both
sides
a
characteristic
ainu
method
of
making
the
morning
toilette
is
to
bend
the
head
low
and
let
the
long
hair
fall
over
the
forehead
the
two
hands
are
then
placed
under
it
on
the
temples
and
suddenly
and
violently
the
head
is
shaken
and
thrown
back
the
hair
being
pressed
down
by
the
hands
at
the
same
time
if
the
first
attempt
at
neatness
is
not
approved
of
the
process
is
repeated
two
or
more
times
i
must
confess
that
personally
i
could
seldom
see
any
marked
difference
between
a
head
of
hair
dressed
and
one
not
dressed
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
the
ainu
have
no
and
what
they
think
is
right
is
of
course
right
for
them
formerly
when
an
old
woman
lost
her
husband
she
had
her
head
entirely
shaved
and
when
the
hair
had
grown
long
again
she
repeated
the
process
as
a
proof
of
fidelity
and
affection
to
her
deceased
spouse
it
is
very
rarely
done
now
she
used
to
wear
a
sort
of
cap
with
an
aperture
at
the
top
round
the
crown
of
the
head
during
the
time
that
her
hair
was
short
and
it
was
incumbent
on
the
widow
to
wear
a
look
of
sorrow
and
pain
till
her
hair
grew
long
again
the
ainu
men
have
long
beards
and
moustaches
which
are
never
trimmed
with
the
exception
of
the
kurilsky
ainu
who
trim
theirs
the
beard
begins
to
grow
when
they
are
very
young
but
it
is
shaved
till
they
reach
manhood
it
is
then
left
to
grow
naturally
and
never
touched
again
as
long
as
they
live
ainu
women
whom
nature
has
not
favoured
with
such
a
manly
ornament
supplement
their
deficiency
by
having
a
long
moustache
tattooed
on
their
lips
their
hands
and
arms
are
also
tattooed
the
tattooing
among
the
ainu
is
limited
to
the
fair
sex
and
it
is
confined
to
the
head
and
arms
why
and
when
the
fashion
was
adopted
is
not
known
and
the
legends
on
the
subject
are
very
vague
one
legend
says
that
when
the
ainu
conquered
yezo
which
was
then
inhabited
by
a
race
of
dwarfs
the
some
women
came
to
the
ainu
camp
to
beg
food
from
them
and
they
did
so
by
passing
their
arms
through
the
reed
walls
of
the
ainu
huts
one
day
an
ainu
clutched
one
of
these
arms
and
pulled
it
in
when
a
tattooed
pattern
on
the
tiny
arm
was
greatly
admired
by
the
hairy
conquerors
who
adopted
the
practice
from
that
day
a
simpler
reason
is
that
the
women
not
being
so
hairy
as
the
men
are
humiliated
by
their
inferiority
in
that
respect
and
try
to
make
up
for
it
by
tattooing
themselves
in
support
of
this
theory
may
be
quoted
the
fact
that
women
are
only
tattooed
in
parts
which
are
left
uncovered
when
clad
in
their
long
gowns
the
ainu
process
of
tattooing
is
a
painful
one
the
tattoo
marks
are
usually
done
with
the
point
of
a
knife
not
with
tattooing
needles
as
by
the
japanese
many
incisions
are
cut
nearly
parallel
to
each
other
these
are
then
filled
with
sometimes
mixed
with
the
blood
from
the
incisions
is
used
instead
on
the
lips
the
operation
is
so
painful
that
it
has
to
be
done
by
instalments
it
is
begun
with
a
small
semicircle
on
the
upper
lip
when
the
girl
is
only
two
or
three
years
of
age
and
a
few
incisions
are
added
every
year
till
she
is
married
the
moustache
then
reaching
nearly
to
the
ears
where
at
its
completion
it
ends
in
a
point
both
lips
are
surrounded
by
it
but
not
all
women
are
thus
marked
some
have
no
more
than
a
semicircular
tattoo
on
the
upper
lip
others
have
an
additional
semicircle
under
the
lower
lip
and
many
get
tired
of
the
painful
process
when
the
tattoo
is
hardly
large
enough
to
surround
their
lips
the
father
of
the
girl
is
generally
the
operator
but
occasionally
it
is
the
mother
who
decorates
the
lips
and
arms
of
her
female
offspring
besides
this
tattooed
moustache
a
horizontal
line
joins
the
eyebrows
and
another
line
parallel
to
it
runs
across
the
forehead
the
tattoo
could
not
be
of
a
coarser
kind
a
rough
geometrical
drawing
adorns
the
arms
and
hands
of
women
the
pattern
of
one
arm
being
often
different
from
that
of
the
other
frequently
only
one
arm
is
tattooed
i
never
saw
tattoos
that
went
further
than
the
elbow
neither
did
i
see
any
other
part
of
the
body
tattooed
the
four
specimens
given
in
the
illustration
show
the
patterns
most
usual
in
different
tribes
though
each
individual
has
some
slight
variations
fig
was
copied
by
me
from
the
arm
of
a
woman
at
frishikobets
tokachi
river
figs
and
are
the
two
arms
of
kawata
tera
a
girl
of
tobuts
coast
of
yezo
and
fig
is
the
left
arm
of
a
girl
at
piratori
illustration
on
women
arms
it
will
be
noticed
that
in
the
regions
where
the
ainu
have
come
in
contact
with
japanese
rings
are
tattooed
round
the
fingers
while
the
tokachi
ainu
women
have
none
in
the
two
arms
of
kawata
tera
figs
and
the
dissimilarity
of
the
two
patterns
is
very
marked
at
first
sight
but
on
a
close
examination
it
is
easy
to
perceive
that
the
operator
meant
to
carry
out
the
same
pattern
on
the
right
arm
as
on
the
left
only
through
his
incapacity
to
reproduce
correctly
his
former
lines
or
for
other
reasons
he
got
muddled
up
in
the
design
and
left
his
work
unfinished
if
all
the
lines
in
the
upper
half
of
fig
were
continued
the
design
would
be
very
similar
to
fig
tattooing
is
considered
an
ornament
besides
as
i
have
already
mentioned
adding
the
coveted
air
of
virility
to
women
there
is
no
religious
feeling
connected
with
it
and
the
practice
is
rapidly
dying
out
as
the
japanese
men
make
fun
of
the
ainu
women
who
after
all
only
tattoo
their
mouths
and
arms
while
they
themselves
often
tattoo
the
whole
of
the
body
the
ainu
have
no
rules
as
to
when
the
girls
are
to
be
operated
on
they
are
done
both
before
and
after
marriage
contrary
to
what
has
been
said
that
the
women
do
not
tattoo
themselves
after
they
have
become
wives
the
moustache
is
generally
finished
before
a
girl
gets
married
as
she
herself
is
anxious
to
be
thus
decorated
but
there
are
no
rules
as
to
virginity
or
marriage
for
the
arms
and
hands
are
as
often
tattooed
after
marriage
as
before
indeed
in
the
ainu
country
tattooing
one
wife
seems
to
be
one
of
the
pleasures
of
the
honeymoon
the
design
of
these
tattoos
is
meant
to
be
but
is
seldom
symmetrical
the
ainu
apparently
execute
these
designs
on
a
preconceived
plan
but
the
results
rarely
come
up
to
expectation
as
no
drawing
of
the
design
is
prepared
beforehand
the
colour
of
the
tattoo
is
very
permanent
and
strong
and
many
an
ainu
woman
is
disfigured
for
life
who
according
to
our
ideas
would
otherwise

music
poetry
and
dancing
the
music
of
each
nation
has
certain
characteristics
of
its
own
and
though
according
to
european
ideas
the
music
of
what
are
called
barbarous
peoples
may
sound
in
some
sense
excruciating
it
always
has
a
certain
occult
charm
more
especially
to
one
who
is
able
to
forget
his
former
training
and
teach
himself
to
see
hear
and
think
in
the
same
way
as
the
natives
he
is
studying
undoubtedly
we
westerns
have
brought
music
to
a
pitch
of
refinement
that
no
savage
nation
has
even
attempted
to
reach
but
in
my
opinion
we
do
savages
injustice
when
we
call
their
music
unmitigated
discord
barbarians
like
the
ainu
do
not
indicate
their
rhythmical
effects
and
modulations
by
means
of
a
musical
notation
and
harmony
is
of
course
very
defective
with
them
from
our
point
of
view
on
the
other
hand
the
feeling
and
passion
with
which
they
chant
their
songs
make
them
go
straight
to
the
heart
if
as
a
melody
they
are
not
always
pleasing
to
the
cultivated
western
ear
an
ainu
seldom
sings
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
art
as
art
and
it
is
only
when
full
of
joy
or
crazed
with
care
that
he
gives
expression
to
his
feelings
in
music
then
he
pours
out
his
whole
soul
in
that
which
to
him
is
melody
beyond
the
power
of
words
to
compass
after
a
hunt
a
fishing
expedition
a
journey
or
a
misfortune
the
ainu
enters
his
hut
and
seats
himself
on
the
ground
he
then
holds
out
both
hands
with
the
palms
together
and
rubs
them
backwards
and
forwards
three
or
four
times
after
this
he
raises
them
palms
upwards
to
a
level
with
his
head
gracefully
lowers
them
to
his
knees
and
then
raising
them
again
strokes
his
hair
and
beard
again
he
lowers
his
hands
twice
thrice
or
even
more
times
according
to
the
amount
of
respect
to
which
the
person
saluted
is
entitled
the
latter
following
in
every
smallest
detail
the
motions
of
his
saluting
friend
when
this
complicated
salutation
has
been
performed
separately
before
each
male
member
of
the
household
the
new
arrival
relates
the
tale
of
his
and
if
the
events
be
of
an
unusual
character
the
story
is
chanted
in
a
sort
of
which
makes
each
note
of
joy
or
lamentation
vibrate
in
the
heart
of
the
listener
it
is
only
in
such
circumstances
of
stress
of
feeling
that
i
ever
heard
the
ainu
sing
though
sometimes
women
and
young
folks
when
alone
fishing
riding
or
travelling
sing
out
bits
of
their
past
lives
as
they
remember
this
scene
or
that
event
ainu
music
is
almost
entirely
vocal
and
their
singing
has
more
the
character
of
the
than
of
the
proper
their
songs
are
always
for
and
during
my
stay
among
the
hairy
people
i
never
heard
a
concerted
piece
nor
even
an
air
or
a
single
voice
with
a
chorus
for
a
number
of
voices
neither
did
i
hear
any
songs
performed
by
men
and
women
together
but
invariably
by
men
to
other
men
and
by
women
to
other
women
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reason
why
they
have
no
choruses
is
their
strict
etiquette
which
forbids
them
to
interrupt
a
speaker
till
he
has
finished
his
narrative
and
as
their
songs
are
only
narratives
which
the
musical
makes
more
impressive
it
seems
more
than
probable
that
the
reason
i
have
given
is
the
right
one
if
a
singer
during
his
narrative
stops
and
is
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
another
takes
up
the
lost
chord
in
exactly
the
same
intonation
of
voice
asking
a
question
or
singing
words
of
comfort
anger
or
scorn
as
the
case
may
be
but
no
ainu
ever
joins
in
the
song
before
the
person
singing
has
stopped
the
hairy
people
are
fond
not
only
of
their
own
but
of
all
music
and
their
ear
is
acute
enough
to
hit
a
tone
or
note
when
sung
to
them
and
even
to
remember
with
more
or
less
accuracy
a
short
air
after
they
have
heard
it
two
or
three
times
many
who
have
come
in
contact
with
the
japanese
have
learned
from
them
songs
of
a
totally
different
character
from
their
own
of
my
personal
experience
i
can
speak
of
a
boy
who
while
i
was
sketching
heard
me
sing
a
few
bars
of
the
an
hour
or
two
later
i
heard
him
repeat
this
passage
certainly
with
an
ainu
and
somewhat
ainuized
but
for
all
that
he
had
managed
to
catch
the
melody
which
showed
that
the
lad
must
have
had
some
musical
instinct
as
well
as
a
good
musical
memory
illustration
side
view
of
the
mukko
illustration
a
mukko
or
musical
instrument
the
ainu
are
remarkably
quick
at
reproducing
sounds
which
are
direct
imitations
of
noises
cries
of
animals
and
it
is
instinctive
in
them
as
when
children
they
are
not
taught
or
trained
to
do
so
the
education
of
ainu
children
is
indeed
a
thing
far
to
seek
in
every
way
and
what
they
know
is
nature
is
their
only
school
the
ainu
voice
is
pleasant
flexible
and
very
soft
in
quality
the
men
are
mostly
baritone
and
bass
the
women
alto
but
when
singing
a
falsetto
is
preferred
to
the
natural
voice
especially
by
the
women
and
this
always
without
an
instrumental
accompaniment
musical
instruments
are
more
than
rare
among
the
ainu
indeed
i
saw
only
one
which
is
now
in
my
own
possession
it
is
a
wooden
instrument
inches
in
length
and
three
wide
the
upper
part
is
flat
the
under
is
half
a
cylinder
scooped
out
by
a
knife
while
five
keys
are
fixed
in
the
short
neck
in
which
a
cavity
is
cut
leaving
a
space
for
the
strings
to
be
tied
to
each
key
the
top
is
circular
and
flattened
on
each
side
one
very
small
hole
is
bored
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
instrument
and
another
is
at
the
lower
end
where
the
point
of
a
triangular
piece
of
leather
seven
inches
long
is
passed
through
and
fastened
by
a
knot
tied
in
the
leather
on
the
opposite
side
the
five
strings
which
are
of
fibre
are
fastened
to
this
leather
piece
and
then
to
each
key
a
peculiarity
of
this
instrument
is
that
it
has
two
bridges
and
they
are
placed
at
each
end
of
the
harmonic
case
the
ainu
call
it
which
word
however
means
only
a
musical
instrument
and
as
it
is
applied
by
them
to
all
japanese
instruments
of
music
it
shows
that
they
do
not
distinguish
very
sharply
one
instrument
from
another
though
in
my
long
journeying
i
found
one
of
these
i
was
never
able
to
discover
any
ainu
who
could
play
on
it
and
the
ainu
of
ishikari
from
whom
i
bought
it
told
me
that
the
man
the
only
one
who
could
play
on
it
was
dead
this
was
unfortunate
as
none
of
the
others
could
tell
me
how
he
tuned
it
and
one
old
man
in
attempting
to
solve
the
problem
broke
three
strings
seeing
that
i
was
then
quite
unable
to
learn
any
of
the
tunes
of
the
deceased
ainu
paganini
i
purchased
the
instrument
and
found
by
the
natives
that
it
was
played
by
twanging
the
strings
with
the
fingers
and
not
with
a
plectrum
as
is
the
case
with
the
japanese
in
the
illustration
i
have
faithfully
drawn
a
front
and
a
side
view
of
this
instrument
so
as
to
give
the
reader
an
exact
idea
of
its
shape
the
ainu
of
volcano
bay
sometimes
make
bamboo
for
their
children
but
even
those
are
very
uncommon
so
we
might
as
well
define
ainu
music
as
entirely
vocal
ainu
music
is
sentimental
and
not
displeasing
but
it
is
monotonous
and
continually
repeats
itself
it
is
difficult
to
establish
a
rule
as
to
what
order
of
intervals
their
music
is
founded
on
as
their
progressions
modulations
and
rhythmical
effects
are
often
so
peculiar
as
to
make
it
impossible
to
indicate
them
accurately
by
means
of
our
musical
notation
but
the
nearest
approach
to
it
is
the
diatonic
minor
scale
the
ainu
are
fond
of
chromatic
intervals
and
when
their
recital
comes
to
an
exciting
point
they
make
use
of
this
method
in
a
to
give
strength
to
the
narrative
especially
at
the
end
of
the
tune
which
invariably
winds
up
in
the
tonic
the
intervals
which
are
of
most
frequent
occurrence
in
the
ainu
tunes
are
as
follows
illustration
the
tunes
seldom
contain
modulations
from
one
key
into
another
except
in
the
case
of
improvisators
who
sometimes
indulge
in
such
a
luxury
especially
when
intoxicated
but
the
usual
modulation
is
generally
begun
and
in
irregular
time
and
is
sometimes
like
a
slow
lamentation
gradually
and
irregularly
increasing
in
force
some
notes
marked
violently
and
the
next
very
faintly
thus
giving
a
weird
effect
of
light
and
shade
when
a
sentence
comes
to
an
end
there
is
a
chromatic
interval
and
the
keynote
generally
concludes
the
tune
the
melody
repeats
itself
again
in
the
next
sentence
sometimes
altering
the
into
and
according
to
the
force
which
the
narrator
wishes
to
give
to
certain
words
the
ainu
as
far
as
i
could
judge
have
no
fixed
rhythmical
method
and
each
man
constructs
his
own
their
melodies
are
generally
short
and
simple
and
the
same
phrases
and
passages
in
fact
usually
the
whole
melody
occur
again
and
again
in
their
songs
no
ainu
melody
that
i
heard
was
constructed
according
to
any
rule
of
musical
form
all
were
invariably
of
one
part
only
in
which
the
name
of
the
tune
was
often
applied
to
a
certain
form
of
rude
poetical
composition
for
instance
some
of
the
legends
which
unfortunately
are
not
purely
ainu
are
chanted
in
a
musical
intonation
and
are
a
kind
of
extempore
composition
though
the
roots
of
the
songs
and
the
verse
have
probably
been
brought
down
from
former
generations
this
is
proved
by
the
preservation
in
them
of
some
obsolete
words
and
forms
of
speech
which
are
never
used
in
current
conversation
and
which
none
of
the
younger
folks
can
understand
or
explain
i
believe
however
that
none
of
these
legends
are
very
old
the
ainu
having
no
written
language
it
is
but
natural
that
their
tradition
and
legends
should
have
been
greatly
changed
and
corrupted
especially
by
intercourse
with
the
more
imaginative
japanese
it
is
to
be
noted
however
that
the
ainu
though
to
a
certain
extent
as
imitative
as
monkeys
have
also
a
large
amount
of
personality
and
originality
due
to
their
shy
and
unsocial
habits
this
originality
is
not
surprising
when
we
remember
that
they
are
taught
nothing
and
that
each
man
provides
for
himself
and
his
family
but
has
no
markedly
friendly
feelings
towards
his
neighbours
in
other
words
it
is
a
state
of
degradation
very
similar
to
that
of
wild
animals
perfect
indifference
is
shown
by
the
people
of
one
village
towards
those
of
another
they
are
neither
friends
nor
foes
all
have
a
right
to
live
but
as
for
helping
one
another
that
is
out
of
the
question
having
no
written
documents
each
man
in
his
manner
recites
and
sings
as
best
pleases
himself
such
verses
or
legends
as
he
has
heard
from
his

or
from
some
other
person
and
the

is
that
according
to
the

greater
or

and
musical

the

composition
already
altered
by
his

is
again
altered
by

which
makes

a
composition
of
his

this
transformation
of
a
given
theme
is
common
even
among
civilised
nations
when
people
are
set
to
repeat
the
same
story
verbally
transmitted
from
one
to
the
other
the
version
of
the
third
person
has
but
little
in
common
with
that
of
the
first
if
this
we
do
with
a
spoken
narrative
how
much
more
with
tunes
learned
by
ear
only
and
characterised
in
the
delivery
by
individual
temperament
and
transient
mood
the
ainu
do
not
teach
these
legends
to
their
children
and
if
learned
at
all
they
are
merely
picked
up
by
ear
and
in
a
manner
at
random
therefore
most
ainu
profess
ignorance
as
to
their
existence
and
a
man
when
i
asked
him
if
he
knew
any
scornfully
answered
in
these
identical
words
translated
the
ainu
are
taught
nothing
and
they
know
nothing
the
few
legends
that
i
heard
were
told
me
by
benry
at
piratori
and
by
another
old
man
the
chief
of
a
village
up
the
saru
river
the
title
of
one
was
twice
below
the
story
of
yoshitsune
a
japanese
hero
and
a
japanese
of
yoshitsune
who
came
to
yezo
and
had
a
great
struggle
with
a
huge
fish
which
was
harpooned
by
them
and
disappeared
twice
under
the
water
capsizing
the
boat
which
contained
the
two
fishermen
temper
was
roused
and
he
cut
the
rope
to
which
the
harpoon
was
fastened
the
fish
went
to
die
at
the
mouth
of
the
saru
river
when
plains
of
hemp
sprouted
out
of
its
body
a
kind
of
hemp
another
legend
called
is
a
rather
different
and
more
simple
version
of
story
which
i
have
just
related
yet
another
variant
of
the
same
legend
is
found
in
the
or
a
summer
story
literally
translated
hear
relate
summer
which
was
so
very
confused
that
i
could
not
make
head
or
tail
of
its
minuter
details
but
like
the
it
was
about
a
famine
in
the
ainu
land
then
there
was
a
fourth
which
went
by
the
name
of
burning
to
embrace
or
it
was
again
about
yoshitsune
who
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
pretty
ainu
maid
and
could
not
eat
either
good
or
bad
fish
until
she
appeared
to
him
in
a
dream
as
yoshitsune
was
a
man
he
got
over
his
love
and
taught
the
ainu
not
to
be
deceived
by
woman
wiles
these
and
other
similar
legends
some
of
which
do
not
bear
repeating
being
too
improper
can
be
collected
at
piratori
or
on
volcano
bay
from
the
ainu
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
they
are
mostly
concoctions
of
japanese
ideas
construed
or
misconstrued
in
the
ainu
language
ainu
do
not
indulge
in
poetic
compositions
which
have
a
definite
metre
nor
do
they
use
special
words
for
rhyme
or
rhythm
but
all
the
words
in
their
songs
are
intelligible
and
seldom
meaningless
syllables
are
used
as
in
many
of
the
chants
of
other
savage
nations
this
of
course
is
because
as
has
been
said
their
songs
are
merely
a
form
of
conversation
adopted
on
certain
occasions
some
of
their
music
seems
to
have
been
suggested
to
them
by
such
animal
sounds
as
the
plaintive
howling
of
bears
wolves
and
dogs
music
is
believed
by
the
ainu
to
have
the
power
of
curing
illness
or
rather
of
scaring
away
from
the
body
those
evil
spirits
which
are
supposed
to
have
taken
possession
of
it
but
when
used
as
exorcism
the
music
is
no
longer
grave
slow
and
sentimental
but
verily
diabolical
consisting
mainly
of
wild
howling
with
an
accompaniment
of
stamping
feet
and
the
rattling
of
sword
and
knife
and
followed
by
a
disgusting
expectoration
of
chewed
convolvulus
roots
which
are
said
to
be
powerful
in
expelling
the
evil
spirit
and
restoring
the
sick
person
to
health
furthermore
music
is
invariably
used
by
the
ainu
especially
by
the
women
to
facilitate
manual
labour
as
when
pounding
millet
rowing
pulling
canoes
on
shore
or
drawing
water
from
a
well
when
packing
or
when
preparing
salmon
for
the
winter
and
also
in
their
games
which
i
have
already
described
in
the
chapter
on
the
festival
at
piratori
during
the
process
of
pounding
millet
which
is
only
practised
in
the
southern
part
of
yezo
two
or
three
girls
stand
round
a
mortar
in
which
the
millet
has
been
placed
and
each
girl
holding
with
both
hands
a
pestle
beats
and
sings
one
after
the
other
the
words
as
the
pestle
is
let
down
increasing
in
loudness
when
the
grain
requires
harder
pounding
and
slowly
decreasing
in
volume
towards
the
end
this
pounding
begins
about
sunset
and
the
place
chosen
for
the
operation
is
generally
the
small
porch
of
the
huts
it
has
indeed
a
weird
effect
to
hear
these
many
voices
from
the
distant
huts
gradually
dying
away
as
darkness
comes
on
till
finally
only
two
or
three
break
the
stillness
of
the
coming
night
then
even
those
wear
away
and
everything
becomes
as
silent
as
the
grave
when
riding
on
horseback
especially
if
alone
young
men
are
fond
of
singing
and
when
going
through
forests
chopping
and
collecting
firewood
ainu
invariably
sing
i
have
often
heard
two
or
three
ainu
when
packing
within
a
few
yards
of
one
another
each
singing
to
himself
and
each
so
much
absorbed
in
his
own
composition
as
not
to
even
hear
his
neighbours
an
ainu
does
not
and
can
not
sing
unless
he
feels
in
the
mood
for
it
but
if
he
sings
he
is
carried
away
by
his
own
music
of
course
this
is
a
good
quality
in
ainu
music
as
in
all
arts
where
feeling
is
to
be
appreciated
as
much
as
execution
the
latter
is
to
be
got
by
constant
practice
and
teaching
but
the
first
has
to
be
born
in
one
my
readers
must
forgive
me
if
i
am
judging
ainu
music
not
from
the
european
but
from
the
native
standpoint
for
i
think
it
is
only
fair
to
give
things
as
they
are
without
too
much
reference
to
our
own
ideas
with
savage
nations
music
is
the
expression
of
the
feelings
and
passions
of
the
musician
thus
it
is
necessary
to
well
know
the
man
himself
before
we
can
understand
his
productions
and
appreciate
them
and
such
knowledge
is
only
attained
by
constantly
living
with
natives
not
as
a
mere
stranger
but
as
one
of
them
very
few
travellers
have
seen
the
real
ainu
or
studied
them
accurately
while
many
partly
owing
to
their
inability
to
differentiate
one
race
from
another
have
given
us
highly
imaginative
descriptions
and
even
photographs
of
japanese
and
actual
japanese
describing
them
as
ainu
if
such
worthy
ethnologists
as
have
visited
the
civilised
part
only
of
the
ainu
country
have
been
unable
to
distinguish
types
of
the
hairy
ainu
race
from
those
of
the
hairless
japanese
or
from
mixtures
of
the
two
undoubtedly
racial
characteristics
have
been
but
imperfectly
recorded
it
is
more
particularly
in
music
and
poetry
as
i
have
already
explained
that
temperamental
characteristics
are
shown
and
one
ought
to
be
careful
to
clearly
define
what
is
native
music
and
poetry
in
which
i
include
legends
traditions
and
and
what
has
been
transmitted
by
neighbouring
and
conquering
races
loud
music
is
not
appreciated
by
the
ainu
and
makes
them
grin
with
more
scorn
than
enjoyment
i
could
only
try
experiments
in
this
direction
by
singing
to
them
as
i
had
no
european
musical
instruments
with
me
but
i
found
that
singing
at
the
top
of
my
voice
was
not
so
pleasing
to
them
as
when
i
sang
con
for
instance
the
song
toreador
in
the
opera
created
fits
of
merriment
from
a
crowd
at
frishikobets
while
the
same
crowd
a
few
minutes
later
listened
attentively
and
silently
to
gounod
ave
maria
sung
in
a
kind
of
miaoling
voice
i
may
here
mention
incidentally
to
show
the
different
musical
tastes
of
ainu
and
japanese
that
some
months
previous
to
this
i
was
at
a
concert
at
tokio
in
which
the
same
ave
maria
was
performed
by
some
distinguished
european
musicians
the
large
japanese
audience
who
had
been
attentive
and
till
then
went
into
fits
of
laughter
when
gounod
masterpiece
was
played
and
all
through
it
the
noise
of
people
laughing
was
so
great
as
to
drown
entirely
the
orchestra
and
singers
some
of
the
women
in
the
audience
nearly
went
into
hysterics
at
the
long
notes
at
the
beginning
of
the
piece
louder
melodies
and
of
a
livelier
character
did
not
affect
them
so
i
wish
to
draw
attention
to
this
fact
that
amongst
all
primitive
peoples
the
native
music
is
sad
and
slow
the
livelier
melodies
coming
later
and
also
that
with
both
wild
and
domestic
animals
the
most
noteworthy
effects
are
produced
by
slow
and
simple
music
we
all
know
how
dogs
will
remain
quiet
and
calm
when
a
soft
and
gentle
air
is
played
but
get
furious
to
the
point
of
savageness
under
the
of
a
merry
noisy
tune
as
for
the
last
item
connected
with
ainu
music
dancing
it
is
rarely
practised
even
by
the
ainu
women
to
whom
alone
it
pertains
at
the
best
it
is
of
a
very
rude
form
in
the
piratori
festival
chapter
iv
we
have
seen
that
their
dancing
is
accompanied
by
rhythmical
sounds
imitating
the
noises
produced
by
implements
in
everyday
use
as
the
squeaking
of
a
paddle
by
the
friction
on
the
canoe
the
cry
which
accompanies
the
pounding
of
millet
blowing
alight
the
fire
and
similar
sounds
time
is
kept
by
clapping
the
hands
and
by
vociferations
which
tell
the
partners
what
position
or
action
to
assume
each
action
being
accompanied
by
a
different
sound
but
all
performed
while
the
hopping
is
kept
up
i
have
not
felt
justified
in
classifying
these
rhythmical
sounds
which
accompany
the
dancing
as
choruses
for
there
is
not
enough
in
them
to
constitute
either
a
tune
or
a
melody
they
are
suggested
more
by
the
action
of
the
arms
and
upper
part
of
the
body
than
by
the
steps
in
fact
if
it
were
not
for
the
continuous
hopping
it
would
be
more
accurate
to
describe
ainu
dancing
as
posturing
the
dancers
form
a
circle
with
sometimes
one
or
two
children
in
the
centre
as
there
are
no
professional
musicians
there
are
no
professional
dancers
but
though
each
man
may
be
his
own
composer
of
music
the
women
never
alter
their
dances
which
are
handed
down
unchanged
from
one
generation
to
another
it
is
only
at
festivals
that
the
dance
is
performed
and
never
inside
the
huts
but
in
the
open
air
it
is
not
for
the
amusement
of
spectators
for
besides
one
or
two
of
the
older
women
spectators
there
are
none
but
it
is
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
dancers
themselves
the
men
do
not
seem
to
take
the
slightest
interest
in
the
dancing
and
apparently
regard
it
as
unmanly
they
remain
in
the
hut
drinking
while
the
girls
enjoy
themselves
in
this
way
outside
and
should
one
of
them
by
chance
come
out
he
would
stop
and
look
on
no
more
than
men
in
civilised
countries
would
stop
and
watch
little
children
at
play
on
the
other
hand
on
such
occasions
ainu
matrons
squat
in
a
semicircle
not
far
from
the
dancers
and
keep
up
a
or
sometimes
quarrelsome
conversation
among
themselves
and
occasionally
encourage
the
girls
in
their
hopping
and

heredity
crosses
psychological
observations
the
mental
qualities
of
the
ainu
are
not
many
and
what
they
have
are
by
no
means
great
nor
are
they
improved
by
education
for
what
they
know
comes
more
from
inheritance
than
personal
acquirement
though
naturally
every
rule
has
its
exceptions
i
repeatedly
noticed
that
talent
such
as
it
was
ran
in
certain
families
the
members
of
which
were
all
more
or
less
intelligent
certain
families
were
more
musical
than
others
other
families
were
more
artistic
if
indeed
such
a
word
could
be
applied
to
the
very
low
development
of
the
artistic
faculty
when
at
its
best
among
the
hairy
people
various
members
of
one
household
were
potently
insane
others
were
as
potently
idiotic
i
shall
not
class
under
this
heading
of
heredity
transmitted
disease
like
leprosy
consumption
but
i
shall
limit
myself
to
heredity
in
physical
traits
and
mental
qualities
unfortunately
with
the
ainu
intercourse
between
the
sexes
is
so
imperfectly
regulated
as
to
often
lead
one
to
erroneous
conclusions
the
reader
may
easily
imagine
the
difficulty
of
establishing
precise
rules
of
transmission
in
a
race
like
the
ainu
where
castes
are
not
marked
with
the
exception
of
the
chieftainship
in
each
village
the
only
necessary
qualifications
for
which
are
a
sound
sharp
intellect
a
strong
physique
and
personal
courage
the
office
is
hereditary
if
these
qualifications
are
also
inherited
but
should
the
sons
or
brothers
of
the
chief
prove
unworthy
of
his
place
the
ainu
would
assemble
in
a
village
council
and
elect
another
strong
and
brave
man
in
place
of
the
thus
summarily
deposed
these
chiefs
have
no
absolute
authority
though
the
men
often
consult
them
in
their
quarrels
and
difficulties
which
they
are
asked
to
settle
thus
because
of
these
qualities
necessary
for
the
office
these
chiefs
are
a
slightly
superior
type
to
the
other
natives
for
with
savages
as
with
civilised
people
strong
and
brave
men
are
naturally
of
a
finer
type
than
those
who
are
their
inferiors
in
these
qualities
but
the
difference
among
the
best
ainu
and
the
worst
is
so
small
that
i
do
not
feel
justified
in
classing
chiefs
as
of
a
different
caste
besides
exceptional
beauty
strength
or
larger
stature
is
not
necessarily
transmitted
in
the
families
of
chiefs
nor
do
the
ainu
themselves
consider
them
than
others
as
ainu
laws
of
marriage
have
no
relation
to
the
physical
and
moral
improvement
of
the
race
the
only
way
of
classifying
the
natives
for
purposes
of
heredity
is
by
tribes
each
village
being
considered
as
a
tribe
ainu
villages
are
generally
very
small
and
the
inhabitants
of
each
village
intermarry
among
themselves
therefore
each
member
of
the
community
is
in
some
way
related
to
every
other
member
hence
heredity
in
certain
physical
traits
mental
qualities
and
diseases
shows
itself
in
one
community
and
not
in
another
the
difficulty
of
tracing
the
exact
connection
of
each
individual
with
his
or
her
relations
beyond
the
acknowledged
father
and
mother
also
baffles
research
in
more
minute
details
abnormal
formations
are
sometimes
transmitted
to
many
members
of
one
tribe
as
for
instance
the
and
webbed
fingers
of
which
deformities
two
or
three
specimens
could
be
found
in
a
small
village
numbering
fifteen
or
twenty
houses
malformation
of
the
umbilicus
is
common
sometimes
in
almost
every
member
of
one
small
community
while
it
is
very
rare
in
others
children
are
mostly
affected
by
this
as
in
some
villages
the
cord
is
not
treated
at
all
at
birth
and
this
leads
to
an
abnormality
till
the
child
grows
older
when
the
few
who
survive
seem
to
get
all
right
in
other
villages
the
cord
is
fastened
in
a
very
primitive
not
to
say
imperfect
manner
with
a
common
string
of
fibre
albinism
is
very
uncommon
among
the
ainu
i
do
not
know
of
any
case
when
it
has
been
transmitted
as
albinos
are
greatly
disregarded
by
the

told

hair

among

kurilsky
ainu
of
shikotan
where
nearly
all
the
children
have
light
hair
it
darkens
considerably
as
they
grow
older
as
many
of
the
men
said
they
had
light
hair
when

the
love
of
fishing
some
tribes
have
a
musical
aptitude
and
a
certain
artistic
talent
for
rough
ornamentations
on
wood
others
have
developed
their
inherited
power
of
sustaining
hunger
and
thirst
the
only
characteristic
which
all
the
different
tribes
have
inherited
without
exception
is
love
for
intoxicating
drinks
and
this
love
is
not
only
inherited
by
thoroughbred
ainu
but
also
by
mixed
marriages
between
japanese
and
ainu
are
frequent
but
the
progeny
are
unfortunate
beings
of
whom
a
large
percentage
die
when
very
young
those
who
live
are
generally
malformed
and
often
idiotic
their
sight
and
hearing
are
not
so
acute
as
with
the
pure
ainu
and
crosses
are
said
to
be
sterile
with
very
few
exceptions
if
children
of
second
crosses
are
born
they
seldom
live
to
be
more
than
five
years
old
are
invariably
from
a
japanese
man
with
an
ainu
woman
but
occasionally
an
ainu
man
marries
or
cohabits
with
a
woman
i
have
never
seen
a
ainu
man
marry
a
japanese
woman
the
majority
of
are
males
i
should
think
males
and
females
the
women
are
physically
finer
than
the
men
but
they
are
said
to
be
very
generally
if
not
uniformly
sterile
the
products
of
the
first
cross
greatly
resemble
in
general
look
the
ainu
parent
without
being
quite
as
hairy
though
still
very
hairy
but
a
strange
peculiarity
is
that
they
get
bald
while
quite
young
one
can
easily
detect
them
by
their
eyes
which
are
frequently
like
those
of
the
japanese
by
the
wide
flat
forehead
and
by
the
pose
of
the
head
which
inclines
forward
they
generally
walk
with
their
toes
turned
in
instead
of
keeping
their
feet
perfectly
straight
like
the
pure
ainu
the
moral
and
intellectual
position
of
these
is
a
pitiful
one
they
are
rejected
by
both
the
ainu
and
japanese
and
are
held
inferior
to
both
alike
a
high
moral
standard
whether
got
from
philosophic
breadth
or
christian
virtues
does
not
suit
a
despised
barbarian
race
like
the
ainu
nothing
could
or
does
kill
them
quicker
than
civilisation
experiments
have
been
tried
to
civilise
certain
ainu
they
were
made
to
wash
bathe
and
live
in
comfortable
clean
quarters
they
were
instructed
and
got
good
food
but
after
a
few
months
they
had
to
be
sent
back
to
their
native
place
and
ways
for
civilisation
only
killed
them
the
have
none
of
the
good
qualities
of
either
race
they
are
neither
as
brave
as
the
ainu
nor
courteous
and
like
the
japanese
the
following
remarks
which
i
take
direct
from
my
diary
were
written
by
me
between
shimokebo
and
tomakomai
on
the
coast
of
yezo
where
many
are
found
along
the
and
i
shall
pass
them
on
untouched
to
my
readers
the
ainu
along
this
coast
were
decidedly
ugly
many
are
also
found
along
this
coast
these
invariably
grow
bald
in
early
life
whereas
the
ainu
do
not
the
hair
on
their
back
arms
and
legs
is
not
so
long
or
so
thick
as
with
the
pure
ainu
their
teeth
are
neither
so
strong
nor
so
sound
as
is
usually
the
case
when
a
mixture
of
two
or
more
races
takes
place
the
lower
and
upper
jaws
not
being
of
the
right
proportion
it
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
that
unusual
pressure
and
friction
injure
and
wear
out
the
enamel
of
the
teeth
thus
causing
premature
decay
the
americans
and
australians
are
good
examples
of
this
premature
decay
caused
by
the
disproportion
of
the
upper
and
lower
jaws
also
teeth
which
do
not
fit
well
together
sometimes
grow
so
long
as
to
be
a
nuisance
to
the
person
who
owns
them
i
found
that
these
have
all
the
bad
qualities
of
both
the
ainu
and
the
japanese
and
have
not
retained
any
of
the
good
ones
they
are
lazy
and
vindictive
it
is
well
to
mention
that
on
the
japanese
side
they
have
come
mostly
from
the
criminals
exported
by
the
japanese
government
which
fact
partly
explains
why
they
are
so
and
untrustworthy
instead
of
falling
into
the
more
civilised
ways
of
the
japanese
these
prefer
the
wild
life
of
their
ainu
ancestors
and
if
anything
they
are
wilder
than
the
ainu
themselves
insanity
is
very
common
among
the
head
is
in
most
instances
of
an
abnormal
size
the
frontal
bone
is
generally
more
sloping
than
with
the
thoroughbred
ainu
and
though
the
skull
be
wide
from
one
temple
to
the
other
it
is
not
spacious
enough
from
the
frontal
bone
to
the
back
of
the
head
they
have
heads
so
shaped
that
the
animal
propensities
are
in
excess
of
the
moral
and
mental
faculties
in
thoroughbred
ainu
i
found
the
bumps
of
amativeness
philoprogenitiveness
and
tune
very
well
developed
in
the
these
bumps
hardly
show
at
all
and
in
some
cases
the
back
of
the
head
where
the
two
first
bumps
are
found
is
almost
flat
ainu
never
live
to
be
very
old
they
are
often
affected
with
rheumatism
a
disease
peculiar
to
the
far
east
leprosy
and
consumption
and
they
suffer
from
these
diseases
much
more
than
do
the
pure
ainu
i
found
leprosy
quite
common
among
while
i
have
seen
but
few
ainu
affected
with
it
in
most
instances
though
leprosy
had
only
attained
its
first
stages
contraction
of
fingers
and
subsequent
dropping
off
of
the
three
phalanges
ears
and
nose
but
this
may
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
the
sufferers
in
general
succumb
before
the
disease
attains
its
more
serious
character
when
the
whole
body
is
visibly
affected
by
it
precise
laws
as
to
the
degree
of
quickness
of
perception
power
of
reasoning
and
learning
of
the
ainu
race
can
not
be
given
for
as
i
have
mentioned
before
almost
each
individual
would
require
a
special
rule
for
himself
my
readers
may
have
noticed
that
while
some
ainu
were
but
little
above
monkeys
others
were
sharp
and
gave
answers
very
much
to
the
point
this
may
apparently
be
regarded
as
a
contradiction
on
my
part
by
people
who
have
neither
lived
with
savages
nor
studied
the
temperament
of
beasts
but
it
is
not
a
contradiction
there
are
in
this
world
clever
monkeys
and
stupid
monkeys
some
can
never
be
made
to
learn
any
tricks
others
will
learn
them
in
no
time
intelligence
is
instinctive
and
not
acquired
though
of
course
it
can
be
greatly
developed
with
education
thus
the
ainu
are
instinctively
intelligent
but
i
wish
my
readers
clearly
to
understand
that
their
intelligence
does
not
go
much
further
than
that
of
an
intelligent
monkey
though
of
course
the
ainu
have
the
advantage
over
beasts
of
being
able
to
talk
and
therefore
to
a
limited
extent
discuss
and
combine
the
ainu
memory
is
a
perfect
blank
in
certain
respects
as
with
arithmetic
science
mechanics
reading
writing
drawing
and
delineating
maps
while
in
other
directions
it
seems
to
be
fairly
keen
as
in
hunting
fishing
tracking
and
acquiring
languages
up
to
a
certain
point
this
last
faculty
is
noticeable
in
nearly
all
the
lowest
races
as
the
australian
aborigines
the
tasmanian
natives
now
extinct
the
tierra
del
fuegians
the
ainu
ideas
of
time
are
vague
and
if
you
add
to
that
the
extreme
difficulty
which
they
experience
in
counting
even
up
to
ten
and
their
inability
to
count
beyond
that
number
it
is
easy
to
understand
why
we
can
never
learn
the
exact
age
of
ainu
individuals
like
the
monkeys
the
ainu
can
not
concentrate
their
attention
and
they
are
easily
wearied
beads
and
shiny
objects
have
a
fascination
for
them
but
other
objects
even
perfectly
new
to
them
arouse
but
little
curiosity
which
soon
passes
and
they
show
no
intelligence
and
less
imagination
as
to
the
probable
use
of
these
strange
objects
they
show
no
inquisitiveness
and
no
wish
to
be
taught
the
use
of
anything
new
and
unfamiliar
it
will
be
remembered
that
at
yamakubiro
on
the
tokachi
river
beyond
the
natural
astonishment
caused
by
the
first
appearance
of
my
ponies
the
strange
baggage
and
myself
the
ainu
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
this
novel
sight
and
did
not
show
any
wish
to
have
it
explained
while
more
civilised
people
like
the
japanese
would
not
have
been
satisfied
until
i
had
shown
and
explained
every
article
in
my
possession
and
allowed
each
person
to
try
its
use
after
which
they
would
talk
for
hours
of
what
they
had
seen
the
ainu
are
not
built
so
and
therefore
they
have
never
made
any
progress
in
the
more
civilised
parts
of
yezo
we
have
a
proof
of
it
their
backwardness
in
acquiring
the
habits
and
customs
of
their
conquerors
the
japanese
arises
from
incapacity
more
than
from
conservatism
yet
for
all
that
the
ainu
are
so
incapable
of
improving
themselves
they
are
very
persevering
in
what
they
do
attempt
as
in
their
rough
wooden
carvings
the
hollowing
of
their
the
construction
of
their
wooden
tools
and
weapons
the
weaving
of
their
rough
garments
and
the
ornamentation
thereof
but
in
all
these
they
appear
to
act
more
automatically
than
with
keen
and
constructive
intelligence
the
ainu
are
not
to
be
taken
pied
de
la
for
the
illusions
produced
by
ignorance
and
untutored
imagination
prevent
anything
like
literal
accuracy
but
they
are
not
what
we
may
call
conscious
and
immoral
liars
a
good
example
of
this
is
my
adventure
at
horobets
when
although
they
knew
that
they
would
be
severely
punished
by
the
japanese
policeman
the
ainu
confessed
their
attack
on
me
and
did
not
attempt
either
denial
or
evasion
they
are
often
plucky
and
even
distinctly
courageous
as
when
out
a
man
armed
only
with
a
large
and
not
over
sharp
knife
unhesitatingly
attacks
this
formidable
beast
who
sits
up
on
his
hind
quarters
sure
to
crush
the
life
out
of
his
assailant
should
he
miss
his
stroke
the
ainu
protecting
his
head
with
his
left
arm
and
having
taken
the
precaution
to
cover
his
back
with
skins
goes
merrily
for
the
embrace
and
while
bruin
squeezes
the
hairy
man
splits
its
body
open
with
the
large
knife
the
ainu
are
they
are
not
subject
to
strong
emotions
and
therefore
they
are
not
much
affected
by
dreams
and
nightmares
they
are
not
affectionate
except
for
a
momentary
impulse
but
like
most
animals
they
are
faithful
when
they
love
mothers
are
fond
of
their
children
till
they
have
reached
puberty
but
after
that
the
affection
seems
to
fade
away
paternal
love
is
much
less
strong
the
pure
ainu
are
comparatively
honest
people
which
may
be
due
to
the
incapacity
for
being
dishonest
in
a
country
where
there
is
no
exact
definition
of
property
where
anybody
can
get
what
he
requires
without
resorting
to
theft
there
is
no
reason
why
everybody
should
not
be
honest
then
according
to
ainu
ideas
stealing
is
not
always
stealing
for
instance
if
an
ainu
without
asking
takes
away
some
of
the
salmon
caught
by
one
of
his
hairy
brethren
he
will
be
blamed
for
it
he
will
get
into
a
row
and
probably
be
beaten
but
if
the
theft
is
perpetrated
on
a
japanese
or
a
stranger
he
will
be
praised
though
the
ainu
well
knows
that
he
is
not
acting
right
their
desire
is
stronger
than
their
conscience
such
as
it
is
and
having
no
laws
of
their
own
to
rule
them
worth
speaking
of
they
often
do
according
to
their
desire
without
deserving
the
accusation
of
conscious
dishonesty
it
is
exactly
the
same
case
as
when
a
dog
jumps
on
the
when
everybody
is
absent
and
carries
off
the
leg
of
mutton
which
he
knows
he
ought
not
to
touch
but
the
temptation
was
too
strong
and
he
could
not
resist
it
the
ainu
are
fond
of
independence
though
in
many
instances
i
found
them
gentle
and
apparently
submissive
to
a
stronger
will
than
their
own
the
field
of
their
is
of
course
very
narrow
and
the
same
rough
rude
primitive
thoughts
and
ideas
are
constantly
repeated
in
their
conversation
as
well
as
in
their
designs

physiological
observations
and

exposure
odour
of
the
ainu
the
five
senses
the
following
physiological
remarks
are
mostly
from
observations
made
on
ainu
of
the
upper
tokachi
district
the
natives
of
which
have
had
no
communication
with
europeans
and
little
with
japanese
previous
to
my
own
visit
to
them
observations
made
on
the
ainu
of
volcano
bay
and
piratori
on
those
of
the
and
west
coasts
and
the
ishikari
river
as
well
as
on
of
different
districts
have
been
taken
into
consideration
owing
to
the
lack
of
a
clinical
thermometer
and
other
instruments
i
unfortunately
was
not
able
to
ascertain
the
normal
temperature
of
the
body
nor
could
i
get
any
very
accurate
observations
as
to
the
frequency
of
the
owing
to
the
miserable
condition
of
my
watch
and
the
difficult
task
of
getting
natives
to
sit
perfectly
still
while
their
pulse
was
felt
a
superstitious
fear
too
that
some
evil
would
befall
them
accelerated
the
pulsations
and
they
invariably
moved
away
rubbing
the
spot
i
had
touched
on
their
wrist
though
i
could
not
count
the
exact
number
of
pulsations
to
a
minute
the
movement
of
the
pulse
was
as
a
rule
slow
and
rather
weak
respirations
were
fourteen
to
seventeen
to
a
minute
in
men
and
about
sixteen
to
twenty
in
women
and
the
respiratory
movements
were
similar
in
both
sexes
costal
breathing
was
predominant
in
i
have
sometimes
noticed
abdominal
breathing
the
ainu
not
only
bear
cold
well
but
prefer
it
to
heat
though
indeed
their
country
is
never
very
hot
the
sun
rays
have
no
fascination
for
them
as
with
so
many
other
races
and
i
have
seldom
seen
ainu
basking
in
the
sun
for
purely
physical
pleasure
although
they
go
about
with
uncovered
heads
and
do
not
seem
to
suffer
any
ill
effects
from
the
practice
the
ainu
of
piratori
wear
japanese
hats
of
and
others
especially
women
tie
round
their
head
a
japanese
towel
a
fashion
as
we
have
seen
also
adopted
from
the
japanese
with
this
the
crown
of
the
head
is
left
uncovered
the
ainu
are
not
massively
formed
but
they
are
sturdy
and
as
we
have
seen
can
bear
almost
any
amount
of
privation
as
regards
food
and
drink
sleep
is
necessary
to
them
and
they
require
a
great
deal
to
be
in
anything
like
good
condition
the
sleeping
hours
are
generally
from
an
hour
or
so
after
sunset
to
sunrise
but
during
the
day
they
are
often
drowsy
and
turn
in
to
have
a
siesta
after
food
and
exercise
in
men
the
voice
is
soft
and
deep
shriller
but
still
gentle
in
women
the
ainu
seldom
perspire
partly
because
the
pores
of
their
skin
are
blocked
with
dirt
partly
because
their
long
hair
absorbs
a
great
quantity
of
natural
moisture
and
mostly
because
they
do
not
drink
much
except
when
they
can
get
hold
of
intoxicants
the
skin
is
greasy
the
natural
result
of
many
years
of
an
unwashed
existence
and
this
gives
to
the
hairy
people
a
peculiar
and
strong
odour
much
resembling
that
of
monkeys
many
are
familiar
with
the
peculiar
odour
of
an
uncleaned
monkey
cage
and
the
same
intensified
a
thousand
times
characterises
an
ainu
village
hundreds
of
yards
off
you
can
distinctly
smell
out
a
village
or
if
the
wind
is
blowing
towards
you
that
peculiar
odour
is
perceptible
for
a
full
although
the
sense
of
smell
is
acute
in
the
ainu
for
they
sometimes
employ
it
in
tracking
animals
they
are
not
aware
of
their
own
strong
odour
but
they
are
quick
in
distinguishing
that
of
other
races
i
have
several
times
heard
ainu
of
the
coast
remark
that
i
possessed
a
different
odour
from
that
of
the
japanese
but
they
could
neither
define
it
nor
assimilate
it
to
that
of
any
animal
they
knew
though
several
of
them
one
day
held
a
lengthy
about
it
and
in
the
interest
of
anthropology
i
submitted
to
the
unpleasant
process
of
being
smelt
all
over
by
them
the
chinese
unanimously
assert
that
europeans
smell
like
sheep
and
they
say
this
is
the
reason
we
constantly
wash
and
bathe
being
aware
of
our
infirmity
and
doing
our
best
to
diminish
it
by
soap
and
water
we
ourselves
attribute
to
jews
one
distinct
odour
and
yet
another
to
the
russians
not
to
speak
of
those
belonging
to
the
negroes
the
chinese
and
in
fact
all
other
nations
thus
the
odour
has
some
importance
in
the
classification
of
peoples
as
it
largely
depends
on
the
kind
of
food
as
well
as
the
personal
habits
of
a
race
smell
differently
from
and
these
again
from
vegetarians
as
regards
the
ainu
their
filthy
habits
of
course
increase
their
offensiveness
while
bodily
exercise
renders
them
intolerable
the
japanese
recognise
the
ainu
odour
as
a
distinguishing
mark
of
the
race
and
japanese
fishermen
have
often
said
to
me
shto
taihen
or
else
onaji
ainu
men
smell
bad
just
like
a
monkey
or
a
bear
as
an
ainu
grows
older
this
peculiarity
increases
the
weaker
sex
is
generally
more
strongly
scented
than
are
the
men
owing
to
the
fact
that
women
wear
skins
and
rough
cloth
rags
nearly
all
the
year
round
while
in
summer
the
men
go
about
either
entirely
naked
or
very
lightly
clad
on
the
coast
of
yezo
and
in
shikotan
kurile
islands
i
saw
some
ainu
who
contrary
to
the
rule
had
red
hair
and
their
animal
odour
was
terribly
offensive
the
ainu
do
not
use
any
unguents
like
or
the
like
by
which
the
unpleasantness
of
certain
african
tribes
and
eastern
peoples
is
to
be
accounted
for
what
they
have
is
natural
and
national
and
due
to
their
food
habits
and
race
alone
the
ainu
have
no
partiality
or
dislike
for
any
particular
scents
and
their
sense
of
smell
shows
itself
mainly
in
their
power
of
tracking
game
or
animals
as
was
said
before
the
same
might
be
said
of
the
sense
of
touch
which
they
seldom
apply
practically
notwithstanding
their
sensitiveness
in
certain
parts
of
the
body
especially
under
the
and
on
each
side
of
the
spinal
column
and
the
back
of
the
head
just
those
parts
which
in
most
animals
are
the
most
sensitive
but
they
have
no
developed
sense
of
touch
in
their
as
with
civilised
nations
most
ainu
find
it
difficult
to
declare
which
is
the
heavier
of
two
not
very
unequal
weights
differences
in
the
temperature
of
two
bodies
and
in
the
smoothness
or
texture
of
two
surfaces
are
also
extremely
difficult
for
them
to
define
while
it
is
easy
for
them
to
judge
of
weights
and
texture
by
eyesight
the
palms
of
the
hands
which
are
so
sensitive
with
us
owing
to
the
papillæ
being
more
thickly
studded
there
than
in
other
parts
of
the
body
are
less
intelligently
sensitive
with
the
ainu
when
they
touch
cold
or
hot
objects
they
feel
pain
but
not
difference
of
temperature
as
when
with
us
a
wound
is
touched
it
makes
little
difference
whether
it
is
by
something
hot
or
cold
it
is
simply
pain
and
not
discrimination
their
lips
as
well
as
the
tip
of
the
tongue
are
slightly
more
sensitive
the
lower
lip
more
so
than
the
upper
i
was
never
able
to
determine
the
relative
sensibility
of
the
sensitive
parts
of
the
ainu
body
as
my
experiments
either
caused
anger
and
impatience
or
hilarity
and
mockery
if
the
first
the
observations
had
to
be
stopped
before
they
were
well
begun
if
the
second
beyond
the
general
results
which
i
have
quoted
the
answers
were
mere
guesswork
on
their
part
and
therefore
not
worth
recording
most
of
my
observations
are
based
on
experiments
made
while
the
men
were
unaware
that
they
were
observed
at
all
often
when
asleep
i
have
touched
them
on
the
soles
of
the
feet
and
the
palms
of
the
hands
without
causing
them
to
awake
while
when
touched
on
the
lower
lip
or
in
the
lumbar
region
they
invariably
woke
up
startled
one
day
i
tried
this
experiment
on
an
ainu
who
was
sleeping
on
his
back
with
his
mouth
wide
open
i
touched
his
tongue
with
a
and
the
effect
was
subitaneous
more
so
than
on
either
the
lips
or
the
lumbar
region
the
skin
directly
over
the
spine
was
dull
but
the
ears
showed
a
certain
amount
of
sensibility
the
sense
of
taste
which
is
a
mere
modification
of
the
sense
of
touch
is
also
dull
although
naturally
when
stimulated
by
very
acid
or
bitter
substances
it
produced
distinct
impressions
even
with
ourselves
though
more
perfected
than
the
sense
of
smell
which
however
often
comes
to
its
assistance
few
can
boast
of
having
the
sense
of
taste
very
acute
in
our
lower
classes
an
extraordinary
amount
of
salt
mustard
pepper
or
sugar
is
needed
before
they
can
call
their
food
tasty
whereas
a
person
of
more
refined
education
will
detect
the
lack
or
excess
of
even
the
smallest
portion
of
the
lingual
nerves
and
extremes
of
heat
or
cold
deaden
the
sensibility
of
the
tongue
palate
and
fauces
and
destroy
the
power
of
distinguishing
flavours
bad
digestion
also
frequently
affects
the
organs
of
taste
from
this
we
may
argue
then
that
the
sense
of
taste
though
born
in
one
has
to
be
cultivated
before
it
is
brought
to
any
degree
of
refinement
the
ainu
not
only
do
not
possess
this
acquired
refinement
but
through
monotony
of
food
learn
only
one
kind
of
flavour
and
can
not
distinguish
differences
thus
as
many
labourers
in
our
country
would
not
find
any
difference
between
a
slightly
underdone
and
one
so
an
ainu
finds
no
difference
whatever
between
a
piece
of
salmon
properly
dried
and
one
perfectly
rotten
in
this
respect
the
ainu
are
far
below
beasts
in
tribes
of
natives
like
the
ainu
who
have
lived
an
adventurous
life
mostly
in
the
open
air
it
is
but
natural
that
the
two
senses
of
sight
and
hearing
should
be
more
developed
than
those
of
touch
smell
and
taste
as
life
itself
depends
mostly
on
their
accuracy
and
acuteness
the
ainu
possess
good
sight
inflammation
of
the
eyes
is
very
common
among
their
children
owing
to
their
filthy
condition
but
it
seldom
affects
their
permanent
sight
very
few
ainu
suffer
either
from
myopy
or
cataract
or
other
eye
affections
such
as
are
frequent
among
civilised
and
more
studious
nations
in
very
warm
climates
where
the
sun
is
powerful
and
the
light
strong
the
eyes
are
generally
shielded
by
specially
long
and
thick
eyelashes
and
eyebrows
which
last
prevent
the
sweat
from
running
down
the
forehead
into
the
orbit
but
strange
to
say
the
ainu
who
are
a
northern
race
and
have
always
lived
in
cold
climates
have
eyelashes
even
longer
and
thicker
than
any
race
of
people
in
tropical
climates
the
iris
is
of
a
somewhat
greyish
tint
sometimes
traversed
with
brown
shades
the
white
of
the
eye
is
less
pearly
than
with
caucasian
races
and
the
eyes
shaded
as
they
are
by
long
eyelashes
and
heavy
eyelids
seem
to
possess
all
the
qualities
necessary
for
abnormally
long
vision
and
this
we
find
to
be
the
case
for
the
ainu
can
distinguish
objects
a
long
way
off
but
they
are
dense
as
to
minutiæ
in
other
words
the
eye
of
an
ainu
is
ready
to
receive
an
impression
but
very
slow
in
transmitting
to
the
brain
the
impression
received
as
we
have
seen
they
can
not
reproduce
the
human
form
divine
or
any
faithful
representation
of
anything
animate
or
inanimate
which
they
have
seen
they
see
thus
should
an
ainu
attention
be
drawn
to
some
very
distant
object
rapidly
moving
on
the
shore
he
will
at
once
say
that
it
is
a
horse
because
he
knows
that
the
chances
are
it
is
a
horse
but
he
will
be
unable
to
describe
its
colour
and
whether
cantering
or
galloping
saddled
or
unsaddled
by
a
single
glance
at
the
horse
unless
his
attention
is
called
to
each
particular
detail
when
he
will
answer
each
question
correctly
enough
the
ainu
vision
is
then
strong
but
the
brain
is
not
quick
in
response
testing
their
sight
by
test
dots
as
used
in
the
british
army
was
not
a
success
greatly
owing
to
their
inability
to
count
and
the
inaccuracy
of
their
answers
the
most
sense
in
the
hairy
people
is
in
my
opinion
that
of
hearing
distant
sounds
are
clearly
recognised
and
specified
and
they
are
also
aware
that
by
placing
one
ear
near
the
ground
sounds
of
horse
hoofs
and
the
like
can
be
clearly
distinguished
the
ticking
of
a
waterbury
watch
could
be
heard
by
ainu
at
a
distance
of
twenty
and
feet
while
i
could
only
hear
it
nineteen
feet
away
i
was
often
struck
by
the
quickness
with
which
they
detected
the
even
when
the
watch
was
in
my
pocket
and
they
were
six
or
eight
feet
away
the
unusual
sound
fixed
their
attention
and
made
them
curious
as
to
the
cause
and
they
showed
a
childish
kind
of
surprise
and
delight
when
the
watch
was
produced
and
passed
round
among
them
each
one
being
allowed
to
enjoy
his
share
of
the
ticking
resuming
these
few
remarks
on
the
characteristic
points
of
ainu
senses
my
readers
will
probably
have
noticed
certain
facts
which
strongly
support
darwin
theory
of
evolution
and
the

arboreal
ancestor

pointed
ears

which
the
races
of
men
are
descended

chapter
xxviii
the
ainu
superstitions
morals
laws
and
punishments
i
can
not
begin
this
chapter
better
than
by
saying
that
ainu
religious
ideas
are
essentially
chaotic
they
recognise
no
supreme
god
and
no
intelligent
creator
and
they
can
not
be
called
polytheists
for
indeed
they
are
not
of
any
power
taking
the
word
in
its
full
meaning
the
ainu
worship
nothing
if
they
have
any
belief
at
all
it
is
an
imperfect
kind
of
totemism
and
the
central
point
of
that
belief
is
their
own
descent
from
the
bear
this
does
not
include
the
smallest
reverence
for
their
ancestor
they
capture
their
totem
and
keep
it
in
captivity
they
speak
to
it
and
feed
it
but
no
prayers
are
offered
to
it
when
the
bear
is
fat
it
is
taken
out
of
the
cage
to
be
and
baited
by
all
the
men
present
it
is
tied
to
a
stake
and
a
pole
is
thrust
into
its
mouth
and
when
the
poor
beast
has
been
sufficiently
tortured
pricked
with
pointed
sticks
shot
at
with
blunted
arrows
bruised
with
stones
maddened
with
rage
and
it
is
killed
outright
and
ancestor
as
it
may
be
it
makes
the
chief
dish
and
of
a
festival
where
all
the
members
of
the
tribe
partake
of
its
flesh
the
owner
of
the
hut
in
which
the
feast
takes
place
then
sticks
the
skull
on
to
a
forked
pole
and
sets
it
outside
with
the
others
at
the
east
end
of
his
hut
the
skin
is
made
into
garments
or
is
spread
on
the
ground
to
sleep
on
in
addition
to
this
rudimentary
kind
of
totemism
if
i
may
call
it
so
the
ainu
show
a
certain
amount
of
fear
and
respect
for
anything
which
supports
their
life
or
can
destroy
it
this
however
is
under
the
form
of
an
instinct
rather
than
a
religious
feeling
dumb
animals
of
any
kind
are
similarly
affected
by
powers
which
they
can
not
explain
but
as
we
would
not
think
for
a
moment
that
when
a
dog
is
barking
at
the
moon
the
dog
is
worshipping
the
orb
of
night
or
when
it
basks
in
the
sun
that
it
is
offering
prayers
and
reverence
to
the
orb
of
day
no
more
should
we
think
that
the
ainu
who
are
not
much
above
dumb
animals
worship
all
they
respect
and
fear
if
other
writers
most
of
whom
have
never
visited
the
ainu
country
had
not
written
on
this
subject
i
would
have
limited
myself
to
saying
that
the
ainu
properly
speaking
have
no
religion
but
as
certain
untenable
theories
and
false
ideas
have
been
published
i
feel
bound
to
state
what
i
know
on
the
subject
that
so
far
as
i
can
i
may
correct
these
erroneous
impressions
i
regard
myself
as
qualified
to
speak
with
some
authority
as
i
am
the
foreigner
who
has
seen
and
studied
the
different
tribes
of
ainu
in
yezo
and
the
kuriles
while
other
writers
the
few
who
have
actually
been
there
have
based
their
statements
on
a
few
or
ainu
in
the
more
civilised
part
of
southern
yezo
collecting
from
them
ideas
left
behind
by
previous
travellers
and
offering
them
to
the
public
as
purely
ainu
that
these
hasty
travellers
and
cursory
writers
have
been
deceived
or
have
deceived
themselves
is
not
astonishing
for
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
ainu
language
is
as
poor
in
words
as
the
ainu
brain
is
deficient
in
thoughts
thus
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
explain
to
an
ainu
what
is
meant
by
religion
by
divinities
and
by
worship
the
nearest
approach
can
be
made
only
by
comparisons
and
analogies
which
often
lead
far
from
the
point
aimed
at
like
all
savages
and
barbarians
the
ainu
are
more
apt
to
answer
as
they
think
will
please
the
questioner
than
to
give
a
definition
of
their
own
beliefs
the
manner
in
which
a
question
is
put
gives
the
keynote
to
the
reply
which
is
in
no
sense
an
independent
statement
of
their
own
thoughts
for
instance
if
you
were
to
say
to
an
ainu
you
are
old
are
you
not
he
would
answer
yes
but
if
you
asked
the
same
man
you
are
not
old
are
you
he
would
equally
answer
yes
knowingly
speaking
the
truth
is
not
one
of
their
characteristics
indeed
they
do
not
know
the
difference
between
falsehood
and
truth
this
is
a
common
failing
with
all
savages
as
well
as
with
all
orientals
but
with
the
ainu
it
is
even
more
accentuated
and
when
in
addition
to
this
the
difficulty
of
making
them
understand
exactly
what
one
means
is
taken
into
consideration
it
is
not
astonishing
that
a
traveller
arrives
at
a
wrong
conclusion
if
the
utmost
pains
be
not
taken
in
pursuing
investigations
of
course
the
ainu
who
have
come
in
contact
with
japanese
know
of
a
god
and
some
of
them
at
the
instigation
of
japanese
have
become
nominal
buddhists
benry
at
piratori
showed
me
a
small
buddhist
shrine
of
japanese
manufacture
which
had
been
put
up
on
a
neighbouring
hill
all
the
time
i
stayed
at
piratori
i
never
observed
any
ainu
worship
at
it
one
day
i
saw
two
boys
throwing
stones
at
it
but
that
could
hardly
be
called
an
act
of
reverence
even
among
my
hairy
friends
on
my
inquiring
as
to
the
origin
and
use
of
the
shrine
i
was
told
by
some
that
it
was
erected
to
the
god
of
the
japanese
benry
who
was
always
well
informed
both
in
things
that
he
knew
and
those
that
he
did
not
know
said
that
it
was
built
in
honour
of
yoshitsune
the
japanese
personage
who
as
we
have
seen
is
the
hero
in
legends
and
whose
image
or
spirit
according
to
travellers
tales
is
worshipped
by
the
ainu
it
always
appeared
strange
to
me
that
the
piratori
ainu
had
this
japanese
hero
in
their
legends
but
still
more
strange
that
they
should
make
him
their
deity
yet
what
was
most
singular
of
all
was
that
with
the
exception
of
benry
and
a
few
others
at
piratori
no
other
ainu
i
met
in
any
other
part
of
yezo
seemed
to
know
about
yoshitsune
or
okikurumi
as
he
is
sometimes
called
by
them
and
moreover
they
knew
nothing
of
his
doings
or
of
the
reason
of
his
being
worshipped
the
ainu
of
the
tokachi
knew
nothing
whatever
of
this
personage
the
ainu
idea
of
soul
is
always
associated
with
breath
or
life
and
as
for
the
resurrection
of
the
body
and
the
future
life
of
the
soul
they
have
never
even
dreamt
of
it
metempsychosis
is
equally
unknown
to
them
as
my
readers
have
seen
in
the
description
of
a
burial
the
implements
and
weapons
which
belonged
to
a
deceased
person
are
buried
with
him
the
articles
however
previous
to
being
thrown
into
the
grave
are
smashed
to
pieces
for
the
idea
is
not
that
the
dead
body
should
profit
by
these
things
in
the
other
world
but
that
no
other
person
should
make
use
of
what
had
been
his
property
in
this
the
reasoning
power
of
the
ainu
does
not
carry
him
beyond
what
is
purely
material
his
mind
has
never
been
trained
to
go
beyond
that
limit
and
he
finds
that
he
can
live
well
within
it
like
all
animals
he
is
guided
by
his
instinct
which
tells
him
what
is
good
and
what
is
bad
for
him
but
as
to
any
attempt
to
find
out
such
things
are
good
or
bad
for
him
he
is
utterly
at
a
loss
and
has
to
give
up
the
quest
though
not
devoid
of
a
rudimentary
kind
of
shrewdness
the
ainu
is
dense
and
ignorant
to
the
last
degree
and
just
as
he
is
reluctant
to
adopt
new
modes
of
living
so
he
is
unable
to
accept
new
ideas
or
larger
thoughts
the
mere
conception
of
a
superior
being
who
is
the
maker
of
all
things
and
above
all
things
is
far
beyond
the
comprehension
of
any
ainu
eating
and
drinking
are
what
he
principally
lives
for
he
does
not
thirst
for
knowledge
nor
strive
after
the
divine
and
he
has
no
creed
of
any
kind
and
no
formula
of
sacrifice
or
worship
which
two
conditions
are
essential
to
even
the
most
elementary
religion
what
the
ainu
do
really
possess
in
the
way
of
supernaturalism
is
the
ordinary
savage
credulous
superstition
which
manifests
itself
in
certain
charms
or
fear
of
certain
omens
however
after
that
degree
they
take
the
world
as
it
comes
they
have
no
idea
of
who
made
it
and
they
are
not
anxious
to
learn
the
sun
the
moon
bears
salmon
water
fire
mountains
trees
are
all
things
for
which
an
ainu
has
a
dumb
kind
of
regard
not
amounting
to
reverence
as
he
knows
that
he
could
not
live
without
them
this
has
led
some
persons
to
define
these
objects
as
the
principal
divinities
of
the
ainu
and
to
call
the
people
themselves
polytheists
the
word
or
has
been
rendered
as
god
gods
divinity
now
what
does
the
word
or
really
mean
translated
literally
it
means
old
or
ancient
but
amongst
a
hundred
other
meanings
it
also
denotes
large
beautiful
strange
it
the
man
he
who
in
fact
it
is
used
to
qualify
anything
whether
good
or
bad
and
in
some
ways
corresponds
to
our
adjectives
wonderful
awful
grand
but
assuredly
the
ainu
do
not
by
this
word
mean
to
designate
the
objects
thus
described
as
so
many
gods
anything
for
which
they
entertain
respect
or
fear
is
described
as
or
which
thus
is
applied
to
the
sun
the
moon
the
stars
mountains
rivers
old
trees
bears
salmon
large
stones
not
with
the
intention
of
making
them
divinities
but
simply
to
specify
their
power
greatness
or
antiquity
the
word
is
applied
to
every
kind
of
thing
animate
or
inanimate
good
or
bad
respected
or
derided
dreaded
or
revered
admired
or
abhorred
it
is
sometimes
a
prefix
sometimes
an
affix
and
is
the
most
universal
attribute
the
ainu
world
or
language
contains
we
are
therefore
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
either
the
ainu
are
polytheists
or
pantheists
to
such
an
extent
as
occasionally
to
make
everything
and
everybody
a
god
or
else
that
translators
have
given
their
own
and
a
greatly
exaggerated
meaning
to
the
word
and
that
these
gods
are
not
gods
at
all
to
me
there
is
no
alternative
opinion
on
the
matter
the
ainu
have
no
gods
in
our
sense
basing
conclusions
on
wrong
premises
writers
on
the
ainu
religion
have
been
naturally
led
astray
altogether
for
instance
the
composite
word
which
a
learned
missionary
has
translated
creator
only
means
the
man
who
made
the
village
a
description
which
hardly
corresponds
to
the
grandeur
attributed
to
the
words
by
its
imaginative
translator
village
place
site
to
make
build
the
man
ancient
strength
then
again
which
according
to
some
means
the
home
of
god
in
its
real
signification
is
an
ancient
village
a
beautiful
place
when
is
applied
to
persons
it
is
generally
a
suffix
when
to
things
it
is
a
prefix
but
let
us
come
to
the
which
by
some
have
been
called
the
ainu
gods
by
others
divine
symbols
these
are
with
shavings
depending
from
the
upper
end
sometimes
from
the
middle
and
occasionally
from
near
the
lower
end
as
well
the
larger
wands
are
about
four
feet
in
length
and
have
either
one
or
two
bunches
of
shavings
at
the
upper
end
only
they
go
by
the
name
of
or
big
other
smaller
like
the
are
kept
in
the
house
and
stuck
in
the
eastern
corner
of
the
hearth
and
in
the
wall
directly
opposite
the
entrance
door
some
of
the
are
shaved
upwards
from
the
bottom
others
downwards
from
the
top
and
one
a
big
is
often
thrust
through
the
small
window
facing
the
east
sometimes
they
are
placed
about
singly
especially
inside
the
huts
but
outside
close
to
the
eastern
wall
i
have
often
seen
eight
or
ten
standing
together
in
a
row
when
so
taken
collectively
they
are
called
on
volcano
bay
up
the
saru
river
and
on
the
lake
kutcharo
where
it
is
the
custom
of
the
ainu
to
make
trophies
of
the
skulls
of
bears
and
deer
which
have
been
killed
in
the
hunt
one
or
two
are
placed
at
the
foot
of
the
trophy
sometimes
but
very
rarely
a
whole
is
to
be
seen
in
front
of
a
trophy
but
in
most
cases
the
i
saw
were
near
huts
that
had
no
trophy
at
all
and
as
i
say
only
very
seldom
were
they
in
front
of
the
trophy
itself
unless
a
bear
feast
was
going
on
i
am
therefore
under
the
impression
that
these
are
only
put
up
when
some
festival
takes
place
and
that
they
are
not
kept
there
permanently
i
remember
that
at
piratori
there
were
no
and
no
outside
house
but
on
the
day
that
the
festival
took
place
one
was
put
up
and
several
were
placed
inside
the
hut
in
the
hearth
and
on
the
north
wall
likewise
a
was
put
up
on
the
same
day
at
the
east
end
of
the
hut
in
which
the
feast
was
given
and
the
inside
was
also
adorned
with
of
various
sizes
and
descriptions
each
is
pointed
at
the
lower
end
so
as
to
be
easily
stuck
in
the
ground
the
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
impressed
me
as
being
mostly
for
ornament
then
some
are
held
as
charms
against
misfortune
and
disease
but
they
never
impressed
me
as
being
offerings
to
the
gods
are
placed
near
springs
so
that
the
good
water
may
not
turn
into
pestilential
and
occasionally
of
a
peculiar
shape
are
hung
in
the
doorway
of
huts
they
are
made
of
a
number
of
small
willow
sticks
tied
together
from
which
hang
five
or
six
bunches
of
shavings
they
are
hung
horizontally
and
not
in
a
vertical
position
like
the
other
they
are
very
uncommon
and
only
used
on
certain
specified
occasions
for
example
when
a
child
is
born
an
in
the
shape
of
a
doll
is
made
of
a
bunch
of
reeds
folded
double
and
tied
with
a
string
about
an
inch
from
the
bend
which
thus
forms
the
head
it
is
then
tied
lower
down
to
indicate
the
waist
by
dividing
the
reeds
into
two
equal
portions
they
produce
a
pair
of
legs
and
a
stick
is
then
passed
through
the
reeds
between
the
head
and
the
waist
to
form
the
arms
when
this
doll
is
made
it
is
placed
near
the
infant
so
that
should
any
disease
or
misfortune
in
the
shape
of
a
kind
of
evil
spirit
be
tempted
to
enter
the
child
body
it
may
be
averted
and
enter
the
doll
instead
should
a
person
fall
ill
new
are
stuck
in
the
hearth
as
the
ainu
share
our
own
idea
that
evil
spirits
dwell
mostly
in
fire
others
are
placed
near
the
sick
person
they
are
not
meant
as
offerings
to
the
gods
for
his
or
her
quick
recovery
but
merely
to
bring
good
luck
to
the
individual
whose
body
they
think
has
been
taken
possession
of
by
animals

or
in
other

even
at
the
present
day
in
england
and
on
the
continent
horseshoes
for

are
hung
over
entrance
doors
and
if
a
horseshoe
be
fastened
on
to
a
the
beasts

are
supposed
to
be
held
free
from

and
illness
in
spain
and
italy
little
red
rags
tied
to
a
small
wand
not
dissimilar
in
shape
to
a
small
ainu
are
stuck
in
near
windows
over
beds
doors
and
up
chimneys
to
keep
witches
at
bay
red
being
a
powerful
exorcist
in
the
way
of
colours
and
as
good
as
the
running
stream
which
witches
dare
not
cross
some
hysterical
women
have
declared
that
they
have
seen
witches
hiding
in
the
smoke
of
the
boiling
the
earthenware
pot
in
which
the
soup
is
boiled
but
that
on
seeing
the
red
rags
they
vanished
and
never
visited
the
house
again
italian
and
spanish
women
and
children
almost
invariably
carry
charms
round
their
necks
that
are
to
keep
them
safe
from
harm
and
furthermore
when
a
child
falls
ill
one
or
more
red
rags
are
fastened
to
its
bed
before
a
doctor
is
sent
for
then
again
people
suffering
from
epileptic
fits
have
often
been
supposed
to
be
possessed
and
beaten
to
death
or
burnt
alive
so
that
the
evil
spirit
which
was
in
them
should
thus
be
destroyed
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
not
many
centuries
ago
similar
beliefs
were
prevalent
even
in
free
and
enlightened
england
if
we
compare
these
beliefs
with
those
of
the
ainu
we
find
that
they
differ
very
little
either
in
form
or
substance
in
place
of
the
witches
which
our
own
ancestors
modern
italians
and
spaniards
and
some
benighted
peasantry
still
to
be
found
in
the
west
of
england
believed
and
do
still
believe
in
the
ainu
have
imaginary
animals
or
evil
spirits
the
wands
and
red
rags
of
our
latin
neighbours
are
represented
by
their
and
our
lucky
horseshoe
is
with
them
the
horizontal
charms
are
worn
by
the
ainu
men
women
and
children
and
when
going
to
war
or
to
hunt
the
men
carry
a
block
of
wood
to
which
their
knife
or
sword
is
attached
and
on
the
side
of
which
hangs
a
small
these
blocks
of
wood
are
flattened
and
are
elliptical
at
both
ends
their
length
varies
from
four
to
fifteen
inches
and
sometimes
ornaments
generally
circles
are
carved
on
them
a
string
is
fastened
on
one
side
so
as
to
sling
them
to
the
shoulder
but
they
are
usually
carried
under
the
arm
they
are
supposed
to
protect
the
carrier
from
accidents
and
also
to
bring
him
good
fortune
we
see
then
that
similar
ideas
are
entertained
by
utterly
different
peoples
thousands
of
miles
distant
from
one
another
and
that
certain
superstitious
beliefs
left
on
this
side
of
the
globe
find
their
parallel
among
the
hairy
people
on
the
other
of
course
with
them
it
is
natural
that
their
beliefs
should
count
for
more
than
with
europeans
as
civilisation
has
not
in
any
way
enlarged
or
improved
their
minds
but
it
seems
to
me
unfair
that
the
same
identical
beliefs
should
go
under
the
name
of
when
applied
to
europeans
and
called
the
ainu
religion
when
practised
by
the
hairy
inhabitants
of
northern
japan
though
to
this
i
know
it
may
be
replied
that
as
all
things
spring
from
germs
so
these
ignorant
superstitions
of
the
ainu
may
be
in
a
manner
called
their
religion
as
the
germ
of
a
more
developed
system
the
cotyledonous
state
of
what
might
grow
into
a
more
advanced
spirituality
like
the
ancient
greeks
and
romans
the
ainu
wave
their
during
their
libations
towards
the
sun
the
fire
and
the
person
who
has
paid
for
the
wine
before
they
address
themselves
to
the
large
wooden
bowls
wherein
lies
their
happiness
but
this
also
is
not
a
religious
ceremony
and
no
religious
feeling
whatever
is
connected
with
it
it
is
a
mere
part
of
their
etiquette
which
exactly
corresponds
to
the
german
or
to
our
english
your
good
health
the
ainu
of
course
have
no
special
no
sundays
no
religious
services
no
prayers
no
priests
no
sacrificial
priests
no
churches
and
no
bells
but
they
can
swear
and
as
the
neapolitans
invoke
their
saints
so
they
occasionally
call
the
sun
the
moon
the
fire
and
everything
else
all
sorts
of
bad
names
if
things
do
not
go
as
they
ought
this
swearing
has
been
defined
as
by
one
authority
on
the
ainu
religion
moreover
the
same
authority
calls
the
ainu
a
distinctly
religious
people
and
an
exceedingly
religious
race
to
anyone
who
visits
a
country
and
regards
all
that
he
finds
from
one
point
of
view
only
it
is
not
difficult
to
interpret
words
and
things
in
accordance
with
the
preconceived
idea
but
however
high
the
principles
sought
to
be
established
i
do
not
consider
a
man
justified
in
attributing
to
definite
facts
an
importance
and
significance
to
which
they
have
no
claim
i
have
no
doubt
that
a
native
who
had
associated
with
or
been
in
the
employment
of
a
christian
would
make
statements
in
accordance
with
his
master
belief
as
it
had
been
taught
him
but
it
is
incorrect
to
offer
these
borrowed
statements
as
the
religious
beliefs
of
a
whole
nation
i
shall
not
discuss
this
question
at
greater
length
but
for
the
sake
of
readers
who
are
interested
in
the
subject
it
may
be
well
to
make
two
or
three
more
statements
before
closing
this
chapter
the
ainu
do
not
know
of
a
heaven
and
hell
but
in
one
of
the
latest
publications
on
the
aborigines
of
japan
we
are
told
that
they
do
and
moreover
that
they
are
fully
aware
of
the
resurrection
of
the
body
in
the
other
world
even
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
ainu
are
theists
or
polytheists
after
what
we
have
heard
of
their
gods
this
is
a
somewhat
surprising
statement
it
will
be
remembered
that
anything
good
or
bad
dreaded
or
repulsive
respected
or
not
respected
is
qualified
by
the
ainu
as
and
we
shall
attribute
for
a
while
the
imaginary
meaning
of
god
to
the
word
now
if
everything
and
everybody
good
or
bad
is
equally
a
god
i
myself
fail
to
see
the
necessity
of
a
hell
as
the
chances
are
that
all
the
gods
would
inhabit
heaven
this
alone
serves
to
show
how
absurd
the
theory
is
but
i
wish
to
give
the
exact
translation
of
the
words
and
which
are
said
to
be
the
two
ainu
expressions
for
heaven
and
hell
means
sky
not
heaven
stands
for
the
wet
earth
under
ground
as
the
ainu
are
in
the
habit
of
burying
their
dead
i
find
it
more
rational
to
apply
to
the
words
in
question
the
meaning
of
a
a
cold
place
of
rest
rather
than
that
of
hades
or
gehenna
wet
under
earth
place
island
they
the
ainu
says
a
learned
missionary
seem
to
conceive
of
men
and
women
as
living
in
large
communities
in
the
other
world
in
the
same
way
and
under
the
same
conditions
as
they
do
in
this
excepting
that
they
can
know
no
death
in
other
words
resurrection
of
the
body
and
eternal
life
strange
to
say
the
writer
of
the
same
lines
asserted
in
the
transactions
of
the
asiatic
society
of
japan
that
the
ainu
of
a
resurrection
of
the
body
vol
part
it
must
not
be
argued
that
because
they
have
no
religion
the
ainu
are
bad
people
they
are
far
from
it
they
are
decidedly
not
moral
for
nothing
is
immoral
among
them
the
ainu
must
be
considered
more
as
animals
than
as
human
beings
when
we
speak
of
a
dog
we
do
not
ask
whether
it
is
a
moral
dog
but
only
if
it
is
a
good
dog
the
same
can
be
said
of
the
ainu
we
can
not
compare
them
to
ourselves
nor
judge
them
by
our
own
standard
of
morality
taken
by
themselves
they
are
gentle
kind
brave
and
above
everything
they
are
simple
their
language
manners
customs
arts
habits
as
we
have
seen
are
the
very
simplest
and
rudest
possible
thus
it
is
absurd
to
suppose
that
such
simple
brains
could
entertain
high
religious
ideas
if
they
had
brains
enough
to
compass
high
religious
beliefs
they
would
long
ago
have
used
those
brains
in
bettering
their
miserable
condition
and
filthy
mode
of
living
they
would
have
striven
to
make
the
beginnings
of
a
history
and
a
literature
or
at
least
to
have
devised
or
adopted
some
mode
of
writing
with
which
they
could
preserve
these
high
ideas
and
pass
them
on
from
generation
to
generation
even
their
language
is
so
poor
in
words
as
to
hardly
express
their
everyday
wants
the
ainu
are
low
in
the
scale
of
humanity
they
have
always
been
low
they
have
not
sunk
for
they
have
never
risen
they
have
never
done
any
harm
in
this
world
and
they
will
never
do
any
good
the
ainu
are
without
laws
which
paradoxical
as
it
sounds
to
a
great
extent
makes
them
good
people
are
never
so
good
as
when
no
harm
can
be
done
there
are
indeed
few
crimes
among
them
no
voluntary
infanticides
very
very
rarely
murders
no
suicides
little
theft
and
as
little
treachery
among
people
of
the
same
tribe
though
usually
retiring
and
reserved
they
are
hospitable
on
special
occasions
and
generous
with
what
little
they
possess
the
young
show
an
instinctive
reverence
for
the
aged
without
considering
it
a
virtue
or
a
duty
cowardice
is
despised
by
the
ainu
but
courage
endurance
of
pain
and
hardship
drunkenness
and
similar
qualities
are
looked
on
as
the
chief
virtues
in
men
punishments
are
seldom
inflicted
by
ainu
on
any
of
their
tribesmen
and
the
crime
must
indeed
be
great
to
raise
the
whole
community
against
the
criminal
if
by
rare
chance
some
great
evil
has
been
done
the
chief
of
the
village
and
all
the
men
assemble
and
decide
on
the
punishment
to
be
inflicted
flogging
is
the
general
punishment
for
the
lesser
crimes
which
according
to
ainu
ideas
are
theft
and
assault
the
murder
of
a
tribesman
is
sometimes
punished
by
cutting
the
tendons
of
the
hands
and
feet
of
the
murderer
thus
disabling
him
from
hunting
or
fishing
if
however
the
man
murdered
was
of
another
tribe
or
a
japanese
this
draconian
kind
of
justice
is
not
administered
quarrels
among
tribesmen
are
settled
by
private
retribution
and
no
one
interferes
either
one
way
or
the
other
these
quarrels
however
very
seldom
occur
as
the
ainu
are
naturally
a
peaceful
people
imprisonment
does
not
exist
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
ainu
have
no
prisons
they
do
not
know
what
a
prison
is
neither
is
capital
punishment
practised
by
them
according
to
their
own
ideas
they
are
not
cruel
to
children
for
we
seldom
see
them
wilfully
them
but
according
to
civilised
notions
ainu
women
make
shockingly
bad
mothers
they
love
but
they
do
not
look
after
nor
practically
take
care
of
their
little
ones
after
these
are
about
a
year
and
a
half
old
and
as
to
washing
them
combing
their
hair
educating
them
or
trying
to
cure
them
of
the
thousand
and
one
wretched
skin
diseases
which
come
chiefly
by
their
own
neglect
an
ainu
mother
puts
her
hand
to
these
things
no
more
than
the
men
put
theirs
to
the
building
of
a
temple
or
the
creation
of
a
literature
this
neglect
is
not
with
them
as
it
would
be
with
us
an
intolerable
crime
but
is
the
natural
result
of
their
animal
instinct
as
contradistinguished
from
rational
development
for
if
a
baby
is
not
old
enough
at
one
and
a
half
years
of
age
to
take
care
of
himself
he
is
of
no
good
as
an
ainu
it
is
needless
to
add
that
in
these
circumstances
most
of
them
are
of
no
good
and
that
the
percentage
of
infantile
deaths
is
appalling
to
a
civilised

marital
relations
and
causes
that
limit
population
the
laws
of
marriage
in
the
ainu
country
are
not
very
stringent
in
fact
there
are
no
laws
if
a
young
man
takes
a
fancy
to
a
pretty
hairy
maid
and
the
maid
reciprocates
his
affections
all
they
have
to
do
is
to
go
and
live
together
and
there
is
no
grundy
to
be
scandalised
at
the
want
of
closer
forms
and
ceremonies
there
is
no
function
to
celebrate
the
occasion
there
are
no
wedding
presents
no
bridesmaids
no
officiating
clergyman
and
no
old
slipper
flung
after
the
happy
pair
as
soon
as
the
knot
is
tied
the
bridegroom
either
goes
to
live
in
his
bride
hut
or
if
he
does
not
care
for
his
he
will
bring
his
to
his
own
father
hut
usually
however
the
two
especially
if
their
respective
families
are
large
prefer
to
build
a
hut
of
their
own
the
honeymoon
is
spent
in
and
while
the
bride
carries
the
loads
of
timber
and
long
reeds
the
bridegroom
accomplishes
the
more
difficult
task
of
putting
them
together
as
well
as
he
can
for
future
shelter
all
goes
well
with
the
happy
couple
until
the
roof
has
to
be
lifted
up
bodily
and
perched
on
the
forked
poles
during
which
process
family
rows
generally
begin
but
they
do
not
last
long
and
when
the
house
is
finished
though
not
decorated
home
peace
reigns
within
and
the
bridegroom
as
we
have
already
seen
proceeds
to
ornament
his
chief
treasure
his
wife
with
tattoos
on
her
arms
this
idyllic
state
of
things
is
not
specially
permanent
for
soon
after
this
first
marriage
the
ainu
feels
that
he
would
like
another
wife
and
without
thinking
twice
about
it
he
marries
again
though
savage
and
barbarian
the
ainu
is
shrewd
enough
not
to
take
his
second
wife
to
live
with
his
first
for
he
knows
what
the
result
would
be
human
nature
being
the
same
in
yezo
as
it
is
in
london
and
jealousy
as
strong
among
the
tattooed
women
of
the
hairy
people
as
among
the
daughters
of
the
west
all
women
are
bad
enough
when
out
of
temper
but
the
ainu
women
are
in
this
respect
our
bigamist
calls
his
first
wife
great
wife
and
he
calls
the
other
small
wife
and
as
long
as
the
two
females
do
not
live
under
the
same
roof
they
are
all
happy
with
the
arrangement
if
indeed
he
chooses
to
have
more
than
these
two
wives
he
thinks
small
blame
to
himself
there
is
no
bar
of
any
kind
in
his
code
to
his
having
a
third
half
but
this
seldom
happens
now
for
the
women
are
not
in
such
over
abundance
in
the
ainu
country
as
to
allow
each
man
to
indulge
in
a
triple
alliance
the
ainu
are
therefore
polygamists
when
they
can
find
the
third
woman
and
almost
always
bigamists
when
this
is
possible
the
wife
does
not
take
her
husband
name
for
no
ainu
has
a
family
surname
and
each
man
or
woman
is
called
after
some
peculiarity
which
he
or
she
possesses
or
after
some
event
or
accident
which
has
befallen
them
for
instance
a
man
name
means
and
dangerous
ainu
and
a
woman
name
means
who
burst
three
times
and
so
on
each
person
having
a
different
name
which
is
nothing
more
than
a
when
the
girl
gets
married
she
does
not
drop
this
neither
as
has
been
said
does
she
take
her
husband
name
though
sometimes
she
is
called
wife
supposing
that
miss
were
to
marry
she
would
be
wife
and
would
still
be
called
by
her
maiden
name
it
is
impossible
to
quote
exact
statistics
of
the
ainu
population
and
whether
the
women
outnumber
the
men
but
from
my
own
observation
i
should
think
that
females
are
in
excess
of
the
males
in
some
districts
and
about
even
in
others
the
man
naturally
is
the
lord
and
master
of
the
household
and
the
wife
is
like
a
kind
of
inferior
being
or
a
slave
whose
duty
it
is
to
obey
her
male
companion
she
has
to
yield
in
everything
whether
she
is
right
or
wrong
she
is
occasionally
beaten
she
never
takes
active
part
in
any
of
her
husband
bacchanalian
revels
but
though
she
leads
a
sad
kind
of
life
a
life
of
hard
work
and
no
pleasure
she
does
not
seem
to
be
any
the
worse
for
it
there
are
wives
of
course
who
as
in
other
countries
give
a
pretty
rough
time
to
their
husbands
but
in
the
ainu
country
these
are
certainly
the
exception
as
there
is
no
ceremony
of
marriage
there
is
naturally
no
divorce
but
if
an
ainu
gets
sick
of
his
wife
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
leave
her
and
go
elsewhere
or
else
to
banish
her
from
his
hut
this
however
very
seldom
happens
for
that
rare
creature
the
henpecked
ainu
husband
is
willing
to
put
up
with
a
lot
and
though
brave
enough
to
encounter
a
bear
the
hairy
man
is
by
no
means
valiant
enough
to
face
his
wife
temper
while
for
all
that
she
is
practically
a
slave
and
personally
an
inferior
is
sometimes
in
ainuland
as
everywhere
else
the
strongest
factor
in
the
domestic
sum
as
long
as
the
wife
does
her
duty
well
as
a
beast
of
burden
little
more
is
required
from
her
her
morals
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
are
not
well
looked
after
adultery
is
not
considered
a
crime
i
do
not
mean
by
this
that
adultery
is
practised
on
principle
for
it
is
not
so
there
is
no
reason
whatever
why
it
should
be
for
each
man
has
his
own
wife
or
wives
but
if
adultery
were
practised
by
any
members
of
a
community
what
we
consider
a
dreadful
crime
would
be
regarded
as
a
mere
joke
among
the
hairy
people
the
husband
like
any
other
animal
dumb
or
not
would
naturally
resent
the
intrusion
but
the
community
would
in
no
way
interfere
or
punish
the
offender
a
girl
is
considered
fit
to
be
married
when
she
is
about
sixteen
years
of
age
a
man
about
twenty
or
as
soon
as
the
body
is
fully
developed
people
as
a
rule
marry
in
the
same
village
it
is
but
seldom
that
a
girl
marries
a
man
or
a
man
a
girl
of
a
different
village
villages
as
we
have
seen
are
generally
composed
of
only
a
few
houses
and
the
result
of
this
strict
endogamy
is
that
marriages
take
place
among
very
near
relations
in
very
small
villages
of
only
one
or
two
houses
the
father
has
been
known
to
marry
his
own
daughter
the
uncle
his
own
niece
but
enough
of
this
the
result
of
this
dreadful
state
of
affairs
is
that
the
race
is
rapidly
dying
out
destroyed
by
consumption
lunacy
and
poverty
of
blood
all
the
members
of
one
village
are
necessarily
related
to
one
another
and
as
i
have
demonstrated
in
a
previous
chapter
this
is
the
main
cause
why
certain
diseases
are
common
to
one
community
and
utterly
unknown
to
others
and
certain
hereditary
talents
or
tendencies
are
frequent
in
one
village
and
imperceptible
in
the
next
the
ainu
seem
to
have
no
platonic
love
their
love
is
purely
sexual
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
in
a
country
where
marital
relations
are
so
peculiar
that
very
little
love
is
felt
for
children
beyond
a
certain
age
the
mother
suckles
her
own
child
usually
for
seven
or
eight
months
she
can
bear
children
till
she
is
about
though
some
who
seem
to
be
much
older
are
still
fruitful
it
was
difficult
to
ascertain
this
fact
for
no
ainu
knows
his
own
age
as
far
as
i
could
learn
fertility
is
neither
hindered
nor
checked
in
any
way
either
by
adopting
a
peculiar
diet
or
by
other
practices
on
the
other
hand
many
a
woman
is
sterile
and
many
are
also
affected
with
the
most
horrible
of
all
diseases
i
am
inclined
to
think
however
that
this
special
malady
was
imported
to
yezo
with
japanese
civilisation
for
it
is
in
the
more
civilised
parts
of
the
ainu
country
that
it
is
most
frequent
there
is
probably
no
country
in
the
world
where
there
is
so
much
loss
of
infant
life
due
to
want
accidents
and
diseases
as
with
the
ainu
abortion
is
common
owing
to
the
severe
exertion
of
the
mother
during
pregnancy
and
many
a
child
dies
not
many
days
after
birth
for
the
same
reason
and
consequent
disappearance
of
milk
in
the
mother
breasts
the
greater
mortality
of
children
however
is
between
the
age
of
six
and
ten
only
a
small
percentage
of
these
poor
creatures
live
to
take
part
in
the
game
of
life
while
many
succumb
to
and
the
most
horrible
skin
eruptions
thus
we
have
a
good
explanation
of
the
frightful
rapidity
with
which
the
ainu
race
is
fast
disappearing
naturally
those
few
who
survive
grow
strong
and
healthy
but
their
great
fondness
for
alcoholic
drinks
which
they
can
now
so
easily
procure
from
the
japanese
destroys
even
them
one
is
generally
struck
in
ainuland
by
the
number
of
old
men
and
children
and
by
the
almost
entire
lack
of
young
fellows
between
the
age
of
fifteen
and
thirty
this
is
due
mainly
to
the
great
increase
of
mortality
in
children
during
the
last
two
generations
the
sadness
which
seems
to
oppress
the
ainu
and
which
we
see
depicted
on
the
face
of
each
individual
is
nothing
but
the
outcome
of
this
degeneration
of
the
race
as
a
race
the
ainu
will
soon
be
extinct
i
dare
say
that
in
fifty
years
from
now
probably
not
so
long
not
one
of
the
hairy
savages
who
were
once
the
masters
of
sakhalin
yezo
the
kuriles
kamschatka
and
the
whole
of
the
southern
japanese
empire
will
be
left
not
one
of
these
strange
people
soft
good
and
gentle
but
savage
brave
and
disreputable
will
live
to
see
their
country
civilised
and
in
the
life
which
they
have
led
of
filth
and
vice
they
will
die
in
front
of
that
greater
scourge
civilisation
leaving
behind
no
traces
of
themselves
of
their
past
of
their
history
nor
of
their
