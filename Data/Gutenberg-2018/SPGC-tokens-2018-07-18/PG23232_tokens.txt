the
servant
problem
selling
a
whole
town
and
doing
it
inconspicuously
can
be
a
little
difficult
either
giving
it
away
freely
or
in
a
more
normal
sense
of
selling
people
do
quite
believe

if
you
have
ever
lived
in
a
small
town
you
have
seen
francis
pfleuger
and
probably
you
have
sent
him
after
and
pails
of
steam
and
laughed
uproariously
behind
his
back
when
he
set
forth
to
do
your
bidding
the
francis
pfleugers
of
the
world
have
inspired
both
fun
and
laughter
for
generations
out
of
mind
the
francis
pfleuger
we
are
concerned
with
here
lived
in
a
small
town
named
valleyview
and
in
addition
to
suffering
the
distinction
of
being
the
village
idiot
he
also
suffered
the
distinction
of
being
the
village
inventor
these
two
distinctions
frequently
go
hand
in
hand
and
afford
in
their
incongruous
togetherness
an
even
greater
inspiration
for
fun
and
laughter
for
in
this
advanced
age
of
streamlined
electric
can
openers
and
sleek
toasters
who
but
the
most
na√Øve
among
us
can
fail
to
be
titillated
by
the
thought
of
a
moron
building
rube
goldberg
contrivances
in
his
basement
the
francis
pfleuger
we
are
concerned
with
did
his
inventing
in
his
kitchen
rather
than
in
his
basement
nevertheless
his
machines
were
in
the
rube
goldberg
tradition
take
the
one
he
was
assembling
now
for
example
it
stood
on
the
kitchen
table
and
its
various
attachments
jutted
this
way
and
that
with
no
apparent
rhyme
or
reason
in
its
center
there
was
a
transparent
globe
that
looked
like
an
goldfish
bowl
and
in
the
center
of
the
bowl
there
was
an
object
that
startlingly
resembled
a
goldfish
but
which
of
course
was
nothing
of
the
sort
whatever
it
was
though
it
kept
growing
brighter
and
brighter
each
time
francis
added
another
attachment
and
had
already
attained
a
degree
of
incandescence
so
intense
that
he
had
been
forced
to
don
goggles
in
order
to
look
at
it
the
date
was
the
first
of
april
april
fool
day
actually
the
idea
for
this
particular
machine
had
not
originated
in
francis
brain
nor
had
the
parts
for
it
originated
in
his
when
he
had
gone
out
to
get
the
milk
that
morning
he
had
found
a
box
on
his
doorstep
and
in
the
box
he
had
found
the
goldfish
bowl
and
the
attachments
plus
a
sheet
of
instructions
entitled
directions
for
assembling
a
multiple
dynamo
francis
thought
that
a
machine
capable
of
tying
knots
would
be
pretty
keen
and
he
had
carried
the
box
into
the
kitchen
and
set
to
work
forthwith
he
now
had
but
one
more
part
to
go
and
he
proceeded
to
screw
it
into
place
then
he
stepped
back
to
admire
his
handiwork
simultaneously
his
handiwork
went
into
action
the
attachments
began
to
quiver
and
to
emit
sparks
the
globe
glowed
and
the
goldfishlike
object
in
its
center
began
to
dart
this
way
and
that
as
though
striking
at
flies
a
blue
halo
formed
above
the
machine
and
began
to
rotate
faster
and
faster
it
rotated
till
finally
its
gaseous
components
separated
and
flew
off
in
a
hundred
different
directions
three
things
happened
then
in
swift
succession
francis
back
doorway
took
on
a
bluish
cast
the
sheet
of
instructions
vanished
and
the
machine
began
to
melt
a
moment
later
he
heard
a
whining
sound
on
his
back
doorstep
simultaneously
all
of
the
residents
of
valleyview
heard
whining
sounds
on
back
doorsteps
naturally
everybody
went
to
find
out
about
the
whining
the
sign
was
a
new
one
at
the
most
it
was
no
more
than
six
months
old
you
are
entering
the
village
of
valleyview
it
said
please
drive
carefully
we
are
fond
of
our
dogs
philip
myles
drove
carefully
he
was
fond
of
dogs
too
night
had
tiptoed
in
over
the
october
countryside
quite
some
time
ago
but
the
village
of
valleyview
had
not
turned
on
so
much
as
a
single
streetlight
nor
apparently
any
other
kind
of
light
all
was
in
darkness
and
not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
philip
began
to
suspect
that
he
had
entered
a
ghost
town
and
when
his
headlights
darted
across
a
dark
intersection
and
picked
up
the
overgrown
grass
and
unkempt
shrubbery
of
the
village
park
he
was
convinced
that
he
had
then
he
saw
the
girl
walking
the
dog
he
the
intersection
and
pulled
up
alongside
her
she
was
a
blonde
tall
and
chic
in
a
gray
fall
suit
her
face
was
attractive
beautiful
even
in
a
cold
and
classic
way
but
she
would
never
see
again
but
then
philip
would
never
again
see
thirty
when
she
paused
her
dog
paused
too
although
she
did
not
have
it
on
a
leash
it
was
on
the
small
side
tawny
in
hue
with
eyes
a
slender
tail
and
shaggy
ears
that
hung
down
on
either
side
of
its
face
in
a
manner
reminiscent
of
a
cocker
spaniel
it
was
a
cocker
spaniel
though
the
ears
were
much
too
long
for
one
thing
and
the
tail
was
much
too
delicate
for
another
it
was
a
breed
or
combination
of
breeds
that
philip
had
never
seen
before
he
leaned
across
the
seat
and
rolled
down
the
window
could
you
direct
me
to
number
locust
street
he
asked
it
the
residence
of
judith
darrow
the
village
attorney
maybe
you
know
her
the
girl
gave
a
start
are
the
man
i
sent
for
philip
gave
a
start
too
recovering
himself
he
said
then
judith
darrow
i
i
afraid
i
a
little
late
the
girl
eyes
flashed
the
radiant
backwash
of
the
headlights
revealed
them
to
be
both
green
and
gray
i
specified
in
my
letter
that
you
were
supposed
to
be
here
at
nine
this
morning
she
said
maybe
you
tell
me
how
you
going
to
appraise
property
in
the
dark
i
sorry
philip
said
my
car
broke
down
on
the
way
and
i
had
to
wait
for
it
to
be
fixed
when
i
tried
to
call
you
the
operator
told
me
that
your
phone
had
been
disconnected
if
you
direct
me
to
the
hotel
i
stay
there
overnight
and
appraise
your
property
in
the
morning
there
a
hotel
is
there
there
is
but
it
closed
zarathustra
down
the
dog
had
raised
up
on
its
hind
legs
and
placed
its
forepaws
on
the
door
in
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
peer
in
the
window
at
the
girl
command
it
sank
obediently
down
on
its
haunches
except
for
zarathustra
and
myself
she
went
on
the
village
is
empty
everyone
else
has
already
moved
out
and
have
moved
out
too
if
i
had
been
entrusted
with
arranging
for
the
sale
of
the
business
places
and
the
houses
it
makes
for
a
rather
awkward
situation
she
had
leaned
forward
and
the
light
from
the
dash
lay
palely
upon
her
face
softening
its
austerity
i
do
get
this
at
all
philip
said
from
your
letter
i
assumed
you
had
two
or
three
places
you
wanted
me
to
sell
but
not
a
whole
town
there
must
have
been
at
least
a
thousand
people
living
here
and
a
thousand
people
just
do
pack
up
and
move
out
all
at
once
when
she
volunteered
no
explanation
he
added
where
did
they
move
to
to
pfleugersville
i
know
you
never
heard
of
it
so
save
the
observation
then
do
you
have
any
identification
she
asked
he
gave
her
his
driver
license
his
business
card
and
the
letter
she
had
written
him
after
glancing
at
them
she
handed
them
back
she
appeared
to
be
undecided
about
something
why
do
you
let
me
stay
at
the
hotel
he
suggested
you
must
have
the
key
if
it
one
of
the
places
i
supposed
to
appraise
she
shook
her
head
i
have
the
key
but
there
not
a
stick
of
furniture
in
the
place
we
had
a
village
auction
last
week
and
got
rid
of
everything
that
we
did
plan
on
taking
with
us
she
sighed
well
there
nothing
for
it
i
guess
the
nearest
motel
is
thirty
miles
away
so
i
have
to
put
you
up
at
my
house
i
have
a
few
articles
of
furniture
left
wedding
gifts
mostly
that
i
was
too
sentimental
to
part
with
she
got
into
the
car
come
on
zarathustra
zarathustra
clambered
in
leaped
across
her
lap
and
sat
down
between
them
philip
pulled
away
from
the
curb
that
an
odd
name
for
a
dog
he
said
i
know
i
guess
the
reason
i
gave
it
to
him
is
because
he
puts
me
in
mind
of
a
little
old
man
sometimes
but
the
original
zarathustra
is
noted
for
his
longevity
perhaps
another
association
was
at
work
then
turn
right
at
the
next
corner
a
lonely
light
burned
in
one
of
number
locust
street
three
front
windows
its
source
however
was
not
an
incandescent
bulb
but
the
mantle
of
a
gasoline
lantern
the
village
was
shut
off
yesterday
judith
darrow
explained
pumping
the
lantern
into
renewed
brightness
she
glanced
at
him
sideways
did
you
have
dinner
as
a
matter
of
fact
no
but
please
do
bother
i
could
if
i
wanted
to
my
larder
is
on
its
last
legs
but
sit
down
and
i
make
you
some
sandwiches
i
make
a
pot
of
coffee
too
the
gas
has
been
turned
off
yet
the
living
room
had
precisely
three
articles
of
furniture
to
its
name
two
armchairs
and
a
coffee
table
after
judith
left
him
philip
set
his
brief
case
on
the
floor
and
sat
down
in
one
of
the
chairs
he
wondered
idly
how
she
expected
to
make
the
trip
to
pfleugersville
he
had
seen
no
car
in
the
driveway
and
there
was
no
garage
on
the
property
in
which
one
could
be
concealed
moreover
it
was
highly
unlikely
that
buses
serviced
the
village
any
more
valleyview
had
been
bypassed
quite
some
time
ago
by
one
of
the
new
highways
he
shrugged
getting
to
pfleugersville
was
her
problem
not
his
he
returned
his
attention
to
the
living
room
it
was
a
large
room
the
house
was
large
too
large
and
victorianesque
judith
apparently
had
opened
the
back
door
for
a
breeze
was
wafting
through
the
downstairs
rooms
a
breeze
laden
with
the
scent
of
flowers
and
the
breath
of
growing
grass
he
frowned
the
month
was
october
not
june
and
since
when
did
flowers
bloom
and
grass
grow
in
october
he
concluded
that
the
scent
must
be
artificial
zarathustra
was
regarding
him
with
large
golden
eyes
from
the
middle
of
the
floor
the
animal
did
somehow
bring
to
mind
a
little
old
man
although
he
could
not
have
been
more
than
two
or
three
years
old
you
not
very
good
company
philip
said
ruf
said
zarathustra
and
turning
trotted
through
an
archway
into
a
large
room
that
judging
from
the
empty
shelves
lining
its
walls
had
once
been
a
library
and
thence
through
another
archway
into
another
room
the
dining
room
undoubtedly
and
out
of
sight
philip
leaned
back
wearily
in
the
armchair
he
had
chosen
he
was
beat
take
six
days
a
week
ten
hours
a
day
and
multiply
by
and
you
get
three
hundred
and
twelve
three
hundred
and
twelve
days
a
year
hunting
down
clients
talking
walking
driving
expounding
trying
in
his
early
thirties
to
build
the
foundation
he
should
have
begun
building
in
his
early
twenties
the
foundation
for
the
family
he
had
suddenly
realized
he
wanted
and
someday
hoped
to
have
sometimes
he
wished
that
ambition
had
missed
him
altogether
instead
of
waiting
for
so
long
to
strike
sometimes
he
wished
he
could
have
gone
right
on
being
what
he
once
had
been
after
all
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
living
in
cheap
hotels
and
even
cheaper
rooming
houses
there
was
nothing
wrong
in
being
a
lackadaisical
salesman
with
heels
nothing
wrong
that
is
except
the
aching
want
that
came
over
you
sometimes
and
the
loneliness
of
long
and
empty
evenings
zarathustra
had
the
room
and
was
sitting
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
again
he
had
not
returned
or
rather
although
the
object
he
had
brought
with
him
was
not
the
sort
of
object
dogs
generally
pick
up
it
was
a
rose
a
green
rose
disbelievingly
philip
leaned
forward
and
took
it
from
the
mouth
before
he
had
a
chance
to
examine
it
however
footsteps
sounded
in
the
next
room
and
prompted
by
he
knew
not
what
he
thrust
the
rose
into
his
suitcoat
pocket
an
instant
later
judith
darrow
came
through
the
archway
bearing
a
large
tray
after
setting
it
down
on
the
coffee
table
she
poured
two
cups
of
coffee
from
a
little
silver
pot
and
indicated
a
plate
of
sandwiches
please
help
yourself
she
said
she
sat
down
in
the
other
chair
and
sipped
her
coffee
he
had
one
of
the
sandwiches
found
that
he
did
want
any
more
somehow
her
proximity
coupled
with
her
silence
made
him
feel
uncomfortable
has
your
husband
already
left
for
pfleugersville
he
asked
politely
her
eyes
grew
cold
yes
he
left
quite
some
time
ago
she
said
a
year
ago
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
for
parts
unknown
not
pfleugersville
pfleugersville
was
accessible
then
anyway
he
had
a
brunette
on
one
arm
a
redhead
on
the
other
and
a
pint
of
cutty
sark
in
his
hip
pocket
philip
was
distressed
i
i
did
mean
to
pry
he
said
i
sorry
why
should
you
be
some
men
are
born
to
settle
down
and
raise
children
and
others
are
born
to
drink
and
philander
it
as
simple
as
that
is
it
something
made
philip
ask
into
which
category
would
you
say
i
fall
you
in
a
class
by
yourself
tiny
silver
flecks
had
come
into
her
eyes
and
he
realized
to
his
astonishment
that
they
were
flecks
of
malevolence
you
never
married
but
playing
the
field
has
made
you
one
hundred
per
cent
cynical
you
still
convinced
that
somewhere
there
is
a
woman
worthy
of
your
devotion
and
you
quite
right
the
world
is
full
of
them
his
face
tingled
as
though
she
had
slapped
it
and
in
a
sense
she
had
he
restrained
his
anger
with
difficulty
i
did
know
that
my
celibacy
was
that
noticeable
he
said
it
is
i
took
the
liberty
of
having
a
private
investigator
check
into
your
background
it
proved
to
be
unsavory
in
some
respects
as
i
implied
before
but
unlike
the
backgrounds
of
the
other
agents
i
had
checked
it
contained
not
the
slightest
hint
of
dishonesty
the
nature
of
my
business
is
such
that
i
need
someone
of
maximum
integrity
to
contract
it
with
i
had
to
go
far
and
wide
to
find
you
you
being
unfair
philip
said
mollified
despite
himself
most
agents
are
honest
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
one
in
the
same
office
building
with
me
that
i
trust
with
the
family
jewels
if
i
had
any
family
jewels
good
judith
darrow
said
i
gambled
on
you
knowing
someone
like
that
he
waited
for
her
to
elaborate
and
when
she
did
not
he
finished
his
coffee
and
stood
up
if
you
do
mind
i
turn
in
he
said
had
a
pretty
hard
day
i
show
you
your
room
she
got
two
candles
lit
them
and
after
placing
them
in
gilt
candlesticks
handed
one
of
the
candlesticks
to
him
the
room
was
on
the
third
floor
in
under
the
eaves
as
faraway
from
hers
probably
as
the
size
of
the
house
permitted
philip
did
not
mind
he
liked
to
sleep
in
rooms
under
eaves
there
was
an
enchantment
about
the
rain
on
the
roof
that
people
who
slept
in
less
celestial
bowers
never
got
to
know
after
judith
left
he
threw
open
the
single
window
and
undressed
and
climbed
into
bed
remembering
the
rose
he
got
it
out
of
his
coat
pocket
and
examined
it
by
candlelight
it
was
green
all
right
even
greener
than
he
had
at
first
thought
its
scent
was
reminiscent
of
the
summer
breeze
that
was
blowing
through
the
downstairs
rooms
though
not
at
all
in
keeping
with
the
chill
october
air
that
was
coming
through
his
bedroom
window
he
laid
it
on
the
table
beside
the
bed
and
blew
out
the
candle
he
would
go
looking
for
the
bush
tomorrow
philip
was
an
early
riser
and
dawn
had
not
yet
departed
when
fully
dressed
he
left
the
room
with
the
rose
in
his
coat
pocket
and
quietly
descended
the
stairs
entering
the
living
room
he
found
zarathustra
curled
up
in
one
of
the
armchairs
and
for
a
moment
he
had
the
eerie
impression
that
the
animal
had
extended
one
of
his
shaggy
ears
and
was
scratching
his
back
with
it
when
philip
did
a
doubletake
however
the
ear
was
back
to
normal
size
and
reposing
on
its
owner
tawny
cheek
rubbing
the
sleep
out
of
his
eyes
he
said
come
on
zarathustra
going
for
a
walk
he
headed
for
the
back
door
zarathustra
at
his
heels
a
double
door
leading
off
the
dining
room
barred
his
way
and
proved
to
be
locked
frowning
he
returned
to
the
living
room
all
right
he
said
to
zarathustra
we
go
out
the
front
way
then
illustration
he
walked
around
the
side
of
the
house
his
canine
companion
trotting
beside
him
the
side
yard
turned
out
to
be
disappointing
it
contained
no
roses
green
ones
or
any
other
kind
about
all
it
did
contain
that
was
worthy
of
notice
was
a
dog
house
an
ancient
affair
that
was
much
too
large
for
zarathustra
and
which
probably
dated
from
the
days
when
judith
had
owned
a
larger
dog
the
yard
itself
was
a
mess
the
grass
had
been
cut
all
summer
the
shrubbery
was
ragged
and
dead
leaves
lay
everywhere
a
similar
state
of
affairs
existed
next
door
and
glancing
across
lots
he
saw
that
the
same
desuetude
prevailed
throughout
the
entire
neighborhood
obviously
the
good
citizens
of
valleyview
had
lost
interest
in
their
real
estate
long
before
they
had
moved
out
at
length
his
explorations
led
him
to
the
back
door
if
there
were
green
roses
anywhere
the
trellis
that
adorned
the
small
back
porch
was
the
logical
place
for
them
to
be
he
found
nothing
but
bedraggled
virginia
creeper
and
more
dead
leaves
he
tried
the
back
door
and
finding
it
locked
circled
the
rest
of
the
way
around
the
house
judith
was
waiting
for
him
on
the
front
porch
how
nice
of
you
to
walk
zarathustra
she
said
icily
i
do
hope
you
found
the
yard
in
order
illustration
the
yellow
dress
she
was
wearing
did
not
match
the
tone
of
her
voice
and
the
frilly
blue
apron
tied
round
her
waist
belied
the
frostiness
of
her
eyes
nevertheless
her
rancor
was
real
sorry
he
said
i
did
know
your
back
yard
was
out
of
bounds
then
if
give
me
a
list
of
the
places
you
want
evaluated
i
get
started
right
away
i
take
you
around
again
personally
after
we
have
breakfast
again
he
was
consigned
to
the
living
room
while
she
performed
the
necessary
culinary
operations
and
again
she
served
him
by
tray
clearly
she
did
not
want
him
in
the
kitchen
or
anywhere
near
it
he
was
not
much
of
a
one
for
mysteries
but
this
one
was
intriguing
him
more
and
more
by
the
minute
breakfast
over
she
told
him
to
wait
on
the
front
porch
while
she
did
the
dishes
and
instructed
zarathustra
to
keep
him
company
she
had
two
voices
the
one
she
used
in
addressing
zarathustra
contained
overtones
of
summer
and
the
one
she
used
in
addressing
philip
contained
overtones
of
fall
some
day
philip
told
the
little
dog
that
chip
she
carries
on
her
shoulder
is
going
to
fall
off
of
its
own
accord
and
by
then
it
will
be
too
late
the
way
it
was
too
late
for
me
when
i
found
out
that
the
person
i
been
running
away
from
all
my
life
was
myself
in
wolf
clothing
ruf
said
zarathustra
looking
up
at
him
with
benign
golden
eyes
presently
judith
sans
apron
and
the
three
of
them
set
forth
into
the
golden
october
day
it
was
philip
first
experience
in
evaluating
an
entire
village
but
he
had
a
knack
for
estimating
the
worth
of
property
and
by
the
time
noon
came
around
he
had
the
job
half
done
if
you
people
had
made
even
half
an
effort
to
keep
your
places
up
he
told
judith
over
sandwiches
and
coffee
in
her
living
room
we
could
have
asked
for
a
third
again
as
much
why
in
the
world
did
you
let
everything
go
to
pot
just
because
you
were
moving
some
place
else
she
shrugged
it
hard
to
get
anyone
to
do
housework
these
days
not
to
mention
gardening
besides
in
addition
to
the
servant
problem
there
another
consideration
human
nature
when
you
lived
in
a
shack
all
your
life
and
you
suddenly
acquire
a
palace
you
cease
caring
very
much
what
the
shack
looks
like
shack
philip
was
indignant
why
this
house
is
lovely
practically
every
house
you
shown
me
is
lovely
old
yes
but
oldness
is
an
essential
part
of
the
loveliness
of
houses
if
pfleugersville
is
on
the
order
of
most
housing
developments
i
seen
you
and
your
neighbors
are
going
to
be
good
and
sorry
one
of
these
fine
days
but
pfleugersville
is
on
the
order
of
most
housing
developments
you
seen
in
fact
it
not
a
housing
development
at
all
but
not
go
into
that
anyway
we
concerned
with
valleyview
not
pfleugersville
very
well
philip
said
this
afternoon
should
wind
things
up
so
far
as
the
appraising
goes
that
evening
after
a
supper
both
the
gas
and
the
water
had
been
turned
off
that
afternoon
he
totaled
up
his
figures
they
made
quite
a
respectable
sum
he
looked
across
the
coffee
table
which
he
had
commandeered
as
a
desk
to
where
judith
with
the
dubious
help
of
zarathustra
was
sorting
out
a
pile
of
manila
envelopes
which
she
had
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
i
do
my
best
to
sell
everything
he
said
but
it
going
to
be
difficult
going
till
we
get
a
few
families
living
here
people
are
reluctant
about
moving
into
empty
neighborhoods
and
businessmen
are
keen
about
opening
up
business
places
before
the
customers
are
available
but
i
think
it
work
out
all
right
there
a
plaza
not
far
from
here
that
will
provide
a
place
to
shop
until
the
local
markets
are
functioning
and
valleyview
is
part
of
a
centralized
school
district
he
slipped
the
paper
he
had
been
figuring
on
into
his
brief
case
closed
the
case
and
stood
up
keep
in
touch
with
you
judith
shook
her
head
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
as
soon
as
you
leave
i
moving
to
pfleugersville
my
business
here
is
finished
i
keep
in
touch
with
you
there
then
all
you
have
to
do
is
give
me
your
address
and
phone
number
she
shook
her
head
again
i
could
give
you
both
but
neither
would
do
you
any
good
but
that
beside
the
point
valleyview
is
your
responsibility
now
not
mine
philip
sat
back
down
again
you
can
start
explaining
any
time
he
said
it
very
simple
the
property
owners
of
valleyview
signed
all
of
their
houses
and
places
of
business
over
to
me
i
in
turn
have
signed
all
of
them
over
to
you
with
the
qualification
of
course
that
after
selling
them
you
will
be
entitled
to
no
more
than
your
usual
commission
she
withdrew
a
paper
from
one
of
the
manila
envelopes
after
selling
them
she
went
on
you
are
to
divide
the
proceeds
equally
among
the
four
charities
specified
in
this
contract
she
handed
him
the
paper
do
you
understand
now
why
i
tried
so
hard
to
find
a
trustworthy
agent
philip
was
staring
at
the
paper
unable
in
his
astonishment
to
read
the
words
it
contained
suppose
he
said
presently
that
circumstances
should
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
carry
out
my
end
of
the
agreement
in
case
of
illness
you
will
already
have
taken
the
necessary
steps
to
transfer
the
property
to
another
agent
who
in
your
opinion
is
as
completely
honest
as
you
are
and
in
case
of
death
you
will
already
have
taken
the
necessary
steps
to
bequeath
the
property
to
the
same
agent
and
he
in
both
cases
will
already
have
agreed
to
the
terms
laid
down
in
the
contract
you
holding
in
your
hands
why
do
you
read
it
now
that
his
astonishment
had
abated
somewhat
philip
found
that
he
could
do
so
but
this
still
does
make
sense
he
said
a
short
while
later
obviously
you
and
the
rest
of
the
owners
have
purchased
new
houses
would
it
be
presumptuous
of
me
to
ask
how
you
going
to
pay
for
them
when
you
virtually
giving
your
old
houses
away
i
afraid
it
would
be
mr
myles
she
withdrew
another
paper
from
the
envelope
and
handed
it
to
him
this
is
the
other
copy
if
you
kindly
affix
your
signature
to
both
we
can
bring
our
business
to
a
close
as
you
notice
i
already
signed
but
if
you
going
to
be
incommunicado
philip
pointed
out
anger
building
up
in
him
despite
all
he
could
do
to
stop
it
what
good
will
your
copy
do
you
judith
countenance
took
on
a
glacial
quality
so
did
her
voice
my
copy
will
go
into
the
hands
of
a
trusted
attorney
sealed
in
an
envelope
which
i
have
already
instructed
him
not
to
open
till
five
years
from
this
date
if
at
the
time
it
is
opened
you
have
violated
the
terms
of
our
agreement
he
will
institute
legal
proceedings
at
once
fortunately
although
the
valleyview
post
office
is
closed
a
mail
truck
passes
through
every
weekday
evening
at
eight
it
not
that
i
do
trust
you
myles
but
you
are
a
man
you
know
philip
was
tempted
to
tear
up
the
two
copies
then
and
there
and
toss
the
pieces
into
the
air
but
he
did
for
the
very
good
reason
that
he
could
afford
to
instead
he
bore
down
viciously
on
his
pen
and
brought
his
name
to
life
twice
in
large
and
angry
letters
he
handed
judith
one
copy
slipped
the
other
into
his
breast
pocket
and
got
to
his
feet
that
he
said
brings
our
official
business
to
a
close
now
like
to
add
an
unofficial
word
of
advice
it
seems
to
me
that
exacting
an
exorbitant
price
from
the
world
for
your
husband
having
sold
you
out
for
a
brunette
and
a
redhead
and
a
pint
of
scotch
been
sold
out
lots
of
times
for
less
than
that
but
i
found
out
long
ago
that
the
world
does
pay
its
bills
even
when
you
ask
a
fair
price
for
the
damages
done
to
you
i
suggest
that
you
write
the
matter
off
as
a
bad
debt
and
forget
about
it
then
maybe
you
become
a
human
being
again
she
had
risen
to
her
feet
and
was
standing
stiffly
before
him
she
put
him
in
mind
of
an
exquisite
and
fragile
statue
and
for
a
moment
he
had
the
feeling
that
if
he
were
to
reach
out
and
touch
her
she
would
shatter
into
a
million
pieces
she
did
not
move
for
some
time
nor
did
he
then
she
bent
down
picked
up
three
of
the
manila
envelopes
straightened
and
handed
them
to
him
two
of
these
contain
the
deeds
maps
and
other
records
you
will
need
she
said
in
a
dead
voice
the
third
contains
the
keys
to
the
houses
and
business
places
each
key
is
tagged
with
the
correct
address
mr
myles
philip
said
he
looked
around
the
room
intending
to
say
to
zarathustra
but
zarathustra
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
finally
he
went
into
the
hall
opened
the
front
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
night
a
full
moon
was
rising
in
the
east
he
walked
down
the
moonlit
walk
climbed
into
his
car
and
threw
his
brief
case
and
the
manila
envelopes
into
the
back
seat
soon
valleyview
was
far
behind
him
but
not
as
far
as
it
should
have
been
he
could
get
the
green
rose
out
of
his
mind
he
could
get
judith
darrow
out
of
his
mind
either
nor
could
he
exorcise
the
summer
breeze
that
kept
wafting
through
the
crevices
in
his
common
sense
a
green
rose
and
a
grass
widow
and
a
breeze
with
a
green
breath
a
whole
town
taking
off
for
greener
pastures
he
reached
into
his
coat
pocket
and
touched
the
rose
it
was
no
more
than
a
stem
and
a
handful
of
petals
now
but
its
reality
could
not
be
denied
but
roses
do
not
bloom
in
autumn
and
green
roses
do
not
bloom
at
all
ruf
he
had
turned
into
the
new
highway
some
time
ago
and
was
driving
along
it
at
a
brisk
now
disbelievingly
he
slowed
and
pulled
over
onto
the
shoulder
sure
enough
he
had
a
stowaway
in
the
back
seat
a
stowaway
with
golden
eyes
ears
and
a
restless
tail
zarathustra
he
gasped
how
in
the
dickens
did
you
get
in
there
ruf
zarathustra
replied
philip
groaned
now
he
would
have
to
go
all
the
way
back
to
valleyview
now
he
would
have
to
see
judith
darrow
again
now
he
would
have
to
he
paused
in
midthought
astonished
at
the
abrupt
acceleration
of
his
heartbeat
well
i
be
damned
he
said
and
without
further
preamble
transferred
zarathustra
to
the
front
seat
and
started
back
the
gasoline
lantern
had
been
moved
out
of
the
window
but
a
light
still
showed
beyond
the
panes
he
pulled
over
to
the
curb
and
turned
off
the
ignition
he
gave
one
of
zarathustra
ears
a
playful
tug
absently
noting
a
series
of
small
nodules
along
its
lower
extremity
come
on
zarathustra
he
said
i
may
as
well
deliver
you
personally
while
i
at
it
after
locking
the
car
he
started
up
the
walk
zarathustra
at
his
heels
he
knocked
on
the
front
door
presently
he
knocked
again
the
door
creaked
swung
partially
open
he
frowned
had
she
forgotten
to
latch
it
he
wondered
or
had
she
deliberately
left
it
unlatched
so
that
zarathustra
could
get
in
zarathustra
himself
lent
plausibility
to
the
latter
conjecture
by
rising
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
pushing
the
door
the
rest
of
the
way
open
with
his
forepaws
after
which
he
trotted
into
the
hall
and
disappeared
philip
pounded
on
the
panels
miss
darrow
he
called
judith
no
answer
he
called
again
still
no
answer
a
summer
breeze
came
traipsing
out
of
the
house
and
engulfed
him
in
the
scent
of
roses
what
kind
of
roses
he
wondered
green
ones
he
stepped
into
the
hall
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
he
made
his
way
into
the
living
room
the
two
chairs
were
gone
and
so
was
the
coffee
table
he
walked
through
the
living
room
and
into
the
library
through
the
library
and
into
the
dining
room
the
gasoline
lantern
burned
brightly
on
the
table
its
harsh
white
light
bathing
bare
floors
and
naked
walls
the
breeze
was
stronger
here
the
scent
of
roses
almost
cloying
he
saw
then
that
the
double
door
that
had
thwarted
him
that
morning
was
open
and
he
moved
toward
it
across
the
room
as
he
had
suspected
it
gave
access
to
the
kitchen
pausing
on
the
threshold
he
peered
inside
it
was
an
ordinary
enough
kitchen
some
of
the
appliances
were
gone
but
the
stove
and
the
refrigerator
were
still
there
the
back
doorway
had
an
odd
bluish
cast
that
caused
the
framework
to
shimmer
the
door
itself
was
open
and
he
could
see
starlight
lying
softly
on
fields
and
trees
wonderingly
he
walked
across
the
room
and
stepped
outside
there
was
a
faint
sputtering
sound
as
though
live
wires
had
been
crossed
and
for
a
fleeting
second
the
scene
before
him
seemed
to
waver
then
abruptly
it
grew
still
he
grew
still
too
immobile
in
the
strange
yet
peaceful
summer
night
he
was
standing
on
a
grassy
plain
and
the
plain
spread
out
on
either
hand
to
promontories
of
little
trees
before
him
the
land
sloped
gently
upward
and
was
covered
with
multicolored
flowers
that
twinkled
like
microcosmic
stars
in
the
distance
the
lights
of
a
village
showed
to
his
right
a
riotous
bush
bloomed
and
beneath
it
zarathustra
sat
wagging
his
tail
philip
took
two
steps
forward
stopped
and
looked
up
at
the
sky
it
was
wrong
somehow
for
one
thing
cassiopeia
had
changed
position
and
for
another
orion
was
awry
for
still
another
there
were
no
clouds
for
the
moon
to
hide
behind
and
yet
the
moon
had
disappeared
zarathustra
trotted
over
to
where
he
was
standing
gazed
up
at
him
with
golden
eyes
then
headed
in
the
direction
of
the
lights
philip
took
a
deep
breath
and
followed
him
he
would
have
visited
the
village
anyway
zarathustra
or
no
zarathustra
was
it
pfleugersville
he
knew
suddenly
that
it
was
he
had
not
gone
far
before
he
saw
a
highway
a
pair
of
headlights
appeared
suddenly
in
the
direction
of
the
village
and
resolved
rapidly
into
a
moving
van
to
his
consternation
the
van
turned
off
the
thoroughfare
and
headed
in
his
direction
he
ducked
into
a
coppice
zarathustra
at
his
heels
and
watched
the
heavy
vehicle
bounce
by
there
were
two
men
in
the
cab
and
painted
on
the
paneling
of
the
truckbed
were
the
words
pfleugersville
movers
inc
the
van
continued
on
in
the
direction
from
which
he
had
come
and
presently
he
guessed
its
destination
judith
clearly
was
in
the
midst
of
moving
out
the
furniture
she
had
been
too
sentimental
to
sell
the
only
trouble
was
her
house
had
disappeared
so
had
the
village
of
valleyview
he
stared
at
where
the
houses
should
have
been
saw
nothing
at
first
except
a
continuation
of
the
starlit
plain
then
he
noticed
an
upright
rectangle
of
pale
light
hovering
just
above
the
ground
and
presently
he
identified
it
as
judith
back
doorway
he
could
see
through
it
into
the
kitchen
and
by
straining
his
eyes
he
could
even
see
the
stove
and
the
refrigerator
gradually
he
made
out
other
upright
rectangles
hovering
just
above
the
ground
some
of
them
on
a
line
with
judith
all
of
them
however
while
outlined
in
the
same
shimmering
blue
that
outlined
hers
lacked
lighted
interiors
as
he
stood
there
staring
the
van
came
to
a
halt
turned
around
and
backed
up
to
the
brightest
rectangle
hiding
it
from
view
the
two
men
got
out
of
the
cab
and
walked
around
to
the
rear
of
the
truckbed
put
the
stove
on
first
philip
heard
one
of
them
say
and
then
wonder
why
she
wants
to
hang
onto
junk
like
this
the
other
man
voice
was
fainter
but
his
words
were
unmistakable
enough
grass
widows
who
turn
into
old
maids
have
funny
notions
sometimes
judith
darrow
was
really
moving
out
of
valleyview
after
all
she
only
thought
she
was
philip
went
on
the
breeze
was
all
around
him
it
blew
through
his
hair
kissed
his
cheeks
and
caressed
his
forehead
the
stars
shone
palely
down
some
of
the
land
was
under
cultivation
and
he
could
see
green
things
growing
in
the
starlight
and
the
breeze
carried
their
green
breath
to
his
nostrils
he
reached
the
highway
and
began
walking
along
it
he
saw
no
further
sign
of
vehicles
till
he
came
opposite
a
large
brick
building
with
bright
light
spilling
through
its
windows
in
front
of
it
were
parked
a
dozen
automobiles
of
a
make
that
he
was
unfamiliar
with
he
heard
the
whir
of
machinery
and
the
pounding
of
hammers
and
he
went
over
and
peered
through
one
of
the
windows
the
building
proved
to
be
a
furniture
factory
most
of
the
work
was
being
done
by
machines
but
there
were
enough
tasks
left
over
to
keep
the
owners
of
the
parked
cars
busily
occupied
the
main
manual
task
was
upholstering
the
machines
cut
and
sewed
and
trimmed
and
planed
and
doweled
and
assembled
but
apparently
none
of
them
was
up
to
the
fine
art
of
spitting
tacks
philip
returned
to
the
highway
and
went
on
he
came
to
other
buildings
and
peered
into
each
one
was
a
small
plant
another
was
a
dairy
a
third
was
a
long
greenhouse
in
the
first
two
the
preponderance
of
the
work
was
being
performed
by
machines
in
the
third
however
machines
were
conspicuously
absent
clearly
it
was
one
thing
to
build
a
machine
with
a
superhuman
work
potential
but
quite
another
to
build
one
with
a
green
thumb
illustration
he
passed
a
pasture
and
saw
animals
that
looked
like
cows
sleeping
in
the
starlight
he
passed
a
field
of
corn
he
passed
a
power
plant
and
heard
the
whine
of
a
generator
finally
he
came
to
the
outskirts
of
pfleugersville
there
was
a
big
illuminated
sign
by
the
side
of
the
road
it
stopped
him
in
his
tracks
and
he
stood
there
staring
at
its
embossed
letters
pfleugersville
sirius
xxi
april
incorporated
september
philip
wiped
his
forehead
zarathustra
had
trotted
on
ahead
now
he
stopped
and
looked
back
he
seemed
to
say
that
you
seen
this
much
you
might
as
well
see
the
so
philip
entered
pfleugersville
and
fell
in
love
fell
in
love
with
the
lovely
houses
and
the
darling
trees
in
summer
bloom
with
the
parterres
of
twinkling
and
the
expanses
of
verdant
lawns
with
the
trellised
green
roses
that
tapestried
every
porch
with
the
hydrangealike
blooms
that
garnished
every
corner
with
pfleugersville
itself
obviously
the
hour
was
late
for
other
than
himself
there
was
no
one
on
the
streets
although
lights
burned
in
the
windows
of
some
of
the
houses
and
dogs
of
the
same
breed
and
size
as
zarathustra
occasionally
trotted
by
and
yet
according
to
his
watch
the
time
was
maybe
though
pfleugersville
was
on
different
time
maybe
here
in
pfleugersville
it
was
the
middle
of
the
night
the
farther
he
progressed
into
the
village
the
more
enchanted
he
became
he
simply
could
get
over
the
houses
the
difference
between
them
and
the
houses
he
was
familiar
with
was
subtle
but
it
was
there
it
was
the
difference
that
exists
between
and
taste
here
were
no
standardized
patios
but
little
marble
aprons
that
were
as
much
a
part
of
the
architecture
as
a
glen
is
a
part
of
a
woods
here
were
no
stereotyped
picture
windows
but
walls
that
blended
imperceptibly
into
pleasing
patterns
of
transparency
here
were
no
back
yards
but
rambling
playgrounds
with
swings
and
seesaws
and
shaded
swimming
holes
with
exquisite
doghouses
good
enough
for
little
girls
dolls
to
live
in
he
passed
a
school
that
seemed
to
grow
out
of
the
very
ground
it
stood
on
he
passed
a
library
that
had
been
built
around
a
huge
tree
the
branches
of
which
had
intertwined
their
foliage
into
a
living
roof
he
passed
a
supermarket
built
of
tinted
glass
finally
he
came
to
the
park
he
gasped
then
gasped
at
the
delicate
trees
and
the
little
lakes
at
the
and
the
winding
pebbled
paths
shed
their
multicolored
radiance
everywhere
and
starlight
poured
prodigally
down
from
the
sky
he
chose
a
path
at
random
and
walked
along
it
in
the
twofold
radiance
till
he
came
to
the
cynosure
the
cynosure
was
a
statue
a
statue
of
a
youth
gazing
steadfastly
up
into
the
heavens
in
one
hand
the
youth
held
a
phillips
screw
driver
in
the
other
a
crescent
wrench
standing
several
yards
away
and
staring
raptly
up
into
the
statue
face
was
the
youth
himself
and
so
immobile
was
he
that
if
it
had
been
for
the
pedestal
on
which
the
statue
rested
philip
would
have
been
unable
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other
there
was
an
inscription
on
the
pedestal
he
walked
over
and
read
it
in
the
light
cast
by
a
nearby
parterre
of
francis
farnsworth
pfleuger
discoverer
of
pfleugersville
may
died
inventor
on
the
first
day
of
april
of
the
year
of
our
lord
francis
farnsworth
pfleuger
brought
into
being
a
m√∂bius
coincidence
field
and
established
multiple
contact
with
the
satellite
of
the
star
sirius
thereby
giving
the
people
of
valleyview
access
via
their
back
doorways
to
a
new
world
here
we
have
come
to
live
here
we
have
come
to
raise
our
children
here
in
this
idyllic
village
which
the
noble
race
that
once
inhabited
this
fair
planet
left
behind
them
when
they
migrated
to
the
greater
magellanic
cloud
we
have
settled
down
to
create
a
new
and
better
way
of
life
here
thanks
to
francis
farnsworth
pfleuger
we
shall
know
happiness
prosperity
and
freedom
from
francis
farnsworth
pfleuger
we
the
new
inhabitants
of
sirius
xxi
salute
you
philip
wiped
his
forehead
again
presently
he
noticed
that
the
francis
pfleuger
was
looking
in
his
direction
me
the
francis
pfleuger
said
pointing
proudly
at
the
statue
me
so
i
gather
philip
said
dryly
and
then
zarathustra
come
back
here
the
little
dog
had
started
down
one
of
the
paths
that
converged
on
the
statue
at
philip
command
he
stopped
but
did
not
turn
instead
he
remained
where
he
was
as
though
waiting
for
someone
to
come
down
the
path
after
a
moment
someone
did
judith
darrow
she
was
wearing
a
simple
white
dress
reminiscent
both
in
design
and
d√©cor
of
a
grecian
tunic
a
wide
gilt
belt
augmented
the
effect
and
her
delicate
sandals
did
nothing
to
mar
it
in
the
radiance
of
the
her
eyes
were
more
gray
than
green
there
were
shadows
under
them
philip
noticed
and
the
lids
were
faintly
red
she
halted
a
few
feet
from
him
and
looked
at
him
without
saying
a
word
i
i
brought
your
dog
back
he
said
lamely
i
found
him
in
the
back
seat
of
my
car
thank
you
i
been
looking
all
over
pfleugersville
for
him
i
left
my
valleyview
doors
open
hoping
he
come
home
of
his
own
accord
but
i
guess
he
had
other
ideas
now
that
you
discovered
our
secret
myles
what
do
you
think
of
our
brave
new
world
i
think
it
lovely
philip
said
but
i
do
believe
it
where
you
seem
to
think
it
is
do
you
she
asked
then
suppose
you
show
me
the
full
moon
that
rose
over
valleyview
tonight
or
better
yet
suppose
i
show
you
something
else
she
pointed
to
a
region
of
the
heavens
just
to
the
left
of
the
statue
nose
you
ca
see
them
from
here
she
said
but
around
that
insignificant
yellow
star
nine
planets
are
in
orbit
one
of
them
is
earth
but
that
impossible
he
objected
consider
the
distance
in
the
sort
of
space
we
dealing
with
myles
distance
is
not
a
factor
in
m√∂bius
space
as
we
have
come
to
call
it
for
lack
of
a
better
term
any
two
given
points
are
coincidental
regardless
of
how
far
apart
they
may
be
in
space
but
this
becomes
manifest
only
when
a
m√∂bius
is
established
as
you
probably
know
by
now
francis
pfleuger
created
such
a
field
at
the
mention
of
his
name
francis
pfleuger
came
hurrying
over
to
where
they
were
standing
e
he
declared
equals
thank
you
francis
judith
said
then
to
philip
shall
we
walk
they
started
down
one
of
the
converging
paths
zarathustra
bringing
up
the
rear
behind
them
francis
returned
to
his
narcissistic
study
of
himself
in
stone
we
were
neighbors
back
in
valleyview
judith
said
but
i
never
dreamed
he
thought
quite
so
much
of
himself
ever
since
we
put
up
that
statue
last
week
he
been
staring
at
it
night
and
day
sometimes
he
even
brings
his
lunch
with
him
he
seems
to
be
familiar
with
einstein
he
not
really
though
he
memorized
the
equation
in
an
attempt
to
justify
his
new
status
in
life
but
he
has
the
remotest
notion
of
what
it
means
it
ironic
in
a
way
that
pfleugersville
should
have
been
discovered
by
someone
with
an
iq
of
less
than
no
one
with
an
iq
of
less
than
could
create
the
sort
of
field
you
were
talking
about
he
did
create
it
deliberately
he
brought
it
into
being
accidentally
by
means
of
a
machine
he
was
building
to
tie
knots
with
or
at
least
that
what
he
says
but
we
do
know
that
there
was
such
a
machine
because
we
saw
its
fused
parts
in
his
kitchen
and
there
no
question
but
what
it
was
the
source
of
the
field
francis
though
ca
remember
how
he
made
the
parts
or
how
he
put
them
together
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
this
day
he
still
does
understand
what
happened
though
i
have
a
feeling
that
he
knows
more
than
he
lets
on
what
happen
philip
asked
for
a
while
judith
was
silent
then
all
of
us
promised
solemnly
not
to
divulge
our
secret
to
an
outsider
unless
he
was
first
accepted
by
the
group
as
a
whole
she
said
but
thanks
to
my
negligence
you
know
most
of
it
already
so
i
suppose
you
entitled
to
know
the
rest
she
sighed
very
well
i
try
to
explain
when
francis
pfleuger
field
had
come
into
being
something
had
happened
to
the
back
doors
of
valleyview
that
caused
them
to
open
upon
a
planet
which
one
of
the
local
promptly
identified
as
sirius
xxi
the
good
folk
of
valleyview
had
no
idea
of
how
such
a
state
of
affairs
could
exist
to
say
nothing
of
how
it
could
have
come
about
till
one
of
the
scientists
whom
they
asked
to
join
them
as
a
part
of
the
plan
which
they
presently
devised
to
make
their
forthcoming
utopia
came
up
with
a
theory
that
explained
everything
according
to
his
theory
the
distance
between
any
two
planetary
or
bodies
was
curved
in
the
manner
of
a
m√∂bius
strip
a
strip
of
paper
given
a
before
bringing
the
two
ends
together
in
this
case
the
strip
represented
the
distance
from
earth
to
sirius
xxi
earth
was
represented
on
the
strip
by
one
dot
and
sirius
xxi
by
another
and
quite
naturally
the
two
dots
were
an
equal
distance
or
approximately
light
years
apart
this
brought
them
directly
opposite
one
another
one
on
one
side
of
the
strip
the
other
on
the
other
side
but
since
a
m√∂bius
strip
has
only
one
surface
or
side
the
two
dots
were
actually
occupying
the
same
space
at
the
same
time
in
m√∂bius
space
then
earth
and
sirius
xxi
were
coincidental
philip
looked
over
his
shoulder
at
the
little
yellow
sun
twinkling
in
the
sky
common
sense
he
said
tells
me
differently
common
sense
is
a
liar
of
the
first
magnitude
judith
said
it
has
misled
man
ever
since
he
first
climbed
down
from
the
trees
it
was
common
sense
that
inspired
ptolemy
theory
of
cosmogony
it
was
common
sense
that
inspired
the
burning
of
giordano
bruno
the
fact
that
common
sense
indicated
that
light
years
separated
earth
and
sirius
xxi
in
reality
did
prove
that
light
years
separated
them
in
a
form
of
reality
that
was
outside
dominion
m√∂bius
space
and
francis
field
had
demonstrated
as
much
the
nodal
areas
which
it
had
established
however
were
merely
limited
manifestations
of
that
reality
in
other
words
the
field
had
merely
provided
limited
access
to
a
form
of
space
that
had
been
in
existence
all
along
though
why
judith
concluded
our
back
doors
should
have
been
affected
rather
than
our
front
doors
for
example
is
inexplicable
unless
it
was
because
francis
built
the
machine
in
his
kitchen
in
any
event
when
they
did
become
nodal
areas
they
manifested
themselves
on
sirius
xxi
and
the
dogs
in
the
immediate
vicinity
associated
them
with
the
doorways
of
their
departed
masters
and
began
whining
to
be
let
in
their
departed
masters
the
race
that
built
this
village
the
race
that
built
the
factories
and
developed
the
encompassing
farms
a
year
ago
according
to
the
records
they
left
behind
them
they
migrated
to
the
greater
magellanic
cloud
philip
was
indignant
why
did
they
take
their
dogs
with
them
they
could
after
all
they
had
to
leave
their
cars
and
their
furniture
behind
them
too
not
to
mention
almost
unbelievable
stockpiles
of
every
metal
imaginable
that
will
last
us
for
centuries
the
logistics
of
space
travel
make
taking
even
an
extra
handkerchief
along
a
calculated
risk
anyway
when
their
dogs
us
they
were
overjoyed
and
as
for
us
we
fell
in
love
with
them
at
first
sight
our
own
dogs
though
did
take
to
them
at
all
and
every
one
of
them
ran
away
this
ca
be
the
only
village
philip
said
there
must
be
others
somewhere
undoubtedly
there
are
all
we
know
is
that
the
people
who
built
this
one
were
the
last
to
leave
the
park
was
behind
them
now
and
they
were
walking
down
a
pleasant
street
and
when
you
and
your
neighbors
discovered
the
village
did
you
decide
to
become
expatriates
right
then
and
there
philip
asked
she
nodded
do
you
blame
us
you
seen
for
yourself
what
a
lovely
place
it
is
but
it
far
more
than
that
in
valleyview
we
had
unemployment
here
there
is
work
for
everyone
and
a
corresponding
feeling
of
wantedness
and
togetherness
true
most
of
the
work
is
farmwork
but
what
of
that
we
have
every
conceivable
kind
of
machine
to
help
us
in
our
tasks
indeed
i
think
that
the
only
machine
the
sirians
lacked
was
one
that
could
manufacture
food
out
of
whole
cloth
but
consider
the
most
important
advantage
of
all
when
we
go
to
bed
at
night
we
can
do
so
without
being
afraid
that
sometime
during
our
sleep
a
thermonuclear
missile
will
descend
out
of
the
sky
and
devour
us
in
one
huge
incandescent
bite
if
we
made
a
culture
hero
out
of
our
village
idiot
it
no
more
than
right
for
unwittingly
or
not
he
opened
up
the
gates
of
paradise
and
you
immediately
saw
to
it
that
no
one
besides
yourselves
and
a
chosen
few
would
pass
through
them
judith
paused
beside
a
white
gate
yes
that
true
she
said
to
keep
our
secret
we
lived
in
our
old
houses
while
we
were
settling
our
affairs
closing
down
our
few
industries
and
setting
up
a
new
monetary
system
in
fact
we
even
kept
our
the
children
in
the
dark
for
fear
that
they
would
talk
at
school
suppose
however
we
publicized
our
utopia
ca
you
imagine
the
mockery
opportunists
would
have
made
out
of
it
the
village
we
found
was
large
enough
to
accommodate
ourselves
and
the
few
friends
relatives
and
specialists
we
asked
to
join
us
but
no
larger
and
we
did
after
all
find
it
in
our
own
back
yard
she
placed
her
hand
on
the
white
gate
this
is
where
i
live
he
looked
at
the
house
and
it
was
enchanting
slightly
less
enchanting
but
delightful
in
its
own
right
was
the
much
smaller
house
beside
it
judith
pointed
toward
the
latter
dwelling
and
looked
at
zarathustra
it
almost
morning
zarathustra
she
said
sternly
go
to
bed
this
minute
she
opened
the
gate
so
that
the
little
dog
could
pass
through
and
raised
her
eyes
to
philip
our
time
is
different
here
she
explained
and
then
i
afraid
you
have
to
hurry
if
you
expect
to
make
it
to
my
back
door
before
the
field
dies
out
illustration
he
felt
suddenly
empty
dies
out
he
repeated
numbly
yes
we
do
know
why
but
it
been
diminishing
in
strength
ever
since
it
first
came
into
being
and
our
scientist
has
predicted
that
it
will
cease
to
exist
during
the
next
hours
i
guess
i
do
need
to
remind
you
that
you
have
important
business
on
earth
no
he
said
i
guess
you
do
his
emptiness
bowed
out
before
a
wave
of
bitterness
he
had
rested
his
hand
on
the
gate
as
close
to
hers
as
he
had
dared
now
he
saw
that
while
it
was
inches
away
from
hers
in
one
sense
it
was
light
years
away
in
another
he
removed
it
angrily
business
always
comes
first
with
you
does
it
yes
business
never
lets
you
down
do
you
know
what
i
think
philip
said
i
think
that
you
were
the
one
who
did
the
selling
out
not
your
husband
i
think
you
sold
him
out
for
a
law
practice
her
face
turned
white
as
though
he
had
slapped
it
and
in
a
sense
he
had
she
said
and
this
time
he
was
certain
that
if
he
were
to
reach
out
and
touch
her
she
would
shatter
into
a
million
pieces
give
my
love
to
the
planet
earth
she
added
icily
philip
said
his
anger
gone
now
and
the
emptiness
rushing
back
do
sell
us
short
though
we
make
a
big
splash
in
your
sky
one
of
these
days
when
we
blow
ourselves
up
illustration
he
turned
and
walked
away
walked
out
of
the
enchanting
village
and
down
the
highway
and
across
the
plain
to
judith
back
doorway
it
was
unlighted
now
and
he
had
trouble
distinguishing
it
from
the
others
its
shimmering
blue
framework
was
flickering
judith
had
not
lied
then
the
field
was
dying
out
he
locked
the
back
door
behind
him
walked
sadly
through
the
dark
and
empty
house
and
let
himself
out
the
front
door
he
locked
the
front
door
behind
him
too
and
went
down
the
walk
and
climbed
into
his
car
he
had
thought
he
had
locked
it
but
apparently
he
had
he
drove
out
of
town
and
down
the
road
to
the
highway
and
down
the
highway
toward
the
big
bright
bonfire
of
the
city
dawn
was
exploring
the
eastern
sky
with
pale
pink
fingers
when
at
last
he
parked
his
car
in
the
garage
behind
his
apartment
building
he
reached
into
the
back
seat
for
his
brief
case
and
the
manila
envelopes
his
brief
case
had
hair
on
it
it
was
soft
and
warm
ruf
it
barked
he
knew
then
that
everything
was
all
right
just
because
no
one
had
invited
him
to
the
party
did
mean
that
he
could
invite
himself
he
would
have
to
hurry
though
he
had
a
lot
of
things
to
do
and
time
was
running
out
noon
found
him
on
the
highway
again
his
business
transacted
his
affairs
settled
zarathustra
sitting
beside
him
on
the
seat
one
found
him
driving
into
valleyview
found
him
turning
down
a
familiar
street
he
would
have
to
leave
his
car
behind
him
but
that
was
all
right
leaving
it
to
rust
away
in
a
ghost
town
was
better
than
selling
it
to
some
opportunistic
dealer
for
a
sum
he
would
have
no
use
for
anyway
he
parked
it
by
the
curb
and
after
getting
his
suitcase
out
of
the
trunk
walked
up
to
the
front
door
of
number
he
unlocked
and
opened
the
door
and
after
zarathustra
followed
him
inside
closed
and
locked
it
behind
him
he
strode
through
the
house
to
the
kitchen
he
unlocked
and
opened
the
back
door
he
stepped
eagerly
across
the
threshold
and
stopped
dead
still
there
were
boards
beneath
his
feet
instead
of
grass
instead
of
a
plain
he
saw
a
series
of
unkempt
back
yards
beside
him
on
an
unpainted
trellis
virginia
creeper
rattled
in
an
october
wind
zarathustra
came
out
behind
him
descended
the
steps
and
ran
around
the
side
of
the
house
looking
for
the
bush
probably
ruf
zarathustra
had
returned
and
was
looking
up
at
him
from
the
bottom
step
on
the
top
step
he
had
placed
an
offering
the
offering
was
a
green
rose
philip
bent
down
and
picked
it
up
it
was
fresh
and
its
fragrance
epitomized
the
very
essence
of
sirius
xxi
zarathustra
he
gasped
where
did
you
get
it
ruf
said
zarathustra
and
ran
around
the
side
of
the
house
philip
followed
rounded
the
corner
just
in
time
to
see
the
tail
disappear
into
the
ancient
dog
house
disappointment
numbed
him
that
was
where
the
rose
had
been
then
stored
away
for
like
an
old
and
worthless
bone
but
the
rose
was
fresh
he
reminded
himself
did
dog
houses
have
back
doorways
this
one
did
he
saw
kneeling
down
and
peering
inside
a
lovely
back
doorway
rimmed
with
shimmering
blue
it
framed
a
familiar
vista
in
the
foreground
of
which
a
familiar
stood
beneath
the
rosebush
zarathustra
sat
wagging
his
tail
it
was
a
tight
squeeze
but
philip
made
it
he
even
managed
to
get
his
suitcase
through
and
just
in
time
too
for
hardly
had
he
done
so
when
the
doorway
began
to
flicker
now
it
was
on
its
way
out
and
as
he
watched
it
faded
into
transparency
and
disappeared
he
crawled
from
beneath
the
rosebush
and
stood
up
the
day
was
bright
and
warm
and
the
position
of
the
sun
indicated
early
morning
or
late
afternoon
no
not
sun
suns
one
of
them
was
a
brilliant
orb
the
other
a
twinkling
point
of
light
he
set
off
across
the
plain
in
zarathustra
wake
he
had
a
speech
already
prepared
and
when
judith
met
him
at
the
gate
with
wide
and
wondering
eyes
he
delivered
it
without
preamble
judith
he
said
i
am
contemptuous
of
the
notion
that
some
things
are
meant
to
be
and
others
are
and
i
firmly
believe
in
my
own
free
will
but
when
your
dog
stows
away
in
the
back
seat
of
my
car
two
times
running
and
makes
it
impossible
for
me
not
to
see
you
again
then
there
must
be
something
afoot
which
neither
you
nor
i
can
do
a
thing
about
whatever
it
is
i
have
given
in
to
it
and
have
transferred
your
real
estate
to
an
agent
more
trustworthy
than
myself
i
know
you
have
known
me
long
and
i
know
i
not
an
accepted
member
of
your
group
but
maybe
somebody
will
give
me
a
job
raking
lawns
or
washing
windows
or
hoeing
corn
long
enough
for
me
to
prove
that
i
am
not
in
the
least
antisocial
and
maybe
in
time
you
yourself
will
get
to
know
me
well
enough
to
realize
that
while
i
have
a
weakness
for
blondes
who
look
like
grecian
goddesses
i
have
no
taste
whatever
for
redheads
brunettes
or
cutty
sark
in
any
event
i
have
burned
my
bridges
behind
me
and
whether
i
ever
become
a
resident
of
pfleugersville
or
not
i
have
already
become
a
resident
of
sirius
xxi
judith
darrow
was
silent
for
some
time
then
this
morning
she
said
i
wanted
to
ask
you
to
join
us
but
i
could
for
two
reasons
the
first
was
your
commitment
to
sell
our
houses
the
second
was
my
bitterness
toward
men
you
have
eliminated
the
first
and
the
second
seems
suddenly
inane
she
raised
her
eyes
philip
please
join
us
i
want
you
to
zarathustra
whose
real
name
was
siddenon
phenphonderill
left
them
standing
there
in
each
other
arms
and
trotted
down
the
street
and
out
of
town
he
covered
the
ground
in
easy
lopes
that
belied
his
three
hundred
and
years
and
soon
he
arrived
at
the
meeting
place
the
mayors
of
the
other
villages
had
been
awaiting
him
since
early
morning
and
were
shifting
impatiently
on
their
haunches
when
he
clambered
up
on
the
rostrum
they
extended
their
and
retractile
fingers
and
accorded
him
a
round
of
applause
he
extended
his
own
hands
and
held
them
up
for
silence
then
retracting
them
again
he
seated
himself
before
the
little
lectern
and
began
his
report
the
idiomatic
translation
of
which
follows
forthwith
gentlemen
my
apologies
for
my
late
arrival
i
will
touch
upon
the
circumstances
that
were
responsible
for
it
presently
to
get
down
to
the
matter
uppermost
in
your
minds
yes
the
experiment
was
a
success
and
if
you
will
use
your
powers
to
remodel
your
villages
along
the
lines
my
constituents
and
i
remodeled
ours
and
to
build
enough
factories
to
give
your
that
sense
of
so
essential
to
their
and
if
you
will
your
disassembled
multiple
dynamos
in
such
a
way
that
the
resultant
fields
will
be
ascribed
to
accidental
causes
you
will
have
no
more
trouble
attracting
personnel
than
we
did
just
make
sure
that
your
quarters
are
superior
to
your
own
and
that
you
behave
like
dogs
in
their
presence
and
when
you
fabricate
your
records
concerning
your
mythical
departed
masters
see
to
it
that
they
do
not
conflict
with
the
records
we
fabricated
concerning
ours
it
would
be
desirable
indeed
if
our
society
could
be
based
on
less
deceitful
grounds
than
these
but
the
very
human
attitude
we
are
exploiting
renders
this
impossible
at
the
moment
i
hate
to
think
of
the
resentment
we
would
incur
were
we
to
reveal
that
far
from
being
the
mere
dogs
we
seem
to
be
we
are
capable
of
mentally
transmuting
natural
resources
into
virtually
anything
from
a
key
to
a
concert
hall
and
i
hate
even
more
to
think
of
the
resentment
we
would
incur
were
we
to
reveal
that
for
all
our
ability
in
the
inanimate
field
we
have
never
been
able
to
materialize
so
much
as
a
single
blade
of
grass
in
the
animate
field
and
that
our
reason
for
coincidentalizing
the
planet
earth
and
creating
our
irresistible
little
utopias
stems
not
from
a
need
for
companionship
but
from
a
need
for
gardeners
however
you
will
find
that
all
of
this
can
be
ironed
out
eventually
through
the
human
children
with
whom
you
will
be
thrown
into
daily
contact
and
whom
you
will
find
to
possess
all
of
their
parents
abiding
love
for
us
and
none
of
their
parents
superior
attitude
toward
us
to
a
little
child
a
dog
is
a
companion
not
a
pet
an
equal
not
an
inferior
and
the
little
children
of
today
will
be
the
of
tomorrow
to
return
to
the
circumstances
that
occasioned
my
late
arrival
i
i
must
confess
gentlemen
that
i
became
quite
attached
to
the
into
whose
house
i
sought
entry
when
we
first
established
our
field
and
who
subsequently
adopted
me
when
i
convinced
her
real
dog
that
he
would
find
greener
pastures
elsewhere
so
greatly
attached
did
i
become
in
fact
that
when
the
opportunity
of
ostracizing
her
loneliness
presented
itself
i
could
not
refrain
from
taking
advantage
of
it
the
person
to
whom
she
was
most
suited
and
who
was
most
suited
to
her
appeared
virtually
upon
her
very
doorstep
but
in
her
stubbornness
and
in
her
pride
she
aggravated
rather
than
encouraged
him
causing
him
to
rebel
against
the
natural
attraction
he
felt
toward
her
i
am
happy
to
report
that
by
means
of
a
number
of
subterfuges
the
final
one
of
which
necessitated
the
use
of
our
original
doorway
i
was
able
to
set
this
matter
right
and
that
these
two
people
are
about
to
embark
upon
a
relationship
which
in
their
folklore
is
oftentimes
quaintly
alluded
to
by
the
words
lived
happily
ever
after
and
now
gentlemen
the
best
of
luck
to
you
and
your
constituents
and
may
you
end
up
with
servants
as
excellent
as
ours
