an
affectionate
remembrance
from
the
author
honorine
if
the
french
have
as
great
an
aversion
for
traveling
as
the
english
have
a
propensity
for
it
both
english
and
french
have
perhaps
sufficient
reasons
something
better
than
england
is
everywhere
to
be
found
whereas
it
is
excessively
difficult
to
find
the
charms
of
france
outside
france
other
countries
can
show
admirable
scenery
and
they
frequently
offer
greater
comfort
than
that
of
france
which
makes
but
slow
progress
in
that
particular
they
sometimes
display
a
bewildering
magnificence
grandeur
and
luxury
they
lack
neither
grace
nor
noble
manners
but
the
life
of
the
brain
the
talent
for
conversation
the
attic
salt
so
familiar
at
paris
the
prompt
apprehension
of
what
one
is
thinking
but
does
not
say
the
spirit
of
the
unspoken
which
is
half
the
french
language
is
nowhere
else
to
be
met
with
hence
a
frenchman
whose
raillery
as
it
is
finds
so
little
comprehension
would
wither
in
a
foreign
land
like
an
uprooted
tree
emigration
is
counter
to
the
instincts
of
the
french
nation
many
frenchmen
of
the
kind
here
in
question
have
owned
to
pleasure
at
seeing
the
officers
of
their
native
land
which
may
seem
the
most
daring
hyperbole
of
patriotism
this
preamble
is
intended
to
recall
to
such
frenchmen
as
have
traveled
the
extreme
pleasure
they
have
felt
on
occasionally
finding
their
native
land
like
an
oasis
in
the
of
some
diplomate
a
pleasure
hard
to
be
understood
by
those
who
have
never
left
the
asphalt
of
the
boulevard
des
italiens
and
to
whom
the
quais
of
the
left
bank
of
the
seine
are
not
really
paris
to
find
paris
again
do
you
know
what
that
means
o
parisians
it
is
to
find
not
indeed
the
cookery
of
the
de
as
borel
elaborates
it
for
those
who
can
appreciate
it
for
that
exists
only
in
the
rue
montorgueil
but
a
meal
which
reminds
you
of
it
it
is
to
find
the
wines
of
france
which
out
of
france
are
to
be
regarded
as
myths
and
as
rare
as
the
woman
of
whom
i
write
it
is
to
find
not
the
most
fashionable
pleasantry
for
it
loses
its
aroma
between
paris
and
the
frontier
but
the
witty
understanding
the
critical
atmosphere
in
which
the
french
live
from
the
poet
down
to
the
artisan
from
the
duchess
to
the
boy
in
the
street
in
when
the
sardinian
court
was
residing
at
genoa
two
parisians
more
or
less
famous
could
fancy
themselves
still
in
paris
when
they
found
themselves
in
a
palazzo
taken
by
the
french
on
the
hill
forming
the
last
fold
of
the
apennines
between
the
gate
of
san
tomaso
and
the
lighthouse
which
is
to
be
seen
in
all
the
keepsake
views
of
genoa
this
palazzo
is
one
of
the
magnificent
villas
on
which
genoese
nobles
were
wont
to
spend
millions
at
the
time
when
the
aristocratic
republic
was
a
power
if
the
early
night
is
beautiful
anywhere
it
surely
is
at
genoa
after
it
has
rained
as
it
can
rain
there
in
torrents
all
the
morning
when
the
clearness
of
the
sea
vies
with
that
of
the
sky
when
silence
reigns
on
the
quay
and
in
the
groves
of
the
villa
and
over
the
marble
heads
with
yawning
jaws
from
which
water
mysteriously
flows
when
the
stars
are
beaming
when
the
waves
of
the
mediterranean
lap
one
after
another
like
the
avowal
of
a
woman
from
whom
you
drag
it
word
by
word
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
moment
when
the
perfumed
air
brings
fragrance
to
the
lungs
and
to
our
when
voluptuousness
made
visible
and
ambient
as
the
air
holds
you
in
your
when
a
spoon
in
your
hand
you
sip
an
ice
or
a
sorbet
the
town
at
your
feet
and
fair
woman
opposite
such
boccaccio
hours
can
be
known
only
in
italy
and
on
the
shores
of
the
mediterranean
imagine
to
yourself
round
the
table
the
marquis
di
negro
a
knight
hospitaller
to
all
men
of
talent
on
their
travels
and
the
marquis
damaso
pareto
two
frenchmen
disguised
as
genoese
a
with
a
wife
as
beautiful
as
a
madonna
and
two
silent
children
silent
because
sleep
has
fallen
on
them
the
french
ambassador
and
his
wife
a
secretary
to
the
embassy
who
believes
himself
to
be
crushed
and
mischievous
finally
two
parisians
who
have
come
to
take
leave
of
the
consul
s
wife
at
a
splendid
dinner
and
you
will
have
the
picture
presented
by
the
terrace
of
the
villa
about
the
middle
of
may
a
picture
in
which
the
predominant
figure
was
that
of
a
celebrated
woman
on
whom
all
eyes
centered
now
and
again
the
heroine
of
this
improvised
festival
one
of
the
two
frenchmen
was
the
famous
landscape
painter
leon
de
lora
the
other
a
well
known
critic
claude
vignon
they
had
both
come
with
this
lady
one
of
the
glories
of
the
fair
sex
mademoiselle
des
touches
known
in
the
literary
world
by
the
name
of
camille
maupin
mademoiselle
des
touches
had
been
to
florence
on
business
with
the
charming
kindness
of
which
she
is
prodigal
she
had
brought
with
her
leon
de
lora
to
show
him
italy
and
had
gone
on
as
far
as
rome
that
he
might
see
the
campagna
she
had
come
by
simplon
and
was
returning
by
the
cornice
road
to
marseilles
she
had
stopped
at
genoa
again
on
the
landscape
painter
s
account
the
had
of
course
wished
to
do
the
honors
of
genoa
before
the
arrival
of
the
court
to
a
woman
whose
wealth
name
and
position
recommend
her
no
less
than
her
talents
camille
maupin
who
knew
her
genoa
down
to
its
smallest
chapels
had
left
her
landscape
painter
to
the
care
of
the
diplomate
and
the
two
genoese
marquises
and
was
miserly
of
her
minutes
though
the
ambassador
was
a
distinguished
man
of
letters
the
celebrated
lady
had
refused
to
yield
to
his
advances
dreading
what
the
english
call
an
exhibition
but
she
had
drawn
in
the
claws
of
her
refusals
when
it
was
proposed
that
they
should
spend
a
farewell
day
at
the
consul
s
villa
leon
de
lora
had
told
camille
that
her
presence
at
the
villa
was
the
only
return
he
could
make
to
the
ambassador
and
his
wife
the
two
genoese
noblemen
the
consul
and
his
wife
so
mademoiselle
des
touches
had
sacrificed
one
of
those
days
of
perfect
freedom
which
are
not
always
to
be
had
in
paris
by
those
on
whom
the
world
has
its
eye
now
the
meeting
being
accounted
for
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
etiquette
had
been
banished
as
well
as
a
great
many
women
even
of
the
highest
rank
who
were
curious
to
know
whether
camille
maupin
s
manly
talent
impaired
her
grace
as
a
pretty
woman
and
to
see
in
a
word
whether
the
trousers
showed
below
her
petticoats
after
dinner
till
nine
o
clock
when
a
collation
was
served
though
the
conversation
had
been
gay
and
grave
by
turns
and
constantly
enlivened
by
leon
de
lora
s
sallies
for
he
is
considered
the
most
roguish
wit
of
paris
and
by
the
good
taste
which
will
surprise
no
one
after
the
list
of
guests
literature
had
scarcely
been
mentioned
however
the
butterfly
flittings
of
this
french
tilting
match
were
certain
to
come
to
it
were
it
only
to
flutter
over
this
essentially
french
subject
but
before
coming
to
the
turn
in
the
conversation
which
led
the
to
speak
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
to
give
some
account
of
him
and
his
family
this
diplomate
a
man
of
who
had
been
married
about
six
years
was
the
living
portrait
of
lord
byron
the
familiarity
of
that
face
makes
a
description
of
the
consul
s
unnecessary
it
may
however
be
noted
that
there
was
no
affectation
in
his
dreamy
expression
lord
byron
was
a
poet
and
the
consul
was
poetical
women
know
and
recognize
the
difference
which
explains
without
justifying
some
of
their
attachments
his
handsome
face
thrown
into
relief
by
a
delightful
nature
had
captivated
a
genoese
heiress
a
genoese
heiress
the
expression
might
raise
a
smile
at
genoa
where
in
consequence
of
the
inability
of
daughters
to
inherit
a
woman
is
rarely
rich
but
onorina
pedrotti
the
only
child
of
a
banker
without
heirs
male
was
an
exception
notwithstanding
all
the
flattering
advances
prompted
by
a
spontaneous
passion
the
had
not
seemed
to
wish
to
marry
nevertheless
after
living
in
the
town
for
two
years
and
after
certain
steps
taken
by
the
ambassador
during
his
visits
to
the
genoese
court
the
marriage
was
decided
on
the
young
man
withdrew
his
former
refusal
less
on
account
of
the
touching
affection
of
onorina
pedrotti
than
by
reason
of
an
unknown
incident
one
of
those
crises
of
private
life
which
are
so
instantly
buried
under
the
daily
tide
of
interests
that
at
a
subsequent
date
the
most
natural
actions
seem
inexplicable
this
involution
of
causes
sometimes
affects
the
most
serious
events
of
history
this
at
any
rate
was
the
opinion
of
the
town
of
genoa
where
to
some
women
the
extreme
reserve
the
melancholy
of
the
french
consul
could
be
explained
only
by
the
word
passion
it
may
be
remarked
in
passing
that
women
never
complain
of
being
the
victims
of
a
preference
they
are
very
ready
to
immolate
themselves
for
the
common
weal
onorina
pedrotti
who
might
have
hated
the
consul
if
she
had
been
altogether
scorned
loved
her
no
less
and
perhaps
more
when
she
know
that
he
had
loved
women
allow
precedence
in
love
affairs
all
is
well
if
other
women
are
in
question
a
man
is
not
a
diplomate
with
impunity
the
was
as
secret
as
the
grave
so
secret
that
the
merchants
of
genoa
chose
to
regard
the
young
consul
s
attitude
as
premeditated
and
the
heiress
might
perhaps
have
slipped
through
his
fingers
if
he
had
not
played
his
part
of
a
if
it
was
real
the
women
thought
it
too
degrading
to
be
believed
pedrotti
s
daughter
gave
him
her
love
as
a
consolation
she
lulled
these
unknown
griefs
in
a
cradle
of
tenderness
and
italian
caresses
il
signor
pedrotti
had
indeed
no
reason
to
complain
of
the
choice
to
which
he
was
driven
by
his
beloved
child

protectors

over

magnificent
creatures

michael
angelo
took
his
models
in
genoa
for
the
tomb
of
giuliano
hence
the
fulness
and
singular
placing
of
the
breast
in
the
figures
of
day
and
night
which
so
many
critics
have
thought
exaggerated
but
which
is
peculiar
to
the
women
of
liguria
a
genoese
beauty
is
no
longer
to
be
found
excepting
under
the
mezzaro
as
at
venice
it
is
met
with
only
under
the
this
phenomenon
is
observed
among
all
fallen
nations
the
noble
type
survives
only
among
the
populace
as
after
the
burning
of
a
town
coins
are
found
hidden
in
the
ashes
and
onorina
an
exception
as
regards
her
fortune
is
no
less
an
exceptional
patrician
beauty
recall
to
mind
the
figure
of
night
which
michael
angelo
has
placed
at
the
feet
of
the
dress
her
in
modern
garb
twist
that
long
hair
round
the
magnificent
head
a
little
dark
in
complexion
set
a
spark
of
fire
in
those
dreamy
eyes
throw
a
scarf
about
the
massive
bosom
see
the
long
dress
white
embroidered
with
flowers
imagine
the
statue
sitting
upright
with
her
arms
folded
like
those
of
mademoiselle
georges
and
you
will
see
before
you
the
consul
s
wife
with
a
boy
of
six
as
handsome
as
a
mother
s
desire
and
a
little
girl
of
four
on
her
knees
as
beautiful
as
the
type
of
childhood
so
laboriously
sought
out
by
the
sculptor
david
to
grace
a
tomb
this
beautiful
family
was
the
object
of
camille
s
secret
study
it
struck
mademoiselle
des
touches
that
the
consul
looked
rather
too
for
a
perfectly
happy
man
although
throughout
the
day
the
husband
and
wife
had
offered
her
the
pleasing
spectacle
of
complete
happiness
camille
wondered
why
one
of
the
most
superior
men
she
had
ever
met
and
whom
she
had
seen
too
in
paris
remained
as
at
genoa
when
he
possessed
a
fortune
of
a
hundred
odd
thousand
francs
a
year
but
at
the
same
time
she
had
discerned
by
many
of
the
little
nothings
which
women
perceive
with
the
intelligence
of
the
arab
sage
in
that
the
husband
was
faithfully
devoted
these
two
handsome
creatures
would
no
doubt
love
each
other
without
a
misunderstanding
till
the
end
of
their
days
so
camille
said
to
herself
alternately
what
is
wrong
nothing
is
wrong
following
the
misleading
symptoms
of
the
consul
s
demeanor
and
he
it
may
be
said
had
the
absolute
calmness
of
englishmen
of
savages
of
orientals
and
of
consummate
diplomatists
in
discussing
literature
they
spoke
of
the
perennial
of
the
republic
of
letters
woman
s
sin
and
they
presently
found
themselves
confronted
by
two
opinions
when
a
woman
sins
is
the
man
or
the
woman
to
blame
the
three
women
present
the
ambassadress
the
consul
s
wife
and
mademoiselle
des
touches
women
of
course
of
blameless
reputations
were
without
pity
for
the
woman
the
men
tried
to
convince
these
fair
flowers
of
their
sex
that
some
virtues
might
remain
in
a
woman
after
she
had
fallen
how
long
are
we
going
to
play
at
in
this
way
said
leon
de
lora
go
and
put
your
children
to
bed
and
send
me
by
gina
the
little
black
that
lies
on
my
boule
cabinet
said
the
consul
to
his
wife
she
rose
without
a
reply
which
shows
that
she
loved
her
husband
very
truly
for
she
already
knew
french
enough
to
understand
that
her
husband
was
getting
rid
of
her
i
will
tell
you
a
story
in
which
i
played
a
part
and
after
that
we
can
discuss
it
for
it
seems
to
me
childish
to
practise
with
the
scalpel
on
an
imaginary
body
begin
by
dissecting
a
every
one
prepared
to
listen
with
all
the
greater
readiness
because
they
had
all
talked
enough
and
this
is
the
moment
to
be
chosen
for
telling
a
story
this
then
is
the
s
tale
when
i
was
and
had
taken
my
degree
in
law
my
old
uncle
the
abbe
loraux
then
years
old
felt
it
necessary
to
provide
me
with
a
protector
and
to
start
me
in
some
career
this
excellent
man
if
not
indeed
a
saint
regarded
each
year
of
his
life
as
a
fresh
gift
from
god
i
need
not
tell
you
that
the
father
confessor
of
a
royal
highness
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
a
place
for
a
young
man
brought
up
by
himself
his
sister
s
only
child
so
one
day
towards
the
end
of
the
year
this
venerable
old
man
who
for
five
years
had
been
cure
of
the
white
friars
at
paris
came
up
to
the
room
i
had
in
his
house
and
said
get
yourself
dressed
my
dear
boy
i
am
going
to
introduce
you
to
some
one
who
is
willing
to
engage
you
as
secretary
if
i
am
not
mistaken
he
may
fill
my
place
in
the
event
of
god
s
taking
me
to
himself
i
shall
have
finished
mass
at
nine
o
clock
you
have
of
an
hour
before
you
be
what
uncle
must
i
say
to
this
room
where
for
four
years
i
have
been
so
happy
i
have
no
fortune
to
leave
you
said
he
have
you
not
the
reputation
of
your
name
to
leave
me
the
memory
of
your
good
works
we
need
say
nothing
of
that
inheritance
he
replied
smiling
you
do
not
yet
know
enough
of
the
world
to
be
aware
that
a
legacy
of
that
kind
is
hardly
likely
to
be
paid
whereas
by
taking
you
this
morning
to
le
comte
allow
me
said
the
consul
interrupting
himself
to
speak
of
my
protector
by
his
christian
name
only
and
to
call
him
comte
by
taking
you
this
morning
to
le
comte
octave
i
hope
to
secure
you
his
patronage
which
if
you
are
so
fortunate
as
to
please
that
virtuous
statesman
as
i
make
no
doubt
you
can
will
be
worth
at
least
as
much
as
the
fortune
i
might
have
accumulated
for
you
if
my
s
ruin
and
my
sister
s
death
had
not
fallen
on
me
like
a
from
a
clear
are
you
the
count
s
director
if
i
were
could
i
place
you
with
him
what
priest
could
be
capable
of
taking
advantage
of
the
secrets
which
he
learns
at
the
tribunal
of
repentance
no
you
owe
this
position
to
his
highness
the
keeper
of
the
seals
my
dear
maurice
you
will
be
as
much
at
home
there
as
in
your
father
s
house
the
count
will
give
you
a
salary
of
two
thousand
four
hundred
francs
rooms
in
his
house
and
an
allowance
of
twelve
hundred
francs
in
lieu
of
feeding
you
he
will
not
admit
you
to
his
table
nor
give
you
a
separate
table
for
fear
of
leaving
you
to
the
care
of
servants
i
did
not
accept
the
offer
when
it
was
made
to
me
till
i
was
perfectly
certain
that
comte
octave
s
secretary
was
never
to
be
a
mere
upper
servant
you
will
have
an
immense
amount
of
work
for
the
count
is
a
great
worker
but
when
you
leave
him
you
will
be
qualified
to
fill
the
highest
posts
i
need
not
warn
you
to
be
discreet
that
is
the
first
virtue
of
any
man
who
hopes
to
hold
public
you
may
conceive
of
my
curiosity
comte
octave
at
that
time
held
one
of
the
highest
legal
appointments
he
was
in
the
confidence
of
madame
the
dauphiness
who
had
just
got
him
made
a
state
minister
he
led
such
a
life
as
the
comte
de
serizy
whom
you
all
know
i
think
but
even
more
quietly
for
his
house
was
in
the
marais
rue
payenne
and
he
hardly
ever
entertained
his
private
life
escaped
public
comment
by
its
simplicity
and
by
constant
hard
work
let
me
describe
my
position
to
you
in
a
few
words
having
found
in
the
solemn
headmaster
of
the
college
a
tutor
to
whom
my
uncle
delegated
his
authority
at
the
age
of
eighteen
i
had
gone
through
all
the
classes
i
left
school
as
innocent
as
a
seminarist
full
of
faith
on
quitting
my
mother
on
her
deathbed
had
made
my
uncle
promise
that
i
should
not
become
a
priest
but
i
was
as
pious
as
though
i
had
to
take
orders
on
leaving
college
the
abbe
loraux
took
me
into
his
house
and
made
me
study
law
during
the
four
years
of
study
requisite
for
passing
all
the
examinations
i
worked
hard
but
chiefly
at
things
outside
the
arid
fields
of
jurisprudence
weaned
from
literature
as
i
had
been
at
college
where
i
lived
in
the
headmaster
s
house
i
had
a
thirst
to
quench
as
soon
as
i
had
read
a
few
modern
masterpieces
the
works
of
all
the
preceding
ages
were
greedily
swallowed
i
became
crazy
about
the
theatre
and
for
a
long
time
i
went
every
night
to
the
play
though
my
uncle
gave
me
only
a
hundred
francs
a
month
this
parsimony
to
which
the
good
old
man
was
compelled
by
his
regard
for
the
poor
had
the
effect
of
keeping
a
young
man
s
desires
within
reasonable
limits
when
i
went
to
live
with
comte
octave
i
was
not
indeed
an
innocent
but
i
thought
of
my
rare
escapades
as
crimes
my
uncle
was
so
truly
angelic
and
i
was
so
much
afraid
of
grieving
him
that
in
all
those
four
years
i
had
never
spent
a
night
out
the
good
man
would
wait
till
i
came
in
to
go
to
bed
this
maternal
care
had
more
power
to
keep
me
within
bounds
than
the
sermons
and
reproaches
with
which
the
life
of
a
young
man
is
diversified
in
a
puritanical
home
i
was
a
stranger
to
the
various
circles
which
make
up
the
world
of
paris
society
i
only
knew
some
women
of
the
better
sort
and
none
of
the
inferior
class
but
those
i
saw
as
i
walked
about
or
in
the
boxes
at
the
play
and
then
only
from
the
depths
of
the
pit
where
i
sat
if
at
that
period
any
one
had
said
to
me
you
will
see
canalis
or
camille
maupin
i
should
have
felt
hot
coals
in
my
head
and
in
my
bowels
famous
people
were
to
me
as
gods
who
neither
spoke
nor
walked
nor
ate
like
other
mortals
how
many
tales
of
the
nights
are
comprehended
in
the
ripening
of
a
youth
how
many
wonderful
lamps
must
we
have
rubbed
before
we
understand
that
the
true
wonderful
lamp
is
either
luck
or
work
or
genius
in
some
men
this
dream
of
the
aroused
spirit
is
but
brief
mine
has
lasted
until
now
in
those
days
i
always
went
to
sleep
as
grand
duke
of
tuscany
as
a
millionaire
as
beloved
by
a
princess
or
famous
so
to
enter
the
service
of
comte
octave
and
have
a
hundred
louis
a
year
was
entering
on
independent
life
i
had
glimpses
of
some
chance
of
getting
into
society
and
seeking
for
what
my
heart
desired
most
a
protectress
who
would
rescue
me
from
the
paths
of
danger
which
a
young
man
of
can
hardly
help
treading
however
prudent
and
well
brought
up
he
may
be
i
began
to
be
afraid
of
myself
the
persistent
study
of
other
people
s
rights
into
which
i
had
plunged
was
not
always
enough
to
repress
painful
imaginings
yes
sometimes
in
fancy
i
threw
myself
into
theatrical
life
i
thought
i
could
be
a
great
actor
i
dreamed
of
endless
triumphs
and
loves
knowing
nothing
of
the
disillusion
hidden
behind
the
curtain
as
everywhere
else
for
every
stage
has
its
reverse
behind
the
scenes
i
have
gone
out
sometimes
my
heart
boiling
carried
away
by
an
impulse
to
rush
hunting
through
paris
to
attach
myself
to
some
handsome
woman
i
might
meet
to
follow
her
to
her
door
watch
her
write
to
her
throw
myself
on
her
mercy
and
conquer
her
by
sheer
force
of
passion
my
poor
uncle
a
heart
consumed
by
charity
a
child
of
seventy
years
as
as
god
as
guileless
as
a
man
of
genius
no
doubt
read
the
tumult
of
my
soul
for
when
he
felt
the
tether
by
which
he
held
me
strained
too
tightly
and
ready
to
break
he
would
never
fail
to
say
here
maurice
you
too
are
poor
here
are
twenty
francs
go
and
amuse
yourself
you
are
not
a
priest
and
if
you
could
have
seen
the
dancing
light
that
gilded
his
gray
eyes
the
smile
that
relaxed
his
fine
lips
puckering
the
corners
of
his
mouth
the
adorable
expression
of
that
august
face
whose
native
ugliness
was
redeemed
by
the
spirit
of
an
apostle
you
would
understand
the
feeling
which
made
me
answer
the
cure
of
white
friars
only
with
a
kiss
as
if
he
had
been
my
mother
in
comte
octave
you
will
find
not
a
master
but
a
friend
said
my
uncle
on
the
way
to
the
rue
payenne
but
he
is
distrustful
or
to
be
more
exact
he
is
cautious
the
statesman
s
friendship
can
be
won
only
with
time
for
in
spite
of
his
deep
insight
and
his
habit
of
gauging
men
he
was
deceived
by
the
man
you
are
succeeding
and
nearly
became
a
victim
to
his
abuse
of
confidence
this
is
enough
to
guide
you
in
your
behavior
to
when
we
knocked
at
the
enormous
outer
door
of
a
house
as
large
as
the
hotel
carnavalet
with
a
courtyard
in
front
and
a
garden
behind
the
sound
rang
as
in
a
desert
while
my
uncle
inquired
of
an
old
porter
in
livery
if
the
count
were
at
home
i
cast
my
eyes
seeing
everything
at
once
over
the
courtyard
where
the
cobblestones
were
hidden
in
the
grass
the
blackened
walls
where
little
gardens
were
flourishing
above
the
decorations
of
the
elegant
architecture
and
on
the
roof
as
high
as
that
of
the
tuileries
the
balustrade
of
the
upper
balconies
was
eaten
away
through
a
magnificent
colonnade
i
could
see
a
second
court
on
one
side
where
were
the
offices
the
door
was
rotting
an
old
coachman
was
there
cleaning
an
old
carriage
the
indifferent
air
of
this
servant
allowed
me
to
assume
that
the
handsome
stables
where
of
old
so
many
horses
had
whinnied
now
sheltered
two
at
most
the
handsome
facade
of
the
house
seemed
to
me
gloomy
like
that
of
a
mansion
belonging
to
the
state
or
the
crown
and
given
up
to
some
public
office
a
bell
rang
as
we
walked
across
my
uncle
and
i
from
the
porter
s
lodge
of
the
was
still
written
over
the
door
towards
the
outside
steps
where
a
footman
came
out
in
a
livery
like
that
of
labranche
at
the
theatre
francais
in
the
old
stock
plays
a
visitor
was
so
rare
that
the
servant
was
putting
his
coat
on
when
he
opened
a
glass
door
with
small
panes
on
each
side
of
which
the
smoke
of
a
lamp
had
traced
patterns
on
the
walls
a
hall
so
magnificent
as
to
be
worthy
of
versailles
ended
in
a
staircase
such
as
will
never
again
be
built
in
france
taking
up
as
much
space
as
the
whole
of
a
modern
house
as
we
went
up
the
marble
steps
as
cold
as
tombstones
and
wide
enough
for
eight
persons
to
walk
abreast
our
tread
echoed
under
sonorous
vaulting
the
banister
charmed
the
eye
by
its
miraculous
workmanship
goldsmith
s
work
in
iron
wrought
by
the
fancy
of
an
artist
of
the
time
of
henri
iii
chilled
as
by
an
icy
mantle
that
fell
on
our
shoulders
we
went
through
opening
one
out
of
the
other
with
carpetless
parquet
floors
and
furnished
with
such
splendid
antiquities
as
from
thence
would
find
their
way
to
the
curiosity
dealers
at
last
we
reached
a
large
study
in
a
cross
wing
with
all
the
windows
looking
into
an
immense
garden
monsieur
le
cure
of
the
white
friars
and
his
nephew
monsieur
de
l
hostal
said
labranche
to
whose
care
the
other
theatrical
servant
had
consigned
us
in
the
first
comte
octave
dressed
in
long
trousers
and
a
gray
flannel
morning
coat
rose
from
his
seat
by
a
huge
came
to
the
fireplace
and
signed
to
me
to
sit
down
while
he
went
forward
to
take
my
uncle
s
hands
which
he
pressed
though
i
am
in
the
parish
of
said
he
i
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
hear
of
the
cure
of
the
white
friars
and
i
am
happy
to
make
his
your
excellency
is
most
kind
replied
my
uncle
i
have
brought
to
you
my
only
remaining
relation
while
i
believe
that
i
am
offering
a
good
gift
to
your
excellency
i
hope
at
the
same
time
to
give
my
nephew
a
second
as
to
that
i
can
only
reply
monsieur
l
abbe
when
we
shall
have
tried
each
other
said
comte
octave
your
name
he
added
to
me
he
has
taken
his
doctor
s
degree
in
law
my
uncle
observed
very
good
very
good
said
the
count
looking
at
me
from
head
to
foot
monsieur
l
abbe
i
hope
that
for
your
nephew
s
sake
in
the
first
instance
and
then
for
mine
you
will
do
me
the
honor
of
dining
here
every
monday
that
will
be
our
family
dinner
our
family
my
uncle
and
the
count
then
began
to
talk
of
religion
from
the
political
point
of
view
of
charitable
institutes
the
repression
of
crime
and
i
could
at
my
leisure
study
the
man
on
whom
my
fate
would
henceforth
depend
the
count
was
of
middle
height
it
was
impossible
to
judge
of
his
build
on
account
of
his
dress
but
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
lean
and
spare
his
face
was
harsh
and
hollow
the
features
were
refined
his
mouth
which
was
rather
large
expressed
both
irony
and
kindliness
his
forehead
perhaps
too
spacious
was
as
intimidating
as
that
of
a
madman
all
the
more
so
from
the
contrast
of
the
lower
part
of
the
face
which
ended
squarely
in
a
short
chin
very
near
the
lower
lip
small
eyes
of
turquoise
blue
were
as
keen
and
bright
as
those
of
the
prince
de
talleyrand
which
i
admired
at
a
later
time
and
endowed
like
the
prince
s
with
the
faculty
of
becoming
expressionless
to
the
verge
of
gloom
and
they
added
to
the
singularity
of
a
face
that
was
not
pale
but
yellow
this
complexion
seemed
to
bespeak
an
irritable
temper
and
violent
passions
his
hair
already
silvered
and
carefully
dressed
seemed
to
furrow
his
head
with
streaks
of
black
and
white
alternately
the
trimness
of
this
head
spoiled
the
resemblance
i
had
remarked
in
the
count
to
the
wonderful
monk
described
by
lewis
after
schedoni
in
the
of
the
black
penitents
the
italian
a
superior
creation
as
it
seems
to
me
to
the
count
was
already
shaved
having
to
attend
early
at
the
law
courts
two
candelabra
with
four
lights
screened
by
were
still
burning
at
the
opposite
ends
of
the
and
showed
plainly
that
the
magistrate
rose
long
before
daylight
his
hands
which
i
saw
when
he
took
hold
of
the
to
summon
his
servant
were
extremely
fine
and
as
white
as
a
woman
s
as
i
tell
you
this
story
said
the
interrupting
himself
i
am
altering
the
titles
and
the
social
position
of
this
gentleman
while
placing
him
in
circumstances
analogous
to
what
his
really
were
his
profession
rank
luxury
fortune
and
style
of
living
were
the
same
all
these
details
are
true
but
i
would
not
be
false
to
my
benefactor
nor
to
my
usual
habits
of
discretion
instead
of
feeling
as
i
really
was
socially
speaking
an
insect
in
the
presence
of
an
eagle
the
narrator
went
on
after
a
pause
i
felt
i
know
not
what
indefinable
impression
from
the
count
s
appearance
which
however
i
can
now
account
for
artists
of
genius
and
he
bowed
gracefully
to
the
ambassador
the
distinguished
lady
and
the
two
frenchmen
real
statesmen
poets
a
general
who
has
commanded
armies
in
short
all
really
great
minds
are
simple
and
their
simplicity
places
you
on
a
level
with
you
who
are
all
of
superior
minds
he
said
addressing
his
guests
have
perhaps
observed
how
feeling
can
bridge
over
the
distances
created
by
society
if
we
are
inferior
to
you
in
intellect
we
can
be
your
equals
in
devoted
friendship
by
the
temperature
allow
me
the
word
of
our
hearts
i
felt
myself
as
near
my
patron
as
i
was
far
below
him
in
rank
in
short
the
soul
has
its
clairvoyance
it
has
presentiments
of
suffering
grief
joy
antagonism
or
hatred
in
others
i
vaguely
discerned
the
symptoms
of
a
mystery
from
recognizing
in
the
count
the
same
effects
of
physiognomy
as
i
had
observed
in
my
uncle
the
exercise
of
virtue
serenity
of
conscience
and
purity
of
mind
had
transfigured
my
uncle
who
from
being
ugly
had
become
quite
beautiful
i
detected
a
metamorphosis
of
a
reverse
kind
in
the
count
s
face
at
the
first
glance
i
thought
he
was
about
but
after
an
attentive
examination
i
found
youth
entombed
under
the
ice
of
a
great
sorrow
under
the
fatigue
of
persistent
study
under
the
glowing
hues
of
some
suppressed
passion
at
a
word
from
my
uncle
the
count
s
eyes
recovered
for
a
moment
the
softness
of
the
periwinkle
flower
and
he
had
an
admiring
smile
which
revealed
what
i
believed
to
be
his
real
age
about
forty
these
observations
i
made
not
then
but
afterwards
as
i
recalled
the
circumstances
of
my
visit
the
came
in
carrying
a
tray
with
his
master
s
breakfast
on
it
i
did
not
ask
for
breakfast
remarked
the
count
but
leave
it
and
show
monsieur
to
his
i
followed
the
servant
who
led
the
way
to
a
complete
set
of
pretty
rooms
under
a
terrace
between
the
great
courtyard
and
the
servants
quarters
over
a
corridor
of
communication
between
the
kitchens
and
the
grand
staircase
when
i
returned
to
the
count
s
study
i
overheard
before
opening
the
door
my
uncle
pronouncing
this
judgment
on
me
he
may
do
wrong
for
he
has
strong
feelings
and
we
are
all
liable
to
honorable
mistakes
but
he
has
no
well
said
the
count
with
a
kindly
look
do
you
like
yourself
there
tell
me
there
are
so
many
rooms
in
this
barrack
that
if
you
were
not
comfortable
i
could
put
you
at
my
uncle
s
i
had
but
one
room
replied
i
well
you
can
settle
yourself
this
evening
said
the
count
for
your
possessions
no
doubt
are
such
as
all
students
own
and
a
hackney
coach
will
be
enough
to
convey
them
we
will
all
three
dine
together
and
he
looked
at
my
uncle
a
splendid
library
opened
from
the
count
s
study
and
he
took
us
in
there
showing
me
a
pretty
little
recess
decorated
with
paintings
which
had
formerly
served
no
doubt
as
an
oratory
this
is
your
cell
said
he
you
will
sit
there
when
you
have
to
work
with
me
for
you
will
not
be
tethered
by
a
chain
and
he
explained
in
detail
the
kind
and
duration
of
my
employment
with
him
as
i
listened
i
felt
that
he
was
a
great
political
teacher
it
took
me
about
a
month
to
familiarize
myself
with
people
and
things
to
learn
the
duties
of
my
new
office
and
accustom
myself
to
the
count
s
methods
a
secretary
necessarily
watches
the
man
who
makes
use
of
him
that
man
s
tastes
passions
temper
and
manias
become
the
subject
of
involuntary
study
the
union
of
their
two
minds
is
at
once
more
and
less
than
a
marriage
during
these
months
the
count
and
i
reciprocally
studied
each
other
i
learned
with
astonishment
that
comte
octave
was
but
years
old
the
merely
superficial
peacefulness
of
his
life
and
the
propriety
of
his
conduct
were
the
outcome
not
solely
of
a
deep
sense
of
duty
and
of
stoical
reflection
in
my
constant
intercourse
with
this
man
an
extraordinary
man
to
those
who
knew
him
well
i
felt
vast
depths
beneath
his
toil
beneath
his
acts
of
politeness
his
mask
of
benignity
his
assumption
of
resignation
which
so
closely
resembled
calmness
that
it
is
easy
to
mistake
it
just
as
when
walking
through
certain
soils
give
forth
under
our
feet
a
sound
which
enables
us
to
guess
whether
they
are
dense
masses
of
stone
or
a
void
so
intense
egoism
though
hidden
under
the
flowers
of
politeness
and
subterranean
caverns
eaten
out
by
sorrow
sound
hollow
under
the
constant
touch
of
familiar
life
it
was
sorrow
and
not
despondency
that
dwelt
in
that
really
great
soul
the
count
had
understood
that
actions
deeds
are
the
supreme
law
of
social
man
and
he
went
on
his
way
in
spite
of
secret
wounds
looking
to
the
future
with
a
tranquil
eye
like
a
martyr
full
of
faith
his
concealed
sadness
the
bitter
disenchantment
from
which
he
suffered
had
not
led
him
into
philosophical
deserts
of
incredulity
this
brave
statesman
was
religious
without
ostentation
he
always
attended
the
earliest
mass
at
s
for
pious
workmen
and
servants
not
one
of
his
friends
no
one
at
court
knew
that
he
so
punctually
fulfilled
the
practice
of
religion
he
was
addicted
to
god
as
some
men
are
addicted
to
a
vice
with
the
greatest
mystery
thus
one
day
i
came
to
find
the
count
at
the
summit
of
an
alp
of
woe
much
higher
than
that
on
which
many
are
who
think
themselves
the
most
tried
who
laugh
at
the
passions
and
the
beliefs
of
others
because
they
have
conquered
their
own
who
play
variations
in
every
key
of
irony
and
disdain
he
did
not
mock
at
those
who
still
follow
hope
into
the
swamps
whither
she
leads
nor
those
who
climb
a
peak
to
be
alone
nor
those
who
persist
in
the
fight
reddening
the
arena
with
their
blood
and
strewing
it
with
their
illusions
he
looked
on
the
world
as
a
whole
he
mastered
its
beliefs
he
listened
to
its
complaining
he
was
doubtful
of
affection
and
yet
more
of
but
this
great
and
stern
judge
pitied
them
or
admired
them
not
with
transient
enthusiasm
but
with
silence
concentration
and
the
communion
of
a
soul
he
was
a
sort
of
catholic
manfred
and
unstained
by
crime
carrying
his
choiceness
into
his
faith
melting
the
snows
by
the
fires
of
a
sealed
volcano
holding
converse
with
a
star
seen
by
himself
alone
i
detected
many
dark
riddles
in
his
ordinary
life
he
evaded
my
gaze
not
like
a
traveler
who
following
a
path
disappears
from
time
to
time
in
dells
or
ravines
according
to
the
formation
of
the
soil
but
like
a
sharpshooter
who
is
being
watched
who
wants
to
hide
himself
and
seeks
a
cover
i
could
not
account
for
his
frequent
absences
at
the
times
when
he
was
working
the
hardest
and
of
which
he
made
no
secret
from
me
for
he
would
say
go
on
with
this
for
me
and
trust
me
with
the
work
in
hand
this
man
wrapped
in
the
threefold
duties
of
the
statesman
the
judge
and
the
orator
charmed
me
by
a
taste
for
flowers
which
shows
an
elegant
mind
and
which
is
shared
by
almost
all
persons
of
refinement
his
garden
and
his
study
were
full
of
the
rarest
plants
but
he
always
bought
them
perhaps
it
pleased
him
to
see
such
an
image
of
his
own
fate
he
was
faded
like
these
dying
flowers
whose
almost
decaying
fragrance
mounted
strangely
to
his
brain
the
count
loved
his
country
he
devoted
himself
to
public
interests
with
the
frenzy
of
a
heart
that
seeks
to
cheat
some
other
passion
but
the
studies
and
work
into
which
he
threw
himself
were
not
enough
for
him
there
were
frightful
struggles
in
his
mind
of
which
some
echoes
reached
me
finally
he
would
give
utterance
to
harrowing
aspirations
for
happiness
and
it
seemed
to
me
he
ought
yet
to
be
happy
but
what
was
the
obstacle
was
there
a
woman
he
loved
this
was
a
question
i
asked
myself
you
may
imagine
the
extent
of
the
circles
of
torment
that
my
mind
had
searched
before
coming
to
so
simple
and
so
terrible
a
question
notwithstanding
his
efforts
my
patron
did
not
succeed
in
stifling
the
movements
of
his
heart
under
his
austere
manner
under
the
reserve
of
the
magistrate
a
passion
rebelled
though
coerced
with
such
force
that
no
one
but
i
who
lived
with
him
ever
guessed
the
secret
his
motto
seemed
to
be
i
suffer
and
am
the
escort
of
respect
and
admiration
which
attended
him
the
friendship
of
workers
as
valiant
as
himself
grandville
and
serizy
both
presiding
judges
had
no
hold
over
the
count
either
he
told
them
nothing
or
they
knew
all
impassible
and
lofty
in
public
the
count
betrayed
the
man
only
on
rare
intervals
when
alone
in
his
garden
or
his
study
he
supposed
himself
unobserved
but
then
he
was
a
child
again
he
gave
course
to
the
tears
hidden
beneath
the
toga
to
the
excitement
which
if
wrongly
interpreted
might
have
damaged
his
credit
for
perspicacity
as
a
statesman
when
all
this
had
become
to
me
a
matter
of
certainty
comte
octave
had
all
the
attractions
of
a
problem
and
won
on
my
affection
as
much
as
though
he
had
been
my
own
father
can
you
enter
into
the
feeling
of
curiosity
tempered
by
respect
what
catastrophe
had
blasted
this
learned
man
who
like
pitt
had
devoted
himself
from
the
age
of
eighteen
to
the
studies
indispensable
to
power
while
he
had
no
ambition
this
judge
who
thoroughly
knew
the
law
of
nations
political
law
civil
and
criminal
law
and
who
could
find
in
these
a
weapon
against
every
anxiety
against
every
mistake
this
profound
legislator
this
serious
writer
this
pious
celibate
whose
life
sufficiently
proved
that
he
was
open
to
no
reproach
a
criminal
could
not
have
been
more
hardly
punished
by
god
than
was
my
master
sorrow
had
robbed
him
of
half
his
slumbers
he
never
slept
more
than
four
hours
what
struggle
was
it
that
went
on
in
the
depths
of
these
hours
apparently
so
calm
so
studious
passing
without
a
sound
or
a
murmur
during
which
i
often
detected
him
when
the
pen
had
dropped
from
his
fingers
with
his
head
resting
on
one
hand
his
eyes
like
two
fixed
stars
and
sometimes
wet
with
tears
how
could
the
waters
of
that
living
spring
flow
over
the
burning
strand
without
being
dried
up
by
the
subterranean
fire
was
there
below
it
as
there
is
under
the
sea
between
it
and
the
central
fires
of
the
globe
a
bed
of
granite
and
would
the
volcano
burst
at
last
sometimes
the
count
would
give
me
a
look
of
that
sagacious
and
curiosity
by
which
one
man
searches
another
when
he
desires
an
accomplice
then
he
shunned
my
eye
as
he
saw
it
open
a
mouth
so
to
speak
insisting
on
a
reply
and
seeming
to
say
speak
first
now
and
then
comte
octave
s
melancholy
was
surly
and
gruff
if
these
spurts
of
temper
offended
me
he
could
get
over
it
without
thinking
of
asking
my
pardon
but
then
his
manners
were
gracious
to
the
point
of
christian
humility
when
i
became
attached
like
a
son
to
this
man
to
me
such
a
mystery
but
so
intelligible
to
the
outer
world
to
whom
the
epithet
eccentric
is
enough
to
account
for
all
the
enigmas
of
the
heart
i
changed
the
state
of
the
house
neglect
of
his
own
interests
was
carried
by
the
count
to
the
length
of
folly
in
the
management
of
his
affairs
possessing
an
income
of
about
a
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
francs
without
including
the
emoluments
of
his
appointments
three
of
which
did
not
come
under
the
law
against
plurality
he
spent
sixty
thousand
of
which
at
least
thirty
thousand
went
to
his
servants
by
the
end
of
the
first
year
i
had
got
rid
of
all
these
rascals
and
begged
his
excellency
to
use
his
influence
in
helping
me
to
get
honest
servants
by
the
end
of
the
second
year
the
count
better
fed
and
better
served
enjoyed
the
comforts
of
modern
life
he
had
fine
horses
supplied
by
a
coachman
to
whom
i
paid
so
much
a
month
for
each
horse
his
dinners
on
his
reception
days
furnished
by
chevet
at
a
price
agreed
upon
did
him
credit
his
daily
meals
were
prepared
by
an
excellent
cook
found
by
my
uncle
and
helped
by
two
kitchenmaids
the
expenditure
for
housekeeping
not
including
purchases
was
no
more
than
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
we
had
two
additional
whose
care
restored
the
poetical
aspect
of
the
house
for
this
old
palace
splendid
even
in
its
rust
had
an
air
of
dignity
which
neglect
had
dishonored
i
am
no
longer
astonished
said
he
on
hearing
of
these
results
at
the
fortunes
made
by
servants
in
seven
years
i
have
had
two
cooks
who
have
become
rich
early
in
the
year
the
count
had
no
doubt
ceased
to
watch
me
and
we
were
as
closely
attached
as
two
men
can
be
when
one
is
subordinate
to
the
other
he
had
never
spoken
to
me
of
my
future
prospects
but
he
had
taken
an
interest
both
as
a
master
and
as
a
father
in
training
me
he
often
required
me
to
collect
materials
for
his
most
arduous
labors
i
drew
up
some
of
his
reports
and
he
corrected
them
showing
the
difference
between
his
interpretation
of
the
law
his
views
and
mine
when
at
last
i
had
produced
a
document
which
he
could
give
in
as
his
own
he
was
delighted
this
satisfaction
was
my
reward
and
he
could
see
that
i
took
it
so
this
little
incident
produced
an
extraordinary
effect
on
a
soul
which
seemed
so
stern
the
count
pronounced
sentence
on
me
to
use
a
legal
phrase
as
supreme
and
royal
judge
he
took
my
head
in
his
hands
and
kissed
me
on
the
forehead
maurice
he
exclaimed
you
are
no
longer
my
apprentice
i
know
not
yet
what
you
will
be
to
me
but
if
no
change
occurs
in
my
life
perhaps
you
will
take
the
place
of
a
comte
octave
had
introduced
me
to
the
best
houses
in
paris
whither
i
went
in
his
stead
with
his
servants
and
carriage
on
the
too
frequent
occasions
when
on
the
point
of
starting
he
changed
his
mind
and
sent
for
a
hackney
cab
to
take
him
where
that
was
the
mystery
by
the
welcome
i
met
with
i
could
judge
of
the
count
s
feelings
towards
me
and
the
earnestness
of
his
recommendations
he
supplied
all
my
wants
with
the
thoughtfulness
of
a
father
and
with
all
the
greater
liberality
because
my
modesty
left
it
to
him
always
to
think
of
me
towards
the
end
of
january
at
the
house
of
the
comtesse
de
serizy
i
had
such
persistent
at
play
that
i
lost
two
thousand
francs
and
i
would
not
draw
them
out
of
my
savings
next
morning
i
asked
myself
had
i
better
ask
my
uncle
for
the
money
or
put
my
confidence
in
the
count
i
decided
on
the
second
alternative
yesterday
said
i
when
he
was
at
breakfast
i
lost
persistently
at
play
i
was
provoked
and
went
on
i
owe
two
thousand
francs
will
you
allow
me
to
draw
the
sum
on
account
of
my
year
s
salary
no
said
he
with
the
sweetest
smile
when
a
man
plays
in
society
he
must
have
a
gambling
purse
draw
six
thousand
francs
pay
your
debts
henceforth
we
must
go
halves
for
since
you
are
my
representative
on
most
occasions
your
must
not
be
made
to
suffer
for
i
made
no
speech
of
thanks
thanks
would
have
been
superfluous
between
us
this
shade
shows
the
character
of
our
relations
and
yet
we
had
not
yet
unlimited
confidence
in
each
other
he
did
not
open
to
me
the
vast
subterranean
chambers
which
i
had
detected
in
his
secret
life
and
i
for
my
part
never
said
to
him
what
ails
you
from
what
are
you
suffering
what
could
he
be
doing
during
those
long
evenings
he
would
often
come
in
on
foot
or
in
a
hackney
cab
when
i
returned
in
a
carriage
i
his
secretary
was
so
pious
a
man
a
prey
to
vices
hidden
under
hypocrisy
did
he
expend
all
the
powers
of
his
mind
to
satisfy
a
jealousy
more
dexterous
than
othello
s
did
he
live
with
some
woman
unworthy
of
him
one
morning
on
returning
from
i
have
forgotten
what
shop
where
i
had
just
paid
a
bill
between
the
church
of
and
the
hotel
de
ville
i
came
across
comte
octave
in
such
eager
conversation
with
an
old
woman
that
he
did
not
see
me
the
appearance
of
this
hag
filled
me
with
strange
suspicions
suspicions
that
were
all
the
better
founded
because
i
never
found
that
the
count
invested
his
savings
is
it
not
shocking
to
think
of
i
was
constituting
myself
my
patron
s
censor
at
that
time
i
knew
that
he
had
more
than
six
hundred
thousand
francs
to
invest
and
if
he
had
bought
securities
of
any
kind
his
confidence
in
me
was
so
complete
in
all
that
concerned
his
pecuniary
interests
that
i
certainly
should
have
known
it
sometimes
in
the
morning
the
count
took
exercise
in
his
garden
to
and
fro
like
a
man
to
whom
a
walk
is
the
hippogryph
ridden
by
dreamy
melancholy
he
walked
and
walked
and
he
rubbed
his
hands
enough
to
rub
the
skin
off
and
then
if
i
met
him
unexpectedly
as
he
came
to
the
angle
of
a
path
i
saw
his
face
beaming
his
eyes
instead
of
the
hardness
of
a
turquoise
had
that
velvety
softness
of
the
blue
periwinkle
which
had
so
much
struck
me
on
the
occasion
of
my
first
visit
by
reason
of
the
astonishing
contrast
in
the
two
different
looks
the
look
of
a
happy
man
and
the
look
of
an
unhappy
man
two
or
three
times
at
such
a
moment
he
had
taken
me
by
the
arm
and
led
me
on
then
he
had
said
what
have
you
come
to
ask
instead
of
pouring
out
his
joy
into
my
heart
that
opened
to
him
but
more
often
especially
since
i
could
do
his
work
for
him
and
write
his
reports
the
unhappy
man
would
sit
for
hours
staring
at
the
goldfish
that
swarmed
in
a
handsome
marble
basin
in
the
middle
of
the
garden
round
which
grew
an
amphitheatre
of
the
finest
flowers
he
an
accomplished
statesman
seemed
to
have
succeeded
in
making
a
passion
of
the
mechanical
amusement
of
crumbling
bread
to
fishes
this
is
how
the
drama
was
disclosed
of
this
second
inner
life
so
deeply
ravaged
and
where
in
a
circle
overlooked
by
dante
in
his
horrible
joys
had
their
the
paused
on
a
certain
monday
he
resumed
as
chance
would
have
it
le
president
de
grandville
and
de
serizy
at
that
time
of
the
council
of
state
had
come
to
hold
a
meeting
at
comte
octave
s
house
they
formed
a
committee
of
three
of
which
i
was
the
secretary
the
count
had
already
got
me
the
appointment
of
auditor
to
the
council
of
state
all
the
documents
requisite
for
their
inquiry
into
the
political
matter
privately
submitted
to
these
three
gentlemen
were
laid
out
on
one
of
the
long
tables
in
the
library
mm
de
grandville
and
de
serizy
had
trusted
to
the
count
to
make
the
preliminary
examination
of
the
papers
relating
to
the
matter
to
avoid
the
necessity
for
carrying
all
the
papers
to
de
serizy
as
president
of
the
commission
it
was
decided
that
they
should
meet
first
in
the
rue
payenne
the
cabinet
at
the
tuileries
attached
great
importance
to
this
piece
of
work
of
which
the
chief
burden
fell
on
me
and
to
which
i
owed
my
appointment
in
the
course
of
that
year
to
be
master
of
appeals
though
the
comtes
de
grandville
and
de
serizy
whose
habits
were
much
the
same
as
my
patron
s
never
dined
away
from
home
we
were
still
discussing
the
matter
at
a
late
hour
when
we
were
startled
by
the
calling
me
aside
to
say
mm
the
cures
of
and
of
the
white
friars
have
been
waiting
in
the
for
two
it
was
nine
o
clock
well
gentlemen
you
find
yourselves
compelled
to
dine
with
priests
said
comte
octave
to
his
colleagues
i
do
not
know
whether
grandville
can
overcome
his
horror
of
a
priest
s
gown
it
depends
on
the
one
of
them
is
my
uncle
and
the
other
is
the
abbe
gaudron
said
i
do
not
be
alarmed
the
abbe
fontanon
is
no
longer
second
priest
at
well
let
us
dine
replied
the
president
de
grandville
a
bigot
frightens
me
but
there
is
no
one
so
cheerful
as
a
truly
pious
we
went
into
the
the
dinner
was
delightful
men
of
real
information
politicians
to
whom
business
gives
both
consummate
experience
and
the
practice
of
speech
are
admirable
when
they
tell
stories
with
them
there
is
no
medium
they
are
either
heavy
or
they
are
sublime
in
this
delightful
sport
prince
metternich
is
as
good
as
charles
nodier
the
fun
of
a
statesman
cut
in
facets
like
a
diamond
is
sharp
sparkling
and
full
of
sense
being
sure
that
the
proprieties
would
be
observed
by
these
three
superior
men
my
uncle
allowed
his
wit
full
play
a
refined
wit
gentle
penetrating
and
elegant
like
that
of
all
men
who
are
accustomed
to
conceal
their
thoughts
under
the
black
robe
and
you
may
rely
upon
it
there
was
nothing
vulgar
nor
idle
in
this
light
talk
which
i
would
compare
for
its
effect
on
the
soul
to
rossini
s
music
the
abbe
gaudron
was
as
de
grandville
said
a
saint
peter
rather
than
a
saint
paul
a
peasant
full
of
faith
as
square
on
his
feet
as
he
was
tall
a
sacerdotal
of
whose
ignorance
in
matters
of
the
world
and
of
literature
enlivened
the
conversation
by
guileless
amazement
and
unexpected
questions
they
came
to
talking
of
one
of
the
plague
spots
of
social
life
of
which
we
were
just
now
speaking
adultery
my
uncle
remarked
on
the
contradiction
which
the
legislators
of
the
code
still
feeling
the
blows
of
the
revolutionary
storm
had
established
between
civil
and
religious
law
and
which
he
said
was
at
the
root
of
all
the
mischief
in
the
eyes
of
the
church
said
he
adultery
is
a
crime
in
those
of
your
tribunals
it
is
a
misdemeanor
adultery
drives
to
the
police
court
in
a
carriage
instead
of
standing
at
the
bar
to
be
tried
napoleon
s
council
of
state
touched
with
tenderness
towards
erring
women
was
quite
inefficient
ought
they
not
in
this
case
to
have
harmonized
the
civil
and
the
religious
law
and
have
sent
the
guilty
wife
to
a
convent
as
of
old
to
a
convent
said
de
serizy
they
must
first
have
created
convents
and
in
those
days
monasteries
were
being
turned
into
barracks
besides
think
of
what
you
say
l
abbe
give
to
god
what
society
would
have
none
of
oh
said
the
comte
de
grandville
you
do
not
know
france
they
were
obliged
to
leave
the
husband
free
to
take
proceedings
well
there
are
not
ten
cases
of
adultery
brought
up
in
a
m
l
abbe
preaches
for
his
own
saint
for
it
was
jesus
christ
who
invented
adultery
said
comte
octave
in
the
east
the
cradle
of
the
human
race
woman
was
merely
a
luxury
and
there
was
regarded
as
a
chattel
no
virtues
were
demanded
of
her
but
obedience
and
beauty
by
exalting
the
soul
above
the
body
the
modern
family
in
europe
a
daughter
of
christ
invented
indissoluble
marriage
and
made
it
a
ah
the
church
saw
the
difficulties
exclaimed
de
grandville
this
institution
has
given
rise
to
a
new
world
the
count
went
on
with
a
smile
but
the
practices
of
that
world
will
never
be
that
of
a
climate
where
women
are
marriageable
at
seven
years
of
age
and
more
than
old
at
the
catholic
church
overlooked
the
needs
of
half
the
so
let
us
discuss
europe
only
is
woman
our
superior
or
our
inferior
that
is
the
real
question
so
far
as
we
are
concerned
if
woman
is
our
inferior
by
placing
her
on
so
high
a
level
as
the
church
does
fearful
punishments
for
adultery
were
needful
and
formerly
that
was
what
was
done
the
cloister
or
death
sums
up
early
legislation
but
since
then
practice
has
modified
the
law
as
is
always
the
case
the
throne
served
as
a
hotbed
for
adultery
and
the
increase
of
this
inviting
crime
marks
the
decline
of
the
dogmas
of
the
catholic
church
in
these
days
in
cases
where
the
church
now
exacts
no
more
than
sincere
repentance
from
the
erring
wife
society
is
satisfied
with
a
instead
of
an
execution
the
law
still
condemns
the
guilty
but
it
no
longer
terrifies
them
in
short
there
are
two
standards
of
morals
that
of
the
world
and
that
of
the
code
where
the
code
is
weak
as
i
admit
with
our
dear
abbe
the
world
is
audacious
and
satirical
there
are
so
few
judges
who
would
not
gladly
have
committed
the
fault
against
which
they
hurl
the
rather
stolid
thunders
of
their
the
world
which
gives
the
lie
to
the
law
alike
in
its
rejoicings
in
its
habits
and
in
its
pleasures
is
severer
than
the
code
and
the
church
the
world
punishes
a
blunder
after
encouraging
hypocrisy
the
whole
economy
of
the
law
on
marriage
seems
to
me
to
require
reconstruction
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
the
french
law
would
be
perfect
perhaps
if
it
excluded
daughters
from
we
three
among
us
know
the
question
very
thoroughly
said
the
comte
de
grandville
with
a
laugh
i
have
a
wife
i
can
not
live
with
serizy
has
a
wife
who
will
not
live
with
him
as
for
you
octave
yours
ran
away
from
you
so
we
three
represent
every
case
of
the
conjugal
conscience
and
no
doubt
if
ever
divorce
is
brought
in
again
we
shall
form
the
octave
s
fork
dropped
on
his
glass
broke
it
and
broke
his
plate
he
had
turned
as
pale
as
death
and
flashed
a
thunderous
glare
at
de
grandville
by
which
he
hinted
at
my
presence
and
which
i
caught
forgive
me
my
dear
fellow
i
did
not
see
maurice
the
president
went
on
serizy
and
i
after
being
the
witnesses
to
your
marriage
became
your
accomplices
i
did
not
think
i
was
committing
an
indiscretion
in
the
presence
of
these
two
venerable
m
de
serizy
changed
the
subject
by
relating
all
he
had
done
to
please
his
wife
without
ever
succeeding
the
old
man
concluded
that
it
was
impossible
to
regulate
human
sympathies
and
antipathies
he
maintained
that
social
law
was
never
more
perfect
than
when
it
was
nearest
to
natural
law
now
nature
takes
no
account
of
the
affinities
of
souls
her
aim
is
fulfilled
by
the
propagation
of
the
species
hence
the
code
in
its
present
form
was
wise
in
leaving
a
wide
latitude
to
chance
the
incapacity
of
daughters
to
inherit
so
long
as
there
were
male
heirs
was
an
excellent
provision
whether
to
hinder
the
degeneration
of
the
race
or
to
make
households
happier
by
abolishing
scandalous
unions
and
giving
the
sole
preference
to
moral
qualities
and
beauty
but
then
he
exclaimed
lifting
his
hand
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
how
are
we
to
perfect
legislation
in
a
country
which
insists
on
bringing
together
seven
or
eight
hundred
legislators
after
all
if
i
am
sacrificed
he
added
i
have
a
child
to
succeed
setting
aside
all
the
religious
question
my
uncle
said
i
would
remark
to
your
excellency
that
nature
only
owes
us
life
and
that
it
is
society
that
owes
us
happiness
are
you
a
father
asked
my
uncle
and
i
have
i
any
children
said
comte
octave
in
a
hollow
voice
and
his
tone
made
such
an
impression
that
there
was
no
more
talk
of
wives
or
marriage
when
coffee
had
been
served
the
two
counts
and
the
two
priests
stole
away
seeing
that
poor
octave
had
fallen
into
a
fit
of
melancholy
which
prevented
his
noticing
their
disappearance
my
patron
was
sitting
in
an
armchair
by
the
fire
in
the
attitude
of
a
man
crushed
you
now
know
the
secret
of
my
life
said
he
to
me
on
noticing
that
we
were
alone
after
three
years
of
married
life
one
evening
when
i
came
in
i
found
a
letter
in
which
the
countess
announced
her
flight
the
letter
did
not
lack
dignity
for
it
is
in
the
nature
of
women
to
preserve
some
virtues
even
when
committing
that
horrible
the
story
is
now
that
my
wife
went
abroad
in
a
ship
that
was
wrecked
she
is
supposed
to
be
dead
i
have
lived
alone
for
seven
years
enough
for
this
evening
maurice
we
will
talk
of
my
situation
when
i
have
grown
used
to
the
idea
of
speaking
of
it
to
you
when
we
suffer
from
a
chronic
disease
it
needs
time
to
become
accustomed
to
improvement
that
improvement
often
seems
to
be
merely
another
aspect
of
the
i
went
to
bed
greatly
agitated
for
the
mystery
far
from
being
explained
seemed
to
me
more
obscure
than
ever
i
foresaw
some
strange
drama
indeed
for
i
understood
that
there
could
be
no
vulgar
difference
between
the
woman
that
count
could
choose
and
such
a
character
as
his
the
events
which
had
driven
the
countess
to
leave
a
man
so
noble
so
amiable
so
perfect
so
loving
so
worthy
to
be
loved
must
have
been
singular
to
say
the
least
de
grandville
s
remark
had
been
like
a
torch
flung
into
the
caverns
over
which
i
had
so
long
been
walking
and
though
the
flame
lighted
them
but
dimly
my
eyes
could
perceive
their
wide
extent
i
could
imagine
the
count
s
sufferings
without
knowing
their
depths
or
their
bitterness
that
sallow
face
those
parched
temples
those
overwhelming
studies
those
moments
of
absentmindedness
the
smallest
details
of
the
life
of
this
married
bachelor
all
stood
out
in
luminous
relief
during
the
hour
of
mental
questioning
which
is
as
it
were
the
twilight
before
sleep
and
to
which
any
man
would
have
given
himself
up
as
i
did
oh
how
i
loved
my
poor
master
he
seemed
to
me
sublime
i
read
a
poem
of
melancholy
i
saw
perpetual
activity
in
the
heart
i
had
accused
of
being
torpid
must
not
supreme
grief
always
come
at
last
to
stagnation
had
this
judge
who
had
so
much
in
his
power
ever
revenged
himself
was
he
feeding
himself
on
her
long
agony
is
it
not
a
remarkable
thing
in
paris
to
keep
anger
always
seething
for
ten
years
what
had
octave
done
since
this
great
misfortune
for
the
separation
of
husband
and
wife
is
a
great
misfortune
in
our
day
when
domestic
life
has
become
a
social
question
which
it
never
was
of
old
we
allowed
a
few
days
to
pass
on
the
watch
for
great
sorrows
have
a
diffidence
of
their
own
but
at
last
one
evening
the
count
said
in
a
grave
voice
this
as
nearly
as
may
be
is
his
story
my
father
had
a
ward
rich
and
lovely
who
was
sixteen
at
the
time
when
i
came
back
from
college
to
live
in
this
old
house
honorine
who
had
been
brought
up
by
my
mother
was
just
awakening
to
life
full
of
grace
and
of
childish
ways
she
dreamed
of
happiness
as
she
would
have
dreamed
of
jewels
perhaps
happiness
seemed
to
her
the
jewel
of
the
soul
her
piety
was
not
free
from
puerile
pleasures
for
everything
even
religion
was
poetry
to
her
ingenuous
heart
she
looked
to
the
future
as
a
perpetual
fete
innocent
and
pure
no
delirium
had
disturbed
her
dream
shame
and
grief
had
never
tinged
her
cheek
nor
moistened
her
eye
she
did
not
even
inquire
into
the
secret
of
her
involuntary
emotions
on
a
fine
spring
day
and
then
she
felt
that
she
was
weak
and
destined
to
obedience
and
she
awaited
marriage
without
wishing
for
it
her
smiling
imagination
knew
nothing
of
the
corruption
necessary
perhaps
which
literature
imparts
by
depicting
the
passions
she
knew
nothing
of
the
world
and
was
ignorant
of
all
the
dangers
of
society
the
dear
child
had
suffered
so
little
that
she
had
not
even
developed
her
courage
in
short
her
guilelessness
would
have
led
her
to
walk
fearless
among
serpents
like
the
ideal
figure
of
innocence
a
painter
once
created
we
lived
together
like
two
brothers
at
the
end
of
a
year
i
said
to
her
one
day
in
the
garden
of
this
house
by
the
basin
as
we
stood
throwing
crumbs
to
the
fish
would
you
like
that
we
should
be
married
with
me
you
could
do
whatever
you
please
while
another
man
would
make
you
mamma
said
she
to
my
mother
who
came
out
to
join
us
octave
and
i
have
agreed
to
be
married
what
at
seventeen
said
my
mother
no
you
must
wait
eighteen
months
and
if
eighteen
months
hence
you
like
each
other
well
your
birth
and
fortunes
are
equal
you
can
make
a
marriage
which
is
suitable
as
well
as
being
a
love
when
i
was
and
honorine
nineteen
we
were
married
our
respect
for
my
father
and
mother
old
folks
of
the
bourbon
court
hindered
us
from
making
this
house
fashionable
or
renewing
the
furniture
we
lived
on
as
we
had
done
in
the
past
as
children
however
i
went
into
society
i
initiated
my
wife
into
the
world
of
fashion
and
i
regarded
it
as
one
of
my
duties
to
instruct
her
i
recognized
afterwards
that
marriages
contracted
under
such
circumstances
as
ours
bear
in
themselves
a
rock
against
which
many
affections
are
wrecked
many
prudent
calculations
many
lives
the
husband
becomes
a
pedagogue
or
if
you
like
a
professor
and
love
perishes
under
the
rod
which
sooner
or
later
gives
pain
for
a
young
and
handsome
wife
at
once
discreet
and
will
not
accept
any
superiority
above
that
with
which
she
is
endowed
by
nature
perhaps
i
was
in
the
wrong
during
the
difficult
beginnings
of
a
household
i
perhaps
assumed
a
magisterial
tone
on
the
other
hand
i
may
have
made
the
mistake
of
trusting
too
entirely
to
that
artless
nature
i
kept
no
watch
over
the
countess
in
whom
revolt
seemed
to
me
impossible
alas
neither
in
politics
nor
in
domestic
life
has
it
yet
been
ascertained
whether
empires
and
happiness
are
wrecked
by
too
much
confidence
or
too
much
severity
perhaps
again
the
husband
failed
to
realize
honorine
s
girlish
dreams
who
can
tell
while
happy
days
last
what
precepts
he
has
neglected
i
remember
only
the
broad
outlines
of
the
reproaches
the
count
addressed
to
himself
with
all
the
good
faith
of
an
anatomist
seeking
the
cause
of
a
disease
which
might
be
overlooked
by
his
brethren
but
his
merciful
indulgence
struck
me
then
as
really
worthy
of
that
of
jesus
christ
when
he
rescued
the
woman
taken
in
adultery
it
was
eighteen
months
after
my
father
s
death
my
mother
followed
him
to
the
tomb
in
a
few
months
when
the
fearful
night
came
which
surprised
me
by
honorine
s
farewell
letter
what
poetic
delusion
had
seduced
my
wife
was
it
through
her
senses
was
it
the
magnetism
of
misfortune
or
of
genius
which
of
these
powers
had
taken
her
by
storm
or
misled
her
i
would
not
know
the
blow
was
so
terrible
that
for
a
month
i
remained
stunned
afterwards
reflection
counseled
me
to
continue
in
ignorance
and
honorine
s
misfortunes
have
since
taught
me
too
much
about
all
these
so
far
maurice
the
story
is
commonplace
enough
but
one
word
will
change
it
all
i
love
honorine
i
have
never
ceased
to
worship
her
from
the
day
when
she
left
me
i
have
lived
on
memory
one
by
one
i
recall
the
pleasures
for
which
honorine
no
doubt
had
no
taste
oh
said
he
seeing
the
amazement
in
my
eyes
do
not
make
a
hero
of
me
do
not
think
me
such
a
fool
as
the
colonel
of
the
empire
would
say
as
to
have
sought
no
diversion
alas
my
boy
i
was
either
too
young
or
too
much
in
love
i
have
not
in
the
whole
world
met
with
another
woman
after
frightful
struggles
with
myself
i
tried
to
forget
money
in
hand
i
stood
on
the
very
threshold
of
infidelity
but
there
the
memory
of
honorine
rose
before
me
like
a
white
statue
as
i
recalled
the
infinite
delicacy
of
that
exquisite
skin
through
which
the
blood
might
be
seen
coursing
and
the
nerves
quivering
as
i
saw
in
fancy
that
ingenuous
face
as
guileless
on
the
eve
of
my
sorrows
as
on
the
day
when
i
said
to
her
shall
we
marry
as
i
remembered
a
heavenly
fragrance
the
very
odor
of
virtue
and
the
light
in
her
eyes
the
prettiness
of
her
movements
i
fled
like
a
man
preparing
to
violate
a
tomb
who
sees
emerging
from
it
the
transfigured
soul
of
the
dead
at
consultations
in
court
by
night
i
dream
so
incessantly
of
honorine
that
only
by
excessive
strength
of
mind
do
i
succeed
in
attending
to
what
i
am
doing
and
saying
this
is
the
secret
of
my
labors
well
i
felt
no
more
anger
with
her
than
a
father
can
feel
on
seeing
his
beloved
child
in
some
danger
it
has
imprudently
rushed
into
i
understood
that
i
had
made
a
poem
of
my
wife
a
poem
i
delighted
in
with
such
intoxication
that
i
fancied
she
shared
the
intoxication
ah
maurice
an
indiscriminating
passion
in
a
husband
is
a
mistake
that
may
lead
to
any
crime
in
a
wife
i
had
no
doubt
left
all
the
faculties
of
this
child
loved
as
a
child
entirely
unemployed
i
had
perhaps
wearied
her
with
my
love
before
the
hour
of
loving
had
struck
for
her
too
young
to
understand
that
in
the
constancy
of
the
wife
lies
the
germ
of
the
mother
s
devotion
she
mistook
this
first
test
of
marriage
for
life
itself
and
the
refractory
child
cursed
life
unknown
to
me
nor
daring
to
complain
to
me
out
of
sheer
modesty
perhaps
in
so
cruel
a
position
she
would
be
defenceless
against
any
man
who
stirred
her
and
i
so
wise
a
judge
as
they
say
i
who
have
a
kind
heart
but
whose
mind
was
absorbed
i
understood
too
late
these
unwritten
laws
of
the
woman
s
code
i
read
them
by
the
light
of
the
fire
that
wrecked
my
roof
then
i
constituted
my
heart
a
tribunal
by
virtue
of
the
law
for
the
law
makes
the
husband
a
judge
i
acquitted
my
wife
and
i
condemned
myself
but
love
took
possession
of
me
as
a
passion
the
mean
despotic
passion
which
comes
over
some
old
men
at
this
day
i
love
the
absent
honorine
as
a
man
of
sixty
loves
a
woman
whom
he
must
possess
at
any
cost
and
yet
i
feel
the
strength
of
a
young
man
i
have
the
insolence
of
the
old
man
and
the
reserve
of
a
my
dear
fellow
society
only
laughs
at
such
a
desperate
conjugal
predicament
where
it
pities
a
lover
it
regards
a
husband
as
ridiculously
inept
it
makes
sport
of
those
who
can
not
keep
the
woman
they
have
secured
under
the
canopy
of
the
church
and
before
the
maire
s
scarf
of
office
and
i
had
to
keep
silence
serizy
is
happy
his
indulgence
allows
him
to
see
his
wife
he
can
protect
and
defend
her
and
as
he
adores
her
he
knows
all
the
perfect
joys
of
a
benefactor
whom
nothing
can
disturb
not
even
ridicule
for
he
pours
it
himself
on
his
fatherly
pleasures
i
remain
married
only
for
my
wife
s
sake
he
said
to
me
one
day
on
coming
out
of
court
but
i
i
have
nothing
i
have
not
even
to
face
ridicule
i
who
live
solely
on
a
love
which
is
starving
i
who
can
never
find
a
word
to
say
to
a
woman
of
the
world
i
who
loathe
prostitution
i
who
am
faithful
under
a
spell
but
for
my
religious
faith
i
should
have
killed
myself
i
have
defied
the
gulf
of
hard
work
i
have
thrown
myself
into
it
and
come
out
again
alive
fevered
burning
bereft
of
sleep
i
can
not
remember
all
the
words
of
this
eloquent
man
to
whom
passion
gave
an
eloquence
indeed
so
far
above
that
of
the
pleader
that
as
i
listened
to
him
i
like
him
felt
my
cheeks
wet
with
tears
you
may
conceive
of
my
feelings
when
after
a
pause
during
which
we
dried
them
away
he
finished
his
story
with
this
revelation
this
is
the
drama
of
my
soul
but
it
is
not
the
actual
living
drama
which
is
at
this
moment
being
acted
in
paris
the
interior
drama
interests
nobody
i
know
it
and
you
will
one
day
admit
that
it
is
so
you
who
at
this
moment
shed
tears
with
me
no
one
can
burden
his
heart
or
his
skin
with
another
s
pain
the
measure
of
our
sufferings
is
in
you
even
understand
my
sorrows
only
by
very
vague
analogy
could
you
see
me
calming
the
most
violent
frenzy
of
despair
by
the
contemplation
of
a
miniature
in
which
i
can
see
and
kiss
her
brow
the
smile
on
her
lips
the
shape
of
her
face
can
breathe
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
which
enables
me
almost
to
feel
to
play
with
the
black
masses
of
her
curling
hair
could
you
see
me
when
i
leap
with
hope
when
i
writhe
under
the
myriad
darts
of
despair
when
i
tramp
through
the
mire
of
paris
to
quell
my
irritation
by
fatigue
i
have
fits
of
collapse
comparable
to
those
of
a
consumptive
patient
moods
of
wild
hilarity
terrors
as
of
a
murderer
who
meets
a
sergeant
of
police
in
short
my
life
is
a
continual
paroxysm
of
fears
joy
and
dejection
as
to
the
drama
it
is
this
you
imagine
that
i
am
occupied
with
the
council
of
state
the
chamber
the
courts
why
dear
me
seven
hours
at
night
are
enough
for
all
that
so
much
are
my
faculties
overwrought
by
the
life
i
lead
honorine
is
my
real
concern
to
recover
my
wife
is
my
only
study
to
guard
her
in
her
cage
without
her
suspecting
that
she
is
in
my
power
to
satisfy
her
needs
to
supply
the
little
pleasure
she
allows
herself
to
be
always
about
her
like
a
sylph
without
allowing
her
to
see
or
to
suspect
me
for
if
she
did
the
future
would
be
lost
that
is
my
life
my
true
for
seven
years
i
have
never
gone
to
bed
without
going
first
to
see
the
light
of
her
or
her
shadow
on
the
window
curtains
she
left
my
house
choosing
to
take
nothing
but
the
dress
she
wore
that
day
the
child
carried
her
magnanimity
to
the
point
of
folly
consequently
eighteen
months
after
her
flight
she
was
deserted
by
her
lover
who
was
appalled
by
the
cold
cruel
sinister
and
revolting
aspect
of
poverty
the
coward
the
man
had
no
doubt
counted
on
the
easy
and
luxurious
life
in
switzerland
or
italy
which
fine
ladies
indulge
in
when
they
leave
their
husbands
honorine
has
sixty
thousand
francs
a
year
of
her
own
the
wretch
left
the
dear
creature
expecting
an
infant
and
without
a
penny
in
the
month
of
november
i
found
means
to
persuade
the
best
in
paris
to
play
the
part
of
a
humble
suburban
apothecary
i
induced
the
priest
of
the
parish
in
which
the
countess
was
living
to
supply
her
needs
as
though
he
were
performing
an
act
of
charity
then
to
hide
my
wife
to
secure
her
against
discovery
to
find
her
a
housekeeper
who
would
be
devoted
to
me
and
be
my
intelligent
confidante
it
was
a
task
worthy
of
figaro
you
may
suppose
that
to
discover
where
my
wife
had
taken
refuge
i
had
only
to
make
up
my
mind
to
it
after
three
months
of
desperation
rather
than
despair
the
idea
of
devoting
myself
to
honorine
with
god
only
in
my
secret
was
one
of
those
poems
which
occur
only
to
the
heart
of
a
lover
through
life
and
death
love
must
have
its
daily
food
and
ought
i
not
to
protect
this
child
whose
guilt
was
the
outcome
of
my
imprudence
against
fresh
disaster
to
fulfil
my
part
in
short
as
a
guardian
angel
at
the
age
of
seven
months
her
infant
died
happily
for
her
and
for
me
for
nine
months
more
my
wife
lay
between
life
and
death
deserted
at
the
time
when
she
most
needed
a
manly
arm
but
this
arm
said
he
holding
out
his
own
with
a
gesture
of
angelic
dignity
was
extended
over
her
head
honorine
was
nursed
as
she
would
have
been
in
her
own
home
when
on
her
recovery
she
asked
how
and
by
whom
she
had
been
assisted
she
was
told
by
the
sisters
of
charity
in
the
neighborhood
by
the
maternity
society
by
the
parish
priest
who
took
an
interest
in
this
woman
whose
pride
amounts
to
a
vice
has
shown
a
power
of
resistance
in
misfortune
which
on
some
evenings
i
call
the
obstinacy
of
a
mule
honorine
was
bent
on
earning
her
living
my
wife
works
for
five
years
past
i
have
lodged
her
in
the
rue
in
a
charming
little
house
where
she
makes
artificial
flowers
and
articles
of
fashion
she
believes
that
she
sells
the
product
of
her
elegant
fancywork
to
a
shop
where
she
is
so
well
paid
that
she
makes
twenty
francs
a
day
and
in
these
six
years
she
had
never
had
a
moment
s
suspicion
she
pays
for
everything
she
needs
at
about
the
third
of
its
value
so
that
on
six
thousand
francs
a
year
she
lives
as
if
she
had
fifteen
thousand
she
is
devoted
to
flowers
and
pays
a
hundred
crowns
to
a
gardener
who
costs
me
twelve
hundred
in
wages
and
sends
me
in
a
bill
for
two
thousand
francs
every
three
months
i
have
promised
the
man
a
with
a
house
on
it
close
to
the
porter
s
lodge
in
the
rue
i
hold
this
ground
in
the
name
of
a
clerk
of
the
law
courts
the
smallest
indiscretion
would
ruin
the
gardener
s
prospects
honorine
has
her
little
house
a
garden
and
a
splendid
hothouse
for
a
rent
of
five
hundred
francs
a
year
there
she
lives
under
the
name
of
her
housekeeper
madame
gobain
the
old
woman
of
impeccable
discretion
whom
i
was
so
lucky
as
to
find
and
whose
affection
honorine
has
won
but
her
zeal
like
that
of
the
gardener
is
kept
hot
by
the
promise
of
reward
at
the
moment
of
success
the
porter
and
his
wife
cost
me
dreadfully
dear
for
the
same
reasons
however
for
three
years
honorine
has
been
happy
believing
that
she
owes
to
her
own
toil
all
the
luxury
of
flowers
dress
and
comfort
oh
i
know
what
you
are
about
to
say
cried
the
count
seeing
a
question
in
my
eyes
and
on
my
lips
yes
yes
i
have
made
the
attempt
my
wife
was
formerly
living
in
the
faubourg
one
day
when
from
what
gobain
told
me
i
believed
in
some
chance
of
a
reconciliation
i
wrote
by
post
a
letter
in
which
i
tried
to
propitiate
my
wife
a
letter
written
and
twenty
times
i
will
not
describe
my
agonies
i
went
from
the
rue
payenne
to
the
rue
de
reuilly
like
a
condemned
wretch
going
from
the
palais
de
justice
to
his
execution
but
he
goes
on
a
cart
and
i
was
on
foot
it
was
dark
there
was
a
fog
i
went
to
meet
madame
gobain
who
was
to
come
and
tell
me
what
my
wife
had
done
honorine
on
recognizing
my
writing
had
thrown
the
letter
into
the
fire
without
reading
madame
gobain
she
had
exclaimed
i
leave
this
what
a
was
this
to
a
man
who
found
inexhaustible
pleasure
in
the
trickery
by
which
he
gets
the
finest
lyons
velvet
at
twelve
francs
a
yard
a
pheasant
a
fish
a
dish
of
fruit
for
a
tenth
of
their
value
for
a
woman
so
ignorant
as
to
believe
that
she
is
paying
ample
wages
with
two
hundred
and
fifty
francs
to
madame
gobain
a
cook
fit
for
a
bishop
you
have
sometimes
found
me
rubbing
my
hands
in
the
enjoyment
of
a
sort
of
happiness
well
i
had
just
succeeded
in
some
ruse
worthy
of
the
stage
i
had
just
deceived
my
wife
i
had
sent
her
by
a
purchaser
of
wardrobes
an
indian
shawl
to
be
offered
to
her
as
the
property
of
an
actress
who
had
hardly
worn
it
but
in
which
i
the
solemn
lawyer
whom
you
know
had
wrapped
myself
for
a
night
in
short
my
life
at
this
day
may
be
summed
up
in
the
two
words
which
express
the
extremes
of
torment
i
love
and
i
wait
i
have
in
madame
gobain
a
faithful
spy
on
the
heart
i
worship
i
go
every
evening
to
chat
with
the
old
woman
to
hear
from
her
all
that
honorine
has
done
during
the
day
the
lightest
word
she
has
spoken
for
a
single
exclamation
might
betray
to
me
the
secrets
of
that
soul
which
is
wilfully
deaf
and
dumb
honorine
is
pious
she
attends
the
church
services
and
prays
but
she
has
never
been
to
confession
or
taken
the
communion
she
foresees
what
a
priest
would
tell
her
she
will
not
listen
to
the
advice
to
the
injunction
that
she
should
return
to
me
this
horror
of
me
overwhelms
me
dismays
me
for
i
have
never
done
her
the
smallest
harm
i
have
always
been
kind
to
her
granting
even
that
i
may
have
been
a
little
hasty
when
teaching
her
that
my
man
s
irony
may
have
hurt
her
legitimate
girlish
pride
is
that
a
reason
for
persisting
in
a
determination
which
only
the
most
implacable
hatred
could
have
inspired
honorine
has
never
told
madame
gobain
who
she
is
she
keeps
absolute
silence
as
to
her
marriage
so
that
the
worthy
and
respectable
woman
can
never
speak
a
word
in
my
favor
for
she
is
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
knows
my
secret
the
others
know
nothing
they
live
under
the
awe
caused
by
the
name
of
the
prefect
of
police
and
their
respect
for
the
power
of
a
minister
hence
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
penetrate
that
heart
the
citadel
is
mine
but
i
can
not
get
into
it
i
have
not
a
single
means
of
action
an
act
of
violence
would
ruin
me
for
ever
how
can
i
argue
against
reasons
of
which
i
know
nothing
should
i
write
a
letter
and
have
it
copied
by
a
public
writer
and
laid
before
honorine
but
that
would
be
to
run
the
risk
of
a
third
removal
the
last
cost
me
fifty
thousand
francs
the
purchase
was
made
in
the
first
instance
in
the
name
of
the
secretary
whom
you
succeeded
the
unhappy
man
who
did
not
know
how
lightly
i
sleep
was
detected
by
me
in
the
act
of
opening
a
box
in
which
i
had
put
the
private
agreement
i
coughed
and
he
was
seized
with
a
panic
next
day
i
compelled
him
to
sell
the
house
to
the
man
in
whose
name
it
now
stands
and
i
turned
him
out
if
it
were
not
that
i
feel
all
my
noblest
faculties
as
a
man
satisfied
happy
expansive
if
the
part
i
am
playing
were
not
that
of
divine
fatherhood
if
i
did
not
drink
in
delight
by
every
pore
there
are
moments
when
i
should
believe
that
i
was
a
monomaniac
sometimes
at
night
i
hear
the
jingling
bells
of
madness
i
dread
the
violent
transitions
from
a
feeble
hope
which
sometimes
shines
and
flashes
up
to
complete
despair
falling
as
low
as
man
can
fall
a
few
days
since
i
was
seriously
considering
the
horrible
end
of
the
story
of
lovelace
and
clarissa
harlowe
and
saying
to
myself
if
honorine
were
the
mother
of
a
child
of
mine
must
she
not
necessarily
return
under
her
husband
s
roof
and
i
have
such
complete
faith
in
a
happy
future
that
ten
months
ago
i
bought
and
paid
for
one
of
the
handsomest
houses
in
the
faubourg
if
i
win
back
honorine
i
will
not
allow
her
to
see
this
house
again
nor
the
room
from
which
she
fled
i
mean
to
place
my
idol
in
a
new
temple
where
she
may
feel
that
life
is
altogether
new
that
house
is
being
made
a
marvel
of
elegance
and
taste
i
have
been
told
of
a
poet
who
being
almost
mad
with
love
for
an
actress
bought
the
handsomest
bed
in
paris
without
knowing
how
the
actress
would
reward
his
passion
well
one
of
the
coldest
of
lawyers
a
man
who
is
supposed
to
be
the
gravest
adviser
of
the
crown
was
stirred
to
the
depths
of
his
heart
by
that
anecdote
the
orator
of
the
legislative
chamber
can
understand
the
poet
who
fed
his
ideal
on
material
possibilities
three
days
before
the
arrival
of
maria
louisa
napoleon
flung
himself
on
his
wedding
bed
at
compiegne
all
stupendous
passions
have
the
same
impulses
i
love
as
a
poet
as
an
emperor
as
i
heard
the
last
words
i
believed
that
count
octave
s
fears
were
realized
he
had
risen
and
was
walking
up
and
down
and
gesticulating
but
he
stopped
as
if
shocked
by
the
vehemence
of
his
own
words
i
am
very
ridiculous
he
added
after
a
long
pause
looking
at
me
as
if
craving
a
glance
of
pity
no
monsieur
you
are
very
ah
yes
said
he
taking
up
the
thread
of
his
confidences
from
the
violence
of
my
speech
you
may
you
must
believe
in
the
intensity
of
a
physical
passion
which
for
nine
years
has
absorbed
all
my
faculties
but
that
is
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
worship
i
feel
for
the
soul
the
mind
the
heart
all
in
that
woman
the
enchanting
divinities
in
the
train
of
love
with
whom
we
pass
our
life
and
who
form
the
daily
poem
of
a
fugitive
delight
by
a
phenomenon
of
retrospection
i
see
now
the
graces
of
honorine
s
mind
and
heart
to
which
i
paid
little
heed
in
the
time
of
my
happiness
like
all
who
are
happy
from
day
to
day
i
have
appreciated
the
extent
of
my
loss
discovering
the
exquisite
gifts
of
that
capricious
and
refractory
young
creature
who
has
grown
so
strong
and
so
proud
under
the
heavy
hand
of
poverty
and
the
shock
of
the
most
cowardly
desertion
and
that
heavenly
blossom
is
fading
in
solitude
and
hiding
ah
the
law
of
which
we
were
speaking
he
went
on
with
bitter
irony
the
law
is
a
squad
of
gendarmes
my
wife
seized
and
dragged
away
by
force
would
not
that
be
to
triumph
over
a
corpse
religion
has
no
hold
on
her
she
craves
its
poetry
she
prays
but
she
does
not
listen
to
the
commandments
of
the
church
i
for
my
part
have
exhausted
everything
in
the
way
of
mercy
of
kindness
of
love
i
am
at
my
wits
end
only
one
chance
of
victory
is
left
to
me
the
cunning
and
patience
with
which
at
last
entrap
the
wariest
birds
the
swiftest
the
most
capricious
and
the
rarest
hence
maurice
when
de
grandville
s
indiscretion
betrayed
to
you
the
secret
of
my
life
i
ended
by
regarding
this
incident
as
one
of
the
decrees
of
fate
one
of
the
utterances
for
which
gamblers
listen
and
pray
in
the
midst
of
their
most
impassioned
play
have
you
enough
affection
for
me
to
show
me
romantic
devotion
i
see
what
you
are
coming
to
monsieur
le
comte
said
i
interrupting
him
i
guess
your
purpose
your
first
secretary
tried
to
open
your
deed
box
i
know
the
heart
of
your
second
he
might
fall
in
love
with
your
wife
and
can
you
devote
him
to
destruction
by
sending
him
into
the
fire
can
any
one
put
his
hand
into
a
brazier
without
burning
it
you
are
a
foolish
boy
replied
the
count
i
will
send
you
well
gloved
it
is
no
secretary
of
mine
that
will
be
lodged
in
the
rue
in
the
little
which
i
have
at
his
disposal
it
is
my
distant
cousin
baron
de
l
hostal
a
lawyer
high
in
office
after
a
moment
of
silent
surprise
i
heard
the
gate
bell
ring
and
a
carriage
came
into
the
courtyard
presently
the
footman
announced
madame
de
courteville
and
her
daughter
the
count
had
a
large
family
connection
on
his
mother
s
side
madame
de
courteville
his
cousin
was
the
widow
of
a
judge
on
the
bench
of
the
seine
division
who
had
left
her
a
daughter
and
no
fortune
whatever
what
could
a
woman
of
be
in
comparison
with
a
young
girl
of
twenty
as
lovely
as
imagination
could
wish
for
an
ideal
mistress
baron
and
master
of
appeals
till
you
get
something
better
and
this
old
house
settled
on
her
would
not
you
have
enough
good
reasons
for
not
falling
in
love
with
the
countess
he
said
to
me
in
a
whisper
as
he
took
me
by
the
hand
and
introduced
me
to
madame
de
courteville
and
her
daughter
i
was
dazzled
not
so
much
by
these
advantages
of
which
i
had
never
dreamed
but
by
amelie
de
courteville
whose
beauty
was
thrown
into
relief
by
one
of
those
toilets
which
a
mother
can
achieve
for
a
daughter
when
she
wants
to
see
her
married
but
i
will
not
talk
of
myself
said
the
consul
after
a
pause
three
weeks
later
i
went
to
live
in
the
gardener
s
cottage
which
had
been
cleaned
repaired
and
furnished
with
the
celerity
which
is
explained
by
three
words
paris
french
workmen
money
i
was
as
much
in
love
as
the
count
could
possibly
desire
as
a
security
would
the
prudence
of
a
young
man
of
be
equal
to
the
part
i
was
undertaking
involving
a
friend
s
happiness
to
settle
that
matter
i
may
confess
that
i
counted
very
much
on
my
uncle
s
advice
for
i
had
been
authorized
by
the
count
to
take
him
into
confidence
in
any
case
where
i
deemed
his
interference
necessary
i
engaged
a
garden
i
devoted
myself
to
horticulture
i
worked
frantically
like
a
man
whom
nothing
can
divert
turning
up
the
soil
of
the
and
appropriating
the
ground
to
the
culture
of
flowers
like
the
maniacs
of
england
or
of
holland
i
gave
it
out
that
i
was
devoted
to
one
kind
of
flower
and
especially
grew
dahlias
collecting
every
variety
you
will
understand
that
my
conduct
even
in
the
smallest
details
was
laid
down
for
me
by
the
count
whose
whole
intellectual
powers
were
directed
to
the
most
trifling
incidents
of
the
enacted
in
the
rue
as
soon
as
the
countess
had
gone
to
bed
at
about
eleven
at
night
octave
madame
gobain
and
i
sat
in
council
i
heard
the
old
woman
s
report
to
the
count
of
his
wife
s
least
proceedings
during
the
day
he
inquired
into
everything
her
meals
her
occupations
her
frame
of
mind
her
plans
for
the
morrow
the
flowers
she
proposed
to
imitate
i
understood
what
love
in
despair
may
be
when
it
is
the
threefold
passion
of
the
heart
the
mind
and
the
senses
octave
lived
only
for
that
hour
during
two
months
while
my
work
in
the
garden
lasted
i
never
set
eyes
on
the
little
house
where
my
fair
neighbor
dwelt
i
had
not
even
inquired
whether
i
had
a
neighbor
though
the
countess
garden
was
divided
from
mine
by
a
paling
along
which
she
had
planted
cypress
trees
already
four
feet
high
one
fine
morning
madame
gobain
announced
to
her
mistress
as
a
disastrous
piece
of
news
the
intention
expressed
by
an
eccentric
creature
who
had
become
her
neighbor
of
building
a
wall
between
the
two
gardens
at
the
end
of
the
year
i
will
say
nothing
of
the
curiosity
which
consumed
me
to
see
the
countess
the
wish
almost
extinguished
my
budding
love
for
amelie
de
courteville
my
scheme
for
building
a
wall
was
indeed
a
dangerous
threat
there
would
be
no
more
fresh
air
for
honorine
whose
garden
would
then
be
a
sort
of
narrow
alley
shut
in
between
my
wall
and
her
own
little
house
this
dwelling
formerly
a
summer
villa
was
like
a
house
of
cards
it
was
not
more
than
thirty
feet
deep
and
about
a
hundred
feet
long
the
garden
front
painted
in
the
german
fashion
imitated
a
trellis
with
flowers
up
to
the
second
floor
and
was
really
a
charming
example
of
the
pompadour
style
so
well
called
rococo
a
long
avenue
of
limes
led
up
to
it
the
gardens
of
the
pavilion
and
my
plot
of
ground
were
in
the
shape
of
a
hatchet
of
which
this
avenue
was
the
handle
my
wall
would
cut
away
of
the
hatchet
the
countess
was
in
despair
my
good
gobain
said
she
what
sort
of
man
is
this
florist
on
my
word
said
the
housekeeper
i
do
not
know
whether
it
will
be
possible
to
tame
him
he
seems
to
have
a
horror
of
women
he
is
the
nephew
of
a
paris
cure
i
have
seen
the
uncle
but
once
a
fine
old
man
of
sixty
very
ugly
but
very
amiable
it
is
quite
possible
that
this
priest
encourages
his
nephew
as
they
say
in
the
neighborhood
in
his
love
of
flowers
that
nothing
worse
may
happen
why
what
well
your
neighbor
is
a
little
cracked
said
gobain
tapping
her
head
now
a
harmless
lunatic
is
the
only
man
whom
no
woman
ever
distrusts
in
the
matter
of
sentiment
you
will
see
how
wise
the
count
had
been
in
choosing
this
disguise
for
me
what
ails
him
then
asked
the
countess
he
has
studied
too
hard
replied
gobain
he
has
turned
misanthropic
and
he
has
his
reasons
for
disliking
women
well
if
you
want
to
know
all
that
is
said
about
him
well
said
honorine
madmen
frighten
me
less
than
sane
folks
i
will
speak
to
him
myself
tell
him
that
i
beg
him
to
come
here
if
i
do
not
succeed
i
will
send
for
the
the
day
after
this
conversation
as
i
was
walking
along
my
graveled
path
i
caught
sight
of
the
curtains
on
the
first
floor
of
the
little
house
and
of
a
woman
s
face
curiously
peeping
out
madame
gobain
called
me
i
hastily
glanced
at
the
countess
house
and
by
a
rude
shrug
expressed
what
do
i
care
for
your
mistress
madame
said
gobain
called
upon
to
give
an
account
of
her
errand
the
madman
bid
me
leave
him
in
peace
saying
that
even
a
charcoal
seller
is
master
in
his
own
premises
especially
when
he
has
no
he
is
perfectly
right
said
the
countess
yes
but
he
ended
by
saying
i
will
go
when
i
told
him
that
he
would
greatly
distress
a
lady
living
in
retirement
who
found
her
greatest
solace
in
growing
next
day
a
signal
from
gobain
informed
me
that
i
was
expected
after
the
countess
breakfast
when
she
was
walking
to
and
fro
in
front
of
her
house
i
broke
out
some
palings
and
went
towards
her
i
had
dressed
myself
like
a
countryman
in
an
old
pair
of
gray
flannel
trousers
heavy
wooden
shoes
and
shabby
shooting
coat
a
peaked
cap
on
my
head
a
ragged
bandana
round
my
neck
hands
soiled
with
mould
and
a
dibble
in
my
hand
madame
said
the
housekeeper
this
good
man
is
your
the
countess
was
not
alarmed
i
saw
at
last
the
woman
whom
her
own
conduct
and
her
husband
s
confidences
had
made
me
so
curious
to
meet
it
was
in
the
early
days
of
may
the
air
was
pure
the
weather
serene
the
verdure
of
the
first
foliage
the
fragrance
of
spring
formed
a
setting
for
this
creature
of
sorrow
as
i
then
saw
honorine
i
understood
octave
s
passion
and
the
truthfulness
of
his
description
a
heavenly
flower
her
pallor
was
what
first
struck
me
by
its
peculiar
tone
of
white
for
there
are
as
many
tones
of
white
as
of
red
or
blue
on
looking
at
the
countess
the
eye
seemed
to
feel
that
tender
skin
where
the
blood
flowed
in
the
blue
veins
at
the
slightest
emotion
the
blood
mounted
under
the
surface
in
rosy
flushes
like
a
cloud
when
we
met
the
sunshine
filtering
through
the
light
foliage
of
the
acacias
shed
on
honorine
the
pale
gold
ambient
glory
in
which
raphael
and
titian
alone
of
all
painters
have
been
able
to
enwrap
the
virgin
her
brown
eyes
expressed
both
tenderness
and
vivacity
their
brightness
seemed
reflected
in
her
face
through
the
long
downcast
lashes
merely
by
lifting
her
delicate
eyelids
honorine
could
cast
a
spell
there
was
so
much
feeling
dignity
terror
or
contempt
in
her
way
of
raising
or
dropping
those
veils
of
the
soul
she
could
freeze
or
give
life
by
a
look
her
hair
carelessly
knotted
on
her
head
outlined
a
poet
s
brow
high
powerful
and
dreamy
the
mouth
was
wholly
voluptuous
and
to
crown
all
by
a
grace
rare
in
france
though
common
in
italy
all
the
lines
and
forms
of
the
head
had
a
stamp
of
nobleness
which
would
defy
the
outrages
of
time
though
slight
honorine
was
not
thin
and
her
figure
struck
me
as
being
one
that
might
revive
love
when
it
believed
itself
exhausted
she
perfectly
represented
the
idea
conveyed
by
the
word
for
she
was
one
of
those
pliant
little
women
who
allow
themselves
to
be
taken
up
petted
set
down
and
taken
up
again
like
a
kitten
her
small
feet
as
i
heard
them
on
the
gravel
made
a
light
sound
essentially
their
own
that
harmonized
with
the
rustle
of
her
dress
producing
a
feminine
music
which
stamped
itself
on
the
heart
and
remained
distinct
from
the
footfall
of
a
thousand
other
women
her
gait
bore
all
the
quarterings
of
her
race
with
so
much
pride
that
in
the
street
the
least
respectful
working
man
would
have
made
way
for
her
gay
and
tender
haughty
and
imposing
it
was
impossible
to
understand
her
excepting
as
gifted
with
these
apparently
incompatible
qualities
which
nevertheless
had
left
her
still
a
child
but
it
was
a
child
who
might
be
as
strong
as
an
angel
and
like
the
angel
once
hurt
in
her
nature
she
would
be
implacable
coldness
on
that
face
must
no
doubt
be
death
to
those
on
whom
her
eyes
had
smiled
for
whom
her
set
lips
had
parted
for
those
whose
soul
had
drunk
in
the
melody
of
that
voice
lending
to
her
words
the
poetry
of
song
by
its
peculiar
intonation
inhaling
the
perfume
of
violets
that
accompanied
her
i
understood
how
the
memory
of
this
wife
had
arrested
the
count
on
the
threshold
of
debauchery
and
how
impossible
it
would
be
ever
to
forget
a
creature
who
really
was
a
flower
to
the
touch
a
flower
to
the
eye
a
flower
of
fragrance
a
heavenly
flower
to
the
soul
honorine
inspired
devotion
chivalrous
devotion
regardless
of
reward
a
man
on
seeing
her
must
say
to
himself
think
and
i
will
divine
your
thought
speak
and
i
will
obey
if
my
life
sacrificed
in
torments
can
procure
you
one
day
s
happiness
take
my
life
i
will
smile
like
a
martyr
at
the
stake
for
i
shall
offer
that
day
to
god
as
a
token
to
which
a
father
responds
on
recognizing
a
gift
to
his
many
women
study
their
expression
and
succeed
in
producing
effects
similar
to
those
which
would
have
struck
you
at
first
sight
of
the
countess
only
in
her
it
was
all
the
outcome
of
a
delightful
nature
that
inimitable
nature
went
at
once
to
the
heart
if
i
tell
you
all
this
it
is
because
her
soul
her
thoughts
the
exquisiteness
of
her
heart
are
all
we
are
concerned
with
and
you
would
have
blamed
me
if
i
had
not
sketched
them
for
you
i
was
very
near
forgetting
my
part
as
a
lout
clumsy
and
by
no
means
chivalrous
i
am
told
madame
that
you
are
fond
of
flowers
i
am
an
artificial
said
she
after
growing
flowers
i
imitate
them
like
a
mother
who
is
artist
enough
to
have
the
pleasure
of
painting
her
children
that
is
enough
to
tell
you
that
i
am
poor
and
unable
to
pay
for
the
concession
i
am
anxious
to
obtain
from
you
but
how
said
i
as
grave
as
a
judge
can
a
lady
of
such
rank
as
yours
would
seem
to
be
ply
so
humble
a
calling
have
you
like
me
good
reasons
for
employing
your
fingers
so
as
to
keep
your
brains
from
working
let
us
stick
to
the
question
of
the
wall
said
she
with
a
smile
why
we
have
begun
at
the
foundations
said
i
must
not
i
know
which
of
us
ought
to
yield
to
the
other
in
behalf
of
our
suffering
or
if
you
choose
of
our
mania
oh
what
a
charming
clump
of
narcissus
they
are
as
fresh
as
this
spring
morning
i
assure
you
she
had
made
for
herself
a
perfect
museum
of
flowers
and
shrubs
which
none
might
see
but
the
sun
and
of
which
the
arrangement
had
been
prompted
by
the
genius
of
an
artist
the
most
heartless
of
landlords
must
have
treated
it
with
respect
the
masses
of
plants
arranged
according
to
their
height
or
in
single
clumps
were
really
a
joy
to
the
soul
this
retired
and
solitary
garden
breathed
comforting
scents
and
suggested
none
but
sweet
thoughts
and
graceful
nay
voluptuous
pictures
on
it
was
set
that
inscrutable
which
our
true
character
stamps
on
everything
as
soon
as
nothing
compels
us
to
obey
the
various
hypocrisies
necessary
as
they
are
which
society
insists
on
i
looked
alternately
at
the
mass
of
narcissus
and
at
the
countess
affecting
to
be
far
more
in
love
with
the
flowers
than
with
her
to
carry
out
my
part
so
you
are
very
fond
of
flowers
said
she
they
are
i
replied
the
only
beings
that
never
disappoint
our
cares
and
and
i
went
on
to
deliver
such
a
diatribe
while
comparing
botany
and
the
world
that
we
ended
miles
away
from
the
dividing
wall
and
the
countess
must
have
supposed
me
to
be
a
wretched
and
wounded
sufferer
worthy
of
her
pity
however
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
my
neighbor
naturally
brought
me
back
to
the
point
for
women
when
they
are
not
in
love
have
all
the
cold
blood
of
an
experienced
attorney
if
you
insist
on
my
leaving
the
paling
said
i
you
will
learn
all
the
secrets
of
gardening
that
i
want
to
hide
i
am
seeking
to
grow
a
blue
dahlia
a
blue
rose
i
am
crazy
for
blue
flowers
is
not
blue
the
favorite
color
of
superior
souls
we
are
neither
of
us
really
at
home
we
might
as
well
make
a
little
door
of
open
railings
to
unite
our
gardens
you
too
are
fond
of
flowers
you
will
see
mine
i
shall
see
yours
if
you
receive
no
visitors
at
all
i
for
my
part
have
none
but
my
uncle
the
cure
of
the
white
no
said
she
i
will
give
you
the
right
to
come
into
my
garden
my
premises
at
any
hour
come
and
welcome
you
will
always
be
admitted
as
a
neighbor
with
whom
i
hope
to
keep
on
good
terms
but
i
like
my
solitude
too
well
to
burden
it
with
any
loss
of
as
you
please
said
i
and
with
one
leap
i
was
over
the
paling
now
of
what
use
would
a
door
be
said
i
from
my
own
domain
turning
round
to
the
countess
and
mocking
her
with
a
madman
s
gesture
and
grimace
for
a
fortnight
i
seemed
to
take
no
heed
of
my
neighbor
towards
the
end
of
may
one
lovely
evening
we
happened
both
to
be
out
on
opposite
sides
of
the
paling
both
walking
slowly
having
reached
the
end
we
could
not
help
exchanging
a
few
civil
words
she
found
me
in
such
deep
dejection
lost
in
such
painful
meditations
that
she
spoke
to
me
of
hopefulness
in
brief
sentences
that
sounded
like
the
songs
with
which
nurses
lull
their
babies
i
then
leaped
the
fence
and
found
myself
for
the
second
time
at
her
side
the
countess
led
me
into
the
house
wishing
to
subdue
my
sadness
so
at
last
i
had
penetrated
the
sanctuary
where
everything
was
in
harmony
with
the
woman
i
have
tried
to
describe
to
you
exquisite
simplicity
reigned
there
the
interior
of
the
little
house
was
just
such
a
dainty
box
as
the
art
of
the
eighteenth
century
devised
for
the
pretty
profligacy
of
a
fine
gentleman
the
on
the
ground
floor
was
painted
in
fresco
with
garlands
of
flowers
admirably
and
marvelously
executed
the
staircase
was
charmingly
decorated
in
monochrome
the
little
opposite
the
was
very
much
faded
but
the
countess
had
hung
it
with
panels
of
tapestry
of
fanciful
designs
taken
off
old
screens
a
came
next
upstairs
there
was
but
one
bedroom
with
a
and
a
library
which
she
used
as
her
workroom
the
kitchen
was
beneath
in
the
basement
on
which
the
house
was
raised
for
there
was
a
flight
of
several
steps
outside
the
balustrade
of
a
balcony
in
garlands
a
la
pompadour
concealed
the
roof
only
the
lead
cornices
were
visible
in
this
retreat
one
was
a
hundred
leagues
from
paris
but
for
the
bitter
smile
which
occasionally
played
on
the
beautiful
red
lips
of
this
pale
woman
it
would
have
been
possible
to
believe
that
this
violet
buried
in
her
thicket
of
flowers
was
happy
in
a
few
days
we
had
reached
a
certain
degree
of
intimacy
the
result
of
our
close
neighborhood
and
of
the
countess
conviction
that
i
was
indifferent
to
women
a
look
would
have
spoilt
all
and
i
never
allowed
a
thought
of
her
to
be
seen
in
my
eyes
honorine
chose
to
regard
me
as
an
old
friend
her
manner
to
me
was
the
outcome
of
a
kind
of
pity
her
looks
her
voice
her
words
all
showed
that
she
was
a
hundred
miles
away
from
the
coquettish
airs
which
the
strictest
virtue
might
have
allowed
under
such
circumstances
she
soon
gave
me
the
right
to
go
into
the
pretty
workshop
where
she
made
her
flowers
a
retreat
full
of
books
and
curiosities
as
smart
as
a
boudoir
where
elegance
emphasized
the
vulgarity
of
the
tools
of
her
trade
the
countess
had
in
the
course
of
time
poetized
as
i
may
say
a
thing
which
is
at
the
antipodes
to
poetry
a
manufacture
perhaps
of
all
the
work
a
woman
can
do
the
making
of
artificial
flowers
is
that
of
which
the
details
allow
her
to
display
most
grace
for
coloring
prints
she
must
sit
bent
over
a
table
and
devote
herself
with
some
attention
to
this
half
painting
embroidering
tapestry
as
diligently
as
a
woman
must
who
is
to
earn
her
living
by
it
entails
consumption
or
curvature
of
the
spine
engraving
music
is
one
of
the
most
laborious
by
the
care
the
minute
exactitude
and
the
intelligence
it
demands
sewing
and
white
embroidery
do
not
earn
thirty
sous
a
day
but
the
making
of
flowers
and
light
articles
of
wear
necessitates
a
variety
of
movements
gestures
ideas
even
which
do
not
take
a
pretty
woman
out
of
her
sphere
she
is
still
herself
she
may
chat
laugh
sing
or
think
there
was
certainly
a
feeling
for
art
in
the
way
in
which
the
countess
arranged
on
a
long
deal
table
the
petals
which
were
used
in
composing
the
flowers
she
was
to
produce
the
saucers
of
color
were
of
white
china
and
always
clean
arranged
in
such
order
that
the
eye
could
at
once
see
the
required
shade
in
the
scale
of
tints
thus
the
aristocratic
artist
saved
time
a
pretty
little
cabinet
with
a
hundred
tiny
drawers
of
ebony
inlaid
with
ivory
contained
the
little
steel
moulds
in
which
she
shaped
the
leaves
and
some
forms
of
petals
a
fine
japanese
bowl
held
the
paste
which
was
never
allowed
to
turn
sour
and
it
had
a
fitted
cover
with
a
hinge
so
easy
that
she
could
lift
it
with
a
the
wire
of
iron
and
brass
lurked
in
a
little
drawer
of
the
table
before
her
under
her
eyes
in
a
venetian
glass
shaped
like
a
on
its
stem
was
the
living
model
she
strove
to
imitate
she
had
a
passion
for
achievement
she
attempted
the
most
difficult
things
close
racemes
the
tiniest
corollas
heaths
nectaries
of
the
most
variegated
hues
her
hands
as
swift
as
her
thoughts
went
from
the
table
to
the
flower
she
was
making
as
those
of
an
accomplished
pianist
fly
over
the
keys
her
fingers
seemed
to
be
fairies
to
use
perrault
s
expression
so
infinite
were
the
different
actions
of
twisting
fitting
and
pressure
needed
for
the
work
all
hidden
under
grace
of
movement
while
she
adapted
each
motion
to
the
result
with
the
lucidity
of
instinct
i
could
not
tire
of
admiring
her
as
she
shaped
a
flower
from
the
materials
sorted
before
her
padding
the
wire
stem
and
adjusting
the
leaves
she
displayed
the
genius
of
a
painter
in
her
bold
attempts
she
copied
faded
flowers
and
yellowing
leaves
she
struggled
even
with
wildflowers
the
most
artless
of
all
and
the
most
elaborate
in
their
simplicity
this
art
she
would
say
is
in
its
infancy
if
the
women
of
paris
had
a
little
of
the
genius
which
the
slavery
of
the
harem
brings
out
in
oriental
women
they
would
lend
a
complete
language
of
flowers
to
the
wreaths
they
wear
on
their
head
to
please
my
own
taste
as
an
artist
i
have
made
drooping
flowers
with
leaves
of
the
hue
of
florentine
bronze
such
as
are
found
before
or
after
the
winter
would
not
such
a
crown
on
the
head
of
a
young
woman
whose
life
is
a
failure
have
a
certain
poetical
fitness
how
many
things
a
woman
might
express
by
her
are
there
not
flowers
for
drunken
bacchantes
flowers
for
gloomy
and
stern
bigots
pensive
flowers
for
women
who
are
bored
botany
i
believe
may
be
made
to
express
every
sensation
and
thought
of
the
soul
even
the
most
she
would
employ
me
to
stamp
out
the
leaves
cut
up
material
and
prepare
wires
for
the
stems
my
affected
desire
for
occupation
made
me
soon
skilful
we
talked
as
we
worked
when
i
had
nothing
to
do
i
read
new
books
to
her
for
i
had
my
part
to
keep
up
as
a
man
weary
of
life
worn
out
with
griefs
gloomy
sceptical
and
soured
my
person
led
to
adorable
banter
as
to
my
purely
physical
resemblance
with
the
exception
of
his
club
foot
to
lord
byron
it
was
tacitly
acknowledged
that
her
own
troubles
as
to
which
she
kept
the
most
profound
silence
far
outweighed
mine
though
the
causes
i
assigned
for
my
misanthropy
might
have
satisfied
young
or
job
i
will
say
nothing
of
the
feelings
of
shame
which
tormented
me
as
i
inflicted
on
my
heart
like
the
beggars
in
the
street
false
wounds
to
excite
the
compassion
of
that
enchanting
woman
i
soon
appreciated
the
extent
of
my
devotedness
by
learning
to
estimate
the
baseness
of
a
spy
the
expressions
of
sympathy
bestowed
on
me
would
have
comforted
the
greatest
grief
this
charming
creature
weaned
from
the
world
and
for
so
many
years
alone
having
besides
love
treasures
of
kindliness
to
bestow
offered
these
to
me
with
childlike
effusiveness
and
such
compassion
as
would
inevitably
have
filled
with
bitterness
any
profligate
who
should
have
fallen
in
love
with
her
for
alas
it
was
all
charity
all
sheer
pity
her
renunciation
of
love
her
dread
of
what
is
called
happiness
for
women
she
proclaimed
with
equal
vehemence
and
candor
these
happy
days
proved
to
me
that
a
woman
s
friendship
is
far
superior
to
her
love
i
suffered
the
revelations
of
my
sorrows
to
be
dragged
from
me
with
as
many
grimaces
as
a
young
lady
allows
herself
before
sitting
down
to
the
piano
so
conscious
are
they
of
the
annoyance
that
will
follow
as
you
may
imagine
the
necessity
for
overcoming
my
dislike
to
speak
had
induced
the
countess
to
strengthen
the
bonds
of
our
intimacy
but
she
found
in
me
so
exact
a
counterpart
of
her
own
antipathy
to
love
that
i
fancied
she
was
well
content
with
the
chance
which
had
brought
to
her
desert
island
a
sort
of
man
friday
solitude
was
perhaps
beginning
to
weigh
on
her
at
the
same
time
there
was
nothing
of
the
coquette
in
her
nothing
survived
of
the
woman
she
did
not
feel
that
she
had
a
heart
she
told
me
excepting
in
the
ideal
world
where
she
found
refuge
i
involuntarily
compared
these
two
lives
hers
and
the
count
s
his
all
activity
agitation
and
emotion
hers
all
inaction
quiescence
and
stagnation
the
woman
and
the
man
were
admirably
obedient
to
their
nature
my
misanthropy
allowed
me
to
utter
cynical
sallies
against
men
and
women
both
and
i
indulged
in
them
hoping
to
bring
honorine
to
the
confidential
point
but
she
was
not
to
be
caught
in
any
trap
and
i
began
to
understand
that
mulish
obstinacy
which
is
commoner
among
women
than
is
generally
supposed
the
orientals
are
right
i
said
to
her
one
evening
when
they
shut
you
up
and
regard
you
merely
as
the
playthings
of
their
pleasure
europe
has
been
well
punished
for
having
admitted
you
to
form
an
element
of
society
and
for
accepting
you
on
an
equal
footing
in
my
opinion
woman
is
the
most
dishonorable
and
cowardly
being
to
be
found
nay
and
that
is
where
her
charm
lies
where
would
be
the
pleasure
of
hunting
a
tame
thing
when
once
a
woman
has
inspired
a
man
s
passion
she
is
to
him
for
ever
sacred
in
his
eyes
she
is
hedged
round
by
an
imprescriptible
prerogative
in
men
gratitude
for
past
delights
is
eternal
though
he
should
find
his
mistress
grown
old
or
unworthy
the
woman
still
has
rights
over
his
heart
but
to
you
women
the
man
you
have
loved
is
as
nothing
to
you
nay
more
he
is
unpardonable
in
one
thing
he
lives
on
you
dare
not
own
it
but
you
all
have
in
your
hearts
the
feeling
which
that
popular
calumny
called
tradition
ascribes
to
the
lady
of
the
tour
de
nesle
what
a
pity
it
is
that
we
can
not
live
on
love
as
we
live
on
fruit
and
that
when
we
have
had
our
fill
nothing
should
survive
but
the
remembrance
of
pleasure
god
has
no
doubt
reserved
such
perfect
bliss
for
paradise
said
she
but
she
added
if
your
argument
seems
to
you
very
witty
to
me
it
has
the
disadvantage
of
being
false
what
can
those
women
be
who
give
themselves
up
to
a
succession
of
loves
she
asked
looking
at
me
as
the
virgin
in
ingres
picture
looks
at
louis
xiii
offering
her
his
kingdom
you
are
an
actress
in
good
faith
said
i
for
you
gave
me
a
look
just
now
which
would
make
the
fame
of
an
actress
still
lovely
as
you
are
you
have
loved
you
i
she
exclaimed
evading
my
question
i
am
not
a
woman
i
am
a
nun
and
years
old
then
how
can
you
so
positively
assert
that
you
feel
more
keenly
than
i
sorrow
has
but
one
form
for
women
the
only
misfortunes
they
regard
are
disappointments
of
the
she
looked
at
me
sweetly
and
like
all
women
when
stuck
between
the
issues
of
a
dilemma
or
held
in
the
clutches
of
truth
she
persisted
nevertheless
in
her
wilfulness
i
am
a
nun
she
said
and
you
talk
to
me
of
the
world
where
i
shall
never
again
set
not
even
in
thought
said
i
is
the
world
so
much
to
be
desired
she
replied
oh
when
my
mind
wanders
it
goes
higher
the
angel
of
perfection
the
beautiful
angel
gabriel
often
sings
in
my
heart
if
i
were
rich
i
should
work
all
the
same
to
keep
me
from
soaring
too
often
on
the
wings
of
the
angel
and
wandering
in
the
world
of
fancy
there
are
meditations
which
are
the
ruin
of
us
women
i
owe
much
peace
of
mind
to
my
flowers
though
sometimes
they
fail
to
occupy
me
on
some
days
i
find
my
soul
invaded
by
a
purposeless
expectancy
i
can
not
banish
some
idea
which
takes
possession
of
me
which
seems
to
make
my
fingers
clumsy
i
feel
that
some
great
event
is
impending
that
my
life
is
about
to
change
i
listen
vaguely
i
stare
into
the
darkness
i
have
no
liking
for
my
work
and
after
a
thousand
fatigues
i
find
life
once
more
everyday
life
is
this
a
warning
from
heaven
i
ask
myself
after
three
months
of
this
struggle
between
two
diplomates
concealed
under
the
semblance
of
youthful
melancholy
and
a
woman
whose
disgust
of
life
made
her
invulnerable
i
told
the
count
that
it
was
impossible
to
drag
this
tortoise
out
of
her
shell
it
must
be
broken
the
evening
before
in
our
last
quite
friendly
discussion
the
countess
had
exclaimed
lucretia
s
dagger
wrote
in
letters
of
blood
the
watchword
of
woman
s
charter
from
that
moment
the
count
left
me
free
to
act
i
have
been
paid
a
hundred
francs
for
the
flowers
and
caps
i
made
this
week
honorine
exclaimed
gleefully
one
saturday
evening
when
i
went
to
visit
her
in
the
little
on
the
ground
floor
which
the
unavowed
proprietor
had
had
regilt
it
was
ten
o
clock
the
twilight
of
july
and
a
glorious
moon
lent
us
their
misty
light
gusts
of
mingled
perfumes
soothed
the
soul
the
countess
was
clinking
in
her
hand
the
five
gold
pieces
given
to
her
by
a
supposititious
dealer
in
fashionable
frippery
another
of
octave
s
accomplices
found
for
him
by
a
judge
popinot
i
earn
my
living
by
amusing
myself
said
she
i
am
free
when
men
armed
with
their
laws
have
tried
to
make
us
slaves
oh
i
have
transports
of
pride
every
saturday
in
short
i
like
gaudissart
s
gold
pieces
as
much
as
lord
byron
your
double
liked
murray
this
is
not
becoming
in
a
woman
said
i
pooh
am
i
a
woman
i
am
a
boy
gifted
with
a
soft
soul
that
is
all
a
boy
whom
no
woman
can
torture
your
life
is
the
negation
of
your
whole
being
i
replied
what
you
on
whom
god
has
lavished
his
choicest
treasures
of
love
and
beauty
do
you
never
wish
for
what
said
she
somewhat
disturbed
by
a
speech
which
for
the
first
time
gave
the
lie
to
the
part
i
had
assumed
for
a
pretty
little
child
with
curling
hair
running
playing
among
the
flowers
like
a
flower
itself
of
life
and
love
and
calling
you
mother
i
waited
for
an
answer
a
too
prolonged
silence
led
me
to
perceive
the
terrible
effect
of
my
words
though
the
darkness
at
first
concealed
it
leaning
on
her
sofa
the
countess
had
not
indeed
fainted
but
frozen
under
a
nervous
attack
of
which
the
first
chill
as
gentle
as
everything
that
was
part
of
her
felt
as
she
afterwards
said
like
the
influence
of
a
most
insidious
poison
i
called
madame
gobain
who
came
and
led
away
her
mistress
laid
her
on
her
bed
unlaced
her
undressed
her
and
restored
her
not
to
life
it
is
true
but
to
the
consciousness
of
some
dreadful
suffering
i
meanwhile
walked
up
and
down
the
path
behind
the
house
weeping
and
doubting
my
success
i
only
wished
to
give
up
this
part
of
the
which
i
had
so
rashly
assumed
madame
gobain
who
came
down
and
found
me
with
my
face
wet
with
tears
hastily
went
up
again
to
say
to
the
countess
what
has
happened
madame
monsieur
maurice
is
crying
like
a
roused
to
action
by
the
evil
interpretation
that
might
be
put
on
our
mutual
behavior
she
summoned
superhuman
strength
to
put
on
a
wrapper
and
come
down
to
me
you
are
not
the
cause
of
this
attack
said
she
i
am
subject
to
these
spasms
a
sort
of
cramp
of
the
heart
and
will
you
not
tell
me
of
your
troubles
said
i
in
a
voice
which
can
not
be
affected
as
i
wiped
away
my
tears
have
you
not
just
now
told
me
that
you
have
been
a
mother
and
have
been
so
unhappy
as
to
lose
your
child
marie
she
called
as
she
rang
the
bell
gobain
came
in
bring
lights
and
some
tea
said
she
with
the
calm
decision
of
a
mylady
clothed
in
the
armor
of
pride
by
the
dreadful
english
training
which
you
know
too
well
when
the
housekeeper
had
lighted
the
tapers
and
closed
the
shutters
the
countess
showed
me
a
mute
countenance
her
indomitable
pride
and
gravity
worthy
of
a
savage
had
already
reasserted
their
mastery
she
said
do
you
know
why
i
like
lord
byron
so
much
it
is
because
he
suffered
as
animals
do
of
what
use
are
complaints
when
they
are
not
an
elegy
like
manfred
s
nor
bitter
mockery
like
don
juan
s
nor
a
reverie
like
childe
harold
s
nothing
shall
be
known
of
me
my
heart
is
a
poem
that
i
lay
before
if
i
chose
said
i
if
she
repeated
i
have
no
interest
in
anything
i
replied
so
i
can
not
be
inquisitive
but
if
i
chose
i
could
know
all
your
secrets
by
i
defy
you
she
exclaimed
with
uneasiness
seriously
certainly
said
she
tossing
her
head
if
such
a
crime
is
possible
i
ought
to
know
in
the
first
place
madame
i
went
on
pointing
to
her
hands
those
pretty
fingers
which
are
enough
to
show
that
you
are
not
a
mere
girl
were
they
made
for
toil
then
you
call
yourself
madame
gobain
you
who
in
my
presence
the
other
day
on
receiving
a
letter
said
to
marie
here
this
is
for
you
marie
is
the
real
madame
gobain
so
you
conceal
your
name
behind
that
of
your
fear
nothing
madame
from
me
you
have
in
me
the
most
devoted
friend
you
will
ever
have
friend
do
you
understand
me
i
give
this
word
its
sacred
and
pathetic
meaning
so
profaned
in
france
where
we
apply
it
to
our
enemies
and
your
friend
who
will
defend
you
against
everything
only
wishes
that
you
should
be
as
happy
as
such
a
woman
ought
to
be
who
can
tell
whether
the
pain
i
have
involuntarily
caused
you
was
not
a
voluntary
act
yes
replied
she
with
threatening
audacity
i
insist
on
it
be
curious
and
tell
me
all
that
you
can
find
out
about
me
but
and
she
held
up
her
finger
you
must
also
tell
me
by
what
means
you
obtain
your
information
the
preservation
of
the
small
happiness
i
enjoy
here
depends
on
the
steps
you
that
means
that
you
will
fly
on
wings
she
cried
to
the
new
world
where
you
will
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
brutal
passions
you
will
inspire
said
i
interrupting
her
is
it
not
the
very
essence
of
genius
and
beauty
to
shine
to
attract
men
s
gaze
to
excite
desires
and
evil
thoughts
paris
is
a
desert
with
bedouins
paris
is
the
only
place
in
the
world
where
those
who
must
work
for
their
livelihood
can
hide
their
life
what
have
you
to
complain
of
who
am
i
an
additional
servant
gobain
that
is
all
if
you
have
to
fight
a
duel
you
may
need
a
never
mind
find
out
who
i
am
i
have
already
said
that
i
insist
now
i
beg
that
you
will
she
went
on
with
the
grace
which
you
ladies
have
at
command
said
the
consul
looking
at
the
ladies
well
then
at
the
same
hour
i
will
tell
you
what
i
may
have
discovered
replied
i
but
do
not
therefore
hate
me
will
you
behave
like
other
women
what
do
other
women
do
they
lay
upon
us
immense
sacrifices
and
when
we
have
made
them
they
reproach
us
for
it
some
time
later
as
if
it
were
an
they
are
right
if
the
thing
required
appears
to
be
a
sacrifice
replied
she
pointedly
instead
of
sacrifices
say
efforts
and
it
would
be
an
impertinence
said
she
forgive
me
said
i
i
forget
that
woman
and
the
pope
are
good
heavens
said
she
after
a
long
pause
only
two
words
would
be
enough
to
destroy
the
peace
so
dearly
bought
and
which
i
enjoy
like
a
fraud
she
rose
and
paid
no
further
heed
to
me
where
can
i
go
she
said
what
is
to
become
of
me
must
i
leave
this
quiet
retreat
that
i
had
arranged
with
such
care
to
end
my
days
in
to
end
your
days
exclaimed
i
with
visible
alarm
has
it
never
struck
you
that
a
time
would
come
when
you
could
no
longer
work
when
competition
will
lower
the
price
of
flowers
and
articles
of
fashion
i
have
already
saved
a
thousand
crowns
she
said
heavens
what
privations
such
a
sum
must
represent
i
exclaimed
leave
me
said
she
till
this
evening
i
am
not
myself
i
must
be
alone
must
i
not
save
my
strength
in
case
of
disaster
for
if
you
should
learn
anything
others
besides
you
would
be
informed
and
then
she
added
shortly
dismissing
me
with
an
imperious
gesture
the
battle
is
then
i
replied
with
a
smile
to
keep
up
the
appearance
of
indifference
i
had
given
to
the
scene
but
as
i
went
down
the
avenue
i
repeated
the
words
the
battle
is
octave
s
anxiety
was
equal
to
honorine
s
the
count
and
i
remained
together
till
two
in
the
morning
walking
to
and
fro
by
the
trenches
of
the
bastille
like
two
generals
who
on
the
eve
of
a
battle
calculate
all
the
chances
examine
the
ground
and
perceive
that
the
victory
must
depend
on
an
opportunity
to
be
seized
through
the
fight
these
two
divided
beings
would
each
lie
awake
one
in
the
hope
the
other
in
agonizing
dread
of
reunion
the
real
dramas
of
life
are
not
in
circumstances
but
in
feelings
they
are
played
in
the
heart
or
if
you
please
in
that
vast
realm
which
we
ought
to
call
the
spiritual
world
octave
and
honorine
moved
and
lived
altogether
in
the
world
of
lofty
spirits
i
was
punctual
at
ten
next
evening
i
was
for
the
first
time
shown
into
a
charming
bedroom
furnished
with
white
and
blue
the
nest
of
this
wounded
dove
the
countess
looked
at
me
and
was
about
to
speak
but
was
stricken
dumb
by
my
respectful
demeanor
madame
la
comtesse
said
i
with
a
grave
smile
the
poor
woman
who
had
risen
dropped
back
into
her
chair
and
remained
there
sunk
in
an
attitude
of
grief
which
i
should
have
liked
to
see
perpetuated
by
a
great
painter
you
are
i
went
on
the
wife
of
the
noblest
and
most
highly
respected
of
men
of
a
man
who
is
acknowledged
to
be
great
but
who
is
far
greater
in
his
conduct
to
you
than
he
is
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
you
and
he
are
two
lofty
where
do
you
suppose
yourself
to
be
living
i
asked
her
in
my
own
house
she
replied
opening
her
eyes
with
a
wide
stare
of
astonishment
in
count
octave
s
i
replied
you
have
been
tricked
lenormand
the
usher
of
the
court
is
not
the
real
owner
he
is
only
a
screen
for
your
husband
the
delightful
seclusion
you
enjoy
is
the
count
s
work
the
money
you
earn
is
paid
by
him
and
his
protection
extends
to
the
most
trivial
details
of
your
existence
your
husband
has
saved
you
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
he
has
assigned
plausible
reasons
for
your
disappearance
he
professes
to
hope
that
you
were
not
lost
in
the
wreck
of
the
the
ship
in
which
you
sailed
for
havana
to
secure
the
fortune
to
be
left
to
you
by
an
old
aunt
who
might
have
forgotten
you
you
embarked
escorted
by
two
ladies
of
her
family
and
an
old
the
count
says
that
he
has
sent
agents
to
various
spots
and
received
letters
which
give
him
great
hopes
he
takes
as
many
precautions
to
hide
you
from
all
eyes
as
you
take
yourself
in
short
he
obeys
you
that
is
enough
she
said
i
want
to
know
but
one
thing
more
from
whom
have
you
obtained
all
these
details
well
madame
my
uncle
got
a
place
for
a
penniless
youth
as
secretary
to
the
commissary
of
police
in
this
part
of
paris
that
young
man
told
me
everything
if
you
leave
this
house
this
evening
however
stealthily
your
husband
will
know
where
you
are
gone
and
his
care
will
follow
you
how
could
a
woman
so
clever
as
you
are
believe
that
shopkeepers
buy
flowers
and
caps
as
dear
as
they
sell
them
ask
a
thousand
crowns
for
a
bouquet
and
you
will
get
it
no
mother
s
tenderness
was
ever
more
ingenious
than
your
husband
s
i
have
learned
from
the
porter
of
this
house
that
the
count
often
comes
behind
the
fence
when
all
are
asleep
to
see
the
glimmer
of
your
nightlight
your
large
cashmere
shawl
cost
six
thousand
francs
your
brings
you
as
second
hand
things
fresh
from
the
best
makers
in
short
you
are
living
here
like
venus
in
the
toils
of
vulcan
but
you
are
alone
in
your
prison
by
the
devices
of
a
sublime
magnanimity
sublime
for
seven
years
past
and
at
every
the
countess
was
trembling
as
a
trapped
swallow
trembles
while
as
you
hold
it
in
your
hand
it
strains
its
neck
to
look
about
it
with
wild
eyes
she
shook
with
a
nervous
spasm
studying
me
with
a
defiant
look
her
dry
eyes
glittered
with
a
light
that
was
almost
hot
still
she
was
a
woman
the
moment
came
when
her
tears
forced
their
way
and
she
wept
not
because
she
was
touched
but
because
she
was
helpless
they
were
tears
of
desperation
she
had
believed
herself
independent
and
free
marriage
weighed
on
her
as
the
prison
cell
does
on
the
captive
i
will
go
she
cried
through
her
tears
he
forces
me
to
it
i
will
go
where
no
one
certainly
will
come
after
what
i
said
you
would
kill
yourself
madame
you
must
have
some
very
powerful
reasons
for
not
wishing
to
return
to
comte
certainly
i
have
well
then
tell
them
to
me
tell
them
to
my
uncle
in
us
you
will
find
two
devoted
advisers
though
in
the
confessional
my
uncle
is
a
priest
he
never
is
one
in
a
we
will
hear
you
we
will
try
to
find
a
solution
of
the
problems
you
may
lay
before
us
and
if
you
are
the
dupe
or
the
victim
of
some
misapprehension
perhaps
we
can
clear
the
matter
up
your
soul
i
believe
is
pure
but
if
you
have
done
wrong
your
fault
is
fully
expiated
at
any
rate
remember
that
in
me
you
have
a
most
sincere
friend
if
you
should
wish
to
evade
the
count
s
tyranny
i
will
find
you
the
means
he
shall
never
find
oh
there
is
always
a
convent
said
she
yes
but
the
count
as
minister
of
state
can
procure
your
rejection
by
every
convent
in
the
world
even
though
he
is
powerful
i
will
save
you
from
him
but
only
when
you
have
demonstrated
to
me
that
you
can
not
and
ought
not
to
return
to
him
oh
do
not
fear
that
you
would
escape
his
power
only
to
fall
into
mine
i
added
noticing
a
glance
of
horrible
suspicion
full
of
exaggerated
dignity
you
shall
have
peace
solitude
and
independence
in
short
you
shall
be
as
free
and
as
little
annoyed
as
if
you
were
an
ugly
cross
old
maid
i
myself
would
never
be
able
to
see
you
without
your
and
how
by
what
means
that
is
my
secret
i
am
not
deceiving
you
of
that
you
may
be
sure
prove
to
me
that
this
is
the
only
life
you
can
lead
that
it
is
preferable
to
that
of
the
comtesse
octave
rich
admired
in
one
of
the
finest
houses
in
paris
beloved
by
her
husband
a
happy
mother
and
i
will
decide
in
your
but
said
she
will
there
never
be
a
man
who
understands
me
no
and
that
is
why
i
appeal
to
religion
to
decide
between
us
the
cure
of
the
white
friars
is
a
saint
years
of
age
my
uncle
is
not
a
grand
inquisitor
he
is
saint
john
but
for
you
he
will
be
fenelon
the
fenelon
who
said
to
the
duc
de
bourgogne
eat
a
calf
on
a
friday
by
all
means
monseigneur
but
be
a
nay
nay
monsieur
the
convent
is
my
last
hope
and
my
only
refuge
there
is
none
but
god
who
can
understand
me
no
man
not
saint
augustine
himself
the
tenderest
of
the
fathers
of
the
church
could
enter
into
the
scruples
of
my
conscience
which
are
to
me
as
the
circles
of
dante
s
hell
whence
there
is
no
escape
another
than
my
husband
a
different
man
however
unworthy
of
the
offering
has
had
all
my
love
no
he
has
not
had
it
for
he
did
not
take
it
i
gave
it
him
as
a
mother
gives
her
child
a
wonderful
toy
which
it
breaks
for
me
there
never
could
be
two
loves
in
some
natures
love
can
never
be
on
trial
it
is
or
it
is
not
when
it
comes
when
it
rises
up
it
is
well
that
life
of
eighteen
months
was
to
me
a
life
of
eighteen
years
i
threw
into
it
all
the
faculties
of
my
being
which
were
not
impoverished
by
their
effusiveness
they
were
exhausted
by
that
delusive
intimacy
in
which
i
alone
was
genuine
for
me
the
cup
of
happiness
is
not
drained
nor
empty
and
nothing
can
refill
it
for
it
is
broken
i
am
out
of
the
fray
i
have
no
weapons
left
having
thus
utterly
abandoned
myself
what
am
i
the
leavings
of
a
feast
i
had
but
one
name
bestowed
on
me
honorine
as
i
had
but
one
heart
my
husband
had
the
young
girl
a
worthless
lover
had
the
woman
there
is
nothing
left
then
let
myself
be
loved
that
is
the
great
idea
you
mean
to
utter
to
me
oh
but
i
still
am
something
and
i
rebel
at
the
idea
of
being
a
prostitute
yes
by
the
light
of
the
conflagration
i
saw
clearly
and
i
tell
you
well
i
could
imagine
surrendering
to
another
man
s
love
but
to
octave
s
no
ah
you
love
him
i
said
i
esteem
him
respect
him
venerate
him
he
never
has
done
me
the
smallest
hurt
he
is
kind
he
is
tender
but
i
can
never
more
love
him
however
she
went
on
let
us
talk
no
more
of
this
discussion
makes
everything
small
i
will
express
my
notions
on
this
subject
in
writing
to
you
for
at
this
moment
they
are
suffocating
me
i
am
feverish
my
feet
are
standing
in
the
ashes
of
my
paraclete
all
that
i
see
these
things
which
i
believed
i
had
earned
by
my
labor
now
remind
me
of
everything
i
wish
to
forget
ah
i
must
fly
from
hence
as
i
fled
from
my
where
will
you
go
i
asked
can
a
woman
exist
unprotected
at
thirty
in
all
the
glory
of
your
beauty
rich
in
powers
of
which
you
have
no
suspicion
full
of
tenderness
to
be
bestowed
are
you
prepared
to
live
in
the
wilderness
where
i
could
hide
you
be
quite
easy
the
count
who
for
nine
years
has
never
allowed
himself
to
be
seen
here
will
never
go
there
without
your
permission
you
have
his
sublime
devotion
of
nine
years
as
a
guarantee
for
your
tranquillity
you
may
therefore
discuss
the
future
in
perfect
confidence
with
my
uncle
and
me
my
uncle
has
as
much
influence
as
a
minister
of
state
so
compose
yourself
do
not
exaggerate
your
misfortune
a
priest
whose
hair
has
grown
white
in
the
exercise
of
his
functions
is
not
a
boy
you
will
be
understood
by
him
to
whom
every
passion
has
been
confided
for
nearly
fifty
years
now
and
who
weighs
in
his
hands
the
ponderous
heart
of
kings
and
princes
if
he
is
stern
under
his
stole
in
the
presence
of
your
flowers
he
will
be
as
tender
as
they
are
and
as
indulgent
as
his
divine
i
left
the
countess
at
midnight
she
was
apparently
calm
but
depressed
and
had
some
secret
purpose
which
no
perspicacity
could
guess
i
found
the
count
a
few
paces
off
in
the
rue
drawn
by
an
irresistible
attraction
he
had
quitted
the
spot
on
the
boulevards
where
we
had
agreed
to
meet
what
a
night
my
poor
child
will
go
through
he
exclaimed
when
i
had
finished
my
account
of
the
scene
that
had
just
taken
place
supposing
i
were
to
go
to
her
he
added
supposing
she
were
to
see
me
suddenly
at
this
moment
she
is
capable
of
throwing
herself
out
of
the
window
i
replied
the
countess
is
one
of
those
lucretias
who
could
not
survive
any
violence
even
if
it
were
done
by
a
man
into
whose
arms
she
could
throw
you
are
young
he
answered
you
do
not
know
that
in
a
soul
tossed
by
such
dreadful
alternatives
the
will
is
like
waters
of
a
lake
lashed
by
a
tempest
the
wind
changes
every
instant
and
the
waves
are
driven
now
to
one
shore
now
to
the
other
during
this
night
the
chances
are
quite
as
great
that
on
seeing
me
honorine
might
rush
into
my
arms
as
that
she
would
throw
herself
out
of
the
and
you
would
accept
the
equal
chances
said
i
well
come
said
he
i
have
at
home
to
enable
me
to
wait
till
a
dose
of
opium
which
desplein
prepared
for
me
to
send
me
to
sleep
without
any
risk
next
day
at
noon
gobain
brought
me
a
letter
telling
me
that
the
countess
had
gone
to
bed
at
six
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
that
having
taken
a
soothing
draught
prepared
by
the
chemist
she
had
now
fallen
asleep
this
is
her
letter
of
which
i
kept
a
copy
for
you
mademoiselle
said
the
consul
addressing
camille
know
all
the
resources
of
art
the
tricks
of
style
and
the
efforts
made
in
their
compositions
by
writers
who
do
not
lack
skill
but
you
will
acknowledge
that
literature
could
never
find
such
language
in
its
assumed
pathos
there
is
nothing
so
terrible
as
truth
here
is
the
letter
written
by
this
woman
or
rather
by
this
anguish
monsieur
maurice
i
know
all
your
uncle
would
say
to
me
he
is
not
better
informed
than
my
own
conscience
conscience
is
the
interpreter
of
god
to
man
i
know
that
if
i
am
not
reconciled
to
octave
i
shall
be
damned
that
is
the
sentence
of
religious
law
civil
law
condemns
me
to
obey
cost
what
it
may
if
my
husband
does
not
reject
me
the
world
will
regard
me
as
pure
as
virtuous
whatever
i
may
have
done
yes
that
much
is
sublime
in
marriage
society
ratifies
the
husband
s
forgiveness
but
it
forgets
that
the
forgiveness
must
be
accepted
legally
religiously
and
from
the
world
s
point
of
view
i
ought
to
go
back
to
octave
keeping
only
to
the
human
aspect
of
the
question
is
it
not
cruel
to
refuse
him
happiness
to
deprive
him
of
children
to
wipe
his
name
out
of
the
golden
book
and
the
list
of
peers
my
sufferings
my
repugnance
my
feelings
all
my
egoism
for
i
know
that
i
am
an
egoist
ought
to
be
sacrificed
to
the
family
i
shall
be
a
mother
the
caresses
of
my
child
will
wipe
away
many
tears
i
shall
be
very
happy
i
certainly
shall
be
much
looked
up
to
i
shall
ride
haughty
and
wealthy
in
a
handsome
carriage
i
shall
have
servants
and
a
fine
house
and
be
the
queen
of
as
many
parties
as
there
are
weeks
in
the
year
the
world
will
receive
me
handsomely
i
shall
not
have
to
climb
up
again
to
the
heaven
of
aristocracy
i
shall
never
have
come
down
from
it
so
god
the
law
society
are
all
in
accord
what
are
you
rebelling
against
i
am
asked
from
the
height
of
heaven
from
the
pulpit
from
the
judge
s
bench
and
from
the
throne
whose
august
intervention
may
at
need
be
invoked
by
the
count
your
uncle
indeed
at
need
would
speak
to
me
of
a
certain
celestial
grace
which
will
flood
my
heart
when
i
know
the
pleasure
of
doing
my
duty
god
the
law
the
world
and
octave
all
wish
me
to
live
no
doubt
well
if
there
is
no
other
difficulty
my
reply
cuts
the
knot
i
will
not
live
i
will
become
white
and
innocent
again
for
i
will
lie
in
my
shroud
white
with
the
blameless
pallor
of
death
this
is
not
in
the
least
mulish
that
mulish
obstinacy
of
which
you
jestingly
accused
me
is
in
a
woman
the
result
of
confidence
of
a
vision
of
the
future
though
my
husband
sublimely
generous
may
forget
all
i
shall
not
forget
does
forgetfulness
depend
on
our
will
when
a
widow
love
makes
a
girl
of
her
she
marries
a
man
she
loves
but
i
can
not
love
the
count
it
all
lies
in
that
do
not
you
see
every
time
my
eyes
met
his
i
should
see
my
sin
in
them
even
when
his
were
full
of
love
the
greatness
of
his
generosity
would
be
the
measure
of
the
greatness
of
my
crime
my
eyes
always
uneasy
would
be
for
ever
reading
an
invisible
condemnation
my
heart
would
be
full
of
confused
and
struggling
memories
marriage
can
never
move
me
to
the
cruel
rapture
the
mortal
delirium
of
passion
i
should
kill
my
husband
by
my
coldness
by
comparisons
which
he
would
guess
though
hidden
in
the
depths
of
my
conscience
oh
on
the
day
when
i
should
read
a
trace
of
involuntary
even
of
suppressed
reproach
in
a
furrow
on
his
brow
in
a
saddened
look
in
some
imperceptible
gesture
nothing
could
hold
me
i
should
be
lying
with
a
fractured
skull
on
the
pavement
and
find
that
less
hard
than
my
husband
it
might
be
my
own
that
would
lead
me
to
this
horrible
but
welcome
death
i
might
die
the
victim
of
an
impatient
mood
in
octave
caused
by
some
matter
of
business
or
be
deceived
by
some
unjust
suspicion
alas
i
might
even
mistake
some
proof
of
love
for
a
sign
of
contempt
what
torture
on
both
sides
octave
would
be
always
doubting
me
i
doubting
him
i
quite
involuntarily
should
give
him
a
rival
wholly
unworthy
of
him
a
man
whom
i
despise
but
with
whom
i
have
known
raptures
branded
on
me
with
fire
which
are
my
shame
but
which
i
can
not
forget
have
i
shown
you
enough
of
my
heart
no
one
monsieur
can
convince
me
that
love
may
be
renewed
for
i
neither
can
nor
will
accept
love
from
any
one
a
young
bride
is
like
a
plucked
flower
but
a
guilty
wife
is
like
a
flower
that
had
been
walked
over
you
who
are
a
florist
you
know
whether
it
is
ever
possible
to
restore
the
broken
stem
to
revive
the
faded
colors
to
make
the
sap
flow
again
in
the
tender
vessels
of
which
the
whole
vegetative
function
lies
in
their
perfect
rigidity
if
some
botanist
should
attempt
the
operation
could
his
genius
smooth
out
the
folds
of
the
bruised
corolla
if
he
could
remake
a
flower
he
would
be
god
god
alone
can
remake
me
i
am
drinking
the
bitter
cup
of
expiation
but
as
i
drink
it
i
painfully
spell
out
this
sentence
expiation
is
not
annihilation
in
my
little
house
alone
i
eat
my
bread
soaked
in
tears
but
no
one
sees
me
eat
nor
sees
me
weep
if
i
go
back
to
octave
i
must
give
up
my
tears
they
would
offend
him
oh
monsieur
how
many
virtues
must
a
woman
tread
under
foot
not
to
give
herself
but
to
restore
herself
to
a
betrayed
husband
who
could
count
them
god
alone
for
he
alone
can
know
and
encourage
the
horrible
refinements
at
which
the
angels
must
turn
pale
nay
i
will
go
further
a
woman
has
courage
in
the
presence
of
her
husband
if
he
knows
nothing
she
shows
a
sort
of
fierce
strength
in
her
hypocrisy
she
deceives
him
to
secure
him
double
happiness
but
common
knowledge
is
surely
degrading
supposing
i
could
exchange
humiliation
for
ecstasy
would
not
octave
at
last
feel
that
my
consent
was
sheer
depravity
marriage
is
based
on
esteem
on
sacrifices
on
both
sides
but
neither
octave
nor
i
could
esteem
each
other
the
day
after
our
reunion
he
would
have
disgraced
me
by
a
love
like
that
of
an
old
man
for
a
courtesan
and
i
should
for
ever
feel
the
shame
of
being
a
chattel
instead
of
a
lady
i
should
represent
pleasure
and
not
virtue
in
his
house
these
are
the
bitter
fruits
of
such
a
sin
i
have
made
myself
a
bed
where
i
can
only
toss
on
burning
coals
a
sleepless
pillow
here
when
i
suffer
i
bless
my
sufferings
i
say
to
god
i
thank
thee
but
in
my
husband
s
house
i
should
be
full
of
terror
tasting
joys
to
which
i
have
no
right
all
this
monsieur
is
not
argument
it
is
the
feeling
of
a
soul
made
vast
and
hollow
by
seven
years
of
suffering
finally
must
i
make
a
horrible
confession
i
shall
always
feel
at
my
bosom
the
lips
of
a
child
conceived
in
rapture
and
joy
and
in
the
belief
in
happiness
of
a
child
i
nursed
for
seven
months
that
i
shall
bear
in
my
womb
all
the
days
of
my
life
if
other
children
should
draw
their
nourishment
from
me
they
would
drink
in
tears
mingling
with
the
milk
and
turning
it
sour
i
seem
a
light
thing
you
regard
me
as
a
child
ah
yes
i
have
a
child
s
memory
the
memory
which
returns
to
us
on
the
verge
of
the
tomb
so
you
see
there
is
not
a
situation
in
that
beautiful
life
to
which
the
world
and
my
husband
s
love
want
to
recall
me
which
is
not
a
false
position
which
does
not
cover
a
snare
or
reveal
a
precipice
down
which
i
must
fall
torn
by
pitiless
rocks
for
five
years
now
i
have
been
wandering
in
the
sandy
desert
of
the
future
without
finding
a
place
convenient
to
repent
in
because
my
soul
is
possessed
by
true
repentance
religion
has
its
answers
ready
to
all
this
and
i
know
them
by
heart
this
suffering
these
difficulties
are
my
punishment
she
says
and
god
will
give
me
strength
to
endure
them
this
monsieur
is
an
argument
to
certain
pious
souls
gifted
with
an
energy
which
i
have
not
i
have
made
my
choice
between
this
hell
where
god
does
not
forbid
my
blessing
him
and
the
hell
that
awaits
me
under
count
octave
s
roof
one
word
more
if
i
were
still
a
girl
with
the
experience
i
now
have
my
husband
is
the
man
i
should
choose
but
that
is
the
very
reason
of
my
refusal
i
could
not
bear
to
blush
before
that
man
what
i
should
be
always
on
my
knees
he
always
standing
upright
and
if
we
were
to
exchange
positions
i
should
scorn
him
i
will
not
be
better
treated
by
him
in
consequence
of
my
sin
the
angel
who
might
venture
under
such
circumstances
on
certain
liberties
which
are
permissible
when
both
are
equally
blameless
is
not
on
earth
he
dwells
in
heaven
octave
is
full
of
delicate
feeling
i
know
but
even
in
his
soul
which
however
generous
is
a
man
s
soul
after
all
there
is
no
guarantee
for
the
new
life
i
should
lead
with
him
come
then
and
tell
me
where
i
may
find
the
solitude
the
peace
the
silence
so
kindly
to
irreparable
woes
which
you
promised
after
making
this
copy
of
the
letter
to
preserve
it
complete
i
went
to
the
rue
payenne
anxiety
had
conquered
the
power
of
opium
octave
was
walking
up
and
down
his
garden
like
a
madman
answer
that
said
i
giving
him
his
wife
s
letter
try
to
reassure
the
modesty
of
experience
it
is
rather
more
difficult
than
conquering
the
modesty
of
ignorance
which
curiosity
helps
to
she
is
mine
cried
the
count
whose
face
expressed
joy
as
he
went
on
reading
the
letter
he
signed
to
me
with
his
hand
to
leave
him
to
himself
i
understood
that
extreme
happiness
and
extreme
pain
obey
the
same
laws
i
went
in
to
receive
madame
de
courteville
and
amelie
who
were
to
dine
with
the
count
that
day
however
handsome
mademoiselle
de
courteville
might
be
i
felt
on
seeing
her
once
more
that
love
has
three
aspects
and
that
the
women
who
can
inspire
us
with
perfect
love
are
very
rare
as
i
involuntarily
compared
amelie
with
honorine
i
found
the
erring
wife
more
attractive
than
the
pure
girl
to
honorine
s
heart
fidelity
had
not
been
a
duty
but
the
inevitable
while
amelie
would
serenely
pronounce
the
most
solemn
promises
without
knowing
their
purport
or
to
what
they
bound
her
the
crushed
the
dead
woman
so
to
speak
the
sinner
to
be
reinstated
seemed
to
me
sublime
she
incited
the
special
generosities
of
a
man
s
nature
she
demanded
all
the
treasures
of
the
heart
all
the
resources
of
strength
she
filled
his
life
and
gave
the
zest
of
a
conflict
to
happiness
whereas
amelie
chaste
and
confiding
would
settle
down
into
the
sphere
of
peaceful
motherhood
where
the
commonplace
must
be
its
poetry
and
where
my
mind
would
find
no
struggle
and
no
victory
of
the
plains
of
champagne
and
the
snowy
but
sublime
alps
what
young
man
would
choose
the
chalky
monotonous
level
no
such
comparisons
are
fatal
and
wrong
on
the
threshold
of
the
mairie
alas
only
the
experience
of
life
can
teach
us
that
marriage
excludes
passion
that
a
family
can
not
have
its
foundation
on
the
tempests
of
love
after
having
dreamed
of
impossible
love
with
its
infinite
caprices
after
having
tasted
the
tormenting
delights
of
the
ideal
i
saw
before
me
modest
reality
pity
me
for
what
could
be
expected
at
i
did
not
trust
myself
but
i
took
a
manful
resolution
i
went
back
to
the
count
to
announce
the
arrival
of
his
relations
and
i
saw
him
grown
young
again
in
the
reflected
light
of
hope
what
ails
you
maurice
said
he
struck
by
my
changed
expression
monsieur
le
comte
no
longer
octave
you
to
whom
i
shall
owe
my
life
my
happiness
my
dear
octave
if
you
should
succeed
in
bringing
the
countess
back
to
her
duty
i
have
studied
her
well
he
looked
at
me
as
othello
must
have
looked
at
iago
when
iago
first
contrived
to
insinuate
a
suspicion
into
the
moor
s
mind
she
must
never
see
me
again
she
must
never
know
that
maurice
was
your
secretary
never
mention
my
name
to
her
or
all
will
be
undone
you
have
got
me
an
appointment
as
maitre
des
requetes
well
get
me
instead
some
diplomatic
post
abroad
a
consulship
and
do
not
think
of
my
marrying
oh
do
not
be
uneasy
i
added
seeing
him
draw
himself
up
i
will
play
my
part
to
the
poor
boy
said
he
taking
my
hand
which
he
pressed
while
he
kept
back
the
tears
that
were
starting
to
his
eyes
you
gave
me
the
gloves
i
said
laughing
but
i
have
not
put
them
on
that
is
we
then
agreed
as
to
what
i
was
to
do
that
evening
at
honorine
s
house
whither
i
presently
returned
it
was
now
august
the
day
had
been
hot
and
stormy
but
the
storm
hung
overhead
the
sky
was
like
copper
the
scent
of
the
flowers
was
heavy
i
felt
as
if
i
were
in
an
oven
and
caught
myself
wishing
that
the
countess
might
have
set
out
for
the
indies
but
she
was
sitting
on
a
wooden
bench
shaped
like
a
sofa
under
an
arbor
in
a
loose
dress
of
white
muslin
fastened
with
blue
bows
her
hair
unadorned
in
waving
bands
over
her
cheeks
her
feet
on
a
small
wooden
stool
and
showing
a
little
way
beyond
her
skirt
she
did
not
rise
she
showed
me
with
her
hand
to
the
seat
by
her
side
saying
now
is
not
life
at
a
deadlock
for
me
life
as
you
have
made
it
i
replied
but
not
the
life
i
propose
to
make
for
you
for
if
you
choose
you
may
be
very
happy
how
said
she
her
whole
person
was
a
question
your
letter
is
in
the
count
s
honorine
started
like
a
frightened
doe
sprang
to
a
few
paces
off
walked
down
the
garden
turned
about
remained
standing
for
some
minutes
and
finally
went
in
to
sit
alone
in
the
where
i
joined
her
after
giving
her
time
to
get
accustomed
to
the
pain
of
this
poniard
thrust
you
a
friend
say
rather
a
traitor
a
spy
perhaps
sent
by
my
instinct
in
women
is
as
strong
as
the
perspicacity
of
great
men
you
wanted
an
answer
to
your
letter
did
you
not
and
there
was
but
one
man
in
the
world
who
could
write
it
you
must
read
the
reply
my
dear
countess
and
if
after
reading
it
you
still
find
that
your
life
is
a
deadlock
the
spy
will
prove
himself
a
friend
i
will
place
you
in
a
convent
whence
the
count
s
power
can
not
drag
you
but
before
going
there
let
us
consider
the
other
side
of
the
question
there
is
a
law
alike
divine
and
human
which
even
hatred
affects
to
obey
and
which
commands
us
not
to
condemn
the
accused
without
hearing
his
defence
till
now
you
have
passed
condemnation
as
children
do
with
your
ears
stopped
the
devotion
of
seven
years
has
its
claims
so
you
must
read
the
answer
your
husband
will
send
you
i
have
forwarded
to
him
through
my
uncle
a
copy
of
your
letter
and
my
uncle
asked
him
what
his
reply
would
be
if
his
wife
wrote
him
a
letter
in
such
terms
thus
you
are
not
compromised
he
will
himself
bring
the
count
s
answer
in
the
presence
of
that
saintly
man
and
in
mine
out
of
respect
for
your
own
dignity
you
must
read
it
or
you
will
be
no
better
than
a
wilful
passionate
child
you
must
make
this
sacrifice
to
the
world
to
the
law
and
to
as
she
saw
in
this
concession
no
attack
on
her
womanly
resolve
she
consented
all
the
labor
or
four
or
five
months
had
been
building
up
to
this
moment
but
do
not
the
pyramids
end
in
a
point
on
which
a
bird
may
perch
the
count
had
set
all
his
hopes
on
this
supreme
instant
and
he
had
reached
it
in
all
my
life
i
remember
nothing
more
formidable
than
my
uncle
s
entrance
into
that
little
pompadour
at
ten
that
evening
the
fine
head
with
its
silver
hair
thrown
into
relief
by
the
entirely
black
dress
and
the
divinely
calm
face
had
a
magical
effect
on
the
comtesse
honorine
she
had
the
feeling
of
cool
balm
on
her
wounds
and
beamed
in
the
reflection
of
that
virtue
which
gave
light
without
knowing
it
monsieur
the
cure
of
the
white
friars
said
old
gobain
are
you
come
uncle
with
a
message
of
happiness
and
peace
said
i
happiness
and
peace
are
always
to
be
found
in
obedience
to
the
precepts
of
the
church
replied
my
uncle
and
he
handed
the
countess
the
following
letter
my
dear
honorine
if
you
had
but
done
me
the
favor
of
trusting
me
if
you
had
read
the
letter
i
wrote
to
you
five
years
since
you
would
have
spared
yourself
five
years
of
useless
labor
and
of
privations
which
have
grieved
me
deeply
in
it
i
proposed
an
arrangement
of
which
the
stipulations
will
relieve
all
your
fears
and
make
our
domestic
life
possible
i
have
much
to
reproach
myself
with
and
in
seven
years
of
sorrow
i
have
discovered
all
my
errors
i
misunderstood
marriage
i
failed
to
scent
danger
when
it
threatened
you
an
angel
was
in
the
house
the
lord
bid
me
guard
it
well
the
lord
has
punished
me
for
my
audacious
confidence
you
can
not
give
yourself
a
single
lash
without
striking
me
have
mercy
on
me
my
dear
honorine
i
so
fully
appreciated
your
susceptibilities
that
i
would
not
bring
you
back
to
the
old
house
in
the
rue
payenne
where
i
can
live
without
you
but
which
i
could
not
bear
to
see
again
with
you
i
am
decorating
with
great
pleasure
another
house
in
the
faubourg
to
which
in
hope
i
conduct
not
a
wife
whom
i
owe
to
her
ignorance
of
life
and
secured
to
me
by
law
but
a
sister
who
will
allow
me
to
press
on
her
brow
such
a
kiss
as
a
father
gives
the
daughter
he
blesses
every
day
will
you
bereave
me
of
the
right
i
have
conquered
from
your
despair
that
of
watching
more
closely
over
your
needs
your
pleasures
your
life
even
women
have
one
heart
always
on
their
side
always
abounding
in
excuses
their
mother
s
you
never
knew
any
mother
but
my
mother
who
would
have
brought
you
back
to
me
but
how
is
it
that
you
never
guessed
that
i
had
for
you
the
heart
of
a
mother
both
of
my
mother
and
of
your
own
yes
dear
my
affection
is
neither
mean
nor
grasping
it
is
one
of
those
which
will
never
let
any
annoyance
last
long
enough
to
pucker
the
brow
of
the
child
it
worships
what
can
you
think
of
the
companion
of
your
childhood
honorine
if
you
believe
him
capable
of
accepting
kisses
given
in
trembling
of
living
between
delight
and
anxiety
do
not
fear
that
you
will
be
exposed
to
the
laments
of
a
suppliant
passion
i
would
not
want
you
back
until
i
felt
certain
of
my
own
strength
to
leave
you
in
perfect
freedom
your
solitary
pride
has
exaggerated
the
difficulties
you
may
if
you
will
look
on
at
the
life
of
a
brother
or
of
a
father
without
either
suffering
or
joy
but
you
will
find
neither
mockery
nor
indifference
nor
have
any
doubt
as
to
his
intentions
the
warmth
of
the
atmosphere
in
which
you
live
will
be
always
equable
and
genial
without
tempests
without
a
possible
squall
if
later
when
you
feel
secure
that
you
are
as
much
at
home
as
in
your
own
little
house
you
desire
to
try
some
other
elements
of
happiness
pleasures
or
amusements
you
can
expand
their
circle
at
your
will
the
tenderness
of
a
mother
knows
neither
contempt
nor
pity
what
is
it
love
without
desire
well
in
me
admiration
shall
hide
every
sentiment
in
which
you
might
see
an
offence
thus
living
side
by
side
we
may
both
be
magnanimous
in
you
the
kindness
of
a
sister
the
affectionate
thoughtfulness
of
a
friend
will
satisfy
the
ambition
of
him
who
wishes
to
be
your
life
s
companion
and
you
may
measure
his
tenderness
by
the
care
he
will
take
to
conceal
it
neither
you
nor
i
will
be
jealous
of
the
past
for
we
may
each
acknowledge
that
the
other
has
sense
enough
to
look
only
straight
forward
thus
you
will
be
at
home
in
your
new
house
exactly
as
you
are
in
the
rue
unapproachable
alone
occupied
as
you
please
living
by
your
own
law
but
having
in
addition
the
legitimate
protection
of
which
you
are
now
exacting
the
most
chivalrous
labors
of
love
with
the
consideration
which
lends
so
much
lustre
to
a
woman
and
the
fortune
which
will
allow
of
your
doing
many
good
works
honorine
when
you
long
for
an
unnecessary
absolution
you
have
only
to
ask
for
it
it
will
not
be
forced
upon
you
by
the
church
or
by
the
law
it
will
wait
on
your
pride
on
your
own
impulsion
my
wife
might
indeed
have
to
fear
all
the
things
you
dread
but
not
my
friend
and
sister
towards
whom
i
am
bound
to
show
every
form
and
refinement
of
politeness
to
see
you
happy
is
enough
happiness
for
me
i
have
proved
this
for
the
seven
years
past
the
guarantee
for
this
honorine
is
to
be
seen
in
all
the
flowers
made
by
you
carefully
preserved
and
watered
by
my
tears
like
the
the
tally
cords
of
the
peruvians
they
are
the
record
of
our
sorrows
if
this
secret
compact
does
not
suit
you
my
child
i
have
begged
the
saintly
man
who
takes
charge
of
this
letter
not
to
say
a
word
in
my
behalf
i
will
not
owe
your
return
to
the
terrors
threatened
by
the
church
nor
to
the
bidding
of
the
law
i
will
not
accept
the
simple
and
quiet
happiness
that
i
ask
from
any
one
but
yourself
if
you
persist
in
condemning
me
to
the
lonely
life
bereft
even
of
a
fraternal
smile
which
i
have
led
for
nine
years
if
you
remain
in
your
solitude
and
show
no
sign
my
will
yields
to
yours
understand
me
perfectly
you
shall
be
no
more
troubled
than
you
have
been
until
this
day
i
will
get
rid
of
the
crazy
fellow
who
has
meddled
in
your
concerns
and
has
perhaps
caused
you
some
annoyance
monsieur
said
honorine
folding
up
the
letter
which
she
placed
in
her
bosom
and
looking
at
my
uncle
thank
you
very
much
i
will
avail
myself
of
monsieur
le
comte
s
permission
to
remain
here
ah
i
exclaimed
this
exclamation
made
my
uncle
look
at
me
uneasily
and
won
from
the
countess
a
mischievous
glance
which
enlightened
me
as
to
her
motives
honorine
had
wanted
to
ascertain
whether
i
were
an
actor
a
bird
snarer
and
i
had
the
melancholy
satisfaction
of
deceiving
her
by
my
exclamation
which
was
one
of
those
cries
from
the
heart
which
women
understand
so
well
ah
maurice
said
she
you
know
how
to
the
light
that
flashed
in
my
eyes
was
another
reply
which
would
have
dissipated
the
countess
uneasiness
if
she
still
had
any
thus
the
count
found
me
useful
to
the
very
last
honorine
then
took
out
the
count
s
letter
again
to
finish
reading
it
my
uncle
signed
to
me
and
i
rose
let
us
leave
the
countess
said
he
you
are
going
already
maurice
she
said
without
looking
at
me
she
rose
and
still
reading
followed
us
to
the
door
on
the
threshold
she
took
my
hand
pressed
it
very
affectionately
and
said
we
shall
meet
again
no
i
replied
wringing
her
hand
so
that
she
cried
out
you
love
your
husband
i
leave
and
i
rushed
away
leaving
my
uncle
to
whom
she
said
why
what
is
the
matter
with
your
nephew
the
good
abbe
completed
my
work
by
pointing
to
his
head
and
heart
as
much
as
to
say
he
is
mad
madame
you
must
forgive
him
and
with
all
the
more
truth
because
he
really
thought
it
six
days
after
i
set
out
with
an
appointment
as
in
spain
in
a
large
commercial
town
where
i
could
quickly
qualify
to
rise
in
the
career
of
a
consul
to
which
i
now
restricted
my
ambition
after
i
had
established
myself
there
i
received
this
letter
from
the
count
my
dear
maurice
if
i
were
happy
i
should
not
write
to
you
but
i
have
entered
on
a
new
life
of
suffering
i
have
grown
young
again
in
my
desires
with
all
the
impatience
of
a
man
of
forty
and
the
prudence
of
a
diplomatist
who
has
learned
to
moderate
his
passion
when
you
left
i
had
not
yet
been
admitted
to
the
in
the
rue
but
a
letter
had
promised
me
that
i
should
have
permission
the
mild
and
melancholy
letter
of
a
woman
who
dreaded
the
agitations
of
a
meeting
after
waiting
for
more
than
a
month
i
made
bold
to
call
and
desired
gobain
to
inquire
whether
i
could
be
received
i
sat
down
in
a
chair
in
the
avenue
near
the
lodge
my
head
buried
in
my
hands
and
there
i
remained
for
almost
an
hour
madame
had
to
dress
said
gobain
to
hide
honorine
s
hesitancy
under
a
pride
of
appearance
which
was
flattering
to
me
during
a
long
quarter
of
an
hour
we
both
of
us
were
possessed
by
an
involuntary
nervous
trembling
as
great
as
that
which
seizes
a
speaker
on
the
platform
and
we
spoke
to
each
other
sacred
phrases
like
those
of
persons
taken
by
surprise
who
make
believe
a
conversation
you
see
honorine
said
i
my
eyes
full
of
tears
the
ice
is
broken
and
i
am
so
tremulous
with
happiness
that
you
must
forgive
the
incoherency
of
my
language
it
will
be
so
for
a
long
time
there
is
no
crime
in
being
in
love
with
your
wife
said
she
with
a
forced
smile
do
me
the
favor
said
i
no
longer
to
work
as
you
do
i
have
heard
from
madame
gobain
that
for
three
weeks
you
have
been
living
on
your
savings
you
have
sixty
thousand
francs
a
year
of
your
own
and
if
you
can
not
give
me
back
your
heart
at
least
do
not
abandon
your
fortune
to
i
have
long
known
your
kindness
said
she
though
you
should
prefer
to
remain
here
said
i
and
to
preserve
your
independence
though
the
most
ardent
love
should
find
no
favor
in
your
eyes
still
do
not
i
gave
her
three
certificates
for
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
each
she
took
them
opened
them
languidly
and
after
reading
them
through
she
gave
me
only
a
look
as
my
reward
she
fully
understood
that
i
was
not
offering
her
money
but
freedom
i
am
conquered
said
she
holding
out
her
hand
which
i
kissed
come
and
see
me
as
often
as
you
so
she
had
done
herself
a
violence
in
receiving
me
next
day
i
found
her
armed
with
affected
high
spirits
and
it
took
two
months
of
habit
before
i
saw
her
in
her
true
character
but
then
it
was
like
a
delicious
may
a
springtime
of
love
that
gave
me
ineffable
bliss
she
was
no
longer
afraid
she
was
studying
me
alas
when
i
proposed
that
she
should
go
to
england
to
return
ostensibly
to
me
to
our
home
that
she
should
resume
her
rank
and
live
in
our
new
residence
she
was
seized
with
alarm
why
not
live
always
as
we
are
she
said
i
submitted
without
saying
a
word
is
she
making
an
experiment
i
asked
myself
as
i
left
her
on
my
way
from
my
own
house
to
the
rue
thoughts
of
love
had
swelled
in
my
heart
and
i
had
said
to
myself
like
a
young
man
this
evening
she
will
all
my
real
or
affected
force
was
blown
to
the
winds
by
a
smile
by
a
command
from
those
proud
calm
eyes
untouched
by
passion
i
remembered
the
terrible
words
you
once
quoted
to
me
lucretia
s
dagger
wrote
in
letters
of
blood
the
watchword
of
woman
s
charter
liberty
and
they
froze
me
i
felt
imperatively
how
necessary
to
me
was
honorine
s
consent
and
how
impossible
it
was
to
wring
it
from
her
could
she
guess
the
storms
that
distracted
me
when
i
left
as
when
i
came
at
last
i
painted
my
situation
in
a
letter
to
her
giving
up
the
attempt
to
speak
of
it
honorine
made
no
answer
and
she
was
so
sad
that
i
made
as
though
i
had
not
written
i
was
deeply
grieved
by
the
idea
that
i
could
have
distressed
her
she
read
my
heart
and
forgave
me
and
this
was
how
three
days
ago
she
received
me
for
the
first
time
in
her
own
room
it
was
bright
with
flowers
dressed
and
lighted
up
honorine
was
in
a
dress
that
made
her
bewitching
her
hair
framed
that
face
that
you
know
in
its
light
curls
and
in
it
were
some
sprays
of
cape
heath
she
wore
a
white
muslin
gown
a
white
sash
with
long
floating
ends
you
know
what
she
is
in
such
simplicity
but
that
day
she
was
a
bride
the
honorine
of
long
past
days
my
joy
was
chilled
at
once
for
her
face
was
terribly
grave
there
were
fires
beneath
the
ice
octave
she
said
i
will
return
as
your
wife
when
you
will
but
understand
clearly
that
this
submission
has
its
dangers
i
can
be
resigned
i
made
a
movement
yes
she
went
on
i
understand
resignation
offends
you
and
you
want
what
i
can
not
give
love
religion
and
pity
led
me
to
renounce
my
vow
of
solitude
you
are
here
she
paused
at
first
she
went
on
you
asked
no
more
now
you
demand
your
wife
well
here
i
give
you
honorine
such
as
she
is
without
deceiving
you
as
to
what
she
will
what
shall
i
be
a
mother
i
hope
it
believe
me
i
hope
it
eagerly
try
to
change
me
you
have
my
consent
but
if
i
should
die
my
dear
do
not
curse
my
memory
and
do
not
set
down
to
obstinacy
what
i
should
call
the
worship
of
the
ideal
if
it
were
not
more
natural
to
call
the
indefinable
feeling
which
must
kill
me
the
worship
of
the
divine
the
future
will
be
nothing
to
me
it
will
be
your
concern
consult
your
own
and
she
sat
down
in
the
calm
attitude
you
used
to
admire
and
watched
me
turning
pale
with
the
pain
she
had
inflicted
my
blood
ran
cold
on
seeing
the
effect
of
her
words
she
took
both
my
hands
and
holding
them
in
her
own
she
said
octave
i
do
love
you
but
not
in
the
way
you
wish
to
be
loved
i
love
your
soul
still
understand
that
i
love
you
enough
to
die
in
your
service
like
an
eastern
slave
and
without
a
regret
it
will
be
my
she
did
more
she
knelt
before
me
on
a
cushion
and
in
a
spirit
of
sublime
charity
she
said
and
perhaps
i
shall
not
die
for
two
months
now
i
have
been
struggling
with
myself
what
shall
i
do
my
heart
is
too
full
i
therefore
seek
a
friend
and
send
out
this
cry
what
shall
i
do
i
did
not
answer
this
letter
two
months
later
the
newspapers
announced
the
return
on
board
an
english
vessel
of
the
comtesse
octave
restored
to
her
family
after
adventures
by
land
and
sea
invented
with
sufficient
probability
to
arouse
no
contradiction
when
i
moved
to
genoa
i
received
a
formal
announcement
of
the
happy
event
of
the
birth
of
a
son
to
the
count
and
countess
i
held
that
letter
in
my
hand
for
two
hours
sitting
on
this
terrace
on
this
bench
two
months
after
urged
by
octave
by
de
grandville
and
monsieur
de
serizy
my
kind
friends
and
broken
by
the
death
of
my
uncle
i
agreed
to
take
a
wife
six
months
after
the
revolution
of
july
i
received
this
letter
which
concludes
the
story
of
this
couple
monsieur
maurice
i
am
dying
though
i
am
a
mother
perhaps
because
i
am
a
mother
i
have
played
my
part
as
a
wife
well
i
have
deceived
my
husband
i
have
had
happiness
not
less
genuine
than
the
tears
shed
by
actresses
on
the
stage
i
am
dying
for
society
for
the
family
for
marriage
as
the
early
christians
died
for
god
i
know
not
of
what
i
am
dying
and
i
am
honestly
trying
to
find
out
for
i
am
not
perverse
but
i
am
bent
on
explaining
my
malady
to
you
you
who
brought
that
heavenly
physician
your
uncle
at
whose
word
i
surrendered
he
was
my
director
i
nursed
him
in
his
last
illness
and
he
showed
me
the
way
to
heaven
bidding
me
persevere
in
my
duty
and
i
have
done
my
duty
i
do
not
blame
those
who
forget
i
admire
them
as
strong
and
necessary
natures
but
i
have
the
malady
of
memory
i
have
not
been
able
twice
to
feel
that
love
of
the
heart
which
identifies
a
woman
with
the
man
she
loves
to
the
last
moment
as
you
know
i
cried
to
your
heart
in
the
confessional
and
to
my
husband
have
mercy
but
there
was
no
mercy
well
and
i
am
dying
dying
with
stupendous
courage
no
courtesan
was
ever
more
gay
than
i
my
poor
octave
is
happy
i
let
his
love
feed
on
the
illusions
of
my
heart
i
throw
all
my
powers
into
this
terrible
masquerade
the
actress
is
applauded
feasted
smothered
in
flowers
but
the
invisible
rival
comes
every
day
to
seek
its
prey
a
fragment
of
my
life
i
am
rent
and
i
smile
i
smile
on
two
children
but
it
is
the
elder
the
dead
one
that
will
triumph
i
told
you
so
before
the
dead
child
calls
me
and
i
am
going
to
him
the
intimacy
of
marriage
without
love
is
a
position
in
which
my
soul
feels
degraded
every
hour
i
can
never
weep
or
give
myself
up
to
dreams
but
when
i
am
alone
the
exigencies
of
society
the
care
of
my
child
and
that
of
octave
s
happiness
never
leave
me
a
moment
to
refresh
myself
to
renew
my
strength
as
i
could
in
my
solitude
the
incessant
need
for
watchfulness
startles
my
heart
with
constant
alarms
i
have
not
succeeded
in
implanting
in
my
soul
the
vigilance
that
lies
with
facility
and
has
the
eyes
of
a
lynx
it
is
not
the
lip
of
one
i
love
that
drinks
my
tears
and
kisses
them
my
burning
eyes
are
cooled
with
water
and
not
with
tender
lips
it
is
my
soul
that
acts
a
part
and
that
perhaps
is
why
i
am
dying
i
lock
up
my
griefs
with
so
much
care
that
nothing
is
to
be
seen
of
it
it
must
eat
into
something
and
it
has
attacked
my
life
i
said
to
the
doctors
who
discovered
my
secret
make
me
die
of
some
plausible
complaint
or
i
shall
drag
my
husband
with
so
it
is
quite
understood
by
desplein
bianchon
and
myself
that
i
am
dying
of
the
softening
of
some
bone
which
science
has
fully
described
octave
believes
that
i
adore
him
do
you
understand
so
i
am
afraid
lest
he
should
follow
me
i
now
write
to
beg
you
in
that
case
to
be
the
little
count
s
guardian
you
will
find
with
this
a
codicil
in
which
i
have
expressed
my
wish
but
do
not
produce
it
excepting
in
case
of
need
for
perhaps
i
am
fatuously
vain
my
devotion
may
perhaps
leave
octave
inconsolable
but
willing
to
poor
octave
i
wish
him
a
better
wife
than
i
am
for
he
deserves
to
be
well
loved
since
my
spiritual
spy
is
married
i
bid
him
remember
what
the
florist
of
the
rue
hereby
bequeaths
to
him
as
a
lesson
may
your
wife
soon
be
a
mother
fling
her
into
the
vulgarest
materialism
of
household
life
hinder
her
from
cherishing
in
her
heart
the
mysterious
flower
of
the
ideal
of
that
heavenly
perfection
in
which
i
believed
that
enchanted
blossom
with
glorious
colors
and
whose
perfume
disgusts
us
with
reality
i
am
a
who
has
not
been
suffered
to
live
on
ecstasy
in
the
depths
of
a
convent
with
the
holy
infant
and
a
spotless
winged
angel
to
come
and
go
as
she
wished
you
saw
me
happy
among
my
beloved
flowers
i
did
not
tell
you
all
i
saw
love
budding
under
your
affected
madness
and
i
concealed
from
you
my
thoughts
my
poetry
i
did
not
admit
you
to
my
kingdom
of
beauty
well
well
you
will
love
my
child
for
love
of
me
if
he
should
one
day
lose
his
poor
father
keep
my
secrets
as
the
grave
will
keep
them
do
not
mourn
for
me
i
have
been
dead
this
many
a
day
if
saint
bernard
was
right
in
saying
that
where
there
is
no
more
love
there
is
no
more
and
the
countess
died
said
the
consul
putting
away
the
letters
and
locking
the
is
the
count
still
living
asked
the
ambassador
for
since
the
revolution
of
july
he
has
disappeared
from
the
political
do
you
remember
monsieur
de
lora
said
the
having
seen
me
going
to
the
steamboat
with
a
man
an
old
man
said
the
painter
an
old
man
of
going
in
search
of
health
and
amusement
in
southern
italy
that
old
man
was
my
poor
friend
my
patron
passing
through
genoa
to
take
leave
of
me
and
place
his
will
in
my
hands
he
appoints
me
his
son
s
guardian
i
had
no
occasion
to
tell
him
of
honorine
s
does
he
suspect
himself
of
murder
said
mademoiselle
des
touches
to
the
baron
de
l
hostal
he
suspects
the
truth
replied
the
consul
and
that
is
what
is
killing
him
i
remained
on
board
the
steam
packet
that
was
to
take
him
to
naples
till
it
was
out
of
the
roadstead
a
small
boat
brought
me
back
we
sat
for
some
little
time
taking
leave
of
each
other
for
ever
i
fear
god
only
knows
how
much
we
love
the
confidant
of
our
love
when
she
who
inspired
it
is
no
more
that
man
said
octave
holds
a
charm
and
wears
an
the
count
went
to
the
prow
and
looked
down
on
the
mediterranean
it
happened
to
be
fine
and
moved
no
doubt
by
the
spectacle
he
spoke
these
last
words
ought
we
not
in
the
interests
of
human
nature
to
inquire
what
is
the
irresistible
power
which
leads
us
to
sacrifice
an
exquisite
creature
to
the
most
fugitive
of
all
pleasures
and
in
spite
of
our
reason
in
my
conscience
i
heard
cries
honorine
was
not
alone
in
her
anguish
and
yet
i
would
have
it
i
am
consumed
by
remorse
in
the
rue
payenne
i
was
dying
of
the
joys
i
had
not
now
i
shall
die
in
italy
of
the
joys
i
have
had
wherein
lay
the
discord
between
two
natures
equally
noble
i
dare
assert
for
some
minutes
profound
silence
reigned
on
the
terrace
then
the
consul
turning
to
the
two
women
asked
was
she
virtuous
mademoiselle
des
touches
rose
took
the
consul
s
arm
went
a
few
steps
away
and
said
to
him
are
not
men
wrong
too
when
they
come
to
us
and
make
a
young
girl
a
wife
while
cherishing
at
the
bottom
of
their
heart
some
angelic
image
and
comparing
us
to
those
unknown
rivals
to
perfections
often
borrowed
from
a
remembrance
and
always
finding
us
wanting
mademoiselle
you
would
be
right
if
marriage
were
based
on
passion
and
that
was
the
mistake
of
those
two
who
will
soon
be
no
more
marriage
with
love
on
both
sides
would
be
mademoiselle
des
touches
turned
from
the
consul
and
was
immediately
joined
by
claude
vignon
who
said
in
her
ear
a
bit
of
a
coxcomb
is
de
l
no
replied
she
whispering
to
claude
these
words
for
he
has
not
yet
guessed
that
honorine
would
have
loved
oh
she
exclaimed
seeing
the
consul
s
wife
approaching
his
wife
was
listening
unhappy
man
eleven
was
striking
by
all
the
clocks
and
the
guests
went
home
on
foot
along
the
seashore
still
that
is
not
life
said
mademoiselle
des
touches
that
woman
was
one
of
the
rarest
and
perhaps
the
most
extraordinary
exceptions
in
intellect
a
pearl
life
is
made
up
of
various
incidents
of
pain
and
pleasure
alternately
the
paradise
of
dante
that
sublime
expression
of
the
ideal
that
perpetual
blue
is
to
be
found
only
in
the
soul
to
ask
it
of
the
facts
of
life
is
a
luxury
against
which
nature
protests
every
hour
to
such
souls
as
those
the
six
feet
of
a
cell
and
the
kneeling
chair
are
all
they
you
are
right
said
leon
de
lora
but
as
i
may
be
i
can
not
help
admiring
a
woman
who
is
capable
as
that
one
was
of
living
by
the
side
of
a
studio
under
a
painter
s
roof
and
never
coming
down
nor
seeing
the
world
nor
dipping
her
feet
in
the
street
such
a
thing
has
been
known
for
a
few
months
said
claude
vignon
with
deep
irony
comtesse
honorine
is
not
unique
of
her
kind
replied
the
ambassador
to
mademoiselle
des
touches
a
man
nay
and
a
politician
a
bitter
writer
was
the
object
of
such
a
passion
and
the
pistol
shot
which
killed
him
hit
not
him
alone
the
woman
who
loved
lived
like
a
nun
ever
then
there
are
yet
some
great
souls
in
this
age
said
camille
maupin
and
she
stood
for
some
minutes
pensively
leaning
