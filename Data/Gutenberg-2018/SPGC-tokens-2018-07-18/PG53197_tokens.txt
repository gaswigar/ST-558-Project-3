always

it
must
be
fun
to
be
an
stasia
s
speech
was
somewhat
impeded
by
the
mouthful
of
pins
she
was
trying
not
to
swallow
fun
cynthia
frowned
thinking
yes
i
suppose
it
is
i
wouldn
t
know
how
to
be
anything
else
ouch
that
was
me
you
were
she
braced
herself
with
one
arm
against
the
bulkhead
as
the
ship
tipped
at
a
slight
angle
make
that
sleeve
as
short
as
you
stasia
took
the
last
pin
out
of
her
mouth
slip
off
your
blouse
now
and
i
ll
baste
it
up
for
you
you
ll
make
a
sweet
pirate
if
pirates
ever
were
cynthia
free
of
the
blouse
turned
to
experiment
before
the
long
mirror
in
the
door
hesitating
between
the
respective
merits
of
a
red
bandana
handkerchief
over
her
black
curls
and
the
more
sinister
effect
of
a
black
scarf
which
could
be
continued
down
into
a
black
mask
with
eyeholes
stasia
bit
off
her
thread
there
that
s
ready
when
will
you
break
it
to
miss
mitchall
that
she
s
got
to
wear
a
costume
tonight
cynthia
giggled
you
ought
to
come
along
and
help
me
but
i
guess
i
ll
wait
till
the
last
minute
and
rush
her
into
the
she
glanced
toward
the
bed
where
a
tall
witch
s
cap
made
of
green
cardboard
from
the
ship
s
barber
shop
reposed
beside
a
cape
of
green
broadcloth
borrowed
from
stasia
and
a
pair
of
miss
mitchall
s
own
shoes
now
adorned
with
huge
buckles
of
cardboard
and
silver
foil
i
ll
need
some
help
with
my
wig
said
stasia
and
then
i
think
we
re
all
the
wig
was
of
bright
orange
yarn
loosely
knitted
into
a
tight
fitting
cap
of
coarse
net
which
completely
covered
stasia
s
sleek
bob
it
needs
tightening
at
the
back
wait
a
cynthia
braced
her
feet
dash
this
boat
i
hope
she
stops
rolling
before
dinner
or
we
shan
t
have
any
dance
do
they
always
have
a
costume
party
every
trip
always
the
second
day
before
we
get
into
cherbourg
paris
day
after
tomorrow
aren
t
you
thrilled
cynthia
pinning
the
wig
into
a
better
fit
murmured
a
vague
assent
but
she
didn
t
feel
at
all
thrilled
after
eight
days
the
ship
was
like
another
home
in
which
she
knew
by
sight
at
least
almost
every
occupant
paris
was
going
to
be
new
and
strange
oh
yes
a
grand
new
adventure
but
sometimes
she
got
scared
at
the
thought
of
it
so
big
with
all
the
street
signs
and
the
menus
in
a
different
language
and
so
much
that
was
new
to
learn
what
if
she
failed
to
make
good
on
the
job
that
had
brought
her
over
the
dozen
covers
for
ones
suppose
she
didn
t
have
the
money
to
stay
suppose
she
couldn
t
make
people
understand
her
french
even
though
stasia
had
been
coaching
her
all
week
oh
shut
up
cynthia
miss
mitchall
s
the
old
girl
i
admire
she
said
suddenly
she
s
got
more
courage
you
know
she
s
returning
practically
without
a
job
and
without
money
and
she
s
fifty
if
she
s
a
day
though
she
looks
sixty
poor
darling
i
don
t
believe
she
s
got
ten
dollars
beyond
her
fare
to
what
was
she
doing
in
the
states
asked
stasia
stasia
hadn
t
cynthia
thought
much
imagination
but
perhaps
that
was
because
her
father
was
president
of
the
line
look
at
this
suite
de
luxe
the
best
in
the
ship
and
if
she
had
never
earned
her
own
living
she
couldn
t
imagine
what
it
was
to
be
like
miss
mitchall
oh
she
had
some
sort
of
a
governess
job
but
she
s
english
you
know
and
she
didn
t
come
in
on
the
quota
and
so
she
had
to
go
back
home
she
was
with
a
canadian
family
in
buffalo
they
are
paying
her
fare
back
but
that
s
all
i
wish
she
stopped
she
was
going
to
say
she
wished
she
could
help
her
stasia
looked
at
her
watch
the
little
platinum
watch
circled
with
diamonds
it
s
six
my
dear
and
dinner
s
at
half
past
seven
if
you
re
going
to
get
your
roommate
into
her
costume
you
re
right
you
re
perfectly
cynthia
struggled
into
her
wool
dress
grabbed
the
black
scarf
the
buckled
shoes
threw
the
blouse
over
her
arm
here
give
me
a
hand
with
the
other
stuff
will
you
i
ll
take
the
cynthia
s
small
cabin
was
down
down
two
steep
flights
below
the
cabins
de
luxe
clean
white
corridors
smelling
of
soap
and
sea
and
ship
doors
shut
and
white
doors
open
and
dark
doors
open
and
lighted
a
narrow
corridor
turning
down
to
the
left
two
doors
facing
each
other
the
left
one
always
closed
cynthia
often
wondered
about
that
door
she
knew
the
cabin
was
occupied
because
the
room
steward
went
in
and
out
but
no
one
else
ever
did
the
door
to
the
right
was
cynthia
s
and
miss
mitchall
s
here
we
are
thanks
a
lot
can
i
help
with
or
anything
cynthia
dumped
her
things
on
the
bunk
turned
on
the
lights
no
thanks
the
stewardess
and
lilia
will
help
if
i
want
lilia
was
stasia
s
maid
cynthia
smiled
think
of
having
a
maid
to
yourself
stasia
was
gone
cynthia
hustled
out
of
her
dress
again
turned
on
the
hot
water
whistled
happily
this
was
going
to
be
fun
tonight
like
the
old
art
academy
days
when
everybody
dressed
up
and
the
dances
lasted
till
morning
someone
in
the
cabin
across
the
corridor
coughed
a
man
s
cough
cynthia
turned
off
the
hot
water
and
listened
caught
herself
staring
with
wide
gray
eyes
at
the
wide
gray
eyes
in
the
mirror
over
the
wash
basin
the
night
she
had
come
on
board
that
left
hand
door
had
been
wide
open
and
in
the
corridor
there
had
been
a
suitcase
big
and
black
with
lots
of
stickers
on
it
cynthia
hurrying
along
the
hall
with
an
arm
full
of
last
minute
fruit
and
flowers
and
books
chick
and
judy
and
the
others
of
the
old
art
school
bunch
at
her
heels
had
tripped
and
fallen
full
length
over
that
suitcase
when
chick
had
picked
her
up
unhurt
and
brushed
her
off
she
had
noted
the
suitcase
and
a
huge
ottawa
hotel
paster
on
its
side
bright
with
greens
and
blues
and
oranges
chick
had
noticed
it
too
a
good
poster
design
that
he
had
said
and
cynthia
thinking
about
chick
sat
down
on
the
lower
bunk
and
for
three
minutes
was
devastatingly
and
overwhelmingly
homesick
for
new
york
and
the
studio
for
judy
and
chick
chick
had
in
this
very
room
standing
on
that
very
same
rug
kissed
her
with
his
arms
tight
around
her
and
wished
her
good
luck
and
told
her
how
rotten
it
was
for
him
to
have
to
stay
behind
like
this
keep
my
ring
on
your
finger
and
my
face
in
your
heart
he
had
said
cynthia
twisted
the
pretty
emerald
which
had
belonged
to
chick
s
mother
now
so
ill
that
he
couldn
t
get
away
for
the
trip
they
had
planned
together
it
was
a
sweet
ring
cynthia
s
eyes
were
getting
teary
when
the
dressing
gong
sounded
goodness
was
it
as
late
as
that
the
pirate
costume
had
long
black
trousers
full
ones
from
cynthia
s
beach
pyjamas
a
wide
sash
of
twisted
red
and
green
bristled
with
an
arsenal
of
silver
paper
pistols
and
knives
the
white
blouse
with
sleeves
tacked
very
short
bore
a
black
silk
skull
and
crossbones
over
the
heart
she
was
tying
heavy
thread
on
brass
curtain
rings
to
loop
over
her
ears
when
miss
mitchall
pattered
in
closing
the
door
gently
behind
her
miss
mitchall
s
small
sloping
shoulders
hands
and
thin
blond
hair
now
a
dusty
gray
were
the
characteristics
of
the
english
governess
but
her
eyes
gleamed
brightly
behind
her
spectacles
and
one
felt
that
her
spirit
was
unconquerable
oh
my
dear
how
sweet
you
look
she
twittered
cynthia
hung
an
earring
over
one
ear
and
patted
it
with
a
slim
finger
to
see
if
it
would
swing
free
in
a
minute
she
d
have
to
break
the
news
to
her
roommate
but
miss
mitchall
had
news
of
her
own
i
just
heard
a
voice
across
the
corridor
talking
to
the
steward
it
s
a
man
and
he
talks
with
a
canadian
accent
she
whispered
they
had
both
wondered
about
that
room
for
on
this
small
ship
everyone
seemed
to
know
everyone
else
with
that
exception
was
he
ill
perhaps
that
he
never
came
out
not
even
for
meals
but
there
wasn
t
time
to
discuss
him
now
hurry
and
get
into
your
costume
for
the
party
directed
cynthia
costume
oh
miss
mitchall
was
going
to
appreciate
the
small
jest
you
mean
my
black
she
turned
bustling
a
little
to
put
her
purse
and
book
and
scarf
and
sweater
on
the
long
couch
beneath
the
porthole
no
i
don
t
mean
just
the
black
dress
stated
cynthia
in
what
she
hoped
was
a
firm
tone
i
mean
your
costume
stasia
carruthers
and
i
made
one
for
you
this
afternoon
you
re
going
as
a
green
witch
see
she
took
down
the
tall
peaked
hat
clapped
it
on
the
small
gray
head
and
turned
her
roommate
to
face
the
mirror
then
the
cape
like
she
flung
the
long
cape
around
the
thin
shoulders
of
course
we
must
make
you
up
a
little
powder
on
your
nose
probably
some
rouge
on
your
cheeks
but
put
on
your
black
dress
first
and
oh
my
dear
i
couldn
t
i
m
too
old
what
will
people
think
mildly
clucking
continuing
to
protest
miss
mitchall
was
shoved
into
her
costume
into
the
shoes
with
the
silver
buckles
into
the
long
green
cape
cynthia
against
the
other
s
mild
opposition
patted
rouge
on
the
pale
cheeks
then
flung
a
towel
over
the
cape
and
shook
half
a
box
of
white
talcum
powder
on
the
gray
hair
but
my
dear
beamed
miss
mitchall
it
it
makes
me
look
so
so
indeed
it
did
the
contrast
of
green
cloth
against
the
white
hair
was
dramatic
very
successful
purred
cynthia
you
ll
be
the
belle
of
the
ball
and
it
s
not
immoral
to
look
young
you
know
now
sit
down
there
and
be
good
till
i
get
this
scarf
tied
or
no
ring
for
the
steward
we
must
get
a
broom
to
go
with
the
by
the
time
they
hurried
out
of
their
cabin
the
echoes
of
the
dinner
gong
had
been
dead
for
ten
minutes
but
the
corridors
were
full
of
laughing
groups
harlequins
monks
pierrots
turkish
ladies
dutch
girls
and
nondescript
costumes
that
defied
a
label
for
fear
that
the
green
witch
might
bolt
back
to
the
cabin
cynthia
kept
close
behind
her
but
after
a
few
minutes
realized
this
was
unnecessary
their
passage
was
a
minor
triumphal
procession
for
everyone
turned
to
look
at
them
and
made
some
delighted
exclamation
over
the
novel
costumes
cynthia
was
amused
to
note
that
miss
mitchall
s
sharp
little
chin
went
higher
her
step
became
firmer
as
the
approbation
grew
and
by
the
time
they
reached
the
stairway
to
the
dining
saloon
she
walked
like
a
princess
approaching
her
throne
cheers
and
a
spatter
of
applause
greeted
their
descent
and
three
tables
claimed
their
company
but
cynthia
looked
around
and
made
a
quick
decision
in
a
far
corner
sat
harvey
o
neill
as
the
tin
woodman
and
johnnie
graham
in
sackcloth
and
straw
presumably
a
scarecrow
miss
mitchall
needed
what
only
an
irish
tongue
could
supply
cynthia
steered
toward
the
small
table
may
i
introduce
the
green
witch
of
greenwich
village
sang
cynthia
above
the
hubbub
did
you
know
that
green
witches
had
special
magic
and
charms
much
stronger
than
black
and
white
ones
special
charms
certainly
agreed
the
irishman
come
and
cast
a
spell
on
me
miss
witch
and
he
pulled
out
a
chair
for
her
cynthia
took
the
one
next
to
johnnie
smart
of
you
he
whispered
in
her
ear
to
give
her
a
costume
that
went
with
her
specs
it
s
one
of
the
best
on
the
there
was
an
almost
continual
pageant
down
the
wide
stairs
stasia
made
her
entrance
alone
and
effectively
in
the
long
slinky
costume
of
a
modern
french
doll
from
the
bright
orange
wig
of
knitted
yarn
through
the
high
bodice
and
long
full
skirt
of
brilliant
reds
and
raw
blues
to
the
absurdly
high
heeled
slippers
of
green
satin
and
the
painted
circles
on
her
cheeks
beneath
the
wide
lashed
baby
stare
she
was
perfect
in
every
detail
even
to
a
price
tag
on
her
shoulder
stating
twenty
five
she
was
followed
by
a
spanish
señorita
on
the
arm
of
a
george
belchers
charlady
red
nosed
three
dingy
violets
nodding
in
his
bonnet
as
he
stumbled
apologetically
paused
to
mop
up
the
steps
before
the
señorita
and
dramatized
the
amusing
entrance
how
she
hated
to
have
this
end
cynthia
thought
paris
surely
wasn
t
going
to
be
half
so
much
fun
and
never
to
see
any
of
these
nice
people
again
miss
mitchall
for
instance
it
didn
t
seem
possible
that
you
could
get
to
know
a
person
so
well
and
then
let
them
slip
out
of
your
life
stasia
was
going
to
stay
in
cherbourg
for
a
week
johnnie
where
do
you
go
johnnie
she
asked
straight
through
paris
and
down
to
provence
i
m
studying
the
poetry
of
mistral
who
if
you
don
t
happen
to
know
was
the
greatest
poet
of
southern
france
why
but
she
turned
to
o
neill
and
you
re
going
to
ireland
aren
t
you
yes
better
come
along
he
suggested
it
s
a
bit
of
oh
yes
there
s
a
song
about
that
isn
t
there
she
laughed
weren
t
any
of
these
people
going
to
be
in
paris
suppose
she
couldn
t
get
in
touch
with
the
editor
she
had
come
to
see
suppose
the
job
didn
t
materialize
suppose
well
these
were
nice
cheerful
meditations
to
have
in
the
middle
of
a
party
she
bet
miss
mitchall
wasn
t
harboring
any
such
gloomy
thoughts
suddenly
cynthia
wished
there
was
some
way
some
nice
tactful
subtle
manner
in
which
she
could
help
the
little
governess
without
her
knowing
it
but
a
loan
was
out
of
the
question
cynthia
herself
hadn
t
much
more
than
the
price
of
a
ticket
home
and
you
don
t
pick
up
purses
in
mid
ocean
i
wish
there
was
a
duchess
on
board
with
a
million
pounds
sterling
and
eighteen
children
and
that
she
would
fall
overboard
and
i
could
save
her
life
was
her
fantastic
thought
she
must
have
said
it
out
loud
for
johnnie
murmured
heaven
help
us
and
then
glanced
at
the
little
governess
oh
you
mean
for
miss
mitchall
but
why
stop
at
eighteen
when
you
re
wishing
cynthia
spluttered
into
giggles
and
felt
better
in
fact
she
could
scarcely
eat
her
dinner
for
all
that
was
going
on
around
her
bright
balloons
bumped
her
elbow
a
rain
of
multicolored
confetti
sprinkled
the
table
cloth
and
brilliant
streamers
of
paper
flying
through
the
air
must
be
picked
up
and
returned
lacing
the
dining
saloon
with
carnival
colors
after
dinner
there
was
a
dance
in
the
lounge
cynthia
had
looked
forward
to
it
all
day
and
the
day
before
but
after
a
few
waltzes
and
foxtrots
it
began
somehow
to
fall
flat
everyone
else
seemed
to
be
having
a
perfectly
gorgeous
time
even
little
miss
mitchall
was
plentifully
supplied
with
partners
but
their
enjoyment
seemed
only
to
increase
cynthia
s
gloom
as
every
step
she
made
took
her
nearer
to
the
time
of
leaving
the
ship
to
the
dreaded
unknown
she
knew
what
it
was
she
had
done
too
little
work
for
days
this
wasn
t
the
first
time
that
idleness
had
made
her
miserable
and
it
would
be
useless
to
explain
this
to
her
puzzled
partners
between
dances
she
would
slip
off
and
dive
below
for
her
sketch
pad
drawing
would
bring
the
relief
it
always
had
brought
and
as
for
models
they
were
all
about
her
all
she
needed
was
her
book
to
make
a
record
not
just
of
the
clever
costumes
around
her
but
of
the
movement
and
the
groups
that
the
dancers
made
why
not
get
it
left
for
the
moment
between
dances
without
a
partner
cynthia
decided
that
she
would
and
sped
down
to
the
cabin
as
she
came
along
the
main
corridor
deserted
now
since
all
of
the
room
stewards
were
at
their
dinner
she
heard
a
door
banging
banging
with
the
slow
swing
of
the
ship
and
irritatedly
wondered
why
no
one
had
fastened
it
turning
down
the
small
corridor
that
led
to
her
own
cabin
she
noted
that
the
swinging
door
was
that
opposite
her
own
if
someone
were
ill
in
there
the
door
must
be
extremely
annoying
she
opened
her
own
door
switched
on
the
cabin
light
found
her
sketch
book
and
stepped
out
again
again
the
door
opposite
slammed
back
the
cabin
light
was
on
she
tapped
gently
on
the
doorframe
perhaps
the
occupant
was
too
ill
to
get
up
but
no
one
answered
cynthia
put
her
hand
on
the
knob
to
close
it
but
the
door
was
partly
wedged
by
a
suitcase
which
had
slid
against
it
the
suitcase
which
she
recognized
as
the
same
she
had
tripped
over
when
she
first
came
on
board
or
was
it
the
same
there
was
that
mexican
airways
label
and
next
to
it
a
circular
yellow
paster
which
formed
a
pattern
her
mind
had
already
recorded
but
something
was
missing
she
closed
the
door
gently
shoved
it
to
see
that
it
was
firmly
latched
and
hurried
along
the
corridor
but
as
she
ran
up
the
stairway
she
remembered
what
was
missing
the
ottawa
label
had
been
sponged
off
there
was
a
darker
spot
on
the
leather
where
it
had
been
at
the
entrance
to
the
lounge
the
color
and
light
and
music
burst
on
her
like
a
shower
of
thrown
confetti
figures
whirled
and
swayed
to
the
music
the
room
was
a
shifting
patchwork
of
bright
color
even
miss
mitchall
had
been
persuaded
to
dance
and
jigged
round
and
round
happily
with
a
little
hungarian
whose
bent
knees
and
extreme
speed
were
relics
of
an
older
era
cynthia
passed
behind
the
row
of
chairs
at
the
end
of
the
dance
floor
and
skirted
the
room
to
where
in
a
remote
corner
behind
an
empty
card
table
she
could
be
comfortably
inconspicuous
yet
have
a
good
view
of
the
dancers
she
leafed
through
her
sketch
book
found
some
blank
pages
and
began
to
work
between
encores
the
couples
paused
chatted
and
applauded
that
scarecrow
with
his
whitened
face
and
clay
pipe
cynthia
got
it
with
a
few
strokes
of
the
pencil
then
miss
mitchall
s
rapt
expression
as
she
gazed
into
her
partner
s
face
radiant
unconscious
oh
darn
the
music
had
started
again
cynthia
made
a
dozen
rapid
action
sketches
of
the
dancing
couples
some
of
them
so
close
to
caricatures
she
wouldn
t
have
cared
to
have
the
models
see
them
yawned
and
looked
about
her
perhaps
it
would
be
more
fun
to
go
back
to
dancing
most
of
the
older
people
had
drifted
away
and
were
talking
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
or
had
gone
in
to
the
card
tables
how
different
some
of
them
looked
in
costume
she
would
scarcely
have
recognized
moody
for
instance
in
the
white
hair
and
patches
of
a
colonial
belle
and
the
man
with
her
cynthia
frowned
trying
to
place
him
oh
yes
it
was
the
hat
that
had
put
her
off
he
was
the
man
in
the
golf
cap
who
tramped
the
deck
all
day
long
walking
to
europe
johnnie
graham
had
said
but
the
middle
aged
man
who
sat
alone
not
far
from
cynthia
surely
she
had
never
seen
him
before
surely
she
would
have
remembered
that
nose
the
hollow
cut
deeply
on
either
side
of
it
and
the
thin
lipped
mouth
she
made
a
few
strokes
of
her
pencil
on
the
blank
page
of
her
sketch
book
then
noting
how
still
her
unconscious
model
sat
became
absorbed
in
the
portrait
not
a
good
face
but
a
strong
one
the
brows
were
as
heavy
as
her
pencil
could
etch
the
graying
hair
at
the
temples
disappeared
beneath
the
tightly
drawn
edge
of
a
stocking
cap
and
the
long
chin
dipped
into
a
wide
pierrot
ruff
the
costume
was
that
of
a
harlequin
and
had
probably
been
rented
from
the
ship
s
barber
who
carried
a
stock
of
fancy
costumes
for
these
parties
cynthia
absorbed
in
her
sketch
worked
rapidly
the
hand
that
had
reached
up
to
pull
away
the
ruff
the
long
white
scar
just
showing
at
the
side
of
the
chin
not
an
old
scar
she
thought
for
it
still
showed
pink
at
the
edges
her
model
sat
quietly
unaware
of
the
attention
he
was
receiving
no
that
chin
wasn
t
right
cynthia
flipped
over
another
page
and
made
a
more
detailed
study
of
the
lower
part
of
the
face
this
was
a
type
she
could
use
sometime
in
an
illustration
she
wondered
vaguely
what
the
man
did
when
he
wasn
t
on
ship
board
then
the
music
stopped
perhaps
it
was
that
his
attention
had
wandered
from
the
dancers
or
perhaps
it
was
a
sudden
sense
of
being
watched
but
the
man
turned
quickly
in
his
seat
and
sent
such
a
glare
of
enmity
at
the
astonished
cynthia
that
she
started
and
dropped
her
book
when
she
emerged
from
groping
beneath
the
table
her
model
had
disappeared
he
must
have
moved
very
quickly
for
he
was
already
slipping
through
the
door
cynthia
shook
herself
that
man
certainly
didn
t
like
artists
but
this
was
a
good
waltz
why
not
enjoy
it
it
was
after
midnight
when
she
tiptoed
into
the
cabin
miss
mitchall
was
already
asleep
her
tall
green
hat
and
the
long
cape
were
neatly
disposed
on
the
couch
beneath
the
window
she
was
still
asleep
when
cynthia
dressed
silently
next
morning
when
she
left
for
breakfast
the
dining
saloon
was
almost
deserted
nearly
everyone
seemed
to
be
sleeping
late
or
breakfasting
in
bed
my
last
day
on
shipboard
thought
cynthia
a
little
mournfully
what
to
do
to
stretch
it
out
to
its
full
length
she
decided
to
spend
the
morning
on
deck
sketching
the
afternoon
in
the
lounge
with
a
book
or
perhaps
a
game
of
deck
tennis
with
stasia
but
in
the
middle
of
the
morning
a
thunder
shower
drove
everyone
indoors
and
cynthia
found
stasia
and
her
father
over
coffee
and
toast
in
the
lounge
this
is
dad
s
second
breakfast
and
my
first
announced
stasia
have
some
coffee
cynthia
cynthia
declined
the
coffee
i
was
up
with
the
larks
or
at
least
the
seagulls
she
said
do
you
mind
if
i
sketch
you
while
you
eat
i
ve
wanted
to
get
you
all
but
what
she
really
wanted
was
carruthers
with
his
rugged
beak
of
a
nose
his
thin
slightly
curling
mouth
in
fact
she
became
so
intent
on
her
sketch
that
she
forgot
she
was
supposed
to
be
drawing
stasia
till
the
tall
girl
laughed
dad
she
s
found
you
more
beautiful
than
i
am
what
what
that
so
carruthers
had
been
the
ideal
model
absolutely
unconscious
of
cynthia
s
flying
pencil
it
seemed
only
fair
however
to
show
him
the
drawing
when
it
was
finished
and
this
is
my
roommate
look
stasia
i
got
her
last
night
when
she
was
dancing
with
the
stasia
murmured
wish
i
could
draw
like
carruthers
too
seemed
impressed
good
work
young
lady
he
nodded
but
cynthia
felt
he
wouldn
t
have
much
use
for
artists
he
would
have
all
the
conventional
ideas
about
them
temperament
and
talk
and
starving
in
garrets
stasia
was
turning
the
leaves
slowly
making
here
and
there
a
comment
carruthers
looking
over
her
shoulder
till
he
stopped
her
with
a
large
forefinger
suddenly
on
one
page
who
is
this
where
did
you
sketch
him
he
asked
cynthia
leaned
across
the
table
oh
that
man
isn
t
it
a
wicked
face
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
but
carruthers
was
impatient
he
took
the
book
from
stasia
tell
me
about
this
when
did
you
sketch
this
last
night
and
what
was
this
part
of
the
costume
no
cynthia
laughed
it
was
a
bad
scar
a
fairly
new
one
for
it
was
still
pink
and
i
think
he
had
tried
to
cover
it
with
that
harlequin
ruff
but
when
he
grew
warm
he
forgot
about
it
and
pushed
the
ruff
away
from
his
carruthers
had
already
pushed
the
little
electric
bell
with
an
insistent
finger
before
the
hurrying
steward
had
reached
the
table
carruthers
barked
ask
captain
wain
if
we
can
see
him
immediately
in
his
office
and
tell
the
purser
to
join
us
then
he
turned
to
cynthia
i
d
like
you
to
come
along
and
tell
the
captain
what
you
just
told
me
and
may
we
borrow
your
sketch
book
for
an
hour
or
two
puzzled
and
excited
cynthia
followed
stasia
and
her
father
out
of
the
lounge
down
the
corridor
towards
the
captain
s
office
captain
wain
was
a
plump
little
man
with
a
ruddy
complexion
that
had
weathered
many
storms
white
walrus
whiskers
and
a
blue
uniform
with
lots
of
glittering
buttons
behind
him
stood
the
purser
whom
cynthia
already
knew
a
lean
man
with
small
sharp
eyes
and
an
apologetic
manner
carruthers
held
the
door
for
the
two
girls
then
closed
it
firmly
behind
him
and
plunged
immediately
into
his
subject
it
s
this
matter
of
goncourt
he
stated
and
opened
cynthia
s
sketchbook
where
his
thumb
had
been
keeping
the
place
i
want
you
two
to
see
the
captain
leaned
to
look
at
the
portrait
of
the
man
in
the
ruff
and
passed
it
to
the
purser
with
no
comment
save
a
brief
mmumph
the
purser
examined
it
somewhat
longer
miss
wanstead
made
this
he
asked
cynthia
bewildered
explained
when
and
where
she
had
made
the
sketch
and
questioned
further
explained
about
the
scar
he
really
had
such
a
scar
it
wasn
t
grease
paint
or
whatever
it
is
you
use
on
your
face
cynthia
shook
her
head
you
didn
t
put
things
like
that
in
a
sketch
when
you
were
making
notes
from
real
life
it
was
she
told
them
exactly
as
she
had
drawn
it
she
didn
t
have
any
reason
to
make
it
up
carruthers
sat
down
and
waved
the
others
to
chairs
might
we
he
suggested
see
goncourt
s
passport
again
yes
the
purser
would
bring
it
he
seemed
glad
to
get
away
stasia
who
had
quietly
watched
all
this
now
said
don
t
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
plan
dad
if
we
told
cynthia
what
this
was
all
about
and
at
her
father
s
nod
of
assent
explained
dad
is
owner
of
this
steamship
line
you
see
and
the
night
we
sailed
from
new
york
the
head
of
the
police
department
came
down
to
see
us
off
he
had
come
he
said
especially
to
get
track
of
a
man
with
a
scar
on
his
face
it
was
then
late
in
the
evening
you
see
and
most
of
the
passengers
were
on
board
but
the
purser
examined
all
passports
for
a
man
with
a
scar
like
that
it
was
said
to
be
very
conspicuous
and
the
men
at
the
gate
watched
all
other
passengers
who
came
in
after
that
but
they
decided
that
no
such
man
was
on
he
s
wanted
by
the
police
asked
cynthia
feeling
very
much
like
a
tale
yes
for
smuggling
in
here
is
the
the
purser
returning
had
a
little
blue
book
not
a
dark
red
one
such
as
cynthia
s
in
his
hand
he
passed
the
book
to
the
captain
who
gave
it
a
brief
glance
grunted
and
shoved
it
towards
carruthers
stasia
s
father
compared
the
photograph
to
the
face
in
cynthia
s
sketch
book
but
as
one
was
full
face
the
other
in
profile
little
could
be
gained
by
the
comparison
is
this
the
man
he
asked
cynthia
indicating
the
passport
photograph
cynthia
got
up
and
came
around
the
desk
passport
in
hand
she
moved
to
the
window
for
a
better
light
as
she
examined
the
picture
she
was
aware
of
the
silent
tenseness
behind
her
and
suddenly
had
an
idea
of
how
important
all
this
was
important
to
several
people
closing
her
eyes
she
tried
to
remember
more
fully
the
face
she
had
sketched
not
from
the
side
as
she
had
drawn
him
but
as
he
had
quickly
turned
to
gaze
at
her
full
face
under
the
dark
frowning
brows
then
she
looked
again
at
the
picture
in
her
hand
it
was
very
like
still
no
it
s
not
the
same
there
was
a
little
stir
in
the
room
and
carruthers
got
up
and
came
to
stand
beside
her
but
it
s
very
like
something
teased
at
her
brain
like
and
not
like
like
and
not
like
it
might
be
a
relation
she
hazarded
dubiously
this
man
she
tapped
the
passport
has
had
a
broken
nose
at
some
time
we
had
a
model
with
one
at
the
academy
so
i
recognized
the
peculiar
it
was
not
at
all
like
the
beaky
feature
she
had
sketched
absently
she
gazed
at
the
cover
of
the
passport
what
cabin
is
this
man
in
the
one
with
the
he
s
in
miss
the
purser
answered
and
cynthia
was
in
right
across
the
little
corridor
the
passport
in
her
hand
was
canadian
and
miss
mitchall
had
said
look
here
cynthia
said
suddenly
could
my
roommate
be
called
i
think
she
might
be
able
to
help
us
and
added
you
can
be
sure
she
won
t
the
captain
glanced
dubiously
at
stasia
s
father
the
less
people
who
know
about
this
then
at
the
other
s
nodded
gesture
toward
the
purser
ask
her
to
come
here
he
commanded
gruffly
miss
mitchall
slightly
fluttering
was
produced
almost
immediately
cynthia
didn
t
try
to
explain
the
circumstances
just
showed
her
the
passport
did
you
ever
see
this
man
i
mean
does
he
look
familiar
squinting
the
little
governess
examined
the
picture
then
passed
it
back
with
a
shake
of
her
head
no
my
dear
i
ve
never
seen
there
was
a
sigh
in
the
cabin
but
cynthia
had
not
finished
that
teasing
idea
of
hers
miss
mitchall
had
once
told
her
something
that
bore
on
this
then
if
not
that
man
someone
very
like
him
someone
like
him
surely
but
not
that
man
probably
a
twin
brother
i
was
a
twin
so
that
was
it
cynthia
s
memory
had
almost
but
not
quite
done
the
trick
by
gad
barked
the
captain
the
woman
has
brains
where
did
you
see
this
man
madame
his
tone
was
weighty
with
respect
in
the
cabin
across
from
once
the
door
was
open
as
i
passed
and
he
was
shaving
with
the
light
full
on
his
face
there
was
quite
a
scar
on
his
cheek
he
shut
the
door
with
a
slam
when
he
saw
cynthia
was
still
looking
at
the
passport
in
her
hand
was
this
man
from
ottawa
the
one
you
wanted
she
asked
then
gasped
it
was
almost
as
though
she
had
sprung
a
mine
so
laughably
surprised
were
the
faces
about
her
how
did
you
know
that
the
captain
s
gruff
tones
held
suspicion
but
cynthia
had
suddenly
remembered
the
suitcase
she
had
stumbled
over
the
first
day
and
the
dark
patch
that
showed
some
label
had
been
removed
from
it
you
see
she
explained
further
i
m
accustomed
to
remembering
the
shapes
and
colors
of
things
perhaps
more
than
most
people
do
because
that
s
part
of
my
job
i
remembered
an
ottawa
paster
on
the
suitcase
because
of
a
certain
clever
arrangement
of
colors
green
and
blue
and
carruthers
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
stepping
into
the
doorway
he
spoke
a
moment
in
a
low
voice
to
the
steward
outside
then
returned
to
the
room
will
you
describe
this
label
for
us
or
could
you
draw
it
it
s
something
like
cynthia
took
the
pencil
out
of
her
pocket
and
made
a
little
diagram
on
a
blank
page
of
her
note
book
it
had
an
orange
moon
and
a
tower
rather
medieval
dark
blue
against
it
then
there
was
a
jiggley
border
of
green
in
this
the
steward
with
something
in
his
hand
stood
in
the
doorway
carruthers
rose
and
brought
in
a
suitcase
not
the
black
one
but
a
small
airplane
case
he
turned
it
around
so
that
all
might
see
the
ottawa
label
exactly
as
cynthia
had
sketched
it
we
were
in
ottawa
a
few
weeks
ago
he
explained
and
i
remembered
this
label
on
our
bag
you
see
he
turned
to
cynthia
this
man
is
wanted
in
canada
for
jewel
stealing
the
police
of
ottawa
had
wired
the
police
of
new
york
to
watch
for
him
on
any
boat
leaving
port
within
the
next
few
days
i
believe
he
has
sailed
on
this
line
before
but
we
have
to
be
awfully
sure
before
we
can
make
an
arrest
the
publicity
if
the
man
were
innocent
would
be
unpleasant
for
the
steamship
i
ll
go
and
make
the
arrest
the
captain
departed
taking
the
purser
with
him
stasia
who
had
been
quiet
as
a
mouse
all
this
time
prodded
her
father
with
a
finger
daddy
tell
cynthia
the
rest
of
oh
yes
ah
carruthers
cleared
his
throat
a
hum
we
are
extremely
grateful
to
you
ladies
miss
wanstead
and
miss
mitchall
it
would
have
been
awkward
if
he
had
escaped
by
our
line
of
course
you
understand
that
there
is
a
reward
for
information
leading
to
his
arrest
and
i
think
we
can
say
that
the
reward
will
be
yours
if
this
is
goncourt
as
we
now
fully
and
to
think
that
it
really
was
goncourt
and
that
he
has
been
in
that
cabin
all
the
week
thrilled
miss
mitchall
for
the
hundredth
time
cynthia
grinned
and
to
think
of
your
suggesting
the
twin
business
of
your
knowing
it
was
a
canadian
accent
that
was
really
as
important
as
the
sketch
you
see
he
got
the
scar
in
ottawa
when
he
made
a
big
haul
of
some
jewels
about
a
year
ago
and
then
he
went
to
quebec
and
did
the
same
thing
but
then
he
used
the
picture
of
a
twin
brother
on
his
passport
and
covered
the
scar
with
a
muffler
when
he
came
on
board
i
suppose
he
was
afraid
to
go
out
of
his
cabin
very
how
like
a
wallace
novel
cynthia
went
on
folding
things
to
put
into
her
suitcase
in
another
minute
she
could
close
it
not
to
be
opened
again
until
she
was
in
france
i
wonder
she
asked
without
turning
if
you
would
do
me
a
great
favor
why
of
course
my
dear
what
is
it
well
you
see
this
reward
business
is
rather
a
cynthia
didn
t
say
that
stasia
had
warned
her
it
might
be
some
weeks
before
the
check
got
through
i
wonder
if
you
would
take
some
of
my
money
now
as
part
of
your
share
if
i
have
too
much
i
m
liable
to
spend
it
on
paris
hats
and
foolish
things
you
see
perhaps
a
hundred
now
and
when
the
check
comes
i
ll
send
you
the
rest
of
your
for
a
moment
cynthia
was
afraid
miss
mitchall
would
see
through
her
plan
and
refuse
but
the
little
governess
smiled
and
nodded
yes
she
knew
how
tempting
paris
was
if
you
had
money
yes
she
d
be
glad
to
take
some
of
it
now
cynthia
snapped
off
the
light
and
hauled
herself
into
the
upper
bunk
paris
tomorrow
but
she
wasn
t
afraid
of
her
luck
any
more
she
d
proved
it
would
stand
by
her
chapter
corned
beef
hash
steamship
and
steamer
friends
had
been
left
behind
paris
was
ahead
closer
now
with
every
minute
every
hurrying
second
the
little
french
girl
who
had
kept
on
her
hat
and
gloves
and
had
read
in
silence
a
paper
covered
copy
of
anatole
france
all
the
way
from
cherbourg
let
down
the
window
leaned
out
to
wave
a
beckoning
hand
and
shouted
porteur
cynthia
waited
patiently
but
as
the
other
seemed
in
no
haste
to
relinquish
her
place
at
the
window
the
american
finally
leaned
over
the
french
girl
s
shoulder
and
beckoned
in
similar
fashion
the
long
train
slid
gently
to
a
stop
and
a
score
of
stout
little
blue
smocked
men
seemed
to
spring
from
the
ground
and
began
taking
baggage
from
the
open
windows
loading
it
on
wide
straps
over
their
sturdy
shoulders
cynthia
captured
the
eye
of
number
a
beady
eye
above
a
red
nose
and
a
moustache
that
would
have
graced
a
member
of
the
beggar
s
opera
she
gulped
taxi
thank
goodness
there
was
a
word
that
meant
the
same
in
several
languages
at
which
he
grinned
cheerfully
and
slung
her
heavy
suitcase
and
her
paint
box
in
one
huge
paw
the
other
grasped
her
neighbor
s
bags
and
the
whole
strange
and
unwieldy
combination
lumbered
off
down
the
platform
was
he
gone
for
good
better
follow
that
french
girl
cynthia
decided
she
seemed
unconcerned
oh
one
had
to
give
up
the
ticket
here
and
there
was
the
porter
again
no
more
customs
that
had
all
been
cleared
at
the
quay
earlier
in
the
morning
the
street
met
her
with
a
blast
of
warm
july
air
a
dazzle
of
summer
sunlight
and
such
a
medley
of
strange
noises
taxis
hooting
in
a
new
high
key
voices
mingled
shouts
and
confusion
that
she
stood
for
a
moment
bewildered
and
lost
horrid
luck
that
no
one
she
knew
from
the
boat
had
been
coming
to
paris
on
this
train
then
cynthia
saw
that
her
bag
and
paint
box
had
been
piled
into
a
taxi
like
a
shiny
black
beetle
and
the
blue
smocked
one
waited
for
his
she
tipped
him
ten
francs
was
that
too
much
or
too
little
she
had
been
warned
that
in
either
case
he
would
glare
but
this
one
smiled
muttered
and
departed
the
hotel
address
was
written
on
a
card
and
cynthia
had
only
to
show
that
to
the
driver
hop
in
and
they
were
off
well
well
so
this
is
paris
well
cynthia
giggled
nervously
to
be
really
here
to
have
arrived
safely
all
by
herself
well
that
was
something
paris
she
sighed
relaxed
back
against
the
cushions
and
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
oh
the
taxi
was
stopping
her
eyes
popped
open
just
a
little
policeman
in
a
toy
soldier
cape
and
a
white
stick
with
which
he
seemed
miraculously
to
hold
up
this
mad
traffic
off
again
she
shut
her
eyes
once
more
new
smells
hot
asphalt
violets
damp
warm
air
something
cooking
other
things
she
just
couldn
t
keep
her
eyes
shut
the
car
was
running
along
gray
cobbles
between
gray
houses
high
and
incredibly
ancient
tall
plane
trees
leaned
out
over
gray
walls
that
held
in
a
silvery
stream
the
seine
a
little
gay
colored
steamer
like
a
miniature
hooted
and
put
off
from
a
landing
cynthia
wanted
to
hug
it
all
at
once
to
pinch
herself
to
be
sure
she
was
here
how
she
wished
judy
could
see
it
and
chick
dear
chick
this
was
to
have
been
their
honeymoon
he
d
be
over
shortly
a
few
weeks
at
the
most
and
meanwhile
there
was
work
to
be
done
a
language
to
learn
nancy
and
brewster
to
see
and
covers
to
be
done
for
one
s
was
that
could
that
possibly
be
notre
dame
over
there
to
the
left
and
the
eiffel
tower
clear
ahead
misty
against
sunny
sky
she
had
seen
it
as
they
came
in
on
the
train
really
paris
not
a
motion
picture
chuckled
cynthia
and
tomorrow
she
could
go
and
see
it
all
for
herself
then
a
second
bridge
place
michel
and
a
swift
turn
to
the
left
into
a
narrow
street
where
noises
echoed
back
from
the
high
stone
houses
to
right
and
left
they
drew
up
before
a
door
and
a
boy
in
a
horizontal
striped
waistcoat
and
white
shirt
sleeves
came
out
from
the
hotel
entrance
here
was
her
home
in
paris
inside
at
the
little
desk
they
had
a
key
for
her
room
and
a
letter
from
brewster
who
had
made
her
reservation
for
her
there
was
a
little
elevator
into
which
one
squeezed
barely
avoiding
the
folding
doors
and
then
up
up
like
a
wobbly
balloon
a
hallway
musty
and
dark
and
at
last
a
tall
room
with
two
high
french
windows
opening
on
to
a
small
balcony
yes
this
will
do
nicely
said
cynthia
in
her
best
french
and
so
moved
into
paris
when
the
door
closed
cynthia
sat
down
to
catch
her
breath
so
much
had
happened
in
the
last
half
hour
she
had
seen
so
much
that
was
new
and
strange
and
lovely
i
suppose
there
are
people
that
live
in
paris
all
the
time
and
take
it
as
a
matter
of
course
she
told
herself
and
i
suppose
i
shall
get
to
take
it
that
way
too
after
a
bit
but
now
it
s
all
rather
frightening
i
wonder
if
i
can
make
myself
understood
i
wonder
if
i
shall
get
lost
i
wonder
oh
goodness
how
shall
i
order
meals
but
perhaps
menu
french
is
the
same
brewster
s
letter
was
reassuring
she
seemed
to
think
cynthia
would
find
everything
very
simple
and
easy
but
i
am
giving
you
the
address
of
a
little
french
girl
who
speaks
excellent
english
she
was
a
governess
in
london
for
some
years
if
you
get
lonely
or
wish
to
improve
your
accent
ha
don
t
hesitate
to
look
her
enclosed
was
also
a
note
from
nancy
do
come
to
conquet
she
begged
mother
and
i
are
both
painting
here
it
s
all
pearly
gray
mists
and
long
empty
beaches
and
sabots
and
fish
and
steep
streets
and
old
houses
and
you
can
find
lots
of
children
to
pose
for
your
it
did
sound
fun
but
paris
seemed
quite
enough
adventure
for
the
moment
and
cynthia
s
purse
was
very
flat
she
must
first
see
culbert
who
was
over
here
now
and
was
the
editor
of
the
magazine
for
which
she
had
a
contract
for
a
dozen
covers
see
if
she
couldn
t
get
an
advance
on
the
first
order
and
if
he
could
put
her
in
touch
with
a
way
to
get
models
just
at
the
moment
she
hadn
t
the
slightest
idea
how
to
go
about
getting
one
for
the
painting
she
must
do
she
sat
down
and
wrote
to
nancy
planning
to
mail
the
letter
when
she
went
out
to
dinner
then
leaning
out
on
the
little
balcony
she
watched
the
light
fade
in
the
street
below
listening
to
the
sounds
of
paris
echo
up
between
the
ancient
stained
backward
sloping
housefronts
what
she
wondered
with
a
little
pang
of
homesickness
were
they
doing
now
at
home
six
o
clock
but
no
time
was
different
was
it
three
over
there
or
nine
now
the
mental
gymnastics
made
her
head
reel
and
she
decided
that
she
was
hungry
but
plenty
of
time
yet
cynthia
hated
to
admit
to
herself
that
she
dreaded
that
first
meal
alone
doubted
her
ability
to
order
food
even
to
find
her
way
home
again
once
she
had
set
her
foot
off
the
hotel
doorstep
it
was
after
eight
o
clock
when
she
finally
tore
herself
away
from
the
window
and
summoned
courage
to
go
out
for
dinner
you
can
t
starve
till
morning
idiot
she
told
herself
severely
just
walk
downstairs
and
out
the
door
there
must
be
lots
of
places
to
eat
within
the
next
two
blocks
why
france
is
a
nation
of
cooks
a
short
way
up
the
boule
miche
she
found
a
little
place
with
pretty
checked
table
cloths
on
the
iron
topped
tables
behind
dusty
box
hedges
in
their
wooden
boxes
this
was
pleasantly
removed
from
a
small
band
that
was
playing
lustily
and
not
too
melodiously
on
the
street
corner
funny
about
those
bands
she
had
passed
three
in
the
short
distance
from
the
hotel
and
another
had
begun
playing
beneath
her
window
just
as
she
went
out
no
one
else
seemed
to
be
eating
perhaps
french
people
dined
later
than
this
the
menu
was
as
much
an
enigma
as
she
had
expected
it
was
written
in
a
flowing
spencerian
hand
in
dim
violet
ink
on
a
limp
and
bit
of
paper
hardly
a
word
seemed
legible
and
none
of
it
was
intelligible
goodness
murmured
cynthia
and
looked
about
her
could
she
get
up
and
leave
and
try
another
place
but
the
waiter
had
already
placed
a
napkin
beside
her
fork
and
knife
beside
the
napkin
cynthia
decided
she
hadn
t
the
moral
courage
to
rise
and
depart
well
here
goes
bring
me
some
of
that
and
that
and
that
she
directed
and
pointed
near
the
center
of
the
page
the
main
body
of
a
meal
always
came
near
the
middle
of
the
menu
didn
t
it
the
waiter
who
wore
a
spotty
black
dinner
jacket
and
a
white
apron
broke
into
a
voluble
explanation
of
some
sort
evidently
they
were
out
of
this
would
mademoiselle
not
prefer
that
mademoiselle
nodded
in
agreement
yes
anything
oui
oui
the
waiter
departed
on
swift
feet
cynthia
wondered
what
he
would
bring
what
he
brought
was
a
strange
piece
of
pink
meat
swimming
in
a
cold
bath
of
oil
this
she
poked
about
with
a
fork
wondering
what
particular
portion
of
what
animal
it
might
be
it
hardly
seemed
edible
and
certainly
though
she
was
hungry
she
was
not
yet
hungry
enough
for
that
after
a
long
time
the
waiter
seemed
to
appreciate
that
she
had
finished
with
that
course
and
brought
her
some
hot
boiled
potatoes
these
were
more
palatable
and
bread
helped
too
then
came
a
small
white
something
wrapped
in
tin
foil
and
served
with
a
large
salt
shaker
but
the
foil
proved
to
contain
a
small
roll
of
really
delicious
cream
cheese
and
eaten
with
sugar
which
came
from
the
large
salt
shaker
and
more
of
the
crisp
french
bread
it
served
to
round
off
the
simple
meal
i
suppose
i
have
eaten
thought
cynthia
as
she
wandered
home
again
i
wish
i
weren
t
still
so
hungry
at
least
that
meal
was
cheap
and
that
s
important
at
the
but
she
continued
to
think
of
hot
beefsteaks
and
hot
muffins
and
hot
chicken
pies
and
what
she
wouldn
t
do
to
a
big
plate
of
ham
and
eggs
oh
dear
but
tomorrow
she
d
try
another
place
perhaps
that
wasn
t
a
really
good
example
of
french
cooking
as
she
strolled
slowly
back
towards
the
hotel
all
the
little
bands
were
going
full
force
cynthia
noticed
that
people
were
beginning
to
dance
under
the
lights
on
the
hard
cobbled
pavements
to
the
jiggling
monotonous
tunes
she
leaned
for
a
while
against
the
closed
iron
shutter
of
a
shop
and
watched
the
gay
crowds
gather
they
seemed
very
happy
was
it
some
celebration
she
wondered
or
did
french
people
always
dance
like
this
in
the
evening
the
musicians
beneath
her
window
were
in
fine
fettle
tootling
sawing
and
bumping
away
at
no
particular
tune
but
just
a
sort
of
penny
whistle
noise
with
a
strongly
marked
rhythm
for
the
dancers
she
sat
in
her
window
watching
them
till
she
got
so
sleepy
she
could
no
longer
keep
her
eyes
open
then
deciding
they
d
probably
keep
it
up
pretty
late
till
ten
or
maybe
eleven
crawled
into
bed
it
had
been
a
long
day
since
cherbourg
that
morning
and
in
spite
of
the
band
which
surely
must
stop
before
midnight
she
thought
she
could
sleep
but
the
monotonous
tuneless
sound
seemed
to
go
round
and
round
and
round
inside
her
head
she
dreamed
that
she
was
waltzing
rapidly
with
the
of
the
striped
waistcoat
with
madame
in
her
black
taffeta
dress
and
wide
gold
chain
with
the
black
cat
of
the
restaurant
then
woke
to
hear
the
band
still
scraping
and
bumping
merrily
foggily
she
struggled
out
of
bed
and
closed
first
the
heavy
wooden
shutters
then
the
window
and
went
back
to
sleep
with
her
head
hot
under
the
bedclothes
twice
she
woke
again
at
odd
hours
but
always
that
rhythm
penetrated
the
darkness
then
she
woke
again
surprisingly
all
was
still
how
blissful
that
was
she
was
sure
the
musicians
had
stopped
only
a
short
time
ago
and
waited
tensely
to
see
if
they
would
start
again
but
there
was
no
sound
then
rolling
over
with
aching
head
she
saw
that
light
streamed
from
between
the
chinks
of
the
shutters
and
that
her
watch
said
seven
o
clock
she
opened
her
window
went
back
to
bed
and
slept
till
nine
then
she
wandered
out
to
find
breakfast
only
a
gnawing
hunger
had
made
her
get
up
at
all
strangely
enough
none
of
the
restaurants
seemed
to
be
open
she
peered
in
at
two
between
drawn
net
curtains
to
see
chairs
piled
on
empty
tables
and
boys
washing
down
the
floors
then
rounding
a
corner
cynthia
came
full
on
the
seine
between
its
gray
stone
banks
and
a
gray
stone
bridge
beyond
which
loomed
full
in
the
summer
sunlight
the
twin
towers
of
notre
dame
de
paris
oh
lovely
along
the
embankment
were
the
tiny
stalls
of
the
booksellers
all
closed
now
didn
t
paris
people
go
to
work
until
noon
she
wondered
then
at
the
end
of
the
block
facing
a
small
open
square
she
saw
a
sign
which
read
here
perhaps
she
could
get
some
sort
of
meal
outdoors
under
a
gay
striped
awning
she
found
a
little
wicker
table
with
a
red
and
white
top
and
wicker
chairs
a
big
black
cat
with
a
white
bib
and
green
eyes
gave
her
welcome
with
purrs
and
ankle
rubbings
this
was
going
to
be
jolly
she
stammered
her
desire
for
chocolate
and
learned
that
little
breads
and
butter
could
also
be
procured
and
that
little
breads
were
really
crisp
warm
rolls
notre
dame
faced
her
serene
solid
impregnable
when
breakfast
was
over
she
d
go
across
and
visit
the
church
and
stroll
along
by
the
river
this
must
be
the
famous
left
bank
where
all
the
artists
and
students
lived
the
cat
rubbed
purring
about
the
table
and
a
small
boy
with
eyes
as
softly
dark
as
the
cat
s
fur
and
clad
in
a
diminutive
smock
of
black
with
a
small
black
beret
perched
on
his
dark
curls
came
out
to
stare
solemnly
at
this
stranger
cynthia
buttered
a
piece
of
roll
and
offered
it
to
him
with
a
shy
muttered
in
an
oddly
deep
voice
he
took
it
bolted
it
and
watched
for
the
next
mouthful
cynthia
grinned
at
him
ate
a
bit
herself
and
gave
him
thereafter
alternate
bites
by
the
time
two
rolls
were
finished
and
the
big
pitcher
of
hot
chocolate
was
drained
to
the
last
sweet
drop
the
small
boy
had
smiled
also
had
told
her
that
his
name
was
nono
and
that
he
lived
here
here
at
last
was
a
friend
tomorrow
she
d
bring
a
sketchbook
to
breakfast
when
tomorrow
came
nono
appeared
along
with
his
black
cat
for
more
bits
of
warm
roll
but
this
time
he
smiled
immediately
crinkling
his
dark
eyes
with
an
amused
and
delightful
welcome
when
his
father
brought
the
chocolate
he
said
something
in
brief
reproof
but
cynthia
protested
let
him
stay
she
begged
and
displayed
her
sketchbook
the
man
grinned
and
nodded
he
knew
about
artists
and
explained
to
the
boy
that
he
must
sit
still
for
mademoiselle
whereat
nono
climbed
into
one
of
the
café
chairs
and
grasping
firm
hold
of
the
huge
and
somewhat
reluctant
cat
proceeded
to
demonstrate
that
he
was
born
to
be
an
artist
s
model
oh
this
was
glorious
cynthia
s
fingers
flew
to
get
it
all
down
before
it
could
dissolve
and
when
the
cat
finally
went
calmly
to
sleep
nono
continued
to
sit
immovable
wide
eyed
minutes
on
minutes
cynthia
got
more
and
more
thrilled
it
was
going
to
be
a
honey
of
a
sketch
she
wondered
if
maybe
colors
tomorrow
at
last
she
nodded
to
the
child
he
laughed
and
stretched
and
dumped
the
sleeping
cat
from
his
knees
cynthia
put
two
francs
in
his
small
hand
was
that
she
wondered
too
much
or
too
little
it
was
what
her
breakfast
had
cost
her
apparently
by
his
reception
it
was
all
right
tomorrow
she
asked
in
french
and
pointed
toward
the
chair
again
oui
agreed
nono
then
he
must
know
that
artists
sometimes
wanted
one
to
pose
again
that
was
on
sunday
saturday
had
not
been
strikingly
successful
for
some
reason
perhaps
because
it
was
saturday
everything
banks
and
the
express
company
culbert
s
office
and
most
of
the
museums
cynthia
wished
to
visit
had
been
closed
monday
of
course
they
would
be
open
again
and
she
could
get
in
touch
with
culbert
cynthia
s
money
was
running
low
and
she
must
ask
for
an
advance
on
the
first
cover
and
must
find
some
way
to
get
in
touch
with
models
to
work
from
but
monday
was
no
better
than
sunday
nor
than
saturday
had
been
the
band
for
the
third
time
had
played
all
night
and
cynthia
had
slept
fitfully
hot
and
miserable
in
the
closed
noisy
room
she
awoke
feeling
as
though
she
could
sleep
for
a
week
then
she
remembered
nono
here
at
last
was
one
bright
spot
in
paris
she
hurried
out
to
breakfast
with
her
large
sketch
pad
and
her
color
box
under
her
arm
nono
was
waiting
for
her
and
so
was
the
black
cat
cynthia
was
ravenously
hungry
a
continental
breakfast
wasn
t
enough
food
to
last
one
through
a
day
of
sightseeing
and
so
far
she
had
found
no
good
place
to
eat
hastily
she
drank
her
chocolate
shared
a
double
order
of
rolls
and
butter
with
the
somewhat
greedy
little
nono
she
herself
was
anxious
to
get
to
work
on
this
color
sketch
nono
complete
with
the
large
sleepy
cat
clambered
into
his
wicker
chair
the
sunlight
reflected
warm
and
yellow
beneath
his
chin
and
his
eyes
were
half
closed
amusingly
in
the
glare
the
black
smock
seemed
almost
a
dark
green
in
contrast
to
the
cat
s
soft
fur
and
beyond
them
was
the
red
and
white
ruffle
of
the
awning
a
brilliant
splash
of
warm
color
cynthia
asked
to
have
her
little
painting
pail
filled
with
water
sketched
in
the
brief
outline
of
her
composition
and
slashed
happily
into
color
once
she
said
mechanically
rest
and
found
that
the
boy
understood
in
a
few
minutes
he
returned
to
his
place
the
cat
was
a
little
different
but
cynthia
had
allowed
for
that
and
now
sketched
him
in
and
completed
that
part
of
the
drawing
all
in
one
pose
the
drawing
was
emerging
with
both
charm
and
strength
black
red
and
warm
flesh
tones
accented
with
the
green
of
the
cat
s
eyes
and
one
white
paw
lifted
to
rest
against
nono
s
black
smock
this
thought
cynthia
was
one
of
the
nicest
things
she
had
ever
done
even
fatigue
and
hunger
seemed
to
have
added
to
her
ability
since
her
senses
seemed
sharpened
nerves
tautened
by
the
past
two
days
she
had
decided
to
go
that
afternoon
and
find
the
little
french
girl
brewster
had
recommended
for
language
lessons
her
visit
to
the
express
company
and
to
the
office
where
she
had
hoped
to
find
culbert
were
as
unsuccessful
as
saturday
s
visits
everything
was
still
closed
tight
cynthia
was
beginning
to
worry
she
had
only
a
few
hundred
francs
about
fifteen
dollars
left
in
her
purse
and
there
was
no
telling
how
long
this
celebration
might
last
it
puzzled
her
she
had
asked
madame
at
the
desk
and
had
learned
that
it
was
the
fourteenth
of
july
whatever
that
was
but
friday
had
been
the
fourteenth
surely
they
didn
t
celebrate
america
s
fourth
of
july
over
here
did
they
foggily
she
tried
to
connect
it
with
lafayette
and
the
two
revolutions
but
couldn
t
make
it
out
everywhere
the
little
street
bands
continued
to
play
and
people
continued
to
dance
in
the
streets
still
pondering
on
this
mystery
she
found
the
house
on
the
boulevard
michel
that
bore
the
address
of
the
mademoiselle
menard
brewster
had
explained
that
she
lived
on
the
fifth
floor
and
that
in
france
the
first
floor
is
not
the
ground
floor
nor
the
next
which
is
called
the
entresol
you
have
to
go
up
two
flights
to
get
to
the
first
floor
and
then
begin
to
count
from
there
they
were
long
flights
too
and
cynthia
had
begun
to
feel
a
little
faint
by
the
time
she
reached
the
top
when
she
found
culbert
if
she
ever
did
she
would
certainly
beg
him
to
take
her
out
for
a
real
dinner
cynthia
put
her
finger
on
the
large
white
push
button
and
a
bell
pealed
somewhere
way
off
inside
but
no
one
answered
it
after
a
bit
she
tried
again
and
then
again
what
should
she
do
next
she
already
had
visited
notre
dame
and
knew
the
cluny
and
luxembourg
gardens
for
the
past
two
days
as
well
as
the
palm
of
her
hand
besides
she
still
felt
strangely
faint
she
leaned
against
the
heavy
stone
balustrade
and
looked
down
suddenly
up
through
the
hallway
wafted
from
below
came
the
most
glorious
and
enchanting
odor
cynthia
closed
her
eyes
it
made
her
think
of
home
of
a
loaded
dinner
table
with
big
plates
of
hash
with
an
egg
on
top
slabs
of
bread
and
butter
and
a
thick
slice
of
apple
pie
with
cheese
oh
dear
like
a
good
little
hound
following
the
scent
cynthia
hypnotized
by
that
delicious
smell
stepped
down
step
after
step
to
the
floor
below
still
that
beckoning
delightful
odor
another
flight
it
was
stronger
now
over
the
banisters
heavens
thought
cynthia
how
can
i
ever
stand
this
here
was
the
door
and
she
had
tracked
it
to
its
lair
a
door
heavy
and
thick
and
solid
like
those
above
it
was
open
just
a
crack
which
was
why
the
lovely
smell
had
wandered
out
cynthia
leaned
against
the
doorpost
there
were
tears
of
hunger
and
of
homesickness
in
her
eyes
as
she
sniffed
and
sniffed
onions
in
that
hash
too
no
calves
head
in
cold
oil
here
no
tough
thin
steaks
that
might
or
might
not
be
horsemeat
then
the
door
opened
with
a
and
cynthia
almost
fell
through
it
into
the
hall
beyond
ello
said
a
cheery
voice
in
french
another
girl
shorter
than
cynthia
but
about
her
own
age
with
an
amusing
long
nose
twinkly
brown
eyes
her
hair
covered
by
a
chic
little
straw
hat
with
a
red
quill
a
white
wool
dress
embroidered
in
red
the
girl
continued
to
chatter
something
in
french
cynthia
looked
as
blank
as
a
brick
wall
she
had
been
wrenched
all
too
suddenly
from
that
say
cried
the
girl
suddenly
you
re
an
american
too
aren
t
you
cynthia
could
have
hugged
her
right
then
and
there
why
she
hadn
t
heard
a
word
of
english
for
three
whole
days
oh
she
almost
shouted
and
oh
is
that
hash
you
are
cooking
the
girl
giggled
then
sniffed
appreciatively
does
smell
good
doesn
t
it
mother
s
a
swell
cook
look
here
she
opened
the
door
that
had
half
closed
behind
her
hey
mums
have
we
got
enough
for
a
guest
and
before
cynthia
could
object
had
shoved
her
ahead
down
the
hallway
into
a
wide
room
lit
by
late
sunlight
take
off
your
mittens
and
bonnet
and
shawl
laughed
the
girl
you
re
invited
to
dinner
that
is
if
you
can
stay
mums
this
is
miss
america
winner
of
all
beauty
prizes
to
date
isn
t
she
pretty
heavens
how
the
girl
did
rattle
on
thought
the
amused
cynthia
i
found
her
fainting
on
our
doorstep
and
brought
her
mums
was
wide
and
comfortable
looking
in
a
huge
white
apron
and
carried
a
in
her
hand
she
seemed
unperturbed
by
her
daughter
s
nonsense
my
name
s
wanstead
cynthia
explained
the
owner
of
that
name
and
i
do
hope
you
will
forgive
me
i
sniffed
your
delicious
cooking
two
flights
good
grief
i
must
have
left
that
door
open
again
rattled
the
girl

d
just
about

our
french
lease
if
they
sniff
our
cooking
in
the
hall
oh
i
forgot

name

murchison
this
is
murchison
my
honored
parent
listen
i
ve
got
to
run
out
with
some
letters
for
the
post
sit
still
and
i
ll
be
back
in
a
cynthia
was
only
too
glad
to
sit
normally
she
would
have
protested
more
strongly
against
their
forced
hospitality
but
today
homesick
and
genuinely
hungry
and
considerably
worried
about
the
future
she
found
this
american
household
irresistible
murchison
puttered
into
the
room
and
out
again
murmuring
absentmindedly
father
loves
hash
can
t
get
french
cook
to
make
it
properly
marie
our
cook
gone
home
for
the
holidays
and
still
murmuring
disappeared
at
last
in
the
direction
of
the
kitchen
over
the
delicious
dinner
cynthia
heard
the
story
of
the
mysterious
holiday
it
s
the
jour
de
bastille
alice
explained
to
her
in
celebration
of
the
destruction
of
that
beastly
prison
the
french
never
have
a
they
save
it
up
and
make
four
days
of
it
father
s
in
the
consular
service
and
had
to
be
home
for
tomorrow
morning
but
most
americans
who
live
here
plan
to
stay
out
of
paris
during
these
four
days
they
re
so
noisy
our
cook
won
t
be
worth
her
salt
for
the
next
week
she
ll
be
so
sleepy
if
you
ask
me
you
look
half
i
ve
had
one
of
those
bands
under
my
window
for
the
past
three
nights
apologized
cynthia
please
can
i
have
some
more
hash
save
room
for
real
american
ice
cream
advised
her
hostess
and
when
dinner
was
over
i
m
going
to
tuck
you
into
bed
right
away
you
poor
thing
it
s
only
seven
and
you
can
sleep
till
ten
or
eleven
then
i
ll
wake
you
to
go
home
come
on
my
room
is
at
the
back
on
the
garden
you
won
t
hear
a
single
drum
or
whistle
or
even
a
taxi
cynthia
was
too
weary
to
utter
more
than
a
feeble
protest
it
seems
kind
of
funny
to
break
into
a
stranger
s
house
eat
their
hash
and
go
to
sleep
in
their
bed
she
murmured
as
she
slipped
off
her
shoes
take
off
your
dress
that
s
right
i
ll
just
throw
a
blanket
over
you
and
open
this
window
a
little
sleep
cynthia
started
to
call
don
t
fail
to
wake
me
but
must
have
been
asleep
before
she
could
speak
the
words
at
least
when
she
awoke
an
apparent
few
minutes
later
the
sentence
still
hung
unuttered
in
her
mind
she
stretched
blinked
fumbled
for
her
thoughts
then
glared
at
the
window
it
was
full
daylight
frantically
she
bent
to
look
at
her
watch
it
had
stopped
then
it
next
day
the
little
clock
on
the
bureau
said
eight
o
clock
and
then
alice
tousle
headed
in
bright
pink
pyjamas
peeped
round
the
edge
of
the
door
hello
you
gosh
how
you
did
sleep
are
you
by
any
chance
a
descendant
of
the
sleeping
beauty
i
phoned
your
hotel
so
they
wouldn
t
think
you
had
got
run
over
and
went
in
to
sleep
with
she
pranced
into
the
room
and
perched
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
it
s
a
swell
day
and
things
started
to
move
again
today
you
ll
find
your
little
editor
chap
no
doubt
will
you
have
your
breakfast
on
a
tray
in
here
milady
and
go
back
to
sleep
again
goodness
no
oh
i
feel
cynthia
swung
her
feet
out
of
bed
it
was
nearly
noon
however
when
cynthia
sent
her
name
to
culbert
the
editor
of
ones
he
came
out
immediately
a
plump
little
man
with
a
round
jolly
face
and
held
out
both
hands
beaming
his
welcome
such
a
shame
you
landed
here
in
the
middle
of
the
holiday

was
down
in
the
south
of
france

the
owner
of
the
magazine
but
got
back
last
night

covers

a
bit
difficult
children

bit
cynthia

eyes

dancing

lean
back

glad
to

back
to
the
states
myself
now
let
s
see
he
had
chatted
incessantly
as
he
led
the
way
into
a
room
resembling
more
a
window
display
of
a
decorator
s
shop
than
an
office
cynthia
perched
on
the
corner
of
the
elaborate
inlaid
desk
and
slipped
the
wrapper
off
her
drawing
the
one
nono
over
her
second
breakfast

finished
posing
for
just
a
half
hour
ago
here

liked
it
she
could
tell
by
his
face
sa
ay
that
s
fine
my
dear
child
you
have
certainly
surpassed
anything
you
have
done
he
set
it
on
the
floor
propped
against
the
wall
and
leaned
back
to
squint
at
it
it
was
nice
to
be
praised
and
cynthia
felt
herself
getting
warm
and
pink
cheeked
yes
she
knew
nono
had
been
her
best
effort
to
date
there

be
better

little
editor

chapter
nancy
s
rapid
fluent
french
gave
directions
to
the
small
sabot
shod
boy
who
dragged
behind
him
a
blue
painted
hand
cart
then
she
turned
to
bestow
an
additional
hug
on
the
waiting
cynthia
oh
but
it
is
grand
to
see
you
and
how
brown
you
will
get
here
come
along
françois
ll
bring
your
luggage
in
his
cynthia
drew
a
deep
whiff
of
the
ocean
scented
air
ouff
s
nice
to
get
on
solid
ground
again
i
feel
inches
deep
in
train
dirt
and
trolley
dust
how
sweet
the
air
smells
you
ll
see
the
broad
atlantic
in
a
moment
or
two
just
over
that
way
a
few
blocks
we
have
to
walk
about
a
half
mile
to
the
bathing
beach
but
it
s
a
beauty
when
you
get
cynthia
gave
a
little
skip
of
delight
how
s
your
especially
nice
parent
she
asked
she
s
always
lovely
at
the
moment
she
s
in
a
seventh
heaven
having
donned
a
disreputable
smock
stuck
an
old
straw
hat
on
her
head
and
is
painting
ocean
foam
and
wet
rocks
laying
the
color
on
the
canvas
with
a
trowel
she
s
awfully
glad
to
be
free
of
the
illustration
business
for
a
time
if
you
ask
me
but
you
ll
see
her
soon
she
gets
hungry
and
comes
home
to
nancy
babbled
on
and
cynthia
had
a
chance
to
see
how
brown
and
strong
she
looked
how
much
good
the
summer
in
this
tiny
provincial
town
was
doing
her
we
turn
here
to
the
right
this
ladieeze
and
gen
lemen
is
the
main
and
principal
street
of
le
conquet
the
most
town
in
all
france
sweet
isn
t
it
cindy
it
was
cynthia
admitted
adorable
old
and
gray
and
cobblepaved
with
a
tiny
sidewalk
along
one
wall
and
with
little
and
houses
of
old
stone
whose
tiny
windows
opened
intimately
close
to
the
street
as
did
the
heavy
wooden
doors
green
lichened
roofs
sloped
steeply
and
there
were
red
geraniums
blooming
in
open
windows
between
blowing
red
and
green
checked
curtains
to
give
color
to
the
mellow
softness
of
the
ancient
stone
our
american
hero
jones
used
to
put
in
here
they
say
remarked
nancy
casually
what
jones
asked
cynthia
then
at
nancy
s
deepening
dimple
always
an
index
to
her
mood
suspected
a
trap
who
was
jones
why
surely
you
remember
john
jones
of
the
navy
no
not
john
jones
beast
laughed
cynthia
then
tell
me
some
well
as
you
know
this
is
the
department
of
finisterre
lands
end
and
is
the
farthest
west
of
all
western
provinces
some
centuries
ago
dunno
how
many
but
not
long
it
belonged
to
england
and
the
people
here
are
closer
to
the
type
than
you
could
they
turned
a
corner
past
a
wide
lipped
stone
well
where
a
woman
dipped
water
in
a
huge
pitcher
cynthia
murmured
wait
till
i
can
get
to
my
sketch
book
and
nancy
nodded
understandingly
then
the
french
got
it
back
she
continued
and
perhaps
the
english
again
after
that
anyway
the
english
burnt
it
a
couple
of
times
though
there
were
still
some
english
families
living
here
but
spared
the
houses
in
which
they
lived
that
s
why
there
are
still
some
very
old
places
in
spite
of
the
conquerors
here
s
the
quay
you
must
get
out
your
canvas
sneakers
these
cobbles
are
death
on
good
leather
shoes
wooden
sabots
are
best
though
i
ve
never
tried
the
tiny
hotel
smelled
pleasantly
of
soap
and
good
breton
cooking
one
went
steeply
up
two
flights
of
stairs
to
a
narrow
hall
and
turned
into
a
small
whitewashed
room
with
a
dresser
a
wash
stand
and
a
white
covered
bed
the
single
window
overlooked
the
long
stretch
of
quay
and
the
tidal
river
very
low
now
and
turning
to
marvelous
lavender
in
the
sunset
light
my
room
is
next
door
and
mother
s
beyond
that
here
are
your
things
i
brought
you
the
longest
way
so
you
could
see
the
town
goodness
you
aren
t
catching
a
cold
are
you
cynthia
sneezed
again
i
hope
not
but
a
small
child
in
the
train
from
paris
had
frightful
snuffles
right
in
my
own
compartment
and
it
was
sort
of
drafty
on
the
trolley
from
promising
to
hurry
she
closed
the
door
and
went
to
the
window
to
hang
out
gazing
wooden
shoes
clattered
merrily
on
the
cobbles
of
the
quay
and
along
the
distant
dunes
purpling
with
dusk
smoke
rose
from
the
smouldering
potash
fires
where
nancy
had
said
the
thrifty
bretons
burned
seaweed
for
fertilizer
she
was
pleasantly
weary
and
very
hungry
all
last
night
she
had
been
traveling
more
than
half
the
width
of
france
from
paris
to
brest
uncle
leslie
had
sailed
from
brest
after
the
armistice
she
remembered
and
its
steep
streets
and
ancient
houses
built
on
half
a
dozen
different
levels
had
fascinated
her
during
the
hours
she
had
to
wait
for
her
trolley
to
le
conquet
it
had
been
surprisingly
hard
to
leave
paris
that
city
had
changed
for
her
almost
overnight
she
could
have
stayed
on
there
almost
happily
doing
paintings
and
more
paintings
digging
herself
in
happily
but
not
quite
after
all
she
could
have
done
that
in
new
york
and
what
was
the
use
of
keeping
on
with
a
thing
once
you
had
learned
you
could
really
do
it
once
you
had
met
it
and
conquered
it
while
she
was
over
here
it
was
up
to
her
to
travel
learn
experiment
grow
and
here
right
outside
the
window
was
her
first
view
of
a
real
french
village
how
different
from
paris
how
quaint
and
sweet
and
clean
and
oh
how
paintable
it
was
going
to
be
no
wonder
nancy
s
famous
artist
mother
planned
to
spend
her
summer
here
perhaps
brewster
would
be
able
to
tell
her
how
to
find
a
model
for
the
next
cover
the
christmas
number
of
one
s
cynthia
wanted
to
paint
a
little
dark
eyed
breton
girl
or
boy
in
wooden
shoes
and
quaint
cap
for
that
december
number
goodness
there
was
the
dinner
gong
cynthia
pulled
in
her
head
just
in
time
to
face
nancy
at
the
door
mother
just
came
up
stairs
want
to
come
say
hello
cynthia
sneezed
and
fumbled
in
her
suitcase
for
a
clean
handkerchief
just
a
moment
nan
i
ve
been
so
busy
just
looking
that
i
haven
t
had
time
to
get
washed
or
combed
now
where
did
i
put
those
hankies
pour
out
the
water
will
you
honey
so
i
can
oh
darling
brewster
nancy
s
mother
as
pretty
as
ever
tanned
from
sea
bathing
seemed
hardly
older
than
her
daughter
we
re
so
glad
to
have
you
here
my
child
i
want
to
hear
all
about
your
covers
and
see
what
you
ve
been
doing
nancy
tells
me
you
ve
already
completed
one
painting
in
paris
here
s
the
dining
room
and
this
is
our
there
were
several
painters
and
two
writers
among
the
jolly
little
crowd
at
the
hotel
des
poissons
cynthia
got
a
tremendous
thrill
out
of
having
these
older
people
all
professional
craftsmen
of
proved
ability
regard
her
with
respect
and
as
an
artist
already
yet
she
was
after
all
also
a
professional
traveling
actually
seeing
the
world
on
what
she
earned
with
her
brush
and
pencil
when
she
stopped
to
think
about
that
cynthia
always
felt
like
a
who
has
rubbed
the
magic
ring
but
generally
she
was
too
busy
to
think
about
it
the
next
morning
nancy
took
her
to
explore
the
little
town
not
a
long
tour
for
there
were
not
six
streets
in
the
whole
place
the
ancient
sturdy
houses
facing
the
sea
for
half
a
dozen
centuries
seemed
to
grow
from
the
very
rock
on
which
they
were
built
below
the
hotel
one
crossed
a
bridge
at
high
water
or
walked
on
a
raised
path
across
the
sands
at
low
tide
to
a
long
sandy
beach
bordered
with
dunes
and
tall
waving
grasses
very
white
and
flat
and
clean
cynthia
surveyed
the
clear
stretch
of
deserted
sand
and
nancy
s
brief
little
bathing
suit
with
a
longing
eye
i
won
t
go
swimming
for
a
day
or
two
i
guess
she
decided
this
cold
doesn
t
seem
to
get
any
better
and
i
d
rather
not
risk
she
wondered
if
she
were
being
fussy
about
herself
breakfast
was
a
delightfully
informal
meal
at
almost
any
hour
of
the
morning
and
in
the
inn
parlor
not
the
dining
room
here
the
ceiling
quivered
with
reflections
from
the
sunspangled
river
on
the
second
morning
nancy
brought
to
breakfast
a
large
mysterious
bag
and
when
she
had
received
her
huge
bowl
of
au
weak
coffee
made
with
milk
she
opened
the
paper
bag
and
dumped
a
handful
of
what
appeared
to
be
rolled
oats
raw
into
her
bowl
what
on
earth
is
that
asked
cynthia
that
s
my
breakfast
food
want
to
try
some
cynthia
shook
her
head
goodness
no
but
where
can
you
get
breakfast
food
american
style
in
a
paper
bag
in
a
french
village
feed
store
mumbled
nancy
around
her
large
spoonful
it
s
just
chicken
feed
bran
i
get
so
hungry
by
noon
with
these
continental
how
about
an
egg
was
cynthia
s
suggestion
soft
try
and
get
nancy
s
tone
was
amused
cynthia
struggled
with
the
pronounce
shortly
it
came
all
alone
on
a
small
dish
it
was
hot
so
it
must
have
been
in
hot
water
but
when
she
broke
it
ugh
it
s
completely
raw
they
simply
won
t
boil
it
any
longer
unless
you
want
a
twenty
minute
egg
like
a
rock
explained
nancy
it
s
one
of
the
unsolved
mysteries
of
the
french
cuisine
you
ll
come
to
yet
meanwhile
the
time
was
passing
cynthia
had
arrived
on
a
thursday
sunday
had
rolled
round
her
christmas
cover
must
go
off
to
paris
this
week
and
she
seemed
no
nearer
it
than
the
week
before
in
fact
so
far
she
hadn
t
seen
any
children
that
looked
paintable
they
are
pretty
enough
she
mourned
at
breakfast
on
sunday
but
it
s
merely
a
matter
of
color
with
them
i
haven
t
seen
a
single
child
that
i
thought
would
make
a
good
poster
brewster
nodded
i
know
but
some
of
the
old
people
are
marvelous
there
are
no
better
types
for
models
of
old
people
in
all
of
but
not
for
the
christmas
cover
of
a
children
s
magazine
unless
there
is
a
thought
i
give
them
a
breton
santa
no
whiskers
on
em
nancy
was
most
discouraging
what
have
you
to
suggest
mother
hark
there
s
the
church
bell
i
suggest
that
you
two
hurry
into
your
best
bonnets
and
shawls
and
go
to
church
all
the
village
will
be
there
and
you
will
have
a
good
chance
to
look
them
over
then
if
you
find
what
you
want
i
ll
ask
madame
our
patronne
to
introduce
us
hurry
now
it
was
a
splendid
idea
cynthia
admitted
as
she
followed
nancy
into
the
little
stone
church
surely
every
good
breton
inhabitant
of
le
conquet
was
present
the
women
in
wide
skirts
trimmed
with
bands
of
black
velvet
with
full
sleeves
and
tight
black
bodices
setting
off
the
white
aprons
the
frosty
white
caps
of
breton
lace
and
the
wide
lace
collars
here
at
least
all
the
lovely
quaintness
of
medieval
france
had
not
gone
down
before
the
stupid
uniform
of
gingham
dresses
the
men
were
no
less
picturesque
with
their
low
crowned
wide
brimmed
hats
the
shining
silver
buttons
on
their
short
black
velvet
coats
and
each
child
was
a
miniature
replica
of
its
parents
with
the
exception
of
the
caps
which
mark
the
married
women
the
small
bleak
church
was
warmed
to
light
by
the
rustle
of
many
garments
by
the
soft
glow
of
candles
and
cynthia
was
enchanted
by
the
little
that
swung
from
the
hand
hewn
rafters
all
of
them
as
perfect
as
skill
and
loving
care
could
make
them
they
are
thank
offerings
for
the
safe
return
of
the
ships
they
represent
nancy
whispered
to
her
oh
look
cindy
isn
t
she
a
darling
her
elbow
nudged
for
cynthia
s
attention
the
minute
cynthia
saw
her
her
artist
s
eye
registered
her
as
the
one
model
for
that
christmas
cover
such
eyes
such
soft
curls
around
the
little
face
such
a
dimpled
round
chin
above
the
starched
white
collar
and
the
tight
little
bodice
like
a
small
child
playing
at
cynthia
nodded
her
approval
of
nancy
s
choice
how
nice
she
thought
to
be
with
artists
again
oh
i
wish
they
could
be
with
me
all
over
france
remembering
her
loneliness
in
paris
after
the
service
they
edged
their
way
toward
the
door
cynthia
keeping
the
child
in
sight
all
the
way
the
little
girl
s
mother
who
walked
behind
her
was
a
larger
edition
of
the
same
type
and
must
have
been
lovely
when
she
was
young
but
was
now
bent
and
weary
eyed
like
so
many
of
the
hard
working
breton
peasants
nancy
s
eyes
had
been
roving
the
church
now
she
gave
cynthia
a
reassuring
nod
wait
for
me
outside
she
commanded
and
wriggled
away
through
the
crowd
cynthia
who
was
taller
than
most
of
the
villagers
saw
her
stop
at
last
before
a
woman
in
black
and
wearing
a
hat
their
own
patronne
from
the
hotel
very
much
in
her
sunday
best
nancy
waved
to
cynthia
then
the
two
disappeared
blotted
out
by
the
congregation
five
minutes
later
she
joined
cynthia
in
the
little
square
above
the
fountain
it
s
all
right
she
reported
triumphantly
we
identified
your
model
and
her
mother
and
madame
says
she
will
ask
her
about
that
was
fine
cynthia
already
saw
her
cover
painted
delivered
printed
and
exhibited
on
every
christmas
news
stand
in
new
york
she
drew
a
breath
of
relief
they
strolled
back
toward
the
hotel
and
the
pleasant
smell
of
sunday
dinner
the
crowd
slowly
trickling
away
behind
them
the
little
bakery
was
already
doing
a
brisk
business
for
many
of
these
small
shops
opened
as
soon
as
the
church
was
out
cynthia
s
eyes
caught
a
new
poster
on
the
bakery
wall
a
single
sheet
of
vivid
lemon
yellow
with
blue
and
red
type
such
a
bright
patch
of
color
in
the
pearly
gray
street
that
she
hauled
nancy
along
to
look
at
it
well
after
a
minute
of
nancy
s
silent
contemplation
what
does
it
say
stupid
can
t
you
read
out
loud
the
way
you
were
taught
nancy
chuckled
sorry
i
forgot
well
hypnotiste
means
i
gathered
as
much
as
that
what
comes
after
it
world
renowned
professor
that
sounds
spanish
but
he
says
he
s
from
paris
parisien
will
be
here
on
tuesday
evening
to
give
a
demonstration
of
his
stupendous
and
altogether
unexplainable
power
of
the
human
eye
nancy
translated
loosely
it
also
says
his
demonstration
will
be
held
in
the
meat
market
i
suppose
that
s
the
biggest
room
they
have
except
the
church
and
that
admission
will
be
one
and
two
francs
standing
room
fifty
centimes
poor
thing
he
can
t
make
much
of
a
living
out
of
let
s
go
suggested
cynthia
eh
well
then
as
the
idea
struck
her
i
think
it
would
be
fun
maybe
mother
would
like
to
go
let
s
ask
her
brewster
was
amused
at
the
idea
and
quite
willing
they
should
go
but
refused
to
be
a
third
of
the
party
not
if
it
s
to
be
held
in
the
meat
market
i
never
could
stand
the
odor
of
so
many
sides
of
beef
and
mutton
but
you
children
go
along
i
m
sure
you
will
find
it
an
amusing
cross
section
of
the
peasant
s
amusement
i
believe
they
have
never
had
a
hypnotist
here
but
cynthia
very
nearly
didn
t
get
to
the
entertainment
after
all
for
on
sunday
afternoon
she
went
swimming
with
nancy
it
was
an
hour
or
two
after
dinner
the
warmest
part
of
the
day
when
the
girls
took
their
bathing
suits
and
crossed
the
little
path
across
the
tidal
river
the
way
straggled
along
the
top
of
a
high
meadow
where
coarse
grasses
tangled
about
the
feet
and
where
on
the
rocks
below
the
sea
piled
churning
among
the
crevices
but
the
further
side
of
this
little
peninsula
was
the
bathing
beach
quite
wild
and
deserted
and
one
could
choose
any
of
a
hundred
sand
dunes
for
a
dressing
room
nancy
had
raced
on
ahead
and
cynthia
sneezed
twice
and
wondered
if
she
ought
to
go
for
this
swim
after
all
she
wrestled
with
her
conscience
for
a
bit
and
conscience
lost
it
was
a
beautiful
swim
but
about
midnight
cynthia
awoke
with
such
a
sore
throat
she
could
scarcely
whisper
oh
darn
she
murmured
feverishly
what
a
bother
i
do
hope
i
m
not
going
to
be
sick
she
lay
for
a
bit
thinking
about
that
then
rapped
gently
beside
her
bed
she
heard
nancy
s
springs
creak
heard
her
mutter
something
sleepily
and
in
a
moment
the
light
of
nancy
s
candle
appeared
beneath
the
crack
of
the
door
the
crack
widened
and
a
sleepy
voice
asked
did
you
rap
honey
oh
you
poor
thing
cynthia
you
are
a
wreck
brewster
was
called
immediately
and
then
madame
together
they
applied
a
hot
oily
cloth
to
cynthia
s
throbbing
throat
a
funny
aluminum
bottle
to
her
feet
and
gave
her
a
dose
of
something
else
equally
unpleasant
and
equally
hot
then
she
was
given
something
to
breathe
on
a
handkerchief
cynthia
muttered
that
it
nearly
blew
off
the
top
of
her
head
but
it
did
miraculously
clear
her
nose
for
its
original
purpose
of
breathing
next
day
she
felt
heaps
and
heaps
better
and
protested
that
she
could
easily
get
up
but
she
was
kept
in
bed
till
noon
and
then
allowed
out
only
for
a
short
stroll
in
the
sunshine
equipped
with
a
handkerchief
soaked
in
the
breathing
stuff
but
no
more
bathing
till
you
are
quite
over
this
was
the
stern
order
of
nancy
s
mother
yes
m
murmured
cynthia
meekly
ashamed
to
have
given
them
all
such
a
fright
there
was
however
a
final
straw
at
dinner
that
night
madame
reported
that
she
had
seen
the
mother
of
the
little
girl
leonie
her
name
was
and
that
the
woman
refused
to
let
the
child
pose
for
her
portrait
but
how
silly
stammered
cynthia
what
is
the
matter
i
ll
pay
for
her
time
of
it
s
not
that
brewster
explained
from
madame
s
conversation
but
they
are
rather
afraid
of
artists
the
few
who
come
here
paint
only
the
sea
and
the
dunes
they
aren
t
accustomed
to
the
idea
of
artists
models
not
even
for
portraits
this
woman
seems
unusually
simple
and
i
suppose
the
word
posing
made
her
think
of
wicked
paris
i
m
sorry
for
i
think
i
might
have
persuaded
her
madame
probably
didn
t
know
how
to
go
about
it
tactfully
if
the
woman
could
have
met
you
but
aren
t
there
others
you
can
get
i
m
sure
there
must
so
that
christmas
cover
had
gone
to
smash
too
it
would
be
hard
to
pick
out
another
child
after
having
seen
leonie
perhaps
she
d
have
another
opportunity
to
see
the
villagers
at
the
meeting
on
tuesday
evening
brewster
again
gave
her
reluctant
though
amused
consent
if
you
ll
take
a
fresh
handkerchief
with
some
of
that
breathex
on
it
three
of
em
promised
cynthia
and
nancy
together
and
come
straight
home
if
you
find
you
re
in
a
draft
or
if
you
start
to
we
will
came
the
chorus
brewster
laughed
all
right
and
i
may
sound
fussy
but
a
tiny
village
in
a
foreign
country
is
no
place
for
one
to
get
now
run
along
and
get
ready
for
your
they
followed
the
crowd
and
the
clomp
of
wooden
shoes
to
the
meat
market
at
the
center
of
the
town
here
in
the
big
hall
benches
rough
boards
on
trestles
had
been
arranged
and
the
professor
himself
stood
at
the
improvised
ticket
window
shall
we
be
extravagant
and
take
a
ticket
then
we
can
sit
in
the
front
row
suggested
nancy
let
s
urged
cynthia
what
fun
to
have
eight
cents
buy
so
much
the
first
two
rows
were
very
de
luxe
benches
with
backs
but
so
hard
and
narrow
that
cynthia
was
glad
they
had
brought
their
coats
for
cushions
the
children
giggling
and
whispering
somewhat
awestruck
by
the
promised
entertainment
crowded
into
the
seats
behind
them
and
in
the
front
rows
sat
the
old
ladies
some
even
with
their
knitting
very
straight
and
stiff
and
impressive
there
was
a
scuffle
of
sabots
on
the
stone
floor
and
outside
a
tied
sheep
plaintively
everyone
peered
and
craned
and
turned
heads
to
see
the
two
american
mademoiselles
and
discussed
them
in
friendly
fashion
but
quite
openly
cynthia
s
bright
beret
and
red
coat
her
gray
eyes
and
dark
curls
her
shoes
her
silk
stockings
the
ring
on
her
finger
were
argued
and
debated
and
relayed
by
nancy
in
a
choked
murmur
you
are
rich
since
you
wear
a
gold
ring
with
a
greenglass
stone
in
it
someone
suggests
that
you
are
married
also
because
of
the
ring
but
it
seems
madame
at
the
hotel
has
reported
that
you
are
still
a
mees
judging
by
your
letters
oh
here
is
our
professor
m
sieu
reynaldo
who
had
been
at
once
ticket
taker
and
dispenser
usher
and
of
small
boys
who
would
press
their
snubby
noses
against
the
windows
at
last
barred
the
doors
and
strode
proudly
up
the
center
and
only
aisle
the
stage
was
a
rough
platform
on
beneath
the
light
of
a
half
dozen
dim
swinging
lanterns
and
was
but
a
few
feet
from
the
de
luxe
seats
occupied
by
cynthia
and
nancy
look
nancy
there
s
my
lost
model
leonie
see
there
at
the
end
isn
t
she
a
darling
nancy
nudged
her
he
s
going
to
the
professor
s
performance
began
with
a
short
talk
on
hypnotism
its
great
antiquity
its
meaning
and
mostly
of
how
wonderful
he
was
at
that
ancient
art
how
with
the
supreme
power
of
his
eye
and
a
few
passes
of
his
hands
somewhat
soiled
hands
they
were
he
could
control
his
subjects
and
command
them
thereafter
to
do
his
bidding
i
don
t
believe
it
murmured
cynthia
wait
and
see
muttered
nancy
i
must
have
absolute
quiet
here
during
my
demonstrations
frowned
the
great
reynaldo
he
was
a
small
man
in
a
soiled
velvet
jacket
and
the
jetty
hair
the
low
brows
the
wide
cheekbones
of
the
typical
lower
class
parisien
an
amusing
contrast
to
the
bigger
blonder
breton
audience
he
asked
first
for
two
volunteers
from
the
audience
after
considerable
shy
shuffling
of
feet
and
chattering
insistence
on
the
part
of
their
feminine
escorts
two
boys
were
shoved
forward
down
the
aisle
laughing
red
with
embarrassment
the
clumsy
young
fishermen
mounted
the
stage
then
half
numb
with
stage
fright
awaited
the
next
move
a
chorus
of
murmured
advice
came
from
the
interested
and
neighborly
audience
silence
ordered
the
professor
with
a
flash
of
his
eyes
then
before
the
eyes
of
each
volunteer
he
made
passes
with
his
hand
gave
a
low
murmured
command
and
first
one
then
the
other
became
glassy
eyed
and
appeared
to
go
into
a
waking
sleep
there
on
the
stage
the
hall
was
intensely
still
hardly
a
foot
stirred
or
a
skirt
rustled
cynthia
choked
in
her
handkerchief
oh
dear
she
thought
i
believe
i
m
going
to
sneeze
and
how
shall
we
ever
get
out
of
here
but
the
scent
on
her
handkerchief
though
it
nearly
strangled
her
did
put
a
halt
to
the
sneeze
you
are
now
asleep
the
professor
told
his
subjects
you
will
do
exactly
as
i
say
lie
down
and
roll
the
two
young
men
lay
down
on
the
platform
and
rolled
over
there
was
a
murmur
of
awe
from
the
onlookers
now
this
is
a
stairway
and
you
are
climbing
up
it
continued
the
orders
now
open
this
door
where
there
was
no
door
it
is
cold
and
windy
out
and
the
rain
beats
on
your
faces
as
you
open
the
two
staggered
back
arms
over
eyes
as
though
they
had
indeed
opened
a
real
door
on
a
blast
of
wind
and
rain
cynthia
was
getting
a
little
bored
with
this
it
seemed
so
onesided
so
unsporting
the
audience
tittered
but
the
boys
were
such
simple
country
lads
it
seemed
unfair
they
should
be
made
a
laughing
stock
like
this
she
didn
t
like
that
oily
little
man
with
his
velvet
coat
and
his
soiled
hands
i
wish
he
d
stop
she
thought
the
exhibition
continued
with
various
orders
the
subjects
were
given
water
to
taste
an
empty
glass
to
smell
but
the
professor
directed
that
they
smell
or
taste
whatever
he
dictated
and
their
faces
amusingly
registered
disgust
or
delight
or
surprise
yes
they
were
funny
but
cynthia
felt
uncomfortable
and
looked
back
over
her
shoulder
toward
the
bolted
door
she
wished
she
hadn
t
come
only
once
did
the
little
professor
nearly
lose
his
subjects
during
a
tense
and
silent
moment
the
sheep
in
the
yard
uttered
a
prolonged
the
audience
giggled
hysterically
and
one
of
the
young
men
began
to
come
to
himself
again
looked
around
in
a
bewildered
fashion
and
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
platform
the
professor
waved
his
hands
snapped
his
fingers
go
it
is
finished
he
commanded
the
two
subjects
blinked
awake
if
they
had
been
caught
abroad
in
their
nightshirts
they
could
not
have
looked
more
red
and
sheepish
after
that
the
renowned
reynaldo
attempted
to
hypnotize
a
small
dog
a
little
fox
terrier
that
belonged
to
someone
in
the
audience
the
effort
was
hardly
a
success
for
the
fox
terrier
didn
t
seem
to
realize
he
was
a
subject
for
the
professor
s
art
but
the
audience
with
the
remembrance
of
the
former
demonstration
was
properly
impressed
and
after
a
bit
the
terrier
was
allowed
to
go
barking
his
joy
at
the
release
unharmed
to
his
master
again
the
paris
professor
called
for
volunteers
asking
this
time
for
two
little
girls
as
he
had
already
demonstrated
his
power
over
grown
men
the
children
on
the
benches
behind
cynthia
and
nancy
giggled
and
nudged
you
go
no
you
go
let
m
rie
go
let
leonie
till
five
had
been
suggested
and
the
professor
making
his
choice
called
two
to
the
stage
oh
there
goes
my
little
model
murmured
cynthia
really
distressed
can
t
we
stop
her
nancy
nancy
shook
her
head
her
eyes
on
the
stage
i
don
t
know
how
we
could
after
all
the
professor
is
french
and
we
are
just
outsiders
better
let
them
handle
it
cynthia
subsided
meekly
but
kept
an
eye
on
the
little
leonie
what
a
lovely
pose
and
that
one
and
the
next
why
the
child
was
a
born
model
a
picture
in
herself
she
was
also
excellent
material
for
the
hypnotist
for
she
immediately
obeyed
his
orders
going
to
sleep
bolt
upright
in
her
chair
before
the
professor
s
waving
commanding
hands
the
other
little
girl
older
and
of
stouter
stuff
though
not
so
easy
a
victim
was
also
finally
put
to
sleep
to
cynthia
s
relief
reynaldo
used
more
discretion
in
this
case
and
satisfied
his
audience
by
having
the
children
do
a
little
dance
by
having
them
appear
to
smell
a
rose
when
he
gave
them
an
onion
seem
to
taste
something
sour
when
he
gave
them
a
bonbon
then
he
asked
if
either
of
the
girls
were
musical
someone
in
the
audience
volunteered
that
marie
could
sing
but
that
leonie
could
not
sing
a
note
he
then
commanded
leonie
to
come
forward
and
perform
for
them
sing
correctly
he
ordered
and
named
a
little
nursery
tune
known
to
all
french
children
the
child
really
had
a
very
pretty
voice
and
performed
with
considerable
credit
also
her
friends
seemed
to
think
it
marvelous
that
she
could
sing
at
all
but
cynthia
stifling
a
sneeze
in
her
handkerchief
tapped
a
restless
foot
on
the
stone
floor
good
it
was
going
to
end
monsieur
reynaldo
had
commanded
with
a
sharp
clap
of
his
hand
beside
the
ear
of
each
child
that
his
subjects
come
awake
m
rie
blinked
her
china
blue
eyes
smiled
timorously
and
clattered
down
the
steps
to
join
her
friends
but
leonie
was
a
different
matter
as
cynthia
taking
a
deep
breath
of
her
breathex
soaked
handkerchief
watched
with
some
interest
then
growing
apprehension
it
seemed
that
the
professor
also
was
becoming
concerned
to
cover
his
own
confusion
he
ordered
her
to
get
up
to
walk
across
the
stage
to
do
various
things
all
of
which
she
performed
with
her
former
obedience
but
when
he
again
made
passes
before
her
eyes
then
in
a
low
tone
to
cover
possible
failure
again
ordered
her
to
waken
she
remained
as
soundly
as
asleep
as
before
the
audience
was
apparently
undisturbed
and
seemed
to
take
all
this
as
part
of
the
performance
i
m
worried
cynthia
confided
to
nancy
through
the
muffling
folds
of
her
handkerchief
oh
but
this
stuff
is
her
eyes
were
streaming
with
tears
but
so
far
she
had
managed
to
keep
back
that
sneeze
worried
nancy
turned
big
eyes
on
cynthia
do
you
mean
to
say
i
don
t
think
he
can
get
that
child
out
of
that
trance
i
wonder
cynthia
turned
to
look
around
the
audience
they
too
were
beginning
unconsciously
to
reflect
the
professor
s
concern
quietly
three
times
now
he
had
given
his
command
cynthia
s
ears
were
abnormally
keen
in
spite
of
the
cold
she
glanced
back
again
at
the
stage
then
decided
what
she
would
do
evading
nancy
she
slipped
out
of
her
seat
past
the
two
old
ladies
who
sat
on
the
aisle
it
was
just
a
step
to
the
stage
a
step
or
two
across
it
leonie
s
blank
stare
did
not
turn
to
follow
her
but
cynthia
knew
that
she
had
the
attention
of
every
other
soul
in
the
house
she
smiled
briefly
at
the
bewildered
professor
and
crossed
to
the
child
from
her
pocket
she
drew
a
clean
handkerchief
soaked
with
the
scent
of
i
wonder
cynthia
spoke
in
english
in
the
hope
that
the
professor
being
from
paris
knew
a
little
of
that
tongue
if
the
would
like
to
smell
and
before
the
hypnotist
could
protest
had
clapped
the
handkerchief
to
leonie
s
little
snub
nose
it
was
like
a
double
dose
of
smelling
salts
the
american
makers
would
have
been
proud
of
their
preparation
though
perhaps
no
such
strange
application
of
it
had
ever
been
suggested
to
them
leonie
choked
coughed
strangled
a
moment
but
the
blank
left
her
eyes
and
she
struggled
to
escape
the
handkerchief
bewildered
for
a
moment
she
gazed
at
cynthia
then
smiled
shyly
in
a
perfectly
human
understanding
fashion
tactfully
cynthia
withdrew
merci
professor
she
murmured
and
backed
down
the
steps
she
heard
little
of
what
followed
the
professor
s
florid
explanation
of
this
occurrence
of
the
american
s
interference
with
his
demonstration
but
his
willingness
to
let
that
pass
and
so
on
and
so
on
the
audience
murmured
polite
amazement
stared
at
cynthia
clapped
at
the
end
of
reynaldo
s
speech
and
began
to
rise
from
their
benches
the
door
swung
open
into
the
sweet
starlit
night
well
stated
nancy
you
certainly
distinguished
yourself
gosh
but
that
was
a
close
call
for
leonie
wonder
what
would
have
happened
cynthia
shook
her
head
but
i
knew
something
must
happen
if
she
got
a
whiff
of
this
it
would
have
pulled
a
mummy
back
to
life
ah
here
s
the
child
s
mother
had
appeared
beside
her
holding
her
hand
she
at
least
was
not
unaware
that
the
american
mees
had
done
something
though
she
wasn
t
quite
sure
what
for
her
petite
thank
you
she
murmured
in
shy
halting
english
then
that
proving
to
be
all
she
knew
she
broke
into
fluid
french
which
almost
stumped
nancy
to
translate
she
asks
interpreted
miss
brewster
if
there
is
anything
she
can
do
for
the
pretty
american
make
a
bow
cindy
she
says
she
is
very
grateful
to
you
and
that
it
was
very
naughty
for
her
leonie
to
go
up
on
the
stage
like
that
before
all
the
village
i
ve
told
her
that
we
will
come
tomorrow
to
pay
our
respects
to
leonie
s
household
we
ll
bring
mother
along
too
that
all
sounds
sufficiently
they
streamed
out
into
the
fan
of
light
across
the
cobbled
road
the
white
caps
and
dark
dresses
of
the
audience
melted
behind
them
into
darkness
the
night
was
sweet
and
warm
and
there
was
a
sound
of
the
sea
on
the
rocks
far
off
good
night
called
cynthia
good
night
then
slipped
her
hand
into
nancy
s
arm
there
said
nancy
is
your
christmas
cover
my
dear
and
in
such
a
funny
sneezed
cynthia
in
eloquent
reply
chapter
little
miss
nancy
s
mother
who
as
a
young
art
student
had
lived
in
france
knew
all
the
places
that
cynthia
as
a
younger
art
student
ought
to
see
and
go
don
t
she
told
cynthia
despise
the
routes
just
because
they
are
later
on
you
can
go
to
the
out
of
the
way
places
too
but
you
need
the
places
as
a
basis
for
comparison
just
as
you
need
to
know
black
and
white
in
order
to
paint
the
idea
interested
cynthia
what
do
you
call
the
mother
means
those
that
are
full
of
tourists
and
trippers
explained
nancy
yes
of
course
said
brewster
just
the
sort
of
places
you
saw
in
paris
the
louvre
the
tomb
of
napoleon
montmartre
the
arc
de
triomphe
you
don
t
need
to
rush
through
them
baedecker
in
hand
though
a
guidebook
is
always
useful
like
the
american
couple
out
of
punch
you
see
the
outside
marthy
and
i
ll
see
the
inside
and
we
ll
cut
the
time
in
cynthia
laughed
she
knew
those
tourists
so
intent
on
gathering
data
to
relate
at
home
that
they
were
blind
to
real
beauty
to
all
the
little
local
color
and
pleasant
customs
of
the
people
but
besides
paris
what
would
you
suggest
well
there
s
carcassonne
of
oh
agreed
cynthia
carcassonne
had
been
on
her
list
too
then
i
think
you
should
see
a
bit
of
the
basque
country
it
s
lovely
though
it
has
become
a
little
lately
with
so
many
books
being
written
about
nancy
had
a
suggestion
here
don
t
you
think
cynthia
would
adore
mouleon
soule
and
brewster
agreeing
had
promised
a
letter
of
introduction
to
an
old
basque
artist
there
and
that
will
be
real
local
color
too
then
there
s
rome
and
venice
and
florence
cynthia
shook
her
head
not
much
chance
of
her
getting
to
italy
not
unless
the
reward
for
capturing
goncourt
on
the
ship
coming
over
should
materialize
tell
me
some
places
near
here
normandy
mont
michel
cried
nancy
brewster
nodded
i
wonder
she
began
nancy
took
her
up
if
we
couldn
t
go
too
oh
that
would
be
wonderful
cried
cynthia
and
so
the
matter
was
arranged
mont
michel
was
famous
for
four
things
its
tides
and
the
island
with
its
mile
long
causeway
to
land
its
fortress
abbey
and
omelets
nature
was
responsible
for
the
first
two
normandy
abbots
and
the
wealth
which
william
of
normandy
had
filched
from
england
for
the
second
and
madame
poulard
now
dead
but
still
surviving
in
her
reputation
for
the
third
it
was
to
partake
of
the
third
that
cynthia
was
seated
on
the
evening
of
her
first
day
at
mont
michel
before
a
red
checked
cloth
covered
table
in
the
hotel
tete
d
or
it
was
a
distracting
scent
the
great
arched
room
with
ceiling
darkened
by
the
smoke
of
many
fires
the
enormous
fireplace
under
the
great
cowled
chimney
and
the
fascinating
process
of
mixing
that
omelet
which
madame
poulard
had
made
famous
among
gourmets
all
the
world
over
and
for
a
further
distraction
there
was
the
couple
at
the
corner
table
the
man
so
dark
and
slim
and
well
interesting
looking
the
girl
so
pretty
and
so
angry
cynthia
s
attention
was
doubly
held
by
the
girl
s
prettiness
and
by
her
anger
nancy
s
tug
at
her
sleeve
pulled
cynthia
s
attention
back
to
the
omelet
making
this
was
a
ceremony
a
rite
in
itself
that
people
came
from
all
over
the
world
to
see
a
huge
bowl
of
sweet
butter
eggs
and
the
long
handled
iron
skillet
held
in
madam
s
skillful
hand
from
the
butter
she
sliced
a
great
golden
gob
dumped
it
into
the
pan
and
held
it
over
the
small
fire
in
the
big
fireplace
i
knew
the
original
madam
poulard
brewster
was
saying
she
and
her
husband
were
the
handsomest
couple
in
normandy
or
so
it
was
said
look
the
eggs
go
in
the
little
cook
plump
and
trim
in
her
black
dress
and
neat
white
apron
poured
the
golden
mass
into
the
hot
butter
stirred
it
slowly
with
a
long
handled
spoon
funny
to
think
how
small
a
thing
like
an
omelet
can
make
a
place
famous
mused
cynthia
oh
but
she
made
it
an
art
like
your
child
portraits
cynthia
said
brewster
a
delicious
smell
wood
smoke
butter
the
omelet
cynthia
grew
ravenous
just
watching
the
process
in
another
moment
it
would
be
ready
for
them
and
again
her
attention
sought
the
couple
at
the
further
table
the
man
looked
almost
french
thin
and
wiry
and
intense
the
girl
had
buttercup
hair
that
gleamed
in
the
lamplight
and
slim
capable
hands
with
which
she
gestured
as
she
talked
the
finished
omelet
was
served
piping
hot
upon
a
plate
warmed
before
the
fire
when
cynthia
had
finished
the
last
delicious
morsel
she
looked
up
again
the
party
of
two
had
become
three
by
the
addition
of
an
older
man
obviously
the
father
of
the
girl
i
wonder
if
they
re
engaged
said
cynthia
turning
the
little
emerald
on
her
own
slim
finger
who
s
engaged
cyn
asked
nancy
listen
honey
try
the
raspberries
with
sour
cream
they
re
but
then
nancy
s
back
was
toward
the
interesting
couple
so
she
might
be
excused
for
a
lack
of
interest
brewster
caught
cynthia
s
eye
and
smiled
the
man
looks
like
a
basque
she
said
but
i
think
the
girl
is
american
i
saw
them
in
our
hotel
this
the
brewsters
who
with
cynthia
had
come
the
short
but
complicated
trip
from
brittany
that
morning
planned
now
to
spend
several
days
at
mont
michel
after
that
cynthia
was
reconciled
to
traveling
alone
again
meanwhile
she
and
nancy
could
paint
and
explore
the
abbey
fortress
and
talk
academy
gossip
there
wouldn
t
be
such
another
chance
till
cynthia
got
back
to
new
york
exploration
got
under
way
immediately
after
breakfast
the
next
morning
nancy
with
her
mother
s
sketch
box
cynthia
with
the
sketching
stool
accompanied
brewster
up
the
steep
cobbled
street
of
the
tiny
village
just
as
far
as
half
way
up
the
hill
directed
brewster
there
s
a
small
garden
of
cabbages
there
that
takes
on
the
most
heavenly
color
in
the
sunlight
that
is
if
the
man
has
planted
cabbages
this
the
man
had
and
they
were
indeed
heavenly
cynthia
sucked
in
her
breath
at
the
beauty
of
the
color
one
had
not
guessed
that
mere
cabbages
could
be
so
decorative
below
them
stretched
stairs
and
more
stairs
of
the
dark
purplish
brown
stone
of
the
island
all
the
long
steep
curving
way
up
which
they
had
come
slowly
the
stairway
had
widened
houses
dropped
away
and
now
level
with
the
eye
rose
the
second
and
third
stories
of
the
dwellings
that
fringed
the
town
chimneys
incredibly
thick
threw
long
morning
shadows
of
rich
blue
on
salmon
pink
walls
and
grey
tiled
roofs
round
towers
lent
piquant
variety
to
the
outlines
and
the
incongruity
of
a
bedquilt
stuffed
through
the
window
of
a
beetling
fortress
to
air
above
a
frowning
keep
made
cynthia
s
fingers
tingle
for
paper
and
pencil
with
which
to
note
it
all
down
below
the
windows
tiny
gardens
something
pinkish
something
ochre
cynthia
with
eyes
half
closed
to
shut
out
shapes
of
things
saw
only
color
where
some
thrifty
normandy
farmer
had
planted
provender
for
the
coming
winter
and
cabbages
so
green
they
were
almost
blue
jewel
vivid
jewel
bright
cynthia
nodded
tomorrow
she
would
bring
her
paint
box
my
stool
cynthia
amusedly
brewster
broke
in
on
her
reverie
i
ll
be
here
for
two
hours
at
least
run
along
and
don
t
fall
off
any
parapets
or
into
any
what
s
an
oubliette
asked
cynthia
racing
upward
beside
nancy
it
s
a
forgettery
explained
nancy
and
if
that
doesn
t
mean
anything
to
you
my
child
it
s
an
extremely
graphic
name
for
the
underground
dungeons
that
they
used
to
drop
you
into
if
you
offended
a
king
or
an
abbot
monte
cristo
stuff
you
know
i
believe
this
place
is
simply
riddled
with
ugh
horrid
people
kings
and
abbots
ah
but
they
could
build
look
up
honey
above
now
far
above
them
rose
the
peaks
and
pinnacles
of
this
place
below
them
the
whole
island
rose
like
a
hand
from
the
sea
joined
to
the
mainland
by
only
the
single
causeway
ringed
about
the
finger
s
root
were
the
far
off
houses
fronting
the
sea
backs
to
the
land
and
surmounting
the
whole
like
a
thimble
atop
the
finger
the
abbey
rising
ever
rising
in
the
still
clear
air
to
the
final
peak
of
all
the
glittering
image
of
saint
michel
de
la
mer
du
peril
of
the
perilous
sea
the
archangel
it
seemed
loved
heights
from
the
tip
of
the
tower
that
crowned
his
abbey
wings
of
gold
outspread
sword
uplifted
his
mailed
foot
crushed
the
devil
who
crawled
beneath
and
atop
one
foot
perched
the
golden
cock
symbol
of
eternal
vigilance
cynthia
gazing
skyward
murmured
lovely
marvelous
whispered
nancy
looking
seaward
the
sands
of
michel
those
treacherous
sands
through
which
the
tide
can
rip
and
roar
in
minutes
seconds
almost
shone
far
below
them
now
peacefully
dry
almost
lavender
in
the
sun
creating
a
false
horizon
for
the
fringe
of
little
houses
along
the
shore
let
s
get
a
guide
suggested
nancy
turning
back
i
detest
them
as
a
rule
but
this
place
is
a
perfect
labyrinth
and
besides
you
can
pick
up
so
much
information
the
guide
books
don
t
give
at
the
entrance
gate
where
a
few
francs
bought
admittance
they
found
that
a
group
would
start
through
the
abbey
in
about
twenty
minutes
preferring
to
wait
outside
they
braced
themselves
against
the
wall
where
the
sun
was
pleasantly
warm
and
watched
their
fellow
tourists
assemble
a
little
old
lady
and
her
husband
both
very
winded
from
the
long
climb
from
ioway
cynthia
bet
nancy
in
a
whisper
and
on
their
wedding
anniversary
heads
you
win
tails
i
lose
said
nancy
scornfully
but
these
are
britishers
i
ll
bet
my
new
tube
of
prussian
sober
hats
set
high
on
the
head
bright
complexions
and
as
they
drew
nearer
up
the
stair
broad
a
s
and
clipped
g
s
proved
nancy
to
be
right
next
three
french
sisters
in
black
and
white
from
some
religious
order
probably
from
a
convent
in
canada
hazarded
nancy
listening
to
their
french
they
come
on
holiday
to
visit
the
churches
in
france
mother
and
i
have
crossed
with
groups
of
them
several
times
they
are
always
so
picturesque
and
so
jolly
and
here
s
a
pretty
girl
for
your
sketch
book
it
was
the
girl
from
the
restaurant
the
girl
with
the
buttercup
hair
and
her
young
man
the
girl
seemed
to
half
recognize
cynthia
for
she
gave
a
little
tremulous
smile
then
turned
abruptly
away
as
though
she
wasn
t
sure
whether
they
had
met
or
not
et
began
the
guide
in
shrill
tones
and
fumbling
with
an
enormous
bunch
of
keys
unlocked
the
great
door
to
the
abbey
for
the
next
hour
he
led
them
through
cloisters
twelve
hundred
feet
above
the
ocean
through
the
refectory
and
the
ancient
church
through
banqueting
halls
in
which
kings
and
princes
had
feasted
they
say
harold
the
saxon
was
a
guest
and
a
prisoner
here
of
william
of
normandy
before
william
became
the
conqueror
translated
nancy
beyond
her
the
young
man
also
translated
for
the
benefit
of
the
girl
with
him
between
them
cynthia
managed
to
pick
up
most
of
the
guide
s
information
they
were
in
the
banqueting
hall
that
long
gray
drafty
hall
with
its
many
pillars
and
cynthia
gazing
about
her
tried
to
transform
it
to
the
way
it
must
have
been
when
harold
was
the
unwilling
guest
a
place
of
flaring
torches
lords
and
ladies
in
silks
and
velvets
in
trailing
veils
and
hennins
lifting
their
heavy
trains
from
the
rushes
that
covered
the
floor
there
would
be
tapestries
rippling
along
the
walls
as
the
drafts
caught
them
painted
ceilings
that
had
long
ago
faded
to
gray
and
stone
color
minstrels
to
make
music
great
dogs
to
lie
about
on
the
floor
and
the
delicious
scent
of
long
forgotten
foods
from
those
great
fireplaces
in
the
kitchens
beyond
yes
the
far
off
times
must
have
been
fun
too
she
wished
she
had
been
here
then
but
the
oubliettes
changed
her
opinion
on
that
only
a
few
of
them
so
the
guide
said
now
remained
open
to
the
public
the
others
cut
down
through
the
solid
rock
lay
far
far
below
damp
almost
airless
foul
with
rats
and
crawling
things
and
if
the
abbot
or
the
king
wanted
you
out
of
the
way
you
lived
for
years
down
there
said
nancy
one
not
far
below
the
dining
hall
was
a
tiny
place
dark
airless
with
scarcely
room
to
lie
or
sit
or
stand
upright
do
you
mean
to
say
asked
cynthia
that
those
people
up
above
could
dance
and
sing
and
and
enjoy
themselves
with
all
those
prisoners
down
below
them
the
group
had
gone
on
a
way
but
cynthia
lingering
behind
to
explore
had
jumped
down
into
the
oubliette
to
see
just
what
kind
of
a
place
it
really
was
she
spoke
from
the
floor
some
distance
below
nancy
s
neat
brown
oxfords
nancy
shrugged
that
s
the
middle
ages
cynthia
reached
up
give
me
a
hand
nancy
i
want
to
get
out
of
here
ugh
once
on
the
floor
beside
the
other
i
hate
this
place
it
s
haunted
by
all
those
horrible
things
they
used
to
nancy
looked
at
her
queerly
not
see
any
more
all
right
i
m
willing
and
five
minutes
later
they
stood
once
more
before
the
great
western
entrance
looking
out
over
the
sands
and
the
town
below
ou
uf
cynthia
drew
a
great
breath
of
the
free
air
i
d
go
off
my
nut
if
we
stayed
in
there
much
longer
it
s
beautiful
but
gosh
it
was
cruel
let
s
go
somewhere
and
pick
daisies
and
get
the
smell
of
those
forgetteries
out
of
our
noses
c
mon
and
grabbing
nancy
s
wrist
she
hauled
her
headlong
down
the
stairs
towards
the
town
below
as
they
raced
past
brewster
was
still
absorbed
in
her
cabbages
and
did
not
even
look
up
the
steps
narrowed
they
came
to
the
village
with
its
dark
tiny
windowed
houses
where
were
displayed
all
the
usual
tricks
to
catch
the
tourist
trade
daisies
cried
cynthia
where
can
we
get
daisies
and
looked
about
her
steep
cobbled
streets
the
sands
ahead
let
s
stop
and
get
us
a
citronade
and
i
ll
ask
suggested
the
diplomatic
nancy
while
they
sipped
the
sweet
warmish
drink
from
thick
tumblers
she
chattered
with
the
waitress
it
s
all
right
she
reported
there
are
pretty
flowers
for
you
to
pick
my
child
oh
there
s
your
blonde
friend
s
boy
friend
and
all
cynthia
had
noticed
him
too
furiously
striding
down
the
steep
street
where
was
the
buttercup
girl
they
were
quarreling
last
night
she
said
watching
the
nervous
wiry
back
as
it
turned
the
lower
corner
of
the
street
entered
the
hotel
and
then
her
father
came
in
she
didn
t
seem
very
happy
today
little
miss
teased
nancy
what
s
it
to
you
come
on
now
we
ll
go
hunt
at
the
very
foot
of
the
street
where
at
high
tide
the
seas
must
wash
where
boats
lay
small
and
deserted
on
the
yellow
sand
footprints
led
along
the
base
of
the
cliff
here
rounding
the
turn
the
wind
blew
freshly
from
off
the
coasts
of
england
small
crabs
scuttled
to
shelter
as
they
passed
and
far
far
above
them
saint
michel
dominated
his
devil
and
the
cock
eternally
crowed
above
them
suddenly
rose
steep
cliffs
covered
with
coarse
grass
and
if
not
daisies
at
least
their
french
cousins
no
houses
here
though
piles
of
rubble
and
a
bit
of
crumbled
wall
told
that
the
abbey
buildings
must
once
have
straggled
down
the
face
of
this
cliff
far
above
small
peasant
children
climbed
and
called
or
swung
bare
legs
from
an
outcrop
of
rock
and
still
higher
a
small
hunched
figure
sat
all
alone
on
a
rock
cynthia
was
about
to
say
oh
there
s
the
little
american
but
remembering
what
nancy
had
just
called
her
held
her
tongue
and
busied
herself
with
collecting
a
bouquet
for
brewster
s
room
presently
wearying
of
this
she
sat
on
a
stone
to
survey
the
steep
climb
she
had
already
come
and
the
sands
beyond
that
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
color
of
the
sand
had
changed
darkened
in
the
past
ten
minutes
idly
she
noted
that
the
children
had
gone
already
she
could
see
them
scampering
past
the
rock
at
the
base
saw
them
disappear
she
looked
back
of
her
nothing
here
no
connection
with
the
town
to
get
home
one
must
go
the
way
they
had
come
just
beyond
where
nancy
was
still
picking
flowers
was
the
american
girl
cynthia
s
gaze
took
her
in
with
the
rest
of
the
scene
suddenly
she
was
startled
almost
out
of
her
wits
by
a
small
figure
that
tore
past
her
yelling
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
was
still
more
startled
to
see
nancy
come
pelting
after
the
boy
marée
la
marée
montante
what
is
it
asked
cynthia
gazing
after
the
small
figure
that
had
passed
a
good
model
that
boy
would
be
with
his
wind
blown
curls
his
startled
eyes
nancy
grabbed
her
arm
shouted
in
her
ear
run
what
why
cynthia
s
feet
pounded
after
nancy
over
her
shoulder
nancy
flung
the
tide
he
said
the
tide
is
cynthia
looked
back
the
girl
behind
them
had
risen
from
her
rock
with
a
wrench
cynthia
freed
her
arm
from
nancy
s
grasp
put
hands
to
mouth
and
megaphoned
hurry
the
she
seemed
to
get
the
idea
for
immediately
she
came
leaping
down
over
the
rocks
cynthia
paused
only
once
to
glance
behind
and
see
what
good
speed
the
girl
was
making
then
raced
to
catch
up
with
nancy
almost
together
the
three
reached
the
sands
so
that
was
why
they
had
changed
so
rapidly
from
ochre
to
lavender
water
tidal
water
seeping
swiftly
menacingly
from
beneath
pouring
in
from
every
side
but
the
sand
at
the
base
of
the
rocks
was
still
dry
it
was
hardly
five
minutes
race
around
the
rocks
to
the
end
of
the
little
street
hearts
pounding
breath
sobbing
they
reached
it
together
cynthia
could
not
stop
there
she
wanted
to
reach
her
hotel
her
room
feel
safe
ground
familiar
ground
that
could
not
dissolve
into
seas
beneath
her
feet
before
she
stopped
as
she
tore
through
the
hallway
passed
the
astonished
eyes
of
madame
at
the
desk
nancy
was
close
behind
together
they
dragged
the
little
american
in
with
them
slumped
together
on
the
two
beds
well
gasped
cynthia
nancy
echoed
her
my
good
gosh
cynthia
that
was
a
close
call
the
buttercup
girl
rose
first
stood
for
a
long
moment
at
the
window
looking
out
look
here
she
said
at
last
seemed
to
have
trouble
with
her
voice
and
spoke
again
come
here
you
it
was
the
first
they
had
heard
her
speak
cynthia
who
had
by
now
slightly
recovered
her
breath
felt
that
her
knees
would
bear
her
again
but
when
she
looked
out
she
nearly
lost
what
breath
she
had
gained
nancy
oh
from
base
of
rock
to
farthest
horizon
the
sea
rushed
tumbling
foaming
stealthily
rising
rising
ten
minutes
later
and
they
would
have
been
engulfed
in
it
even
five
minutes
later
and
the
quicksands
forerunner
of
the
rush
of
waves
would
have
caught
them
they
say
it
rises
sixteen
feet
every
nancy
s
voice
was
shaking
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
was
the
entrance
of
brewster
having
heard
madame
s
story
at
the
desk
she
immediately
took
cheerful
charge
of
the
situation
we
ll
have
lunch
here
in
the
room
she
suggested
i
ll
order
anything
you
like
and
then
all
three
of
you
had
better
lie
down
for
an
hour
this
is
miss
comstock
betsey
comstock
murmured
the
buttercup
girl
cynthia
endeavoring
to
follow
brewster
s
cheerful
lead
asked
if
the
hotel
couldn
t
serve
some
snails
she
had
heard
they
were
good
and
she
said
she
felt
in
a
mood
to
experiment
actually
not
even
snails
for
lunch
seem
very
reckless
after
their
recent
experience
betsey
still
seemed
a
little
dazed
but
nancy
had
several
wildly
fantastic
suggestions
and
brewster
rang
for
the
waiter
ordered
lunch
to
be
brought
to
their
room
they
had
scarcely
sat
down
to
eat
when
a
knock
sounded
imperatively
on
the
door
as
brewster
answered
it
cynthia
saw
beyond
her
shoulder
a
man
s
face
distraught
and
white
oh
madame
he
cried
is
miss
i
was
told
that
is
robert
betsey
comstock
had
rushed
past
brewster
and
flung
herself
into
the
young
man
s
arms
smiling
brewster
discreetly
closed
the
door
but
murmurs
and
soft
voices
as
though
in
reconciliation
sounded
beyond
it
the
girls
were
half
way
through
lunch
when
betsey
such
a
changed
betsey
all
smiles
and
radiance
reappeared
apologies
please
she
begged
charmingly
robert
had
a
luncheon
engagement
with
a
man
he
met
here
at
the
hotel
an
architect
so
i
did
not
ask
him
in
but
the
rest
i
d
like
to
to
cynthia
it
sounded
very
romantic
a
young
basque
yberri
was
the
name
educated
in
america
for
his
career
of
architecture
and
betsey
now
engaged
to
be
married
to
him
with
her
own
career
as
a
costume
designer
what
could
be
nicer
who
do
you
work
for
asked
the
practical
nancy
have
you
sold
anything
yet
i
had
my
first
act
in
cochran
s
revue
the
recent
one
in
oh
moms
and
i
saw
that
did
you
see
the
lovely
ballet
with
the
chinese
pagodas
on
their
heads
betsey
flushed
a
little
and
smiled
that
one
was
mine
cynthia
she
s
good
nancy
turned
enthusiastically
to
the
others
the
stuff
was
swell
betsey
continued
they
were
to
be
married
next
week
in
paris
and
return
to
the
states
dad
and
robert
and
she
betsey
had
letters
of
introduction
to
two
or
three
big
theatrical
producers
in
new
york
and
promise
of
further
work
with
cochran
grand
applauded
nancy
but
the
trouble
it
seemed
was
this
robert
didn
t
want
his
wife
to
continue
her
work
after
they
were
married
oh
dear
murmured
cynthia
just
suppose
chick
didn
t
want
her
to
keep
on
with
her
covers
but
then
chick
was
an
artist
also
he
understood
stop
your
painting
asked
nancy
puzzled
to
understand
anyone
in
a
family
that
didn
t
design
or
illustrate
or
paint
oh
no
he
s
willing
i
should
keep
on
with
the
designing
but
not
willing
i
should
earn
money
with
which
explained
their
quarrel
at
the
table
last
night
explained
why
betsey
had
gone
off
today
by
herself
on
the
rocks
but
now
it
s
all
right
isn
t
it
asked
cynthia
betsey
s
smile
became
somewhat
less
bright
no
o
she
admitted
we
made
it
up
the
quarrel
i
mean
but
nothing
is
decided
nothing
it
ll
work
out
somehow
consoled
cynthia
just
see
if
it
doesn
betsey
of
the
buttercup
hair
was
still
on
her
mind
next
morning
nancy
had
volunteered
to
go
on
a
hunt
for
the
small
boy
of
the
hill
the
one
who
had
warned
them
of
the
tide
cynthia
had
an
idea
that
he
would
make
a
good
model
for
her
next
magazine
cover
she
herself
was
sharing
the
privilege
of
the
cabbage
patch
and
the
shade
of
the
parapet
with
brewster
both
painting
busily
when
betsey
s
voice
sounded
slightly
above
cynthia
s
right
ear
s
good
murmured
the
voice
cynthia
looked
up
hi
she
said
around
the
paintbrush
in
her
mouth
but
her
gaze
wandered
back
to
the
sunny
ochre
of
the
sands
and
the
of
the
cabbages
difficult
to
depict
sunlight
against
that
false
horizon
you
need
blue
sky
to
make
a
landscape
look
sunny
i
m
going
up
to
the
abbey
whispered
betsey
with
an
eye
on
brewster
busily
painting
along
the
wall
stop
on
the
way
back
and
don
t
fall
into
any
but
after
she
had
gone
cynthia
still
worried
about
her
it
was
all
mixed
up
with
the
hue
of
cabbages
in
sunlight
why
was
betsey
alone
had
they
quarreled
again
if
that
robert
yberri
had
any
sense
he
d
let
her
keep
on
with
her
work
oh
glory
did
you
get
the
color
of
that
shadow
cynthia
took
a
peek
at
brewster
s
oil
sketch
almost
groaned
at
the
comparison
but
mixed
a
tiny
drop
of
rose
madder
with
her
wash
and
cocked
her
head
on
one
side
perhaps
that
was
it
an
hour
later
she
put
the
last
touch
on
it
yawned
stretched
and
looked
up
brewster
had
tactfully
stolen
away
below
the
fortress
wall
the
sands
were
slowly
darkening
into
lavender
as
they
had
yesterday
and
the
shadow
of
the
wall
no
longer
gave
her
shelter
time
to
pack
up
and
go
home
but
with
her
paints
packed
her
box
strapped
neatly
she
perched
on
the
wall
to
watch
again
that
relentless
tide
first
the
darkening
of
the
sand
one
could
not
say
at
just
what
instant
the
lavender
began
to
gleam
with
moisture
at
what
precise
second
one
noted
water
seeping
into
this
hollow
and
that
at
what
tick
of
the
watch
the
hollows
joined
ran
into
each
other
became
larger
ran
into
a
hundred
thin
continuous
streams
across
the
wide
expanse
of
sand
someone
was
coming
up
the
steps
a
man
with
thick
brown
hair
uncovered
with
american
plus
fours
miss
wanstead
asked
betsey
s
robert
cynthia
nodded
then
glanced
back
at
the
sands
below
and
gasped
where
an
instant
before
had
been
wet
sand
with
a
few
thin
streams
across
it
a
dozen
rushing
rivers
now
flowed
joining
swiftly
into
a
relentless
heaving
sea
frightening
isn
t
it
said
betsey
s
robert
we
saw
it
rise
like
that
two
days
ago
that
s
why
i
m
here
i
know
how
dangerous
it
is
and
i
want
to
thank
you
for
bringing
betsey
back
yesterday
you
and
miss
oh
murmured
cynthia
it
it
wasn
t
then
she
laughed
i
mean
of
course
it
was
a
lot
only
she
would
have
got
back
she
says
she
wouldn
t
of
course
she
could
have
stayed
there
eight
or
nine
or
you
could
have
sent
for
her
in
a
boat
suggested
the
more
practical
cynthia
anyway
i
m
tremendously
he
sat
down
on
the
wall
beside
her
imposing
isn
t
it
he
gestured
toward
the
great
abbey
behind
them
one
of
the
most
imposing
sites
in
all
the
world
and
combined
with
what
man
has
done
to
it
it
s
stupendous
you
re
an
artist
aren
t
you
cynthia
admitted
it
and
you
too
and
betsey
s
a
smart
and
suddenly
cynthia
thought
why
he
s
awfully
in
love
with
her
and
liked
him
better
even
if
he
were
as
stubborn
as
a
mule
is
she
she
asked
aloud
and
ingenuously
so
that
robert
had
to
brag
a
little
she
s
worked
for
cochran
you
know
costumes
with
quiet
pride
in
the
ability
of
his
fiancée
marvelous
she
must
be
good
though
of
course
he
takes
lots
of
beginners
doesn
t
he
for
a
short
tryout
she
knew
nothing
of
the
kind
but
spoke
as
one
with
inside
information
robert
flushed
and
set
his
jaw
not
at
all
he
said
stiffly
betsey
s
good
enough
to
keep
on
with
him
show
after
show
and
to
get
work
in
new
york
too
if
she
really
cynthia
s
eyebrows
expressed
her
scepticism
only
of
course
once
she
s
married
i
mean
no
girl
can
really
manage
two
jobs
can
she
she
almost
giggled
at
the
way
he
took
it
i
his
mouth
hung
open
a
minute
but
stubborn
people
were
contrary
too
and
robert
was
no
exception
well
after
all
i
expect
to
keep
on
with
architecture
after
i
m
oh
yes
but
a
man
cynthia
s
air
was
still
one
of
polite
incredulity
here
s
betsey
buttercup
hair
windblown
cheeks
very
pink
but
my
dear
you
ve
been
crying
again
thought
cynthia
and
wondered
if
it
wouldn
t
be
tactful
to
withdraw
immediately
betsey
herself
answered
that
finished
your
sketch
cynthia
i
m
so
glad
you
waited
i
ve
got
a
telegram
to
show
you
i
m
leaving
tonight
if
i
can
get
across
to
the
she
was
carefully
avoiding
robert
s
eyes
betsey
had
a
little
pink
slip
in
her
hand
cynthia
took
it
and
read
aloud
as
well
as
she
could
the
garbled
english
of
the
french
wire
miss
elizabeth
comstock
hotel
des
poissons
and
so
on
please
be
in
london
monday
the
eleventh
my
office
stop
wish
to
talk
over
two
scenes
in
new
revue
stop
charles
so
betsey
had
made
her
decision
what
would
betsey
s
robert
say
to
that
cynthia
looked
up
was
about
to
burst
into
congratulations
when
the
man
forestalled
her
betsey
i
m
so
glad
but
hadn
t
we
better
hurry
i
ve
got
to
pack
and
you
know
how
slow
i
am
we
ll
get
your
dad
to
chaperon
us
as
far
as
london
and
get
married
there
instead
of
in
paris
this
cochran
thing
is
too
grand
a
chance
to
cynthia
viewing
betsey
s
radiant
astonishment
thought
almost
smugly
what
price
nancy
s
little
miss
chapter
basque
the
cuckoo
it
was
nancy
and
brewster
who
had
suggested
the
basque
country
this
was
partly
because
cynthia
needed
a
new
type
of
child
s
head
for
her
covers
for
one
s
and
partly
because
they
thought
it
would
be
a
new
and
amusing
adventure
it
bore
also
the
extra
recommendation
of
economy
brewster
had
a
friend
in
a
tiny
village
well
off
the
beaten
track
of
tourists
he
was
an
artist
he
would
see
that
cynthia
found
good
accommodations
if
not
in
his
own
house
then
in
a
house
nearby
good
she
would
write
to
him
find
out
for
sure
if
he
was
still
living
for
he
was
she
said
old
old
the
basque
country
seemed
to
cynthia
a
very
long
way
off
from
paris
and
from
the
brewsters
in
brittany
and
from
all
the
places
she
had
grown
to
know
the
scare
and
loneliness
of
paris
had
been
exorcised
by
her
first
success
with
the
portrait
of
nono
no
place
where
you
can
earn
a
living
can
be
after
you
have
proved
yourself
really
strange
or
unfriendly
but
miles
and
miles
away
in
the
southwestern
corner
of
france
it
might
be
different
somewhat
reluctantly
feeling
a
little
forlorn
and
abandoned
cynthia
left
the
brewsters
in
britanny
and
returned
to
paris
france
is
a
great
spider
web
of
glittering
rails
of
railways
but
paris
like
a
giant
not
unfriendly
spider
sits
in
the
heart
if
not
the
exact
center
and
to
go
almost
anywhere
it
is
cheaper
and
easier
to
return
to
that
city
and
start
all
over
again
an
hour
on
the
train
and
the
feeling
of
forlornness
began
to
disappear
under
nancy
s
stern
tutelage
cynthia
s
french
had
improved
enormously
now
she
knew
how
to
order
a
meal
where
and
how
to
buy
her
lunch
if
there
was
no
dining
car
on
the
train
knew
that
she
must
give
up
her
ticket
at
the
exit
barrier
but
retain
it
until
then
and
half
a
hundred
other
small
things
that
went
to
make
life
and
travel
smoother
and
more
pleasant
going
back
to
paris
was
almost
like
going
home
again
her
own
little
room
up
near
the
roof
in
the
hotel
severin
or
one
very
like
it
except
that
the
wallpaper
sprawled
magenta
fuschias
on
a
green
ground
instead
of
huge
coins
of
blue
and
gold
and
purple
on
a
red
ground
a
dinner
with
alice
and
the
murchisons
and
a
pressing
invitation
to
bring
over
her
bags
from
the
hotel
and
stay
with
them
as
long
as
she
could
then
she
encountered
of
all
people
stasia
carruthers
in
front
of
the
café
de
la
paix
and
was
carried
off
to
rumplemeier
s
for
one
of
their
scrumptious
teas
news
was
exchanged
stasia
had
been
down
to
switzerland
was
back
now
for
some
fittings
and
to
buy
some
new
hats
gaily
cynthia
plunged
into
her
own
adventures
even
to
how
she
had
sold
three
portraits
of
children
in
the
little
town
of
le
conquet
once
she
had
succeeded
in
breaking
down
the
reserve
of
the
villagers
for
just
a
little
while
she
found
herself
envying
stasia
her
new
smart
little
paris
hat
her
trick
little
silk
suit
fresh
from
the
scissors
of
chanel
looking
up
suddenly
she
surprised
a
strange
expression
in
stasia
s
dark
eyes
could
it
be
envy
envy
for
the
greater
adventure
of
earning
your
way
anyone
could
buy
his
way
on
a
fat
letter
of
credit
but
to
earn
as
you
went
that
was
the
greater
risk
hence
the
greater
adventure
cynthia
chuckled
to
herself
tucked
a
stray
curl
beneath
the
brim
of
the
hat
she
had
bought
for
fifty
francs
in
the
rue
roch
and
ceased
to
envy
stasia
two
days
later
having
restocked
her
box
of
water
colors
on
the
boulevard
montparnasse
that
parnassus
of
all
good
little
art
students
she
took
train
at
some
uncanny
hour
of
the
early
morning
for
bordeaux
there
late
in
the
afternoon
and
from
the
shouting
hotel
runners
at
the
station
each
screaming
the
particular
merits
of
his
own
hotel
she
chose
the
hotel
de
new
york
it
seemed
homelike
as
to
name
at
least
it
proved
dingy
and
down
at
heels
but
with
a
charming
view
out
over
one
of
bordeaux
countless
city
squares
cynthia
yawned
through
her
dinner
left
an
early
call
for
breakfast
and
was
off
again
almost
before
daylight
for
gotien
in
the
three
times
that
day
she
changed
trains
until
from
sheer
weariness
gotien
began
to
seem
like
some
land
always
retreating
as
one
advanced
and
beyond
gotien
the
address
she
was
bound
for
was
she
had
gone
through
the
gate
with
her
suitcase
and
sketch
box
and
stood
almost
shaking
with
weariness
full
in
the
afternoon
sun
that
streamed
across
the
dusty
cobblestoned
plaza
no
one
could
tell
her
how
to
get
to
but
perhaps
if
she
could
find
the
station
hotel
get
a
good
dinner
and
a
night
s
sleep
she
could
grapple
tomorrow
with
the
problem
then
from
beyond
the
ragged
plane
trees
that
lined
the
plaza
came
a
little
shabby
man
in
a
basque
beret
timidly
displaying
a
wide
toothless
smile
his
english
savored
quaintly
of
both
french
and
american
is
it
that
this
is
the
mademoiselle
euanstead
cynthia
squinted
against
the
sun
she
was
too
weary
to
think
was
someone
to
meet
her
here
yes
i
m
miss
we
had
the
letter
from
madame
oh
then
you
are
monsieur
marge
how
nice
i
couldn
t
discover
a
train
for
no
train
he
shook
his
head
only
the
tramcars
but
come
and
meet
my
madame
was
a
plump
little
dumpling
in
plain
worn
black
knitting
on
one
of
the
benches
beneath
the
trees
she
beamed
a
silent
welcome
and
carried
her
knitting
with
her
needles
clicking
without
a
break
into
the
tram
which
had
been
waiting
small
town
fashion
for
monsieur
marge
to
find
his
guest
for
an
hour
while
cynthia
struggled
to
keep
her
eyes
open
they
rattled
and
banged
through
clouds
of
dust
toward
the
tiny
town
of
mouleon
then
out
again
into
open
country
sunset
had
passed
and
it
was
nearly
dark
when
they
reached
their
final
stop
and
cynthia
stumbled
up
the
path
behind
her
hosts
twice
during
the
simple
dinner
she
found
herself
nodding
then
at
some
brief
remark
from
madame
monsieur
marge
suggested
kindly
my
wife
sees
that
you
are
very
tired
i
will
light
the
candle
and
show
you
to
your
behind
him
a
silly
little
cuckoo
clock
chirped
nine
times
as
cynthia
stumbled
up
the
bed
cynthia
woke
slowly
aware
of
an
unusual
sound
something
someone
was
snoring
surely
no
the
sound
couldn
t
possibly
be
human
she
lay
still
a
moment
listening
then
decided
she
really
must
investigate
and
sat
up
against
her
pillows
she
was
in
a
high
bed
such
a
bed
as
might
have
accommodated
the
princess
of
a
grimm
with
four
high
posts
heavy
dark
draperies
sweeping
the
floor
and
actually
three
little
steps
of
a
ladder
to
lead
up
to
it
she
leaned
over
and
peered
down
at
them
then
gave
a
delighted
bounce
she
had
been
too
sleepy
the
night
before
to
notice
those
steps
but
she
did
remember
her
host
s
very
french
warning
that
the
night
air
was
dangerous
and
that
she
must
keep
her
windows
tight
closed
but
after
madame
and
monsieur
had
departed
she
had
crossed
to
the
casements
and
opened
them
wide
now
she
pattered
barefooted
down
the
steps
and
leaned
out
over
the
low
sill
the
curious
snores
came
from
just
below
grunts
not
snores
oh
the
darlings
pigs
little
ones
and
all
ten
of
them
very
vocal
and
very
hungry
and
directly
beneath
her
window
well
i
never
thought
i
d
live
over
a
pigpen
laughed
cynthia
isn
t
that
france
for
you
at
the
end
of
the
long
room
a
dusty
old
mirror
in
a
tall
gold
frame
reflected
the
polished
parquet
floor
with
its
dark
oak
inlay
the
huge
heavy
furniture
built
to
last
many
lifetimes
the
two
high
windows
and
the
basque
pyrénées
towering
blue
beyond
the
green
of
rolling
fields
in
the
center
of
it
all
cynthia
herself
like
some
new
kind
of
a
striped
pyjamaed
princess
dark
hair
a
tangle
of
curls
blue
eyes
wide
and
amused
bare
pink
toes
pattering
over
the
shining
floor
well
you
certainly
are
an
anach
anachronism
or
however
you
pronounce
it
when
you
mean
you
re
out
of
place
she
twinkled
at
the
fairy
in
the
mirror
wonder
what
time
they
breakfast
here
gosh
i
m
hungry
she
tiptoed
to
the
door
it
swung
silently
on
hinges
no
footsteps
sounded
below
but
there
was
a
murmur
of
soft
voices
the
smell
of
toast
she
sniffed
and
chocolate
then
from
somewhere
in
the
house
a
bird
call
sounded
nine
times
a
cuckoo
clock
nine
cuckoos
my
but
it
was
late
hurry
and
get
dressed
my
dear
she
scampered
back
to
fling
on
her
clothes
glory
what
a
day
she
must
have
slept
twelve
hours
solid
goodness
how
heavenly
the
pines
smelled
how
wonderful
this
peace
and
quiet
after
the
hot
asphalt
the
ceaseless
noise
the
rattle
and
scream
of
paris
she
ran
a
comb
through
her
hair
gave
a
dab
of
powder
to
her
nose
and
opened
the
door
again
the
wide
shallow
stairs
led
directly
into
the
kitchen
madame
looking
up
beamed
good
morning
from
her
work
over
the
stove
bon
jour
bon
jour
and
seemed
very
proud
of
even
that
much
french
her
own
language
was
basque
of
course
good
morning
mam
selle
euanstead
you
have
slep
well
gorgeously
is
this
for
me
monsieur
marge
a
single
place
at
the
kitchen
table
was
set
with
a
bowl
of
hot
cocoa
on
a
red
checked
napkin
there
was
another
napkin
a
big
spoon
crisp
hot
bread
fresh
toasted
in
the
oven
and
a
huge
sweet
orange
an
egg
also
asked
monsieur
marge
from
the
doorstep
where
he
sat
with
his
pipe
no
then
when
you
have
finished
a
second
cup
of
cocoa
i
shall
show
you
my
hive
and
my
bee
and
my
the
latter
proved
to
be
a
small
dingy
not
too
building
behind
the
rambling
whitewashed
house
here
dusty
canvases
and
dried
tubes
of
paint
bits
of
old
tapestry
and
ancient
were
piled
and
presided
over
by
two
of
those
artist
s
lay
figures
that
resemble
wigless
dolls
monsieur
marge
turned
over
the
quaint
old
pictures
to
display
them
and
cynthia
murmured
appreciation
trying
hard
to
find
something
to
admire
in
each
but
they
were
of
such
an
ancient
manner
of
the
brown
gravy
school
with
shadows
dead
as
brown
paint
and
thick
lifeless
color
that
proper
applause
was
difficult
you
know
i
paint
in
america
too
he
asked
her
proudly
yes
brewster
told
me
where
was
that
i
live
in
philadelphia
fifteen
years
that
was
before
the
war
then
i
live
in
south
america
with
my
son
long
time
many
basque
live
in
south
america
then
i
come
home
here
to
my
old
farm
i
buy
when
i
young
man
many
year
ago
that
was
before
you
were
he
chuckled
at
his
own
age
long
ago
i
paint
those
panorama
for
the
world
fair
in
goodness
did
you
i
ve
heard
of
them
but
never
saw
yes
indeed
they
be
he
spread
his
arms
to
indicate
an
immense
canvas
and
figures
modeled
like
life
i
paint
twelve
of
those
they
go
all
round
the
country
twelve
battle
of
gettysburg
with
men
in
uniform
in
the
wheat
field
battle
of
gettysburg
she
was
fought
in
a
wheat
he
chuckled
again
and
sucked
on
his
empty
pipe
we
work
all
night
many
night
on
that
to
get
her
ready
for
the
opening
of
the
fair
we
were
all
french
the
artists
who
work
on
her
but
the
day
after
the
opening
we
close
the
doors
again
take
her
down
and
paint
again
all
night
oh
why
cried
cynthia
because
he
grinned
in
cheerful
toothlessness
we
have
paint
wheat
field
full
of
puppies
american
wheat
field
have
no
and
he
roared
with
laughter
over
the
ancient
jest
pup
for
a
moment
cynthia
was
puzzled
then
she
too
laughed
oh
yes
for
all
day
yesterday
she
had
admired
the
glorious
silky
red
flowers
blooming
among
the
wheat
beside
the
railway
you
want
to
paint
this
morning
and
when
cynthia
decided
that
she
might
as
well
start
immediately
go
down
the
road
and
then
turn
right
by
the
mill
that
is
near
and
pretty
and
tomorrow
you
can
go
further
you
have
everything
you
want
oil
turpentine
oh
you
paint
in
the
water
color
that
is
pretty
so
cynthia
settled
down
contentedly
on
the
old
basque
farm
it
was
two
miles
through
the
hot
sunlight
to
the
nearest
village
but
she
found
plenty
to
paint
within
easy
walking
distance
of
the
marge
house
nearby
houses
with
their
spanish
iron
balconies
overhung
with
roses
and
vines
the
sturdy
basque
farmers
at
work
in
the
fields
and
their
great
cream
colored
oxen
that
paced
so
slowly
along
the
road
the
houses
were
white
with
steep
roofs
and
wide
eaves
of
deep
gray
and
heavy
shutters
painted
green
and
the
vines
sprayed
with
arsenic
green
made
rich
shadow
patterns
on
the
old
walls
then
she
found
an
old
stone
church
with
the
tower
so
characteristic
of
basque
village
churches
and
beneath
its
porch
an
iron
grill
to
discourage
the
pigs
from
entering
the
place
of
worship
she
peeped
through
the
stone
doorways
where
the
lintels
bore
blurred
dates
of
the
early
seventeenth
century
to
peer
into
the
dim
dark
timbered
kitchens
on
whose
hearthstones
a
tiny
fire
of
twigs
burned
beneath
the
black
kettle
on
a
crane
with
many
of
the
women
she
had
a
pleasant
nodding
and
smiling
acquaintance
but
she
spoke
no
word
of
their
language
and
found
that
her
french
was
not
understood
besides
these
people
seemed
unusually
reserved
she
could
establish
no
contact
with
them
cynthia
began
to
suspect
that
monsieur
marge
was
in
a
similar
position
and
was
very
lonely
because
of
it
he
had
lived
so
long
in
america
that
he
had
lost
touch
with
these
his
own
people
and
when
he
had
returned
to
them
found
that
they
considered
him
a
foreigner
he
was
now
neither
basque
nor
american
it
was
a
valley
of
enchantment
hidden
between
the
high
snow
capped
peaks
of
the
pyrénées
each
day
was
as
as
sunny
and
warm
as
the
one
before
it
and
cynthia
woke
each
morning
in
her
fairytale
bed
to
look
forward
to
another
bright
morning
of
painting
another
sleepy
afternoon
of
sketching
still
she
reminded
herself
after
a
week
of
this
she
wasn
t
getting
any
further
with
her
job
for
the
month
she
had
come
down
here
to
do
a
basque
cover
for
the
ones
somewhere
she
must
find
herself
a
model
her
second
week
in
the
basque
country
had
started
monday
slipped
by
tuesday
evening
she
sat
as
usual
on
the
doorstep
after
a
late
dinner
monsieur
marge
smoked
placidly
madame
knitted
in
the
half
dark
of
the
verandah
there
was
a
sound
of
cattle
bells
far
down
the
smooth
winding
road
and
the
mountains
leaned
purple
dark
against
the
sunset
cynthia
and
the
old
man
had
been
comparing
their
memories
of
old
songs
astonishing
how
many
of
the
old
ones
the
really
old
ones
that
belonged
to
mother
s
even
to
grandmother
s
day
he
remembered
from
his
years
in
america
there
was
sweet
marie
and
sweet
rosey
o
grady
and
sidewalks
of
new
oh
yes
they
sing
that
still
cried
cynthia
and
whistled
it
with
him
madame
hummed
and
smiled
placidly
while
her
fingers
seemed
to
twinkle
in
time
to
the
gay
little
tune
a
bicycle
built
for
two
he
suggested
yes
cynthia
knew
that
one
she
had
heard
it
in
the
movies
a
moment
of
silence
then
while
they
paused
to
think
of
more
and
from
the
dark
room
behind
them
came
a
cheerful
cuck
oo
cuckoo
what
makes
the
bird
in
the
clock
cuckoo
asked
cynthia
when
she
had
finished
counting
nine
warbles
wait
i
show
monsieur
sprang
to
his
feet
and
disappeared
into
the
kitchen
to
return
a
moment
later
with
the
clock
beneath
his
arm
madame
gave
a
little
chuckle
and
monsieur
explained
we
bought
this
on
our
wedding
trip
in
switzerland
almost
fifty
years
he
set
it
down
on
the
step
and
returned
for
a
lamp
which
he
lighted
and
placed
beside
the
clock
then
with
delicate
fingers
he
removed
the
screws
in
the
back
and
exposed
the
carved
wooden
works
for
cynthia
to
see
unlike
the
usual
this
was
all
without
the
long
pendulum
and
the
heavy
iron
weights
that
usually
hang
down
below
the
little
box
its
face
and
the
surrounding
frame
was
like
old
lace
interwoven
with
tiny
intricate
figures
and
small
deer
and
cows
and
squirrels
the
whole
dark
with
age
and
good
french
furniture
polish
see
explained
the
old
man
there
are
two
little
b
lows
here
and
here
and
his
finger
indicated
the
tiny
bellows
of
leather
like
those
used
to
blow
a
fire
now
watch
i
make
him
he
turned
the
white
hands
to
ten
o
clock
and
the
cuckoo
popped
out
opened
his
little
red
mouth
and
warbled
one
small
bellow
went
and
the
other
immediately
afterwards
went
cuck
oo
cuck
oo
over
and
over
ten
times
oh
i
never
knew
what
made
him
do
it
cried
cynthia
now
let
me
the
bird
popped
out
in
such
a
quaintly
serious
fashion
that
one
wanted
to
laugh
every
time
he
appeared
i
will
keep
him
here
and
oil
him
in
the
morning
decided
monsieur
marge
perhaps
in
the
night
he
will
attract
other
cuckoos
yes
madame
chuckled
does
she
understand
english
asked
cynthia
getting
up
to
put
the
clock
on
the
verandah
table
i
un
stand
murmured
madame
in
the
darkness
and
her
husband
shook
his
head
only
little
but
she
too
lazy
to
speak
anything
but
basque
we
are
conservative
peepul
we
basque
per
aps
it
is
as
well
otherwise
we
could
not
remain
so
entrench
against
the
centuries
of
invaders
and
of
and
as
the
night
deepened
and
the
stars
came
out
cynthia
heard
old
tales
of
charlemagne
and
of
his
blond
barbarians
from
the
north
who
had
been
defeated
in
these
very
hills
of
how
the
basque
had
dwelt
here
for
hundreds
perhaps
even
thousands
of
years
unconquered
unchanging
it
may
be
because
our
language
is
so
difficul
explained
the
old
man
with
pride
we
have
a
saying
that
the
devil
once
came
here
to
our
country
and
stayed
seven
years
in
that
time
he
learn
but
two
words
by
for
yes
and
es
for
at
las
disgusted
by
his
waste
of
time
he
flew
away
again
and
soon
forgot
even
those
two
that
is
why
the
evil
never
comes
he
sighed
in
the
darkness
and
cynthia
felt
a
pang
of
pity
even
here
among
his
own
people
he
was
homesick
denied
a
closer
contact
with
them
because
of
his
long
years
in
america
the
next
morning
cynthia
unfolded
the
camp
stool
on
which
she
sat
to
sketch
beneath
the
vines
at
the
side
of
the
farmhouse
a
walk
ran
back
to
the
little
ramshackle
studio
and
marge
pottered
about
in
the
sunlight
with
his
beehives
cynthia
opened
her
sketch
book
squeezed
color
onto
her
palette
and
set
to
work
the
cuckoo
clock
behind
her
ticked
steadily
with
no
relation
to
the
hour
of
the
day
cynthia
rapidly
sketching
in
the
grape
arbor
and
the
green
door
in
the
white
wall
beyond
it
wondered
how
to
get
the
effect
of
spattered
sunlight
where
the
light
dribbled
down
through
leaves
and
discovered
with
a
little
thrill
that
part
of
the
trick
lay
in
breaking
the
color
patting
it
on
in
little
spats
of
the
brush
with
flecks
of
white
paper
showing
between
part
in
letting
the
shadow
actually
dribble
off
her
brush
so
that
it
was
lightest
farthest
from
the
leaves
a
small
cooing
voice
sounded
behind
her
turning
she
saw
on
the
path
a
little
girl
of
six
or
maybe
less
very
basque
in
her
bright
blouse
and
dark
blue
cotton
skirt
and
bare
brown
feet
thrust
into
rope
soled
espadrilles
her
eyes
were
soft
and
brown
and
her
hair
had
been
plaited
into
two
pigtails
so
tight
that
they
seemed
actually
to
drag
her
eyelids
upwards
at
the
corners
oh
you
duck
breathed
cynthia
what
fun
if
i
could
paint
you
the
brown
eyes
danced
with
mischief
and
the
small
mouth
was
puckered
into
a
demure
rosebud
what
could
have
drawn
her
up
the
path
from
the
road
cynthia
s
glance
followed
the
child
s
the
tick
of
the
clock
but
surely
she
had
heard
a
clock
before
then
cynthia
remembered
that
a
moment
before
it
had
erratically
struck
eleven
laughing
she
gestured
a
query
towards
the
clock
was
that
it
the
small
one
nodded
shyly
sure
i
ll
show
it
to
you
cynthia
offered
want
to
see
the
birdie
do
you
she
put
down
book
and
brushes
and
led
the
way
up
the
steps
then
she
turned
the
hands
gently
as
she
had
seen
marge
do
the
night
before
the
bird
answered
with
a
startled
cuck
oo
oh
the
brown
eyes
danced
with
delight
the
small
hands
clapped
the
child
came
closer
now
the
next
will
be
twelve
cynthia
said
though
of
course
that
wouldn
t
mean
anything
to
this
infant
and
turned
the
hands
again
this
time
the
bird
gave
a
most
satisfactory
performance
by
the
time
his
song
was
finished
the
child
s
face
was
so
close
to
the
little
flapping
doors
that
cynthia
was
afraid
she
would
pop
inside
out
of
sheer
rapturous
delight
if
i
could
get
her
just
so
with
her
head
turned
like
that
and
those
quaint
little
pigtails
and
the
sunlight
behind
her
but
i
m
afraid
i
m
not
clever
enough
mourned
cynthia
no
it
s
then
to
the
child
birdie
s
all
gone
my
dear
no
more
today
i
refuse
to
ruin
marge
s
wedding
present
just
because
a
basque
baby
wants
to
hear
the
cuckoo
clock
sit
down
won
t
you
and
amuse
me
while
i
monsieur
marge
came
up
the
walk
from
his
beehives
he
said
something
in
basque
to
the
child
who
answered
stammeringly
she
should
not
be
here
he
explained
she
lives
down
there
the
yturbe
house
she
is
the
only
one
left
the
two
sons
died
in
the
war
and
this
is
the
only
grandchild
the
old
people
worship
her
i
will
take
her
cynthia
was
sorry
to
see
her
go
i
wish
i
could
paint
her
she
thought
again
wistfully
but
she
knew
marge
was
not
on
good
enough
terms
with
his
neighbors
to
make
the
unusual
request
this
was
not
paris
where
everyone
knew
about
artists
and
where
models
seem
to
drop
ripe
from
every
blossom
in
every
with
your
breakfast
cocoa
that
afternoon
a
hive
of
bees
swarmed
and
marge
was
so
busy
with
them
that
the
little
cuckoo
clock
waited
another
night
unoiled
upon
the
verandah
i
ll
do
the
job
tomorrow
and
put
it
back
in
the
morning
he
promised
madame
it
is
quite
safe
but
apparently
it
wasn
t
so
safe
at
least
when
cynthia
came
down
to
breakfast
marge
reported
the
clock
was
gone
gone
the
cuckoo
clock
cynthia
heard
herself
repeating
idiotically
well
but
goodness
who
on
earth
would
take
it
marge
shook
his
head
and
madame
pouring
the
morning
chocolate
murmured
something
in
basque
she
says
she
is
sorry
to
lose
our
wedding
oh
dear
i
feel
terribly
responsible
mourned
cynthia
if
i
only
hadn
t
asked
you
to
bring
it
out
and
show
it
is
my
own
the
old
man
became
firmly
cheerful
mais
non
mademoiselle
i
am
a
careless
old
man
i
should
not
have
left
the
clock
on
the
verandah
but
the
basque
are
honest
peepul
we
do
not
steal
and
we
are
too
far
from
the
town
for
gypsies
or
tramps
i
can
not
figure
it
cynthia
painted
that
morning
with
a
wretched
feeling
of
responsibility
i
could
get
them
a
new
clock
she
told
herself
but
it
wouldn
t
be
the
she
had
chosen
a
spot
down
the
main
road
where
two
small
stone
houses
overgrown
with
rambling
roses
were
as
theatrically
picturesque
as
a
scene
from
the
follies
but
the
sketch
was
not
very
satisfactory
it
s
not
my
kind
of
thing
she
fretted
it
s
fun
to
do
but
i
d
rather
paint
people
wonder
where
my
little
friend
of
yesterday
is
she
must
live
in
one
of
those
houses
a
team
of
oxen
plodded
slowly
down
the
dusty
road
brilliantly
golden
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
blue
dyed
sheepskin
that
lay
atop
their
heavy
yoke
their
eyes
hidden
behind
a
heavy
fringe
of
bright
colored
net
their
driver
walked
ahead
his
over
his
shoulder
rested
on
the
yoke
to
guide
the
animals
cynthia
listened
to
the
soft
jangle
of
bells
till
it
died
in
the
distance
then
decided
she
was
hungry
that
was
what
must
be
wrong
with
her
sketch
and
packed
up
her
materials
the
marges
never
ate
lunch
cynthia
had
discovered
that
a
continental
breakfast
did
not
sustain
one
very
well
from
eight
till
five
in
the
afternoon
and
after
two
days
of
had
persuaded
madame
to
give
her
a
cold
meal
at
noon
today
there
was
sliced
duckling
and
a
pleasant
salad
set
on
the
red
checked
table
cloth
beneath
the
sun
spangled
arbor
she
finished
her
raspberries
with
the
thick
pat
of
rich
sour
cream
and
the
crust
of
warm
bread
and
idly
watched
marge
talking
to
someone
beyond
the
beehives
it
looked
like
the
old
man
in
the
yturbe
household
thomasina
s
grandfather
cynthia
wondered
at
that
for
she
knew
the
two
men
were
not
close
friends
i
wish
i
could
get
that
child
to
paint
she
thought
idly
remembering
the
small
eager
face
of
the
day
before
marge
came
slowly
and
alone
up
the
stone
flagged
walk
and
sat
down
on
the
step
beside
cynthia
s
luncheon
table
there
must
be
gypsies
here
he
stated
for
thomasina
has
been
thomasina
cried
cynthia
aghast
how
perfectly
dreadful
and
felt
her
throat
tighten
for
a
moment
she
could
not
speak
for
fear
of
bursting
into
tears
little
thomasina
when
how
long
she
asked
after
a
moment
perhaps
not
stolen
perhaps
but
she
has
been
gone
since
early
this
morning
it
is
two
now
she
did
not
come
home
for
her
noon
meal
her
grandfather
came
to
ask
if
we
had
seen
her
she
has
never
gone
from
the
dooryard
before
not
until
yesterday
when
she
came
here
her
father
thinks
she
may
have
strayed
down
the
road
and
met
someone
she
was
very
unhappy
over
a
little
thrush
they
had
which
died
she
may
have
been
looking
for
cynthia
knew
those
little
thrushes
in
their
willow
cages
which
hung
outside
so
many
french
doorways
they
are
afraid
of
the
canal
and
the
oh
but
surely
cynthia
shivered
and
was
silent
no
nothing
like
that
could
happen
to
someone
that
one
knew
absently
she
pushed
away
the
last
of
her
raspberries
they
were
her
favorite
fruit
but
she
had
lost
any
appetite
for
them
painting
this
afternoon
asked
her
host
trying
to
be
cheerful
yes
cynthia
had
thought
she
d
take
the
tram
into
the
tiny
village
and
sketch
the
interior
of
the
old
ruined
fort
with
the
remains
of
the
and
guardhouse
monsieur
marge
surveyed
the
sky
unflinchingly
blue
too
hot
to
go
into
town
he
commented
why
not
stay
and
we
go
hunt
for
mushrooms
madame
wishes
some
for
the
dinner
tonight
i
know
deep
woods
cool
where
the
sun
does
not
cynthia
had
never
gathered
mushrooms
it
sounded
like
a
new
and
amusing
experience
and
it
would
certainly
be
cooler
than
sketching
on
that
hot
and
sunny
hill
beyond
the
town
besides
she
didn
t
really
want
to
go
far
from
the
house
in
case
little
thomasina
should
be
found
no
she
should
be
found
cynthia
went
to
her
room
for
a
wide
shade
hat
and
came
downstairs
again
to
find
marge
ready
for
her
he
bore
a
leather
bound
the
basque
walking
stick
with
its
graven
brass
binding
and
leather
strap
won
t
we
need
a
basket
or
something
no
i
show
the
method
it
seemed
was
to
string
the
fungus
on
a
long
thin
peeled
rod
they
were
big
things
flabby
and
pale
lavender
rather
like
unpleasantly
raw
liver
but
monsieur
assured
her
they
were
delicious
when
cooked
they
had
found
the
grove
about
two
miles
from
the
house
up
an
old
logging
road
now
nearly
overgrown
with
brush
and
deep
damp
moss
the
pines
rose
huge
and
straight
and
the
air
was
cool
but
after
an
hour
or
more
of
scrabbling
over
dead
logs
and
grubbing
among
fallen
leaves
for
the
mushrooms
cynthia
was
glad
to
sink
wearily
to
a
seat
on
a
mossy
stone
but
i
m
weary
goodness
how
you
can
walk
she
exclaimed
to
the
pleased
old
man
i
have
been
hard
worker
in
my
there
s
a
funny
noise
about
here
cynthia
commented
after
a
moment
of
silence
sounds
rather
like
a
cricket
yet
not
i
wonder
she
listened
again
and
as
the
old
man
started
to
speak
held
up
her
hand
for
silence
there
was
no
breeze
the
pine
boughs
high
overhead
scarcely
moved
there
were
certainly
no
crickets
about
yet
what
was
that
noise
then
from
a
thicket
just
a
few
yards
away
came
a
familiar
call
cuck
oo
cuck
ooooo
your
clock
cynthia
almost
shouted
and
jumped
to
her
feet
monsieur
marge
was
right
behind
her
as
she
parted
the
brush
looked
downward
she
chuckled
and
held
back
the
branch
that
he
might
see
there
wrapped
in
an
old
shawl
and
fast
asleep
was
thomasina
yturbe
in
her
arms
its
placid
little
face
turned
to
the
skies
ticked
the
imperturbable
cuckoo
clock
well
we
ve
found
one
kidnapper
at
least
laughed
cynthia
somewhat
shakily
shall
we
wake
her
up
poor
little
thing
she
had
come
a
long
way
in
this
heat
and
the
clock
was
quite
a
weight
for
those
small
arms
it
is
too
far
to
carry
her
home
advised
the
old
man
the
child
stirred
at
his
voice
opened
one
sleepy
eye
her
face
was
pink
as
a
seashell
from
the
rough
warmth
of
the
old
shawl
beneath
her
for
a
moment
she
blinked
like
a
little
owl
then
recognized
them
and
beamed
murmuring
something
monsieur
chuckled
and
repeated
it
for
cynthia
s
benefit
she
said
the
bird
wouldn
t
come
on
honey
time
to
go
cynthia
s
words
might
not
have
been
understood
but
her
brightly
matter
of
fact
tone
was
sufficient
thomasina
scrambled
to
her
feet
here
better
let
me
take
the
clock
no
all
right
but
let
me
carry
the
shawl
anyway
i
wonder
why
she
brought
the
shawl
she
puzzled
monsieur
had
the
suggestion
that
it
had
been
one
thrown
over
the
thrush
s
cage
at
night
poor
kid
murmured
cynthia
it
was
a
long
journey
back
monsieur
had
the
two
long
sticks
of
mushrooms
cynthia
toward
the
last
was
so
far
trusted
as
to
be
allowed
the
clock
but
thomasina
kept
one
hand
in
cynthia
s
one
was
to
understand
that
she
was
not
weary
but
she
wanted
closer
contact
with
her
little
bird
the
clock
itself
ticked
steadily
throughout
the
journey
and
twice
it
even
cuckooed
it
was
late
and
the
sun
was
low
throwing
long
shadows
across
the
road
as
they
came
down
it
towards
the
yturbe
farm
cynthia
heard
the
soft
cooing
of
doves
the
grunt
of
the
little
pigs
that
lived
beneath
her
window
thomasina
stumbled
once
or
twice
they
neared
the
doorway
with
its
seventeenth
century
date
on
the
lintel
someone
inside
was
sobbing
i
won
t
go
with
cynthia
pushed
the
child
forward
and
nodded
that
monsieur
marge
was
to
follow
her
this
might
be
who
could
tell
just
the
right
moment
for
him
to
become
a
basque
again
thomasina
the
clock
again
in
her
arms
stumbled
through
the
doorway
cynthia
heard
nothing
for
a
moment
then
such
a
heartfelt
cry
of
delight
and
joy
as
made
her
for
the
second
time
that
day
brush
away
the
tears
followed
in
three
voices
much
talk
in
the
rapid
basque
tongue
and
after
a
moment
grandmother
yturbe
came
out
to
throw
her
arms
about
the
petite
americaine
she
says
twinkled
monsieur
behind
her
that
you
are
wonderful
that
you
found
her
little
non
non
it
was
monsieur
cynthia
gestured
towards
her
host
it
s
all
right
anyway
thomasina
would
have
come
home
for
dinner
protested
the
embarrassed
cynthia
they
got
away
at
last
but
there
was
more
to
come
after
dinner
cynthia
and
madame
were
sitting
beneath
the
vines
madame
s
fingers
flew
steadily
as
her
needles
ate
up
the
gray
yarn
and
moonlight
bright
as
day
dripped
through
the
dark
leaves
of
the
arbor
someone
came
slowly
up
the
stone
walk
and
spoke
in
basque
it
was
thomasina
s
grandfather
he
has
come
to
thank
the
american
lady
explained
marge
after
a
moment
s
conversation
and
added
that
he
had
told
yturbe
that
thomasina
was
to
keep
the
clock
for
herself
after
all
we
have
no
grandchildren
and
a
moment
later
he
translated
again
he
asks
if
the
american
lady
will
do
him
a
portrait
of
his
little
one
he
will
of
course
be
proud
to
pay
for
i
d
adore
it
cried
cynthia
oh
what
a
day
the
men
moved
off
together
talking
cynthia
saw
them
cross
the
road
slowly
two
old
men
together
madame
chuckling
richly
made
one
of
her
rare
remarks
in
english
they
not
be
back
till
but
she
seemed
more
pleased
than
concerned
i
guess
that
means
marge
has
become
all
basque
at
last
thought
cynthia
sleepily
chapter
romance
in
carcassonne
cynthia
had
long
ago
learned
how
to
say
in
french
stand
still
turn
a
little
to
the
right
to
the
left
raise
the
chin
and
finally
and
most
urgent
again
stand
still
one
needed
these
phrases
constantly
in
the
one
language
the
model
understood
she
had
had
occasion
to
use
them
all
and
more
besides
this
afternoon
for
the
ragged
little
urchin
posing
against
a
background
of
old
stone
house
and
carved
fourteenth
century
doorway
was
an
imp
though
a
delightful
one
and
had
far
too
large
a
circle
of
friends
vitally
interested
in
what
he
was
doing
cynthia
glanced
up
from
her
painting
and
for
the
twentieth
time
in
ten
minutes
sighed
in
exasperation
every
small
child
s
head
including
of
course
the
model
s
had
turned
to
watch
the
small
group
crossing
the
square
it
was
just
the
usual
collection
of
american
tourists
every
child
in
the
city
must
have
seen
their
like
hundreds
of
times
herded
by
the
carcassonne
guide
an
old
of
the
great
war
cynthia
herself
had
twice
been
round
the
wonderful
old
walls
with
him
so
she
knew
quite
well
what
the
others
were
about
to
hear
of
the
ancient
old
towers
fifty
of
them
and
the
ramparts
dating
back
and
back
to
the
tenth
century
the
foundations
older
even
than
that
for
the
romans
had
held
a
fortress
here
of
the
lovely
little
cathedral
of
saint
nazaire
set
like
a
jewel
in
the
heart
of
the
town
all
these
and
more
would
the
visiting
americans
see
the
small
model
and
his
friends
must
know
by
heart
every
syllable
of
the
guide
s
lecture
every
stone
of
the
city
by
now
so
why
need
they
turn
like
a
group
of
little
monkeys
just
because
someone
had
crossed
the
square
oh
sit
still
she
muttered
crossly
in
french
the
sketch
was
a
good
one
the
best
she
had
made
this
week
now
if
she
could
get
just
the
right
hue
of
the
shadow
on
his
shoulder
for
several
minutes
the
shadow
and
the
mixing
of
it
from
her
color
box
held
her
absorbed
then
an
undue
amount
of
chatter
even
for
a
group
of
small
french
boys
watching
an
american
lady
who
made
the
caused
her
to
glance
up
again
one
of
the
american
tourists
had
let
the
group
go
on
without
her
and
had
come
across
to
stand
behind
cynthia
she
was
a
tall
girl
pretty
though
pale
with
big
black
eyes
and
curly
dark
lashes
and
a
smart
american
traveling
suit
of
blue
and
white
wash
silk
in
a
low
tone
she
was
chatting
with
the
children
and
with
such
amazing
ease
and
flourish
of
idiom
that
cynthia
with
a
pang
of
envy
thought
canadian
or
louisiana
bred
she
s
grown
up
with
the
language
oh
darn
that
model
look
here
she
turned
to
address
the
visitor
i
wish
you
d
tell
this
little
devil
that
i
won
t
pay
him
the
two
francs
i
d
promised
him
unless
he
sits
still
for
ten
more
minutes
then
he
can
go
my
vocabulary
simply
won
t
stand
the
strain
of
putting
that
the
girl
laughed
she
had
a
nice
laugh
thought
cynthia
still
slightly
resentful
of
the
interruption
then
followed
a
stream
of
fluent
french
addressed
to
the
model
mind
if
i
watch
she
asked
quietly
and
cynthia
again
intent
on
the
color
of
that
shadow
muttered
an
permission
thereafter
for
the
space
of
ten
minutes
there
was
peace
along
the
old
walls
of
carcassonne
swimming
in
the
golden
haze
of
afternoon
light
pigeons
circled
and
cooed
from
a
not
too
distant
watch
tower
came
the
nasal
drone
of
the
guide
explaining
how
just
here
the
black
prince
had
stormed
the
city
and
burned
the
tower
the
air
smelt
of
hot
dust
sleepiness
and
france
and
cynthia
s
busy
brush
flew
from
palette
to
sketch
and
back
again
finally
she
leaned
back
on
her
stool
squinted
at
the
sketch
with
her
head
on
one
side
then
looked
up
and
nodded
it
s
finished
i
guess
i
don
t
know
what
you
said
to
him
but
it
worked
like
a
charm
sorry
i
was
you
weren
t
rude
that
s
a
lovely
painting
and
a
good
likeness
too
you
re
american
aren
t
you
my
name
is
serena
grayson
from
new
only
she
said
o
lean
in
the
prettiest
manner
imaginable
i
guessed
it
grinned
cynthia
staying
in
the
lower
town
wait
till
i
pay
off
this
infant
and
we
ll
walk
down
i
should
wait
for
aunt
anna
the
girl
hesitated
look
here
let
me
have
a
piece
of
paper
from
your
sketch
book
will
you
i
ll
just
scribble
a
note
to
tell
her
that
i
ve
gone
on
she
is
shopping
in
the
cité
and
started
me
out
with
that
serena
made
a
little
face
of
dislike
i
thought
watching
you
would
be
more
fun
so
i
deserted
but
she
ll
be
looking
for
me
when
the
tour
is
cynthia
didn
t
say
anything
but
she
thought
it
was
strange
that
a
girl
fully
her
own
age
should
have
to
report
so
carefully
on
where
she
was
going
serena
dispatched
the
note
by
one
of
the
small
urchins
who
still
lingered
to
watch
the
fascinating
process
of
packing
up
the
paint
box
almost
any
of
them
was
eager
to
earn
an
extra
franc
though
i
hope
it
gets
delivered
remarked
serena
watching
the
small
boy
dubiously
as
he
scampered
off
perhaps
i
hadn
t
better
go
after
oh
come
along
it
s
just
to
the
lower
town
nothing
can
hurt
you
and
surely
your
aunt
won
t
care
why
i
go
all
over
france
do
you
almost
wistfully
the
way
out
of
the
ancient
walled
city
led
down
a
steep
little
cobbled
street
where
houses
leaned
their
heads
together
like
gossips
over
tea
cups
and
between
whose
stones
grasses
grew
and
the
shadows
of
the
late
afternoon
flung
a
welcome
coolness
then
out
past
the
tourney
court
where
once
gallant
knights
in
full
armor
had
fought
for
their
ladies
favor
and
past
the
porte
d
aude
which
looked
out
over
the
lower
and
newer
and
uglier
town
where
are
you
staying
asked
cynthia
glory
but
it
s
good
to
talk
to
an
american
again
it
s
been
weeks
since
i
have
been
able
she
hadn
t
quite
been
aware
how
much
she
had
missed
nancy
had
wished
that
chick
were
here
until
she
met
someone
from
home
it
is
jolly
to
speak
your
own
tongue
again
we
re
staying
at
the
chat
d
or
aunt
anna
and
myself
we
only
got
here
today
and
won
t
you
come
and
have
dinner
with
us
tonight
i
d
love
to
have
i
d
love
to
come
i
ve
been
here
nearly
a
week
now
and
it
s
worth
every
minute
you
can
spend
here
too
look
and
cynthia
clutched
the
other
s
arm
to
turn
her
attention
behind
them
above
the
road
they
had
descended
full
in
the
glow
of
the
late
sun
the
city
rose
golden
pale
against
the
southern
sky
turrets
and
towers
battlements
and
barbicans
dreaming
in
the
light
exactly
as
they
had
dreamed
for
the
past
six
hundred
years
and
more
lovely
murmured
the
other
starry
eyed
for
just
a
moment
cynthia
thought
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
as
well
as
stars
but
she
could
understand
that
cynthia
herself
often
felt
teary
when
something
was
too
beautiful
to
believe
they
took
up
this
matter
of
dinner
again
it
will
be
nice
to
eat
somewhere
else
neither
of
the
two
places
i
ve
tried
are
very
good
and
i
m
sick
of
the
boiled
veal
and
caramel
custard
at
the
cheval
blanc
said
cynthia
and
where
the
french
ever
got
the
idea
they
were
a
nation
of
born
cooks
i
know
where
your
hotel
is
suppose
i
run
home
now
my
road
goes
this
way
and
yours
to
the
left
then
i
ll
get
a
bath
and
into
a
clean
dress
and
be
at
your
place
when
about
seven
there
were
three
hotels
in
carcassonne
one
in
the
upper
cité
very
grand
and
quaint
and
with
the
grandest
quaintest
prices
too
and
two
in
the
lower
town
across
the
river
aude
cynthia
had
taken
a
room
at
the
station
hotel
which
was
the
first
one
she
saw
when
she
got
off
the
train
it
was
at
least
cheap
and
convenient
oh
yes
and
there
was
the
hotel
de
l
universe
hardly
worthy
of
the
name
of
a
hotel
but
displaying
its
grandiloquent
appellation
in
gilt
letters
two
feet
high
across
its
entire
three
room
frontage
cynthia
had
smiled
at
the
name
for
she
had
found
in
france
that
it
was
generally
the
smallest
places
that
bore
the
biggest
names
the
universe
looked
cozy
and
very
clean
and
she
had
even
thought
of
moving
her
suitcase
inside
its
hospitable
blue
door
but
had
been
too
busy
to
carry
out
the
thought
often
however
she
dined
there
and
tonight
as
she
crossed
the
square
and
passed
the
little
red
checked
gingham
curtains
and
the
green
painted
iron
tables
on
the
terrace
she
saw
the
american
boy
having
a
beer
on
the
terrace
just
as
she
had
seen
him
every
evening
since
she
came
she
smiled
and
waved
a
hand
at
him
and
he
very
nearly
smiled
in
return
cynthia
had
an
impulse
to
try
once
more
to
talk
to
him
as
she
had
tried
on
the
train
but
immediately
his
gaze
had
returned
morosely
to
the
long
lane
of
dusty
plane
trees
that
lined
the
street
oh
well
she
wasn
t
going
to
waste
her
time
picking
up
someone
who
evidently
didn
t
want
to
be
picked
up
but
when
you
travel
for
miles
and
miles
and
hours
and
hours
in
the
same
railway
coach
with
a
chap
and
you
know
he
s
a
fellow
countryman
and
hard
up
probably
like
you
are
just
look
at
the
clothes
he
wore
neat
but
not
any
product
of
park
avenue
and
when
there
s
scarcely
another
american
in
the
lower
town
not
at
least
until
today
why
it
would
seem
sort
of
pleasant
to
meet
once
or
twice
and
have
a
talk
cynthia
gave
a
little
skip
of
pleasure
and
forgot
the
boy
on
the
terrace
nice
to
have
a
dinner
date
nice
to
be
going
to
talk
good
old
united
states
for
an
evening
adventure
was
exciting
afterwards
but
it
was
pretty
dull
sometimes
while
it
was
happening
but
when
she
returned
along
the
narrow
little
street
past
the
hotel
de
l
universe
with
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
gilding
the
far
off
towers
of
the
upper
city
the
boy
was
still
sitting
on
the
terrace
cynthia
wondered
she
had
first
seen
him
at
toulouse
standing
on
the
platform
with
his
suitcase
in
his
hand
and
cynthia
leaning
out
of
the
window
to
buy
a
and
a
bottle
of
mineral
water
from
the
little
pushcart
like
a
giant
baby
carriage
that
peddles
lunches
on
all
the
train
platforms
in
france
noticed
his
very
american
shoes
she
always
played
little
games
with
herself
to
ward
off
boredom
and
by
this
time
considered
herself
quite
skillful
in
telling
even
norwegians
from
english
who
looked
so
much
like
them
this
boy
had
ascended
further
down
on
the
corridor
train
cynthia
was
riding
second
class
instead
of
third
for
it
was
a
long
trip
from
the
pyrenees
to
carcassonne
later
in
the
afternoon
she
noticed
him
in
the
very
next
compartment
and
still
later
passed
him
in
the
corridor
leaning
listlessly
against
the
long
window
the
last
time
before
carcassonne
she
noticed
him
on
the
platform
of
a
tiny
where
he
stopped
to
buy
a
flower
from
a
little
girl
and
for
the
first
time
he
smiled
cynthia
was
startled
at
that
smile
so
white
and
sudden
and
flashing
why
he
doesn
t
look
cross
and
unhappy
at
all
she
thought
somebody
ought
to
tell
him
to
smile
more
often
but
she
hadn
t
seen
him
smile
again
in
all
the
weeks
since
then
it
might
have
been
a
very
happy
evening
but
for
miss
comstock
serena
s
aunt
anna
she
was
a
pretty
plump
little
southerner
carefully
rouged
and
powdered
and
manicured
exquisitely
dressed
with
manners
as
sleek
as
the
fur
of
a
well
tended
cat
but
her
manners
didn
t
somehow
put
you
at
your
ease
they
just
made
you
feel
crude
and
ill
bred
by
contrast
miss
comstock
s
slow
drawl
even
more
pronouncedly
of
the
south
than
serena
s
was
as
purring
as
a
kitten
s
song
of
content
and
she
appeared
to
be
intensely
interested
in
all
her
guest
had
been
and
done
and
seen
the
hotel
was
much
more
pretentious
than
cynthia
s
humble
cheval
blanc
with
corridors
choked
with
palm
trees
and
hanging
baskets
with
delicious
food
and
with
a
great
yellow
cat
on
the
front
mat
attesting
to
the
excellence
of
the
cuisine
cynthia
thought
the
cat
s
smug
countenance
bore
a
fantastic
resemblance
to
serena
s
aunt
anna
but
she
wouldn
t
have
trusted
him
alone
with
a
canary
how
wonderful
to
be
an
artist
wonderful
to
do
as
you
like
with
your
life
no
cares
no
responsibilities
no
ties
gushed
aunt
anna
over
their
coffee
on
the
terrace
cynthia
rudely
thought
oh
yeah
and
remembered
the
cover
she
must
send
back
to
the
states
every
month
and
all
the
other
work
she
had
accomplished
in
europe
but
said
nothing
you
know
i
always
had
a
fancy
to
be
an
artist
but
once
i
had
an
artist
in
love
with
me
and
she
sighed
romantically
lots
of
people
in
love
with
you
auntie
murmured
serena
in
so
dutiful
a
tone
that
cynthia
wondered
how
many
hundred
times
she
had
made
the
same
remark
someone
was
playing
a
violin
in
the
café
across
the
street
the
lights
and
the
sound
of
voices
streamed
out
across
the
little
square
beyond
the
hotel
terrace
and
a
big
yellow
moon
swam
up
behind
the
plane
trees
the
streets
were
full
of
people
coming
and
going
for
tonight
was
saturday
when
all
the
town
felt
free
to
play
serena
had
gone
very
silent
since
her
last
remark
and
cynthia
in
spite
of
the
beauty
of
the
hour
was
beginning
to
feel
sleepy
and
finding
it
difficult
to
stifle
her
yawns
as
she
watched
the
shadow
silhouettes
of
people
passing
dark
against
the
café
lights
it
was
like
a
scene
in
a
play
some
of
the
characters
she
already
recognized
from
her
week
in
the
town
there
was
good
old
madame
brassard
who
kept
the
pastry
shop
down
by
the
river
leaning
plumply
on
the
arm
of
her
thin
gray
little
husband
and
both
in
spotless
black
as
befitted
a
gala
saturday
night
and
there
was
the
guide
from
the
carcassonne
walls
limping
on
his
cane
his
face
as
blankly
sweet
as
a
chromo
portrait
it
had
been
cynthia
knew
almost
entirely
shot
away
at
amiens
and
repaired
again
by
a
surgeon
who
had
almost
but
not
quite
repeated
the
charm
of
the
original
and
there
was
the
boy
from
the
other
terrace
slouching
slowly
hands
in
pockets
shoulders
hunched
disconsolately
some
day
perhaps
tomorrow
morning
she
would
certainly
cross
the
street
and
start
talking
to
him
aunt
anna
gave
a
faint
exclamation
and
leaned
forward
blinking
against
the
lights
oh
isn
t
that
but
no
of
course
not
how
foolish
of
me
she
gave
a
nervous
little
laugh
i
excuse
me
i
thought
i
recognized
someone
from
home
she
said
and
began
to
tell
cynthia
all
about
the
nice
man
in
the
shop
in
the
upper
town
who
was
keeping
a
lovely
silk
shawl
till
she
came
in
to
look
at
it
again
in
the
morning
serena
sitting
with
her
back
to
the
light
was
still
silent
cynthia
suddenly
jumped
to
her
feet
and
exclaimed
come
on
let
s
go
for
a
walk
up
to
the
walls
it
s
a
wonderful
night
to
see
them
and
it
s
perfectly
safe
there
will
be
lots
of
people
along
the
miss
comstock
glanced
swiftly
down
the
street
then
reached
out
to
pat
her
hand
you
yankee
girls
are
so
energetic
she
drawled
i
m
sure
serena
would
much
prefer
to
sit
right
here
and
listen
to
the
beautiful
but
it
seemed
serena
wouldn
t
she
too
was
on
her
feet
we
ll
just
go
a
little
way
aunt
anna
she
said
and
we
won
t
be
gone
long
come
on
yankee
gal
and
she
linked
her
arm
through
cynthia
s
she
laughed
and
talked
animatedly
for
the
next
block
or
two
but
when
they
came
out
of
the
new
town
and
faced
the
walls
of
the
ancient
fortress
all
green
and
dark
gold
under
the
moon
with
crickets
shrilling
from
the
banks
of
the
little
stream
and
the
lights
of
the
houses
behind
them
she
was
silent
again
let
s
not
go
any
farther
here
s
a
splendid
place
to
sit
suggested
cynthia
who
thought
the
other
might
be
rather
tired
and
had
found
a
seat
on
the
handrail
of
the
little
stone
bridge
one
could
hear
far
off
music
and
voices
sounding
faintly
and
contrary
to
expectations
the
road
was
almost
deserted
perhaps
the
old
town
had
little
romance
or
mystery
for
those
who
had
always
lived
within
sight
of
its
walls
but
she
must
make
conversation
this
wasn
t
being
a
good
guest
where
do
you
go
after
carcassonne
she
asked
politely
then
saw
with
astonishment
that
serena
was
crying
oh
don
t
do
that
cried
cynthia
distressed
look
here
you
aren
t
happy
can
t
you
tell
me
about
it
oh
i
hate
france
i
hate
europe
i
hate
this
town
worst
of
all
and
serena
suddenly
flopped
down
beside
cynthia
and
dropped
her
head
on
a
much
surprised
yankee
shoulder
i
want
to
go
ho
ome
i
want
to
go
ho
ome
is
it
just
homesickness
asked
cynthia
gently
she
certainly
knew
a
lot
about
that
feeling
since
she
came
abroad
but
serena
shook
her
head
then
started
to
wipe
her
eyes
no
forlornly
it
s
it
s
jack
oh
ah
yes
murmured
cynthia
vaguely
come
sit
up
and
tell
me
all
about
it
and
she
patted
the
other
s
back
reassuringly
she
had
heard
that
it
was
sometimes
easier
to
tell
your
troubles
to
a
stranger
serena
may
have
heard
that
too
for
she
said
it
s
aunt
anna
really
she
s
mother
s
oldest
sister
oh
i
know
she
doesn
t
look
it
but
she
s
always
had
money
and
can
afford
to
do
things
to
keep
young
and
buy
clothes
to
make
herself
pretty
and
i
guess
that
s
about
all
she
cares
about
anyway
i
guess
long
ago
she
was
in
love
with
jack
s
father
too
though
that
s
only
a
sort
of
jack
jack
hemstead
he
s
a
boy
from
home
as
though
that
were
sufficient
explanation
and
when
jack
jack
said
he
ca
cared
for
me
she
swallowed
waited
a
minute
and
went
on
aunt
anna
made
fun
of
him
and
said
it
was
all
foolishness
at
our
age
though
i
m
eighteen
and
jack
s
nearly
twenty
one
and
finally
she
said
she
d
take
me
abroad
for
the
summer
and
then
maybe
i
d
see
jack
wasn
t
so
marvelous
but
he
is
oh
he
s
the
most
marvelous
she
d
start
to
cry
again
if
cynthia
wasn
t
careful
but
haven
t
you
written
him
she
asked
serena
nodded
vigorously
yes
but
we
had
a
quarrel
just
before
i
left
he
said
if
i
really
cared
i
d
marry
him
then
even
if
we
weren
t
of
age
but
i
guess
maybe
i
wanted
the
trip
and
i
thought
i
could
have
jack
too
and
i
haven
t
heard
a
word
not
one
single
word
since
i
left
home
i
ve
written
and
written
begging
him
to
write
me
and
i
m
so
ashamed
something
s
wrong
somewhere
thought
cynthia
wondering
what
on
earth
she
could
do
about
it
tell
me
more
about
him
and
how
long
have
you
been
over
only
four
weeks
and
auntie
s
really
been
awfully
kind
in
her
own
way
she
s
bought
me
things
and
things
and
we
shopped
for
clothes
till
i
never
want
to
see
another
paris
label
again
i
hated
paris
then
aunt
decided
to
come
to
carcassonne
we
are
sailing
from
the
south
of
france
she
said
she
d
once
read
a
poem
about
it
but
you
re
the
first
young
person
i
ve
talked
to
since
we
left
home
on
the
boat
she
was
awfully
sick
and
wanted
to
be
read
to
all
the
time
so
i
just
stayed
in
the
cabin
with
her
i
was
so
grateful
for
the
trip
but
i
didn
t
know
jack
wasn
t
going
to
forgive
me
she
wailed
cynthia
looking
off
towards
the
walls
through
the
sweet
scented
moonlight
felt
very
sorry
for
this
little
southerner
but
it
all
seemed
too
remote
too
far
away
for
her
to
do
anything
to
help
with
jack
in
america
she
couldn
t
do
anything
more
than
lend
a
listening
ear
to
serena
and
try
to
cheer
her
up
as
much
as
possible
in
the
few
days
they
d
be
staying
here
serena
seemed
quite
content
with
that
quite
willing
in
the
days
that
followed
just
to
trail
along
with
a
book
or
a
bit
of
sewing
and
sit
not
too
far
off
while
cynthia
sketched
along
the
walls
of
the
old
city
she
proved
indeed
extremely
useful
her
fluent
french
was
a
prop
for
cynthia
s
faltering
accents
and
she
had
a
delightful
knack
with
persuading
the
children
to
pose
cynthia
made
three
excellent
portraits
any
one
of
which
would
do
for
her
monthly
cover
then
felt
free
to
give
her
time
to
sketching
the
town
itself
but
wherever
they
went
aunt
anna
either
hovered
in
the
background
or
knew
exactly
where
they
would
be
from
half
hour
to
half
hour
it
was
like
having
a
secret
service
man
always
in
the
offing
serena
didn
t
mind
but
cynthia
said
it
gave
her
the
creeps
always
to
have
miss
comstock
bobbing
up
like
a
cuckoo
out
of
a
clock
and
put
up
with
it
only
for
the
sake
of
the
other
girl
meanwhile
she
heard
more
about
this
jack
person
she
heard
about
the
color
of
his
eyes
and
of
his
hair
about
his
cleverness
and
about
his
family
and
about
his
job
which
was
at
the
moment
junior
clerk
very
junior
indeed
in
a
big
real
estate
office
in
new
orleans
he
s
got
the
nicest
smile
you
d
think
he
was
cross
really
until
he
smiles
and
then
it
sort
of
flashes
across
his
face
expatiated
serena
they
had
been
sitting
for
the
past
hour
in
the
tourney
court
trying
to
reconstruct
the
ancient
court
of
beauty
with
its
lists
the
ground
enclosed
for
the
contest
its
seats
for
the
great
ladies
from
which
the
queen
of
beauty
was
chosen
i
wonder
if
they
called
her
miss
carcassonne
or
miss
france
murmured
cynthia
to
herself
all
was
quiet
here
one
could
follow
on
the
ancient
walls
the
reconstruction
of
centuries
the
lower
bricks
of
roman
tile
small
and
flat
the
higher
coarser
stone
of
the
tenth
century
then
above
that
still
more
careful
work
of
later
years
and
finally
the
deliberately
antiqued
and
weathered
rebuilding
of
the
great
without
whose
interest
and
wealth
this
greatest
relic
of
the
middle
ages
would
not
exist
today
birds
wheeled
in
the
sunlight
above
them
but
the
shadow
of
the
wall
was
cool
and
the
small
herd
of
tourists
whose
voices
sounded
from
the
tower
above
them
scarcely
left
a
ripple
on
the
peace
of
the
afternoon
i
love
this
place
murmured
cynthia
splashing
happily
in
rich
blue
shadow
color
but
she
frowned
a
little
something
serena
had
said
a
moment
back
had
started
her
memory
working
she
didn
t
really
want
it
to
work
she
wanted
to
stay
here
and
finish
her
sketch
that
was
it
though
it
sort
of
flashes
across
his
face
this
place
gives
me
the
shivers
serena
remarked
crossly
i
guess
it
s
because
it
s
so
full
of
romance
and
i
i
feel
so
empty
of
suddenly
cynthia
jumped
off
the
wall
and
began
to
gather
up
her
painting
materials
she
had
remembered
what
she
wanted
to
remember
it
was
just
a
chance
the
wildest
chance
possible
but
she
had
to
know
for
sure
i
m
going
back
to
the
hotel
she
said
you
stay
here
serena
but
i
d
like
it
if
you
could
come
along
in
a
couple
of
hours
and
have
tea
with
me
french
tea
is
terrible
of
course
but
we
can
order
citron
pressé
i
may
have
something
to
show
you
just
me
without
auntie
asked
serena
cynthia
nodded
try
for
pete
s
sake
to
get
her
into
a
shop
for
an
hour
or
two
or
tell
her
it
s
time
she
took
the
tour
around
the
walls
she
might
enjoy
the
guide
he
was
very
handsome
once
she
added
maliciously
but
do
come
without
i
ll
try
i
ve
got
to
stay
here
and
wait
for
her
anyway
she
said
she
d
be
along
about
two
o
clock
and
it
s
only
half
past
and
her
puzzled
dark
gaze
followed
cynthia
down
the
steep
steps
to
the
court
across
it
through
the
high
pointed
arch
of
the
gate
and
long
afterwards
as
she
appeared
again
on
the
dusty
stretch
of
sunlit
road
to
the
lower
town
cynthia
had
suddenly
remembered
that
boy
at
the
hotel
de
l
universe
and
how
flashing
his
smile
had
been
that
one
time
she
had
seen
it
but
he
hadn
t
even
appeared
on
the
terrace
for
the
past
two
days
perhaps
he
had
left
carcassonne
entirely
and
almost
certainly
he
had
no
least
connection
with
serena
s
jack
but
he
had
looked
so
forlorn
and
somehow
he
had
looked
southern
too
cynthia
s
ardent
desire
to
be
again
a
little
miss
fixit
almost
persuaded
her
she
could
tell
a
yankee
from
a
louisianian
even
before
he
had
said
a
single
word
she
d
ask
at
the
hotel
for
the
young
american
with
the
brown
eyes
and
if
he
were
still
registered
there
she
d
leave
a
note
inviting
him
to
join
her
for
tea
this
afternoon
anyway
it
might
be
rather
fun
even
if
nothing
came
of
it
serena
was
on
time
and
cynthia
suggested
that
the
hotel
de
l
universe
looked
more
amusing
than
the
terrace
of
her
own
hotel
and
i
d
like
to
try
a
grenadine
it
s
such
a
pretty
color
she
announced
once
settled
at
the
green
painted
table
so
they
each
had
one
of
the
sickly
pink
syrups
so
beloved
of
the
french
and
sat
sipping
contentedly
while
they
gazed
out
across
the
low
hedge
of
dusty
box
that
separated
the
terrace
from
the
street
then
cynthia
who
was
watching
her
companion
saw
her
grab
the
edge
of
the
table
and
go
almost
white
i
was
right
i
was
right
thought
cynthia
oh
golly
gasped
the
other
wildly
who
who
s
that
a
tall
figure
was
lounging
down
the
street
coming
swiftly
towards
them
then
he
had
got
cynthia
s
little
note
and
had
come
almost
as
though
he
had
guessed
what
it
was
about
the
next
happened
so
suddenly
that
cynthia
could
scarcely
untangle
it
all
a
very
flushed
happily
laughing
serena
different
from
any
serena
cynthia
had
yet
seen
standing
in
the
entrance
to
the
street
then
tearing
wildly
towards
the
approaching
boy
a
meeting
of
the
two
no
doubt
about
its
being
the
right
jack
and
the
amused
delighted
proprietor
beaming
in
the
doorway
after
all
this
was
carcassonne
and
it
was
france
where
else
in
the
world
would
one
expect
to
find
romance
if
not
here
but
how
did
you
guess
how
did
you
guess
asked
serena
as
introductions
properly
over
they
sat
again
at
the
little
green
table
jack
had
placed
his
straw
hat
and
the
tauchniz
book
he
had
been
carrying
on
the
next
table
had
ordered
a
beer
but
had
made
no
move
to
consume
it
for
his
attention
was
too
occupied
with
serena
oh
we
traveled
together
once
upon
a
time
began
cynthia
but
immediately
saw
that
neither
of
her
listeners
was
giving
her
the
slightest
attention
wisest
to
slip
away
and
stand
guard
outside
i
ll
give
you
a
half
hour
together
she
said
firmly
but
if
i
give
an
alarm
you
ve
got
to
scoot
better
get
busy
and
make
your
plans
may
i
borrow
this
and
picking
up
the
little
tauchnitz
paper
covered
volume
she
nodded
and
went
out
through
the
dusty
hedge
all
this
was
making
her
feel
pretty
blue
herself
chick
also
might
have
been
here
today
with
a
bit
of
luck
but
chick
was
a
very
satisfying
person
he
at
least
wrote
letters
and
fat
ones
too
she
had
had
one
this
morning
and
while
she
waited
would
be
a
good
time
to
read
it
again
for
the
third
time
that
finished
she
found
a
seat
beneath
the
plane
trees
and
turned
to
the
book
she
had
picked
up
a
volume
of
conrad
s
sea
stories
with
sprawled
in
large
plain
hand
across
the
cover
she
gave
the
couple
minutes
then
fearing
that
miss
comstock
who
of
course
knew
where
serena
had
gone
for
the
afternoon
might
happen
along
cynthia
got
up
and
briskly
returned
to
the
terrace
serena
s
head
was
close
to
jack
s
tumbled
locks
and
cynthia
was
amused
to
note
that
their
warming
drinks
stood
in
the
glasses
just
at
the
height
they
had
been
when
she
left
them
well
children
what
s
the
plans
she
asked
pulling
out
her
chair
again
we
re
going
to
be
serena
s
eyes
were
like
stars
jack
was
twenty
one
last
month
and
he
came
over
on
a
cattle
boat
wasn
t
that
brave
of
him
he
got
a
big
commission
big
for
a
beginner
that
is
for
selling
a
business
plot
in
the
city
so
he
decided
to
trail
us
over
here
and
see
what
was
wrong
he
found
out
our
address
from
the
hotel
in
paris
i
ve
got
a
first
class
ticket
home
and
jack
has
a
third
class
he
thinks
we
can
trade
them
in
for
two
second
class
my
ticket
s
my
own
because
mother
paid
for
that
not
aunt
the
american
consul
at
marseilles
can
marry
us
jack
told
cynthia
i
can
t
tell
you
how
grateful
we
are
for
arranging
this
serena
hasn
t
been
getting
any
of
my
your
aunt
cynthia
s
eyebrows
were
questioning
and
serena
nodded
and
shrugged
it
s
all
right
now
but
we
can
t
give
her
another
chance
to
mess
things
up
for
us
jack
thinks
we
had
better
get
away
on
the
tonight
but
i
don
t
see
how
i
can
get
away
before
tomorrow
not
without
an
awful
you
ve
got
to
said
jack
firmly
already
playing
the
heavy
husband
this
is
one
time
when
you
ll
have
to
put
on
some
yankee
pep
your
aunt
knows
i
m
here
or
at
least
that
i
was
here
for
over
a
gasped
serena
and
even
cynthia
was
astonished
yes
she
saw
me
one
evening
when
i
was
strolling
about
the
streets
here
that
was
let
s
see
about
five
days
the
night
serena
talked
to
me
on
the
bridge
thought
cynthia
that
s
so
he
passed
the
café
where
the
lights
were
so
bright
so
a
couple
of
days
later
she
hunted
me
up
at
the
hotel
she
said
she
had
no
intention
of
my
seeing
her
niece
and
of
making
her
unhappy
all
over
again
and
that
serena
s
not
writing
was
proof
enough
that
she
was
through
caring
for
me
that
sort
of
set
me
thinking
for
how
could
she
be
sure
that
serena
wasn
t
really
writing
to
me
unless
she
herself
was
doing
something
about
but
i
did
write
jack
two
letters
every
week
protested
the
indignant
serena
yes
i
know
honey
child
but
your
aunt
was
very
careful
that
they
didn
t
get
mailed
or
that
you
didn
t
get
mine
either
so
i
let
her
come
down
to
the
station
to
see
me
off
she
was
most
gracious
having
won
her
point
she
saw
me
buy
a
ticket
for
marseilles
and
get
on
the
express
but
she
didn
t
know
that
it
stops
again
about
a
half
hour
beyond
here
and
that
i
got
off
there
and
returned
by
the
next
train
i
ve
been
very
careful
ever
since
to
keep
out
of
sight
as
much
as
possible
but
i
d
seen
you
two
together
so
when
i
got
miss
wanstead
s
note
i
suspected
that
she
had
arranged
oh
jack
and
i
never
guessed
you
were
in
carcassonne
all
this
for
a
long
moment
then
they
forgot
all
about
cynthia
till
in
protest
that
young
lady
remarked
hadn
t
we
better
get
on
with
those
plans
of
yours
so
for
fifteen
more
minutes
plans
were
made
rejected
and
reaccepted
till
cynthia
looking
up
suddenly
exclaimed
and
here
comes
your
aunt
tripping
gaily
down
the
street
on
the
arm
of
the
little
blesse
parasol
unfurled
eyes
upcast
in
characteristic
admiring
pose
came
miss
comstock
run
jack
gasped
serena
she
mustn
t
see
you
and
there
was
a
scramble
for
the
doorway
a
hasty
return
for
the
straw
hat
and
at
the
last
minute
cynthia
reached
out
to
switch
the
untasted
beer
to
another
table
as
though
a
departing
customer
had
left
it
there
but
it
was
a
close
shave
aunt
anna
was
full
of
the
sights
she
had
seen
the
new
bargains
she
had
procured
of
the
delightful
little
soldier
who
had
showed
her
around
but
her
eyes
were
keen
and
cynthia
knew
she
did
not
miss
that
beer
at
the
next
table
then
cynthia
did
a
clumsy
thing
she
dropped
the
volume
of
conrad
for
just
a
moment
it
lay
face
upward
on
the
floor
the
sprawling
signature
showing
plainly
across
its
cover
cynthia
bent
to
grab
it
hastily
flapped
it
on
top
her
purse
she
rose
immediately
to
go
she
couldn
t
risk
the
fact
that
miss
comstock
might
have
glimpsed
that
name
the
next
two
hours
were
merely
a
matter
of
waiting
serena
and
her
aunt
usually
dined
at
eight
and
cynthia
cautiously
strolling
along
the
street
which
commanded
serena
s
bedroom
window
watched
for
the
agreed
signal
a
handkerchief
pasted
against
the
pane
as
though
put
there
for
drying
she
waited
five
minutes
more
then
slipped
upstairs
repeating
to
herself
the
story
she
would
tell
if
any
one
tried
to
stop
her
but
no
one
did
serena
s
hung
in
trusting
european
fashion
on
a
high
nail
beside
her
door
cynthia
took
it
down
glanced
once
again
along
the
corridor
thought
she
heard
footsteps
and
hastily
turned
the
key
inside
serena
s
bag
already
packed
had
been
slid
beneath
her
bed
her
traveling
coat
and
hat
her
street
shoes
were
with
it
cynthia
grabbed
the
lot
and
opened
the
door
again
then
came
a
moment
of
fright
for
the
maid
agnés
stood
just
outside
in
the
corridor
but
she
was
wreathed
in
smiles
already
primed
by
serena
for
the
the
elopement
and
her
ancient
romantic
heart
was
in
the
job
she
piloted
cynthia
along
the
corridor
and
down
the
servant
s
stairway
then
out
through
an
alley
behind
the
garage
put
her
finger
to
her
lips
as
a
vow
of
silence
then
blew
a
kiss
into
the
air
as
a
gesture
of
her
best
wishes
for
the
bride
and
groom
no
word
between
them
had
been
passed
during
the
whole
four
minutes
of
action
cynthia
giggling
was
on
her
way
this
was
certainly
something
to
write
home
about
the
remainder
worked
like
a
charm
a
charm
of
ancient
carcassonne
where
even
in
the
tenth
century
young
ladies
must
have
fled
with
their
heart
s
desire
at
nine
o
clock
the
for
marseilles
stopped
for
five
minutes
at
the
tiny
station
at
nine
minutes
to
nine
jack
with
his
suitcase
cynthia
with
serena
s
belongings
and
a
bunch
of
flowers
for
the
watched
anxiously
down
the
street
then
against
the
sunset
appeared
serena
breathless
with
dusty
evening
slippers
still
in
her
dinner
gown
but
happy
and
incoherent
with
excitement
oh
you
treasures
both
of
you
she
cried
have
we
tickets
goodness
there
s
the
train
already
she
thinks
i
m
out
buying
some
aspirin
tablets
i
didn
t
have
time
to
leave
a
note
on
the
pincushion
my
lamb
will
you
tell
her
i
ve
gone
and
rattled
on
and
on
while
they
climbed
into
the
compartment
cynthia
kept
one
anxious
eye
on
the
door
she
didn
t
know
what
would
be
the
proper
procedure
should
aunt
anna
appear
at
the
station
with
the
fire
of
suspicion
in
her
eye
cynthia
had
a
wild
momentary
vision
of
herself
grabbing
the
woman
around
her
ample
waist
and
hanging
on
until
the
train
could
have
pulled
out
but
no
one
appeared
the
conductor
blew
his
little
toy
trumpet
shouted
the
usual
warning
and
at
the
last
minute
cynthia
still
clasping
the
bridal
bouquet
had
to
run
beside
the
carriage
to
fling
it
through
the
window
she
had
a
final
glimpse
of
serena
s
starry
eyes
of
jack
s
white
smile
then
silence
nothing
cynthia
came
out
of
the
station
door
to
the
deserted
cobble
street
and
twilight
i
wish
it
had
happened
to
me
she
thought
a
little
mournfully
but
maybe
it
will
soon
and
had
no
idea
how
very
soon
that
would
be
the
moon
hung
like
a
burnished
platter
above
the
romantic
old
town
too
beautiful
too
unreal
to
be
true
well
thought
cynthia
going
practical
all
of
a
sudden
i
guess
somebody
s
got
to
break
the
news
to
auntie
and
started
down
the
street
toward
the
hotel
of
miss
comstock
chapter
the
racing
snail
then
at
marseilles
where
cynthia
had
planned
to
take
train
for
paris
for
cherbourg
and
a
ship
for
home
she
caught
up
with
her
mail
one
specially
fat
and
formidable
envelope
with
many
seals
for
which
she
had
to
sign
papers
and
more
papers
proved
to
contain
of
all
things
the
long
deferred
check
for
the
capture
of
goncourt
the
jewel
thief
cynthia
in
the
office
of
cook
and
sons
stood
surveying
the
paper
with
bright
round
eyes
so
many
francs
one
thought
in
francs
now
not
in
dollars
would
purchase
what
presents
for
home
her
luggage
was
already
heavy
with
em
more
clothes
in
paris
she
had
really
all
she
needed
a
trip
to
some
place
farther
on
cynthia
nibbled
a
pink
finger
tip
and
thought
about
that
maybe
never
again
after
this
once
would
she
get
to
europe
maybe
she
d
be
some
day
a
long
time
off
one
of
those
little
old
ladies
with
shawls
who
sit
in
corners
well
out
of
the
draft
and
talk
with
wistful
reminiscence
of
when
i
was
in
france
when
i
was
in
meaning
of
course
the
time
they
were
there
perhaps
that
wouldn
t
be
true
perhaps
she
d
come
again
in
a
year
or
two
but
just
the
same
she
owed
it
to
herself
to
get
all
she
could
out
of
this
adventure
while
she
was
right
here
on
the
spot
the
thief
had
proved
to
be
just
so
many
extra
francs
dropped
by
the
gods
directly
into
her
lap
shouldn
t
she
therefore
take
it
for
a
sign
cable
home
that
she
was
waiting
for
a
later
boat
and
go
on
with
the
adventure
when
i
was
in
italy
the
rhythm
returned
cynthia
whirled
to
face
the
surprised
young
man
behind
the
counter
if
you
had
a
windfall
of
so
many
hundred
or
thousand
francs
she
asked
him
where
would
you
go
from
here
the
young
man
grinned
cheerfully
and
replied
in
meticulous
english
madmoiselle
i
should
go
to
bon
cynthia
was
enchanted
that
his
advice
should
agree
with
her
mental
toss
of
a
coin
and
where
in
italy
please
the
young
man
grinned
more
widely
and
shuffled
the
papers
on
his
counter
here
then
was
a
customer
for
the
tickets
he
had
to
sell
madmoiselle
i
should
go
to
the
palio
in
siena
it
is
the
month
for
that
madmoiselle
has
heard
of
the
palio
non
oh
but
then
and
he
proceeded
to
expound
twenty
minutes
later
cynthia
walking
on
air
emerged
from
cook
and
sons
in
her
purse
reposed
a
ticket
for
italy
and
the
palio
in
siena
would
be
one
of
those
things
she
could
talk
of
once
she
got
to
the
age
of
relating
when
i
was
in
five
days
later
cynthia
in
siena
pressed
her
small
tip
tilted
nose
flat
against
the
glass
of
the
dusty
window
peering
in
she
had
come
again
for
the
third
time
today
to
see
the
frame
the
lovely
leather
frame
was
right
in
the
foreground
propped
against
the
glass
just
as
it
had
been
yesterday
and
probably
for
weeks
and
weeks
before
that
beside
it
lay
other
leather
things
cigarette
cases
glove
boxes
and
portfolios
all
beautiful
but
it
was
the
frame
that
interested
cynthia
it
was
the
one
frame
in
all
siena
which
after
all
is
a
city
of
leather
frames
for
the
photograph
of
chick
which
she
had
received
in
the
mail
in
marseilles
and
nothing
short
of
perfection
was
worthy
of
holding
that
picture
in
it
the
face
of
chick
squarely
fronted
the
beholder
the
hair
of
chick
was
fluffy
and
rumpled
as
it
had
been
when
the
academy
bunch
had
given
him
his
nickname
the
eyes
looked
straight
and
truly
into
the
eyes
of
cynthia
and
the
quirky
mouth
seemed
just
about
to
say
hi
cynthia
darling
the
frame
was
wine
colored
the
leather
as
soft
as
old
satin
and
all
around
its
edge
was
a
delicate
gold
border
of
conventional
ivy
leaves
with
next
to
it
a
band
of
oak
leaves
and
tiny
acorns
and
inside
next
to
the
glass
a
tiny
frail
beading
all
very
simple
but
it
was
the
color
and
the
workmanship
that
held
cynthia
s
eye
she
sighed
she
knew
to
a
lira
just
exactly
what
was
in
her
purse
knew
that
she
mustn
t
afford
the
frame
no
matter
how
low
the
price
might
be
nevertheless
she
pushed
open
the
paint
scarred
old
door
in
the
stone
housefront
and
entered
the
little
shop
it
was
as
she
had
expected
dim
and
dusty
within
the
proprietor
an
aged
little
italian
with
the
nose
of
one
who
works
in
delicate
detail
was
busy
with
another
customer
she
also
was
an
american
small
and
dainty
expensively
clad
older
than
she
appeared
cynthia
smiled
to
herself
after
two
months
in
europe
she
knew
the
type
very
well
too
much
too
much
she
was
saying
in
italian
over
and
over
again
and
gestured
prettily
with
a
gloved
hand
toward
a
small
pile
of
cigarette
cases
lying
on
the
counter
unexpectedly
then
she
turned
to
cynthia
you
look
as
though
you
could
speak
italian
my
dear
do
ask
him
if
he
will
give
me
a
better
price
for
the
whole
dozen
i
want
them
for
bridge
prizes
next
cynthia
was
willing
to
try
and
struggled
with
her
scant
store
of
the
language
the
proprietor
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
spread
expressive
italian
fingers
wide
yes
yes
eight
ten
lira
less
perhaps
he
smiled
and
cynthia
knew
that
all
along
he
had
expected
to
take
less
than
his
original
price
but
the
pretty
lady
was
pleased
wrap
them
up
she
ordered
the
man
in
the
loud
tone
so
often
employed
to
the
foreigner
who
seems
not
to
understand
as
though
by
mere
volume
of
sound
one
could
impress
one
s
meaning
cynthia
had
removed
the
lovely
frame
from
the
window
and
now
held
it
in
her
hand
close
like
this
it
was
even
more
beautiful
than
when
viewed
through
the
wavering
old
glass
and
at
cynthia
s
how
much
the
old
man
smiled
almost
fondly
as
though
he
too
knew
this
for
one
of
his
best
pieces
he
named
the
sum
in
lire
and
cynthia
made
a
rapid
calculation
then
with
a
sigh
shook
her
head
and
turned
to
replace
it
in
the
window
he
might
as
well
have
said
fifteen
hundred
dollars
as
fifteen
why
in
her
tiny
room
in
the
she
could
live
for
two
whole
weeks
on
fifteen
dollars
chick
would
have
to
wait
unframed
till
she
returned
to
the
states
and
a
steady
job
the
american
lady
was
still
fussing
over
the
wrapping
of
her
package
when
cynthia
left
the
shop
and
stepped
out
into
the
street
again
one
of
those
steep
streets
of
siena
that
seemed
to
bear
always
in
their
sunny
stone
the
tinge
of
a
perpetual
sunset
glow
from
far
down
the
street
came
the
roll
of
a
drum
and
cynthia
who
had
already
seen
two
of
these
rehearsals
pelted
off
as
fast
as
rubber
soles
on
cobbles
could
carry
her
never
mind
the
frame
though
she
gave
it
a
regretful
relinquishing
thought
tomorrow
was
the
palio
the
famous
horse
race
with
which
siena
twice
a
year
for
the
past
four
hundred
years
has
celebrated
her
liberation
from
the
long
arm
of
her
tyrant
neighbor
florence
and
now
for
the
past
three
days
siena
had
fallen
back
body
and
spirit
into
the
fifteenth
century
certainly
cynthia
rounding
the
corner
of
the
narrow
street
felt
as
though
she
had
been
projected
feet
first
into
a
slice
of
the
middle
ages
banners
of
silk
and
of
satin
of
tapestry
and
of
heavy
velvet
fringed
and
tasseled
in
gold
embroidered
with
the
arms
of
some
ancient
family
hung
from
a
high
balcony
and
above
it
glowing
in
the
warm
stone
was
carved
again
the
heraldic
device
below
the
slow
swaying
banners
stood
a
little
band
of
siennese
two
drummerboys
in
and
doublets
peaked
caps
over
their
frizzy
locks
their
companions
two
all
in
black
and
white
and
gold
the
flags
displayed
the
arms
of
their
or
ward
this
one
lupa
the
wolf
and
their
huge
ruffled
sleeves
and
the
little
purses
which
dangled
from
their
belts
were
embroidered
in
fine
gold
with
a
similar
device
the
drums
tapped
out
a
strange
intriguing
little
rhythm
while
the
two
banner
bearers
practising
their
rite
did
a
sort
of
solemn
dance
with
the
great
five
foot
square
flags
the
object
seemed
to
be
to
keep
up
a
continual
stepping
with
the
banners
never
for
one
moment
allowed
to
lag
under
the
arms
and
up
again
out
and
beneath
the
dancing
feet
and
the
drums
always
beating
faster
and
faster
fascinated
cynthia
watched
for
the
culmination
which
she
knew
would
come
with
a
final
roll
of
the
drums
the
banners
were
flung
high
high
almost
incredibly
to
the
tops
of
the
houses
then
descending
their
heavy
sticks
acting
as
weights
were
caught
lightly
and
skillfully
and
the
dance
for
the
moment
was
over
there
was
a
slight
cheer
from
the
small
group
that
had
gathered
to
watch
and
a
voice
behind
her
said
gosh
that
was
great
it
was
such
a
shock
to
hear
in
this
scene
of
the
past
a
good
american
voice
that
cynthia
whirled
involuntarily
to
face
the
speaker
to
her
surprise
he
was
all
of
fifty
with
the
reddish
complexion
of
a
confirmed
golf
player
a
shock
of
nice
thick
white
hair
gray
tweeds
the
expensive
kind
and
a
panama
hat
which
he
wore
in
his
hand
cynthia
met
his
smile
with
one
as
friendly
it
is
nice
isn
t
it
she
said
for
no
particular
reason
except
that
one
so
often
does
speak
to
fellow
americans
on
foreign
soil
then
she
started
to
turn
away
they
re
having
a
in
the
piazza
del
campo
this
morning
he
informed
her
perhaps
you
d
like
to
see
that
too
oh
are
they
thank
you
said
cynthia
and
this
time
she
really
did
turn
away
she
had
already
seen
one
of
the
the
rehearsal
for
the
big
race
and
thought
she
d
prefer
instead
of
seeing
this
one
to
find
a
place
to
sketch
with
her
final
cover
off
to
america
she
was
free
now
to
sketch
wherever
she
pleased
and
she
had
an
idea
that
she
might
work
up
material
for
an
exhibition
back
in
new
york
the
heads
to
be
her
main
attraction
but
perhaps
a
few
landscapes
to
add
a
little
variety
to
the
show
that
afternoon
she
saw
the
man
again
she
had
taken
her
sketch
box
and
camp
stool
and
having
hired
a
tiny
barouche
was
set
down
about
two
miles
out
of
siena
where
a
little
old
monastery
sat
atop
a
tall
hill
here
among
the
cypresses
she
could
sketch
for
an
hour
or
two
or
three
nibble
her
apple
and
sandwiches
and
in
the
cool
of
later
afternoon
pack
her
box
and
walk
back
to
town
cynthia
had
chosen
a
shady
angle
of
the
wall
and
had
roughed
in
her
drawing
a
bit
of
a
gateway
tiled
in
warm
red
and
a
tall
niche
where
stood
a
della
robbia
madonna
robed
in
blue
as
deep
as
the
italian
sky
bougainvillea
spilled
in
a
fountain
of
magenta
over
the
wall
and
cynthia
was
struggling
with
this
riot
of
color
when
she
heard
the
of
horses
hoofs
but
did
not
look
up
color
dried
so
swiftly
in
this
warm
dry
air
one
had
no
time
for
distractions
then
there
were
voices
two
a
man
s
and
a
woman
s
the
feminine
voice
light
pleasant
but
pitched
to
a
note
of
amused
complaint
that
was
vaguely
familiar
cynthia
could
not
help
overhearing
why
on
earth
you
had
to
drag
me
way
out
here
gerald
oh
of
course
the
road
was
lovely
but
we
have
so
little
time
in
siena
and
i
did
want
to
get
in
some
more
shopping
shopping
always
shopping
don
t
you
get
enough
shops
in
the
states
replied
the
man
s
voice
in
very
husbandly
tones
now
gerald
you
remember
i
didn
t
really
want
to
come
to
siena
in
the
first
place
but
then
of
course
i
had
no
idea
the
leather
and
the
iron
work
was
so
lovely
leather
that
was
it
the
woman
who
had
bought
the
cigarette
boxes
this
morning
and
the
man
with
her
cynthia
wiping
her
brush
on
her
white
skirt
said
a
faint
darn
for
the
color
was
rose
madder
and
probably
would
stain
peered
out
from
behind
her
wall
the
man
was
her
nice
gray
haired
acquaintance
well
his
trip
to
the
monastery
was
no
business
of
hers
now
how
to
get
that
tone
of
sunlight
between
the
deep
ah
that
did
it
intent
on
the
success
of
a
trick
of
the
trade
cynthia
forgot
the
voices
and
when
she
came
out
of
her
corner
an
hour
later
there
was
no
one
native
or
american
in
sight
cynthia
took
the
two
mile
walk
home
through
a
lemon
tinted
sunset
ran
into
another
flag
rehearsal
just
at
the
edge
of
the
town
and
enjoyed
it
hugely
so
pervasive
and
insistent
was
the
tap
tap
tr
tap
tap
of
the
drums
that
she
seemed
that
night
to
dream
about
them
all
night
long
and
she
woke
the
next
morning
with
the
distant
dream
patter
of
the
rhythm
still
tapping
merrily
through
her
head
in
the
pale
light
of
early
morning
the
sound
was
so
real
she
could
not
banish
it
with
the
remainder
of
her
doze
and
finally
hopped
out
of
bed
to
see
if
she
had
been
hearing
the
reality
sure
enough
just
down
the
street
the
were
practicing
their
strange
little
steps
and
the
first
rays
of
sunlight
over
the
housetops
caught
the
gilded
tips
of
the
banner
staves
as
they
were
flung
in
the
final
flourish
of
the
dance
to
the
house
tops
cynthia
remembered
the
fourteenth
of
july
celebration
in
paris
and
grinned
to
herself
she
was
prepared
now
for
such
festive
spirits
besides
that
and
all
reports
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
the
italians
didn
t
seem
to
put
so
much
noise
into
their
celebrations
as
their
french
neighbors
but
then
they
let
off
more
steam
in
just
living
when
she
had
finished
her
brief
and
early
breakfast
and
emerged
to
the
street
she
saw
that
this
was
truly
and
a
gala
day
the
steep
cobbled
way
to
the
cathedral
which
crowned
the
hill
was
like
an
illustration
clipped
from
her
morte
d
arthur
a
street
made
ready
for
the
entrance
of
a
lancelot
or
a
king
banners
of
silk
and
banners
of
velvet
cloth
of
gold
and
cloth
of
silver
all
embroidered
with
the
arms
of
siena
and
her
ruling
houses
and
so
far
as
cynthia
knew
of
mussolini
himself
hung
from
every
upper
window
and
balcony
fluttering
in
the
morning
breeze
with
a
constant
play
of
color
and
pageantry
along
the
gay
little
street
every
doorway
held
smiling
faces
above
the
garments
of
this
holiday
mood
every
child
carried
a
brilliant
hued
balloon
or
a
whistle
or
a
small
flag
and
down
around
the
where
the
race
was
to
be
run
the
side
streets
were
crowded
with
tiny
bright
colored
booths
peddling
those
cheap
and
sticky
indigestibles
that
go
with
a
holiday
all
the
world
over
cynthia
wanted
very
much
to
see
the
ceremony
of
blessing
the
horses
that
were
to
run
in
the
race
only
ten
of
the
seventeen
wards
might
compete
due
to
the
tiny
race
course
and
these
would
be
chosen
by
lot
just
before
the
race
began
each
horse
would
be
in
the
little
chapel
of
its
own
so
cynthia
chose
the
snail
since
that
of
all
the
ward
names
seemed
to
appeal
to
her
most
it
was
so
delightfully
silly
for
a
snail
to
be
running
a
race
even
by
proxy
the
chapel
was
a
plain
little
building
of
warm
stone
hidden
in
the
lower
edges
of
the
walled
town
and
the
room
was
already
crowded
with
interested
and
loyal
snailists
including
the
horse
who
seemed
the
most
interested
of
all
cynthia
listened
with
delight
to
the
sonorous
latin
phrases
of
the
little
priest
but
almost
burst
into
giggles
at
the
horse
s
astonished
expression
when
his
nose
was
sprinkled
with
water
from
a
kind
of
overgrown
silver
pepper
box
it
was
an
emotional
relief
when
she
caught
a
glance
from
an
amused
gray
eye
twinkling
over
the
heads
of
the
shorter
sienese
and
automatically
she
twinkled
back
at
it
then
she
saw
a
tuft
of
stiff
white
hair
and
recognized
her
acquaintance
of
the
day
before
cynthia
flushed
and
bit
her
lip
when
she
looked
again
he
was
gone
behind
the
chapel
was
a
room
used
for
exhibition
purposes
here
in
the
dim
glass
cases
dusty
with
age
were
the
ancient
costumes
worn
in
past
palios
by
the
jockeys
of
the
snail
many
of
them
were
hundreds
of
years
old
and
all
displayed
the
same
careful
craftsmanship
the
same
loving
care
for
detail
that
cynthia
had
noted
in
the
costumes
she
had
seen
on
the
streets
she
made
some
sketches
in
her
notebook
and
went
back
to
the
by
way
of
the
leather
shop
to
have
another
look
at
the
frame
in
the
window
back
in
her
room
she
emptied
her
pocketbook
on
the
bed
and
counted
her
express
checks
and
lire
but
the
frame
was
hopeless
she
just
couldn
t
manage
it
not
even
if
she
asked
the
shop
keeper
to
come
down
in
his
price
the
price
was
fair
cynthia
felt
that
it
was
even
more
than
that
and
one
couldn
t
ask
a
fellow
artist
to
cheapen
his
wares
i
m
afraid
chick
darling
she
told
the
photograph
propped
between
the
mirror
and
the
hair
brush
you
ll
just
have
to
go
as
you
are
maybe
a
little
later
for
the
future
looked
very
bright
indeed
cynthia
had
already
received
two
letters
from
advertising
firms
who
were
interested
in
her
covers
on
one
s
and
she
had
an
idea
for
a
new
series
for
that
same
publication
once
she
was
back
in
the
states
but
at
the
moment
in
a
strange
country
with
no
friend
nearer
than
nancy
and
her
mother
in
brittany
cynthia
didn
t
dare
risk
fifteen
of
her
precious
dollars
oh
dear
it
was
difficult
to
be
poor
specially
when
chick
needed
a
frame
where
at
she
planted
a
cautious
kiss
on
the
pictured
countenance
of
charles
dalton
the
palio
race
was
due
to
start
at
five
that
afternoon
cynthia
took
her
sketch
book
and
her
portfolio
to
use
as
a
and
went
off
early
to
find
the
seat
she
had
purchased
three
days
before
she
could
spend
the
time
in
sketching
the
crowd
you
never
could
tell
some
day
she
might
be
called
on
to
illustrate
a
story
about
siena
and
then
her
foresight
and
her
sketches
would
come
in
handy
for
days
the
workmen
of
siena
had
been
preparing
the
piazza
del
campo
for
this
event
in
the
center
was
a
walled
off
space
known
as
the
dog
s
box
where
the
poorer
people
might
stand
the
race
course
itself
came
between
this
and
the
tiers
of
seats
raised
against
the
housefronts
that
faced
the
piazza
hard
narrow
little
seats
like
the
bleachers
of
a
ball
park
but
cynthia
was
lucky
for
she
was
on
the
shady
side
and
was
so
interested
that
she
didn
t
much
care
how
long
she
sat
there
her
neighbors
were
mostly
tourists
french
italians
from
the
south
germans
a
few
austrians
and
one
or
two
americans
small
boys
sold
bags
of
nuts
and
programs
in
five
languages
while
the
shadow
of
the
bell
tower
slowly
crept
across
the
dog
s
box
and
the
hard
packed
earth
of
the
race
course
cynthia
noted
the
mattresses
strapped
against
the
bare
walls
at
the
four
corners
of
the
course
presumably
that
the
horses
or
riders
might
not
be
injured
in
the
scramble
around
these
dangerous
places
and
learned
from
her
pink
leafed
program
that
many
of
the
horses
did
daily
duty
through
siena
s
streets
pulled
cabs
or
fruit
carts
during
the
year
and
their
owners
each
belonged
to
the
from
which
they
were
chosen
to
race
at
last
the
sound
of
a
mortar
the
crowd
which
had
been
strolling
leisurely
about
the
course
began
to
squeeze
in
under
the
fence
to
their
places
in
the
box
or
scramble
up
the
steep
tiers
of
wooden
seats
urged
on
by
the
carabinieri
those
delightful
tweedledum
and
tweedledee
police
of
italy
loiterers
were
soon
cleared
from
the
course
and
way
was
made
for
a
group
of
little
men
like
blue
clad
gnomes
these
pushing
tiny
wheelbarrows
swarmed
along
the
roadway
their
job
seemed
to
be
to
cover
with
earth
any
places
where
the
original
paving
stones
might
show
through
then
again
the
sound
of
the
mortar
and
here
they
come
first
the
ensign
bearer
of
siena
with
the
simple
black
and
white
flag
of
the
city
then
the
palace
trumpets
the
picturesque
long
trumpets
with
their
pendent
banners
carried
by
youthful
pages
in
jaunty
velvet
caps
slashed
doublet
and
sleekly
silken
hose
then
the
musicians
all
in
costume
and
the
crossbowmen
with
their
ancient
weapons
and
at
last
a
group
from
each
in
each
group
a
drummer
two
flag
bearers
a
lord
or
captain
on
horseback
in
gorgeous
armor
of
silver
or
bronze
or
steel
beautifully
inlaid
with
gold
that
glittered
in
the
sunlight
behind
him
his
squires
his
ensign
bearers
and
on
the
race
horse
the
jockey
who
would
ride
later
in
the
race
slowly
the
procession
passed
around
the
course
before
the
judges
stand
and
four
times
as
they
circled
the
square
each
group
paused
that
the
drummers
might
perform
their
little
rhythm
that
the
banner
bearers
might
dance
their
skillful
little
steps
cynthia
sat
enthralled
almost
she
had
to
pinch
herself
to
believe
it
was
real
glorious
in
color
as
an
old
window
of
stained
glass
silks
and
velvets
knights
in
full
armor
pages
banners
and
trumpeters
and
at
the
very
end
the
palio
itself
a
great
banner
drawn
in
a
cart
with
the
staked
flags
of
the
around
it
the
procession
was
over
cynthia
sat
back
and
cracked
a
few
nuts
and
ate
them
just
to
return
to
reality
for
a
while
after
so
much
beauty
was
a
rest
and
a
relief
she
had
thought
so
intensely
packed
it
down
so
tightly
into
her
memory
that
no
least
gesture
of
it
might
be
forgotten
even
so
she
felt
as
though
she
would
have
liked
a
week
of
that
procession
in
order
to
be
able
to
remember
it
all
again
the
mortar
the
race
was
about
to
start
ten
restive
little
horses
ranged
behind
a
rope
ten
jockeys
struggling
to
keep
them
in
line
the
sound
of
the
gun
they
re
off
panting
scrambling
hurled
against
the
dog
s
box
cutting
corners
they
tore
around
the
course
and
the
piazza
was
one
vast
shout
as
though
from
a
single
throat
cynthia
on
her
feet
like
the
rest
stamped
and
clapped
and
shouted
with
the
others
the
snail
the
little
brown
snail
was
among
the
leaders
once
around
the
course
three
times
was
the
extent
of
the
race
and
the
starting
post
was
in
sight
again
but
one
rider
was
off
which
was
it
the
snail
s
cynthia
could
have
sobbed
aloud
with
despair
with
disappointment
her
favorite
out
of
the
race
because
without
a
rider
someone
had
raised
a
whip
and
the
snail
s
jockey
had
been
the
victim
oh
well
so
much
for
that
cynthia
disgusted
almost
sank
back
to
her
seat
but
the
mass
of
excitement
around
her
was
too
strong
to
resist
the
snail
for
some
reason
seemed
still
to
be
a
favorite
his
name
rose
again
and
again
from
surrounding
throats
stubbornly
he
kept
to
the
track
came
to
the
first
of
the
tiny
streets
that
turned
off
away
from
the
race
track
gallantly
he
resisted
temptation
clung
to
the
course
past
the
next
alley
past
the
next
street
and
well
among
the
leaders
still
pulling
ahead
now
faster
and
faster
because
riderless
guideless
the
snail
caught
up
with
the
horse
of
the
eagle
passed
him
caught
up
with
the
horse
of
the
owl
hitherto
the
leader
the
owl
s
rider
plied
whip
with
vigor
but
he
was
a
husky
youth
quite
a
burden
for
the
owl
s
little
horse
to
carry
and
the
snail
was
half
a
head
in
the
lead
as
the
goal
post
was
passed
for
the
second
time
oh
come
on
come
regardless
now
of
the
fact
that
the
horse
was
riderless
cynthia
wanted
only
that
he
should
make
the
circle
the
third
time
successfully
now
he
was
well
in
the
lead
past
the
wicked
flail
of
the
owl
s
malicious
rider
nothing
now
could
stop
him
though
as
he
approached
for
the
third
time
the
steep
street
leading
up
into
the
town
cynthia
held
her
breath
lest
this
time
he
should
leave
the
course
and
gallop
up
it
held
her
breath
so
that
she
was
completely
unconscious
of
the
broad
shoulders
in
front
of
her
which
her
eager
hands
were
grasping
for
an
instant
the
pony
faltered
then
urged
on
by
the
pounding
hoofs
behind
him
passed
the
last
temptation
and
was
on
the
final
stretch
for
the
goal
post
faster
faster
a
length
two
lengths
three
lengths
ahead
cynthia
shouted
wildly
pounded
a
fist
on
the
harris
tweed
shoulder
and
yelled
with
the
others
go
on
snail
go
on
go
on
home
the
race
was
over
and
quite
fitting
that
it
should
have
been
won
by
the
snail
dryly
remarked
the
owner
of
the
harris
tweed
shoulder
cynthia
came
out
of
her
daze
and
gaped
at
him
it
was
the
nice
twinkley
man
she
had
seen
in
the
chapel
this
morning
the
one
who
had
come
to
the
monastery
with
his
wife
oh
i
m
so
sorry
she
gasped
feeling
very
hot
and
red
in
the
face
did
i
pound
you
to
a
jelly
races
are
pretty
exciting
aren
t
they
they
certainly
are
he
agreed
cheerfully
and
that
was
a
most
surprising
do
you
suppose
he
really
won
asked
cynthia
carefully
following
the
man
down
the
steep
narrow
steps
i
don
t
imagine
it
will
be
allowed
like
that
without
a
rider
will
it
the
man
laughed
well
this
is
italy
you
know
and
after
all
they
may
figure
it
was
a
race
for
horses
not
jockeys
and
the
horse
certainly
came
in
ahead
but
let
s
go
and
find
out
he
suggested
by
the
way
my
name
is
lewis
though
i
believe
we
have
met
before
even
if
you
didn
t
know
my
how
do
you
do
lewis
i
m
pleased
to
meet
you
i
m
sure
stated
cynthia
with
mock
primness
and
now
that
s
over
we
re
both
from
the
states
i
gather
and
my
name
is
wanstead
didn
t
your
wife
come
to
the
races
lewis
shook
his
head
if
it
had
been
longchamps
or
saratoga
but
she
wasn
t
interested
in
a
little
italian
hick
town
race
oh
here
we
are
and
i
imagine
there
s
little
doubt
about
the
the
snail
jockey
wreathed
in
flowers
and
comically
suggestive
of
an
ancient
greek
statue
a
blood
stained
handkerchief
as
additional
decoration
about
his
forehead
was
being
carried
high
on
the
shoulders
of
a
dozen
competitors
for
the
honor
of
the
burden
around
him
surged
a
horde
of
shouting
friends
and
at
least
a
score
of
pretty
girls
tossed
jests
and
languorous
glances
toward
the
victor
i
think
they
ought
to
be
carrying
the
horse
up
there
was
cynthia
s
objection
the
jockey
didn
t
do
anything
but
tumble
that
in
itself
seems
to
have
been
a
feat
not
without
its
perils
how
about
some
tea
up
here
to
celebrate
that
our
horse
won
over
the
tea
cups
in
the
ancient
palace
now
transformed
into
a
tea
shop
over
delicious
tiny
cakes
sweet
with
honey
deep
with
frosting
cynthia
heard
about
lewis
heard
that
long
ago
he
too
had
been
an
art
student
and
had
come
to
siena
heard
that
he
had
come
back
this
time
a
successful
broker
to
try
to
recapture
some
of
the
enchantment
of
that
far
off
time
but
it
s
not
the
same
he
said
sadly
how
about
some
more
tea
no
then
some
more
cakes
oh
just
one
well
maybe
just
cynthia
chose
a
cake
like
a
little
italian
palace
all
tiled
with
lemon
peel
and
crowned
with
a
candied
cherry
and
do
you
know
the
lovely
old
monastery
at
the
top
of
the
hill
i
should
say
i
do
i
made
a
sketch
of
that
years
ago
before
you
were
born
young
why
did
people
always
lay
such
emphasis
on
one
s
lack
of
age
but
my
wife
didn
t
think
much
of
it
and
perhaps
it
wasn
t
very
good
really
anyway
it
got
lost
once
when
we
were
his
smile
was
slightly
rueful
and
cynthia
forgave
the
remark
about
her
youthfulness
it
was
of
the
gate
and
a
lovely
old
della
robbia
madonna
i
went
out
to
see
it
again
just
yesterday
but
couldn
t
find
why
i
found
it
and
did
a
sketch
of
it
too
cynthia
blurted
out
and
a
moment
later
wished
she
hadn
t
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
been
dragged
away
before
he
had
had
time
to
do
much
exploring
did
you
oh
could
i
see
it
perhaps
but
first
won
t
you
have
another
cake
some
more
tea
urged
the
hospitable
lewis
i
couldn
t
eat
another
cake
if
i
knew
it
was
the
last
one
in
siena
protested
cynthia
and
i
think
i
ve
got
the
sketch
right
here
the
portfolio
made
a
good
rest
for
my
sketch
so
there
in
the
tea
shop
cool
and
quiet
and
growing
a
bit
dim
as
the
sun
sank
behind
the
towers
and
tiles
of
siena
cynthia
hauled
out
her
sketches
there
were
some
of
the
crowd
she
had
made
just
this
afternoon
of
the
carabinari
heads
gravely
bent
two
by
two
always
two
by
two
white
gloved
hands
folded
behind
their
solemn
backs
you
have
quite
a
knack
for
caricature
commented
lewis
and
cynthia
said
you
have
to
if
you
are
going
to
do
portraits
a
really
good
likeness
always
holds
a
little
at
which
he
nodded
understandingly
nice
to
be
showing
your
sketches
to
another
artist
and
here
are
some
of
the
landscapes
i
ve
done
around
siena
mostly
bits
of
streets
and
old
tiled
houses
they
aren
t
as
good
as
my
and
here
is
your
madonna
she
cried
hauling
out
the
drawing
she
had
finished
the
day
before
she
told
him
about
her
plan
to
have
an
exhibition
of
the
heads
and
of
the
landscapes
together
that
s
a
good
idea
too
he
agreed
and
propped
the
little
sketch
of
the
monastery
against
a
chair
and
sat
back
to
squint
at
it
i
wonder
he
said
at
last
if
you
d
be
willing
to
make
a
sale
before
you
go
home
i
have
a
fancy
to
own
this
one
and
he
nodded
towards
the
little
tiled
gateway
could
you
part
with
it
do
you
think
cynthia
hesitated
she
did
sort
of
want
to
show
that
one
to
chick
and
hear
his
approval
but
perhaps
tomorrow
she
could
go
back
to
the
same
place
and
make
another
even
a
better
one
yes
she
agreed
reluctantly
i
and
then
came
the
how
much
which
she
had
dreaded
cynthia
knew
the
value
at
least
the
commercial
value
of
her
portraits
but
the
landscapes
were
different
they
were
just
studies
perhaps
not
worth
anything
at
all
would
would
two
dollars
be
too
much
she
asked
or
maybe
three
my
dear
child
protested
lewis
and
cynthia
laughed
well
give
me
what
you
like
it
will
be
all
right
oh
american
money
how
nice
to
see
it
again
and
it
was
quite
a
roll
too
she
took
the
two
bills
and
handed
over
the
painting
better
take
along
this
cardboard
it
s
just
the
back
of
the
pad
but
it
fits
and
will
keep
the
sketch
from
being
crumpled
and
now
i
really
must
run
i
promised
a
little
english
girl
at
the
that
i
d
have
dinner
with
her
tonight
and
tell
her
all
about
the
palio
she
couldn
t
afford
a
ticket
for
it
i
know
she
won
t
at
all
approve
of
the
way
it
turned
out
most
unsportin
my
deah
she
laughed
mimicking
the
other
s
accent
goodbye
waved
cynthia
from
the
doorway
nice
lewis
it
had
been
fun
the
tea
and
such
an
appreciative
audience
and
the
two
dollars
she
opened
her
purse
just
for
the
comfort
of
seeing
good
united
states
greenbacks
again
shook
them
out
of
the
rumple
and
gazed
at
them
startled
not
two
one
dollar
bills
but
two
for
ten
dollars
each
twenty
good
bucks
oh
gosh
oh
glory
oh
joy
miss
british
isles
can
wait
said
cynthia
aloud
to
the
deserted
street
and
turned
rapidly
in
a
direction
opposite
to
the
she
knew
somehow
that
her
luck
would
hold
her
marvelous
luck
of
the
day
and
that
even
as
late
as
this
sunset
hour
with
the
rosy
housefronts
of
siena
still
holding
their
perpetual
sunset
glow
the
little
man
in
the
frame
shop
would
still
be
there
chick
that
night
was
no
longer
propped
limply
somewhat
forlornly
between
the
dusty
green
tinged
mirror
and
the
box
of
cold
cream
but
smiled
gaily
resplendently
festively
in
a
frame
of
wine
colored
leather
with
a
border
of
acorns
and
gold
beading
cynthia
bent
over
and
bestowed
a
brief
kiss
on
the
chilly
glass
hi
chick
darling
she
laughed
and
turned
off
the
light
chapter
all
is
not
lost
cynthia
was
sleepy
when
she
stumbled
into
the
station
at
genoa
she
hadn
t
been
too
sure
that
the
hotel
keeper
would
wake
her
in
time
to
get
the
train
for
venice
so
all
night
long
she
had
dozed
fitfully
waking
to
sit
bolt
upright
and
flash
on
the
light
to
see
her
watch
then
finally
been
waked
from
a
sound
sleep
at
five
just
an
hour
before
train
time
by
the
sharp
summoning
knuckles
of
the
garçon
on
her
bedroom
door
and
it
must
have
been
because
her
eyes
were
still
blurred
with
sleep
that
she
took
the
instead
of
the
express
for
venice
they
were
standing
directly
opposite
each
other
and
both
of
them
had
venezia
in
letters
a
foot
high
along
the
carriages
an
italian
does
not
necessarily
move
with
great
rapidity
by
the
best
of
expresses
it
is
a
long
day
s
journey
across
the
width
of
italy
and
by
the
time
she
had
discovered
with
the
half
dozen
native
phrases
that
she
knew
that
she
had
taken
the
wrong
train
it
was
too
late
to
do
anything
about
it
they
were
already
an
hour
east
of
genoa
what
time
do
we
get
to
venezia
she
begged
venezia
si
si
si
si
si
hissed
the
beaming
conductor
as
he
punched
her
ticket
yes
but
what
time
tempo
tempo
she
pleaded
the
conductor
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
probably
mad
this
pretty
signorina
but
he
had
no
english
and
what
did
she
in
third
class
in
that
expensive
dress
of
real
silk
with
leather
shoes
upon
her
feet
a
hat
and
a
suitcase
also
of
veritable
leather
he
gave
it
up
and
sauntered
down
the
crowded
aisle
between
the
wooden
benches
to
examine
the
biglietto
of
a
wizened
little
traveling
with
six
to
milan
cynthia
grinned
and
settled
philosophically
against
the
frame
of
the
open
window
ten
hours
was
a
pretty
long
time
and
it
would
be
more
than
that
now
in
this
poky
old
train
but
anyway
it
was
an
adventure
and
all
part
of
traveling
she
was
certainly
going
in
the
right
direction
there
was
no
one
to
meet
her
at
the
other
end
no
one
to
worry
when
she
didn
t
arrive
and
she
would
have
all
day
to
observe
and
to
make
sketches
third
class
had
been
almost
a
necessity
this
italian
trip
hadn
t
been
allowed
for
in
her
original
budget
but
cynthia
had
found
third
class
in
france
so
much
more
fun
than
second
and
of
course
even
the
italians
say
that
no
one
but
rich
rich
americans
and
officials
who
travel
on
passes
ever
go
by
first
this
was
the
coolest
carriage
too
since
the
always
open
windows
let
in
floods
of
air
and
sunlight
along
with
the
floods
of
dust
and
the
hard
wooden
benches
were
pleasantly
free
of
the
small
insect
life
almost
universally
inhabiting
the
upholstery
of
first
and
second
coaches
but
third
class
in
italy
the
young
man
at
cooks
who
had
sold
her
her
ticket
had
almost
expired
to
hear
of
an
traveling
in
so
unorthodox
a
fashion
no
one
ever
traveled
third
class
in
italy
cynthia
surveyed
the
coach
and
chuckled
again
further
down
the
aisle
two
lovely
little
sisters
of
santa
chiara
in
the
soft
habit
of
their
order
with
spotless
winged
headdresses
and
speckless
collars
munched
contentedly
and
daintily
on
bread
and
cheese
augmented
by
a
bottle
of
water
they
had
brought
with
them
cynthia
s
eye
took
in
the
angle
of
that
tilted
headdress
stealthily
her
fingers
groped
for
and
pencil
a
moment
later
she
was
so
absorbed
in
her
drawing
that
she
grinned
back
in
friendly
fashion
at
the
littlest
sister
who
had
caught
her
drawing
nobody
seemed
to
mind
being
sketched
in
this
country
then
there
was
the
old
great
grandmother
and
her
boisterous
brood
beside
them
she
tended
a
hen
in
her
apron
a
hen
that
seemed
very
content
to
sleep
and
to
cluck
drowsily
in
the
warm
depths
of
that
blue
lap
the
littlest
bambino
was
not
more
than
a
year
old
sleeping
with
bobbing
head
on
the
shoulder
of
the
oldest
sister
he
had
the
most
beautiful
hands
tapering
with
tiny
dimples
and
wee
pink
nails
which
fell
into
enchanting
poses
cynthia
sketched
happily
people
came
and
went
from
every
tiny
station
and
crowds
gathered
and
dispersed
beneath
the
trailing
potted
flowers
that
decorated
the
pillars
of
every
station
platform
cheerily
they
screamed
giorno
arrivederci
italian
someone
had
told
cynthia
was
a
language
intended
to
be
shouted
the
sun
grew
warmer
the
paper
beneath
her
hand
sticky
with
perspiration
somewhere
along
the
line
a
few
lire
purchased
a
sandwich
of
sausage
between
thick
slices
of
warm
bread
a
bottle
of
warmish
water
and
a
bunch
of
sweet
very
juicy
green
grapes
after
lunch
she
curled
in
her
corner
and
slept
when
she
awoke
the
car
was
nearly
empty
and
they
were
clattering
and
banging
through
the
light
of
midafternoon
hills
were
purple
beyond
hot
haze
and
vineyards
white
with
dust
spread
for
miles
and
miles
on
either
side
the
track
cynthia
sighed
and
got
up
to
walk
the
length
of
the
car
and
back
again
where
were
they
now
she
wondered
when
they
stopped
with
a
clatter
and
bang
at
the
next
station
she
hopped
out
to
look
at
the
map
hung
on
the
station
wall
keeping
one
careful
eye
on
the
train
lest
it
slide
out
and
leave
her
she
estimated
the
probable
time
that
it
would
reach
venice
good
gracious
it
was
hours
away
yet
and
at
the
rate
this
train
was
going
the
little
horn
tooted
its
warning
and
cynthia
fled
back
to
her
seat
what
to
do
what
to
do
thank
goodness
nobody
would
be
at
all
worried
or
put
out
by
this
fool
mistake
of
hers
nancy
back
in
brittany
by
now
and
brewster
were
the
only
people
that
knew
about
her
trains
and
her
plans
mother
had
insisted
when
cynthia
first
left
america
that
she
keep
in
touch
close
touch
with
some
one
person
in
europe
and
she
had
been
awfully
faithful
about
that
she
had
even
written
nancy
what
train
she
was
taking
from
genoa
and
now
cynthia
grinned
look
at
the
darn
thing
by
five
o
clock
she
was
ravenous
and
very
weary
from
former
experience
she
knew
that
she
could
hop
off
almost
any
place
that
the
train
might
stop
and
continue
next
day
on
the
same
ticket
but
for
hours
they
had
not
passed
a
decent
sized
town
just
little
settlements
about
the
usual
tiny
church
and
inn
a
few
donkeys
and
a
mangy
yellow
dog
or
two
did
she
dare
get
off
just
anywhere
and
risk
what
she
might
find
or
should
she
stick
on
here
till
seeming
doomsday
till
midnight
anyway
and
arrive
at
some
weird
hour
on
the
unknown
canals
of
venice
fumbling
in
the
pocket
of
her
silk
jacket
she
found
a
single
lira
and
on
impulse
flipped
it
into
the
air
it
dropped
into
her
lap
and
she
covered
it
quickly
with
her
hand
heads
i
ll
get
off
at
the
very
next
stop
no
matter
if
it
s
in
the
middle
of
a
field
tails
i
ll
go
on
to
venice
no
matter
how
late
we
get
there
or
how
hungry
i
am
she
said
aloud
she
uncovered
the
coin
heads
it
was
cynthia
was
a
little
scared
but
determined
oh
very
determined
resolutely
she
took
down
her
suitcase
from
the
rack
swung
her
painting
box
beside
it
firmly
she
waited
by
the
open
window
till
the
train
banged
again
to
a
stop
beside
a
little
shack
that
served
as
a
station
the
sign
read
santa
maria
a
name
which
meant
nothing
to
cynthia
sturdily
she
stepped
backward
down
the
three
steep
steps
to
the
ground
swung
her
box
and
suitcase
off
beside
her
and
turning
her
back
on
the
poky
little
train
walked
toward
the
gate
tomorrow
tomorrow
morning
i
go
to
venice
she
explained
to
the
gatekeeper
who
was
punching
lacework
patterns
into
her
ticket
comprendo
wonderingly
he
let
her
pass
not
until
the
gate
had
closed
firmly
did
cynthia
feel
sure
that
she
herself
wouldn
t
turn
and
race
toward
the
departing
train
the
train
that
eventually
must
reach
venice
when
the
last
shriek
of
the
whistle
had
died
along
the
echoing
hills
when
the
last
smudge
of
smoke
had
disappeared
against
the
dazzling
light
of
the
sinking
sun
cynthia
was
plodding
almost
ankle
deep
in
dust
along
the
wide
path
that
seemed
to
do
duty
as
the
town
road
but
there
was
literally
no
town
here
far
off
across
the
plowed
fields
a
sugar
white
tower
reared
against
the
skyline
the
village
church
four
or
five
scattered
houses
with
the
inevitable
grape
vine
their
whitewashed
sides
stained
verdigris
green
with
arsenic
spray
and
a
tiny
inn
to
which
the
gateman
had
directed
her
this
latter
was
her
objective
its
entrance
was
beneath
a
vine
covered
lattice
and
its
bare
dirt
floor
its
collection
of
dogs
looked
much
like
the
other
farmhouses
but
inside
there
were
several
tables
and
a
girl
behind
a
counter
she
slid
forward
and
smiled
shyly
with
a
flutter
of
incredible
lashes
cynthia
felt
reassured
stumblingly
she
asked
for
a
room
for
the
night
explained
her
wish
to
be
called
early
for
the
first
train
for
venice
yes
signorina
there
was
a
room
but
one
the
signorina
should
regard
it
it
was
bare
save
for
the
bed
table
and
chair
and
directly
above
the
café
but
clean
and
cool
cynthia
nodded
did
not
ask
the
price
and
letting
her
suitcase
slide
to
the
floor
ordered
water
with
which
to
that
was
easy
one
always
asked
for
water
supper
also
should
be
simple
since
a
traveler
was
expected
to
desire
food
cynthia
thought
of
her
first
night
in
paris
and
felt
a
little
proud
of
how
much
more
confident
she
had
become
since
then
what
would
chick
think
of
this
adventure
of
hers
she
wondered
and
was
glad
he
needn
t
know
about
it
for
weeks
yet
he
d
be
sure
to
scold
her
for
taking
such
a
risk
it
proved
however
to
be
no
risk
at
all
at
supper
a
simple
meal
of
spaghetti
a
salad
and
grapes
she
was
examined
shyly
by
several
children
hopefully
by
several
dogs
curiously
by
the
adults
of
the
family
but
the
spaghetti
was
delicious
and
cynthia
was
hungry
after
dinner
she
was
far
too
sleepy
to
do
more
than
take
a
short
walk
down
the
quiet
dusty
road
back
in
her
room
she
wedged
a
chair
under
the
latch
of
the
lockless
door
and
fell
asleep
almost
before
she
could
think
again
what
an
adventure
this
was
the
express
from
the
north
to
which
cynthia
transferred
a
half
hour
beyond
the
little
village
arrived
in
venice
about
nine
o
clock
it
looked
she
thought
as
she
waited
in
the
train
corridor
just
a
little
disappointing
only
a
long
train
shed
no
canals
no
gondolas
no
palaces
in
sight
the
burly
italian
in
front
of
her
swung
off
with
his
bags
cynthia
prepared
to
follow
and
stopped
stock
still
midway
of
the
top
step
came
the
excited
reply
where
on
earth
i
i
thought
you
were
in
new
york
chick
and
stood
gaping
with
open
mouth
until
a
large
bag
prodded
her
not
too
gently
in
the
middle
of
her
back
then
she
swung
down
the
steps
and
dropped
suitcase
and
paint
box
to
fling
herself
into
the
arms
of
the
surprised
young
man
almost
it
seemed
as
surprised
as
she
was
i
thought
you
were
due
last
night
on
the
from
genoa
exclaimed
the
disgusted
chick
you
wrote
that
to
nancy
you
know
and
i
ve
been
meeting
trains
almost
all
night
it
was
only
by
luck
i
stopped
here
i
was
meeting
the
express
from
genoa
on
track
six
ten
minutes
he
signaled
a
porter
this
your
stuff
all
of
it
a
hand
beneath
her
elbow
impersonally
kindly
almost
as
though
he
were
the
favorite
nephew
of
a
maiden
aunt
all
concern
for
her
baggage
that
she
pass
the
the
local
custom
house
that
she
give
her
ticket
to
the
proper
uniformed
official
they
came
out
of
the
stone
doorway
onto
a
half
dozen
steep
stone
steps
before
them
shimmered
the
canal
so
the
popular
report
was
true
and
venice
did
have
them
i
ve
got
a
gondola
waiting
right
here
he
looked
along
the
bobbing
yelling
line
of
gondoliers
who
shouted
their
wares
and
virtues
below
the
quay
dash
that
fellow
she
heard
him
mutter
oh
well
never
mind
cyn
we
ll
take
this
one
and
still
with
that
air
of
a
piloted
her
down
the
step
the
wide
upholstered
seat
was
very
comfortable
with
surprisingly
little
fuss
they
were
in
the
center
of
the
stream
chick
had
given
the
order
his
fingers
caught
hers
and
held
them
tight
good
then
they
really
were
still
engaged
cynthia
chuckled
happily
i
can
t
she
turned
to
gaze
at
him
can
t
get
over
this
chick
it
s
the
greatest
surprise
of
my
that
was
the
intention
chick
grinned
back
he
had
he
told
her
arrived
in
naples
two
days
ago
had
promptly
wired
nancy
to
find
cynthia
s
exact
address
and
had
been
told
of
the
train
she
would
take
to
venice
neat
very
neat
approved
cynthia
if
i
just
hadn
t
taken
a
local
by
mistake
and
now
where
are
you
taking
me
pensione
casa
petrarca
she
nodded
yes
that
was
where
she
had
reserved
a
room
had
your
breakfast
good
then
wash
and
tidy
up
and
we
ll
do
a
bit
of
sightseeing
after
that
quietly
he
slipped
his
hand
from
hers
slid
it
into
his
pocket
oh
dear
chick
what
s
the
matter
what
is
it
i
ve
that
is
i
seem
to
have
and
with
the
maddening
masculine
manner
of
one
blessed
with
many
pockets
started
fumbling
through
them
all
one
after
another
lost
something
chick
frowned
gone
but
i
hope
it
s
not
deliberately
he
went
through
the
whole
lot
again
while
the
gondola
rocked
gently
before
the
steps
of
the
pensione
at
last
he
shrugged
i
came
out
last
night
and
this
morning
with
a
gondolier
named
luigi
from
the
traghetta
that
s
a
sort
of
gondola
across
the
way
if
i
ve
dropped
the
thing
it
ll
probably
be
in
his
gondola
go
on
up
will
you
i
ll
see
if
i
can
trace
a
big
airy
room
with
a
quaint
porcelain
stove
in
the
corner
as
the
door
closed
behind
the
porter
cynthia
dropped
into
a
chair
and
dragged
off
her
hat
she
didn
t
know
whether
to
weep
or
to
laugh
was
she
or
was
she
not
engaged
to
chick
he
hadn
t
mentioned
it
he
hadn
t
acted
like
it
she
decided
to
laugh
and
felt
better
washed
her
face
ran
a
comb
through
her
curls
and
felt
better
yet
a
bit
of
powder
some
rouge
and
she
was
ready
to
meet
the
world
again
or
at
least
venice
and
chick
he
was
waiting
for
her
by
the
pensione
steps
know
any
italian
he
asked
anxiously
not
much
i
m
afraid
but
she
thought
probably
more
than
he
did
well
come
see
if
you
can
make
anything
out
of
this
jumble
of
talk
i
m
about
cuckoo
we
ll
walk
across
it
s
a
good
chance
to
see
the
rialto
this
was
of
stone
lined
with
a
shallow
stepped
series
of
shops
on
either
side
going
up
going
down
till
one
reached
the
farther
side
of
the
grand
canal
here
chick
pointed
out
the
row
of
gondolas
as
the
from
which
he
had
taken
luigi
cynthia
stammered
a
few
questions
listened
to
the
voluble
replies
and
managed
to
make
out
that
luigi
had
gone
some
where
with
a
sightseeing
party
probably
to
one
of
the
islands
he
d
be
back
later
in
the
day
this
morning
asked
chick
anxiously
i
guess
cynthia
was
slightly
careless
about
that
funny
of
chick
not
like
him
to
make
such
a
fuss
over
some
silly
little
souvenir
he
d
bought
come
on
she
put
a
hand
on
his
arm
let
s
go
for
a
somewhat
reluctantly
chick
agreed
over
tiny
crooked
stone
bridges
they
went
along
quays
along
whose
mossy
sides
the
water
lapped
dark
and
mysterious
down
blind
colorful
alleys
where
small
children
stuck
their
heads
from
windows
and
yelled
shrilly
no
passage
cynthia
adored
it
all
adored
being
with
chick
again
if
he
only
wouldn
t
fuss
so
she
thought
for
he
kept
looking
at
his
watch
glancing
back
over
his
shoulder
until
finally
she
gave
it
up
in
despair
no
use
of
sightseeing
till
chick
recovered
his
lost
property
how
about
going
back
now
and
having
another
try
at
your
gondolier
she
suggested
he
was
so
grateful
that
she
was
almost
ashamed
of
her
impatience
and
they
turned
back
immediately
but
there
was
no
further
news
luigi
had
not
returned
desperately
chick
started
to
ask
questions
perhaps
one
of
the
other
gondoliers
had
heard
luigi
speak
of
a
package
he
had
found
cynthia
first
on
one
foot
and
then
on
the
other
for
she
was
getting
a
little
tired
translated
to
the
best
of
her
ability
chick
stuck
in
a
word
now
and
then
lost
was
chick
s
gender
wrong
or
had
he
really
mislaid
a
blonde
but
a
few
in
the
group
of
gondoliers
got
the
idea
apparently
each
one
had
at
one
time
or
another
discovered
something
from
beneath
the
blanket
of
a
gondola
was
produced
a
magazine
cynthia
beginning
to
be
amused
read
the
lurid
title
in
flaming
vermilion
sprawled
across
its
cover
true
tales
of
the
wild
the
date
was
over
a
year
ago
but
it
had
been
undoubtedly
once
lost
other
gondoliers
left
their
bobbing
craft
drew
closer
as
chick
s
eagerness
held
promise
of
rich
reward
waving
the
magazine
aside
he
chanted
impatiently
piccolo
piccolo
while
he
made
gestures
of
small
measurement
with
his
hands
then
aside
to
cynthia
that
does
mean
little
doesn
t
it
not
a
musical
instrument
cynthia
nodded
silently
not
daring
to
risk
speech
and
watched
with
dancing
eyes
while
chick
refused
from
a
second
cheerful
brigand
a
musty
torn
golash
cheerful
brigand
number
two
was
a
sheer
loss
to
high
pressure
salesmanship
cynthia
caught
the
word
waterproof
as
he
covered
the
tear
with
one
big
hand
twisting
the
rubber
inside
out
he
sought
to
display
its
amazing
suppleness
and
elasticity
while
an
admiring
group
applauded
both
at
the
golash
and
the
salesman
with
ohs
and
ahs
of
astonishment
cynthia
was
wondering
how
a
single
torn
rubber
had
been
brought
from
so
many
thousand
miles
to
lie
forgotten
in
a
venetian
gondola
and
also
how
the
gondolier
thought
chick
with
a
foot
obviously
many
sizes
larger
was
going
to
use
it
but
perhaps
he
surmised
a
sentimental
attachment
she
glanced
at
chick
poor
darling
this
was
awfully
important
to
him
and
it
was
mean
of
her
to
take
it
all
so
lightly
but
he
was
being
pretty
darn
solemn
and
masculine
impatiently
she
said
if
you
d
tell
me
what
it
is
chick
perhaps
i
could
make
them
oh
dear
how
annoying
men
could
be
chick
seemed
not
to
hear
the
new
distraction
was
a
cabbage
wilted
but
unquestionably
of
more
recent
vintage
than
either
the
galosh
or
the
ancient
magazine
its
discoverer
had
waited
for
a
time
outside
the
magic
circle
while
firing
forth
a
rapid
stream
of
ecco
ecco
as
he
held
aloft
the
proffered
vegetable
breaking
through
at
last
he
encountered
the
two
previous
presenters
of
articles
thus
gaining
the
attention
also
of
the
crowd
which
was
his
downfall
an
old
woman
black
shawl
over
her
head
flattened
slippers
of
magenta
felt
upon
her
feet
having
heaved
her
way
through
by
sheer
force
of
language
not
only
wanted
a
cabbage
but
cabbage
perhaps
it
was
the
cabbage
of
her
childhood
perhaps
she
had
nursed
it
from
a
tiny
seedling
this
dejected
thing
for
a
moment
longer
cynthia
listened
then
screwed
up
her
face
and
clapped
frantic
hands
to
ears
couldn
t
they
get
out
of
this
soon
close
behind
the
old
woman
came
shouldering
two
calm
carabinieri
just
in
time
it
seemed
to
prevent
a
general
combat
white
gloved
hands
behind
them
patent
leather
hats
set
squarely
above
unruffled
brows
two
identical
magnificent
examples
of
the
venetian
police
tweedledum
it
seemed
asked
the
questions
tweedledee
answered
them
conversely
dum
asked
and
dee
answered
comparative
silence
settled
upon
the
circle
and
cynthia
cautiously
removed
her
hands
from
her
ears
all
available
witnesses
began
to
present
their
evidence
as
there
were
perhaps
a
score
in
number
all
acting
out
their
theories
in
violent
pantomime
cynthia
began
to
wish
they
weren
t
right
in
the
center
of
it
the
one
who
had
taken
upon
himself
the
part
of
the
inquirer
after
lost
articles
chick
s
rôle
in
fact
was
losing
things
in
all
directions
with
wide
dramatic
sweeps
of
his
arms
tweedledum
and
tweedledee
executed
a
half
turn
in
perfect
unison
raised
right
hands
in
gloves
of
immaculate
whiteness
in
formal
salutation
and
in
chick
s
direction
by
now
cynthia
knew
them
of
old
they
would
have
come
to
an
unshakable
conclusion
if
they
awarded
the
galosh
to
the
old
lady
the
cabbage
to
chick
both
parties
would
have
to
be
content
but
no
they
had
another
plan
the
cabbage
was
bestowed
upon
its
rightful
owner
who
still
lingered
voluminous
with
words
to
see
what
else
might
happen
the
golash
returned
to
the
gondolier
in
whose
craft
it
had
originally
been
found
cynthia
applauded
the
decision
then
translated
for
chick
s
benefit
tweedledum
s
speech
we
re
to
go
to
the
police
station
chick
that
ll
teach
you
young
man
not
to
start
riots
and
i
hope
it
does
behind
them
an
admiring
and
still
unsilenced
throng
applauded
their
departure
even
followed
a
short
distance
along
the
quay
and
over
the
ancient
bridge
my
heavens
fumed
chick
can
t
they
understand
i
ve
said
perdita
and
piccolo
till
i
m
black
in
the
but
cynthia
was
enjoying
herself
if
you
d
tell
them
a
little
more
she
soothed
slipping
her
hand
into
his
arm
or
if
you
d
even
tell
me
what
in
the
name
of
agatha
you
lost
anyway
the
police
were
speaking
again
cynthia
thought
she
caught
the
word
did
that
mean
found
the
lost
and
found
department
perhaps
she
made
that
suggestion
to
chick
a
few
more
streets
a
bridge
or
two
a
narrow
way
and
one
of
the
innumerable
palaces
which
seemed
now
to
be
a
police
station
with
the
crown
and
arms
of
italy
above
the
door
beyond
this
a
damp
and
cheerless
room
none
too
clean
and
the
equivalent
of
a
desk
sergeant
who
drew
towards
him
a
large
book
and
set
down
their
names
chick
s
and
cynthia
s
and
their
dum
and
dee
were
doing
all
the
explaining
but
in
italian
far
too
rapid
for
cynthia
to
follow
it
might
yet
prove
that
she
and
chick
had
defied
municipal
authority
by
starting
a
barter
shop
on
the
quayside
one
decaying
golash
for
a
wilted
cabbage
tweedledum
and
tweedledee
had
finished
the
man
at
the
desk
made
a
gesture
an
attendant
opened
a
door
flung
back
a
huge
iron
grill
that
closed
off
about
half
the
room
behind
it
and
signed
for
them
to
enter
cynthia
clutched
at
chick
s
arm
oh
dear
frankly
uncertain
she
followed
chick
s
slow
steps
the
attendant
close
behind
dum
and
dee
bringing
up
in
the
rear
then
the
attendant
switched
on
a
light
a
series
of
lights
disclosing
what
might
have
been
a
wine
cellar
but
instead
of
wine
cynthia
choked
back
her
laughter
and
pointed
a
bicycle
a
shelf
of
gloves
a
regular
store
of
ancient
umbrellas
and
sunshades
piles
and
piles
of
books
mostly
baedeckers
by
their
moldy
red
bindings
boots
odd
bits
of
clothing
a
coffeepot
market
loads
still
knotted
in
capacious
handkerchiefs
a
coffin
a
load
of
bricks
chick
s
face
was
flaming
how
in
the
name
of
goodness
can
we
tell
whether
it
s
here
or
not
he
turned
to
cynthia
don
t
they
have
a
list
of
things
somewhere
and
the
times
they
were
found
tell
them
it
s
small
small
and
done
up
in
white
paper
and
a
i
know
cynthia
nodded
solemnly
a
pound
of
butter
chick
dear
oh
chick
you
weren
t
going
to
ask
me
to
set
up
housekeeping
were
you
but
at
the
hurt
expression
in
his
eyes
her
levity
dimmed
i
ll
tell
them
you
lost
it
last
night
is
that
it
and
turning
to
dum
and
dee
carefully
choosing
her
words
she
managed
to
convey
the
idea
one
of
them
gave
a
shrug
of
disappointment
which
was
echoed
by
the
other
with
all
these
things
to
choose
from
they
seemed
to
say
surely
any
but
the
most
captious
would
be
satisfied
but
they
turned
to
discuss
the
matter
with
the
attendant
lights
began
to
go
out
indication
that
this
particular
exhibition
was
over
finish
but
apparently
more
was
to
follow
chick
might
yet
discover
his
pound
of
butter
as
they
returned
to
the
main
room
the
attendant
departed
and
polite
gestures
demanded
that
chick
and
cynthia
should
take
chairs
and
wait
an
air
of
expectancy
hung
above
the
little
room
obviously
the
choicest
gem
of
the
collection
something
too
valuable
to
be
left
with
the
other
articles
had
been
sent
for
do
you
think
they
ve
sent
to
the
bank
asked
cynthia
chick
brightened
at
the
suggestion
brightened
until
the
door
swung
open
again
there
entered
behind
the
attendant
a
woman
slatternly
down
at
heels
very
cross
and
carrying
a
basket
on
her
arm
slowly
reluctantly
she
advanced
to
the
desk
lifted
the
cover
of
the
basket
at
the
summons
of
the
sergeant
chick
appeared
beside
her
with
a
wild
burst
dum
and
dee
grabbed
the
basket
from
the
woman
thrust
it
into
chick
s
reluctant
arms
whereat
the
basket
considerably
disturbed
let
out
a
long
neck
green
mottled
with
brown
feathers
a
wide
open
yellow
beak
an
indignant
eye
and
a
stiffly
upstanding
comb
of
violent
red
loudly
the
occupant
of
the
basket
protested
with
a
violent
c
ck
a
doo
dle
do
chick
nearly
dropped
the
basket
cynthia
nearly
helpless
with
laughter
had
fallen
into
a
chair
and
with
face
buried
in
her
handkerchief
could
only
indulge
in
what
dum
and
dee
must
surely
have
considered
tears
of
uncontrolled
joy
at
this
return
of
her
lost
property
sympathetic
murmurs
croonings
of
consolation
echoed
about
the
room
even
the
rather
hard
faced
woman
was
touched
chick
stood
stupidly
staring
the
hardest
part
of
the
day
came
when
cynthia
drying
her
streaming
eyes
was
forced
into
sufficient
sobriety
and
italian
to
explain
that
indeed
and
indeed
the
rooster
and
it
was
a
beautiful
rooster
oh
a
magnificent
rooster
was
not
theirs
was
not
at
all
what
they
sought
no
no
no
no
no
like
a
popgun
cynthia
shot
out
violent
negatives
and
at
last
she
had
made
it
clear
almost
with
joy
the
woman
received
back
the
cherished
rooster
from
chick
s
relieved
embrace
almost
haughtily
they
were
shown
to
the
door
sent
with
an
air
of
extreme
disapproval
upon
their
way
outside
in
the
sunlight
cynthia
was
almost
surprised
to
find
it
was
the
same
day
and
chick
pulled
down
his
coat
let
out
a
great
puff
of
a
sigh
after
that
first
burst
of
laughter
cynthia
had
managed
to
get
control
of
herself
but
she
wasn
t
sure
how
long
this
would
last
she
must
get
somewhere
anywhere
and
have
it
all
out
with
chick
meekly
she
took
his
arm
let
him
lead
her
along
the
quay
through
small
streets
toward
the
piazza
san
marco
she
glanced
upward
chick
was
being
very
masculine
very
stern
one
might
almost
think
unforgiving
in
silence
they
traversed
the
small
streets
well
if
chick
was
going
to
be
stuffy
but
he
couldn
t
be
he
simply
couldn
t
be
and
whose
beastly
old
bundle
was
it
anyway
didn
t
go
about
leaving
things
in
gondolas
florio
s
on
the
piazza
san
marco
a
small
green
iron
table
two
small
twisted
iron
chairs
and
an
attentive
waiter
in
a
white
apron
chick
s
eyes
consulted
cynthia
then
ordered
two
lemonades
they
came
in
silence
cynthia
sipped
hers
bit
her
lips
gulped
and
regarded
fixedly
a
stupid
pink
toed
pigeon
who
was
strutting
with
puffed
out
chest
before
the
lovely
little
faun
colored
lady
of
his
choice
sideways
out
of
her
eyes
cynthia
caught
a
glimpse
of
chick
then
turned
to
face
him
his
face
was
red
but
in
his
eyes
was
now
a
glimmer
of
understanding
one
might
almost
say
mirth
cynthia
dared
a
slight
tremulous
giggle
forerunner
of
the
gale
to
come
then
oh
chick
chick
if
you
could
have
seen
yourself
with
that
silly
rooster
and
the
cabbage
and
tweedledum
the
tide
had
risen
now
all
bars
were
down
rocking
with
mirth
they
clung
to
the
little
iron
chairs
and
laughed
and
laughed
a
moment
s
pause
to
recount
the
pomposity
of
the
attendant
the
old
woman
with
the
cabbage
the
galosh
the
list
of
things
in
that
storeroom
did
you
see
the
bicycle
who
could
have
left
those
high
buttoned
shoes
oh
and
the
fans
simply
stacks
of
them
for
ten
minutes
the
gale
raged
backwards
and
forwards
then
weak
and
helpless
cynthia
begged
for
another
lemonade
wiped
the
tears
from
her
eyes
and
subsided
into
comparative
sanity
their
laughter
together
had
relieved
her
in
many
ways
it
was
going
to
be
all
right
now
she
and
chick
still
thought
alike
could
still
find
amusement
in
the
same
things
and
the
doubts
of
the
morning
were
all
swept
away
but
chick
doggedly
she
returned
to
the
old
question
now
it
s
all
over
you
can
tell
me
can
t
you
what
was
in
that
package
chick
wasn
t
going
to
be
stuffy
about
it
any
more
he
grinned
this
time
but
shook
his
head
if
we
don
t
find
it
today
i
ll
really
tell
you
not
yet
cross
your
heart
cross
my
heart
from
the
corner
of
the
square
a
big
bell
began
a
slow
solemn
booming
and
as
though
it
was
a
signal
hundreds
thousands
of
pigeons
rose
against
the
deep
blue
of
the
venetian
sky
and
the
sunlit
columns
opposite
glinting
silvery
iridescent
dark
blue
and
rose
and
gold
they
whirled
with
the
muffled
beat
and
roar
of
a
thousand
wings
cynthia
gazed
enthralled
across
the
square
giving
access
to
the
merceria
the
way
of
the
merchants
was
the
clock
tower
as
the
great
painted
face
recorded
noon
two
giant
moors
slowly
struck
a
bronze
bell
with
big
hammers
marking
the
hour
lovely
murmured
cynthia
oh
chick
i
wish
i
wish
we
didn
t
have
to
go
back
ever
i
wish
we
could
stay
on
in
one
of
those
sweet
old
palaces
like
othello
and
desdemona
no
slowly
she
got
smothered
didn
t
she
i
guess
i
wouldn
t
care
for
new
york
will
be
fun
too
hazarded
chick
and
with
all
the
advertisement
you
ve
had
young
lady
your
magazine
covers
on
every
newstand
month
after
chick
are
they
really
yes
i
suppose
they
are
i
hadn
t
thought
of
that
better
hurry
back
hadn
t
i
and
then
laughed
at
her
own
mood
well
what
shall
we
do
next
chick
i
feel
sane
once
chick
s
suggestion
was
lunch
at
the
danieli
which
was
the
swankiest
hotel
in
venice
and
he
had
heard
one
of
the
loveliest
of
the
old
venetian
palaces
then
back
to
the
traghetti
to
see
if
luigi
had
come
oh
that
again
cynthia
made
an
impatient
gesture
save
us
from
a
man
with
one
idea
but
she
adored
the
lunch
loved
the
gracious
old
palace
with
its
carved
minstrel
gallery
its
floor
of
multicolored
tiles
its
ceiling
carved
and
painted
in
deep
blue
and
rose
and
gold
out
into
the
sunlight
again
and
the
adriatic
shimmering
as
blue
as
the
ceiling
a
pleasant
little
wind
chilled
by
the
snows
of
the
dalmatian
alps
and
the
white
bubble
of
the
church
of
the
salute
rising
across
the
lagoon
shall
we
ride
or
walk
asked
chick
by
the
way
he
said
it
cynthia
knew
he
wanted
to
walk
we
see
more
on
foot
don
t
we
she
suggested
amiably
perhaps
a
little
later
they
could
go
through
the
grand
canal
in
a
gondola
and
indeed
she
loved
the
great
piazza
flanked
by
the
doges
palace
by
mark
s
and
the
long
colonnade
of
the
library
and
the
mint
and
the
shops
beneath
those
columns
most
fascinating
of
all
cynthia
s
whole
allowance
for
abroad
had
been
divided
between
seeing
places
and
saving
up
a
bit
for
what
might
when
she
got
home
prove
to
be
a
long
wait
for
more
work
but
she
had
learned
a
lot
by
looking
just
in
windows
had
learned
that
you
can
so
memorize
a
beautiful
thing
you
can
at
least
carry
it
away
with
you
in
your
mind
see
chick
isn
t
that
the
loveliest
old
bracelet
a
thick
circle
not
quite
joined
of
gold
the
two
ends
which
almost
touched
circled
with
tiny
crowns
of
blue
blue
turquoises
and
oh
chick
just
look
at
that
ring
a
lovely
old
thing
of
florentine
gold
studded
with
seed
pearls
and
surrounding
a
topaz
as
richly
dark
as
the
gold
itself
chick
put
a
hand
on
her
arm
and
urged
her
along
to
the
next
window
which
being
full
of
ancient
books
and
maps
was
not
quite
so
enthralling
perhaps
it
hadn
t
been
really
tactful
to
admire
that
ring
almost
as
though
she
had
wanted
it
herself
she
had
chick
s
own
ring
hadn
t
she
the
little
emerald
very
prettily
set
not
quite
good
enough
not
quite
old
enough
to
be
called
an
antique
not
quite
the
same
as
though
it
had
been
bought
just
for
her
cynthia
checked
the
feeling
it
was
unkind
ungracious
ungrateful
chick
was
just
a
poster
artist
in
the
first
year
of
his
success
he
had
come
all
the
way
to
venice
just
to
see
her
or
at
least
she
supposed
he
had
for
he
hadn
t
said
so
yet
and
thank
goodness
here
was
the
traghetti
perhaps
they
d
find
that
stupid
lost
bundle
of
chick
s
at
last
word
must
have
been
passed
around
for
there
was
someone
chick
exclaimed
that
it
was
luigi
waiting
for
them
his
weathered
old
face
a
mass
of
interweaving
laughter
wrinkles
sturdy
stocky
clad
in
ragged
clean
shirt
with
the
uniform
black
trousers
and
sash
of
the
public
gondolier
luigi
dashed
up
the
short
flight
of
steps
rushed
toward
them
in
his
outstretched
hand
he
held
a
parcel
small
oh
very
small
not
big
enough
even
for
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
butter
it
had
been
opened
clumsily
retied
with
gray
twine
thrusting
it
into
chick
s
hand
he
followed
with
a
flood
of
rapid
italian
once
more
a
circle
of
interested
onlookers
threatened
to
engulf
them
chick
gave
a
hasty
order
grasped
cynthia
s
arm
and
thrust
her
down
the
steps
into
the
luigi
gondola
then
waved
a
wide
gesture
down
the
grand
canal
toward
the
lagoon
beyond
buono
buono
agreed
luigi
nodding
vigorously
like
a
porcelain
mandarin
there
came
a
faint
cheer
from
the
crowd
on
the
quay
and
cynthia
recognized
a
few
of
their
morning
s
spectators
but
the
man
with
the
galosh
the
woman
with
the
cabbage
were
not
present
from
the
comfortable
cushioned
seat
she
watched
palaces
of
kings
and
doges
princesses
great
composers
and
poets
glide
past
this
was
heavenly
this
was
the
way
to
see
venice
to
see
any
place
with
chick
s
hand
in
hers
and
not
a
care
in
the
world
then
she
saw
the
little
package
in
his
other
hand
glanced
up
inquiringly
and
caught
the
look
in
his
eyes
her
heart
skipped
a
beat
two
beats
no
nephew
ever
looked
like
that
at
a
maiden
aunt
let
s
said
chick
taking
his
hand
out
of
hers
let
s
both
undo
the
package
you
do
want
to
see
what
s
in
it
don
t
you
cyn
cynthia
laughed
here
i
ve
been
hustled
and
bustled
over
half
of
venice
in
jail
and
out
again
she
addressed
the
diminishing
houses
of
candy
pink
baby
blue
as
the
gondola
struck
the
wide
lagoon
and
rocked
slowly
away
from
the
town
and
he
asks
me
do
i
want
to
know
what
s
in
it
man
alive
do
you
think
i
ve
got
no
curiosity
from
behind
them
came
a
musical
shout
luigi
warning
off
another
gondola
beyond
him
venice
glowed
pearl
pink
in
the
late
light
of
afternoon
the
long
paddle
made
a
soft
ripple
on
the
blue
lagoon
dark
italian
eyes
looked
over
their
shoulders
whole
heartedly
honestly
as
curious
as
cynthia
and
two
heads
one
brown
one
blond
bent
close
together
cynthia
untied
the
knot
with
slim
fingers
that
were
cold
and
loosened
the
rumpled
white
paper
a
small
box
of
blue
stained
leather
beautifully
tooled
in
gilt
she
lifted
the
lid
oh
chick
oh
you
darling
chick
is
it
really
really
for
me
on
the
third
finger
of
her
right
hand
she
slipped
it
quaint
old
green
gold
delicately
lacy
as
the
collar
of
a
doge
held
firmly
in
its
heart
a
single
pink
pearl
chick
reached
and
took
the
hand
in
his
slipped
off
the
ring
slid
into
his
palm
the
little
emerald
she
had
worn
all
summer
and
in
its
place
substituted
the
other
it
fitted
as
though
it
had
been
made
for
her
perhaps
it
was
just
for
you
yourself
he
said
it
s
quite
old
four
or
five
hundred
years
they
told
me
i
got
it
yesterday
afternoon
in
one
of
those
shops
you
looked
at
cynthia
and
i
ve
been
frantic
all
day
i
wanted
to
tell
you
just
this
way
in
a
gondola
with
just
this
ring
and
i
couldn
t
darling
tell
you
chick
it
s
the
most
beautiful
beautiful
thing
i
ever
saw
in
my
whole
isn
t
it
said
chick
but
when
she
glanced
up
his
eyes
were
not
on
the
ring
tomorrow
he
said
we
ll
see
the
american
consul
i
understand
he
s
the
marrying

about
behind
them
suddenly
came
a
great
shout

confidentially
luigi
leaned
forward
whispered
in
tones
that
