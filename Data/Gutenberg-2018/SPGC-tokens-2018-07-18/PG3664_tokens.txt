chapter
i
the
initiation
of
saval
as
they
were
leaving
the
cafe
riche
jean
de
servigny
said
to
leon
saval
if
you
do
object
let
us
walk
the
weather
is
too
fine
to
take
a
cab
his
friend
answered
i
would
like
nothing
better
jean
replied
it
is
hardly
eleven
we
shall
arrive
much
before
midnight
so
let
us
go
slowly
a
restless
crowd
was
moving
along
the
boulevard
that
throng
peculiar
to
summer
nights
drinking
chatting
and
flowing
like
a
river
filled
with
a
sense
of
comfort
and
joy
here
and
there
a
cafe
threw
a
flood
of
light
upon
a
knot
of
patrons
drinking
at
little
tables
on
the
sidewalk
which
were
covered
with
bottles
and
glasses
hindering
the
passing
of
the
hurrying
multitude
on
the
pavement
the
cabs
with
their
red
blue
or
green
lights
dashed
by
showing
for
a
second
in
the
glimmer
the
thin
shadow
of
the
horse
the
raised
profile
of
the
coachman
and
the
dark
box
of
the
carriage
the
cabs
of
the
urbaine
company
made
clear
and
rapid
spots
when
their
yellow
panels
were
struck
by
the
light
the
two
friends
walked
with
slow
steps
cigars
in
their
mouths
in
evening
dress
and
overcoats
on
their
arms
with
a
flower
in
their
buttonholes
and
their
hats
a
trifle
on
one
side
as
men
will
carelessly
wear
them
sometimes
after
they
have
dined
well
and
the
air
is
mild
they
had
been
linked
together
since
their
college
days
by
a
close
devoted
and
firm
affection
jean
de
servigny
small
slender
a
trifle
bald
rather
frail
with
elegance
of
mien
curled
mustache
bright
eyes
and
fine
lips
was
a
man
who
seemed
born
and
bred
upon
the
boulevard
he
was
tireless
in
spite
of
his
languid
air
strong
in
spite
of
his
pallor
one
of
those
slight
parisians
to
whom
gymnastic
exercise
fencing
cold
shower
and
hot
baths
give
a
nervous
artificial
strength
he
was
known
by
his
marriage
as
well
as
by
his
wit
his
fortune
his
connections
and
by
that
sociability
amiability
and
fashionable
gallantry
peculiar
to
certain
men
a
true
parisian
furthermore
light
sceptical
changeable
captivating
energetic
and
irresolute
capable
of
everything
and
of
nothing
selfish
by
principle
and
generous
on
occasion
he
lived
moderately
upon
his
income
and
amused
himself
with
hygiene
indifferent
and
passionate
he
gave
himself
rein
and
drew
back
constantly
impelled
by
conflicting
instincts
yielding
to
all
and
then
obeying
in
the
end
his
own
shrewd
judgment
whose
logic
consisted
in
following
the
wind
and
drawing
profit
from
circumstances
without
taking
the
trouble
to
originate
them
his
companion
leon
saval
rich
also
was
one
of
those
superb
and
colossal
figures
who
make
women
turn
around
in
the
streets
to
look
at
them
he
gave
the
idea
of
a
statue
turned
into
a
man
a
type
of
a
race
like
those
sculptured
forms
which
are
sent
to
the
salons
too
handsome
too
tall
too
big
too
strong
he
sinned
a
little
from
the
excess
of
everything
the
excess
of
his
qualities
he
had
on
hand
countless
affairs
of
passion
as
they
reached
the
vaudeville
theater
he
asked
have
you
warned
that
lady
that
you
are
going
to
take
me
to
her
house
to
see
her
servigny
began
to
laugh
forewarn
the
marquise
obardi
do
you
warn
an
omnibus
driver
that
you
shall
enter
his
stage
at
the
corner
of
the
boulevard
saval
a
little
perplexed
inquired
what
sort
of
person
is
this
lady
his
friend
replied
an
upstart
a
charming
hussy
who
came
from
no
one
knows
where
who
made
her
appearance
one
day
nobody
knows
how
among
the
adventuresses
of
paris
knowing
perfectly
well
how
to
take
care
of
herself
besides
what
difference
does
it
make
to
us
they
say
that
her
real
name
her
maiden
name
for
she
still
has
every
claim
to
the
title
of
maiden
except
that
of
innocence
is
octavia
bardin
from
which
she
constructs
the
name
obardi
by
prefixing
the
first
letter
of
her
first
name
and
dropping
the
last
letter
of
the
last
name
moreover
she
is
a
lovable
woman
and
you
from
your
physique
are
inevitably
bound
to
become
her
lover
hercules
is
not
introduced
into
messalina
home
without
making
some
disturbance
nevertheless
i
make
bold
to
add
that
if
there
is
free
entrance
to
this
house
just
as
there
is
in
bazaars
you
are
not
exactly
compelled
to
buy
what
is
for
sale
love
and
cards
are
on
the
programme
but
nobody
compels
you
to
take
up
with
either
and
the
exit
is
as
free
as
the
entrance
she
settled
down
in
the
etoile
district
a
suspicious
neighborhood
three
years
ago
and
opened
her
to
that
froth
of
the
continents
which
comes
to
paris
to
practice
its
various
formidable
and
criminal
talents
i
do
remember
just
how
i
went
to
her
house
i
went
as
we
all
go
because
there
is
card
playing
because
the
women
are
compliant
and
the
men
dishonest
i
love
that
social
mob
of
buccaneers
with
decorations
of
all
sorts
of
orders
all
titled
and
all
entirely
unknown
at
their
embassies
except
to
the
spies
they
are
always
dragging
in
the
subject
of
honor
quoting
the
list
of
their
ancestors
on
the
slightest
provocation
and
telling
the
story
of
their
life
at
every
opportunity
braggarts
liars
sharpers
dangerous
as
their
cards
false
as
their
names
brave
because
they
have
to
be
like
the
assassins
who
can
not
pluck
their
victims
except
by
exposing
their
own
lives
in
a
word
it
is
the
aristocracy
of
the
bagnio
i
like
them
they
are
interesting
to
fathom
and
to
know
amusing
to
listen
to
often
witty
never
commonplace
as
the
ordinary
french
guests
their
women
are
always
pretty
with
a
little
flavor
of
foreign
knavery
with
the
mystery
of
their
past
existence
half
of
which
perhaps
spent
in
a
house
of
correction
they
generally
have
fine
eyes
and
glorious
hair
the
true
physique
of
the
profession
an
intoxicating
grace
a
seductiveness
which
drives
men
to
folly
an
unwholesome
irresistible
charm
they
conquer
like
the
highwaymen
of
old
they
are
rapacious
creatures
true
birds
of
prey
i
like
them
too
the
marquise
obardi
is
one
of
the
type
of
these
elegant
ripe
and
pretty
with
a
feline
charm
you
can
see
that
she
is
vicious
to
the
marrow
everybody
has
a
good
time
at
her
house
with
cards
dancing
and
suppers
in
fact
there
is
everything
which
goes
to
make
up
the
pleasures
of
fashionable
society
life
have
you
ever
been
or
are
you
now
her
lover
leon
saval
asked
i
have
not
been
her
lover
i
am
not
now
and
i
never
shall
be
i
only
go
to
the
house
to
see
her
daughter
ah
she
has
a
daughter
then
a
daughter
a
marvel
my
dear
man
she
is
the
principal
attraction
of
the
den
tall
magnificent
just
ripe
eighteen
years
old
as
fair
as
her
mother
is
dark
always
merry
always
ready
for
an
entertainment
always
laughing
and
ready
to
dance
like
mad
who
will
be
the
lucky
man
to
capture
her
or
who
has
already
done
so
nobody
can
tell
that
she
has
ten
of
us
in
her
train
all
hoping
such
a
daughter
in
the
hands
of
a
woman
like
the
marquise
is
a
fortune
and
they
play
the
game
together
the
two
charmers
no
one
knows
just
what
they
are
planning
perhaps
they
are
waiting
for
a
better
bargain
than
i
should
prove
but
i
tell
you
that
i
shall
close
the
bargain
if
i
ever
get
a
chance
that
girl
yvette
absolutely
baffles
me
moreover
she
is
a
mystery
if
she
is
not
the
most
complete
monster
of
astuteness
and
perversity
that
i
have
ever
seen
she
certainly
is
the
most
marvelous
phenomenon
of
innocence
that
can
be
imagined
she
lives
in
that
atmosphere
of
infamy
with
a
calm
and
triumphing
ease
which
is
either
wonderfully
profligate
or
entirely
artless
strange
scion
of
an
adventuress
cast
upon
the
of
that
set
like
a
magnificent
plant
nurtured
upon
corruption
or
rather
like
the
daughter
of
some
noble
race
of
some
great
artist
or
of
some
grand
lord
of
some
prince
or
dethroned
king
tossed
some
evening
into
her
arms
nobody
can
make
out
what
she
is
nor
what
she
thinks
but
you
are
going
to
see
her
saval
began
to
laugh
and
said
you
are
in
love
with
her
no
i
am
on
the
list
which
is
not
precisely
the
same
thing
i
will
introduce
you
to
my
most
serious
rivals
but
the
chances
are
in
my
favor
i
am
in
the
lead
and
some
little
distinction
is
shown
to
me
you
are
in
love
saval
repeated
no
she
disquiets
me
seduces
and
disturbs
me
attracts
and
frightens
me
away
i
mistrust
her
as
i
would
a
trap
and
i
long
for
her
as
i
long
for
a
sherbet
when
i
am
thirsty
i
yield
to
her
charm
and
i
only
approach
her
with
the
apprehension
that
i
would
feel
concerning
a
man
who
was
known
to
be
a
skillful
thief
to
her
presence
i
have
an
irrational
impulse
toward
belief
in
her
possible
purity
and
a
very
reasonable
mistrust
of
her
not
less
probable
trickery
i
feel
myself
in
contact
with
an
abnormal
being
beyond
the
pale
of
natural
laws
an
exquisite
or
detestable
creature
i
do
know
which
for
the
third
time
saval
said
i
tell
you
that
you
are
in
love
you
speak
of
her
with
the
magniloquence
of
a
poet
and
the
feeling
of
a
troubadour
come
search
your
heart
and
confess
servigny
walked
a
few
steps
without
answering
then
he
replied
that
is
possible
after
all
in
any
case
she
fills
my
mind
almost
continually
yes
perhaps
i
am
in
love
i
dream
about
her
too
much
i
think
of
her
when
i
am
asleep
and
when
i
awake
that
is
surely
a
grave
indication
her
face
follows
me
accompanies
me
ceaselessly
ever
before
me
around
me
with
me
is
this
love
this
physical
infatuation
her
features
are
so
stamped
upon
my
vision
that
i
see
her
the
moment
i
shut
my
eyes
my
heart
beats
quickly
every
time
i
look
at
her
i
do
deny
it
so
i
am
in
love
with
her
but
in
a
queer
fashion
i
have
the
strongest
desire
for
her
and
yet
the
idea
of
making
her
my
wife
would
seem
to
me
a
folly
a
piece
of
stupidity
a
monstrous
thing
and
i
have
a
little
fear
of
her
as
well
the
fear
which
a
bird
feels
over
which
a
hawk
is
hovering
and
again
i
am
jealous
of
her
jealous
of
all
of
which
i
am
ignorant
in
her
incomprehensible
heart
i
am
always
wondering
she
a
charming
youngster
or
a
wretched
jade
she
says
things
that
would
make
an
army
shudder
but
so
does
a
parrot
she
is
at
times
so
indiscreet
and
yet
modest
that
i
am
forced
to
believe
in
her
spotless
purity
and
again
so
incredibly
artless
that
i
must
suspect
that
she
has
never
been
chaste
she
allures
me
excites
me
like
a
woman
of
a
certain
category
and
at
the
same
time
acts
like
an
impeccable
virgin
she
seems
to
love
me
and
yet
makes
fun
of
me
she
deports
herself
in
public
as
if
she
were
my
mistress
and
treats
me
in
private
as
if
i
were
her
brother
or
footman
there
are
times
when
i
fancy
that
she
has
as
many
lovers
as
her
mother
and
at
other
times
i
imagine
that
she
suspects
absolutely
nothing
of
that
sort
of
life
you
understand
furthermore
she
is
a
great
novel
reader
i
am
at
present
while
awaiting
something
better
her
book
purveyor
she
calls
me
her
every
week
the
new
book
store
sends
her
on
my
orders
everything
new
that
has
appeared
and
i
believe
that
she
reads
everything
at
random
it
must
make
a
strange
sort
of
mixture
in
her
head
that
kind
of
literary
accounts
perhaps
for
some
of
the
girl
peculiar
ways
when
a
young
woman
looks
at
existence
through
the
medium
of
fifteen
thousand
novels
she
must
see
it
in
a
strange
light
and
construct
queer
ideas
about
matters
and
things
in
general
as
for
me
i
am
waiting
it
is
certain
at
any
rate
that
i
never
have
had
for
any
other
woman
the
devotion
which
i
have
had
for
her
and
still
it
is
quite
certain
that
i
shall
never
marry
her
so
if
she
has
had
numbers
i
shall
swell
the
number
and
if
she
has
not
i
shall
take
the
first
ticket
just
as
i
would
do
for
a
street
car
the
case
is
very
simple
of
course
she
will
never
marry
who
in
the
world
would
marry
the
marquise
obardi
daughter
the
child
of
octavia
bardin
nobody
for
a
thousand
reasons
where
would
they
ever
find
a
husband
for
her
in
society
never
the
mother
house
is
a
sort
of
whose
patronage
is
attracted
by
the
daughter
girls
do
get
married
under
those
conditions
would
she
find
a
husband
among
the
still
less
would
that
be
possible
and
besides
the
marquise
is
not
the
woman
to
make
a
bad
bargain
she
will
give
yvette
only
to
a
man
of
high
position
and
that
man
she
will
never
discover
then
perhaps
she
will
look
among
the
common
people
still
less
likely
there
is
no
solution
of
the
problem
then
this
young
lady
belongs
neither
to
society
nor
to
the
tradesmen
class
nor
to
the
common
people
and
she
can
never
enter
any
of
these
ranks
by
marriage
she
belongs
through
her
mother
her
birth
her
education
her
inheritance
her
manners
and
her
customs
to
the
vortex
of
the
most
rapid
life
of
paris
she
can
never
escape
it
save
by
becoming
a
nun
which
is
not
at
all
probable
with
her
manners
and
tastes
she
has
only
one
possible
career
a
life
of
pleasure
she
will
come
to
it
sooner
or
later
if
indeed
she
has
not
already
begun
to
tread
its
primrose
path
she
can
not
escape
her
fate
from
being
a
young
girl
she
will
take
the
inevitable
step
quite
simply
and
i
would
like
to
be
the
pivot
of
this
transformation
i
am
waiting
there
are
many
lovers
you
will
see
among
them
a
frenchman
monsieur
de
belvigne
a
russian
called
prince
kravalow
and
an
italian
chevalier
valreali
who
have
all
announced
their
candidacies
and
who
are
consequently
maneuvering
to
the
best
of
their
ability
in
addition
to
these
there
are
several
freebooters
of
less
importance
the
marquise
waits
and
watches
but
i
think
that
she
has
views
about
me
she
knows
that
i
am
very
rich
and
she
makes
less
of
the
others
her
is
moreover
the
most
astounding
that
i
know
of
in
such
exhibitions
you
even
meet
very
decent
men
there
like
ourselves
as
for
the
women
she
has
culled
the
best
there
is
from
the
basket
of
pickpockets
nobody
knows
where
she
found
them
it
is
a
set
apart
from
bohemia
apart
from
everything
she
has
had
one
inspiration
showing
genius
and
that
is
the
knack
of
selecting
especially
those
adventuresses
who
have
children
generally
girls
so
that
a
fool
might
believe
that
in
her
house
he
was
among
respectable
women
they
had
reached
the
avenue
of
the
a
gentle
breeze
softly
stirred
the
leaves
and
touched
the
faces
of
like
the
breaths
of
a
giant
fan
waving
somewhere
in
the
sky
silent
shadows
wandered
beneath
the
trees
others
on
benches
made
a
dark
spot
and
these
shadows
spoke
very
low
as
if
they
were
telling
each
other
important
or
shameful
secrets
you
ca
imagine
what
a
collection
of
fictitious
titles
are
met
in
this
lair
said
servigny
by
the
way
i
shall
present
you
by
the
name
of
count
saval
plain
saval
would
not
do
at
all
oh
no
indeed
cried
his
friend
i
would
not
have
anyone
think
me
capable
of
borrowing
a
title
even
for
an
evening
even
among
those
people
ah
no
servigny
began
to
laugh
how
stupid
you
are
why
in
that
set
they
call
me
the
duke
de
servigny
i
do
know
how
nor
why
but
at
any
rate
the
duke
de
servigny
i
am
and
shall
remain
without
complaining
or
protesting
it
does
not
worry
me
i
should
have
no
footing
there
whatever
without
a
title
but
saval
would
not
be
convinced
well
you
are
of
rank
and
so
you
may
remain
but
as
for
me
no
i
shall
be
the
only
common
person
in
the
so
much
the
worse
or
so
much
the
better
it
will
be
my
mark
of
distinction
and
superiority
servigny
was
obstinate
i
tell
you
that
it
is
not
possible
why
it
would
almost
seem
monstrous
you
would
have
the
effect
of
a
ragman
at
a
meeting
of
emperors
let
me
do
as
i
like
i
shall
introduce
you
as
the
du
and
no
one
will
be
at
all
astonished
when
a
man
takes
on
greatness
he
ca
take
too
much
once
more
no
i
do
not
wish
it
very
well
have
your
way
but
in
fact
i
am
very
foolish
to
try
to
convince
you
i
defy
you
to
get
in
without
some
one
giving
you
a
title
just
as
they
give
a
bunch
of
violets
to
the
ladies
at
the
entrance
to
certain
stores
they
turned
to
the
right
in
the
rue
de
barrie
mounted
one
flight
of
stairs
in
a
fine
modern
house
and
gave
their
overcoats
and
canes
into
the
hands
of
four
servants
in
a
warm
odor
as
of
a
festival
assembly
filled
the
air
an
odor
of
flowers
perfumes
and
women
and
a
composed
and
continuous
murmur
came
from
the
adjoining
rooms
which
were
filled
with
people
a
kind
of
master
of
ceremonies
tall
erect
wide
of
girth
serious
his
face
framed
in
white
whiskers
approached
the
newcomers
asking
with
a
short
and
haughty
bow
whom
shall
i
announce
monsieur
saval
servigny
replied
then
with
a
loud
voice
the
man
opening
the
door
cried
out
to
the
crowd
of
guests
monsieur
the
duke
de
servigny
monsieur
the
baron
saval
the
first
was
filled
with
women
the
first
thing
which
attracted
attention
was
the
display
of
bare
shoulders
above
a
flood
of
brilliant
gowns
the
mistress
of
the
house
who
stood
talking
with
three
friends
turned
and
came
forward
with
a
majestic
step
with
grace
in
her
mien
and
a
smile
on
her
lips
her
forehead
was
narrow
and
very
low
and
was
covered
with
a
mass
of
glossy
black
hair
encroaching
a
little
upon
the
temples
she
was
tall
a
trifle
too
large
a
little
too
stout
over
ripe
but
very
pretty
with
a
heavy
warm
potent
beauty
beneath
that
mass
of
hair
full
of
dreams
and
smiles
rendering
her
mysteriously
captivating
were
enormous
black
eyes
her
nose
was
a
little
narrow
her
mouth
large
and
infinitely
seductive
made
to
speak
and
to
conquer
her
greatest
charm
was
in
her
voice
it
came
from
that
mouth
as
water
from
a
spring
so
natural
so
light
so
well
modulated
so
clear
that
there
was
a
physical
pleasure
in
listening
to
it
it
was
a
joy
for
the
ear
to
hear
the
flexible
words
flow
with
the
grace
of
a
babbling
brook
and
it
was
a
joy
for
the
eyes
to
see
those
pretty
lips
a
trifle
too
red
open
as
the
words
rippled
forth
she
gave
one
hand
to
servigny
who
kissed
it
and
dropping
her
fan
on
its
little
gold
chain
she
gave
the
other
to
saval
saying
to
him
you
are
welcome
baron
all
the
duke
friends
are
at
home
here
then
she
fixed
her
brilliant
eyes
upon
the
colossus
who
had
just
been
introduced
to
her
she
had
just
the
slightest
down
on
her
upper
lip
a
suspicion
of
a
mustache
which
seemed
darker
when
she
spoke
there
was
a
pleasant
odor
about
her
pervading
intoxicating
some
perfume
of
america
or
of
the
indies
other
people
came
in
marquesses
counts
or
princes
she
said
to
servigny
with
the
graciousness
of
a
mother
you
will
find
my
daughter
in
the
other
parlor
have
a
good
time
gentlemen
the
house
is
yours
and
she
left
them
to
go
to
those
who
had
come
later
throwing
at
saval
that
smiling
and
fleeting
glance
which
women
use
to
show
that
they
are
pleased
servigny
grasped
his
friend
arm
i
will
pilot
you
said
he
in
this
parlor
where
we
now
are
women
the
temples
of
the
fleshly
fresh
or
otherwise
bargains
as
good
as
new
even
better
for
sale
or
on
lease
at
the
right
gaming
the
temple
of
money
you
understand
all
about
that
at
the
lower
end
dancing
the
temple
of
innocence
the
sanctuary
the
market
for
young
girls
they
are
shown
off
there
in
every
light
even
legitimate
marriages
are
tolerated
it
is
the
future
the
hope
of
our
evenings
and
the
most
curious
part
of
this
museum
of
moral
diseases
are
these
young
girls
whose
souls
are
out
of
joint
just
like
the
limbs
of
the
little
clowns
born
of
mountebanks
come
and
look
at
them
he
bowed
right
and
left
courteously
a
compliment
on
his
lips
sweeping
each
woman
whom
he
knew
with
the
look
of
an
expert
the
musicians
at
the
end
of
the
second
parlor
were
playing
a
waltz
and
the
two
friends
stopped
at
the
door
to
look
at
them
a
score
of
couples
were
men
with
a
serious
expression
and
the
women
with
a
fixed
smile
on
their
lips
they
displayed
a
good
deal
of
shoulder
like
their
mothers
and
the
bodices
of
some
were
only
held
in
place
by
a
slender
ribbon
disclosing
at
times
more
than
is
generally
shown
suddenly
from
the
end
of
the
room
a
tall
girl
darted
forward
gliding
through
the
crowd
brushing
against
the
dancers
and
holding
her
long
train
in
her
left
hand
she
ran
with
quick
little
steps
as
women
do
in
crowds
and
called
out
ah
how
is
muscade
how
do
you
do
muscade
her
features
wore
an
expression
of
the
bloom
of
life
the
illumination
of
happiness
her
white
flesh
seemed
to
shine
the
flesh
which
goes
with
red
hair
the
mass
of
her
tresses
twisted
on
her
head
fiery
flaming
locks
nestled
against
her
supple
neck
which
was
still
a
little
thin
she
seemed
to
move
just
as
her
mother
was
made
to
speak
so
natural
noble
and
simple
were
her
gestures
a
person
felt
a
moral
joy
and
physical
pleasure
in
seeing
her
walk
stir
about
bend
her
head
or
lift
her
arm
ah
muscade
how
do
you
do
muscade
she
repeated
servigny
shook
her
hand
violently
as
he
would
a
man
and
said
mademoiselle
yvette
my
friend
baron
saval
good
evening
monsieur
are
you
always
as
tall
as
that
servigny
replied
in
that
bantering
tone
which
he
always
used
with
her
in
order
to
conceal
his
mistrust
and
his
uncertainty
no
he
has
put
on
his
greatest
dimensions
to
please
your
mother
who
loves
a
colossus
and
the
young
girl
remarked
with
a
comic
seriousness
very
well
but
when
you
come
to
see
me
you
must
diminish
a
little
if
you
please
i
prefer
the
medium
height
now
muscade
has
just
the
proportions
which
i
like
and
she
gave
her
hand
to
the
newcomer
then
she
asked
do
you
dance
muscade
come
let
us
waltz
without
replying
with
a
quick
movement
passionately
servigny
clasped
her
waist
and
they
disappeared
with
the
fury
of
a
whirlwind
they
danced
more
rapidly
than
any
of
the
others
whirled
and
whirled
and
turned
madly
so
close
together
that
they
seemed
but
one
and
with
the
form
erect
the
legs
almost
motionless
as
if
some
invisible
mechanism
concealed
beneath
their
feet
caused
them
to
twirl
they
appeared
tireless
the
other
dancers
stopped
from
time
to
time
they
still
danced
on
alone
they
seemed
not
to
know
where
they
were
nor
what
they
were
doing
as
if
they
had
gone
far
away
from
the
ball
in
an
ecstasy
the
musicians
continued
to
play
with
their
looks
fixed
upon
this
mad
couple
all
the
guests
gazed
at
them
and
when
finally
they
did
stop
dancing
everyone
applauded
them
she
was
a
little
flushed
with
strange
eyes
ardent
and
timid
less
daring
than
a
moment
before
troubled
eyes
blue
yet
with
a
pupil
so
black
that
they
seemed
hardly
natural
servigny
appeared
giddy
he
leaned
against
a
door
to
regain
his
composure
you
have
no
head
my
poor
muscade
i
am
steadier
than
you
said
yvette
to
servigny
he
smiled
nervously
and
devoured
her
with
a
look
his
animal
feelings
revealed
themselves
in
his
eyes
and
in
the
curl
of
his
lips
she
stood
beside
him
looking
down
and
her
bosom
rose
and
fell
in
short
gasps
as
he
looked
at
her
then
she
said
softly
really
there
are
times
when
you
are
like
a
tiger
about
to
spring
upon
his
prey
come
give
me
your
arm
and
let
us
find
your
friend
silently
he
offered
her
his
arm
and
they
went
down
the
long
together
saval
was
not
alone
for
the
marquise
obardi
had
rejoined
him
she
conversed
with
him
on
ordinary
and
fashionable
subjects
with
a
seductiveness
in
her
tones
which
intoxicated
him
and
looking
at
her
with
his
mental
eye
it
seemed
to
him
that
her
lips
uttered
words
far
different
from
those
which
they
formed
when
she
saw
servigny
her
face
immediately
lighted
up
and
turning
toward
him
she
said
you
know
my
dear
duke
that
i
have
just
leased
a
villa
at
bougival
for
two
months
and
i
count
upon
your
coming
to
see
me
there
and
upon
your
friend
also
listen
we
take
possession
next
monday
and
shall
expect
both
of
you
to
dinner
the
following
saturday
we
shall
keep
you
over
sunday
perfectly
serene
and
tranquil
yvette
smiled
saying
with
a
decision
which
swept
away
hesitation
on
his
part
of
course
muscade
will
come
to
dinner
on
saturday
we
have
only
to
ask
him
for
he
and
i
intend
to
commit
a
lot
of
follies
in
the
country
he
thought
he
divined
the
birth
of
a
promise
in
her
smile
and
in
her
voice
he
heard
what
he
thought
was
invitation
then
the
marquise
turned
her
big
black
eyes
upon
saval
and
you
will
of
course
come
baron
with
a
smile
that
forbade
doubt
he
bent
toward
her
saying
i
shall
be
only
too
charmed
madame
then
yvette
murmured
with
malice
that
was
either
naive
or
traitorous
we
will
set
all
the
world
by
the
ears
down
there
we
muscade
and
make
my
regiment
of
admirers
fairly
mad
and
with
a
look
she
pointed
out
a
group
of
men
who
were
looking
at
them
from
a
little
distance
said
servigny
to
her
as
many
follies
as
you
may
please
in
speaking
to
yvette
servigny
never
used
the
word
mademoiselle
by
reason
of
his
close
and
long
intimacy
with
her
then
saval
asked
why
does
mademoiselle
always
call
my
friend
servigny
yvette
assumed
a
very
frank
air
and
said
i
will
tell
you
it
is
because
he
always
slips
through
my
hands
now
i
think
i
have
him
and
then
i
find
i
have
not
the
marquise
with
her
eyes
upon
saval
arid
evidently
preoccupied
said
in
a
careless
tone
you
children
are
very
funny
but
yvette
bridled
up
i
do
not
intend
to
be
funny
i
am
simply
frank
muscade
pleases
me
and
is
always
deserting
me
and
that
is
what
annoys
me
servigny
bowed
profoundly
saying
i
will
never
leave
you
any
more
neither
day
nor
night
she
made
a
gesture
of
horror
my
goodness
no
what
do
you
mean
you
are
all
right
during
the
day
but
at
night
you
might
embarrass
me
with
an
air
of
impertinence
he
asked
and
why
yvette
responded
calmly
and
audaciously
because
you
would
not
look
well
en
deshabille
the
marquise
without
appearing
at
all
disturbed
said
what
extraordinary
subjects
for
conversation
one
would
think
that
you
were
not
at
all
ignorant
of
such
things
and
servigny
jokingly
added
that
is
also
my
opinion
marquise
yvette
turned
her
eyes
upon
him
and
in
a
haughty
yet
wounded
tone
said
you
are
becoming
very
vulgar
just
as
you
have
been
several
times
lately
and
turning
quickly
she
appealed
to
an
individual
standing
by
chevalier
come
and
defend
me
from
insult
a
thin
brown
man
with
an
easy
carriage
came
forward
who
is
the
culprit
said
he
with
a
constrained
smile
yvette
pointed
out
servigny
with
a
nod
of
her
head
there
he
is
but
i
like
him
better
than
i
do
you
because
he
is
less
of
a
bore
the
chevalier
valreali
bowed
i
do
what
i
can
mademoiselle
i
may
have
less
ability
but
not
less
devotion
a
gentleman
came
forward
tall
and
stout
with
gray
whiskers
saying
in
loud
tones
mademoiselle
yvette
i
am
your
most
devoted
slave
yvette
cried
ah
monsieur
de
belvigne
then
turning
toward
saval
she
introduced
him
my
last
adorer
big
fat
rich
and
stupid
those
are
the
kind
i
like
a
veritable
but
of
the
table
but
see
you
are
still
bigger
than
he
how
shall
i
nickname
you
good
i
have
it
i
shall
call
you
colossus
of
rhodes
junior
from
the
colossus
who
certainly
was
your
father
but
you
two
ought
to
have
very
interesting
things
to
say
to
each
other
up
there
above
the
heads
of
us
all
so
and
she
left
them
quickly
going
to
the
orchestra
to
make
the
musicians
strike
up
a
quadrille
madame
obardi
seemed
preoccupied
in
a
soft
voice
she
said
to
servigny
you
are
always
teasing
her
you
will
warp
her
character
and
bring
out
many
bad
traits
servigny
replies
why
have
you
finished
her
education
she
appeared
not
to
understand
and
continued
talking
in
a
friendly
way
but
she
noticed
a
solemn
looking
man
wearing
a
perfect
constellation
of
crosses
and
orders
standing
near
her
and
she
ran
to
him
ah
prince
prince
what
good
fortune
servigny
took
saval
arm
and
drew
him
away
that
is
the
latest
serious
suitor
prince
kravalow
is
she
superb
to
my
mind
they
are
both
superb
the
mother
would
suffice
for
me
perfectly
answered
saval
servigny
nodded
and
said
at
your
disposal
my
dear
boy
the
dancers
elbowed
them
aside
as
they
were
forming
for
a
quadrille
now
let
us
go
and
see
the
sharpers
said
servigny
and
they
entered
the
around
each
table
stood
a
group
of
men
looking
on
there
was
very
little
conversation
at
times
the
clink
of
gold
coins
tossed
upon
the
green
cloth
or
hastily
seized
added
its
sound
to
the
murmur
of
the
players
just
as
if
the
money
was
putting
in
its
word
among
the
human
voices
all
the
men
were
decorated
with
various
orders
and
odd
ribbons
and
they
all
wore
the
same
severe
expression
with
different
countenances
the
especially
distinguishing
feature
was
the
beard
the
stiff
american
with
his
horseshoe
the
haughty
englishman
with
his
open
on
his
breast
the
spaniard
with
his
black
fleece
reaching
to
the
eyes
the
roman
with
that
huge
mustache
which
italy
copied
from
victor
emmanuel
the
austrian
with
his
whiskers
and
shaved
chin
a
russian
general
whose
lip
seemed
armed
with
two
twisted
lances
and
a
frenchman
with
a
dainty
mustache
displayed
the
fancies
of
all
the
barbers
in
the
world
you
wo
join
the
game
asked
servigny
no
shall
you
not
now
if
you
are
ready
to
go
we
will
come
back
some
quieter
day
there
are
too
many
people
here
and
we
ca
do
anything
well
let
us
go
and
they
disappeared
behind
a
into
the
hall
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
street
servigny
asked
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
it
certainly
is
interesting
but
i
fancy
the
women
side
of
it
more
than
the
men
indeed
those
women
are
the
best
of
the
tribe
for
us
do
you
find
that
you
breathe
the
odor
of
love
among
them
just
as
you
scent
the
perfumes
at
a
hairdresser
really
such
houses
are
the
place
for
one
to
go
and
what
experts
my
dear
fellow
what
artists
have
you
ever
eaten
bakers
cakes
they
look
well
but
they
amount
to
nothing
the
man
who
bakes
them
only
knows
how
to
make
bread
well
the
love
of
a
woman
in
ordinary
society
always
reminds
me
of
these
trifles
while
the
love
you
find
at
houses
like
the
marquise
obardi
do
you
see
is
the
real
sweetmeat
oh
they
know
how
to
make
cakes
these
charming
only
you
pay
five
sous
at
their
shops
for
what
costs
two
sous
elsewhere
who
is
the
master
of
the
house
just
now
asked
saval
servigny
shrugged
his
shoulders
signifying
his
ignorance
i
do
know
the
latest
one
known
was
an
english
peer
but
he
left
three
months
ago
at
present
she
must
live
off
the
common
herd
or
the
gambling
perhaps
and
on
the
gamblers
for
she
has
her
caprices
but
tell
me
it
is
understood
that
we
dine
with
her
on
saturday
at
bougival
is
it
not
people
are
more
free
in
the
country
and
i
shall
succeed
in
finding
out
what
ideas
yvette
has
in
her
head
i
should
like
nothing
better
replied
saval
i
have
nothing
to
do
that
day
passing
down
through
the
under
the
steps
they
disturbed
a
couple
making
love
on
one
of
the
benches
and
servigny
muttered
what
foolishness
and
what
a
serious
matter
at
the
same
time
how
commonplace
and
amusing
love
is
always
the
same
and
always
different
and
the
beggar
who
gives
his
sweetheart
twenty
sous
gets
as
much
return
as
i
would
for
ten
thousand
francs
from
some
obardi
no
younger
and
no
less
stupid
perhaps
than
this
nondescript
what
nonsense
he
said
nothing
for
a
few
minutes
then
he
began
again
all
the
same
it
would
be
good
to
become
yvette
first
lover
oh
for
that
i
would
give
he
did
not
add
what
he
would
give
and
saval
said
good
night
to
him
as
they
reached
the
corner
of
the
rue
royale
chapter
ii
bougival
and
love
they
had
set
the
table
on
the
veranda
which
overlooked
the
river
the
printemps
villa
leased
by
the
marquise
obardi
was
halfway
up
this
hill
just
at
the
corner
of
the
seine
which
turned
before
the
garden
wall
flowing
toward
marly
opposite
the
residence
the
island
of
croissy
formed
a
horizon
of
tall
trees
a
mass
of
verdure
and
they
could
see
a
long
stretch
of
the
big
river
as
far
as
the
floating
cafe
of
la
grenouillere
hidden
beneath
the
foliage
the
evening
fell
one
of
those
calm
evenings
at
the
waterside
full
of
color
yet
soft
one
of
those
peaceful
evenings
which
produces
a
sensation
of
pleasure
no
breath
of
air
stirred
the
branches
no
shiver
of
wind
ruffled
the
smooth
clear
surface
of
the
seine
it
was
not
too
warm
it
was
mild
good
weather
to
live
in
the
grateful
coolness
of
the
banks
of
the
seine
rose
toward
a
serene
sky
the
sun
disappeared
behind
the
trees
to
shine
on
other
lands
and
one
seemed
to
absorb
the
serenity
of
the
already
sleeping
earth
to
inhale
in
the
peace
of
space
the
life
of
the
infinite
as
they
left
the
to
seat
themselves
at
the
table
everyone
was
joyous
a
softened
gaiety
filled
their
hearts
they
felt
that
it
would
be
so
delightful
to
dine
there
in
the
country
with
that
great
river
and
that
twilight
for
a
setting
breathing
that
pure
and
fragrant
air
the
marquise
had
taken
saval
arm
and
yvette
servigny
the
four
were
alone
by
themselves
the
two
women
seemed
entirely
different
persons
from
what
they
were
at
paris
especially
yvette
she
talked
but
little
and
seemed
languid
and
grave
saval
hardly
recognizing
her
in
this
frame
of
mind
asked
her
what
is
the
matter
mademoiselle
i
find
you
changed
since
last
week
you
have
become
quite
a
serious
person
it
is
the
country
that
does
that
for
me
she
replied
i
am
not
the
same
i
feel
queer
besides
i
am
never
two
days
alike
i
have
the
air
of
a
mad
woman
and
shall
be
as
grave
as
an
elegy
i
change
with
the
weather
i
do
know
why
you
see
i
am
capable
of
anything
according
to
the
moment
there
are
days
when
i
would
like
to
kill
people
not
animals
i
would
never
kill
animals
but
people
yes
and
other
days
when
i
weep
at
a
mere
thing
a
lot
of
different
ideas
pass
through
my
head
it
depends
too
a
good
deal
on
how
i
get
up
every
morning
on
waking
i
can
tell
just
what
i
shall
be
in
the
evening
perhaps
it
is
our
dreams
that
settle
it
for
us
and
it
depends
on
the
book
i
have
just
read
she
was
clad
in
a
white
flannel
suit
which
delicately
enveloped
her
in
the
floating
softness
of
the
material
her
bodice
with
full
folds
suggested
without
displaying
and
without
restraining
her
free
chest
which
was
firm
and
already
ripe
and
her
superb
neck
emerged
from
a
froth
of
soft
lace
bending
with
gentle
movements
fairer
than
her
gown
a
pilaster
of
flesh
bearing
the
heavy
mass
of
her
golden
hair
servigny
looked
at
her
for
a
long
time
you
are
adorable
this
evening
said
he
i
wish
i
could
always
see
you
like
this
do
make
a
declaration
muscade
i
should
take
it
seriously
and
that
might
cost
you
dear
the
marquise
seemed
happy
very
happy
all
in
black
richly
dressed
in
a
plain
gown
which
showed
her
strong
full
lines
a
bit
of
red
at
the
bodice
a
cincture
of
red
carnations
falling
from
her
waist
like
a
chain
and
fastened
at
the
hips
and
a
red
rose
in
her
dark
hair
she
carried
in
all
her
person
something
fervid
in
that
simple
costume
in
those
flowers
which
seemed
to
bleed
in
her
look
in
her
slow
speech
in
her
peculiar
gestures
saval
too
appeared
serious
and
absorbed
from
time
to
time
he
stroked
his
pointed
beard
trimmed
in
the
fashion
of
henri
and
seemed
to
be
meditating
on
the
most
profound
subjects
nobody
spoke
for
several
minutes
then
as
they
were
serving
the
trout
servigny
remarked
silence
is
a
good
thing
at
times
people
are
often
nearer
to
each
other
when
they
are
keeping
still
than
when
they
are
talking
that
so
marquise
she
turned
a
little
toward
him
and
answered
it
is
quite
true
it
is
so
sweet
to
think
together
about
agreeable
things
she
raised
her
warm
glance
toward
saval
and
they
continued
for
some
seconds
looking
into
each
other
eyes
a
slight
almost
inaudible
movement
took
place
beneath
the
table
servigny
resumed
yvette
you
will
make
me
believe
that
you
are
in
love
if
you
keep
on
being
as
good
as
that
now
with
whom
could
you
be
in
love
let
us
think
together
if
you
will
i
put
aside
the
army
of
vulgar
sighers
i
only
take
the
principal
ones
is
it
prince
kravalow
at
this
name
yvette
awoke
my
poor
muscade
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
why
the
prince
has
the
air
of
a
russian
in
a
museum
who
has
won
medals
in
a
hairdressing
competition
good
we
drop
the
prince
but
you
have
noticed
the
viscount
pierre
de
belvigne
this
time
she
began
to
laugh
and
asked
can
you
imagine
me
hanging
to
the
neck
of
she
nicknamed
him
according
to
the
day
raisine
malvoisie
footnote
preserved
grapes
and
pears
malmsey
a
poor
wine
argenteuil
for
she
gave
everybody
nicknames
and
she
would
murmur
to
his
face
my
dear
little
pierre
or
my
divine
pedro
darling
pierrot
give
your
head
to
your
dear
little
girl
who
wants
to
kiss
it
scratch
out
number
two
there
still
remains
the
chevalier
valreali
whom
the
marquise
seems
to
favor
continued
servigny
yvette
regained
all
her
gaiety
why
he
weeps
like
a
magdalene
he
goes
to
all
the
funerals
i
imagine
myself
dead
every
time
he
looks
at
me
that
settles
the
third
so
the
lightning
will
strike
baron
saval
here
monsieur
the
colossus
of
rhodes
junior
no
he
is
too
strong
it
would
seem
to
me
as
if
i
were
in
love
with
the
triumphal
arch
of
then
it
is
beyond
doubt
that
you
are
in
love
with
me
for
i
am
the
only
one
of
your
adorers
of
whom
we
have
not
yet
spoken
i
left
myself
for
the
last
through
modesty
and
through
discretion
it
remains
for
me
to
thank
you
she
replied
with
happy
grace
in
love
with
you
muscade
ah
no
i
like
you
but
i
do
love
you
wait
i
i
do
want
to
discourage
you
i
do
love
you
yet
you
have
a
chance
perhaps
persevere
muscade
be
devoted
ardent
submissive
full
of
little
attentions
and
considerations
docile
to
my
slightest
caprices
ready
for
anything
to
please
me
and
we
shall
see
later
but
i
would
rather
furnish
all
you
demand
afterward
than
beforehand
if
it
be
the
same
to
you
she
asked
with
an
artless
air
after
what
muscade
after
you
have
shown
me
that
you
love
me
by
jove
well
act
as
if
i
loved
you
and
believe
it
if
you
wish
but
you
be
quiet
muscade
enough
on
the
subject
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
the
island
but
the
whole
sky
still
flamed
like
a
fire
and
the
peaceful
water
of
the
river
seemed
changed
to
blood
the
reflections
from
the
horizon
reddened
houses
objects
and
persons
the
scarlet
rose
in
the
marquise
hair
had
the
appearance
of
a
splash
of
purple
fallen
from
the
clouds
upon
her
head
as
yvette
looked
on
from
her
end
the
marquise
rested
as
if
by
carelessness
her
bare
hand
upon
saval
hand
but
the
young
girl
made
a
motion
and
the
marquise
withdrew
her
hand
with
a
quick
gesture
pretending
to
readjust
something
in
the
folds
of
her
corsage
servigny
who
was
looking
at
them
said
if
you
like
we
will
take
a
walk
on
the
island
after
dinner
oh
yes
that
will
be
delightful
we
will
go
all
alone
wo
we
muscade
yes
all
alone
the
vast
silence
of
the
horizon
the
sleepy
tranquillity
of
the
evening
captured
heart
body
and
voice
there
are
peaceful
chosen
hours
when
it
becomes
almost
impossible
to
talk
the
servants
waited
on
them
noiselessly
the
firmamental
conflagration
faded
away
and
the
soft
night
spread
its
shadows
over
the
earth
are
you
going
to
stay
long
in
this
place
asked
saval
and
the
marquise
answered
dwelling
on
each
word
yes
as
long
as
i
am
happy
as
it
was
too
dark
to
see
lamps
were
brought
they
cast
upon
the
table
a
strange
pale
gleam
beneath
the
great
obscurity
of
space
and
very
soon
a
shower
of
gnats
fell
upon
the
tablecloth
the
tiny
gnats
which
immolate
themselves
by
passing
over
the
glass
chimneys
and
with
wings
and
legs
scorched
powder
the
table
linen
dishes
and
cups
with
a
kind
of
gray
and
hopping
dust
they
swallowed
them
in
the
wine
they
ate
them
in
the
sauces
they
saw
them
moving
on
the
bread
and
had
their
faces
and
hands
tickled
by
the
countless
swarm
of
these
tiny
insects
they
were
continually
compelled
to
throw
away
the
beverages
to
cover
the
plates
and
while
eating
to
shield
the
food
with
infinite
precautions
it
amused
yvette
servigny
took
care
to
shelter
what
she
bore
to
her
mouth
to
guard
her
glass
to
hold
his
handkerchief
stretched
out
over
her
head
like
a
roof
but
the
marquise
disgusted
became
nervous
and
the
end
of
the
dinner
came
quickly
yvette
who
had
not
forgotten
servigny
proposition
said
to
him
now
we
go
to
the
island
her
mother
cautioned
her
in
a
languid
tone
do
be
late
above
all
things
we
will
escort
you
to
the
ferry
and
they
started
in
couples
the
young
girl
and
her
admirer
walking
in
front
on
the
road
to
the
shore
they
heard
behind
them
the
marquise
and
saval
speaking
very
rapidly
in
low
tones
all
was
dark
with
a
thick
inky
darkness
but
the
sky
swarmed
with
grains
of
fire
and
seemed
to
sow
them
in
the
river
for
the
black
water
was
flecked
with
stars
the
frogs
were
croaking
monotonously
upon
the
bank
and
numerous
nightingales
were
uttering
their
low
sweet
song
in
the
calm
and
peaceful
air
yvette
suddenly
said
gracious
they
are
not
walking
behind
us
any
more
where
are
they
and
she
called
out
mamma
no
voice
replied
the
young
girl
resumed
at
any
rate
they
ca
be
far
away
for
i
heard
them
just
now
servigny
murmured
they
must
have
gone
back
your
mother
was
cold
perhaps
and
he
drew
her
along
before
them
a
light
gleamed
it
was
the
tavern
of
martinet
and
fisherman
at
their
call
a
man
came
out
of
the
house
and
they
got
into
a
large
boat
which
was
moored
among
the
weeds
of
the
shore
the
ferryman
took
his
oars
and
the
unwieldy
barge
as
it
advanced
disturbed
the
sleeping
stars
upon
the
water
and
set
them
into
a
mad
dance
which
gradually
calmed
down
after
they
had
passed
they
touched
the
other
shore
and
disembarked
beneath
the
great
trees
a
cool
freshness
of
damp
earth
permeated
the
air
under
the
lofty
and
clustered
branches
where
there
seemed
to
be
as
many
nightingales
as
there
were
leaves
a
distant
piano
began
to
play
a
popular
waltz
servigny
took
yvette
arm
and
very
gently
slipped
his
hand
around
her
waist
and
gave
her
a
slight
hug
what
are
you
thinking
about
he
said
i
about
nothing
at
all
i
am
very
happy
then
you
do
love
me
oh
yes
muscade
i
love
you
i
love
you
a
great
deal
only
leave
me
alone
it
is
too
beautiful
here
to
listen
to
your
nonsense
he
drew
her
toward
him
although
she
tried
by
little
pushes
to
extricate
herself
and
through
her
soft
flannel
gown
he
felt
the
warmth
of
her
flesh
he
stammered
yvette
well
what
i
do
love
you
but
you
are
not
in
earnest
muscade
oh
yes
i
am
i
have
loved
you
for
a
long
time
she
continually
kept
trying
to
separate
herself
from
him
trying
to
release
the
arm
crushed
between
their
bodies
they
walked
with
difficulty
trammeled
by
this
bond
and
by
these
movements
and
went
zigzagging
along
like
drunken
folk
he
knew
not
what
to
say
to
her
feeling
that
he
could
not
talk
to
a
young
girl
as
he
would
to
a
woman
he
was
perplexed
thinking
what
he
ought
to
do
wondering
if
she
consented
or
did
not
understand
and
curbing
his
spirit
to
find
just
the
right
tender
and
decisive
words
he
kept
saying
every
second
yvette
speak
yvette
then
suddenly
risking
all
he
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
she
gave
a
little
start
aside
and
said
with
a
vexed
air
oh
you
are
absurd
are
you
going
to
let
me
alone
the
tone
of
her
voice
did
not
at
all
reveal
her
thoughts
nor
her
wishes
and
not
seeing
her
too
angry
he
applied
his
lips
to
the
beginning
of
her
neck
just
beneath
the
golden
hair
that
charming
spot
which
he
had
so
often
coveted
then
she
made
great
efforts
to
free
herself
but
he
held
her
strongly
and
placing
his
other
hand
on
her
shoulder
he
compelled
her
to
turn
her
head
toward
him
and
gave
her
a
fond
passionate
kiss
squarely
on
the
mouth
she
slipped
from
his
arms
by
a
quick
undulation
of
the
body
and
free
from
his
grasp
she
disappeared
into
the
darkness
with
a
great
swishing
of
skirts
like
the
whir
of
a
bird
as
it
flies
away
he
stood
motionless
a
moment
surprised
by
her
suppleness
and
her
disappearance
then
hearing
nothing
he
called
gently
yvette
she
did
not
reply
he
began
to
walk
forward
peering
through
the
shadows
looking
in
the
underbrush
for
the
white
spot
her
dress
should
make
all
was
dark
he
cried
out
more
loudly
yvette
yvette
nothing
stirred
he
stopped
and
listened
the
whole
island
was
still
there
was
scarcely
a
rustle
of
leaves
over
his
head
the
frogs
alone
continued
their
deep
croakings
on
the
shores
then
he
wandered
from
thicket
to
thicket
going
where
the
banks
were
steep
and
bushy
and
returning
to
places
where
they
were
flat
and
bare
as
a
dead
man
arm
he
proceeded
until
he
was
opposite
bougival
and
reached
the
establishment
of
la
grenouillere
groping
the
clumps
of
trees
calling
out
continually
yvette
where
are
you
answer
it
is
ridiculous
come
answer
do
keep
me
hunting
like
this
a
distant
clock
began
to
strike
he
counted
the
hours
twelve
he
had
been
searching
through
the
island
for
two
hours
then
he
thought
that
perhaps
she
had
gone
home
and
he
went
back
very
anxiously
this
time
by
way
of
the
bridge
a
servant
dozing
on
a
chair
was
waiting
in
the
hall
servigny
awakened
him
and
asked
is
it
long
since
mademoiselle
yvette
came
home
i
left
her
at
the
foot
of
the
place
because
i
had
a
call
to
make
and
the
valet
replied
oh
yes
monsieur
mademoiselle
came
in
before
ten
he
proceeded
to
his
room
and
went
to
bed
but
he
could
not
close
his
eyes
that
stolen
kiss
had
stirred
him
to
the
soul
he
kept
wondering
what
she
thought
and
what
she
knew
how
pretty
and
attractive
she
was
his
desires
somewhat
wearied
by
the
life
he
led
by
all
his
procession
of
sweethearts
by
all
his
explorations
in
the
kingdom
of
love
awoke
before
this
singular
child
so
fresh
irritating
and
inexplicable
he
heard
one
strike
then
two
he
could
not
sleep
at
all
he
was
warm
he
felt
his
heart
beat
and
his
temples
throb
and
he
rose
to
open
the
window
a
breath
of
fresh
air
came
in
which
he
inhaled
deeply
the
thick
darkness
was
silent
black
motionless
but
suddenly
he
perceived
before
him
in
the
shadows
of
the
garden
a
shining
point
it
seemed
a
little
red
coal
well
a
cigar
he
said
to
himself
it
must
be
saval
and
he
called
softly
leon
is
it
you
jean
yes
wait
i
come
down
he
dressed
went
out
and
rejoining
his
friend
who
was
smoking
astride
an
iron
chair
inquired
what
are
you
doing
here
at
this
hour
i
am
resting
saval
replied
and
he
began
to
laugh
servigny
pressed
his
hand
my
compliments
my
dear
fellow
and
as
for
me
i
am
making
a
fool
of
myself
you
mean
i
mean
that
yvette
and
her
mother
do
not
resemble
each
other
what
has
happened
tell
me
servigny
recounted
his
attempts
and
their
failure
then
he
resumed
decidedly
that
little
girl
worries
me
fancy
my
not
being
able
to
sleep
what
a
queer
thing
a
girl
is
she
appears
to
be
as
simple
as
anything
and
yet
you
know
nothing
about
her
a
woman
who
has
lived
and
loved
who
knows
life
can
be
quickly
understood
but
when
it
comes
to
a
young
virgin
on
the
contrary
no
one
can
guess
anything
about
her
at
heart
i
begin
to
think
that
she
is
making
sport
of
me
saval
tilted
his
chair
he
said
very
slowly
take
care
my
dear
fellow
she
will
lead
you
to
marriage
remember
those
other
illustrious
examples
it
was
just
by
this
same
process
that
mademoiselle
de
montijo
who
was
at
least
of
good
family
became
empress
do
play
napoleon
servigny
murmured
as
for
that
fear
nothing
i
am
neither
a
simpleton
nor
an
emperor
a
man
must
be
either
one
or
the
other
to
make
such
a
move
as
that
but
tell
me
are
you
sleepy
not
a
bit
will
you
take
a
walk
along
the
river
gladly
they
opened
the
iron
gate
and
began
to
walk
along
the
river
bank
toward
marly
it
was
the
quiet
hour
which
precedes
dawn
the
hour
of
deep
sleep
of
complete
rest
of
profound
peacefulness
even
the
gentle
sounds
of
the
night
were
hushed
the
nightingales
sang
no
longer
the
frogs
had
finished
their
hubbub
some
kind
of
an
animal
only
probably
a
bird
was
making
somewhere
a
kind
of
sawing
sound
feeble
monotonous
and
regular
as
a
machine
servigny
who
had
moments
of
poetry
and
of
philosophy
too
suddenly
remarked
now
this
girl
completely
puzzles
me
in
arithmetic
one
and
one
make
two
in
love
one
and
one
ought
to
make
one
but
they
make
two
just
the
same
have
you
ever
felt
that
that
need
of
absorbing
a
woman
in
yourself
or
disappearing
in
her
i
am
not
speaking
of
the
animal
embrace
but
of
that
moral
and
mental
eagerness
to
be
but
one
with
a
being
to
open
to
her
all
one
heart
and
soul
and
to
fathom
her
thoughts
to
the
depths
and
yet
you
can
never
lay
bare
all
the
fluctuations
of
her
wishes
desires
and
opinions
you
can
never
guess
even
slightly
all
the
unknown
currents
all
the
mystery
of
a
soul
that
seems
so
near
a
soul
hidden
behind
two
eyes
that
look
at
you
clear
as
water
transparent
as
if
there
were
nothing
beneath
a
soul
which
talks
to
you
by
a
beloved
mouth
which
seems
your
very
own
so
greatly
do
you
desire
it
a
soul
which
throws
you
by
words
its
thoughts
one
by
one
and
which
nevertheless
remains
further
away
from
you
than
those
stars
are
from
each
other
and
more
impenetrable
is
it
queer
all
that
i
do
ask
so
much
saval
rejoined
i
do
look
behind
the
eyes
i
care
little
for
the
contents
but
much
for
the
vessel
and
servigny
replied
what
a
singular
person
yvette
is
how
will
she
receive
me
this
morning
as
they
reached
the
works
at
marly
they
perceived
that
the
sky
was
brightening
the
cocks
began
to
crow
in
the
a
bird
twittered
in
a
park
at
the
left
ceaselessly
reiterating
a
tender
little
theme
it
is
time
to
go
back
said
saval
they
returned
and
as
servigny
entered
his
room
he
saw
the
horizon
all
pink
through
his
open
windows
then
he
shut
the
blinds
drew
the
thick
heavy
curtains
went
back
to
bed
and
fell
asleep
he
dreamed
of
yvette
all
through
his
slumber
an
odd
noise
awoke
him
he
sat
on
the
side
of
the
bed
and
listened
but
heard
nothing
further
then
suddenly
there
was
a
crackling
against
the
blinds
like
falling
hail
he
jumped
from
the
bed
ran
to
the
window
opened
it
and
saw
yvette
standing
in
the
path
and
throwing
handfuls
of
gravel
at
his
face
she
was
clad
in
pink
with
a
straw
hat
ornamented
with
a
mousquetaire
plume
and
was
laughing
mischievously
well
muscade
are
you
asleep
what
could
you
have
been
doing
all
night
to
make
you
wake
so
late
have
you
been
seeking
adventures
my
poor
muscade
he
was
dazzled
by
the
bright
daylight
striking
him
full
in
the
eyes
still
overwhelmed
with
fatigue
and
surprised
at
the
jesting
tranquillity
of
the
young
girl
i
be
down
in
a
second
he
answered
just
time
to
splash
my
face
with
water
and
i
will
join
you
hurry
she
cried
it
is
ten
and
besides
i
have
a
great
plan
to
unfold
to
you
a
plot
we
are
going
to
concoct
you
know
that
we
breakfast
at
eleven
he
found
her
seated
on
a
bench
with
a
book
in
her
lap
some
novel
or
other
she
took
his
arm
in
a
familiar
and
friendly
way
with
a
frank
and
gay
manner
as
if
nothing
had
happened
the
night
before
and
drew
him
toward
the
end
of
the
garden
this
is
my
plan
she
said
we
will
disobey
mamma
and
you
shall
take
me
presently
to
la
grenouillere
restaurant
i
want
to
see
it
mamma
says
that
decent
women
can
not
go
to
the
place
now
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
whether
persons
can
go
there
or
can
not
you
take
me
wo
you
muscade
and
we
will
have
a
great
time
with
the
boatmen
she
exhaled
a
delicious
fragrance
although
he
could
not
exactly
define
just
what
light
and
vague
odor
enveloped
her
it
was
not
one
of
those
heavy
perfumes
of
her
mother
but
a
discreet
breath
in
which
he
fancied
he
could
detect
a
suspicion
of
iris
powder
and
perhaps
a
suggestion
of
vervain
whence
emanated
that
indiscernible
perfume
from
her
dress
her
hair
or
her
skin
he
puzzled
over
this
and
as
he
was
speaking
very
close
to
her
he
received
full
in
the
face
her
fresh
breath
which
seemed
to
him
just
as
delicious
to
inhale
then
he
thought
that
this
evasive
perfume
which
he
was
trying
to
recognize
was
perhaps
only
evoked
by
her
charming
eyes
and
was
merely
a
sort
of
deceptive
emanation
of
her
young
and
alluring
grace
that
is
agreed
is
it
muscade
as
it
will
be
very
warm
after
breakfast
mamma
will
not
go
out
she
always
feels
the
heat
very
much
we
will
leave
her
with
your
friend
and
you
shall
take
me
they
will
think
that
we
have
gone
into
the
forest
if
you
knew
how
much
it
will
amuse
me
to
see
la
grenouillere
they
reached
the
iron
gate
opposite
the
seine
a
flood
of
sunshine
fell
upon
the
slumberous
shining
river
a
slight
rose
from
it
a
sort
of
haze
of
evaporated
water
which
spread
over
the
surface
of
the
stream
a
faint
gleaming
vapor
from
time
to
time
boats
passed
by
a
quick
yawl
or
a
heavy
passage
boat
and
short
or
long
whistles
could
be
heard
those
of
the
trains
which
every
sunday
poured
the
citizens
of
paris
into
the
suburbs
and
those
of
the
steamboats
signaling
their
approach
to
pass
the
locks
at
marly
but
a
tiny
bell
sounded
breakfast
was
announced
and
they
went
back
into
the
house
the
repast
was
a
silent
one
a
heavy
july
noon
overwhelmed
the
earth
and
oppressed
humanity
the
heat
seemed
thick
and
paralyzed
both
mind
and
body
the
sluggish
words
would
not
leave
the
lips
and
all
motion
seemed
laborious
as
if
the
air
had
become
a
resisting
medium
difficult
to
traverse
only
yvette
although
silent
seemed
animated
and
nervous
with
impatience
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
the
last
course
she
said
if
we
were
to
go
for
a
walk
in
the
forest
it
would
be
deliciously
cool
under
the
trees
the
marquise
murmured
with
a
listless
air
are
you
mad
does
anyone
go
out
in
such
weather
and
the
young
girl
delighted
rejoined
oh
well
we
will
leave
the
baron
to
keep
you
company
muscade
and
i
will
climb
the
hill
and
sit
on
the
grass
and
read
and
turning
toward
servigny
she
asked
that
is
understood
at
your
service
he
replied
yvette
ran
to
get
her
hat
the
marquise
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
a
sigh
she
certainly
is
mad
she
said
then
with
an
indolence
in
her
amorous
and
lazy
gestures
she
gave
her
pretty
white
hand
to
the
baron
who
kissed
it
softly
yvette
and
servigny
started
they
went
along
the
river
crossed
the
bridge
and
went
on
to
the
island
and
then
seated
themselves
on
the
bank
beneath
the
willows
for
it
was
too
soon
to
go
to
la
grenouillere
the
young
girl
at
once
drew
a
book
from
her
pocket
and
smilingly
said
muscade
you
are
going
to
read
to
me
and
she
handed
him
the
volume
he
made
a
motion
as
if
of
fright
i
i
do
know
how
to
read
she
replied
with
gravity
come
no
excuses
no
objections
you
are
a
fine
suitor
you
all
for
nothing
is
that
it
is
that
your
motto
he
took
the
book
opened
it
and
was
astonished
it
was
a
treatise
on
entomology
a
history
of
ants
by
an
english
author
and
as
he
remained
inert
believing
that
he
was
making
sport
of
her
she
said
with
impatience
well
read
is
it
a
wager
or
just
a
simple
fad
he
asked
no
my
dear
i
saw
that
book
in
a
shop
they
told
me
that
it
was
the
best
authority
on
ants
and
i
thought
that
it
would
be
interesting
to
learn
about
the
life
of
these
little
insects
while
you
see
them
running
over
the
grass
so
read
if
you
please
she
stretched
herself
flat
upon
the
grass
her
elbows
resting
upon
the
ground
her
head
between
her
hands
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ground
he
began
to
read
as
follows
the
anthropoid
apes
are
undoubtedly
the
animals
which
approach
nearest
to
man
by
their
anatomical
structure
but
if
we
consider
the
habits
of
the
ants
their
organization
into
societies
their
vast
communities
the
houses
and
roads
that
they
construct
their
custom
of
domesticating
animals
and
sometimes
even
of
making
slaves
of
them
we
are
compelled
to
admit
that
they
have
the
right
to
claim
a
place
near
to
man
in
the
scale
of
intelligence
he
continued
in
a
monotonous
voice
stopping
from
time
to
time
to
ask
is
that
enough
she
shook
her
head
and
having
caught
an
ant
on
the
end
of
a
severed
blade
of
grass
she
amused
herself
by
making
it
go
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
sprig
which
she
tipped
up
whenever
the
insect
reached
one
of
the
ends
she
listened
with
mute
and
contented
attention
to
all
the
wonderful
details
of
the
life
of
these
frail
creatures
their
subterranean
homes
the
manner
in
which
they
seize
shut
up
and
feed
to
drink
the
sweet
milk
which
they
secrete
as
we
keep
cows
in
our
barns
their
custom
of
domesticating
little
blind
insects
which
clean
the
anthills
and
of
going
to
war
to
capture
slaves
who
will
take
care
of
their
victors
with
such
tender
solicitude
that
the
latter
even
lose
the
habit
of
feeding
themselves
and
little
by
little
as
if
a
maternal
tenderness
had
sprung
up
in
her
heart
for
the
poor
insect
which
was
so
tiny
and
so
intelligent
yvette
made
it
climb
on
her
finger
looking
at
it
with
a
moved
expression
almost
wanting
to
embrace
it
and
as
servigny
read
of
the
way
in
which
they
live
in
communities
and
play
games
of
strength
and
skill
among
themselves
the
young
girl
grew
enthusiastic
and
sought
to
kiss
the
insect
which
escaped
her
and
began
to
crawl
over
her
face
then
she
uttered
a
piercing
cry
as
if
she
had
been
threatened
by
a
terrible
danger
and
with
frantic
gestures
tried
to
brush
it
off
her
face
with
a
loud
laugh
servigny
caught
it
near
her
tresses
and
imprinted
on
the
spot
where
he
had
seized
it
a
long
kiss
without
yvette
withdrawing
her
forehead
then
she
exclaimed
as
she
rose
that
is
better
than
a
novel
now
let
us
go
to
la
grenouillere
they
reached
that
part
of
the
island
which
is
set
out
as
a
park
and
shaded
with
great
trees
couples
were
strolling
beneath
the
lofty
foliage
along
the
seine
where
the
boats
were
gliding
by
the
boats
were
filled
with
young
people
and
their
sweethearts
the
latter
in
their
with
coats
on
their
arms
tall
hats
tipped
back
and
a
jaded
look
there
were
tradesmen
with
their
families
the
women
dressed
in
their
best
and
the
children
flocking
like
little
chicks
about
their
parents
a
distant
continuous
sound
of
voices
a
heavy
scolding
clamor
announced
the
proximity
of
the
establishment
so
dear
to
the
boatmen
suddenly
they
saw
it
it
was
a
huge
boat
roofed
over
moored
to
the
bank
on
board
were
many
men
and
women
drinking
at
tables
or
else
standing
up
shouting
singing
bandying
words
dancing
capering
to
the
sound
of
a
piano
which
was
groaning
out
of
tune
and
rattling
as
an
old
kettle
two
tall
girls
with
red
lips
were
talking
coarsely
others
were
dancing
madly
with
young
fellows
half
clad
dressed
like
jockeys
in
linen
trousers
and
colored
caps
the
odors
of
a
crowd
and
of
were
noticeable
the
drinkers
around
the
tables
were
swallowing
white
red
yellow
and
green
liquids
and
vociferating
at
the
top
of
their
lungs
feeling
as
it
were
the
necessity
of
making
a
noise
a
brutal
need
of
having
their
ears
and
brains
filled
with
uproar
now
and
then
a
swimmer
standing
on
the
roof
dived
into
the
water
splashing
the
nearest
guests
who
yelled
like
savages
on
the
stream
passed
the
flotillas
of
light
craft
long
slender
wherries
swiftly
rowed
by
oarsmen
whose
muscles
played
beneath
their
bronzed
skin
the
women
in
the
boats
in
blue
or
red
flannel
skirts
with
umbrellas
red
or
blue
opened
over
their
heads
and
gleaming
under
the
burning
sun
leaned
back
in
their
chairs
at
the
stern
of
the
boats
and
seemed
almost
to
float
upon
the
water
in
motionless
and
slumberous
pose
the
heavier
boats
proceeded
slowly
crowded
with
people
a
collegian
wanting
to
show
off
rowed
like
a
windmill
against
all
the
other
boats
bringing
the
curses
of
their
oarsmen
down
upon
his
head
and
disappearing
in
dismay
after
almost
drowning
two
swimmers
followed
by
the
shouts
of
the
crowd
thronging
in
the
great
floating
cafe
yvette
radiantly
happy
taking
servigny
arm
went
into
the
midst
of
this
noisy
mob
she
seemed
to
enjoy
the
crowding
and
stared
at
the
girls
with
a
calm
and
gracious
glance
look
at
that
one
muscade
she
said
what
pretty
hair
she
has
they
seem
to
be
having
such
fun
as
the
pianist
a
boatman
dressed
in
red
with
a
huge
straw
hat
began
a
waltz
yvette
grasped
her
companion
and
they
danced
so
long
and
madly
that
everybody
looked
at
them
the
guests
standing
on
the
tables
kept
time
with
their
feet
others
threw
glasses
and
the
musician
seeming
to
go
mad
struck
the
ivory
keys
with
great
bangs
swaying
his
whole
body
and
swinging
his
head
covered
with
that
immense
hat
suddenly
he
stopped
and
slipping
to
the
deck
lay
flat
beneath
his
as
if
dead
with
fatigue
a
loud
laugh
arose
and
everybody
applauded
four
friends
rushed
forward
as
they
do
in
cases
of
accident
and
lifting
up
their
comrade
they
carried
him
by
his
four
limbs
after
carefully
placing
his
great
hat
on
his
stomach
a
joker
following
them
intoned
the
de
profundis
and
a
procession
formed
and
threaded
the
paths
of
the
island
guests
and
strollers
and
everyone
they
met
falling
into
line
yvette
darted
forward
delighted
laughing
with
her
whole
heart
chatting
with
everybody
stirred
by
the
movement
and
the
noise
the
young
men
gazed
at
her
crowded
against
her
seeming
to
devour
her
with
their
glances
and
servigny
began
to
fear
lest
the
adventure
should
terminate
badly
the
procession
still
kept
on
its
way
hastening
its
step
for
the
four
bearers
had
taken
a
quick
pace
followed
by
the
yelling
crowd
but
suddenly
they
turned
toward
the
shore
stopped
short
as
they
reached
the
bank
swung
their
comrade
for
a
moment
and
then
all
four
acting
together
flung
him
into
the
river
a
great
shout
of
joy
rang
out
from
all
mouths
while
the
poor
pianist
bewildered
paddled
swore
coughed
and
spluttered
and
though
sticking
in
the
mud
managed
to
get
to
the
shore
his
hat
which
floated
down
the
stream
was
picked
up
by
a
boat
yvette
danced
with
joy
clapping
and
repeating
oh
muscade
what
fun
what
fun
servigny
looked
on
having
become
serious
a
little
disturbed
a
little
chilled
to
see
her
so
much
at
her
ease
in
this
common
place
a
sort
of
instinct
revolted
in
him
that
instinct
of
the
proper
which
a
man
always
preserves
even
when
he
casts
himself
loose
that
instinct
which
avoids
too
common
familiarities
and
too
degrading
contacts
astonished
he
muttered
to
himself
egad
then
you
are
at
home
here
are
you
and
he
wanted
to
speak
familiarly
to
her
as
a
man
does
to
certain
women
the
first
time
he
meets
them
he
no
longer
distinguished
her
from
the
creatures
who
brushed
against
them
the
language
of
the
crowd
was
not
at
all
choice
but
nobody
seemed
shocked
or
surprised
yvette
did
not
even
appear
to
notice
it
muscade
i
want
to
go
in
bathing
she
said
we
go
into
the
river
together
at
your
service
said
he
they
went
to
the
to
get
she
was
ready
the
first
and
stood
on
the
bank
waiting
for
him
smiling
on
everyone
who
looked
at
her
then
side
by
side
they
went
into
the
water
she
swam
with
pleasure
with
intoxication
caressed
by
the
wave
throbbing
with
a
sensual
delight
raising
herself
at
each
stroke
as
if
she
were
going
to
spring
from
the
water
he
followed
her
with
difficulty
breathless
and
vexed
to
feel
himself
mediocre
at
the
sport
but
she
slackened
her
pace
and
then
turning
over
suddenly
she
floated
with
her
arms
folded
and
her
eyes
wide
open
to
the
blue
sky
he
observed
thus
stretched
out
on
the
surface
of
the
river
the
undulating
lines
of
her
form
her
firm
neck
and
shoulders
her
slightly
submerged
hips
and
bare
ankles
gleaming
in
the
water
and
the
tiny
foot
that
emerged
he
saw
her
thus
exhibiting
herself
as
if
she
were
doing
it
on
purpose
to
lure
him
on
or
again
to
make
sport
of
him
and
he
began
to
long
for
her
with
a
passionate
ardor
and
an
exasperating
impatience
suddenly
she
turned
looked
at
him
and
burst
into
laughter
you
have
a
fine
head
she
said
he
was
annoyed
at
this
bantering
possessed
with
the
anger
of
a
baffled
lover
then
yielding
brusquely
to
a
half
felt
desire
for
retaliation
a
desire
to
avenge
himself
to
wound
her
he
said
well
does
this
sort
of
life
suit
you
she
asked
with
an
artless
air
what
do
you
mean
oh
come
do
make
game
of
me
you
know
well
enough
what
i
mean
no
i
do
on
my
word
of
honor
oh
let
us
stop
this
comedy
will
you
or
will
you
not
i
do
not
understand
you
you
are
not
as
stupid
as
all
that
besides
i
told
you
last
night
told
me
what
i
have
forgotten
that
i
love
you
you
yes
what
nonsense
i
swear
it
then
prove
it
that
is
all
i
ask
what
is
to
prove
it
well
do
so
but
you
did
not
say
so
last
night
you
did
not
ask
anything
what
absurdity
and
besides
it
is
not
to
me
to
whom
you
should
make
your
proposition
to
whom
then
why
to
mamma
of
course
he
burst
into
laughter
to
your
mother
no
that
is
too
much
she
had
suddenly
become
very
grave
and
looking
him
straight
in
the
eyes
said
listen
muscade
if
you
really
love
me
enough
to
marry
me
speak
to
mamma
first
and
i
will
answer
you
afterward
he
thought
she
was
still
making
sport
of
him
and
angrily
replied
you
must
be
taking
me
for
somebody
else
she
kept
looking
at
him
with
her
soft
clear
eyes
she
hesitated
and
then
said
i
do
understand
you
at
all
then
he
answered
quickly
with
somewhat
of
ill
nature
in
his
voice
come
now
yvette
let
us
cease
this
absurd
comedy
which
has
already
lasted
too
long
you
are
playing
the
part
of
a
simple
little
girl
and
the
role
does
not
fit
you
at
all
believe
me
you
know
perfectly
well
that
there
can
be
no
question
of
marriage
between
us
but
merely
of
love
i
have
told
you
that
i
love
you
it
is
the
truth
i
repeat
i
love
you
do
pretend
any
longer
not
to
understand
me
and
do
treat
me
as
if
i
were
a
fool
they
were
face
to
face
treading
water
merely
moving
their
hands
a
little
to
steady
themselves
she
was
still
for
a
moment
as
if
she
could
not
make
out
the
meaning
of
his
words
then
she
suddenly
blushed
up
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
her
whole
face
grew
purple
from
her
neck
to
her
ears
which
became
almost
violet
and
without
answering
a
word
she
fled
toward
the
shore
swimming
with
all
her
strength
with
hasty
strokes
he
could
not
keep
up
with
her
and
panted
with
fatigue
as
he
followed
he
saw
her
leave
the
water
pick
up
her
cloak
and
go
to
her
without
looking
back
it
took
him
a
long
time
to
dress
very
much
perplexed
as
to
what
he
ought
to
do
puzzled
over
what
he
should
say
to
her
and
wondering
whether
he
ought
to
excuse
himself
or
persevere
when
he
was
ready
she
had
gone
away
all
alone
he
went
back
slowly
anxious
and
disturbed
the
marquise
was
strolling
on
saval
arm
in
the
circular
path
around
the
lawn
as
she
observed
servigny
she
said
with
that
careless
air
which
she
had
maintained
since
the
night
before
i
told
you
not
to
go
out
in
such
hot
weather
and
now
yvette
has
come
back
almost
with
a
sun
stroke
she
has
gone
to
lie
down
she
was
as
red
as
a
poppy
the
poor
child
and
she
has
a
frightful
headache
you
must
have
been
walking
in
the
full
sunlight
or
you
must
have
done
something
foolish
you
are
as
unreasonable
as
she
the
young
girl
did
not
come
down
to
dinner
when
they
wanted
to
send
her
up
something
to
eat
she
called
through
the
door
that
she
was
not
hungry
for
she
had
shut
herself
in
and
she
begged
that
they
would
leave
her
undisturbed
the
two
young
men
left
by
the
ten
train
promising
to
return
the
following
thursday
and
the
marquise
seated
herself
at
the
open
window
to
dream
hearing
in
the
distance
the
orchestra
of
the
boatmen
ball
with
its
sprightly
music
in
the
deep
and
solemn
silence
of
the
night
swayed
by
love
as
a
person
is
moved
by
a
fondness
for
horses
or
boating
she
was
subject
to
sudden
tendernesses
which
crept
over
her
like
a
disease
these
passions
took
possession
of
her
suddenly
penetrated
her
entire
being
maddened
her
enervated
or
overwhelmed
her
in
measure
as
they
were
of
an
exalted
violent
dramatic
or
sentimental
character
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
are
created
to
love
and
to
be
loved
starting
from
a
very
low
station
in
life
she
had
risen
in
her
adventurous
career
acting
instinctively
with
inborn
cleverness
accepting
money
and
kisses
naturally
without
distinguishing
between
them
employing
her
extraordinary
ability
in
an
unthinking
and
simple
fashion
from
all
her
experiences
she
had
never
known
either
a
genuine
tenderness
or
a
great
repulsion
she
had
had
various
friends
for
she
had
to
live
as
in
traveling
a
person
eats
at
many
tables
but
occasionally
her
heart
took
fire
and
she
really
fell
in
love
which
state
lasted
for
some
weeks
or
months
according
to
conditions
these
were
the
delicious
moments
of
her
life
for
she
loved
with
all
her
soul
she
cast
herself
upon
love
as
a
person
throws
himself
into
the
river
to
drown
himself
and
let
herself
be
carried
away
ready
to
die
if
need
be
intoxicated
maddened
infinitely
happy
she
imagined
each
time
that
she
never
had
experienced
anything
like
such
an
attachment
and
she
would
have
been
greatly
astonished
if
some
one
had
told
her
of
how
many
men
she
had
dreamed
whole
nights
through
looking
at
the
stars
saval
had
captivated
her
body
and
soul
she
dreamed
of
him
lulled
by
his
face
and
his
memory
in
the
calm
exaltation
of
consummated
love
of
present
and
certain
happiness
a
sound
behind
her
made
her
turn
around
yvette
had
just
entered
still
in
her
daytime
dress
but
pale
with
eyes
glittering
as
sometimes
is
the
case
after
some
great
fatigue
she
leaned
on
the
sill
of
the
open
window
facing
her
mother
i
want
to
speak
to
you
she
said
the
marquise
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
she
loved
her
like
an
egotistical
mother
proud
of
her
beauty
as
a
person
is
proud
of
a
fortune
too
pretty
still
herself
to
become
jealous
too
indifferent
to
plan
the
schemes
with
which
they
charged
her
too
clever
nevertheless
not
to
have
full
consciousness
of
her
value
i
am
listening
my
child
she
said
what
is
it
yvette
gave
her
a
piercing
look
as
if
to
read
the
depths
of
her
soul
and
to
seize
all
the
sensations
which
her
words
might
awake
it
is
this
something
strange
has
just
happened
what
can
it
be
monsieur
de
servigny
has
told
me
that
he
loves
me
the
marquise
disturbed
waited
a
moment
and
as
yvette
said
nothing
more
she
asked
how
did
he
tell
you
that
explain
yourself
then
the
young
girl
sitting
at
her
mother
feet
in
a
coaxing
attitude
common
with
her
and
clasping
her
hands
added
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
madame
obardi
made
a
sudden
gesture
of
stupefaction
and
cried
servigny
why
you
are
crazy
yvette
had
not
taken
her
eyes
off
her
mother
face
watching
her
thoughts
and
her
surprise
she
asked
with
a
serious
voice
why
am
i
crazy
why
should
not
monsieur
de
servigny
marry
me
the
marquise
embarrassed
stammered
you
are
mistaken
it
is
not
possible
you
either
did
not
hear
or
did
not
understand
monsieur
de
servigny
is
too
rich
for
you
and
too
much
of
a
parisian
to
marry
yvette
rose
softly
she
added
but
if
he
loves
me
as
he
says
he
does
mamma
her
mother
replied
with
some
impatience
i
thought
you
big
enough
and
wise
enough
not
to
have
such
ideas
servigny
is
a
and
an
egotist
he
will
never
marry
anyone
but
a
woman
of
his
set
and
his
fortune
if
he
asked
you
in
marriage
it
is
only
that
he
wants
the
marquise
incapable
of
expressing
her
meaning
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
continued
come
now
leave
me
alone
and
go
to
bed
and
the
young
girl
as
if
she
had
learned
what
she
sought
to
find
out
answered
in
a
docile
voice
yes
mamma
she
kissed
her
mother
on
the
forehead
and
withdrew
with
a
calm
step
as
she
reached
the
door
the
marquise
called
out
and
your
sunstroke
she
said
i
did
not
have
one
at
all
it
was
that
which
caused
everything
the
marquise
added
we
will
not
speak
of
it
again
only
do
stay
alone
with
him
for
some
time
from
now
and
be
very
sure
that
he
will
never
marry
you
do
you
understand
and
that
he
merely
means
to
compromise
you
she
could
not
find
better
words
to
express
her
thought
yvette
went
to
her
room
madame
obardi
began
to
dream
living
for
years
in
an
opulent
and
loving
repose
she
had
carefully
put
aside
all
reflections
which
might
annoy
or
sadden
her
never
had
she
been
willing
to
ask
herself
the
what
would
become
of
yvette
it
would
be
soon
enough
to
think
about
the
difficulties
when
they
arrived
she
well
knew
from
her
experience
that
her
daughter
could
not
marry
a
man
who
was
rich
and
of
good
society
excepting
by
a
totally
improbable
chance
by
one
of
those
surprises
of
love
which
place
adventuresses
on
thrones
she
had
not
considered
it
furthermore
being
too
much
occupied
with
herself
to
make
any
plans
which
did
not
directly
concern
herself
yvette
would
do
as
her
mother
undoubtedly
she
would
lead
a
gay
life
why
not
but
the
marquise
had
never
dared
ask
when
or
how
that
would
all
come
about
in
time
and
now
her
daughter
all
of
a
sudden
without
warning
had
asked
one
of
those
questions
which
could
not
be
answered
forcing
her
to
take
an
attitude
in
an
affair
so
delicate
so
dangerous
in
every
respect
and
so
disturbing
to
the
conscience
which
a
woman
is
expected
to
show
in
matters
concerning
her
daughter
sometimes
nodding
but
never
asleep
she
had
too
much
natural
astuteness
to
be
deceived
a
minute
about
servigny
intentions
for
she
knew
men
by
experience
and
especially
men
of
that
set
so
at
the
first
words
uttered
by
yvette
she
had
cried
almost
in
spite
of
herself
servigny
marry
you
you
are
crazy
how
had
he
come
to
employ
that
old
method
he
that
sharp
man
of
the
world
what
would
he
do
now
and
she
the
young
girl
how
should
she
warn
her
more
clearly
and
even
forbid
her
for
she
might
make
great
mistakes
would
anyone
have
believed
that
this
big
girl
had
remained
so
artless
so
ill
informed
so
guileless
and
the
marquise
greatly
perplexed
and
already
wearied
with
her
reflections
endeavored
to
make
up
her
mind
what
to
do
without
finding
a
solution
of
the
problem
for
the
situation
seemed
to
her
very
embarrassing
worn
out
with
this
worry
she
thought
i
will
watch
them
more
clearly
i
will
act
according
to
circumstances
if
necessary
i
will
speak
to
servigny
who
is
sharp
and
will
take
a
hint
she
did
not
think
out
what
she
should
say
to
him
nor
what
he
would
answer
nor
what
sort
of
an
understanding
could
be
established
between
them
but
happy
at
being
relieved
of
this
care
without
having
had
to
make
a
decision
she
resumed
her
dreams
of
the
handsome
saval
and
turning
toward
that
misty
light
which
hovers
over
paris
she
threw
kisses
with
both
hands
toward
the
great
city
rapid
kisses
which
she
tossed
into
the
darkness
one
after
the
other
without
counting
and
very
low
as
if
she
were
talking
to
saval
still
she
murmured
i
love
you
i
love
you

yvette
also
could
not
sleep
like
her
mother
she
leaned
upon
the
sill
of
the
open
window
and
tears
her
first
bitter
tears
filled
her
eyes
up
to
this
time
she
had
lived
had
grown
up
in
the
heedless
and
serene
confidence
of
happy
youth
why
should
she
have
dreamed
reflected
puzzled
why
should
she
not
have
been
a
young
girl
like
all
other
young
girls
why
should
a
doubt
a
fear
or
painful
suspicion
have
come
to
her
she
seemed
posted
on
all
topics
because
she
had
a
way
of
talking
on
all
subjects
because
she
had
taken
the
tone
demeanor
and
words
of
the
people
who
lived
around
her
but
she
really
knew
no
more
than
a
little
girl
raised
in
a
convent
her
audacities
of
speech
came
from
her
memory
from
that
unconscious
faculty
of
imitation
and
assimilation
which
women
possess
and
not
from
a
mind
instructed
and
emboldened
she
spoke
of
love
as
the
son
of
a
painter
or
a
musician
would
at
the
age
of
ten
or
twelve
years
speak
of
painting
or
music
she
knew
or
rather
suspected
very
well
what
sort
of
mystery
this
word
concealed
too
many
jokes
had
been
whispered
before
her
for
her
innocence
not
to
be
a
trifle
enlightened
but
how
could
she
have
drawn
the
conclusion
from
all
this
that
all
families
did
not
resemble
hers
they
kissed
her
mother
hand
with
the
semblance
of
respect
all
their
friends
had
titles
they
all
were
rich
or
seemed
to
be
so
they
all
spoke
familiarly
of
the
princes
of
the
royal
line
two
sons
of
kings
had
even
come
often
in
the
evening
to
the
house
how
should
she
have
known
and
then
she
was
naturally
artless
she
did
not
estimate
or
sum
up
people
as
her
mother
did
she
lived
tranquilly
too
joyous
in
her
life
to
worry
herself
about
what
might
appear
suspicious
to
creatures
more
calm
thoughtful
reserved
less
cordial
and
sunny
but
now
all
at
once
servigny
by
a
few
words
the
brutality
of
which
she
felt
without
understanding
them
awakened
in
her
a
sudden
disquietude
unreasoning
at
first
but
which
grew
into
a
tormenting
apprehension
she
had
fled
home
had
escaped
like
a
wounded
animal
wounded
in
fact
most
deeply
by
those
words
which
she
ceaselessly
repeated
to
get
all
their
sense
and
bearing
you
know
very
well
that
there
can
be
no
question
of
marriage
between
us
but
only
of
love
what
did
he
mean
and
why
this
insult
was
she
then
in
ignorance
of
something
some
secret
some
shame
she
was
the
only
one
ignorant
of
it
no
doubt
but
what
could
she
do
she
was
frightened
startled
as
a
person
is
when
he
discovers
some
hidden
infamy
some
treason
of
a
beloved
friend
one
of
those
which
crush
she
dreamed
reflected
puzzled
wept
consumed
by
fears
and
suspicions
then
her
joyous
young
soul
reassuring
itself
she
began
to
plan
an
adventure
to
imagine
an
abnormal
and
dramatic
situation
founded
on
the
recollections
of
all
the
poetical
romances
she
had
read
she
recalled
all
the
moving
catastrophes
or
sad
and
touching
stories
she
jumbled
them
together
and
concocted
a
story
of
her
own
with
which
she
interpreted
the
mystery
which
enveloped
her
life
she
was
no
longer
cast
down
she
dreamed
she
lifted
veils
she
imagined
unlikely
complications
a
thousand
singular
terrible
things
seductive
nevertheless
by
their
very
strangeness
could
she
be
by
chance
the
natural
daughter
of
a
prince
had
her
poor
mother
betrayed
and
deserted
made
marquise
by
some
king
perhaps
king
victor
emmanuel
been
obliged
to
take
flight
before
the
anger
of
the
family
was
she
not
rather
a
child
abandoned
by
its
relations
who
were
noble
and
illustrious
the
fruit
of
a
clandestine
love
taken
in
by
the
marquise
who
had
adopted
and
brought
her
up
still
other
suppositions
passed
through
her
mind
she
accepted
or
rejected
them
according
to
the
dictates
of
her
fancy
she
was
moved
to
pity
over
her
own
case
happy
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
and
sad
also
taking
a
sort
of
satisfaction
in
becoming
a
sort
of
a
heroine
of
a
book
who
must
assume
a
noble
attitude
worthy
of
herself
she
laid
out
the
part
she
must
play
according
to
events
at
which
she
guessed
she
vaguely
outlined
this
role
like
one
of
scribe
or
of
george
sand
it
should
be
endued
with
devotion
greatness
of
soul
tenderness
and
fine
words
her
pliant
nature
almost
rejoiced
in
this
new
attitude
she
pondered
almost
till
evening
what
she
should
do
wondering
how
she
should
manage
to
wrest
the
truth
from
the
marquise
and
when
night
came
favorable
to
tragic
situations
she
had
thought
out
a
simple
and
subtile
trick
to
obtain
what
she
wanted
it
was
brusquely
to
say
that
servigny
had
asked
for
her
hand
in
marriage
at
this
news
madame
obardi
taken
by
surprise
would
certainly
let
a
word
escape
her
lips
a
cry
which
would
throw
light
into
the
mind
of
her
daughter
and
yvette
had
accomplished
her
plan
she
expected
an
explosion
of
astonishment
an
expansion
of
love
a
confidence
full
of
gestures
and
tears
but
instead
of
this
her
mother
without
appearing
stupefied
or
grieved
had
only
seemed
bored
and
from
the
constrained
discontented
and
worried
tone
in
which
she
had
replied
the
young
girl
in
whom
there
suddenly
awaked
all
the
astuteness
keenness
and
sharpness
of
a
woman
understanding
that
she
must
not
insist
that
the
mystery
was
of
another
nature
that
it
would
be
painful
to
her
to
learn
it
and
that
she
must
puzzle
it
out
all
alone
had
gone
back
to
her
room
her
heart
oppressed
her
soul
in
distress
possessed
now
with
the
apprehensions
of
a
real
misfortune
without
knowing
exactly
either
whence
or
why
this
emotion
came
to
her
so
she
wept
leaning
at
the
window
she
wept
long
not
dreaming
of
anything
now
not
seeking
to
discover
anything
more
and
little
by
little
weariness
overcoming
her
she
closed
her
eyes
she
dozed
for
a
few
minutes
with
that
deep
sleep
of
people
who
are
tired
out
and
have
not
the
energy
to
undress
and
go
to
bed
that
heavy
sleep
broken
by
dreams
when
the
head
nods
upon
the
breast
she
did
not
go
to
bed
until
the
first
break
of
day
when
the
cold
of
the
morning
chilling
her
compelled
her
to
leave
the
window
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
she
maintained
a
reserved
and
melancholy
attitude
her
thoughts
were
busy
she
was
learning
to
spy
out
to
guess
at
conclusions
to
reason
a
light
still
vague
seemed
to
illumine
men
and
things
around
her
in
a
new
manner
she
began
to
entertain
suspicions
against
all
against
everything
that
she
had
believed
against
her
mother
she
imagined
all
sorts
of
things
during
these
two
days
she
considered
all
the
possibilities
taking
the
most
extreme
resolutions
with
the
suddenness
of
her
changeable
and
unrestrained
nature
wednesday
she
hit
upon
a
plan
an
entire
schedule
of
conduct
and
a
system
of
spying
she
rose
thursday
morning
with
the
resolve
to
be
very
sharp
and
armed
against
everybody
she
determined
even
to
take
for
her
motto
these
two
words
myself
alone
and
she
pondered
for
more
than
an
hour
how
she
should
arrange
them
to
produce
a
good
effect
engraved
about
her
crest
on
her
writing
paper
saval
and
servigny
arrived
at
ten
the
young
girl
gave
her
hand
with
reserve
without
embarrassment
and
in
a
tone
familiar
though
grave
she
said
good
morning
muscade
are
you
well
good
morning
fairly
thanks
and
you
he
was
watching
her
what
comedy
will
she
play
me
he
said
to
himself
the
marquise
having
taken
saval
arm
he
took
yvette
and
they
began
to
stroll
about
the
lawn
appearing
and
disappearing
every
minute
behind
the
clumps
of
trees
yvette
walked
with
a
thoughtful
air
looking
at
the
gravel
of
the
pathway
appearing
hardly
to
hear
what
her
companion
said
and
scarcely
answering
him
suddenly
she
asked
are
you
truly
my
friend
muscade
why
of
course
but
truly
truly
now
absolutely
your
friend
body
and
soul
even
enough
of
a
friend
not
to
lie
to
me
once
just
once
even
twice
if
necessary
even
enough
to
tell
me
the
absolute
exact
truth
yes
well
what
do
you
think
way
down
in
your
heart
of
the
prince
of
kravalow
ah
the
devil
you
see
that
you
are
already
preparing
to
lie
not
at
all
but
i
am
seeking
the
words
the
proper
words
great
heavens
prince
kravalow
is
a
russian
who
speaks
russian
who
was
born
in
russia
who
has
perhaps
had
a
passport
to
come
to
france
and
about
whom
there
is
nothing
false
but
his
name
and
title
she
looked
him
in
the
eyes
you
mean
that
he
is
an
adventurer
thank
you
and
chevalier
valreali
is
no
better
you
have
hit
it
and
monsieur
de
belvigne
with
him
it
is
a
different
thing
he
is
of
provincial
society
honorable
up
to
a
certain
point
but
only
a
little
scorched
from
having
lived
too
rapidly
and
you
i
am
what
they
call
a
butterfly
a
man
of
good
family
who
had
intelligence
and
who
has
squandered
it
in
making
phrases
who
had
good
health
and
who
has
injured
it
by
dissipation
who
had
some
worth
perhaps
and
who
has
scattered
it
by
doing
nothing
there
is
left
to
me
a
certain
knowledge
of
life
a
complete
absence
of
prejudice
a
large
contempt
for
mankind
including
women
a
very
deep
sentiment
of
the
uselessness
of
my
acts
and
a
vast
tolerance
for
the
mob
nevertheless
at
times
i
can
be
frank
and
i
am
even
capable
of
affection
as
you
could
see
if
you
would
with
these
defects
and
qualities
i
place
myself
at
your
orders
morally
and
physically
to
do
what
you
please
with
me
she
did
not
laugh
she
listened
weighing
his
words
and
his
intentions
then
she
resumed
what
do
you
think
of
the
countess
de
lammy
he
replied
vivaciously
you
will
permit
me
not
to
give
my
opinion
about
the
women
about
none
of
them
about
none
of
them
then
you
must
have
a
bad
opinion
of
them
all
come
think
wo
you
make
a
single
exception
he
sneered
with
that
insolent
air
which
he
generally
wore
and
with
that
brutal
audacity
which
he
used
as
a
weapon
he
said
present
company
is
always
excepted
she
blushed
a
little
but
calmly
asked
well
what
do
you
think
of
me
you
want
me
to
tell
well
so
be
it
i
think
you
are
a
young
person
of
good
sense
and
practicalness
or
if
you
prefer
of
good
practical
sense
who
knows
very
well
how
to
arrange
her
pastime
to
amuse
people
to
hide
her
views
to
lay
her
snares
and
who
without
hurrying
awaits
events
is
that
all
she
asked
that
all
then
she
said
with
a
serious
earnestness
i
shall
make
you
change
that
opinion
muscade
then
she
joined
her
mother
who
was
proceeding
with
short
steps
her
head
down
with
that
manner
assumed
in
talking
very
low
while
walking
of
very
intimate
and
very
sweet
things
as
she
advanced
she
drew
shapes
in
the
sand
letters
perhaps
with
the
point
of
her
sunshade
and
she
spoke
without
looking
at
saval
long
softly
leaning
on
his
arm
pressed
against
him
yvette
suddenly
fixed
her
eyes
upon
her
and
a
suspicion
rather
a
feeling
than
a
doubt
passed
through
her
mind
as
a
shadow
of
a
cloud
driven
by
the
wind
passes
over
the
ground
the
bell
rang
for
breakfast
it
was
silent
and
almost
gloomy
there
was
a
storm
in
the
air
great
solid
clouds
rested
upon
the
horizon
mute
and
heavy
but
charged
with
a
tempest
as
soon
as
they
had
taken
their
coffee
on
the
terrace
the
marquise
asked
well
darling
are
you
going
to
take
a
walk
today
with
your
friend
servigny
it
is
a
good
time
to
enjoy
the
coolness
under
the
trees
yvette
gave
her
a
quick
glance
no
mamma
i
am
not
going
out
the
marquise
appeared
annoyed
and
insisted
oh
go
and
take
a
stroll
my
child
it
is
excellent
for
you
then
yvette
distinctly
said
no
mamma
i
shall
stay
in
the
house
and
you
know
very
well
why
because
i
told
you
the
other
evening
madame
obardi
gave
it
no
further
thought
preoccupied
with
the
thought
of
remaining
alone
with
saval
she
blushed
and
was
annoyed
disturbed
on
her
own
account
not
knowing
how
she
could
find
a
free
hour
or
two
she
stammered
it
is
true
i
was
not
thinking
of
it
i
do
know
where
my
head
is
and
yvette
taking
up
some
embroidery
which
she
called
the
public
safety
and
at
which
she
worked
five
or
six
times
a
year
on
dull
days
seated
herself
on
a
low
chair
near
her
mother
while
the
two
young
men
astride
smoked
their
cigars
the
hours
passed
in
a
languid
conversation
the
marquise
fidgety
cast
longing
glances
at
saval
seeking
some
pretext
some
means
of
getting
rid
of
her
daughter
she
finally
realized
that
she
would
not
succeed
and
not
knowing
what
ruse
to
employ
she
said
to
servigny
you
know
my
dear
duke
that
i
am
going
to
keep
you
both
this
evening
we
shall
breakfast
at
the
fournaise
restaurant
at
chaton
he
understood
smiled
and
bowed
i
am
at
your
orders
marquise
the
day
wore
on
slowly
and
painfully
under
the
threatenings
of
the
storm
the
hour
for
dinner
gradually
approached
the
heavy
sky
was
filled
with
slow
and
heavy
clouds
there
was
not
a
breath
of
air
stirring
the
evening
meal
was
silent
too
an
oppression
an
embarrassment
a
sort
of
vague
fear
seemed
to
make
the
two
men
and
the
two
women
mute
when
the
covers
were
removed
they
sat
long
upon
the
terrace
only
speaking
at
long
intervals
night
fell
a
sultry
night
suddenly
the
horizon
was
torn
by
an
immense
flash
of
lightning
which
illumined
with
a
dazzling
and
wan
light
the
four
faces
shrouded
in
darkness
then
a
sound
heavy
and
feeble
like
the
rumbling
of
a
carriage
upon
a
bridge
passed
over
the
earth
and
it
seemed
that
the
heat
of
the
atmosphere
increased
that
the
air
suddenly
became
more
oppressive
and
the
silence
of
the
evening
deeper
yvette
rose
i
am
going
to
bed
she
said
the
storm
makes
me
and
she
offered
her
brow
to
the
marquise
gave
her
hand
to
the
two
young
men
and
withdrew
as
her
room
was
just
above
the
terrace
the
leaves
of
a
great
growing
before
the
door
soon
gleamed
with
a
green
hue
and
servigny
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
this
pale
light
in
the
foliage
in
which
at
times
he
thought
he
saw
a
shadow
pass
but
suddenly
the
light
went
out
madame
obardi
gave
a
great
sigh
my
daughter
has
gone
to
bed
she
said
servigny
rose
saying
i
am
going
to
do
as
much
marquise
if
you
will
permit
me
he
kissed
the
hand
she
held
out
to
him
and
disappeared
in
turn
she
was
left
alone
with
saval
in
the
night
in
a
moment
she
was
clasped
in
his
arms
then
although
he
tried
to
prevent
her
she
kneeled
before
him
murmuring
i
want
to
see
you
by
the
lightning
flashes
but
yvette
her
candle
snuffed
out
had
returned
to
her
balcony
barefoot
gliding
like
a
shadow
and
she
listened
consumed
by
an
unhappy
and
confused
suspicion
she
could
not
see
as
she
was
above
them
on
the
roof
of
the
terrace
she
heard
nothing
but
a
murmur
of
voices
and
her
heart
beat
so
fast
that
she
could
actually
hear
its
throbbing
a
window
closed
on
the
floor
above
her
servigny
then
must
have
just
gone
up
to
his
room
her
mother
was
alone
with
the
other
man
a
second
flash
of
lightning
clearing
the
sky
lighted
up
for
a
second
all
the
landscape
she
knew
so
well
with
a
startling
and
sinister
gleam
and
she
saw
the
great
river
with
the
color
of
melted
lead
as
a
river
appears
in
dreams
in
fantastic
scenes
just
then
a
voice
below
her
uttered
the
words
i
love
you
and
she
heard
nothing
more
a
strange
shudder
passed
over
her
body
and
her
soul
shivered
in
frightful
distress
a
heavy
infinite
silence
which
seemed
eternal
hung
over
the
world
she
could
no
longer
breathe
her
breast
oppressed
by
something
unknown
and
horrible
another
flash
of
lightning
illumined
space
lighting
up
the
horizon
for
an
instant
then
another
almost
immediately
came
followed
by
still
others
and
the
voice
which
she
had
already
heard
repeated
more
loudly
oh
how
i
love
you
how
i
love
you
and
yvette
recognized
the
voice
it
was
her
mother
a
large
drop
of
warm
rain
fell
upon
her
brow
and
a
slight
and
almost
imperceptible
motion
ran
through
the
leaves
the
quivering
of
the
rain
which
was
now
beginning
then
a
noise
came
from
afar
a
confused
sound
like
that
of
the
wind
in
the
branches
it
was
the
deluge
descending
in
sheets
on
earth
and
river
and
trees
in
a
few
minutes
the
water
poured
about
her
covering
her
drenching
her
like
a
she
did
not
move
thinking
only
of
what
was
happening
on
the
terrace
she
heard
them
get
up
and
go
to
their
rooms
doors
were
closed
within
the
house
and
the
young
girl
yielding
to
an
irresistible
desire
to
learn
what
was
going
on
a
desire
which
maddened
and
tortured
her
glided
downstairs
softly
opened
the
outer
door
and
crossing
the
lawn
under
the
furious
downpour
ran
and
hid
in
a
clump
of
trees
to
look
at
the
windows
only
one
window
was
lighted
her
mother
and
suddenly
two
shadows
appeared
in
the
luminous
square
two
shadows
side
by
side
then
distracted
without
reflection
without
knowing
what
she
was
doing
she
screamed
with
all
her
might
in
a
shrill
voice
mamma
as
a
person
would
cry
out
to
warn
people
in
danger
of
death
her
desperate
cry
was
lost
in
the
noise
of
the
rain
but
the
couple
separated
disturbed
and
one
of
the
shadows
disappeared
while
the
other
tried
to
discover
something
peering
through
the
darkness
of
the
garden
fearing
to
be
surprised
or
to
meet
her
mother
at
that
moment
yvette
rushed
back
to
the
house
ran
upstairs
dripping
wet
and
shut
herself
in
her
room
resolved
to
open
her
door
to
no
one
without
taking
off
her
streaming
dress
which
clung
to
her
form
she
fell
on
her
knees
with
clasped
hands
in
her
distress
imploring
some
superhuman
protection
the
mysterious
aid
of
heaven
the
unknown
support
which
a
person
seeks
in
hours
of
tears
and
despair
the
great
lightning
flashes
threw
for
an
instant
their
livid
reflections
into
her
room
and
she
saw
herself
in
the
mirror
of
her
wardrobe
with
her
wet
and
disheveled
hair
looking
so
strange
that
she
did
not
recognize
herself
she
remained
there
so
long
that
the
storm
abated
without
her
perceiving
it
the
rain
ceased
a
light
filled
the
sky
still
obscured
with
clouds
and
a
mild
balmy
delicious
freshness
a
freshness
of
grass
and
wet
leaves
came
in
through
the
open
window
yvette
rose
took
off
her
wet
cold
garments
without
thinking
what
she
was
doing
and
went
to
bed
she
stared
with
fixed
eyes
at
the
dawning
day
then
she
wept
again
and
then
she
began
to
think
her
mother
a
lover
what
a
shame
she
had
read
so
many
books
in
which
women
even
mothers
had
overstepped
the
bounds
of
propriety
to
regain
their
honor
at
the
pages
of
the
climax
that
she
was
not
astonished
beyond
measure
at
finding
herself
enveloped
in
a
drama
similar
to
all
those
of
her
reading
the
violence
of
her
first
grief
the
cruel
shock
of
surprise
had
already
worn
off
a
little
in
the
confused
remembrance
of
analogous
situations
her
mind
had
rambled
among
such
tragic
adventures
painted
by
the
that
the
horrible
discovery
seemed
little
by
little
like
the
natural
continuation
of
some
serial
story
begun
the
evening
before
she
said
to
herself
i
will
save
my
mother
and
almost
reassured
by
this
heroic
resolution
she
felt
herself
strengthened
ready
at
once
for
the
devotion
and
the
struggle
she
reflected
on
the
means
which
must
be
employed
a
single
one
seemed
good
which
was
quite
in
keeping
with
her
romantic
nature
and
she
rehearsed
the
interview
which
she
should
have
with
the
marquise
as
an
actor
rehearses
the
scene
which
he
is
going
to
play
the
sun
had
risen
the
servants
were
stirring
about
the
house
the
chambermaid
came
with
the
chocolate
yvette
put
the
tray
on
the
table
and
said
you
will
say
to
my
mother
that
i
am
not
well
that
i
am
going
to
stay
in
bed
until
those
gentlemen
leave
that
i
could
not
sleep
last
night
and
that
i
do
not
want
to
be
disturbed
because
i
am
going
to
try
to
rest
the
servant
surprised
looked
at
the
wet
dress
which
had
fallen
like
a
rag
on
the
carpet
so
mademoiselle
has
been
out
she
said
yes
i
went
out
for
a
walk
in
the
rain
to
refresh
myself
the
maid
picked
up
the
skirts
stockings
and
wet
shoes
then
she
went
away
carrying
on
her
arm
with
fastidious
precautions
these
garments
soaked
as
the
clothes
of
a
drowned
person
and
yvette
waited
well
knowing
that
her
mother
would
come
to
her
the
marquise
entered
having
jumped
from
her
bed
at
the
first
words
of
the
chambermaid
for
a
suspicion
had
possessed
her
heart
since
that
cry
mamma
heard
in
the
dark
what
is
the
matter
she
said
yvette
looked
at
her
and
stammered
i
i
then
overpowered
by
a
sudden
and
terrible
emotion
she
began
to
choke
the
marquise
astonished
again
asked
what
in
the
world
is
the
matter
with
you
then
forgetting
all
her
plans
and
prepared
phrases
the
young
girl
hid
her
face
in
both
hands
and
stammered
oh
mamma
oh
mamma
madame
obardi
stood
by
the
bed
too
much
affected
thoroughly
to
understand
but
guessing
almost
everything
with
that
subtile
instinct
whence
she
derived
her
strength
as
yvette
could
not
speak
choked
with
tears
her
mother
worn
out
finally
and
feeling
some
fearful
explanation
coming
brusquely
asked
come
will
you
tell
me
what
the
matter
is
yvette
could
hardly
utter
the
words
oh
last
night
i
saw
your
window
the
marquise
very
pale
said
well
what
of
it
her
daughter
repeated
still
sobbing
oh
mamma
oh
mamma
madame
obardi
whose
fear
and
embarrassment
turned
to
anger
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
turned
to
go
i
really
believe
that
you
are
crazy
when
this
ends
you
will
let
me
know
but
the
young
girl
suddenly
took
her
hands
from
her
face
which
was
streaming
with
tears
no
listen
i
must
speak
to
you
listen
you
must
promise
me
we
must
both
go
away
very
far
off
into
the
country
and
we
must
live
like
the
country
people
and
no
one
must
know
what
has
become
of
us
say
you
will
mamma
i
beg
you
i
implore
you
will
you
the
marquise
confused
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
she
had
in
her
veins
the
irascible
blood
of
the
common
people
then
a
sense
of
shame
a
mother
modesty
mingled
with
a
vague
sentiment
of
fear
and
the
exasperation
of
a
passionate
woman
whose
love
is
threatened
and
she
shuddered
ready
to
ask
for
pardon
or
to
yield
to
some
violence
i
do
understand
you
she
said
yvette
replied
i
saw
you
mamma
last
night
you
can
not
if
you
knew
we
will
both
go
away
i
will
love
you
so
much
that
you
will
forget
madame
obardi
said
in
a
trembling
voice
listen
my
daughter
there
are
some
things
which
you
do
not
yet
understand
well
forget
do
i
forbid
you
ever
to
speak
to
me
about
those
things
but
the
young
girl
brusquely
taking
the
role
of
savior
which
she
had
imposed
upon
herself
rejoined
no
mamma
i
am
no
longer
a
child
and
i
have
the
right
to
know
i
know
that
we
receive
persons
of
bad
repute
adventurers
and
i
know
that
on
that
account
people
do
not
respect
us
i
know
more
well
it
must
not
be
any
longer
do
you
hear
i
do
not
wish
it
we
will
go
away
you
will
sell
your
jewels
we
will
work
if
need
be
and
we
will
live
as
honest
women
somewhere
very
far
away
and
if
i
can
marry
so
much
the
better
she
answered
you
are
crazy
you
will
do
me
the
favor
to
rise
and
come
down
to
breakfast
with
all
the
rest
no
mamma
there
is
some
one
whom
i
shall
never
see
again
you
understand
me
i
want
him
to
leave
or
i
shall
leave
you
shall
choose
between
him
and
me
she
was
sitting
up
in
bed
and
she
raised
her
voice
speaking
as
they
do
on
the
stage
playing
finally
the
drama
which
she
had
dreamed
almost
forgetting
her
grief
in
the
effort
to
fulfill
her
mission
the
marquise
stupefied
again
repeated
you
are
crazy
not
finding
anything
else
to
say
yvette
replied
with
a
theatrical
energy
no
mamma
that
man
shall
leave
the
house
or
i
shall
go
myself
for
i
will
not
weaken
and
where
will
you
go
what
will
you
do
i
do
not
know
it
matters
little
i
want
you
to
be
an
honest
woman
these
words
which
recurred
aroused
in
the
marquise
a
perfect
fury
and
she
cried
be
silent
i
do
not
permit
you
to
talk
to
me
like
that
i
am
as
good
as
anybody
else
do
you
understand
i
lead
a
certain
sort
of
life
it
is
true
and
i
am
proud
of
it
the
women
are
not
as
good
as
i
am
yvette
astonished
looked
at
her
and
stammered
oh
mamma
but
the
marquise
carried
away
with
excitement
continued
yes
i
lead
a
certain
life
what
of
it
otherwise
you
would
be
a
cook
as
i
was
once
and
earn
thirty
sous
a
day
you
would
be
washing
dishes
and
your
mistress
would
send
you
to
market
do
you
understand
and
she
would
turn
you
out
if
you
loitered
just
as
you
loiter
now
because
i
am
because
i
lead
this
life
listen
when
a
person
is
only
a
nursemaid
a
poor
girl
with
fifty
francs
saved
up
she
must
know
how
to
manage
if
she
does
not
want
to
starve
to
death
and
there
are
not
two
ways
for
us
there
are
not
two
ways
do
you
understand
when
we
are
servants
we
can
not
make
our
fortune
with
official
positions
nor
with
stockjobbing
tricks
we
have
only
one
way
only
one
way
she
struck
her
breast
as
a
penitent
at
the
confessional
and
flushed
and
excited
coming
toward
the
bed
she
continued
so
much
the
worse
a
pretty
girl
must
live
or
suffer
she
has
no
choice
then
returning
to
her
former
idea
much
they
deny
themselves
your
women
they
are
worse
because
nothing
compels
them
they
have
money
to
live
on
and
amuse
themselves
and
they
choose
vicious
lives
of
their
own
accord
they
are
the
bad
ones
in
reality
she
was
standing
near
the
bed
of
the
distracted
yvette
who
wanted
to
cry
out
help
to
escape
yvette
wept
aloud
like
children
who
are
whipped
the
marquise
was
silent
and
looked
at
her
daughter
and
seeing
her
overwhelmed
with
despair
felt
herself
the
pangs
of
grief
remorse
tenderness
and
pity
and
throwing
herself
upon
the
bed
with
open
arms
she
also
began
to
sob
and
stammered
my
poor
little
girl
my
poor
little
girl
if
you
knew
how
you
were
hurting
me
and
they
wept
together
a
long
while
then
the
marquise
in
whom
grief
could
not
long
endure
softly
rose
and
gently
said
come
darling
it
is
unavoidable
what
would
you
have
nothing
can
be
changed
now
we
must
take
life
as
it
comes
to
us
yvette
continued
to
weep
the
blow
had
been
too
harsh
and
too
unexpected
to
permit
her
to
reflect
and
to
recover
at
once
her
mother
resumed
now
get
up
and
come
down
to
breakfast
so
that
no
one
will
notice
anything
the
young
girl
shook
her
head
as
if
to
say
no
without
being
able
to
speak
then
she
said
with
a
slow
voice
full
of
sobs
no
mamma
you
know
what
i
said
i
wo
alter
my
determination
i
shall
not
leave
my
room
till
they
have
gone
i
never
want
to
see
one
of
those
people
again
never
never
if
they
come
back
you
will
see
no
more
of
me
the
marquise
had
dried
her
eyes
and
wearied
with
emotion
she
murmured
come
reflect
be
reasonable
then
after
a
moment
silence
yes
you
had
better
rest
this
morning
i
will
come
up
to
see
you
this
afternoon
and
having
kissed
her
daughter
on
the
forehead
she
went
to
dress
herself
already
calmed
yvette
as
soon
as
her
mother
had
disappeared
rose
and
ran
to
bolt
the
door
to
be
alone
all
alone
then
she
began
to
think
the
chambermaid
knocked
about
eleven
and
asked
through
the
door
madame
the
marquise
wants
to
know
if
mademoiselle
wishes
anything
and
what
she
will
take
for
her
breakfast
yvette
answered
i
am
not
hungry
i
only
ask
not
to
be
disturbed
and
she
remained
in
bed
just
as
if
she
had
been
toward
three
some
one
knocked
again
she
asked
who
is
there
it
was
her
mother
voice
which
replied
it
is
i
darling
i
have
come
to
see
how
you
are
she
hesitated
what
she
should
do
she
opened
the
door
and
then
went
back
to
bed
the
marquise
approached
and
speaking
in
low
tones
as
people
do
to
a
convalescent
said
well
are
you
better
wo
you
eat
an
egg
no
thanks
nothing
at
all
madame
obardi
sat
down
near
the
bed
they
remained
without
saying
anything
then
finally
as
her
daughter
stayed
quiet
with
her
hands
inert
upon
the
bedclothes
she
asked
do
you
intend
to
get
up
yvette
answered
yes
pretty
soon
then
in
a
grave
and
slow
tone
she
said
i
have
thought
a
great
deal
mamma
and
this
this
is
my
resolution
the
past
is
the
past
let
us
speak
no
more
of
it
but
the
future
shall
be
different
or
i
know
what
is
left
for
me
to
do
now
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
the
marquise
who
thought
the
explanation
finished
felt
her
impatience
gaining
a
little
it
was
too
much
this
big
goose
of
a
girl
ought
to
have
known
about
things
long
ago
but
she
did
not
say
anything
in
reply
only
repeating
you
are
going
to
get
up
yes
i
am
ready
then
her
mother
became
maid
for
her
bringing
her
stockings
her
corset
and
her
skirts
then
she
kissed
her
will
you
take
a
walk
before
dinner
yes
mamma
and
they
took
a
stroll
along
the
water
speaking
only
of
commonplace
things
chapter
iv
from
emotion
to
philosophy
the
following
day
early
in
the
morning
yvette
went
out
alone
to
the
place
where
servigny
had
read
her
the
history
of
the
ants
she
said
to
herself
i
am
not
going
away
from
this
spot
without
having
formed
a
resolution
before
her
at
her
feet
the
water
flowed
rapidly
filled
with
large
bubbles
which
passed
in
silent
flight
with
deep
whirlings
she
already
had
summed
up
the
points
of
the
situation
and
the
means
of
extricating
herself
from
it
what
should
she
do
if
her
mother
would
not
accept
the
conditions
which
she
had
imposed
would
not
renounce
her
present
way
of
living
her
set
of
visitors
everything
and
go
and
hide
with
her
in
a
distant
land
she
might
go
alone
take
flight
but
where
and
how
what
would
she
live
on
by
working
at
what
to
whom
should
she
apply
to
find
work
and
then
the
dull
and
humble
life
of
daughters
of
the
people
seemed
a
little
disgraceful
unworthy
of
her
she
thought
of
becoming
a
governess
like
young
girls
in
novels
and
of
becoming
loved
by
the
son
of
the
house
and
then
marrying
him
but
to
accomplish
that
she
must
have
been
of
good
birth
so
that
when
the
exasperated
father
should
approach
her
with
having
stolen
his
son
love
she
might
say
in
a
proud
voice
my
name
is
yvette
obardi
she
could
not
do
this
and
then
even
that
would
have
been
a
trite
and
threadbare
method
the
convent
was
not
worth
much
more
besides
she
felt
no
vocation
for
a
religious
life
having
only
an
intermittent
and
fleeting
piety
no
one
would
save
her
by
marrying
her
being
what
she
was
no
aid
was
acceptable
from
a
man
no
possible
issue
no
definite
resource
and
then
she
wished
to
do
something
energetic
and
really
great
and
strong
which
should
serve
as
an
example
so
she
resolved
upon
death
she
decided
upon
this
step
suddenly
but
tranquilly
as
if
it
were
a
journey
without
reflecting
without
looking
at
death
without
understanding
that
it
is
the
end
without
recommencement
the
departure
without
return
the
eternal
farewell
to
earth
and
to
this
life
she
immediately
settled
on
this
extreme
measure
with
the
lightness
of
young
and
excited
souls
and
she
thought
of
the
means
which
she
would
employ
but
they
all
seemed
to
her
painful
and
hazardous
and
furthermore
required
a
violence
of
action
which
repelled
her
she
quickly
abandoned
the
poniard
and
revolver
which
might
wound
only
blind
her
or
disfigure
her
and
which
demanded
a
practiced
and
steady
hand
she
decided
against
the
rope
it
was
so
common
the
poor
man
way
of
suicide
ridiculous
and
ugly
and
against
water
because
she
knew
how
to
swim
so
poison
remained
but
which
kind
almost
all
of
them
cause
suffering
and
incite
vomitings
she
did
not
want
either
of
these
things
then
she
thought
of
chloroform
having
read
in
a
newspaper
how
a
young
woman
had
managed
to
asphyxiate
herself
by
this
process
and
she
felt
at
once
a
sort
of
joy
in
her
resolution
an
inner
pride
a
sensation
of
bravery
people
should
see
what
she
was
and
what
she
was
worth
she
returned
to
bougival
and
went
to
a
druggist
from
whom
she
asked
a
little
chloroform
for
a
tooth
which
was
aching
the
man
who
knew
her
gave
her
a
tiny
bottle
of
the
narcotic
then
she
set
out
on
foot
for
croissy
where
she
procured
a
second
phial
of
poison
she
obtained
a
third
at
chaton
a
fourth
at
ruril
and
got
home
late
for
breakfast
as
she
was
very
hungry
after
this
long
walk
she
ate
heartily
with
the
pleasurable
appetite
of
people
who
have
taken
exercise
her
mother
happy
to
see
her
so
hungry
and
now
feeling
tranquil
herself
said
to
her
as
they
left
the
table
all
our
friends
are
coming
to
spend
sunday
with
us
i
have
invited
the
prince
the
chevalier
and
monsieur
de
belvigne
yvette
turned
a
little
pale
but
did
not
reply
she
went
out
almost
immediately
reached
the
railway
station
and
took
a
ticket
for
paris
and
during
all
the
afternoon
she
went
from
druggist
to
druggist
buying
from
each
one
a
few
drops
of
chloroform
she
came
back
in
the
evening
with
her
pockets
full
of
little
bottles
she
began
the
same
system
on
the
following
day
and
by
chance
found
a
chemist
who
gave
her
at
one
stroke
a
quarter
of
a
liter
she
did
not
go
out
on
saturday
it
was
a
lowering
and
sultry
day
she
passed
it
entirely
on
the
terrace
stretched
on
a
long
she
thought
of
almost
nothing
very
resolute
and
very
calm
she
put
on
the
next
morning
a
blue
costume
which
was
very
becoming
to
her
wishing
to
look
well
then
looking
at
herself
in
the
glass
she
suddenly
said
i
shall
be
dead
and
a
peculiar
shudder
passed
over
her
body
dead
i
shall
speak
no
more
think
no
more
no
one
will
see
me
more
and
i
shall
never
see
anything
again
and
she
gazed
attentively
at
her
countenance
as
if
she
had
never
observed
it
examining
especially
her
eyes
discovering
a
thousand
things
in
herself
a
secret
character
in
her
physiognomy
which
she
had
not
known
before
astonished
to
see
herself
as
if
she
had
opposite
her
a
strange
person
a
new
friend
she
said
to
herself
it
is
i
in
the
mirror
there
how
queer
it
is
to
look
at
oneself
but
without
the
mirror
we
would
never
know
ourselves
everybody
else
would
know
how
we
look
and
we
ourselves
would
know
nothing
she
placed
the
heavy
braids
of
her
thick
hair
over
her
breast
following
with
her
glance
all
her
gestures
all
her
poses
and
all
her
movements
how
pretty
i
am
she
thought
tomorrow
i
shall
be
dead
there
upon
my
bed
she
looked
at
her
bed
and
seemed
to
see
herself
stretched
out
white
as
the
sheets
dead
in
a
week
she
would
be
nothing
but
dust
to
dust
returned
a
horrible
anguish
oppressed
her
heart
the
bright
sunlight
fell
in
floods
upon
the
fields
and
the
soft
morning
air
came
in
at
the
window
she
sat
down
thinking
of
it
death
it
was
as
if
the
world
was
going
to
disappear
from
her
but
no
since
nothing
would
be
changed
in
the
world
not
even
her
bedroom
yes
her
room
would
remain
just
the
same
with
the
same
bed
the
same
chairs
the
same
toilette
articles
but
she
would
be
forever
gone
and
no
one
would
be
sorry
except
her
mother
perhaps
people
would
say
how
pretty
she
was
that
little
yvette
and
nothing
more
and
as
she
looked
at
her
arm
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
she
thought
again
ashes
to
ashes
dust
to
dust
and
again
a
great
shudder
of
horror
ran
over
her
whole
body
and
she
did
not
know
how
she
could
disappear
without
the
whole
earth
being
blotted
out
so
much
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
a
part
of
everything
of
the
fields
of
the
air
of
the
sunshine
of
life
itself
there
were
bursts
of
laughter
in
the
garden
a
great
noise
of
voices
and
of
calls
the
bustling
gaiety
of
country
house
parties
and
she
recognized
the
sonorous
tones
of
de
belvigne
singing
i
am
underneath
thy
window
oh
deign
to
show
thy
face
she
rose
without
reflecting
and
looked
out
they
all
applauded
they
were
all
five
there
with
two
gentlemen
whom
she
did
not
know
she
brusquely
withdrew
annoyed
by
the
thought
that
these
men
had
come
to
amuse
themselves
at
her
mother
house
as
at
a
public
place
the
bell
sounded
for
breakfast
i
will
show
them
how
to
die
she
said
she
went
downstairs
with
a
firm
step
with
something
of
the
resolution
of
the
christian
martyrs
going
into
the
circus
where
the
lions
awaited
them
she
pressed
their
hands
smiling
in
an
affable
but
rather
haughty
manner
servigny
asked
her
are
you
less
cross
she
answered
in
a
severe
and
peculiar
tone
today
i
am
going
to
commit
follies
i
am
in
my
paris
mood
look
out
then
turning
toward
monsieur
de
belvigne
she
said
you
shall
be
my
escort
my
little
malmsey
i
will
take
you
all
after
breakfast
to
the
fete
at
marly
there
was
in
fact
a
fete
at
marly
they
introduced
the
two
newcomers
to
her
the
comte
de
tamine
and
the
marquis
de
briquetot
during
the
meal
she
said
nothing
further
strengthening
herself
to
be
gay
in
the
afternoon
so
that
no
one
should
guess
anything
so
that
they
should
be
all
the
more
astonished
and
should
say
who
would
have
thought
it
she
seemed
so
happy
so
contented
what
does
take
place
in
those
heads
she
forced
herself
not
to
think
of
the
evening
the
chosen
hour
when
they
should
all
be
upon
the
terrace
she
drank
as
much
wine
as
she
could
stand
to
nerve
herself
and
two
little
glasses
of
brandy
and
she
was
flushed
as
she
left
the
table
a
little
bewildered
heated
in
body
and
mind
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
strengthened
now
and
resolved
for
everything
let
us
start
she
cried
she
took
monsieur
de
belvigne
arm
and
set
the
pace
for
the
others
come
you
shall
form
my
battalion
servigny
i
choose
you
as
sergeant
you
will
keep
outside
the
ranks
on
the
right
you
will
make
the
foreign
guard
march
in
front
the
two
exotics
the
prince
and
the
chevalier
and
in
the
rear
the
two
recruits
who
have
enlisted
come
they
started
and
servigny
began
to
imitate
the
trumpet
while
the
two
newcomers
made
believe
to
beat
the
drum
monsieur
de
belvigne
a
little
confused
said
in
a
low
tone
mademoiselle
yvette
be
reasonable
you
will
compromise
yourself
she
answered
it
is
you
whom
i
am
compromising
raisine
as
for
me
i
do
care
much
about
it
it
will
not
occur
so
much
the
worse
for
you
you
ought
not
to
go
out
with
girls
like
me
they
went
through
bougival
to
the
amazement
of
the
all
turned
to
look
at
them
the
citizens
came
to
their
doors
the
travelers
on
the
little
railway
which
runs
from
ruril
to
marly
jeered
at
them
the
men
on
the
platforms
cried
to
the
water
with
them
yvette
marched
with
a
military
step
holding
belvigne
by
the
arm
as
a
prisoner
is
led
she
did
not
laugh
upon
her
features
sat
a
pale
seriousness
a
sort
of
sinister
calm
servigny
interrupted
his
trumpet
blasts
only
to
shout
orders
the
prince
and
the
chevalier
were
greatly
amused
finding
all
this
very
funny
and
in
good
taste
the
two
recruits
drummed
away
continually
when
they
arrived
at
the
fete
they
made
a
sensation
girls
applauded
young
men
jeered
and
a
stout
gentleman
with
his
wife
on
his
arm
said
enviously
there
are
some
people
who
are
full
of
fun
yvette
saw
the
wooden
horses
and
compelled
belvigne
to
mount
at
her
right
while
her
squad
scrambled
upon
the
whirling
beasts
behind
when
the
time
was
up
she
refused
to
dismount
constraining
her
escort
to
take
several
more
rides
on
the
back
of
these
animals
to
the
great
delight
of
the
public
who
shouted
jokes
at
them
monsieur
de
belvigne
was
livid
and
dizzy
when
he
got
off
then
she
began
to
wander
among
the
booths
she
forced
all
her
men
to
get
weighed
among
a
crowd
of
spectators
she
made
them
buy
ridiculous
toys
which
they
had
to
carry
in
their
hands
the
prince
and
the
chevalier
began
to
think
the
joke
was
being
carried
too
far
servigny
and
the
drummers
alone
did
not
seem
to
be
discouraged
they
finally
came
to
the
end
of
the
place
then
she
gazed
at
her
followers
in
a
peculiar
manner
with
a
shy
and
mischievous
glance
and
a
strange
fancy
came
to
her
mind
she
drew
them
up
on
the
bank
of
the
river
let
the
one
who
loves
me
the
most
jump
into
the
water
she
said
nobody
leaped
a
mob
gathered
behind
them
women
in
white
aprons
looked
on
in
stupor
two
troopers
in
red
breeches
laughed
loudly
she
repeated
then
there
is
not
one
of
you
capable
of
jumping
into
the
water
at
my
desire
servigny
murmured
oh
yes
there
is
and
leaped
feet
foremost
into
the
river
his
plunge
cast
a
splash
over
as
far
as
feet
a
murmur
of
astonishment
and
gaiety
arose
in
the
crowd
then
the
young
girl
picked
up
from
the
ground
a
little
piece
of
wood
and
throwing
it
into
the
stream
fetch
it
she
cried
the
young
man
began
to
swim
and
seizing
the
floating
stick
in
his
mouth
like
a
dog
he
brought
it
ashore
and
then
climbing
the
bank
he
kneeled
on
one
knee
to
present
it
yvette
took
it
you
are
handsome
said
she
and
with
a
friendly
stroke
she
caressed
his
hair
a
stout
woman
indignantly
exclaimed
are
such
things
possible
another
woman
said
can
people
amuse
themselves
like
that
a
man
remarked
i
would
not
take
a
plunge
for
that
sort
of
a
girl
she
again
took
belvigne
arm
exclaiming
in
his
face
you
are
a
goose
my
friend
you
do
know
what
you
missed
they
now
returned
she
cast
vexed
looks
on
the
how
stupid
all
these
people
seem
she
said
then
raising
her
eyes
to
the
countenance
of
her
companion
she
added
you
too
like
all
the
rest
de
belvigne
bowed
turning
around
she
saw
that
the
prince
and
the
chevalier
had
disappeared
servigny
dejected
and
dripping
ceased
playing
on
the
trumpet
and
walked
with
a
gloomy
air
at
the
side
of
the
two
wearied
young
men
who
also
had
stopped
the
drum
playing
she
began
to
laugh
dryly
saying
you
seem
to
have
had
enough
nevertheless
that
is
what
you
call
having
a
good
time
is
it
you
came
for
that
i
have
given
you
your
money
worth
then
she
walked
on
saying
nothing
further
and
suddenly
belvigne
perceived
that
she
was
weeping
astounded
he
inquired
what
is
the
matter
she
murmured
let
me
alone
it
does
not
concern
you
but
he
insisted
like
a
fool
oh
mademoiselle
come
what
is
the
matter
has
anyone
annoyed
you
she
repeated
impatiently
will
you
keep
still
then
suddenly
no
longer
able
to
resist
the
despairing
sorrow
which
drowned
her
heart
she
began
to
sob
so
violently
that
she
could
no
longer
walk
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
panting
for
breath
choked
by
the
violence
of
her
despair
belvigne
stood
still
at
her
side
quite
bewildered
repeating
i
do
understand
this
at
all
but
servigny
brusquely
came
forward
let
us
go
home
so
that
people
may
not
see
you
weeping
in
the
street
why
do
you
perpetrate
follies
like
that
when
they
only
make
you
sad
and
taking
her
arm
he
drew
her
forward
but
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
iron
gate
of
the
villa
she
began
to
run
crossed
the
garden
and
went
upstairs
and
shut
herself
in
her
room
she
did
not
appear
again
until
the
dinner
hour
very
pale
and
serious
servigny
had
bought
from
a
country
storekeeper
a
workingman
costume
with
velvet
pantaloons
a
flowered
waistcoat
and
a
blouse
and
he
adopted
the
local
dialect
yvette
was
in
a
hurry
for
them
to
finish
feeling
her
courage
ebbing
as
soon
as
the
coffee
was
served
she
went
to
her
room
again
she
heard
the
merry
voices
beneath
her
window
the
chevalier
was
making
equivocal
jokes
foreign
witticisms
vulgar
and
clumsy
she
listened
in
despair
servigny
just
a
bit
tipsy
was
imitating
the
common
workingman
calling
the
marquise
the
missus
and
all
of
a
sudden
he
said
to
saval
well
boss
that
caused
a
general
laugh
then
yvette
decided
she
first
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
wrote
bougival
sunday
nine
in
the
evening
i
die
so
that
i
may
not
become
a
kept
woman
yvette
then
in
a
postscript
adieu
my
dear
mother
pardon
she
sealed
the
envelope
and
addressed
it
to
the
marquise
obardi
then
she
rolled
her
long
chair
near
the
window
drew
a
little
table
within
reach
of
her
hand
and
placed
upon
it
the
big
bottle
of
chloroform
beside
a
handful
of
wadding
a
great
covered
with
flowers
climbing
as
high
as
her
window
exhaled
in
the
night
a
soft
and
gentle
perfume
in
light
breaths
and
she
stood
for
a
moment
enjoying
it
the
moon
in
its
first
quarter
was
floating
in
the
dark
sky
a
little
ragged
at
the
left
and
veiled
at
times
by
slight
mists
yvette
thought
i
am
going
to
die
and
her
heart
swollen
with
sobs
nearly
bursting
almost
suffocated
her
she
felt
in
her
a
need
of
asking
mercy
from
some
one
of
being
saved
of
being
loved
the
voice
of
servigny
aroused
her
he
was
telling
an
improper
story
which
was
constantly
interrupted
by
bursts
of
laughter
the
marquise
herself
laughed
louder
than
the
others
there
is
nobody
like
him
for
telling
that
sort
of
thing
she
said
laughing
yvette
took
the
bottle
uncorked
it
and
poured
a
little
of
the
liquid
on
the
cotton
a
strong
sweet
strange
odor
arose
and
as
she
brought
the
piece
of
cotton
to
her
lips
the
fumes
entered
her
throat
and
made
her
cough
then
shutting
her
mouth
she
began
to
inhale
it
she
took
in
long
breaths
of
this
deadly
vapor
closing
her
eyes
and
forcing
herself
to
stifle
in
her
mind
all
thoughts
so
that
she
might
not
reflect
that
she
might
know
nothing
more
it
seemed
to
her
at
first
that
her
chest
was
growing
larger
was
expanding
and
that
her
soul
recently
heavy
and
burdened
with
grief
was
becoming
light
light
as
if
the
weight
which
overwhelmed
her
was
lifted
wafted
away
something
lively
and
agreeable
penetrated
even
to
the
extremities
of
her
limbs
even
to
the
tips
of
her
toes
and
fingers
and
entered
her
flesh
a
sort
of
dreamy
intoxication
of
soft
fever
she
saw
that
the
cotton
was
dry
and
she
was
astonished
that
she
was
not
already
dead
her
senses
seemed
more
acute
more
subtle
more
alert
she
heard
the
lowest
whisper
on
the
terrace
prince
kravalow
was
telling
how
he
had
killed
an
austrian
general
in
a
duel
then
further
off
in
the
fields
she
heard
the
noise
of
the
night
the
occasional
barkings
of
a
dog
the
short
cry
of
the
frogs
the
almost
imperceptible
rustling
of
the
leaves
she
took
the
bottle
again
and
saturated
once
more
the
little
piece
of
wadding
then
she
began
to
breathe
in
the
fumes
again
for
a
few
moments
she
felt
nothing
then
that
soft
and
soothing
feeling
of
comfort
which
she
had
experienced
before
enveloped
her
twice
she
poured
more
chloroform
upon
the
cotton
eager
now
for
that
physical
and
mental
sensation
that
dreamy
torpor
which
bewildered
her
soul
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
had
no
more
bones
flesh
legs
or
arms
the
drug
had
gently
taken
all
these
away
from
her
without
her
perceiving
it
the
chloroform
had
drawn
away
her
body
leaving
her
only
her
mind
more
awakened
more
active
larger
and
more
free
than
she
had
ever
felt
it
she
recalled
a
thousand
forgotten
things
little
details
of
her
childhood
trifles
which
had
given
her
pleasure
endowed
suddenly
with
an
awakened
agility
her
mind
leaped
to
the
most
diverse
ideas
ran
through
a
thousand
adventures
wandered
in
the
past
and
lost
itself
in
the
events
of
the
future
and
her
lively
and
careless
thoughts
had
a
sensuous
charm
she
experienced
a
divine
pleasure
in
dreaming
thus
she
still
heard
the
voices
but
she
could
no
longer
distinguish
the
words
which
to
her
seemed
to
have
a
different
meaning
she
was
in
a
kind
of
strange
and
changing
fairyland
she
was
on
a
great
boat
which
floated
through
a
beautiful
country
all
covered
with
flowers
she
saw
people
on
the
shore
and
these
people
spoke
very
loudly
then
she
was
again
on
land
without
asking
how
and
servigny
clad
as
a
prince
came
to
seek
her
to
take
her
to
a
the
streets
were
filled
with
who
were
talking
and
she
heard
conversations
which
did
not
astonish
her
as
if
she
had
known
the
people
for
through
her
dreamy
intoxication
she
still
heard
her
mother
friends
laughing
and
talking
on
the
terrace
then
everything
became
vague
then
she
awakened
deliciously
benumbed
and
she
could
hardly
remember
what
had
happened
so
she
was
not
yet
dead
but
she
felt
so
calm
in
such
a
state
of
physical
comfort
that
she
was
not
in
haste
to
finish
with
it
she
wanted
to
make
this
exquisite
drowsiness
last
forever
she
breathed
slowly
and
looked
at
the
moon
opposite
her
above
the
trees
something
had
changed
in
her
spirit
she
no
longer
thought
as
she
had
done
just
now
the
chloroform
quieting
her
body
and
her
soul
had
calmed
her
grief
and
lulled
her
desire
to
die
why
should
she
not
live
why
should
she
not
be
loved
why
should
she
not
lead
a
happy
life
everything
appeared
possible
to
her
now
and
easy
and
certain
everything
in
life
was
sweet
everything
was
charming
but
as
she
wished
to
dream
on
still
she
poured
more
of
the
on
the
cotton
and
began
to
breathe
it
in
again
stopping
at
times
so
as
not
to
absorb
too
much
of
it
and
die
she
looked
at
the
moon
and
saw
in
it
a
face
a
woman
face
she
began
to
scorn
the
country
in
the
fanciful
intoxication
of
the
drug
that
face
swung
in
the
sky
then
it
sang
it
sang
with
a
voice
the
alleluia
of
love
it
was
the
marquise
who
had
come
in
and
seated
herself
at
the
piano
yvette
had
wings
now
she
was
flying
through
a
clear
night
above
the
wood
and
streams
she
was
flying
with
delight
opening
and
closing
her
wings
borne
by
the
wind
as
by
a
caress
she
moved
in
the
air
which
kissed
her
skin
and
she
went
so
fast
so
fast
that
she
had
no
time
to
see
anything
beneath
her
and
she
found
herself
seated
on
the
bank
of
a
pond
with
a
line
in
her
hand
she
was
fishing
something
pulled
on
the
cord
and
when
she
drew
it
out
of
the
water
it
bore
a
magnificent
pearl
necklace
which
she
had
longed
for
some
time
ago
she
was
not
at
all
astonished
at
this
deed
and
she
looked
at
servigny
who
had
come
to
her
side
she
knew
not
how
he
was
fishing
also
and
drew
out
of
the
river
a
wooden
horse
then
she
had
anew
the
feeling
of
awaking
and
she
heard
some
one
calling
down
stairs
her
mother
had
said
put
out
the
candle
then
servigny
voice
rose
clear
and
jesting
put
out
your
candle
yvette
and
all
took
up
the
chorus
yvette
put
out
your
candle
she
again
poured
chloroform
on
the
cotton
but
as
she
did
not
want
to
die
she
placed
it
far
enough
from
her
face
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
while
nevertheless
her
room
was
filled
with
the
asphyxiating
odor
of
the
narcotic
for
she
knew
that
some
one
was
coming
and
taking
a
suitable
posture
a
pose
of
the
dead
she
waited
the
marquise
said
i
am
a
little
uneasy
that
foolish
child
has
gone
to
sleep
leaving
the
light
on
her
table
i
will
send
clemence
to
put
it
out
and
to
shut
the
balcony
window
which
is
wide
open
and
soon
the
maid
rapped
on
the
door
calling
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
after
a
moment
silence
she
repeated
mademoiselle
madame
the
marquise
begs
you
to
put
out
your
candle
and
shut
the
window
clemence
waited
a
little
then
knocked
louder
and
cried
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
as
yvette
did
not
reply
the
servant
went
away
and
reported
to
the
marquise
mademoiselle
must
have
gone
to
sleep
her
door
is
bolted
and
i
could
not
awaken
her
madame
obardi
murmured
but
she
must
not
stay
like
that
then
at
the
suggestion
of
servigny
they
all
gathered
under
the
window
shouting
in
chorus
hip
hip
hurrah
yvette
their
clamor
rose
in
the
calm
night
through
the
transparent
air
beneath
the
moon
over
the
sleeping
country
and
they
heard
it
die
away
in
the
distance
like
the
sound
of
a
disappearing
train
as
yvette
did
not
answer
the
marquise
said
i
only
hope
that
nothing
has
happened
i
am
beginning
to
be
afraid
then
servigny
plucking
red
roses
from
a
big
rosebush
trained
along
the
wall
and
buds
not
yet
opened
began
to
throw
them
into
the
room
through
the
window
at
the
first
rose
that
fell
at
her
side
yvette
started
and
almost
cried
out
others
fell
upon
her
dress
others
upon
her
hair
while
others
going
over
her
head
fell
upon
the
bed
covering
it
with
a
rain
of
flowers
the
marquise
in
a
choking
voice
cried
come
yvette
answer
then
servigny
declared
truly
this
is
not
natural
i
am
going
to
climb
up
by
the
balcony
but
the
chevalier
grew
indignant
now
let
me
do
it
he
said
it
is
a
great
favor
i
ask
it
is
too
good
a
means
and
too
good
a
time
to
obtain
a
rendezvous
all
the
rest
who
thought
the
young
girl
was
joking
cried
we
protest
he
shall
not
climb
up
but
the
marquise
disturbed
repeated
and
yet
some
one
must
go
and
see
the
prince
exclaimed
with
a
dramatic
gesture
she
favors
the
duke
we
are
betrayed
let
us
toss
a
coin
to
see
who
shall
go
up
said
the
chevalier
he
took
a
piece
from
his
pocket
and
began
with
the
prince
tail
said
he
it
was
head
the
prince
tossed
the
coin
in
his
turn
saying
to
saval
call
monsieur
saval
called
head
it
was
tail
the
prince
then
gave
all
the
others
a
chance
and
they
all
lost
servigny
who
was
standing
opposite
him
exclaimed
in
his
insolent
way
parbleu
he
is
cheating
the
russian
put
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
held
out
the
gold
piece
to
his
rival
saying
toss
it
yourself
my
dear
duke
servigny
took
it
and
spinning
it
up
said
head
it
was
tail
he
bowed
and
pointing
to
the
pillar
of
the
balcony
said
climb
up
prince
but
the
prince
looked
about
him
with
a
disturbed
air
what
are
you
looking
for
asked
the
chevalier
well
i
would
like
a
ladder
a
general
laugh
followed
saval
advancing
said
we
will
help
you
he
lifted
him
in
his
arms
as
strong
as
those
of
hercules
telling
him
now
climb
to
that
balcony
the
prince
immediately
clung
to
it
and
saval
letting
him
go
he
swung
there
suspended
in
the
air
moving
his
legs
in
empty
space
then
servigny
seeing
his
struggling
legs
which
sought
a
resting
place
pulled
them
downward
with
all
his
strength
the
hands
lost
their
grip
and
the
prince
fell
in
a
heap
on
monsieur
de
belvigne
who
was
coming
to
aid
him
whose
turn
next
asked
servigny
no
one
claimed
the
privilege
come
belvigne
courage
thank
you
my
dear
boy
i
am
thinking
of
my
bones
come
chevalier
you
must
be
used
to
scaling
walls
i
give
my
place
to
you
my
dear
duke
ha
ha
that
is
just
what
i
expected
servigny
with
a
keen
eye
turned
to
the
pillar
then
with
a
leap
clinging
to
the
balcony
he
drew
himself
up
like
a
gymnast
and
climbed
over
the
balustrade
all
the
spectators
gazing
at
him
applauded
but
he
immediately
reappeared
calling
come
quick
come
quick
yvette
is
unconscious
the
marquise
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
rushed
for
the
stairs
the
young
girl
her
eyes
closed
pretended
to
be
dead
her
mother
entered
distracted
and
threw
her
self
upon
her
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
with
her
what
is
the
matter
with
her
servigny
picked
up
the
bottle
of
chloroform
which
had
fallen
upon
the
floor
she
has
drugged
herself
said
he
he
placed
his
ear
to
her
heart
then
he
added
but
she
is
not
dead
we
can
resuscitate
her
have
you
any
ammonia
the
maid
bewildered
repeated
any
what
monsieur
any
yes
monsieur
bring
them
at
once
and
leave
the
door
open
to
make
a
draft
of
air
the
marquise
on
her
knees
was
sobbing
yvette
yvette
my
daughter
my
daughter
listen
answer
me
yvette
my
child
oh
my
god
my
god
what
has
she
done
the
men
frightened
moved
about
without
speaking
bringing
water
towels
glasses
and
vinegar
some
one
said
she
ought
to
be
undressed
and
the
marquise
who
had
lost
her
head
tried
to
undress
her
daughter
but
did
not
know
what
she
was
doing
her
hands
trembled
and
faltered
and
she
groaned
i
can
not
i
can
not
the
maid
had
come
back
bringing
a
druggist
bottle
which
servigny
opened
and
from
which
he
poured
out
half
upon
a
handkerchief
then
he
applied
it
to
yvette
nose
causing
her
to
choke
good
she
breathes
said
he
it
will
be
nothing
and
he
bathed
her
temples
cheeks
and
neck
with
the
pungent
liquid
then
he
made
a
sign
to
the
maid
to
unlace
the
girl
and
when
she
had
nothing
more
on
than
a
skirt
over
her
chemise
he
raised
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
the
bed
quivering
moved
by
the
odor
and
contact
of
her
flesh
then
she
was
placed
in
bed
he
arose
very
pale
she
will
come
to
herself
he
said
it
is
nothing
for
he
had
heard
her
breathe
in
a
continuous
and
regular
way
but
seeing
all
the
men
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
yvette
in
bed
he
was
seized
with
a
jealous
irritation
and
advanced
toward
them
gentlemen
he
said
there
are
too
many
of
us
in
this
room
be
kind
enough
to
leave
us
alone
monsieur
saval
and
me
with
the
marquise
he
spoke
in
a
tone
which
was
dry
and
full
of
authority
madame
obardi
had
grasped
her
lover
and
with
her
head
uplifted
toward
him
she
cried
to
him
save
her
oh
save
her
but
servigny
turning
around
saw
a
letter
on
the
table
he
seized
it
with
a
rapid
movement
and
read
the
address
he
understood
and
thought
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
the
marquise
should
not
know
of
this
and
tearing
open
the
envelope
he
devoured
at
a
glance
the
two
lines
it
contained
i
die
so
that
i
may
not
become
a
kept
woman
yvette
adieu
my
dear
mother
pardon
the
devil
he
thought
this
calls
for
reflection
and
he
hid
the
letter
in
his
pocket
then
he
approached
the
bed
and
immediately
the
thought
came
to
him
that
the
young
girl
had
regained
consciousness
but
that
she
dared
not
show
it
from
shame
from
humiliation
and
from
fear
of
questioning
the
marquise
had
fallen
on
her
knees
now
and
was
weeping
her
head
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
suddenly
she
exclaimed
a
doctor
we
must
have
a
doctor
but
servigny
who
had
just
said
something
in
a
low
tone
to
saval
replied
to
her
no
it
is
all
over
come
go
out
a
minute
just
a
minute
and
i
promise
you
that
she
will
kiss
you
when
you
come
back
and
the
baron
taking
madame
obardi
by
the
arm
led
her
from
the
room
then
servigny
the
bed
took
yvette
hand
and
said
listen
to
me
she
did
not
answer
she
felt
so
well
so
soft
and
warm
in
bed
that
she
would
have
liked
never
to
move
never
to
speak
and
to
live
like
that
forever
an
infinite
comfort
had
encompassed
her
a
comfort
the
like
of
which
she
had
never
experienced
the
mild
night
air
coming
in
by
velvety
breaths
touched
her
temples
in
an
exquisite
almost
imperceptible
way
it
was
a
caress
like
a
kiss
of
the
wind
like
the
soft
and
refreshing
breath
of
a
fan
made
of
all
the
leaves
of
the
trees
and
of
all
the
shadows
of
the
night
of
the
mist
of
rivers
and
of
all
the
flowers
too
for
the
roses
tossed
up
from
below
into
her
room
and
upon
her
bed
and
the
roses
climbing
at
her
balcony
mingled
their
heavy
perfume
with
the
healthful
savor
of
the
evening
breeze
she
drank
in
this
air
which
was
so
good
her
eyes
closed
her
heart
reposing
in
the
yet
pervading
intoxication
of
the
drug
and
she
had
no
longer
at
all
the
desire
to
die
but
a
strong
imperious
wish
to
live
to
be
happy
no
matter
how
to
be
loved
yes
to
be
loved
servigny
repeated
yvette
listen
to
me
and
she
decided
to
open
her
eyes
he
continued
as
he
saw
her
reviving
come
come
what
does
this
nonsense
mean
she
murmured
my
poor
muscade
i
was
so
unhappy
he
squeezed
her
hand
and
that
led
you
into
a
pretty
scrape
come
you
must
promise
me
not
to
try
it
again
she
did
not
reply
but
nodded
her
head
slightly
with
an
almost
imperceptible
smile
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
letter
which
he
had
found
on
the
table
had
i
better
show
this
to
your
mother
she
shook
her
head
no
he
knew
not
what
more
to
say
for
the
situation
seemed
to
him
without
an
outlet
so
he
murmured
my
dear
child
everyone
has
hard
things
to
bear
i
understand
your
sorrow
and
i
promise
you
she
stammered
you
are
good
they
were
silent
he
looked
at
her
she
had
in
her
glance
something
of
tenderness
of
weakness
and
suddenly
she
raised
both
her
arms
as
if
she
would
draw
him
to
her
he
bent
over
her
feeling
that
she
called
him
and
their
lips
met
for
a
long
time
they
remained
thus
their
eyes
closed
but
knowing
that
he
would
lose
his
head
he
drew
away
she
smiled
at
him
now
most
tenderly
and
with
both
her
hands
clinging
to
his
shoulders
she
held
him
i
am
going
to
call
your
mother
he
said
she
murmured
just
a
second
more
i
am
so
happy
then
after
a
silence
she
said
in
a
tone
so
low
that
it
could
scarcely
be
heard
will
you
love
me
very
much
tell
me
he
kneeled
beside
her
bed
and
kissing
the
hand
she
had
given
him
said
i
adore
you
but
some
one
was
walking
near
the
door
he
arose
with
a
bound
and
called
in
his
ordinary
voice
which
seemed
nevertheless
a
little
ironical
you
may
come
in
it
is
all
right
now
the
marquise
threw
herself
on
her
daughter
with
both
arms
open
and
clasped
her
frantically
covering
her
countenance
with
tears
while
servigny
with
radiant
soul
and
quivering
body
went
out
upon
the
balcony
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
of
the
night
humming
to
himself
the
old
couplet
a
woman
changeth
oft
her
mind
yet
fools
still
trust
in
womankind
