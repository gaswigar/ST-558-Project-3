look
behind
us
i
fancy
we
are
going
to
have
a
four
heads
turned
as
if
governed
by
one
brain
four
pairs
of
eyes
of
varied
color
and
character
swept
the
wilderness
of
tender
green
and
gazed
questioningly
at
the
thunderheads
above
a
small
boy
with
an
abundance
of
yellow
curls
and
white
collar
almost
precipitated
himself
into
the
prim
lap
of
a
lady
on
the
rear
seat
auntie
will
god

fireworks
say
auntie

that
child
down
how
i
wish
parks

here
i
shall
have
nervous
prostration
within
a
sir
redmond
hayes
plucked
at
the
white
collar
and
the
small
boy
retired
between
two
masculine
forms
of
no
mean
proportions
his
voice
however
rose
higher
you
get
all
the
fireworks
you
want
young
man
without
all
that
hullabaloo
remarked
the
driver
whom
dorman
had
been
told
at
the
depot
twenty
miles
back
he
must
call
his
uncle
richard
i
love
storms
came
cheerfully
from
the
rear
seat
but
the
voice
was
not
the
prim
voice
of
do
you
have
thunder
and
lightning
out
here
dick
we
do
assented
dick
we
do
ship
it
from
the
east
in
refrigerator
cars
either
it
grows
the
cheerful
voice
was
heard
to
giggle
richard
came
in
tired
reproachful
accents
from
a
third
voice
behind
him
you
were
reared
in
the
east
i
trust
you
have
not
formed
the
pernicious
habit
of
speaking
slightingly
of
your
that
dick
knew
was
his
mother
she
had
not
changed
appreciably
since
she
had
nagged
him
through
his
teens
not
having
seen
her
since
he
was
certainly
in
a
position
to
judge
trix
asked
about
the
lightning
he
said
placatingly
just
as
he
was
accustomed
to
do
during
the
nagging
period
i
was
telling
beatrice
has
a
naturally
inquiring
mind
said
the
tired
voice
laying
reproving
stress
upon
the
name
are
you
afraid
of
lightning
sir
redmond
asked
the
cheerful
sir
redmond
twisted
his
neck
to
smile
back
at
her
no
so
long
as
it
does
actually
chuck
me
after
that
there
was
silence
so
far
as
human
voices
went
for
a
time
how
much
farther
is
it
dick
came
presently
from
the
girl
not
more
than
ten
well
maybe
twelve
miles
you
think
it
twenty
though
if
the
rain
strikes
flat
before
we
do
that
just
what
it
going
to
do
or
i
badly
mistaken
hawk
get
along
there
we
have
an
umbrella
with
us
complained
the
tired
one
beatrice
where
did
you
put
my
raglan
in
the
big
wagon
mama
along
with
the
trunks
and
guns
and
saddles
and
martha
and
katherine
and
dear
me
i
certainly
told
you
beatrice
but
mama
you
gave
it
to
me
the
last
thing
after
the
maids
were
in
the
wagon
and
said
you
would
wear
it
there
is
room
here
for
another
thing
i
feel
like
a
slice
of
pressed
auntie
i
want
some
chicken
i
hungry
auntie
i
want
some
chicken
and
a
cookie
and
i
want
some
you
wo
get
any
said
the
young
woman
with
the
tone
of
finality
you
ca
eat
me
dorman
and
i
the
only
thing
that
looks
good
enough
to
beatrice
this
of
course
from
her
mother
whose
life
seemed
principally
made
up
of
a
succession
of
mental
shocks
brought
on
by
her
youngest
dearest
and
most
irrepressible
i
have
dick
word
for
it
mama
he
said
so
at
the
i
want
some
chicken
there
is
no
chicken
dear
said
the
prim
one
you
must
be
a
patient
little
i
wo
i
hungry
mens
are
patient
when
dey
a
small
red
face
rose
like
a
tiny
harvest
moon
between
the
broad
masculine
backs
on
the
front
seat
dorman
sit
down
redmond
a
large
gloved
hand
appeared
against
the
small
moon
and
it
set
ignominiously
and
prematurely
in
the
place
where
it
had
risen
sir
redmond
further
extinguished
it
with
the
lap
robe
for
the
storm
whooping
malicious
joy
was
upon
them
first
a
blinding
glare
and
a
deafening
crash
then
rain
sheets
of
it
that
drenched
where
it
struck
the
women
huddled
together
under
the
doubtful
protection
of
the
light
robe
and
shivered
after
that
wind
that
threatened
to
overturn
the
light
spring
wagon
then
hail
that
bounced
and
hopped
like
tiny
white
rubber
balls
upon
the
ground
the
storm
passed
as
suddenly
as
it
came
but
the
effect
remained
the
road
was
sodden
with
the
water
which
had
fallen
and
as
they
went
down
the
hill
to
flat
the
horses
strained
at
the
collar
and
plodded
like
a
plow
team
the
wheels
collected
masses
of
adobe
which
stuck
like
glue
and
packed
the
spaces
between
the
spokes
twice
dick
got
out
and
poked
the
heavy
mess
from
the
wheels
with
sir
redmond
stick
which
was
not
good
for
the
stick
but
which
eased
the
drag
upon
the
horses
wonderfully
until
the
wheels
accumulated
another
load
sorry
to
dirty
your
cane
dick
apologized
after
the
second
halt
you
can
rinse
it
off
though
in
the
creek
a
few
miles
do
mention
it
said
sir
redmond
somewhat
dubiously
it
was
his
favorite
stick
and
he
had
taken
excellent
care
of
it
it
was
finely
polished
and
it
had
his
name
and
regiment
engraved
upon
the
silver
knob
and
a
date
which
the
boers
will
not
soon
forget
nor
the
english
for
that
matter
we
soon
be
over
the
worst
dick
told
them
after
a
time
when
we
climb
that
hill
we
have
a
hard
gravelly
trail
straight
to
the
ranch
i
sorry
it
had
to
storm
i
wanted
you
to
enjoy
this
i
am
enjoying
it
beatrice
assured
him
it
something
new
at
any
rate
and
anything
is
better
than
the
deadly
monotony
of
beatrice
cried
her
mother
i
ashamed
of
you
you
need
be
mama
why
wo
you
just
be
sorry
for
yourself
and
let
it
end
there
i
know
you
hated
to
come
poor
dear
but
you
think
of
letting
me
come
alone
though
i
sure
i
should
have
minded
this
is
going
to
be
a
delicious
summer
i
feel
it
in
my
why
mama
are
young
ladies
supposed
to
have
bones
young
ladies
are
not
supposed
to
make
use
of
unrefined
expressions
your
poor
there
mama
dear
dolly
did
live
upon
stilts
i
sure
even
when
she
dear
me
mama
i
hope
you
are
not
growing
peevish
peevish
elderly
people
auntie
i
want
to
go
home
the
small
boy
wailed
you
can
not
go
home
now
dear
sighed
his
guardian
angel
look
at
the
pretty
she
hesitated
groping
vaguely
for
some
object
to
which
she
might
conscientiously
apply
the
adjective
mud
suggested
beatrice
promptly
look
at
the
wheels
dorman
playing
see
now
they
say
and
roll
and
now
in
the
oven
to
bake
and
now
auntie
i
want
to
get
out
an
play
like
de
wheels
i
want
to
beatrice
why
did
you
put
that
into
his
head
her
mother
demanded
fretfully
never
mind
honey
called
beatrice
cheeringly
you
and
i
will
make
hundreds
of
mud
pies
when
we
get
to
uncle
dick
ranch
just
think
hon
oodles
of
beautiful
yellow
mud
just
beside
the
door
look
here
trix
seems
to
me
you
promising
a
whole
lot
you
make
good
i
do
live
in
a
hush
dick
do
spoil
everything
you
do
know
dorman
beatrice
what
must
miss
hayes
and
sir
redmond
think
of
you
i
sure
dorman
is
a
sweet
child
the
image
of
poor
dear
dorothea
at
his
we
all
think
dorman
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
his
father
said
his
aunt
mary
beatrice
scenting
trouble
hurried
to
change
the
subject
what
this
dick
the
missouri
river
hardly
this
is
the
water
that
did
fall
in
the
buggy
it
is
deep
it
makes
bad
going
worse
that
thinking
to
expedite
matters
he
struck
hawk
sharply
across
the
flank
it
was
a
foolish
thing
to
do
and
dick
knew
it
when
he
did
it
ten
seconds
later
he
knew
it
better
hawk
reared
tired
as
he
was
and
lunged
viciously
the
snapped
and
splintered
there
was
a
brief
interval
of
plunging
a
shower
of
muddy
water
in
that
vicinity
and
then
two
draggled
disgusted
brown
horses
splashed
indignantly
to
shore
and
took
to
the
hills
with
straps
flying
by
george
ejaculated
sir
redmond
gazing
helplessly
after
them
but
this
is
a
beastly
bit
of
luck
do
you
know
oh
you
hawk
dick
in
consideration
of
his
companions
finished
the
remark
in
the
recesses
of
his
troubled
soul
where
the
ladies
could
not
overhear
what
comes
next
dick
the
voice
of
beatrice
was
frankly
curious
next
i
have
to
wade
out
and
take
after
those
this
sentence
also
was
rounded
out
mentally
in
the
meantime
what
shall
we
do
you
stay
where
you
are
and
thank
the
good
lord
you
were
not
upset
i
sorry
turning
so
that
he
could
look
deprecatingly
at
miss
hayes
your
welcome
to
the
west
has
been
so
er
strenuous
i
try
and
make
it
up
to
you
once
you
get
to
the
ranch
i
hope
you
wo
let
this
give
you
a
dislike
of
the
oh
no
said
the
spinster
politely
i
sure
it
is
a
a
very
nice
country
well
there
nothing
to
be
done
sitting
dick
climbed
down
over
the
dashboard
into
the
mud
and
water
sir
redmond
was
not
the
man
to
shirk
duty
because
it
happened
to
be
disagreeable
as
the
regiment
whose
name
was
engraved
upon
his
cane
could
testify
he
glanced
regretfully
at
his
immaculate
leggings
and
followed
i
fancy
you
ladies
wo
need
any
bodyguard
he
said
looking
back
he
caught
the
light
of
approval
shining
in
the
eyes
of
beatrice
and
after
that
he
did
not
mind
the
mud
but
waded
to
shore
and
joined
in
the
chase
quite
contentedly
the
light
of
approval
shining
in
the
eyes
of
beatrice
meant
much
to
sir
redmond
chapter
a
handsome
cowboy
to
the
rescue
beatrice
took
immediate
possession
of
the
front
seat
that
she
might
comfort
her
heartbroken
young
nephew
never
mind
honey
they
bring
the
horses
back
in
a
minute
and
make
them
run
every
step
and
when
you
get
to
uncle
dick
ranch
see
the
nicest
things
bossy
calves
and
chickens
and
maybe
some
little
pigs
with
curly
all
this
though
alluring
failed
of
its
purpose
the
small
boy
continued
to
weep
and
his
weeping
was
be
still
dorman
or
you
certainly
scare
all
the
coyotes
to
where
are
dey
oh
all
around
you
keep
watch
hon
and
maybe
you
see
one
put
the
tip
of
his
nose
over
a
what
hill
dorman
skipped
a
sob
and
scoured
his
eyes
industriously
with
both
fists
that
hill
that
little
one
over
there
watch
close
or
you
miss
the
dove
of
peace
hovered
over
them
and
seemed
actually
about
to
alight
beatrice
leaned
back
with
a
relieved
breath
it
is
good
of
you
my
dear
to
take
so
much
trouble
sighed
his
aunt
mary
how
i
am
to
manage
without
parks
i
sure
i
can
not
you
are
tired
and
you
miss
your
soothed
beatrice
optimistic
as
to
tone
when
we
all
have
a
good
rest
we
will
be
all
right
dorman
will
find
plenty
to
amuse
him
we
are
none
of
us
exactly
comfortable
comfortable
sniffed
her
mother
i
am
half
dead
richard
wrote
such
glowing
letters
home
that
i
was
misled
if
i
had
dreamed
of
the
true
conditions
miss
hayes
i
should
never
have
sanctioned
this
wild
idea
of
beatrice
to
come
out
and
spend
the
summer
with
it
coming
there
it
is
will
it
bite
auntie
say
will
it
bite
beatrice
looked
a
horseman
came
over
the
hill
and
was
galloping
down
the
long
slope
toward
them
his
elbows
were
lifted
contrary
to
the
mandates
of
the
his
long
legs
were
encased
in
something
brown
and
fringed
down
the
sides
his
gray
hat
was
tilted
rakishly
up
at
the
back
and
down
in
front
and
a
handkerchief
was
knotted
loosely
around
his
throat
even
at
that
distance
he
struck
her
as
different
from
any
one
she
had
ever
seen
it
a
highwayman
whispered
lansell
hide
your
purse
my
dear
i
i
where
miss
hayes
was
all
with
fear
drop
it
down
beside
the
wheel
into
the
water
quick
i
shall
drop
my
he
he
is
coming
on
this
side
he
can
see
her
whisper
was
full
of
entreaty
and
despair
give
them
here
he
ca
see
on
both
sides
of
the
buggy
at
lansell
being
an
american
a
yankee
at
that
was
a
woman
of
resource
beatrice
hand
me
your
watch
quick
beatrice
paid
no
attention
and
there
was
no
time
to
insist
upon
obedience
the
horseman
had
slowed
at
the
water
edge
and
was
regarding
them
with
some
curiosity
possibly
he
was
not
accustomed
to
such
a
sight
as
the
one
that
met
his
eyes
he
came
splashing
toward
them
however
as
though
he
intended
to
investigate
the
cause
of
their
presence
alone
upon
the
prairie
in
a
vehicle
which
had
no
horses
attached
in
the
place
obviously
intended
for
such
attachment
when
he
was
close
upon
them
he
stopped
and
lifted
the
rakishly
tilted
gray
hat
you
seem
to
be
in
trouble
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
his
manner
was
grave
and
respectful
but
his
eyes
beatrice
observed
were
having
a
quiet
laugh
of
their
own
you
ca
get
auntie
watch
nor
frowed
all
down
in
the
mud
she
frowed
her
money
down
in
the
mud
too
announced
dorman
with
much
complacency
says
you
is
a
coyote
is
you
there
was
a
stunned
interval
during
which
nothing
was
heard
but
the
wind
whispering
things
to
the
grass
the
man
eyes
stopped
laughing
his
jaw
set
squarely
also
his
brows
drew
perceptibly
closer
together
it
was
lansell
opinion
that
he
looked
murderous
then
beatrice
put
her
head
down
upon
the
little
blue
velvet
cap
of
dorman
and
laughed
there
was
a
rollicking
note
in
her
laughter
that
was
irresistible
and
the
eyes
of
the
man
relented
and
joined
in
her
mirth
his
lips
forgot
they
were
angry
and
insulted
and
uncovered
some
very
nice
teeth
we
are
really
crazy
beatrice
told
him
sitting
up
straight
and
drying
her
eyes
daintily
with
her
handkerchief
we
were
on
our
way
to
lansell
ranch
and
the
horses
broke
something
and
ran
away
and
dick
lansell
has
gone
to
catch
them
we
waiting
until
he
i
from
the
look
in
his
eyes
one
might
guess
that
what
he
saw
pleased
him
which
direction
did
they
take
beatrice
waved
a
gloved
hand
vaguely
to
the
left
and
without
another
word
the
fellow
touched
his
hat
turned
and
waded
to
shore
and
galloped
over
the
ridge
she
indicated
and
the
clucketycluck
of
his
horse
hoofs
came
sharply
across
to
them
until
he
dipped
out
of
sight
you
see
he
was
a
robber
beatrice
remarked
staring
after
him
speculatively
how
well
he
rides
one
can
see
at
a
glance
that
he
almost
lives
in
the
saddle
i
wonder
who
he
for
all
you
know
beatrice
he
may
be
going
now
to
murder
richard
and
sir
redmond
in
cold
blood
he
looks
perfectly
oh
do
you
think
it
possible
cried
miss
hayes
much
alarmed
no
cried
beatrice
hotly
one
who
did
not
know
your
horror
of
novels
mama
might
suspect
you
of
feeding
your
imagination
upon
dreadfuls
i
sure
he
is

cowboys
are
as
bad
as
highwaymen

her
mother
or
worse
i
have
read
how
they
shoot
men
for
a
pastime
and
without
even
the
excuse
of

miss
hayes
faintly
no
it
is
beatrice
assured
her
indignantly
he
has
the
look
of
a
criminal

lansell
in
the
positive
tone
of
one
who
speaks
from
intimate
knowledge
of
the
subject
under
discussion
i
only
hope
he
is
going
to
murder

coming
back
mama
interrupted
beatrice
who
had
been
watching
closely
the
hilltop
no
it
that
man
and
he
is
driving

chasing

her

testily

going
to
catch
them
with
his
snare

well
lasso
where
can
richard
be
to
think
the
fellow
should
be
so
bold
but
out
here
with
miles
upon
miles
of
open
and
no
police
protection
anything
is
possible
we
might
all
be
murdered
and
no

be
the
wiser
for
days
perhaps
weeks

she
leaned
back
and
clasped
her
hands
ready
to
meet
with
fortitude
whatever
fate
might
have
in
store
he
bringing
them
out
to
us
mama
ca
you
see
the
man
is
only
trying
to
help
us
lansell
beginning
herself
to
suspect
him
of
honest
intentions
sniffed
dissentingly
and
let
it
go
at
that
the
fellow
was
certainly
leading
the
horses
toward
them
and
sir
redmond
and
dick
appearing
over
the
hill
just
then
proved
beyond
doubt
that
neither
had
been
murdered
in
cold
blood
or
in
any
other
unpleasant
manner
we
all
right
now
mother
dick
called
the
minute
he
was
near
enough
his
mother
remarked
skeptically
that
she
hoped
possibly
she
had
been
in
too
great
haste
to
conceal
her
valuables
that
miss
hayes
might
not
feel
grateful
for
her
presence
of
mind
and
was
probably
wondering
if
mud
baths
were
not
injurious
to
fine
jeweled
lansell
was
uncomfortable
mentally
and
physically
and
her
manner
was
frankly
chilly
when
her
son
presented
the
stranger
as
his
good
friend
and
neighbor
keith
cameron
she
was
still
privately
convinced
that
he
looked
a
criminal
though
if
pressed
she
must
surely
have
admitted
that
he
was
an
uncommonly
young
outlaw
it
would
seem
almost
as
if
she
regarded
his
being
a
decent
citizen
as
pure
effrontery
miss
hayes
greeted
him
with
a
smile
of
apprehension
which
plainly
amused
him
beatrice
was
frankly
impersonal
in
her
attitude
he
represented
a
new
species
of
the
genus
man
and
she
too
evidently
regarded
him
in
the
light
of
a
strange
animal
viewed
unexpectedly
at
close
range
while
he
was
helping
dick
mend
the
with
a
piece
of
rope
she
studied
him
curiously
he
was
tall
taller
even
than
sir
redmond
and
more
slender
sir
redmond
had
the
straight
sturdy
look
of
the
soldier
who
had
borne
the
brunt
of
hard
marches
and
desperate
fighting
cameron
the
lithe
unconscious
grace
and
alertness
of
the
man
whose
work
demands
quick
movement
and
quicker
eye
and
brain
his
face
was
tanned
to
a
clear
bronze
which
showed
the
blood
darkly
beneath
sir
redmond
year
of
peace
had
gone
far
toward
lightening
his
complexion
beatrice
glanced
briefly
at
him
and
admired
his
healthy
color
and
was
glad
he
did
not
have
the
look
of
an
indian
at
the
same
time
she
caught
herself
wishing
that
sir
redmond
eyes
were
hazel
fringed
with
very
long
dark
lashes
and
topped
with
very
straight
dark
brows
eyes
which
seemed
always
to
have
some
secret
cause
for
mirth
and
to
laugh
quite
independent
of
the
rest
of
the
face
still
sir
redmond
had
very
nice
eyes
blue
and
kind
and
steadfast
and
altogether
dependable
and
his
lashes
were
quite
nice
enough
for
any
one
in
just
four
seconds
beatrice
decided
that
after
all
she
did
not
like
hazel
eyes
that
twinkle
continually
they
make
one
feel
that
one
is
being
laughed
at
which
is
not
comfortable
in
six
seconds
she
was
quite
sure
that
this
cameron
thought
himself
handsome
and
beatrice
detested
a
man
who
was
proud
of
his
face
or
his
figure
such
a
man
always
tempted
her
to
make
faces
as
she
used
to
do
over
the
back
fence
when
she
was
little
she
mentally
accused
him
of
trying
to
show
off
his
skill
with
his
rope
when
he
leaned
and
fastened
it
to
the
rig
rode
out
ahead
and
helped
drag
the
vehicle
to
shore
and
it
was
with
some
resentment
that
she
observed
the
ease
with
which
he
did
it
and
how
horse
and
rope
seemed
to
know
instinctively
their
master
will
and
to
obey
of
their
own
accord
in
all
that
he
had
done
and
it
really
seemed
as
if
he
did
everything
that
needed
to
be
done
while
dick
pottered
around
in
the
way
he
had
not
found
it
necessary
to
descend
into
the
mud
and
water
to
the
ruin
of
his
picturesque
fringed
chaps
and
boots
he
had
worked
at
ease
carelessly
leaning
from
his
leathern
throne
upon
the
big
roan
horse
he
addressed
occasionally
as
redcloud
beatrice
wondered
where
he
got
the
outlandish
name
but
with
all
his
imperfections
she
was
glad
she
had
met
him
he
really
was
handsome
whether
he
knew
it
or
not
and
if
he
had
a
good
opinion
of
himself
and
overrated
his
actions
all
the
more
fun
for
herself
beatrice
i
regret
to
say
was
not
above
amusing
herself
with
handsome
young
men
who
overrate
their
own
charms
in
fact
she
had
the
reputation
among
her
women
acquaintances
of
being
a
most
outrageous
flirt
in
the
very
middle
of
these
meditations
cameron
looked
up
unexpectedly
and
met
keenly
her
eyes
and
for
some
reason
let
us
hope
because
of
a
guilty
conscience
beatrice
grew
hot
and
confused
an
unusual
experience
surely
for
a
girl
who
had
been
out
three
seasons
and
has
met
calmly
the
eyes
of
many
young
men
until
now
it
had
been
the
young
men
who
grew
hot
and
confused
it
had
never
been
herself
beatrice
turned
her
shoulder
toward
him
and
looked
at
sir
redmond
who
was
surreptitiously
fishing
for
certain
articles
beside
the
rear
wheel
at
the
whispered
behest
of
lansell
and
was
certainly
a
sight
to
behold
he
was
mud
to
his
knees
and
to
his
elbows
and
he
had
managed
to
plaster
his
hat
against
the
wheel
and
to
dirty
his
face
altogether
he
looked
an
abnormally
large
child
who
has
been
having
a
beautiful
day
of
it
in
somebody
but
beatrice
was
nearer
at
that
moment
to
loving
him
than
she
had
been
at
any
time
during
her
six
acquaintance
with
him
and
that
is
saying
much
for
she
had
liked
him
from
the
start
cameron
followed
her
glance
and
his
eyes
did
not
have
the
laugh
all
to
themselves
his
voice
joined
them
and
beatrice
turned
upon
him
and
frowned
it
was
not
kind
of
him
to
laugh
at
a
man
who
is
proving
his
heart
to
be
much
larger
than
his
vanity
beatrice
was
aware
of
sir
redmond
immaculateness
of
attire
on
most
occasions
well
said
dick
gathering
up
the
reins
you
helped
us
out
of
a
bad
scrape
keith
come
over
and
take
dinner
with
us
night
i
expect
we
be
kept
riding
the
over
at
the
pool
this
summer
unless
this
sister
of
mine
has
changed
a
lot
she
wo
rest
till
she
been
over
every
foot
of
country
for
forty
miles
around
it
will
just
about
keep
our
strings
rode
down
to
a
whisper
keeping
her
in
dear
me
richard
said
his
mother
what
jargon
is
this
you
speak
that
good
old
montana
english
mother
you
learn
it
yourself
before
you
leave
here
i
clean
forgot
how
they
used
the
english
language
at
yale
have
you
keith
just
about
keith
agreed
i
afraid
we
shock
the
ladies
terribly
dick
we
ought
to
get
out
on
a
pinnacle
with
a
good
grammar
and
well
maybe
we
look
for
you
sure
i
want
you
to
help
map
out
a
circle
or
two
for
trix
about
next
week
she
want
to
get
out
and
scour
the
dear
me
richard
beatrice
is
not
a
charwoman
this
you
will
understand
was
from
his
mother
perhaps
you
will
also
understand
that
she
spoke
with
the
rising
inflection
which
conveys
a
reproof
when
keith
cameron
left
them
he
was
laughing
quietly
to
himself
and
beatrice
chin
was
set
rather
more
than
usual
chapter
a
tilt
with
sir
redmond
beatrice
standing
on
the
top
of
a
steep
grassy
slope
was
engaged
in
the
conventional
pastime
of
enjoying
the
view
it
was
a
fine
view
but
it
was
not
half
as
good
to
look
upon
as
was
beatrice
herself
in
her
fresh
white
waist
and
brown
skirt
with
her
brown
hair
fluffing
softly
in
the
breeze
which
would
grow
to
a
respectable
wind
later
in
the
day
and
with
her
cheeks
pink
from
climbing
she
was
up
where
she
could
see
the
river
a
broad
band
of
blue
in
the
surrounding
green
winding
away
for
miles
through
the
hills
the
far
bank
stood
a
straight
two
hundred
feet
of
rock
chiseled
by
time
and
stress
of
changeful
weather
into
fanciful
turrets
and
towers
above
and
beyond
where
the
green
began
hundreds
of
moving
dots
told
where
the
cattle
were
feeding
quietly
far
away
to
the
south
heaps
of
hazy
blue
and
purple
slept
in
the
sunshine
dick
had
told
her
those
were
the
highwoods
and
away
to
the
west
a
jagged
line
of
glimmered
and
stood
upon
to
touch
the
swimming
clouds
touched
them
and
pushed
above
proudly
those
were
the
rockies
the
bear
paws
stood
behind
her
nearer
they
were
so
near
they
lost
the
glamour
of
mysterious
blue
shadows
and
became
merely
a
sprawling
group
of
huge
hills
with
ranches
dotted
here
and
there
in
sheltered
places
with
squares
of
fresh
dark
green
that
spoke
of
growing
crops
ten
days
and
the
metropolitan
east
had
faded
and
become
as
hazy
and
vague
as
the
highwoods
ten
days
and
the
witchery
of
the
west
leaped
in
her
blood
and
held
her
fast
in
its
thralldom
a
sound
of
scrambling
behind
her
was
immediately
followed
by
a
smothered
epithet
beatrice
turned
in
time
to
see
sir
redmond
pick
himself
up
these
grass
slopes
are
confounded
slippery
do
you
know
he
explained
apologetically
how
did
you
manage
that
climb
i
beatrice
smiled
i
came
around
the
end
where
the
ascent
is
gradual
there
a
good
oh
sir
redmond
sat
down
upon
a
rock
and
puffed
i
saw
you
up
here
and
a
fellow
does
think
about
taking
a
roundabout
course
to
reach
his
heart
is
it
lovely
beatrice
made
haste
to
inquire
lovely
is
half
expressive
enough
he
told
her
you
look
the
river
is
so
very
blue
and
dignified
i
been
wondering
if
it
has
forgotten
how
it
must
have
danced
through
those
hills
away
off
there
when
it
gets
down
to
the
cities
this
blue
water
it
will
be
muddy
and
nasty
looking
the
missouri
certainly
does
apply
here
and
that
farther
shore
is
simply
magnificent
i
wish
i
might
stay
here
the
lord
forbid
cried
he
with
considerable
fervor
there
a
dear
nook
in
old
england
where
i
hope
you
did
get
that
mud
off
your
leggings
i
see
beatrice
remarked
inconsequentially
james
must
have
worked
half
the
time
we
been
here
they
certainly
were
in
a
mess
the
last
time
i
saw
bother
the
leggings
but
i
take
it
that
a
good
sign
miss
lansell
your
taking
notice
of
such
beatrice
returned
to
the
landscape
i
wonder
who
originated
that
phrase
cattle
grazing
on
a
thousand
hills
he
must
have
stood
just
here
when
he
said
was
it
one
of
your
american
poets
longfellow
or
er
beatrice
simply
looked
at
him
a
minute
and
said
pshaw
well
he
retorted
you
do
know
yourself
who
it
and
to
think
beatrice
went
on
ignoring
the
subject
some
of
those
grazing
cows
and
bossy
calves
are
mine
my
very
own
i
never
cared
before
or
thought
much
about
it
till
i
came
out
and
saw
where
they
live
and
dick
pointed
to
a
cow
and
the
sweetest
little
red
and
white
calf
and
said
your
cow
and
calf
trix
they
were
dreadfully
afraid
of
me
though
i
afraid
they
did
recognize
me
as
their
mistress
i
wanted
to
get
down
and
pet
the
calf
it
had
the
dearest
little
snub
nose
but
they
bolted
and
would
let
me
near
i
fancy
they
were
not
accustomed
to
meeting
angels
sir
redmond
i
wish
you
would
you
are
so
much
nicer
when
you
not
trying
to
be
i
act
a
perfect
brute
he
offered
eagerly
if
that
will
make
you
love
it
hardly
worth
trying
i
think
you
would
make
a
very
poor
sort
of
villain
sir
redmond
you
would
even
be
sir
redmond
looked
rather
floored
he
was
a
good
fighter
was
sir
redmond
but
he
was
clumsy
at
repartee
or
perhaps
he
was
too
much
in
earnest
to
fence
gracefully
just
now
he
looked
particularly
foolish
do
you
think
my
brand
is
pretty
you
know
what
it
is
do
you
i
afraid
not
he
owned
i
fancy
i
need
a
good
bit
of
coaching
in
the
matter
of
yes
agreed
beatrice
i
fancy
you
do
my
brand
is
a
triangle
bar
like
with
a
sharp
pointed
bit
of
rock
she
drew
a
more
or
less
exact
diagram
in
the
yellow
soil
there
are
ever
so
many
different
brands
belonging
to
the
northern
pool
dick
pointed
them
out
to
me
but
i
ca
remember
them
but
whenever
you
see
a
triangle
bar
you
be
looking
at
my
individual
property
i
think
it
was
nice
of
dick
to
give
me
a
brand
all
my
own
cameron
has
a
pretty
brand
too
a
maltese
cross
the
maltese
cross
was
owned
at
one
time
by
president
roosevelt
cameron
bought
it
when
he
left
college
and
went
into
the
cattle
business
he
a
lone
hand
as
he
calls
it
but
his
cattle
range
with
the
northern
pool
and
he
and
dick
work
together
a
great
deal
i
think
he
has
lovely
eyes
do
you
the
eyes
of
beatrice
were
intent
upon
the
bear
paws
when
she
said
it
which
brought
her
shoulder
toward
sir
redmond
and
hid
her
face
from
him
i
ca
say
i
ever
observed
cameron
eyes
said
sir
redmond
stiffly
beatrice
turned
back
to
him
and
smiled
demurely
when
beatrice
smiled
that
very
demure
smile
of
which
she
was
capable
the
generally
edged
toward
their
sir
redmond
was
not
he
was
too
much
in
love
with
her
and
he
did
not
possess
a
cyclone
cellar
he
therefore
suffered
much
at
the
hands
of
beatrice
but
surely
you
must
have
noticed
that
deep
deep
dimple
in
his
chin
she
questioned
innocently
keith
cameron
i
may
say
did
not
have
a
dimple
in
his
chin
at
all
there
was
however
a
deep
crease
in
it
i
did
sir
redmond
rubbed
his
own
chin
which
was
so
far
from
dimpling
that
is
was
rounded
like
half
an
apricot
dear
me
and
you
sat
opposite
to
him
at
dinner
yesterday
too
i
suppose
then
you
did
not
observe
that
his
teeth
are
the
whitest
they
make
them
cheaply
over
here
i
told
he
retorted
setting
his
heel
emphatically
down
and
annihilating
a
red
and
black
caterpillar
now
why
did
you
do
that
i
must
say
you
english
are
rather
brutal
i
ca
abide
well
neither
can
i
and
i
think
it
would
be
foolish
to
quarrel
about
a
man
good
looks
beatrice
said
with
surprising
sweetness
sir
redmond
hunched
his
shoulders
and
retreated
to
the
comfort
of
his
pipe
a
bally
lot
of
good
looks
he
sneered
a
woman
is
never
convinced
i
beatrice
sat
down
upon
a
rock
and
rested
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
chin
in
her
hands
and
an
adorable
picture
she
made
i
assure
you
i
thoroughly
convinced
of
several
things
one
is
good
looks
another
is
that
you
oh
come
now
protested
sir
redmond
feebly
and
sucked
furiously
at
his
pipe
yes
reiterated
beatrice
examining
his
perturbed
face
judicially
you
are
downright
the
face
of
sir
redmond
grew
redder
and
more
perturbed
just
as
beatrice
meant
that
it
should
she
seemed
to
derive
a
keen
pleasure
from
goading
this
big
englishman
to
the
verge
of
apoplexy
i
sure
i
never
meant
to
be
rude
but
a
fellow
ca
fall
down
and
worship
every
young
farmer
do
you
know
not
even
to
please
you
beatrice
smiled
and
threw
a
pebble
down
the
slope
watching
it
bound
and
skip
to
the
bottom
where
it
rolled
away
and
hid
in
the
grass
i
love
this
wide
country
she
observed
abandoning
her
torture
with
a
suddenness
that
was
a
characteristic
of
her
nature
when
beatrice
had
made
a
man
look
and
act
the
fool
she
was
ready
to
stop
one
can
not
say
that
of
every
woman
one
can
draw
long
deep
breaths
without
robbing
one
neighbor
of
oxygen
everything
is
so
big
and
broad
and
generous
out
here
one
can
ride
for
miles
and
miles
through
the
grandest
wildest
places
and
there
are
any
cigar
and
and
signs
plastered
over
the
rocks
thank
goodness
if
man
has
traveled
that
way
before
you
do
not
have
the
evidence
of
his
passing
staring
you
in
the
face
you
can
make
believe
it
is
all
your
own
by
right
of
discovery
i
afraid
your
england
would
seem
rather
little
and
crowded
after
a
month
or
two
of
she
swept
her
hand
toward
the
river
and
the
beyond
and
the
mountains
rimming
the
world
you
should
see
the
moors
cried
sir
redmond
brightening
under
this
peaceful
mood
of
hers
i
fancy
you
would
not
find
trouble
in
drawing
long
breaths
there
moor
cottage
where
your
sister
and
wiltmar
lived
is
surrounded
by
wide
stretches
of
open
not
like
this
to
be
sure
but
not
in
its
way
dolly
grew
to
love
that
place
though
she
did
write
homesick
letters
at
first
i
was
going
over
after
my
coming
out
and
then
came
that
awful
accident
when
she
and
wiltmar
were
both
drowned
and
of
course
there
was
nothing
to
go
for
i
should
have
hated
the
place
then
i
think
but
i
should
like
her
voice
trailed
off
dreamily
her
eyes
on
the
hazy
highwoods
sir
redmond
watched
her
his
eyes
beatrice
in
this
mood
was
something
to
worship
he
was
almost
afraid
to
speak
for
fear
she
would
snuff
out
the
tiny
flame
of
hope
which
her
sentence
had
kindled
he
leaned
forward
his
face
eager
beatrice
only
say
you
will
go
with
me
dear
beatrice
started
for
the
moment
she
had
forgotten
him
her
eyes
kept
to
the
hills
go
to
england
one
trip
at
a
time
sir
redmond
i
have
been
here
only
ten
days
and
we
came
for
three
months
three
months
of
freedom
in
this
big
glorious
and
then
his
voice
was
husky
and
then
freckle
lotions
by
the
quart
i
sir
redmond
got
upon
his
feet
and
he
was
rather
white
around
the
mouth
we
englishmen
are
a
stubborn
lot
miss
beatrice
we
wo
stop
fighting
until
we
we
yankees
retorted
she
airily
value
our
freedom
above
everything
else
we
wo
surrender
it
without
fighting
for
it
he
caught
eagerly
at
the
lack
of
finality
in
her
tones
i
do
want
to
take
your
freedom
beatrice
i
only
want
the
right
to
love
oh
as
for
that
i
suppose
you
may
love
me
as
much
as
you
please
only
so
you
do
torment
me
to
death
talking
about
beatrice
not
looking
particularly
tormented
waved
answer
to
dick
who
was
shouting
something
up
at
her
and
went
blithely
down
the
hill
with
sir
redmond
following
gloomily
several
paces
behind
chapter
beatrice
learns
a
new
language
want
to
see
the
boys
work
a
bunch
of
cattle
trix
dick
said
to
her
when
she
came
down
to
where
he
was
leaning
against
a
high
board
fence
waiting
for
her
i
do
dicky
only
i
no
idea
what
you
the
boys
are
going
to
cut
out
some
cattle
we
contracted
to
the
government
for
the
indians
you
know
they
holding
the
bunch
over
in
dry
coulee
it
only
three
or
four
miles
i
got
to
go
over
and
see
the
foreman
and
i
thought
maybe
you
like
to
go
there
nothing
i
can
think
of
that
i
would
like
better
wo
it
be
fine
sir
redmond
sir
redmond
did
not
say
whether
he
thought
it
would
be
fine
or
not
he
still
had
the
white
streak
around
his
mouth
and
he
went
through
the
gate
and
on
to
the
house
without
a
word
which
was
undoubtedly
a
rude
thing
to
do
sir
redmond
was
not
often
rude
dick
watched
him
speculatively
until
he
was
beyond
hearing
them
then
what
have
you
done
to
milord
trix
he
wanted
to
know
nothing
said
beatrice
well
dick
said
with
decision
he
looks
to
me
like
a
man
that
has
been
turned
down
hard
i
can
tell
by
the
back
of
his
this
struck
beatrice
and
she
began
to
study
the
retreating
neck
of
her
suitor
i
ca
see
any
difference
she
announced
after
a
brief
scrutiny
it
rather
sunburned
and
i
gamble
his
mind
is
a
jumble
of
good
english
oaths
with
maybe
a
sprinkling
of
boer
maledictions
what
did
you
do
nothing
unless
perhaps
he
objects
to
being
disciplined
a
bit
but
i
also
object
to
being
badgered
into
matrimony
even
with
sir
even
with
sir
redmond
dick
whistled
he
then
is
he
beatrice
had
nothing
to
say
she
walked
beside
dick
and
looked
at
the
ground
before
her
he
does
seem
a
bad
sort
sis
and
the
title
will
be
nice
to
have
in
the
family
if
one
cares
for
such
things
mother
does
she
was
disappointed
i
take
it
that
wiltmar
was
a
younger
yes
she
was
she
used
to
think
that
sir
redmond
might
get
killed
down
there
fighting
the
boers
and
then
wiltmar
would
be
next
in
line
but
he
did
and
it
was
wiltmar
who
went
first
and
now
oh
it
humiliating
dick
to
be
thrown
at
a
man
head
tears
were
not
far
from
her
voice
just
then
i
can
see
she
wants
you
to
nab
the
title
well
sis
if
you
do
care
for
the
man
i
never
said
i
did
care
for
him
but
i
just
ca
treat
him
decently
with
mama
dinning
that
title
in
my
ears
day
and
night
i
wish
there
was
any
title
oh
it
abominable
things
have
come
to
that
point
where
an
american
girl
with
money
is
not
supposed
to
care
for
an
englishman
no
matter
how
nice
he
may
be
if
he
has
a
title
or
the
prospect
of
one
every
one
laughs
and
thinks
it
the
title
she
wants
they
think
it
of
me
and
they
say
it
they
would
say
beatrice
lansell
took
her
and
bought
her
a
lord
and
after
a
while
perhaps
sir
redmond
himself
would
it
and
i
could
bear
that
and
so
i
am
unbearably
flippant
and
i
should
think
he
hate
me
so
you
reversed
the
natural
order
of
things
and
refused
him
on
account
of
the
title
dick
grinned
surreptitiously
no
i
did
not
quite
i
afraid
he
dreadfully
angry
with
me
though
i
do
wish
he
was
such
a
you
the
same
old
trix
you
got
to
be
held
back
from
the
trail
you
supposed
to
take
or
you
wo
travel
it
you
bolt
the
other
way
if
everybody
got
together
and
fought
the
notion
you
would
probably
elope
with
milord
inside
a
week
mother
means
well
but
she
is
on
to
her
job
a
little
bit
she
ought
to
turn
up
her
nose
at
the
no
fear
of
that
i
had
it
before
my
eyes
till
i
hate
the
very
thought
of
it
i
i
wish
i
could
hate
beatrice
sighed
deeply
and
gave
her
hand
to
dorman
who
scurried
up
to
her
i
have
the
horses
saddled
right
away
said
dick
and
left
them
where

you
going
to
ride

i
afraid

beatrice
pushed
a
yellow
curl
away
from
his
eyes
with
tender
womanly
solicitude
auntie
wo

a
bother
auntie

she

beatrice
i

sorry
to
say

not
listening
she
was
wondering
if
sir
redmond
was
really
angry
with
her
too
angry
for
instance
to
go
over
where
the
cattle
were
he
really
ought
to
go
for
he
had
come
west
in
the
interest
of
the
eastern
stockholders
in
the
northern
pool
to
investigate
the
actual
details
of
the
work
he
surely
would
not
miss
this
opportunity
beatrice
thought
and
she
hoped
he
was
not
angry
yes
he
truly
did
interduced
us
he
said
dis
is
master
dorman
hayes

to
you
and
i
let

on
his
back
do

want
to
ride
on
his
back
yes
before
beatrice
had
time
to
commit
herself
they
reached
the
house
and
she
let
go
dorman
hand
and
hurried
away
to
get
into
her
dorman
straightway
went
to
find
his
six
precious
shiny
pennies
which
beatrice
had
painstakingly
scoured
with
silver
polish
one
day
to
please
the
little
tyrant
and
which
increased
their
value
many
times
so
many
times
in
fact
that
he
hid
them
every
night
in
fear
of
burglars
since
he
concealed
them
each
time
in
a
different
place
he
was
obliged
to
ransack
his
auntie
room
every
morning
to
the
great
disturbance
of
martha
the
maid
who
was
an
person
martha
appeared
just
when
he
had
triumphantly
pounced
upon
his
treasure
rolled
up
in
the
strings
of
his
aunt
chiffon
mercy
upon
us
master
dorman
whatever
have
you
been
doing
i
want
my
shiny
pennies
said
the
young
gentleman
composedly
unwinding
the
roll
to
buy
my
big
high
naughty
naughty
boy
to
muss
my
lady
fine
bonnet
like
that
look
at
things
scattered
over
the
floor
and
my
lady
fine
handkerchiefs
and
gloves
martha
stopped
and
meditated
whether
she
might
dare
to
shake
him
dorman
was
laboriously
counting
his
wealth
with
much
wrinkling
of
stubby
nose
and
lifting
of
eyebrows
having
satisfied
himself
that
they
were
really
all
there
he
deigned
to
look
around
with
a
fine
masculine
disdain
of
woman
finery
oh
dose
old
things
he
sniffed
i
always
fordet
where
i
put
my
shiny
pennies
robbers
might
find
them
if
i
put
them
easy
places
i
going
to
buy
my
big
high
pony
and
you
ca
shake
his
hand
a
bit
well
i
sure
i
do
want
to
martha
snapped
back
at
him
and
went
down
on
all
fours
to
gather
up
the
things
he
had
thrown
down
whatever
parks
was
thinking
of
to
go
and
get
fever
when
she
was
the
only
one
that
could
manage
you
i
do
know
and
me
picking
up
after
you
till
i
fair
sick
i
glad
you
is
sick
he
retorted
unfeelingly
and
backed
to
the
door
i
hopes
you
get
sicker
so
your
stummit
makes
you
hurt
you
ca
ride
on
my
big
high
get
along
with
you
and
your
high
pony
cried
the
exasperated
martha
threatening
with
a
hairbrush
dorman
his
six
shiny
pennies
held
fast
in
his
damp
little
fist
fled
down
the
stairs
and
out
into
the
sunlight
dick
and
beatrice
were
just
ready
to
ride
away
from
the
porch
i
want
to
go
wis
you
uncle
dorman
had
followed
the
lead
of
beatrice
his
divinity
he
refused
to
say
richard
though
grandmama
did
object
to
nicknames
up
you
go
son
you
be
a
yourself
one
of
these
days
i
not
let
him
fall
and
this
horse
is
this
last
to
satisfy
dorman
aunt
who
wavered
between
anxiety
and
relief
you
may
ride
to
the
gate
dorman
and
then
you
have
to
hop
down
and
run
back
to
your
auntie
and
grandma
we
going
too
far
for
you
dick
gave
him
the
reins
to
hold
and
let
the
horse
walk
to
prolong
the
joy
of
it
dorman
held
to
the
horn
with
one
hand
to
the
reins
with
the
other
and
let
his
small
body
swing
forward
and
back
with
the
motion
of
the
horse
in
exaggerated
imitation
of
his
friend
cameron
at
the
gate
he
allowed
himself
to
be
set
down
without
protest
smiled
importantly
through
the
bars
and
thrust
his
arm
through
as
far
as
it
would
reach
that
he
might
wave
and
his
divinity
smiled
back
at
him
and
threw
him
a
kiss
which
pleased
him
mightily
you
must
have
hurt
milord
feelings
pretty
bad
dick
remarked
i
could
get
him
to
come
he
had
to
write
a
letter
first
he
i
wish
dick
beatrice
answered
a
bit
petulantly
you
would
stop
calling
him
milord
a
good
name
dick
contended
it
bad
enough
to
him
to
his
face
i
ca
do
it
behind
his
back
trix
we
not
used
to
fancy
titles
out
here
and
they
do
fit
the
country
anyhow
i
like
you
i
think
a
lot
more
of
him
if
he
was
just
a
plain
everyday
american
so
i
could
get
acquainted
enough
to
call
him
hayes
like
him
a
whole
lot
beatrice
was
in
no
mood
for
an
argument
on
that
subject
at
least
she
let
rex
out
and
raced
over
the
prairie
at
a
gait
which
would
have
greatly
shocked
her
mother
who
could
not
understand
why
beatrice
was
not
content
to
drive
sedately
about
in
the
carriage
with
the
rest
of
them
when
they
reached
the
keith
cameron
left
the
bunch
and
rode
out
to
meet
them
and
dick
promptly
shuffled
responsibility
for
his
entertainment
to
the
square
shoulders
of
his
neighbor
trix
wants
to
wise
up
on
the
cattle
business
keith
i
just
turn
her
over
to
you
for
and
let
you
answer
her
questions
i
ca
half
the
time
i
want
to
look
through
the
bunch
a
keith
face
spoke
gratitude
and
spoke
it
plainly
the
face
of
beatrice
was
frankly
inattentive
she
was
watching
the
restless
moving
mass
of
red
backs
and
glistening
horns
with
horsemen
weaving
in
and
out
among
them
in
what
looked
to
her
a
perfectly
aimless
fashion
until
one
would
wheel
and
dart
out
into
the
open
always
with
a
fleeing
animal
lumbering
before
other
horsemen
would
meet
him
and
take
up
the
chase
and
he
would
turn
and
ride
leisurely
back
into
the
haze
and
confusion
it
was
like
a
kaleidoscope
for
the
scene
shifted
constantly
and
was
never
quite
the
same
keith
secure
in
her
absorption
slid
sidewise
in
the
saddle
and
studied
her
face
knowing
all
the
while
that
he
was
simply
storing
up
trouble
for
himself
but
it
is
not
given
a
man
to
flee
human
nature
and
the
fellow
who
could
sit
calmly
beside
beatrice
and
not
stare
at
her
if
the
opportunity
offered
must
certainly
have
the
blood
of
a
fish
in
his
veins
i
will
tell
you
why
beatrice
was
tall
and
she
was
slim
and
round
and
tempting
with
the
most
tantalizing
curves
ever
built
to
torment
a
man
her
hair
was
soft
and
brown
and
it
waved
up
from
the
nape
of
her
neck
without
those
short
straggling
locks
and
thin
growth
at
the
edge
which
mar
so
many
feminine
heads
and
the
sharp
contrast
of
shimmery
brown
against
ivory
white
was
simply
irresistible
had
her
face
been
less
full
of
charm
keith
might
have
been
content
to
gaze
and
gaze
at
that
lovely
hair
line
as
it
was
his
eyes
wandered
to
her
brows
also
distinctly
marked
as
though
outlined
first
with
a
pencil
in
the
fingers
of
an
artist
who
understood
and
there
were
her
lashes
dark
and
long
and
curled
up
at
the
ends
and
her
cheek
with
its
changing
coloring
her
mouth
with
its
upper
lip
creased
deeply
in
the
middle
so
deeply
that
a
bit
more
would
have
been
a
defect
and
with
an
odd
little
dimple
at
one
corner
luckily
it
was
on
the
side
toward
him
so
that
he
might
look
at
it
all
he
wanted
to
for
once
for
it
was
always
there
only
growing
deeper
and
wickeder
when
she
spoke
or
laughed
he
could
not
see
her
eyes
for
they
were
turned
away
but
he
knew
quite
well
the
color
he
had
settled
that
point
when
he
looked
up
from
coiling
his
rope
the
day
she
came
they
were
big
baffling
eyes
the
like
of
which
he
had
never
seen
before
in
his
life
and
he
had
thought
he
had
seen
every
color
and
every
shade
under
the
sun
thinking
of
them
and
their
wonderful
deeps
and
shadows
he
got
hungry
for
a
sight
of
them
and
suddenly
she
turned
to
ask
a
question
and
found
him
staring
at
her
and
surprised
a
look
in
his
eyes
he
did
not
know
was
there
for
ten
they
stared
and
the
cheeks
of
beatrice
grew
red
as
healthy
young
blood
could
paint
them
keith
were
the
same
only
that
his
blood
showed
darkly
through
the
tan
what
question
had
been
on
her
tongue
she
forgot
to
ask
indeed
for
the
time
i
think
she
forgot
the
whole
english
language
and
every
other
but
the
strange
wordless
language
of
keith
clear
eyes
and
then
it
was
gone
and
keith
was
looking
away
and
chewing
a
corner
of
his
lip
till
it
hurt
his
horse
backed
restlessly
from
the
rein
and
keith
was
guilty
of
kicking
him
with
his
spur
which
did
not
better
matters
redcloud
snorted
and
shook
his
outraged
head
and
keith
came
to
himself
and
eased
the
rein
and
spoke
remorseful
soothing
words
that
somehow
clung
long
in
the
memory
of
beatrice
just
after
that
dick
galloped
up
his
elbows
flapping
like
the
wings
of
a
frightened
hen
well
i
suppose
you
could
run
a
cow
outfit
all
by
yourself
with
the
knowledge
you
got
from
keith
he
greeted
and
two
people
became
even
more
embarrassed
than
before
if
dick
noticed
anything
he
must
have
been
a
wise
young
man
for
he
gave
no
sign
but
beatrice
had
not
queened
it
in
her
set
three
seasons
for
nothing
even
if
she
was
capable
of
being
confused
by
a
sweet
new
language
in
a
man
eyes
she
answered
dick
quietly
i
been
so
busy
watching
it
all
that
i
have
had
time
to
ask
many
questions
as
cameron
can
testify
it
like
a
game
and
it
very
fascinating
and
dusty
i
wonder
if
i
might
ride
in
among
them
dick
better
not
sis
it
is
as
much
fun
as
it
looks
and
you
can
see
more
out
here
there
comes
milord
he
must
have
changed
his
mind
about
the
beatrice
did
not
look
around
to
see
her
you
would
swear
she
had
set
herself
the
task
of
making
an
accurate
count
of
noses
in
that
seething
mass
of
raw
beef
below
her
after
a
minute
she
ventured
to
glance
furtively
at
keith
and
finding
his
eyes
turned
her
way
blushed
again
and
called
herself
an
idiot
after
that
she
straightened
in
the
saddle
and
became
the
miss
lansell
of
new
york
keith
rode
away
to
the
far
side
of
the
herd
out
of
temptation
queer
a
man
never
runs
from
a
woman
until
it
is
too
late
to
be
a
particle
of
use
keith
simply
changed
his
point
of
view
and
watched
his
desire
from
afar
chapter
the
search
for
dorman
oh
i
say
began
sir
redmond
an
hour
after
when
he
happened
to
stand
close
to
beatrice
for
a
few
minutes
where
is
dorman
i
fancied
you
brought
him
we
did
beatrice
told
him
he
only
rode
as
far
as
the
gate
where
dick
left
him
and
started
him
back
to
the
mary
told
me
he
came
along
she
and
your
mother
were
congratulating
each
other
upon
a
quiet
with
you
and
dorman
off
the
place
together
i
wager
their
felicitations
fell
rather
beatrice
laughed
very
likely
i
know
they
were
mourning
because
their
had
been
neglected
lately
what
with
that
trip
to
lost
canyon
and
to
the
mountains
friday
i
afraid
the
lace
will
continue
to
suffer
what
do
you
think
of
a
sir
redmond
it
deuced
nasty
said
he
such
a
lot
of
dust
and
noise
i
fancy
the
workmen
do
find
it
yes
they
do
they
like
it
she
declared
dick
says
a
cowboy
is
never
satisfied
off
the
range
and
you
must
call
them
workmen
sir
redmond
they
resent
it
if
they
knew
they
cowboys
and
proud
of
it
they
seem
rather
a
pleasant
lot
of
fellows
on
the
whole
i
have
been
talking
to
one
or
well
we
all
through
here
dick
announced
riding
up
i
going
to
ride
around
by
keith
place
to
see
a
horse
i
thinking
of
buying
want
to
go
along
trix
or
are
you
tired
i
never
tired
averred
his
sister
readjusting
a
and
gathering
up
her
reins
i
always
want
to
go
everywhere
that
you
take
me
dick
consider
that
point
settled
for
the
summer
are
you
coming
sir
redmond
i
think
not
thank
you
he
said
not
quite
risen
above
his
rebuff
of
the
morning
i
told
mary
i
would
be
back
for
i
was
wiser
i
refused
even
to
venture
an
opinion
as
to
when
i
should
be
back
well
you
learning
the
lingo
pretty
fast
trix
dick
chuckled
when
they
were
well
away
from
sir
redmond
milord
almost
fell
out
of
the
saddle
when
you
fired
that
at
him
where
did
you
pick
it
up
i
heard
you
say
it
a
dozen
times
since
i
came
and
i
do
care
if
he
is
shocked
i
wanted
him
to
be
he
need
be
such
a
perfect
bear
and
i
know
mama
and
miss
hayes
do
expect
him
to
lunch
without
us
he
just
did
it
to
be
jerusalem
trix
a
little
while
ago
you
said
he
was
a
dear
you
should
snub
him
if
you
want
him
to
be
nice
to
i
do
want
him
to
be
nice
flared
beatrice
i
do
care
how
he
acts
only
i
must
say
ill
humor
does
become
him
not
that
it
matters
well
i
guess
we
can
get
along
without
him
if
he
wo
honor
us
with
his
company
here
comes
keith
brace
up
sis
and
be
beatrice
glanced
casually
at
the
galloping
figure
of
dick
neighbor
and
frowned
you
must
flirt
with
keith
dick
admonished
gravely
he
a
good
fellow
and
as
square
a
man
as
i
know
but
you
ought
to
know
he
got
the
reputation
of
being
a
hard
man
to
know
lots
of
girls
have
tried
to
flirt
and
make
a
fool
of
him
and
wound
up
with
their
feelings
hurt
worse
than
his
is
that
a
dare
beatrice
threw
up
her
chin
with
a
motion
dick
knew
of
old
not
on
your
life
you
better
leave
him
alone
one
or
the
other
of
you
would
get
the
worst
of
it
and
i
hate
to
see
either
of
you
feeling
bad
as
i
said
before
he
a
bad
man
to
fool
i
do
consider
him
particularly
dangerous
or
interesting
he
not
half
as
nice
as
sir
beatrice
spoke
as
though
she
meant
what
she
said
and
dick
had
no
chance
to
argue
the
point
for
keith
pulled
up
beside
them
at
that
moment
beatrice
seemed
inclined
to
silence
and
paid
more
attention
to
the
landscape
than
she
did
to
the
conversation
which
was
mostly
about
range
conditions
and
the
scanty
water
supply
and
the
drought
she
was
politely
interested
in
keith
ranch
and
if
she
clung
persistently
to
her
society
manner
why
her
society
manner
was
very
pleasing
if
somewhat
unsatisfying
to
a
fellow
fairly
drunk
with
her
winsomeness
keith
showed
her
where
she
might
look
straight
up
the
coulee
to
her
brother
ranch
two
miles
away
and
when
she
wished
she
might
see
what
they
were
doing
up
there
he
went
in
and
got
his
she
thanked
him
prettily
and
impersonally
and
focused
the
glass
upon
dick
house
which
gave
keith
another
chance
to
look
at
her
without
being
caught
in
the
act
how
plain
everything
is
i
can
see
mama
out
on
the
porch
and
miss
she
could
also
see
sir
redmond
who
had
just
ridden
up
and
was
talking
to
the
ladies
but
she
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
mention
him
for
some
reason
she
kept
her
eyes
to
the
glass
however
and
appeared
much
absorbed
dick
rolled
himself
a
cigarette
and
watched
the
two
and
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
i
wonder
dick
i
do
think
i
afraid
beatrice
had
her
society
manner
now
she
was
her
unaffected
girlish
self
and
she
was
growing
excited
what
the
matter
dick
got
up
and
came
and
stood
at
her
elbow
they
acting
queerly
the
maids
are
running
about
and
the
cook
is
out
waving
a
large
spoon
and
mama
has
her
arm
around
miss
hayes
and
sir
let
dick
took
the
glass
and
raised
it
to
his
eyes
for
a
minute
that
right
he
said
they
making
medicine
over
something
see
what
you
make
of
it
keith
took
the
glass
and
looked
through
it
it
was
like
a
moving
picture
one
could
see
but
one
wanted
the
interpretation
of
sound
we
better
ride
over
he
said
quietly
do
worry
miss
lansell
it
probably
is
anything
serious
we
can
take
the
short
cut
up
the
coulee
and
find
he
put
the
glass
into
its
leathern
case
and
started
to
the
gate
where
the
horses
were
standing
he
did
not
tell
beatrice
that
miss
hayes
had
just
been
carried
into
the
house
in
a
faint
or
that
her
mother
was
behaving
in
an
undignified
fashion
strongly
suggesting
hysterics
but
dick
knew
from
the
look
on
his
face
that
it
was
serious
he
hurried
before
them
with
long
strides
leaving
beatrice
for
the
second
time
that
morning
to
the
care
of
his
neighbor
so
it
was
keith
who
held
his
hand
down
for
the
delicious
pressure
of
her
foot
and
arranged
her
habit
with
painstaking
care
considering
the
hurry
they
were
in
dick
was
in
the
saddle
and
gone
before
keith
had
finished
and
keith
was
not
a
slow
young
man
as
a
rule
they
ran
the
two
miles
without
a
break
except
twice
where
there
were
gates
to
close
dick
speeding
a
furlong
before
had
obligingly
left
them
open
and
a
stockman
is
hard
pressed
indeed
or
very
drunk
when
he
fails
to
close
his
gates
behind
him
it
is
an
unwritten
law
which
becomes
second
nature
almost
within
sound
of
the
place
dick
raced
back
and
met
them
and
his
face
was
white
it
dorman
he
cried
he
lost
they
have
seen
him
since
we
left
you
know
trix
he
was
standing
at
the
beatrice
went
white
as
dick
whiter
for
she
was
untanned
an
overwhelming
sense
of
blame
squeezed
her
heart
tight
keith
seeing
her
shoulders
droop
limply
reined
close
to
catch
her
in
his
arms
if
there
was
the
slightest
excuse
however
beatrice
was
a
healthy
young
woman
with
splendid
command
of
her
nerves
and
she
had
no
intention
of
fainting
the
sickening
weakness
passed
in
a
moment
it
my
fault
she
said
speaking
rapidly
her
eyes
seeking
dick
for
comfort
i
said
to
everything
he
asked
me
because
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
and
not
paying
attention
he
was
going
to
buy
your
horse
cameron
and
now
he
lost
this
though
effective
was
not
particularly
illuminating
dick
wanted
details
and
he
got
them
for
beatrice
having
remorse
to
stir
the
dregs
of
memory
repeated
nearly
everything
dorman
had
said
even
telling
how
the
big
high
pony
put
up
his
front
hand
and
he
shaked
it
and
how
dorman
truly
needed
some
little
wheels
on
his
feet
poor
little
devil
keith
muttered
with
wet
eyes
he
he
said
you
lived
over
there
beatrice
finished
pointing
as
dorman
had
pointed
which
was
not
toward
the
cross
ranch
at
all
but
straight
toward
the
river
keith
wheeled
redcloud
there
was
no
need
to
hear
more
he
took
the
hill
at
a
pace
which
would
have
killed
any
horse
but
one
bred
to
race
over
this
rough
country
near
the
top
the
forced
breathing
of
another
horse
at
his
heels
made
him
look
behind
it
was
beatrice
following
her
eyes
like
black
stars
i
do
not
know
if
keith
was
astonished
but
i
do
know
that
he
was
pleased
where
dick
was
all
he
said
then
dick
going
to
meet
the
men
the
cowboys
sir
redmond
went
after
them
when
they
found
dorman
was
anywhere
about
the
keith
nodded
understandingly
and
slowed
to
let
her
come
alongside
it
no
use
riding
in
bunches
he
remarked
after
a
little
on
circle
we
always
go
in
pairs
we
find
him
all
we
must
said
beatrice
simply
and
shaded
her
eyes
with
her
hand
for
they
had
reached
the
top
and
the
prairie
land
lay
all
about
them
and
below
lazily
asleep
in
the
sunshine
keith
halted
and
reached
for
his
glass
it
lucky
i
brought
it
along
he
said
i
was
thinking
at
the
time
i
just
slung
it
over
my
shoulder
from
it
a
good
habit
i
think
she
answered
trying
to
smile
but
her
lips
would
only
quiver
for
the
thought
of
her
blame
tortured
her
can
you
see
anything
she
ventured
wistfully
keith
shook
his
head
and
continued
his
search
there
are
so
many
little
washouts
and
coulees
down
there
you
know
that
the
trouble
with
a
glass
it
looks
only
on
a
level
but
we
find
him
do
you
worry
about
that
he
could
go
there
is
any
real
danger
is
there
oh
no
keith
said
except
he
bit
his
lip
angrily
except
what
she
demanded
i
not
silly
cameron
tell
keith
took
the
glass
from
his
eyes
looked
at
her
and
paid
her
the
compliment
of
deciding
to
tell
her
just
as
if
she
were
a
man
nothing
only
he
might
run
across
a
snake
he
said
beatrice
drew
her
breath
hard
but
she
was
plucky
keith
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
pluckier
girl
and
the
west
can
rightfully
boast
brave
women
she
touched
rex
with
the
whip
come
she
commanded
we
must
not
stand
here
it
has
been
more
than
three
keith
put
away
the
glass
and
shot
ahead
to
guide
her
we
must
have
missed
him
the
eyes
of
beatrice
were
heavy
with
the
weariness
born
of
anxiety
and
suspense
they
stood
at
the
very
edge
of
the
steep
bluff
which
rimmed
the
river
you
do
think
he
could
have
her
eyes
shuddering
down
at
the
mocking
ripples
finished
the
thought
he
could
have
got
this
far
said
keith
his
legs
would
give
out
climbing
up
and
down
we
go
back
by
a
little
different
way
and
there
something
moving
off
beatrice
pointed
with
her
whip
that
a
coyote
keith
told
her
and
then
seeing
the
look
on
her
face
they
wo
hurt
any
one
they
the
rankest
cowards
on
the
but
the
snakes
oh
well
he
might
wander
around
for
a
week
and
not
run
across
one
we
wo
borrow
trouble
no
she
agreed
languidly
the
sun
was
hot
and
she
had
not
had
anything
to
eat
since
early
breakfast
and
the
river
mocked
her
parched
throat
with
its
cool
glimmer
below
she
looked
down
at
it
wistfully
and
keith
watchful
of
every
passing
change
in
her
face
led
her
back
to
where
a
cold
little
spring
crept
from
beneath
a
rock
there
lifting
her
down
he
taught
her
how
to
drink
from
her
hand
for
himself
he
threw
himself
down
pushed
back
his
hat
and
drank
long
and
leisurely
a
brown
lock
of
hair
clinging
softly
together
with
moisture
fell
from
his
forehead
and
trailed
in
the
clear
water
and
beatrice
felt
oddly
tempted
to
push
it
back
where
it
belonged
standing
quietly
watching
his
picturesque
figure
she
forgot
for
the
moment
that
a
little
boy
was
lost
among
these
peaceful
sunbathed
hills
she
remembered
only
the
man
at
her
feet
drinking
long
satisfying
drafts
while
the
lock
of
hair
floated
in
the
spring
now
we
go
he
stood
up
and
pushed
back
the
wet
lock
which
trickled
a
tiny
stream
down
his
cheek
and
settled
his
gray
hat
in
place
again
that
day
he
felt
her
foot
in
his
palm
and
the
touch
went
over
him
in
thrills
she
was
tired
he
knew
her
foot
pressed
heavier
than
it
had
before
he
would
have
liked
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
lift
her
bodily
into
the
saddle
but
he
hardly
dared
think
of
such
a
blissful
proceeding
he
set
the
pace
slower
however
and
avoided
the
steepest
places
and
he
halted
often
on
the
higher
ground
to
scan
sharply
the
coulees
and
so
they
searched
these
two
together
and
grew
to
know
each
other
better
than
in
a
month
of
casual
meetings
and
the
grass
nodded
and
the
winds
laughed
and
the
stern
hills
looked
on
quizzically
silent
if
they
knew
aught
of
a
small
boy
with
a
wealth
of
yellow
curls
and
white
collar
they
gave
no
sign
and
the
two
rode
on
always
seeking
hopefully
a
snake
buzzed
sharply
on
a
gravelly
slope
and
keith
sending
beatrice
back
a
safe
distance
took
down
his
rope
and
gave
battle
beating
the
sinister
coil
with
the
loop
until
it
straightened
and
was
still
he
dismounted
then
and
pinched
off
the
rattles
nine
there
were
and
a
button
and
gave
them
to
beatrice
who
handled
them
gingerly
and
begged
keith
to
carry
them
for
her
he
slipped
them
into
his
pocket
and
they
went
on
saying
little
back
near
the
ranch
they
met
dick
and
sir
redmond
they
exchanged
sharp
looks
and
dick
shook
his
head
we
have
found
him
yet
the
boys
are
riding
circle
around
the
ranch
they
bound
to
find
him
some
of
them
if
we
you
had
better
go
home
sir
redmond
told
her
with
a
note
of
authority
in
his
voice
which
set
keith
teeth
on
edge
you
look
done
to
death
this
is
men
beatrice
bit
her
lip
and
barely
glanced
at
him
i
go
when
dorman
is
found
what
shall
we
do
now
dick
go
down
to
the
house
and
get
some
hot
coffee
you
two
we
all
snatched
a
bite
to
eat
and
you
need
it
after
that
you
can
look
along
the
south
side
of
the
coulee
if
you
beatrice
obediently
turned
rex
toward
home
and
keith
followed
the
ranch
seemed
very
still
and
lonesome
some
chickens
were
rolling
in
the
dust
by
the
gate
and
scattered
cackling
indignantly
when
they
rode
up
off
to
the
left
a
colt
whinnied
wistfully
in
a
corral
beatrice
riding
listlessly
to
the
house
stopped
her
horse
with
a
jerk
i
heard
where
is
he
keith
stopped
redcloud
and
listened
came
a
thumping
noise
and
a
wail
not
loud
but
unmistakable
beatrice
was
on
the
ground
as
soon
as
keith
and
together
they
ran
to
the
place
the
the
thumping
continued
vigorously
evidently
a
small
boy
was
kicking
with
all
his
might
upon
a
closed
door
it
was
not
a
new
sound
to
the
ears
of
beatrice
since
the
arrival
in
america
of
her
young
nephew
keith
flung
the
door
wide
open
upsetting
the
small
boy
who
howled
beatrice
swooped
down
upon
him
and
gathered
him
so
close
she
came
near
choking
him
you
darling
oh
dorman
dorman
squirmed
away
from
her
i
los
one
shiny
penny
and
i
could
open
de
door
help
me
find
my
shiny
keith
picked
him
up
and
set
him
upon
one
square
shoulder
we
take
you
up
to
your
auntie
first
thing
young
i
want
my
one
shiny
penny
i
want
it
dorman
showed
symptoms
of
howling
again
we
come
back
and
find
it
your
auntie
wants
you
now
and
beatrice
following
after
was
treated
to
a
rather
unusual
spectacle
that
of
a
tall
fellow
with
fringed
chaps
and
brightly
gleaming
spurs
racing
down
the
path
upon
his
shoulder
the
wriggling
form
of
an
extremely
disreputable
small
boy
with
cobwebs
in
his
curls
and
his
once
white
collar
a
dirty
rag
streaming
out
behind
chapter
lansell
lecture
when
the
excitement
had
somewhat
abated
and
miss
hayes
was
convinced
that
her
idol
was
really
there
safe
and
with
his
usual
healthy
appetite
and
when
a
messenger
had
been
started
out
to
recall
the
searchers
dorman
was
placed
upon
a
chair
before
a
select
and
attentive
audience
and
invited
to
explain
which
he
did
he
had
decided
to
borrow
some
little
wheels
from
the
bunkhouse
so
he
could
ride
his
big
high
pony
home
cameron
had
little
wheels
on
his
feet
and
so
did
uncle
dick
and
all
the
mens
the
audience
gravely
nodded
assent
well
and
the
knob
was
too
high
when
he
went
in
but
when
he
tried
to
open
the
door
to
go
out
it
was
away
up
there
dorman
measured
with
his
arm
and
he
fell
down
and
all
his
shiny
pennies
rolled
and
rolled
and
he
looked
and
looked
where
they
rolled
and
when
he
counted
one
was
gone
so
he
looked
and
looked
for
the
one
shiny
penny
till
he
was
tired
to
death
and
so
he
climbed
up
high
into
a
funny
bed
on
a
shelf
and
rested
and
when
he
was
rested
he
open
the
door
and
he
kicked
and
kicked
and
then
came
and
and
you
said
you
help
me
find
my
one
penny
he
reminded
keith
blinking
solemnly
at
him
from
the
chair
and
i
want
to
shake
hands
wis
your
big
high
pony
i
going
to
buy
him
wis
my
six
pennies
said
i
beatrice
blushed
and
keith
forgot
where
he
was
for
a
minute
looking
at
her
come
and
find
my
one
shiny
penny
dorman
commanded
climbing
down
and
i
want
to
come
can
always
find
beatrice
can
not
go
said
his
grandmother
who
did
much
like
the
way
keith
hovered
near
beatrice
nor
the
look
in
his
eyes
beatrice
is
i
want
dorman
set
up
his
everyday
howl
which
started
the
dogs
barking
outside
his
guardian
angel
attempted
to
soothe
him
but
he
would
have
none
of
her
he
only
howled
the
louder
and
kicked
there
there
honey
i
go
where
your
hat
beatrice
you
had
better
stay
in
the
house
you
have
done
quite
enough
for
one
the
tone
of
the
mother
suggested
things
it
is
imperative
said
beatrice
for
the
peace
and
the
of
this
household
that
dorman
find
his
penny
without
when
beatrice
adopted
that
lofty
tone
her
mother
was
in
the
habit
of
saying
nothing
and
biding
her
time
beatrice
was
so
apt
if
mere
loftiness
did
not
carry
the
day
to
go
a
step
further
and
flatly
refuse
to
obey
lansell
preferred
to
yield
rather
than
be
openly
defied
so
the
three
went
off
to
find
the
shiny
penny
and
in
exactly
minutes
they
found
it
i
will
not
say
that
they
could
not
have
found
it
sooner
but
at
any
rate
they
did
and
they
reached
the
house
about
two
minutes
behind
dick
and
sir
redmond
which
did
not
improve
sir
redmond
temper
to
speak
of
after
that
keith
did
not
need
much
urging
from
dick
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
at
the
pool
ranch
when
he
wanted
to
keith
could
be
very
nice
indeed
to
people
he
went
a
long
way
that
afternoon
toward
making
a
friend
of
miss
hayes
but
lansell
who
was
one
of
those
women
who
adhere
to
the
theory
of
first
impressions
in
capitals
continued
to
regard
him
as
an
incipient
outlaw
who
would
in
time
and
under
favorable
conditions
reveal
his
true
character
and
vindicate
her
keen
insight
into
human
nature
there
was
one
thing
which
lansell
never
forgave
keith
cameron
and
that
was
the
ruin
of
her
watch
which
refused
to
run
while
she
was
in
montana
that
night
when
beatrice
was
just
snuggling
down
into
the
delicious
coolness
of
her
pillow
she
heard
someone
rap
softly
but
none
the
less
imperatively
on
her
door
she
opened
one
eye
stealthily
to
see
her
mother
pudgy
form
outlined
in
the
feeble
moonlight
beatrice
are
you
asleep
beatrice
did
not
say
yes
but
she
let
her
breath
out
carefully
in
a
slumbrous
sigh
it
certainly
sounded
as
if
she
were
asleep
the
tone
though
guarded
was
insistent
the
head
of
beatrice
moved
slightly
and
settled
back
into
its
little
nest
for
all
the
world
like
a
dreaming
innocent
baby
if
she
had
not
been
the
mother
of
beatrice
lansell
would
probably
have
gone
back
to
her
room
and
continued
to
bide
her
time
but
the
mother
of
beatrice
had
learned
a
few
things
about
the
ways
of
a
wilful
girl
she
went
in
and
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
her
she
did
not
wish
to
keep
the
whole
house
awake
then
she
went
straight
to
the
bed
laid
hand
upon
a
white
shoulder
that
gleamed
in
the
moonlight
and
gave
a
shake
beatrice
i
want
you
to
answer
me
when
i
did
you
speak
mama
beatrice
opened
her
eyes
and
closed
them
opened
them
again
for
a
minute
longer
yawned
daintily
and
by
these
signs
and
tokens
wandered
back
from
dreamland
obediently
her
mother
sat
down
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
the
bed
creaked
also
beatrice
groaned
inwardly
the
time
of
reckoning
was
verily
drawing
near
she
promptly
closed
her
eyes
again
and
gave
a
sleepy
sigh
beatrice
did
you
refuse
sir
redmond
again
were
you
speaking
mama
lansell
endeavoring
to
keep
her
temper
repeated
the
question
beatrice
began
to
feel
that
she
was
an
abused
girl
she
lifted
herself
to
her
elbow
and
thumped
the
pillow
spitefully
again
dear
me
mama
i
never
refused
him
once
you
have
accepted
him
once
either
her
mother
retorted
and
beatrice
lay
down
again
i
do
wish
beatrice
you
would
look
at
the
matter
in
a
sensible
light
i
sure
i
never
would
ask
you
to
marry
a
man
you
could
not
care
for
but
sir
redmond
is
young
and
and
has
birth
and
breeding
and
money
no
one
can
accuse
him
of
being
a
i
sure
i
was
asking
richard
and
he
says
sir
redmond
holds
a
large
interest
in
the
northern
pool
and
other
english
investors
pay
him
a
salary
besides
to
look
after
their
interests
i
would
be
surprised
if
the
holdings
of
both
of
you
would
be
sufficient
to
control
the
beatrice
not
caring
anything
for
business
anyway
said
nothing
any
one
can
see
the
man
crazy
for
you
his
sister
says
he
never
cared
for
a
woman
before
in
his
of
course
put
in
beatrice
sarcastically
his
sister
followed
him
down
to
south
africa
and
all
around
and
is
in
a
position
to
any
one
can
see
he
is
a
lady
no
beatrice
smiled
reminiscently
he
certainly
and
so
he
in
deadly
earnest
and
i
positive
he
will
make
you
a
model
only
think
of
having
to
live
all
one
life
with
a
model
husband
shuddered
beatrice
hypocritically
and
then
it
something
to
marry
a
that
the
worst
of
it
remarked
beatrice
any
other
girl
in
america
would
jump
at
the
chance
i
do
believe
beatrice
you
are
hanging
back
just
to
be
aggravating
and
another
thing
beatrice
i
do
approve
of
the
way
this
keith
cameron
hangs
around
he
does
denied
beatrice
in
an
altogether
different
tone
why
mama
i
do
approve
of
flirting
beatrice
and
you
know
it
the
way
you
gadded
around
over
the
hills
with
him
a
perfect
stranger
was
disgraceful
perfectly
disgraceful
you
do
know
any
thing
about
the
fellow
whether
he
a
fit
companion
or
not
a
wild
uncouth
cowboy
he
graduated
from
yale
a
year
after
dick
and
he
was
halfback
that
does
signify
said
her
mother
a
particle
i
know
miss
hayes
was
dreadfully
shocked
to
see
you
come
riding
up
with
him
and
sir
redmond
forced
to
go
with
richard
or
ride
dick
is
good
company
said
beatrice
and
it
was
his
own
fault
i
asked
him
to
go
with
us
when
dick
and
i
left
the
cattle
and
he
would
dick
will
tell
you
the
same
and
after
that
i
did
not
see
him
until
just
before
we
i
came
home
really
mama
i
ca
have
a
on
sir
redmond
if
he
refuses
to
come
with
me
i
can
hardly
well
you
must
have
done
something
you
said
something
or
did
something
to
make
him
very
angry
he
has
not
been
himself
all
day
what
did
you
say
dear
me
mama
i
am
not
responsible
for
all
sir
redmond
i
did
not
ask
you
that
beatrice
thumped
her
pillow
again
i
do
remember
anything
very
dreadful
mama
i
i
think
he
has
i
do
wish
you
would
try
to
conquer
that
habit
of
flippancy
it
is
not
ladylike
and
i
warn
you
sir
redmond
is
not
the
man
to
dangle
after
you
forever
he
will
lose
patience
and
go
back
to
england
without
you
and
serve
you
right
i
am
only
talking
for
your
own
good
beatrice
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
you
want
him
to
leave
you
beatrice
was
not
at
all
sure
either
she
lay
still
and
wished
her
mother
would
stop
talking
for
her
good
talking
for
her
good
had
meant
as
far
back
as
beatrice
could
remember
saying
disagreeable
things
in
a
disagreeable
manner
and
remember
beatrice
i
want
this
flirting
flirting
mama
to
hear
the
girl
you
would
think
she
had
never
heard
the
word
before
that
what
i
said
beatrice
i
shall
speak
to
richard
in
the
morning
about
this
fellow
cameron
he
must
put
a
stop
to
his
being
here
of
the
time
it
is
he
and
dick
are
chums
mama
and
have
been
for
years
and
we
are
going
to
lost
canyon
you
know
and
cameron
is
to
go
along
and
there
are
several
other
trips
mama
to
which
he
is
already
invited
dick
can
not
recall
those
well
it
must
end
there
richard
must
do
something
i
can
not
see
what
he
finds
about
the
fellow
to
like
or
you
either
beatrice
just
because
he
rides
like
a
a
wild
indian
and
has
a
certain
daredevil
way
i
never
said
i
liked
him
mama
beatrice
protested
somewhat
hastily
i
of
course
i
try
to
treat
him
well
i
should
say
you
did
exploded
her
mother
angrily
you
would
be
much
better
employed
in
trying
to
treat
sir
redmond
half
as
well
it
is
positively
disgraceful
the
way
you
behave
toward
him
as
fine
a
man
as
i
ever
met
in
my
life
i
warn
you
beatrice
you
must
have
more
regard
for
propriety
or
i
shall
take
you
back
to
new
york
at
once
i
certainly
with
that
threat
which
she
shrewdly
guessed
would
go
far
toward
bringing
this
wayward
girl
to
time
lansell
got
up
off
the
bed
which
creaked
its
relief
and
groped
her
way
to
her
own
room
the
pillow
of
beatrice
received
considerable
thumping
during
the
next
hour
a
great
deal
more
in
fact
than
it
needed
two
thoughts
troubled
her
more
than
she
liked
what
if
her
mother
was
right
and
sir
redmond
lost
patience
with
her
and
went
home
that
possibility
was
unpleasant
to
say
the
least
again
would
he
give
her
up
altogether
if
she
showed
dick
she
was
not
afraid
of
keith
cameron
for
all
his
good
looks
and
at
the
same
time
taught
that
young
man
a
lesson
the
way
he
had
stared
at
her
was
nothing
less
than
a
challenge
and
beatrice
was
sorely
tempted
chapter
beatrice
wild
ride
well
are
we
all
ready
dick
gathered
up
his
reins
and
took
critical
inventory
of
the
load
his
mother
peered
under
the
front
seat
to
be
doubly
sure
that
there
were
at
least
four
umbrellas
and
her
waterproof
raglan
in
the
rig
lansell
did
not
propose
to
be
caught
unawares
in
a
storm
another
time
miss
hayes
straightened
dorman
cap
and
told
him
to
sit
down
dear
and
then
called
upon
sir
redmond
to
enforce
the
command
sir
redmond
repeated
her
command
minus
the
dear
and
then
rode
on
ahead
to
overtake
beatrice
and
keith
who
had
started
dick
climbed
up
over
the
front
wheel
released
the
brake
chirped
at
the
horses
and
they
were
off
for
lost
canyon
beatrice
was
behaving
beautifully
and
her
mother
only
hoped
to
heaven
it
would
last
the
day
out
perhaps
sir
redmond
would
be
able
to
extract
some
sort
of
a
promise
from
her
in
that
mood
lansell
reflected
as
she
watched
beatrice
chatting
to
her
two
cavaliers
with
the
most
decorous
impartiality
sir
redmond
seemed
in
high
spirits
which
argued
well
lansell
gave
herself
up
to
the
pleasure
of
the
drive
with
a
heart
free
from
anxiety
not
only
was
beatrice
at
her
best
mood
was
nothing
short
of
angelic
and
as
the
weather
was
simply
perfect
the
day
surely
promised
well
for
a
mile
keith
had
showed
signs
of
a
mind
not
at
ease
and
at
last
he
made
bold
to
speak
i
thought
rex
was
to
be
your
he
said
abruptly
to
beatrice
he
was
but
when
dick
brought
goldie
home
last
night
i
fell
in
love
with
him
on
sight
and
just
teased
dick
till
he
told
me
i
might
have
him
to
i
thought
dick
had
some
sense
keith
said
gloomily
he
has
he
knew
there
would
be
no
peace
till
he
i
did
know
you
were
going
to
ride
him
when
i
sold
him
to
dick
not
safe
for
a
does
he
buck
cameron
dick
said
he
was
beatrice
had
seen
a
horse
buck
one
day
and
had
a
wholesome
fear
of
that
form
of
equine
amusement
oh
no
i
never
knew
him
then
i
do
mind
anything
else
i
accustomed
to
horses
said
beatrice
and
smiled
welcome
to
sir
redmond
who
came
up
with
them
at
that
moment
you
want
to
ride
him
with
a
light
rein
keith
cautioned
clinging
to
the
subject
he
tenderbitted
and
nervous
he
wo
stand
for
any
jerking
you
i
never
jerk
keith
discovered
that
big
baffling
eyes
can
if
they
wish
rival
liquid
air
for
coldness
i
rode
horses
before
i
came
to
of
course
when
a
man
gets
frozen
with
a
girl
eyes
and
scorched
with
a
girl
sarcasm
the
thing
for
him
to
do
is
to
retreat
until
the
atmosphere
becomes
normal
keith
fell
behind
just
as
soon
as
he
could
do
so
with
some
show
of
dignity
and
for
several
miles
tried
to
convince
himself
that
he
would
rather
talk
to
dick
and
the
old
maid
than
not
do
you
know
sir
redmond
remarked
sympathetically
some
of
these
western
fellows
are
inclined
to
be
deuced
officious
and
sir
redmond
got
a
taste
of
the
freezing
process
that
made
him
change
the
subject
abruptly
the
way
was
rough
and
lonely
the
trail
wound
over
hills
and
through
deep
narrow
coulees
with
occasional
tantalizing
glimpses
of
the
river
and
the
open
land
beyond
that
kept
beatrice
in
a
fever
of
enthusiasm
from
riding
blithely
ahead
she
took
to
lagging
far
behind
with
her
kodak
getting
of
the
choicest
bits
of
scenery
another
cartridge
please
sir
redmond
she
said
and
wound
industriously
on
the
finished
roll
it
a
jolly
good
thing
i
brought
my
pockets
sir
redmond
fished
one
out
for
her
was
that
a
dozen
no
that
had
only
six
films
i
want
a
larger
one
this
time
it
is
a
perfect
nuisance
to
stop
and
change
be
still
goldie
we
getting
rather
a
long
way
behind
but
i
fancy
the
road
is
we
hurry
and
overtake
them
i
wo
take
any
more
until
you
chance
upon
something
you
ca
resist
i
understand
all
that
you
sir
redmond
while
he
teased
was
pondering
whether
this
was
an
auspicious
time
and
place
to
ask
beatrice
to
marry
him
he
had
tried
so
many
times
and
places
that
seemed
auspicious
that
the
man
was
growing
fearful
it
is
not
pleasant
to
have
a
girl
smile
indulgently
upon
you
and
deftly
turn
your
avowals
aside
so
that
they
fall
flat
i
ready
she
announced
blind
to
what
his
eyes
were
saying
shall
we
trek
sir
redmond
sighed
a
bit
he
was
not
anxious
to
overtake
the
others
we
will
only
out
here
people
never
sir
redmond
they
the
so
they
do
and
the
way
these
cowboys
do
it
one
would
think
they
were
couriers
by
jove
with
the
lives
of
a
whole
army
at
stake
so
i
fancy
we
had
better
hit
the
trail
eh
you
learning
beatrice
assured
him
as
they
started
on
a
year
out
here
and
you
would
be
a
real
american
sir
sir
redmond
came
near
saying
the
lord
forbid
but
he
thought
better
of
it
beatrice
was
intensely
loyal
to
her
countrymen
unfortunately
and
would
certainly
resent
such
a
remark
but
for
all
that
he
thought
it
for
a
mile
or
two
she
held
to
her
resolve
and
then
at
the
top
of
a
long
hill
overlooking
the
canyon
where
they
were
to
eat
their
lunch
out
came
her
kodak
again
this
must
be
lost
canyon
for
dick
has
stopped
by
those
trees
i
want
to
get
just
one
view
from
here
steady
goldie
dear
me
this
horse
does
detest
standing
still
i
fancy
he
is
anxious
to
get
down
with
the
others
let
me
hold
him
for
you
whoa
there
he
put
a
hand
upon
the
bridle
a
familiarity
goldie
resented
he
snorted
and
dodged
backward
to
the
ruin
of
the
picture
beatrice
was
endeavoring
to
get
now
you
frightened
him
whoa
pet
it
of
no
use
to
try
he
let
me
have
your
camera
he
getting
rather
an
ugly
temper
i
sir
redmond
put
out
his
hand
again
and
again
goldie
dodged
backward
i
can
do
better
alone
sir
the
cheeks
of
beatrice
were
red
she
managed
to
hold
the
horse
in
until
her
kodak
was
put
safely
in
its
case
but
her
temper
as
well
as
goldie
was
roughened
she
hated
spoiling
a
film
which
she
was
perfectly
sure
she
had
done
goldie
felt
the
sting
of
her
whip
when
she
brought
him
back
into
the
road
and
from
merely
fretting
he
took
to
plunging
angrily
then
when
beatrice
pulled
him
up
sharply
he
thrust
out
his
nose
grabbed
the
bit
in
his
teeth
and
bolted
down
the
hill
past
all
control
good
god
hold
him
shouted
sir
redmond
putting
his
horse
to
a
run
the
advice
was
good
and
beatrice
heard
it
plainly
enough
but
she
neither
answered
nor
looked
back
how
she
thought
resentfully
was
one
to
hold
a
yellow
streak
of
rage
with
legs
like
wire
springs
and
a
neck
of
iron
besides
she
was
angrily
alive
to
the
fact
that
keith
cameron
watching
down
below
was
having
his
revenge
she
wondered
if
he
was
enjoying
it
he
was
not
goldie
when
he
ran
ran
blindly
in
a
straight
line
and
keith
knew
it
he
also
knew
that
the
englishman
could
keep
within
gunshot
of
goldie
with
the
mount
he
had
and
half
a
mile
away
keith
shut
his
teeth
hard
together
and
went
out
to
meet
her
redcloud
lay
along
the
ground
in
great
leaps
but
keith
bending
low
over
his
neck
urged
him
faster
and
faster
until
the
horse
his
ears
laid
close
against
his
neck
did
the
best
there
was
in
him
from
the
tail
of
his
eye
keith
saw
sir
redmond
horse
go
down
upon
his
knees
and
get
up
limping
and
the
sight
filled
him
with
ungenerous
gladness
sir
redmond
was
out
of
the
race
it
was
keith
and
redcloud
they
two
and
keith
could
smile
over
it
he
saw
beatrice
hat
loosen
and
lift
in
front
flop
uncertainly
and
then
go
sailing
away
into
the
and
he
noted
where
it
fell
that
he
might
find
it
later
then
he
was
close
enough
to
see
her
face
and
wondered
that
there
was
so
little
fear
written
there
beatrice
was
plucky
and
she
rode
well
her
weight
upon
the
bit
but
her
weight
was
nothing
to
the
clinched
teeth
of
the
horse
and
though
she
had
known
it
from
the
start
she
was
scarcely
frightened
there
was
a
good
deal
of
the
daredevil
in
beatrice
she
trusted
a
great
deal
to
blind
luck
just
there
the
land
was
level
and
she
hoped
to
check
him
on
the
slope
of
the
hill
before
them
she
did
not
know
it
was
moated
like
a
castle
with
a
washout
ten
feet
deep
and
twice
that
in
width
and
that
what
looked
to
her
quite
easy
was
utterly
impossible
keith
gained
every
leap
in
a
moment
he
was
close
behind
take
your
foot
out
of
the
stirrup
he
commanded
harshly
and
though
beatrice
wondered
why
something
in
his
voice
made
her
obey
now
redcloud
nose
was
even
with
her
elbow
the
breath
from
his
nostrils
rose
hotly
in
her
face
another
bound
and
he
had
forged
ahead
neck
and
neck
with
goldie
and
it
was
keith
by
her
side
and
calm
let
go
all
hold
he
said
reaching
suddenly
he
caught
her
around
the
waist
and
pulled
her
from
the
saddle
just
as
redcloud
scenting
danger
plowed
his
front
feet
deeply
into
the
loose
soil
and
stopped
dead
still
it
was
neatly
done
and
quickly
so
quickly
that
before
beatrice
had
more
than
gasped
her
surprise
keith
lowered
her
to
the
ground
and
slid
out
of
the
saddle
beatrice
looked
at
him
and
wondered
at
his
face
and
at
the
way
he
was
shaking
he
leaned
weakly
against
the
horse
and
hid
his
face
on
his
arm
and
trembled
at
what
had
come
so
close
to
the
girl
the
girl
who
stood
there
panting
a
little
with
her
wonderful
waving
hair
cloaking
her
almost
to
her
knees
and
her
eyes
wide
and
bright
and
full
of
a
deep
amazement
she
forgot
goldie
and
did
not
even
look
to
see
what
had
become
of
him
she
forgot
nearly
everything
just
then
in
wonder
at
this
tall
young
fellow
who
never
had
seemed
to
care
what
happened
leaning
there
with
his
face
hidden
his
hat
far
hack
on
his
head
and
little
drops
standing
thickly
upon
his
forehead
she
waited
a
moment
and
when
he
did
not
move
her
thoughts
drifted
to
other
things
i
wonder
she
said
abstractedly
if
i
broke
my
keith
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
her
your
kodak
good
lord
he
looked
hard
into
her
eyes
and
she
returned
the
stare
come
here
he
commanded
hoarsely
catching
her
arm
your
kodak
look
down
there
he
led
her
to
the
brink
which
was
close
enough
to
set
him
shuddering
anew
look
there
goldie
damn
him
it
a
wonder
on
his
feet
i
thought
he
be
dead
and
serve
him
right
and
you
you
wonder
if
you
broke
your
kodak
beatrice
drew
back
from
him
and
from
the
sight
below
and
if
she
were
frightened
she
tried
not
to
let
him
see
should
i
have
fainted
she
was
proud
of
the
steadiness
of
her
voice
really
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
cameron
for
saving
me
from
an
ugly
fall
you
did
it
very
neatly
i
imagine
and
i
am
grateful
still
i
really
hope
i
break
my
kodak
are
you
very
disappointed
because
i
ca
faint
away
there
does
seem
to
be
any
brook
close
by
you
see
and
i
have
my
er
lover
arms
to
fall
into
those
are
the
regulation
stage
settings
i
believe
and
do
worry
miss
lansell
i
did
expect
you
to
faint
or
to
show
any
human
feelings
whatever
i
do
pity
your
horse
you
did
a
minute
ago
she
reminded
him
you
indulged
in
a
bit
of
profanity
if
i
for
which
i
beg
goldie
pardon
he
retorted
his
eyes
unsmiling
and
mine
i
i
think
it
rather
absurd
to
stand
here
sparring
cameron
begin
to
accuse
me
of
ingratitude
and
i
as
grateful
as
possible
for
what
you
did
sir
redmond
horse
was
too
slow
to
keep
up
or
he
would
have
been
at
hand
no
and
could
have
supplied
part
of
the
stage
setting
too
bad
he
was
keith
turned
and
readjusted
the
cinch
on
his
saddle
though
it
was
not
loose
enough
to
matter
and
before
he
had
finished
sir
redmond
rode
up
are
you
hurt
beatrice
his
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
anxious
not
at
all
cameron
kindly
helped
me
from
the
saddle
in
time
to
prevent
an
accident
i
wish
you
thank
him
sir
redmond
i
have
the
you
need
trouble
said
keith
hastily
getting
into
the
saddle
i
go
down
after
goldie
you
can
easily
find
the
camp
i
guess
without
a
then
he
galloped
away
and
left
them
and
would
not
look
back
if
he
had
done
so
he
would
have
seen
beatrice
eyes
following
him
remorsefully
also
he
would
have
seen
sir
redmond
glare
after
him
jealously
for
sir
redmond
was
not
in
a
position
to
know
that
their
had
not
been
a
pleasant
one
and
no
man
likes
to
have
another
fellow
save
the
life
of
a
woman
he
loves
while
he
himself
is
limping
painfully
up
from
the
rear
however
the
woman
he
loved
was
very
gracious
to
him
that
day
and
for
many
days
and
keith
cameron
held
himself
aloof
during
the
rest
of
the
trip
which
should
have
contented
sir
redmond
chapter
dorman
plays
cupid
dorman
toiled
up
the
steps
his
straw
hat
perilously
near
to
slipping
down
his
back
his
face
like
a
large
red
beet
and
his
hands
vainly
trying
to
reach
around
a
can
which
the
chinaman
cook
had
given
him
he
marched
straight
to
where
beatrice
was
lying
in
the
hammock
if
she
had
been
older
or
younger
or
a
plain
young
woman
one
might
say
that
beatrice
was
sulking
in
the
hammock
for
she
had
not
spoken
anything
but
yes
and
no
to
her
mother
for
an
hour
and
she
had
only
spoken
those
two
words
occasionally
when
duty
demanded
it
for
one
thing
sir
redmond
was
absent
and
had
been
for
two
weeks
and
beatrice
was
beginning
to
miss
him
dreadfully
to
beguile
the
time
she
had
ridden
every
day
long
miles
into
the
hills
three
times
she
had
met
keith
cameron
also
riding
alone
in
the
hills
and
she
had
endeavored
to
amuse
herself
with
him
after
her
own
inimitable
fashion
and
with
more
or
less
success
the
trouble
was
that
sometimes
keith
seemed
to
be
amusing
himself
with
her
which
was
not
pleasing
to
a
girl
like
beatrice
at
any
rate
he
proved
himself
quite
able
to
play
the
game
of
give
and
take
so
that
the
conscience
of
beatrice
was
at
ease
no
one
could
call
her
pastime
a
slaughter
of
the
innocents
surely
when
the
fellow
stood
his
ground
like
that
it
was
more
a
and
beatrice
enjoyed
it
very
much
she
told
herself
that
the
reason
she
enjoyed
talking
with
keith
was
because
he
was
not
always
getting
hurt
like
sir
redmond
or
if
he
did
he
kept
his
feelings
to
himself
and
went
boldly
on
with
the
game
item
beatrice
had
reversed
her
decision
that
keith
was
vain
though
she
still
felt
tempted
at
times
to
resort
to
making
faces
when
she
was
worsted
that
was
to
return
to
this
particular
day

sulking

just
enough
to
prevent
her
riding
and
so
beatrice
was
having
a
dull
day
of
it
in
the
house
besides
her
mother
had
just
finished
talking
to
her
for
her
good
which
was
enough
to
send
an
angel
into
the
sulks
and
beatrice
lacked
a
good
deal
of
being
an
angel
dorman
laid
his
can
confidingly
in
his
divinity
lap
i
did
get
some
grasshoppers

my

to
pieces
dorman
dorman
began
to
whine
he
had
never
found
his
divinity
in
so
unlovely
a
mood
i
want
to
go
now

too
hungry
looey
sam

goin
to
fry
my
fishes
for
dinner
to
auntie
come
why
do
you
go
with
the
child
beatrice
you
grow
more
selfish
every
lansell
could
not
endure
selfishness
in
others
you
know
he
will
not
give
us
any
peace
until
you
dorman
instantly
proceeded
to
make
good
his
grandmother
prophecy
and
wept
so
that
one
could
hear
him
a
mile
oh
dear
me
be
still
dorman
your
auntie
has
a
headache
well
get
your
rod
if
you
know
where
it
is
which
i
beatrice
flounced
out
of
the
hammock
and
got
her
hat
one
of
those
floppy
white
things
fluffed
with
thin
white
stuff
till
they
look
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
wisp
of
cloud
with
ribbons
to
moor
it
to
her
head
and
keep
it
from
sailing
off
to
join
its
brothers
in
the
sky
down
by
the
creek
where
the
willows
nodded
to
their
own
reflections
in
the
still
places
it
was
cool
and
sweet
scented
and
beatrice
forgot
her
grievances
and
was
not
sorry
she
had
come
it
was
at
about
this
time
that
a
tall
young
fellow
two
miles
down
the
coulee
put
away
his
field
glass
and
went
off
to
saddle
his
horse
do
run
ahead
so
dorman
beatrice
cautioned
to
her
had
been
given
the
doubtful
honor
of
carrying
the
can
of
grasshoppers
even
divinities
must
make
themselves
useful
to
man
why
dorman
swished
his
rod
in
unpleasant
proximity
to
his
divinity
head
because
honey
beatrice
dodged
you
might
step
on
a
snake
a
rattlesnake
that
would
bite
how
would
it
bite
with
its
teeth
of
course
long
wicked
teeth
with
poison
on
i
saw
one
when
i
was
ridin
on
a
horse
wis
uncle
dick
it
kept
up
till
it
was
round
and
it
growled
wis
its
tail
and
uncle
dick
chased
it
and
nen
it
unwinded
itself
and
creeped
under
a
big
rock
it
did
bite
once
and
i
did
see
any
teeth
to
carry
your
rod
still
dorman
are
you
trying
to
knock
my
hat
off
my
head
rattlesnakes
have
teeth
hon
whether
you
saw
them
or
not
i
saw
a
great
long
one
that
day
we
thought
you
were
lost
cameron
killed
it
with
his
rope
i
sure
it
had
did
it
growl
tell
me
how
it
like
this
beatrice
parted
her
lips
ever
so
little
and
a
snake
buzzed
at
dorman
feet
he
gave
a
yell
of
terror
and
backed
ingloriously
you
see
honey
if
that
had
been
really
a
snake
it
would
have
bitten
you
never
mind
dear
it
was
only
dorman
was
some
time
believing
this
astonishing
statement
how
did
you
growl
by
my
feet
show
me
beatrice
who
had
learned
some
things
at
school
which
were
not
included
in
the
curriculum
repeated
the
performance
while
dorman
watched
her
with
eyes
and
mouth
at
their
widest
like
some
older
members
of
his
sex
he
was
discovering
new
witcheries
about
his
divinity
every
day
well
he
gave
a
long
gasp
of
ecstasy
i
do
see
how
can
you
do
it
ca
i
do
it
i
afraid
not
honey
you
have
to
learn
there
was
a
queer
french
girl
at
school
who
could
do
the
strangest
things
dorman
like
fairy
tales
almost
and
she
taught
me
to
throw
my
voice
different
places
and
mimic
sounds
when
we
should
have
been
at
our
lessons
listen
hon
this
is
how
a
little
lamb
cries
when
he
is
lost
and
this
is
what
a
hungry
kittie
says
when
she
is
away
up
in
a
tree
and
is
afraid
to
come
dorman
danced
all
around
his
divinity
and
forgot
about
the
fish
until
beatrice
found
it
in
her
heart
to
regret
her
rash
revelation
of
hitherto
powers
of
entertainment
not
another
sound
dorman
she
declared
at
length
with
the
firmness
of
despair
no
i
will
not
be
a
lost
lamb
another
once
no
nor
a
hungry
kittie
either
nor
a
snake
or
anything
if
you
are
not
going
to
fish
i
shall
go
straight
back
to
the
dorman
sighed
heavily
and
permitted
his
divinity
to
fasten
a
small
grasshopper
to
his
hook
we
go
a
bit
farther
dear
down
under
those
great
trees
and
you
must
not
speak
a
word
remember
or
the
fish
will
all
run
when
she
had
settled
him
in
a
likely
place
and
the
rapt
patience
of
the
born
angler
had
folded
him
close
she
disposed
herself
comfortably
in
the
thick
grass
her
back
against
a
tree
and
took
up
the
shuttle
of
fancy
to
weave
a
wonderful
daydream
as
beautiful
intangible
as
the
lacy
summer
clouds
over
her
head
a
man
rode
quietly
over
the
grass
and
stopped
two
rods
away
that
he
might
fill
his
hungry
eyes
with
the
delicious
loveliness
of
his
desire
got
a
bite
yet
dorman
turned
and
wrinkled
his
nose
by
way
of
welcome
and
shook
his
head
vaguely
as
though
he
might
tell
of
several
unimportant
nibbles
if
it
were
worth
the
effort
beatrice
sat
a
bit
straighter
and
dexterously
whisked
some
pink
ruffles
down
over
two
distracting
ankles
and
hoped
keith
had
not
taken
notice
of
them
he
had
though
trust
a
man
for
that
keith
dismounted
dropped
the
reins
to
the
ground
and
came
and
laid
himself
down
in
the
grass
beside
his
heart
desire
and
beatrice
noticed
how
tall
he
was
and
slim
and
strong
how
did
you
know
we
were
here
she
wanted
to
know
with
lifted
eyebrows
keith
wondered
if
there
was
a
welcome
behind
that
sweet
indifferent
face
he
never
could
be
sure
of
anything
in
beatrice
face
because
it
never
was
alike
twice
it
seemed
to
him
and
if
it
spoke
welcome
for
a
second
the
next
there
was
only
raillery
or
something
equally
unsatisfying
i
saw
you
from
the
trail
he
answered
promptly
evidently
not
thinking
it
wise
to
mention
the
fieldglass
and
then
is
dick
at
home
not
that
he
wanted
dick
but
a
fellow
even
when
he
is
in
the
last
stages
of
love
feels
need
of
an
excuse
sometimes
no
we
women
are
alone
there
is
a
man
on
the
place
except
looey
sam
and
he
does
dorman
squirmed
around
till
he
could
look
at
the
two
and
his
eyebrows
were
tied
in
a
knot
i
wish
you
would
talk
you
whisper
de
fishes
wo
bite
a
all
right
honey
we
dorman
turned
back
to
his
fishing
with
a
long
breath
of
relief
his
divinity
never
broke
a
promise
if
she
could
help
it
if
dorman
hayes
had
been
cupid
himself
he
could
not
have
hit
upon
a
more
impish
arrangement
than
that
to
place
a
girl
like
beatrice
beside
a
fellow
like
keith
a
fellow
who
is
tall
and
browned
and
extremely
and
who
has
hazel
eyes
with
a
laugh
in
them
always
a
fellow
moreover
who
is
very
much
in
love
and
very
much
in
earnest
about
it
and
condemn
him
to
silence
or
to
whispers
keith
took
advantage
of
the
edict
and
moved
closer
so
that
he
could
whisper
in
comfort
and
be
nearer
his
heart
desire
he
lay
with
his
head
propped
upon
his
hand
and
his
elbow
digging
into
the
sod
and
getting
on
his
shirt
sleeve
for
the
day
was
too
warm
for
a
coat
beatrice
looking
down
at
him
observed
that
his
forearm
between
his
glove
and
was
as
white
and
smooth
as
her
own
it
is
characteristic
of
a
cowboy
to
have
a
face
brown
as
an
indian
and
hands
girlishly
white
and
soft
i
have
had
a
glimpse
of
you
for
a
week
not
since
i
met
you
down
by
the
river
where
have
you
been
he
whispered
here
rex
went
lame
and
dick
would
let
me
ride
any
other
horse
since
that
day
goldie
bolted
and
so
the
hills
have
called
in
vain
stayed
at
home
and
made
quantities
of
duchesse
lace
i
almost
finished
a
love
of
a
center
piece
and
mama
thinks
i
have
reformed
but
rex
is
better
and
tomorrow
i
going
better
help
me
hunt
some
horses
that
have
been
running
down
lost
canyon
way
i
going
to
look
for
them
keith
suggested
as
calmly
as
was
compatible
with
his
eagerness
and
his
method
of
speech
i
doubt
if
any
man
can
whisper
things
to
a
girl
he
loves
and
do
it
calmly
i
know
keith
heart
was
pounding
i
shall
probably
ride
in
the
opposite
direction
beatrice
told
him
wickedly
she
wondered
if
he
thought
she
would
run
at
his
beck
i
never
saw
you
in
this
dress
before
keith
murmured
his
eyes
caressing
no
you
may
never
again
she
said
i
have
so
many
things
to
wear
out
you
i
like
it
he
declared
as
emphatically
as
he
could
and
whisper
it
is
just
the
color
of
your
cheeks
after
the
wind
has
been
kissing
them
a
fancy
a
cowboy
saying
pretty
things
like
that
beatrice
cheeks
did
not
wait
for
the
wind
to
kiss
them
pink
only
fawncy
ye
his
eyes
were
daringly
mocking
for
shame
cameron
sir
redmond
would
not
mimic
your
good
reason
why
he
could
not
if
he
tried
a
thousand
beatrice
knew
this
was
the
truth
so
she
fell
back
upon
dignity
we
will
not
discuss
that
subject
i
i
do
want
to
anyway
i
know
another
subject
a
million
times
more
interesting
than
sir
indeed
beatrice
eyebrows
were
at
their
highest
and
what
is
it
then
you
keith
caught
her
hand
his
eyes
compelled
her
i
think
said
beatrice
drawing
her
hand
away
we
will
not
discuss
that
subject
why
keith
eyes
continued
to
woo
it
occurred
to
beatrice
that
an
unsophisticated
girl
might
easily
think
keith
in
earnest
with
that
look
in
his
eyes
dorman
scowling
at
them
over
his
shoulder
unconsciously
did
his
divinity
a
service
beatrice
pursed
her
lips
in
a
way
that
drove
keith
nearly
wild
and
took
up
the
weapon
of
silence
you
said
you
women
are
alone
where
is
milord
keith
began
again
after
two
minutes
of
lying
there
watching
her
sir
redmond
is
in
helena
on
business
he
been
making
arrangements
to
lease
a
lot
of
keith
snapped
a
twig
off
a
dead
willow
we
look
for
him
home
and
dick
drove
in
to
meet
the
so
the
pool
has
gone
to
leasing
land
the
laugh
had
gone
out
of
keith
eyes
they
were
clear
and
keen
yes
the
plan
is
to
lease
the
pine
ridge
country
and
fence
it
i
suppose
you
know
where
that
i
ought
to
keith
said
quietly
it
funny
dick
never
mentioned
it
is
dick
idea
beatrice
told
him
it
was
sir
redmond
dick
is
rather
angry
i
think
and
came
near
quarreling
with
sir
redmond
about
it
but
english
capital
controls
the
pool
you
know
and
sir
redmond
controls
the
english
capital
so
he
can
adopt
whatever
policy
he
chooses
the
way
he
explained
the
thing
to
me
it
seems
a
splendid
plan
do
you
think
so
keith
tone
was
not
quite
what
he
meant
it
to
be
he
did
not
intend
it
to
be
ironical
as
it
was
it
a
snap
for
the
pool
all
right
it
gives
them
a
cinch
on
the
best
of
the
range
and
all
the
water
i
did
give
milord
credit
for
such
business
beatrice
leaned
over
that
she
might
read
his
eyes
but
keith
turned
his
face
away
in
the
shock
of
what
he
had
just
learned
he
was
at
the
moment
not
the
lover
he
was
the
small
cattleman
who
is
being
forced
out
of
the
business
by
the
octopus
of
combined
capital
it
was
not
less
bitter
that
the
woman
he
loved
was
one
of
the
tentacles
reaching
out
to
crush
him
and
they
could
do
it
they
the
whole
affair
resolved
itself
into
a
very
simple
scheme
to
keith
the
gauntlet
had
been
thrown
down
because
of
this
girl
beside
him
it
was
not
so
much
business
acumen
as
it
was
the
antagonism
of
a
rival
that
had
prompted
the
move
keith
squared
his
shoulders
and
mentally
took
up
the
gauntlet
he
might
lose
in
the
range
fight
but
he
would
win
the
girl
if
it
were
in
the
power
of
love
to
do
it
why
that
tone
i
hope
it
is
will
it
inconvenience
you
oh
no
no
not
at
all
no
keith
seemed
to
forget
that
a
superabundance
of
negatives
breeds
suspicion
of
sincerity
i
afraid
that
means
that
it
will
and
i
sure
sir
redmond
never
meant
i
believe
that
kid
has
got
a
bite
at
last
keith
interrupted
getting
up
let
me
take
hold
there
dorman
you
be
in
the
creek
yourself
in
a
he
landed
a
fish
carefully
rebaited
the
hook
cast
the
line
into
a
promising
eddy
gave
the
rod
over
to
dorman
and
went
back
to
beatrice
who
had
been
watching
him
with
troubled
eyes
mr
cameron
if
i
had
known
beatrice
was
if
she
was
fond
of
playing
with
a
man
heart
i
hope
you
not
letting
that
business
worry
you
miss
lansell
you
remind
me
of
a
painting
i
saw
once
in
boston
it
was
called
but
this
is
august
so
i
do
apply
is
there
some
way
you
did
you
hear
about
that
up
the
line
last
week
keith
settled
himself
luxuriously
upon
his
back
with
his
hands
clasped
under
his
head
and
his
hat
tipped
down
over
his
eyes
but
not
enough
to
prevent
him
from
watching
his
heart
desire
and
in
his
eyes
laughter
and
something
sweeter
lurked
if
sir
redmond
had
wealth
to
fight
with
keith
weapon
was
far
and
away
more
dangerous
for
it
was
the
irresistible
love
of
a
masterful
man
the
love
that
sweeps
obstacles
away
like
straws
i
am
not
interested
in
beatrice
told
him
her
eyes
still
clouded
with
trouble
i
want
to
talk
about
this
they
got
one
fellow
the
next
day
and
another
got
rattled
and
gave
himself
up
but
the
leader
of
the
gang
one
of
montana
pet
outlaws
is
still
ranging
somewhere
in
the
hills
you
want
to
be
careful
about
riding
off
alone
you
ought
to
let
some
one
me
for
instance
go
along
to
look
after
pshaw
said
his
heart
desire
smiling
reluctantly
i
not
afraid
do
you
suppose
if
sir
redmond
had
known
those
fellows
made
quite
a
haul
almost
enough
to
lease
the
whole
country
if
they
wanted
to
something
over
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
a
strong
box
full
of
sand
that
the
messenger
was
going
to
fool
them
with
he
did
all
right
but
they
were
so
slow
they
hustled
around
and
got
the
money
and
he
lost
his
sand
into
the
was
that
meant
for
a
pun
beatrice
blinked
her
big
eyes
at
him
if
you
quite
through
with
the
perhaps
you
will
tell
me
how
i
glad
old
mother
nature
did
give
every
woman
an
odd
dimple
beside
the
mouth
keith
observed
reaching
for
her
hat
and
running
a
ribbon
caressingly
through
his
fingers
why
beatrice
smoothed
the
dimple
complacently
with
her
why
oh
it
would
get
kind
of
monotonous
would
it
this
from
a
man
known
chiefly
for
his
pretty
speeches
laugh
had
a
faint
tinge
of
chagrin
would
pretty
speeches
get
monotonous
too
keith
eyes
were
laughing
at
her
yours
would
she
retorted
spitefully
and
immediately
bit
her
lip
and
hoped
he
would
not
consider
that
a
bid
for
more
pretty
speeches
dis
hopper
is
wilted
came
a
sepulchral
whisper
from
dorman
keith
sighed
and
went
and
baited
the
hook
again
when
he
returned
to
beatrice
his
mood
had
changed
i
want
you
to
promise
i
never
make
promises
of
any
sort
beatrice
had
fallen
back
upon
her
airy
tone
which
was
her
strongest
weapon
of
defense
unless
one
except
her
smile
i
was
thinking
of
asking
much
keith
went
on
coolly
i
only
wanted
to
ask
you
not
to
worry
about
that
leasing
are
you
worrying
about
it
cameron
that
is
the
point
no
i
ca
say
i
expect
to
lose
sleep
over
it
i
hope
you
will
dismiss
anything
i
may
have
said
from
your
but
i
do
understand
i
feel
that
you
blame
sir
redmond
when
sure
he
i
did
not
say
i
blamed
anybody
i
think
we
not
discuss
yes
i
think
we
shall
you
tell
me
all
about
it
if
i
want
to
beatrice
adopted
her
coaxing
tone
which
never
had
failed
her
oh
no
keith
laughed
a
little
a
girl
ca
always
have
her
own
way
just
because
she
wants
it
even
if
she
i
got
a
fish
dorman
squealed
and
keith
was
obliged
to
devote
another
five
minutes
to
diplomacy
i
think
you
have
fished
long
enough
honey
beatrice
told
dorman
decidedly
it
nearly
dinner
time
and
looey
sam
wo
have
time
to
fry
your
fish
if
you
do
hurry
home
shall
i
tell
dick
you
wished
to
see
him
cameron
it
nothing
important
so
i
wo
trouble
you
keith
replied
in
a
tone
that
matched
hers
for
cool
courtesy
i
see
him
he
helped
dorman
reel
in
his
line
cut
a
and
strung
the
three
fish
upon
it
by
the
gills
washed
his
hands
leisurely
in
the
creek
and
dried
them
on
his
handkerchief
just
as
if
nothing
bothered
him
in
the
slightest
degree
then
he
went
over
and
smoothed
redcloud
mane
and
pulled
a
wisp
of
forelock
from
under
the
and
commanded
him
to
shake
hands
which
the
horse
did
promptly
i
want
to
shake
hands
wis
your
pony
too
dorman
cried
and
dropped
pole
and
fish
heedlessly
into
the
grass
all
right
dorman
went
up
gravely
and
clasped
redcloud
raised
fetlock
solemnly
while
the
tall
smiled
down
at
him
kiss
him
redcloud
he
said
softly
and
then
when
the
horse
nose
was
thrust
in
his
face
no
not
me
kiss
the
he
lifted
the
child
up
in
his
arms
and
when
redcloud
touched
his
soft
nose
to
cheek
and
lifted
his
lip
for
a
dainty
toothless
nibble
dorman
was
speechless
with
fright
and
rapture
thrillingly
combined
now
run
home
with
your
fish
it
lacks
only
two
hours
and
forty
minutes
to
dinner
time
and
it
will
take
at
least
twenty
minutes
for
the
fish
to
fry
so
you
see
you
have
to
beatrice
flushed
and
looked
at
him
sharply
but
keith
was
getting
into
the
saddle
and
did
not
appear
to
remember
she
was
there
the
fingers
that
were
tying
her
under
her
chin
fumbled
awkwardly
and
trembled
beatrice
would
have
given
a
good
deal
at
that
moment
to
know
just
what
keith
cameron
was
thinking
and
she
was
in
a
blind
rage
with
herself
to
think
that
it
mattered
to
her
what
he
thought
when
he
lifted
his
hat
she
only
nodded
curtly
she
mimicked
every
beast
and
bird
she
could
think
of
on
the
way
home
to
wipe
him
and
his
horse
from
the
memory
of
dorman
whose
capacity
for
telling
things
best
left
untold
was
simply
marvelous
it
is
saying
much
for
beatrice
powers
of
entertainment
that
dorman
quite
forgot
to
say
anything
about
cameron
and
his
pony
and
chattered
to
his
auntie
and
grandmama
about
kitties
up
in
a
tree
and
lost
lambs
and
sleepy
birds
until
he
was
tucked
into
bed
that
night
it
was
not
until
then
that
beatrice
felt
justified
in
drawing
a
long
breath
not
that
she
cared
whether
any
one
knew
of
her
meeting
keith
cameron
only
that
her
mother
would
instantly
take
alarm
and
preach
to
her
about
the
wickedness
of
flirting
and
beatrice
was
not
in
the
mood
for
sermons
chapter
what
it
meant
to
keith
dick
i
wish
you
tell
me
about
this
leasing
business
there
are
points
which
i
do
beatrice
leaned
over
and
smoothed
rex
sleek
shoulder
with
her
hand
what
do
you
want
to
understand
it
for
the
thing
is
done
now
we
got
the
strung
and
a
crew
hired
to
set
you
need
snap
your
words
like
that
dick
it
does
matter
only
i
was
wondering
why
cameron
acted
so
queer
yesterday
when
i
told
him
about
you
told
keith
what
did
he
say
he
did
say
anything
he
just
looked
where
did
you
see
him
dick
wanted
to
know
well
dear
me
i
do
see
that
it
matters
where
i
saw
him
getting
as
inquisitive
as
mama
if
you
think
it
concerns
you
why
i
met
him
accidentally
when
i
was
fishing
with
dorman
he
was
coming
to
see
you
but
you
were
gone
so
he
stopped
and
talked
for
a
few
minutes
was
there
anything
so
strange
about
that
and
i
told
him
you
were
leasing
the
pine
ridge
country
and
he
looked
well
peculiar
but
he
say
well
he
had
good
reason
for
looking
peculiar
but
you
need
have
told
him
i
did
it
trix
lay
that
at
milord
door
where
it
belongs
i
do
want
keith
to
blame
but
why
should
he
blame
anybody
it
is
his
land
is
it
no
it
is
but
you
see
trix
it
this
way
a
man
goes
somewhere
and
buys
a
ranch
or
locates
on
a
claim
and
starts
into
the
cattle
business
he
may
not
own
more
than
a
few
hundred
acres
of
land
but
if
he
has
much
stock
he
needs
miles
of
prairie
country
with
water
for
them
to
range
on
it
an
absolute
necessity
you
see
he
takes
care
to
locate
where
there
is
plenty
of
public
land
that
is
free
to
cattle
take
the
pool
outfit
for
instance
we
do
own
land
enough
to
feed
of
our
cattle
we
depend
on
government
land
for
range
for
them
the
cross
outfit
is
the
same
only
keith
is
on
a
smaller
scale
he
got
to
have
range
outside
his
own
land
which
is
mostly
hay
land
this
part
of
the
state
is
getting
pretty
well
settled
up
with
small
ranchers
and
then
the
sheep
men
keep
crowding
in
wherever
they
can
get
a
show
and
sheep
will
starve
cattle
to
death
they
leave
a
range
as
bare
as
a
town
so
there
only
one
good
bit
of
range
left
around
here
and
that
the
pine
ridge
country
as
it
called
our
main
dependence
for
winter
range
and
now
when
this
drought
has
struck
us
and
everything
is
drying
up
we
had
to
turn
all
our
cattle
down
there
on
account
of
water
ever
since
i
took
charge
of
the
pool
keith
and
i
threw
in
together
and
used
the
same
range
worked
our
crews
together
and
fought
the
sheepmen
together
there
was
a
time
when
they
tried
to
gobble
the
pine
ridge
range
but
it
did
go
keith
and
i
made
up
our
minds
that
we
needed
it
worse
than
they
did
and
we
got
it
our
punchers
had
every
sheep
herder
bluffed
out
till
there
was
a
could
keep
a
bunch
of
sheep
on
that
range
now
this
lease
law
was
made
by
stockmen
for
stockmen
they
can
lease
land
from
the
government
fence
it
and
they
got
a
cinch
on
it
as
long
as
the
lease
lasts
a
cow
outfit
can
corral
a
heap
of
range
that
way
there
the
trick
of
leasing
every
other
section
or
so
and
then
running
a
fence
around
the
whole
chunk
and
that
what
the
pool
has
done
to
the
pine
ridge
but
you
must
repeat
that
trix
milord
was
long
getting
on
to
the
leasing
graft
in
fact
it
turns
out
the
company
got
wind
of
it
over
in
england
and
sent
him
over
here
to
see
what
could
be
done
in
that
line
he
done
it
all
right
enough
and
there
the
cross
outfit
frozen
out
completely
the
lord
only
knows
what
keith
will
do
with
his
cattle
now
for
we
have
every
drop
of
water
under
fence
inside
of
a
month
he
in
a
hole
for
sure
i
expect
he
feels
pretty
sore
with
me
too
but
i
could
help
it
i
explained
how
it
was
to
milord
but
you
ca
persuade
an
englishman
any
more
than
you
can
a
i
think
put
in
beatrice
firmly
sir
redmond
did
quite
right
it
is
his
fault
that
cameron
owns
more
cattle
than
he
can
feed
if
he
was
sent
over
here
to
lease
the
land
it
was
his
duty
to
do
so
still
i
really
am
sorry
for
keith
wo
sit
down
and
take
his
medicine
if
he
can
help
it
dick
said
moodily
he
could
sell
out
but
i
do
believe
he
will
he
more
apt
to
i
ca
see
how
fighting
will
help
him
beatrice
returned
spiritedly
well
there
one
thing
retorted
dick
if
milord
wants
that
fence
to
stand
he
better
stay
and
watch
it
i
bet
money
he
wo
more
than
strike
liverpool
till
about
forty
miles
more
or
less
of
pool
fence
will
need
repairs
mighty
bad
which
it
wo
get
so
far
as
do
you
mean
that
keith
cameron
would
destroy
our
fencing
dick
grinned
he
be
a
fool
if
he
do
trix
you
can
tell
milord
he
better
send
for
all
his
traps
and
camp
right
here
till
that
lease
runs
out
my
punchers
will
have
something
to
do
beside
ride
i
shall
certainly
tell
sir
redmond
beatrice
threatened
you
and
cameron
hate
him
just
because
he
english
you
wo
see
what
a
splendid
fellow
he
is
it
your
duty
to
stand
by
him
in
this
business
instead
of
taking
sides
with
keith
cameron
why
did
he
lease
that
land
himself
if
he
wanted
to
because
he
plays
meaning
i
suppose
that
sir
redmond
does
i
did
think
you
would
be
so
unjust
sir
redmond
is
a
perfect
well
you
got
a
chance
to
marry
your
gentleman
dick
retorted
savagely
it
a
wonder
you
do
take
him
if
you
think
so
highly
of
i
probably
shall
at
any
rate
he
is
a
male
you
do
seem
to
fancy
a
fellow
that
can
give
you
as
good
as
you
send
dick
rejoined
i
thought
you
would
find
keith
such
easy
game
even
if
he
does
live
on
a
cattle
ranch
you
ca
rope
him
into
making
a
fool
of
himself
for
your
amusement
and
i
glad
of
do
do
your
shouting
too
soon
if
you
could
overhear
some
of
the
things
he
says
you
would
be
so
sure
i
suppose
you
take
them
all
for
their
face
value
grinned
dick
ironically
no
i
do
i
not
a
simple
country
girl
let
me
remind
you
since
you
are
so
sure
of
him
i
have
the
pleasure
of
saying
thank
you
sir
to
your
keith
cameron
just
to
convince
you
i
oh
you
will
well
you
just
tell
me
when
you
do
trix
and
i
give
you
your
pick
of
all
the
saddle
horses
on
the
i
take
rex
and
you
may
as
well
consider
him
mine
oh
you
men
a
few
smiles
judiciously
dispensed
and
beatrice
smiled
most
exasperatingly
at
her
brother
and
dick
went
moody
and
was
very
poor
company
the
rest
of
the
way
home
chapter
pine
ridge
range
ablaze
at
dusk
that
night
a
glow
was
in
the
southern
sky
and
the
wind
carried
the
pungent
odor
of
burning
grass
dick
went
out
on
the
porch
after
dinner
and
sniffed
the
air
uneasily
i
do
much
like
the
look
of
it
he
admitted
to
sir
redmond
it
smells
pretty
strong
to
be
across
the
river
i
sent
a
couple
of
the
boys
out
to
look
a
while
ago
if
it
this
side
of
the
river
we
have
to
get
a
move
it
will
be
the
range
land
i
take
it
if
it
on
this
side
sir
redmond
remarked
just
then
a
man
thundered
through
the
lane
and
up
to
the
very
steps
of
the
porch
and
when
he
stopped
the
horse
he
was
riding
leaned
forward
and
his
legs
shook
with
exhaustion
the
pine
ridge
range
is
afire
lansell
the
man
announced
quietly
dick
took
a
long
pull
at
his
cigar
and
threw
it
away
have
the
boys
throw
some
barrels
and
sacks
into
a
wagon
and
git
he
went
inside
and
grabbed
his
hat
and
when
he
turned
sir
redmond
was
at
his
elbow
i
going
too
dick
cried
beatrice
who
always
seemed
to
hear
anything
that
promised
excitement
i
never
saw
a
in
my
it
ten
miles
off
said
dick
shortly
taking
the
steps
at
a
jump
i
do
care
if
it
twenty
i
going
sir
redmond
wait
for
me
cried
her
mother
detainingly
but
beatrice
was
gone
to
get
ready
a
quick
job
she
made
of
it
she
threw
a
dark
skirt
over
her
thin
white
one
slipped
into
the
nearest
jacket
snatched
her
off
a
chair
where
she
had
thrown
them
and
then
could
find
her
hat
that
however
did
not
trouble
her
down
in
the
hall
she
appropriated
one
of
dick
off
the
hall
tree
and
announced
herself
ready
sir
redmond
laughed
caught
her
hand
and
they
raced
together
down
to
the
stables
before
her
mother
had
fully
grasped
the
situation
is
rex
saddled
dick
dick
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
stopped
long
enough
to
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
her
you
ready
so
soon
jim
saddle
rex
for
miss
he
swung
up
into
the
saddle
are
you
going
to
wait
dick
ca
milord
can
bring
and
dick
was
away
on
the
run
men
were
hurrying
here
and
there
every
move
counting
something
done
while
she
stood
there
a
wagon
rattled
out
from
the
shadow
of
a
haystack
with
empty
dancing
a
mad
jig
behind
the
high
seat
where
the
driver
perched
with
feet
braced
and
a
whip
in
his
hand
after
him
dashed
four
or
five
riders
silent
and
businesslike
in
a
moment
they
were
mere
fantastic
shadows
galloping
up
the
hill
through
the
smothery
gloom
then
came
jim
leading
rex
and
a
horse
for
himself
sir
redmond
had
saddled
his
gray
and
was
waiting
beatrice
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
took
the
lead
with
nerves
the
wind
that
rushed
against
her
face
was
hot
and
reeking
with
smoke
her
nostrils
drank
greedily
the
tang
it
carried
you
gipsy
cried
sir
redmond
peering
at
her
through
the
murky
gloom
this
is
living
she
laughed
and
urged
rex
faster
so
they
raced
recklessly
over
the
hills
toward
where
the
night
was
aglow
before
them
the
wagon
pounded
over
untrailed
prairie
sod
with
shadowy
figures
fleeing
always
before
here
wild
cattle
rushed
off
at
either
side
to
stop
and
eye
them
curiously
as
they
whirled
past
there
a
coyote
squatting
unseen
upon
a
distant
pinnacle
howled
and
quavering
his
weird
protest
against
the
solitudes
in
which
he
wandered
the
dusk
deepened
to
dark
and
they
could
no
longer
see
the
racing
shadows
the
rattle
of
the
wagon
came
mysteriously
back
to
them
through
the
black
once
rex
stumbled
over
a
rock
and
came
near
falling
but
beatrice
only
laughed
and
urged
him
on
unheeding
sir
redmond
call
to
ride
slower
they
splashed
through
a
shallow
creek
and
came
upon
the
wagon
halted
that
the
cowboys
might
fill
the
barrels
with
water
then
they
passed
by
and
when
they
heard
them
following
the
wagon
no
longer
rattled
glibly
along
but
chuckled
heavily
under
its
load
the
dull
red
glow
brightened
to
orange
then
breasting
at
last
a
long
hill
they
came
to
the
top
and
beatrice
caught
her
breath
at
what
lay
below
a
jagged
line
of
leaping
flame
cut
clean
through
the
dark
of
the
coulee
the
smoke
piled
rosily
above
and
before
and
the
sullen
roar
of
it
clutched
the
senses
challenging
sinister
creeping
stealthily
relentlessly
here
a
thin
gash
of
yellow
hugging
close
to
the
earth
there
a
bold
bright
wall
of
fire
it
swept
the
coulee
from
rim
to
rim
the
wind
is
carrying
it
from
us
sir
redmond
was
saying
in
her
ear
are
you
afraid
to
stop
here
alone
i
ought
to
go
down
and
lend
a
beatrice
drew
a
long
gasp
oh
no
i
not
afraid
go
there
is
dick
down
you
sure
you
wo
mind
he
hesitated
dreading
to
leave
her
no
no
go
on
they
need
sir
redmond
turned
and
rode
down
the
ridge
toward
the
flames
his
straight
figure
was
silhouetted
sharply
against
the
glow
beatrice
slipped
off
her
horse
and
sat
down
upon
a
rock
dead
to
everything
but
the
fiendish
beauty
of
the
scene
spread
out
below
her
millions
of
sparks
danced
in
and
out
among
the
smoke
wreaths
which
curled
upward
now
black
now
red
now
a
dainty
rose
off
to
the
left
a
coyote
yapped
shrilly
ending
with
his
mournful
howl
beatrice
shivered
from
sheer
ecstasy
this
was
a
world
she
had
never
before
seen
a
world
of
hot
wind
of
shadows
and
light
of
roar
and
hoarse
bellowing
and
sharp
crackles
of
calm
sky
above
and
in
the
distance
the
uncanny
howling
of
a
coyote
time
had
no
reckoning
there
she
saw
men
running
to
and
fro
in
the
glare
disappearing
in
a
downward
swirl
of
smoke
coming
to
view
again
in
the
open
beyond
always
their
arms
waved
rhythmically
downward
beating
the
ragged
line
of
yellow
with
sacks
the
trail
they
left
was
a
wavering
rim
of
sullen
black
where
before
had
been
gay
dancing
orange
light
in
places
the
smolder
fanned
to
new
life
behind
them
and
licked
greedily
at
the
ripe
grass
like
hungry
red
tongues
one
of
these
beatrice
watched
curiously
it
crept
slyly
into
an
unburned
hollow
and
the
wind
veering
suddenly
pushed
it
out
of
sight
from
the
fighters
and
sent
it
racing
merrily
to
the
south
the
main
line
of
fire
beat
doggedly
up
against
the
wind
that
a
minute
before
had
been
friendly
and
fought
bravely
two
foes
instead
of
one
it
dodged
ducked
and
leaped
high
and
the
men
beat
upon
it
mercilessly
but
the
little
new
flame
broadened
and
stood
on
tiptoes
defiantly
proud
of
the
wide
black
trail
that
kept
stretching
away
behind
it
and
beatrice
watched
it
fascinated
by
its
miraculous
growth
it
began
to
crackle
and
send
up
smoke
wreaths
of
its
own
with
sparks
dancing
through
then
its
voice
deepened
and
coarsened
till
it
roared
quite
like
its
mother
around
the
hill
the
smoke
from
the
larger
fire
rolled
back
with
the
wind
and
beatrice
felt
her
eyes
sting
flakes
of
blackened
grass
and
ashes
rained
upon
the
hilltop
and
rex
moved
uneasily
and
pawed
at
the
dry
sod
to
him
a
was
not
beautiful
it
was
an
enemy
to
run
from
he
twitched
his
reins
from
beatrice
heedless
fingers
and
decamped
toward
home
paying
no
attention
whatever
to
the
command
of
his
mistress
to
stop
still
beatrice
sat
and
watched
the
new
fire
and
was
glad
she
chanced
to
be
upon
the
south
end
of
a
hill
so
that
she
could
see
both
ways
the
blaze
dove
into
a
deep
hollow
climbed
the
slope
beyond
leaped
exultantly
and
bellowed
its
challenge
and
of
a
sudden
dark
forms
sprang
upon
it
and
beat
it
cruelly
and
it
went
black
where
they
struck
and
only
thin
streamers
of
smoke
told
where
it
had
been
still
they
beat
and
struck
and
struck
again
till
the
fire
died
ingloriously
and
the
hillside
to
the
south
lay
dark
and
still
as
it
had
been
at
the
beginning
beatrice
wondered
who
had
done
it
then
she
came
back
to
her
surroundings
and
realized
that
rex
had
left
her
and
she
was
alone
she
shivered
this
time
not
in
ecstasy
but
partly
from
loneliness
and
went
down
the
hill
toward
where
dick
and
sir
redmond
and
the
others
were
fighting
steadily
the
larger
fire
unconscious
of
the
younger
new
one
that
had
stolen
away
from
them
and
was
beaten
to
death
around
the
hill
once
in
the
coulee
she
was
compelled
to
take
to
the
burnt
ground
which
crisped
hotly
under
her
feet
and
sent
up
a
rank
suffocating
smell
of
burned
grass
into
her
nostrils
the
whole
country
was
alight
and
down
there
the
world
seemed
on
fire
at
times
the
smoke
swooped
blindingly
and
half
strangled
her
her
skirts
in
passing
swept
the
black
ashes
from
grass
roots
which
showed
red
in
the
night
picking
her
way
carefully
around
the
spots
that
glowed
warningly
shielding
her
face
as
well
as
she
could
from
the
smoke
she
kept
on
until
she
was
close
upon
the
fighters
dick
and
sir
redmond
were
working
side
by
side
the
sacks
they
held
rising
and
falling
with
the
regularity
of
a
machine
for
minutes
at
a
time
a
group
of
strange
horsemen
galloped
up
from
the
way
she
had
come
followed
by
a
wagon
of
careering
recklessly
over
the
uneven
ground
the
horsemen
stopped
just
inside
the
burned
rim
the
horses
sidestepping
gingerly
upon
the
hot
turf
i
guess
you
want
some
help
here
where
shall
we
start
in
beatrice
recognized
the
voice
it
was
keith
cameron
sure
we
do
dick
answered
gratefully
start
in
any
old
i
not
sure
we
want
your
help
spoke
the
angry
voice
of
sir
redmond
i
take
it
you
already
done
a
devilish
sight
too
what
do
you
mean
by
that
keith
demanded
and
then
by
the
silence
it
seemed
that
every
one
knew
beatrice
caught
her
breath
was
this
one
of
the
ways
dick
meant
that
keith
could
fight
climb
down
boys
and
get
busy
keith
called
to
his
men
after
a
few
breaths
this
is
for
dick
wait
a
minute
pete
drive
the
wagon
ahead
there
i
guess
we
better
begin
on
the
other
end
and
work
this
way
come
on
there
too
much
hot
air
they
clattered
on
across
the
coulee
kicking
hot
ashes
up
for
the
wind
to
seize
upon
beatrice
went
slowly
up
to
dick
feeling
all
at
once
very
tired
and
out
of
heart
with
it
all
dick
she
called
in
an
anxious
little
voice
rex
has
run
away
from
me
what
shall
i
do
dick
straightened
stiffly
his
hands
upon
his
aching
loins
and
peered
through
the
smoke
at
her
i
guess
the
only
thing
to
do
then
is
to
get
into
the
wagon
over
there
you
can
drive
trix
if
you
want
to
and
that
will
give
us
another
man
here
i
was
just
going
to
have
some
one
take
you
home
now
the
lord
only
knows
you
liable
to
have
to
stay
till
morning
rex
will
go
home
all
right
you
need
worry
about
he
bent
to
the
work
again
and
she
could
hear
the
wet
sack
thud
thud
upon
the
ground
other
sacks
and
blankets
went
thud
thud
and
down
here
at
close
range
the
fire
was
not
so
beautiful
as
it
had
been
from
the
hilltop
down
here
the
glamour
was
gone
she
climbed
up
to
the
high
wagon
seat
and
took
the
reins
from
the
man
who
immediately
seized
upon
a
sack
and
went
off
to
the
fight
she
felt
that
she
was
out
of
touch
she
was
out
on
the
prairie
at
night
miles
away
from
any
house
driving
a
for
the
men
to
put
out
a
prairie
fire
she
had
driven
a
once
on
a
wager
but
she
had
never
driven
a
with
barrels
of
water
before
she
could
not
think
of
any
girl
she
knew
who
had
it
was
a
new
experience
certainly
but
she
found
no
pleasure
in
it
she
was
tired
and
sleepy
and
her
eyes
and
throat
smarted
cruelly
with
the
smoke
she
looked
back
to
the
hill
she
had
just
left
and
it
seemed
a
long
long
time
since
she
sat
upon
a
rock
up
there
and
watched
the
little
new
fire
grow
and
grow
and
the
strange
shadows
spring
up
from
nowhere
and
beat
it
vindictively
till
it
died
again
she
wondered
vaguely
who
had
done
it
not
keith
cameron
surely
for
sir
redmond
had
all
but
accused
him
openly
of
setting
the
range
afire
would
he
stamp
out
a
blaze
that
was
just
reaching
a
size
to
do
mischief
if
left
a
little
longer
no
one
would
have
seen
it
for
hours
probably
he
would
undoubtedly
have
let
it
run
unless
but
who
else
could
have
set
the
fire
who
else
would
want
to
see
the
pine
ridge
country
black
and
barren
dick
said
keith
cameron
would
not
sit
down
and
take
his
medicine
perhaps
dick
knew
he
would
do
this
thing
as
the
fighters
moved
on
across
the
coulee
she
drove
the
wagon
to
keep
pace
with
them
often
a
man
would
run
up
to
the
wagon
climb
upon
a
wheel
and
dip
a
frayed
gunny
sack
into
a
barrel
lift
it
out
and
run
with
it
all
dripping
to
the
nearest
point
of
the
fire
her
part
was
to
keep
the
wagon
at
the
most
convenient
place
she
began
to
feel
the
importance
of
her
position
and
to
take
pride
in
being
always
at
the
right
spot
from
the
calm
appreciation
of
the
picturesque
side
she
drifted
to
the
keen
interest
of
the
one
who
battles
against
heavy
odds
the
wind
had
veered
again
and
the
flames
rushed
up
the
long
coulee
like
an
express
train
but
the
path
it
left
was
growing
narrower
every
moment
keith
cameron
was
doing
grand
work
with
his
crew
upon
the
other
side
and
the
space
between
them
was
shortening
perceptibly
beatrice
found
herself
watching
the
work
of
the
cross
men
if
they
were
doing
it
for
effect
they
certainly
were
acting
well
their
part
she
wondered
what
would
happen
when
the
two
crews
met
and
the
danger
was
over
would
sir
redmond
call
keith
cameron
to
account
for
what
he
had
done
if
he
did
what
would
keith
say
and
which
side
would
dick
take
very
likely
she
thought
he
would
defend
keith
cameron
and
shield
him
if
he
could
beatrice
found
herself
crying
quietly
and
shivering
though
the
air
was
sultry
with
the
fire
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
not
tell
why
she
cried
but
she
tried
to
believe
it
was
the
smoke
in
her
eyes
perhaps
it
was
the
sky
was
growing
gray
when
the
two
crews
met
the
orange
lights
were
gone
and
dick
with
a
spiteful
flop
of
the
black
rag
which
had
been
a
good
new
sack
stamped
out
the
last
tiny
red
tongue
of
the
fire
the
men
stood
about
in
awkward
silence
panting
with
heat
and
weariness
sir
redmond
was
ostentatiously
filling
his
pipe
beatrice
knew
him
by
his
straight
soldierly
pose
in
the
drab
they
were
all
mere
black
outlines
of
men
and
for
the
most
part
she
could
not
distinguish
one
from
another
keith
cameron
she
knew
instinctively
by
his
slim
height
and
by
the
way
he
carried
his
head
unconsciously
she
leaned
down
from
the
high
seat
and
listened
for
what
would
come
next
keith
seemed
to
be
making
a
cigarette
a
match
flared
and
lighted
his
face
for
an
instant
then
was
pinched
out
and
he
was
again
only
a
black
shape
in
the
well
i
waiting
for
what
you
got
to
say
sir
his
voice
cut
sharply
through
the
silence
if
he
had
known
beatrice
was
out
there
in
the
wagon
he
would
have
spoken
lower
perhaps
i
fancy
i
said
all
that
is
necessary
just
now
sir
redmond
answered
calmly
you
know
what
i
think
from
now
on
i
shall
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
then
keith
voice
was
clear
and
unperturbed
as
though
he
asked
for
the
sake
of
being
polite
that
retorted
sir
redmond
is
my
own
affair
however
since
the
matter
concerns
you
rather
closely
i
will
say
that
when
i
have
the
evidence
i
am
confident
i
shall
find
i
shall
seek
the
proper
channels
for
retribution
there
are
laws
in
this
country
aimed
to
protect
a
man
property
i
take
it
i
warn
you
that
i
shall
not
spare
the
dick
it
up
to
you
next
i
want
to
know
where
you
at
your
back
keith
right
up
to
the
finish
i
know
you
you
fight
all
right
then
i
did
think
you
go
back
on
a
fellow
and
i
tell
you
straight
up
sir
redmond
hayes
i
not
out
touching
matches
to
range
land
not
if
it
belonged
to
the
devil
himself
i
got
some
feeling
for
the
dumb
brutes
that
would
have
to
suffer
you
can
get
right
to
work
hunting
evidence
and
be
damned
you
dead
welcome
to
all
you
can
find
and
in
this
part
of
the
country
you
wo
be
able
to
buy
much
you
know
very
well
you
deserve
to
get
your
rope
crossed
or
you
be
on
the
lookout
for
trouble
come
boys
let
hit
the
trail
so
long
dick
beatrice
watched
them
troop
off
to
their
horses
heard
them
mount
and
go
tearing
off
across
the
burned
coulee
bottom
toward
home
dick
came
slowly
over
to
her
i
expect
you
good
and
tired
sis
you
made
a
hand
all
right
and
helped
us
a
whole
lot
i
can
tell
you
i
drive
now
and
we
hit
the
high
beatrice
smiled
wanly
not
one
of
her
eastern
acquaintances
would
have
recognized
beatrice
lansell
the
society
beauty
in
this
young
woman
attired
in
a
most
haphazard
fashion
with
a
face
grimed
like
a
chimney
sweep
red
eyelids
drooping
over
tired
smarting
eyes
and
disheveled
hair
topped
by
a
man
gray
felt
hat
when
she
smiled
her
teeth
shone
dead
white
like
a
negro
dick
regarded
her
critically
one
foot
on
the
wheel
hub
where
did
you
get
hold
of
keith
cameron
hat
he
inquired
beatrice
snatched
the
hat
from
her
head
with
childish
petulance
and
looked
as
if
she
were
going
to
throw
it
viciously
upon
the
ground
if
her
face
had
been
clean
dick
might
have
seen
how
the
blood
had
rushed
into
her
cheeks
as
it
was
she
was
safe
behind
a
mask
of
soot
she
placed
the
hat
back
upon
her
head
feeling
privately
a
bit
foolish
i
supposed
it
was
yours
i
took
it
off
the
the
dignity
of
her
tone
was
superb
but
unfortunately
it
did
not
match
her
appearance
of
rakish
vagabondage
dick
grinned
through
a
deep
layer
of
soot
well
it
happens
to
be
keith
he
lost
it
in
the
wind
the
other
day
and
i
found
it
and
took
it
home
it
too
bad
you
worn
his
hat
all
night
and
did
know
it
you
ought
to
see
yourself
your
own
mother
wo
know
you
i
ca
look
any
worse
than
you
do
a
negro
would
be
white
by
comparison
do
get
in
so
we
can
start
i
tired
to
death
and
after
these
unamiable
remarks
she
refused
to
open
her
lips
they
drove
silently
in
the
gray
of
early
morning
and
the
empty
barrels
danced
monotonously
their
fantastic
jig
in
the
back
of
the
wagon
sootyfaced
cowboys
galloped
wearily
over
the
prairie
before
them
and
sir
redmond
rode
moodily
alongside
of
a
truth
the
glamour
was
gone
chapter
sir
redmond
waits
his
answer
beatrice
felt
distinctly
out
of
sorts
the
next
day
and
chose
an
hour
for
her
ride
when
she
felt
reasonably
secure
from
unwelcome
company
but
when
she
went
out
into
the
sunshine
there
was
sir
redmond
waiting
with
rex
and
his
big
gray
beatrice
was
not
exactly
elated
at
the
sight
but
she
saw
nothing
to
do
but
smile
and
make
the
best
of
it
she
wanted
to
be
alone
so
that
she
could
dream
along
through
the
hills
she
had
learned
to
love
and
think
out
some
things
which
troubled
her
and
decide
just
how
she
had
best
go
about
winning
rex
for
herself
it
had
become
quite
necessary
to
her
peace
of
mind
that
she
should
teach
dick
and
keith
cameron
a
lesson
it
has
been
so
long
since
we
rode
together
he
apologized
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
coming
oh
no
why
should
i
mind
beatrice
smiled
upon
him
in
friendly
fashion
she
liked
sir
redmond
very
much
only
she
hoped
he
was
not
going
to
make
love
somehow
she
did
not
feel
in
the
mood
for
just
then
i
do
know
why
i
sure
but
you
seem
rather
fond
of
riding
about
these
hills
by
yourself
one
should
never
ask
why
women
do
things
i
fancy
it
seems
always
to
invite
does
it
beatrice
was
not
they
were
passing
just
then
the
suburbs
of
a
dog
town
and
she
was
never
tired
of
watching
the
stand
upon
their
burrows
defiance
until
fear
overtook
their
impertinence
and
then
dive
headlong
deep
into
the
earth
i
do
think
a
is
the
most
impudent
creature
alive
and
the
most
shrewish
i
never
pass
but
i
am
scolded
by
these
little
scoundrels
till
my
ears
burn
what
do
you
think
they
say
they
probably
inviting
you
to
stop
with
them
and
be
their
queen
and
are
scolding
because
your
heart
is
hard
and
you
only
laugh
and
ride
queen
of
a
town
dear
me
why
this
plaintive
mood
am
i
plaintive
i
do
not
mean
to
be
i
you
do
appear
exactly
hilarious
she
told
him
i
ca
see
what
is
getting
the
matter
with
us
all
mama
and
your
sister
are
poor
company
even
for
each
other
and
dick
is
like
a
bear
one
ca
get
a
civil
word
out
of
him
i
not
exactly
amiable
myself
either
but
i
relied
upon
you
to
keep
the
mental
temperature
up
to
normal
sir
perhaps
it
a
good
thing
we
shall
not
stop
here
much
longer
i
must
confess
i
do
fancy
the
country
and
mary
is
downright
homesick
she
wants
to
get
back
to
her
parish
affairs
she
afraid
some
rheumatic
old
woman
needs
coddling
with
jelly
and
wine
and
that
sort
of
thing
promised
to
hurry
through
the
business
here
and
take
her
home
but
i
mean
to
see
that
pine
ridge
fence
in
place
before
i
go
or
at
least
see
it
well
under
i
sure
dick
will
attend
to
it
properly
beatrice
remarked
with
pink
cheeks
if
she
remembered
what
she
had
threatened
to
tell
sir
redmond
she
certainly
could
not
have
asked
for
a
better
opportunity
she
was
reminding
herself
at
that
moment
that
she
always
detested
a
tale
bearer
your
brother
dick
is
a
fine
fellow
and
i
have
every
confidence
in
him
but
you
must
see
yourself
that
he
is
swayed
more
or
less
by
his
friendship
for
his
neighbors
it
is
only
a
kindness
to
take
the
responsibility
off
his
shoulders
till
the
thing
is
done
i
sure
he
will
feel
better
to
have
it
yes
she
agreed
i
think
you
right
dick
always
was
very
and
right
or
wrong
he
clings
to
his
then
rather
hastily
as
though
anxious
to
change
the
trend
of
the
conversation
of
course
your
sister
will
insist
on
keeping
dorman
with
her
i
shall
miss
that
little
scamp
dreadfully
i
the
next
minute
she
saw
that
she
had
only
opened
a
subject
she
dreaded
even
more
it
is
something
to
know
that
there
is
even
one
of
us
that
you
will
miss
sir
redmond
observed
something
in
his
tone
hurt
i
shall
miss
you
all
she
said
hastily
it
has
been
a
delightful
i
wish
i
might
know
just
what
element
made
it
delightful
i
wish
i
scarcely
think
it
has
been
any
particular
element
she
broke
in
trying
desperately
to
stave
off
what
she
felt
in
his
tone
i
love
the
wild
where
i
can
ride
and
ride
and
never
meet
a
human
being
where
i
can
dream
and
dally
and
feast
my
eyes
on
a
landscape
man
has
not
touched
i
have
lived
most
of
my
life
in
new
york
and
i
love
nature
so
well
that
i
inclined
to
be
jealous
of
her
i
want
her
left
free
to
work
out
all
her
whims
in
her
own
way
she
has
a
keen
sense
of
humor
i
think
the
way
she
modeled
some
of
these
hills
proves
that
she
loves
her
little
jokes
i
have
seen
where
she
cut
deep
fearsome
gashes
with
sides
precipitous
as
though
she
had
some
priceless
treasure
hidden
away
in
the
deep
where
man
can
not
despoil
it
and
if
you
plot
and
plan
and
try
very
hard
you
may
reach
the
bottom
at
last
and
find
the
treasure
nothing
or
perhaps
a
tiny
little
stream
as
jealously
guarded
as
though
each
drop
were
sir
richmond
rode
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
when
he
spoke
it
was
abruptly
and
is
that
all
is
there
nothing
to
this
delightful
summer
after
all
but
your
hills
oh
of
course
i
it
has
all
been
delightful
i
shall
hate
to
go
back
home
i
beatrice
was
a
bit
startled
to
find
just
how
much
she
would
hate
to
go
back
and
wrap
herself
once
more
in
the
conventions
of
society
life
for
the
first
time
since
she
could
remember
she
wanted
her
world
to
stand
still
sir
redmond
went
doggedly
to
the
point
he
had
in
mind
and
heart
i
hoped
beatrice
you
would
count
me
too
i
tried
to
be
patient
you
know
do
you
that
i
love
you
you
certainly
told
me
often
enough
she
retorted
in
a
miserable
attempt
at
her
old
manner
and
you
put
me
off
and
laughed
at
me
and
did
everything
under
heaven
but
answer
me
fairly
and
i
acted
the
fool
no
doubt
i
know
it
i
no
courage
before
a
woman
a
curl
of
your
lip
and
i
was
ready
to
cut
and
run
but
i
ca
go
on
this
way
forever
i
got
to
know
i
wish
i
could
talk
as
easy
as
i
can
fight
i
have
settled
the
thing
long
ago
where
other
men
can
plead
their
cause
i
can
say
just
the
one
thing
i
love
you
beatrice
when
i
saw
you
first
in
the
carriage
i
loved
you
then
you
had
some
fur
brown
fur
snuggled
under
your
chin
and
the
pink
of
your
cheeks
and
your
dear
brown
eyes
shining
and
smiling
above
good
god
i
always
loved
you
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
i
think
i
be
good
to
you
beatrice
and
i
believe
i
could
make
you
happy
if
you
give
me
the
something
in
beatrice
throat
ached
cruelly
it
was
the
truth
and
she
knew
it
he
did
love
her
and
the
love
of
a
brave
man
is
not
a
thing
to
be
thrust
lightly
aside
but
it
demanded
such
a
lot
in
return
more
perhaps
than
she
could
give
a
love
like
that
a
love
that
gives
everything
demands
everything
in
return
anything
less
insults
it
she
stole
a
glance
at
him
sir
redmond
was
looking
straight
before
him
with
the
fixed
gaze
that
sees
nothing
there
was
the
white
line
around
his
mouth
which
beatrice
had
seen
once
before
again
that
griping
ache
was
in
her
throat
till
she
could
have
cried
out
with
the
pain
of
it
she
wanted
to
speak
to
say
something
anything
which
would
drive
that
look
from
his
face
while
her
mind
groped
among
the
jumble
of
words
that
danced
upon
her
tongue
and
that
seemed
all
of
them
so
pitifully
weak
and
inadequate
she
heard
the
galloping
hoofs
of
a
horse
pounding
close
behind
a
choking
cloud
of
dust
swept
down
upon
them
and
keith
riding
in
the
midst
reined
out
to
pass
he
lifted
his
hat
his
eyes
challenged
beatrice
swept
coldly
the
face
of
her
companion
and
turned
again
to
the
trail
he
swung
his
heels
backward
and
redcloud
broke
again
into
the
tireless
lope
that
carried
him
far
ahead
until
there
was
only
a
brown
dot
speeding
over
the
prairie
sir
redmond
waited
until
keith
was
far
beyond
hearing
then
he
filled
his
lungs
deeply
and
looked
at
beatrice
do
you
feel
you
could
trust
me
and
love
me
a
little
beatrice
was
deadly
afraid
she
was
going
to
cry
and
she
hated
weeping
women
above
all
things
a
little
would
do
she
said
with
what
firmness
she
could
muster
i
should
want
to
love
you
as
much
quite
as
much
as
you
deserve
sir
redmond
or
not
at
all
i
afraid
i
ca
i
wish
i
could
though
i
i
think
i
should
like
to
love
you
but
perhaps
i
have
much
heart
i
like
you
very
much
better
than
i
ever
liked
any
one
before
but
oh
i
wish
you
would
insist
on
an
answer
i
know
myself
how
i
feel
i
wish
you
had
not
asked
me
yet
i
tried
not
to
let
a
man
can
keep
his
heart
still
for
a
certain
time
beatrice
but
not
for
always
some
time
he
will
say
what
his
heart
commands
if
the
chance
is
given
him
the
woman
ca
hold
him
back
i
did
wait
and
wait
because
i
thought
you
were
ready
for
me
to
speak
and
you
do
care
for
anybody
else
of
course
i
do
but
i
hate
to
give
up
my
freedom
to
any
one
sir
redmond
i
want
to
be
free
free
as
the
wind
that
blows
here
always
and
changes
and
changes
and
blows
from
any
point
that
suits
its
whim
without
being
bound
to
any
do
you
think
i
an
ogre
that
will
lock
you
in
a
dungeon
beatrice
ca
you
see
that
i
am
not
threatening
your
freedom
i
only
want
the
right
to
love
you
and
make
you
happy
i
should
not
ask
you
to
go
or
stay
where
you
did
not
please
and
i
be
good
to
you
beatrice
i
do
think
it
would
matter
cried
beatrice
if
you
were
i
should
love
you
because
i
could
help
myself
i
hate
doing
things
by
rule
i
tell
you
i
could
care
for
you
because
you
were
good
to
me
and
i
ought
to
care
it
must
be
because
i
ca
help
myself
and
i
she
stopped
and
shut
her
teeth
hard
together
she
felt
sure
she
should
cry
in
another
minute
if
this
went
on
i
believe
you
do
love
me
beatrice
and
your
rebellious
young
american
nature
dreads
he
tried
to
look
into
her
eyes
and
smile
but
she
kept
her
eyes
looking
straight
ahead
then
sir
redmond
made
the
biggest
blunder
of
his
life
out
of
the
goodness
of
his
heart
and
because
he
hated
to
tease
her
into
promising
anything
i
wo
ask
you
to
tell
me
now
beatrice
he
said
gently
i
want
you
to
be
sure
i
never
could
forgive
myself
if
you
ever
felt
you
had
made
a
mistake
a
week
from
i
shall
ask
you
once
more
and
it
will
be
for
the
last
time
after
that
but
i
wo
think
i
dare
think
what
it
would
be
like
if
you
say
no
will
you
tell
me
then
beatrice
the
heart
of
beatrice
jumped
into
her
throat
at
that
minute
she
was
very
near
to
saying
yes
and
having
done
with
it
she
was
quite
sure
she
knew
then
what
her
answer
would
be
in
a
week
the
smile
she
gave
him
started
sir
redmond
blood
to
racing
exultantly
her
lips
parted
a
little
as
if
a
word
were
there
ready
to
be
spoken
but
she
caught
herself
back
from
the
decision
sir
redmond
had
voluntarily
given
her
a
week
well
then
she
would
take
it
to
the
last
minute
yes
i
tell
you
a
week
from
after
dinner
i
race
you
home
sir
redmond
the
first
one
through
the
big
gate
by
the
stable
wins
she
struck
rex
a
blow
that
made
him
jump
and
darted
off
down
the
trail
that
led
home
and
her
teasing
laugh
was
the
last
sir
redmond
heard
of
her
that
day
for
she
whipped
into
a
narrow
gulch
when
the
first
turn
hid
her
from
him
and
waited
until
he
had
thundered
by
after
that
she
rode
complacently
deep
into
the
hills
wickedly
pleased
at
the
trick
she
had
played
him
every
day
during
the
week
that
followed
she
slipped
away
from
him
and
rode
away
by
herself
resolved
to
enjoy
her
freedom
to
the
full
while
she
had
it
for
after
that
she
felt
things
would
never
be
quite
the
same
every
day
when
dick
had
chance
for
a
quiet
word
with
her
he
wanted
to
know
who
owned
rex
till
at
last
she
lost
her
temper
and
told
him
plainly
that
in
her
opinion
keith
cameron
had
left
the
country
for
two
reasons
instead
of
one
for
keith
be
it
known
had
not
been
seen
since
the
day
he
passed
her
and
sir
redmond
on
the
trail
beatrice
averred
that
she
had
a
poor
opinion
of
a
man
who
would
not
stay
and
face
whatever
was
coming
there
was
just
one
day
left
in
her
week
of
freedom
and
dick
still
owned
rex
with
the
chances
all
in
his
favor
for
continuing
to
do
so
still
beatrice
was
vindictively
determined
upon
one
point
let
keith
cameron
cross
her
path
and
she
would
do
something
she
had
never
done
before
she
would
deliberately
lead
him
on
to
propose
if
the
fellow
had
nerve
enough
to
do
so
which
she
told
dick
she
doubted
chapter
held
up
by
kelly
what
lies
over
the
hill
questioned
a
mischievous
voice
keith
dreaming
along
a
winding
trail
in
the
canyon
looked
up
quickly
and
beheld
his
heart
desire
sitting
calmly
upon
her
horse
ten
feet
before
redcloud
nose
watching
him
amusedly
redcloud
must
have
been
dreaming
also
or
he
would
have
whinnied
warning
and
welcome
with
the
same
breath
tell
to
me
she
went
on
seeing
keith
only
stared
keith
not
to
be
outdone
searched
his
memory
hurriedly
for
the
reply
which
should
rightly
follow
secretly
he
was
amazed
at
her
sudden
friendliness
there
a
valley
over
there
but
it
is
and
wooded
and
shy
not
what
you
can
notice
and
there
is
any
town
either
unless
you
go
a
long
way
why
keith
rested
his
gloved
hands
one
above
the
other
on
the
saddle
horn
and
let
his
eyes
riot
with
the
love
that
was
in
him
he
had
not
seen
his
heart
desire
for
a
week
a
week
it
seemed
a
thousand
years
and
here
she
was
before
him
unusually
gracious
why
i
discovered
that
hill
two
hours
ago
it
seems
to
me
and
it
was
more
than
a
mile
off
i
want
to
see
what
lies
on
the
other
side
i
feel
sure
no
man
ever
stood
upon
the
top
and
looked
down
it
is
my
hill
mine
by
the
right
of
discovery
but
i
been
going
and
going
and
i
think
it
rather
farther
away
if
anything
than
it
was
good
thing
i
met
you
keith
declared
and
he
looked
as
if
he
meant
it
you
probably
lost
right
now
and
do
know
it
which
way
is
home
beatrice
smiled
a
superior
smile
and
pointed
i
thought
so
grinned
keith
joyously
you
pointing
straight
toward
it
does
matter
said
beatrice
since
you
know
and
you
here
the
important
thing
is
to
get
to
the
top
of
that
what
for
keith
questioned
why
to
be
there
beatrice
opened
her
big
eyes
at
him
that
she
declared
whimsically
is
the
top
of
the
world
and
it
is
mine
i
found
it
i
want
to
go
up
there
and
look
it
an
unmerciful
climb
keith
demurred
hypocritically
to
strengthen
her
resolution
all
the
better
i
do
value
what
comes
you
wo
see
anything
except
more
i
love
hills
and
more
you
a
long
way
from
home
and
it
after
one
i
have
a
lunch
with
me
and
i
often
stay
out
until
dinner
keith
gave
a
sigh
that
shook
the
saddle
making
up
in
volume
what
it
lacked
in
sincerity
the
blood
in
him
was
at
the
prospect
of
leading
his
heart
desire
up
next
the
clouds
up
where
the
world
was
yet
young
a
man
in
love
is
fond
of
i
have
not
said
you
must
beatrice
answered
with
the
sigh
you
do
have
to
he
retorted
it
is
a
self
evident
fact
who
wants
to
go
prowling
around
these
hills
by
night
with
a
lantern
that
smokes
an
has
an
evil
smell
losing
sleep
and
yowling
like
a
bunch
of
coyotes
hunting
a
misguided
young
woman
who
thinks
north
is
south
and
point
straight
up
you
draw
a
flattering
picture
it
realistic
do
you
still
insist
upon
getting
up
there
for
the
doubtful
pleasure
of
looking
down
secretly
he
hoped
so
then
i
shall
go
with
you
need
not
i
can
go
very
well
by
myself
beatrice
was
something
of
a
hypocrite
herself
i
shall
go
where
duty
points
the
i
hope
it
points
toward
home
it
does
though
it
takes
the
trail
you
i
never
yet
allowed
my
wishes
to
masquerade
as
disagreeable
duty
with
two
big
d
she
told
him
tartly
and
started
off
say
if
you
going
up
that
hill
this
is
the
trail
you
bump
up
against
a
straight
cliff
if
you
follow
that
beatrice
turned
with
seeming
reluctance
and
allowed
him
to
guide
her
just
as
she
had
intended
he
should
do
dick
tells
me
you
have
been
away
she
began
suavely
yes
i
just
got
back
from
fort
belknap
he
explained
quietly
though
he
must
have
known
his
absence
had
been
construed
differently
i
rented
pasturage
on
the
reservation
for
every
hoof
i
own
great
grass
over
there
the
whole
prairie
like
a
hay
meadow
almost
and
little
streams
you
are
very
fortunate
beatrice
remarked
politely
luck
ought
to
come
my
way
once
in
a
while
i
do
seem
to
get
more
than
my
share
dick
will
be
glad
to
know
you
have
a
good
range
for
your
cattle
i
expect
he
will
you
may
tell
him
for
me
that
jim
worthington
the
agent
over
there
and
was
in
college
with
us
says
i
can
have
my
cattle
there
as
long
as
he
running
the
why
not
tell
him
yourself
beatrice
asked
i
do
expect
to
be
over
to
the
pool
ranch
for
a
keith
tone
was
significant
and
beatrice
dropped
the
subject
been
fishing
lately
he
asked
easily
as
though
he
had
not
left
her
that
day
in
a
miff
no
dorman
is
fickle
like
all
male
creatures
dick
brought
him
two
little
brown
puppies
the
other
day
and
now
he
can
hardly
be
dragged
from
the
woodshed
to
his
meals
i
believe
he
would
eat
and
sleep
with
them
if
his
auntie
would
allow
him
the
trail
narrowed
there
and
they
were
obliged
to
ride
single
file
which
was
not
favorable
to
conversation
thus
far
beatrice
thought
she
was
a
long
way
from
winning
her
wager
but
she
did
not
worry
she
looked
up
to
where
the
hill
towered
above
them
and
smiled
we
have
to
get
off
and
lead
our
horses
over
this
spur
he
told
her
at
last
once
on
the
other
side
we
can
begin
to
climb
still
in
the
humor
to
tackle
it
to
be
sure
i
am
after
all
this
trouble
i
shall
not
turn
all
right
said
keith
inwardly
shouting
if
his
heart
desire
wished
to
take
a
climb
that
would
last
a
good
two
hours
he
was
not
there
to
object
he
led
her
up
a
steep
ridge
and
into
a
hollow
from
there
the
hill
sloped
smoothly
upward
i
just
anchor
these
cayuses
to
a
rock
to
make
of
them
keith
remarked
it
would
be
fun
to
be
set
afoot
out
here
now
would
it
how
would
you
like
the
job
of
walking
home
eh
i
do
think
i
enjoy
it
much
beatrice
said
showing
her
one
dimple
conspicuously
i
rather
throw
up
your
hands
growled
a
voice
from
somewhere
keith
wheeled
toward
the
sound
and
a
bullet
spatted
into
the
yellow
clay
two
inches
from
the
toe
of
his
boot
also
a
rifle
cracked
sharply
he
took
the
hint
and
put
his
hands
immediately
on
a
level
with
his
hat
crown
no
use
he
called
out
ruefully
i
have
anything
to
return
the
compliment
well
i
got
t
have
the
papers
fur
that
mister
retorted
the
voice
and
a
man
appeared
from
the
shelter
of
a
rock
and
came
slowly
down
to
them
a
man
and
lank
with
haggard
unshaven
face
and
eyes
that
had
hunger
and
dogged
endurance
looking
out
he
picked
his
way
carefully
with
his
feet
his
eyes
and
the
rifle
fixed
unswervingly
at
the
two
beatrice
was
too
astonished
to
make
a
sound
what
sort
of
a
do
you
call
this
demanded
keith
hotly
his
hands
itching
to
be
down
and
busy
we
do
carry
rolls
of
money
around
in
the
hills
you
fool
oh
damn
your
money
the
man
said
roughly
i
got
money
t
burn
i
want
t
trade
horses
with
yuh
that
roan
there
looks
like
a
stayer
i
take
well
seeing
you
seem
to
be
head
push
here
i
guess
it
a
trade
keith
answered
but
i
thank
you
for
my
own
beatrice
whose
hands
were
up
beside
her
ears
and
not
an
inch
higher
changed
from
amazed
curiosity
to
concern
oh
you
must
take
redcloud
away
from
cameron
she
protested
you
do
know
he
so
fond
of
that
horse
you
may
take
mine
he
a
good
horse
he
a
perfectly
splendid
horse
but
i
i
not
so
attached
to
the
fellow
stopped
and
looked
at
her
not
however
forgetting
keith
who
was
growing
restive
beatrice
cheeks
were
very
pink
and
her
eyes
were
bright
and
big
and
earnest
he
could
not
look
into
them
without
letting
some
of
the
sternness
drop
out
of
his
own
i
wish
you
please
take
rex
i
rather
trade
than
not
she
coaxed
when
beatrice
coaxed
mere
man
must
yield
or
run
the
fellow
was
but
human
and
he
was
not
in
a
position
to
run
so
he
grinned
and
wavered
it
fair
to
say
you
get
done
he
remarked
his
eyes
upon
the
odd
little
dimple
at
the
corner
of
her
mouth
as
if
he
had
never
seen
anything
quite
so
fetching
your
horse
wo
cr
buck
will
he
she
ventured
doubtfully
this
was
her
first
horse
trade
and
it
behooved
her
to
be
cautious
even
at
the
point
of
a
rifle
well
no
said
the
man
laconically
he
wo
he
oh
beatrice
gasped
and
blushed
she
might
have
known
she
thought
that
the
fellow
would
not
take
all
this
trouble
if
his
horse
was
in
a
condition
to
buck
then
my
elbows
hurt
i
i
think
i
should
like
to
sit
sure
said
the
man
politely
make
yourself
comfortable
i
ai
used
t
dealin
with
ladies
but
you
got
t
set
still
yuh
know
and
not
try
any
tricks
i
can
put
up
a
mighty
swift
gun
play
when
i
need
to
and
your
bein
a
lady
would
cut
no
ice
in
a
case
uh
that
thank
beatrice
sat
down
upon
the
nearest
rock
folded
her
hands
meekly
and
looked
from
him
to
keith
who
seethed
to
claim
a
good
deal
of
the
man
attention
she
observed
that
at
a
long
breath
from
keith
his
captor
was
instantly
alert
maybe
your
elbows
ache
too
he
remarked
dryly
they
git
over
it
though
i
knowed
a
man
t
grab
at
the
clouds
upwards
of
an
hour
no
harm
that
encouraging
i
keith
shifted
to
the
other
foot
how
that
sorrel
demanded
the
man
can
he
go
keith
hesitated
a
second
indeed
he
can
go
put
in
beatrice
eagerly
he
every
bit
as
good
as
is
that
sorrel
yours
the
man
eyes
shifted
briefly
to
her
face
beatrice
thinking
how
she
had
meant
to
own
him
blushed
that
accounts
for
he
laughed
unpleasantly
i
wondered
why
you
was
so
dead
anxious
t
have
me
take
the
eyes
of
beatrice
snapped
sparks
at
him
but
her
manner
was
demure
not
to
say
meek
he
belongs
to
my
brother
she
explained
and
my
brother
has
dozens
of
good
cameron
horse
is
a
pet
it
different
when
a
horse
follows
you
all
over
the
place
and
fairly
talks
to
you
he
shake
hands
and
i
see
the
point
i
guess
what
say
kid
keith
might
seem
boyish
but
he
did
not
enjoy
being
addressed
as
he
was
years
old
whether
he
looked
it
or
not
i
say
this
if
you
take
my
horse
i
kill
you
i
have
camping
on
your
trail
before
sundown
if
you
take
this
girl
horse
i
do
the
the
man
shut
his
lips
in
a
thin
line
no
he
wo
cried
beatrice
leaning
forward
do
mind
a
thing
he
says
you
ca
expect
a
man
to
keep
his
temper
with
his
hands
up
in
the
air
like
that
you
take
rex
and
i
promise
for
trix
miss
lansell
sternly
i
promise
you
he
wo
do
a
thing
she
went
on
firmly
he
he
half
as
fierce
really
as
as
he
keith
face
got
red
the
man
laughed
a
little
evidently
the
situation
amused
him
whether
the
others
could
see
the
humor
of
it
or
not
so
i
to
have
your
cayuse
eh
keith
saw
two
big
tears
tipping
over
her
lower
lids
and
gritted
his
teeth
well
it
ai
often
i
git
a
chance
t
please
a
lady
the
fellow
decided
i
guess
rex
do
all
right
go
over
and
change
saddles
youngster
and
do
git
gay
i
got
the
drop
and
yuh
notice
keeping
are
you
going
to
take
his
saddle
beatrice
stood
up
and
clenched
her
hands
looking
very
much
as
if
she
would
like
to
pull
his
hair
keith
in
trouble
appealed
to
her
strangely
sure
thing
it
a
peach
from
the
look
of
it
mine
over
the
hill
a
piece
step
along
there
kid
i
want
t
be
you
need
to
go
some
flared
keith
over
his
shoulder
i
expect
t
go
some
retorted
the
man
a
fellow
with
three
posses
campin
on
his
trail
ai
apt
t
loiter
oh
beatrice
sat
down
and
stared
then
you
must
be
yep
the
fellow
laughed
recklessly
you
ca
tell
your
maw
yuh
met
up
with
kelly
the
darin
i
would
be
if
she
close
herded
yuh
fer
a
spell
till
her
scare
wears
off
bu
i
hung
around
these
parts
long
enough
i
fooled
them
sheriffs
stayin
here
gee
swift
i
do
think
this
last
sentence
was
directed
at
keith
who
was
putting
a
snail
to
shame
and
making
it
appear
he
was
in
a
hurry
git
a
move
on
commanded
kelly
threatening
with
his
eyes
keith
wisely
made
no
reply
nor
did
he
show
any
symptoms
of
haste
despite
the
menacing
tone
slowly
he
pulled
his
saddle
off
redcloud
and
carefully
he
placed
it
upon
the
ground
when
a
fellow
lives
in
his
saddle
almost
he
comes
to
think
a
great
deal
of
it
and
he
is
reluctant
under
any
circumstances
to
surrender
it
to
another
to
have
a
man
deliberately
confiscate
it
with
the
authority
which
lies
in
a
lump
of
lead
the
size
of
a
child
thumb
is
not
pleasant
through
keith
brain
flashed
a
dozen
impracticable
plans
and
one
that
offered
a
slender
very
slender
chance
of
success
if
he
could
get
a
little
closer
he
moved
over
beside
rex
an
unbuckling
the
cinch
of
beatrice
saddle
pulled
it
sullenly
off
now
put
your
saddle
on
that
there
rex
horse
and
cinch
it
tight
keith
picked
up
the
saddle
his
saddle
and
threw
it
across
rex
back
raging
inwardly
at
his
helplessness
to
lose
his
saddle
worse
to
let
beatrice
lose
her
horse
lord
a
pretty
figure
he
must
cut
in
her
eyes
dry
weather
we
havin
kelly
remarked
politely
to
beatrice
without
however
looking
in
her
direction
prairie
fires
are
t
be
the
regular
thing
i
beatrice
studied
his
face
and
found
no
ulterior
purpose
for
the
words
yes
she
agreed
as
pleasantly
as
she
could
in
view
of
the
disquieting
circumstances
i
helped
fight
a
last
week
over
this
way
we
were
out
all
is
mean
things
t
handle
oncet
they
git
started
i
always
hate
t
see
git
hold
of
the
grass
what
fire
was
that
you
mention
beatrice
glanced
toward
keith
and
was
thankful
his
back
was
turned
to
her
but
a
quick
suspicion
had
come
to
her
and
she
went
steadily
on
with
the
subject
it
was
the
pine
ridge
country
it
started
very
it
was
no
mystery
t
kelly
laughed
grimly
i
started
that
there
blaze
myself
accidentally
i
throwed
a
cigarette
down
it
had
gone
out
after
a
while
i
seen
a
blaze
where
i
jest
left
but
i
did
have
no
license
t
go
back
an
put
it
out
my
orders
was
to
git
out
uh
that
i
seen
the
sky
all
lit
up
that
night
kid
are
yuh
goin
sleep
keith
started
he
had
been
listening
and
thanking
his
lucky
star
that
beatrice
was
listening
also
if
she
had
suspected
him
of
setting
the
range
afire
she
knew
better
now
a
weight
lifted
off
keith
shoulders
and
he
stood
a
bit
straighter
those
chance
words
meant
a
great
deal
to
him
and
he
felt
that
he
would
not
grudge
his
saddle
in
payment
but
rex
that
was
another
matter
beatrice
should
not
lose
him
if
he
could
prevent
it
still
what
could
he
do
he
might
turn
and
spring
upon
kelly
but
in
the
meantime
kelly
would
not
be
idle
he
would
probably
be
pumping
bullets
out
of
the
rifle
into
keith
body
and
he
would
still
have
the
horse
he
stole
a
glance
at
beatrice
and
went
hot
all
over
at
what
he
thought
he
read
in
her
eyes
for
once
he
was
not
glad
to
be
near
his
heart
desire
he
wished
her
elsewhere
anywhere
but
sitting
on
that
rock
over
there
with
her
little
gloved
hands
folded
quietly
in
her
lap
and
that
adorable
demure
look
on
her
face
the
look
which
would
have
put
her
mother
instantly
upon
the
defensive
and
a
gleam
in
her
eyes
keith
read
for
scorn
surely
he
might
do
something
barely
six
feet
now
separated
him
from
kelly
if
one
of
those
lumps
of
rock
that
strewed
the
ground
was
in
his
hand
he
stooped
to
reach
under
rex
body
for
the
cinch
and
could
almost
feel
kelly
eyes
boring
into
his
back
a
false
move
well
keith
had
heard
of
kelly
a
good
many
times
if
this
fellow
was
really
the
man
he
claimed
to
be
keith
did
not
need
to
guess
what
would
follow
a
suspicious
move
he
knew
he
looked
stealthily
toward
him
and
eyes
met
his
with
a
gleam
sinister
kelly
grinned
i
would
kid
he
said
softly
keith
swore
in
a
whisper
and
his
fingers
closed
upon
the
cinch
it
was
no
use
to
fight
the
devil
with
cunning
he
thought
bitterly
just
then
beatrice
gave
an
unearthly
screech
that
made
the
knees
bend
under
them
when
keith
whirled
to
see
what
it
was
she
was
standing
upon
the
rock
with
her
skirts
held
tightly
around
her
like
the
pictures
of
women
when
a
mouse
gets
into
the
room
oh
cameron
a
came
a
metallic
the
unmistakable
war
cry
of
the
rattler
into
kelly
eyes
came
a
look
of
fear
and
he
sidled
gingerly
the
buzz
had
sounded
unpleasantly
close
to
his
heels
for
one
brief
instant
the
cold
eye
of
his
rifle
regarded
harmlessly
the
hillside
during
that
instant
a
goodly
piece
of
sandstone
whinged
under
his
jaw
and
he
went
down
with
keith
upon
him
like
a
mountain
lion
the
latter
snatched
the
rifle
and
got
up
hurriedly
for
he
had
not
forgotten
the
rattler
kelly
lay
looking
up
at
him
in
a
dazed
way
that
might
have
been
funny
at
any
other
time
i
wondered
if
you
were
good
at
grasping
opportunities
said
beatrice
when
he
looked
there
she
was
sitting
down
on
the
rock
with
her
little
gloved
hands
folded
in
her
lap
and
that
adorable
demure
look
on
her
face
and
a
gleam
in
her
eyes
he
knew
was
not
scorn
though
he
could
not
rightly
tell
what
it
really
did
mean
keith
wondered
at
her
vaguely
but
a
man
ca
have
his
mind
on
a
dozen
things
at
once
it
was
important
that
he
keep
a
sharp
watch
on
kelly
and
his
eyes
were
searching
for
a
gleaming
gray
spotted
coil
which
he
felt
to
be
near
you
need
look
cameron
there
is
any
snake
it
it
was
you
keith
jaw
dropped
look
out
cameron
it
would
work
a
second
time
i
keith
turned
back
before
kelly
had
more
than
got
to
his
elbow
plainly
kelly
was
not
feeling
well
just
then
he
looked
unhappy
and
rather
sick
if
you
hand
me
the
gun
cameron
i
think
i
can
hold
it
steady
while
you
fix
the
saddles
and
then
we
go
home
i
i
do
think
i
really
care
to
climb
the
what
keith
wanted
to
do
was
to
take
her
in
his
arms
and
kiss
her
till
he
was
tired
what
he
did
do
was
back
toward
her
and
let
her
take
the
rifle
quickly
and
deftly
from
his
hands
she
rested
the
gun
upon
her
knee
and
brought
it
to
bear
upon
kelly
with
a
composure
not
assuring
to
that
gentleman
and
she
tried
to
look
as
if
she
really
and
truly
would
shoot
a
man
and
managed
to
look
only
the
more
kissable
do
squirm
kelly
i
wo
bite
if
i
do
buzz
kelly
stared
at
her
meditatively
a
minute
and
said
well
i
be
damned
keith
looked
at
her
also
but
he
did
not
say
anything
the
way
he
slapped
his
saddle
back
upon
redcloud
and
cinched
it
and
saddled
rex
was
a
pretty
exhibition
of
precision
and
speed
learned
in
roundup
camps
kelly
watched
him
grimly
i
knowed
you
was
as
swift
as
yuh
knew
how
be
a
while
back
he
commented
i
got
this
t
say
fur
you
two
you
a
little
the
toughest
proposition
i
ever
run
up
and
i
been
up
it
good
and
thanks
keith
said
cheerfully
you
better
take
rex
now
and
go
ahead
miss
lansell
i
take
that
gun
and
look
after
this
fellow
get
up
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
kelly
got
unsteadily
upon
his
feet
beatrice
looked
at
him
and
then
at
keith
she
asked
a
question
march
him
home
and
send
him
in
to
the
nearest
keith
was
businesslike
and
his
tone
was
crisp
beatrice
eyes
turned
again
to
kelly
he
did
not
whine
or
beg
or
even
curse
he
stood
looking
straight
before
him
at
something
only
his
memory
could
see
and
in
his
face
was
weariness
and
a
deep
loneliness
and
a
certain
grim
despair
there
was
an
ugly
bruise
where
the
rock
had
struck
but
the
rest
of
his
face
was
drawn
and
white
if
you
do
that
cried
beatrice
in
a
voice
hardly
more
than
a
fierce
whisper
i
shall
hate
you
always
you
are
not
a
let
him
stay
here
and
take
his
chance
in
the
keith
was
not
a
hard
man
to
persuade
into
being
merciful
it
easy
enough
to
say
yes
miss
lansell
i
always
was
when
a
fellow
seemed
down
on
his
luck
you
can
stay
here
kelly
i
do
want
you
he
laughed
boyishly
and
irresponsibly
for
he
felt
that
kelly
had
done
him
a
service
that
day
beatrice
flashed
him
a
smile
that
went
to
his
head
and
made
him
dizzy
and
took
up
rex
bridle
rein
she
hesitated
looked
doubtfully
at
kelly
who
stood
waiting
stoically
and
turned
to
her
saddle
she
untied
a
bundle
and
went
quickly
over
to
him
you
i
do
want
my
lunch
after
all
i
going
home
now
i
i
want
you
to
take
it
please
there
are
some
sandwiches
with
veal
loaf
that
looey
sam
makes
deliciously
and
some
cake
i
i
wish
it
was
more
i
know
you
like
the
veal
kelly
looked
down
at
her
and
god
knows
what
thoughts
were
in
his
mind
he
did
not
answer
her
with
words
he
just
swallowed
hard
poor
devil
was
what
keith
said
to
himself
and
the
gun
he
was
holding
threatened
for
a
minute
to
wing
a
cloud
beatrice
laid
the
package
in
kelly
unresisting
hand
looked
up
into
his
averted
face
and
said
simply
after
that
she
hurried
rex
up
the
steep
ridge
much
faster
than
she
had
gone
down
it
endangering
his
bones
and
putting
herself
very
empty
lunged
at
the
top
of
the
ridge
keith
stopped
and
looked
down
hi
kelly
kelly
showed
that
he
heard
here
your
gun
on
this
rock
you
can
come
up
and
get
it
if
you
want
to
and
say
i
got
a
few
broke
horses
ranging
down
here
somewhere
vn
brand
on
left
shoulder
i
wo
scour
the
hills
very
bad
if
i
should
happen
to
miss
a
cayuse
so
long
kelly
waved
his
hand
for
farewell
chapter
keith
masterful
wooing
keith
faced
toward
home
with
redcloud
following
at
his
heels
like
a
pet
dog
for
some
reason
which
he
did
not
try
to
analyze
he
was
feeling
light
of
heart
as
though
something
very
nice
had
happened
to
him
it
might
have
been
the
unexpected
clearing
up
of
the
mystery
of
the
though
he
was
not
dwelling
particularly
upon
that
he
was
thinking
a
great
deal
more
of
beatrice
eyes
which
had
never
been
more
baffling
so
far
as
he
knew
and
his
blood
was
still
dancing
with
the
smile
she
had
given
him
it
hardly
seemed
possible
that
a
girl
could
smile
just
like
that
and
not
mean
anything
when
he
reached
the
level
where
she
was
waiting
for
him
he
saw
that
she
had
her
arms
around
the
neck
of
her
horse
and
that
she
was
crying
dismally
with
an
abandon
that
took
no
thought
of
his
presence
keith
had
never
seen
a
girl
cry
like
that
before
he
had
seen
them
dab
at
their
eyes
with
their
handkerchief
and
smile
the
next
breath
but
this
was
different
for
a
minute
he
did
quite
know
what
to
do
he
could
hear
the
blood
hammering
against
his
temples
while
he
stood
dumbly
watching
her
he
went
hesitatingly
up
and
laid
a
gloved
hand
deprecatingly
upon
her
shoulder
do
do
that
miss
lansell
the
fellow
is
worth
it
he
only
living
the
life
he
chose
for
himself
and
he
does
mind
not
half
as
much
as
you
imagine
i
know
how
you
feel
i
felt
sorry
for
him
myself
but
he
does
deserve
it
you
he
stopped
not
being
able
just
at
the
moment
to
think
of
anything
more
to
say
about
kelly
beatrice
who
had
not
been
thinking
of
kelly
at
all
but
remorsefully
of
a
fellow
she
had
persisted
in
misjudging
only
cried
the
harder
do
do
cry
like
that
i
miss
lansell
trix
darling
snapped
suddenly
like
a
rope
when
the
strain
becomes
too
great
he
caught
her
fiercely
in
his
arms
and
crushed
her
close
against
him
beatrice
stopped
crying
and
gasped
trixie
if
you
must
cry
i
wish
you
cry
for
me
i
about
as
miserable
a
man
i
want
you
so
god
made
you
for
me
and
i
starving
for
the
feel
of
your
lips
on
then
keith
who
was
nothing
if
not
daring
once
he
was
roused
bent
and
kissed
her
without
waiting
to
see
if
he
might
and
not
only
once
but
several
times
beatrice
made
a
attempt
to
get
free
of
his
arms
but
keith
was
not
a
fool
he
held
her
closer
and
laughed
from
pure
primitive
joy
mr
cameron
it
was
beatrice
voice
but
it
had
never
been
like
that
before
i
think
you
might
call
me
keith
he
cut
in
you
got
to
begin
some
time
and
now
is
as
good
a
time
as
you
you
taking
a
good
deal
for
granted
she
said
wriggling
unavailingly
in
his
arms
a
man
got
to
with
a
girl
like
you
you
so
used
to
turning
a
fellow
down
i
believe
you
do
it
just
from
indeed
she
was
trying
to
be
sarcastic
and
got
kissed
for
her
pains
yes
he
mimicked
her
tone
i
want
you
i
want
you
i
wanted
you
long
before
i
ever
saw
you
and
so
i
not
taking
any
chances
i
did
dare
you
see
i
just
had
to
take
you
first
and
ask
you
beatrice
laughed
a
little
with
tears
very
close
to
her
lashes
and
gave
up
what
was
the
use
of
trying
to
resist
this
masterful
fellow
who
would
not
even
give
her
a
chance
to
refuse
him
she
did
not
know
quite
how
to
say
no
to
a
man
who
did
not
ask
her
to
say
yes
but
the
queer
part
to
her
was
the
feeling
that
she
would
have
hated
to
say
no
anyway
it
never
occurred
to
her
till
afterward
that
she
might
have
stood
upon
a
pedestal
of
offended
dignity
and
cried
unhand
me
villain
and
that
if
she
had
keith
would
undoubtedly
have
complied
instantly
as
it
was
she
just
laughed
softly
and
blushed
a
good
deal
i
believe
mama
is
right
about
you
after
all
she
said
wickedly
at
heart
you
a
bold
maybe
i
know
i
not
stand
and
see
some
other
fellow
walk
off
with
my
heart
desire
without
putting
up
a
fight
it
did
look
pretty
blue
for
me
though
and
i
was
afraid
but
it
all
right
now
is
it
possession
is
nine
points
in
law
they
say
and
i
got
you
now
going
to
keep
you
too
when
are
you
going
to
come
over
and
take
charge
of
the
cross
ranch
dear
me
said
beatrice
snuggling
against
his
shoulder
and
finding
it
the
best
place
in
the
world
to
be
i
never
said
i
was
going
to
take
charge
at
all
then
the
impulse
of
confession
seized
her
will
you
hate
me
if
i
tell
you
something
i
expect
i
will
keith
assented
his
eyes
positively
idolatrous
what
is
it
girlie
well
i
it
was
dick
fault
i
never
would
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
if
he
had
goaded
me
into
it
but
well
i
was
going
to
make
you
propose
on
a
wager
the
brown
head
of
beatrice
went
down
out
of
sight
on
his
arm
i
was
going
to
refuse
you
and
get
rex
i
keith
held
her
closer
than
ever
dick
rode
over
and
told
me
that
day
and
i
was
going
to
give
you
a
chance
missy
if
you
started
to
cry
here
oh
what
the
use
you
did
refuse
me
and
you
not
going
to
either
are
you
girlie
beatrice
intimated
that
there
was
no
immediate
danger
of
such
a
thing
happening
you
see
dick
and
i
felt
that
you
belonged
to
me
by
rights
i
fell
in
love
with
a
picture
of
you
that
you
sent
him
that
one
taken
in
your
graduation
gown
and
i
told
dick
i
was
going
to
take
the
next
train
east
and
carry
you
off
by
force
if
i
could
get
you
any
other
way
but
dick
thought
i
stand
a
better
show
to
wait
till
he
coaxed
you
out
here
we
had
it
all
fixed
that
you
come
and
find
a
prairie
knight
that
was
ready
to
fight
for
you
and
he
make
you
like
him
whether
you
wanted
to
or
not
and
then
he
keep
you
here
and
we
all
be
happy
ever
after
and
dick
would
pull
out
of
the
northern
pool
and
of
course
you
would
and
we
have
a
company
of
our
own
oh
we
had
some
great
castles
built
out
here
on
the
prairie
let
me
tell
you
and
then
when
you
finally
came
here
you
had
milord
tagging
along
and
you
thinking
you
were
in
love
with
him
maybe
you
think
i
was
shaky
girlie
the
air
castles
got
awfully
wobbly
and
it
looked
like
they
were
going
to
cave
in
on
us
but
i
was
bound
to
stay
in
the
game
if
i
could
and
dick
did
all
he
could
to
get
you
to
looking
my
way
and
it
all
right
it
trixie
keith
kept
recurring
to
the
ecstatic
realization
that
it
was
all
right
beatrice
meditated
for
a
minute
i
never
dreamed
dick
never
even
mentioned
you
in
any
of
his
letters
she
said
in
a
rather
dazed
tone
and
when
i
came
he
made
me
believe
you
were
a
horrible
flirt
and
i
never
can
resist
the
temptation
to
measure
and
take
a
fall
out
of
a
male
flirt
keith
supplemented
dick
he
went
on
sententiously
and
slangily
was
dead
onto
his
after
that
he
helped
her
into
the
saddle
and
they
rode
blissfully
homeward
near
the
ranch
they
met
dick
who
pulled
up
and
eyed
them
anxiously
at
first
and
then
with
a
broad
smile
say
trix
he
queried
slyly
who
does
rex
belong
to
keith
came
to
the
rescue
promptly
just
as
a
brave
knight
should
you
he
retorted
but
i
tell
you
right
now
he
wo
very
long
you
going
to
do
the
decent
thing
and
give
him
to
trixie
for
a
wedding
dick
looked
as
though
trix
was
welcome
to
any
thing
he
possessed
chapter
sir
redmond
gets
his
answer
before
long

at
the
thought
of

buttered
a
fluffy
biscuit
for
her
idol
dorman
took
two
bites
while
he
considered

his
auntie
cautiously
his
auntie

a
conscientious
woman
and
she
knew
very
little
about
puppies
will
help
me
take
care
of

remarked
comfortably
then
something
in
his
divinity
face
startled
his
assurance

want
you
to
help
take
care
of
my
two
puppies
martha
ca
she
slaps
dere
ears
is
you
going
wis
us
this
at
the
dinner
table
was
to
say
the
least
embarrassing
especially
on
this
especial
evening
when
beatrice
was
trying
to
muster
courage
to
give
sir
redmond
the
only
answer
it
was
possible
to
give
him
now
it
was
an
open
secret
that
in
case
she
had
accepted
him
the
of
miss
hayes
would
be
delayed
a
bit
when
they
would
all
go
together
beatrice
had
overheard
her
mother
and
miss
hayes
discussing
this
possibility
only
the
day
before
she
undertook
the
impossible
and
attempted
to
head
dorman
off
perhaps
you
see
a
whale
honey
the
puppies
never
saw
a
whale
sure
what
do
you
suppose
they
think
is
you
going
you
have
to
hold
them
up
high
you
know
so
they
could
see
and
show
them
just
where
to
look
and
is
you
going
beatrice
sent
a
quick
despairing
glance
around
the
table
four
pairs
of
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
with
varying
degrees
of
interest
and
anxiety
the
fifth
pair
dick
were
trying
to
hide
their
unrighteous
glee
by
glaring
down
at
the
chicken
wing
on
his
plate
beatrice
felt
a
strong
impulse
to
throw
something
at
him
she
gulped
and
faced
the
inevitable
it
must
come
some
time
she
thought
and
it
might
as
well
be
now
though
it
did
seem
a
pity
to
spoil
a
good
dinner
for
every
one
but
dick
who
was
eating
his
with
relish
no
honey
her
voice
was
clear
and
had
the
note
of
finality
i
not
going
sir
redmond
teeth
went
together
with
a
click
and
he
picked
up
the
pepper
shaker
mechanically
and
peppered
his
salad
until
it
was
perfectly
black
and
beatrice
wondered
how
he
ever
expected
to
eat
it
lansell
dropped
her
fork
on
the
floor
and
had
to
have
a
clean
one
brought
miss
hayes
sent
a
frightened
glance
at
her
brother
dick
sat
and
ate
fried
chicken
why

wants

need

and
dorman
gathered
himself
for
the
last
crushing
argument
and
uncle
redmon
wants

beatrice
took
a
sip
of
ice
water
for
she
needed
it
why
let
you
go
guess
ca
she
go
it
was
lansell
turn
to
test
the
exquisite
torture
of
that
prickly
chill
along
the
spine
like
beatrice
she
dodged
little
boys
she
announced
weakly
should
not
speak
until
spoken
dick
came
near
strangling
on
a
shred
of
chicken
ca
she
go
say
ca
she
tell
to
go

wis
us
beatrice
lansell
swallowed

not
a
little
child

dorman

a
woman
and

the
whole
group

a
squeal
of
triumph
see

will
go
wo
you
say
yes

said
beatrice
with
desperate
emphasis
i
i
want
to
dorman
slid
down
upon
his
shoulder
blades
gave
a
squeal
which
was
not
triumph
but
temper
and
kicked
the
table
till
every
dish
on
it
danced
dorman
sit
up
commanded
his
auntie
dorman
stop
this
instant
ashamed
of
you
where
is
my
good
little
man
sir
redmond
seemed
glad
of
the
chance
to
do
something
besides
sit
quietly
in
his
place
and
look
calm
he
got
up
deliberately
and
in
two
minutes
or
less
dorman
was
in
the
woodshed
with
him
making
sounds
that
frightened
his
puppies
dreadfully
and
put
the
coyotes
to
shame
beatrice
left
the
table
hurriedly
to
escape
the
angry
eyes
of
her
mother
the
sounds
in
the
woodshed
had
died
to
a
subdued
sniffling
and
she
retreated
to
the
front
porch
hoping
to
escape
observation
there
she
nearly
ran
against
sir
redmond
who
was
staring
off
into
the
dusk
to
where
the
moon
was
peering
redly
over
a
black
pinnacle
of
the
bear
paws
she
would
have
slipped
back
into
the
house
but
he
did
not
give
her
the
chance
he
turned
and
faced
her
steadily
as
he
had
more
than
once
faced
the
boers
when
he
knew
that
before
him
was
nothing
but
defeat
so
you
not
going
to
england
ever
pride
had
squeezed
every
shade
of
emotion
from
his
voice
beatrice
gripped
her
fingers
together
tightly
are
you
sure
you
wo
be
sorry
afterward
yes
i
beatrice
had
never
done
anything
she
hated
more
sir
redmond
looking
into
her
eyes
wondered
why
those
sharpshooters
the
boers
had
blundered
and
passed
him
by
i
do
suppose
it
matters
much
now
but
will
you
tell
me
why
i
believed
you
would
decide
he
was
holding
his
voice
down
to
a
dead
level
and
it
was
not
easy
because
beatrice
faced
the
moon
which
threw
a
soft
glow
upon
her
face
and
into
her
wonderful
deep
eyes
a
golden
light
oh
i
sorry
sir
redmond
but
you
see
i
did
know
i
i
just
learned
what
it
means
to
to
love
i
i
am
going
to
stay
here
a
new
company
is
about
to
be
formed
sir
redmond
the
maltese
cross
and
the
triangle
bar
are
going
to
cast
their
lot
the
golden
glow
deepened
and
darkened
and
blended
with
the
red
blood
which
flushed
cheek
and
brow
and
throat
it
took
sir
redmond
a
full
minute
to
comprehend
when
he
did
he
breathed
deep
shut
his
lips
upon
words
that
would
have
frightened
her
and
went
down
the
steps
into
the
gloom
beatrice
watched
him
stride
away
into
the
dusky
silence
and
her
heart
ached
with
sympathy
for
him
then
she
looked
beyond
to
where
the
lights
of
the
cross
ranch
twinkled
joyously
far
down
the
coulee
and
the
sweet
egotism
of
happiness
enfolded
her
shutting
him
out
after
that
she
forgot
him
utterly
she
looked
up
at
the
moon
sailing
off
to
meet
the
stars
smiled
and
then
went
in
to
face
her
mother
