it
was
very
still
in
the
small
neglected
chapel
the
noises
of
the
farm
came
faintly
through
closed
doors
voices
shouting
at
the
oxen
in
the
lower
fields
the
querulous
bark
of
the
old
and
angry
calls
to
the
little
foundling
in
the
kitchen
the
february
day
was
closing
and
a
ray
of
sunshine
slanting
through
a
slit
in
the
chapel
wall
brought
out
the
vision
of
a
pale
haloed
head
floating
against
the
dusky
background
of
the
chancel
like
a
on
its
leaf
the
face
was
that
of
the
saint
of
assisi
a
sunken
ravaged
countenance
lit
with
an
ecstasy
of
suffering
that
seemed
not
so
much
to
reflect
the
anguish
of
the
christ
at
whose
feet
the
saint
knelt
as
the
mute
pain
of
all
poor
folk
on
earth
when
the
small
odo
valsecca
the
only
frequenter
of
the
chapel
had
been
taunted
by
the
farmer
wife
for
being
a
beggar
brat
or
when
his
ears
were
tingling
from
the
heavy
hand
of
the
farmer
son
he
found
a
melancholy
kinship
in
that
suffering
face
but
since
he
had
fighting
blood
in
him
too
coming
on
the
mother
side
of
the
rude
piedmontese
stock
of
the
marquesses
di
donnaz
there
were
other
moods
when
he
turned
instead
to
the
stout
saint
george
in
gold
armour
just
discernible
through
the
grime
and
dust
of
the
opposite
wall
the
chapel
of
pontesordo
was
indeed
as
wonderful
a
storybook
as
fate
ever
unrolled
before
the
eyes
of
a
neglected
and
solitary
child
for
a
hundred
years
or
more
pontesordo
a
fortified
manor
of
the
dukes
of
pianura
had
been
used
as
a
farmhouse
and
the
chapel
was
never
opened
save
when
on
easter
sunday
a
priest
came
from
the
town
to
say
mass
at
other
times
it
stood
abandoned
cobwebs
curtaining
the
narrow
windows
farm
tools
leaning
against
the
walls
and
the
dust
deep
on
the
and
acanthus
volutes
of
the
altar
the
manor
of
pontesordo
was
very
old
the
country
people
said
that
the
great
warlock
virgil
whose
was
at
mantua
had
once
shut
himself
up
for
a
year
in
the
topmost
chamber
of
the
keep
engaged
in
unholy
researches
and
another
legend
related
that
alda
wife
of
an
early
lord
of
pianura
had
thrown
herself
from
its
battlements
to
escape
the
pursuit
of
the
terrible
ezzelino
the
chapel
adjoined
this
keep
and
filomena
the
wife
told
odo
that
it
was
even
older
than
the
tower
and
that
the
walls
had
been
painted
by
early
martyrs
who
had
concealed
themselves
there
from
the
persecutions
of
the
pagan
emperors
on
such
questions
a
child
of
odo
age
could
obviously
have
no
pronounced
opinion
the
less
so
as
filomena
facts
varied
according
to
the
seasons
or
her
mood
so
that
on
a
day
of
east
wind
or
when
the
worms
were
not
hatching
well
she
had
been
known
to
affirm
that
the
pagans
had
painted
the
chapel
under
virgil
instruction
to
commemorate
the
christians
they
had
tortured
in
spite
of
the
distance
to
which
these
conflicting
statements
seemed
to
relegate
them
odo
somehow
felt
as
though
these
pale
strange
people
youths
with
ardent
faces
under
their
small
round
caps
damsels
with
hair
and
boys
no
bigger
than
himself
holding
spotted
dogs
in
leash
were
younger
and
nearer
to
him
than
the
dwellers
on
the
farm
jacopone
the
farmer
the
shrill
filomena
who
was
odo
the
hulking
bully
their
son
and
the
abate
who
once
a
week
came
out
from
pianura
to
give
odo
religious
instruction
and
who
dismissed
his
questions
with
the
invariable
exhortation
not
to
pry
into
matters
that
were
beyond
his
years
odo
had
loved
the
pictures
in
the
chapel
all
the
better
since
the
abate
with
a
shrug
had
told
him
they
were
nothing
but
old
rubbish
the
work
of
the
barbarians
life
at
pontesordo
was
in
truth
not
very
pleasant
for
an
ardent
and
sensitive
little
boy
of
nine
whose
remote
connection
with
the
reigning
line
of
pianura
did
not
preserve
him
from
wearing
torn
clothes
and
eating
black
bread
and
beans
out
of
an
earthen
bowl
on
the
kitchen
doorstep
go
ask
your
mother
for
new
clothes
filomena
would
snap
at
him
when
his
toes
came
through
his
shoes
and
the
rents
in
his
had
spread
beyond
darning
these
you
are
wearing
are
my
giannozzo
as
you
well
know
and
every
rag
on
your
back
is
mine
if
there
were
any
law
for
poor
folk
for
not
a
copper
of
pay
for
your
keep
or
a
stitch
of
clothing
for
your
body
have
we
had
these
two
years
come
assumption
that
you
ca
ask
your
mother
you
say
because
she
never
comes
here
true
enough
fine
ladies
let
their
brats
live
in
but
they
must
have
indian
carpets
under
their
own
feet
well
ask
the
abate
then
he
has
lace
ruffles
to
his
coat
and
a
naked
woman
painted
on
his
snuff
box
what
he
only
holds
his
hands
up
when
you
ask
well
then
go
ask
your
friends
on
the
maybe
they
give
you
a
pair
of
shoes
though
saint
francis
for
that
matter
was
the
father
of
the
discalced
and
would
doubtless
tell
you
to
go
without
and
she
would
add
with
a
coarse
laugh
do
you
know
that
the
discalced
are
shod
with
gold
it
was
after
such
a
scene
that
the
as
they
called
him
at
pontesordo
would
steal
away
to
the
chapel
and
seating
himself
on
an
upturned
basket
or
a
heap
of
pumpkins
gaze
long
into
the
face
of
the
mournful
saint
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
odo
lot
it
was
that
of
many
children
in
the
eighteenth
century
especially
those
whose
parents
were
cadets
of
noble
houses
with
an
appanage
barely
sufficient
to
keep
their
wives
and
themselves
in
court
finery
much
less
to
pay
their
debts
and
clothe
and
educate
their
children
all
over
italy
at
that
moment
had
odo
valsecca
but
known
it
were
lads
whose
ancestors
like
his
own
had
been
dukes
and
crusaders
but
who
none
the
less
were
faring
as
he
fared
on
black
bread
and
hard
blows
and
the
taunts
of
unpaid
many
doubtless
there
were
who
cared
little
enough
as
long
as
they
might
play
morro
with
the
farmer
lads
and
ride
the
colt
through
the
pasture
and
go
and
with
the
village
children
but
some
perhaps
like
odo
suffered
in
a
dumb
animal
way
without
understanding
why
life
was
so
hard
on
little
boys
odo
for
his
part
had
small
taste
for
the
sports
in
which
gianozzo
and
the
village
lads
took
pleasure
he
shrank
from
any
amusement
associated
with
the
frightening
or
hurting
of
animals
and
his
bosom
swelled
with
the
fine
gentleman
scorn
of
the
clowns
who
got
their
fun
in
so
coarse
a
way
now
and
then
he
found
a
moment
glee
in
a
sharp
tussle
with
one
of
the
younger
children
who
had
been
tormenting
a
frog
or
a
beetle
but
he
was
still
too
young
for
real
fighting
and
could
only
hang
on
the
outskirts
when
the
bigger
boys
closed
and
think
how
some
day
he
would
be
at
them
and
break
their
lubberly
heads
there
were
thus
many
hours
when
he
turned
to
the
silent
consolations
of
the
chapel
so
familiar
had
he
grown
with
the
images
on
its
walls
that
he
had
a
name
for
every
one
the
king
the
knight
the
lady
the
children
with
basilisks
and
leopards
and
lastly
the
friend
as
he
called
saint
francis
an
lady
on
a
white
palfrey
with
gold
trappings
represented
his
mother
whom
he
had
seen
too
seldom
for
any
distinct
image
to
interfere
with
the
illusion
a
knight
in
damascened
armour
and
scarlet
cloak
was
the
valiant
captain
his
father
who
held
a
commission
in
the
ducal
army
and
a
proud
young
man
in
diadem
and
ermine
attended
by
a
retinue
of
pages
stood
for
his
cousin
the
reigning
duke
of
pianura
a
mist
as
usual
at
that
hour
was
rising
from
the
marshes
between
pontesordo
and
pianura
and
the
light
soon
ebbed
from
the
saint
face
leaving
the
chapel
in
obscurity
odo
had
crept
there
that
afternoon
with
a
keener
sense
than
usual
of
the
fact
that
life
was
hard
on
little
boys
and
though
he
was
cold
and
hungry
and
half
afraid
the
solitude
in
which
he
cowered
seemed
more
endurable
than
the
noisy
kitchen
where
at
that
hour
the
farm
hands
were
gathering
for
their
polenta
and
filomena
was
screaming
at
the
frightened
orphan
who
carried
the
dishes
to
the
table
he
knew
of
course
that
life
at
pontesordo
would
not
last
for
ever
that
in
time
he
would
grow
up
and
be
mysteriously
transformed
into
a
young
gentleman
with
a
sword
and
laced
coat
who
would
go
to
court
and
perhaps
be
an
officer
in
the
duke
army
or
in
that
of
some
neighbouring
prince
but
viewed
from
the
lowliness
of
his
nine
years
that
dazzling
prospect
was
too
remote
to
yield
much
solace
for
the
cuffs
and
sneers
the
ragged
shoes
and
sour
bread
of
the
present
the
fog
outside
had
thickened
and
the
face
of
odo
friend
was
now
discernible
only
as
a
spot
of
pallor
in
the
surrounding
dimness
even
he
seemed
farther
away
than
usual
withdrawn
into
the
fog
as
into
that
mist
of
indifference
which
lay
all
about
odo
hot
and
eager
spirit
the
child
sat
down
among
the
gourds
and
medlars
on
the
muddy
floor
and
hid
his
face
against
his
knees
he
had
sat
there
a
long
time
when
the
noise
of
wheels
and
the
crack
of
a
postillion
whip
roused
the
dogs
chained
in
the
stable
odo
heart
began
to
beat
what
could
the
sounds
mean
it
was
as
though
the
of
the
unknown
were
rising
about
him
and
bursting
open
the
chapel
door
to
pour
in
on
his
loneliness
it
was
in
fact
filomena
who
opened
the
door
crying
out
to
him
in
an
odd
easter
sunday
voice
the
voice
she
used
when
she
had
on
her
silk
neckerchief
and
gold
chain
or
when
she
was
talking
to
the
bailiff
odo
sprang
up
and
hid
his
face
in
her
lap
she
seemed
of
a
sudden
nearer
to
him
than
any
one
else
a
last
barrier
between
himself
and
the
mystery
that
awaited
him
outside
come
you
poor
sparrow
she
said
dragging
him
across
the
threshold
of
the
chapel
the
abate
is
here
asking
for
you
and
she
crossed
herself
as
though
she
had
named
a
saint
odo
pulled
away
from
her
with
a
last
wistful
glance
at
saint
francis
who
looked
back
at
him
in
an
ecstasy
of
commiseration
come
come
filomena
repeated
dropping
to
her
ordinary
key
as
she
felt
the
resistance
of
the
little
boy
hand
have
you
no
heart
you
wicked
child
but
to
be
sure
the
poor
innocent
does
know
come
cavaliere
your
illustrious
mother
waits
my
mother
the
blood
rushed
to
his
face
and
she
had
called
him
cavaliere
not
here
my
poor
lamb
the
abate
is
here
do
you
see
the
lights
of
the
carriage
there
there
go
to
him
i
have
told
him
your
reverence
it
my
silly
that
wo
let
me
always
been
like
one
of
my
own
creatures
to
me
and
she
confounded
odo
by
bursting
into
tears
the
abate
stood
on
the
doorstep
he
was
a
tall
stout
man
with
a
hooked
nose
and
lace
ruffles
his
nostrils
were
stained
with
snuff
and
he
took
a
pinch
from
a
box
set
with
the
miniature
of
a
lady
then
he
looked
down
at
odo
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
odo
was
growing
sick
with
apprehension
it
was
two
days
before
the
appointed
time
for
his
weekly
instruction
and
he
had
not
prepared
his
catechism
he
had
not
even
thought
of
it
and
the
abate
could
use
the
cane
odo
stood
silent
and
envied
girls
who
are
not
disgraced
by
crying
the
tears
were
in
his
throat
but
he
had
fixed
principles
about
crying
it
was
his
opinion
that
a
little
boy
who
was
a
cavaliere
might
weep
when
he
was
angry
or
sorry
but
never
when
he
was
afraid
so
he
held
his
head
high
and
put
his
hand
to
his
side
as
though
to
rest
it
on
his
sword
the
abate
sneezed
and
tapped
his
come
come
cavaliere
you
must
be
brave
you
must
be
a
man
you
have
duties
you
have
responsibilities
it
your
duty
to
console
your
mother
the
poor
lady
is
plunged
in
despair
eh
what
that
you
have
told
him
cavaliere
your
illustrious
father
is
no
more
odo
stared
a
moment
without
understanding
then
his
grief
burst
from
him
in
a
great
sob
and
he
hid
himself
against
filomena
apron
weeping
for
the
father
in
damascened
armour
and
scarlet
cloak
come
come
said
the
abate
impatiently
is
supper
laid
for
we
must
be
gone
as
soon
as
the
mist
rises
he
took
the
little
boy
by
the
hand
would
it
not
distract
your
mind
to
recite
the
catechism
he
inquired
no
no
cried
odo
with
redoubled
sobs
well
then
as
you
will
what
a
madman
he
exclaimed
to
filomena
i
warrant
it
has
seen
its
father
three
times
in
its
life
come
in
cavaliere
come
to
supper
filomena
had
laid
a
table
in
the
stone
chamber
known
as
the
parlour
and
thither
the
abate
dragged
his
charge
and
set
him
down
before
the
coarse
tablecloth
covered
with
earthen
platters
a
tallow
dip
threw
its
flare
on
the
abate
big
aquiline
face
as
he
sat
opposite
odo
gulping
the
hastily
prepared
frittura
and
the
thick
purple
wine
in
its
wicker
flask
odo
could
eat
nothing
the
tears
still
ran
down
his
cheeks
and
his
whole
soul
was
possessed
by
the
longing
to
steal
back
and
see
whether
the
figure
of
the
knight
in
the
scarlet
cloak
had
vanished
from
the
chapel
wall
the
abate
sat
in
silence
gobbling
his
food
like
the
old
black
pig
in
the
yard
when
he
had
finished
he
stood
up
exclaiming
death
comes
to
us
all
as
the
hawk
said
to
the
chicken
you
must
be
a
man
cavaliere
then
he
stepped
into
the
kitchen
and
called
out
for
the
horses
to
be
put
to
the
farm
hands
had
slunk
away
to
one
of
the
outhouses
and
filomena
and
jacopone
stood
bowing
and
curtseying
as
the
carriage
drew
up
at
the
kitchen
door
in
a
corner
of
the
big
vaulted
room
the
little
foundling
was
washing
the
dishes
heaping
the
scraps
in
a
bowl
for
herself
and
the
fowls
odo
ran
back
and
touched
her
arm
she
gave
a
start
and
looked
at
him
with
frightened
eyes
he
had
nothing
to
give
her
but
he
said
momola
and
he
thought
to
himself
that
when
he
was
grown
up
and
had
a
sword
he
would
surely
come
back
and
bring
her
a
pair
of
shoes
and
a
panettone
the
abate
was
calling
him
and
the
next
moment
he
found
himself
lifted
into
the
carriage
amid
the
blessings
and
lamentations
of
his
and
with
a
great
baying
of
dogs
and
clacking
of
whipcord
the
horses
clattered
out
of
the
farmyard
and
turned
their
heads
toward
pianura
the
mist
had
rolled
back
and
fields
and
vineyards
lay
bare
to
the
winter
moon
the
way
was
lonely
for
it
skirted
the
marsh
where
no
one
lived
and
only
here
and
there
the
tall
black
shadow
of
a
crucifix
ate
into
the
whiteness
of
the
road
shreds
of
vapour
still
hung
about
the
hollows
but
beyond
these
fold
on
fold
of
translucent
hills
melted
into
a
sky
dewy
with
stars
odo
cowered
in
his
corner
staring
out
awestruck
at
the
unrolling
of
the
strange
white
landscape
he
had
seldom
been
out
at
night
and
never
in
a
carriage
and
there
was
something
terrifying
to
him
in
this
flight
through
the
silent
fields
where
no
oxen
moved
in
the
furrows
no
peasants
pruned
the
mulberries
and
not
a
goat
bell
tinkled
among
the
oaks
he
felt
himself
alone
in
a
ghostly
world
from
which
even
the
animals
had
vanished
and
at
last
he
averted
his
eyes
from
the
dreadful
scene
and
sat
watching
the
abate
who
had
fixed
a
at
his
back
and
whose
shadow
as
the
springs
jolted
him
up
and
down
danced
overhead
like
the
huge
pulcinella
at
the
fair
of
pontesordo
the
gleam
of
a
lantern
woke
odo
the
horses
had
stopped
at
the
gates
of
pianura
and
the
abate
giving
the
the
carriage
rolled
under
the
gatehouse
and
continued
its
way
over
the
loud
of
the
ducal
streets
these
streets
were
so
dark
being
lit
but
by
some
lantern
projecting
here
and
there
from
the
angle
of
a
wall
or
by
the
flare
of
an
under
a
shrine
that
odo
leaning
eagerly
out
could
only
now
and
then
catch
a
sculptured
the
grinning
mask
on
the
keystone
of
an
archway
or
the
gleaming
yellowish
facade
of
a
church
inlaid
with
marbles
once
or
twice
an
uncurtained
window
showed
a
group
of
men
drinking
about
a
wineshop
table
or
an
artisan
bending
over
his
work
by
the
light
of
a
tallow
dip
but
for
the
most
part
doors
and
windows
were
barred
and
the
streets
disturbed
only
by
the
watchman
cry
or
by
a
flash
of
light
and
noise
as
a
sedan
chair
passed
with
its
escort
of
linkmen
and
servants
all
this
was
amazing
enough
to
the
sleepy
eyes
of
the
little
boy
so
unexpectedly
translated
from
the
solitude
of
pontesordo
but
when
the
carriage
turned
under
another
arch
and
drew
up
before
the
doorway
of
a
great
building
ablaze
with
lights
the
pressure
of
accumulated
emotions
made
him
fling
his
arms
about
his
neck
courage
cavaliere
courage
you
have
duties
you
have
responsibilities
the
abate
admonished
him
and
odo
choking
back
his
fright
suffered
himself
to
be
lifted
out
by
one
of
the
lacqueys
grouped
about
the
door
the
abate
who
carried
a
much
lower
crest
than
at
pontesordo
and
seemed
far
more
anxious
to
please
the
servants
than
they
to
oblige
him
led
the
way
up
a
shining
marble
staircase
where
beggars
whined
on
the
landings
and
powdered
footmen
in
the
ducal
livery
were
running
to
and
fro
with
trays
of
refreshments
odo
who
knew
that
his
mother
lived
in
the
duke
palace
had
vaguely
imagined
that
his
father
death
must
have
plunged
its
huge
precincts
into
silence
and
mourning
but
as
he
followed
the
abate
up
successive
flights
of
stairs
and
down
long
corridors
full
of
shadow
he
heard
a
sound
of
dance
music
below
and
caught
the
flash
of
girandoles
through
the
antechamber
doors
the
thought
that
his
father
death
had
made
no
difference
to
any
one
in
the
palace
was
to
the
child
so
much
more
astonishing
than
any
of
the
other
impressions
crowding
his
brain
that
these
were
scarcely
felt
and
he
passed
as
in
a
dream
through
rooms
where
servants
were
quarrelling
over
cards
and
rummaged
in
wardrobes
full
of
perfumed
finery
to
a
bedchamber
in
which
a
lady
dressed
in
weeds
sat
disconsolately
at
supper
mamma
mamma
he
cried
springing
forward
in
a
passion
of
tears
the
lady
who
was
young
pale
and
handsome
pushed
back
her
chair
with
a
warning
hand
child
she
exclaimed
your
shoes
are
covered
with
mud
and
good
heavens
how
you
smell
of
the
stable
abate
is
it
thus
you
teach
your
pupil
to
approach
me
madam
i
am
abashed
by
the
cavaliere
temerity
but
in
truth
i
believe
excessive
grief
has
clouded
his
wits
is
inconceivable
how
he
mourns
his
father
donna
laura
eyebrows
rose
in
a
faint
smile
may
he
never
have
worse
to
grieve
for
said
she
in
french
then
extending
her
scented
hand
to
the
little
boy
she
added
solemnly
my
son
we
have
suffered
an
irreparable
loss
odo
abashed
by
her
rebuke
and
the
abate
apology
had
drawn
his
heels
together
in
a
rustic
version
of
the
low
bow
with
which
the
children
of
that
day
were
taught
to
approach
their
parents
holy
virgin
said
his
mother
with
a
laugh
i
perceive
they
have
no
at
pontesordo
cavaliere
you
may
kiss
my
hand
so
that
better
we
shall
make
a
gentleman
of
you
yet
but
what
makes
your
face
so
wet
ah
crying
to
be
sure
mother
of
god
as
for
crying
there
enough
to
cry
about
she
put
the
child
aside
and
turned
to
the
preceptor
the
duke
refuses
to
pay
she
said
with
a
shrug
of
despair
good
heavens
lamented
the
abate
raising
his
hands
and
don
lelio
he
faltered
she
shrugged
again
impatiently
as
great
a
gambler
as
my
husband
they
all
alike
abate
six
times
since
last
easter
has
the
bill
been
sent
to
me
for
that
trifle
of
a
turquoise
buckle
he
made
such
a
about
giving
me
she
rose
and
began
to
pace
the
room
in
disorder
a
ruined
woman
she
cried
and
it
a
disgrace
for
the
duke
to
refuse
me
the
abate
raised
an
admonishing
finger
excellency
excellency
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
eh
you
right
everything
is
heard
here
but
who
to
pay
for
my
mourning
the
saints
alone
know
i
sent
an
express
this
morning
to
my
father
but
you
know
my
brothers
bleed
him
like
leeches
i
could
have
got
this
easily
enough
from
the
duke
a
year
ago
it
his
marriage
has
made
him
so
stiff
that
little
fool
she
hates
me
because
lelio
wo
look
at
her
and
she
thinks
it
my
fault
as
if
i
cared
whom
he
looks
at
sometimes
i
think
he
has
money
put
away
all
i
want
is
two
hundred
ducats
a
woman
of
my
rank
she
turned
suddenly
on
odo
who
stood
very
small
and
frightened
in
the
corner
to
which
she
had
pushed
him
what
are
you
staring
at
child
eh
the
monkey
is
dropping
with
sleep
look
at
his
eyes
abate
here
vanna
tonina
to
bed
with
him
he
may
sleep
with
you
in
my
tonina
go
with
her
child
go
but
for
god
sake
wake
him
if
he
snores
i
too
ill
to
have
my
rest
disturbed
and
she
lifted
a
pomander
to
her
nostrils
the
next
few
days
dwelt
in
odo
memory
as
a
blur
of
strange
sights
and
sounds
the
state
of
his
perceptions
was
succeeded
after
a
night
sleep
by
the
natural
passivity
with
which
children
accept
the
improbable
so
that
he
passed
from
one
novel
impression
to
another
as
easily
and
with
the
same
exhilaration
as
if
he
had
been
listening
to
a
fairy
tale
solitude
and
neglect
had
no
surprises
for
him
and
it
seemed
natural
enough
that
his
mother
and
her
maids
should
be
too
busy
to
remember
his
presence
for
the
first
day
or
two
he
sat
unnoticed
on
his
little
stool
in
a
corner
of
his
mother
room
while
were
dragged
in
wardrobes
emptied
and
milliners
consulted
and
troublesome
creditors
dismissed
with
abuse
or
even
blows
by
the
servants
lounging
in
the
donna
laura
continued
to
show
the
liveliest
symptoms
of
concern
but
the
child
perceived
her
distress
to
be
but
indirectly
connected
with
the
loss
she
had
suffered
and
he
had
seen
enough
of
poverty
at
the
farm
to
guess
that
the
need
of
money
was
somehow
at
the
bottom
of
her
troubles
how
any
one
could
be
in
want
who
slept
between
damask
curtains
and
lived
on
sweet
cakes
and
chocolate
it
exceeded
his
fancy
to
conceive
yet
there
were
times
when
his
voice
had
the
same
frightened
angry
sound
as
filomena
on
the
days
when
the
bailiff
went
over
the
accounts
at
pontesordo
her
excellency
rooms
during
these
days
were
always
crowded
for
besides
the
dressmakers
and
other
merchants
there
was
the
hairdresser
or
french
monsu
a
loud
important
figure
with
a
bag
full
of
cosmetics
and
the
abate
always
running
in
and
out
with
messages
and
letters
and
taking
no
more
notice
of
odo
than
if
he
had
never
seen
him
and
a
succession
of
ladies
brimming
with
condolences
and
each
followed
by
a
servant
who
swelled
the
noisy
crowd
of
lacqueys
in
the
through
all
these
figures
came
and
went
another
to
odo
the
most
noticeable
that
of
a
handsome
young
man
with
a
high
manner
dressed
always
in
black
but
with
an
excess
of
lace
ruffles
and
jewels
a
clouded
amber
head
to
his
cane
and
red
heels
to
his
shoes
this
young
gentleman
whose
age
could
not
have
been
more
than
twenty
and
who
had
the
coldest
insolent
air
was
treated
with
profound
respect
by
all
but
donna
laura
who
was
for
ever
quarrelling
with
him
when
he
was
present
yet
could
not
support
his
absence
without
lamentations
and
alarm
the
abate
appeared
to
act
as
messenger
between
the
two
and
when
he
came
to
say
that
the
count
rode
with
the
court
or
was
engaged
to
sup
with
the
prime
minister
or
had
business
on
his
father
estate
in
the
country
the
lady
would
openly
yield
to
her
distress
crying
out
that
she
knew
well
enough
what
his
excuses
meant
that
she
was
the
most
cruelly
outraged
of
women
and
that
he
treated
her
no
better
than
a
husband
for
two
days
odo
languished
in
his
corner
whisked
by
the
skirts
smothered
under
the
hoops
and
falbalas
which
the
dressmakers
unpacked
from
their
cases
fed
at
irregular
hours
and
faring
on
the
whole
no
better
than
at
pontesordo
the
third
morning
vanna
who
seemed
the
most
of
the
women
cried
out
on
his
pale
looks
when
she
brought
him
his
cup
of
chocolate
i
declare
she
exclaimed
the
child
has
had
no
air
since
he
came
in
from
the
farm
what
does
your
excellency
say
shall
the
hunchback
take
him
for
a
walk
in
the
gardens
to
this
her
excellency
who
sat
at
her
toilet
under
the
hands
irritably
replied
that
she
had
not
slept
all
night
and
was
in
no
state
to
be
tormented
about
such
trifles
but
that
the
child
might
go
where
he
pleased
odo
who
was
very
weary
of
his
corner
sprang
up
readily
enough
when
vanna
at
this
beckoned
him
to
the
inner
here
where
persons
of
a
certain
condition
waited
the
outer
being
given
over
to
servants
and
tradesmen
they
found
a
lean
humpbacked
boy
shabbily
dressed
in
darned
stockings
and
a
faded
coat
but
with
an
extraordinary
keen
pale
face
that
at
once
attracted
and
frightened
the
child
there
go
with
him
he
wo
eat
you
said
vanna
giving
him
a
push
as
she
hurried
away
and
odo
trembling
a
little
laid
his
hand
in
the
boy
where
do
you
come
from
he
faltered
looking
up
into
his
companion
face
the
boy
laughed
and
the
blood
rose
to
his
high
cheekbones
i
from
the
innocenti
if
your
excellency
knows
where
that
is
said
he
odo
face
lit
up
of
course
i
do
he
cried
reassured
i
know
a
girl
who
comes
from
there
the
momola
at
pontesordo
ah
indeed
said
the
boy
with
a
queer
look
well
she
my
sister
then
give
her
my
compliments
when
you
see
her
cavaliere
oh
we
a
large
family
we
are
odo
perplexity
was
returning
are
you
really
momola
brother
he
asked
eh
in
a
way
we
children
of
the
same
house
but
you
live
in
the
palace
do
you
odo
persisted
his
curiosity
surmounting
his
fear
are
you
a
servant
of
my
mother
i
the
servant
of
your
illustrious
mother
servants
the
abatino
of
the
i
write
their
do
you

cavaliere
i
carry
their
rubbish
to
the
pawnbroker
when
their
sweethearts
have
bled
them
of
their
savings
i
clean
the
birdcages
and
feed
the
monkeys
and
do
the
steward
accounts
when
he
drunk
and
sleep
on
a
bench
in
the
portico
and
steal
my
food
from
the
pantry
and
my
father
very
likely
goes
in
velvet
and
carries
a
sword
at
his
side
the
boy
voice
had
grown
shrill
and
his
eyes
blazed
like
an
owl
in
the
dark
odo
would
have
given
the
world
to
be
back
in
his
corner
but
he
was
ashamed
to
betray
his
lack
of
heart
and
to
give
himself
courage
he
asked
haughtily
and
what
is
your
name
boy
the
hunchback
gave
him
a
gleaming
look
call
me
brutus
he
cried
for
brutus
killed
a
tyrant
he
gave
odo
hand
a
pull
come
along
said
he
and
i
show
you
his
statue
in
the
garden
brutus
statue
in
a
prince
garden
mind
you
and
as
the
little
boy
trotted
at
his
side
down
the
long
corridors
he
kept
repeating
under
his
breath
in
a
kind
of
angry
for
brutus
killed
a
tyrant
the
sense
of
strangeness
inspired
by
his
odd
companion
soon
gave
way
in
odo
mind
to
emotions
of
delight
and
wonder
he
was
even
at
that
age
unusually
sensitive
to
external
impressions
and
when
the
hunchback
after
descending
many
stairs
and
winding
through
endless
at
length
led
him
out
on
a
terrace
above
the
gardens
the
beauty
of
the
sight
swelled
his
little
heart
to
bursting
a
duke
of
pianura
had
some
hundred
years
earlier
caused
a
great
wing
to
be
added
to
his
palace
by
the
eminent
architect
carlo
borromini
and
this
accomplished
designer
had
at
the
same
time
replanted
and
enlarged
the
ducal
gardens
to
odo
who
had
never
seen
plantations
more
artful
than
the
vineyards
and
mulberry
orchards
about
pontesordo
these
perspectives
of
clipped
beech
and
yew
these
knots
of
box
filled
in
with
sand
appeared
with
the
fountains
colonnades
and
trellised
arbours
surmounted
by
globes
of
glass
to
represent
the
very
pattern
and
paradise
of
gardens
it
seemed
indeed
too
beautiful
to
be
real
and
he
trembled
as
he
sometimes
did
at
the
music
of
the
easter
mass
when
the
hunchback
laughing
at
his
amazement
led
him
down
the
terrace
steps
it
was
odo
lot
in
after
years
to
walk
the
alleys
of
many
a
splendid
garden
and
to
pace
often
wearily
enough
the
paths
along
which
he
was
now
led
but
never
after
did
he
renew
the
first
enchanted
impression
of
mystery
and
brightness
that
remained
with
him
as
the
most
vivid
emotion
of
his
childhood
though
it
was
february
the
season
was
so
soft
that
the
orange
and
lemon
trees
had
been
put
out
in
their
earthen
vases
before
the
and
the
beds
in
the
parterres
were
full
of
violets
daffodils
and
auriculas
but
the
scent
of
the
and
the
bright
colours
of
the
flowers
moved
odo
less
than
the
noble
ordonnance
of
the
pleached
alleys
each
terminated
by
a
statue
or
a
marble
seat
and
when
he
came
to
the
grotto
where
amid
rearing
and
tritons
a
cascade
poured
from
the
grove
above
his
wonder
passed
into
such
delicious
awe
as
hung
him
speechless
on
the
hunchback
hand
eh
said
the
latter
with
a
sneer
it
a
finer
garden
than
we
have
at
our
family
palace
do
you
know
what
planted
there
he
asked
turning
suddenly
on
the
little
boy
dead
bodies
cavaliere
rows
and
rows
of
them
the
bodies
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
the
innocents
who
die
like
flies
every
year
of
the
cholera
and
the
measles
and
the
putrid
fever
he
saw
the
terror
in
odo
face
and
added
in
a
gentler
tone
eh
cry
cavaliere
they
sleep
better
in
those
beds
than
in
any
others
they
like
to
lie
on
come
come
and
i
show
your
excellency
the
aviaries
from
the
aviaries
they
passed
to
the
chinese
pavilion
where
the
duke
supped
on
summer
evenings
and
thence
to
the
the
and
the
at
every
step
some
fresh
surprise
arrested
odo
but
the
terrible
vision
of
that
other
garden
planted
with
the
dead
bodies
of
the
innocents
robbed
the
spectacle
of
its
brightness
dulled
the
plumage
of
the
birds
behind
their
gilt
wires
and
cast
a
deeper
shade
over
the
where
figures
of
men
lurked
balefully
in
the
twilight
odo
was
glad
when
they
left
the
blackness
of
this
grove
for
the
open
walks
where
gardeners
were
working
and
he
had
the
reassurance
of
the
sky
the
hunchback
who
seemed
sorry
that
he
had
frightened
him
told
him
many
curious
stories
about
the
marble
images
that
adorned
the
walks
and
pausing
suddenly
before
one
of
a
naked
man
with
a
knife
in
his
hand
cried
out
in
a
frenzy
this
is
my
namesake
brutus
but
when
odo
would
have
asked
if
the
naked
man
was
a
kinsman
the
boy
hurried
him
on
saying
only
you
read
of
him
some
day
in
plutarch
odo
next
morning
under
the
hunchback
guidance
continued
his
exploration
of
the
palace
his
mother
seemed
glad
to
be
rid
of
him
and
vanna
packing
him
off
early
with
the
warning
that
he
was
not
to
fall
into
the
fishponds
or
get
himself
trampled
by
the
horses
he
guessed
with
a
thrill
that
he
had
leave
to
visit
the
stables
here
in
fact
the
two
boys
were
soon
making
their
way
among
the
crowd
of
grooms
and
strappers
in
the
yard
seeing
the
duke
groomed
and
the
duchess
hackney
saddled
for
her
ride
in
the
chase
and
at
length
after
much
lingering
and
gazing
going
on
to
the
and
the
with
their
carved
and
gilt
wheels
their
panels
gay
with
flushed
divinities
and
their
stupendous
velvet
edged
with
bullion
held
odo
spellbound
he
had
a
born
taste
for
splendour
and
the
thought
that
he
might
one
day
sit
in
one
of
these
glittering
vehicles
puffed
his
breast
with
pride
and
made
him
address
the
hunchback
with
sudden
condescension
when
i
a
man
i
shall
ride
in
these
carriages
he
said
whereat
the
other
laughed
and
returned
eh
that
not
so
much
to
boast
of
cavaliere
i
shall
ride
in
a
carriage
one
of
these
days
myself
odo
stared
not
and
the
boy
added
when
i
carried
to
the
churchyard
i
mean
with
a
chuckle
of
relish
at
the
joke
from
the
stables
they
passed
to
the
with
its
open
galleries
supported
on
twisted
columns
where
the
duke
gentlemen
managed
their
horses
and
took
their
exercise
in
bad
weather
several
rode
there
that
morning
and
among
them
on
a
fine
arab
odo
recognised
the
young
man
in
black
velvet
who
was
so
often
in
donna
apartments
who
that
he
whispered
pulling
the
hunchback
sleeve
as
the
gentleman
just
below
them
made
his
horse
execute
a
brilliant
balotade
that
bless
the
innocent
why
the
count
lelio
trescorre
your
illustrious
mother
cavaliere
servente
odo
was
puzzled
but
some
instinct
of
reserve
withheld
him
from
further
questions
the
hunchback
however
had
no
such
scruples
they
do
say
though
he
went
on
that
her
highness
has
her
eye
on
him
and
in
that
case
i
wager
your
illustrious
mamma
has
no
more
chance
than
a
sparrow
against
a
hawk
the
boy
words
were
incomprehensible
but
the
vague
sense
that
some
danger
might
be
threatening
his
mother
friend
made
odo
whisper
what
would
her
highness
do
to
him
make
him
a
cavaliere
the
hunchback
laughed
odo
guide
it
appeared
was
not
privileged
to
conduct
him
through
the
state
apartments
of
the
palace
and
the
little
boy
had
now
been
four
days
under
the
ducal
roof
without
catching
so
much
as
a
glimpse
of
his
sovereign
and
cousin
the
very
next
morning
however
vanna
swept
him
from
his
with
the
announcement
that
he
was
to
be
received
by
the
duke
that
day
and
that
the
tailor
was
now
waiting
to
try
on
his
court
dress
he
found
his
mother
propped
against
her
pillows
drinking
chocolate
feeding
her
pet
monkey
and
giving
agitated
directions
to
the
maidservants
on
their
knees
before
the
open
her
excellency
informed
odo
that
she
had
that
moment
received
an
express
from
his
grandfather
the
old
marquess
di
donnaz
that
they
were
to
start
next
morning
for
the
castle
of
donnaz
and
that
he
was
to
be
presented
to
the
duke
as
soon
as
his
highness
had
risen
from
dinner
a
plump
purse
lay
on
the
coverlet
and
her
countenance
wore
an
air
of
kindness
and
animation
which
together
with
the
prospect
of
wearing
a
court
dress
and
travelling
to
his
grandfather
castle
in
the
mountains
so
worked
on
odo
spirits
that
forgetting
the
abate
instructions
he
sprang
to
her
with
an
eager
caress
child
child
was
her
only
rebuke
and
she
added
with
a
tap
on
his
cheek
it
is
lucky
i
shall
have
a
sword
to
protect
me
long
before
the
hour
odo
was
buttoned
into
his
embroidered
coat
and
waistcoat
he
would
have
on
the
sword
at
once
and
when
they
sat
down
to
dinner
though
his
mother
pressed
him
to
eat
with
more
concern
than
she
had
before
shown
it
went
hard
with
him
to
put
his
weapon
aside
and
he
cast
longing
eyes
at
the
corner
where
it
lay
at
length
a
chamberlain
summoned
them
and
they
set
out
down
the
corridors
attended
by
two
servants
odo
held
his
head
high
with
one
hand
leading
donna
laura
for
he
would
not
appear
to
be
led
by
her
while
the
other
fingered
his
sword
the
deformed
beggars
who
always
lurked
about
the
great
staircase
fawned
on
them
as
they
passed
and
on
a
landing
they
crossed
the
humpbacked
boy
who
grinned
mockingly
at
odo
but
the
latter
with
his
chin
up
would
not
so
much
as
glance
at
him
a
master
of
ceremonies
in
short
black
cloak
and
gold
chain
received
them
in
the
antechamber
of
the
duchess
apartments
where
the
court
played
lansquenet
after
dinner
the
doors
of
her
highness
closet
were
thrown
open
and
odo
now
glad
enough
to
cling
to
his
mother
hand
found
himself
in
a
tall
room
with
gods
and
goddesses
in
the
clouds
overhead
and
personages
as
seated
in
gilt
armchairs
about
a
smoking
brazier
before
one
of
these
to
whom
donna
laura
swept
successive
curtsies
in
advancing
the
frightened
cavaliere
found
himself
dragged
with
his
sword
between
his
legs
he
ducked
his
head
like
the
old
drake
diving
for
worms
in
the
puddle
at
the
farm
and
when
at
last
he
dared
look
up
it
was
to
see
an
odd
sallow
face
in
an
immense
wig
bowing
back
at
him
with
infinite
ceremony
and
odo
heart
sank
to
think
that
this
was
his
sovereign
the
duke
was
in
fact
a
sickly
young
man
with
thick
obstinate
lips
and
a
slight
lameness
that
made
his
walk
ungainly
but
though
no
way
resembling
the
king
of
the
chapel
at
pontesordo
he
yet
knew
how
to
put
on
a
certain
majesty
with
his
state
wig
and
his
orders
as
for
the
newly
married
duchess
who
sat
at
the
other
end
of
the
cabinet
caressing
a
toy
spaniel
she
was
scant
fourteen
and
looked
a
mere
child
in
her
great
hoop
and
jewelled
stomacher
her
wonderful
fair
hair
drawn
over
a
cushion
and
lightly
powdered
was
twisted
with
pearls
and
roses
and
her
cheeks
excessively
rouged
in
the
french
fashion
so
that
as
she
arose
on
the
approach
of
the
visitors
she
looked
to
odo
for
all
the
world
like
the
wooden
virgin
hung
with
votive
offerings
in
the
parish
church
at
pontesordo
though
they
were
but
three
months
married
the
duke
it
was
rumoured
was
never
with
her
preferring
the
company
of
the
young
marquess
of
cerveno
his
cousin
and
a
pale
boy
scented
with
musk
and
painted
like
a
comedian
whom
his
highness
would
never
suffer
away
from
him
and
who
now
leaned
with
an
impertinent
air
against
the
back
of
the
ducal
armchair
on
the
other
side
of
the
brazier
sat
the
dowager
duchess
the
grandmother
an
old
lady
so
high
and
forbidding
of
aspect
that
odo
cast
but
one
look
at
her
face
which
was
yellow
and
wrinkled
as
a
medlar
and
surmounted
in
the
spanish
style
with
black
veils
and
a
high
coif
what
these
alarming
personages
said
and
did
the
child
could
never
recall
nor
were
his
own
actions
clear
to
him
except
for
a
furtive
caress
that
he
remembered
giving
the
spaniel
as
he
kissed
the
duchess
hand
whereupon
her
highness
snatched
up
the
pampered
animal
and
walked
away
with
a
pout
of
anger
odo
noticed
that
her
angry
look
followed
him
as
he
and
donna
laura
withdrew
but
the
next
moment
he
heard
the
duke
voice
and
saw
his
highness
limping
after
them
you
must
have
a
furred
cloak
for
your
journey
cousin
said
he
awkwardly
pressing
something
in
the
hand
of
odo
mother
who
broke
into
fresh
compliments
and
curtsies
while
the
duke
with
a
finger
on
his
thick
lip
withdrew
hastily
into
the
closet
the
next
morning
early
they
set
out
on
their
journey
there
had
been
frost
in
the
night
and
a
cold
sun
sparkled
on
the
palace
windows
and
on
the
marble
as
their
carriage
lumbered
through
the
streets
now
full
of
noise
and
animation
it
was
odo
first
glimpse
of
the
town
by
daylight
and
he
clapped
his
hands
with
delight
at
sight
of
the
people
picking
their
way
across
the
reeking
gutters
the
asses
laden
with
milk
and
vegetables
the
bargaining
at
the
the
wives
going
to
mass
in
pattens
and
hoods
with
scaldini
in
their
muffs
the
dark
recessed
openings
in
the
palace
basements
where
fruit
sellers
and
coppersmiths
displayed
their
wares
the
pedlars
hawking
books
and
toys
and
here
and
there
a
gentleman
in
a
sedan
chair
returning
flushed
and
disordered
from
a
night
at
bassett
or
faro
the
was
escorted
by
of
the
duke
troopers
and
don
lelio
rode
at
the
door
followed
by
two
grooms
he
wore
a
furred
coat
and
boots
and
never
to
odo
had
he
appeared
more
proud
and
splendid
but
donna
laura
had
hardly
a
word
for
him
and
he
rode
with
the
set
air
of
a
man
who
acquits
himself
of
a
troublesome
duty
outside
the
gates
the
spectacle
seemed
tame
in
comparison
for
the
road
bent
toward
pontesordo
and
odo
was
familiar
enough
with
the
look
of
the
bare
fields
set
here
and
there
with
to
which
the
leaves
still
clung
as
the
carriage
skirted
the
marsh
his
mother
raised
the
windows
exclaiming
that
they
must
not
expose
themselves
to
the
pestilent
air
and
though
odo
was
not
yet
addicted
to
general
reflections
he
could
not
but
wonder
that
she
should
display
such
dread
of
an
atmosphere
she
had
let
him
breathe
since
his
birth
he
knew
of
course
that
the
sunset
vapours
on
the
marsh
were
unhealthy
everybody
on
the
farm
had
a
touch
of
the
ague
and
it
was
a
saying
in
the
village
that
no
one
lived
at
pontesordo
who
could
buy
an
ass
to
carry
him
away
but
that
donna
laura
in
skirting
the
place
on
a
clear
morning
of
frost
should
show
such
fear
of
infection
gave
a
sinister
emphasis
to
the
of
the
region
the
thought
he
knew
not
why
turned
his
mind
to
momola
who
often
on
damp
evenings
sat
shaking
and
burning
in
the
kitchen
corner
he
reflected
with
a
pang
that
he
might
never
see
her
again
and
leaning
forward
he
strained
his
eyes
for
a
glimpse
of
pontesordo
they
were
passing
through
a
patch
of
oaks
but
where
these
ended
the
country
opened
and
beyond
a
belt
of
osiers
and
the
mottled
faded
stretches
of
the
marsh
the
keep
stood
up
like
a
beckoning
finger
odo
cried
out
as
though
in
answer
to
its
call
but
that
moment
the
road
turned
a
knoll
and
bent
across
rising
ground
toward
an
unfamiliar
region
thank
god
cried
his
mother
lowering
the
window
we
rid
of
that
poison
and
can
breath
the
air
as
the
keep
vanished
odo
reproached
himself
for
not
having
begged
a
pair
of
shoes
for
momola
he
had
felt
very
sorry
for
her
since
the
hunchback
had
spoken
so
strangely
of
life
at
the
foundling
hospital
and
he
had
a
sudden
vision
of
her
bare
feet
pinched
with
cold
and
cut
with
the
pebbles
of
the
yard
perpetually
running
across
the
damp
stone
floors
with
filomena
crying
after
her
hasten
then
child
of
iniquity
you
are
slower
than
a
day
without
bread
he
had
almost
resolved
to
speak
of
the
foundling
to
his
mother
who
still
seemed
in
a
condescending
humour
but
his
attention
was
unexpectedly
distracted
by
a
troop
of
egyptians
who
came
along
the
road
leading
a
dancing
bear
and
hardly
had
these
passed
when
the
chariot
of
an
itinerant
dentist
engaged
him
the
whole
way
indeed
was
alive
with
such
surprises
and
at
valsecca
where
they
dined
they
found
the
yard
of
the
inn
crowded
with
the
and
servants
of
a
cardinal
travelling
to
rome
who
was
to
lie
there
that
night
and
whose
bedstead
and
saucepans
had
preceded
him
here
after
dinner
don
lelio
took
leave
of
odo
mother
with
small
show
of
regret
on
either
side
the
lady
high
and
sarcastic
the
gentleman
sullen
and
polite
and
both
as
it
seemed
easier
when
the
business
was
despatched
and
the
count
foot
in
the
stirrup
he
had
so
far
taken
little
notice
of
odo
but
he
now
bent
from
the
saddle
and
tapped
the
boy
cheek
saying
in
his
cold
way
in
a
few
years
i
shall
see
you
at
court
and
with
that
rode
away
toward
pianura
lying
that
night
at
pavia
the
travellers
set
forward
next
morning
for
the
city
of
vercelli
the
road
though
it
ran
for
the
most
part
through
flat
mulberry
orchards
and
reflecting
the
pale
blue
sky
in
their
sodden
channels
would
yet
have
appeared
diverting
enough
to
odo
had
his
mother
been
in
the
mood
to
reply
to
his
questions
for
whether
their
carriage
overtook
a
party
of
strolling
jugglers
travelling
in
a
waggon
with
the
younger
children
of
the
company
running
alongside
in
threadbare
tights
and
trunkhose
decked
with
tinsel
or
whether
they
drove
through
a
village
where
yellow
earthen
crocks
and
gaudy
indian
cottons
brass
pails
and
braziers
and
platters
of
bluish
pewter
filled
the
stalls
with
a
medley
of
colour
at
every
turn
was
something
that
excited
the
boy
wonder
but
donna
laura
who
had
fallen
into
a
depression
of
spirits
lamenting
the
cold
her
misfortunes
and
the
discomfort
of
the
journey
was
at
no
more
pains
than
the
abate
to
satisfy
the
promptings
of
his
curiosity
odo
had
indeed
met
but
one
person
who
cared
to
listen
to
him
and
that
was
the
strange
hunchback
who
had
called
himself
brutus
remembering
how
entertainingly
this
odd
guide
had
explained
all
the
wonders
of
the
ducal
grounds
odo
began
to
regret
that
he
had
not
asked
his
mother
to
let
him
have
brutus
for
a
meanwhile
no
one
attended
to
his
questions
and
the
hours
were
beginning
to
seem
long
when
on
the
third
day
they
set
out
from
vercelli
toward
the
hills
the
cold
increased
as
they
rose
and
odo
though
he
had
often
wished
to
see
the
mountains
was
yet
dismayed
at
the
gloomy
and
menacing
aspect
of
the
region
on
which
they
were
entering
leafless
woods
prodigious
boulders
and
white
torrents
foaming
and
roaring
seemed
a
poor
exchange
for
the
gardens
of
pianura
here
were
no
violets
and
cowslips
in
bloom
hardly
a
green
blade
pierced
the
sodden
roadside
and
snowdrifts
lingered
in
the
shaded
hollows
donna
laura
loudly
expressed
fear
of
robbers
seemed
to
increase
the
loneliness
of
the
way
which
now
traversed
tracts
of
naked
moorland
now
plunged
again
into
forest
with
no
sign
of
habitation
but
here
and
there
a
cowherd
hut
under
the
trees
or
a
chapel
standing
apart
on
some
grassy
eminence
when
night
fell
the
waters
grew
louder
a
stinging
wind
swept
the
woods
and
the
carriage
staggering
from
rut
to
rut
seemed
every
moment
about
to
land
them
in
some
invisible
ravine
fear
and
cold
at
last
benumbed
the
little
boy
and
when
he
woke
he
was
being
lifted
from
his
seat
and
torches
were
flashing
on
a
high
escutcheoned
doorway
set
in
battlemented
walls
he
was
carried
into
a
hall
lit
with
smoky
and
hung
with
armour
and
torn
banners
here
among
a
group
of
servants
a
tall
old
man
in
a
nightcap
and
furred
gown
was
giving
orders
in
a
loud
passionate
voice
this
personage
who
was
of
a
choleric
complexion
with
a
face
like
mottled
red
marble
seized
odo
by
the
wrist
and
led
him
up
a
flight
of
stairs
so
worn
and
slippery
that
he
tripped
at
every
step
thence
down
a
corridor
and
into
a
gloomy
apartment
where
three
ladies
shivered
about
a
table
set
with
candles
bidden
by
the
old
gentleman
to
salute
his
grandmother
and
odo
bowed
over
three
wrinkled
hands
one
fat
and
soft
as
a
toad
stomach
the
others
yellow
and
dry
as
his
mother
embraced
the
ladies
in
the
same
humble
manner
and
the
marquess
first
furiously
calling
for
supper
thrust
odo
down
on
a
stool
in
the
ingle
from
this
point
of
observation
the
child
now
vividly
awake
noted
the
hangings
of
faded
tapestry
that
heaved
in
the
draught
the
ceiling
of
beams
and
the
stone
floor
strewn
with
rushes
the
flickering
on
the
faces
of
his
aged
relatives
showed
his
grandmother
to
be
a
pale
person
with
little
watchful
black
eyes
which
she
dropped
at
her
husband
approach
while
the
two
seated
side
by
side
in
chairs
with
their
feet
on
braziers
reminded
odo
of
the
narrow
elongated
saints
squeezed
into
the
niches
of
a
the
old
marchioness
wore
the
high
coif
and
veil
of
the
previous
century
the
aunts
who
as
odo
afterwards
learned
were
canonesses
of
a
noble
order
were
habited
in
a
dress
with
crosses
hanging
on
their
bosoms
and
none
spoke
but
when
the
marquess
addressed
them
their
timidity
appeared
to
infect
odo
mother
who
from
her
habitual
volubility
of
temper
sank
to
a
mood
of
like
submissiveness
a
supper
of
venison
and
goat
cheese
was
not
designed
to
restore
her
spirits
and
when
at
length
she
and
odo
had
withdrawn
to
their
cavernous
bedchamber
she
flung
herself
weeping
on
the
bed
and
declared
she
must
die
if
she
remained
long
in
this
prison
falling
asleep
under
such
influences
it
was
the
more
wonderful
to
odo
to
wake
with
the
sun
on
his
counterpane
a
sweet
noise
of
streams
through
the
casement
and
the
joyous
barking
of
hounds
in
the
castle
court
from
the
he
looked
out
on
a
scene
extraordinarily
novel
to
his
lowland
eyes
the
chamber
commanded
the
wooded
steep
below
the
castle
with
a
stream
looping
its
base
beyond
the
pastures
sloped
pleasantly
under
walnut
trees
with
here
and
there
a
clearing
ploughed
for
the
spring
crops
and
a
sunny
ledge
or
two
planted
with
vines
above
this
pastoral
landscape
bare
crags
upheld
a
snowpeak
and
as
if
to
lend
a
human
interest
to
the
scene
the
old
marquess
his
flintlock
on
his
shoulder
his
dogs
and
beaters
at
his
heels
now
rode
across
the
valley
wonder
succeeded
to
wonder
that
first
morning
for
there
was
the
castle
to
be
seen
with
the
kennels
and
stables
roughly
kept
but
full
of
dogs
and
horses
and
odo
in
the
marquess
absence
was
left
free
to
visit
every
nook
of
his
new
home
pontesordo
though
perhaps
as
ancient
as
donnaz
was
but
a
fortified
manor
in
the
plain
but
here
was
the
turreted
border
castle
bristling
at
the
head
of
the
gorge
like
the
fangs
in
a
boar
throat
its
walls
overhung
by
machicolations
its
portcullis
still
dropped
at
nightfall
and
the
loud
stream
forming
a
natural
moat
at
its
base
through
the
desert
spaces
of
this
great
structure
odo
wandered
at
will
losing
himself
in
its
network
of
bare
chambers
some
now
put
to
domestic
uses
with
smoked
meats
hanging
from
the
rafters
cheeses
ranged
on
shelves
and
farmer
implements
stacked
on
the
floor
others
abandoned
to
bats
and
spiders
with
openings
choked
by
a
growth
of
wild
cherries
and
little
animals
scurrying
into
their
holes
as
odo
opened
the
unused
doors
at
the
next
turn
he
mounted
by
a
winding
stair
to
the
platform
behind
the
battlements
whence
he
could
look
down
on
the
inner
court
where
horses
were
being
groomed
dogs
fed
harnesses
mended
and
platters
of
smoking
food
carried
from
the
kitchen
to
the
pantry
or
leaning
another
way
discovered
between
the
cliff
and
the
rampart
a
tiny
walled
garden
with
and
a
sundial
the
ladies
kept
to
themselves
in
a
corner
of
the
castle
where
the
rooms
were
hung
with
tapestry
and
a
few
chairs
stood
about
the
hearth
but
even
here
no
fires
were
suffered
till
nightfall
nor
was
there
so
much
as
a
carpet
in
the
castle
odo
grandmother
the
old
marchioness
a
heavy
woman
who
would
doubtless
have
enjoyed
her
ease
in
a
cushioned
seat
was
afoot
all
day
attending
to
her
household
for
besides
the
dairy
and
the
bakehouse
and
the
stillroom
where
fruits
were
stewed
and
pastes
prepared
there
was
the
great
full
of
distaffs
and
looms
where
the
women
spun
and
wove
all
the
linen
used
in
the
castle
and
the
coarse
stuffs
worn
by
its
inmates
with
workshops
for
the
cobbler
and
tailor
who
clothed
and
shod
the
marquess
and
his
household
all
these
the
marchioness
must
visit
and
attend
to
her
devotions
between
the
ladies
being
governed
by
a
priest
their
chaplain
and
director
who
kept
them
perpetually
running
along
the
cold
stone
corridors
to
the
chapel
in
a
distant
wing
where
they
knelt
without
so
much
as
a
brazier
to
warm
them
or
a
cushion
to
their
knees
as
to
the
chapel
though
larger
and
loftier
than
that
of
pontesordo
with
a
fine
carved
and
painted
tabernacle
and
many
silver
candlesticks
it
seemed
to
odo
by
reason
of
its
bare
walls
much
less
beautiful
than
that
deserted
oratory
nor
did
he
amid
all
the
novelty
of
his
surroundings
cease
to
regret
the
companionship
of
his
familiar
images
his
delight
was
the
greater
therefore
when
exploring
a
part
of
the
castle
now
quite
abandoned
he
came
one
day
on
a
vaulted
chamber
used
as
a
kind
of
granary
where
under
layers
of
dirt
and
cobwebs
lovely
countenances
flowered
from
the
walls
the
scenes
depicted
differed
indeed
from
those
of
pontesordo
being
less
animated
and
homely
and
more
difficult
for
a
child
to
interpret
for
here
were
naked
knights
on
prancing
horses
nimble
creatures
grouped
in
adoration
round
a
smoking
altar
and
youths
piping
to
damsels
on
set
with
poplars
the
very
strangeness
of
the
fable
set
forth
perhaps
engaged
the
child
fancy
or
the
benignant
mildness
of
the
countenances
so
unlike
the
eager
individual
faces
of
the
earlier
artist
for
he
returned
again
and
again
to
gaze
unweariedly
on
the
inhabitants
of
that
tranquil
grassy
world
studying
every
inch
of
the
walls
and
with
much
awe
and
fruitless
speculation
deciphering
on
the
hem
of
a
floating
drapery
the
inscription
bernardinus
lovinus
pinxit
his
impatience
to
know
more
of
the
history
of
these
paintings
led
him
to
question
an
old
man
half
half
huntsman
now
too
infirm
for
service
and
often
to
be
found
sunning
himself
in
the
court
with
an
old
hound
chin
on
his
knee
the
old
man
whose
name
was
bruno
told
him
the
room
in
question
had
been
painted
for
the
marquess
gualberto
di
donnaz
who
had
fought
under
the
duke
of
milan
hundreds
of
years
before
a
splendid
and
hospitable
noble
patron
of
learning
and
the
arts
who
had
brought
the
great
milanese
painter
to
donnaz
and
kept
him
there
a
whole
summer
adorning
the
but
i
advise
you
little
master
bruno
added
not
to
talk
too
loudly
of
your
discovery
for
we
live
in
changed
days
do
you
see
and
it
seems
those
are
pagan
sorcerers
and
witches
painted
on
the
wall
and
because
of
that
and
their
nakedness
the
chaplain
has
forbidden
all
the
young
boys
and
wenches
about
the
place
to
set
foot
there
and
the
marchioness
herself
told
does
enter
without
leave
this
was
the
more
puzzling
to
odo
that
he
had
seen
so
many
naked
pagans
in
colours
and
marble
at
his
cousin
palace
of
pianura
where
they
were
praised
as
the
chief
ornament
of
that
sumptuous
fabric
but
he
kept
bruno
warning
in
mind
and
so
timed
his
visits
that
they
escaped
the
chaplain
observation
whether
this
touch
of
mystery
added
charm
to
the
paintings
or
whether
there
was
already
forming
in
him
what
afterward
became
an
instinctive
resistance
to
many
of
the
dictates
of
his
age
certain
it
is
that
even
after
he
had
been
privileged
to
admire
the
stupendous
works
of
the
caracci
at
parma
and
of
the
immortal
giulio
romano
at
mantua
odo
fancy
always
turned
with
peculiar
fondness
to
the
youths
moving
in
that
world
of
untroubled
beauty
odo
the
day
after
his
arrival
at
donnaz
learned
that
the
chaplain
was
to
be
his
governor
and
he
was
not
long
in
discovering
that
the
system
of
that
ecclesiastic
bore
no
resemblance
to
the
desultory
methods
of
his
former
pedagogue
it
was
not
that
don
gervaso
was
a
man
of
superior
acquirements
in
writing
ciphering
and
the
rudiments
of
latin
he
seemed
little
likely
to
carry
odo
farther
than
the
other
but
in
religious
instruction
he
suffered
no
negligence
or
inattention
his
piety
was
of
a
stamp
so
different
from
the
abate
that
it
vivified
the
theological
abstractions
over
which
odo
had
formerly
languished
infusing
a
passionate
meaning
into
the
formulas
of
the
textbooks
his
discourse
breathed
the
same
spirit
and
had
his
religion
been
warmed
by
imagination
or
tempered
by
charity
the
child
had
been
a
ductile
substance
in
his
hands
but
the
shadow
of
the
council
of
trent
still
hung
over
the
church
in
savoy
making
its
approach
almost
as
sombre
and
forbidding
as
that
of
the
calvinist
heresy
as
it
was
the
fascination
that
drew
odo
to
the
divine
teachings
was
counteracted
by
a
depressing
awe
he
trembled
in
god
presence
almost
as
much
as
in
his
grandfather
and
with
the
same
despair
of
discovering
what
course
of
action
was
most
likely
to
call
down
the
impending
wrath
the
beauty
of
the
church
offices
now
for
the
first
time
revealed
to
him
in
the
services
of
the
chapel
was
doubly
moving
in
contrast
with
the
rude
life
at
donnaz
but
his
confessions
tortured
him
and
the
penances
which
the
chaplain
inflicted
abased
without
reforming
his
spirit
next
to
the
mass
the
books
don
gervaso
lent
him
were
his
chief
pleasure
the
lives
of
the
saints
cardinal
bellarmine
fables
and
the
mirror
of
true
penitence
the
lives
of
the
saints
fed
at
once
his
imagination
and
his
heart
and
over
the
story
of
saint
francis
now
first
made
known
to
him
he
trembled
with
delicious
sympathy
the
longing
to
found
a
hermitage
like
the
portiuncula
among
the
savage
rocks
of
donnaz
and
live
there
in
gentle
communion
with
plants
and
animals
alternated
in
him
with
the
martial
ambition
to
ride
forth
against
the
church
enemies
as
his
ancestors
had
ridden
against
the
bloody
and
pestilent
waldenses
but
whether
his
piety
took
the
passive
or
the
aggressive
form
it
always
shrank
from
the
subtleties
of
doctrine
to
live
like
the
saints
rather
than
to
reason
like
the
fathers
was
his
ideal
of
christian
conduct
if
indeed
a
vague
pity
for
suffering
creatures
and
animals
was
not
the
source
of
his
monastic
yearnings
and
a
desire
to
see
strange
countries
the
secret
of
his
zeal
against
the
infidel
the
chaplain
though
reproving
his
lukewarmness
in
matters
of
dogma
could
not
but
commend
his
devotion
to
the
saints
and
one
day
his
grandmother
to
reward
him
for
some
act
of
piety
informed
him
with
tears
of
joy
that
he
was
destined
for
holy
orders
and
that
she
had
good
hopes
of
living
to
see
him
a
bishop
this
news
had
hardly
the
intended
effect
for
odo
dream
was
of
the
saint
halo
rather
than
the
mitre
and
throwing
himself
on
his
knees
before
the
old
marquess
who
was
present
he
besought
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
join
the
franciscan
order
the
marquess
at
this
flew
into
so
furious
a
rage
cursing
the
meddlesomeness
of
women
and
the
chaplain
bigotry
that
the
ladies
burst
into
tears
and
odo
swelling
zeal
turned
small
there
was
indeed
but
one
person
in
the
castle
who
seemed
not
to
regard
its
violences
and
that
was
the
chaplain
who
when
the
marquess
had
paused
out
of
breath
tranquilly
returned
that
nothing
could
make
him
repent
of
having
brought
a
soul
to
christ
and
that
as
to
the
cavaliere
odo
if
his
maker
designed
him
for
a
religious
the
pope
himself
could
not
cross
his
vocation
ay
ay
vocation
snarled
the
marquess
you
and
the
women
here
shut
the
child
up
between
you
and
stuff
his
ears
full
of
monkish
stories
and
miracles
and
the
lord
knows
what
and
then
talk
of
the
vocation
his
vocation
nom
de
dieu
is
to
be
an
abbot
first
and
then
a
monsignore
and
then
a
bishop
if
he
can
and
to
the
devil
with
your
cowls
and
cloisters
and
he
gave
orders
that
odo
should
hunt
with
him
next
morning
the
chaplain
smiled
hubert
was
a
huntsman
said
he
and
yet
he
died
a
saint
from
that
time
forth
the
old
marquess
kept
odo
oftener
at
his
side
making
his
grandson
ride
with
him
about
his
estates
and
on
such
as
were
not
beyond
the
boy
strength
the
domain
of
donnaz
included
many
a
mile
of
vine
and
forest
over
which
till
the
fifteenth
century
its
lords
had
ruled
as
sovereign
marquesses
they
still
retained
a
part
of
their
feudal
privileges
and
odo
grandfather
tenacious
of
these
dwindling
rights
was
for
ever
engaged
in
vain
contests
with
his
peasantry
to
see
these
poor
creatures
cursed
and
their
least
offences
punished
their
few
claims
disputed
must
have
turned
odo
fear
of
his
grandfather
to
hatred
had
he
not
observed
that
the
old
man
gave
with
one
hand
what
he
took
with
the
other
so
that
in
his
dealings
with
his
people
he
resembled
one
of
those
torrents
which
now
devastate
and
now
enrich
their
banks
the
marquess
in
fact
while
he
held
obstinately
to
his
fishing
rights
prosecuted
poachers
enforced
the
corvee
and
took
toll
at
every
ford
yet
laboured
to
improve
his
lands
exterminated
the
wild
beasts
that
preyed
on
them
helped
his
peasants
in
sickness
nourished
them
in
old
age
and
governed
them
with
a
paternal
tyranny
doubtless
less
insufferable
than
the
negligence
of
the
great
who
lived
at
court
to
odo
however
these
rides
among
the
tenantry
were
less
agreeable
than
the
which
carried
them
up
the
mountain
in
the
solitude
of
morning
here
the
wild
freshness
of
the
scene
and
the
exhilaration
of
pursuit
roused
the
fighting
strain
in
the
boy
blood
and
so
stirred
his
memory
with
tales
of
prowess
that
sometimes
as
they
climbed
the
stony
defiles
in
the
clear
shadow
before
sunrise
he
fancied
himself
riding
forth
to
exterminate
the
waldenses
who
according
to
the
chaplain
still
lurked
like
basilisks
and
dragons
in
the
recesses
of
the
mountains
certain
it
is
that
his
rides
with
the
old
marquess
if
they
inflamed
his
zeal
against
heresy
cooled
the
ardour
of
his
monastic
vocation
and
if
he
pondered
on
his
future
it
was
to
reflect
that
doubtless
he
would
some
day
be
a
bishop
and
that
bishops
were
territorial
lords
we
might
hunt
the
wolf
and
boar
in
their
own
domains
reluctantly
every
year
about
the
epiphany
the
old
marquess
rode
down
from
donnaz
to
spend
two
months
in
turin
it
was
a
service
exacted
by
king
charles
emanuel
who
viewed
with
a
jealous
eye
those
of
his
nobles
inclined
to
absent
themselves
from
court
and
rewarded
their
presence
with
privileges
and
preferments
at
the
same
time
the
two
canonesses
descended
to
their
abbey
in
the
plain
and
thus
with
the
closing
in
of
winter
the
old
marchioness
odo
and
his
mother
were
left
alone
in
the
castle
to
the
marchioness
this
was
an
agreeable
period
of
spiritual
compunction
and
bodily
repose
but
to
donna
laura
a
season
of
despair
the
poor
lady
who
had
been
early
removed
from
the
rough
life
at
donnaz
to
the
luxurious
court
of
pianura
and
was
yet
in
the
fulness
of
youth
and
vivacity
could
not
resign
herself
to
an
existence
no
better
as
she
declared
than
that
of
any
herdsman
wife
upon
the
mountains
here
was
neither
music
nor
cards
scandal
nor
no
news
of
the
fashions
no
visits
from
or
jewellers
no
monsu
to
curl
her
hair
and
tempt
her
with
new
lotions
or
so
much
as
a
strolling
soothsayer
or
juggler
to
lighten
the
dullness
of
the
long
afternoons
the
only
visitors
to
the
castle
were
the
mendicant
friars
drawn
thither
by
the
marchioness
pious
repute
and
though
donna
laura
disdained
not
to
call
these
to
her
chamber
and
question
them
for
news
yet
their
scandals
were
no
more
to
her
fancy
than
the
wares
of
the
chapmen
who
unpacked
their
baubles
on
the
kitchen
hearth
she
pined
for
some
word
of
pianura
but
when
a
young
abate
who
had
touched
there
on
his
way
from
tuscany
called
for
a
night
at
the
castle
to
pay
his
duty
to
don
gervaso
the
word
he
brought
with
him
of
the
birth
of
an
heir
to
the
duchy
was
so
little
to
donna
laura
humour
that
she
sprang
up
from
the
and
crying
out
to
the
astonished
odo
ah
now
you
are
for
the
church
indeed
withdrew
in
disorder
to
her
chamber
the
abate
who
ascribed
her
commotion
to
a
sudden
seizure
continued
to
retail
the
news
of
pianura
and
odo
listening
with
his
elders
learned
that
count
lelio
trescorre
had
been
appointed
master
of
the
horse
to
the
indignation
of
the
bishop
who
desired
the
place
for
his
nephew
don
serafino
that
the
duke
and
duchess
were
never
together
that
the
duchess
was
suspected
of
being
in
secret
correspondence
with
the
austrians
and
that
the
young
marquess
of
cerveno
was
gone
to
the
baths
of
lucca
to
recover
from
an
attack
of
tertian
fever
contracted
the
previous
autumn
at
the
duke
near
pontesordo
odo
listened
for
some
mention
of
his
humpbacked
friend
or
of
momola
the
foundling
but
the
abate
talk
kept
a
higher
level
and
no
one
less
than
a
cavaliere
figured
on
his
lips
he
was
the
only
visitor
of
quality
who
came
that
winter
to
donnaz
and
after
his
departure
a
fixed
gloom
settled
on
donna
laura
spirits
dusk
at
that
season
fell
early
in
the
gorge
fierce
winds
blew
off
the
glaciers
and
donna
laura
sat
shivering
and
lamenting
on
one
side
of
the
hearth
while
the
old
marchioness
on
the
other
strained
her
eyes
over
an
embroidery
in
which
the
pattern
repeated
itself
like
the
invocations
of
a
litany
and
don
gervaso
near
the
smoking
read
aloud
from
the
glories
of
mary
or
the
way
of
perfection
of
saint
theresa
on
such
evenings
odo
stealing
from
the
tapestry
parlour
would
seek
out
bruno
who
sat
by
the
kitchen
hearth
with
the
old
hound
nose
at
his
feet
the
kitchen
indeed
on
winter
nights
was
the
pleasantest
place
in
the
castle
the
from
its
great
stone
chimney
shone
on
the
strings
of
maize
and
bunches
of
dried
vegetables
that
hung
from
the
roof
and
on
the
copper
kettles
and
saucepans
ranged
along
the
wall
the
wind
raged
against
the
shutters
of
the
unglazed
windows
and
the
distaff
in
hand
crowded
closer
to
the
blaze
listening
to
the
songs
of
some
wandering
fiddler
or
to
the
stories
of
a
capuchin
monk
who
was
being
regaled
by
the
orders
on
a
supper
of
tripe
and
mulled
wine
the
capuchin
tales
told
in
the
piedmontese
jargon
and
seasoned
with
strange
allusions
and
boisterous
laughter
were
of
little
interest
to
odo
who
would
creep
into
the
ingle
beside
bruno
and
beg
for
some
story
of
his
ancestors
the
old
man
was
never
weary
of
rehearsing
the
feats
and
gestures
of
the
lords
of
donnaz
and
odo
heard
again
and
again
how
they
had
fought
the
savage
switzers
north
of
the
alps
and
the
dauphin
men
in
the
west
how
they
had
marched
with
savoy
against
montferrat
and
with
france
against
the
republic
of
genoa
better
still
he
liked
to
hear
of
the
marquess
gualberto
who
had
been
the
duke
of
milan
ally
and
had
brought
home
the
great
milanese
painter
to
adorn
his
at
donnaz
the
lords
of
donnaz
had
never
been
noted
for
learning
and
odo
grandfather
was
fond
of
declaring
that
a
nobleman
need
not
be
a
scholar
but
the
great
marquess
gualberto
if
himself
unlettered
had
been
the
patron
of
poets
and
painters
and
had
kept
learned
clerks
to
write
down
the
annals
of
his
house
on
parchment
painted
by
the
monks
these
annals
were
locked
in
the
archives
under
don
gervaso
care
but
odo
learned
from
the
old
servant
that
some
of
the
great
marquess
books
had
lain
for
years
on
an
upper
shelf
in
the
vestry
off
the
chapel
and
here
one
day
with
aid
the
little
boy
dislodged
from
a
corner
behind
the
missals
and
certain
sheepskin
volumes
clasped
in
blackened
silver
the
comeliest
of
these
which
bore
on
their
a
dolphin
curled
about
an
anchor
were
printed
in
unknown
characters
but
on
opening
the
smaller
volumes
odo
felt
the
same
joyous
catching
of
the
breath
as
when
he
had
stepped
out
on
the
at
pianura
for
here
indeed
were
gates
leading
to
a
land
of
delectation
the
country
of
the
giant
morgante
the
enchanted
island
of
avillion
the
court
of
the
soldan
and
the
king
palace
at
camelot
in
this
region
odo
spent
many
blissful
hours
his
fancy
ranged
in
the
wake
of
heroes
and
adventurers
who
for
all
he
knew
might
still
be
feasting
and
fighting
north
of
the
alps
or
might
any
day
with
a
blast
of
their
magic
horns
summon
the
porter
to
the
gates
of
donnaz
foremost
among
them
a
figure
towering
above
even
rinaldo
arthur
and
the
emperor
frederic
was
that
conrad
father
of
conradin
whose
sayings
are
set
down
in
the
old
of
the
cento
novelle
the
flower
of
gentle
speech
there
was
one
tale
of
king
conrad
that
the
boy
never
forgot
how
the
king
in
his
youth
had
always
about
him
a
company
of
twelve
lads
of
his
own
age
how
when
conrad
did
wrong
his
governors
instead
of
punishing
him
beat
his
twelve
companions
and
how
on
the
young
king
asking
what
the
lads
were
being
punished
for
the
pedagogues
replied
for
your
majesty
offences
and
why
do
you
punish
my
companions
instead
of
me
because
you
are
our
lord
and
master
he
was
told
at
this
the
king
fell
to
thinking
and
thereafter
it
is
said
in
pity
for
those
who
must
suffer
in
his
stead
he
set
close
watch
on
himself
lest
his
sinning
should
work
harm
to
others
this
was
the
story
of
king
conrad
and
much
as
odo
loved
the
clash
of
arms
and
joyous
feats
of
paladins
rescuing
fair
maids
in
battle
yet
conrad
seemed
to
him
even
then
a
braver
deed
than
these
in
march
of
the
second
year
the
old
marquess
returning
from
turin
was
accompanied
to
the
surprise
of
all
by
the
fantastical
figure
of
an
elderly
gentleman
in
the
richest
travelling
dress
with
one
of
the
new
french
toupets
a
thin
wrinkled
painted
face
and
emitting
with
every
movement
a
prodigious
odour
of
millefleurs
this
visitor
who
was
attended
by
his
french
barber
and
two
or
three
liveried
servants
the
marquess
introduced
as
the
lord
of
valdu
a
neighbouring
seigneurie
of
no
great
account
though
his
lands
marched
with
the
marquess
it
was
years
since
the
count
had
visited
donnaz
being
one
of
the
chamberlains
and
always
in
attendance
on
his
majesty
and
it
was
amazing
to
see
with
what
smirks
and
grimaces
and
ejaculations
in
piedmontese
french
he
complimented
the
marchioness
on
her
appearance
and
exclaimed
at
the
magnificence
of
the
castle
which
must
doubtless
have
appeared
to
him
little
better
than
a
his
talk
was
unintelligible
to
odo
but
there
was
no
mistaking
the
nature
of
the
glances
he
fixed
on
donna
laura
who
having
fled
to
her
room
on
his
approach
presently
descended
in
a
ravishing
new
sacque
with
an
air
of
extreme
surprise
and
her
hair
curled
as
odo
afterward
learned
by
the
count
own
barber
odo
had
never
seen
his
mother
look
handsomer
she
sparkled
at
the
count
compliments
embraced
her
father
playfully
readjusted
her
mother
coif
and
in
the
prettiest
way
made
their
excuses
to
the
count
for
the
cold
draughts
and
bare
floors
of
the
castle
for
having
lived
at
court
myself
said
she
i
know
to
what
your
excellency
is
accustomed
and
can
the
better
value
your
condescension
in
exposing
yourself
at
this
rigorous
season
to
the
hardships
of
our
the
marquess
at
this
began
to
look
black
but
seeing
the
pleasure
in
the
compliment
contented
himself
with
calling
out
for
dinner
which
said
he
with
all
respect
to
their
visitor
would
stay
his
stomach
better
than
the
french
at
his
majesty
table
whether
the
count
was
of
the
same
mind
it
was
impossible
to
say
though
odo
could
not
help
observing
that
the
stewed
venison
and
spiced
flesh
seemed
to
present
certain
obstacles
either
to
his
jaws
or
his
palate
and
that
his
appetite
lingered
on
the
fried
and
in
oil
but
he
cast
such
looks
at
donna
laura
as
seemed
to
declare
that
for
her
sake
he
would
willingly
have
risked
his
teeth
on
the
very
cobblestones
of
the
court
knowing
how
she
pined
for
company
odo
was
not
surprised
at
his
mother
complaisance
yet
wondered
to
see
the
smile
with
which
she
presently
received
the
count
disparagement
of
pianura
for
the
duchy
by
his
showing
was
a
place
of
small
consequence
an
asylum
of
superannuated
fashions
whereas
no
frenchman
of
quality
ever
visited
turin
without
exclaiming
on
its
resemblance
to
paris
and
vowing
that
none
who
had
the
entree
of
stupinigi
need
cross
the
alps
to
see
versailles
as
to
the
depriving
the
court
of
donna
laura
presence
their
guest
protested
against
it
as
an
act
of
overt
disloyalty
to
the
sovereign
and
what
most
surprised
odo
who
had
often
heard
his
grandfather
declaim
against
the
count
as
a
cheap
jackanapes
that
hung
about
the
court
for
what
he
could
make
at
play
was
the
indulgence
with
which
the
marquess
received
his
visitor
sallies
father
and
daughter
in
fact
vied
in
amenities
to
the
count
the
fire
was
kept
alight
all
day
in
his
rooms
his
monsu
waited
on
with
singular
civility
by
the
steward
and
donna
laura
own
woman
sent
down
by
her
mistress
to
prepare
his
morning
chocolate
next
day
it
was
agreed
the
gentlemen
should
ride
to
valdu
but
its
lord
being
as
as
a
marionette
donna
laura
with
charming
tact
begged
to
be
of
the
party
and
thus
enabled
him
to
attend
her
in
her
litter
the
marquess
thereupon
called
on
odo
to
ride
with
him
and
setting
forth
across
the
mountain
they
descended
by
a
long
defile
to
the
village
of
valdu
here
for
the
first
time
odo
saw
the
spectacle
of
a
neglected
estate
its
last
penny
wrung
from
it
for
the
absent
master
pleasure
by
a
bailiff
who
was
expected
to
extract
his
pay
from
the
sale
of
clandestine
concessions
to
the
tenants
riding
beside
the
marquess
who
swore
under
his
breath
at
the
ravages
of
the
undyked
stream
and
the
sight
of
good
arable
land
run
wild
and
choked
with
underbrush
the
little
boy
obtained
a
precocious
insight
into
the
evils
of
a
system
which
had
long
outlived
its
purpose
and
the
idea
of
feudalism
was
ever
afterward
embodied
for
him
in
his
glimpse
of
the
peasants
of
valdu
looking
up
sullenly
from
their
work
as
their
suzerain
and
protector
thrust
an
unfamiliar
painted
smile
between
the
curtains
of
his
litter
what
his
grandfather
thought
of
valdu
to
which
the
count
on
the
way
home
referred
with
smirking
apologies
as
the
of
his
barbarous
ancestors
was
patent
enough
even
to
odo
undeveloped
perceptions
but
it
would
have
required
a
more
experienced
understanding
to
detect
the
motive
that
led
the
marquess
scarce
two
days
after
their
visit
to
accord
his
daughter
hand
to
the
count
odo
felt
a
shock
of
dismay
on
learning
that
his
beautiful
mother
was
to
become
the
property
of
an
old
gentleman
whom
he
guessed
to
be
of
his
grandfather
age
and
whose
enamoured
grimaces
recalled
the
antics
of
her
favourite
monkey
and
the
boy
face
reflected
the
blush
of
embarrassment
with
which
donna
laura
imparted
the
news
but
the
children
of
that
day
were
trained
to
a
passive
acquiescence
and
had
she
informed
him
that
she
was
to
be
chained
in
the
keep
on
bread
and
water
odo
would
have
accepted
the
fact
with
equal
philosophy
three
weeks
afterward
his
mother
and
the
old
count
were
married
in
the
chapel
of
donnaz
and
donna
laura
with
many
tears
and
embraces
set
out
for
turin
taking
her
monkey
but
leaving
her
son
behind
it
was
not
till
later
that
odo
learned
of
the
social
usage
which
compelled
young
widows
to
choose
between
remarriage
and
the
cloister
and
his
subsequent
views
were
unconsciously
tinged
by
the
remembrance
of
his
mother
melancholy
bridal
her
departure
left
no
traces
but
were
speedily
repaired
by
the
coming
of
spring
the
sun
growing
warmer
and
the
close
season
putting
an
end
to
the
marquess
hunting
it
was
now
odo
chief
pleasure
to
carry
his
books
to
the
walled
garden
between
the
castle
and
the
southern
face
of
the
cliff
this
small
enclosure
probably
a
survival
of
medieval
horticulture
had
along
the
upper
ledge
of
its
wall
a
grass
walk
commanding
the
flow
of
the
stream
and
an
angle
turret
that
turned
one
slit
to
the
valley
the
other
to
the
garden
lying
below
like
a
tranquil
well
of
scent
and
brightness
its
box
trees
clipped
to
the
shape
of
peacocks
and
lions
its
clove
pinks
and
simples
set
in
a
border
of
thrift
and
a
pear
tree
basking
on
its
sunny
wall
these
pleasant
spaces
which
odo
had
to
himself
save
when
the
canonesses
walked
there
to
recite
their
rosary
he
peopled
with
the
knights
and
ladies
of
the
novelle
and
the
fantastic
beings
of
pulci
epic
there
walked
the
fay
morgana
regulus
the
loyal
knight
the
giant
morgante
trajan
the
just
emperor
and
the
proud
figure
of
king
conrad
so
that
escaping
thither
from
the
dullness
of
the
tapestry
parlour
the
boy
seemed
to
pass
from
the
most
oppressive
solitude
to
a
world
of
warmth
and
fellowship
odo
who
like
all
neglected
children
was
quick
to
note
in
the
demeanour
of
his
elders
any
hint
of
a
change
in
his
own
condition
had
been
keenly
conscious
of
the
effect
produced
at
donnaz
by
the
news
of
the
duchess
of
pianura
deliverance
guided
perhaps
by
his
exclamation
he
noticed
an
added
zeal
in
don
gervaso
teachings
and
an
unction
in
the
manner
of
his
aunts
and
grandmother
who
embraced
him
as
though
they
were
handling
a
relic
while
the
old
marquess
though
he
took
his
grandson
seldomer
on
his
rides
would
sit
staring
at
him
with
a
frowning
tenderness
that
once
found
vent
in
the
growl
morbleu
but
he
too
good
for
the
tonsure
all
this
made
it
clear
to
odo
that
he
was
indeed
meant
for
the
church
and
he
learned
without
surprise
that
the
following
spring
he
was
to
be
sent
to
the
seminary
at
asti
with
a
view
to
prepare
him
for
this
change
the
canonesses
suggested
his
attending
them
that
year
on
their
annual
pilgrimage
to
the
sanctuary
of
oropa
thither
for
every
feast
of
the
assumption
these
pious
ladies
travelled
in
their
litter
and
odo
had
heard
from
them
many
tales
of
the
miraculous
black
virgin
who
drew
thousands
to
her
shrine
among
the
mountains
they
set
forth
in
august
two
days
before
the
feast
ascending
through
chestnut
groves
to
the
region
of
bare
rocks
thence
downward
across
torrents
hung
with
white
acacia
and
along
grassy
levels
deep
in
shade
the
lively
air
the
murmur
of
verdure
the
perfume
of
mown
grass
in
the
meadows
and
the
sweet
call
of
the
cuckoos
from
every
thicket
made
an
enchantment
of
the
way
but
odo
pleasure
redoubled
when
gaining
the
to
oropa
they
mingled
with
the
long
train
of
devotees
ascending
from
the
plain
here
were
pilgrims
of
every
condition
from
the
noble
lady
of
turin
or
asti
for
it
was
the
favourite
pilgrimage
of
the
sardinian
court
attended
by
her
physician
and
her
cicisbeo
to
the
goatherd
of

salluzzo

cheerful
farmers
of
the
milanese
with
their
wives
in
silver
necklaces
and
hairpins
riding

on
plump
white
asses
sick
persons
travelling
in
closed
litters
or
carried
on
crippled
beggars
obtruding
their
deformities
confraternities
of
hooded
penitents
franciscans
capuchins
and
poor
clares
in
dusty
companies
jugglers
pedlars

and
sellers
of
drugs
and
amulets

among
these

the

jogged
along
an
odd
figure
advanced
toward
odo
who
had
obtained
leave
to
do
the
last
mile
of
the
journey
on
foot
this
was
a
plump
abate
in
tattered
ecclesiastical
dress
his
shoes
white
as
a
miller
and
the
perspiration
streaking
his
face
as
he
laboured
along
in
the
dust
he
accosted
odo
in
a
soft
shrill
voice
begging
leave
to
walk
beside
the
young
cavaliere
whom
he
had
more
than
once
had
the
honour
of
seeing
at
pianura
and
in
reply
to
the
boy
surprised
glance
added
with
a
swelling
of
the
chest
and
an
absurd
gesture
of
but
perhaps
the
cavaliere
is
not
too
young
to
have
heard
of
the
illustrious
cantapresto
late
primo
soprano
of
the
ducal
theatre
of
pianura
odo
being
obliged
to
avow
his
ignorance
the
fat
creature
mopped
his
brow
and
continued
with
a
gasp
ah
your
excellency
what
is
fame
from
glory
to
obscurity
is
no
farther
than
from
one
milestone
to
another
not
eight
years
ago
cavaliere
i
was
followed
through
the
streets
of
pianura
by
a
greater
crowd
than
the
duke
ever
drew
after
him
but
what
then
the
voice
goes
it
lasts
no
longer
than
the
bloom
of
a
flower
and
with
it
goes
everything
fortune
credit
consideration
friends
and
parasites
not
eight
years
ago
sir
would
you
believe
me
i
was
supping
nightly
in
private
with
the
bishop
who
had
nearly
quarrelled
with
his
late
highness
for
carrying
me
off
by
force
one
evening
to
his
casino
i
was
heaped
with
dignities
and
favours
all
the
poets
in
the
town
composed
sonnets
in
my
honour
the
marquess
of
trescorre
fought
a
duel
about
me
with
the
bishop
nephew
don
serafino
i
attended
his
lordship
to
rome
i
spent
the
villeggiatura
at
his
villa
where
i
sat
at
play
with
the
highest
nobles
in
the
land
yet
when
my
voice
went
cavaliere
it
was
on
my
knees
i
had
to
beg
of
my
heartless
patron
the
paltry
favour
of
the
minor
orders
tears
were
running
down
the
cheeks
and
he
paused
to
wipe
them
with
a
corner
of
tattered
bands
though
odo
had
been
bred
in
an
abhorrence
of
the
theatre
the
strange
creature
aspect
so
pricked
his
compassion
that
he
asked
him
what
he
was
now
engaged
in
at
which
cantapresto
piteously
cried
alas
what
am
i
not
engaged
in
if
the
occasion
offers
for
whatever
a
man
habit
he
will
not
wear
it
long
if
it
cover
an
empty
belly
and
he
that
respects
his
calling
must
find
food
enough
to
continue
in
it
but
as
for
me
sir
i
have
put
a
hand
to
every
trade
from
composing
scenarios
for
the
ducal
company
of
pianura
to
writing
satirical
sonnets
for
noblemen
that
desire
to
pass
for
wits
i
a
pretty
taste
too
in
compiling
almanacks
and
when
nothing
else
served
i
have
played
the
public
scrivener
at
the
street
corner
nay
sir
necessity
has
even
driven
me
to
hold
the
candle
in
one
or
two
transactions
i
would
not
more
actively
have
mixed
in
and
it
was
to
efface
the
remembrance
of
one
of
these
for
my
conscience
is
still
for
my
condition
that
i
set
out
on
this
laborious
pilgrimage
much
of
this
was
unintelligible
to
odo
but
he
was
moved
by
any
mention
of
pianura
and
in
the
abate
first
pause
he
risked
the
question
do
you
know
the
boy
brutus
his
companion
stared
and
pursed
his
soft
lips
brutus
says
he
brutus
is
he
about
the
duke
person
he
lives
in
the
palace
said
odo
doubtfully
the
fat
ecclesiastic
clapped
a
hand
to
his
thigh
can
it
be
your
excellency
has
in
mind
the
foundling
boy
carlo
gamba
does
the
jackanapes
call
himself
brutus
now
he
was
always
full
of
his
classical
allusions
why
sir
i
think
i
know
him
very
well
he
is
even
rumoured
to
be
a
brother
of
don
lelio
trescorre
and
i
believe
the
duke
has
lately
given
him
to
the
marquess
of
cerveno
for
i
saw
him
not
long
since
in
the
marquess
livery
at
pontesordo
pontesordo
cried
odo
it
was
there
i
lived
did
you
indeed
cavaliere
but
i
think
you
will
have
been
at
the
manor
of
that
name
and
it
was
the
on
the
edge
of
the
chase
that
i
had
in
mind
the
marquess
uses
it
i
believe
as
a
kind
of
casino
though
not
without
risk
of
a
distemper
indeed
there
is
much
wonder
at
his
frequenting
it
and
is
said
he
does
so
against
the
duke
wishes
the
name
of
pontesordo
had
set
odo
memories
humming
like
a
hive
of
bees
and
without
heeding
his
companion
allusions
he
asked
and
did
you
see
the
momola
the
other
looked
his
perplexity
she
an
innocent
too
odo
hastened
to
explain
she
is
servant
at
the
farm
the
abate
at
this
standing
still
in
the
road
screwed
up
his
eyelids
and
protruded
a
relishing
lip
eh
eh
said
he
the
girl
from
the
farm
you
say
and
he
gave
a
chuckle
you
an
eye
cavaliere
an
eye
he
cried
his
soft
body
shaking
with
enjoyment
but
before
odo
could
make
a
guess
at
his
meaning
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
a
sharp
call
from
the
litter
the
abate
at
once
disappeared
in
the
crowd
and
a
moment
later
the
litter
had
debouched
on
the
grassy
quadrangle
before
the
outer
gates
of
the
monastery
this
space
was
set
in
amid
which
gleamed
the
chapels
of
the
way
of
the
cross
and
the
devouter
pilgrims
dispersed
beneath
the
trees
were
ascending
from
one
chapel
to
another
preparatory
to
entering
the
church
the
quadrangle
itself
was
crowded
with
people
and
the
sellers
of
votive
offerings
in
their
booths
roofed
with

driving
a
noisy

corner
a

set
up
his
portable
pulpit
and

in

was
exhorting
the
crowd
in
another
an
improvisatore
intoned
canticles
to
the
miraculous
virgin
a
barefoot
friar
sat
selling
indulgences
at
the
monastery

and
pedlars
with
trays
of
rosaries
and
religious
prints
pushed
their
way
among
the
pilgrims

women
of
less
pious
aspect
solicited
the
attention
of
the
travellers
and
jugglers
mountebanks
and
quacks
of
every
description
hung
on
the
outskirts
of
the
square
the
sight
speedily
turned
thought
from
his
late
companion
and
the
litter
coming
to
a
halt
he
was
leaning
forward
to
observe
the
antics
of
a
tumbler
who
had
spread
his
carpet
beneath
the
trees
when
the
abate
face
suddenly
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
throng
and
his
hand
thrust
a
crumpled
paper
between
the
curtains
of
the
litter
odo
was
enough
to
capture
this
missive
without
attracting
the
notice
of
his
and
stealing
a
glance
at
it
he
read
cavaliere
i
starve
when
the
illustrious
ladies
descend
for
christ
sake
beg
a
scudo
of
them
for
the
unhappy
cantapresto
by
this
the
litter
had
disengaged
itself
and
was
moving
toward
the
outer
gates
odo
aware
of
the
disfavour
with
which
the
theatre
was
viewed
at
donnaz
and
unable
to
guess
how
far
the
soprano
present
habit
would
be
held
to
palliate
the
scandal
of
his
former
connection
was
perplexed
how
to
communicate
his
petition
to
the
canonesses
a
moment
later
however
the
question
solved
itself
for
as
the
aunts
descended
at
the
door
of
the
rector
lodging
the
porter
running
to
meet
them
stumbled
on
a
black
mass
under
the
arcade
and
raised
the
cry
that
here
was
a
man
dropped
dead
a
crowd
gathering
some
one
called
out
that
it
was
an
ecclesiastic

fallen
whereat

whispered
the

that
the
sick
man
was
indeed
an
abate
from
pianura
donna
livia
immediately
bid
her
servants
lift
him
into
the
porter
lodge
where
with
the
administering
of
spirits
the
poor
soprano
presently
revived
and
cast
a
drowning
glance
about
the
chamber
eight
years
ago
illustrious
ladies
he
gurgled
i
had
nearly
died
one
night
of
a
surfeit
of
ortolans
and
now
it
is
of
a
surfeit
of
emptiness
that
i
am
perishing
the
ladies
at
this
with
exclamations
of
pity
called
on
the
for
broth
and
cordials
and
bidding
the
porter
enquire
more
particularly
into
the
history
of
the
unhappy
ecclesiastic
hastened
away
with
odo
to
the
rector
parlour
next
morning
betimes
all
were
afoot
for
the
procession
which
the
canonesses
were
to
witness
from
the
monastery
windows
the
apothecary
had
brought
word
that
the
abate
whose
seizure
was
indeed
the
result
of
hunger
was
still
too
weak
to
rise
and
donna
livia
eager
to
open
her
devotions
with
an
act
of
pity
pressed
a
sequin
in
the
man
hand
and
bid
him
spare
no
care
for
the
sufferer
comfort
this
sent
odo
in
a
cheerful
mood
to
the
windows
whence
peering
between
the
folds
of
his
aunts
gala
habits
he
admired
the
great
court
enclosed
in
cloisters
and
strewn
with
fresh
herbs
and
flowers
thence
one
of
the
rector
chaplains
conducted
them
to
the
church
placing
them
in
company
with
the
monastery
other
noble
guests
in
a
tribune
constructed
above
the
choir
it
was
odo
first
sight
of
a
great
religious
ceremony
and
as
he
looked
down
on
the
church
glimmering
with
votive
offerings
and
draperies
and
seen
through
rolling
incense
in
which
the
swam
like
stars
reflected
in
a
river
he
felt
an
almost
sensual
thrill
of
pleasure
at
the
thought
that
his
life
was
to
be
passed
amid
scenes
of
such
mystic
beauty
the
sweet
singing
of
the
choir
raised
his
spirit
to
a
higher
view
of
the
scene
and
the
sight
of
the
huddled
misery
on
the
floor
of
the
church
revived
in
him
the
old
longing
for
the
franciscan
cowl
from
these
raptures
he
was
speedily
diverted
by
the
sight
awaiting
him
at
the
conclusion
of
the
mass
hardly
had
the
spectators
returned
to
the
rector
windows
when
the
doors
of
the
church
swinging
open
a
procession
headed
by
the
rector
himself
descended
the
steps
and
began
to
make
the
circuit
of
the
court
odo
eyes
swam
with
the
splendour
of
this
burst
of
banners
images
and
jewelled
reliquaries
surmounting
the
long
train
of
tonsured
heads
and
bathed
in
a
light
almost
blinding
after
the
mild
penumbra
of
the
church
as
the
monks
advanced
the
pilgrims
pouring
after
them
filled
the
court
with
a
dark
undulating
mass
through
which
the
procession
wound
like
a
ray
of
sunlight
down
the
brown
bosom
of
a
torrent
branches
of
oleander
swung
in
the
air
devout
cries
hailed
the
approach
of
the
black
madonna
canopy
and
hoarse
voices
swelled
to
a
roar
the
measured
litanies
of
the
friars
the
ceremonies
over
odo
with
the
canonesses
set
out
to
visit
the
chapels
studding
the
above
the
monastic
buildings
passing
out
of
juvara
great
portico
they
stood
a
moment
above
the
grassy
common
which
presented
a
scene
in
curious
contrast
to
that
they
had
just
quitted
here
had
been
set
up
musicians
were
fiddling
jugglers
unrolling
their
carpets
dentists
shouting
out
the
merits
of
their
panaceas
and
light
women
drinking
with
the
liveried
servants
of
the
nobility
the
very
cripples
who
had
groaned
the
loudest
in
church
now
rollicked
with
the
mountebanks
and
dancers
and
no
trace
remained
of
the
celebration
just
concluded
but
the
medals
and
relics
strung
about
the
necks
of
those
engaged
in
these
gross
diversions
it
was
strange
to
pass
from
this
scene
to
the
solitude
of
the
grove
where
in
a
twilight
rustling
with
streams
the
chapels
lifted
their
white
porches
peering
through
the
grated
door
of
each
little
edifice
odo
beheld
within
a
group
of
figures
representing
some
scene
of
the
passion
here
a
last
supper
with
a
tigerish
judas
and
a
saint
john
resting
his
yellow
curls
on
his
master
bosom
there
an
entombment
or
a
group
of
stricken
maries
these
figures
though
rudely
modelled
and
daubed
with
bright
colours
yet
by
a
vivacity
of
attitude
and
gesture
which
the
mystery
of
their
setting
enhanced
conveyed
a
thrilling
impression
of
the
sacred
scenes
set
forth
and
odo
was
yet
at
an
age
when
the
distinction
between
and
its
plastic
counterfeits
is
not
clearly
defined
or
when
at
least
the
sculptured
image
is
still
a
mysterious
thing
denizen
of
some
strange
borderland
between
art
and
life
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
gazed
through
the
chapel
gratings
that
those
episodes
of
the
divine
tragedy
had
been
here
preserved
in
some
miraculous
state
of
suspended
animation
and
as
he
climbed
from
one
shrine
to
another
he
had
the
sense
of
treading
the
actual
stones
of
gethsemane
and
calvary
as
was
usual
with
him
the
impressions
of
the
moment
had
effaced
those
preceding
it
and
it
was
almost
with
surprise
that
at
the
door
he
beheld
the
primo
soprano
of
pianura
totter
forth
to
the
litter
and
offer
his
knee
as
a
step
for
the
canonesses
the
charitable
ladies
cried
out
on
him
for
this
imprudence
and
his
pallor
still
giving
evidence
of
distress
he
was
bidden
to
wait
on
them
after
supper
with
his
story
he
presented
himself
promptly
in
the
parlour
and
being
questioned
as
to
his
condition
at
once
rashly
proclaimed
his
former
connection
with
the
ducal
theatre
of
pianura
no
avowal
could
have
been
more
disastrous
to
his
cause
the
canonesses
crossed
themselves
with
horror
and
the
abate
seeing
his
mistake
hastened
to
repair
it
by
exclaiming
what
ladies
would
you
punish
me
for
following
a
vocation
to
which
my
frivolous
parents
condemned
me
when
i
was
too
young
to
resist
their
purpose
and
have
not
my
subsequent
sufferings
my
penances
and
pilgrimages
and
the
state
to
which
they
have
reduced
me
sufficiently
effaced
the
record
of
an
involuntary
error
seeing
the
effect
of
this
appeal
the
abate
made
haste
to
follow
up
his
advantage
ah
illustrious
ladies
he
cried
am
i
not
a
living
example
of
the
fate
of
those
who
leave
all
to
follow
righteousness
for
while
i
remained
on
the
stage
among
the
most
dissolute
surroundings
fortune
showered
me
with
every
benefit
she
heaps
on
her
favourites
i
had
my
seat
at
every
table
in
pianura
the
duke
chair
to
carry
me
to
the
theatre
and
more
money
than
i
could
devise
how
to
spend
while
now
that
i
have
resigned
my
calling
to
embrace
the
religious
life
you
see
me
reduced
to
begging
a
crust
from
the
very
mendicants
i
formerly
nourished
for
said
he
moved
to
tears
by
his
own
recital
my
superfluity
was
always
spent
in
buying
the
prayers
of
the
unfortunate
and
to
judge
how
i
was
esteemed
by
those
acquainted
with
my
private
behaviour
you
need
only
learn
that
on
my
renouncing
the
stage
was
the
bishop
of
pianura
who
himself
accorded
me
the
tonsure
this
discourse
which
odo
admired
for
its
adroitness
visibly
excited
the
commiseration
of
the
ladies
but
at
mention
of
the
bishop
donna
livia
exchanged
a
glance
with
her
sister
who
enquired
with
a
quaint
air
of
astuteness
but
how
comes
it
abate
that
with
so
powerful
a
protector
you
have
been
exposed
to
such
incredible
reverses
cantapresto
rolled
a
meaning
eye
alas
madam
it
was
through
my
protector
that
misfortune
attacked
me
for
his
lordship
having
appointed
me
secretary
to
his
favourite
nephew
don
serafino
that
imprudent
nobleman
required
of
me
services
so
incompatible
with
my
cloth
that
disobedience
became
a
duty
whereupon
not
satisfied
with
dismissing
me
in
disgrace
he
punished
me
by
blackening
my
character
to
his
uncle
to
defend
myself
was
to
traduce
don
serafino
and
rather
than
reveal
his
courses
to
the
bishop
i
sank
to
the
state
in
which
you
see
me
a
state
he
added
with
emotion
that
i
have
travelled
this
long
way
to
commend
to
the
adorable
pity
of
her
whose
son
had
not
where
to
lay
his
head
this
stroke
visibly
touched
the
canonesses
still
soft
from
the
macerations
of
the
morning
and
donna
livia
compassionately
asked
how
he
had
subsisted
since
his
rupture
with
the
bishop
madam
by
the
sale
of
my
talents
in
any
service
not
at
odds
with
my
calling
as
the
compiling
of
pious
almanacks
the
inditing
of
rhymed
litanies
and
canticles
and
even
the
construction
of
theatrical
pieces
the
ladies
lifted
hands
of
reprobation
of
theatrical
pieces
cantapresto
impressively
repeated
for
the
use
of
the
carmelite
nuns
of
pianura
but
said
he
with
a
deprecating
smile
the
wages
of
virtue
are
less
liberal
than
those
of
sin
and
spite
of
a
versatility
i
think
i
may
honestly
claim
i
have
often
had
to
subsist
on
the
gifts
of
the
pious
and
sometimes
madam
to
starve
on
their
compassion
this
ready
discourse
and
the
soprano
evident
distress
so
worked
on
the
canonesses
that
having
little
money
at
their
disposal
it
was
fixed
after
some
private
consultation
that
he
should
attend
them
to
donnaz
where
don
gervaso
in
consideration
of
his
edifying
conduct
in
renouncing
the
stage
might
be
interested
in
helping
him
to
a
situation
and
when
the
little
party
set
forth
from
oropa
the
abate
cantapresto
closed
the
procession
on
one
of
the
with
odo
riding
pillion
at
his
back
good
fortune
loosened
the
poor
soprano
tongue
and
as
soon
as
the
canonesses
litter
was
a
safe
distance
ahead
he
began
to
beguile
the
way
with
fragments
of
reminiscence
and
adventure
though
few
of
his
allusions
were
clear
to
odo
the
glimpse
they
gave
of
the
motley
theatrical
life
of
the
north
italian
cities
the
quarrels
between
goldoni
and
the
supporters
of
the
expiring
commedia
dell
arte
the
rivalries
of
the
prime
donne
and
the
arrogance
of
the
popular
comedians
all
these
peeps
into
a
tinsel
world
of
mirth
cabal
and
folly
enlivened
by
the
recurring
names
of
the
four
masks
those
lingering
gods
of
the
older
dispensation
so
lured
the
boy
fancy
and
set
free
his
vagrant
wonder
that
he
was
almost
sorry
to
see
the
keep
of
donnaz
reddening
in
the
second
evening
sunset
such
regrets
however
their
arrival
at
the
castle
soon
effaced
for
in
the
doorway
stood
the
old
marquess
a
letter
in
hand
who
springing
forward
caught
his
grandson
by
the
shoulders
and
cried
with
his
great
shout
cavaliere
you
are
of
pianura
the
marquess
of
cerveno
had
succumbed
to
the
tertian
ague
contracted
at
the
of
pontesordo
and
this
unforeseen
calamity
left
but
one
life
that
of
the
sickly
ducal
infant
between
odo
and
the
succession
to
the
throne
of
pianura
such
was
the
news
conveyed
from
turin
by
donna
laura
who
added
the
duke
express
wish
that
his
young
kinsman
should
be
fitted
for
the
secular
career
and
the
information
that
count
valdu
had
already
entered
his
stepson
name
at
the
royal
academy
of
turin
the
duke
of
pianura
being
young
and
in
good
health
and
his
wife
having
already
given
him
an
heir
the
most
sanguine
imagination
could
hardly
view
odo
as
being
brought
much
nearer
the
succession
yet
the
change
in
his
condition
was
striking
enough
to
excuse
the
fancy
of
those
about
him
for
shaping
the
future
to
their
liking
the
priestling
was
to
turn
courtier
and
perhaps
soldier
asti
was
to
be
exchanged
for
turin
the
seminary
for
the
academy
and
even
the
old
chief
of
donnaz
betrayed
in
his
grumbling
counsels
to
the
boy
a
sense
of
the
exalted
future
in
which
they
might
some
day
serve
him
the
preparations
of
departure
and
the
wonder
of
his
new
state
left
odo
little
space
wherein
to
store
his
thought
with
impressions
of
what
he
was
leaving
and
it
was
only
in
after
years
when
the
accretion
of
superficial
incident
had
dropped
from
his
past
that
those
last
days
at
donnaz
gained
their
full
distinctness
he
saw
them
then
heavy
with
the
warmth
of
the
long
summer
from
the
topmost
to
the
bronzed
vineyards
turning
their
metallic
clusters
to
the
sun
and
in
the
midst
his
small
bewildered
figure
netted
in
a
web
of
association
and
seeming
as
he
broke
away
to
leave
a
shred
of
himself
in
every
corner
of
the
castle
sharpest
of
all
there
remained
with
him
the
vision
of
his
last
hour
with
don
gervaso
the
news
of
odo
changed
condition
had
been
received
in
silence
by
the
chaplain
he
was
not
the
man
to
waste
words
and
he
knew
the
futility
of
asserting
the
church
claim
to
the
of
a
reigning
house
therefore
if
he
showed
no
enthusiasm
he
betrayed
no
resentment
but
the
evening
before
the
departure
led
him
still
in
silence
to
the
chapel
here
the
priest
knelt
with
odo
then
raising
him
sat
on
one
of
the
benches
facing
the
high
altar
and
spoke
a
few
grave
words
you
are
setting
out
said
he
on
a
way
far
different
from
that
in
which
it
has
been
my
care
to
guide
you
yet
the
high
road
and
the
mountain
path
may
by
diverse
windings
lead
to
the
same
point
and
whatever
walk
a
man
chooses
it
will
surely
carry
him
to
the
end
that
god
has
appointed
if
you
are
called
to
serve
him
in
the
world
the
journey
on
which
you
are
now
starting
may
lead
you
to
the
throne
of
pianura
but
even
so
he
went
on
there
is
this
i
would
have
you
remember
that
should
this
dignity
come
to
you
it
may
come
as
a
calamity
rather
than
a
joy
for
when
god
confers
earthly
honours
on
a
child
of
his
predilection
he
sometimes
deigns
to
render
them
as
innocuous
as
misfortune
and
my
chief
prayer
for
you
is
that
you
should
be
raised
to
this
eminence
it
may
be
at
a
moment
when
such
advancement
seems
to
thrust
you
in
the
dust
the
words
burned
themselves
into
odo
heart
like
some
mystic
writing
on
the
walls
of
memory
long
afterward
to
start
into
fiery
meaning
at
the
time
he
felt
only
that
the
priest
spoke
with
a
power
and
dignity
no
human
authority
could
give
and
for
a
moment
all
the
stored
influences
of
his
faith
reached
out
to
him
from
the
altar
the
next
sun
rose
on
a
new
world
he
was
to
set
out
at
daylight
and
dawn
found
him
at
the
casement
footing
it
in
thought
down
the
road
as
yet
undistinguishable
in
a
dying
glimmer
of
stars
bruno
was
to
attend
him
to
turin
but
one
of
the
women
presently
brought
word
that
the
old
huntsman
rheumatism
had
caught
him
in
the
knee
and
that
the
marquess
resolved
not
to
delay
his
grandson
departure
had
chosen
cantapresto
as
the
boy
companion
the
courtyard
when
odo
descended
fairly
bubbled
with
the
voluble
joy
of
the
fat
soprano
who
was
giving
directions
to
the
servants
receiving
commissions
and
instructions
from
the
aunts
assuring
everybody
of
his
undying
devotion
to
the
of
pianura
and
citing
impressive
instances
of
the
responsibilities
with
which
the
great
of
the
earth
had
formerly
entrusted
him
as
a
companion
for
odo
the
abate
was
clearly
not
to
don
gervaso
taste
but
he
stood
silent
turning
the
comment
of
a
cool
eye
on
the
protestations
and
saying
only
as
cantapresto
swept
the
company
into
the
circle
of
an
obsequious
farewell
remember
signor
abate
it
is
to
your
cloth
this
business
is
entrusted
the
abate
answer
was
a
rush
of
purple
to
the
forehead
but
don
gervaso
imperturbably
added
and
you
lie
but
one
night
on
the
road
meanwhile
the
old
marquess
visibly
moved
was
charging
odo
to
respect
his
elders
and
superiors
while
in
the
same
breath
warning
him
not
to
take
up
with
the
frenchified
notions
of
the
court
but
to
remember
that
for
a
lad
of
his
condition
the
chief
virtues
were
a
tight
seat
in
the
saddle
a
quick
hand
on
the
sword
and
a
slow
tongue
in
counsel
mind
your
own
business
he
concluded
and
see
that
others
mind
theirs
the
marchioness
thereupon
with
many
tears
hung
a
scapular
about
neck
bidding
him
shun
the
theatre
and
be
regular
at
confession
one
of
the
canonesses
reminded
him
not
to
omit
a
visit
to
the
chapel
of
the
holy
while
the
other
begged
him
to
burn
a
candle
for
her
at
the
consolata
and
the
servants
pressed
forward
to
embrace
and
bless
their
little
master
day
was
high
by
this
and
as
the
marquess
rumbled
down
the
valley
the
shadows
seemed
to
fly
before
it
odo
at
first
lay
numb
but
presently
his
senses
woke
to
the
call
of
the
brightening
landscape
the
scene
was
such
as
salvator
might
have
painted
wild
blocks
of
stone
heaped
under
here
the
white
plunge
of
water
down
a
wall
of
granite
and
there
in
bluer
depths
a
charcoal
burner
hut
sending
up
its
spiral
of
smoke
to
the
dark
raftering
of
branches
though
it
was
but
a
few
hours
since
odo
had
travelled
from
oropa
years
seemed
to
have
passed
over
him
and
he
saw
the
world
with
a
new
eye
each
sound
and
scent
plucked
at
him
in
passing
the
roadside
started
into
detail
like
the
foreground
of
some
minute
dutch
painter
every
pendent
mass
of
fern
dark
dripping
rock
late
tuft
of
harebell
called
out
to
him
look
well
for
this
is
your
last
sight
of
us
his
first
sight
too
it
seemed
since
he
had
lived
through
twelve
italian
summers
without
sense
of
the
quality
of
atmosphere
that
even
in
shade
gives
each
object
a
golden
salience
he
was
conscious
of
it
now
only
as
it
suggested
fingering
a
missal
stiff
with
and
edged
with
a
swarming
diversity
of
buds
and
insects
the
carriage
moved
so
slowly
that
he
was
in
no
haste
to
turn
the
pages
and
each
spike
of
yellow
foxglove
each
clouding
of
butterflies
about
a
patch
of
speedwell
each
quiver
of
grass
over
a
hidden
thread
of
moisture
became
a
marvel
to
be
thumbed
and
treasured
from
this
mood
he
was
detached
by
the
next
bend
of
the
road
the
way
hitherto
winding
through
narrow
glens
now
swung
to
a
ledge
overhanging
the
last
escarpment
of
the
mountains
and
far
below
the
piedmontese
plain
unrolled
to
the
southward
its
interminable
distances
mottled
with
forest
a
sight
to
lift
the
heart
for
on
those
sunny
reaches
ivrea
novara
vercelli
lay
like
on
a
summer
sea
it
was
the
future
unfolding
itself
to
the
boy
dark
forests
wide
rivers
strange
cities
and
a
new
horizon
all
the
mystery
of
the
coming
years
figured
to
him
in
that
great
plain
stretching
away
to
the
greater
mystery
of
heaven
to
all
this
cantapresto
turned
a
snoring
countenance
the
lively
air
of
the
hills
the
good
fare
of
donnaz
and
the
satisfaction
above
all
of
rolling
on
cushions
over
a
road
he
had
thought
to
trudge
on
foot
had
lapped
the
abate
in
capuan
slumber
the
midday
halt
aroused
him
the
travellers
rested
at
an
inn
on
the
edge
of
the
hills
and
here
cantapresto
proved
to
his
charge
that
as
he
phrased
it
his
belly
had
as
short
a
memory
for
food
as
his
heart
for
injuries
a
flask
of
asti
put
him
in
the
talking
mood
and
as
they
drove
on
he
regaled
odo
with
a
lively
picture
of
the
life
on
which
he
was
about
to
enter
you
are
going
said
he
to
one
of
the
first
cities
of
europe
one
that
has
all
the
beauty
and
elegance
of
the
french
capital
without
its
follies
and
excesses
turin
is
blessed
with
a
court
where
good
manners
and
a
fine
tone
are
more
highly
prized
than
the
extravagances
of
genius
and
i
have
heard
it
said
of
his
majesty
that
he
was
delighted
to
see
his
courtiers
wearing
the
french
fashions
outside
their
heads
provided
they
did
carry
the
french
ideas
within
you
are
too
young
doubtless
cavaliere
to
have
heard
of
the
philosophers
who
are
raising
such
a
pother
north
of
the
alps
a
set
of
madmen
that
because
their
birth
does
give
them
the
entree
of
versailles
are
preaching
that
men
should
return
to
a
state
of
nature
great
ladies
suckle
their
young
like
animals
and
the
peasantry
own
their
land
like
nobles
luckily
hear
little
of
this
infectious
talk
in
turin
the
king
stamps
out
the
philosophers
like
vermin
or
packs
them
off
to
splutter
their
heresies
in
milan
or
venice
but
to
a
nobleman
mindful
of
the
privileges
of
his
condition
there
is
no
more
agreeable
sojourn
in
europe
the
wines
are
delicious
the
women
er
accomplished
and
though
the
sbirri
may
hug
one
a
trifle
close
now
and
then
why
with
money
and
discretion
a
friend
or
two
in
the
right
quarters
and
the
wit
to
stand
well
with
the
church
there
no
city
in
europe
where
a
man
may
have
pleasanter
sins
to
confess
the
carriage
by
this
was
descending
the
last
curves
above
the
valley
and
before
them
in
a
hollow
of
the
hills
blinked
the
warm
shimmer
of
maize
and
vine
like
some
bright
vintage
brimming
its
cup
the
soprano
waved
a
convivial
hand
look
he
cried
what
nature
has
done
for
this
happy
region
where
herself
has
spread
the
table
so
bountifully
should
her
children
hang
back
from
the
feast
i
vow
cavaliere
if
the
mountains
were
built
for
hermits
and
ascetics
then
the
plain
was
made
level
for
dancing
banqueting
and
the
pleasures
of
the
villeggiatura
if
god
had
meant
us
to
break
our
teeth
on
nuts
and
roots
why
did
he
hang
the
vine
with
fruit
and
draw
three
crops
of
wheat
from
this
indulgent
soil
i
protest
when
i
look
on
such
a
scene
as
this
it
is
sufficient
incentive
to
lowliness
to
remember
that
the
meek
shall
inherit
the
earth
this
mood
held
cantapresto
till
his
sleep
overtook
him
and
when
he
woke
again
the
chariot
was
clattering
across
the
bridge
of
chivasso
the
po
rolled
its
sunset
crimson
between
flats
that
seemed
dull
and
featureless
after
the
broken
scenery
of
the
hills
but
beyond
the
bridge
rose
the
towers
and
roofs
of
the
town
with
its
catching
the
last
slant
of
light
in
the
streets
dusk
had
fallen
and
a
lamp
flared
under
the
arch
of
the
inn
before
which
the
travellers
halted
odo
head
was
heavy
and
he
hardly
noticed
the
figures
thronging
the
caffe
into
which
they
were
led
but
presently
there
rose
a
shout
of
cantapresto
and
a
ring
of
waving
arms
and
flashing
teeth
encircled
his
companion
these
appendages
belonged
to
a
troop
of
men
and
women
some
masked
and
in
motley
others
in
discoloured
garments
who
pressed
about
the
soprano
with
cries
of
joyous
recognition
he
was
evidently
an
old
favourite
of
the
band
for
a
duenna
in
tattered
velvet
fell
on
his
neck
with
genial
unreserve
a
pert
soubrette
caught
him
by
the
arm
the
duenna
left
free
and
a
terrific
matamor
with
a
nose
like
a
scimitar
slapped
him
on
the
back
with
a
tin
sword
odo
glimpse
of
the
square
at
oropa
told
him
that
here
was
a
band
of
strolling
players
such
as
cantapresto
had
talked
of
on
the
ride
back
to
donnaz
don
gervaso
instructions
and
the
old
marchioness
warning
against
the
theatre
were
present
enough
in
the
boy
mind
to
add
a
touch
of
awe
to
the
curiosity
with
which
he
observed
these
strange
objects
of
the
church
reprobation
they
struck
him
it
must
be
owned
as
more
pitiable
than
alarming
for
the
duenna
toes
were
coming
through
her
shoes
and
one
or
two
of
the
children
who
hung
on
the
outskirts
of
the
group
looked
as
lean
and
hungry
under
their
spangles
as
the
of
pontesordo
spite
of
this
they
seemed
a
jolly
crew
and
ready
at
cantapresto
expense
to
celebrate
their
encounter
with
the
in
unlimited
libations
of
asti
and
val
pulicello
the
singer
however
hung
back
with
protesting
gestures
gently
then
gently
dear
friends
dear
companions
when
was
it
we
parted
in
the
spring
of
the
year
and
we
meet
now
in
the
late
summer
as
the
seasons
change
so
do
our
conditions
if
the
spring
is
a
season
of
folly
then
is
the
the
period
for
reflection
when
we
last
met
i
was
a
strolling
poet
glad
to
serve
your
gifted
company
within
the
scope
of
my
talents
now
ladies
and
gentlemen
now
he
drew
himself
up
with
pride
now
you
behold
in
me
the
governor
and
friend
of
the
of
pianura
cries
of
incredulity
and
derision
greeted
this
announcement
and
one
of
the
girls
called
out
laughingly
yet
you
have
the
same
old
cassock
to
your
back
and
the
same
old
passage
from
your
mouth
to
your
belly
added
an
elastic
harlequin
reaching
an
arm
across
the
women
shoulders
come
cantapresto
we
help
you
line
it
with
good
wine
to
the
health
of
his
most
superlatively
serene
highness
the
of
pianura
and
where
is
that
fabulous
personage
by
the
way
odo
at
this
retreated
hastily
behind
the
soprano
but
a
pretty
girl
catching
sight
of
him
he
found
himself
dragged
into
the
centre
of
the
company
who
hailed
him
with
fantastic
obeisances
supper
meanwhile
was
being
laid
on
the
greasy
table
down
the
middle
of
the
room
the
matamor
who
seemed
the
director
of
the
troupe
thundered
out
his
orders
for
maccaroni
fried
eels
and
sausages
the
flanked
the
plates
with
and
lumps
of
black
bread
and
in
a
moment
the
hungry
comedians
thrusting
odo
into
a
high
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
were
falling
on
the
repast
with
a
prodigious
clatter
of
cutlery
of
the
subsequent
incidents
of
the
feast
the
banter
of
the
younger
women
the
duenna
lachrymose
confidences
the
incessant
interchange
of
theatrical
jargon
and
coarse
pleasantry
there
remained
to
odo
but
a
confused
image
obscured
by
the
smoke
of
guttering
candles
the
fumes
of
wine
and
the
stifling
air
of
the
tavern
even
the
face
of
the
pretty
girl
who
had
dragged
him
from
his
concealment
and
who
now
sat
at
his
side
plying
him
with
sweets
from
her
own
plate
began
to
fade
into
the
general
blur
and
his
last
impression
was
of
figure
dilating
to
immense
proportions
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
as
the
soprano
rose
with
shaking
to
favour
the
company
with
a
song
the
chorus
bursting
forth
in
response
surged
over
odo
drowning
senses
and
he
was
barely
aware
in
the
tumult
of
noise
and
lights
of
an
arm
slipped
about
him
a
pillow
beneath
his
head
and
the
gradual
subsidence
into
dark
delicious
peace
so
on
the
first
night
of
his
new
life
the
of
pianura
fell
asleep
with
his
head
in
a
breast
the
travellers
were
to
journey
by
vettura
from
chivasso
to
turin
and
when
odo
woke
next
morning
the
carriage
stood
ready
in
the
courtyard
cantapresto
mottled
and
shamefaced
with
his
bands
awry
and
an
air
of
tottering
dignity
was
gathering
their
possessions
together
and
the
pretty
girl
who
had
pillowed
odo
slumbers
now
knelt
by
his
bed
and
laughingly
drew
on
his
stockings
she
was
a
slim
brown
morsel
not
much
above
his
age
with
a
glance
that
flitted
like
a
bird
and
round
shoulders
slipping
out
of
her
kerchief
a
wave
of
shyness
bathed
odo
to
the
forehead
as
their
eyes
met
he
hung
his
head
stupidly
and
turned
away
when
she
fetched
the
comb
to
dress
his
hair
his
toilet
completed
she
called
out
to
the
abate
to
go
below
and
see
that
the
cavaliere
chocolate
was
ready
and
as
the
door
closed
she
turned
and
kissed
odo
on
the
lips
oh
how
red
you
are
she
cried
laughing
is
that
the
first
kiss
you
ever
had
then
you
remember
me
when
you
duke
of
pianura
mirandolina
of
chioggia
the
first
girl
you
ever
kissed
she
was
pulling
his
collar
straight
while
she
talked
so
that
he
could
not
get
away
from
her
you
will
remember
me
wo
you
she
persisted
i
shall
be
a
great
actress
by
that
time
and
you
appoint
me
prima
amorosa
to
the
ducal
theatre
of
pianura
and
throw
me
a
diamond
bracelet
from
your
highness
box
and
make
all
the
court
ladies
ready
to
poison
me
for
rage
she
released
his
collar
and
dropped
away
from
him
ah
no
i
shall
be
a
poor
strolling
player
and
you
a
great
prince
she
sighed
and
you
never
never
think
of
me
again
but
i
shall
always
remember
that
i
was
the
first
girl
you
ever
kissed
she
hung
back
in
a
dazzle
of
tears
looking
so
bright
and
tender
that
odo
bashfulness
melted
like
a
spring
frost
i
shall
never
be
duke
he
cried
and
i
shall
never
forget
you
and
with
that
he
turned
and
kissed
her
boldly
and
then
bolted
down
the
stairs
like
a
hare
and
all
that
day
he
scorched
and
froze
with
the
thought
that
perhaps
she
had
been
laughing
at
him
cantapresto
was
torpid
after
the
feast
and
odo
detected
in
him
an
air
of
guilty
constraint
the
boy
was
glad
enough
to
keep
silence
and
they
rolled
on
without
speaking
through
the
wide
glowing
landscape
already
the
nearness
of
a
great
city
began
to
make
itself
felt
the
bright
champaign
was
scattered
over
with
their
and
their
granges
latticed
with
openwork
pleasantly
breaking
the
expanse
of
maize
and
mulberry
villages
lay
along
the
banks
of
the
canals
intersecting
the
plain
and
the
hills
beyond
the
po
were
planted
with
villas
and
monasteries
all
the
afternoon
they
drove
between
umbrageous
parks
and
under
the
walls
of
terraced
vineyards
it
was
a
region
of
delectable
shade
with
glimpses
here
and
there
of
gardens
flashing
with
fountains
and
villa
roofs
decked
with
statues
and
vases
and
at
length
toward
sunset
a
bend
of
the
road
brought
them
out
on
a
city
so
flourishing
in
buildings
so
beset
with
smiling
hills
that
odo
springing
from
his
seat
cried
out
in
sheer
joy
of
the
spectacle
they
had
still
the
suburbs
to
traverse
and
darkness
was
falling
when
they
entered
the
gates
of
turin
this
brought
the
fresh
amazement
of
wide
lamplit
streets
clean
and
bright
as
a
lined
with
palaces
and
filled
with
loungers
officers
in
the
brilliant
sardinian
uniforms
fine
gentlemen
in
french
and
coats
merchants
hurrying
home
from
business
ecclesiastics
in
carriages
and
young
bloods
dashing
by
in
their
curricles
the
tables
before
the
were
thronged
with
idlers
taking
their
chocolate
and
reading
the
gazettes
and
here
and
there
the
arched
doorway
of
a
palace
showed
some
gay
party
supping
al
fresco
in
a
garden
hung
with
lamps
the
flashing
of
lights
and
the
noise
of
the
streets
roused
cantapresto
who
sat
up
with
a
sudden
assumption
of
dignity
ah
cavaliere
said
he
you
now
see
a
great
city
a
famous
city
a
city
aptly
called
paris
of
italy
nowhere
else
shall
you
find
such
streets
such
fair
pavements
shops
so
full
of
parisian
wares
promenades
so
crowded
with
fine
carriages
and
horses
what
a
life
a
young
gentleman
may
lead
here
the
court
is
hospitable
society
amiable
the
theatres
are
the
in
italy
here
cantapresto
paused
with
a
deprecating
cough
only
one
thing
is
necessary
he
went
on
to
complete
enjoyment
of
the
fruits
of
this
garden
of
eden
and
that
is
he
coughed
again
discretion
his
majesty
cavaliere
is
a
father
to
his
subjects
the
church
is
their
zealous
mother
and
between
two
such
parents
and
the
innumerable
delegates
of
their
authority
why
you
may
fancy
sir
that
a
man
has
to
wear
his
eyes
on
all
sides
of
his
head
discretion
is
a
virtue
the
church
herself
commends
it
is
natural
then
that
she
should
afford
her
children
full
opportunity
to
practise
it
and
look
you
cavaliere
it
is
like
gymnastics
the
younger
you
acquire
it
the
less
effort
it
costs
our
maker
himself
has
taught
us
the
value
of
silence
by
putting
us
speechless
into
the
world
if
we
learn
to
talk
later
we
do
it
at
our
own
risk
but
for
your
own
part
cavaliere
since
the
habit
can
not
too
early
be
exercised
i
would
humbly
counsel
you
to
say
nothing
to
your
illustrious
parents
of
our
little
diversion
of
last
evening
the
countess
valdu
lived
on
the
upper
floor
of
a
rococo
palace
near
the
piazza
san
carlo
and
here
odo
led
by
cantapresto
presently
found
himself
shown
into
an
apartment
where
several
ladies
and
gentlemen
sat
at
cards
his
mother
detaching
herself
from
the
group
embraced
him
with
unusual
warmth
and
the
old
count
more
painted
and
perfumed
than
ever
hurried
up
with
an
obsequious
greeting
odo
for
the
first
time
found
himself
of
consequence
in
the
world
and
as
he
was
passed
from
guest
to
guest
questioned
about
his
journey
praised
for
his
good
colour
and
stout
looks
complimented
on
his
high
prospects
and
laughingly
entreated
not
to
forget
his
old
friends
when
fortune
should
advance
him
to
the
duchy
he
began
to
feel
himself
a
reigning
potentate
already
his
mother
as
he
soon
learned
had
sunk
into
a
life
almost
as
dull
and
restricted
as
that
she
had
left
donnaz
to
escape
count
valdu
position
at
court
was
more
ornamental
than
remunerative
the
income
from
his
estates
was
growing
annually
smaller
and
he
was
involved
in
costly
litigation
over
the
sale
of
some
entailed
property
such
conditions
were
little
to
the
countess
humour
and
the
society
to
which
her
narrow
means
confined
her
offered
few
distractions
to
her
vanity
the
frequenters
of
the
house
were
chiefly
poor
relations
and
of
the
count
the
parasites
who
in
those
days
were
glad
to
subsist
on
the
crumbs
of
the
slenderest
larder
hungry
countesses
their
lean
admirers
a
superannuated
abate
or
two
and
a
flock
of
threadbare
ecclesiastics
made
up
donna
laura
circle
and
even
her
cicisbeo
selected
in
family
council
under
the
direction
of
her
confessor
was
an
austere
gentleman
of
middle
age
who
collected
ancient
coins
and
was
engaged
in
composing
an
essay
on
the
martellian
verse
this
company
which
devoted
hours
to
the
new
french
diversion
of
the
parfilage
and
spent
the
evenings
in
drinking
lemonade
and
playing
basset
for
small
stakes
found
its
chief
topic
of
conversation
in
the
only
two
subjects
safely
discussed
in
turin
at
that
day
the
doings
of
the
aristocracy
and
of
the
clergy
the
fashion
of
the
queen
headdress
at
the
last
circle
the
marked
manner
in
which
his
majesty
had
lately
distinguished
the
brilliant
young
cavalry
officer
count
roberto
di
tournanches
the
third
marriage
of
the
countess
alfieri
of
asti
the
incredibility
of
the
rumour
that
the
court
ladies
of
versailles
had
taken
to
white
muslin
and
leghorn
hats
the
probable
significance
of
the
visit
to
rome
the
subject
of
the
next
sacred
representation
to
be
given
by
the
nuns
of
santa
croce
such
were
the
questions
that
engaged
the
noble
frequenters
of
casa
valdu
this
was
the
only
society
that
donna
laura
saw
for
she
was
too
poor
to
dress
to
her
taste
and
too
proud
to
show
herself
in
public
without
the
appointments
becoming
her
station
her
sole
distraction
consisted
in
visits
to
the
various
shrines
the
sudario
the
consolata
the
corpus
domini
at
which
the
feminine
aristocracy
offered
up
its
devotions
and
implored
absolution
for
sins
it
had
often
no
opportunity
to
commit
for
though
fashion
accorded
cicisbei
to
the
fine
ladies
of
turin
the
church
usually
restricted
their
intercourse
to
the
exchange
of
the
most
harmless
amenities
meanwhile
the
antechamber
was
as
full
of
duns
as
the
approach
to
donna
laura
apartment
at
pianura
and
odo
guessed
that
the
warmth
of
the
maternal
welcome
sprang
less
from
natural
affection
than
from
the
hope
of
using
his
expectations
as
a
sop
to
her
creditors
the
pittance
which
the
ducal
treasury
allowed
for
his
education
was
scarce
large
enough
to
be
worth
diverting
to
other
ends
but
a
potential
prince
is
a
shield
to
the
most
vulnerable
fortunes
in
this
character
odo
for
the
first
time
found
himself
flattered
indulged
and
made
the
centre
of
the
company
the
contrast
to
his
life
of
subjection
at
donnaz
the
precocious
initiation
into
motives
that
tainted
the
very
fount
of
filial
piety
the
taste
of
this
mingled
draught
of
adulation
and
disillusionment
might
have
perverted
a
nature
more
than
his
from
this
perversion
and
from
many
subsequent
perils
he
was
saved
by
a
kind
of
imaginative
sympathy
a
wondering
joy
in
the
mere
spectacle
of
life
that
tinged
his
most
personal
impressions
with
a
streak
of
the
philosophic
temper
if
this
trait
did
not
save
him
from
sorrow
it
at
least
lifted
him
above
pettiness
if
it
could
not
solve
the
difficulties
of
life
it
could
arm
him
to
endure
them
it
was
the
best
gift
of
the
past
from
which
he
sprang
but
it
was
blent
with
another
quality
a
deep
moral
curiosity
that
ennobled
his
sensuous
enjoyment
of
the
outward
show
of
life
and
these
elements
were
already
tending
in
him
as
in
countless
youths
of
his
generation
to
the
formation
of
a
new
spirit
the
spirit
that
was
to
destroy
one
world
without
surviving
to
create
another
of
all
this
none
could
have
been
less
conscious
than
the
lad
just
preparing
to
enter
on
his
studies
at
the
royal
academy
of
turin
that
institution
adjoining
the
royal
palace
was
a
kind
of
nursery
or
for
the
budding
nobility
of
savoy
in
one
division
of
the
sumptuous
building
were
housed
his
majesty
pages
a
corps
of
luxurious
indolent
young
fops
another
wing
accommodated
the
regular
students
of
the
academy
sons
of
noblemen
and
gentlemen
destined
for
the
secular
life
while
a
third
was
set
aside
for
the
forestieri
or
students
from
foreign
countries
and
from
the
other
italian
states
to
this
quarter
odo
valsecca
was
allotted
though
it
was
understood
that
on
leaving
the
academy
he
was
to
enter
the
sardinian
service
it
was
customary
for
a
young
gentleman
of
odo
rank
to
be
attended
at
the
academy
not
only
by
a
but
by
a
private
governor
or
pedant
whose
business
it
was
to
overlook
his
studies
attend
him
abroad
and
have
an
eye
to
the
society
he
frequented
the
old
marquess
of
donnaz
had
sent
his
daughter
by
odo
hand
a
letter
recommending
her
to
select
her
son
governor
with
particular
care
choosing
rather
a
person
of
grave
behaviour
and
assured
morality
than
one
of

know

of

the
folios

with
a

handed
the

her
husband
count
valdu
adjusting
his
glasses
observed
it
was
notorious
that
people
living
in
the
depths
of
the
country
thought
themselves
qualified
to
instruct
their
city
relatives
on
all
points
connected
with
the
social
usages
and
the
cicisbeo
suggested
that
he
could
recommend
an
abate
who
was
proficient
in
the
construction
of
the
martellian
verse
and
who
would
made
no
extra
charge
for
that
accomplishment
charges
the
countess
cried
there
a
matter
my
father
does
deign
to
consider
it
not
enough
nowadays
to
give
the
lads
a
governor
but
they
must
maintain
their
servants
too
an
idle
gluttonous
crew
that
prey
on
their
pockets
and
get
a
commission
off
every
tradesman
bill
count
valdu
lifted
a
deprecating
hand
my
dear
nothing
could
be
more
offensive
to
his
majesty
than
any
attempt
to
reduce
the
way
of
living
of
the
pupils
of
the
academy
of
course
she
shrugged
but
who
to
pay
the
duke
beggarly
pittance
hardly
clothes
him
the
cicisbeo
suggested
that
the
cavaliere
odo
had
expectations
at
which
donna
laura
flushed
and
turned
uneasy
while
the
count
part
of
whose
marital
duty
it
was
to
intervene
discreetly
between
his
lady
and
her
knight
now
put
forth
the
remark
that
the
abate
cantapresto
seemed
a
shrewd
serviceable
fellow
nor
do
i
like
to
turn
him
adrift
cried
the
countess
instantly
after
he
has
obliged
us
by
attending
my
son
on
his
journey
and
i
understand
added
the
count
that
he
would
be
glad
to
serve
the
cavaliere
in
any
capacity
you
might
designate
why
not
in
all
said
the
cicisbeo
thoughtfully
there
would
be
undoubted
advantages
to
the
cavaliere
in
possessing
a
servant
who
would
explain
the
globes
while
powdering
his
hair
and
not
be
above
calling
his
chair
when
he
attended
him
to
a
lecture
and
the
upshot
of
it
was
that
when
odo
a
few
days
later
entered
on
his
first
term
at
the
academy
he
was
accompanied
by
the
abate
cantapresto
who
had
agreed
for
a
minimum
of
pay
to
serve
him
faithfully
in
the
double
capacity
of
pedagogue
and
lacquey
the
considerable
liberty
accorded
the
foreign
students
made
odo
first
year
at
the
academy
at
once
pleasanter
and
less
profitable
than
had
he
been
one
of
the
regular
pupils
the
companions
among
whom
he
found
himself
were
a
set
of
lively
undisciplined
young
gentlemen
chiefly
from
england
russia
and
the
german
principalities
all
in
possession
of
more
or
less
and
attended
by
governors
either
pedantic
and
or
vulgarly
subservient
these
young
sprigs
whose
ambition
it
was
to
ape
the
dress
and
manners
of
the
royal
pages
led
a
life
of
dissipation
barely
interrupted
by
a
few
hours
of
attendance
at
the
academic
classes
from
the
of
such
surroundings
odo
was
preserved
by
an
intellectual
curiosity
that
flung
him
ravening
on
his
studies
it
was
not
that
he
was
of
a
bookish
habit
or
that
the
drudgery
of
the
classes
was
less
irksome
to
him
than
to
the
other
pupils
but
not
even
the
pedantic
methods
then
prevailing
or
the
distractions
of
his
new
life
could
dull
the
flush
of
his
first
encounter
with
the
past
his
imagination
took
fire
over
the
dry
pages
of
cornelius
nepos
glowed
with
the
mild
pastoral
warmth
of
the
georgics
and
burst
into
flame
at
the
first
hexameters
of
the
aeneid
he
caught
but
a
fragment
of
meaning
here
and
there
but
the
sumptuous
imagery
the
stirring
names
the
glimpses
into
a
past
where
roman
senators
were
mingled
with
the
gods
of
a
olympus
filled
his
mind
with
a
misty
pageant
of
immortals
these
moments
of
high
emotion
were
interspersed
with
hours
of
plodding
over
the
latin
grammar
and
the
textbooks
of
philosophy
and
logic
books
were
unknown
ground
to
cantapresto
and
among
masters
and
pupils
there
was
not
one
who
could
help
odo
to
the
meaning
of
his
task
or
who
seemed
aware
that
it
might
have
a
meaning
to
most
of
the
lads
about
him
the
purpose
of
the
academy
was
to
fit
young
gentlemen
for
the
army
or
the
court
to
give
them
the
chance
of
sweating
a
shirt
every
morning
with
the
and
of
learning
to
thread
the
intricacies
of
the
court
minuet
they
modelled
themselves
on
the
dress
and
bearing
of
the
pages
who
were
always
ruffling
it
about
the
quadrangle
in
court
dress
and
sword
or
booted
and
spurred
for
a
hunting
at
the
king
chase
of
stupinigi
to
receive
a
nod
or
a
word
from
one
of
these
young
demigods
on
his
way
to
the
king
or
just
back
from
a
at
her
majesty
villa
above
the
po
to
hear
of
their
tremendous
exploits
and
thrilling
escapades
seemed
to
put
the
whole
school
in
touch
with
the
fine
gentleman
world
of
intrigue
cards
and
duelling
the
world
in
which
ladies
were
subjugated
fortunes
lost
adversaries
run
through
and
tradesmen
ruined
with
that
imperturbable
grace
which
distinguished
the
man
of
quality
from
the
plebeian
among
the
privileges
of
the
foreign
pupils
were
frequent
visits
to
the
royal
theatre
and
here
was
to
odo
a
source
of
unimagined
joys
his
superstitious
dread
of
the
stage
a
sentiment
he
soon
discovered
that
not
even
his
mother
director
shared
made
his
heart
beat
oppressively
as
he
first
set
foot
in
the
theatre
it
was
a
gala
night
boxes
and
stalls
were
thronged
and
the
unfolded
its
glittering
curves
like
some
poisonous
flower
enveloping
him
in
rich
malignant
fragrance
this
impression
was
dispelled
by
the
rising
of
the
curtain
on
a
scene
of
such
loveliness
as
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
associate
with
the
tales
of
donnaz
or
with
the
coarse
antics
of
the
comedians
at
chivasso
a
temple
girt
with
mysterious
shade
lifting
its
colonnade
above
a
sunlit
harbour
and
before
the
temple
nymphs
waving
their
thyrsi
through
the
turns
of
a
melodious
dance
such
was
the
vision
that
caught
up
odo
and
swept
him
leagues
away
from
the
rouged
and
starred
assemblage
gathered
in
the
boxes
to
gossip
flirt
eat
ices
and
chocolates
and
incidentally
in
the
pauses
of
their
talk
to
listen
for
a
moment
to
the
ravishing
airs
of
metastasio
achilles
in
scyros
the
distance
between
such
performances
magic
evocations
of
light
and
colour
and
melody
and
the
gross
buffoonery
of
the
popular
stage
still
tainted
with
the
obscenities
of
the
old
commedia
dell
arte
in
a
measure
explains
the
different
points
from
which
at
that
period
the
stage
was
viewed
in
italy
a
period
when
in
such
cities
as
milan
venice
turin
actors
and
singers
were
praised
to
the
skies
and
loaded
with
wealth
and
favours
while
the
tatterdemalion
players
who
set
up
their
boards
in
the
small
towns
at
or
on
were
despised
by
the
people
and
flung
like
carrion
into
unconsecrated
graves
the
impression
odo
had
gathered
from
don
gervaso
talk
was
of
the
provincial
stage
in
all
its
pothouse
license
but
here
was
a
spectacle
as
lofty
and
harmonious
as
some
great
religious
pageant
as
the
action
developed
and
the
beauty
of
the
verse
was
borne
to
odo
on
the
light
hurrying
ripples
of
caldara
music
he
turned
instinctively
to
share
his
pleasure
with
those
about
him
cantapresto
in
a
new
black
coat
and
ruffles
was
conspicuously
taking
snuff
from
the
tortoiseshell
box
which
the
countess
cicisbeo
had
given
him
but
odo
saw
that
he
took
less
pleasure
in
the
spectacle
than
in
the
fact
of
accompanying
the
of
pianura
to
a
gala
performance
at
the
royal
theatre
and
the
lads
about
them
were
for
the
most
part
engaged
either
with
their
own
dress
and
appearance
or
in
exchanging
greetings
with
the
royal
pages
and
the
older
students
a
few
of
these
sat
near
odo
disdainfully
superior
in
their
and
queues
and
as
the
boy
glanced
about
him
he
met
the
fixed
stare
of
one
of
the
number
a
tall
youth
seated
at
his
elbow
and
conspicuous
even
in
that
modish
company
for
the
exaggerated
elegance
of
his
dress
this
young
man
whose
awkward
bearing
and
long
face
crowned
with
flamboyant
hair
contrasted
oddly
with
his
finical
apparel
returned
odo
look
with
a
gaze
of
eager
comprehension
he
too
it
was
clear
felt
the
thrill
and
wonder
or
at
least
them
in
the
younger
lad
emotion
and
from
that
moment
odo
felt
himself
in
mute
communion
with
his
neighbour
the
quick
movement
of
the
story
the
succession
of
devices
by
which
the
wily
ulysses
lures
achilles
to
throw
off
his
disguise
while
deidamia
strives
to
conceal
his
identity
the
scenic
beauties
of
the
background
shifting
from
to
pleasance
from
pleasance
to
the
pomp
and
glitter
of
the
royal
train
the
melting
graces
of
deidamia
and
her
maidens
seemed
in
their
multiple
appeal
to
develop
in
odo
new
faculties
of
perception
it
was
his
first
initiation
into
italian
poetry
and
the
numbers
now
broken
harsh
and
passionate
now
flowing
into
liquid
sweetness
were
so
blent
with
sound
and
colour
that
he
scarce
knew
through
which
sense
they
reached
him
strophes
thrilled
him
like
the
kiss
and
at
the
young
hero
cry
ma
lo
so
ch
io
sono
achille
e
mi
sento
achille
in
sen
his
fists
tightened
and
the
blood
hummed
in
his
ears
in
the
scene
of
the
where
the
followers
of
ulysses
lay
before
lycomedes
the
offerings
of
the
greek
chieftains
and
while
the
king
and
deidamia
are
marvelling
at
the
jewels
and
the
tyrian
robes
achilles
unmindful
of
his
disguise
bursts
out
ah
chi
vide
finora
armi
piu
belle
at
this
supreme
point
odo
again
turned
to
his
neighbour
they
exchanged
another
look
and
at
the
close
of
the
act
the
youth
leaned
forward
to
ask
with
an
air
of
condescension
is
this
your
first
acquaintance
with
the
divine
metastasio
i
have
never
been
in
a
before
said
odo
reddening
the
other
smiled
you
are
fortunate
in
having
so
worthy
an
introduction
to
the
stage
many
of
our
operas
are
merely
vulgar
and
ridiculous
but
metastasio
is
a
great
poet
odo
nodded
a
breathless
assent
a
great
poet
his
new
acquaintance
resumed
and
handling
a
great
theme
but
do
you
not
suffer
from
the
silly
songs
that
perpetually
interrupt
the
flow
of
the
verse
to
me
they
are
intolerable
metastasio
might
have
been
a
great
tragic
dramatist
if
italy
would
have
let
him
but
italy
does
not
want
tragedies
she
wishes
to
be
sung
to
danced
to
made
eyes
at
flattered
and
amused
give
her
anything
anything
that
shall
help
her
to
forget
her
own
abasement
panem
et
circenses
that
is
always
her
cry
and
who
can
wonder
that
her
sovereigns
and
statesmen
are
willing
to
humour
her
when
even
her
poets
stoop
to
play
the
mountebank
for
her
diversion
the
speaker
ruffling
his
locks
with
a
hand
that
scattered
the
powder
turned
on
the
brilliant
audience
his
strange
corrugated
frown
fools
simpletons
he
cried
not
to
see
that
in
applauding
the
achilles
of
metastasio
they
are
smiling
at
the
allegory
of
their
own
abasement
what
are
the
italians
of
today
but
men
tricked
out
in
finery
when
they
should
be
waiting
to
rally
at
the
first
signal
of
revolt
oh
for
the
day
when
a
poet
shall
arise
who
dares
tell
them
the
truth
not
disguised
in
sentimental
frippery
not
ending
in
a
maudlin
reconciliation
of
love
and
glory
but
the
whole
truth
naked
cold
and
fatal
as
a
patriot
blade
a
poet
who
dares
show
these
bedizened
courtiers
they
are
no
freer
than
the
peasants
they
oppress
and
tell
the
peasants
they
are
entitled
to
the
same
privileges
as
their
masters
he
paused
and
drew
back
with
a
supercilious
smile
but
doubtless
sir
said
he
i
offend
you
in
thus
arraigning
your
sacred
caste
for
unless
i
mistake
you
belong
to
the
race
of
the
titans
whose
downfall
is
at
hand
he
swept
the
boxes
with
a
contemptuous
eye
little
of
this
tirade
was
clear
to
odo
but
something
in
the
tone
moved
him
to
answer
with
a
quick
lifting
of
his
head
my
name
is
odo
valsecca
of
the
dukes
of
pianura
when
fearing
he
had
seemed
to
parade
his
birth
before
one
evidently
of
inferior
station
he
at
once
added
with
a
touch
of
shyness
and
you
sir
are
perhaps
a
poet
since
you
speak
so
beautifully
at
which
with
a
stare
and
a
straightening
of
his
long
awkward
body
the
other
haughtily
returned
a
poet
sir
i
am
the
count
vittorio
alfieri
of
asti
the
singular
being
with
whom
chance
had
thus
brought
him
acquainted
was
to
have
a
lasting
influence
on
the
formation
of
odo
character
vittorio
alfieri
then
just
concluding
at
the
age
of
sixteen
his
desultory
years
of
academic
schooling
was
probably
the
most
extraordinary
youth
in
charles
emmanuel
dominion
of
the
future
student
of
the
tragic
poet
who
was
to
prepare
the
liberation
of
italy
by
raising
the
political
ideals
of
his
generation
this
moody
boy
with
his
craze
for
dress
and
horses
his
pride
of
birth
and
contempt
for
his
own
class
his
liberal
theories
and
insolently
aristocratic
practice
must
have
given
small
promise
to
the
most
discerning
observer
it
seems
indeed
probable
that
none
thought
him
worth
observing
and
that
he
passed
among
his
townsmen
merely
as
one
of
the
most
idle
and
extravagant
young
noblemen
in
a
society
where
idleness
and
extravagance
were
held
to
be
the
natural
attributes
of
the
great
but
in
the
growth
of
character
the
light
on
the
road
to
damascus
is
apt
to
be
preceded
by
faint
premonitory
gleams
and
even
in
his
frivolous
days
at
the
academy
alfieri
carried
a
virgil
in
his
pocket
and
wept
and
trembled
over
ariosto
verse
it
was
the
instant
response
of
odo
imagination
that
drew
the
two
together
odo
as
one
of
the
foreign
pupils
was
quartered
in
the
same
wing
of
the
academy
with
the
students
of
alfieri
class
and
enjoyed
an
almost
equal
freedom
thus
despite
the
difference
of
age
the
lads
found
themselves
allied
by
taste
and
circumstances
among
the
youth
of
their
class
they
were
perhaps
the
only
two
who
already
felt
however
obscurely
the
stirring
of
unborn
ideals
the
pressure
of
that
tide
of
renovation
that
was
to
sweep
them
on
currents
to
the
same
uncharted
deep
alfieri
at
any
rate
represented
to
the
younger
lad
the
seer
who
held
in
his
hands
the
keys
of
knowledge
and
beauty
odo
could
never
forget
the
youth
who
first
leant
him
annibale
caro
aeneid
and
metastasio
opera
libretti
voltaire
zaire
and
the
comedies
of
goldoni
while
alfieri
perhaps
found
in
his
companion
sympathy
with
his
own
tastes
the
first
incentive
to
a
nobler
activity
certain
it
is
that
in
the
interchange
of
their
daily
comradeship
the
elder
gave
his
friend
much
that
he
was
himself
unconscious
of
possessing
and
perhaps
first
saw
reflected
in
odo
more
vivid
sensibility
an
outline
of
the
formless
ideals
coiled
in
the
depths
of
his
own
sluggish
nature
the
difference
in
age
and
the
possession
of
an
independent
fortune
which
the
laws
of
savoy
had
left
alfieri
free
to
enjoy
since
his
fifteenth
year
gave
him
an
obvious
superiority
over
odo
but
if
alfieri
amusements
separated
him
from
his
young
friend
his
tastes
were
always
drawing
them
together
and
odo
was
happily
of
those
who
are
more
engaged
in
profiting
by
what
comes
their
way
than
in
pining
for
what
escapes
them
much
as
he
admired
alfieri
it
was
somehow
impossible
for
the
latter
to
condescend
to
him
and
the
equality
of
intercourse
between
the
two
was
perhaps
its
chief
attraction
to
a
youth
surfeited
with
adulation
of
the
opportunities
his
new
friendship
brought
him
none
became
in
after
years
a
pleasanter
memory
to
odo
than
his
visits
with
vittorio
to
the
latter
uncle
the
illustrious
architect
count
benedetto
alfieri
this
accomplished
and
amiable
man
who
had
for
many
years
devoted
his
talents
to
the
king
service
was
lodged
in
a
palace
adjoining
the
academy
and
thither
one
holiday
afternoon
vittorio
conducted
his
young
friend
ignorant
as
odo
was
of
all
the
arts
he
felt
on
the
very
threshold
the
new
quality
of
his
surroundings
these
tall
bare
rooms
where
busts
and
sarcophagi
were
ranged
as
in
the
twilight
of
a
temple
diffused
an
influence
that
lowered
the
voice
and
hushed
the
step
in
the
capital
where
french
architects
designed
the
and
the
nobility
imported
their
from
paris
and
their
damask
hangings
from
lyons
benedetto
alfieri
represented
the
old
classic
tradition
the
tradition
of
the
grand
manner
which
had
held
its
own
through
all
later
variations
of
taste
running
parallel
with
the
barocchismo
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
the
effeminate
caprices
of
the
rococo
period
he
had
lived
much
in
rome
in
the
company
of
men
like
winckelmann
and
maffei
in
that
society
where
the
revival
of
classical
research
was
being
forwarded
by
the
liberality
of
princes
and
cardinals
and
by
the
indefatigable
zeal
of
the
scholars
in
their
pay
from
this
centre
of
aesthetic
reaction
alfieri
had
returned
to
the
gallicized
turin
with
its
preference
for
the
graceful
and
ingenious
rather
than
for
the
large
the
noble
the
restrained
bringing
to
bear
on
the
taste
of
his
native
city
the
influence
of
a
view
raised
but
perhaps
narrowed
by
close
study
of
the
past
the
view
of
a
generation
of
architects
in
whom
archeological
curiosity
had
stifled
the
artistic
instinct
and
who
instead
of
assimilating
the
spirit
of
the
past
like
their
great
predecessors
were
engrossed
in
a
sterile
restoration
of
the
letter
it
may
be
said
of
this
school
of
architects
that
they
were
of
more
service
to
posterity
than
to
their
contemporaries
for
while
they
opened
the
way
to
modern
antiquarian
research
their
pedantry
checked
the
natural
development
of
a
style
which
if
left
to
itself
might
in
time
have
found
new
and
more
vigorous
forms
of
expression
to
odo
happily
count
benedetto
surroundings
spoke
more
forcibly
than
his
theories
every
object
in
the
calm
severe
rooms
appealed
to
the
boy
with
the
pure
eloquence
of
form
casts
of
the
vatican
busts
stood
against
the
walls
and
a
niche
at
one
end
of
the
library
contained
a
marble
copy
of
the
apollo
belvedere
the
sarcophagi
with
their
winged
genii
their
garlands
and
bucranes
and
porphyry
tazzas
the
fragments
of
roman
mosaic
and
pompeian
roused
odo
curiosity
as
if
they
had
been
the
scattered
letters
of
a
new
alphabet
and
he
saw
with
astonishment
his
friend
vittorio
indifference
to
these
wonders
count
benedetto
it
was
clear
was
resigned
to
his
nephew
lack
of
interest
the
old
man
doubtless
knew
that
he
represented
to
the
youth
only
the
rich
uncle
whose
crotchets
must
be
humoured
for
the
sake
of
what
his
pocket
may
procure
and
such
kindly
tolerance
made
odo
regret
that
vittorio
should
not
at
least
affect
an
interest
in
his
pursuits
odo
eagerness
to
see
and
learn
filled
count
benedetto
with
a
simple
joy
he
brought
forth
all
his
treasures
for
the
boy
instruction
and
the
two
spent
many
an
afternoon
poring
over
piranesi
roman
etchings
maffei
verona
illustrata
and
count
benedetto
own
elegant
of
classical
remains
like
all
students
of
his
day
he
had
also
his
cabinet
of
antique
gems
and
coins
from
which
odo
obtained
more
intimate
glimpses
of
that
buried
life
so
marvellously
exhumed
before
him
hints
of
traffic
in
and
familiar
gestures
of
hands
on
which
those
very
jewels
might
have
sparkled
nor
did
the
count
restrict
the
boy
enquiries
to
that
distant
past
and
for
the
first
time
odo
heard
of
the
masters
who
had
maintained
the
great
classical
tradition
on
latin
soil
sanmichele
vignola
sansovino
and
the
divine
michael
angelo
whom
the
old
architect
never
named
without
baring
his
head
from
the
works
of
these
architects
odo
formed
his
first
conception
of
the
earlier
more
virile
manner
which
the
first
contact
with
antiquity
had
produced
the
count
told
him
too
of
the
great
painters
whose
popularity
had
been
lessened
if
their
fame
had
not
been
dimmed
by
the
more
recent
achievements
of
correggio
guido
guercino
and
the
bolognese
school
the
splendour
of
the
stanze
of
the
vatican
the
dreadful
majesty
of
the
sistine
ceiling
revealed
to
odo
the
beauty
of
that
unmatched
moment
before
grandeur
broke
into
bombast
his
early
association
with
the
expressive
homely
art
of
the
chapel
at
pontesordo
and
with
the
beauty
of
luini
compositions
had
formed
his
taste
on
soberer
lines
than
the
fashion
of
the
day
affected
and
his
imagination
breathed
freely
on
the
heights
of
the
latin
parnassus
thus
while
his
friend
vittorio
stormed
up
and
down
the
quiet
rooms
chattering
about
his
horses
boasting
of
his
escapades
or
ranting
against
the
tyranny
of
the
sardinian
government
odo
at
the
old
count
side
was
entering
on
the
great
inheritance
of
the
past
such
an
initiation
was
the
more
precious
to
him
from
the
indifference
of
those
about
him
to
all
forms
of
liberal
culture
among
the
greater
italian
cities
turin
was
at
that
period
the
least
open
to
new
influences
the
most
rigidly
bound
up
in
the
formulas
of
the
past
while
milan
under
the
austrian
rule
was
becoming
a
centre
of
philosophic
thought
while
naples
was
producing
a
group
of
economists
such
as
galiani
gravina
and
filangieri
while
ecclesiastical
rome
was
dedicating
herself
to
the
investigation
of
ancient
art
and
polity
and
even
flighty
venice
had
her
little
set
of
liberals
who
read
voltaire
and
hume
and
wept
over
the
rights
of
man
the
old
piedmontese
capital
lay
in
the
grasp
of
a
bigoted
clergy
and
of
a
reigning
house
which
was
already
preparing
to
superimpose
prussian
militarism
on
the
old
feudal
discipline
of
the
border
generations
of
hard
fighting
and
rigorous
living
had
developed
in
the
nobles
the
qualities
which
were
preparing
them
for
the
great
part
their
country
was
to
play
and
contact
with
the
waldensian
and
calvinist
heresies
had
stiffened
piedmontese
piety
into
a
sombre
hatred
of
schism
and
a
minute
observance
of
the
mechanical
rules
of
the
faith
such
qualities
could
be
produced
only
at
the
expense
of
intellectual
freedom
and
if
piedmont
could
show
a
few
nobles
like
massimo
father
who
made
the
education
of
his
children
his
first
and
gravest
thought
and
supplemented
the
deficiencies
of
his
wife
conventual
training
by
consecrating
to
her
daily
four
hours
of
reading
translating
and
other
suitable
exercises
the
commoner
view
was
that
of
alfieri
own
parents
who
frequently
repeated
in
their
son
hearing
the
old
maxim
of
the
piedmontese
nobility
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
gentleman
to
be
a
scholar
such
at
any
rate
was
the
opinion
of
the
old
marquess
of
donnaz
and
of
all
the
frequenters
of
casa
valdu
odo
stepfather
was
engrossed
in
the
fulfilment
of
his
duties
about
the
court
and
donna
laura
under
the
influence
of
poverty
and
ennui
had
sunk
into
a
state
of
rigid
pietism
so
that
the
lad
on
his
visits
to
his
mother
found
himself
in
a
world
where
art
was
represented
by
the
latest
of
a
court
beauty
literature
by
liguori
glories
of
mary
or
the
blessed
battista
mental
sorrows
of
christ
and
history
by
the
conviction
that
piedmont
efforts
to
stamp
out
the
enemies
of
the
church
had
distinguished
her
above
every
other
country
of
europe
donna
laura
cicisbeo
was
indeed
a
member
of
the
local
arcadia
and
given
to
celebrating
in
verse
every
incident
in
the
noble
household
of
valdu
from
its
lady
to
the
death
of
a
pet
canary
but
his
own
tastes
inclined
to
the
elegant
bettinelli
whose
lettere
virgiliane
had
so
conclusively
shown
dante
to
be
a
writer
of
barbarous
doggerel
and
among
the
dilettanti
of
the
day
one
heard
less
of
raphael
than
of
carlo
maratta
less
of
ariosto
and
petrarch
than
of
the
jesuit
poet
padre
cevo
author
of
the
sublime
poem
on
the
infancy
of
jesus
it
was
in
fact
mainly
to
the
jesuits
that
italy
in
the
early
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
owed
her
literature
and
her
art
as
well
as
the
direction
of
her
religious
life
though
the
reaction
against
the
order
was
everywhere
making
itself
felt
though
one
italian
sovereign
after
another
had
been
constrained
to
purchase
popularity
or
even
security
by
banishing
the
society
from
his
dominions
the
jesuits
maintained
their
hold
on
the
aristocracy
whose
pretentions
they
flattered
whose
tastes
they
affected
and
to
whom
they
represented
the
spirit
of
religious
and
political
conservatism
against
which
invisible
forces
were
already
felt
to
be
moving
for
the
use
of
their
noble
supporters
the
jesuits
had
devised
a
religion
as
elaborate
and
ceremonious
as
the
social
usages
of
the
aristocracy
a
religion
which
decked
its
chapels
in
imitation
of
great
ladies
boudoirs
and
prescribed
observances
in
keeping
with
the
vapid
and
gossiping
existence
of
their
inmates
to
odo
fresh
from
the
pure
air
of
donnaz
where
the
faith
of
his
kinsfolk
expressed
itself
in
charity
and
a
noble
decency
of
life
there
was
something
stifling
in
the
atmosphere
of
languishing
pietism
in
which
his
mother
friends
veiled
the
emptiness
of
their
days
under
the
instruction
of
the
countess
director
the
conscience
was
enervated
by
the
casuistries
of
liguorianism
and
his
devotion
dulled
by
the
imposition
of
interminable
pious
practices
it
was
in
his
nature
to
grudge
no
sacrifice
to
his
ideals
and
he
might
have
accomplished
without
question
the
monotonous
observances
his
confessor
exacted
but
for
the
changed
aspect
of
the
deity
in
whose
name
they
were
imposed
as
with
most
thoughtful
natures
odo
first
disillusionment
was
to
come
from
discovering
not
what
his
god
condemned
but
what
he
condoned
between
cantapresto
coarse
philosophy
of
pleasure
and
the
refined
complaisances
of
his
new
confessor
he
felt
the
distinction
to
be
one
rather
of
taste
than
of
principle
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
religion
of
the
aristocracy
might
not
unfairly
be
summed
up
in
the
cynical
aphorism
as
respectful
children
of
our
heavenly
father
it
behoves
us
not
to
speak
till
we
are
spoken
to
even
the
religious
ceremonies
he
witnessed
did
not
console
him
for
that
chill
hour
of
dawn
when
in
the
chapel
at
donnaz
he
had
served
the
mass
for
don
gervaso
with
a
heart
trembling
at
its
own
unworthiness
yet
uplifted
by
the
sense
of
the
divine
presence
in
the
churches
adorned
like
aristocratic
of
which
some
madonna
wreathed
in
artificial
flowers
seemed
the
amiable
and
indulgent
hostess
and
where
the
florid
passionate
music
of
the
mass
was
rendered
by
the
king
opera
singers
before
a
throng
of
chattering
cavaliers
and
ladies
odo
prayed
in
vain
for
a
reawakening
of
the
old
emotion
the
sense
of
sonship
was
gone
he
felt
himself
an
alien
in
the
temple
of
this
affable
divinity
and
his
heart
echoed
no
more
than
the
cry
which
had
once
lifted
him
on
wings
of
praise
to
the
very
threshold
of
the
hidden
glory
domine
dilexi
decorem
domus
tuae
et
locum
habitationis
gloriae
tuae
it
was
in
the
first
reaction
from
this
dimly
felt
loss
that
he
lit
one
day
on
a
volume
which
alfieri
had
smuggled
into
the
academy
the
lettres
philosophiques
of
francois
arouet
de
voltaire
book

the
new

one
afternoon
of
april
in
the
year
odo
valsecca
riding
down
the
hillside
below
the
church
of
the
superga
had
reined
in
his
horse
at
a
point
where
a
group
of
spanish
chestnuts
overhung
the
way
the
air
was
light
and
pure
the
shady
turf
invited
him
and
dismounting
he
bid
his
servant
lead
the
horses
to
the
wayside
inn
half
way
down
the
slope
the
spot
he
had
chosen
though
secluded
as
some
nook
above
the
gorge
of
donnaz
commanded
a
view
of
the
po
rolling
at
his
feet
like
a
flood
of
yellowish
metal
and
beyond
outspread
in
clear
spring
sunshine
the
great
city
in
the
bosom
of
the
plain
the
spectacle
was
fair
enough
to
touch
any
fancy
brown
domes
and
facades
set
in
gardens
and
surrounded
by
vineyards
extending
to
the
nearest
acclivities
glancing
through
the
fresh
green
of
planes
and
willows
cresting
the
higher
ridges
and
westward
the
po
winding
in
sunlit
curves
toward
the
alps
odo
had
lost
none
of
his
sensitiveness
to
such
impressions
but
the
sway
of
another
mood
turned
his
eye
from
the
outstretched
beauty
of
the
city
to
the
vernal
solitude
about
him
it
was
the
season
when
old
memories
of
donnaz
worked
in
his
blood
when
the
banks
and
hedges
of
the
fresh
about
turin
cheated
him
with
a
breath
of
budding
and
the
fragrance
of
crushed
fern
in
the
glens
of
the
high
pennine
valleys
it
was
a
mere
waft
perhaps
from
some
clod
of
loosened
earth
or
the
touch
of
cool
elastic
moss
as
he
flung
himself
face
downward
under
the
trees
but
the
savour
the
contact
filled
his
nostrils
with
mountain
air
and
his
eyes
with
distances
at
donnaz
the
slow
motions
of
the
northern
spring
had
endeared
to
him
all
those
sweet
incipiencies
preceding
the
full
choral
burst
of
leaf
and
flower
the
mauve
mist
over
bare
woodlands
the
wet
black
gleams
in
hollows
the
thrust
of
fronds
through
withered
bracken
the
spreading
like
pale
sunshine
along
wintry
lanes
he
had
always
felt
a
sympathy
for
these
delicate
unnoted
changes
but
the
feeling
which
had
formerly
been
like
the
blind
stir
of
sap
in
a
plant
was
now
a
conscious
sensation
that
groped
for
speech
and
understanding
he
had
grown
up
among
people
to
whom
such
emotions
were
unknown
the
old
marquess
passion
for
his
fields
and
woods
was
the
love
of
the
agriculturist
and
the
hunter
not
that
of
the
naturalist
or
the
poet
and
the
aristocracy
of
the
cities
regarded
the
country
merely
as
so
much
soil
from
which
to
draw
their
maintenance
the
gentlefolk
never
absented
themselves
from
town
but
for
a
few
weeks
of
autumn
when
they
went
to
their
villas
for
the
vintage
transporting
thither
all
the
diversions
of
city
life
and
venturing
no
farther
afield
than
the
that
were
but
so
many
and
theatres
tenderness
for
every
sylvan
function
of
renewal
and
decay
every
shifting
of
light
and
colour
on
the
flying
surface
of
the
year
would
have
been
met
with
the
same
stare
with
which
a
certain
enchanting
countess
had
received
the
handful
of
that
fresh
from
a
sunrise
on
the
hills
he
had
laid
one
morning
among
her
the
countess
clarice
had
stared
and
laughed
and
every
one
of
his
acquaintance
alfieri
even
would
have
echoed
her
laugh
but
one
man
at
least
had
felt
the
divine
commotion
of
nature
touch
had
felt
and
interpreted
it
in
words
as
fresh
as
spring
verdure
in
the
pages
of
a
volume
that
odo
now
drew
from
his
pocket
i
longed
to
dream
but
some
unexpected
spectacle
continually
distracted
me
from
my
musings
here
immense
rocks
hung
their
ruinous
masses
above
my
head
there
the
thick
mist
of
roaring
waterfalls
enveloped
me
or
some
unceasing
torrent
tore
open
at
my
very
feet
an
abyss
into
which
the
gaze
feared
to
plunge
sometimes
i
was
lost
in
the
twilight
of
a
thick
wood
sometimes
on
emerging
from
a
dark
ravine
my
eyes
were
charmed
by
the
sight
of
an
open
meadow
nature
seemed
to
revel
in
unwonted
contrasts
such
varieties
of
aspect
had
she
united
in
one
spot
here
was
an
eastern
prospect
bright
with
spring
flowers
while
autumn
fruits
ripened
to
the
south
and
the
northern
face
of
the
scene
was
still
locked
in
wintry
frosts
add
to
this
the
different
angles
at
which
the
peaks
took
the
light
the
chiaroscuro
of
sun
and
shade
and
the
variations
of
light
resulting
from
it
at
morning
and
evening
sum
up
the
impressions
i
have
tried
to
describe
and
you
will
be
able
to
form
an
idea
of
the
enchanting
situation
in
which
i
found
myself
the
scene
has
indeed
a
magical
a
supernatural
quality
which
so
ravishes
the
spirit
and
senses
that
one
seems
to
lose
all
exact
notion
of
one
surroundings
and
identity
this
was
a
new
language
to
readers
already
it
had
swept
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
france
like
a
spring
bursting
open
doors
and
windows
and
filling
close
rooms
with
wet
gusts
and
the
scent
of
beaten
blossoms
but
south
of
the
alps
the
new
ideas
travelled
slowly
and
the
piedmontese
were
as
yet
scarce
aware
of
the
man
who
had
written
thus
of
their
own
mountains
it
was
true
that
some
thirty
years
earlier
in
one
of
the
very
monasteries
on
which
odo
now
looked
down
a
swiss
vagrant
called
rousseau
had
embraced
the
true
faith
with
the
most
moving
signs
of
edification
but
the
rescue
of
helvetian
heretics
was
a
favourite
occupation
of
the
turinese
nobility
and
it
is
doubtful
if
any
recalled
the
name
of
the
strange
proselyte
who
had
hastened
to
signalise
his
conversion
by
robbing
his
employers
and
slandering
an
innocent
odo
in
fact
owed
his
first
acquaintance
with
the
french
writers
to
alfieri
who
in
the
intervals
of
his
wandering
over
europe
now
and
then
reappeared
in
turin
laden
with
the
latest
novelties
in
transalpine
literature
and
haberdashery
what
his
eccentric
friend
failed
to
provide
odo
had
little
difficulty
in
obtaining
for
himself
for
though
most
of
the
new
writers
were
on
the
index
and
the
sardinian
censorship
was
notoriously
severe
there
was
never
yet
a
barrier
that
could
keep
out
books
and
cantapresto
was
a
skilled
purveyor
of
contraband
dainties
odo
had
thus
acquainted
himself
with
the
lighter
literature
of
england
and
france
and
though
he
had
read
but
few
philosophical
treatises
was
yet
dimly
aware
of
the
new
standpoint
from
which
north
of
the
alps
men
were
beginning
to
test
the
accepted
forms
of
thought
the
first
disturbance
of
his
childish
faith
and
the
coincident
reading
of
the
lettres
philosophiques
had
been
followed
by
a
period
of
moral
perturbation
during
which
he
suffered
from
that
sense
of
bewilderment
of
inability
to
classify
the
phenomena
of
life
that
is
one
of
the
keenest
trials
of
inexperience
youth
and
nature
had
their
way
with
him
however
and
a
wholesome
reaction
of
indifference
set
in
the
invisible
world
of
thought
and
conduct
had
been
the
frequent
subject
of
his
musings
but
the
other
tangible
world
was
close
to
him
too
spreading
like
a
rich
populous
plain
between
himself
and
the
distant
heights
of
speculation
the
old
doubts
the
old
dissatisfactions
hung
on
the
edge
of
consciousness
but
he
was
too
profoundly
italian
not
to
linger
awhile
in
that
atmosphere
of
careless
acquiescence
that
is
so
pleasant
a
medium
for
the
unhampered
enjoyment
of
life
some
day
no
doubt
the
intellectual
curiosity
and
the
moral
disquietude
would
revive
but
what
he
wanted
now
were
books
which
appealed
not
to
his
reason
but
to
his
emotions
which
reflected
as
in
a
mirror
the
rich
and
varied
life
of
the
senses
books
that
were
warm
to
the
touch
like
the
little
volume
in
his
hand
for
it
was
not
only
of
nature
that
the
book
spoke
amid
scenes
of
such
rustic
freshness
were
set
human
passions
as
fresh
and
natural
a
great
romantic
love
subdued
to
duty
yet
breaking
forth
again
and
again
as
young
shoots
spring
from
the
root
of
a
felled
tree
to
readers
such
a
picture
of
life
was
as
new
as
its
setting
duty
in
that
day
to
people
of
quality
meant
the
observance
of
certain
fixed
conventions
the
correct
stepping
of
a
moral
minuet
as
an
inner
obligation
as
a
voluntary
tribute
to
diderot
divinity
on
earth
it
had
hardly
yet
drawn
breath
to
depict
a
personal
relation
so
much
purer
and
more
profound
than
any
form
of
sentiment
then
in
fashion
and
then
to
subordinate
it
unflinchingly
to
the
ideal
of
those
larger
relations
that
link
the
individual
to
the
group
this
was
a
stroke
of
originality
for
which
it
would
be
hard
to
find
a
parallel
in
modern
fiction
here
at
last
was
an
answer
to
the
blind
impulses
agrope
in
odo
breast
the
loosening
of
those
springs
of
emotion
that
gushed
forth
in
such
fresh
contrast
to
the
stagnant
rills
of
the
sentimental
to
renounce
a
julie
would
be
more
thrilling
than
odo
with
a
sigh
thrust
the
book
in
his
pocket
and
rose
to
his
feet
it
was
the
hour
of
the
promenade
at
the
valentino
and
he
had
promised
the
countess
clarice
to
attend
her
the
old
palace
of
the
french
princess
lay
below
him
in
its
gardens
along
the
river
he
could
figure
as
he
looked
down
on
it
the
throng
of
carriages
and
chairs
the
modishly
dressed
riders
the
pedestrians
crowding
the
footpath
to
watch
the
quality
go
by
the
vision
of
all
that
noise
and
glitter
deepened
the
sweetness
of
the
woodland
hush
he
sighed
again
suddenly
voices
sounded
in
the
road
below
a
man
speech
flecked
with
girlish
laughter
odo
hung
back
listening
the
girl
voice
rang
like
a
through
his
rustling
fancies
presently
she
came
in
sight
a
slender
figure
hung
on
the
arm
of
an
elderly
man
in
the
sober
dress
of
one
of
the
learned
professions
a
physician
or
a
lawyer
odo
guessed
their
being
afoot
and
the
style
of
the
man
dress
showed
that
they
were
of
the
middle
class
their
demeanour
that
they
were
father
and
daughter
the
girl
moved
with
a
light
forward
flowing
of
her
whole
body
that
seemed
the
pledge
of
grace
in
every
limb
of
her
face
odo
had
but
a
bright
glimpse
in
the
eclipse
of
her
flapping
she
stood
under
his
tree
unheeded
but
as
they
rose
abreast
of
him
the
girl
paused
and
dropped
her
companion
arm
look
the
cherry
flowers
she
cried
and
stretched
her
arms
to
a
white
gush
of
blossoms
above
the
wall
across
the
road
the
movement
tilted
back
her
hat
and
odo
caught
her
small
fine
profile
as
the
head
on
some
sicilian
coin
with
a
little
ear
bedded
in
dark
ripples
oh
she
wailed
straining
on
tiptoe
i
ca
reach
them
her
father
smiled
may
temptation
said
he
philosophically
always
hang
as
far
out
of
your
reach
temptation
she
echoed
is
it
not
theft
you
bent
on
theft
this
is
a
monk
orchard
not
a
peasant
plot
confiscation
then
he
humorously
conceded
since
they
pay
no
taxes
on
their
cherries
they
might
at
least
she
argued
spare
a
few
to
us
poor
taxpayers
ah
said
her
father
i
want
to
tax
their
cherries
not
to
gather
them
he
slipped
a
hand
through
her
arm
come
child
said
he
does
not
the
philosopher
tell
us
that
he
who
enjoys
a
thing
possesses
it
the
flowers
are
yours
already
oh
are
they
she
retorted
then
why
does
the
loaf
in
the
window
feed
the
beggar
that
looks
in
at
it
casuist
he
cried
and
drew
her
up
the
bend
of
the
road
odo
stood
gazing
after
them
their
words
their
aspect
seemed
an
echo
of
his
reading
the
father
in
his
plain
broadcloth
and
shoes
the
daughter
with
her
unpowdered
hair
and
spreading
hat
might
have
stepped
from
the
pages
of
the
romance
what
a
breath
of
freshness
they
brought
with
them
the
girl
cheek
was
clear
as
the
and
with
what
lovely
freedom
did
she
move
thus
julie
might
have
led
saint
preux
through
her
elysium
odo
crossed
the
road
and
breaking
one
of
the
blossoming
twigs
thrust
it
in
the
breast
of
his
uniform
then
he
walked
down
the
hill
to
the
inn
where
the
horses
waited
half
an
hour
later
he
rode
up
to
the
house
where
he
lodged
in
the
piazza
san
carlo

the
archway

with

cantapresto
was
he
in
good
health
does
he
sup
at
home
he
left
no
message
quick
antonio
a
chair
he
cried
with
his
hand
on
the
door
odo
had
acquired
at
a
nobility
of
carriage
not
incompatible
with
the
boyish
candour
of
his
gaze
and
becomingly
set
off
by
the
brilliant
of
a
lieutenant
in
one
of
the
provincial
regiments
he
was
tall
and
fair
and
a
certain
languor
of
complexion
inherited
from
his
father
house
was
corrected
in
him
by
the
vivacity
of
the
donnaz
blood
this
now
sparkled
in
his
grey
eye
and
gave
a
glow
to
his
cheek
as
he
stepped
across
the
threshold
treading
on
a
sprig
of
that
had
dropped
unnoticed
to
the
floor
cantapresto
looking
after
him
caught
sight
of
the
flowers
and
kicked
them
aside
with
a
contemptuous
toe
i
sometimes

he

he
murmured
with
a
shrug
the
lord
knows
what
queer
notions
he
gets
out
of
all
these
books
as
an
infusion
of
fresh
blood
to
odo
were
alfieri
meteoric
returns
to
turin
life
moved
languidly
in
the
city
even
to
a
young
gentleman
for
adventure
and
framed
to
elicit
it
as
the
draws
water
not
that
vulgar
distractions
were
lacking
the
town
as
cantapresto
had
long
since
advised
him
had
its
secret
leniencies
its
posterns
opening
on
clandestine
pleasure
but
there
was
that
in
odo
which
early
turned
him
from
such
cheap
counterfeits
of
living
he
accepted
the
diversions
of
his
age
but
with
a
clear
sense
of
their
worth
and
the
youth
who
calls
his
pleasures
by
their
true
name
has
learned
the
secret
of
resisting
them
alfieri
coming
set
deeper
springs
in
motion
his
follies
and
extravagances
were
on
a
less
provincial
scale
than
those
of
odo
daily
associates
the
breath
of
a
freer
life
clung
to
him
and
his
allusions
were
so
many
glimpses
into
a
larger
world
his
political
theories
were
but
the
enlargement
of
his
private
grievances
but
the
mere
play
of
criticism
on
accepted
institutions
was
an
exercise
more
novel
and
exhilirating
than
the
wildest
ride
on
one
of
his
still
chiefly
a
man
of
pleasure
and
the
slave
as
always
of
some
rash
infatuation
alfieri
was
already
shaking
off
the
intellectual
torpor
of
his
youth
and
the
first
stirrings
of
his
curiosity
roused
an
answering
passion
in
odo
their
tastes
were
indeed
divergent
for
to
that
external
beauty
which
was
to
odo
the
very
bloom
of
life
alfieri
remained
insensible
while
of
its
imaginative
counterpart
its
prolongation
in
the
realm
of
thought
and
emotion
he
had
but
the
most
limited
conception
but
his
love
of
ringing
deeds
woke
the
chivalrous
strain
in
odo
and
his
vague
celebration
of
liberty
that
unknown
goddess
to
whom
altars
were
everywhere
building
chimed
with
the
other
scorn
of
oppression
and
injustice
so
far
it
is
true
their
companionship
had
been
mainly
one
of
pleasure
but
the
temper
of
both
gave
their
follies
that
provisional
character
which
saves
them
from
vulgarity
odo
who
had
slept
late
on
the
morning
after
his
friend
return
was
waked
by
the
pompous
mouthing
of
certain
lines
just
then
on
every
lip
in
italy
meet
was
it
that
its
ancient
seats
forsaking
an
empire
should
set
forth
with
dauntless
sail
and
braving
tempests
and
the
deep
betrayal
break
down
the
barriers
of
inviolate
worlds
that
cortez
and
pizarro
should
esteem
the
blood
of
man
a
trivial
sacrifice
when
flinging
down
from
their
ancestral
thrones
incas
and
mexicans
of
royal
line
they
wrecked
two
kingdoms
to
refresh
thy
palate
they
were
the
verses
in
which
the
abate
parini
in
his
satire
of
the
morning
apostrophizes
the
cup
of
chocolate
which
the
lacquey
presents
to
his
master
cantapresto
had
in
fact
just
entered
with
a
cup
of
this
beverage
and
alfieri
who
stood
at
his
friend
bedside
with
unpowdered
locks
and
a
fashionable
undress
of
parisian
cut
snatching
the
tray
from
the
soprano
hands
presented
it
to
odo
in
an
attitude
of
mock
servility
the
young
man
sprang
up
laughing
it
was
the
fashion
to
applaud
verse
in
the
circles
at
which
his
satire
was
aimed
and
none
recited
his
mock
heroics
with
greater
zest
than
the
young
gentlemen
whose
fopperies
he
ridiculed
odo
toilet
was
indeed
a
rite
almost
as
elaborate
as
that
of
parini
hero
and
this
accomplished
he
was
on
his
way
to
fulfil
the
very
duty
the
poet
most
unsparingly
derides
the
morning
visit
of
the
cicisbeo
to
his
lady
but
meanwhile
he
liked
to
show
himself
above
the
follies
of
his
class
by
joining
in
the
laugh
against
them
when
he
issued
from
the
in
his
uniform
with
scented
gloves
and
queue
he
presented
the
image
of
a
young
gentleman
so
clearly
equal
to
the
most
flattering
emergencies
that
alfieri
broke
into
a
smile
of
approval
i
see
my
dear
cavaliere
that
it
were
idle
to
invite
you
to
try
one
of
the
new
arabs
i
have
brought
with
me
from
spain
since
it
is
plain
other
duties
engage
you
but
i
come
to
lay
claim
to
your
evening
odo
hesitated
the
queen
holds
a
circle
this
evening
he
said
and
her
is
in
attendance
returned
alfieri
and
the
also
odo
made
an
impatient
movement
what
inducements
do
you
offer
said
he
carelessly
alfieri
stepped
close
and
tapped
him
on
the
sleeve
meet
me
at
ten
at
the
turn
of
the
lane
behind
the
corpus
domini
wear
a
cloak
and
a
mask
and
leave
this
gentleman
at
home
with
a
flask
of
asti
he
glanced
at
cantapresto
odo
hesitated
a
moment
he
knew
well
enough
where
such
midnight
turnings
led
and
across
the
vision
evoked
by
his
friend
words
a
girl
face
flitted
suddenly
is
that
all
he
said
with
a
shrug
you
find
me
i
fear
in
no
humour
for
such
exploits
alfieri
smiled
and
if
i
say
that
i
have
promised
to
bring
you
promised
to
one
as
chary
of
exacting
such
pledges
as
i
of
giving
them
if
i
say
that
you
stake
your
life
on
the
adventure
and
that
the
stake
is
not
too
great
for
the
reward
his
sallow
face
had
reddened
with
excitement
and
odo
forehead
reflected
the
flush
was
it
possible
but
the
thought
set
him
tingling
with
disgust
why
you
say
little
he
cried
lightly
at
the
rate
at
which
i
value
my
life
alfieri
turned
on
him
if
your
life
is
worthless
make
it
worth
something
he
exclaimed
i
offer
you
the
opportunity
tonight
what
opportunity
the
sight
of
a
face
that
men
have
laid
down
their
lives
to
see
odo
laughed
and
buckled
on
his
sword
if
you
answer
for
the
risk
i
agree
to
take
it
said
he
at
ten
then
behind
the
corpus
domini
if
the
ladies
whom
gallant
gentlemen
delight
to
serve
could
guess
what
secret
touchstones
of
worth
these
same
gentlemen
sometimes
carry
into
the
adored
presence
many
a
handsome
head
would
be
carried
with
less
assurance
and
many
a
fond
exaction
less
confidently
imposed
if
for
instance
the
countess
clarice
di
tournanches
whose
image
reflected
itself
so
complacently
in
her
venetian
could
have
known
that
the
cavaliere
odo
valsecca
devoted
glance
saw
her
through
the
medium
of
a
countenance
compared
to
which
her
own
revealed
the
most
unexpected
shortcomings
she
might
have
received
him
with
less
airy
petulance
of
manner
but
how
could
so
accomplished
a
mistress
doubt
the
permanence
of
her
rule
the
countess
clarice
in
singling
out
young
odo
valsecca
to
the
despair
of
a
score
of
more
experienced
cavaliers
had
done
him
an
honour
that
she
could
no
more
imagine
his
resigning
than
an
adventurer
a
throne
to
which
he
is
unexpectedly
raised
she
was
a
finished
example
of
the
pretty
woman
who
views
the
universe
as
planned
for
her
convenience
what
could
go
wrong
in
a
world
where
noble
ladies
lived
in
palaces
hung
with
tapestry
and
damask
with
powdered
lacqueys
to
wait
on
them
a
turbaned
blackamoor
to
tend
their
parrots
and
monkeys
a
at
the
door
to
carry
them
to
mass
or
the
ridotto
and
a
handsome
cicisbeo
to
display
on
the
promenade
everything
had
combined
to
strengthen
the
countess
clarice
faith
in
the
existing
order
of
things
her
husband
count
roberto
di
tournanches
was
one
of
the
king
equerries
and
distinguished
for
his
brilliant
career
as
an
officer
of
the
piedmontese
army
a
man
marked
for
the
highest
favours
in
a
society
where
military
influences
were
paramount
passing
at
sixteen
from
an
aristocratic
convent
to
the
dreary
magnificence
of
the
palazzo
tournanches
clarice
had
found
herself
a
at
the
dullest
court
in
europe
and
the
wife
of
an
army
officer
engrossed
in
his
profession
and
pledged
by
etiquette
to
the
service
of
another
lady
odo
valsecca
represented
her
escape
from
this
bondage
the
dash
of
romance
and
folly
in
a
life
of
elegant
formalities
and
the
countess
who
would
not
have
sacrificed
to
him
one
of
her
rights
as
a
or
a
nobil
donna
of
the
golden
book
regarded
him
as
the
reward
which
providence
accords
to
a
conduct
her
room
when
odo
entered
it
on
taking
leave
of
alfieri
was
crowded
as
usual
at
that
hour
with
the
of
the
noble
lady
lever
the
abatino
in
lace
ruffles
handing
about
his
latest
rhymed
acrostic
the
jeweller
displaying
a
set
of
enamelled
buckles
newly
imported
from
paris
and
the
doctor
with
white
bands
who
concocted
remedies
for
the
countess
vapours
and
megrims
these
personages
grouped
about
the
where
the
countess
sat
under
the
hands
of
a
parisian
hairdresser
were
picturesquely
relieved
against
the
stucco
panelling
and
narrow
mirrors
of
the
apartment
with
its
windows
looking
on
a
garden
set
with
mossy
statues
to
odo
however
the
scene
suggested
the
most
tedious
part
of
his
day
routine
the
compliments
to
be
exchanged
the
silly
verses
to
be
praised
the
gewgaws
from
paris
to
be
admired
were
all
contrasted
in
his
mind
with
the
vision
of
that
other
life
which
had
come
to
him
on
the
hillside
of
the
superga
on
this
mood
the
countess
clarice
sarcasms
fell
without
effect
to
be
pouted
at
because
he
had
failed
to
attend
the
promenade
of
the
valentino
was
to
odo
but
a
convenient
pretext
for
excusing
himself
from
the
circle
that
evening
he
had
engaged
with
little
ardour
to
join
alfieri
in
what
he
guessed
to
be
a
sufficiently
commonplace
adventure
but
as
he
listened
to
the
countess
chatter
about
the
last
and
the
relative
merits
of
sanspareil
water
and
of
gloves
from
blois
and
vendome
his
impatience
hailed
any
alternative
as
a
release
meanwhile
however
long
hours
of
servitude
intervened
the
toilet
completed
to
the
adjusting
of
the
last
patch
he
must
attend
her
to
dinner
where
placed
at
her
side
he
was
awarded
the
honour
of
carving
the
roast
must
sit
through
two
hours
of
biribi
in
company
with
the
abatino
the
doctor
and
parasites
of
the
noble
table
and
for
two
hours
more
must
ride
in
her
gilt
coach
up
and
down
the
promenade
of
the
valentino
escaping
from
this
ceremonial
with
the
consciousness
that
it
must
be
repeated
on
the
morrow
odo
was
seized
with
that
longing
for
freedom
that
makes
the
first
an
invitation
to
flight
how
he
envied
alfieri
whose
stood
at
the
beck
of
such
moods
odo
scant
means
forbade
evasion
even
had
his
military
duties
not
kept
him
in
turin
he
felt
himself
no
more
than
a
puppet
dancing
to
the
tune
of
parini
satire
a
puny
doll
condemned
as
the
strings
of
custom
pulled
to
feign
the
gestures
of
immortal
passions
the
night
was
moonless
with
cold
dashes
of
rain
and
though
the
streets
of
turin
were
no
reached
the
windings
of
the
lane
behind
the
corpus
domini
as
odo
alone
under
the
wall
of
the
church
awaited
his
arrival
he
wondered
what
risk
had
constrained
the
reckless
alfieri
to
such
unwonted
caution
italy
was
at
that
time
a
vast
network
of
espionage
and
the
piedmontese
capital
passed
for
one
of
the
cities
in
europe
but
even
on
a
moonless
night
the
law
distinguished
between
the
noble
and
the
obscure
delinquent
whose
fate
it
was
to
pay
the
other
shot
odo
knew
that
he
would
probably
be
followed
and
his
movements
reported
to
the
authorities
but
he
was
almost
equally
certain
that
there
would
be
no
active
interference
in
his
affairs
what
chiefly
puzzled
him
was
alfieri
insistence
that
cantapresto
should
not
be
privy
to
the
adventure
the
soprano
had
long
been
the
confidant
of
his
escapades
and
his
adroitness
had
often
been
of
service
in
intrigues
such
as
that
on
which
odo
now
fancied
himself
engaged
the
place
again
perplexed
him
a
sober
quarter
of
convents
and
private
dwellings
in
the
very
eye
of
the
royal
palace
scarce
seeming
the
theatre
for
a
light
adventure
these
incongruities
revived
his
former
wonder
nor
was
this
dispelled
by
alfieri
approach
the
poet
masked
and
unattended
rejoined
his
friend
without
a
word
and
odo
guessed
in
him
an
eye
and
ear
alert
for
pursuit
guided
by
the
pressure
of
his
arm
odo
was
hurried
round
the
bend
of
the
lane
up
a
transverse
alley
and
across
a
little
square
lost
between
high
shuttered
buildings
alfieri
at
his
first
word
gripped
his
arm
with
a
backward
glance
then
urged
him
on
under
the
denser
blackness
of
an
arched
at
the
end
of
which
an
glimmered
here
a
gate
in
a
wall
confronted
them
it
opened
at
alfieri
tap
and
odo
scented
wet
and
felt
the
gravel
of
a
path
under
foot
the
gate
was
at
once
locked
behind
them
and
they
entered
the
of
a
house
as
dark
as
the
garden
here
a
of
close
aspect
met
them
with
a
lamp
and
preceded
them
upstairs
to
a
bare
landing
hung
with
charts
and
portulani
on
odo
flushed
anticipations
this
antechamber
which
seemed
the
approach
to
some
pedant
cabinet
had
an
effect
undeniably
chilling
but
alfieri
heedless
of
his
surprise
had
cast
off
cloak
and
mask
and
now
led
the
way
into
a
long
room
lined
with
a
knot
of
gentlemen
of
sober
dress
and
manner
gathered
about
a
cabinet
of
fossils
in
the
centre
of
this
apartment
looked
up
at
the
entrance
of
the
two
friends
then
the
group
divided
and
odo
with
a
start
recognised
the
girl
he
had
seen
on
the
road
to
the
superga
she
bowed
gravely
to
the
young
men
my
father
said
she
in
a
clear
voice
without
trace
of
diffidence
has
gone
to
his
study
for
a
book
but
will
be
with
you
in
a
moment
she
wore
a
dress
in
keeping
with
her
manner
its
black
stuff
folds
and
the
lawn
kerchief
crossed
on
her
bosom
giving
height
and
authority
to
her
slight
figure
the
dark
unpowdered
hair
drawn
back
over
a
cushion
made
a
severer
setting
for
her
face
than
the
fluctuating
brim
of
her
and
this
perhaps
added
to
the
sense
of
estrangement
with
which
odo
gazed
at
her
but
she
met
his
look
with
a
smile
and
instantly
the
rosy
girl
flashed
through
her
grave
exterior
here
is
my
father
said
she
and
her
companion
of
the
previous
day
stepped
into
the
room
with
several
folios
under
his
arm
alfieri
turned
to
odo
this
my
dear
odo
said
he
is
my
distinguished
friend
professor
vivaldi
who
has
done
us
the
honour
of
inviting
us
to
his
house
he
took
the
professor
hand
i
have
brought
you
he
continued
the
friend
you
were
kind
enough
to
include
in
your
invitation
the
cavaliere
odo
valsecca
vivaldi
bowed
count
alfieri
friends
said
he
are
always
welcome
to
my
house
though
i
fear
there
is
here
little
to
interest
a
young
gentleman
of
the
cavaliere
valsecca
years
and
odo
detected
a
shade
of
doubt
in
his
glance
the
cavaliere
valsecca
alfieri
smilingly
rejoined
is
above
his
years
in
wit
and
learning
and
i
answer
for
his
interest
as
i
do
for
his
discretion
the
professor
bowed
again
count
alfieri
sir
he
said
has
doubtless
explained
to
you
the
necessity
that
obliges
me
to
be
so
private
in
receiving
my
friends
and
now
perhaps
you
will
join
these
gentlemen
in
examining
some
rare
fossil
fish
newly
sent
me
from
the
monte
bolca
odo
murmured
a
civil
rejoinder
but
the
wonder
into
which
the
sight
of
the
young
girl
had
thrown
him
was
fast
verging
on
stupefaction
what
mystery
was
here
what
necessity
compelled
an
elderly
professor
to
receive
his
scientific
friends
like
a
band
of
political
conspirators
how
above
all
in
the
light
of
the
girl
presence
was
odo
to
interpret
alfieri
extravagant
allusions
to
the
nature
of
their
visit
the
company
having
returned
to
the
cabinet
of
fossils
none
seemed
to
observe
his
disorder
but
the
young
lady
who
was
its
cause
and
seeing
him
stand
apart
she
advanced
with
a
smile
saying
perhaps
you
would
rather
look
at
some
of
my
father
other
curiosities
simple
as
the
words
were
they
failed
to
restore
odo
and
for
a
moment
he
made
no
answer
perhaps
she
partly
guessed
the
cause
of
his
commotion
yet
it
was
not
so
much
her
beauty
that
silenced
him
as
the
spirit
that
seemed
to
inhabit
it
nature
in
general
so
chary
of
her
gifts
so
prone
to
use
one
good
feature
as
the
palliation
of
a
dozen
deficiencies
to
wed
the
eloquent
lip
with
the
ineffectual
eye
had
indeed
compounded
her
of
all
fine
meanings
making
each
grace
the
complement
of
another
and
every
outward
charm
expressive
of
some
inward
quality
here
was
as
little
of
the
miss
as
of
the
flippant
and
vapourish
fine
lady
and
any
suggestion
of
a
less
fair
alternative
vanished
before
such
candid
graces
odo
confusion
had
in
truth
sprung
from
alfieri
ambiguous
hints
and
these
shrivelling
to
nought
in
the
gaze
that
encountered
his
constraint
gave
way
to
a
sense
of
wondering
pleasure
i
should
like
to
see
whatever
you
will
show
me
said
he
as
simply
as
one
child
speaking
to
another
and
she
answered
in
the
same
tone
then
we
glance
at
my
father
collections
before
the
serious
business
of
the
evening
begins
with
these
words
she
began
to
lead
him
about
the
room
pointing
out
and
explaining
the
curiosities
it
contained
it
was
clear
that
like
many
scholars
of
his
day
professor
vivaldi
was
something
of
an
eclectic
in
his
studies
for
while
one
table
held
a
fine
orrery
a
cabinet
of
coins
stood
near
and
the
were
surmounted
by
specimens
of
coral
and
petrified
wood
of
all
these
rarities
his
daughter
had
a
word
to
say
and
though
her
explanations
were
brief
and
without
affectation
of
pedantry
they
put
her
companion
ignorance
to
the
blush
it
must
be
owned
however
that
had
his
learning
been
a
match
for
hers
it
would
have
stood
him
in
poor
stead
at
the
moment
his
faculties
being
lost
in
the
wonder
of
hearing
such
discourse
from
such
lips
to
his
compliments
on
her
erudition
she
returned
with
a
smile
that
what
learning
she
had
was
no
merit
since
she
had
been
bred
in
a
library
to
which
she
suddenly
added
you
are
not
unknown
to
me
cavaliere
but
i
never
thought
to
see
you
here
the
words
renewed
her
hearer
surprise
but
giving
him
no
time
to
reply
she
went
on
in
a
lower
tone
you
are
young
and
the
world
is
fair
before
you
have
you
considered
that
before
risking
yourself
among
us
she
coloured
under
odo
wondering
gaze
and
at
his
random
rejoinder
that
it
was
a
risk
any
man
would
gladly
take
without
considering
she
turned
from
him
with
a
gesture
in
which
he
fancied
a
shade
of
disappointment
by
this
they
had
reached
the
cabinet
of
fossils
about
which
the
interest
of
the
other
guests
still
seemed
to
centre
alfieri
indeed
paced
the
farther
end
of
the
room
with
the
air
of
awaiting
the
despatch
of
some
tedious
business
but
the
others
were
engaged
in
an
animated
discussion
necessitating
frequent
reference
to
the
folios
vivaldi
had
brought
from
his
study
the
latter
turned
to
odo
as
though
to
include
him
in
the
group
i
do
not
know
sir
said
he
whether
you
have
found
leisure
to
study
these
enigmas
of
that
mysterious
sphinx
the
earth
for
though
count
alfieri
has
spoken
to
me
of
your
unusual
acquirements
i
understand
your
tastes
have
hitherto
lain
rather
in
the
direction
of
philosophy
and
letters
and
on
odo
prompt
admission
of
ignorance
he
courteously
continued
the
physical
sciences
seem
indeed
less
likely
to
appeal
to
the
imaginative
and
poetical
faculty
in
man
and
on
the
other
hand
religion
has
appeared
to
prohibit
their
too
close
investigation
yet
i
question
if
any
thoughtful
mind
can
enter
on
the
study
of
these
curious
phenomena
without
feeling
as
it
were
an
affinity
between
such
investigations
and
the
most
abstract
forms
of
thought
for
whether
we
regard
these
figured
stones
as
of
terriginous
origin
either
mere
lusus
naturae
or
mineral
formations
produced
by
a
plastic
virtue
latent
in
the
earth
or
whether
as
in
fact
organic
substances
lapidified
by
the
action
of
water
in
either
case
what
speculations
must
their
origin
excite
leading
us
back
into
that
dark
and
unexplored
period
of
time
when
the
breath
of
creation
was
yet
moving
on
the
face
of
the
waters
odo
had
listened
but
confusedly
to
the
first
words
of
this
discourse
but
his
intellectual
curiosity
was
too
great
not
to
respond
to
such
an
appeal
and
all
his
perplexities
slipped
from
him
in
the
pursuit
of
the
professor
thought
one
of
the
other
guests
seemed
struck
by
his
look
of
attention
my
dear
vivaldi
said
this
gentleman
laying
down
a
fossil
and
fixing
his
gaze
on
odo
while
he
addressed
the
professor
why
use
such
superannuated
formulas
in
introducing
a
neophyte
to
a
study
designed
to
subvert
the
very
foundations
of
the
mosaic
cosmogony
i
take
it
the
cavaliere
is
one
of
us
since
he
is
here
this
evening
why
then
permit
him
to
stray
even
for
a
moment
in
the
labyrinth
of
theological
error
the
professor
deprecating
murmur
was
cut
short
by
an
outburst
from
another
of
the
learned
group
a
spectacled
personage
in
a
doctor
gown
pardon
me
for
suggesting
he
exclaimed
that
the
conditional
terms
in
which
our
host
was
careful
to
present
his
hypotheses
are
better
suited
to
the

assertions
but
if
the
vulcanists
are
to
claim
the
cavaliere
valsecca
may
not
the
diluvials
also
have
a
hearing
how
often
must
it
be
repeated
that
theology
as
well
as
physical
science
is
satisfied
by
the
diluvial

of

whereas
inexorable
logic
compels
the
vulcanists
to

that

the
first
speaker
answered
with
a
gesture
of
disdain
my
dear
doctor
you
occupy
a
chair
in
our
venerated
university
from
that
exalted
cathedra
the
mosaic
theory
of
creation
must
still
be
expounded
but
in
the
security
of
these
surroundings
the
catacombs
of
the
new
faith
why
keep
up
the
forms
of
an
obsolete
creed
as
long
ago
as
pythagoras
man
was
taught
that
all
things
were
in
a
state
of
flux
without
end
as
without
beginning
and
must
we
still
after
more
than
two
thousand
years
pretend
to
regard
the
universe
as
some
gigantic
toy
manufactured
in
six
days
by
a
superhuman
artisan
who
is
presently
to
destroy
it
at
his
pleasure
sir
cried
the
other
flushing
from
red
to
purple
at
this
assault
i
know
not
on
what
ground
you
insinuate
that
my
private
convictions
differ
from
my
public
doctrine
but
here
with
a
firmness
tempered
by
the
most
scrupulous
courtesy
professor
vivaldi
intervened
gentlemen
said
he
the
discussion
in
which
you
are
engaged
interesting
as
it
is
must
i
fear
distract
us
from
the
true
purpose
of
our
meeting
i
am
happy
to
offer
my
house
as
the
asylum
of
all
free
research
but
you
must
remember
that
the
first
object
of
these
reunions
is
not
the
special
study
of
any
one
branch
of
modern
science
but
the
application
of
physical
investigation
to
the
origin
and
destiny
of
man
in
other
words
we
ask
the
study
of
nature
to
lead
us
to
the
knowledge
of
ourselves
and
it
is
because
we
approach
this
great
problem
from
a
point
as
yet
unsanctioned
by
dogmatic
authority
that
i
am
reluctantly
obliged
and
here
he
turned
to
odo
with
a
smile
to
throw
a
veil
of
privacy
over
these
inoffensive
meetings
here
at
last
was
the
key
to
the
enigma
the
gentlemen
assembled
in
professor
vivaldi
rooms
were
met
there
to
discuss
questions
not
safely
aired
in
public
they
were
conspirators
indeed
but
the
liberation
they
planned
was
intellectual
rather
than
political
though
the
acuter
among
them
doubtless
saw
whither
such
innovations
tended
meanwhile
they
were
content
to
linger
in
that
wide
field
of
speculation
which
the
development
of
the
physical
sciences
had
recently
opened
to
philosophic
thought
as
at
the
revival
of
learning
the
thinker
imprisoned
in
mediaeval
dialectics
suddenly
felt
under
his
feet
the
firm
ground
of
classic
argument
so
in
the
eighteenth
century
philosophy
long
suspended
in
the
void
of
metaphysic
touched
earth
again
and
drew
fresh
life
from
the
contact
it
was
clear
that
professor
vivaldi
whose
very
name
had
been
unknown
to
odo
was
an
important
figure
in
the
learned
world
and
one
uniting
the
tact
and
firmness
necessary
to
control
those
dissensions
from
which
philosophy
itself
does
not
preserve
its
disciples
his
words
calmed
the
two
disputants
who
were
preparing
to
do
battle
over
odo
unborn
scientific
creed
and
the
talk
growing
more
general
the
professor
turned
to
his
daughter
saying
my
fulvia
is
the
study
prepared
she
signed
her
assent
and
her
father
led
the
way
to
an
inner
cabinet
where
seats
were
drawn
about
a
table
scattered
with
pamphlets
gazettes
and
dictionaries
and
set
out
with
modest
refreshments
here
began
a
conversation
ranging
from
chemistry
to
taxation
and
from
the
perfectibility
of
man
to
the
secondary
origin
of
the
earth
surface
it
was
evident
to
odo
that
though
the
professor
guests
represented
all
shades
of
opinion
some
being
clearly
loth
to
leave
the
safe
anchorage
of
orthodoxy
while
others
already
braved
the
seas
of
free
enquiry
yet
all
were
at
one
as
to
the
need
of
unhampered
action
and
discussion
odo
dormant
curiosity
woke
with
a
start
at
the
summons
of
fresh
knowledge
here
were
worlds
to
explore
or
rather
the
actual
world
about
him
a
region
then
stranger
and
more
unfamiliar
than
the
lost
atlantis
of
fable
liberty
was
the
word
on
every
lip
and
if
to
some
it
represented
the
right
to
doubt
the
diluvial
origin
of
fossils
to
others
that
of
reforming
the
penal
code
to
a
third
as
to
alfieri
merely
personal
independence
and
relief
from
civil
restrictions
yet
these
fragmentary
conceptions
seemed
to
odo
excited
fancy
to
blend
in
the
vision
of
a
new
light
encircling
the
whole
horizon
of
thought
he
understood
at
last
alfieri
allusion
to
a
face
for
the
sight
of
which
men
were
ready
to
lay
down
their
lives
and
if
as
he
walked
home
before
dawn
those
heavenly
lineaments
were
blent
in
memory
with
features
of
a
mortal
cast
yet
these
were
pure
and
grave
enough
to
stand
for
the
image
of
the
goddess
professor
orazio
vivaldi
after
filling
with
distinction
the
chair
of
philosophy
at
the
university
of
turin
had
lately
resigned
his
office
that
he
might
have
leisure
to
complete
a
work
on
the
origin
of
civilisation
his
house
was
the
of
a
society
calling
itself
of
the
and
ostensibly
devoted
to
the
study
of
the
classical
poets
from
whose
pages
the
members
were
supposed
to
cull
mellifluous
nourishment
but
under
this
guise
the
literati
had
for
some
time
indulged
in
free
discussion
of
religious
and
scientific
questions
the
academy
of
the
comprised
among
its
members
all
the
independent
thinkers
of
turin
doctors
of
law
of
philosophy
and
medicine
chemists
philologists
and
naturalists
with
one
or
two
members
of
the
nobility
who
like
alfieri
felt
or
affected
an
interest
in
the
graver
problems
of
life
and
could
be
trusted
not
to
betray
the
true
character
of
the
association
these
details
odo
learned
the
next
day
from
alfieri
who
went
on
to
say
that
owing
to
the
increased
vigilance
of
the
government
and
to
the
banishment
of
several
distinguished
men
accused
by
the
church
of
heretical
or
seditious
opinions
the
had
of
late
been
obliged
to
hold
their
meetings
secretly
it
being
even
rumoured
that
vivaldi
who
was
their
president
had
resigned
his
professorship
and
withdrawn
behind
the
shelter
of
literary
employment
in
order
to
elude
the
observation
of
the
authorities
men
had
not
yet
forgotten
the
fate
of
the
neapolitan
historian
pietro
giannone
who
for
daring
to
attack
the
censorship
and
the
growth
of
the
temporal
power
had
been
driven
from
naples
to
vienna
from
vienna
back
to
venice
and
at
length
at
the
prompting
of
the
holy
see
lured
across
the
piedmontese
frontier
by
charles
emmanuel
of
savoy
and
imprisoned
for
life
in
the
citadel
of
turin
the
memory
of
his
tragic
history
most
of
all
perhaps
of
his
recantation
and
the
devout
ending
to
which
solitude
and
persecution
had
forced
the
freest
spirit
of
his
day

like
a
warning
on
the
horizon
of
thought
and
constrained
political
speculation
to
hide
itself
behind
the
study
of
fashionable
trifles
alfieri
had
lately
joined
the
association
of
the

the
professor
at
his
suggestion
had
invited
odo
for
whose
discretion
his
friend
declared
himself
ready
to
answer
the
were
in
fact
desirous
of
attracting
young
men
of
rank
who
felt
an
interest
in
scientific
or
economic
problems
for
it
was
hoped
that
in
this
manner
the
new
ideas
might
imperceptibly
permeate
the
class
whose
privileges
and
traditions
presented
the
chief
obstacle
to
reform
in
france
it
was
whispered
and
political
agitators
were
the
honoured
guests
of
the
nobility
who
eagerly
embraced
their
theories
and
applied
them
to
the
remedy
of
social
abuses
only
by
similar
means
could
the
ideals
of
the
piedmontese
reformers
be
realised
and
in
those
early
days
of
universal
illusion
none
appeared
to
suspect
the
danger
of
arming
inexperienced
hands
with
untried
weapons
utopia
was
already
in
sight
and
all
the
world
was
setting
out
for
it
as
for
some
heavenly
picnic
ground
of
vivaldi
himself
alfieri
spoke
with
extravagant
admiration
his
affable
exterior
was
said
to
conceal
the
moral
courage
of
one
of
plutarch
heroes
he
was
a
man
after
the
antique
pattern
ready
to
lay
down
fortune
credit
and
freedom
in
the
defence
of
his
convictions
an
agamemnon
alfieri
exclaimed
who
would
not
hesitate
to
sacrifice
his
daughter
to
obtain
a
favourable
wind
for
his
enterprise
the
metaphor
was
perhaps
scarcely
to
odo
taste
but
at
least
it
gave
him
the
chance
for
which
he
had
waited
and
the
daughter
he
asked
the
lovely
doctoress
said
alfieri
carelessly
oh
she
one
of
your
prodigies
of
female
learning
such
as
our
land
produces
an
incipient
laura
bassi
or
gaetana
agnesi
to
name
the
most
distinguished
of
their
tribe
though
i
believe
that
hitherto
her
father
good
sense
or
her
own
has
kept
her
from
aspiring
to
academic
honours
the
beautiful
fulvia
is
a
good
daughter
and
devotes
herself
i
told
to
helping
vivaldi
in
his
work
a
far
more
becoming
employment
for
one
of
her
age
and
sex
than
defending
latin
theses
before
a
crew
of
ribald
students
in
this
odo
was
of
one
mind
with
him
for
though
italy
was
used
to
the
spectacle
of
the
improvisatrice
and
the
female
doctor
of
philosophy
it
is
doubtful
if
the
character
was
one
in
which
any
admirer
cared
to
see
his
divinity
figure
odo
at
any
rate
felt
a
distinct
satisfaction
in
learning
that
fulvia
vivaldi
had
thus
far
made
no
public
display
of
her
learning
how
much
pleasanter
to
picture
her
as
her
father
aid
perhaps
a
sharer
in
his
dreams
a
vestal
cherishing
the
flame
of
liberty
in
the
secret
sanctuary
of
the
goddess
he
scarce
knew
as
yet
of
what
his
feeling
for
the
girl
was
compounded
the
sentiment
she
had
roused
was
one
for
which
his
experience
had
no
name
an
emotion
in
which
awe
mingled
with
an
almost
boyish
sense
of
fellowship
sex
as
yet
lurking
out
of
sight
as
in
some
hidden
ambush
it
was
perhaps
her
association
with
a
world
so
unfamiliar
and
alluring
that
lent
her
for
the
moment
her
greatest
charm
odo
imagination
had
been
profoundly
stirred
by
what
he
had
heard
and
seen
at
the
meeting
of
the
that
impatience
with
the
vanity
of
his
own
pursuits
and
with
the
injustice
of
existing
conditions
which
hovered
like
a
phantom
at
the
feast
of
life
had
at
last
found
form
and
utterance
parini
satires
and
the
bitter
mockery
of
the
frusta
letteraria
were
but
instruments
of
demolition
but
the
arguments
of
the
professor
friends
had
that
constructive
quality
so
appealing
to
the
urgent
temper
of
youth
was
the
world
in
ruins
then
here
was
a
plan
to
rebuild
it
was
humanity
in
chains
behold
the
angel
on
the
threshold
of
the
prison
odo
too
impatient
to
await
the
next
reunion
of
the
sought
out
and
frequented
those
among
the
members
whose
conversation
had
chiefly
attracted
him
they
were
grave
men
of
studious
and
retiring
habit
leading
the
frugal
life
of
the
italian
a
life
in
dignified
contrast
to
the
wasteful
and
aimless
existence
of
the
nobility
odo
sensitiveness
to
outward
impressions
made
him
peculiarly
alive
to
this
contrast
none
was
more
open
than
he
to
the
seducements
of
luxurious
living
the
polish
of
manners
the
tacit
exclusion
of
all
that
is
ugly
or
distressing
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
fine
living
should
be
but
the
flower
of
fine
feeling
and
that
such
external
graces
when
they
adorned
a
dull
and
vapid
society
were
as
incongruous
as
the
royal
purple
on
a
clown
among
certain
of
his
new
friends
he
found
a
clumsiness
of
manner
somewhat
absurdly
allied
with
an
attempt
at
roman
austerity
but
he
was
enough
to
see
that
the
doctor
or
lawyer
who
tries
to
play
the
cicero
is
after
all
a
more
respectable
figure
than
the
marquess
who
apes
caligula
or
commodus
still
his
lurking
dilettantism
made
him
doubly
alive
to
the
elegance
of
the
palazzo
tournanches
when
he
went
thither
from
a
coarse
meal
in
the
stuffy
of
one
of
his
new
acquaintances
as
he
never
relished
the
discourse
of
the
latter
more
than
after
an
afternoon
in
the
society
of
the
countess
parasites
alfieri
allusions
to
the
learned
ladies
for
whom
italy
was
noted
made
odo
curious
to
meet
the
wives
and
daughters
of
his
new
friends
for
he
knew
it
was
only
in
their
class
that
women
received
something
more
than
the
ordinary
conventual
education
and
he
felt
a
secret
desire
to
compare
fulvia
vivaldi
with
other
young
girls
of
her
kind
learned
ladies
he
met
indeed
for
though
the
of
some
of
the
philosophers
were
content
to
cook
and
darn
for
them
and
perhaps
secretly
burn
a
candle
in
their
behalf
to
saint
thomas
aquinas
or
saint
dominick
refuters
of
heresy
there
were
others
who
aspired
to
all
the
honours
of
scholarship
and
would
order
about
their
in
tuscan
and
scold
their
babies
in
ciceronian
latin
among
these
fair
grammarians
however
he
met
none
that
wore
her
learning
lightly
they
were
forever
tripping
in
the
folds
of
their
doctors
gowns
and
delivering
their
most
trivial
views
ex
cathedra
and
too
often
the
poor
philosophers
their
lords
and
fathers
cowered
under
their
harangues
like
frightened
boys
under
the
tongue
of
a
schoolmaster
it
was
in
fact
only
in
the
household
of
orazio
vivaldi
that
odo
found
the
simplicity
and
grace
of
living
for
which
he
longed
alfieri
had
warned
him
not
to
visit
the
professor
too
often
since
the
latter
being
under
observation
might
be
compromised
by
the
assiduity
of
his
friends
odo
therefore
waited
for
some
days
before
presenting
himself
and
when
he
did
so
it
was
at
the
angelus
when
the
streets
were
crowded
and
a
man
comings
and
goings
the
less
likely
to
be
marked
he
found
vivaldi
reading
with
his
daughter
in
the
long
library
where
the
held
their
meetings
but
fulvia
at
once
withdrew
nor
did
she
show
herself
again
during
odo
visit
it
was
clear
that
proud
of
her
as
vivaldi
was
he
had
no
wish
to
parade
her
attainments
and
that
in
her
daily
life
she
maintained
the
italian
habit
of
seclusion
but
to
odo
she
was
everywhere
present
in
the
quiet
room
with
its
books
and
curiosities
and
the
scent
of
flowers
rising
through
the
shuttered
windows
he
was
sensible
of
an
influence
permeating
even
the
inanimate
objects
about
him
so
that
they
seemed
to
reflect
the
spirit
of
those
who
dwelt
there
no
room
had
given
him
this
sense
of
companionship
since
he
had
spent
his
boyish
holidays
in
the
old
count
apartments
but
it
was
of
another
intangible
world
that
his
present
surroundings
spoke
vivaldi
received
him
kindly
and
asked
him
to
repeat
his
visit
and
odo
returned
as
often
as
he
thought
prudent
the
professor
conversation
engaged
him
deeply
vivaldi
familiarity
with
french
speculative
literature
and
with
its
sources
in
the
experiential
philosophy
of
the
english
school
gave
odo
his
first
clear
conception
of
the
origin
and
tendency
of
the
new
movement
this
coordination
of
scattered
ideas
was
aided
by
his
readings
in
the
encyclopaedia
which
though
placed
on
the
index
in
piedmont
was
to
be
found
behind
the
concealed
panels
of
more
than
one
private
library
from
his
talks
with
alfieri
and
from
the
pages
of
plutarch
he
had
gained
a
certain
insight
into
the
stoical
view
of
reason
as
the
measure
of
conduct
and
of
the
inherent
sufficiency
of
virtue
as
its
own
end
he
now
learned
that
all
about
him
men
were
endeavouring
to
restore
the
human
spirit
to
that
lost
conception
of
its
dignity
and
he
longed
to
join
the
band
of
new
crusaders
who
had
set
out
to
recover
the
tomb
of
truth
from
the
forces
of
superstition
the
distinguishing
mark
of
philosophy
was
its
eagerness
to
convert
its
acquisitions
in
every
branch
of
knowledge
into
instruments
of
practical
beneficence
and
this
quality
appealed
peculiarly
to
odo
who
had
ever
been
moved
by
abstract
theories
only
as
they
explained
or
modified
the
destiny
of
man
vivaldi
pleased
by
his
new
pupil
eagerness
to
learn
took
pains
to
set
before
him
this
aspect
of
the
struggle
you
will
now
see
he
said
after
one
of
their
long
talks
about
the
encyclopaedists
why
we
who
have
at
heart
the
mental
and
social
regeneration
of
our
countrymen
are
so
desirous
of
making
a
concerted
effort
against
the
established
system
it
is
only
by
united
action
that
we
can
prevail
the
bravest
mob
of
independent
fighters
has
little
chance
against
a
handful
of
disciplined
soldiers
and
the
church
is
perfectly
logical
in
seeing
her
chief
danger
in
the
systematised
marshalling
of
scattered
truths
as
long
as
the
attacks
on
her
authority
were
isolated
and
as
it
were
sporadic
she
had
little
to
fear
even
from
the
assaults
of
genius
but
the
most
ordinary
intellect
may
find
a
use
and
become
a
power
in
the
ranks
of
an
organised
opposition
seneca
tells
us
the
slaves
in
ancient
rome
were
at
one
time
so
numerous
that
the
government
prohibited
their
wearing
a
distinctive
dress
lest
they
should
learn
their
strength
and
discover
that
the
city
was
in
their
power
and
the
church
knows
that
when
the
countless
spirits
she
has
enslaved
without
subduing
have
once
learned
their
number
and
efficiency
they
will
hold
her
doctrines
at
their
the
church
again
he
continued
has
proved
her
astuteness
in
making
faith
the
gift
of
grace
and
not
the
result
of
reason
by
so
doing
she
placed
herself
in
a
position
which
was
impregnable
till
the
school
of
newton
substituted
observation
for
intuition
and
his
followers
showed
with
increasing
clearness
the
inability
of
the
human
mind
to
apprehend
anything
outside
the
range
of
experience
the
ultimate
claim
of
the
church
rests
on
the
hypothesis
of
an
intuitive
faculty
in
man
disprove
the
existence
of
this
faculty
and
reason
must
remain
the
supreme
test
of
truth
against
reason
the
fabric
of
theological
doctrine
can
not
long
hold
out
and
the
church
doctrinal
authority
once
shaken
men
will
no
longer
fear
to
test
by
ordinary
rules
the
practical
results
of
her
teaching
we
have
not
joined
the
great
army
of
truth
to
waste
our
time
in
vain
disputations
over
metaphysical
subtleties
our
aim
is
by
freeing
the
mind
of
man
from
superstition
to
relieve
him
from
the
practical
abuses
it
entails
as
it
is
impossible
to
examine
any
fiscal
or
industrial
problem
without
discovering
that
the
chief
obstacle
to
improvement
lies
in
the
church
countless
privileges
and
exemptions
so
in
every
department
of
human
activity
we
find
some
inveterate
wrong
taking
shelter
under
the
claim
of
a
authority
this
claim
demolished
the
stagnant
current
of
human
progress
will
soon
burst
its
barriers
and
set
with
a
mighty
rush
toward
the
wide
ocean
of
truth
and
freedom
that
general
belief
in
the
perfectibility
of
man
which
cheered
the
thinkers
in
their
struggle
for
intellectual
liberty
coloured
with
a
delightful
brightness
this
vision
of
a
renewed
humanity
it
threw
its
beams
on
every
branch
of
research
and
shone
like
an
aureole
round
those
who
laid
down
fortune
and
advancement
to
purchase
the
new
redemption
of
mankind
foremost
among
these
as
odo
now
learned
were
many
of
his
own
countrymen
in
his
talks
with
vivaldi
he
first
explored
the
course
of
italian
thought
and
heard
the
names
of
the
great
jurists
vico
and
gravina
and
of
his
own
contemporaries
filangieri
verri
and
beccaria
vivaldi
lent
him
beccaria
famous
volume
and
several
numbers
of
the
caffe
the
brilliant
gazette
which
verri
and
his
associates
were
then
publishing
in
milan
and
in
which
all
the
questions
of
the
day
theological
economic
and
literary
were
discussed
with
a
freedom
possible
only
under
the
lenient
austrian
rule
ah
vivaldi
cried
milan
is
indeed
the
home
of
the
free
spirit
and
were
i
not
persuaded
that
a
man
first
duty
is
to
improve
the
condition
of
his
own
city
and
state
i
should
long
ago
have
left
this
unhappy
kingdom
indeed
i
sometimes
fancy
i
may
yet
serve
my
own
people
better
by
proclaiming
the
truth
openly
at
a
distance
than
by
whispering
it
in
their
midst
it
was
a
surprise
to
odo
to
learn
that
the
new
ideas
had
already
taken
such
hold
in
italy
and
that
some
of
the
foremost
thinkers
on
scientific
and
economic
subjects
were
among
his
own
countrymen
like
all
italians
of
his
class
he
had
been
taught
to
look
to
france
as
the
source
of
all
culture
intellectual
and
social
and
he
was
amazed
to
find
that
in
jurisprudence
and
in
some
of
the
natural
sciences
italy
led
the
learning
of
europe
once
or
twice
fulvia
showed
herself
for
a
moment
but
her
manner
was
retiring
and
almost
constrained
and
her
father
always
contrived
an
excuse
for
dismissing
her
this
was
the
more
noticeable
as
she
continued
to
appear
at
the
meetings
of
the
where
she
joined
freely
in
the
conversation
and
sometimes
diverted
the
guests
by
playing
on
the
harpsichord
or
by
recitations
from
the
poets
all
with
such
art
and
grace
and
withal
so
much
simplicity
that
it
was
clear
she
was
accustomed
to
the
part
odo
was
thus
driven
to
the
not
unflattering
conclusion
that
she
had
been
instructed
to
avoid
his
company
and
after
the
first
disappointment
he
was
too
honest
to
regret
it
he
was
deeply
drawn
to
the
girl
but
what
part
could
she
play
in
the
life
of
a
man
of
his
rank
the
cadet
of
an
impoverished
house
it
was
unlikely
that
he
would
marry
and
should
he
do
so
custom
forbade
even
the
thought
of
taking
a
wife
outside
of
his
class
had
he
been
admitted
to
free
intercourse
with
fulvia
love
might
have
routed
such
prudent
counsels
but
in
the
society
of
her
father
associates
where
she
moved
as
in
a
halo
of
learning
amid
the
respectful
admiration
of
philosophers
and
jurists
she
seemed
as
inaccessible
as
a
young
minerva
odo
at
first
had
been
careful
not
to
visit
vivaldi
too
often
but
the
professor
conversation
was
so
instructive
and
his
library
so
inviting
that
inclination
got
the
better
of
prudence
and
the
young
man
fell
into
the
habit
of
turning
almost
daily
down
the
lane
behind
the
corpus
domini
vivaldi
too
proud
to
betray
any
concern
for
his
personal
safety
showed
no
sign
of
resenting
the
frequency
of
these
visits
indeed
he
received
odo
with
an
increasing
cordiality
that
to
an
older
observer
might
have
betokened
an
effort
to
hide
his
apprehension
one
afternoon
escaping
later
than
usual
from
the
valentino
odo
had
again
bent
toward
the
quiet
quarter
behind
the
palace
he
was
afoot
with
a
cloak
over
his
laced
coat
and
the
day
being
easter
monday
the
streets
were
filled
with
a
throng
of
amid
whom
it
seemed
easy
enough
for
a
man
to
pass
unnoticed
odo
as
he
crossed
the
piazza
castello
thought
it
had
never
presented
a
gayer
scene
booths
with
awnings
had
been
set
up
under
the
arcades
which
were
thronged
with
idlers
of
all
classes
dashed
across
the
square
or
rolled
in
and
out
of
the
and
the
palazzo
madama
lifting
against
the
sunset
its
columns
and
statues
seemed
rather
some
pictured
fabric
of
claude
or
bibbiena
than
an
actual
building
of
brick
and
marble
the
turn
of
a
corner
carried
him
from
this
spectacle
into
the
solitude
of
a
where
his
own
tread
was
the
only
sound
he
walked
on
carelessly
but
suddenly
he
heard
what
seemed
an
echo
of
his
step
he
stopped
and
faced
about
no
one
was
in
sight
but
a
blind
beggar
crouching
at
the
of
the
corpus
domini
odo
walked
on
listening
and
again
he
heard
the
step
and
again
turned
to
find
himself
alone
he
tried
to
fancy
that
his
ear
had
tricked
him
but
he
knew
too
much
of
the
subtle
methods
of
italian
espionage
not
to
feel
a
secret
uneasiness
his
better
judgment
warned
him
back
but
the
desire
to
spend
a
pleasant
hour
prevailed
he
took
a
turn
through
the
neighbouring
streets
in
the
hope
of
diverting
suspicion
and
ten
minutes
later
was
at
the
professor
gate
it
opened
at
once
and
to
his
amazement
fulvia
stood
before
him
she
had
thrown
a
black
mantle
over
her
head
and
her
face
looked
pale
and
vivid
in
the
fading
light
surprise
for
a
moment
silenced
odo
and
before
he
could
speak
the
girl
without
pausing
to
close
the
gate
had
drawn
him
toward
her
and
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
in
the
first
disorder
of
his
senses
he
was
conscious
only
of
seeking
her
lips
but
an
instant
later
he
knew
it
was
no
kiss
of
love
that
met
his
own
and
he
felt
her
tremble
violently
in
his
arms
he
saw
in
a
flash
that
he
was
on
unknown
ground
but
his
one
thought
was
that
fulvia
was
in
trouble
and
looked
to
him
for
aid
he
gently
freed
himself
from
her
hold
and
tried
to
shape
a
soothing
question
but
she
caught
his
arm
and
laying
a
hand
over
his
mouth
drew
him
across
the
garden
and
into
the
house
the
lower
floor
stood
dark
and
empty
he
followed
fulvia
up
the
stairs
and
into
the
library
which
was
also
empty
the
shutters
stood
wide
admitting
the
evening
freshness
and
a
drowsy
scent
of
jasmine
from
the
garden
odo
could
not
control
a
thrill
of
strange
anticipation
as
he
found
himself
alone
in
this
silent
room
with
the
girl
whose
heart
had
so
lately
beat
against
his
own
she
had
sunk
into
a
chair
with
her
face
hidden
and
for
a
moment
or
two
he
stood
before
her
without
speaking
then
he
knelt
at
her
side
and
took
her
hands
with
a
murmur
of
endearment
at
his
touch
she
started
up
and
it
was
i
she
cried
who
persuaded
my
father
that
he
might
trust
you
and
she
sank
back
sobbing
odo
rose
and
moved
away
waiting
for
her
overwrought
emotion
to
subside
at
length
he
gently
asked
do
you
wish
me
to
leave
you
she
raised
her
head
no
she
said
firmly
though
her
lip
still
trembled
you
must
first
hear
an
explanation
of
my
conduct
though
it
is
scarce
possible
she
added
flushing
to
the
brow
that
you
have
not
already
guessed
the
purpose
of
this
lamentable
comedy
i
guess
nothing
he
replied
save
that
perhaps
i
may
in
some
way
serve
you
serve
me
she
cried
with
a
flash
of
anger
through
her
tears
it
is
a
late
hour
to
speak
of
service
after
what
you
have
brought
on
this
house
odo
turned
pale
here
indeed
madam
said
he
are
words
that
need
an
explanation
oh
she
broke
forth
and
you
shall
have
it
though
i
think
to
any
other
it
must
be
writ
large
upon
my
countenance
she
rose
and
paced
the
floor
impetuously
is
it
possible
she
began
again
you
do
not
yet
perceive
the
sense
of
that
execrable
scene
or
do
you
think
by
feigning
ignorance
to
prolong
my
humiliation
oh
she
said
pausing
before
him
her
breast
in
a
tumult
her
eyes
alight
it
was
i
who
persuaded
my
father
of
your
discretion
and
prudence
it
was
through
my
influence
that
he
opened
himself
to
you
so
freely
and
is
this
the
return
you
make
alas
why
did
you
leave
your
fashionable
friends
and
a
world
in
which
you
are
so
fitted
to
shine
to
bring
unhappiness
on
an
obscure
household
that
never
dreamed
of
courting
your
notice
as
she
stood
before
him
in
her
radiant
anger
it
went
hard
with
odo
not
to
silence
with
a
kiss
a
resentment
that
he
guessed
to
be
mainly
directed
against
herself
but
he
controlled
himself
and
said
quietly
madam
i
were
a
dolt
not
to
perceive
that
i
have
had
the
misfortune
to
offend
but
when
or
how
i
swear
to
heaven
i
know
not
and
till
you
enlighten
me
i
can
neither
excuse
nor
defend
myself
she
turned
pale
but
instantly
recovered
her
composure
you
are
right
she
said
i
rave
like
a
foolish
girl
but
indeed
i
scarce
know
if
i
am
in
my
waking
senses
she
paused
as
if
to
check
a
fresh
rush
of
emotion
oh
sir
she
cried
can
you
not
guess
what
has
happened
you
were
warned
i
believe
not
to
frequent
this
house
too
openly
but
of
late
you
have
been
an
almost
daily
visitor
and
you
never
come
here
but
you
are
followed
my
father
doctrines
have
long
been
under
suspicion
and
to
be
accused
of
perverting
a
man
of
your
rank
must
be
his
ruin
he
was
too
proud
to
tell
you
this
and
profiting
today
by
his
absence
and
knowing
that
if
you
came
the
spies
would
be
at
your
heels
i
resolved
to
meet
you
at
the
gate
and
welcome
you
in
such
a
way
that
our
enemies
should
be
deceived
as
to
the
true
cause
of
your
visits
her
voice
wavered
on
the
last
words
but
she
faced
him
proudly
and
it
was
odo
whose
gaze
fell
never
perhaps
had
he
been
conscious
of
cutting
a
meaner
figure
yet
shame
was
so
blent
in
him
with
admiration
for
the
girl
nobility
and
courage
that
compunction
was
swept
away
in
the
impulse
that
flung
him
at
her
feet
ah
he
cried
i
have
been
blind
indeed
and
what
you
say
abases
me
to
earth
yes
i
was
warned
that
my
visits
might
compromise
your
father
nor
had
i
any
pretext
for
returning
so
often
but
my
own
selfish
pleasure
in
his
discourse
or
so
at
least
he
added
in
a
lower
voice
i
chose
to
fancy
but
when
we
met
just
now
at
the
gate
if
you
acted
a
comedy
believe
me
i
did
not
and
if
i
have
come
day
after
day
to
this
house
it
is
because
unknowingly
i
came
for
you
the
words
had
escaped
him
unawares
and
he
was
too
sensible
of
their
untimeliness
not
to
be
prepared
for
the
gesture
with
which
she
cut
him
short
oh
said
she
in
a
tone
of
the
liveliest
reproach
spare
me
this
last
affront
if
you
wish
me
to
think
the
harm
you
have
already
done
was
done
unknowingly
odo
rose
to
his
feet
tingling
under
the
rebuke
if
respect
and
admiration
be
an
affront
madam
he
said
i
can
not
remain
in
your
presence
without
offending
and
nothing
is
left
me
but
to
withdraw
but
before
going
i
would
at
least
ask
if
there
is
no
way
of
repairing
the
harm
that
my
has
caused
she
flushed
high
at
the
question
why
that
she
said
is
in
part
i
trust
already
accomplished
indeed
she
went
on
with
an
effort
it
was
when
i
learned
the
authorities
suspected
you
of
coming
here
on
a
gallant
adventure
that
i
devised
the
idea
of
meeting
you
at
the
gate
and
for
the
rest
sir
the
best
reparation
you
can
make
is
one
that
will
naturally
suggest
itself
to
a
gentleman
whose
time
must
already
be
so
fully
engaged
and
with
that
she
made
him
a
deep
reverence
and
withdrew
to
the
inner
room
when
the
professor
gate
closed
on
odo
night
was
already
falling
and
the
at
the
end
of
the
arched
shed
its
weak
circle
of
light
on
the
pavement
this
light
as
odo
emerged
fell
on
a
retreating
figure
which
resembled
that
of
the
blind
beggar
he
had
seen
crouching
on
the
steps
of
the
corpus
domini
he
ran
forward
but
the
man
hurried
across
the
little
square
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
odo
had
not
seen
his
face
but
though
his
dress
was
tattered
and
he
leaned
on
a
beggar
staff
something
about
his
broad
rolling
back
recalled
the
outline
of
cantapresto
cassock
sick
at
heart
odo
rambled
on
from
one
street
to
another
avoiding
the
more
crowded
quarters
and
losing
himself
more
than
once
in
the
districts
near
the
river
where
young
gentlemen
of
his
figure
seldom
showed
themselves
unattended
the
populace
however
was
all
abroad
and
he
passed
as
unregarded
as
though
his
sombre
thoughts
had
enveloped
him
in
actual
darkness
it
was
late
when
at
length
he
turned
again
into
the
piazza
castello
which
was
brightly
lit
and
still
thronged
with
as
he
approached
the
crowd
divided
to
make
way
for
three
or
four
handsome
preceded
by
linkmen
and
liveried
and
followed
by
a
dozen
mounted
equerries
the
people
evidently
in
the
humour
to
greet
every
incident
of
the
streets
as
part
of
a
show
prepared
for
their
diversion
cheered
lustily
as
the
carriages
dashed
across
the
square
and
odo
turning
to
a
man
at
his
elbow
asked
who
the
distinguished
visitors
might
be
why
sir
said
the
other
laughing
i
understand
it
is
only
an
embassage
from
some
neighbouring
state
but
when
our
good
people
are
in
their
easter
mood
they
are
ready
to
take
a
for
chariot
and
their
wives
scolding
for
the
gift
of
tongues
odo
spent
a
restless
night
face
to
face
with
his
first
humiliation
though
the
girl
rebuff
had
cut
him
to
the
quick
it
was
the
vision
of
the
havoc
his
folly
had
wrought
that
stood
between
him
and
sleep
to
have
endangered
the
liberty
the
very
life
perhaps
of
a
man
he
loved
and
venerated
and
who
had
welcomed
him
without
heed
of
personal
risk
this
indeed
was
bitter
to
his
youthful
the
thought
of
giannone
fate
was
like
a
cold
clutch
at
his
heart
nor
was
there
any
balm
in
knowing
that
it
was
at
fulvia
request
he
had
been
so
freely
welcomed
for
he
was
persuaded
that
whatever
her
previous
feeling
might
have
been
the
scene
just
enacted
must
render
him
forever
odious
to
her
turn
whither
it
would
his
tossing
vanity
found
no
repose
and
dawn
rose
for
him
on
a
thorny
waste
of
disillusionment
cantapresto
broke
in
early
on
this
vigil
flushed
with
the
importance
of
a
letter
from
the
countess
valdu
the
lady
summoned
her
son
to
dinner
to
meet
an
old
friend
and
distinguished
visitor
and
a
verbal
message
bade
odo
come
early
and
wear
his
new
uniform
he
was
too
well
acquainted
with
his
mother
exaggerations
to
attach
much
importance
to
the
summons
but
being
glad
of
an
excuse
to
escape
his
daily
visit
at
the
palazzo
tournanches
he
sent
donna
laura
word
that
he
would
wait
on
her
at
two
on
the
very
threshold
of
casa
valdu
odo
perceived
that
unwonted
preparations
were
afoot
the
shabby
liveries
of
the
servants
had
been
refurbished
and
the
marble
floor
newly
scoured
and
he
found
his
mother
seated
in
the
an
apartment
never
unshrouded
save
on
the
most
ceremonious
occasions
as
to
donna
laura
she
had
undergone
the
same
process
of
renovation
and
with
more
striking
results
it
seemed
to
odo
when
she
met
him
sparkling
under
her
rouge
and
powder
as
though
some
withered
flower
had
been
dipped
in
water
regaining
for
the
moment
a
languid
semblance
of
its
freshness
her
eyes
shone
her
hand
trembled
under
his
lips
and
the
diamonds
rose
and
fell
on
her
eager
bosom
you
are
late
she
tenderly
reproached
him
and
before
he
had
time
to
reply
the
double
doors
were
thrown
open
and
the
announced
in
an
awed
voice
his
excellency
count
lelio
trescorre
odo
turned
with
a
start
to
his
mind
already
crowded
with
a
confusion
of
thoughts
the
name
summoned
a
throng
of
memories
he
saw
again
his
mother
apartments
at
pianura
and
the
handsome
youth
with
lace
ruffles
and
a
clouded
amber
cane
who
came
and
went
among
her
other
visitors
with
an
air
of
such
superiority
and
who
rode
beside
the
on
the
first
stage
of
their
journey
to
donnaz
to
that
handsome
youth
the
gentleman
just
announced
bore
the
likeness
of
the
finished
portrait
to
the
sketch
he
was
a
man
of
about
of
the
middle
height
with
a
delicate
dark
face
and
an
air
of
arrogance
not
unbecomingly
allied
to
an
insinuating
courtesy
of
address
his
dress
of
sombre
velvet
with
a
star
on
the
breast
and
a
profusion
of
the
finest
lace
suggested
the
desire
to
add
dignity
and
weight
to
his
appearance
without
renouncing
the
softer
ambitions
of
his
age
he
received
with
a
smile
donna
laura
agitated
phrases
of
welcome
i
come
said
he
kissing
her
hand
in
my
private
character
not
as
the
envoy
of
pianura
but
as
the
friend
and
servant
of
the
countess
valdu
and
i
trust
he
added
turning
to
odo
of
the
cavaliere
valsecca
also
odo
bowed
in
silence
you
may
have
heard
trescorre
continued
addressing
him
in
the
same
engaging
tone
that
i
am
come
to
turin
on
a
mission
from
his
highness
to
the
court
of
savoy
a
trifling
matter
of
and
customs
which
i
undertook
at
the
duke
desire
the
more
readily
it
must
be
owned
since
it
gave
me
the
opportunity
to
renew
my
acquaintance
with
friends
whom
absence
has
not
taught
me
to
forget
he
smiled
again
at
donna
laura
who
blushed
like
a
girl
the
curiosity
which
trescorre
words
excited
was
lost
to
odo
in
the
painful
impression
produced
by
his
mother
agitation
to
see
her
a
woman
already
past
her
youth
and
aged
by
her
very
efforts
to
preserve
it
trembling
and
bridling
under
the
cool
eye
of
masculine
indifference
was
a
spectacle
the
more
humiliating
that
he
was
too
young
to
be
moved
by
its
human
and
pathetic
side
he
recalled
once
seeing
a
memento
mori
of
ivory
which
represented
a
girl
head
one
side
all
dewy
freshness
the
other
touched
with
death
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
mother
face
resembled
this
tragic
toy
the
side
her
mirror
reflected
being
still
rosy
with
youth
while
that
which
others
saw
was
already
a
ruin
his
heart
burned
with
disgust
as
he
followed
donna
laura
and
trescorre
into
the
which
had
been
set
out
with
all
the
family
plate
and
decked
with
rare
fruits
and
flowers
the
countess
had
excused
her
husband
on
the
plea
of
his
official
duties
and
the
three
sat
down
alone
to
a
meal
composed
of
the
costliest
delicacies
their
guest
who
ate
little
and
drank
less
entertained
them
with
the
latest
news
of
pianura
touching
discreetly
on
the
growing
estrangement
between
the
duke
and
duchess
and
speaking
with
becoming
gravity
of
the
heir
weak
health
it
was
clear
that
the
speaker
without
filling
an
official
position
at
the
court
was
already
deep
in
the
duke
counsels
and
perhaps
also
in
the
duchess
and
odo
guessed
under
his
smiling
indiscretions
the
cool
aim
of
the
man
who
never
wastes
a
shot
toward
the
close
of
the
meal
when
the
servants
had
withdrawn
he
turned
to
odo
with
a
graver
manner
you
have
perhaps
guessed
cavaliere
he
said
that
in
venturing
to
claim
the
countess
hospitality
in
so
private
a
manner
i
had
in
mind
the
wish
to
open
myself
to
you
more
freely
than
would
be
possible
at
court
he
paused
a
moment
as
though
to
emphasise
his
words
and
odo
fancied
he
cultivated
the
trick
of
deliberate
speaking
to
counteract
his
natural
arrogance
of
manner
the
time
has
come
he
went
on
when
it
seems
desirable
that
you
should
be
more
familiar
with
the
state
of
affairs
at
pianura
for
some
years
it
seemed
likely
that
the
duchess
would
give
his
highness
another
son
but
circumstances
now
appear
to
preclude
that
hope
and
it
is
the
general
opinion
of
the
court
physicians
that
the
young
prince
has
not
many
years
to
live
he
paused
again
fixing
his
eyes
on
odo
flushed
face
the
duke
he
continued
has
shown
a
natural
reluctance
to
face
a
situation
so
painful
both
to
his
heart
and
his
ambitions
but
his
feelings
as
a
parent
have
yielded
to
his
duty
as
a
sovereign
and
he
recognises
the
fact
that
you
should
have
an
early
opportunity
of
acquainting
yourself
more
nearly
with
the
affairs
of
the
duchy
and
also
of
seeing
something
of
the
other
courts
of
italy
i
am
persuaded
he
added
that
young
as
you
are
i
need
not
point
out
to
you
on
what
slight
contingencies
all
human
fortunes
hang
and
how
completely
the
heir
recovery
or
the
birth
of
another
prince
must
change
the
aspect
of
your
future
you
have
i
am
sure
the
heart
to
face
such
chances
with
becoming
equanimity
and
to
carry
the
weight
of
conditional
honours
without
any
undue
faith
in
their
permanence
the
admonition
was
so
lightly
uttered
that
it
seemed
rather
a
tribute
to
odo
good
sense
than
a
warning
to
his
inexperience
and
indeed
it
was
difficult
for
him
in
spite
of
an
instinctive
aversion
to
the
man
to
quarrel
with
anything
in
his
address
or
language
trescorre
in
fact
possessed
the
art
of
putting
younger
men
at
their
ease
while
appearing
as
an
equal
among
his
elders
a
gift
doubtless
developed
by
the
circumstances
of
court
life
and
the
need
of
at
once
commanding
respect
and
disarming
diffidence
he
took
leave
upon
his
last
words
declaring
in
reply
to
the
protests
that
he
had
promised
to
accompany
the
court
that
afternoon
to
stupinigi
but
i
hope
he
added
turning
to
odo
to
continue
our
talk
at
greater
length
if
you
will
favour
me
with
a
visit
tomorrow
at
my
lodgings
no
sooner
was
the
door
closed
on
her
illustrious
visitor
than
donna
laura
flung
herself
on
odo
bosom
i
always
knew
it
she
cried
my
dearest
but
oh
that
i
should
live
to
see
the
day
and
she
wept
and
clung
to
him
with
a
thousand
endearments
from
the
nature
of
which
he
gathered
that
she
already
beheld
him
on
the
throne
of
pianura
to
his
laughing
reminder
of
the
distance
that
still
separated
him
from
that
dizzy
eminence
she
made
answer
that
there
was
far
more
than
he
knew
that
the
duke
had
fallen
into
all
manner
of
excesses
which
had
already
gravely
impaired
his
health
and
that
for
her
part
she
only
hoped
her
son
when
raised
to
a
station
so
far
above
her
own
would
not
forget
the
tenderness
with
which
she
had
ever
cherished
him
or
the
fact
that
count
valdu
financial
situation
was
one
quite
unworthy
the
stepfather
of
a
reigning
prince
escaping
at
length
from
this
parody
of
his
own
sensations
odo
found
himself
in
a
tumult
of
mind
that
solitude
served
only
to
increase
events
had
so
pressed
upon
him
within
the
last
few
days
that
at
times
he
was
reduced
to
a
passive
sense
of
spectatorship
an
inability
to
regard
himself
as
the
centre
of
so
many
converging
purposes
it
was
clear
that
trescorre
mission
was
mainly
a
pretext
for
seeing
the
duke
young
kinsman
and
that
some
special
motive
must
have
impelled
the
duke
to
show
such
sudden
concern
for
his
cousin
welfare
trescorre
need
hardly
have
cautioned
odo
against
fixing
his
hopes
on
the
succession
the
duke
himself
was
a
man
not
above
and
more
than
one
chance
stood
between
odo
and
the
duchy
nor
was
it
this
contingency
that
set
his
pulses
beating
but
rather
the
promise
of
an
immediate
change
in
his
condition
the
duke
wished
him
to
travel
to
visit
the
different
courts
of
italy
what
was
the
prospect
of
ruling
over
a
stagnant
principality
to
this
near
vision
of
the
world
and
the
glories
thereof
suddenly
discovered
from
the
golden
height
of
opportunity
save
for
a
few
weeks
of
autumn
villeggiatura
at
some
neighbouring
chase
or
vineyard
odo
had
not
left
turin
for
nine
years
he
had
come
there
a
child
and
had
grown
to
manhood
among
the
same
narrow
influences
and
surroundings
to
be
turned
loose
on
the
world
at
with
such
an
arrears
of
experience
to
his
credit
was
to
enter
on
a
richer
inheritance
than
any
duchy
and
in
odo
case
the
joy
of
the
adventure
was
doubled
by
its
timeliness
that
fate
should
thus
break
at
a
stroke
the
meshes
of
habit
should
stoop
to
play
the
advocate
of
his
secret
inclinations
seemed
to
promise
him
the
complicity
of
the
gods
once
in
a
lifetime
chance
will
thus
snap
the
toils
of
a
man
making
and
it
is
instructive
to
see
the
poor
puppet
adore
the
power
that
connives
at
his
evasion
trescorre
remained
a
week
in
turin
and
odo
saw
him
daily
at
court
at
his
lodgings
or
in
company
the
little
sovereignty
of
pianura
being
an
important
factor
in
the
game
of
political
equilibrium
her
envoy
was
sure
of
a
flattering
reception
from
the
neighbouring
powers
and
trescorre
person
and
address
must
have
commended
him
to
the
most
fastidious
company
he
continued
to
pay
particular
attention
to
odo
and
the
rumour
was
soon
abroad
that
the
cavaliere
valsecca
had
been
sent
for
to
visit
his
cousin
the
reigning
duke
a
rumour
which
combined
with
donna
laura
confidential
hints
made
odo
the
centre
of
much
feminine
solicitude
and
roused
the
countess
clarice
to
a
vivid
sense
of
her
rights
these
circumstances
and
his
own
tendency
to
drift
on
the
current
of
sensation
had
carried
odo
more
easily
than
he
could
have
hoped
past
the
painful
episode
of
the
professor
garden
he
was
still
tormented
by
the
sense
of
his
inability
to
right
so
grave
a
wrong
but
he
found
solace
in
the
thought
that
his
absence
was
after
all
the
best
reparation
he
could
make
trescorre
though
distinguishing
odo
by
his
favours
had
not
again
referred
to
the
subject
of
their
former
conversation
but
on
the
last
day
of
his
visit
he
sent
for
odo
to
his
lodgings
and
at
once
entered
upon
the
subject
his
highness
said
he
does
not
for
the
present
recommend
your
resigning
your
commission
in
the
sardinian
army
but
as
he
desires
you
to
visit
him
at
pianura
and
to
see
something
of
the
neighbouring
courts
he
has
charged
me
to
obtain
for
you
a
two
years
leave
of
absence
from
his
majesty
service
a
favour
the
king
has
already
been
pleased
to
accord
the
duke
has
moreover
resolved
to
double
your
present
allowance
and
has
entrusted
me
with
the
sum
of
two
hundred
ducats
which
he
desires
you
to
spend
in
the
purchase
of
a
and
such
other
appointments
as
are
suitable
to
a
gentleman
of
your
rank
and
expectations
as
he
spoke
he
unlocked
his
and
handed
a
purse
to
odo
his
highness
he
continued
is
impatient
to
see
you
and
once
your
preparations
are
completed
i
should
advise
you
to
set
out
without
delay
that
is
he
added
after
one
of
his
characteristic
pauses
if
i
am
right
in
supposing
that
there
is
no
obstacle
to
your
departure
odo
inferring
an
allusion
to
the
countess
clarice
smiled
and
coloured
slightly
i
know
of
none
he
said
trescorre
bowed
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
he
said
for
i
know
that
a
man
of
your
age
and
appearance
may
have
other
inclinations
than
his
own
to
consider
indeed
i
have
had
reports
of
a
connection
that
i
should
not
take
the
liberty
of
mentioning
were
it
not
that
your
interest
demands
it
he
waited
a
moment
but
odo
remained
silent
i
am
sure
he
went
on
you
will
do
me
the
justice
of
believing
that
i
mean
no
reflection
on
the
lady
when
i
warn
you
against
being
seen
too
often
in
the
quarter
behind
the
corpus
domini
such
attachments
though
engaging
at
the
outset
to
a
fastidious
taste
are
often
more
troublesome
than
a
young
man
of
your
age
can
foresee
and
in
this
case
the
situation
is
complicated
by
the
fact
that
the
girl
father
is
in
ill
odour
with
the
authorities
so
that
should
the
motive
of
your
visits
be
mistaken
you
might
find
yourself
inconveniently
involved
in
the
proceedings
of
the
holy
office
odo
who
had
turned
pale
controlled
himself
sufficiently
to
listen
in
silence
and
with
as
much
pretence
of
indifference
as
he
could
assume
it
was
the
peculiar
misery
of
his
situation
that
he
could
not
defend
fulvia
without
betraying
her
father
and
that
of
the
two
alternatives
prudence
bade
him
reject
the
one
that
chivalry
would
have
chosen
it
flashed
across
him
however
that
he
might
in
some
degree
repair
the
harm
he
had
done
by
finding
out
what
measures
were
to
be
taken
against
vivaldi
and
to
this
end
he
carelessly
asked
is
it
possible
that
the
professor
has
done
anything
to
give
offence
in
such
quarters
his
assumption
of
carelessness
was
perhaps
overdone
for
face
grew
as
blank
as
a
shuttered
i
have
heard
rumours
of
the
kind
he
rejoined
but
they
would
scarcely
have
attracted
my
notice
had
i
not
learned
of
your
honouring
the
young
lady
with
your
favours
he
glanced
at
odo
with
a
smile
were
i
a
father
he
added
with
a
son
of
your
age
my
first
advice
to
him
would
be
to
form
no
sentimental
ties
but
in
his
own
society
or
in
the
world
of
pleasure
the
only
two
classes
where
the
rules
of
the
game
are
understood
odo
had
appointed
to
leave
turin
some
two
weeks
after
departure
but
the
preparations
for
a
young
gentleman
travels
were
in
those
days
a
momentous
business
and
one
not
to
be
discharged
without
vexatious
postponements
the
must
be
purchased
and
fitted
out
the
selected
and
engraved
with
the
owner
arms
servants
engaged
and
provided
with
liveries
and
the
noble
tourist
own
wardrobe
stocked
with
an
assortment
of
costumes
suited
to
the
vicissitudes
of
travel
and
the
requirements
of
court
life
odo
impatience
to
be
gone
increased
with
every
delay
and
at
length
he
determined
to
go
forward
at
all
adventure
leaving
cantapresto
to
conclude
the
preparations
and
overtake
him
later
it
had
been
agreed
with
trescorre
that
odo
on
his
way
to
pianura
should
visit
his
grandfather
the
old
marquess
whose
increasing
infirmities
had
for
some
years
past
imprisoned
him
on
his
estates
and
accordingly
about
the
ascension
he
set
out
in
the
saddle
for
donnaz
attended
only
by
one
servant
and
having
appointed
that
cantapresto
should
meet
him
with
the
carriage
at
ivrea
the
morning
broke
cloudy
as
he
rode
out
of
the
gates
beyond
the
suburbs
a
few
drops
fell
and
as
he
pressed
forward
the
country
lay
before
him
in
the
emerald
freshness
of
a
spring
rain
vivid
strips
of
vineyard
alternating
with
silvery
bands
of
oats
the
domes
of
the
dripping
above
the
roadside
and
the
poplars
along
the
all
slanting
one
way
in
the
soft
continuous
downpour
he
had
left
turin
in
that
mood
of
clinging
melancholy
which
waits
on
the
most
hopeful
departures
and
the
landscape
seemed
an
image
of
anticipations
clouded
with
regret
he
had
had
a
stormy
but
tender
parting
with
clarice
whose
efforts
to
act
the
forsaken
ariadne
were
somewhat
marred
by
her
irrepressible
pride
in
her
lover
prospects
and
whose
last
word
had
charged
him
to
bring
her
back
one
of
the
rare
bred
by
the
monks
of
bologna
seen
down
the
lengthening
vista
of
separation
even
clarice
seemed
regrettable
and
odo
would
have
been
glad
to
let
his
mind
linger
on
their
farewells
but
another
thought
importuned
him
he
had
left
turin
without
news
of
vivaldi
or
fulvia
and
without
having
done
anything
to
conjure
the
peril
to
which
his
rashness
had
exposed
them
more
than
once
he
had
been
about
to
reveal
his
trouble
to
alfieri
but
shame
restrained
him
when
he
remembered
that
it
was
alfieri
who
had
vouched
for
his
discretion
after
his
conversation
with
trescorre
he
had
tried
to
find
some
way
of
sending
a
word
of
warning
to
vivaldi
but
he
had
no
messenger
whom
he
could
trust
and
would
not
vivaldi
justly
resent
a
warning
from
such
a
source
he
felt
himself
the
prisoner
of
his
own
folly
and
as
he
rode
along
the
wet
country
roads
an
invisible
gaoler
seemed
to
spur
beside
him
the
clouds
lifted
at
noon
and
leaving
the
plain
he
mounted
into
a
world
sparkling
with
sunshine
and
quivering
with
streams
the
first
breath
of
lifted
the
mist
from
his
spirit
and
he
began
to
feel
himself
a
boy
again
as
he
entered
the
high
gorges
in
the
cold
light
after
sunset
it
was
about
the
full
of
the
moon
and
in
his
impatience
to
reach
donnaz
he
resolved
to
push
on
after
nightfall
the
forest
was
still
and
the
rustle
of
wind
in
the
branches
and
the
noise
of
the
torrents
recalled
his
first
approach
to
the
castle
in
the
wild
winter
twilight
the
way
lay
in
darkness
till
the
moon
rose
and
once
or
twice
he
took
a
wrong
turn
and
found
himself
engaged
in
some
overgrown
woodland
track
but
he
soon
regained
the
and
his
servant
a
young
fellow
of
indomitable
cheerfulness
took
the
edge
off
their
solitude
by
frequent
snatches
of
song
at
length
the
moon
rose
and
toward
midnight
odo
spurring
out
of
a
dark
glen
found
himself
at
the
opening
of
the
valley
of
donnaz
a
cold
radiance
bathed
the
familiar
pastures
the
houses
of
the
village
along
the
stream
and
the
turrets
and
crenellations
of
the
castle
at
the
head
of
the
gorge
the
air
was
bitter
and
the
horses
hoofs
struck
sharply
on
the
road
as
they
trotted
past
the
slumbering
houses
and
halted
at
the
gateway
through
which
odo
had
first
been
carried
as
a
sleepy
child
it
was
long
before
the
travellers
knock
was
answered
but
a
bewildered
porter
at
length
admitted
them
and
odo
cried
out
when
he
recognised
in
the
man
face
the
features
of
one
of
the
lads
who
had
taught
him
to
play
pallone
in
the
castle
court
within
doors
all
were
abed
but
the
cavaliere
was
expected
and
supper
laid
for
him
in
the
very
chamber
where
he
had
slept
as
a
lad
the
sight
of
so
much
that
was
strange
and
yet
familiar
of
the
old
stone
walls
the
banners
the
flaring
lamps
and
worn
slippery
stairs
all
so
much
barer
smaller
more
dilapidated
than
he
had
remembered
stirred
the
deep
springs
of
his
piety
for
inanimate
things
and
he
was
seized
with
a
fancy
to
snatch
up
a
light
and
explore
the
recesses
of
the
castle
but
he
had
been
in
the
saddle
since
dawn
and
the
keen
air
and
the
long
hours
of
riding
were
in
his
blood
they
weighted
his
lids
relaxed
his
limbs
and
gently
divesting
him
of
his
hopes
and
fears
pressed
him
down
in
the
deep
sepulchre
of
a
dreamless
sleep
odo
remained
a
month
at
donnaz
his
grandfather
happiness
in
his
presence
would
in
itself
have
sufficed
to
detain
him
apart
from
his
natural
tenderness
for
old
scenes
and
associations
it
was
one
of
the
compensations
of
his
rapidly
travelling
imagination
that
the
past
from
each
new
of
sensation
acquired
a
fascination
which
to
the
more
fancy
only
the
perspective
of
years
can
give
life
in
childhood
is
a
of
which
the
text
is
undecipherable
and
the
youth
now
revisiting
the
unchanged
setting
of
his
boyhood
was
spelling
out
for
the
first
time
the
legend
beneath
the
picture
the
old
marquess
though
broken
in
body
still
ruled
his
household
from
his
seat
beside
the
hearth
the
failure
of
bodily
activity
seemed
to
have
doubled
his
moral
vigour
and
the
walls
shook
with
the
vehemence
of
his
commands
the
marchioness
was
sunk
in
a
state
of
placid
apathy
from
which
only
her
husband
outbursts
roused
her
one
of
the
canonesses
was
dead
and
the
other
drier
and
more
shrivelled
than
ever
pined
in
her
corner
like
a
statue
whose
mate
is
broken
bruno
was
dead
too
his
old
dog
bones
had
long
since
enriched
a
corner
of
the
vineyard
and
some
of
the
younger
lads
that
odo
had
known
about
the
place
were
grown
to
men
with
wives
and
children
don
gervaso
was
still
chaplain
of
donnaz
and
odo
saw
with
surprise
that
the
grave
ecclesiastic
who
had
formerly
seemed
an
old
man
to
him
was
in
fact
scarce
past
the
middle
age
in
general
aspect
he
was
unchanged
but
his
countenance
had
darkened
and
what
odo
had
once
taken
for
harshness
of
manner
he
now
perceived
to
be
a
natural
melancholy
the
young
man
had
not
been
long
at
donnaz
without
discovering
that
in
that
little
world
of
crystallised
traditions
the
chaplain
was
the
only
person
conscious
of
the
new
forces
abroad
it
had
never
occurred
to
the
marquess
that
anything
short
of
a
cataclysm
such
as
it
would
be
blasphemy
to
predict
could
change
the
divinely
established
order
whereby
the
territorial
lord
took
tithes
from
his
peasantry
and
pastured
his
game
on
their
crops
the
hierarchy
which
rested
on
the
bowed
back
of
the
toiling
serf
and
culminated
in
the
figure
of
the
king
seemed
to
him
as
immutable
as
the
everlasting
hills
the
men
of
his
generation
had
not
learned
that
it
was
built
on
a
human
foundation
and
that
a
sudden
movement
of
the
underlying
mass
might
shake
the
structure
to
its
pinnacle
the
marquess
who
like
donna
laura
already
beheld
odo
on
the
throne
of
pianura
was
prodigal
of
counsels
which
showed
a
touching
inability
to
discern
the
new
aspect
under
which
old
difficulties
were
likely
to
present
themselves
that
a
ruler
should
be
brave
prudent
personally
abstemious
and
nobly
lavish
in
his
official
display
that
he
should
repress
any
attempts
on
the
privileges
of
the
church
while
at
the
same
time
protecting
his
authority
from
the
encroachments
of
the
holy
see
these
axioms
seemed
to
the
old
man
to
sum
up
the
duty
to
the
state
the
relation
to
his
mind
remained
a
distinctly
personal
and
paternal
one
and
odo
attempts
to
put
before
him
the
new
theory
of
government
as
a
service
performed
by
the
ruler
in
the
interest
of
the
ruled
resulted
only
in
stirring
up
the
old
sediment
of
absolutism
which
generations
of
feudal
power
had
deposited
in
the
donnaz
blood
only
the
chaplain
perceived
what
new
agencies
were
at
work
but
even
he
looked
on
as
a
watcher
from
a
distant
tower
who
sees
opposing
armies
far
below
him
in
the
night
without
being
able
to
follow
their
movements
or
guess
which
way
the
battle
goes
the
days
he
said
to
odo
are
evil
the
church
enemies
the
basilisks
and
dragons
of
unbelief
and
license
are
stirring
in
their
old
lairs
the
dark
places
of
the
human
spirit
it
is
time
that
a
fresh
purification
by
blood
should
cleanse
the
earth
of
its
sins
that
hour
has
already
come
in
france
where
the
blood
of
heretics
has
lately
fertilised
the
soil
of
faith
it
will
come
here
as
surely
as
i
now
stand
before
you
and
till
it
comes
the
faithful
can
only
weary
heaven
with
their
entreaties
if
haply
thereby
they
may
mitigate
the
evil
i
shall
remain
here
he
continued
while
the
marquess
needs
me
but
that
task
discharged
i
intend
to
retire
to
one
of
the
contemplative
orders
and
with
my
soul
perpetually
uplifted
like
the
arms
of
moses
wear
out
my
life
in
prayer
for
those
whom
the
latter
days
shall
overtake
odo
had
listened
in
silence
but
after
a
moment
he
said
my
father
among
those
who
have
called
in
to
question
the
old
order
of
things
there
are
many
animated
by
no
mere
desire
for
change
no
idle
inclination
to
pry
into
the
divine
mysteries
but
who
earnestly
long
to
ease
the
burden
of
mankind
and
let
light
into
what
you
have
called
the
dark
places
of
the
spirit
how
is
it
they
ask
that
though
christ
came
to
save
the
poor
and
the
humble
it
is
on
them
that
life
presses
most
heavily
after
eighteen
hundred
years
of
his
rule
all
can
not
be
well
in
a
world
where
such
contradictions
exist
and
what
if
some
of
the
worst
abuses
of
the
age
have
found
lodgment
in
the
very
ramparts
that
faith
has
built
against
them
don
gervaso
face
grew
stern
and
his
eyes
rested
sadly
on
odo
you
speak
said
he
of
bringing
light
into
dark
places
but
what
light
is
there
on
earth
save
that
which
is
shed
by
the
cross
and
where
shall
they
find
guidance
who
close
their
eyes
to
that
divine
illumination
but
is
there
not
odo
rejoined
a
divine
illumination
within
each
of
us
the
light
of
truth
which
we
must
follow
at
any
cost
or
have
the
worst
evils
and
abuses
only
to
take
refuge
in
the
church
to
find
sanctuary
there
as
malefactors
find
it
the
chaplain
shook
his
head
it
is
as
i
feared
he
said
and
satan
has
spread
his
subtlest
snare
for
you
for
if
he
tempts
some
in
the
guise
of
sensual
pleasure
or
of
dark
fears
and
spiritual
abandonment
it
is
said
that
to
those
he
most
thirsts
to
destroy
he
appears
in
the
likeness
of
their
saviour
you
tell
me
it
is
to
right
the
wrongs
of
the
poor
and
the
humble
that
your
new
friends
the
philosophers
have
assailed
the
authority
of
christ
i
have
only
one
answer
to
make
christ
as
you
said
just
now
died
for
the
poor
how
many
of
your
philosophers
would
do
as
much
because
men
hunger
and
thirst
is
that
a
sign
that
he
has
forsaken
them
and
since
when
have
earthly
privileges
been
the
token
of
his
favour
may
he
not
rather
have
designed
that
by
continual
sufferings
and
privations
they
shall
lay
up
for
themselves
treasures
in
heaven
such
as
your
eyes
and
mine
shall
never
see
or
our
ears
hear
and
how
dare
you
assume
that
any
temporal
advantages
could
atone
for
that
of
which
your
teachings
must
deprive
them
the
heavenly
consolations
of
the
love
of
christ
odo
listened
with
a
sense
of
deepening
discouragement
but
is
it
necessary
he
urged
to
confound
christ
with
his
ministers
the
law
with
its
exponents
may
not
men
preserve
their
hope
of
heaven
and
yet
lead
more
endurable
lives
on
earth
ah
my
child
beware
for
this
is
the
heresy
of
private
judgment
which
has
already
drawn
down
thousands
into
the
pit
it
is
one
of
the
most
insidious
errors
in
which
the
spirit
of
evil
has
ever
masqueraded
for
it
is
based
on
the
fallacy
that
we
blind
creatures
of
a
day
and
ourselves
in
the
meshes
of
sin
can
penetrate
the
counsels
of
the
eternal
and
test
the
balances
of
the
heavenly
justice
i
tremble
to
think
into
what
an
abyss
your
noblest
impulses
may
fling
you
if
you
abandon
yourself
to
such
illusions
and
more
especially
if
it
pleases
god
to
place
in
your
hands
a
small
measure
of
that
authority
of
which
he
is
the
supreme
when
i
took
leave
of
you
here
nine
years
since
don
gervaso
continued
in
a
gentler
tone
we
prayed
together
in
the
chapel
and
i
ask
you
before
setting
out
on
your
new
life
to
return
there
with
me
and
lay
your
doubts
and
difficulties
before
him
who
alone
is
able
to
still
the
stormy
waves
of
the
soul
odo
touched
by
the
appeal
accompanied
him
to
the
chapel
and
knelt
on
the
steps
whence
his
young
spirit
had
once
soared
upward
on
the
heavenly
pleadings
of
the
mass
the
chapel
was
as
carefully
tended
as
ever
and
amid
the
comely
appointments
of
the
altar
shone
forth
that
presence
which
speaks
to
men
of
an
act
of
love
perpetually
renewed
but
to
odo
the
voice
was
mute
the
divinity
wrapped
in
darkness
and
he
remembered
reading
in
some
latin
author
that
the
ancient
oracles
had
ceased
to
speak
when
their
questioners
lost
faith
in
them
he
knew
not
whether
his
own
faith
was
lost
he
felt
only
that
it
had
put
forth
on
a
sea
of
difficulties
across
which
he
saw
the
light
of
no
divine
command
in
this
mood
there
was
no
more
help
to
be
obtained
from
don
gervaso
than
from
the
marquess
odo
last
days
at
donnaz
were
clouded
by
a
sense
of
the
deep
estrangement
between
himself
and
that
life
of
which
the
outward
aspect
was
so
curiously
unchanged
his
past
seemed
to
look
at
him
with
unrecognising
eyes
to
bar
the
door
against
his
knock
and
he
rode
away
saddened
by
that
sense
of
isolation
which
follows
the
first
encounter
with
a
forgotten
self
at
ivrea
the
sight
of
cantapresto
and
the
roused
him
as
from
a
waking
dream
here
at
his
beck
were
the
genial
realities
of
life
embodied
humorously
enough
in
the
bustling
figure
which
for
so
many
years
had
played
a
kind
of
comic
accompaniment
to
his
experiences
cantapresto
was
in
a
fever
of
expectation
to
set
forth
on
the
road
again
after
nine
years
of
monotony
and
under
conditions
so
favourable
to
his
physical
was
to
drink
the
wine
of
romance
from
a
golden
cup
odo
was
at
the
age
when
the
spirit
lies
as
naturally
open
to
the
variations
of
mood
as
a
lake
to
the
shifting
of
the
breeze
and
cantapresto
exuberant
humour
and
the
novel
details
of
their
travelling
equipment
had
soon
effaced
the
graver
influences
of
donnaz
life
stretched
before
him
alluring
and
various
as
the
open
road
and
his
pulses
danced
to
the
tune
of
the
postillion
whip
as
the
carriage
rattled
out
of
the
gates
it
was
a
bright
morning
and
the
plain
lay
beneath
them
like
a
planted
garden
in
all
the
flourish
and
verdure
of
june
but
the
roads
being
deep
in
mire
and
unrepaired
after
the
ravages
of
the
winter
it
was
past
noon
before
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
hills
here
matters
were
little
better
for
the
highway
was
ploughed
deep
by
the
wheels
of
the
numberless
vans
and
coaches
journeying
from
one
town
to
another
during
the
whitsun
holidays
so
that
even
a
young
gentleman
travelling
post
must
resign
himself
to
a
plebeian
rate
of
progression
odo
at
first
was
too
much
pleased
with
the
novelty
of
the
scene
to
quarrel
with
any
incidental
annoyances
but
as
the
afternoon
wore
on
the
way
began
to
seem
long
and
he
was
just
giving
utterance
to
his
impatience
when
cantapresto
putting
his
head
out
of
the
window
announced
in
a
tone
of
pious
satisfaction
that
just
ahead
of
them
were
a
party
of
travellers
in
far
worse
case
than
themselves
odo
leaning
out
saw
that
a
dozen
yards
ahead
a
modest
chaise
of
antique
pattern
had
in
fact
come
to
grief
by
the
roadside
he
called
to
his
postillion
to
hurry
forward
and
they
were
soon
abreast
of
the
wreck
about
which
several
people
were
grouped
in
anxious
colloquy
odo
sprang
out
to
offer
his
services
but
as
he
alit
he
felt
cantapresto
hand
on
his
sleeve
cavaliere
the
soprano
whispered
these
are
plainly
people
of
no
condition
and
we
have
yet
a
good
seven
miles
to
vercelli
where
all
the
inns
will
be
crowded
for
the
whitsun
fair
believe
me
it
were
better
to
go
forward
odo
advanced
without
heeding
this
admonition
but
a
moment
later
he
had
almost
regretted
his
action
for
in
the
centre
of
the
group
about
the
chaise
stood
the
two
persons
whom
of
all
the
world
he
was
at
that
moment
least
wishful
of
meeting
it
was
in
fact
vivaldi
who
putting
aside
the
knot
of
idlers
about
the
chaise
stepped
forward
at
odo
approach
the
philosopher
countenance
was
perturbed
his
spattered
with
mud
and
his
daughter
hooded
and
veiled
clung
to
him
with
an
air
of
apprehension
that
smote
odo
to
the
heart
he
caught
a
blush
of
recognition
beneath
her
veil
and
as
he
drew
near
she
raised
a
finger
to
her
lip
and
faintly
shook
her
head
the
mute
signal
reassured
him
i
see
sir
said
he
turning
courteously
to
vivaldi
that
you
are
in
a
bad
plight
and
i
hope
that
i
or
my
carriage
may
be
of
service
to
you
he
ventured
a
second
glance
at
fulvia
but
she
had
turned
aside
and
was
inspecting
the
wheel
of
the
chaise
with
an
air
of
the
most
disheartening
detachment
vivaldi
who
had
returned
odo
greeting
without
any
sign
of
bowed
slightly
and
seemed
to
hesitate
a
moment
our
plight
as
you
see
he
said
is
indeed
a
grave
one
for
the
wheel
has
come
off
our
carriage
and
my
driver
here
tells
me
there
is
no
smithy
this
side
vercelli
where
it
is
imperative
we
should
lie
tonight
i
hope
however
he
added
glancing
down
the
road
that
with
all
the
traffic
now
coming
and
going
we
may
soon
be
overtaken
by
some
vehicle
that
will
carry
us
to
our
destination
he
spoke
calmly
but
it
was
plain
some
pressing
fear
underlay
his
composure
and
the
nature
of
the
emergency
was
but
too
clear
to
odo
will
not
my
carriage
serve
you
he
hastily
rejoined
i
am
for
vercelli
and
if
you
will
honour
me
with
your
company
we
can
go
forward
at
once
fulvia
during
this
exchange
of
words
had
affected
to
be
engaged
with
the
luggage
which
lay
in
a
heap
beside
the
chaise
but
at
this
point
she
lifted
her
head
and
shot
a
glance
at
her
father
from
under
her
black
vivaldi
constraint
increased
this
sir
said
he
is
a
handsome
offer
and
one
for
which
i
thank
you
but
i
fear
our
presence
may
incommode
you
and
the
additional
weight
of
our
luggage
perhaps
delay
your
progress
i
have
little
fear
but
some
van
or
waggon
will
overtake
us
before
nightfall
and
should
it
chance
otherwise
he
added
with
a
touch
of
irresistible
pedantry
why
it
behoves
us
to
remember
that
we
shall
be
none
the
worse
off
since
the
sage
is
independent
of
circumstances
odo
could
hardly
repress
a
smile
such
philosophy
sir
is
admirable
in
principle
but
in
practice
hardly
applicable
to
a
lady
unused
to
passing
her
nights
in
a
the
region
about
here
is
notoriously
unhealthy
and
you
will
surely
not
expose
your
daughter
to
the
risk
of
remaining
by
the
roadside
or
of
finding
a
lodging
in
some
hut
vivaldi
drew
himself
up
my
daughter
said
he
has
been
trained
to
face
graver
emergencies
with
an
equanimity
i
have
no
fear
of
putting
to
the
touch
calm
of
a
mind
blest
in
the
consciousness
of
its
virtue
and
were
it
not
that
circumstances
are
somewhat
pressing
he
broke
off
and
glanced
at
cantapresto
who
was
fidgeting
about
carriage
or
talking
in
undertones
with
the
driver
of
the
chaise
come
sir
said
odo
urgently
let
my
servants
put
your
luggage
up
and
we
continue
this
argument
on
the
road
vivaldi
again
paused
sir
he
said
at
length
will
you
first
step
aside
with
me
a
moment
he
led
odo
a
few
paces
down
the
road
i
make
no
pretence
he
went
on
when
they
were
out
of
cantapresto
hearing
of
concealing
from
you
that
this
offer
comes
very
opportune
to
our
needs
for
it
is
urgent
we
should
be
out
of
piedmont
by
tomorrow
but
before
accepting
a
seat
in
your
carriage
i
must
tell
you
that
you
offer
it
to
a
proscribed
man
since
i
have
little
reason
to
doubt
that
by
this
time
the
sbirri
are
on
my
track
it
was
impossible
to
guess
from
vivaldi
manner
whether
he
suspected
odo
of
being
the
cause
of
his
misadventure
and
the
young
man
though
flushing
to
the
forehead
took
refuge
in
the
thought
of
fulvia
signal
and
maintained
a
silence
the
motive
of
my
persecution
vivaldi
continued
i
need
hardly
explain
to
one
acquainted
with
my
house
and
with
the
aims
and
opinions
of
those
who
frequent
it
we
live
alas
in
an
age
when
it
is
a
moral
offence
to
seek
enlightenment
a
political
crime
to
share
it
with
others
i
have
long
foreseen
that
any
attempt
to
raise
the
condition
of
my
countrymen
must
end
in
imprisonment
or
flight
and
though
perhaps
to
have
suffered
the
former
had
been
a
more
impressive
vindication
of
my
views
why
sir
the
father
at
the
last
moment
overruled
the
philosopher
and
thinking
of
my
poor
girl
there
who
but
for
me
stands
alone
in
the
world
i
resolved
to
take
refuge
in
a
state
where
a
man
may
work
for
the
liberty
of
others
without
endangering
his
own
odo
had
listened
with
rising
eagerness
was
not
here
an
opportunity
if
not
to
atone
at
least
to
give
practical
evidence
of
his
contrition
what
you
tell
me
sir
he
exclaimed
can
not
but
increase
my
zeal
to
serve
you
here
is
no
time
to
palter
i
am
on
my
way
to
lombardy
which
from
what
you
say
i
take
to
be
your
destination
also
and
if
you
and
your
daughter
will
give
me
your
company
across
the
border
i
think
you
need
fear
no
farther
annoyance
from
the
police
since
my
passports
as
the
duke
of
pianura
cousin
cover
any
friends
i
choose
to
take
in
my
company
why
sir
said
vivaldi
visibly
moved
by
the
readiness
of
the
response
here
is
a
generosity
so
far
in
excess
of
our
present
needs
that
it
encourages
me
to
accept
the
smaller
favour
of
travelling
with
you
to
vercelli
there
we
have
friends
with
whom
we
shall
be
safe
for
the
night
and
soon
after
sunrise
i
hope
we
may
be
across
the
border
odo
at
once
followed
up
his
advantage
by
pointing
out
that
it
was
on
the
border
that
difficulties
were
most
likely
to
arise
but
after
a
few
moments
of
debate
vivaldi
declared
he
must
first
take
counsel
with
his
daughter
who
still
hung
like
a
mute
interrogation
on
the
outskirts
of
their
talk
after
a
few
words
with
her
he
returned
to
odo
my
daughter
said
he
whose
good
sense
puts
my
wisdom
to
the
blush
wishes
me
first
to
enquire
if
you
purpose
returning
to
turin
since
in
that
case
as
she
points
out
your
kindness
might
result
in
annoyances
to
which
we
have
no
right
to
expose
you
odo
coloured
such
considerations
i
beg
your
daughter
to
believe
would
not
weigh
with
me
an
instant
but
as
i
am
leaving
piedmont
for
two
years
i
am
not
so
happy
as
to
risk
anything
by
serving
you
vivaldi
on
this
assurance
at
once
consented
to
accept
a
seat
in
his
carriage
as
far
as
boffalora
the
first
village
beyond
the
sardinian
frontier
it
was
agreed
that
at
vercelli
odo
was
to
set
down
his
companions
at
an
inn
whence
alone
and
privately
they
might
gain
their
friend
house
that
on
the
morrow
at
daybreak
he
was
to
take
them
up
at
a
point
near
the
convent
of
the
umiliati
and
that
thence
they
were
to
push
forward
without
a
halt
for
boffalora
this
agreement
reached
odo
was
about
to
offer
fulvia
a
hand
to
the
carriage
when
an
unwelcome
thought
arrested
him
i
hope
sir
said
he
again
turning
to
vivaldi
and
blushing
furiously
as
he
spoke
that
you
feel
assured
of
my
discretion
but
i
ought
perhaps
to
warn
you
that
my
companion
yonder
though
the
fellow
alive
is
not
one
to
live
long
on
good
terms
with
a
secret
whether
his
own
or
another
i
am
obliged
to
you
said
vivaldi
for
the
hint
but
my
daughter
and
i
are
like
those
messengers
who
in
time
of
war
learn
to
carry
their
despatches
beneath
their
tongues
you
may
trust
us
not
to
betray
ourselves
and
your
friend
may
if
he
chooses
suppose
me
to
be
travelling
to
milan
to
act
as
governor
to
a
young
gentleman
of
quality
the
professor
luggage
had
by
this
been
put
on
odo
carriage
and
the
latter
advanced
to
fulvia
he
had
drawn
a
favourable
inference
from
the
concern
she
had
shown
for
his
welfare
but
to
his
mortification
she
merely
laid
two
reluctant
finger
tips
in
his
hand
and
took
her
seat
without
a
word
of
thanks
or
so
much
as
a
glance
at
her
rescuer
this
unmerited
repulse
and
the
constraint
occasioned
by
presence
made
the
remainder
of
the
drive
interminable
even
the
professor
apposite
reflections
on
and
the
culture
of
the
mulberry
did
little
to
shorten
the
way
and
when
at
length
the
of
vercelli
rose
in
sight
odo
felt
the
relief
of
a
man
who
has
acquitted
himself
of
a
tedious
duty
he
had
looked
forward
with
the
most
romantic
anticipations
to
the
outcome
of
this
chance
encounter
with
fulvia
but
the
unforgiving
humour
which
had
lent
her
a
transitory
charm
now
became
as
disfiguring
as
some
physical
defect
and
his
heart
swelled
with
the
defiance
of
youthful
disappointment
it
was
near
the
angelus
when
they
entered
the
city
just
within
the
gates
odo
set
down
his
companions
who
took
leave
of
him
the
one
with
the
heartiest
expressions
of
gratitude
the
other
with
a
hurried
inclination
of
her
veiled
head
thence
he
drove
on
to
the
three
crowns
where
he
designed
to
lie
the
streets
were
still
crowded
with
and
decked
out
with
festal
hangings
tapestries
and
silken
draperies
adorned
the
balconies
of
the
houses
innumerable
tiny
lamps
framed
the
doors
and
windows
and
the
were
dressed
with
a
profusion
of
flowers
while
every
square
and
open
space
in
the
city
was
crowded
with
booths
with
the
tents
of
ambulant
comedians
and
dentists
and
with
the
outspread
carpets
of
and
jugglers
among
this
mob
of
quacks
and
pedlars
circulated
other
fantastic
figures
the
of
the
army
of
hucksters
dwarfs
and
cripples
mendicant
friars
gypsy
and
the
itinerant
reciters
of
ariosto
and
tasso
with
these
mingled
the
in
holiday
dress
the
farmers
and
their
wives
and
a
throng
of
nondescript
idlers
ranging
from
the
servants
of
the
nobility
pushing
their
way
insolently
through
the
crowd
to
those
sinister
vagabonds
who
lurk
as
it
were
in
the
interstices
of
every
concourse
of
people
it
was
not
long
before
the
noise
and
animation
about
him
had
dispelled
odo
the
world
was
too
fair
to
be
darkened
by
a
disdain
and
a
reaction
of
feeling
putting
him
in
tune
with
the
humours
of
the
he
at
once
set
forth
on
foot
to
view
the
city
it
was
now
near
sunset
and
the
day
decline
irradiated
the
stately
front
of
the
cathedral
the
walls
of
the
ancient
hospital
that
faced
it
and
the
groups
gathered
about
the
stalls
and
platforms
obstructing
the
square
even
in
his
odo
was
not
a
figure
to
pass
unnoticed
and
he
was
soon
assailed
by
laughing
compliments
on
his
looks
and
invitations
to
visit
the
various
shows
concealed
behind
the
flapping
curtains
of
the
tents
there
were
enough
pretty
faces
in
the
crowd
to
justify
such
familiarities
and
even
so
modest
a
success
was
not
without
solace
to
his
vanity
he
lingered
for
some
time
in
the
square
answering
the
banter
of
the
blooming
inspecting
the
from
genoa
and
watching
a
little
yellow
bitch
in
a
hooped
petticoat
and
lappets
dance
the
furlana
to
the
music
of
an
armless
fiddler
who
held
the
bow
in
his
teeth
as
he
turned
from
this
show
odo
eye
was
caught
by
a
handsome
girl
who
on
the
arm
of
a
dashing
cavalier
in
somewhat
shabby
velvet
was
cheapening
a
pair
of
gloves
at
a
neighbouring
stall
the
girl
who
was
masked
shot
a
dark
glance
at
odo
from
under
her
venetian
hat
then
tossing
down
a
coin
she
gathered
up
the
gloves
and
drew
her
companion
away
the
manoeuvre
was
almost
a
challenge
and
odo
was
about
to
take
it
up
when
a
pretty
boy
in
a
scaramouch
habit
waylaying
him
with
various
graceful
antics
thrust
a
in
his
hand
and
on
looking
round
he
found
the
girl
and
her
gallant
had
disappeared
the
with
a
wealth
of
theatrical
rhetoric
invited
odo
to
attend
the
performance
to
be
given
that
evening
at
the
philodramatic
academy
by
the
celebrated
capo
comico
tartaglia
of
rimini
and
his
company
of
comedians
who
in
the
presence
of
the
aristocracy
of
vercelli
were
to
present
a
new
comedy
entitled
le
gelosie
di
milord
zambo
with
an
intermezzo
of
singing
and
dancing
by
the
best
performers
of
their
kind
dusk
was
already
falling
and
odo
who
had
brought
no
letters
to
the
gentry
of
vercelli
where
he
intended
to
stay
but
a
night
began
to
wonder
how
he
should
employ
his
evening
he
had
hoped
to
spend
it
in
vivaldi
company
but
the
professor
not
having
invited
him
he
saw
no
prospect
but
to
return
to
the
inn
and
sup
alone
with
cantapresto
in
the
doorway
of
the
three
crowns
he
found
the
soprano
awaiting
him
cantapresto
who
had
been
as
mute
as
a
fish
during
the
drive
now
bustled
forward
with
a
great
show
of
eagerness
what
poet
was
it
he
cried
that
paragoned
youth
to
the
easter
sunshine
which
wherever
it
touches
causes
a
flower
to
spring
up
here
we
are
scarce
alit
in
a
strange
city
and
already
a
messenger
finds
the
way
to
our
inn
with
a
most
particular
word
from
his
lady
to
the
cavaliere
odo
valsecca
and
he
held
out
a
perfumed
billet
sealed
with
a
flaming
dart
odo
heart
gave
a
leap
at
the
thought
that
the
letter
might
be
from
fulvia
but
on
breaking
the
seal
he
read
these
words
scrawled
in
an
unformed
hand
will
the
cavaliere
valsecca
accept
from
an
old
friend
who
desires
to
renew
her
acquaintance
with
him
the
trifling
gift
of
a
at
don
tartaglia
entertainment
this
evening
vexed
at
his
credulity
odo
tossed
the
invitation
to
cantapresto
but
a
moment
later
recalling
the
glance
of
the
pretty
girl
in
the
he
began
to
wonder
if
the
billet
might
not
be
the
prelude
to
a
sufficiently
diverting
adventure
it
at
least
offered
a
way
of
passing
the
evening
and
after
a
hurried
supper
he
set
out
with
cantapresto
for
the
philodramatic
academy
it
was
late
when
they
entered
their
box
and
several
masks
were
already
capering
before
the
footlights
exchanging
lazzi
with
the
townsfolk
in
the
pit
and
addressing
burlesque
compliments
to
the
quality
in
the
boxes
the
theatre
seemed
small
and
shabby
after
those
of
turin
and
there
was
little
in
the
fopperies
of
a
provincial
audience
to
interest
a
young
gentleman
fresh
from
the
capital
odo
looked
about
for
any
one
resembling
the
masked
beauty
of
the
but
he
beheld
only
dowagers
and
matrons
or
ladies
of
the
town
more
conspicuous
for
their
effrontery
than
for
their
charms
the
main
diversion
of
the
evening
was
by
this
begun
it
was
a
comedy
in
the
style
of
goldoni
early
pieces
representing
the
actual
life
of
the
day
but
interspersed
with
the
antics
of
the
masks
to
whose
improvised
drolleries
the
people
still
clung
a
terrific
don
spavento
in
cloak
and
sword
played
the
jealous
english
nobleman
milord
zambo
and
the
part
of
tartaglia
was
taken
by
the
manager
one
of
the
interpreters
of
the
character
in
italy
tartaglia
was
the
guardian
of
the
prima
amorosa
whom
the
enamoured
briton
pursued
and
in
the
columbine
when
she
sprang
upon
the
stage
with
a
pirouette
that
showed
her
slender
ankles
and
embroidered
clocks
odo
instantly
recognised
the
graceful
figure
and
killing
glance
of
his
masked
beauty
her
face
which
was
now
uncovered
more
than
fulfilled
the
promise
of
her
eyes
being
indeed
as
arch
and
engaging
a
countenance
as
ever
flashed
distraction
across
the
she
was
greeted
with
an
outburst
of
delight
that
cost
her
a
sour
glance
from
the
prima
amorosa
and
presently
the
theatre
was
ringing
with
her
improvised
sallies
uttered
in
the
gay
staccato
of
the
venetian
dialect
there
was
to
odo
something
perplexingly
familiar
in
this
accent
and
in
the
light
darting
movements
of
her
little
head
framed
in
a
columbine
ruff
with
a
red
rose
thrust
behind
one
ear
but
after
a
rapid
glance
about
the
house
she
appeared
to
take
no
notice
of
him
and
he
began
to
think
it
must
be
to
some
one
else
he
owed
his
invitation
from
this
question
he
was
soon
diverted
by
his
increasing
enjoyment
of
the
play
it
was
not
indeed
a
remarkable
example
of
its
kind
being
crudely
enough
put
together
and
turning
on
a
series
of
ridiculous
and
disconnected
incidents
but
to
a
taste
formed
on
the
frigid
elegancies
of
metastasio
and
the
french
stage
there
was
something
refreshing
in
this
plunge
into
the
coarse
homely
atmosphere
of
the
old
popular
theatre
extemporaneous
comedies
were
no
longer
played
in
the
great
cities
and
odo
listened
with
surprise
to
the
swift
thrust
and
parry
the
inexhaustible
flow
of
jest
and
repartee
the
readiness
with
which
the
comedians
caught
up
each
other
leads
like
dancers
whirling
without
a
false
step
through
the
mazes
of
some
rapid
contradance
so
engaged
was
he
that
he
no
longer
observed
the
columbine
save
as
a
figure
in
this
flying
reel
but
presently
a
burst
of
laughter
fixed
his
attention
and
he
saw
that
she
was
darting
across
the
stage
pursued
by
milord
zambo
who
furious
at
the
coquetries
of
his
betrothed
was
avenging
himself
by
his
attentions
to
the
columbine
half
way
across
her
foot
caught
and
she
fell
on
one
knee
zambo
rushed
to
the
rescue
but
springing
up
instantly
and
feigning
to
treat
his
advance
as
a
part
of
the
play
she
cried
out
with
a
delicious
assumption
of
outraged
dignity
not
a
step
farther
villain
know
that
it
is
sacrilege
for
a
common
mortal
to
embrace
one
who
has
been
kissed
by
his
most
illustrious
highness
the
of
pianura
mirandolina
of
chioggia
sprang
to
odo
lips
at
the
same
instant
the
columbine
turned
about
and
swept
him
a
deep
curtsey
to
the
delight
of
the
audience
who
had
no
notion
of
what
was
going
forward
but
were
in
the
humour
to
clap
any
whim
of
their
favourite
then
she
turned
and
darted
off
the
stage
and
the
curtain
fell
on
a
tumult
of
applause
odo
had
hardly
recovered
from
his
confusion
when
the
door
of
the
box
opened
and
the
young
scaramouch
he
had
seen
in
the
peeped
in
and
beckoned
to
cantapresto
the
soprano
rose
with
alacrity
leaving
odo
alone
in
the
box
his
mind
agrope
in
a
labyrinth
of
memories
a
moment
later
cantapresto
returned
with
that
air
of
furtive
relish
that
always
proclaimed
him
the
bearer
of
a
tender
message
the
one
he
now
brought
was
to
the
effect
that
the
signorina
miranda
malmocco
justly
renowned
as
one
of
the
first
columbines
of
italy
had
charged
him
to
lay
at
the
cavaliere
valsecca
feet
her
excuses
for
the
liberty
she
had
taken
with
his
illustrious
name
and
to
entreat
that
he
would
show
his
magnanimity
by
supping
with
her
after
the
play
in
her
room
at
the
three
crowns
a
request
she
was
emboldened
to
make
by
the
fact
that
she
was
lately
from
pianura
and
could
give
him
the
last
news
of
the
court
the
message
chimed
with
odo
mood
and
the
play
over
he
hastened
back
to
the
inn
with
cantapresto
and
bid
the
landlord
send
to
the
signorina
miranda
room
whatever
delicacies
the
town
could
provide
odo
on
arriving
that
afternoon
had
himself
given
orders
that
his
carriage
should
be
at
the
door
the
next
morning
an
hour
before
sunrise
and
he
now
repeated
these
instructions
to
cantapresto
charging
him
on
his
life
to
see
that
nothing
interfered
with
their
fulfilment
the
soprano
objected
that
the
hour
was
already
late
and
that
they
could
easily
perform
the
day
journey
without
curtailing
their
rest
but
on
reiteration
of
the
order
he
resigned
himself
with
the
remark
that
it
was
a
pity
old
age
had
no
for
the
sleep
that
youth
squandered
it
was
something
of
a
disappointment
to
odo
on
entering
the
signorina
miranda
room
to
find
that
she
was
not
alone
engaged
in
feeding
her
pet
monkey
with
was
the
young
man
who
had
given
her
his
arm
in
the
piazza
this
gentleman
whom
she
introduced
to
odo
as
her
cousin
and
travelling
companion
the
count
of
castelrovinato
had
the
same
air
of
tarnished
elegance
as
his
coat
and
discoloured
ruffles
he
seemed
however
of
a
lively
and
obliging
humour
and
mirandolina
observed
with
a
smile
that
she
could
give
no
better
notion
of
his
amiability
than
by
mentioning
that
he
was
known
among
her
friends
as
the
cavaliere
frattanto
this
praise
odo
thought
seemed
scarcely
to
the
cousin
liking
but
he
carried
it
off
with
the
philosophic
remark
that
it
is
the
mortar
between
the
bricks
that
holds
the
building
together
at
present
said
mirandolina
laughing
he
is
engaged
in
propping
up
a
ruin
for
he
has
fallen
desperately
in
love
with
our
prima
amorosa
a
lady
who
lost
her
virtue
under
the
pharaohs
but
whom
for
his
sake
i
have
been
obliged
to
include
in
our
little
supper
this
it
was
clear
was
merely
a
way
of
palliating
the
infatuation
for
herself
but
he
took
the
second
thrust
as
as
the
first
remarking
that
he
had
been
bred
for
an
archeologist
and
had
never
lost
his
taste
for
the
antique
odo
servants
now
appearing
with
a
pasty
of
beccafichi
some
bottles
of
old
malaga
and
a
tray
of
ices
and
fruits
the
three
seated
themselves
at
the
table
which
mirandolina
had
decorated
with
a
number
of
wax
candles
stuck
in
the
bottles
of
the
count
here
they
were
speedily
joined
by
the
actress
monkey
and
parrot
who
had
soon
spread
devastation
among
the
dishes
while
miranda
was
restoring
order
by
boxing
the
monkey
ears
and
feeding
the
shrieking
bird
from
her
lips
the
door
opened
to
admit
the
prima
amorosa
a
lady
whose
mature
charms
and
mellifluous
manner
suggested
a
fine
fruit
preserved
in
syrup
the
newcomer
was
clearly
engrossed
in
captivating
the
count
and
the
latter
amply
justified
his
by
the
cynical
complaisance
with
which
he
cleared
the
way
for
odo
by
responding
to
her
advances
the
thus
established
miranda
at
once
began
to
excuse
herself
for
the
means
she
had
taken
to
attract
odo
attention
at
the
theatre
she
had
heard
from
the
innkeeper
that
the
duke
of
cousin
the
cavaliere
valsecca
was
expected
that
day
in
vercelli
and
seeing
in
the
piazza
a
young
gentleman
in
and
french
toupet
had
at
once
guessed
him
to
be
the
distinguished
stranger
from
turin
at
the
theatre
she
had
been
much
amused
by
the
air
of
apprehension
with
which
odo
had
appeared
to
seek
among
the
dowdy
or
vulgar
inmates
of
the
boxes
the
sender
of
the
mysterious
billet
and
the
contrast
between
the
elegant
gentleman
in
embroidered
coat
and
sword
and
the
sleepy
bewildered
little
boy
of
the
midnight
feast
at
chivasso
had
seized
her
with
such
comic
effect
that
she
could
not
resist
a
playful
allusion
to
their
former
meeting
all
this
was
set
forth
with
so
sprightly
an
air
of
that
had
odo
felt
the
least
resentment
it
must
instantly
have
vanished
he
was
however
in
the
humour
to
be
pleased
by
whatever
took
his
mind
off
his
own
affairs
and
none
could
be
more
skilled
than
mirandolina
in
profiting
by
such
a
mood
he
pressed
her
to
tell
him
something
of
what
had
befallen
her
since
they
had
met
but
she
replied
by
questioning
him
about
his
own
experiences
and
on
learning
that
he
had
been
called
to
pianura
on
account
of
the
heir
she
declared
it
was
notorious
that
the
little
prince
had
not
long
to
live
and
that
the
duke
could
not
hope
for
another
son
the
duke
life
however
said
odo
is
as
good
as
mine
and
in
truth
i
am
far
less
moved
by
my
remote
hopes
of
the
succession
than
by
the
near
prospect
of
visiting
so
many
famous
cities
and
seeing
so
much
that
is
novel
and
entertaining
miranda
shrugged
her
pretty
shoulders
why
as
to
the
duke
life
said
she
there
are
some
that
would
not
give
a
counterfeit
penny
for
it
but
indeed
his
highness
lives
so
secluded
from
the
world
and
is
surrounded
by
persons
so
jealous
to
conceal
his
true
condition
even
from
the
court
that
the
reports
of
his
health
are
no
more
to
be
trusted
than
the
other
strange
rumours
about
him
i
was
told
in
pianura
that
but
four
persons
are
admitted
to
his
familiarity
his
confessor
his
mistress
count
trescorre
who
is
already
comptroller
of
finance
and
will
soon
be
and
a
strange
german
doctor
or
astrologer
that
is
lately
come
to
the
court
as
to
the
duchess
she
never
sees
him
and
were
it
not
for
trescorre
who
has
had
the
wit
to
stand
well
with
both
sides
i
doubt
if
she
would
know
more
of
what
goes
on
about
her
husband
than
any
scullion
in
the
ducal
kitchens
she
spoke
with
the
air
of
one
with
the
subject
and
odo
curious
to
learn
more
asked
her
how
she
came
to
have
such
an
insight
into
the
intrigues
of
the
court
why
said
she
in
the
oddest
way
imaginable
by
being
the
guest
of
his
lordship
the
bishop
of
pianura
and
since
you
asked
me
just
now
to
tell
you
something
of
my
adventures
i
will
if
you
please
begin
by
relating
the
occurrences
that
procured
me
this
extraordinary
honour
but
first
she
added
with
a
smile
would
it
not
be
well
to
open
another
bottle
of
malaga
mirandolina
story
you
must
know
she
continued
when
odo
had
complied
with
her
request
that
soon
after
our
parting
at
chivasso
the
company
with
which
i
was
travelling
came
to
grief
through
the
dishonesty
of
the
harlequin
who
ran
away
with
the
capo
comico
wife
carrying
with
him
besides
the
lady
the
far
more
irretrievable
treasure
of
our
modest
earnings
this
brought
us
to
destitution
and
the
troop
was
disbanded
i
had
nothing
but
the
spangled
frock
on
my
back
and
thinking
to
make
some
use
of
my
sole
possession
i
set
out
as
a
dancer
with
the
of
the
company
a
fellow
that
had
a
performing
marmozet
from
the
indies
we
three
wandered
from
one
town
to
another
spreading
our
carpet
wherever
there
was
a
fair
or
a
going
hungry
in
bad
seasons
and
in
our
luckier
days
attaching
ourselves
to
some
band
of
strolling
or
comedians
one
day
after
about
a
year
of
this
life
i
had
the
good
fortune
in
the
of
parma
to
attract
the
notice
of
a
rich
english
nobleman
who
was
engaged
in
writing
a
book
on
the
dances
of
the
ancients
this
gentleman
though
no
longer
young
and
afflicted
with
that
strange
english
malady
that
obliges
a
man
to
wrap
his
feet
in
like
a
infant
was
of
a
generous
and
paternal
disposition
and
offered
if
i
would
accompany
him
to
florence
to
give
me
a
home
and
a
genteel
education
i
remained
with
him
about
two
years
during
which
time
he
had
me
carefully
instructed
in
music
french
and
the
art
of
the
needle
in
return
for
this
my
principal
duties
were
to
perform
in
antique
dances
before
the
friends
of
my
benefactor
whose
name
i
could
never
learn
to
pronounce
and
to
read
aloud
to
him
the
works
of
the
modern
historians
and
philosophers
we
lived
in
a
large
palace
with
exceedingly
rooms
which
my
friend
would
never
have
warmed
on
account
of
his
plethoric
habit
and
as
i
had
to
dance
at
all
seasons
in
the
light
draperies
worn
by
the
classical
goddesses
i
suffered
terribly
from
chilblains
and
contracted
a
cruel
cough
to
this
however
i
might
have
resigned
myself
but
when
i
learned
from
a
young
abate
who
frequented
the
house
that
the
books
i
was
compelled
to
read
were
condemned
by
the
church
and
could
not
be
perused
without
deadly
peril
to
the
soul
i
at
once
resolved
to
fly
from
such
contaminating
influences
knowing
that
his
lordship
would
not
consent
to
my
leaving
him
i
took
the
matter
out
of
his
hands
by
slipping
out
one
day
during
the
carnival
carrying
with
me
from
that
accursed
house
nothing
but
the
few
jewels
that
my
benefactor
had
expressed
the
intention
of
leaving
me
in
his
will
at
the
nearest
church
i
confessed
my
involuntary
sin
in
reading
the
prohibited
books
and
having
received
absolution
and
the
sacrament
i
joined
my
friend
the
abate
at
cafaggiolo
whence
we
travelled
to
modena
where
he
was
acquainted
with
a
theatrical
manager
just
then
in
search
of
a
columbine
my
dancing
and
posturing
at
florence
had
given
me
something
of
a
name
among
the
dilettanti
and
i
was
at
once
engaged
by
the
manager
who
took
me
to
venice
where
i
subsequently
joined
the
company
of
the
excellent
tartaglia
with
whom
i
am
now
acting
since
then
i
have
been
attended
by
continued
success
which
i
can
not
but
ascribe
to
my
virtuous
resolve
to
face
poverty
and
distress
rather
than
profit
a
moment
longer
by
the
beneficence
of
an
atheist
all
this
i
have
related
to
show
you
how
the
poor
ignorant
girl
you
met
at
chivasso
was
able
to
acquire
something
of
the
arts
and
usages
of
good
company
but
i
will
now
pass
on
to
the
incident
of
my
visit
to
pianura
our
manager
then
had
engaged
some
time
since
to
give
a
series
of
performances
at
pianura
during
the
last
carnival
the
bishop
nephew
don
serafino
who
has
a
pronounced
taste
for
the
theatre
had
been
instrumental
in
making
the
arrangement
but
at
the
last
moment
he
wrote
us
that
owing
to
the
influence
of
the
duke
confessor
the
bishop
had
been
obliged
to
prohibit
the
appearance
of
women
on
the
stage
of
pianura
this
was
a
cruel
blow
as
we
had
prepared
a
number
of
comedies
in
which
i
was
to
act
the
leading
part
and
don
serafino
was
equally
vexed
since
he
did
me
the
honour
of
regarding
me
as
the
chief
ornament
of
the
company
at
length
it
was
agreed
that
to
overcome
the
difficulty
it
should
be
given
out
that
the
celebrated
tartaglia
of
rimini
would
present
himself
at
pianura
with
his
company
of
comedians
among
whom
was
the
popular
favourite
mirandolino
of
chioggia
twin
brother
of
the
signorina
miranda
malmocco
and
trained
by
that
actress
to
play
in
all
her
principal
parts
this
satisfied
the
scruples
and
interests
of
all
concerned
and
soon
afterward
i
made
my
first
appearance
in
pianura
my
success
was
greater
than
we
had
foreseen
for
i
threw
myself
into
the
part
with
such
zest
that
every
one
was
taken
in
and
even
don
serafino
required
the
most
categorical
demonstration
to
convince
him
that
i
was
not
my
own
brother
the
illusion
i
produced
was
however
not
without
its
inconveniences
for
among
the
ladies
who
thronged
to
see
the
young
mirandolino
were
several
who
desired
a
closer
acquaintance
with
him
and
one
of
these
as
it
happened
was
the
duke
mistress
the
countess
belverde
you
will
see
the
embarrassment
of
my
situation
if
i
failed
to
respond
to
her
advances
her
influence
was
sufficient
to
drive
us
from
the
town
at
the
opening
of
a
prosperous
season
if
i
discovered
my
sex
to
her
she
might
more
cruelly
avenge
herself
by
throwing
the
whole
company
into
prison
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
holy
office
under
these
circumstances
i
decided
to
appeal
to
the
bishop
but
without
of
course
revealing
to
him
that
i
was
so
to
speak
my
own
sister
his
lordship
who
is
never
sorry
to
do
the
belverde
a
bad
turn
received
me
with
the
utmost
indulgence
and
declared
that
to
protect
my
innocence
from
the
designs
of
this
new
potiphar
wife
he
would
not
only
give
me
a
lodging
in
the
episcopal
palace
but
confer
on
me
the
additional
protection
of
the
minor
orders
this
was
rather
more
than
i
had
bargained
for
but
he
that
wants
the
melon
is
a
fool
to
refuse
the
rind
and
i
thanked
the
bishop
for
his
kindness
and
allowed
him
to
give
out
that
my
heart
having
been
touched
by
grace
i
had
resolved
at
the
end
of
the
season
to
withdraw
from
the
stage
and
prepare
to
enter
the
church
i
now
fancied
myself
safe
for
i
knew
the
countess
could
not
attempt
my
removal
without
risk
of
having
her
passion
denounced
to
the
duke
i
spent
several
days
very
agreeably
in
the
episcopal
palace
entertained
at
his
lordship
own
table
and
favoured
with
private
conversations
during
which
he
told
me
many
curious
and
interesting
things
about
the
duke
and
the
court
and
delicately
abstained
from
all
allusion
to
my
coming
change
of
vocation
the
countess
however
had
not
been
idle
one
day
i
received
notice
that
the
holy
office
disapproved
of
the
appearance
on
the
stage
of
a
young
man
about
to
enter
the
church
and
requested
me
to
withdraw
at
once
to
the
barnabite
monastery
where
i
was
to
remain
till
i
received
the
minor
orders
now
the
abbot
of
the
barnabites
was
the
belverde
brother
and
i
saw
at
once
that
to
obey
his
order
would
place
me
in
that
lady
power
i
again
addressed
myself
to
the
bishop
but
to
my
despair
he
declared
himself
unable
to
aid
me
farther
saying
that
he
dared
not
offend
the
holy
office
and
that
he
had
already
run
considerable
risk
in
protecting
me
from
the
countess
i
was
accordingly
transferred
to
the
monastery
in
spite
of
my
own
entreaties
and
those
of
the
good
tartaglia
who
moved
heaven
and
earth
to
save
his
columbine
from
sequestration
you
may
imagine
my
despair
my
fear
of
doing
tartaglia
an
injury
kept
me
from
revealing
my
sex
and
for
hours
i
languished
in
my
cell
refusing
food
and
air
and
resisting
the
repeated
attempts
of
the
good
monks
to
alleviate
my
distress
at
length
however
i
bethought
me
that
the
countess
would
soon
appear
and
it
flashed
across
me
that
the
one
person
who
could
protect
me
from
her
was
her
brother
i
at
once
sought
an
interview
with
the
abbot
who
received
me
with
great
indulgence
i
explained
to
him
that
the
distress
i
suffered
was
occasioned
by
the
loss
that
my
sequestration
was
causing
my
excellent
manager
and
begged
him
to
use
his
influence
to
have
me
released
from
the
monastery
the
abbot
listened
attentively
and
after
a
pause
replied
that
there
was
but
one
person
who
could
arrange
the
matter
and
that
was
his
sister
the
countess
belverde
whose
piety
gave
her
considerable
influence
in
such
matters
i
now
saw
that
no
alternative
remained
but
to
confess
the
truth
and
with
tears
of
agitation
i
avowed
my
sex
and
threw
myself
on
his
mercy
i
was
not
disappointed
in
the
result
the
abbot
listened
with
the
greatest
benevolence
to
all
the
details
of
my
adventure
he
laughed
heartily
at
his
sister
delusion
but
said
i
had
done
right
in
not
undeceiving
her
as
her
dread
of
ridicule
might
have
led
to
unpleasant
reprisals
he
declared
that
for
the
present
he
could
not
on
any
account
consent
to
let
me
out
of
his
protection
but
he
promised
if
i
submitted
myself
implicitly
to
his
guidance
not
only
to
preserve
me
from
the
belverde
machinations
but
to
ensure
my
reappearing
on
the
stage
within
two
days
at
the
latest
knowing
him
to
be
a
very
powerful
personage
i
thought
it
best
to
accept
these
conditions
which
in
any
case
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
resist
and
the
next
day
he
informed
me
that
the
holy
office
had
consented
to
the
signorina
miranda
malmocco
appearing
on
the
stage
of
pianura
during
the
remainder
of
the
season
in
consideration
of
the
financial
injury
caused
to
the
manager
of
the
company
by
the
edifying
conversion
of
her
in
this
way
the
abbot
was
pleased
to
explain
you
will
be
quite
safe
from
my
sister
who
is
a
woman
of
the
most
unexceptionable
morals
and
at
the
same
time
you
will
not
expose
our
excellent
bishop
to
the
charge
of
having
been
a
party
to
a
grave
infraction
of
ecclesiastical
my
only
condition
he
added
with
a
truly
paternal
smile
is
that
after
the
signorina
miranda
performance
at
the
theatre
her
the
signor
mirandolino
shall
return
every
evening
to
the
monastery
a
condition
which
seems
necessary
to
the
preservation
of
our
secret
and
which
i
trust
you
will
not
regard
as
too
onerous
in
view
of
the
service
i
have
been
happy
enough
to
render
you
it
would
have
ill
become
me
to
dispute
the
excellent
wishes
and
tartaglia
and
the
rest
of
the
company
having
been
sworn
to
secrecy
i
reappeared
that
very
evening
in
one
of
my
favourite
parts
and
was
afterward
carried
back
to
the
monastery
in
the
most
private
manner
the
signorina
malmocco
successes
soon
repaired
the
loss
occasioned
by
her
brother
withdrawal
and
if
any
suspected
their
identity
all
were
interested
to
conceal
their
suspicions
thus
it
came
about
that
my
visit
to
pianura
having
begun
under
the
roof
of
a
bishop
ended
in
a
monastery
of
barnabites
nor
have
i
any
cause
to
complain
of
the
hospitality
of
either
of
my
hosts
odo
charmed
by
the
vivacity
with
which
this
artless
narrative
was
related
pressed
miranda
to
continue
the
history
of
her
adventures
the
actress
laughingly
protested
that
she
must
first
refresh
herself
with
one
of
the
ices
he
had
so
handsomely
provided
and
meanwhile
she
begged
the
count
to
favour
them
with
a
song
this
gentleman
who
seemed
glad
of
any
pretext
for
detaching
himself
from
his
elderly
flame
rescued
mirandolina
lute
from
the
inquisitive
fingering
of
the
monkey
and
striking
a
few
melancholy
chords
sang
the
following
words
which
he
said
he
had
learned
from
a
peasant
of
the
abruzzi
flower
of
the
thyme
she
draws
me
as
your
fragrance
draws
the
bees
she
draws
me
as
the
cold
moon
draws
the
seas
and
summer
flower
of
the
broom
like
you
she
blossoms
over
dark
abysses
and
close
to
ruin
bloom
her
sweetest
kisses
and
on
the
brink
of
doom
flower
of
the
rue
she
wore
you
on
her
breast
when
first
we
met
i
begged
your
blossom
and
i
wear
it
yet
flower
of
regret
the
song
ended
the
prima
amorosa
overcome
by
what
she
visibly
deemed
an
appeal
to
her
feelings
declared
with
some
agitation
that
the
hour
was
late
and
she
must
withdraw
miranda
wished
the
actress
an
affectionate
goodnight
and
asked
the
count
to
light
her
to
her
room
which
was
on
the
farther
side
of
the
gallery
surrounding
the
courtyard
of
the
inn
castelrovinato
complied
with
his
usual
air
of
resignation
and
the
door
closing
on
the
couple
odo
and
miranda
found
themselves
alone
and
now
said
the
girl
placing
herself
on
the
sofa
and
turning
to
her
guest
with
a
smile
if
you
will
take
a
seat
at
my
side
i
will
gladly
continue
the
history
of
my
adventures
odo
woke
with
a
start
he
had
been
trying
to
break
down
a
great
gate
behind
which
fulvia
pale
and
disordered
struggled
in
the
clutch
of
the
blind
beggar
of
the
corpus
domini
he
sat
up
and
looked
about
him
the
gate
was
still
there
but
as
he
gazed
it
resolved
itself
into
his
shuttered
window
barred
with
wide
lines
of
sunlight
it
was
day
then
he
sprang
out
of
bed
and
flung
open
the
shutters
beneath
him
lay
the
piazza
of
vercelli
bathed
in
the
vertical
brightness
of
a
summer
noon
and
as
he
stared
out
on
this
inexorable
scene
the
clock
over
the
hospital
struck
twelve
twelve
and
he
had
promised
to
meet
vivaldi
at
dawn
behind
the
umiliati
as
the
truth
forced
itself
on
odo
he
dropped
into
a
chair
and
hid
his
face
with
a
groan
he
had
failed
them
again
then
and
this
time
how
cruelly
and
basely
he
felt
himself
the
victim
of
a
conspiracy
which
in
some
occult
manner
was
forever
forcing
him
to
outrage
and
betray
the
two
beings
he
most
longed
to
serve
the
idea
of
a
conspiracy
flashed
a
sudden
light
on
his
evening
diversion
and
he
sprang
up
with
a
cry
yes
it
was
a
plot
and
any
but
a
dolt
must
have
traced
the
hand
in
this
vulgar
assault
upon
his
senses
he
choked
with
anger
at
the
thought
of
having
played
the
dupe
when
two
lives
he
cherished
were
staked
upon
his
vigilance
to
his
furious
summons
cantapresto
presented
a
blank
wall
of
ignorance
yes
the
cavaliere
had
given
orders
that
the
carriage
should
be
ready
before
daybreak
but
who
was
authorised
to
wake
the
cavaliere
after
keeping
the
carriage
two
hours
at
the
door
cantapresto
had
ventured
to
send
it
back
to
the
stable
but
the
horses
should
instantly
be
put
to
and
within
an
hour
they
would
be
well
forward
on
their
journey
meanwhile
should
the
barber
be
summoned
at
once
or
would
the
cavaliere
first
refresh
himself
with
an
excellent
cup
of
chocolate
prepared
under
cantapresto
own
supervision
odo
turned
on
him
savagely
traitor
spy
in
whose
pay
but
the
words
roused
him
to
a
fresh
sense
of
peril
cantapresto
though
he
might
have
guessed
odo
intention
was
not
privy
to
his
plan
of
rejoining
vivaldi
and
fulvia
and
it
flashed
across
the
young
man
that
his
must
confirm
the
others
suspicions
his
one
hope
of
protecting
his
friends
was
to
affect
indifference
to
what
had
happened
and
this
was
made
easier
by
the
reflection
that
cantapresto
was
after
all
but
a
tool
in
more
powerful
hands
to
be
spied
on
was
so
natural
to
an
italian
of
that
day
that
the
victim
instinct
was
rather
to
circumvent
the
spy
than
to
denounce
him
odo
dismissed
cantapresto
with
the
reply
that
he
would
give
orders
about
the
carriage
later
desiring
that
meanwhile
the
soprano
should
purchase
the
handsomest
set
of
filigree
ornaments
to
be
found
in
vercelli
and
carry
them
with
the
cavaliere
valsecca
compliments
to
the
signorina
malmocco
having
thus
rid
himself
of
observation
he
dressed
as
rapidly
as
possible
trying
the
while
to
devise
some
means
of
tracing
vivaldi
but
the
longer
he
pondered
the
attempt
the
more
plainly
he
saw
its
futility
vivaldi
doubtless
from
motives
of
prudence
had
not
named
the
friend
with
whom
he
and
fulvia
were
to
take
shelter
nor
did
odo
even
know
in
what
quarter
of
the
city
to
seek
them
to
question
the
police
was
to
risk
their
last
chance
of
safety
and
for
the
same
reason
he
dared
not
enquire
of
the
whether
any
travellers
had
set
out
that
morning
for
lombardy
his
natural
activity
of
mind
was
hampered
by
a
leaden
sense
of
remissness
with
what
anguish
of
spirit
must
vivaldi
and
fulvia
have
awaited
him
in
that
hour
of
dawn
behind
the
convent
what
thoughts
must
have
visited
the
girl
mind
as
day
broadened
the
city
woke
and
peril
pressed
on
them
with
every
voice
and
eye
and
when
at
length
they
saw
that
he
had
failed
them
which
way
did
their
hunted
footsteps
turn
perhaps
they
dared
not
go
back
to
the
friend
who
had
taken
them
in
for
the
night
perhaps
even
now
they
wandered
through
the
streets
fearing
arrest
if
they
revealed
themselves
by
venturing
to
engage
a
carriage
at
every
turn
of
his
thoughts
odo
was
mocked
by
some
vision
of
disaster
and
an
hour
of
perplexity
yielded
no
happier
expedient
than
that
of
repairing
to
the
behind
the
umiliati
it
was
a
deserted
lane
with
few
passers
and
after
vainly
questioning
the
blank
wall
of
the
convent
and
the
gates
of
a
that
faced
it
he
retraced
his
steps
to
the
inn
he
spent
a
day
of
futile
research
and
bitter
thoughts
now
straying
forth
in
the
hope
of
meeting
vivaldi
now
hastening
back
to
the
three
crowns
on
the
chance
that
some
message
might
await
him
he
dared
not
let
his
mind
rest
on
what
might
have
befallen
his
friends
yet
the
alternative
of
contemplating
his
own
course
was
scarcely
more
endurable
nightfall
brought
the
conviction
that
the
professor
and
fulvia
had
passed
beyond
his
reach
it
was
clear
that
if
they
were
still
in
vercelli
they
did
not
mean
to
make
their
presence
known
to
him
while
in
the
event
of
their
escape
he
was
without
means
of
tracing
them
farther
he
knew
indeed
that
their
destination
was
milan
but
should
they
reach
there
safely
what
hope
was
there
of
finding
them
in
a
city
of
strangers
by
a
stroke
of
folly
he
had
cut
himself
off
from
all
communication
with
them
and
his
misery
was
enhanced
by
the
discovery
of
his
weakness
he
who
had
fed
his
fancy
on
high
visions
cherishing
in
himself
the
latent
patriot
and
hero
had
been
driven
by
a
girl
caprice
to
break
the
first
law
of
manliness
and
honour
the
event
had
already
justified
her
and
in
a
flash
of
he
saw
himself
as
she
no
doubt
beheld
him
the
fribble
preying
like
a
summer
insect
on
the
slow
growths
of
difficult
years
in
bitterness
of
spirit
he
set
out
the
next
morning
for
pianura
a
interest
drew
him
back
to
the
scene
of
his
lonely
childhood
and
he
had
started
early
in
order
to
push
on
that
night
to
pontesordo
at
valsecca
the
regular
between
vercelli
and
pianura
he
sent
cantapresto
forward
to
the
capital
and
in
a
stormy
yellow
twilight
drove
alone
across
the
waste
land
that
dipped
to
the
marshes
on
his
right
the
woods
of
the
ducal
chase
hung
black
against
the
sky
and
presently
he
saw
ahead
of
him
the
old
square
keep
with
a
flight
of
swallows
circling
low
about
its
walls
in
the
muddy
a
young
man
was
belabouring
a
donkey
laden
with
he
stared
for
a
moment
at
odo
approach
and
then
sullenly
returned
to
his
task
odo
sprang
out
into
the
mud
why
do
you
beat
the
brute
said
he
indignantly
the
other
turned
a
dull
face
on
him
and
he
recognised
his
old
enemy
giannozzo
giannozzo
he
cried
do
you
know
me
i
am
the
cavaliere
valsecca
whose
ears
you
used
to
box
when
you
were
a
lad
must
you
always
be
pummelling
something
that
you
ca
let
that
poor
brute
alone
at
the
end
of
its
day
work
giannozzo
dropping
his
staff
stammered
out
that
he
craved
his
excellency
pardon
for
not
knowing
him
but
that
as
for
the
ass
it
was
a
stubborn
devil
that
would
not
have
carried
jesus
christ
without
gibbing
the
beast
is
tired
and
hungry
cried
odo
his
old
compassion
for
the
sufferings
of
the
suddenly
reviving
how
many
hours
have
you
worked
it
without
rest
or
food
no
more
than
i
have
worked
myself
said
giannozzo
sulkily
and
as
for
its
being
hungry
why
should
it
fare
better
than
its
masters
their
words
had
called
out
of
the
house
a
lean
bent
woman
whose
shrivelled
skin
showed
through
the
rents
in
her
unbleached
shift
at
sight
of
odo
she
pushed
giannozzo
aside
and
hurried
forward
to
ask
how
she
might
serve
the
gentleman
with
supper
and
a
bed
my
good
filomena
said
odo
and
she
flung
herself
at
his
feet
with
a
cry
saints
of
heaven
that
i
should
not
have
known
his
excellency
but
i
am
half
blind
with
the
fever
and
who
could
have
dreamed
of
such
an
honour
she
clung
to
his
knees
in
the
mud
kissing
his
hands
and
calling
down
blessings
on
him
and
as
for
you
giannozzo
you
fool
quick
see
that
his
excellency
horses
are
stabled
and
go
call
your
father
from
the
while
i
prepare
his
supper
and
fetch
me
in
a
faggot
to
light
the
fire
in
the
parlour
odo
followed
her
into
the
kitchen
where
he
had
so
often
crouched
in
a
corner
to
eat
his
polenta
out
of
reach
of
her
vigorous
arm
the
roof
seemed
lower
and
more
than
ever
but
the
hearth
was
cold
and
he
noticed
that
no
supper
was
laid
filomena
led
him
into
the
bailiff
parlour
where
a
mortal
chill
seized
him
cobwebs
hung
from
the
walls
the
were
broken
and
caked
with
grime
and
the
few
green
twigs
which
giannozzo
presently
threw
on
the
hearth
poured
a
cloud
of
smoke
into
the
cold
heavy
air
there
was
a
long
delay
while
supper
was
preparing
and
when
at
length
filomena
appeared
it
was
only
to
produce
with
many
excuses
a
loaf
of
a
bit
of
cheese
and
some
dried
quinces
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
house
she
declared
not
so
much
as
a
bit
of
lard
to
make
soup
with
a
handful
of
pasti
or
a
flask
of
wine
in
the
old
days
as
his
excellency
might
remember
they
had
eaten
a
bit
of
meat
on
sundays
and
drunk
aquarolle
with
their
supper
but
since
the
new
taxes
it
was
as
much
as
the
farmers
could
do
to
feed
their
cattle
without
having
a
scrap
to
spare
for
themselves
jacopone
she
continued
was
bent
double
with
the
rheumatism
and
had
not
been
able
to
drive
a
plough
or
to
work
in
the
mulberries
for
over
two
years
he
and
the
sat
in
the
when
their
work
was
over
for
the
sake
of
the
heat
and
she
carried
their
black
bread
out
there
to
them
a
cold
supper
tasted
better
in
a
warm
place
and
as
his
excellency
knew
all
the
windows
in
the
house
were
unglazed
save
in
the
bailiff
parlour
her
man
would
be
in
presently
to
pay
his
duty
to
his
excellency
but
he
had
grown
since
the
rheumatism
took
him
and
his
excellency
must
not
take
it
ill
if
his
talk
was
a
little
childish
thereupon
filomena
excused
herself
that
she
might
put
a
clean
shirt
on
jacopone
and
odo
was
left
to
his
melancholy
musings
his
mind
had
of
late
run
much
on
economic
abuses
but
what
was
any
philandering
with
reform
to
this
close
contact
with
misery
it
was
as
though
white
hungry
faces
had
suddenly
stared
in
at
the
windows
of
his
life
what
did
these
people
care
for
education
enlightenment
the
religion
of
humanity
what
they
wanted
was
fodder
for
their
cattle
a
bit
of
meat
on
sundays
and
a
faggot
on
the
hearth
filomena
presently
returned
with
her
husband
but
jacopone
had
shrunk
into
a
crippled
tremulous
old
man
who
pulled
a
vague
forelock
at
odo
without
sign
of
recognition
filomena
it
was
clear
was
master
at
pontesordo
for
though
giannozzo
was
a
man
grown
and
did
a
man
work
he
still
danced
to
the
tune
of
his
mother
tongue
it
was
from
her
that
odo
shivering
over
the
smoky
hearth
gathered
the
details
of
their
wretched
state
pontesordo
being
a
part
of
the
ducal
domain
they
had
led
in
their
old
days
an
easier
life
than
their
neighbours
but
the
new
taxes
had
stripped
them
as
bare
as
a
in
june
how
is
a
christian
to
live
excellency
with
the
doubled
so
that
the
cows
go
dry
for
want
of
it
with
half
a
zecchin
on
every
pair
of
oxen
a
stajo
of
wheat
and
two
fowls
to
the
parish
and
not
so
much
as
a
bite
of
grass
allowed
on
the
duke
lands
in
his
late
day
the
poor
folk
were
allowed
to
graze
their
cattle
on
the
borders
of
the
chase
but
now
a
man
dare
not
pluck
a
handful
of
weeds
there
or
so
much
as
pick
up
a
fallen
twig
though
the
deer
may
trample
his
young
wheat
and
feed
off
the
patch
of
beans
at
his
very
door
they
do
say
the
duchess
has
a
kind
heart
and
gives
away
money
to
the
but
we
who
spend
our
lives
raising
fodder
for
her
game
never
hear
of
her
highness
but
when
one
of
her
comes
down
on
us
for
poaching
or
stealing
yes
by
the
saints
and
it
was
her
highness
who
sent
a
neighbour
lad
to
the
galleys
last
year
for
felling
a
tree
in
the
chase
a
good
lad
as
ever
dug
furrow
but
he
lacked
wood
for
a
new
and
how
in
god
name
was
he
to
plough
his
field
without
it
so
she
went
on
like
a
torrent
after
the
spring
rains
but
when
he
named
momola
she
fell
silent
and
giannozzo
looking
sideways
drummed
with
his
heel
on
the
floor
odo
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
she
dead
then
he
cried
filomena
opened
deprecating
palms
can
one
tell
excellency
it
may
be
she
is
off
with
the
gypsies
the
gypsies
how
long
since
giannozzo
cried
his
mother
as
he
stood
glowering
go
see
that
the
stable
is
locked
and
his
excellency
horses
bedded
down
he
slunk
out
and
she
began
to
gather
up
the
remains
of
odo
meagre
supper
but
you
must
remember
when
this
happened
holy
mother
it
was
the
year
we
had
frost
in
april
and
lost
our
hatching
for
want
of
leaves
but
as
for
that
child
of
ingratitude
one
day
she
was
here
the
next
she
was
gone
clean
gone
as
a
nut
drops
from
the
tree
and
i
that
had
given
the
blood
of
my
veins
to
nourish
her
since
then
god
is
my
witness
we
have
had
nothing
but
misfortune
the
next
year
it
was
the
weevils
in
the
wheat
and
so
it
goes
odo
was
silent
seeing
it
was
vain
to
press
her
he
fancied
that
the
girl
must
have
died
of
neglect
perhaps
or
ill
usage
and
that
they
feared
to
own
it
his
heart
swelled
but
not
against
them
they
seemed
to
him
no
more
accountable
than
cowed
animals
he
tossed
impatiently
on
the
hard
bed
filomena
had
made
up
for
him
in
the
bailiff
parlour
and
was
afoot
again
with
the
first
light
stepping
out
into
the
he
looked
abroad
over
the
flat
grey
face
of
the
land
around
the
keep
stretched
the
fields
and
the
pollarded
mulberry
orchards
but
these
with
the
clustered
hovels
of
the
village
formed
a
mere
islet
in
the
surrounding
waste
of
marsh
and
woodland
the
scene
symbolised
fitly
enough
of
social
conditions
of
the
country
the
peasantry
huddled
on
their
scant
patches
of
arable
ground
while
miles
of
barren
land
represented
the
feudal
rights
that
hemmed
them
in
on
every
side
odo
walked
across
the
yard
to
the
chapel
on
the
threshold
he
stumbled
over
a
heap
of
and
a
broken
twilight
held
the
place
but
as
he
stood
there
the
frescoes
started
out
in
the
slant
of
the
sunrise
like
dead
faces
floating
to
the
surface
of
a
river
dead
faces
yes
plaintive
spectres
of
his
childish
fears
and
longings
lost
in
the
harsh
daylight
of
experience
he
had
forgotten
the
very
dreams
they
stood
for
lethe
flowed
between
and
only
one
voice
reached
across
the
torrent
it
was
that
of
saint
francis
lover
of
the
poor
the
morning
was
hot
as
odo
drove
toward
pianura
and
limping
ahead
of
him
in
the
midday
glare
he
presently
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
in
a
decent
black
dress
and
hat
there
was
something
familiar
in
the
man
gait
and
in
the
shape
of
his
large
head
poised
on
narrow
stooping
shoulders
and
as
the
carriage
drew
abreast
of
him
odo
leaning
from
the
window
cried
out
brutus
this
must
be
brutus
your
excellency
has
the
advantage
of
me
said
the
hunchback
turning
on
him
a
thin
face
lit
by
the
keen
eyes
that
had
once
searched
his
childish
soul
odo
met
the
rebuff
with
a
smile
does
that
said
he
prevent
my
suggesting
that
you
might
continue
your
way
more
comfortably
in
my
carriage
the
road
is
hot
and
dusty
and
as
you
see
i
am
in
want
of
company
the
pedestrian
who
seemed
unprepared
for
this
affable
rejoinder
had
the
sheepish
air
of
a
man
whose
rudeness
has
missed
the
mark
why
sir
said
he
recovering
himself
comfort
is
all
a
matter
of
habit
and
i
daresay
the
jolting
of
your
carriage
might
seem
to
me
more
unpleasant
than
the
heat
and
dust
of
the
road
to
which
necessity
has
long
since
accustomed
me
in
that
case
returned
odo
with
increasing
amusement
you
will
have
the
additional
merit
of
sacrificing
your
pleasure
to
add
to
mine
the
hunchback
stared
and
what
have
you
or
yours
ever
done
for
me
he
retorted
that
i
should
sacrifice
to
your
pleasure
even
the
wretched
privilege
of
being
dusted
by
the
wheels
of
your
coach
why
that
replied
odo
is
a
question
i
can
scarce
answer
till
you
give
me
the
opportunity
of
naming
if
you
are
indeed
carlo
gamba
he
continued
i
am
your
old
friend
and
companion
odo
valsecca
the
hunchback
started
the
cavaliere
valsecca
he
cried
i
had
heard
that
you
were
expected
he
stood
gazing
at
odo
our
next
duke
he
muttered
odo
smiled
i
had
rather
he
said
that
my
past
commended
me
than
my
future
it
is
more
than
doubtful
if
i
am
ever
able
to
offer
you
a
seat
in
the
duke
carriage
but
odo
valsecca
is
very
much
at
your
service
gamba
bowed
with
a
kind
of
awkward
dignity
i
am
grateful
for
a
friend
kindness
he
said
but
i
do
not
ride
in
a
carriage
there
returned
odo
with
perfect
you
have
had
advantage
of
me
for
i
can
no
more
escape
doing
so
than
you
can
escape
spending
your
life
in
the
company
of
an
man
and
courteously
lifting
his
hat
he
called
to
the
postillion
to
drive
on
the
hunchback
at
this
flushing
red
laid
a
hand
on
the
carriage
door
sir
said
he
i
freely
own
myself
in
the
wrong
but
a
smooth
temper
was
not
one
of
the
blessings
my
unknown
parents
bequeathed
to
me
and
i
confess
i
had
heard
of
you
as
one
little
concerned
with
your
inferiors
except
as
they
might
chance
to
serve
your
pleasure
it
was
odo
turn
to
colour
look
said
he
at
the
fallibility
of
rumour
for
i
had
heard
of
you
as
something
of
a
philosopher
and
here
i
find
you
not
only
taking
a
man
character
on
hearsay
but
denying
him
the
chance
to
prove
you
mistaken
i
deny
it
no
longer
said
gamba
stepping
into
the
coach
but
as
to
philosophy
the
only
claim
i
can
make
to
it
is
that
of
being
by
birth
a
peripatetic
his
dignity
appeased
the
hunchback
proved
himself
a
most
engaging
companion
and
as
the
carriage
lumbered
slowly
toward
pianura
he
had
time
not
only
to
recount
his
own
history
but
to
satisfy
odo
as
to
many
points
of
the
life
awaiting
him
gamba
it
appeared
owed
his
early
schooling
to
a
jesuit
priest
who
visiting
the
foundling
asylum
had
been
struck
by
the
child
quickness
and
had
taken
him
home
and
bred
him
to
be
a
clerk
the
priest
death
left
his
charge
adrift
with
a
smattering
of
scholarship
above
his
station
and
none
to
whom
he
could
turn
for
protection
for
a
while
he
had
lived
as
he
said
like
a
picking
up
a
meal
where
he
could
and
sleeping
in
church
porches
and
under
till
one
of
the
duke
servants
took
pity
on
him
and
he
was
suffered
to
hang
about
the
palace
and
earn
his
keep
by
doing
the
lacquey
errands
the
duke
attention
having
been
called
to
him
as
a
lad
of
parts
his
highness
had
given
him
to
the
marquess
of
cerveno
in
whose
service
he
remained
till
shortly
before
that
young
nobleman
death
the
hunchback
passed
hastily
over
this
period
but
his
reticence
was
lit
by
the
angry
flash
of
his
eyes
after
the
marquess
death
he
had
lived
for
a
while
from
hand
to
mouth
copying
music
writing
poetry
for
weddings
and
funerals
doing
portraits
at
a
scudo
apiece
and
putting
his
hand
to
any
honest
job
that
came
his
way
count
trescorre
who
now
and
then
showed
a
fitful
recognition
of
the
tie
that
was
supposed
to
connect
them
at
length
heard
of
the
case
to
which
he
was
come
and
offered
him
a
trifling
pension
this
the
hunchback
refused
asking
instead
to
be
given
some
fixed
employment
trescorre
then
obtained
his
appointment
as
assistant
to
the
duke
librarian
a
good
old
priest
engrossed
in
compiling
the
early
history
of
pianura
from
the
ducal
archives
and
this
post
gamba
had
now
filled
for
two
years
it
must
said
odo
be
one
singularly
congenial
to
you
if
as
i
have
heard
you
are
of
a
studious
habit
though
i
suppose
he
tentatively
added
the
library
is
not
likely
to
be
rich
in
works
of
the
new
scientific
and
philosophic
schools
his
companion
received
this
observation
in
silence
and
after
a
moment
odo
continued
i
have
a
motive
in
asking
since
i
have
been
somewhat
deeply
engaged
in
the
study
of
these
writers
and
my
dearest
wish
is
to
continue
while
in
pianura
my
examination
of
their
theories
and
if
possible
to
become
acquainted
with
any
who
share
their
views
he
was
not
insensible
of
the
risk
of
thus
opening
himself
to
a
stranger
but
the
sense
of
peril
made
him
the
more
eager
to
proclaim
himself
on
the
side
of
the
cause
he
seemed
to
have
deserted
gamba
turned
as
he
spoke
and
their
eyes
met
in
one
of
those
revealing
glances
that
lay
the
foundations
of
friendship
i
fear
cavaliere
said
the
hunchback
with
a
smile
that
you
will
find
both
branches
of
investigation
somewhat
difficult
to
pursue
in
pianura
for
the
church
takes
care
that
neither
the
philosophers
nor
their
books
shall
gain
a
footing
in
our
most
christian
state
indeed
he
added
not
only
must
the
library
be
free
from
heretical
works
but
the
librarian
clear
of
heretical
leanings
and
since
you
have
honoured
me
with
your
confidence
i
will
own
that
the
court
having
got
wind
of
my
supposed
tendency
to
liberalism
i
live
in
daily
expectation
of
dismissal
for
the
moment
they
are
content
to
keep
their
spies
on
me
but
were
it
not
for
the
protection
of
the
good
abate
my
superior
i
should
long
since
have
been
turned
out
and
why
asked
odo
do
you
speak
of
the
court
and
the
church
as
one
because
sir
in
our
virtuous
duchy
the
terms
are
interchangeable
the
duke
is
in
fact
so
zealous
a
son
of
the
church
that
if
the
latter
showed
any
leniency
to
sinners
the
secular
arm
would
promptly
repair
her
negligence
his
highness
as
you
may
have
heard
is
ruled
by
his
confessor
an
adroit
dominican
the
confessor
it
is
true
has
two
rivals
the
countess
belverde
a
lady
distinguished
for
her
piety
and
a
german
astrologer
or
alchemist
lately
come
to
pianura
and
calling
himself
a
descendant
of
the
egyptian
priesthood
and
an
adept
of
the
higher
or
secret
doctrines
of
neoplatonism
these
three
however
though
ostensibly
rivals
for
the
duke
favour
live
on
such
good
terms
with
one
another
that
they
are
suspected
of
having
entered
into
a
secret
partnership
while
some
regard
them
all
as
the
emissaries
of
the
jesuits
who
since
the
suppression
of
the
society
are
known
to
have
kept
a
footing
in
pianura
as
in
most
of
the
italian
states
as
to
the
duke
the
death
of
the
marquess
of
cerveno
the
failing
health
of
the
little
prince
and
his
own
strange
physical
infirmities
have
so
preyed
on
his
mind
that
he
is
the
victim
of
any
who
are
unscrupulous
enough
to
trade
on
the
fears
of
a
diseased
imagination
his
counsellors
however
divided
in
doctrine
have
at
least
one
end
in
common
and
that
is
to
keep
the
light
of
reason
out
of
the
darkened
chamber
in
which
they
have
confined
him
and
with
such
a
ruler
and
such
principles
of
government
you
may
fancy
that
poor
philosophy
has
not
where
to
lay
her
head
and
the
people
odo
pursued
what
of
the
fiscal
administration
in
some
states
where
liberty
of
thought
is
forbidden
the
material
welfare
of
the
subject
is
nevertheless
considered
the
hunchback
shook
his
head
it
may
be
so
said
he
though
i
had
thought
the
principle
of
moral
tyranny
must
infect
every
branch
of
public
administration
with
us
at
all
events
where
the
church
party
rules
the
privileges
and
exemptions
of
the
clergy
are
the
chief
source
of
suffering
and
the
state
of
passive
ignorance
in
which
they
have
kept
the
people
has
bred
in
the
latter
a
dull
resignation
that
is
the
surest
obstacle
to
reform
oh
sir
he
cried
his
eyes
darkening
with
emotion
if
you
could
see
as
i
do
the
blind
brute
misery
on
which
all
the
magnificence
of
rank
and
all
the
refinements
of
luxury
are
built
you
would
feel
as
you
drive
along
this
road
that
with
every
turn
of
the
wheels
you
are
passing
over
the
bodies
of
those
who
have
toiled
without
ceasing
that
you
might
ride
in
a
gilt
coach
and
have
gone
hungry
that
you
might
feast
in
kings
palaces
the
touch
of
rhetoric
in
this
adjuration
did
not
discredit
it
with
odo
to
whom
the
words
were
as
caustic
on
an
open
wound
he
turned
to
make
some
impulsive
answer
but
as
he
did
so
he
caught
sight
of
the
towers
of
pianura
rising
above
the
orchards
and
of
the
suburbs
the
sight
started
a
new
train
of
feeling
and
gamba
perceiving
it
said
quietly
but
this
is
no
time
to
speak
of
such
things
a
moment
later
the
carriage
had
passed
under
the
great
battlemented
gates
with
their
etruscan
and
the
motto
of
the
house
of
valsecca
humilitas
surmounted
by
the
ducal
escutcheon
though
the
hour
was
close
on
noon
the
streets
were
as
animated
as
at
the
angelus
and
the
carriage
could
hardly
proceed
for
the
crowd
obstructing
its
passage
so
unusual
at
that
period
was
such
a
sight
in
one
of
the
lesser
italian
cities
that
odo
turned
to
gamba
for
an
explanation
at
the
same
moment
a
roar
rose
from
the
crowd
and
the
coach
turning
into
the
corso
which
led
to
the
ducal
palace
and
the
centre
of
the
town
odo
caught
sight
of
a
strange
procession
advancing
from
that
direction
it
was
headed
by
a
clerk
or
usher
with
a
black
cap
and
staff
behind
whom
marched
two
friars
escorting
between
them
a
man
in
the
dress
of
an
abate
his
hands
bound
behind
him
and
his
head
surmounted
by
a
mitre
inscribed
with
the
title
a
destroyer
of
female
chastity
this
man
who
was
of
a
simple
and
decent
aspect
was
so
dazed
by
the
buffeting
of
the
crowd
so
spattered
by
the
mud
and
filth
hurled
at
him
from
a
hundred
taunting
hands
and
his
countenance
distorted
by
so
piteous
a
look
of
animal
fear
that
he
seemed
more
like
a
madman
being
haled
to
bedlam
than
a
penitent
making
public
amends
for
his
offence
are
such
failings
always
so
severely
punished
in
pianura
odo
asked
turning
ironically
to
gamba
as
the
mob
and
its
victim
passed
out
of
sight
the
hunchback
smiled
not
said
he
if
the
offender
be
in
a
position
to
benefit
by
the
admirable
doctrines
of
probabilism
the
direction
of
intention
or
any
one
of
the
numerous
expedients
by
which
an
indulgent
church
has
smoothed
the
way
of
the
sinner
but
as
god
does
not
give
the
crop
unless
man
sows
the
seed
so
his
ministers
bestow
grace
only
when
the
penitent
has
enriched
the
treasury
the
fellow
he
added
is
a
man
of
some
learning
and
of
a
retired
and
orderly
way
of
living
and
the
charge
was
brought
against
him
by
a
jeweller
and
his
wife
who
owed
him
a
sum
of
money
and
are
said
to
have
chosen
this
way
of
evading
payment
the
priests
are
always
glad
to
find
a
of
the
sort
especially
when
there
are
murmurs
against
the
private
conduct
of
those
in
high
places
and
the
woman
having
denounced
him
was
immediately
assured
by
her
confessor
that
any
debt
incurred
to
a
seducer
was
null
and
void
and
that
she
was
entitled
to
a
hundred
scudi
of
damages
for
having
been
led
into
sin
at
the
duke
express
wish
odo
was
to
lodge
in
the
palace
and
when
he
entered
the
courtyard
he
found
cantapresto
waiting
to
lead
him
to
his
apartment
the
rooms
assigned
to
him
lay
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
wings
overlooking
the
gardens
and
as
he
mounted
the
great
stairway
and
walked
down
the
corridors
with
their
frescoed
walls
and
busts
of
roman
emperors
he
recalled
the
night
when
he
had
passed
through
the
same
scenes
as
a
frightened
child
where
he
had
then
beheld
a
supernatural
fabric
peopled
with
divinities
of
bronze
and
marble
and
glowing
with
light
and
colour
he
now
saw
a
palace
stately
indeed
and
full
of
a
faded
splendour
but
dull
and
antiquated
in
comparison
with
the
elegance
of
the
sardinian
court
yet
at
every
turn
some
object
thrilled
the
fibres
of
old
association
or
pride
of
race
here
he
traversed
a
gallery
hung
with
the
portraits
of
his
line
there
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
pages
antechamber
through
which
he
and
his
mother
had
been
led
when
they
waited
on
the
duke
and
from
the
windows
of
his
closet
he
overlooked
the
alleys
and
terraces
where
he
had
wandered
with
the
hunchback
one
of
the
duke
pages
came
to
say
that
his
highness
would
receive
the
cavaliere
when
the
court
rose
from
dinner
and
finding
himself
with
two
hours
on
his
hands
odo
determined
to
await
his
kinsman
summons
in
the
garden
thither
he
presently
repaired
and
was
soon
with
a
mournful
pleasure
retracing
the
paths
he
had
first
explored
in
such
an
ecstasy
of
wonder
the
pleached
walks
and
parterres
were
in
all
the
freshness
of
june
roses
and
jasmine
mingled
on
the
ingeniously
grafted
with
red
and
white
carnations
stood
in
faenza
jars
before
the
and
marble
nymphs
and
fauns
peeped
from
thickets
of
flowering
camellias
a
noise
of
childish
voices
presently
attracted
odo
and
following
a
tunnel
of
clipped
limes
he
came
out
on
a
theatre
cut
in
the
turf
and
set
about
with
statues
of
apollo
and
the
muses
a
handful
of
boys
in
military
dress
were
performing
a
series
of
evolutions
in
the
centre
of
this
space
and
facing
them
stood
a
child
of
about
ten
years
in
a
colonel
uniform
covered
with
orders
his
hair
curled
and
powdered
a
sword
in
his
hand
and
his
frail
body
supported
on
one
side
by
a
turbaned
dwarf
and
on
the
other
by
an
ecclesiastic
who
was
evidently
his
governor
the
child
as
odo
approached
was
calling
out
his
orders
to
his
regiment
in
a
weak
shrill
voice
moving
now
here
now
there
on
his
booted
tottering
legs
as
his
two
supporters
guided
him
and
painfully
trying
to
flourish
the
paper
weapon
that
was
too
heavy
for
his
nerveless
wrist
behind
this
strange
group
stood
another
figure
that
of
a
tall
heavy
man
richly
dressed
with
a
curious
order
on
his
breast
and
a
veiled
somnolent
eye
which
he
kept
fixed
on
the
little
prince
odo
had
been
about
to
advance
and
do
homage
to
his
cousin
but
a
sign
from
the
man
in
the
background
arrested
him
the
manoeuvres
were
soon
over
the
heir
was
lifted
into
a
little
gilded
chariot
drawn
by
white
goats
his
regiment
formed
in
line
and
saluted
him
and
he
disappeared
down
one
of
the
alleys
with
his
attendants
this
ceremony
over
the
tall
man
advanced
to
odo
with
a
bow
and
asked
pardon
for
the
liberty
he
had
taken
you
are
doubtless
said
he
his
highness
cousin
the
cavaliere
valsecca
and
my
excuse
for
intruding
between
yourself
and
the
prince
is
that
i
am
the
duke
physician
count
heiligenstern
and
that
the
heir
is
at
present
undergoing
a
course
of
treatment
under
my
care
his
health
as
you
probably
know
has
long
been
a
cause
of
anxiety
to
his
illustrious
parents
and
when
i
was
summoned
to
pianura
the
college
of
physicians
had
given
up
all
hope
of
saving
him
since
my
coming
however
i
flatter
myself
that
a
marked
change
is
perceptible
my
method
is
that
of
invigorating
the
blood
by
exciting
the
passions
most
likely
to
produce
a
generous
vital
ardour
thus
by
organising
these
juvenile
manoeuvres
i
arouse
the
prince
martial
zeal
by
encouraging
him
to
study
the
history
of
his
ancestors
i
evoke
his
political
ambition
by
causing
him
to
be
led
about
the
gardens
on
a
pony
accompanied
by
a
miniature
pack
of
maltese
dogs
in
pursuit
of
a
tame
doe
i
stimulate
the
passion
of
the
chase
but
it
is
essential
to
my
system
that
one
emotion
should
not
violently
counteract
another
and
i
am
therefore
obliged
to
protect
my
noble
patient
from
the
sudden
intrusion
of
new
impressions
this
explanation
delivered
in
a
sententious
tone
and
with
a
strong
german
accent
seemed
to
odo
no
more
than
a
learned
travesty
of
the
familiar
and
pathetic
expedient
of
distracting
a
sick
child
by
the
pretence
of
manly
diversions
he
was
struck
however
by
the
aspect
and
would
have
engaged
him
in
talk
had
not
one
of
the
gentlemen
appeared
with
the
announcement
that
his
highness
would
be
pleased
to
receive
the
cavaliere
valsecca
like
most
dwellings
of
its
kind
in
italy
the
palace
of
pianura
resembled
one
of
those
shells
which
reveal
by
their
outer
convolutions
the
gradual
development
of
the
creature
housed
within
for
two
or
three
generations
after
bracciaforte
the
terrible
founder
of
the
line
had
made
himself
master
of
the
republic
his
descendants
had
clung
to
the
old
brick
fortress
or
rocca
which
the
great
condottiere
had
held
successfully
against
the
burghers
arquebuses
and
the
of
rival
adventurers
and
which
still
glassed
its
battlements
in
the
slow
waters
of
the
piana
beside
the
city
wall
it
was
ascanio
the
first
duke
the
correspondent
of
politian
and
castiglione
who
finding
the
ancestral
lair
too
cramped
for
the
court
of
a
humanist
prince
had
summoned
luciano
da
laurana
to
build
a
palace
better
fitted
to
his
state
duke
ascanio
in
bronze
by
verocchio
still
looked
up
with
pride
from
the
at
the
brick
and
facade
with
its
arches
crowned
by
imperial
profiles
but
a
later
prince
found
the
small
rooms
and
intricate
passages
of
laurana
structure
inadequate
to
the
pomp
of
an
ally
of
leo
and
vignola
added
the
state
apartments
the
sculpture
gallery
and
the
libraries
the
palace
now
passed
for
one
of
the
wonders
of
italy
the
duke
guest
the
witty
and
learned
aretino
celebrated
it
in
verse
his
friend
cardinal
bembo
in
prose
correggio
painted
the
walls
of
one
room
guilio
romano
the
ceiling
of
another
it
seemed
that
magnificence
could
go
no
farther
till
the
seventeenth
century
brought
to
the
throne
a
duke
who
asked
himself
how
a
prince
could
live
without
a
theatre
a
and
an
additional
wing
to
lodge
the
train
of
court
officials
who
had
by
this
time
replaced
the
feudal
he
answered
the
question
by
laying
an
extra
tax
on
his
people
and
inviting
to
pianura
the
great
roman
architect
carlo
borromini
who
regretfully
admitted
that
his
illustrious
patron
was
on
the
whole
less
royally
housed
than
their
highnesses
of
mantua
and
parma
within
five
years
the
cavallerizza
the
theatre
and
the
gardens
flung
defiance
at
these
aspiring
potentates
and
again
pianura
took
precedence
of
her
rivals
the
present
duke
father
had
expressed
the
most
recent
tendency
of
the
race
by
the
erection
of
a
chapel
in
the
florid
jesuit
style
and
the
group
of
buildings
thus
chronicled
in
rich
durable
lines
the
varying
passions
and
ambitions
of
three
hundred
years
of
power
as
odo
followed
his
guide
toward
the
duke
apartments
he
remarked
a
change
in
the
aspect
of
the
palace
where
formerly
the
corridors
had
been
thronged
with
pages
lacqueys
and
cavaliers
and
ladies
only
a
few
ecclesiastics
now
glided
by
here
a
monsignore
in
ermine
and
lace
rochet
attended
by
his
chaplain
and
secretaries
there
a
cowled
dominican
or
a
secular
priest
the
duke
was
lodged
in
the
oldest
portion
of
the
palace
and
odo
who
had
never
visited
these
apartments
looked
with
interest
at
the
projecting
sculptured
chimney
and
vaulted
ceiling
of
the
pages
which
had
formerly
been
the
guardroom
and
was
still
hung
with
panoplies
thence
he
was
led
into
a
gallery
lined
with
scriptural
tapestries
and
furnished
in
the
heavy
style
of
the
seventeenth
century
here
he
waited
a
few
moments
hearing
the
sound
of
conversation
in
the
room
beyond
then
the
door
of
this
apartment
opened
and
a
handsome
dominican
passed
out
followed
by
a
page
who
invited
odo
to
step
into
the
duke
cabinet
this
was
a
very
small
room
completely
panelled
in
delicate
touched
with
gold
over
this
panelling
regardless
of
the
beauty
of
its
design
had
been
hung
a
mass
of
reliquaries
and
small
devotional
and
paintings
making
the
room
appear
more
like
the
chapel
of
a
saint
than
a
prince
closet
here
again
odo
found
himself
alone
but
the
page
presently
returned
to
say
that
his
highness
was
not
well
and
begged
the
cavaliere
to
wait
on
him
in
his
the
most
conspicuous
object
in
this
room
was
a
great
bedstead
raised
on
a
dais
the
plumed
posts
and
sumptuous
hangings
of
the
bed
gave
it
an
air
and
the
duke
himself
who
lay
between
the
curtains
his
wig
replaced
by
a
nightcap
a
scapular
about
his
neck
and
his
shrivelled
body
wrapped
in
a
brocaded
looked
more
like
a
relic
than
a
man
his
heavy
trembled
slightly
as
he
offered
his
hand
to
odo
salute
you
find
me
cousin
said
he
after
a
brief
greeting
much
troubled
by
a
question
that
has
of
late
incessantly
disturbed
my
rest
can
the
soul
after
full
intuition
of
god
be
polluted
by
the
sins
of
the
body
he
clutched
odo
hand
in
his
burning
grasp
is
it
possible
that
there
are
human
beings
so
heedless
of
their
doom
that
they
can
go
about
their
earthly
pleasures
with
this
awful
problem
unsolved
oh
why
has
not
some
pope
decided
it
why
has
god
left
this
hideous
uncertainty
hanging
over
us
you
know
the
doctrine
of
plotinus
who
has
access
to
god
leaves
the
virtues
behind
him
as
the
images
of
the
gods
are
left
in
the
outer
temple
many
of
the
fathers
believed
that
the
neoplatonists
were
permitted
to
foreshadow
in
their
teachings
the
revelation
of
christ
but
on
these
occult
points
much
doubt
remains
and
though
certain
of
the
great
theologians
have
inclined
to
this
interpretation
there
are
others
who
hold
that
it
leans
to
the
heresy
of
quietism
odo
who
had
inferred
in
the
duke
opening
words
an
allusion
to
the
little
prince
or
to
some
political
anxiety
was
at
a
loss
how
to
reply
to
this
strange
appeal
but
after
a
moment
he
said
i
have
heard
that
your
highness
director
is
a
man
of
great
learning
and
discrimination
can
he
not
help
your
highness
to
some
decision
on
this
point
the
duke
glanced
at
him
suspiciously
father
ignazio
said
he
is
in
fact
in
theology
but
there
are
certain
doctrines
inaccessible
to
all
but
a
few
who
have
received
the
direct
illumination
of
heaven
and
on
this
point
i
can
not
feel
that
his
judgment
is
final
he
wiped
the
dampness
from
his
sallow
forehead
and
pressed
the
scapular
to
his
lips
may
you
never
know
he
cried
the
agony
of
a
father
whose
child
is
dying
of
a
sovereign
who
longs
to
labour
for
the
welfare
of
his
people
but
who
is
racked
by
the
thought
that
in
giving
his
mind
to
temporal
duties
and
domestic
affections
while
such
spiritual
difficulties
are
still
unsolved
he
may
be
preparing
for
himself
an
eternity
of
torture
such
as
that
and
he
pointed
to
an
old
and
blackened
picture
of
the
last
judgment
that
hung
on
the
opposite
wall
odo
tried
to
frame
a
soothing
rejoinder
but
the
duke
passionately
interrupted
him
alas
cousin
no
rest
is
possible
for
one
who
has
attained
the
rapture
of
the
beatific
vision
yet
who
trembles
lest
the
mere
mechanical
indulgence
of
the
senses
may
still
subject
him
to
the
common
penalty
of
sin
as
a
man
who
has
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
theology
is
privileged
to
argue
on
questions
forbidden
to
the
vulgar
so
surely
fasting
maceration
and
ecstasy
must
liberate
the
body
from
the
bondage
of
prescribed
morality
shall
no
distinction
be
recognised
between
my
conduct
and
that
of
the
common
sot
or
debauchee
whose
soul
lies
in
blind
subjection
to
his
lower
instincts
i
who
have
laboured
early
and
late
to
remove
temptation
from
my
people
who
have
punished
offences
against
conduct
as
unsparingly
as
spiritual
error
i
who
have
not
scrupled
to
destroy
every
picture
in
my
galleries
that
contained
a
nude
figure
or
a
wanton
attitude
i
who
have
been
blessed
from
childhood
by
tokens
of
divine
favour
and
miraculous
intervention
can
i
doubt
that
i
have
earned
the
privileges
of
that
higher
state
in
which
the
soul
is
no
longer
responsible
for
the
failings
of
the
body
and
yet
and
yet
what
if
i
were
mistaken
he
moaned
what
if
my
advisors
have
deceived
me
si
autem
et
sic
impius
sum
quare
frustra
laboravi
and
he
sank
back
on
his
pillows
limp
as
an
empty
glove
alarmed
at
his
disorder
odo
stood
irresolute
whether
to
call
for
help
but
as
he
hesitated
the
duke
feebly
drew
from
his
bosom
a
gold
key
attached
to
a
slender
venetian
chain
this
said
he
unlocks
the
small
cabinet
yonder
in
it
you
will
find
a
phial
of
clear
liquor
a
few
drops
of
which
will
restore
me
is
an
essence
distilled
by
the
benedictine
nuns
of
the
perpetual
adoration
and
peculiarly
effective
in
accesses
of
spiritual
disturbance
odo
complied
and
having
poured
the
liquor
into
a
glass
held
it
to
his
cousin
lips
in
a
moment
the
duke
eye
revived
and
he
began
to
speak
in
a
weak
but
composed
voice
with
an
air
of
dignity
in
singular
contrast
to
his
previous
i
am
said
he
unhappily
subject
to
such
seizures
after
any
prolonged
exertion
and
a
conversation
i
have
just
had
with
my
director
has
left
me
in
no
fit
state
to
receive
you
the
cares
of
government
sit
heavy
on
one
who
has
scarce
health
enough
for
the
duties
of
a
private
station
and
were
it
not
for
my
son
i
should
long
since
have
withdrawn
to
the
shelter
of
the
monastic
life
he
paused
and
looked
at
odo
with
a
melancholy
kindness
in
you
said
he
the
native
weakness
of
our
complexion
appears
to
have
been
tempered
by
the
blood
of
your
mother
house
and
your
countenance
gives
every
promise
of
health
and
vivacity
he
broke
off
with
a
sigh
and
continued
in
a
more
authoritative
tone
you
have
learned
from
count
trescorre
my
motive
in
summoning
you
to
pianura
my
son
health
causes
me
the
liveliest
concern
my
own
is
subject
to
such
seizures
as
you
have
just
witnessed
i
can
not
think
that
in
this
age
of
infidelity
and
disorder
god
can
design
to
deprive
a
christian
state
of
a
line
of
sovereigns
uniformly
zealous
in
the
defence
of
truth
but
the
purposes
of
heaven
are
inscrutable
as
the
recent
suppression
of
the
society
of
jesus
has
most
strangely
proved
and
should
our
dynasty
be
extinguished
i
am
consoled
by
the
thought
that
the
rule
will
pass
to
one
of
our
house
of
this
i
shall
have
more
to
say
to
you
in
future
meanwhile
your
first
business
is
to
acquaint
yourself
with
your
new
surroundings
the
duchess
holds
a
circle
this
evening
where
you
will
meet
the
court
but
i
must
advise
you
that
the
persons
her
highness
favours
with
her
intimacy
are
not
those
best
qualified
to
guide
and
instruct
a
young
man
in
your
position
these
you
will
meet
at
the
house
of
the
countess
belverde
one
of
the
duchess
ladies
a
woman
of
sound
judgment
and
scrupulous
piety
who
gathers
about
her
all
our
most
learned
and
saintly
ecclesiastics
count
trescorre
will
instruct
you
in
all
that
becomes
your
position
at
court
and
my
director
father
ignazio
will
aid
you
in
the
selection
of
a
confessor
as
to
the
bishop
a
most
worthy
and
conversable
prelate
to
whom
i
would
have
you
show
all
due
regard
his
zeal
in
spiritual
matters
is
not
as
great
as
i
could
wish
and
in
private
talk
he
indulges
in
a
laxity
of
opinion
against
which
i
can
not
too
emphatically
warn
you
happily
however
pianura
offers
other
opportunities
of
edification
father
ignazio
is
a
man
of
wide
learning
and
inflexible
doctrine
and
in
several
of
our
monasteries
notably
that
of
the
barnabites
you
will
find
examples
of
sanctity
and
wisdom
such
as
a
young
man
may
well
devoutly
consider
our
convents
also
are
distinguished
for
the
severity
of
their
rule
and
the
spiritual
privileges
accorded
them
the
carmelites
have
every
reason
to
hope
for
the
beatification
of
their
aged
prioress
and
among
the
nuns
of
the
perpetual
adoration
is
one
who
has
recently
received
the
ineffable
grace
of
the
vulnus
divinum
in
the
conversation
of
these
saintly
nuns
and
of
the
holy
abbot
of
the
barnabites
you
will
find
the
surest
safeguard
against
those
errors
and
temptations
that
beset
your
age
he
leaned
back
with
a
gesture
of
dismissal
but
added
reddening
slightly
as
odo
prepared
to
withdraw
you
will
oblige
me
cousin
when
you
meet
my
physician
count
heiligenstern
by
not
touching
on
the
matter
of
the
restorative
you
have
seen
me
take
odo
left
his
cousin
presence
with
a
feeling
of
deep
discouragement
to
a
spirit
aware
of
the
new
influences
abroad
and
fresh
from
contact
with
evils
rooted
in
the
very
foundations
of
the
existing
system
there
was
a
peculiar
irony
in
being
advised
to
seek
guidance
and
instruction
in
the
society
of
ecstatic
nuns
and
cloistered
theologians
the
duke
with
his
sickly
soul
agrope
in
a
maze
of
neoplatonism
and
probabilism
while
his
people
groaned
under
unjust
taxes
while
knowledge
and
intellectual
liberty
languished
in
a
kind
of
moral
seemed
to
odo
like
a
ruler
who
in
time
of
famine
should
keep
the
royal
granaries
locked
and
spend
his
days
praying
for
the
succour
that
his
own
hand
might
have
dispensed
in
the
tapestry
room
one
of
his
highness
gentlemen
waited
to
reconduct
odo
their
way
lay
through
the
portrait
gallery
of
which
he
had
previously
caught
a
glimpse
and
here
he
begged
his
guide
to
leave
him
he
felt
a
sudden
desire
to
meet
his
unknown
ancestors
face
to
face
and
to
trace
the
tendencies
which
from
the
grim
bracciaforte
and
the
stately
sceptical
humanist
of
leo
age
had
mysteriously
forced
the
race
into
its
mould
the
dusky
canvases
hung
high
in
tarnished
escutcheoned
frames
presented
a
continuous
chronicle
of
the
line
from
bracciaforte
himself
with
his
predatory
profile
outlined
by
some
early
tuscan
hand
against
the
turrets
of
his
impregnable
fortress
odo
lingered
long
on
this
image
but
it
was
not
till
he
stood
beneath
piero
della
francesca
portrait
of
the
first
duke
that
he
felt
the
thrill
of
kindred
instincts
in
this
grave
face
with
its
sensuous
mouth
and
melancholy
speculative
eyes
he
recognised
the
mingled
strain
of
impressionability
and
unrest
that
had
reached
such
diverse
issues
in
his
cousin
and
himself
the
great
duke
of
the
golden
age
in
his
titianesque
brocade
the
statuette
of
a
naked
faun
at
his
elbow
and
a
smile
on
his
own
ruddy
lips
represented
another
aspect
of
the
ancestral
spirit
the
rounded
temperament
of
an
age
of
cyrenaicism
in
which
every
moment
was
a
ripe
fruit
sunned
on
all
sides
a
little
farther
on
the
shadow
of
the
council
of
trent
began
to
fall
on
the
ducal
faces
as
the
uniform
blackness
of
the
spanish
habit
replaced
the
sumptuous
colours
of
the
renaissance
here
was
the
persecuting
bishop
paul
iv
ally
against
the
spaniards
painted
by
caravaggio
in
hauberk
and
mailed
gloves
with
his
motto
etiam
cum
gladio
surmounting
the
episcopal
chair
there
the
duke
who
after
a
life
of
hard
warfare
and
stern
piety
had
resigned
his
office
to
his
son
and
died
in
the
angelica
vestis
of
the
tertiary
order
and
the
beatified
duchess
who
had
sold
her
jewels
to
buy
corn
for
the
poor
during
the
famine
of
and
had
worn
a
under
a
corset
that
seemed
stiff
enough
to
serve
all
the
purposes
of
bodily
mortification
so
the
file
descended
the
colours
fading
the
shadows
deepening
till
it
reached
a
baby
porporato
of
the
last
century
who
had
donned
the
cardinal
habit
at
four
and
stood
rigid
and
a
little
pale
in
his
red
robes
and
lace
with
a
crucifix
and
a
skull
on
the
table
to
which
the
top
of
his
berretta
hardly
reached
it
seemed
to
odo
as
he
gazed
on
the
long
line
of
faces
as
though
their
owners
had
entered
one
by
one
into
a
narrowing
defile
where
the
sun
rose
later
and
set
earlier
on
each
successive
traveller
and
in
every
countenance
from
that
of
the
first
duke
to
that
of
his
own
peruked
and
cuirassed
grandfather
he
discerned
the
same
symptom
of
decadency
that
duality
of
will
which
in
a
race
is
the
fatal
fruit
of
an
undisturbed
they
had
ruled
too
long
and
enjoyed
too
much
and
the
poor
creature
he
had
just
left
to
his
dismal
scruples
and
forebodings
seemed
the
mere
empty
husk
of
passions
the
duchess
was
lodged
in
the
borromini
wing
of
the
palace
and
thither
odo
was
conducted
that
evening
to
eyes
accustomed
to
such
ceremonial
there
was
no
great
novelty
in
the
troop
of
powdered
servants
the
in
his
short
cloak
and
chain
and
the
florid
splendour
of
the
long
suite
of
rooms
decorated
in
a
style
that
already
appeared
to
the
more
fastidious
taste
of
the
day
odo
curiosity
centred
chiefly
in
the
persons
peopling
this
scene
whose
conflicting
interests
and
passions
formed
as
it
were
the
framework
of
the
social
structure
of
pianura
so
that
there
was
not
a
labourer
in
the
or
a
weaver
in
the
but
depended
for
his
crust
of
black
bread
and
the
leaking
roof
over
his
head
on
the
private
whim
of
some
member
of
that
brilliant
company
the
duchess
who
soon
entered
received
odo
with
the
flighty
of
a
roving
mind
but
as
her
gaze
met
his
her
colour
rose
her
eyes
lingered
on
his
face
and
she
invited
him
to
a
seat
at
her
side
maria
clementina
was
of
austrian
descent
and
something
in
her
free
and
noble
port
and
the
smiling
arrogance
of
her
manner
recalled
the
aspect
of
her
distant
kinswoman
the
young
queen
of
france
she
plied
odo
with
a
hundred
questions
interrupting
his
answers
with
a
playful
abruptness
and
to
all
appearances
more
engaged
by
his
person
than
his
discourse
have
you
seen
my
son
she
asked
i
remember
you
a
little
boy
scarce
bigger
than
ferrante
whom
your
mother
brought
to
kiss
my
hand
in
the
very
year
of
my
marriage
yes
and
you
pinched
my
toy
spaniel
sir
and
i
was
so
angry
with
you
that
i
got
up
and
turned
my
back
on
the
company
do
you
remember
but
how
should
you
being
such
a
child
at
the
time
ah
cousin
how
old
you
make
me
feel
i
would
to
god
my
son
looked
as
you
did
then
but
the
duke
is
killing
him
with
his
nostrums
the
child
was
healthy
enough
when
he
was
born
but
what
with
novenas
and
touching
of
relics
and
animal
magnetism
and
electrical
treatment
there
not
a
bone
in
his
little
body
but
the
saints
and
the
surgeons
are
fighting
over
its
possession
have
you
read
cousin
by
the
new
french
author
i
forget
his
name
well
i
would
have
the
child
brought
up
like
allowed
to
run
wild
in
the
country
and
grow
up
sturdy
and
hard
as
a
little
peasant
but
what
heresies
am
i
talking
the
book
is
on
the
index
i
believe
and
if
my
director
knew
i
had
it
in
my
library
i
should
be
set
up
in
the
stocks
in
the
and
all
my
burnt
at
the
church
door
as
a
warning
against
the
danger
of
importing
the
new
fashions
from
france
i
hope
you
hunt
cousin
she
cried
suddenly
is
my
chief
diversion
and
one
i
would
have
my
friends
enjoy
with
me
his
highness
has
lately
seen
fit
to
cut
down
my
stables
so
that
i
have
scarce
forty
to
my
name
and
the
greater
part
but
sorry
nags
at
that
yet
i
can
still
find
a
mount
for
any
friend
that
will
ride
with
me
and
i
hope
to
see
you
among
the
number
if
the
duke
can
spare
you
now
and
then
from
mass
and
benediction
his
highness
complains
that
i
am
always
surrounded
by
the
same
company
but
is
it
my
fault
if
there
are
not
twenty
persons
at
court
that
can
survive
a
day
in
the
saddle
and
a
night
at
cards
have
you
seen
the
belverde
my
mistress
of
the
robes
she
follows
the
hunt

her
beads
at
the
death
i
hope
you
like
cards
too
cousin
for
i
would
have
all
my
weaknesses
shared
by
my
friends
that
they
may
be
the
less
disposed
to
criticise
them
the
impression
produced
on
the
duchess
by
the
cavaliere
valsecca
was
closely
observed
by
several
members
of
the
group
surrounding
her
highness
one
of
these
was
count
trescorre
who
moved
among
the
courtiers
with
an
air
of
ease
that
seemed
to
establish
without
proclaiming
the
tie
between
himself
and
the
duchess
when
maria
clementina
sat
down
at
play
trescorre
joined
odo
and
with
his
usual
friendliness
pointed
out
the
most
conspicuous
figures
in
the
circle
the
duchess
society
as
the
duke
had
implied
was
composed
of
the
livelier
members
of
the
court
chief
among
whom
was
the
same
don
serafino
who
had
figured
so
vividly
in
the
reminiscences
of
mirandolina
and
cantapresto
this
gentleman
a
notorious
and
gamester
with
some
remains
of
good
looks
and
a
gay
boisterous
manner
played
the
leader
of
revels
to
her
highness
following
and
at
his
heels
came
the
flock
of
pretty
women
and
dashing
spendthrifts
who
compose
the
train
of
a
young
and
princess
on
such
occasions
as
the
present
however
all
the
members
of
the
court
were
obliged
to
pay
their
duty
to
her
highness
and
conspicuous
among
these
less
frequent
visitors
was
the
director
the
suave
and
handsome
dominican
whom
odo
had
seen
leaving
his
highness
closet
that
afternoon
this
ecclesiastic
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
the
prime
minister
count
pievepelago
a
small
feeble
mannikin
covered
with
gold
lace
and
orders
the
deference
with
which
the
latter
followed
the
dominican
discourse
excited
odo
attention
but
it
was
soon
diverted
by
the
approach
of
a
lady
who
joined
herself
to
the
group
with
an
air
of
discreet
familiarity
though
no
longer
young
she
was
still
slender
and
graceful
and
her
languid
eye
and
vapourish
manner
seemed
to
odo
to
veil
an
uncommon
alertness
of
perception
the
rich
sobriety
of
her
dress
the
jewelled
rosary
about
her
wrist
and
most
of
all
perhaps
the
murderous
sweetness
of
the
smile
with
which
the
duchess
addressed
her
told
him
that
here
was
the
countess
belverde
an
inference
which
trescorre
confirmed
the
countess
said
he
or
i
should
rather
say
the
marchioness
of
boscofolto
since
the
duke
has
just
bestowed
on
her
the
fief
of
that
name
is
impatient
to
make
your
acquaintance
and
since
you
doubtless
remember
the
saying
of
the
marquis
de
montesquieu
that
to
know
a
ruler
one
must
know
his
confessor
and
his
mistress
you
will
perhaps
be
glad
to
seize
both
opportunities
in
one
the
countess
greeted
odo
with
a
flattering
deference
and
at
once
drew
him
into
conversation
with
pievepelago
and
the
dominican
we
are
discussing
said
she
the
details
of
prince
approaching
visit
to
the
shrine
of
our
lady
of
the
mountain
this
shrine
lies
about
half
an
hour
ride
beyond
my
villa
of
boscofolto
where
i
hope
to
have
the
honour
of
receiving
their
highnesses
on
their
return
from
the
pilgrimage
the
madonna
del
monte
as
you
doubtless
know
has
often
preserved
the
ducal
house
in
seasons
of
peril
notably
during
the
great
plague
of
and
during
the
famine
in
the
duchess
time
when
her
highness
of
blessed
memory
met
our
lady
in
the
streets
distributing
bread
in
the
dress
of
a
from
the
hills
but
with
a
necklace
made
of
instead
of
garnets
father
ignazio
has
lately
counselled
the
little
prince
visiting
in
state
the
protectress
of
his
line
and
his
highness
physician
count
heiligenstern
does
not
disapprove
the
plan
in
fact
she
added
i
understand
that
he
thinks
all
special
acts
of
piety
beneficial
as
symbolising
the
inward
act
by
which
the
soul
incessantly
strives
to
reunite
itself
to
the
one
the
dominican
glanced
at
odo
with
a
smile
the
count
dialectics
said
he
might
be
dangerous
were
they
a
little
clearer
but
we
must
hope
he
distinguishes
more
accurately
between
his
drugs
than
his
dogmas
but
i
am
told
the
prime
minister
here
interposed
in
a
creaking
rusty
voice
that
her
highness
is
set
against
the
pilgrimage
and
will
put
every
obstacle
in
the
way
of
its
being
performed
the
countess
sighed
and
cast
down
her
eyes
the
dominican
remained
silent
and
trescorre
said
quietly
to
odo
her
highness
would
be
pleased
to
have
you
join
her
in
a
game
at
basset
as
they
crossed
the
room
he
added
in
a
low
tone
the
duchess
in
spite
of
her
remarkable
strength
of
character
is
still
of
an
age
to
be
readily
open
to
new
influences
i
observed
she
was
much
taken
by
your
conversation
and
you
would
be
doing
her
a
service
by
engaging
her
not
to
oppose
this
pilgrimage
to
boscofolto
we
have
heiligenstern
word
that
it
can
not
harm
the
prince
it
will
produce
a
good
impression
on
the
people
and
it
is
of
vital
importance
to
her
highness
not
to
side
against
the
duke
in
such
matters
and
he
withdrew
with
a
smile
as
odo
approached
the
odo
left
the
duchess
circle
with
an
increased
desire
to
penetrate
more
deeply
into
the
organisation
of
the
little
world
about
him
to
trace
the
operation
of
its
various
parts
and
to
put
his
hand
on
the
mainspring
about
which
they
revolved
and
he
wondered
whether
gamba
whose
connection
with
the
ducal
library
must
give
him
some
insight
into
the
affairs
of
the
court
might
not
prove
as
instructive
a
guide
through
this
labyrinth
as
through
the
mazes
of
the
ducal
garden
the
duke
library
filled
a
series
of
rooms
designed
in
the
classical
style
of
the
on
the
very
threshold
odo
was
conscious
of
leaving
behind
the
trivial
activities
of
the
palace
with
the
fantastic
architecture
which
seemed
their
natural
setting
here
all
was
based
on
a
noble
permanence
of
taste
a
convergence
of
accumulated
effort
toward
a
chosen
end
and
the
door
was
fittingly
surmounted
by
seneca
definition
of
the
wise
man
state
omnia
illi
secula
ut
deo
serviunt
odo
would
gladly
have
lingered
among
the
books
which
filled
the
rooms
with
an
aroma
of
old
leather
his
imagination
caressed
in
passing
the
yellowish
vellum
backs
the
worn
tooling
of
aldine
folios
the
heavy
silver
clasps
of
ancient
chronicles
and
psalters
but
his
first
object
was
to
find
gamba
and
renew
the
conversation
of
the
previous
day
in
this
he
was
disappointed
the
only
occupant
of
the
library
was
the
hunchback
friend
and
protector
the
abate
crescenti
a
tall
priest
with
the
roseate
gravity
and
benevolent
air
of
a
donator
in
some
flemish
triptych
the
abate
courteously
welcoming
odo
explained
that
he
had
despatched
his
assistant
to
the
benedictine
monastery
to
copy
certain
ancient
records
of
transactions
between
that
order
and
the
lords
of
valsecca
and
added
that
gamba
on
his
return
should
at
once
be
apprised
of
the
cavaliere
wish
to
see
him
the
abate
himself
had
been
engaged
when
his
visitor
entered
in
collating
manuscripts
but
on
odo
begging
him
to
return
to
his
work
he
said
with
a
smile
i
do
not
suffer
from
an
excess
of
interruptions
for
the
library
is
the
least
visited
portion
of
the
palace
and
i
am
glad
to
welcome
any
who
are
disposed
to
inspect
its
treasures
i
know
not
cavaliere
he
added
if
the
report
of
my
humble
labours
has
ever
reached
you
and
on
odo
affirmative
gesture
he
went
on
with
the
eagerness
of
a
shy
man
who
gathers
assurance
from
the
intelligence
of
his
listener
such
researches
into
the
rude
and
uncivilised
past
seem
to
me
as
essential
to
the
comprehension
of
the
present
as
the
mastering
of
the
major
premiss
to
the
understanding
of
a
syllogism
and
to
those
who
reproach
me
for
wasting
my
life
over
the
chronicles
of
barbarian
invasions
and
the
records
of
monkish
litigations
instead
of
contemplating
the
illustrious
deeds
of
greek
sages
and
roman
heroes
i
confidently
reply
that
it
is
more
useful
to
a
man
to
know
his
own
father
character
than
that
of
a
remote
ancestor
even
in
this
quiet
retreat
he
went
on
i
hear
much
talk
of
abuses
and
of
the
need
for
reform
and
i
often
think
that
if
they
who
rail
so
loudly
against
existing
institutions
would
take
the
trouble
to
trace
them
to
their
source
and
would
for
instance
compare
this
state
as
it
is
today
with
its
condition
five
hundred
or
a
thousand
years
ago
instead
of
measuring
it
by
the
standard
of
some
imaginary
platonic
republic
they
would
find
if
not
less
subject
for
complaint
yet
fuller
means
of
understanding
and
remedying
the
abuses
they
discover
this
view
of
history
was
one
so
new
in
the
abate
crescenti
day
that
it
surprised
odo
with
the
revelation
of
unsuspected
possibilities
how
was
it
that
among
the
philosophers
whose
works
he
had
studied
none
had
thought
of
tracing
in
the
social
and
political
tendencies
of
the
race
the
germ
of
wrongs
so
confidently
ascribed
to
the
cunning
of
priests
and
the
rapacity
of
princes
odo
listened
with
growing
interest
while
crescenti
encouraged
by
his
questions
pointed
out
how
the
abuses
of
feudalism
had
arisen
from
the
small
need
of
protection
against
the
northern
invader
as
the
concentration
of
royal
prerogative
had
been
the
outcome
of
the
king
intervention
between
his
great
vassals
and
the
communes
the
discouragement
which
had
obscured
outlook
since
his
visit
to
pontesordo
was
cleared
away
by
the
discovery
that
in
a
sympathetic
study
of
the
past
might
lie
the
secret
of
dealing
with
present
evils
his
imagination
taking
the
intervening
obstacles
at
a
bound
arrived
at
once
at
the
general
axiom
to
which
such
inductions
pointed
and
if
he
afterward
learned
that
human
development
follows
no
such
direct
line
of
advance
but
must
painfully
stumble
across
the
wastes
of
error
prejudice
and
ignorance
while
the
theoriser
traverses
the
same
distance
with
a
stroke
of
his
speculative
pinions
yet
the
influence
of
these
teachings
tempered
his
judgments
with
charity
and
dignified
his
very
failures
by
a
tragic
sense
of
their
inevitableness
crescenti
suggested
that
gamba
should
wait
on
odo
that
evening
but
the
latter
being
uncertain
how
far
he
might
dispose
of
his
time
enquired
where
the
hunchback
lodged
with
a
view
of
sending
for
him
at
a
convenient
moment
having
dined
at
the
duchess
table
and
soon
wearying
of
the
vapid
company
of
her
associates
he
yielded
to
the
desire
for
contrast
that
so
often
guided
his
course
and
set
out
toward
sunset
in
search
of
gamba
lodging
it
was
his
first
opportunity
of
inspecting
the
town
at
leisure
and
for
a
while
he
let
his
curiosity
lead
him
as
it
would
the
streets
near
the
palace
were
full
of
noble
residences
recording
in
their
sculptured
doorways
in
the
work
of
and
and
in
every
architectural
detail
the
gradual
change
of
taste
that
had
transformed
the
machicolations
of
the
mediaeval
fighter
into
the
open
cortiles
and
airy
balconies
of
his
descendant
here
and
there
amid
these
inveterate
records
of
dominion
rose
the
monuments
of
a
mightier
and
more
ancient
power
of
these
churches
and
monasteries
the
greater
number
dating
only
from
the
ascendancy
of
the
valseccas
showed
an
ordered
and
sumptuous
architecture
but
one
or
two
buildings
surviving
from
the
period
of
the
free
city
stood
out
among
them
with
the
austerity
of
desert
saints
in
a
throng
of
court
ecclesiastics
the
columns
of
the
cathedral
porch
were
still
supported
on
featureless
porphyry
lions
worn
smooth
by
generations
of
loungers
and
above
the
octagonal
baptistery
ran
a
fantastic
basrelief
wherein
the
spirals
of
the
vine
framed
an
allegory
of
men
and
monsters
symbolising
in
their
mysterious
conflicts
the
manicheism
of
the
middle
ages
fresh
from
his
talk
with
crescenti
odo
lingered
curiously
on
these
sculptures
which
but
the
day
before
he
might
have
passed
by
as
the
efforts
of
ignorant
workmen
but
which
now
seemed
full
of
the
significance
that
belongs
to
any
incomplete
expression
of
human
thought
or
feeling
of
their
relation
to
the
growth
of
art
he
had
as
yet
no
clear
notion
but
as
evidence
of
sensations
that
his
forefathers
had
struggled
to
record
they
touched
him
like
the
inarticulate
stammerings
in
which
childhood
strives
to
convey
its
meaning
he
found
gamba
lodging
on
the
upper
floor
of
a
decayed
palace
in
one
of
the
near
the
cathedral
the
pointed
arcades
of
this
ancient
building
enclosed
the
remains
of
floriated
mouldings
and
the
walls
of
the
court
showed
traces
of
but
now
hung
between
the
arches
and
about
the
in
the
centre
of
the
court
sat
a
group
of
tattered
women
with
children
playing
in
the
dirt
at
their
feet
one
of
these
women
directed
odo
to
the
staircase
which
ascended
between
damp
stone
walls
to
gamba
door
this
was
opened
by
the
hunchback
himself
who
with
an
astonished
exclamation
admitted
his
visitor
to
a
scantily
furnished
room
littered
with
books
and
papers
a
child
sprawled
on
the
floor
and
a
young
woman
who
had
been
sewing
in
the
fading
light
of
the
attic
window
snatched
him
up
as
odo
entered
her
back
being
turned
to
the
light
he
caught
only
a
slender
youthful
outline
but
something
in
the
turn
of
the
head
the
shrinking
curve
of
the
shoulders
carried
him
back
to
the
little
barefoot
figure
cowering
in
a
corner
of
the
kitchen
at
pontesordo
while
the
rang
with
filomena
call
where
are
you
then
child
of
iniquity
momola
do
you
know
me
he
exclaimed
she
hung
back
trembling
as
though
the
sound
of
his
voice
roused
an
echo
of
fear
but
gamba
reddening
slightly
took
her
hand
and
led
her
forward
it
is
indeed
said
he
your
excellency
old
playmate
the
momola
of
pontesordo
who
consents
to
share
my
poverty
and
who
makes
me
forget
it
by
the
tenderness
of
her
devotion
but
momola
at
this
found
voice
oh
sir
she
cried
it
is
he
who
took
me
in
when
i
was
and
starving
who
many
a
time
went
hungry
to
feed
me
and
who
cares
for
the
child
as
if
it
were
his
own
as
she
stood
there
in
her
beauty
which
seemed
a
sickly
efflorescence
of
the
marshes
pressing
to
her
breast
another
child
of
iniquity
as
pale
and
elfish
as
her
former
self
she
seemed
to
odo
the
embodiment
of
ancient
wrongs
risen
from
the
wasted
soil
to
haunt
the
dreams
of
its
oppressors
gamba
shrugged
his
shoulders
why
said
he
a
child
of
my
own
is
a
luxury
i
am
never
likely
to
possess
as
long
as
i
have
wit
to
remember
the
fundamental
axiom
of
philosophy
entia
non
sunt
multiplicanda
praeter
necessitatum
so
it
is
natural
enough
fate
should
single
me
out
to
repair
the
negligence
of
those
who
have
failed
to
observe
that
admirable
principle
and
now
he
added
turning
gently
to
momola
it
is
time
to
put
the
boy
to
bed
when
the
door
had
closed
on
her
odo
turned
to
gamba
i
could
learn
nothing
at
pontesordo
he
said
they
seemed
unwilling
to
speak
of
her
what
is
her
story
and
where
did
you
first
know
her
gamba
face
darkened
you
will
remember
cavaliere
he
said
that
some
time
after
your
departure
from
pianura
i
passed
into
the
service
of
the
marquess
of
cerveno
then
a
youth
of
about
twenty
who
combined
with
graceful
manners
and
a
fair
exterior
a
nature
so
corrupt
and
cowardly
that
he
seemed
like
some
such
noble
edifice
as
this
designed
to
house
great
hopes
and
high
ambitions
but
fallen
to
base
uses
and
become
the
shelter
of
thieves
and
prostitutes
prince
ferrante
being
sickly
from
his
birth
the
marquess
was
always
looked
on
as
the
duke
successor
and
to
trescorre
who
even
then
as
master
of
the
horse
cherished
the
ambitions
he
has
since
realised
no
prospect
could
have
been
more
distasteful
my
noble
brother
to
do
him
justice
has
always
hated
the
jesuits
who
as
you
doubtless
know
were
here
before
the
recent
suppression
of
the
order
the
marquess
of
cerveno
was
as
completely
under
their
control
as
the
duke
is
under
that
of
the
dominicans
and
trescorre
knew
that
with
the
marquess
accession
his
own
rule
must
end
he
did
his
best
to
gain
an
influence
over
his
future
ruler
but
failing
in
this
resolved
to
ruin
him
cerveno
like
all
your
house
was
passionately
addicted
to
the
chase
and
spent
much
time
hunting
in
the
forest
of
pontesordo
one
day
the
stag
was
brought
to
bay
in
the
of
the
old
manor
and
there
cerveno
saw
momola
then
a
girl
of
sixteen
of
a
singular
wild
beauty
which
sickness
and
trouble
have
since
effaced
the
young
marquess
was
instantly
taken
and
though
hitherto
indifferent
to
women
yielded
so
completely
to
his
infatuation
that
trescorre
ever
on
the
alert
saw
in
it
an
unexpected
means
to
his
end
he
instantly
married
momola
to
giannozzo
whom
she
feared
and
hated
he
schooled
giannozzo
in
the
part
of
the
jealous
and
vindictive
husband
and
by
the
liberal
use
of
money
contrived
that
momola
while
suffered
to
encourage
the
addresses
should
be
kept
so
close
that
cerveno
could
not
see
her
save
by
coming
to
pontesordo
this
was
the
first
step
in
the
plan
the
next
was
to
arrange
that
momola
should
lure
her
lover
to
the
on
the
edge
of
the
chase
this
lodge
as
your
excellency
may
remember
lies
level
with
the
marsh
and
so
open
to
noxious
exhalations
that
a
sojourn
there
may
be
fatal
the
infernal
scheme
was
carried
out
with
the
connivance
of
the
scoundrels
at
the
farm
who
had
no
scruples
about
selling
the
girl
for
a
few
ducats
and
as
to
momola
can
you
wonder
that
her
loathing
of
giannozzo
and
of
her
wretched
life
at
pontesordo
threw
her
defenceless
into
trescorre
toils
all
was
cunningly
planned
to
exasperate
cerveno
passion
and
momola
longing
to
escape
and
at
length
pressed
by
his
entreaties
and
innocently
carrying
out
the
designs
of
his
foe
the
poor
girl
promised
to
meet
him
after
at
the
the
secrecy
of
the
adventure
and
the
peril
to
which
it
exposed
him
for
trescorre
had
taken
care
to
paint
giannozzo
and
his
father
in
the
darkest
colours
were
fuel
to
cerveno
passion
and
he
went
night
after
night
to
pontesordo
the
time
was
august
when
the
marsh
breathes
death
and
the
duke
apprised
of
his
imprudence
forbade
his
returning
to
the
chase
nothing
could
better
have
served
trescorre
for
opposition
spurred
the
marquess
languid
temper
and
he
had
now
the
incredible
folly
to
take
up
his
residence
in
the
lodge
within
three
weeks
the
fever
held
him
he
was
at
once
taken
to
pianura
and
on
recovering
from
his
seizure
was
sent
to
take
the
mountain
air
at
the
baths
of
lucca
but
the
poison
was
in
his
blood
he
never
regained
more
than
a
semblance
of
health
and
his
madness
having
run
its
course
his
passion
for
momola
turned
to
hate
of
the
poor
girl
to
whom
he
ascribed
his
destruction
giannozzo
meanwhile
terrified
by
the
report
that
the
duke
had
winded
the
intrigue
and
fearing
to
be
charged
with
connivance
thought
to
prove
his
innocence
by
casting
off
his
wife
and
disowning
her
child
what
part
i
played
in
this
grim
business
i
leave
your
excellency
to
conceive
as
the
marquess
creature
i
was
forced
to
assist
at
the
spectacle
without
power
to
stay
its
consequences
but
when
the
child
was
born
i
carried
the
news
to
my
master
and
begged
him
to
come
to
the
mother
aid
for
answer
he
had
me
beaten
by
his
lacqueys
and
flung
out
of
his
house
i
stomached
the
beating
and
addressed
myself
to
trescorre
my
noble
brother
whose
insight
is
seldom
at
fault
saw
that
i
knew
enough
to
imperil
him
the
marquess
was
dying
and
his
enemy
could
afford
to
be
generous
he
gave
me
a
little
money
and
the
following
year
obtained
from
the
duke
my
appointment
as
assistant
librarian
in
this
way
i
was
able
to
give
momola
a
home
and
to
save
her
child
from
the
innocenti
she
and
i
cavaliere
are
the
misshapen
offspring
of
that
cruel
who
rears
more
than
half
the
malefactors
in
the
state
but
please
heaven
the
boy
shall
have
a
better
start
in
life
and
perhaps
grow
up
to
destroy
some
of
the
evils
on
which
that
cursed
charity
thrives
this
narrative
and
the
sight
of
momola
and
her
child
followed
so
strangely
on
the
spectacle
of
sordid
misery
he
had
witnessed
at
pontesordo
that
an
inarticulate
pity
held
odo
by
the
throat
anger
against
the
people
at
the
farm
seemed
as
senseless
as
their
own
cruelty
to
their
animals
what
were
they
all
momola
her
child
and
her
persecutors
but
a
sickly
growth
of
the
decaying
social
order
he
felt
an
almost
physical
longing
for
fresh
air
light
the
rush
of
a
purifying
wind
through
the
atmosphere
of
moral
darkness
that
surrounded
him
to
relieve
the
tension
of
his
thoughts
he
set
forth
to
gamba
the
purpose
of
his
visit
i
am
said
he
much
like
a
stranger
at
a
masked
ball
where
all
the
masks
are
acquainted
with
each
other
disguises
and
concerted
to
mystify
the
visitor
among
the
persons
i
have
met
at
court
several
have
shown
themselves
ready
to
guide
me
through
this
labyrinth
but
till
they
themselves
unmask
and
declare
their
true
characters
i
am
doubtful
whither
they
may
lead
me
nor
do
i
know
of
any
so
well
fitted
as
yourself
to
give
me
a
clue
to
my
surroundings
as
for
my
own
disguise
he
added
with
a
smile
i
believe
i
removed
it
sufficiently
on
our
first
meeting
to
leave
you
no
doubt
as
to
the
use
to
which
your
information
will
be
put
gamba
who
seemed
touched
by
this
appeal
nevertheless
hesitated
before
replying
at
length
he
said
i
have
the
fullest
trust
in
your
excellency
honour
but
i
must
remind
you
that
during
your
stay
here
you
will
be
under
the
closest
observation
and
that
any
opinions
you
express
will
at
once
be
attributed
to
the
persons
you
are
known
to
frequent
i
would
not
he
continued
hastily
say
this
for
myself
alone
but
i
have
two
mouths
to
feed
and
my
views
are
already
under
suspicion
reassured
by
odo
protestations
or
rather
perhaps
by
the
more
convincing
warrant
of
his
look
and
manner
gamba
proceeded
to
give
him
a
detailed
description
of
the
little
world
in
which
chance
had
placed
them
if
you
have
seen
the
duke
said
he
i
need
not
tell
you
that
it
is
not
he
who
governs
the
duchy
we
are
ruled
at
present
by
a
triumvirate
consisting
of
the
belverde
the
dominican
and
trescorre
pievepelago
the
prime
minister
is
a
dummy
put
in
place
by
the
jesuits
and
kept
there
by
the
rivalries
of
the
other
three
but
he
is
in
his
dotage
and
the
courtiers
are
already
laying
wagers
as
to
his
successor
many
think
father
ignazio
will
replace
him
but
i
stake
my
faith
on
trescorre
the
duke
dislikes
him
but
he
is
popular
with
the
middle
class
who
since
they
have
shaken
off
the
yoke
of
the
jesuits
would
not
willingly
see
an
ecclesiastic
at
the
head
of
the
state
the
duchess
influence
is
also
against
the
dominican
for
her
highness
being
as
you
know
connected
with
the
austrian
court
is
by
tradition
unfavourable
to
the
church
party
the
duchess
preferences
would
weigh
little
with
the
duke
were
it
not
that
she
is
sole
heiress
to
the
old
duke
of
monte
alloro
and
that
any
attempt
to
bring
that
principality
under
the
control
of
the
holy
see
might
provoke
the
interference
of
austria
in
so
ticklish
a
situation
i
see
none
but
trescorre
to
maintain
the
political
balance
he
has
been
adroit
enough
to
make
himself
necessary
to
the
duchess
without
alienating
the
duke
he
has
introduced
one
or
two
trifling
reforms
that
have
given
him
a
name
for
liberality
in
spite
of
the
heavy
taxes
with
which
he
has
loaded
the
peasantry
and
has
in
short
so
played
his
cards
as
to
profit
by
the
foibles
of
both
parties
her
highness
he
continued
in
reply
to
a
question
of
odo
was
much
taken
by
him
when
she
first
came
to
pianura
and
before
her
feeling
had
cooled
he
had
contrived
to
make
himself
indispensable
to
her
the
duchess
is
always
in
debt
and
trescorre
as
comptroller
of
finance
holds
her
by
her
besetting
weakness
before
his
appointment
her
extravagance
was
the
scandal
of
the
town
she
borrowed
from
her
ladies
her
pages
her
very
lacqueys
when
she
went
on
a
visit
to
her
uncle
of
monte
alloro
she
pocketed
the
money
he
bestowed
on
her
servants
nay
she
was
even
accused
of
robbing
the
marchioness
of
pievepelago
who
having
worn
one
evening
a
diamond
necklace
which
excited
her
admiration
was
waylaid
on
the
way
home
and
the
jewels
torn
from
her
neck
by
a
crowd
of
masked
ruffians
among
whom
she
is
said
to
have
recognised
one
of
the
ducal
servants
these
are
doubtless
idle
reports
but
it
is
certain
that
trescorre
appointment
engaged
him
still
more
to
the
duchess
by
enabling
him
to
protect
her
from
such
calumnies
while
by
increasing
the
land
taxes
he
has
discharged
the
worst
of
her
debts
and
thus
made
himself
popular
with
the
tradesmen
she
had
ruined
your
excellency
must
excuse
my
attempting
to
paint
the
private
character
of
her
highness
such
facts
as
i
have
reported
are
of
public
notoriety
but
to
exceed
them
would
be
an
unwarranted
presumption
i
know
she
has
the
name
of
being
affable
to
her
dependents
capable
of
a
fitful
generosity
and
easily
moved
by
distress
and
it
is
certain
that
her
domestic
situation
has
been
one
to
excite
pity
and
disarm
criticism
with
regard
to
his
highness
it
is
difficult
either
to
detect
his
motives
or
to
divine
his
preferences
his
youth
was
spent
in
pious
practices
and
a
curious
reason
is
given
for
the
origin
of
this
habit
he
was
educated
as
your
excellency
is
doubtless
aware
by
a
french
philosopher
of
the
school
of
hobbes
and
it
is
said
that
in
the
interval
of
his
tasks
the
poor
duke
bewildered
by
his
governor
distinctions
between
conception
and
cognition
and
the
object
and
the
sentient
used
to
spend
his
time
praying
the
saints
to
assist
him
in
his
atheistical
studies
indeed
a
satire
of
the
day
ascribes
him
as
making
a
novena
to
the
virgin
to
obtain
a
clearer
understanding
of
the
universality
of
matter
others
with
more
likelihood
aver
that
he
frequented
the
churches
to
escape
from
the
tyranny
of
his
pedagogue
and
it
is
certain
that
from
one
cause
or
another
his
education
threw
him
into
the
opposite
extreme
of
a
superstitious
and
mechanical
piety
his
marriage
his
differences
with
the
duchess
and
the
evil
influence
of
cerveno
exposed
him
to
new
temptations
and
for
a
time
he
led
a
life
which
seemed
to
justify
the
worst
charges
of
the
enemies
of
materialism
recent
events
have
flung
him
back
on
the
exaggerated
devotion
of
his
youth
and
now
when
his
health
permits
he
spends
his
time
serving
mass
singing
in
the
choir
at
benediction
and
making
pilgrimages
to
the
relics
of
the
saints
in
the
different
churches
of
the
duchy
a
few
years
since
at
the
instigation
of
his
confessor
he
destroyed
every
picture
in
the
ducal
gallery
that
contained
any
naked
figure
or
represented
any
subject
offensive
to
religion
among
them
was
famous
portrait
of
duke
ascanio
mistress
known
as
the
daughter
and
a
venus
by
the
venetian
painter
giorgione
so
highly
esteemed
in
its
day
that
pope
leo
is
said
to
have
offered
in
exchange
for
it
the
gift
of
a
papal
benefice
and
a
cardinal
hat
for
duke
guidobaldo
younger
son
his
highness
moreover
impedes
the
administration
of
justice
by
resisting
all
attempts
to
restrict
the
church
right
of
sanctuary
and
upholds
the
decree
forbidding
his
subjects
to
study
at
the
university
of
pavia
where
as
you
know
the
natural
sciences
are
professed
by
the
ablest
scholars
of
italy
he
allows
no
public
duties
to
interfere
with
his
private
devotions
and
whatever
the
urgency
of
affairs
gives
no
audience
to
his
ministers
on
holydays
and
a
cardinal
a
latere
recently
passing
through
the
duchy
on
his
return
to
rome
was
not
received
at
the
duke
table
because
he
chanced
to
arrive
on
a
friday
his
highness
fears
for
prince
ferrante
health
have
drawn
a
swarm
of
quacks
to
pianura
and
the
influence
of
the
church
is
sometimes
counteracted
by
that
of
the
physicians
with
whom
the
duke
surrounds
himself
the
latest
of
these
the
famous
count
heiligenstern
who
is
said
to
have
performed
some
remarkable
cures
by
means
of
the
electrical
fluid
and
of
animal
magnetism
has
gained
such
an
ascendancy
over
the
duke
that
some
suspect
him
of
being
an
agent
of
the
austrian
court
while
others
declare
that
he
is
a
jesuit
en
robe
courte
but
just
at
present
the
people
scent
a
jesuit
under
every
habit
and
it
is
even
rumoured
that
the
belverde
is
secretly
affiliated
to
a
female
branch
of
the
society
with
such
a
sovereign
and
such
ministers
your
excellency
need
not
be
told
how
the
state
is
governed
trescorre
heaven
save
the
mark
represents
the
liberal
party
but
his
liberalism
is
like
the
generosity
of
the
unarmed
traveller
who
throws
his
purse
to
a
and
father
ignazio
is
at
hand
to
see
that
the
people
are
not
bettered
at
the
expense
of
the
church
as
to
the
duke
having
no
settled
policy
and
being
governed
only
through
his
fears
he
leans
first
to
one
influence
and
then
to
another
but
since
the
suppression
of
the
jesuits
nothing
can
induce
him
to
attack
any
ecclesiastical
privileges
the
diocese
of
pianura
holds
a
fief
known
as
the
caccia
del
vescovo
long
noted
as
the
most
lawless
district
of
the
duchy
before
the
death
of
the
late
pope
trescorre
had
prevailed
on
the
duke
to
annex
it
to
the
principality
but
the
dreadful
fate
of
ganganelli
has
checked
bolder
sovereigns
than
his
highness
in
their
attempts
on
the
immunities
of
the
church
and
one
of
the
fairest
regions
of
our
unhappy
state
remains
a
barren
waste
the
lair
of
outlaws
and
assassins
and
a
menace
to
the
surrounding
country
his
highness
is
not
incapable
of
generous
impulses
and
his
occasional
acts
of
humanity
might
endear
him
to
his
people
were
it
not
that
they
despise
him
for
being
the
creature
of
his
favourites
thus
the
gift
of
boscofolto
to
the
belverde
has
excited
the
bitterest
discontent
for
the
countess
is
notorious
for
her
cruel
exactions
and
it
is
certain
that
at
her
death
this
rich
fief
will
revert
to
the
church
and
now
gamba
ended
with
a
smile
i
have
made
known
to
your
excellency
the
chief
characters
in
the
masque
as
rumour
depicts
them
to
the
vulgar
as
to
the
court
like
the
government
it
is
divided
into
two
parties
the
duke
headed
by
the
belverde
and
containing
the
staider
and
more
conservative
members
of
the
church
and
nobility
and
the
duchess
composed
of
every
fribble
and
flatterer
every
gamester
and
rake
every
intriguing
woman
and
vulgar
parvenu
that
can
worm
a
way
into
her
favour
in
such
an
atmosphere
you
may
fancy
how
knowledge
thrives
the
duke
library
consists
of
a
few
volumes
of
theological
casuistry
and
her
highness
never
opens
a
book
unless
it
be
to
scandalise
her
husband
by
reading
some
prohibited
pamphlet
from
france
the
university
since
the
fall
of
the
jesuits
has
been
in
charge
of
the
barnabite
order
and
for
aught
i
know
the
ptolemaic
system
is
still
taught
there
together
with
the
dialectic
of
aristotle
as
to
science
it
is
anathema
and
the
press
being
subject
to
the
restrictions
of
the
holy
office
and
the
university
closed

even
in
the

day
had
its
circle
of
lettered
noblemen
who
patronised
the
arts
and
founded
the
local
arcadia
but
such
pursuits
are
out
of
fashion
the
arcadia
languishes
and
the
bishop
of
pianura
is
the
only
dignitary
that
still
plays
the
mecaenas
his
lordship
whose
theological
laxity
and
coolness
toward
the
holy
office
have
put
him
out
of
favour
with

i

told
a
fine
cabinet
of
paintings
some
of
them

is
rumoured
the
very
pictures
that
his
highness
ordered
to
be
burnt
and
the
episcopal
palace
swarms
with
rhyming
abatini

playwrights
and
musicians

travelling
archeologists

their

here
you
may
assist
at
interminable
disputes
as

merits
of

or
listen
to
a
learned
dissertation
on
the
verse
engraved
on

stone
but
as
to
the
questions
now
agitating
the
world
they
are
held
of
less
account
than
a
problem
in
counterpoint

the
construction
of

doubtful
line

as
long
as

goes
naked
she
can
scarce
hope
to

and
her

would
probably
cause
as
much
confusion
among
the

as
in
the
councils
of
the
holy
office
the
old
analogy
likening
the
human
mind
to
an
imperfect
mirror
which
modifies
the
images
it
reflects
occurred
more
than
once
to
odo
during
the
hunchback
lively
delineation
it
was
impossible
not
to
remember
that
the
speaker
owed
his
education
to
the
charity
of
the
order
he
denounced
and
this
fact
suggested
to
odo
that
the
other
lights
and
shadows
in
the
picture
might
be
disposed
with
more
art
than
accuracy
still
they
doubtless
embodied
a
negative
truth
and
odo
thought
it
probable
that
such
intellectual
diversion
as
he
could
hope
for
must
be
sought
in
the
bishop
circle
it
was
two
days
later
that
he
first
beheld
that
prelate
heading
the
ducal
pilgrimage
to
the
shrine
of
the
mountain
virgin
the
day
had
opened
with
a
confused
flight
of
chimes
from
every
in
pianura
as
though
a
migratory
flock
of
notes
had
settled
for
a
moment
on
the
roofs
and
steeples
of
the
city
the
ducal
party
set
forth
early
from
the
palace
but
the
streets
were
already
spanned
with
arches
and
garlands
of
foliage
tapestries
and
religious
paintings
decked
the
facades
of
the
wealthier
houses
and
at
every
a
cluster
of
hovered
like
yellow
butterflies
above
the
flowers
the
windows
were
packed
with
spectators
and
the
crowds
who
intended
to
accompany
the
pilgrimage
were
already
gathering
with
their
painted
and
gilt
candles
from
every
corner
of
the
town
each
church
and
monastery
door
poured
forth
its
priests
or
friars
to
swell
the
line
and
the
various
lay
confraternities
issuing
in
their
distinctive
dress
from
their
lodges
or
formed
a
link
between
the
secular
and
religious
divisions
of
the
procession
the
was
strewn
with
sand
and
sweet
herbs
and
here
on
the
doorsteps
of
the
cathedral
between
the
featureless
porphyry
lions
the
bishop
waited
with
his
chapter
and
the
deacons
carrying
the
painted
banners
of
the
diocese
seen
thus
with
the
dalmatic
above
his
pontifical
tunic
the
mitre
surmounting
his
impassive
face
and
the
crozier
held
aloft
in
his
jewelled
gloves
he
might
have
stood
for
a
chryselephantine
divinity
in
the
porch
of
some
pagan
temple
odo
riding
beside
the
duke
litter
had
leisure
to
note
not
only
the
diverse
features
of
the
procession
but
their
varying
effect
on
the
spectators
it
was
plain
that
as
trescorre
had
said
the
pilgrimage
was
popular
with
the
people
that
imaginative
sensuousness
which
has
perpetually
renewed
the
latin
church
by
giving
form
and
colour
to
her
dogmatic
abstractions
by
transforming
every
successive
phase
of
her
belief
into
something
to
be
seen
and
handled
found
an
irresistible
outlet
in
a
ceremony
that
seemed
to
combine
with
its
devotional
intent
a
secret
element
of
expiation
the
little
prince
was
dimly
felt
to
be
paying
for
the
prodigality
of
his
fathers
to
be
in
some
way
a
link
of
suffering
between
the
misery
of
the
fields
and
the
insolent
splendour
of
the
court
and
a
vague
faith
in
the
vicarious
efficacy
of
his
devotion
drew
the
crowd
into
momentary
sympathy
with
its
rulers
yet
this
was
but
an
underlying
element
in
the
instinctive
delight
of
the
people
in
the
outward
forms
of
their
religion
odo
late
experiences
had
wakened
him
to
the
influences
acting
on
that
obscure
substratum
of
human
life
that
still
seemed
to
most
men
of
his
rank
of
no
more
account
than
the
brick
lining
of
their
palaces
as
he
watched
the
mounting
excitement
of
the
throng
and
pictured
to
himself
the
lives
suddenly
lit
up
by
this
pledge
of
unseen
promises
he
wondered
that
the
enemies
of
the
church
should
ascribe
her
predominance
to
any
cause
but
the
natural
needs
of
the
heart
the
people
lived
in
unlit
hovels
for
there
was
a
tax
on
mental
as
well
as
on
material
windows
but
here
was
a
light
that
could
pierce
the
narrowest
crevice
and
scatter
the
darkness
with
a
single
ray
odo
noted
with
equal
interest
the
impression
produced
by
the
various
members
of
the
court
and
the
church
dignitaries
the
duke
litter
was
coldly
received
but
a
pitying
murmur
widened
about
the
gilt
chair
in
which
prince
ferrante
was
seated
at
his
governor
side
and
the
approach
of
trescorre
mounted
on
a
fine
horse
and
dressed
with
his
usual
sober
elegance
woke
a
shout
that
made
him
for
a
moment
the
central
figure
of
the
procession
the
bishop
was
none
too
warmly
welcomed
but
when
crescenti
appeared
and
erect
among
the
parish
priests
the
crowd
swayed
toward
him
like
grasses
in
the
suction
of
a
current
and
one
of
the
duke
gentlemen
seeing
odo
surprise
said
with
a
smile
no
one
does
more
good
in
pianura
than
our
learned
librarian
a
different
and
still
more
striking
welcome
awaited
the
duchess
who
presently
appeared
on
her
favourite
white
hackney
surrounded
by
the
members
of
her
household
her
reluctance
to
take
part
in
the
pilgrimage
had
been
overcome
by
the
exhilaration
of
showing
herself
to
the
public
and
as
she
rode
along
in
her
habit
and
plumed
hat
she
was
just
such
an
image
of
radiant
and
indulgent
sovereignty
as
turns
enforced
submission
into
a
romantic
allegiance
her
flushing
cheek
and
kindled
eye
showed
the
reaction
of
the
effect
she
produced
and
if
her
subjects
forgot
her
debts
her
violences
and
follies
she
was
perhaps
momentarily
transformed
into
the
being
their
enthusiasm
created
she
was
at
any
rate
keenly
alive
to
the
admiration
she
excited
and
eager
to
enhance
it
by
those
showy
impulses
of
benevolence
that
catch
the
public
eye
as
when
at
the
city
gates
she
stopped
her
horse
to
intervene
in
behalf
of
a
soldier
who
had
been
put
under
arrest
for
some
slight
infraction
of
duty
and
then
rode
on
enveloped
in
the
passionate
shouting
of
the
crowd
the
shrine
at
which
the
young
prince
was
to
pay
his
devotions
stood
just
beyond
the
city
on
the
summit
of
one
of
the
low
knolls
which
pass
for
hills
in
the
level
landscape
of
pianura
the
church
with
its
classical
dome
and
portico
had
been
erected
as
a
after
the
plague
of
and
the
nave
was
lined
with
votive
figures
of
dukes
and
duchesses
clad
in
the
actual
wigs
and
robes
that
had
dressed
their
transient
grandeur
as
the
procession
wound
into
the
church
to
the
ringing
of
bells
and
the
chanting
of
the
choir
odo
was
struck
by
the
spectacle
of
that
line
of
witnesses
watching
in
irony
the
pomp
and
display
to
which
their
moldering
robes
and
tarnished
insignia
seemed
to
fix
so
brief
a
term
once
or
twice
already
he
had
felt
the
shows
of
human
power
as
no
more
than
vanishing
reflections
on
the
tide
of
being
and
now
as
he
knelt
near
the
shrine
with
its
central
glitter
of
jewels
and
its
nimbus
of
wavering
lights
and
listened
to
the
reiterated
ancient
wail
mater
inviolata
ora
pro
nobis
virgo
veneranda
ora
pro
nobis
speculum
justitiae
ora
pro
nobis
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
the
bounds
of
life
and
death
were
merged
and
the
sumptuous
group
of
which
he
formed
a
part
already
dusted
over
with
oblivion
spite
of
the
mountain
madonna
powers
the
first
effect
of
the
pilgrimage
was
to
provoke
a
serious
indisposition
in
the
duke
exhausted
by
fasting
and
emotion
he
withdrew
to
his
apartments
and
for
several
days
denied
himself
to
all
but
heiligenstern
who
was
suspected
by
some
of
suffering
his
patient
disorder
to
run
its
course
with
a
view
to
proving
the
futility
of
such
remedies
this
break
in
his
intercourse
with
his
kinsman
left
odo
free
to
take
the
measure
of
his
new
surroundings
the
company
most
naturally
engaging
him
was
that
which
surrounded
the
duchess
but
he
soon
wearied
of
the
trivial
diversions
it
offered
it
had
ever
been
necessary
to
him
that
his
pleasures
should
touch
the
imagination
as
well
as
the
senses
and
with
such
refinement
of
enjoyment
the
gallants
of
pianura
were
unacquainted
odo
indeed
perceived
with
a
touch
of
amusement
that
in
a
society
where
don
serafino
set
the
pace
he
must
needs
lag
behind
his
own
lacquey
cantapresto
had
in
fact
been
hailed
by
the
bishop
nephew
with
a
cordiality
that
proclaimed
them
old
associates
in
folly
and
the
soprano
manner
seemed
to
declare
that
if
ever
he
had
held
the
candle
for
don
serafino
he
did
not
grudge
the
grease
that
might
have
dropped
on
his
cassock
he
was
soon
prime
favourite
and
court
buffoon
in
the
duchess
circle
organising
composing
scenarios
for
her
highness
private
theatre
and
producing
at
court
any
comedian
or
juggler
the
report
of
whose
ability
reached
him
from
the
indefatigable
in
the
contriving
of
such
diversions
he
soon
virtually
passed
out
of
odo
service
into
that
of
her
highness
a
circumstance
which
the
young
man
the
less
regretted
as
it
left
him
freer
to
cultivate
the
acquaintance
of
gamba
and
his
friends
without
exposing
them
to
cantapresto
espionage
odo
had
felt
himself
specially
drawn
toward
the
abate
crescenti
and
the
afternoon
after
their
first
meeting
he
had
repaired
to
the
dwelling
crescenti
was
the
priest
of
an
ancient
parish
lying
near
the
fortress
and
his
tiny
house
was
wedged
in
an
angle
of
the
city
walls
like
a
bird
nest
in
the
mouth
of
a
disused
canon
a
long
flight
of
steps
led
up
to
his
study
which
on
the
farther
side
opened
level
with
a
patch
of
herbs
and
damask
roses
in
the
projection
of
a
ruined
bastion
this
interior
the
home
of
studious
peace
was
as
cheerful
and
as
its
inmate
mind
and
odo
seated
under
the
vine
pergola
in
the
late
summer
light
and
tasting
the
abate
val
pulicella
while
he
turned
over
the
warped
pages
of
old
codes
and
chronicles
felt
the
stealing
charm
of
a
sequestered
life
he
had
learned
from
gamba
that
crescenti
was
a
faithful
parish
priest
as
well
as
an
assiduous
scholar
but
he
saw
that
the
beneficence
took
that
purely
personal
form
which
may
coexist
with
a
serene
acceptance
of
the
general
evils
underlying
particular
hardships
his
charities
were
performed
in
the
old
unquestioning
spirit
of
the
roman
distribution
of
corn
and
doubtless
the
good
man
who
carries
his
loaf
of
bread
and
his
word
of
hope
into
his
neighbour
hovel
reaps
a
more
tangible
return
than
the
lonely
thinker
who
schemes
to
undermine
the
strongholds
of
injustice
still
there
was
a
perplexing
contrast
between
the
superficiality
of
crescenti
moral
judgments
and
the
breadth
and
penetration
of
his
historic
conceptions
odo
was
too
inexperienced
to
reflect
that
a
man
sense
of
the
urgency
of
improvement
lies
mainly
in
the
line
of
his
talent
as
the
merchant
is
persuaded
that
the
roads
most
in
need
of
mending
are
those
on
which
his
business
makes
him
travel
odo
himself
was
already
conscious
of
living
in
a
house
with
outlooks
diverse
enough
to
justify
more
than
one
view
of
the
universe
but
he
had
no
conception
of
that
concentration
of
purpose
that
may
make
the
mind
flight
to
its
goal
as
direct
and
unvarying
as
the
course
of
a
homing
bird
the
talk
turning
on
gamba
crescenti
spoke
of
the
help
which
the
hunchback
gave
him
in
his
work
among
the
poor
his
early
hardships
said
he
have
given
him
an
insight
into
character
that
my
happier
circumstances
have
denied
me
and
he
has
more
than
once
been
the
means
of
reclaiming
some
wretch
that
i
despaired
of
unhappily
his
parts
and
learning
are
beyond
his
station
and
will
not
let
him
rest
in
the
performance
of
his
duties
his
mind
i
often
tell
him
is
like
one
of
those
inn
parlours
hung
with
elaborate
maps
of
the
three
heretical
cities
whereas
the
only
topography
with
which
the
virtuous
traveller
need
be
acquainted
is
that
of
the
heavenly
city
to
which
all
our
journeyings
should
tend
the
soundness
of
his
heart
reassures
me
as
to
this
distemper
of
the
reason
but
others
are
less
familiar
with
his
good
qualities
and
i
tremble
for
the
risks
to
which
his
rashness
may
expose
him
the
librarian
went
on
to
say
that
gamba
had
a
pretty
poetical
gift
which
he
was
suspected
of
employing
in
the
composition
of
anonymous
satires
on
the
court
the
government
and
the
church
at
that
period
every
italian
town
was
as
full
of
lampoons
as
a
marsh
of
mosquitoes
and
it
was
as
difficult
in
the
one
case
as
the
other
for
the
sufferer
to
detect
the
specific
cause
of
his
sting
the
moment
in
italy
was
a
strange
one
the
tide
of
reform
had
been
turned
back
by
the
very
act
devised
to
hasten
it
the
suppression
of
the
society
of
jesus
the
shout
of
liberation
that
rose
over
the
downfall
of
the
order
had
sunk
to
a
guarded
whisper
the
dark
legend
already
forming
around
ganganelli
death
the
hint
of
that
secret
liquor
distilled
for
the
order
use
in
a
certain
convent
of
perugia
hung
like
a
menace
on
the
political
horizon
and
the
disbanded
society
seemed
to
have
tightened
its
hold
on
the
public
conscience
as
a
dying
man
clutch
closes
on
his
victorious
enemy
so
profoundly
had
the
jesuits
impressed
the
world
with
the
sense
of
their
mysterious
power
that
they
were
felt
to
be
like
one
of
those
animal
organisms
which
when
torn
apart
carry
on
a
separate
existence
in
every
fragment
ganganelli
bull
had
provided
against
their
exerting
any
political
influence
or
controlling
opinion
as
confessors
or
as
public
educators
but
they
were
known
to
be
everywhere
in
italy
either
hidden
in
other
orders
or
acting
as
lay
agents
of
foreign
powers
as
tutors
in
private
families
or
simply
as
secular
priests
even
the
confiscation
of
their
wealth
did
not
seem
to
diminish
the
popular
sense
of
their
strength
perhaps
because
that
strength
had
never
been
completely
explained
even
by
their
immense
temporal
advantages
it
was
felt
to
be
latent
in
themselves
and
somehow
capable
of
withstanding
every
kind
of
external
assault
they
had
moreover
benefited
by
the
reaction
which
always
follows
on
the
breaking
up
of
any
great
organisation
their
detractors
were
already
beginning
to
forget
their
faults
and
remember
their
merits
the
people
had
been
taught
to
hate
the
society
as
the
possessor
of
wealth
and
privileges
which
should
have
been
theirs
but
when
the
society
fell
its
possessions
were
absorbed
by
the
other
powers
and
in
many
cases
the
people
suffered
from
abuses
and
maladministration
which
they
had
not
known
under
their
jesuit
landlords
the
aristocracy
had
always
been
in
sympathy
with
the
order
and
in
many
states
the
jesuits
had
been
banished
simply
as
a
measure
of
political
expediency
a
sop
to
the
restless
masses
in
these
cases
the
latent
power
of
the
order
was
concealed
rather
than
diminished
by
the
pretence
of
a
more
liberal
government
and
everywhere
in
one
form
or
another
the
unseen
influence
was
felt
to
be
on
the
watch
for
those
who
dared
to
triumph
over
it
too
soon
such
conditions
fostered
the
growth
of
social
satire
constructive
ambition
was
forced
back
into
its
old
disguises
and
ridicule
of
individual
weaknesses
replaced
the
general
attack
on
beliefs
and
institutions
satirical
poems
in
manuscript
passed
from
hand
to
hand
in
casinos
and
and
every
conspicuous
incident
in
social
or
political
life
was
borne
on
a
biting
quatrain
to
the
confines
of
the
state
the
duke
gift
of
boscofolto
to
the
countess
belverde
had
stirred
up
a
swarm
of
epigrams
and
the
most
malignant
among
them
crescenti
averred
were
openly
ascribed
to
gamba
a
few
more
imprudences
he
added
must
cost
him
his

and
if
your
excellency
has
any
influence
with
him
i
would
urge
its
being
used
to
restrain
him
from
such
excesses
odo
on
taking
his
leave
of
the
librarian
ran
across
gamba
at
the
first
and
they
had
not
proceeded
a
dozen
yards
together
when
the
eye
of
the
duke
kinsman
fell
on
a
snatch
of
doggerel
scrawled
in
chalk
on
an
adjacent
wall
beware

for

lest
first
he
woo
thee
to
the
leafy
glade
and
then
into
the

this
crude
play
on
the
belverde
former
title
and
the
one
she
had
recently
acquired
was
signed
carlo
gamba
odo
glanced
curiously
at
the
hunchback
who
met
the
look
with
a
composed
smile
my
enemies
do
do
me
justice
said
he
i
could
do
better
than
that
if
i
tried
and
he
effaced
the
words
with
a
sweep
of
his
shabby
sleeve
other
lampoons
of
the
same
quality
were
continually
cropping
up
on
the
walls
of
pianura
and
the
ducal
police
were
kept
as
busy
rubbing
them
out
as
a
band
of
weeders
digging
docks
out
of
a
garden
the
debts
the
duke
devotions
the
belverde
extortions
mummery
and
the
political
rivalry
between
trescorre
and
the
dominican
were
sauce
to
the
citizen
daily
bread
but
there
was
nothing
in
these
popular
satires
to
suggest
the
hunchback
trenchant
irony
it
was
in
the
bishop
palace
that
odo
read
the
first
lampoon
in
which
he
recognised
his
friend
touch
in
this
society
of
polished
dilettanti
such
documents
were
valued
rather
for
their
literary
merits
than
for
their
political
significance
and
the
pungent
lines
in
which
the
panaceas
were
hit
off
the
belverde
figuring
among
them
as
a
lenten
diet
a
dinner
of
herbs
and
a
bone
caused
a
flutter
of
professional
envy
in
the
episcopal
circle
the
bishop
received
company
every
evening
and
odo
soon
found
that
as
gamba
had
said
it
was
the
best
company
in
pianura
his
lordship
lived
in
great
state
in
the
gothic
palace
adjoining
the
cathedral
the
gloomy
vaulted
rooms
of
the
original
structure
had
been
abandoned
to
the
small
fry
of
the
episcopal
retinue
in
the
chambers
around
the
courtyard
his
lordship
drove
a
thriving
trade
in
wines
from
his
vineyards
while
his
clients
awaited
his
pleasure
in
the
armoury
where
the
panoplies
of
his
fighting
predecessors
still
rusted
on
the
walls
behind
this
facade
a
later
prelate
had
built
a
vast
wing
overlooking
a
garden
which
descended
by
easy
terraces
to
the
piana
in
the
apartments
of
this
wing
the
bishop
held
his
court
and
lived
the
life
of
a
wealthy
secular
nobleman
his
days
were
agreeably
divided
between
hunting
inspecting
his
estates
receiving
the
visits
of
antiquarians
artists
and
literati
and
superintending
the
embellishments
of
his
gardens
then
the
most
famous
in
north
italy
while
his
evenings
were
given
to
the
more
private
diversions
which
his
age
and
looks
still
justified
in
religious
ceremonies
or
in
formal
intercourse
with
his
clergy
he
was
the
most
imposing
and
sacerdotal
of
bishops
but
in
private
life
none
knew
better
how
to
disguise
his
cloth
he
was
moreover
a
man
of
parts
and
from
the
construction
of
a
latin
hexameter
to
the
growing
of
a
holland
bulb
had
a
word
worth
hearing
on
all
subjects
likely
to
engage
the
dilettante
a
liking
soon
sprang
up
between
odo
and
this
versatile
prelate
and
in
the
retirement
of
his
lordship
cabinet
or
pacing
with
him
the
set
with
ancient
marbles
the
young
man
gathered
many
precepts
of
that
philosophy
of
pleasure
which
the
great
churchmen
of
the
eighteenth
century
practised
with
such
rare
completeness
the
bishop
had
not
indeed
given
much
thought
to
the
problems
which
most
deeply
engaged
his
companion
his
theory
of
life
took
no
account
of
the
future
and
concerned
itself
little
with
social
conditions
outside
his
own
class
but
he
was
acquainted
with
the
classical
schools
of
thought
and
having
once
acted
as
the
late
duke
envoy
to
the
french
court
had
frequented
the
baron
and
familiarised
himself
with
the
views
of
the
encyclopaedists
though
it
was
clear
that
he
valued
their
teachings
chiefly
as
an
argument
against
asceticism
life
said
he
to
odo
as
they
sat
one
afternoon
in
a
above
the
river
a
marble
mercury
confronting
them
at
the
end
of
a
vista
of
clipped
myrtle

stock
on
which
we
may
graft
what
fruit
or
flower
we
choose

week
or
two

here
again
is
a
citron
set
with

and
but
yesterday
my
gardener
sent
me
word
that
he
had
at
last
succeeded
in
flowering
a
pomegranate
with
jasmine
in
such
cases
the
gardener
chooses
as
his
graft
the
flower
which
by
its
colour
and
fragrance
shall
most
agreeably
contrast
with
the
original
stock
and
he
who
orders
his
life
on
the
same
principle
grafting
it
with
pleasures
that
form
a
refreshing
to
the
obligations
of
his
rank
and
calling
may
regard
himself
as
justified
by
nature
who
as
you
see
smiles
on
such
abnormal
unions
among
her
not
long
ago
he
went
on
with
a
reminiscent
smile
i
had
here
under
my
roof
a
young
person
who
practised
to
perfection
this
art
of
engrafting
life
with
the
unexpected
though
she
was
only
a
player
in
a
strolling
company
a
sweetheart
of
my
wild
nephew
as
you
may
guess
i
have
met
few
of
her
sex
whose
conversation
was
so
instructive
or
who
so
completely
justified
the
scriptural
adage
the
sweetness
of
the
lips
increaseth
learning
he
broke
off
to
sip
his
chocolate
but
why
he
continued
do
i
talk
thus
to
a
young
man
whose
path
is
lined
with
such
opportunities
the
secret
of
happiness
is
to
say
with
the
great
emperor
is
fruit
to
me
which
thy
seasons
bring
o
nature
such
a
creed
monsignore
odo
ventured
to
return
is
as
flattering
to
the
intelligence
as
to
the
senses
for
surely
it
better
becomes
a
reasoning
being
to
face
fate
as
an
equal
than
to
cower
before
it
like
a
slave
but
since
you
have
opened
yourself
so
freely
on
the
subject
may
i
carry
your
argument
a
point
farther
and
ask
how
you
reconcile
your
conception
of
man
destiny
with
the
authorised
teachings
of
the
church
the
bishop
raised
his
head
with
a
guarded
glance
cavaliere
said
he
the
ancients
did
not
admit
the
rabble
to
their
sacred
mysteries
nor
dare
we
permit
the
unlettered
to
enter
the
hollowed
precincts
of
the
temple
of
reason
true
odo
acquiesced
but
if
the
teachings
of
christianity
are
the
best
safeguard
of
the
people
should
not
those
teachings
at
least
be
stripped
of
the
grotesque
excrescences
with
which
the
superstitions
of
the
people
and
perhaps
the
greed
and
craft
of
the
priesthood
have
smothered
the
simple
precepts
of
jesus
the
bishop
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
long
said
he
as
the
people
need
the
restraint
of
a
dogmatic
religion
so
long
must
we
do
our
utmost
to
maintain
its
outward
forms
in
our
on
there
appears
the
strange
figure
of
a
man
who
carries
a
banner
painted
with
an
image
of
saint
paul
surrounded
by
a
mass
of
writhing
serpents
this
man
calls
himself
a
descendant
of
the
apostle
and
sells
to
our
peasants
the
miraculous
powder
with
which
he
killed
the
great
serpent
at
malta
if
it
were
not
for
the
banner
the
legend
the
descent
from
saint
paul
how
much
efficacy
do
you
think
those
powders
would
have
and
how
long
do
you
think
the
precepts
of
an
invisible
divinity
would
restrain
the
evil
passions
of
an
ignorant
peasant
it
is
because
he
is
afraid
of
the
plaster
god
in
his
parish
church
and
of
the
priest
who
represents
that
god
that
he
still
pays
his
tithes
and
forfeitures
and
keeps
his
hands
from
our
throats
by
diana
cried
the
bishop
taking
snuff
i
have
no
patience
with
those
of
my
calling
who
go
about
whining
for
apostolic
simplicity
and
would
rob
the
churches
of
their
ornaments
and
the
faithful
of
their
ceremonies
for
my
part
he
added
glancing
with
a
smile
about
the
walls
of
the
pavilion
through
the
windows
of
which
climbing
roses
shed
their
petals
on
the
rich
mosaics
transferred
from
a
roman
bath
for
my
part
when
i
remember
that
is
to
jesus
of
nazareth
i
owe
the
good
roof
over
my
head
and
the
good
nags
in
my
stable
nay
the
very
venison
and
pheasants
from
my
preserves
with
the
gold
plate
i
eat
them
off
and
above
all
the
leisure
to
enjoy
as
they
deserve
these
excellent
gifts
of
the
creator
when
i
consider
this
i
say
i
stand
amazed
at
those
who
would
rob
so
beneficent
a
deity
of
the
least
of
his
but
why
he
continued
again
after
a
moment
as
odo
remained
silent
should
we
vex
ourselves
with
such
questions
when
providence
has
given
us
so
fair
a
world
to
enjoy
and
such
varied
faculties
with
which
to
apprehend
its
beauties
i
think
you
have
not
seen
the
venus
callipyge
in
bronze
that
i
have
lately
received
from
rome
and
he
rose
and
led
the
way
to
the
house
this
conversation
revealed
to
odo
a
third
conception
of
the
religious
idea
in
piedmont
religion
imposed
itself
as
a
military
discipline
the
enforced
duty
of
the
christian
citizen
to
the
heavenly
state
to
the
duke
it
was
a
means
of
purchasing
spiritual
immunity
from
the
consequences
of
bodily
weakness
to
the
bishop
it
replaced
the
panem
et
circenses
of
ancient
rome
where
in
all
this
was
the
share
of
those
whom
christ
had
come
to
save
where
was
saint
francis
devotion
to
his
heavenly
bride
the
lady
poverty
though
here
and
there
a
good
parish
priest
like
crescenti
ministered
to
the
temporal
wants
of
the
peasantry
it
was
only
the
and
the
atheist
who
at
the
risk
of
life
and
fortune
laboured
for
their
moral
liberation
odo
listened
with
a
saddened
heart
thinking
as
he
followed
his
host
through
the
perfumed
shade
of
the
gardens
and
down
the
long
saloon
at
the
end
of
which
the
venus
stood
of
those
who
for
the
love
of
man
had
denied
themselves
such
delicate
emotions
and
gone
forth
cheerfully
to
exile
or
imprisonment
these
were
the
true
lovers
of
the
lady
poverty
the
band
in
which
he
longed
to
be
enrolled
yet
how
restrain
a
thrill
of
delight
as
the
slender
dusky
goddess
detached
herself
against
the
cool
marble
of
her
niche
looking
in
the
green
penumbra
of
the
saloon
with
a
sound
of
water
falling
somewhere
out
of
sight
as
though
she
had
just
stepped
dripping
from
the
wave
in
the
duchess
company
life
struck
another
gait
here
was
no
waiting
on
subtle
pleasures
but
a
headlong
gallop
after
the
cruder
sort
hunting
gaming
and
masquerading
filled
her
highness
days
and
odo
had
felt
small
inclination
to
keep
pace
with
the
cavalcade
but
for
the
flying
huntress
at
its
head
to
the
duchess
view
halloo
every
drop
of
blood
in
him
responded
but
a
vigilant
image
kept
his
bosom
barred
so
they
rode
danced
diced
together
but
like
strangers
who
cross
hands
at
a
veglione
once
or
twice
he
fancied
the
duchess
was
for
unmasking
but
her
impulses
came
and
went
like
fireflies
in
the
dusk
and
it
suited
his
humour
to
remain
a
so
life
piped
to
him
during
his
first
days
at
pianura
a
merry
tune
in
the
bishop
company
a
mad
one
in
the
duchess
but
always
with
the
same
sad
undertone
like
the
cry
of
the
wind
on
a
warm
threshold
trescorre
too
kept
open
house
and
here
odo
found
a
warmer
welcome
than
he
had
expected
though
trescorre
was
still
the
duchess
accredited
lover
it
was
clear
that
the
tie
between
them
was
no
longer
such
as
to
make
him
resent
her
kindness
to
her
young
kinsman
he
seemed
indeed
anxious
to
draw
odo
into
her
highness
circle
and
surprised
him
by
a
frankness
and
affability
of
which
his
demeanour
at
turin
had
given
no
promise
as
leader
of
the
he
stood
for
such
liberalism
as
dared
show
its
head
in
pianura
and
he
seemed
disposed
to
invite
confidence
in
political
matters
the
latter
was
however
too
much
the
child
of
his
race
not
to
hang
back
from
such
an
invitation
he
did
not
distrust
trescorre
more
than
the
other
courtiers
but
it
was
a
time
when
every
ear
was
alert
for
the
of
treachery
and
the
rashest
man
did
not
care
to
taste
first
of
any
cup
that
was
offered
him
these
scruples
trescorre
made
it
his
business
to
dispel
he
was
the
only
person
at
court
who
was
willing
to
discuss
politics
and
his
clear
view
of
affairs
excited
odo
admiration
if
not
his
concurrence
odo
was
in
fact
one
of
those
dual
visions
which
instinctively
see
both
sides
of
a
case
and
take
the
defence
of
the
less
popular
gamba
principles
were
dear
to
him
but
he
did
not
therefore
believe
in
the
personal
baseness
of
every
opponent
of
the
cause
he
had
refrained
from
mentioning
the
hunchback
to
his
supposed
brother
but
the
latter
in
one
of
their
talks
brought
forward
gamba
name
without
reference
to
the
relationship
but
with
high
praise
for
the
young
librarian
parts
this
at
the
moment
put
odo
on
his
guard
but
trescorre
having
one
day
begged
him
to
give
gamba
warning
of
some
petty
danger
that
threatened
him
from
the
clerical
side
it
became
difficult
not
to
believe
in
an
interest
so
attested
the
more
so
as
trescorre
let
it
be
seen
that
gamba
political
views
were
not
such
as
to
distract
from
his
sympathy
the
fellow
brains
said
he
would
be
of
infinite
use
to
me
but
perhaps
he
serves
us
best
at
a
distance
all
i
ask
is
that
he
shall
not
risk
himself
too
near
father
ignazio
talons
for
he
would
be
a
pretty
morsel
to
throw
to
the
holy
office
and
the
weak
point
of
such
a
position
is
that
however
dangerous
in
life
he
can
threaten
no
one
from
the
grave
odo
reported
this
to
gamba
who
heard
with
a
smile
yes
was
his
comment
he
fears
me
enough
to
want
to
see
me
safe
in
his
fold
odo
flushed
at
the
implication
and
why
not
said
he
could
you
not
serve
the
cause
better
by
attaching
yourself
openly
to
the
liberals
than
by
lurking
in
the
ditch
to
throw
mud
at
both
parties
the
liberals
sneered
gamba
where
are
they
and
what
have
they
done
it
was
they
who
drove
out
the
jesuits
but
to
whom
did
the
lands
go
to
the
duke
every
acre
of
them
and
the
peasantry
suffered
far
less
under
the
fathers
who
were
good
agriculturists
than
under
the
duke
who
is
too
busy
with
monks
and
astrologers
to
give
his
mind
to
irrigation
or
the
reclaiming
of
waste
land
as
to
the
university
who
replaced
the
jesuits
there
professors
from
padua
or
pavia
heaven
forbid
but
holy
barnabites
that
have
scarce
latin
enough
to
spell
out
the
lives
of
the
saints
the
jesuits
at
least
gave
a

the

trescorre
received
at
his
house
besides
the
court
functionaries
all
the
liberal
faction
and
the
duchess
personal
friends
he
kept
a
lavish
state
but
lacking
the
bishop
social
gifts
was
less
successful
in
fusing
the
different
elements
of
his
circle
the
duke
for
the
first
few
weeks
after
his
kinsman
arrival
received
no
company
and
did
not
even
appear
in
the
belverde
but
odo
deemed
it
none
the
less
politic
to
show
himself
there
without
delay
the
new
marchioness
of
boscofolto
lived
in
one
of
the
finest
palaces
of
pianura
but
prodigality
was
the
least
of
her
failings
and
the
meagreness
of
her
hospitality
was
an
unfailing
source
of
epigram
to
the
of
the
opposition
true
she
kept
open
table
for
half
the
clergy
in
the
town
omitting
of
course
those
worldly
ecclesiastics
who
frequented
the
episcopal
palace
but
it
was
whispered
that
she
had
persuaded
her
cook
to
take
half
wages
in
return
for
the
privilege
of
victualling
such
holy
men
and
that
the
same
argument
enabled
her
to
obtain
her
provisions
below
the
market
price
in
her
outer
the
servants
yawned
dismally
over
a
cold
brazier
without
so
much
as
a
game
of
cards
to
divert
them
and
the
long
enfilade
of
saloons
leading
to
her
was
so
scantily
lit
that
her
guests
could
scarce
recognise
each
other
in
passing
in
the
room
where
she
sat
a
tall
crucifix
of
ebony
and
gold
stood
at
her
elbow
and
a
cup
encrusted
with
jewels
hung
on
the
wall
at
her
side
a
dozen
or
more
ecclesiastics
were
always
gathered
in
stiff
seats
about
the
hearth
and
the
aspect
of
the
apartment
and
the
marchioness
costume
justified
the
nickname
of
the
sacristy
which
the
duchess
had
bestowed
on
her
rival
around
the
small
fire
on
this
cheerless
hearth
the
fortunes
of
the
state
were
discussed
and
directed
benefices
disposed
of
court
appointments
debated
and
reputations
made
and
unmade
in
tones
that
suggested
the
low
drone
of
a
group
of
canons
intoning
the
psalter
in
an
empty
cathedral
the
marchioness
who
appeared
as
eager
as
the
others
to
win
odo
to
her
party
received
him
with
every
mark
of
consideration
and
pressed
him
to
accompany
her
on
a
visit
to
her
brother
the
abbot
of
the
barnabites
an
invitation
which
he
accepted
with
the
more
readiness
as
he
had
not
forgotten
the
part
played
by
that
religious
in
the
adventure
of
mirandolina
of
chioggia
he
found
the
abbot
a
man
with
a
bland
intriguing
eye
and
centuries
of
pious
leisure
in
his
voice
he
received
his
visitors
in
a
room
hung
with
smoky
pictures
of
the
spanish
school
showing
saint
jerome
in
the
wilderness
the
death
of
saint
peter
martyr
and
other
sanguinary
passages
in
the
lives
of
the
saints
and
odo
seated
among
such
surroundings
and
hearing
the
abbot
deplore
the
loose
lives
and
religious
negligence
of
certain
members
of
the
court
could
scarce
repress
a
smile
as
the
thought
of
mirandolina
flitted
through
his
mind
she
must
he
reflected
have
found
this
a
sad
change
from
the
bishop
palace
and
admired
with
what
philosophy
she
had
passed
from
one
protector
to
the
other
life
in
pianura
after
the
first
few
weeks
seemed
on
the
whole
a
tame
business
to
a
youth
of
his
appetite
and
he
secretly
longed
for
a
pretext
to
resume
his
travels
none
however
seemed
likely
to
offer
for
it
was
clear
that
the
duke
in
the
interval
of
more
pressing
concerns
wished
to
study
and
observe
his
kinsman
when
sufficiently
recovered
from
the
effects
of
the
pilgrimage
he
sent
for
odo
and
questioned
him
closely
as
to
the
way
in
which
he
had
spent
his
time
since
coming
to
pianura
the
acquaintances
he
had
formed
and
the
churches
he
had
frequented
odo
prudently
dwelt
on
the
lofty
tone
of
the
belverde
circle
and
on
the
privilege
he
had
enjoyed
in
attending
her
on
a
visit
to
the
holy
abbot
of
the
barnabites
touching
more
lightly
on
his
connection
with
the
bishop
and
omitting
all
mention
of
gamba
and
crescenti
the
duke
assumed
a
listening
air
but
it
was
clear
that
he
could
not
put
off
his
private
thoughts
long
enough
to
give
an
open
mind
to
other
matters
and
odo
felt
that
he
was
nowhere
so
secure
as
in
his
cousin
company
he
remembered
however
that
the
duke
had
plenty
of
eyes
to
replace
his
own
and
that
a
secret
which
was
safe
in
his
actual
presence
might
be
in
mortal
danger
on
his
threshold
his
highness
on
this
occasion
was
pleased
to
inform
his
kinsman
that
he
had
ordered
count
trescorre
to
place
at
the
young
man
disposal
an
income
enabling
him
to
keep
a
carriage
and
pair
four
and
five
servants
it
was
scant
measure
for
an
and
odo
wondered
if
the
belverde
had
had
a
hand
in
the
apportionment
but
his
indifference
to
such
matters
for
though
personally
fastidious
he
cared
little
for
display
enabled
him
to
show
such
gratitude
that
the
duke
fancying
he
might
have
been
content
with
less
had
nearly
withdrawn
two
of
the
this
becoming
behaviour
greatly
advanced
the
young
man
in
the
esteem
of
his
highness
who
accorded
him
on
the
spot
the
petites
entrees
of
the
ducal
apartments
it
was
a
privilege
odo
had
no
mind
to
abuse
for
if
life
moved
slowly
in
the
belverde
circle
it
was
at
a
standstill
in
the
duke
his
highness
never
went
abroad
but
to
serve
mass
in
some
church
his
almost
daily
practice
or
to
visit
one
of
the
numerous
monasteries
within
the
city
from
ash
wednesday
to
easter
monday
it
was
his
custom
to
transact
no
public
or
private
business
during
this
time
he
received
none
of
his
ministers
and
saw
his
son
but
for
a
few
moments
once
a
day
while
in
holy
week
he
made
a
retreat
with
the
barnabites
the
belverde
withdrawing
for
the
same
period
to
the
convent
of
the
perpetual
adoration
odo
as
his
new
life
took
shape
found
his
chief
interest
in
the
society
of
crescenti
and
gamba
in
the
duchess
company
he
might
have
lost
all
taste
for
soberer
pleasures
but
that
his
political
sympathies
wore
a
girl
reproachful
shape
ever
at
his
side
more
vividly
than
in
the
body
fulvia
vivaldi
became
the
symbol
of
his
best
aims
and
deepest
failure
sometimes
indeed
her
look
drove
him
forth
in
the
train
but
more
often
drawing
him
from
the
crowd
of
beckoned
the
way
to
solitude
and
study
under
crescenti
tuition
he
began
the
reading
of
dante
who
just
then
after
generations
of
neglect
was
once
more
lifting
his
voice
above
the
crowd
of
minor
singers
the
mighty
verse
swept
odo
out
to
open
seas
of
thought
and
from
his
vision
of
that
earlier
italy
hapless
bleeding
but
alive
and
breast
to
breast
with
the
foe
he
drew
the
presage
of
his
country
resurrection
passing
from
this
high
music
to
the
company
of
gamba
and
his
friends
was
like
leaving
a
church
where
the
penitential
psalms
are
being
sung
for
the
where
mud
and
eggs
are
flying
the
change
was
not
agreeable
to
a
fastidious
taste
but
as
gamba
said
you
can
not
clean
out
a
stable
by
waving
incense
over
it
after
some
hesitation
he
had
agreed
to
make
odo
acquainted
with
those
who
like
himself
were
secretly
working
in
the
cause
of
progress
these
were
mostly
of
the
middle
class
physicians
lawyers
and
such
men
of
letters
as
could
subsist
on
the
scant
wants
of
an
unliterary
town
ablest
among
them
was
the
bookseller
andreoni
whose
shop
was
the
meeting
place
of
all
the
literati
of
pianura
andreoni
famous
throughout
italy
for
his
editions
of
the
classics
was
a
man
of
liberal
views
and
considerable
learning
and
in
his
private
room
were
to
be
found
many
prohibited
volumes
such
as
beccaria
crime
and
punishment
gravina
hydra
mystica
history
of
probabilism
and
the
amsterdam
editions
of
the
french
philosophical
works
the
reformers
met
at
various
places
and
their
meetings
were
conducted
with
as
much
secrecy
as
those
of
the
odo
was
at
first
surprised
that
they
should
admit
him
to
their
conferences
but
he
soon
divined
that
the
gatherings
he
attended
were
not
those
at
which
the
private
designs
of
the
party
were
discussed
it
was
plain
that
they
belonged
to
some
kind
of
secret
association
and
before
he
had
been
long
in
pianura
he
learned
that
the
society
of
the
illuminati
that
bugbear
of
priests
and
princes
was
supposed
to
have
agents
at
work
in
the
duchy
odo
had
heard
little
of
this
execrated
league
but
that
it
was
said
to
preach
atheism
tyrannicide
and
the
complete
abolition
of
territorial
rights
but
this
being
the
report
of
the
enemy
was
to
be
received
with
a
measure
of
doubt
he
tried
to
learn
from
gamba
whether
the
illuminati
had
a
lodge
in
the
city
but
on
this
point
he
could
extract
no
information
meanwhile
he
listened
with
interest
to
discussions
on
taxation
irrigation
and
such
economic
problems
as
might
safely
be
aired
in
his
presence
these
talks
brought
vividly
before
him
the
political
corruption
of
the
state
and
the
misery
of
the
unprivileged
classes
all
the
land
in
the
duchy
was
farmed
on
the
metayer
system
and
with
such
ill
results
that
the
peasants
were
always
in
debt
to
their
landlords
the
weight
of
the
evil
lay
chiefly
on
the
who
had
to
pay
on
every
pig
they
killed
on
all
the
produce
they
carried
to
market
on
their
farm
implements
their
and
their
to
say
nothing
of
the
tithes
to
the
parish
so
oppressive
were
these
obligations
that
many
of
the
peasants
forsaking
their
farms
enrolled
themselves
in
the
mendicant
orders
thus
actually
strengthening
the
hand
of
their
oppressors
of
legislative
redress
there
was
no
hope
and
the
duke
was
inaccessible
to
all
but
his
favourites
the
previous
year
as
odo
learned
eight
hundred
poor
labourers
exasperated
by
want
had
petitioned
his
highness
to
relieve
them
of
the
corvee
but
though
they
had
raised
fifteen
hundred
scudi
to
bribe
the
court
official
who
was
to
present
their
address
no
reply
had
ever
been
received
in
the
city
itself
the
monopoly
of
corn
and
tobacco
weighed
heavily
on
the
merchants
and
the
strict
censorship
of
the
press
made
the
open
ventilation
of
wrongs
impossible
while
the
duke
sbirri
and
the
agents
of
the
holy
office
could
drag
a
man
thoughts
from
his
bosom
and
search
his
midnight
dreams
the
church
party
in
the
interest
of
their
order
fostered
the
duke
fears
of
sedition
and
branded
every
innovator
as
an
atheist
the
holy
office
having
even
cast
grave
doubts
on
the
orthodoxy
of
a
nobleman
who
had
tried
to
introduce
the
english
system
of
ploughing
on
his
estates
it
was
evident
to
odo
that
the
secret
hopes
of
the
reformers
centred
in
him
and
the
consciousness
of
their
belief
was
sweeter
than
love
in
his
bosom
it
diverted
him
from
the
follies
of
his
class
fixed
his
thoughts
at
an
age
when
they
are
apt
to
range
and
thus
slowly
shaped
and
tempered
him
for
high
uses
in
this
fashion
the
weeks
passed
and
summer
came
it
was
the
habit
to
escape
the
august
heats
by
retiring
to
the
on
the
piana
a
league
beyond
the
gates
but
the
little
prince
being
still
under
the
care
of
the
german
physician
who
would
not
consent
to
his
removal
her
highness
reluctantly
lingered
in
pianura
with
the
first
leafing
of
the
oaks
odo
old
love
for
the
budding
earth
awoke
and
he
rode
out
daily
in
the
forest
toward
pontesordo
it
was
but
a
flat
stretch
of
shade
lacking
the
voice
of
streams
and
the
cold
breath
of
a
wood
without
humours
or
surprises
but
the
mere
spring
of
the
turf
was
delightful
as
he
cantered
down
the
grass
alleys
roofed
with
level
boughs
the
outer
sunlight
just
gilding
the
lip
of
the
long
green
tunnel
sometimes
he
attended
the
duchess
but
oftener
chose
to
ride
alone
setting
forth
early
after
a
night
at
cards
or
a
late
vigil
in
crescenti
study
one
of
these
solitary
rides
brought
him
without
premeditation
to
a
low
building
on
the
fenny
edge
of
the
wood
it
was
a
small
house
added
it
appeared
to
an
ancient
brick
front
adorned
with
pilasters
perhaps
a
fragment
of
some
woodland
temple
the
was
overgrown
with
a
stealthy
green
moss
and
tufted
with
giant
fennel
and
a
shutter
swinging
loose
on
its
hinge
gave
a
glimpse
of
inner
dimness
odo
guessed
at
once
that
this
was
the
hunting
lodge
where
cerveno
had
found
his
death
and
as
he
stood
looking
out
across
the
oozy
secrets
of
the
marsh
the
fever
seemed
to
hang
on
his
steps
he
turned
away
with
a
shiver
but
whether
it
were
the
sullen
aspect
of
the
house
or
the
close
way
in
which
the
wood
embraced
it
the
place
suddenly
laid
a
detaining
hand
upon
him
it
was
as
though
he
had
reached
the
heart
of
solitude
even
the
faint
woodland
noises
seemed
to
recede
from
that
dense
circle
of
shade
and
the
marsh
turned
a
dead
eye
to
heaven
odo
tethered
his
horse
to
a
bough
and
seated
himself
on
the
doorstep
but
presently
his
musings
were
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
duchess
attended
by
her
gentlemen
swept
by
at
the
end
of
a
long
glade
he
fancied
she
waved
her
hand
to
him
but
being
in
no
humour
to
join
the
cavalcade
he
remained
seated
and
the
riders
soon
passed
out
of
sight
as
he
sat
there
sombre
thoughts
came
to
him
stealing
up
like
exhalations
from
the
fen
he
saw
his
life
stretched
out
before
him
full
of
broken
purposes
and
ineffectual
effort
public
affairs
were
in
so
perplexed
a
case
that
consistent
action
seemed
impossible
to
either
party
and
their
chief
efforts
were
bent
toward
directing
the
choice
of
a
regent
it
was
this
rather
than
the
possibility
of
his
accession
which
fixed
the
general
attention
on
odo
and
pledged
him
to
circumspection
while
not
concealing
that
in
economic
questions
his
sympathies
were
with
the
liberals
he
had
carefully
abstained
from
political
action
and
had
hoped
by
the
strict
observance
of
his
religious
duties
to
avoid
the
enmity
of
the
church
party
undisguised
sympathy
seemed
the
pledge
of
liberal
support
and
it
could
hardly
be
doubted
that
the
choice
of
a
regent
in
the
church
party
would
be
unpopular
enough
to
imperil
the
dynasty
with
austria
hovering
on
the
horizon
the
church
herself
was
not
likely
to
take
such
risks
and
thus
all
interests
seemed
to
centre
in
odo
appointment
new
elements
of
uncertainty
were
however
perpetually
disturbing
the
prospect
among
these
was
heiligenstern
growing
influence
over
the
duke
odo
had
seen
little
of
the
german
physician
since
their
first
meeting
hearsay
had
it
that
he
was
by
the
spies
of
the
holy
office
and
perhaps
for
this
reason
he
remained
withdrawn
in
the
duke
private
apartments
and
rarely
showed
himself
abroad
the
little
prince
his
patient
was
as
seldom
seen
and
the
accounts
of
the
german
treatment
were
as
conflicting
as
the
other
rumours
of
the
court
it
was
noised
on
all
sides
however
that
the
duke
was
with
the
results
of
the
pilgrimage
and
resolved
upon
less
hallowed
measures
to
assure
his
heir
recovery
hitherto
it
was
believed
the
german
had
conformed
to
the
ordinary
medical
treatment
but
the
clergy
now
diligently
spread
among
the
people
the
report
that
supernatural
agencies
were
to
be
employed
this
rumour
caused
such
general
agitation
that
it
was
said
both
parties
had
made
secret
advances
to
the
duchess
in
the
hope
of
inducing
her
to
stay
the
scandal
though
maria
clementina
felt
little
real
concern
for
the
public
welfare
her
stirring
temper
had
more
than
once
roused
her
to
active
opposition
of
the
government
and
her
kinship
with
the
old
duke
of
monte
alloro
made
her
a
strong
factor
in
the
political
game
of
late
however
she
seemed
to
have
wearied
of
this
sport
throwing
herself
entirely
into
the
private
diversions
of
her
station
and
alluding
with
laughing
indifference
to
her
husband
necromantic
researches
such
was
the
conflicting
gossip
of
the
hour
but
it
was
in
fact
idle
to
forecast
the
fortunes
of
a
state
dependent
on
a
valetudinary
whims
and
rumour
was
driven
to
feed
upon
her
own
conjectures
to
odo
the
state
of
affairs
seemed
a
satire
on
his
secret
aspirations
in
a
private
station
or
as
a
ruling
prince
he
might
have
served
his
fellows
as
a
princeling
on
the
edge
of
power
he
was
no
more
than
the
cardboard
sword
in
a
toy
armoury
suddenly
he
heard
his
name
pronounced
and
starting
up
saw
maria
clementina
at
his
side
she
rode
alone
and
held
out
her
hand
as
he
approached
i
have
had
an
accident
said
she
breathing
quickly
my
girth
is
broke
and
i
have
lost
the
rest
of
my
company
she
was
glowing
with
her
quick
ride
and
as
odo
lifted
her
from
the
saddle
her
loosened
hair
brushed
his
face
like
a
kiss
for
a
moment
she
seemed
like
life
answer
to
the
dreary
riddle
of
his
fate
ah
she
sighed
leaning
on
him
i
am
glad
i
found
you
cousin
i
hardly
knew
how
weary
i
was
and
she
dropped
languidly
to
the
doorstep
odo
heart
was
beating
hard
he
knew
it
was
only
the
stir
of
the
spring
sap
in
his
veins
but
maria
clementina
wore
a
look
of
morning
brightness
that
might
have
made
a
soberer
judgment
blink
he
turned
away
to
examine
her
saddle
as
he
did
so
he
observed
that
her
girth
was
not
torn
but
clean
cut
as
with
sharp
scissors
he
glanced
up
in
surprise
but
she
sat
with
drooping
lids
her
head
thrown
back
against
the
lintel
and
repressing
the
question
on
his
lips
he
busied
himself
with
the
adjustment
of
the
saddle
when
it
was
in
place
he
turned
to
give
her
a
hand
but
she
only
smiled
up
at
him
through
her
lashes
what
said
she
with
an
air
of
lovely
lassitude
are
you
so
impatient
to
be
rid
of
me
i
should
have
been
so
glad
to
linger
here
a
little
she
put
her
hand
in
his
and
let
him
lift
her
to
her
feet
how
cool
and
still
it
is
look
at
that
little
spring
bubbling
through
the
moss
could
you
not
fetch
me
a
drink
from
it
she
tossed
aside
her
and
pushed
back
the
hair
from
her
warm
forehead
your
highness
must
not
drink
of
the
water
here
said
odo
releasing
her
hand
she
gave
him
a
quick
derisive
glance
ah
true
she
cried
this
is
the
house
to
which
that
abandoned
wretch
used
to
lure
poor
cerveno
she
drew
back
to
look
at
the
lodge
were
you
ever
in
it
she
asked
curiously
i
should
like
to
see
how
the
place
looks
she
laid
her
hand
on
the
and
to
odo
surprise
it
yielded
to
her
touch
we
in
luck
i
vow
she
declared
with
a
laugh
come
cousin
let
us
visit
the
temple
of
romance
together
the
allusion
to
cerveno
jarred
on
odo
and
he
followed
her
in
silence
within
doors
the
lodge
was
seen
to
consist
of
a
single
room
gaily
painted
with
framed
in
garlands
of
stucco
in
the
dusk
they
could
just
discern
the
outlines
of
carved
and
gilded
furniture
and
a
venice
mirror
gave
back
their
faces
like
phantoms
in
a
magic
crystal
this
is
stifling
said
odo
impatiently
would
your
highness
not
be
better
in
the
open
no
no
she
persisted
unbar
the
shutters
and
we
shall
have
air
enough
i
love
a
deserted
house
i
have
always
fancied
that
if
one
came
in
noiselessly
enough
one
might
catch
the
ghosts
of
the
people
who
used
to
live
in
it
he
obeyed
in
silence
and
the
forest
noon
filled
the
room
with
a
quiver
of
light
a
chill
stole
upon
odo
as
he
looked
at
the
furniture
the
painted
harpsichord
with
green
mould
creeping
over
its
keyboard
the
consoles
set
with
empty
wine
flagons
and
goblets
of
venice
glass
the
place
was
like
the
abandoned
corpse
of
pleasure
but
maria
clementina
laughed
and
clapped
her
hands
this
is
enchanting
she
cried
throwing
herself
into
an
of
threadbare
damask
and
i
shall
rest
here
while
you
refresh
me
with
a
glass
of
lacrima
christi
from
one
of
those
dusty
flagons
they
are
empty
you
say
never
mind
for
i
have
a
flask
of
cordial
in
my
fetch
it
cousin
and
wash
these
two
glasses
in
the
spring
that
we
may
toast
all
the
dead
lovers
that
have
drunk
out
of
them
when
odo
returned
with
the
flask
and
glasses
she
had
brushed
the
dust
from
a
slender
table
of
inlaid
wood
and
drawn
a
seat
near
her
own
she
filled
the
two
goblets
with
cordial
and
signed
to
odo
to
seat
himself
beside
her
why
do
you
pull
such
a
glum
face
she
cried
leaning
over
to
touch
his
glass
before
she
emptied
hers
is
it
that
you
are
thinking
of
poor
cerveno
on
my
soul
i
question
if
he
needs
your
pity
he
had
his
hour
of
folly
and
was
too
gallant
a
gentleman
not
to
pay
the
shot
for
my
part
i
would
rather
drink
a
poisoned
draught
than
die
of
thirst
the
wine
was
rising
in
waves
of
colour
over
her
throat
and
brow
and
setting
her
glass
down
she
suddenly
laid
her
ungloved
hand
on
odo
cousin
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
could
help
you
if
you
would
let
me
help
me
he
said
only
of
her
words
in
the
warm
surprise
of
her
touch
she
drew
back
but
with
a
look
that
seemed
to
leave
her
hand
in
his
are
you
mad
she
murmured
or
do
you
despise
your
danger
am
i
in
danger
he
echoed
smiling
he
was
thinking
how
easily
a
man
might
go
under
in
that
deep
blue
gaze
of
hers
she
dropped
her
lids
as
though
aware
of
his
thought
why
do
you
concern
yourself
with
politics
she
went
on
with
a
new
note
in
her
voice
can
you
find
no
diversion
more
suited
to
your
rank
and
age
our
court
is
a
dull
one
i
own
but
surely
even
here
a
man
might
find
a
better
use
for
his
time
odo
returned
in
a
flash
i
am
not
cried
he
gaily
in
a
position
to
dispute
it
at
this
moment
and
he
leaned
over
to
recapture
her
hand
to
his
surprise
she
freed
herself
with
an
affronted
air
ah
she
said
you
think
this
a
device
to
provoke
a
gallant
conversation
she
faced
him
nobly
now
look
said
she
drawing
a
folded
paper
from
the
breast
of
her
have
you
not
frequented
these
houses
suddenly
sobered
he
ran
his
eye
over
the
paper
it
contained
the
dates
of
the
meetings
he
had
attended
at
the
houses
of
gamba
friends
with
the
designation
of
each
house
he
turned
pale
i
had
no
notion
said
he
with
a
smile
that
my
movements
were
of
interest
in
such
high
places
but
why
does
your
highness
speak
of
danger
in
this
connection
because
it
is
rumoured
that
the
lodge
of
the
illuminati
which
is
known
to
exist
in
pianura
meets
secretly
at
the
houses
on
this
list
odo
hesitated
a
moment
of
that
said
he
i
have
no
report
i
am
acquainted
with
the
houses
only
as
the
residences
of
certain
learned
and
reputable
men
who
devote
their
leisure
to
scientific
studies
oh
she
interrupted
call
them
by
what
name
you
please
it
is
all
one
to
your
enemies
my
enemies
said
he
lightly
and
who
are
they
who
are
they
she
repeated
impatiently
who
are
they
not
who
is
there
at
court
that
has
such
cause
to
love
you
the
holy
office
the
duke
party
odo
smiled
i
am
perhaps
not
in
the
best
odour
with
the
church
party
said
he
but
count
trescorre
has
shown
himself
my
friend
and
i
think
my
character
is
safe
in
his
keeping
nor
will
it
be
any
news
to
him
that
i
frequent
the
company
you
name
she
threw
back
her
head
with
a
laugh
boy
she
cried
you
are
blinder
even
than
i
fancied
do
you
know
why
it
was
that
the
duke
summoned
you
to
pianura
because
he
wished
his
party
to
mould
you
to
their
shape
in
case
the
regency
should
fall
into
your
hands
and
what
has
trescorre
done
shown
himself
your
friend
as
you
say
won
your
confidence
encouraged
you
to
air
your
liberal
views
allowed
you
to
show
yourself
continually
in
the
bishop
company
and
to
frequent
the
secret
assemblies
of
free
thinkers
and
conspirators
and
all
that
the
duke
may
turn
against
you
and
perhaps
name
him
regent
in
your
stead
believe
me
cousin
she
cried
with
a
mounting
urgency
you
never
stood
in
greater
need
of
a
friend
than
now
if
you
continue
on
your
present
course
you
are
undone
the
church
party
is
resolved
to
hunt
down
the
illuminati
and
both
sides
would
rejoice
to
see
you
made
the
scapegoat
of
the
holy
office
she
sprung
up
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
what
can
i
do
to
convince
you
she
said
passionately
will
you
believe
me
if
i
ask
you
to
go
away
to
leave
pianura
on
the
instant
odo
had
risen
also
and
they
faced
each
other
in
silence
there
was
an
unmistakable
meaning
in
her
tone
a
so
simple
and
ennobling
that
she
seemed
to
give
herself
as
hostage
for
her
words
ask
me
to
stay
cousin
not
to
go
he
whispered
her
yielding
hand
in
his
ah
madman
she
cried
not
to
believe
me
now
but
it
is
not
too
late
if
you
will
still
be
guided
i
will
be
guided
but
not
away
from
you
she
broke
away
but
with
a
glance
that
drew
him
after
it
is
late
now
and
we
must
set
forward
she
said
abruptly
come
to
me
tomorrow
early
i
have
much
more
to
say
to
you
the
words
seemed
to
be
driven
out
on
her
quick
breathing
and
the
blood
came
and
went
in
her
cheek
like
a
hurried
messenger
she
caught
up
her
and
turned
to
put
it
on
before
the
venice
mirror
odo
stepping
up
behind
her
looked
over
her
shoulder
to
catch
the
reflection
of
her
blush
their
eyes
met
for
a
laughing
instant
then
he
drew
back
deadly
pale
for
in
the
depths
of
the
dim
mirror
he
had
seen
another
face
the
duchess
cried
out
and
glanced
behind
her
who
was
it
did
you
see
her
she
said
trembling
odo
mastered
himself
instantly
i
saw
nothing
he
returned
quietly
what
can
your
highness
mean
she
covered
her
eyes
with
her
hands
a
girl
face
she
shuddered
there
in
the
mirror
behind
mine
a
pale
face
with
a
black
travelling
hood
over
it
he
gathered
up
her
gloves
and
and
threw
open
the
door
of
the
pavilion
your
highness
is
weary
and
the
air
here
insalubrious
shall
we
not
ride
he
said
maria
clementina
heard
him
with
a
blank
stare
suddenly
she
roused
herself
and
made
as
though
to
pass
out
but
on
the
threshold
she
snatched
her
whip
from
him
and
turning
flung
it
full
at
the
mirror
her
aim
was
good
and
the
chiselled
handle
of
the
whip
shattered
the
glass
to
fragments
she
caught
up
her
long
skirt
and
stepped
into
the
open
i
brook
no
rivals
said
she
with
a
smile
and
now
cousin
she
added
gaily
to
horse
odo
as
in
duty
bound
waited
the
next
morning
on
the
duchess
but
word
was
brought
that
her
highness
was
indisposed
and
could
not
receive
him
till
evening
he
passed
a
drifting
and
distracted
day
the
fear
lay
much
upon
him
that
danger
threatened
gamba
and
his
associates
yet
to
seek
them
out
in
the
present
conjuncture
might
be
to
play
the
to
their
enemies
moreover
he
fancied
the
duchess
not
incapable
of
using
political
rumours
to
further
her
private
caprice
and
scenting
no
immediate
danger
he
resolved
to
wait
upon
events
on
rising
from
dinner
he
was
surprised
by
a
summons
from
the
duke
the
message
an
unusual
one
at
that
hour
was
brought
by
a
slender
pale
lad
not
in
his
highness
service
but
in
that
of
the
german
physician
heiligenstern
the
boy
who
was
said
to
be
a
georgian
rescued
from
the
grand
signior
galleys
and
whose
small
oval
face
was
as
smooth
as
a
girl
accosted
odo
in
one
of
the
remoter
garden
alleys
with
the
request
to
follow
him
at
once
to
the
duke
apartment
odo
complied
and
his
guide
loitered
ahead
with
an
air
of
unconcern
as
though
not
wishing
to
have
his
errand
guessed
as
they
passed
through
the
tapestry
gallery
preceding
the
gentlemen
antechamber
footsteps
and
voices
were
heard
within
instantly
the
boy
was
by
odo
side
and
had
drawn
him
into
the
embrasure
of
a
window
a
moment
later
trescorre
left
the
antechamber
and
walked
rapidly
past
their
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
sight
the
georgian
led
odo
from
his
concealment
and
introduced
him
by
a
private
way
to
the
duke
closet
his
highness
was
in
his
and
odo
on
being
admitted
found
him
still
in
and
kneeling
with
a
disordered
countenance
before
the
ancient
picture
of
the
last
judgment
that
hung
on
the
wall
facing
his
bed
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
he
had
asked
for
his
kinsman
for
on
the
latter
entrance
he
started
up
with
a
suspicious
glance
and
hastily
closed
the
panels
of
the
picture
which
as
odo
now
noticed
appeared
to
conceal
an
inner
painting
then
gathering
his
about
him
he
led
the
way
to
his
closet
and
bade
his
visitor
be
seated
i
have
said
he
speaking
in
a
low
voice
and
glancing
apprehensively
about
him
summoned
you
hither
privately
to
speak
on
a
subject
which
concerns
none
but
you
met
no
one
on
your
way
he
broke
off
to
enquire
odo
told
him
that
count
trescorre
had
passed
but
without
perceiving
him
the
duke
seemed
relieved
my
private
actions
said
he
querulously
are
too
jealously
spied
upon
by
my
ministers
such
surveillance
is
an
offence
to
my
authority
and
my
subjects
shall
learn
that
it
will
not
frighten
me
from
my
course
he
straightened
his
bent
shoulders
and
tried
to
put
on
the
majestic
look
of
his
official
effigy
it
appears
he
continued
with
one
of
his
sudden
changes
of
manner
that
the
duchess
uncle
the
duke
of
monte
alloro
has
heard
favourable
reports
of
your
wit
and
accomplishments
and
is
desirous
of
receiving
you
at
his
court
he
paused
and
odo
concealed
his
surprise
behind
a
profound
bow
i
own
the
duke
went
on
that
the
invitation
comes
unseasonably
since
i
should
have
preferred
to
keep
you
at
my
side
but
his
great
age
and
his
close
kinship
to
my
wife
through
whom
the
request
is
conveyed
make
it
impossible
for
me
to
refuse
the
duke
again
paused
as
though
uncertain
how
to
proceed
at
length
he
resumed
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
his
highness
is
subject
to
the
fantastical
humours
of
his
age
he
makes
it
a
condition
that
the
length
of
your
stay
shall
not
be
limited
but
should
you
fail
to
suit
his
mood
you
may
find
yourself
out
of
favour
in
a
week
he
writes
of
wishing
to
send
you
on
a
private
mission
to
the
court
of
naples
but
this
may
be
no
more
than
a
passing
whim
i
see
no
way
however
but
to
let
you
go
and
to
hope
for
a
favourable
welcome
for
you
the
duchess
is
determined
upon
giving
her
uncle
this
pleasure
and
in
fact
has
consented
in
return
to
oblige
me
in
an
important
matter
he
flushed
and
averted
his
eyes
i
name
this
he
added
with
an
effort
only
that
her
highness
may
be
aware
that
it
depends
on
herself
whether
i
hold
to
my
side
of
the
bargain
your
papers
are
already
prepared
and
you
have
my
permission
to
set
out
at
your
convenience
meanwhile
it
were
well
that
you
should
keep
your
preparations
private
at
least
till
you
are
ready
to
take
leave
and
with
the
air
of
dignity
he
could
still
assume
on
occasion
he
rose
and
handed
odo
his
passport
odo
left
the
closet
with
a
beating
heart
it
was
clear
that
his
departure
from
pianura
was
as
strongly
opposed
by
some
one
in
high
authority
as
it
was
favoured
by
the
duchess
and
why
opposed
and
by
whom
he
could
not
so
much
as
hazard
a
guess
in
the
web
of
court
intrigues
it
was
difficult
for
the
wariest
to
grope
his
way
and
odo
was
still
new
to
such
entanglements
his
first
sensation
was
one
of
release
of
a
future
suddenly
enlarged
and
cleared
the
door
was
open
again
to
opportunity
and
he
was
of
an
age
to
greet
the
unexpected
like
a
bride
only
one
thought
disturbed
him
it
was
clear
that
maria
clementina
had
paid
high
for
his
security
and
did
not
her
sacrifice
whatever
its
nature
constitute
a
claim
upon
his
future
in
sending
him
to
her
uncle
whose
known
favourite
she
was
she
did
not
let
him
out
of
her
hand
if
he
accepted
this
chance
of
escape
he
must
hereafter
come
and
go
as
she
bade
at
the
thought
his
bounding
fancy
slunk
back
humbled
he
saw
himself
as
trescorre
successor
his
sovereign
official
lover
taking
up
again
under
more
difficult
circumstances
and
without
the
zest
of
inexperience
the
dull
routine
of
his
former
bondage
no
a
thousand
times
no
he
would
fetter
himself
to
no
woman
fancy
better
find
a
pretext
for
staying
in
pianura
affront
the
duchess
by
refusing
her
aid
risk
his
prospects
his
life
even
than
bow
his
neck
twice
to
the
same
yoke
all
her
charm
vanished
in
this
vision
of
unwilling
subjection
disturbed
by
these
considerations
and
anxious
to
compose
his
spirits
odo
bethought
himself
of
taking
refuge
in
the
company
here
at
least
the
atmosphere
was
clear
of
mystery
the
bishop
held
aloof
from
political
intrigue
and
breathed
an
air
untainted
by
the
odium
theologicum
odo
found
his
lordship
seated
in
the
cool
tessellated
saloon
which
contained
his
chiefest
treasures
marble
busts
ranged
on
pedestals
between
the
windows
the
bronze
venus
callipyge
and
various
tables
of
pietra
commessa
set
out
with
vases
and
tazzas
of
antique
pattern
a
knot
of
virtuosi
gathered
about
one
of
these
tables
were
engaged
in
examining
a
collection
of
engraved
gems
displayed
by
a
lapidary
of
florence
while
others
inspected
a
greek
manuscript
which
the
bishop
had
lately
received
from
syria
beyond
the
windows
a
cedrario
or
stretched
its
sunlit
vista
to
the
terrace
above
the
river
and
the
black
cassocks
of
one
or
two
priests
who
were
strolling
in
the
clear
green
shade
of
a
pleached
alley
made
pleasant
spots
of
dimness
in
the
scene
even
here
however
odo
was
aware
of
a
certain
disquietude
the
visitors
instead
of
engaging
in
animated
disputations
over
his
lordship
treasures
showed
a
disposition
to
walk
apart
conversing
in
low
tones
and
he
himself
presently
complaining
of
the
heat
invited
odo
to
accompany
him
to
the
grot
beneath
the
terrace
in
this
shaded
retreat
studded
with
shells
and
coral
and
cooled
by
an
artificial
wind
forced
through
the
conchs
of
marble
tritons
his
lordship
at
once
began
to
speak
of
the
rumours
of
public
disaffection
as
you
know
said
he
my
duties
and
tastes
alike
seclude
me
from
political
intrigue
and
the
scandal
of
the
day
seldom
travels
beyond
my
kitchens
but
as
creaking
signboards
announce
a
storm
the
hints
and
whispers
of
my
household
tell
me
there
is
mischief
abroad
my
position
protects
me
from
personal
risk
and
my
lack
of
ambition
from
political
enmity
for
it
is
notorious
i
would
barter
the
highest
honours
in
the
state
for
a
greek
vase
or
a
bronze
of
herculanaeum
not
to
mention
the
famous
venus
of
giorgione
which
if
report
be
true
his
highness
has
burned
at
father
ignazio
instigation
but
yours
cavaliere
is
a
less
sheltered
walk
and
perhaps
a
friendly
warning
may
be
of
service
yet
he
added
after
a
pause
a
warning
i
can
scarce
call
it
since
i
know
not
from
what
quarter
the
danger
impends
proximus
ardet
ucalegon
but
there
is
no
telling
which
way
the
flames
may
spread
i
can
only
advise
you
that
the
duke
growing
infatuation
for
his
german
magician
has
bred
the
most
violent
discontent
among
his
subjects
and
that
both
parties
appear
resolved
to
use
this
disaffection
to
their
advantage
it
is
said
his
highness
intends
to
subject
the
little
prince
to
some
mysterious
treatment
connected
with
the
rites
of
the
egyptian
priesthood
of
whose
secret
doctrine
heiligenstern
pretends
to
be
an
adept
yesterday
it
was
bruited
that
the
duchess
loudly
opposed
the
experiment
this
afternoon
it
is
given
out
that
she
has
yielded
what
the
result
may
be
none
can
foresee
but
whichever
way
the
storm
blows
the
chief
danger
probably
threatens
those
who
have
had
any
connection
with
the
secret
societies
known
to
exist
in
the
duchy
odo
listened
attentively
but
without
betraying
any
great
surprise
and
the
bishop
evidently
reassured
by
his
composure
suggested
that
the
heat
of
the
day
having
declined
they
should
visit
the
new
indian
pheasants
in
his
volary
the
bishop
hints
had
not
helped
his
listener
to
a
decision
odo
indeed
gave
cantapresto
orders
to
prepare
as
privately
as
possible
for
their
departure
but
rather
to
appear
to
be
carrying
out
the
instructions
than
with
any
fixed
intention
of
so
doing
how
to
find
a
pretext
for
remaining
he
was
yet
uncertain
to
disobey
the
duke
was
impossible
but
in
the
general
state
of
tension
it
seemed
likely
enough
that
both
his
highness
and
the
duchess
might
change
their
minds
within
the
next
hours
he
was
reluctant
to
appear
that
evening
in
the
duchess
circle
but
the
command
was
not
to
be
evaded
and
he
went
thither
resolved
to
excuse
himself
early
he
found
her
highness
surrounded
by
the
usual
rout
that
attended
her
she
was
herself
in
a
mood
of
wild
mirth
occasioned
by
the
drolleries
of
an
automatic
female
figure
which
a
travelling
showman
introduced
by
cantapresto
had
obtained
leave
to
display
at
court
this
lively
puppet
performed
with
surprising
skill
on
the
harpsichord
giving
the
company
among
other
novelties
selections
from
the
maestro
piccini
latest
opera
and
a
concerto
of
the
german
composer
gluck
maria
clementina
seemed
at
first
unaware
of
her
kinsman
presence
and
he
began
to
hope
he
might
avoid
any
private
talk
with
her
but
when
the
automaton
had
been
dismissed
and
the
were
preparing
one
of
her
gentlemen
summoned
him
to
her
side
as
usual
she
was
highly
rouged
in
the
french
fashion
and
her
cold
blue
eyes
had
a
light
which
set
off
the
extraordinary
fairness
of
her
skin
cousin
said
she
at
once
have
you
your
papers
her
tone
was
haughty
and
yet
eager
as
though
she
scorned
to
show
herself
concerned
yet
would
not
have
had
him
believe
in
her
indifference
odo
bowed
without
speaking
and
when
do
you
set
out
she
continued
my
good
uncle
is
impatient
to
receive
you
at
the
earliest
moment
madam
he
replied
with
some
hesitation
the
hesitation
was
not
lost
on
her
and
he
saw
her
flush
through
her
rouge
ah
said
she
in
a
low
voice
the
earliest
moment
is
none
too
early
do
you
go
tomorrow
she
persisted
but
just
then
trescorre
advanced
toward
them
and
under
a
burst
of
assumed
merriment
she
privately
signed
to
odo
to
withdraw
he
was
glad
to
make
his
escape
for
the
sense
of
walking
among
hidden
pitfalls
was
growing
on
him
that
he
had
acquitted
himself
awkwardly
with
the
duchess
he
was
well
aware
but
trescorre
interruption
had
at
least
enabled
him
to
gain
time
an
increasing
unwillingness
to
leave
pianura
had
replaced
his
former
impatience
to
be
gone
the
reluctance
to
desert
his
friends
was
coupled
with
a
boyish
desire
to
stay
and
see
the
game
out
and
behind
all
his
other
impulses
lurked
the
instinctive
resistance
to
any
feminine
influence
save
one
the
next
morning
he
another
message
from
the
duchess
but
none
came
and
he
judged
her
to
be
gravely
offended
cantapresto
appeared
early
with
the
rumour
that
some
kind
of
magical
ceremony
was
to
be
performed
that
evening
in
the
palace
and
toward
noon
the
georgian
boy
again
came
privately
to
odo
and
requested
him
to
wait
on
the
duke
when
his
highness
rose
from
supper
this
increased
odo
fears
for
gamba
andreoni
and
the
other
reformers
yet
he
dared
neither
seek
them
out
in
person
nor
entrust
a
message
to
cantapresto
as
the
day
passed
however
he
began
to
throw
off
his
apprehensions
it
was
not
the
first
time
since
he
had
come
to
pianura
that
there
had
been
ominous
talk
of
political
disturbances
and
he
knew
that
gamba
and
his
friends
were
not
without
means
of
getting
under
shelter
as
to
his
own
risk
he
did
not
give
it
a
thought
he
was
not
of
an
age
or
a
temper
to
weigh
personal
danger
against
the
excitement
of
conflict
and
as
evening
drew
on
he
found
himself
wondering
with
some
impatience
if
after
all
nothing
unusual
would
happen
he
supped
alone
and
at
the
appointed
hour
proceeded
to
the
apartments
taking
no
farther
precaution
than
to
carry
his
passport
about
him
the
palace
seemed
deserted
everywhere
an
air
of
apprehension
and
mystery
hung
over
the
long
corridors
and
antechambers
the
day
had
been
sultry
with
a
low
sky
foreboding
great
heat
and
not
a
breath
of
air
entered
at
the
windows
there
were
few
persons
about
but
one
or
two
beggars
lurked
as
usual
on
the
landings
of
the
great
staircase
and
odo
in
passing
felt
his
sleeve
touched
by
a
woman
cowering
under
the
marble
ramp
in
the
shadow
thrown
by
a
colossal
caesar
looking
down
he
heard
a
voice
beg
for
alms
and
as
he
gave
it
the
woman
pressed
a
paper
into
his
hand
and
slipped
away
through
the
darkness
odo
hastened
on
till
he
could
assure
himself
of
being
unobserved
then
he
unfolded
the
paper
and
read
these
words
in
gamba
hand
have
no
fear
for
any
one
safety
but
your
own
with
a
sense
of
relief
he
hid
the
message
and
entered
the
duke
antechamber
here
he
was
received
by
heiligenstern
oriental
servant
who
with
a
mute
salutation
led
him
into
a
large
room
where
the
duke
pages
usually
waited
the
walls
of
this
apartment
had
been
concealed
under
hangings
of
black
silk
worked
with
cabalistic
devices
set
on
tripods
of
antique
design
shed
a
faint
light
over
the
company
seated
at
one
end
of
the
room
among
whom
odo
recognised
the
chief
dignitaries
of
the
court
the
ladies
looked
pale
but
curious
the
men
for
the
most
part
indifferent
or
disapproving
intense
quietness
prevailed
broken
only
by
the
soft
opening
and
closing
of
the
door
through
which
the
guests
were
admitted
presently
the
duke
and
duchess
emerged
from
his
closet
they
were
followed
by
prince
ferrante
supported
by
his
governor
and
his
dwarf
and
robed
in
a
silken
which
hung
in
voluminous
folds
about
his
little
shrunken
body
their
highnesses
seated
themselves
in
two
armchairs
in
front
of
the
court
and
the
little
prince
reclined
beside
his
mother
no
sooner
had
they
taken
their
places
than
heiligenstern
stepped
forth
wearing
a
doctor
gown
and
a
bonnet
or
mitre
in
his
long
robes
and
strange
headdress
he
looked
extraordinarily
tall
and
pale
and
his
features
had
the
fixity
of
an
ancient
mask
he
was
followed
by
his
two
attendants
the
oriental
carrying
a
of
polished
metal
not
unlike
a
low
narrow
bed
which
he
set
down
in
the
middle
of
the
room
while
the
georgian
lad
who
had
exchanged
his
fustanella
and
embroidered
jacket
for
a
flowing
white
robe
bore
in
his
hands
a
crystal
globe
set
in
a
gold
stand
having
reverently
placed
it
on
a
small
table
the
boy
at
a
signal
from
his
master
drew
forth
a
phial
and
dropped
its
contents
into
a
bronze
vat
or
brazier
which
stood
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
instantly
clouds
of
perfumed
vapour
filled
the
air
and
as
these
dispersed
it
was
seen
that
the
black
hangings
of
the
walls
had
vanished
with
them
and
the
spectators
found
themselves
seated
in
a
kind
of
open
temple
through
which
the
eye
travelled
down
colonnaded
vistas
set
with
statues
and
fountains
this
magical
prospect
was
bathed
in
sunlight
and
odo
observed
that
though
the
lamps
had
gone
out
the
same
brightness
suffused
the
room
and
illuminated
the
wondering
faces
of
the
audience
the
little
prince
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
and
the
magician
stepped
forward
raising
a
long
white
wand
in
his
hand
this
said
he
in
measured
accents
is
an
evocation
of
the
temple
of
health
into
whose
blissful
precincts
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
was
able
to
lead
the
sufferer
who
put
his
trust
in
them
this
deceptio
visus
or
product
of
rhabdomancy
easily
effected
by
an
adept
of
the
egyptian
mysteries
is
designed
but
to
prefigure
the
reality
which
awaits
those
who
seek
health
through
the
ministry
of
the
disciples
of
iamblichus
it
is
no
longer
denied
among
men
of
learning
that
those
who
have
been
instructed
in
the
secret
doctrine
of
the
ancients
are
able
by
certain
correspondences
of
nature
revealed
only
to
the
initiated
to
act
on
the
inanimate
world
about
them
and
on
the
animal
economy
by
means
beyond
the
common
capabilities
of
man
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
turning
with
a
low
bow
to
the
duke
enquired
whether
his
highness
desired
the
rites
to
proceed
the
duke
signed
his
assent
and
heiligenstern
raising
his
wand
evoked
another
volume
of
mist
this
time
it
was
shot
through
with
green
flames
and
as
the
wild
light
subsided
the
room
was
once
more
revealed
with
its
black
hangings
and
the
lamps
flickered
into
life
again
after
another
pause
doubtless
intended
to
increase
the
tension
of
the
spectators
the
magician
bade
his
servant
place
the
crystal
before
him
he
then
raised
his
hands
as
if
in
prayer
speaking
in
a
strange
chanting
jargon
in
which
odo
detected
fragments
of
greek
and
latin
and
the
recurring
names
of
the
judaic
demons
and
angels
as
this
ceased
heiligenstern
beckoned
to
the
georgian
boy
who
approached
him
with
bowed
head
and
reverently
folded
hands
your
highness
said
heiligenstern
and
this
distinguished
company
are
doubtless
familiar
with
the
magic
crystal
of
the
ancients
in
which
the
future
may
be
deciphered
by
the
pure
in
heart
this
lad
whom
i
rescued
from
slavery
and
have
bred
to
my
service
in
the
solemn
rites
of
the
priesthood
of
isis
is
as
clear
in
spirit
as
the
crystal
which
stands
before
you
the
future
lies
open
to
him
in
this
translucent
sphere
and
he
is
prepared
to
disclose
it
at
your
bidding
there
was
a
moment
silence
but
on
the
magician
repeating
his
enquiry
the
duke
said
let
the
boy
tell
me
what
he
sees
heiligenstern
at
once
laid
his
hands
on
his
acolyte
head
and
murmured
a
few
words
over
him
then
the
boy
advanced
and
bent
devoutly
above
the
crystal
almost
immediately
the
globe
was
seen
to
cloud
as
though
suffused
with
milk
the
cloud
gradually
faded
and
the
boy
began
to
speak
in
a
low
hesitating
tone
i
see
he
said
i
see
a
face
a
fair
face
he
faltered
and
glanced
up
almost
apprehensively
at
heiligenstern
whose
gaze
remained
impenetrable
the
boy
began
to
tremble
i
see
nothing
he
said
in
a
whisper
there
is
one
here
purer
than
i
the
crystal
will
not
speak
for
me
in
that
other
presence
who
is
that
other
heiligenstern
asked
the
boy
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
little
prince
an
excited
murmur
ran
through
the
company
and
heiligenstern
again
advanced
to
the
duke
will
your
highness
he
asked
permit
the
prince
to
look
into
the
sacred
sphere
odo
saw
the
duchess
extend
her
hand
impulsively
toward
the
child
but
at
a
signal
from
the
duke
the
little
prince
chair
was
carried
to
the
table
on
which
the
crystal
stood
instantly
the
former
phenomenon
was
repeated
the
globe
clouding
and
then
clearing
itself
like
a
pool
after
rain
speak
my
son
said
the
duke
tell
us
what
the
heavenly
powers
reveal
to
you
the
little
prince
continued
to
pore
over
the
globe
without
speaking
suddenly
his
thin
face
reddened
and
he
clung
more
closely
to
his
companion
arm
i
see
a
beautiful
place
he
began
his
small
fluting
voice
rising
like
a
bird
pipe
in
the
stillness
a
place
a
thousand
times
more
beautiful
than
this
like
a
garden
full
of
children
with
beautiful
strange
toys
in
their
hands
they
have
wings
like
birds
they
are
birds
ah
they
are
flying
away
from
me
i
see
them
no
more
they
vanish
through
the
trees
he
broke
off
sadly
heiligenstern
smiled
that
your
highness
is
a
vision
of
the
own
future
when
restored
to
health
he
is
able
to
disport
himself
with
his
playmates
in
the
gardens
of
the
palace
but
they
were
not
the
gardens
of
the
palace
the
little
boy
exclaimed
they
were
much
more
beautiful
than
our
gardens
heiligenstern
bowed
they
appeared
so
to
your
highness
he
deferentially
suggested
because
all
the
world
seems
more
beautiful
to
those
who
have
regained
their
health
enough
my
son
exclaimed
the
duchess
with
a
shaken
voice
why
will
you
weary
the
child
she
continued
turning
to
the
duke
and
the
latter
with
evident
reluctance
signed
to
heiligenstern
to
cover
the
crystal
to
the
general
surprise
however
prince
ferrante
pushed
back
the
black
velvet
covering
which
the
georgian
boy
was
preparing
to
throw
over
it
no
no
he
exclaimed
in
the
high
obstinate
voice
of
the
spoiled
child
let
me
look
again
let
me
see
some
more
beautiful
things
i
have
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
even
in
my
sleep
it
was
the
plaintive
cry
of
the
child
whose
happiest
hours
are
those
spent
in
unconsciousness
look
again
then
said
the
duke
and
ask
the
heavenly
powers
what
more
they
have
to
show
you
the
boy
gazed
in
silence
then
he
broke
out
ah
now
we
are
in
the
palace
i
see
your
highness
cabinet
no
it
is
the
bedchamber
it
is
night
and
i
see
your
highness
lying
asleep
very
still
very
still
your
highness
wears
the
scapular
received
last
easter
from
his
holiness
it
is
very
dark
oh
now
a
light
begins
to
shine
where
does
it
come
from
through
the
door
no
there
is
no
door
on
that
side
of
the
room
it
shines
through
the
wall
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
ah
i
see
his
voice
mounted
to
a
cry
the
old
picture
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
the
picture
with
the
wicked
people
burning
in
it
has
opened
like
a
door
the
light
is
shining
through
it
and
now
a
lady
steps
out
from
the
wall
behind
the
picture
oh
so
beautiful
she
has
yellow
hair
as
yellow
as
my
mother
but
longer
oh
much
longer
she
carries
a
rose
in
her
hand
and
there
are
white
doves
flying
about
her
shoulders
she
is
naked
quite
naked
poor
lady
but
she
does
not
seem
to
mind
she
seems
to
be
laughing
about
it
and
your
highness
the
duke
started
up
violently
enough
enough
he
stammered
the
fever
is
on
the
child
this
agitation
is
most
pernicious
cover
the
crystal
i
say
he
sank
back
his
forehead
damp
with
perspiration
in
an
instant
the
crystal
had
been
removed
and
prince
ferrante
carried
back
to
his
mother
side
the
boy
seemed
in
nowise
affected
by
his
commotion
his
eyes
burned
with
excitement
and
he
sat
up
eagerly
as
though
not
to
miss
a
detail
of
what
was
going
forward
maria
clementina
leaned
over
and
clasped
his
hand
but
he
hardly
noticed
her
i
want
to
see
some
more
beautiful
things
he
insisted
the
duke
sat
speechless
a
fallen
heap
in
his
chair
and
the
courtiers
looked
at
each
other
their
faces
shifting
spectrally
in
the
faint
light
like
phantom
travellers
waiting
to
be
ferried
across
some
mysterious
river
at
length
heiligenstern
advanced
and
with
every
mark
of
deference
addressed
himself
to
the
duke
your
highness
said
he
quietly
need
be
under
no
apprehension
as
to
the
effect
produced
upon
the
prince
the
magic
crystal
as
your
highness
is
aware
is
under
the
protection
of
the
blessed
spirits
and
its
revelations
can
not
harm
those
who
are
enough
to
receive
them
but
the
chief
purpose
of
this
assemblage
was
to
witness
the
communication
of
vital
force
to
the
prince
by
means
of
the
electrical
current
the
crystal
by
revealing
its
secrets
to
the
prince
has
testified
to
his
perfect
purity
of
mind
and
thus
declared
him
to
be
in
a
peculiarly
fit
state
to
receive
what
may
be
designated
as
the
sacrament
of
the
new
faith
a
murmur
ran
through
the
room
but
heiligenstern
continued
without
wavering
i
mean
thereby
to
describe
that
natural
religion
which
by
instructing
its
adepts
in
the
use
of
the
hidden
potencies
of
earth
and
air
testifies
afresh
to
the
power
of
the
unseen
maker
of
the
universe
the
murmur
subsided
and
the
duke
regaining
his
voice
said
with
an
assumption
of
authority
let
the
treatment
begin
heiligenstern
immediately
spoke
a
word
to
the
oriental
who
bent
over
the
metal
bed
which
had
been
set
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room
as
he
did
so
the
air
again
darkened
and
the
figures
of
the
magician
and
his
assistants
were
discernible
only
as
flitting
shades
in
the
obscurity
suddenly
a
soft
pure
light
overflowed
the
room
the
perfume
of
flowers
filled
the
air
and
music
seemed
to
steal
out
of
the
very
walls
heiligenstern
whispered
to
the
governor
and
between
them
they
lifted
the
little
prince
from
his
chair
and
laid
him
gently
on
the
bed
the
magician
then
leaned
over
the
boy
with
a
slow
weaving
motion
of
the
hands
if
your
highness
will
be
pleased
to
sleep
he
said
i
promise
your
highness
the
most
beautiful
dreams
the
boy
smiled
back
at
him
and
he
continued
to
bend
above
the
bed
with
flitting
hands
suddenly
the
little
prince
began
to
laugh
what
does
your
highness
feel
the
magician
asked
a
prickling
such
a
soft
warm
prickling
as
if
my
blood
were
sunshine
with
motes
dancing
in
it
or
as
if
that
sparkling
wine
of
france
were
running
all
over
my
body
it
is
an
agreeable
sensation
your
highness
the
boy
nodded
it
is
well
with
your
highness
very
well
heiligenstern
began
a
loud
rhythmic
chant
and
gradually
the
air
darkened
but
with
the
mild
dimness
of
a
summer
twilight
through
which
sparks
could
be
seen
flickering
like
about
the
reclining
prince
the
hush
grew
deeper
but
in
the
stillness
odo
became
aware
of
some
unseen
influence
that
seemed
to
envelope
him
in
waves
of
exquisite
sensation
it
was
as
though
the
vast
silence
of
the
night
had
poured
into
the
room
and
like
a
dark
tepid
sea
was
lapping
about
his
body
and
rising
to
his
lips
his
thoughts
dissolved
into
emotion
seemed
to
waver
and
float
on
the
stillness
like
on
the
lift
of
the
tide
he
stood
lulled
yielding
himself
to
a
blissful
dissolution
suddenly
he
became
aware
that
the
hush
was
too
intense
too
complete
and
a
moment
later
as
though
stretched
to
the
it
burst
terrifically
into
sound
a
huge
uproar
shook
the
room
crashing
through
it
like
a
tangible
mass
the
sparks
whirled
in
a
menacing
dance
round
the
little
prince
body
and
abruptly
blotted
left
a
deeper
darkness
in
which
the
confused
herding
movements
of
startled
figures
were
indistinguishably
merged
a
flash
of
silence
followed
then
the
liberated
forces
of
the
night
broke
in
rain
and
thunder
on
the
rocking
walls
of
the
room
light
light
some
one
stammered
and
at
the
same
moment
a
door
was
flung
open
admitting
a
burst
of
and
a
group
of
figures
in
ecclesiastical
dress
against
which
the
white
gown
and
black
hood
of
father
ignazio
detached
themselves
the
dominican
stepped
toward
the
duke
your
highness
said
he
in
a
tone
of
quiet
resolution
must
pardon
this
interruption
i
act
at
the
bidding
of
the
holy
office
even
in
that
moment
of
profound
disarray
the
name
sent
a
deeper
shudder
through
his
hearers
the
duke
who
stood
grasping
the
arms
of
his
chair
raised
his
head
and
tried
to
stare
down
the
intruders
but
no
one
heeded
his
look
at
a
signal
from
the
dominican
a
servant
had
brought
in
a
pair
of
candelabra
and
in
their
commonplace
light
the
cabalistic
hangings
the
magician
appliances
and
his
attendants
looked
as
tawdry
as
the
paraphernalia
of
a
village
quack
heiligenstern
alone
survived
the
test
erect
at
bay
as
it
were
his
black
robe
falling
in
hieratic
folds
the
white
wand
raised
in
his
hands
he
might
have
personified
the
prince
of
darkness
drawn
up
undaunted
against
the
hosts
of
the
lord
some
one
had
snatched
the
little
prince
from
his
stretcher
and
maria
clementina
holding
him
to
her
breast
sat
palely
confronting
the
sorcerer
she
alone
seemed
to
measure
her
strength
against
his
in
some
mysterious
conflict
of
the
will
but
meanwhile
the
duke
had
regained
his
voice
my
father
said
he
on
what
information
does
the
holy
office
act
the
dominican
drew
a
parchment
from
his
breast
on
that
of
the
inquisitor
general
your
highness
he
replied
handing
the
paper
to
the
duke
who
unfolded
it
with
trembling
hands
but
was
plainly
unable
to
master
its
contents
father
ignazio
beckoned
to
an
ecclesiastic
who
had
entered
the
room
in
his
train
this
your
highness
said
he
is
the
abate
de
crucis
of
innsbruck
who
was
lately
commissioned
by
the
holy
office
to
enquire
into
the
practises
and
doctrine
of
the
order
of
the
illuminati
that
corrupt
and
atheistical
sect
which
has
been
the
cause
of
so
much
scandal
among
the
german
principalities
in
the
course
of
his
investigations
he
became
aware
that
the
order
had
secretly
established
a
lodge
in
pianura
and
hastening
hither
from
rome
to
advise
your
highness
of
the
fact
has
discovered
in
the
count
heiligenstern
one
of
the
most
notorious
apostles
of
the
order
he
turned
to
the
priest
signor
abate
he
said
you
confirm
these
facts
the
abate
de
crucis
quietly
advanced
he
was
a
slight
pale
man
of
about
thirty
with
a
thoughtful
and
indulgent
cast
of
countenance
in
every
particular
said
he
bowing
profoundly
to
the
duke
and
speaking
in
a
low
voice
of
singular
sweetness
it
has
been
my
duty
to
track
this
man
career
from
its
ignoble
beginning
to
its
infamous
culmination
and
i
have
been
able
to
place
in
the
hands
of
the
holy
office
the
most
complete
proofs
of
his
guilt
the
count
heiligenstern
is
the
son
of
a
tailor
in
a
small
village
of
pomerania
after
passing
through
various
vicissitudes
with
which
i
need
not
trouble
your
highness
he
obtained
the
confidence
of
the
notorious
weishaupt
the
founder
of
the
german
order
of
the
illuminati
and
together
this
precious
couple
have
indefatigably
propagated
their
obscene
and
blasphemous
doctrines
that
they
preach
atheism
and
tyrannicide
i
need
not
tell
your
highness
but
it
is
less
generally
known
that
they
have
made
these
infamous
doctrines
the
cloak
of
private
vices
from
which
even
paganism
would
have
recoiled
the
man
now
before
me
among
other
open
offences
against
society
is
known
to
have
seduced
a
young
girl
of
noble
family
in
ratisbon
and
to
have
murdered
her
child
his
own
wife
and
children
he
long
since
abandoned
and
disowned
and
the
youth
yonder
whom
he
describes
as
a
georgian
slave
rescued
from
the
grand
signior
galleys
is
in
fact
the
wife
of
a
greek
juggler
of
ravenna
and
has
forsaken
her
husband
to
live
in
criminal
intercourse
with
an
atheist
and
assassin
this
indictment
pronounced
with
an
absence
of
emotion
which
made
each
word
cut
the
air
like
the
separate
stroke
of
a
lash
was
followed
by
a
prolonged
silence
then
one
of
the
duchess
ladies
cried
out
suddenly
and
burst
into
tears
this
was
the
signal
for
a
general
outbreak
the
room
was
filled
with
a
confusion
of
voices
and
among
the
groups
surging
about
him
odo
noticed
a
number
of
the
duke
sbirri
making
their
way
quietly
through
the
crowd
the
notary
of
the
holy
office
advanced
toward
heiligenstern
who
had
placed
himself
against
the
wall
with
one
arm
flung
about
his
trembling
acolyte
the
duchess
her
boy
still
clasped
against
her
remained
proudly
seated
but
her
eyes
met
odo
in
a
glance
of
terrified
entreaty
and
at
the
same
instant
he
felt
a
clutch
on
his
sleeve
and
heard
cantapresto
whisper
cavaliere
a
boat
waits
at
the
landing
below
the
tanners
lane
the
shortest
way
to
it
is
through
the
gardens
and
your
excellency
will
find
the
gate
beyond
the
chinese
pavilion
unlocked
he
had
vanished
before
odo
could
look
round
the
latter
still
wavered
but
as
he
did
so
he
caught
trescorre
face
through
the
crowd
the
minister
eye
was
fixed
on
him
and
the
discovery
was
enough
to
make
him
plunge
through
the
narrow
wake
left
by
cantapresto
retreat
odo
made
his
way
unhindered
to
the
which
was
also
thronged
ecclesiastics
servants
and
even
beggars
from
the
courtyard
jostling
each
other
in
their
struggle
to
see
what
was
going
forward
the
confusion
favoured
his
escape
and
a
moment
later
he
was
hastening
down
the
tapestry
gallery
and
through
the
vacant
corridors
of
the
palace
he
was
familiar
with
across
this
network
of
passages
but
in
his
bewilderment
he
pressed
on
down
the
great
stairs
and
across
the
echoing
that
opened
on
the
terrace
a
drowsy
sentinel
challenged
him
and
on
odo
explaining
that
he
sought
to
leave
and
not
to
enter
the
palace
replied
that
he
had
his
orders
to
let
no
one
out
that
night
for
a
moment
odo
was
at
a
loss
then
he
remembered
his
passport
it
seemed
to
him
an
interminable
time
before
the
sentinel
had
scrutinised
it
by
the
light
of
a
guttering
candle
and
to
his
surprise
he
found
himself
in
a
cold
sweat
of
fear
the
rattle
of
the
storm
simulated
footsteps
at
his
heels
and
he
felt
the
blind
rage
of
a
man
within
shot
of
invisible
foes
the
passport
restored
he
plunged
out
into
the
night
it
was
in
the
gardens
and
the
rain
drove
down
with
the
guttural
rush
of
a
midsummer
storm
so
fierce
was
its
fall
that
it
seemed
to
suck
up
the
earth
in
its
black
eddies
and
he
felt
himself
swept
along
over
a
heaving
hissing
surface
with
wet
boughs
lashing
out
at
him
as
he
fled
from
one
terrace
to
another
he
dropped
to
lower
depths
of
buffeting
dripping
darkness
till
he
found
his
hand
on
the
and
swung
to
the
black
lane
below
the
wall
thence
on
a
run
he
wound
to
the
quarter
by
the
river
a
district
commonly
as
as
it
was
but
tonight
of
both
evils
by
the
vehement
sweep
of
the
storm
here
he
groped
his
way
among
slippery
places
and
past
huddled
to
the
piles
of
the
wharf
the
rain
was
now
subdued
to
a
noiseless
vertical
descent
through
which
he
could
hear
the
tap
of
the
river
against
the
piles
scarce
knowing
what
he
fled
or
whither
he
was
flying
he
let
himself
down
the
steps
and
found
the
flat
of
a
boat
bottom
underfoot
a
boatman
distinguishable
only
as
a
black
bulk
in
the
stern
steadied
his
descent
with
outstretched
hand
then
the
bow
swung
round
and
after
a
labouring
stroke
or
two
they
caught
the
current
and
were
swept
down
through
the
rushing
darkness
book
iii
the
choice
the
vision
touched
him
on
the
lips
and
said
hereafter
thou
shalt
eat
me
in
thy
bread
drink
me
in
all
thy
kisses
feel
my
hand
steal
thy
palm
and
joy
and
see
me
stand
watchful
at
every
crossing
of
the
ways
the
insatiate
lover
of
thy
nights
and
days
it
was
at
naples
some
two
years
later
that
the
circumstances
of
his
flight
were
recalled
to
odo
valsecca
by
the
sound
of
a
voice
which
at
once
mysteriously
connected
itself
with
the
incidents
of
that
wild
night
he
was
seated
with
a
party
of
gentlemen
in
the
saloon
of
sir
william
hamilton
famous
villa
of
posilipo
where
they
were
sipping
the
ambassador
iced
sherbet
and
examining
certain
engraved
gems
and
recently
taken
from
the
excavations
the
scene
was
such
as
always
appealed
to
odo
fancy
the
spacious
room
luxuriously
fitted
with
carpets
and
curtains
in
the
english
style
and
opening
on
a
prospect
of
classical
beauty
and
antique
renown
in
his
hands
the
rarest
specimens
of
that
buried
art
which
like
some
belated
golden
harvest
was
now
everywhere
thrusting
itself
through
the
neapolitan
soil
and
about
him
men
of
taste
and
understanding
discussing
the
historic
or
mythological
meaning
of
the
objects
before
them
and
quoting
homer
or
horace
in
corroboration
of
their
guesses
several
visitors
had
joined
the
party
since
odo
entrance
and
it
was
from
a
group
of
these
later
arrivals
that
the
voice
had
reached
him
he
looked
round
and
saw
a
man
of
refined
and
scholarly
appearance
dressed
en
abbe
as
was
the
general
habit
in
rome
and
naples
and
holding
in
one
hand
the
celebrated
blue
vase
cut
in
cameo
which
sir
william
had
recently
purchased
from
the
barberini
family
these
reliefs
the
stranger
was
saying
whether
cut
in
the
substance
itself
or
afterward
affixed
to
the
glass
certainly
belong
to
the
grecian
period
of
and
recall
by
the
purity
of
their
design
the
finest
carvings
of
dioskorides
his
italian
was
tinged
by
a
slight
foreign
accent
which
seemed
to
connect
him
still
more
definitely
with
the
episode
his
voice
recalled
odo
turned
to
a
gentleman
at
his
side
and
asked
the
speaker
name
that
was
the
reply
is
the
abate
de
crucis
a
scholar
and
cognoscente
as
you
perceive
and
at
present
attached
to
the
household
of
the
papal
nuncio
instantly
odo
beheld
the
tumultuous
scene
in
the
duke
apartments
and
heard
the
indictment
of
heiligenstern
falling
in
tranquil
accents
from
the
very
lips
which
were
now
in
the
same
tone
discussing
the
date
of
a
greek
cameo
vase
even
in
that
moment
of
disorder
he
had
been
struck
by
the
voice
and
aspect
of
the
agent
of
the
holy
office
and
by
a
singular
distinction
that
seemed
to
set
the
man
himself
above
the
coil
of
passions
in
which
his
action
was
involved
to
odo
spontaneous
yet
reflective
temper
there
was
something
peculiarly
impressive
in
the
kind
of
detachment
which
implies
not
obtuseness
or
indifference
but
a
higher
sensitiveness
disciplined
by
choice
now
he
felt
a
renewed
pang
of
regret
that
such
qualities
should
be
found
in
the
service
of
the
opposition
but
the
feeling
was
not
incompatible
with
a
wish
to
be
more
nearly
acquainted
with
their
possessor
the
two
years
elapsing
since
odo
departure
from
pianura
had
widened
if
they
had
not
lifted
his
outlook
if
he
had
lost
something
of
his
early
enthusiasm
he
had
exchanged
it
for
a
larger
experience
of
cities
and
men
and
for
the
born
of
varied
intercourse
he
had
reached
a
point
where
he
was
able
to
survey
his
past
dispassionately
and
to
disentangle
the
threads
of
the
intrigue
in
which
he
had
so
nearly
lost
his
footing
the
actual
circumstances
of
his
escape
were
still
wrapped
in
mystery
he
could
only
conjecture
that
the
duchess
foreseeing
the
course
events
would
take
had
planned
with
cantapresto
to
save
him
in
spite
of
himself
his
nocturnal
flight
down
the
river
had
carried
him
to
ponte
di
po
the
point
where
the
piana
flows
into
the
po
the
latter
river
forming
for
a
few
miles
the
southern
frontier
of
the
duchy
here
his
passport
had
taken
him
safely
past
the
and
following
the
indications
of
the
boatman
he
had
found
outside
the
miserable
village
clustered
about
the
customs
a
which
brought
him
before
the
next
to
monte
alloro
of
the
real
danger
from
which
this
timely
retreat
had
removed
him
gamba
subsequent
letters
had
brought
ample
proof
it
was
indeed
mainly
against
himself
that
both
parties
perhaps
jointly
had
directed
their
attack
designing
to
take
him
in
the
toils
ostensibly
prepared
for
the
illuminati
his
evasion
known
the
holy
office
had
contented
itself
with
imprisoning
heiligenstern
in
one
of
the
papal
fortresses
near
the
adriatic
while
his
mistress
though
bred
in
the
greek
confession
was
confined
in
a
convent
of
the
sepolte
vive
and
his
oriental
servant
sent
to
the
duke
galleys
as
to
those
suspected
of
affiliations
with
the
forbidden
sect
fines
and
penances
were
imposed
on
a
few
of
the
least
conspicuous
while
the
chief
offenders
either
from
motives
of
policy
or
thanks
to
their
superior
adroitness
were
suffered
to
escape
without
a
reprimand
after
this
gamba
letters
reported
the
duchy
had
lapsed
into
its
former
state
of
quiescence
prince
ferrante
had
been
seriously
ailing
since
the
night
of
the
electrical
treatment
but
the
pope
having
sent
his
private
physician
to
pianura
the
boy
had
rallied
under
the
latter
care
the
duke
as
was
natural
had
suffered
an
acute
relapse
of
piety
spending
his
time
in
expiatory
pilgrimages
to
the
various
votive
churches
of
the
duchy
and
declining
to
transact
any
public
business
till
he
should
have
compiled
with
his
own
hand
a
calendar
of
the
lives
of
the
saints
with
the
initial
letters
painted
in
miniature
which
he
designed
to
present
to
his
holiness
at
easter
meanwhile
odo
at
monte
alloro
found
himself
in
surroundings
so
different
from
those
he
had
left
that
it
seemed
incredible
they
should
exist
in
the
same
world
the
duke
of
monte
alloro
was
that
rare
survival
of
a
stronger
age
a
cynic
in
a
period
of
sentimental
optimism
of
fervid
enthusiasms
and
tearful
philanthropy
he
represented
the
prince
of
the
renaissance
crushing
his
people
with
taxes
but
dazzling
them
with
festivities
infuriating
them
by
his
disregard
of
the
public
welfare
but
fascinating
them
by
his
good
looks
his
tolerance
of
old
abuses
his
ridicule
of
the
monks
and
by
the
careless
libertinage
which
had
founded
the
fortunes
of
more
than
one
husband
and
father
for
the
duke
always
paid
well
for
what
he
appropriated
he
had
grown
old
in
his
pleasant
sins
and
these
as
such
raiment
will
had
grown
old
and
dingy
with
him
but
if
no
longer
splendid
he
was
still
and
drew
to
his
court
the
most
brilliant
adventurers
of
italy
spite
of
his
preference
for
such
company
he
had
a
nobler
side
the
ruins
of
a
fine
but
uncultivated
intelligence
and
a
taste
for
all
that
was
young
generous
and
high
in
looks
and
courage
he
was
at
once
drawn
to
odo
who
instinctively
addressed
himself
to
these
qualities
and
whose
conversation
and
manners
threw
into
relief
the
vulgarity
of
the
old
duke
cronies
the
latter
was
the
shrewd
enough
to
enjoy
the
contrast
at
the
expense
of
his
sycophants
vanity
and
the
cavaliere
valsecca
was
for
a
while
the
reigning
favourite
it
would
have
been
hard
to
say
whether
his
patron
was
most
tickled
by
his
zeal
for
economic
reforms
or
by
his
faith
in
the
perfectibility
of
man
both
these
articles
of
odo
creed
drew
tears
of
enjoyment
from
the
old
duke
puffy
eyes
and
he
was
never
tired
of
declaring
that
only
his
hatred
for
his
nephew
of
pianura
induced
him
to
accord
his
protection
to
so
dangerous
an
enemy
of
society
odo
at
first
fancied
that
it
was
in
response
to
a
mere
whim
of
the
duke
that
he
had
been
despatched
to
monte
alloro
but
he
soon
perceived
that
the
invitation
had
been
inspired
by
maria
wish
some
three
months
after
odo
arrival
cantapresto
suddenly
appeared
with
a
packet
of
letters
from
the
duchess
among
them
her
highness
had
included
a
few
lines
to
odo
whom
she
briefly
adjured
not
to
return
to
pianura
but
to
comply
in
all
things
with
her
desires
soon
after
this
the
old
duke
sent
for
odo
and
asked
him
how
his
present
mode
of
life
agreed
with
his
tastes
odo
who
had
learned
that
frankness
was
the
surest
way
to
the
duke
favour
replied
that
while
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
than
the
circumstances
of
his
sojourn
at
monte
alloro
he
must
own
to
a
wish
to
travel
when
the
occasion
offered
why
this
is
as
i
fancied
replied
the
duke
who
held
in
his
hand
an
open
letter
on
which
odo
recognised
maria
clementina
seal
we
have
always
he
continued
spoken
plainly
with
each
other
and
i
will
not
conceal
from
you
that
it
is
for
your
best
interests
that
you
should
remain
away
from
pianura
for
the
present
the
duke
as
you
doubtless
divine
is
anxious
for
your
return
and
her
highness
for
that
very
reason
is
urgent
that
you
should
prolong
your
absence
it
is
notorious
that
the
duke
soon
wearies
of
those
about
him
and
that
your
best
chance
of
regaining
his
favour
is
to
keep
out
of
his
reach
and
let
your
enemies
hang
themselves
in
the
noose
they
have
prepared
for
you
for
my
part
i
am
always
glad
to
do
an
to
that
snivelling
friar
my
nephew
and
the
more
so
when
i
can
seriously
oblige
a
friend
and
as
you
have
perhaps
guessed
the
duke
dares
not
ask
for
your
return
while
i
show
a
fancy
for
your
company
but
this
added
he
with
an
ironical
twinkle
is
a
tame
place
for
a
young
man
of
your
missionary
temper
and
i
have
a
mind
to
send
you
on
a
visit
to
that
ferdinand
of
naples
in
whose
dominions
a
man
may
yet
burn
for
heresy
or
be
drawn
and
quartered
for
poaching
on
a
nobleman
preserves
i
am
advised
that
some
rare
treasures
have
lately
been
taken
from
the
excavations
there
and
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
oblige
me
by
acquiring
a
few
for
my
gallery
i
will
give
you
letters
to
a
cognoscente
of
my
acquaintance
who
will
put
his
experience
at
the
disposal
of
your
excellent
taste
and
the
funds
at
your
service
will
i
hope
enable
you
to
outbid
the
english
brigands
who
as
the
romans
say
would
carry
off
the
colosseum
if
it
were
portable
in
all
this
odo
discerned
maria
clementina
hand
and
an
instinctive
resistance
made
him
hang
back
upon
his
patron
proposal
but
the
only
alternative
was
to
return
to
pianura
and
every
letter
from
gamba
urged
on
him
for
the
very
reasons
the
duke
had
given
the
duty
of
keeping
out
of
reach
as
the
surest
means
of
saving
himself
and
the
cause
to
which
he
was
pledged
nothing
remained
but
a
graceful
acquiescence
and
early
the
next
spring
he
started
for
naples
his
first
impulse
had
been
to
send
cantapresto
back
to
the
duchess
he
knew
that
he
owed
his
escape
me
grave
difficulties
to
the
prompt
action
on
the
night
of
heiligenstern
arrest
but
he
was
equally
sure
that
such
action
might
not
always
be
as
favourable
to
his
plans
it
was
plain
that
cantapresto
was
paid
to
spy
on
him
and
that
whenever
odo
intentions
clashed
with
those
of
his
protectors
the
soprano
would
side
with
the
latter
but
there
was
something
in
the
air
of
monte
alloro
which
dispelled
such
considerations
or
at
least
weakened
the
impulse
to
act
on
them
cantapresto
as
usual
had
attracted
notice
at
court
his
glibness
and
versatility
amused
the
duke
and
to
odo
he
was
as
difficult
to
put
off
as
a
bad
habit
he
had
become
so
accomplished
a
servant
that
he
seemed
a
sixth
sense
of
his
master
and
when
the
latter
prepared
to
start
on
his
travels
cantapresto
took
his
usual
seat
in
the
chaise
to
a
traveller
of
odo
temper
there
could
be
few
more
agreeable
journeys
than
the
one
on
which
he
was
setting
out
and
the
duke
being
in
no
haste
to
have
his
commission
executed
his
messenger
had
full
leisure
to
enjoy
every
stage
of
the
way
he
profited
by
this
to
visit
several
of
the
small
principalities
north
of
the
apennines
before
turning
toward
genoa
whence
he
was
to
take
ship
for
the
south
when
he
left
monte
alloro
the
land
had
worn
the
bleached
face
of
february
and
it
was
amazing
to
his
eyes
to
find
himself
on
the
in
the
full
exuberance
of
summer
seated
by
this
halcyon
shore
genoa
in
its
carved
and
frescoed
splendour
just
then
celebrating
with
the
customary
gorgeous
ritual
the
accession
of
a
new
doge
seemed
to
odo
like
the
frame
of
some
renaissance
triumph
but
the
splendid
houses
with
their
marble
peristyles
and
the
painted
villas
in
their
along
the
shore
housed
a
dull
and
society
content
to
amass
wealth
and
play
biribi
under
the
eyes
of
their
ancestral
vandykes
without
any
concern
as
to
the
questions
agitating
the
world
a
kind
of
fat
commercial
dulness
a
lack
of
that
personal
distinction
which
justifies
magnificence
seemed
to
odo
the
prevailing
note
of
the
place
nor
was
he
sorry
when
his
packet
set
sail
for
naples
here
indeed
he
found
all
the
vivacity
that
genoa
lacked
few
cities
could
at
first
acquaintance
be
more
engaging
to
the
stranger
dull
and
brown
as
it
appeared
after
the
rich
tints
of
genoa
yet
so
gloriously
did
sea
and
land
embrace
it
so
lavishly
the
sun
gild
and
the
moon
silver
it
that
it
seemed
steeped
in
the
surrounding
hues
of
nature
and
what
a
nature
to
eyes
subdued
to
the
sober
tints
of
the
north
its
spectacular
quality
that
studied
sequence
of
effects
ranging
from
the
translucent
outline
of
capri
and
the
fantastically
blue
mountains
of
the
coast
to
vesuvius
lifting
its
torch
above
the
plain
this
prodigal
response
to
fancy
claims
suggested
the
boundless
invention
of
some
great
scenic
artist
some
olympian
veronese
with
sea
and
sky
for
a
palette
and
then
the
city
itself
huddled
between
bay
and
mountains
and
seething
and
bubbling
like
a
titan
cauldron
here
was
life
at
its
source
not
checked
directed
utilised
but
gushing
forth
uncontrollably
through
every
fissure
of
the
brown
walls
and
reeking
streets
love
and
hatred
mirth
and
folly
impudence
and
greed
going
naked
and
unashamed
as
the
lazzaroni
on
the
quays
the
variegated
surface
of
it
all
was
fascinating
to
odo
it
set
free
his
powers
of
purely
physical
enjoyment
keeping
all
deeper
sensations
in
abeyance
these
however
presently
found
satisfaction
in
that
other
hidden
beauty
of
which
city
and
plain
were
but
the
sumptuous
drapery
it
is
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
to
the
trained
eyes
of
the
day
the
visible
naples
hardly
existed
so
absorbed
were
they
in
the
perusal
of
her
buried
past
the
fever
of
excavation
was
on
every
one
no
social
or
political
problem
could
find
a
hearing
while
the
subject
of
the
last
coin
or
from
pompeii
or
herculanaeum
remained
undecided
odo
at
first
an
amused
spectator
gradually
found
himself
engrossed
in
the
fierce
quarrels
raging
over
the
date
of
an
intaglio
or
the
myth
represented
on
an
amphora
the
intrinsic
beauty
of
the
objects
and
the
light
they
shed
on
one
of
the
most
brilliant
phases
of
human
history
were
in
fact
sufficient
to
justify
the
prevailing
ardour
and
the
reconstructive
habit
he
had
acquired
from
crescenti
lent
a
living
interest
to
the
driest
discussion
between
rival
collectors
gradually
other
influences
reasserted
themselves
at
the
house
of
sir
william
hamilton
then
the
centre
of
the
most
polished
society
in
naples
he
met
not
only
artists
and
archeologists
but
men
of
letters
and
of
affairs
among
these
he
was
peculiarly
drawn
to
the
two
distinguished
economists
the
abate
galiani
and
the
cavaliere
filangieri
in
whose
company
he
enjoyed
for
the
first
time
sound
learning
unhampered
by
pedantry
the
lively
galiani
proved
that
social
tastes
and
a
broad
wit
are
not
incompatible
with
more
serious
interests
and
filangieri
threw
the
charm
of
a
graceful
personality
over
any
topic
he
discussed
in
the
latter
indeed
courtly
young
and
romantic
a
thinker
whose
intellectual
acuteness
was
steeped
in
moral
emotion
odo
beheld
the
type
of
the
new
chivalry
an
ideal
leader
of
the
campaign
against
social
injustice
filangieri
represented
the
extremest
optimism
of
the
day
his
sense
of
existing
abuses
was
only
equalled
by
his
faith
in
their
speedy
amendment
love
was
to
cure
all
evils
the
love
of
man
for
man
the
effusive
sympathy
of
the
school
of
the
vicaire
savoyard
was
to
purge
the
emotions
by
tenderness
and
pity
in
gamba
the
victim
of
the
conditions
he
denounced
the
sense
of
present
hardship
prevailed
over
the
faith
in
future
improvement
while
filangieri
social
superiority
mitigated
his
view
of
the
evils
and
magnified
the
efficacy
of
the
proposed
remedies
odo
days
passed
agreeably
in
such
intercourse
or
in
the
excitement
of
excursions
to
the
ruined
cities
and
as
the
court
and
the
higher
society
of
naples
offered
little
to
engage
him
he
gradually
restricted
himself
to
the
small
circle
of
chosen
spirits
gathered
at
the
villa
hamilton
to
these
he
fancied
the
abate
de
crucis
might
prove
an
interesting
addition
and
the
desire
to
learn
something
of
this
problematic
person
induced
him
to
quit
the
villa
at
the
moment
when
the
abate
took
leave
they
found
themselves
together
on
the
threshold
and
odo
recalling
to
the
other
the
circumstances
of
their
first
meeting
proposed
that
they
should
dismiss
their
carriages
and
regain
the
city
on
foot
de
crucis
readily
consented
and
they
were
soon
descending
the
hill
of
posilipo
here
and
there
a
turn
in
the
road
brought
them
to
an
open
space
whence
they
commanded
the
bay
from
procida
to
sorrento
with
capri
afloat
in
liquid
gold
and
the
long
blue
shadow
of
vesuvius
stretching
like
a
menace
toward
the
city
the
spectacle
was
one
of
which
odo
never
wearied
but
today
it
barely
diverted
him
from
the
charms
of
his
companion
talk
the
abate
de
crucis
had
that
quality
of
repressed
enthusiasm
of
an
intellectual
sensibility
tempered
by
which
exercises
the
strongest
attraction
over
a
mind
not
yet
master
of
itself
though
all
he
said
had
a
personal
note
he
seemed
to
withhold
himself
even
in
the
moment
of
greatest
expansion
like
some
prince
who
should
enrich
his
favourites
from
the
public
treasury
but
keep
his
private
fortune
unimpaired
in
the
course
of
their
conversation
odo
learned
that
though
of
austrian
birth
his
companion
was
of
mingled
english
and
florentine
parentage
a
fact
perhaps
explaining
the
mixture
of
urbanity
and
reserve
that
lent
such
charm
to
his
manner
he
told
odo
that
his
connection
with
the
holy
office
had
been
only
temporary
and
that
having
contracted
a
severe
cold
the
previous
winter
in
germany
he
had
accepted
a
secretaryship
in
the
service
of
the
papal
nuncio
in
order
to
enjoy
the
benefits
of
a
mild
climate
by
profession
he
added
i
am
a
pedagogue
and
shall
soon
travel
to
rome
where
i
have
been
called
by
prince
bracciano
to
act
as
governor
to
his
son
and
meanwhile
i
am
taking
advantage
of
my
residence
here
to
indulge
my
taste
for
antiquarian
studies
he
went
on
to
praise
the
company
they
had
just
left
declaring
that
he
knew
no
better
way
for
a
young
man
to
form
his
mind
than
by
frequenting
the
society
of
men
of
conflicting
views
and
equal
capacity
nothing
said
he
is
more
injurious
to
the
growth
of
character
than
to
be
secluded
from
argument
and
opposition
as
nothing
is
healthier
than
to
be
obliged
to
find
good
reasons
for
one
beliefs
on
pain
of
surrendering
them
but
said
odo
struck
with
this
declaration
to
a
man
of
your
cloth
there
is
one
belief
which
never
surrenders
to
reason
the
other
smiled
true
he
agreed
but
i
often
marvel
to
see
how
little
our
opponents
know
of
that
belief
the
wisest
of
them
seem
in
the
case
of
those
children
at
our
country
fairs
who
gape
at
the
incredible
things
depicted
on
the
curtains
of
the
booths
without
asking
themselves
whether
the
reality
matches
its
presentment
the
weakness
of
human
nature
has
compelled
us
to
paint
the
outer
curtain
of
the
sanctuary
in
gaudy
colours
and
the
malicious
fancy
of
our
enemies
has
given
a
monstrous
outline
to
these
pictures
but
what
are
such
vanities
to
one
who
has
passed
beyond
and
beheld
the
beauty
of
the
king
daughter
all
glorious
within
as
though
unwilling
to
linger
on
such
grave
topics
he
turned
the
talk
to
the
scene
at
their
feet
questioning
odo
as
to
the
impression
naples
had
made
on
him
he
listened
courteously
to
the
young
man
comments
on
the
wretched
state
of
the
peasantry
the
extravagances
of
the
court
and
nobility
and
the
judicial
corruption
which
made
the
lower
classes
submit
to
any
injustice
rather
than
seek
redress
through
the
courts
de
crucis
agreed
with
him
in
the
main
admitting
that
the
monopoly
of
corn
the
maintenance
of
feudal
rights
and
the
king
indifference
to
the
graver
duties
of
his
rank
placed
the
kingdom
of
naples
far
below
such
states
as
tuscany
or
venetia
though
he
added
i
think
our
economists
in
praising
one
state
at
the
expense
of
another
too
often
overlook
those
differences
of
character
and
climate
that
must
ever
make
it
impossible
to
govern
different
races
in
the
same
manner
our
peasants
have
a
blunt
saying
cut
off
the
dog
tail
and
he
is
still
a
dog
and
so
i
suspect
the
most
enlightened
rule
would
hardly
bring
this
prompt
and
choleric
people
living
on
a
volcanic
soil
amid
a
teeming
vegetation
into
any
resemblance
with
the
tuscan
or
the
gentle
and
dignified
roman
as
he
spoke
they
emerged
upon
the
chiaia
where
at
that
hour
the
quality
took
the
air
in
their
carriages
while
the
lower
classes
thronged
the
footway
a
more
vivacious
scene
no
city
of
europe
could
present
the
gilt
coaches
drawn
by
six
or
eight
of
the
lively
neapolitan
horses
decked
with
plumes
and
artificial
flowers
and
preceded
by
running
footmen
who
beat
the
aside
with
long
staves
the
ladies
seated
in
this
file
of
carriages
bejewelled
like
miraculous
images
and
languidly
bowing
to
their
friends
the
throngs
of
citizens
and
their
wives
in
holiday
dress
the
sellers
of
sherbet
ices
and
pastry
bearing
their
trays
and
barrels
through
the
crowd
with
strange
cries
and
the
jingling
of
bells
the
friars
of
every
order
in
their
various
habits
the
the
lazzaroni
cripples
and
beggars
who
fringed
the
throng
like
the
line
of
scum
edging
a
fair
lake
this
medley
of
sound
and
colour
which
in
fact
resembled
some
sudden
growth
of
the
fiery
soil
was
an
expressive
comment
on
the
abate
words
look
he
continued
as
he
and
odo
drew
aside
to
escape
the
mud
from
an
emblazoned
chariot
at
the
on
the
panels
of
that
coach
and
the
on
the
liveries
of
those
lacqueys
is
there
any
other
city
in
the
world
where
gold
is
so
prodigally
used
where
the
monks
gild
their
relics
the
nobility
their
servants
the
apothecaries
their
pills
the
very
butchers
their
mutton
one
might
fancy
their
bright
sun
had
set
them
the
example
and
how
cold
and
grey
all
soberer
tints
must
seem
to
these
children
of
apollo
well
so
it
is
with
their
religion
and
their
daily
life
i
wager
half
those
naked
wretches
yonder
would
rather
attend
a
fine
religious
service
with
abundance
of
gilt
candles
music
from
gilt
and
incense
from
gilt
censers
than
eat
a
good
meal
or
sleep
in
a
decent
bed
as
they
would
rather
starve
under
a
handsome
merry
king
that
has
the
name
of
being
the
best
in
europe
than
go
full
under
one
of
your
solemn
reforming
austrian
archdukes
the
words
recalled
to
odo
crescenti
theory
of
the
influence
of
character
and
climate
on
the
course
of
history
and
this
subject
soon
engrossing
both
speakers
they
wandered
on
inattentive
to
their
surroundings
till
they
found
themselves
in
the
thickest
concourse
of
the
toledo
here
for
a
moment
the
dense
crowd
hemmed
them
in
and
as
they
stood
observing
the
humours
of
the
scene
odo
eye
fell
on
the
figure
of
a
man
in
doctor
dress
who
was
being
led
through
the
press
by
two
agents
of
the
inquisition
the
sight
was
too
common
to
have
fixed
his
attention
had
he
not
recognised
with
a
start
the
irascible
professor
who
on
his
first
visit
to
vivaldi
had
defended
the
diluvial
theory
of
creation
the
sight
raised
a
host
of
memories
from
which
odo
would
gladly
have
beaten
a
retreat
but
the
crowd
held
him
in
check
and
a
moment
later
he
saw
that
the
doctor
eyes
were
fixed
on
him
with
an
air
of
recognition
a
movement
of
pity
succeeded
his
first
impulse
and
turning
to
de
crucis
he
exclaimed
i
see
yonder
an
old
acquaintance
who
seems
in
an
unlucky
plight
and
with
whom
i
should
be
glad
to
speak
the
other
following
his
glance
beckoned
to
one
of
the
sbirri
who
made
his
way
through
the
throng
with
the
alacrity
of
one
summoned
by
a
superior
de
crucis
exchanged
a
few
words
with
him
and
then
signed
to
him
to
return
to
his
charge
who
presently
vanished
in
some
fresh
shifting
of
the
crowd
your
friend
said
de
crucis
has
been
summoned
before
the
holy
office
to
answer
a
charge
of
heresy
preferred
by
the
authorities
he
has
lately
been
appointed
to
the
chair
of
physical
sciences
in
the
university
here
and
has
doubtless
allowed
himself
to
publish
openly
views
that
were
better
expounded
in
the
closet
his
offence
however
appears
to
be
a
mild
one
and
i
make
no
doubt
he
will
be
set
free
in
a
few
days
this
however
did
not
satisfy
odo
and
he
asked
de
crucis
if
there
were
no
way
of
speaking
with
the
doctor
at
once
his
companion
hesitated
it
can
easily
be
arranged
said
he
but
pardon
me
cavaliere
are
you
in
mixing
yourself
in
such
matters
i
am
in
seeking
to
serve
a
friend
odo
somewhat
hotly
returned
and
de
crucis
with
a
faint
smile
of
approval
replied
quietly
in
that
case
i
will
obtain
permission
for
you
to
visit
your
friend
in
the
morning
he
was
true
to
his
word
and
the
next
forenoon
odo
accompanied
by
an
officer
of
police
was
taken
to
the
prison
of
the
inquisition
here
he
found
his
old
acquaintance
seated
in
a
clean
commodious
room
and
reading
aristotle
history
of
animals
the
only
volume
of
his
library
that
he
had
been
permitted
to
carry
with
him
he
welcomed
odo
heartily
and
on
the
latter
enquiring
what
had
brought
him
to
this
plight
replied
with
some
dignity
that
he
had
been
led
there
in
the
fulfilment
of
his
duty
some
months
ago
he
continued
i
was
summoned
hither
to
profess
the
natural
sciences
in
the
university
a
summons
i
readily
accepted
since
i
hoped
by
the
study
of
a
volcanic
soil
to
enlarge
my
knowledge
of
the
globe
formation
such
in
fact
was
the
case
but
to
my
surprise
my
researches
led
me
to
adopt
the
views
i
had
formerly
combated
and
i
now
find
myself
in
the
ranks
of
the
vulcanists
or
believers
in
the
secondary
origin
of
the
earth
a
view
you
may
remember
i
once
opposed
with
all
the
zeal
of
inexperience
having
firmly
established
every
point
in
my
argument
according
to
the
baconian
method
of
investigation
i
felt
it
my
duty
to
enlighten
my
scholars
and
in
the
course
of
my
last
lecture
i
announced
the
result
of
my
investigations
i
was
of
course
aware
of
the
inevitable
result
but
the
servants
of
truth
have
no
choice
but
to
follow
where
she
calls
and
many
have
joyfully
traversed
stonier
places
than
i
am
likely
to
travel
nothing
could
exceed
the
respect
with
which
odo
heard
this
simple
confession
of
faith
it
was
as
though
the
speaker
had
unconsciously
convicted
him
of
remissness
of
cowardice
even
so
vain
and
windy
his
theorising
seemed
judged
by
the
other
deliberate
act
yet
placed
as
he
was
what
could
he
do
how
advance
their
common
end
but
by
passively
waiting
on
events
at
least
he
reflected
he
could
perform
the
trivial
service
of
trying
to
better
his
friend
case
and
this
he
eagerly
offered
to
attempt
the
doctor
thanked
him
but
without
any
great
appearance
of
emotion
odo
was
struck
by
the
change
which
had
transformed
a
heady
and
intemperate
speaker
into
a
model
of
philosophic
calm
the
doctor
indeed
seemed
far
more
concerned
for
the
safety
of
his
library
and
his
cabinet
of
minerals
than
for
his
own
happily
said
he
i
am
not
a
man
of
family
and
can
therefore
sacrifice
my
liberty
with
a
clear
conscience
a
fact
i
am
the
more
thankful
for
when
i
recall
the
moral
distress
of
our
poor
friend
vivaldi
when
compelled
to
desert
his
post
rather
than
be
separated
from
his
daughter
the
name
brought
the
colour
to
odo
brow
and
with
an
embarrassed
air
he
asked
what
news
the
doctor
had
of
their
friend
alas
said
the
other
the
last
was
of
his
death
which
happened
two
years
since
in
pavia
the
sardinian
government
had
as
you
probably
know
confiscated
his
small
property
on
his
leaving
the
state
and
i
am
told
he
died
in
great
poverty
and
in
sore
anxiety
for
his
future
he
added
that
these
events
had
taken
place
before
his
own
departure
from
turin
and
that
since
then
he
had
learned
nothing
of
fulvia
fate
save
that
she
was
said
to
have
made
her
home
with
an
aunt
who
lived
in
a
town
of
the
veneto
odo
listened
in
silence
the
lapse
of
time
and
the
absence
of
any
links
of
association
had
dimmed
the
girl
image
in
his
breast
but
at
the
mere
sound
of
her
name
it
lived
again
and
he
felt
her
interwoven
with
his
deepest
fibres
the
picture
of
her
father
death
and
of
her
own
need
filled
him
with
an
ineffectual
pity
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
of
seeking
her
out
but
the
other
could
recall
neither
the
name
of
the
town
she
had
removed
to
nor
that
of
the
relative
who
had
given
her
a
home
to
aid
the
good
doctor
was
a
simpler
business
the
intervention
of
de
crucis
and
odo
own
influence
sufficed
to
effect
his
release
and
on
the
payment
of
a
heavy
fine
in
which
odo
privately
assisted
him
he
was
reinstated
in
his
chair
the
only
promise
exacted
by
the
holy
office
was
that
he
should
in
future
avoid
propounding
his
own
views
on
questions
already
decided
by
scripture
and
to
this
he
readily
agreed
since
as
he
shrewdly
remarked
to
odo
his
opinions
were
now
and
any
who
wished
farther
instruction
had
only
to
apply
to
him
privately
the
old
duke
having
invited
odo
to
return
to
monte
alloro
with
such
treasures
as
he
had
collected
for
the
ducal
galleries
the
young
man
resolved
to
visit
rome
on
his
way
to
the
north
his
acquaintance
with
de
crucis
had
grown
into
something
like
friendship
since
their
joint
effort
in
behalf
of
the
imprisoned
sage
and
the
abate
preparing
to
set
out
about
the
same
time
the
two
agreed
to
travel
together
the
road
leading
from
naples
to
rome
was
at
that
time
one
of
the
worst
in
italy
and
was
besides
so
with
inns
that
there
was
no
inducement
to
linger
on
the
way
de
crucis
however
succeeded
in
enlivening
even
this
tedious
journey
he
was
a
good
linguist
and
a
sound
classical
scholar
besides
having
as
he
had
told
odo
a
pronounced
taste
for
antiquarian
research
in
addition
to
this
he
performed
agreeably
on
the
violin
and
was
with
the
history
of
music
his
chief
distinction
however
lay
in
the
ease
with
which
he
wore
his
accomplishments
and
in
a
breadth
of
view
that
made
it
possible
to
discuss
with
him
many
subjects
distasteful
to
most
men
of
his
cloth
the
sceptical
or
licentious
ecclesiastic
was
common
enough
but
odo
had
never
before
met
a
priest
who
united
serious
piety
with
this
indulgent
temper
or
who
had
learning
enough
to
do
justice
to
the
arguments
of
his
opponents
on
his
venturing
one
evening
to
compliment
de
crucis
on
these
qualities
the
latter
replied
with
a
smile
whatever
has
been
lately
advanced
against
the
jesuits
it
can
hardly
be
denied
that
they
were
good
and
it
is
to
them
i
owe
the
talents
you
have
been
pleased
to
admire
indeed
he

quietly
fingering
his

i
was
myself
bred
in

a
fact
i
do
not
often
make
known
in
the
present
heated
state
of
public
opinion
but
which
i
never
conceal
when
commended
for
any
quality
that
i
owe
to
the
society
rather
than
to
my
own
merit
surprise
for
the
moment
silenced
odo
for
though
it
was
known
that
italy
was
full
of
former
jesuits
who
had
been
permitted
to
remain
in
the
country
as
secular
priests
and
even
to
act
as
tutors
or
professors
in
private
families
he
had
never
thought
of
de
crucis
in
this
connection
the
latter
seeing
his
surprise
went
on
once
a
jesuit
always
a
jesuit
i
suppose
i
at
least
owe
the
society
too
much
not
to
own
my
debt
when
the
occasion
offers
nor
could
i
ever
see
the
force
of
the
charge
so
often
brought
against
us
that
we
sacrifice
everything
to
the
glory
of
the
order
for
what
is
the
glory
of
the
order
our
own
motto
has
declared
it
ad
majorem
dei
gloriam
who
works
for
the
society
works
for
its
master
if
our
zeal
has
been
sometimes
misdirected
our
blood
has
a
thousand
times
witnessed
to
its
sincerity
in
the
indies
in
america
in
england
during
the
great
persecution
and
lately
on
our
own
unnatural
coasts
the
jesuits
have
died
for
christ
as
joyfully
as
his
first
disciples
died
for
him
yet
these
are
but
a
small
number
in
comparison
with
the
countless
servants
of
the
order
who
labouring
in
far
countries
among
savage
peoples
or
surrounded
by
the
heretical
enemies
of
our
faith
have
died
the
far
bitterer
death
of
moral
isolation
setting
themselves
to
their
task
with
the
knowledge
that
their
lives
were
but
so
much
indistinguishable
dust
to
be
added
to
the
sum
of
human
effort
what
association
founded
on
human
interests
has
ever
commanded
such
devotion
and
what
merely
human
authority
could
count
on
such
unquestioning
obedience
not
in
a
mob
of
poor
illiterate
monks
but
in
men
chosen
for
their
capacity
and
trained
to
the
exercise
of
their
highest
faculties
yet
there
have
never
lacked
such
men
to
serve
the
order
and
as
one
of
our
enemies

noblest
enemy

he
did
not
again
revert
to
his
connection
with
the
jesuits
but
in
the
farther
course
of
their
acquaintance
odo
was
often
struck
by
the
firmness
with
which
he
testified
to
the
faith
that
was
in
him
without
using
the
jargon
of
piety
or
seeming
by
his
own
attitude
to
cast
a
reflection
on
that
of
others
he
was
indeed
master
of
that
worldly
science
which
the
jesuits
excelled
in
imparting
and
which
though
it
might
sink
to
hypocrisy
in
smaller
natures
became
in
a
spirit
the
very
flower
of
christian
courtesy
odo
had
often
spoken
to
de
crucis
of
the
luxurious
lives
led
by
many
of
the
monastic
orders
in
naples
it
might
be
true
enough
that
the
monks
themselves
and
even
their
abbots
fared
on
fish
and
vegetables
and
gave
their
time
to
charitable
and
educational
work
but
it
was
impossible
to
visit
the
famous
monastery
of
san
martino
or
that
of
the
carthusians
at
camaldoli
without
observing
that
the
anchoret
cell
had
expanded
into
a
delightful
apartment
with
bedchamber
library
and
private
chapel
and
his
into
a
princely
garden
de
crucis
admitted
the
truth
of
the
charge
explaining
it
in
part
by
the
character
of
the
neapolitan
people
and
by
the
tendency
of
the
northern
traveller
to
forget
that
such
apparent
luxuries
as
spacious
rooms
shady
groves
and
the
like
are
regarded
as
necessities
in
a
hot
climate
he
urged
moreover
that
the
monastic
life
should
not
be
judged
by
a
few
isolated
instances
and
on
the
way
to
rome
he
proposed
that
odo
by
way
of
seeing
the
other
side
of
the
question
should
visit
the
ancient
foundation
of
the
benedictines
on
monte
cassino
the
venerable
monastery
raised
on
its
height
over
the
busy
vale
of
garigliano
like
some
contemplative
spirit
above
the
conflicting
problems
of
life
might
well
be
held
to
represent
the
nobler
side
of
christian
celibacy
for
nearly
a
thousand
years
its
fortified
walls
had
been
the
stronghold
of
the
humanities
and
generations
of
students
had
cherished
and
added
to
the
treasures
of
the
famous
library
but
the
benedictine
rule
was
as
famous
for
good
works
as
for
learning
and
its
comparative
abstention
from
dogmatic
controversy
and
from
the
mechanical
devotion
of
some
of
the
other
orders
had
drawn
to
it
men
of
superior
mind
who
sought
in
the
monastic
life
the
free
exercise
of
the
noblest
activities
rather
than
a
sanctified
refuge
from
action
this
was
especially
true
of
the
monastery
of
monte
cassino
whither
many
scholars
had
been
attracted
and
where
the
fathers
had
long
had
the
highest
name
for
learning
and
beneficence
the
monastery
moreover
in
addition
to
its
charitable
and
educational
work
among
the
poor
maintained
a
school
of
theology
to
which
students
came
from
all
parts
of
italy
and
their
presence
lent
an
unwonted
life
to
the
great
labyrinth
of
courts
and
cloisters
the
abbot
with
whom
de
crucis
was
welcomed
the
travellers
warmly
making
them
free
of
the
library
and
the
archives
and
pressing
them
to
prolong
their
visit
under
the
spell
of
these
influences
they
lingered
on
from
day
to
day
and
to
odo
they
were
the
pleasantest
days
he
had
known
to
be
waked
before
dawn
by
the
bell
ringing
for
lauds
to
rise
from
the
narrow
bed
in
his
cell
and
opening
his
casement
look
forth
over
the
valley
the
dark
hills
of
the
abruzzi
and
the
remote
gleam
of
sea
touched
into
being
by
the
sunrise
to
hasten
through
hushed
echoing
corridors
to
the
church
where
in
a
grey
the
fathers
were
intoning
the
solemn
office
of
renewal
this
morning
ablution
of
the
spirit
so
like
the
bodily
plunge
into
clear
cold
water
seemed
to
attune
the
mind
to
the
fullest
enjoyment
of
what
was
to
follow
the
hours
of
study
the
talks
with
the
monks
the
strolls
through
cloister
or
garden
all
punctuated
by
the
recurring
summons
to
devotion
yet
for
all
its
latent
significance
it
remained
to
him
a
purely
sensuous
impression
the
vision
of
a
golden
leisure
not
a
solution
of
life
perplexities
but
at
best
an
honourable
escape
from
them
to
know
rome
is
to
have
assisted
at
the
councils
of
destiny
this
cry
of
a
more
famous
traveller
must
have
struggled
for
expression
in
breast
as
the
great
city
the
city
of
cities
laid
her
irresistible
hold
upon
him
his
first
impression
as
he
drove
in
the
clear
evening
light
from
the
porta
del
popolo
to
his
lodgings
in
the
via
sistina
was
of
a
prodigious
accumulation
of
architectural
effects
a
crowding
of
century
on
century
all
fused
in
the
crucible
of
the
roman
sun
so
that
each
style
seemed
linked
to
the
other
by
some
subtle
affinity
of
colour
nowhere
else
surely
is
the
traveller
first
sight
so
crowded
with
surprises
with
conflicting
challenges
to
eye
and
brain
here
as
he
passed
was
a
fragment
of
the
ancient
servian
wall
there
a
new
stucco
shrine
embedded
in
the
bricks
of
a
medieval
palace
on
one
hand
a
lofty
terrace
crowned
by
a
row
of
mouldering
busts
on
the
other
a
tower
with
machicolated
parapet
its
flanks
encrusted
with
bits
of
roman
sculpture
and
the
escutcheons
of
popes
opposite
perhaps
one
of
fuga
churches
with
windy
saints
blowing
out
of
their
niches
overlooked
the
nereids
of
a
barocco
fountain
or
an
old
house
propped
itself
like
a
palsied
beggar
against
a
row
of
corinthian
columns
while
everywhere
flights
of
steps
led
up
and
down
to
hanging
gardens
or
under
archways
and
each
turn
revealed
some
distant
glimpse
of
on
the
slope
of
a
vineyard
or
of
ruins
profiled
against
the
dim
reaches
of
the
campagna
afterward
as
order
was
born
out
of
chaos
and
he
began
to
thread
his
way
among
the
centuries
this
first
vision
lost
something
of
its
intensity
yet
it
was
always
to
the
last
through
the
eye
that
rome
possessed
him
her
life
indeed
as
though
in
obedience
to
such
a
setting
was
an
external
a
spectacular
business
from
the
wild
animation
of
the
in
the
forum
or
the
hucksters
traffic
among
the
fountains
of
the
piazza
navona
to
the
pompous
entertainments
in
the
cardinals
palaces
and
the
religious
ceremonies
and
processions
pius
in
the
reaction
from
ganganelli
democratic
ways
had
restored
the
pomp
and
ceremonial
of
the
vatican
with
the
religious
discipline
of
the
holy
office
and
never
perhaps
had
rome
been
more
splendid
on
the
surface
or
more
silent
and
empty
within
odo
at
times
as
he
moved
through
some
assemblage
of
cardinals
and
nobles
had
the
sensation
of
walking
through
a
huge
reverberating
palace
decked
out
with
all
the
splendours
of
art
but
long
since
abandoned
of
men
the
superficial
animation
the
taste
for
music
and
antiquities
all
the
dilettantisms
of
an
idle
and
irresponsible
society
seemed
to
him
to
shrivel
to
dust
in
the
glare
of
that
great
past
that
lit
up
every
corner
of
the
present
through
his
own
connections
and
the
influence
of
de
crucis
he
saw
all
that
was
best
not
only
among
the
nobility
but
in
that
ecclesiastical
life
now
more
than
ever
predominant
in
rome
here
at
last
he
was
face
to
face
with
the
mighty
sphinx
and
with
the
bleaching
bones
of
those
who
had
tried
to
guess
her
riddle
wherever
he
went
these
lost
adventurers
walked
the
streets
with
him
gliding
between
the
princes
of
the
church
in
the
ceremonies
of
saint
peter
and
the
lateran
or
mingling
in
the
company
that
ascended
the
state
staircase
at
some
cardinal
levee
he
met
indeed
many
accomplished
and
amiable
ecclesiastics
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
more
thoughtful
among
them
had
either
acquired
their
peace
of
mind
at
the
cost
of
a
certain
sensitiveness
or
had
taken
refuge
in
a
study
of
the
past
as
the
early
hermits
fled
to
the
desert
from
the
disorders
of
antioch
and
alexandria
none
seemed
disposed
to
face
the
actual
problems
of
life
and
this
attitude
of
caution
or
indifference
had
produced
a
stagnation
of
thought
that
contrasted
strongly
with
the
animation
of
sir
william
hamilton
circle
in
naples
the
result
in
odo
case
was
a
reaction
toward
the
pleasures
of
his
age
and
of
these
rome
had
but
few
to
offer
he
spent
some
months
in
the
study
of
the
antique
purchasing
a
few
good
examples
of
sculpture
for
the
duke
and
then
without
great
reluctance
set
out
for
monte
alloro
here
he
found
a
changed
atmosphere
the
duke
welcomed
him
handsomely
and
bestowed
the
highest
praise
on
the
rarities
he
had
collected
but
for
the
moment
the
court
was
ruled
by
a
new
favourite
to
whom
coming
was
obviously
unwelcome
this
adroit
adventurer
whose
name
was
soon
to
become
notorious
throughout
europe
had
taken
the
old
prince
by
his
darling
weaknesses
and
odo
having
no
mind
to
share
in
the
excesses
of
the
precious
couple
seized
the
first
occasion
to
set
out
again
on
his
travels
his
course
had
now
become
one
of
aimless
wandering
for
prudence
still
forbade
his
return
to
pianura
and
his
patron
indifference
left
him
free
to
come
and
go
as
he
chose
he
had
brought
from
rome
that
albergo
a
settled
melancholy
of
spirit
which
sought
refuge
in
such
distractions
as
the
moment
offered
in
such
a
mood
change
of
scene
was
a
necessity
and
he
resolved
to
employ
the
next
months
in
visiting
several
of
the
cities
toward
florence
he
was
specially
drawn
by
the
fact
that
alfieri
now
lived
there
but
as
often
happens
after
such
separations
the
reunion
was
a
disappointment
alfieri
indeed
warmly
welcomed
his
friend
but
he
was
engrossed
in
his
dawning
passion
for
the
countess
of
albany
and
that
lady
pitiable
situation
excluded
all
other
interests
from
his
mind
to
odo
to
whom
the
years
had
brought
an
increasing
detachment
this
seemed
an
arrest
in
growth
for
alfieri
early
worship
of
liberty
had
not
yet
found
its
destined
channel
of
expression
and
for
the
moment
his
enthusiasms
had
shrunk
to
the
compass
of
a
romantic
adventure
the
friends
parted
after
a
few
days
of
unsatisfying
intercourse
and
it
was
under
the
influence
of
this
final
disenchantment
that
odo
set
out
for
venice
it
was
the
vintage
season
and
the
travellers
descended
from
the
apennines
on
a
landscape
diversified
by
the
picturesque
incidents
of
the
on
every
slope
stood
some
villa
with
awnings
spread
and
merry
parties
were
picnicking
among
the
vines
or
watching
the
peasants
at
their
work
cantapresto
who
had
shown
great
reluctance
at
leaving
monte
alloro
where
as
he
declared
he
found
himself
as
snug
as
an
eel
in
a
pasty
was
now
all
eagerness
to
press
forward
and
odo
was
in
the
mood
to
allow
any
influence
to
decide
his
course
he
had
an
invaluable
courier
in
cantapresto
whose
enormous
pretensions
generally
assured
him
the
best
lodging
and
the
fastest
conveyance
to
be
obtained
and
who
was
never
happier
than
when
outwitting
a
rival
emissary
or
bribing
a
landlord
to
serve
up
on
odo
table
the
repast
ordered
in
advance
for
some
distinguished
traveller
his
impatience
to
reach
venice
which
he
described
as
the
scene
of
all
conceivable
delights
had
on
this
occasion
tripled
his
zeal
and
they
travelled
rapidly
to
padua
where
he
had
engaged
a
burchiello
for
the
passage
down
the
brenta
here
however
he
found
he
had
been
outdone
at
his
own
game
for
the
servant
of
an
english
duke
had
captured
the
burchiello
and
embarked
his
noble
party
before
cantapresto
reached
the
wharf
this
being
the
season
of
the
villeggiatura
when
the
venetian
nobility
were
exchanging
visits
on
the
mainland
every
conveyance
was
in
motion
and
no
other
boat
to
be
had
for
a
week
while
as
for
the
bucentaur
or
public
bark
which
was
just
then
getting
under
way
it
was
already
packed
to
the
gunwale
with
jews
pedlars
and
such
vermin
and
the
captain
swore
by
the
three
thousand
relics
of
saint
justina
that
he
had
no
room
on
board
for
so
much
as
a
hungry
flea
odo
who
had
accompanied
cantapresto
to
the
was
listening
to
these
assurances
and
to
the
soprano
vain
invectives
when
a
young
man
stepped
up
to
the
group
this
gentleman
whose
accent
and
dress
showed
him
to
be
a
frenchman
of
quality
told
odo
that
he
was
come
from
vicenza
whither
he
had
gone
to
engage
a
company
of
actors
for
his
friend
the
procuratore
bra
who
was
entertaining
a
distinguished
company
at
his
villa
on
the
brenta
that
he
was
now
returning
with
his
players
and
that
he
would
be
glad
to
convey
odo
so
far
on
his
road
to
venice
his
friend
seat
he
added
was
near
oriago
but
a
few
miles
above
fusina
where
a
public
conveyance
might
always
be
found
so
that
odo
would
doubtless
be
able
to
proceed
the
same
night
to
venice
this
civil
offer
odo
at
once
accepted
and
the
frenchman
thereupon
suggested
that
as
the
party
was
to
set
out
the
next
day
at
sunrise
the
two
should
sup
together
and
pass
the
intervening
hours
in
such
diversions
as
the
city
offered
they
returned
to
the
inn
where
the
actors
were
also
lodged
and
odo
host
having
ordered
a
handsome
supper
proposed
with
his
guest
permission
to
invite
the
leading
members
of
the
company
to
partake
of
it
he
departed
on
this
errand
and
great
was
odo
wonder
when
the
door
reopened
to
discover
among
the
party
it
admitted
his
old
acquaintance
of
vercelli
the
count
of
castelrovinato
the
latter
whose
dress
and
person
had
been
refurbished
and
who
now
wore
an
air
of
rakish
prosperity
greeted
him
with
evident
pleasure
and
while
their
entertainer
was
engaged
in
seating
the
ladies
of
the
company
gave
him
a
brief
account
of
the
situation
the
young
french
gentleman
whom
he
named
as
the
marquis
de
had
come
to
italy
some
months
previously
on
the
grand
tour
and
having
fallen
a
victim
to
the
charms
of
venice
had
declared
that
instead
of
continuing
on
his
travels
he
meant
to
complete
his
education
in
that
famous
school
of
pleasure
being
master
of
his
own
fortune
he
had
hired
a
palace
on
the
grand
canal
had
dispatched
his
governor
a
simple
archaeologist
on
a
mission
of
exploration
to
sicily
and
greece
and
had
devoted
himself
to
an
assiduous
study
of
venetian
manners
among
those
contributing
to
his
instruction
was
mirandolina
of
chioggia
who
had
just
completed
a
successful
engagement
at
the
theatre
of
san
moise
in
venice
wishing
to
detain
her
in
the
neighbourhood
her
adorer
had
prevailed
on
his
friend
the
procuratore
to
give
a
series
of
comedies
at
his
villa
of
bellocchio
and
had
engaged
to
provide
him
with
a
good
company
of
performers
miranda
was
of
course
selected
as
prima
amorosa
and
the
marquess
under
castelrovinato
guidance
had
then
set
out
to
collect
the
rest
of
the
company
this
he
had
succeeded
in
doing
and
was
now
returning
to
bellocchio
where
miranda
was
to
meet
them
odo
was
the
more
diverted
at
the
hazard
which
had
brought
him
into
such
company
as
the
procuratore
bra
was
one
of
the
noblemen
to
whom
the
old
duke
had
specially
recommended
him
on
learning
this
the
marquess
urged
him
to
present
his
letter
of
introduction
on
arriving
at
bellocchio
where
the
procuratore
who
was
noted
for
hospitality
to
strangers
would
doubtless
insist
on
his
joining
the
assembled
party
this
odo
declined
to
do
but
his
curiosity
to
see
mirandolina
made
him
hope
that
chance
would
soon
throw
him
in
the
procuratore
way
meanwhile
supper
was
succeeded
by
music
and
dancing
and
the
company
broke
up
only
in
time
to
proceed
to
the
where
their
barge
awaited
them
this
was
a
private
burchiello
of
the
procuratore
with
a
commodious
antechamber
for
the
servants
and
a
cabin
cushioned
in
damask
into
this
agreeable
retreat
the
actresses
were
packed
with
all
their
bags
and
and
their
being
rolled
into
pillows
they
were
soon
asleep
in
a
huddle
of
tumbled
finery
odo
and
his
host
preferred
to
take
the
air
on
deck
the
sun
was
rising
above
the
banks
of
the
brenta
and
it
was
pleasant
to
glide
in
the
clear
early
light
past
sleeping
gardens
and
villas
and
vineyards
where
the
peasants
were
already
at
work
the
wind
setting
from
the
sea
they
travelled
slowly
and
had
full
leisure
to
view
the
succession
of
splendid
seats
interspersed
with
gardens
the
thriving
villages
and
the
festooned
with
vines
spoke
eloquently
of
the
pleasures
to
be
enjoyed
in
this
delightful
season
of
the
villeggiatura
nowhere
said
he
do
people
take
their
pleasures
so
easily
and
naturally
as
in
venice
my
countrymen
claim
a
superiority
in
this
art
and
it
may
be
they
possessed
it
a
generation
ago
but
what
a
morose
place
is
france
become
since
philosophy
has
dethroned
enjoyment
if
you
go
on
a
visit
to
one
of
our
noblemen
seats
what
do
you
find
there
i
ask
cards
comedies
music
the
opportunity
for
an
agreeable
intrigue
in
the
society
of
your
equals
no
but
a
hostess
engaged
in
suckling
and
bathing
her
brats
or
in
studying
chemistry
and
optics
with
some
dirty
who
is
given
the
seat
of
honour
at
table
and
a
pavilion
in
the
park
to
which
he
may
retire
when
weary
of
the
homage
of
the
great
while
as
for
the
host
he
is
busy
discussing
education
or
political
economy
with
his
unfortunate
guests
if
indeed
he
is
not
dragging
them
through
leagues
of
mud
and
dust
to
inspect
his
latest
experiments
in
forestry
and
agriculture
or
to
hear
a
pack
of
snuffling
singing
hymns
to
the
god
of
nature
and
what
he
continued
is
the
result
of
it
all
the
peasants
are
starving
the
taxes
are
increasing
the
virtuous
landlords
are
ruining
themselves
in
farming
on
scientific
principles
the
tradespeople
are
grumbling
because
the
nobility
do
not
spend
their
money
in
paris
the
court
is
dull
the
clergy
are
furious
the
queen
mopes
the
king
is
frightened
and
the
whole
french
people
are
yawning
themselves
to
death
from
normandy
to
provence
yes
said
castelrovinato
with
his
melancholy
smile
the
test
of
success
is
to
have
had
one
money
worth
but
experience
which
is
dried
pleasure
is
at
best
a
dusty
diet
as
we
know
yonder
in
a
fold
of
those
hills
he
added
pointing
to
the
cluster
of
euganean
mountains
just
faintly
pencilled
above
the
plain
lies
the
little
fief
from
which
i
take
my
name
acre
by
acre
tree
by
tree
it
has
gone
to
pay
for
my
experiments
not
in
agriculture
but
in
pleasure
and
whenever
i
look
over
at
it
from
venice
and
reflect
on
what
each
rood
of
ground
or
trunk
of
tree
has
purchased
i
wonder
to
see
my
life
as
bare
as
ever
for
all
that
i
have
spent
on
it
the
young
marquess
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
would
your
life
he
exclaimed
have
been
a
whit
less
bare
had
you
passed
it
in
your
ancestral
keep
among
those
windy
hills
in
the
company
of
swineherds
and
with
a
for
your
mistress
and
the
village
priest
for
your
partner
at
picquet
perhaps
not
the
other
agreed
there
is
a
tale
of
a
man
who
spent
his
life
in
wishing
he
had
lived
differently
and
when
he
died
he
was
surrounded
by
a
throng
of
spectral
shapes
each
one
exactly
like
the
other
who
on
his
asking
what
they
were
replied
are
all
the
different
lives
you
might
have
lived
if
you
are
going
to
tell
cried
i
will
call
for
a
bottle
of
canary
and
i
rejoined
the
count
will
try
to
coax
the
ladies
forth
with
a
song
and
picking
up
his
lute
which
always
lay
within
reach
he
began
to
sing
in
the
venetian
dialect
there
a
villa
on
the
brenta
where
the
statues
white
as
snow
all
along
the
perch
like
in
a
row
there
a
garden
on
the
brenta
where
the
fairest
ladies
meet
picking
roses
from
the
trellis
for
the
gallants
at
their
feet
there
an
arbour
on
the
brenta
made
of
yews
that
screen
the
light
where
i
kiss
my
girl
at
midday
close
as
lovers
kiss
at
night
the
players
soon
emerged
at
this
call
and
presently
the
deck
resounded
with
song
and
laughter
all
the
company
were
familiar
with
the
venetian
bacaroles
and
castelrovinato
lute
was
passed
from
hand
to
hand
as
one
after
another
incited
by
the
marquess
canary
tried
to
recall
some
favourite
measure
la
biondina
in
gondoleta
or
guarda
che
bella
luna
meanwhile
life
was
stirring
in
the
villages
and
gardens
and
groups
of
people
appearing
on
the
terraces
overhanging
the
water
never
had
odo
beheld
a
livelier
scene
the
pillared
houses
with
their
rows
of
statues
and
vases
the
flights
of
marble
steps
descending
to
the
gilded
where
boats
bobbed
against
the
landings
and
boatmen
gasped
in
the
shade
of
their
awnings
the
marble
trellises
hung
with
grapes
the
gardens
where
parterres
of
flowers
and
gravel
alternated
with
the
dusk
of
tunnelled
the
company
playing
at
bowls
in
the
long
alleys
or
drinking
chocolate
in
gazebos
above
the
river
the
boats
darting
hither
and
thither
on
the
stream
itself
the
and
crowding
the
causeway
along
the
bank
all
were
unrolled
before
him
with
as
little
effect
of
reality
as
the
episodes
woven
in
some
tapestry
even
the
peasants
in
the
vineyards
seemed
as
merry
and
thoughtless
as
the
quality
in
their
gardens
the
is
the
holiday
of
the
rural
year
and
the
day
work
was
interspersed
with
frequent
intervals
of
relaxation
at
the
villages
where
the
burchiello
touched
for
refreshments
handsome
young
women
in
scarlet
bodices
came
on
board
with
baskets
of
melons
grapes
figs
and
peaches
and
under
the
trellises
on
the
landings
lads
and
girls
with
flowers
in
their
hair
were
dancing
the
monferrina
to
the
rattle
of
tambourines
or
the
chant
of
some
wandering
these
scenes
were
so
engaging
to
the
comedians
that
they
could
not
be
restrained
from
going
ashore
and
mingling
in
the
village
diversions
and
the
marquess
though
impatient
to
rejoin
his
divinity
was
too
volatile
not
to
be
drawn
into
the
adventure
the
whole
party
accordingly
disembarked
and
were
presently
giving
an
exhibition
of
their
talents
to
the
assembled
idlers
the
pantaloon
harlequin
and
doctor
enacting
a
comical
intermezzo
which
cantapresto
had
that
morning
composed
for
them
while
scaramouch
and
columbine
joined
the
dancers
and
the
rest
of
the
company
seizing
on
a
train
of
donkeys
laden
with
vegetables
for
the
venetian
market
stripped
these
patient
animals
of
their
panniers
and
mounting
them
bareback
started
a
corso
around
the
village
square
amid
the
invectives
of
the
drivers
and
the
applause
of
the
crowd
day
was
declining
when
the
marquess
at
last
succeeded
in
driving
his
flock
to
their
fold
and
the
moon
sent
a
quiver
of
brightness
across
the
water
as
the
burchiello
touched
at
the
landing
of
a
villa
set
amid
foliage
high
above
the
river
gardens
peopled
with
statues
descended
from
the
portico
of
the
villa
to
the
marble
platform
on
the
water
edge
where
a
throng
of
boatmen
in
the
procuratore
livery
hurried
forward
to
receive
the
marquess
and
his
companions
the
comedians
sobered
by
the
magnificence
of
their
surroundings
followed
their
leader
like
children
light
and
music
streamed
from
the
long
facade
overhead
but
the
lower
gardens
lay
hushed
and
dark
the
air
fragrant
with
unseen
flowers
the
late
moon
just
burnishing
the
edges
of
the
from
which
now
and
again
a
nightingale
song
gushed
in
a
fountain
of
sound
odo
spellbound
followed
the
others
without
a
thought
of
his
own
share
in
the
adventure
never
before
had
beauty
so
ministered
to
every
sense
he
felt
himself
lost
in
his
surroundings
absorbed
in
the
scent
and
murmur
of
the
night
on
the
upper
terrace
a
dozen
lacqueys
with
wax
lights
hastened
out
to
receive
the
travellers
a
laughing
group
followed
headed
by
a
tall
vivacious
woman
covered
with
jewels
whom
odo
guessed
to
be
the
procuratessa
bra
the
marquess
hastening
forward
kissed
the
hand
and
turned
to
summon
the
actors
who
hung
back
at
the
farther
end
of
the
terrace
the
light
from
the
windows
and
from
the
lacquey
tapers
fell
full
on
the
motley
band
and
odo
roused
to
the
singularity
of
his
position
was
about
to
seek
shelter
behind
the
pantaloon
when
he
heard
a
cry
of
recognition
and
mirandolina
darting
out
of
the
circle
fell
at
that
lady
feet
with
a
whispered
word
the
procuratessa
at
once
advanced
with
a
smile
of
surprise
and
bade
the
cavaliere
valsecca
welcome
seeing
odo
embarrassment
she
added
that
his
highness
of
monte
alloro
had
already
apprised
her
of
the
coming
and
that
she
and
her
husband
had
the
day
before
despatched
a
messenger
to
venice
to
enquire
if
he
were
already
there
to
invite
him
to
the
villa
at
the
same
moment
a
man
with
an
air
of
careless
kindly
strength
emerged
from
the
house
and
greeted
odo
i
am
happy
said
he
bowing
to
receive
at
bellocchio
a
member
of
the
princely
house
of
pianura
and
your
excellency
will
no
doubt
be
as
as
ourselves
that
accident
enables
us
to
make
acquaintance
without
the
formalities
of
an
introduction
this
then
was
the
famous
procuratore
bra
whose
house
had
given
three
doges
to
venice
and
who
was
himself
regarded
as
the
most
powerful
if
not
the
most
scrupulous
noble
of
his
day
odo
had
heard
many
tales
of
his
singularities
for
in
a
generation
of
elegant
triflers
his
figure
stood
out
with
the
ruggedness
of
a
granite
boulder
in
a
clipped
and
gravelled
garden
to
hereditary
wealth
and
influence
he
added
a
love
of
power
seconded
by
great
political
sagacity
and
an
inflexible
will
if
his
means
were
not
always
above
suspicion
they
at
least
tended
to
statesmanlike
ends
and
in
his
public
capacity
he
was
faithful
to
the
highest
interests
of
the
state
reports
differed
as
to
his
private
use
of
his
authority
he
was
noted
for
his
lavish
way
of
living
and
for
a
hospitality
which
distinguished
him
from
the
majority
of
his
class
who
however
showy
in
their
establishments
seldom
received
strangers
and
entertained
each
other
only
on
the
most
ceremonious
occasions
the
procuratore
kept
open
house
both
in
venice
and
on
the
brenta
and
in
his
the
foreign
traveller
was
welcomed
as
freely
as
in
paris
or
london
here
too
were
to
be
met
the
wits
musicians
and
literati
whom
a
traditional
morgue
still
excluded
from
many
aristocratic
houses
yet
in
spite
of
his
hospitality
or
perhaps
because
of
it
the
procuratore
as
odo
knew
was
the
butt
of
the
very
poets
he
entertained
and
the
worst
satirised
man
in
venice
it
was
his
misfortune
to
be
in
love
with
his
wife
and
this
state
of
mind
in
itself
sufficiently
ridiculous
and
the
shifts
and
compromises
to
which
it
reduced
him
were
a
source
of
endless
amusement
to
the
humorists
nor
were
graver
rumours
wanting
for
it
was
known
that
the
procuratore
so
proof
against
other
persuasions
was
helpless
in
his
wife
hands
and
that
honest
men
had
been
undone
and
scoundrels
exalted
at
a
nod
of
the
beautiful
procuratessa
that
lady
as
famous
in
her
way
as
her
husband
was
noted
for
quite
different
qualities
so
that
according
to
one
satirist
her
hospitality
began
where
his
ended
and
the
albergo
bra
the
nickname
their
palace
went
by
was
advertised
in
the
lampoons
of
the
day
as
furnishing
both
bed
and
board
in
some
respects
however
the
tastes
of
the
noble
couple
agreed
both
delighting
in
music
wit
good
company
and
all
the
adornments
of
life
while
with
regard
to
their
private
conduct
it
doubtless
suffered
by
being
viewed
through
the
eyes
of
a
narrow
and
trivial
nobility
apt
to
look
with
suspicion
on
any
deviation
from
the
customs
of
their
class
such
was
the
household
in
which
odo
found
himself
unexpectedly
included
he
learned
that
his
hosts
were
in
the
act
of
entertaining
the
english
duke
who
had
captured
his
burchiello
that
morning
and
having
exchanged
his
for
a
more
suitable
toilet
he
was
presently
conducted
to
the
private
theatre
where
the
company
had
gathered
to
witness
an
improvised
performance
by
mirandolina
and
the
actors
the
procuratessa
at
once
beckoned
him
to
the
row
of
gilt
armchairs
where
she
sat
with
the
noble
duke
and
several
ladies
of
distinction
the
little
theatre
sparkled
with
reflected
in
the
facets
of
glass
chandeliers
and
in
the
jewels
of
the
company
and
odo
was
struck
by
the
refined
brilliancy
of
the
scene
before
he
had
time
to
look
about
him
the
curtains
of
the
stage
were
drawn
back
and
mirandolina
flashed
into
view
daring
and
radiant
as
ever
and
dressed
with
an
elegance
which
spoke
well
for
the
liberality
of
her
new
protector
she
was
as
much
at
her
ease
as
before
the
vulgar
audience
of
vercelli
and
spite
of
the
distinguished
eyes
fixed
upon
her
her
smiles
and
sallies
were
pointedly
addressed
to
odo
this
made
him
the
object
of
the
procuratessa
banter
but
had
an
opposite
effect
on
the
marquess
who
fixed
him
with
an
irritated
eye
and
fidgeted
restlessly
in
his
seat
as
the
performance
went
on
when
the
curtain
fell
the
procuratessa
led
the
company
to
the
circular
saloon
which
as
in
most
villas
of
the
venetian
mainland
formed
the
central
point
of
the
house
if
odo
had
been
charmed
by
the
graceful
decorations
of
the
theatre
he
was
dazzled
by
the
airy
splendour
of
this
apartment
was
pouring
from
the
arched
recesses
above
the
doorways
and
chandeliers
of
coloured
murano
glass
diffused
a
soft
brightness
over
the
pilasters
of
the
stuccoed
walls
and
the
floor
of
inlaid
marbles
on
which
couples
were
rapidly
forming
for
the
contradance
his
eye
however
was
soon
drawn
from
these
to
the
ceiling
which
overarched
the
dancers
with
what
seemed
like
an
olympian
revel
reflected
in
sunset
clouds
over
the
gilt
balustrade
surmounting
the
cornice
lolled
the
figures
of
fauns
bacchantes
nereids
and
tritons
hovered
over
by
a
cloud
of
amorini
blown
like
across
a
rosy
sky
while
in
the
centre
of
the
dome
apollo
burst
in
his
chariot
through
the
mists
of
dawn
escorted
by
a
fantastic
procession
of
the
human
races
these
alien
subjects
of
the
sun
a
laplander
a
turbaned
figure
on
a
dromedary
a
blackamoor
and
a
plumed
american
indian
were
in
turn
surrounded
by
a
rout
of
maenads
and
silenuses
whose
flushed
advance
was
checked
by
the
breaking
of
cool
green
waves
through
which
boys
wreathed
with
coral
and
seaweed
disported
themselves
among
shoals
of
flashing
dolphins
it
was
as
though
the
genius
of
pleasure
had
poured
all
the
riches
of
his
inexhaustible
realm
on
the
heads
of
the
revellers
below
the
procuratessa
brought
odo
to
earth
by
remarking
that
it
was
a
of
the
divine
tiepolo
he
was
admiring
she
added
that
at
bellocchio
all
formalities
were
dispensed
with
and
begged
him
to
observe
that
in
the
rooms
opening
into
the
saloon
recreations
were
provided
for
every
taste
in
one
of
these
apartments
silver
trays
were
set
out
with
sherbets
cakes
and
fruit
cooled
in
snow
while
in
another
stood
around
which
the
greater
number
of
the
company
were
already
gathering
for
tresette
a
third
room
was
devoted
to
music
and
hither
mirandolina
who
was
evidently
allowed
a
familiarity
of
intercourse
not
accorded
to
the
other
comedians
had
withdrawn
with
the
pacified
marquess
and
perched
on
the
arm
of
a
high
gilt
chair
was
pinching
the
strings
of
a
guitar
and
humming
the
first
notes
of
a
boatman
song
after
completing
the
circuit
of
the
rooms
odo
stepped
out
on
the
terrace
which
was
now
bathed
in
the
whiteness
of
a
soaring
moon
the
colonnades
detached
against
foliage
the
gardens
spectrally
outspread
seemed
to
enclose
him
in
a
magic
circle
of
loveliness
which
the
first
ray
of
daylight
must
dispel
he
wandered
on
drawn
to
the
depths
of
shade
on
the
lower
terraces
the
hush
grew
deeper
the
murmur
of
the
river
more
mysterious
a
invited
him
and
he
seated
himself
on
the
bench
niched
in
its
inmost
dusk
seen
through
the
black
arch
of
the
arbour
the
moonlight
lay
like
snow
on
parterres
and
statues
he
thought
of
maria
clementina
and
of
the
delight
she
would
have
felt
in
such
a
scene
as
he
had
just
left
then
the
remembrance
of
mirandolina
blandishments
stole
over
him
and
spite
of
himself
he
smiled
at
the
marquess
discomfiture
though
he
was
in
no
humour
for
an
intrigue
his
fancy
was
not
proof
against
the
romance
of
his
surroundings
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
miranda
eyes
had
never
been
so
bright
or
her
smile
so
full
of
provocation
no
wonder
frattanto
followed
her
like
a
lost
soul
and
the
marquess
abandoned
rome
and
baalbec
to
sit
at
the
feet
of
such
a
teacher
had
not
that
light
philosopher
after
all
chosen
the
true
way
and
guessed
the
riddle
why
should
today
always
be
jilted
for
tomorrow
sensation
sacrificed
to
thought
as
he
sat
revolving
these
questions
the
seemed
to
stir
and
from
some
deeper
recess
of
shade
a
figure
stole
to
his
side
he
started
but
a
hand
was
laid
on
his
lips
and
he
was
gently
forced
back
into
his
seat
dazzled
by
the
outer
moonlight
he
could
just
guess
the
outline
of
the
figure
pressed
against
his
own
he
sat
speechless
yielding
to
the
charm
of
the
moment
till
suddenly
he
felt
a
rapid
kiss
and
the
visitor
vanished
as
mysteriously
as
she
had
come
he
sprang
up
to
follow
but
inclination
failed
with
his
first
step
let
the
spell
of
mystery
remain
unbroken
he
sank
down
on
the
seat
again
lulled
by
dreamy
musings
when
he
looked
up
the
moonlight
had
faded
and
he
felt
a
chill
in
the
air
he
walked
out
on
the
terrace
the
moon
hung
low
and
the
were
beginning
to
tremble
the
was
grey
with
oblongs
of
yellow
light
marking
the
windows
of
the
as
he
looked
up
at
it
the
ceased
and
not
a
sound
was
heard
but
the
stir
of
the
foliage
and
the
murmur
of
the
river
against
its
banks
then
from
a
loggia
above
the
central
portico
a
woman
clear
contralto

took
flight
before
the

up
with

the
shadowy

slumbrous

crushed
by
the
hours
melodious
feet
from
bloodless
the
days
at
bellocchio
passed
in
a
series
of
festivities
the
mornings
were
spent
in
drinking
chocolate
strolling
in
the
gardens
and
visiting
the
meanders
and
other
wonders
of
the
villa
thence
the
greater
number
of
guests
were
soon
drawn
to
the
from
which
they
rose
only
to
dine
and
after
an
elaborate
dinner
prepared
by
a
french
cook
the
whole
company
set
out
to
explore
the
country
or
to
exchange
visits
with
the
hosts
of
the
adjoining
villas
each
evening
brought
some
fresh
diversion
a
comedy
or
an
operetta
in
the
miniature
theatre
an
al
fresco
banquet
on
the
terrace
or
a
ball
attended
by
the
principal
families
of
the
neighbourhood
odo
soon
contrived
to
reassure
the
marquess
as
to
his
designs
upon
miranda
and
when
was
not
at
cards
the
two
young
men
spent
much
of
their
time
together
the
marquess
was
never
tired
of
extolling
the
taste
and
ingenuity
with
which
the
venetians
planned
and
carried
out
their
recreations
nature
herself
said
he
seems
the
accomplice
of
their
and
in
no
other
surroundings
could
man
natural
craving
for
diversion
find
so
graceful
and
poetic
an
expression
the
scene
on
which
they
looked
out
seemed
to
confirm
his
words
it
was
the
last
evening
of
their
stay
at
bellocchio
and
the
procuratessa
had
planned
a
musical
festival
on
the
river
festoons
of
coloured
lanterns
wound
from
the
portico
to
the
water
and
opposite
the
landing
lay
the
procuratore
bucentaur
a
great
barge
hung
with
crimson
velvet
in
the
prow
were
stationed
the
comedians
in
airy
mythological
dress
and
as
the
guests
stepped
on
board
they
were
received
by
miranda
a
rosy
venus
who
escorted
by
mars
and
adonis
recited
an
ode
composed
by
cantapresto
in
the
procuratessa
honour
a
banquet
was
spread
in
the
which
was
hung
with
silk
arras
and
venetian
mirrors
and
while
the
guests
feasted
dozens
of
little
boats
hung
with
lights
and
filled
with
musicians
flitted
about
the
bucentaur
like
a
swarm
of
musical
fireflies
the
next
day
odo
accompanied
the
procuratessa
to
venice
had
he
been
a
traveller
from
beyond
the
alps
he
could
hardly
have
been
more
unprepared
for
the
spectacle
that
awaited
him
in
aspect
and
customs
venice
differed
almost
as
much
from
other
italian
cities
as
from
those
of
the
rest
of
europe
from
the
fanciful
stone
embroidery
of
her
churches
and
palaces
to
a
hundred
singularities
in
dress
and
manners
the
wigs
and
long
gowns
of
the
nobles
the
black
mantles
and
of
the
ladies
the
white
masks
worn
abroad
by
both
sexes
the
publicity
of
social
life
under
the
arcades
of
the
piazza
the
extraordinary
freedom
of
intercourse
in
the
casini
and
theatres
the
city
proclaimed
in
every
detail
of
life
and
architecture
her
independence
of
any
tradition
but
her
own
this
was
the
more
singular
as
saint
mark
square
had
for
centuries
been
the
of
east
and
west
and
the
goal
of
artists
scholars
and
from
all
parts
of
the
world
indeed
as
pointed
out
the
venetian
customs
almost
appeared
to
have
been
devised
for
the
convenience
of
strangers
the
privilege
of
going
masked
at
almost
all
seasons
and
the
enforced
uniformity
of
dress
which
in
itself
provided
a
kind
of
incognito
made
the
place
singularly
favourable
to
every
kind
of
intrigue
and
amusement
while
the
mild
temper
of
the
people
and
the
watchfulness
of
the
police
prevented
the
public
disorders
that
such
license
might
have
occasioned
these
seeming
anomalies
abounded
on
every
side
from
the
where
a
tinker
might
set
a
ducat
against
a
prince
it
was
but
a
few
steps
to
the
broglio
or
arcade
under
the
ducal
palace
into
which
no
plebeian
might
intrude
while
the
nobility
walked
there
the
great
ladies
who
were
subject
to
strict
sumptuary
laws
and
might
not
display
their
jewels
or
try
the
new
french
fashions
but
on
the
sly
were
yet
privileged
at
all
hours
to
go
abroad
alone
in
their
gondolas
no
society
was
more
haughty
and
exclusive
in
its
traditions
yet
the
mask
leveled
all
classes
and
permitted
during
the
greater
part
of
the
year
an
equality
of
intercourse
undreamed
of
in
other
cities
while
the
nobles
though
more
magnificently
housed
than
in
any
other
capital
of
europe
generally
sought
amusement
at
the
public
casini
or
instead
of
receiving
company
in
their
own
palaces
such
were
but
a
few
of
the
contradictions
in
a
city
where
the
theatres
were
named
after
the
neighbouring
churches
where
there
were
innumerable
religious
foundations
but
scarce
an
ecclesiastic
to
be
met
in
company
and
where
the
ladies
of
the
laity
dressed
like
nuns
while
the
nuns
in
the
aristocratic
convents
went
in
gala
habits
and
with
uncovered
heads
no
wonder
that
to
the
bewildered
stranger
the
venetians
seemed
to
keep
perpetual
carnival
and
venice
herself
to
be
as
it
were
the
mere
stage
of
some
huge
comic
interlude
to
odo
the
setting
was
even
more
astonishing
than
the
performance
never
had
he
seen
pleasure
and
grace
so
happily
allied
all
the
arts
of
life
so
combined
in
the
single
effort
after
enjoyment
here
was
not
a
mere
tendency
to
linger
on
the
surface
but
the
essence
of
superficiality
itself
not
an
ignoring
of
what
lies
beneath
but
an
elimination
of
it
as
though
all
human
experience
should
be
beaten
thin
and
spread
out
before
the
eye
like
some
brilliant
tenuous
plaque
of
etruscan
gold
and
in
this
science
of
pleasure
mere
jeweller
work
though
it
were
the
greatest
artists
had
collaborated
each
contributing
his
page
to
the
philosophy
of
enjoyment
in
the
form
of
some
radiant
allegory
flowering
from
palace
wall
or
ceiling
like
the
enlarged
reflection
of
the
life
beneath
it
nowhere
was
the
mind
arrested
by
a
question
or
an
idea
thought
slunk
away
like
an
unmasked
guest
at
the
ridotto
sensation
ruled
supreme
and
each
moment
was
an
iridescent
bubble
from
the
lips
of
fancy
odo
brought
to
the
spectacle
the
humour
best
fitted
for
its
enjoyment
his
weariness
and
discouragement
sought
refuge
in
the
emotional
satisfaction
of
the
hour
here
at
least
the
old
problem
of
living
had
been
solved
and
from
the
patrician
taking
the
air
in
his
gondola
to
the
gondolier
himself
gambling
and
singing
on
the
of
his
master
palace
all
seemed
equally
satisfied
with
the
solution
now
if
ever
was
the
time
to
cry
halt
to
the
present
to
forget
the
travelled
road
and
take
no
thought
for
the
morrow
the
months
passed
rapidly
and
agreeably
the
procuratessa
was
the
most
amiable
of
guides
and
in
her
company
odo
enjoyed
the
best
that
venice
had
to
offer
from
the
matchless
music
of
the
churches
and
hospitals
to
the
petits
soupers
in
the
private
casini
of
the
nobility
while
and
castelrovinato
introduced
him
to
scenes
where
even
a
lady
of
the
procuratessa
intrepidity
might
not
venture
such
a
life
left
little
time
for
thoughtful
pleasures
nor
did
odo
find
in
the
society
about
him
any
sympathy
with
his
more
personal
tastes
at
first
he
yielded
willingly
enough
to
the
pressure
of
his
surroundings
glad
to
escape
from
thoughts
of
the
past
and
speculations
about
the
future
but
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
lose
his
footing
in
such
an
element
and
at
times
he
felt
the
lack
of
such
companionship
as
de
crucis
had
given
him
there
was
no
society
in
venice
corresponding
with
the
polished
circles
of
milan
or
naples
or
with
the
academic
class
in
such
university
towns
as
padua
and
pavia
the
few
venetians
destined
to
be
remembered
among
those
who
had
contributed
to
the
intellectual
advancement
of
italy
vegetated
in
obscurity
suffering
not
so
much
from
religious
persecution
for
the
inquisition
had
little
power
in
venice
as
from
the
incorrigible
indifference
of
a
society
which
ignored
all
who
did
not
contribute
to
its
amusement
odo
indeed
might
have
sought
out
these
unhonoured
prophets
but
that
all
the
influences
about
him
set
the
other
way
and
that
he
was
falling
more
and
more
into
the
habit
of
running
with
the
tide
now
and
then
however
a
vague
ennui
drove
him
to
one
of
the
bookshops
which
throughout
italy
were
the
chief
of
students
and
authors
on
one
of
these
occasions
the
dealer
invited
him
into
a
private
room
where
he
kept
some
rare
volumes
and
here
odo
was
surprised
to
meet
andreoni
the
liberal
bookseller
of
pianura
andreoni
at
first
seemed
somewhat
disconcerted
by
the
meeting
but
presently
recovering
his
confidence
he
told
odo
that
he
had
been
recently
banished
from
pianura
the
cause
of
his
banishment
being
the
publication
of
a
book
on
taxation
that
was
supposed
to
reflect
on
the
fiscal
system
of
the
duchy
though
he
did
not
name
the
author
odo
at
once
suspected
gamba
but
on
his
enquiring
if
the
latter
had
also
been
banished
andreoni
merely
replied
that
he
had
been
dismissed
from
his
post
and
had
left
pianura
the
bookseller
went
on
to
say
that
he
had
come
to
venice
with
the
idea
of
setting
up
his
press
either
there
or
in
padua
where
his
wife
family
lived
odo
was
eager
to
hear
more
but
andreoni
courteously
declined
to
wait
on
him
at
his
lodgings
on
the
plea
that
it
might
harm
them
both
to
be
seen
together
they
agreed
however
to
meet
in
san
zaccaria
after
low
mass
the
next
morning
and
here
andreoni
gave
odo
a
fuller
report
of
recent
events
in
the
duchy
it
appeared
that
in
the
incessant
of
party
influences
the
church
had
once
more
gained
on
the
liberals
trescorre
was
out
of
favour
the
dominican
had
begun
to
show
his
hand
more
openly
and
the
duke
more
than
ever
apprehensive
about
his
health
was
seeking
to
conciliate
heaven
by
his
renewed
persecution
of
the
reformers
in
the
general
upheaval
even
crescenti
had
nearly
lost
his
place
and
it
was
rumoured
that
he
kept
it
only
through
the
intervention
of
the
pope
who
had
represented
to
the
duke
that
the
persecution
of
a
scholar
already
famous
throughout
europe
would
reflect
little
credit
on
the
church
as
for
gamba
andreoni
though
unwilling
to
admit
a
knowledge
of
his
exact
whereabouts
assured
odo
that
he
was
well
and
had
not
lost
courage
at
court
matters
remained
much
as
usual
the
duchess
surrounded
by
her
familiars
had
entered
on
a
new
phase
of
mad
expenditure
draining
the
exchequer
to
indulge
her
private
whims
filling
her
apartments
with
mountebanks
and
players
and
borrowing
from
courtiers
and
servants
to
keep
her
creditors
from
the
door
trescorre
was
no
longer
able
to
check
her
extravagance
and
his
influence
with
the
duke
being
on
the
wane
the
court
was
once
more
the
scene
of
unseemly
scandals
and
disorders
the
only
new
figure
to
appear
there
since
odo
departure
was
that
of
the
little
prince
governor
who
had
come
from
rome
a
few
months
previously
to
superintend
the
heir
education
which
was
found
to
have
been
grievously
neglected
under
his
former
masters
this
was
an
ecclesiastic
an
as
some
said
but
without
doubt
a
man
of
parts
and
apparently
of
more
tolerant
views
than
the
other
churchmen
about
the
court
but
andreoni
added
your
excellency
may
chance
to
recall
him
for
he
is
the
same
abate
de
crucis
who
was
sent
to
pianura
by
the
holy
office
to
arrest
the
german
astrologer
odo
heard
him
with
surprise
he
had
had
no
news
of
de
crucis
since
their
parting
in
rome
where
as
he
supposed
the
latter
was
to
remain
for
some
years
in
the
service
of
prince
bracciano
odo
was
at
a
loss
to
conceive
how
or
why
the
jesuit
had
come
to
pianura
but
whatever
his
reasons
for
being
there
it
was
certain
that
his
influence
must
make
itself
felt
far
beyond
the
range
of
his
immediate
duties
whether
this
influence
would
be
exerted
for
good
or
ill
it
was
impossible
to
forecast
but
much
as
odo
admired
de
crucis
he
could
not
forget
that
the
jesuit
by
his
own
avowal
was
still
the
servant
of
the
greatest
organised
opposition
to
moral
and
intellectual
freedom
that
the
world
had
ever
known
that
this
opposition
was
not
always
actively
manifested
odo
was
well
aware
he
knew
that
the
jesuit
spirit
moved
in
many
directions
and
that
its
action
was
often
more
beneficial
than
that
of
its
opponents
but
it
remained
an
incalculable
element
in
the
composition
of
human
affairs
and
one
the
more
to
be
feared
since
in
ceasing
to
have
a
material
existence
it
had
acquired
the
dread
pervasiveness
of
an
idea
with
the
epiphany
the
wild
set
in
nothing
could
surpass
the
excesses
of
this
mad
time
all
classes
seemed
bitten
by
the
tarantula
of
mirth
every
gondola
hid
an
intrigue
the
tabarro
concealed
a
noble
lady
the
feminine
hood
and
cloak
a
young
spark
bent
on
mystification
the
friar
habit
a
man
of
pleasure
and
the
nun
veil
a
lady
of
the
town
the
piazza
swarmed
with
of
all
degrees
the
square
itself
was
taken
up
by
the
booths
of
hucksters
and
astrologers
while
promenaders
in
travesty
thronged
the
arcades
and
the
ladies
of
the
nobility
in
their
white
masks
and
black
zendaletti
surveyed
the
scene
from
the
windows
of
the
in
the
procuratie
or
threading
the
crowd
on
the
arms
of
their
gallants
visited
the
various
and
flocked
about
the
rhinoceros
exhibited
in
a
great
canvas
tent
in
the
piazzetta
the
characteristic
contrasts
of
venetian
life
seemed
to
be
emphasised
by
the
vagaries
of
the
carnival
and
odo
never
ceased
to
be
diverted
by
the
sight
of
a
long
line
of
masqueraders
in
every
kind
of
comic
disguise
kneeling
devoutly
before
the
shrine
of
the
virgin
under
the
arches
of
the
procuratie
while
the
friar
who
led
their
devotions
interrupted
his
litany
whenever
the
quack
on
an
adjoining
platform
began
to
bawl
through
a
tin
trumpet
the
praise
of
his
miraculous
pills
the
mounting
madness
culminated
on
giovedi
grasso
the
last
thursday
before
lent
when
the
piazzetta
became
the
scene
of
ceremonies
in
which
the
doge
himself
took
part
these
opened
with
the
decapitation
of
three
bulls
a
rite
said
to
commemorate
some
dispute
between
the
inveterate
enemies
venice
and
aquileia
the
bulls
preceded
by
halberdiers
and
trumpeters
and
surrounded
by
armed
attendants
were
led
in
state
before
the
ducal
palace
and
the
executioner
practised
in
his
bloody
work
struck
off
each
head
with
a
single
stroke
of
his
huge
sword
this
slaughter
was
succeeded
by
pleasanter
sights
such
as
the
famous
vola
or
flight
of
a
boy
from
the
of
saint
mark
to
a
window
of
the
palace
where
he
presented
a
nosegay
to
his
serenity
and
was
caught
up
again
to
his
airy
after
this
ingenious
feat
came
another
called
the
force
of
hercules
given
by
a
band
of
youths
who
building
themselves
into
a
kind
of
pyramid
shifted
their
postures
with
inexhaustible
agility
while
bursts
of
fireworks
wove
yellow
arches
through
the
midday
light
meanwhile
the
crowds
in
the
streets
fled
this
way
and
that
as
a
throng
of
uproarious
young
fellows
drove
before
them
the
bulls
that
were
to
be
baited
in
the
open
squares
and
wherever
a
recessed
doorway
or
the
angle
of
a
building
afforded
shelter
from
the
rout
some
or
had
gathered
a
crowd
about
his
carpet
ash
wednesday
brought
about
a
dramatic
transformation
every
travesty
laid
aside
every
tent
and
stall
swept
away
the
people
again
gathered
in
the
piazza
to
receive
the
ashes
of
penitence
on
their
heads
the
churches
now
became
the
chief
centres
of
interest
venice
was
noted
for
her
sacred
music
and
for
the
lavish
illumination
of
her
favourite
shrines
and
chapels
and
few
religious
spectacles
were
more
impressive
than
the
forty
hours
devotion
in
the
wealthier
churches
of
the
city
all
the
magic
of
music
painting
and
sculpture
were
combined
in
the
service
of
religion
and
odo
sense
of
the
dramatic
quality
of
the
catholic
rites
found
gratification
in
the
moving
scenes
where
amid
the
imperishable
splendours
of
his
own
creation
man
owned
himself
but
dust
never
before
had
he
been
so
alive
to
the
symbolism
of
the
penitential
season
so
awed
by
the
beauty
and
symmetry
of
that
great
structure
of
the
liturgical
year
that
leads
the
soul
up
step
by
step
to
the
awful
heights
of
calvary
the
very
carelessness
of
those
about
him
seemed
to
deepen
the
solemnity
of
the
scenes
enacted
as
though
the
church
after
all
her
centuries
of
dominion
were
still
as
in
those
early
days
but
a
voice
crying
in
the
wilderness
the
easter
bells
ushered
in
the
reign
of
another
spirit
if
the
carnival
folly
was
spent
the
joy
of
returning
life
replaced
it
after
the
winter
diversions
of
cards
concerts
and
theatres
came
the
excursions
to
the
of
the
lagoon
and
the
evening
promenade
of
the
fresca
on
the
grand
canal
now
the
were
hung
with
awnings
the
oleanders
in
the
balconies
grew
rosy
against
the
marble
and
yellow
blossomed
from
the
crumbling
walls
the
brought
early
fruits
and
vegetables
from
the
brenta
and
roses
and
from
the
paduan
gardens
and
when
the
wind
set
from
shore
it
carried
with
it
the
scent
of
and
flowering
fields
now
also
was
the
season
when
the
great
civic
and
religious
processions
took
place
dyeing
the
water
with
sunset
hues
as
they
swept
from
the
steps
of
the
piazzetta
to
san
giorgio
the
redentore
or
the
salute
in
the
fashionable
convents
the
nuns
celebrated
the
festivals
of
their
patron
saints
with
musical
and
dramatic
entertainments
to
which
secular
visitors
were
invited
these
entertainments
were
a
noted
feature
of
venetian
life
and
the
subject
of
much
scandalous
comment
among
visitors
from
beyond
the
alps
the
nuns
of
the
stricter
orders
were
as
closely
cloistered
as
elsewhere
but
in
the
convents
of
santa
croce
santa
chiara
and
a
few
others
mostly
filled
by
the
daughters
of
the
nobility
an
unusual
liberty
prevailed
it
was
known
that
the
inmates
had
taken
the
veil
for
family
reasons
and
to
the
indulgent
venetian
temper
it
seemed
natural
that
their
seclusion
should
be
made
as
little
irksome
as
possible
as
a
rule
the
privileges
accorded
to
the
nuns
consisted
merely
in
their
being
allowed
to
receive
visits
in
the
presence
of
a
and
to
perform
in
concerts
on
the
of
the
order
but
some
few
convents
had
a
name
for
far
greater
license
and
it
was
a
common
thing
for
the
noble
libertine
returned
from
italy
to
boast
of
his
intrigue
with
a
venetian
nun
odo
in
the
procuratessa
train
had
of
course
visited
many
of
the
principal
convents
whether
it
were
owing
to
the
malicious
pleasure
of
contrasting
their
own
state
with
that
of
their
cloistered
sisters
or
to
the
discreet
shelter
which
the
parlour
afforded
to
their
private
intrigues
the
venetian
ladies
were
exceedingly
partial
to
these
visits
the
procuratessa
was
no
exception
to
the
rule
and
as
was
natural
to
one
of
her
complexion
she
preferred
the
convents
where
the
greatest
freedom
prevailed
odo
however
had
hitherto
found
little
to
tempt
him
in
these
glimpses
of
forbidden
fruit
the
nuns
though
often
young
and
pretty
had
the
insipidity
of
women
secluded
from
the
passions
and
sorrows
of
life
without
being
raised
above
them
and
he
preferred
the
frank
coarseness
of
the
procuratessa
circle
to
the
simpering
graces
of
the
cloister
even
mysterious
boast
of
a
conquest
he
had
made
among
the
sisters
failed
to
excite
his
friend
curiosity
the
marquess
though
still
devoted
to
miranda
was
too
much
the
child
of
his
race
not
to
seek
variety
in
his
emotions
indeed
he
often
declared
that
the
one
fault
of
the
italian
character
was
its
unimaginative
fidelity
in
does
a
man
he
asked
dine
off
one
dish
at
a
gourmet
banquet
and
why
should
i
restrict
myself
to
one
course
at
the
most
table
in
europe
one
must
love
at
least
two
women
to
appreciate
either
and
did
the
silly
creatures
but
know
it
a
rival
becomes
them
like
a
patch
sister
mary
of
the
crucifix
he
went
on
to
explain
possessed
the
very
qualities
that
miranda
lacked
the
daughter
of
a
rich
nobleman
of
treviso
she
was
skilled
in
music
drawing
and
all
the
operations
of
the
needle
and
was
early
promised
in
marriage
to
a
young
man
whose
estates
adjoined
her
father
the
jealousy
of
a
younger
sister
who
was
secretly
in
love
with
the
suitor
caused
her
to
accuse
mistress
of
misconduct
and
thus
broke
off
the
marriage
and
the
unhappy
girl
repudiated
by
her
bridegroom
was
at
once
despatched
to
a
convent
in
venice
enraged
at
her
fate
she
had
repeatedly
appealed
to
the
authorities
to
release
her
but
her
father
wealth
and
influence
prevailed
against
all
her
efforts
the
abbess
however
felt
such
pity
for
her
that
she
was
allowed
more
freedom
than
the
other
nuns
with
whom
her
wit
and
beauty
made
her
a
favourite
in
spite
of
her
exceptional
privileges
these
as
hinted
included
the
liberty
of
leaving
the
convent
after
to
visit
her
friends
and
he
professed
to
be
one
of
those
whom
she
had
thus
honoured
always
eager
to
have
his
good
taste
ratified
by
the
envy
of
his
friends
he
was
urgent
with
odo
to
make
the
lady
acquaintance
and
it
was
agreed
that
on
the
first
favourable
occasion
a
meeting
should
take
place
at
casino
the
weeks
elapsed
however
without
odo
hearing
further
of
the
matter
and
it
had
nearly
passed
from
his
mind
when
one
august
day
he
received
word
that
the
marquess
hoped
for
his
company
that
evening
he
was
in
that
mood
of
careless
acquiescence
when
any
novelty
invites
and
the
heavy
warmth
of
the
summer
night
seemed
the
accomplice
of
his
humour
cloaked
and
masked
he
stepped
into
his
gondola
and
was
swept
rapidly
along
the
grand
canal
and
through
winding
channels
to
the
giudecca
it
was
close
on
midnight
and
all
venice
was
abroad
gondolas
laden
with
musicians
and
hung
with
coloured
lamps
lay
beneath
the
palace
windows
or
drifted
out
on
the
oily
reaches
of
the
lagoon
there
was
no
moon
and
the
were
dark
and
noiseless
but
for
the
hundreds
of
caged
nightingales
that
made
every
byway
musical
as
his
prow
slipped
past
garden
walls
and
under
the
blackness
of
bridges
odo
felt
the
fathomless
mystery
of
the
venetian
night
not
the
open
night
of
the
lagoons
but
the
secret
dusk
of
nameless
waterways
between
blind
windows
and
complaisant
gates
at
one
of
these
his
gondola
presently
touched
the
gate
was
cautiously
unbarred
and
odo
found
himself
in
a
strip
of
garden
preceding
a
low
pavilion
in
which
not
a
light
was
visible
a
led
him
indoors
and
the
marquess
greeted
him
on
the
threshold
you
are
late
he
exclaimed
i
began
to
fear
you
would
not
be
here
to
receive
our
guests
with
me
your
guests
odo
repeated
i
had
fancied
there
was
but
one
the
marquess
smiled
my
dear
mary
of
the
crucifix
he
said
is
too
to
venture
out
alone
at
this
late
hour
and
has
prevailed
on
her
bosom
friend
to
accompany
besides
he
added
with
his
deprecating
shrug
i
own
i
have
had
too
recent
an
experience
of
your
success
to
trust
you
alone
with
my
enchantress
and
she
has
promised
to
bring
the
most
fascinating
nun
in
the
convent
to
protect
her
from
your
wiles
as
he
spoke
he
led
odo
into
a
room
furnished
in
the
luxurious
style
of
a
french
boudoir
a
savonnerie
carpet
covered
the
floor
the
lounges
and
were
heaped
with
cushions
and
the
panels
hung
with
pastel
drawings
of
a
lively
or
sentimental
character
the
windows
toward
the
garden
were
but
those
on
the
farther
side
of
the
room
stood
open
on
a
starlit
terrace
whence
the
eye
looked
out
over
the
lagoon
to
the
outer
line
of
islands
confess
cried
pointing
to
a
table
set
with
delicacies
and
flanked
by
silver
that
i
have
spared
no
pains
to
do
my
goddess
honour
and
that
this
interior
must
present
an
agreeable
contrast
to
the
whitewashed
cells
and
dismal
refectory
of
her
convent
no
passion
he
continued
with
his
quaint
didactic
air
is
so
susceptible
as
love
to
the
influence
of
its
surroundings
and
principles
which
might
have
held
out
against
a
sofa
and
soupe
a
have
before
now
been
known
to
succumb
to
silk
cushions
and
champagne
he
received
with
perfect
the
retort
that
if
he
failed
in
his
designs
his
cook
and
his
upholsterer
would
not
be
to
blame
and
the
young
men
were
still
engaged
in
such
banter
when
the
servant
returned
to
say
that
a
gondola
was
at
the
the
marquess
hastened
out
and
presently
reappeared
with
two
masked
and
hooded
figures
the
first
of
these
whom
he
led
by
the
hand
entered
with
the
air
of
one
not
unaccustomed
to
her
surroundings
but
the
other
hung
back
and
on
the
marquess
inviting
them
to
unmask
hurriedly
signed
to
her
friend
to
refuse
very
well
fair
strangers
said
with
a
laugh
if
you
insist
on
prolonging
our
suspense
we
shall
avenge
ourselves
by
prolonging
yours
and
neither
my
friend
nor
i
will
unmask
till
you
are
pleased
to
set
us
the
example
the
first
lady
echoed
his
laugh
shall
i
own
she
cried
that
i
suspect
in
this
unflattering
compliance
a
pretext
to
conceal
your
friend
features
from
me
as
long
as
possible
for
my
part
she
continued
throwing
back
her
hood
the
mask
of
hypocrisy
i
am
compelled
to
wear
in
the
convent
makes
me
hate
every
form
of
disguise
and
with
all
my
defects
i
prefer
to
be
known
as
i
am
and
with
that
she
detached
her
mask
and
dropped
the
cloak
from
her
shoulders
the
gesture
revealed
a
beauty
of
the
laughing
sensuous
type
best
suited
to
such
surroundings

of
the
crucifix
in
her
sumptuous
gown
of
with
pearls
wound
through
her
reddish
hair
and
hanging
on
her
bare
shoulders
might
have
stepped
from
some
festal
canvas
of
bonifazio
she
had
laid
aside
even
the
light
gauze
veil
worn
by
the
nuns
in
gala
habit
and
no
vestige
of
her
calling
showed
itself
in
dress
or
bearing

you
accept
my
challenge
cavaliere
she
exclaimed
turning
on
odo
a
glance
confident
of
victory
the
marquess
meanwhile
had
approached
the
other
nun
with
the
intention
of
inducing
her
to
unmask
but
as
sister
mary
of
the
crucifix
advanced
to
perform
the
same
service
for
his
friend
his
irrepressible
jealousy
made
him
step
hastily
between
them

cavaliere
he
cried
drawing
odo
gaily
toward
the
unknown
nun
since
you
have
induced
one
of
our
fair
guests
to
unmask
perhaps
you
may
be
equally
successful
with
the
other
who
appears
provokingly
indifferent
to
my
advances
the
masked
nun
had
in
fact
retreated
to
a
corner
of
the
room
and
stood
there
drawing
her
cloak
about
her
rather
in
the
attitude
of
a
frightened
child
than
in
that
of
a
lady
bent
on
a
gallant
adventure

of
the
crucifix
approached
her
playfully
my
dear
sister
veronica
said
she
throwing
her
arm
about
the
other
neck
hesitates
to
reveal
charms
which
she
knows
must
cast
mine
in
the
shade
but
i
am
not
to
be
outdone
in
generosity
and
if
the
marquess
will
unmask
his
friend
i
will
do
the
same
by
mine
as
she
spoke
she
deftly
pinioned
the
nun
hands
and
snatched
off
her
mask
with
a
malicious
laugh
the
marquess
entering
into
her
humour
removed
odo
at
the
same
instant
and
the
latter
turning
with
a
laugh
found
himself
face
to
face
with
fulvia
vivaldi
he
grew
white
and
mary
of
the
crucifix
sprang
forward
to
catch
her
friend
good
god
what
is
this
gasped
the
marquess
staring
from
one
to
the
other
a
glance
of
entreaty
from
fulvia
checked
the
answer
on
odo
lips
and
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
in
the
room
then
fulvia
breaking
away
from
her
companion
fled
out
on
the
terrace
the
other
was
about
to
follow
but
odo
controlling
himself
stepped
between
them
madam
said
he
in
a
low
voice
i
recognise
in
your
companion
a
friend
of
whom
i
have
long
had
no
word
will
you
pardon
me
if
i
speak
with
her
alone
sister
mary
drew
back
with
a
meaning
sparkle
in
her
handsome
eyes
why
this
she
cried
not
without
a
touch
of
resentment
is
the
prettiest
ending
imaginable
but
what
a
sly
creature
to
be
sure
to
make
me
think
it
was
her
first
assignation
odo
without
answering
hastened
out
on
the
terrace
it
was
so
dark
after
the
brightly
lit
room
that
for
a
moment
he
did
not
distinguish
the
figure
which
had
sprung
to
the
low
parapet
above
the
water
and
he
stumbled
forward
just
in
time
to
snatch
fulvia
back
to
safety
this
is
madness
he
cried
as
she
hung
upon
him
trembling
the
boat
she
stammered
in
a
strange
sobbing
voice
the
boat
should
be
somewhere
below
the
boat
lies
at
the
on
the
other
side
he
answered
she
drew
away
from
him
with
a
gesture
of
despair
the
struggle
with
sister
mary
had
disordered
her
hair
and
it
fell
on
her
white
neck
in
loosened
strands
my
cloak
my
mask
she
faltered
vaguely
clasping
her
hands
across
her
bosom
then
suddenly
dropped
to
a
seat
and
burst
into
tears
once
before
but
in
how
different
a
case
he
had
seen
her
thus
thrilled
with
weeping
then
fate
had
thrown
him
humbled
at
her
feet
now
it
was
she
who
cried
him
mercy
in
every
line
of
her
bowed
head
and
shaken
breast
and
the
thought
of
that
other
meeting
flooded
his
heart
with
pity
he
knelt
before
her
seeking
her
hands
fulvia
why
do
you
shrink
from
me
he
whispered
but
she
shook
her
head
and
wept
on
at
last
her
sobs
subsided
and
she
rose
to
her
feet
i
must
go
back
said
she
in
a
low
tone
and
would
have
passed
him
back
to
the
convent
to
the
convent
she
said
after
him
but
she
made
no
farther
effort
to
move
the
question
that
tortured
him
sprang
forth
you
have
taken
the
vows
a
month
since
she
answered
he
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
for
a
moment
both
were
silent
and
you
have
no
other
word
for
me
none
he
faltered
at
last
she
fixed
him
with
a
hard
bright
stare
yes
one
she
cried
keep
a
place
for
me
among
your
gallant
recollections
fulvia
he
said
with
sudden
strength
and
caught
her
by
the
arm
let
me
pass
she
cried
no
by
heaven
he
retorted
not
till
you
listen
to
me
not
till
you
tell
me
how
it
is
that
i
come
upon
you
here
ah
child
he
broke
out
do
you
fancy
i
do
see
how
little
you
belong
in
such
scenes
that
i
do
know
you
are
here
through
some
dreadful
error
fulvia
he
pleaded
will
you
never
trust
me
and
at
the
word
he
burned
with
blushes
in
the
darkness
his
voice
perhaps
rather
than
what
he
said
seemed
to
have
struck
a
yielding
fibre
he
felt
her
arm
tremble
in
his
hold
but
after
a
moment
she
said
with
cruel
distinctness
there
was
no
error
i
came
knowingly
it
was
the
company
and
not
the
place
i
was
deceived
in
odo
drew
back
with
a
start
then
as
if
in
spite
of
himself
he
broke
into
a
laugh
by
the
saints
said
he
almost
joyously
i
am
sorry
to
be
where
i
am
not
wanted
but
since
no
better
company
offers
will
you
not
make
the
best
of
mine
and
suffer
me
to
hand
you
in
to
supper
with
our
friends
and
with
a
low
bow
he
offered
her
his
arm
the
effect
was
instantaneous
he
saw
her
catch
at
the
balustrade
for
support
sancta
simplicitas
he
exulted
and
did
you
think
to
play
the
part
at
such
short
notice
he
fell
at
her
feet
and
covered
her
hands
with
kisses
my
fulvia
my
poor
child
come
with
me
come
away
from
here
he
entreated
i
know
not
what
mad
hazard
has
brought
us
thus
together
but
i
thank
god
on
my
knees
for
the
encounter
you
shall
tell
me
all
or
nothing
as
you
please
you
shall
presently
dismiss
me
at
your
and
never
see
me
again
if
you
so
will
it
but
till
then
i
swear
you
are
in
my
charge
and
no
human
power
shall
come
between
us
as
he
ended
the
marquess
voice
called
gaily
through
the
open
window
friends
the
burgundy
is
uncorked
will
you
not
join
us
in
a
glass
of
good
french
wine
fulvia
flung
herself
upon
odo
yes
yes
away
take
me
away
from
here
she
cried
clinging
to
him
she
had
gathered
her
cloak
about
her
and
drawn
the
hood
over
her
disordered
hair
away
away
she
repeated
i
can
not
see
them
again
good
god
is
there
no
other
way
out
with
a
gesture
he
warned
her
to
be
silent
and
drew
her
along
the
terrace
in
the
shadow
of
the
house
the
gravel
creaked
beneath
their
feet
and
she
shook
at
the
least
sound
but
her
hand
lay
in
his
like
a
child
and
he
felt
himself
her
master
at
the
farther
end
of
the
terrace
a
flight
of
steps
led
to
a
narrow
strip
of
shore
he
helped
her
down
and
after
listening
a
moment
gave
a
whistle
presently
they
heard
a
low
plash
of
oars
and
saw
the
prow
of
a
gondola
cautiously
rounding
the
angle
of
the
terrace
the
water
was
shallow
and
the
boatmen
proceeded
slowly
and
at
length
paused
a
few
yards
from
the
land
we
can
come
no
nearer
one
of
them
called
what
is
it
your
mistress
is
unwell
and
wishes
to
return
odo
answered
and
catching
fulvia
in
his
arms
he
waded
out
with
her
to
the
gondola
and
lifted
her
over
the
side
to
santa
chiara
he
ordered
as
he
laid
her
on
the
cushions
beneath
the
felze
and
the
boatmen
recognising
her
as
one
of
their
late
fares
without
more
ado
began
to
row
rapidly
toward
the
city
in
the
pitying
darkness
of
the
gondola
she
lay
beyond
speech
her
hand
in
his
her
breath
coming
fitfully
odo
waited
in
suspense
not
daring
to
question
her
yet
sure
that
if
she
did
not
speak
then
she
would
never
do
so
all
doubt
and
perplexity
of
spirit
had
vanished
in
the
simple
sense
of
her
nearness
the
throb
of
her
hand
in
his
was
like
the
of
hope
he
felt
himself
no
longer
a
drifting
spectator
of
life
but
a
sharer
in
its
gifts
and
renunciations
which
this
meeting
would
bring
he
dared
not
yet
surmise
it
was
enough
that
he
was
with
fulvia
and
that
love
had
freed
his
spirit
at
length
she
began
to
speak
her
agitation
was
so
great
that
he
had
difficulty
in
piecing
together
the
fragments
of
her
story
but
for
the
moment
he
was
more
concerned
in
regaining
her
confidence
than
in
seeking
to
obtain
a
clear
picture
of
the
past
before
she
could
end
the
gondola
rounded
the
corner
of
the
narrow
canal
skirting
the
of
santa
chiara
alarmed
lest
he
should
lose
her
again
he
passionately
urged
her
to
receive
him
on
the
morrow
and
after
some
hesitation
she
consented
a
moment
later
their
prow
touched
the
postern
and
the
boatman
gave
a
low
call
which
proved
him
no
novice
at
the
business
fulvia
signed
to
odo
not
to
speak
or
move
and
they
sat
listening
intently
for
the
opening
of
the
gate
as
soon
as
it
was
unbarred
she
sprang
ashore
and
vanished
in
the
darkness
of
the
garden
and
with
a
cold
sense
of
failure
odo
heard
the
bolt
slipping
back
and
the
stealthy
fall
of
the
oars
as
the
gondola
slid
away
under
the
shadow
of
the
whither
was
he
being
carried
and
would
that
bolt
ever
be
drawn
for
him
again
in
the
sultry
dawn
the
convent
loomed
forbiddingly
as
a
prison
and
he
could
hardly
believe
that
a
few
hours
earlier
the
very
doors
now
closed
against
him
had
stood
open
to
all
the
world
they
would
open
again
but
whether
to
him
who
could
conjecture
he
was
resolved
to
see
fulvia
again
but
he
shrank
from
the
thought
of
forcing
himself
upon
her
she
had
promised
to
receive
him
but
what
revulsion
of
feeling
might
not
the
morrow
bring
unable
to
sleep
he
bade
the
boatmen
carry
him
to
the
lido
the
sun
was
just
rising
above
the
friulian
alps
and
the
lagoon
lay
dull
and
smooth
as
a
mirror
as
he
paced
the
lonely
sands
he
tried
to
reconstruct
fulvia
broken
story
supplementing
it
with
such
details
as
his
experience
of
venetian
life
suggested
it
appeared
that
after
her
father
death
she
had
found
herself
possessed
of
a
small
sum
of
money
which
he
had
painfully
accumulated
for
her
during
the
two
years
they
had
spent
in
pavia
her
only
thought
was
to
employ
this
inheritance
in
publishing
the
great
work
on
the
origin
of
civilisation
which
vivaldi
had
completed
a
few
days
before
his
last
seizure
through
one
of
the
professors
of
the
university
who
had
been
her
father
friend
she
negotiated
with
a
printer
of
amsterdam
for
the
production
of
the
book
and
the
terms
being
agreed
on
despatched
the
money
and
the
manuscript
thither
by
a
sure
hand
both
were
duly
delivered
and
the
publisher
had
advanced
so
far
in
his
work
as
to
send
fulvia
the
of
the
first
chapters
when
he
took
alarm
at
the
renewed
activity
of
the
holy
office
in
france
and
italy
declared
there
would
be
no
market
for
the
book
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
and
refused
either
to
continue
printing
it
or
to
restore
the
money
which
he
said
had
barely
covered
the
of
the
type
fulvia
then
attempted
to
recover
the
manuscript
but
the
publisher
refusing
to
surrender
it
she
found
herself
doubly
beggared
at
a
stroke
in
this
extremity
she
turned
to
a
sister
of
her
father
who
lived
near
treviso
and
this
excellent
woman
though
persuaded
that
her
heretical
views
had
doomed
him
to
everlasting
torment
did
not
scruple
to
offer
his
child
a
home
here
fulvia
had
lived
for
two
years
when
her
aunt
sudden
death
left
her
destitute
for
the
good
lady
to
atone
for
having
given
shelter
to
a
niece
of
doubtful
orthodoxy
had
left
the
whole
of
her
small
property
to
the
church
fulvia
only
other
relations
were
certain
distant
cousins
of
her
mother
members
of
the
venetian
nobility
but
of
the
indigent
class
called
barnabotti
who
lived
on
the
bounty
of
the
state
while
in
treviso
she
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
one
of
these
cousins
a
stirring
noisy
fellow
involved
in
all
the
political
agitations
of
the
state
it
was
among
the
barnabotti
the
class
most
indebted
to
the
government
that
these
seditious
movements
generally
arose
and
cousin
was
one
of
the
most
notorious
malcontents
of
his
order
she
had
mistaken
his
revolutionary
bluster
for
philosophic
enlightenment
and
persuaded
that
he
shared
in
her
views
she
rashly
appealed
to
him
for
help
with
the
most
eloquent
expressions
of
sympathy
he
offered
her
a
home
under
his
own
roof
but
on
reaching
venice
she
was
but
by
his
wife
and
family
who
made
no
scruple
of
declaring
that
being
but
pensioners
themselves
they
were
in
no
state
to
nourish
their
pauper
relatives
fulvia
could
not
but
own
that
they
were
right
for
they
lived
in
the
garret
of
a
house
pawning
their
very
beds
to
pay
for
ices
in
the
piazza
and
sitting
at
home
all
the
week
in
dirty
shifts
and
that
they
might
go
to
mass
in
silk
and
powder
on
a
sunday
after
two
months
of
wretchedness
with
these
unfriendly
hosts
whom
she
vainly
tried
to
conciliate
by
a
hundred
little
services
and
attentions
the
poor
girl
resolved
to
return
to
milan
where
she
hoped
to
obtain
some
menial
position
in
the
household
of
one
of
her
father
friends
her
cousins
at
this
made
a
great
outcry
protesting
that
none
of
their
blood
should
so
demean
herself
and
that
they
would
spare
no
efforts
to
find
some
better
way
of
providing
for
her
their
noble
connections
gave
fulvia
the
hope
that
they
might
obtain
a
small
pension
for
her
and
she
unsuspiciously
yielded
to
their
wishes
but
to
her
dismay
she
learned
a
few
weeks
later
that
thanks
to
their
exertions
she
was
to
be
admitted
as
a
novice
to
the
convent
of
santa
chiara
though
it
was
the
common
way
of
disposing
of
portionless
girls
the
liberal
views
of
her
cousins
had
reassured
fulvia
and
she
woke
to
her
fate
too
late
to
escape
it
she
was
to
enter
on
her
novitiate
on
the
morrow
but
even
had
delay
been
possible
she
knew
that
both
the
civil
and
religious
authorities
would
sustain
her
family
in
their
course
her
cousins
knowing
her
independent
spirit
and
perhaps
fearing
an
outcry
if
they
sequestered
her
too
closely
had
thought
to
soften
her
resistance
by
placing
her
in
a
convent
noted
for
its
leniencies
but
to
fulvia
such
surroundings
were
more
repugnant
than
the
strictest
monastic
discipline
the
corruption
of
the
religious
orders
was
a
favourite
topic
with
her
father
friends
and
the
venetian
nuns
were
noted
throughout
italy
for
their
frivolous
and
dissipated
lives
but
nothing
that
fulvia
had
heard
or
imagined
approached
the
realities
that
awaited
her
at
first
the
mere
sense
of
imprisonment
of
being
cut
off
forever
from
the
world
of
free
thought
and
action
which
had
been
her
native
element
overwhelmed
every
other
feeling
and
she
lay
numb
in
the
clutch
of
fate
but
she
was
too
young
for
this
merciful
torpor
to
last
and
with
the
returning
consciousness
of
her
situation
came
the
instinctive
effort
to
amend
it
how
she
longed
then
to
have
been
buried
in
some
strict
order
where
she
might
have
spent
her
days
in
solitary
work
and
meditation
how
she
loathed
the
petty
gossip
of
the
nuns
their
furtive
reaching
after
forbidden
pleasures
the
blindest
bigotry
would
have
been
less
insufferable
than
this
clandestine
commerce
with
the
world
the
strictest
sequestration
than
this
open
parody
of
the
monastic
calling
she
sought
in
vain
among
her
companions
for
an
answering
mind
many
like
herself
were
in
open
rebellion
against
their
lot
but
for
reasons
so
different
that
the
feeling
was
an
added
estrangement
at
last
the
longing
to
escape
every
other
sensation
it
became
a
fixed
idea
a
devouring
passion
she
did
not
trust
herself
to
think
of
what
must
follow
but
centred
every
faculty
on
the
effort
of
evasion
at
this
point
in
her
story
her
growing
distress
had
made
it
hard
for
odo
to
gather
more
than
a
general
hint
of
her
meaning
it
was
clear
however
that
she
had
found
her
sole
hope
of
escape
lay
in
gaining
the
friendship
of
one
of
the
more
favoured
nuns
her
own
position
in
the
community
was
of
the
humblest
for
she
had
neither
rank
nor
wealth
to
commend
her
but
her
skill
on
the
harpsichord
had
attracted
the
notice
of
the
and
she
had
been
enrolled
in
the
convent
orchestra
before
her
novitiate
was
over
this
had
brought
her
into
contact
with
a
few
of
the
more
favoured
sisters
and
among
them
she
had
recognised
in
sister
mary
of
the
crucifix
the
daughter
of
the
nobleman
who
had
been
her
aunt
landlord
at
treviso
fulvia
name
was
not
unknown
to
the
handsome
nun
and
the
coincidence
was
enough
to
draw
them
together
in
a
community
where
such
trivial
affinities
must
replace
the
ties
of
nature
fulvia
soon
learned
that
mary
of
the
crucifix
was
the
spoiled
darling
of
the
convent
her
beauty
and
spirit
as
much
perhaps
as
her
family
connections
had
given
her
this
predominance
and
no
scruples
interfered
with
her
use
of
it
finding
herself
as
she
declared
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
grate
she
determined
to
gather
in
all
the
pleasures
she
could
reach
through
it
and
her
reach
was
certainly
prodigious
here
odo
had
been
obliged
to
fall
back
on
his
knowledge
of
venetian
customs
to
conjecture
the
incidents
leading
up
to
the
scene
of
the
previous
night
he
divined
that
fulvia
maddened
by
having
had
to
pronounce
the
irrevocable
vows
had
resolved
to
fly
at
all
hazards
that
sister
mary
unconscious
of
her
designs
had
proposed
to
take
her
on
a
party
of
pleasure
and
that
the
rash
girl
blind
to
every
risk
but
that
of
delay
had
seized
on
this
desperate
means
of
escape
what
must
have
followed
had
she
not
chanced
on
odo
she
had
clearly
neither
the
courage
nor
the
experience
to
picture
but
she
seemed
to
have
had
some
confused
idea
of
throwing
herself
on
the
mercy
of
the
foreign
nobleman
she
believed
she
was
to
meet
so
much
odo
had
gathered
and
her
voice
her
gesture
the
disorder
of
her
spirit
supplied
what
her
words
omitted
not
for
a
moment
either
in
listening
to
her
or
in
the
soberer
period
of
revision
did
he
question
the
exact
truth
of
her
narrative
it
was
the
second
time
that
they
had
met
under
strange
circumstances
yet
now
as
before
the
sense
of
her
candour
was
his
ruling
thought
he
concluded
that
whatever
plight
she
found
herself
in
she
would
be
its
immediate
justification
and
felt
sure
he
must
have
reached
this
conclusion
though
love
had
not
had
a
stake
in
the
verdict
this
perhaps
but
proved
him
the
more
deeply
taken
for
it
is
when
passion
tightens
the
net
that
reason
flaps
her
wings
most
loudly
day
was
high
when
he
returned
to
his
lodgings
impatient
for
a
word
from
fulvia
none
had
come
and
as
the
hours
passed
he
yielded
to
the
most
disheartening
fancies
his
wretchedness
was
increased
by
the
thought
that
he
had
once
inflicted
on
her
such
suspense
he
was
now
enduring
and
he
went
so
far
as
to
wonder
if
this
were
her
revenge
for
vercelli
but
if
the
past
was
intolerable
to
consider
the
future
was
all
baffling
fears
his
immediate
study
was
how
to
see
her
and
this
her
continued
silence
seemed
to
refuse
him
the
extremity
of
her
plight
was
his
best
ally
yet
here
again
anxiety
suggested
that
his
having
been
the
witness
of
her
humiliation
must
insensibly
turn
her
against
him
never
perhaps
does
a
man
show
less
knowledge
of
human
nature
than
in
speculating
on
the
conduct
of
his
beloved
and
every
step
in
the
labyrinth
of
his
conjectures
carried
odo
farther
from
the
truth
this
rose
on
him
at
nightfall
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
slipped
in
his
hand
by
a
as
he
crossed
the
square
before
his
lodgings
he
stepped
to
the
light
of
the
nearest
shrine
and
read
the
few
words
in
a
tumult
this
being
friday
no
visitors
are
admitted
to
the
convent
but
i
entreat
you
to
come
to
me
tomorrow
an
hour
before
benediction
a
postcript
added
it
is
the
hour
when
visitors
are
most
frequent
he
saw
her
meaning
in
a
flash
his
best
chance
of
speaking
with
her
was
in
a
crowd
and
his
heart
bounded
at
the
significance
of
her
admission
now
indeed
he
felt
himself
lord
of
the
future
nothing
counted
but
that
he
was
to
see
her
his
horizon
was
narrowed
to
the
bars
through
which
her
hand
would
greet
him
yet
never
had
the
world
appeared
so
vast
long
before
the
hour
appointed
he
was
at
the
gate
of
santa
chiara
he
asked
to
speak
with
sister
veronica
and
the
portress
led
him
to
the
parlour
several
nuns
were
already
behind
the
grate
chatting
with
a
group
of
fashionable
ladies
and
their
gallants
but
fulvia
was
not
among
them
in
a
few
moments
the
portress
returned
and
informed
odo
that
sister
veronica
was
indisposed
and
unable
to
leave
her
cell
his
heart
sank
and
he
asked
if
she
had
sent
no
message
the
portress
answered
in
the
negative
but
added
that
the
abbess
begged
him
to
come
to
her
parlour
and
at
this
his
hopes
took
wing
again
the
abbess
parlour
was
preceded
by
a
handsome
antechamber
where
odo
was
bidden
to
wait
it
was
doubtless
the
reverend
mother
hour
for
receiving
company
for
through
the
door
beyond
he
heard
laughter
and
music
and
the
sound
of
lively
talk
presently
this
door
opened
and
mary
of
the
crucifix
entered
in
her
monastic
habit
she
looked
coarse
and
overblown
the
severe
lines
and
sober
tints
of
the
dress
did
not
become
her
odo
felt
an
insurmountable
repugnance
at
seeing
her
he
could
not
conceive
why
fulvia
had
chosen
such
an
intermediary
and
for
the
first
time
a
stealing
doubt
tainted
his
thoughts
of
her
sister
mary
seemed
to
read
his
mind
you
bear
me
a
grudge
said
she
gaily
but
i
think
you
will
live
to
own
that
i
do
not
return
it
come
with
me
if
you
wish
to
speak
with
sister
veronica
odo
flushed
with
surprise
she
is
not
too
unwell
to
receive
me
sister
mary
raised
her
eyebrows
in
astonishment
to
receive
her
cousin
her
nearest
male
relative
come
from
treviso
purposely
to
visit
her
the
saints
forbid
she
cried
the
poor
child
is
indeed
dying
but
only
to
see
her
cousin
and
with
that
she
seized
his
hand
and
hurried
him
down
the
corridor
to
a
door
on
which
she
tapped
three
times
it
opened
at
once
and
catching
odo
by
the
shoulder
she
pushed
him
laughingly
over
the
threshold
and
cried
out
as
she
vanished
be
careful
not
to
agitate
the
sufferer
odo
found
himself
in
a
neat
plain
cell
but
he
had
no
eyes
for
his
surroundings
all
that
he
saw
was
fulvia
dressed
in
her
nun
habit
and
seated
near
the
window
through
which
the
afternoon
light
fell
softly
on
her
white
coif
and
the
austere
folds
of
her
dress
she
rose
and
greeted
him
with
a
smile
you
are
not
ill
then
he
cried
stupidly
and
the
colour
rose
to
her
pale
face
no
she
said
i
am
not
ill
and
at
first
i
was
reluctant
to
make
use
of
such
a
subterfuge
but
to
feign
an
indisposition
was
the
only
way
of
speaking
with
you
privately
and
alas
in
this
school
one
soon
becomes
a
proficient
in
deceit
she
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
with
an
effort
even
this
favour
i
could
not
have
obtained
save
through
sister
mary
of
the
crucifix
but
she
now
understands
that
you
are
an
old
friend
of
my
father
and
that
my
motive
for
wishing
to
see
you
is
not
what
she
at
first
supposed
this
was
said
with
such
noble
simplicity
and
so
direct
a
glance
that
odo
confused
by
the
sense
of
his
own
doubts
could
only
murmur
as
he
bent
over
her
hand
fuoco
di
quest
incendio
non
v
assale
she
drew
back
gently
and
signed
him
to
a
seat
i
trust
not
she
said
answering
his
citation
but
i
think
the
flame
through
which
beatrice
walked
must
have
been
less
contaminating
than
this
morass
in
which
i
flounder
she
was
silent
a
moment
and
he
had
leisure
to
steal
a
closer
look
at
her
it
was
the
first
time
since
their
meeting
that
he
had
really
seen
her
face
and
he
was
struck
by
the
touch
of
awe
that
had
come
upon
her
beauty
perhaps
her
recent
suffering
had
spiritualised
a
countenance
already
pure
and
lofty
for
as
he
looked
at
her
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
transformed
into
a
being
beyond
earthly
contact
and
his
heart
sank
with
the
sense
of
her
remoteness
presently
she
began
to
speak
and
his
consciousness
of
the
distance
between
them
was
increased
by
the
composure
of
her
manner
all
signs
of
confusion
and
distress
had
vanished
she
faced
him
with
the
same
innocent
freedom
as
under
her
father
roof
and
all
that
had
since
passed
between
them
seemed
to
have
slipped
from
her
without
a
trace
she
began
by
thanking
him
for
coming
and
then
at
once
reverted
to
her
desperate
situation
and
to
her
determination
to
escape
i
am
alone
and
friendless
she
said
and
though
the
length
of
our
past
acquaintance
and
here
indeed
she
blushed
scarce
warrants
such
a
presumption
yet
i
believe
that
in
my
father
name
i
may
appeal
to
you
it
may
be
that
with
the
best
will
to
help
me
you
can
discover
no
way
of
doing
so
but
at
least
i
shall
have
the
benefit
of
your
advice
i
now
see
she
added
again
deeply
blushing
but
keeping
her
eyes
on
his
the
madness
of
my
late
attempt
and
the
depth
of
the
abyss
from
which
you
rescued
me
death
were
indeed
preferable
to
such
chances
but
i
do
not
mean
to
die
while
life
holds
out
a
hope
of
liberation
as
she
spoke
there
flashed
on
odo
the
reason
of
her
remoteness
and
composure
he
had
come
to
her
as
a
lover
she
received
him
as
a
friend
his
longing
to
aid
her
was
inspired
by
passion
she
saw
in
it
only
the
natural
impulse
of
benevolence
so
mortifying
was
the
discovery
that
he
hardly
followed
her
words
all
his
thoughts
were
engaged
in
reviewing
the
past
and
he
now
saw
that
if
as
she
said
their
acquaintance
scarce
warranted
her
appealing
to
him
as
a
friend
it
still
less
justified
his
addressing
her
as
a
lover
only
once
before
had
he
spoken
to
her
of
love
and
that
under
circumstances
which
almost
forbade
a
return
to
the
subject
or
at
least
compelled
an
added
prudence
in
approaching
it
once
again
he
found
himself
the
prisoner
of
his
folly
and
stood
aghast
at
the
ingenuity
of
the
punishment
to
play
the
part
she
ascribed
to
him
was
his
only
portion
and
he
resolved
at
least
to
play
it
like
a
man
with
what
composure
he
might
he
assured
fulvia
of
his
desire
to
serve
her
and
asked
if
she
had
no
hope
of
obtaining
her
release
from
the
holy
see
she
answered
none
since
enquiry
must
reveal
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
man
who
had
been
prosecuted
for
heresy
and
that
after
his
death
she
had
devoted
the
small
sum
he
had
left
her
to
the
publication
of
his
writings
she
added
that
his
holiness
resolved
to
counteract
the
effects
of
the
late
pope
leniency
had
greatly
enlarged
the
powers
of
the
inquisition
and
had
taken
special
measures
to
prevent
those
who
entered
the
religious
life
from
renouncing
their
calling
since
i
have
been
here
she
said
three
nuns
have
tried
to
obtain
their
release
and
one
has
conclusively
proved
that
she
was
forced
to
take
the
vows
by
fraud
but
their
pleas
have
been
rejected
and
mine
would
meet
the
same
fate
indeed
the
only
result
would
be
to
deprive
me
of
what
little
liberty
i
am
allowed
for
the
three
nuns
i
speak
of
are
now
the
most
closely
watched
in
the
convent
she
went
on
to
explain
that
thanks
to
the
connivance
of
sister
mary
of
the
crucifix
her
actual
escape
might
be
effected
without
much
difficulty
but
that
she
was
now
awake
to
the
madness
of
taking
so
desperate
a
step
without
knowing
whither
it
would
lead
her
to
be
safe
she
said
i
must
cross
the
borders
of
switzerland
if
i
could
reach
geneva
i
should
be
beyond
the
arm
of
the
holy
office
and
at
the
university
there
i
should
find
friends
of
my
father
who
would
surely
take
pity
on
my
situation
and
help
me
to
a
living
but
the
journey
is
long
and
difficult
and
not
to
be
safely
attempted
without
some
assurance
of
shelter
on
the
way
it
was
on
odo
lips
to
declare
that
he
would
provide
her
with
shelter
and
escort
but
at
this
moment
three
warning
taps
announced
the
return
of
sister
mary
of
the
crucifix
she
entered
merrily
and
at
once
laid
one
hand
on
fulvia
brow
and
caught
her
wrist
in
the
other
the
patient
pulse
has
risen
she
declared
and
rest
and
a
lowering
treatment
are
essential
i
must
ask
the
cavaliere
to
withdraw
fulvia
with
an
air
of
constraint
held
out
her
hand
to
odo
i
shall
see
you
soon
again
he
whispered
and
sister
mary
as
though
she
had
guessed
his
words
cried
out
i
think
your
excellency
may
count
on
a
recurrence
of
the
seizure
two
days
hence
at
the
same
hour
with
this
odo
was
forced
to
be
content
and
he
passed
the
intervening
time
in
devising
the
means
of
fulvia
rescue
he
was
resolved
to
let
no
rashness
or
negligence
hinder
the
attempt
and
to
prove
by
the
discretion
of
his
course
that
he
was
no
longer
the
light
fool
who
had
once
hazarded
her
safety
he
went
about
his
preparations
as
one
that
had
no
private
stake
in
the
venture
but
he
was
therefore
the
more
punctilious
to
show
himself
worthy
of
her
trust
and
sensible
of
the
charge
it
laid
upon
him
at
their
next
meeting
he
found
her
in
the
same
open
and
friendly
mood
and
she
listened
gratefully
as
he
set
forth
his
plan
this
was
that
she
should
first
write
to
a
doctor
of
the
university
in
geneva
who
had
been
her
father
friend
stating
her
plight
and
asking
if
he
could
help
her
to
a
living
should
she
contrive
to
reach
geneva
pending
the
reply
odo
was
to
plan
the
stages
of
the
journey
in
such
fashion
that
she
might
count
on
concealment
in
case
of
pursuit
and
she
was
not
to
attempt
her
escape
till
these
details
were
decided
fulvia
was
the
more
ready
to
acquiesce
in
this
postponement
as
she
did
not
wish
to
involve
sister
mary
in
her
adventure
but
hoped
to
escape
unassisted
during
an
entertainment
which
was
to
take
place
in
the
convent
on
the
feast
of
saint
michael
some
six
weeks
later
to
odo
the
delay
was
still
more
welcome
for
it
gave
him
what
he
must
needs
regard
as
his
last
opportunity
of
being
in
the
girl
company
she
had
accepted
his
companionship
on
the
journey
with
a
readiness
in
which
he
saw
only
the
magnanimity
of
pardon
but
in
geneva
they
must
part
and
what
hope
had
he
of
seeing
her
again
the
first
smart
of
vanity
allayed
he
was
glad
she
chose
to
treat
him
as
a
friend
it
was
in
this
character
that
he
could
best
prove
his
disinterestedness
his
resolve
to
make
amends
for
the
past
and
in
this
character
only
as
he
now
felt
would
it
be
possible
for
him
to
part
from
her
on
his
second
visit
he
ventured
to
discharge
his
mind
of
its
heaviest
burden
by
enquiring
what
had
befallen
her
and
her
father
after
he
had
lost
trace
of
them
at
vercelli
she
told
him
quite
simply
that
failing
to
meet
him
at
the
appointed
place
they
at
once
guessed
that
his
plan
had
been
winded
by
the
abate
who
travelled
with
him
and
that
after
a
few
hours
delay
her
father
had
succeeded
in
securing
a
chaise
which
had
taken
them
safely
across
the
border
she
went
on
to
speak
of
the
hardships
they
had
suffered
after
reaching
milan
even
under
a
comparatively
liberal
government
it
was
small
advantage
to
be
marked
by
the
holy
office
and
though
he
received
much
kindness
and
even
material
aid
from
those
of
his
way
of
thinking
vivaldi
was
unable
to
obtain
the
professorship
he
had
hoped
for
from
milan
they
went
to
pavia
but
in
this
university
the
most
liberal
in
italy
the
chairs
were
so
sought
after
that
there
was
no
hope
of
his
receiving
a
charge
worthy
of
his
talents
here
however
his
spirit
breathed
its
natural
air
and
reluctant
to
lose
the
privileges
of
such
intercourse
he
decided
to
accept
the
post
of
librarian
to
an
eccentric
nobleman
of
the
town
if
his
pay
was
modest
his
duties
left
him
leisure
for
the
work
which
was
his
chief
concern
for
his
patron
who
had
houses
in
milan
and
brescia
came
seldom
to
pavia
and
fulvia
and
her
father
had
the
vast
palace
to
themselves
they
lodged
in
a
corner
adjoining
the
library
spending
their
days
in
studious
seclusion
their
evenings
in
conversation
with
some
of
the
first
scholars
of
europe
the
learned
botanist
scopoli
spallanzani
volta
and
father
fontana
the
famous
mathematician
in
such
surroundings
vivaldi
might
have
pursued
his
task
contentedly
enough
but
for
the
thought
of
fulvia
future
this
his
daughter
said
continually
preyed
on
him
driving
him
to
labours
beyond
his
strength
for
he
hoped
by
the
publication
of
his
book
to
make
good
at
least
in
part
the
loss
of
the
small
property
which
the
sardinian
government
had
confiscated
all
her
entreaties
could
not
dissuade
him
from
and
in
addition
to
his
regular
duties
he
took
on
himself
as
she
afterward
learned
the
tedious
work
of
revising
proofs
and
copying
manuscripts
for
the
professors
this
drudgery
combined
with
severe
intellectual
effort
exceeded
his
flagging
powers
and
the
book
was
hardly
completed
when
his
patron
apprised
of
its
contents
abruptly
removed
him
from
his
post
from
that
day
vivaldi
sank
in
health
but
he
ended
as
became
a
sage
content
to
have
discharged
the
task
for
which
he
had
given
up
home
and
substance
and
dying
with
the
great
stoic
words
upon
his
lips
lex
non
poena
mors
vivaldi
friends
in
milan
came
generously
to
fulvia
aid
and
she
would
gladly
have
remained
among
them
but
after
the
loss
of
her
small
inheritance
and
of
her
father
manuscript
she
was
without
means
of
repaying
their
kindness
and
nothing
remained
but
to
turn
to
her
own
kin
as
odo
sat
in
the
quiet
cell
listening
to
her
story
and
hearing
again
the
great
names
his
youth
had
reverenced
he
felt
himself
an
exile
returning
to
his
own
mounting
the
familiar
heights
and
breathing
the
air
that
was
his
birthright
looking
back
from
this
recovered
standpoint
he
saw
how
far
behind
his
early
hopes
had
been
left
since
his
departure
from
naples
there
had
been
nothing
to
remind
him
of
that
vast
noiseless
labour
of
the
spirit
going
on
everywhere
beneath
the
social
surface
that
baffled
but
undiscouraged
endeavour
in
which
he
had
once
so
impatiently
claimed
his
share
now
every
word
of
fulvia
smote
the
bones
of
some
dead
purpose
till
his
bosom
seemed
a
very
valley
of
ezekiel
her
own
trials
had
fanned
her
love
of
freedom
and
the
near
hope
of
release
lent
an
exaltation
to
her
words
of
bitterness
of
resentment
she
gave
no
sign
and
he
was
awed
by
the
same
serenity
of
spirit
which
had
struck
him
in
the
imprisoned
doctor
but
perhaps
the
strongest
impression
she
produced
was
that
of
increasing
his
points
of
contact
with
life
his
other
sentimental
ties
had
been
a
barrier
between
himself
and
the
outer
world
but
the
feeling
which
drew
him
to
fulvia
had
the
effect
of
levelling
the
bounds
of
egoism
of
letting
into
the
circle
of
his
nearest
emotions
that
great
tide
of
human
longing
and
effort
that
had
always
faintly
sounded
on
the
shores
of
self
perhaps
it
was
her
power
of
evoking
this
wider
life
that
gave
a
sense
of
permanence
of
security
almost
to
the
stolen
moments
of
their
intercourse
lulling
the
lover
impatience
of
actual
conditions
with
the
sense
of
something
that
must
survive
the
accidents
of
fortune
only
in
some
such
way
could
he
explain
in
looking
back
the
completeness
of
each
moment
spent
with
her
he
was
conscious
even
at
the
time
of
a
suspension
of
the
emotional
laws
a
charmed
surrender
to
the
limitations
of
his
fate
when
he
was
away
his
impatience
reasserted
itself
but
her
presence
was
like
a
soothing
hand
on
his
spirit
and
he
knew
that
his
quiet
hours
with
her
would
count
among
those
intervals
between
the
crises
of
life
that
flower
in
memory
when
the
crises
themselves
have
faded
it
was
natural
that
in
the
course
of
these
visits
she
in
turn
should
question
him
and
as
his
past
rearranged
itself
beneath
her
scrutiny
he
seemed
once
more
to
trace
the
thread
of
purpose
on
which
its
fragments
hung
he
told
her
of
his
connection
with
the
liberals
of
pianura
of
the
situation
at
court
and
of
the
reason
for
his
prolonged
travels
as
he
talked
her
eyes
conveyed
the
exquisite
sense
of
her
complete
comprehension
she
saw
before
he
could
justify
himself
how
the
uncertainty
of
his
future
and
his
inability
to
act
had
cast
him
adrift
upon
a
life
of
superficial
enjoyment
and
how
his
latent
dissatisfaction
with
this
life
had
inevitably
resulted
in
and
vacillation
you
wait
your
hour
she
said
of
him
and
he
seized
on
the
phrase
as
a
justification
of
his
inactivity
and
when
chance
should
offer
a
spur
to
fresh
endeavour
her
interest
in
the
liberal
cause
had
been
intensified
and
exalted
by
her
father
death
his
martyrdom
as
she
described
it
like
most
women
possessed
of
an
abstract
idea
she
had
unconsciously
personified
the
idea
and
made
a
religion
of
it
but
it
was
a
religion
of
charity
and
not
of
vindictiveness
i
should
like
my
father
death
avenged
by
love
and
not
by
hate
she
said
i
would
have
it
bring
peace
not
a
sword
on
one
point
only
she
remained
if
not
hostile
yet
unresponsive
this
was
when
he
spoke
of
de
crucis
her
manner
hardened
instantly
and
he
perceived
that
though
he
dwelt
on
the
jesuit
tolerant
view
and
cultivated
tastes
she
beheld
only
the
priest
and
not
the
man
she
had
been
eager
to
hear
of
crescenti
whom
she
knew
by
name
as
a
student
of
european
repute
and
to
the
praise
of
whose
parochial
charities
she
listened
with
outspoken
sympathy
but
the
jesuits
stood
for
the
holy
office
and
she
had
suffered
too
deeply
at
the
hands
of
the
holy
office
to
regard
with
an
open
mind
any
who
might
be
supposed
to
represent
its
principles
it
was
impossible
for
odo
to
make
her
understand
how
distinctly
in
de
crucis
case
the
man
predominated
over
the
order
and
conscious
of
the
painfulness
of
the
subject
he
gave
up
the
attempt
to
interest
her
in
his
friend
three
or
four
times
he
was
permitted
to
visit
her
in
her
cell
after
that
they
met
almost
daily
in
the
parlour
where
about
the
hour
of
benediction
they
could
talk
almost
as
privately
under
cover
of
the
general
chatter
in
due
time
fulvia
received
an
answer
from
the
calvinist
professor
who
assured
her
of
a
welcome
in
geneva
and
shelter
under
his
roof
odo
meanwhile
had
perfected
the
plan
of
their
journey
but
as
michaelmas
approached
he
began
to
fear
cantapresto
observation
he
now
bitterly
regretted
that
he
had
not
held
to
his
purpose
of
sending
the
soprano
back
to
pianura
but
to
do
so
at
this
point
would
be
to
challenge
observation
and
he
resolved
instead
on
despatching
him
to
monte
alloro
with
a
letter
to
the
old
duke
as
the
way
to
geneva
lay
in
the
opposite
direction
this
would
at
least
give
the
fugitives
a
three
days
lead
and
they
had
little
cause
to
fear
pursuit
from
any
other
quarter
the
convent
indeed
might
raise
a
hue
and
cry
but
the
nuns
of
santa
chiara
had
lately
given
the
devout
so
much
cause
for
scandal
that
the
abbess
would
probably
be
disposed
to
hush
up
any
fresh
delinquency
the
time
too
was
for
the
sisters
had
prevailed
on
the
reverend
mother
to
celebrate
the
saint
day
by
a
masked
ball
and
the
whole
convent
was
engrossed
in
the
invention
of
whimsical
disguises
the
nuns
indeed
were
not
to
take
part
in
the
ball
but
a
number
of
them
were
to
appear
in
an
allegorical
entertainment
with
which
the
evening
was
to
open
the
new
papal
nuncio
who
was
lately
arrived
in
venice
had
promised
to
be
present
and
as
he
was
known
to
be
a
man
of
pleasure
there
was
scarce
a
sister
in
the
convent
but
had
an
eye
to
his
conquest
these
circumstances
gave
to
fulvia
plans
the
shelter
of
indifference
for
in
the
delightful
effort
of
surpassing
the
other
nuns
even
mary
of
the
crucifix
lost
interest
in
her
friend
affairs
odo
to
preserve
the
secrecy
of
his
designs
had
been
obliged
to
keep
up
a
pretence
of
his
former
habits
showing
himself
abroad
with
and
castelrovinato
and
frequenting
the
procuratessa
routs
and
this
lady
though
lately
returned
to
the
brenta
had
announced
her
intention
of
coming
to
venice
for
the
ball
at
santa
chiara
and
was
mightily
preoccupied
with
the
entertainment
at
which
he
purposed
his
mistress
should
outshine
all
her
companions
the
evening
came
at
last
and
odo
found
himself
entering
the
gates
of
santa
chiara
with
a
throng
of
the
convent
was
noted
for
its
splendid
hospitality
and
unwonted
preparations
had
been
made
to
honour
the
saint
the
bridge
leading
to
the
square
of
santa
chiara
was
decked
with
a
colonnade
of
pasteboard
and
stiffened
linen
cunningly
painted
and
a
classical
portico
masked
the
entrance
gate
a
flourish
of
trumpets
and
hautboys
and
the
firing
of
miniature
cannon
greeted
the
arrival
of
the
guests
who
were
escorted
to
the
parlour
which
was
hung
with
tapestries
and
glowing
with
lights
like
a
lady
chapel
here
they
were
received
by
the
abbess
who
on
the
arrival
of
the
nuncio
led
the
way
to
the
garden
where
a
stage
had
been
erected
the
nuns
who
were
not
to
take
part
in
the
play
had
been
seated
directly
under
the
stage
divided
from
the
rest
of
the
company
by
a
low
screen
of
foliage
ranged
beneath
the
footlights
which
shone
on
their
bare
shoulders
and
white
gowns
and
on
the
gauze
veils
replacing
their
monastic
coifs
they
seemed
a
choir
of
pagan
virgins
grouped
in
the
proscenium
of
an
antique
theatre
everything
indeed
combined
to
produce
the
impression
of
some
classic
festival
the
setting
of
motionless
foliage
the
mild
autumnal
sky
in
which
the
stars
hung
near
and
vivid
and
the
foreground
thronged
with
a
motley
company
lit
by
the
shifting
brightness
of
torches
as
odo
in
mask
and
travesty
stood
observing
the
audience
the
pasteboard
theatre
adorned
with
statuary
and
the
nuns
flitting
across
the
stage
his
imagination
strung
to
the
highest
pitch
by
his
own
impending
venture
was
thrilled
by
the
contrast
between
the
outward
appearance
of
the
scene
and
its
underlying
reality
from
where
he
stood
he
looked
directly
at
the
abbess
who
was
seated
with
the
nuncio
and
his
suite
under
the
tall
crucifix
in
the
centre
of
the
garden
as
if
to
emphasise
the
irony
of
the
situation
the
torch
fixed
behind
this
noble
group
cast
an
enlarged
shadow
of
the
cross
over
the
abbess
white
gown
and
the
splendid
robes
of
her
companions
who
though
they
wore
the
mask
had
not
laid
aside
their
clerical
dress
to
odo
the
juxtaposition
had
the
effect
of
some
supernatural
warning
the
shadow
of
the
divine
wrath
projected
on
its
heedless
ministers
an
impression
heightened
by
the
fact
that
just
opposite
the
cross
a
lively
figure
of
pan
surmounting
the
pediment
of
the
theatre
seemed
to
fling
defiance
at
the
galilean
intruder
the
nuns
like
the
rest
of
the
company
were
masked
and
it
had
been
agreed
between
odo
and
fulvia
that
the
latter
should
wear
a
wreath
of
myrtle
above
her
veil
as
almost
all
her
companions
had
chosen
flowers
this
dark
green
chaplet
was
easily
distinguished
among
the
clustered
heads
beneath
the
stage
and
odo
had
no
doubt
of
being
able
to
rejoin
fulvia
in
the
moment
of
dispersal
that
should
follow
the
conclusion
of
the
play
he
knew
that
the
sisters
were
to
precede
their
guests
and
be
locked
behind
the
grate
before
the
ball
began
but
as
they
passed
through
the
garden
and
cloisters
the
barrier
between
nuns
and
visitors
would
probably
not
be
too
strictly
maintained
as
he
had
foreseen
the
company
attracted
by
the
graceful
procession
pressed
forward
regardless
of
the
assistant
mistresses
protests
and
the
shadowy
arcades
were
full
of
laughter
and
whispered
snatches
of
talk
as
the
white
flock
was
driven
back
to
its
fold
odo
had
withdrawn
to
the
darkest
angle
of
the
cloister
close
to
a
door
leading
to
the
pharmacy
it
was
here
that
fulvia
had
told
him
to
wait
and
though
he
had
lost
sight
of
her
when
the
audience
rose
he
stood
confidently
watching
for
the
reappearance
of
the
presently
he
saw
it
close
at
hand
and
just
then
the
line
of
sisters
flowed
toward
him
driven
forward
by
a
group
of
lively
masqueraders
among
whom
he
seemed
to
recognise
voice
and
figure
nothing
could
have
been
more
opportune
for
the
pressure
swept
the
wearer
of
the
almost
into
his
arms
and
as
the
intruders
were
dispersed
and
the
nuns
laughingly
reformed
their
lines
her
hand
lingered
in
his
and
he
felt
himself
drawn
toward
the
door
it
yielded
to
her
touch
and
odo
followed
her
down
a
dark
passageway
to
the
empty
room
where
rows
of
old
faenza
jars
and
flagons
glimmered
in
the
dusk
beyond
the
pharmacy
was
another
door
the
key
of
which
hung
on
the
wall
with
the
portress
hood
and
cloak
without
a
word
the
girl
wrapped
herself
in
the
cloak
and
fitting
the
key
to
the
lock
softly
opened
the
door
all
this
was
done
with
a
rapidity
and
assurance
for
which
odo
was
unprepared
but
reflecting
that
whole
future
hung
on
the
promptness
with
which
each
detail
of
her
plan
was
executed
he
concluded
that
her
natural
force
of
character
enabled
her
to
assume
an
ease
she
could
hardly
feel
the
door
opened
on
the
and
brushing
the
with
her
flying
skirts
she
sped
on
ahead
of
odo
to
the
postern
which
the
nuns
were
accustomed
to
use
for
their
nocturnal
escapades
only
the
thickness
of
an
oaken
gate
stood
between
fulvia
and
the
outer
world
to
her
the
opening
of
the
gate
meant
the
first
step
toward
freedom
but
to
odo
the
passing
from
their
enchanted
weeks
of
fellowship
to
the
inner
loneliness
of
his
former
life
he
hung
back
silent
while
she
drew
the
bolt
a
moment
later
they
had
crossed
the
threshold
and
his
gondola
was
slipping
toward
them
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
wall
fulvia
sprang
on
board
and
he
followed
her
under
the
felze
the
warm
darkness
enclosing
them
stirred
impulses
which
their
daily
intercourse
had
subdued
and
in
the
sense
of
her
nearness
he
lost
sight
of
the
conditions
which
had
brought
them
together
the
feeling
seemed
to
communicate
itself
for
as
the
gondola
rounded
the
angle
of
the
and
swung
out
on
the
open
she
drooped
toward
him
with
the
turn
of
the
boat
and
their
lips
met
under
the
loosened
masks
at
the
same
instant
the
light
of
the
virgin
shrine
in
the
corner
of
the
fell
through
the
window
of
the
felze
on
the
face
lifted
to
odo
and
he
found
himself
suddenly
confronted
by
the
tender
eyes
and
malicious
smile
of
sister
mary
of
the
crucifix
by
diana
she
cried
as
he
started
back
i
did
but
claim
my
pay
in
advance
nor
do
i
think
that
when
she
knows
all
sister
veronica
will
grudge
me
my
reward
he
continued
to
stare
at
her
in
speechless
bewilderment
and
she
went
on
with
a
kind
of
tender
impatience
you
simpleton
can
you
not
guess
that
you
were
watched
and
that
but
for
me
your
veronica
would
at
this
moment
be
lying
under
lock
and
key
in
her
cell
instead
of
which
she
continued
speaking
more
slowly
and
leaning
back
as
though
to
enjoy
the
full
savour
of
his
suspense
instead
of
which
she
now
awaits
you
in
a
safe
nook
of
my
choosing
where
within
half
an
hour
time
you
may
atone
to
her
with
interest
for
the
infidelity
into
which
i
have
betrayed
you
she
knows
then
odo
faltered
not
daring
to
say
more
in
his
ignorance
of
sister
mary
share
in
the
secret
sister
mary
shook
her
head
with
a
tantalising
laugh
that
you
are
coming
alas
no
poor
angel
she
fancies
that
she
has
been
sent
from
the
convent
to
avoid
you
as
indeed
she
was
and
by
the
reverend
mother
own
order
who
it
seems
had
wind
of
the
intrigue
this
morning
but
the
saints
be
praised
the
excellent
sister
who
was
ordered
to
attend
her
is
in
my
pay
and
instead
of
conducting
her
to
her
relatives
of
san
barnado
who
were
to
keep
her
locked
up
over
night
has
if
i
mistake
not
taken
her
to
a
good
woman
of
my
acquaintance
an
old
servant
in
fact
who
will
guard
her
as
jealously
as
the
family
plate
till
you
and
i
come
to
her
release
as
she
spoke
she
put
out
her
head
and
gave
a
whispered
order
to
the
gondolier
and
at
the
word
the
boat
swung
round
and
headed
for
the
city
in
the
violent
reaction
which
this
strange
encounter
produced
odo
was
for
the
moment
incapable
of
taking
any
clear
note
of
his
surroundings
uncertain
if
he
were
not
once
more
the
victim
of
some
such
mischance
as
seemed
to
attend
all
his
efforts
to
succour
fulvia
he
sat
in
silent
apprehension
as
the
gondola
shot
across
the
grand
canal
and
entered
the
labyrinth
of
behind
san
moise
sister
mary
took
his
silence
philosophically
you
dare
not
speak
to
me
for
fear
of
betraying
yourself
she
said
and
i
scarce
wonder
at
your
distrust
for
your
plans
were
so
well
laid
that
i
had
no
notion
of
what
was
on
foot
and
must
have
remained
in
ignorance
if
veronica
had
not
been
put
in
sister
martha
charge
but
you
will
both
live
to
thank
me
and
i
hope
she
added
laughing
to
own
that
you
would
have
done
better
to
take
me
into
your
confidence
from
the
first
as
she
spoke
the
gondola
touched
at
the
head
of
a
narrow
passage
which
lost
itself
in
the
blackness
of
the
overhanging
houses
sister
mary
sprang
out
and
drew
odo
after
her
a
few
yards
down
the
alley
she
entered
a
plain
house
somewhat
withdrawn
behind
its
neighbours
followed
by
odo
she
groped
her
way
up
a
dark
flight
of
stairs
and
knocked
at
a
door
on
the
upper
landing
a
vague
flutter
within
indicative
of
whispers
and
uncertain
movements
was
followed
by
the
slipping
of
the
bolt
and
a
woman
looked
out
she
drew
back
with
an
exclamation
of
welcome
and
sister
mary
seizing
odo
by
the
shoulders
pushed
him
across
the
threshold
of
a
small
kitchen
fulvia
in
her
nun
habit
cowered
in
the
darkest
corner
but
at
sight
of
odo
she
sprang
up
and
ran
toward
him
with
a
happy
cry
an
hour
later
the
two
were
well
on
their
way
toward
mestre
where
a
awaited
them
odo
having
learned
that
andreoni
was
settled
in
padua
had
asked
him
to
receive
fulvia
in
his
house
till
the
next
and
the
bookseller
whom
he
had
taken
into
his
confidence
was
eager
to
welcome
the
daughter
of
the
revered
vivaldi
the
extremes
of
hope
and
apprehension
had
left
fulvia
too
exhausted
for
many
words
and
odo
after
she
had
confirmed
every
particular
of
sister
mary
story
refrained
from
questioning
her
farther
thanks
to
her
friend
resources
she
had
been
able
to
exchange
her
nun
dress
for
the
plain
gown
and
of
a
young
woman
of
the
middle
class
and
this
dress
painfully
recalled
to
odo
the
day
when
he
had
found
her
standing
beside
the
chaise
on
the
road
to
vercelli
the
recollection
was
not
calculated
to
put
him
at
his
ease
and
indeed
it
was
only
now
that
he
began
to
feel
the
peculiar
constraint
of
his
position
to
andreoni
his
explanation
of
fulvia
flight
had
seemed
natural
enough
but
on
the
subsequent
stages
of
their
journey
she
must
pass
for
his
mistress
or
his
wife
and
he
hardly
knew
in
what
spirit
she
would
take
the
misapprehensions
that
must
inevitably
arise
at
mestre
their
carriage
waited
and
they
drove
rapidly
toward
padua
through
the
waning
night
andreoni
in
his
concern
for
fulvia
safety
had
prepared
for
her
reception
a
little
of
his
wife
in
a
vineyard
beyond
the
town
and
here
at
daybreak
it
was
almost
a
relief
to
odo
to
commit
his
charge
to
the
signora
andreoni
care
the
day
was
spent
indoors
and
andreoni
having
thought
it
more
prudent
to
bring
no
servant
from
padua
his
wife
prepared
the
meals
for
their
guests
and
the
bookseller
drew
a
jar
of
his
own
wine
from
the
cellar
fulvia
kept
to
herself
during
the
day
but
at
dusk
she
surprised
odo
by
entering
the
room
with
a
trayful
of
plates
and
glasses
and
helping
their
hostess
to
set
out
the
the
few
hours
of
rest
had
restored
to
her
not
only
the
serenity
of
the
convent
but
a
lightness
of
step
and
glance
that
odo
had
not
seen
in
her
since
the
early
days
of
their
friendship
he
marvelled
to
see
how
the
first
breath
of
freedom
had
set
her
blood
in
motion
and
fanned
her
languid
eye
but
he
could
not
suppress
the
accompanying
thought
that
his
own
presence
had
failed
to
work
such
miracles
they
had
planned
to
ride
that
night
to
a
little
village
in
the
hills
beyond
vicenza
where
fulvia
a
peasant
of
the
vicentine
lived
with
her
son
who
was
a
and
supper
was
hardly
over
when
they
were
told
that
their
horses
waited
their
kind
hosts
dared
not
urge
them
to
linger
and
after
a
hurried
farewell
they
rode
forth
into
the
fresh
darkness
of
the
september
night
the
new
moon
was
down
and
they
had
to
thread
their
way
slowly
through
the
stony
lanes
between
the
vineyards
at
length
they
gained
the
open
country
and
growing
more
accustomed
to
the
darkness
put
their
horses
to
a
trot
the
change
of
pace
and
the
exhilaration
of
traversing
an
unknown
country
in
the
hush
and
mystery
of
night
combined
to
free
their
spirits
and
odo
began
to
be
aware
that
the
barrier
between
them
was
lifted
to
the
charm
of
their
intercourse
at
santa
chiara
was
added
that
closer
sympathy
produced
by
the
sense
of
isolation
they
were
enclosed
in
their
common
risk
as
in
some
secret
where
no
consciousness
of
the
outer
world
intruded
and
though
their
talk
kept
the
safe
level
of
their
immediate
concerns
he
felt
the
change
in
every
inflection
of
fulvia
voice
and
in
the
subtler
emphasis
of
her
silences
the
way
was
long
and
he
had
feared
that
she
would
be
taxed
beyond
her
strength
but
the
miles
seemed
to
fly
beneath
their
horses
feet
and
they
could
scarcely
believe
that
the
dark
hills
which
rose
ahead
of
them
against
a
whitening
sky
marked
the
limit
of
their
journey
with
some
difficulty
they
found
their
way
to
the
house
a
mere
hut
in
a
remote
fold
of
the
hills
from
motives
of
prudence
they
had
not
warned
the
nurse
of
their
coming
but
they
found
the
old
woman
already
at
work
in
her
and
learned
from
her
that
her
son
had
gone
down
to
his
day
labour
in
the
valley
she
received
fulvia
with
a
tender
wonder
as
at
some
supernatural
presence
descending
into
her
life
too
much
awed
till
the
first
embraces
were
over
to
risk
any
conjecture
as
to
odo
presence
but
with
the
returning
sense
of
familiarity
the
fancied
recovery
of
the
nurseling
features
in
the
girl
definite
outline
came
the
inevitable
reaction
of
curiosity
and
the
fugitives
felt
themselves
coupled
in
the
old
woman
meaning
smiles
to
odo
surprise
fulvia
received
these
innuendoes
with
baffling
composure
parrying
the
questions
she
seemed
to
answer
and
finally
taking
refuge
in
a
plea
for
rest
but
the
accord
of
the
previous
night
was
broken
and
when
the
travellers
set
out
again
starting
a
little
before
sunset
to
avoid
the
return
the
constraint
of
the
day
began
to
weigh
upon
them
in
fulvia
case
physical
weariness
perhaps
had
a
share
in
the
change
but
whatever
the
cause
its
effect
was
to
make
this
stage
of
the
journey
strangely
tedious
to
both
their
way
lay
through
the
country
north
of
vicenza
whence
they
hoped
by
dawn
to
gain
peschiera
on
the
lake
of
garda
and
hire
a
chaise
which
should
take
them
across
the
border
for
the
first
hour
or
two
they
had
the
new
moon
to
light
them
but
as
it
set
the
sky
clouded
and
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
fulvia
had
hitherto
shown
a
gay
indifference
to
the
discomforts
of
the
journey
but
she
presently
began
to
complain
of
the
cold
and
to
question
odo
anxiously
as
to
the
length
of
the
way
the
hilliness
of
the
country
forced
them
to
travel
slowly
and
it
seemed
to
odo
that
hours
had
elapsed
before
they
saw
lights
in
the
valley
below
them
their
plan
had
been
to
avoid
the
towns
on
their
way
and
fulvia
the
night
before
had
contented
herself
with
a
rest
by
the
roadside
but
a
heavy
rain
was
now
falling
and
she
at
once
assented
to
odo
tentative
proposal
that
they
should
take
shelter
till
the
storm
was
over
they
dismounted
at
an
inn
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
the
sleepy
landlord
stared
as
he
unbarred
the
door
and
led
them
into
the
kitchen
but
he
offered
no
comment
beyond
remarking
that
it
was
a
good
night
to
be
under
cover
fulvia
sank
down
on
the
wooden
settle
near
the
chimney
where
a
fire
had
been
hastily
kindled
she
took
no
notice
of
odo
when
he
removed
the
dripping
cloak
from
her
shoulders
but
sat
gazing
before
her
in
a
kind
of
apathy
i
can
not
eat
she
said
as
odo
pressed
her
to
take
her
place
at
the
table
the
innkeeper
turned
to
him
with
a
confidential
nod
your
lady
looks
fairly
beaten
he
said
i
a
notion
that
one
of
my
good
beds
would
be
more
to
her
taste
than
the
best
supper
in
the
land
shall
i
have
a
room
made
ready
for
your
excellencies
no
no
said
fulvia
starting
up
we
must
set
out
again
as
soon
as
we
have
supped
she
approached
the
table
and
hastily
emptied
the
glass
of
country
wine
that
odo
had
poured
out
for
her
the
innkeeper
seemed
a
simple
unsuspicious
fellow
but
at
this
he
put
down
the
plate
of
cheese
he
was
carrying
and
looked
at
her
curiously
start
out
again
at
this
hour
of
the
night
he
exclaimed
by
the
saints
your
excellencies
must
be
running
a
race
with
the
sun
or
do
you
doubt
my
being
able
to
provide
you
with
decent
lodgings
that
you
prefer
mud
and
rain
to
my
good
sheets
and
pillows
indeed
no
odo
amicably
interposed
but
we
are
hurrying
to
meet
a
friend
who
is
to
rejoin
us
tomorrow
at
peschiera
ah
at
peschiera
said
the
other
as
though
the
name
had
struck
him
he
took
a
dish
of
eggs
from
the
fire
and
set
it
before
fulvia
well
he
went
on
with
a
shrug
it
is
written
that
none
of
my
beds
shall
be
slept
in
tonight
not
two
hours
since
i
had
a
gentleman
here
that
gave
the
very
same
excuse
for
hurrying
forward
though
his
horses
were
so
spent
that
i
had
to
provide
him
with
another
pair
before
he
could
continue
his
journey
he
laughed
and
uncorked
a
second
bottle
that
reminds
me
he
went
on
pausing
suddenly
before
fulvia
that
the
other
gentleman
was
travelling
to
meet
a
friend
too
a
lady
he
said
a
young
lady
he
fancied
she
might
have
passed
this
way
and
questioned
me
closely
but
as
it
happened
there
had
been
no
petticoat
under
my
roof
for
three
i
wonder
now
if
he
could
have
been
looking
for
your
excellencies
fulvia
flushed
high
at
this
but
a
sign
from
odo
checked
the
denial
on
her
lips
why
said
he
it
is
not
unlikely
though
i
had
fancied
our
friend
would
come
from
another
direction
what
was
this
gentleman
like
the
landlord
hesitated
evidently
not
so
much
from
any
reluctance
to
impart
what
he
knew
as
from
the
inability
to
express
it
well
said
he
trying
to
supplement
his
words
by
a
vaguely
descriptive
gesture
he
was
a
handsome
man
smallish
built
but
with
a
fine
manner
and
dressed
not
unlike
your
excellency
ah
said
odo
carelessly
our
friend
is
an
and
which
way
did
this
gentleman
travel
he
went
on
pouring
himself
another
glass
the
landlord
assumed
an
air
of
country
cunning
there
the
fishy
part
of
it
said
he
he
gave
orders
to
go
toward
verona
but
my
boy
who
chased
the
carriage
down
the
road
as
lads
will
says
that
at
the
below
the
old
mill
the
driver
took
the
turn
for
peschiera
fulvia
at
this
seemed
no
longer
able
to
control
herself
she
came
close
to
odo
and
said
in
a
low
urgent
tone
for
heaven
sake
let
us
set
forward
odo
again
signed
to
her
to
keep
silent
and
with
an
effort
she
resumed
her
seat
and
made
a
pretence
of
eating
a
moment
later
he
despatched
the
landlord
to
the
stable
to
see
that
the
horses
had
been
rubbed
down
and
as
soon
as
the
door
closed
she
broke
out
passionately
it
is
my
fault
she
cried
it
is
all
my
fault
for
coming
here
if
i
had
had
the
courage
to
keep
on
this
would
never
have
happened
no
said
odo
quietly
and
we
should
have
gone
straight
to
peschiera
and
landed
in
the
arms
of
our
pursuer
if
this
mysterious
traveller
is
in
pursuit
of
us
his
tone
seemed
to
steady
her
oh
she
said
and
the
colour
flickered
out
of
her
face
as
it
happens
he
went
on
nothing
could
have
been
more
fortunate
than
our
coming
here
i
see
i
see
but
now
we
must
go
on
at
once
she
persisted
he
looked
at
her
gravely
this
is
your
wish
she
seemed
seized
with
a
panic
fear
i
can
not
stay
here
she
repeated
which
way
shall
we
go
then
if
we
continue
to
peschiera
and
this
man
is
after
us
we
are
lost
but
if
he
does
not
find
us
he
may
return
here
he
will
surely
return
here
he
can
not
return
before
morning
it
is
close
on
midnight
already
meanwhile
you
can
take
a
few
hours
rest
while
i
devise
means
of
reaching
the
lake
by
some
across
the
mountain
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
take
this
tone
with
her
but
he
saw
that
in
her
mood
any
other
would
have
been
less
effective
she
rose
slowly
keeping
her
eyes
on
him
with
the
look
of
a
frightened
child
i
will
do
as
you
wish
she
said
let
the
landlord
prepare
a
bed
for
you
then
i
will
keep
watch
down
here
and
the
horses
shall
be
saddled
at
daylight
she
stood
silent
while
he
went
to
the
door
to
call
the
innkeeper
but
when
the
order
was
given
and
the
door
closed
again
she
disconcerted
him
by
a
sudden
sob
what
a
burden
i
am
she
cried
i
had
no
right
to
accept
this
of
you
and
she
turned
and
fled
up
the
dark
stairs
the
night
passed
and
toward
dawn
the
rain
ceased
odo
rose
from
his
dreary
vigil
in
the
kitchen
and
called
to
the
innkeeper
to
carry
up
bread
and
wine
to
fulvia
room
then
he
went
out
to
see
that
the
horses
were
fed
and
watered
he
had
not
dared
to
question
the
landlord
as
to
the
roads
lest
his
doing
so
should
excite
suspicion
but
he
hoped
to
find
an
ostler
who
would
give
him
the
information
he
needed
the
stable
was
empty
however
and
he
prepared
to
bait
the
horses
himself
as
he
stooped
to
place
his
lantern
on
the
floor
he
caught
the
gleam
of
a
small
polished
object
at
his
feet
he
picked
it
up
and
found
that
it
was
a
silver
such
as
are
attached
to
the
blinders
and
saddles
of
a
his
curiosity
was
aroused
and
holding
the
light
closer
he
recognised
the
ducal
crown
of
pianura
surmounting
the
humilitas
of
the
valseccas
the
discovery
was
so
startling
that
for
some
moments
he
stood
gazing
at
the
small
object
in
his
hand
without
being
able
to
steady
his
confused
ideas
gradually
they
took
shape
and
he
saw
that
if
the
ornament
had
fallen
from
the
harness
of
the
traveller
who
had
just
preceded
them
it
was
not
fulvia
but
he
himself
who
was
being
pursued
but
who
was
it
who
sought
him
and
to
what
purpose
one
fact
alone
was
clear
the
traveller
whoever
he
was
rode
in
one
of
the
duke
carriages
and
therefore
presumably
upon
his
sovereign
business
odo
was
still
trying
to
thread
a
way
through
these
conjectures
when
a
yawning
ostler
pushed
open
the
your
excellency
is
in
a
hurry
to
be
gone
he
said
with
a
surprised
glance
odo
handed
him
the
can
you
tell
me
what
this
is
he
asked
carelessly
i
picked
it
up
here
a
moment
ago
the
other
turned
it
over
and
stared
why
said
he
that
off
the
harness
of
the
gentleman
that
supped
here
last
night
the
same
that
went
on
later
to
peschiera
odo
proceeded
to
question
him
about
the
over
monte
baldo
and
having
bidden
him
saddle
the
horses
in
half
an
hour
crossed
the
courtyard
and
the
inn
a
grey
light
was
already
falling
through
the
windows
and
he
mounted
the
stairs
and
knocked
on
the
door
which
he
thought
must
be
fulvia
her
voice
bade
him
enter
and
he
found
her
seated
fully
dressed
beside
the
window
she
rose
with
a
smile
and
he
saw
that
she
had
regained
her
usual
do
we
set
out
at
once
she
asked
there
is
no
great
haste
he
answered
you
must
eat
first
and
by
that
time
the
horses
will
be
saddled
as
you
please
she
returned
with
a
readiness
in
which
he
divined
the
wish
to
make
amends
for
her
wilfulness
the
previous
night
her
eyes
and
cheeks
glowed
with
an
excitement
which
counterfeited
the
effects
of
a
night
rest
and
he
thought
he
had
never
seen
her
more
radiant
she
approached
the
table
on
which
the
wine
and
bread
had
been
placed
and
drew
another
chair
beside
her
own
will
you
not
share
with
me
she
asked
filling
a
glass
for
him
he
took
it
from
her
with
a
smile
i
have
good
news
for
you
he
said
holding
out
the
bit
of
silver
which
he
had
brought
from
the
stable
she
examined
it
wonderingly
what
does
this
mean
she
asked
looking
up
at
him
that
it
is
i
who
am
being
followed
and
not
you
she
started
and
the
ornament
slipped
from
her
hand
you
she
faltered
with
a
quick
change
of
colour
this
he
explained
dropped
from
the
harness
of
the
traveller
who
left
the
inn
just
before
our
arrival
last
night
well
she
said
still
without
understanding
and
do
you
know
the
coat
odo
smiled
it
is
mine
he
answered
and
the
crown
is
my
cousin
the
traveller
must
have
been
a
messenger
of
the
duke
she
stood
leaning
against
the
seat
from
which
she
had
risen
one
hand
still
grasping
it
while
the
other
hung
inert
her
lips
parted
but
she
did
not
speak
her
pallor
troubled
odo
and
he
went
up
to
her
and
took
her
hand
do
you
not
understand
he
said
gently
that
there
is
no
farther
cause
for
alarm
i
have
no
reason
to
think
that
the
duke
messenger
is
in
pursuit
of
me
but
should
he
be
so
and
should
he
overtake
us
he
has
no
authority
over
you
and
no
reason
for
betraying
you
to
your
enemies
the
blood
poured
back
to
her
face
me
my
enemies
she
stammered
it
is
not
of
them
i
think
she
raised
her
head
and
faced
him
in
a
glow
for
a
moment
he
stood
stupidly
gazing
at
her
then
the
mist
lifted
and
through
it
he
saw
a
great
light
the
landlord
knock
warned
them
that
their
horses
waited
and
they
rode
out
in
the
grey
morning
the
world
about
them
still
lay
in
shade
and
as
they
climbed
the
wooded
defile
above
the
valley
odo
was
reminded
of
the
days
at
donnaz
when
he
had
ridden
up
the
mountain
in
the
same
early
light
never
since
then
had
he
felt
as
he
did
now
the
boy
easy
kinship
with
the
unexpected
the
sense
that
no
encounter
could
be
too
wonderful
to
fit
in
with
the
mere
wonder
of
living
to
avoid
the
road
to
peschiera
they
had
resolved
to
cross
the
monte
baldo
by
a
which
should
bring
them
out
at
one
of
the
villages
on
the
eastern
shore
of
garda
and
the
search
for
this
path
led
them
up
through
steep
woods
where
they
had
to
part
the
wet
boughs
as
they
passed
from
time
to
time
they
regained
the
highway
and
rode
abreast
almost
silent
at
first
with
the
weight
of
their
new
nearness
and
then
breaking
into
talk
that
was
the
mere
overflow
of
what
they
were
thinking
there
was
in
truth
more
to
be
felt
between
them
than
to
be
said
since
as
each
was
aware
the
new
light
that
suffused
the
present
left
the
future
as
obscure
as
before
but
what
mattered
when
the
hour
was
theirs
the
narrow
kingdom
of
today
is
better
worth
ruling
over
than
the
widest
past
or
future
but
not
more
than
once
does
a
man
hold
its
fugitive
sceptre
the
past
however
was
theirs
also
a
past
so
transformed
that
he
must
revisit
it
with
her
joyously
confronting
her
new
self
with
the
image
of
her
that
met
them
at
each
turn
then
he
had
himself
to
trace
in
her
memories
his
transfigured
likeness
to
linger
over
in
the
of
her
faith
in
him
this
interchange
of
recollections
served
them
as
well
as
any
outspoken
expression
of
feeling
and
the
most
commonplace
allusion
was
charged
with
happy
meanings
arabia
petraea
had
been
an
eden
to
such
travellers
how
much
more
the
happy
slopes
they
were
now
descending
all
the
afternoon
their
path
wound
down
the
western
incline
of
monte
baldo
first
under
huge
olives
then
through
thickets
of
laurel
and
acacia
to
emerge
on
a
lower
level
of
lemon
and
orange
groves
with
the
blue
lake
showing
through
a
diaper
of
boughs
fulvia
to
whom
this
southern
foliage
was
as
new
as
the
pure
intensity
of
light
that
bathed
it
seemed
to
herself
to
be
moving
through
the
landscape
of
a
dream
it
was
as
though
nature
had
been
remodelled
transformed
almost
under
the
touch
of
their
love
as
though
they
had
found
their
way
to
the
hesperian
glades
in
which
poets
and
painters
placed
the
legendary
lovers
of
antiquity
such
feelings
were
intensified
by
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
in
italy
the
young
girls
of
the
middle
class
though
seemingly
allowed
a
greater
freedom
of
intercourse
than
the
daughters
of
noblemen
were
in
reality
as
strictly
guarded
though
like
fulvia
they
might
converse
with
the
elderly
merchants
or
scholars
frequenting
the
family
table
they
were
never
alone
in
the
company
of
men
and
the
high
standard
of
conduct
prevailing
in
the
bourgeoisie
forbade
all
thought
of
clandestine
intercourse
this
was
especially
true
of
the
families
of
men
of
letters
where
the
liberal
education
of
the
young
girls
and
their
habit
of
associating
as
equals
with
men
of
serious
and
cultivated
minds
gave
them
a
disconcerting
to
the
young
blood
accustomed
to
conquer
with
a
glance
these
girls
as
a
rule
were
married
early
to
men
of
their
own
standing
and
though
the
cicisbeo
was
not
unknown
after
marriage
he
was
not
an
authorised
member
of
the
household
fulvia
indeed
belonged
to
the
class
most
inaccessible
to
men
of
odo
rank
the
only
class
in
italy
in
which
the
wife
fidelity
was
as
much
esteemed
as
the
innocence
of
the
girl
such
principles
had
long
been
ridiculed
by
persons
of
quality
and
satirised
by
poets
and
playwrights
from
aristophanes
to
beaumarchais
the
cheated
husband
and
the
outwitted
guardian
had
been
the
figures
on
which
the
dramatist
relied
for
his
comic
effects
even
the
miser
tricked
out
of
his
savings
was
a
shade
less
ridiculous
less
grotesquely
deserving
of
his
fate
than
the
husband
defrauded
of
his
wife
affection
the
plausible
adulteress
and
the
adroit
seducer
had
a
recognised
claim
on
the
sympathy
of
the
public
but
the
inevitable
reaction
was
at
hand
and
the
new
teachers
to
whom
odo
contemporaries
were
beginning
to
listen
had
thrown
a
strangely
poetic
light
over
the
dull
figures
of
the
domestic
virtues
faithfulness
to
the
family
sanctities
reverence
for
the
marriage
tie
courage
to
sacrifice
the
loftiest
passion
to
the
most
plodding
duty
these
were
qualities
to
touch
the
fancy
of
a
generation
sated
with
derision
if
love
as
a
sentiment
was
the
discovery
of
the
medieval
poets
love
as
a
moral
emotion
might
be
called
that
of
the
philosophers
who
for
all
their
celebration
of
free
unions
and
fatal
passions
were
really
on
the
side
of
the
angels
were
fighting
the
battle
of
the
spiritual
against
the
sensual
of
conscience
against
appetite
the
imperceptible
action
of
these
new
influences
formed
the
real
barrier
between
odo
and
fulvia
the
girl
stood
for
the
embodiment
of
the
purifying
emotions
that
were
to
renew
the
world
her
candour
her
unapproachableness
her
simple
trust
in
him
were
a
part
of
the
magic
light
which
the
new
idealism
had
shed
over
the
old
social
structure
his
was
in
short
a
love
large
enough
to
include
other
emotions
a
widening
rather
than
a
contraction
of
the
emotional
range
youth
and
propinquity
have
before
now
broken
down
stronger
defences
but
fulvia
situation
was
an
unspoken
appeal
to
her
lover
forbearance
the
sense
that
her
safety
depended
on
him
kept
his
sentimental
impulses
in
check
and
made
the
happiness
of
the
moment
seem
in
its
exquisite
unreality
a
mere
dreamlike
interlude
between
the
facts
of
life
toward
sunset
they
rested
in
an
tethering
their
horses
to
the
low
boughs
overhead
through
the
thin
foliage
of
tarnished
silver
the
sky
as
the
moon
suffused
it
melted
from
steel
blue
to
a
clearer
silver
a
whose
hut
stood
close
by
brought
them
a
cheese
on
a
and
a
jug
of
and
as
they
supped
a
little
driving
his
flock
down
the
hill
paused
to
watch
them
with
furtive
woodland
eyes
odo
questioning
him
learned
that
at
the
village
on
the
shore
below
they
could
obtain
a
boat
to
carry
them
across
the
lake
fulvia
for
lack
of
a
passport
dared
not
set
foot
on
austrian
soil
but
the
swiss
authorities
were
less
exacting
and
odo
had
hopes
of
crossing
the
border
without
difficulty
they
set
out
again
presently
descending
through
the
grey
dusk
of
the
olives
till
the
path
became
too
steep
for
riding
then
odo
lifted
fulvia
from
the
saddle
and
led
the
two
horses
after
her
here
and
there
between
the
trees
they
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
of
lights
on
the
shore
and
the
pale
gleam
of
the
lake
enclosed
in
black
foliage
from
the
village
below
came
snatches
of
song
and
the
shrill
wail
of
a
pipe
and
as
the
night
deepened
they
saw
far
out
on
the
water
the
wild
flare
of
the
torches
like
comets
in
an
inverted
sky
with
nightfall
the
spirits
of
both
had
sunk
fulvia
walked
ahead
in
silence
and
odo
read
a
mute
apprehension
in
her
drooping
outline
every
step
brought
them
nearer
to
the
point
they
both
feared
to
face
and
though
each
knew
what
lay
in
the
other
thoughts
neither
dared
break
the
silence
odo
mind
turned
anxiously
to
the
incidents
of
the
morning
to
the
finding
of
the
ducal
and
to
all
the
possibilities
it
suggested
what
errand
save
one
could
have
carried
an
envoy
from
pianura
to
that
remote
hamlet
among
the
hills
he
could
scarcely
doubt
that
it
was
in
pursuit
of
himself
that
the
ducal
messenger
travelled
but
with
what
object
was
the
journey
undertaken
was
he
to
be
recalled
in
obedience
to
some
new
whim
of
the
duke
or
had
some
unforeseen
change
he
dared
not
let
his
thoughts
define
it
suddenly
made
his
presence
needful
in
pianura
it
was
more
probable
that
the
possibility
of
his
flight
with
fulvia
had
been
suggested
to
the
duke
by
the
ecclesiastical
authorities
and
that
the
same
hand
which
had
parted
them
before
was
again
secretly
at
work
in
any
case
it
was
first
business
to
see
his
companion
safely
across
the
border
and
in
that
endeavour
he
had
now
little
fear
of
being
thwarted
if
the
messenger
awaited
them
at
peschiera
he
waited
in
vain
and
though
their
flight
across
the
lake
might
be
known
before
dawn
it
would
then
be
no
easy
matter
to
overtake
them
in
an
hour
time
as
odo
had
hoped
they
were
putting
off
from
the
shore
in
a
which
was
the
lightest
craft
the
village
could
provide
the
lake
was
stark
calm
and
the
two
boatmen
silhouetted
against
the
moonlight
drove
the
boat
forward
with
even
vigorous
strokes
fulvia
shivering
in
the
autumnal
chill
had
drawn
her
hood
close
about
her
and
sat
silent
her
face
in
shade
measured
by
their
secret
apprehensions
the
boat
progress
seemed
at
first
indescribably
slow
but
gradually
the
sounds
from
the
shore
grew
fainter
and
the
fugitives
felt
themselves
alone
in
a
world
enclosed
by
the
moonlit
circle
of
the
waters
as
they
advanced
this
sense
of
isolation
and
security
grew
deeper
and
more
impressive
the
motionless
surface
of
the
lake
was
enclosed
in
a
wall
of
mountains
which
the
moonlight
seemed
to
vein
with
marble
a
sky
in
which
the
stars
were
dissolved
in
white
radiance
curved
high
above
their
heads
and
not
a
sail
flecked
the
lake
or
a
cloud
the
sky
the
boat
seemed
suspended
alone
in
some
ethereal
medium
presently
one
of
the
boatmen
spoke
to
the
other
and
glanced
toward
the
north
then
the
second
silently
shipped
his
oar
and
hoisted
the
sail
hardly
had
he
made
it
fast
when
a
fresh
of
wind
came
down
the
lake
and
they
began
to
stretch
across
the
bay
with
spreading
canvas
the
wind
was
contrary
but
odo
welcomed
it
for
he
saw
at
once
that
it
would
be
quicker
work
to
tack
to
the
other
shore
than
to
depend
on
the
oars
the
scene
underwent
a
sudden
change
the
silver
mirror
over
which
they
had
appeared
to
glide
was
shivered
into
sparkling
fragments
and
in
the
enveloping
rush
and
murmur
of
the
night
the
boat
woke
to
a
creaking
straining
activity
the
man
at
the
rudder
suddenly
pointed
to
a
huddle
of
lights
to
the
south
peschiera
odo
laughed
we
shall
soon
show
it
our
heels
said
he
the
other
boatman
shrugged
his
shoulders
even
an
enemy
roof
may
serve
to
keep
out
the
storm
he
observed
philosophically
the
storm
what
storm
the
man
pointed
to
the
north
against
the
sky
hung
a
little
black
cloud
the
merest
flaw
in
the
perfect
curve
of
the
night
the
lake
is
shrewish
at
this
season
the
boatman
continued
did
your
excellencies
burn
a
candle
before
starting
odo
sat
silent
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
cloud
it
was
growing
visibly
now
with
every
moment
its
outline
seemed
to
shift
and
spread
till
its
black
menace
dilated
to
the
zenith
the
bright
water
still
broke
about
them
in
diamond
spray
but
as
the
shadow
travelled
the
lake
beneath
it
turned
to
lead
then
the
storm
dropped
on
them
it
fell
suddenly
out
of
sky
and
water
grew
black
and
a
long
shudder
ran
through
the
boat
for
a
moment
she
hung
back
staggering
under
a
white
fury
of
blows
then
the
gale
seemed
to
lift
and
swing
her
about
and
she
shot
forward
through
a
long
tunnel
of
glistening
blackness
bows
on
for
peschiera
the
enemy
roof
thought
odo
he
reached
for
fulvia
hand
and
found
it
in
the
darkness
the
rain
was
driving
against
them
now
and
he
drew
her
close
and
wrapped
his
cloak
about
her
she
lay
still
without
a
tremor
as
though
in
that
shelter
no
fears
could
reach
her
the
night
roared
about
them
and
the
waters
seemed
to
divide
beneath
their
keel
through
the
tumult
odo
shouted
to
the
boatmen
to
try
to
make
some
harbour
north
of
peschiera
they
shouted
back
that
they
must
go
where
the
wind
willed
and
bless
the
saints
if
they
made
any
harbour
at
all
and
odo
saw
that
peschiera
was
their
destiny
it
was
past
midnight
when
they
set
foot
on
shore
the
rain
still
fell
in
torrents
and
they
could
hardly
grope
their
way
up
the
steps
of
the
odo
first
concern
was
to
avoid
the
inn
but
the
boatmen
exhausted
by
their
efforts
and
impatient
to
be
under
shelter
could
not
be
bribed
to
seek
out
at
that
hour
another
lodging
for
the
travellers
odo
dared
not
expose
fulvia
longer
to
the
storm
and
reluctantly
they
turned
toward
the
inn
trusting
that
at
that
hour
their
coming
would
attract
little
notice
a
stood
in
the
courtyard
and
somewhat
to
surprise
the
landlord
was
still
afoot
he
led
them
into
the
public
parlour
which
was
alight
with
a
good
fire
on
the
hearth
a
gentleman
in
sat
near
this
fire
his
back
to
the
door
reading
by
a
shaded
candle
he
rose
as
the
travellers
entered
and
odo
recognised
the
abate
de
crucis
the
latter
advanced
with
a
smile
in
which
pleasure
was
more
visible
than
surprise
he
bowed
slightly
to
fulvia
who
had
shrunk
back
into
the
shadow
of
the
doorway
then
he
turned
to
odo
and
said
cavaliere
i
have
travelled
six
days
to
overtake
you
the
duke
of
pianura
is
dying
and
has
named
you
regent
odo
heard
a
slight
movement
behind
him
he
turned
and
saw
that
fulvia
had
vanished
he
understood
her
wish
for
concealment
but
its
futility
was
written
in
the
glance
with
which
de
crucis
followed
her
flight
the
abate
continued
to
speak
in
urgent
tones
i
implore
you
he
said
to
lose
no
time
in
accompanying
me
to
pianura
the
situation
there
is
critical
and
before
now
his
highness
death
may
have
placed
the
reins
in
your
hands
he
glanced
at
his
watch
if
your
excellency
is
not
too
tired
to
set
out
at
once
my
horses
can
be
harnessed
within
the
half
hour
odo
heart
sank
to
have
let
his
thoughts
dwell
on
such
a
possibility
seemed
to
have
done
little
to
prepare
him
for
its
realisation
he
hardly
understood
what
de
crucis
was
saying
he
knew
only
that
an
hour
before
he
had
fancied
himself
master
of
his
fate
and
that
now
he
was
again
in
bonds
his
first
clear
thought
was
that
nothing
should
part
him
from
fulvia
de
crucis
seemed
to
read
the
thought
cavaliere
he
said
at
a
moment
when
time
is
so
valuable
you
will
pardon
my
directness
you
are
accompanying
to
switzerland
a
lady
who
has
placed
herself
in
your
charge
odo
made
no
reply
and
the
other
went
on
in
the
same
firm
but
courteous
tone
foreseeing
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
you
to
leave
her
so
abruptly
i
provided
myself
in
venice
with
a
passport
which
will
take
her
safely
across
the
border
he
drew
a
paper
from
his
coat
this
said
he
handing
it
to
odo
is
the
papal
nuncio
authorisation
to
the
signorina
fulvia
vivaldi
known
in
religion
as
sister
veronica
to
absent
herself
from
italy
for
an
indefinite
period
with
this
passport
and
a
good
escort
your
companion
will
have
no
difficulty
in
joining
her
friends
excess
of
astonishment
kept
odo
silent
for
a
moment
and
in
that
moment
he
had
as
it
were
a
fugitive
glimpse
into
the
workings
of
the
great
power
which
still
strove
for
predominance
in
italy
a
from
the
papal
nuncio
to
fulvia
vivaldi
was
equivalent
to
her
release
from
her
vows
and
this
in
turn
implied
that
for
the
moment
religious
discipline
had
been
frankly
sacrificed
to
the
pressure
of
political
necessities
how
the
invisible
hands
made
and
unmade
the
destinies
of
those
who
came
in
their
way
how
boldly
the
church
swept
aside
her
own
defences
when
they
obstructed
her
course
he
was
conscious
even
at
the
moment
of
all
that
men
like
de
crucis
had
to
say
in
defence
of
this
higher
expediency
this
avowed
discrimination
between
the
factors
in
each
fresh
combination
of
circumstances
he
had
himself
felt
the
complex
wonder
of
thoughtful
minds
before
the
church
perpetual
miracle
of
change
disguised
in
immutability
but
now
he
saw
only
the
meaner
side
of
the
game
its
elements
of
cruelty
and
falseness
and
he
felt
himself
no
more
than
a
frail
bark
on
the
dark
and
tossing
seas
of
ecclesiastical
intrigue
for
a
moment
his
heart
shuddered
back
from
its
fate
no
passport
no
he
said
at
length
can
release
me
from
my
duty
to
the
lady
who
has
placed
herself
in
my
care
i
shall
not
leave
her
till
she
has
joined
her
friends
de
crucis
bowed
this
is
the
answer
i
expected
he
said
not
without
sadness
odo
glanced
at
him
in
surprise
the
two
men
hitherto
had
addressed
each
other
as
strangers
but
now
something
in
the
abate
tone
recalled
to
odo
the
familiarity
of
their
former
intercourse
their
deep
community
of
thought
the
significance
of
the
days
they
had
spent
together
in
the
monastery
of
monte
cassino
the
association
of
ideas
brought
before
him
the
profound
sense
of
responsibility
with
which
at
that
time
he
had
looked
forward
to
such
an
hour
as
this
the
abate
was
watching
him
gravely
cavaliere
he
said
every
instant
counts
all
you
had
once
hoped
to
do
for
pianura
is
now
yours
to
accomplish
but
in
your
absence
your
enemies
are
not
idle
his
highness
may
revoke
your
appointment
at
any
hour
of
late
i
have
had
his
ear
but
i
have
now
been
near
a
week
absent
and
you
know
the
duke
is
not
long
constant
to
one
cavaliere
he
exclaimed
i
appeal
to
you
not
in
the
name
of
the
god
whom
you
have
come
to
doubt
but
in
that
of
your
whom
you
have
wished
to
serve
odo
looked
at
him
not
without
a
confused
sense
of
the
irony
of
such
an
appeal
on
such
lips
yet
with
the
distinct
consciousness
that
it
was
uttered
in
all
sincerity
and
that
whatever
their
superficial
diversity
of
view
he
and
de
crucis
were
at
one
on
those
deeper
questions
that
gave
the
moment
its
real
significance
it
is
impossible
he
repeated
that
i
should
go
with
you
de
crucis
was
again
silent
and
odo
was
aware
of
the
renewed
intentness
of
his
scrutiny
if
the
lady
broke
from
him
once
but
he
checked
himself
and
took
a
turn
in
the
room
meanwhile
a
resolve
was
slowly
forming
itself
in
odo
he
would
not
be
false
to
the
call
which
since
his
boyhood
had
so
often
made
itself
heard
before
the
voice
of
pleasure
and
but
he
would
at
least
reserve
the
right
to
obey
it
in
his
own
fashion
and
under
conditions
which
left
his
private
inclination
free
there
may
be
more
than
one
way
of
serving
one
fellows
he
said
quietly
go
back
without
me
abate
tell
my
cousin
that
i
resign
my
rights
to
the
succession
i
shall
live
my
own
life
elsewhere
not
unworthily
i
hope
but
as
a
private
person
de
crucis
had
turned
pale
for
a
moment
his
habitual
seemed
about
to
fail
him
and
odo
could
not
but
see
that
a
sincere
personal
regret
was
mingled
with
the
political
agent
consciousness
of
failure
he
himself
was
chiefly
aware
of
a
sense
of
relief
of
as
though
he
had
at
last
solved
a
baffling
enigma
and
found
himself
once
more
at
one
with
his
fate
suddenly
he
heard
a
step
behind
him
fulvia
had
the
room
she
had
put
off
her
drenched
cloak
but
the
hair
lay
in
damp
strands
on
her
forehead
deepening
her
pallor
and
the
lines
of
weariness
under
her
eyes
she
moved
across
the
room
carrying
her
head
high
and
advancing
tranquilly
to
odo
side
even
in
that
moment
of
confused
emotions
he
was
struck
by
the
nobility
of
her
gait
and
gesture
she
turned
to
de
crucis
and
odo
had
the
immediate
intuition
that
she
had
recognised
him
will
you
let
me
speak
a
word
privately
to
the
cavaliere
valsecca
she
said
the
other
bowed
silently
and
turned
away
the
door
closed
on
him
and
odo
and
fulvia
remained
alone
for
a
moment
neither
spoke
then
she
said
that
was
the
abate
de
crucis
he
assented
she
looked
at
him
sadly
you
still
believe
him
to
be
your
friend
yes
he
answered
frankly
i
still
believe
him
to
be
my
friend
and
spite
of
his
cloth
the
friend
of
justice
and
humanity
but
he
is
here
simply
as
the
duke
agent
he
has
been
for
some
time
the
governor
of
prince
ferrante
i
knew
she
murmured
i
knew
he
went
up
to
her
and
caught
her
hands
why
do
we
waste
our
time
upon
him
he
exclaimed
impatiently
nothing
matters
but
that
i
am
free
at
last
she
drew
back
gently
releasing
herself
free
my
choice
is
made
i
have
resigned
my
right
to
the
succession
i
shall
not
return
to
pianura
she
continued
to
stare
at
him
leaning
against
the
chair
from
which
de
crucis
had
risen
your
choice
is
made
your
choice
is
made
she
repeated
and
you
have
chosen
you
he
said
simply
will
you
go
to
france
with
me
fulvia
will
you
be
my
wife
and
work
with
me
at
a
distance
for
the
cause
that
in
italy
we
may
not
serve
together
i
have
never
abandoned
the
aims
your
father
taught
me
to
strive
for
they
are
dearer
more
sacred
to
me
than
ever
but
i
can
not
strive
for
them
alone
i
must
feel
your
hand
in
mine
i
must
know
that
your
heart
beats
with
mine
i
must
hear
the
voice
of
liberty
speak
to
me
in
your
voice
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
went
up
to
her
all
this
is
nothing
he
said
i
love
you
i
can
not
give
you
up
that
is
all
for
a
moment
as
he
spoke
her
face
shone
with
an
extraordinary
light
she
looked
at
him
intently
as
one
who
seemed
to
gaze
beyond
and
through
him
at
some
mystic
vision
that
his
words
evoked
then
the
brightness
faded
the
picture
you
draw
is
a
beautiful
one
she
said
speaking
slowly
in
sweet
deliberate
tones
but
it
is
not
for
me
to
look
on
what
you
said
last
is
not
true
if
you
love
me
it
is
because
we
have
thought
the
same
thoughts
dreamed
the
same
dream
heard
the
same
voice
in
each
voices
perhaps
as
you
say
but
none
the
less
a
real
voice
apart
from
us
and
above
us
and
one
which
would
speak
to
us
as
loudly
if
we
were
apart
one
which
both
of
us
must
follow
to
the
end
he
gazed
at
her
eagerly
as
she
spoke
and
while
he
gazed
there
came
to
him
perversely
enough
a
vision
of
the
life
he
was
renouncing
not
as
it
concerned
the
public
welfare
but
in
its
merely
personal
aspect
a
vision
of
the
power
the
luxury
the
sumptuous
background
of
traditional
state
and
prerogative
in
which
his
artistic
and
intellectual
tastes
as
well
as
his
easy
impulses
of
benevolence
would
find
unchecked
and
immediate
gratification
it
was
the
first
time
that
he
had
been
aware
of
such
lurking
influences
under
his
most
generous
aspirations
but
even
as
fulvia
ceased
to
speak
the
vision
faded
leaving
only
an
intenser
longing
to
bend
her
will
to
his
you
are
right
he
rejoined
we
must
follow
that
voice
to
the
end
but
why
not
together
your
father
himself
often
questioned
whether
the
patriot
could
not
serve
his
people
better
at
a
distance
than
in
their
midst
in
france
where
the
new
ideas
are
not
only
tolerated
but
put
in
practice
we
shall
be
able
to
study
their
effects
and
to
learn
how
they
may
best
be
applied
to
the
relief
of
our
own
unhappy
people
and
as
a
private
person
independent
of
party
and
patronage
could
i
not
do
more
than
as
the
nominal
head
of
a
narrow
government
where
every
act
and
word
would
be
used
by
my
enemies
to
injure
me
and
the
cause
i
represent
the
vigour
and
rapidity
of
the
attack
and
the
promptness
with
which
he
converted
her
argument
to
his
own
use
were
not
without
visible
effect
odo
saw
his
words
reflected
in
the
wavering
glow
of
fulvia
cheek
but
almost
at
once
she
regained
control
of
her
pulses
and
faced
him
with
that
serenity
which
seemed
to
come
to
her
at
such
moments
what
you
say
might
be
true
she
answered
were
your
opportunities
indeed
restricted
to
the
regency
but
the
little
prince
life
is
known
to
hang
on
a
thread
at
any
moment
you
may
be
duke
and
you
will
not
deny
that
as
duke
of
pianura
you
can
serve
your
people
better
than
as
an
obscure
pamphleteer
in
paris
odo
made
an
impatient
gesture
are
you
so
sure
he
said
even
as
duke
i
must
be
the
puppet
of
powers
greater
than
myself
of
austria
of
rome
nay
of
the
wealthy
nobles
who
will
always
league
themselves
with
their
sovereign
enemies
rather
than
suffer
a
hand
upon
their
privileges
and
even
if
i
were
fortunate
enough
to
outwit
my
masters
and
rule
indeed
over
what
a
toy
kingdom
should
i
reign
how
small
a
number
would
be
benefited
how
little
the
cause
would
be
helped
by
my
example
as
an
obscure
pamphleteer
i
might
reach
the
hearts
of
thousands
and
speak
to
great
kings
on
their
thrones
as
duke
of
pianura
fighting
to
reform
the
laws
of
my
little
state
i
should
rank
at
best
with
the
other
petty
sovereigns
who
are
amusing
themselves
all
over
italy
with
agricultural
experiments
and
improved
methods
of
again
the
brightness
shone
in
fulvia
face
how
you
love
me
she
said
as
he
paused
and
went
on
restraining
him
with
a
gesture
of
the
gentlest
dignity
for
it
is
love
that
speaks
thus
in
you
and
not
reason
and
you
know
as
i
do
that
the
duty
to
which
a
man
is
born
comes
before
any
of
his
own
choosing
you
are
called
to
serve
liberty
on
a
throne
i
in
some
obscure
corner
of
the
private
life
we
can
no
more
exchange
our
duties
than
our
stations
but
if
our
lives
divide
our
purpose
remains
one
and
as
pious
persons
recall
each
other
in
the
mystery
of
the
sacrament
so
we
shall
meet
in
spirit
in
the
new
religion
we
profess
her
voice
gained
strength
and
measure
as
she
spoke
and
odo
felt
that
all
that
passion
could
urge
must
spend
itself
in
vain
against
such
high
security
of
spirit
go
cavaliere
she
continued
i
implore
you
to
lose
no
time
in
reaching
pianura
occasion
is
and
an
hour
lingering
may
cost
you
the
regency
and
with
it
the
chance
of
gaining
a
hold
on
your
people
i
will
not
expatiate
as
some
might
on
the
power
and
dignities
that
await
you
you
are
no
adventurer
plotting
to
steal
a
throne
but
a
soldier
pledged
to
his
post
she
moved
close
to
him
and
suddenly
caught
his
hand
and
raised
it
to
her
lips
your
excellency
said
she
has
deigned
to
look
for
a
moment
on
a
poor
girl
that
crossed
your
path
now
your
eyes
must
be
on
your
people
who
will
yet
have
cause
to
love
and
bless
you
as
she
does
she
shone
on
him
with
a
weeping
brightness
that
dissolved
his
very
soul
ah
he
cried
you
have
indeed
learned
your
lesson
well
i
admire
with
what
stoic
calmness
you
pronounce
my
doom
with
what
readiness
you
dispose
of
my
future
it
is
not
mine
to
dispose
of
she
caught
him
up
nor
yours
but
belongs
as
much
as
any
slave
to
his
master
to
the
people
you
are
called
to
rule
think
for
how
many
generations
their
unheeded
sufferings
their
unrewarded
toil
have
paid
for
the
pomp
and
pleasure
of
your
house
that
is
the
debt
you
are
called
on
to
acquit
the
wrong
you
are
pledged
to
set
right
odo
was
silent
she
had
found
the
unanswerable
word
yes
he
was
called
on
to
acquit
the
accumulated
debt
of
that
long
unrighteous
rule
it
was
he
who
must
pay
if
need
be
with
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
for
the
savage
victories
of
bracciaforte
the
rapacity
of
guidobaldo
the
magnificence
of
ascanio
the
religious
terrors
and
secret
vices
of
the
poor
duke
now
nearing
his
end
all
these
passions
had
preyed
on
the
people
on
the
tillers
and
weavers
and
obscure
servants
of
a
wasteful
greatness
theirs
had
been
the
blood
that
renewed
the
exhausted
veins
of
their
rulers
through
generation
after
generation
of
dumb
labour
and
privation
and
the
noblest
passions
as
well
as
the
basest
had
been
nourished
at
the
same
cost
every
flower
in
the
ducal
gardens
every
picture
on
the
palace
walls
every
honour
in
the
ancient
annals
of
the
house
had
been
planted
paid
for
fought
for
by
the
people
with
mute
inconscient
irony
the
two
powers
had
faced
each
other
for
generations
the
subjects
never
guessing
that
their
sovereigns
were
puppets
of
their
own
making
the
dukes
that
all
their
pomp
and
circumstance
were
but
a
borrowed
motley
now
the
evil
wrought
in
ignorance
remained
to
be
undone
in
the
light
of
the
world
new
knowledge
the
discovery
of
that
universal
brotherhood
which
christ
had
long
ago
proclaimed
and
which
after
so
many
centuries
those
who
denied
christ
were
the
first
to
put
in
practice
hour
by
hour
day
by
day
at
the
cost
of
every
personal
inclination
of
all
that
endears
life
and
ennobles
failure
odo
must
set
himself
to
redeem
the
credit
of
his
house
he
saw
his
way
straight
before
him
but
in
that
hour
of
insight
his
heart
instinct
of
made
one
last
effort
against
fate
he
turned
to
fulvia
you
are
right
he
said
i
have
no
choice
you
have
shown
me
the
way
but
must
i
travel
it
alone
you
ask
me
to
give
up
at
a
stroke
all
that
makes
life
desirable
to
set
forth
without
a
backward
glance
on
the
very
road
that
leads
me
farthest
from
you
yesterday
i
might
have
obeyed
but
how
can
i
turn
today
from
this
near
view
of
my
happiness
he
paused
a
moment
and
she
seemed
about
to
answer
but
he
hurried
on
without
giving
her
time
fulvia
if
you
ask
this
sacrifice
of
me
is
there
none
you
will
make
in
return
if
you
bid
me
go
forth
and
work
for
my
people
will
you
not
come
with
me
and
work
for
them
too
he
stretched
out
his
hands
in
a
gesture
that
seemed
to
sum
up
his
infinite
need
of
her
and
for
a
moment
they
faced
each
other
silenced
by
the
nearness
of
great
issues
she
knew
well
enough
what
he
offered
according
to
the
code
of
the
day
there
was
no
dishonour
in
the
offer
and
it
did
not
occur
to
her
to
resent
it
but
she
looked
at
him
sadly
and
he
read
her
refusal
in
the
look
the
regent
mistress
she
said
slowly
the
key
to
the
treasury
the
to
preferment
the
secret
trafficker
in
titles
and
appointments
that
is
what
i
should
stand
for
and
it
is
not
to
such
services
that
you
must
even
appear
to
owe
your
power
i
will
not
say
that
i
have
my
own
work
to
do
for
the
dearest
service
i
could
perform
would
be
to
help
you
in
yours
but
to
do
this
i
must
stand
aside
to
be
near
you
i
must
go
from
you
to
love
you
i
must
give
you
up
she
looked
him
full
in
the
eyes
as
she
spoke
then
she
went
up
to
him
and
kissed
him
it
was
the
first
kiss
she
had
given
him
since
she
had
thrown
herself
in
his
arms
in
her
father
garden
but
now
he
felt
her
whole
being
on
her
lips
he
would
have
held
her
fast
forgetting
everything
in
the
sweetness
of
her
surrender
but
she
drew
back
quickly
and
before
he
could
guess
her
intention
throw
open
the
door
of
the
room
to
which
de
crucis
had
withdrawn
signor
abate
she
said
the
jesuit
came
forward
odo
was
dimly
aware
that
for
an
instant
the
two
measured
each
other
then
fulvia
said
quietly
his
excellency
goes
with
you
to
pianura
what
more
she
said
or
what
de
crucis
answered
he
could
never
afterward
recall
he
had
a
confused
sense
of
having
cried
out
a
last
unavailing
protest
faintly
inarticulately
like
a
man
struggling
to
make
himself
heard
in
a
dream
then
the
room
grew
dark
about
him
and
in
its
stead
he
saw
the
old
chapel
at
donnaz
with
its
shrine
and
heard
the
voice
of
the
chaplain
harsh
and
yet
strangely
shaken
my
chief
prayer
for
you
is
that
should
you
be
raised
to
this
eminence
it
may
be
at
a
moment
when
such
advancement
seems
to
thrust
you
in
the
dust
odo
lifted
his
head
and
saw
de
crucis
standing
alone
before
him
i
am
ready
he
said
book
iv
the
reward
where
are
the
portraits
of
those
who
have
perished
in
spite
of
their
vows
one
bright
march
day
in
the
year
the
bells
of
pianura
began
to
ring
at
sunrise
and
with
their
first
peal
the
townsfolk
were
abroad
the
city
was
already
dressed
for
a
festival
a
canopy
of
crimson
velvet
surmounted
by
the
ducal
crown
and
by
the
humilitas
of
the
valseccas
concealed
the
columns
of
the
cathedral
porch
and
fell
in
royal
folds
about
the
featureless
porphyry
lions
who
had
seen
so
many
successive
rulers
ascend
the
steps
between
their
outstretched
paws
the
frieze
of
ramping
and
running
animals
around
the
ancient
baptistery
was
concealed
by
heavy
green
garlands
alternating
with
religious
banners
and
every
church
and
chapel
had
draped
its
doorway
with
crimson
and
placed
above
the
image
of
its
patron
saint
the
ducal
crown
of
pianura
no
less
sumptuous
was
the
adornment
of
the
private
dwellings
the
great
families
the
trescorri
the
belverdi
the
pievepelaghi
had
outdone
each
other
in
the
display
of
tapestries
and
genoese
velvets
emblazoned
with
armorial
bearings
and
even
the
sombre
facade
of
the
boscofolto
palace
showed
a
rich
drapery
surmounted
by
the
quarterings
of
the
new
marchioness
but
it
was
not
only
the
that
had
put
on
a
holiday
dress
the
contagion
had
spread
to
the
poorer
quarters
and
in
many
a
narrow
street
and
crooked
lane
where
surely
no
part
of
the
coming
pageant
might
be
expected
to
pass
the
crazy
balconies
and
unglazed
windows
were
decked
out
with
scraps
of
finery
a
yard
or
two
of
velvet
filched
from
the
state
hangings
of
some
noble
house
a
torn
and
discoloured
church
banner
even
a
sacque
of
brocade
or
a
peasant
holiday
kerchief
skilfully
draped
about
the
rusty
iron
and
held
in
place
by
pots
of
and
sweet
basil
the
palace
which
had
once
housed
gamba
and
momola
showed
a
few
shreds
of
colour
on
its
sullen
front
and
the
abate
crescenti
modest
house
wedged
in
a
corner
of
the
city
walls
was
dressed
like
the
altar
of
a
lady
chapel
while
even
the
tanners
quarter
by
the
river
displayed
its
festoons
of
coloured
paper
and
tinsel
ingeniously
twisted
into
the
semblance
of
a
crown
for
the
new
duke
who
was
about
to
enter
his
capital
in
state
was
extraordinarily
popular
with
all
classes
his
popularity
as
yet
was
mainly
due
to
a
general
detestation
of
the
rule
he
had
replaced
but
such
a
sentiment
gives
to
a
new
sovereign
an
impetus
which
if
he
knows
how
to
use
it
will
carry
him
a
long
way
toward
success
and
among
those
in
the
duke
confidence
it
was
rumoured
that
he
was
qualified
not
only
to
profit
by
the
expectations
he
had
raised
but
to
fulfil
them
the
last
months
of
the
late
duke
life
had
plunged
the
duchy
into
such
political
and
financial
disorder
that
all
parties
were
agreed
in
welcoming
a
change
even
those
that
had
most
to
lose
by
the
accession
of
the
new
sovereign
or
most
to
fear
from
the
policy
he
was
known
to
favour
preferred
the
possibility
of
new
evils
to
a
continuance
of
present
conditions
the
expertest
angler
in
troubled
waters
may
find
waters
too
troubled
for
his
sport
and
under
a
government
where
power
is
passed
from
hand
to
hand
like
the
handkerchief
in
a
children
game
the
most
adroit
may
find
himself
grasping
the
empty
air
it
would
indeed
have
been
difficult
to
say
who
had
ruled
during
the
year
preceding
the
duke
death
prime
ministers
had
succeeded
each
other
like
the
clowns
in
a
harlequinade
just
as
the
church
seemed
to
have
gained
the
upper
hand
some
mysterious
revulsion
of
feeling
would
fling
the
duke
toward
trescorre
and
the
liberals
and
when
these
had
attempted
by
some
trifling
concession
to
popular
feeling
to
restore
the
credit
of
the
government
their
sovereign
seized
by
religious
scruples
would
hastily
recall
the
clerical
party
so
the
administration
staggered
on
reeling
from
one
policy
to
another
clutching
now
at
this
support
and
now
at
that
while
austria
and
the
holy
see
hung
on
its
steps
awaiting
the
inevitable
fall
a
cruel
winter
and
a
fresh
outbreak
of
the
silkworm
disease
had
aggravated
the
misery
of
the
people
while
the
mounting
extravagance
of
the
duchess
had
put
a
last
strain
on
the
exhausted
treasury
the
consequent
increase
of
the
roused
such
popular
fury
that
father
ignazio
who
was
responsible
for
the
measure
was
dismissed
by
the
duke
and
trescorre
as
usual
called
in
to
repair
his
rival
mistake
but
it
would
have
taken
a
greater
statesman
than
trescorre
to
reach
the
root
of
such
evils
and
the
new
minister
succeeded
neither
in
pacifying
the
people
nor
in
reassuring
his
sovereign
meanwhile
the
duke
was
sinking
under
the
mysterious
disease
which
had
hung
upon
him
since
his
birth
it
was
hinted
that
his
last
hours
were
darkened
by
hallucinations
and
the
pious
pictured
him
as
haunted
by
profligate
visions
while
the
maintained
that
he
was
the
dupe
of
priestly
jugglery
toward
the
end
there
was
the
inevitable
rumour
of
acqua
tofana
and
the
populace
cried
out
that
the
jesuits
were
at
work
again
it
seems
more
probable
however
that
his
highness
who
had
assisted
at
the
annual
festival
of
the
madonna
del
monte
and
had
mingled
on
foot
with
the
swarm
of
devotees
thronging
thither
from
all
parts
had
contracted
a
pestilent
disorder
from
one
of
the
pilgrims
certain
it
is
that
death
came
in
a
dreadful
form
the
duchess
alarmed
for
the
health
of
prince
ferrante
fled
with
him
to
the
by
the
piana
and
the
strange
nature
of
his
highness
distemper
caused
many
to
follow
her
example
even
the
duke
servants
and
the
quacks
that
lived
on
his
bounty
were
said
to
have
abandoned
the
and
an
english
traveller
passing
through
pianura
boasted
that
by
the
payment
of
a
small
fee
to
the
palace
porter
he
had
obtained
leave
to
enter
his
highness
closet
and
peer
through
the
doorway
at
the
dying
man
however
this
may
be
it
would
appear
that
the
duke
confessor
a
monk
of
the
barnabite
order
was
not
to
be
found
when
his
highness
called
for
him
and
the
servant
sent
forth
in
haste
to
fetch
a
priest
returned
strangely
enough
with
the
abate
crescenti
whose
suspected
orthodoxy
had
so
long
made
him
the
object
of
the
duke
detestation
he
it
was
who
alone
witnessed
the
end
of
that
tormented
life
and
knew
upon
what
hopes
or
fears
it
closed
meanwhile
it
appeared
that
the
duchess
precautions
were
not
unfounded
for
prince
ferrante
presently
sickened
of
the
same
malady
which
had
cut
off
his
father
and
when
the
regent
travelling
arrived
in
pianura
he
had
barely
time
to
pass
from
the
duke
obsequies
to
the
of
the
heir
etiquette
required
that
a
year
of
mourning
should
elapse
between
the
accession
of
the
new
sovereign
and
his
state
entry
into
his
capital
so
that
if
duke
odo
character
and
intentions
were
still
matter
of
conjecture
to
his
subjects
his
appearance
was
already
familiar
to
them
his
youth
his
good
looks
his
open
mien
his
known
affability
of
manner
were
so
many
arguments
in
his
favour
with
an
impressionable
and
impulsive
people
and
it
was
perhaps
natural
that
he
should
interpret
as
a
tribute
to
his
principles
the
sympathy
which
his
person
aroused
it
is
certain
that
he
fancied
himself
at
that
time
as
with
his
subjects
as
they
believed
themselves
to
be
with
him
and
the
understanding
supposed
to
exist
was
productive
of
equal
satisfaction
to
both
sides
the
new
duke
had
thrown
himself
with
extraordinary
zeal
into
the
task
of
loving
and
understanding
his
people
it
had
been
his
refuge
from
a
hundred
doubts
and
uncertainties
the
one
object
in
an
obscure
and
troubled
fate
and
their
response
had
almost
immediately
turned
his
task
into
a
pleasure
it
was
so
easy
to
rule
if
one
subjects
loved
one
and
so
easy
to
be
loved
if
only
one
loved
enough
in
return
if
he
did
not
like
the
pope
describe
himself
to
his
people
as
the
servant
of
the
servants
of
god
he
at
least
longed
to
make
them
feel
that
this
new
gospel
of
service
was
the
base
on
which
all
sovereignty
must
henceforth
repose
it
was
not
that
his
first
year
of
power
had
been
without
moments
of
disillusionment
he
had
had
more
than
one
embittering
experience
of
intrigue
and
perfidy
more
than
one
glimpse
of
the
pitfalls
besetting
his
course
but
his
confidence
in
his
own
powers
and
his
faith
in
his
people
remained
unshaken
and
with
two
such
beliefs
to
sustain
him
it
seemed
as
though
no
difficulties
would
prove
insurmountable
such
at
least
was
the
mood
in
which
on
the
morning
of
his
entry
into
pianura
he
prepared
to
face
his
subjects
strangely
enough
the
state
entry
began
at
ponte
di
po
the
very
spot
where
on
a
stormy
midnight
some
seven
years
earlier
the
new
duke
had
landed
a
fugitive
from
his
future
realm
here
according
to
an
ancient
custom
the
sovereign
awaited
the
arrival
of
his
ministers
and
court
and
then
taking
seat
in
his
state
barge
proceeded
by
water
to
pianura
followed
by
an
escort
of
galleys
a
great
tent
hung
with
tapestries
had
been
set
up
on
the
and
here
odo
awaited
the
approach
of
the
barge
as
it
touched
at
the
he
stepped
out
and
his
prime
minister
count
trescorre
advanced
toward
him
accompanied
by
the
dignitaries
of
the
court
trescorre
had
aged
in
the
intervening
years
his
delicate
features
had
withered
like
a
woman
and
the
fine
irony
of
his
smile
had
taken
an
edge
of
cruelty
his
face
suggested
a
worn
engraving
the
lines
of
which
have
been
deepened
by
a
instrument
the
functionaries
attending
him
were
with
few
exceptions
the
same
who
had
figured
in
a
like
capacity
at
the
late
sovereign
court
with
the
passing
of
the
years
they
had
grown
heavier
or
thinner
more
ponderous
or
stiffer
in
their
movements
and
as
they
advanced
in
their
splendid
but
unwieldy
court
dress
they
seemed
to
odo
like
superannuated
marionettes
whose
springs
and
wires
have
rusted
from
disuse
the
barge
was
a
magnificent
gilded
bucentaur
presented
to
the
late
duke
father
by
the
doge

here
the
new

seated
himself
surrounded
by
his

and
presently
the
heavy
craft
rowed
by
sixty
was
moving
slowly
up
the
river
toward
pianura
in
the
clear
spring
light
the
old
walled
city
with
its
domes
and
towers
rose
pleasantly
among
budding
orchards
and
fields
close
at
hand
were
the
crenellations
of

keep
and
just
beyond
the
ornate
cupola
of
the
royal
chapel
symbolising
in
their
proximity
the
successive
ambitions
of
the
ducal
race
while
the
campanile
of
the
cathedral
and
the
square
tower
of
the
mediaeval
sprang
up
side
by
side
marking
the
centre
of
the
free
city
which
the
valseccas
had
subjugated
it
seemed
to
the
new
duke
who
was
given
to
such
reflections
that
he
could
read
his
race
history
in
that
broken
skyline
but
he
was
soon
snatched
from
its
perusal
by
the
cheers
of
the
crowd
who
thronged
the
to
greet
his
approach
as
the
bucentaur
touched
at
the
and
odo
stepped
out
on
the
red
carpet
strewn
with
flowers
while
cannon
thundered
from
the
walls
and
the
bells
burst
into
renewed
jubilation
he
felt
himself
for
the
first
time
face
to
face
with
his
people
the
very
ceremonial
which
in
other
cases
kept
them
apart
was
now
a
means
of
closer
communication
for
it
was
to
show
himself
to
them
that
he
was
making
a
public
entry
into
his
capital
and
it
was
to
see
him
that
the
city
had
poured
forth
her
shouting
throngs
the
shouts
rose
and
widened
as
he
advanced
enveloping
him
in
a
mounting
tide
of
welcome
in
which
cannon
bells
and
voices
the
decreed
and
the
spontaneous
acclamations
were
indistinguishably
merged
in
like
manner
approbation
of
his
person
was
mingled
with
a
simple
enjoyment
of
the
show
of
which
he
formed
a
part
and
it
must
have
taken
a
more
experienced
head
than
odo
to
distinguish
between
the
two
currents
of
enthusiasm
on
which
he
felt
himself
swept
forward
the
pageant
was
indeed
brilliant
enough
to
justify
the
popular
transport
and
the
fact
that
the
new
duke
formed
a
worthy
centre
to
so
much
magnificence
was
not
lost
on
his
subjects
the
late
sovereign
had
so
long
held
himself
aloof
that
the
city
was
unaccustomed
to
such
shows
and
as
the
procession
wound
into
the
square
before
the
cathedral
where
the
thickest
of
the
crowd
was
massed
the
very
pealing
of
the
was
lost
in
the
roar
of
human
voices
don
serafino
the
bishop
nephew
and
now
master
of
the
horse
rode
first
on
a
splendid
charger
preceded
by
four
trumpets
and
followed
by
his
esquires
then
came
the
court
dignitaries
attended
by
their
pages
and
staffieri
in
gala
liveries
the
marshals
with
their
staves
the
masters
of
ceremony
and
the
clergy
mounted
on
mules
trapped
with
velvet
each
led
by
two
running
footmen
the
duke
rode
next
alone
and
somewhat
pale
two
pages
of
arms
helmeted
and
carrying
lances
walked
at
his
horse
bridle
and
behind
him
came
his
household
and
ministers
with
their
gentlemen
and
a
long
train
of
servants
followed
by
the
regiment
of
light
horse
which
closed
the
procession
the
houses
surrounding
the
square
afforded
the
best
point
of
view
to
those
unwilling
to
mix
with
the
crowd
in
the
streets
and
among
the
spectators
thronging
the
windows
and
balconies
and
leaning
over
the
edge
of
the
leads
were
many
who
from
one
motive
or
another
felt
a
personal
interest
in
the
new
duke
the
marchioness
of
boscofolto
had
accepted
a
seat
in
the
windows
of
the
pievepelaghi
palace
which
formed
an
angle
of
the
square
and
she
and
her
hostess
the
same
lady
who
had
been
relieved
of
her
diamond
necklace
by
footpads
suspected
of
wearing
the
duchess
livery
sat
observing
the
scene
behind
the
garlanded
balconies
of
the
piano
nobile
in
the
mezzanin
windows
of
a
neighbouring
the
bookseller

with
half
a
dozen
members
of
the

above

now
prior
of

and
said
to
be
withdrawn
from
political
life
seated
on
his
mule
he
observed
the
scene
with
impassive
face
while
from
his
place
in
the
long
line
of
minor
clergy
the
abate
crescenti
with
eyes
of
infinite
tenderness
and
concern
watched
the
young
duke
solemnly
ascending
the
cathedral
steps
in
the
porch
the
bishop
waited
impressive
as
ever
in
his
white
and
gold
dalmatic
against
the
red
robes
of
the
chapter
preceded
by
two
chamberlains
odo
mounted
the
steps
amid
the
sudden
silence
of
the
people
the
great
bronze
portals
of
the
cathedral
which
were
never
opened
save
on
occasions
of
state
swung
slowly
inward
pouring
a
wave
of
music
and
incense
out
upon
the
hushed
sunlit
square
then
they
closed
again
engulphing
the
brilliant
procession
the
duke
the
bishop
the
clergy
and
the
court
and
leaving
the
populace
to
scatter
in
search
of
the
diversions
prepared
for
them
at
every
it
was
not
till
late
that
night
that
the
new
duke
found
himself
alone
he
had
withdrawn
at
last
from
the
balcony
overlooking
the
square
whither
the
shouts
of
his
subjects
had
persistently
recalled
him
silence
was
falling
on
the
illuminated
streets
and
the
dimness
of
midnight
upon
the
sky
through
which
rocket
after
rocket
had
torn
its
brilliant
furrows
in
the
palace
a
profounder
stillness
reigned
since
his
accession
odo
out
of
respect
for
the
late
duke
had
lodged
in
one
of
the
wings
of
the
great
building
but
tradition
demanded
that
he
should
henceforth
inhabit
the
ducal
apartments
and
thither
at
the
close
of
the
day
ceremonies
his
gentlemen
had
conducted
him
trescorre
had
asked
permission
to
wait
on
him
before
he
slept
and
he
knew
that
the
prime
minister
would
be
kept
late
by
his
conference
with
the
secret
police
whose
nightly
report
could
not
be
handed
in
till
the
festivities
were
over
meanwhile
odo
was
in
no
mood
for
sleep
he
sat
alone
in
the
closet
still
hung
with
saints
images
and
jewelled
reliquaries
where
his
cousin
had
so
often
given
him
audience
and
whence
through
the
open
door
he
could
see
the
embroidered
curtains
and
plumed
baldachin
of
the
state
bed
which
was
presently
to
receive
him
all
day
his
heart
had
beat
with
high
ambitions
but
now
a
weight
sank
upon
his
spirit
the
reaction
from
the
tumultuous
welcome
of
the
streets
to
the
silence
of
the
palace
made
him
feel
how
unreal
was
the
fancied
union
between
himself
and
his
people
how
insuperable
the
distance
that
tradition
and
habit
had
placed
between
them
in
the
narrow
closet
where
his
predecessor
had
taken
refuge
from
the
detested
task
of
reigning
the
new
duke
felt
the
same
moral
lassitude
steal
over
him
how
was
such
a
puny
will
as
his
to
contend
against
the
great
forces
of
greed
and
prejudice
all
the
influences
arrayed
against
him
tradition
superstition
the
lust
of
power
the
arrogance
of
race
seemed
concentrated
in
the
atmosphere
of
that
silent
room
with
its
guarded
threshold
its
pious
relics
and
lying
on
the
desk
in
the
embrasure
of
the
window
the
manuscript
litany
which
the
late
duke
had
not
lived
to
complete
oppressed
by
his
surroundings
odo
rose
and
entered
the
a
lamp
burned
before
the
image
of
the
madonna
at
the
head
of
the
bed
and
two
lighted
flambeaux
flanked
the
picture
of
the
last
judgment
on
the
opposite
wall
odo
remembered
the
look
of
terror
which
the
duke
had
fixed
on
the
picture
during
their
first
strange
conversation
a
stood
beneath
it
and
it
was
said
that
here
rather
than
before
the
virgin
image
the
melancholy
prince
performed
his
private
devotions
the
horrors
of
the
scene
were
depicted
with
a
childish
minuteness
of
detail
as
though
the
painter
had
sought
to
produce
an
impression
of
moral
anguish
by
the
accumulation
of
physical
sufferings
and
just
such
puerile
images
of
the
wrath
to
come
may
have
haunted
the
mysterious
recesses
of
the
duke
imagination
crescenti
had
told
odo
how
the
dying
man
thoughts
had
seemed
to
centre
upon
this
dreadful
subject
and
how
again
and
again
amid
his
ravings
he
had
cried
out
that
the
picture
must
be
burned
as
though
the
sight
of
it
was
become
intolerable
to
him
odo
own
mind
across
which
the
events
and
emotions
of
the
day
still
threw
the
fantastic
shadows
of
an
expiring
illumination
was
wrought
to
the
highest
state
of
impressionability
he
saw
in
a
flash
all
that
the
picture
must
have
symbolised
to
his
cousin
fancy
and
in
his
desire
to
reconstruct
that
dying
vision
of
fleshly
retribution
he
stepped
close
to
the
diptych
resting
a
knee
on
the
stool
beneath
it
as
he
did
so
the
picture
suddenly
opened
disclosing
the
inner
panel
odo
caught
up
one
of
the
flambeaux
and
in
its
light
as
on
a
sunlit
wave
there
stepped
forth
to
him
the
lost
venus
of
giorgione
he
knew
the
picture
in
an
instant
there
was
no
mistaking
the
glow
of
the
limbs
the
midsummer
languor
of
the
smile
the
magical
atmosphere
in
which
the
gold
of
sunlight
of
autumn
leaves
of
amber
grapes
seemed
fused
by
some
lost
alchemy
of
the
brush
as
he
gazed
the
scene
changed
and
he
saw
himself
in
a
darkened
room
with
cabalistic
hangings
he
saw
heiligenstern
tall
figure
towering
in
supernatural
light
the
duke
leaning
eagerly
forward
the
duchess
with
set
lips
and
troubled
eyes
the
little
prince
bent
wonderingly
above
the
magic
crystal
a
step
in
the
antechamber
announced
trescorre
approach
odo
returned
to
the
cabinet
and
the
minister
advanced
with
a
low
bow
the
two
men
had
had
time
to
grow
accustomed
to
the
new
relation
in
which
they
stood
to
one
another
yet
there
were
moments
when
to
odo
the
past
seemed
to
lie
like
fallen
leaves
beneath
trescorre
steps
donna
laura
fond
and
foolish
in
her
weeds
gamba
momola
and
the
pure
featherhead
cerveno
dying
at
nineteen
of
a
distemper
because
he
had
stood
in
the
way
the
impression
was
strong
on
him
now
but
it
was
only
momentary
habit
reasserted
itself
and
the
minister
effaced
the
man
odo
signed
to
trescorre
to
seat
himself
and
the
latter
silently
presented
his
report
he
was
a
diligent
and
capable
administrator
and
however
mixed
might
be
the
motives
which
attached
him
to
his
sovereign
they
did
not
interfere
with
the
exact
performance
of
his
duties
odo
knew
this
and
was
grateful
for
it
he
knew
that
trescorre
ambitious
of
the
regency
had
intrigued
against
him
to
the
last
he
knew
that
an
intemperate
love
of
power
was
the
mainspring
of
that
seemingly
dispassionate
nature
but
death
had
crossed
trescorre
schemes
and
he
was
too
adroit
an
opportunist
not
to
see
that
his
best
chance
now
lay
in
making
himself
indispensable
to
his
new
sovereign
of
all
this
odo
was
aware
but
his
own
motives
in
appointing
trescorre
did
not
justify
his
looking
for
great
disinterestedness
in
his
minister
the
irony
of
circumstances
had
forced
them
upon
each
other
and
each
knew
that
the
other
understood
the
situation
and
was
prepared
to
make
the
best
of
it
the
duke
presently
rose
and
handed
back
to
trescorre
the
reports
of
the
secret
police
they
were
the
documents
he
most
disliked
to
handle
you
have
acquitted
yourself
admirably
of
your
disagreeable
duties
he
said
with
a
smile
i
hope
i
have
done
as
well
at
any
rate
the
day
is
over
trescorre
returned
the
smile
with
his
usual
tinge
of
irony
another
has
already
begun
said
he
ah
said
odo
with
a
touch
of
impatience
are
we
not
to
sleep
on
our
laurels
trescorre
bowed
austria
your
highness
never
sleeps
odo
looked
at
him
with
surprise
what
do
you
mean
that
i
have
to
remind
your
highness
of
what
trescorre
had
one
of
his
characteristic
pauses
that
the
duke
of
monte
alloro
is
in
failing
health
and
that
her
highness
year
of
widowhood
ended
yesterday
there
was
a
silence
odo
who
had
reseated
himself
rose
and
walked
to
the
window
the
shutters
stood
open
and
he
looked
out
over
the
formless
obscurity
of
the
gardens
above
the
intervening
masses
of
foliage
the
borromini
wing
raised
its
vague
grey
bulk
he
saw
lights
in
maria
clementina
apartments
and
wondered
if
she
still
waked
an
hour
or
two
earlier
she
had
given
him
her
hand
in
the
at
the
state
ball
it
was
her
first
public
appearance
since
the
late
duke
death
and
with
the
laying
off
of
her
weeds
she
had
regained
something
of
her
former
brilliancy
at
the
moment
he
had
hardly
observed
her
she
had
seemed
a
mere
inanimate
part
of
the
pageant
of
which
he
formed
the
throbbing
centre
but
now
the
sense
of
her
nearness
pressed
upon
him
she
seemed
close
to
him
ingrown
with
his
fate
and
with
the
curious
duality
of
vision
that
belongs
to
such
moments
he
beheld
her
again
as
she
had
first
shone
on
him
the
imperious
child
whom
he
had
angered
by
stroking
her
spaniel
the
radiant
girl
who
had
welcomed
him
on
his
return
to
pianura
trescorre
voice
aroused
him
at
any
moment
the
minister
was
saying
her
highness
may
fall
heir
to
monte
alloro
it
is
the
moment
for
which
austria
waits
there
is
always
an
archduke
ready
and
her
highness
is
still
a
young
woman
odo
turned
slowly
from
the
window
i
have
told
you
that
this
is
impossible
he
murmured
trescorre
looked
down
and
thoughtfully
fingered
the
documents
in
his
hands
your
highness
said
he
is
as
as
your
ministers
with
the
difficulties
that
beset
us
monte
alloro
is
one
of
the
richest
states
in
italy
it
is
a
pity
to
alienate
such
revenues
from
pianura
the
new
duke
was
silent
his
minister
words
were
merely
the
audible
expression
of
his
own
thoughts
he
knew
that
the
future
welfare
of
pianura
depended
on
the
annexation
of
monte
alloro
he
owed
it
to
his
people
to
unite
the
two
sovereignties
at
length
he
said
you
are
building
on
an
unwarrantable
assumption
trescorre
raised
an
interrogative
glance
you
assume
her
highness
consent
the
minister
again
paused
and
his
pause
seemed
to
flash
an
ironical
light
on
the
poverty
of
the
other
defences
i
come
straight
from
her
highness
said
he
quietly
and
i
assume
nothing
that
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
affirm
odo
turned
on
him
with
a
start
do
i
understand
that
you
have
presumed
his
minister
raised
a
deprecating
hand
sir
said
he
the
envoy
is
in
pianura
odo
on
his
return
to
pianura
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
de
crucis
would
remain
in
his
service
there
had
been
little
talk
between
the
two
on
the
way
the
one
was
deep
in
his
own
wretchedness
and
the
other
had
too
fine
a
tact
to
intrude
on
it
but
odo
felt
the
nearness
of
that
penetrating
sympathy
which
was
almost
a
gift
of
divination
he
was
glad
to
have
de
crucis
at
his
side
at
a
moment
when
any
other
companionship
had
been
intolerable
and
in
the
egotism
of
his
misery
he
imagined
that
he
could
dispose
as
he
pleased
of
his
friend
future
after
the
little
prince
death
however
de
crucis
had
at
once
asked
permission
to
leave
pianura
he
was
perhaps
not
displeased
by
expressions
of
surprise
and
disappointment
but
they
did
not
alter
his
decision
he
reminded
the
new
duke
that
he
had
been
called
to
pianura
as
governor
to
the
late
heir
and
that
death
having
cut
short
his
task
he
had
now
no
farther
pretext
for
remaining
odo
listened
with
a
strange
sense
of
loneliness
the
responsibilities
of
his
new
state
weighed
heavily
on
the
musing
speculative
side
of
his
nature
face
to
face
with
the
sudden
summons
to
action
with
the
necessity
for
prompt
and
not
choice
of
means
and
method
he
felt
a
stealing
apathy
of
the
will
an
inclination
toward
the
subtle
duality
of
judgment
that
had
so
often
weakened
and
diffused
his
energies
at
such
a
crisis
it
seemed
to
him
that
de
crucis
gone
he
remained
without
a
friend
he
urged
the
abate
to
reconsider
his
decision
begging
him
to
choose
a
post
about
his
person
de
crucis
shook
his
head
the
offer
said
he
is
more
tempting
to
me
than
your
highness
can
guess
but
my
business
here
is
at
an
end
and
must
be
taken
up
elsewhere
my
calling
is
that
of
a
pedagogue
when
i
was
summoned
to
take
charge
of
prince
ferrante
education
i
gave
up
my
position
in
the
household
of
prince
bracciano
not
only
because
i
believed
that
i
could
make
myself
more
useful
in
training
a
future
sovereign
than
the
son
of
a
private
nobleman
but
also
he
added
with
a
smile
because
i
was
curious
to
visit
a
state
of
which
your
highness
had
so
often
spoken
and
because
i
believed
that
my
residence
here
might
enable
me
to
be
of
service
to
your
highness
in
this
i
was
not
mistaken
and
i
will
gladly
remain
in
pianura
long
enough
to
give
your
highness
such
counsels
as
my
experience
suggests
but
that
business
discharged
i
must
ask
leave
to
go
from
this
position
no
entreaties
could
move
him
and
so
fixed
was
his
resolve
that
it
confirmed
the
idea
that
he
was
still
a
secret
agent
of
the
jesuits
strangely
enough
this
did
not
prejudice
odo
who
was
more
than
ever
under
the
spell
of
de
crucis
personal
influence
though
odo
had
been
acquainted
with
many
professed
philosophers
he
had
never
met
among
them
a
character
so
nearly
resembling
the
old
stoical
ideal
of
temperance
and
serenity
and
he
could
never
be
long
with
de
crucis
without
reflecting
that
the
training
which
could
form
and
nourish
so
noble
a
nature
must
be
other
than
the
world
conceived
it
de
crucis
however
frankly
pointed
out
that
his
former
connection
with
the
jesuits
was
too
well
known
in
pianura
not
to
be
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
his
usefulness
i
own
said
he
that
before
the
late
duke
death
i
exerted
such
influence
as
i
possessed
to
bring
about
your
highness
appointment
as
regent
but
the
very
connections
that
favoured
me
with
your
predecessor
must
stand
in
the
way
of
my
serving
your
highness
nothing
could
be
more
fatal
to
your
prospects
than
to
have
it
said
that
you
had
chosen
a
former
jesuit
as
your
advisor
in
the
present
juncture
of
affairs
it
is
needful
that
you
should
appear
to
be
in
sympathy
with
the
liberals
and
that
whatever
reforms
you
attempt
should
seem
the
result
of
popular
pressure
rather
than
of
your
own
free
choice
such
an
attitude
may
not
flatter
the
sovereign
pride
and
is
in
fact
merely
a
higher
form
of
expediency
but
it
is
one
which
the
proudest
monarchs
of
europe
are
finding
themselves
constrained
to
take
if
they
would
preserve
their
power
and
use
it
effectually
soon
afterward
de
crucis
left
pianura
but
before
leaving
he
imparted
to
odo
the
result
of
his
observations
while
in
the
late
duke
service
de
crucis
view
was
that
of
the
more
thoughtful
men
of
his
day
who
had
not
broken
with
the
church
yet
were
conscious
that
the
whole
social
system
of
europe
was
in
need
of
renovation
the
movement
of
ideas
in
france
and
their
rapid
transformation
into
legislative
measures
of
unforeseen
importance
had
as
yet
made
little
impression
in
italy
and
the
clergy
in
particular
lived
in
serene
unconsciousness
of
any
impending
change
de
crucis
however
had
been
much
in
france
and
had
frequented
the
french
churchmen
who
save
in
the
highest
ranks
of
the
hierarchy
were
keenly
alive
to
the
need
of
reform
and
ready
in
many
instances
to
sacrifice
their
own
privileges
in
the
public
cause
these
men
living
in
their
provincial
cures
or
abbeys
were
necessarily
in
closer
contact
with
the
people
better
acquainted
with
their
needs
and
more
competent
to
relieve
them
than
the
city
demagogues
theorising
in
parisian
on
the
rights
of
man
and
the
code
of
nature
but
the
voice
of
the
demagogues
carried
farther
than
that
of
the
clergy
and
such
revolutionary
notions
as
crossed
the
alps
had
more
to
do
with
the
founding
of
future
utopias
than
with
the
remedy
of
present
evils
even
in
france
the
temperate
counsels
of
the
clergy
were
being
overruled
by
the
sentimental
imprudences
of
the
nobles
and
by
the
bluster
of
the
politicians
it
was
to
put
odo
on
his
guard
against
these
two
influences
that
de
crucis
was
chiefly
anxious
but
the
intelligent
cooperation
of
the
clergy
was
sadly
lacking
in
his
administrative
scheme
he
knew
that
odo
could
not
count
on
the
support
of
the
church
party
and
that
he
must
make
what
use
he
could
of
the
liberals
in
his
attempts
at
reform
the
clergy
of
pianura
had
been
in
power
too
long
to
believe
in
the
necessity
of
conceding
anything
to
the
new
spirit
and
since
the
banishment
of
the
society
of
jesus
the
presumption
of
the
other
orders
had
increased
instead
of
diminishing
the
priests
whatever
their
failings
had
attached
the
needy
by
a
lavish
bounty
and
they
had
a
powerful
auxiliary
in
the
madonna
of
the
mountain
who
drew
pilgrims
from
all
parts
of
italy
and
thus
contributed
to
the
material
welfare
of
the
state
as
well
as
to
its
spiritual
privileges
to
the
common
people
their
virgin
was
not
only
a
protection
against
disease
and
famine
but
a
kind
of
oracle
who
by
divers
signs
and
tokens
gave
evidence
of
divine
approval
or
displeasure
and
it
was
naturally
to
the
priests
that
the
faithful
looked
for
a
reading
of
these
phenomena
this
gave
the
clergy
a
powerful
hold
on
the
religious
sensibilities
of
the
people
and
more
than
once
the
manifest
disapproval
of
the
mountain
madonna
had
turned
the
scales
against
some
economic
measure
which
threatened
the
rights
of
her
augurs
de
crucis
understood
the
force
of
these
traditional
influences
but
odo
in
common
with
the
more
cultivated
men
of
his
day
had
lived
too
long
in
an
atmosphere
of
polite
scepticism
to
measure
the
profound
hold
of
religion
on
the
consciousness
of
the
people
christ
had
been
so
long
banished
from
the
that
it
was
has
hard
to
believe
that
he
still
ruled
in
field
and
vineyard
to
men
of
odo
stamp
the
piety
of
the
masses
was
a
mere
superficial
growth
a
kind
of
mental
mould
to
be
dried
off
by
the
first
beams
of
knowledge
he
did
not
conceive
it
as
a
habit
of
thought
so
old
that
it
had
become
instinctive
so
closely
intertwined
with
every
sense
that
to
hope
to
eradicate
it
was
like
trying
to
drain
all
the
blood
from
a
man
body
without
killing
him
he
knew
nothing
of
the
unwearied
workings
of
that
power
patient
as
a
natural
force
which
to
reach
spirits
darkened
by
ignorance
and
eyes
dulled
by
toil
had
stooped
to
a
thousand
disguises
humble
tender
and
grotesque
peopling
the
earth
with
a
new
race
of
avenging
or
protecting
deities
guarding
the
babe
in
the
cradle
and
the
cattle
in
the
stalls
blessing
the
good
man
vineyard
or
blighting
the
crops
of
the
blasphemer
guiding
the
lonely
traveller
over
torrents
and
precipices
smoothing
the
sea
and
hushing
the
whirlwind
praying
with
the
mother
over
her
sick
child
and
watching
beside
the
dead
in
and
lazaret
and
galley
entering
into
every
joy
and
grief
of
the
obscurest
consciousness
penetrating
to
depths
of
misery
which
no
human
compassion
ever
reached
and
redressing
by
a
prompt
and
summary
justice
wrongs
of
which
no
human
legislation
took
account
odo
first
act
after
his
accession
had
been
to
recall
the
political
offenders
banished
by
his
predecessor
and
so
general
was
the
custom
of
marking
the
opening
of
a
new
reign
by
an
amnesty
to
political
exiles
that
trescorre
offered
no
opposition
to
the
measure
andreoni
and
his
friends
at
once
returned
to
pianura
and
gamba
at
the
same
time
emerged
from
his
mysterious
he
was
the
only
one
of
the
group
who
struck
odo
as
having
any
administrative
capacity
yet
he
was
more
likely
to
be
of
use
as
a
pamphleteer
than
as
an
as
to
the
other
philosophers
they
were
what
their
name
implied
thoughtful
and
men
with
a
generous
conception
of
their
civic
duties
and
a
noble
readiness
to
fulfil
them
at
any
cost
but
untrained
to
action
and
totally
ignorant
of
the
complex
science
of
government
odo
found
the
hunchback
changed
he
had
withered
like
trescorre
but
under
the
harsher
blight
of
physical
privations
and
his
tongue
had
an
added
bitterness
he
replied
evasively
to
all
enquiries
as
to
what
had
become
of
him
during
his
absence
from
pianura
but
on
odo
asking
for
news
of
momola
and
the
child
he
said
coldly
they
are
both
dead
dead
odo
exclaimed
together
there
was
scarce
an
hour
between
them
gamba
answered
she
said
she
must
keep
alive
as
long
as
the
boy
needed
her
after
that
she
turned
on
her
side
and
died
but
of
what
disorder
how
came
they
to
sicken
at
the
same
time
the
hunchback
stood
silent
his
eyes
on
the
ground
suddenly
he
raised
them
and
looked
full
at
the
duke
those
that
saw
them
called
it
the
plague
the
plague
good
god
odo
slowly
returned
his
stare
is
it
possible
he
paused
that
she
too
was
at
the
feast
of
the
madonna
she
was
there
but
it
was
not
there
that
she
contracted
the
distemper
not
there
no
for
she
dragged
herself
from
her
bed
to
go
there
was
another
silence
the
hunchback
had
lowered
his
eyes
the
duke
sat
motionless
resting
his
head
on
his
hand
suddenly
he
made
a
gesture
of
dismissal
two
months
after
his
state
entry
into
pianura
odo
married
his
widow
it
surprised
him
in
looking
back
to
see
how
completely
the
thought
of
maria
clementina
had
passed
out
of
his
life
how
wholly
he
had
ceased
to
reckon
with
her
as
one
of
the
factors
in
his
destiny
at
her
he
had
seen
in
her
only
the
stricken
mother
centred
in
her
loss
and
recalling
in
an
agony
of
tears
the
little
prince
prophetic
vision
of
the
winged
playmates
who
came
to
him
carrying
toys
from
paradise
after
prince
ferrante
death
she
had
gone
on
a
long
visit
to
her
uncle
of
monte
alloro
and
since
her
return
to
pianura
she
had
lived
in
the
refusing
odo
offer
of
a
palace
in
the
town
she
had
first
shown
herself
to
the
public
on
the
day
of
the
state
entry
and
now
her
year
of
widowhood
over
she
was
again
the
consort
of
a
reigning
duke
of
pianura
no
one
was
more
ignorant
than
her
husband
of
the
motives
determining
her
act
as
duchess
of
monte
alloro
she
might
have
enjoyed
the
wealth
and
independence
which
her
uncle
death
had
bestowed
on
her
but
in
marrying
again
she
resigned
the
right
to
her
new
possessions
which
became
vested
in
the
crown
of
pianura
was
it
love
that
had
prompted
the
sacrifice
as
she
stood
beside
him
on
the
altar
steps
of
the
cathedral
as
she
rode
home
beside
him
between
their
shouting
subjects
odo
asked
himself
the
question
again
and
again
the
years
had
dealt
lightly
with
her
and
she
had
crossed
the
threshold
of
the
thirties
with
the
assured
step
of
a
woman
who
has
no
cause
to
fear
what
awaits
her
but
her
blood
no
longer
spoke
her
thoughts
and
the
transparence
of
youth
had
changed
to
a
brilliant
density
he
could
not
penetrate
beneath
the
surface
of
her
smile
she
seemed
to
him
like
a
beautiful
toy
which
might
conceal
a
lacerating
weapon
meanwhile
between
himself
and
any
better
understanding
of
her
stood
the
remembrance
of
their
talk
in
the
of
pontesordo
what
she
had
offered
then
he
had
refused
to
take
was
she
the
woman
to
forget
such
a
refusal
was
it
not
rather
to
keep
its
memory
alive
that
she
had
married
him
or
was
she
but
the
flighty
girl
he
had
once
imagined
her
driven
hither
and
thither
by
spasmodic
impulses
and
incapable
of
consistent
action
whether
for
good
or
ill
the
barrier
of
their
past
of
all
that
lay
unsaid
and
undone
between
them
so
completely
cut
her
off
from
him
that
he
had
in
her
presence
the
strange
sensation
of
a
man
who
believes
himself
to
be
alone
yet
feels
that
he
is
watched
the
first
months
of
their
marriage
were
oppressed
by
this
sense
of
constraint
but
gradually
habit
bridged
the
distance
between
them
and
he
found
himself
at
once
nearer
to
her
and
less
acutely
aware
of
her
in
the
second
year
an
heir
was
born
and
died
and
the
hopes
and
grief
thus
shared
drew
them
insensibly
into
the
relation
of
the
ordinary
husband
and
wife
knitted
together
at
the
roots
in
spite
of
superficial
divergencies
in
his
passionate
need
of
sympathy
and
counsel
odo
longed
to
make
the
most
of
this
enforced
community
of
interests
already
his
first
zeal
was
flagging
his
belief
in
his
mission
wavering
he
needed
the
encouragement
of
a
kindred
faith
he
had
no
hope
of
finding
in
maria
clementina
that
pure
passion
for
justice
which
seemed
to
him
the
noblest
ardour
of
the
soul
he
had
read
it
in
one
woman
eyes
but
these
had
long
been
turned
from
him
unconsciously
perhaps
he
counted
rather
on
his
wife
less
generous
qualities
the
passion
for
dominion
the
blind
arrogance
of
temper
that
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
making
her
power
felt
had
so
often
drawn
her
into
public
affairs
might
not
this
waste
force
which
implied
after
all
a
certain
prodigality
of
courage
be
used
for
good
as
well
as
evil
might
not
his
influence
make
of
the
undisciplined
creature
at
his
side
an
unconscious
instrument
in
the
great
work
of
order
and
reconstruction
his
first
appeal
to
her
brought
the
answer
at
his
request
his
ministers
had
drawn
up
a
plan
of
financial
reorganisation
which
should
include
the
two
duchies
for
monte
alloro
though
wealthier
than
pianura
was
in
even
greater
need
of
fiscal
reform
as
a
first
step
towards
replenishing
the
treasury
the
duke
had
declared
himself
ready
to
limit
his
private
expenditure
to
a
fixed
sum
and
he
now
asked
the
duchess
to
pledge
herself
in
the
same
manner
maria
clementina
since
her
uncle
death
had
been
in
receipt
of
a
third
of
the
annual
revenues
of
monte
alloro
this
should
have
enabled
her
to
pay
her
debts
and
put
some
dignity
and
order
into
her
establishment
but
the
first
year
income
had
gone
in
the
building
of
a
villa
on
the
piana
in
imitation
of
the
along
the
brenta
the
second
was
spent
in
establishing
a
menagerie
of
wild
animals
like
that
of
the
french
queen
at
versailles
and
rumour
had
it
that
the
duchess
carried
her
imitation
of
her
royal
cousin
so
far
as
to
be
involved
in
an
ugly
quarrel
with
her
jewellers
about
a
necklace
for
which
she
owed
a
thousand
ducats
all
these
reports
had
of
course
reached
odo
but
he
still
hoped
that
an
appeal
to
her
love
of
dominion
might
prove
stronger
than
the
habit
of
he
said
to
himself
that
nothing
had
ever
been
done
to
rouse
her
ambition
that
hitherto
if
she
had
meddled
in
politics
it
had
been
merely
from
thwarted
vanity
or
the
desire
to
gratify
some
personal
spite
now
he
hoped
to
take
her
by
higher
passions
and
by
associating
her
with
his
own
schemes
to
utilise
her
dormant
energies
for
the
first
moments
she
listened
with
the
strained
fixity
of
a
child
then
her
attention
flickered
and
died
out
the
habit
of
referring
every
question
to
a
personal
standpoint
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
follow
a
general
argument
and
she
leaned
back
with
the
resigned
eyelids
of
piety
under
the
pulpit
odo
resolved
to
be
patient
and
seeing
that
the
subject
was
too
large
for
her
tried
to
take
it
apart
putting
it
before
her
bit
by
bit
and
at
such
an
angle
that
she
should
catch
her
own
reflection
in
it
he
thought
to
take
her
by
the
austrian
side
touching
on
the
antagonism
between
vienna
and
rome
on
the
reforms
of
the
tuscan
on
the
emperor
joseph
open
defiance
of
the
church
feudal
claims
but
she
scented
a
personal
application
my
cousin
the
emperor
should
be
a
priest
himself
she
shrugged
for
he
belongs
to
the
preaching
order
he
never
goes
to
france
but
he
gives
the
poor
queen
such
a
scolding
that
her
eyes
are
red
for
a
week
has
joseph
been
trying
to
set
our
house
in
order
discouraged
but
more
than
ever
bent
on
patience
he
tried
the
chord
of
vanity
of
her
love
of
popularity
the
people
called
her
the
beautiful
duchess
why
not
let
history
name
her
the
great
but
the
mention
of
history
was
unfortunate
it
reminded
her
of
her
and
of
the
stupid
greeks
and
romans
whose
dates
she
could
never
recall
she
hoped
she
should
never
be
anything
so
dull
as
an
historical
personage
and
besides
greatness
was
for
the
men
it
was
enough
for
a
princess
to
be
virtuous
and
she
looked
as
edifying
as
her
own
epitaph
he
caught
this
up
and
tried
to
make
her
distinguish
between
the
public
and
the
private
virtues
but
the
word
responsibility
slipped
from
him
and
he
felt
her
stiffen
this
was
preaching
and
she
hated
preaching
even
more
than
history
her
attention
strayed
again
and
he
rallied
his
forces
in
a
last
appeal
but
he
knew
it
was
a
lost
battle
every
argument
broke
against
the
close
front
of
her
indifference
he
was
talking
a
language
she
had
never
learned
it
was
all
as
remote
from
her
as
church
latin
a
princess
did
not
need
to
know
latin
she
let
her
eye
linger
suggestively
on
the
clock
it
was
a
fine
hunting
morning
and
she
had
meant
to
kill
a
stag
in
the
caccia
del
vescovo
when
he
began
to
sum
up
and
the
question
narrowed
to
a
direct
appeal
her
eyes
left
the
clock
and
returned
to
him
now
she
was
listening
he
pressed
on
to
the
matter
of
retrenchment
would
she
join
him
would
she
help
to
make
the
great
work
possible
at
first
she
seemed
hardly
to
understand
but
as
his
meaning
grew
clear
to
her
is
the
money
no
longer
ours
she
exclaimed
he
hesitated
i
suppose
it
is
as
much
ours
as
ever
he
said
and
how
much
is
that
she
asked
impatiently
it
is
ours
as
a
trust
for
our
people
she
stared
in
honest
wonder
these
were
new
signs
in
her
heaven
a
trust
a
trust
i
am
not
sure
that
i
know
what
that
means
is
the
money
ours
or
theirs
he
hesitated
in
strict
honour
it
is
ours
only
as
long
as
we
spend
it
for
their
benefit
she
turned
aside
to
examine
an
enamelled
by
van
blarenberghe
which
the
court
jeweller
had
newly
received
from
paris
when
she
raised
her
eyes
she
said
and
if
we
do
not
spend
it
for
their
benefit
odo
glanced
about
the
room
he
looked
at
the
delicate
adornment
of
the
walls
the
curtains
of
lyons
damask
the
crystal
girandoles
the
toys
in
porcelain
of
saxony
and
sevres
in
bronze
and
ivory
and
chinese
lacquer
crowding
the
tables
and
cabinets
of
inlaid
wood
overhead
floated
a
rosy
allegory
by
luca
giordano
underfoot
lay
a
carpet
of
the
royal
manufactory
of
france
and
through
the
open
windows
he
heard
the
plash
of
the
garden
fountains
and
saw
the
alignment
of
the
long
green
alleys
set
with
the
statues
of
roman
patriots
then
said
he
and
the
words
sounded
strangely
in
his
own
ears
then
they
may
take
it
from
us
some
day
and
all
this
with
it
to
the
very
toy
you
are
playing
with
she
rose
and
from
her
fullest
height
dropped
a
brilliant
smile
on
him
then
her
eyes
turned
to
the
portrait
of
the
great
fighting
duke
set
in
the
monumental
stucchi
of
the
if
you
take
after
your
ancestors
you
will
know
how
to
defend
it
she
said
the
new
duke
sat
in
his
closet
the
walls
had
been
stripped
of
their
pious
relics
and
lined
with
books
and
above
the
fireplace
hung
the
venus
of
giorgione
liberated
at
last
from
her
long
imprisonment
the
windows
stood
open
admitting
the
soft
september
air
twilight
had
fallen
on
the
gardens
and
through
it
a
young
moon
floated
above
the
cypresses
on
just
such
an
evening
three
years
earlier
he
had
ridden
down
the
slope
of
the
monte
baldo
with
fulvia
vivaldi
at
his
side
how
often
since
he
had
relived
the
incidents
of
that
night
with
singular
precision
they
succeeded
each
other
in
his
thoughts
he
felt
the
wild
sweep
of
the
storm
across
the
lake
the
warmth
of
her
nearness
the
sense
of
her
complete
trust
in
him
then
their
arrival
at
the
inn
the
dazzle
of
light
as
they
crossed
the
threshold
and
de
crucis
confronting
them
within
he
heard
her
voice
pleading
with
him
in
every
accent
that
pride
and
tenderness
and
a
noble
loyalty
could
command
he
felt
her
will
slowly
dominating
his
like
a
supernatural
power
forcing
him
into
his
destined
path
he
felt
and
with
how
profound
an
irony
of
spirit
the
passion
of
in
which
he
had
taken
up
his
task
he
had
known
moments
of
happiness
since
moments
when
he
believed
in
himself
and
in
his
calling
and
felt
himself
indeed
the
man
she
thought
him
that
was
in
the
exaltation
of
the
first
months
when
his
opportunities
had
seemed
as
boundless
as
his
dreams
and
he
had
not
yet
learned
that
the
sovereign
power
may
be
a
kind
of
spiritual
prison
to
the
man
since
then
indeed
he
had
known
another
kind
of
happiness
had
been
aware
of
a
secret
voice
whispering
within
him
that
she
was
right
and
had
chosen
wisely
for
him
but
this
was
when
he
had
realised
that
he
lived
in
a
prison
and
had
begun
to
admire
the
sumptuous
adornment
of
its
walls
for
a
while
the
mere
external
show
of
power
amused
him
and
his
imagination
was
charmed
by
the
historic
dignity
of
his
surroundings
in
such
a
setting
against
the
background
of
such
a
past
it
seemed
easy
to
play
the
benefactor
and
friend
of
the
people
his
sensibility
was
touched
by
the
contrast
and
he
saw
himself
as
a
picturesque
figure
linking
the
new
dreams
of
liberty
and
equality
to
the
feudal
traditions
of
a
thousand
years
but
this
masquerading
soon
ceased
to
divert
him
the
round
of
court
ceremonial
wearied
him
and
books
and
art
lost
their
fascination
the
more
he
varied
his
amusements
the
more
monotonous
they
became
the
more
he
crowded
his
life
with
petty
duties
the
more
empty
of
achievement
it
seemed
at
first
he
had
hoped
to
bury
his
personal
disappointments
in
the
task
of
reconstructing
his
little
state
but
on
every
side
he
felt
a
mute
resistance
to
his
efforts
the
philosophical
faction
had
indeed
poured
forth
pamphlets
celebrating
his
reforms
and
comparing
his
reign
to
the
return
of
the
golden
age
but
it
was
not
for
the
philosophers
that
he
laboured
and
the
benefits
of
free
speech
a
free
press
a
secular
education
did
not
after
all
reach
those
over
whom
his
heart
yearned
it
was
the
people
he
longed
to
serve
and
the
people
were
hungry
were
were
crushed
with
tithes
and
taxes
it
was
hopeless
to
try
to
reach
them
by
the
diffusion
of
popular
knowledge
they
must
first
be
fed
and
clothed
and
before
they
could
be
fed
and
clothed
the
chains
of
feudalism
must
be
broken
men
like
gamba
and
andreoni
saw
this
clearly
enough
but
it
was
not
from
them
that
help
could
come
the
nobility
and
clergy
must
be
coaxed
or
coerced
into
sympathy
with
the
new
movement
and
to
accomplish
this
exceeded
odo
powers
in
france
the
revolt
from
feudalism
had
found
some
of
its
boldest
leaders
in
the
very
class
that
had
most
to
lose
by
the
change
but
in
italy
fewer
causes
were
at
work
to
set
such
disinterested
passions
in
motion
south
of
the
alps
liberalism
was
merely
one
of
the
new
fashions
from
france
the
men
ran
after
the
pamphlets
from
paris
as
the
women
ran
after
the
cosmetics
and
the
politics
went
no
deeper
than
the
powder
even
among
the
freest
intellects
liberalism
resulted
in
a
new
way
of
thinking
rather
in
a
new
way
of
living
nowhere
among
the
better
classes
was
there
any
desire
to
attack
existing
institutions
the
church
had
never
troubled
the
latin
consciousness
the
renaissance
had
taught
cultivated
italians
how
to
live
at
peace
with
a
creed
in
which
they
no
longer
believed
and
their
scepticism
was
combined
with
a
traditional
conviction
that
the
priest
knew
better
than
any
one
how
to
deal
with
the
poor
and
that
the
clergy
were
of
distinct
use
in
relieving
the
individual
conscience
of
its
obligation
to
its
fellows
it
was
against
such
habits
of
thought
that
odo
had
to
struggle
centuries
of
fierce
individualism
or
of
sullen
apathy
under
a
foreign
rule
had
left
the
italians
incapable
of
any
concerted
political
action
but
suspicion
avarice
and
vanity
combined
with
a
lurking
fear
of
the
church
united
all
parties
in
a
kind
of
passive
opposition
to
reform
thus
the
duke
resolve
to
put
the
university
under
lay
direction
had
excited
the
enmity
of
the
barnabites
who
had
been
at
its
head
since
the
suppression
of
the
society
of
jesus
his
efforts
to
partition
among
the
peasantry
the
caccia
del
vescovo
that
great
waste
domain
of
the
see
of
pianura
had
roused
a
storm
of
fear
among
all
who
laid
claim
to
feudal
rights
and
his
own
personal
attempts
at
retrenchment
which
necessitated
the
suppression
of
numerous
court
offices
had
done
more
than
anything
else
to
increase
his
unpopularity
even
the
people
in
whose
behalf
these
sacrifices
were
made
looked
askance
at
his
diminished
state
and
showed
a
perverse
sympathy
with
the
dispossessed
officials
who
had
taken
so
picturesque
a
part
in
the
public
ceremonials
of
the
court
all
odo
philosophy
could
not
fortify
him
against
such
disillusionments
he
felt
the
lack
of
unquestioning
faith
not
only
in
the
abstract
beauty
of
the
new
ideals
but
in
their
immediate
adaptability
to
the
complex
conditions
of
life
only
a
woman
convictions
nourished
on
sentiment
and
could
burn
with
that
clear
unwavering
flame
his
own
beliefs
were
at
the
mercy
of
every
wind
of
doubt
or
ingratitude
that
blew
across
his
unsheltered
sensibilities
it
was
more
than
a
year
since
he
had
had
news
of
fulvia
for
a
while
they
had
exchanged
letters
and
it
had
been
a
consolation
to
tell
her
of
his
struggles
and
experiments
of
his
many
failures
and
few
results
she
had
encouraged
him
to
continue
the
struggle
had
analysed
his
various
plans
of
reform
and
had
given
her
enthusiastic
support
to
the
partitioning
of
the
bishop
fief
and
the
secularisation
of
the
university
her
own
life
she
said
was
too
uneventful
to
write
of
but
she
spoke
of
the
kindness
of
her
hosts
the
professor
and
his
wife
of
the
simple
unceremonious
way
of
living
in
the
old
calvinist
city
and
of
the
number
of
distinguished
persons
drawn
thither
by
its
atmosphere
of
intellectual
and
social
freedom
odo
suspected
a
certain
colourlessness
in
the
life
she
depicted
the
tone
of
her
letters
was
too
uniformly
cheerful
not
to
suggest
a
lack
of
emotional
variety
and
he
knew
that
fulvia
nature
however
much
she
fancied
it
under
the
rule
of
reason
was
in
reality
fed
by
profound
currents
of
feeling
something
of
her
old
ardour
reappeared
when
she
wrote
of
the
possibility
of
publishing
her
father
book
her
friends
in
geneva
having
heard
of
her
difficulty
with
the
dutch
publisher
had
undertaken
to
vindicate
her
claims
and
they
had
every
hope
that
the
matter
would
be
successfully
concluded
the
joy
of
renewed
activity
with
which
this
letter
glowed
would
have
communicated
itself
to
odo
had
he
received
it
at
a
different
time
but
it
came
on
the
day
of
his
marriage
and
since
then
he
had
never
written
to
her
now
he
felt
a
sudden
longing
to
break
the
silence
between
them
and
seating
himself
at
his
desk
he
began
to
write
a
moment
later
there
was
a
knock
on
the
door
and
one
of
his
gentlemen
entered
the
count
vittorio
alfieri
with
a
dozen
horses
and
as
many
servants
was
newly
arrived
at
the
golden
cross
and
desired
to
know
when
he
might
have
the
honour
of
waiting
on
his
highness
odo
felt
the
sudden
glow
of
pleasure
that
the
news
of
alfieri
coming
always
brought
here
was
a
friend
at
last
he
forgot
the
constraint
of
their
last
meeting
in
florence
and
remembered
only
the
happy
interchange
of
ideas
and
emotions
that
had
been
one
of
the
quickening
influences
of
his
youth
alfieri
in
the
intervening
years
was
grown
to
be
one
of
the
foremost
figures
in
italy
his
love
for
the
countess
of
albany
persisting
through
the
vicissitudes
of
her
tragic
marriage
had
rallied
the
scattered
forces
of
his
nature
ambitious
to
excel
for
her
sake
to
show
himself
worthy
of
such
a
love
he
had
at
last
shaken
off
the
strange
torpor
of
his
youth
and
revealed
himself
as
the
poet
for
whom
italy
waited
in
ten
months
of
feverish
effort
he
had
poured
forth
fourteen
tragedies
among
them
the
antigone
the
virginia
and
the
conjuration
of
the
pazzi
italy
started
up
at
the
sound
of
a
new
voice
vibrating
with
passions
she
had
long
since
unlearned
since
filicaja
thrilling
appeal
to
his
enslaved
country
no
poet
had
challenged
the
old
roman
spirit
which
petrarch
had
striven
to
rouse
while
the
literati
were
busy
discussing
alfieri
blank
verse
while
the
grammarians
wrangled
over
his
syntax
and
ridiculed
his
solecisms
the
public
heedless
of
such
niceties
was
glowing
with
the
new
wine
which
he
had
poured
into
the
old
vessels
of
classic
story
liberty
was
the
cry
that
rang
on
the
lips
of
all
his
heroes
in
accents
so
new
and
stirring
that
his
audience
never
wearied
of
its
repetition
it
was
no
secret
that
his
stories
of
ancient
greece
and
rome
were
but
allegories
meant
to
teach
the
love
of
freedom
yet
the
antigone
had
been
performed
in
the
private
theatre
of
the
spanish
ambassador
at
rome
the
virginia
had
been
received
with
applause
on
the
public
boards
at
turin
and
after
the
usual
difficulties
with
the
censorship
the
happy
author
had
actually
succeeded
in
publishing
his
plays
at
siena
these
volumes
were
already
in
odo
hands
and
a
manuscript
copy
of
the
odes
to
free
america
was
being
circulated
among
the
liberals
in
pianura
and
had
been
brought
to
his
notice
by
andreoni
to
those
hopeful
spirits
who
looked
for
the
near
approach
of
a
happier
era
alfieri
was
the
inspired
spokesman
of
reform
the
prophet
who
was
to
lead
his
country
out
of
bondage
the
eyes
of
the
italian
reformers
were
fixed
with
passionate
eagerness
on
the
course
of
events
in
england
and
france
the
conclusion
of
peace
between
england
and
america
recently
celebrated
in
alfieri
fifth
ode
seemed
to
the
most
sceptical
convincing
proof
that
the
rights
of
man
were
destined
to
a
speedy
triumph
throughout
the
civilised
world
it
was
not
of
a
united
italy
that
these
enthusiasts
dreamed
they
were
not
so
much
patriots
as
philanthropists
for
the
teachings
of
rousseau
and
his
school
while
intensifying
the
love
of
man
for
man
had
proportionately
weakened
the
sense
of
patriotism
of
the
interets
du
clocher
the
new
man
prided
himself
on
being
a
citizen
of
the
world
on
sympathising
as
warmly
with
the
poetic
savage
of
peru
as
with
his
own
prosaic
and
neighbours
indeed
the
prevalent
belief
that
the
savage
mode
of
life
was
much
nearer
the
truth
than
that
of
civilised
europeans
made
it
appear
superfluous
to
enter
into
the
grievances
and
difficulties
of
what
was
but
a
passing
phase
of
human
development
to
cast
off
clothes
and
codes
and
live
in
a
peaceful
socialism
under
the
amiable
reign
of
truth
and
nature
seemed
on
the
whole
much
easier
than
to
undertake
the
systematic
reform
of
existing
abuses
to
such
dreamers
whose
ideas
were
those
of
the
majority
of
intelligent
men
in
france
and
italy
alfieri
tirades
embodied
the
noblest
of
political
creeds
and
even
the
soberer
judgment
of
statesmen
and
men
of
affairs
was
captivated
by
the
grandeur
of
his
verse
and
the
heroic
audacity
of
his
theme
for
the
first
time
in
centuries
the
italian
muse
spoke
with
the
voice
of
a
man
and
every
man
heart
in
italy
sprang
up
at
the
call
in
the
midst
of
these
triumphs
fate
in
the
shape
of
cardinal
york
had
momentarily
separated
alfieri
from
his
mistress
despatching
the
countess
to
a
discreet
retreat
in
alsace
and
signifying
to
her
turbulent
adorer
that
he
was
not
to
follow
her
distracted
by
this
prohibition
alfieri
had
resumed
the
nomadic
habits
of
his
youth
now
wandering
from
one
italian
city
to
another
now
pushing
as
far
as
paris
which
he
hated
but
was
always
revisiting
now
dashing
across
the
channel
to
buy
thoroughbreds
in
england
for
his
passion
for
horses
was
unabated
he
was
lately
returned
from
such
an
expedition
having
led
his
cavalcade
across
the
alps
in
person
with
a
boyish
delight
in
the
astonishment
which
this
fantastic
exploit
excited
the
meeting
between
the
two
friends
was
all
that
odo
could
have
wished
though
affecting
to
scorn
the
courts
of
princes
alfieri
was
not
averse
to
showing
himself
there
as
the
poet
of
the
democracy
and
to
hearing
his
heroes
mouth
their
tyrannicidal
speeches
on
the
boards
of
royal
and
ducal
stages
he
had
lately
made
some
stay
in
milan
where
he
had
arrived
in
time
to
see
his
antigone
performed
before
the
court
and
to
be
enthusiastically
acclaimed
as
the
of
liberty
by
a
community
living
placidly
under
the
austrian
yoke
alfieri
was
not
the
man
to
be
struck
by
such
incongruities
it
was
his
fate
to
formulate
creeds
in
which
he
had
no
faith
to
recreate
the
political
ideals
of
italy
while
bitterly
opposed
to
any
actual
effort
at
reform
and
to
be
regarded
as
the
mouthpiece
of
the
revolution
while
he
execrated
the
revolution
with
the
whole
force
of
his
traditional
instincts
as
usual
he
was
too
deeply
engrossed
in
his
own
affairs
to
feel
much
interest
in
any
others
but
it
was
enough
for
odo
to
clasp
the
hand
of
the
man
who
had
given
a
voice
to
the
highest
aspirations
of
his
countrymen
the
poet
gave
more
than
he
could
expect
from
the
friend
and
he
was
satisfied
to
listen
to
alfieri
account
of
his
triumphs
interspersed
with
bitter
diatribes
against
the
public
whose
applause
he
courted
and
the
pope
to
whom
on
bended
knee
he
had
offered
a
copy
of
his
plays
odo
eagerly
pressed
alfieri
to
remain
in
pianura
offering
to
put
one
of
the
ducal
villas
at
his
disposal
and
suggesting
that
the
virginia
should
be
performed
before
the
court
on
the
duchess
birthday
it
is
true
he
said
that
we
can
offer
you
but
an
indifferent
company
of
actors
but
it
might
be
possible
to
obtain
one
or
two
of
the
leading
tragedians
from
turin
or
milan
so
that
the
principal
parts
should
at
least
be
worthily
filled
alfieri
replied
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
your
highness
our
leading
tragedians
are
monkeys
trained
to
dance
to
the
tune
of
goldoni
and
metastasio
the
best
are
no
better
than
the
worst
we
have
no
tragedians
in
italy
because
hitherto
we
have
had
no
tragic
dramatist
he
drew
himself
up
and
thrust
a
hand
in
his
bosom
ah
he
exclaimed
if
i
could
see
the
part
of
virginia
acted
by
the
lady
who
recently
recited
before
a
small
company
in
milan
my
odes
to
free
america
there
indeed
were
fire
sublimity
and
passion
and
the
countenance
had
not
lost
its
freshness
the
eye
its
lustre
but
he
suddenly
added
your
highness
knows
of
whom
i
speak
the
lady
is
fulvia
vivaldi
the
daughter
of
the
philosopher
at
whose
feet
we
sat
in
our
youth
fulvia
vivaldi
odo
raised
his
head
with
a
start
she
had
left
geneva
then
had
returned
to
italy
the
alps
no
longer
divided
them
a
scant
day
journey
would
bring
him
to
her
side
it
was
strange
how
the
mere
thought
seemed
to
fill
the
room
with
her
presence
he
felt
her
in
the
quickened
beat
of
his
pulses
in
the
sudden
lightness
of
the
air
in
a
lifting
and
widening
of
the
very
bounds
of
thought
from
alfieri
he
learned
that
she
had
lived
for
some
months
in
the
household
of
the
distinguished
naturalist
count
castiglione
with
whose
daughter
education
she
was
charged
in
such
surroundings
her
wit
and
learning
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
best
company
of
milan
and
she
was
become
one
of
the
most
noted
figures
of
the
capital
there
had
been
some
talk
of
offering
her
the
chair
of
poetry
at
the
brera
but
the
report
of
her
liberal
views
had
deterred
the
faculty
meanwhile
the
very
fact
that
she
represented
the
new
school
of
thought
gave
an
added
zest
to
her
conversation
in
a
society
which
made
up
for
its
mild
servitude
under
the
austrian
by
much
talk
of
liberalism
and
independence
the
signorina
vivaldi
became
the
fashion
the
literati
celebrated
her
scholarship
the
sonneteers
her
eloquence
and
beauty
and
no
foreigner
on
the
grand
tour
was
content
to
leave
milan
without
having
beheld
the
fair
prodigy
and
heard
her
recite
petrarch
ode
to
italy
or
the
latest
elegy
of
pindamonte
odo
scarce
knew
with
what
feelings
he
listened
he
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
such
a
life
was
better
suited
to
one
of
fulvia
gifts
and
ambitions
than
the
humdrum
existence
of
a
swiss
town
yet
his
first
sensation
was
one
of
obscure
jealousy
of
reluctance
to
think
of
her
as
having
definitely
broken
with
the
past
he
had
pictured
her
as
adrift
like
himself
on
a
dark
sea
of
uncertainties
and
to
learn
that
she
had
found
a
safe
anchorage
was
almost
to
feel
himself
deserted
the
court
was
soon
busy
with
preparations
for
the
coming
performance
a
celebrated
actress
from
venice
was
engaged
to
play
the
part
of
virginia
and
the
rehearsals
went
rapidly
forward
under
the
noble
supervision
at
last
the
great
day
arrived
and
for
the
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
little
theatre
operetta
and
pastoral
were
replaced
by
the
buskined
muse
of
tragedy
the
court
and
all
the
nobility
were
present
and
though
it
was
no
longer
thought
becoming
for
ecclesiastics
to
visit
the
theatre
the
bishop
appeared
in
a
in
company
with
his
chaplains
and
the
the
performance
was
brilliantly
successful
frantic
applause
greeted
the
tirades
of
the
young
icilius
every
outburst
against
the
abuse
of
privileges
and
the
insolence
of
the
patricians
was
acclaimed
by
ministers
and
courtiers
and
the
loudest
in
approval
were
the
marquess
pievepelago
the
recognised
representative
of
the
clericals
the
marchioness
of
boscofolto
whose
harsh
enforcement
of
her
feudal
rights
was
among
the
bitterest
grievances
of
the
peasantry
and
the
good
bishop
who
had
lately
roused
himself
from
his
habitual
indolence
to
oppose
the
threatened
annexation
of
the
caccia
del
vescovo
one
and
all
proclaimed
their
ardent
sympathy
with
the
proletariat
their
scorn
of
tyranny
and
extortion
in
high
places
and
if
the
marchioness
on
her
return
home
ordered
one
of
her
linkmen
to
be
flogged
for
having
trod
on
her
gown
if
pievepelago
the
next
morning
refused
to
give
audience
to
a
poor
devil
of
a
pamphleteer
that
was
come
to
ask
his
intercession
with
the
holy
office
if
the
bishop
at
the
same
moment
concluded
the
purchase
of
six
turks
from
the
galleys
of
his
serenity
the
doge
of
genoa
it
is
probable
that
like
the
illustrious
author
of
the
drama
all
were
unconscious
of
any
incongruity
between
their
sentiments
and
actions
as
to
odo
seated
in
the
state
box
with
maria
clementina
at
his
side
and
the
court
dignitaries
grouped
in
the
background
he
had
not
listened
to
a
dozen
lines
before
all
sense
of
his
surroundings
vanished
and
he
became
the
passive
instrument
on
which
the
poet
played
his
mighty
harmonies
all
the
incidental
difficulties
of
life
all
the
vacillations
of
an
unsatisfied
spirit
were
consumed
in
that
energising
emotion
which
seemed
to
leave
every
faculty
stripped
for
action
profounder
meaning
and
more
subtle
music
he
had
found
in
the
great
poets
of
the
past
but
here
was
an
appeal
to
the
immediate
needs
of
the
hour
uttered
in
notes
as
thrilling
as
a
and
brought
home
to
every
sense
by
the
vivid
imagery
of
the
stage
once
more
he
felt
the
old
ardour
of
belief
that
fulvia
nearness
had
fanned
in
him
his
convictions
had
flagged
rather
than
his
courage
now
they
started
up
as
at
her
summons
and
he
heard
the
ring
of
her
voice
in
every
line
he
left
the
theatre
still
vibrating
with
this
new
inrush
of
life
and
jealous
of
any
interruption
that
should
check
it
the
duchess
birthday
was
being
celebrated
by
illuminations
and
fireworks
and
throngs
of
filled
the
moonlit
streets
but
odo
after
appearing
for
a
moment
at
his
wife
side
on
the
balcony
above
the
public
square
withdrew
quietly
to
his
own
apartments
the
casement
of
his
closet
stood
wide
and
he
leaned
against
the
looking
out
on
the
silent
radiance
of
the
gardens
as
he
stood
there
he
saw
two
figures
flit
across
the
farther
end
of
one
of
the
long
alleys
the
moonlight
surrendered
them
for
a
moment
the
shade
almost
instantly
reclaiming
them
strayed
revellers
doubtless
escaping
from
the
lights
and
music
of
the
duchess
circle
a
knock
roused
the
duke
and
he
remembered
that
he
had
bidden
gamba
wait
on
him
after
the
performance
he
had
been
curious
to
hear
what
impression
alfieri
drama
had
produced
upon
the
hunchback
but
now
any
interruption
seemed
unwelcome
and
he
turned
to
gamba
with
a
gesture
of
dismissal
the
latter
however
remained
on
the
threshold
your
highness
he
said
the
bookseller
andreoni
craves
the
privilege
of
an
audience
andreoni
at
this
hour
for
reasons
so
urgent
that
he
makes
no
doubt
of
your
consent
and
to
prove
his
good
faith
and
the
need
of
presenting
himself
at
so
undue
an
hour
and
in
this
private
manner
he
charged
me
to
give
this
to
your
highness
he
laid
in
the
duke
hand
a
small
object
in
blackened
silver
which
on
nearer
inspection
proved
to
be
the
ducal
odo
stood
gazing
fixedly
at
this
mysterious
token
which
seemed
to
come
as
an
answer
to
his
inmost
thoughts
his
heart
beat
high
with
confused
hopes
and
fears
and
he
could
hardly
control
the
voice
in
which
he
answered
bid
andreoni
come
to
me
the
bookseller
began
by
excusing
himself
for
the
liberty
he
had
taken
he
explained
that
the
signorina
fulvia
vivaldi
in
whose
behalf
he
came
was
in
urgent
need
of
aid
and
had
begged
him
to
wait
on
the
duke
as
soon
as
the
court
had
risen
from
the
play
she
is
in
pianura
then
odo
exclaimed
since
yesterday
your
highness
three
days
since
she
was
ordered
by
the
police
to
leave
milan
within
hours
and
she
came
at
once
to
pianura
knowing
that
my
wife
and
i
would
gladly
receive
her
but
today
we
learned
that
the
holy
office
was
advised
of
her
presence
here
and
of
the
reason
of
her
banishment
from
lombardy
and
this
fresh
danger
has
forced
her
to
implore
your
highness
protection
andreoni
went
on
to
explain
that
the
publication
of
her
father
book
was
the
immediate
cause
of
fulvia
persecution
the
origin
of
civilisation
which
had
been
printed
some
months
previously
in
amsterdam
had
stirred
italy
more
profoundly
than
any
book
since
beccaria
great
work
on
crime
and
punishment
the
author
historical
investigations
were
but
a
pretext
for
the
development
of
his
political
theories
which
were
set
forth
with
singular
daring
and
audacity
and
supported
by
all
the
arguments
that
his
long
study
of
the
past
commanded
the
temperate
and
judicial
tone
which
he
had
succeeded
in
preserving
enhanced
the
effect
of
his
arraignment
of
church
and
state
and
while
his
immense
erudition
commended
his
work
to
the
learned
its
directness
of
style
gave
it
an
immediate
popularity
with
the
general
reader
it
was
an
age
when
every
book
or
pamphlet
bearing
on
the
great
question
of
personal
liberty
was
eagerly
devoured
by
an
insatiable
public
and
a
few
weeks
after
vivaldi
volume
had
been
smuggled
into
italy
it
was
the
talk
of
every
club
and
from
calabria
to
piedmont
the
inevitable
result
soon
followed
the
holy
office
got
wind
of
the
business
and
the
book
was
at
once
put
on
the
index
in
naples
and
bologna
it
was
publicly
burned
and
in
modena
a
professor
of
the
university
who
was
found
to
have
a
copy
in
his
possession
was
fined
and
removed
from
his
chair
in
milan
where
the
strong
liberal
faction
among
the
nobility
and
the
comparative
leniency
of
the
austrian
rule
permitted
a
more
unrestrained
discussion
of
political
questions
the
origin
of
civilisation
was
received
with
open
enthusiasm
and
the
story
of
the
difficulties
that
fulvia
had
encountered
in
its
publication
made
her
the
heroine
of
the
moment
she
had
never
concealed
her
devotion
to
her
father
doctrines
and
in
the
first
glow
of
filial
pride
she
may
have
yielded
too
openly
to
the
desire
to
propagate
them
certain
it
is
that
she
began
to
be
looked
on
as
having
shared
in
the
writing
of
the
book
or
as
being
at
least
an
active
exponent
of
its
principles
even
in
lombardy
it
was
not
well
to
be
too
openly
associated
with
the
authorship
of
a
condemned
book
and
fulvia
was
suddenly
advised
by
the
police
that
her
presence
in
milan
was
no
longer
acceptable
to
the
government
the
news
excited
great
indignation
among
her
friends
and
count
castiglione
and
several
other
gentlemen
of
rank
hastened
to
intervene
in
her
behalf
but
the
governor
declared
himself
unwilling
to
take
issue
with
the
holy
office
on
a
doctrinal
point
and
privately
added
that
it
would
be
well
for
the
signorina
vivaldi
to
withdraw
from
lombardy
before
the
clergy
brought
any
direct
charge
against
her
to
ignore
this
hint
would
have
been
to
risk
not
only
her
own
safety
but
that
of
the
gentlemen
who
had
befriended
her
and
fulvia
at
once
set
out
for
pianura
the
only
place
in
italy
where
she
could
count
on
friendship
and
protection
andreoni
and
his
wife
would
gladly
have
given
her
a
home
but
on
learning
that
the
holy
office
was
on
her
track
she
had
refused
to
compromise
them
by
remaining
under
their
roof
and
had
insisted
that
andreoni
should
wait
on
the
duke
and
obtain
a
for
her
that
very
night
odo
listened
to
this
story
with
an
agitation
compounded
of
strangely
contradictory
sensations
to
learn
that
fulvia
at
the
very
moment
when
he
had
pictured
her
as
separated
from
him
by
the
happiness
and
security
of
her
life
was
in
reality
a
proscribed
wanderer
with
none
but
himself
to
turn
to
filled
him
with
a
confused
sense
of
happiness
but
the
discovery
that
in
his
own
dominions
the
political
refugee
was
not
safe
from
the
threats
of
the
holy
office
excited
a
different
emotion
all
these
considerations
however
were
subordinate
to
the
thought
that
he
must
see
fulvia
at
once
it
was
impossible
to
summon
her
to
the
palace
at
that
hour
or
even
to
secure
her
safety
till
morning
without
compromising
andreoni
by
calling
attention
to
the
fact
that
a
suspected
person
was
under
his
roof
and
for
a
moment
odo
was
at
a
loss
how
to
detain
her
in
pianura
without
seeming
to
go
counter
to
her
wishes
suddenly
he
remembered
that
gamba
was
fertile
in
expedients
and
calling
in
the
hunchback
asked
what
plan
he
could
devise
gamba
after
a
moment
reflection
drew
a
key
from
his
pocket
may
it
please
your
highness
he
said
this
unlocks
the
door
of
the
at
pontesordo
the
place
has
been
deserted
these
many
years
because
of
its
bad
name
and
i
have
more
than
once
found
it
a
convenient
shelter
when
i
had
reasons
for
wishing
to
be
private
at
this
season
there
is
no
fear
of
poison
from
the
marshes
and
if
your
highness
desires
i
will
see
that
the
lady
finds
her
way
there
before
sunrise
the
sun
had
hardly
risen
the
next
morning
when
the
duke
himself
set
forth
he
rode
alone
dressed
like
one
of
his
own
esquires
and
gave
the
word
unremarked
to
the
sleepy
sentinel
at
the
gate
as
it
closed
behind
him
and
he
set
out
down
the
long
road
that
led
to
the
chase
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
morning
solitude
was
thronged
with
spectral
memories
melancholy
and
fanciful
they
flitted
before
him
now
in
the
guise
of
cerveno
and
momola
now
of
maria
clementina
and
himself
every
detail
of
the
scene
was
interwoven
with
the
fibres
of
early
association
from
the
far
off
years
when
as
a
lonely
child
on
the
farm
at
pontesordo
he
had
gazed
across
the
marsh
at
the
mysterious
woodlands
of
the
chase
to
the
later
day
when
in
the
deserted
the
duchess
had
flung
her
whip
at
the
face
in
the
venice
mirror
he
pressed
forward
impatiently
and
presently
the
lodge
rose
before
him
in
its
grassy
solitude
the
level
sunbeams
had
not
yet
penetrated
the
surrounding
palisade
of
boughs
and
the
house
lay
in
a
chill
twilight
that
seemed
an
emanation
from
its
mouldering
walls
as
odo
approached
gamba
appeared
from
the
shadow
and
took
his
horse
and
the
next
moment
he
had
pushed
open
the
door
and
stood
in
fulvia
presence
she
was
seated
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
and
as
she
rose
to
meet
him
it
chanced
that
her
head
enveloped
in
its
black
was
relieved
for
a
moment
against
the
tarnished
background
of
the
broken
mirror
the
impression
struck
a
chill
to
his
heart
but
it
was
replaced
by
a
glow
of
boyish
happiness
as
their
eyes
met
and
he
felt
her
hands
in
his
for
a
moment
all
his
thoughts
were
lost
in
the
mere
sense
of
her
nearness
she
seemed
simply
an
enveloping
atmosphere
in
which
he
drew
fresh
breath
but
gradually
her
outline
emerged
from
this
haze
of
feeling
and
he
found
himself
looking
at
her
with
the
wondering
gaze
of
a
stranger
she
had
been
a
girl
of
sixteen
when
they
first
met
twelve
years
had
passed
since
then
and
she
was
now
a
woman
of
belonging
to
a
race
in
which
beauty
ripens
early
and
as
soon
declines
but
some
happy
property
of
nature
whether
the
rare
mould
of
her
features
or
the
gift
of
the
spirit
that
informed
them
had
held
her
loveliness
intact
preserving
the
clear
lines
of
youth
after
its
bloom
was
gone
and
making
her
seem
like
a
lover
memory
of
herself
so
she
appeared
at
first
a
bright
imponderable
presence
gliding
toward
him
out
of
the
past
but
as
her
hands
lay
in
his
the
warm
current
of
life
was
renewed
between
them
and
the
woman
dispossessed
the
shade
unpublished
fragment
from
arthur
young
diary
of
his
travels
in
italy
in
the
year
october
having
agreed
with
a
vetturino
to
carry
me
to
pianura
set
out
this
morning
from
mantua
the
country
mostly
arable
with
rows
of
elm
and
maple
pollard
dined
at
casal
maggiore
in
an
infamous
filthy
inn
at
dinner
was
joined
by
a
gentleman
who
had
taken
the
other
seat
in
the
vettura
as
far
as
pianura
we
engaged
in
conversation
and
i
found
him
a
man
of
lively
intelligence
and
the
most
polished
address
though
dressed
in
the
foreign
style
en
abbe
he
spoke
english
with
as
much
fluency
as
myself
and
but
for
the
philosophical
tone
of
his
remarks
i
had
taken
him
for
an
ecclesiastic
altogether
a
striking
and
somewhat
perplexing
character
able
keen
intelligent
evidently
used
to
the
best
company
yet
acquainted
with
the
condition
of
the
people
the
methods
of
farming
and
other
economical
subjects
such
as
are
seldom
thought
worthy
of
attention
among
italians
of
quality
it
appeared
he
was
newly
from
france
where
he
had
been
as
much
struck
as
myself
by
the
general
state
of
ferment
though
owning
that
there
was
much
reason
for
discontent
and
that
the
conduct
of
the
court
and
ministers
was
blind
and
infatuated
beyond
belief
he
yet
declared
himself
gravely
apprehensive
of
the
future
saying
that
the
people
knew
not
what
they
wanted
and
were
unwilling
to
listen
to
those
that
might
have
proved
their
best
advisors
whether
by
this
he
meant
the
clergy
i
know
not
though
i
observed
he
spoke
favourably
of
that
body
in
france
pointing
out
that
long
before
the
recent
agitations
they
had
defended
the
civil
rights
of
the
third
estate
and
citing
many
cases
in
which
the
country
curates
had
shown
themselves
the
truest
friends
of
the
people
a
fact
my
own
observation
hath
confirmed
i
remarked
to
him
that
i
was
surprised
to
find
how
little
talk
there
was
in
italy
of
the
distracted
conditions
in
france
and
this
though
the
country
is
overrun
with
french
refugees
or
emigres
as
they
call
themselves
who
bring
with
them
reports
that
might
well
excite
the
alarm
of
neighbouring
governments
he
said
he
had
remarked
the
same
indifference
but
that
this
was
consonant
with
the
italian
character
which
never
looked
to
the
morrow
and
he
added
that
the
mild
disposition
of
the
people
and
their
profound
respect
for
religion
were
sufficient
assurance
against
any
political
excess
to
this
i
could
not
forbear
replying
that
i
could
not
regard
as
excesses
the
just
protests
of
the
poor
against
the
unlawful
tyranny
of
the
privileged
classes
nor
forbear
to
hail
with
joy
the
dawn
of
that
light
of
freedom
which
hath
already
shed
so
sublime
an
effulgence
on
the
wilds
of
the
new
world
the
abate
took
this
in
good
part
though
i
could
see
he
was
not
wholly
of
my
way
of
thinking
but
he
declared
that
in
his
opinion
different
races
needed
different
laws
and
that
the
sturdy
and
temperate
american
colonists
were
fitted
to
enjoy
a
greater
measure
of
political
freedom
than
the
more
volatile
french
and
italians
as
though
liberty
were
not
destined
by
the
creator
to
be
equally
shared
by
all
mankind
footnote
i
let
this
passage
stand
though
the
late
unhappy
events
in
france
have
alas
proved
that
my
friend
the
abate
was
nearer
right
than
myself
june
in
the
afternoon
through
a
poor
country
to
ponte
di
po
a
miserable
village
on
the
borders
of
the
duchy
where
we
lay
not
slept
in
our
clothes
at
the
worst
inn
i
have
yet
encountered
here
our
luggage
was
plumbed
for
pianura
the
impertinence
of
the
petty
sovereigns
to
travellers
in
italy
is
often
intolerable
and
the
customs
officers
show
the
utmost
insolence
in
the
search
for
seditious
pamphlets
and
other
contraband
articles
but
here
i
was
agreeably
surprised
by
the
courtesy
of
the
officials
and
the
despatch
with
which
our
luggage
was
examined
on
my
remarking
this
my
companion
replied
that
the
duke
of
pianura
was
a
man
of
liberal
views
anxious
to
encourage
foreigners
to
visit
his
state
and
the
last
to
put
petty
obstacles
in
the
way
of
travel
i
answered
this
was
the
report
i
had
heard
of
him
and
it
was
in
the
hope
of
learning
something
more
of
the
reforms
he
was
said
to
have
effected
that
i
had
turned
aside
to
visit
the
duchy
my
companion
replied
that
his
highness
had
in
fact
introduced
some
innovations
in
the
government
but
that
changes
which
seemed
the
most
beneficial
in
one
direction
often
worked
mischief
in
another
so
that
the
wisest
ruler
was
perhaps
not
he
that
did
the
greatest
amount
of
good
but
he
that
was
cause
of
the
fewest
evils
the
from
ponte
di
po
to
pianura
the
most
convenient
way
is
by
water
but
the
river
piana
being
greatly
swollen
by
the
late
rains
my
friend
who
seems
with
the
country
proposed
driving
thither
a
suggestion
i
readily
accepted
as
it
gave
me
a
good
opportunity
to
study
the
roads
and
farms
of
the
duchy
crossing
the
piana
drove
near
four
hours
over
horrible
roads
across
waste
land
thinly
wooded
without
houses
or
cultivation
on
my
expressing
surprise
that
the
territory
of
so
enlightened
a
prince
would
lie
thus
neglected
the
abate
said
this
land
was
a
fief
of
the
see
of
pianura
and
that
the
duke
was
desirous
of
annexing
it
to
the
duchy
i
asked
if
it
were
true
that
his
highness
had
given
his
people
a
constitution
modelled
on
that
of
the
duke
of
tuscany
he
said
he
had
heard
the
report
but
that
for
his
part
he
must
deplore
any
measure
tending
to
debar
the
clergy
from
the
possession
of
land
seeing
my
surprise
he
explained
that
in
italy
at
least
the
religious
orders
were
far
better
landlords
than
the
great
nobles
or
the
petty
sovereigns
who
being
for
the
most
part
absent
from
their
estates
left
their
peasantry
to
be
pillaged
by
rapacious
middlemen
and
stewards
an
argument
i
have
heard
advanced
by
other
travellers
and
have
myself
had
frequent
occasion
to
corroborate
on
leaving
the
bishop
domain
remarked
an
improvement
in
the
roads
flat
land
well
irrigated
and
divided
as
usual
into
small
holdings
the
pernicious
metayer
system
exists
everywhere
but
i
am
told
the
duke
is
opposed
to
it
though
it
is
upheld
not
only
by
the
landed
class
but
by
the
numerous
economists
that
write
on
agriculture
from
their
closets
but
would
doubtless
be
sorely
puzzled
to
distinguish
a
from
a
turnip
the
set
out
early
to
visit
pianura
the
city
clean
and
the
duke
has
introduced
such
as
are
used
in
turin
and
the
pavement
is
remarkably
fair
and
even
few
beggars
are
to
be
seen
and
the
people
have
a
thriving
look
visited
the
cathedral
and
baptistery
in
the
gothic
style
more
curious
than
beautiful
also
the
duke
picture
gallery
learning
that
the
duchess
was
to
ride
out
in
the
afternoon
had
the
curiosity
to
walk
abroad
to
see
her
a
good
view
of
her
as
she
left
the
palace
though
no
longer
in
her
first
youth
she
is
one
of
the
handsomest
women
i
have
seen
remarked
a
decided
likeness
to
the
queen
of
france
though
the
eye
and
smile
are
less
engaging
the
people
in
the
streets
received
her
sullenly
and
i
am
told
her
debts
and
disorders
are
the
scandal
of
the
town
she
has
of
course
her
cicisbeo
and
the
duke
is
the
devoted
slave
of
a
learned
lady
who
is
said
to
exert
an
unlimited
influence
over
him
and
to
have
done
much
to
better
the
condition
of
the
people
a
new
part
for
a
prince
mistress
to
play
in
the
evening
to
the
theatre
a
handsome
building
with
wax
where
cimarosa
due
baroni
was
agreeably
sung
the
my
lord
hervey
in
florence
having
favoured
me
with
a
letter
to
count
trescorre
the
duke
prime
minister
i
waited
on
that
gentleman
yesterday
his
excellency
received
me
politely
and
assured
me
that
he
knew
me
by
reputation
and
would
do
all
he
could
to
put
me
in
the
way
of
investigating
the
agricultural
conditions
of
the
duchy
contrary
to
the
italian
custom
he
invited
me
to
dine
with
him
the
next
day
as
a
rule
these
great
nobles
do
not
open
their
doors
to
foreigners
however
well
recommended
visited
by
appointment
the
press
of
the
celebrated
andreoni
who
was
banished
during
the
late
duke
reign
for
suspected
liberal
tendencies
but
is
now
restored
to
favour
and
placed
at
the
head
of
the
royal
typography
signor
andreoni
received
me
with
every
mark
of
esteem
and
after
having
shown
me
some
of
the
finest
examples
of
his
work
such
as
the
pindar
the
lucretius
and
the
dante
accompanied
me
to
a
neighbouring
where
i
was
introduced
to
several
lovers
of
agriculture
here
i
learned
some
particulars
of
the
duke
attempted
reforms
he
has
undertaken
the
work
of
draining
the
vast
marsh
of
pontesordo
to
the
west
of
the
city
notorious
for
its
has
renounced
the
monopoly
of
corn
and
tobacco
has
taken
the
university
out
of
the
hands
of
the
barnabites
and
introduced
the
teaching
of
the
physical
sciences
formerly
prohibited
by
the
church
has
spent
since
his
accession
near
liv
on
improving
the
roads
throughout
the
duchy
and
is
now
engaged
in
framing
a
constitution
which
shall
deprive
the
clergy
of
the
greatest
part
of
their
privileges
and
confirm
the
sovereign
right
to
annex
ecclesiastical
territory
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
in
spite
of
these
radical
measures
his
highness
is
not
popular
with
the
masses
he
is
accused
of
irreligion
by
the
monks
that
he
has
removed
from
the
university
and
his
mistress
the
daughter
of
a
noted
who
was
driven
from
piedmont
by
the
inquisition
is
said
to
have
an
unholy
influence
over
him
i
am
told
these
rumours
are
diligently
fomented
by
the
late
duke
minister
now
prior
of
the
dominican
monastery
a
man
of
bigoted
views
but
great
astuteness
the
truth
is
the
people
are
so
completely
under
the
influence
of
the
friars
that
a
word
is
enough
to
turn
them
against
their
truest
benefactors
in
the
afternoon
i
was
setting
out
to
visit
the
bishop
gallery
when
count
trescorre
secretary
waited
on
me
with
an
invitation
to
inspect
the
estates
of
the
marchioness
of
boscofolto
an
offer
i
readily
accepted
for
what
are
the
masterpieces
of
raphael
or
cleomenes
to
the
sight
of
a
good
turnip
field
or
of
a
dairy
i
had
heard
of
boscofolto
which
was
given
by
the
late
duke
to
his
mistress
as
one
of
the
most
productive
estates
of
the
duchy
but
great
was
my
disappointment
on
beholding
it
fine
gardens
there
are
to
be
sure
clipt
walks
leaden
statues
and
but
as
for
the
farms
all
is
dirt
neglect
disorder
spite
of
the
lady
wealth
all
are
let
out
alla
meta
and
farmed
on
principles
that
would
disgrace
a
savage
the
spade
used
instead
of
the
plough
the
hedges
neglected
in
the
pastures
good
land
run
to
waste
the
peasants
starving
and
indebted
where
with
a
little
thrift
and
humanity
all
had
been
smiling
plenty
learned
that
on
the
owner
death
this
great
property
reverts
to
the
barnabites
from
boscofolto
to
the
church
of
the
madonna
del
monte
where
is
one
of
their
images
said
to
be
annually
visited
by
close
on
thirty
thousand
pilgrims
but
there
is
always
some
exaggeration
in
such
figures
a
fine
building
richly
adorned
and
hung
with
an
extraordinary
number
of
votive
offerings
silver
arms
legs
hearts
wax
images
and
paintings
some
of
these
latter
are
clearly
the
work
of
village
artists
and
depict
the
miraculous
escape
of
the
peasantry
from
various
calamities
and
the
preservation
of
their
crops
from
floods
drought
lightning
and
so
forth
these
poor
wretches
had
done
more
to
better
their
crops
by
spending
their
savings
in
good
ploughshares
and
harrows
than
by
hanging
on
a
wooden
idol
the
rector
received
us
civilly
and
showed
us
the
treasury
full
of
jewels
and
costly
plate
and
the
buildings
where
the
pilgrims
are
lodged
learned
that
the
giubileo
or
centenary
festival
of
the
madonna
is
shortly
to
be
celebrated
with
great
pomp
the
poorer
classes
delight
in
these
ceremonies
and
i
am
told
this
is
to
surpass
all
previous
ones
the
clergy
intending
to
work
on
the
superstitions
of
the
people
and
thus
turn
them
against
the
new
charter
it
is
said
the
duke
hopes
to
counteract
these
designs
by
offering
a
jewelled
diadem
to
the
virgin
but
this
will
no
doubt
do
him
a
bad
turn
with
the
esprits
libres
these
little
states
are
as
full
of
intrigues
as
a
foul
fruit
of
maggots
the
to
dinner
at
count
trescorre
where
as
usual
i
was
the
man
in
the
company
have
long
since
ceased
to
be
concerned
by
this
why
should
a
mere
english
farmer
compete
in
elegance
with
these
monsignori
and
illustrissimi
surprised
to
find
among
the
company
my
of
the
other
day
learned
that
he
is
the
abate
de
crucis
a
personal
friend
of
the
duke
he
greeted
me
cordially
and
on
hearing
my
name
said
that
he
was
acquainted
with
my
works
in
the
translation
of
mons
freville
and
now
understood
how
it
was
that
i
had
got
the
better
of
him
in
our
farming
disputations
on
the
way
hither
was
surprised
to
be
told
by
count
trescorre
that
the
duke
desired
me
to
wait
on
him
that
evening
though
in
general
not
ambitious
of
such
honours
yet
in
this
case
nothing
could
be
more
gratifying
the
yesterday
evening
to
the
palace
where
his
highness
received
me
with
great
affability
he
was
in
his
private
apartments
with
the
abate
de
crucis
and
several
other
learned
men
among
them
the
famous
abate
crescenti
librarian
to
his
highness
and
author
of
the
celebrated
chronicles
of
the
italian
states
happy
indeed
is
the
prince
who
surrounds
himself
with
scholars
instead
of
courtiers
yet
i
can
not
say
that
the
impression
his
highness
produced
on
me
was
one
of
happiness
his
countenance
is
sad
almost
careworn
though
with
a
smile
of
engaging
sweetness
his
manner
affable
without
condescension
and
open
without
familiarity
i
am
told
he
is
oppressed
by
the
cares
of
his
station
and
from
a
certain
irresolution
of
voice
and
eye
that
bespeaks
not
so
much
weakness
as
a
speculative
cast
of
mind
i
can
believe
him
less
fitted
for
active
government
than
for
the
meditations
of
the
closet
he
appears
however
zealous
to
perform
his
duties
questioned
me
eagerly
about
my
impressions
of
italy
and
showed
a
flattering
familiarity
with
my
works
and
a
desire
to
profit
by
what
he
was
pleased
to
call
my
exceptional
knowledge
of
agriculture
i
thought
i
perceived
in
him
a
sincere
wish
to
study
the
welfare
of
his
people
but
was
disappointed
to
find
among
his
chosen
associates
not
one
practical
farmer
or
economist
but
only
the
usual
that
are
too
busy
planning
utopias
to
think
of
planting
turnips
the
visited
his
highness
estate
at
valsecca
here
he
has
converted
a
handsome
seat
into
a
school
of
agriculture
tearing
down
an
immense
orangery
to
plant
mulberries
and
replacing
costly
gardens
and
statuary
by
fields
a
good
example
to
his
wealthy
subjects
unfortunately
his
bailiff
is
not
what
we
should
call
a
practical
farmer
and
many
acres
of
valuable
ground
are
given
up
to
a
botanic
garden
where
exotic
plants
are
grown
at
great
expense
and
rather
for
curiosity
than
use
a
common
error
of
noble
agriculturists
in
the
afternoon
with
the
abate
de
crucis
to
the
benedictine
monastery
a
league
beyond
the
city
here
i
saw
the
best
farming
in
the
duchy
the
prior
received
us
politely
and
conversed
with
intelligence
on
drainage
crops
and
irrigation
i
urged
on
him
the
cultivation
of
turnips
and
he
appeared
struck
by
my
arguments
the
tenants
on
this
great
estate
appeared
better
housed
and
fed
than
any
i
have
seen
in
pianura
the
monks
have
a
school
of
agriculture
less
pretentious
but
than
the
duke
some
of
them
study
physics
and
chemistry
and
there
are
good
chirurgeons
among
them
who
care
for
the
poor
without
pay
the
aged
and
infirm
peasants
are
housed
in
a
neat
almshouse
and
the
sick
nursed
in
a
clean
lazaret
altogether
an
agreeable
picture
of
rural
prosperity
though
i
had
rather
it
had
been
the
result
of
free
labour
than
of
monastic
bounty
the
by
appointment
to
the
duke
egeria
this
lady
the
signorina
having
heard
that
i
was
in
pianura
had
desired
the
signor
andreoni
to
bring
me
to
her
i
had
expected
a
female
of
the
loud
declamatory
type
something
of
the
corilla
olimpica
order
but
in
this
was
agreeably
disappointed
the
signorina
is
modestly
lodged
lives
in
the
frugal
style
of
the
middle
class
and
refuses
to
accept
a
title
though
she
is
thus
debarred
from
going
to
court
were
it
not
indiscreet
to
speculate
on
a
lady
age
i
should
put
hers
at
somewhat
above
thirty
though
without
the
commanding
elegance
she
has
i
believe
more
beauty
of
a
quiet
sort
a
countenance
at
once
soft
and
animated
agreeably
tinged
with
melancholy
yet
lit
up
by
the
incessant
play
of
thought
and
emotion
that
succeed
each
other
in
her
talk
better
conversation
i
never
heard
and
can
heartily
confirm
the
assurances
of
those
who
had
told
me
that
the
lady
was
as
agreeable
in
discourse
as
learned
in
the
closet
footnote
it
has
before
now
been
observed
that
the
free
and
volatile
manners
of
foreign
ladies
tend
to
blind
the
english
traveller
to
the
inferiority
of
their
physical
charms
note
by
a
female
friend
of
the
author
on
entering
found
a
numerous
company
assembled
to
compliment
my
hostess
on
her
recent
appointment
as
doctor
of
the
university
this
is
an
honour
not
uncommonly
conferred
in
italy
where
female
learning
perhaps
from
its
rarity
is
highly
esteemed
but
i
am
told
the
ladies
thus
distinguished
seldom
speak
in
public
though
their
degree
entitles
them
to
a
chair
in
the
university
in
the
signorina
society
i
found
the
most
advanced
reformers
of
the
duchy
among
others
signor
gamba
the
famous
pamphleteer
author
of
a
remarkable
treatise
on
taxation
which
had
nearly
cost
him
his
liberty
under
the
late
duke
reign
he
is
a
man
of
extreme
views
and
sarcastic
tongue
with
an
irritability
of
manner
that
is
perhaps
the
result
of
bodily
infirmities
his
ideas
i
am
told
have
much
weight
with
the
fair
doctoress
and
in
the
lampoons
of
the
day
the
new
constitution
is
said
to
be
the
offspring
of
their
amours
and
to
have
inherited
its
father
deformity
the
company
presently
withdrawing
my
hostess
pressed
me
to
remain
she
was
eager
for
news
from
france
spoke
admiringly
of
the
new
constitution
and
recited
in
a
moving
manner
an
ode
of
her
own
composition
on
the
fall
of
the
bastille
though
living
so
retired
she
makes
no
secret
of
her
connection
with
the
duke
said
he
had
told
her
of
his
conversation
with
me
and
asked
what
i
thought
of
his
plan
for
draining
the
marsh
of
pontesordo
on
my
attempting
to
reply
to
this
in
detail
i
saw
that
like
some
of
the
most
accomplished
of
her
sex
she
was
impatient
of
minutiae
and
preferred
general
ideas
to
particular
instances
but
when
the
talk
turned
on
the
rights
of
the
people
i
was
struck
by
the
energy
and
justice
of
her
remarks
and
by
a
tone
of
resolution
and
courage
that
made
me
to
say
to
myself
here
is
the
hand
that
rules
the
state
she
questioned
me
earnestly
about
the
state
of
affairs
in
france
begged
me
to
lend
her
what
pamphlets
i
could
procure
and
while
making
no
secret
of
her
republican
sympathies
expressed
herself
with
a
moderation
not
always
found
in
her
sex
of
the
clergy
alone
she
appeared
intolerant
a
fact
hardly
to
be
wondered
at
considering
the
persecution
to
which
she
and
her
father
have
been
subjected
she
detained
me
near
two
hours
in
such
discourse
and
on
my
taking
leave
asked
with
some
show
of
feeling
what
i
as
a
practical
economist
would
advise
the
duke
to
do
for
the
benefit
of
his
people
to
which
i
replied
plant
turnips
madam
and
she
laughed
heartily
and
said
no
doubt
i
was
right
but
i
fear
all
the
heads
here
are
too
full
of
fine
theories
to
condescend
to
such
simple
improvements
fulvia
in
the
twilight
sat
awaiting
the
duke
the
room
in
which
she
sat
looked
out
on
a
cloister
enclosing
a
plot
of
ground
planted
with
yews
and
at
the
farther
end
of
this
cloister
a
door
communicated
by
a
covered
way
with
the
ducal
gardens
the
house
had
formed
a
part
of
the
convent
of
the
perpetual
adoration
which
had
been
sold
by
the
nuns
when
they
moved
to
the
new
buildings
the
late
duke
had
given
them
a
portion
had
been
torn
down
to
make
way
for
the
marquess
of
cerveno
palace
and
in
the
remaining
fragment
a
low
building
wedged
between
high
walls
fulvia
had
found
a
lodging
her
whole
dwelling
consisted
of
the
abbess
parlour
in
which
she
now
sat
and
the
two
or
three
adjoining
cells
the
tall
presses
in
the
parlour
had
been
filled
with
her
father
books
and
surmounted
by
his
globes
and
other
scientific
instruments
but
for
this
the
apartment
remained
as
unadorned
as
in
her
predecessor
day
and
fulvia
in
her
austere
black
gown
with
a
lawn
kerchief
folded
over
her
breast
and
the
unpowdered
hair
drawn
back
from
her
pale
face
might
herself
have
passed
for
the
head
of
a
religious
community
she
cultivated
with
almost
morbid
care
this
severity
of
dress
and
surroundings
there
were
moments
when
she
could
hardly
tolerate
the
pale
autumnal
beauty
which
her
glass
reflected
when
even
this
phantom
of
youth
and
radiance
became
a
to
her
spiritual
pride
she
was
not
ashamed
of
being
the
duke
of
pianura
mistress
but
she
had
a
horror
of
being
thought
like
the
mistresses
of
other
princes
she
loathed
all
that
the
position
represented
in
men
minds
she
had
refused
all
that
according
to
the
conventions
of
the
day
it
entitled
her
to
claim
wealth
patronage
and
the
rank
and
estates
which
it
was
customary
for
the
sovereign
to
confer
she
had
taken
nothing
from
odo
but
his
love
and
the
little
house
in
which
he
had
lodged
her
three
years
had
passed
since
fulvia
flight
to
pianura
from
the
moment
when
she
and
odo
had
stood
face
to
face
again
it
had
been
clear
to
him
that
he
could
never
give
her
up
to
her
that
she
could
never
leave
him
fate
seemed
to
have
thrown
them
together
in
derision
of
their
long
struggle
and
both
felt
that
lassitude
of
the
will
which
is
the
reaction
from
vain
endeavour
the
discovery
that
he
needed
her
that
the
task
for
which
he
had
given
her
up
could
after
all
not
be
accomplished
without
her
served
to
overcome
her
last
resistance
if
the
end
for
which
both
strove
could
best
be
attained
together
if
he
needed
the
aid
of
her
unfaltering
faith
as
much
as
she
needed
that
of
his
wealth
and
power
why
should
any
personal
scruple
stand
between
them
why
should
she
who
had
given
all
else
to
the
cause
ease
fortune
safety
and
even
the
happiness
that
lay
in
her
hand
hesitate
to
make
the
final
sacrifice
of
a
private
ideal
according
to
the
standards
of
her
day
there
was
no
dishonour
to
a
woman
in
being
the
mistress
of
a
man
whose
rank
forbade
his
marrying
her
the
dishonour
lay
in
the
conduct
which
had
come
to
be
associated
with
such
relations
under
the
old
dispensation
the
influence
of
the
prince
mistress
had
stood
for
the
last
excesses
of
moral
and
political
corruption
why
might
it
not
under
the
new
law
come
to
represent
as
unlimited
a
power
for
good
so
love
the
casuist
argued
and
during
those
first
months
when
happiness
seemed
at
last
its
own
justification
fulvia
lived
in
every
fibre
but
always
even
then
she
was
on
the
defensive
against
that
higher
tribunal
which
her
own
conception
of
life
had
created
in
spite
of
herself
she
was
a
child
of
the
new
era
of
the
universal
reaction
against
the
falseness
and
egotism
of
the
old
social
code
a
standard
of
conduct
regulated
by
the
needs
of
the
race
rather
than
by
individual
passion
a
conception
of
each
existence
as
a
link
in
the
great
chain
of
human
endeavour
had
slowly
shaped
itself
out
of
the
wild
theories
and
vague
codes
of
the
moralists
and
with
this
sense
of
the
sacramental
nature
of
human
ties
came
a
renewed
reverence
for
moral
and
physical
purity
fulvia
was
of
those
who
require
that
their
lives
shall
be
an
affirmation
of
themselves
and
the
lack
of
inner
harmony
drove
her
to
seek
some
outward
expression
of
her
ideals
she
threw
herself
with
renewed
passion
into
the
political
struggle
the
best
the
only
justification
of
her
power
was
to
use
it
boldly
openly
for
the
good
of
the
people
all
the
repressed
forces
of
her
nature
were
poured
into
this
single
channel
she
had
no
desire
to
conceal
her
situation
to
disguise
her
influence
over
odo
she
wished
it
rather
to
be
so
visible
a
factor
in
his
relations
with
his
people
that
she
should
come
to
be
regarded
as
the
ultimate
pledge
of
his
good
faith
but
like
all
the
casuistical
virtues
this
position
had
the
rigidity
of
something
created
to
fit
a
special
case
and
the
result
was
a
fixity
of
attitude
which
spread
benumbingly
over
her
whole
nature
she
was
conscious
of
the
change
yet
dared
not
struggle
against
it
since
to
do
so
was
to
confess
the
weakness
of
her
case
she
had
chosen
to
be
regarded
as
a
symbol
rather
than
a
woman
and
there
were
moments
when
she
felt
as
isolated
from
life
as
some
marble
allegory
in
its
niche
above
the
it
was
the
desire
to
associate
herself
with
the
duke
public
life
that
had
induced
her
after
much
hesitation
to
accept
the
degree
which
the
university
had
conferred
on
her
she
had
shared
eagerly
in
the
work
of
reconstructing
the
university
and
had
been
the
means
of
drawing
to
pianura
several
teachers
of
distinction
from
padua
and
pavia
it
was
her
dream
to
build
up
a
seat
of
learning
which
should
attract
students
from
all
parts
of
italy
and
though
many
young
men
of
good
family
had
withdrawn
from
the
classes
when
the
barnabites
were
dispossessed
she
was
confident
that
they
would
soon
be
replaced
by
scholars
from
other
states
she
was
resolved
to
identify
herself
openly
with
the
educational
reform
which
seemed
to
her
one
of
the
most
important
steps
toward
civic
emancipation
and
she
had
therefore
acceded
to
the
request
of
the
faculty
that
on
receiving
her
degree
she
should
sustain
a
thesis
before
the
university
this
ceremony
was
to
take
place
a
few
days
hence
on
the
duke
birthday
and
as
the
new
charter
was
to
be
proclaimed
on
the
same
day
fulvia
had
chosen
as
the
subject
of
her
discourse
the
constitution
recently
promulgated
in
france
she
pushed
aside
the
bundle
of
political
pamphlets
which
she
had
been
studying
and
sat
looking
out
at
the
strip
of
garden
beyond
the
arches
of
the
cloister
the
narrow
horizon
bounded
by
convent
walls
symbolised
fitly
enough
the
life
she
had
chosen
to
lead
a
life
of
artificial
restraints
and
renunciations
passive
conventual
almost
in
which
even
the
central
point
of
her
love
burned
now
with
a
calm
devotional
glow
the
door
in
the
cloister
opened
and
the
duke
crossed
the
garden
he
walked
slowly
with
the
listless
step
she
had
observed
in
him
of
late
and
as
he
entered
she
saw
that
he
looked
pale
and
weary
you
have
been
at
work
again
she
said
a
yes
he
answered
sinking
into
the
abbess
high
carved
chair
he
glanced
musingly
about
the
dim
room
in
which
the
shadow
of
the
cloister
made
an
early
dusk
its
atmosphere
of
monastic
calm
of
which
the
significance
did
not
escape
him
fell
soothingly
on
his
spirit
it
simplified
his
relation
to
fulvia
by
tacitly
restricting
it
within
the
bounds
of
a
tranquil
tenderness
any
other
setting
would
have
seemed
less
in
harmony
with
their
fate
better
perhaps
than
fulvia
he
knew
what
ailed
them
both
happiness
had
come
to
them
but
it
had
come
too
late
it
had
come
tinged
with
disloyalty
to
their
early
ideals
it
had
come
when
delay
and
disillusionment
had
imperceptibly
weakened
the
springs
of
passion
for
it
is
the
saddest
thing
about
sorrow
that
it
deadens
the
capacity
for
happiness
and
to
fulvia
and
odo
the
joy
they
had
renounced
had
returned
with
an
exile
alien
face
seeing
that
he
remained
silent
she
rose
and
lit
the
shaded
lamp
on
the
table
he
watched
her
as
she
moved
across
the
room
her
step
had
lost
none
of
its
flowing
grace
of
that
harmonious
impetus
which
years
ago
had
drawn
his
boyish
fancy
in
its
wake
as
she
bent
above
the
lamp
the
circle
of
light
threw
her
face
into
relief
against
the
deepening
shadows
of
the
room
she
had
changed
indeed
but
as
those
change
in
whom
the
springs
of
life
are
clear
and
abundant
it
was
a
development
rather
than
a
diminution
the
old
purity
of
outline
remained
and
deep
below
the
surface
but
still
visible
sometimes
to
his
lessening
insight
the
old
girlish
spirit
radiant
tender
and
impetuous
stirred
for
a
moment
in
her
eyes
the
lamplight
fell
on
the
pamphlets
she
had
pushed
aside
odo
picked
one
up
what
are
these
he
asked
they
were
sent
to
me
by
the
english
traveller
whom
andreoni
brought
here
he
turned
a
few
pages
the
old
story
he
said
do
you
never
weary
of
it
an
old
story
she
exclaimed
i
thought
it
had
been
the
newest
in
the
world
is
it
not
being
written
chapter
by
chapter
before
our
very
eyes
odo
laid
the
treatise
aside
are
you
never
afraid
to
turn
the
next
page
he
asked
afraid
afraid
of
what
that
it
may
be
written
in
blood
she
uttered
a
quick
exclamation
then
her
face
hardened
and
she
said
in
a
low
tone
de
crucis
has
been
with
you
he
made
the
gesture
of
the
man
who
feels
himself
drawn
into
a
familiar
argument
from
which
there
is
no
issue
he
left
yesterday
for
germany
he
was
here
too
long
she
said
with
an
uncontrollable
escape
of
bitterness
odo
sighed
if
you
would
but
let
me
bring
him
to
you
you
would
see
that
his
influence
over
me
is
not
what
you
think
it
she
was
silent
a
moment
then
she
said
you
are
tired
tonight
let
us
not
talk
of
these
things
as
you
please
he
answered
with
an
air
of
relief
and
she
rose
and
went
to
the
harpsichord
she
played
softly
with
a
veiled
touch
gliding
from
one
crepuscular
melody
to
another
till
the
room
was
filled
with
drifts
of
sound
that
seemed
like
the
voice
of
its
own
shadows
there
had
been
times
when
he
could
have
yielded
himself
to
this
languid
tide
of
music
letting
it
loosen
the
ties
of
thought
till
he
floated
out
into
the
soothing
dimness
of
sensation
but
now
the
present
held
him
to
fulvia
too
he
knew
the
music
was
but
a
forced
interlude
a
mechanical
refuge
from
thought
she
had
deliberately
narrowed
their
intercourse
to
one
central
idea
and
it
was
her
punishment
that
silence
had
come
to
be
merely
an
intensified
expression
of
this
idea
when
she
turned
to
odo
she
saw
the
same
consciousness
in
his
face
it
was
useless
for
them
to
talk
of
other
things
with
a
pang
of
unreasoning
regret
she
felt
that
she
had
become
to
him
the
embodiment
of
a
single
thought
a
formula
rather
than
a
woman
tell
me
what
you
have
been
doing
she
said
the
question
was
a
relief
at
once
he
began
to
separation
of
his
work
all
his
thoughts
all
his
time
were
given
to
the
constitution
which
was
to
define
the
powers
of
church
and
state
the
difficulties
increased
as
the
work
advanced
but
the
gravest
difficulty
was
one
of
which
he
dared
not
tell
her
his
own
growing
distrust
of
the
ideas
for
which
he
laboured
he
was
too
keenly
aware
of
the
difference
in
their
mental
operations
with
fulvia
ideas
were
either
rejected
or
at
once
converted
into
principles
with
himself
they
remained
stored
in
the
mind
serving
rather
as
commentaries
on
life
than
as
incentives
to
action
this
perpetual
accessibility
to
new
impressions
was
a
quality
she
could
not
understand
or
could
conceive
of
only
as
a
weakness
her
own
mind
was
like
a
garden
in
which
nothing
is
ever
transplanted
she
allowed
for
no
intermediate
stages
between
error
and
dogma
for
no
shifting
of
the
bounds
of
conviction
and
this
security
gave
her
the
singleness
of
purpose
in
which
he
found
himself
more
and
more
deficient
odo
remembered
that
he
had
once
thought
her
nearness
would
dispel
his
hesitations
at
first
it
had
been
so
but
gradually
the
contact
with
her
fixed
enthusiasms
had
set
up
within
him
an
opposing
sense
of
the
claims
ignored
the
element
of
dogmatism
in
her
faith
showed
the
discouraging
sameness
of
the
human
mind
he
perceived
that
to
a
spirit
like
it
might
become
possible
to
shed
blood
in
the
cause
of
tolerance
the
rapid
march
of
events
in
france
had
necessarily
produced
an
opposite
effect
on
minds
so
differently
constituted
to
fulvia
the
year
had
been
a
year
of
victory
a
glorious
affirmation
of
her
political
creed
step
by
step
she
had
seen
as
in
some
old
allegorical
painting
error
fly
before
the
shafts
of
truth
where
odo
beheld
a
conflagration
she
saw
a
sunrise
and
all
that
was
bare
and
cold
in
her
own
life
was
warmed
and
transfigured
by
that
ineffable
brightness
she
listened
patiently
while
he
enlarged
on
the
difficulties
of
the
case
the
constitution
was
framed
in
all
its
details
but
with
its
completion
he
felt
more
than
ever
doubtful
of
the
wisdom
of
granting
it
he
would
have
welcomed
any
postponement
that
did
not
seem
an
admission
of
fear
he
dreaded
the
inevitable
break
with
the
clergy
not
so
much
because
of
the
consequent
danger
to
his
own
authority
as
because
he
was
increasingly
conscious
of
the
newness
and
clumsiness
of
the
instrument
with
which
he
proposed
to
replace
their
tried
and
complex
system
he
mentioned
to
fulvia
the
rumours
of
popular
disaffection
but
she
swept
them
aside
with
a
smile
the
people
mistrust
you
she
said
and
what
does
that
mean
that
you
have
given
your
enemies
time
to
work
on
their
credulity
the
longer
you
delay
the
more
opposition
you
will
encounter
father
ignazio
would
rather
destroy
the
state
than
let
it
be
saved
by
any
hand
but
his
odo
reflected
of
all
my
enemies
he
said
father
ignazio
is
the
one
i
most
respect
because
he
is
the
most
sincere
he
is
the
most
dangerous
then
she
returned
a
fanatic
is
always
more
powerful
than
a
knave
he
was
struck
with
her
undiminished
faith
in
the
sufficiency
of
such
generalisations
did
she
really
think
that
to
solve
such
a
problem
it
was
only
necessary
to
define
it
the
contact
with
her
unfaltering
assurance
would
once
have
given
him
a
momentary
glow
but
now
it
left
him
cold
she
was
speaking
more
urgently
surely
she
said
the
noblest
use
a
man
can
make
of
his
own
freedom
is
to
set
others
free
my
father
said
it
was
the
only
justification
of
kingship
he
glanced
at
her
do
you
still
fancy
that
kings
are
free
i
am
bound
hand
and
foot
so
was
my
father
she
flashed
back
at
him
but
he
had
the
promethean
spirit
she
coloured
at
her
own
quickness
but
odo
took
the
thrust
tranquilly
yes
he
said
your
father
had
the
promethean
spirit
i
have
not
the
flesh
that
is
daily
torn
from
me
does
not
grow
again
your
courage
is
as
great
as
his
she
exclaimed
her
tenderness
in
arms
no
he
answered
for
his
was
hopeful
there
was
a
pause
and
then
he
began
to
speak
of
the
day
work
all
the
afternoon
he
had
been
in
consultation
with
crescenti
whose
vast
historical
knowledge
was
of
service
in
determining
many
disputed
points
in
the
tenure
of
land
the
librarian
was
in
sympathy
with
any
measures
tending
to
relieve
the
condition
of
the
peasantry
yet
he
was
almost
as
strongly
opposed
as
trescorre
to
any
reproduction
of
the
tuscan
constitution
he
is
afraid
broke
from
fulvia
she
admired
and
respected
crescenti
yet
she
had
never
fully
trusted
him
the
taint
of
ecclesiasticism
was
on
him
odo
smiled
he
has
never
been
afraid
of
facing
the
charge
of
jansenism
he
replied
all
his
life
he
has
stood
in
open
opposition
to
the
church
party
it
is
one
thing
to
criticise
their
dogmas
another
to
attack
their
privileges
at
such
a
time
he
is
bound
to
remember
that
he
is
a
priest
that
he
is
one
of
them
yet
as
you
have
often
pointed
out
it
is
to
the
clergy
that
france
in
great
measure
owes
her
release
from
feudalism
she
smiled
coldly
france
would
have
won
her
cause
without
the
clergy
this
is
not
france
then
he
said
with
a
sigh
after
a
moment
he
began
again
can
you
not
see
that
any
reform
which
aims
at
reducing
the
power
of
the
clergy
must
be
more
easily
and
successfully
carried
out
if
they
can
be
induced
to
take
part
in
it
that
in
short
we
need
them
at
this
moment
as
we
have
never
needed
them
before
the
example
of
france
ought
at
least
to
show
you
that
the
example
of
france
shows
me
that
to
gain
a
point
in
such
a
struggle
any
means
must
be
used
in
france
as
you
say
the
clergy
were
with
the
people
here
they
are
against
them
where
persuasion
fails
coercion
must
be
used
odo
smiled
faintly
you
might
have
borrowed
that
from
their
own
armoury
he
said
she
coloured
at
the
sarcasm
why
not
she
retorted
let
them
have
a
taste
of
their
own
methods
they
know
the
kind
of
pressure
that
makes
men
yield
when
they
feel
it
they
will
know
what
to
do
he
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
this
is
gamba
tone
he
said
i
have
never
heard
you
speak
in
this
way
before
she
coloured
again
and
now
with
a
profound
emotion
yes
she
said
it
is
gamba
tone
he
and
i
speak
for
the
same
cause
and
with
the
same
voice
we
are
of
the
people
and
we
speak
for
the
people
who
are
your
other
counsellors
priests
and
noblemen
it
is
natural
enough
that
they
should
wish
to
make
their
side
of
the
question
heard
listen
to
them
if
you
will
conciliate
them
if
you
can
we
need
all
the
allies
we
can
win
only
do
not
fancy
they
are
really
speaking
for
the
people
do
not
think
it
is
the
people
voice
you
hear
the
people
do
not
ask
you
to
weigh
this
claim
against
that
to
look
too
curiously
into
the
defects
and
merits
of
every
clause
in
their
charter
all
they
ask
is
that
the
charter
should
be
given
them
she
spoke
with
the
passion
that
possessed
her
at
such
moments
all
acrimony
had
vanished
from
her
tone
the
expression
of
a
great
conviction
had
swept
aside
every
personal
animosity
and
cleared
the
sources
of
her
deepest
feeling
odo
felt
the
pressure
of
her
emotion
he
leaned
to
her
and
their
hands
met
it
shall
be
given
them
he
said
she
lifted
her
face
to
his
it
shone
with
a
great
light
once
before
he
had
seen
it
so
illumined
but
with
how
different
a
brightness
the
remembrance
stirred
in
him
some
old
habit
of
the
senses
he
bent
over
and
kissed
her
never
before
had
odo
so
keenly
felt
the
difference
between
theoretical
visions
of
liberty
and
their
practical
application
his
deepest
showed
him
as
sincerely
devoted
as
ever
to
the
cause
which
had
enlisted
his
youth
he
still
longed
above
all
things
to
serve
his
fellows
but
the
conditions
of
such
service
were
not
what
he
had
dreamed
how
different
a
calling
it
had
been
in
saint
francis
day
when
hearts
inflamed
with
the
new
sense
of
brotherhood
had
but
to
set
forth
on
their
simple
mission
of
almsgiving
and
admonition
to
love
one
neighbour
had
become
a
much
more
complex
business
one
that
taxed
the
intelligence
as
much
as
the
heart
and
in
the
course
of
which
feeling
must
be
held
in
firm
subjection
to
reason
he
was
discouraged
by
fulvia
inability
to
understand
the
change
hers
was
the
missionary
spirit
and
he
could
not
but
reflect
how
much
happier
she
would
have
been
as
a
nun
in
a
charitable
order
a
unit
in
some
organised
system
of
beneficence
he
too
would
have
been
happier
to
serve
than
to
command
but
it
is
not
given
to
the
lovers
of
the
lady
poverty
to
choose
their
special
rank
in
her
household
don
gervaso
words
came
back
to
him
with
deepening
significance
and
he
thought
how
truly
the
old
chaplain
prayer
had
been
fulfilled
honour
and
power
had
come
to
him
and
they
had
abased
him
to
the
dust
the
humilitas
of
his
fathers
woven
carved
and
painted
on
every
side
pursued
him
with
an
ironical
reminder
of
his
impotence
fulvia
had
not
been
mistaken
in
attributing
his
depression
of
spirit
to
de
crucis
visit
it
was
the
first
time
that
de
crucis
had
returned
to
pianura
since
the
new
duke
accession
odo
had
welcomed
him
eagerly
had
again
pressed
him
to
remain
but
de
crucis
was
on
his
way
to
germany
bound
on
some
business
which
could
not
be
deferred
odo
aware
of
the
renewed
activity
of
the
jesuits
supposed
that
this
business
was
connected
with
the
flight
of
the
french
refugees
many
of
whom
were
gone
to
coblentz
but
on
this
point
the
abate
was
silent
of
the
state
of
affairs
in
france
he
spoke
openly
and
despondently
the
immoderate
haste
with
which
the
reforms
had
been
granted
filled
him
with
fears
for
the
future
odo
knew
that
crescenti
shared
these
fears
and
the
judgment
of
these
two
men
with
whom
he
differed
on
fundamental
principles
weighed
with
him
far
more
than
the
opinions
of
the
party
he
was
supposed
to
represent
but
he
was
in
the
case
of
many
greater
sovereigns
of
his
day
he
had
set
free
the
waters
of
reform
and
the
frail
bark
of
his
authority
had
been
torn
from
its
moorings
and
swept
headlong
into
the
central
current
the
next
morning
to
his
surprise
the
duchess
sent
one
of
her
gentlemen
to
ask
an
audience
odo
at
once
replied
that
he
would
wait
on
her
highness
and
a
few
moments
later
he
was
ushered
into
his
wife
closet
she
had
just
left
her
toilet
and
was
still
in
the
morning
negligee
worn
during
that
prolonged
and
public
ceremonial
freshly
perfumed
and
powdered
her
eyes
bright
her
lips
set
in
a
nervous
smile
she
curiously
recalled
the
arrogant
child
who
had
snatched
her
spaniel
away
from
him
years
ago
in
that
same
room
and
was
she
not
that
child
after
all
had
she
ever
grown
beyond
the
imperious
instincts
of
her
youth
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
he
had
judged
her
harshly
in
the
first
months
of
their
marriage
he
had
felt
a
momentary
impatience
when
he
had
tried
to
force
her
roving
impulses
into
the
line
of
his
own
endeavour
it
was
easier
to
view
her
leniently
now
that
she
had
almost
passed
out
of
his
life
he
wondered
why
she
had
sent
for
him
some
dispute
with
her
household
doubtless
a
quarrel
with
a
servant
even
or
perhaps
some
sordid
difficulty
with
her
creditors
but
she
began
in
a
new
key
your
highness
she
said
is
not
given
to
taking
my
advice
odo
looked
at
her
in
surprise
the
opportunity
is
not
often
accorded
me
he
replied
with
a
smile
maria
clementina
made
an
impatient
gesture
then
her
face
softened
contradictory
emotions
flitted
over
it
like
the
reflections
cast
by
a
hurrying
sky
she
came
close
to
him
and
then
drew
away
and
seated
herself
in
the
chair
where
she
had
throned
when
he
first
saw
her
suddenly
she
blushed
and
began
to
speak
once
she
said
in
a
low
almost
inaudible
voice
i
was
able
to
give
your
highness
warning
of
an
impending
danger
she
paused
and
her
eyes
rested
full
on
odo
he
felt
his
colour
rise
as
he
returned
her
gaze
it
was
her
first
allusion
to
the
past
he
had
supposed
she
had
forgotten
for
a
moment
he
remained
awkwardly
silent
do
you
remember
she
asked
i
remember
the
danger
was
a
grave
one
your
highness
may
recall
that
but
for
my
warning
you
would
not
have
been
advised
of
it
i
remember
he
said
again
she
paused
a
moment
the
danger
she
repeated
was
a
grave
one
but
it
threatened
only
your
highness
person
your
highness
listened
to
me
then
will
you
listen
again
if
i
advise
you
of
a
greater
a
peril
threatening
not
only
your
person
but
your
throne
odo
smiled
he
could
guess
now
what
was
coming
she
had
been
drilled
to
act
as
the
mouthpiece
of
the
opposition
he
composed
his
features
and
said
quietly
these
are
grave
words
madam
i
know
of
no
such
peril
but
i
am
always
ready
to
listen
to
your
highness
his
smile
had
betrayed
him
and
a
quick
flame
of
anger
passed
over
her
face
why
should
you
listen
to
me
since
you
never
heed
what
i
say
your
highness
has
just
reminded
me
that
i
did
so
once
once
she
repeated
bitterly
you
were
younger
then
and
so
was
i
she
glanced
at
herself
in
the
mirror
with
a
dissatisfied
laugh
something
in
her
look
and
movement
touched
the
springs
of
compassion
try
me
again
he
said
gently
if
i
am
older
perhaps
i
am
also
wiser
and
therefore
even
more
willing
to
be
guided
we
all
knew
that
she
broke
off
as
though
she
felt
her
mistake
and
wished
to
make
a
fresh
beginning
again
her
face
was
full
of
fluctuating
meaning
and
he
saw
beneath
its
shallow
surface
the
eddy
of
incoherent
impulses
when
she
spoke
it
was
with
a
noble
gravity
your
highness
she
said
does
not
take
me
into
your
counsels
but
it
is
no
secret
at
court
and
in
the
town
that
you
have
in
contemplation
a
grave
political
measure
i
have
made
no
secret
of
it
he
replied
no
or
i
should
be
the
last
to
know
it
she
exclaimed
with
one
of
her
sudden
lapses
into
petulance
odo
made
no
reply
her
futility
was
beginning
to
weary
him
she
saw
it
and
again
attempted
an
impersonal
dignity
of
manner
it
has
been
your
highness
choice
she
said
to
exclude
me
from
public
affairs
perhaps
i
was
not
fitted
by
education
or
intelligence
to
share
in
the
cares
of
government
your
highness
will
at
least
bear
witness
that
i
have
scrupulously
respected
your
decision
and
have
never
attempted
to
intrude
upon
your
counsels
odo
bowed
it
would
have
been
useless
to
remind
her
that
he
had
sought
her
help
and
failed
to
obtain
it
i
have
accepted
my
position
she
continued
i
have
led
the
life
to
which
it
has
pleased
your
highness
to
restrict
me
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
detach
my
heart
as
well
as
my
thoughts
from
your
interests
i
have
not
learned
to
be
indifferent
to
your
danger
odo
looked
up
quickly
she
ceased
to
interest
him
when
she
spoke
by
the
book
and
he
was
impatient
to
make
an
end
you
spoke
of
danger
before
he
said
what
danger
that
of
forcing
on
your
subjects
liberties
which
they
do
not
desire
ah
said
he
thoughtfully
that
was
all
then
what
a
poor
tool
she
made
he
marvelled
that
in
all
these
years
trescorre
skilful
hands
should
not
have
fashioned
her
to
better
purpose
your
highness
he
said
has
reminded
me
that
since
our
marriage
you
had
lived
withdrawn
from
public
affairs
i
will
not
pause
to
dispute
by
whose
choice
this
has
been
i
will
in
turn
merely
remind
your
highness
that
such
a
life
does
not
afford
much
opportunity
of
gauging
public
opinion
in
spite
of
himself
a
note
of
sarcasm
had
again
crept
into
his
voice
but
to
his
surprise
she
did
not
seem
to
resent
it
ah
she
exclaimed
with
more
feeling
than
she
had
hitherto
shown
you
fancy
that
because
i
am
kept
in
ignorance
of
what
you
think
i
am
ignorant
also
of
what
others
think
of
you
believe
me
she
said
with
a
flash
of
insight
that
startled
him
i
know
more
of
you
than
if
we
stood
closer
but
you
mistake
my
purpose
i
have
not
sent
for
you
to
force
my
counsels
on
you
i
have
no
desire
to
appear
ridiculous
i
do
not
ask
you
to
hear
what
think
of
your
course
but
what
others
think
of
it
what
others
the
question
did
not
disconcert
her
your
subjects
she
said
quickly
my
subjects
are
of
many
classes
all
are
of
one
class
in
resenting
this
charter
i
am
told
you
intend
to
proclaim
it
within
a
few
days
i
entreat
you
at
least
to
delay
to
reconsider
your
course
oh
believe
me
when
i
say
you
are
in
danger
of
what
use
to
offer
a
crown
to
our
lady
when
you
have
it
in
your
heart
to
slight
her
servants
but
i
will
not
speak
of
the
clergy
since
you
despise
them
nor
of
the
nobles
since
you
ignore
their
claims
i
will
speak
only
of
the
people
the
people
in
whose
interest
you
profess
to
act
believe
me
in
striking
at
the
church
you
wound
the
poor
it
is
not
their
bodily
welfare
i
mean
though
heaven
knows
how
many
sources
of
bounty
must
now
run
dry
it
is
their
faith
you
insult
first
you
turn
them
against
their
masters
then
against
their
god
they
may
acclaim
you
for
it
now
but
i
tell
you
they
will
hate
you
for
it
in
the
end
she
paused
flushed
with
the
vehemence
of
her
argument
and
eager
to
press
it
farther
but
her
last
words
had
touched
an
unexpected
fibre
in
odo
he
looked
at
her
with
his
unseeing
visionary
gaze
the
end
he
murmured
who
knows
what
the
end
will
be
do
you
still
need
to
be
told
she
exclaimed
must
you
always
come
to
me
to
learn
that
you
are
in
danger
if
the
state
is
in
danger
the
danger
must
be
faced
the
state
exists
for
the
people
if
they
do
not
need
it
it
has
ceased
to
serve
its
purpose
she
clasped
her
hands
in
an
ecstasy
of
wonder
oh
fool
madman
but
it
is
not
of
the
state
i
speak
it
is
you
who
are
in
danger
you
you
you
he
raised
his
head
with
an
impatient
gesture
i
he
said
i
had
thought
you
meant
a
graver
peril
she
looked
at
him
in
silence
her
pride
met
his
and
thrilled
with
it
and
for
a
moment
the
two
were
one
odo
she
cried
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
he
went
to
her
and
took
her
hand
such
fears
are
worthy
neither
of
us
he
said
gravely
i
am
not
ashamed
of
them
she
said
her
hand
clung
to
him
and
she
lifted
her
eyes
to
his
face
you
will
listen
to
me
she
whispered
in
a
glow
he
drew
back
chilled
if
only
she
had
kept
the
feminine
in
abeyance
but
sex
was
her
only
weapon
i
have
listened
he
said
quietly
and
i
thank
you
but
you
will
not
be
counselled
in
the
last
issue
one
must
be
one
own
counsellor
her
face
flamed
if
you
were
but
that
she
tossed
back
at
him
the
taunt
struck
him
full
he
knew
that
he
should
have
let
it
lie
but
he
caught
it
up
in
spite
of
himself
madam
he
said
i
should
have
appealed
to
our
sovereign
not
to
her
servant
she
cried
dashing
into
the
breach
she
had
made
he
stood
motionless
stunned
almost
for
what
she
had
said
was
true
he
was
no
longer
the
sovereign
the
rule
had
passed
out
of
his
hands
his
silence
frightened
her
with
an
instinctive
jealousy
she
saw
that
her
words
had
started
a
train
of
thought
in
which
she
had
no
part
she
felt
herself
ignored
abandoned
and
all
her
passions
rushed
to
the
defence
of
her
wounded
vanity
oh
believe
me
she
cried
i
speak
as
your
duchess
not
as
your
wife
that
is
a
name
in
which
i
should
never
dream
of
appealing
to
you
i
have
ever
stood
apart
from
your
private
pleasures
as
became
a
woman
of
my
house
she
faced
him
with
a
flash
of
the
austrian
insolence
but
when
i
see
the
state
drifting
to
ruin
as
the
result
of
your
caprice
when
i
see
your
own
life
endangered
your
people
turned
against
you
religion
openly
insulted
law
and
authority
made
the
plaything
of
this
this
false
atheistical
creature
that
has
robbed
me
robbed
me
of
all
she
broke
off
helplessly
and
hid
her
face
with
a
sob
odo
stood
speechless
he
could
not
mistake
what
had
happened
the
woman
had
surged
to
the
surface
at
last
the
real
woman
passionate
undisciplined
but
so
piteous
after
all
in
this
sudden
subjection
to
the
one
tenderness
that
survived
in
her
she
loved
him
and
was
jealous
of
her
rival
that
was
the
instinct
which
had
swept
all
others
aside
at
that
moment
she
cared
nothing
for
her
safety
or
his
the
state
might
perish
if
they
but
fell
together
it
was
the
distance
between
them
that
maddened
her
the
tragic
simplicity
of
the
revelation
left
odo
silent
for
a
fantastic
moment
he
yielded
to
the
vision
of
what
that
waste
power
might
have
accomplished
life
seemed
to
him
a
confusion
of
roving
force
that
met
only
to
crash
in
ruins
his
silence
drew
her
to
her
feet
she
repossessed
herself
throbbing
but
valiant
my
fears
for
your
highness
safety
have
led
my
speech
astray
i
have
given
your
highness
the
warning
it
was
my
duty
to
give
beyond
that
i
had
no
thought
of
trespassing
and
still
odo
was
silent
a
dozen
answers
struggled
to
his
lips
but
they
were
checked
by
the
stealing
sense
of
duality
that
so
often
paralysed
his
action
he
had
recovered
his
lucidity
of
vision
and
his
impulses
faded
before
it
like
mist
he
saw
life
again
as
it
was
an
incomplete
and
shabby
business
a
patchwork
of
torn
and
ravelled
effort
everywhere
the
shears
of
atropos
were
busy
and
never
could
the
cut
threads
be
joined
again
he
took
his
wife
hand
and
bent
over
it
ceremoniously
it
lay
in
his
like
a
stone
the
jubilee
of
the
mountain
madonna
fell
on
the
feast
of
the
purification
it
was
but
with
a
sky
of
june
the
autumn
rains
had
ceased
for
the
moment
and
fields
and
orchards
glistened
with
a
late
verdure
never
had
the
faithful
gathered
in
such
numbers
to
do
honour
to
the
virgin
a
widespread
resistance
to
the
influences
of
free
thought
and
jansenism
was
pouring
fresh
life
into
the
old
formulas
of
devotion
though
many
motives
combined
to
strengthen
this
movement
it
was
still
mainly
a
simple
expression
of
loyalty
to
old
ideals
an
instinctive
rallying
around
a
threatened
cause
it
is
the
honest
conviction
underlying
all
great
popular
impulses
that
gives
them
their
real
strength
and
in
this
case
the
thousands
of
pilgrims
flocking
on
foot
to
the
mountain
shrine
embodied
a
greater
moral
force
than
the
powerful
ecclesiastics
at
whose
call
they
had
gathered
the
clergy
themselves
were
come
from
all
sides
while
those
that
were
unable
to
attend
had
sent
costly
gifts
to
the
miraculous
virgin
the
bishops
of
mantua
modena
vercelli
and
cremona
had
travelled
to
pianura
in
state
the
people
flocking
out
beyond
the
gates
to
welcome
them
four
mitred
abbots
several
monsignori
and
priors
rectors
and
canons
innumerable
rode
in
the
procession
followed
on
foot
by
the
humble
army
of
parish
priests
and
by
interminable
confraternities
of
all
orders
the
approach
of
the
great
dignitaries
was
hailed
with
enthusiasm
by
the
crowds
lining
the
roads
even
the
bishop
of
pianura
never
popular
with
the
people
received
an
unwonted
measure
of
applause
and
the
prior
of
the
dominicans
riding
by
stern
and
as
a
monk
of
zurbaran
was
greeted
with
frenzied
acclamations
the
report
that
the
bishop
and
the
heads
of
the
religious
houses
in
pianura
were
to
set
free
suppers
for
the
pilgrims
had
doubtless
quickened
this
outburst
of
piety
yet
it
was
perhaps
chiefly
due
to
the
sense
of
coming
peril
that
had
gradually
permeated
the
dim
consciousness
of
the
crowd
in
the
church
the
glow
of
lights
the
thrilling
beauty
of
the
music
and
the
glitter
of
the
priestly
vestments
were
blent
in
a
melting
harmony
of
sound
and
colour
the
shrine
of
the
madonna
shone
with
unearthly
radiance
hundreds
of
candles
formed
an
elongated
nimbus
about
her
hieratic
figure
which
was
surmounted
by
the
canopy
of
presented
by
the
duke
of
modena
the
bishops
of
vercelli
and
cremona
had
offered
a
robe
of
silver
brocade
studded
with
coral
and
turquoises
the
devout
princess
clotilda
of
savoy
an
emerald
necklace
the
bishop
of
pianura
a
marvellous
veil
of
made
in
a
flemish
convent
while
on
the
statue
brow
rested
the
duke
jewelled
diadem
the
duke
himself
seated
in
his
tribune
above
the
choir
observed
the
scene
with
a
renewed
appreciation
of
the
church
unfailing
dramatic
instinct
at
first
he
saw
in
the
spectacle
only
this
outer
and
symbolic
side
of
which
the
mere
sensuous
beauty
had
always
deeply
moved
him
but
as
he
watched
the
effect
produced
on
the
great
throng
filling
the
aisles
he
began
to
see
that
this
external
splendour
was
but
the
veil
before
the
sanctuary
and
to
realise
what
de
crucis
meant
when
he
spoke
of
the
deep
hold
of
the
church
upon
the
people
every
colour
every
gesture
every
word
and
note
of
music
that
made
up
the
texture
of
the
gorgeous
ceremonial
might
indeed
seem
part
of
a
and
effect
yet
each
had
its
root
in
some
instinct
of
the
heart
some
natural
development
of
the
inner
life
so
that
they
were
in
fact
not
the
fragments
of
an
arbitrary
pattern
but
the
inseparable
fibres
of
a
living
organism
it
was
odo
misfortune
to
see
too
far
ahead
on
the
road
along
which
his
destiny
was
urging
him
as
he
sat
there
face
to
face
with
the
people
he
was
trying
to
lead
he
heard
above
the
music
of
the
mass
and
the
chant
of
the
kneeling
throng
an
echo
of
the
question
that
don
gervaso
had
once
put
to
him
if
you
take
christ
from
the
people
what
have
you
to
give
them
instead
he
was
roused
by
a
burst
of
silver
clarions
the
mass
was
over
and
the
duke
and
duchess
were
to
descend
from
their
tribune
and
venerate
the
holy
image
before
it
was
carried
through
the
church
odo
rose
and
gave
his
hand
to
his
wife
they
had
not
seen
each
other
save
in
public
since
their
last
conversation
in
her
closet
the
duchess
walked
with
set
lips
and
head
erect
keeping
her
profile
turned
to
him
as
they
descended
the
steps
and
advanced
to
the
choir
none
knew
better
how
to
take
her
part
in
such
a
pageant
she
had
the
gift
of
drawing
upon
herself
the
undivided
attention
of
any
assemblage
in
which
she
moved
and
the
consciousness
of
this
power
lent
a
kind
of
olympian
buoyancy
to
her
gait
the
richness
of
her
dress
and
her
extravagant
display
of
jewels
seemed
almost
a
challenge
to
the
sacred
image
blazing
like
a
rainbow
beneath
its
golden
canopy
and
odo
smiled
to
think
that
his
childish
fancy
had
once
compared
the
brilliant
being
at
his
side
to
the
humble
virgin
of
the
church
at
pontesordo
as
the
couple
advanced
stillness
fell
on
the
church
the
air
was
full
of
the
lingering
haze
of
incense
through
which
the
sunlight
from
the
clerestory
poured
in
prismatic
splendours
on
the
statue
of
the
virgin
rigid
superhuman
a
molten
flamboyancy
of
gold
and
gems
the
madonna
shone
out
above
her
worshippers
the
duke
and
duchess
paused
bowing
deeply
below
the
choir
then
they
mounted
the
steps
and
knelt
before
the
shrine
as
they
did
so
a
crash
broke
the
silence
and
the
startled
devotees
saw
that
the
ducal
diadem
had
fallen
from
the
madonna
head
the
hush
prolonged
itself
a
moment
then
a
canon
sprang
forward
to
pick
up
the
crown
and
with
the
movement
a
murmur
rose
and
spread
through
the
church
the
duke
offering
had
fallen
to
the
ground
as
he
approached
to
venerate
the
blessed
image
that
this
was
an
omen
no
man
could
doubt
it
needed
no
augur
to
interpret
it
the
murmur
gathering
force
as
it
swept
through
the
packed
aisles
passed
from
surprise
to
fear
from
fear
to
a
deep
hum
of
anger
for
the
people
understood
as
plainly
as
though
she
had
spoken
that
the
virgin
of
the
valseccas
had
cast
from
her
the
gift
of
an
unbeliever
the
ceremonies
over
the
long
procession
was
formed
again
and
set
out
toward
the
city
the
crowd
had
surged
ahead
and
when
the
duke
rode
through
the
gates
the
streets
were
already
thronged
moving
slowly
between
the
compact
mass
of
people
he
felt
himself
as
closely
observed
as
on
the
day
of
his
state
entry
but
with
far
different
effect
enthusiasm
had
given
way
to
a
cold
curiosity
the
excitement
of
the
spectators
had
spent
itself
in
the
morning
and
the
sight
of
their
sovereign
failed
to
rouse
their
flagging
ardour
now
and
then
a
cheer
broke
out
but
it
died
again
without
kindling
another
in
the
uninflammable
mass
odo
could
not
tell
how
much
of
this
indifference
was
due
to
a
natural
reaction
from
the
emotions
of
the
morning
how
much
to
his
personal
unpopularity
how
much
to
the
ominous
impression
produced
by
the
falling
of
the
virgin
crown
he
rode
between
his
people
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
estrangement
such
as
he
had
never
known
he
felt
himself
shut
off
from
them
by
an
impassable
barrier
of
superstition
and
ignorance
and
every
effort
to
reach
them
was
like
the
wrong
turn
in
a
labyrinth
drawing
him
farther
away
from
the
issue
to
which
it
seemed
to
lead
as
he
advanced
under
this
indifferent
or
hostile
scrutiny
he
thought
how
much
easier
it
would
be
to
face
a
rain
of
bullets
than
this
withering
glare
of
criticism
a
sudden
longing
to
escape
to
be
done
with
it
all
came
over
him
with
sickening
force
his
nerves
ached
with
the
physical
strain
of
holding
himself
upright
on
his
horse
of
preserving
the
statuesque
erectness
proper
to
the
occasion
he
felt
like
one
of
his
own
ancestral
effigies
of
which
the
wooden
framework
had
rotted
under
the
splendid
robes
a
congestion
at
the
head
of
a
narrow
street
had
checked
the
procession
and
he
was
obliged
to
rein
in
his
horse
he
looked
about
and
found
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
square
near
the
baptistery
a
few
feet
off
directly
in
a
line
with
him
was
the
front
of
the
royal
he
raised
his
head
and
saw
a
group
of
people
on
the
balcony
though
they
were
close
at
hand
he
saw
them
in
a
blur
against
which
fulvia
figure
suddenly
detached
itself
she
had
told
him
that
she
was
to
view
the
procession
with
the
andreonis
but
through
the
mental
haze
which
enveloped
him
her
apparition
struck
a
vague
surprise
he
looked
at
her
intently
and
their
eyes
met
a
faint
happiness
stole
over
her
face
but
no
recognition
was
possible
and
she
continued
to
gaze
out
steadily
upon
the
throng
below
the
balcony
involuntarily
his
glance
followed
hers
and
he
saw
that
she
was
herself
the
centre
of
the
crowd
attention
her
plain
almost
quakerish
habit
and
the
tranquil
dignity
of
her
carriage
made
her
a
conspicuous
figure
among
the
animated
groups
in
the
adjoining
windows
and
odo
with
the
acuteness
of
perception
which
a
public
life
develops
was
instantly
aware
that
her
name
was
on
every
lip
at
the
same
moment
he
saw
a
woman
close
to
his
horse
feet
snatch
up
her
child
and
make
the
sign
against
the
evil
eye
a
boy
who
stood
staring
at
fulvia
caught
the
gesture
and
repeated
it
a
barefoot
friar
imitated
the
boy
and
it
seemed
to
odo
that
the
familiar
sign
was
spreading
with
malignant
rapidity
to
the
furthest
limits
of
the
crowd
the
impression
was
only
momentary
for
the
cavalcade
was
again
in
motion
and
without
raising
his
eyes
he
rode
on
sick
at
heart
at
nightfall
a
man
opened
the
gate
of
the
ducal
gardens
below
the
chinese
pavilion
and
stepped
out
into
the
deserted
lane
he
locked
the
gate
and
slipped
the
key
into
his
pocket
then
he
turned
and
walked
toward
the
centre
of
the
town
as
he
reached
the
more
populous
quarters
his
walk
slackened
to
a
stroll
and
now
and
then
he
paused
to
observe
a
knot
of
or
look
through
the
curtains
of
the
tents
set
up
in
the
squares
the
man
was
plainly
but
decently
dressed
like
a
petty
tradesman
or
a
lawyer
clerk
and
the
night
being
chill
he
wore
a
cloak
and
had
drawn
his
over
his
forehead
he
sauntered
on
letting
the
crowd
carry
him
with
the
air
of
one
who
has
an
hour
to
kill
and
whose
takes
the
form
of
an
amused
spectatorship
to
such
an
observer
the
streets
offered
ample
entertainment
the
shrewd
air
discouraged
lounging
and
kept
the
crowd
in
motion
but
the
open
platforms
built
for
dancing
were
thronged
with
couples
and
every
and
astrologer
booth
was
packed
to
the
doors
the
shrines
and
being
all
alight
and
booths
and
platforms
hung
with
countless
lanterns
the
scene
was
as
bright
as
day
but
in
the
medley
of
liveries
monkish
cowls
and
carnival
disguises
a
man
might
easily
go
unremarked
reaching
the
square
before
the
cathedral
the
solitary
observer
pushed
his
way
through
the
idlers
gathered
about
a
dais
with
a
curtain
at
the
back
before
the
curtain
stood
a
milanese
quack
dressed
like
a
noble
gentleman
with
sword
and
plumed
hat
and
rehearsing
his
cures
in
stentorian
tones
while
his
zany
in
the
short
mask
and
habit
of
brighella
cracked
jokes
and
turned
for
the
diversion
of
the
vulgar
behold
the
charlatan
was
shouting
the
marvellous
egyptian
distilled
from
the
pearl
that
the
great
emperor
antony
dropped
into
queen
cleopatra
cup
this
infallible
fluid
handed
down
for
generations
in
the
family
of
my
ancestor
the
high
priest
of
isis
the
bray
of
a
neighbouring
trumpet
cut
him
short
and
yielding
to
circumstances
he
drew
back
the
curtain
and
a
sprang
out
and
began
her
antics
on
the
front
of
the
stage
what
did
he
say
was
the
price
of
that
drink
giannina
asked
a
young
pulling
her
neighbour
sleeve
are
you
thinking
of
buying
it
for
pietrino
my
beauty
the
other
returned
with
a
laugh
believe
me
it
is
a
sound
proverb
that
says
when
the
fruit
is
ripe
it
falls
of
itself
the
girl
drew
away
angrily
and
the
quack
took
up
his
harangue
the
same
philter
ladies
and
gentlemen
though
in
confessing
it
i
betray
a
professional
secret
the
same
philter
i
declare
to
you
on
the
honour
of
a
nobleman
whereby
in
your
own
city
a
lady
no
longer
young
and
no
way
remarkable
in
looks
or
station
has
captured
and
subjugated
the
affections
of
one
so
high
so
exalted
so
above
all
others
in
beauty
rank
wealth
power
and
dignities
oh
oh
that
the
duke
sniggered
a
voice
in
the
crowd
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
name
no
names
cried
the
quack
impressively
no
need
to
retorted
the
voice
they
do
say
though
she
gave
him
something
to
drink
said
a
young
woman
to
a
youth
in
a
clerk
dress
the
saying
is
she
studied
medicine
with
the
turks
the
moors
you
mean
said
the
clerk
with
an
air
of
superiority
well
they
say
her
mother
was
a
turkey
slave
and
her
father
a
murderer
from
the
sultan
galleys
no
no
she
plain
piedmontese
i
tell
you
her
father
was
a
physician
in
turin
and
was
driven
out
of
the
country
for
poisoning
his
patients
in
order
to
watch
their
they
say
she
good
to
the
poor
though
said
another
voice
doubtfully
good
to
the
poor
ay
that
what
they
said
of
her
father
all
i
know
is
that
she
heard
stefano
the
weaver
lad
had
the
falling
sickness
and
she
carried
him
a
potion
with
her
own
hands
and
the
next
day
the
child
was
dead
and
a
carmelite
friar
who
saw
the
phial
he
drank
from
said
it
was
the
same
shape
and
size
as
one
that
was
found
in
a
witch
grave
when
they
were
digging
the
foundations
for
the
new
monastery
ladies
and
gentlemen
shrieked
the
quack
what
am
i
offered
for
a
drop
of
this
priceless
liquor
the
listener
turned
aside
and
pushed
his
way
toward
the
farther
end
of
the
square
as
he
did
so
he
ran
against
a
who
thrust
a
long
printed
sheet
in
his
hand
buy
my
satirical
ballads
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
fellow
shouted
two
for
a
farthing
invented
and
written
by
an
own
cousin
of
the
great
pasquino
of
rome
what
will
you
have
sir
here
the
secret
history
of
a
famous
prince
amours
with
an
atheist
here
the
true
scandal
of
an
illustrious
lady
necklace
two
for
a
farthing
and
my
humblest
thanks
to
your
excellency
he
pocketed
the
coin
and
the
other
thrusting
the
broadsheets
beneath
his
cloak
pushed
on
to
the
nearest
here
every
table
was
thronged
and
the
babble
of
talk
so
loud
that
the
stranger
hopeless
of
obtaining
refreshment
pressed
his
way
into
the
remotest
corner
of
the
room
and
seated
himself
on
an
empty
cask
at
first
he
sat
motionless
silently
observing
the
crowd
then
he
drew
forth
the
ballads
and
ran
his
eye
over
them
he
was
still
engaged
in
this
study
when
his
notice
was
attracted
by
a
loud
discussion
going
forward
between
a
party
of
men
at
the
nearest
table
the
disputants
petty
tradesman
or
artisans
by
their
dress
had
evidently
been
warmed
by
a
good
flagon
of
wine
and
their
tones
were
so
lively
that
every
word
reached
the
listener
on
the
cask
reform
reform
cried
one
who
appeared
by
his
dress
and
manner
to
be
the
weightiest
of
the
company
it
all
very
well
to
cry
reform
but
what
i
say
is
that
most
of
those
that
are
howling
for
it
no
more
know
what
they
asking
than
a
parrot
that
been
taught
the
litany
now
the
first
question
is
who
benefits
by
your
reform
and
what
the
answer
to
that
eh
is
it
the
tradesmen
the
merchants
the
clerks
artisans
household
servants
i
ask
you
i
hear
some
of
my
complaining
that
the
nobility
do
pay
their
bills
will
they
be
better
paid
think
you
when
the
duke
has
halved
their
revenues
will
the
quality
keep
up
as
large
households
employ
as
many
lacqueys
set
as
lavish
tables
wear
as
fine
clothes
collect
as
many
rarities
buy
as
many
horses
give
us
in
short
as
many
opportunities
of
making
our
profit
out
of
their
pleasure
what
i
say
is
if
we
to
have
new
taxes
do
let
them
fall
on
the
very
class
we
live
by
that
true
enough
said
another
speaker
a
lean
bilious
man
with
a
pen
behind
his
ear
the
peasantry
are
the
only
class
that
are
going
to
profit
by
this
constitution
and
what
do
the
peasantry
do
for
us
i
should
like
to
know
the
first
speaker
went
on
triumphantly
as
far
as
the
fat
friars
go
i
not
sorry
to
see
them
squeezed
a
trifle
for
they
wrung
enough
money
out
of
our
to
lie
between
feathers
from
now
till
doomsday
but
i
say
if
you
care
for
your
pockets
do
lay
hands
on
the
nobility
gently
gently
my
friend
exclaimed
a
cautious
man
setting
down
his
glass
father
and
son
for
four
generations
my
family
have
served
pianura
with
church
candles
and
i
can
tell
you
that
since
these
new
atheistical
notions
came
in
the
nobility
are
not
the
good
patrons
they
used
to
be
but
as
for
the
friars
i
should
be
sorry
to
see
them
meddled
with
it
true
they
may
get
the
best
morsel
in
the
pot
and
the
warmest
seat
on
the
hearth
and
one
of
them
now
and
then
may
take
too
long
to
teach
a
pretty
girl
her
pater
noster
but
i
not
sure
we
shall
be
better
off
when
they
gone
formerly
if
a
child
too
many
came
to
poor
folk
they
could
always
comfort
themselves
with
the
thought
that
if
there
was
no
room
for
him
at
home
the
church
was
there
to
provide
for
him
but
if
we
drive
out
the
good
friars
a
man
will
have
to
count
mouths
before
he
dares
look
at
his
wife
too
lovingly
well
said
the
scribe
with
a
dry
smile
i
a
notion
the
good
friars
have
always
taken
more
than
they
gave
and
if
it
were
not
for
the
gaping
mouths
under
the
cowl
even
a
poor
man
might
have
victuals
enough
for
his
own
the
first
speaker
turned
on
him
contentiously
do
i
understand
you
are
for
this
new
charter
then
he
asked
no
no
said
the
other
better
hot
polenta
than
a
cold
ortolan
things
are
none
too
good
as
they
are
but
i
never
care
to
taste
first
of
a
new
dish
and
in
this
case
i
do
fancy
the
cook
ah
that
it
said
the
soft
man
it
too
much
like
the
wife
mixing
his
drugs
for
him
men
of
roman
lineage
want
no
women
to
govern
them
he
puffed
himself
out
and
thrust
a
hand
in
his
bosom
besides
gentlemen
he
added
dropping
his
voice
and
glancing
cautiously
about
the
room
the
saints
are
my
witness
i
not
superstitious
but
frankly
now
i
do
much
fancy
this
business
of
the
virgin
crown
what
do
you
mean
asked
a
lean
youth
who
had
been
drinking
and
listening
why
sir
i
need
say
i
the
last
man
in
pianura
to
listen
to
women
tattle
but
my
wife
had
it
straight
from
cino
the
barber
whose
sister
is
portress
of
the
benedictines
that
two
days
since
one
of
the
nuns
foretold
the
whole
business
precisely
as
it
happened
and
more
many
that
were
in
the
church
this
morning
will
tell
you
that
they
distinctly
saw
the
blessed
image
raise
both
arms
and
tear
the
crown
from
her
head
h
said
the
young
man
flippantly
what
became
of
the
bambino
meanwhile
i
wonder
the
scribe
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
all
know
said
he
that
cino
the
barber
lies
like
a
christened
jew
but
i
not
surprised
the
thing
was
known
in
advance
for
i
make
no
doubt
the
priests
pulled
the
wires
that
brought
down
the
crown
the
fat
man
looked
scandalised
and
the
first
speaker
waved
the
subject
aside
as
unworthy
of
attention
such
tales
are
for
women
and
monks
he
said
impatiently
but
the
business
has
its
serious
side
i
tell
you
we
are
being
hurried
to
our
ruin
here
this
matter
of
draining
the
marshes
at
pontesordo
who
to
pay
for
that
the
class
that
profits
by
it
not
by
a
long
way
it
we
who
drain
the
land
and
the
peasants
are
to
live
on
it
the
visionary
youth
tossed
back
his
hair
but
is
that
an
inspiration
to
you
sir
he
exclaimed
does
not
your
heart
dilate
at
the
thought
of
uplifting
the
condition
of
your
fellows
my
fellows
the
peasantry
my
fellows
cried
the
other
i
have
you
know
my
young
master
that
i
come
of
a
long
and
honourable
line
of
that
have
had
their
names
on
the
guild
for
two
hundred
years
and
over
i
nothing
to
do
with
the
peasantry
thank
god
the
youth
had
emptied
another
glass
what
he
screamed
you
deny
the
universal
kinship
of
man
you
disown
your
starving
brothers
proud
tyrant
remember
the
bastille
he
burst
into
tears
and
began
to
quote
alfieri
well
said
the
fat
man
turning
a
disgusted
shoulder
on
this
display
of
emotion
to
my
mind
this
business
of
draining
pontesordo
is
too
much
like
telling
the
almighty
what
to
do
if
god
made
the
land
wet
what
right
have
we
to
dry
it
those
that
begin
by
meddling
with
the
works
may
end
by
laying
hands
on
the
creator
you
right
said
another
there
no
knowing
where
these
notions
may
land
us
for
my
part
i
was
rather
taken
by
them
at
first
but
since
i
find
that
his
highness
to
pay
for
all
his
good
works
is
cutting
down
his
household
and
throwing
decent
people
out
of
a
job
like
my
own
son
for
instance
that
was
one
of
the
boys
at
the
palace
why
since
then
i
begin
to
see
a
little
farther
into
the
game
a
shabby
fellow
in
a
dirty
coat
and
stock
had
sauntered
up
to
the
table
and
stood
listening
with
an
amused
smile
ah
said
the
scribe
glancing
up
here
a
thoroughgoing
reformer
who
be
asking
us
all
to
throw
up
our
hats
for
the
new
charter
the
laughed
contemptuously
i
he
said
god
forbid
the
new
charter
none
of
my
making
it
only
another
dodge
for
getting
round
the
populace
for
appearing
to
give
them
what
they
would
rise
up
and
take
if
it
were
denied
them
any
longer
why
i
thought
you
were
hot
for
these
reforms
exclaimed
the
fat
man
with
surprise
the
other
shrugged
you
might
as
well
say
i
was
in
favour
of
having
the
sun
rise
tomorrow
it
would
probably
rise
at
the
same
hour
if
i
voted
against
it
reform
is
bound
to
come
whether
your
dukes
and
princes
are
for
it
or
against
it
and
those
that
grant
constitutions
instead
of
refusing
them
are
like
men
who
tie
a
string
to
their
hats
before
going
out
in
a
gale
the
string
may
hold
for
a
while
but
if
it
blows
hard
enough
the
hats
will
all
come
off
in
the
end
ay
ay
and
meanwhile
we
furnish
the
string
from
our
own
pockets
said
the
scribe
with
a
chuckle
the
shabby
man
grinned
it
wo
be
the
last
thing
to
come
out
of
your
pockets
said
he
turning
to
push
his
way
toward
another
table
the
others
rose
and
called
for
their
reckoning
and
the
listener
on
the
cask
slipped
out
of
his
corner
elbowed
a
passage
to
the
door
and
stepped
forth
into
the
square
it
was
after
midnight
a
thin
drizzle
was
falling
and
the
crowd
had
scattered
the
rain
was
beginning
to
extinguish
the
paper
lanterns
and
the
torches
and
the
canvas
sides
of
the
tents
flapped
dismally
like
wet
sheets
on
a
the
man
drew
his
cloak
closer
and
avoiding
the
stragglers
who
crossed
his
path
turned
into
the
first
street
that
led
to
the
palace
he
walked
fast
over
the
slippery
buffeted
by
a
rising
wind
and
threading
his
way
between
dark
walls
and
sleeping
till
he
reached
the
lane
below
the
ducal
gardens
he
unlocked
the
door
by
which
he
had
come
forth
entered
the
gardens
and
paused
a
moment
on
the
terrace
above
the
lane
behind
him
rose
the
palace
a
dark
irregular
bulk
with
a
lighted
window
showing
here
and
there
before
him
lay
the
city
an
indistinguishable
huddle
of
roofs
and
towers
under
the
rainy
night
he
stood
awhile
gazing
out
over
it
then
he
turned
and
walked
toward
the
palace
the
garden
alleys
were
deserted
the
pleached
walks
dark
as
subterranean
passages
with
the
wet
gleam
of
statues
starting
spectrally
out
of
the
blackness
the
man
walked
rapidly
leaving
the
borromini
wing
on
his
left
and
skirting
the
outstanding
mass
of
the
older
buildings
behind
the
marble
buttresses
of
the
chapel
he
crossed
the
dense
obscurity
of
a
court
between
high
walls
found
a
door
under
an
archway
turned
a
key
in
the
lock
and
gained
a
spiral
stairway
as
dark
as
the
court
he
groped
his
way
up
the
stairs
and
paused
a
moment
on
the
landing
to
listen
then
he
opened
another
door
lifted
a
heavy
hanging
of
tapestry
and
stepped
into
the
duke
closet
it
stood
empty
with
a
lamp
burning
low
on
the
desk
the
man
threw
off
his
cloak
and
hat
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
the
desk
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
it
was
the
eve
of
the
duke
birthday
a
cabinet
council
had
been
called
in
the
morning
and
his
highness
ministers
had
submitted
to
him
the
revised
draft
of
the
constitution
which
was
to
be
proclaimed
on
the
morrow
throughout
the
conference
which
was
brief
and
formal
odo
had
been
conscious
of
a
subtle
change
in
the
ministerial
atmosphere
instead
of
the
current
of
resistance
against
which
he
had
grown
used
to
forcing
his
way
he
became
aware
of
a
tacit
yielding
to
his
will
trescorre
had
apparently
withdrawn
his
opposition
to
the
charter
and
the
other
ministers
had
followed
suit
to
odo
overwrought
imagination
there
was
something
ominous
in
the
change
he
had
counted
on
the
goad
of
opposition
to
fight
off
the
fatal
languor
which
he
had
learned
to
expect
at
such
crises
now
that
he
found
there
was
to
be
no
struggle
he
understood
how
largely
his
zeal
had
of
late
depended
on
such
factitious
incentives
he
felt
an
irrational
longing
to
throw
himself
on
the
other
side
of
the
conflict
to
tear
in
bits
the
paper
awaiting
his
signature
and
disown
the
policy
which
had
dictated
it
but
the
tide
of
acquiescence
on
which
he
was
afloat
was
no
stagnant
of
indifference
but
the
glassy
reach
just
above
the
fall
of
a
river
the
current
was
as
swift
as
it
was
smooth
and
he
felt
himself
hurried
forward
to
an
end
he
could
no
longer
escape
he
took
the
pen
which
trescorre
handed
him
and
signed
the
constitution
the
meeting
over
he
summoned
gamba
he
felt
the
need
of
such
encouragement
as
the
hunchback
alone
could
give
fulvia
enthusiasms
were
too
unreal
too
abstract
she
lived
in
a
region
of
ideals
whence
ugly
facts
were
swept
out
by
some
process
of
mental
housewifery
which
kept
her
world
perpetually
smiling
and
immaculate
gamba
at
least
fed
his
convictions
on
facts
if
his
outlook
was
narrow
it
was
direct
no
roseate
medium
of
fancy
was
interposed
between
his
vision
and
the
truth
he
stood
listening
thoughtfully
while
odo
poured
forth
his
doubts
your
highness
may
well
hesitate
he
said
at
last
there
are
always
more
good
reasons
against
a
new
state
of
things
than
for
it
i
am
not
surprised
that
count
trescorre
appears
to
have
withdrawn
his
opposition
i
believe
he
now
honestly
wishes
your
highness
to
proclaim
the
constitution
odo
looked
up
in
surprise
you
do
not
mean
that
he
has
come
to
believe
in
it
gamba
smiled
probably
not
in
your
highness
sense
but
he
may
have
found
a
use
of
his
own
for
it
what
do
you
mean
odo
asked
if
he
does
not
believe
it
will
benefit
the
state
he
may
think
it
will
injure
your
highness
ah
said
the
duke
slowly
there
was
a
pause
during
which
he
was
possessed
by
the
same
shuddering
reluctance
to
fix
his
mind
on
the
facts
before
him
as
when
he
had
questioned
the
hunchback
about
momola
death
he
longed
to
cast
the
whole
business
aside
to
be
up
and
away
from
it
drawing
breath
in
a
new
world
where
every
air
was
not
tainted
with
corruption
he
raised
his
head
with
an
effort
you
think
then
that
the
liberals
are
secretly
acting
against
me
in
this
matter
i
am
persuaded
of
it
your
highness
odo
hesitated
you
have
always
told
me
he
began
again
that
the
love
of
dominion
was
your
brother
ruling
passion
if
he
really
believes
this
movement
will
be
popular
with
the
people
why
should
he
secretly
oppose
it
instead
of
making
the
most
of
his
own
share
in
it
as
the
minister
of
a
popular
sovereign
for
several
reasons
gamba
answered
promptly
in
the
first
place
the
reforms
your
highness
has
introduced
are
not
of
his
own
choosing
and
trescorre
has
little
sympathy
with
any
policy
he
has
not
dictated
in
the
second
place
the
powers
and
opportunities
of
a
constitutional
minister
are
too
restricted
to
satisfy
his
appetite
for
rule
and
thirdly
he
paused
a
moment
as
though
doubtful
how
his
words
would
be
received
i
suspect
trescorre
of
having
a
private
score
against
your
highness
which
he
would
be
glad
to
pay
off
publicly
odo
fell
silent
yielding
himself
to
a
fresh
current
of
thought
i
know
not
what
score
he
may
have
against
me
he
said
at
length
but
what
injures
me
must
injure
the
state
and
if
trescorre
has
any
such
motive
for
withdrawing
his
opposition
it
must
be
because
he
believes
the
constitution
will
defeat
its
own
ends
he
does
believe
that
assuredly
but
he
is
not
the
only
one
of
your
highness
ministers
that
would
ruin
the
state
on
the
chance
of
finding
an
opportunity
among
the
ruins
that
is
as
it
may
be
said
odo
with
a
touch
of
weariness
i
have
seen
enough
of
human
ambition
to
learn
how
limited
and
unimaginative
a
passion
it
is
if
it
saw
farther
i
should
fear
it
more
but
if
it
is
it
sees
clearly
at
close
range
and
the
motive
you
ascribe
to
trescorre
would
imply
that
he
believes
the
constitution
will
be
a
failure
without
doubt
your
highness
i
am
convinced
that
your
ministers
have
done
all
they
could
to
prevent
the
proclamation
of
the
charter
and
failing
that
to
thwart
its
workings
if
it
be
proclaimed
in
this
they
have
gone
hand
in
hand
with
the
clergy
and
their
measures
have
been
well
taken
but
i
do
not
believe
that
any
state
of
mind
produced
by
external
influences
can
long
withstand
the
natural
drift
of
opinion
and
your
highness
may
be
sure
that
though
the
talkers
and
writers
are
mostly
against
you
in
this
matter
the
mass
of
the
people
are
with
you
odo
answered
with
a
despairing
gesture
how
can
i
be
sure
when
the
people
have
no
means
of
expressing
their
needs
it
is
like
trying
to
guess
the
wants
of
a
deaf
and
dumb
man
the
hunchback
flushed
suddenly
the
people
will
not
always
be
deaf
and
dumb
he
said
some
day
they
will
speak
not
in
my
day
said
odo
wearily
and
meanwhile
we
blunder
on
without
ever
really
knowing
what
incalculable
instincts
and
prejudices
are
pitted
against
us
you
and
your
party
tell
me
the
people
are
sick
of
the
burdens
the
clergy
lay
on
them
yet
their
blind
devotion
to
the
church
is
manifest
at
every
turn
and
it
did
not
need
the
business
of
the
virgin
crown
to
show
me
how
little
reason
and
justice
can
avail
against
such
influences
gamba
replied
by
an
impatient
gesture
as
to
the
virgin
crown
he
said
your
highness
must
have
guessed
it
was
one
of
the
friars
tricks
a
last
expedient
to
turn
the
people
against
you
i
was
not
bred
up
by
a
priest
for
nothing
i
know
what
past
masters
those
gentry
are
in
raising
ghosts
and
reading
portents
they
know
the
minds
of
the
poor
folk
as
the
herdsman
knows
the
habits
of
his
cattle
and
for
generations
they
have
used
that
knowledge
to
bring
the
people
more
completely
under
their
control
and
what
have
we
to
oppose
to
such
a
power
odo
exclaimed
we
are
fighting
the
battle
of
ideas
against
passions
of
reflection
against
instinct
and
you
have
but
to
look
in
the
human
heart
to
guess
which
side
will
win
in
such
a
struggle
we
have
science
and
truth
and
with
us
you
say
yes
but
the
church
has
love
and
fear
and
tradition
and
the
solidarity
of
nigh
two
thousand
years
of
dominion
gamba
listened
in
respectful
silence
then
he
replied
with
a
faint
smile
all
that
your
highness
says
is
true
but
i
beg
leave
to
relate
to
your
highness
a
tale
which
i
read
lately
in
an
old
book
of
your
library
according
to
this
story
it
appears
that
when
the
early
christians
of
alexandria
set
out
to
destroy
the
pagan
idols
in
the
temples
they
were
seized
with
great
dread
at
sight
of
the
god
serapis
for
even
those
that
did
not
believe
in
the
old
gods
feared
them
and
none
dared
raise
a
hand
against
the
sacred
image
but
suddenly
a
soldier
who
was
bolder
than
the
rest
flung
his
at
the
figure
and
when
it
broke
in
pieces
there
rushed
out
nothing
worse
than
a
great
company
of
the
duke
had
promised
to
visit
fulvia
that
evening
for
several
days
his
state
of
indecision
had
made
him
find
pretexts
for
avoiding
her
but
now
that
the
charter
was
signed
and
he
had
ordered
its
proclamation
he
craved
the
contact
of
her
unwavering
faith
he
found
her
alone
in
the
dusk
of
the
convent
parlour
but
he
had
hardly
crossed
the
threshold
before
he
was
aware
of
an
indefinable
change
in
his
surroundings
she
advanced
with
an
impulsiveness
out
of
harmony
with
the
usual
tranquillity
of
their
meetings
and
he
felt
her
hand
tremble
and
burn
in
his
in
the
twilight
it
seemed
to
him
that
her
very
dress
had
a
warmer
rustle
and
glimmer
that
there
emanated
from
her
glance
and
movements
some
heady
fragrance
of
a
summer
he
smiled
to
think
that
this
phantom
coquetry
should
have
risen
at
the
summons
of
an
academic
degree
but
some
deeper
sense
in
him
was
stirred
as
by
a
vision
of
waste
riches
adrift
on
the
dim
seas
of
chance
for
a
moment
she
sat
silent
as
in
the
days
when
they
had
been
too
near
each
other
for
many
words
and
there
was
something
indescribably
soothing
in
this
dreamlike
return
to
the
past
it
was
he
who
roused
himself
first
how
young
you
look
he
said
giving
involuntary
utterance
to
his
thought
do
i
she
answered
gaily
i
am
glad
of
that
for
i
feel
extraordinarily
young
tonight
perhaps
it
is
because
i
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal
of
the
old
days
of
venice
and
turin
and
of
the
to
vercelli
for
instance
she
glanced
at
him
with
a
smile
do
you
know
she
went
on
moving
to
a
seat
at
his
side
and
laying
a
hand
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
that
there
is
one
secret
of
mine
you
have
never
guessed
in
all
these
years
odo
returned
her
smile
what
is
it
i
wonder
he
said
she
fixed
him
with
bright
bantering
eyes
i
knew
why
you
deserted
us
at
vercelli
he
uttered
an
exclamation
but
she
lifted
a
hand
to
his
lips
ah
how
angry
i
was
then
but
why
be
angry
now
it
all
happened
so
long
ago
and
if
it
had
not
happened
who
knows
perhaps
you
would
never
have
pitied
me
enough
to
love
me
as
you
did
she
laughed
softly
reminiscently
leaning
back
as
if
to
let
the
tide
of
memories
ripple
over
her
then
she
raised
her
head
suddenly
and
said
in
a
changed
voice
are
your
plans
fixed
for
tomorrow
odo
glanced
at
her
in
surprise
her
mind
seemed
to
move
as
capriciously
as
maria
clementina
the
constitution
is
signed
he
answered
and
my
ministers
proclaim
it
tomorrow
morning
he
looked
at
her
a
moment
and
lifted
her
hand
to
his
lips
everything
has
been
done
according
to
your
wishes
he
said
she
drew
away
with
a
start
and
he
saw
that
she
had
turned
pale
no
no
not
as
i
wish
she
murmured
it
must
not
be
because
wish
she
broke
off
and
her
hand
slipped
from
his
you
have
taught
me
to
wish
as
you
wish
he
answered
gently
surely
you
would
not
disown
your
pupil
now
her
agitation
increased
do
not
call
yourself
that
she
exclaimed
not
even
in
jest
what
you
have
done
has
been
done
of
your
own
choice
because
you
thought
it
best
for
your
people
my
nearness
or
absence
could
have
made
no
difference
he
looked
at
her
with
growing
wonder
why
this
sudden
modesty
he
said
with
a
smile
i
thought
you
prided
yourself
on
your
share
in
the
great
work
she
tried
to
force
an
answering
smile
but
the
curve
broke
into
a
quiver
of
distress
and
she
came
close
to
him
with
a
gesture
that
seemed
to
take
flight
from
herself
do
say
it
do
say
it
she
broke
out
what
right
have
they
to
call
it
my
doing
i
but
stood
aside
and
watched
you
and
gloried
in
you
is
there
any
guilt
to
a
woman
in
that
she
clung
to
him
a
moment
hiding
her
face
in
his
breast
he
loosened
her
arms
gently
that
he
might
draw
back
and
look
at
her
fulvia
he
asked
what
ails
you
you
are
not
yourself
tonight
has
anything
happened
to
distress
you
have
you
been
annoyed
or
alarmed
in
any
way
it
is
not
possible
he
broke
off
that
trescorre
has
been
here
she
drew
away
flushed
and
protesting
no
no
she
exclaimed
why
should
trescorre
come
here
why
should
you
fancy
that
any
one
has
been
here
i
am
excited
i
know
i
talk
idly
but
it
is
because
i
have
been
thinking
too
long
of
these
things
of
what
things
of
what
people
say
how
can
one
help
hearing
that
i
sometimes
fancy
that
the
more
withdrawn
one
lives
the
more
distinctly
one
hears
the
outer
noises
but
why
should
you
heed
the
outer
noises
you
have
never
done
so
before
perhaps
i
was
wrong
not
to
do
so
before
perhaps
i
should
have
listened
sooner
perhaps
others
have
seen
understood
sooner
than
i
oh
the
thought
is
intolerable
she
moved
a
pace
or
two
away
and
then
regaining
the
mastery
of
her
lips
and
eyes
turned
to
him
with
a
show
of
calmness
your
heart
was
never
in
this
charter
she
began
fulvia
he
cried
protestingly
but
she
lifted
a
silencing
hand
ah
i
have
seen
it
i
have
felt
it
but
i
was
never
willing
to
own
that
you
were
right
my
pride
in
you
blinded
me
i
suppose
i
could
not
bear
to
dream
any
fate
for
you
but
the
greatest
i
saw
you
always
leading
events
rather
than
waiting
on
them
but
true
greatness
lies
in
the
man
not
in
his
actions
compromise
delay
renunciation
these
may
be
as
heroic
as
conflict
a
woman
vision
is
so
narrow
that
i
did
not
see
this
at
first
you
have
always
told
me
that
i
looked
only
at
one
side
of
the
question
but
i
see
the
other
side
now
i
see
that
you
were
right
odo
stood
silent
he
had
followed
her
with
growing
wonder
a
so
little
in
keeping
with
her
mental
habits
immediately
struck
him
as
a
feint
yet
so
strangely
did
it
accord
with
his
own
secret
reluctances
that
these
inclined
him
to
let
it
pass
unquestioned
some
instinctive
loyalty
to
his
past
checked
the
temptation
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
you
he
said
slowly
have
you
lost
faith
in
the
ideas
we
have
worked
for
she
hesitated
and
he
saw
the
struggle
beneath
her
surface
calmness
no
no
she
exclaimed
quickly
i
have
not
lost
faith
in
them
in
me
then
she
smiled
with
a
disarming
sadness
that
would
be
so
much
simpler
she
murmured
what
do
you
mean
then
he
urged
we
must
understand
each
other
he
paused
and
measured
his
words
out
slowly
do
you
think
it
a
mistake
to
proclaim
the
constitution
tomorrow
again
her
face
was
full
of
shadowy
contradictions
i
entreat
you
not
to
proclaim
it
tomorrow
she
said
in
a
low
voice
odo
felt
the
blood
drum
in
his
ears
was
not
this
the
word
for
which
he
had
waited
but
still
some
deeper
instinct
held
him
back
warning
him
as
it
seemed
that
to
fall
below
his
purpose
at
such
a
juncture
was
the
only
measurable
failure
he
must
know
more
before
he
yielded
see
deeper
into
her
heart
and
his
and
each
moment
brought
the
clearer
conviction
that
there
was
more
to
know
and
see
this
is
unlike
you
fulvia
he
said
you
can
not
make
such
a
request
on
impulse
you
must
have
a
reason
she
smiled
you
told
me
once
that
a
woman
reasons
are
only
impulses
in
men
clothes
but
he
was
not
to
be
diverted
by
this
thrust
i
shall
think
so
now
he
said
unless
you
can
give
me
some
better
account
of
yours
she
was
silent
and
he
pressed
on
with
a
persistency
for
which
he
himself
could
hardly
account
you
must
have
a
reason
for
this
request
i
have
one
she
said
dropping
her
attempts
at
evasion
and
it
is
she
paused
again
with
a
look
of
appeal
against
which
he
had
to
stiffen
himself
i
do
not
believe
the
time
has
come
she
said
at
length
you
think
the
people
are
not
ready
for
the
constitution
she
answered
with
an
effort
i
think
the
people
are
not
ready
for
it
he
fell
silent
and
they
sat
facing
each
other
but
with
eyes
apart
you
have
received
this
impression
from
gamba
from
andreoni
from
the
members
of
our
party
he
asked
she
made
no
reply
remember
fulvia
he
went
on
almost
sternly
that
this
is
the
end
for
which
we
have
worked
together
all
these
years
the
end
for
which
we
renounced
each
other
and
went
forth
in
our
youth
you
to
exile
and
i
to
an
unwilling
sovereignty
it
was
because
we
loved
this
cause
better
than
ourselves
that
we
had
strength
to
give
up
for
it
our
personal
hopes
of
happiness
if
we
betray
the
cause
from
any
merely
personal
motive
we
shall
have
fallen
below
our
earlier
selves
he
waited
again
but
she
was
still
silent
can
you
swear
to
me
he
went
on
that
no
such
motive
influences
you
now
that
you
honestly
believe
we
have
been
deceived
and
mistaken
that
our
years
of
faith
and
labour
have
been
wasted
and
that
if
mankind
is
to
be
helped
it
is
to
be
in
other
ways
and
by
other
efforts
than
ours
he
stood
before
her
accusingly
almost
the
passion
of
the
long
fight
surging
up
in
him
as
he
felt
the
weapon
drop
from
his
hand
fulvia
had
sat
motionless
under
his
appeal
but
as
he
paused
she
rose
with
an
impulsive
gesture
oh
why
do
you
torment
me
with
questions
she
cried
i
venture
to
counsel
a
delay
and
you
arraign
me
as
though
i
stood
at
the
day
of
judgment
it
is
our
day
of
judgment
he
retorted
it
is
the
day
on
which
life
confronts
us
with
our
own
actions
and
we
must
justify
them
or
own
ourselves
deluded
he
went
up
to
her
and
caught
her
hands
entreatingly
fulvia
he
said
i
too
have
doubted
wavered
and
if
you
will
give
me
one
honest
reason
that
is
worthy
of
us
both
she
broke
from
him
to
hide
her
weeping
reasons
reasons
she
stammered
what
does
the
heart
know
of
reasons
i
ask
a
favour
the
first
i
ever
asked
of
you
and
you
answer
it
by
haggling
with
me
for
reasons
something
in
her
voice
and
gesture
was
like
a
over
a
dark
landscape
in
an
instant
he
saw
the
pit
at
his
feet
some
one
has
been
with
you
those
words
were
not
yours
he
cried
she
rallied
instantly
that
is
a
pretext
for
not
heeding
them
she
returned
the
lightning
glared
again
he
stepped
close
and
faced
her
the
duchess
has
been
here
he
said
she
dropped
into
a
chair
and
hid
her
face
from
him
a
wave
of
anger
mounted
from
his
heart
choking
back
his
words
and
filling
his
brain
with
its
fumes
but
as
it
subsided
he
felt
himself
suddenly
cool
firm
attempered
there
could
be
no
wavering
no
now
when
did
this
happen
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
despairingly
fulvia
he
said
if
you
will
not
speak
i
will
speak
for
you
i
can
guess
what
arguments
were
used
what
threats
even
were
there
threats
burst
from
him
in
a
fresh
leap
of
anger
she
raised
her
head
slowly
threats
would
not
have
mattered
she
said
but
your
fears
were
played
on
your
fears
for
my
safety
fulvia
answer
me
he
insisted
she
rose
suddenly
and
laid
her
arms
about
his
shoulders
with
a
gesture
oh
she
said
why
will
you
torture
me
i
have
borne
much
for
our
love
sake
and
would
have
borne
this
too
in
silence
like
the
rest
but
to
speak
of
it
is
to
relieve
it
and
my
strength
fails
me
he
held
her
hands
fast
keeping
his
eyes
on
hers
no
he
said
for
your
strength
never
failed
you
when
there
was
any
call
on
it
and
our
whole
past
calls
on
it
now
rouse
yourself
fulvia
look
life
in
the
face
you
were
told
there
might
be
troubles
tomorrow
that
i
was
in
danger
perhaps
there
was
worse
there
was
worse
she
shuddered
worse
the
blame
was
laid
on
me
the
responsibility
your
love
for
me
my
power
over
you
were
accused
the
people
hate
me
they
hate
you
for
loving
me
oh
i
have
destroyed
you
she
cried
odo
felt
a
slow
cold
strength
pouring
into
all
his
veins
it
was
as
though
his
enemies
in
thinking
to
mix
a
mortal
poison
had
rendered
him
invulnerable
he
bent
over
her
with
great
gentleness
fulvia
this
is
madness
he
said
a
moment
thought
must
show
you
what
passions
are
here
at
work
can
you
not
rise
above
such
fears
no
one
can
judge
between
us
but
ourselves
ah
but
you
do
not
know
you
will
not
understand
your
life
may
be
in
danger
she
cried
i
have
been
told
that
before
he
said
contemptuously
it
is
a
common
trick
of
the
political
game
this
is
no
trick
she
exclaimed
i
was
made
to
see
to
understand
and
i
swear
to
you
that
the
danger
is
real
and
what
if
it
were
is
the
church
to
have
all
the
martyrs
said
he
gaily
come
fulvia
shake
off
such
fancies
my
life
is
as
safe
as
yours
at
worst
there
may
be
a
little
hissing
to
be
faced
that
is
easy
enough
compared
to
facing
one
own
doubts
and
i
have
no
doubts
now
that
is
all
past
thank
heaven
i
see
the
road
straight
before
me
as
straight
as
when
you
showed
it
to
me
once
before
years
ago
in
the
at
peschiera
you
pointed
the
way
to
it
then
surely
you
would
not
hold
me
back
from
it
now
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
lips
to
silence
when
we
meet
tomorrow
he
said
releasing
her
it
will
be
as
teacher
and
pupil
you
in
your
doctor
gown
and
i
a
learner
at
your
feet
put
your
old
faith
in
me
into
your
argument
and
we
shall
have
all
pianura
converted
he
hastened
away
through
the
dim
gardens
carrying
a
boy
heart
in
his
breast
the
university
of
pianura
was
lodged
in
the
ancient
signoria
or
town
hall
of
the
free
city
and
here
on
the
afternoon
of
the
birthday
the
civic
dignitaries
and
the
leading
men
of
the
learned
professions
had
assembled
to
see
the
doctorate
conferred
on
the
signorina
fulvia
vivaldi
and
on
several
less
conspicuous
candidates
of
the
other
sex
the
city
was
again
in
gala
dress
early
that
morning
the
new
constitution
had
been
proclaimed
with
much
firing
of
cannon
and
display
of
official
fireworks
but
even
these
great
news
and
their
attendant
manifestations
had
failed
to
enliven
the
populace
who
instead
of
filling
the
streets
with
their
usual
stir
hung
massed
at
certain
points
as
though
curiously
waiting
on
events
there
are
few
sights
more
ominous
than
that
of
a
crowd
thus
observing
itself
watching
in
inconscient
suspense
for
the
unknown
crisis
which
its
own
passions
have
engendered
it
was
known
that
his
highness
after
the
public
banquet
at
the
palace
was
to
proceed
in
state
to
the
university
and
the
throng
was
thick
about
the
palace
gates
and
in
the
streets
betwixt
it
and
the
signoria
here
the
square
was
and
every
window
choked
with
gazers
as
the
duke
coach
came
in
sight
escorted
meagrely
by
his
equerries
and
the
that
preceded
him
the
small
escort
and
the
marked
absence
of
military
display
perhaps
disappointed
the
crowd
and
from
this
cause
or
another
scarce
a
cheer
was
heard
as
his
highness
descended
from
his
coach
and
walked
up
the
steps
to
the
porch
of
ancient
carved
stone
where
the
faculty
awaited
him
the
hall
was
already
filled
with
students
and
graduates
and
with
the
guests
of
the
university
through
this
grave
assemblage
the
duke
passed
up
to
the
row
of
armchairs
beneath
the
dais
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
trescorre
who
was
to
have
attended
his
highness
had
excused
himself
on
the
plea
of
indisposition
and
only
a
few
accompanied
the
duke
but
in
the
brown
of
the
old
gothic
hall
their
glittering
uniforms
contrasted
brilliantly
with
the
black
gowns
of
the
students
and
the
sober
broadcloth
of
the
learned
professions
a
discreet
murmur
of
enthusiasm
rose
at
their
approach
mounting
almost
to
a
cheer
as
the
duke
bowed
before
taking
his
seat
for
the
audience
represented
the
class
most
in
sympathy
with
his
policy
and
most
confident
of
its
success
the
meetings
of
the
faculty
were
held
in
the
great
where
the
rectors
of
the
old
free
city
had
assembled
and
such
a
setting
was
regarded
as
peculiarly
appropriate
to
the
present
occasion
the
fact
was
alluded
to
with
much
wealth
of
historical
and
mythological
analogy
by
the
president
who
opened
the
ceremonies
with
a
polysyllabic
latin
oration
in
which
the
duke
was
compared
to
apollo
hercules
and
jason
as
well
as
to
the
flower
of
sublunary
heroes
this
feat
of
rhetoric
over
the
candidates
were
called
on
to
advance
and
receive
their
degrees
the
men
came
first
profiting
by
the
momentary
advantage
of
sex
but
clearly
aware
of
its
inability
to
confer
even
momentary
importance
in
the
eyes
of
the
impatient
audience
a
pause
followed
and
then
fulvia
appeared
against
the
faculty
at
the
back
of
the
dais
she
stood
tall
and
slender
in
her
black
cap
and
gown
the
high
windows
of
painted
glass
shed
a
paleness
on
her
face
but
her
carriage
was
light
and
assured
as
she
advanced
to
the
president
and
knelt
to
receive
her
degree
the
parchment
was
placed
in
her
hand
the
furred
hood
laid
on
her
shoulders
then
after
another
flourish
of
rhetoric
she
was
led
to
the
lectern
from
which
her
discourse
was
to
be
delivered
odo
sat
just
below
her
and
as
she
took
her
place
their
eyes
met
for
an
instant
he
was
caught
up
in
the
serene
exaltation
of
her
look
as
though
she
soared
with
him
above
wind
and
cloud
to
a
region
of
unshadowed
calm
then
her
eyes
fell
and
she
began
to
speak
she
had
a
pretty
mastery
of
latin
and
though
she
had
never
before
spoken
in
public
her
poetical
recitations
and
the
early
habit
of
intercourse
with
her
father
friends
had
given
her
a
fair
measure
of
fluency
and
these
qualities
were
raised
to
eloquence
by
the
sweetness
of
her
voice
and
by
the
grave
beauty
which
made
the
academic
gown
seem
her
natural
wear
rather
than
a
travesty
of
learning
odo
at
first
had
some
difficulty
in
fixing
his
attention
on
what
she
said
and
when
he
controlled
his
thoughts
she
was
in
the
height
of
her
panegyric
of
constitutional
liberty
she
had
begun
slowly
almost
coldly
but
now
her
theme
possessed
her
one
by
one
she
evoked
the
familiar
formulas
with
which
his
mind
had
once
reverberated
they
woke
no
echo
in
him
now
but
he
saw
that
she
could
still
set
them
ringing
through
the
sensibilities
of
her
hearers
as
she
stood
there
a
slight
impassioned
figure
warming
to
her
high
argument
his
sense
of
irony
was
touched
by
the
incongruity
of
her
background
the
wall
behind
her
was
covered
by
an
ancient
fresco
fast
fading
under
its
touches
of
renewed
gilding
and
representing
the
patron
scholars
of
the
mediaeval
world
the
theologians
and
logicians
under
whose
protection
the
free
city
had
placed
its
budding
liberties
there
they
sat
rigid
and
sumptuous
on
their
gothic
thrones
origen

david

aristotle
listening
in
a
kind
of
cataleptic
helplessness
to
a
confession
of
faith
that
scattered
their
doctrines
to
the
winds
as
he
looked
and
listened
a
weary
sense
of
the
reiterance
of
things
came
over
him
for
what
were
these
ancient
manipulators
of
ideas
prestidigitators
of
a
vanished
world
of
thought
but
the
forbears
of
the
long
line
of
theorists
of
whom
fulvia
was
the
last
inconscient
mouthpiece
the
new
game
was
still
played
with
the
old
counters
the
new
jugglers
repeated
the
old
tricks
and
the
very
words
now
poured
out
in
defence
of
the
new
cause
were
but
mercenaries
scarred
in
the
service
of
its
enemies
for
generations
for
centuries
man
had
fought
on
crying
for
liberty
dreaming
it
was
won
waking
to
find
himself
the
slave
of
the
new
forces
he
had
generated
burning
and
being
burnt
for
the
same
beliefs
under
different
guises
calling
his
instinct
ideas
and
his
ideas
revelations
destroying
rebuilding
falling
rising
mending
broken
weapons
championing
extinct
illusions
mistaking
his
failures
for
achievements
and
planting
his
flag
on
the
ramparts
as
they
fell
and
as
the
vision
of
this
inveterate
conflict
rose
before
him
odo
saw
that
the
beauty
the
power
the
immortality
dwelt
not
in
the
idea
but
in
the
struggle
for
it
his
resistance
yielded
as
this
sense
stole
over
him
and
with
an
almost
physical
relief
he
felt
himself
drawn
once
more
into
the
familiar
current
of
emotion
yes
it
was
better
after
all
to
be
one
of
that
great
unconquerable
army
though
like
the
trojans
fighting
for
a
phantom
helen
they
might
be
doing
battle
for
the
shadow
of
a
shade
better
to
march
in
their
ranks
endure
with
them
fight
with
them
fall
with
them
than
to
miss
the
great
enveloping
sense
of
brotherhood
that
turned
defeat
to
victory
as
the
conviction
grew
in
him
fulvia
words
regained
their
lost
significance
through
the
set
mask
of
language
the
living
thoughts
looked
forth
old
indeed
as
the
world
but
renewed
with
the
new
life
of
every
heart
that
bore
them
she
had
left
the
abstract
and
dropped
to
concrete
issues
to
the
gift
of
the
constitution
the
benefits
and
obligations
it
implied
the
new
relations
it
established
between
ruler
and
subject
and
between
man
and
man
odo
saw
that
she
approached
the
question
without
flinching
no
trace
remained
of
the
trembling
woman
who
had
clung
to
him
the
night
before
her
old
convictions
repossessed
her
and
she
soared
above
human
fears
so
engrossed
was
he
that
he
had
been
unaware
of
a
growing
murmur
of
sound
which
seemed
to
be
forcing
its
way
from
without
through
the
walls
of
the
ancient
building
as
fulvia
oration
neared
its
end
the
murmur
rose
to
a
roar
startled
faces
were
turned
toward
the
doors
of
the
and
one
of
the
duke
gentlemen
left
his
seat
and
made
his
way
through
the
audience
odo
sat
motionless
his
eyes
on
fulvia
he
noticed
that
her
face
paled
as
the
sound
reached
her
but
there
was
no
break
in
the
voice
with
which
she
uttered
the
closing
words
of
her
peroration
as
she
ended
the
noise
was
momentarily
drowned
under
a
loud
burst
of
clapping
but
this
died
in
a
hush
of
apprehension
through
which
the
outer
tumult
became
more
ominously
audible
the
equerry
reentered
the
hall
with
a
disordered
countenance
he
hastened
to
the
duke
and
addressed
him
urgently
your
highness
he
said
the
crowd
has
thickened
and
wears
an
ugly
look
there
are
many
friars
abroad
and
images
of
the
mountain
virgin
are
being
carried
in
procession
will
your
highness
be
pleased
to
remain
here
while
i
summon
an
escort
from
the
barracks
odo
was
still
watching
fulvia
she
had
received
the
applause
of
the
audience
with
a
deep
reverence
and
was
now
in
the
act
of
withdrawing
to
the
inner
room
at
the
back
of
the
dais
her
eyes
met
odo
she
smiled
and
the
door
closed
on
her
he
turned
to
the
equerry
there
is
no
need
of
an
escort
he
said
i
trust
my
people
if
they
do
not
trust
me
but
your
highness
the
streets
are
full
of
demagogues
who
have
been
haranguing
the
people
since
morning
the
crowd
is
shouting
against
the
constitution
and
against
the
signorina
vivaldi
a
flame
of
anger
passed
over
the
duke
face
but
he
subdued
it
instantly
go
to
the
signorina
vivaldi
he
said
pointing
to
the
door
by
which
fulvia
had
left
the
hall
assure
her
that
there
is
no
danger
but
ask
her
to
remain
where
she
is
till
the
crowd
disperses
and
request
the
faculty
in
my
name
to
remain
with
her
the
equerry
bowed
and
hurried
up
the
steps
of
the
dais
while
the
duke
signed
to
his
other
companions
to
precede
him
to
the
door
of
the
hall
as
they
walked
down
the
long
room
between
the
ranks
of
the
audience
the
outer
tumult
surged
threateningly
toward
them
near
the
doorway
another
of
the
was
seen
to
speak
with
the
duke
your
highness
he
said
there
is
a
private
way
at
the
back
by
which
you
may
yet
leave
the
building
unobserved
you
appear
to
forget
that
i
entered
it
publicly
said
odo
but
your
highness
we
can
not
answer
for
the
consequences
the
duke
signed
to
the
ushers
to
throw
open
the
doors
they
obeyed
and
he
stepped
out
into
the
stone
vestibule
preceding
the
porch
the
outer
doors
of
this
vestibule
were
securely
bolted
and
the
porter
hung
back
in
affright
at
the
order
to
unlock
them
your
highness
the
people
are
raving
mad
he
said
flinging
himself
on
his
knees
odo
turned
impatiently
to
his
escort
unbar
the
doors
gentlemen
he
said
the
blood
was
drumming
in
his
ears
but
his
eye
was
clear
and
steady
and
he
noted
with
curious
detachment
the
comic
agony
of
the
fat
porter
face
and
the
strain
and
swell
of
the
equerry
muscles
as
he
dragged
back
the
ponderous
bolts
the
doors
swung
open
and
the
duke
emerged
below
him
still
with
that
unimpaired
distinctness
of
vision
which
seemed
a
part
of
his
heightened
vitality
he
saw
a
great
gesticulating
mass
of
people
they
packed
the
square
so
closely
that
their
own
numbers
held
them
immovable
save
for
their
swaying
arms
and
heads
and
those
whom
the
square
could
not
contain
had
climbed
to
porticoes
balconies
and
cornices
and
massed
themselves
in
the
neck
of
the
adjoining
streets
the
handful
of
who
had
escorted
the
duke
carriage
formed
a
single
line
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
so
that
the
approach
to
the
porch
was
still
clear
but
it
was
plain
that
the
crowd
with
its
next
movement
would
break
through
this
slender
barrier
and
hem
in
the
duke
at
odo
appearance
the
shouting
had
ceased
and
every
eye
was
turned
on
him
he
stood
there
a
brilliant
target
in
his
laced
coat
of
velvet
his
breast
covered
with
orders
a
hand
on
his
jewelled
for
a
moment
sovereign
and
subjects
measured
each
other
and
in
that
moment
odo
drank
his
deepest
draught
of
life
he
was
not
thinking
now
of
the
constitution
or
its
opponents
his
present
business
was
to
get
down
the
steps
and
into
the
carriage
returning
to
the
palace
as
openly
as
he
had
come
he
was
conscious
of
neither
pity
nor
hatred
for
the
throng
in
his
path
for
the
moment
he
regarded
them
merely
as
a
natural
force
to
be
fought
against
like
storm
or
flood
his
clearest
sensation
was
one
of
relief
at
having
at
last
some
material
obstacle
to
spend
his
strength
against
instead
of
the
impalpable
powers
which
had
so
long
beset
him
he
felt
too
a
boyish
satisfaction
at
his
own
steadiness
of
pulse
and
eye
at
the
absence
of
that
fatal
inertia
which
he
had
come
to
dread
so
clear
was
his
mental
horizon
that
it
embraced
not
only
the
present
crisis
but
a
dozen
incidents
leading
up
to
it
he
remembered
that
trescorre
had
urged
him
to
take
a
larger
escort
and
that
he
had
refused
on
the
ground
that
any
military
display
might
imply
a
doubt
of
his
people
he
was
glad
now
that
he
had
done
so
he
would
have
hated
to
slink
to
his
carriage
behind
a
barrier
of
drawn
swords
he
wanted
no
help
to
see
him
through
this
business
the
blood
sang
in
his
veins
at
the
thought
of
facing
it
alone
the
silence
lasted
but
a
moment
then
an
image
of
the
mountain
virgin
was
suddenly
thrust
in
air
and
a
voice
cried
out
down
with
our
enemies
we
want
no
laws
against
the
friars
a
howl
caught
up
the
words
and
tossed
them
to
and
fro
above
the
seething
heads
images
of
the
virgin
religious
banners
the
of
the
madonna
colours
suddenly
canopied
the
crowd
we
want
the
barnabites
back
sang
out
another
voice
down
with
the
yelled
a
hundred
angry
throats
a
stone
or
two
sped
through
the
air
and
struck
the
sculptures
of
the
porch
your
highness
cried
the
equerry
who
stood
nearest
and
would
have
snatched
the
duke
back
within
doors
for
all
answer
odo
stepped
clear
of
the
porch
and
advanced
to
the
edge
of
the
steps
as
he
did
so
a
shower
of
missiles
hummed
about
him
and
a
stone
struck
him
on
the
lip
the
blood
rushed
to
his
head
and
he
swayed
in
the
sudden
grip
of
anger
but
he
mastered
himself
and
raised
his
lace
handkerchief
to
the
cut
his
gentlemen
had
drawn
their
swords
but
he
signed
to
them
to
sheathe
again
his
first
thought
was
that
he
must
somehow
make
the
people
hear
him
he
lifted
his
hand
and
advanced
a
step
but
as
he
did
so
a
shot
rang
out
followed
by
a
loud
cry
the
lieutenant
of
the
infuriated
by
the
insult
to
his
master
had
drawn
the
pistol
from
his
holster
and
fired
blindly
into
the
crowd
his
bullet
had
found
a
mark
and
the
throng
hissed
and
seethed
about
the
spot
where
a
man
had
fallen
at
the
same
instant
odo
was
aware
of
a
commotion
in
the
group
behind
him
and
with
a
great
plunge
of
the
heart
he
saw
fulvia
at
his
side
she
still
wore
the
academic
dress
and
her
black
gown
detached
itself
sharply
against
the
bright
colours
of
the
ducal
uniforms
groans
and
hisses
received
her
but
the
mob
hung
back
as
though
her
look
had
checked
them
then
a
voice
shrieked
out
down
with
the
atheist
we
want
no
foreign
witches
and
another
caught
it
up
with
the
yell
she
poisoned
the
weaver
boy
her
father
was
hanged
for
murdering
christian
children
the
cry
set
the
crowd
in
motion
again
and
it
rolled
toward
the
line
of
mounted
soldiers
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
the
men
had
their
hands
on
their
holsters
but
the
duke
call
rang
out
no
firing
and
drawing
their
blades
they
sat
motionless
to
receive
the
shock
it
came
dashed
against
them
and
dispersed
them
only
a
few
yards
lay
now
between
the
people
and
their
sovereign
but
at
that
moment
another
shot
was
fired
this
time
it
came
from
the
thick
of
the
crowd
the
equerries
swords
leapt
forth
again
and
they
closed
around
the
duke
and
fulvia
save
yourself
sir
back
into
the
building
one
of
the
gentlemen
shouted
but
odo
had
no
eyes
for
what
was
coming
for
as
the
shot
was
heard
he
had
seen
a
change
in
fulvia
a
moment
they
had
stood
together
smiling
undaunted
hands
locked
and
wedded
eyes
then
he
felt
her
dissolve
against
him
and
drop
between
his
arms
a
cry
had
gone
out
that
the
duke
was
wounded
and
a
leaden
silence
fell
on
the
crowd
in
that
silence
odo
knelt
lifting
fulvia
head
to
his
breast
no
wound
showed
through
her
black
gown
she
lay
as
though
smitten
by
some
invisible
hand
so
deep
was
the
hush
that
her
least
whisper
must
have
reached
him
but
though
he
bent
close
no
whisper
came
the
invisible
hand
had
struck
the
very
source
of
life
and
to
these
two
in
their
moment
of
final
reunion
with
so
much
unsaid
between
them
that
now
at
last
they
longed
to
say
there
was
left
only
the
dumb
communion
of
eyes
a
clatter
of
cavalry
was
heard
down
the
streets
that
led
to
the
square
the
equerry
sent
to
warn
fulvia
had
escaped
from
the
back
of
the
building
and
hastened
to
the
barracks
to
summon
a
regiment
but
the
soldiery
were
no
longer
needed
the
blind
fury
of
the
mob
had
died
of
its
own
excess
the
rumour
that
the
duke
was
hurt
brought
a
chill
reaction
of
dismay
and
the
rioters
were
already
scattering
when
the
cavalry
came
in
sight
their
approach
turned
the
slow
dispersal
to
a
stampede
a
few
arrests
were
made
the
remaining
groups
were
charged
by
the
soldiers
and
presently
the
square
lay
bare
as
a
plain
though
the
people
still
hung
on
its
outskirts
ready
to
disband
at
the
first
threat
of
the
troops
it
was
on
this
solitude
that
the
duke
looked
out
as
he
regained
a
sense
of
his
surroundings
fulvia
had
been
carried
into
the
and
laid
on
the
dais
her
head
resting
on
the
velvet
cushions
of
the
ducal
chair
she
had
died
instantly
shot
through
the
heart
and
the
surgeons
summoned
in
haste
had
soon
ceased
from
their
ineffectual
efforts
for
a
long
time
odo
knelt
beside
her
unconscious
of
all
but
that
one
wild
moment
when
life
at
its
highest
had
been
dashed
into
the
gulf
of
death
thought
had
ceased
and
neither
rage
nor
grief
moved
as
yet
across
the
chaos
of
his
being
all
his
life
was
in
his
eyes
as
they
drew
up
drop
by
drop
the
precious
essence
of
her
loveliness
for
she
had
grown
beneath
the
simplifying
hand
of
death
strangely
yet
most
humanly
beautiful
life
had
fallen
from
her
like
the
husk
from
the
flower
and
she
wore
the
face
of
her
first
hopes
the
transition
had
been
too
swift
for
any
backward
look
any
anguished
rending
of
the
fibres
and
he
felt
himself
not
detached
by
the
stroke
but
caught
up
with
her
into
some
great
calm
within
the
heart
of
change
he
knew
not
how
he
found
himself
once
more
on
the
steps
above
the
square
below
him
his
state
carriage
stood
in
the
same
place
flanked
by
the
regiment
of
cavalry
down
the
narrow
streets
he
saw
the
brooding
cloud
of
people
and
the
sight
roused
his
blood
they
were
his
enemies
now
he
felt
the
warm
hate
in
his
veins
they
were
his
enemies
and
he
would
face
them
openly
no
closed
chariot
guarded
by
troops
he
would
not
have
so
much
as
a
pane
of
glass
between
himself
and
his
subjects
he
descended
the
steps
bade
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
dismount
and
sprang
into
his
saddle
then
at
the
head
of
his
soldiers
at
a
he
rode
back
through
the
packed
streets
to
the
palace
in
the
palace
courtyard
and
vestibule
were
thronged
with
courtiers
and
lacqueys
he
walked
through
them
with
his
head
high
the
cut
on
his
lip
like
the
mark
of
a
hot
iron
in
the
dead
whiteness
of
his
face
at
the
head
of
the
great
staircase
maria
clementina
waited
she
sprang
forward
distraught
and
trembling
her
face
as
blanched
as
his
you
are
safe
you
are
safe
you
are
not
hurt
she
stammered
catching
at
his
hands
a
shudder
seized
him
as
he
put
her
aside
odo
odo
she
cried
passionately
and
made
as
though
to
bar
his
way
he
gave
her
a
blind
look
and
passed
on
down
the
long
gallery
to
his
closet
the
joy
of
reprisals
lasted
no
longer
than
a
summer
storm
to
hurt
to
silence
to
destroy
was
too
easy
to
be
satisfying
the
passions
of
his
ancestors
burned
low
in
odo
breast
though
he
felt
bracciaforte
fury
in
his
veins
he
could
taste
no
answering
gratification
of
revenge
and
the
spirit
on
which
he
would
have
spent
his
hatred
was
not
here
or
there
as
an
embodied
faction
but
everywhere
as
an
intangible
influence
the
acqua
tofana
of
his
enemies
had
pervaded
every
fibre
of
the
state
the
mist
of
anguish
lifted
he
saw
himself
alone
among
ruins
for
a
moment
fulvia
glowing
faith
had
hung
between
him
and
a
final
vision
of
the
truth
and
as
his
convictions
weakened
he
had
replaced
them
with
an
immense
pity
an
hope
sentimental
verbiage
he
saw
it
clearly
now
he
had
been
the
dupe
of
the
old
which
was
forever
confounding
fact
and
fancy
in
men
minds
for
it
was
essentially
an
age
of
words
the
world
was
drunk
with
them
as
it
had
once
been
drunk
with
action
and
the
former
was
the
deadlier
drug
of
the
two
he
looked
about
him
languidly
letting
the
facts
of
life
filter
slowly
through
his
faculties
the
sources
of
energy
were
so
benumbed
in
him
that
he
felt
like
a
man
whom
long
disease
had
reduced
to
helplessness
and
who
must
laboriously
begin
his
bodily
education
again
hate
was
the
only
passion
which
survived
and
that
was
but
a
deaf
intransitive
emotion
coiled
in
his
nature
depths
sickness
at
last
brought
its
obliteration
he
sank
into
gulfs
of
weakness
and
oblivion
and
when
the
rise
of
the
tide
floated
him
back
to
life
it
was
to
a
life
as
faint
and
colourless
as
infancy
colourless
too
were
the
boundaries
on
which
he
looked
out
the
narrow
enclosure
of
white
walls
opening
on
a
slit
of
pale
spring
landscape
his
hands
lay
before
him
white
and
helpless
on
the
white
coverlet
of
his
bed
he
raised
his
eyes
and
saw
de
crucis
at
his
side
then
he
began
to
remember
there
had
been
preceding
intervals
of
consciousness
and
in
one
of
them
in
answer
perhaps
to
some
wish
for
light
and
air
he
had
been
carried
out
of
the
palace
and
the
city
to
the
benedictine
monastery
on
its
wooded
knoll
beyond
the
piana
then
the
veil
had
dropped
again
and
his
spirit
had
wandered
in
a
dim
place
of
shades
there
was
a
faint
sweetness
in
coming
back
at
last
to
familiar
sights
and
sounds
they
no
longer
hurt
like
pressure
on
an
aching
nerve
they
seemed
rather
now
the
touch
of
a
reassuring
hand
as
the
contact
with
life
became
closer
and
more
sustained
he
began
to
watch
himself
curiously
wondering
what
instincts
and
habits
of
thought
would
survive
his
long
mental
death
it
was
with
a
bitter
almost
pitiable
disappointment
that
he
found
the
old
man
growing
again
in
him
life
with
a
mocking
hand
brought
him
the
vesture
of
his
past
and
he
felt
himself
gradually
compressed
again
into
the
old
passions
and
prejudices
yet
he
wore
them
with
a
difference
they
were
a
cramping
garment
rather
than
a
living
sheath
he
had
brought
back
from
his
lonely
voyagings
a
sense
of
estrangement
deeper
than
any
with
things
as
his
physical
strength
returned
and
he
was
able
to
leave
his
room
and
walk
through
the
long
corridors
to
the
outer
air
he
felt
the
old
spell
which
the
life
of
monte
cassino
had
cast
on
him
the
quiet
garden
with
its
clumps
of
box
and
lavender
between
paths
converging
to
the
statue
of
saint
benedict
the
cloisters
paved
with
the
monks
nameless
graves
the
traces
of
devotional
painting
left
here
and
there
on
the
walls
like
fragments
of
prayer
in
a
mind
these
formed
a
circle
of
tranquillising
influences
in
which
he
could
gradually
reacquire
the
habit
of
living
he
had
never
deceived
himself
as
to
the
cause
of
the
riots
he
knew
from
gamba
and
andreoni
that
the
liberals
and
the
court
for
once
working
in
unison
had
provoked
the
blind
outburst
of
fanaticism
which
a
rasher
judgment
might
have
ascribed
to
the
clergy
the
dominicans
bigoted
and
eager
for
power
had
been
ready
enough
to
serve
such
an
end
and
some
of
the
begging
orders
had
furnished
the
necessary
points
of
contact
with
the
people
but
the
movement
was
at
bottom
purely
political
and
represented
the
resistance
of
the
privileged
classes
to
any
attack
on
their
inherited
rights
as
such
he
could
no
longer
regard
it
as
completely
unreasonable
he
was
beginning
to
feel
the
social
and
political
significance
of
those
old
restrictions
and
barriers
against
which
his
early
zeal
had
tilted
certainly
in
the
ideal
state
the
rights
and
obligations
of
the
different
classes
would
be
more
evenly
adjusted
but
the
ideal
state
was
a
figment
of
the
brain
the
real
one
as
crescenti
had
long
ago
pointed
out
was
the
gradual
and
heterogeneous
product
of
remote
social
conditions
wherein
every
seeming
inconsistency
had
its
roots
in
some
bygone
need
and
the
character
of
each
class
with
its
special
passions
ignorances
and
prejudices
was
the
sum
total
of
influences
so
ingrown
and
inveterate
that
they
had
become
a
law
of
thought
all
this
however
seemed
rather
matter
for
philosophic
musing
than
for
definite
action
his
predominant
feeling
was
still
that
of
remoteness
from
the
immediate
issues
of
life
the
soeva
indignatio
had
been
succeeded
by
a
great
calm
the
soothing
influences
of
the
monastic
life
had
doubtless
helped
to
tide
him
over
the
stormy
passage
of
returning
consciousness
his
sensitiveness
to
these
influences
inclined
him
for
the
first
time
to
consider
them
analytically
hitherto
he
had
regarded
the
church
as
a
engine
the
product
of
human
passions
scientifically
combined
to
obtain
the
greatest
sum
of
tangible
results
now
he
saw
that
he
had
never
penetrated
beneath
the
surface
for
the
church
which
grasped
contrived
calculated
struggled
for
temporal
possessions
and
used
material
weapons
against
spiritual
foes
this
outer
church
was
nothing
more
than
the
body
which
like
any
other
animal
body
had
to
care
for
its
own
gross
needs
nourish
clothe
defend
itself
fight
for
a
footing
among
the
material
resistances
of
life
while
the
soul
the
inner
animating
principle
might
dwell
aloof
from
all
these
things
in
a
clear
medium
of
its
own
to
this
soul
of
the
church
his
daily
life
now
brought
him
close
he
felt
it
in
the
ordered
beneficence
of
the
great
community
in
the
simplicity
of
its
external
life
and
the
richness
and
suavity
of
its
inner
relations
no
alliance
based
on
material
interests
no
love
of
power
working
toward
a
common
end
could
have
created
that
harmony
of
thought
and
act
which
was
reflected
in
every
face
about
him
each
of
these
men
seemed
to
have
found
out
something
of
which
he
was
still
ignorant
what
it
was
de
crucis
tried
to
tell
him
as
they
paced
the
cloisters
together
or
sat
in
the
warm
stillness
of
the
budding
garden
at
the
first
news
of
the
duke
illness
the
jesuit
had
hastened
to
pianura
no
companionship
could
have
been
so
satisfying
to
odo
de
crucis
mental
attitude
toward
mankind
might
have
been
defined
as
an
illuminated
charity
to
love
men
or
to
understand
them
is
not
as
unusual
as
to
do
both
together
and
it
was
the
intellectual
acuteness
of
his
judgments
that
made
their
christian
amenity
so
seductive
to
odo
the
highest
claim
of
christianity
the
jesuit
said
one
morning
as
they
sat
on
a
worn
stone
bench
at
the
end
of
the
sunny
is
that
it
has
come
nearer
to
solving
the
problem
of
men
relations
to
each
other
than
any
system
invented
by
themselves
this
after
all
is
the
secret
principle
of
the
church
vitality
she
gave
a
spiritual
charter
of
equality
to
mankind
long
before
the
philosophers
thought
of
giving
them
a
material
one
if
all
the
while
she
has
been
fighting
for
dominion
arrogating
to
herself
special
privileges
struggling
to
preserve
the
old
lines
of
social
and
legal
demarcation
it
has
been
because
for
nigh
two
thousand
years
she
has
cherished
in
her
breast
the
one
free
city
of
the
spirit
because
to
guard
its
liberties
she
has
had
to
defend
and
strengthen
her
own
position
i
do
not
ask
you
to
consider
whence
comes
this
insight
into
the
needs
of
man
this
mysterious
power
over
him
i
ask
you
simply
to
confess
them
in
their
results
i
am
not
of
those
who
believe
that
god
permits
good
to
come
to
mankind
through
one
channel
only
and
i
doubt
not
that
now
and
in
times
past
the
thinkers
whom
your
highness
follows
have
done
much
to
raise
the
condition
of
their
fellows
but
i
would
have
you
observe
that
where
they
have
done
so
it
has
been
because
at
bottom
their
aims
coincided
with
the
church
the
deeper
you
probe
into
her
secret
sources
of
power
the
more
you
find
there
in
the
germ
if
you
will
but
still
potentially
active
all
those
humanising
energies
which
work
together
for
the
lifting
of
the
race
in
her
wisdom
and
her
patience
she
may
have
seen
fit
to
withhold
their
expression
to
let
them
seek
another
outlet
but
they
are
there
stored
in
her
consciousness
like
the
archetypes
of
the
platonists
in
the
universal
mind
it
is
the
knowledge
of
this
the
sure
knowledge
of
it
which
creates
the
atmosphere
of
serenity
that
you
feel
about
you
from
the
tilling
of
the
vineyards
or
the
dressing
of
a
beggar
sores
to
the
loftiest
and
most
complicated
intellectual
labour
imposed
on
him
each
brother
knows
that
his
daily
task
is
part
of
a
great
scheme
of
action
working
ever
from
imperfection
to
perfection
from
human
incompleteness
to
the
divine
completion
this
sense
of
being
not
straws
on
a
blind
wind
of
chance
but
units
in
an
ordered
force
gives
to
the
humblest
christian
an
individual
security
and
dignity
which
kings
on
their
thrones
might
envy
but
not
only
does
the
church
anticipate
every
tendency
of
mankind
alone
of
all
powers
she
knows
how
to
control
and
direct
the
passions
she
excites
this
it
is
which
makes
her
an
auxiliary
that
no
temporal
prince
can
well
despise
it
is
in
this
aspect
that
i
would
have
your
highness
consider
her
do
not
underrate
her
power
because
it
seems
based
on
the
commoner
instincts
rather
than
on
the
higher
faculties
of
man
that
is
one
of
the
sources
of
her
strength
she
can
support
her
claims
by
reason
and
argument
but
it
is
because
her
work
like
that
of
her
divine
founder
lies
chiefly
among
those
who
can
neither
reason
nor
argue
that
she
chooses
to
rest
her
appeal
on
the
simplest
and
most
universal
emotions
as
in
our
towns
the
streets
are
lit
mainly
by
the
tapers
before
the
shrines
of
the
saints
so
the
way
of
life
would
be
dark
to
the
great
multitude
of
men
but
for
the
light
of
faith
burning
within
them
meanwhile
the
shufflings
of
destiny
had
brought
to
trescorre
the
prize
for
which
he
waited
during
the
duke
illness
he
had
been
appointed
regent
of
pianura
and
his
sovereign
reluctance
to
take
up
the
cares
of
government
had
now
left
him
for
six
months
in
authority
the
day
after
the
proclaiming
of
the
constitution
odo
had
withdrawn
his
signature
from
it
on
the
ground
that
the
concessions
it
contained
were
inopportune
the
functions
of
government
went
on
again
in
the
old
way
the
old
abuses
persisted
the
old
offences
were
condoned
it
was
as
though
the
apathy
of
the
sovereign
had
been
communicated
to
his
people
centuries
of
submission
were
in
their
blood
and
for
two
generations
there
had
been
no
warfare
south
of
the
alps
for
the
moment
men
minds
were
turned
to
the
great
events
going
forward
in
france
it
had
not
yet
occurred
to
the
italians
that
the
recoil
of
these
events
might
be
felt
among
themselves
they
were
simply
amused
spectators
roused
at
last
to
the
significance
of
the
show
but
never
dreaming
that
they
might
soon
be
called
from
the
wings
to
the
footlights
to
de
crucis
however
the
possibility
of
such
a
call
was
already
present
and
it
was
he
who
pressed
the
duke
to
return
to
his
post
a
deep
reluctance
held
odo
back
he
would
have
liked
to
linger
on
in
the
monastery
leading
the
tranquil
yet
busy
life
of
the
monks
and
trying
to
read
the
baffling
riddle
of
its
completeness
at
that
moment
it
seemed
to
him
of
vastly
more
importance
to
discover
the
exact
nature
of
the
soul
whether
it
was
in
fact
a
metaphysical
entity
as
these
men
believed
or
a
mere
secretion
of
the
brain
as
he
had
been
taught
to
think
than
to
go
back
and
govern
his
people
for
what
mattered
the
rest
if
he
had
been
mistaken
about
the
soul
with
a
start
he
realised
that
he
was
going
as
his
cousin
had
gone
that
this
was
but
another
form
of
the
fatal
lethargy
that
hung
upon
his
race
an
effort
of
the
will
drew
him
back
to
pianura
and
made
him
resume
the
semblance
of
authority
but
it
carried
him
no
farther
trescorre
ostensibly
became
prime
minister
and
in
reality
remained
the
head
of
the
state
the
duke
was
present
at
the
cabinet
meetings
but
took
no
part
in
the
direction
of
affairs
his
mind
was
lost
in
a
maze
of
metaphysical
speculations
and
even
these
served
him
merely
as
some
toy
with
which
to
trick
his
leisure
his
revocation
of
the
charter
had
necessarily
separated
him
from
gamba
and
the
advanced
liberals
he
knew
that
the
hunchback
ever
scornful
of
expediency
charged
him
with
disloyalty
to
the
people
but
such
charges
could
no
longer
wound
the
events
following
the
duke
birthday
had
served
to
crystallise
the
schemes
of
the
little
liberal
group
and
they
now
formed
a
campaign
of
active
opposition
to
the
government
attacking
it
by
means
of
pamphlets
and
lampoons
and
by
such
public
speaking
as
the
police
allowed
the
new
professors
of
the
university
ardently
in
sympathy
with
the
constitutional
movement
used
their
lectures
as
means
of
political
teaching
and
the
old
stronghold
of
dogma
became
the
centre
of
destructive
criticism
but
as
yet
these
ideas
formed
but
a
single
live
point
in
the
general
numbness
two
years
passed
in
this
way
north
of
the
alps
all
europe
was
convulsed
while
italy
was
still
but
a
sleeper
who
tosses
in
his
sleep
in
the
two
sicilies
the
arrogance
and
perfidy
of
the
government
gave
a
few
martyrs
to
the
cause
and
in
bologna
there
was
a
brief
revolutionary
outbreak
but
for
the
most
part
the
italian
states
were
sinking
into
inanition
venice
by
recalling
her
fleet
from
greece
let
fall
the
dominion
of
the
sea
twenty
years
earlier
genoa
had
basely
yielded
corsica
to

the
pope
condemned
the
french
for
their
outrages
on
religion
and
his
subjects
murdered
basseville
the
agent
of
the
new
republic
the
sympathies
and
impulses
of
the
various
states
were
as
contradictory
as
they
were
ineffectual
meanwhile
in
france
europe
was
trying
to
solve
at
a
stroke
the
problems
of
a
thousand
years
all
the
repressed
passions
which
civilisation
had
sought
however
imperfectly
to
curb
stalked
abroad
destructive
as
flood
and
fire
the
great
generation
of
the
encyclopaedists
had
passed
away
and
the
teachings
of
rousseau
had
prevailed
over
those
of
montesquieu
and
voltaire
the
sober
sense
of
the
economists
was
swept
aside
by
the
sound
and
fury
of
the
demagogues
and
france
was
become
a
very
babel
of
tongues
the
old
malady
of
words
had
swept
over
the
world
like
a
pestilence
to
the
little
italian
courts
still
dozing
in
fancied
security
under
the
wing
of
bourbon
and
hapsburg
suzerains
these
rumours
were
borne
by
the
wild
flight
of
emigres
dead
leaves
loosened
by
the
first
blast
of
the
storm
month
by
month
they
poured
across
the
alps
in
numbers
bringing
confused
contradictory
tales
of
anarchy
and
outrage
among
those
whom
chance
thus
carried
to
pianura
were
certain
familiars
of
the
duke

the
count
alfieri
and
his
royal
mistress
flying
from
paris
and
arriving
breathless
with
the
tale
of
their
private
injuries
to
the
poet
of
revolt
this
sudden
realisation
of
his
doctrines
seemed
in
fact
a
purely
personal
outrage
it
was
as
though
a
man
writing
an
epic
poem
on
an
earthquake
should
suddenly
find
himself
engulphed
to
alfieri
the
downfall
of
the
french
monarchy
and
the
triumph
of
democratic
ideas
meant
simply
that
his
french
investments
had
shrunk
to
nothing
and
that

greatest

of
the
age
had
been
obliged
at
an
immense
sacrifice
of
personal
dignity
to
plead
with
a
drunken
mob
for
leave
to
escape
from
paris
to
the
wider
aspect
of
the
tragic
farce
as
he
called
it
his
eyes
remained
obstinately
closed
he
viewed
the
whole
revolutionary
movement
as
a
conspiracy
against
his
comfort
and
boasted
that
during
his
enforced
residence
in
france
he
had
not
so
much
as
exchanged
a
word
with
one
of
the
french
slaves
instigators
of
false
liberty
who
by
trying
to
put
into
action
the
principles
taught
in
his
previous
works
had
so
grievously
interfered
with
the
composition
of
fresh
masterpieces
the
royal
pretensions
of
the
countess
of
albany
pretentions
affirmed
rather
than
abated
as
the
tide
of
revolution
rose
made
it
impossible
that
she
should
be
received
at
the
court
of
pianura
but
the
duke
found
a
mild
entertainment
in
alfieri
company
the
poet
revulsion
of
feeling
seemed
to
odo
like
the
ironic
laughter
of
the
fates
his
thoughts
returned
to
the
midnight
meetings
of
the
honey
bees
and
to
the
first
vision
of
that
face
which
men
had
lain
down
their
lives
to
see
men
had
looked
on
that
face
since
then
and
its
horror
was
reflected
in
their
own
other
fugitives
to
pianura
brought
another
impression
of
events
that
comic
note
which
life
the
supreme
dramatic
artist
never
omits
from
her
tragedies
these
were
the
duke
old
friend
the
marquis
de
fleeing
from
his
chateau
as
the
peasants
put
the
torch
to
it
and
arriving
in
pianura
destitute
gouty
and
but
imperturbable
and
epigrammatic
as
ever
with
him
came
his
marquise
a
lady
stout
to
unwieldiness
and
much
given
to
devotion
in
whom
it
was
whispered
though
he
introduced
her
as
the
daughter
of
a
venetian
senator
that
a
reminiscent
eye
might
still
detect
the
outline
of
the
gracefullest
columbine
who
had
ever
flitted
across
the
italian
stage
these
visitors
were
lodged
by
the
duke
kindness
in
the
palazzo
cerveno
near
the
ducal
residence
and
though
the
ladies
of
pianura
were
inclined
to
look
askance
on
the
marquise
genealogy
yet
his
condescension
and
her
own
edifying
piety
had
soon
allayed
these
scruples
and
the
salon
of
madame
de
became
the
rival
of
madame
it
was
in
fact
the
more
entertaining
of
the
two
for
in
spite
of
his
lady
austere
views
the
marquis
retained
that
gift
of
social
flexibility
that
was
already
becoming
the
tradition
of
a
happier
day
to
the
marquis
indeed
the
revolution
was
execrable
not
so
much
because
of
the
hardships
it
inflicted
as
because
it
was
the
forerunner
of
social
dissolution
the
of
the
regime
which
had
made
manners
the
highest
morality
and
conversation
the
chief
end
of
man
he
could
have
lived
gaily
on
a
crust
in
good
company
and
amid
smiling
faces
but
the
social
deficiencies
of
pianura
were
more
difficult
to
endure
than
any
material
privation
in
italy
as
the
marquis
had
more
than
once
remarked
people
loved
gambled
wrote
poetry
and
patronised
the
arts
but
alas
they
did
not
converse
could
not
conceal
from
his
highness
that
there
was
no
conversation
in
pianura
but
he
did
his
best
to
fill
the
void
by
the
constant
exercise
of
his
own
gift
in
that
direction
and
to
odo
at
least
his
talk
seemed
as
good
as
it
was
copious
misfortune
had
given
a
finer
savour
to
the
philosophy
and
there
was
a
kind
of
heroic
grace
in
his
undisturbed
cultivation
of
the
amenities
while
the
marquis
was
struggling
to
preserve
the
conversational
art
and
alfieri
planning
the
savage
revenge
of
the
misogallo
the
course
of
affairs
in
france
had
gained
a
wilder
impetus
the
abolition
of
the
nobility
the
flight
and
capture
of
the
king
his
enforced
declaration
of
war
against
austria
the
massacres
of
avignon
the
sack
of
the
tuileries
such
events
seemed
incredible
enough
till
the
next
had
crowded
them
out
of
mind
the
new
year
rose
in
blood
and
mounted
to
a
bloodier
noon
all
the
old
defences
were
falling
religion
monarchy
law
were
sucked
down
into
the
whirlpool
of
liberated
passions
across
that
sanguinary
scene
passed
like
a
mocking
ghost
the
vision
of
the
perfectibility
of
man
man
was
free
at
last
freer
than
his
liberators
had
ever
dreamed
of
making
him
and
he
used
his
freedom
like
a
beast
for
the
multitude
had
risen
that
multitude
which
no
man
could
number
which
even
the
demagogues
who
ranted
in
its
name
had
never
seriously
reckoned
with
that
dim
grovelling
indistinguishable
mass
on
which
the
whole
social
structure
rested
it
was
as
though
the
very
soil
moved
rising
in
mountains
or
yawning
in
chasms
about
the
feet
of
those
who
had
so
long
securely
battened
on
it
the
earth
shook
the
sun
and
moon
were
darkened
and
the
people
the
terrible
unknown
people
had
put
in
the
sickle
to
the
harvest
italy
roused
herself
at
last
the
emissaries
of
the
new
france
were
swarming
across
the
alps
pervading
the
peninsula
as
the
jesuits
had
once
pervaded
europe
and
in
the
mind
of
a
young
general
of
the
republican
army
visions
of
italian
conquest
were
already
forming
in
pianura
the
revolutionary
agents
found
a
strong
republican
party
headed
by
gamba
and
his
friends
and
a
government
weakened
by
debt
and
dissensions
the
air
was
thick
with
intrigue
the
little
army
could
no
longer
be
counted
on
and
a
prolonged
had
driven
trescorre
out
of
the
ministry
and
compelled
the
duke
to
appoint
andreoni
in
his
place
behind
andreoni
stood
gamba
and
the
radicals
there
could
be
no
doubt
which
way
the
fortunes
of
the
duchy
tended
the
duke
protectors
austria
and
the
holy
see
were
too
busy
organising
the
hasty
coalition
of
the
powers
to
come
to
his
aid
had
he
cared
to
call
on
them
but
to
do
so
would
have
been
but
another
way
of
annihilation
to
preserve
the
individuality
of
his
state
or
to
merge
it
in
the
vision
of
a
united
italy
seemed
to
him
the
only
alternatives
worth
fighting
for
the
former
was
a
futile
dream
the
latter
seemed
for
a
brief
moment
possible
piedmont
ever
loyal
to
the
monarchical
principle
was
calling
on
her
sister
states
to
arm
themselves
against
the
french
invasion
but
the
response
was
reluctant
and
uncertain
private
ambitions
and
petty
jealousies
hampered
every
attempt
at
union
austria
the
bourbons
and
the
holy
see
held
the
italian
principalities
in
a
network
of
conflicting
interests
and
obligations
that
rendered
free
action
impossible
sadly
victor
amadeus
armed
himself
alone
against
the
enemy
under
such
conditions
odo
could
do
little
to
direct
the
course
of
events
they
had
passed
into
more
powerful
hands
than
his
but
he
could
at
least
declare
himself
for
or
against
the
mighty
impulse
which
was
behind
them
the
ideas
he
had
striven
for
had
triumphed
at
last
and
his
surest
hold
on
authority
was
to
share
openly
in
their
triumph
a
profound
horror
dragged
him
back
the
new
principles
were
not
those
for
which
he
had
striven
the
goddess
of
the
new
worship
was
but
a
bloody
maenad
who
had
borrowed
the
attributes
of
freedom
he
could
not
bow
the
knee
in
such
a
tranquilly
resolutely
he
took
up
the
policy
of
repression
he
knew
the
attempt
was
foredoomed
to
failure
but
that
made
no
difference
now
he
was
simply
acting
out
the
inevitable
the
last
act
came
with
unexpected
suddenness
the
duke
woke
one
morning
to
find
the
citadel
in
the
possession
of
the
people
the
impregnable
stronghold
of
bracciaforte
was
in
the
hands
of
the
serfs
whose
fathers
had
toiled
to
build
it
and
the
last
descendant
of
bracciaforte
was
virtually
a
prisoner
in
his
palace
the
revolution
took
place
quietly
without
violence
or
bloodshed
andreoni
waited
on
the
duke
and
a
was
summoned
the
ministers
affected
to
have
yielded
reluctantly
to
popular
pressure
all
they
asked
was
a
constitution
and
the
assurance
that
no
resistance
would
be
offered
to
the
french
the
duke
requested
a
few
hours
for
deliberation
left
alone
he
summoned
the
duchess
chamberlain
the
ducal
pair
no
longer
met
save
on
occasions
of
state
they
had
not
exchanged
a
word
since
the
death
of
fulvia
vivaldi
odo
sent
word
to
her
highness
that
he
could
no
longer
answer
for
her
security
while
she
remained
in
the
duchy
and
that
he
begged
her
to
leave
immediately
for
vienna
she
replied
that
she
was
obliged
for
his
warning
but
that
while
he
remained
in
pianura
her
place
was
at
his
side
it
was
the
answer
he
had
expected
he
had
never
doubted
her
courage
but
it
was
essential
to
his
course
that
she
should
leave
the
duchy
without
delay
and
after
a
moment
reflection
he
wrote
a
letter
in
which
he
informed
her
that
he
must
insist
on
her
obedience
no
answer
was
returned
but
he
learned
that
she
had
turned
white
and
tearing
the
letter
in
shreds
had
called
for
her
within
the
hour
he
sent
to
enquire
when
he
might
take
leave
of
her
but
she
excused
herself
on
the
plea
of
indisposition
and
before
nightfall
he
heard
the
departing
rattle
of
her
wheels
he
immediately
summoned
andreoni
and
announced
his
unconditional
refusal
of
the
terms
proposed
to
him
he
would
not
give
a
constitution
or
promise
allegiance
to
the
french
the
minister
withdrew
and
odo
was
left
alone
he
had
dismissed
his
gentlemen
and
as
he
sat
in
his
closet
a
sense
of
deathlike
isolation
came
over
him
never
had
the
palace
seemed
so
silent
or
so
vast
he
had
not
a
friend
to
turn
to
de
crucis
was
in
germany
and
trescorre
it
was
reported
had
privately
attended
the
duchess
in
her
flight
the
waves
of
destiny
seemed
closing
over
odo
and
the
circumstances
of
his
past
rose
poignant
and
vivid
before
his
drowning
sight
and
suddenly
in
that
moment
of
failure
and
abandonment
it
seemed
to
him
again
that
life
was
worth
the
living
his
indifference
fell
from
him
like
a
garment
the
old
passion
of
action
awoke
and
he
felt
a
new
warmth
in
his
breast
after
all
the
struggle
was
not
yet
over
though
piedmont
had
called
in
vain
on
the
italian
states
an
italian
sword
might
still
be
drawn
in
her
service
if
his
people
would
not
follow
him
against
france
he
could
still
march
against
her
alone
old
memories
hummed
in
him
at
the
thought
he
recalled
how
his
piedmontese
ancestors
had
gone
forth
against
the
same
foe
and
the
stout
donnaz
blood
began
to
bubble
in
his
veins
a
knock
roused
him
and
gamba
entered
by
the
private
way
his
appearance
was
not
unexpected
to
odo
and
served
only
to
reinforce
his
energy
he
felt
that
the
issue
was
at
hand
as
he
expected
gamba
had
been
sent
to
put
before
him
more
forcibly
and
unceremoniously
the
veiled
threat
of
the
ministers
but
the
hunchback
had
come
also
to
plead
with
his
master
in
his
own
name
and
in
the
name
of
the
ideas
for
which
they
had
once
laboured
together
he
could
not
believe
that
the
reaction
was
more
than
momentary
he
could
not
calculate
the
strength
of
the
old
associations
which
now
that
the
tide
had
set
the
other
way
were
dragging
odo
back
to
the
beliefs
and
traditions
of
his
caste
the
duke
listened
in
silence
then
he
said
discussion
is
idle
i
have
no
answer
to
give
but
that
which
i
have
already
given
he
rose
from
his
seat
in
token
of
dismissal
the
moment
was
painful
to
both
men
gamba
drew
nearer
and
fell
at
the
duke
feet
your
highness
he
said
consider
what
this
means
we
hold
the
state
in
our
hands
if
you
are
against
us
you
are
powerless
if
you
are
with
us
we
can
promise
you
more
power
than
you
ever
dreamed
of
possessing
the
duke
looked
at
him
with
a
musing
smile
it
is
as
though
you
offered
me
gold
in
a
desert
island
he
said
do
not
waste
such
poor
bribes
on
me
i
care
for
no
power
but
the
power
to
wipe
out
the
work
of
these
last
years
failing
that
i
want
nothing
that
you
or
any
other
man
can
give
gamba
was
silent
a
moment
he
turned
aside
into
the
embrasure
of
the
window
and
when
he
spoke
again
it
was
in
a
voice
broken
with
grief
your
highness
he
said
if
your
choice
is
made
ours
is
made
also
it
is
a
hard
choice
but
these
are
fratricidal
hours
we
have
come
to
the
parting
of
the
ways
the
duke
made
no
sign
and
gamba
went
on
with
gathering
anguish
we
would
have
gone
to
the
world
end
with
your
highness
for
our
leader
with
a
leader
whom
you
could
lead
odo
interposed
he
went
up
to
gamba
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
speak
out
man
he
said
say
what
you
were
sent
to
say
am
i
a
prisoner
the
hunchback
burst
into
tears
odo
with
his
arms
crossed
stood
leaning
against
the
window
the
other
anguish
seemed
to
deepen
his
detachment
your
highness
your
highness
gamba
stammered
the
duke
made
an
impatient
gesture
come
make
an
end
he
said
gamba
fell
back
with
a
profound
bow
we
do
not
ask
the
surrender
of
your
highness
person
he
said
not
even
that
odo
returned
with
a
faint
sneer
gamba
flushed
to
the
temples
but
the
retort
died
on
his
lips
your
highness
he
said
scarce
above
a
whisper
the
gates
are
guarded
but
the
word
for
tonight
is
he
knelt
and
kissed
odo
hand
then
he
rose
and
passed
out
of
the
room
before
dawn
the
duke
left
the
palace
the
high
emotions
of
the
night
had
ebbed
he
saw
himself
now
in
the
ironic
light
of
morning
as
a
fugitive
too
harmless
to
be
worth
pursuing
his
enemies
had
let
him
keep
his
sword
because
they
had
no
cause
to
fear
it
alone
he
passed
through
the
gardens
of
the
palace
and
out
into
the
desert
darkness
of
the
streets
skirting
the
wall
of
the
benedictine
convent
where
fulvia
had
lodged
he
gained
a
street
leading
to
the
marketplace
in
the
pallor
of
the
waning
night
the
ancient
monuments
of
his
race
stood
up
mournful
and
deserted
as
a
line
of
tombs
the
city
seemed
a
and
he
the
ineffectual
ghost
of
its
dead
past
he
reached
the
gates
and
gave
the
watchword
the
gates
were
guarded
as
he
had
been
advised
but
the
captain
of
the
watch
let
him
pass
without
show
of
hesitation
or
curiosity
though
he
made
no
effort
at
disguise
he
went
forth
unrecognised
and
the
city
closed
her
doors
on
him
as
carelessly
as
on
any
passing
wanderer
beyond
the
gates
a
lad
from
the
ducal
stables
waited
with
a
horse
odo
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
rode
on
toward
pontesordo
the
darkness
was
growing
thinner
and
the
meagre
details
of
the
landscape
with
its
huddled
and
began
to
define
themselves
as
he
advanced
to
his
left
the
field
stretched
grey
and
sodden
ahead
on
his
right
hung
the
dark
woods
of
the
ducal
chase
presently
a
bend
of
the
road
brought
him
within
sight
of
the
keep
of
pontesordo
his
way
led
past
it
toward
valsecca
but
some
obscure
instinct
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
him
and
at
the
he
bent
to
the
right
and
rode
across
the
marshland
to
the
old
the
farmyard
lay
hushed
and
deserted
the
peasants
who
lived
there
would
soon
be
afoot
but
for
the
moment
odo
had
the
place
to
himself
he
tethered
his
horse
to
a
and
walked
across
the
rough
to
the
chapel
its
floor
was
still
heaped
with
and
dried
vegetables
and
in
the
dimness
a
heavier
veil
of
dust
seemed
to
obscure
the
painted
walls
odo
advanced
picking
his
way
among
broken
ploughshares
and
stacks
of
maize
till
he
stood
near
the
old
marble
altar
with
its
and
acanthus
volutes
the
place
laid
its
tranquillising
hush
on
him
and
he
knelt
on
the
step
beneath
the
altar
something
stirred
in
him
as
he
knelt
there
a
prayer
yet
not
a
prayer
a
reaching
out
obscure
and
inarticulate
toward
all
that
had
survived
of
his
early
hopes
and
faiths
a
loosening
of
old
founts
of
pity
a
longing
to
be
somehow
somewhere
reunited
to
his
old
belief
in
life
how
long
he
knelt
he
knew
not
but
when
he
looked
up
the
chapel
was
full
of
a
pale
light
and
in
the
first
shaft
of
the
sunrise
the
face
of
saint
francis
shone
out
on
him
he
went
forth
into
the
daybreak
and
rode
away
toward
piedmont
