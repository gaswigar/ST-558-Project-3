printed

advertisement
the
publishers
of
the
collection
of
standard
novels
are
extremely
desirous
that
i
should
furnish
them
with
a
few
lines
by
way
of
introduction
to
the
appearance
of
leon
in
its
present
form
i
am
however
at
a
loss
how
to
oblige
them
in
the
original
preface
i
frankly
stated
the
sources
upon
which
i
had
drawn
for
the
idea
and
conduct
of
the
work
i
have
therefore
no
remarks
to
offer
but
these
which
follow
in
i
produced
the
novel
of
caleb
williams
i
believed
myself
fortunate
in
the
selection
i
had
made
of
the
of
that
work
an
atrocious
crime
committed
by
a
man
previously
of
the
most
exemplary
habits
the
annoyance
he
suffers
from
the
immeasurable
and
curiosity
of
a
raw
youth
who
is
placed
about
his
person
the
state
of
doubt
in
which
the
reader
might
for
a
time
be
as
to
the
truth
of
the
charges
and
the
consequences
growing
out
of
these
causes
seemed
to
me
to
afford
scope
for
a
narrative
of
no
common
interest
i
was
not
disappointed
caleb
williams
was
honoured
with
the
public
favour
the
consequence
was
that
i
was
solicited
to
try
my
hand
again
in
a
work
of
fiction
i
hesitated
long
i
despaired
of
finding
again
a
topic
so
rich
of
interest
and
passion
in
those
days
it
was
deemed
a
most
daring
thought
to
attempt
to
write
a
novel
with
the
hope
that
it
might
hereafter
rank
among
the
classics
of
a
language
the
most
successful
english
writers
in
that
province
of
literature
had
scarcely
gone
beyond
three
it
had
not
then
been
conceived
that
the
same
author
might
produce
twenty
or
thirty
at
the
rate
of
two
or
three
and
might
still
at
least
retain
his
hold
upon
the
partiality
of
his
contemporaries
to
sir
walter
scott
we
are
indebted
for
this
discovery
at
length
after
having
passed
some
years
in
a
state
of
diffidence
and
irresolution
i
ventured
on
the
task
it
struck
me
that
if
i
could
mix
human
feelings
and
passions
with
incredible
situations
i
might
thus
attain
a
sort
of
novelty
that
would
conciliate
the
patience
at
least
even
of
some
of
the
severest
judges
to
this
way
of
thinking
leon
was
indebted
for
a
local
habitation
and
a
one
of
my
most
valued
friends
northcote
has
often
told
me
that
the
public
may
sometimes
be
interested
in
the
perusal
of
a
book
but
that
they
never
give
themselves
any
trouble
about
the
author
he
therefore
kindly
advised
me
on
no
occasion
to
say
any
thing
in
print
about
myself
the
present
race
of
readers
seem
scarcely
disposed
to
verify
this
maxim
they
are
understood
to
be
desirous
to
learn
something
of
the
peculiarities
the
life
character
and
behaviour
of
an
author
before
they
consign
him
to
the
gulph
of
oblivion
and
are
willing
to
learn
from
his
own
testimony
what
train
of
thoughts
induced
him
to
adopt
the
particular
subject
and
plan
of
the
work
upon
the
perusal
of
which
they
are
engaged
preface
the
following
passage
from
a
work
said
to
be
written
by
the
late
john
campbel
and
entitled
suggested
the
first
hint
of
the
present
performance
there
happened
in
the
year
an
odd
accident
at
venice
that
made
a
very
great
stir
then
and
which
i
think
deserves
to
be
rescued
from
oblivion
the
great
freedom
and
ease
with
which
all
persons
who
make
a
good
appearance
live
in
that
city
is
known
sufficiently
to
all
who
are
acquainted
with
it
such
will
not
therefore
be
surprised
that
a
stranger
who
went
by
the
name
of
signor
gualdi
and
who
made
a
considerable
figure
there
was
admitted
into
the
best
company
though
nobody
knew
who
or
what
he
was
he
remained
at
venice
for
some
months
and
three
things
were
remarked
in
his
conduct
the
first
was
that
he
had
a
small
collection
of
fine
pictures
which
he
readily
showed
to
any
body
that
desired
it
the
next
that
he
was
perfectly
versed
in
all
arts
and
sciences
and
spoke
on
every
subject
with
such
readiness
and
sagacity
as
astonished
all
who
heard
him
and
it
was
in
the
third
place
observed
that
he
never
wrote
or
received
any
letter
never
desired
any
credit
or
made
use
of
bills
of
exchange
but
paid
for
every
thing
in
ready
money
and
lived
decently
though
not
in
splendour
this
gentleman
met
one
day
at
the
with
a
venetian
nobleman
who
was
an
extraordinary
good
judge
of
pictures
he
had
heard
of
signor
gualdi
s
collection
and
in
a
very
polite
manner
desired
to
see
them
to
which
the
other
very
readily
consented
after
the
venetian
had
viewed
signor
gualdi
s
collection
and
expressed
his
satisfaction
by
telling
him
that
he
had
never
seen
a
finer
considering
the
number
of
pieces
of
which
it
consisted
he
cast
his
eye
by
chance
over
the
where
hung
a
picture
of
this
stranger
the
venetian
looked
upon
it
and
then
upon
him
this
picture
was
drawn
for
you
sir
says
he
to
signor
gualdi
to
which
the
other
made
no
answer
but
by
a
low
bow
you
look
continued
the
venetian
like
a
man
of
fifty
and
yet
i
know
this
picture
to
be
of
the
hand
of
titian
who
has
been
dead
one
hundred
and
thirty
years
how
is
this
possible
it
is
not
easy
said
signor
gualdi
gravely
to
know
all
things
that
are
possible
but
there
is
certainly
no
crime
in
my
being
like
a
picture
drawn
by
the
venetian
easily
perceived
by
his
manner
of
speaking
that
he
had
given
the
stranger
offence
and
therefore
took
his
leave
he
could
not
forbear
speaking
of
this
in
the
evening
to
some
of
his
friends
who
resolved
to
satisfy
themselves
by
looking
upon
the
picture
the
next
day
in
order
to
have
an
opportunity
of
doing
so
they
went
to
the
about
the
time
that
signor
gualdi
was
wont
to
come
thither
and
not
meeting
with
him
one
of
them
who
had
often
conversed
with
him
went
to
his
lodgings
to
enquire
after
him
where
he
heard
that
he
had
set
out
an
hour
before
for
vienna
this
affair
made
a
great
noise
and
found
a
place
in
all
the
newspapers
of
that
it
is
well
known
that
the
philosopher
s
stone
the
art
of
transmuting
metals
into
gold
and
the
which
was
to
restore
youth
and
make
him
that
possessed
it
immortal
formed
a
principal
object
of
the
studies
of
the
curious
for
centuries
many
stories
beside
this
of
signor
gualdi
have
been
told
of
persons
who
were
supposed
to
be
in
possession
of
those
wonderful
secrets
in
search
of
which
hundreds
of
unfortunate
adventurers
wasted
their
fortunes
and
their
lives
it
has
been
said
of
shakespear
that
he
exhausted
worlds
and
then
imagined
new
but
the
burthen
sustained
by
shakespear
was
too
heavy
for
the
shoulders
of
any
other
individual
i
leave
the
first
part
of
the
task
above
mentioned
to
be
divided
among
those
celebrated
novelists
living
and
dead
who
have
attempted
to
delineate
the
scenes
of
real
life
in
this
little
work
i
have
endeavoured
to
gain
footing
in
one
neglected
track
of
the
latter
province
the
hearts
and
the
curiosity
of
readers
have
been
assailed
in
so
many
ways
that
we
writers
who
bring
up
the
rear
of
our
illustrious
predecessors
must
be
contented
to
arrive
at
novelty
in
whatever
mode
we
are
able
the
foundation
of
the
following
tale
is
such
as
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
ever
existed
but
if
i
have
mixed
human
feelings
and
passions
with
incredible
situations
and
thus
rendered
them
impressive
and
interesting
i
shall
entertain
some
hope
to
be
pardoned
the
boldness
and
irregularity
of
my
design
some
readers
of
my
graver
productions
will
perhaps
in
perusing
these
little
volumes
accuse
me
of
inconsistency
the
affections
and
charities
of
private
life
being
every
where
in
this
publication
a
topic
of
the
warmest
eulogium
while
in
the
enquiry
concerning
political
justice
they
seemed
to
be
treated
with
no
great
degree
of
indulgence
and
favour
in
answer
to
this
objection
all
i
think
it
necessary
to
say
on
the
present
occasion
is
that
for
more
than
four
years
i
have
been
anxious
for
opportunity
and
leisure
to
modify
some
of
the
earlier
chapters
of
that
work
in
conformity
to
the
sentiments
inculcated
in
this
not
that
i
see
cause
to
make
any
change
respecting
the
principle
of
justice
or
any
thing
else
fundamental
to
the
system
there
delivered
but
that
i
apprehend
domestic
and
private
affections
inseparable
from
the
nature
of
man
and
from
what
may
be
styled
the
culture
of
the
heart
and
am
fully
persuaded
that
they
are
not
incompatible
with
a
profound
and
active
sense
of
justice
in
the
mind
of
him
that
cherishes
them
true
wisdom
will
recommend
to
us
individual
attachments
for
with
them
our
minds
are
more
thoroughly
maintained
in
activity
and
life
than
they
can
be
under
the
privation
of
them
and
it
is
better
that
man
should
be
a
living
being
than
a
stock
or
a
stone
true
virtue
will
sanction
this
recommendation
since
it
is
the
object
of
virtue
to
produce
happiness
and
since
the
man
who
lives
in
the
midst
of
domestic
relations
will
have
many
opportunities
of
conferring
pleasure
minute
in
the
detail
yet
not
trivial
in
the
amount
without
interfering
with
the
purposes
of
general
benevolence
nay
by
kindling
his
sensibility
and
harmonising
his
soul
they
may
be
expected
if
he
is
endowed
with
a
liberal
and
manly
spirit
to
render
him
more
prompt
in
the
service
of
strangers
and
the
public
travels
of
leon
chapter
i
there
is
nothing
that
human
imagination
can
figure
brilliant
and
enviable
that
human
genius
and
skill
do
not
aspire
to
realize
in
the
early
ages
of
antiquity
one
of
the
favourite
topics
of
speculation
was
a
perfect
system
of
civil
policy
and
no
sooner
had
plato
delineated
his
imaginary
republic
than
he
sought
for
a
spot
of
earth
upon
which
to
execute
his
plan
in
my
own
times
and
for
upwards
of
a
century
before
them
the
subject
which
has
chiefly
occupied
men
of
intrepid
and
persevering
study
has
been
the
great
secret
of
nature
the
in
its
two
grand
and
inseparable
branches
the
art
of
multiplying
gold
and
of
defying
the
inroads
of
infirmity
and
death
it
is
notorious
that
uncommon
talents
and
unparalleled
industry
have
been
engaged
in
this
mighty
task
it
has
i
know
been
disputed
by
the
audacious
adversaries
of
all
sober
and
reasonable
evidence
whether
these
talents
and
industry
have
in
any
case
attained
the
object
they
sought
it
is
not
to
my
purpose
to
ascertain
the
number
of
those
whose
victory
over
the
powers
and
inertness
of
matter
has
been
complete
it
is
enough
that
i
am
a
living
instance
of
the
existence
of
such
men
to
these
two
secrets
if
they
are
to
be
considered
as
two
i
have
been
for
years
in
the
habit
of
resorting
for
my
gratification
i
have
in
my
possession
the
choice
of
being
as
wealthy
as
i
please
and
the
gift
of
immortal
life
every
thing
that
i
see
almost
i
can
without
difficulty
make
my
own
for
what
palaces
pictures
parks
or
gardens
rarities
of
art
or
nature
have
not
a
price
at
which
their
owner
will
consent
to
yield
them
the
luxuries
of
every
quarter
of
the
world
are
emptied
at
my
feet
i
can
command
to
an
extent
almost
inconceivable
the
passions
of
men
what
heart
can
withstand
the
assault
of
princely
magnificence
what
man
is
inaccessible
to
a
bribe
add
to
these
advantages
that
i
am
invulnerable
to
disease
every
sun
that
rises
finds
the
circulations
of
my
frame
in
the
most
perfect
order
decrepitude
can
never
approach
me
a
thousand
winters
want
the
power
to
furrow
my
countenance
with
wrinkles
or
turn
my
hairs
to
silver
exhaustless
wealth
and
eternal
youth
are
the
attributes
by
which
i
am
distinguished
from
the
rest
of
mankind
i
do
not
sit
down
now
to
write
a
treatise
of
natural
philosophy
the
condition
by
which
i
hold
my
privileges
is
that
they
must
never
be
imparted
i
sit
down
purely
to
relate
a
few
of
those
extraordinary
events
that
have
been
produced
in
the
period
of
my
life
which
is
already
elapsed
by
the
circumstances
and
the
peculiarity
to
which
i
have
just
alluded
it
is
so
obvious
as
to
make
it
almost
improper
to
specify
it
that
the
pursuit
in
which
so
many
of
my
contemporaries
are
engaged
and
the
end
of
which
i
have
so
singularly
achieved
is
in
its
appearance
infinitely
more
grand
and
interesting
than
that
which
occupied
the
thoughts
of
plato
and
the
most
eminent
writers
of
antiquity
what
is
political
liberty
compared
with
unbounded
riches
and
immortal
vigour
the
immediate
application
of
political
liberty
is
to
render
a
man
s
patrimony
or
the
fruits
of
his
industry
completely
his
own
and
to
preserve
them
from
the
invasion
of
others
but
the
petty
detail
of
preservation
or
gradual
acquisition
can
never
enter
into
competition
with
the
which
endows
a
man
in
a
moment
with
every
thing
that
the
human
heart
can
wish
considered
in
this
light
how
mean
and
contemptible
does
the
ambition
of
the
boasted
ancients
appear
compared
with
ours
what
adept
or
probationer
of
the
present
day
would
be
content
to
resign
the
study
of
god
and
the
profounder
secrets
of
nature
and
to
bound
his
ardour
to
the
investigation
of
his
own
miserable
existence
it
may
seem
perhaps
to
many
that
the
history
of
a
person
possessed
of
advantages
so
unparalleled
as
mine
must
be
like
the
history
of
paradise
or
of
the
future
happiness
of
the
blessed
too
calm
and
motionless
too
much
of
one
invariable
texture
and
exempt
from
vicissitude
to
excite
the
attention
or
interest
the
passions
of
the
reader
if
he
will
have
patience
and
apply
to
the
perusal
of
my
narrative
he
will
in
no
long
time
perceive
how
far
his
conjecture
is
founded
in
sagacity
and
reason
some
persons
may
be
curious
to
know
what
motives
can
have
induced
a
man
of
such
enormous
wealth
and
so
every
way
qualified
to
revel
in
delights
to
take
the
trouble
of
penning
his
memoirs
the
immortality
with
which
i
am
endowed
seems
to
put
out
of
the
question
the
common
motives
that
relate
to
posthumous
fame
the
curiosity
here
mentioned
if
it
really
exists
i
can
not
consent
to
gratify
i
will
anticipate
nothing
in
the
progress
of
my
story
my
motive
for
recording
it
will
probably
become
evident
i
am
descended
from
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
honourable
families
of
the
kingdom
of
france
i
was
the
only
child
of
my
father
who
died
while
i
was
an
infant
my
mother
was
a
woman
of
rather
a
masculine
understanding
and
full
of
the
prejudices
of
nobility
and
magnificence
her
whole
soul
was
in
a
manner
concentrated
in
the
ambition
to
render
me
the
worthy
successor
of
the
counts
de
leon
who
had
figured
with
distinguished
reputation
in
the
wars
of
the
holy
land
my
father
had
died
fighting
gallantly
in
the
plains
of
italy
under
the
standard
of
louis
the
twelfth
a
prince
whose
name
was
never
repeated
to
me
unaccompanied
with
the
praises
due
to
his
military
prowess
and
to
the
singular
humanity
of
disposition
by
which
he
acquired
the
title
of
father
of
his
my
mother
s
mind
was
inflamed
with
the
greatness
of
my
ancestors
and
she
indefatigably
sought
to
kindle
in
my
bosom
a
similar
flame
it
has
been
a
custom
for
the
barons
and
feudal
vassals
of
the
kings
of
france
to
enter
with
great
personal
expense
into
the
brilliant
and
dazzling
expeditions
of
their
sovereigns
and
my
father
greatly
impaired
his
fortune
in
preparations
for
that
very
campaign
in
which
he
terminated
his
life
my
mother
industriously
applied
herself
to
the
restoration
of
my
patrimony
and
the
long
period
of
my
minority
afforded
her
scope
for
that
purpose
it
was
impossible
for
any
boy
to
be
treated
with
more
kindness
and
considerate
indulgence
than
i
was
during
the
period
of
my
adolescence
my
mother
loved
me
to
the
very
utmost
limits
perhaps
of
human
affection
i
was
her
darling
and
her
pride
her
waking
study
and
her
nightly
dream
yet
i
was
not
pampered
into
corporeal
imbecility
or
suffered
to
rust
in
inactivity
of
mind
i
was
provided
with
the
best
masters
i
was
excited
and
successfully
excited
zealously
to
apply
myself
to
the
lessons
they
taught
i
became
intimately
acquainted
with
the
italian
writers
of
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
i
was
initiated
in
the
study
of
the
classics
to
the
cultivation
of
which
the
revival
of
letters
at
this
time
gave
particular
ardour
i
was
instructed
in
the
principles
of
the
fine
arts
there
was
no
species
of
accomplishment
at
that
time
in
vogue
that
my
mother
was
not
anxious
i
should
make
my
own
the
only
science
i
neglected
was
the
very
science
which
has
since
given
rise
to
the
most
extraordinary
events
of
my
life
but
the
object
to
which
my
attention
was
principally
called
was
the
pursuit
of
military
exercises
and
the
cultivation
of
every
thing
that
could
add
to
the
strength
agility
or
grace
of
my
body
and
to
the
adventurousness
and
enterprise
of
my
mind
my
mother
loved
my
honour
and
my
fame
more
than
she
loved
my
person
a
circumstance
that
tended
perhaps
more
than
any
other
to
fix
the
yet
fluctuating
character
of
my
youthful
mind
was
my
being
present
as
a
spectator
at
the
celebrated
meeting
between
francis
the
first
and
henry
the
eighth
king
of
england
in
a
field
between
ardres
and
guines
my
mother
refused
to
accompany
me
being
already
arrived
at
an
age
in
which
curiosity
and
the
love
of
festive
scenes
are
usually
diminished
and
the
expenses
incurred
by
all
the
nobility
who
attended
upon
this
scene
being
incompatible
with
the
economy
to
which
she
rigidly
adhered
i
was
therefore
placed
under
the
protection
of
the
marquis
de
villeroy
her
brother
and
with
two
servants
who
attended
me
formed
a
part
of
his
suite
i
was
at
this
time
fifteen
years
of
age
my
contemplations
had
been
familiar
with
ideas
of
magnificence
and
grandeur
but
my
life
had
been
spent
in
the
most
sequestered
retirement
this
contrast
had
a
particular
effect
upon
my
disposition
it
irritated
to
a
very
high
degree
my
passion
for
splendour
and
distinction
i
lived
in
the
fairy
fields
of
visionary
greatness
and
was
more
than
indifferent
to
the
major
part
of
the
objects
around
me
i
pined
for
every
thing
the
reverse
of
my
present
condition
i
cultivated
the
exercises
in
which
i
was
engaged
only
as
they
were
calculated
to
prepare
me
for
future
achievements
by
the
incident
i
have
mentioned
i
was
transported
at
once
from
a
scene
of
modest
obscurity
to
a
scene
of
the
most
lavish
splendour
that
the
world
perhaps
ever
contemplated
i
never
remembered
to
have
seen
even
paris
itself
the
prevailing
taste
of
europe
has
for
some
time
led
very
much
to
costliness
in
dress
this
taste
in
its
present
profusion
i
believe
took
its
rise
in
the
field
of
the
vale
of
ardres
the
two
kings
were
both
in
the
vigour
of
their
youth
and
were
said
to
be
the
handsomest
men
of
the
age
in
which
they
lived
the
beauty
of
henry
was
sturdy
and
muscular
that
of
francis
more
refined
and
elegant
without
subtracting
in
any
considerable
degree
from
the
firmness
of
his
make
henry
was
four
years
older
than
his
brother
monarch
the
first
of
them
might
have
been
taken
as
a
model
to
represent
a
youthful
hercules
and
the
last
an
apollo
the
splendour
of
dress
that
was
worn
upon
this
occasion
exceeds
almost
all
credibility
every
person
of
distinction
might
be
said
in
a
manner
to
carry
an
estate
upon
his
shoulders
nor
was
the
variety
of
garments
inferior
to
the
richness
wolsey
a
man
whose
magnificence
of
disposition
was
only
surpassed
by
the
pride
of
his
soul
was
for
the
most
part
the
director
of
the
whole
he
possessed
the
most
absolute
ascendancy
over
the
mind
of
his
master
at
the
same
time
that
francis
artfully
indulged
his
caprice
that
he
might
claim
from
him
in
return
a
similar
indulgence
in
weightier
matters
the
pomp
of
processions
and
the
ceremony
of
opening
this
memorable
festival
went
first
a
sort
of
solemn
and
pageant
which
the
eye
took
in
at
leisure
and
took
in
till
it
was
filled
this
was
succeeded
by
every
thing
that
was
rapid
animated
and
interesting
masques
and
exhibitions
of
all
kinds
and
which
was
still
more
to
me
and
which
my
soul
devoured
with
indescribable
ardour
joustings
tilts
and
tournaments
without
end
the
beauty
of
the
armour
the
caparisons
of
the
steeds
the
mettle
of
the
animals
themselves
and
the
ardour
and
grace
of
the
combatants
surpassed
every
thing
that
my
fancy
had
ever
painted
these
scenes
were
acted
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
amphitheatre
of
spectators
where
all
that
was
noble
and
eminent
of
either
country
was
assembled
the
manliness
of
aspiring
youth
and
the
boundless
varieties
of
female
attraction
all
were
in
their
gayest
attire
every
eye
was
lighted
up
with
complacency
and
joy
if
heraclitus
or
any
other
morose
philosopher
who
has
expatiated
on
the
universal
misery
of
mankind
had
entered
the
field
of
ardres
he
must
have
retracted
his
assertions
or
fled
from
the
scene
with
confusion
the
kings
were
placed
at
either
end
of
the
lists
surrounded
with
their
courtiers
every
eye
through
this
vast
assembly
was
fixed
upon
the
combatants
the
body
of
every
one
present
was
inclined
this
way
or
that
in
unconscious
sympathy
with
the
redoubted
knights
from
time
to
time
as
the
favourites
of
either
party
prevailed
the
air
was
rent
with
shouts
and
acclamations
what
added
to
the
fascination
of
all
that
i
have
yet
mentioned
was
that
now
for
the
first
time
in
an
equal
degree
perhaps
for
centuries
the
stiffness
of
unwieldy
form
was
laid
aside
and
the
heart
of
man
expanded
itself
with
generosity
and
confidence
it
burst
the
fetters
of
ages
and
having
burst
them
it
seemed
to
revel
in
its
liberty
it
is
well
known
that
after
a
few
days
of
idle
precaution
and
specious
imprisonment
on
both
sides
francis
one
morning
mounted
his
horse
and
appeared
without
guards
or
any
previous
notice
before
the
tent
of
henry
the
example
was
contagious
and
from
this
time
all
ceremony
was
laid
aside
the
kings
themselves
entered
personally
into
the
combats
of
their
subjects
it
was
a
delightful
and
a
ravishing
spectacle
to
witness
the
freedom
of
the
old
roman
manners
almost
of
the
old
roman
saturnalia
polished
and
refined
with
all
that
was
graceful
and
humane
in
the
age
of
chivalry
it
may
easily
be
imagined
what
an
effect
a
scene
like
this
was
calculated
to
produce
upon
a
youth
of
my
age
and
my
education
i
recollected
with
anguish
that
the
immaturity
of
my
years
precluded
me
from
taking
any
active
part
in
the
spectacle
my
appearance
however
was
sufficiently
advantageous
i
was
presented
to
francis
the
first
he
did
me
the
honour
to
question
me
respecting
my
studies
and
finding
in
me
some
knowledge
of
those
arts
and
that
literature
of
which
he
was
himself
so
zealous
a
favourer
he
expressed
to
my
uncle
a
great
satisfaction
with
my
figure
and
acquisitions
i
might
from
this
time
have
been
taken
to
court
and
made
one
of
the
pages
to
this
illustrious
monarch
but
the
plan
of
my
mother
was
different
she
did
not
wish
for
the
present
that
my
eye
should
be
satiated
with
public
scenes
or
that
the
public
should
grow
too
familiarly
acquainted
with
my
person
she
rightly
judged
that
my
passion
for
the
theatre
of
glory
would
grow
more
impetuous
by
being
withheld
for
some
time
from
the
gratifications
for
which
it
panted
she
wished
that
i
should
present
myself
for
the
first
time
among
the
nobility
of
france
an
accomplished
cavalier
and
not
suffer
the
disadvantage
of
having
exposed
in
the
eye
of
the
world
those
false
steps
and
frailties
from
which
the
inexperience
of
youth
is
never
entirely
free
these
motives
being
explained
to
the
king
he
was
graciously
pleased
to
sanction
them
with
his
approbation
i
accordingly
returned
to
finish
the
course
of
my
education
at
my
paternal
château
upon
the
banks
of
the
garonne
the
state
of
my
mind
during
the
three
succeeding
years
amply
justified
the
sagacity
of
my
mother
i
was
more
eager
for
improvement
than
i
had
ever
yet
been
i
had
before
formed
some
conceptions
of
the
career
of
honour
from
the
books
i
had
read
and
from
the
conversation
of
this
excellent
matron
but
my
reveries
were
impotent
and
little
compared
with
what
i
had
now
seen
like
the
author
of
our
holy
religion
i
had
spent
my
forty
days
without
food
in
the
wilderness
when
suddenly
my
eyes
were
opened
and
i
was
presented
with
all
the
kingdoms
of
the
world
and
all
the
glory
of
them
the
fairy
scene
continued
for
a
moment
and
then
vanished
leaving
nothing
behind
it
on
all
sides
but
the
same
barrenness
and
gloom
by
which
it
had
been
preceded
i
never
shut
my
eyes
without
viewing
in
imagination
the
combats
of
knights
and
the
train
of
ladies
i
had
been
regarded
with
distinction
by
my
sovereign
and
francis
the
first
stood
before
my
mind
the
abstract
and
model
of
perfection
and
greatness
i
congratulated
myself
upon
being
born
in
an
age
and
country
so
favourable
to
the
acquisition
of
all
that
my
soul
desired
i
was
already
eighteen
years
of
age
when
i
experienced
the
first
misfortune
that
ever
befel
me
it
was
the
death
of
my
mother
she
felt
the
approach
of
her
dissolution
several
weeks
before
it
arrived
and
held
repeated
conversations
with
me
respecting
the
feelings
i
ought
to
entertain
and
the
conduct
it
would
become
me
to
pursue
when
she
should
be
no
more
my
son
said
she
your
character
and
the
promise
of
your
early
years
have
constituted
my
only
consolation
since
the
death
of
your
excellent
father
our
marriage
was
the
result
of
a
most
sincere
and
exclusive
attachment
and
never
did
man
more
deserve
to
be
loved
than
reginald
de
leon
when
he
died
the
whole
world
would
have
been
nothing
to
me
but
one
vast
blank
if
he
had
not
left
behind
him
the
representative
of
his
person
and
the
heir
to
his
virtues
while
i
was
busied
in
your
education
i
seemed
to
be
discharging
the
last
duty
to
the
memory
of
my
husband
the
occupation
was
sacred
to
the
honour
of
the
dead
even
before
it
became
so
peculiarly
pleasing
to
me
upon
its
own
account
as
i
afterwards
found
it
i
hope
i
have
in
some
measure
discharged
the
task
in
the
manner
in
which
my
lord
your
father
would
have
wished
it
to
have
been
discharged
if
he
had
lived
i
am
thankful
to
heaven
that
i
have
been
spared
so
long
for
so
dear
and
honourable
a
purpose
you
must
now
my
son
stand
by
yourself
and
be
the
arbitrator
of
your
own
actions
i
could
have
wished
that
this
necessity
might
have
been
a
little
further
deferred
but
i
trust
your
education
has
not
been
of
that
sort
which
is
calculated
to
render
a
young
man
helpless
and
contemptible
you
have
been
taught
to
know
your
rank
in
society
and
to
respect
yourself
you
have
been
instructed
in
every
thing
that
might
most
effectually
forward
you
in
the
career
of
glory
there
is
not
a
young
cavalier
among
all
the
nobility
of
france
more
accomplished
or
that
promises
to
do
greater
honour
to
his
name
and
his
country
i
shall
not
live
to
witness
the
performance
of
this
promise
but
the
anticipation
even
now
pours
a
long
stream
of
sunshine
on
my
departing
hour
farewell
my
son
you
no
longer
stand
in
need
of
my
maternal
care
when
i
am
gone
you
will
be
compelled
more
vividly
to
feel
that
singleness
and
which
are
the
source
of
all
virtue
be
careful
of
yourself
be
careful
that
your
career
may
be
both
spotless
and
illustrious
hold
your
life
as
a
thing
of
no
account
when
it
enters
into
competition
with
your
fame
a
true
knight
thinks
no
sacrifice
and
suffering
hard
that
honour
demands
be
humane
gentle
generous
and
intrepid
be
prompt
to
follow
wherever
your
duty
calls
you
remember
your
ancestors
knights
of
the
holy
cross
remember
your
father
follow
your
king
who
is
the
mirror
of
valour
and
be
ever
ready
for
the
service
of
the
distressed
may
providence
be
your
guardian
may
heaven
shower
down
a
thousand
blessings
upon
your
innocence
and
the
gallantry
of
your
soul
the
death
of
my
mother
was
a
severe
blow
to
my
heart
for
some
time
all
the
visions
of
greatness
and
renown
which
had
hitherto
been
my
chosen
delight
appeared
distasteful
to
me
i
hung
over
her
insensible
corpse
when
it
had
been
committed
to
the
earth
i
repaired
every
day
to
the
spot
where
it
was
deposited
at
the
hour
of
dusk
when
all
visible
objects
faded
from
the
eye
when
nature
assumed
her
saddest
tints
and
the
whole
world
seemed
about
to
be
wrapped
in
the
darkness
of
the
tomb
the
dew
of
night
drizzled
unheeded
on
my
head
and
i
did
not
turn
again
towards
the
turrets
of
the
château
till
the
hour
of
midnight
had
already
sounded
through
the
stillness
of
the
scene
time
is
the
healer
of
almost
every
grief
particularly
in
the
sprightly
season
of
early
youth
in
no
long
period
i
changed
the
oppression
of
inactive
sorrow
for
the
affectionate
and
pious
recollection
of
my
mother
s
last
instructions
i
had
been
too
deeply
imbued
with
sentiments
of
glory
for
it
to
be
possible
when
the
first
excess
of
grief
was
over
that
i
should
remain
in
indolence
the
tender
remembrance
of
my
mother
itself
in
no
long
time
furnished
a
new
stimulus
to
my
ambition
i
forgot
the
melancholy
spectacle
of
the
last
struggles
of
her
expiring
life
i
even
became
accustomed
no
longer
to
hear
her
voice
no
longer
to
expect
her
presence
when
i
returned
to
the
château
from
a
short
excursion
her
last
advice
was
now
all
that
survived
of
the
author
of
my
existence
chapter
ii
i
was
in
this
state
of
mind
when
early
one
morning
in
the
beginning
of
summer
soon
after
i
rose
i
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
trumpets
in
the
plain
near
the
château
the
bugle
at
the
gate
was
presently
sounded
the
drawbridge
was
let
down
and
the
marquis
de
villeroy
entered
the
accompanied
by
about
thirty
knights
in
complete
armour
i
saluted
him
with
respect
and
the
tenderness
excited
by
recent
grief
he
took
me
by
the
hand
after
a
short
repast
in
the
hall
and
led
me
to
my
closet
my
son
said
he
it
is
time
to
throw
off
the
effeminacy
of
sorrow
and
to
prove
yourself
a
true
soldier
of
the
standard
of
i
trust
my
lord
replied
i
with
modest
earnestness
that
you
well
know
there
is
nothing
after
which
my
heart
so
ardently
aspires
there
is
nothing
that
i
know
worth
living
for
but
honour
show
me
the
path
that
leads
to
it
or
rather
show
me
the
occasion
that
affords
scope
for
the
love
of
honour
to
display
itself
and
you
shall
then
see
whether
i
am
backward
to
embrace
it
i
have
a
passion
pent
up
within
me
that
feeds
upon
my
vitals
it
disdains
speech
it
burns
for
something
more
unambiguous
and
it
is
well
rejoined
my
uncle
i
expected
to
find
you
thus
your
reply
to
my
admonition
is
worthy
of
the
blood
of
your
ancestors
and
of
the
maternal
instructions
of
my
sister
and
were
you
as
dull
as
the
very
stones
you
tread
on
what
i
have
to
tell
you
might
even
then
rouse
you
into
animation
and
after
this
short
preface
my
uncle
proceeded
to
relate
a
tale
every
word
of
which
inflamed
my
spirits
and
raised
all
my
passions
in
arms
i
had
heard
something
imperfectly
of
the
state
of
my
country
but
my
mother
carefully
kept
me
in
ignorance
that
my
ambition
might
not
be
excited
too
soon
and
that
when
excited
it
might
be
with
the
fullest
effect
while
i
impatiently
longed
for
an
occasion
of
glory
i
was
far
from
apprehending
what
i
now
found
to
be
true
that
the
occasion
which
at
this
period
presented
itself
was
such
that
all
the
licence
of
fiction
could
scarcely
have
improved
it
the
marquis
de
villeroy
described
to
me
the
league
now
subsisting
against
france
he
revived
in
my
memory
by
terms
of
the
most
fervent
loyalty
the
accomplishments
and
talents
of
my
royal
master
he
spoke
with
aversion
of
the
phlegmatic
and
crafty
disposition
of
his
imperial
rival
and
with
the
language
of
glowing
indignation
inveighed
against
the
fickleness
of
the
capricious
henry
he
described
the
train
of
disasters
which
had
at
length
induced
the
king
to
take
the
field
in
person
he
contrasted
with
great
effect
the
story
of
the
gallant
chevalier
bayard
knight
without
fear
and
without
whose
blood
was
still
fresh
in
the
plains
of
the
milanese
with
that
of
the
constable
of
bourbon
the
stain
of
chivalry
whom
inglorious
resentment
and
ungoverned
ambition
had
urged
to
join
the
enemies
of
his
country
in
neglect
of
his
loyalty
and
his
oath
he
stimulated
me
by
the
example
of
the
one
and
the
infamy
of
the
other
and
assured
me
that
there
never
was
an
opportunity
more
favourable
for
acquiring
immortal
renown
i
wanted
no
prompter
in
a
passion
of
this
sort
and
immediately
set
about
collecting
the
whole
force
of
my
clients
and
retainers
i
shook
off
the
inglorious
softness
of
my
melancholy
and
was
all
activity
and
animation
the
lessons
of
my
youth
were
now
called
into
play
i
judged
it
necessary
to
invite
the
assistance
of
some
person
of
experience
to
assist
me
in
marshalling
my
men
but
i
did
much
of
what
was
to
be
done
myself
and
i
did
it
well
it
was
my
first
employment
in
the
morning
and
the
last
that
was
witnessed
by
the
setting
sun
my
excellent
mother
had
left
my
revenues
in
the
best
order
and
i
spared
no
expense
in
the
gratification
of
my
favourite
passion
however
eager
i
felt
myself
to
take
the
field
the
desire
to
appear
in
a
manner
worthy
of
a
count
de
leon
restrained
me
and
i
did
not
join
the
royal
army
till
the
imperialists
having
broken
up
the
siege
of
marseilles
and
retreated
with
precipitation
into
italy
the
king
had
already
crossed
the
alps
entered
the
milanese
and
gained
uncontested
possession
of
the
capital
from
milan
francis
proceeded
to
pavia
glory
was
the
idol
of
his
heart
and
he
was
the
more
powerfully
excited
to
the
attack
of
that
place
because
it
was
the
strongest
and
best
fortified
post
in
the
whole
duchy
the
more
he
displayed
of
military
prowess
the
more
firmly
he
believed
he
should
fix
himself
in
his
newly
acquired
dominions
the
inhabitants
would
submit
to
him
the
more
willingly
and
the
enemy
be
less
encouraged
to
enter
into
a
fresh
contention
for
what
he
had
acquired
such
at
least
were
the
motives
that
he
assigned
for
his
proceedings
in
reality
perhaps
he
was
principally
induced
by
the
brilliancy
which
he
conceived
would
attend
on
the
undertaking
it
was
a
few
weeks
after
the
opening
of
the
siege
that
i
presented
myself
to
my
royal
master
he
received
me
with
those
winning
and
impressive
manners
by
which
he
was
so
eminently
distinguished
he
recollected
immediately
all
that
had
passed
at
our
interview
in
the
vale
of
ardres
and
warmly
expressed
the
obligations
which
france
had
at
various
times
owed
to
my
ancestors
he
spoke
with
earnest
respect
of
the
virtues
and
wisdom
of
my
mother
and
commended
the
resolution
by
which
she
had
in
former
instances
held
me
back
from
the
public
theatre
young
gentleman
said
the
king
i
doubt
not
the
gallantry
of
your
spirit
i
see
the
impatience
of
a
martial
temper
written
in
your
face
i
expect
you
to
act
in
a
manner
worthy
of
your
illustrious
race
and
of
the
instructions
of
a
woman
who
deserved
to
be
herself
a
pattern
to
all
the
matrons
of
france
fear
not
that
i
shall
suffer
your
accomplishments
to
rust
in
obscurity
i
shall
employ
you
i
shall
assign
you
the
post
of
danger
and
of
renown
fill
it
nobly
and
from
that
hour
i
shall
rank
you
in
the
catalogue
of
my
chosen
the
siege
of
pavia
proved
indeed
to
be
a
transaction
in
the
course
of
which
military
honour
might
well
be
acquired
it
was
defended
by
a
small
but
veteran
garrison
and
by
one
of
the
ablest
captains
that
europe
at
that
time
possessed
he
interrupted
the
approaches
of
the
besiegers
by
frequent
and
furious
sallies
in
vain
by
the
aid
of
our
excellent
artillery
did
we
make
wide
and
repeated
breaches
in
the
fortifications
no
sooner
did
we
attempt
to
enter
by
the
passage
we
had
opened
than
we
found
ourselves
encountered
by
a
body
composed
of
the
choicest
and
bravest
soldiers
of
the
garrison
the
governor
of
the
city
who
though
and
advanced
in
years
was
profuse
of
every
youthful
exertion
was
ordinarily
at
the
head
of
this
body
if
we
deferred
our
attack
or
not
having
succeeded
in
it
proposed
to
commence
it
anew
with
the
dawn
of
the
following
day
we
were
sure
to
find
a
new
wall
sprung
up
in
the
room
of
the
other
as
if
by
enchantment
frequently
the
governor
anticipated
the
success
of
our
batteries
and
the
old
fortification
was
no
sooner
demolished
than
we
beheld
to
our
astonishment
and
mortification
a
new
wall
which
his
prudence
and
skill
had
erected
at
a
small
interval
within
the
line
of
the
former
one
of
these
attacks
took
place
on
the
second
day
after
my
arrival
at
the
camp
of
our
sovereign
every
thing
that
i
saw
was
new
to
me
and
inflamed
me
with
ardour
the
noise
of
the
cannon
which
had
preceded
the
attack
and
which
was
now
hushed
the
inspiring
sounds
of
martial
music
which
succeeded
that
noise
the
standards
floating
in
the
air
the
firm
and
equal
tread
of
the
battalion
that
advanced
the
armour
of
the
knights
the
rugged
resolute
and
intrepid
countenances
of
the
infantry
all
swelled
my
soul
with
transport
hitherto
unexperienced
i
had
beheld
the
smoke
of
the
artillery
in
the
midst
of
which
every
thing
was
lost
and
confounded
i
had
waited
in
awful
suspense
till
the
obscurity
should
be
dissipated
i
saw
with
pleasure
and
surprise
the
ruin
of
the
wall
and
the
wideness
of
the
breach
all
that
had
been
recorded
of
the
military
feats
of
christian
valour
seemed
then
to
stand
crowded
in
my
busy
brain
the
generosity
the
condescension
the
kindness
with
which
the
king
had
addressed
me
the
day
before
urged
me
to
treble
exertion
i
was
in
the
foremost
rank
we
surmounted
the
ditch
we
were
resisted
by
a
chosen
body
of
spaniards
the
contention
was
obstinate
brave
men
generous
and
enterprising
spirits
fell
on
the
one
side
and
the
other
i
seized
the
cloth
of
a
standard
as
in
the
playing
of
the
wind
it
was
brought
near
to
my
hand
between
me
and
the
spaniard
that
held
it
there
ensued
an
obstinate
struggle
i
watched
my
opportunity
and
with
my
sword
severed
the
flag
from
its
staff
at
this
moment
the
trumpets
of
the
king
sounded
a
retreat
i
had
received
two
severe
wounds
one
in
the
shoulder
and
the
other
in
the
thigh
in
the
contest
i
felt
myself
faint
with
the
loss
of
blood
a
french
officer
of
a
rude
appearance
and
gigantic
stature
accosting
me
with
the
appellation
of
boy
commanded
me
to
surrender
the
standard
to
him
i
refused
and
to
convince
him
i
was
in
earnest
proceeded
to
wrap
it
round
my
body
and
fastened
it
under
my
arm
soon
after
i
became
insensible
and
in
this
situation
was
accidentally
found
by
my
uncle
and
his
companions
who
immediately
took
me
and
my
prize
under
their
care
as
soon
as
i
was
a
little
recovered
of
my
wounds
the
king
seized
an
opportunity
after
having
bestowed
loud
commendations
upon
my
gallantry
of
conferring
the
honours
of
knighthood
upon
me
in
the
face
of
the
whole
army
while
our
tents
were
pitched
under
the
walls
of
pavia
i
was
continually
extending
the
circle
of
my
acquaintance
among
the
young
gentry
of
france
who
like
myself
had
attended
their
sovereign
in
this
memorable
expedition
i
had
some
enemies
made
such
by
the
distinctions
i
obtained
during
the
siege
but
they
were
few
the
greater
part
courted
me
the
more
the
more
i
showed
myself
worthy
of
their
attachment
envy
is
not
a
passion
that
finds
easy
root
in
a
frenchman
s
bosom
i
was
one
of
the
youngest
of
those
who
attended
on
the
siege
but
my
brothers
in
arms
were
generous
rivals
who
in
the
field
obstinately
strove
with
me
for
superior
glory
but
over
the
convivial
board
forgot
their
mutual
competitions
and
opened
their
hearts
to
benevolence
and
friendship
let
us
not
was
a
sentiment
i
heard
often
repeated
forget
the
object
that
led
us
from
our
pleasant
homes
to
pour
from
the
heights
of
the
alps
upon
the
fields
of
italy
it
is
to
humble
the
imperious
spaniard
to
punish
the
disloyal
bourbon
to
vindicate
the
honour
of
our
beloved
and
illustrious
monarch
those
walls
cover
the
enemy
yonder
mountains
serve
to
hide
them
from
our
assault
let
no
frenchman
mistake
him
who
marches
under
the
same
standard
for
an
the
trenches
had
not
been
opened
before
pavia
till
about
the
beginning
of
november
the
winter
overtook
us
and
the
siege
was
yet
in
progress
with
some
apparent
advantage
indeed
to
our
side
of
the
question
but
by
no
means
promising
an
instant
conclusion
the
season
set
in
with
unusual
severity
and
both
officer
and
soldier
were
glad
as
much
as
possible
to
fence
out
its
rigour
by
the
indulgences
of
the
genial
board
my
finances
as
i
have
said
were
at
the
commencement
of
the
expedition
in
excellent
order
i
had
brought
with
me
a
considerable
sum
and
it
was
not
spared
upon
the
present
occasion
there
were
however
other
things
to
be
attended
to
beside
the
demands
of
conviviality
the
king
became
impatient
of
the
delays
of
the
siege
the
garrison
and
the
inhabitants
were
reduced
to
great
extremities
but
the
governor
discovered
no
symptoms
of
a
purpose
to
surrender
in
the
mean
time
intelligence
was
brought
that
bourbon
was
making
the
most
extraordinary
exertions
in
germany
and
promised
to
lead
to
the
enemy
a
reinforcement
of
twelve
thousand
men
from
that
country
while
the
imperial
generals
by
mortgaging
their
revenues
and
pawning
their
jewels
and
still
more
by
their
eloquence
and
influence
with
those
under
their
command
were
able
to
keep
together
the
remains
of
a
disheartened
and
defeated
army
in
expectation
of
his
arrival
there
was
some
danger
therefore
if
the
siege
were
not
speedily
terminated
that
the
king
might
ultimately
be
obliged
to
raise
it
with
ignominy
or
to
fight
the
enemy
under
every
disadvantage
francis
however
was
not
to
be
deterred
from
his
undertaking
he
swore
a
solemn
oath
that
pavia
should
be
his
or
he
would
perish
in
the
attempt
thus
circumstanced
he
conceived
a
very
extraordinary
project
pavia
is
defended
on
one
side
by
the
tesino
the
scene
of
the
first
of
the
four
famous
battles
by
which
hannibal
signalised
his
invasion
of
italy
the
king
believed
that
if
this
river
could
by
the
labour
of
his
army
be
diverted
from
its
course
the
town
must
instantly
fall
into
his
hands
he
was
encouraged
to
the
undertaking
by
recollecting
a
stratagem
of
a
similar
nature
by
which
cyrus
formerly
made
himself
master
of
the
city
of
babylon
it
was
a
thought
highly
flattering
to
the
grandeur
of
his
soul
to
imagine
that
posterity
would
in
this
instance
institute
a
parallel
between
him
and
cyrus
the
great
the
plan
for
diverting
the
course
of
the
tesino
produced
a
new
and
extraordinary
scene
it
was
as
may
well
be
believed
a
work
of
uncommon
labour
a
new
channel
was
to
be
scooped
out
and
deepened
and
while
the
stream
was
turned
into
this
channel
piles
were
to
be
sunk
and
an
immense
mound
of
earth
created
as
an
effectual
impediment
to
the
waters
resuming
their
former
course
this
was
a
heavy
burthen
to
the
soldier
in
addition
to
the
disadvantage
of
being
encamped
during
the
course
of
a
winter
remarkably
severe
for
the
climate
in
which
we
fought
by
any
other
army
the
task
would
have
been
performed
with
cloudiness
and
discontent
if
not
complained
of
with
repining
and
murmurs
but
here
the
gaiety
of
the
french
character
displayed
itself
the
nobility
of
france
who
attended
their
sovereign
in
great
numbers
accompanied
the
infantry
in
their
labour
we
laid
aside
the
indulgence
of
the
marquée
of
tapestry
and
carpets
we
threw
off
our
upper
garments
and
each
seized
a
spade
a
barrow
of
earth
or
a
mattock
we
put
our
hands
to
the
engines
and
refused
no
effort
under
pretence
that
it
was
sordid
or
severe
while
the
trees
were
leafless
and
nature
appeared
bound
up
in
frost
sweat
ran
down
our
faces
and
bedewed
our
limbs
the
army
were
encouraged
by
our
example
an
employment
which
under
other
circumstances
would
have
been
regarded
as
rigid
was
thus
made
a
source
of
new
hilarity
and
amusement
it
was
a
memorable
sight
to
behold
the
venerable
and
leaders
of
the
french
army
endeavouring
to
exert
the
strength
and
activity
of
their
early
years
to
me
who
had
but
lately
arrived
at
the
stature
of
manhood
and
who
was
accustomed
to
all
the
exercises
which
give
strength
and
vigour
to
the
frame
this
new
employment
was
in
no
degree
burdensome
i
felt
in
it
the
satisfaction
that
a
swift
man
experiences
when
he
enters
the
lists
of
the
race
i
congratulated
myself
upon
the
nature
of
my
education
if
it
be
a
sin
to
covet
honour
that
guilt
was
mine
and
so
great
was
my
appetite
for
it
that
i
was
inexpressibly
rejoiced
to
observe
the
various
ways
in
which
it
might
be
gratified
strange
as
it
may
seem
this
scene
of
a
in
the
midst
of
blood
and
sweat
surrounded
with
dangers
and
called
on
for
unparalleled
exertions
appears
to
me
through
the
vista
of
years
that
is
now
interposed
between
to
have
been
one
of
the
happiest
of
my
life
the
gay
labours
and
surprises
of
the
day
were
succeeded
by
a
convivial
evening
in
which
we
did
not
the
less
open
our
hearts
though
frequently
liable
to
be
interrupted
in
our
midnight
revels
by
the
inexhaustible
activity
and
stratagems
of
the
enemy
in
this
various
and
scene
i
forgot
the
disasters
that
occurred
and
the
blood
that
flowed
around
me
all
sense
of
a
large
and
impartial
morality
was
for
the
time
at
least
deadened
in
my
breast
i
was
ever
upon
the
alert
the
diversity
of
events
neither
suffered
my
spirits
to
flag
nor
reflection
to
awake
it
is
only
upon
such
occasions
or
occasions
like
these
that
a
man
is
able
fully
to
feel
what
life
is
and
to
revel
in
its
exuberance
above
all
i
was
delighted
with
the
society
and
friendship
of
my
they
honoured
me
they
loved
me
i
seemed
to
feel
what
sympathy
was
and
to
have
conscious
pleasure
in
making
one
in
a
race
of
beings
like
myself
such
were
my
sensations
it
must
not
however
be
imagined
that
all
about
me
felt
in
these
respects
as
i
did
i
was
deeply
indebted
in
this
particular
to
my
youth
and
my
fortune
the
old
endeavoured
to
brace
themselves
in
vain
they
sunk
under
the
continual
pressure
the
poor
soldier
from
the
ranks
laboured
incessantly
and
i
laboured
as
much
as
he
but
he
had
little
opportunity
to
recruit
his
vigour
and
renovate
his
strength
there
was
yet
another
class
of
persons
in
the
camp
whose
gaiety
was
much
less
interrupted
than
mine
these
were
the
king
and
the
generals
who
commanded
under
him
they
could
not
be
entirely
devoid
of
thought
and
consideration
they
suffered
much
anxiety
from
the
length
of
the
siege
and
felt
that
every
period
of
delay
increased
the
doubtfulness
of
the
event
antonio
de
leyva
governor
of
the
city
necessarily
felt
himself
alarmed
at
the
extraordinary
project
in
which
we
were
engaged
and
made
every
exertion
to
prevent
it
one
evening
the
king
sent
for
me
to
his
tent
and
told
me
in
confidence
that
the
enemy
intended
that
very
night
to
make
three
several
attacks
upon
our
mound
one
on
each
side
of
the
stream
and
one
by
means
of
boats
in
the
centre
two
of
these
he
said
were
merely
intended
as
feints
the
west
bank
of
the
tesino
was
the
point
against
which
their
principal
exertions
would
be
directed
on
that
side
he
was
resolved
to
command
in
person
the
boats
with
which
he
proposed
to
resist
their
flota
he
confided
to
one
of
the
most
famous
and
valuable
officers
of
his
army
the
detachment
on
the
east
bank
he
purposed
to
intrust
to
my
uncle
and
myself
he
observed
that
the
detachment
he
could
spare
for
that
purpose
after
having
formed
the
other
two
bodies
and
reserved
a
sufficient
number
for
the
defence
of
the
camp
and
the
works
would
be
small
and
he
warned
me
to
the
exertion
of
a
particular
vigilance
it
would
be
doubly
unfortunate
if
a
body
the
attack
upon
which
was
to
be
merely
a
feigned
one
should
nevertheless
be
routed
go
added
he
fulfil
my
expectations
deport
yourself
answerably
to
the
merit
of
your
first
achievement
and
depend
upon
it
that
you
will
prove
hereafter
one
of
the
most
eminent
supporters
of
the
martial
glory
of
the
marquis
de
villeroy
divided
our
little
force
into
two
bodies
with
the
larger
he
lay
in
wait
for
the
enemy
near
the
scene
of
the
expected
attack
the
smaller
he
confided
to
my
direction
and
placed
so
that
we
might
be
able
to
fall
upon
the
rear
of
the
as
soon
as
they
should
be
fully
engaged
with
our
comrades
in
the
situation
assigned
me
i
took
advantage
of
the
skirts
of
a
wood
which
enabled
me
to
approach
very
near
to
the
expected
route
of
our
assailants
without
being
perceived
by
them
the
night
was
extremely
dark
yet
the
vicinity
of
my
position
was
such
that
i
could
count
the
numbers
of
the
adversary
as
they
passed
along
before
my
i
was
alarmed
to
find
that
they
amounted
to
at
least
the
triple
of
what
we
had
been
taught
to
expect
they
were
no
sooner
past
than
i
despatched
to
the
king
a
young
knight
my
particular
friend
who
happened
to
be
with
me
to
urge
the
necessity
of
a
reinforcement
at
the
same
time
i
sent
a
messenger
to
my
uncle
by
a
circuitous
route
to
inform
him
of
what
i
had
observed
and
the
step
i
had
taken
and
to
entreat
him
to
defer
the
attack
as
long
as
consistently
with
propriety
it
should
be
possible
the
enemy
however
had
no
sooner
arrived
at
the
place
of
his
destination
than
the
troops
of
the
marquis
no
longer
capable
of
restraint
rushed
to
engage
the
spaniards
were
at
first
surprised
but
a
short
time
led
them
to
suspect
the
weakness
of
their
assailants
nor
was
the
assistance
i
brought
to
my
uncle
sufficient
to
turn
the
fortune
of
the
fight
we
lost
many
of
our
men
the
rest
apparently
gave
ground
and
it
was
a
vain
attempt
amidst
the
darkness
of
the
night
to
endeavour
to
restore
order
and
rally
them
to
the
assault
we
were
already
almost
completely
overpowered
when
the
succours
we
expected
reached
us
they
were
however
unable
to
distinguish
friend
from
enemy
a
storm
of
mingled
rain
and
snow
had
come
on
which
benumbed
our
limbs
drove
fiercely
in
our
faces
and
rendered
every
object
alike
viewless
the
carnage
which
in
this
situation
took
place
was
terrible
our
blows
were
struck
at
random
a
frenchman
was
not
less
dreadful
than
a
spaniard
when
the
battle
ceased
scarcely
one
of
the
enemy
was
left
alive
but
we
observed
with
astonishment
and
horror
the
number
of
the
besiegers
who
had
probably
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
been
cut
to
pieces
by
their
own
countrymen
i
am
now
arrived
at
the
period
which
put
an
end
to
the
festivity
and
jocundness
of
the
campaign
all
after
this
was
one
continued
series
of
disaster
about
the
close
of
january
our
work
though
not
wholly
interrupted
was
considerably
retarded
by
a
succession
of
heavy
rains
this
was
injurious
to
us
in
many
ways
our
project
which
was
executed
in
the
midst
of
waters
rendered
additional
damp
a
matter
of
serious
consideration
we
were
also
seized
with
an
apprehension
of
still
greater
magnitude
which
was
speedily
realised
the
snows
being
at
length
completely
dissolved
and
the
quantity
of
water
continually
increasing
we
perceived
one
afternoon
strong
symptoms
that
our
mound
the
principal
subject
of
our
labour
and
source
of
our
hope
was
giving
way
in
various
places
the
next
morning
at
daybreak
it
rushed
down
every
where
at
once
with
wonderful
violence
and
noise
it
is
difficult
to
describe
the
sensation
of
anguish
which
was
instantly
and
universally
diffused
the
labour
of
many
weeks
was
overthrown
in
a
moment
as
we
had
proceeded
in
our
work
we
every
day
saw
ourselves
nearer
the
object
to
which
we
aspired
at
this
time
our
project
was
almost
completed
and
pavia
was
in
imagination
already
in
our
hands
to
gain
possession
of
which
had
cost
us
such
unremitted
exertions
the
display
of
so
much
gallantry
and
the
loss
of
so
many
soldiers
we
were
confounded
at
the
catastrophe
we
saw
we
gazed
at
each
other
each
in
want
of
encouragement
and
every
one
unable
to
afford
it
still
however
we
were
not
destitute
of
advantages
the
garrison
began
to
be
in
want
both
of
ammunition
and
provisions
they
were
in
a
general
state
of
discontent
almost
of
mutiny
which
scarcely
all
the
address
and
authority
of
the
governor
were
able
to
suppress
if
the
town
continued
longer
unrelieved
it
was
sure
to
fall
into
our
hands
but
even
this
our
last
hope
was
considerably
diminished
by
the
intelligence
we
received
the
very
day
after
the
destruction
of
our
mound
that
the
imperial
army
after
having
received
large
reinforcements
was
approaching
in
considerable
force
the
king
had
some
time
before
in
the
height
of
his
confidence
and
elation
of
his
heart
sent
off
a
detachment
of
six
thousand
men
to
invade
the
kingdom
of
naples
for
upon
that
as
well
as
the
milanese
he
had
inherited
pretensions
from
his
immediate
predecessors
but
though
the
enemy
was
superior
in
numbers
and
a
part
perhaps
of
their
forces
better
disciplined
than
ours
they
laboured
under
several
disadvantages
to
which
we
were
not
exposed
the
emperor
though
his
dominions
were
more
extensive
did
not
derive
from
them
a
revenue
equal
to
that
of
francis
as
he
did
not
take
the
field
in
person
the
war
appeared
to
his
subjects
only
a
common
war
proceeding
upon
the
ordinary
motives
of
war
but
my
countrymen
were
led
by
their
sovereign
were
fresh
from
the
recent
insolence
of
an
invasion
of
their
own
territory
and
fought
at
once
for
personal
glory
and
their
country
s
honour
the
king
who
commanded
them
seemed
expressly
formed
to
obtain
their
attachment
and
affection
his
nobles
became
enthusiastic
by
the
example
of
his
enthusiasm
and
willingly
disbursed
their
revenues
to
give
prosperity
and
éclat
to
the
campaign
the
first
question
that
arose
upon
the
approach
of
the
enemy
was
whether
we
should
break
up
the
siege
and
attend
in
some
strong
post
the
slow
but
sure
effect
of
their
want
of
money
and
the
consequent
dispersion
of
their
troops
or
wait
their
attack
in
our
present
posture
the
former
advice
was
safe
but
to
the
gallant
spirit
of
francis
it
appeared
ignominious
he
was
upon
all
occasions
the
partisan
of
rapid
measures
and
decisive
proceedings
and
his
temper
with
the
exception
of
a
few
wary
and
deliberate
counsellors
accorded
with
that
of
our
whole
army
for
some
days
we
congratulated
ourselves
upon
the
wisdom
of
our
choice
we
presented
to
the
enemy
so
formidable
an
appearance
that
notwithstanding
the
cogent
motives
he
had
to
proceed
he
hesitated
long
before
he
ventured
to
attack
us
at
length
however
the
day
came
that
was
pregnant
with
so
momentous
expectation
if
through
the
whole
limits
of
our
camp
there
was
not
a
man
that
did
not
feel
himself
roused
upon
this
glorious
occasion
to
me
it
was
especially
interesting
the
scene
accorded
with
the
whole
purpose
of
my
education
and
novelty
made
it
impressive
i
lived
only
in
the
present
moment
i
had
not
a
thought
a
wish
a
straggling
imagination
that
wandered
beyond
the
circuit
of
the
day
my
soul
was
filled
at
one
minute
wild
with
expectation
and
at
another
awed
into
solemnity
there
is
something
indescribably
delicious
in
this
concentration
of
the
mind
it
raises
a
man
above
himself
and
makes
him
feel
a
certain
nobleness
and
elevation
of
character
of
the
possession
of
which
he
was
to
that
hour
unconscious
fear
and
pain
were
ideas
that
could
find
no
harbour
in
my
bosom
i
regarded
this
as
the
most
memorable
of
days
and
myself
as
the
most
fortunate
of
mortals
far
indeed
was
i
from
anticipating
the
disgraceful
event
in
which
this
elation
of
heart
speedily
terminated
the
sun
rose
bright
in
a
cloudless
sky
the
cold
of
the
season
was
such
as
only
to
give
new
lightness
and
elasticity
to
the
muscles
and
animal
spirits
i
saw
few
of
those
objects
of
nature
which
in
this
delightful
climate
gave
so
sacred
a
pleasure
to
the
human
soul
but
in
my
present
temper
there
was
no
object
of
sight
so
ravishing
as
the
firm
and
equal
steps
of
the
martial
bands
the
impatience
of
the
and
the
display
of
military
standards
nor
any
music
so
enchanting
as
the
shrillness
of
the
pipe
the
clangor
of
the
trumpet
the
neighing
of
steeds
and
the
roaring
of
cannon
it
is
thus
that
man
disguises
to
himself
the
real
nature
of
his
occupation
and
clothes
that
which
is
of
all
things
the
most
nefarious
or
most
to
be
lamented
with
the
semblance
of
jubilee
and
festival
the
imperialists
were
at
first
unable
to
withstand
the
efforts
of
french
valour
they
gave
way
on
every
side
we
pursued
our
advantage
with
impetuosity
to
the
slaughter
of
whole
ranks
mowed
down
with
tremendous
celerity
to
the
agonies
of
the
dying
i
was
blind
their
groans
had
no
effect
on
my
organ
for
my
soul
was
occupied
in
another
direction
my
horse
s
heels
spurned
their
mangled
limbs
and
were
red
with
their
blood
i
fought
not
merely
with
valour
but
with
fury
i
animated
those
around
me
by
my
example
and
my
acclamations
it
may
seem
contrary
to
delicacy
to
speak
with
this
freedom
of
my
own
praises
but
i
am
at
my
present
writing
totally
changed
and
removed
from
what
i
was
and
i
write
with
the
freedom
of
a
general
historian
it
is
this
simplicity
and
ingenuousness
that
shall
pervade
the
whole
of
my
narrative
the
fortune
of
the
day
speedily
changed
the
cowardice
and
desertion
of
our
swiss
allies
gave
the
first
signal
of
adversity
the
gallant
commander
of
the
garrison
of
pavia
sallied
out
in
the
midst
of
the
fight
and
suddenly
attacked
us
in
the
rear
a
stratagem
of
the
imperial
general
effected
the
rout
of
our
cavalry
the
whole
face
of
the
field
was
utterly
reversed
it
would
be
in
vain
for
me
to
attempt
to
describe
even
the
small
part
that
i
beheld
of
the
calamity
and
slaughter
of
the
french
army
at
this
distance
of
time
the
recollection
of
it
opens
afresh
the
almost
obliterated
wounds
of
my
heart
i
saw
my
friends
cut
down
and
perish
on
every
side
those
who
together
with
myself
had
marched
out
in
the
morning
swelled
with
exultation
and
hope
now
lay
weltering
in
their
blood
their
desires
their
thoughts
their
existence
were
brought
to
a
fatal
termination
the
common
soldiers
were
hewed
and
cut
to
pieces
by
hundreds
without
note
and
observation
many
of
the
first
nobility
of
france
made
desperate
by
the
change
of
the
battle
rushed
into
the
thickest
of
the
foe
and
became
so
many
voluntary
sacrifices
choosing
rather
to
perish
than
to
turn
their
backs
with
dishonour
in
the
battle
i
had
two
horses
killed
under
me
the
first
of
them
suffered
a
sort
of
gradual
destruction
he
had
already
received
one
wound
in
the
nostrils
and
another
in
the
neck
when
a
third
shot
carried
away
two
of
his
feet
and
laid
him
prostrate
on
the
earth
bernardin
my
faithful
attendant
observed
what
was
passing
and
immediately
brought
me
a
fresh
charger
but
i
had
not
long
mounted
him
when
he
received
a
wound
which
killed
him
on
the
spot
i
was
myself
hurt
in
several
places
and
at
length
the
stroke
of
a
sabre
brought
me
to
the
ground
here
i
remained
for
a
long
time
insensible
when
i
recovered
and
looked
around
me
i
found
myself
in
entire
solitude
and
could
at
present
perceive
no
trace
either
of
the
enemy
or
of
my
own
people
soon
however
i
recollected
what
had
passed
and
was
but
too
well
assured
of
the
defeat
my
countrymen
had
sustained
weak
and
battered
as
i
was
i
attempted
to
retire
to
a
place
of
greater
security
i
had
scarcely
changed
my
ground
before
i
saw
a
trooper
of
the
enemy
rushing
towards
me
with
the
intention
to
take
away
my
life
fortunately
i
observed
a
tree
at
hand
to
the
shelter
of
which
i
hastened
and
partly
by
moving
the
branches
to
and
fro
and
partly
by
shifting
my
position
i
baffled
my
adversary
till
he
became
weary
of
the
attempt
a
moment
after
i
saw
one
of
my
most
intimate
and
familiar
companions
killed
before
my
eyes
it
was
not
long
however
before
a
party
of
fugitive
french
came
up
to
the
spot
where
i
stood
and
i
like
the
rest
was
hurried
from
the
field
my
uncle
perished
in
the
battle
it
is
wonderful
how
men
can
harden
their
hearts
against
such
scenes
as
i
then
witnessed
it
is
wonderful
how
they
can
be
brought
to
in
such
demoniac
fury
and
more
than
demoniac
mischief
barbarity
and
murder
but
they
are
brought
to
it
and
enter
not
from
a
deplorable
necessity
but
as
to
a
festival
in
which
each
man
is
eager
to
occupy
his
place
and
share
the
amusements
it
seemed
to
me
at
that
time
as
it
seems
to
me
now
that
it
should
be
enough
for
a
man
to
contemplate
such
a
field
as
i
saw
at
pavia
to
induce
him
to
abjure
the
trade
of
violence
for
ever
and
to
commit
his
sword
once
more
to
the
bowels
of
the
earth
from
which
it
was
torn
for
so
nefarious
a
purpose
these
sensations
though
now
finally
established
in
my
mind
were
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
but
of
fleeting
duration
the
force
of
education
and
the
first
bent
of
my
mind
were
too
strong
the
horror
which
overwhelmed
me
in
the
first
moments
of
this
great
national
defeat
subsided
and
the
military
passion
returned
upon
me
in
its
original
ardour
my
convictions
and
the
moral
integrity
of
my
soul
were
temporary
and
i
became
myself
a
monument
of
that
inconstancy
and
that
wonder
to
which
i
have
just
alluded
various
circumstances
however
prevented
this
passion
from
its
direct
operation
the
character
of
france
was
altered
by
the
battle
of
pavia
though
mine
remained
the
same
it
was
in
the
fullest
degree
decisive
of
the
fortune
of
the
war
milan
and
every
other
place
in
the
duchy
opened
their
gates
to
the
conqueror
and
in
a
fortnight
not
a
frenchman
was
left
in
the
fields
of
italy
of
the
whole
army
only
a
small
body
effected
an
orderly
retreat
under
the
command
of
the
duke
of
alençon
many
persons
of
the
highest
distinction
perished
in
the
battle
many
were
made
prisoners
by
the
enemy
france
by
this
event
found
the
list
of
her
noblesse
considerably
reduced
in
numbers
add
to
which
those
whose
loss
she
sustained
were
almost
all
of
them
taken
from
among
the
most
distinguished
and
meritorious
in
the
catalogue
but
what
constituted
the
principal
feature
in
this
memorable
event
was
that
the
king
himself
was
found
in
the
number
of
the
prisoners
nor
was
he
released
by
his
ungenerous
competitor
till
after
more
than
a
twelvemonth
s
confinement
during
this
period
francis
tasted
of
the
dregs
of
adversity
inclined
in
the
first
instance
to
judge
of
his
rival
by
himself
he
expected
a
liberal
treatment
in
this
he
was
deeply
disappointed
after
a
detention
of
many
months
in
the
milanese
the
scene
of
his
former
successes
he
was
transferred
to
madrid
he
was
personally
neglected
by
the
emperor
while
his
disloyal
subject
was
treated
with
singular
distinction
the
most
rigorous
terms
were
proposed
to
him
all
this
had
the
effect
in
one
instance
of
sinking
him
into
a
disease
of
languor
and
dejection
which
he
was
not
expected
to
survive
and
in
another
of
inducing
him
to
execute
an
instrument
by
which
he
abdicated
the
crown
and
declared
his
resolution
of
remaining
a
prisoner
for
life
his
confinement
was
at
length
terminated
by
his
solemnly
engaging
to
compulsory
articles
which
he
was
determined
to
break
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
at
liberty
an
alternative
peculiarly
grating
to
the
liberality
of
his
spirit
this
reverse
of
fortune
materially
changed
his
character
the
fine
spirit
of
his
ambition
was
from
this
time
evaporated
and
while
he
still
retained
the
indefeasible
qualities
of
his
soul
and
was
gallant
and
generous
he
bartered
as
far
as
was
compatible
with
his
disposition
the
enterprising
and
audacious
temper
he
had
previously
manifested
for
the
wary
and
phlegmatic
system
of
his
more
fortunate
competitor
his
genius
cowered
before
that
of
charles
and
the
defeat
of
pavia
may
perhaps
be
considered
as
having
given
a
deadly
wound
to
the
reign
of
chivalry
and
a
secure
foundation
to
that
of
craft
dissimulation
corruption
and
commerce
chapter
iii
the
lists
of
military
ambition
then
being
closed
if
not
permanently
at
least
for
a
time
my
mind
took
a
new
bias
and
without
dismissing
its
most
cherished
and
darling
passion
pursued
a
path
in
the
present
emergency
to
which
the
accidents
of
my
youth
had
also
guided
me
if
my
mother
had
survived
she
would
probably
either
not
have
consented
to
my
serving
at
the
siege
of
pavia
or
at
least
would
have
recalled
me
to
the
obscurity
of
my
paternal
château
as
soon
as
the
campaign
was
at
an
end
i
had
not
fully
completed
the
twentieth
year
of
my
age
at
the
period
of
the
memorable
battle
in
which
my
sovereign
was
made
prisoner
i
was
left
without
adviser
or
guide
even
the
marquis
de
villeroy
my
mother
s
brother
of
whatever
consequence
his
admonitions
to
me
might
have
proved
was
taken
from
me
in
this
fatal
engagement
the
king
himself
perhaps
had
it
not
been
for
the
dreadful
calamities
in
which
he
was
now
involved
might
have
condescended
to
interest
himself
in
some
degree
in
my
welfare
by
the
course
of
events
i
was
left
yet
a
minor
and
with
an
ample
revenue
at
my
disposition
to
be
wholly
guided
by
the
suggestions
of
my
own
mind
in
the
portion
of
his
reign
already
elapsed
the
splendid
and
interesting
qualities
of
francis
had
given
a
new
spring
to
the
sentiments
of
the
nation
he
was
the
most
accomplished
and
amiable
prince
of
the
time
in
which
he
lived
there
was
but
one
of
all
the
sovereigns
of
christendom
that
could
cope
with
him
in
power
the
emperor
charles
and
as
charles
s
peculiarities
were
of
a
sort
that
frenchmen
were
accustomed
to
regard
with
aversion
and
contempt
so
there
had
not
been
a
doubt
among
my
compatriots
of
the
side
upon
which
the
superiority
would
ultimately
rest
by
the
events
of
the
day
of
pavia
they
were
confounded
and
overwhelmed
they
did
not
despair
of
their
country
they
soon
felt
and
felt
to
its
utmost
extent
the
rank
which
france
held
among
the
european
states
but
the
chain
of
their
ideas
was
interrupted
they
could
not
but
be
conscious
that
the
fortune
of
the
kingdom
had
received
a
grievous
check
the
illustrious
career
which
they
had
in
fancy
already
traversed
was
postponed
to
a
distant
period
the
consequences
which
flow
from
a
suppressed
ambition
may
easily
be
imagined
the
nobility
of
france
exchanged
the
activity
of
the
field
for
the
indulgences
of
the
table
that
concentrated
spirit
which
had
sought
to
expand
itself
upon
the
widest
stage
now
found
vent
in
the
exhibition
of
individual
expense
and
above
all
the
sordid
and
inglorious
passion
for
gaming
a
vice
eminently
characteristic
of
the
age
now
especially
gained
strength
and
drew
multitudes
into
its
destructive
vortex
it
was
perhaps
impossible
for
a
young
man
to
have
entered
the
theatre
of
the
world
under
less
favourable
auspices
in
what
i
have
already
written
i
felt
myself
prompted
to
enlarge
with
complacency
upon
the
sentiments
and
scenes
of
my
youth
and
i
have
yielded
to
the
suggestion
the
same
internal
admonition
makes
me
shrink
from
entering
with
minuteness
into
the
detail
of
my
ruin
i
recollect
my
infatuation
with
abhorrence
i
fly
from
the
memory
with
sensations
inexpressibly
painful
i
regard
it
as
a
cloud
that
overshadowed
and
blackened
for
ever
the
fair
prospects
of
my
earlier
years
i
shall
not
enumerate
all
my
youthful
companions
or
all
my
youthful
follies
i
committed
a
mistake
obvious
enough
at
this
immature
period
of
my
existence
when
i
mistook
profusion
and
extravagance
for
splendour
and
dignity
and
the
prudent
economy
which
my
mother
had
practised
served
in
the
present
instance
as
the
pander
to
my
vices
the
whole
tendency
of
my
education
had
been
to
inspire
me
with
a
proud
and
restless
desire
of
distinction
and
i
was
not
content
to
play
a
second
part
in
the
career
of
my
vices
as
i
should
not
have
been
content
to
play
a
second
part
in
the
genuine
theatre
of
honour
and
fame
in
all
that
was
thoughtlessly
spirited
and
gaily
profligate
i
led
the
way
to
my
compeers
and
was
constantly
held
up
by
them
as
an
example
by
this
conduct
i
incurred
the
censure
of
the
rigorous
and
the
old
but
the
voice
of
censure
reached
me
much
seldomer
than
that
of
adulation
my
person
and
demeanour
were
the
topics
of
general
applause
i
was
tall
and
my
frame
was
slender
and
agile
but
with
an
appearance
of
the
fullest
health
my
countenance
was
open
commanding
and
animated
my
rank
and
situation
in
the
world
gave
me
confidence
the
fire
and
impetuosity
of
my
temper
rendered
my
gestures
easy
rapid
expressive
and
graceful
the
consequence
of
all
this
was
to
confirm
me
in
a
plan
of
life
which
i
early
laid
down
to
myself
and
from
which
i
never
in
any
instance
deviated
i
put
aside
those
rules
as
splenetic
and
hypercritical
which
confessors
preach
and
with
which
the
preceptors
of
young
men
are
accustomed
to
weary
and
alienate
the
minds
of
their
pupils
the
charge
of
being
disorderly
and
unthinking
i
despised
that
of
imprudence
even
when
meant
for
blame
sounded
in
my
ear
like
the
voice
of
encomium
but
accustomed
from
education
to
sentiments
of
honour
and
from
habit
to
the
language
of
eulogy
it
is
difficult
for
any
man
to
be
more
firmly
bent
than
i
was
to
incur
no
breath
of
dishonour
or
to
draw
the
line
more
peremptorily
between
the
follies
of
youth
and
the
aberrations
of
a
gross
and
unprincipled
spirit
it
may
be
alleged
indeed
and
with
considerable
justice
that
the
habit
of
gaming
is
an
exception
to
this
statement
it
was
with
hesitation
and
reluctance
that
i
entered
into
this
habit
i
saw
it
as
it
was
and
as
every
ingenuous
and
undebauched
mind
must
see
it
base
and
sordid
the
possession
of
some
degree
of
wealth
i
regarded
indeed
as
indispensable
to
a
man
who
would
fill
a
lofty
and
respectable
character
in
the
world
a
character
that
by
uniting
the
advantages
of
exterior
appearance
with
the
actions
of
a
hero
should
extort
the
homage
of
his
species
but
in
the
picture
i
drew
of
this
man
in
my
mind
i
considered
wealth
as
an
accident
the
attendant
on
his
birth
to
be
dispensed
with
dignity
not
to
be
adverted
to
with
minuteness
of
attention
deep
play
is
certainly
sufficiently
inconsistent
with
this
character
the
direct
purpose
of
the
gamester
is
to
transfer
money
from
the
pocket
of
his
neighbour
into
his
own
he
rouses
his
sleepy
and
wearied
attention
by
the
most
sordid
of
all
motives
the
fear
of
losing
pierces
his
heart
with
anguish
and
to
gain
to
obtain
an
advantage
for
himself
which
can
scarcely
exceed
and
which
seldom
equals
the
injury
his
competitor
suffers
is
the
circumstance
which
most
transports
his
heart
with
delight
for
this
he
watches
for
this
he
calculates
an
honourable
gamester
does
not
seize
with
premeditation
the
moment
when
his
adversary
is
deprived
by
wine
or
any
other
cause
of
his
usual
he
does
not
seek
with
sober
malice
to
play
upon
his
passions
he
does
not
enter
with
avidity
into
the
contest
with
an
unpractised
but
presuming
rival
but
he
can
not
avoid
rejoicing
when
he
finds
that
accident
has
given
him
an
unusual
advantage
i
have
often
thought
that
i
could
better
understand
how
a
man
of
honour
could
reconcile
himself
to
the
accursed
and
murderous
trade
of
war
than
to
the
system
of
the
gaming
table
in
war
he
fights
with
a
stranger
a
man
with
whom
he
has
no
habits
of
kindness
and
who
is
fairly
apprised
that
he
comes
against
him
with
ruinous
intent
but
in
play
he
robs
perhaps
his
brother
his
friend
the
partner
of
his
bosom
or
in
every
event
a
man
seduced
into
the
snare
with
all
the
arts
of
courtesy
and
whom
he
smiles
upon
even
while
he
stabs
i
am
talking
here
the
mere
reason
and
common
sense
of
the
question
as
it
relates
to
mankind
in
general
but
it
is
with
other
feelings
that
i
reflect
upon
the
concern
i
have
myself
individually
in
the
subject
years
roll
on
in
vain
ages
themselves
are
useless
here
looking
forward
as
i
do
to
an
existence
that
shall
endure
till
time
shall
be
no
more
no
time
can
wipe
away
the
remembrance
of
the
bitter
anguish
that
i
have
endured
the
consequence
of
gaming
it
is
torture
it
is
madness
poverty
i
have
drained
thy
cup
to
the
dregs
i
have
seen
my
wife
and
my
children
looking
to
me
in
vain
for
bread
which
is
the
most
intolerable
distress
that
of
the
period
in
which
all
the
comforts
of
life
gradually
left
me
in
which
i
caught
at
every
fragment
of
promise
and
every
fragment
failed
in
which
i
rose
every
morning
to
pamper
myself
with
empty
delusions
in
which
i
ate
the
apples
of
purgatory
fair
without
but
within
bitterness
and
ashes
in
which
i
tossed
through
endless
sightless
nights
upon
the
couch
of
disappointment
and
despair
or
the
period
when
at
length
all
my
hopes
were
at
an
end
when
i
fled
with
horror
to
a
foreign
climate
when
my
family
that
should
have
been
my
comfort
gave
me
my
most
poignant
agony
when
i
looked
upon
them
naked
destitute
and
exiles
with
the
tremendous
thought
what
and
who
it
was
that
had
caused
their
ruin
adversity
without
consolation
adversity
when
its
sting
is
remorse
and
hell
has
no
misery
by
which
it
can
be
thrown
into
shade
or
exceeded
why
do
i
dwell
upon
or
at
least
why
do
i
anticipate
this
detested
circumstance
of
my
story
let
me
add
one
remark
in
this
place
and
pass
on
to
the
other
particulars
of
this
epoch
of
my
prodigality
it
is
true
i
must
take
this
shameful
appellation
to
myself
i
was
a
gamester
but
in
the
beginning
i
took
no
concern
in
that
species
of
science
which
is
often
implied
in
the
appellation
my
games
were
games
of
hazard
not
of
skill
it
appeared
to
my
distempered
apprehension
to
be
only
a
mode
in
which
for
a
man
to
display
his
fortitude
and
philosophy
i
was
flattered
with
the
practice
of
gaming
because
i
saw
in
it
when
gracefully
pursued
the
magnanimity
of
the
stoic
combined
with
the
manners
of
a
man
of
the
world
a
magnanimity
that
no
success
is
able
to
intoxicate
and
no
vicissitude
to
subvert
i
committed
my
property
to
the
hazard
of
the
die
and
i
placed
my
ambition
in
laughing
alike
at
the
favours
of
fortune
and
her
frowns
in
the
sequel
however
i
found
myself
deceived
the
fickle
goddess
sufficiently
proved
that
she
had
the
power
of
making
me
serious
but
in
her
most
tremendous
reverses
i
was
never
influenced
to
do
any
thing
that
the
most
scrupulous
gamester
regards
as
dishonourable
i
say
not
this
for
the
purpose
of
giving
colour
and
speciousness
to
my
tale
i
say
it
because
i
have
laid
it
down
to
myself
in
this
narrative
as
a
sacred
principle
to
relate
the
simple
unaltered
truth
another
characteristic
of
the
reign
of
francis
the
first
is
its
gallantries
it
is
well
known
how
much
the
king
was
himself
occupied
with
attachments
of
this
sort
his
government
was
rather
the
government
of
women
than
of
politicians
and
the
manners
of
the
sovereign
strongly
tended
to
fix
the
habits
of
his
subjects
a
very
young
man
rather
takes
the
tone
of
his
passions
from
those
about
him
than
forms
one
that
is
properly
his
own
and
this
was
my
case
in
the
present
instance
as
well
as
in
the
preceding
originally
of
an
amorous
constitution
i
should
perhaps
have
quieted
the
restlessness
of
my
appetites
without
ostentation
and
éclat
had
not
the
conduct
of
my
youthful
associates
in
general
led
me
to
regard
gallantry
as
an
accomplishment
indispensably
necessary
in
a
young
man
of
rank
it
must
be
confessed
indeed
that
this
offence
against
the
rigour
of
discipline
has
a
thousand
advantages
over
that
of
gaming
few
women
of
regular
and
reputable
lives
have
that
ease
of
manners
that
flow
of
fancy
and
that
graceful
intrepidity
of
thinking
and
expressing
themselves
that
is
sometimes
to
be
found
among
those
who
have
discharged
themselves
from
the
tyranny
of
custom
there
is
something
irresistibly
captivating
in
that
voluptuousness
which
while
it
assumes
a
certain
air
of
freedom
uniformly
and
with
preference
conforms
itself
to
the
dictates
of
unsophisticated
delicacy
a
judicious
and
limited
voluptuousness
is
necessary
to
the
cultivation
of
the
mind
to
the
polishing
of
the
manners
to
the
refining
of
sentiment
and
the
developement
of
the
understanding
and
a
woman
deficient
in
this
respect
may
be
of
use
for
the
government
of
our
families
but
can
neither
add
to
the
enjoyments
nor
fix
the
partiality
of
a
man
of
animation
and
taste
but
whatever
there
may
be
in
these
considerations
certain
it
is
that
the
conduct
i
pursued
in
matters
of
gallantry
led
me
into
great
and
serious
expenses
the
mistresses
with
whom
i
chanced
to
associate
had
neither
the
inexpressible
captivation
of
madame
de
chateaubriant
nor
the
aspiring
and
impressive
manners
of
the
duchess
d
etampes
they
had
however
beauty
and
vivacity
frolic
without
rudeness
and
softness
without
timidity
they
had
paid
some
regard
to
points
of
knowledge
and
taste
considering
these
as
additional
means
for
fixing
the
partiality
of
their
paramours
and
knowing
that
they
had
no
security
for
the
permanence
of
their
prosperity
but
in
the
variety
of
their
attractions
in
their
society
i
was
led
into
new
trains
of
reflection
a
nicer
consideration
of
human
passion
and
the
varieties
of
human
character
and
above
all
into
a
greater
quickness
and
delicacy
in
matters
of
intellectual
taste
my
hours
for
the
most
part
rolled
swiftly
and
easily
away
sometimes
in
the
society
of
the
young
the
gay
and
the
ambitious
of
my
own
sex
and
sometimes
in
the
softer
and
more
delicious
intercourse
of
the
fair
i
lived
in
the
midst
of
all
that
paris
could
at
that
time
furnish
of
splendid
and
luxurious
this
system
of
living
was
calculated
to
lull
me
in
pleasing
dreams
and
to
waste
away
existence
in
delirious
softness
it
sufficiently
accorded
with
the
sad
period
of
our
sovereign
s
captivity
when
my
young
compatriots
sought
to
drown
the
sense
of
public
and
patriotic
considerations
in
copious
draughts
of
pleasure
nor
did
the
monarch
s
return
immediately
restore
to
france
her
former
haughtiness
and
pride
the
course
of
sensuality
in
which
i
was
now
engaged
though
it
did
not
absolutely
sink
into
grossness
may
well
be
supposed
to
have
trodden
upon
the
very
edge
of
licence
i
and
my
companions
were
young
we
were
made
fearless
and
presuming
by
fortune
and
by
rank
we
had
laid
aside
those
more
rigorous
restraints
which
render
the
soberer
part
of
mankind
plausible
and
decent
by
making
them
timid
and
trite
i
will
not
contaminate
the
minds
of
my
innocent
and
inexperienced
readers
by
entering
into
the
detail
of
the
follies
in
which
i
engaged
one
thing
it
is
necessary
to
remark
as
essential
to
the
main
thread
of
my
story
my
expenses
of
all
kinds
during
this
period
of
drained
my
resources
but
did
not
tarnish
my
good
name
my
excesses
were
regarded
by
some
as
ornamental
and
becoming
but
by
all
were
admitted
as
venial
the
laurels
i
had
won
in
the
field
of
military
honour
were
not
obscured
by
my
subsequent
conduct
i
was
universally
ranked
among
the
most
promising
and
honourable
of
the
young
noblemen
of
france
i
had
some
rivals
i
did
not
pass
through
this
turbulent
and
diversified
scene
without
disputes
but
no
one
cast
a
reflection
upon
my
name
no
one
ventured
to
speak
of
me
with
superciliousness
and
opprobrium
nor
was
my
temper
more
injured
than
my
reputation
from
every
dispute
i
extricated
myself
with
grace
and
propriety
i
studied
the
pleasure
and
ease
of
all
with
whom
i
associated
and
no
man
enjoyed
more
extensively
than
i
did
the
sweets
of
friendship
as
far
as
the
sweets
of
friendship
can
be
extensively
enjoyed
chapter
iv
i
had
been
now
two
years
in
habits
of
life
and
a
mode
of
expense
extremely
injurious
to
my
patrimony
when
a
circumstance
occurred
which
promised
completely
to
deliver
me
from
the
ruinous
consequences
of
my
own
folly
this
was
no
other
than
my
encounter
with
that
incomparable
woman
who
afterwards
became
the
partner
of
my
life
and
the
mother
of
my
children
i
can
not
even
now
recollect
her
without
tears
the
sentiment
which
her
very
name
excites
in
my
mind
is
a
mingled
feeling
on
the
one
hand
of
the
most
exquisite
and
unspeakable
delight
a
feeling
that
elevates
and
expands
and
electrifies
my
throbbing
heart
and
on
the
other
of
the
bitterest
anguish
and
regret
i
must
develope
the
source
of
this
feeling
marguerite
louise
isabeau
de
damville
was
at
the
period
of
our
first
meeting
in
the
nineteenth
year
of
her
age
her
complexion
was
of
the
most
perfect
transparency
her
eyes
black
and
sparkling
and
her
eyebrows
dark
and
long
such
were
the
perfect
smoothness
and
clearness
of
her
skin
that
at
nineteen
she
appeared
five
years
younger
than
she
was
and
she
long
retained
this
extreme
juvenility
of
form
her
step
was
airy
and
light
as
that
of
a
young
fawn
yet
at
the
same
time
firm
and
indicative
of
strength
of
body
and
vigour
of
mind
her
voice
like
the
whole
of
her
external
appearance
was
expressive
of
undesigning
i
had
almost
said
childish
simplicity
yet
with
all
this
playfulness
of
appearance
her
understanding
was
bold
and
correct
her
mind
was
well
furnished
with
every
thing
that
could
add
to
her
accomplishments
as
a
wife
or
a
mother
her
indulgent
parents
had
procured
her
every
advantage
of
education
and
circumstances
had
been
uncommonly
favourable
to
her
improvement
she
was
encouraged
and
assisted
in
the
art
of
drawing
for
which
she
discovered
a
very
early
talent
by
leonardo
da
vinci
and
she
formed
her
poetical
taste
from
the
conversation
and
instructions
of
clement
marot
but
amidst
the
singular
assemblage
of
her
intellectual
accomplishments
there
was
nothing
by
which
she
was
so
much
distinguished
as
the
uncommon
prudence
of
her
judgments
and
the
unalterable
amiableness
of
her
manners
this
was
the
woman
destined
to
crown
my
happiness
and
consummate
my
misery
if
i
had
never
known
her
i
should
never
have
tasted
true
pleasure
if
i
had
been
guided
by
her
counsels
i
should
not
have
drained
to
the
very
dregs
the
cup
of
anguish
the
house
of
her
father
the
marquis
de
damville
was
the
resort
of
all
the
most
eminent
wits
and
scholars
of
that
period
particularly
of
marot
rabelais
erasmus
and
scaliger
this
was
my
first
inducement
to
frequent
it
my
education
had
inspired
me
with
an
inextinguishable
love
of
literature
and
the
dissipation
in
which
i
was
at
this
time
involved
could
not
entirely
interrupt
the
propensity
the
most
thoughtless
and
extravagant
period
of
my
life
had
occasional
intervals
of
study
and
reflection
and
the
gay
animated
and
ingenious
conversation
of
the
men
i
have
mentioned
had
always
peculiar
charms
for
me
i
had
continued
for
some
time
to
visit
at
the
marquis
s
hotel
before
i
encountered
the
beautiful
marguerite
the
first
time
i
saw
her
she
made
a
deep
impression
upon
me
the
marquis
who
was
one
of
the
most
benevolent
and
enlightened
of
mankind
had
been
led
by
my
character
and
manners
to
conceive
a
warm
friendship
for
me
he
saw
the
ruin
in
which
i
was
heedlessly
involving
myself
and
believed
that
it
was
not
yet
too
late
to
save
me
as
he
thought
that
there
was
no
method
so
likely
to
effect
my
reformation
as
the
interposition
of
domestic
affections
he
was
not
unwilling
to
encourage
the
attachment
i
began
to
feel
for
his
daughter
on
my
part
i
wanted
but
little
encouragement
i
no
sooner
observed
her
manners
and
became
acquainted
with
her
merits
than
my
heart
was
unalterably
fixed
i
became
as
it
were
a
new
man
i
was
like
one
who
after
his
eyes
had
grown
imperceptibly
dim
till
at
length
every
object
appeared
indistinct
and
of
a
gloomy
general
hue
has
his
sight
instantaneously
restored
and
beholds
the
fabric
of
the
universe
in
its
genuine
clearness
brilliancy
and
truth
i
was
astonished
at
my
own
folly
that
i
could
so
long
have
found
gratification
in
pleasures
mean
and
sensual
i
was
ashamed
of
my
own
degradation
i
could
not
endure
the
comparison
between
the
showy
unsubstantial
attractions
of
the
women
i
had
hitherto
frequented
and
the
charms
of
the
adorable
marguerite
the
purity
of
her
mind
seemed
to
give
a
celestial
brilliancy
and
softness
to
the
beauties
of
her
person
the
gross
and
brutal
pursuits
of
the
debauchee
are
often
indeed
described
by
the
same
epithets
as
the
virtuous
and
refined
passion
with
which
i
was
now
for
the
first
time
inspired
but
experience
convinced
me
that
they
differed
in
their
most
essential
features
the
marquis
saw
the
state
of
my
mind
and
addressed
me
thus
count
said
he
i
feel
the
most
ardent
friendship
for
you
i
am
inexpressibly
concerned
for
your
welfare
you
will
be
convinced
of
this
when
i
have
furnished
you
with
a
clue
to
my
late
conduct
towards
you
i
regard
you
if
not
as
a
ruined
man
at
least
as
a
man
in
the
high
road
to
ruin
your
present
habits
are
of
the
most
dangerous
sort
they
appear
to
you
perfectly
conformable
to
principles
of
the
strictest
honour
nay
they
come
recommended
to
you
by
a
certain
éclat
and
dignity
with
which
they
seem
to
be
surrounded
i
could
say
to
you
recollect
yourself
be
not
misled
by
delusive
appearances
consider
the
present
state
of
your
fortune
and
the
state
in
which
your
mother
left
it
you
can
not
be
ignorant
how
greatly
it
is
impaired
how
has
this
circumstance
arisen
have
your
revenues
been
expended
in
the
service
of
your
country
have
you
purchased
any
thing
by
them
that
will
confer
on
you
lasting
renown
put
together
the
sum
of
actions
which
piece
by
piece
you
have
been
willing
to
regard
as
indifferent
and
innocent
if
not
as
graceful
and
becoming
you
can
not
but
be
struck
with
their
monstrous
deformity
is
it
possible
that
you
can
be
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
poverty
there
is
such
a
thing
as
honourable
poverty
the
poverty
of
cincinnatus
was
honourable
who
impoverished
himself
by
paying
the
fine
which
was
factiously
imposed
on
his
son
and
then
was
contented
to
pass
his
time
alternately
between
the
highest
situations
and
the
most
rigid
simplicity
the
poverty
of
a
man
of
genius
such
as
rabelais
if
not
honourable
is
interesting
when
we
compare
his
merits
and
worth
with
that
of
many
of
those
persons
upon
whom
fortune
has
blindly
lavished
her
favours
it
is
honourable
if
he
have
declined
the
means
of
enriching
himself
by
the
sacrifice
of
his
independence
and
his
principles
but
of
all
earthly
things
the
most
contemptible
is
the
man
who
having
wasted
his
goods
in
riotous
living
yet
hungers
after
the
luxuries
that
have
proved
his
bane
and
feasts
himself
upon
the
steam
of
dainties
of
which
he
has
lost
the
substance
poverty
always
sufficiently
disadvantageous
in
a
degenerate
age
where
attention
and
courtship
are
doled
forth
with
scales
of
gold
is
tremendous
to
him
he
is
the
scorn
of
all
mankind
wherever
he
is
a
guest
he
is
invited
only
to
be
trampled
upon
and
insulted
he
is
capable
of
nothing
and
is
a
burden
to
society
and
mankind
the
helplessness
of
age
advances
upon
him
with
stealing
steps
and
he
is
destined
to
gather
all
its
miseries
and
none
of
its
consolations
i
might
have
talked
to
you
thus
but
i
refused
it
i
apprehend
something
of
the
nature
of
advice
i
know
that
it
can
seldom
be
attended
with
its
genuine
effect
and
will
never
be
received
with
deference
and
pleasure
where
its
motives
are
capable
of
misconstruction
if
i
had
talked
to
you
thus
i
might
have
appeared
to
be
indulging
the
tyranny
of
age
i
might
have
seemed
to
assume
an
unbecoming
air
of
superiority
and
command
it
could
not
have
been
clear
that
i
was
honestly
interested
in
that
about
which
i
affected
so
much
concern
i
doubt
not
the
ingenuousness
of
your
nature
i
doubt
not
that
you
would
have
been
struck
with
the
picture
but
i
must
be
permitted
to
doubt
the
adequate
and
lasting
effect
of
my
expostulation
i
was
not
willing
by
my
forwardness
and
loquacity
to
wear
out
one
of
the
great
springs
of
human
improvement
i
have
determined
on
your
reform
for
that
purpose
i
think
it
necessary
to
combine
my
remonstrances
and
advice
with
a
change
of
your
habits
and
situation
you
have
tasted
largely
of
what
are
commonly
called
the
pleasures
of
life
but
there
are
pleasures
that
you
have
not
tasted
at
this
moment
you
anticipate
them
and
anticipate
them
with
the
ardour
of
a
lover
but
you
know
not
yet
all
the
gratifications
that
attend
upon
domestic
affections
i
am
willing
to
bestow
upon
you
my
daughter
i
consent
to
prove
the
purity
of
my
advice
and
the
sincerity
of
my
regard
by
committing
her
happiness
to
the
risk
she
is
a
treasure
the
equal
of
which
perhaps
the
world
does
not
hold
i
speak
not
of
her
personal
attractions
but
in
understanding
accomplishments
and
virtue
i
firmly
believe
no
woman
living
can
compare
with
her
in
possessing
her
you
will
be
blessed
beyond
the
lot
of
princes
but
at
the
same
time
that
i
shall
thus
put
happiness
within
your
grasp
remember
that
i
commit
to
your
disposal
the
happiness
of
marguerite
you
are
a
worthy
and
an
honourable
man
your
talents
and
your
virtues
will
constitute
her
felicity
her
portion
will
redeem
the
injury
which
your
patrimony
has
suffered
from
your
excesses
and
you
will
have
enough
for
yourselves
and
for
your
mutual
offspring
i
can
not
believe
that
with
such
a
deposit
intrusted
to
you
you
will
consent
to
bring
her
to
misery
and
ruin
i
have
one
condition
however
to
stipulate
with
you
i
require
of
you
as
the
pledge
of
her
happiness
that
you
break
off
your
present
modes
of
life
that
you
separate
yourself
from
your
connections
and
retire
into
the
country
upon
your
paternal
estate
you
are
yet
too
young
to
be
in
danger
from
that
tyranny
of
custom
which
often
renders
men
more
advanced
in
life
incapable
of
relishing
the
simple
and
genuine
pleasures
you
will
find
contentment
and
joy
in
the
society
of
my
daughter
and
in
the
bosom
of
your
rising
family
you
will
be
happy
in
the
circle
of
your
own
hearth
and
have
little
to
ask
of
the
rest
of
mankind
if
in
any
and
inauspicious
moment
the
allurements
of
your
present
vices
forgive
the
plainness
of
my
speech
should
resume
their
power
over
you
i
hope
at
least
that
i
shall
never
live
to
see
it
that
i
shall
not
be
taught
by
bitter
experience
that
i
have
sacrificed
to
the
disinterestedness
of
my
friendship
the
happiness
of
my
daughter
and
of
my
posterity
my
heart
weeps
blood
while
i
record
the
admonitions
of
this
noble
and
generous
man
a
nobler
france
did
not
contain
through
all
her
boundaries
refined
by
literature
polished
by
the
best
society
his
age
could
afford
grown
grey
in
the
field
of
honour
and
particularly
distinguished
by
the
personal
attachment
and
confidence
of
his
sovereign
what
was
all
this
advice
to
me
what
return
did
i
make
to
this
unparalleled
kindness
and
friendship
i
ruined
this
admirable
woman
i
involved
her
in
poverty
and
shame
with
the
most
savage
barbarity
i
prepared
for
her
an
immature
grave
can
i
forget
this
of
what
avail
to
me
are
immortal
life
and
immortal
youth
oh
marguerite
marguerite
for
ever
thy
image
haunts
me
for
ever
thy
ghost
upbraids
me
how
little
have
i
proved
myself
worthy
of
such
a
partner
rather
what
punishment
what
plagues
what
shame
and
detestation
have
i
not
deserved
praised
be
heaven
the
last
prayer
of
the
marquis
of
damville
at
least
was
granted
he
did
not
live
to
witness
my
relapse
my
profligacy
and
insanity
i
resume
the
thread
of
my
i
listened
to
the
address
of
the
marquis
with
reverence
and
admiration
i
accepted
his
conditions
with
joy
i
married
his
adorable
daughter
and
conducted
her
to
my
paternal
estate
in
the
bourdelois
now
only
it
was
that
i
tasted
of
perfect
happiness
to
judge
from
my
own
experience
in
this
situation
i
should
say
that
nature
has
atoned
for
all
the
disasters
and
miseries
she
so
copiously
and
incessantly
pours
upon
her
sons
by
this
one
gift
the
transcendent
enjoyment
and
nameless
delights
which
wherever
the
heart
is
pure
and
the
soul
is
refined
wait
on
the
attachment
of
two
persons
of
opposite
sexes
my
beloved
marguerite
guided
and
directed
me
at
the
same
time
that
she
was
ever
studying
my
gratification
i
instructed
her
by
my
experience
while
she
enlightened
me
by
the
rectitude
and
decision
of
her
taste
ours
was
a
sober
and
dignified
happiness
and
its
very
sobriety
served
to
give
it
additional
voluptuousness
we
had
each
our
separate
pursuits
whether
for
the
cultivation
of
our
minds
or
the
promotion
of
our
mutual
interests
separation
gave
us
respectability
in
each
other
s
eyes
while
it
prepared
us
to
enter
with
fresh
ardour
into
society
and
conversation
in
company
with
each
other
hours
passed
over
us
and
appeared
but
minutes
it
has
been
said
to
be
a
peculiar
felicity
for
any
one
to
be
praised
by
a
man
who
is
himself
eminently
a
subject
of
praise
how
much
happier
to
be
prized
and
loved
by
a
person
worthy
of
love
a
man
may
be
prized
and
valued
by
his
friend
but
in
how
different
a
style
of
sentiment
from
the
regard
and
attachment
that
may
reign
in
the
bosom
of
his
mistress
or
his
wife
and
may
perhaps
be
numbered
among
the
principal
sources
of
contentment
it
is
necessary
for
him
who
would
endure
existence
with
patience
that
he
should
conceive
himself
to
be
something
that
he
should
be
persuaded
he
is
not
a
cipher
in
the
of
man
how
bitter
is
the
anguish
we
are
sometimes
doomed
to
sustain
in
this
respect
from
the
marks
we
receive
of
other
men
s
indifference
and
contempt
to
feel
that
we
are
loved
by
one
whose
love
we
have
deserved
to
be
employed
in
the
mutual
interchange
of
the
marks
of
this
love
habitually
to
study
the
happiness
of
one
by
whom
our
happiness
is
studied
in
return
this
is
the
most
desirable
as
it
is
the
genuine
and
unadulterated
condition
of
human
nature
i
must
have
some
one
to
sympathise
with
i
can
not
bear
to
be
cut
off
from
all
relations
i
desire
to
experience
a
confidence
a
concord
an
attachment
that
can
not
rise
between
common
acquaintance
in
every
state
we
long
for
some
fond
bosom
on
which
to
rest
our
weary
head
some
speaking
eye
with
which
to
exchange
the
glances
of
intelligence
and
affection
then
the
soul
warms
and
expands
itself
then
it
shuns
the
observation
of
every
other
beholder
then
it
melts
with
feelings
that
are
inexpressible
but
that
the
heart
understands
without
the
aid
of
words
then
the
eyes
swim
with
rapture
then
the
frame
languishes
with
enjoyment
then
the
soul
burns
with
fire
then
the
two
persons
thus
blest
are
no
longer
two
distance
vanishes
one
thought
animates
one
mind
informs
them
thus
love
acts
thus
it
is
ripened
to
perfection
never
does
man
feel
himself
so
much
alive
so
truly
etherial
as
when
bursting
the
bonds
of
diffidence
uncertainty
and
reserve
he
pours
himself
entire
into
the
bosom
of
the
woman
he
adores
marguerite
de
damville
was
particularly
distinguished
from
every
other
woman
i
ever
knew
by
the
justness
of
her
taste
and
the
vividness
of
her
feelings
this
circumstance
was
a
fund
of
inexhaustible
delight
and
improvement
to
me
we
were
both
of
us
well
acquainted
with
the
most
eminent
poets
and
fine
writers
of
modern
times
but
when
we
came
to
read
them
together
they
presented
themselves
in
a
point
of
view
in
which
they
had
never
been
seen
by
us
before
it
is
perhaps
more
important
that
poetry
and
every
thing
that
excites
the
imagination
or
appeals
to
the
heart
should
be
read
in
solitude
than
in
society
but
the
true
way
to
understand
our
author
in
these
cases
is
to
employ
each
of
these
modes
in
succession
the
terrible
the
majestic
the
voluptuous
and
the
melting
are
all
of
them
in
a
considerable
degree
affairs
of
sympathy
and
we
never
judge
of
them
so
infallibly
or
with
so
much
satisfaction
as
when
in
the
presence
of
each
other
the
emotion
is
kindled
in
either
bosom
at
the
same
instant
the
pregnant
with
sentiment
and
meaning
involuntarily
meet
and
mingle
the
voice
of
the
reader
becomes
modulated
by
the
ideas
of
his
author
and
that
of
the
hearer
by
an
accidental
interjection
of
momentary
comment
or
applause
confesses
its
accord
it
was
in
this
manner
that
we
read
together
the
admirable
sonnets
of
petrarch
and
passed
in
review
the
sublime
effusions
of
dante
the
letters
of
eloisa
to
abelard
afforded
us
singular
delight
we
searched
into
the
effusions
of
the
troubadours
and
among
all
their
absurdities
and
inequality
we
found
a
wildness
a
daring
pouring
forth
of
the
soul
an
unpruned
richness
of
imagination
and
from
time
to
time
a
grandeur
of
conception
and
audacious
eccentricity
of
thought
that
filled
us
with
unlooked
for
transport
at
other
times
when
not
regularly
engaged
in
this
species
of
reading
we
would
repeat
passages
to
each
other
communicate
the
discoveries
of
this
sort
that
either
had
made
in
solitude
and
point
out
unobserved
beauties
that
perhaps
neither
of
us
would
have
remarked
but
for
the
suggestions
of
the
other
it
is
impossible
for
two
persons
to
be
constituted
so
much
alike
but
that
one
of
them
should
have
a
more
genuine
and
instantaneous
relish
for
one
sort
of
excellence
and
another
for
another
thus
we
added
to
each
other
s
stores
and
acquired
a
largeness
of
conception
and
liberality
of
judgment
that
neither
of
us
would
have
arrived
at
if
separate
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
how
prolific
this
kind
of
amusement
proved
of
true
happiness
we
were
mutually
delighted
to
remark
the
accord
of
our
feelings
and
still
more
so
as
we
perceived
that
accord
to
be
hourly
increasing
and
what
struck
either
as
a
blemish
in
the
other
wearing
out
and
disappearing
we
were
also
led
by
the
same
means
to
advert
to
the
powers
of
mind
existing
in
each
the
rectitude
of
judgment
and
delicacy
of
feeling
as
our
attachment
hourly
increased
we
rejoiced
in
this
reciprocation
of
benefits
while
each
gave
or
received
something
that
added
to
value
of
mind
and
worth
of
character
mutual
esteem
was
incessantly
kept
alive
and
mutual
esteem
is
the
only
substantial
basis
of
love
each
of
us
hourly
blessed
our
common
lot
while
each
believed
it
impracticable
elsewhere
to
have
found
so
much
worth
blended
with
so
much
sweetness
but
we
did
not
confine
ourselves
to
the
library
and
fireside
we
walked
we
rode
we
travelled
together
we
observed
together
the
beauties
of
nature
and
the
system
of
the
universe
we
traversed
many
provinces
of
france
and
some
parts
of
italy
and
spain
we
examined
the
characters
of
mankind
as
they
are
modified
by
the
varieties
of
natural
descent
or
the
diversities
of
political
government
in
all
this
we
found
peculiar
gratification
there
is
something
in
the
scent
and
impression
of
a
balmy
atmosphere
in
the
lustre
of
sunshine
in
the
azure
heaven
and
the
purple
clouds
in
the
opening
of
prospects
on
this
side
and
on
that
in
the
contemplation
of
verdure
and
fertility
and
industry
and
simplicity
and
cheerfulness
in
all
their
variations
in
the
very
act
and
exercise
of
travelling
peculiarly
congenial
to
the
human
frame
it
expands
the
heart
it
makes
the
spirit
dance
and
exquisitely
disposes
us
for
social
enjoyment
the
mind
becomes
more
elevated
and
refined
it
assumes
a
microscopical
and
unwonted
sensibility
it
feels
things
which
in
ordinary
moments
are
unheeded
and
unknown
it
enjoys
things
too
evanescent
for
a
name
and
too
minute
to
be
arrested
it
trembles
with
pleasure
through
every
fibre
and
every
articulation
one
thing
is
necessary
to
be
mentioned
in
this
place
though
while
it
adds
to
the
fidelity
of
delineation
i
am
aware
it
breaks
the
tone
of
feeling
and
the
harmony
of
the
picture
but
it
is
not
my
intention
in
this
history
to
pass
myself
for
better
than
i
am
i
have
laid
down
to
myself
the
sacred
maxim
of
absolute
truth
and
impartiality
i
must
confess
therefore
with
whatever
anguish
my
extreme
inferiority
to
my
incomparable
partner
she
had
all
the
simplicity
of
genuine
taste
the
more
she
delivered
herself
up
to
nature
the
greater
was
her
content
all
superfluous
appendages
and
show
appeared
to
her
as
so
many
obstacles
to
enjoyment
she
derived
her
happiness
from
the
tone
of
her
own
mind
and
stood
in
no
need
of
the
gaping
admiration
and
stupid
wonder
of
others
to
make
her
feel
herself
happy
but
i
retained
the
original
vice
of
my
mind
the
gestures
of
worship
and
the
voice
of
applause
were
necessary
to
me
i
did
not
suffice
to
myself
i
was
not
satisfied
with
the
tranquil
and
inglorious
fruition
of
genuine
pleasures
forgetting
the
vain
and
anxious
tumult
of
the
world
and
forgotten
by
those
who
figured
on
its
theatre
it
may
be
that
marguerite
could
and
ought
by
insensible
degrees
to
have
rooted
out
this
disease
of
my
mind
but
i
am
concerned
only
with
the
statement
of
facts
and
i
know
that
no
such
thing
was
the
effect
of
our
intercourse
this
absurd
passion
did
not
however
at
this
time
lead
me
to
any
fatal
extremities
it
contented
itself
with
the
frivolous
gratification
resulting
from
a
certain
portion
of
ostentation
and
expense
i
maintained
a
considerable
train
of
servants
my
apartments
were
magnificent
and
my
furniture
splendid
when
we
travelled
it
was
with
an
attendance
little
short
of
princely
idiot
that
i
was
to
regard
this
as
an
addition
to
the
genuine
pleasures
which
i
have
above
enumerated
when
we
were
at
home
every
accidental
guest
was
received
and
entertained
with
extraordinary
pomp
a
pomp
not
directed
to
add
to
his
accommodation
but
that
was
designed
to
leave
him
impressed
with
astonishment
and
admiration
at
the
spirit
of
his
host
often
indeed
did
i
feel
this
ostentation
an
encumbrance
often
did
i
languish
for
the
ease
and
freedom
which
result
from
a
mediocrity
of
circumstances
but
this
i
called
doing
honour
to
my
ancestors
and
my
country
and
vindicating
the
consideration
due
to
the
house
of
leon
to
quit
this
painful
a
circumstance
which
tended
at
this
time
to
fill
the
measure
of
my
happiness
consisted
in
the
dear
pledges
which
marguerite
bore
me
of
our
mutual
affection
it
is
impossible
for
him
who
has
not
experienced
it
to
conceive
the
accumulation
which
a
genuine
tenderness
derives
from
this
source
the
difficulties
are
many
that
attend
upon
pregnancy
trifles
are
at
that
period
sources
of
fatigue
and
injury
it
is
necessary
that
the
person
should
be
protected
and
the
mind
tranquil
we
love
to
watch
over
a
delicate
plant
that
appears
to
call
for
all
our
anxiety
and
attention
there
is
in
this
case
the
sentiment
without
the
repulsive
circumstances
that
attends
upon
our
sympathy
with
a
dangerous
and
alarming
disease
marguerite
by
her
sensibility
and
growing
attachment
abundantly
rewarded
my
cares
at
length
the
critical
period
arrives
when
an
event
so
extraordinary
occurs
as
can
not
fail
to
put
the
human
frame
in
considerable
jeopardy
never
shall
i
forget
the
interview
between
us
immediately
subsequent
to
her
first
parturition
the
effusion
of
soul
with
which
we
met
each
other
after
all
danger
seemed
to
have
subsided
the
kindness
which
animated
us
increased
as
it
was
by
ideas
of
peril
and
suffering
the
sacred
sensation
with
which
the
mother
presented
her
infant
to
her
husband
or
the
complacency
with
which
we
read
in
each
other
s
eyes
a
common
sentiment
of
melting
tenderness
and
inviolable
attachment
this
she
seemed
to
say
is
the
joint
result
of
our
common
affection
it
partakes
equally
of
both
and
is
the
shrine
in
which
our
sympathies
and
our
life
have
been
poured
together
never
to
be
separated
let
other
lovers
testify
their
engagements
by
presents
and
tokens
we
record
and
stamp
our
attachment
in
this
precious
creature
a
creature
of
that
species
which
is
more
admirable
than
any
thing
else
the
world
has
to
boast
a
creature
susceptible
of
pleasure
and
pain
of
affection
and
love
of
sentiment
and
fancy
of
wisdom
and
virtue
this
creature
will
daily
stand
in
need
of
an
aid
we
shall
delight
to
afford
will
require
our
meditations
and
exertions
to
forward
its
improvement
and
confirm
its
merits
and
its
worth
we
shall
each
blend
our
exertions
for
that
purpose
and
our
union
confirmed
by
this
common
object
of
our
labour
and
affection
will
every
day
become
more
sacred
and
all
this
the
present
weakness
of
my
beloved
marguerite
would
not
allow
her
to
say
but
all
this
occurred
to
my
reflections
and
when
we
had
time
tranquilly
to
compare
our
recollection
of
the
event
it
plainly
appeared
that
in
all
this
our
hearts
and
conceptions
had
most
truly
sympathised
the
possessing
a
third
object
a
common
centre
of
anxiety
to
both
is
far
from
weakening
the
regard
of
such
a
couple
for
each
other
it
does
not
separate
or
divert
them
it
is
a
new
link
of
connection
each
is
attached
to
it
the
more
for
the
sake
of
either
each
regards
it
as
a
sort
of
branch
or
scion
representing
the
parent
each
rejoices
in
its
health
its
good
humour
its
smiles
its
increase
in
size
in
strength
and
in
faculties
principally
from
the
idea
of
the
gratification
they
will
communicate
to
the
other
were
it
not
for
this
idea
were
it
possible
the
pleasure
should
not
be
mutual
the
sentiment
would
be
stripped
of
its
principal
elevation
and
refinement
it
would
be
comparatively
cold
selfish
solitary
and
inane
in
the
first
ten
years
of
our
marriage
my
wife
brought
me
five
children
two
sons
and
three
daughters
the
second
son
only
died
in
his
infancy
my
predominant
passion
at
this
time
was
that
of
domestic
pleasures
and
employments
and
i
devoted
myself
jointly
with
the
mother
to
the
cultivation
of
the
minds
of
my
children
they
all
in
a
considerable
degree
rewarded
our
care
they
were
all
amiable
taught
by
the
example
of
their
parents
they
lived
in
uncommon
harmony
and
affection
charles
the
eldest
was
a
lad
of
a
bold
and
active
disposition
but
the
sentiments
of
virtue
and
honour
that
were
infused
into
him
both
by
marguerite
and
myself
found
a
favourable
reception
and
promised
to
render
those
qualities
which
if
left
to
themselves
might
have
been
turbulent
and
dangerous
productive
of
the
happiest
consequences
julia
his
eldest
sister
was
uncommonly
mild
and
affectionate
alive
to
the
slightest
variations
of
treatment
profoundly
depressed
by
every
mark
of
unkindness
but
exquisitely
sensible
to
demonstrations
of
sympathy
and
attachment
she
appeared
little
formed
to
struggle
with
the
difficulties
of
life
and
the
frowns
of
the
world
but
in
periods
of
quietness
and
tranquillity
nothing
could
exceed
the
sweetness
of
her
character
and
the
fascination
of
her
manners
her
chief
attachment
was
to
her
mother
though
she
was
by
no
means
capable
of
her
mother
s
active
beneficence
and
heroic
fortitude
louisa
the
second
daughter
resembled
her
mother
in
person
and
promised
to
resemble
her
in
character
marguerite
the
youngest
differed
from
the
whole
family
in
the
playfulness
and
frolic
of
her
disposition
her
vivacity
was
inexhaustible
and
was
continually
displaying
itself
in
innocent
tricks
and
smart
unexpected
sallies
nothing
could
possibly
be
more
ingenuous
than
this
admirable
infant
nothing
more
kind
considerate
and
enthusiastic
in
her
tenderness
and
grief
when
an
occasion
occurred
to
call
forth
these
sentiments
but
the
moment
the
sorrowful
occasion
was
over
she
would
resume
all
her
vivacity
and
even
sometimes
in
the
midst
of
her
tears
some
trait
of
her
native
humour
would
escape
i
know
not
whether
all
the
family
were
not
more
attached
to
the
little
marguerite
than
to
any
other
individual
member
as
she
certainly
oftenest
contributed
to
their
amusement
and
such
was
the
amiable
circle
one
and
all
of
whom
have
been
involved
by
me
in
the
most
tremendous
ruin
and
disgrace
chapter
charles
was
now
nine
years
of
age
his
mother
and
myself
had
delighted
ourselves
with
observing
and
forwarding
the
opening
of
his
infant
mind
and
had
hitherto
been
contented
with
the
assistance
of
a
neighbouring
priest
by
way
of
preceptor
but
as
he
was
our
only
son
we
were
desirous
that
he
should
obtain
every
advantage
of
education
we
were
neither
of
us
illiterate
but
in
the
course
of
years
which
had
elapsed
since
i
was
myself
of
charles
s
age
the
progress
of
literature
and
the
literary
passion
in
europe
had
been
astonishingly
great
and
i
was
anxious
that
he
should
realise
in
his
own
person
every
benefit
which
the
fortunate
and
illustrious
period
of
human
affairs
in
which
he
began
to
exist
seemed
to
hold
out
to
him
beside
there
was
an
impetuosity
and
forwardness
in
his
character
that
seemed
ill
to
brook
the
profound
solitude
and
retirement
in
which
his
mother
and
i
were
contented
to
live
his
case
demanded
companions
of
his
own
age
a
little
world
of
with
whom
he
might
engage
in
their
petty
business
and
cares
with
whose
passions
his
own
might
jostle
or
might
sympathise
who
might
kindle
his
emulation
and
open
to
him
the
field
of
fraternal
associations
and
amity
there
was
however
a
considerable
difficulty
attendant
on
this
question
the
schools
of
real
literature
in
france
where
languages
were
properly
taught
and
science
might
be
acquired
were
at
this
time
exceedingly
few
the
nearest
university
was
that
of
toulouse
at
the
distance
of
leagues
this
was
practically
speaking
as
far
from
us
as
paris
itself
was
then
our
darling
child
to
be
torn
from
his
parents
from
all
he
was
accustomed
to
see
and
all
by
whom
he
was
loved
to
be
planted
in
the
midst
of
strangers
to
have
his
mind
excited
to
observation
and
the
spirit
of
generous
contention
roused
at
the
risk
of
suppressing
the
tender
affections
of
his
soul
and
the
sentiments
of
duty
reliance
and
love
there
seemed
however
to
be
no
alternative
it
was
necessary
that
a
temporary
separation
should
take
place
intellectual
improvement
was
a
point
by
all
means
to
be
pursued
and
we
must
direct
our
efforts
to
keep
alive
along
with
it
those
winning
qualities
and
that
softness
of
heart
which
had
hitherto
rendered
charles
so
eminently
our
delight
such
were
our
fond
speculations
and
projects
for
the
future
it
was
at
length
determined
that
i
should
proceed
along
with
him
to
paris
i
could
there
observe
upon
the
spot
the
state
of
the
university
and
the
means
of
learning
that
existed
in
the
metropolis
and
could
consult
with
some
of
those
eminent
luminaries
with
whom
i
had
become
acquainted
at
the
house
of
the
marquis
de
damville
marguerite
declined
accompanying
me
upon
this
occasion
her
father
was
dead
she
could
not
think
of
quitting
her
daughters
for
any
considerable
time
and
our
nuptial
engagement
of
residing
always
in
the
country
gave
her
a
repugnance
to
the
removing
with
her
whole
family
to
paris
it
was
left
probable
that
she
might
come
to
me
when
the
business
was
settled
if
at
that
time
it
was
determined
to
leave
her
son
at
the
capital
and
that
she
might
then
reconduct
me
to
the
place
which
had
been
the
scene
of
all
my
happiness
but
which
i
was
destined
never
to
revisit
in
peace
preliminaries
being
at
length
fully
adjusted
in
the
manner
that
appeared
suitable
to
the
importance
of
the
occasion
i
set
off
for
the
metropolis
of
my
country
which
i
had
seen
only
once
and
that
for
a
very
short
period
in
the
course
of
ten
years
that
visit
had
been
produced
by
a
very
melancholy
circumstance
the
death
of
the
marquis
de
damville
marguerite
and
myself
had
then
been
summoned
and
arrived
at
his
hotel
but
a
few
days
before
he
expired
though
extremely
weakened
by
the
mortal
disease
under
which
he
laboured
he
retained
all
the
faculties
of
his
mind
and
conversed
with
us
in
the
most
affectionate
and
endearing
terms
he
congratulated
us
upon
our
mutual
felicity
nor
could
the
situation
in
which
we
found
him
upon
the
brink
of
an
everlasting
oblivion
of
all
earthly
things
abate
the
sincerity
and
fervour
of
his
delight
he
thanked
me
for
my
carriage
and
conduct
as
a
husband
which
he
said
might
with
propriety
be
held
up
as
a
model
to
the
human
species
he
applauded
himself
for
that
mingled
discernment
and
determination
which
as
he
affirmed
had
so
opportunely
secured
my
virtue
and
his
daughter
s
happiness
he
trusted
that
i
was
now
sufficiently
weaned
from
those
habits
which
had
formerly
given
him
so
much
alarm
at
the
same
time
he
conjured
me
by
every
motive
that
an
overflowing
enthusiasm
could
suggest
to
persist
in
my
good
resolutions
and
never
to
change
that
residence
where
i
had
found
every
degree
of
delight
of
which
the
human
mind
is
in
its
present
condition
susceptible
do
not
said
he
be
drawn
aside
by
ambition
do
not
be
dazzled
by
the
glitter
of
idle
pomp
and
decoration
do
not
enter
the
remotest
circle
of
the
vortex
of
dissipation
live
in
the
midst
of
your
family
cultivate
domestic
affection
be
the
solace
and
joy
of
your
wife
watch
for
the
present
and
future
welfare
of
your
children
and
be
assured
that
you
will
then
be
found
no
contemptible
or
unbeneficial
member
of
the
community
at
large
such
were
the
last
advices
of
the
marquis
de
damville
excellent
man
how
ill
were
your
lessons
remembered
how
ill
your
kindness
remunerated
he
died
in
the
sixth
year
of
our
marriage
the
serious
impression
which
this
event
produced
in
my
mind
gave
me
small
inclination
to
enter
into
any
species
of
society
and
disposed
me
to
quit
paris
as
soon
as
every
respect
had
been
paid
to
the
obsequies
of
the
deceased
upon
my
arrival
in
the
metropolis
on
the
present
occasion
i
immediately
sought
to
renew
my
acquaintance
with
those
amiable
and
eminent
persons
who
had
for
the
most
part
constituted
the
circle
of
the
marquis
de
damville
they
received
me
with
that
interest
and
attention
that
i
have
usually
found
attendant
on
a
cultivated
mind
the
pleasure
was
considerable
that
resulted
from
meeting
them
thus
again
after
ten
years
cessation
of
intercourse
a
few
of
them
indeed
were
dead
and
others
dispersed
by
various
accidents
in
different
parts
of
france
or
of
europe
the
greater
part
however
i
still
found
in
that
celebrated
city
which
might
well
be
considered
as
the
metropolis
of
the
civilised
world
the
king
had
early
been
distinguished
by
his
love
of
letters
and
the
arts
and
added
years
while
they
abated
in
his
mind
the
eagerness
of
ambition
and
glory
gave
new
strength
to
his
more
cultivated
propensities
the
liberality
of
his
conduct
and
the
polished
ease
that
characterised
his
manners
produced
a
general
predilection
in
favour
of
the
capital
in
which
he
resided
i
found
all
my
former
friends
matured
and
improved
by
the
silent
influence
of
time
their
knowledge
was
increased
their
views
rendered
wider
their
conversation
was
more
amusing
and
instructive
their
manners
more
bland
and
unaffected
but
if
their
characters
had
experienced
revolution
mine
was
more
materially
changed
i
had
before
encountered
them
with
all
the
heat
and
presumption
of
youth
with
no
views
so
much
present
to
my
mind
as
those
of
chivalry
and
a
factitious
honour
with
no
experience
but
that
of
a
camp
i
was
impetuous
volatile
and
dissipated
i
had
not
rested
long
enough
upon
any
one
of
the
flowers
of
intellect
to
extract
its
honey
and
my
mind
was
kept
in
a
state
of
preternatural
agitation
by
the
passions
of
a
gamester
it
was
now
become
cool
moderate
and
tranquil
the
society
of
marguerite
had
contributed
much
to
the
improvement
of
my
character
i
had
lived
in
no
idle
and
brutish
solitude
but
in
the
midst
of
contemplation
and
letters
and
i
had
the
passions
of
a
husband
and
a
father
in
the
extremest
degree
attached
to
his
family
these
passions
will
be
found
perhaps
to
be
the
true
school
of
humanity
the
man
whose
situation
continually
exercises
in
him
the
softest
and
most
amiable
charities
of
our
nature
will
almost
infallibly
surpass
his
brethren
in
kindness
to
sympathise
with
and
promptness
to
relieve
the
distresses
of
others
will
it
be
accounted
strange
that
in
paris
surrounded
by
persons
of
various
knowledge
and
liberal
benevolence
i
found
myself
under
the
influence
of
other
feelings
than
any
i
had
lately
experienced
i
was
like
a
man
who
had
suffered
long
calamity
in
a
famished
vessel
or
a
town
besieged
and
is
immediately
after
introduced
into
the
midst
of
luxury
to
a
table
loaded
with
the
most
costly
dainties
every
viand
has
to
his
apprehension
an
exquisite
relish
and
every
wine
a
delicious
flavour
that
he
never
perceived
in
them
before
let
no
one
infer
that
my
love
for
marguerite
was
diminished
it
has
already
sufficiently
appeared
in
the
course
of
my
narrative
that
no
happiness
could
be
more
consummate
than
mine
was
with
this
admirable
woman
had
i
been
called
upon
to
choose
for
the
seat
of
my
future
life
between
my
paternal
château
in
the
bordelois
with
marguerite
to
grace
my
abode
on
the
one
hand
and
all
the
gratifications
that
paris
could
afford
on
the
other
i
should
not
have
hesitated
even
for
an
instant
but
the
mind
of
man
is
made
capacious
of
various
pleasures
and
a
person
of
sound
and
uncorrupted
judgment
will
perhaps
always
enjoy
with
emotion
the
delights
which
for
a
long
time
before
he
had
not
encountered
however
enviable
his
content
may
have
been
under
their
absence
i
delighted
to
converse
with
the
men
of
genius
and
refinement
with
whom
paris
at
this
time
abounded
it
was
a
feast
of
soul
of
which
i
had
rarely
partaken
in
my
rural
retreat
i
delighted
to
combine
excellence
with
number
and
to
a
considerable
degree
at
least
variety
of
intercourse
with
sentiments
of
regard
and
friendship
in
these
select
societies
i
found
no
cold
suppressions
and
reserve
their
members
were
brethren
in
disposition
similar
in
their
pursuits
and
congenial
in
their
sentiments
when
any
one
spoke
it
was
that
the
person
to
whom
he
addressed
himself
might
apprehend
what
was
passing
in
his
thoughts
they
participated
with
sincerity
and
a
liberal
mind
in
each
other
s
feelings
whether
of
gay
delight
or
melancholy
disappointment
thus
situated
i
forgot
for
a
time
my
engagements
with
marguerite
the
scenes
of
leon
its
fields
its
walks
its
woods
and
its
streams
faded
from
my
mind
i
forgot
the
pleasure
with
which
i
had
viewed
my
children
sporting
on
the
green
and
the
delicious
rural
suppers
which
i
had
so
often
partaken
with
my
wife
beneath
my
vines
and
my
at
the
period
of
the
setting
sun
when
i
set
out
for
paris
these
images
had
dwelt
upon
my
mind
and
saddened
my
fancy
at
every
stage
i
felt
myself
removed
still
further
from
the
scene
where
my
treasures
and
my
affections
were
deposited
but
shortly
after
new
scenes
and
new
employments
engaged
my
thoughts
the
pleasures
which
i
sought
but
weakly
at
first
every
time
they
were
tasted
increased
my
partiality
for
them
i
seemed
for
a
time
to
be
under
the
influence
of
an
oblivion
of
my
former
life
thus
circumstanced
the
folly
which
had
so
deep
a
root
in
my
character
took
hold
of
me
i
hired
a
magnificent
hotel
and
entertained
at
my
own
expense
those
persons
in
whose
society
i
principally
delighted
my
circles
became
more
numerous
than
those
of
the
marquis
de
damville
and
were
conducted
in
a
very
different
style
of
splendour
and
profusion
i
corresponded
with
marguerite
but
i
continually
found
some
new
pretext
for
lengthening
my
stay
and
she
on
her
part
though
the
kindest
and
most
indulgent
of
women
became
seriously
alarmed
and
unhappy
as
my
parties
were
more
numerous
than
those
of
the
marquis
de
damville
had
been
they
were
more
mixed
among
others
i
occasionally
associated
with
some
of
those
noblemen
who
had
been
the
companions
of
my
former
dissipation
and
gaming
an
obvious
consequence
resulted
from
this
parties
of
play
were
occasionally
proposed
to
me
i
resisted
i
yielded
my
first
compliances
were
timid
hesitating
and
painful
i
recollected
the
lessons
and
exhortations
of
my
excellent
at
length
however
my
alarms
abated
i
reproached
myself
with
the
want
of
an
honourable
confidence
in
my
own
firmness
and
the
cowardice
of
supposing
that
i
was
not
to
be
trusted
with
the
direction
of
my
conduct
one
evening
i
ventured
beyond
the
cautious
limits
i
had
at
first
prescribed
myself
and
won
a
considerable
sum
this
incident
produced
a
strong
impression
upon
me
and
filled
my
mind
with
tumult
and
agitation
there
was
a
secret
that
i
had
concealed
almost
from
myself
but
which
now
recurred
to
me
with
tenfold
violence
i
was
living
beyond
the
means
i
had
to
discharge
my
expenses
my
propensity
of
this
sort
seemed
to
be
fatal
and
irresistible
my
marriage
with
marguerite
had
occurred
opportunely
to
heal
the
breaches
i
had
at
that
time
made
in
my
fortune
and
to
take
from
me
the
consciousness
of
embarrassments
which
i
should
otherwise
have
deeply
felt
the
death
of
the
marquis
however
deplorable
in
other
respects
happened
at
a
period
when
the
spirit
of
profusion
and
magnificence
which
characterised
me
had
again
involved
my
affairs
in
considerable
difficulty
it
might
be
supposed
that
these
two
cases
of
experience
would
have
sufficed
to
extirpate
my
folly
but
they
had
rather
the
contrary
effect
in
each
of
them
the
event
was
such
as
to
prevent
extravagance
and
thoughtlessness
from
producing
their
genuine
results
and
of
consequence
they
appeared
less
criminal
and
mischievous
in
my
eyes
than
otherwise
they
probably
would
have
appeared
i
rather
increased
than
diminished
my
establishment
upon
the
death
of
my
i
had
no
reasonable
prospect
of
any
property
hereafter
to
descend
to
me
that
should
exonerate
me
from
the
consequences
of
further
prodigality
but
i
did
not
advert
to
this
i
saw
myself
surrounded
by
my
children
they
were
the
delight
and
solace
of
my
life
and
yet
i
was
needless
of
their
interests
sometimes
i
resolved
upon
a
more
rigid
economy
but
economy
is
a
principle
that
does
not
easily
lay
hold
of
any
but
a
heart
framed
to
receive
it
it
is
a
business
of
attentive
and
vigilant
detail
it
easily
escapes
the
mind
amidst
the
impetuosity
of
the
passions
the
obstinacy
of
rooted
propensities
and
the
seduction
of
long
established
habits
marguerite
indeed
did
not
share
with
me
in
these
follies
the
simplicity
and
ingenuousness
of
her
mind
were
such
that
she
would
have
been
as
happy
in
a
cottage
as
a
palace
but
though
she
did
not
partake
my
vices
an
forbearance
and
tenderness
for
my
feelings
did
not
permit
her
effectually
to
counteract
them
this
is
perhaps
the
only
defect
of
character
i
am
able
to
impute
to
her
after
i
had
won
the
sum
to
which
i
have
alluded
i
retired
to
my
hotel
full
of
anxious
thoughts
it
produced
upon
me
in
some
degree
the
same
effect
as
ordinarily
belongs
to
a
great
calamity
i
lay
all
night
sleepless
and
disturbed
ruin
and
despair
presented
themselves
to
my
mind
in
a
thousand
forms
heedless
prodigality
and
dilapidated
revenues
passed
in
review
before
me
i
counted
the
years
of
my
life
i
had
completed
the
year
of
my
age
this
was
scarcely
half
the
probable
duration
of
human
existence
how
was
i
to
support
the
remaining
period
a
period
little
assorted
to
difficulties
and
expedients
and
which
in
the
close
of
it
seems
imperiously
to
call
for
every
indulgence
hitherto
an
interval
of
four
or
five
years
had
repeatedly
sufficed
to
involve
me
in
serious
embarrassment
my
children
were
growing
up
around
me
my
family
was
likely
to
become
still
larger
as
my
offspring
increased
in
years
their
demands
upon
my
revenues
would
be
more
considerable
were
these
demands
to
be
slighted
were
my
daughters
nay
was
the
heir
of
my
rank
and
my
name
to
be
committed
to
the
compassion
of
the
world
unprovided
and
forlorn
what
a
cheerless
prospect
what
a
gloomy
and
disconsolate
hue
did
these
ideas
spread
upon
that
future
which
the
health
of
the
human
mind
requires
to
have
gilded
with
the
beams
of
hope
and
expectation
i
had
already
tried
the
expedient
of
economy
and
i
had
uniformly
found
this
inestimable
and
only
of
prudence
gliding
from
my
deluded
grasp
could
i
promise
myself
better
success
in
future
there
seemed
to
be
something
in
my
habits
whether
of
inattention
ostentation
or
inconsistency
that
baffled
the
strongest
motives
by
which
parsimony
and
frugality
can
be
enforced
why
did
these
thoughts
importunately
recur
to
me
in
the
present
moment
they
were
the
suggestions
of
a
malignant
genius
thoughts
the
destination
of
which
was
to
lead
me
into
a
gulf
of
misery
and
guilt
while
i
was
going
on
in
a
regular
train
of
expense
while
i
was
scooping
the
mine
that
was
to
swallow
me
and
my
hopes
together
i
had
the
art
to
keep
these
reflections
at
bay
now
that
i
had
met
with
an
unexpected
piece
of
good
fortune
they
rushed
upon
me
with
irresistible
violence
unfortunate
coincidence
miserable
rather
let
me
say
guilty
abandoned
miscreant
as
soon
as
i
rose
in
the
morning
i
went
to
the
closet
where
the
evening
before
i
had
deposited
my
recent
acquisitions
i
spread
out
the
gold
before
me
i
gazed
upon
it
with
intentness
my
eyes
a
moment
after
rolled
in
vacancy
i
traversed
the
apartment
with
impatient
steps
all
the
demon
seemed
to
make
his
descent
upon
my
soul
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
ever
felt
the
struggle
of
conscious
guilt
and
dishonour
i
was
far
indeed
from
anticipating
that
species
of
guilt
and
that
species
of
ruin
which
soon
after
overwhelmed
me
my
mind
did
not
once
recur
to
the
possibility
of
any
serious
mischief
i
dwelt
only
as
gamesters
perhaps
usually
do
upon
the
alternative
between
acquisition
and
no
acquisition
i
did
not
take
into
the
account
the
ungovernableness
of
my
own
passions
i
assumed
it
as
unquestionable
that
i
could
stop
when
i
pleased
the
thoughts
that
tortured
me
were
in
the
first
place
those
of
a
sanguine
and
unexperienced
adventurer
in
a
lottery
whose
mind
rests
not
for
a
moment
upon
the
sum
he
has
risked
but
who
having
in
fancy
the
principal
prize
already
in
his
possession
and
having
distributed
it
to
various
objects
and
purposes
sometimes
fearfully
recurs
to
the
possibility
of
his
disappointment
and
anticipates
with
terror
what
will
be
his
situation
if
deprived
of
this
imaginary
wealth
i
had
now
for
the
first
time
opened
my
eyes
to
the
real
state
of
my
affairs
and
i
clung
with
proportionable
vehemence
to
this
plank
which
was
to
bear
me
from
the
storm
in
the
second
place
i
felt
though
darkly
and
unwillingly
the
immorality
of
my
conception
to
game
may
in
some
instances
not
be
in
diametrical
opposition
to
liberality
of
mind
but
he
who
games
for
the
express
purpose
of
improving
his
circumstances
must
be
an
idiot
if
he
does
not
sometimes
recollect
that
the
money
lost
may
be
as
serious
a
mischief
to
his
neighbour
as
the
money
gained
can
possibly
be
a
benefit
to
himself
it
is
past
a
question
that
he
who
thus
turns
his
amusement
into
his
business
loses
the
dignity
of
a
man
of
honour
and
puts
himself
upon
a
level
with
the
most
avaricious
and
usurious
merchant
though
i
was
far
from
having
digested
a
specific
plan
of
enriching
myself
by
these
discreditable
means
yet
the
very
tumult
of
my
thoughts
operated
strongly
to
lead
me
once
more
to
the
i
was
in
no
humour
to
busy
myself
with
my
own
thoughts
the
calmness
of
literary
discussion
and
the
polished
interchange
of
wit
which
had
lately
so
much
delighted
me
had
now
no
attraction
for
my
heart
the
turbulence
of
a
scene
of
high
play
alone
had
power
to
distract
my
attention
from
the
storm
within
i
won
a
second
time
i
felt
the
rapidity
and
intenseness
of
my
contemplations
still
further
accelerated
i
will
not
over
again
detail
what
they
were
suffice
it
to
say
that
my
hopes
became
more
ardent
my
conception
of
the
necessity
of
this
resource
more
impressive
and
my
alarm
lest
this
last
expedient
should
fail
me
more
tormenting
the
next
time
i
lost
half
as
much
as
the
sum
of
my
winnings
i
then
proceeded
for
several
days
in
a
nearly
regular
alternation
of
gain
and
loss
this
as
soon
as
the
fact
unavoidably
forced
itself
upon
my
mind
only
served
to
render
my
thoughts
more
desperate
no
exclaimed
i
it
was
not
for
this
that
i
entered
upon
so
tormenting
a
pursuit
it
is
not
for
this
that
i
have
deserted
the
learned
societies
which
were
lately
my
delight
and
committed
myself
to
a
sea
of
disquiet
and
anxiety
i
came
not
here
like
a
boy
for
amusement
or
like
one
who
has
been
bred
in
the
lap
of
ignorance
and
wealth
to
seek
a
relief
from
the
burden
of
existence
and
to
find
a
stimulus
to
animate
my
torpid
spirits
am
i
then
to
be
for
ever
baffled
am
i
to
cultivate
a
tract
of
land
which
is
to
present
me
nothing
in
return
but
unvaried
barenness
am
i
continually
to
wind
up
my
passions
and
my
attention
in
vain
am
i
a
mere
instrument
to
be
played
upon
by
endless
hopes
and
fears
and
tormenting
wishes
am
i
to
be
the
sport
of
events
the
fool
of
promise
always
agitated
with
near
approaching
good
yet
always
deluded
this
frame
of
mind
led
me
on
insensibly
to
the
most
extravagant
adventures
it
threw
me
in
the
first
place
into
the
hands
of
notorious
gamblers
men
of
real
property
shrunk
from
the
stakes
i
proposed
as
though
they
were
in
some
degree
infected
with
the
venom
of
gaming
their
infection
was
not
so
deep
as
mine
nor
with
my
desperation
of
thought
the
players
with
whom
i
engaged
were
for
the
most
part
well
known
to
every
one
but
myself
not
to
be
able
to
pay
the
sums
they
played
for
if
they
lost
nay
this
fact
might
be
said
in
some
sense
to
be
known
to
me
as
well
as
the
rest
though
i
obstinately
steeled
myself
against
the
recollection
of
it
one
evening
i
won
of
one
of
these
persons
a
very
large
sum
for
which
i
suffered
him
to
play
with
me
upon
honour
the
consequence
was
simple
the
next
morning
he
took
his
departure
from
paris
and
i
heard
of
him
no
more
before
this
however
the
tide
of
success
had
set
strongly
against
me
i
had
sustained
some
serious
vicissitudes
and
while
i
was
playing
with
the
wretch
i
have
just
mentioned
my
eagerness
increased
as
my
good
luck
began
and
i
flattered
myself
that
i
should
now
avenge
myself
of
fortune
for
some
of
her
late
unkindnesses
my
anguish
why
should
i
call
the
thing
by
a
disproportionate
and
trivial
appellation
my
agony
was
by
so
much
the
greater
when
i
found
that
this
person
the
very
individual
who
had
already
stripped
me
of
considerable
sums
had
disappeared
and
left
me
without
the
smallest
benefit
from
my
imaginary
winnings
no
man
who
has
not
felt
can
possibly
image
to
himself
the
tortures
of
a
gamester
of
a
gamester
like
me
who
played
for
the
improvement
of
his
fortune
who
played
with
the
recollection
of
a
wife
and
children
dearer
to
him
than
the
blood
that
bubbled
through
the
arteries
of
his
heart
who
might
be
said
like
the
savages
of
ancient
germany
to
make
these
relations
the
stake
for
which
he
threw
who
saw
all
my
own
happiness
and
all
theirs
through
the
long
vista
of
life
depending
on
the
turn
of
a
card
hell
is
but
the
chimera
of
priests
to
bubble
idiots
and
cowards
what
have
they
invented
to
come
into
competition
with
what
i
felt
their
alternate
interchange
of
flames
and
ice
is
but
a
feeble
image
of
the
eternal
varieties
of
hope
and
fear
all
bodily
racks
and
torments
are
nothing
compared
with
certain
states
of
the
human
mind
the
gamester
would
be
the
most
pitiable
if
he
were
not
the
most
despicable
creature
that
exists
arrange
ten
bits
of
painted
paper
in
a
certain
order
and
he
is
ready
to
go
wild
with
the
extravagance
of
his
joy
he
is
only
restrained
by
some
remains
of
shame
from
dancing
about
the
room
and
displaying
the
vileness
of
his
spirit
by
every
sort
of
freak
and
absurdity
at
another
time
when
his
hopes
have
been
gradually
worked
up
into
a
paroxysm
an
unexpected
turn
arrives
and
he
is
made
the
most
miserable
of
men
never
shall
i
cease
to
recollect
the
sensation
i
have
repeatedly
felt
in
the
instantaneous
sinking
of
the
spirits
the
conscious
fire
that
spread
over
my
visage
the
anger
in
my
eye
the
burning
dryness
of
my
throat
the
sentiment
that
in
a
moment
was
ready
to
overwhelm
with
curses
the
cards
the
stake
my
own
existence
and
all
mankind
how
every
malignant
and
insufferable
passion
seemed
to
rush
upon
my
soul
what
nights
of
dreadful
solitude
and
despair
did
i
repeatedly
pass
during
the
progress
of
my
ruin
it
was
the
night
of
the
soul
my
mind
was
wrapped
in
a
gloom
that
could
not
be
pierced
my
heart
was
oppressed
with
a
weight
that
no
power
human
or
divine
was
equal
to
remove
my
eyelids
seemed
to
press
downward
with
an
invincible
burden
my
eyeballs
were
ready
to
start
and
crack
their
sockets
i
lay
motionless
the
victim
of
ineffable
horror
the
whole
endless
night
seemed
to
be
filled
with
one
vast
appalling
immovable
idea
it
was
a
stupor
more
insupportable
and
tremendous
than
the
utmost
whirl
of
pain
or
the
fiercest
agony
of
exquisite
perception
one
day
that
my
mind
was
in
a
state
of
excessive
anguish
and
remorse
i
had
already
contrived
by
this
infernal
means
to
dispossess
myself
of
the
half
of
my
property
my
son
came
unexpectedly
into
my
chamber
for
some
time
i
had
scarcely
ever
seen
him
such
is
a
gamester
all
the
night
while
he
slept
i
was
engaged
in
these
haunts
of
demons
all
the
day
while
he
was
awake
and
studying
with
his
masters
or
amusing
himself
i
was
in
my
endeavouring
to
court
a
few
broken
hours
of
sleep
when
notwithstanding
the
opposition
of
our
habits
i
had
the
opportunity
of
seeing
him
i
rather
shunned
to
use
than
sought
to
embrace
it
the
sight
of
him
had
a
savour
of
bitterness
in
it
that
more
than
balanced
all
the
solace
of
natural
affection
it
brought
before
me
the
image
of
his
mother
and
his
sisters
it
presented
to
my
soul
a
frightful
tale
of
deserted
duties
it
was
more
galling
and
envenomed
than
the
sting
of
scorpions
starting
at
the
sound
of
the
opening
door
i
called
out
abruptly
and
with
some
harshness
who
is
there
what
do
you
want
it
is
i
sir
replied
the
boy
it
is
charles
come
to
pay
his
duty
to
you
i
do
not
want
you
now
you
should
not
come
but
when
you
know
i
am
at
leisure
answered
i
somewhat
disturbed
very
well
sir
very
well
i
am
as
he
spoke
his
voice
seemed
suffocated
with
tears
he
was
on
the
point
of
shutting
the
door
and
leaving
me
to
myself
charles
said
i
not
well
knowing
what
it
was
i
intended
to
do
he
returned
come
here
my
dear
boy
i
took
his
hand
i
drew
him
between
my
knees
i
hid
my
face
in
his
neck
i
shook
with
the
violence
of
my
emotion
go
go
boy
you
perceive
i
can
not
talk
to
i
pushed
him
gently
from
me
papa
cried
he
i
do
not
like
to
leave
you
i
know
i
am
but
a
boy
and
can
be
but
of
little
use
to
you
if
mamma
were
with
you
i
would
not
be
troublesome
i
should
cry
when
i
saw
you
were
grieved
but
i
would
ask
no
questions
and
would
leave
you
because
you
desired
it
i
hope
you
have
not
had
any
bad
news
no
my
boy
no
come
to
me
and
i
will
be
at
leisure
and
will
talk
a
great
deal
to
ah
papa
every
day
that
i
did
not
see
you
i
thought
it
would
be
and
there
was
one
and
another
and
so
many
that
it
seemed
as
if
you
had
forgotten
to
speak
to
me
at
why
charles
you
do
not
doubt
my
word
i
tell
you
that
you
shall
see
me
as
long
as
you
well
well
i
will
wait
but
do
then
let
it
be
all
day
i
will
not
go
to
college
and
it
shall
be
a
holiday
papa
i
do
not
like
my
lessons
half
so
well
as
i
did
since
i
have
neither
you
nor
mamma
that
i
can
tell
what
they
are
charles
be
a
good
boy
remember
papa
now
i
am
sure
you
look
a
good
deal
better
than
you
did
at
first
let
me
tell
you
something
about
the
lesson
i
read
this
morning
it
was
a
story
of
zaleucus
the
locrian
who
put
out
one
of
his
own
eyes
that
he
might
preserve
to
his
this
artless
story
thus
innocently
introduced
cut
me
to
the
soul
i
started
in
my
chair
and
hid
my
face
upon
the
table
papa
what
is
the
matter
indeed
you
frighten
me
zaleucus
was
a
father
what
then
am
i
yes
zaleucus
was
very
good
indeed
but
do
you
know
his
son
was
very
naughty
it
was
his
disobedience
and
wickedness
that
made
him
liable
to
such
a
punishment
i
would
not
for
the
world
be
like
zaleucus
s
son
i
hope
papa
you
will
never
suffer
from
my
wilfulness
you
shall
not
papa
indeed
indeed
i
caught
the
boy
in
my
arms
no
you
are
very
good
you
are
too
good
i
can
not
bear
it
well
papa
i
wish
i
were
able
to
show
you
that
i
love
you
as
well
as
ever
zaleucus
loved
his
son
i
was
melted
with
the
ingenuousness
of
the
boy
s
expression
i
quitted
him
i
paced
up
and
down
the
room
suddenly
as
if
by
paroxysm
of
insanity
i
seized
my
child
by
the
arm
i
seated
myself
i
drew
him
towards
me
i
put
my
eye
upon
him
boy
how
dare
you
talk
to
me
of
zaleucus
do
you
mean
to
insinuate
a
reproach
do
i
not
discharge
a
father
s
duty
if
i
do
not
know
urchin
i
will
not
be
insulted
by
my
child
the
boy
was
astonished
he
burst
into
tears
and
was
silent
i
was
moved
by
his
evident
distress
no
child
you
have
no
father
i
am
afraid
you
have
not
you
do
not
know
my
baseness
you
do
not
know
that
i
am
the
deadliest
foe
you
have
in
the
dear
papa
do
not
talk
thus
do
not
i
know
that
you
are
the
best
of
men
do
not
i
love
you
and
mamma
better
than
every
body
else
put
together
well
charles
cried
i
endeavouring
to
compose
myself
we
will
talk
no
more
now
did
not
i
tell
you
you
should
not
come
to
me
but
when
you
knew
it
was
a
proper
time
i
hope
you
will
never
have
reason
to
hate
i
never
will
hate
you
papa
do
to
me
what
you
will
he
saw
i
wished
to
be
alone
and
left
me
chapter
vi
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
my
beloved
marguerite
arrived
unexpectedly
at
paris
in
the
beginning
of
our
separation
i
had
been
to
the
last
degree
punctual
in
my
letters
i
had
no
pleasure
so
great
as
retiring
to
my
closet
and
pouring
out
my
soul
to
the
most
adorable
of
women
by
degrees
i
relaxed
in
punctuality
ordinary
occupations
however
closely
pursued
have
a
method
in
them
that
easily
combines
with
regularity
in
points
of
an
incidental
nature
but
gaming
when
pursued
with
avidity
subverts
all
order
and
forces
every
avocation
from
the
place
assigned
it
when
my
insane
project
of
supplying
the
inadequateness
of
my
fortune
by
this
expedient
began
to
produce
an
effect
exactly
opposite
i
could
not
but
with
the
extremest
difficulty
string
my
mind
to
write
to
the
mistress
of
my
soul
i
endeavoured
not
to
think
with
distinctness
and
attention
of
the
persons
whose
happiness
was
most
nearly
involved
with
mine
i
said
to
myself
yet
another
venture
must
be
tried
fortune
shall
change
the
animosity
with
which
she
has
lately
pursued
me
i
will
repair
the
breaches
that
have
been
sustained
and
i
shall
then
return
with
tenfold
avidity
to
subjects
that
at
present
i
dare
not
fix
my
mind
upon
my
letters
were
accordingly
short
unfrequent
and
unsatisfactory
and
those
of
marguerite
discovered
increasing
anguish
perturbation
and
anxiety
what
a
change
in
the
minds
of
both
had
the
lapse
of
a
few
months
produced
not
that
my
attachment
had
suffered
the
diminution
of
a
single
particle
but
that
attachment
which
had
lately
been
the
source
of
our
mutual
felicity
was
now
fraught
only
with
distress
my
mind
was
filled
with
horrors
and
marguerite
expected
from
me
an
encouragement
and
consolation
in
absence
which
alas
i
had
it
not
in
my
power
to
give
i
had
now
continued
in
paris
for
a
time
vastly
greater
than
i
had
originally
proposed
after
having
remained
more
than
ten
days
without
receiving
one
word
of
intelligence
a
letter
of
mine
was
delivered
to
marguerite
more
short
mysterious
and
distressing
to
her
feelings
than
any
that
had
preceded
the
ten
days
silence
from
me
who
at
first
had
never
missed
an
opportunity
of
pouring
out
my
soul
to
her
and
contributing
to
her
pleasure
was
exquisitely
painful
there
is
scarcely
any
thing
that
produces
such
a
sickness
of
the
heart
as
the
repeated
prorogation
of
hope
but
when
the
letter
arrived
that
had
been
so
anxiously
looked
for
when
the
of
the
superscription
was
recognised
when
the
letter
was
treasured
up
for
the
impatiently
desired
moment
of
solitude
that
the
sacred
emotions
of
the
heart
might
suffer
no
interruption
and
when
it
at
last
appeared
so
cold
so
ominous
so
withering
to
the
buds
of
affection
the
determination
of
marguerite
was
speedily
formed
the
relations
that
bound
us
together
were
of
too
mighty
a
value
to
be
dispensed
or
to
be
trifled
with
she
felt
them
as
the
very
cords
of
existence
for
ten
years
she
had
known
no
solace
that
was
disconnected
from
my
idea
no
care
but
of
our
own
happiness
and
that
of
our
offspring
benevolent
she
was
almost
beyond
human
example
and
interested
for
the
welfare
of
all
she
knew
but
these
were
brief
and
mutable
concerns
they
were
not
incorporated
with
the
stamina
of
her
existence
i
was
the
whole
world
to
her
she
had
no
idea
of
satisfaction
without
me
her
firmness
had
been
sufficiently
tried
by
the
interposal
of
separation
and
absence
how
was
she
to
interpret
the
obscurity
that
had
now
arisen
had
i
forgotten
my
family
and
my
wife
had
i
been
corrupted
and
debauched
by
that
paris
the
effects
of
which
upon
my
character
her
father
had
so
deeply
apprehended
had
i
in
contempt
of
every
thing
sacred
entered
into
some
new
attachment
had
the
attractions
of
some
new
beauty
in
the
metropolis
made
me
indifferent
to
the
virtue
of
my
children
and
the
life
of
their
mother
perhaps
the
length
of
our
attachment
had
infected
me
with
satiety
and
the
inconstancy
of
my
temper
had
been
roused
by
the
charms
of
novelty
perhaps
the
certainty
of
her
kindness
and
regard
had
no
longer
allurements
for
me
and
i
might
be
excited
to
the
pursuit
of
another
by
the
pleasures
of
hope
combined
with
uncertainty
and
of
a
coyness
that
seemed
to
promise
compliance
hereafter
even
while
it
pronounced
a
present
denial
these
were
the
images
that
haunted
her
mind
they
engendered
all
the
wildness
and
all
the
torments
of
a
delirious
paroxysm
she
resolved
that
no
time
should
be
sacrificed
to
needless
uncertainty
and
that
no
effort
of
hers
should
be
unexerted
to
prevent
the
mischief
she
feared
it
was
evening
when
she
arrived
i
was
upon
the
point
of
repairing
to
that
scene
of
nightly
resort
the
source
of
all
my
guilt
and
all
my
miseries
i
enquired
of
my
son
s
valet
where
he
was
and
how
he
had
been
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
was
gone
to
bed
he
had
appeared
unusually
sad
sometimes
in
tears
and
while
he
was
undressing
had
sighed
deeply
two
or
three
times
while
i
was
collecting
this
account
in
my
own
apartment
the
gates
of
the
hotel
opened
and
a
number
of
horsemen
entered
the
i
was
somewhat
surprised
because
though
i
was
accustomed
to
see
much
company
few
of
my
acquaintance
visited
me
at
so
late
an
hour
except
on
the
evenings
appropriated
to
receive
them
i
crossed
the
saloon
to
enquire
one
of
the
servants
exclaimed
it
is
bernardin
s
voice
it
must
be
my
mistress
that
is
come
nothing
could
be
further
from
my
mind
than
the
thought
of
her
arrival
i
flew
through
the
passage
i
was
on
the
spot
the
moment
that
the
servant
prepared
to
conduct
his
mistress
from
the
litter
i
received
marguerite
in
my
arms
and
led
her
into
the
house
if
i
had
expected
her
arrival
i
should
infallibly
have
met
her
at
this
moment
with
anxiety
and
confusion
i
should
have
gone
round
the
circle
of
my
thoughts
and
should
not
have
had
confidence
to
encounter
the
beam
of
her
eye
but
the
event
was
so
unexpected
as
to
drive
all
other
ideas
from
my
mind
and
in
consequence
i
enjoyed
several
minutes
ages
rather
let
me
say
of
the
sincerest
transport
i
kissed
the
mistress
of
my
soul
with
ecstasy
i
gazed
upon
her
well
known
lineaments
and
features
i
listened
to
the
pleasing
melody
of
her
voice
i
was
intoxicated
with
delight
upon
occasions
like
this
it
seems
as
if
every
former
joy
that
had
marked
the
various
periods
of
intercourse
distilled
its
very
spirit
and
essence
to
compose
a
draught
ten
times
more
delicious
and
refined
than
had
ever
before
been
tasted
our
meeting
was
like
awaking
from
the
dead
it
was
the
emancipation
of
the
weary
captive
who
exchanges
the
dungeon
s
gloom
for
the
lustre
of
the
morning
and
who
feels
a
celestial
exhilaration
of
heart
the
very
memory
of
which
had
been
insensibly
wearing
away
from
his
treacherous
brain
all
my
senses
partook
of
the
rapture
marguerite
seemed
to
shed
ambrosial
odours
round
her
her
touch
was
thrilling
her
lips
were
nectar
her
figure
was
that
of
a
descended
deity
her
pleasure
was
not
less
than
mine
it
is
indeed
absurd
it
may
be
termed
profanation
to
talk
of
solitary
pleasure
no
sensation
ordinarily
distinguished
by
that
epithet
can
endure
the
test
of
a
moment
s
inspection
when
compared
with
a
social
enjoyment
it
is
then
only
that
a
man
is
truly
pleased
when
pulse
replies
to
pulse
when
the
eyes
discourse
eloquently
to
each
other
when
in
responsive
tones
and
words
the
soul
is
communicated
altogether
we
are
conscious
of
a
sober
a
chaste
and
dignified
intoxication
an
elevation
of
spirit
that
does
not
bereave
the
mind
of
itself
and
that
endures
long
enough
for
us
to
analyse
and
savour
the
causes
of
our
joy
for
some
time
we
rested
on
a
sofa
each
filled
and
occupied
with
the
observation
of
the
other
my
eyes
assured
marguerite
of
the
constancy
of
my
affection
my
kisses
were
those
of
chaste
undivided
entire
attachment
our
words
were
insignificant
and
idle
the
broken
and
incoherent
phrases
of
a
happiness
that
could
not
be
silent
at
length
marguerite
exclaimed
it
is
enough
my
fears
are
vanished
i
have
no
questions
to
ask
no
doubts
to
remove
yet
why
my
reginald
did
you
suffer
those
doubts
to
gather
those
fears
to
accumulate
surely
you
knew
the
singleness
of
my
affection
how
many
painful
days
and
hours
might
you
have
saved
me
almost
by
a
word
forgive
me
my
love
replied
i
waste
not
the
golden
hour
of
meeting
in
recrimination
feeling
as
your
angelic
goodness
now
makes
me
feel
i
wonder
at
myself
that
i
could
for
one
moment
have
consented
to
separation
that
i
could
have
thought
any
thing
but
this
existence
or
that
having
experienced
the
joys
that
you
have
bestowed
i
could
lose
all
image
of
the
past
and
dwelling
in
a
desert
imagine
it
paradise
recrimination
rejoined
marguerite
no
my
love
you
make
me
too
happy
to
leave
room
for
any
thing
but
gratitude
and
affection
forgive
me
reginald
if
i
pretend
that
in
meeting
you
thus
i
find
myself
your
superior
in
happiness
and
love
you
only
awake
from
lethargy
forgetfulness
of
yourself
and
of
me
but
i
awake
from
anguish
a
separation
that
i
desired
not
at
first
and
of
which
i
hourly
wished
to
see
an
end
from
doubts
that
would
intrude
and
refused
to
be
expelled
from
the
incessant
contemplation
and
regret
of
a
felicity
once
possessed
but
possessed
no
longer
melancholy
ideas
gloomy
prognostics
overspread
my
sleepless
nights
and
bedewed
my
pillow
with
tears
this
it
is
that
at
last
has
driven
me
from
my
family
and
daughters
resolved
to
obtain
the
certainty
of
despair
or
the
dispersion
of
my
fears
have
i
known
all
this
and
think
you
that
i
do
not
enjoy
with
rapture
this
blissful
moment
while
we
were
thus
conversing
charles
entered
the
room
he
was
not
yet
asleep
when
his
mother
arrived
he
heard
her
voice
and
hastened
to
put
on
his
clothes
that
he
might
rush
into
her
arms
the
pleasure
marguerite
had
conceived
from
our
meeting
and
the
affectionate
serenity
that
had
taken
possession
of
her
soul
infused
double
ardour
into
the
embraces
she
bestowed
on
her
son
he
gazed
earnestly
in
her
face
he
kissed
her
with
fervency
but
was
silent
why
charles
said
she
what
is
the
matter
with
you
are
not
you
glad
to
see
me
that
i
am
mamma
so
glad
that
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
myself
i
was
afraid
i
never
should
have
been
glad
again
pooh
boy
what
do
you
mean
you
were
not
were
you
yes
indeed
i
was
sick
sick
at
heart
not
that
i
am
a
coward
i
think
that
i
could
have
been
satisfied
to
have
been
without
either
my
father
or
you
for
a
little
while
but
papa
is
so
altered
you
can
not
think
he
never
smiles
and
looks
happy
and
when
i
see
him
instead
of
making
me
joyful
as
it
used
to
do
it
makes
me
sad
dear
reginald
replied
the
mother
looking
at
me
is
it
possible
that
while
my
heart
was
haunted
with
fear
and
suspicions
separation
alone
should
have
had
such
an
effect
on
you
i
dare
say
it
was
that
interposed
the
boy
i
could
not
make
papa
smile
all
i
could
do
but
now
you
are
come
he
will
soon
be
well
how
much
he
must
love
you
mamma
the
artless
prattle
of
my
son
struck
anguish
to
my
soul
and
awakened
a
whole
train
of
tormenting
thoughts
alas
thought
i
can
it
indeed
be
love
that
thus
contrives
against
the
peace
of
its
object
would
to
god
my
child
that
my
thoughts
were
as
simple
and
pure
as
thy
innocent
bosom
and
yet
added
the
boy
as
if
recollecting
himself
if
he
could
not
see
you
sure
that
was
no
reason
for
him
to
avoid
me
he
seemed
as
much
afraid
of
me
as
i
have
seen
some
of
my
of
a
snake
indeed
mamma
it
was
a
sad
thing
that
when
i
wanted
him
to
kiss
me
and
press
me
to
his
bosom
he
shrunk
away
from
me
there
now
it
was
just
so
as
he
looks
now
that
papa
used
to
frown
upon
me
i
can
not
tell
how
often
now
is
not
that
ugly
mamma
i
could
no
longer
govern
the
tumult
of
my
thoughts
peace
urchin
cried
i
why
did
you
come
to
mar
the
transport
of
our
meeting
just
now
marguerite
i
forgot
myself
and
was
happy
now
all
the
villain
rises
in
my
soul
my
wife
was
so
astonished
at
the
perturbation
of
my
manner
and
at
the
words
i
uttered
that
she
was
scarcely
able
to
articulate
reginald
in
broken
accents
she
exclaimed
my
love
my
husband
no
matter
said
i
it
shall
yet
be
well
my
heart
assures
me
it
shall
be
not
disturbed
my
love
i
will
never
cause
you
a
moment
s
anguish
i
would
sooner
die
a
thousand
deaths
forget
the
odious
thoughts
that
poor
charles
has
excited
in
me
so
unseasonably
they
were
mere
idle
words
depend
upon
it
they
were
while
i
was
speaking
marguerite
hid
her
face
upon
the
sofa
i
took
her
hand
and
by
my
caresses
endeavoured
to
soothe
and
compose
her
at
length
turning
to
me
reginald
said
she
in
a
voice
of
anguish
do
you
then
endeavour
to
hide
from
me
the
real
state
of
your
thoughts
was
the
joy
that
attended
our
meeting
perishable
and
deceitful
after
ten
years
of
unbounded
affection
and
confidence
am
i
denied
to
be
the
partner
of
your
bosom
no
marguerite
no
this
was
but
the
thought
of
a
moment
by
s
dawn
it
shall
have
no
existence
in
my
bosom
why
should
i
torment
you
with
what
so
soon
shall
have
no
existence
to
myself
meanwhile
be
assured
my
love
instead
of
suffering
diminution
is
more
full
more
fervent
and
entire
than
it
ever
was
at
this
instant
my
mind
experienced
an
extraordinary
impression
instead
of
being
weaned
by
the
presence
of
this
admirable
woman
from
my
passion
for
gaming
it
became
stronger
than
ever
if
charles
had
not
entered
at
the
critical
moment
he
did
i
should
have
remained
with
marguerite
and
amidst
the
so
long
untasted
solace
of
love
have
at
least
for
this
night
forgotten
my
cares
but
that
occurrence
had
overturned
every
thing
had
uncovered
the
wounds
of
my
bosom
and
awakened
conceptions
that
refused
to
be
laid
to
sleep
again
the
arms
of
my
wife
that
were
about
to
embrace
me
suddenly
became
to
me
a
nest
of
scorpions
i
could
as
soon
have
rested
and
enjoyed
myself
upon
the
top
of
vesuvius
when
it
flamed
new
as
i
was
to
this
species
of
anguish
tranquilly
and
full
of
virtuous
contentment
as
i
had
hitherto
passed
the
years
of
my
married
state
the
pangs
of
a
guilty
conscience
i
was
wholly
unable
to
bear
i
rose
from
my
seat
and
was
upon
the
point
of
quitting
the
room
marguerite
perceived
by
my
manner
that
there
was
something
extraordinary
passing
in
my
mind
where
are
you
going
reginald
said
she
i
answered
with
a
slight
nod
not
far
i
replied
attempting
an
air
of
apathy
and
unconcern
she
was
not
satisfied
you
are
not
going
out
she
enquired
i
returned
to
where
i
had
been
sitting
my
love
i
was
going
out
at
the
moment
of
your
arrival
it
is
necessary
i
assure
you
i
hope
i
shall
soon
be
back
i
am
sorry
i
am
obliged
to
leave
you
compose
yourself
you
are
in
want
of
rest
and
had
better
go
to
stop
reginald
afford
me
a
minute
s
leisure
before
you
depart
leave
us
charles
good
night
my
dear
boy
kiss
me
remember
that
your
mother
is
now
in
the
same
house
with
you
and
sleep
in
the
boy
quitted
the
room
reginald
said
the
mother
i
have
no
wish
to
control
your
desires
or
be
a
spy
upon
your
actions
but
your
conduct
seems
so
extraordinary
in
this
instance
as
to
dispense
me
from
the
observation
of
common
rules
i
have
always
been
a
complying
wife
i
have
never
set
myself
in
contradiction
to
your
will
i
appeal
to
yourself
for
the
truth
of
this
i
despise
however
those
delicacies
an
adherence
to
which
would
entail
upon
us
the
sacrifice
of
all
that
is
most
valuable
in
human
life
can
i
shut
my
ears
upon
the
mysterious
expressions
which
charles
s
complaints
have
extorted
from
you
can
i
be
insensible
to
the
extraordinary
purpose
you
declare
of
leaving
me
when
i
have
yet
been
scarcely
half
an
hour
under
the
roof
with
you
before
charles
came
in
you
seem
to
have
entertained
no
such
my
love
replied
i
how
seriously
you
comment
upon
the
most
insignificant
incident
is
it
extraordinary
that
your
unexpected
arrival
should
at
first
have
made
me
forget
an
engagement
that
i
now
recollect
st
leon
answered
my
wife
before
you
indulge
in
surprise
at
my
earnestness
recollect
the
circumstances
that
immediately
preceded
it
through
successive
weeks
i
have
waited
for
some
satisfactory
and
agreeable
intelligence
from
you
i
had
a
right
before
this
to
have
expected
your
return
uncertainty
and
a
thousand
fearful
apprehensions
have
at
length
driven
me
from
my
home
and
brought
me
to
paris
i
am
come
here
for
satisfaction
to
my
doubts
and
peace
to
my
anxious
heart
wonder
not
therefore
if
you
find
something
more
earnest
and
determined
in
my
proceedings
now
than
upon
ordinary
occasions
give
me
i
conjure
you
give
me
ease
and
relief
if
you
are
able
if
not
at
least
allow
me
this
consolation
to
know
the
worst
be
pacified
marguerite
i
rejoined
i
am
grieved
heaven
knows
how
deeply
grieved
to
have
occasioned
you
a
moment
s
pain
but
since
you
lay
so
much
stress
upon
this
circumstance
depend
upon
it
i
will
postpone
the
business
i
was
going
about
and
stay
with
this
concession
voluntary
and
sincere
produced
an
effect
that
i
had
not
foreseen
marguerite
gazed
for
a
moment
in
my
face
and
then
threw
herself
upon
my
neck
forgive
me
my
beloved
husband
she
cried
you
indeed
make
me
ashamed
of
myself
i
feel
myself
inexcusable
i
feel
that
i
have
been
brooding
over
imaginary
evils
and
creating
the
misery
that
corroded
my
heart
how
inexpressibly
you
rise
my
superior
but
i
will
conquer
my
weakness
i
insist
upon
your
going
to
the
engagement
you
have
made
and
will
henceforth
place
the
most
entire
confidence
in
your
prudence
and
every
word
of
this
speech
was
a
dagger
to
my
heart
what
were
my
feelings
while
this
admirable
woman
was
taking
shame
to
herself
for
her
suspicions
and
pouring
out
her
soul
in
commendation
of
my
integrity
i
looked
inward
and
found
every
thing
there
the
reverse
of
her
apprehension
a
scene
of
desolation
and
remorse
i
embraced
her
in
silence
my
heart
panted
upon
her
bosom
and
seemed
bursting
with
a
secret
that
it
was
death
to
reveal
i
ought
in
return
for
her
generosity
to
have
given
up
my
feigned
engagement
and
devoted
this
night
at
least
to
console
and
pacify
her
but
i
could
not
and
i
dared
not
the
wound
of
my
bosom
was
opened
and
would
not
be
closed
the
more
i
loved
her
for
her
confidence
the
less
i
could
endure
myself
in
her
presence
to
play
the
hypocrite
for
so
many
hours
to
assume
a
face
of
tranquillity
and
joy
while
all
within
was
tumult
and
horror
was
a
task
too
mighty
for
human
powers
to
execute
i
accepted
of
marguerite
s
permission
and
left
her
even
in
the
short
interval
before
i
quitted
the
house
my
carriage
was
near
to
betraying
me
i
could
perceive
her
watchful
of
my
countenance
as
if
again
suspicious
that
some
fatal
secret
lurked
in
my
mind
she
said
nothing
further
upon
the
subject
however
and
i
presently
escaped
the
inquisition
of
her
eye
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
describe
the
state
of
my
mind
as
i
passed
along
the
streets
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
every
thing
i
had
felt
before
from
the
passion
of
gaming
was
trivial
to
the
sensations
that
now
occupied
me
now
first
it
stood
confessed
before
me
a
demon
that
poisoned
all
my
joys
that
changed
the
transport
of
a
meeting
with
the
adored
of
my
soul
into
anguish
that
drove
me
forth
from
her
yet
untasted
charms
a
solitary
wanderer
on
the
face
of
the
earth
my
busy
soul
drew
forth
at
length
the
picture
of
what
this
encounter
would
have
been
if
it
had
been
sanctified
with
the
stamp
of
conscious
innocence
at
one
moment
i
felt
myself
the
most
accursed
of
mankind
i
believed
that
he
who
could
find
as
i
did
barrenness
and
blasting
in
the
choicest
of
heaven
s
blessings
must
be
miserable
beyond
precedent
or
hope
shortly
after
however
i
reviewed
again
the
image
of
my
poison
and
found
in
it
the
promise
of
a
cure
the
more
desperate
my
case
appeared
to
me
with
the
greater
insanity
of
expectation
did
i
assure
myself
that
this
one
night
should
retrieve
all
my
misfortunes
in
giving
to
it
this
destination
indeed
i
should
afflict
the
gentle
bosom
of
my
wife
but
too
probably
with
some
hours
of
uneasiness
but
the
event
would
richly
repay
her
for
so
transitory
a
suffering
i
would
then
open
my
whole
mind
to
her
i
would
practise
no
more
reserves
i
should
no
longer
be
driven
to
the
refuge
of
a
vile
hypocrisy
i
would
bid
farewell
to
the
frowns
and
the
caresses
of
fortune
i
would
require
of
her
no
further
kindnesses
if
i
were
incapable
myself
of
a
rigid
economy
i
would
commit
implicitly
to
marguerite
the
disposal
of
my
income
whom
i
knew
to
be
every
way
qualified
for
the
office
with
these
reflections
i
nerved
my
mind
to
the
most
decisive
adventures
why
should
i
enter
into
a
long
detail
of
the
incidents
of
this
crisis
soon
though
not
immediately
i
began
to
lose
considerable
sums
i
brought
with
me
in
the
first
instance
a
penetrating
eye
a
collected
mind
an
intellect
prepared
for
unintermitted
exertion
misfortune
subverted
all
this
my
eye
grew
wild
my
soul
tempestuous
my
thoughts
incoherent
and
distracted
i
was
incapable
of
any
thing
judicious
but
i
was
determined
to
persevere
i
played
till
morning
nor
could
the
light
of
morning
induce
me
to
desist
the
setting
sun
of
that
day
beheld
me
a
beggar
there
is
a
degree
of
misery
which
as
it
admits
of
no
description
so
does
it
leave
no
distinct
traces
in
the
memory
it
seems
as
if
the
weakness
of
the
human
mind
alike
incapacitated
it
to
support
the
delirium
of
joy
and
the
extremity
of
sorrow
of
what
immediately
succeeded
the
period
to
which
i
have
conducted
my
narrative
i
have
no
recollection
but
a
horror
beyond
all
names
of
horror
wild
inexplicable
unintelligible
let
no
one
however
imagine
that
the
temporary
desertion
of
the
soul
is
any
alleviation
of
its
misery
the
mind
that
sinks
under
its
suffering
does
not
by
that
conduct
shake
off
its
burden
rather
ten
thousand
times
rather
would
i
endure
all
the
calamities
that
have
ever
yet
received
a
name
the
sensations
and
history
of
which
are
capable
of
being
delineated
than
sustain
that
which
has
no
words
by
which
to
express
itself
and
the
conception
of
which
must
be
trusted
solely
to
the
faculties
and
sympathy
of
the
reader
where
is
the
cold
and
inapprehensive
spirit
that
talks
of
madness
as
a
refuge
from
sorrow
oh
dull
and
unconceiving
beyond
all
belief
i
can
not
speak
of
every
species
of
madness
but
i
also
have
been
mad
this
i
know
that
there
is
a
vacancy
of
soul
where
all
appears
buried
in
stupidity
and
scarcely
deserves
the
name
of
thought
that
is
more
intolerable
than
the
bitterest
reflections
this
i
know
that
there
is
an
incoherence
in
which
the
mind
seems
to
wander
without
rudder
and
pilot
that
laughs
to
scorn
the
superstitious
fictions
of
designing
priests
oh
how
many
sleepless
days
and
weeks
did
i
endure
the
thoughts
frantic
the
tongue
raving
while
we
can
still
adhere
if
i
may
so
express
myself
to
the
method
of
misery
there
is
a
sort
of
nameless
complacency
that
lurks
under
all
that
we
can
endure
we
are
still
conscious
that
we
are
men
we
wonder
at
and
admire
our
powers
of
being
miserable
but
when
the
masts
and
tackle
of
the
intellectual
vessel
are
all
swept
away
then
is
the
true
sadness
we
have
no
consciousness
to
sustain
us
no
sentiment
of
dignity
no
secret
admiration
of
what
we
are
still
clinging
to
our
hearts
all
this
i
venture
to
affirm
with
the
full
recollection
of
what
i
suffered
when
restored
to
my
senses
present
to
my
mind
when
the
account
was
closed
and
the
loss
of
my
last
stake
had
finished
the
scene
i
rose
and
quitting
the
fatal
spot
where
these
transactions
had
passed
entered
the
street
with
a
heart
oppressed
and
a
bursting
head
my
eyes
glared
but
i
saw
nothing
and
could
think
of
nothing
it
was
already
nearly
dark
and
the
day
which
had
been
tempestuous
was
succeeded
by
a
heavy
and
settled
rain
i
wandered
for
some
time
not
knowing
whither
i
went
my
pace
which
had
at
first
been
slow
gradually
increased
and
i
traversed
the
whole
city
with
a
hurried
and
impatient
step
the
streets
which
had
contained
few
persons
at
first
gradually
lost
those
few
i
was
almost
alone
i
saw
occasionally
ragged
and
houseless
misery
shrinking
under
the
cover
of
a
miserable
shed
i
saw
the
midnight
robber
watching
for
his
prey
and
ready
to
start
upon
the
unwary
passenger
from
me
he
fled
there
was
something
in
my
air
that
impelled
even
desperate
violation
to
shrink
from
the
encounter
i
continued
this
incessant
unmeaning
exertion
for
hours
at
length
by
an
accidental
glance
of
the
eye
i
found
myself
at
the
gate
of
my
own
hotel
heedless
of
what
i
did
i
entered
and
as
nature
was
now
completely
exhausted
within
me
sunk
down
in
a
sort
of
insensibility
at
the
foot
of
the
grand
staircase
this
stupor
after
a
considerable
interval
gradually
subsided
i
opened
my
eyes
and
saw
various
figures
flitting
about
me
but
i
seemed
to
myself
equally
incapable
of
collecting
my
thoughts
and
of
speech
my
understanding
indeed
shortly
became
clearer
but
an
insuperable
reluctance
to
voluntary
exertion
hung
upon
me
i
explained
myself
only
in
monosyllables
a
sort
of
instinctive
terror
of
disclosing
what
had
passed
to
the
admirable
woman
i
had
sacrificed
maintained
in
me
this
perpetual
reserve
for
several
days
together
i
sat
from
morning
till
night
in
one
immovable
posture
nor
was
any
thing
of
force
enough
to
awaken
me
to
exertion
chapter
vii
it
was
not
long
before
the
unhappy
partner
of
my
fortunes
was
informed
of
what
had
passed
the
wretches
who
had
stripped
me
of
my
all
soon
made
their
appearance
to
claim
what
was
no
longer
mine
what
would
have
been
their
reception
if
i
had
sufficiently
possessed
myself
to
parley
with
them
on
the
subject
i
am
unable
to
determine
i
could
not
have
preserved
the
wreck
of
my
property
from
their
grasp
but
at
the
expense
of
an
indelible
stain
upon
my
honour
yet
my
desperation
would
probably
have
led
me
to
a
conduct
equally
extravagant
and
useless
in
the
condition
in
which
i
was
the
whole
direction
of
the
business
devolved
upon
marguerite
and
never
did
human
creature
demean
herself
with
greater
magnanimity
and
propriety
she
saw
at
once
that
she
could
not
resist
their
claims
but
at
the
expense
of
my
reputation
for
herself
she
valued
not
riches
and
had
no
dread
of
poverty
and
thus
circumstanced
she
had
the
courage
herself
to
bring
to
me
the
papers
they
offered
the
object
of
which
i
scarcely
understood
and
to
cause
me
to
annex
that
signature
which
was
to
strip
her
and
her
children
of
all
earthly
fortune
her
purpose
was
as
soon
as
this
business
was
over
to
cause
us
to
quit
france
and
retire
into
some
scene
of
virtuous
obscurity
but
she
would
not
leave
behind
her
for
the
last
descendants
of
the
counts
de
leon
any
avoidable
disgrace
her
mode
of
reasoning
upon
the
subject
was
extremely
simple
obscurity
she
regarded
as
no
misfortune
and
eminent
situation
where
it
fairly
presented
itself
as
a
responsibility
it
would
be
base
to
shrink
from
ignominy
alone
she
considered
as
the
proper
theme
of
abhorrence
for
the
fickleness
and
inconstancy
of
fortune
it
is
impossible
to
answer
by
one
of
those
reverses
in
which
she
appears
to
delight
she
might
yet
restore
us
to
the
lustre
of
our
former
condition
but
if
the
name
of
leon
was
henceforth
to
disappear
from
the
annals
of
france
she
was
desirous
at
least
as
far
as
depended
on
her
that
it
should
expire
like
the
far
famed
bird
of
arabia
in
the
midst
of
perfumes
when
the
whole
situation
of
marguerite
is
taken
into
consideration
the
reader
like
myself
will
stand
astonished
at
the
fortitude
of
her
conduct
she
had
come
to
paris
unable
any
longer
to
tranquillise
the
agitation
of
her
mind
and
exhausted
with
fears
suspicions
and
alarms
when
she
arrived
she
experienced
indeed
one
delusive
moment
of
transport
and
joy
but
that
was
soon
over
it
was
succeeded
by
reflections
and
conjectures
respecting
the
mysteriousness
of
my
behaviour
it
was
succeeded
by
my
unexpected
departure
and
the
hourly
expectation
of
my
return
after
the
lapse
of
a
night
and
a
day
i
returned
indeed
but
in
what
a
condition
drenched
with
rain
trembling
with
inanition
speechless
and
alone
scarcely
had
she
received
notice
of
my
arrival
and
come
forward
to
meet
me
than
she
saw
me
fall
motionless
and
insensible
at
her
feet
she
watched
my
recovery
and
hung
with
indescribable
expectation
over
my
couch
she
was
only
called
away
by
the
wretches
who
came
to
advance
their
accursed
claims
and
to
visit
her
with
the
intelligence
of
our
ruin
as
with
a
thunderbolt
already
enfeebled
and
alarmed
by
all
the
preceding
circumstances
they
spoke
with
no
consideration
to
her
weakness
they
stooped
to
no
qualifications
and
palliatives
but
disclosed
the
whole
in
the
most
abrupt
and
shocking
manner
any
other
woman
would
have
sunk
under
this
accumulation
of
marguerite
only
borrowed
vigour
from
her
situation
and
rose
in
proportion
to
the
pressure
of
the
calamity
she
took
her
resolution
at
once
and
answered
them
in
the
most
firm
and
decisive
language
the
period
of
inactivity
and
stupor
that
at
first
seized
me
was
succeeded
by
a
period
of
frenzy
it
was
in
this
condition
that
marguerite
conducted
me
and
my
children
to
an
obscure
retreat
in
the
canton
of
soleure
in
the
republic
of
switzerland
cheapness
was
the
first
object
for
the
most
miserable
pittance
was
all
she
had
saved
from
the
wreck
of
our
fortune
she
had
not
chosen
for
beauty
of
situation
or
magnificence
of
prospects
the
shock
her
mind
had
sustained
was
not
so
great
as
to
destroy
her
activity
and
fortitude
but
it
left
her
little
leisure
for
the
wantonness
of
studied
indulgence
the
scene
was
remote
and
somewhat
sterile
she
conceived
that
when
i
recovered
my
senses
an
event
which
she
did
not
cease
to
promise
herself
solitude
would
be
most
grateful
at
least
to
the
first
stage
of
my
returning
reason
hither
then
it
was
that
she
led
me
our
son
and
three
daughters
immediately
upon
our
arrival
she
purchased
a
small
and
obscure
but
neat
cottage
and
attired
herself
and
her
children
in
habits
similar
to
those
of
the
neighbouring
peasants
my
paternal
estates
as
well
as
those
which
had
fallen
to
me
by
marriage
had
all
been
swallowed
up
in
the
gulf
which
my
accursed
conduct
had
prepared
marguerite
made
a
general
sale
of
our
moveables
our
ornaments
and
even
our
clothes
a
few
books
guided
by
the
attachment
to
literature
which
had
always
attended
me
were
all
that
she
saved
from
the
wreck
a
considerable
part
of
the
sum
thus
produced
was
appropriated
by
my
creditors
marguerite
had
the
prudence
and
skill
to
satisfy
them
all
and
was
contented
to
retain
that
only
which
remained
when
their
demands
were
discharged
this
was
the
last
dictate
of
her
pride
and
the
integrity
of
her
nature
at
the
time
that
she
thus
departed
a
voluntary
exile
from
her
native
country
two
servants
accompanied
us
in
our
flight
whose
attachment
was
so
great
that
even
if
their
attendance
had
not
been
necessary
it
would
have
been
found
somewhat
difficult
to
shake
them
off
marguerite
however
was
governed
by
the
strictest
principles
of
economy
and
whatever
the
struggle
might
have
been
with
the
importunity
of
humble
affection
in
dismissing
these
last
remains
of
our
profuse
and
luxurious
household
she
would
have
thought
herself
obliged
to
proceed
even
to
this
extreme
if
judicious
parsimony
had
demanded
it
from
her
but
it
did
not
our
youngest
daughter
was
at
this
time
only
twelve
months
old
and
it
would
have
been
scarcely
possible
for
the
mother
however
resolute
in
her
exertions
to
have
discharged
the
cares
due
to
such
a
family
at
a
time
when
the
father
of
it
was
suffering
under
so
heavy
an
affliction
one
female
servant
she
retained
to
assist
her
in
these
offices
she
could
not
dispense
herself
from
a
very
assiduous
attention
to
me
she
could
never
otherwise
have
been
satisfied
that
every
thing
was
done
that
ought
to
be
done
that
every
tenderness
was
exercised
that
might
be
demanded
by
my
humiliating
situation
or
that
sufficient
sagacity
and
skill
were
employed
in
watching
and
encouraging
the
gleams
of
returning
reason
the
violence
of
my
paroxysms
however
was
frequently
such
as
to
render
a
manual
force
greater
than
hers
necessary
to
prevent
me
from
effecting
some
desperate
mischief
bernardin
a
trusty
servant
nearly
of
my
own
age
and
who
had
attended
upon
my
person
almost
from
infancy
was
retained
by
marguerite
for
this
purpose
i
was
greatly
indebted
for
the
recovery
which
speedily
followed
to
the
affectionate
anxiety
and
enlightened
care
of
this
incomparable
woman
it
is
inconceivable
to
those
who
have
never
been
led
to
a
practical
examination
of
the
subject
how
much
may
be
effected
in
this
respect
by
an
attachment
ever
on
the
watch
and
an
understanding
judicious
to
combine
where
hired
attendance
would
sleep
and
the
coarseness
of
a
blunt
insensibility
would
irritate
nay
perhaps
mortally
injure
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
imagine
a
wife
more
interesting
and
admirable
than
marguerite
appeared
upon
the
present
occasion
fallen
from
the
highest
rank
to
the
lowest
poverty
she
did
not
allow
herself
a
mean
and
pitiful
regret
no
reverse
could
be
more
complete
and
abrupt
but
she
did
not
sink
under
it
she
proved
in
the
most
convincing
manner
that
her
elevation
was
not
the
offspring
of
wealth
or
rank
but
was
properly
her
own
she
gave
a
grace
even
a
lustre
to
poverty
which
it
can
only
receive
from
the
emanations
of
a
cultivated
mind
her
children
were
reconciled
and
encouraged
by
her
example
and
soon
forgot
those
indulgences
which
had
not
yet
had
time
to
emasculate
their
spirits
the
deplorable
situation
to
which
the
father
of
the
family
was
reduced
was
far
from
inducing
her
to
cease
from
her
efforts
in
the
bitterness
of
despair
she
determined
for
the
present
to
be
both
a
father
and
a
mother
to
her
children
she
looked
forward
with
confidence
to
my
speedy
recovery
though
i
was
the
author
of
her
calamities
she
did
not
permit
this
consideration
to
subtract
from
the
purity
of
her
affection
or
the
tenderness
of
her
anxiety
she
resolved
that
no
word
or
look
of
hers
should
ever
reproach
me
with
my
misconduct
she
had
been
accustomed
to
desire
rank
and
affluence
and
indulgence
for
her
children
that
her
son
might
run
the
career
of
glory
which
his
forefathers
ran
and
that
her
daughters
might
unite
their
fates
with
what
was
most
illustrious
and
honourable
in
their
native
country
but
if
she
were
disappointed
in
this
she
determined
as
far
as
it
should
be
in
her
power
to
give
them
virtue
and
cheerfulness
and
content
a
mind
that
should
find
resources
within
itself
and
call
forth
regard
and
esteem
from
the
rest
of
mankind
my
recovery
was
fitful
and
precarious
sometimes
appearing
to
be
rapidly
on
the
advance
and
at
others
to
threaten
a
total
relapse
among
the
expedients
that
marguerite
employed
to
the
slumbering
spark
of
reason
was
that
of
paternal
affection
ever
on
the
watch
for
a
favourable
opportunity
she
sometimes
brought
to
me
her
own
little
namesake
who
though
only
twelve
months
old
did
not
fail
to
discover
unequivocal
marks
of
that
playfulness
and
gaiety
which
made
so
considerable
a
part
of
her
constitutional
character
her
innocent
smiles
her
frolic
and
careless
laughter
produced
a
responsive
vibration
that
reached
to
my
inmost
heart
they
were
not
unfrequently
powerful
enough
to
check
the
career
of
my
fury
or
to
raise
me
from
the
lowest
pitch
of
despondence
julia
wept
for
me
and
louisa
endeavoured
to
copy
the
offices
of
kindness
she
was
accustomed
to
see
her
mother
perform
charles
who
conceived
more
fully
than
the
rest
the
nature
of
my
indisposition
was
upon
all
occasions
solicitous
to
be
admitted
into
my
presence
and
attended
me
for
the
most
part
with
speechless
anxiety
while
his
watchful
glistening
eye
uttered
volumes
without
the
assistance
of
words
his
mother
at
length
yielded
to
his
importunity
and
he
became
established
the
regular
assistant
of
bernardin
in
the
care
of
my
person
the
restlessness
and
impetuosity
he
had
hitherto
manifested
seemed
upon
this
occasion
entirely
to
subside
hour
after
hour
he
willingly
continued
shut
up
in
my
chamber
eager
for
every
opportunity
of
usefulness
and
gratified
with
that
complaisance
with
which
the
human
mind
never
fails
to
be
impressed
when
it
regards
its
actions
as
beneficent
or
approves
its
temper
as
compassionate
the
restoration
of
my
health
was
greatly
retarded
by
the
melancholy
impressions
which
necessarily
offered
themselves
to
my
mind
when
recollection
resumed
her
seat
it
was
fortunate
for
me
that
this
sort
of
retrospection
appears
not
to
be
the
first
thing
that
occurs
after
a
paroxysm
of
insanity
when
the
tide
of
incoherent
ideas
subsides
the
soul
is
left
in
a
state
of
exhaustion
and
seems
by
a
sort
of
instinct
to
shun
the
influx
of
tumultuous
emotions
and
to
dwell
upon
such
feelings
as
are
mild
tranquil
and
restorative
once
however
when
i
was
nearly
recovered
the
thought
of
what
i
had
been
and
the
recollection
of
what
i
was
violently
suggesting
themselves
to
my
mind
brought
on
a
relapse
attended
with
more
alarming
and
discouraging
symptoms
than
my
original
alienation
at
that
moment
marguerite
was
for
the
first
time
irresistibly
struck
with
the
conception
that
mine
was
an
incurable
lunacy
and
as
she
afterwards
assured
me
at
no
period
down
to
that
instant
had
she
felt
herself
so
truly
inconsolable
but
even
a
sentiment
of
the
last
despair
was
incapable
of
superseding
the
active
beneficence
of
marguerite
her
assiduities
so
far
as
related
to
this
fatal
calamity
were
at
length
crowned
with
success
her
gloomy
prognostics
were
not
realised
and
the
distemper
of
my
understanding
quitted
me
for
ever
wretched
however
as
i
have
already
remarked
beyond
all
common
notions
of
wretchedness
were
my
thoughts
when
my
soul
returned
to
its
proper
bias
and
i
fully
surveyed
the
nature
of
my
present
situation
marguerite
who
by
her
sagacity
and
patience
had
recovered
me
from
a
state
of
the
most
dreadful
disease
now
exerted
herself
to
effect
the
more
arduous
task
of
reconciling
me
to
myself
she
assured
me
that
she
forgave
me
from
her
inmost
heart
nay
that
she
was
thankful
to
providence
which
in
the
midst
of
what
the
world
calls
great
calamities
had
preserved
to
her
what
she
most
valued
my
affection
entire
she
contrasted
what
had
been
the
subject
of
her
apprehensions
before
she
came
to
paris
with
what
had
proved
to
be
the
state
of
the
case
afterwards
she
averred
that
the
worst
that
had
happened
was
trivial
and
tolerable
compared
with
the
image
that
her
fears
had
delineated
she
had
feared
to
find
my
heart
alienated
from
her
and
herself
a
widowed
mother
to
orphan
children
she
dreaded
lest
i
should
have
proved
myself
worthless
in
her
eyes
lest
i
should
have
been
found
to
have
committed
to
oblivion
the
most
sacred
of
all
duties
and
for
the
gratification
of
a
low
and
contemptible
caprice
to
have
sacrificed
all
pretensions
to
honour
and
character
for
that
indeed
her
heart
would
have
bled
against
that
all
the
pride
she
derived
from
her
ancestry
and
my
own
would
have
revolted
that
would
have
produced
a
revulsion
of
her
frame
snapping
the
chain
of
all
her
habits
and
putting
a
violent
close
upon
all
the
sentiments
she
had
most
fondly
nourished
she
dreaded
indeed
that
she
should
not
have
survived
it
but
the
mistake
i
had
committed
was
of
a
very
different
nature
i
had
neither
forgotten
that
i
was
a
husband
nor
a
father
i
had
only
made
an
injudicious
and
unfortunate
choice
of
the
way
of
discharging
what
was
due
to
these
characters
what
had
passed
was
incapable
of
impeaching
either
the
constancy
of
my
affections
or
the
integrity
of
my
principles
she
forgave
me
and
it
was
incumbent
upon
me
to
forgive
myself
she
assured
me
that
poverty
in
her
apprehension
was
a
very
slight
evil
and
she
appealed
to
my
own
understanding
for
the
soundness
of
her
judgment
she
bid
me
look
round
upon
the
peasantry
of
the
neighbourhood
upon
a
footing
with
whom
we
were
now
placed
and
ask
my
own
heart
whether
they
were
not
happy
one
disadvantage
indeed
they
were
subjected
to
the
absence
of
cultivation
and
learning
she
could
never
bring
herself
to
believe
that
ignorance
was
a
benefit
she
saw
the
contrary
of
this
practically
illustrated
in
her
own
case
in
mine
and
in
that
of
all
the
persons
to
whom
through
life
she
had
been
most
ardently
attached
she
wished
her
children
to
attain
intellectual
refinement
possess
fully
the
attributes
of
a
rational
nature
and
to
be
as
far
removed
as
possible
from
the
condition
of
stocks
and
stones
by
accumulating
a
magazine
of
thoughts
and
by
a
rich
and
cultivated
sensibility
but
the
want
of
fortune
did
not
in
our
case
as
in
the
case
of
so
many
others
shut
them
out
from
this
advantage
it
was
in
our
own
power
to
bestow
it
upon
them
it
was
the
part
of
a
reasonable
man
she
told
me
not
to
waste
his
strength
in
useless
regrets
for
what
was
past
and
had
already
eluded
his
grasp
but
to
advert
to
the
blessings
he
had
still
in
possession
if
we
did
this
in
our
present
situation
we
should
find
every
reason
for
contentment
and
joy
our
pleasure
in
each
other
and
the
constancy
of
our
attachment
was
unassailed
and
unimpaired
where
were
there
two
married
persons
she
would
venture
to
ask
who
had
more
reason
to
applaud
their
connection
or
to
whom
their
connection
was
pregnant
with
so
various
gratifications
from
ourselves
we
had
only
to
turn
our
thoughts
to
our
children
and
we
were
surely
as
singularly
fortunate
in
this
respect
as
in
each
other
charles
who
had
always
been
the
subject
of
our
pride
had
lately
exhibited
such
an
example
of
patient
sympathy
and
filial
affection
as
perhaps
had
never
been
equalled
in
a
child
so
young
the
sensibility
of
julia
the
understanding
of
louisa
and
the
vivacity
of
marguerite
were
all
of
them
so
many
growing
sources
of
inexhaustible
delight
our
children
were
intelligent
affectionate
and
virtuous
thus
circumstanced
she
entreated
me
not
to
indulge
that
jaundice
of
the
imagination
which
should
create
to
itself
a
sentiment
of
melancholy
and
discontent
in
the
midst
of
this
terrestrial
paradise
most
virtuous
of
women
now
perhaps
the
purest
and
the
brightest
among
the
saints
in
heaven
why
was
i
deaf
to
the
soundness
of
your
exhortations
and
the
generosity
of
your
sentiments
deaf
indeed
i
was
a
prey
to
the
deepest
dejection
they
appeared
to
me
the
offspring
of
misapprehension
and
paradox
supposing
in
the
mean
time
that
they
were
reasonable
and
just
in
the
mouth
of
her
who
uttered
them
i
felt
them
as
totally
foreign
to
my
own
situation
the
language
as
they
were
of
innocence
it
was
not
wonderful
that
to
an
innocent
heart
they
spoke
tranquillity
and
peace
marguerite
looked
round
upon
the
present
rusticity
and
plainness
of
our
condition
and
every
thing
that
she
saw
talked
to
her
of
her
merit
and
her
worth
if
we
were
reduced
she
was
in
no
way
accountable
for
that
reduction
it
had
been
the
test
of
her
magnanimity
her
patience
and
the
immutableness
of
her
virtue
she
smiled
at
the
assaults
of
adversity
and
felt
a
merit
in
her
smiles
how
different
was
my
situation
every
thing
that
i
saw
reminded
me
of
my
guilt
and
upbraided
me
with
crimes
that
it
was
hell
to
recollect
my
own
garb
and
that
of
my
wife
and
children
the
desertion
in
which
we
lived
the
simple
benches
the
unhewn
rafters
the
naked
walls
all
told
me
what
it
was
i
had
done
and
were
so
many
echoes
to
my
conscience
repeating
without
intermission
and
without
end
its
reproaches
sleep
was
almost
a
stranger
to
me
these
incessant
monitors
confounded
my
senses
in
a
degree
scarcely
short
of
madness
itself
it
is
the
property
of
vice
to
convert
every
thing
that
should
be
consolation
into
an
additional
source
of
anguish
the
beauty
the
capacity
and
the
virtue
of
my
children
the
affection
with
which
they
regarded
me
the
patience
and
attentiveness
and
forbearance
of
their
excellent
mother
were
all
so
many
aggravations
of
the
mischief
i
had
perpetrated
i
could
almost
have
wished
to
have
been
the
object
of
their
taunts
and
execration
i
could
have
wished
to
have
been
disengaged
from
the
dearest
charities
of
our
nature
and
to
have
borne
the
weight
of
my
crimes
alone
it
would
have
been
a
relief
to
me
if
my
children
had
been
covered
with
the
most
loathsome
diseases
deformed
and
monstrous
it
would
have
been
a
relief
to
me
if
they
had
been
abortive
in
understanding
and
odious
in
propensities
if
their
hearts
had
teemed
with
every
vice
and
every
day
had
marked
them
the
predestined
victims
of
infamy
the
guilt
of
having
stripped
them
of
every
external
advantage
would
then
have
sat
light
upon
me
but
thus
to
have
ruined
the
most
lovely
family
perhaps
that
existed
on
the
face
of
the
earth
the
most
exemplary
of
women
and
children
in
whom
i
distinctly
marked
the
bud
of
every
excellence
and
every
virtue
was
a
conduct
that
i
could
never
forgive
even
to
myself
oh
damville
damville
best
of
men
truest
of
friends
why
didst
thou
put
thy
trust
in
such
a
wretch
as
i
am
hadst
thou
no
presentiment
of
the
fatal
consequences
wert
thou
empowered
to
commit
thy
only
child
and
all
her
possible
offspring
to
so
dreadful
a
risk
indeed
it
was
not
well
done
it
was
meant
in
kindness
but
it
was
the
cruellest
mischief
that
could
have
been
inflicted
on
me
i
was
not
a
creature
qualified
for
such
dear
and
tender
connections
i
was
destined
by
nature
to
wander
a
solitary
outcast
on
the
face
of
the
earth
for
that
only
that
fearful
misery
was
i
fitted
why
misguided
misjudging
man
didst
thou
not
leave
me
to
my
fate
even
that
would
have
been
less
dreadful
than
what
i
have
experienced
wretch
that
i
am
why
do
i
reproach
my
best
benefactor
no
let
me
turn
the
whole
current
of
my
invective
upon
myself
damville
was
actuated
by
the
noblest
and
most
generous
sentiment
that
ever
entered
the
human
mind
what
a
return
then
have
i
made
and
to
what
a
benefit
all
the
previous
habits
of
my
mind
had
taught
me
to
feel
my
present
circumstances
with
the
utmost
acuteness
marguerite
the
generous
marguerite
stood
with
a
soul
almost
indifferent
between
the
opposite
ideas
of
riches
and
poverty
not
so
her
husband
i
had
been
formed
by
every
accident
of
my
life
to
the
love
of
splendour
high
heroic
feats
and
not
the
tranquillity
of
rural
retirement
or
the
pursuits
of
a
character
professedly
literary
had
been
the
food
of
my
imagination
ever
since
the
faculty
of
imagination
was
unfolded
in
my
mind
the
field
of
the
cloth
of
gold
the
siege
and
the
battle
of
pavia
were
for
ever
present
to
my
recollection
francis
the
first
bayard
and
bourbon
eternally
formed
the
subject
of
my
visions
and
reveries
these
propensities
had
indeed
degenerated
into
an
infantine
taste
for
magnificence
and
expense
but
the
roots
did
not
embrace
their
soil
the
less
forcibly
because
the
branches
were
pressed
down
and
diverted
from
their
genuine
perpendicular
that
from
a
lord
descended
from
some
of
the
most
illustrious
houses
in
france
and
myself
amply
imbued
with
the
high
and
disdainful
spirit
incident
to
my
rank
i
should
become
a
peasant
was
itself
a
sufficient
degradation
but
i
call
the
heavens
to
witness
that
i
could
have
endured
this
with
patience
if
i
had
endured
it
alone
i
should
have
regarded
it
as
the
just
retribution
of
my
follies
and
submitted
with
the
most
exemplary
resignation
but
i
could
not
with
an
equal
mind
behold
my
wife
and
children
involved
in
my
punishment
i
turned
my
eyes
upon
the
partner
of
my
life
and
recalled
with
genuine
anguish
the
magnificence
to
which
she
was
accustomed
and
the
hopes
to
which
she
was
born
i
looked
upon
my
children
the
fruit
of
my
loins
and
once
the
pride
of
my
heart
and
recollected
that
they
were
paupers
rustics
exiles
i
could
foresee
no
return
to
rank
but
for
them
and
their
posterity
an
interminable
succession
of
obscurity
and
meanness
a
real
parent
can
support
the
calamity
of
personal
degradation
but
he
can
not
bear
to
witness
and
anticipate
this
corruption
of
his
blood
at
some
times
i
honoured
marguerite
for
her
equanimity
at
others
i
almost
despised
her
for
this
integrity
of
her
virtues
i
accused
her
in
my
heart
of
being
destitute
of
the
spark
of
true
nobility
her
patience
i
considered
as
little
less
than
meanness
and
vulgarity
of
spirit
it
would
have
become
her
better
i
thought
like
me
to
have
cursed
her
fate
and
the
author
of
that
fate
like
me
to
have
spurned
indignant
at
the
slavery
to
which
we
were
condemned
to
have
refused
to
be
pacified
and
to
have
wasted
the
last
dregs
of
existence
in
impatience
and
regret
i
could
act
that
which
had
involved
us
in
this
dire
reverse
but
i
could
not
encounter
the
consequences
of
my
act
the
state
of
my
mind
was
in
the
utmost
degree
dejected
and
forlorn
i
carried
an
arrow
in
my
heart
which
the
kindness
of
my
wife
and
children
proved
inadequate
to
extract
and
the
ranklings
of
which
time
itself
had
not
the
power
to
assuage
the
wound
was
not
mortal
but
like
the
wound
of
philoctetes
poisoned
with
the
blood
of
the
lernean
hydra
i
dragged
it
about
with
me
from
year
to
year
and
it
rendered
my
existence
a
galling
burden
hardly
to
be
supported
a
great
portion
of
my
time
was
passed
in
a
deep
and
mournful
silence
which
all
the
soothings
that
were
addressed
to
me
could
not
prevail
on
me
to
break
not
that
in
this
silence
there
was
the
least
particle
of
ill
humour
or
sullenness
it
was
a
mild
and
passive
situation
of
the
mind
affectionate
as
far
as
it
was
any
thing
to
the
persons
around
me
but
it
was
a
species
of
disability
my
soul
had
not
force
enough
to
give
motion
to
the
organs
of
speech
or
scarcely
to
raise
a
finger
my
eye
only
and
that
only
for
a
moment
at
a
time
pleaded
for
forbearance
and
pardon
i
seemed
like
a
man
in
that
species
of
distemper
in
which
the
patient
suffers
a
wasting
of
the
bones
and
at
length
presents
to
us
the
shadow
without
the
powers
of
a
human
body
this
was
at
some
times
my
condition
but
my
stupor
would
at
others
suddenly
subside
mechanically
and
in
a
moment
as
it
were
i
shook
off
my
supineness
and
sought
the
mountains
the
wildness
of
an
untamed
and
savage
scene
best
accorded
with
the
temper
of
my
mind
i
sprung
from
cliff
to
cliff
among
the
points
of
the
rock
i
rushed
down
precipices
that
to
my
sobered
sense
appeared
in
a
manner
perpendicular
and
only
preserved
my
life
with
a
sort
of
inborn
and
unelective
care
by
catching
at
the
roots
and
shrubs
which
occasionally
broke
the
steepness
of
the
descent
i
hung
over
the
tops
of
rocks
still
more
fearful
in
their
declivities
and
courted
the
giddiness
and
whirl
of
spirit
which
such
spectacles
are
accustomed
to
produce
i
could
not
resolve
to
die
death
had
too
many
charms
to
suit
the
that
pursued
me
i
found
a
horrible
satisfaction
in
determining
to
live
and
to
avenge
upon
myself
the
guilt
i
had
incurred
i
was
far
from
imagining
that
the
evils
i
had
yet
suffered
were
a
mere
sport
and
ostentation
of
misery
compared
with
those
that
were
in
reserve
for
me
the
state
of
mind
i
am
here
describing
was
not
madness
nor
such
as
could
be
mistaken
for
madness
i
never
forgot
myself
and
what
i
was
i
was
never
in
that
delirium
of
thought
in
which
the
patient
is
restless
and
active
without
knowing
what
it
is
that
he
does
and
from
which
when
roused
he
suddenly
starts
shakes
off
the
dream
that
engaged
him
and
stands
astonished
at
himself
mine
was
a
rage
guided
and
methodised
by
the
discipline
of
despair
i
burst
into
no
fits
of
raving
i
attempted
no
injury
to
any
one
marguerite
therefore
could
not
reconcile
herself
to
the
placing
me
under
any
restraint
i
frequently
returned
home
with
my
clothes
smeared
with
the
soil
and
torn
by
the
briars
but
my
family
soon
became
accustomed
to
my
returning
in
personal
safety
and
therefore
whatever
was
the
uneasiness
my
wife
felt
from
my
excursions
she
preferred
the
enduring
it
to
the
idea
of
imposing
on
me
any
species
of
violence
the
state
of
my
family
presented
a
singular
contrast
with
that
of
its
head
marguerite
was
certainly
not
insensible
to
the
opposition
between
her
former
and
her
present
mode
of
life
but
she
submitted
to
the
change
with
such
an
unaffected
cheerfulness
and
composure
as
might
have
extorted
admiration
from
malignity
itself
she
would
perhaps
have
dismissed
from
her
thoughts
all
retrospect
to
our
former
grandeur
had
not
the
dejection
and
despair
that
seemed
to
have
taken
possession
of
my
mind
forcibly
and
continually
recalled
it
to
her
memory
for
my
sufferings
i
am
well
assured
she
felt
the
truest
sympathy
but
there
was
one
consideration
attending
them
that
imperiously
compelled
her
to
task
her
fortitude
they
deprived
me
of
the
ability
of
in
any
degree
providing
for
and
superintending
my
family
it
became
therefore
incumbent
upon
her
to
exert
herself
for
the
welfare
of
all
had
we
never
fallen
under
this
astonishing
reverse
i
might
have
spent
my
whole
life
in
daily
intercourse
with
this
admirable
woman
without
becoming
acquainted
with
half
the
treasures
of
her
mind
she
was
my
steward
and
from
the
result
of
her
own
reflections
made
the
most
judicious
disposition
of
my
property
she
was
my
physician
not
by
administering
medicines
to
my
body
but
by
carefully
studying
and
exerting
herself
to
remove
the
distemper
of
mind
unfortunately
no
distempers
are
so
obstinate
as
mental
ones
yet
had
my
distemper
had
any
lighter
source
than
an
upbraiding
conscience
i
am
persuaded
the
wisdom
of
marguerite
would
have
banished
it
she
was
the
instructor
of
my
children
her
daughters
felt
no
want
of
a
governess
and
i
am
even
ready
to
doubt
whether
the
lessons
of
his
mother
did
not
amply
supply
to
charles
his
loss
of
an
education
in
the
university
of
paris
the
love
of
order
the
activity
the
industry
the
cheerfulness
of
let
me
say
this
illustrious
matron
became
contagious
to
all
the
inhabitants
of
my
roof
once
and
again
have
i
stolen
a
glance
at
them
or
viewed
them
from
a
distance
busied
sometimes
gravely
sometimes
gaily
in
the
plain
and
have
whispered
to
my
bursting
heart
how
miserable
am
i
how
happy
they
so
insurmountable
is
the
barrier
that
divides
innocence
from
guilt
they
may
breathe
the
same
air
they
may
dwell
under
the
same
roof
they
may
be
of
one
family
and
one
blood
they
may
associate
with
each
other
every
day
and
every
hour
but
they
can
never
assimilate
never
have
any
genuine
contact
is
there
a
happier
family
than
mine
in
all
the
valley
of
this
republic
is
there
a
family
more
virtuous
or
more
cultivated
with
all
the
refinements
that
conduce
to
the
true
dignity
of
man
i
i
only
am
its
burden
and
its
stain
the
pleasure
with
which
i
am
surrounded
on
every
side
finds
a
repellent
quality
in
my
heart
that
will
not
suffer
its
approach
to
whatever
is
connected
with
me
i
communicate
misfortune
whenever
i
make
my
appearance
those
countenances
that
at
all
other
times
spoke
contentment
and
hilarity
fall
into
sadness
like
a
pestilential
wind
i
appear
to
breathe
blast
to
the
fruits
of
nature
and
sickliness
to
its
marguerite
expostulated
with
me
in
the
most
soothing
manner
upon
the
obstinacy
of
my
malady
my
reginald
my
love
said
she
cease
to
be
unhappy
or
to
reproach
yourself
you
were
rash
in
the
experiment
you
made
upon
the
resources
of
your
family
but
have
you
done
us
mischief
or
have
you
conferred
a
benefit
i
more
than
half
incline
to
the
latter
opinion
let
us
at
length
dismiss
artificial
tastes
and
idle
and
visionary
pursuits
that
do
not
flow
in
a
direct
line
from
any
of
the
genuine
principles
of
our
nature
here
we
are
surrounded
with
sources
of
happiness
here
we
may
live
in
true
patriarchal
simplicity
what
is
chivalry
what
are
military
prowess
and
glory
believe
me
they
are
the
passions
of
a
mind
depraved
that
with
ambitious
refinement
seeks
to
be
wise
beyond
the
dictates
of
sentiment
or
reason
there
is
no
happiness
so
solid
or
so
perfect
as
that
which
disdains
these
refinements
you
like
me
are
fond
of
the
luxuriant
and
romantic
scenes
of
nature
here
we
are
placed
in
the
midst
of
them
how
idle
it
would
be
to
wish
to
change
our
arbours
our
verdant
lanes
and
thickets
for
vaulted
roofs
and
gloomy
halls
and
massy
plate
alas
reginald
it
is
i
fear
too
true
that
the
splendour
in
which
we
lately
lived
has
its
basis
in
oppression
and
that
the
superfluities
of
the
rich
are
a
boon
extorted
from
the
hunger
and
misery
of
the
poor
here
we
see
a
peasantry
more
peaceful
and
less
oppressed
than
perhaps
any
other
tract
of
the
earth
can
exhibit
they
are
erect
and
independent
at
once
friendly
and
fearless
is
not
this
a
refreshing
spectacle
i
now
begin
practically
to
perceive
that
the
cultivators
of
the
fields
and
the
vineyards
are
my
brethren
and
my
sisters
and
my
heart
bounds
with
joy
as
i
feel
my
relations
to
society
multiply
how
cumbrous
is
magnificence
the
moderate
man
is
the
only
free
he
who
reduces
all
beneath
him
to
a
state
of
servitude
becomes
himself
the
slave
of
his
establishment
and
of
all
his
domestics
to
diminish
the
cases
in
which
the
assistance
of
others
is
felt
absolutely
necessary
is
the
only
genuine
road
to
independence
we
can
now
move
wherever
we
please
without
waiting
the
leisure
of
others
our
simple
repasts
require
no
tedious
preparation
and
do
not
imprison
us
in
saloons
and
eating
rooms
yet
we
partake
of
them
with
a
more
genuine
appetite
and
rise
from
them
more
truly
refreshed
than
from
the
most
sumptuous
feast
i
prepare
for
my
meal
by
industry
and
exercise
and
when
it
is
over
amuse
myself
with
my
children
in
the
fields
and
the
though
i
love
the
sight
of
the
peasants
i
would
not
be
a
peasant
i
would
have
a
larger
stock
of
ideas
and
a
wider
field
of
activity
i
love
the
sight
of
peasants
only
for
their
accessories
or
by
comparison
they
are
comparatively
more
secure
than
any
other
large
masses
of
men
and
the
scenes
in
the
midst
of
which
they
are
placed
are
delightful
to
sense
but
i
would
not
sacrifice
in
prone
oblivion
the
best
characteristics
of
my
nature
i
put
in
my
claim
for
refinements
and
luxuries
but
they
are
the
refinements
and
purifying
of
intellect
and
the
luxuries
of
uncostly
simple
taste
i
would
incite
the
whole
world
if
i
knew
how
to
do
it
to
put
in
a
similar
claim
i
would
improve
my
mind
i
would
enlarge
my
understanding
i
would
contribute
to
the
instruction
of
all
connected
with
me
and
to
the
mass
of
human
knowledge
the
pleasures
i
would
pursue
and
disseminate
though
not
dependent
on
a
large
property
are
such
as
could
not
be
understood
by
the
rustic
and
the
our
son
bred
in
these
fields
indeed
will
probably
never
become
a
or
figure
in
the
roll
of
military
heroes
but
he
may
become
something
happier
and
better
he
may
improve
his
mind
and
cultivate
his
taste
he
may
be
the
counsellor
and
protector
of
his
sisters
he
may
be
the
ornament
of
the
district
in
which
he
resides
he
may
institute
in
his
adoptive
country
new
defences
for
liberty
new
systems
of
public
benefit
and
new
improvements
of
life
there
is
no
character
more
admirable
than
the
who
unites
with
the
utmost
simplicity
of
garb
and
manners
an
understanding
fraught
with
information
and
sentiment
and
a
heart
burning
with
the
love
of
mankind
such
were
fabricius
and
regulus
among
the
ancients
and
such
was
tell
the
founder
of
the
helvetic
liberty
for
my
part
i
am
inclined
to
be
thankful
that
this
unexpected
reverse
in
our
circumstances
has
made
me
acquainted
with
new
pleasures
and
opened
to
my
mind
an
invaluable
lesson
if
you
could
but
be
prevailed
on
to
enter
into
our
pleasures
to
dismiss
idle
reproaches
and
pernicious
propensities
our
happiness
would
then
be
the
expostulations
of
marguerite
often
excited
my
attention
often
my
respect
and
sometimes
produced
a
sort
of
imperfect
conviction
but
the
conviction
was
transient
and
the
feelings
i
have
already
described
as
properly
my
own
returned
when
the
fresh
and
vivid
impression
of
what
i
had
heard
was
gone
it
was
in
vain
that
i
heard
the
praises
of
simplicity
and
innocence
i
was
well
pleased
to
see
those
who
were
nearest
to
me
not
affecting
contentment
but
really
contented
with
these
things
but
i
could
not
be
contented
for
them
the
lessons
of
my
education
had
left
too
deep
an
impression
i
could
myself
have
surrendered
my
claim
to
admiration
and
homage
as
a
penance
for
my
misdeeds
but
i
could
not
figure
to
myself
a
genuine
satisfaction
unaccompanied
by
these
accessories
and
this
satisfaction
i
obstinately
and
impatiently
coveted
for
those
i
loved
chapter
viii
while
i
murmured
in
bitterness
of
soul
at
the
lowness
to
which
my
family
was
reduced
a
still
heavier
calamity
impended
as
if
in
vengeance
against
the
fantastic
refinements
of
distress
over
which
i
brooded
i
was
wandering
as
i
had
often
done
with
a
gloomy
and
rebellious
spirit
among
the
rocks
a
few
miles
distant
from
the
place
of
our
habitation
it
was
the
middle
of
summer
the
weather
had
been
remarkably
fine
but
i
disdained
to
allow
the
gratifications
which
arise
from
a
pure
atmosphere
and
a
serene
sky
to
find
entrance
in
my
soul
my
excursions
had
for
some
days
been
incessant
and
the
sun
which
matured
the
corn
and
blackened
the
grapes
around
had
imbrowned
my
visage
and
boiled
in
my
blood
i
drank
in
fierceness
and
desperation
from
the
fervour
of
his
beams
one
night
as
in
sullen
mood
i
watched
his
setting
from
a
point
of
the
rock
i
perceived
the
clearness
of
the
day
subsiding
in
a
threatening
evening
the
clouds
gathered
in
the
west
and
as
night
approached
were
overspread
with
a
deep
dye
of
the
fiercest
crimson
the
wind
rose
and
during
the
hours
of
darkness
its
roarings
were
hollow
and
tempestuous
in
the
morning
the
clouds
were
hurried
rapidly
along
and
the
air
was
changed
from
a
long
series
of
sultriness
to
a
nipping
cold
this
change
of
the
atmosphere
i
disregarded
and
pursued
my
rambles
a
little
before
noon
however
the
air
suddenly
grew
so
dark
as
to
produce
a
sensation
perfectly
tremendous
i
felt
as
if
the
darkest
night
had
never
exceeded
it
the
impetuous
motion
to
which
i
had
been
impelled
partly
by
the
fever
in
my
blood
and
partly
by
the
turbulence
of
the
season
was
suspended
mechanically
i
looked
round
me
for
shelter
but
i
could
ill
distinguish
the
objects
that
were
near
me
when
a
flash
of
lightning
blue
and
sulphureous
came
directly
in
my
face
with
a
brightness
that
threatened
to
extinguish
the
organ
of
vision
the
thunder
that
followed
was
of
a
length
and
loudness
to
admit
of
no
comparison
from
any
object
with
which
i
am
acquainted
the
bursts
were
so
frequent
as
almost
to
confound
themselves
with
each
other
at
present
i
thought
only
of
myself
and
the
recent
habits
of
my
mind
were
not
calculated
to
make
me
peculiarly
accessible
to
fear
i
stood
but
rather
with
the
awe
that
inheres
to
a
cultivated
imagination
than
that
which
consists
in
apprehension
i
seemed
ready
to
mount
amidst
the
clouds
and
penetrate
the
veil
with
which
nature
conceals
her
operations
i
would
have
plunged
into
the
recesses
in
which
the
storm
was
engendered
and
bared
my
bosom
to
the
streaming
fire
meanwhile
my
thoughts
were
solemnised
and
fixed
by
observing
the
diversified
dance
of
the
lightnings
upon
the
points
of
the
rocks
contrasting
as
they
did
in
the
strongest
manner
with
the
darkness
in
which
the
rest
of
the
scene
was
enveloped
this
added
contention
of
the
elements
did
not
however
suspend
the
raging
of
the
wind
presently
a
storm
of
mingled
hail
and
rain
poured
from
the
clouds
and
was
driven
with
inconceivable
impetuosity
the
hailstones
were
of
so
astonishing
a
magnitude
that
before
i
was
aware
i
was
beaten
by
them
to
the
ground
not
daring
to
attempt
to
rise
again
i
simply
endeavoured
to
place
myself
in
such
a
manner
as
might
best
protect
me
from
their
violence
i
therefore
remained
prostrate
listening
to
the
force
with
which
they
struck
upon
the
earth
and
feeling
the
rebound
of
their
blows
from
different
parts
of
my
body
in
about
twenty
minutes
the
shower
abated
and
in
half
an
hour
was
entirely
over
when
i
began
to
move
i
was
surprised
at
the
sensation
of
soreness
which
i
felt
in
every
part
of
me
i
raised
myself
upon
my
elbow
and
saw
the
hailstones
in
some
places
lying
in
heaps
like
hillocks
of
ice
while
in
others
they
had
ploughed
up
the
surface
and
buried
themselves
in
the
earth
as
i
looked
further
i
perceived
immense
trees
torn
from
their
roots
and
thrown
to
a
great
distance
upon
the
declivity
to
the
noise
that
they
made
in
their
descent
which
must
have
been
astonishingly
great
i
had
been
at
the
time
insensible
such
were
the
marks
which
the
tempest
had
left
upon
the
mountains
in
the
plain
it
was
still
worse
i
could
perceive
the
soil
for
long
spaces
together
converted
into
a
morass
the
standing
corn
beaten
down
and
buried
in
the
mud
the
vines
torn
into
a
thousand
pieces
the
fruit
trees
demolished
and
even
in
some
places
the
animals
themselves
lambs
sheep
and
cows
strewing
the
fields
with
their
mangled
carcasses
the
whole
hopes
of
the
year
over
which
my
eyes
had
glanced
a
few
minutes
before
for
it
was
near
the
period
of
harvest
were
converted
into
the
most
barren
and
dreary
scene
that
any
quarter
of
the
globe
ever
witnessed
i
was
mounted
upon
a
considerable
eminence
and
had
an
extensive
prospect
of
this
horrible
devastation
as
i
stood
gazing
in
mute
astonishment
suddenly
a
fear
came
over
me
that
struck
dampness
to
my
very
heart
what
was
the
situation
of
my
own
family
and
their
little
remaining
property
amidst
this
dreadful
ruin
i
was
in
a
position
where
though
i
nearly
faced
our
habitation
a
point
of
the
rock
intercepted
it
from
my
sight
the
obstacle
was
but
a
small
one
yet
it
would
require
a
considerable
circuit
to
overcome
i
flew
along
the
path
with
a
speed
that
scarcely
permitted
me
to
breathe
when
i
had
passed
the
upper
rock
the
whole
extensive
scene
opened
upon
me
in
an
instant
what
were
my
sensations
when
i
perceived
that
the
devastation
had
been
even
more
complete
here
than
on
the
side
where
i
first
viewed
it
my
own
cottage
in
particular
which
that
very
morning
had
contained
and
i
hoped
continued
to
contain
all
that
was
most
dear
to
my
heart
seemed
to
stand
an
entire
solitude
in
the
midst
of
an
immense
swamp
marguerite
whose
idea
upon
our
retreat
into
switzerland
had
been
that
of
conforming
without
reserve
to
the
new
situation
that
was
allotted
us
had
immediately
expended
the
whole
of
what
remained
from
the
shipwreck
of
our
fortune
in
the
purchase
of
the
cottage
in
which
we
dwelt
and
a
small
portion
of
land
around
it
sufficient
with
economy
for
the
support
of
our
family
under
her
direction
the
hills
had
been
covered
with
vines
and
the
fields
with
corn
she
had
purchased
cows
to
furnish
us
with
milk
and
sheep
with
their
fleeces
and
had
formed
her
establishment
upon
the
model
of
the
swiss
peasantry
in
our
neighbourhood
reverting
to
the
simplicity
of
nature
appeared
to
her
like
building
upon
an
immovable
basis
which
the
clash
of
nations
could
not
destroy
and
which
was
too
humble
to
fear
the
treachery
of
courts
or
the
caprice
of
artificial
refinement
it
was
all
swept
away
in
a
moment
our
little
property
looked
as
if
it
had
been
particularly
a
mark
for
the
vengeance
of
heaven
and
was
more
utterly
destroyed
than
any
of
the
surrounding
scenes
there
was
not
a
tree
left
standing
there
was
not
a
hedge
or
a
limit
that
remained
within
or
around
it
chaos
had
here
resumed
his
empire
and
avenged
himself
of
the
extraordinary
order
and
beauty
it
had
lately
displayed
i
was
not
overwhelmed
with
this
astonishing
spectacle
at
that
moment
nature
found
her
way
to
my
heart
and
made
a
man
of
me
i
made
light
of
these
petty
accessories
of
our
existence
and
the
thought
of
my
wife
and
my
children
simply
as
they
were
in
themselves
filled
every
avenue
of
my
heart
for
them
and
them
alone
i
was
interested
it
was
a
question
for
their
lives
to
conceive
what
they
might
personally
have
sustained
was
a
horror
that
seemed
to
freeze
up
all
the
arteries
of
my
heart
i
descended
from
the
mountain
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
and
not
without
many
circuitous
deviations
that
i
proceeded
so
much
was
the
surface
changed
and
so
deep
and
miry
the
swamps
my
terror
increased
as
i
passed
near
to
the
carcasses
of
the
animals
who
had
fallen
victims
to
this
convulsion
of
the
elements
i
observed
with
inconceivable
alarm
that
the
dead
or
wounded
bodies
of
some
human
beings
were
intermingled
with
the
brute
destruction
i
stayed
not
to
enquire
whether
they
were
yet
in
a
state
to
require
assistance
the
idea
that
had
taken
possession
of
me
left
no
room
for
the
sentiment
of
general
humanity
a
little
further
on
i
distinctly
remarked
the
body
of
a
woman
at
some
distance
from
any
habitation
who
appeared
to
be
dead
destroyed
by
the
storm
near
her
lay
a
female
infant
apparently
about
six
years
of
age
my
attention
was
involuntarily
arrested
i
thought
of
louisa
that
sweet
and
amiable
child
so
like
her
admirable
mother
the
figure
was
hers
the
colour
of
the
robe
corresponded
to
that
in
which
i
last
saw
her
the
child
was
lying
on
her
face
with
all
the
impatient
emotions
of
a
father
i
stooped
down
i
turned
over
the
body
that
i
might
identify
my
child
it
was
still
warm
life
had
scarcely
deserted
it
i
gazed
upon
the
visage
it
was
distorted
with
the
agonies
of
death
but
enough
to
convince
me
still
remained
discernible
it
was
not
louisa
i
can
scarcely
recollect
a
period
through
all
the
strange
vicissitudes
of
my
existence
to
be
compared
with
this
if
i
had
not
felt
what
i
then
felt
i
could
never
have
conceived
it
human
nature
is
so
constituted
that
the
highest
degree
of
anguish
an
anguish
in
which
the
heart
stretches
itself
to
take
in
the
mightiness
of
its
woe
can
be
felt
but
for
a
few
instants
when
the
calamity
we
feared
is
already
arrived
or
when
the
expectation
of
it
is
so
certain
as
to
shut
out
hope
there
seems
to
be
a
principle
within
us
by
which
we
look
with
misanthropic
composure
on
the
state
to
which
we
are
reduced
and
the
heart
sullenly
contracts
and
accommodates
itself
to
what
it
most
abhorred
our
hopes
wither
and
our
pride
our
all
that
taught
us
to
rejoice
in
existence
wither
along
with
them
but
when
hope
yet
struggles
with
despair
or
when
the
calamity
abruptly
announces
itself
then
is
the
true
contention
the
tempest
and
uproar
of
the
soul
too
vast
to
be
endured
this
sentiment
of
ineffable
wretchedness
i
experienced
when
i
stooped
down
over
the
body
of
the
imaginary
louisa
and
when
i
hastened
to
obtain
the
certainty
which
was
of
all
things
most
terrible
to
me
the
termination
of
such
a
moment
of
horror
is
scarcely
less
memorable
than
its
intrinsic
greatness
in
an
instant
the
soul
recovers
its
balance
and
the
thought
is
as
if
it
has
never
been
i
clapped
my
hands
in
an
ecstasy
at
once
of
joy
and
astonishment
so
sure
did
i
seem
to
have
made
myself
of
my
misfortune
i
quitted
the
body
with
an
unburdened
heart
i
flew
towards
my
home
that
i
might
ascertain
whether
i
was
prematurely
speaking
comfort
to
my
spirit
at
length
i
reached
it
i
saw
the
happy
group
assembled
at
the
door
marguerite
had
entertained
the
same
terrors
for
me
with
which
i
had
myself
so
lately
been
impressed
we
flew
into
each
other
s
arms
she
hid
her
face
in
my
neck
and
sobbed
audibly
i
embraced
each
of
the
children
in
turn
but
louisa
with
the
most
heartfelt
delight
are
you
safe
papa
are
you
safe
my
child
were
echoed
on
every
side
a
spectator
unacquainted
with
what
was
passing
in
our
hearts
would
certainly
have
stood
astonished
to
see
the
transport
with
which
we
exulted
surrounded
as
we
were
with
desolation
and
ruin
after
an
interval
however
we
opened
our
eyes
and
began
to
ruminate
upon
the
new
condition
in
which
we
were
placed
marguerite
and
myself
watched
each
other
s
countenances
with
anxiety
to
discover
what
were
likely
to
be
the
feelings
of
either
in
this
terrible
crisis
be
of
good
heart
my
love
said
marguerite
do
not
suffer
the
accident
which
has
happened
entirely
to
overcome
there
was
a
mixed
compassion
tenderness
and
anxiety
in
the
tone
of
voice
with
which
she
uttered
these
words
that
was
inexpressibly
delightful
no
marguerite
replied
i
with
enthusiastic
impetuosity
i
am
not
cast
down
i
never
shall
be
cast
down
again
ruin
is
nothing
to
me
so
long
as
i
am
surrounded
with
you
and
our
dear
children
i
have
for
some
time
been
a
fool
in
the
midst
of
every
real
blessing
i
have
fashioned
for
myself
imaginary
evils
but
my
eyes
are
now
opened
how
easily
is
the
human
mind
induced
to
forget
those
benefits
with
which
we
are
constantly
surrounded
and
our
possession
of
which
we
regard
as
secure
the
feelings
of
this
morning
have
awakened
me
i
am
now
cured
of
my
folly
i
have
learned
to
value
my
domestic
blessings
as
i
ought
having
preserved
them
i
esteem
myself
to
have
lost
nothing
what
are
gold
and
jewels
and
precious
utensils
mere
dross
and
dirt
the
human
face
and
the
human
heart
reciprocations
of
kindness
and
love
and
all
the
nameless
sympathies
of
our
nature
these
are
the
only
objects
worth
being
attached
to
what
are
rank
and
station
the
homage
of
the
multitude
and
the
applause
of
fools
let
me
judge
for
myself
the
value
of
a
man
is
in
his
intrinsic
qualities
in
that
of
which
power
can
not
strip
him
and
which
adverse
fortune
can
not
take
away
that
for
which
he
is
indebted
to
circumstances
is
mere
trapping
and
tinsel
i
should
love
these
precious
and
ingenuous
creatures
before
me
better
though
in
rags
than
the
children
of
kings
in
all
the
pomp
of
ornament
i
am
proud
to
be
their
father
whatever
may
be
my
personal
faults
the
world
is
my
debtor
for
having
been
the
occasion
of
their
existence
but
they
are
endeared
to
me
by
a
better
principle
than
pride
i
love
them
for
their
qualities
he
that
loves
and
is
loved
by
a
race
of
pure
and
virtuous
creatures
and
that
lives
continually
in
the
midst
of
them
is
an
idiot
if
he
does
not
think
himself
happy
surrounded
as
i
am
now
surrounded
i
feel
as
irremovable
as
the
pillars
of
creation
nothing
that
does
not
strike
at
their
existence
can
affect
me
with
marguerite
viewed
me
with
surprise
and
joy
now
indeed
said
she
you
are
the
man
i
took
you
for
and
the
man
i
shall
henceforth
be
prouder
than
ever
to
call
my
husband
the
sorrow
in
which
you
lately
indulged
was
a
luxury
and
we
must
have
done
with
luxuries
you
will
be
our
protector
and
our
thus
saying
she
took
me
by
the
hand
and
motioned
me
to
view
with
her
the
devastation
that
had
been
committed
there
was
one
path
i
had
discovered
in
which
we
might
proceed
some
way
with
tolerable
ease
the
scene
was
terrible
we
were
indeed
beggars
a
whole
province
had
been
destroyed
all
the
corn
and
the
fruits
of
the
earth
most
of
the
trees
in
many
places
cattle
in
some
places
men
persons
who
had
been
rich
in
the
morning
saw
all
the
produce
of
their
fields
annihilated
and
were
unable
even
to
guess
by
what
process
fertility
was
to
be
the
comparatively
wealthy
scarcely
knew
how
they
were
to
obtain
immediate
subsistence
the
humbler
class
who
always
live
by
the
expedients
of
the
day
saw
nothing
before
them
but
the
prospect
of
perishing
with
hunger
we
witnessed
in
one
or
two
instances
the
anguish
of
their
despair
our
prospect
was
scarcely
in
any
respect
better
than
theirs
yet
we
felt
differently
we
were
more
impressed
with
the
joy
of
our
personal
escape
as
my
error
respecting
the
value
of
externals
had
been
uncommonly
great
the
sudden
revolution
of
opinion
i
experienced
was
equally
memorable
the
survey
indeed
that
we
took
of
the
general
distress
somewhat
saddened
our
hearts
but
the
sadness
it
gave
was
that
of
sobriety
not
of
dejection
it
was
incumbent
upon
us
to
make
a
strict
examination
into
the
amount
of
our
property
and
our
immediate
resources
and
in
this
office
i
united
myself
with
marguerite
not
only
with
a
degree
of
cheerfulness
and
application
the
perfect
contrast
of
my
whole
conduct
ever
since
our
arrival
in
switzerland
but
which
greatly
exceeded
any
thing
i
had
ever
before
exhibited
in
a
business
of
this
nature
we
found
that
though
all
our
hopes
of
a
harvest
were
annihilated
yet
we
were
not
destitute
of
the
instant
means
of
subsistence
the
resources
we
possessed
whether
in
money
or
provisions
that
were
our
dependence
till
the
period
when
the
new
produce
should
supply
their
place
were
uninjured
our
implements
of
husbandry
remained
as
before
the
land
was
not
impoverished
but
had
rather
derived
additional
fertility
from
the
effects
of
the
storm
what
we
had
lost
was
chiefly
the
produce
of
our
capital
for
one
year
together
with
a
part
of
that
capital
itself
in
the
live
stock
that
had
been
destroyed
this
was
a
loss
which
a
certain
degree
of
care
and
scope
in
our
external
circumstances
might
easily
have
enabled
us
to
supply
but
the
principle
of
supply
was
denied
us
it
was
with
considerable
difficulty
that
all
the
economy
of
marguerite
had
enabled
her
to
support
our
family
establishment
while
every
thing
of
this
kind
had
gone
on
prosperously
such
a
shock
as
the
present
we
were
totally
disqualified
to
surmount
it
compelled
us
to
a
complete
revolution
of
our
affairs
many
indeed
of
our
neighbours
had
scarcely
any
greater
advantage
in
their
private
affairs
than
ourselves
but
they
possessed
one
superiority
that
proved
of
the
greatest
importance
in
this
conjuncture
they
were
natives
of
the
state
in
which
they
resided
in
the
cantons
of
switzerland
the
destruction
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
occasioned
by
inclement
seasons
and
tempests
is
by
no
means
unfrequent
and
it
is
therefore
customary
in
plentiful
years
to
lay
up
corn
in
public
magazines
that
the
people
may
not
perish
in
periods
of
scarcity
these
magazines
are
placed
under
the
inspection
and
disposal
of
the
magistracy
and
the
inhabitants
looked
to
them
with
confidence
for
the
supply
of
their
need
no
storm
however
had
occurred
in
the
memory
of
man
so
terrible
and
ruinous
as
the
present
and
it
became
evident
that
the
magazines
would
prove
a
resource
too
feeble
for
the
extent
of
the
emergency
the
storm
had
spread
itself
over
a
space
of
many
leagues
in
circumference
not
only
in
the
canton
of
soleure
but
in
the
neighbouring
cantons
particularly
that
of
berne
the
sufferers
in
our
own
canton
only
amounted
to
scarcely
less
than
ten
thousand
while
the
women
and
children
for
the
most
part
remained
at
home
the
houses
having
in
general
suffered
little
other
damage
than
the
destruction
of
their
windows
the
fathers
of
families
repaired
to
the
seat
of
government
to
put
in
their
claims
for
national
relief
and
these
alone
formed
an
immense
troop
that
threatened
little
less
than
to
besiege
the
public
magazines
and
the
magistrates
an
accurate
investigation
was
entered
into
of
the
losses
of
each
it
being
the
purpose
of
government
as
far
as
its
power
extended
not
only
to
supply
the
people
with
the
means
of
immediate
subsistence
but
also
by
disbursements
from
the
public
treasury
to
recruit
the
stock
of
cattle
and
to
assist
every
one
to
return
with
revived
hopes
and
expectation
to
the
sphere
of
his
industry
the
purpose
was
no
doubt
benevolent
but
in
the
mean
time
the
unhappy
victims
found
in
uncertainty
and
expectation
a
real
and
corroding
anguish
i
advanced
my
claim
with
the
rest
but
met
with
a
peremptory
refusal
the
harsh
and
rigorous
answer
i
received
was
that
they
had
not
enough
for
their
own
people
and
could
spare
nothing
to
strangers
upon
this
occasion
i
was
compelled
to
feel
what
it
was
to
be
an
alien
and
how
different
the
condition
in
which
i
was
now
placed
from
that
i
had
filled
in
my
native
country
there
i
had
lived
in
the
midst
of
a
people
to
whom
the
veneration
of
my
ancestry
and
name
seemed
a
part
of
their
nature
they
had
witnessed
for
several
years
the
respectable
manner
in
which
i
lived
the
virtues
of
marguerite
were
familiar
to
them
and
they
took
an
interest
in
every
thing
that
concerned
us
a
sentiment
that
confessed
us
at
once
for
kindred
and
patrons
it
was
the
turn
of
mind
only
which
is
generated
by
rank
that
had
compelled
us
to
quit
their
vicinity
we
might
have
continued
in
it
if
not
in
affluence
at
least
enjoying
the
gratifications
that
arise
from
general
affection
and
respect
but
here
we
were
beheld
with
an
eye
of
jealousy
and
distaste
we
had
no
prejudice
of
birth
and
habit
in
our
favour
indeed
in
the
reverse
of
fortune
which
had
brought
us
hither
marguerite
had
been
less
desirous
of
obtruding
than
of
withdrawing
from
the
public
eye
the
circumstance
of
our
rank
we
were
too
recent
inmates
to
have
secured
by
any
thing
of
a
personal
nature
an
advantageous
opinion
among
our
neighbours
they
saw
only
a
miserable
and
distracted
father
of
a
family
and
a
mother
who
in
spite
of
the
simplicity
she
cultivated
sufficiently
evinced
that
she
had
been
accustomed
to
a
more
elevated
situation
the
prepossessions
of
mankind
are
clearly
unfavourable
to
a
an
emigrant
who
has
quitted
his
former
connections
and
the
scenes
of
his
youth
they
are
unavoidably
impelled
to
believe
that
his
taking
up
his
abode
in
another
country
must
be
owing
to
a
weak
and
discreditable
caprice
if
it
be
not
owing
to
something
still
more
disadvantageous
to
his
character
the
calamity
therefore
which
we
had
suffered
in
common
with
most
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
province
finally
reduced
us
to
the
necessity
of
a
second
emigration
the
jealousy
with
which
we
were
regarded
daily
became
more
visible
and
threatening
though
in
consequence
of
the
distribution
made
by
order
of
the
state
the
price
of
commodities
was
not
so
much
increased
as
might
have
been
expected
we
were
considered
as
interlopers
upon
the
portion
of
the
natives
the
sellers
could
with
difficulty
be
persuaded
to
accommodate
us
and
the
bystanders
treated
us
with
murmurs
and
reviling
while
we
were
deliberating
what
course
to
pursue
in
this
emergency
certain
officers
of
government
one
morning
entered
our
habitation
producing
an
order
of
the
senate
for
our
immediate
removal
out
of
the
territory
it
is
of
the
essence
of
coercive
regulations
to
expel
to
imprison
and
turn
out
of
prison
the
individuals
it
is
thought
proper
to
control
without
any
care
as
to
the
mischiefs
they
may
suffer
and
whether
they
perish
under
or
survive
the
evil
inflicted
on
them
we
were
accordingly
allowed
only
from
six
in
the
morning
till
noon
to
prepare
for
our
departure
our
guards
indeed
offered
to
permit
me
to
remain
three
days
to
wind
up
my
affairs
upon
condition
that
my
wife
and
children
were
instantly
removed
into
another
country
as
a
sort
of
hostages
for
my
own
departure
this
indulgence
however
would
have
been
useless
in
the
present
state
of
the
country
no
purchaser
could
be
found
for
the
little
estate
i
possessed
and
if
there
could
it
must
doubtless
have
been
disposed
of
to
great
disadvantage
at
such
an
emergency
i
know
not
how
we
should
have
extricated
ourselves
out
of
these
difficulties
if
a
member
of
the
senate
who
being
one
of
my
nearest
neighbours
had
been
struck
with
admiration
of
the
virtues
of
marguerite
and
with
compassion
for
my
family
had
not
paid
me
a
visit
shortly
after
the
arrival
of
the
officers
and
generously
offered
to
take
upon
himself
the
care
of
my
property
and
to
advance
me
what
money
might
be
necessary
for
my
emigration
this
offer
which
at
any
other
time
might
have
been
regarded
as
purely
a
matter
of
course
under
the
present
circumstances
when
capital
was
so
necessary
for
the
revival
of
agriculture
in
the
desolated
country
implied
a
liberal
and
disinterested
spirit
i
accepted
the
kindness
of
my
neighbour
in
both
its
parts
but
for
the
reimbursement
of
his
loan
referred
him
to
the
french
minister
to
the
united
cantons
who
under
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
and
taking
my
estate
as
security
for
the
money
advanced
i
thought
it
reasonable
to
believe
would
attend
to
my
application
chapter
ix
my
affairs
being
thus
far
adjusted
i
took
leave
of
my
late
habitation
and
set
off
with
my
wife
and
children
the
same
afternoon
in
the
evening
we
arrived
at
basle
where
we
were
permitted
to
remain
that
night
and
the
next
morning
were
conducted
in
form
out
at
the
north
gate
of
the
city
where
our
attendants
quitted
us
with
a
fresh
prohibition
under
the
severest
penalties
if
we
were
found
within
the
ensuing
twelve
months
in
any
of
the
territories
of
the
helvetic
republic
marguerite
and
myself
had
already
formed
our
plan
we
began
with
dismissing
both
our
servants
an
attendant
was
no
longer
necessary
to
me
nor
a
nurse
for
the
infant
the
suggestion
of
this
measure
originated
in
myself
my
temper
at
this
time
as
i
have
already
said
underwent
a
striking
change
i
was
resolved
to
be
happy
i
was
resolved
to
be
active
it
was
hard
to
part
with
persons
so
long
familiar
to
us
and
who
appeared
rather
in
the
character
of
humble
friends
than
domestics
but
an
imperious
necessity
demanded
it
let
us
said
i
to
marguerite
increase
and
secure
our
happiness
by
diminishing
our
wants
i
will
be
your
husbandman
and
your
labourer
you
may
depend
upon
my
perseverance
my
education
has
fitted
me
to
endure
hardship
and
fatigue
though
the
hardships
then
thought
of
were
of
a
different
nature
you
have
ever
delighted
in
active
usefulness
and
will
not
i
know
repine
at
this
accumulation
of
employment
let
us
accommodate
ourselves
to
our
circumstances
our
children
i
perceive
are
fated
to
be
peasants
and
will
therefore
be
eminently
benefited
by
the
example
of
patience
and
independence
we
shall
set
before
the
next
object
of
our
plan
related
to
the
choice
of
our
future
place
of
residence
this
originated
with
marguerite
she
had
heard
much
of
the
beauty
and
richness
of
the
country
bordering
on
the
lake
of
constance
and
she
thought
that
while
we
denied
ourselves
expensive
pleasures
or
rather
while
they
were
placed
out
of
our
reach
there
would
be
a
propriety
in
our
procuring
for
ourselves
a
stock
of
those
pleasures
which
would
cost
us
nothing
this
was
a
refinement
beyond
me
and
serves
to
evince
the
superiority
which
marguerite
s
virtue
and
force
of
mind
still
retained
over
mine
the
virtue
i
had
so
recently
adopted
was
a
strenuous
effort
i
rather
resolved
to
be
happy
than
could
strictly
be
said
to
be
happy
i
loved
my
children
indeed
with
an
unfeigned
affection
it
was
with
sincerity
that
i
professed
to
prefer
them
to
all
earthly
possessions
but
vanity
and
ostentation
were
habits
wrought
into
my
soul
and
might
be
said
to
form
part
of
its
essence
i
could
not
but
by
the
force
of
constant
recollection
keep
them
out
of
my
wishes
and
hopes
for
the
future
i
could
not
like
marguerite
suffer
my
thoughts
as
it
were
to
riot
and
wanton
in
the
pleasures
of
poverty
i
could
only
reconcile
myself
to
my
fate
by
a
sort
of
gloomy
firmness
the
tranquillity
i
seemed
to
have
attained
was
an
unnatural
state
of
my
soul
to
which
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
resolutely
hold
myself
down
and
from
which
my
thoughts
appeared
ever
upon
the
alert
to
escape
bitter
experience
had
at
length
taught
me
a
hard
lesson
and
that
lesson
i
was
determined
to
practise
whatever
pangs
my
resignation
might
cost
me
we
proceeded
without
hesitation
in
the
direction
we
had
resolved
to
pursue
our
whole
journey
exceeded
the
space
of
forty
leagues
in
extent
and
the
expense
necessarily
attendant
upon
it
our
family
even
after
its
reduction
consisting
of
no
less
than
six
persons
drained
our
purse
of
a
great
part
of
the
money
which
had
been
supplied
to
us
by
the
benevolent
senator
but
he
had
agreed
to
undertake
the
disposing
of
the
property
we
were
obliged
to
leave
behind
us
and
in
the
mean
time
if
any
considerable
interval
occurred
before
that
was
accomplished
to
furnish
us
with
the
sums
that
should
be
necessary
for
our
subsistence
we
placed
the
utmost
reliance
upon
his
fidelity
and
dismissed
from
our
minds
all
anxiety
respecting
the
interval
which
our
banishment
had
interposed
between
us
and
the
resources
necessary
for
our
future
settlement
upon
our
arrival
at
constance
we
found
a
letter
from
our
friend
and
though
he
transmitted
to
us
no
fresh
supply
the
complexion
of
his
communication
was
upon
the
whole
so
encouraging
as
to
determine
us
with
no
other
delay
than
that
of
four
days
rest
from
our
journey
to
pass
to
the
other
side
of
the
lake
and
explore
for
ourselves
a
situation
suitable
to
our
design
the
western
bank
of
the
lake
with
the
exception
only
of
the
city
of
constance
was
part
of
the
of
the
united
cantons
the
eastern
bank
was
a
territory
dependent
on
the
government
of
that
city
it
was
in
this
territory
that
we
purposed
fixing
our
residence
and
we
trusted
that
our
affairs
would
shortly
be
put
in
a
train
to
enable
us
to
take
possession
of
the
spot
we
should
select
thus
driven
once
more
into
flight
by
the
pressure
of
misfortune
and
compelled
to
exchange
for
a
land
unknown
the
scenes
which
familiarity
might
have
endeared
or
tender
recollections
have
made
interesting
we
did
not
sink
under
the
weight
of
our
adversity
this
removal
was
not
like
our
last
switzerland
was
to
none
of
us
endeared
like
the
vales
of
leon
i
was
not
now
goaded
and
tormented
by
conscious
guilt
in
the
degree
i
had
then
been
marguerite
was
not
afflicted
by
the
spectacle
of
my
misery
our
present
change
though
it
might
be
denominated
a
fall
was
light
in
comparison
with
the
former
the
composure
i
had
gained
was
new
to
me
and
had
to
my
own
mind
all
the
gloss
of
novelty
to
my
companions
it
proved
contagious
they
were
astonished
at
my
serenity
and
drew
from
it
an
unwonted
lightness
of
heart
thus
circumstanced
our
tour
had
its
charms
for
us
all
and
there
are
few
passages
of
my
life
that
i
have
felt
more
agreeably
the
lake
itself
is
uncommonly
beautiful
and
its
environs
are
fertile
and
interesting
it
is
surrounded
with
an
abundance
of
towns
villages
country
seats
and
monasteries
sufficient
to
adorn
and
diversify
the
view
but
not
to
exclude
the
sweetness
of
a
rural
scenery
or
the
grand
features
of
nature
we
coasted
a
considerable
part
of
the
lake
that
we
might
judge
in
some
degree
previously
to
our
landing
which
part
of
the
shore
promised
best
to
yield
us
the
object
we
sought
the
autumn
was
now
commencing
the
air
was
liquid
and
sweet
the
foliage
was
rich
and
varied
and
the
hills
exhibited
a
warmth
and
luxuriance
of
colouring
that
no
other
object
of
nature
or
art
is
able
to
cope
with
surrounded
with
these
objects
i
sat
in
my
boat
in
the
midst
of
my
children
and
as
i
was
but
just
awakened
to
an
observation
of
their
worth
and
my
own
happiness
i
viewed
them
with
a
transport
that
would
be
ill
illustrated
by
being
compared
with
the
transport
of
a
miser
over
his
treasure
from
the
bowels
of
the
deep
o
poverty
exclaimed
i
with
elevated
and
unconquerable
emotion
if
these
are
the
delights
that
attend
thee
willingly
will
i
resign
the
pomp
of
palaces
and
the
splendour
of
rank
to
whoever
shall
deem
them
worth
his
acceptance
henceforth
i
desire
only
to
dedicate
myself
to
the
simplicity
of
nature
and
the
genuine
sentiments
of
the
heart
i
will
enjoy
the
beauty
of
scenes
cultivated
by
other
hands
than
mine
or
that
are
spread
out
before
me
by
the
author
of
the
universe
i
will
sit
in
the
midst
of
my
children
and
revel
in
the
luxury
of
domestic
affections
pleasures
these
that
may
be
incumbered
but
can
not
be
heightened
by
all
that
wealth
has
in
its
power
to
bestow
wealth
serves
no
other
purpose
than
to
deprave
the
soul
and
adulterate
the
fountains
of
genuine
delight
such
was
the
spirit
of
exultation
with
which
my
mind
was
at
this
time
filled
i
am
sensible
that
it
was
only
calculated
to
be
transitory
i
might
learn
to
be
contented
i
was
not
formed
to
be
satisfied
in
obscurity
and
a
low
estate
thus
happy
and
thus
amused
we
spent
two
days
in
coasting
the
lake
landing
frequently
for
the
purposes
either
of
variety
or
enquiry
and
regularly
passing
the
night
on
shore
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
we
were
struck
with
the
neat
appearance
and
pleasing
situation
of
a
cottage
which
we
discovered
in
our
rambles
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
lake
we
found
that
it
was
to
be
sold
and
it
seemed
precisely
to
correspond
with
the
wishes
we
had
formed
it
was
at
a
considerable
distance
from
any
populous
neighbourhood
the
nearest
town
being
that
of
merspurg
the
usual
residence
of
the
bishops
of
constance
which
was
distant
from
this
spot
not
less
than
three
leagues
the
cottage
was
situated
in
a
valley
the
hills
being
for
the
most
part
crowned
with
rich
and
verdant
foliage
their
sides
covered
with
vineyards
and
corn
and
a
clear
transparent
rivulet
murmuring
along
from
east
to
west
in
the
distance
a
few
similar
cottages
discovered
themselves
and
in
front
there
was
an
opening
between
the
hills
just
wide
enough
to
show
us
a
few
sails
as
they
floated
along
the
now
even
surface
of
the
lake
we
approached
the
cottage
and
found
in
it
only
one
person
an
interesting
girl
of
nineteen
who
had
resided
there
from
her
birth
and
had
been
employed
for
the
last
four
years
in
attendance
upon
the
closing
scene
of
her
mother
her
mother
had
been
dead
only
a
few
weeks
and
she
was
upon
the
point
of
removing
as
she
told
us
to
the
house
of
a
brother
the
best
creature
in
the
world
who
was
already
married
and
had
a
family
of
children
while
we
were
talking
with
her
we
perceived
a
fine
boy
of
about
eleven
years
of
age
skipping
along
the
meadow
he
proved
to
be
her
nephew
and
hastened
to
say
that
his
father
and
henry
were
just
behind
and
would
be
with
her
in
a
few
minutes
we
waited
their
arrival
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
henry
was
by
no
means
an
indifferent
object
in
the
eyes
of
the
beautiful
orphan
she
had
probably
conditioned
that
he
should
permit
her
to
remain
single
as
long
as
she
could
be
of
any
use
to
her
mother
the
lovers
were
well
satisfied
that
the
girl
s
brother
should
be
taken
aside
that
i
might
talk
over
with
him
the
affair
of
the
cottage
we
made
a
tour
of
the
fields
that
were
part
of
the
property
of
the
deceased
and
the
terms
of
our
intended
purchase
were
easily
adjusted
though
we
had
now
accomplished
the
immediate
purpose
of
our
expedition
yet
as
we
had
found
unusual
exhilaration
and
sweetness
in
the
objects
it
presented
to
us
we
came
to
a
resolution
of
continuing
it
still
further
and
completing
the
circuit
of
the
lake
we
were
aware
that
it
would
be
vain
as
yet
to
expect
to
receive
the
money
requisite
for
completing
our
purchase
and
as
no
pleasure
merely
in
the
way
of
relaxation
could
be
more
delightful
than
that
we
were
now
enjoying
so
was
it
impossible
that
we
could
fill
up
our
time
in
a
more
frugal
manner
than
in
this
little
voyage
our
gratification
was
not
less
but
more
perfect
because
it
consisted
of
simple
inartificial
unbought
amusements
the
scenes
around
us
were
refreshing
and
invigorating
they
were
calculated
temporarily
at
least
to
inspire
gaiety
and
youth
into
decrepitude
itself
amidst
these
scenes
we
forgot
our
sorrows
they
were
a
kind
of
stream
in
which
weariness
and
dejection
plunged
their
limbs
and
came
forth
untired
and
alert
they
awakened
in
the
mind
all
its
most
pleasing
associations
having
already
as
we
believed
chosen
the
place
of
our
future
residence
we
busied
ourselves
in
imagining
all
the
accompaniments
that
would
grow
out
of
it
we
determined
that
poverty
with
health
would
not
fail
to
be
attended
with
its
portion
of
pleasures
the
scenes
of
nature
were
all
our
own
nor
could
wealth
give
them
a
more
perfect
or
a
firmer
appropriation
the
affections
and
charities
of
habitude
and
consanguinity
we
trusted
we
should
feel
uninterrupted
unincumbered
with
the
ceremonies
and
trappings
of
life
and
in
that
rural
plainness
which
is
their
genial
soil
after
a
leisurely
and
delightful
voyage
of
six
days
we
returned
to
constance
we
expected
to
have
found
on
our
return
some
further
intelligence
from
the
beneficent
senator
but
in
this
we
were
disappointed
the
imagination
however
easily
suggested
to
us
a
variety
of
circumstances
that
might
have
delayed
the
business
he
had
undertaken
and
it
was
no
forced
inference
to
suppose
that
he
deferred
writing
because
he
had
nothing
important
to
communicate
at
first
therefore
we
suffered
little
uneasiness
from
the
delay
but
as
time
proceeded
and
the
silence
of
our
protector
continued
the
affair
began
to
assume
a
more
serious
aspect
the
little
stock
we
had
brought
with
us
in
our
exile
was
in
a
rapid
progress
of
decay
we
had
managed
it
with
frugality
though
not
at
first
with
that
anxious
solicitude
the
necessity
of
which
we
now
began
to
apprehend
we
had
procured
for
ourselves
two
small
and
inconvenient
apartments
in
an
obscure
alley
of
the
city
of
constance
we
were
in
the
act
of
meditating
what
steps
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
in
this
unfortunate
emergency
when
intelligence
was
brought
us
of
the
sudden
decease
of
the
person
upon
whose
kindness
and
exertions
we
depended
he
was
succeeded
in
his
estate
by
his
nephew
a
man
of
whom
we
had
heard
something
during
our
residence
in
the
neighbourhood
and
whose
habits
we
understood
to
be
diametrically
the
reverse
of
his
predecessor
s
in
short
he
had
been
represented
to
us
as
illiberal
morose
selfish
and
litigious
a
man
who
having
suffered
in
one
part
of
his
life
the
hardships
of
poverty
scrupled
no
means
honourable
or
otherwise
of
removing
it
to
the
greatest
practicable
distance
he
had
already
reaped
the
succession
some
weeks
when
we
heard
of
the
event
that
put
him
in
possession
of
it
and
the
letters
which
i
had
more
than
once
addressed
to
our
protector
had
probably
fallen
into
his
hands
these
circumstances
afforded
no
favourable
augury
of
the
treatment
we
might
expect
from
him
the
first
thing
which
seemed
proper
was
to
write
to
him
which
i
accordingly
did
i
acquainted
him
with
the
nature
of
the
transaction
between
myself
and
his
uncle
and
signified
how
necessary
it
was
that
we
should
come
to
a
conclusion
as
speedily
as
possible
i
represented
to
him
pathetically
the
condition
to
which
i
was
born
and
the
opulence
in
which
i
had
passed
many
years
of
my
life
together
with
the
contrast
afforded
by
the
present
reduced
and
urgent
circumstances
of
my
family
i
entreated
him
to
exert
his
generosity
and
justice
in
behalf
of
an
unfortunate
exile
whom
untoward
events
had
deprived
of
the
power
of
doing
justice
to
himself
to
this
letter
i
received
no
answer
uncertain
as
to
the
cause
of
my
correspondent
s
silence
or
even
whether
my
letter
had
been
received
i
wrote
again
my
heart
was
wrung
with
this
new
adversity
i
was
forbidden
under
pain
of
perpetual
imprisonment
to
return
to
the
territories
of
the
republic
and
i
had
no
friend
to
solicit
in
my
behalf
in
constance
i
was
utterly
a
stranger
in
switzerland
my
unfortunate
habits
of
life
the
depression
and
solitude
in
which
i
had
been
merged
deprived
me
of
the
opportunity
of
forming
connections
the
deceased
was
the
only
person
who
had
been
disposed
to
interfere
for
me
it
was
too
probable
that
the
silence
of
his
successor
was
an
indication
of
the
hostility
of
his
views
i
saw
nothing
before
me
but
the
prospect
of
my
family
perishing
with
want
deprived
of
their
last
resource
exiles
and
pennyless
thus
destitute
and
forlorn
what
could
we
do
to
what
plan
could
we
have
recourse
we
had
not
so
much
as
the
means
of
providing
ourselves
with
the
implements
of
the
humblest
labour
if
we
had
could
i
under
my
circumstances
resolve
upon
this
could
i
give
up
the
last
slender
pittance
of
my
children
while
there
was
a
chance
of
recovering
it
and
by
surrendering
them
to
the
slavery
of
perpetual
labour
devote
them
to
the
lowest
degree
of
ignorance
and
degradation
no
i
still
clung
to
this
final
hope
and
was
resolved
to
undertake
any
thing
however
desperate
rather
than
part
with
it
such
were
my
feelings
and
in
the
new
letter
which
i
now
despatched
i
poured
out
all
the
anguish
of
my
soul
a
reply
to
this
letter
was
at
length
vouchsafed
the
heir
of
my
protector
informed
me
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
business
to
which
i
alluded
that
he
had
come
into
possession
of
the
lands
i
described
together
with
the
other
property
of
his
late
uncle
and
regarded
himself
as
holding
them
by
the
same
tenure
that
he
found
in
the
accounts
of
the
estate
a
sum
of
money
advanced
to
me
which
he
might
with
the
strictest
justice
regard
as
a
debt
and
pursue
me
for
it
accordingly
he
should
be
liberal
enough
however
so
far
to
give
credit
to
my
story
and
to
consider
the
sum
in
question
as
advanced
upon
a
pledge
of
land
in
that
case
i
might
regard
myself
as
sufficiently
fortunate
in
having
obtained
even
that
amount
at
a
time
when
but
for
the
humanity
or
weakness
of
his
uncle
my
estate
would
not
have
sold
for
a
farthing
meanwhile
the
forbearance
which
he
proffered
would
he
observed
depend
upon
my
conduct
and
be
retracted
if
i
afforded
him
cause
for
resentment
he
added
that
he
despised
my
menaces
and
commands
and
that
if
i
took
a
single
step
against
him
i
should
find
it
terminate
in
my
utter
ruin
nothing
could
be
more
profligate
than
the
style
of
his
letter
but
its
impotence
was
equal
to
its
wickedness
it
was
absurd
to
threaten
to
inflict
ruin
on
a
man
whom
ruin
had
already
overtaken
before
the
letter
arrived
i
had
disbursed
the
whole
sum
i
brought
with
me
from
switzerland
this
entire
annihilation
of
my
resources
seemed
to
steal
on
me
unperceived
finding
that
all
reply
to
my
importunity
was
either
refused
or
deferred
to
an
uncertain
period
i
would
willingly
at
all
risks
have
sought
the
villain
who
thus
obdurately
devoted
me
and
my
family
to
destruction
and
have
endeavoured
to
obtain
justice
in
person
but
it
was
now
too
late
before
i
felt
the
case
thus
desperate
my
finances
were
so
far
reduced
as
to
make
it
impracticable
for
me
to
leave
my
wife
and
children
enough
to
support
them
in
my
absence
even
if
i
had
determined
myself
to
set
out
upon
this
perilous
expedition
pennyless
i
resolved
that
if
we
did
perish
we
would
perish
together
penury
was
now
advancing
upon
us
with
such
rapid
strides
that
the
lowest
and
most
scanty
resources
no
longer
admitted
of
neglect
had
a
case
thus
desperate
been
encountered
with
timely
attention
it
is
not
improbable
that
some
of
the
various
talents
i
had
acquired
in
the
course
of
my
education
would
have
furnished
me
with
a
means
of
subsistence
not
altogether
plebeian
or
incompetent
but
with
the
uncertainty
of
my
situation
and
totally
unaccustomed
as
i
was
to
regard
my
person
or
mind
as
a
machine
fitted
for
productive
labour
i
had
not
looked
to
this
question
till
the
urgency
of
the
case
deprived
me
of
every
advantage
i
might
otherwise
have
seized
i
was
glad
therefore
to
have
recourse
to
menial
occupation
and
sought
employment
under
the
gardener
of
the
episcopal
palace
for
whose
service
i
was
sufficiently
qualified
by
my
ten
years
retreat
in
the
bordelois
that
i
might
better
adapt
myself
to
the
painful
necessity
of
my
situation
i
previously
exchanged
some
of
my
own
clothes
for
garments
more
suitable
to
the
business
i
now
solicited
it
was
not
till
i
had
arrived
within
a
very
few
days
to
the
end
of
my
resources
that
even
this
expedient
by
a
sort
of
accident
recurred
to
my
mind
marguerite
though
fully
aware
of
the
urgency
of
the
case
had
as
she
afterwards
told
me
imposed
on
herself
a
compulsory
silence
fearing
for
the
inflamed
and
irritated
frame
of
my
mind
and
aware
that
the
course
of
events
would
ultimately
lead
me
to
a
point
with
which
she
dreaded
to
intermeddle
this
was
for
her
a
trying
moment
my
lately
recovered
insanity
obliging
her
to
contemplate
in
silence
our
growing
distress
and
to
wait
the
attack
of
hunger
and
want
that
threatened
to
destroy
us
with
an
apparent
tranquillity
and
cheerfulness
for
me
so
entire
a
revolution
had
taken
place
in
my
sentiments
that
i
spurned
with
contempt
so
far
as
related
to
myself
that
pride
of
rank
and
romantic
gallantry
of
honour
which
had
formerly
been
my
idols
i
submitted
with
a
sort
of
gloomy
contentment
to
the
situation
upon
which
my
destiny
drove
me
i
regarded
it
as
the
natural
result
of
my
former
misconduct
and
derived
a
sentiment
of
ease
and
relief
from
thus
expiating
as
it
were
with
the
sweat
of
my
brow
the
temptations
to
which
i
had
yielded
had
i
been
myself
only
reduced
thus
low
or
had
the
produce
of
my
labour
been
sufficient
to
purchase
competence
for
my
wife
and
the
means
of
instruction
for
my
family
i
can
safely
affirm
that
i
should
have
found
no
consequence
so
direct
from
my
own
degradation
as
the
means
of
silencing
the
reproaches
of
conscience
and
reconciling
me
to
myself
but
when
i
returned
in
the
evening
with
the
earnings
of
my
day
s
labour
and
found
it
incompetent
to
the
procuring
for
those
who
depended
on
me
the
simplest
means
of
subsistence
then
indeed
my
sensations
were
different
my
heart
died
within
me
i
did
not
return
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
which
to
me
who
had
not
been
accustomed
to
unremitted
labour
and
who
now
began
to
feel
that
i
was
not
so
young
as
i
had
been
at
the
siege
of
pavia
were
extremely
trying
i
did
not
return
i
say
to
a
night
of
repose
i
became
a
very
woman
when
i
looked
forward
and
endeavoured
to
picture
to
myself
the
future
situation
of
my
family
i
watered
my
pillow
with
my
tears
often
when
i
imagined
that
my
whole
family
were
asleep
i
gave
vent
to
my
perturbated
and
distracted
mind
in
groans
marguerite
would
sometimes
overhear
me
and
with
the
gentlest
suggestions
of
her
admirable
mind
would
endeavour
to
soothe
my
thoughts
to
peace
for
the
present
as
i
have
said
my
earnings
were
incompetent
and
we
found
it
necessary
to
supply
the
deficiency
by
the
sale
of
the
few
garments
not
in
immediate
use
that
we
still
possessed
what
then
would
be
the
case
when
these
were
gone
and
when
in
addition
to
this
it
would
be
necessary
to
purchase
not
only
food
to
eat
and
a
roof
to
shelter
but
also
clothes
to
cover
us
chapter
x
these
deficiencies
i
anxiously
anticipated
but
there
was
another
evil
upon
which
i
had
not
calculated
that
was
still
nearer
and
more
overwhelming
the
mode
of
life
in
which
i
was
now
engaged
so
different
from
any
thing
to
which
i
had
been
accustomed
excessive
fatigue
together
with
the
occasional
heat
of
the
weather
the
uneasiness
of
my
mind
and
the
sleeplessness
of
my
nights
all
combined
to
throw
me
into
a
fever
which
though
it
did
not
last
long
had
raged
so
furiously
during
the
period
of
its
continuance
as
to
leave
me
in
a
state
of
the
most
complete
debility
while
the
disorder
was
upon
me
i
was
sensible
of
my
danger
and
as
the
brilliant
and
consolatory
prospects
of
life
seemed
for
ever
closed
upon
me
i
at
first
regarded
my
approaching
dissolution
with
complacency
and
longed
to
be
released
from
a
series
of
woes
in
which
i
had
been
originally
involved
by
my
own
folly
this
frame
of
mind
however
was
of
no
great
duration
the
more
nearly
i
contemplated
the
idea
of
separation
from
those
i
loved
the
smaller
was
my
resignation
i
was
unwilling
to
quit
those
dear
objects
by
which
i
still
held
to
this
mortal
scene
i
shrunk
with
aversion
from
that
barrier
which
separates
us
from
all
that
is
new
mysterious
and
strange
another
train
of
ideas
succeeded
this
and
i
began
to
despise
myself
for
my
impatience
and
cowardice
it
was
by
my
vices
that
my
family
was
involved
in
a
long
train
of
misfortunes
could
i
shrink
from
partaking
what
i
had
not
feared
to
create
the
greater
were
the
adversities
for
which
they
were
reserved
the
more
ought
i
to
desire
to
suffer
with
them
i
had
already
committed
the
evil
in
what
remained
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose
i
should
prove
their
benefactor
and
not
their
foe
it
was
incumbent
on
me
to
soothe
and
to
animate
them
to
enrich
their
minds
with
cheerfulness
and
courage
and
to
set
before
them
an
example
of
philosophy
and
patience
by
my
faculties
of
industry
i
was
their
principal
hope
and
whatever
we
might
suffer
combined
it
was
probable
their
sufferings
would
be
infinitely
greater
if
deprived
of
my
assistance
these
reflections
gave
me
energy
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
resolute
predilection
i
had
conceived
for
life
contributed
much
to
my
recovery
one
thing
which
strongly
confirmed
the
change
my
mind
underwent
in
this
respect
was
a
conversation
that
i
overheard
at
a
time
when
i
was
supposed
to
be
completely
in
a
state
of
insensibility
but
when
though
i
was
too
much
reduced
to
give
almost
any
tokens
of
life
my
faculties
of
hearing
and
understanding
what
passed
around
me
were
entire
charles
came
up
to
my
bedside
laid
his
hand
upon
mine
as
if
to
feel
the
state
of
the
skin
and
with
a
handkerchief
that
was
near
wiped
away
the
moisture
that
bedewed
my
face
he
had
been
fitted
for
many
offices
by
the
unwearied
attention
he
had
exerted
towards
me
in
the
paroxysm
of
my
insanity
having
finished
his
task
he
withdrew
from
the
bed
and
burst
into
tears
his
mother
came
up
to
him
drew
him
to
the
furthest
part
of
the
room
and
in
a
low
voice
began
the
conversation
do
my
dear
boy
go
down
stairs
and
get
yourself
something
to
eat
you
see
your
papa
is
quiet
i
am
afraid
that
will
not
last
long
and
then
he
will
be
so
restless
and
toss
about
so
it
is
dreadful
to
see
i
will
watch
charles
and
let
you
indeed
mamma
i
can
not
eat
now
i
will
by
and
you
must
try
to
eat
charles
or
else
you
will
make
yourself
quite
ill
if
you
were
ill
too
it
would
be
more
than
i
could
i
will
not
be
ill
mamma
i
assure
you
i
will
not
but
besides
that
i
have
no
stomach
i
can
not
bear
to
eat
when
there
is
hardly
enough
for
my
eat
boy
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
that
we
shall
get
more
when
that
is
gone
god
is
good
and
will
take
care
of
i
know
that
god
is
good
but
for
all
that
one
must
not
expect
to
have
every
thing
one
wishes
though
god
is
good
there
are
dreadful
misfortunes
in
the
world
and
i
suppose
we
shall
have
our
share
of
come
charles
though
you
are
but
a
boy
you
are
the
best
boy
in
the
world
you
are
now
almost
my
only
comfort
but
you
will
not
be
able
to
comfort
me
if
you
do
not
take
care
of
dear
mamma
do
you
know
mamma
i
heard
that
naughty
man
below
stairs
count
up
last
night
how
much
rent
you
owed
him
for
and
swear
you
should
not
stay
any
longer
if
you
did
not
pay
him
if
i
were
a
little
bigger
i
would
talk
to
him
so
that
he
should
not
dare
to
insult
us
in
our
distress
but
not
being
big
enough
i
opened
the
door
and
went
into
the
room
and
begged
him
for
god
s
sake
not
to
add
to
your
distress
and
though
he
is
so
ugly
i
took
hold
of
his
hand
and
kissed
it
but
it
felt
like
iron
which
put
me
in
mind
of
his
iron
heart
and
i
cried
ready
to
burst
with
mortification
he
did
not
say
hardly
a
he
must
be
paid
charles
he
shall
be
do
you
know
mamma
as
soon
as
i
left
him
i
went
to
the
bishop
s
gardens
and
spoke
to
the
gardener
i
asked
him
if
he
had
heard
that
my
papa
was
ill
and
he
said
he
had
he
said
too
he
was
very
sorry
and
wanted
to
know
what
hand
we
made
of
it
for
want
of
the
wages
i
told
him
we
were
sadly
off
and
the
man
of
the
house
had
just
been
affronting
me
about
his
rent
but
said
i
can
not
you
give
me
something
to
do
to
weed
or
to
rake
i
can
dig
a
little
too
and
scatter
seed
he
asked
if
i
knew
weeds
from
flowers
oh
that
i
do
said
i
well
then
said
he
there
is
not
much
you
can
do
but
you
are
a
good
boy
and
i
will
put
you
on
the
bishop
s
list
but
now
mamma
i
have
not
the
heart
to
work
till
i
see
whether
papa
will
get
well
while
poor
charles
told
his
artless
tale
marguerite
wept
over
him
and
kissed
him
again
and
again
she
called
him
the
best
child
in
the
world
and
said
that
if
i
were
but
so
fortunate
as
to
recover
with
such
a
husband
and
such
a
son
she
should
yet
be
the
happiest
of
women
oh
my
poor
father
exclaimed
charles
ever
since
the
great
i
have
every
hour
loved
him
better
than
before
i
thought
that
was
impossible
but
he
is
so
gentle
so
kind
so
and
so
patient
i
loved
him
when
he
was
harsh
and
when
he
was
out
of
his
mind
but
nothing
so
well
then
as
i
have
done
since
people
that
are
kind
and
smile
always
do
one
good
but
nobody
s
smiles
are
like
my
father
s
it
makes
me
cry
with
joy
sometimes
when
i
do
but
think
of
them
pray
papa
added
he
coming
up
to
the
bedside
and
whispering
yet
with
a
hurried
and
passionate
accent
get
well
do
but
get
well
and
we
will
be
so
happy
never
was
there
a
family
so
happy
or
so
loving
as
we
will
be
while
he
spoke
thus
i
endeavoured
to
put
out
my
hand
but
i
could
not
i
endeavoured
to
smile
but
i
was
unable
my
heart
was
in
a
feeble
yet
soothing
tranquillity
the
accents
of
love
i
had
heard
dwelt
upon
my
memory
they
had
talked
of
distress
but
the
sentiment
of
love
was
uppermost
in
my
recollection
i
was
too
weak
of
frame
to
suffer
intellectual
distress
no
accents
but
those
which
carried
balm
to
my
spirit
seemed
capable
of
resting
upon
my
ear
from
this
hour
i
regularly
grew
better
and
as
i
recovered
seemed
to
feel
more
and
more
vividly
how
enviable
it
was
to
be
the
head
of
a
loving
and
harmonious
family
my
recovery
however
was
exceedingly
slow
and
it
was
several
weeks
before
i
had
so
far
recruited
my
strength
as
to
be
capable
of
my
ordinary
occupations
in
the
mean
time
the
pecuniary
difficulties
to
which
we
were
exposed
hourly
increased
and
the
cheerful
but
insignificant
labours
of
charles
could
contribute
little
to
the
support
of
a
family
the
melancholy
nature
of
our
situation
might
perhaps
have
been
expected
to
prevent
the
restoration
of
my
health
at
first
however
it
had
not
that
effect
the
debilitated
state
of
my
animal
functions
led
me
by
a
sort
of
irresistible
instinct
to
reject
ideas
and
reflections
which
i
should
then
have
been
unable
to
endure
i
saw
the
anxiety
and
affection
of
my
family
and
i
was
comforted
i
saw
the
smiles
of
marguerite
and
i
seemed
insensible
to
the
languor
the
saddened
cheerfulness
they
expressed
i
did
not
perceive
that
while
i
was
provided
with
every
thing
necessary
in
my
condition
my
family
were
in
want
of
the
very
bread
that
should
sustain
existence
my
health
in
the
mean
time
improved
and
my
perceptions
became
proportionably
clearer
symptoms
of
desolation
and
famine
though
as
much
as
possible
covered
from
my
sight
obtruded
themselves
and
were
remarked
one
day
in
particular
i
observed
various
tokens
of
this
nature
in
silence
and
with
that
sort
of
bewildered
understanding
which
at
once
labours
for
comprehension
and
resists
belief
the
day
closed
and
what
i
had
perceived
pressed
upon
my
mind
and
excluded
sleep
now
for
the
first
time
i
exerted
myself
to
recollect
in
a
methodical
way
the
state
of
my
affairs
for
the
severity
of
my
illness
had
at
length
succeeded
to
banish
from
me
all
ideas
and
feelings
but
what
related
to
the
sensations
it
produced
and
to
the
objects
around
me
and
it
was
not
without
effort
that
i
could
once
more
fully
call
to
mind
the
scenes
in
which
i
had
been
engaged
the
truth
then
by
regular
degrees
rose
completely
to
view
and
i
began
to
be
astonished
that
my
poor
wife
and
children
had
been
able
in
any
manner
to
get
through
the
horrible
evils
to
which
they
must
have
been
exposed
this
thought
i
revolved
in
my
mind
for
near
two
hours
and
the
longer
i
dwelt
upon
it
the
more
perturbed
and
restless
i
grew
at
length
it
became
impossible
for
me
to
hold
my
contemplations
pent
up
in
my
own
bosom
i
turned
to
marguerite
and
asked
her
whether
she
were
asleep
she
answered
in
the
negative
she
had
been
remarking
my
restlessness
and
tenderly
enquired
respecting
its
cause
how
long
said
i
is
it
since
i
was
taken
with
the
fever
a
month
replied
she
it
was
of
the
most
malignant
and
distressing
kind
while
it
lasted
and
i
did
not
expect
you
to
live
but
it
has
left
you
a
fortnight
and
i
hope
reginald
you
find
yourself
getting
strong
and
so
we
are
here
in
constance
and
we
have
left
switzerland
three
months
my
love
i
remember
very
well
the
letter
we
received
from
monsieur
grimseld
has
any
further
intelligence
reached
us
from
that
quarter
none
no
supply
of
any
kind
has
reached
you
my
dear
reginald
talk
of
something
else
you
will
soon
i
hope
be
well
our
children
are
all
alive
and
the
calamity
that
has
not
succeeded
to
separate
us
or
to
diminish
our
circle
of
love
even
by
a
single
member
we
will
learn
to
bear
let
us
fix
our
attention
on
the
better
prospects
that
open
before
us
stay
marguerite
i
have
other
questions
to
ask
before
you
require
me
to
bear
the
calamities
that
have
overtaken
us
let
me
understand
what
these
calamities
are
while
we
waited
for
intelligence
from
switzerland
we
expended
the
whole
sum
that
we
brought
with
us
and
i
was
obliged
to
hire
myself
to
the
episcopal
gardener
for
bread
was
it
not
so
indeed
reginald
you
are
to
blame
pray
question
me
no
further
this
was
our
condition
some
time
ago
and
now
for
a
month
past
i
have
been
incapable
of
labour
marguerite
what
have
you
done
indeed
my
love
i
have
been
too
anxious
for
you
to
think
much
of
any
thing
else
we
had
still
some
things
you
know
that
we
could
contrive
to
do
without
and
those
i
have
sold
charles
too
our
son
has
lately
hired
himself
to
the
gardener
and
has
every
night
brought
us
home
a
little
though
it
was
but
dear
boy
what
children
what
a
wife
have
i
brought
to
destruction
our
rent
too
surely
you
have
not
been
able
to
pay
that
not
entirely
in
part
i
have
been
obliged
to
pay
ah
i
well
remember
how
a
wretch
has
got
the
power
over
us
in
that
respect
he
has
not
turned
us
out
of
doors
he
threatened
hard
several
times
at
last
i
saw
it
was
necessary
to
make
an
effort
and
the
day
before
yesterday
i
paid
him
half
his
demand
if
i
could
have
avoided
that
we
might
have
had
a
supply
of
food
a
little
longer
i
intreated
earnestly
for
a
little
further
indulgence
but
it
was
in
vain
it
went
against
the
pride
and
independence
of
my
soul
to
sue
to
this
man
but
it
was
for
you
and
for
my
children
remorseless
wretch
then
every
petty
resource
we
had
is
gone
indeed
i
do
not
know
that
we
have
any
thing
more
to
sell
i
searched
narrowly
yesterday
but
i
will
examine
again
the
poor
children
must
have
something
to
support
them
and
their
fare
has
of
late
been
dreadfully
their
fare
what
have
they
eaten
bread
nothing
else
for
the
last
fortnight
and
yourself
oh
reginald
it
was
necessary
you
know
that
i
should
keep
myself
alive
but
i
assure
you
i
have
robbed
them
as
little
as
i
horror
horror
marguerite
what
is
it
you
dream
of
i
see
my
wife
and
children
dying
of
hunger
and
you
talk
to
me
of
hope
and
of
prospects
why
has
this
detail
of
miseries
been
concealed
from
me
why
have
i
been
suffered
with
accursed
and
unnatural
appetite
to
feed
on
the
vitals
of
all
i
love
reginald
even
selfishness
itself
would
have
taught
us
that
it
is
to
your
recovery
that
we
look
for
our
future
support
mock
me
not
i
adjure
you
with
senseless
words
you
talk
idly
of
the
future
while
the
tremendous
present
bars
all
prospect
to
that
future
we
are
perishing
by
inches
we
have
no
provision
for
the
coming
day
no
no
something
desperate
something
yet
unthought
of
must
be
attempted
i
will
not
sit
inactive
and
see
my
offspring
around
me
die
in
succession
no
by
heaven
though
i
am
starving
like
ugolino
i
am
not
like
ugolino
shut
up
in
a
dungeon
the
world
is
open
its
scenes
are
wide
the
resources
it
offers
are
to
the
bold
and
despairing
innumerable
i
am
a
father
and
will
show
myself
worthy
of
the
name
reginald
torture
me
not
by
language
like
this
think
what
it
is
to
be
indeed
a
father
and
make
yourself
that
be
careful
of
yourself
complete
your
recovery
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
i
have
conducted
it
thus
far
nor
am
i
yet
without
hope
eight
days
ago
i
applied
to
the
secretary
of
the
palace
representing
your
case
as
a
retainer
of
the
bishop
disabled
by
sickness
and
with
a
family
unprovided
for
till
yesterday
i
got
no
answer
to
my
memorial
and
then
he
informed
me
that
you
had
been
so
short
a
time
in
employ
that
nothing
could
be
done
for
you
but
i
will
throw
myself
at
the
feet
of
the
bishop
himself
who
arrived
last
night
only
from
the
other
side
of
the
every
word
that
marguerite
uttered
went
to
my
heart
it
was
not
long
before
the
dawn
of
the
day
and
the
truths
i
had
heard
were
further
confirmed
to
me
by
the
organ
of
sight
the
sentiments
of
this
night
produced
a
total
revolution
in
me
and
i
was
no
longer
the
feeble
convalescent
that
the
setting
sun
of
the
preceding
day
had
left
me
the
film
was
removed
from
my
eyes
and
i
surveyed
not
the
objects
around
me
with
a
glassy
eye
and
unapprehensive
observation
all
the
powers
i
possessed
were
alert
and
in
motion
to
my
suspicious
and
hurried
gaze
the
apartment
appeared
stripped
of
its
moveables
and
left
naked
a
mansion
in
which
for
despair
to
take
up
his
abode
my
children
approached
me
i
seemed
to
read
the
wan
and
emaciated
traces
of
death
in
their
countenances
this
perhaps
was
in
some
degree
the
painting
of
my
too
conscious
thoughts
but
there
needed
no
exaggeration
to
awaken
torture
in
my
bosom
when
thus
stimulated
i
observed
for
the
first
time
the
dreadful
change
that
had
taken
place
in
marguerite
her
colour
was
gone
her
cheeks
were
sunk
her
eye
had
the
quickness
and
discomposure
expressive
of
debility
i
took
hold
of
her
hand
and
found
it
cold
emaciated
and
white
i
pressed
it
to
my
lips
with
agony
a
tear
unbidden
fell
from
my
eye
and
rested
upon
it
having
finished
my
examination
i
took
my
hat
and
was
hastening
to
escape
into
the
street
marguerite
noted
my
motions
and
anxiously
interposed
to
prevent
my
design
she
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
gently
yet
in
a
manner
full
of
irresistible
expostulation
where
would
you
go
what
have
you
purposed
do
not
oh
do
not
destroy
a
family
to
whom
your
life
your
sobriety
and
prudence
are
indispensable
i
took
her
hand
within
both
mine
compose
yourself
my
love
i
have
been
your
enemy
too
much
already
to
be
capable
now
so
much
as
in
thought
of
adding
to
my
guilt
i
need
an
interval
for
musing
and
determination
i
will
return
in
a
very
short
time
and
you
shall
be
the
confidant
of
my
thoughts
with
wild
and
impatient
spirit
i
repassed
in
idea
the
whole
history
of
my
life
but
principally
i
dwelt
in
recollection
upon
the
marquis
de
damville
that
generous
friend
that
munificent
benefactor
whose
confidence
i
had
so
ill
repaid
damville
exclaimed
i
you
trusted
to
me
your
daughter
the
dearest
thing
you
knew
on
earth
you
believed
that
the
wretch
did
not
live
who
could
be
unjust
to
so
rich
a
pledge
look
down
look
down
o
best
of
men
from
the
heaven
to
which
your
virtues
have
raised
you
and
see
of
how
much
baseness
man
yes
the
man
you
disdained
not
to
call
your
friend
is
capable
but
no
a
sight
like
this
might
well
convert
the
heaven
you
dwell
in
to
hell
you
trusted
her
to
me
i
have
robbed
her
you
enriched
her
mind
with
the
noblest
endowments
i
have
buried
them
in
the
mire
of
the
vilest
condition
all
her
generous
her
unwearied
exertions
are
fruitless
by
my
evil
genius
they
are
blasted
i
have
made
her
a
mother
only
that
she
might
behold
her
children
perishing
with
hunger
they
stretch
out
their
hands
to
me
for
the
smallest
portion
of
that
inheritance
which
i
have
squandered
in
more
than
demoniac
vice
this
this
is
the
fruit
of
my
misdeeds
i
am
now
draining
the
last
dregs
of
that
mischief
of
which
i
have
so
wickedly
so
basely
been
the
author
as
i
returned
i
met
marguerite
who
was
come
from
her
attempt
upon
the
bishop
he
had
received
her
paper
and
delivered
it
to
his
secretary
that
very
secretary
who
had
already
disappointed
all
her
expectations
from
that
quarter
she
had
attempted
to
speak
to
adjure
the
bishop
whatever
he
did
not
to
deliver
her
over
to
a
man
by
whom
her
hopes
had
been
so
cruelly
frustrated
but
the
tumult
of
the
scene
drowned
her
voice
and
the
hurry
and
confusion
overpowered
her
efforts
they
however
drew
such
a
degree
of
attention
on
her
that
in
the
dissentions
which
religious
broils
at
that
time
spread
in
constance
she
was
suspected
of
pressing
thus
earnestly
towards
the
person
of
the
bishop
with
no
good
design
and
in
fine
was
rudely
thrust
out
of
the
palace
she
had
not
recovered
from
the
agitation
into
which
she
had
been
thrown
when
i
met
her
i
eagerly
enquired
into
the
cause
of
her
apparent
distress
but
she
shook
her
head
mournfully
and
was
silent
i
easily
understood
where
she
had
been
and
the
failure
of
her
experiment
all
then
said
i
is
at
an
end
now
marguerite
you
must
give
up
your
experiments
and
leave
to
me
the
cure
of
evils
of
which
i
only
am
the
author
i
will
return
this
instant
to
the
garden
of
the
palace
and
resume
the
situation
i
formerly
for
god
s
sake
reginald
what
is
it
you
mean
you
have
just
acquired
strength
to
seek
the
benefit
of
air
the
least
exertion
fatigues
you
at
this
moment
the
little
walk
you
have
taken
has
covered
you
with
perspiration
you
could
not
dig
or
stoop
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
being
utterly
marguerite
i
will
not
sit
down
tamely
and
see
my
family
expire
in
many
cases
it
is
reasonable
to
bid
a
valetudinarian
take
care
of
himself
but
our
situation
is
beyond
that
i
must
do
something
extraordinary
circumstances
often
bring
along
with
them
extraordinary
strength
no
man
knows
till
the
experiment
what
he
is
capable
of
effecting
i
feel
at
this
moment
no
debility
and
i
doubt
not
that
the
despair
of
my
mind
will
give
redoubled
energy
to
my
while
i
spoke
thus
i
was
conscious
that
i
had
little
more
than
the
strength
of
a
child
but
i
could
not
endure
at
such
a
time
to
remain
in
inactivity
i
felt
as
much
ashamed
of
the
debilitated
state
in
which
my
fever
had
left
me
as
i
could
have
done
of
the
most
inglorious
effeminacy
and
cowardice
of
soul
i
determined
to
relieve
my
family
or
perish
in
the
attempt
if
all
my
efforts
were
vain
i
could
not
better
finish
my
career
than
exhausted
sinking
expiring
under
a
last
exertion
to
discharge
the
duties
of
my
station
we
returned
into
the
house
marguerite
took
from
a
closet
the
last
remnant
of
provisions
we
had
the
purchase
of
poor
charles
s
labour
of
the
preceding
day
there
was
a
general
contest
who
should
escape
from
receiving
any
part
in
the
distribution
charles
had
withdrawn
himself
and
was
not
to
be
found
julia
endeavoured
to
abscond
but
was
stopped
by
louisa
and
her
mother
she
had
wept
so
much
that
inanition
seemed
more
dangerous
for
her
than
perhaps
for
any
other
of
the
circle
no
one
can
conceive
who
has
not
felt
it
how
affecting
a
contest
of
this
kind
must
appear
to
me
sensible
as
i
was
to
the
danger
that
their
virtue
and
generous
affection
were
the
prelude
only
to
their
common
destruction
i
said
there
was
a
general
contest
who
should
avoid
all
share
in
the
distribution
but
i
recollect
that
the
little
marguerite
two
years
and
a
half
old
exclaimed
at
first
i
am
so
hungry
mamma
but
watching
as
she
carefully
did
every
thing
that
passed
she
presently
laid
down
her
bread
upon
the
table
in
silence
and
almost
untouched
and
being
asked
why
she
did
so
she
replied
in
a
tone
of
speaking
sensibility
thank
you
i
am
not
hungry
now
this
scene
made
an
impression
on
my
mind
never
to
be
forgotten
it
blasted
and
corrupted
all
the
pulses
of
my
soul
a
little
before
i
had
reconciled
myself
to
poverty
i
had
even
brought
myself
to
regard
it
with
cheerfulness
but
the
sentiment
was
now
reversed
i
could
endure
it
i
could
steel
myself
against
its
attacks
but
never
from
this
hour
in
the
wildest
paroxysms
of
enthusiasm
has
it
been
the
topic
of
my
exultation
or
my
panegyric
no
change
of
circumstances
no
inundation
of
wealth
has
had
the
power
to
obliterate
from
my
recollection
what
i
then
saw
a
family
perishing
with
hunger
all
that
is
dearest
to
you
in
the
world
sinking
under
the
most
dreadful
of
all
the
scourges
with
which
this
sublunary
scene
is
ever
afflicted
no
help
near
no
prospect
but
of
still
accumulating
distress
a
death
the
slowest
yet
the
most
certain
and
the
most
agonising
that
can
befall
us
no
there
is
nothing
that
has
power
to
rend
all
the
strings
of
the
heart
like
this
from
this
moment
the
whole
set
of
my
feelings
was
changed
avarice
descended
and
took
possession
of
my
soul
haunted
as
i
perpetually
was
by
images
of
the
plague
of
famine
nothing
appeared
to
me
so
valuable
as
wealth
nothing
so
desirable
as
to
be
placed
at
the
utmost
possible
distance
from
want
an
appetite
of
this
kind
is
insatiable
no
distance
seems
sufficiently
great
no
obstacles
mountains
on
mountains
of
gold
appear
an
inadequate
security
to
bar
from
us
the
approach
of
the
monster
we
dread
while
i
speak
of
the
sentiments
which
in
the
sequel
were
generated
in
my
mind
by
what
i
now
saw
i
am
suspending
my
narrative
in
a
crisis
at
which
a
family
interesting
amiable
and
virtuous
is
reduced
to
the
lowest
state
of
humiliation
and
distress
they
are
moments
like
these
that
harden
the
human
heart
and
fill
us
with
inextinguishable
hatred
and
contempt
for
our
species
they
tear
off
the
trappings
and
decoration
of
polished
society
and
show
it
in
all
its
hideousness
the
wanton
eye
of
pampered
pride
pleases
itself
with
the
spectacle
of
cities
and
palaces
the
stately
column
and
the
swelling
arch
it
observes
at
hand
the
busy
scene
where
all
are
occupied
in
the
various
pursuits
of
pleasure
or
industry
and
admires
the
concert
the
confederacy
by
means
of
which
each
after
his
mode
is
unconsciously
promoting
the
objects
of
others
cheated
by
the
outside
of
things
we
denominate
this
a
vast
combination
for
general
benefit
the
poor
and
the
famished
man
contemplates
the
scene
with
other
thoughts
unbribed
to
admire
and
applaud
he
sees
in
it
a
confederacy
of
hostility
and
general
oppression
he
sees
every
man
pursuing
his
selfish
ends
regardless
of
the
wants
of
others
he
sees
himself
contemptuously
driven
from
the
circle
where
the
rest
of
his
are
busily
and
profitably
engaged
he
lives
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
without
one
friend
to
feel
an
interest
in
his
welfare
he
lives
in
the
midst
of
plenty
from
the
participation
of
which
he
is
driven
by
brutal
menaces
and
violence
no
man
who
has
not
been
placed
in
his
situation
can
imagine
the
sensations
with
which
overwhelmed
as
he
is
with
domestic
ruin
and
despair
he
beholds
the
riot
the
prodigality
the
idiot
ostentation
the
senseless
expense
with
which
he
is
surrounded
on
every
side
what
were
we
to
do
were
we
to
beg
along
the
streets
were
we
to
in
treat
for
wretched
offals
at
rich
men
s
doors
alas
this
it
was
to
be
feared
even
if
we
stooped
to
the
miserable
attempt
instead
of
satisfying
wants
for
ever
new
would
only
prolong
in
the
bitterness
of
anguish
the
fate
for
which
we
were
reserved
an
unexpected
relief
at
this
time
presented
itself
while
the
scanty
meal
i
have
mentioned
was
yet
unfinished
a
letter
was
presented
me
inclosing
under
its
cover
a
bill
of
one
hundred
crowns
the
letter
was
from
bernardin
the
faithful
servant
whom
we
found
it
necessary
to
dismiss
three
months
before
when
we
quitted
our
residence
in
switzerland
it
informed
us
that
as
soon
as
he
had
parted
from
us
he
had
set
out
on
his
return
to
his
native
town
next
adjacent
to
my
paternal
residence
that
he
found
his
father
had
died
a
short
time
before
and
that
from
the
sale
of
his
effects
he
had
reaped
an
inheritance
to
triple
the
amount
of
the
sum
he
had
now
forwarded
to
us
he
had
heard
by
accident
of
the
death
of
our
friend
in
switzerland
and
the
character
of
his
successor
and
dreaded
that
the
consequences
might
prove
highly
injurious
to
us
he
had
still
some
business
to
settle
with
the
surviving
branches
of
his
family
but
that
would
be
over
in
a
few
weeks
and
then
if
we
would
allow
him
he
would
return
to
his
dear
master
and
afford
us
every
assistance
in
his
power
the
little
property
that
had
now
fallen
to
him
would
prevent
him
from
being
a
burthen
and
he
would
hire
a
spot
of
land
and
remain
near
us
if
we
refused
him
the
consolation
of
returning
to
his
former
employment
what
a
reproach
was
it
to
me
that
descended
from
one
of
the
most
illustrious
families
in
europe
the
heir
of
an
ample
patrimony
and
receiving
a
still
larger
fortune
in
marriage
i
should
by
the
total
neglect
and
profligate
defiance
of
the
duties
incumbent
on
me
have
reduced
myself
so
low
as
to
be
indebted
to
a
peasant
and
a
menial
for
the
means
of
saving
my
family
from
instant
destruction
this
was
a
deep
and
fatal
wound
to
the
pride
of
my
soul
there
was
however
no
alternative
no
possibility
of
rejecting
the
supply
afforded
us
at
so
eventful
a
moment
we
determined
to
use
it
for
the
present
and
to
repay
it
with
the
earliest
opportunity
and
in
the
following
week
in
spite
of
the
remonstrances
of
marguerite
the
yet
feeble
state
of
my
health
and
the
penalties
annexed
to
the
proceeding
i
set
off
for
the
canton
of
soleure
determined
if
possible
to
wrest
the
little
staff
of
my
family
from
the
hand
that
so
basely
detained
it
i
passed
through
zurich
and
a
part
of
the
canton
of
basle
without
obstacle
these
parts
of
switzerland
had
not
suffered
from
the
calamity
which
had
occasioned
our
exile
in
proceeding
further
i
found
it
necessary
to
assume
a
disguise
and
to
avoid
large
towns
and
frequented
roads
i
reached
at
length
the
well
known
scene
in
which
i
had
so
lately
consumed
twelve
months
of
my
life
in
which
i
first
began
to
breathe
to
breathe
not
to
be
refreshed
from
ruin
beggary
and
exile
there
was
no
pleasing
recollection
annexed
to
this
spot
it
was
a
remembrancer
of
shame
sorrow
and
remorse
yet
such
is
the
power
of
objects
once
familiar
revisited
after
absence
that
my
eye
ran
over
them
with
delight
i
felt
lightened
from
the
weariness
of
the
journey
and
found
that
the
recollection
of
pains
past
over
and
subdued
was
capable
of
being
made
a
source
of
gratification
the
mountains
among
which
i
had
wandered
and
consumed
as
it
were
the
last
dregs
of
my
insanity
surrounded
me
the
path
in
which
i
was
travelling
led
along
one
of
their
ridges
i
had
performed
this
part
of
my
journey
by
night
and
the
first
gleams
of
day
now
began
to
streak
the
horizon
i
looked
towards
the
cottage
the
distant
view
of
which
had
so
often
in
moments
of
the
deepest
despair
awakened
in
my
heart
the
soothings
of
sympathy
and
affection
i
saw
that
as
yet
it
remained
in
its
forlorn
condition
and
had
undergone
no
repair
while
the
lands
around
which
had
lately
experienced
the
superintendence
of
marguerite
had
met
with
more
attention
and
began
to
resume
the
marks
of
culture
i
sighed
for
the
return
of
those
days
and
that
situation
which
while
present
to
me
had
passed
unheeded
and
unenjoyed
i
repaired
to
the
house
of
my
late
protector
now
the
residence
of
monsieur
grimseld
he
was
a
meagre
shrivelled
figure
and
though
scarcely
arrived
at
the
middle
of
human
life
exhibited
all
the
marks
of
a
premature
old
age
i
disclosed
myself
to
him
and
began
warmly
to
expostulate
with
him
upon
the
profligacy
of
his
conduct
he
changed
colour
and
betrayed
symptoms
of
confusion
the
moment
i
announced
myself
while
i
pressed
him
with
the
barbarity
of
his
conduct
the
dreadful
effects
it
had
already
produced
and
the
incontestible
justice
of
my
claim
he
stammered
and
began
to
propose
terms
of
accommodation
during
this
conversation
we
were
alone
after
some
time
however
a
servant
entered
the
room
and
the
countenance
of
the
master
assumed
an
expression
of
satisfaction
and
confidence
he
eagerly
seized
on
the
occasion
which
presented
itself
and
instantly
changing
his
tone
called
on
his
servant
to
assist
him
in
securing
a
criminal
against
the
state
i
at
first
resisted
but
grimseld
perceiving
this
applied
to
his
bell
with
great
vehemence
and
three
other
servants
made
their
appearance
whose
employment
was
in
the
field
but
who
had
now
accidentally
come
into
the
house
for
refreshment
i
had
arms
but
i
found
it
impracticable
to
effect
my
escape
and
i
soon
felt
that
by
yielding
to
the
impulse
of
indignation
and
punishing
grimseld
on
the
spot
for
his
perfidy
i
might
ruin
but
could
not
forward
the
affair
in
which
i
was
engaged
i
was
conducted
to
prison
and
the
thoughts
produced
in
me
by
this
sudden
reverse
were
extremely
melancholy
and
discouraging
grimseld
was
a
man
of
opulence
and
power
i
was
without
friends
or
the
means
of
procuring
friends
the
law
expressly
condemned
my
return
and
what
had
i
not
to
fear
from
law
when
abetted
and
inforced
by
the
hand
of
power
i
might
be
imprisoned
for
ten
years
i
might
be
imprisoned
for
life
i
began
earnestly
to
wish
that
i
had
remained
with
my
family
and
given
up
at
least
all
present
hopes
of
redress
it
would
be
a
dreadful
accumulation
of
all
my
calamities
if
now
at
last
i
and
my
children
were
destined
to
suffer
perhaps
to
perish
in
a
state
of
separation
and
the
last
consolations
of
the
wretched
those
of
suffering
sympathising
and
condoling
with
each
other
were
denied
us
full
of
these
tragical
forebodings
i
threw
myself
at
first
on
the
floor
of
my
cell
in
a
state
little
short
of
the
most
absolute
despair
i
exclaimed
upon
my
adverse
fortune
which
was
never
weary
of
persecuting
me
i
apostrophised
with
tender
and
distracted
accents
my
wife
and
children
from
whom
i
now
seemed
to
be
cut
off
by
an
everlasting
divorce
i
called
upon
death
to
put
an
end
to
these
tumults
and
emotions
of
the
soul
which
were
no
longer
to
be
borne
in
a
short
time
however
i
recovered
myself
procured
the
implements
of
writing
and
drew
up
in
the
strong
and
impressive
language
of
truth
a
memorial
to
the
council
of
the
state
i
was
next
to
consider
how
this
was
to
reach
its
destination
for
there
was
some
danger
that
it
might
be
intercepted
by
the
vigilance
and
malignity
of
my
adversary
i
desired
to
speak
with
the
keeper
of
the
prison
he
had
some
recollection
of
me
and
a
still
more
distinct
one
of
my
family
he
concurred
with
the
general
sentiment
in
a
strong
aversion
to
the
character
of
grimseld
as
i
pressed
upon
him
the
hardship
of
my
case
and
the
fatal
consequences
with
which
it
might
be
attended
i
could
perceive
that
he
fully
entered
into
the
feeling
with
which
i
wished
him
to
be
impressed
he
blamed
my
rashness
in
returning
to
switzerland
in
defiance
of
the
positive
prohibition
that
had
been
issued
but
promised
at
all
events
that
my
paper
should
be
delivered
to
the
president
morning
i
remained
three
days
without
an
answer
and
these
days
were
to
me
an
eternity
i
anticipated
every
kind
of
misfortune
i
believed
that
law
and
malice
had
succeeded
to
the
subversion
of
equity
at
length
however
i
was
delivered
from
my
apprehensions
and
perplexity
and
summoned
to
appear
before
the
council
it
was
well
for
me
perhaps
that
i
had
to
do
with
a
government
so
simple
and
moderate
as
that
of
switzerland
i
obtained
redress
it
was
referred
to
an
arbitration
of
neighbours
to
set
a
fair
price
on
my
property
and
then
decreed
that
if
monsieur
grimseld
refused
the
purchase
the
sum
should
be
paid
me
out
of
the
coffers
of
the
state
he
was
also
condemned
in
a
certain
fine
for
the
fraud
he
had
attempted
to
commit
the
affair
thus
put
in
train
was
soon
completed
and
i
returned
with
joy
having
effected
the
object
of
my
journey
to
my
anxious
and
expecting
family
soon
after
we
removed
to
the
spot
we
had
chosen
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
lake
where
we
remained
for
the
six
following
years
in
a
state
of
peace
and
tranquillity
chapter
xi
it
was
in
the
evening
of
a
summer
s
day
in
the
latter
end
of
the
year
fifteen
hundred
and
that
a
stranger
arrived
at
my
habitation
he
was
feeble
emaciated
and
pale
his
forehead
full
of
wrinkles
and
his
hair
and
beard
as
white
as
snow
care
was
written
in
his
face
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
he
had
suffered
much
from
distress
of
mind
yet
his
eye
was
still
quick
and
lively
with
a
strong
expression
of
suspiciousness
and
anxiety
his
garb
which
externally
consisted
of
nothing
more
than
a
robe
of
russet
brown
with
a
girdle
of
the
same
was
coarse
threadbare
and
ragged
he
supported
his
tottering
steps
with
a
staff
and
having
lost
his
foreteeth
his
speech
was
indistinct
and
difficult
to
be
comprehended
his
wretched
appearance
excited
my
compassion
at
the
same
time
that
i
could
easily
discern
beneath
all
its
disadvantages
that
he
was
no
common
beggar
or
rustic
ruined
and
squalid
as
he
appeared
i
thought
i
could
perceive
traces
in
his
countenance
of
what
had
formerly
been
daring
enterprise
profound
meditation
and
generous
humanity
i
saw
that
he
was
much
fatigued
and
i
invited
him
to
rest
himself
upon
the
bench
before
the
door
i
set
before
him
bread
and
wine
and
he
partook
of
both
i
asked
him
his
name
and
his
country
he
told
me
that
he
was
a
venetian
and
that
his
name
as
nearly
as
i
could
collect
was
signor
francesco
zampieri
he
seemed
however
averse
to
speaking
and
he
requested
me
to
suffer
him
to
pass
the
night
in
my
habitation
there
was
nothing
singular
in
the
request
a
hospitality
of
this
sort
being
the
practice
of
the
neighbourhood
and
humanity
would
have
prompted
my
compliance
if
i
had
not
been
still
more
strongly
urged
by
an
undefinable
curiosity
that
began
to
spring
up
in
my
bosom
i
prepared
for
him
a
in
a
at
the
end
of
my
garden
as
soon
as
it
was
ready
he
desired
to
be
left
alone
that
he
might
seek
in
rest
some
relief
from
the
fatigue
he
had
undergone
he
retired
early
and
therefore
soon
after
daybreak
the
next
morning
i
waited
on
him
to
enquire
how
he
had
rested
he
led
me
out
into
the
fields
the
morning
was
genial
and
exhilarating
we
proceeded
till
we
came
to
a
retired
spot
which
had
frequently
been
the
scene
of
my
solitary
meditations
and
there
seated
ourselves
upon
a
bank
we
had
been
mutually
silent
during
the
walk
as
soon
as
we
were
seated
the
stranger
began
you
are
i
understand
a
frenchman
and
your
name
the
count
de
leon
i
bowed
assent
st
leon
said
he
there
is
something
in
your
countenance
and
manner
that
prepossesses
me
in
your
favour
the
only
thing
i
have
left
to
do
in
the
world
is
to
die
and
what
i
seek
at
present
is
a
friend
who
will
take
care
that
i
shall
be
suffered
to
die
in
peace
shall
i
trust
you
will
you
be
that
friend
to
me
i
was
astonished
at
this
way
of
commencing
his
confidence
in
me
but
i
did
not
hesitate
to
promise
that
he
should
not
find
me
deficient
in
any
thing
that
became
a
man
of
humanity
and
honour
you
do
not
i
think
live
alone
you
have
a
wife
and
i
yet
none
of
them
were
at
home
when
i
arrived
last
night
you
brought
yourself
to
the
every
thing
that
was
necessary
for
my
i
did
so
but
i
have
a
wife
to
whom
i
have
been
married
seventeen
years
and
with
whom
i
have
no
reserves
i
told
her
of
your
arrival
i
spoke
of
your
appearance
i
mentioned
your
it
is
no
matter
she
has
not
seen
me
my
name
is
not
zampieri
i
am
no
who
are
you
then
that
you
shall
never
know
it
makes
no
part
of
the
confidence
i
design
to
repose
in
you
my
name
shall
be
buried
with
me
in
the
grave
nor
shall
any
one
who
has
hitherto
known
me
know
how
at
what
time
or
on
what
spot
of
earth
i
shall
terminate
my
existence
the
cloud
of
oblivion
shall
shelter
me
from
all
human
curiosity
what
i
require
of
you
is
that
you
pledge
your
honour
and
the
faith
of
a
man
that
you
will
never
reveal
to
your
wife
your
children
or
any
human
being
what
you
may
hereafter
know
of
me
and
that
no
particular
that
relates
to
my
history
shall
be
disclosed
till
at
least
one
hundred
years
after
my
upon
these
conditions
i
am
sorry
that
i
must
decline
your
confidence
my
wife
is
a
part
of
myself
for
the
last
six
years
at
least
i
have
had
no
thought
in
which
she
has
not
participated
and
these
have
been
the
most
tranquil
and
happy
years
of
my
life
my
heart
was
formed
by
nature
for
social
ties
habit
has
confirmed
their
propensity
and
i
will
not
now
consent
to
any
thing
that
shall
infringe
on
the
happiness
of
my
while
i
spoke
i
could
perceive
that
my
companion
grew
disturbed
and
angry
at
length
turning
towards
me
a
look
of
ineffable
contempt
he
replied
feeble
and
effeminate
mortal
you
are
neither
a
knight
nor
a
frenchman
or
rather
having
been
both
you
have
forgotten
in
inglorious
obscurity
every
thing
worthy
of
either
was
ever
gallant
action
achieved
by
him
who
was
incapable
of
separating
himself
from
a
woman
was
ever
a
great
discovery
prosecuted
or
an
important
benefit
conferred
upon
the
human
race
by
him
who
was
incapable
of
standing
and
thinking
and
feeling
alone
under
the
usurping
and
dishonoured
name
of
virtue
you
have
sunk
into
a
slavery
baser
than
that
of
the
enchantress
alcina
in
vain
might
honour
worth
and
immortal
renown
proffer
their
favours
to
him
who
has
made
himself
the
basest
of
all
sublunary
things
the
puppet
of
a
woman
the
plaything
of
her
pleasure
wasting
an
inglorious
life
in
the
gratification
of
her
wishes
and
the
performance
of
her
commands
i
felt
that
i
was
not
wholly
unmoved
at
this
expostulation
the
stranger
touched
upon
the
first
and
foremost
passions
of
my
soul
passions
the
operation
of
which
had
long
been
suspended
but
which
were
by
no
means
extinguished
in
my
bosom
he
proceeded
but
it
is
well
years
have
passed
over
my
head
in
vain
and
i
have
not
learnt
to
distinguish
a
man
of
honour
from
a
slave
this
is
only
one
additional
sorrow
to
those
in
which
my
life
has
been
spent
i
have
wandered
through
every
region
of
the
earth
and
have
found
only
disappointment
i
have
entered
the
courts
of
princes
i
have
accompanied
the
march
of
armies
i
have
pined
in
the
putridity
of
dungeons
i
have
tasted
every
vicissitude
of
splendour
and
meanness
five
times
have
i
been
led
to
the
scaffold
and
with
difficulty
escaped
a
public
execution
hated
by
mankind
hunted
from
the
face
of
the
earth
pursued
by
every
atrocious
calumny
without
a
country
without
a
roof
without
a
friend
the
addition
that
can
be
made
to
such
misfortunes
scarcely
deserves
a
while
he
spoke
curiosity
resistless
curiosity
presented
itself
as
a
new
motive
in
aid
of
the
sense
of
shame
which
the
stranger
had
just
before
kindled
in
my
bosom
his
manner
was
inconceivably
impressive
his
voice
though
inarticulate
from
age
had
an
irresistible
melody
and
volume
of
sound
which
awed
while
it
won
the
heart
his
front
appeared
open
large
and
commanding
and
though
he
complained
his
complaints
seemed
to
be
those
of
conscious
dignity
and
innocence
he
went
on
farewell
leon
i
go
and
you
shall
see
me
and
hear
of
me
no
more
you
will
repent
when
it
is
too
late
the
folly
of
this
day
s
determination
i
appear
mean
and
insignificant
in
your
eyes
you
think
my
secrets
beneath
your
curiosity
and
my
benefits
not
worth
your
acceptance
know
that
my
benefits
are
such
as
kings
would
barter
their
thrones
to
purchase
and
that
my
wealth
exceeds
the
wealth
of
empires
you
are
degraded
from
the
rank
you
once
held
among
mankind
your
children
are
destined
to
live
in
the
inglorious
condition
of
peasants
this
day
you
might
have
redeemed
all
your
misfortunes
and
raised
yourself
to
a
station
more
illustrious
than
that
to
which
you
were
born
farewell
destiny
has
marked
out
you
and
yours
for
obscurity
and
oblivion
and
you
do
well
to
reject
magnificence
and
distinction
when
they
proffer
themselves
for
your
stop
cried
i
mysterious
stranger
grant
me
a
moment
s
leisure
to
reflect
and
he
had
risen
to
depart
with
a
gesture
of
resolution
and
contempt
at
my
exclamation
he
paused
and
again
turned
himself
towards
me
my
soul
was
in
tumults
answer
me
most
ambiguous
and
impenetrable
of
mortals
what
is
thy
story
and
what
the
secrets
the
disclosure
of
which
is
pregnant
with
consequences
so
extraordinary
do
you
recollect
the
conditions
upon
which
only
the
disclosure
can
be
made
what
can
i
say
shall
i
determine
to
part
with
that
which
for
years
has
constituted
the
only
consolation
of
my
life
shall
i
suppress
the
curiosity
which
now
torments
me
and
reject
the
boon
you
pretend
to
have
the
power
to
confer
i
grant
you
the
interval
for
reflection
you
demand
i
refuse
to
place
further
confidence
in
you
till
you
have
maturely
examined
yourself
and
roused
all
the
energies
of
your
spirit
to
encounter
the
task
you
one
word
more
you
know
not
indeed
you
know
not
what
a
woman
you
exclude
from
your
confidence
she
is
more
worthy
of
it
than
i
am
referring
to
my
own
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
world
i
can
safely
pronounce
her
the
first
of
her
sex
perhaps
the
first
of
human
beings
indulge
me
in
this
include
her
in
your
confidence
and
i
am
be
silent
i
have
made
my
determination
do
you
make
yours
know
i
would
not
if
i
could
and
can
not
if
i
would
repose
the
secrets
that
press
upon
me
in
more
than
a
single
bosom
it
was
upon
this
condition
i
received
the
communication
upon
this
condition
only
can
i
impart
it
i
am
resolved
to
die
is
the
election
of
my
soul
a
consummation
for
which
i
impatiently
wait
having
determined
therefore
to
withdraw
myself
from
the
powers
committed
to
me
i
am
at
liberty
to
impart
them
upon
the
same
condition
and
no
other
you
may
one
day
if
you
desire
it
seek
the
relief
of
having
thus
spoken
the
stranger
rose
from
his
seat
it
was
yet
early
morning
nor
was
it
likely
we
should
meet
any
one
in
our
walk
he
however
employed
the
precaution
of
causing
me
to
explore
the
path
and
to
see
that
we
should
return
uninterrupted
we
came
back
to
the
the
were
still
closed
the
stranger
determined
they
should
remain
so
when
i
had
come
to
him
as
soon
as
i
rose
i
had
found
the
door
secured
nor
had
he
admitted
me
till
he
recognised
my
voice
and
had
ascertained
that
i
was
alone
these
precautions
scarcely
excited
my
attention
at
the
time
but
after
the
conversation
that
had
just
passed
they
returned
distinctly
to
my
memory
the
remainder
of
the
day
which
had
been
opened
by
this
extraordinary
scene
was
passed
by
me
in
great
anxiety
i
ruminated
with
unceasing
wonder
and
perturbation
upon
the
words
of
the
stranger
shall
i
shut
upon
myself
the
gate
of
knowledge
and
information
is
it
not
the
part
of
a
feeble
and
effeminate
mind
to
refuse
instruction
because
he
is
not
at
liberty
to
communicate
that
instruction
to
another
to
a
wife
the
stranger
professes
to
be
able
to
raise
me
to
the
utmost
height
of
wealth
and
distinction
shall
i
refuse
the
gift
which
in
a
former
instance
i
forfeited
but
for
which
though
contemplated
as
at
an
impracticable
distance
my
whole
soul
longs
if
there
is
any
thing
dishonourable
connected
with
the
participation
of
this
wealth
i
shall
still
be
at
liberty
to
refuse
it
there
can
be
no
crime
in
hearing
what
this
man
has
to
communicate
i
shall
still
and
always
be
master
of
myself
nor
can
i
have
any
thing
personally
to
fear
from
a
man
so
feeble
so
decrepit
so
emaciated
yet
what
can
be
the
gifts
worthy
of
acceptance
of
a
man
who
while
he
possesses
them
is
tired
of
life
and
desires
to
die
or
what
the
wealth
of
him
who
bears
about
him
every
external
symptom
of
poverty
and
desolation
the
conversation
i
had
just
held
revived
in
my
mind
the
true
feeling
of
my
present
situation
the
wounds
of
my
soul
had
been
lulled
into
temporary
insensibility
but
they
were
in
a
state
in
which
the
slightest
accident
was
capable
of
making
them
bleed
afresh
and
with
all
their
former
violence
i
had
rather
steeled
my
mind
to
endure
what
seemed
unavoidable
than
reconciled
myself
to
my
fate
the
youthful
passions
of
my
soul
which
my
early
years
had
written
there
in
characters
so
deep
were
by
no
means
effaced
i
could
not
contemplate
the
splendour
of
rank
with
an
impartial
eye
i
could
not
think
of
the
alternative
of
distinction
or
obscurity
for
my
children
with
indifference
but
most
of
all
the
moment
i
had
experienced
for
them
of
hunger
and
impending
destruction
by
famine
had
produced
an
indelible
impression
it
had
destroyed
all
romance
i
had
almost
said
all
dignity
in
my
mind
for
ever
it
had
snapped
as
by
the
touch
of
a
iron
all
the
finer
and
more
etherialised
sinews
of
my
frame
it
had
planted
the
sordid
love
of
gold
in
my
heart
there
by
its
baneful
vegetation
to
poison
every
nobler
and
more
salubrious
feeling
when
i
returned
to
the
house
marguerite
enquired
of
me
respecting
the
stranger
but
my
answers
were
short
and
embarrassed
she
seemed
to
wonder
that
he
did
not
come
into
the
house
and
partake
of
some
refreshment
in
the
midst
of
my
family
she
asked
whether
he
were
indisposed
and
whether
he
did
not
stand
in
need
of
some
assistance
that
she
might
afford
him
perceiving
however
that
i
was
desirous
of
saying
as
little
as
possible
respecting
him
she
presently
became
silent
i
could
see
that
she
was
hurt
at
my
incommunicativeness
yet
i
could
not
prevail
upon
myself
to
enter
into
an
explanation
of
the
causes
of
my
taciturnity
ours
was
a
family
of
love
and
i
could
observe
that
the
children
sympathised
with
their
mother
and
secretly
were
surprised
at
and
lamented
my
reserve
there
would
have
been
little
in
this
in
perhaps
any
other
family
than
ours
but
the
last
six
years
had
been
spent
by
us
in
such
primeval
simplicity
that
scarcely
one
of
us
had
a
thought
but
what
was
known
to
the
rest
marguerite
cherished
my
frankness
and
unreserve
with
peculiar
zeal
she
remembered
with
bitterness
of
soul
the
periods
in
which
i
fostered
conceptions
only
proper
to
myself
periods
of
dreadful
calamity
or
of
rooted
melancholy
and
sadness
she
could
not
help
regarding
the
silence
into
which
for
the
present
occasion
i
relapsed
as
a
portent
of
evil
augury
charles
who
was
now
sixteen
years
of
age
recollected
the
period
of
our
ruined
fortunes
when
he
had
been
alone
with
me
at
paris
and
partook
of
his
mother
s
feelings
a
trifling
circumstance
at
this
time
occasioned
by
the
little
marguerite
now
eight
years
of
age
rendered
the
restraint
under
which
i
laboured
more
memorable
and
striking
she
had
left
a
little
book
of
fairy
tales
in
which
she
had
been
reading
the
day
before
in
the
at
first
she
did
not
recollect
what
was
become
of
it
and
employed
herself
in
searching
for
it
with
great
assiduity
of
a
sudden
however
she
remembered
where
she
had
read
in
it
last
and
exclaiming
with
exultation
it
is
in
the
sprang
forward
to
fetch
it
i
detained
her
and
told
her
there
was
a
sick
gentleman
there
that
she
would
disturb
then
dear
julia
rejoined
she
be
so
good
as
to
get
it
for
me
you
are
so
quiet
and
careful
you
never
disturb
any
my
love
answered
i
nobody
must
get
it
for
you
the
gentleman
chooses
to
be
alone
and
will
not
let
any
body
come
to
him
you
shall
have
it
after
ah
but
papa
i
want
it
now
i
put
it
away
just
where
the
naughty
giant
had
shut
up
the
gentleman
in
the
dungeon
who
came
to
take
away
the
lady
i
was
obliged
to
put
it
away
then
because
mamma
called
me
to
go
to
bed
but
i
want
so
to
know
what
will
become
of
them
you
can
not
well
dear
marguerite
i
am
sorry
you
must
wait
but
you
must
learn
to
have
do
you
know
papa
i
walked
in
the
garden
before
breakfast
and
so
not
thinking
of
any
thing
i
came
to
the
and
i
tried
to
open
the
door
but
i
could
not
i
found
it
was
locked
so
i
thought
julia
was
there
and
i
knocked
and
called
julia
but
nobody
answered
so
then
i
knew
julia
was
not
there
for
i
was
sure
she
would
have
opened
the
door
so
i
climbed
upon
the
stump
of
the
and
tried
to
look
in
at
the
window
but
the
shutters
were
shut
and
i
could
not
get
to
see
over
the
top
of
them
and
i
walked
all
round
the
and
all
the
shutters
were
shut
papa
i
wish
you
would
not
let
a
man
get
into
the
who
shuts
all
the
shutters
and
locks
the
door
you
always
used
to
let
me
go
into
every
room
i
liked
and
do
you
know
i
think
none
but
bad
people
lock
and
bolt
themselves
up
so
it
puts
mind
of
the
giants
with
their
drawbridges
and
their
pitfalls
i
shall
be
quite
afraid
of
this
frightful
old
this
prattle
of
the
child
was
nothing
yet
it
increased
the
embarrassment
of
my
situation
and
made
the
peculiarity
of
the
case
more
conspicuous
finding
her
pertinacious
in
insisting
upon
a
topic
that
was
disagreeable
to
me
her
mother
called
her
from
me
and
put
her
upon
some
occupation
that
served
to
divert
her
attention
i
felt
like
a
person
that
was
guilty
of
some
crime
and
this
consideration
and
kindness
of
my
wife
when
i
seemed
to
myself
to
deserve
her
reproach
had
not
the
power
to
calm
my
uneasiness
these
little
occurrences
appeared
like
the
beginning
of
a
separation
of
interests
and
estrangement
of
hearts
i
tasked
myself
severely
i
summoned
the
whole
force
of
my
mind
that
i
might
strictly
consider
what
it
was
in
which
i
was
about
to
engage
if
this
slight
and
casual
hint
of
a
secret
is
felt
by
both
marguerite
and
myself
with
so
much
uneasiness
and
embarrassment
what
will
be
our
situation
if
i
go
on
to
accept
the
stranger
s
confidence
and
become
the
depository
of
an
arcanum
so
important
as
he
represents
his
to
be
he
declares
himself
able
to
bestow
upon
me
the
highest
opulence
what
will
be
the
feelings
of
my
wife
and
children
when
they
see
my
condition
suddenly
changed
from
its
present
humble
appearance
to
splendour
and
wealth
without
being
able
to
assign
the
source
of
this
extraordinary
accession
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
a
family
picture
more
enviable
that
than
to
which
i
was
now
continually
present
and
of
which
i
formed
a
part
we
had
been
happy
on
the
banks
of
the
garonne
and
we
had
pictured
to
ourselves
a
plan
of
happiness
immediately
on
our
arrival
in
the
city
of
constance
but
these
were
little
and
imperfect
compared
with
what
i
now
enjoyed
in
the
first
situation
my
children
were
infants
and
in
the
second
the
eldest
was
but
ten
years
of
age
the
mother
was
now
and
she
had
lost
in
my
eyes
at
least
none
of
her
personal
attractions
her
intellectual
accomplishments
were
much
greater
than
ever
her
understanding
was
matured
her
judgment
decided
her
experience
more
comprehensive
as
she
had
a
greater
compass
of
materials
to
work
upon
her
fancy
was
more
playful
her
conversation
richer
and
her
reflections
more
amusing
and
profound
the
matron
character
she
had
acquired
had
had
no
other
effect
on
her
feelings
than
to
render
them
more
deep
more
true
and
magnetical
her
disposition
was
more
entirely
affectionate
than
it
had
been
even
in
the
first
year
of
our
cohabitation
her
attachment
to
her
children
was
exemplary
and
her
vigilance
uninterrupted
and
for
myself
she
was
accustomed
in
all
that
related
to
our
mutual
love
to
enter
into
my
sentiments
and
inclinations
with
so
just
a
tone
of
equality
and
kindness
that
we
seemed
to
be
two
bodies
animated
by
a
single
soul
if
the
mother
were
improved
the
children
were
still
more
improved
in
their
early
years
we
are
attached
to
our
offspring
merely
because
they
are
ours
and
in
a
way
that
has
led
superficial
speculators
to
consider
the
attachment
less
as
the
necessary
operation
of
a
sensible
and
conscious
mind
than
as
a
wise
provision
of
nature
for
the
perpetuation
of
the
species
but
as
they
grow
up
the
case
is
different
our
partiality
is
then
confirmed
or
diminished
by
qualities
visible
to
an
impartial
bystander
as
really
as
to
ourselves
they
then
cease
to
be
merely
the
objects
of
our
solicitude
and
become
our
companions
the
partners
of
our
sentiments
and
the
counsellors
of
our
undertakings
such
at
least
was
my
case
at
the
present
period
charles
who
was
now
sixteen
was
manly
beyond
his
years
while
the
native
fire
of
his
disposition
was
tempered
by
adversity
by
an
humble
situation
and
by
the
ardour
of
filial
and
fraternal
affection
julia
who
was
two
years
younger
became
daily
more
interesting
by
the
mildness
of
her
disposition
and
the
tenderness
of
her
sensibility
louisa
was
only
twelve
but
as
she
was
extremely
notable
and
had
an
uncommonly
quick
and
accurate
spirit
of
imitation
she
rendered
herself
exceedingly
useful
to
her
mother
marguerite
the
plaything
and
amusement
of
the
family
had
as
i
have
said
just
completed
the
eighth
year
of
her
age
one
exquisite
source
of
gratification
when
it
is
not
a
source
of
uneasiness
to
speak
from
my
own
experience
which
a
parent
finds
in
the
society
of
his
children
is
their
individuality
they
are
not
puppets
moved
with
wires
and
to
be
played
on
at
will
almost
from
the
hour
of
their
birth
they
have
a
will
of
their
own
to
be
consulted
and
negotiated
with
we
may
say
to
them
as
adam
to
the
general
mother
of
mankind
but
now
thou
wert
flesh
of
my
flesh
and
bone
of
my
bone
and
even
now
thou
standest
before
me
vested
in
the
prerogatives
of
sentiment
and
reason
a
living
being
to
be
regarded
with
attention
and
deference
to
be
courted
not
compelled
susceptible
of
the
various
catalogue
of
human
passions
capable
of
resentment
and
gratitude
of
indignation
and
love
of
perverseness
and
submission
it
is
because
thou
art
thus
formed
that
i
love
thee
i
can
not
be
interested
about
objects
inanimate
or
brute
i
require
a
somewhat
that
shall
exercise
my
judgment
and
awaken
my
moral
feelings
it
is
necessary
to
me
to
approve
myself
and
be
approved
by
another
i
rejoice
to
stand
before
you
at
once
the
defendant
and
the
judge
i
rejoice
in
the
restraint
to
which
your
independent
character
subjects
me
and
it
will
be
my
pride
to
cultivate
that
independence
in
your
mind
i
would
negotiate
for
your
affections
and
confidence
and
not
be
loved
by
you
but
in
proportion
as
i
shall
have
done
something
to
deserve
it
i
could
not
congratulate
myself
upon
your
correspondence
to
my
wishes
if
it
had
not
been
in
your
power
to
withhold
while
i
indulge
this
vein
of
reflection
i
seem
again
to
see
my
family
as
they
surrounded
me
in
the
year
fifteen
hundred
and
marguerite
the
partner
of
my
life
charles
the
brother
of
my
cares
the
blooming
julia
the
sage
louisa
and
the
playful
cadette
of
the
family
how
richly
furnished
how
cheerful
how
appeared
to
me
the
apartment
in
which
they
were
assembled
i
dwell
upon
the
image
with
fond
affection
and
lingering
delight
where
are
they
now
how
has
all
this
happiness
been
maliciously
undermined
and
irrevocably
destroyed
to
look
back
on
it
it
seems
like
the
idle
fabric
of
a
dream
i
awake
and
find
myself
alone
were
there
really
such
persons
where
are
they
dispersed
whither
are
they
gone
oh
miserable
solitude
and
desertion
to
which
i
have
so
long
been
condemned
i
see
nothing
around
me
but
speechless
walls
or
human
faces
that
say
as
little
to
my
heart
as
the
walls
themselves
how
palsied
is
my
soul
how
withered
my
affections
but
i
will
not
anticipate
chapter
xii
i
carried
food
to
the
stranger
as
occasion
required
in
the
course
of
the
day
he
seemed
indisposed
to
speak
and
we
exchanged
scarcely
more
than
two
or
three
words
the
next
morning
was
the
implied
time
to
which
the
question
of
his
confidence
was
deferred
and
i
went
to
him
with
the
full
resolution
of
refusing
it
whether
it
were
that
he
discerned
this
resolution
in
my
countenance
or
that
in
the
interval
that
elapsed
he
had
formed
a
meaner
opinion
of
my
character
and
thought
me
unfit
for
the
purposes
he
intended
i
should
answer
certain
it
is
that
he
anticipated
me
at
the
same
time
he
magnified
the
importance
of
the
gifts
he
had
to
communicate
he
expressed
himself
astonished
at
the
precipitateness
of
his
yesterday
s
conduct
it
was
not
till
after
much
trial
and
long
probation
that
he
could
choose
himself
a
confidant
i
was
not
at
present
fit
for
the
character
nor
perhaps
ever
should
be
the
talent
he
possessed
was
one
upon
which
the
fate
of
nations
and
of
the
human
species
might
be
made
to
depend
god
had
given
it
for
the
best
and
highest
purposes
and
the
vessel
in
which
it
was
deposited
must
be
purified
from
the
alloy
of
human
frailty
it
might
be
abused
and
applied
to
the
most
atrocious
designs
it
might
blind
the
understanding
of
the
wisest
and
corrupt
the
integrity
of
the
noblest
it
might
overturn
kingdoms
and
change
the
whole
order
of
human
society
into
anarchy
and
barbarism
it
might
render
its
possessor
the
universal
plague
or
the
universal
tyrant
of
mankind
go
leon
added
the
stranger
you
are
not
qualified
for
so
important
a
trust
you
are
not
yet
purged
of
imbecility
and
weakness
though
you
have
passed
through
much
and
had
considerable
experience
you
are
yet
a
child
i
had
heard
your
history
and
expected
to
find
you
a
different
man
go
and
learn
to
know
yourself
for
what
you
are
frivolous
and
insignificant
worthy
to
have
been
born
a
peasant
and
not
fitted
to
adorn
the
rolls
of
chivalry
or
the
rank
to
which
you
were
destined
there
was
something
so
impressive
in
the
rebuke
and
contempt
of
this
venerable
sage
that
made
it
impossible
to
contend
with
them
never
was
there
a
man
more
singular
and
in
whom
were
united
greater
apparent
contradictions
observe
him
in
a
quiet
and
unanimated
moment
you
might
almost
take
him
for
a
common
beggar
a
poor
miserable
wretch
in
whom
life
lingered
and
insensate
stupidity
reigned
but
when
his
soul
was
touched
in
any
of
those
points
on
which
it
was
most
alive
he
rose
at
once
and
appeared
a
giant
his
voice
was
the
voice
of
thunder
and
rolling
in
a
rich
and
sublime
swell
it
arrested
and
stilled
while
it
withered
all
the
nerves
of
the
soul
his
sat
upon
your
countenance
and
seemed
to
look
through
you
you
wished
to
escape
from
its
penetrating
power
but
you
had
not
the
strength
to
move
i
began
to
feel
as
if
it
were
some
mysterious
and
superior
being
in
human
form
and
not
a
mortal
with
whom
i
was
concerned
what
a
strange
and
contradictory
being
is
man
i
had
gone
to
the
this
morning
with
a
firm
resolution
to
refuse
the
gifts
and
the
communication
of
the
stranger
i
felt
as
if
lightened
from
a
burthen
which
the
whole
preceding
day
had
oppressed
me
while
i
formed
this
resolution
i
was
cheerful
and
conscious
of
rectitude
and
strength
of
mind
how
cheaply
we
prize
a
gift
which
we
imagine
to
be
already
in
our
power
with
what
philosophical
indifference
do
we
turn
it
on
every
side
depreciate
its
worth
magnify
its
disadvantages
and
then
pique
ourselves
upon
the
sobriety
and
justice
of
the
estimate
we
have
made
thus
it
was
with
me
in
the
present
transaction
but
when
i
had
received
the
check
of
the
stranger
and
saw
the
proposed
benefit
removed
to
a
vast
and
uncertain
distance
then
it
resumed
all
its
charms
then
the
contrast
of
wealth
and
poverty
flashed
full
upon
my
soul
before
i
had
questioned
the
reality
of
the
stranger
s
pretensions
and
considered
whether
he
might
not
be
an
artful
impostor
but
now
all
was
clearness
and
certainty
the
advantages
of
wealth
passed
in
full
review
before
my
roused
imagination
i
saw
horses
palaces
and
their
furniture
i
saw
the
splendour
of
exhibition
and
the
trains
of
attendants
objects
which
had
been
for
ever
dear
to
my
puerile
imagination
i
contemplated
the
honour
love
obedience
troops
of
friends
which
are
so
apt
to
attend
upon
wealth
when
disbursed
with
a
moderate
degree
of
dignity
and
munificence
when
i
compared
this
with
my
present
poverty
and
desertion
the
meanness
of
our
appearance
our
daily
labours
the
danger
that
an
untoward
accident
might
sink
us
in
the
deepest
distress
and
the
hopelessness
that
my
son
or
his
posterity
should
ever
rise
to
that
honour
and
distinction
to
which
they
had
once
been
destined
the
effect
was
too
powerful
another
feeling
came
still
further
in
aid
of
this
it
was
the
humiliating
impression
which
the
stranger
had
left
upon
my
mind
this
seemed
to
be
his
great
art
if
in
reality
his
conduct
is
to
be
imputed
to
art
there
is
no
enemy
to
virtue
so
fatal
as
a
sense
of
degradation
is
our
principal
support
in
every
liberal
and
elevated
act
of
virtue
if
this
ally
can
be
turned
against
us
if
we
can
be
made
to
ascribe
baseness
effeminacy
want
of
spirit
and
adventure
to
our
virtuous
resolutions
we
shall
then
indeed
feel
ourselves
shaken
this
was
precisely
my
situation
the
figure
i
made
in
my
own
eyes
was
mean
i
was
impatient
of
my
degradation
i
believed
that
i
had
shown
myself
uxorious
and
effeminate
at
a
time
that
must
have
roused
in
me
the
spirit
of
a
man
if
there
had
been
a
spark
of
manly
spirit
latent
in
my
breast
this
impatience
with
the
temptations
of
the
stranger
and
made
me
anxious
to
possess
what
he
offered
to
my
acceptance
i
reasoned
thus
with
myself
what
excites
my
scruples
is
simply
the
idea
of
having
one
single
secret
from
my
wife
and
family
this
scruple
is
created
by
the
singular
and
unprecedented
confidence
in
which
we
have
been
accustomed
to
live
other
men
have
their
secrets
nor
do
they
find
their
domestic
tranquillity
broken
by
that
circumstance
the
merchant
does
not
call
his
wife
into
consultation
upon
his
ventures
the
statesman
does
not
unfold
to
her
his
policy
and
his
projects
the
warrior
does
not
take
her
advice
upon
the
plan
of
his
campaign
the
poet
does
not
concert
with
her
his
flights
and
his
episodes
to
other
men
the
domestic
scene
is
the
relaxation
of
their
cares
when
they
enter
it
they
dismiss
the
business
of
the
day
and
call
another
cause
i
only
have
concentrated
in
it
the
whole
of
my
existence
by
this
means
i
have
extinguished
in
myself
the
true
energy
of
the
human
character
a
man
can
never
be
respectable
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
or
in
his
own
except
so
far
as
he
stands
by
himself
and
is
truly
independent
he
may
have
friends
he
may
have
domestic
connections
but
he
must
not
in
these
connections
lose
his
individuality
nothing
truly
great
was
ever
achieved
that
was
not
executed
or
planned
in
solitary
seclusion
but
if
these
reasons
are
sufficient
to
prove
that
the
plan
i
have
lately
pursued
is
fundamentally
wrong
how
much
more
will
the
importance
of
what
is
proposed
by
the
stranger
plead
my
excuse
for
deviating
from
it
how
bitterly
have
i
lamented
the
degradation
of
my
family
shall
i
not
seize
this
opportunity
of
them
in
their
hereditary
honours
i
deemed
the
ruin
i
had
brought
upon
them
irreparable
shall
i
not
embrace
the
occasion
of
atoning
for
my
fault
no
man
despises
wealth
who
fully
understands
the
advantages
it
confers
does
it
not
confer
the
means
of
cultivating
our
powers
does
it
not
open
to
us
the
career
of
honour
which
is
shut
against
the
unknown
and
obscure
does
it
not
conciliate
the
prepossessions
of
mankind
and
gain
for
us
an
indulgent
and
liberal
construction
does
it
not
inspire
us
with
graceful
confidence
and
animate
us
to
generous
adventure
the
poor
man
is
denied
every
advantage
of
education
and
wears
out
his
life
in
labour
and
ignorance
from
offices
of
trust
from
opportunities
of
distinction
he
is
ignominiously
thrust
aside
and
though
he
should
sacrifice
his
life
for
the
public
cause
he
dies
unhonoured
and
unknown
if
by
any
accident
he
comes
into
possession
of
those
qualities
which
when
discerned
and
acknowledged
command
the
applause
of
mankind
who
will
listen
to
him
his
appearance
is
mean
and
the
fastidious
auditor
turns
from
him
ere
half
his
words
are
uttered
he
has
no
equipage
and
attendants
no
one
to
blow
the
trumpet
before
him
and
proclaim
his
rank
how
can
he
propose
any
thing
that
shall
be
worthy
of
attention
aware
of
the
prepossession
of
mankind
in
this
respect
he
is
alarmed
and
overwhelmed
with
confusion
before
he
opens
his
lips
filled
with
the
conscience
of
his
worth
he
anticipates
the
unmerited
contempt
that
is
prepared
to
oppress
him
and
his
very
heart
dies
within
him
add
to
these
circumstances
the
constitution
of
our
nature
the
various
pleasures
of
which
it
is
adapted
to
partake
and
how
many
of
these
pleasures
it
is
in
the
power
of
wealth
to
procure
yes
an
object
like
this
will
sufficiently
apologise
for
me
to
those
for
whose
sake
alone
it
was
estimable
in
my
sight
it
is
indeed
nothing
but
our
poverty
and
the
lowness
of
our
station
that
have
thus
produced
in
us
an
habitual
and
unreserved
communication
of
sentiments
wealth
would
to
a
certain
degree
destroy
our
contact
and
take
off
the
wonder
that
we
had
each
our
thoughts
that
were
not
put
into
the
common
stock
these
considerations
decided
my
choice
i
was
not
indeed
without
some
variations
of
mind
and
some
compunction
of
heart
for
the
resolution
i
had
espoused
the
longer
the
stranger
remained
with
me
the
more
evident
it
was
that
there
was
something
mysterious
between
us
and
the
unreserved
affection
and
union
that
had
lately
reigned
under
my
roof
suffered
materially
the
effects
of
it
the
stranger
had
been
led
to
my
cottage
in
the
first
instance
by
the
entire
solitude
in
which
it
was
placed
there
was
nothing
about
which
he
was
so
solicitous
as
concealment
the
most
atrocious
criminal
could
not
be
more
alarmed
at
the
idea
of
being
discovered
i
was
unable
to
account
for
this
but
i
was
now
too
anxious
for
his
stay
and
the
promised
reward
not
to
be
alert
in
gratifying
all
his
wishes
the
most
inviolable
secrecy
therefore
was
enjoined
to
the
whole
family
and
the
younger
branches
of
it
particularly
the
little
marguerite
it
was
necessary
to
keep
almost
immured
to
prevent
the
danger
of
their
reporting
any
thing
out
of
the
house
that
might
be
displeasing
to
the
stranger
and
fatal
to
my
expectations
upon
the
whole
my
situation
was
eminently
an
uneasy
one
no
experiment
can
be
more
precarious
than
that
of
a
and
nothing
but
the
sincere
affection
that
was
entertained
for
me
could
have
rendered
it
successful
in
this
instance
my
family
felt
that
they
were
trusted
by
me
only
in
points
where
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
it
and
that
i
was
not
therefore
properly
entitled
to
their
i
was
conscious
of
ingratitude
in
making
them
no
return
for
their
fidelity
they
kept
my
secret
because
they
were
solicitous
to
oblige
me
not
from
any
conviction
that
they
were
conferring
on
me
a
benefit
but
on
the
contrary
suspecting
that
the
object
as
to
which
they
were
blindly
assisting
me
would
prove
injurious
to
me
as
well
as
to
themselves
the
health
of
the
stranger
visibly
declined
but
this
was
a
circumstance
which
he
evidently
regarded
with
complacency
it
was
the
only
source
of
consolation
of
which
he
appeared
susceptible
his
mind
was
torn
with
painful
remembrances
and
agitated
with
terrible
forebodings
he
abhorred
solitude
and
yet
found
no
consolation
in
society
i
could
not
be
much
with
him
my
duty
to
my
family
who
were
principally
supported
by
my
labour
was
a
call
too
imperious
to
be
neglected
even
when
i
was
with
him
he
commonly
testified
no
desire
for
conversation
stay
with
me
he
was
accustomed
to
say
give
me
as
much
of
your
time
as
you
can
but
do
not
upon
these
occasions
he
would
sit
sometimes
with
his
arms
folded
and
with
the
most
melancholy
expression
imaginable
he
would
then
knit
his
brows
wring
his
hands
with
a
sadness
that
might
have
excited
pity
in
the
hardest
breast
or
with
both
hands
closed
the
one
clasping
the
other
strike
himself
impatiently
on
the
forehead
at
other
times
he
would
rise
from
his
seat
pace
the
room
with
hurried
and
unquiet
steps
and
then
again
throw
himself
on
his
couch
in
the
greatest
agitation
his
features
were
often
convulsed
with
agony
often
have
i
wiped
away
the
sweat
which
would
suddenly
burst
out
in
large
drops
on
his
forehead
at
those
seasons
he
would
continually
mutter
words
to
himself
the
sense
of
which
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
collect
i
could
perceive
however
that
he
often
repeated
the
names
of
clara
henry
a
wife
a
friend
a
friend
and
then
he
would
groan
as
if
his
heart
were
bursting
sometimes
in
the
midst
of
these
recollections
he
would
pass
the
back
of
his
hand
over
his
eyes
and
then
looking
at
it
shaking
his
head
and
biting
his
under
lip
exclaim
with
a
piteous
accent
dry
dry
all
the
moisture
of
my
frame
is
perished
then
as
if
recovering
himself
he
would
cry
with
a
startled
and
terrified
voice
who
is
there
leon
come
to
me
let
me
feel
that
there
is
a
human
being
near
me
i
often
call
for
you
but
i
find
myself
alone
deserted
friendless
friendless
at
times
when
his
recollection
was
more
complete
he
would
say
i
know
i
tire
you
why
should
i
tire
you
what
gratification
can
it
be
to
me
to
occasion
emotions
of
disgust
upon
these
occasions
i
endeavoured
to
soothe
him
and
assured
him
i
found
pleasure
in
administering
to
his
relief
but
he
replied
no
no
do
not
flatter
me
it
is
long
since
i
have
heard
the
voice
of
flattery
i
never
loved
it
no
i
know
i
am
precluded
from
ever
exciting
friendship
or
sympathy
why
am
i
not
dead
why
do
i
live
a
burthen
to
myself
useful
to
none
my
secret
i
could
almost
resolve
should
die
with
me
but
you
have
earned
and
you
shall
receive
the
stranger
was
not
always
in
this
state
of
extreme
anguish
nor
always
indisposed
to
converse
he
had
lucid
intervals
and
could
beguile
the
sorrow
of
his
heart
with
social
communication
we
sometimes
talked
of
various
sciences
and
branches
of
learning
he
appeared
to
be
well
informed
in
them
all
his
observations
were
ingenious
his
language
copious
his
illustrations
fanciful
and
picturesque
his
manner
bold
and
penetrating
it
was
easy
to
observe
in
him
the
marks
of
a
vigorous
and
masculine
genius
sometimes
we
discussed
the
events
at
that
time
going
on
in
the
world
when
we
discoursed
of
events
that
had
passed
and
persons
that
had
died
more
than
a
century
before
the
stranger
often
spoke
of
them
in
a
manner
as
if
he
had
been
an
and
directly
acquainted
with
the
objects
of
our
discourse
this
i
ascribed
to
the
vividness
of
his
conceptions
and
the
animation
of
his
language
he
however
often
checked
himself
in
this
peculiarity
and
always
carefully
avoided
what
could
lead
to
any
thing
personal
to
himself
i
described
to
him
the
scenes
of
my
youth
and
related
my
subsequent
history
he
on
his
part
was
invincibly
silent
on
every
circumstance
of
his
country
his
family
and
his
adventures
the
longer
i
was
acquainted
with
him
the
more
my
curiosity
grew
i
was
restless
and
impatient
to
learn
something
respecting
a
man
who
thus
wrapped
himself
up
in
mystery
and
reserve
often
i
threw
out
as
it
were
a
line
by
which
to
fathom
his
secret
i
talked
of
various
countries
i
mentioned
different
kinds
of
calamities
and
even
of
crimes
that
by
some
incidental
allusion
i
might
discover
at
unawares
his
country
his
connections
or
the
nature
of
his
story
when
any
thing
that
offered
seemed
to
lead
to
the
desired
point
i
doubled
my
questions
and
endeavoured
to
construct
them
with
the
skill
of
a
crafty
litigant
in
a
court
of
justice
there
were
some
subjects
the
very
mention
of
which
gave
him
uneasiness
and
upon
which
he
immediately
silenced
me
but
these
were
not
of
themselves
enough
to
afford
me
a
clue
or
to
furnish
materials
out
of
which
for
me
to
construct
the
history
of
the
stranger
he
did
not
always
perceive
the
drift
of
my
questions
and
snares
but
when
he
did
he
generally
became
loud
resentful
and
furious
there
was
nothing
else
that
so
completely
roused
his
indignation
st
leon
said
he
to
me
one
day
silence
this
inquisitive
temper
of
yours
check
your
rash
and
rude
curiosity
the
only
secret
i
have
that
can
be
of
any
importance
to
you
you
shall
one
day
know
but
my
country
my
family
my
adventures
i
have
once
told
you
and
i
tell
you
again
you
shall
never
know
that
knowledge
can
be
of
moment
to
no
one
and
it
shall
never
be
disclosed
when
this
heart
ceases
to
beat
that
tale
shall
cease
to
have
a
place
on
the
face
of
the
earth
why
should
my
distresses
and
disgraces
be
published
to
any
one
is
it
not
enough
that
they
have
lacerated
my
bosom
that
they
have
deprived
me
of
friends
that
they
have
visited
me
with
every
adversity
and
every
anguish
that
they
have
bowed
me
down
to
the
earth
that
they
have
made
thought
and
remembrance
and
life
itself
a
burthen
too
heavy
to
be
borne
your
present
injudicious
conduct
if
persisted
in
will
have
the
effect
of
driving
me
from
your
roof
of
turning
me
once
more
upon
the
world
upon
that
world
that
i
hate
upon
that
world
whose
bruises
and
ill
treatment
i
feel
in
every
fibre
of
my
frame
of
exposing
me
again
to
fresh
persecutions
and
causing
me
to
perish
miserably
in
a
dungeon
or
die
upon
a
scaffold
spare
me
my
generous
host
i
know
you
are
capable
of
generosity
indeed
i
have
endured
enough
to
satiate
the
rage
of
malice
itself
you
see
what
i
suffer
from
the
rage
and
tempest
of
my
own
thoughts
even
without
the
assistance
of
any
external
foe
let
me
die
in
that
degree
of
tranquillity
i
am
able
to
attain
i
will
not
trouble
you
at
another
time
he
addressed
me
in
a
different
style
you
see
leon
that
the
anguish
of
mind
i
endure
is
such
as
is
ordinarily
attributed
to
the
recollection
of
great
crimes
and
you
have
very
probably
conjectured
that
in
my
case
it
arises
from
the
same
source
if
you
have
i
forgive
you
but
i
assure
you
that
you
are
mistaken
take
from
yourself
that
uneasiness
if
it
has
ever
visited
you
you
are
not
giving
sanctuary
to
a
villain
i
am
innocent
i
can
take
no
crime
to
my
charge
i
have
suffered
more
almost
than
man
ever
suffered
but
i
have
sinned
little
the
cause
of
my
uneasiness
and
prime
source
of
all
my
misfortunes
i
dare
not
disclose
to
you
be
contented
with
the
plan
of
my
conduct
i
have
digested
my
purpose
i
have
determined
where
to
speak
and
where
to
be
the
more
i
saw
of
this
man
the
more
strange
and
unaccountable
appeared
to
me
every
thing
that
related
to
him
why
was
he
so
poor
possessing
as
he
pretended
inexhaustible
wealth
why
was
he
unhappy
with
so
great
talents
and
genius
and
such
various
information
why
was
he
friendless
being
as
he
solemnly
assured
me
so
perfectly
innocent
and
of
consequence
so
respectable
that
he
was
an
impostor
every
thing
that
i
saw
of
him
forbade
me
to
believe
his
sorrows
were
too
profound
and
excruciating
for
it
to
be
possible
for
me
to
rank
them
among
the
actions
that
a
man
may
play
the
greatness
of
his
powers
the
dignity
of
his
carriage
the
irresistible
appearance
of
sincerity
that
sparkled
in
his
eye
and
modulated
his
voice
fully
convinced
me
that
he
really
was
what
he
pretended
to
be
i
had
heard
of
men
who
under
the
pretence
of
alchemy
fastened
themselves
upon
persons
possessing
sums
of
money
and
beguiling
them
with
a
delusive
expectation
of
wealth
reduced
them
to
beggary
and
ruin
one
such
person
i
had
had
a
brief
connection
with
during
my
residence
in
the
bordelois
though
finding
the
incident
by
no
means
essential
to
the
progress
of
my
history
i
have
passed
it
over
together
with
many
others
in
silence
but
nothing
could
be
more
unlike
than
that
man
and
the
person
respecting
whom
i
was
now
concerned
in
reality
i
possessed
at
that
time
if
i
may
be
allowed
to
say
so
a
more
than
common
insight
into
the
characters
of
mankind
so
as
to
be
little
likely
except
under
the
tyranny
of
passion
as
in
the
instance
of
gaming
to
be
made
the
prey
of
imposition
i
had
studied
my
species
as
it
exhibits
itself
in
history
and
had
mixed
with
it
in
various
scenes
and
under
dissimilar
aspects
i
had
accordingly
in
the
transaction
i
have
just
alluded
to
soon
detected
the
plans
of
the
villain
who
expected
to
delude
me
but
what
could
be
the
purpose
of
the
stranger
in
this
respect
the
pretended
alchemist
in
france
had
obtained
a
certain
sum
of
money
of
me
and
demanded
more
the
stranger
never
made
such
a
demand
of
me
and
perfectly
knew
that
even
if
i
had
been
inclined
i
was
not
able
to
supply
him
the
alchemist
had
amused
me
with
descriptions
of
various
processes
for
the
transmutation
of
metals
had
exhibited
his
crucibles
and
retorts
and
employed
a
sort
of
dramatic
d
for
the
purpose
of
awakening
my
curiosity
and
stimulating
my
passions
the
stranger
had
simply
stated
in
the
plainest
and
most
direct
manner
that
it
was
in
his
power
to
enrich
me
but
had
been
silent
as
to
the
manner
of
producing
the
wealth
he
promised
and
had
abstained
from
every
effort
to
intoxicate
my
mind
i
felt
therefore
in
this
instance
the
effect
that
without
being
able
to
solve
the
difficulties
and
contrarieties
that
hung
about
him
i
yet
believed
his
assertions
nor
was
the
inscrutability
of
his
history
and
his
motives
capable
of
shaking
my
confidence
one
day
during
the
period
of
his
concealment
certain
officers
of
the
bishop
of
constance
accompanied
by
a
foreigner
in
a
neapolitan
habit
came
to
my
house
and
as
it
proved
with
the
express
purpose
of
searching
for
the
man
who
had
put
himself
under
my
protection
charles
and
myself
were
at
work
in
the
fields
within
sight
of
the
lake
their
appearance
first
caught
the
attention
of
charles
as
they
approached
the
shore
and
he
enquired
of
me
respecting
the
habit
of
the
foreigner
which
was
different
from
any
he
had
been
accustomed
to
see
while
we
were
yet
speaking
i
observed
in
them
an
intention
to
land
within
sight
of
my
cottage
this
was
an
uncommon
circumstance
our
privacy
was
rarely
invaded
and
we
lived
almost
as
much
out
of
the
world
as
we
should
have
done
in
the
remotest
island
of
the
atlantic
ocean
i
reasoned
in
my
own
mind
upon
their
appearance
they
had
little
resemblance
to
a
party
of
pleasure
the
habit
of
the
officers
of
justice
i
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
and
the
suspicion
of
the
real
nature
of
their
errand
immediately
darted
on
my
thoughts
without
saying
a
word
to
charles
on
the
subject
i
hastened
with
all
the
speed
i
could
exert
to
the
apartment
of
the
stranger
and
acquainted
him
with
what
i
had
seen
he
concurred
with
me
in
the
ideas
i
had
formed
and
appeared
much
shocked
at
the
intelligence
there
was
however
no
time
to
be
lost
and
after
having
for
a
moment
given
vent
to
an
anguish
which
was
too
powerful
to
be
suppressed
he
withdrew
as
hastily
as
he
could
from
the
and
betook
himself
to
the
woods
he
recommended
to
me
to
leave
him
telling
me
that
he
could
conceal
himself
most
effectually
alone
and
observing
that
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
meet
the
officers
and
endeavour
as
much
as
possible
to
remove
their
suspicions
accordingly
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
i
threw
open
the
windows
of
the
removed
the
shutters
and
took
from
it
as
effectually
as
i
could
all
appearance
of
having
served
as
a
place
of
concealment
this
was
a
precaution
which
the
stranger
had
on
a
former
occasion
recommended
to
me
it
fortunately
happened
that
julia
and
the
little
marguerite
were
gone
out
together
in
the
fields
on
the
eastern
side
of
my
cottage
otherwise
infallibly
the
child
by
her
innocent
prattle
and
perhaps
julia
by
the
apprehensive
sensibility
of
her
temper
would
have
betrayed
our
secret
or
at
least
have
suggested
to
the
officers
a
feeling
as
if
by
a
longer
stay
and
a
more
diligent
search
they
might
possibly
succeed
in
the
object
of
their
expedition
as
it
was
i
received
them
at
the
door
and
learned
from
their
own
mouths
the
nature
of
their
errand
of
charles
whom
they
had
crossed
in
the
fields
they
had
simply
asked
whether
they
were
right
as
to
the
name
of
the
person
who
was
proprietor
of
the
cottage
before
them
they
described
to
me
with
great
accuracy
the
appearance
of
the
stranger
and
insisted
that
he
had
been
an
inhabitant
of
my
cottage
they
told
me
they
were
well
informed
that
the
in
my
garden
had
carefully
been
shut
up
for
more
than
a
month
past
and
that
some
person
had
been
concealed
there
i
was
interested
in
the
distress
of
the
stranger
i
was
impressed
with
the
dignity
of
his
character
i
implicitly
confided
in
his
assertions
of
innocence
and
the
unjust
persecution
that
he
suffered
i
was
not
insensible
to
the
proposed
reward
the
realising
of
which
probably
depended
on
his
safety
but
most
of
all
i
considered
my
honour
as
pledged
for
the
protection
of
the
man
who
had
thus
cast
himself
upon
my
fidelity
and
believed
that
i
should
be
everlastingly
disgraced
if
he
suffered
any
evil
through
treachery
or
neglect
on
my
part
i
therefore
answered
confidently
to
the
officers
that
they
were
misinformed
and
offered
to
conduct
them
over
every
part
of
my
house
and
demesnes
that
they
might
satisfy
themselves
by
inspection
that
there
was
no
person
concealed
any
where
within
my
possessions
i
should
have
been
better
pleased
openly
to
have
defied
their
interrogatories
and
to
have
asked
them
whether
allowing
their
suspicions
to
be
just
they
were
entitled
to
believe
that
i
was
such
a
villain
as
to
betray
a
man
who
had
thrown
himself
upon
my
generosity
but
though
this
conduct
would
have
had
a
greater
appearance
of
gallantry
i
believed
it
would
have
less
of
the
reality
as
it
would
have
strengthened
their
idea
of
my
participation
and
increased
the
danger
of
the
person
i
was
bound
to
protect
they
accepted
my
offer
of
submitting
to
their
search
and
made
a
strict
examination
of
every
place
about
my
habitation
in
which
the
stranger
could
be
concealed
disappointed
here
they
endeavoured
by
threats
to
discover
whether
i
was
able
to
give
them
any
information
to
these
i
calmly
answered
that
they
had
mistaken
my
character
that
though
i
was
a
poor
man
i
had
not
forgotten
that
i
was
noble
that
they
were
already
in
possession
of
my
spontaneous
answer
to
their
enquiries
and
that
in
no
case
and
upon
no
supposition
should
tyranny
and
ill
treatment
extort
from
me
what
i
was
not
in
the
first
instance
disposed
to
give
my
wife
was
present
during
this
conversation
and
i
could
perceive
felt
an
alarm
for
my
danger
that
she
would
have
been
incapable
of
feeling
for
a
danger
to
herself
though
i
was
extremely
anxious
that
these
men
should
be
disappointed
in
the
object
of
their
expedition
yet
i
did
not
neglect
this
opportunity
of
endeavouring
to
obtain
satisfaction
for
my
own
curiosity
i
remarked
at
first
that
the
neapolitan
was
an
inquisitor
and
this
circumstance
had
given
additional
poignancy
to
the
uneasiness
of
marguerite
but
the
accusations
of
which
the
inquisition
at
this
time
took
cognisance
were
so
numerous
the
ecclesiastical
power
continually
usurping
upon
the
civil
that
i
was
little
assisted
in
the
judgment
i
was
desirous
to
frame
by
any
inference
to
be
deduced
from
this
circumstance
i
questioned
directly
with
an
air
as
if
it
were
merely
in
the
way
of
conversation
what
was
the
crime
of
the
man
of
whom
they
were
in
pursuit
and
what
was
the
cause
forcible
enough
to
induce
a
neapolitan
inquisitor
to
follow
so
decrepit
and
forlorn
an
individual
as
he
described
beyond
the
alps
and
almost
to
the
banks
of
the
danube
to
this
he
answered
roughly
that
though
he
was
not
able
to
discover
the
object
of
his
search
he
was
by
no
means
convinced
that
i
was
not
his
abettor
and
accomplice
and
that
as
to
his
crime
that
was
not
to
be
named
the
welfare
of
christendom
demanding
that
the
criminal
and
the
memory
of
his
offences
should
be
buried
together
at
the
same
time
he
warned
me
to
consider
well
what
i
did
before
i
exposed
myself
to
be
overwhelmed
by
the
vengeance
of
the
court
of
which
he
was
a
member
to
this
i
answered
haughtily
that
i
had
already
condescended
to
repel
his
suspicion
and
that
no
other
man
than
an
inquisitor
would
have
had
the
stupidity
or
the
audaciousness
to
question
my
veracity
i
added
that
i
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
his
court
which
was
an
object
of
abhorrence
to
the
whole
christian
world
but
that
he
was
mistaken
if
he
supposed
that
the
detestable
nature
of
its
proceedings
would
enable
him
to
practise
every
sort
of
outrage
with
impunity
the
officers
withdrew
into
the
little
inclosure
in
front
of
my
cottage
and
i
overheard
them
consulting
whether
having
failed
in
their
principal
object
they
should
carry
me
a
prisoner
along
with
them
the
firmness
of
my
manner
however
had
awed
them
and
the
fearlessness
i
expressed
seemed
to
them
to
arise
from
a
consciousness
of
innocence
they
at
length
departed
as
they
came
i
watched
them
from
my
cottage
as
they
descended
to
the
shore
and
it
was
with
no
little
pleasure
that
i
perceived
them
and
stand
off
for
the
opposite
side
of
the
lake
this
spectacle
for
a
time
entirely
engaged
me
and
when
i
turned
from
the
door
i
observed
that
my
beloved
marguerite
had
been
in
tears
she
endeavoured
to
hide
this
circumstance
from
my
sight
i
took
her
affectionately
by
the
hand
and
pressing
her
to
my
bosom
entreated
her
not
to
make
herself
uneasy
ah
reginald
said
she
how
can
i
avoid
being
uneasy
when
i
see
you
exposed
to
this
imminent
danger
i
thought
that
in
forfeiting
our
fortune
and
our
rank
and
retiring
to
this
obscure
and
sequestered
situation
we
might
at
least
promise
ourselves
the
blessing
of
the
poor
oblivion
and
security
and
that
should
have
consoled
me
for
all
i
have
lost
who
is
this
man
that
is
thus
mysteriously
hidden
among
us
what
is
the
guilt
from
the
punishment
of
which
he
thus
anxiously
withdraws
himself
what
can
be
the
nature
of
your
connection
with
such
a
man
and
what
will
be
the
issue
of
so
perilous
an
adventure
i
hesitated
i
knew
not
what
to
answer
to
so
earnest
an
anxiety
i
was
melted
at
the
distress
and
the
affection
of
marguerite
she
saw
my
embarrassment
and
proceeded
mistake
me
not
my
beloved
said
she
i
have
no
desire
to
pry
into
what
you
are
willing
to
conceal
forgive
the
perturbation
which
has
poured
itself
out
in
these
involuntary
questions
i
repose
an
entire
confidence
in
you
i
would
sooner
die
than
interfere
with
any
object
you
have
at
heart
go
on
according
to
the
dictates
of
your
own
judgment
undisturbed
by
me
i
will
not
doubt
that
you
have
sufficient
reasons
for
what
you
communicate
and
what
you
suppress
i
am
grieved
indeed
at
the
interruption
of
our
obscure
and
unambitious
tranquillity
but
i
had
resolved
not
to
trouble
you
with
my
uneasiness
and
apprehensions
the
incident
of
this
morning
has
extorted
them
from
me
but
i
will
behave
better
in
this
scene
was
extremely
distressing
to
me
my
wife
was
oppressed
with
fears
and
i
had
nothing
to
answer
her
the
consolations
that
rose
up
in
my
own
mind
i
was
prevented
from
communicating
the
more
generously
she
confided
in
me
the
more
i
felt
the
ungracious
and
disagreeable
nature
of
the
concealment
i
practised
i
endeavoured
however
to
encourage
myself
with
the
idea
that
the
labour
would
not
be
long
and
the
harvest
would
prove
abundant
i
said
in
my
own
mind
the
worst
is
now
over
the
business
has
been
commenced
the
shock
to
my
own
family
has
actually
occurred
i
must
go
on
resolutely
and
shut
my
eyes
to
the
temporarily
displeasing
circumstances
that
may
be
connected
with
the
completing
my
object
chapter
xiii
another
source
of
uneasiness
was
added
to
the
distraction
my
mind
already
endured
the
stranger
did
not
appear
it
was
in
the
morning
that
the
officers
of
justice
arrived
they
departed
about
noon
and
in
two
hours
afterwards
i
entered
the
wood
in
search
of
my
guest
the
wood
was
of
some
leagues
in
extent
it
was
intersected
by
paths
in
various
directions
it
was
interspersed
with
caverns
its
growth
was
of
all
kinds
in
some
places
lofty
trees
that
seemed
to
form
a
support
for
the
clouds
in
others
an
underwood
impenetrable
alike
to
the
feet
and
to
the
eye
as
i
entered
the
wood
i
however
conceived
that
the
discovery
of
the
stranger
to
me
who
was
acquainted
with
its
would
be
an
affair
of
little
toil
his
feebleness
and
decrepitude
would
not
suffer
him
to
proceed
to
any
great
distance
in
this
i
was
mistaken
i
looked
carefully
on
all
sides
i
examined
every
recess
and
corner
with
which
i
was
acquainted
but
i
found
no
trace
of
the
stranger
the
scene
was
so
complicated
and
involved
that
even
this
was
a
labour
of
considerable
duration
at
length
i
became
satisfied
that
he
was
not
in
the
nearer
division
of
the
wood
i
paused
i
felt
at
once
that
it
was
little
less
than
a
herculean
task
to
hunt
through
the
whole
of
its
dimensions
it
would
probably
be
of
little
use
to
call
and
endeavour
by
that
means
to
discover
his
retreat
i
knew
of
no
name
by
which
he
was
to
be
recognised
and
if
my
own
voice
was
but
a
slight
resource
to
penetrate
this
immense
labyrinth
of
foliage
the
voice
of
the
stranger
weakened
by
age
and
now
probably
still
more
enfeebled
by
hunger
and
fatigue
could
not
be
expected
to
make
itself
heard
beside
which
as
i
knew
not
what
the
source
of
information
had
been
to
the
officers
who
had
just
left
me
i
was
unwilling
to
expose
my
guest
to
the
danger
that
might
arise
from
this
mode
of
seeking
him
i
could
not
even
be
sure
though
i
had
seen
their
boat
stand
off
from
the
shore
that
they
might
not
afterwards
land
one
or
more
of
their
party
and
be
at
this
very
moment
within
of
me
i
therefore
proceeded
in
anxiety
and
silence
my
search
was
no
more
successful
in
the
part
of
the
wood
with
which
i
was
little
acquainted
than
in
the
part
with
which
i
was
most
familiar
i
had
already
been
engaged
four
hours
in
the
task
and
night
began
to
come
on
it
shut
in
with
heavy
clouds
that
on
all
sides
appeared
deeply
loaded
with
rain
i
now
began
to
consider
my
own
situation
and
by
comparing
circumstances
found
that
i
was
at
a
great
distance
from
my
own
habitation
there
was
no
direct
path
by
which
for
me
to
return
i
had
proceeded
to
the
right
and
the
left
backward
and
forward
sometimes
by
more
open
paths
and
sometimes
forcing
my
way
through
briars
and
brushwood
as
caprice
or
the
hope
of
effecting
the
object
of
my
search
happened
to
guide
me
it
was
therefore
no
easy
matter
to
guess
how
i
was
to
return
or
even
now
that
the
lowering
clouds
had
covered
the
horizon
with
one
uniform
tint
in
which
direction
lay
the
cottage
or
the
lake
while
i
stood
contemplating
what
was
to
be
done
i
heard
the
howling
of
the
wolves
at
a
distance
and
their
howl
had
that
particular
melancholy
and
discomfiting
sound
which
is
well
known
to
precede
a
coming
storm
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
and
accordingly
i
set
out
i
was
less
anxious
to
be
at
home
on
my
own
account
than
for
the
sake
of
quieting
the
alarms
of
my
family
to
whom
i
had
already
occasioned
too
great
a
portion
of
uneasiness
i
had
not
proceeded
far
before
the
rain
descended
in
torrents
intermingled
with
peals
of
thunder
and
sheets
of
lightning
the
thunder
interrupted
as
it
were
from
time
to
time
with
the
noise
of
the
wild
beasts
that
inhabited
the
wood
deafened
me
while
the
excessive
and
instantaneous
brilliancy
of
the
lightning
occasioned
me
an
intolerable
aching
in
the
organ
of
sight
it
rained
incessantly
for
two
hours
and
i
found
myself
drenched
and
fatigued
with
the
wet
during
this
time
my
progress
was
small
and
i
was
ever
and
anon
intercepted
by
the
underwood
and
could
not
without
repeated
experiments
discover
the
means
of
proceeding
at
length
the
rain
subsided
and
seemed
to
give
place
to
a
gloomy
and
motionless
calm
soon
after
i
discovered
a
light
at
a
distance
and
advanced
towards
it
as
i
approached
i
perceived
that
it
proceeded
from
a
set
of
banditti
to
the
amount
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
persons
sitting
round
a
fire
in
the
mouth
of
a
cavern
i
was
glad
to
turn
my
steps
another
way
and
was
for
some
time
afraid
that
the
noise
i
made
in
occasionally
forcing
my
way
through
the
bushes
would
alarm
them
and
cost
me
my
life
i
however
fortunately
escaped
their
notice
this
was
in
a
part
of
the
wood
remote
from
the
path
i
ought
to
have
taken
and
near
the
road
to
lindau
the
day
began
to
dawn
before
i
reached
my
own
habitation
the
conjecture
i
had
made
when
i
was
unawares
upon
the
point
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
banditti
that
the
road
of
lindau
was
on
the
other
side
of
their
retreat
was
of
some
service
to
me
as
an
indication
where
to
find
the
cottage
and
the
lake
this
road
skirted
the
wood
on
the
side
nearly
opposite
to
that
by
which
i
entered
it
the
difficulties
however
i
had
to
encounter
were
inconceivably
great
in
endeavouring
to
preserve
my
line
of
direction
after
having
been
compelled
four
or
five
times
to
deviate
from
the
line
it
is
seldom
that
a
traveller
will
find
himself
right
in
his
conjecture
as
to
the
direction
he
is
pursuing
unless
he
has
some
sensible
object
as
a
sort
of
by
which
to
govern
his
route
it
happened
in
this
instance
that
i
was
more
fortunate
than
i
was
entitled
to
expect
i
laboured
indeed
till
daybreak
without
getting
out
of
the
labyrinth
that
inclosed
me
but
the
sun
no
sooner
began
to
lend
an
imperfect
light
than
i
recognised
certain
objects
which
upon
some
former
occasions
i
had
observed
and
perceived
that
my
journey
was
nearly
at
an
end
i
entered
my
cottage
and
found
marguerite
alone
awake
and
expecting
me
she
had
been
somewhat
uneasy
on
account
of
my
absence
both
from
the
extreme
tempestuousness
of
the
night
and
in
consequence
of
the
painful
sensations
the
events
of
the
preceding
morning
had
introduced
events
with
which
it
was
almost
unavoidable
for
her
to
imagine
that
my
absence
was
in
some
way
connected
the
period
of
my
insanity
in
switzerland
might
indeed
have
accustomed
her
to
the
irregularity
of
my
motions
but
a
term
of
more
than
six
years
which
had
intervened
had
produced
in
her
expectations
and
habits
of
a
different
sort
i
related
to
this
admirable
woman
the
adventures
of
the
night
and
the
fruitlessness
of
the
search
in
which
i
had
been
engaged
and
this
openness
of
communication
unresembling
the
nature
of
the
intercourse
which
had
lately
existed
between
us
relieved
in
some
degree
my
burthened
heart
and
cheered
the
drooping
spirits
of
marguerite
she
dropped
some
consolatory
and
sadly
pleasing
tears
and
her
manner
seemed
to
say
though
she
would
not
suffer
her
tongue
to
give
the
idea
words
how
sweet
are
cordiality
and
confidence
oh
do
not
let
our
situation
which
has
deprived
us
of
many
other
comforts
ever
again
be
robbed
of
this
comfort
which
is
alone
worth
all
the
rest
though
she
necessarily
felt
the
presence
of
the
stranger
as
an
evil
the
bane
of
our
domestic
peace
yet
it
was
impossible
for
her
not
to
compassionate
his
fate
and
suffer
some
distress
from
his
strange
and
abrupt
disappearance
after
the
conversation
which
had
so
eminently
served
as
a
relief
to
our
minds
marguerite
left
me
to
repose
myself
from
the
extraordinary
fatigue
i
had
undergone
but
my
mind
was
too
much
disturbed
to
suffer
me
to
sink
into
the
arms
of
forgetfulness
i
felt
something
tragical
in
the
sad
destiny
of
my
unfortunate
guest
it
was
but
too
probable
that
in
his
peculiarly
weak
state
of
body
and
with
his
declining
health
the
being
thus
exposed
for
a
day
and
a
night
to
the
effects
of
hunger
of
the
inclemency
of
the
air
and
the
tempestuousness
of
the
elements
would
put
a
close
to
his
existence
i
was
determined
soon
to
recommence
my
search
but
how
could
i
be
sure
that
i
should
be
more
fortunate
than
the
day
before
if
i
found
him
it
was
most
likely
i
should
find
him
either
dead
or
dying
the
degree
of
intercourse
that
had
taken
place
between
us
had
made
him
occupy
a
considerable
space
in
my
thoughts
the
prospects
he
had
opened
to
me
the
conduct
he
had
induced
me
to
adopt
the
painful
effects
and
dissatisfaction
of
mind
which
had
been
produced
by
that
conduct
as
it
respected
my
family
all
combined
to
give
me
an
interest
in
his
fate
i
had
seen
his
talents
i
had
felt
his
ascendancy
i
had
experienced
that
sort
of
conflict
which
appearances
of
guilt
on
the
one
hand
and
asseverations
of
innocence
on
the
other
are
calculated
to
produce
in
the
thoughts
and
emotions
of
a
bystander
he
was
no
common
man
the
expectations
and
conjectures
he
excited
were
of
no
ordinary
sort
and
i
felt
that
an
army
might
be
destroyed
and
a
spacious
plain
covered
with
the
wounded
and
the
dying
without
producing
greater
commotion
in
my
soul
in
the
anxious
and
disturbed
state
of
mind
in
which
i
was
the
thoughts
flow
with
extraordinary
rapidity
it
will
be
found
attended
with
a
strange
and
previously
to
the
experiment
incredible
mixture
of
reasoning
and
passion
of
philosophising
and
fury
i
was
accordingly
conscious
at
this
moment
of
the
truth
of
the
stranger
s
assertion
that
in
me
he
had
a
protector
not
a
friend
friendship
is
an
object
of
a
peculiar
sort
the
smallest
reserve
is
deadly
to
it
i
may
indeed
feel
the
emotions
of
a
friend
towards
a
man
who
in
part
conceals
from
me
the
thoughts
of
his
heart
but
then
i
must
be
unconscious
of
this
concealment
the
instant
i
perceive
this
limitation
of
confidence
he
drops
into
the
class
of
ordinary
men
a
divorce
is
effected
between
us
our
hearts
which
grew
together
suffer
amputation
the
arteries
are
closed
the
blood
is
no
longer
mutually
transfused
and
confounded
i
shall
be
conscious
of
all
his
qualities
for
i
stand
in
the
place
of
an
impartial
umpire
i
consider
him
as
a
machine
capable
of
so
much
utility
to
myself
and
so
much
utility
to
other
men
but
i
do
not
regard
him
as
the
brother
of
my
soul
i
do
not
feel
that
my
life
is
bound
up
in
his
i
do
not
feel
as
if
were
he
to
die
the
whole
world
would
be
at
an
end
to
me
and
that
my
happiness
would
be
buried
with
him
for
ever
in
the
darkness
of
the
grave
i
am
not
conscious
of
those
emotions
which
are
the
most
exquisite
and
indescribable
the
human
mind
can
experience
and
which
being
communicated
by
a
sort
of
electrical
stroke
to
him
who
is
their
object
constitute
the
solace
of
all
his
cares
the
alleviator
of
all
his
calamities
the
only
nectar
and
truest
balm
of
human
life
for
me
he
stands
alone
in
the
world
having
companions
and
associates
the
connections
as
it
were
of
mercantile
selfishness
or
casual
jollity
and
good
humour
but
no
friend
it
was
thus
that
i
thought
of
the
stranger
he
obtained
from
me
the
compassion
due
to
a
human
being
and
the
respect
extorted
by
his
qualities
but
nothing
calculated
radically
to
disturb
the
equilibrium
of
the
mind
i
looked
forward
to
his
death
with
unruffled
thoughts
and
an
unmoistened
eye
there
was
one
thing
indeed
that
shook
me
more
deeply
the
thought
of
losing
the
promised
reward
and
of
having
exposed
myself
to
the
evil
of
an
unquiet
and
dissatisfied
mind
in
vain
i
rested
but
a
few
hours
before
i
set
out
again
upon
the
search
to
which
the
interposition
of
the
darkness
of
the
preceding
night
had
put
an
abrupt
close
i
had
the
precaution
to
take
with
me
a
slight
provision
of
food
and
cordials
believing
that
if
i
found
the
stranger
he
would
at
least
be
in
the
greatest
need
of
something
reviving
and
restorative
charles
earnestly
intreated
to
assist
me
in
the
search
but
upon
this
i
put
a
peremptory
prohibition
it
would
have
been
in
direct
contradiction
to
what
the
stranger
had
most
solemnly
required
of
me
i
had
already
spent
several
hours
in
anxiously
tracing
the
wood
in
every
direction
and
the
period
of
noon
was
past
when
approaching
an
obscure
and
almost
impenetrable
thicket
my
ear
was
caught
by
a
low
and
melancholy
sound
which
at
first
i
knew
not
to
what
i
was
to
ascribe
it
however
arrested
my
attention
and
caused
me
to
assume
an
attitude
of
listening
after
the
lapse
of
little
more
than
a
minute
the
same
sound
was
repeated
i
now
distinctly
perceived
that
it
was
the
groan
of
some
creature
in
a
very
feeble
and
exhausted
state
and
immediately
suspected
that
it
was
the
stranger
i
went
almost
round
the
thicket
before
i
could
discern
an
entrance
and
though
i
looked
with
the
utmost
care
could
perceive
nothing
that
the
thicket
inclosed
the
groan
was
repeated
a
third
time
the
long
intervals
between
the
groans
gave
a
peculiar
melancholy
to
the
effect
and
each
seemed
so
much
lower
than
the
groan
before
that
nothing
but
the
ear
of
anxious
attention
would
have
caught
it
at
the
same
time
that
the
tone
conveyed
an
idea
of
stupified
yet
vital
anguish
at
length
i
perceived
the
legs
and
something
of
the
garb
of
a
man
it
was
the
stranger
he
appeared
to
have
crept
into
the
thicket
upon
his
hands
and
knees
when
i
forced
my
way
to
him
he
seemed
in
the
very
act
of
expiring
he
was
lying
on
his
face
and
i
raised
him
a
little
his
eyes
were
fixed
his
mouth
was
open
his
lips
and
tongue
were
parched
and
dry
i
infused
a
few
drops
of
a
cordial
into
his
mouth
for
a
moment
it
appeared
to
produce
no
sensation
but
presently
my
patient
uttered
a
deep
and
sigh
i
repeated
my
application
as
a
principal
cause
of
the
condition
in
which
i
found
him
was
inanition
the
stimulant
i
administered
produced
a
powerful
effect
he
moved
his
hands
shuddered
turned
his
eyes
languidly
upon
me
and
having
appeared
to
recognise
me
shut
them
hastily
again
i
moved
him
slowly
and
softly
into
a
freer
air
and
bathed
his
temples
with
one
of
the
liquids
i
had
about
me
by
this
time
he
looked
up
and
then
suddenly
round
him
with
a
wild
and
hurried
air
he
spoke
not
however
he
was
speechless
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
relapsed
into
convulsions
in
which
it
seemed
probable
he
would
expire
they
lasted
a
considerable
time
and
he
then
sunk
into
a
state
of
insensibility
i
thought
he
was
dead
thus
circumstanced
it
was
some
relief
to
my
humanity
to
have
found
him
yet
alive
and
to
have
received
his
parting
breath
but
in
a
moment
his
secret
and
his
promises
recurred
to
me
with
inexpressible
anguish
and
i
inwardly
reproached
him
for
having
deferred
his
communication
so
long
as
now
to
preclude
its
ever
being
made
i
can
not
describe
the
keenness
the
burning
and
intolerable
bitterness
of
my
sensation
keen
it
may
well
be
supposed
to
have
been
from
its
having
so
instantaneously
and
forcibly
recurred
at
a
time
when
other
objects
seemed
to
press
upon
my
senses
no
one
who
has
not
felt
what
it
is
to
fall
in
a
moment
from
hope
or
as
i
should
rather
say
from
assured
possession
of
what
his
soul
most
loved
and
desired
into
black
and
interminable
despair
can
imagine
what
was
then
the
state
of
my
mind
the
body
of
my
patient
slided
from
my
nerveless
arms
i
lifted
up
the
eyes
of
rage
and
phrensy
as
if
to
curse
the
author
of
my
being
and
then
fell
helpless
and
immoveable
by
the
side
of
the
stranger
i
felt
him
move
i
heard
him
sigh
i
lifted
up
my
head
and
perceived
stronger
marks
of
life
and
sense
about
him
than
had
yet
displayed
themselves
i
threw
my
arms
about
him
i
pressed
him
to
my
heart
the
emphatical
gesture
i
used
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
magnetical
force
to
rouse
his
dying
powers
with
a
little
assistance
from
me
he
sat
upright
my
assiduity
produced
wonders
it
fortunately
happened
that
this
thicket
was
but
a
half
a
mile
from
my
habitation
and
indeed
was
one
of
the
spots
which
i
had
searched
without
success
the
day
before
about
the
hour
of
sunset
partly
by
leading
and
partly
by
supporting
him
i
restored
my
guest
to
his
former
apartment
he
remained
speechless
or
nearly
so
he
vented
his
sensations
in
sighs
in
inward
and
inarticulate
sounds
and
even
when
he
arrived
at
the
power
of
making
himself
understood
by
words
it
was
only
by
monosyllables
and
half
sentences
that
he
conveyed
to
me
his
meaning
i
now
gave
up
my
time
almost
entirely
to
an
assiduous
attendance
on
the
stranger
every
day
i
expected
to
be
his
last
every
day
was
more
or
less
interspersed
with
symptoms
that
seemed
to
menace
his
instant
dissolution
during
all
this
time
i
remained
in
the
anxious
suspense
of
contending
hope
and
fear
was
it
probable
that
he
would
ever
recover
strength
enough
to
confer
on
me
the
legacy
he
had
announced
the
particulars
of
his
secret
i
knew
not
but
judging
from
what
i
had
heard
of
the
pretences
and
pursuits
of
alchemy
it
was
natural
to
suppose
that
he
had
a
process
to
communicate
which
would
require
on
his
part
considerable
accuracy
of
recollection
as
well
as
the
power
of
delivering
himself
in
a
methodical
and
orderly
discourse
i
was
fortunate
enough
however
to
perceive
after
a
tormenting
and
tedious
crisis
that
he
appeared
to
be
in
a
progress
of
convalescence
and
that
his
strength
both
of
body
and
mind
were
recruited
daily
after
the
lapse
of
a
fortnight
from
the
adventure
of
the
wood
he
one
evening
addressed
me
in
the
following
manner
st
leon
i
have
been
to
blame
i
have
put
you
to
a
sufficient
trial
i
have
received
from
you
every
assistance
and
kindness
that
my
situation
demanded
i
have
imposed
on
you
much
trouble
and
anxiety
i
have
excited
your
expectations
by
announcing
to
you
in
part
what
it
was
in
my
power
to
bestow
and
i
have
finally
risked
the
defrauding
your
hopes
and
your
humanity
of
their
just
reward
do
me
the
justice
however
to
remember
that
i
had
no
presentiment
of
the
event
which
has
so
inauspiciously
come
between
you
and
your
hopes
fool
that
i
was
i
imagined
i
had
suffered
enough
and
that
as
i
had
obtained
a
longer
respite
from
external
persecution
than
i
almost
ever
experienced
i
should
be
permitted
to
spend
the
short
remainder
of
my
days
uninterrupted
i
now
however
look
back
upon
this
last
assault
with
complacency
it
has
cut
off
something
from
the
last
remnant
of
a
life
to
the
close
of
which
i
look
forward
with
inexpressible
longing
at
the
same
time
that
i
am
still
in
prospect
of
obtaining
the
final
wish
of
my
heart
the
stealing
out
of
the
world
unperceived
and
thus
in
some
measure
eluding
the
last
malice
of
my
enemies
after
my
death
i
have
but
one
injunction
to
leave
with
you
the
injunction
of
hercules
to
philoctetes
that
no
inducement
may
move
you
to
betray
to
mortal
man
the
place
in
which
you
shall
have
deposited
my
ashes
bury
them
in
a
spot
which
i
will
describe
to
you
it
is
not
far
and
is
only
recommended
to
me
by
its
almost
inaccessible
situation
and
that
once
done
speak
of
me
and
if
possible
think
of
me
no
more
never
on
any
account
mention
me
or
allude
to
me
never
describe
me
or
relate
the
manner
of
our
meeting
or
the
adventure
which
has
at
length
brought
on
the
desired
close
of
my
existence
believe
me
in
the
feeble
and
helpless
condition
in
which
i
have
spent
the
last
fortnight
your
wishes
and
expectations
have
been
uppermost
in
my
mind
and
there
is
nothing
i
have
felt
with
so
much
compunction
as
the
danger
of
leaving
them
unsatisfied
to
you
perhaps
i
at
present
appear
to
be
rapidly
recovering
i
feel
the
dart
of
death
in
my
vitals
i
know
i
shall
not
live
four
days
it
is
necessary
therefore
that
i
should
finish
without
delay
all
that
remains
for
me
to
finish
i
will
devote
this
night
to
the
arranging
my
thoughts
and
putting
in
order
what
i
have
to
communicate
that
no
mistake
or
omission
may
have
part
in
a
transaction
so
important
come
to
me
morning
i
will
be
prepared
for
as
soon
as
i
heard
this
discourse
and
provided
the
stranger
with
every
thing
he
could
want
during
the
night
i
withdrew
my
heart
was
big
with
expectation
my
thoughts
all
night
were
wild
and
tumultuous
when
the
hour
of
assignation
arrived
i
hastened
along
the
garden
to
the
conscious
that
upon
that
hour
depended
all
the
colour
of
my
future
life
since
the
stranger
had
been
in
his
present
dangerous
condition
the
door
was
not
bolted
it
was
only
locked
the
key
was
in
my
possession
and
remained
night
and
day
attached
to
my
person
i
opened
the
door
i
panted
and
was
breathless
i
immediately
saw
that
the
stranger
had
undergone
some
great
alteration
for
the
worse
he
had
suffered
a
sort
of
paralytic
affection
he
lifted
up
his
face
as
i
entered
it
was
paler
than
i
had
ever
seen
it
he
shook
his
head
mournfully
and
intimated
by
signs
the
disappointment
which
this
morning
must
witness
he
was
speechless
fate
fate
exclaimed
i
in
an
agony
of
despair
am
i
to
be
for
ever
baffled
is
the
prize
so
much
longed
for
and
so
ardently
expected
at
last
to
escape
me
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
how
much
these
successive
endless
disappointments
increased
my
impatience
and
magnified
in
my
eyes
the
donation
i
sought
the
whole
of
this
and
the
following
day
the
stranger
remained
speechless
the
third
day
in
the
morning
he
murmured
many
sounds
but
in
a
manner
so
excessively
inarticulate
that
i
was
not
able
to
understand
one
word
in
six
that
he
said
i
recollected
his
prediction
that
he
should
die
on
the
fourth
day
the
fever
of
my
soul
was
at
its
height
mortal
sinews
and
fibres
could
sustain
no
more
if
the
stranger
had
died
thus
it
is
most
probable
that
i
should
have
thrown
myself
in
anguish
and
rage
upon
his
corpse
and
have
expired
in
the
same
hour
in
the
evening
of
the
third
day
i
visited
him
again
he
had
thrown
his
robe
around
him
and
was
sitting
on
the
side
of
his
couch
the
evening
sun
shot
his
last
beams
over
the
there
were
about
eight
inches
between
the
shutter
and
the
top
of
the
window
and
some
branches
of
vines
with
their
grapes
already
ripe
broke
the
uniformity
of
the
light
the
side
of
the
couch
faced
the
west
and
the
beams
played
upon
the
old
man
s
countenance
i
had
never
seen
it
so
serene
the
light
already
softened
by
the
decline
of
day
gave
it
a
peculiar
animation
and
a
smile
that
seemed
to
betoken
renovation
and
the
youth
of
angels
sat
upon
it
he
beckoned
me
to
approach
i
placed
myself
beside
him
on
the
couch
he
took
my
hand
in
his
and
leaned
his
face
towards
me
i
shall
never
witness
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
again
were
the
first
words
he
uttered
i
immediately
perceived
that
he
spoke
more
collectedly
and
with
better
articulation
than
at
any
time
since
the
paralytic
stroke
still
however
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
develop
his
words
but
i
wound
up
every
faculty
of
my
frame
to
catch
them
and
assisted
as
i
was
by
the
habit
of
listening
to
his
speech
for
many
weeks
which
during
the
whole
of
that
time
had
never
been
distinct
i
was
successful
enough
to
make
out
his
entire
discourse
it
continued
though
with
various
interruptions
for
more
than
half
an
hour
he
explained
with
wonderful
accuracy
the
whole
of
his
secrets
and
the
process
with
which
they
were
connected
my
soul
was
roused
to
the
utmost
stretch
of
attention
and
astonishment
his
secrets
as
i
have
already
announced
in
the
commencement
of
this
history
consisted
of
two
principal
particulars
the
art
of
multiplying
gold
and
the
power
of
living
for
ever
the
detail
of
these
secrets
i
omit
into
that
i
am
forbidden
to
enter
my
design
in
writing
this
narrative
i
have
said
is
not
to
teach
the
art
of
which
i
am
in
possession
but
to
describe
the
adventures
it
produced
to
me
the
more
i
listened
the
more
my
astonishment
grew
i
looked
at
the
old
man
before
me
i
observed
the
wretchedness
of
his
appearance
the
meanness
of
his
attire
his
apparent
old
age
his
extreme
feebleness
the
characters
of
approaching
death
that
were
written
on
his
countenance
after
what
i
had
just
heard
i
surveyed
these
things
with
a
sensation
of
novelty
as
if
i
had
never
remarked
them
in
him
before
i
said
to
myself
is
this
the
man
that
possesses
mines
of
wealth
inexhaustible
and
the
capacity
of
living
for
ever
observing
that
he
had
finished
his
discourse
i
addressed
to
him
these
words
by
a
sort
of
uncontrollable
impulse
and
with
all
the
vehemence
of
unsated
and
insuppressible
curiosity
tell
me
i
adjure
you
by
the
living
god
what
use
have
you
made
of
these
extraordinary
gifts
and
with
what
events
has
that
use
been
attended
as
i
spoke
thus
the
countenance
of
the
old
man
underwent
a
surprising
change
its
serenity
vanished
his
eyes
rolled
with
an
expression
of
agony
and
he
answered
me
thus
be
silent
leon
how
often
must
i
tell
you
that
no
single
incident
of
my
story
shall
ever
be
repeated
have
i
no
claim
upon
your
forbearance
can
you
be
barbarous
and
inhuman
enough
to
disturb
my
last
scene
with
these
bitter
recollections
i
was
silent
this
is
all
that
is
material
that
passed
at
our
interview
the
stranger
died
the
next
day
and
was
buried
according
to
his
instructions
chapter
xiv
from
the
moment
of
my
last
interview
with
the
stranger
i
was
another
creature
my
thoughts
incessantly
rolled
upon
his
communications
they
filled
me
with
astonishment
and
joy
almost
to
bursting
i
was
unable
to
contain
myself
i
was
unable
to
remain
in
any
posture
or
any
place
i
could
scarcely
command
myself
sufficiently
to
perform
the
last
duties
to
his
body
in
the
manner
he
had
directed
i
paced
with
eager
step
the
sands
of
the
lake
i
climbed
the
neighbouring
hills
and
then
descended
with
inconceivable
rapidity
to
the
vales
below
i
traced
with
fierce
impatience
the
endless
mazes
of
the
wood
in
which
i
so
hardly
recovered
my
bewildered
guest
the
uninterruptedness
and
celerity
of
bodily
motion
seemed
to
communicate
some
ease
to
my
swelling
heart
yet
there
was
one
thing
i
wanted
i
wanted
some
friendly
bosom
into
which
to
pour
out
my
feelings
and
thus
by
participation
to
render
my
transports
balsamic
and
tolerable
but
this
was
for
ever
denied
me
no
human
ear
must
ever
be
astonished
with
the
story
of
my
endowments
and
my
privileges
i
may
whisper
it
to
the
woods
and
the
waters
but
not
in
the
face
of
man
not
only
am
i
bound
to
suppress
the
knowledge
of
the
important
secret
i
possess
but
even
the
feelings
the
ruminations
the
visions
that
are
for
ever
floating
in
my
soul
it
is
but
a
vain
and
frivolous
distinction
upon
which
i
act
when
i
commit
to
this
paper
my
history
and
not
the
science
which
is
its
the
reason
why
the
science
may
not
be
divulged
is
obvious
exhaustless
wealth
if
communicated
to
all
men
would
be
but
an
exhaustless
heap
of
pebbles
and
dust
and
nature
will
not
admit
her
everlasting
laws
to
be
so
abrogated
as
they
would
be
by
rendering
the
whole
race
of
sublunary
man
immortal
but
i
am
bound
as
far
as
possible
not
only
to
hide
my
secrets
but
to
conceal
that
i
have
any
to
hide
senseless
paper
be
thou
at
least
my
confidant
to
thee
i
may
impart
what
my
soul
spurns
the
task
to
suppress
the
human
mind
insatiably
thirsts
for
a
confidant
and
a
friend
it
is
no
matter
that
these
pages
shall
never
he
surveyed
by
other
eyes
than
mine
they
afford
at
least
the
semblance
of
communication
and
the
unburthening
of
the
mind
and
i
will
press
the
illusion
fondly
and
for
ever
to
my
heart
to
return
to
the
explanation
of
my
feelings
immediately
after
receiving
possession
of
my
grand
acquisition
for
without
that
explanation
the
spirit
and
meaning
of
my
subsequent
narrative
will
scarcely
be
sufficiently
apprehended
happy
happy
happy
man
exclaimed
i
in
the
midst
of
my
wanderings
and
reveries
wealth
thy
power
is
unbounded
and
inconceivable
all
men
bow
down
to
thee
the
most
stubborn
will
is
by
thee
rendered
pliant
as
wax
all
obstacles
are
melted
down
and
dissolved
by
the
ardour
of
thy
beams
the
man
that
possesses
thee
finds
every
path
level
before
him
and
every
creature
burning
to
anticipate
his
wishes
but
if
these
are
the
advantages
that
wealth
imparts
to
such
as
possess
only
those
scanty
portions
which
states
and
nations
allow
to
the
richest
how
enviable
must
his
condition
be
whose
wealth
is
literally
exhaustless
and
infinite
he
possesses
really
the
blessing
which
priestcraft
and
superstition
have
lyingly
pronounced
upon
the
charitable
he
may
give
away
the
revenues
of
princes
and
not
be
the
poorer
he
possesses
the
attribute
which
we
are
accustomed
to
ascribe
to
the
creator
of
the
universe
he
may
say
to
a
man
be
rich
and
he
is
rich
he
can
bestow
with
equal
facility
the
smallest
gifts
and
the
greatest
palaces
as
if
they
were
the
native
exhalations
of
the
soil
rise
out
of
the
earth
at
his
bidding
he
holds
the
fate
of
nations
and
of
the
world
in
his
hand
he
can
remove
forests
and
level
mountains
drain
marshes
extend
canals
turn
the
course
of
rivers
and
shut
up
the
sea
with
doors
he
can
assign
to
every
individual
in
a
nation
the
task
he
pleases
can
improve
agriculture
and
establish
manufactures
can
found
schools
and
hospitals
and
infirmaries
and
universities
he
can
study
the
genius
of
every
man
and
enable
every
man
to
pursue
the
bent
of
his
mind
poets
and
philosophers
will
be
fostered
the
sublimest
flights
of
genius
be
produced
and
the
most
admirable
discoveries
effected
under
his
auspicious
patronage
the
whole
world
are
his
servants
and
he
if
his
temper
be
noble
and
upright
will
be
the
servant
of
the
whole
world
nay
it
can
not
happen
otherwise
he
has
as
few
temptations
to
obliquity
as
omnipotence
itself
weakness
and
want
are
the
parents
of
vice
but
he
possesses
every
thing
he
can
not
better
his
situation
no
man
can
come
into
rivalship
or
competition
with
him
i
thank
god
i
have
known
the
extremes
of
poverty
and
therefore
am
properly
qualified
to
enjoy
my
present
happiness
i
have
felt
a
reverse
of
fortune
driving
me
in
one
instance
to
insanity
in
another
instance
threatening
to
destroy
me
my
wife
and
children
together
with
the
plague
of
hunger
my
heart
has
been
racked
with
remorse
because
by
my
guilt
and
folly
my
children
have
been
deprived
of
the
distinction
and
rank
to
which
they
were
born
and
plunged
in
remediless
obscurity
heaven
has
seen
my
sufferings
and
at
length
has
graciously
said
it
is
because
i
have
endured
more
than
man
ever
endured
from
the
privation
of
fortune
god
in
his
justice
has
reserved
for
me
this
secret
of
the
transmutation
of
metals
i
can
never
again
fall
into
that
wretchedness
by
which
my
understanding
was
subverted
and
my
heart
was
from
this
part
of
the
legacy
of
the
stranger
my
mind
reverted
to
the
other
i
surveyed
my
limbs
all
the
joints
and
articulations
of
my
frame
with
curiosity
and
astonishment
what
exclaimed
i
these
limbs
this
complicated
but
brittle
frame
shall
last
for
ever
no
disease
shall
attack
it
no
pain
shall
seize
it
death
shall
withhold
from
it
for
ever
his
abhorred
grasp
perpetual
vigour
perpetual
activity
perpetual
youth
shall
take
up
their
abode
with
me
time
shall
generate
in
me
no
decay
shall
not
add
a
wrinkle
to
my
brow
or
convert
a
hair
of
my
head
to
grey
this
body
was
formed
to
die
this
edifice
to
crumble
into
dust
the
principles
of
corruption
and
mortality
are
mixed
up
in
every
atom
of
my
frame
but
for
me
the
laws
of
nature
are
suspended
the
eternal
wheels
of
the
universe
roll
backward
i
am
destined
to
be
triumphant
over
fate
and
time
months
years
cycles
centuries
to
me
all
these
are
but
as
indivisible
moments
i
shall
never
become
old
i
shall
always
be
as
it
were
in
the
porch
and
infancy
of
existence
no
lapse
of
years
shall
subtract
any
thing
from
my
future
duration
i
was
born
under
louis
the
twelfth
the
life
of
francis
the
first
now
threatens
a
speedy
termination
he
will
be
gathered
to
his
fathers
and
henry
his
son
will
succeed
him
but
what
are
princes
and
kings
and
generations
of
men
to
me
i
shall
become
familiar
with
the
rise
and
fall
of
empires
in
a
little
while
the
very
name
of
france
my
country
will
perish
from
the
face
of
the
earth
and
men
will
dispute
about
the
situation
of
paris
as
they
dispute
about
the
site
of
ancient
nineveh
and
babylon
and
troy
yet
i
shall
still
be
young
i
shall
take
my
most
distant
posterity
by
the
hand
i
shall
accompany
them
in
their
career
and
when
they
are
worn
out
and
exhausted
shall
shut
up
the
tomb
over
them
and
set
there
was
something
however
in
this
part
of
my
speculation
that
did
not
entirely
please
me
methought
the
race
of
mankind
looked
too
insignificant
in
my
eyes
i
felt
a
degree
of
uneasiness
at
the
immeasurable
distance
that
was
put
between
me
and
the
rest
of
my
species
i
found
myself
alone
in
the
world
must
i
for
ever
live
without
a
companion
a
friend
any
one
with
whom
i
can
associate
upon
equal
terms
with
whom
i
can
have
a
community
of
sensations
and
feelings
and
hopes
and
desires
and
fears
i
experienced
something
less
than
a
wish
yet
a
something
very
capable
of
damping
my
joy
that
i
also
were
subject
to
mortality
i
could
have
been
well
content
to
be
partaker
with
a
race
of
immortals
but
i
was
not
satisfied
to
be
single
in
this
respect
i
was
not
pleased
to
recollect
how
trivial
would
appear
to
me
those
concerns
of
a
few
years
about
which
the
passions
of
men
are
so
eagerly
occupied
i
did
not
like
the
deadness
of
heart
that
seemed
to
threaten
me
i
began
to
be
afraid
of
vacancy
and
torpor
and
that
my
life
would
become
too
uniformly
quiet
nor
did
it
sufficiently
console
me
to
recollect
that
as
one
set
of
friends
died
off
the
stage
another
race
would
arise
to
be
substituted
in
their
stead
i
felt
that
human
affections
and
passions
are
not
made
of
this
transferable
stuff
and
that
we
can
love
nothing
truly
unless
we
devote
ourselves
to
it
heart
and
soul
and
our
life
is
as
it
were
bound
up
in
the
object
of
our
attachment
it
was
worse
when
i
recollected
my
wife
and
my
children
when
i
considered
for
the
first
time
that
they
were
now
in
a
manner
nothing
to
me
i
felt
a
sensation
that
might
be
said
to
mount
to
anguish
how
can
a
man
attach
himself
to
any
thing
when
he
comes
to
consider
it
as
the
mere
plaything
and
amusement
of
the
moment
in
this
statement
however
i
am
not
accurate
habit
is
more
potent
than
any
theoretical
speculation
past
times
had
attached
me
deeply
irrevocably
to
all
the
members
of
my
family
but
i
felt
that
i
should
survive
them
all
they
would
die
one
by
one
and
leave
me
alone
i
should
drop
into
their
graves
the
still
renewing
tear
of
anguish
in
that
tomb
would
my
heart
be
buried
never
never
through
the
countless
ages
of
eternity
should
i
form
another
attachment
in
the
happy
age
of
delusion
happy
and
auspicious
at
least
to
the
cultivation
of
the
passions
when
i
felt
that
i
also
was
a
mortal
i
was
capable
of
a
community
of
sentiments
and
a
going
forth
of
the
heart
but
how
could
i
an
immortal
hope
ever
hereafter
to
feel
a
serious
an
elevating
and
expansive
passion
for
the
ephemeron
of
an
hour
as
the
first
tumult
of
my
thoughts
subsided
i
began
as
is
usual
with
persons
whose
minds
are
turned
loose
in
the
search
of
visionary
happiness
to
picture
to
myself
more
steadily
and
with
greater
minuteness
the
objects
i
would
resolve
early
to
accomplish
i
would
in
the
first
place
return
to
france
my
adored
country
the
residence
of
my
ancestors
whose
annals
they
had
adorned
whose
plains
had
witnessed
their
heroic
feats
and
whose
earth
enclosed
their
ashes
to
france
i
was
endeared
by
every
tie
that
binds
the
human
heart
her
language
had
been
the
prattle
of
my
infancy
her
national
manners
and
temper
were
twined
with
the
fibres
of
my
constitution
and
could
not
be
rooted
out
i
felt
that
every
frenchman
that
lived
was
my
brother
banishment
had
only
caused
these
prejudices
to
strike
their
tendrils
deeper
in
my
heart
i
knew
not
that
i
should
finally
limit
my
abode
to
france
a
man
who
like
melchisedec
is
without
end
of
life
may
well
consider
himself
as
being
also
like
him
without
father
without
mother
and
without
but
at
all
events
i
would
first
fix
my
children
who
did
not
participate
in
my
privileges
in
their
native
soil
i
would
reside
there
myself
at
least
till
they
were
fully
disposed
of
and
till
the
admirable
partner
of
the
last
seventeen
years
of
my
life
had
resigned
her
breath
i
would
immediately
repurchase
the
property
of
my
ancestors
which
had
been
so
distressfully
resigned
the
exile
should
return
from
his
seven
years
banishment
in
triumph
and
splendour
i
would
return
to
the
court
of
my
old
patron
and
friend
the
gallant
francis
and
present
to
him
my
boy
the
future
representative
of
my
family
now
one
year
older
than
i
had
been
at
the
field
of
the
cloth
of
gold
though
an
exile
from
my
country
i
had
not
been
an
inattentive
witness
of
her
fortunes
the
year
fifteen
hundred
and
was
a
remarkable
and
interesting
year
in
the
history
of
france
the
endless
animosities
of
francis
and
the
emperor
had
broken
out
with
new
fury
about
two
years
before
in
the
spring
of
the
present
year
the
count
d
anguien
had
won
a
battle
in
piedmont
in
which
ten
thousand
imperialists
were
left
dead
upon
the
field
and
which
might
be
considered
as
having
at
length
effaced
the
defeat
of
pavia
in
the
same
part
of
the
world
nineteen
years
before
the
moment
it
had
been
announced
that
a
battle
was
resolved
on
the
young
nobility
of
france
with
their
characteristic
ardour
had
hurried
to
the
scene
and
the
court
of
paris
was
in
an
instant
as
it
were
turned
into
a
desert
on
the
other
hand
the
emperor
and
the
king
of
england
had
concerted
for
the
same
season
a
formidable
plan
of
attack
against
our
northern
frontier
with
an
army
of
thousand
men
respectively
the
one
on
the
side
of
champagne
and
the
other
of
picardy
they
agreed
to
advance
directly
into
the
heart
of
the
kingdom
and
to
unite
their
forces
in
the
neighbourhood
of
paris
the
last
intelligence
that
had
reached
me
was
that
château
thierry
about
twenty
leagues
from
the
metropolis
was
in
the
hands
of
the
emperor
and
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
capital
filled
with
consternation
were
seeking
their
safety
by
flight
in
every
direction
these
circumstances
had
passed
idly
by
me
and
left
little
impression
so
long
as
i
considered
myself
as
an
obscure
peasant
cut
off
for
ever
from
the
bosom
of
my
country
but
vested
with
the
extraordinary
powers
now
intrusted
to
me
the
case
was
altered
i
felt
even
a
greater
interest
in
my
sovereign
now
pressed
down
with
disease
and
calamity
yet
retaining
the
original
alacrity
and
confidence
of
his
soul
than
i
had
done
when
i
saw
him
in
all
the
pride
of
youth
and
all
the
splendour
of
prosperity
i
was
anxious
that
charles
should
now
enter
into
his
service
and
i
determined
once
again
to
assume
the
cuirass
and
the
falchion
that
i
might
be
the
instructor
of
his
youth
and
his
pattern
in
feats
of
war
i
resolved
that
my
bred
in
obscurity
among
woods
and
mountains
should
burst
with
sudden
splendour
upon
his
countrymen
and
prove
in
the
field
his
noble
blood
and
generous
strain
i
also
proposed
to
myself
both
out
of
sympathy
for
my
king
and
to
give
greater
éclat
to
my
son
s
entrance
into
life
to
replenish
with
my
treasures
the
empty
coffers
of
france
and
thus
to
furnish
what
at
this
period
seemed
to
be
the
main
spring
upon
which
the
fortune
of
war
depended
with
the
advantages
i
could
afford
him
the
career
of
charles
could
not
fail
to
be
rapid
and
illustrious
and
he
would
undoubtedly
obtain
the
staff
of
constable
of
france
the
possessor
of
which
montmorency
was
now
in
disgrace
i
would
marry
my
daughters
to
such
of
the
young
nobility
as
i
should
find
most
distinguished
in
talents
and
spotless
in
character
when
by
the
death
of
her
i
most
loved
my
affections
should
be
weaned
from
my
country
and
the
scenes
to
which
i
had
been
accustomed
were
rendered
painful
and
distressing
i
would
then
set
out
upon
my
travels
i
would
travel
with
such
splendour
and
profusion
of
expense
for
this
though
mortified
in
me
by
a
reverse
of
many
years
duration
continued
to
be
the
foible
of
my
heart
as
should
supersede
the
necessity
of
letters
of
recommendation
and
secure
me
a
favourable
reception
wherever
i
appeared
i
might
spend
a
life
in
a
manner
in
every
country
that
was
fortunate
enough
to
allure
my
stay
spreading
improvements
dispensing
blessings
and
causing
all
distress
and
calamity
to
vanish
from
before
me
chapter
xv
my
mind
was
occupied
in
these
and
similar
reveries
for
several
weeks
after
the
death
of
the
stranger
my
wife
and
children
had
hoped
after
that
event
that
i
should
have
returned
to
the
habits
which
had
pervaded
the
last
six
years
of
my
existence
and
which
they
had
felt
so
eminently
productive
of
gratification
and
delight
in
this
hope
they
found
themselves
deceived
my
domestic
character
was
for
the
present
at
least
wholly
destroyed
i
had
a
subject
of
contemplation
that
did
not
admit
of
a
partaker
and
from
this
subject
i
could
not
withdraw
my
thoughts
so
much
as
for
an
instant
i
had
no
pleasure
but
in
that
retirement
where
i
could
be
unseen
and
unheard
by
any
human
eye
or
ear
if
at
any
time
i
was
compelled
to
join
the
domestic
circle
i
despatched
the
occasion
that
brought
me
there
as
speedily
as
possible
and
even
while
i
remained
in
it
was
silent
and
absent
engrossed
with
my
own
contemplations
and
heedless
and
unobservant
of
every
thing
around
me
my
abstraction
was
not
however
so
entire
as
to
prevent
me
from
sometimes
stealing
in
a
sort
of
momentary
interregnum
of
thought
in
that
pause
where
the
mind
rests
upon
the
chain
already
passed
over
and
seems
passively
to
wait
for
the
sequel
a
glance
at
my
family
i
looked
at
them
without
knowing
what
it
was
that
i
did
and
without
the
intention
to
notice
what
i
saw
yet
even
in
this
state
of
mental
abstraction
visible
objects
will
sometimes
succeed
in
making
their
impression
i
perceived
that
my
wife
and
children
suffered
from
my
behaviour
i
remarked
a
general
air
of
disconsolateness
and
a
mild
unexpostulating
submission
to
what
nevertheless
the
heart
deeply
deplored
they
did
not
presume
to
interrupt
me
they
did
not
by
prying
and
inquisitive
speeches
attempt
to
extort
from
me
the
secret
of
the
alteration
they
saw
but
it
was
manifest
they
conceived
some
great
and
radical
calamity
had
poisoned
the
heart
of
our
domestic
joy
it
was
these
symptoms
thus
remarked
by
me
that
first
roused
me
from
the
inebriation
of
my
new
condition
i
was
compelled
to
suspect
that
while
i
revelled
in
visions
of
future
enjoyment
i
was
inflicting
severe
and
unmerited
pains
on
those
i
loved
it
was
necessary
if
i
valued
their
happiness
that
i
should
descend
from
the
clouds
of
speculation
and
fancy
and
enter
upon
the
world
of
realities
but
here
i
first
found
a
difficulty
to
which
during
the
reign
of
my
intoxication
i
had
been
utterly
insensible
i
was
rich
i
could
raise
my
family
as
far
as
the
power
of
money
extended
money
which
may
in
some
sense
be
styled
the
empress
of
the
world
to
what
heights
i
pleased
i
had
hitherto
committed
the
fault
so
common
to
projectors
of
looking
only
to
ultimate
objects
and
great
resting
places
and
neglecting
to
consider
the
steps
between
this
was
an
omission
of
high
importance
every
thing
in
the
world
is
conducted
by
gradual
process
this
seems
to
be
the
great
principle
of
harmony
in
the
universe
nothing
is
abrupt
one
thing
is
so
blended
and
softened
into
another
that
it
is
impossible
to
say
where
the
former
ends
and
the
latter
begins
this
remark
is
fully
applicable
to
the
situation
which
was
now
before
me
yesterday
i
was
poor
i
was
possessor
of
treasures
inexhaustible
how
was
this
alteration
to
be
announced
to
dissipate
the
revenues
of
princes
to
purchase
immense
estates
to
launch
into
costly
establishments
are
tasks
to
which
the
most
vulgar
mind
is
equal
but
no
man
stands
alone
in
the
world
without
all
trace
of
what
he
has
been
and
with
no
one
near
that
thinks
himself
entitled
to
scrutinise
his
proceedings
and
his
condition
least
of
all
was
this
my
case
i
was
bound
to
certain
other
persons
by
the
most
sacred
obligations
i
could
not
separate
myself
from
them
i
could
not
render
myself
a
mere
enigma
in
their
eyes
though
in
the
language
of
the
world
the
head
of
my
family
they
were
my
natural
censors
and
judges
i
was
accountable
to
them
for
my
conduct
it
was
my
duty
paramount
to
all
other
duties
to
stand
as
a
fair
upright
and
honourable
character
in
their
estimation
if
these
remarks
be
true
taken
in
a
general
view
they
are
much
more
so
when
applied
to
my
particular
case
there
are
men
who
live
in
the
midst
of
their
families
like
an
eastern
despot
surrounded
with
his
subjects
they
are
something
too
sacred
to
be
approached
their
conduct
is
not
to
be
reasoned
upon
the
amount
of
their
receipts
and
disbursements
is
not
to
be
inspected
their
resources
are
unknown
no
one
must
say
to
them
what
dost
thou
or
why
hast
thou
thus
conducted
thyself
even
these
persons
will
not
escape
the
tax
to
which
all
men
are
liable
they
can
not
kill
the
general
spirit
of
enquiry
the
mystery
in
which
they
wrap
themselves
will
often
serve
as
an
additional
stimulus
they
will
finally
encounter
the
judgment
and
verdict
of
all
for
myself
i
had
lived
in
the
midst
of
my
family
upon
a
system
of
paternal
and
amicable
commerce
i
had
suffered
too
deeply
from
a
momentary
season
of
separation
and
mystery
not
to
have
been
induced
to
renounce
it
decisively
and
for
ever
firm
however
as
i
had
imagined
my
renunciation
to
have
been
i
was
now
thrown
back
upon
what
i
had
most
avoided
i
had
a
secret
source
of
advantage
the
effects
of
which
were
to
be
participated
by
those
i
loved
while
the
spring
was
to
remain
for
ever
unknown
what
i
most
sought
upon
this
occasion
was
that
my
family
should
share
my
good
fortune
and
at
the
same
time
be
prevented
from
so
much
as
suspecting
that
there
was
any
thing
mysterious
connected
with
it
to
effect
this
i
presently
conceived
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
sacrifice
the
sudden
and
instantaneous
prosperity
i
had
proposed
to
myself
and
introduce
the
reverse
of
our
condition
by
slow
and
as
far
as
possible
insensible
degrees
one
thing
on
which
i
determined
preparatory
to
the
other
measures
i
had
in
view
was
to
remove
from
my
present
habitation
and
take
up
my
residence
for
a
time
in
the
city
of
constance
in
the
cottage
of
the
mountains
it
was
impossible
to
make
any
material
alteration
in
my
establishment
my
property
was
of
the
narrowest
extent
nor
would
it
be
easily
practicable
in
a
country
the
inhabitants
of
which
were
accustomed
to
a
humble
allotment
considerably
to
enlarge
it
my
house
was
frugal
if
not
mean
and
unless
it
were
first
pulled
down
and
built
over
again
the
idea
of
introducing
servants
equipage
or
splendour
into
it
would
be
absurd
my
design
was
not
to
make
a
long
abode
where
i
now
was
but
as
soon
as
my
family
should
be
sufficiently
prepared
for
the
transition
to
return
to
my
native
country
i
believed
in
the
mean
time
that
in
the
capital
of
the
bishopric
where
my
name
was
scarcely
remembered
by
a
single
individual
i
should
be
more
at
liberty
to
proceed
as
circumstances
suggested
than
in
my
present
rural
situation
where
every
neighbour
regarded
himself
as
vested
with
a
sort
of
inquisitorial
power
over
all
around
him
to
account
for
this
measure
to
my
family
i
felt
it
incumbent
on
me
to
confess
to
them
a
certain
pecuniary
acquisition
the
story
that
most
readily
suggested
itself
was
that
of
the
stranger
having
left
behind
him
a
certain
sum
of
which
he
made
a
donation
to
me
this
though
in
the
plain
and
direct
sense
of
the
terms
it
were
false
yet
in
its
spirit
bore
a
certain
resemblance
to
the
truth
and
with
that
resemblance
in
spite
of
the
rigid
adherence
to
veracity
that
first
ornament
of
a
gentleman
that
most
essential
prerequisite
to
the
regard
and
affection
of
others
which
i
had
hitherto
maintained
i
was
induced
to
content
myself
what
could
i
do
i
was
compelled
to
account
for
appearances
i
was
forbidden
by
the
most
solemn
injunctions
to
unfold
the
truth
i
should
indeed
have
felt
little
complacence
in
the
disclosure
i
should
have
been
reluctant
to
announce
a
circumstance
which
as
i
began
to
feel
introduced
a
permanent
difference
and
separation
between
me
and
my
family
the
sum
at
which
i
fixed
the
legacy
of
the
stranger
was
three
thousand
crowns
i
was
not
inattentive
to
the
future
i
should
have
been
glad
by
my
present
account
to
have
furnished
a
more
ample
solution
for
circumstances
which
might
occur
hereafter
but
some
regard
was
due
to
probability
an
unknown
a
solitary
man
broken
with
age
who
arrived
on
foot
and
who
declined
all
aid
and
attendance
must
not
be
represented
as
possessing
mines
of
treasure
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
prevail
on
myself
to
break
my
story
to
the
inhabitants
of
my
cottage
as
the
time
approached
when
i
was
to
bid
an
everlasting
farewell
to
rural
obscurity
and
a
humble
station
they
seemed
to
adorn
themselves
in
new
charms
i
was
like
the
son
of
a
king
who
had
hitherto
been
told
by
his
attendants
that
he
was
a
mere
villager
and
who
while
his
youthful
imagination
is
dazzled
by
the
splendour
that
awaits
him
yet
looks
back
with
a
wistful
eye
upon
his
mirthful
sports
his
former
companions
and
the
simple
charms
of
her
who
first
obtained
his
guileless
love
i
announced
my
acquisition
and
my
purpose
with
a
faltering
tongue
and
a
beating
heart
i
could
perceive
that
my
tale
produced
few
emotions
of
pleasure
in
those
who
heard
it
julia
and
her
mother
especially
were
warmly
attached
to
their
retirement
and
the
scenes
which
had
witnessed
so
many
pleasurable
incidents
and
emotions
chagrin
in
spite
of
themselves
made
a
transient
abode
upon
their
countenances
but
the
unresisting
mildness
of
the
one
and
the
considerate
attachment
of
the
other
prevented
for
the
present
their
sensations
from
breaking
out
into
words
the
feelings
however
that
they
consigned
to
silence
did
not
entirely
escape
the
notice
of
the
lively
little
marguerite
she
sympathised
with
them
probably
without
being
aware
that
they
were
sad
she
came
towards
me
and
with
much
anxiety
in
her
enquiring
face
asked
why
we
must
go
away
from
the
cottage
if
i
had
got
some
money
i
might
go
to
the
town
and
buy
sweetmeats
and
ribands
and
new
clothes
and
a
hundred
more
pretty
things
and
bring
them
home
for
her
part
she
should
be
better
pleased
to
put
on
her
finery
and
make
her
feast
in
the
pretty
old
now
she
was
again
permitted
to
go
and
play
in
it
than
in
a
palace
all
stuck
over
with
emeralds
and
rubies
her
mother
wiped
away
a
tear
at
the
innocent
speech
of
her
darling
kissed
her
and
bid
her
go
and
feed
the
hen
and
her
chickens
charles
was
the
only
one
in
whom
i
could
observe
any
pleasure
at
my
intelligence
he
was
not
as
yet
skilful
enough
to
calculate
the
advantages
that
three
thousand
crowns
could
purchase
but
i
could
see
joy
sparkle
in
his
eyes
as
i
announced
my
intention
of
bidding
adieu
to
retirement
and
taking
up
my
rest
in
the
capital
of
the
district
his
veins
swelled
with
the
blood
of
his
ancestors
his
mind
was
inured
to
the
contemplation
of
their
prowess
already
sixteen
years
of
age
he
had
secretly
burned
to
go
forth
into
the
world
to
behold
the
manners
of
his
species
and
to
establish
for
himself
a
claim
to
some
rank
in
their
estimation
he
had
pined
in
thought
at
the
mediocrity
of
our
circumstances
and
the
apparent
impossibility
of
emerging
for
he
regarded
the
duty
of
contributing
his
labour
to
the
subsistence
of
the
family
as
the
first
of
all
obligations
and
the
more
the
bent
of
his
spirit
struggled
against
it
the
more
resolutely
he
set
himself
to
comply
the
rest
of
the
family
were
no
sooner
retired
than
marguerite
finding
in
what
i
had
just
announced
to
all
an
occasion
from
the
use
of
which
she
could
not
excuse
herself
took
this
opportunity
of
unburthening
the
grief
which
had
long
been
accumulating
in
her
mind
st
leon
said
she
listen
kindly
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
to
you
and
assure
yourself
that
i
am
actuated
by
no
spleen
resentment
or
but
by
the
truest
affection
i
perceive
i
have
lost
in
your
apprehension
the
right
of
advising
you
i
am
no
longer
the
partner
of
your
counsels
i
am
no
longer
the
confident
of
your
thoughts
you
communicate
nothing
but
what
you
can
not
suppress
and
that
you
communicate
to
your
whole
family
assembled
heaven
knows
how
dear
to
me
is
every
individual
of
that
family
but
my
love
for
them
does
not
hide
from
me
what
is
due
to
myself
i
know
that
a
husband
who
felt
as
a
husband
ought
and
give
me
leave
to
say
as
i
have
deserved
you
should
feel
towards
me
could
not
act
as
you
have
acted
you
must
excuse
my
reminding
you
of
some
things
which
you
seem
to
have
forgotten
i
would
not
mention
them
if
they
had
not
been
forgotten
when
they
ought
to
have
been
remembered
i
have
lived
seventeen
years
with
you
my
whole
study
had
been
your
advantage
and
pleasure
have
you
any
thing
to
reproach
me
with
point
out
to
me
if
in
any
thing
i
could
have
added
to
your
pleasure
and
have
neglected
it
what
i
have
done
has
not
been
the
ceremonious
discharge
of
a
duty
it
has
been
the
pure
emanation
of
an
attachment
that
knew
no
bounds
i
have
passed
with
you
through
good
fortune
and
ill
fortune
when
we
were
rich
i
entered
with
my
whole
heart
into
your
pleasures
because
they
were
yours
when
we
were
poor
i
endured
every
hardship
without
a
murmur
i
watched
by
you
i
consoled
you
i
reconciled
you
to
yourself
i
do
not
mean
to
make
a
merit
of
all
this
no
reginald
i
could
not
have
acted
otherwise
if
i
would
do
me
the
justice
to
recollect
that
i
have
not
been
a
complaining
or
irritable
companion
in
all
our
adversities
in
the
loss
of
fortune
and
the
bitter
consequences
of
that
loss
i
never
uttered
a
reproachful
word
what
poverty
sorrow
hunger
and
famine
never
extorted
from
me
you
have
at
length
wrung
from
my
bleeding
heart
leon
i
have
known
your
in
no
former
instance
has
your
affection
or
your
confidence
been
alienated
from
me
and
that
consoled
me
for
all
the
rest
but
now
for
three
months
the
case
has
been
entirely
altered
you
have
during
all
that
time
been
busy
pensive
and
agitated
but
i
have
been
as
much
a
stranger
to
your
meditations
as
if
i
had
never
been
accustomed
to
be
their
depository
you
have
not
scrupled
to
inflict
a
wound
upon
me
that
no
subsequent
change
will
ever
be
able
to
cicatrise
nor
indeed
do
i
see
any
likelihood
of
a
change
you
announce
our
removal
to
constance
what
we
are
to
do
next
with
what
views
or
for
what
purpose
i
am
ignorant
i
have
made
my
election
my
heart
is
formed
for
affection
and
must
always
feel
an
uneasy
void
and
desolation
without
it
if
you
had
thus
robbed
me
of
your
attachment
in
an
early
period
of
our
intercourse
i
know
not
upon
what
extremity
my
disappointment
and
anguish
might
have
driven
me
they
are
harder
to
bear
now
but
i
submit
it
is
too
late
either
for
relief
or
remedy
what
remains
of
my
powers
and
my
strength
i
owe
to
my
children
i
will
not
seduce
them
from
their
father
they
may
be
benefited
by
his
purse
or
his
understanding
though
like
me
they
should
be
deprived
of
his
affection
you
may
be
their
friend
when
i
am
no
more
i
feel
that
this
will
not
last
long
i
feel
that
the
main
link
that
bound
me
to
existence
can
not
be
snapped
and
thus
snapped
by
unkindness
worse
than
death
without
promising
soon
to
put
a
period
to
my
miseries
i
shall
be
your
victim
in
death
after
having
devoted
my
life
to
you
in
a
way
in
which
few
women
were
ever
devoted
to
their
husbands
but
this
is
not
what
i
purposed
chiefly
to
say
this
is
what
my
situation
and
my
feelings
have
unwillingly
wrung
from
me
though
you
have
injured
me
in
the
tenderest
point
i
still
recollect
what
you
were
to
me
i
still
feel
deeply
interested
in
your
welfare
and
the
fair
fame
you
are
to
transmit
to
your
children
i
entreat
you
then
to
reflect
deeply
before
you
proceed
further
you
seem
to
me
to
stand
upon
a
precipice
nor
do
the
alteration
that
has
taken
place
in
your
manners
and
the
revolution
of
your
heart
lead
me
to
augur
favourably
of
the
plans
you
have
formed
what
is
this
stranger
whence
came
he
why
did
he
hide
himself
and
why
was
he
pursued
by
the
officers
of
justice
had
he
no
relations
was
his
bequest
of
the
sum
he
had
about
him
his
own
act
and
who
is
the
witness
to
its
deliberateness
or
its
freedom
you
must
not
think
that
the
world
is
inattentive
to
the
actions
of
men
or
their
circumstances
if
it
were
the
fame
we
prize
would
be
an
empty
bauble
no
sir
a
fair
fame
can
only
be
secured
by
unequivocal
proceedings
what
will
what
can
be
thought
of
your
giving
shelter
to
an
unknown
a
man
accused
of
crimes
a
man
never
beheld
even
by
an
individual
of
your
own
family
and
upon
the
strength
of
whose
alleged
bequest
you
are
about
to
change
the
whole
mode
of
your
life
nor
reginald
must
you
think
me
credulous
enough
to
imagine
that
you
have
now
disclosed
the
whole
or
the
precise
truth
three
thousand
crowns
is
not
a
sum
sufficient
to
account
for
what
you
propose
for
the
long
agitation
of
your
thoughts
or
for
the
change
of
character
you
have
sustained
you
must
either
be
totally
deprived
of
rational
judgment
or
there
must
be
something
behind
that
you
have
not
communicated
what
do
you
purpose
in
going
to
reside
in
the
midst
of
a
city
foreign
to
the
manners
of
a
frenchman
distracted
with
internal
broils
and
embittered
to
us
by
the
recollection
of
the
extremities
we
personally
suffered
in
it
is
your
ambition
sunk
so
low
that
it
can
be
gratified
by
such
a
transition
no
you
mean
more
than
you
have
announced
you
mean
something
you
are
unwilling
to
declare
consider
that
meaning
well
put
me
out
of
the
question
i
am
nothing
and
no
longer
desire
to
be
any
thing
but
do
not
involve
yourself
in
indelible
disgrace
or
entail
upon
your
memory
the
curses
of
your
children
what
a
distress
was
mine
who
in
return
to
so
generous
and
noble
an
expostulation
could
impart
no
confidence
and
indulge
no
sincerity
i
felt
a
misery
of
which
till
this
hour
i
had
been
unable
to
form
a
conception
fool
that
i
was
i
had
imagined
that
when
endowed
with
the
bequests
of
the
stranger
no
further
evil
could
approach
me
i
had
in
my
visionary
mood
created
castles
and
palaces
and
expatiated
in
the
most
distant
futurity
and
here
i
was
stopped
and
disappointed
at
the
threshold
in
the
very
first
step
of
my
proceedings
what
i
could
however
i
did
i
poured
forth
to
marguerite
not
the
secrets
of
my
understanding
but
the
overpowering
emotions
of
my
soul
best
most
adorable
of
women
cried
i
how
you
rend
my
heart
with
the
nobleness
of
your
remonstrances
never
was
man
blessed
with
a
partner
so
accomplished
and
exemplary
as
i
have
been
do
you
think
your
merits
can
ever
be
obliterated
from
my
memory
do
you
think
the
feelings
of
gratitude
and
admiration
can
ever
be
weakened
in
my
bosom
or
that
the
strength
and
singleness
of
my
attachment
can
suffer
decay
bear
me
witness
heaven
i
know
no
creature
on
the
face
of
the
earth
that
can
enter
into
competition
with
you
there
is
not
the
thing
in
nature
that
i
prize
in
comparison
i
love
you
a
thousand
times
better
than
myself
and
would
die
with
joy
to
purchase
your
ease
and
satisfaction
i
can
never
repay
the
benefits
you
have
conferred
on
me
i
can
never
rise
to
an
equality
with
you
what
anguish
then
do
you
inflict
upon
me
when
you
talk
of
becoming
the
victim
of
my
unkindness
believe
you
i
can
endure
after
having
dissipated
your
patrimony
and
drawn
you
with
me
into
exile
after
having
experienced
from
you
a
tenderness
such
as
man
never
in
any
other
instance
obtained
from
woman
to
entertain
the
idea
of
embittering
the
remainder
of
your
life
and
shortening
your
existence
i
should
regard
myself
as
the
most
execrable
of
monsters
i
could
not
live
under
the
recollection
of
so
a
guilt
if
you
would
not
have
me
abhor
myself
and
curse
existence
live
confide
in
me
and
be
happy
oh
marguerite
how
wretched
and
pitiable
is
my
situation
make
some
allowance
for
me
i
have
a
secret
that
i
would
give
worlds
to
utter
but
dare
not
do
not
imagine
that
there
is
or
can
be
any
decay
in
my
affection
confide
in
me
allow
to
necessity
what
never
never
could
be
the
result
of
choice
in
all
things
else
you
shall
know
my
inmost
heart
as
you
possess
the
boundless
and
unalterable
affections
of
my
marguerite
was
somewhat
but
not
wholly
soothed
by
the
earnestness
of
my
protestations
she
saw
for
the
prescience
of
the
heart
is
never
deceived
that
a
blow
was
given
to
the
entireness
of
our
affection
from
which
it
would
never
recover
she
felt
for
in
truth
and
delicacy
of
sentiment
she
was
much
my
superior
that
the
reserve
in
which
i
persisted
and
for
which
i
deprecated
excuse
might
be
sufficiently
consistent
with
a
vulgar
attachment
but
would
totally
change
the
nature
of
ours
she
was
aware
that
it
related
to
no
ordinary
point
that
it
formed
the
of
my
conduct
that
it
must
present
itself
afresh
from
day
to
day
and
that
in
its
operation
it
amounted
to
a
divorce
of
the
heart
she
submitted
however
and
endeavoured
to
appear
cheerful
though
she
felt
the
worm
of
sorrow
gnawing
her
vitals
she
was
unwilling
to
occasion
me
an
uneasiness
it
was
in
her
power
to
withhold
she
was
struck
with
the
consistency
and
determination
of
my
resistance
and
expostulated
no
more
we
went
to
constance
we
bade
adieu
to
the
scene
of
a
six
years
happiness
such
as
the
earth
has
seldom
witnessed
i
alone
had
occasioned
some
imperfection
in
that
happiness
there
were
times
indeed
when
sitting
in
affectionate
communion
with
my
wife
and
surrounded
by
my
children
my
sensations
had
been
as
delicious
as
the
state
of
human
existence
ever
had
to
boast
i
felt
my
heart
expand
i
was
conscious
to
the
unreserved
union
that
subsisted
among
us
i
felt
myself
identified
with
all
that
i
loved
and
all
for
whom
my
heart
was
anxious
but
the
curse
entailed
upon
me
from
the
earliest
period
to
which
my
memory
can
reach
operated
even
in
the
cottage
of
the
lake
i
was
not
formed
to
enjoy
a
scene
of
pastoral
simplicity
ambition
still
haunted
me
an
uneasiness
scarcely
defined
in
its
object
from
time
to
time
recurred
to
my
mind
if
i
thought
i
wanted
nothing
for
myself
i
deemed
a
career
of
honour
due
to
my
children
again
when
i
regarded
honour
as
an
empty
phantom
and
persuaded
myself
that
all
conditions
of
life
were
intrinsically
equal
i
recollected
the
fearful
scene
where
hunger
and
destruction
had
hung
over
us
in
constance
and
in
imagination
often
pictured
to
myself
that
scene
as
on
the
point
of
being
renewed
the
sword
of
the
demon
famine
seemed
to
my
disturbed
apprehension
to
be
suspended
over
us
by
a
hair
such
had
been
the
draught
of
bitterness
that
occasionally
detracted
from
this
most
enviable
as
in
retrospect
i
am
willing
to
denominate
it
period
of
my
existence
we
quitted
our
rural
retreat
and
took
up
our
abode
in
a
prosperous
mercantile
city
i
hired
commodious
apartments
in
one
of
the
grand
squares
not
far
from
the
spot
where
the
fairs
are
usually
held
undoubtedly
there
was
nothing
in
this
residence
very
congenial
to
the
bent
of
my
disposition
or
the
projects
that
fermented
in
my
mind
i
had
merely
chosen
it
by
way
of
interval
and
to
soften
the
transition
from
what
i
had
been
to
what
i
purposed
to
be
in
the
multitude
of
irresolute
thoughts
with
which
i
laboured
the
small
distance
of
constance
from
the
cottage
of
the
lake
made
me
feel
as
if
the
removal
thither
was
one
of
the
gentlest
and
most
moderate
measures
to
which
i
could
have
recourse
i
had
never
been
less
happy
and
at
peace
with
myself
than
i
was
now
from
general
society
and
the
ordinary
intercourse
of
acquaintance
i
had
long
been
estranged
and
it
was
in
vain
that
i
endeavoured
to
return
to
habits
of
that
sort
the
society
which
the
city
of
constance
afforded
had
few
charms
for
me
it
had
no
pretensions
to
the

such

the

of

the

which
were
making
upon

by
the

and
the
dogmas
of

the

before
they
had
expelled

it

had
indeed
struck

to
the

i
was
anxiously

in

hoped
that
our

might

by

to

wrong

and
entered
the

much

felt

was

an

may

regard
this

anxious
to
divert
my
thoughts
from
what
i
hoped
was
only
a
temporary
evil
i
determined
accompanied
by
charles
to
make
a
tour
of
some
of
the
cities
of
germany
dresden
was
the
capital
to
which
i
was
most
desirous
of
conducting
him
maurice
duke
of
saxony
who
held
his
court
there
and
who
was
now
only
years
of
age
was
incomparably
the
most
accomplished
prince
of
the
empire
desirous
as
i
was
that
my
only
son
should
fill
a
distinguished
career
i
thought
i
could
not
better
prepare
him
for
the
theatre
of
his
native
country
than
by
thus
initiating
him
beforehand
in
scenes
of
distinction
and
greatness
he
was
delighted
with
his
tour
we
had
not
proceeded
many
leagues
from
constance
before
indulging
in
the
bent
of
my
mind
i
laid
aside
the
humbleness
of
our
appearance
and
the
obscure
style
in
which
we
travelled
and
having
procured
a
numerous
cavalcade
of
horses
and
servants
i
set
forward
with
considerable
magnificence
we
passed
through
munich
ratisbon
and
prague
at
munich
we
found
the
court
of
the
elector
palatine
the
diet
of
the
empire
was
sitting
at
ratisbon
when
we
arrived
at
that
city
charles
had
been
almost
entirely
a
stranger
to
every
thing
princely
and
magnificent
from
the
time
he
was
nine
years
of
age
and
he
was
now
exactly
at
that
period
of
human
life
when
external
appearances
are
apt
to
make
the
strongest
impression
to
him
every
thing
that
occurred
seemed
like
transportation
into
a
new
world
the
figure
we
made
procured
us
as
strangers
unquestioned
admission
into
every
circle
we
mixed
with
princes
ourselves
in
garb
and
figure
confounded
with
those
we
saw
i
had
lived
too
much
and
too
long
in
the
most
splendid
society
to
find
difficulty
in
resuming
the
unembarrassed
and
courtly
manners
which
i
had
for
years
laid
aside
and
charles
might
be
said
to
see
his
father
in
a
new
character
novelty
prompted
his
admiration
he
was
intoxicated
with
wonder
his
disposition
had
always
led
him
to
bold
and
adventurous
conceptions
nothing
less
than
an
imperious
sense
of
duty
could
have
restrained
him
from
quitting
our
cottage
and
casting
himself
upon
the
world
in
search
of
honour
and
distinction
his
generous
heart
had
beat
to
burst
away
from
the
obscurity
of
his
station
and
it
was
with
impatience
and
discontent
that
he
looked
forward
to
the
life
of
a
swain
yet
he
knew
not
how
to
break
through
the
obstacles
that
confined
him
it
was
therefore
with
transports
of
pleasure
that
he
saw
them
vanishing
as
of
themselves
and
the
career
of
glory
opening
as
if
by
enchantment
to
his
eager
steps
the
court
of
dresden
was
infinitely
more
delightful
to
him
than
the
court
of
munich
or
the
imperial
display
at
ratisbon
here
charles
saw
a
young
prince
in
the
flower
of
his
age
whose
talents
and
spirit
rendered
him
the
universal
object
of
attention
and
adoration
he
remarked
in
the
fire
of
his
eyes
the
vivacity
of
his
gestures
and
the
grandeur
of
his
port
something
inexpressibly
different
from
those
princes
of
whom
it
is
necessary
that
their
rank
should
be
announced
to
you
by
some
extrinsic
circumstance
that
you
may
not
mistake
them
for
a
merchant
s
clerk
or
a
city
magistrate
the
sentiment
that
he
breathed
as
it
were
instinctively
as
we
returned
from
the
first
time
of
our
seeing
duke
maurice
was
at
years
of
age
may
i
in
appearance
accomplishments
and
spirit
resemble
this
man
here
i
was
desirous
of
making
a
longer
stay
than
at
the
cities
through
which
we
had
previously
passed
and
of
procuring
for
my
son
some
personal
intercourse
with
this
great
ornament
of
the
age
i
judged
this
to
be
the
more
easy
as
in
our
first
visit
to
the
palace
i
had
perceived
some
french
noblemen
of
the
protestant
persuasion
who
had
resorted
to
the
duke
s
court
in
search
of
employment
they
appeared
not
to
know
me
but
that
was
little
to
be
wondered
at
considering
that
i
had
been
seven
years
absent
from
my
country
and
that
the
calamities
by
which
i
had
been
overtaken
more
than
once
during
that
period
might
be
supposed
to
have
produced
a
greater
effect
upon
me
than
the
mere
lapse
of
years
would
have
done
among
the
rest
i
remarked
gaspar
de
coligny
who
was
only
years
of
age
at
the
time
i
quitted
france
and
had
then
been
remarked
as
one
of
the
most
promising
young
men
his
country
had
to
boast
his
stay
here
was
expected
to
be
short
his
hopes
in
his
own
country
from
the
greatness
of
his
connections
were
of
the
highest
class
and
he
had
only
come
to
dresden
at
the
earnest
invitation
of
duke
maurice
who
entertained
an
ardent
affection
for
him
my
heart
led
me
towards
him
policy
concurred
in
dictating
the
application
as
if
i
were
fortunate
enough
to
gain
his
favour
my
son
could
not
have
a
friend
better
qualified
either
to
form
his
character
or
forward
his
advancement
i
wrote
to
coligny
to
announce
my
request
to
him
and
in
a
few
hours
after
the
delivery
of
my
letter
that
young
nobleman
came
in
person
to
wait
on
me
he
informed
me
that
he
had
done
so
because
he
had
something
of
delicacy
to
mention
which
he
did
not
choose
to
trust
to
the
intermission
of
a
third
person
and
upon
which
as
he
hoped
i
could
remove
his
scruple
he
did
not
like
even
to
bestow
the
formality
of
putting
it
on
paper
i
am
a
gentleman
of
france
said
coligny
you
will
excuse
my
frankness
i
am
a
gentleman
of
france
you
will
not
wonder
at
the
niceness
of
my
honour
mixing
in
society
i
do
not
pretend
minutely
to
investigate
the
character
of
every
person
with
whom
i
converse
but
what
you
ask
of
me
obliges
me
to
consult
my
understanding
and
enquire
into
facts
i
can
not
consent
to
vouch
for
any
man
s
character
to
another
till
i
have
paid
some
attention
to
the
ground
upon
which
that
character
rests
i
remember
the
count
de
leon
with
pleasure
and
advantage
at
the
court
of
my
own
sovereign
every
one
admired
his
accomplishments
his
gallantry
and
his
learning
every
one
spoke
of
him
with
respect
unfortunate
circumstances
as
we
all
understood
deprived
you
of
your
patrimony
that
is
nothing
to
me
i
respect
a
nobleman
in
misfortune
as
much
as
when
he
is
surrounded
with
wealth
and
splendour
you
retired
into
voluntary
exile
i
heard
with
great
grief
of
some
subsequent
calamities
that
have
overtaken
you
but
here
in
saxony
i
see
you
resuming
all
your
former
splendour
and
coming
forward
with
the
magnificence
of
a
prince
other
of
your
countrymen
have
remarked
it
as
well
as
myself
and
feel
themselves
at
a
loss
to
account
for
what
they
see
excuse
me
count
by
your
application
to
me
you
oblige
me
to
speak
freely
i
dare
say
you
can
clear
up
the
difficulty
and
account
for
this
second
revolution
in
your
fortune
upon
which
i
shall
then
be
the
first
to
congratulate
you
i
can
not
suspect
a
man
with
your
high
descent
and
the
illustrious
character
you
formerly
maintained
of
any
thing
dishonourable
but
you
have
not
sufficiently
considered
the
account
we
all
owe
to
one
another
and
the
clearness
of
proceeding
we
are
obliged
to
maintain
not
only
to
our
own
hearts
but
in
the
face
of
the
world
the
present
occasion
is
i
trust
fortunate
for
you
and
when
you
have
assisted
me
in
complying
with
the
rules
by
which
every
honourable
man
governs
himself
i
shall
be
eager
to
publish
your
justification
and
render
you
all
the
service
in
my
i
was
ready
to
burst
with
astonishment
and
vexation
during
this
representation
of
coligny
i
could
feel
my
colour
change
from
pale
to
red
and
from
red
to
pale
i
could
only
answer
with
suffocation
and
inward
rage
that
i
was
much
obliged
to
him
i
would
consider
what
he
said
i
would
acquaint
him
with
my
justification
and
whenever
it
was
made
he
might
be
assured
it
should
be
an
ample
i
was
cautious
as
to
what
i
uttered
i
could
not
immediately
foresee
what
it
was
eligible
or
what
it
was
possible
to
do
and
i
was
resolved
that
i
would
not
by
an
idle
or
hasty
expression
preclude
myself
in
a
matter
of
so
much
moment
from
the
benefits
of
future
deliberation
if
what
i
had
just
heard
had
come
from
any
other
person
i
should
probably
have
despised
it
but
i
felt
at
once
that
gaspar
de
coligny
might
be
considered
in
a
case
of
this
sort
as
the
representative
of
all
that
was
most
honourable
and
illustrious
in
my
native
finding
that
i
was
indisposed
to
any
further
communication
on
the
subject
he
took
a
polite
leave
and
departed
i
was
no
sooner
alone
than
i
felt
myself
overwhelmed
with
mortification
and
shame
i
had
rejoiced
in
the
bequests
of
the
stranger
because
i
regarded
them
as
the
means
of
restoring
me
to
splendour
and
replacing
my
children
in
the
situation
to
which
they
were
entitled
by
their
birth
was
that
which
i
had
regarded
as
the
instrument
of
their
glory
to
become
the
medium
of
their
ignominy
and
disgrace
i
had
suffered
all
other
misfortunes
but
the
whisper
of
dishonour
had
never
been
breathed
against
me
i
was
a
son
of
honour
descended
of
a
race
of
heroes
and
cradled
in
the
lap
of
glory
and
fame
when
we
quitted
paris
in
the
year
my
incomparable
wife
had
set
to
sale
our
entire
property
resolved
that
though
driven
into
exile
we
would
not
leave
it
in
the
power
of
the
meanest
individual
to
controvert
the
sacred
attention
we
yielded
to
every
just
obligation
since
that
time
i
had
declined
from
the
splendour
of
rank
to
the
humble
situation
of
a
rustic
cultivating
my
little
property
with
my
own
hands
nay
i
had
even
for
a
short
time
hired
myself
as
a
labourer
in
the
garden
of
the
bishop
of
constance
but
the
same
disdain
of
every
thing
disgraceful
had
followed
me
to
my
cottage
and
my
truckle
bed
which
i
had
originally
learned
in
the
halls
of
chivalry
and
the
castle
of
my
ancestors
accordingly
i
had
uniformly
retained
the
same
honourable
character
and
spotless
fame
leon
the
virtuous
cottager
had
in
nothing
blemished
the
name
of
leon
surrounded
with
glory
in
the
siege
of
pavia
often
and
with
pride
had
i
pointed
out
this
circumstance
to
my
son
adding
wherever
fortune
calls
you
for
whatever
scenes
you
may
be
reserved
remember
that
your
father
was
unfortunate
but
that
through
life
he
never
acted
a
deed
nor
conceived
a
thought
that
should
stain
your
manly
cheeks
with
the
blush
of
shame
i
stand
before
you
a
culprit
as
having
robbed
you
of
your
patrimony
but
i
have
preserved
for
you
entire
the
inheritance
of
our
honour
this
had
been
the
first
lesson
imprinted
upon
my
infant
mind
all
other
possessions
i
had
ever
held
cheap
and
worthless
in
comparison
with
that
of
an
illustrious
name
my
indignation
at
the
attack
it
now
sustained
was
boundless
the
more
i
thought
the
more
intolerable
it
appeared
i
was
impatient
and
furious
like
a
lion
struggling
in
the
toils
i
could
with
joy
have
trampled
under
my
feet
whoever
aspersed
me
i
could
have
wantoned
in
blood
and
defied
my
adversaries
to
mortal
combat
alas
all
my
fury
was
useless
here
it
was
no
tale
whispered
in
the
dark
that
i
had
to
contend
with
it
was
the
commentary
of
the
world
upon
incontestable
facts
though
a
hecatomb
of
souls
should
be
sacrificed
at
the
shrine
of
my
blasted
name
the
facts
would
still
remain
the
mystery
still
require
to
be
solved
coligny
the
virtuous
coligny
had
made
no
observations
on
the
circumstances
he
mentioned
he
merely
proposed
a
difficulty
and
waited
my
answer
i
was
called
upon
to
exercise
the
whole
of
my
deliberative
powers
as
to
the
reply
which
was
to
be
returned
or
the
conduct
to
be
held
upon
the
question
of
coligny
every
thing
i
most
valued
was
now
at
issue
and
a
false
step
taken
under
the
present
circumstances
could
never
be
retrieved
i
had
another
sort
of
party
to
deal
with
here
than
when
i
had
told
marguerite
the
tale
of
the
stranger
and
his
legacy
nothing
would
pass
now
but
what
bore
an
open
fair
and
unequivocal
appearance
i
must
vent
no
assertion
that
could
not
bear
to
be
sifted
to
the
bottom
and
that
did
not
fully
accord
with
all
the
vouchers
with
which
it
could
be
collated
i
had
written
to
marguerite
immediately
after
launching
into
the
expense
with
which
our
tour
had
been
attended
that
i
had
received
an
unexpected
acquisition
from
the
death
of
a
relation
of
my
own
family
in
france
i
knew
that
the
story
of
the
three
thousand
crowns
would
no
longer
account
for
the
style
in
which
i
was
proceeding
and
this
fabrication
suggested
itself
upon
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
hated
to
think
of
the
difficulties
in
the
way
of
explanation
in
which
i
was
involved
i
abhorred
the
system
of
falsehood
i
was
driven
to
practise
it
did
not
occur
to
me
at
the
time
infatuated
as
i
was
that
i
should
have
occasion
to
account
for
this
accession
of
wealth
to
any
one
out
of
my
own
family
marguerite
i
well
knew
had
no
correspondence
in
france
nor
therefore
any
obvious
means
of
verifying
or
refuting
this
second
deception
but
such
a
story
could
not
be
told
to
noblemen
of
france
without
being
instantly
liable
to
be
compared
with
known
facts
and
eventually
investigated
upon
the
spot
where
the
scene
was
laid
marguerite
herself
i
well
knew
had
listened
with
incredulity
to
the
explanation
i
had
made
and
the
alleged
legacy
of
the
stranger
what
could
i
expect
from
indifferent
hearers
they
might
not
all
possess
her
good
sense
and
sagacity
in
judging
but
they
were
destitute
of
that
personal
kindness
and
partiality
which
were
calculated
to
induce
her
to
credit
whatever
i
affirmed
most
men
have
a
malignant
pleasure
in
the
detection
of
specious
pretences
in
humbling
the
importunate
superiority
that
obscures
their
claims
and
removing
the
rival
who
might
otherwise
acquire
the
prize
of
which
they
are
in
pursuit
my
mind
was
still
torn
and
distracted
with
these
contemplations
when
in
the
afternoon
of
the
same
day
on
which
i
had
received
the
visit
of
coligny
my
attention
was
suddenly
roused
by
the
abrupt
entrance
of
my
son
into
the
chamber
where
i
was
sitting
he
opened
the
door
with
a
hurried
action
as
he
entered
and
having
closed
it
impetuously
after
him
advanced
directly
towards
me
he
then
stopped
himself
and
turning
from
me
i
could
perceive
a
rush
of
crimson
in
his
face
like
that
of
a
man
suffocated
a
passion
of
tears
succeeded
that
shook
his
frame
and
sufficiently
proved
that
his
feelings
had
sustained
some
extraordinary
shock
my
whole
soul
was
alarmed
at
what
i
saw
and
following
him
as
he
retired
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
in
the
gentlest
accents
i
endeavoured
to
soothe
him
while
i
enquired
with
earnestness
and
trepidation
into
the
cause
of
his
grief
chapter
xvii
he
repelled
me
sit
down
sir
sit
down
do
not
follow
me
i
beg
of
you
but
sit
down
his
manner
was
earnest
and
emphatical
mechanically
and
without
knowing
what
i
did
i
obeyed
his
direction
he
came
towards
me
i
have
no
time
added
he
for
qualifying
and
form
tell
me
am
i
the
son
of
a
man
of
honour
or
a
villain
he
saw
i
was
shocked
at
the
unexpected
rudeness
of
his
question
forgive
me
my
father
i
have
always
been
affectionate
and
dutiful
i
have
ever
looked
up
to
you
as
my
model
and
my
oracle
but
i
have
been
insulted
it
never
was
one
of
your
lessons
to
teach
me
to
bear
an
insult
is
it
replied
i
with
the
sternness
that
the
character
of
a
father
will
seldom
fail
to
inspire
under
such
circumstances
because
you
have
been
insulted
that
you
think
yourself
authorised
to
come
home
and
insult
him
to
whom
you
owe
nothing
but
respect
and
reverence
stop
sir
before
you
claim
my
reverence
you
must
show
your
title
to
it
and
wipe
off
the
aspersions
under
which
you
at
present
insolent
presumptuous
boy
know
that
i
am
not
by
you
to
be
instructed
in
my
duty
and
will
not
answer
so
rude
a
questioner
the
down
as
yet
scarcely
shades
your
s
cheek
and
have
you
so
forgotten
the
decencies
of
life
as
to
scoff
your
father
his
eye
brightened
as
i
spoke
you
are
right
sir
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
see
your
blood
rise
in
return
to
my
passion
your
accent
is
the
accent
of
innocence
but
indeed
the
more
innocent
and
noble
you
shall
prove
yourself
the
more
readily
will
you
forgive
my
i
can
not
tell
my
temper
does
not
fit
me
to
bear
the
rudeness
of
a
son
nor
do
i
think
that
such
behaviour
as
this
can
be
any
credit
to
you
whatever
may
have
been
the
provocation
tell
me
however
what
is
the
insult
that
has
thus
deeply
shaken
you
i
went
this
afternoon
to
the
near
the
river
and
played
several
games
with
the
young
count
luitmann
while
we
were
playing
came
in
the
chevalier
dupont
my
countryman
the
insolence
of
his
nature
is
a
subject
of
general
remark
and
he
has
though
i
know
not
for
what
reason
conceived
a
particular
animosity
to
me
a
trifling
dispute
arose
between
us
we
gradually
warmed
he
threatened
to
turn
me
out
of
the
court
i
resented
the
insult
and
he
passionately
answered
that
the
son
of
an
adventurer
and
a
sharper
had
no
business
there
and
he
would
take
care
i
should
never
be
admitted
again
i
attempted
to
strike
him
but
was
prevented
and
presently
learned
that
the
sudden
and
unexplained
way
in
which
we
have
emerged
from
poverty
was
the
ground
of
his
aspersion
as
i
gained
time
and
reflected
more
distinctly
upon
what
was
alleged
i
felt
that
personal
violence
could
never
remove
an
accusation
of
this
sort
i
saw
too
though
intoxicated
as
i
had
idly
been
with
the
unwonted
splendour
to
which
i
was
introduced
i
had
not
adverted
to
it
at
the
time
that
the
case
was
of
a
nature
that
required
explanation
i
had
been
accustomed
to
reverence
and
an
implicit
faith
in
the
wisdom
and
rectitude
of
my
parents
and
therefore
encountered
in
silent
submission
the
revolution
of
our
fortune
but
this
neutrality
will
suffice
no
longer
to
you
sir
i
resort
for
explanation
send
me
back
to
the
insolent
youth
and
his
companions
with
a
plain
and
unanswerable
tale
that
may
put
to
silence
for
ever
these
brutal
scoffs
and
reproaches
let
it
be
seen
this
night
which
of
the
two
has
most
fully
merited
to
be
thrust
out
of
honourable
society
i
trust
i
have
not
so
demeaned
myself
but
that
our
mutual
companions
will
join
to
compel
this
unmannered
boor
to
retract
his
charles
you
are
too
warm
and
impetuous
too
warm
sir
when
i
hear
my
father
loaded
with
the
foulest
appellations
you
are
young
and
ill
qualified
to
terminate
in
the
proper
way
a
business
of
this
serious
aspect
leave
it
to
me
excuse
me
my
father
though
the
names
i
have
repeated
were
bestowed
upon
you
it
was
against
me
that
the
insult
was
employed
i
must
return
immediately
and
obtain
justice
this
is
a
moment
that
must
in
some
degree
fix
my
character
for
fortitude
and
determination
and
i
can
not
withdraw
from
the
duty
it
imposes
only
tell
me
what
i
have
to
say
furnish
me
with
a
direct
and
unambiguous
explanation
of
what
dupont
has
objected
to
us
and
i
undertake
for
the
i
see
my
son
that
you
are
moved
and
i
will
trust
you
he
seized
my
hand
he
gazed
earnestly
in
my
face
he
seemed
prepared
to
devour
every
word
i
should
utter
gaspar
de
coligny
the
flower
of
the
french
nobility
has
been
with
me
this
morning
he
has
stated
to
me
in
an
ingenuous
and
friendly
way
the
same
difficulty
with
which
dupont
has
so
brutally
taunted
you
i
was
meditating
and
arranging
my
answer
but
now
when
you
entered
the
as
i
uttered
these
words
charles
let
go
my
hand
and
withdrew
his
eyes
with
evident
tokens
of
disappointment
and
chagrin
he
paused
for
a
few
moments
and
then
resumed
why
do
you
tell
me
of
meditation
and
arrangement
why
did
you
send
away
coligny
unanswered
or
why
baffle
and
evade
the
earnestness
of
my
enquiries
i
know
not
all
the
sources
of
wealth
but
i
can
not
doubt
that
the
medium
through
which
wealth
has
honourably
flowed
may
without
effort
and
premeditation
easily
be
explained
a
just
and
a
brave
man
acts
fearlessly
and
with
explicitness
he
does
not
shun
but
court
the
scrutiny
of
mankind
he
lives
in
the
face
of
day
and
the
whole
world
confesses
the
clearness
of
his
spirit
and
the
rectitude
of
his
conduct
sir
i
have
just
set
my
foot
on
the
threshold
of
life
there
is
one
lesson
you
have
taught
me
which
i
swear
never
to
forget
to
hold
life
and
all
its
pleasures
cheap
in
comparison
with
an
honourable
fame
my
soul
burns
with
the
love
of
distinction
i
am
impatient
to
burst
away
from
the
goal
and
commence
the
illustrious
career
i
feel
that
i
have
a
hand
and
a
heart
capable
of
executing
the
purposes
that
my
soul
conceives
uninured
to
dishonour
or
to
any
thing
that
should
control
the
passion
of
my
bosom
think
sir
what
are
my
emotions
at
what
has
just
occurred
i
was
bred
in
obscurity
and
a
humble
station
i
owed
this
disadvantage
you
tell
me
to
your
error
i
forgave
you
i
was
content
i
felt
that
it
was
incumbent
on
me
by
my
sword
and
my
own
exertions
to
hew
my
way
to
distinction
you
have
since
exchanged
the
lowness
of
our
situation
for
riches
and
splendour
at
this
revolution
i
felt
no
displeasure
i
was
well
satisfied
to
start
upon
more
advantageous
terms
in
the
race
i
determined
to
run
but
sir
whence
came
these
riches
riches
and
poverty
are
comparatively
indifferent
to
me
but
i
was
not
born
to
be
a
mark
for
shame
to
point
her
finger
at
a
little
while
ago
you
were
poor
you
were
the
author
of
your
own
poverty
you
dissipated
your
paternal
estate
did
i
reproach
you
no
you
were
poor
but
not
dishonoured
i
attended
your
couch
in
sickness
i
exerted
my
manual
labour
to
support
you
in
affliction
i
honoured
you
for
your
affection
to
my
mother
i
listened
with
transport
to
the
history
of
your
youth
i
was
convinced
i
should
never
blush
to
call
reginald
de
leon
my
father
i
believed
that
lessons
of
honour
so
impressive
as
those
you
instilled
into
my
infant
mind
could
never
flow
but
from
an
honourable
spirit
oh
if
there
is
any
thing
equivocal
or
ignoble
in
the
riches
we
have
displayed
restore
me
instantly
restore
me
to
unblemished
and
virtuous
poverty
i
was
astonished
at
the
firmness
and
manliness
of
spirit
that
charles
upon
this
occasion
discovered
i
could
scarcely
believe
that
these
were
the
thoughts
and
words
of
a
youth
under
seventeen
years
of
age
i
felt
that
every
thing
illustrious
and
excellent
might
be
augured
of
one
who
at
these
immature
years
manifested
so
lofty
and
generous
a
soul
i
could
have
pressed
him
in
my
arms
have
indulged
my
emotions
in
sobs
and
tears
of
transport
and
congratulated
myself
that
i
was
father
to
so
worthy
a
son
but
his
temper
and
manners
awed
and
held
me
at
a
distance
this
was
one
consequence
of
the
legacies
of
the
stranger
charles
said
i
your
virtues
extort
my
confidence
for
the
world
a
tale
must
be
prepared
that
shall
serve
to
elude
its
curiosity
and
its
malice
but
to
you
i
confess
there
is
a
mystery
annexed
to
the
acquisition
of
this
wealth
that
can
never
be
he
stood
aghast
at
my
words
am
i
to
believe
my
ears
a
tale
prepared
a
mystery
never
to
be
explained
i
adjure
you
by
all
that
you
love
and
all
that
you
hold
sacred
his
voice
was
drowned
in
a
sudden
gush
of
tears
with
an
action
of
earnestness
and
deprecation
he
took
hold
of
my
hand
no
sir
no
artful
tale
no
disguise
no
hypocrisy
as
he
spoke
his
voice
suddenly
changed
his
accent
became
clear
and
will
you
consent
this
very
hour
to
quit
the
court
of
dresden
and
to
resign
fully
and
without
reserve
this
accursed
wealth
for
the
acquisition
of
which
you
refuse
to
account
whence
replied
i
have
you
the
insolence
to
make
such
a
proposal
no
i
will
not
then
i
swear
by
the
omnipresent
and
eternal
god
you
shall
never
see
or
hear
of
me
more
i
perceived
that
this
was
no
time
for
the
assertion
of
paternal
authority
i
saw
that
the
poor
boy
was
strangely
and
deeply
moved
and
i
endeavoured
to
soothe
him
i
felt
that
the
whole
course
of
his
education
had
inspired
him
with
an
uncontrollable
and
independent
spirit
and
that
it
was
too
late
to
endeavour
to
repress
it
my
dear
charles
said
i
what
is
come
to
you
when
i
listen
to
a
language
like
this
from
your
lips
i
scarcely
know
you
for
my
son
this
impertinent
dupont
has
put
you
quite
beside
yourself
another
time
we
will
talk
over
the
matter
calmly
and
depend
upon
it
every
thing
shall
be
made
out
to
your
do
not
imagine
sir
that
my
is
not
perfect
and
complete
i
know
what
i
do
and
my
resolution
is
unalterable
if
you
have
any
explanation
to
give
give
it
now
if
you
will
yield
to
my
proposal
declare
your
assent
and
i
am
again
your
son
but
to
bear
the
insults
of
my
fellows
unanswered
or
to
live
beneath
the
consciousness
of
an
artful
and
fictitious
tale
no
consideration
on
earth
shall
induce
me
i
love
you
sir
i
can
not
forget
your
lessons
or
your
virtues
i
love
my
mother
and
my
sisters
no
words
can
tell
how
dearly
and
how
much
but
my
resolution
is
taken
i
separate
myself
from
you
all
and
for
ever
nothing
in
my
mind
can
come
in
competition
with
a
life
of
unblemished
and
are
you
such
a
novice
as
to
need
the
being
told
that
honour
is
a
prize
altogether
out
of
the
reach
of
an
unknown
and
desolate
wanderer
such
as
you
propose
to
become
my
wealth
boy
is
unlimited
and
can
buy
silence
from
the
malicious
and
shouts
and
applause
from
all
the
world
a
golden
key
unlocks
the
career
of
glory
which
the
mean
and
the
pennyless
are
never
allowed
to
i
am
not
such
a
novice
as
not
to
have
heard
the
language
of
vice
though
i
never
expected
to
hear
it
from
a
father
poverty
with
integrity
shall
content
me
the
restless
eagerness
of
my
spirit
is
so
great
that
i
will
trust
to
its
suggestions
and
hope
to
surmount
the
obstacles
of
external
appearance
if
i
am
disappointed
in
this
and
destined
to
perish
unheard
of
and
unremembered
at
least
i
will
escape
reproach
i
will
neither
be
charged
with
the
deeds
nor
give
utterance
to
the
maxims
of
charles
replied
i
be
not
the
calumniator
of
your
father
i
swear
to
you
by
every
thing
that
is
sacred
and
you
know
my
integrity
never
did
the
breath
of
falsehood
pollute
these
lips
he
passionately
interrupted
me
did
the
stranger
bequeath
you
three
thousand
crowns
have
you
lately
received
an
unexpected
acquisition
by
the
death
of
a
near
relation
in
france
i
was
silent
this
was
not
a
moment
for
trifling
and
equivocation
oh
my
father
how
is
your
character
changed
and
subverted
you
say
true
for
sixteen
years
i
never
heard
a
breath
of
falsehood
from
your
lips
i
trusted
you
as
i
would
the
oracles
of
eternal
truth
but
it
is
past
a
few
short
months
have
polluted
and
defaced
a
whole
life
of
integrity
in
how
many
obscurities
and
fabulous
inconsistencies
have
you
entangled
yourself
nor
is
it
the
least
of
the
calamities
under
which
my
heart
sickens
at
this
moment
that
i
am
reduced
to
hold
language
like
this
to
a
father
what
misery
was
mine
to
hear
myself
thus
arraigned
by
my
own
son
and
to
be
unable
to
utter
one
word
in
reply
to
his
accusations
to
be
thus
triumphed
over
by
a
stripling
and
to
feel
the
most
cruel
degradation
in
the
manifestation
of
an
excellence
that
ought
to
have
swelled
my
heart
with
gratulation
and
transport
i
had
recollected
my
habitual
feelings
for
near
forty
years
of
existence
i
had
dropped
from
my
memory
my
recent
disgrace
and
dared
to
appeal
to
my
acknowledged
veracity
when
this
retort
from
my
son
came
to
plunge
me
tenfold
deeper
in
a
sea
of
shame
he
proceeded
i
am
no
longer
your
son
i
am
compelled
to
disclaim
all
affinity
with
you
but
this
is
not
all
by
your
dishonour
you
have
cut
me
off
from
the
whole
line
of
my
ancestors
i
can
not
claim
affinity
with
them
without
acknowledging
my
relation
to
you
you
have
extinguished
abruptly
an
illustrious
house
the
sun
of
leon
is
set
for
ever
standing
as
i
do
a
candidate
for
honourable
fame
i
must
henceforth
stand
by
myself
as
if
a
man
could
be
author
of
his
own
existence
and
must
expect
no
aid
no
favour
no
prepossession
from
any
earthly
consideration
save
what
i
am
and
what
i
shall
my
son
replied
i
you
cut
me
to
the
heart
such
is
the
virtue
you
display
that
i
must
confess
myself
never
to
have
been
worthy
of
you
and
i
begin
to
fear
i
am
now
less
worthy
of
you
than
ever
yet
you
must
suffer
me
to
finish
what
i
was
about
to
say
when
you
so
passionately
interrupted
me
i
swear
then
by
every
thing
that
is
sacred
that
i
am
innocent
whatever
interpretation
the
world
may
put
upon
my
sudden
wealth
there
is
no
shadow
of
dishonesty
or
guilt
connected
with
its
acquisition
the
circumstances
of
the
story
are
such
that
they
must
never
be
disclosed
i
am
bound
to
secrecy
by
the
most
inviolable
obligations
and
this
has
led
me
to
utter
a
forged
and
inconsistent
tale
but
my
conscience
has
nothing
with
which
to
reproach
me
if
then
charles
my
son
once
my
friend
my
best
and
dearest
consolation
i
pressed
his
hand
and
my
voice
faltered
as
i
spoke
if
you
are
resolute
to
separate
yourself
from
me
at
least
take
this
recollection
with
you
wherever
you
go
whatever
may
be
my
external
estimation
i
am
not
the
slave
of
vice
your
father
is
not
a
villain
alas
my
father
rejoined
charles
mournfully
what
am
i
to
believe
what
secret
can
be
involved
in
so
strange
a
reverse
of
fortune
that
is
not
dishonourable
you
have
given
utterance
to
different
fictions
on
the
subject
fictions
that
you
now
confess
to
be
such
how
am
i
to
be
convinced
that
what
you
say
at
this
moment
is
not
dictated
more
by
a
regard
for
my
tranquillity
than
by
the
simplicity
of
conscious
truth
if
i
believe
you
i
am
afraid
my
credit
will
be
the
offspring
rather
of
inclination
than
of
probability
and
indeed
if
i
believe
you
what
avails
it
the
world
will
not
believe
your
character
is
blasted
your
honour
is
destroyed
and
unless
i
separate
myself
from
you
and
disown
your
name
i
shall
be
involved
in
the
same
saying
thus
he
left
me
and
in
about
half
an
hour
returned
his
return
i
had
not
foreseen
i
had
made
no
use
of
his
absence
my
mind
was
overcome
my
understanding
was
stupified
by
a
situation
and
events
i
had
so
little
expected
i
had
stood
unmoved
leaning
against
the
wall
from
the
instant
of
his
departure
i
seemed
rooted
to
the
spot
incapable
of
calling
up
my
fortitude
or
arranging
my
ideas
my
eyes
had
rolled
my
brow
was
knit
i
had
bit
my
lips
and
my
tongue
with
agony
from
time
to
time
i
had
muttered
a
few
words
my
son
my
son
wealth
wealth
my
wife
my
son
but
they
were
incoherent
and
without
meaning
charles
the
apartment
where
the
preceding
conversation
had
passed
and
the
noise
he
made
in
entering
roused
me
he
had
his
hat
in
his
hand
which
he
threw
from
him
and
exclaimed
with
an
accent
of
dejection
and
anguish
my
father
farewell
cruel
cruel
boy
can
you
persist
in
your
harsh
and
calamitous
resolution
if
you
have
no
affection
for
me
yet
think
of
your
mother
and
your
sisters
seek
not
sir
to
turn
me
from
my
purpose
the
struggle
against
it
in
my
own
bosom
has
been
sufficiently
severe
but
it
must
be
his
voice
as
he
spoke
was
inward
stifled
and
broken
with
the
weight
of
his
feelings
then
farewell
i
replied
yet
take
with
you
some
provision
for
your
long
and
perilous
adventure
name
the
sum
you
will
accept
and
whatever
is
its
amount
it
shall
instantly
be
i
will
have
nothing
it
is
this
wealth
with
whose
splendour
i
was
at
first
child
enough
to
be
dazzled
that
has
destroyed
us
my
fingers
shall
not
be
contaminated
with
an
atom
of
it
what
is
to
be
my
fate
as
yet
i
know
not
but
i
am
young
and
strong
and
enterprising
and
courageous
the
lessons
of
honour
and
nobility
live
in
my
bosom
though
my
instructor
is
lost
his
instructions
shall
not
be
vain
once
more
farewell
from
my
heart
i
thank
you
for
your
protestations
of
innocence
never
will
i
part
with
this
last
consolation
to
believe
them
i
have
recollected
the
manner
in
which
they
were
uttered
it
was
the
manner
of
truth
if
there
be
any
evidence
of
a
contrary
tendency
that
i
will
forget
though
to
the
world
i
shall
be
without
father
and
without
relatives
i
will
still
retain
this
sacred
consolation
for
my
hours
of
retirement
and
solitude
that
my
ancestors
were
honourable
and
my
father
in
spite
of
all
presumptions
to
the
contrary
was
innocent
how
hard
it
is
to
quit
for
ever
a
family
of
love
and
affection
as
ours
has
been
bear
witness
for
me
how
deeply
i
sympathised
with
you
at
paris
in
switzerland
in
constance
though
now
you
dissolve
the
tie
between
us
yet
till
now
never
had
a
son
greater
reason
for
gratitude
to
a
father
you
and
my
mother
have
made
me
what
i
am
and
that
i
may
preserve
what
you
have
made
me
i
now
cast
myself
upon
an
untried
world
the
recollection
of
what
i
found
you
in
the
past
period
of
my
life
shall
be
for
ever
cherished
in
my
memory
i
quit
my
mother
and
my
sisters
without
or
adieu
it
will
be
a
fruitless
and
painful
addition
to
what
each
party
must
learn
to
bear
dear
excellent
peerless
protector
and
companions
of
my
early
years
my
wishes
are
yours
my
prayers
shall
for
ever
be
poured
out
for
you
you
sir
who
rob
them
of
a
son
and
a
brother
be
careful
to
make
up
to
them
a
loss
which
i
doubt
not
they
will
account
grievous
i
can
do
nothing
for
them
i
can
throw
myself
into
the
arms
of
poverty
it
is
my
duty
but
in
doing
so
i
must
separate
myself
from
them
assuredly
innocent
and
worthy
of
more
and
greater
benefits
than
i
could
ever
confer
on
them
farewell
saying
this
he
threw
himself
into
my
arms
and
i
felt
the
agonies
of
a
parting
embrace
chapter
xviii
for
some
time
i
could
not
believe
him
departed
when
i
retired
to
rest
i
felt
the
want
of
charles
to
press
my
hand
and
wish
me
refreshing
slumbers
and
i
passed
on
sad
and
solitary
to
my
chamber
when
i
came
next
morning
into
the
breakfasting
room
charles
was
not
there
to
greet
me
with
looks
of
affection
and
duty
and
the
gilding
and
ornaments
of
the
apartment
were
to
me
no
less
disconsolate
than
the
damps
and
sootiness
of
a
dungeon
i
hoped
he
would
return
i
knew
how
tenderly
he
was
attached
to
his
mother
and
his
sisters
i
was
fully
convinced
that
the
affection
for
me
which
had
been
the
perpetual
habit
of
his
mind
could
not
be
entirely
eradicated
from
his
heart
i
mentioned
him
not
in
my
letters
to
constance
the
pen
lingered
my
hand
trembled
when
i
thought
of
him
i
could
neither
pretend
that
he
was
with
me
nor
announce
the
catastrophe
of
his
absence
but
i
opened
the
letters
of
marguerite
with
still
increasing
impatience
finding
that
he
did
not
return
to
me
i
hoped
that
some
alteration
of
the
extraordinary
resolution
he
had
formed
would
lead
him
to
constance
in
vain
i
hoped
there
reached
me
by
no
conveyance
from
no
quarter
tidings
of
my
son
how
surprising
an
event
a
youth
not
seventeen
years
of
age
forming
and
executing
in
the
same
instant
the
purpose
of
flying
from
his
parents
and
his
family
deserting
all
his
hopes
all
his
attachments
all
his
fortune
refusing
the
smallest
particle
of
assistance
or
provision
in
his
entrance
upon
the
wide
scene
of
the
world
oh
charles
exclaimed
i
you
are
indeed
an
extraordinary
and
admirable
youth
but
are
you
fortified
against
all
the
temptations
of
the
world
and
all
its
hardships
do
your
tender
years
qualify
you
to
struggle
with
its
unkindness
its
indifference
and
its
insults
in
how
few
quarters
is
merit
ever
treated
with
the
attention
and
benevolence
it
deserves
how
often
is
it
reduced
to
tremble
with
indignation
at
the
scoffs
and
brutality
to
which
it
is
exposed
and
at
the
sight
of
folly
and
vice
exalted
in
its
stead
and
appointed
its
despot
and
its
master
my
son
my
son
what
will
be
your
fate
is
your
unseasoned
frame
reserved
to
perish
by
hunger
in
barren
deserts
and
beneath
inclement
skies
will
you
not
in
some
hour
of
bitter
disappointment
and
unpitied
loneliness
lay
yourself
down
in
despair
and
die
will
you
not
be
made
the
slave
of
some
capricious
tyrant
for
bread
generous
as
is
your
nature
will
it
be
eternally
proof
against
reiterated
temptation
upon
what
a
world
are
you
turned
adrift
a
world
of
which
you
know
as
little
as
the
poor
affrighted
soul
of
a
dying
man
knows
when
launching
into
the
mysterious
impenetrable
abyss
of
eternity
unnatural
father
to
have
reduced
my
only
son
to
this
cruel
alternative
i
should
with
a
less
aching
and
agonising
heart
have
accompanied
his
senseless
remains
to
the
grave
dreadful
as
that
parting
is
there
at
least
the
anxious
mind
of
the
survivor
has
rest
there
are
no
thoughts
and
devices
in
the
silence
of
the
tomb
there
all
our
prospects
end
and
we
are
no
longer
sensible
to
pain
to
persecution
to
insult
and
to
agony
but
charles
thus
departed
wandering
on
the
face
of
the
globe
without
protector
adviser
or
resource
no
lapse
of
years
can
put
a
close
upon
my
anxiety
for
him
if
i
am
in
ease
and
prosperity
i
can
not
relish
them
for
my
exposed
and
living
son
may
be
at
that
moment
in
the
depth
of
misery
if
i
am
myself
oppressed
and
suffering
the
thought
of
what
may
be
his
fate
will
form
a
dreadful
addition
to
all
my
other
calamities
what
am
i
to
say
of
him
upon
my
return
to
constance
if
he
had
died
this
was
a
natural
casualty
and
whatever
grief
it
might
occasion
time
no
doubt
would
mollify
and
abate
it
but
what
account
can
now
be
rendered
of
him
to
his
disconsolate
mother
and
terrified
sisters
how
can
i
lift
up
my
head
in
their
presence
or
meet
the
glance
of
their
reproachful
eyes
the
idea
had
occurred
to
me
in
the
instant
of
charles
s
departure
and
immediately
after
his
exit
of
detaining
or
bringing
him
back
by
force
he
was
by
his
extreme
youth
according
to
the
maxims
of
the
world
still
in
a
state
of
guardianship
and
unqualified
to
be
the
chooser
of
his
own
actions
but
to
this
mode
of
proceeding
however
deeply
i
felt
the
catastrophe
which
had
taken
place
i
could
never
consent
it
was
in
utter
hostility
to
the
lessons
of
chivalry
and
honour
with
which
i
had
been
familiarised
from
my
earliest
infancy
there
might
be
cases
in
which
this
restraint
laid
by
a
father
upon
his
child
would
be
salutary
but
the
idea
which
had
occasioned
the
secession
of
charles
was
decisive
in
this
instance
what
right
had
i
to
chain
him
to
dishonour
the
whole
bent
of
his
education
had
been
to
impress
him
with
the
feelings
by
which
he
was
now
actuated
if
i
detained
him
for
a
short
time
was
there
any
vigilance
on
earth
that
could
finally
prevent
him
from
executing
a
purpose
upon
which
his
whole
soul
was
resolved
or
suppose
there
were
must
not
the
consequence
be
to
break
his
spirit
to
deprive
him
of
all
manliness
and
energy
and
to
render
him
the
mere
drooping
and
soulless
shadow
of
that
conspicuous
hero
i
had
been
anxious
to
make
him
it
might
be
said
indeed
that
this
was
the
determination
of
a
boy
formed
in
an
hour
and
that
if
i
detained
him
only
long
enough
for
deliberation
and
revisal
he
would
of
his
own
accord
retract
so
desperate
a
project
but
i
felt
that
it
was
a
resolution
formed
to
endure
and
was
built
upon
principles
that
could
not
change
so
long
as
an
atom
of
his
mind
remained
no
i
was
rather
disposed
to
say
however
grievous
was
the
wound
he
inflicted
on
me
go
my
son
act
upon
the
dictates
of
your
choice
as
i
have
acted
on
mine
i
admire
your
resolution
though
i
can
not
imitate
it
your
purpose
is
lofty
and
godlike
and
he
that
harbours
it
was
not
born
to
be
a
slave
be
free
and
may
every
power
propitious
to
generosity
and
virtue
smooth
your
path
through
life
and
smile
upon
your
desires
the
anguish
i
felt
for
having
lost
my
son
and
in
this
painful
and
reproachful
manner
was
not
diminished
to
me
either
by
society
or
amusement
i
dared
not
go
out
of
my
house
i
saw
no
one
but
my
own
attendants
i
had
not
the
courage
to
meet
the
aspect
of
a
human
creature
i
knew
not
how
far
persons
in
dresden
might
have
heard
the
injurious
reports
which
occasioned
the
flight
of
my
son
or
even
have
been
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
that
flight
i
had
promised
to
see
coligny
again
but
alas
the
affair
which
had
at
first
led
me
to
wish
to
see
him
was
now
at
an
end
i
had
no
heart
to
seek
him
nor
indeed
did
i
know
what
story
i
was
to
tell
him
or
how
i
was
to
remove
the
suspicions
he
had
urged
against
me
the
machine
of
human
life
though
constituted
of
a
thousand
parts
is
in
all
its
parts
regularly
and
systematically
connected
nor
is
it
easy
to
insert
an
additional
member
the
spuriousness
of
which
an
accurate
observation
will
not
readily
detect
how
was
i
to
assign
a
source
of
my
wealth
different
from
the
true
which
would
not
be
liable
to
investigation
and
when
investigated
would
not
be
seen
to
be
counterfeit
this
indeed
is
the
prime
source
of
individual
security
in
human
affairs
that
whatever
any
man
does
may
be
subjected
to
examination
and
whatever
does
not
admit
of
being
satisfactorily
accounted
for
exposes
him
whom
it
concerns
to
the
most
injurious
suspicions
this
law
of
our
nature
so
salutary
in
its
general
operation
was
the
first
source
of
all
my
misfortunes
i
began
now
seriously
to
consider
what
judgment
i
was
to
pass
upon
the
bequests
of
the
stranger
were
they
to
be
regarded
as
a
benefit
or
a
misfortune
ought
they
to
be
classed
with
the
poisoned
robe
of
nessus
which
being
sent
as
a
token
of
affection
was
found
in
the
experiment
to
eat
into
the
flesh
and
burn
up
the
vitals
of
him
that
wore
it
should
i
from
this
instant
reject
their
use
and
returning
to
the
modes
of
life
established
among
my
fellow
men
content
myself
with
the
affection
of
those
with
whom
i
had
intercourse
though
poverty
and
hardships
mingled
with
the
balm
the
experiment
i
had
made
of
these
extraordinary
gifts
was
a
short
one
but
how
contrary
were
all
the
results
i
had
arrived
at
from
those
i
looked
for
when
the
stranger
had
appeared
six
months
before
at
the
cottage
of
the
lake
he
had
found
me
a
poor
man
indeed
but
rich
in
the
confidence
and
happy
in
the
security
and
content
of
every
member
of
my
family
i
lived
in
the
bosom
of
nature
surrounded
with
the
luxuriance
of
its
gifts
and
the
sublimity
of
its
features
which
the
romantic
elevation
of
my
soul
particularly
fitted
me
to
relish
in
my
domestic
scene
i
beheld
the
golden
age
renewed
the
simplicity
of
pastoral
life
without
its
grossness
a
situation
remote
from
cities
and
courts
from
traffic
and
hypocrisy
yet
not
unadorned
with
taste
imagination
and
knowledge
never
was
a
family
more
united
in
sentiments
and
affection
now
all
this
beauteous
scene
was
defaced
all
was
silence
suspicion
and
reserve
the
one
party
dared
not
be
ingenuous
and
the
other
felt
that
all
the
paradise
of
attachment
was
dwindled
to
an
empty
name
no
questions
were
asked
for
no
honest
answer
was
given
or
expected
though
corporeally
we
might
sit
in
the
same
apartment
in
mind
a
gulf
wide
impassable
and
tremendous
gaped
between
us
my
wife
pined
in
speechless
grief
and
it
was
to
be
feared
had
sustained
a
mortal
blow
my
son
my
only
son
a
youth
of
such
promise
that
i
would
not
have
exchanged
him
for
empires
had
disappeared
and
as
he
had
solemnly
protested
for
ever
my
heart
was
childless
my
bosom
was
bereaved
of
its
dearest
hope
it
was
for
him
principally
that
i
had
accepted
that
i
had
rejoiced
in
the
gifts
of
the
stranger
my
darling
vision
was
to
see
him
clothed
in
the
harness
surrounded
with
the
insignia
of
a
hero
there
was
nothing
i
so
earnestly
desired
as
that
his
merits
graced
with
the
favours
of
fortune
might
cause
him
to
stand
confessed
the
first
subject
of
france
a
situation
more
enviable
than
that
of
its
monarch
since
he
who
holds
it
is
raised
by
deeds
and
the
other
only
by
birth
and
if
less
respected
by
interested
courtiers
is
certain
to
be
more
honoured
by
the
impartial
voice
of
history
but
if
i
felt
thus
desolate
and
heartbroken
for
the
loss
of
my
son
what
would
be
the
sentiments
of
his
mother
more
susceptible
to
feel
and
in
her
present
weakness
of
spirits
less
vigorous
to
bear
than
myself
when
the
dreadful
tidings
should
be
communicated
to
her
yet
i
could
not
resolve
to
renounce
donations
which
i
had
so
dearly
appropriated
i
held
it
to
be
a
base
and
cowardly
to
surrender
gifts
so
invaluable
upon
so
insufficient
an
experiment
he
i
thought
must
be
a
man
of
ignoble
and
grovelling
spirit
who
could
easily
be
prevailed
on
to
part
with
unbounded
wealth
and
immortal
life
i
had
but
just
entered
the
vast
field
that
was
opened
to
me
it
was
of
the
nature
of
all
great
undertakings
to
be
attended
with
difficulties
and
obstacles
in
the
commencement
to
present
a
face
calculated
to
discourage
the
man
that
is
infirm
of
purpose
but
it
became
my
descent
my
character
and
pretensions
to
show
myself
serene
in
the
midst
of
storms
perseverance
and
constancy
are
the
virtues
of
a
man
affairs
of
this
extensive
compass
often
prove
in
the
issue
the
reverse
of
what
they
seemed
in
the
outset
the
tempest
might
be
expected
to
disperse
difficulties
to
unravel
themselves
and
concurrences
to
arise
all
opposition
and
hostile
appearance
give
way
before
him
who
goes
calmly
onward
and
scorns
to
be
dismayed
chapter
xix
it
was
thus
that
i
spurred
myself
to
persist
in
the
path
upon
which
i
had
entered
having
remained
some
time
at
dresden
flattering
myself
with
the
hope
that
charles
might
yet
join
me
before
i
quitted
that
city
i
began
to
think
of
once
more
turning
my
steps
towards
the
residence
of
my
family
this
was
no
cheerful
thought
but
upon
what
was
i
to
determine
i
had
a
wife
whom
i
ardently
loved
and
three
daughters
the
darlings
of
my
heart
because
i
had
lost
a
beloved
son
was
i
to
estrange
myself
from
these
i
already
felt
most
painfully
the
detachment
and
widowhood
to
which
i
was
reduced
and
i
clung
with
imperious
affection
to
what
remained
of
my
race
the
meeting
i
purposed
must
be
a
melancholy
one
but
in
the
sorrows
of
the
heart
there
is
a
purer
and
nobler
gratification
than
in
the
most
tumultuous
pleasures
where
affection
is
silent
i
looked
forward
indeed
to
scenes
of
endless
variety
and
attraction
but
in
the
mean
time
what
seemed
first
to
demand
my
attention
was
the
beloved
circle
i
had
left
behind
in
the
city
of
constance
i
retraced
upon
the
present
occasion
the
route
i
had
lately
pursued
with
my
son
how
different
were
now
my
sensations
my
heart
was
then
indeed
painfully
impressed
with
the
variance
and
dissolution
of
confidence
that
had
arisen
between
me
and
his
mother
it
was
perhaps
principally
for
the
sake
of
banishing
this
impression
that
i
had
had
recourse
to
the
splendour
of
equipage
and
attendance
which
was
first
assumed
upon
the
journey
from
constance
to
dresden
nor
frivolous
as
this
expedient
may
appear
in
the
unattractive
dispassionateness
of
narrative
had
it
been
by
any
means
weak
of
effect
at
the
time
it
was
employed
when
charles
was
once
mounted
on
his
proud
and
impatient
steed
and
decorated
in
rich
and
costly
attire
i
felt
as
it
were
the
sluggishness
of
my
imagination
roused
i
surveyed
his
shape
and
his
countenance
with
inexpressible
complacence
and
already
anticipated
the
period
when
he
was
to
become
the
favourite
of
his
sovereign
and
his
country
s
pride
now
i
returned
with
the
same
retinue
but
the
place
that
had
been
occupied
by
my
son
was
empty
i
sought
him
with
frantic
and
restless
gaze
i
figured
him
to
my
disturbed
and
furious
imagination
till
the
sensations
and
phantoms
of
my
brain
became
intolerable
i
raved
and
imprecated
curses
on
myself
i
endeavoured
to
divert
my
thoughts
by
observing
the
scenes
that
passed
before
me
they
talked
to
me
of
charles
they
had
been
pointed
out
by
each
to
each
and
had
been
the
subject
of
our
mutual
comment
though
charles
was
endowed
with
a
high
relish
for
the
beauties
of
nature
and
in
our
little
retreat
on
the
borders
of
the
lake
had
lived
in
the
midst
of
them
he
had
seen
little
of
the
variety
of
her
features
and
the
journey
we
made
through
the
heart
of
germany
had
furnished
him
with
continual
food
for
admiration
and
delight
nor
did
the
scenes
i
beheld
merely
remind
me
of
the
sensations
they
produced
in
charles
they
led
me
through
a
wider
field
i
recollected
long
conversations
and
digressive
excursions
which
had
been
started
by
the
impression
they
made
i
recollected
many
passages
and
occurrences
to
which
they
had
not
the
slightest
reference
but
which
having
arisen
while
they
constituted
the
visible
scene
were
forcibly
revived
by
its
thus
from
various
causes
my
lost
and
lamented
son
was
not
a
moment
out
of
my
thoughts
during
the
journey
while
i
continued
at
dresden
i
seemed
daily
to
expect
his
return
but
no
sooner
did
i
quit
that
city
than
despair
took
possession
of
my
heart
thus
anxious
and
distressed
i
arrived
at
prague
and
soon
after
at
ratisbon
i
travelled
slowly
because
though
i
was
desirous
of
returning
to
constance
i
anticipated
my
arrival
there
with
little
complacence
as
i
drew
nearer
to
my
family
i
felt
more
distinctly
the
impossibility
of
presenting
myself
before
them
without
first
endeavouring
to
take
off
the
shock
they
would
sustain
at
seeing
me
return
without
my
son
i
therefore
resolved
to
send
forward
a
servant
from
ratisbon
whom
i
directed
to
make
all
practicable
speed
as
i
designed
to
wait
for
an
answer
he
should
bring
me
at
the
city
of
munich
to
attempt
to
write
to
marguerite
on
this
subject
was
a
severe
trial
to
me
the
whole
however
that
i
proposed
to
myself
was
to
remove
the
surprise
which
would
be
occasioned
by
seeing
me
alone
and
to
anticipate
questions
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
hear
without
anguish
of
mind
and
perturbation
of
countenance
i
therefore
took
care
to
express
myself
in
such
terms
as
should
lead
marguerite
to
believe
that
i
had
voluntarily
left
her
son
in
saxony
and
that
in
no
very
long
time
he
would
rejoin
his
family
i
trusted
to
subsequent
events
to
unfold
the
painful
catastrophe
and
could
not
prevail
on
myself
to
shock
her
maternal
feelings
so
much
as
i
must
necessarily
do
if
i
informed
her
of
the
whole
at
once
charles
had
not
been
mentioned
but
in
ordinary
terms
and
the
accustomed
language
of
affection
in
the
letters
i
had
recently
received
from
constance
and
i
was
therefore
convinced
that
he
had
neither
gone
to
that
place
nor
had
conveyed
thither
any
account
of
his
proceedings
the
answer
i
received
from
marguerite
by
my
messenger
was
as
follows
your
absence
has
been
long
and
critical
and
the
welfare
of
your
daughters
seems
to
require
that
we
should
rejoin
each
other
as
speedily
as
may
be
whether
we
should
meet
here
or
at
any
other
place
you
must
determine
it
is
however
right
i
should
inform
you
that
during
your
absence
rumour
has
been
busy
with
your
reputation
what
the
extent
or
importance
of
the
ill
reports
circulated
of
you
may
be
i
am
scarcely
competent
to
judge
we
have
lived
in
uniform
privacy
and
it
is
natural
to
suppose
that
the
portion
of
censure
that
has
reached
us
is
but
a
small
part
of
what
really
exists
the
mode
in
which
you
have
proceeded
and
the
extraordinary
figure
you
have
made
in
a
progress
through
germany
have
given
weight
to
these
insinuations
but
it
is
not
my
intention
to
comment
on
what
you
have
done
you
appear
to
design
that
i
should
understand
you
have
left
my
son
behind
you
in
saxony
poor
charles
i
had
a
letter
from
him
three
weeks
ago
in
which
he
informs
me
of
what
has
happened
and
apologises
in
the
most
pathetic
terms
for
any
seeming
want
of
regard
to
me
in
his
conduct
at
the
very
moment
that
his
heart
bleeds
for
my
fate
i
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
communicate
this
circumstance
to
you
i
have
done
with
complaining
now
that
i
have
fallen
into
the
worst
and
most
misfortunes
i
have
a
gratification
that
i
do
not
choose
to
part
with
in
shutting
up
my
sorrows
in
my
own
breast
oh
charles
my
son
my
idol
what
is
become
of
you
for
what
calamities
are
you
reserved
he
tells
me
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
never
see
or
hear
of
him
again
never
i
his
mother
reginald
there
are
some
wounds
that
we
may
endeavour
to
forgive
but
they
leave
a
sentiment
in
the
heart
the
demonstrations
of
which
may
perhaps
be
restrained
but
which
it
is
not
in
nature
wholly
to
subdue
if
i
did
but
know
where
to
find
or
to
write
to
my
poor
boy
i
would
take
my
girls
with
me
and
partake
his
honest
and
honourable
poverty
and
never
again
join
the
shadow
of
him
who
was
my
husband
forgive
me
reginald
i
did
not
intend
to
say
this
if
i
should
prove
unable
to
control
the
impatience
of
my
grief
do
not
inflict
the
punishment
of
my
offence
on
your
innocent
daughters
as
to
your
fiction
of
voluntarily
leaving
him
behind
for
further
improvement
it
corresponds
with
every
thing
you
have
lately
attempted
to
make
me
believe
i
no
longer
expect
truth
from
you
for
seventeen
years
i
had
a
husband
well
well
i
ought
not
perhaps
to
repine
i
have
had
my
share
of
the
happiness
which
the
present
life
is
calculated
to
afford
reginald
i
have
not
long
to
live
when
i
tell
you
this
i
am
not
giving
way
to
melancholy
presentiment
i
will
exert
myself
for
the
benefit
of
my
girls
they
will
have
a
grievous
loss
in
me
and
for
their
sake
i
will
live
as
long
as
i
can
but
i
feel
that
you
have
struck
me
to
the
heart
my
nights
are
sleepless
my
flesh
is
wasted
my
appetite
is
entirely
gone
you
will
presently
be
able
to
judge
whether
i
am
deceiving
myself
the
prospect
for
these
poor
creatures
who
are
at
present
all
my
care
is
a
dismal
one
i
know
not
for
what
they
are
reserved
but
i
can
hope
for
nothing
good
when
i
am
dead
remember
and
be
a
father
to
them
i
ask
nothing
for
myself
i
have
no
longer
any
concern
with
life
but
if
my
dying
request
can
have
weight
with
you
make
up
to
them
the
duty
you
have
broken
to
me
by
all
out
past
loves
by
the
cordiality
and
confidence
in
which
we
have
so
long
lived
by
the
singleness
and
sincerity
of
our
affection
by
the
pure
delights
so
seldom
experienced
in
married
life
that
have
attended
our
union
i
conjure
you
listen
to
me
and
obey
me
in
if
i
were
deeply
distressed
for
the
loss
of
my
son
if
i
looked
forward
with
a
mingled
sensation
of
eagerness
and
alarm
to
the
approaching
interview
with
my
family
it
may
easily
be
imagined
that
this
letter
formed
a
heavy
addition
to
my
mental
anguish
i
confess
i
thought
it
a
cruel
one
marguerite
might
well
suppose
that
the
departure
of
charles
was
a
circumstance
i
must
strongly
feel
and
she
should
not
have
thus
aggravated
the
recent
wounds
of
paternal
grief
some
allowance
however
was
to
be
made
for
a
mother
when
we
are
ourselves
racked
with
intolerable
pain
that
certainly
is
not
the
time
at
which
we
can
rationally
be
expected
to
exert
the
nicest
and
most
vigilant
consideration
for
another
add
to
which
she
was
innocent
of
the
calamities
she
suffered
and
could
not
but
know
that
i
was
their
sole
author
but
whatever
may
be
decided
as
to
the
propriety
of
the
letter
its
effect
upon
my
mind
was
eminently
salutary
i
instantly
determined
on
the
conduct
it
became
me
to
pursue
i
lost
not
a
moment
from
dresden
to
munich
i
had
advanced
with
slow
and
unwilling
steps
from
munich
to
constance
i
proceeded
as
rapidly
as
the
modes
of
travelling
and
the
nature
of
the
roads
would
permit
i
left
my
retinue
at
the
gates
of
the
town
and
flew
instantly
to
the
apartments
of
my
family
i
hastened
up
stairs
and
as
i
entered
the
i
saw
the
first
and
most
exemplary
of
matrons
surrounded
by
her
blooming
daughters
i
instantly
perceived
a
great
alteration
in
her
appearance
her
look
was
dejected
her
form
emaciated
her
countenance
sickly
and
pale
she
lifted
up
her
eyes
as
i
entered
but
immediately
dropped
them
again
without
any
discernible
expression
either
of
congratulation
or
resentment
i
embraced
my
children
with
undescribable
emotion
i
said
within
myself
the
love
and
affection
i
had
reserved
for
charles
shall
be
divided
among
you
and
added
to
the
share
you
each
possess
of
my
heart
having
saluted
them
in
turn
i
addressed
myself
to
marguerite
telling
her
that
i
must
have
some
conversation
with
her
instantly
my
manner
was
earnest
she
led
the
way
into
another
apartment
i
felt
my
heart
overflowing
at
my
tongue
i
am
come
to
you
cried
i
a
repenting
prodigal
take
me
and
mould
me
at
your
pleasure
she
looked
up
she
was
struck
with
the
honest
fervour
of
my
expression
she
answered
in
almost
forgotten
terms
and
with
a
peculiar
fulness
of
meaning
my
husband
it
seemed
as
if
the
best
years
and
the
best
emotions
of
our
life
were
suddenly
renewed
most
adorable
of
women
i
continued
do
you
think
i
can
bear
that
you
should
die
and
i
your
murderer
no
man
in
any
age
or
climate
of
the
world
ever
owed
so
much
to
a
human
creature
as
i
owe
to
you
no
woman
was
ever
so
ardently
loved
no
woman
ever
so
much
deserved
to
be
loved
if
you
were
to
die
i
should
never
know
peace
again
if
you
were
to
die
the
victim
of
any
miscalculation
of
mine
i
should
be
the
blackest
of
criminals
reginald
replied
she
i
am
afraid
i
have
been
wrong
i
am
afraid
i
have
written
harshly
to
you
you
have
a
feeling
heart
and
i
have
been
too
severe
forgive
me
it
was
the
effect
of
love
affection
can
not
view
with
a
tranquil
eye
the
faults
of
the
object
let
them
be
forgotten
let
the
last
six
months
be
blotted
from
our
memory
be
as
though
they
had
never
existed
she
looked
at
me
her
look
seemed
to
say
though
she
would
not
give
the
sentiment
words
that
can
never
be
the
loss
of
charles
and
certain
other
calamities
of
that
period
are
irretrievable
i
resign
myself
into
your
hands
i
have
been
guilty
i
have
had
secrets
meditations
engendered
and
shut
up
in
my
own
bosom
but
it
shall
be
so
no
more
the
tide
of
affection
kept
back
from
its
natural
channel
now
flows
with
double
impetuousness
never
did
i
love
you
not
when
you
first
came
a
virgin
to
my
arms
not
on
the
banks
of
the
garonne
not
in
the
cottage
of
the
lake
so
fervently
so
entirely
as
i
love
you
now
be
my
director
do
with
me
as
you
please
i
have
never
been
either
wise
or
virtuous
but
when
i
have
been
implicitly
guided
by
you
i
have
wealth
i
am
forbidden
by
the
most
solemn
obligations
to
discover
the
source
of
that
wealth
this
only
i
may
not
communicate
in
all
things
else
govern
me
despotically
shall
i
resign
it
all
shall
i
return
to
the
cottage
of
the
lake
shall
i
go
a
houseless
and
helpless
wanderer
to
the
farthest
quarter
of
the
globe
speak
the
word
only
and
it
shall
be
done
i
prefer
your
affection
your
cordial
regard
in
the
most
obscure
and
meanest
retreat
to
all
that
wealth
can
purchase
or
kings
can
give
reginald
i
thank
you
i
acknowledge
in
your
present
language
and
earnestness
the
object
of
my
first
and
only
love
this
return
to
your
true
character
gives
me
all
the
pleasure
i
am
now
capable
of
receiving
but
it
is
too
late
my
son
is
lost
that
can
not
be
retrieved
your
reputation
is
blasted
i
am
sorry
you
are
returned
hither
constance
is
in
arms
against
you
and
i
will
not
answer
for
the
consequence
for
myself
i
grieve
to
tell
you
so
i
am
ashamed
of
my
weakness
but
my
heart
is
broken
i
loved
you
so
entirely
that
i
was
not
able
to
bear
any
suspension
of
our
confidence
i
had
passed
with
you
through
all
other
misfortunes
and
the
firmness
of
my
temper
was
not
shaken
for
this
one
misfortune
that
seemed
the
entire
dissolution
of
our
attachment
i
was
not
prepared
i
feel
every
morning
as
i
rise
the
warnings
of
my
decease
my
nights
are
sleepless
my
appetite
is
gone
from
oh
marguerite
talk
not
thus
distract
me
not
with
the
most
fatal
of
images
our
confidence
shall
return
all
the
causes
of
your
malady
shall
be
removed
with
the
causes
the
symptoms
depend
on
it
will
disappear
your
youth
your
tranquillity
your
happiness
shall
be
renewed
oh
no
you
shall
not
die
we
will
yet
live
to
love
and
peace
flatter
not
yourself
with
vain
hopes
my
love
i
feel
something
wrong
within
me
which
is
rapidly
wearing
my
body
to
decay
reconcile
your
mind
to
what
very
soon
must
happen
prepare
yourself
for
being
the
only
parent
to
your
remaining
offspring
i
have
composed
my
spirit
and
calmly
wait
my
fate
you
have
now
administered
to
me
the
only
consolation
i
aspired
to
by
this
return
to
your
true
character
which
affords
me
a
sanguine
hope
that
you
will
faithfully
discharge
the
duty
to
your
offspring
which
when
i
am
gone
will
be
doubly
urgent
on
i
was
grieved
to
see
that
the
mind
of
marguerite
was
so
deeply
impressed
with
the
notion
that
she
had
but
a
short
time
to
live
i
could
not
bear
to
imagine
for
a
moment
that
her
prognostic
was
just
the
thought
seemed
capable
of
driving
me
to
distraction
i
however
conceived
that
the
best
thing
that
could
be
done
for
the
present
was
to
turn
the
conversation
to
some
other
topic
well
well
my
love
i
answered
there
are
some
things
that
are
immediately
pressing
direct
me
direct
a
husband
so
amply
convinced
of
your
discretion
what
i
am
to
do
at
present
shall
i
instantly
annihilate
all
that
has
made
this
unfortunate
breach
between
us
shall
i
resign
my
wealth
from
whatever
source
derived
whither
shall
we
go
shall
we
return
to
the
cottage
of
the
lake
shall
we
retreat
into
some
distant
part
of
the
world
how
can
you
expect
me
said
marguerite
faintly
smiling
to
advise
you
respecting
the
disposal
of
a
wealth
of
the
amount
of
which
i
am
uninformed
and
the
source
of
which
is
invisible
but
i
guess
your
secret
the
stranger
who
died
your
guest
was
in
possession
of
the
philosopher
s
stone
and
he
has
bequeathed
to
you
his
discovery
i
have
heard
of
this
art
though
i
confess
i
was
not
much
inclined
to
credit
it
i
do
not
ask
you
to
confirm
my
conjecture
i
do
not
wish
that
you
should
violate
my
engagements
into
which
you
have
entered
but
upon
putting
circumstances
together
which
i
have
been
inevitably
compelled
to
do
i
apprehend
it
can
be
nothing
else
i
am
astonished
that
a
conjecture
so
obvious
should
have
offered
itself
to
my
mind
so
late
if
your
wealth
is
of
any
other
nature
ample
as
it
apparently
is
it
is
a
natural
question
to
ask
to
whom
is
it
to
be
resigned
the
ordinary
wealth
of
the
world
is
something
real
and
substantial
and
can
neither
be
created
nor
dissipated
with
a
breath
but
if
your
wealth
be
of
the
kind
i
have
named
let
me
ask
is
it
possible
to
resign
it
a
secret
is
a
thing
with
which
we
may
choose
whether
we
will
become
acquainted
but
once
known
we
can
not
become
unacquainted
with
it
at
pleasure
your
wealth
upon
my
supposition
will
always
be
at
your
beck
and
it
is
perhaps
beyond
the
strength
of
human
nature
to
refuse
under
some
circumstances
at
least
in
some
emergencies
to
use
the
wealth
which
is
within
our
reach
it
has
been
our
mutual
misfortune
that
such
an
engine
has
been
put
into
your
hands
it
has
been
your
fault
to
make
an
indiscreet
use
of
it
gladly
would
i
return
to
the
tranquil
and
unsuspected
poverty
of
the
cottage
of
the
lake
but
that
is
impossible
you
have
lost
your
son
you
have
lost
your
honest
fame
the
life
of
your
marguerite
is
undermined
and
perishing
if
it
were
possible
for
us
to
return
to
our
former
situation
and
our
former
peace
still
my
reginald
forgive
me
if
i
say
i
doubt
the
inflexibleness
of
your
resolution
the
gift
of
unbounded
wealth
if
you
possess
it
and
with
wealth
apparently
at
least
distinction
and
greatness
is
too
powerful
a
temptation
nor
though
i
should
trust
your
resistance
could
i
be
pleased
in
a
husband
with
the
possession
of
these
extraordinary
powers
it
sets
too
great
a
distance
between
the
parties
it
destroys
that
communion
of
spirit
which
is
the
soul
of
the
a
consort
should
be
a
human
being
and
an
equal
but
to
this
equality
and
simple
humanity
it
is
no
longer
in
your
power
to
return
circumstanced
then
as
we
now
are
the
marriage
union
you
must
allow
me
to
say
irreparably
dissolved
your
son
lost
your
fair
fame
destroyed
your
orphan
daughters
to
be
provided
for
i
know
not
if
i
should
advise
you
to
forget
the
prerogative
that
has
been
bought
for
you
at
so
dreadful
a
price
beside
if
i
am
not
mistaken
there
are
great
trials
in
reserve
for
you
i
am
afraid
your
present
situation
is
extremely
critical
i
am
afraid
the
suspicions
you
have
excited
will
cost
you
dear
at
all
events
i
believe
it
to
be
but
a
necessary
precaution
that
we
should
fly
from
constance
i
have
nothing
therefore
to
recommend
to
you
on
the
subject
of
wealth
but
discretion
i
shall
not
long
live
to
be
your
adviser
i
shall
always
regard
the
donation
you
have
received
you
can
not
wonder
that
i
should
so
regard
it
as
one
of
the
most
fearful
calamities
to
which
a
human
being
can
be
exposed
if
you
had
used
your
prerogative
with
discretion
you
might
perhaps
though
i
confess
i
do
not
see
how
have
escaped
the
obloquy
of
the
world
into
your
domestic
scene
where
the
interest
is
more
lively
and
the
watch
upon
you
more
unremitted
it
must
have
introduced
alienation
and
distrust
as
it
is
i
see
you
surrounded
with
dangers
of
a
thousand
denominations
police
has
its
eyes
upon
you
superstition
will
regard
you
as
the
familiar
of
demons
avarice
will
turn
upon
you
a
regard
of
jealousy
and
insatiable
appetite
if
i
could
recover
from
the
weakness
that
at
present
besets
me
and
continue
to
live
i
foresee
more
and
severer
trials
both
at
home
and
abroad
than
any
i
have
yet
sustained
and
i
am
almost
thankful
to
that
providence
which
has
decreed
to
take
me
away
from
the
evil
to
come
one
thing
further
let
me
add
i
will
speak
it
not
in
the
character
of
a
censor
but
a
friend
it
must
ever
be
right
and
useful
that
a
man
should
be
undeceived
in
any
erroneous
estimate
he
may
make
of
himself
i
have
loved
you
much
i
found
in
you
many
good
qualities
my
imagination
decorated
you
in
the
virtues
that
you
had
not
but
you
have
removed
the
veil
an
adept
and
an
alchemist
is
a
low
character
when
i
married
you
i
supposed
myself
united
to
a
nobleman
a
knight
and
a
soldier
a
man
who
would
have
revolted
with
disdain
from
every
thing
that
was
and
base
i
lived
with
you
long
and
happily
i
saw
faults
i
saw
imbecilities
i
did
not
see
them
with
indifference
but
i
endeavoured
and
with
a
degree
of
success
to
forget
and
to
forgive
them
they
did
not
contaminate
and
corrupt
the
vitals
of
honour
at
length
you
have
completely
reversed
the
scene
for
a
soldier
you
present
me
with
a
projector
and
a
chemist
a
mortal
raking
in
the
ashes
of
a
crucible
for
a
selfish
and
solitary
advantage
here
is
an
end
of
all
genuine
dignity
and
the
truest
generosity
of
soul
you
can
not
be
ingenuous
for
all
your
dealings
are
secrecy
and
darkness
you
can
not
have
a
friend
for
the
mortal
lives
not
that
can
sympathise
with
your
thoughts
and
emotions
a
generous
spirit
reginald
delights
to
live
upon
equal
terms
with
his
associates
and
fellows
he
would
disdain
when
offered
to
him
excessive
and
clandestine
advantages
equality
is
the
soul
of
real
and
cordial
society
a
man
of
rank
indeed
does
not
live
upon
equal
terms
with
the
whole
of
his
species
but
his
heart
also
can
exult
for
he
has
his
equals
how
unhappy
the
wretch
the
monster
rather
let
me
say
who
is
without
an
equal
who
looks
through
the
world
and
in
the
world
can
not
find
a
brother
who
is
endowed
with
attributes
which
no
living
being
participates
with
him
and
who
is
therefore
cut
off
for
ever
from
all
cordiality
and
confidence
can
never
unbend
himself
but
lives
the
solitary
joyless
tenant
of
a
prison
the
materials
of
which
are
emeralds
and
rubies
how
unhappy
this
wretch
how
weak
and
ignoble
the
man
that
voluntarily
accepts
these
laws
of
existence
in
the
advice
of
marguerite
i
saw
that
sound
wisdom
and
discernment
by
which
in
all
the
periods
of
our
connection
she
had
been
so
eminently
characterised
with
her
views
of
the
future
i
was
not
disposed
to
accord
i
regarded
them
as
obscured
and
discoloured
by
the
unfortunate
state
of
her
health
i
could
not
indeed
refuse
to
believe
that
the
prerogative
i
had
received
had
been
the
parent
of
much
domestic
unhappiness
willingly
would
i
have
resigned
all
that
i
had
derived
from
the
stranger
to
be
replaced
in
the
situation
in
which
his
pernicious
legacies
had
found
me
he
had
robbed
me
of
my
son
he
had
destroyed
my
domestic
peace
he
had
undermined
the
tranquillity
and
health
of
the
partner
of
my
life
these
calamities
pressed
with
a
heavy
and
intolerable
weight
at
my
heart
but
if
as
marguerite
affirmed
they
were
irretrievable
or
if
they
could
once
be
removed
and
the
domestic
advantages
i
had
heretofore
enjoyed
be
restored
i
was
not
disposed
to
fear
those
external
mischiefs
which
marguerite
so
feelingly
predicted
i
could
not
believe
that
i
should
have
such
a
league
of
foreign
enemies
to
encounter
nor
could
i
easily
image
to
myself
any
external
evils
which
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
gold
to
remedy
these
considerations
i
urged
to
my
beloved
partner
and
by
enforcing
them
endeavoured
to
remove
those
gloomy
apprehensions
from
the
prevalence
of
which
i
feared
much
injury
to
her
health
there
was
another
circumstance
i
was
led
particularly
to
insist
on
i
mean
the
nature
of
the
secret
intrusted
to
me
i
admire
your
discernment
and
ingenuity
marguerite
said
i
in
your
conjecture
respecting
the
source
of
my
wealth
i
admire
your
delicacy
in
not
pressing
me
to
decide
upon
the
truth
of
your
conjecture
this
only
i
must
be
permitted
to
say
on
that
subject
it
is
a
secret
and
you
will
perceive
that
the
same
reasons
whatever
they
are
which
make
that
secret
obligatory
on
me
require
that
it
should
be
respected
by
you
the
same
evils
that
my
own
indiscretion
may
draw
on
me
i
shall
be
equally
exposed
to
by
any
error
or
miscalculation
of
yours
i
have
therefore
most
earnestly
and
solemnly
to
conjure
you
whatever
misfortunes
may
hereafter
befall
me
in
whatever
perilous
situation
i
may
be
involved
that
you
will
never
utter
a
syllable
on
this
subject
and
that
as
i
am
the
selected
depository
of
this
secret
and
alone
know
with
certainty
what
is
its
nature
you
will
trust
our
prosperity
in
this
point
to
marguerite
engaged
to
conduct
herself
as
i
desired
the
night
which
succeeded
this
explanation
was
particularly
soothing
and
grateful
to
me
i
was
relieved
from
a
great
and
oppressive
burthen
i
was
conscious
of
that
particular
species
of
pleasure
which
arises
from
the
resolute
discharge
of
an
heroic
duty
the
peace
i
felt
within
shed
its
gay
and
reviving
beams
upon
all
around
me
reconciled
to
myself
i
was
filled
with
sanguine
and
agreeable
visions
of
the
future
my
mind
obstinately
rejected
all
dark
and
hateful
presages
i
had
intrusted
myself
and
the
direction
of
my
conduct
as
far
as
it
was
possible
to
that
better
pilot
under
whose
guidance
if
i
had
not
avoided
the
rocks
and
quicksands
of
life
i
had
at
least
escaped
with
little
comparative
injury
i
felt
therefore
as
if
my
domestic
enjoyments
were
restored
and
the
pleasures
of
my
better
years
were
about
to
run
over
again
their
auspicious
career
not
so
marguerite
she
was
mild
gentle
and
soothing
displeasure
and
resentment
towards
me
were
banished
from
her
mind
she
endeavoured
to
conquer
her
melancholy
and
to
forget
the
wounds
that
had
been
so
fatal
to
her
hopes
but
her
endeavours
were
fruitless
a
fixed
dejection
clung
to
her
heart
nor
could
the
generous
sweetness
that
pervaded
her
manners
hide
from
me
entirely
what
was
passing
in
her
bosom
during
this
interval
we
had
talked
over
the
plan
of
our
future
operations
marguerite
was
exceedingly
urgent
with
me
to
quit
constance
nor
did
i
though
not
impressed
with
her
presentiments
feel
any
reluctance
to
that
change
of
scene
which
i
believed
would
materially
contribute
to
the
serenity
of
her
mind
and
the
restoration
of
her
health
we
determined
on
some
of
the
cities
of
italy
as
the
next
place
of
our
residence
and
fixed
if
possible
to
set
out
some
time
in
the
next
day
or
the
day
after
the
plan
of
proceeding
to
france
which
had
lately
been
a
favourite
with
me
was
a
favourite
no
longer
that
had
been
the
project
of
cheerful
and
wanton
prosperity
it
had
had
for
its
object
the
of
my
family
honours
and
the
elevation
of
my
son
now
my
son
was
lost
my
wife
was
oppressed
with
languor
and
disease
my
house
was
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
this
was
no
time
for
wantonness
and
triumph
if
i
could
ever
hope
to
resume
the
plans
my
frolic
fancy
had
sketched
an
interval
at
least
of
soberer
hue
must
first
be
suffered
to
elapse
my
mind
at
this
time
sustained
a
revolution
sufficiently
remarkable
but
of
which
the
urgency
of
events
that
immediately
succeeded
prevented
me
from
ever
ascertaining
whether
it
would
have
proved
temporary
or
permanent
when
i
first
received
the
donation
of
the
stranger
my
thoughts
as
i
have
already
said
were
in
a
state
of
enthusiastic
transport
and
amidst
the
golden
visions
in
which
my
fancy
revelled
i
became
in
a
considerable
degree
alienated
from
domestic
sentiments
and
pleasures
if
i
still
loved
my
wife
and
children
it
was
the
love
of
habit
rather
than
sympathy
more
an
anxiety
for
their
prosperous
success
in
the
world
than
an
earnest
craving
for
their
presence
and
intercourse
this
state
of
intoxication
and
rapture
had
now
subsided
the
events
of
the
few
last
weeks
had
sobered
my
thoughts
having
lost
my
son
and
being
threatened
with
the
loss
of
his
mother
i
was
roused
to
a
sense
of
their
value
the
influx
of
wealth
and
supernatural
gifts
had
grown
familiar
to
my
mind
and
now
only
occupied
the
of
the
picture
i
was
once
more
a
man
and
i
hoped
to
partake
of
the
privileges
and
advantages
of
a
man
the
fate
reserved
for
these
hopes
will
speedily
be
seen
some
readers
will
perhaps
ask
me
why
anxious
as
i
was
for
the
life
of
marguerite
and
visible
as
was
the
decline
of
her
health
i
did
not
administer
to
her
of
the
elixir
of
immortality
which
was
one
of
my
peculiar
endowments
such
readers
i
have
only
to
remind
that
the
pivot
upon
which
the
history
i
am
composing
turns
is
a
mystery
if
they
will
not
accept
of
my
communication
upon
my
own
terms
they
must
lay
aside
my
book
i
am
engaged
in
relating
the
incidents
of
my
life
i
have
no
intention
to
furnish
the
remotest
hint
respecting
the
science
of
which
i
am
the
depository
that
science
affords
abundant
reasons
why
the
elixir
in
question
might
not
or
rather
could
not
be
imbibed
by
any
other
than
an
adept
chapter
xx
the
morning
after
my
return
to
my
family
as
i
sat
surrounded
with
my
girls
and
endeavouring
to
make
myself
their
playmate
and
companion
certain
officers
of
justice
belonging
to
the
supreme
tribunal
of
the
city
entered
my
apartment
they
were
sent
as
they
informed
me
to
conduct
me
to
prison
my
blood
at
this
intelligence
mounted
into
my
face
to
prison
cried
i
wherefore
what
have
i
done
i
am
no
citizen
of
your
state
what
is
the
charge
against
me
lead
me
not
to
prison
lead
me
to
your
chief
magistrate
you
will
be
called
up
for
examination
when
his
honour
is
at
leisure
to
hear
you
in
the
mean
time
you
must
go
to
do
those
who
sent
you
know
that
i
am
a
native
and
a
gentleman
of
france
they
will
be
made
to
repent
this
insolence
upon
what
pretence
do
they
dare
to
act
thus
you
will
please
not
to
talk
of
insolence
to
us
if
you
do
not
demean
yourself
quietly
silence
fellow
answered
i
fiercely
lead
the
way
by
this
time
the
children
astonished
at
a
scene
so
alarming
and
unintelligible
to
them
began
to
express
their
terror
in
various
ways
julia
who
was
ready
to
faint
occupied
the
attention
of
her
mother
the
little
marguerite
clung
round
my
knees
and
expressed
her
emotions
by
shrieks
and
cries
to
see
her
father
about
to
be
torn
from
her
by
four
strangers
the
peculiarity
of
whose
garb
of
office
aggravated
the
rudeness
of
their
countenances
and
the
peremptoriness
of
their
behaviour
was
a
spectacle
which
the
affectionateness
of
her
nature
was
unable
to
endure
i
will
go
with
you
presently
said
i
to
the
officers
see
how
you
have
terrified
the
children
nay
sir
if
you
will
behave
civilly
and
make
it
worth
our
while
we
do
not
desire
to
hurry
i
was
stung
with
the
brutal
assurance
with
which
they
thus
set
the
liberty
of
a
few
moments
at
a
price
to
me
but
i
checked
my
impatience
i
felt
that
it
would
be
both
foolish
and
degrading
to
enter
into
contention
with
such
wretches
i
turned
from
them
proudly
and
took
my
child
in
my
arms
i
will
not
be
long
gone
my
love
said
i
these
people
have
made
a
mistake
and
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
rectify
i
fancy
not
muttered
one
of
them
surlily
they
shall
not
take
you
away
papa
that
they
shall
not
i
will
hold
you
and
will
not
let
you
go
you
are
a
good
girl
marguerite
but
i
know
best
what
is
proper
and
you
must
not
think
to
control
me
the
men
will
not
do
me
any
harm
child
they
dare
not
perhaps
i
shall
be
back
to
dinner
and
mamma
will
then
tell
me
how
good
you
have
as
i
spoke
she
looked
steadfastly
in
my
face
and
then
flinging
her
arms
round
my
neck
cried
papa
and
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
i
embraced
the
other
children
and
their
mother
and
saying
to
the
latter
significantly
fear
nothing
you
know
i
have
nothing
to
fear
departed
with
my
conductors
the
way
to
the
citadel
lay
through
the
the
scene
was
already
crowded
and
i
had
the
mortification
to
be
led
along
as
a
criminal
in
the
midst
of
a
thousand
gazing
eyes
and
enquiring
tongues
new
as
every
thing
connected
with
my
present
situation
was
to
me
i
had
not
anticipated
this
vexation
i
was
stung
with
shame
and
impatience
to
my
dungeon
said
i
to
my
conductors
sternly
if
you
had
shown
yourself
better
humoured
cried
the
most
brutal
of
them
we
would
have
led
you
round
by
the
back
the
master
of
the
prison
was
somewhat
less
a
savage
than
his
officers
he
knew
my
person
and
had
heard
of
my
wealth
does
monsieur
choose
the
best
apartment
said
he
any
where
that
i
can
be
alone
answered
i
hastily
he
hesitated
a
moment
i
looked
in
his
face
oh
yes
you
will
be
paid
he
bowed
and
showed
me
to
a
room
i
shut
the
door
as
he
retired
what
had
happened
to
me
was
of
little
importance
in
itself
the
impertinence
of
bailiffs
and
is
of
no
more
real
moment
than
the
stinging
of
a
gnat
but
i
was
so
utterly
unacquainted
with
scenes
of
this
nature
the
pride
of
rank
that
swelled
within
me
made
every
appearance
of
restraint
galling
to
my
sense
from
the
instant
i
was
able
to
write
man
no
one
except
in
the
voluntary
compact
of
military
service
had
ever
said
to
me
go
there
or
do
this
and
now
was
i
to
be
directed
by
the
very
refuse
of
the
species
was
i
to
learn
the
prudence
of
not
replying
to
their
insults
was
i
to
purchase
at
a
stipulated
price
their
patience
and
forbearance
i
request
the
reader
to
pardon
me
for
troubling
him
with
my
noviciate
feelings
i
soon
learned
to
understand
the
world
the
world
of
a
prison
better
but
what
was
of
more
importance
i
was
apprehended
as
a
criminal
i
had
been
dragged
a
prisoner
of
justice
through
the
streets
of
constance
i
was
by
and
by
to
be
subjected
to
the
interrogatories
of
the
municipal
tribunal
i
could
scarcely
credit
my
senses
that
such
an
indignity
had
happened
to
the
blood
of
leon
it
is
true
i
was
innocent
i
was
conscious
whatever
might
be
my
imprudences
and
offences
towards
my
own
family
that
i
had
done
nothing
to
merit
the
animadversion
of
public
justice
but
this
was
of
no
consequence
nothing
in
my
opinion
could
wipe
away
the
disgrace
of
being
interrogated
examined
of
having
for
an
instant
imputed
to
me
the
possibility
of
being
a
criminal
i
writhed
under
this
dishonour
and
felt
it
as
a
severer
attack
than
the
question
which
was
comparatively
of
ceremony
and
etiquette
that
had
oppressed
me
in
my
residence
at
dresden
the
next
day
when
i
was
brought
up
for
examination
i
had
expected
to
be
the
complainant
in
demanding
redress
for
the
injury
i
had
sustained
but
i
was
mistaken
i
entered
the
room
haughtily
and
with
the
air
of
a
man
that
felt
himself
aggrieved
of
this
however
the
magistrate
took
no
notice
do
you
know
sir
said
i
that
i
am
a
citizen
and
a
gentleman
of
france
are
you
acquainted
with
the
treatment
i
have
experienced
have
you
lent
your
authority
to
that
treatment
wait
a
few
minutes
replied
he
with
an
imperious
tone
and
i
shall
be
at
leisure
to
attend
to
i
was
silent
after
the
interval
of
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
resumed
you
call
yourself
the
count
de
leon
i
perhaps
sir
you
are
uninformed
of
the
purity
with
which
justice
is
administered
in
the
city
within
whose
jurisdiction
you
now
stand
our
state
is
a
small
one
and
its
magistrates
are
therefore
enabled
to
discharge
the
office
of
a
parent
not
only
to
its
proper
citizens
but
to
all
strangers
that
place
themselves
under
its
i
remember
sir
that
seven
years
ago
i
and
my
wife
and
four
children
sick
and
unfriended
were
upon
the
point
of
perishing
with
hunger
within
the
walls
of
this
city
the
fact
i
mentioned
was
wholly
foreign
to
the
point
with
which
i
was
at
present
concerned
but
the
parading
arrogance
of
the
man
brought
it
forcibly
to
my
memory
and
wrung
it
from
my
lips
le
replied
he
you
are
petulant
it
is
not
the
office
of
a
state
to
feed
the
souls
it
contains
it
could
not
do
that
without
making
them
slaves
its
proper
concern
is
to
maintain
them
in
that
security
and
freedom
of
action
which
may
best
enable
them
to
support
i
suppressed
the
emotions
which
the
tone
of
this
speech
excited
i
was
unwilling
to
enter
into
contention
with
a
man
whom
i
regarded
as
inexpressibly
my
inferior
is
it
cried
i
sternly
a
part
of
the
justice
you
boast
of
to
drag
a
man
of
rank
and
a
stranger
from
his
home
without
any
intimation
of
the
cause
of
his
being
so
treated
and
then
instead
of
investigating
immediately
the
charge
against
him
to
send
him
to
prison
unheard
i
disdain
to
mention
the
behaviour
of
your
officers
those
things
naturally
grow
out
of
the
abuses
practised
by
their
the
mode
of
our
proceeding
replied
he
depends
upon
the
seriousness
of
the
crime
imputed
if
a
man
of
distinction
labours
under
a
slight
accusation
only
we
then
treat
him
with
all
proper
forbearance
and
respect
but
when
he
is
suspected
of
a
crime
of
more
than
ordinary
magnitude
that
alters
the
case
the
man
who
has
ceased
to
respect
himself
must
look
for
no
respect
from
i
was
for
a
moment
thunderstruck
and
speechless
at
length
fiercely
i
cried
produce
my
accusers
that
is
not
the
mode
of
proceeding
in
constance
i
have
certain
questions
to
propound
to
you
when
you
have
answered
them
we
shall
see
what
is
to
be
done
carry
me
before
the
of
your
city
if
i
am
to
be
examined
further
let
it
be
by
your
sovereign
the
moved
by
the
state
of
our
affairs
in
matters
of
religion
has
been
prevailed
on
to
delegate
his
juridical
authority
i
am
the
person
to
whom
the
cognisance
of
your
business
belongs
and
at
certain
times
aided
by
my
assessors
have
the
power
of
life
and
death
within
this
city
you
have
had
every
indulgence
to
which
you
are
entitled
and
it
will
be
your
wisdom
to
be
no
further
propose
your
questions
a
person
apparently
greatly
advanced
in
years
arrived
in
the
autumn
of
last
year
at
a
miserable
farm
you
at
that
time
cultivated
called
the
cottage
of
the
lake
it
is
to
him
that
my
questions
will
principally
i
stood
aghast
the
words
of
the
magistrate
were
most
unwelcome
sounds
i
remembered
that
the
stranger
had
said
to
me
when
i
am
once
buried
speak
of
me
and
if
possible
think
of
me
no
i
replied
with
eagerness
and
alarm
of
that
person
i
have
nothing
to
say
spare
your
questions
i
have
no
answer
to
return
you
what
was
his
name
i
know
his
country
i
can
not
inform
it
is
understood
that
he
died
or
in
some
manner
disappeared
while
under
your
protection
yet
in
the
registers
of
the
church
there
is
no
notice
of
that
event
if
he
died
no
application
was
made
for
the
rites
of
religion
to
him
dying
or
to
his
body
when
his
spirit
had
deserted
it
you
are
required
to
answer
what
became
of
him
or
his
remains
i
have
already
told
you
that
from
me
you
will
obtain
no
one
question
more
sir
seven
years
ago
you
tell
me
you
and
your
family
were
perishing
with
hunger
soon
after
you
removed
from
obscure
lodgings
in
this
city
to
the
cottage
of
the
lake
and
seemed
to
be
laudably
employed
in
earning
for
yourself
a
scanty
livelihood
with
the
labour
of
your
hands
but
within
the
last
six
months
the
scene
is
wholly
changed
you
appear
to
have
suddenly
grown
rich
and
here
and
in
other
parts
of
germany
have
actually
disbursed
considerable
sums
whence
comes
this
change
the
train
of
questions
thus
proposed
to
me
impelled
me
to
a
serious
reply
le
said
i
i
am
a
stranger
a
native
of
france
and
a
man
of
rank
in
my
own
country
i
have
paid
your
state
the
compliment
of
choosing
it
for
my
residence
i
have
expended
my
industry
i
expend
my
wealth
among
you
i
have
comported
myself
as
a
peaceable
inhabitant
no
action
of
my
life
has
brought
scandal
upon
your
state
or
disturbed
the
peace
and
tranquillity
of
your
affairs
i
can
not
collect
from
any
thing
you
have
said
that
i
have
any
accuser
or
that
any
charge
has
been
alleged
against
me
till
that
happens
i
can
not
fall
under
your
animadversion
i
am
a
man
of
generous
birth
and
honourable
sentiments
to
myself
and
my
own
conscience
only
am
i
accountable
for
my
expenditure
and
my
income
i
disdain
to
answer
to
any
tribunal
on
earth
an
enquiry
of
this
sort
and
now
sir
in
conclusion
what
i
demand
of
you
is
first
my
liberty
and
secondly
an
ample
reparation
for
the
interruption
i
have
sustained
and
the
insults
to
which
i
have
causelessly
been
you
are
mistaken
sir
said
the
magistrate
what
you
mention
may
be
the
rule
of
administering
justice
in
some
states
they
may
decide
if
they
think
proper
that
some
open
act
apparently
of
a
criminal
description
must
be
alleged
against
a
man
before
he
can
become
an
object
of
animadversion
to
the
state
but
in
constance
as
i
have
already
told
you
the
government
assumes
to
act
the
part
of
a
parent
to
its
subjects
i
sit
here
not
merely
to
investigate
and
examine
definite
acts
but
as
a
censor
morum
and
i
should
violate
the
oath
of
my
office
if
i
did
not
lend
a
vigilant
attention
to
the
behaviour
and
conduct
of
every
one
within
my
jurisdiction
the
city
of
constance
requires
that
nothing
immoral
licentious
or
of
suspicious
character
shall
be
transacted
within
its
walls
your
proceedings
have
escaped
notice
too
long
much
longer
than
they
would
have
done
but
for
your
late
absence
in
cases
where
what
is
committed
is
merely
immoral
or
licentious
we
content
ourselves
with
sending
the
offender
out
of
our
walls
but
your
case
is
of
a
complicated
nature
it
has
scandalised
all
the
inhabitants
of
our
virtuous
and
religious
city
unless
you
answer
my
enquiries
and
give
a
clear
and
satisfactory
account
of
your
wealth
i
am
bound
to
believe
that
there
is
something
in
the
business
that
will
not
bear
the
light
the
coincidence
of
times
obliges
me
to
connect
the
disappearance
of
your
guest
and
the
sudden
growth
of
your
fortune
this
connection
gives
rise
to
the
most
alarming
suspicions
i
have
therefore
to
inform
you
that
unless
you
honourably
clear
up
these
suspicions
by
the
most
ample
communication
my
duty
directs
me
to
remand
you
to
prison
and
to
assure
you
that
you
will
not
be
liberated
thence
till
you
have
satisfied
the
whole
of
my
think
deliberately
answered
i
of
your
decision
before
you
form
it
your
prisons
i
despise
but
i
will
not
suffer
my
reputation
and
my
honour
to
be
trifled
with
i
came
before
you
willingly
though
i
could
easily
have
avoided
doing
so
because
i
was
eager
to
clear
my
fame
i
expected
accusers
and
i
knew
i
could
confound
accusation
but
what
is
this
that
you
call
justice
you
put
together
circumstances
in
your
own
mind
you
form
conjectures
and
then
without
information
accuser
or
oath
without
the
semblance
of
guilt
you
condemn
me
to
prison
and
expect
to
extort
from
me
confession
in
defect
of
articles
of
charge
i
disdain
to
answer
the
only
return
a
man
of
honour
should
make
to
loose
conjectures
and
random
calumnies
is
silence
i
am
descended
from
a
race
of
heroes
knights
of
the
cross
and
champions
of
france
and
their
blood
has
not
degenerated
in
my
veins
i
feel
myself
animated
by
the
soul
of
honour
and
incapable
of
crime
i
know
my
innocence
and
i
rest
upon
it
with
confidence
your
vulgar
citizens
habituated
to
none
but
the
groveling
notions
of
traffic
and
barter
are
not
the
peers
of
leon
nor
able
to
comprehend
the
views
and
sentiments
by
which
he
is
you
are
mighty
monsieur
leon
replied
the
magistrate
and
your
words
are
big
and
sounding
but
we
know
that
the
devil
can
assume
the
form
of
an
angel
and
that
the
most
infamous
and
profligate
character
can
pronounce
with
emphasis
sentiments
of
the
purest
virtue
you
are
pleased
to
decide
that
the
presumptions
against
you
are
nothing
but
calumnies
is
it
nothing
that
having
received
a
stranger
and
retained
him
with
you
for
months
you
endeavoured
to
conceal
this
fact
and
never
suffered
him
to
be
seen
by
a
human
creature
is
his
final
disappearance
nothing
is
it
nothing
that
supposing
him
to
be
dead
as
he
probably
is
you
denied
to
his
remains
the
rites
of
funeral
and
refuse
to
tell
what
is
become
of
the
body
is
it
nothing
that
upon
the
death
of
this
stranger
you
who
were
before
in
a
state
almost
of
penury
suddenly
appear
to
be
possessed
of
unbounded
riches
where
is
the
will
of
this
stranger
in
what
archives
have
you
deposited
the
declaration
of
his
wealth
let
me
tell
you
sir
that
these
presumptions
which
you
call
nothing
form
a
body
of
circumstantial
evidence
that
in
many
countries
would
have
led
you
to
the
scaffold
as
a
murderer
but
the
laws
of
constance
which
you
audaciously
revile
are
the
mildest
in
the
universe
here
we
never
put
a
man
to
death
but
on
his
own
confession
we
simply
condemn
him
to
perpetual
imprisonment
or
until
he
makes
a
declaration
of
his
guilt
you
refuse
to
declare
the
name
or
country
of
the
man
whom
you
are
suspected
of
murdering
and
then
have
the
assurance
to
boast
that
no
private
accuser
rises
against
you
no
sir
we
know
there
can
be
no
private
accuser
where
the
connections
of
the
party
can
be
successfully
concealed
but
shall
this
concealment
which
is
an
aggravation
of
the
murder
prove
its
security
in
conclusion
you
boast
of
your
blood
and
heroic
sentiments
and
rail
at
our
citizens
as
shopkeepers
and
merchants
let
me
tell
you
sir
shopkeepers
and
merchants
though
we
are
we
should
scorn
to
conduct
ourselves
in
the
obscure
and
suspicious
manner
that
you
have
done
and
now
i
have
taken
the
trouble
to
refute
your
flimsy
pretences
which
it
was
wholly
unnecessary
for
me
to
do
i
have
done
with
you
you
know
your
destination
unless
you
are
prepared
immediately
to
give
a
satisfactory
account
of
yourself
and
your
finding
it
impossible
to
make
on
this
man
the
impression
i
desired
i
declined
entering
into
further
parley
and
telling
him
that
i
should
convey
a
representation
of
my
case
to
my
native
sovereign
and
did
not
doubt
soon
to
make
him
feel
the
rashness
of
his
proceeding
i
withdrew
in
the
custody
of
the
officers
who
had
conducted
me
to
the
scene
of
audience
i
was
i
confess
struck
with
the
coincidence
of
circumstances
which
the
magistrate
had
placed
in
a
fight
equally
unexpected
and
forcible
and
which
i
now
saw
calculated
to
subject
me
to
the
most
injurious
suspicions
i
was
not
disposed
in
the
smallest
degree
to
yield
to
the
attack
but
i
felt
a
desire
to
act
deliberately
and
with
caution
the
whole
of
what
i
had
heard
was
utterly
unforeseen
and
it
was
with
peculiar
anguish
that
i
became
aware
of
this
new
consequence
of
the
stranger
s
pernicious
donation
this
was
a
consequence
that
no
resignation
no
abjuration
of
his
bequests
could
cure
and
that
must
be
stood
up
to
with
manly
courage
if
any
hope
were
entertained
of
averting
it
chapter
xxi
the
appearance
of
wealth
that
accompanied
me
had
by
this
time
made
its
impression
upon
my
keepers
and
one
of
them
now
informed
me
that
monsieur
monluc
an
agent
of
the
court
of
france
who
was
making
a
tour
of
several
of
the
german
states
by
order
of
his
sovereign
had
arrived
the
night
before
at
the
city
of
constance
there
was
no
representative
of
my
country
regularly
resident
here
and
i
immediately
felt
the
presence
of
monluc
to
be
the
most
fortunate
event
that
could
have
occurred
for
effecting
my
honourable
deliverance
selfishness
and
avarice
it
may
be
thought
would
rather
have
impelled
the
persons
who
had
me
in
custody
to
conceal
from
me
a
circumstance
calculated
to
deprive
them
of
an
advantageous
prey
but
in
those
groveling
souls
from
whom
riches
never
fail
to
extort
homage
however
strange
it
may
seem
the
homage
often
appears
disinterested
they
pay
it
by
a
sort
of
irresistible
instinct
and
admiring
what
they
covet
at
an
awful
distance
with
difficulty
assume
the
courage
to
pollute
their
worship
with
ideas
of
calculation
and
gain
i
immediately
addressed
a
memorial
to
this
gallant
soldier
with
whose
person
indeed
i
was
unacquainted
but
the
fame
of
whose
spirit
and
enterprise
had
not
failed
to
have
reached
me
i
represented
to
him
that
i
was
a
frenchman
of
family
and
distinction
that
i
had
been
seized
upon
and
was
retained
in
prison
by
the
magistrates
here
without
accuser
or
the
hope
of
a
trial
that
i
had
not
been
guilty
of
the
shadow
of
a
crime
and
that
i
knew
the
benignity
and
courage
of
my
sovereign
would
never
permit
a
subject
of
france
to
languish
under
calumny
and
oppression
in
a
foreign
country
i
added
that
he
would
do
an
acceptable
service
to
king
francis
to
whom
i
had
the
honour
to
be
known
by
interfering
in
my
favour
and
therefore
entreated
him
to
obtain
for
me
immediate
justice
and
deliverance
monluc
returned
me
an
answer
by
the
bearer
of
my
memorial
assuring
me
that
he
would
lose
no
time
in
enquiring
into
the
merits
of
my
case
and
that
i
might
depend
upon
receiving
every
assistance
from
him
that
a
man
of
honour
could
desire
the
warmth
and
frankness
of
this
answer
filled
me
with
hope
for
there
was
no
deliverance
from
my
present
situation
that
i
could
contemplate
with
satisfaction
but
such
a
one
as
should
be
accompanied
with
reparation
and
three
days
however
elapsed
before
i
heard
again
from
the
french
envoy
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
he
announced
his
intention
of
visiting
me
and
about
an
hour
after
arrived
at
the
prison
his
appearance
was
striking
he
was
tall
slender
and
well
made
with
a
freedom
of
carriage
not
derived
from
the
polish
of
courts
but
which
appeared
to
flow
from
the
manliness
and
active
energies
of
his
mind
his
hair
and
complexion
were
dark
the
former
though
he
was
still
young
rather
scantily
shaded
a
high
and
ample
forehead
his
features
were
expressive
of
the
sanguine
and
adust
temper
of
his
mind
and
though
his
eye
was
animated
his
countenance
as
he
entered
struck
me
as
particularly
solemn
you
are
the
count
de
leon
said
he
i
you
sent
me
a
memorial
a
few
days
ago
complaining
of
the
tribunal
of
this
city
i
am
afraid
sir
i
can
do
nothing
for
my
countenance
fell
as
he
spoke
i
gasped
for
breath
i
had
conceived
a
most
favourable
anticipation
as
he
entered
and
my
disappointment
was
particularly
cruel
i
had
said
in
my
heart
this
is
the
very
man
to
rescue
my
injured
fame
i
see
sir
you
are
disappointed
resumed
he
i
have
not
given
up
the
affair
if
i
had
this
visit
which
i
design
as
a
mark
of
attention
would
be
an
insult
the
moment
i
received
your
memorial
i
paid
the
utmost
regard
to
it
if
the
affair
had
been
as
you
represented
it
i
know
i
could
not
do
any
thing
more
acceptable
to
my
sovereign
than
interfere
in
your
behalf
i
have
spent
the
whole
interval
in
investigating
the
case
i
have
seen
the
magistrate
who
committed
you
i
have
visited
the
spot
where
your
crime
is
alleged
to
have
been
perpetrated
i
have
had
an
interview
with
your
well
sir
cried
i
alarmed
and
impatient
well
sir
and
the
result
appearances
are
uncommonly
strong
against
you
they
can
scarcely
he
stronger
but
you
have
a
right
to
be
heard
it
is
for
the
sake
of
discharging
that
last
act
of
justice
that
you
see
me
this
great
god
exclaimed
i
overwhelmed
with
chagrin
is
if
possible
that
my
countryman
the
man
to
whom
i
was
proud
and
happy
to
appeal
the
gallant
monluc
should
believe
me
a
murderer
i
swear
by
every
thing
that
is
sacred
by
the
blood
of
him
that
died
for
me
on
the
cross
and
by
my
eternal
salvation
that
i
am
as
innocent
as
the
child
unborn
i
am
glad
to
hear
you
express
yourself
with
this
emphasis
and
fervour
i
can
not
but
say
that
to
my
own
feelings
it
has
great
weight
but
i
must
not
suffer
myself
as
a
man
and
still
less
in
the
public
capacity
in
which
i
stand
to
be
overcome
and
confounded
by
your
asseverations
there
is
a
connected
and
most
unfavourable
story
against
you
this
it
is
incumbent
on
you
to
clear
and
you
say
you
have
seen
my
wife
i
was
distracted
and
overwhelmed
by
monluc
s
way
of
putting
the
question
i
was
divided
between
my
anxiety
to
be
justified
and
the
solemn
mystery
of
the
affair
to
which
his
enquiries
led
and
i
probably
spoke
thus
from
an
unconscious
desire
to
gain
time
yes
that
is
another
presumption
in
your
favour
madame
de
leon
is
perhaps
the
most
striking
and
extraordinary
woman
i
ever
saw
of
the
husband
of
such
a
woman
especially
when
he
appears
to
be
the
object
of
her
attachment
i
should
be
always
inclined
to
think
well
madame
de
leon
pleaded
for
you
with
earnestness
and
affection
but
amidst
all
her
ardour
i
could
perceive
that
she
felt
there
was
something
mysterious
and
unpleasant
in
the
affair
that
she
was
unable
to
as
monluc
spoke
i
saw
that
i
had
failed
in
one
of
the
main
anchors
of
my
hope
i
thought
that
no
one
could
have
talked
with
my
beloved
marguerite
and
have
left
her
with
the
opinion
that
i
was
a
murderer
how
did
this
happen
was
she
lukewarm
and
unfaithful
in
my
vindication
what
she
continued
my
countryman
i
could
see
was
not
only
unable
to
explain
but
did
not
fully
understand
it
is
you
alone
can
clear
the
concealment
of
the
stranger
his
disappearance
what
became
of
the
body
and
your
own
sudden
transition
from
poverty
to
i
was
by
this
time
fully
sensible
of
the
nature
of
my
situation
i
summoned
my
fortitude
i
felt
that
i
had
no
longer
any
hope
but
in
the
dignity
of
innocence
you
call
on
me
for
explanation
replied
i
can
you
not
conceive
gallant
monluc
that
i
may
be
able
to
resolve
your
doubts
and
yet
that
i
will
not
explanation
is
not
the
business
of
a
man
of
honour
he
can
not
stoop
to
it
he
will
win
the
applause
and
approbation
of
mankind
if
won
in
silence
he
will
hold
on
the
even
course
of
a
generous
spirit
and
turn
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
to
court
the
suffrage
or
deprecate
the
condemnation
of
a
giddy
multitude
such
my
brave
countryman
have
been
the
maxims
of
my
past
life
such
will
be
the
maxims
of
my
i
admire
answered
monluc
at
least
the
gallantry
of
these
sentiments
though
i
may
be
inclined
to
doubt
their
prudence
but
if
such
is
your
determination
permit
me
to
say
you
have
no
concern
with
me
he
who
resolutely
withholds
explanation
must
arm
himself
with
patience
and
either
wait
the
operation
of
time
or
rest
satisfied
with
the
consciousness
of
his
and
is
that
all
will
there
not
be
some
noble
spirits
who
separating
themselves
from
the
herd
will
judge
of
him
by
what
they
feel
in
their
own
breasts
and
be
drawn
to
him
with
an
irresistible
impulse
was
it
not
natural
that
i
should
expect
monluc
to
be
one
of
these
it
would
be
hard
indeed
if
he
who
disdains
to
temporise
with
popularity
and
to
vindicate
himself
from
the
ungenerous
constructions
of
sordid
minds
should
not
by
that
very
proceeding
secure
the
friendship
and
sympathy
of
those
whose
friendship
it
will
be
most
grateful
to
him
to
the
friends
of
an
innocent
man
whom
a
combination
of
circumstances
has
exposed
to
the
most
painful
suspicions
must
always
be
few
he
can
scarcely
expect
the
acquittal
and
sympathy
of
a
stranger
i
must
know
i
must
have
felt
and
observed
in
a
man
a
thousand
virtues
before
i
can
be
entitled
to
treat
accumulated
presumptions
against
him
as
and
thus
then
are
to
end
my
hopes
in
monluc
he
does
not
feel
that
i
am
innocent
he
does
not
recognise
in
me
the
countenance
the
voice
the
turn
of
thought
of
a
brother
a
man
no
less
incapable
than
himself
of
every
thing
disgraceful
and
ignominious
be
it
so
i
will
as
you
advise
me
rest
upon
the
consciousness
of
my
innocence
a
frenchman
the
descendant
of
illustrious
ancestors
long
an
exile
long
the
victim
of
adversity
but
at
all
times
conscious
of
the
purity
of
my
sentiments
and
the
integrity
of
my
conduct
i
will
not
suffer
myself
to
be
overwhelmed
with
this
last
desertion
this
ultimate
refusal
of
justice
count
de
leon
your
appeal
is
full
of
energy
in
whatever
way
i
decide
it
will
leave
an
unpleasant
sensation
in
my
breast
let
us
suppose
that
as
a
private
man
i
could
take
you
to
my
arms
and
dismiss
every
unfavourable
appearance
from
my
mind
you
must
remember
that
i
am
here
in
a
public
character
and
that
only
in
a
public
character
am
i
capable
of
affording
you
assistance
thus
situated
i
am
bound
to
resist
the
impulses
of
a
romantic
and
irregular
confidence
and
to
do
nothing
of
which
i
shall
not
be
able
to
render
a
clear
and
intelligible
account
let
us
not
part
thus
it
is
not
the
vindication
of
your
character
to
the
world
with
which
we
are
at
present
concerned
it
is
only
necessary
that
you
should
furnish
a
sufficient
ground
to
justify
me
to
myself
for
interfering
in
your
behalf
explain
to
me
the
particulars
of
your
case
in
confidence
if
you
will
but
fully
and
without
reserve
i
will
not
abuse
your
confidence
i
will
make
no
use
of
your
communication
but
such
as
you
shall
yourself
approve
only
enable
me
to
have
a
reason
for
acting
that
is
not
merely
capable
of
being
felt
but
that
i
may
know
is
in
its
own
nature
capable
of
being
stated
to
another
it
is
upon
me
that
you
call
to
take
certain
measures
you
must
enable
me
to
judge
of
their
propriety
you
are
mistaken
when
you
suppose
the
appearances
against
you
to
be
slight
it
is
not
a
slight
circumstance
that
you
profess
to
be
ignorant
of
or
have
refused
to
disclose
the
country
the
connections
and
even
the
name
of
the
stranger
whom
you
so
anxiously
concealed
the
disappearance
of
his
body
is
still
more
extraordinary
what
intelligible
motive
except
a
guilty
one
can
i
assign
for
that
but
your
sudden
wealth
immediately
after
this
disappearance
is
especially
material
it
is
a
broad
and
glaring
fact
that
men
can
not
shut
their
eyes
on
if
they
would
the
chain
and
combination
of
events
that
proceeds
systematically
from
link
to
link
is
the
criterion
of
guilt
and
the
protector
of
reputation
your
case
as
it
now
stands
is
scarcely
to
be
termed
equivocal
upon
the
supposition
of
your
criminality
all
is
plain
and
easy
to
be
accounted
for
upon
any
other
supposition
it
appears
an
inscrutable
mystery
place
but
the
balance
even
present
to
me
an
exposition
of
these
facts
that
shall
make
your
innocence
not
less
probable
than
your
guilt
and
as
i
feel
myself
interested
for
you
and
your
family
and
as
the
presumption
when
matters
are
doubtful
ought
always
to
be
on
the
favourable
side
i
consent
to
be
your
friend
how
unfortunate
i
exclaimed
am
i
doomed
to
be
your
proposal
is
liberal
and
generous
but
i
must
refuse
it
my
story
is
an
unhappy
one
particulars
have
been
reposed
in
my
fidelity
which
i
am
not
at
liberty
to
communicate
but
which
if
communicated
you
would
not
regard
as
dishonourable
i
may
be
made
the
martyr
of
infamy
and
the
abhorrence
of
my
species
i
can
endure
adversity
and
anguish
i
can
die
but
that
which
you
demand
from
me
never
can
be
confided
to
any
mortal
ear
as
you
please
rejoined
monluc
the
secrets
of
a
dead
man
to
be
preserved
after
his
death
and
that
to
the
ruin
of
him
who
is
their
depository
must
i
believe
be
villanous
secrets
and
the
secret
of
a
villain
no
one
is
bound
to
observe
you
must
further
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
that
whatever
a
sense
of
honour
might
dictate
in
that
point
the
fortune
you
possess
is
your
own
affair
and
to
dissipate
or
not
the
mystery
which
hangs
upon
that
is
wholly
at
your
discretion
but
i
have
already
advanced
as
far
perhaps
further
than
circumstances
or
propriety
could
justify
and
there
can
now
be
no
more
parley
between
monluc
cried
i
i
submit
however
harsh
your
decision
is
as
towards
me
however
painful
and
unfortunate
its
consequences
i
will
admit
it
to
be
that
which
duty
prescribes
to
you
i
struggle
i
contend
no
further
one
thing
only
i
would
willingly
obtain
of
you
that
you
would
interpose
your
influence
to
obtain
for
me
the
society
and
intercourse
of
my
family
the
transaction
of
this
day
will
then
be
remembered
by
me
with
respect
towards
you
and
a
melancholy
regret
that
i
could
not
entitle
myself
to
your
esteem
i
shall
recollect
with
pleasure
that
i
owe
something
to
the
generosity
of
incredible
pertinacity
exclaimed
my
visitor
with
a
voice
of
perplexity
and
astonishment
what
am
i
to
conceive
of
you
under
what
appearance
shall
i
consider
you
in
the
records
of
my
memory
your
silence
is
the
indication
of
guilt
and
in
that
indication
i
ought
to
acquiesce
yet
the
fortitude
of
your
manner
and
something
i
know
not
what
of
emotion
that
your
manner
produces
in
my
own
bosom
would
fain
persuade
me
you
are
innocent
why
will
you
leave
me
a
prey
to
this
contention
of
thought
if
all
men
constituted
as
i
am
were
to
feel
in
you
as
it
were
the
magnetism
of
innocence
shame
the
simple
inference
of
understanding
and
the
general
sense
of
mankind
would
oblige
them
to
treat
you
as
guilty
what
i
can
however
be
assured
i
will
cheerfully
do
for
you
i
can
not
deliver
you
from
prison
but
i
will
not
fail
to
obtain
the
mitigation
you
ask
farewell
such
was
the
issue
of
my
interview
with
monluc
it
was
clear
that
my
reputation
was
wounded
beyond
the
power
of
remedy
while
the
question
had
only
been
of
a
magistrate
haughty
supercilious
insolent
and
unfeeling
i
flattered
myself
that
the
harshness
of
the
conclusions
that
were
drawn
might
be
ascribed
to
the
depravity
of
his
character
but
monluc
was
the
reverse
of
this
man
he
was
not
less
generous
and
heroic
than
the
magistrate
was
gross
and
illiberal
his
desire
to
relieve
me
was
not
less
apparent
than
the
magistrate
s
eagerness
to
oppress
yet
his
conclusion
was
the
same
and
was
felt
by
me
so
much
the
more
bitterly
in
proportion
to
the
humanity
the
kindness
the
intrepidity
and
the
virtue
of
the
man
from
whom
it
flowed
virtue
and
vice
barbarism
and
refinement
were
equally
engaged
in
the
concert
against
me
and
there
was
no
chance
i
should
triumph
in
a
contention
with
so
many
enemies
i
might
now
be
said
to
have
reached
the
end
of
my
adventure
i
had
closed
one
grand
experiment
upon
the
donation
of
the
stranger
what
had
it
produced
to
me
not
one
atom
of
the
benefits
i
anticipated
not
a
particle
of
those
advantages
which
a
little
while
ago
had
made
the
intoxications
of
my
waking
dreams
its
fruits
had
been
distasteful
and
loathsome
whether
i
looked
to
my
person
my
family
or
my
fame
i
had
felt
in
all
the
miserable
effects
of
this
treacherous
and
delusive
gift
my
person
was
shut
up
in
prison
and
i
was
now
to
make
an
experiment
whether
by
clandestine
and
secret
proceedings
wealth
could
restore
to
me
the
liberty
of
which
wealth
had
deprived
me
my
family
was
blasted
my
wife
was
struck
to
the
heart
and
no
mortal
skill
could
restore
the
wound
she
had
suffered
my
son
was
gone
unaided
into
voluntary
exile
that
he
might
shun
the
contagion
of
my
follies
what
was
i
to
do
with
the
poor
remains
of
my
house
forlorn
dejected
and
wretched
the
wound
my
good
name
had
received
was
of
the
most
decisive
species
when
i
first
encountered
contumely
at
dresden
and
was
called
on
for
explanation
by
coligny
the
difficulties
of
my
condition
struck
anguish
to
my
soul
but
what
were
they
compared
with
what
had
now
overtaken
me
i
was
charged
with
robbery
and
murder
with
every
thing
that
combines
the
whole
species
against
the
perpetrator
and
determines
them
without
sense
of
compunction
to
extirpate
him
from
the
face
of
the
earth
perhaps
it
was
only
by
the
courtesy
of
the
laws
of
this
state
that
i
was
permitted
my
choice
between
an
ignominious
death
and
perpetual
imprisonment
i
might
possibly
indeed
escape
from
my
confinement
i
might
pass
into
a
distant
country
i
might
be
fortunate
enough
to
cut
off
all
connection
between
my
past
and
my
future
life
and
thus
enter
upon
a
new
career
but
this
to
a
man
of
honourable
mind
is
a
miserable
expedient
with
what
feelings
does
he
recollect
that
there
is
a
spot
where
his
name
is
abhorred
where
a
story
is
told
against
him
to
excite
the
wonder
of
the
ignorant
and
the
torpid
feelings
of
the
sluggish
soul
a
story
to
darken
with
new
infamy
the
records
of
guilt
and
to
infect
the
imagination
of
the
solitary
man
with
nameless
horrors
to
be
the
theme
of
such
a
tale
is
no
common
evil
no
matter
how
far
the
man
to
whom
it
relates
shall
remove
from
the
detested
spot
the
spot
itself
with
all
its
chain
of
circumstances
will
often
recur
the
voices
that
repulsed
and
humbled
him
will
ring
in
his
ear
the
degraded
figure
he
made
will
rise
for
ever
fresh
to
his
imagination
he
can
not
ascend
to
any
free
and
lofty
sentiment
he
can
not
attain
the
healthful
tone
of
unblemished
virtue
wherever
he
goes
he
carries
the
arrow
of
disgrace
in
his
bosom
and
when
he
would
erect
his
head
on
high
it
reminds
him
of
the
past
and
stings
him
to
the
heart
if
the
consciousness
of
all
this
would
have
been
painful
to
any
other
man
what
was
it
to
me
who
had
been
brought
up
from
my
infancy
in
the
opinion
that
fame
was
the
first
of
all
human
possessions
and
to
whom
honour
and
an
unimpeached
integrity
had
ever
been
more
necessary
than
my
daily
food
or
than
the
life
which
that
food
supported
what
would
i
not
have
given
could
i
have
returned
to
the
situation
in
which
the
inauspicious
arrival
of
the
stranger
had
found
me
but
that
was
impossible
if
all
that
i
had
recently
passed
through
could
but
have
proved
a
dream
if
i
could
have
awakened
and
freed
myself
from
the
phantoms
of
this
horrible
vision
how
happy
beyond
all
names
of
happiness
should
i
by
such
an
event
have
been
made
what
a
lesson
would
it
have
taught
me
of
the
emptiness
and
futility
of
human
wishes
what
a
sovereign
contempt
would
it
have
impressed
upon
me
for
wealth
and
all
its
train
of
ostentation
how
profound
a
feeling
of
contentment
with
humble
circumstances
and
a
narrow
station
would
it
have
produced
in
my
mind
alas
the
conception
of
those
advantages
and
that
peace
was
the
illusion
and
not
the
evils
i
had
sustained
and
from
which
i
could
not
escape
chapter
xxii
meanwhile
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
make
the
best
of
the
present
circumstances
my
heart
was
wounded
my
spirit
was
in
a
manner
broken
but
not
so
utterly
withered
and
destroyed
as
to
make
me
rest
supine
in
perpetual
imprisonment
i
felt
with
equal
conviction
and
pungency
that
my
character
and
my
happiness
had
sustained
the
deepest
injuries
but
i
felt
it
incumbent
on
me
to
collect
and
improve
the
fragments
that
remained
for
some
days
indeed
after
the
conference
with
monluc
i
was
sunk
in
the
deepest
dejection
but
as
that
dejection
subsided
i
began
to
turn
a
steady
attention
upon
the
future
i
recollected
that
an
eternal
and
inexhaustible
gift
deserved
to
be
made
the
subject
of
more
than
one
experiment
before
a
decision
was
formed
upon
its
merits
i
shall
become
wiser
said
i
as
i
go
forward
experience
however
bitter
will
teach
me
sagacity
and
discrimination
my
next
experiment
shall
be
made
with
more
prudence
and
a
soberer
gradation
i
will
remove
to
some
distant
country
where
the
disadvantages
of
my
past
adventures
shall
not
follow
me
i
will
take
a
new
name
i
shall
then
enjoy
the
benefit
of
a
tyro
just
entering
a
scene
to
all
the
personages
of
which
he
is
wholly
unknown
i
shall
be
like
a
serpent
that
has
stripped
its
tarnished
and
wrinkled
skin
and
comes
forth
in
all
the
gloss
and
sleekness
of
youth
surely
in
an
unknown
land
with
the
prejudice
of
wealth
in
my
favour
and
no
prejudices
against
me
i
shall
know
how
to
conduct
myself
so
as
to
obtain
honour
and
respect
it
is
impossible
that
inexhaustible
wealth
and
immortal
youth
gifts
so
earnestly
coveted
by
every
creature
that
lives
gifts
which
if
i
were
known
to
possess
my
whole
species
from
the
mere
impulses
of
envy
would
probably
combine
to
murder
me
as
not
able
to
endure
the
sight
of
one
so
elevated
above
his
brethren
it
is
impossible
that
such
gifts
should
not
be
pregnant
with
variety
of
joy
marguerite
greatly
contributed
to
raise
me
from
the
dejection
into
which
my
imprisonment
and
the
conference
of
monluc
had
sunk
me
she
was
my
better
genius
i
had
been
so
accustomed
to
receive
consolation
from
her
lips
in
the
most
trying
circumstances
that
now
the
very
sound
of
her
voice
was
able
to
smooth
my
wrinkled
brow
and
calm
my
agitated
spirit
i
listened
as
to
the
sound
of
an
angelic
lyre
i
was
all
ear
i
drank
in
the
accents
of
her
tongue
and
in
the
dear
delight
my
cares
were
hushed
and
my
sorrows
at
an
end
she
talked
to
me
of
her
daughters
whom
she
represented
as
about
to
have
no
protector
but
their
father
she
urged
me
to
watch
over
them
and
to
take
such
steps
as
should
most
conduce
to
their
future
virtue
and
happiness
she
pointed
out
the
practicability
of
escape
and
recommended
to
me
to
fly
to
some
distant
country
the
dreams
of
future
prosperity
from
the
gifts
of
the
stranger
were
not
hers
they
were
all
my
own
it
was
inexpressibly
affecting
at
this
time
to
receive
consolation
from
her
who
had
no
consolation
in
her
own
breast
who
had
bid
farewell
to
all
the
gay
attractions
of
the
world
and
talked
familiarly
of
her
death
as
a
thing
certain
to
happen
in
no
very
long
time
she
had
lost
the
purest
gratifications
of
the
domestic
scene
she
had
lost
her
son
her
heart
was
broken
yet
with
her
dying
accents
she
sought
to
dispel
retrospect
and
inspire
cheerfulness
in
the
breast
of
her
husband
the
reader
may
perhaps
imagine
that
i
was
something
too
sanguine
when
surrounded
with
jailors
and
all
the
precautions
of
a
prison
i
planned
the
nature
and
scene
of
my
next
residence
exactly
as
if
i
had
been
a
person
at
large
but
i
took
it
for
granted
that
the
power
of
money
i
possessed
would
easily
unlock
to
me
the
gates
of
my
captivity
i
believed
that
upon
the
lowest
calculation
personal
liberty
was
clearly
included
among
the
gifts
of
the
stranger
impressed
with
this
opinion
i
fixed
upon
a
negro
a
servant
of
the
prison
and
who
had
the
keys
of
my
apartment
as
the
subject
of
my
pecuniary
experiment
the
idea
of
applying
to
him
had
perhaps
first
occurred
to
me
from
the
mere
circumstance
of
my
seeing
him
more
frequently
than
any
other
attendant
of
the
prison
when
i
thought
further
of
the
matter
i
judged
from
the
meanness
of
his
rank
and
his
apparent
poverty
that
i
could
not
have
chosen
better
so
far
as
related
to
the
sum
to
be
paid
as
the
price
of
my
liberty
it
was
indeed
indifferent
to
me
whether
it
were
large
or
small
i
had
however
suffered
so
much
from
the
inconsiderate
lavishing
of
wealth
that
i
had
no
inclination
on
the
present
occasion
to
make
ostentation
of
more
than
was
necessary
but
what
was
of
most
importance
to
me
i
was
desirous
that
my
first
experiment
should
be
a
successful
one
though
not
unaware
of
the
power
of
gold
i
conceived
that
among
persons
of
middling
rank
and
easier
circumstances
there
might
be
varieties
of
disposition
and
i
might
be
mistaken
in
my
choice
some
might
have
the
whim
of
integrity
or
might
place
a
sturdy
sort
of
pride
in
showing
that
they
were
content
with
what
they
had
and
were
too
high
for
a
bribe
there
might
be
persons
who
though
of
plebeian
rank
might
value
reputation
as
much
as
ever
i
had
done
and
be
of
opinion
that
no
advance
of
station
could
compensate
for
the
name
or
the
consciousness
of
dishonour
these
distinctions
may
seem
an
idle
and
superfluous
refinement
when
it
is
considered
that
i
had
the
power
of
raising
my
bribe
to
the
level
of
any
man
s
honesty
or
pride
be
it
as
great
as
it
might
and
it
may
be
thought
that
my
offer
might
be
so
increased
as
to
be
too
dazzling
for
mortal
firmness
to
resist
be
that
as
it
will
i
am
merely
stating
the
reflections
that
passed
through
my
mind
not
entering
into
their
vindication
taking
the
first
opportunity
then
of
accosting
this
man
when
he
was
alone
with
me
i
addressed
him
thus
my
good
friend
are
not
you
poor
yes
would
not
you
readily
do
me
a
kindness
if
my
master
give
me
leave
i
you
mistake
me
would
you
be
my
friend
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
sir
i
have
been
used
to
call
the
man
i
love
my
friend
if
you
mean
that
you
know
i
can
not
choose
whether
i
will
be
a
man
s
friend
it
comes
of
can
i
not
make
you
my
friend
that
is
make
me
love
you
i
was
surprised
at
the
propriety
of
his
answers
i
am
unable
at
this
distance
of
time
to
recall
the
defects
of
his
language
and
i
disdain
the
mimic
toil
of
inventing
a
jargon
for
him
suitable
to
the
lowness
of
his
condition
the
sense
of
what
he
said
i
faithfully
report
i
had
before
been
struck
with
a
certain
correctness
of
thinking
in
him
but
i
now
examined
his
countenance
more
attentively
than
i
had
ever
before
done
and
thought
i
could
distinctly
trace
in
it
the
indications
of
a
sound
understanding
and
an
excellent
heart
i
do
not
know
sir
continued
he
if
i
see
that
you
are
a
good
man
i
believe
i
shall
love
you
but
if
it
happened
that
you
were
good
and
generous
to
me
i
am
sure
i
should
love
you
very
you
are
very
poor
so
they
tell
me
i
never
had
more
than
a
shilling
or
two
at
a
time
in
my
it
is
a
very
sad
thing
to
be
poor
why
yes
so
i
have
heard
sir
but
for
my
own
part
i
am
always
merry
and
my
good
fellow
i
will
make
you
thank
you
sir
but
what
good
will
that
do
me
you
are
a
servant
i
will
make
you
a
master
of
now
that
i
should
not
like
at
all
i
am
merry
because
i
am
if
i
had
money
and
property
to
take
care
of
and
servants
to
direct
i
am
afraid
they
would
make
me
grave
and
suspicious
and
in
every
respect
unlike
what
you
see
is
it
possible
you
should
be
pleased
with
your
present
situation
under
the
orders
of
one
man
in
a
house
and
obliged
to
play
the
tyrant
to
the
rest
why
as
you
say
sir
there
may
be
more
agreeable
situations
than
the
life
of
a
jail
but
as
to
being
under
orders
i
have
no
objection
to
that
i
never
knew
any
other
condition
and
therefore
i
am
contented
it
is
not
pleasant
indeed
to
have
a
master
who
is
always
scolding
and
dissatisfied
but
the
gentleman
i
serve
at
present
is
reasonable
i
know
how
to
content
him
and
when
i
have
done
that
he
leaves
me
to
please
myself
you
offer
me
money
now
sir
that
is
not
what
i
call
being
generous
i
count
nothing
for
much
except
when
a
man
shows
me
has
bowels
and
convinces
me
that
he
thinks
justice
due
even
to
a
negro
i
dare
say
however
you
designed
it
for
generosity
and
expected
something
from
me
in
return
tell
me
what
it
is
you
want
and
whatever
i
can
do
with
propriety
you
may
depend
on
it
i
do
you
approve
of
a
man
s
being
deprived
of
his
liberty
will
you
please
to
tell
me
what
you
mean
by
liberty
you
offered
me
just
now
what
you
called
liberty
and
independence
and
i
am
content
to
be
a
would
you
be
pleased
instead
of
being
a
turnkey
to
have
the
key
turned
on
yourself
that
i
should
not
i
understand
the
disagreeableness
of
that
well
enough
for
when
i
first
entered
this
place
it
was
as
a
if
then
my
good
fellow
you
were
convinced
that
i
was
a
man
disposed
to
be
generous
to
you
in
your
own
way
and
to
deserve
your
attachment
and
love
surely
you
would
not
refuse
to
deliver
me
from
a
situation
which
you
have
yourself
felt
to
be
so
disagreeable
and
i
understand
you
now
sir
i
have
already
a
master
with
whom
i
am
satisfied
and
i
do
not
wish
to
change
my
service
when
i
was
a
prisoner
he
found
out
that
i
was
innocent
he
got
me
cleared
and
gave
me
employment
i
am
put
here
for
the
express
purpose
of
seeing
the
prisoners
in
safe
custody
that
is
the
contract
between
me
and
my
master
when
i
took
the
keys
by
that
action
i
pledged
myself
to
be
faithful
to
my
trust
and
the
nobleness
of
my
master
s
behaviour
to
me
in
removing
me
from
being
a
prisoner
to
be
a
free
servant
is
a
double
bond
upon
my
fidelity
i
would
sooner
consent
to
be
torn
limb
from
limb
than
fail
in
what
is
expected
from
me
you
may
be
generous
to
a
harmless
stranger
you
have
most
reason
to
be
generous
to
a
man
you
love
but
if
you
would
heap
benefits
upon
me
merely
because
i
proved
myself
a
villain
i
can
only
say
it
would
be
disgraceful
to
be
the
object
of
your
thus
saying
he
quitted
me
and
withdrew
from
further
parley
the
conversation
in
which
we
had
engaged
though
i
had
had
considerable
experience
in
the
world
was
altogether
new
to
me
and
overwhelmed
me
with
astonishment
i
found
in
this
trial
that
the
power
of
money
was
subject
to
limitations
of
which
previously
i
had
not
been
in
the
slightest
degree
aware
i
thought
that
nothing
but
the
most
extraordinary
degree
of
resolution
and
could
enable
a
man
to
resist
its
enticements
and
i
had
even
been
told
though
i
did
not
believe
that
every
man
had
his
price
and
a
bribe
capable
of
indefinite
augmentation
must
be
in
all
cases
victorious
yet
here
was
a
poor
creature
utterly
exempt
from
its
operation
he
had
no
sense
of
those
attractions
which
so
often
degrade
the
best
and
convert
virtue
into
the
most
shameless
profligacy
it
cost
him
no
effort
to
be
honest
and
he
uttered
sentiments
that
would
have
given
lustre
to
the
most
heroic
character
without
any
consciousness
of
their
greatness
what
i
had
seen
led
me
also
to
reflect
on
another
singularity
i
discerned
in
him
in
the
midst
of
the
admirable
i
had
almost
said
the
sublime
integrity
he
discovered
for
is
it
not
a
criterion
of
the
sublime
to
be
great
without
an
effort
he
was
destitute
of
knowledge
of
intellectual
cultivation
and
all
those
exquisite
sensations
that
most
distinguish
the
man
from
the
brute
he
passed
on
quietly
in
the
road
of
ordinary
life
and
thought
not
of
the
ambition
to
be
wise
or
great
to
be
honoured
by
thousands
or
a
benefactor
to
ages
yet
unborn
kings
might
have
confessed
their
inferiority
to
this
man
but
is
he
to
be
regarded
as
the
model
of
what
a
human
creature
should
be
wished
to
be
oh
no
but
the
most
memorable
feeling
impressed
upon
me
by
this
conversation
was
a
conviction
of
what
i
had
been
backward
to
confess
that
knaves
were
the
persons
to
whose
assistance
and
concert
i
must
look
and
that
i
must
be
upon
my
guard
against
an
honest
man
no
one
was
qualified
to
be
my
coadjutor
till
he
had
proved
himself
unworthy
of
all
just
and
honourable
society
the
friend
i
must
seek
was
a
man
whose
very
soul
melted
at
a
bribe
whom
money
would
seduce
to
perpetrate
whatever
his
judgment
most
abhorred
honour
and
integrity
in
the
most
refined
and
the
rudest
state
monluc
and
the
negro
both
refused
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
a
sensation
more
painful
and
humiliating
than
was
this
conviction
to
my
mind
i
was
not
long
at
leisure
for
these
reflections
in
a
few
minutes
the
master
of
the
prison
entered
my
apartment
and
with
him
the
negro
whom
i
had
endeavoured
to
prevail
on
to
assist
in
restoring
me
to
liberty
the
master
began
to
reproach
me
in
very
harsh
terms
for
attempting
to
seduce
his
servant
from
his
duty
and
asked
me
what
sort
of
enjoyment
or
satisfaction
a
man
could
have
in
life
if
he
could
not
depend
upon
the
people
he
put
into
his
employment
to
this
i
answered
with
sternness
that
i
should
hold
no
debate
about
right
and
wrong
with
a
jailor
that
he
might
depend
upon
it
i
would
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
set
myself
free
and
what
was
more
that
i
would
be
free
and
that
for
his
part
it
was
his
business
to
keep
me
if
he
could
but
not
to
insult
i
therefore
insisted
upon
his
quitting
the
room
what
use
replied
the
fellow
do
you
think
now
there
is
in
putting
yourself
in
a
passion
if
i
have
not
a
right
to
speak
to
you
i
know
what
i
have
a
right
to
do
put
you
in
the
strong
room
and
load
you
with
i
turned
my
back
upon
him
and
how
came
you
said
i
to
the
negro
to
go
and
betray
me
i
should
have
expected
better
things
of
you
if
you
refused
to
serve
me
at
least
you
needed
not
have
endeavoured
to
hurt
i
did
nothing
but
my
duty
sir
i
have
no
wish
to
hurt
you
but
it
is
my
business
not
merely
to
take
care
of
my
master
s
interests
myself
but
to
see
that
they
are
not
injured
by
any
body
else
if
he
was
not
put
on
his
guard
you
might
have
been
more
successful
with
the
next
turnkey
you
endeavoured
to
you
will
find
it
more
to
your
interest
monsieur
interposed
the
jailor
to
talk
to
me
than
to
my
servant
you
are
determined
to
be
free
you
say
if
that
is
the
case
and
it
is
to
happen
who
has
so
good
a
right
to
benefit
by
your
resolution
as
i
have
my
eyes
were
opened
in
a
moment
i
saw
that
the
knave
whose
rigour
and
sternness
could
not
hold
out
against
the
warmth
of
a
bribe
the
friend
of
whose
assistance
i
was
in
want
stood
before
me
i
do
not
wonder
proceeded
he
that
you
preferred
applying
to
one
of
my
servants
their
honesty
must
be
expected
to
be
had
at
a
cheaper
market
but
for
my
part
i
am
determined
that
no
man
shall
ever
pass
these
walls
without
my
being
the
richer
if
then
your
escape
is
a
thing
that
must
happen
let
us
see
what
you
can
afford
to
give
me
for
dear
master
interposed
the
negro
you
surely
will
not
listen
to
the
gentleman
s
offer
when
i
refused
to
betray
my
trust
it
is
impossible
you
should
consent
to
betray
yours
hold
your
tongue
blockhead
said
the
other
do
not
you
see
that
monsieur
is
determined
to
escape
i
know
he
is
rich
though
you
have
refused
a
bribe
i
am
sure
that
all
your
fellows
will
not
the
thing
will
happen
sooner
or
later
in
spite
of
every
thing
i
can
do
and
there
can
be
no
harm
in
my
helping
to
bring
about
what
it
is
impossible
i
should
a
morality
like
this
seems
exactly
in
its
place
in
the
breast
of
a
jailor
we
had
already
made
some
progress
in
adjusting
the
terms
of
our
contract
when
the
keeper
of
the
prison
interposed
but
monsieur
you
will
please
to
remark
that
this
is
an
affair
which
will
be
attended
with
difficulty
whatever
passes
between
you
and
me
must
be
a
secret
your
escape
will
be
a
thing
open
and
notorious
and
you
must
have
a
confederate
that
i
may
not
bear
the
blame
of
it
you
must
therefore
take
my
black
here
along
with
you
that
his
flight
may
cause
all
the
blame
to
fall
upon
o
pray
master
said
the
negro
do
not
part
with
me
i
love
you
and
will
do
any
thing
in
the
world
if
you
will
let
me
stay
you
saved
my
life
for
aught
i
know
and
made
a
man
of
me
again
you
can
not
think
what
good
it
does
me
to
serve
a
master
that
has
been
so
kind
to
me
get
you
gone
replied
his
owner
you
are
of
no
use
to
me
you
are
not
fit
for
a
jail
you
are
so
simple
i
can
not
tell
what
to
do
with
you
indeed
i
do
not
like
to
go
with
this
gentleman
it
will
break
my
heart
he
said
he
would
be
generous
and
kind
to
me
if
i
turned
a
villain
i
shall
never
be
able
and
shall
never
desire
to
earn
his
kindness
but
you
rewarded
me
because
i
was
innocent
he
said
he
would
make
a
master
of
me
and
i
am
better
as
i
am
i
had
much
rather
be
a
the
difficulties
of
this
poor
fellow
were
soon
silenced
by
the
peremptoriness
of
his
master
the
jailor
told
him
that
he
would
do
him
a
great
service
by
thus
giving
his
master
an
opportunity
of
representing
him
as
the
traitor
and
with
this
consideration
the
negro
dried
his
tears
and
with
a
reluctant
heart
consented
to
accompany
me
thus
were
his
exemplary
fidelity
and
affection
rewarded
so
little
do
some
men
seem
capable
of
feeling
the
value
of
attachment
the
character
of
the
master
was
a
singular
one
the
meanness
and
mercenariness
of
his
spirit
were
unredeemed
by
a
single
virtue
he
was
avarice
personified
but
he
had
found
or
imagined
an
interest
in
taking
this
negro
who
had
been
want
only
thrown
into
prison
by
a
former
tyrant
for
his
servant
and
this
the
poor
fellow
in
the
simplicity
of
his
heart
had
mistaken
for
an
act
of
exalted
generosity
his
avarice
had
swallowed
up
all
his
other
passions
and
his
servants
had
neither
impatience
nor
insolence
to
encounter
from
him
weighed
therefore
in
the
balance
of
the
negro
s
experience
he
appeared
a
miracle
of
mildness
and
benevolence
our
bargain
was
at
length
concluded
and
the
next
time
marguerite
came
to
visit
me
i
announced
to
her
the
success
of
my
negotiation
before
we
parted
we
sent
for
the
jailor
and
discussed
with
him
the
road
i
should
take
my
purpose
was
to
pass
into
italy
and
marguerite
undertook
by
midnight
to
have
every
thing
prepared
to
convey
us
to
the
foot
of
the
mountains
this
point
being
adjusted
the
keeper
of
the
prison
left
us
and
tenderly
embracing
marguerite
i
besought
her
to
congratulate
me
upon
the
recovery
of
my
liberty
she
had
heard
however
of
the
infamous
nature
of
the
charge
against
me
and
though
she
yielded
it
no
credit
i
could
easily
perceive
that
it
rendered
yet
heavier
the
depression
under
which
she
laboured
she
returned
my
embrace
the
tears
stole
down
her
cheeks
but
she
was
silent
i
endeavoured
to
divert
her
thoughts
and
her
spirits
by
hinting
at
the
new
scenes
before
us
and
the
distant
country
to
which
we
were
about
to
remove
but
in
vain
i
will
not
reproach
you
reginald
said
she
i
will
not
desert
my
duty
while
i
have
power
to
perform
it
you
may
depend
upon
my
doing
every
thing
i
am
able
both
for
the
children
and
yourself
she
left
me
in
a
very
melancholy
frame
of
mind
i
had
not
expected
to
see
her
thus
languid
and
disconsolate
and
upon
the
eve
of
my
liberation
i
felt
it
like
caprice
incomparable
woman
she
was
incapable
of
giving
intentional
pain
but
with
her
exquisitely
susceptible
mind
she
was
unable
to
support
the
dreadful
reverse
in
which
i
had
involved
her
or
even
at
times
to
assume
the
gestures
of
cheerfulness
and
tranquillity
gestures
that
at
the
best
but
ill
disguised
the
grief
within
i
was
busily
reflecting
on
what
had
just
occurred
when
the
keeper
of
the
prison
my
apartment
i
am
come
monsieur
said
he
to
take
my
leave
of
you
as
i
do
not
at
all
intend
to
lose
my
place
it
is
not
proper
that
i
should
see
you
any
more
you
understand
me
two
days
had
already
elapsed
since
the
conclusion
of
our
contract
and
i
had
provided
myself
for
this
and
such
other
demands
as
seemed
likely
to
be
immediately
impending
i
should
have
preferred
indeed
to
have
delayed
this
payment
till
the
moment
of
my
departure
but
what
the
jailor
suggested
appeared
reasonable
and
i
could
not
assign
even
to
my
own
mind
any
cause
why
i
should
be
reluctant
to
comply
with
it
i
paid
to
this
wretch
the
price
of
his
villany
i
now
began
to
count
the
hours
and
eagerly
to
anticipate
the
arrival
of
midnight
though
the
moment
of
my
liberty
was
so
near
i
yet
contemplated
with
unspeakable
loathing
the
scene
of
my
confinement
which
was
associated
with
the
deepest
disgrace
and
the
blackest
charges
that
are
incident
to
a
human
creature
i
felt
as
if
in
proportion
as
i
removed
from
the
hated
spot
i
should
at
least
shake
off
a
part
of
the
burthen
that
oppressed
me
and
grow
comparatively
young
again
time
was
far
from
moving
indeed
with
the
rapidity
my
impatience
required
but
the
hour
of
appointment
at
last
was
near
and
i
expected
every
moment
the
faithful
negro
to
appear
and
announce
to
me
my
freedom
the
cathedral
bell
now
sounded
twelve
i
heard
the
noise
of
steps
along
the
gallery
and
presently
a
key
was
applied
to
the
door
of
my
apartment
it
opened
and
three
persons
whom
i
knew
for
servants
of
the
prison
entered
come
sir
said
one
of
them
you
must
follow
where
is
my
friend
the
negro
said
i
ask
no
questions
speak
never
a
word
but
it
was
strange
that
the
master
of
the
prison
whose
temper
was
so
full
of
anxiety
and
caution
should
unnecessarily
trust
three
of
his
people
who
might
easily
have
been
kept
ignorant
of
this
hazardous
secret
this
circumstance
however
did
not
strike
me
at
first
so
strongly
as
it
ought
to
have
done
i
had
perfect
confidence
in
his
fidelity
to
his
profligate
bargain
and
expected
every
moment
to
meet
the
negro
who
was
to
be
my
guide
my
conductors
led
me
by
a
way
which
i
soon
perceived
did
not
lead
to
the
ordinary
entrance
of
the
prison
where
are
we
going
said
i
hold
your
tongue
or
you
will
spoil
all
replied
one
of
them
roughly
i
bethought
me
that
there
might
be
an
objection
to
the
dismissing
me
by
the
public
gate
i
recollected
to
have
heard
that
there
were
several
subterranean
outlets
to
the
citadel
i
judged
from
the
words
i
had
just
heard
that
my
conductors
were
acquainted
with
the
plan
that
had
been
formed
and
for
all
these
reasons
i
proceeded
with
tolerable
ease
and
security
i
was
not
much
longer
however
permitted
to
doubt
i
was
conducted
to
one
of
the
dungeons
of
the
prison
and
told
that
there
i
was
to
remain
at
first
i
remonstrated
loudly
and
told
them
that
i
had
been
promised
my
liberty
and
not
a
treatment
like
we
know
that
sir
replied
they
and
that
is
the
reason
you
are
brought
here
it
is
our
business
to
teach
you
that
the
greatest
offence
that
can
be
committed
by
a
man
in
prison
is
to
attempt
to
the
shock
and
surprise
that
so
unexpected
an
issue
to
my
adventure
produced
rendered
me
outrageous
i
was
no
longer
able
to
control
my
fury
and
without
knowing
what
i
proposed
i
knocked
down
two
of
my
attendants
before
they
had
an
opportunity
to
secure
me
and
rushed
up
the
flight
of
steps
by
which
we
had
descended
the
third
however
contrived
to
intercept
me
and
while
we
struggled
the
other
two
came
to
his
assistance
they
loaded
me
with
fetters
and
chained
me
to
the
wall
i
was
then
left
in
utter
darkness
i
felt
myself
sore
with
the
bruises
i
had
received
in
the
contest
but
what
was
infinitely
worse
i
found
the
expectations
of
freedom
i
had
so
confidently
entertained
baffled
and
disappointed
marguerite
and
my
children
were
at
this
moment
waiting
for
me
to
join
them
they
would
probably
wait
hour
after
hour
in
vain
to
what
cause
would
they
attribute
my
failing
of
my
appointment
to
what
cause
was
i
myself
to
attribute
my
miscarriage
my
hopes
in
this
instance
had
been
in
the
utmost
degree
sanguine
what
was
i
to
count
upon
for
the
future
was
money
useless
in
every
instance
in
which
mankind
agreed
to
think
its
power
unquestionable
what
was
the
source
of
the
present
catastrophe
and
the
harsh
treatment
i
endured
was
the
keeper
of
the
prison
discovered
and
dismissed
from
his
office
had
the
negro
gone
and
given
information
against
him
i
formed
a
thousand
conjectures
as
to
what
might
have
happened
but
i
was
unable
to
rest
in
any
i
had
remained
about
twelve
hours
in
this
situation
full
of
angry
and
disconsolate
thoughts
when
the
principal
jailor
entered
my
dungeon
i
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
the
cloud
vanished
from
my
understanding
and
i
began
to
comprehend
the
solution
of
the
enigma
are
you
at
large
cried
i
with
indignation
why
then
am
i
here
you
are
here
by
my
execrable
villain
said
i
did
you
not
promise
me
my
freedom
have
you
not
received
the
price
of
it
how
dare
you
show
yourself
in
my
presence
as
i
spoke
i
shook
my
chains
i
clenched
my
fists
i
trembled
with
resentment
and
rage
if
you
are
not
perfectly
quiet
and
reasonable
said
he
i
shall
leave
you
to
your
fate
and
return
no
nothing
is
more
singular
in
a
state
of
great
mental
effervescence
than
the
rapidity
with
which
our
ideas
succeed
each
other
at
such
times
we
seem
to
think
more
in
minutes
than
at
other
times
in
hours
i
felt
how
miserable
a
slave
a
man
is
the
moment
he
falls
completely
into
the
power
of
another
the
wretch
who
stood
before
me
was
more
vacant
of
human
affections
than
any
one
i
ever
saw
yet
i
was
his
creature
to
be
moulded
as
he
pleased
a
thousand
injuries
he
could
inflict
upon
me
for
which
neither
the
institutions
of
society
nor
the
extraordinary
endowments
i
derived
from
the
stranger
could
afford
a
remedy
he
might
so
torture
my
mind
and
baffle
my
wishes
as
to
kill
in
me
every
spark
of
lofty
adventure
and
generous
pride
my
liberty
might
for
aught
i
knew
be
for
years
at
his
disposal
i
felt
however
that
my
best
course
was
to
regard
him
with
contempt
and
use
him
as
i
would
a
spade
or
a
file
to
execute
my
purposes
without
suffering
him
to
awaken
my
passions
i
immediately
grew
more
calm
and
he
perceived
the
revolution
of
my
sentiments
you
seem
to
wonder
continued
he
that
i
did
not
keep
my
engagement
with
you
i
pride
myself
upon
being
superior
to
the
prejudices
by
which
other
men
are
frightened
like
children
with
a
bugbear
i
have
therefore
no
rule
but
my
interest
and
i
did
not
see
how
my
interest
bound
me
to
keep
my
engagement
with
and
what
became
of
the
countess
i
neither
know
nor
care
i
suppose
she
stayed
all
night
under
the
walls
i
knew
she
durst
not
disturb
the
i
felt
i
had
still
emotions
to
suppress
i
curbed
my
tongue
but
they
showed
themselves
in
my
eyes
how
do
you
intend
to
dispose
of
me
keep
you
in
close
custody
i
have
got
your
thousand
pounds
the
next
thing
for
me
to
take
care
of
is
that
i
do
not
lose
my
and
for
what
purpose
do
you
come
to
me
now
why
to
tell
you
a
secret
i
have
not
quite
determined
what
conduct
to
pursue
and
therefore
i
came
here
that
i
might
have
a
better
opportunity
of
are
you
not
afraid
that
i
should
inform
the
government
how
you
have
cheated
me
you
inform
have
not
i
got
you
under
lock
and
key
i
warrant
you
i
will
take
care
what
goes
out
of
these
walls
to
the
the
countess
has
a
licence
to
visit
what
care
i
for
that
i
can
keep
her
at
bay
as
long
as
i
will
she
will
not
easily
go
to
the
government
and
she
is
not
such
a
fool
as
not
to
know
that
to
lodge
a
complaint
against
me
is
not
the
way
to
procure
the
liberty
of
a
man
condemned
to
perpetual
imprisonment
i
can
at
any
time
trump
up
a
story
of
your
attempting
to
corrupt
the
turnkeys
and
be
sure
when
i
do
i
will
not
want
for
proofs
that
will
cover
any
thing
i
can
do
to
annoy
you
and
answer
any
accusation
you
can
make
against
me
do
you
think
that
the
word
of
a
jailor
will
not
be
taken
before
that
of
the
murderer
he
has
in
custody
i
can
bring
your
own
servants
as
witnesses
three
of
whom
assaulted
me
last
dunce
do
you
think
i
trusted
them
with
my
secret
they
have
nothing
to
tell
and
apprehend
nothing
but
a
plot
between
you
and
my
black
who
has
been
put
into
the
penitentiary
for
his
offence
he
is
my
only
confident
and
i
trust
him
because
his
stupidity
answers
to
me
for
his
suppose
i
were
to
double
the
bribe
for
which
you
sold
me
my
liberty
what
security
should
i
have
that
you
would
abide
by
your
bargain
oh
if
you
were
to
do
that
it
would
alter
the
might
you
not
then
detain
the
money
and
defy
me
as
you
have
done
now
suppose
that
a
thing
which
might
happen
can
you
help
yourself
can
you
do
better
i
saw
there
was
no
remedy
and
i
was
constrained
to
allow
the
success
of
this
twofold
perfidy
it
was
with
an
ill
grace
and
an
attempt
at
sullenness
and
indifference
that
the
jailor
accepted
my
proposal
the
second
thousand
however
had
irresistible
charms
and
in
spite
of
himself
the
sensation
that
made
his
heart
dance
relaxed
his
muscles
and
played
about
his
mouth
he
was
puzzled
what
to
think
of
me
the
facility
with
which
i
produced
the
sums
he
demanded
with
less
apparent
effort
than
they
might
have
come
from
a
duke
or
a
sovereign
prince
startled
and
staggered
him
he
had
still
his
qualms
and
evidently
doubted
whether
he
should
not
raise
his
price
a
third
time
i
saw
no
safety
but
in
pertinacity
and
firmness
and
had
the
good
fortune
ultimately
to
check
his
doubtful
experiments
i
was
led
by
the
accidents
which
have
just
been
related
into
further
and
deeper
reflections
on
the
power
of
money
as
well
as
on
the
nature
of
the
situation
in
which
i
found
myself
placed
by
the
legacy
of
the
stranger
my
present
experiment
had
been
made
upon
a
subject
apparently
the
most
favourable
that
could
have
been
devised
upon
a
man
whose
breast
the
love
of
gold
occupied
without
a
rival
yet
with
this
man
i
very
hardly
succeeded
i
was
not
indeed
so
blinded
by
the
present
dejection
of
my
spirit
and
sickness
of
my
heart
as
to
imagine
that
i
had
not
a
secure
game
with
this
wretch
if
i
consented
to
play
it
i
had
only
to
enlarge
my
bribe
to
change
it
from
the
limited
sum
of
two
thousand
pounds
to
the
more
brilliant
offer
of
two
thousand
per
annum
and
no
doubt
i
might
have
led
him
with
me
to
the
extremity
of
the
globe
however
he
might
have
demurred
however
he
might
have
doubted
however
curiosity
whetted
even
to
agony
by
the
goadings
of
avarice
might
have
prompted
him
to
an
incessant
enquiry
within
himself
as
to
the
solution
of
my
character
and
my
powers
his
grasping
spirit
would
infallibly
have
chained
his
tongue
and
been
surety
for
his
fidelity
but
i
could
not
yet
prevail
upon
myself
to
endow
such
groveling
and
noxious
propensities
with
so
rich
a
reward
i
considered
in
the
language
of
the
stranger
that
the
talent
i
possessed
was
of
the
most
momentous
nature
and
bestowed
by
the
governor
of
the
universe
for
the
highest
purposes
and
i
should
have
held
myself
unjustifiable
in
enriching
by
its
means
however
urgent
the
necessity
might
appear
the
most
worthless
of
mankind
the
sentiments
of
my
tyrant
varied
every
hour
he
was
fickle
anxious
and
undetermined
harassed
with
the
double
fear
of
losing
the
sum
already
obtained
and
of
not
securing
the
whole
of
what
was
capable
of
being
acquired
he
parted
with
me
at
last
with
all
the
pangs
of
a
lover
who
witnesses
the
ceremony
of
his
mistress
s
taking
the
monastic
veil
and
being
sundered
from
him
for
ever
i
was
his
fortunatus
s
purse
and
this
was
the
last
day
he
was
to
enjoy
the
use
of
it
i
was
to
him
as
the
buried
treasure
of
some
hoarder
and
he
feared
he
should
quit
his
digging
before
he
had
carried
off
every
thing
that
the
field
concealed
at
length
however
he
began
to
apprehend
that
he
had
urged
the
refinement
of
an
unprincipled
avarice
as
far
as
it
would
go
and
therefore
in
a
few
days
the
negro
being
already
discharged
from
his
penance
he
suffered
us
to
escape
together
chapter
xxiii
having
rejoined
the
remainder
of
my
family
we
set
out
together
for
the
plains
of
italy
my
first
interview
with
marguerite
after
my
return
from
dresden
had
been
melancholy
but
our
situation
was
now
such
as
to
give
additional
anguish
to
her
serious
thoughts
she
had
then
regarded
me
as
ambiguous
mysterious
and
impenetrable
qualities
from
which
the
frankness
of
her
nature
spontaneously
revolted
she
saw
in
me
the
destroyer
of
her
son
the
idol
of
her
heart
she
believed
me
an
alchymist
a
character
which
she
viewed
as
base
degrading
and
insensible
she
had
heard
that
rumour
had
been
busy
with
my
fame
but
now
she
saw
in
me
a
man
of
blasted
reputation
arraigned
and
imprisoned
for
robbery
and
murder
she
did
not
credit
these
imputations
but
did
the
ingenuous
and
marguerite
de
damville
ever
think
to
find
herself
allied
to
a
being
thus
loaded
with
the
world
s
abhorrence
that
she
should
be
compelled
to
honour
with
the
sacred
name
of
husband
a
fugitive
a
and
an
outlaw
if
i
had
suffered
these
things
in
the
defence
of
my
children
my
religion
or
my
country
the
case
would
have
been
widely
different
if
while
encountering
the
contempt
of
men
i
had
carried
within
me
the
glorious
feeling
that
what
they
regarded
as
my
disgrace
was
indeed
my
immortal
honour
marguerite
de
damville
beyond
all
women
was
prepared
to
despise
their
senseless
blame
and
proudly
to
demand
her
share
in
such
a
dishonour
i
know
there
are
men
who
will
listen
with
fretful
impatience
to
a
detail
of
such
sorrows
as
hers
and
who
will
cry
out
if
we
must
be
distressed
give
us
more
substantial
and
genuine
sources
of
distress
they
will
regard
the
dejection
of
marguerite
as
an
idle
wilfulness
of
grief
better
entitled
to
aversion
than
to
sympathy
and
will
tell
me
that
nothing
but
the
most
deplorable
blindness
could
have
prevented
her
from
discerning
the
happiness
of
her
condition
that
she
had
the
world
before
her
a
rich
a
brave
and
an
enterprising
husband
with
a
lovely
family
of
children
that
they
could
move
from
country
to
country
and
from
climate
to
climate
carrying
with
them
the
means
of
luxury
indulgence
homage
and
usefulness
to
such
moralisers
i
write
not
for
those
who
are
incapable
of
sympathising
with
the
delicate
sensations
of
marguerite
i
am
as
little
qualified
to
enter
into
their
feelings
as
they
into
mine
in
the
sequel
of
the
story
however
it
is
not
impossible
they
may
meet
with
their
gratification
i
am
hastening
to
events
corporeal
and
palpable
i
and
my
family
did
wander
from
country
to
country
and
from
climate
to
climate
with
what
resulting
success
will
speedily
be
seen
our
destination
at
the
present
moment
led
us
through
the
territory
of
the
grisons
and
over
a
limb
of
the
rhetian
alps
to
como
milan
piacenza
parma
and
pisa
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
latter
city
we
resolved
to
take
up
our
immediate
residence
in
this
passage
we
met
with
few
adventures
that
merit
to
be
recorded
in
my
history
one
however
seems
entitled
to
a
place
both
as
it
tends
to
display
the
singular
worth
of
a
dumb
and
unpretending
brute
and
as
it
is
in
some
sort
connected
with
the
fortunes
i
encountered
in
the
pisan
territory
it
occurred
in
our
journey
over
the
alps
one
evening
in
the
wildest
and
most
desolate
part
of
the
mountain
after
having
lodged
my
family
in
an
inn
i
wandered
forth
to
take
a
survey
of
the
neighbouring
scenery
it
was
moonlight
our
travel
of
the
day
had
been
short
and
had
left
on
me
no
impression
of
fatigue
while
the
romantic
appearance
of
every
thing
around
tempted
me
to
extend
my
excursion
further
than
i
had
originally
purposed
stories
of
robberies
and
murders
in
the
vicinity
had
been
repeated
to
us
and
marguerite
had
employed
the
precaution
of
desiring
hector
such
was
the
name
which
the
caprice
of
his
former
masters
had
bestowed
on
my
faithful
negro
to
follow
my
steps
and
hold
me
in
sight
no
anticipations
of
danger
however
disturbed
my
contemplations
i
resigned
myself
as
all
my
life
i
had
been
accustomed
to
do
to
the
impressions
of
the
moment
and
sought
to
shut
out
memory
and
the
world
from
all
my
thoughts
the
scene
was
inexpressibly
beautiful
the
silence
was
uninterrupted
and
awful
the
splendour
of
the
moon
gave
a
sober
and
silvery
tint
to
every
thing
by
which
its
light
was
caught
soft
white
clouds
were
scattered
in
the
deep
azure
of
the
sky
the
shades
were
of
a
blackness
and
profundity
that
could
not
be
surpassed
every
thing
was
calculated
to
soothe
and
subdue
the
mind
to
inspire
a
grand
and
expansive
tranquillity
the
enthusiasm
it
spoke
occupied
every
channel
of
my
heart
i
stood
still
it
seemed
as
if
motion
would
have
jarred
and
broken
the
spell
that
seized
me
i
yielded
with
eager
transport
to
the
sentiment
that
shrowded
and
enveloped
me
in
its
ample
embrace
i
had
remained
motionless
for
above
half
an
hour
when
a
sudden
and
eager
sound
burst
upon
my
ear
it
seemed
to
be
the
shriek
of
some
human
creature
in
distress
it
was
repeated
several
times
my
first
impulse
was
to
fly
to
the
spot
from
which
the
sound
appeared
to
proceed
meanwhile
hector
came
up
to
me
and
endeavoured
to
detain
me
by
violence
his
first
principle
was
obedience
to
every
just
and
lawful
command
and
the
errand
upon
which
he
was
commissioned
was
to
preserve
me
from
the
approach
of
danger
he
represented
to
me
the
stories
of
banditti
we
had
recently
heard
he
told
me
that
we
should
too
probably
fall
in
with
a
numerous
party
of
these
desperadoes
against
whom
all
our
efforts
either
for
ourselves
or
for
those
i
was
desirous
to
succour
would
be
nugatory
what
would
become
of
my
children
what
would
become
of
his
mistress
if
my
rashness
were
succeeded
by
a
fatal
event
while
he
was
thus
speaking
and
exerting
himself
to
detain
me
the
cries
ceased
i
believed
they
were
those
of
a
person
assassinated
i
conceived
that
i
should
be
the
vilest
of
poltroons
if
i
suffered
any
consideration
to
prevent
me
from
endeavouring
to
afford
to
this
unfortunate
the
relief
in
my
power
i
had
not
advanced
far
before
i
perceived
coming
towards
us
in
the
same
direction
from
which
the
sound
had
reached
my
ear
a
dog
entirely
black
and
of
uncommon
stature
and
strength
he
was
alone
having
caught
sight
of
us
he
increased
his
pace
and
had
no
sooner
reached
the
spot
on
which
we
stood
than
he
seized
the
flap
of
my
coat
and
pulled
it
with
considerable
violence
i
was
somewhat
alarmed
at
his
size
and
action
the
latter
of
which
i
apprehended
to
have
a
hostile
design
and
having
shaken
him
off
i
put
myself
in
a
posture
of
defence
with
a
cane
that
i
carried
in
my
hand
undeterred
however
by
my
gesture
he
returned
to
the
attack
only
pulling
with
something
less
exertion
of
strength
than
he
had
done
before
more
accurate
attention
convinced
me
that
he
had
no
intention
to
injure
me
and
i
withheld
the
action
of
hector
who
had
raised
his
hand
to
strike
in
defence
of
his
master
i
suffered
him
to
guide
me
and
after
a
considerable
circuit
which
the
nature
of
the
road
obliged
us
to
take
he
led
me
to
a
spot
where
i
found
a
man
lying
on
the
ground
and
weltering
in
his
blood
but
with
no
person
near
to
whom
to
impute
the
violence
he
had
sustained
his
blood
flowed
copiously
from
two
or
three
different
wounds
one
of
them
in
particular
near
his
left
breast
and
my
first
care
was
to
stop
the
effusion
for
this
purpose
we
stripped
him
of
his
clothes
and
tore
his
linen
into
bandages
when
we
found
him
he
was
insensible
but
the
anguish
of
binding
his
wounds
revived
him
a
little
though
only
enough
to
extort
from
him
sighs
and
groans
this
accomplished
i
dismissed
hector
to
the
inn
to
procure
something
in
the
nature
of
a
litter
by
which
he
might
more
easily
be
conveyed
within
reach
of
effectual
assistance
i
was
now
left
for
six
hours
with
no
other
companions
than
the
wounded
gentleman
and
his
dog
upon
the
very
spot
upon
which
he
had
just
before
sustained
so
ferocious
a
treatment
probably
from
the
hands
of
banditti
they
might
every
moment
be
expected
to
return
this
was
no
agreeable
notion
to
a
person
circumstanced
as
i
was
i
was
compelled
to
feel
that
a
man
possessed
of
boundless
and
illimitable
wealth
and
of
the
power
of
repelling
old
age
and
disease
did
not
in
these
advantages
possess
every
thing
notwithstanding
the
disappointments
and
mortifications
i
had
sustained
i
was
yet
attached
to
life
and
though
the
bequests
of
the
stranger
had
hitherto
produced
to
me
nothing
but
evil
i
still
looked
with
almost
puerile
eagerness
and
beating
of
heart
for
the
time
when
i
might
spread
out
the
whole
extent
of
my
treasures
without
parsimony
or
the
dread
of
reverse
during
the
interval
which
i
employed
in
these
reflections
the
wounded
man
was
for
the
most
part
in
a
state
of
insensibility
and
constantly
speechless
i
expected
his
death
every
moment
and
i
perceived
as
i
thought
with
certainty
that
there
was
no
hope
of
his
recovery
while
we
had
dressed
his
wounds
the
dog
had
watched
our
motions
with
the
most
restless
attention
and
now
that
it
was
over
he
came
and
licked
my
hands
and
laid
himself
down
at
my
feet
the
least
motion
however
so
much
as
a
rustling
among
the
leaves
startled
him
he
rose
looked
round
and
seemed
to
enquire
into
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
but
he
abstained
from
barking
and
every
kind
of
noise
whether
it
were
that
he
was
conscious
of
the
advantage
of
quiet
to
a
person
in
his
master
s
condition
or
that
he
had
the
sense
to
know
in
the
situation
in
which
we
were
placed
that
whatever
produced
alarm
might
eventually
expose
us
to
undiscovered
danger
it
was
broad
daylight
before
hector
and
several
other
persons
in
his
company
hector
was
not
of
a
temper
to
have
receded
from
any
thing
he
undertook
and
the
authority
of
marguerite
had
in
this
instance
seconded
his
remonstrances
with
the
surly
and
inactive
peasants
of
the
place
i
had
at
this
time
only
one
other
male
servant
but
when
hector
returned
he
brought
with
him
a
crazy
kind
of
litter
and
a
recruit
of
four
mountaineers
the
wounded
man
still
lived
and
was
conveyed
alive
to
the
place
at
which
i
had
taken
up
my
lodging
he
survived
three
days
and
during
the
whole
of
that
period
the
dog
could
neither
be
moved
by
force
nor
prevailed
on
by
entreaties
to
quit
the
apartment
of
his
master
before
his
death
my
unfortunate
guest
recovered
the
power
of
speech
he
told
me
that
his
name
was
andrea
filosanto
and
which
struck
me
as
somewhat
extraordinary
that
he
was
of
pisa
the
very
place
at
which
i
purposed
to
take
up
my
abode
he
had
a
brother
resident
in
that
city
and
had
himself
been
about
to
marry
a
very
beautiful
and
accomplished
young
lady
an
heiress
of
the
house
of
carracciuoli
in
pisa
previously
to
his
marriage
he
resolved
to
make
a
visit
to
his
mother
who
had
espoused
to
her
second
husband
a
french
nobleman
of
languedoc
he
had
travelled
accompanied
only
by
one
servant
contrary
to
the
persuasions
both
of
his
brother
and
the
family
of
his
intended
bride
but
that
servant
though
he
had
been
a
very
short
time
in
his
employment
was
active
ingenious
and
obliging
and
had
established
himself
strongly
in
the
favour
of
his
master
signor
filosanto
had
taken
with
him
a
sum
of
money
the
produce
of
one
year
s
income
of
the
dower
of
his
mother
and
it
was
but
too
probable
that
the
richness
of
the
charge
he
bore
had
been
fatal
to
the
life
of
the
bearer
his
servant
had
disappeared
from
his
side
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
his
being
attacked
by
the
banditti
and
various
concurring
circumstances
seemed
to
fix
on
this
servant
the
accusation
of
being
an
accomplice
with
the
murderers
having
heard
from
the
unfortunate
sufferer
the
tale
of
treachery
of
his
human
attendant
i
related
to
him
the
extraordinary
example
of
fidelity
and
attachment
shown
by
his
dog
the
master
was
struck
with
the
story
i
told
and
called
the
dog
to
him
upon
his
bed
the
poor
animal
first
leaped
up
upon
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
then
warily
and
with
great
caution
crawled
to
his
master
s
face
filosanto
embraced
the
dog
who
by
his
manner
showed
himself
fully
sensible
of
the
purport
of
the
action
that
very
evening
having
requested
me
to
convey
his
remains
to
the
tomb
of
his
ancestors
at
pisa
the
master
expired
the
dog
in
dumb
and
constant
grief
watched
by
the
corpse
and
followed
the
vehicle
in
which
it
was
conveyed
to
pisa
after
the
funeral
he
made
the
choice
from
which
he
could
not
be
diverted
of
living
with
me
and
not
with
the
brother
and
relations
of
his
master
to
whom
he
was
almost
wholly
a
stranger
but
who
would
gladly
have
received
him
one
of
the
advantages
i
derived
from
this
adventure
was
the
friendship
and
protection
of
the
filosanti
and
carracciuoli
two
of
the
most
powerful
families
in
pisa
i
have
not
yet
finished
the
history
of
my
dog
a
few
months
after
our
establishment
in
the
pisan
territory
the
valet
of
the
deceased
had
the
audacity
to
appear
in
that
city
he
believed
himself
to
be
entirely
unknown
there
his
master
having
taken
him
into
his
service
during
his
residence
as
a
student
in
the
university
of
bologna
and
having
ordered
him
previously
to
his
projected
tour
into
france
to
stay
behind
and
settle
his
debts
and
other
affairs
at
that
place
he
found
however
an
adversary
in
pisa
that
in
all
his
anticipations
had
never
occurred
to
his
thoughts
the
dog
saw
him
at
a
distance
in
the
street
ran
towards
him
with
incredible
swiftness
and
fell
upon
him
with
savage
violence
and
ferocity
the
man
was
not
extricated
from
his
grip
till
he
had
been
severely
and
dangerously
wounded
thus
assailed
all
the
terrors
of
superstition
and
an
accusing
conscience
seized
on
this
devoted
villain
he
owned
who
he
was
and
confessed
that
he
had
made
one
among
the
assassins
and
plunderers
of
his
master
visible
probably
to
the
dog
though
unseen
by
the
unfortunate
filosanto
he
declared
that
he
knew
not
what
motive
had
brought
him
to
pisa
that
he
seemed
to
himself
under
the
guidance
of
an
impulse
which
he
had
not
power
to
resist
and
that
he
rejoiced
that
providence
had
thus
conducted
him
to
the
expiation
of
his
guilt
he
was
brought
to
his
trial
and
suffered
death
for
his
crime
charon
such
was
the
name
by
which
my
dog
was
distinguished
showed
himself
in
all
his
actions
worthy
of
the
character
for
attachment
and
sagacity
which
he
had
in
these
instances
acquired
he
was
therefore
the
favourite
of
my
whole
family
and
particularly
of
hector
but
his
own
partiality
was
with
the
nicest
discrimination
reserved
for
me
the
ruling
passion
of
his
preceding
master
had
been
the
sports
of
the
field
and
his
leading
singularity
an
uncommon
familiarity
and
friendship
towards
his
brute
attendants
by
this
conduct
he
had
won
the
affections
and
perhaps
awakened
the
understanding
and
virtues
of
the
faithful
charon
i
own
my
weakness
i
could
not
resist
the
assiduities
and
regard
of
this
generous
brute
and
though
i
had
never
before
conceived
any
extraordinary
partiality
for
creatures
of
his
species
his
sagacity
and
nobleness
of
nature
took
a
strong
hold
of
my
affection
i
admired
his
form
and
agility
as
he
bounded
and
gamboled
before
me
upon
the
plain
in
the
midst
of
his
gayest
frolics
he
was
all
attention
and
the
least
sign
i
made
him
would
instantly
divert
his
exertions
to
a
different
pursuit
he
was
accustomed
to
salute
me
with
honest
undesigning
homage
every
morning
as
i
came
from
my
chamber
and
i
should
have
missed
his
presence
with
heaviness
of
heart
upon
this
plain
and
homely
occasion
he
was
the
associate
of
my
solitary
walks
and
my
companion
when
pensive
meditations
induced
me
to
withdraw
from
all
human
society
i
became
accustomed
at
such
periods
to
observe
him
by
my
side
and
should
have
felt
that
all
was
not
right
if
he
were
not
there
i
was
interested
in
his
health
his
and
his
enjoyments
and
if
any
calamity
befell
him
was
prepared
to
feel
it
more
severely
than
a
wise
man
is
sometimes
willing
to
it
would
scarcely
be
necessary
to
add
to
this
simple
history
of
my
faithful
charon
the
circumstance
of
his
having
saved
the
life
of
a
beautiful
little
boy
of
ten
years
old
who
had
unluckily
slipped
into
the
arno
and
whom
he
seized
by
his
garments
and
drew
to
the
shore
had
it
not
some
connection
with
what
i
shall
speedily
have
occasion
to
relate
chapter
xxiv
to
return
to
the
thread
of
my
narrative
which
in
stating
these
particulars
i
have
in
some
points
i
sat
down
as
i
have
already
said
in
the
environs
of
the
city
of
pisa
marguerite
as
well
as
myself
had
a
powerful
attachment
to
the
retirement
of
rural
life
and
i
judged
it
equally
eligible
for
the
health
and
intellectual
improvement
of
my
daughters
i
accordingly
purchased
a
small
domain
delightfully
situated
but
of
simple
appearance
on
the
banks
of
the
arno
here
i
proposed
to
remain
during
the
indisposition
of
my
wife
which
i
flattered
myself
retirement
tranquillity
attention
and
kindness
would
in
no
long
time
be
able
to
cure
to
this
object
i
resolved
to
devote
my
exertions
well
did
she
merit
this
return
from
me
who
had
restored
me
in
the
guilty
ruin
of
my
fortunes
and
raised
me
from
the
abyss
of
insanity
odious
and
detestable
in
the
utmost
degree
should
i
have
appeared
in
my
own
eyes
if
i
could
have
neglected
any
means
i
was
able
to
devise
to
heal
a
mischief
of
which
my
own
precipitation
selfishness
and
folly
were
the
only
causes
every
little
continual
nameless
care
i
exerted
was
as
a
drop
of
healing
balm
to
the
burning
fever
and
remorse
of
my
conscience
nothing
indeed
could
eradicate
my
distemper
i
felt
the
worm
of
perpetrated
guilt
gnawing
at
my
heart
but
my
solicitudes
for
marguerite
at
least
during
the
moments
they
were
in
action
mitigated
my
anguish
and
this
transitory
relief
however
insignificant
it
may
appear
in
the
eyes
of
others
i
cherished
beyond
the
wealth
of
kingdoms
marguerite
and
myself
appeared
at
this
time
to
have
changed
characters
she
was
languid
indisposed
in
body
and
mind
her
thoughts
gloomy
her
hopes
blasted
her
wishes
bankrupt
still
however
she
maintained
her
superiority
to
what
i
had
been
in
a
similar
condition
she
endeavoured
to
make
the
best
of
what
yet
remained
to
her
though
she
declined
the
vain
attempt
of
forgetting
what
she
had
lost
she
hung
over
her
daughters
with
inexpressible
endearment
she
consoled
them
she
reasoned
with
them
she
endeavoured
to
steel
their
minds
for
whatever
ill
might
be
yet
in
store
she
cultivated
their
understandings
she
breathed
into
them
mingled
sentiments
of
resignation
and
energy
there
was
in
her
conversation
with
them
a
striking
tone
of
celestial
and
divine
her
eloquence
was
copious
her
manner
rich
unaffected
and
flowing
her
speech
simple
free
from
exaggeration
and
turbulence
but
mild
affectionate
and
winning
it
sank
deep
into
the
hearts
of
her
hearers
and
seemed
to
give
a
new
turn
to
their
tempers
and
disposition
it
rendered
the
character
of
julia
at
once
more
distinctive
and
yet
more
chastised
it
inspired
an
unwonted
mildness
and
sensibility
to
that
of
louisa
and
rendered
the
cadette
of
the
family
unusually
grave
thoughtful
and
sedate
but
upon
me
were
devolved
the
more
active
occupations
of
our
establishment
marguerite
had
formerly
been
i
was
now
the
steward
every
kind
of
superintendence
from
which
the
distinction
of
sex
did
not
unavoidably
exclude
me
was
resigned
to
me
by
the
lovely
victim
of
my
indiscretions
marguerite
had
been
my
nurse
i
was
now
ambitious
to
be
hers
i
made
myself
the
schoolmaster
of
my
children
marguerite
confined
her
communications
to
general
topics
and
the
culture
of
the
heart
i
initiated
them
in
music
drawing
geography
several
different
languages
of
europe
and
in
every
accomplishment
that
i
believed
would
be
really
ornamental
or
improving
to
them
i
might
it
is
true
have
hired
different
masters
to
instruct
them
in
each
of
these
branches
and
it
is
not
impossible
that
they
might
then
have
been
better
taught
though
i
was
myself
no
incompetent
preceptor
but
i
had
an
honest
artifice
for
my
guide
in
the
plan
i
adopted
i
was
desirous
of
removing
out
of
the
sight
of
my
wife
every
thing
that
might
remind
her
of
the
fatal
legacy
the
effects
of
which
she
was
induced
so
bitterly
to
deplore
in
some
particulars
i
may
affirm
of
myself
that
i
was
now
a
better
and
a
kinder
husband
than
i
had
been
in
the
days
of
our
gayest
prosperity
or
the
scene
of
our
infant
loves
i
studied
with
assiduity
the
temper
of
marguerite
i
watched
her
looks
i
endeavoured
to
anticipate
her
every
wish
i
meditated
with
care
the
plan
of
life
which
her
simple
and
feeling
heart
if
solely
consulted
would
have
led
her
originally
to
have
chosen
and
i
copied
out
in
the
whole
arrangement
of
our
household
the
idea
painted
in
my
mind
far
from
us
were
now
the
ostentation
and
pomp
of
the
on
the
banks
of
the
garonne
we
lived
now
not
to
awaken
admiration
and
envy
in
the
bosom
of
guests
and
spectators
we
lived
for
ourselves
every
thing
was
elegant
every
thing
was
tasteful
but
not
an
article
found
its
place
in
our
residence
that
did
not
rest
its
claim
to
be
there
upon
a
plea
of
usefulness
though
by
the
nature
of
my
situation
i
was
superior
to
all
restraint
from
a
consideration
of
expense
yet
our
competent
board
and
orderly
habitation
approached
nearer
in
their
appearance
to
the
honest
plainness
of
a
rustic
than
to
the
sumptuousness
of
hereditary
nobility
a
table
set
out
with
striking
propriety
and
neatness
was
preferred
to
the
richness
of
plate
and
the
splendour
of
porcelain
and
lustres
i
was
anxious
that
marguerite
should
forget
the
change
of
our
situation
and
the
extent
of
my
resources
the
objects
of
my
present
pursuit
were
obscurity
and
content
that
marguerite
might
forget
my
acquisition
i
was
studious
to
appear
to
have
forgotten
it
myself
if
a
stranger
had
entered
our
habitation
and
surveyed
our
economy
he
would
have
judged
that
our
revenues
amounted
to
a
decent
competence
and
that
we
disbursed
them
with
a
judicious
discretion
nothing
was
to
be
seen
that
would
have
betrayed
the
possessor
of
the
powder
of
projection
we
had
no
guests
we
cultivated
no
acquaintance
we
were
formed
to
suffice
to
each
other
within
our
little
circle
and
but
for
the
importunate
recurrence
of
disquieting
reflections
we
should
have
done
so
to
look
at
the
exterior
of
our
household
it
might
have
been
thought
that
we
had
arrived
at
that
sweet
forgetfulness
of
anxious
care
that
delicious
leisure
and
unbroken
retreat
which
have
in
all
ages
been
the
theme
of
panegyric
to
poets
and
philosophers
but
it
was
not
so
our
reciprocal
relations
were
changed
and
the
hope
of
the
house
of
leon
was
no
longer
in
the
midst
of
us
to
cheer
to
enlighten
and
to
warm
our
bosoms
a
life
of
leisure
is
often
an
active
and
a
busy
life
the
grand
i
might
almost
say
the
single
object
of
present
attention
to
me
was
the
restoration
of
the
health
and
tranquillity
of
marguerite
for
that
i
watched
with
unwearied
assiduity
subordinate
to
this
occupation
were
the
different
arts
and
accomplishments
in
which
i
instructed
my
daughters
yet
neither
the
former
nor
the
latter
of
these
engagements
filled
up
all
the
time
of
a
mind
so
restless
and
rapid
as
mine
was
intervals
occurred
in
which
my
attentions
to
marguerite
would
have
been
not
soothing
but
troublesome
and
in
which
i
could
no
longer
impart
a
lesson
to
my
daughters
without
relaxing
and
weakening
the
spring
of
progression
in
their
minds
these
intervals
i
sometimes
dedicated
to
chemistry
and
the
operations
of
natural
magic
the
more
effectually
to
hide
these
pursuits
from
the
eye
of
marguerite
i
occupied
unknown
to
her
a
sort
of
grotto
buried
almost
from
human
observation
in
a
hollow
on
the
banks
of
the
river
and
which
was
connected
by
a
winding
path
and
a
concealed
subterranean
passage
with
the
garden
of
my
own
habitation
the
secrets
of
the
stranger
had
given
me
a
particular
relish
for
this
kind
of
pursuit
there
are
habits
of
the
mind
and
modes
of
occupying
the
attention
in
which
when
once
we
have
engaged
there
seems
a
sort
of
physical
impossibility
of
ever
withdrawing
ourselves
this
was
my
case
in
the
present
instance
my
habit
was
of
no
long
standing
but
no
reading
of
my
story
no
mere
power
of
language
and
words
can
enable
a
bystander
to
imagine
how
deep
it
was
sunk
into
my
heart
how
inextricably
it
was
twisted
with
all
the
fibres
of
my
bosom
that
he
may
in
some
degree
enter
into
my
situation
i
entreat
the
reader
to
consider
what
are
the
most
imperious
passions
of
the
human
mind
they
have
rudely
been
described
to
be
wealth
power
and
pleasurable
sensation
how
alluring
to
every
one
of
us
are
the
visionary
conceptions
of
the
mind
respecting
these
most
potent
excitements
but
mine
were
no
visions
i
had
grasped
them
in
my
hand
and
known
their
reality
i
had
felt
that
the
wealth
of
the
whole
world
was
at
my
disposal
and
that
i
held
my
life
by
a
tenure
independent
and
imperial
these
are
not
of
the
class
of
conceptions
that
fade
and
perish
from
the
mind
we
can
not
wake
from
them
as
from
a
dream
and
forget
that
ever
such
things
were
they
had
changed
the
whole
constitution
of
my
nature
it
would
have
required
a
miracle
greater
than
all
the
consecrated
legends
of
our
church
record
to
have
restored
me
to
what
i
formerly
was
if
then
i
could
have
resolved
never
henceforth
to
use
the
gifts
i
had
received
i
yet
firmly
believe
that
i
never
could
have
refrained
from
the
composition
and
decomposition
of
simples
and
from
experiments
on
the
nature
of
substances
chemical
and
metallic
i
was
however
far
from
having
formed
any
such
resolution
as
that
i
have
named
my
present
forbearance
to
bring
forth
the
secret
treasure
of
my
powers
was
purely
an
accommodation
to
the
unhappy
condition
of
my
wife
and
i
felt
it
as
a
meritorious
exertion
thus
to
postpone
the
use
of
the
faculties
i
possessed
in
the
mean
time
the
amusement
i
sought
that
i
regarded
as
properly
and
entirely
my
own
consisted
in
these
experiments
while
i
was
busied
with
my
crucible
i
was
able
more
vividly
to
present
to
myself
my
seeming
superiority
to
the
rest
of
my
species
i
used
the
employments
of
my
grotto
as
a
sort
of
from
which
to
set
forth
in
a
series
of
intoxicating
reveries
not
to
mention
that
to
improve
in
the
facility
of
my
secret
operations
might
become
a
valuable
subsidiary
to
the
pursuits
of
my
future
life
i
took
occasionally
as
my
companion
at
these
periods
the
negro
of
the
prison
of
constance
i
found
him
sufficiently
adapted
for
my
purpose
his
innocence
and
implicit
obedience
to
whomever
he
served
rendering
me
secure
that
he
would
anticipate
nothing
that
he
would
conjecture
nothing
that
he
would
rest
in
what
he
saw
that
i
might
almost
exhibit
my
whole
process
under
his
eye
without
once
awakening
the
busy
fiend
of
curiosity
in
a
mind
to
which
science
had
never
unveiled
her
charms
he
was
formed
to
be
a
pure
passive
machine
in
the
hands
of
his
employer
only
with
this
singular
difference
from
the
lifeless
machine
of
the
engineer
or
mechanical
inventor
that
he
was
susceptible
of
attachment
and
affection
as
well
as
of
a
certain
species
of
contentment
and
a
certain
species
of
goodness
and
virtue
a
feature
of
my
individual
character
which
has
already
frequently
presented
itself
to
the
attention
of
the
reader
is
the
love
of
admiration
and
spontaneous
deference
i
am
at
this
moment
ashamed
of
my
vices
and
my
follies
but
it
must
be
recollected
in
the
first
place
that
they
are
human
and
in
the
second
that
i
am
writing
not
their
vindication
but
their
history
in
the
midst
of
my
experiments
and
chemical
lucubrations
i
could
not
help
sometimes
ostentatiously
exhibiting
to
hector
the
wonders
of
my
art
and
those
extraordinary
effects
which
have
in
all
ages
drawn
upon
the
more
eminent
operators
of
natural
magic
the
reproach
of
being
necromancers
and
conjurers
this
i
did
partly
perhaps
that
my
attendant
might
learn
to
look
up
to
me
with
a
kind
of
nameless
respect
and
awe
but
partly
also
that
i
might
divert
myself
with
the
simplicity
of
his
nature
and
the
gaping
and
motionless
astonishment
with
which
he
viewed
my
performances
if
i
had
not
done
this
or
digressed
into
idle
and
ostentatious
experiments
he
would
otherwise
have
seen
enough
in
the
operations
in
which
his
assistance
if
not
absolutely
necessary
was
extremely
convenient
to
have
induced
a
person
so
void
of
the
meanest
european
information
to
regard
me
as
assisted
by
and
in
league
with
invisible
powers
the
prejudice
against
me
with
which
this
poor
fellow
had
been
impressed
at
the
commencement
of
our
intercourse
did
not
long
hold
out
in
his
ingenuous
mind
against
the
more
favourable
sentiments
which
my
present
situation
and
mode
of
living
were
calculated
to
inspire
the
specimens
he
had
hitherto
seen
of
european
society
were
of
the
most
unfavourable
kind
his
first
master
was
a
wretch
of
brutal
disposition
ferocious
and
insolent
disdaining
to
reason
himself
and
impatient
of
remonstrance
in
others
this
man
had
exercised
the
temper
of
his
humble
and
honest
attendant
with
every
variety
of
savage
caprice
and
having
tired
the
restlessness
of
his
own
gloomy
tyranny
without
being
able
to
exhaust
the
modest
and
unexampled
patience
of
his
servant
had
finished
by
throwing
him
into
gaol
upon
a
wanton
and
groundless
charge
of
dishonesty
this
which
was
intended
as
a
further
exercise
of
tyranny
deserved
to
be
hailed
by
the
poor
sufferer
as
a
period
of
jubilee
and
deliverance
his
innocence
as
i
have
already
related
was
speedily
recognised
by
his
new
who
accordingly
exerted
himself
to
obtain
justice
for
the
friendless
victim
and
from
a
reputed
thief
proposed
to
elevate
him
to
the
rank
of
a
turnkey
hector
had
neither
kindred
nor
patron
to
assist
him
the
outcast
of
a
gaol
he
must
again
have
entered
the
world
with
a
blasted
character
thus
circumstanced
and
influenced
beside
by
gratitude
to
the
liberality
of
his
deliverer
he
willingly
accepted
the
situation
proposed
to
him
with
his
new
master
who
not
less
unprincipled
was
less
tyrannical
than
his
predecessor
the
humbleness
of
his
hopes
taught
him
to
be
contented
yet
in
the
bosom
of
the
gaoler
all
his
fidelity
and
regard
could
not
enable
him
to
detect
one
positive
virtue
and
within
the
walls
of
the
prison
there
had
existed
nothing
that
could
by
any
possibility
cherish
and
refresh
the
human
heart
the
scene
presented
to
hector
s
observation
in
our
little
retreat
on
the
banks
of
the
arno
was
of
a
very
different
nature
to
his
frank
and
affectionate
spirit
it
appeared
a
perfect
paradise
he
had
yet
scarcely
been
acquainted
with
any
but
the
refuse
of
mankind
from
the
infection
of
whose
vices
his
unapprehensive
and
invincible
simplicity
had
been
his
only
safeguard
and
he
was
now
suddenly
introduced
to
the
presence
and
intercourse
of
the
most
perfect
of
her
sex
he
loved
her
as
a
benefactor
and
he
worshipped
her
as
a
god
there
is
no
receipt
for
begetting
affection
in
others
so
infallible
as
a
warm
and
susceptible
heart
hector
accordingly
soon
became
in
a
remarkable
degree
the
favourite
of
my
daughters
his
temper
was
naturally
cheerful
and
gay
and
warmed
by
their
encouragement
it
became
a
thousand
times
more
so
when
he
had
completed
the
occupations
of
the
day
the
lightness
of
his
spirit
would
prompt
him
to
sing
and
dance
for
ever
he
exhibited
the
whole
circle
of
his
sportive
games
for
their
amusement
the
infantine
innocence
of
his
understanding
remarkably
adapted
him
to
be
the
butt
of
their
little
waggeries
and
mischiefs
whatever
tricks
were
played
upon
him
were
however
tempered
by
the
forbearance
and
regard
his
worth
demanded
while
the
obstreperous
cheerfulness
with
which
he
would
second
their
mirth
when
most
ignorant
of
its
occasion
gave
uncommon
zest
to
the
amusement
and
furnished
eternal
provocation
to
the
prolonging
and
varying
its
features
let
not
the
fastidious
reader
complain
of
the
inconsistency
of
this
part
of
my
picture
or
censure
the
levity
of
my
daughters
i
am
not
writing
a
tragedy
but
a
history
sad
grief
and
melancholy
can
not
and
ought
not
for
ever
to
reign
in
the
human
face
or
the
human
heart
no
daughters
ever
loved
a
mother
more
entirely
more
fervently
than
marguerite
was
loved
by
her
children
they
were
unwearied
in
their
attention
to
her
often
was
their
pillow
watered
with
tears
occasioned
by
the
sad
presentiment
of
the
loss
they
were
destined
to
sustain
but
the
human
mind
particularly
in
the
season
of
youth
has
an
unconquerable
principle
of
elasticity
in
its
frame
the
bow
can
not
be
kept
for
ever
on
the
stretch
and
when
the
whole
soul
appears
to
be
bent
down
by
calamity
to
the
grave
it
will
often
surprisingly
recover
its
vigour
and
renew
its
strength
the
ingenuous
nature
of
these
poor
girls
led
them
indeed
occasionally
to
reproach
themselves
with
these
moments
of
cheerfulness
as
with
a
crime
but
it
was
no
crime
none
but
the
uncharitably
rigorous
and
morose
will
charge
it
upon
them
as
a
crime
it
interfered
with
no
duty
it
diminished
no
affection
it
had
no
tendency
to
harden
their
hearts
it
was
a
tax
they
paid
to
the
imperfectness
of
our
nature
it
was
a
tribute
of
gratitude
to
that
god
who
while
he
deals
out
to
us
the
most
terrible
calamities
fails
not
to
mix
with
the
copious
draught
some
solitary
drops
of
beneficence
julia
alone
whose
temper
was
constitutionally
serious
and
soft
entered
little
into
these
sports
of
which
her
youngest
sister
was
the
eternal
leader
and
untired
partaker
yet
even
upon
the
grave
countenance
of
julia
they
would
sometimes
provoke
an
unwilling
smile
which
upon
her
countenance
sat
with
uncommon
lustre
the
hilarity
and
loveliness
which
hector
found
in
the
midst
of
my
family
instigated
and
increased
the
attachment
he
began
to
feel
for
myself
he
could
not
believe
that
the
father
of
such
daughters
and
the
chosen
husband
of
such
a
consort
could
be
destitute
of
a
title
to
be
loved
he
reasoned
in
his
own
way
upon
the
attempt
i
had
made
to
corrupt
his
fidelity
an
attack
which
he
never
thoroughly
digested
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
his
attendance
upon
my
chemical
processes
and
the
wonders
i
occasionally
showed
to
excite
his
astonishment
did
not
tend
to
elevate
me
in
his
good
opinion
but
he
could
not
avoid
witnessing
in
me
many
of
the
virtues
of
a
good
husband
and
a
good
father
and
these
so
new
to
his
observation
strongly
impressed
him
in
my
favour
the
regularity
of
my
habits
and
the
mildness
of
my
carriage
were
also
calculated
to
win
his
affection
and
esteem
never
had
the
poor
fellow
s
affections
been
so
forcibly
called
out
as
they
were
in
his
new
situation
and
he
would
cheerfully
have
stretched
out
his
neck
to
the
assassin
s
knife
to
have
warded
off
impending
evil
from
the
meanest
of
us
prosperity
and
ease
have
often
been
found
the
parents
of
wishes
and
inclinations
unfelt
before
adversity
is
the
season
of
sober
thought
calls
home
the
erratic
mind
and
teaches
us
to
be
cheaply
satisfied
but
the
man
who
has
many
gratifications
is
apt
to
wander
in
imagination
from
daily
and
familiar
joys
and
confidently
to
reach
after
things
yet
untried
such
was
the
situation
of
hector
hector
was
in
love
our
sweet
and
simple
mansion
was
distant
scarcely
more
than
two
hundred
yards
from
a
characteristic
italian
village
the
maid
of
a
little
in
this
place
had
caught
his
inexperienced
heart
he
had
been
invited
by
some
peasants
to
a
moonlight
festivity
on
the
lawn
of
the
and
though
i
should
have
been
better
pleased
that
my
servants
should
decline
this
sort
of
amusement
i
could
not
have
the
heart
to
deny
him
it
was
so
far
as
i
knew
the
first
and
the
last
time
that
hector
had
ever
resorted
to
it
but
i
was
deceived
hector
had
proved
the
gayest
and
most
amusing
of
the
whole
circle
his
cheerfulness
was
inexhaustible
and
his
mirth
in
the
utmost
degree
harmless
and
good
humoured
he
had
played
a
thousand
antics
and
danced
with
an
agility
that
knew
no
end
in
a
word
the
accomplishments
of
hector
in
spite
of
the
jetty
hue
that
stained
his
face
had
won
the
heart
or
roused
the
coquetry
of
the
plump
and
rosy
the
overtures
she
made
and
the
lures
she
threw
out
were
too
glaring
to
escape
the
notice
even
of
the
modest
hector
he
felt
himself
flattered
such
is
human
nature
at
suddenly
becoming
an
object
of
admiration
and
preference
to
a
woman
whom
his
imagination
stimulated
by
her
visible
partiality
attired
in
a
hundred
charms
he
owned
himself
hers
in
all
fair
and
honest
fealty
to
the
world
s
end
love
taught
hector
a
lesson
which
he
had
never
learned
before
in
nature
he
was
frank
and
as
far
as
fidelity
to
his
master
permitted
it
wore
his
heart
as
naked
as
his
face
love
taught
him
dissimulation
a
vulgar
footman
or
clown
is
as
forward
as
the
most
empty
beau
in
boasting
of
the
triumphs
he
has
gained
over
the
female
heart
and
in
sacrificing
the
reputation
of
those
who
have
loved
him
at
the
shrine
of
his
vanity
not
such
was
hector
he
shut
up
his
new
sensations
and
reveries
as
a
sacred
deposit
in
his
bosom
nature
worked
within
him
and
he
would
have
been
ashamed
to
speak
and
distressed
to
hear
of
emotions
now
felt
till
now
never
experienced
his
artless
and
ingenuous
temper
in
this
one
particular
assumed
the
guise
of
cunning
never
did
he
tell
his
love
in
the
ear
of
any
indifferent
auditor
assiduously
did
he
avoid
pronouncing
even
the
name
of
her
to
whom
he
was
attached
in
any
other
case
he
would
have
announced
to
me
his
inclinations
and
previously
demanded
my
leave
of
absence
for
his
excursions
but
love
seemed
to
him
imperiously
to
command
privacy
and
he
employed
every
imaginable
precaution
to
prevent
me
and
all
human
beings
from
knowing
whither
he
went
or
that
he
was
absent
at
all
in
one
of
his
visits
to
his
fair
he
happened
incautiously
to
drop
some
very
remote
hint
of
the
scenes
in
which
he
had
just
been
engaged
with
me
in
my
secret
grotto
the
curiosity
of
the
girl
was
strongly
roused
she
questioned
him
further
he
started
and
was
terrified
to
recollect
what
he
had
said
i
had
strictly
enjoined
him
secrecy
towards
every
member
of
my
family
my
precaution
had
extended
no
further
for
as
i
have
said
i
scarcely
knew
that
he
had
the
most
casual
intercourse
with
any
person
beyond
my
own
roof
but
hector
naturally
dreaded
that
what
i
was
so
earnest
to
conceal
from
every
one
in
my
house
he
would
be
highly
to
blame
to
communicate
to
a
stranger
he
therefore
peremptorily
refused
and
with
many
signs
of
distress
to
say
another
word
on
the
subject
the
piqued
at
his
resistance
had
recourse
to
female
arts
she
was
cruel
she
uttered
words
of
sharp
displeasure
and
disdain
she
knew
that
a
person
who
refused
her
such
a
trifle
could
not
have
an
atom
of
regard
for
her
she
commanded
him
never
to
see
her
more
unsuccessful
in
these
expedients
she
had
recourse
to
expedients
of
a
different
sort
she
wept
she
called
him
base
and
unkind
she
saw
he
was
determined
to
be
the
death
of
her
she
was
seized
with
strong
fits
of
sobbing
and
hysterical
affection
in
the
midst
of
all
this
he
was
as
unmoved
as
a
rock
of
marble
he
interpreted
every
thing
that
passed
in
its
most
literal
form
he
felt
more
severely
her
unkindness
and
sympathised
more
truly
in
her
distress
than
perhaps
any
human
creature
would
have
done
but
no
further
could
she
gain
upon
him
the
confidence
of
his
master
was
in
question
and
he
would
sooner
have
died
upon
the
rack
than
run
the
slightest
risk
of
betraying
it
from
these
arts
she
descended
to
arts
more
congenial
to
the
habits
of
her
life
she
summoned
all
her
skill
to
perplex
him
with
cunning
and
insidious
questions
from
her
questions
he
ought
to
have
fled
but
of
this
hector
was
incapable
he
was
distressed
by
her
severity
he
grieved
for
the
unintentional
pain
he
had
caused
her
all
these
circumstances
melted
his
heart
and
he
could
not
resolve
upon
any
thing
that
was
not
considerate
and
respectful
towards
her
as
the
framing
of
artful
questions
was
the
of
the
and
she
might
have
challenged
in
this
article
the
most
hoary
practitioner
of
the
quibbling
bar
so
it
was
exactly
the
weakest
side
upon
which
poor
hector
could
be
attacked
his
simplicity
yielded
him
up
a
defenceless
prey
to
the
assailant
least
of
all
human
undertakings
was
he
capable
of
detecting
the
various
faces
of
a
doubtful
question
and
of
guarding
himself
against
the
traps
of
an
insidious
foe
it
was
not
till
the
fourth
interview
from
hector
s
original
hint
that
the
had
recourse
to
this
species
of
attack
and
she
did
not
withdraw
her
forces
till
she
had
extorted
from
him
all
he
knew
when
hector
found
that
all
his
guards
were
baffled
and
put
to
flight
he
had
then
recourse
to
the
only
expedient
that
remained
conjuring
her
by
every
thing
sacred
and
every
thing
tremendous
not
to
betray
a
trust
she
had
so
ungenerously
obtained
from
him
she
readily
promised
every
thing
he
desired
soothed
by
her
compliance
he
determined
not
to
mention
to
me
the
lapse
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
it
would
in
his
opinion
have
been
little
less
than
treason
to
suspect
his
dulcinea
of
indiscretion
or
frailty
in
the
breast
of
this
miracle
of
nature
was
not
his
loyalty
as
secure
as
it
could
be
even
in
his
own
why
then
should
he
betray
the
secret
of
his
love
which
had
never
yet
been
confided
even
to
the
senseless
air
why
should
he
subject
himself
to
the
inconceivable
anguish
and
confusion
of
owning
where
my
interests
or
where
my
wishes
were
concerned
that
he
had
been
found
tripping
and
imperfect
why
should
he
inflict
a
pain
or
cause
in
me
a
fear
which
he
knew
and
he
only
could
know
was
groundless
thus
it
happened
that
i
had
one
more
confident
of
what
i
purposed
should
be
secret
than
i
was
myself
in
the
smallest
degree
advertised
of
the
consequences
of
this
indiscretion
of
my
servant
were
not
slow
in
rendering
themselves
visible
the
was
by
no
means
so
scrupulous
or
delicate
in
her
sentiments
as
my
humble
but
faithful
attendant
as
she
had
given
her
company
to
hector
she
had
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
in
him
such
integrity
and
goodness
of
heart
as
could
not
fail
to
extort
the
esteem
of
any
human
being
she
really
honoured
him
she
was
unwilling
to
give
him
any
cause
of
uneasiness
but
she
had
another
lover
perhaps
she
had
more
the
laws
of
chastity
she
regarded
as
prejudices
and
believed
they
were
never
formed
for
persons
in
her
situation
in
society
she
was
of
opinion
that
the
more
lovers
she
had
provided
she
satisfied
them
all
the
more
completely
did
she
improve
the
talents
with
which
heaven
had
endowed
her
few
women
have
any
secrets
for
the
man
they
admit
to
their
embraces
in
an
hour
of
amorous
dalliance
she
communicated
to
agostino
the
ostler
all
that
she
knew
of
the
conjurations
and
spells
of
monsieur
boismorand
such
was
the
name
i
had
assumed
upon
my
entrance
into
italy
her
communication
was
probably
attended
with
cautions
imitated
from
those
with
which
hector
had
so
industriously
loaded
the
in
the
preceding
example
perhaps
the
had
another
mistress
with
whom
he
thought
it
would
be
unjust
to
practise
greater
reserves
than
the
had
done
with
him
be
that
as
it
will
the
rumours
which
were
whispered
to
my
prejudice
speedily
got
air
and
it
may
be
were
repeated
with
the
greater
avidity
on
account
of
the
mystery
that
attended
them
and
the
injunctions
of
secrecy
with
which
they
were
accompanied
chapter
xxv
italy
may
be
considered
as
the
very
focus
and
parent
of
superstitious
credulity
the
materials
which
hector
had
furnished
after
all
the
interrogations
of
the
donzella
were
slight
compared
with
the
superstructure
which
was
presently
erected
on
them
my
grotto
was
said
to
be
the
appropriated
haunt
where
a
thousand
devils
held
their
infernal
sabbath
the
terrified
imagination
of
the
rustics
listening
with
a
temper
horribly
distracted
between
curiosity
and
alarm
created
to
itself
fictitious
howlings
and
shrieks
and
saw
pale
and
sulphureous
flames
dancing
upon
the
surface
of
the
stream
poor
hector
was
early
the
victim
of
their
cruel
and
untamed
ignorance
they
believed
that
the
peculiarity
of
his
complexion
rendered
him
a
singularly
agreeable
intercessor
between
me
and
my
infernal
familiars
the
colour
of
charon
was
similar
to
that
of
my
confidential
attendant
and
he
like
hector
fell
under
the
calumnious
misconstructions
of
the
affrighted
villagers
conspicuously
noble
affectionate
and
useful
as
he
was
the
jaundiced
eye
of
superstition
metamorphosed
him
into
a
devil
the
storms
of
thunder
and
lightning
to
which
the
climate
in
which
i
resided
is
particularly
subject
acquired
new
terror
from
the
ill
fame
which
now
pursued
the
name
of
monsieur
boismorand
at
those
times
the
shapeless
form
of
monsters
vomiting
smoke
and
flames
were
visible
to
the
neighbourhood
sometimes
scudding
along
the
blue
tops
of
the
distant
hills
and
at
others
with
audaciousness
incredible
brushing
even
at
the
elbow
of
the
almost
lifeless
clowns
and
and
then
suddenly
dissolving
into
air
their
place
no
longer
marked
but
by
the
noisome
and
deadly
stench
they
left
behind
all
the
misfortunes
of
the
district
were
imputed
to
me
the
mortality
of
cattle
the
convulsions
and
death
of
children
and
the
pale
and
lingering
decay
of
persons
recently
advanced
to
an
age
of
puberty
innocent
and
blameless
was
my
conduct
to
all
around
us
often
was
i
forward
and
eager
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
and
afflicted
never
was
i
the
author
of
the
slightest
inconvenience
or
prejudice
to
any
yet
nothing
merely
human
could
be
hated
in
the
degree
in
which
i
was
hated
few
were
daring
and
intrepid
enough
to
repeat
the
very
name
i
bore
and
when
it
was
inadvertently
pronounced
it
produced
through
the
whole
extent
of
the
astonished
circle
an
involuntary
and
supernatural
shudder
agostino
the
first
lover
who
had
made
an
impression
on
the
heart
of
hector
s
donzella
was
as
i
afterwards
found
a
fellow
of
a
gloomy
and
ferocious
disposition
a
true
italian
determined
that
none
should
perpetrate
an
affront
against
him
with
impunity
but
should
expiate
in
some
refined
and
cruel
vengeance
the
levity
by
which
they
had
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
give
birth
to
his
hatred
he
by
no
means
relished
or
approved
the
liberal
and
sentiments
of
the
donzella
often
had
they
inflicted
on
him
the
darkest
torments
of
jealousy
nor
had
he
failed
at
least
in
one
preceding
instance
to
make
his
rival
the
victim
of
his
resentment
the
donzella
however
went
on
in
her
career
she
was
light
of
heart
gay
in
temper
and
careless
of
consequences
she
had
always
hitherto
succeeded
by
playful
blandishments
or
more
serious
demonstrations
of
contrition
in
mollifying
the
temper
of
her
brute
and
every
pardon
she
received
operated
with
her
as
a
new
permission
to
offend
she
did
not
sufficiently
consider
that
she
was
thus
continually
raising
to
a
higher
pitch
the
frenzy
of
his
malice
hector
in
the
mean
time
was
utterly
unconscious
and
ignorant
of
the
perilous
situation
in
which
he
stood
while
to
the
apprehension
of
agostino
the
giving
him
a
negro
for
a
rival
whom
his
pride
regarded
as
belonging
to
an
inferior
species
of
beings
and
his
devout
ignorance
likened
to
the
leader
of
the
infernal
squadrons
was
the
last
and
most
intolerable
insult
his
malice
was
ingenious
and
subtle
he
disdained
the
vulgar
revenge
of
stabbing
his
antagonist
in
the
dark
and
supposing
that
his
enmity
could
be
gorged
by
a
blow
when
the
venom
of
his
nature
was
thoroughly
put
in
motion
nothing
could
restore
it
to
quietness
and
tranquillity
but
some
mighty
stroke
to
excite
the
wonder
of
every
bystander
and
that
should
leave
behind
it
a
track
of
desolation
never
to
be
filled
up
again
and
erased
he
heard
therefore
with
unsated
appetite
and
eager
joy
the
tale
of
necromancy
and
infernal
machination
repeated
to
him
from
hector
by
the
donzella
the
impression
which
the
narrative
produced
upon
him
was
a
mixed
sentiment
of
transport
at
the
apprehension
of
such
an
instrument
of
vengeance
and
of
palpitating
hatred
superstition
teaching
him
to
believe
and
to
view
with
abhorrence
that
which
he
desired
to
render
tenfold
more
an
object
of
faith
and
aversion
to
his
neighbours
he
struck
an
auspicious
and
august
alliance
between
his
revenge
and
his
religion
his
religion
exciting
him
to
exterminate
that
the
destruction
of
which
would
produce
inexpressible
gratification
to
his
revenge
the
darkness
of
his
spirit
led
him
to
proceed
with
double
caution
and
vigilance
in
his
correspondence
with
the
donzella
he
discovered
nothing
to
her
of
the
dark
project
which
was
engendering
in
his
mind
and
only
betrayed
so
much
of
his
superstitious
feelings
and
fears
as
by
giving
new
emotion
might
stimulate
her
to
gratify
his
curiosity
and
her
own
by
a
detection
of
further
particulars
he
was
assiduous
in
the
underhand
and
sinister
propagation
of
the
tale
to
which
he
did
not
fail
to
give
his
own
colouring
and
affix
his
own
feelings
he
was
desirous
that
the
train
should
be
laid
in
silence
and
that
the
explosion
he
designed
should
be
free
from
all
of
the
event
thus
an
individual
of
whose
animosity
i
had
no
apprehension
and
the
meanness
of
whose
appearance
would
probably
have
made
me
neglect
all
precaution
against
him
gave
method
and
direction
to
an
evil
of
which
however
upon
a
review
i
am
not
inclined
to
doubt
i
should
have
been
the
victim
if
the
enmity
and
industry
of
this
individual
had
been
wholly
withdrawn
the
mischief
was
long
in
preparation
before
i
received
in
any
way
the
slightest
intimation
of
the
predicament
in
which
i
stood
the
first
circumstance
at
all
calculated
to
excite
alarm
in
my
mind
was
the
singular
manner
in
which
i
found
myself
regarded
if
i
entered
any
of
the
neighbouring
villages
or
met
the
rustics
and
their
dames
as
i
strayed
along
the
roads
or
the
fields
they
fled
my
approach
deserted
the
streets
and
carefully
shut
themselves
up
in
their
houses
till
i
had
passed
where
it
was
impossible
to
avoid
me
they
bowed
themselves
to
the
earth
in
the
most
submissive
guise
before
me
while
the
most
lively
terror
was
painted
in
their
countenances
dreading
lest
they
should
excite
the
resentment
of
a
tremendous
and
inexorable
foe
these
tokens
however
were
far
from
inspiring
me
with
a
conception
of
the
truth
they
perplexed
they
astonished
they
distressed
me
sore
as
i
was
with
my
recent
afflictions
my
mind
was
but
too
fully
prepared
for
anticipations
of
evil
i
had
suffered
from
suspicions
i
had
suffered
from
calumnious
imputations
i
had
suffered
from
the
malignant
effects
of
popular
rumour
had
i
yielded
my
confidence
to
any
person
but
such
a
one
as
hector
it
is
probable
my
suspicions
would
have
turned
on
that
side
but
my
reliance
on
him
was
not
less
than
that
which
alexander
the
great
yielded
to
philip
the
physician
i
knew
his
rectitude
his
simplicity
his
fidelity
and
the
singleness
of
his
heart
and
i
could
not
harbour
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
respecting
him
my
reliance
was
of
that
entire
and
perfect
sort
which
did
not
express
itself
by
a
recollection
of
the
physical
possibility
and
an
acquittal
founded
in
deliberation
but
by
a
total
vacancy
of
doubt
or
of
retrospect
that
way
directed
just
such
as
the
state
of
my
mind
would
have
appeared
if
the
thing
had
been
naturally
impossible
i
was
not
however
ignorant
and
raw
enough
to
be
deceived
by
the
exterior
of
homage
i
have
described
i
sufficiently
knew
that
what
i
beheld
was
the
offspring
of
hatred
to
feel
one
s
self
hated
is
in
all
instances
a
painful
and
humiliating
state
of
the
human
mind
to
me
it
was
especially
so
i
was
not
formed
to
retaliate
this
species
of
injury
i
could
not
hate
in
my
turn
i
was
formed
to
love
i
could
not
look
upon
my
species
with
dark
and
gloomy
contemplations
i
was
prompt
to
admire
their
virtues
and
perhaps
even
too
prompt
to
extenuate
their
errors
it
may
i
believe
be
laid
down
as
a
rule
that
they
who
can
not
hate
can
least
endure
to
be
made
objects
of
hatred
fettered
however
as
i
now
was
by
the
tenderest
consideration
for
the
health
and
tranquillity
of
marguerite
i
thought
it
best
to
temporise
and
submit
in
silence
my
principal
anxiety
was
to
hide
these
symptoms
from
the
notice
of
my
family
this
i
could
not
completely
effect
some
of
them
were
too
glaring
and
obtrusive
entirely
to
escape
the
observation
of
my
daughters
in
their
walks
but
the
filial
forbearance
they
felt
towards
their
mother
led
them
implicitly
and
without
any
concerted
plan
to
concur
with
me
in
my
exertions
for
her
quiet
the
animosity
of
agostino
was
restless
and
inextinguishable
his
plans
did
not
terminate
in
exciting
against
me
a
secret
and
covered
abhorrence
they
aimed
at
nothing
less
than
my
utter
destruction
the
next
exertion
of
the
conspiracy
which
was
engendering
against
me
was
of
a
tragical
nature
it
happened
one
night
after
all
my
family
was
retired
to
rest
and
i
was
myself
sunk
into
a
slumber
that
i
was
suddenly
alarmed
at
the
report
of
a
musket
which
seemed
to
be
fired
almost
under
the
window
of
my
chamber
this
was
a
very
singular
circumstance
and
calculated
to
convey
an
impression
of
danger
i
leaped
from
my
bed
and
ran
to
the
window
the
night
was
extremely
dark
and
every
thing
seemed
perfectly
quiet
presently
i
discerned
a
glimmering
light
like
that
of
a
lantern
which
however
appeared
to
be
gradually
retiring
to
a
greater
distance
i
was
not
thus
satisfied
but
determined
to
hasten
down
stairs
and
investigate
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
marguerite
who
had
heard
the
firing
of
the
musket
as
well
as
myself
now
called
me
to
her
and
entreated
me
not
to
expose
myself
to
unnecessary
danger
in
compliance
with
her
remonstrances
i
promised
though
unwillingly
not
to
go
out
into
the
court
or
upon
the
lawn
but
to
content
myself
with
examining
the
state
of
every
part
of
the
house
when
i
came
to
the
staircase
and
the
hall
i
found
that
the
alarm
had
communicated
to
almost
every
person
in
the
family
who
presently
assembled
round
me
we
patroled
the
house
but
found
every
thing
in
the
situation
in
which
it
had
been
left
and
nowhere
any
appearance
of
violence
i
opened
several
of
the
windows
but
all
was
darkness
and
silence
having
thus
far
satisfied
myself
i
listened
with
a
degree
of
amusement
to
the
conjectures
and
sage
remarks
of
several
of
the
servants
a
rank
of
society
who
may
usually
be
found
to
derive
a
degree
of
enjoyment
from
incidents
of
this
sort
which
for
the
moment
strikingly
tend
to
level
all
artificial
distinctions
and
confer
on
every
one
the
liberty
of
uttering
his
reflections
without
apprehension
or
constraint
i
did
not
however
feel
myself
entirely
easy
the
circumstance
which
had
just
occurred
combined
with
the
forebodings
which
had
lately
impressed
me
had
filled
me
with
undefinable
terror
and
alarm
hector
would
willingly
have
gone
over
the
grounds
contiguous
to
the
house
to
see
if
he
could
discover
any
thing
that
related
to
or
could
explain
the
incident
but
i
had
promised
marguerite
that
i
would
search
no
further
and
the
temper
of
my
mind
would
not
suffer
me
to
expose
another
to
a
danger
which
i
abstained
from
encountering
in
my
own
person
it
was
more
than
an
hour
before
the
conclave
in
which
we
were
assembled
broke
up
and
every
one
retired
fatigued
with
attention
and
prepared
to
fall
into
the
soundest
sleep
my
dreams
were
uneasy
and
disturbed
my
mind
was
in
a
tumult
of
imaginary
calamities
and
i
passed
the
greater
part
of
the
night
in
a
state
of
singular
anxiety
in
the
morning
i
was
scarcely
sunk
into
a
refreshing
slumber
before
i
was
suddenly
roused
from
sleep
by
a
repetition
of
shrieks
of
astonishment
and
distress
i
put
on
my
clothes
as
quickly
as
i
could
and
hastened
towards
the
spot
from
which
the
sounds
appeared
to
proceed
the
first
object
i
beheld
was
the
little
boy
of
ten
years
old
whom
charon
had
a
short
time
before
dragged
out
of
the
river
stretched
along
upon
the
lifeless
body
of
this
faithful
and
generous
animal
the
musket
the
report
of
which
had
alarmed
us
the
night
before
had
no
doubt
been
aimed
against
charon
and
the
greater
part
of
its
contents
appeared
to
be
lodged
in
his
body
as
no
further
sound
had
succeeded
the
firing
he
had
probably
been
killed
on
the
spot
he
was
at
a
small
distance
from
the
house
near
a
private
footpath
where
he
had
been
found
in
the
morning
by
the
lad
whose
life
he
had
recently
preserved
the
poor
boy
had
not
at
first
understood
what
had
happened
to
his
benefactor
but
only
thought
him
asleep
and
prompted
by
affection
for
the
generous
creature
had
quietly
sat
down
by
him
till
he
should
awake
he
had
not
sat
long
however
before
he
discerned
about
him
the
marks
of
blood
he
put
his
hand
to
the
wound
the
animal
stirred
not
he
passed
to
his
head
he
saw
his
eyes
fiery
and
starting
and
his
lips
distorted
he
endeavoured
to
awake
him
as
one
would
awake
a
human
being
to
whom
some
mischief
had
happened
of
which
he
was
not
aware
all
his
efforts
were
fruitless
he
found
his
body
motionless
and
his
joints
stiff
in
death
the
apprehension
of
what
had
occurred
then
suddenly
flashed
on
his
mind
he
burst
out
into
shrieks
of
astonishment
and
anguish
hector
was
the
first
person
who
caught
the
sound
and
hastened
to
the
spot
i
immediately
followed
the
poor
negro
who
in
the
innocence
of
his
heart
was
uninitiated
in
the
proud
distinctions
by
which
civilised
man
is
taught
to
place
so
vast
a
barrier
between
the
human
nature
and
the
brute
was
struck
speechless
with
sorrow
and
amazement
he
recognised
the
dead
being
before
him
for
his
he
recollected
in
him
his
friend
his
companion
his
intimate
acquaintance
between
whom
and
himself
there
had
for
some
time
passed
an
uninterrupted
reciprocation
of
acts
of
kindness
and
assistance
a
morose
and
fastidious
reader
perhaps
will
ask
me
why
i
lay
so
great
a
stress
upon
so
petty
and
insignificant
an
incident
as
the
death
of
a
dog
it
might
have
been
little
to
other
persons
it
was
not
little
to
us
let
the
reader
recollect
his
ingenuity
in
procuring
aid
for
his
dying
master
his
gratitude
to
the
person
by
whom
that
aid
was
afforded
and
his
unconquerable
antipathy
to
his
master
s
murderer
these
are
not
common
traits
there
are
many
men
whose
premature
fate
has
been
the
most
unrelentingly
avenged
that
in
moral
and
useful
qualities
could
not
have
stood
the
comparison
with
my
generous
charon
it
surely
was
no
common
cause
for
regret
that
a
creature
who
had
distinguished
himself
by
a
conduct
so
peculiarly
admirable
should
have
encountered
so
premature
and
unmerited
a
fate
his
conduct
the
reader
may
in
some
degree
comprehend
and
appreciate
but
i
should
in
vain
attempt
to
delineate
those
admirable
qualities
in
this
faithful
domestic
which
do
not
fall
within
the
province
of
narrative
and
which
to
have
justly
appreciated
you
must
have
been
personally
and
familiarly
acquainted
with
him
beside
ours
was
a
family
of
love
as
we
were
affectionately
attached
to
each
other
so
we
never
admitted
a
servant
under
our
roof
who
did
not
prove
himself
by
his
conduct
utterly
unworthy
to
whom
we
did
not
extend
a
share
of
that
friendship
and
affection
which
seemed
to
be
the
right
of
every
one
that
dwelt
in
our
family
feeling
does
not
stay
to
calculate
with
weights
and
a
balance
the
importance
and
magnitude
of
every
object
that
excites
it
it
flows
impetuously
from
the
heart
without
consulting
the
cooler
responses
of
the
understanding
there
was
another
circumstance
which
rendered
the
catastrophe
of
this
generous
animal
of
great
moment
to
us
it
was
a
clear
proof
that
there
was
somewhere
a
strong
animosity
at
work
against
his
master
it
was
impossible
he
could
himself
have
provoked
his
fate
never
was
a
creature
more
gentle
and
inoffensive
though
his
bulk
was
great
and
his
strength
uncommon
the
energies
he
possessed
were
always
employed
in
acts
of
justice
and
beneficence
never
in
acts
of
aggression
but
if
a
hatred
were
at
work
so
busy
and
fierce
as
to
prompt
an
action
like
this
how
were
we
to
estimate
it
what
was
its
source
and
whither
did
it
tend
these
were
very
interesting
and
serious
considerations
we
however
dwelt
for
some
time
longer
in
the
centre
of
general
antipathy
and
abhorrence
without
being
able
in
the
smallest
degree
to
explain
to
ourselves
what
we
saw
as
we
knew
not
in
what
we
had
offended
we
were
unable
to
atone
for
our
fault
or
even
to
guard
ourselves
against
the
repetition
of
it
nor
were
we
by
any
means
prepared
to
comprehend
the
extent
of
our
danger
happily
marguerite
whose
health
was
now
in
a
rapid
decline
was
least
exposed
to
the
observation
of
this
new
mischief
though
she
felt
enough
of
it
to
confirm
her
in
the
sentiment
that
she
had
nothing
fortunate
and
happy
to
look
forward
to
in
the
small
remainder
of
her
existence
there
was
indeed
one
idea
perpetually
present
to
her
which
rendered
the
impression
of
ordinary
occurrences
extremely
feeble
upon
her
mind

unknowing
and

this
melancholy

followed

chapter
xxvi
it
was
no
long
time
after
the
death
of
charon
that
hector
came
home
one
evening
in
a
state
of
the
most
violent
anxiety
and
trepidation
he
burst
upon
me
in
my
study
where
i
was
sitting
alone
buried
in
one
of
those
deep
reveries
which
especially
since
the
legacy
of
the
stranger
had
been
among
the
most
frequent
habits
of
my
mind
his
perturbation
was
such
as
to
render
it
impossible
for
him
to
impose
on
himself
the
smallest
degree
of
caution
and
restraint
the
noise
he
made
in
entering
the
apartment
startled
me
i
looked
up
and
perceived
his
features
swelled
his
face
bruised
and
his
garments
disfigured
with
blood
for
heaven
s
sake
hector
exclaimed
i
what
is
the
matter
he
answered
not
he
advanced
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
room
he
took
down
a
pistol
one
of
those
which
i
always
kept
loaded
in
my
apartment
he
came
towards
me
he
fell
upon
his
knees
he
tendered
the
pistol
to
my
acceptance
hector
cried
i
what
am
i
to
understand
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
kill
me
dear
master
for
christ
s
sake
i
entreat
you
to
kill
me
i
took
the
pistol
from
his
hand
it
pointed
towards
the
floor
and
will
you
not
kill
me
in
a
mournful
accent
exclaimed
he
what
have
you
done
that
deserves
that
i
should
kill
you
kill
me
only
kill
me
pray
kill
me
he
spread
out
his
hands
towards
me
with
a
gesture
of
intreaty
hector
what
means
this
agitation
what
has
happened
you
terrify
me
beyond
must
i
speak
replied
he
must
i
be
the
accuser
of
my
guilty
self
he
burst
into
an
agony
of
tears
would
i
were
dead
would
i
had
been
torn
into
a
thousand
pieces
before
this
had
happened
indeed
sir
i
am
innocent
i
thought
no
harm
indeed
it
is
not
my
fault
what
have
you
done
whence
come
these
bruises
and
this
wound
it
is
all
my
fault
it
is
all
my
doing
nobody
else
why
will
you
not
kill
me
hector
i
can
not
bear
this
uncertainty
recollect
yourself
be
pacified
and
tell
your
story
will
you
forgive
me
forgive
you
what
what
have
you
done
to
deserve
my
anger
no
no
i
do
not
wish
to
be
forgiven
i
only
wish
you
to
abhor
to
detest
to
curse
and
to
kill
me
this
is
beyond
all
i
never
loved
any
body
but
you
and
my
mistress
and
my
dear
young
ladies
i
never
did
any
body
else
the
least
atom
of
mischief
and
now
my
folly
will
be
the
ruin
of
you
all
pardon
me
sir
i
will
torment
you
no
longer
i
will
get
the
better
of
myself
and
tell
you
all
that
has
he
then
informed
me
though
with
many
breaks
and
passionate
interruptions
of
what
he
had
just
discovered
my
evil
repute
as
a
necromancer
the
many
strange
and
terrible
stories
that
were
circulated
of
me
the
antipathy
universally
entertained
against
me
the
active
ferociousness
with
which
this
antipathy
was
accompanied
and
the
consequences
that
he
feared
would
result
he
ascribed
the
whole
to
his
own
imprudence
and
to
the
particulars
which
the
superior
cunning
of
the
donzella
in
spite
of
his
invincible
refusal
to
acquaint
her
with
a
single
circumstance
had
wrung
from
him
hector
had
collected
several
of
these
particulars
accidentally
from
a
neighbouring
rustic
and
had
been
vehement
in
my
defence
while
they
were
eager
in
debate
others
had
joined
them
but
hector
had
found
them
all
opponents
not
one
a
supporter
irritated
with
the
contest
and
the
opprobrious
language
heaped
upon
himself
and
his
master
hector
had
been
provoked
to
strike
the
most
insolent
of
the
disputants
immediately
several
had
fallen
upon
him
at
once
and
it
was
owing
to
the
uncommon
strength
and
dexterity
he
possessed
that
he
had
escaped
alive
out
of
their
hands
beside
innumerable
blows
with
fist
foot
and
stick
he
had
received
two
or
three
stabs
in
different
parts
of
the
body
from
the
knives
with
which
the
italian
is
too
much
accustomed
to
assail
his
adversary
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
gallant
and
generous
defence
of
hector
had
considerably
augmented
the
danger
of
my
situation
they
dismissed
him
with
a
thousand
execrations
against
both
him
and
myself
and
vows
that
they
would
signalise
their
vengeance
by
setting
fire
to
my
house
having
related
his
story
hector
concluded
with
again
earnestly
conjuring
me
to
kill
him
that
so
he
might
expiate
the
imprudence
and
folly
by
which
he
had
made
himself
the
author
of
my
calamity
the
excessiveness
of
the
poor
fellow
s
distress
excited
me
to
employ
every
effort
to
pacify
his
mind
hector
said
i
you
have
been
very
imprudent
but
i
foresee
no
such
consequences
as
your
terrified
imagination
has
led
you
to
forebode
the
idle
threats
of
clowns
in
the
midst
of
their
brawls
are
entitled
to
little
regard
i
am
not
so
weak
and
infirm
of
soul
as
to
be
moved
from
my
tranquillity
by
their
senseless
prate
i
entertain
no
doubt
of
your
fidelity
and
affection
i
am
not
angry
with
you
the
fault
you
have
been
guilty
of
arose
from
no
defect
of
vigilance
or
attachment
you
did
what
you
could
and
where
you
failed
it
was
only
in
that
to
which
your
powers
were
not
commensurate
you
have
done
well
and
wisely
now
in
acquainting
me
with
particulars
and
the
whole
extent
of
the
danger
doubt
not
but
i
will
employ
such
precautions
and
be
so
awake
to
my
situation
as
to
forestall
the
possibility
of
thus
i
endeavoured
to
assuage
honest
hector
s
perturbation
but
with
no
adequate
effect
he
hung
his
head
in
sorrow
and
refused
to
be
comforted
shame
and
terror
assailed
him
together
and
he
knew
not
how
to
support
their
united
pressure
he
intreated
me
not
to
lull
myself
in
fancied
security
and
fall
blindfold
on
my
ruin
he
entreated
me
not
to
forgive
him
my
clemency
and
forbearance
served
only
to
make
him
regard
with
greater
horror
the
crime
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
if
however
i
refused
to
punish
him
and
by
penance
or
death
to
lighten
the
remorse
that
hung
upon
his
heart
he
would
at
least
devote
himself
in
opposition
to
the
evil
he
had
created
and
die
rather
than
it
should
touch
a
hair
of
our
heads
this
idea
he
seemed
to
view
with
some
complacency
but
the
pleasure
it
gave
was
a
glimmering
and
momentary
light
he
could
not
remain
in
any
place
for
an
instant
he
wrung
his
hands
with
anguish
and
exhibited
every
feature
of
the
deepest
despair
i
examined
his
bruises
and
wounds
the
latter
of
which
though
attended
with
a
copious
effusion
of
blood
did
not
appear
to
be
dangerous
i
warned
him
to
be
guilty
of
no
further
indiscretion
to
betray
nothing
of
what
had
happened
to
any
one
of
my
family
and
to
engage
in
no
further
controversies
and
broils
in
my
vindication
though
i
endeavoured
to
make
light
of
what
i
heard
in
compassion
to
the
distress
of
my
servant
yet
when
i
came
to
reconsider
the
subject
in
solitude
it
by
no
means
appeared
to
me
in
a
light
and
trivial
point
of
view
one
part
of
hector
s
story
had
related
to
the
death
of
charon
who
i
now
found
had
owed
his
fate
to
the
superstition
of
my
uncultivated
neighbours
i
had
always
entertained
a
formidable
idea
of
the
character
of
an
italian
populace
whom
i
regarded
as
more
suspicious
sanguinary
and
violent
than
any
other
race
of
men
in
the
world
i
deplored
my
fate
that
exposed
me
to
their
rage
i
deplored
my
folly
that
had
admitted
any
confidant
into
my
individual
pursuits
though
my
confidence
had
been
so
limited
and
its
receiver
so
trustworthy
that
i
could
not
have
imagined
any
evil
would
have
resulted
i
determined
that
i
would
not
expose
myself
to
the
risk
of
such
sinister
consequences
as
in
my
opinion
might
in
my
present
situation
easily
overtake
me
i
grieved
for
the
tender
health
and
the
doubtful
state
of
mind
of
my
beloved
marguerite
which
alone
opposed
themselves
to
the
adoption
of
an
immediate
change
of
scene
in
the
state
of
her
health
i
had
been
grievously
disappointed
i
had
looked
for
amendment
i
found
decay
the
decay
however
was
gradual
almost
imperceptible
from
time
to
time
i
had
even
flattered
myself
that
the
progress
was
in
an
opposite
direction
but
the
delusion
was
soon
banished
another
difficulty
arose
in
addition
to
the
rest
marguerite
appeared
pregnant
a
circumstance
that
now
first
presented
itself
after
a
cessation
of
ten
years
the
morning
after
the
accident
and
disclosure
of
hector
i
went
to
pisa
determined
to
consult
with
the
marchese
filosanto
elder
brother
of
the
unfortunate
andrea
who
was
probably
more
accurately
acquainted
with
the
italian
character
than
myself
and
understood
the
shades
of
that
character
as
they
were
modified
in
the
particular
territory
in
which
i
resided
the
marchese
was
a
man
universally
admired
for
subtlety
of
reasoning
vigorousness
of
comprehension
and
refinement
of
taste
in
the
structure
of
his
mind
he
was
scarcely
an
italian
he
had
resided
several
years
in
england
and
was
the
intimate
friend
of
henry
howard
earl
of
surrey
who
some
time
after
fell
a
victim
to
the
jealous
tyranny
of
his
native
sovereign
king
henry
the
eighth
the
marchese
was
frank
generous
and
disinterested
and
possessed
more
fully
the
affections
of
every
one
within
the
circle
of
his
friendship
than
any
other
man
i
ever
knew
he
was
of
a
sanguine
temper
always
contemplating
the
world
on
its
brightest
side
and
from
the
generosity
of
his
own
heart
incapable
of
crediting
a
distant
danger
or
of
discerning
the
storm
in
the
embryo
cloud
where
it
was
silently
engendering
in
the
conference
we
held
i
was
influenced
too
implicitly
by
my
consciousness
of
his
integrity
and
the
gigantic
powers
of
his
mind
and
did
not
sufficiently
advert
to
those
peculiarities
in
his
temper
which
i
have
now
described
the
external
facts
with
which
the
narrative
of
hector
had
furnished
me
i
fully
detailed
to
him
as
to
my
particular
pursuits
i
contented
myself
with
stating
that
i
indulged
freely
in
the
study
of
chemistry
and
was
of
those
persons
ordinarily
accounted
visionaries
who
amused
themselves
with
the
expectation
of
finding
the
philosopher
s
stone
having
heard
my
story
to
an
end
the
marchese
ridiculed
my
apprehensions
he
saw
nothing
in
the
facts
that
alarmed
me
but
a
cowardly
superstition
whose
utmost
flight
reached
no
higher
than
the
shooting
a
dog
and
a
squabble
between
a
boisterous
rustic
and
a
servant
too
acutely
sensitive
for
the
reputation
of
his
master
he
assured
me
that
the
days
of
such
superstition
as
i
contemplated
were
long
since
past
and
that
his
countrymen
less
deserved
the
imputation
than
any
others
as
living
at
the
very
centre
and
source
of
catholic
imposition
they
saw
deeper
into
the
mystery
and
were
not
exposed
to
the
advantage
which
distance
possesses
for
augmenting
our
reverence
he
expatiated
with
great
eloquence
on
the
vice
of
a
suspicious
temper
a
spirit
of
alarm
and
continual
apprehension
like
the
jealousy
of
lovers
he
said
made
the
meat
it
fed
on
it
brooded
over
plots
that
had
no
existence
but
in
the
wanderings
of
a
disturbed
imagination
it
was
continually
interrupting
the
quiet
of
its
owner
and
the
tranquillity
of
society
and
for
the
sake
of
avoiding
imaginary
evils
often
plunged
into
such
as
were
real
he
advised
me
to
go
home
and
be
contented
he
recommended
to
me
to
clear
up
the
clouds
of
my
mind
and
cultivate
a
light
heart
a
cheerful
temper
and
a
generous
confidence
in
the
honest
sympathies
of
mankind
in
fine
he
bade
me
continue
my
pursuits
avoid
éclat
and
trust
in
his
sagacity
that
no
ill
consequences
would
ensue
the
remonstrances
of
the
marchese
filosanto
led
me
to
suspect
that
i
had
been
idly
credulous
i
had
too
easily
participated
the
feelings
and
apprehensions
of
a
poor
uninstructed
negro
and
had
suffered
the
secret
griefs
that
brooded
in
my
heart
to
discolour
my
perceptions
and
aggravate
the
features
of
circumstances
in
themselves
trifling
or
indifferent
i
began
to
be
half
ashamed
of
the
gloominess
of
my
conceptions
i
could
not
alas
follow
the
advice
of
the
marchese
as
to
the
cheerfulness
of
my
heart
but
i
could
exert
myself
to
prevent
my
present
melancholy
from
disfiguring
to
me
every
thing
i
saw
the
influence
exercised
over
my
conceptions
by
persons
of
eminent
intellect
has
always
been
great
not
that
the
judgment
i
formed
of
the
powers
of
my
own
mind
was
peculiarly
humble
but
i
reasoned
thus
perhaps
the
person
i
consult
is
as
well
informed
in
the
subject
under
consideration
as
i
am
in
that
case
his
decision
is
as
fully
entitled
to
attention
as
my
own
and
thus
without
cowardly
on
my
part
the
general
balance
of
the
argument
was
materially
altered
perhaps
without
being
on
the
whole
my
superior
he
may
be
more
competent
to
this
particular
question
in
either
case
my
idea
of
its
merits
became
perceptibly
modified
i
never
listened
to
the
sentiments
of
a
man
of
talents
when
they
differed
from
my
own
unless
where
he
was
evidently
visionary
and
irrational
without
being
shaken
as
to
the
credit
due
to
my
own
view
of
the
subject
such
then
was
the
effect
produced
on
me
by
the
marchese
s
expostulation
i
shook
off
my
apprehensions
and
laughed
at
my
fears
i
was
ashamed
of
the
want
of
gallantry
that
had
possessed
me
when
i
meditated
flight
from
so
trivial
a
menace
i
concluded
that
dangers
particularly
such
as
arise
from
the
irrational
passions
of
a
capricious
multitude
were
increased
when
symptoms
of
apprehension
discovered
themselves
and
abated
when
received
with
neglect
or
repelled
with
a
magnanimous
serenity
chapter
xxvii
meanwhile
the
unrelenting
agostino
was
fixed
in
his
purpose
and
incessant
in
his
machinations
he
believed
that
the
destructive
mine
was
now
sufficiently
prepared
and
that
he
might
proceed
in
all
surety
to
the
ultimate
explosion
he
apprehended
that
he
had
advanced
too
far
to
retract
that
the
death
of
charon
and
the
assault
upon
hector
were
calculated
sufficiently
to
announce
what
was
to
follow
and
that
it
would
be
injudicious
and
idle
to
grant
me
much
respite
for
reflection
the
passions
of
his
associates
were
wrought
up
to
a
frenzy
of
horror
and
needed
only
a
bold
and
artful
director
to
urge
them
to
any
point
of
fury
and
destruction
implicitly
as
i
had
confided
in
the
decision
of
the
marchese
i
had
speedily
reason
to
know
that
it
was
the
dictate
of
too
sanguine
and
presumptuous
a
spirit
on
my
return
from
his
palace
and
on
several
subsequent
occasions
i
found
the
manners
of
the
populace
altered
respecting
me
they
no
longer
viewed
me
with
a
sort
of
reverential
awe
or
fled
my
approach
they
insulted
me
with
their
eyes
they
muttered
curses
upon
me
in
a
voice
sufficiently
audible
to
be
understood
they
broke
forth
in
gestures
of
abhorrence
and
derision
they
regarded
me
with
looks
of
ferocious
hatred
and
when
i
had
passed
them
their
murmurs
gradually
swelled
into
shouts
of
triumphant
contumely
these
symptoms
however
were
progressive
each
day
became
more
odious
and
intolerable
than
the
last
they
who
have
never
been
placed
in
a
situation
like
mine
will
never
be
able
to
do
justice
to
my
grievance
they
will
perhaps
say
that
the
calamity
i
now
endured
was
a
trifling
one
and
that
a
weak
mind
only
can
be
elevated
by
the
acclamations
and
huzzas
of
the
multitude
or
depressed
by
their
hisses
and
scorn
i
did
not
and
i
could
not
feel
it
so
there
is
no
pleasure
more
congenial
to
the
human
heart
than
the
approbation
and
affection
of
our
fellows
i
call
heaven
to
witness
that
i
could
mount
the
scaffold
surrounded
with
an
innumerable
multitude
to
applaud
my
fortitude
and
to
feel
as
it
were
on
their
own
neck
the
blow
that
ended
me
and
count
it
a
festival
but
i
can
not
bear
to
be
surrounded
with
tokens
of
abhorrence
and
scorn
i
can
not
bear
to
look
round
me
through
an
extended
circle
and
see
the
impatience
of
despite
in
every
face
man
was
not
born
to
live
alone
he
is
linked
to
his
brethren
by
a
thousand
ties
and
when
those
ties
are
broken
he
ceases
from
all
genuine
existence
their
complacence
is
a
food
more
invigorating
than
ambrosia
their
aversion
is
a
torment
worse
than
that
of
the
damned
while
i
write
i
seem
again
to
hear
resounding
in
my
ears
the
hootings
and
clamours
of
these
infatuated
peasants
when
heard
indeed
they
went
to
my
heart
and
sat
there
colder
than
the
aspic
s
venom
they
rose
to
my
throat
with
a
sensation
bitterer
than
wormwood
they
unstrung
all
my
muscles
and
nerves
i
could
not
stay
i
could
not
fly
i
wished
myself
buried
deep
in
the
centre
of
the
earth
i
felt
something
worse
more
revolting
more
opposite
to
all
the
prejudices
and
propensities
of
the
soul
than
annihilation
i
have
known
in
various
situations
and
conditions
of
human
life
what
it
was
to
be
distressed
to
be
dejected
to
be
miserable
but
never
in
any
other
situation
have
i
felt
a
misery
so
concentrated
so
gnawing
and
insufferable
i
began
however
like
the
critics
i
am
figuring
to
myself
to
despise
the
pusillanimity
of
my
submission
and
to
believe
that
if
i
would
only
make
a
stand
and
turn
round
upon
my
enemy
i
should
subdue
him
this
resolution
i
could
with
difficulty
have
taken
in
the
moment
of
attack
it
was
formed
in
an
interval
of
retrospect
and
reflection
having
formed
it
the
contempt
i
should
have
felt
for
myself
would
have
been
too
exquisite
if
i
had
failed
to
put
it
in
execution
i
was
not
long
at
a
loss
for
an
opportunity
in
one
of
my
walks
i
found
myself
pursued
by
a
numerous
populace
with
a
peculiar
degree
of
inveteracy
i
yielded
for
some
time
till
i
came
to
a
place
that
appeared
convenient
for
the
purpose
of
haranguing
them
it
was
a
bench
placed
upon
a
rising
ground
and
sheltered
behind
by
a
thicket
which
had
been
erected
for
the
purpose
of
commanding
a
neighbouring
prospect
i
stopped
i
stepped
upon
the
bench
i
waved
my
hand
towards
the
multitude
they
perceived
my
purpose
with
some
degree
of
confusion
and
surprise
they
drew
nearer
do
not
listen
to
him
do
not
hear
a
word
he
has
to
say
cried
some
of
them
oh
hear
him
hear
him
exclaimed
others
i
obtained
an
audience
what
is
the
cause
said
i
of
all
this
hatred
and
persecution
because
you
are
a
wizard
a
necromancer
a
dealer
in
the
black
art
because
you
are
in
league
with
hell
and
have
sold
yourself
to
the
devil
answered
twenty
voices
at
once
hear
me
replied
i
and
i
will
convince
you
of
my
innocence
but
hear
me
in
silence
and
do
not
interrupt
for
myself
i
have
no
belief
in
the
existence
of
such
an
this
remark
produced
a
general
groan
why
should
i
have
sold
myself
to
the
foe
of
mankind
what
could
he
give
me
that
should
compensate
me
for
consigning
myself
over
to
him
for
ever
hereafter
the
power
of
exhibiting
strange
and
extraordinary
tricks
what
a
pitiful
recompence
but
if
i
had
bought
this
power
at
so
dear
a
price
should
i
hide
it
should
i
not
take
every
opportunity
of
exciting
your
reverence
and
astonishment
who
has
seen
me
perform
any
wonderful
feat
i
live
quietly
among
you
and
give
no
cause
of
offence
to
any
i
live
retired
in
the
midst
of
my
family
i
form
no
party
or
connections
i
do
not
intrude
into
any
of
your
affairs
political
or
private
i
do
not
even
enter
into
conferences
with
any
of
you
unless
induced
by
the
apparent
occasion
of
doing
some
good
and
benevolent
action
quit
then
this
ungenerous
persecution
do
not
turn
the
fury
of
your
resentment
upon
a
harmless
stranger
you
are
italians
the
most
polished
and
ingenious
people
on
the
face

glorious

show
yourselves
worthy
of
the
honour
with
which
your
name
is
heard
in
every
corner
of
the
habitable
world
while
i
was
yet
speaking
a
large
clot
of
mud
reached
me
and
struck
me
on
the
face
and
the
upper
part
of
my
breast
i
calmly
endeavoured
to
free
myself
from
its
effects
with
my
handkerchief
and
looking
round
me
demanded
in
the
sacred
spirit
of
conscious
innocence
how
have
i
deserved
this
treatment
thus
far
i
had
been
heard
with
a
doubtful
sentiment
of
murmur
and
approbation
and
i
began
to
feel
that
i
was
rather
gaining
ground
upon
my
audience
but
this
new
insult
seemed
to
turn
the
tide
of
popular
impression
in
an
instant
villain
renegado
accursed
of
god
i
heard
from
every
side
did
not
you
bewitch
my
cow
did
not
you
enchant
my
child
have
not
you
killed
my
daughter
down
with
him
exterminate
him
do
not
suffer
him
to
live
i
continued
my
efforts
to
be
heard
it
was
a
critical
moment
a
last
experiment
upon
the
power
of
firmness
and
innocence
to
control
the
madness
of
infuriated
superstition
it
was
in
vain
i
was
deafened
with
the
noise
that
assailed
me
it
was
no
longer
shouts
and
clamours
of
disapprobation
it
was
the
roaring
of
tigers
and
the
shriek
of
cannibals
sticks
stones
and
every
kind
of
missile
weapon
that
offered
itself
fell
in
showers
around
me
it
seemed
a
sort
of
miracle
that
i
escaped
instant
destruction
i
eluded
their
pursuit
after
some
time
i
ventured
to
return
to
my
own
house
i
had
in
the
interval
terrified
myself
with
the
idea
that
having
missed
my
person
they
might
have
hurried
thither
and
executed
some
terrible
vengeance
on
my
helpless
family
i
found
them
however
in
safety
the
mob
had
for
this
time
contented
itself
to
disperse
without
further
mischief
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
i
hastened
to
pisa
and
related
what
had
just
occurred
to
my
friend
the
marchese
he
was
surprised
but
he
still
adhered
to
his
opinion
he
had
never
supposed
he
told
me
that
a
noisy
and
clamorous
mob
was
a
proper
subject
upon
which
to
make
experiment
of
the
energy
of
truth
and
he
laughed
at
my
attempt
to
reason
them
out
of
their
superstition
but
they
meant
nothing
by
all
that
had
passed
it
was
the
mere
foam
and
fury
of
a
moment
poured
out
with
vehemence
and
then
dissipated
in
air
a
certain
set
of
politicians
had
for
their
particular
ends
represented
a
mob
as
a
terrific
and
formidable
engine
alas
they
were
rather
to
be
pitied
than
condemned
there
was
no
malice
in
their
hearts
they
were
in
reality
a
mere
material
machine
led
on
without
reflection
and
when
they
had
committed
a
momentary
ravage
astonished
themselves
the
most
at
the
injury
they
had
perpetrated
they
were
as
light
and
variable
as
a
feather
driven
with
every
breath
and
nothing
could
argue
greater
obliquity
of
intellect
than
to
suppose
because
they
were
in
a
certain
temper
and
sentiment
that
they
would
be
found
in
a
similar
temper
and
sentiment
the
marchese
however
wished
he
said
to
relieve
me
from
the
apprehension
of
this
imaginary
danger
and
therefore
offered
me
the
whole
suite
of
his
servants
for
the
defence
of
my
house
he
added
that
among
his
friends
and
retainers
in
the
city
of
pisa
he
did
not
doubt
in
an
hour
s
time
to
be
able
to
raise
a
troop
of
four
hundred
men
and
whatever
power
of
that
sort
he
possessed
he
assured
me
was
wholly
at
my
service
i
was
not
convinced
by
the
marchese
s
arguments
but
i
declined
his
offer
i
could
not
bear
to
think
that
blood
should
be
spilled
and
the
lives
of
these
poor
ignorant
wretches
sacrificed
for
the
preservation
of
a
thing
so
worthless
in
my
eyes
as
the
local
property
i
possessed
i
therefore
told
the
marchese
that
i
might
perhaps
wait
yet
a
day
or
two
longer
before
i
formed
my
resolution
but
that
the
instant
i
saw
one
fresh
symptom
of
the
hostility
of
the
villagers
i
was
determined
to
take
my
family
with
me
and
remove
far
beyond
the
reach
both
of
their
terrors
and
their
hatred
i
staid
two
hours
with
the
marchese
and
then
set
out
to
my
own
house
the
way
i
took
was
by
a
private
road
open
only
to
the
neighbouring
gentry
but
of
which
my
servant
carried
the
key
it
led
along
the
higher
ground
and
commanded
a
view
of
the
common
highway
considerably
before
i
reached
my
own
habitation
i
was
struck
with
the
appearance
of
persons
passing
in
considerable
numbers
and
in
a
tumultuous
manner
along
the
public
road
some
of
them
were
armed
with
clubs
and
others
with
torches
their
march
however
led
not
towards
my
house
but
in
an
opposite
direction
i
mended
my
pace
terrified
with
a
sort
of
vague
apprehension
of
what
might
have
happened
though
i
did
not
disguise
to
myself
that
what
i
saw
was
not
precisely
that
which
i
might
have
expected
to
see
if
they
had
been
returned
from
demolishing
my
property
and
burning
my
house
when
i
arrived
i
found
indeed
that
no
mischief
had
been
actually
committed
but
that
i
was
indebted
for
the
preservation
of
my
house
and
perhaps
for
the
lives
of
my
wife
and
children
to
the
sagacity
and
presence
of
mind
of
bernardin
the
servant
of
my
early
years
my
residence
had
been
the
object
against
which
the
march
of
the
populace
had
been
directed
bernardin
perceiving
their
intentions
had
with
great
difficulty
prevailed
upon
hector
to
keep
out
of
sight
nothing
could
be
more
adverse
to
the
feelings
and
inclination
of
my
faithful
negro
but
bernardin
having
convinced
him
that
his
appearance
would
only
exasperate
the
rage
of
the
assailants
and
that
perhaps
every
thing
of
importance
to
his
master
s
service
and
happiness
depended
at
present
upon
his
concealment
hector
yielded
to
his
representations
this
accomplished
bernardin
next
assembled
the
gardener
and
one
or
two
labourers
in
my
employment
who
happened
to
be
at
hand
and
having
furnished
them
with
stationed
them
at
different
windows
in
the
front
of
the
house
with
these
preparations
when
the
mob
arrived
he
resolutely
told
them
that
he
would
fire
on
the
first
person
that
attempted
to
break
in
they
were
staggered
furious
as
they
appeared
the
moment
before
this
threat
held
them
in
awe
they
paraded
two
or
three
times
round
the
house
clattering
their
arms
and
pouring
out
vehement
execrations
and
then
withdrew
solemnly
promising
that
they
would
return
the
following
night
and
level
the
house
with
the
ground
i
no
longer
yielded
the
smallest
degree
of
credit
to
the
unsuspicious
and
confiding
philosophy
of
the
marchese
filosanto
i
sent
off
my
wife
and
children
before
daybreak
for
lucca
determined
to
take
shipping
at
the
first
convenient
port
and
pass
over
into
spain
i
was
little
solicitous
for
reasons
with
which
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
about
my
property
and
moveables
i
had
no
motive
to
induce
me
to
fetter
and
clog
my
retreat
at
this
hour
of
peril
and
terror
with
a
single
article
of
rarity
and
price
my
furniture
indeed
was
not
splendid
but
it
was
handsome
and
valuable
and
the
indifference
with
which
i
resigned
the
whole
to
the
mercy
of
chance
was
a
matter
of
some
surprise
to
the
persons
around
me
my
servants
offered
to
defend
my
possessions
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
but
i
peremptorily
forbade
it
i
would
not
even
consent
to
their
taking
away
certain
articles
by
way
of
appropriating
them
to
their
personal
use
i
believed
that
if
i
admitted
a
single
act
of
that
sort
i
should
find
it
no
easy
matter
to
set
limits
to
their
avidity
and
as
i
had
determined
to
take
none
of
my
present
servants
with
me
the
negro
and
bernardin
excepted
i
feared
that
the
apparent
possession
of
a
single
article
that
had
been
mine
might
hereafter
mark
its
proprietor
a
victim
to
the
senseless
rage
of
blindfold
superstition
i
could
easily
make
up
to
these
honest
and
faithful
dependants
the
injury
they
might
sustain
from
the
seeming
severity
of
this
order
i
determined
to
shut
up
my
house
with
all
its
present
contents
as
joshua
the
captain
of
the
jews
drew
a
line
of
separation
round
the
profane
possessions
of
achan
and
to
leave
the
villagers
if
so
it
seemed
good
to
them
to
make
of
the
whole
a
to
propitiate
the
wrath
of
their
avenging
divinity
the
directions
i
issued
being
unhesitating
and
peremptory
met
with
a
ready
submission
from
all
my
other
domestics
hector
only
the
mild
and
complying
hector
of
whom
obedience
had
hitherto
appeared
to
constitute
the
very
soul
met
my
commands
with
a
resolute
refusal
the
present
distressed
appearance
of
my
fortunes
seemed
to
have
worked
the
poor
fellow
s
mind
to
a
paroxysm
of
insanity
he
considered
himself
as
the
sole
author
of
my
calamity
he
reviled
himself
in
the
bitterest
terms
of
compunction
and
abhorrence
the
language
which
the
agony
of
his
soul
forced
from
his
lips
was
such
as
could
not
fail
to
impress
upon
my
other
servants
a
conviction
of
the
justice
of
the
imputations
that
were
now
brought
against
us
this
however
was
of
little
importance
i
must
at
all
events
have
been
contented
to
leave
behind
me
in
my
present
neighbourhood
a
name
loaded
with
the
execrations
of
religious
fanaticism
hector
imprecated
upon
himself
a
thousand
curses
if
so
long
as
he
continued
to
live
the
populace
should
lay
hands
upon
a
straw
of
my
property
he
would
not
move
so
much
as
an
inch
from
the
defence
of
my
house
he
would
either
by
preserving
it
expiate
in
some
degree
the
mischief
in
which
he
had
involved
me
or
fall
and
be
crushed
to
death
in
the
midst
of
its
ruins
arguments
and
expostulations
were
useless
here
his
mind
was
worked
up
to
too
high
a
tone
to
be
susceptible
of
the
patience
necessary
for
hearing
or
understanding
any
reasoning
that
was
addressed
to
him
authority
itself
was
of
no
avail
for
the
first
and
the
last
time
he
threw
off
the
character
of
a
servant
and
appeared
obstinate
and
ungovernable
it
was
only
by
direct
violence
that
he
could
be
forced
from
the
spot
i
gave
him
in
charge
with
the
most
strict
orders
not
to
suffer
him
to
escape
from
their
custody
to
two
of
his
fellows
this
business
being
despatched
i
went
at
the
invitation
of
the
marchese
to
a
small
cottage
he
possessed
at
no
great
distance
from
my
own
house
its
situation
was
so
private
and
retired
that
few
persons
knew
or
could
perceive
that
there
was
any
building
on
the
spot
here
therefore
i
could
remain
in
the
most
perfect
safety
i
felt
myself
unaccountably
impelled
to
stay
and
witness
the
catastrophe
of
the
tragedy
i
should
not
have
been
satisfied
to
continue
in
uncertainty
as
to
what
it
would
prove
after
all
that
had
passed
like
the
marchese
i
should
have
been
apt
to
accuse
myself
of
cowardice
and
a
mind
soured
and
degenerate
if
the
mob
had
not
put
their
threats
in
execution
the
marchese
himself
was
well
pleased
with
my
determination
in
this
respect
he
was
not
yet
convinced
that
i
had
not
painted
to
myself
a
danger
which
had
no
adequate
counterpart
in
the
world
of
realities
i
had
not
long
to
wait
the
night
had
no
sooner
spread
an
and
almost
impervious
veil
over
the
world
than
the
marchese
as
if
moved
by
a
secret
impulse
to
witness
what
he
yet
refused
to
believe
came
to
me
at
the
cottage
he
had
scarcely
arrived
when
he
heard
the
confused
murmurs
and
turbulence
of
the
populace
for
we
were
near
enough
to
distinguish
almost
every
thing
as
they
did
not
meet
with
the
defence
of
the
preceding
evening
the
work
they
had
undertaken
was
presently
despatched
we
saw
the
flames
ascend
we
recognised
the
shouts
of
infernal
joy
with
which
they
witnessed
the
catastrophe
when
the
marchese
beheld
what
till
seen
he
would
never
admit
to
be
possible
he
burst
out
into
a
sort
of
transport
of
misanthropy
he
exclaimed
that
no
innocence
and
no
merit
could
defend
a
man
from
the
unrelenting
antipathy
of
his
fellows
he
saw
that
there
was
a
principle
in
the
human
mind
destined
to
be
eternally
at
war
with
improvement
and
science
no
sooner
did
a
man
devote
himself
to
the
pursuit
of
discoveries
which
if
ascertained
would
prove
the
highest
benefit
to
his
species
than
his
whole
species
became
armed
against
him
the
midnight
oil
was
held
to
be
the
signal
of
infernal
machinations
the
paleness
of
study
and
the
furrows
of
thought
were
adjudged
to
be
the
tokens
of
diabolical
alliance
he
saw
in
the
transactions
of
that
night
a
pledge
of
the
eternal
triumph
of
ignorance
over
wisdom
above
all
he
regretted
that
his
countrymen
his
dear
italians
should
for
ever
blot
their
honour
and
their
character
by
such
savage
outrages
though
myself
the
principal
sufferer
i
was
obliged
to
perform
the
part
of
the
comforter
and
consoler
and
endeavour
to
calm
the
transport
of
agony
that
seized
upon
the
susceptible
filosanto
he
was
astonished
shocked
and
beside
himself
i
viewed
the
whole
with
the
gloomy
firmness
of
a
desperate
resolution
the
worst
event
of
this
detested
evening
remains
yet
unrecorded
even
now
i
tremble
while
i
attempt
to
commit
the
story
to
my
harmless
paper
so
far
as
related
to
the
mere
destruction
of
my
property
i
looked
on
with
a
philosophical
indifference
i
had
no
reason
and
i
disdained
to
regret
the
loss
of
that
which
i
had
it
in
my
power
to
repair
in
a
moment
i
thought
i
had
taken
care
that
no
human
life
should
be
risqued
upon
this
critical
occasion
but
i
was
mistaken
i
learned
the
next
morning
with
anguish
inexpressible
that
hector
the
negro
of
the
prison
of
constance
was
no
more
he
had
eluded
the
vigilance
of
his
keepers
no
sooner
was
he
at
liberty
then
he
hastened
unknown
to
every
one
to
die
as
he
had
declared
he
would
in
the
defence
of
my
house
the
mob
had
burst
into
the
house
they
seized
him
alive
they
dragged
him
out
in
the
midst
of
them
they
insulted
over
him
as
the
special
favourite
of
the
infernal
king
they
inflicted
on
him
every
species
of
mockery
and
of
torture
they
killed
him
joint
by
joint
and
limb
by
the
pen
drops
from
my
lifeless
hand
what
right
had
i
to
make
this
man
the
victim
of
my
idle
and
unhallowed
pursuits
what
has
the
art
and
multiplication
of
gold
in
it
that
should
compensate
the
destruction
of
so
ingenuous
so
so
noble
a
creature
if
i
had
myself
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
populace
it
had
been
well
i
was
a
criminal
worthy
of
every
retribution
they
could
inflict
upon
me
some
men
perhaps
will
ask
why
i
lamented
so
bitterly
over
so
uncultivated
and
uninformed
an
individual
as
this
negro
there
was
however
something
so
truly
tragical
in
the
fate
to
which
this
creature
in
his
generosity
and
remorse
devoted
himself
that
i
believe
for
the
moment
i
felt
a
sharper
pang
in
it
than
in
the
strange
and
extraordinary
loss
of
my
only
son
or
perhaps
in
the
premature
death
of
my
beloved
marguerite
chapter
xxviii
before
the
dawn
of
the
succeeding
morning
i
turned
my
face
towards
lucca
i
beheld
the
last
cloud
of
mingling
smoke
and
flame
ascend
from
the
ashes
of
my
villa
the
blaze
sunk
its
materials
were
nearly
consumed
and
it
yielded
an
uncertain
and
fitful
light
only
when
i
withdrew
from
being
any
longer
the
melancholy
and
spectator
of
the
ruin
i
took
an
everlasting
leave
of
the
marchese
i
had
been
introduced
to
him
under
a
friendly
aspect
as
the
man
who
had
had
courage
to
perform
the
last
offices
of
humanity
to
his
unfortunate
brother
and
he
had
conceived
a
warm
affection
for
me
the
painful
nature
of
the
catastrophe
he
had
witnessed
melted
his
heart
and
he
earnestly
pressed
me
to
draw
upon
him
for
any
supplies
i
wanted
or
rather
to
receive
from
him
a
sum
equivalent
to
the
damage
the
superstition
of
his
countrymen
had
inflicted
on
me
this
i
positively
refused
but
i
found
it
impossible
to
silence
his
importunity
till
i
submitted
to
the
duplicity
of
promising
that
if
i
found
myself
reduced
to
any
necessity
i
would
not
fail
to
apply
to
him
it
was
in
the
very
moment
of
our
separation
that
intelligence
was
brought
me
of
the
fate
of
hector
the
reader
may
imagine
with
how
heavy
a
heart
i
set
out
on
my
journey
lucca
is
about
seventeen
miles
from
the
city
of
pisa
from
the
place
where
i
had
spent
the
greater
part
of
this
memorable
night
it
was
twenty
the
marchese
made
me
promise
to
take
a
serpentine
and
circuitous
route
the
more
completely
to
elude
the
possibility
of
future
danger
an
adventure
occurred
to
me
in
this
passage
with
the
relation
of
which
i
will
not
interrupt
my
narrative
which
prevented
me
from
arriving
at
lucca
till
the
noon
of
the
following
day
suffice
it
to
say
that
it
was
of
such
a
nature
that
impatient
as
i
was
under
my
present
extraordinary
circumstances
to
rejoin
my
family
i
should
have
held
myself
destitute
of
every
atom
of
humanity
if
i
had
not
submitted
to
this
short
delay
short
as
it
was
i
found
when
i
reached
lucca
that
my
evil
genius
had
been
busy
to
accumulate
for
me
new
misfortunes
marguerite
and
her
daughters
were
wholly
unknown
in
this
place
and
the
intelligence
of
the
pisan
riot
having
reached
lucca
in
the
course
of
the
day
it
was
related
to
my
wife
as
to
a
hearer
unconcerned
with
all
its
horrid
circumstances
and
the
calamitous
fate
of
our
generous
hector
by
the
hostess
of
the
inn
the
rapidity
of
events
during
the
last
part
of
our
residence
in
the
pisan
territory
was
such
as
to
have
obliged
me
to
say
little
of
the
effect
they
produced
upon
marguerite
but
the
reader
can
scarcely
be
so
inadvertent
and
unreflecting
as
not
easily
to
imagine
to
himself
that
she
felt
them
in
the
highest
degree
painful
and
overwhelming
this
last
blow
was
too
much
marguerite
had
been
some
months
pregnant
she
was
immediately
seized
with
the
pains
of
labour
and
delivered
of
a
dead
child
the
first
intelligence
communicated
to
me
upon
my
arrival
was
that
my
wife
was
dying
lucca
however
did
not
witness
the
period
of
her
existence
after
having
continued
for
several
days
upon
the
very
extremity
as
it
were
between
life
and
death
she
grew
perceptibly
better
and
in
a
week
more
though
in
a
very
feeble
state
it
became
apparent
that
her
case
was
not
a
rapid
one
we
agreed
to
proceed
upon
our
spanish
voyage
it
appeared
not
improbable
that
the
might
be
found
beneficial
and
the
experiment
was
warmly
recommended
by
her
physicians
they
were
not
however
aware
of
the
whole
extent
of
her
disorder
during
the
voyage
her
crisis
returned
with
such
malignant
symptoms
as
scarcely
to
permit
us
the
hope
she
would
reach
the
land
alive
we
debarked
at
barcelona
on
the
of
april
we
had
no
sooner
taken
up
our
abode
in
this
city
than
fully
aware
of
the
state
of
her
disease
she
assembled
her
daughters
and
poured
forth
to
them
without
restraint
that
flood
of
affection
that
ardent
spirit
of
love
by
which
she
was
distinguished
and
elevated
above
every
creature
that
lived
her
mind
was
clear
her
intellectual
powers
were
complete
and
entire
the
enthusiasm
with
which
she
now
expressed
herself
was
not
of
that
inconsiderate
nature
which
should
tend
to
make
them
feel
with
greater
acuteness
the
loss
they
were
about
to
sustain
it
was
bright
unclouded
and
serene
it
was
the
eloquence
as
of
a
disembodied
spirit
freed
from
the
perturbation
and
alloy
of
human
passions
she
reminded
them
that
they
were
sisters
and
exhorted
each
to
fulfil
the
duties
of
a
sister
and
a
mother
to
the
other
two
if
wise
and
good
they
would
be
happy
in
each
other
and
their
little
association
would
be
a
school
preparing
them
for
the
more
genuine
and
venerable
duties
for
which
nature
had
destined
them
her
views
of
all
human
things
were
altered
by
her
present
situation
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
our
reserves
and
misunderstandings
had
wrung
her
heart
but
she
forgave
me
things
which
had
lately
appeared
of
the
highest
magnitude
and
moment
faded
in
the
distance
and
mingled
with
the
vulgar
crowd
of
human
concerns
which
was
now
retiring
from
her
view
she
must
again
return
she
said
to
life
before
she
could
again
feel
the
passions
and
the
interests
of
this
petty
scene
for
the
sake
of
her
daughters
she
had
lately
desired
to
live
she
was
now
reconciled
and
content
to
die
she
had
formed
the
chain
and
link
of
connection
between
me
and
my
girls
perhaps
it
was
better
that
we
should
burst
our
fetters
and
be
free
on
the
fourth
day
after
our
arrival
at
barcelona
marguerite
expired
there
is
nothing
in
the
vast
variety
of
objects
which
this
wretched
world
presents
to
our
view
so
dreadful
and
distressing
as
the
sight
of
one
we
have
loved
but
who
is
now
no
more
i
saw
these
eyes
beheld
the
lifeless
corse
of
marguerite
great
god
of
heaven
what
is
man
and
of
what
are
we
made
within
that
petty
frame
resided
for
years
all
that
we
worship
for
there
resided
all
that
we
know
and
can
conceive
of
excellence
that
heart
is
now
still
within
the
whole
extent
of
that
frame
there
exists
no
thought
no
feeling
no
virtue
it
remains
no
longer
but
to
mock
my
sense
and
scoff
at
my
sorrow
to
rend
my
bosom
with
a
woe
complicated
matchless
and
inexpressible
the
cheek
is
pale
and
livid
the
eyes
are
sunk
and
circled
with
blackness
corruption
and
ruin
have
already
seized
their
prey
and
turned
it
into
horror
draw
for
heaven
s
sake
draw
the
pall
over
those
lifeless
features
bury
bury
them
deep
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
let
not
my
imagination
follow
them
into
the
chambers
of
the
grave
and
dwell
amidst
pestilential
damps
and
all
the
series
of
destruction
let
me
recollect
all
that
marguerite
was
as
she
lived
her
numerous
accomplishments
her
unparalleled
virtues
ay
in
all
the
magnitude
and
wealth
of
their
detail
for
that
is
a
divine
and
celestial
madness
but
let
me
not
recollect
her
as
i
saw
her
on
the
bier
lest
i
become
raving
and
blaspheme
i
have
no
power
to
talk
of
the
situation
in
which
i
was
now
placed
and
the
reader
must
therefore
explain
it
for
himself
if
he
can
i
never
loved
but
once
i
never
loved
but
marguerite
all
other
affection
is
stillness
and
ice
compared
with
this
this
is
the
great
crisis
of
my
history
the
gap
between
life
and
death
the
gulf
that
cut
me
off
for
ever
from
every
thing
that
deserves
the
name
of
human
such
was
the
legacy
of
the
stranger
my
son
an
exile
myself
publicly
arraigned
as
a
murderer
the
unmerited
and
tragical
death
of
hector
the
premature
and
loss
of
the
better
half
of
my
soul
who
would
have
believed
that
this
envenomed
gift
would
in
less
than
two
years
have
thus
dreadfully
changed
the
face
of
my
affairs
and
destroyed
every
thing
that
composed
the
happiness
of
my
life
after
some
delay
in
this
wretched
and
town
of
barcelona
such
it
has
ever
since
appeared
to
my
thoughts
we
proceeded
to
madrid
the
reader
will
give
me
credit
when
i
tell
him
that
however
eager
i
had
lately
felt
to
exhibit
my
magnificence
and
my
wealth
i
had
no
such
eagerness
now
i
speak
no
more
of
the
character
of
marguerite
i
attempt
not
to
compose
her
panegyric
the
story
of
her
life
is
the
best
record
of
her
virtues
her
defects
if
defects
she
had
drew
their
pedigree
from
rectitude
of
sentiment
and
perception
from
the
most
generous
sensibility
from
a
heart
pervaded
and
leavened
with
tenderness
a
simple
stone
in
the
western
aisle
of
the
great
church
at
barcelona
records
her
personal
and
her
family
name
with
this
single
addition
the
preserver
of
her
family
in
poverty
and
ruin
the
victim
of
her
disconsolate
and
repentant
husband
s
unhallowed
wealth
but
dismissing
for
ever
and
henceforth
consigning
to
unviolated
silence
her
excellencies
could
i
avoid
feeling
that
i
could
never
again
form
a
similar
or
indeed
any
real
union
so
long
as
i
existed
being
now
indeed
more
than
forty
years
of
age
having
spent
near
twenty
of
that
forty
in
a
most
enviable
wedlock
and
being
blessed
with
a
sufficiently
numerous
offspring
it
may
be
thought
perhaps
i
might
be
contented
but
without
discussing
the
propriety
of
such
a
maxim
as
it
relates
to
the
species
in
general
it
must
be
recollected
in
my
case
that
my
youth
was
to
be
recommenced
by
a
perpetual
series
of
renewals
i
never
gave
credit
to
that
axiom
of
a
sickly
sensibility
that
it
is
a
sacrilege
in
him
who
has
been
engaged
in
one
cordial
and
happy
union
ever
to
turn
his
thoughts
to
another
much
more
reasonable
than
this
is
the
indian
doctrine
that
the
survivor
ought
to
leap
into
the
flames
and
perish
upon
the
funeral
pyre
of
the
deceased
while
we
live
it
is
one
of
our
most
imperious
duties
to
seek
our
happiness
he
that
dedicates
his
days
to
an
endless
sorrow
is
the
worst
and
most
degraded
of
suicides
it
is
an
important
question
in
the
economy
of
human
life
up
to
what
age
we
should
allow
ourselves
to
contract
engagements
to
a
wife
and
a
probable
offspring
but
separately
from
this
consideration
i
should
hold
that
in
many
cases
he
who
entered
into
a
second
marriage
by
that
action
yielded
a
pure
and
honourable
homage
to
the
manes
of
the
first
but
from
genuine
marriage
i
was
henceforth
for
ever
debarred
an
immortal
can
form
no
true
and
real
attachment
to
the
insect
of
an
hour
mourning
a
depressing
and
speechless
regret
was
yet
the
inmate
of
our
house
grief
does
not
commonly
lay
a
strong
and
invincible
hold
of
us
in
the
morning
of
our
days
and
though
the
temper
of
julia
was
perhaps
at
her
age
the
most
tender
and
susceptible
i
ever
knew
even
she
who
was
now
in
her
seventeenth
year
reaped
the
benefit
of
that
elasticity
which
in
early
life
is
the
portion
of
humanity
nothing
material
occurred
to
us
in
the
first
three
months
of
our
residence
in
madrid
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
be
surrounded
with
a
more
lovely
and
blooming
family
than
i
was
yet
from
happiness
i
was
immeasurably
distant
exclusively
of
my
recent
and
in
every
sense
irreparable
loss
my
mind
was
full
of
dark
and
gloomy
forebodings
i
feared
not
for
myself
but
i
had
an
unconquerable
alarm
and
apprehension
for
my
children
my
youngest
was
but
ten
years
of
age
the
eldest
was
not
seventeen
sweet
tender
blossoms
that
the
cruelty
and
hardness
of
mankind
might
so
easily
blight
and
that
required
a
concurrence
of
favourable
circumstances
to
ripen
into
all
they
were
capable
of
becoming
when
i
recollected
what
had
happened
in
the
course
of
the
last
two
years
i
could
not
flatter
myself
that
our
misfortunes
were
at
an
end
or
that
i
had
not
to
speak
moderately
many
fierce
trials
yet
to
encounter
i
seemed
like
the
tree
of
java
to
be
destined
to
shelter
only
to
destroy
and
to
prove
a
deadly
poison
to
whatever
sought
its
refuge
under
my
protecting
branches
in
this
melancholy
frame
of
mind
the
last
words
of
my
adored
marguerite
passed
and
repassed
ten
thousand
times
through
my
recollection
she
had
formed
the
chain
and
link
of
connection
between
me
and
my
girls
perhaps
it
was
better
that
we
should
burst
our
fetters
and
be
whatever
she
had
said
was
sacred
to
the
present
temper
of
my
imagination
her
last
behest
i
would
have
died
to
execute
the
idea
contained
in
the
sentence
i
have
just
repeated
was
ambiguous
and
obscure
rather
hinted
than
expressed
but
was
it
worthy
of
the
less
attention
because
its
author
with
her
usual
gentleness
and
sweetness
had
modestly
suggested
an
advice
instead
which
she
was
well
entitled
to
have
done
of
prescribing
a
will
i
determined
to
part
with
my
children
that
i
might
no
longer
be
to
them
a
source
of
corroding
misery
and
affliction
i
believed
that
the
cloud
that
now
oppressed
me
was
transitory
i
seemed
pursued
for
the
present
by
a
malignant
genius
but
a
man
endowed
as
i
was
with
unbounded
wealth
and
immortal
vigour
can
not
easily
be
reduced
to
despair
when
the
tide
of
my
prosperity
should
unfold
its
rich
and
ample
current
i
might
easily
communicate
of
its
bounty
to
my
daughters
if
i
parted
with
them
now
i
did
not
lose
them
as
i
had
perhaps
lost
their
brother
for
ever
i
could
turn
to
a
particular
point
and
say
there
lies
my
soul
i
could
cast
my
eye
upon
a
projection
of
the
globe
and
put
my
finger
upon
their
residence
wherever
i
wandered
whether
i
were
plunged
in
a
dungeon
or
mounted
a
throne
my
heart
like
the
mariner
s
needle
would
tremble
towards
that
point
as
its
cynosure
i
had
still
something
to
love
something
to
pant
for
something
to
dream
about
and
be
happy
having
ruminated
insatiably
upon
the
last
expressions
of
marguerite
having
formed
my
commentary
and
fixed
my
predilection
i
recollected
a
person
then
a
young
woman
upon
my
paternal
estate
for
whom
my
wife
had
conceived
a
remarkable
friendship
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
peasant
her
birth
had
been
low
and
her
education
confined
but
she
had
taste
she
had
discretion
she
had
integrity
i
think
i
may
add
she
had
genius
as
marguerite
had
discovered
her
merits
and
distinguished
her
from
her
equals
she
had
been
of
great
use
to
this
extraordinary
rustic
in
unfolding
her
mind
and
guiding
her
propensities
this
was
not
so
much
a
matter
of
deliberate
and
meditated
purpose
in
dame
du
it
rose
out
of
the
circumstances
of
their
situation
they
were
almost
of
an
age
and
marguerite
frequently
invited
her
to
be
the
associate
of
her
studies
and
amusements
mariana
that
was
her
name
did
not
perhaps
resemble
my
wife
considerably
in
her
features
but
her
stature
was
the
same
her
complexion
and
the
colour
of
her
hair
the
similarity
in
carriage
and
gesture
mariana
having
never
had
an
opportunity
of
contemplating
the
accomplishments
she
admired
in
any
one
but
madame
de
leon
was
still
more
striking
there
were
points
indeed
in
which
no
human
creature
could
compare
with
marguerite
the
expressive
and
flexible
tone
of
her
voice
and
those
cadences
which
sprung
from
and
communicated
to
every
susceptible
hearer
the
divinest
sensibility
one
of
the
unhappy
consequences
of
our
exile
from
the
bordelois
was
the
misfortunes
of
mariana
her
father
had
fallen
to
decay
to
relieve
his
distress
she
had
contracted
a
marriage
not
of
sentiment
and
predilection
but
with
a
man
who
had
promised
her
that
her
father
should
never
come
to
want
this
marriage
had
been
unhappy
the
husband
was
a
prodigal
and
a
profligate
a
period
of
seven
years
however
delivered
her
from
her
egyptian
bondage
she
had
but
lately
become
a
widow
and
the
prudence
and
integrity
of
her
conduct
had
rendered
this
alliance
which
to
many
women
would
have
proved
a
rock
of
destruction
an
additional
source
of
honour
and
respect
mariana

the
death
of
her
husband
had
no
children
she
had
buried
her
father
she
was
consequently
entirely
alone
it
was
this
woman
i
fixed
upon
as
the
protector
of
my
daughters
i
was
better
pleased
with
the
meanness
of
her
extraction
than
i
should
have
been
with
one
of
the
descendants
of
the
houses
of
leon
or
damville
had
it
been
my
fortune
to
have
had
in
the
female
line
any
near
relations
on
either
side
my
daughters
were
no
longer
children
they
were
singularly
prudent
considerate
and
unimpeachable
in
their
conduct
and
propensities
they
wanted
a
protector
in
the
eye
of
the
world
it
was
desirable
for
them
that
they
should
have
an
adviser
but
i
should
have
been
grieved
and
mortified
to
give
them
a
dictator
i
wrote
to
mariana
chabot
communicating
my
project
and
requesting
her
to
give
us
the
meeting
at
lizier
on
the
frontiers
of
france
she
was
delighted
with
the
office
i
tendered
to
her
acceptance
and
readily
consented
to
every
thing
i
required
i
conducted
my
daughters
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
without
imparting
to
them
the
design
by
which
i
was
actuated
i
believed
that
they
would
of
their
own
motion
conceive
a
partiality
for
the
friend
of
their
mother
i
was
not
deceived
in
my
prognostic
the
meeting
was
an
interesting
one
the
eyes
of
mariana
overflowed
at
meeting
after
so
long
an
interval
the
husband
and
progeny
of
the
dearest
and
most
revered
friend
she
had
ever
known
the
mourning
we
wore
reminded
her
how
lately
her
incomparable
patroness
had
been
committed
to
the
grave
my
girls
were
struck
with
the
resemblance
of
mariana
to
their
mother
accident
had
prevented
us
from
cultivating
almost
any
intimate
connections
out
of
our
own
family
from
the
period
of
our
exile
my
girls
had
therefore
never
met
with
a
person
who
approached
in
any
degree
so
near
their
mother
in
accomplishments
in
skill
in
turn
of
thinking
and
opinion
mariana
came
up
to
my
warmest
hopes
as
a
protector
and
companion
for
my
children
her
unhappy
marriage
by
concentrating
her
thoughts
and
expectations
in
herself
had
perhaps
rendered
her
more
exemplary
in
carriage
and
more
elevated
in
sentiment
than
she
would
ever
have
been
without
it
at
lizier
i
passed
myself
for
monsieur
valmier
the
guardian
of
the
orphan
heiresses
of
leon
it
fortunately
happened
that
my
paternal
estate
was
at
this
time
upon
sale
i
determined
to
become
the
purchaser
and
to
settle
my
girls
in
the
scene
of
their
nativity
i
procured
an
agent
and
despatched
him
with
an
ample
commission
for
that
purpose
having
adjusted
this
point
i
resolved
to
make
a
tour
with
my
daughters
through
languedoc
dauphiné
and
the
provinces
usually
known
by
the
denomination
of
the
south
of
france
i
wished
to
familiarise
them
to
the
society
of
madame
chabot
and
to
assist
them
in
discerning
her
merits
under
a
variety
of
points
of
view
i
asked
them
whether
they
would
not
be
delighted
to
obtain
her
as
a
companion
who
might
assist
and
conduct
them
in
such
points
as
only
a
woman
of
understanding
and
experience
is
competent
to
they
every
one
of
them
listened
to
the
idea
with
pleasure
at
length
i
received
the
information
that
the
purchase
of
leon
was
completed
and
i
proceeded
to
the
critical
disclosure
that
my
daughters
were
on
the
point
of
being
separated
from
their
father
they
listened
to
the
communication
with
astonishment
and
terror
they
had
entered
successively
into
the
feelings
of
their
deceased
mother
and
i
am
well
persuaded
felt
a
less
ardent
attachment
to
my
person
than
they
had
done
at
the
cottage
of
the
lake
of
constance
but
culpable
and
criminal
as
i
had
been
i
was
not
destitute
of
every
virtue
and
they
could
not
extinguish
in
themselves
the
respect
they
had
so
long
entertained
for
me
habit
has
a
resistless
empire
over
the
human
mind
and
when
we
reflect
with
how
much
reluctance
we
consent
to
the
removal
of
a
tree
or
a
hedge
to
the
sight
of
which
we
have
been
accustomed
it
will
not
be
wondered
at
that
my
daughters
could
not
calmly
think
of
so
complete
a
separation
from
their
father
the
impression
of
their
mother
s
death
was
yet
green
and
to
lose
me
was
to
become
orphans
a
second
time
but
i
had
fully
meditated
my
plan
and
was
peremptory
that
i
might
withhold
from
them
no
advantage
it
was
in
my
power
to
confer
i
gave
them
bernardin
for
their
superintending
bailiff
and
steward
of
their
property
our
parting
was
not
less
painful
and
melancholy
than
its
occasion
was
extraordinary
and
its
mode
uncommon
it
took
place
at
the
town
of
montauban
i
saw
my
dear
children
set
forward
on
their
journey
and
i
knew
not
that
i
should
ever
behold
them
more
i
was
determined
never
again
to
see
them
to
their
injury
and
i
could
not
take
to
myself
the
consolation
on
such
a
day
in
such
a
month
or
even
after
such
a
lapse
of
years
i
will
again
have
the
joy
to
embrace
them
in
a
little
while
they
were
out
of
sight
and
i
was
alone
the
reader
will
perhaps
agree
with
me
that
no
man
had
more
exquisitely
enjoyed
the
dearest
ties
of
society
than
i
had
and
that
perhaps
few
men
were
ever
better
formed
to
enjoy
them
this
complete
and
dreadful
separation
this
stroke
that
seemed
to
cut
me
off
abruptly
from
every
thing
most
valuable
that
the
earth
contains
was
not
the
result
of
any
of
the
ordinary
necessities
of
human
life
still
less
was
it
the
dictate
of
alienation
or
indifference
no
it
was
the
pure
effect
of
love
of
a
love
so
strong
complete
and
uncontrollable
as
inflexibly
to
refuse
every
thing
that
could
be
injurious
to
its
objects
i
own
i
could
not
thus
have
parted
with
marguerite
her
idea
was
mingled
with
the
vital
springs
of
my
existence
and
scarcely
any
power
less
resistless
than
death
could
have
made
me
consent
to
pass
an
entire
day
without
her
society
but
then
it
is
to
be
considered
that
my
daughters
were
in
the
morning
of
life
their
hopes
were
untarnished
their
prospects
not
obscured
by
a
single
cloud
and
that
the
crime
would
probably
have
been
greater
obstinately
to
have
made
them
the
partners
of
my
misfortunes
and
disgrace
there
are
persons
who
will
regard
this
passage
in
my
history
as
culpable
and
the
testimony
of
a
cold
and
unsusceptible
heart
i
contemplate
it
even
at
this
distance
of
time
as
the
noblest
and
most
virtuous
effort
of
my
life
and
a
thousand
circumstances
have
occurred
since
to
induce
me
to
congratulate
myself
that
i
had
the
courage
to
achieve
my
purpose
chapter
xxix
nineteen
years
had
now
elapsed
from
the
day
that
had
witnessed
my
union
with
marguerite
de
damville
in
all
that
time
i
had
never
been
alone
alone
in
a
certain
sense
indeed
i
had
stood
at
paris
in
the
period
that
had
led
to
my
exile
and
at
soleure
in
that
which
immediately
succeeded
it
in
each
case
i
was
solitary
and
my
solitude
was
unhappy
but
my
unhappiness
was
then
in
a
certain
sense
spontaneous
my
solitude
was
a
luxury
in
which
i
felt
myself
impelled
to
indulge
he
that
has
experienced
both
will
readily
acknowledge
the
extreme
difference
between
the
misery
we
embrace
and
the
misery
from
which
we
shrink
with
abhorrence
and
loathing
i
relinquished
in
the
former
instances
my
dearest
connections
my
proper
post
and
situation
but
i
felt
that
i
could
return
to
the
one
and
resume
the
other
at
pleasure
i
repeat
it
therefore
then
i
had
not
been
alone
and
now
i
was
alone
the
same
motive
which
in
this
instance
made
me
cut
myself
off
from
my
daughters
that
i
might
not
be
the
cause
of
their
misery
forbad
me
to
be
the
parent
of
a
future
offspring
upon
whom
i
might
entail
similar
misfortune
tell
me
then
was
i
not
alone
i
recollected
the
words
of
the
stranger
wrung
from
him
by
the
excess
of
his
misery
at
the
of
the
lake
alone
alone
friendless
friendless
i
began
to
penetrate
the
enigma
of
his
history
i
fixed
my
daughters
with
an
ample
revenue
in
the
château
of
leon
i
for
them
all
my
paternal
property
i
waited
some
time
at
montauban
to
hear
of
the
event
of
my
project
and
their
final
settlement
i
learned
with
pleasure
that
they
found
their
situation
peaceful
easy
and
reputable
i
enjoined
them
that
they
should
speak
and
think
of
me
as
dead
i
led
them
to
suppose
when
i
left
montauban
that
i
should
set
out
upon
an
extensive
tour
that
i
should
traverse
the
indus
and
the
ganges
and
penetrate
into
the
furthest
extremities
of
the
east
how
uncommon
how
pitiable
a
fate
i
became
prematurely
dead
to
my
country
and
my
race
because
i
was
destined
never
to
die
the
first
sensation
i
derived
from
their
prosperity
as
i
have
already
said
was
pleasure
my
second
was
that
which
the
devil
might
have
felt
when
he
entered
paradise
for
the
seduction
of
our
first
parents
i
contemplated
with
some
degree
of
malignant
envy
a
happiness
of
which
it
was
little
probable
i
should
ever
partake
let
me
not
be
censured
for
this
let
any
man
put
himself
in
my
situation
and
say
whether
the
pleasure
he
feels
at
contemplating
the
separated
happiness
of
those
he
loves
be
not
a
mingled
sensation
with
heavy
heart
i
sought
again
the
road
of
madrid
though
my
spirits
underwent
an
extreme
depression
i
determined
not
to
desert
myself
or
the
advantages
i
had
purchased
at
so
inestimable
a
price
i
exerted
myself
to
shake
off
my
lethargy
and
rouse
the
faculties
of
my
soul
i
refused
to
give
way
to
omens
of
evil
portent
and
resolved
to
see
what
might
yet
be
made
of
my
endowments
there
is
no
misfortune
that
has
not
in
it
some
slight
mixture
of
good
my
being
now
alone
and
detached
from
every
relative
tie
left
me
at
liberty
to
pursue
my
projects
with
a
bolder
enterprise
the
mistake
of
which
i
accused
myself
in
the
former
instance
was
the
entering
too
precipitately
into
the
exercise
of
the
gifts
of
the
stranger
before
i
had
properly
measured
my
strength
and
investigated
the
use
and
application
of
my
tools
i
had
suffered
sufficiently
from
the
past
uncertainty
and
irresoluteness
of
my
march
i
determined
as
far
as
human
precaution
could
secure
its
ends
to
encounter
no
more
misfortunes
to
subject
myself
to
no
further
miscarriages
but
to
take
care
that
henceforth
the
tide
of
my
pursuits
should
move
smoothly
onward
i
dedicated
the
six
months
immediately
succeeding
my
separation
from
my
daughters
to
the
joint
contemplation
of
morals
and
natural
philosophy
i
was
resolved
to
ascertain
the
simplest
mode
of
manufacturing
wealth
the
wisest
methods
for
lulling
the
suspicions
and
controlling
the
passions
of
mankind
and
the
true
science
of
the
use
of
riches
alas
i
had
in
the
sequel
frequent
occasions
to
confess
that
though
i
had
fortuitously
entered
into
possession
of
the
leading
secrets
of
natural
magic
i
was
a
mere
tyro
in
the
science
of
man
at
least
in
the
degree
in
which
the
exercise
of
these
secrets
required
the
possession
of
it
nothing
material
occurred
to
interrupt
the
occupations
of
the
winter
my
apathy
intellectual
activity
palsy
of
the
heart
went
evenly
forward
i
made
no
acquaintance
i
was
a
mere
spectator
of
the
busy
scenes
that
passed
around
me
i
was
resolved
not
to
entangle
myself
with
rashly
formed
connections
and
it
will
commonly
be
found
that
he
whose
contemplations
are
principally
employed
upon
some
secret
and
guarded
hoard
of
reflection
has
little
propensity
to
communicate
upon
idle
and
indifferent
matters
a
slight
incident
indeed
disturbed
me
for
a
few
days
during
this
interval
but
it
passed
away
and
for
the
present
i
thought
of
it
no
more
during
the
festival
of
christmas
it
happened
that
i
felt
an
inclination
to
be
the
spectator
of
a
celebrated
that
was
exhibited
before
the
emperor
and
his
court
for
the
most
part
i
was
studious
of
privacy
i
therefore
felt
the
less
scruple
in
indulging
this
unusual
caprice
at
the
commencement
of
the
spectacle
i
was
attentive
only
to
the
exhibition
i
was
delighted
with
the
form
and
beauty
of
the
animals
with
the
freedom
and
grandeur
of
their
motion
with
the
terrible
energy
of
their
assault
and
repulse
it
was
not
long
however
before
my
eye
was
transiently
caught
by
an
individual
who
sat
in
a
gallery
at
no
great
distance
and
who
seemed
to
view
me
attentively
his
figure
bespoke
some
degree
of
refinement
but
his
eye
was
fiery
malicious
and
savage
presently
however
i
turned
again
towards
the
area
and
thought
of
him
no
more
some
time
after
by
mere
accident
i
looked
towards
the
same
gallery
and
observed
this
man
still
in
an
attitude
to
examine
me
it
seemed
as
if
he
had
not
removed
his
eyes
from
me
during
the
whole
interval
this
was
repeated
three
or
four
times
without
knowing
why
i
became
anxious
and
uneasy
i
had
a
confused
feeling
that
i
had
seen
the
man
before
but
whether
in
france
switzerland
or
italy
i
could
not
tell
i
experienced
that
sort
of
disagreeable
sensation
from
looking
at
his
face
which
arises
in
the
mind
from
an
association
of
the
object
present
with
some
mischief
or
suffering
that
was
contemporary
with
its
being
perceived
in
a
preceding
instance
i
am
now
persuaded
that
this
man
was
one
of
the
multitude
to
whom
i
had
addressed
myself
from
the
bench
on
the
hill
a
short
time
before
my
flight
from
pisa
and
that
he
was
among
the
most
eager
to
interrupt
and
molest
me
but
he
was
apparently
a
spaniard
by
birth
and
i
could
not
at
this
time
develope
the
mystery
that
hung
about
his
features
finding
that
i
could
neither
rid
myself
of
his
curious
and
watchful
observation
nor
of
the
disturbance
it
gave
me
i
withdrew
from
the
gallery
where
i
had
hitherto
been
sitting
and
removed
to
another
gallery
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
area
about
half
an
hour
after
looking
accidentally
round
i
saw
this
very
man
at
my
elbow
i
then
accosted
him
with
the
enquiry
do
you
know
me
sir
to
which
he
immediately
returned
with
a
pure
castilian
accent
señor
he
then
began
to
be
more
reserved
in
his
attention
to
me
without
however
entirely
withdrawing
it
as
soon
as
the
entertainment
was
over
i
went
away
and
saw
no
more
of
my
spaniard
i
began
to
tax
myself
with
pusillanimity
in
suffering
so
insignificant
an
incident
to
disturb
me
a
few
days
after
however
i
suddenly
lighted
upon
him
in
the
street
he
was
talking
to
three
or
four
of
his
countrymen
and
in
the
progress
of
his
discourse
frequently
pointed
to
me
i
could
now
perceive
something
particularly
hostile
and
ferocious
in
his
countenance
the
first
impulse
i
felt
was
that
i
would
no
longer
suffer
the
unquietness
and
anxiety
the
sight
of
him
produced
in
me
but
would
go
up
to
him
and
force
him
to
an
explanation
i
believed
however
that
in
the
temper
he
indicated
this
could
not
be
done
without
involving
myself
in
a
quarrel
and
i
thought
it
wiser
to
endeavour
to
conquer
in
silence
an
unreasonable
sensation
i
therefore
passed
on
he
immediately
broke
from
his
company
and
attempted
to
follow
me
this
i
determined
not
to
endure
i
laid
my
hand
on
my
sword
with
a
peremptory
look
and
waved
to
him
to
desist
his
countenance
then
assumed
an
air
of
diabolical
malignity
he
shook
his
head
furiously
and
turned
down
another
street
a
strange
sort
of
animosity
this
between
two
persons
utter
strangers
to
each
other
and
which
had
as
yet
not
deigned
to
express
itself
by
a
word
but
such
is
the
world
we
hate
we
know
not
why
we
are
ready
to
cut
each
other
s
throats
because
we
do
not
like
the
turn
of
a
feature
or
the
adjustment
of
a
prejudice
party
difference
of
countries
difference
of
religions
and
a
thousand
wild
chimeras
of
fanaticism
or
superstition
are
continually
arming
us
against
a
man
of
whose
virtues
and
qualities
we
are
ignorant
and
into
whose
benevolent
or
evil
intentions
we
disdain
to
enquire
i
saw
this
spaniard
but
once
more
it
was
as
i
was
on
the
point
of
entering
the
house
a
part
of
which
i
occupied
i
was
particularly
mortified
at
this
circumstance
it
was
plain
the
man
entertained
for
whatever
reason
a
determined
animosity
against
me
and
i
was
grieved
to
furnish
him
with
that
advantage
for
injuring
me
which
consisted
in
being
acquainted
with
the
place
of
my
residence
i
would
have
turned
away
and
gone
down
the
street
but
i
had
too
fully
marked
my
design
of
entering
the
house
before
i
reconnoitered
my
enemy
the
displeasure
i
felt
was
so
unaccountably
great
that
it
was
with
difficulty
my
courage
got
the
better
of
it
and
i
determined
not
to
change
the
place
of
my
abode
in
a
short
time
however
as
i
have
already
said
i
thought
of
this
incident
no
more
that
it
should
have
disturbed
and
unhinged
me
in
the
degree
that
it
had
done
even
for
a
moment
was
a
thing
i
could
not
account
for
had
the
calamities
in
which
the
legacy
of
the
stranger
involved
me
converted
me
in
so
short
a
time
from
a
knight
and
a
soldier
into
a
character
of
that
morbid
timidity
as
to
tremble
at
every
shadow
or
is
there
in
some
human
countenances
a
fascination
a
sort
of
mysterious
sympathy
and
presentiment
that
makes
us
cower
and
quail
whenever
we
meet
their
several
weeks
now
passed
away
and
i
had
nearly
forgotten
all
the
circumstances
of
this
seemingly
foolish
story
when
in
a
little
excursion
i
chanced
to
make
from
madrid
to
a
place
about
twelve
miles
distant
i
was
overtaken
upon
the
road
by
a
cavalier
of
respectable
appearance
who
presently
took
occasion
to
enter
into
conversation
with
me
he
explained
to
me
several
of
the
objects
that
presented
themselves
on
either
side
told
the
names
of
the
different
nobility
and
grandees
who
occupied
the
villas
we
saw
and
sometimes
entered
into
the
particulars
of
their
history
i
at
first
gave
little
encouragement
to
this
communicative
traveller
but
there
was
something
so
polite
in
his
manner
and
intelligent
in
his
discourse
that
i
could
not
prevail
upon
myself
to
treat
him
with
rudeness
or
disrespect
after
having
talked
for
some
time
upon
indifferent
topics
he
led
to
the
general
state
of
literature
in
europe
few
subjects
could
appear
less
dangerous
than
this
as
there
were
few
upon
which
i
felt
myself
better
qualified
to
converse
by
degrees
i
threw
off
some
of
my
original
reserve
and
i
found
my
companion
well
informed
and
ingenious
lively
in
his
manner
and
pertinent
in
his
remarks
by
this
time
the
unknown
having
discovered
that
i
had
only
come
from
madrid
for
a
day
s
relaxation
invited
himself
to
dine
with
me
at
my
inn
i
departed
from
my
established
system
of
conduct
on
this
occasion
and
admitted
his
overture
after
dinner
he
gave
me
some
account
of
himself
and
his
family
and
seemed
to
expect
from
me
a
similar
explicitness
i
was
less
pleased
with
him
in
this
particular
than
i
had
been
with
his
frank
and
undesigning
conversation
on
the
road
strictly
speaking
however
the
expectation
implied
was
only
a
breach
of
politeness
i
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
foresaw
it
to
be
particularly
offensive
to
me
observing
my
backwardness
he
immediately
changed
the
subject
presently
he
remarked
that
by
my
physiognomy
and
accent
he
perceived
i
was
a
frenchman
and
asked
me
if
i
had
known
cornelius
agrippa
who
died
about
twelve
years
before
at
grenoble
i
answered
in
the
negative
the
unknown
then
entered
into
a
warm
eulogium
of
the
talents
of
agrippa
inveighed
against
the
illiberal
treatment
he
had
experienced
in
consequence
of
his
supposed
proficiency
in
magic
and
spoke
with
great
asperity
of
the
priests
and
inquisitors
who
had
been
his
persecutors
i
became
attentive
watchful
and
suspicious
he
went
on
to
expatiate
upon
the
praises
of
the
art
magic
which
nothing
he
said
but
the
jealousy
of
churchmen
had
brought
into
disrepute
affirmed
that
it
had
been
treated
with
respect
and
counted
illustrious
by
the
ancients
in
the
instance
of
pythagoras
apollonius
tyaneus
and
others
and
expressed
a
great
desire
to
become
a
student
of
the
art
himself
this
kind
of
discourse
made
me
repent
that
i
had
been
drawn
in
so
far
as
to
sit
down
with
this
unknown
and
admit
him
as
my
companion
of
the
day
during
the
whole
time
he
was
the
principal
speaker
sometimes
he
paused
with
a
seeming
desire
to
hear
my
sentiments
but
i
had
now
formed
my
resolution
and
gave
him
no
encouragement
presently
after
i
called
for
my
horse
i
should
have
observed
that
his
servant
who
followed
him
engaged
in
conversation
with
mine
at
the
same
time
that
the
dialogue
began
between
their
masters
seeing
me
about
to
depart
the
unknown
motioned
as
if
to
accompany
me
upon
this
i
became
serious
said
i
i
have
now
had
the
pleasure
of
your
company
to
dinner
i
am
going
home
and
have
the
honour
to
bid
you
farewell
it
is
neither
my
disposition
nor
the
habit
of
the
grave
and
dignified
nation
among
whom
i
at
present
reside
to
form
permanent
acquaintances
upon
casual
rencounters
you
will
not
therefore
think
i
violate
the
hospitality
for
which
i
am
indebted
to
them
if
i
intimate
to
you
my
desire
to
return
all
this
i
said
with
the
grave
and
formal
tone
becoming
a
spaniard
and
the
unknown
had
nothing
to
reply
it
was
evident
however
that
my
dryness
chagrined
him
and
he
even
muttered
words
of
resentment
between
his
teeth
i
could
observe
now
a
degree
of
hostility
and
fury
in
his
countenance
which
remarkably
contrasted
with
the
pliancy
and
obligingness
of
his
preceding
demeanour
i
took
no
notice
however
of
these
circumstances
and
rode
away
i
have
since
had
sufficient
reasons
to
convince
me
that
these
two
persons
whose
story
but
for
that
explanation
may
appear
to
the
reader
exceedingly
frivolous
were
the
one
an
informer
and
the
other
a
spy
of
the
holy
inquisition
the
man
who
had
seen
me
at
pisa
had
his
imagination
terrified
and
his
superstition
set
in
arms
by
all
that
he
had
heard
of
me
in
that
place
and
thought
he
could
not
perform
a
more
meritorious
work
than
by
giving
intelligence
to
the
fathers
what
sort
of
person
had
taken
refuge
in
the
metropolis
of
this
most
catholic
kingdom
it
was
with
this
view
he
had
watched
me
and
at
length
by
an
accident
he
deemed
peculiarly
fortunate
lodged
me
in
my
proper
habitation
having
given
in
his
denunciation
my
travelling
companion
was
next
fastened
on
me
by
the
contrivance
and
zeal
of
the
fathers
inquisitors
he
was
a
familiar
of
the
holy
office
and
it
is
well
known
that
persons
of
the
fairest
prospects
and
most
polite
education
in
spain
are
led
by
their
religious
impressions
to
place
a
pride
in
performing
menial
and
even
perfidious
offices
in
the
service
of
the
inquisition
the
kind
of
dishonour
i
put
upon
him
in
parting
though
of
a
nature
he
could
not
openly
resent
i
fear
conspired
with
his
zeal
for
god
s
and
the
church
s
honour
to
induce
him
to
relate
a
story
concerning
me
more
modelled
by
the
bitterness
of
his
personal
feelings
than
distinguished
by
a
regard
to
truth
such
was
the
snare
woven
and
drawing
close
round
me
on
all
sides
for
my
destruction
i
was
made
uneasy
by
the
rencounter
of
the
traveller
but
by
no
means
aware
of
the
whole
extent
of
the
mischief
that
impended
over
me
when
i
came
to
retrace
point
by
point
the
discourse
he
had
held
i
could
not
conceive
that
the
turn
it
had
taken
originated
in
accident
i
perceived
with
no
little
grief
of
heart
and
concern
that
i
was
known
it
was
however
necessary
that
i
should
reflect
maturely
upon
the
conduct
to
be
pursued
by
me
i
ought
not
gratuitously
to
expose
myself
to
danger
but
then
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
point
of
general
wisdom
and
was
particularly
incumbent
in
my
extraordinary
circumstances
not
to
suffer
vigilance
to
degenerate
into
restless
anxiety
it
would
be
easy
for
me
if
i
were
not
strictly
on
my
guard
continually
to
find
food
for
suspicion
and
to
surround
myself
with
imaginary
plots
and
dangers
this
was
a
vice
that
i
was
willing
enough
to
pity
in
others
but
there
was
no
character
that
i
more
cordially
disdained
for
myself
there
was
none
more
pointedly
in
opposition
to
that
gallant
generous
confiding
spirit
which
had
distinguished
those
military
heroes
of
my
native
soil
who
had
been
the
exclusive
object
of
my
earliest
admiration
and
whom
in
my
present
dejected
and
deserted
situation
i
still
desired
to
resemble
when
i
came
to
reflect
i
easily
perceived
that
this
vice
was
particularly
allied
to
a
life
of
solitude
and
that
he
who
is
cut
off
from
the
genuine
and
happy
connections
of
husband
father
and
friend
is
of
all
men
most
liable
in
their
absence
to
conjure
up
for
himself
the
unnatural
intercourses
and
reciprocations
of
hostility
it
was
thus
that
i
artificially
reconciled
myself
to
my
situation
and
obstinately
closed
my
eyes
upon
those
equivocal
demonstrations
of
danger
which
from
time
to
time
were
presented
to
my
view
chapter
xxx
such
was
the
state
of
my
mind
when
it
happened
one
gloomy
evening
in
the
latter
end
of
march
that
my
valet
announced
to
me
three
gentlemen
who
were
come
to
visit
me
it
was
strange
i
had
no
visitors
i
indulged
no
relaxation
but
that
of
the
street
and
of
public
places
do
you
know
who
they
are
said
i
accidentally
looked
up
and
saw
paleness
and
terror
written
in
his
countenance
he
had
not
however
time
to
reply
before
they
burst
into
the
room
they
were
alguazils
of
the
inquisition
they
told
me
their
errand
was
to
conduct
me
to
the
holy
office
i
submitted
and
accompanied
them
it
was
already
dark
they
put
me
into
a
litter
with
the
curtains
drawn
and
then
arranged
themselves
in
silence
one
on
each
side
while
one
brought
up
the
rear
i
was
taken
by
surprise
nothing
could
be
further
from
my
expectation
than
such
an
event
as
we
passed
along
i
ruminated
with
myself
on
the
line
of
conduct
it
was
incumbent
on
me
to
pursue
to
make
an
immediate
experiment
of
the
fidelity
of
my
guides
was
a
doubtful
attempt
if
for
want
of
time
and
the
opportunity
of
a
tranquil
hearing
i
miscarried
with
them
the
trial
would
be
converted
into
evidence
against
me
if
i
succeeded
i
had
then
to
escape
out
of
spain
in
the
centre
of
which
i
now
was
from
the
hostility
of
a
tribunal
which
was
said
to
surpass
all
the
tribunals
on
the
face
of
the
earth
in
activity
and
vigilance
i
knew
of
nothing
that
the
fathers
of
the
inquisition
could
have
against
me
i
had
lived
in
the
most
entire
seclusion
and
i
could
defy
any
one
to
report
a
single
action
of
mine
since
i
had
entered
spain
to
my
prejudice
i
had
been
wholly
occupied
with
melancholy
reflections
on
the
past
and
solitary
inventions
and
devices
which
i
purposed
to
bring
forward
for
the
future
i
determined
not
to
live
for
ever
the
slave
of
fear
i
believed
that
the
best
method
for
defeating
a
danger
in
many
cases
was
undauntedly
to
encounter
it
and
i
did
not
imagine
that
i
could
have
a
more
favourable
opportunity
for
that
purpose
than
the
present
i
had
heard
much
indeed
of
the
terrors
of
the
inquisition
but
a
generous
and
liberal
spirit
lends
no
very
attentive
ear
to
horrors
the
trite
and
vulgar
rumour
of
which
only
has
reached
him
i
disdained
to
be
blown
down
with
a
breath
i
believed
that
the
inquisition
itself
would
not
venture
to
proceed
criminally
against
a
man
against
whom
nothing
criminal
had
been
alleged
in
every
event
i
believed
it
would
never
be
too
late
to
have
recourse
to
my
peculiar
prerogatives
upon
entering
the
prison
of
the
inquisition
i
was
first
conducted
to
a
solitary
cell
it
is
not
my
intention
to
treat
of
those
particulars
of
the
holy
office
which
are
already
to
be
found
in
innumerable
publications
i
have
no
pleasure
in
reviving
the
images
of
this
sojourn
of
horrors
i
know
it
is
unreasonable
to
despise
a
man
for
the
miseries
and
wretchedness
he
has
endured
but
i
know
that
such
is
the
human
heart
and
i
will
not
expose
myself
to
be
scoffed
at
and
trampled
upon
for
my
misfortunes
i
found
myself
under
the
necessity
while
in
the
inquisition
of
submitting
to
that
most
profligate
of
all
impositions
an
oath
of
secrecy
as
to
what
i
had
seen
and
what
i
had
suffered
and
whatever
may
be
the
strict
morality
of
such
an
obligation
i
will
not
ambitiously
thrust
myself
forward
in
violation
of
it
i
will
restrict
the
story
i
have
to
relate
to
the
peculiarities
that
characterised
my
case
and
enter
as
little
as
possible
into
the
general
policy
of
this
frontier
intrenchment
of
the
christian
faith
when
i
was
brought
up
to
be
interrogated
i
was
assailed
with
innumerable
questions
the
obvious
purport
of
which
was
as
much
as
possible
to
extort
from
me
evidence
of
every
kind
that
might
be
injurious
to
my
cause
the
object
of
the
inquisition
is
to
defend
our
holy
mother
the
church
from
whatever
might
defile
her
sanctity
and
whiteness
every
thing
that
calls
into
question
the
truth
of
her
doctrines
that
pollutes
and
turns
from
their
original
purpose
any
of
her
ordinances
or
that
implies
commerce
and
league
with
the
invisible
enemy
of
saints
it
is
its
peculiar
province
to
investigate
the
fathers
are
therefore
particularly
cautious
that
they
may
not
by
confining
their
questions
too
much
to
a
single
object
preclude
themselves
from
the
chance
of
discovering
danger
under
all
the
forms
it
may
assume
it
is
presumed
that
he
who
is
a
corrupt
member
of
the
church
of
christ
in
one
point
is
unsound
and
unfaithful
in
others
the
inquisitor
who
examined
me
first
demanded
whether
i
were
informed
for
what
cause
i
was
brought
before
that
tribunal
whether
i
did
not
find
myself
able
to
conjecture
the
nature
of
my
offence
whether
i
did
not
know
the
sort
of
crimes
for
which
men
were
detained
in
that
prison
he
then
desired
me
to
recollect
myself
and
consider
whether
i
were
not
conscious
of
offence
against
the
holy
catholic
church
whether
i
had
never
asserted
or
maintained
any
doctrines
contrary
to
what
mother
church
asserts
and
maintains
whether
i
had
never
to
my
knowledge
defiled
any
of
the
ordinances
of
god
or
applied
things
sacred
to
unholy
and
profane
purposes
whether
i
had
never
invocated
the
devil
whether
i
had
never
held
any
commerce
or
entered
into
any
league
with
the
enemy
of
saints
whether
i
had
never
performed
or
sought
to
perform
preternatural
and
miraculous
acts
by
unholy
means
whether
i
had
never
vexed
or
sought
to
vex
those
against
whom
i
had
enmity
by
secret
and
forbidden
arts
whether
i
had
never
resided
in
countries
the
inhabitants
of
which
were
heretics
and
whether
i
had
never
listened
to
their
discourses
and
arguments
whether
when
i
inhabited
such
countries
i
had
never
assisted
at
the
celebration
of
divine
ordinances
performed
by
heretics
or
in
a
form
which
holy
church
disapproves
or
condemns
finding
that
he
could
gain
nothing
upon
me
by
these
general
interrogatories
the
inquisitor
next
descended
to
particulars
he
enquired
concerning
the
incidents
of
my
pisan
story
which
having
first
assured
myself
from
the
train
of
his
questions
that
some
representation
of
that
unfortunate
affair
had
reached
his
ear
i
willingly
related
to
the
same
extent
that
i
had
previously
done
to
the
marchese
filosanto
he
then
proceeded
to
a
great
number
of
questions
the
source
of
which
is
to
be
traced
to
the
commonly
received
notions
respecting
sorcerers
and
necromancers
they
were
so
artfully
contrived
and
so
large
in
their
scope
that
it
was
not
easy
to
guess
whether
they
related
to
any
particular
accusation
alleged
against
me
or
were
formed
entirely
on
general
principles
yet
some
of
them
were
so
minute
so
connected
and
arranged
so
perfectly
in
series
that
i
could
not
but
believe
they
were
an
echo
of
the
calumnies
invented
against
me
at
pisa
of
which
however
as
i
had
never
collected
any
regular
and
detailed
account
i
could
not
accurately
trace
the
influence
on
the
present
occasion
the
inquisitor
demanded
of
me
whether
i
had
never
seen
or
held
conversation
with
any
supernatural
being
or
the
spirit
of
a
man
departed
whether
i
had
never
practised
diabolical
arts
to
raise
the
dead
whether
i
had
never
had
a
familiar
in
the
form
of
some
insect
domestic
animal
or
reptile
he
was
particularly
subtle
and
copious
in
his
questions
respecting
the
history
of
my
unfortunate
dog
endeavouring
to
surprise
me
in
some
slip
or
contradiction
in
what
i
affirmed
on
the
subject
he
asked
whether
i
had
never
assumed
a
form
different
from
my
real
one
either
a
different
age
and
appearance
or
a
different
species
of
animal
whether
i
had
never
by
the
agency
of
my
demon
inflicted
sickness
or
death
whether
i
had
never
caused
the
mortality
of
cattle
whether
i
had
not
the
power
of
being
in
two
places
at
once
whether
i
had
never
been
seen
riding
through
the
air
whether
i
had
never
been
wounded
in
my
absence
by
a
blow
aimed
at
my
astral
spirit
or
apparition
whether
i
had
never
possessed
books
of
conjuration
or
the
art
magic
whether
it
had
never
happened
to
me
that
an
indifferent
person
indiscreetly
perusing
a
spell
or
incantation
in
my
possession
had
been
maimed
or
killed
by
the
spirits
he
had
undesignedly
evoked
a
further
object
particularly
pursued
in
my
interrogatory
was
the
detection
of
my
property
and
the
questions
constructed
for
this
purpose
were
uncommonly
artful
and
multiplied
the
inquisitor
told
me
that
the
holy
office
was
by
the
nature
of
its
institution
the
guardian
and
administrator
of
every
person
that
fell
under
its
animadversion
shut
up
he
said
as
i
must
be
during
the
pendency
of
my
cause
and
separated
from
the
rest
of
mankind
i
was
wholly
incapable
of
superintending
my
worldly
affairs
which
unless
they
were
properly
looked
into
might
in
the
interval
be
materially
injured
i
ought
therefore
implicitly
and
without
reserve
to
refer
myself
in
this
point
to
the
care
of
the
fathers
if
my
innocence
were
established
as
he
hoped
and
earnestly
prayed
to
the
mother
of
god
and
the
saints
of
jesus
might
ultimately
happen
i
should
find
the
holy
office
a
faithful
and
qualified
steward
if
on
the
contrary
i
should
be
proved
a
heretic
and
an
alien
to
the
most
high
i
ought
then
to
rejoice
in
the
beneficent
interference
of
the
fathers
who
by
dedicating
my
wealth
to
consecrated
purposes
would
mitigate
in
the
eye
of
the
just
judge
of
heaven
and
earth
the
duration
or
fierceness
of
my
punishments
in
a
future
world
the
inquisitor
had
apparently
heard
various
reports
of
my
riches
and
was
inexpressibly
chagrined
that
he
should
be
found
so
unskilful
a
member
of
his
profession
as
not
to
be
able
to
extort
from
me
a
full
confession
on
that
head
after
having
employed
every
artifice
of
menace
and
terror
after
having
endeavoured
to
soothe
and
cajole
me
by
blandishments
and
persuasion
and
finding
all
his
expedients
fruitless
he
poured
upon
me
the
full
storm
of
his
indignation
he
said
it
was
apparent
that
i
was
dealing
disingenuously
and
fraudulently
with
the
delegated
guardians
of
religion
it
was
impossible
that
the
expenditure
i
was
well
known
more
or
less
to
have
incurred
could
be
supported
without
considerable
funds
and
my
evident
duplicity
and
concealment
in
this
point
must
be
regarded
as
a
full
confirmation
of
every
crime
my
accusers
had
alleged
against
me
in
the
course
of
my
examinations
the
inquisitor
who
questioned
me
gave
himself
the
trouble
of
entering
into
a
full
vindication
of
the
tribunal
of
which
he
was
a
member
he
said
that
every
thing
that
was
valuable
to
mankind
not
only
in
a
future
state
but
also
in
the
present
depended
upon
preserving
in
full
vigour
and
strength
the
sacred
institutions
of
the
christian
faith
and
that
those
who
were
endowed
with
powers
sufficient
for
that
purpose
would
be
in
the
highest
degree
inexcusable
in
the
sight
of
god
if
they
did
not
vigilantly
and
inflexibly
maintain
the
exertion
of
those
powers
it
was
an
egregious
mistake
of
and
opinionated
men
to
suppose
that
the
maintenance
of
our
holy
religion
was
sufficiently
provided
for
by
the
clearness
of
its
evidence
it
was
no
less
dangerous
to
pretend
that
the
stability
and
duration
of
the
church
of
christ
might
be
confided
to
the
providence
of
god
providence
acts
by
human
means
and
it
was
presumptuous
for
those
who
neglected
the
means
to
trust
that
they
should
nevertheless
see
the
end
adequately
secured
why
had
providence
thought
proper
to
generate
an
alliance
between
church
and
state
and
to
place
the
powers
and
authority
of
human
society
in
the
hands
of
the
adherents
of
the
christian
faith
magistrates
and
governments
were
thus
made
the
vicars
of
heaven
and
great
would
be
their
condemnation
if
they
neglected
the
trust
reposed
in
them
the
great
adversary
of
mankind
was
incessantly
watchful
for
the
destruction
of
souls
and
while
he
spread
abroad
his
delusions
it
was
folly
to
imagine
that
evidence
alone
was
powerful
enough
to
counteract
them
what
judges
were
the
great
mass
of
mankind
of
the
integrity
and
validity
of
evidence
the
jest
of
the
scorner
was
ever
at
hand
to
turn
into
ridicule
the
most
sacred
mysteries
the
opposers
of
our
holy
faith
were
indefatigable
in
their
industry
and
as
anxious
in
their
exertions
to
deprive
their
of
every
comfort
and
hope
as
if
infidelity
which
was
the
curse
of
the
human
species
were
the
greatest
blessing
that
could
be
conferred
on
them
the
devil
was
a
hard
and
granted
no
vacation
night
or
day
to
those
who
enlisted
themselves
in
the
support
of
his
cause
it
might
answer
well
enough
the
purpose
of
the
theorist
to
suppose
that
man
was
a
rational
animal
but
they
who
had
regarded
human
society
with
an
observing
eye
knew
that
it
was
otherwise
delusion
would
ever
be
too
hard
for
evidence
and
the
grossest
falsehoods
prove
victorious
over
the
most
sacred
truths
if
what
was
illiberally
and
maliciously
styled
persecution
were
not
brought
in
aid
of
the
cause
of
religion
the
passions
of
mankind
were
on
the
side
of
falsehood
man
unrestrained
by
law
was
a
wild
ferocious
and
most
pernicious
beast
and
were
it
not
for
the
wholesome
curb
of
authority
would
speedily
throw
off
all
ties
and
limitations
human
and
divine
nothing
could
more
clearly
prove
that
the
heretical
followers
of
luther
and
calvin
who
had
lately
sprung
up
for
the
plague
of
mankind
whatever
they
might
pretend
were
in
reality
the
determined
enemies
of
all
revelation
than
their
continual
demand
that
the
cause
should
be
tried
by
discussion
and
that
every
man
should
be
defended
in
the
exercise
of
his
private
judgment
they
could
not
but
know
every
man
not
totally
robbed
of
all
power
of
discernment
must
know
that
if
this
demand
were
once
granted
it
would
prove
a
blow
at
the
root
of
every
sentiment
of
religion
the
inquisition
therefore
was
the
most
salutary
institution
that
had
ever
been
devised
and
the
future
welfare
of
mankind
wholly
depended
upon
the
maintenance
of
its
powers
and
its
maxims
by
a
moderate
and
judicious
exhibition
of
terror
it
superseded
the
necessity
of
innumerable
punishments
the
inquisition
was
not
capricious
and
uncertain
in
its
policy
it
acted
under
the
direction
of
immutable
laws
it
held
a
tender
but
a
firm
rein
upon
the
extravagances
and
madness
of
mankind
nothing
was
more
notorious
than
that
a
regular
and
systematical
proceeding
was
both
more
effectual
and
more
generous
than
one
that
was
fickle
he
defied
the
whole
history
of
the
world
to
produce
an
example
of
so
merciful
a
tribunal
the
great
end
of
its
policy
was
the
reclaiming
of
sinners
and
the
multiplication
of
penitents
who
after
a
gentle
and
salutary
discipline
were
again
by
holy
church
received
into
her
bosom
and
even
when
they
delivered
the
finally
impenitent
to
the
flames
it
was
to
the
flames
of
a
purifying
fire
which
by
destroying
the
flesh
redeemed
or
diminished
the
punishments
of
a
future
world
he
knew
that
an
outcry
had
been
artfully
raised
against
the
proceedings
of
the
holy
office
but
it
was
easy
to
see
that
its
enemies
under
the
pretence
of
compassion
for
its
victims
concealed
an
inveterate
animosity
against
property
religion
and
civil
society
the
anabaptists
had
thrown
off
the
mask
and
discovered
their
true
designs
and
the
rest
were
only
more
plausible
and
specious
in
proportion
as
they
were
more
timid
the
present
was
the
most
important
crisis
that
ever
occurred
in
the
history
of
the
world
there
was
a
spirit
at
work
that
aimed
at
dissolving
all
the
bonds
of
civil
society
and
converting
mankind
into
beasts
and
savages
who
had
not
heard
of
the
levellers
millenarians
and
who
under
the
specious
guise
of
disinterestedness
and
an
universal
love
of
mankind
had
nothing
in
view
but
the
most
sacrilegious
and
unprincipled
depredations
it
was
true
that
the
preachers
of
these
doctrines
were
utterly
contemptible
both
for
numbers
and
talent
but
it
would
be
found
a
policy
to
overlook
these
desperate
assailants
on
account
of
the
poorness
and
meanness
of
their
qualifications
for
his
own
part
he
did
not
hesitate
to
say
that
human
society
would
owe
its
preservation
if
it
were
preserved
to
the
merciful
yet
vigorous
proceedings
of
the
court
of
inquisition
the
misrepresentations
that
were
invidiously
made
of
the
present
firm
and
vigilant
system
of
policy
would
be
heard
for
a
day
and
then
universally
abandoned
posterity
he
was
well
assured
would
do
full
justice
to
the
sagacity
and
soundness
of
the
conduct
of
this
calumniated
and
much
injured
institution
the
reader
will
forgive
me
if
the
panegyric
thus
elaborately
pronounced
by
the
inquisitor
who
examined
me
upon
the
court
of
which
he
was
a
member
had
not
all
the
weight
with
my
mind
at
the
moment
i
heard
it
which
he
will
probably
ascribe
to
it
in
the
calmness
of
the
closet
it
is
so
difficult
to
be
impartial
in
our
own
cause
the
candid
mind
will
no
doubt
make
a
large
allowance
for
the
unhappy
situation
in
which
i
now
stood
and
the
bitter
and
galling
thoughts
that
preyed
upon
my
memory
but
if
i
am
chargeable
with
temporary
injustice
in
the
judgment
i
then
passed
on
the
arguments
of
the
inquisitor
i
flatter
myself
that
i
have
been
able
after
the
interval
that
has
elapsed
to
give
a
true
and
adequate
statement
of
them
beside
these
reasonings
on
the
necessity
of
a
wholesome
restraint
on
the
privileges
of
speaking
and
writing
the
father
in
another
of
my
examinations
condescended
to
delineate
to
me
the
mysteries
of
the
world
of
spirits
he
reminded
me
that
in
the
first
grand
rebellion
upon
record
that
of
the
fallen
angels
of
which
he
considered
the
present
defection
under
luther
and
calvin
as
in
some
measure
a
counterpart
a
third
of
the
host
of
heaven
had
been
thrust
out
of
the
celestial
mansions
these
accursed
spirits
had
since
been
permitted
to
pursue
their
machinations
on
the
face
of
our
earth
the
devil
like
a
roaring
lion
goeth
about
seeking
whom
he
may
the
oracles
of
the
heathens
the
temptations
of
job
and
of
our
saviour
and
the
demoniacs
of
sacred
writ
were
examples
of
the
extensive
power
which
heaven
had
thought
fit
to
allow
him
men
of
a
sceptical
and
feeble
understanding
had
been
tempted
to
doubt
whether
this
was
consistent
with
the
wisdom
and
goodness
of
god
but
though
it
was
in
vain
for
us
to
pretend
to
fathom
the
depth
of
the
divine
mysteries
there
were
certain
reasons
that
were
sufficiently
obvious
to
every
ingenuous
mind
there
were
persons
in
all
ages
of
the
world
who
like
the
sadducees
in
the
time
of
our
blessed
saviour
were
inclined
to
affirm
that
there
was
no
resurrection
neither
angel
nor
spirit
and
god
permitted
the
lying
wonders
of
infernal
agents
the
more
completely
to
confound
the
unbelief
of
his
enemies
he
who
witnessed
the
wonderful
operations
of
witchcraft
or
saw
the
ghost
of
a
man
departed
could
not
doubt
of
the
interference
of
invisible
agents
in
the
concerns
of
our
nether
world
and
if
there
were
devils
and
apparitions
it
would
be
to
the
last
degree
unreasonable
to
deny
the
existence
of
god
or
the
miracles
of
christ
these
were
to
be
received
as
the
grounds
of
the
divine
permission
of
sorcerers
necromancers
and
witches
but
the
rules
of
the
divine
conduct
were
not
to
constitute
the
rules
of
ours
he
might
permit
the
agency
of
invisible
malice
because
he
saw
things
upon
an
unlimited
scale
his
judgments
were
infallible
and
he
could
say
to
beelzebub
himself
thus
far
shalt
thou
go
and
no
those
to
whose
care
was
intrusted
the
welfare
of
mankind
here
or
hereafter
were
bound
as
far
as
possible
to
oppose
themselves
to
the
empire
of
satan
his
power
was
given
him
only
for
a
time
and
if
not
strictly
restrained
of
god
and
the
powers
ordained
of
god
it
would
every
thing
and
replunge
all
this
beautiful
scene
of
creation
in
its
original
chaos
there
was
an
endless
and
eternal
war
between
god
and
the
devil
and
the
governors
of
the
church
were
heaven
s
and
pioneers
for
carrying
it
on
of
all
the
crimes
he
added
to
which
the
depravity
of
human
nature
had
given
birth
the
most
astonishing
and
the
most
horrible
was
that
of
diabolical
commerce
that
human
creatures
should
be
so
far
infatuated
as
to
enter
into
league
with
the
declared
enemy
of
souls
and
for
the
possession
of
a
and
precarious
power
to
sign
away
their
spirits
to
eternal
damnation
was
so
extraordinary
as
to
have
been
wholly
unworthy
of
credit
were
it
not
supported
by
evidence
as
strong
and
irresistible
as
that
of
the
miracles
of
jesus
christ
himself
the
persons
who
thus
voluntarily
made
themselves
accursed
before
god
deserved
to
be
regarded
with
alienation
and
horror
by
the
whole
human
race
every
man
that
saw
them
was
bound
by
his
baptismal
engagements
to
destroy
them
and
whoever
administered
to
them
the
smallest
portion
of
food
drink
or
comfort
thereby
rendered
himself
a
party
to
their
guilt
the
inquisition
especially
had
declared
against
this
race
of
men
eternal
war
and
considered
their
crime
as
more
complicated
audacious
and
pestilential
than
any
other
branch
of
heresy
having
for
his
own
part
no
doubt
that
i
was
one
of
these
noxious
and
enormous
reprobates
he
exhorted
me
to
make
a
voluntary
confession
of
my
evil
deeds
and
by
submitting
readily
to
the
tortures
and
punishments
of
this
world
endeavour
to
free
myself
if
it
were
yet
possible
from
those
of
the
world
to
come
these
discourses
of
the
inquisitor
were
variously
interspersed
through
the
three
examinations
to
which
i
was
subjected
a
short
time
after
i
became
an
inhabitant
of
the
holy
house
on
my
part
i
endeavoured
to
the
best
of
my
power
to
repel
the
imputations
cast
upon
me
to
establish
my
innocence
and
to
confound
the
severity
of
my
oppressors
i
told
the
inquisitor
whatever
might
be
the
force
of
his
arguments
respecting
heresy
and
dealings
with
the
devil
they
were
nothing
to
me
i
was
no
lutheran
no
anabaptist
no
necromancer
no
underminer
of
the
faith
of
others
or
ally
of
the
prince
of
the
infernal
regions
i
proudly
and
earnestly
demanded
to
be
confronted
with
my
accusers
i
asked
my
examiner
in
his
turn
what
sort
of
justice
that
was
which
pretended
to
proceed
capitally
against
its
prisoners
upon
secret
and
unavowed
accusations
he
endeavoured
to
stop
me
he
told
me
that
i
was
not
brought
there
to
arraign
the
methods
and
practices
of
their
court
that
it
did
not
become
a
prisoner
put
upon
his
defence
to
insult
his
judges
that
this
contumacy
could
not
be
regarded
but
as
an
aggravation
of
my
guilt
and
that
i
was
bound
strictly
and
simply
to
answer
the
interrogatories
that
were
proposed
to
me
the
rebuke
of
the
inquisitor
was
unavailing
my
spirit
was
wrought
to
too
high
a
pitch
to
be
thus
restrained
i
was
too
firmly
resolved
to
give
the
utmost
force
of
mind
and
truth
to
the
topics
of
my
just
defence
it
is
the
practice
of
the
inquisition
for
the
prisoner
to
sit
during
his
examination
i
started
upon
my
feet
the
mode
of
your
proceeding
cried
i
is
the
mockery
of
a
trial
from
your
fatal
bar
no
man
can
go
forth
acquitted
how
is
a
story
to
be
refuted
when
hardly
and
with
difficulty
you
suffer
your
prisoner
to
collect
the
slightest
fragments
of
it
if
i
would
detect
a
calumny
is
it
not
requisite
that
i
should
be
acquainted
with
its
history
and
know
its
authors
and
propagators
then
i
may
perhaps
be
able
to
confound
their
forgeries
to
show
the
groundlessness
of
their
allegations
to
expose
the
baseness
of
their
purposes
and
the
profligacy
of
their
characters
i
am
informed
of
nothing
yet
i
am
bid
first
to
be
my
own
accuser
and
then
to
answer
the
accusations
of
others
it
is
only
by
following
a
falsehood
through
all
its
doublings
that
it
can
be
effectually
destroyed
you
bid
me
unravel
a
web
and
will
not
suffer
me
to
touch
it
with
one
of
my
fingers
the
defence
of
the
purest
innocence
is
often
difficult
sometimes
impossible
against
the
artfulness
of
a
malicious
tale
or
the
fortuitous
concurrence
of
unfavourable
appearances
but
you
strip
innocence
of
those
consecrated
weapons
by
which
only
it
can
be
defended
give
to
an
accusation
the
particulars
with
which
what
really
happens
must
always
be
attended
give
to
it
the
circumstances
of
place
and
of
time
lay
aside
the
ambiguity
and
generalities
in
which
you
shelter
yourselves
and
then
perhaps
then
only
it
can
be
victoriously
repelled
you
ask
me
a
thousand
various
and
artfully
constructed
questions
what
sort
of
a
man
do
you
imagine
me
to
be
i
am
not
a
fool
that
i
should
be
inveigled
i
am
not
a
boy
that
i
should
be
menaced
into
confessions
cease
your
base
and
unprincipled
arts
i
will
furnish
no
materials
against
myself
if
you
know
anything
against
me
avow
it
propose
it
and
i
will
answer
think
not
to
patch
up
a
miserable
accusation
out
of
the
words
which
inadvertence
or
weariness
may
cause
me
to
utter
shame
on
your
institution
may
infamy
overtake
the
system
of
your
proceedings
that
religion
which
is
supported
by
such
means
is
viler
than
atheism
that
civilisation
which
has
its
basis
in
despotism
is
more
worthless
and
hateful
than
the
state
of
savages
running
wild
in
their
woods
do
you
not
perceive
that
the
language
i
am
now
holding
to
you
is
the
exclusive
privilege
of
conscious
innocence
the
indignation
i
express
is
no
artificial
rage
studiously
contrived
to
overbear
accusation
you
have
it
as
it
flows
spontaneously
to
my
tongue
warm
from
the
promptings
of
an
honest
heart
if
i
could
have
consulted
a
friend
it
is
probable
he
would
have
dissuaded
me
from
my
present
demeanour
as
impolitic
if
i
were
governed
by
the
dictates
of
an
ordinary
prudence
i
should
have
displayed
less
ardour
less
resentment
but
i
am
willing
to
try
whether
shame
can
not
yet
be
lighted
up
even
in
the
cheek
of
an
the
father
who
examined
me
having
in
vain
endeavoured
to
check
the
current
of
my
invective
changed
his
manner
and
assumed
a
tone
diametrically
the
reverse
of
mine
he
professed
that
he
felt
much
compassion
and
interest
for
my
misfortune
and
should
deem
himself
happy
if
he
could
be
the
instrument
of
my
deliverance
the
language
i
had
uttered
was
highly
indecorous
and
such
as
seemed
in
itself
to
call
for
a
rigorous
penance
but
he
should
not
think
himself
worthy
the
name
of
a
man
if
he
did
not
make
suitable
allowance
for
the
bitter
and
extravagant
sentiments
that
would
occasionally
find
their
way
into
the
mind
of
one
in
my
unfortunate
situation
so
circumstanced
men
would
often
mistake
their
friends
for
their
enemies
i
regarded
the
inquisition
as
my
enemy
it
was
in
reality
my
firm
and
disinterested
friend
zealously
watchful
for
my
body
my
soul
and
my
estate
other
courts
had
other
maxims
of
proceeding
because
their
motives
of
action
were
different
and
it
was
but
just
that
they
should
furnish
their
prisoners
with
a
defence
against
their
frailty
but
the
breast
of
an
inquisitor
was
accessible
to
no
sentiment
but
that
of
love
a
burning
love
of
god
love
of
the
church
love
of
the
prisoner
who
might
be
wrongfully
accused
love
of
the
penitent
whom
he
reconciled
to
our
common
mother
the
church
love
even
of
the
incorrigible
heretic
whose
body
he
burned
for
the
good
of
his
soul
the
inquisitor
did
not
discover
to
the
prisoner
the
evidence
adduced
against
him
that
was
between
god
and
the
inquisitor
s
conscience
but
the
suppression
which
was
thus
practised
rendered
him
doubly
scrupulous
and
sceptical
as
to
the
evidence
he
received
he
sifted
it
with
a
severity
that
the
prisoner
would
in
vain
endeavour
to
imitate
and
the
rules
of
evidence
in
that
court
were
so
guarded
punctilious
and
minute
as
to
render
any
mistake
in
its
proceedings
altogether
impossible
for
a
man
to
be
once
a
prisoner
of
the
court
of
inquisition
by
a
salutary
prejudice
which
prevailed
through
the
catholic
world
rendered
him
for
ever
infamous
this
was
another
cause
of
the
extreme
wariness
and
caution
with
which
that
court
was
accustomed
to
proceed
they
first
listened
to
the
accuser
who
was
obliged
to
give
in
his
information
on
oath
they
then
instituted
a
secret
enquiry
against
the
party
accused
and
till
they
had
collected
abundant
ground
for
their
proceeding
they
did
not
venture
to
touch
a
hair
of
his
head
they
elaborately
classed
all
the
different
degrees
of
evidence
into
half
proof
full
proof
proof
less
than
half
and
proof
less
than
full
when
these
things
were
duly
considered
it
would
appear
certain
that
no
court
that
had
at
any
time
existed
on
earth
had
ever
been
so
tender
in
its
proceedings
so
pure
in
its
incitements
and
so
every
way
superior
to
the
attacks
of
calumny
and
malice
as
the
court
of
inquisition
with
respect
to
myself
in
particular
he
said
they
had
not
apprehended
me
and
put
me
upon
my
defence
without
previously
assembling
a
large
body
of
miscellaneous
and
circumstantial
evidence
the
evidence
they
had
drawn
from
myself
was
negative
only
but
it
was
strong
the
obscurity
that
hung
about
my
person
who
i
was
and
whence
i
came
and
the
obscurity
that
hung
about
my
fortune
a
great
visible
expenditure
in
spain
or
in
italy
and
no
visible
means
these
were
not
the
signatures
and
tokens
of
innocence
they
tended
strongly
to
confirm
the
accusation
under
which
i
laboured
yet
so
tender
was
the
inquisition
in
its
proceeding
and
so
chary
of
its
reputation
that
upon
these
accumulated
proofs
and
presumptions
they
were
not
prepared
to
pronounce
against
me
they
would
hear
me
again
and
again
they
would
give
me
time
to
recollect
myself
and
for
this
purpose
they
would
order
for
me
a
coarse
and
scanty
fare
and
a
solitary
cell
i
might
depend
upon
it
my
contumacy
should
be
overcome
the
fundamental
principle
of
their
proceedings
was
borrowed
from
that
humane
and
compassionate
maxim
of
the
old
roman
law
vita
hominis
nulla
cunctatio
est
and
i
should
accordingly
find
them
free
from
all
precipitation
and
impatience
and
ready
to
indulge
me
with
a
residence
however
long
in
their
prisons
till
my
case
had
been
sifted
to
the
bottom
chapter
xxxi
the
indulgence
thus
ostentatiously
proclaimed
by
the
was
not
exactly
to
my
taste
finding
that
all
the
energy
of
mind
i
could
apply
to
my
defence
was
vain
i
determined
to
have
recourse
to
a
different
mode
of
proceeding
i
received
three
admonitions
as
they
call
them
the
substance
of
which
i
have
already
recited
in
the
course
of
the
first
ten
days
of
my
confinement
and
i
then
for
some
time
heard
of
the
inquisitor
no
more
i
understood
that
it
was
frequently
the
practice
after
three
admonitions
not
to
bring
up
the
prisoner
for
further
hearing
during
a
whole
year
and
it
appeared
sufficiently
probable
from
the
last
words
addressed
to
me
by
my
judge
that
this
policy
was
intended
to
be
employed
in
my
case
without
further
delay
therefore
i
resolved
to
recur
to
the
expedient
in
the
use
of
which
my
power
was
unbounded
and
by
a
brilliant
offer
at
once
to
subdue
the
scruples
and
secure
the
fidelity
of
the
person
or
persons
upon
whom
my
safe
custody
might
be
found
to
depend
all
that
was
necessary
was
to
convince
the
party
to
whom
i
should
propose
the
assisting
me
of
the
reality
of
my
powers
and
then
to
put
into
his
hands
or
rather
to
ascertain
at
once
the
extent
of
his
hopes
and
demands
and
by
a
spirited
and
peremptory
conduct
to
yield
them
all
in
the
period
which
immediately
previous
to
my
present
imprisonment
i
had
devoted
to
the
meditation
of
my
future
plans
and
the
review
of
my
past
i
had
severely
accused
myself
of
half
measures
and
had
determined
to
abjure
all
hesitation
and
irresoluteness
for
the
time
to
come
it
is
not
indeed
to
be
wondered
at
that
possessing
a
power
so
utterly
remote
from
common
ideas
and
conceptions
and
which
speaking
from
experience
i
do
not
hesitate
to
affirm
no
mere
effort
of
imagination
is
adequate
to
represent
i
should
have
acted
below
the
prerogatives
and
demands
of
my
situation
this
mistake
i
would
make
no
more
i
would
overwhelm
opposition
by
the
splendour
of
my
proceedings
and
confound
scruples
by
the
dignity
and
princely
magnificence
of
my
appearance
unshackled
as
i
was
with
connections
and
risking
no
one
s
happiness
but
my
own
i
proposed
to
compel
the
human
species
to
view
me
from
an
awful
distance
and
to
oblige
every
one
that
approached
me
to
feel
his
inferiority
it
would
be
to
the
last
degree
disgraceful
and
contemptible
in
me
being
raised
so
far
above
my
peers
in
my
privileges
if
i
were
to
fall
below
the
ordinary
standard
of
a
gallant
man
in
the
decision
and
firmness
of
my
system
of
conduct
decision
and
firmness
were
the
principles
to
be
exercised
by
me
now
dignity
and
magnificence
must
await
their
turn
hereafter
it
was
not
long
before
i
embraced
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
the
man
who
waited
on
me
with
my
daily
allotment
of
provisions
and
i
designed
as
shortly
as
possible
to
proceed
to
that
species
of
argument
in
which
i
principally
confided
to
engage
him
in
my
cause
but
he
did
not
suffer
me
to
utter
a
sentence
before
with
a
very
expressive
gesture
he
interrupted
me
i
had
remarked
already
the
silence
which
seemed
for
ever
to
pervade
this
dismal
abode
but
i
had
not
ascribed
importance
enough
to
this
circumstance
to
suppose
that
it
could
materially
interfere
with
the
project
i
had
formed
i
now
perceived
the
countenance
of
my
attendant
to
be
overspread
with
terror
and
alarm
he
put
his
hand
upon
my
mouth
and
by
his
attitude
seemed
earnestly
to
insist
upon
my
conforming
to
the
rules
of
the
prison
i
was
not
however
to
be
thus
diverted
from
my
purpose
i
seized
his
hands
and
began
again
to
pursue
the
discourse
i
had
meditated
this
proceeding
on
my
part
induced
him
to
break
the
silence
he
had
hitherto
preserved
he
told
me
that
if
i
did
not
instantly
set
him
at
liberty
he
would
alarm
the
prison
i
loosed
his
hands
i
then
by
every
gesture
i
could
devise
endeavoured
to
prevail
on
him
to
approach
me
to
suffer
me
to
confer
with
him
in
the
lowest
whisper
and
assured
him
that
he
should
have
no
reason
to
repent
his
compliance
i
might
as
well
have
addressed
myself
to
the
walls
that
inclosed
me
he
would
not
stay
an
instant
he
would
yield
in
nothing
he
burst
from
me
abruptly
and
closing
the
door
of
my
cell
left
me
in
solitude
and
darkness
in
the
evening
of
the
day
of
this
attempt
the
keeper
of
the
prison
entered
my
apartment
when
he
appeared
i
began
to
flatter
myself
that
in
this
man
i
should
find
a
better
subject
for
my
purpose
than
in
the
poor
turnkey
who
had
given
me
so
unfavourable
a
prognostic
of
my
success
i
lost
no
time
in
saying
to
him
that
i
had
something
important
to
communicate
but
he
peremptorily
commanded
me
to
be
silent
and
listen
to
what
he
was
about
to
say
to
me
he
told
me
that
i
had
already
been
complained
against
for
speech
and
i
was
now
repeating
my
offence
he
advised
me
to
ponder
well
the
consequences
of
what
i
was
doing
the
orders
of
the
inquisition
were
rigorous
and
inflexible
the
cells
were
not
so
substantially
separated
but
that
a
voice
might
be
heard
from
one
to
the
other
yet
it
had
happened
more
than
once
that
a
husband
and
wife
a
father
and
child
had
for
years
been
lodged
next
to
each
other
without
the
smallest
suspicion
on
either
part
of
the
proximity
of
their
situation
he
was
astonished
at
the
pertinacity
of
my
behaviour
there
was
no
government
on
the
face
of
the
earth
he
would
venture
to
say
that
had
subjects
more
obedient
more
dutiful
and
exemplary
than
the
holy
inquisition
not
a
murmur
was
ever
heard
not
a
discontent
ever
expressed
all
was
humbleness
thankfulness
and
gratitude
he
recommended
to
me
to
conform
myself
to
my
situation
and
let
him
hear
no
further
complaints
of
me
he
had
no
sooner
finished
his
harangue
than
he
left
me
as
abruptly
as
his
servant
had
done
it
is
not
possible
to
impart
any
adequate
image
of
the
inflexibility
of
his
features
or
the
stern
composure
of
his
demeanour
i
now
saw
my
situation
in
a
different
point
of
view
bribery
was
of
no
use
where
all
intercourse
was
denied
great
god
into
what
position
was
i
got
in
the
midst
of
a
great
and
populous
city
at
this
time
perhaps
the
metropolis
of
the
world
i
heard
occasionally
from
beyond
the
limits
of
my
prison
the
hum
of
busy
throngs
or
the
shouts
of
a
tumultuous
populace
yet
i
was
myself
in
the
deepest
solitude
like
the
wretched
mariners
i
have
somewhere
read
of
shipwrecked
upon
a
desert
shore
i
might
remain
encaged
till
i
lost
all
recollection
of
european
language
and
all
acquaintance
with
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
a
jailor
from
time
to
time
entered
my
apartment
but
to
me
he
was
simply
a
moving
and
breathing
statue
his
features
never
moulded
into
the
expression
of
a
meaning
nor
his
mouth
opened
for
the
utterance
of
a
sound
from
the
first
i
had
been
struck
with
the
extreme
and
silence
that
characterised
the
place
of
my
confinement
but
my
mind
was
occupied
with
other
thoughts
and
i
had
not
adverted
to
the
cause
of
the
phenomenon
i
had
then
felt
little
inclination
to
the
converse
of
a
jailor
my
natural
disposition
was
somewhat
singular
for
a
frenchman
and
inclined
to
taciturnity
i
had
resolved
to
make
a
fair
and
ample
trial
of
the
power
of
a
just
defence
where
my
innocence
was
so
complete
and
i
was
entirely
disengaged
from
those
unfavourable
appearances
which
had
constituted
my
misfortune
at
constance
and
i
even
rejoiced
that
a
silence
which
i
regarded
as
casual
and
individual
delivered
me
from
all
fear
of
impertinence
in
my
attendant
with
how
different
a
temper
do
we
contemplate
an
incident
which
we
persuade
ourselves
continues
to
operate
only
because
we
want
inclination
to
remove
it
and
an
incident
which
is
violently
imposed
and
to
which
with
the
utmost
exertion
of
our
strength
we
can
not
succeed
to
impart
the
slightest
shock
the
external
object
is
the
same
its
picture
in
the
intellectual
sensorium
how
unlike
what
a
profound
and
inconceivable
refinement
in
the
art
of
tyranny
is
this
silence
the
jailor
might
well
tell
me
that
beneath
his
roofs
there
was
neither
complaint
nor
murmur
that
the
very
soul
of
its
inhabitants
was
subdued
and
that
they
suffered
the
most
unheard
of
oppressions
without
astonishment
or
indignation
this
is
the
peculiar
prerogative
of
despotism
it
produces
many
symptoms
of
the
same
general
appearance
as
those
which
are
derived
from
liberty
and
justice
there
are
no
remonstrances
there
is
no
impatience
or
violence
there
is
a
calm
a
fatal
and
accursed
tranquillity
that
pervades
the
whole
the
spectator
enters
and
for
a
time
misinterprets
every
object
he
sees
he
perceives
human
bodies
standing
or
moving
around
him
and
it
is
with
the
utmost
surprise
if
he
has
leisure
and
opportunity
to
observe
a
little
further
that
he
finds
at
last
the
things
he
sees
to
be
the
mere
shades
of
men
cold
inert
glaring
bodies
which
the
soul
has
long
since
deserted
wonderful
i
hesitate
not
to
affirm
is
the
genuine
and
direct
power
of
such
a
situation
as
that
in
which
i
was
now
placed
upon
the
human
imagination
what
was
it
then
to
me
to
whom
speech
was
not
merely
one
of
those
things
misnamed
indulgences
misnamed
luxuries
upon
which
the
desirableness
and
the
health
of
human
existence
depend
but
who
had
looked
to
it
as
the
only
and
the
assured
means
of
my
rescue
from
this
scene
of
horrors
i
intreat
the
reader
to
pardon
me
when
i
confess
that
the
operation
of
the
discovery
i
made
was
so
overwhelming
and
apparently
desperate
that
it
was
some
weeks
i
might
say
months
before
my
mind
recovered
its
wonted
bias
and
activity
it
was
towards
the
close
of
the
period
i
have
named
that
a
new
incident
concurring
with
that
familiarity
which
serves
in
some
measure
to
disarm
every
mischief
of
its
sting
restored
and
my
mind
i
had
vegetated
now
for
some
time
if
the
metaphor
can
with
propriety
be
applied
to
existence
in
a
noxious
and
empoisoned
air
by
which
all
vegetation
would
have
been
undermined
and
which
the
vital
principle
in
man
is
scarcely
competent
to
surmount
and
in
all
this
period
had
encountered
nothing
from
without
nor
received
any
intimation
that
could
in
the
slightest
degree
interrupt
the
progressive
destruction
and
waste
of
the
soul
one
day
at
the
customary
hour
of
my
being
attended
by
my
warder
i
was
surprised
to
see
him
bring
with
him
a
visiter
to
my
cell
the
unknown
was
a
man
with
grey
hairs
and
a
silver
beard
though
once
tall
he
now
stooped
considerably
and
supported
himself
with
a
staff
his
dress
was
simple
and
neat
and
his
whole
appearance
prepossessing
a
sweet
serenity
was
diffused
over
his
countenance
yet
there
were
occasionally
a
fire
and
a
contemplative
grasp
of
thought
expressed
in
his
eyes
which
sufficiently
proved
to
me
that
his
serenity
was
not
the
result
of
vacancy
all
this
i
discerned
by
the
faint
and
uncertain
light
of
a
small
lamp
which
the
warder
had
brought
with
him
and
placed
upon
my
table
the
introduction
was
performed
in
silence
and
the
warder
left
us
alone
the
unknown
beckoned
me
to
be
seated
for
the
first
emotion
of
surprise
at
the
entrance
of
a
stranger
had
caused
me
to
start
on
my
feet
and
opening
a
folding
stool
he
had
received
from
my
attendant
he
placed
himself
beside
me
he
then
addressed
me
in
a
low
voice
and
told
me
that
the
humanity
of
the
fathers
of
the
inquisition
had
given
him
permission
to
visit
me
and
that
if
i
would
be
so
obliging
in
conformity
to
the
regulations
of
the
prison
as
to
lower
my
voice
to
the
standard
of
his
we
were
at
liberty
to
confer
together
he
hoped
the
conference
would
be
some
relief
to
my
solitude
if
not
lead
to
my
complete
liberation
he
then
unfolded
to
me
his
story
he
told
me
that
he
like
myself
had
been
committed
to
the
prisons
of
the
inquisition
upon
an
accusation
of
sorcery
having
advanced
thus
far
he
stopped
he
talked
miscellaneously
and
digressively
of
wizards
and
their
familiars
of
possessions
and
demons
of
charms
spells
talismans
and
incantations
even
of
the
and
the
philosopher
s
stone
sometimes
in
the
progress
of
this
discourse
i
could
perceive
him
observing
me
with
the
utmost
narrowness
as
if
he
would
dive
into
my
soul
and
again
particularly
when
he
caught
a
glance
of
suspicion
in
my
eye
with
infinite
address
changing
his
attitude
and
tone
and
assuming
a
surprising
air
of
ingenuousness
and
gaiety
in
a
word
he
was
a
consummate
actor
it
was
evident
whether
his
designs
were
hostile
or
friendly
that
his
purpose
was
to
make
himself
master
of
my
secret
i
asked
him
whether
the
accusation
of
sorcery
which
had
been
preferred
against
him
were
well
founded
or
a
calumny
he
evaded
that
question
and
was
only
influenced
by
it
to
talk
more
copiously
and
fluently
on
other
topics
with
the
apparent
design
of
making
me
forget
the
enquiry
i
had
made
he
avoided
anticipation
lest
he
should
miscalculate
and
take
wrong
ground
in
my
affair
and
though
superficially
he
seemed
communicative
i
found
that
he
scarcely
told
me
respecting
himself
any
one
thing
definite
and
clear
he
celebrated
the
clemency
of
the
fathers
of
the
inquisition
he
said
they
seemed
to
regard
themselves
as
the
adoptive
parents
of
those
they
held
in
their
custody
and
were
anxious
solely
for
the
restoration
of
souls
in
their
exterior
they
were
austere
and
had
unfortunately
contracted
a
forbidding
manner
but
he
had
soon
found
upon
a
closer
inspection
of
their
character
that
the
only
way
to
deal
successfully
with
them
was
to
repose
in
them
a
perfect
confidence
this
panegyric
was
not
resorted
to
till
he
had
exhausted
the
various
topics
by
which
he
had
hoped
himself
to
extort
my
secret
from
me
i
asked
him
whether
the
effect
of
his
reposing
confidence
had
been
an
abjuration
of
sorcery
and
reconciliation
to
the
church
but
this
question
experienced
the
fate
of
every
other
that
i
addressed
to
him
he
only
told
me
generally
that
he
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
and
to
speak
well
of
the
treatment
he
had
experienced
in
the
house
of
the
inquisition
he
possessed
or
rather
as
i
believed
affected
a
character
of
thoughtless
garrulity
and
loquacity
well
adapted
to
cover
the
strange
deviations
and
abrupt
transitions
that
marked
his
discourse
it
was
certainly
singularly
contrasted
with
that
close
and
penetrating
air
which
from
time
to
time
i
remarked
in
him
the
reader
may
deem
it
surprising
and
unaccountable
but
certain
it
is
i
took
uncommon
delight
in
this
man
s
company
i
pressed
him
earnestly
to
repeat
his
visits
and
would
scarcely
suffer
him
to
depart
till
he
had
promised
to
come
to
me
again
the
next
day
or
the
day
after
yet
i
looked
on
him
as
my
mortal
enemy
and
had
no
doubt
that
he
was
one
of
the
infamous
wretches
employed
by
the
policy
of
the
inquisition
and
well
known
beneath
those
hated
roofs
by
the
appellation
of
various
reasons
may
be
assigned
for
my
conduct
in
this
particular
let
it
first
be
remembered
that
i
was
alone
and
for
months
had
not
heard
the
sound
of
my
own
voice
no
incident
marked
my
days
no
object
arrested
my
attention
a
dull
heavy
pestilential
monotony
formed
the
history
of
my
life
if
in
this
situation
i
had
been
visited
by
a
mouse
or
a
rat
i
should
indefatigably
have
sought
to
get
within
reach
of
it
i
should
have
put
it
to
my
bosom
and
have
felt
with
exultation
the
beat
of
an
animal
pulse
the
warmth
of
animal
life
pressing
responsively
on
my
heart
with
what
eager
appetite
i
should
have
mixed
in
scenes
of
calamity
and
cruelty
intolerable
to
any
other
eye
glad
for
myself
that
even
upon
such
terms
i
could
escape
the
frostbound
winter
of
the
soul
how
i
should
have
rejoiced
like
king
richard
of
england
to
see
four
grim
and
assassins
enter
my
cell
like
him
to
struggle
and
wrestle
and
contend
with
my
murderers
though
as
in
his
case
wounds
and
a
fatal
end
should
be
the
result
thus
feeling
then
it
is
little
wonderful
that
i
should
have
hailed
with
pleasure
the
visit
of
the
but
this
was
not
all
while
i
conferred
with
or
rather
listened
to
my
visiter
that
pride
and
self
complacency
which
i
suspect
to
be
the
main
or
at
least
the
indispensable
ingredient
of
all
our
pleasures
revived
in
my
heart
i
believed
that
he
was
set
upon
me
by
these
insatiable
bloodsuckers
of
the
inquisition
that
he
might
ensnare
me
with
his
questions
and
treacherously
inveigle
me
to
the
faggot
and
the
stake
i
felt
a
last
lambent
intimation
of
pride
within
me
when
my
heart
whispered
me
this
man
shall
not
attain
his
i
secretly
defied
his
arts
and
amused
myself
with
baffling
his
most
cunning
devices
i
had
now
some
one
with
whom
to
measure
myself
the
comparison
i
own
for
a
descendant
of
the
counts
of
leon
was
a
humble
one
but
it
is
not
permitted
a
prisoner
in
the
jails
of
the
inquisition
to
be
fastidious
in
his
pleasures
this
man
i
played
with
at
my
ease
and
laughed
at
his
stratagems
i
therefore
felt
that
i
was
his
superior
and
which
was
a
sensation
i
had
not
lately
been
accustomed
to
that
i
was
somebody
these
feelings
recommended
to
me
his
visits
but
what
was
much
more
material
i
looked
further
and
proposed
an
ultimate
end
to
this
occurrence
let
it
be
recollected
what
was
my
unhappiness
when
i
found
myself
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
suddenly
deprived
of
speech
and
then
it
will
easily
be
understood
how
sincerely
i
rejoiced
to
have
this
faculty
restored
to
me
speech
as
i
have
already
said
i
had
regarded
as
the
only
and
assured
means
of
my
deliverance
from
this
scene
of
horrors
i
therefore
doubted
not
that
from
this
miserable
tool
of
my
oppressors
i
would
obtain
my
enlargement
i
stood
firmly
on
my
guard
i
permitted
him
to
run
out
the
whole
length
of
his
own
project
without
interruption
by
this
delay
i
should
better
understand
his
character
and
finally
seize
it
with
a
more
decisive
grasp
thus
purposing
i
allowed
three
or
four
visits
to
pass
before
i
opened
to
the
my
own
proposal
i
designed
unexpectedly
to
turn
the
tables
upon
him
to
surprise
and
finish
with
him
at
once
i
knew
not
that
all
this
precaution
was
necessary
but
i
played
for
too
deep
a
stake
not
to
be
anxious
to
omit
nothing
which
hereafter
in
retrospect
i
might
reproach
myself
that
i
had
omitted
the
time
was
at
length
come
at
which
i
judged
it
convenient
to
execute
what
i
had
planned
in
my
mind
i
began
with
an
attempt
to
mortify
and
humble
my
guest
in
his
own
eyes
that
he
might
lose
the
pride
to
make
the
smallest
resistance
to
my
proposal
do
you
think
my
good
sir
cried
i
that
i
have
not
perfectly
understood
your
intentions
all
this
while
you
have
pretended
to
be
my
friend
and
to
come
to
me
for
my
good
i
know
that
every
secret
i
reposed
in
your
fidelity
every
word
that
i
might
unguardedly
have
dropped
every
look
and
gesture
that
could
have
been
interpreted
to
my
disadvantage
would
have
been
instantly
reported
to
the
fathers
of
the
inquisition
why
what
a
poor
and
miserable
fool
must
you
have
imagined
me
to
be
how
came
you
into
my
cell
had
you
a
secret
key
by
which
you
found
your
way
hither
unknown
could
you
ever
have
come
into
my
apartment
if
you
had
not
been
employed
you
fawn
upon
me
and
are
the
tame
and
passive
agent
of
my
merciless
destroyers
shame
on
such
base
and
perfidious
proceedings
is
this
religion
that
you
should
flatter
and
cajole
and
lie
to
a
man
purely
that
you
may
have
the
gratification
at
last
of
burning
him
alive
if
you
or
your
masters
can
make
out
any
thing
to
my
disadvantage
let
them
make
it
out
in
the
way
of
fair
and
open
trial
by
the
production
of
direct
evidence
and
calling
on
me
for
my
defence
they
style
themselves
the
champions
of
christendom
and
ornaments
of
our
holy
faith
they
pretend
to
an
extraordinary
degree
of
sanctity
and
would
have
all
men
bow
down
in
mute
reverence
and
astonishment
at
their
godliness
and
yet
they
have
recourse
to
means
so
base
that
the
most
profligate
and
abandoned
tyrant
upon
record
would
have
disdained
to
employ
them
but
base
as
are
the
judges
and
assessors
of
the
court
in
whose
prison
i
stand
even
they
scorn
the
meanness
of
the
perfidious
task
in
which
you
have
the
vehemence
i
put
into
the
suppressed
and
with
which
i
delivered
these
reproaches
seemed
to
produce
no
emotion
in
my
guest
he
dropped
his
staff
upon
his
shoulder
he
meekly
folded
his
arms
upon
his
bosom
and
answered
that
he
had
long
since
learned
to
bear
every
contumely
for
the
cause
of
god
and
the
redeemer
they
were
chastisements
which
his
manifold
sins
and
iniquities
had
amply
deserved
hypocrite
replied
i
would
you
make
me
believe
that
a
conscientious
motive
can
prompt
such
conduct
as
yours
can
mould
your
features
into
a
treacherous
expression
of
kindness
and
fill
your
mouth
with
lies
and
deceptions
innumerable
no
proceedings
rejoined
he
with
an
unaltered
air
are
base
that
god
and
his
church
prescribe
i
take
up
the
cross
with
cheerfulness
and
glory
in
my
shame
the
more
ignominious
in
the
eyes
of
an
unregenerate
world
is
my
conduct
the
more
entire
and
implicit
does
it
prove
my
obedience
to
my
heart
swelled
within
me
as
he
talked
i
could
lend
no
attention
to
such
despicable
cant
and
was
ashamed
to
see
the
most
profligate
conduct
assuming
to
itself
the
pretensions
to
an
extraordinary
degree
of
sanctity
and
disinterestedness
come
come
said
i
dissembler
i
know
that
nothing
could
buy
a
man
to
so
loathsome
an
office
but
money
you
are
some
some
wretch
who
by
your
complicated
crimes
have
forfeited
your
life
to
the
community
and
are
now
permitted
to
earn
a
miserable
existence
by
lying
in
wait
for
the
unfortunate
and
engaging
in
arts
at
which
humanity
shudders
i
take
you
upon
your
own
terms
you
are
the
man
i
want
assist
me
to
escape
go
with
me
to
some
safer
and
less
cruel
country
i
will
reward
you
to
the
extent
of
your
wishes
give
me
your
hand
an
estate
of
six
thousand
pistoles
per
annum
without
further
condition
waits
your
acceptance
i
invoke
all
the
powers
sacred
to
truth
and
punishers
of
deceit
to
witness
that
i
have
ability
to
make
good
the
whole
of
what
i
while
i
spoke
i
could
perceive
an
extraordinary
revolution
taking
place
in
my
guest
the
meekness
and
tranquillity
of
his
countenance
subsided
his
eye
became
animated
and
alive
i
hailed
the
auspicious
omen
i
urged
my
proposal
with
all
the
impetuosity
i
could
exert
and
all
the
arguments
i
could
devise
at
length
i
paused
i
looked
again
at
the
countenance
of
the
i
was
less
pleased
than
before
the
expression
did
not
seem
to
be
that
of
assent
and
congratulation
it
was
rather
of
horror
and
alarm
st
jago
and
all
the
saints
and
angels
of
heaven
protect
me
exclaimed
he
what
do
i
hear
a
full
confession
of
guilt
and
art
thou
then
the
confederate
of
the
prince
of
the
powers
of
darkness
if
we
were
not
here
in
the
holy
house
of
inquisition
i
should
die
at
this
moment
with
fear
that
the
roof
would
fall
and
crush
us
together
i
should
expect
hell
to
swallow
me
alive
for
being
found
in
thy
unhallowed
he
trembled
with
every
expression
of
the
sincerest
terror
and
aversion
thy
money
perish
with
thee
thou
second
elymas
like
him
full
of
all
subtlety
and
mischief
child
of
the
devil
enemy
of
all
righteousness
blasted
be
thy
offers
have
i
for
this
devoted
myself
to
the
service
of
god
assiduously
sought
out
the
basest
and
vilest
offices
of
that
service
and
loaded
myself
with
ignominy
here
that
i
might
obtain
a
crown
of
glory
hereafter
and
am
i
now
to
be
assaulted
with
the
worst
of
satan
s
temptations
even
so
lord
if
such
be
thy
will
oh
poor
miserable
deluded
victim
of
the
of
mankind
what
has
the
devil
done
for
thee
he
has
persuaded
thee
that
thou
art
rich
and
thou
wantest
every
joy
and
every
necessary
of
life
he
has
promised
to
be
thy
friend
and
he
brings
thee
to
the
faggot
and
flames
in
this
world
as
an
earnest
of
thy
eternal
damnation
my
visiter
had
no
sooner
thus
poured
out
the
tumult
and
agitation
of
his
soul
than
he
left
me
abruptly
and
i
saw
him
no
more
such
was
the
event
of
my
attempt
to
bribe
the
officers
of
the
inquisition
in
my
first
experiment
i
could
not
even
obtain
a
hearing
in
what
followed
my
proposals
were
rejected
with
all
the
transports
of
religious
abhorrence
what
i
offered
indeed
however
dazzling
in
the
statement
had
not
in
fact
the
nature
of
a
temptation
he
to
whom
i
addressed
it
gave
no
credit
to
my
assertions
he
thought
that
i
was
the
mere
drivelling
dupe
of
him
he
called
the
of
mankind
or
that
my
money
when
possessed
would
soon
change
its
figure
and
from
seeming
pieces
of
solid
coin
be
converted
into
pieces
of
horn
or
of
shells
even
if
he
had
not
apprehended
such
a
metamorphosis
he
would
yet
have
regarded
every
doubloon
he
received
as
the
price
of
his
continual
adversity
here
and
damnation
hereafter
i
gained
nothing
favourable
for
my
situation
by
the
trial
i
had
made
but
i
added
a
new
chapter
to
my
knowledge
of
human
nature
i
found
that
to
be
a
knave
it
was
not
necessary
to
be
an
infidel
i
corrected
the
too
hasty
conclusion
which
i
had
adopted
with
the
rest
of
my
contemporaries
that
he
whose
conduct
was
infamous
must
inevitably
be
destitute
of
religious
impressions
and
belief
and
i
became
satisfied
that
a
man
while
he
practised
every
vice
that
can
disgrace
human
nature
might
imagine
he
was
doing
god
service
enough
of
the
interior
of
the
prison
of
the
inquisition
i
remained
a
tenant
of
this
wretched
mansion
twelve
years
though
the
wretch
who
had
been
placed
upon
me
as
a
spy
was
from
my
proposal
to
him
satisfied
of
my
guilt
his
superiors
were
not
so
they
found
nothing
in
what
he
reported
definitive
as
to
the
nature
of
my
unlawful
practices
and
they
could
extort
from
me
no
further
confession
they
therefore
adhered
to
their
favourite
maxim
to
avoid
the
precipitate
mistakes
of
other
tribunals
and
to
allow
their
prisoner
full
time
to
develop
his
guilt
or
as
they
pretended
to
establish
his
innocence
perhaps
too
the
temper
of
the
prince
who
now
filled
the
spanish
throne
contributed
to
my
safety
they
could
not
content
themselves
with
a
less
punishment
for
so
obstinate
and
incorrigible
a
heretic
than
that
of
the
flames
but
during
the
reign
of
the
emperor
charles
this
species
of
punishment
for
heresy
was
rarely
inflicted
and
only
one
or
two
contumacious
at
intervals
were
delivered
over
to
the
executioner
at
a
time
the
institution
whose
victim
i
had
become
looked
for
a
richer
and
more
abundant
harvest
from
the
piety
and
zeal
of
his
successor
i
pass
over
the
rest
of
the
years
of
my
tedious
imprisonment
they
had
in
them
a
sad
and
uniformity
what
surprising
or
agreeable
adventures
can
be
expected
from
a
man
closed
up
within
the
four
walls
of
a
dungeon
yet
it
is
not
altogether
the
uniformity
of
this
period
that
determines
me
not
to
dwell
upon
and
expand
it
twelve
years
can
not
pass
in
the
life
of
man
without
many
memorable
incidents
and
occurrences
he
that
should
be
buried
alive
in
the
deepest
cavern
of
the
earth
if
he
were
not
an
idiot
or
incapable
of
the
task
of
narration
and
could
subsist
twelve
years
in
that
situation
could
tell
of
things
that
occurred
to
him
that
might
fill
the
busy
man
of
the
world
with
thoughts
and
speculation
almost
to
bursting
i
might
unfold
the
secrets
of
my
but
that
i
will
not
i
refuse
the
consequences
of
that
story
both
to
my
readers
and
myself
i
have
no
inclination
to
drive
the
most
delicate
or
susceptible
of
my
readers
mad
with
horrors
i
could
convince
such
if
such
there
are
who
suppose
my
faculties
were
altogether
benumbed
or
dead
that
it
was
not
so
i
did
indeed
pass
days
perhaps
weeks
in
a
condition
of
that
sort
but
at
other
times
my
mind
was
roused
and
became
busy
restless
impatient
and
inventive
there
was
no
mode
of
escape
that
i
did
not
ruminate
upon
or
attempt
not
to
mention
that
though
my
body
was
restrained
my
mind
occasionally
soared
to
the
furthest
regions
of
the
empyrean
or
plunged
into
the
deepest
of
the
recesses
in
which
nature
conceals
her
operations
all
systems
of
philosophising
became
familiar
to
me
i
revolved
every
different
fable
that
has
been
constructed
respecting
the
invisible
powers
that
superintend
the
events
of
the
boundless
universe
and
i
fearlessly
traced
out
and
developed
the
boldest
conjectures
and
assertions
of
demonism
or
atheism
as
the
humour
of
the
moment
led
me
i
derived
misery
or
consolation
from
each
of
these
systems
in
their
but
memory
bitter
memory
unperceived
by
its
lord
is
seizing
my
pen
and
running
away
with
my
narrative
enough
enough
of
the
interior
of
the
prison
of
the
inquisition
chapter
xxxii
philip
the
second
king
of
spain
succeeded
to
the
throne
of
that
monarchy
about
the
close
of
the
year
but
his
affairs
in
england
and
the
netherlands
long
withheld
him
from
visiting
his
beloved
country
and
he
did
not
reach
its
shores
after
a
seven
years
absence
till
the
of
august
it
may
be
thought
that
a
public
event
of
this
sort
could
be
little
interesting
to
me
a
forgotten
prisoner
immured
in
the
dungeons
of
the
inquisition
the
fact
was
otherwise
the
king
was
desirous
of
distinguishing
his
arrival
on
his
native
soil
by
some
splendid
exhibition
or
memorable
event
that
should
at
once
express
his
piety
to
god
and
conduce
to
the
felicity
of
his
people
and
he
could
think
of
nothing
that
so
signally
united
these
characters
as
an
de
the
lutheran
heresy
which
in
the
course
of
forty
years
had
spread
its
poison
so
widely
in
the
different
countries
of
europe
had
not
failed
to
scatter
a
few
of
its
noxious
seeds
even
in
this
the
purest
and
most
catholic
of
all
its
divisions
but
philip
had
early
proclaimed
his
hostility
against
this
innovation
and
prostrating
himself
before
the
image
of
his
saviour
had
earnestly
besought
the
divine
majesty
that
he
might
never
suffer
himself
to
be
or
to
be
called
the
lord
of
those
in
any
corner
of
the
globe
who
should
deny
him
the
previously
to
his
arrival
in
spain
directions
had
been
given
and
arrangements
made
respecting
the
pious
and
solemn
exhibition
he
demanded
formerly
those
who
by
the
fathers
of
the
inquisition
had
been
delivered
over
to
the
secular
arm
had
been
executed
in
the
different
places
where
their
crimes
had
been
committed
or
their
trials
been
held
but
now
it
was
proposed
that
all
those
throughout
the
kingdom
who
were
found
properly
qualified
to
satisfy
by
their
deaths
the
sublime
taste
of
the
royal
saint
should
be
divided
into
two
troops
and
sent
the
one
to
seville
long
the
capital
of
an
illustrious
monarchy
and
the
other
to
valladolid
which
had
the
honour
to
be
the
birthplace
of
the
present
sovereign
the
troop
destined
to
feed
the
flames
at
seville
was
composed
of
fifty
persons
many
of
them
distinguished
for
their
rank
their
talents
or
their
virtues
the
troop
to
be
escorted
to
valladolid
of
which
i
was
a
member
amounted
only
to
thirty
but
to
compensate
this
deficiency
philip
himself
had
signified
his
gracious
intention
to
be
present
together
with
the
heir
apparent
and
his
whole
court
at
that
exhibition
the
spanish
nation
rejoicing
in
the
approach
of
a
monarch
who
was
born
among
them
whose
manners
and
temper
happily
accorded
with
theirs
and
whom
they
believed
about
to
fix
his
perpetual
residence
in
their
land
expected
him
with
all
the
longings
of
the
most
ardent
attachment
we
the
unhappy
victims
of
pious
and
inquisitorial
tyranny
also
expected
him
our
hearts
did
not
pant
with
a
less
beating
quickness
though
our
anxiety
arose
from
emotions
of
a
different
nature
valladolid
is
distant
from
the
metropolis
miles
we
had
already
been
some
weeks
prepared
for
this
journey
and
piously
directed
to
hold
ourselves
in
readiness
to
take
our
part
in
the
solemn
national
sacrifice
we
waited
however
to
receive
a
previous
notice
of
the
day
on
which
the
monarch
would
enter
the
place
of
his
birth
since
so
great
was
his
royal
zeal
for
the
cause
of
religion
and
civil
society
that
he
would
not
consent
to
be
absent
from
any
part
of
the
spectacle
and
accordingly
it
was
not
allowed
us
to
enter
the
scene
of
our
final
destination
till
the
king
of
spain
and
the
indies
should
be
already
on
the
spot
and
prepared
to
receive
us
the
da
performed
at
seville
had
the
precedence
of
ours
it
took
place
on
the
of
september
and
we
were
indulged
with
an
accurate
account
of
it
and
were
present
at
a
public
reading
of
the
record
of
the
act
in
the
chapel
of
our
prison
previously
to
our
removal
from
the
metropolis
i
will
not
enter
into
a
minute
detail
of
the
scene
of
this
reading
though
the
recollection
will
never
be
effaced
from
my
memory
of
the
persons
present
who
were
destined
to
suffer
capital
punishment
eight
were
women
four
of
them
were
taken
from
a
single
family
being
a
grandmother
a
mother
and
two
daughters
of
the
noble
house
of
alcala
they
had
all
been
beautiful
of
person
and
of
a
graceful
figure
the
youngest
of
the
daughters
was
in
the
nineteenth
year
of
her
age
their
crime
together
with
that
of
the
majority
of
their
was
obstinate
and
impenitent
lutheranism
the
seats
of
the
women
were
separated
from
the
rest
and
fronted
with
a
close
lattice
the
men
were
in
number
and
their
appearance
was
truly
impressive
their
persons
were
neglected
and
their
figures
emaciated
their
eyes
were
sunk
and
ghastly
and
their
complexions
of
a
sallow
and
white
most
of
them
were
crippled
by
their
long
confinement
and
the
severities
they
had
endured
and
were
supported
to
their
seats
upon
an
elevated
scaffolding
with
benches
raised
one
above
another
by
two
apparators
one
on
each
side
of
the
condemned
heretic
god
of
mercy
and
benevolence
is
it
possible
that
this
scene
should
be
regarded
as
thy
triumph
and
the
execution
destined
to
follow
as
a
sacrifice
acceptable
in
thy
sight
if
these
papers
of
mine
are
ever
produced
to
light
may
it
not
happen
that
they
shall
first
be
read
by
a
distant
posterity
who
will
refuse
to
believe
that
their
fathers
were
ever
mad
enough
to
subject
each
other
to
so
horrible
a
treatment
merely
because
they
were
unable
to
adopt
each
other
s
opinions
oh
no
human
affairs
like
the
waves
of
the
ocean
are
merely
in
a
state
of
ebb
and
flow
there
is
nothing
new
under
the
sun
two
centuries
perhaps
after
philip
the
second
shall
be
gathered
to
his
ancestors
he
died
in
men
shall
learn
over
again
to
persecute
each
other
for
conscience
sake
other
anabaptists
or
levellers
shall
furnish
pretexts
for
new
persecutions
other
inquisitors
shall
arise
in
the
most
enlightened
tracts
of
europe
and
professors
from
their
chair
sheltering
their
intolerance
under
the
great
names
of
aristotle
and
cicero
shall
instruct
their
scholars
that
a
heterodox
doctrine
is
the
worst
of
crimes
and
that
the
philanthropy
and
purity
of
heart
in
which
it
is
maintained
only
render
its
defenders
the
more
worthy
to
be
extirpated
what
were
the
ideas
and
reflections
of
my
fellows
seated
on
the
benches
above
below
and
on
either
side
of
me
i
am
unable
to
affirm
my
own
could
not
fail
to
be
pungent
and
distressing
i
understood
continually
more
and
more
of
the
mysterious
and
unuttered
history
of
the
stranger
who
died
in
the
of
the
lake
of
constance
i
found
that
i
was
only
acting
over
again
what
he
had
experienced
before
me
his
legacies
had
served
to
involve
me
in
the
bitterest
and
most
unheard
of
miseries
but
were
wholly
destitute
of
ability
to
rescue
from
the
evils
themselves
created
unbounded
wealth
i
found
to
have
no
power
to
bribe
the
dastard
slaves
of
religious
bigotry
and
the
elixir
of
immortality
though
it
could
cure
disease
and
put
to
flight
the
approaches
of
age
was
impotent
to
repel
the
fervour
of
devouring
flames
i
might
have
been
happy
i
was
happy
when
the
stranger
found
me
i
might
have
lived
to
a
virtuous
and
venerable
old
age
and
have
died
in
the
arms
of
my
posterity
the
stranger
had
given
me
wealth
and
i
was
now
poorer
than
the
peasant
who
wanders
amidst
polar
snows
the
stranger
had
given
me
immortality
and
in
a
few
days
i
was
to
expire
in
excruciating
tortures
he
found
me
tranquil
contented
in
the
midst
of
simple
yet
inestimable
pleasures
he
breathed
into
me
the
restless
sentiment
of
ambition
and
it
was
that
sentiment
which
at
length
had
placed
me
on
high
in
the
chapel
of
the
prison
of
the
catholic
inquisition
our
progress
to
valladolid
was
slow
and
solemn
and
occupied
a
space
of
no
less
than
four
days
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
we
approached
that
city
the
king
and
his
court
came
out
to
meet
us
he
saluted
the
inquisitor
general
with
all
the
demonstrations
of
the
deepest
submission
and
humility
and
then
having
yielded
him
the
place
of
honour
turned
round
his
horse
and
accompanied
us
to
valladolid
the
cavalcade
that
attended
the
king
broke
into
two
files
and
received
us
in
the
midst
of
them
the
whole
city
seemed
to
empty
itself
on
this
memorable
occasion
and
the
multitudes
that
crowded
along
the
road
and
were
scattered
in
the
neighbouring
fields
were
innumerable
the
day
was
now
closed
and
the
procession
went
forward
amidst
the
light
of
a
thousand
torches
we
the
condemned
of
the
inquisition
had
been
conducted
from
the
metropolis
upon
tumbrils
but
as
we
arrived
at
the
gates
of
valladolid
we
were
commanded
for
the
greater
humiliation
to
alight
and
proceed
on
foot
to
the
place
of
our
confinement
as
many
as
could
not
walk
without
assistance
being
supported
by
the
attendants
we
were
neither
chained
nor
bound
the
practice
of
the
inquisition
being
to
deliver
the
condemned
upon
such
occasions
into
the
hands
of
two
sureties
each
who
placed
their
charge
in
the
middle
between
them
and
men
of
the
most
respectable
characters
were
accustomed
from
religious
motives
to
sue
for
this
melancholy
office
dejected
and
despairing
i
entered
the
streets
of
the
city
no
object
present
to
the
eyes
of
my
mind
but
that
of
my
approaching
execution
the
crowd
was
vast
the
confusion
inexpressible
as
we
passed
by
the
end
of
a
narrow
lane
the
horse
of
one
of
the
guards
who
rode
exactly
in
a
line
with
me
plunged
and
reared
in
a
violent
manner
and
at
length
threw
his
rider
upon
the
pavement
others
of
the
attempted
to
catch
the
bridle
of
the
enraged
animal
they
rushed
against
each
other
several
of
the
crowd
were
thrown
down
and
trampled
under
the
horses
feet
the
shrieks
of
these
and
the
loud
cries
and
exclamations
of
the
bystanders
mingled
in
confused
and
discordant
chorus
no
sound
no
object
could
be
distinguished
from
the
excess
of
the
tumult
a
sudden
thought
darted
into
my
mind
where
all
an
instant
before
had
been
relaxation
and
despair
two
or
three
of
the
horses
pushed
forward
in
a
particular
direction
a
moment
after
they
resiled
with
equal
violence
and
left
a
wide
but
transitory
gap
my
project
was
no
sooner
conceived
than
executed
weak
as
i
had
just
now
felt
myself
a
supernatural
tide
of
strength
seemed
to
come
over
me
i
sprung
away
with
all
imaginable
impetuosity
and
rushed
down
the
lane
i
have
just
mentioned
every
one
amidst
the
confusion
was
attentive
to
his
personal
safety
and
several
minutes
elapsed
before
i
was
missed
chapter
xxxiii
in
the
lane
every
thing
was
silent
and
the
darkness
was
extreme
man
woman
and
child
were
gone
out
to
view
the
procession
for
some
time
i
could
scarcely
distinguish
a
single
object
the
doors
and
windows
were
all
closed
i
now
chanced
to
come
to
an
open
door
within
i
saw
no
one
but
an
old
man
who
was
busy
over
some
metallic
work
at
a
of
fire
i
had
no
room
for
choice
i
expected
every
moment
to
hear
the
myrmidons
of
the
inquisition
at
my
heels
i
rushed
in
i
impetuously
closed
the
door
and
bolted
it
i
then
seized
the
old
man
by
the
collar
of
his
shirt
with
a
determined
grasp
and
swore
vehemently
that
i
would
annihilate
him
that
instant
if
he
did
not
consent
to
afford
me
assistance
though
for
some
time
i
had
perhaps
been
feebler
than
he
the
terror
that
now
drove
me
on
rendered
me
comparatively
a
giant
he
intreated
me
to
permit
him
to
breathe
and
promised
to
do
whatever
i
should
desire
i
looked
round
the
apartment
and
saw
a
rapier
hanging
against
the
wall
of
which
i
instantly
proceeded
to
make
myself
master
while
i
was
doing
this
my
involuntary
host
who
was
extremely
terrified
at
my
procedure
nimbly
attempted
to
slip
by
me
and
rush
into
the
street
with
difficulty
i
caught
hold
of
his
arm
and
pulling
him
back
put
the
point
of
my
rapier
to
his
breast
solemnly
assuring
him
that
no
consideration
on
earth
should
save
him
from
my
fury
if
he
attempted
to
escape
a
second
time
he
immediately
dropped
on
his
knees
and
with
the
most
piteous
accents
intreated
me
to
spare
his
life
i
told
him
that
i
was
no
robber
that
i
did
not
intend
him
the
slightest
harm
and
that
if
he
would
implicitly
yield
to
my
direction
he
might
assure
himself
he
never
should
have
reason
to
repent
his
compliance
by
this
declaration
the
terrors
of
the
old
man
were
somewhat
appeased
i
took
the
opportunity
of
this
calm
to
go
to
the
street
door
which
i
instantly
locked
and
put
the
key
in
my
bosom
nothing
but
the
most
fortunate
concurrence
of
circumstances
could
have
thus
forwarded
my
escape
the
rearing
of
the
horse
of
the
was
purely
accidental
the
concourse
and
press
of
the
crowd
from
all
sides
could
alone
have
rendered
this
circumstance
of
any
magnitude
the
gap
which
was
made
by
the
pushing
forwards
and
resiling
of
the
horses
continued
barely
long
enough
for
me
to
spring
through
and
closed
again
in
an
instant
it
is
astonishing
that
the
thought
of
escape
should
have
thus
suddenly
darted
into
my
mind
which
but
a
moment
before
was
in
a
state
of
dejection
equally
incompatible
with
activity
and
with
hope
that
in
the
lane
down
which
i
rushed
i
should
have
met
no
human
creature
and
that
the
first
open
door
i
saw
should
lead
to
the
residence
of
a
decrepid
old
man
who
appeared
to
be
its
single
inhabitant
were
occurrences
equally
extraordinary
yet
seem
to
have
been
both
indispensable
to
my
safety
one
point
more
concurred
with
this
fortunate
train
and
assisted
to
still
the
palpitations
of
my
beating
heart
i
perceived
by
certain
indications
in
the
countenance
of
my
host
that
he
was
by
parentage
a
jew
i
presently
concluded
that
he
was
what
in
spain
they
denominate
a
new
christian
for
that
otherwise
he
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
reside
at
large
in
a
spanish
city
but
upon
that
supposition
i
did
not
believe
that
christianity
was
very
deeply
mingled
up
in
him
with
the
vital
principle
the
converts
of
the
inquisition
are
not
conspicuous
for
their
sincerity
now
then
for
the
first
time
i
thought
in
the
course
of
twelve
years
i
had
opportunity
to
communicate
with
a
man
whose
soul
was
not
enslaved
to
the
superstition
of
this
devoted
country
all
i
had
seen
during
the
period
of
my
confinement
were
hyenas
tigers
and
crocodiles
they
were
not
men
i
had
no
sooner
soothed
my
host
into
a
temper
to
listen
to
my
story
than
i
told
him
with
all
imaginable
frankness
whence
i
came
and
to
what
i
had
been
destined
the
mention
of
sorcery
however
and
preternatural
practices
i
suppressed
for
i
suspected
that
persons
of
all
religions
entertained
an
equal
horror
against
these
i
suffered
him
to
imagine
that
the
allegation
against
me
had
been
the
crime
of
heresy
all
sects
of
the
christian
superstition
might
be
supposed
equally
obnoxious
or
acceptable
to
a
jew
i
emphatically
appealed
to
the
persecutions
which
had
been
so
long
directed
against
the
religion
of
his
ancestors
and
observed
how
disgraceful
it
would
be
in
him
to
assist
the
operation
of
a
principle
the
effects
of
which
his
fathers
had
so
deeply
deplored
and
so
perfectly
abhorred
i
assured
him
that
i
would
bring
him
into
no
danger
and
that
all
i
asked
was
the
protection
of
a
few
hours
i
would
leave
him
in
the
course
of
the
following
day
and
he
should
hear
of
me
no
more
i
reminded
him
that
the
danger
he
had
to
fear
was
in
betraying
not
in
protecting
me
the
inquisition
looked
upon
every
new
christian
with
an
eye
of
the
severest
jealousy
and
the
mere
fact
if
known
that
i
had
taken
refuge
in
his
house
would
infallibly
subject
him
to
the
purgation
of
a
temporary
imprisonment
in
their
dungeons
it
would
be
in
vain
for
him
to
affirm
that
he
had
no
choice
in
what
had
occurred
he
was
without
a
witness
to
confirm
his
relation
and
the
assertions
of
a
man
born
of
jewish
parents
never
obtained
credit
in
the
court
of
the
inquisition
i
added
with
solemn
asseverations
that
the
moment
i
set
foot
beyond
the
territory
of
spain
i
would
remit
to
him
the
sum
of
six
hundred
pistoles
as
an
acknowledgment
for
his
kindness
during
the
whole
of
my
discourse
i
watched
his
countenance
with
the
utmost
minuteness
it
gradually
relaxed
from
the
terror
which
had
at
first
appeared
in
it
to
expressions
of
compassion
and
complacence
i
saw
nothing
that
ought
to
alarm
me
when
it
was
his
turn
to
speak
he
earnestly
assured
me
that
he
took
a
warm
interest
in
my
story
and
would
cheerfully
perform
every
thing
i
required
he
was
happy
that
my
favourable
stars
had
led
me
to
his
habitation
and
would
rejoice
to
the
latest
hour
of
his
existence
if
they
rendered
him
instrumental
in
preserving
the
life
of
a
human
being
from
so
deplorable
a
catastrophe
while
i
talked
to
him
i
easily
perceived
that
the
arguments
i
used
which
produced
the
most
sensible
effect
upon
his
features
were
those
of
the
dangers
arising
to
him
from
betraying
me
and
the
reward
of
six
hundred
pistoles
which
i
promised
him
in
the
event
of
my
success
his
motives
however
were
blended
together
in
his
mind
and
he
had
no
sooner
formed
a
determination
grounded
perhaps
upon
the
meanest
considerations
than
he
became
eloquent
in
a
panegyric
of
his
own
benevolence
by
which
he
was
not
i
believe
more
anxious
to
impose
upon
me
than
to
put
the
change
upon
himself
i
considered
all
that
he
said
his
gestures
and
the
very
tones
of
his
voice
with
eager
anxiety
the
terror
of
the
inquisition
penetrated
to
the
marrow
in
my
bones
and
the
fate
awarded
against
me
by
that
court
became
inexpressibly
more
horrible
to
my
thoughts
now
that
i
saw
the
probability
of
escaping
it
every
thing
that
i
observed
in
the
jew
was
apparently
fair
plausible
and
encouraging
but
nothing
had
power
to
quell
the
agitations
of
my
apprehensive
soul
we
were
still
engaged
in
discussing
the
topics
i
have
mentioned
when
i
was
suddenly
alarmed
by
the
noise
of
some
one
stirring
in
the
inner
apartment
i
had
looked
into
this
room
and
had
perceived
nothing
but
the
bed
upon
which
the
old
man
nightly
reposed
himself
i
sprung
up
however
at
the
sound
and
perceiving
that
the
door
had
a
bolt
on
the
outside
i
eagerly
fastened
it
i
then
turned
to
mordecai
such
previously
to
his
conversion
had
been
the
name
of
my
host
wretch
said
i
did
not
you
assure
me
that
there
was
no
one
but
yourself
in
the
house
oh
cried
mordecai
it
is
my
child
it
is
my
child
she
went
into
the
inner
apartment
and
has
fallen
asleep
on
the
beware
i
answered
the
slightest
falsehood
more
shall
instantly
be
expiated
in
your
i
call
abraham
to
witness
rejoined
the
once
more
terrified
jew
it
is
my
child
only
my
child
tell
me
cried
i
with
severity
of
accent
how
old
is
this
child
only
five
years
said
mordecai
my
dear
leah
died
when
her
babe
was
no
more
than
a
year
old
and
though
we
had
several
children
this
single
one
has
survived
speak
to
your
child
let
me
hear
her
voice
he
spoke
to
her
and
she
answered
father
i
want
to
come
i
was
satisfied
it
was
the
voice
of
a
little
girl
i
turned
to
the
jew
take
care
said
i
how
you
deceive
me
now
is
there
no
other
person
in
that
room
he
imprecated
a
curse
on
himself
if
there
were
i
opened
the
door
with
caution
and
the
little
girl
came
forward
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
i
seized
her
with
a
rapid
motion
and
retired
back
to
a
chair
man
said
i
you
have
trifled
with
me
too
rashly
you
have
not
considered
what
i
am
escaped
from
and
what
i
have
to
fear
from
this
moment
this
child
shall
be
the
pledge
of
my
safety
i
will
not
part
with
her
an
instant
as
long
as
i
remain
in
your
house
and
with
this
rapier
in
my
hand
i
will
pierce
her
to
the
heart
the
moment
i
am
led
to
imagine
that
i
am
no
longer
in
the
jew
trembled
at
my
resolution
the
emotions
of
a
father
worked
in
his
features
and
glistened
in
his
eye
at
least
let
me
kiss
her
said
he
be
it
so
replied
i
one
embrace
and
then
till
the
dawn
of
the
coming
day
she
remains
with
i
released
my
hold
the
child
rushed
to
her
father
and
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
my
dear
leah
cried
mordecai
now
a
sainted
spirit
in
the
bosom
of
our
father
abraham
i
call
god
to
witness
between
us
that
if
all
my
caution
and
vigilance
can
prevent
it
not
a
hair
of
this
child
shall
be
injured
stranger
you
little
know
by
how
strong
a
motive
you
have
now
engaged
me
to
your
cause
we
poor
jews
hunted
on
the
face
of
the
earth
the
abhorrence
and
execration
of
mankind
have
nothing
but
family
affections
to
support
us
under
our
multiplied
disgraces
and
family
affections
are
entwined
with
our
existence
the
fondest
and
part
of
ourselves
the
god
of
abraham
bless
you
my
child
now
sir
speak
what
is
it
you
require
of
me
i
told
the
jew
that
i
must
have
a
suit
of
clothes
conformable
to
the
appearance
of
a
spanish
cavalier
and
certain
medical
ingredients
that
i
named
to
him
together
with
his
of
coals
to
prepare
them
and
that
done
i
would
then
impose
on
him
no
further
trouble
having
received
his
instructions
he
immediately
set
out
to
procure
what
i
demanded
he
took
with
him
the
key
of
the
house
and
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
i
retired
with
the
child
into
the
inner
apartment
and
fastened
the
door
at
first
i
applied
myself
to
tranquillise
the
child
who
had
been
somewhat
alarmed
at
what
she
had
heard
and
seen
this
was
no
very
difficult
task
she
presently
left
me
to
amuse
herself
with
some
playthings
that
lay
scattered
in
a
corner
of
the
apartment
my
heart
was
now
comparatively
at
ease
i
saw
the
powerful
hold
i
had
on
the
fidelity
of
the
jew
and
firmly
persuaded
myself
that
i
had
no
treachery
to
fear
on
his
part
thus
circumstanced
the
exertion
and
activity
with
which
i
had
lately
been
imbued
left
me
and
i
insensibly
sunk
into
a
sort
of
slumber
the
night
was
now
far
advanced
and
i
was
still
reclined
insensible
upon
mordecai
s
bed
when
suddenly
a
jargon
of
various
sounds
seemed
from
all
sides
to
assail
me
my
mind
was
confused
i
heard
something
but
seemed
wholly
unconscious
what
i
was
and
where
i
wanted
to
escape
from
the
disturbance
but
it
continued
and
even
increased
at
length
i
was
forced
to
command
my
attention
and
the
first
thing
i
perceived
was
a
beating
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
the
little
girl
was
come
to
the
bedside
and
endeavouring
to
shake
me
sir
sir
she
cried
in
an
eager
accent
my
father
wants
to
come
in
and
i
can
not
slip
the
bolt
of
the
by
slow
degrees
i
began
to
comprehend
my
situation
and
to
recollect
what
had
happened
immediately
before
i
felt
greatly
alarmed
i
feared
by
the
disturbance
that
mordecai
had
not
returned
alone
i
essayed
to
speak
my
organs
refused
their
office
i
endeavoured
to
move
my
limbs
felt
palsied
and
absolutely
lifeless
i
experienced
a
sinking
and
sickness
of
heart
that
seemed
to
be
the
immediate
precursor
of
death
by
listening
occasionally
to
the
discourse
which
the
father
and
the
daughter
began
to
hold
with
each
other
i
became
satisfied
that
mordecai
was
without
a
companion
i
endeavoured
to
make
the
little
girl
understand
that
i
was
incapable
of
rising
from
the
bed
and
having
at
length
succeeded
she
communicated
the
information
to
her
father
with
considerable
trouble
he
loosened
the
door
at
its
hinges
and
entered
the
room
i
found
myself
in
the
extremest
degree
feeble
and
languid
the
jew
however
assiduously
administered
to
me
of
cordials
he
had
in
his
possession
and
by
degrees
i
felt
myself
considerably
restored
now
for
the
first
time
i
was
at
leisure
to
attend
to
the
state
of
my
strength
and
my
health
my
confinement
in
the
inquisition
and
the
treatment
i
had
experienced
had
before
rendered
me
feeble
and
almost
helpless
but
these
appeared
to
be
circumstances
scarcely
worthy
of
attention
in
the
situation
in
which
i
was
then
placed
the
impulse
i
felt
in
the
midst
of
the
confusion
in
the
grand
street
of
valladolid
produced
in
me
an
energy
and
power
of
exertion
which
nothing
but
the
actual
experience
of
the
fact
could
have
persuaded
me
was
possible
this
energy
once
begun
appeared
to
have
the
faculty
of
prolonging
itself
and
i
did
not
relapse
into
imbecility
till
the
occasion
seemed
to
be
exhausted
which
called
for
my
exertion
i
examined
myself
by
a
mirror
with
which
mordecai
furnished
me
i
found
my
hair
as
white
as
snow
and
my
face
ploughed
with
a
thousand
furrows
i
was
now
an
age
which
with
moderate
exercise
and
a
vigorous
constitution
often
appears
like
the
prime
of
human
existence
but
whoever
had
looked
upon
me
in
my
present
condition
would
not
have
hesitated
to
affirm
that
i
had
reached
the
eightieth
year
of
my
age
i
examined
with
dispassionate
remark
the
state
of
my
intellect
i
was
persuaded
that
it
had
subsided
into
childishness
my
mind
had
been
as
much
cribbed
and
immured
as
my
body
i
was
the
mere
shadow
of
a
man
of
no
more
power
and
worth
than
that
which
a
magic
lantern
produces
upon
a
wall
these
are
thy
works
superstition
this
the
genuine
and
proper
operation
of
what
is
called
christianity
let
the
reader
judge
of
what
i
had
passed
through
and
known
within
those
cursed
walls
by
the
effects
i
have
already
refused
i
continue
to
refuse
to
tell
what
i
suffered
and
how
those
effects
were
produced
enough
of
compassion
enough
of
complaint
i
will
confine
myself
as
far
as
i
am
able
to
simple
history
being
recovered
as
far
as
the
cordials
and
attention
of
mordecai
were
capable
of
recovering
me
i
desired
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
to
be
alone
except
that
i
was
still
resolved
to
retain
the
little
jewess
as
the
pledge
of
my
safety
i
was
greatly
obliged
to
my
host
for
the
punctuality
he
had
already
displayed
he
had
found
considerable
difficulty
in
procuring
the
articles
of
which
i
stood
in
need
owing
partly
to
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
partly
to
the
presence
of
the
king
and
the
general
hurry
and
confusion
which
had
been
produced
by
the
solemn
entry
of
the
inquisition
his
efforts
too
to
recover
me
from
the
languor
and
lethargy
into
which
i
had
sunk
had
a
character
of
generosity
and
perhaps
i
ought
now
to
have
trusted
him
without
a
hostage
but
my
heart
was
too
earnestly
bent
upon
accomplishing
its
present
object
to
afford
harbour
to
the
punctilios
of
delicacy
the
same
earnestness
caused
me
to
insist
upon
mordecai
s
repairing
the
injury
which
the
hinges
of
the
door
had
sustained
and
i
was
careful
to
satisfy
myself
that
every
thing
was
restored
to
a
state
of
perfect
security
i
was
now
once
again
alone
the
little
girl
who
had
been
unusually
disturbed
and
roused
at
an
unseasonable
hour
sunk
into
a
profound
sleep
i
heard
the
noise
which
mordecai
made
in
undressing
himself
and
composing
his
limbs
upon
a
mattrass
which
he
had
dragged
for
the
present
occasion
into
the
front
room
and
spread
before
the
hearth
i
soon
found
by
the
hardness
of
his
breathing
that
he
also
was
asleep
i
unfolded
the
papers
he
had
brought
me
they
consisted
of
various
medical
ingredients
i
had
directed
him
to
procure
there
were
also
two
or
three
vials
containing
syrups
and
essences
i
had
near
me
a
pair
of
scales
with
which
to
weigh
my
ingredients
a
vessel
of
water
the
of
my
host
in
which
the
fire
was
nearly
extinguished
and
a
small
taper
with
some
charcoal
to
relight
the
fire
in
case
of
necessity
while
i
was
occupied
in
surveying
these
articles
and
arranging
my
materials
a
sort
of
torpor
came
suddenly
over
me
so
as
to
allow
me
no
time
for
resistance
i
sunk
upon
the
bed
i
remained
thus
for
about
half
an
hour
seemingly
without
the
power
of
collecting
my
thoughts
at
length
i
started
felt
alarmed
and
applied
my
utmost
force
of
mind
to
rouse
my
exertions
while
i
drove
or
attempted
to
drive
my
animal
spirits
from
limb
to
limb
and
from
part
to
part
as
if
to
enquire
into
the
general
condition
of
my
frame
i
became
convinced
that
i
was
dying
let
not
the
reader
be
surprised
at
this
twelve
years
imprisonment
in
a
narrow
and
unwholesome
cell
may
well
account
for
so
sudden
a
catastrophe
strange
and
paradoxical
as
it
may
seem
i
believe
it
will
be
found
in
the
experiment
that
the
calm
and
security
which
succeed
to
great
internal
injuries
are
more
dangerous
than
the
pangs
and
hardships
that
went
before
i
was
now
thoroughly
alarmed
i
applied
myself
with
all
vigilance
and
expedition
to
the
compounding
my
materials
the
fire
was
gone
out
the
taper
was
glimmering
in
the
socket
to
swallow
the
julep
when
i
had
prepared
it
seemed
to
be
the
last
effort
of
which
my
organs
and
muscles
were
capable
it
was
the
elixir
of
immortality
exactly
made
up
according
to
the
prescription
of
the
stranger
whether
from
the
potency
of
the
medicine
or
the
effect
of
imagination
i
felt
revived
the
moment
i
had
swallowed
it
i
placed
myself
deliberately
in
mordecai
s
bed
and
drew
over
me
the
i
fell
asleep
almost
instantly
i
believe
my
first
sleep
was
perfectly
sound
and
insensible
but
in
no
long
time
i
was
visited
with
the
pleasantest
dreams
imaginable
nothing
was
distinct
nothing
was
attended
with
the
consciousness
of
my
former
identity
but
every
thing
was
gay
cheerful
invigorating
and
delicious
i
wandered
amidst
verdant
lawns
and
gardens
i
was
saluted
with
the
singing
of
a
thousand
birds
and
the
murmuring
of
a
thousand
fountains
kids
fawns
and
lambs
frisked
and
gamboled
before
me
at
a
distance
through
an
opening
in
the
trees
i
discerned
nymphs
and
their
swains
dancing
a
variety
of
antic
measures
i
advanced
towards
them
they
approached
towards
me
fifes
oboes
recorders
and
instruments
of
a
hundred
names
commenced
a
cheerful
and
melodious
concert
myself
and
the
dancers
now
were
met
they
placed
me
in
the
midst
of
them
they
began
a
choral
song
the
motion
of
their
limbs
conformed
to
their
numbers
i
was
the
theme
of
the
general
chaunt
they
ascribed
to
me
the
beauty
of
apollo
the
strength
of
hercules
the
invention
of
mercury
and
the
youth
of
bacchus
my
sleep
was
not
long
in
a
few
hours
i
awakened
with
difficulty
i
recognised
the
objects
about
me
and
recollected
where
i
had
been
it
seemed
to
me
that
my
heart
had
never
beat
so
vigorously
nor
my
spirits
flowed
so
gay
i
was
all
elasticity
and
life
i
could
scarcely
hold
myself
quiet
i
felt
impelled
to
bound
and
leap
like
a
kid
upon
the
mountains
i
perceived
that
my
little
jewess
was
still
asleep
she
had
been
unusually
fatigued
the
night
before
i
know
not
whether
mordecai
s
hour
of
rising
were
come
if
it
were
he
was
careful
not
to
disturb
his
guest
i
put
on
the
garments
he
had
prepared
i
gazed
upon
the
mirror
he
had
left
in
my
apartment
i
can
recollect
no
sensation
in
the
course
of
my
life
so
unexpected
and
surprising
as
what
i
felt
at
that
moment
the
evening
before
i
had
seen
my
hair
white
and
my
face
ploughed
with
furrows
i
looked
fourscore
what
i
beheld
now
was
totally
different
yet
altogether
familiar
it
was
myself
myself
as
i
had
appeared
on
the
day
of
my
marriage
with
marguerite
de
damville
the
eyes
the
mouth
the
hair
the
complexion
every
circumstance
point
by
point
the
same
i
leaped
a
gulf
of
years
i
waked
from
a
dream
troublesome
and
distressful
beyond
all
description
but
it
vanished
like
the
shades
of
night
upon
the
burst
of
a
glorious
morning
in
july
and
left
not
a
trace
behind
i
knew
not
how
to
take
away
my
eyes
from
the
mirror
before
me
i
soon
began
to
consider
that
if
it
were
astonishing
to
me
that
through
all
the
regions
of
my
countenance
i
could
discover
no
trace
of
what
i
had
been
the
night
before
it
would
be
still
more
astonishing
to
my
host
this
sort
of
sensation
i
had
not
the
smallest
ambition
to
produce
one
of
the
advantages
of
the
metamorphosis
i
had
sustained
consisted
in
its
tendency
in
the
eyes
of
all
that
saw
me
to
cut
off
every
species
of
connection
between
my
present
and
my
former
self
it
fortunately
happened
that
the
room
in
which
i
slept
being
constructed
upon
the
model
of
many
others
in
spain
had
a
stair
at
the
further
end
with
a
in
the
ceiling
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
inhabitant
to
ascend
on
the
roof
in
the
cool
of
the
day
the
roofs
were
flat
and
so
constructed
that
there
was
little
difficulty
in
passing
along
them
from
house
to
house
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other
i
availed
myself
of
the
opportunity
and
took
leave
of
the
residence
of
my
land
host
in
a
way
perfectly
unceremonious
determined
however
speedily
to
transmit
to
him
the
reward
i
had
promised
it
may
easily
be
believed
that
mordecai
was
not
less
rejoiced
at
the
absence
of
a
guest
whom
the
vigilance
of
the
inquisition
rendered
an
uncommonly
dangerous
one
than
i
was
to
quit
his
habitation
i
closed
the
trap
after
me
and
clambered
from
roof
to
roof
to
a
considerable
distance
at
length
i
encountered
the
occasion
of
an
open
window
and
fortunately
descended
unseen
by
any
human
being
into
the
street
having
with
difficulty
succeeded
on
this
occasion
of
public
solemnity
in
engaging
an
apartment
in
one
of
the
hotels
of
valladolid
i
sent
into
it
as
soon
as
i
was
able
a
chest
containing
every
necessary
of
apparel
and
particularly
a
suit
of
clothes
i
then
changed
my
dress
and
threw
the
clothes
which
mordecai
had
provided
into
the
chest
i
had
purchased
as
long
as
they
continued
safely
locked
up
and
the
key
in
my
possession
no
faculty
possessed
by
any
human
creature
could
detect
my
identity
and
expose
me
afresh
to
my
former
jailors
the
only
peril
under
which
i
had
before
laboured
was
from
mordecai
who
if
he
had
seen
me
in
the
garments
he
had
procured
might
have
recognised
them
and
though
a
peril
from
this
source
came
barely
within
the
limits
of
possibility
it
was
easily
avoided
and
i
therefore
chose
to
avoid
it
i
passed
the
whole
of
this
day
in
a
species
of
enjoyment
which
as
it
has
no
parallel
in
the
ordinary
transactions
of
mankind
so
are
there
no
terms
in
the
received
languages
of
the
world
that
are
adequate
to
the
description
of
it
it
has
often
been
a
subject
of
melancholy
and
complaint
among
mortals
that
while
the
whole
vegetable
system
contains
in
it
a
principle
of
perpetual
renewal
man
alone
the
ornament
and
lord
of
the
universe
man
knows
no
return
to
youth
when
the
sun
declines
in
the
west
the
flowers
droop
and
fold
up
their
frail
and
delicate
leaves
but
soon
the
eyelids
of
the
morn
are
again
opened
and
again
they
rejoice
in
his
invigorating
beams
upon
the
approach
of
winter
the
beech
the
ash
and
the
scatter
their
withered
foliage
over
the
plains
but
spring
reappears
and
nakedness
is
no
longer
their
reproach
and
they
clothe
themselves
anew
in
their
leafy
honours
with
what
a
melancholy
sensation
does
the
old
man
survey
his
decaying
limbs
to
me
he
cries
there
is
no
second
morning
and
no
returning
spring
my
head
pressed
down
with
years
shall
never
again
erect
itself
in
conscious
manhood
these
hoary
locks
shall
no
more
be
adorned
with
the
auburn
of
glossy
youth
my
trunk
shall
at
no
time
clothe
itself
with
a
smoother
rind
a
recruited
marrow
shall
never
fill
these
bones
nor
a
more
vigorous
sap
circulate
through
my
unstrung
limbs
i
recollect
what
i
was
in
the
prime
of
manhood
with
vain
regrets
the
memory
answers
no
other
end
than
to
torment
and
upbraid
me
the
useless
wish
of
the
old
man
the
object
of
his
hopeless
sigh
was
mine
common
and
blessings
have
little
value
in
the
eye
of
their
possessor
the
young
man
squanders
the
endowments
of
youth
and
knows
not
to
prize
them
if
the
young
man
had
once
been
old
if
the
old
man
could
again
be
young
then
and
then
only
they
would
justly
estimate
their
wealth
the
springy
limb
the
bounding
frame
the
vigour
that
sets
fatigue
at
defiance
and
revels
in
pleasures
unexhausted
would
then
by
the
near
and
conscious
comparison
of
feebleness
and
lassitude
the
drooping
limb
the
aching
head
and
the
frame
decayed
in
all
its
senses
be
well
understood
such
was
my
situation
yesterday
i
was
fourscore
i
was
twenty
yesterday
i
was
a
prisoner
crippled
in
every
articulation
i
was
a
citizen
of
the
world
capable
of
all
its
delights
i
was
destined
to
have
been
dragged
to
the
stake
with
ignominy
and
to
suffer
intolerable
anguish
amidst
the
shouts
and
huzzas
of
an
unfeeling
populace
i
was
at
liberty
to
employ
as
i
pleased
to
choose
the
theatre
upon
which
it
should
be
spent
and
the
gratifications
that
should
be
crowded
into
it
what
was
most
material
my
mind
was
grown
young
with
my
body
weary
of
eternal
struggle
i
had
lately
resigned
the
contest
and
sunk
under
the
that
relentlessly
pursued
me
now
i
felt
within
me
a
superfluity
of
vigour
i
panted
for
something
to
contend
with
and
something
to
conquer
my
senses
unfolded
themselves
to
all
the
curiosity
of
remark
my
thoughts
seemed
capable
of
industry
unwearied
and
investigation
the
most
constant
and
invincible
ambition
revived
in
my
bosom
i
longed
for
new
engagements
and
new
relations
i
desired
to
perform
something
that
i
might
myself
regard
with
complacence
and
that
i
might
see
the
world
start
at
and
applaud
i
determined
for
reasons
that
i
shall
presently
have
occasion
to
unfold
that
my
first
visit
should
be
to
my
daughters
at
my
paternal
estate
of
leon
i
proposed
to
spend
two
or
three
days
in
preparations
for
this
journey
by
mere
accident
by
a
most
censurable
heedlessness
i
became
in
some
degree
a
spectator
of
the
da
in
which
i
was
destined
to
have
been
a
victim
unawares
i
had
become
entangled
in
the
crowd
and
could
with
difficulty
escape
or
even
prevent
my
being
carried
nearer
the
centre
of
the
scene
i
saw
the
galleries
and
accommodations
that
had
been
erected
for
the
spectators
i
saw
the
windows
and
roofs
of
the
houses
crowded
with
beholders
the
shrieks
of
the
sufferers
i
could
not
hear
they
were
drowned
in
the
infernal
exultations
of
the
multitude
but
what
was
worst
of
all
i
discerned
some
of
the
condemned
fixed
as
they
were
upon
small
boards
near
the
top
of
stakes
about
four
yards
high
and
therefore
greatly
above
the
heads
of
the
assembly
while
the
flames
abundantly
fed
with
faggots
and
dry
fuel
climbed
aloft
and
seemed
eager
to
embrace
their
victims
as
i
have
already
said
there
were
thirty
of
these
frames
and
if
my
eye
did
not
count
them
all
my
fancy
well
supplied
what
sense
was
unable
to
discover
the
impression
i
felt
at
that
moment
was
horrible
beyond
all
conception
i
exerted
my
strength
and
pushed
out
of
the
press
with
irresistible
vigour
if
at
that
instant
i
could
have
felt
exultation
even
in
the
consciousness
of
my
own
safety
i
should
regard
myself
as
the
most
execrable
of
monsters
chapter
xxxiv
the
first
employment
in
which
i
purposed
to
engage
my
liberty
and
youth
was
a
visit
to
my
daughters
i
now
carried
a
disguise
perpetually
about
with
me
that
would
render
my
journey
incapable
of
proving
injurious
to
them
my
daughters
were
all
that
remained
if
indeed
they
still
remained
of
my
once
idolised
family
for
twelve
years
i
had
continued
totally
ignorant
of
their
fortune
and
even
of
their
existence
part
of
the
plan
i
had
adopted
for
their
advantage
necessarily
precluded
me
from
all
correspondence
or
communication
with
them
or
any
one
near
them
that
might
satisfy
and
tranquillise
the
anxieties
of
a
father
if
it
had
been
otherwise
deprived
as
i
had
been
of
the
common
benefits
of
light
and
air
and
cast
out
from
the
society
of
mankind
i
could
have
obtained
no
intelligence
of
their
welfare
in
visiting
i
determined
not
to
make
myself
known
to
them
yet
notwithstanding
the
greatness
of
this
disadvantage
i
felt
that
one
of
the
most
exquisite
gratifications
the
earth
could
afford
me
was
to
behold
my
children
what
a
multitude
of
adventures
and
incidents
might
they
not
have
encountered
in
the
space
of
twelve
years
imagination
and
affection
dwell
impatiently
on
the
interval
nor
can
any
thing
quiet
the
conjectures
of
him
that
loves
short
of
the
most
complete
information
what
a
difference
must
twelve
years
have
produced
in
the
very
persons
and
figures
of
creatures
so
young
with
what
mingled
and
exquisite
emotions
does
the
father
contemplate
his
daughter
whom
he
left
a
child
grown
up
into
a
woman
he
sees
her
with
astonishment
and
rapture
displaying
maturer
beauties
discovering
in
her
countenance
new
traces
of
knowledge
and
sentiment
and
in
her
gesture
and
manners
a
character
finished
matronly
and
sedate
the
very
circumstance
that
i
should
visit
them
unknown
and
converse
intimately
with
them
without
being
discovered
while
it
cut
me
off
from
many
pure
and
ingenuous
pleasures
added
in
some
respects
a
new
relish
to
the
indulgence
for
it
gave
it
a
character
singular
and
perhaps
unprecedented
in
the
history
of
mankind
i
anticipated
with
eager
transport
the
hour
at
which
i
should
revisit
the
place
of
my
birth
wander
amidst
the
shades
where
my
careless
infancy
had
strayed
recognise
objects
made
sacred
to
my
heart
by
associations
with
my
venerable
mother
and
my
adorable
wife
now
illumined
with
the
presence
of
my
children
and
steal
a
joy
unsuspected
and
unknown
to
which
the
very
secrecy
with
which
it
was
ravished
would
give
a
tenfold
gust
i
embraced
the
nearest
route
by
pampeluna
and
the
pyrenees
to
the
banks
of
the
garonne
one
particular
pleasure
that
i
reaped
during
this
tour
which
the
climate
and
scenery
might
alone
have
rendered
delightful
consisted
in
the
youthful
sensation
with
which
every
thing
i
saw
was
enjoyed
every
one
who
can
call
to
mind
the
amusements
of
his
childhood
will
be
conscious
that
during
that
period
all
his
senses
were
in
a
tone
adapted
to
convey
the
most
exquisite
gratification
this
is
not
merely
as
is
vulgarly
supposed
the
result
of
the
novelty
and
freshness
with
which
at
that
time
every
thing
strikes
us
the
extremities
of
the
nerves
are
in
a
state
of
the
most
delicate
susceptibility
upon
which
no
touch
however
slight
and
evanescent
is
lost
and
which
makes
us
upon
every
occasion
favourable
to
enjoyment
gasp
and
tremble
with
the
pleasure
we
imbibe
we
feel
it
thrilling
through
every
pulse
and
communicating
its
tone
to
every
part
our
attention
is
engrossed
by
a
single
object
or
if
we
are
sensible
to
accompanying
incidents
it
spreads
over
them
an
animating
sunshine
and
totally
varies
their
appearance
and
hue
age
on
the
contrary
imperceptibly
brings
along
with
it
callosity
and
sluggishness
of
sensation
our
gratifications
are
coldly
relished
and
our
desires
feebly
awakened
such
is
the
difference
in
our
perception
of
delicious
fruits
of
fragrant
smells
of
smooth
and
glossy
surfaces
of
the
vividness
of
colour
and
the
heavenly
sweetness
of
sound
if
this
be
a
just
account
i
leave
the
reader
to
imagine
how
i
enjoyed
my
tour
from
valladolid
to
the
beautiful
and
romantic
retirement
of
leon
there
was
however
one
sentiment
with
which
i
was
at
this
time
impressed
that
i
shall
find
it
difficult
to
make
the
reader
understand
in
the
extent
in
which
i
felt
it
and
that
formed
a
powerful
drawback
upon
the
pleasures
i
have
just
described
a
short
time
ago
i
had
been
old
now
i
was
young
i
had
quaffed
of
the
elixir
of
immortality
the
revolution
this
had
produced
in
my
sentiments
was
not
less
memorable
than
that
which
it
had
effected
in
my
corporeal
lineaments
and
my
mental
elasticity
it
is
so
different
a
thing
to
conceive
a
proposition
theoretically
and
to
experience
it
in
practice
the
case
is
parallel
to
that
of
the
expectation
which
an
ordinary
christian
entertains
of
eternal
bliss
it
is
an
article
in
his
creed
he
repeats
it
every
night
when
he
lies
down
and
every
morning
when
he
rises
he
would
be
both
offended
and
surprised
if
you
told
him
he
was
not
persuaded
of
it
and
yet
how
faint
and
indistinct
a
picture
it
produces
in
his
intellectual
retina
the
affairs
of
the
world
strike
him
with
all
the
force
of
vision
to
them
he
can
not
make
himself
a
stranger
and
a
pilgrim
he
can
not
transfer
all
his
affections
to
the
mere
creature
of
his
imagination
engendered
in
solitude
and
nurtured
by
enthusiasm
heaven
how
different
must
have
been
the
feelings
of
the
celebrated
apostle
who
had
been
taken
up
into
the
third
heaven
and
had
beheld
the
new
jerusalem
with
all
its
jaspers
its
chrysolites
its
emeralds
and
its
sapphires
my
situation
was
similar
to
this
i
had
long
known
as
far
as
reflection
could
assure
me
of
it
that
i
possessed
the
elixir
of
immortality
but
never
till
now
had
i
felt
the
julep
tingling
in
my
veins
and
known
the
effects
of
it
in
every
joint
and
articulation
of
my
frame
i
before
believed
i
now
felt
that
i
was
immortal
the
consequence
of
this
intimate
persuasion
was
not
without
its
portion
of
melancholy
i
still
bore
the
figure
and
lineaments
of
a
human
creature
but
i
knew
that
i
was
not
what
i
seemed
there
was
a
greater
distance
between
me
and
the
best
constructed
and
most
consummate
of
the
human
species
than
there
is
between
him
and
an
ant
or
a
muskito
crushed
by
the
first
accidental
tread
or
consumed
by
the
first
spark
wafted
by
the
wind
i
can
no
longer
cheat
my
fancy
i
know
that
i
am
alone
the
creature
does
not
exist
with
whom
i
have
any
common
language
or
any
genuine
sympathies
society
is
a
bitter
and
galling
mockery
to
my
heart
it
only
shows
in
more
glaring
colours
my
desolate
condition
the
nearer
i
attempt
to
draw
any
of
the
nominal
ties
of
our
nature
the
more
they
start
and
shrink
from
my
grasp
from
this
moment
i
could
not
shake
off
the
terrible
impression
of
my
loneliness
no
not
for
an
hour
often
does
this
impression
induce
me
to
regard
my
immortality
with
loathing
indescribable
often
do
i
wish
to
shelter
myself
from
it
in
the
sweet
oblivion
of
the
grave
from
this
hour
i
had
no
passions
no
interests
no
affections
my
heart
has
never
expanded
with
one
natural
emotion
i
have
never
delivered
myself
up
to
the
repose
of
one
genuine
amusement
if
at
any
time
i
have
had
a
glimpse
of
pleasure
it
has
irritated
only
to
deceive
it
has
increased
the
appetite
while
it
displayed
in
stronger
colours
my
impotence
to
gratify
it
what
is
worse
every
added
year
has
still
subtracted
something
from
the
little
poignancy
and
relish
which
the
bowl
of
human
life
continued
to
retain
i
have
the
power
of
assuming
a
youthful
and
glossy
appearance
whenever
i
think
proper
but
this
is
only
a
bitter
mockery
of
the
furrows
ploughed
in
my
heart
in
so
much
of
my
adventures
as
remains
for
me
to
describe
i
feel
that
i
shall
be
obliged
to
employ
the
established
terms
of
human
description
i
can
not
interrupt
the
history
of
my
sensations
by
a
recital
of
those
pangs
by
which
they
have
been
every
moment
interrupted
the
terms
i
must
use
may
delude
the
reader
into
an
imagination
that
i
still
participate
of
enjoyment
and
of
hope
be
it
so
they
may
cheat
the
reader
they
can
not
cheat
myself
previously
to
my
arrival
in
the
vicinity
of
the
garonne
i
equipped
myself
in
the
habit
of
an
armenian
and
assumed
the
character
of
a
merchant
travelling
from
country
to
country
for
the
sale
of
his
commodities
it
was
in
the
close
of
a
wintry
day
in
the
bleak
and
cheerless
month
of
december
that
i
first
viewed
from
a
distance
the
turrets
of
leon
i
procured
myself
accommodations
for
the
night
in
the
adjoining
village
being
now
after
so
long
an
absence
within
reach
of
the
residence
of
these
lovely
treasures
i
sought
without
any
direct
consciousness
of
the
sentiment
to
delay
our
interview
when
i
entered
the
little
sheltered
under
a
small
plantation
of
olives
i
dreaded
to
hear
the
repetition
of
my
family
name
i
longed
most
fervently
to
be
informed
of
the
welfare
of
my
daughters
yet
i
could
have
died
sooner
than
utter
a
single
question
on
the
subject
i
found
that
that
ardent
love
which
had
urged
me
with
rapid
steps
from
valladolid
to
leon
gradually
as
the
distance
grew
little
changed
from
an
impetuous
vehemence
to
hear
of
and
to
see
them
to
fearful
motionless
anxiety
their
light
and
airy
figures
as
i
last
saw
them
at
montauban
in
danced
before
the
eyes
of
my
imagination
what
casualties
what
calamities
might
not
have
overtaken
them
since
i
was
afraid
almost
to
breathe
lest
i
should
dissolve
the
unreal
scene
that
played
around
me
how
did
i
know
that
i
did
not
indulge
this
cheerful
imagination
for
the
last
time
again
and
again
in
the
course
of
the
evening
i
felt
as
if
i
could
have
wasted
ages
in
this
and
the
neighbouring
fields
still
believing
that
my
daughters
inhabited
yonder
towers
still
hovering
round
their
fancied
residence
but
never
daring
to
utter
their
name
lest
it
should
be
found
the
prelude
to
some
fatal
intelligence
how
rich
and
refined
a
repast
in
some
cases
is
uncertainty
it
had
the
power
to
impart
to
these
precious
pledges
a
share
of
that
immortality
of
which
i
was
the
destined
monopolist
why
had
i
not
the
courage
never
to
overpass
the
limit
at
which
i
was
now
arrived
and
wherever
i
afterwards
wandered
on
the
various
surface
of
the
globe
still
to
be
able
to
repeat
to
myself
the
complacent
whisper
i
have
visited
my
daughters
in
their
separated
abode
and
my
visit
was
productive
of
none
but
agreeable
sensations
my
passions
were
too
much
afloat
to
suffer
me
really
to
rest
in
this
patient
contemplative
gratification
before
the
morning
s
dawn
i
walked
forth
and
turned
my
eyes
towards
the
castle
i
loitered
from
bank
to
bank
and
from
point
to
point
daylight
slowly
broke
in
upon
me
but
all
was
silent
and
quiet
in
my
paternal
château
the
family
is
not
yet
stirring
said
i
to
myself
i
turned
my
steps
to
the
spot
where
the
ashes
of
my
mother
were
mingled
with
their
parent
earth
the
time
that
had
intervened
since
her
decease
the
various
fortunes
and
impressions
i
had
experienced
had
somewhat
obliterated
the
vividness
of
her
picture
in
my
memory
and
deadened
the
tremblingness
of
sensation
with
which
i
once
thought
of
her
yet
enough
was
left
to
make
it
an
interesting
moment
to
me
when
i
kneeled
at
her
tomb
why
oh
why
as
it
had
been
with
my
great
forefathers
was
it
not
a
moment
of
exultation
to
me
when
i
thus
feelingly
saluted
the
shade
of
a
parent
he
that
exults
in
such
an
hour
must
feel
that
he
has
illustrated
his
birth
and
honoured
his
progenitors
i
had
done
nothing
of
this
i
was
an
exile
on
the
face
of
the
earth
had
acquired
no
trophies
and
accumulated
no
fame
i
had
none
to
honour
none
even
to
know
me
i
had
no
family
i
had
no
friend
these
bitter
recollections
started
up
in
array
before
me
and
cut
me
to
the
heart
the
spirit
of
my
mother
frowned
upon
her
son
and
i
returned
along
the
path
by
which
i
came
disgraced
and
disconsolate
i
am
now
said
i
in
a
fit
temper
to
learn
intelligence
of
my
daughters
if
they
have
been
unhappy
to
hear
it
will
not
make
me
more
forlorn
if
they
have
been
fortunate
that
knowledge
and
that
alone
may
revive
my
i
hastened
towards
the
avenue
i
looked
into
the
thickets
and
winding
paths
as
i
passed
they
communicated
to
me
mingled
pictures
of
my
own
boyish
days
and
of
the
amusements
of
the
present
inhabitants
i
told
the
nature
of
my
pretended
traffic
to
the
servants
of
the
house
and
proposed
an
exhibition
of
my
commodities
i
was
admitted
as
i
desired
to
the
apartment
of
their
mistresses
i
saw
two
young
ladies
who
appeared
to
be
respectively
about
and
years
of
age
and
whom
without
much
difficulty
i
recognised
for
my
daughters
louisa
and
marguerite
their
situation
and
their
ages
identified
them
and
when
afterwards
i
came
to
peruse
their
features
attentively
i
could
easily
discover
traits
of
the
amiable
young
woman
and
the
playful
child
they
had
been
when
last
we
parted
i
found
them
employed
upon
a
piece
of
embroidery
a
comely
and
respectable
looking
young
woman
a
servant
was
sewing
in
another
part
of
the
room
every
thing
about
the
ladies
bespoke
the
ease
of
their
circumstances
and
the
propriety
of
their
sentiments
both
had
on
an
elegant
both
had
an
air
of
sedateness
and
sobriety
that
to
my
apprehension
told
that
they
had
not
lived
unchastened
by
misfortune
they
each
slightly
looked
up
as
i
was
ushered
into
the
apartment
they
saluted
me
with
a
graceful
and
condescending
bend
of
the
head
such
as
we
are
accustomed
to
use
to
an
inferior
whom
we
are
willing
to
put
at
his
ease
what
were
my
sensations
a
father
disguised
and
unknown
in
the
presence
of
his
children
i
attempted
to
stand
as
is
usual
for
a
tradesman
when
he
waits
on
his
customers
at
their
own
house
i
attempted
to
speak
my
tongue
refused
its
office
my
legs
tottered
as
if
sustaining
an
unusual
weight
louisa
observed
me
and
desired
me
to
be
seated
i
had
no
power
of
choice
i
accepted
her
civility
no
sooner
was
i
seated
than
in
spite
of
myself
a
flood
of
tears
gushed
from
my
eyes
she
was
astonished
she
begged
to
know
if
i
were
indisposed
she
requested
me
to
make
use
of
every
assistance
the
house
could
afford
i
now
found
my
speech
i
apologised
for
my
behaviour
said
i
had
felt
suddenly
ill
but
that
the
tears
i
shed
would
prove
the
most
effectual
relief
to
me
my
appearance
it
may
be
proper
to
mention
was
not
that
of
a
vulgar
pedlar
it
was
tall
graceful
and
ingenuous
with
a
certain
air
of
refinement
and
politeness
my
armenian
dress
though
formed
of
uncostly
materials
was
such
as
to
display
my
person
to
considerable
advantage
both
the
young
ladies
showed
themselves
interested
in
the
symptoms
of
my
distress
after
a
few
minutes
internal
struggle
i
rose
made
an
excuse
for
the
abruptness
of
my
departure
and
requested
permission
to
repeat
my
visit
in
the
afternoon
when
i
should
have
something
not
unimportant
to
communicate
to
them
i
had
seen
two
of
my
daughters
i
had
been
satisfied
that
they
still
existed
i
had
witnessed
their
exterior
health
and
beauty
as
i
withdrew
i
laid
my
hand
upon
my
heart
and
congratulated
myself
thus
far
said
i
it
is
well
i
felt
relieved
from
part
of
the
weight
that
lay
there
with
my
right
hand
i
struck
upon
my
forehead
but
oh
where
cried
i
is
my
other
daughter
the
thought
came
over
me
with
the
force
of
a
demonstration
she
is
dead
a
servant
was
attending
me
to
the
door
i
requested
to
speak
to
the
housekeeper
i
was
introduced
to
mariana
chabot
she
was
struck
with
my
appearance
as
i
believe
my
daughters
had
been
as
if
my
features
were
those
of
some
person
with
whom
she
was
intimately
acquainted
she
would
probably
have
mistaken
me
for
my
own
son
but
that
i
looked
considerably
too
young
i
intreated
her
to
pardon
my
curiosity
but
i
assured
her
i
had
a
particular
reason
to
interest
myself
in
the
family
of
monsieur
leon
and
i
therefore
requested
that
she
would
have
the
goodness
to
inform
me
of
their
affairs
as
far
as
she
could
with
propriety
communicate
them
to
a
person
who
was
not
so
happy
as
to
be
in
the
catalogue
of
their
acquaintance
i
told
her
that
i
had
just
seen
two
of
her
ladies
but
that
i
had
understood
there
had
been
three
and
i
particularly
desired
some
information
as
to
the
young
lady
who
had
not
made
her
appearance
in
the
parlour
my
presentiment
was
true
the
impression
that
smote
me
when
i
left
the
parlour
was
her
funeral
knell
my
beloved
julia
was
dead
she
had
been
dead
four
years
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
agitation
of
my
mind
when
i
visited
the
tomb
of
my
venerable
parent
i
should
have
discovered
her
monument
near
that
of
her
grandmother
that
would
have
been
too
overwhelming
a
mode
of
learning
the
painful
intelligence
i
was
glad
at
least
to
have
escaped
that
in
this
and
some
subsequent
conversations
i
held
with
this
respectable
matron
i
learned
a
variety
of
particulars
respecting
my
daughters
madame
chabot
expressed
herself
sorry
that
she
had
nothing
pleasing
to
communicate
her
young
ladies
had
been
pursued
by
a
train
of
misfortunes
though
heaven
knew
they
had
merited
every
happiness
a
few
years
after
they
had
been
settled
at
leon
julia
had
been
addressed
by
a
lover
in
every
sense
worthy
of
her
he
was
rich
noble
of
a
gallant
spirit
of
a
cultivated
understanding
and
a
truly
kind
and
affectionate
heart
their
attachment
had
been
long
and
tried
habit
and
experience
of
each
other
s
virtues
had
caused
it
to
take
a
deep
root
the
father
of
the
young
man
had
destined
him
to
marry
the
daughter
of
a
duke
and
peer
of
the
kingdom
but
finding
his
affections
unalterably
fixed
he
had
at
length
yielded
and
sanctioned
their
mutual
passion
with
his
consent
every
thing
was
now
prepared
for
the
nuptials
a
day
was
fixed
and
the
appointed
time
was
fast
approaching
just
at
this
juncture
the
father
changed
his
mind
and
became
more
obstinate
and
inexorable
than
ever
a
report
had
begun
to
be
circulated
that
monsieur
leon
the
father
of
the
young
ladies
was
still
alive
madame
chabot
expressed
her
fear
that
this
report
had
originated
in
some
indiscretion
of
bernardin
who
however
had
always
proved
himself
a
most
zealous
and
faithful
servant
and
who
had
since
paid
the
debt
of
nature
be
that
as
it
might
the
father
of
the
lover
of
julia
was
found
no
longer
accessible
to
expostulation
or
entreaty
he
was
of
an
avaricious
disposition
and
he
regarded
the
fortune
of
the
young
lady
which
would
otherwise
have
been
considerable
as
entirely
alienated
and
annihilated
by
this
flaw
in
the
title
but
what
was
more
material
it
by
no
means
accorded
with
his
ideas
of
nobility
and
honour
that
the
of
his
only
son
should
be
a
fugitive
and
a
wanderer
with
whose
residence
no
one
was
acquainted
and
of
whom
no
one
could
tell
whether
he
were
living
or
dead
the
manner
in
which
the
ladies
had
entered
into
the
repossession
of
their
paternal
estate
when
minutely
investigated
was
thought
to
have
something
in
it
of
an
ambiguous
and
unpleasant
nature
it
was
well
known
that
monsieur
leon
had
left
the
country
in
consequence
of
his
having
ruined
himself
by
the
vice
of
gaming
surely
said
some
it
is
a
little
mysterious
how
his
children
came
after
an
interval
of
nine
years
to
be
able
to
repurchase
all
he
ever
in
short
the
more
the
old
vicomte
was
reasoned
with
the
more
furious
he
grew
at
length
he
made
use
of
the
power
which
the
government
of
france
vests
in
the
father
of
a
family
and
shut
up
his
son
in
one
of
the
royal
prisons
this
was
a
fatal
blow
both
to
the
chevalier
and
his
mistress
disappointed
in
the
object
of
his
warmest
affections
maltreated
and
disgraced
by
the
severity
of
a
father
his
health
sensibly
declined
nothing
however
could
shake
the
inflexibility
of
the
vicomte
he
would
release
his
son
upon
no
other
terms
than
a
renunciation
of
his
love
terms
which
the
sense
of
dignity
and
honour
in
the
young
gentleman
equally
with
his
passion
forbade
him
to
accept
to
all
representations
of
the
necessity
of
granting
liberty
to
his
son
if
he
would
not
make
himself
answerable
for
his
death
the
vicomte
sternly
replied
that
he
preferred
his
dying
to
the
idea
of
his
connecting
himself
with
a
family
of
it
was
not
till
a
few
weeks
before
he
expired
that
the
father
had
consented
to
his
release
from
prison
and
had
removed
him
to
one
of
his
castles
in
a
remote
province
but
the
malady
of
the
chevalier
was
found
incurable
the
vital
principles
of
the
system
were
fatally
deranged
the
lover
died
and
the
consequences
of
this
unhappy
affair
had
put
a
premature
close
to
the
existence
of
the
unfortunate
julia
madame
chabot
added
that
the
circumstance
of
this
story
having
become
a
subject
of
public
animadversion
it
had
had
a
most
unfavourable
effect
on
the
prospects
of
the
surviving
sisters
they
bore
their
situation
with
dignity
but
they
could
not
but
feel
the
unhappy
coincidence
which
cut
them
off
from
the
happiest
condition
of
human
life
an
honourable
and
well
assorted
settlement
in
marriage
while
madame
chabot
related
to
me
the
tragical
history
of
julia
i
felt
convulsed
with
passion
and
more
than
once
burst
into
an
agony
of
tears
fatal
legacy
atrocious
secrets
of
medicine
and
chemistry
every
day
opened
to
my
astonished
and
terrified
sight
a
wider
prospect
of
their
wasteful
effects
a
common
degree
of
penetration
might
have
shown
me
that
secrets
of
this
character
cut
off
their
possessor
from
the
dearest
ties
of
human
existence
and
render
him
a
solitary
cold
individual
his
heart
no
longer
able
to
pour
itself
into
the
bosom
of
a
mistress
or
a
friend
his
bosom
no
longer
qualified
to
receive
upon
equal
terms
the
overflowing
of
a
kindred
heart
but
no
mere
exercise
of
imagination
nothing
short
of
the
actual
experience
through
which
i
had
passed
could
have
adequately
represented
the
mischiefs
of
a
thousand
various
names
that
issued
from
this
pandora
s
box
this
extract
of
a
universal
panacea
i
regarded
myself
as
the
murderer
of
these
two
lovers
than
whom
i
concluded
from
my
personal
observation
of
the
one
and
all
that
i
heard
of
the
other
two
purer
and
more
affectionate
beings
more
singularly
qualified
to
form
each
other
s
happiness
had
never
existed
i
felt
as
truly
haunted
with
the
ghosts
of
those
i
had
murdered
as
nero
or
caligula
might
have
been
my
wife
my
son
my
faithful
negro
and
now
in
addition
to
these
the
tender
julia
and
her
unalterable
admirer
i
possessed
the
gift
of
immortal
life
but
i
looked
on
myself
as
a
monster
that
did
not
deserve
to
exist
it
is
with
difficulty
that
i
shall
be
able
to
make
the
reader
understand
how
much
more
severe
the
impression
of
this
last
catastrophe
was
made
to
me
by
the
place
and
time
in
which
i
received
the
intelligence
we
are
creatures
of
sensation
our
worst
calamities
derive
as
much
of
their
pungency
from
the
accessories
by
which
they
are
accompanied
as
they
do
from
their
intrinsic
evil
if
i
had
heard
this
story
at
any
other
period
i
am
persuaded
its
effects
would
not
have
been
half
so
painful
the
idea
of
my
daughters
was
faded
in
my
sensorium
and
whatever
related
to
them
though
really
felt
and
felt
like
a
father
would
have
been
felt
with
a
less
overpowering
interest
but
now
i
had
journeyed
from
valladolid
to
the
garonne
to
behold
them
i
had
surveyed
the
castle
they
inhabited
i
had
viewed
the
garden
which
they
arranged
with
their
hands
i
had
entered
the
parlour
which
they
adorned
with
their
presence
all
this
controlled
the
operation
of
absence
and
of
distance
i
felt
at
this
moment
as
if
i
had
been
accustomed
to
see
them
every
day
and
to
regard
them
as
inseparable
from
my
existence
i
experienced
as
it
were
the
united
effect
of
familiarity
and
novelty
i
felt
the
melancholy
fate
of
julia
with
all
the
keenness
of
an
inmate
and
all
the
surprise
of
a
long
absent
traveller
the
very
metamorphosis
i
had
undergone
gave
new
poignancy
to
my
distress
madame
chabot
tortured
me
deliberately
and
at
leisure
without
the
slightest
consciousness
of
what
she
was
doing
she
believed
she
was
pouring
a
tale
of
persons
unknown
into
the
ears
of
a
native
of
the
other
hemisphere
at
the
moment
that
she
was
calling
up
in
arms
the
strongest
and
most
excruciating
feelings
of
a
father
for
his
child
i
on
the
other
hand
had
the
most
violent
struggle
with
myself
while
i
endeavoured
to
suppress
the
appearances
of
an
emotion
which
to
the
person
who
witnessed
them
must
have
been
for
ever
unaccountable
as
it
was
and
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
madame
chabot
betrayed
no
little
amazement
at
the
agitation
with
which
i
listened
to
a
story
in
which
as
she
apprehended
i
could
have
no
personal
interest
what
i
heard
from
madame
chabot
suggested
to
me
a
conduct
which
i
resolved
to
adopt
under
the
present
circumstances
in
my
next
interview
i
told
louisa
that
i
would
now
account
to
her
for
emotions
which
at
the
time
they
occurred
must
have
appeared
somewhat
extraordinary
i
owned
that
i
had
been
acquainted
with
her
father
i
said
that
i
had
first
met
with
him
in
a
journey
in
which
i
was
then
engaged
through
the
province
of
mesopotamia
that
i
had
received
from
him
though
a
stranger
a
singular
obligation
that
a
sincere
friendship
between
us
had
been
the
result
of
this
event
that
he
died
about
two
years
since
that
i
had
attended
him
in
his
last
moments
that
he
had
charged
me
with
his
dying
recommendations
and
requests
and
that
my
present
journey
into
france
had
principally
been
instigated
by
a
desire
to
visit
his
children
i
then
delivered
into
her
hands
various
letters
and
papers
which
i
had
counterfeited
chiefly
with
the
intention
of
supplying
my
daughters
with
legal
evidence
of
the
decease
of
their
father
louisa
listened
to
what
i
related
with
those
marks
of
affection
and
sorrow
which
are
inseparable
from
the
habits
of
a
well
constituted
mind
the
emotion
she
discovered
led
me
farther
than
i
first
intended
i
was
urged
by
an
irresistible
impulse
to
practise
beyond
what
the
occasion
demanded
upon
the
feelings
of
her
virtuous
mind
i
know
not
whether
this
is
to
be
considered
as
a
vain
refinement
and
a
criminal
curiosity
but
i
think
every
generous
spirit
will
excuse
me
when
it
is
recollected
that
this
covert
and
imperfect
proceeding
was
all
that
was
left
me
to
soothe
the
impatient
cravings
of
a
father
s
heart
from
time
to
time
i
reminded
her
of
particulars
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
any
one
but
her
father
should
know
i
conjured
up
past
scenes
i
made
all
the
revolutions
of
her
youth
pass
successively
in
review
before
her
i
touched
all
the
pulses
of
her
soul
sometimes
she
was
fixed
in
mute
astonishment
at
the
exactness
of
my
information
and
was
ready
to
do
me
homage
as
some
aerial
genius
who
condescended
to
clothe
himself
in
this
earthly
figure
at
other
times
astonishment
was
swallowed
up
in
feeling
her
soul
dissolved
in
tenderness
and
she
appeared
ready
to
faint
into
my
arms
it
is
scarcely
possible
to
depict
the
pleasurable
sensations
i
drew
from
these
intercourses
i
know
not
whether
they
were
entirely
innocent
but
this
i
know
that
in
me
they
produced
a
sentiment
of
innocence
and
a
sentiment
of
paradise
i
felt
sometimes
as
if
i
could
have
wasted
ages
in
this
sort
of
gratification
as
the
executor
of
their
father
my
daughters
received
me
with
every
mark
of
respect
but
after
having
already
protracted
my
visit
to
them
for
the
space
of
many
days
i
felt
that
i
should
be
guilty
of
something
alike
hostile
to
their
decorum
and
reputation
if
i
did
not
speedily
bring
it
to
a
termination
i
was
a
person
unknown
and
almost
without
a
name
nor
could
it
be
proper
for
a
young
woman
to
continue
to
receive
the
visits
of
a
person
of
her
own
age
and
a
different
sex
upon
the
intimate
and
confidential
footing
upon
which
my
visits
were
paid
except
in
the
case
of
him
whom
she
intends
to
make
her
husband
to
considerations
of
this
sort
i
was
obliged
to
sacrifice
the
gratifications
in
which
i
had
lately
been
indulging
my
principal
concern
at
leon
from
the
time
in
which
madame
chabot
had
communicated
to
me
the
real
nature
of
my
daughter
s
situation
was
to
remove
those
disadvantages
in
which
my
destiny
and
my
errors
had
involved
them
it
would
therefore
have
been
the
extreme
of
inconsistency
in
me
while
i
was
healing
one
mischief
to
prepare
for
them
another
it
is
not
indeed
probable
that
i
should
long
have
been
contented
for
myself
with
this
anomalous
and
neutral
situation
in
which
i
more
resembled
a
piece
of
furniture
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
noting
the
sensations
of
those
around
me
than
the
member
of
any
human
society
it
was
high
time
as
i
thought
even
in
this
point
of
view
that
i
should
put
an
end
to
the
inglorious
scene
should
appear
in
some
real
character
and
engage
in
some
real
undertaking
influenced
by
these
considerations
i
now
quitted
the
residence
of
my
daughters
i
had
satisfied
the
longing
curiosity
of
a
father
had
seen
their
situation
had
witnessed
their
beauty
their
accomplishments
and
their
virtues
if
i
had
been
afflicted
at
hearing
of
the
premature
fate
of
my
eldest
daughter
if
i
had
been
agonised
by
the
reflection
that
i
might
justly
regard
myself
as
her
murderer
who
was
so
fitted
to
suffer
this
anguish
as
myself
the
outcast
of
my
species
what
right
had
i
to
expect
to
be
happy
in
my
own
person
or
prosperous
in
any
of
my
relations
the
guilty
cause
of
all
this
mischief
it
was
but
suitable
that
it
should
be
brought
home
to
my
own
bosom
that
it
should
tear
and
distract
my
own
brain
add
to
this
i
was
not
without
a
hope
that
my
journey
would
not
be
found
useless
to
the
survivors
by
furnishing
to
them
the
proper
documents
to
certify
the
death
of
their
father
i
flattered
myself
that
i
had
cut
them
off
more
effectually
than
before
from
all
connection
with
my
unpropitious
destiny
and
had
placed
them
nearly
upon
a
footing
with
the
other
noble
and
unmarried
heiresses
of
their
native
country
i
have
nothing
further
to
relate
in
regard
to
these
two
amiable
and
excellent
sisters
from
the
time
that
i
quitted
leon
upon
this
occasion
to
the
time
in
which
i
am
now
writing
the
opportunity
of
making
further
enquiries
respecting
them
has
not
occurred
to
me
if
ever
it
does
occur
i
have
only
this
one
wish
to
entertain
which
if
granted
will
i
am
sure
satisfy
my
fondest
hopes
may
i
find
they
have
been
as
happy
as
they
so
well
deserve
to
be
the
parting
between
me
and
my
daughters
was
not
an
unaffecting
one
on
my
part
whose
bosom
was
fraught
with
a
thousand
tender
feelings
to
which
i
could
give
no
language
and
of
which
those
whom
they
principally
concerned
had
not
the
slightest
suspicion
it
could
not
be
unaffecting
nor
did
louisa
and
her
younger
sister
look
with
an
indifferent
eye
upon
the
bearer
of
the
last
sentiments
of
their
father
the
witness
of
his
death
the
executor
of
his
will
there
was
something
in
the
features
of
my
countenance
a
peculiar
sort
of
conformation
a
family
resemblance
to
themselves
which
it
is
probable
they
did
not
advert
to
but
which
i
am
persuaded
wrought
within
them
to
the
full
extent
of
the
mysterious
sympathies
of
our
nature
i
pretended
to
have
been
the
familiar
confident
of
their
father
i
told
them
of
things
at
which
they
started
and
almost
blushed
to
think
that
any
one
beyond
the
circuit
of
their
dearest
relations
should
have
been
privy
in
the
hour
of
our
separation
they
shed
many
tears
and
embraced
me
with
a
warmth
that
might
have
well
become
sisters
to
a
brother
yet
shall
i
confess
my
weakness
a
weakness
in
which
i
do
not
apprehend
myself
to
be
singular
it
happens
to
few
men
to
witness
the
manner
in
which
the
story
of
their
own
deaths
is
received
if
it
did
i
believe
we
all
of
us
have
enough
of
vanity
and
personal
feeling
however
sincere
a
grief
might
show
itself
in
the
demeanour
of
survivors
to
find
it
falling
short
of
our
appetites
and
demand
this
i
know
i
was
myself
a
party
to
this
unreasonableness
my
daughters
received
the
intelligence
of
my
death
with
a
decorum
and
sensibility
which
in
the
eyes
of
every
impartial
spectator
would
have
reflected
honour
on
their
characters
a
sensibility
beyond
what
could
have
been
imagined
in
daughters
who
now
had
not
seen
their
father
for
twelve
years
yet
it
was
an
unpleasing
reflection
to
me
thus
to
have
occasion
to
gauge
their
love
and
to
say
this
is
the
exact
measure
of
their
affection
i
remained
in
this
part
of
the
world
long
enough
to
see
my
children
consoled
and
myself
forgotten
of
man
upon
how
slight
a
basis
do
thy
gigantic
erections
repose
chapter
xxxv
from
leon
i
proceeded
to
the
kingdom
of
hungary
to
complete
this
journey
i
must
pass
through
near
twenty
degrees
of
longitude
but
that
was
a
trivial
consideration
what
i
most
desired
was
to
gain
a
new
situation
and
enter
upon
an
untried
scene
i
had
determined
in
my
next
experiment
upon
the
endowments
of
the
stranger
to
make
no
efforts
and
to
suffer
no
mischiefs
that
drew
their
source
from
my
own
irresolution
i
determined
as
i
have
said
to
forestall
all
opposition
by
my
firmness
and
to
silence
all
objectors
by
the
display
of
a
more
than
princely
magnificence
i
thought
it
therefore
eligible
to
remove
to
a
scene
where
no
encounter
with
any
one
i
had
ever
known
might
abash
me
and
no
relation
of
any
adventure
i
had
ever
met
should
follow
me
the
change
of
my
figure
it
is
true
would
render
an
encounter
of
this
sort
of
little
moment
to
my
liberty
or
my
reputation
but
i
was
a
new
man
and
i
was
desirous
to
engross
and
to
feel
the
benefits
that
attend
upon
novelty
there
was
another
motive
however
secretly
working
at
my
heart
of
a
grander
and
more
exalted
cast
that
made
me
prefer
hungary
to
all
the
countries
of
the
earth
hungary
had
been
now
for
upwards
of
a
century
the
great
frontier
of
the
christian
world
the
theatre
upon
which
the
followers
of
mahomet
contended
against
the
followers
of
jesus
for
destruction
and
for
empire
my
mind
had
from
time
to
time
brooded
over
this
picture
in
the
solitude
and
forlornness
of
my
dungeon
i
ruminated
on
all
the
calamities
of
hungary
from
the
battle
of
warna
in
to
the
battle
of
mohacz
in
in
both
of
which
this
generous
nation
had
unsuccessfully
achieved
prodigies
of
valour
and
even
by
their
defeats
had
protracted
the
date
of
their
own
independence
and
for
the
defence
of
the
population
and
arts
of
europe
against
a
barbarous
and
foe
my
thoughts
dwelt
with
rapturous
admiration
upon
the
exploits
of
the
heroic
huniades
and
his
greater
son
in
the
course
of
my
experience
i
had
seen
something
of
war
and
was
not
totally
unacquainted
with
its
consequences
meditating
as
i
had
done
in
the
dungeons
of
the
inquisition
if
ever
i
recovered
my
personal
liberty
and
my
freedom
of
action
a
journey
into
hungary
my
imagination
had
grown
familiar
with
captured
towns
and
smoking
villages
with
the
gallant
soldier
stretched
lifeless
on
the
plain
and
the
defenceless
mother
and
her
offspring
brutally
insulted
and
massacred
with
fields
laid
waste
and
a
people
lifting
up
their
hands
for
bread
determined
as
i
was
to
open
at
once
all
the
stores
of
my
wealth
i
thought
i
could
not
find
a
nobler
scene
for
its
display
i
resolved
to
pour
the
entire
stream
of
my
riches
like
a
mighty
river
to
fertilise
these
wasted
plains
and
revive
their
fainting
inhabitants
thus
proceeding
should
i
not
have
a
right
to
expect
to
find
myself
guarded
by
the
faithful
love
of
a
people
who
would
be
indebted
to
my
beneficence
for
every
breath
they
drew
this
was
the
proper
scene
in
which
for
the
possessor
of
the
philosopher
s
stone
to
take
up
his
abode
he
who
could
feel
his
ambition
satisfied
in
a
more
straitened
field
would
by
so
doing
prove
himself
unworthy
of
the
mighty
blessing
nothing
occurred
to
me
in
my
journey
of
importance
enough
to
obtain
a
place
in
this
history
when
i
arrived
i
found
the
condition
of
the
inhabitants
even
more
wretched
than
the
lawlessness
of
my
imagination
had
represented
it
in
the
battle
of
mohacz
the
last
of
the
line
of
their
native
sovereigns
together
with
the
flower
of
his
nobility
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
merciless
plague
of
war
what
survived
of
eminent
persons
in
the
state
assembled
soon
after
in
national
diet
and
elected
as
they
had
been
accustomed
to
do
one
of
the
most
illustrious
among
themselves
to
preside
over
the
councils
and
to
conduct
the
battles
of
their
country
but
the
princes
of
the
house
of
austria
ever
on
the
watch
for
the
aggrandisement
of
their
family
seized
the
opportunity
of
their
disastrous
situation
to
enslave
the
hungarians
to
their
sceptre
charles
the
fifth
caused
his
brother
ferdinand
whose
consort
was
only
sister
to
the
deceased
monarch
to
advance
his
claim
to
the
vacant
throne
and
to
enter
the
country
with
an
imperial
army
the
native
and
elected
sovereign
found
himself
in
the
weakened
condition
of
his
realm
unable
to
resist
the
austrian
arms
and
was
finally
driven
to
the
desperate
expedient
of
calling
in
the
turk
to
his
assistance
from
this
time
for
now
upwards
of
thirty
years
the
kingdom
had
been
a
prey
to
two
foreign
invaders
alternately
taking
and
retaking
her
most
considerable
towns
and
distributing
with
the
strictest
impartiality
the
miseries
of
war
to
her
devoted
inhabitants
solyman
the
magnificent
the
present
ottoman
emperor
in
no
long
time
threw
off
the
mask
and
like
his
rival
ferdinand
professed
to
fight
only
for
the
enlargement
of
his
own
dominions
while
the
claims
the
liberties
the
constitution
and
the
prosperity
of
hungary
were
alike
trodden
under
foot
in
the
protracted
and
sanguinary
struggle
at
the
period
at
which
i
entered
this
unfortunate
realm
the
turk
was
in
possession
of
buda
gran
temeswar
and
many
of
the
most
considerable
cities
and
ferdinand
who
had
now
succeeded
charles
in
the
imperial
dignity
had
been
obliged
to
withdraw
the
seat
of
the
national
government
from
the
first
of
these
towns
the
ancient
metropolis
to
the
comparatively
insignificant
city
of
presburg
the
war
between
the
two
parties
had
more
than
once
been
interrupted
not
indeed
by
the
more
stable
accommodations
of
a
treaty
of
peace
but
by
a
truce
variously
concluded
for
the
terms
of
six
or
of
eight
years
short
as
was
the
period
assigned
to
the
suspension
of
arms
it
was
never
suffered
to
reach
its
natural
termination
but
after
the
interval
of
one
or
two
summers
hostilities
did
not
fail
to
break
out
again
with
aggravated
symptoms
of
resentment
and
animosity
the
warfare
that
was
now
carried
on
had
more
in
it
of
passion
than
vigour
it
was
of
little
moment
to
the
interest
of
either
of
the
princes
under
whose
banners
it
was
conducted
but
it
was
not
on
that
account
the
less
but
rather
the
more
vexatious
and
distressing
to
the
hungarian
people
it
obeyed
no
rule
it
operated
in
every
direction
no
place
no
province
no
town
neither
the
church
nor
the
palace
neither
the
cottage
nor
the
castle
could
assure
safety
to
those
who
sought
its
protection
a
flying
party
which
was
in
the
west
would
almost
the
next
day
make
its
appearance
in
the
eastern
extremity
of
the
kingdom
arts
were
neglected
civilisation
was
destroyed
the
stern
and
haughty
baron
free
from
restraint
would
sally
from
his
castle
sometimes
in
pursuit
of
plunder
sometimes
of
private
resentment
and
revenge
the
starving
peasantry
gladly
enlisted
in
the
band
of
a
ferocious
partisan
for
bread
the
gangs
of
robbers
which
the
vigilant
policy
of
better
times
had
almost
annihilated
rose
again
in
importance
and
swelled
into
regiments
and
while
they
assumed
at
pleasure
the
denomination
of
adherents
to
ferdinand
or
to
solyman
perpetrated
every
species
of
excess
with
impunity
when
a
reflecting
spectator
surveys
a
country
in
a
condition
like
this
he
is
tempted
to
wonder
that
the
inhabitants
still
retain
the
courage
to
bestow
on
their
fields
any
sort
of
cultivation
and
that
the
licensed
or
the
unlicensed
robber
still
finds
something
over
which
to
extend
the
fangs
of
his
rapacity
i
had
not
long
passed
the
gates
of
vienna
before
i
began
to
observe
the
symptoms
of
that
which
i
had
come
from
the
pyrenees
and
the
garonne
to
visit
the
farther
i
advanced
the
more
melancholy
was
the
scene
i
beheld
the
country
in
some
places
entirely
deserted
villages
laid
in
ashes
cities
reduced
to
the
dimensions
and
insignificance
of
villages
fields
fertilised
or
made
rank
with
the
manure
of
human
blood
the
roads
broken
up
the
erections
of
human
ingenuity
almost
obliterated
mills
thrown
down
rivers
choked
up
and
rendered
stagnant
a
few
solitary
plots
of
cultivation
scattered
amidst
the
mighty
waste
the
inhabitants
i
saw
appeared
terrified
sickly
dejected
and
despairing
there
was
scarcely
one
who
earlier
or
later
had
not
lost
a
father
or
a
brother
whose
wife
had
not
been
made
the
victim
of
brutal
lust
or
who
had
not
seen
his
children
butchered
before
his
face
persons
of
the
more
opulent
classes
could
not
travel
the
country
in
safety
without
being
armed
and
associated
in
companies
and
caravans
i
was
myself
obliged
to
obtain
the
protection
of
parties
of
soldiers
who
from
time
to
time
happened
to
be
marching
in
the
route
i
pursued
the
savage
neglect
into
which
every
thing
was
declining
produced
in
repeated
instances
a
contagious
air
and
pestilential
diseases
while
dearth
and
famine
unrelentingly
haunted
the
steps
of
those
whom
the
sword
and
the
pestilence
had
spared
such
is
war
such
are
the
evils
nations
willingly
plunge
into
or
are
compelled
to
endure
to
pamper
the
senseless
luxury
or
pride
of
a
ferdinand
and
a
solyman
i
proceeded
as
i
had
originally
determined
to
do
to
buda
the
metropolis
of
the
kingdom
it
was
in
the
hands
of
the
turk
it
was
of
little
importance
to
me
whether
the
monarch
of
the
soil
were
a
mahometan
or
a
christian
my
mind
was
engrossed
by
considerations
of
a
very
different
magnitude
i
came
to
relieve
and
assist
to
the
utmost
of
my
power
the
inhabitants
of
the
country
in
the
extremity
of
their
distress
i
had
not
proceeded
thus
far
without
bestowing
a
certain
strictness
of
reflection
on
the
subject
i
easily
saw
that
if
i
would
confer
a
substantial
benefit
on
this
unfortunate
nation
i
had
scarcely
any
other
means
for
the
purpose
than
that
of
reviving
among
them
a
spirit
of
industry
i
was
aware
that
in
the
strictness
of
the
term
money
was
not
wealth
that
it
could
be
neither
eaten
nor
drunk
that
it
would
not
of
itself
either
clothe
the
naked
or
shelter
the
houseless
and
that
it
was
unable
but
by
a
circuitous
operation
to
increase
the
quantity
of
provisions
or
commodities
that
the
country
afforded
it
was
my
business
therefore
not
to
proceed
idly
in
the
distribution
of
gold
but
to
meditate
seriously
my
plan
of
operations
i
fixed
myself
in
a
spacious
and
beautiful
mansion
in
the
capital
this
in
the
present
distressed
and
depopulated
condition
of
hungary
it
was
not
difficult
to
procure
the
house
i
selected
had
for
centuries
been
the
principal
residence
of
the
illustrious
family
of
ragotski
but
the
present
representative
of
that
family
after
having
seen
his
sons
one
after
another
killed
in
the
battles
of
his
country
and
his
estates
ruined
by
military
depredation
had
found
himself
compelled
to
fly
in
his
old
age
and
had
taken
refuge
with
a
distant
branch
of
the
same
house
in
the
great
duchy
of
lithuania
it
was
not
necessary
for
me
to
proceed
to
any
great
extent
in
the
first
instance
in
the
manufacture
of
my
wealth
i
had
every
facility
for
adding
to
my
store
from
time
to
time
as
circumstances
should
demand
i
determined
to
open
my
operations
with
the
article
of
building
there
was
sufficient
need
of
it
one
half
of
the
houses
through
most
of
the
districts
of
lower
or
western
hungary
in
particular
were
ruined
and
untenantable
i
did
not
begin
with
erecting
palaces
i
felt
that
the
first
claimants
in
the
present
emergency
were
the
peasant
and
the
cultivator
i
was
more
desirous
that
the
rustic
than
the
prince
should
be
well
lodged
and
accommodated
provided
with
the
means
of
rest
after
fatigue
and
secured
against
the
invasion
of
ungenial
seasons
my
reasons
for
beginning
with
building
were
these
it
was
my
purpose
to
stimulate
and
revive
the
industry
of
the
nation
i
was
desirous
of
doing
this
with
the
least
practicable
violence
upon
the
inclinations
and
freedom
of
the
inhabitants
had
i
required
of
those
to
whom
i
addressed
myself
that
they
should
fertilise
the
earth
the
seeds
with
which
it
should
be
impregnated
might
be
wanting
i
should
have
a
nice
balance
to
adjust
between
what
was
necessary
for
immediate
subsistence
and
what
might
be
applied
as
the
basis
of
future
a
point
better
left
to
its
spontaneous
level
i
might
be
impeded
and
controlled
by
a
thousand
circumstances
and
at
every
step
but
the
materials
of
building
are
to
be
found
in
every
country
no
seasons
can
impair
no
malignity
of
man
can
annihilate
them
wherever
there
are
quarries
there
is
stone
wherever
there
is
clay
there
are
the
means
of
manufacturing
bricks
i
was
anxious
to
leave
the
rest
of
the
great
process
of
human
accommodation
to
its
course
while
i
employed
labourers
and
paid
them
their
wages
there
would
be
in
the
mildest
and
most
salutary
mode
a
continual
influx
of
money
into
the
market
the
increase
of
the
precious
metals
would
give
new
alacrity
to
the
operations
of
traffic
the
buyers
would
come
forward
with
double
confidence
the
venders
would
be
eager
to
meet
the
activity
and
spirit
of
the
demand
ardour
and
hope
would
revisit
the
human
mind
and
the
industry
i
created
and
the
accommodations
of
one
kind
at
least
to
which
i
gave
birth
would
inoculate
the
other
departments
of
the
community
with
a
similar
industry
i
came
into
hungary
in
the
spring
of
the
season
was
favourable
to
seeding
and
cultivation
i
seemed
to
enter
on
my
undertaking
with
the
happiest
auspices
some
time
however
must
necessarily
elapse
between
the
period
of
impregnating
the
soil
and
that
of
the
future
harvest
though
i
laid
it
down
therefore
as
a
law
to
myself
to
commit
the
least
practicable
violence
upon
the
genuine
action
of
human
society
in
pursuit
of
the
means
of
subsistence
i
thought
proper
in
a
certain
degree
to
engage
in
the
importation
of
corn
from
poland
silesia
and
other
neighbouring
countries
this
seemed
an
eligible
measure
if
it
were
only
that
i
might
show
others
the
way
and
excite
them
by
my
example
i
procured
agents
i
extended
my
concerns
in
various
directions
over
the
navigable
rivers
i
formed
magazines
it
would
have
been
contrary
to
the
genius
of
my
undertaking
either
to
make
a
gratuitous
distribution
of
what
i
purchased
or
to
sell
it
at
such
low
prices
as
to
drive
other
speculators
whose
spirit
of
enterprise
might
happily
with
mine
out
of
the
market
however
indifferent
i
might
feel
to
the
receipt
of
pecuniary
compensation
it
was
necessary
that
in
the
concerns
of
barter
and
trade
i
should
assume
the
exterior
of
a
merchant
nor
did
i
wholly
confine
my
exertions
within
the
occupations
of
an
architect
and
a
these
or
rather
the
former
of
the
two
i
regarded
as
my
true
and
genuine
province
but
i
did
not
so
far
enslave
myself
to
my
own
maxims
as
to
negative
in
all
instances
the
direct
demands
of
want
i
was
not
anxious
to
convert
a
nation
or
an
army
of
men
into
my
personal
adherents
and
retainers
i
was
rather
desirous
to
avoid
this
as
a
dangerous
source
of
obloquy
i
did
not
therefore
always
decline
by
pretended
loans
to
assist
other
men
to
employ
labourers
as
well
as
myself
to
act
upon
their
own
designs
and
prosecute
their
own
fortune
the
cries
of
the
poor
man
the
widow
and
the
orphan
were
sometimes
too
importunate
and
too
well
justified
by
their
unquestionable
necessities
to
allow
me
to
withhold
from
them
my
alms
in
a
few
instances
i
conveyed
my
supplies
anonymously
to
persons
whose
dignity
of
birth
or
whose
proud
independence
would
have
been
too
grievously
wounded
if
they
had
known
their
benefactor
i
was
cautious
and
apprehensive
as
to
the
direct
dispensing
of
money
but
not
entirely
bent
against
it
i
regarded
it
as
a
precarious
but
in
some
cases
a
necessary
interference
the
impulse
which
by
these
various
measures
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
generate
seemed
to
have
the
effect
so
far
at
least
as
the
sphere
of
my
activity
extended
to
revive
the
almost
expiring
life
of
the
country
dejection
and
hopeless
indolence
when
i
commenced
my
operations
were
written
in
every
face
the
miserable
inhabitants
crawled
along
the
roads
or
the
street
their
hands
idly
relaxed
by
their
side
and
their
slow
and
painful
steps
scarcely
supporting
their
lifeless
trunk
when
my
plan
became
known
and
i
had
already
in
a
few
instances
reduced
my
maxims
into
practice
it
was
as
if
the
mellow
and
blast
of
a
trumpet
had
wakened
their
sleeping
souls
their
eyes
lightened
with
intelligence
the
tear
of
anguish
was
wiped
from
their
faded
cheeks
the
smile
of
hope
slowly
expelled
and
faintly
succeeded
to
the
bitter
expression
of
despair
busy
and
active
thoughts
gave
new
motion
to
their
limbs
and
quickness
to
their
steps
the
labourer
was
seen
hastening
from
place
to
place
the
sound
of
the
hammer
the
saw
and
the
various
tools
of
the
workman
was
to
be
heard
from
every
side
the
conduct
i
pursued
necessarily
fixed
upon
me
a
considerable
portion
of
public
attention
i
was
a
foreigner
destitute
of
connections
and
having
no
previous
acquaintance
with
any
individual
in
the
country
i
was
in
appearance
a
mere
boy
a
young
man
in
all
the
flower
and
bloom
of
adolescence
and
who
must
be
supposed
to
have
just
entered
into
possession
of
his
patrimony
these
things
tended
to
increase
the
public
wonder
and
to
render
the
mystery
of
my
proceedings
more
perplexing
and
obscure
in
the
age
of
genial
warmth
and
melting
softness
i
did
not
appear
accessible
to
those
passions
which
haunt
the
days
and
too
often
undermine
the
virtues
of
youth
youth
is
the
season
of
benevolence
but
benevolence
is
rarely
as
seemed
to
be
my
case
the
only
fruit
that
youth
is
found
to
produce
there
was
a
maturity
and
a
justness
of
adaptation
in
my
plans
not
less
foreign
from
what
those
who
surrounded
me
would
have
expected
me
to
display
the
apparent
disinterestedness
and
modesty
of
my
proceedings
were
not
lost
upon
the
spectators
the
consequence
of
all
this
was
that
the
sieur
de
chatillon
such
was
the
name
i
at
this
time
assumed
was
regarded
as
a
phenomenon
which
could
not
be
too
much
admired
or
too
loudly
extolled
wherever
i
appeared
the
people
followed
me
with
their
gratitude
and
blessings
ballads
were
written
in
my
praise
the
very
children
were
taught
with
their
infant
tongues
to
lisp
the
virtues
of
the
saviour
of
hungary
my
doors
were
besieged
my
steps
were
watched
i
could
move
no
where
without
public
observation
i
was
importuned
with
petitions
without
end
yet
if
any
petitioner
showed
himself
presumptuous
and
intrusive
the
whole
multitude
of
bystanders
was
ready
to
repress
his
indiscretion
and
teach
him
the
respect
that
was
due
to
their
generous
benefactor
who
never
refused
any
thing
but
what
it
would
be
improper
and
injurious
to
grant
such
was
the
treatment
i
experienced
in
buda
and
the
neighbouring
districts
whether
i
looked
within
or
without
i
was
equally
presented
with
incitements
to
i
sent
forth
labour
accompanied
with
her
best
and
loveliest
companions
plenty
and
health
congratulation
and
contentment
to
scatter
blessings
through
the
land
i
felt
that
i
was
prompted
to
this
conduct
by
none
of
the
motives
of
vulgar
ambition
i
desired
neither
lordships
nor
estates
neither
elevation
of
rank
nor
extension
of
prerogative
sufficient
to
myself
if
i
effected
the
happiness
of
the
people
and
they
confessed
me
their
benefactor
my
every
passion
would
then
be
gratified
the
utmost
boundary
of
my
personal
wishes
proceeded
no
farther
than
this
that
i
might
be
honoured
and
loved
what
i
desired
i
obtained
the
youth
i
had
procured
to
myself
through
the
medium
of
the
was
like
what
we
are
told
of
the
youth
of
job
when
i
went
out
through
the
gate
of
the
city
the
young
men
saw
me
and
hid
themselves
and
the
aged
arose
and
stood
up
the
nobles
refrained
from
talking
and
the
princes
laid
their
hands
upon
their
mouths
when
the
ear
heard
me
then
it
blessed
me
and
when
the
eye
saw
me
it
gave
witness
to
my
here
it
may
be
thought
i
had
ascended
to
that
sphere
which
it
was
fit
the
possessor
of
the
philosopher
s
stone
should
fill
and
reaped
the
rewards
to
which
a
man
thus
endowed
ought
to
be
forward
to
entitle
himself
nor
will
i
affirm
that
i
was
insensible
to
the
gratifications
of
my
present
situation
though
i
sought
to
escape
from
the
applause
that
pursued
me
yet
there
is
something
in
the
nature
of
the
human
mind
that
makes
it
impossible
for
us
to
hear
it
without
complacence
it
was
not
however
a
boisterous
and
obtrusive
acclamation
that
satisfied
me
a
certain
inwrought
modesty
of
nature
made
me
listen
to
noisy
commendations
with
a
sentiment
of
shame
they
seemed
to
be
more
than
any
thing
i
had
done
could
deserve
or
they
seemed
to
be
in
a
tone
from
which
the
delicacy
of
a
virtuous
mind
shrinks
back
displeased
they
were
so
obstreperous
as
to
take
from
me
the
power
of
hearing
the
sweeter
verdict
of
my
own
conscience
no
it
was
the
unbidden
tear
that
glistened
in
the
eye
of
my
beneficiaries
the
tongue
that
faltered
beneath
the
essays
of
gratitude
the
overwhelmed
heart
that
had
no
power
to
express
itself
the
hand
of
the
parent
that
was
stretched
out
to
his
children
and
dumbly
said
these
these
shall
thank
you
it
was
these
things
that
i
felt
within
as
the
balsam
of
my
life
and
the
ambrosia
of
heaven
chapter
xxxvi
yet
thus
surrounded
and
regaled
with
this
animated
praise
i
was
not
content
i
wanted
a
friend
i
was
alone
amidst
the
innumerable
multitudes
of
those
i
had
blessed
i
knew
no
cordiality
i
could
repose
no
confidence
i
could
find
no
equal
i
was
like
a
god
who
dispenses
his
bounties
profusely
through
twenty
climates
but
who
at
the
same
time
sits
separate
elevated
and
alone
in
the
highest
heaven
the
reader
may
if
he
pleases
despise
me
for
the
confession
but
i
felt
that
i
was
not
formed
for
the
happiness
of
a
god
i
was
not
however
long
sufficiently
at
leisure
thus
to
refine
upon
the
deficiencies
of
my
situation
i
had
engaged
in
a
task
of
extreme
delicacy
in
which
the
smallest
failure
would
draw
along
with
it
the
most
serious
consequences
mine
was
not
an
undertaking
that
had
for
its
object
to
supply
those
around
me
with
luxuries
or
to
augment
the
stock
of
their
cheerful
relaxations
and
amusements
the
very
existence
of
my
beneficiaries
depended
on
its
success
i
had
put
myself
in
a
considerable
degree
with
whatever
diffidence
and
caution
in
the
room
of
the
course
of
nature
and
had
taken
the
administration
of
the
common
benefits
of
human
society
into
my
hands
the
populace
are
ever
ready
to
construe
this
delegation
in
the
strictest
sense
unqualified
to
trace
the
wheels
and
combinations
of
the
great
machine
if
prosperity
is
their
lot
they
willingly
ascribe
it
to
their
protectors
and
governors
and
if
they
are
unfortunate
it
is
against
them
that
the
storm
of
their
resentment
is
directed
the
moment
they
are
thus
irritated
their
impatience
is
too
great
to
admit
of
correctives
and
remedies
in
the
fury
of
their
disappointment
they
disturb
every
thing
and
render
that
irreparable
and
fatal
which
was
at
first
only
doubtful
and
unpromising
my
proceedings
as
i
have
already
said
bore
in
the
commencement
the
most
benignant
face
and
seemed
a
revival
of
this
despairing
and
unfortunate
nation
little
less
than
miraculous
the
regular
labours
in
which
the
inhabitants
became
engaged
restored
a
healthful
tone
to
their
minds
the
payments
they
duly
received
seemed
to
discharge
them
from
all
anxious
solicitude
and
as
by
my
own
efforts
and
the
enterprises
of
others
the
market
was
supplied
with
provisions
they
had
no
difficulty
in
exchanging
these
payments
for
the
necessaries
of
life
the
supply
of
the
market
at
first
was
easy
the
universal
dejection
that
preceded
though
it
had
not
prevented
all
exertions
for
that
purpose
had
rendered
those
exertions
too
feeble
for
extensive
success
the
strenuous
efforts
that
were
now
made
were
productive
of
a
copious
supply
but
they
rendered
each
importation
more
difficult
than
the
importation
before
the
demand
continued
the
same
the
relief
was
every
day
more
diminutive
and
precarious
the
harvest
was
however
advancing
with
the
happiest
auspices
and
though
some
time
must
yet
be
consumed
in
expectation
it
was
probable
frugality
and
fortitude
might
enable
the
inhabitants
to
hold
out
till
the
season
of
plenty
should
arrive
but
fortitude
is
not
the
virtue
of
a
populace
the
higher
had
been
their
hopes
and
the
more
unexpected
their
deliverance
with
so
much
the
more
blank
and
melancholy
a
countenance
they
beheld
this
unexpected
delay
and
retrogression
not
understanding
the
powers
by
which
i
acted
they
blindly
ascribed
to
me
the
faculty
of
doing
whatever
i
pleased
as
long
as
every
thing
went
on
prosperously
they
were
grateful
the
moment
a
reverse
occurred
they
were
inclined
to
murmur
they
made
no
allowance
for
the
limited
capacities
of
a
human
creature
they
imputed
whatever
was
unpleasing
to
indifference
or
ill
will
the
price
of
commodities
after
having
for
a
while
become
moderate
now
rapidly
rose
again
this
was
partly
the
consequence
of
the
increased
quantity
of
the
precious
metals
by
means
of
which
any
assignable
sum
bore
a
less
proportion
to
the
provisions
of
the
market
than
it
had
done
before
bread
was
at
a
very
high
price
and
it
occasionally
happened
to
buyers
who
did
not
come
early
enough
that
there
was
no
bread
to
be
purchased
the
doors
of
the
houses
where
it
was
sold
were
besieged
the
industrious
poor
appeared
before
them
with
the
first
faint
dawn
of
the
morning
s
light
here
they
consumed
hours
of
painful
expectation
in
grievous
addition
to
the
hours
of
their
customary
fatigue
the
whole
was
a
scene
of
anguish
and
calamity
the
passions
of
those
who
composed
it
mingled
with
the
distress
and
rendered
it
too
heavy
to
be
borne
anticipating
famine
they
felt
the
mischiefs
of
it
before
it
arrived
never
was
the
demand
so
urgent
it
seemed
as
if
the
capacity
of
men
s
appetites
was
enlarged
and
the
cravings
of
hunger
became
more
insatiable
in
proportion
to
the
smallness
of
the
supply
to
people
thus
circumstanced
it
would
have
been
vain
to
recommend
frugality
and
moderation
they
devoured
the
food
with
their
eyes
while
it
was
yet
beyond
the
reach
of
their
hands
and
the
lesson
you
read
them
would
have
sounded
in
their
ears
as
if
you
had
bid
them
die
to
escape
the
danger
of
dying
the
crowds
which
the
necessity
of
purchasing
bread
brought
together
at
certain
hours
when
assembled
naturally
entered
into
the
discussion
of
their
present
discontents
they
were
not
satisfied
with
the
discourse
and
jostling
of
the
morning
the
habits
produced
by
these
noisy
assemblies
had
a
secret
charm
with
them
and
drew
them
together
at
seasons
of
less
urgent
demand
they
patroled
the
streets
they
were
loud
in
the
expressions
of
their
dissatisfaction
with
the
inconsequence
incident
to
the
lower
orders
of
mankind
they
threatened
to
destroy
the
mills
the
markets
the
places
of
sale
the
means
and
materials
by
which
their
wants
were
to
be
supplied
in
the
midst
of
these
scenes
of
tumult
and
confusion
it
is
not
to
be
imagined
that
i
escaped
uncensured
far
otherwise
in
proportion
to
the
gratitude
and
adoration
with
which
they
had
lately
regarded
me
were
their
detestation
and
abhorrence
now
my
interference
was
spoken
of
with
contempt
and
execration
for
what
purpose
had
i
a
foreigner
come
into
their
country
and
intruded
myself
into
their
affairs
why
had
i
impiously
taken
them
out
of
the
hands
of
their
heavenly
father
whose
care
was
so
constant
and
whose
relief
so
certain
it
was
on
my
part
a
despicable
vanity
and
presumption
which
the
justice
of
providence
could
not
fail
to
avenge
and
they
must
now
suffer
the
punishment
of
my
blasphemy
but
they
did
not
stop
here
there
was
no
horrible
calumny
which
they
did
not
invent
or
give
credit
to
against
me
they
imputed
to
me
the
basest
personal
motives
for
what
i
had
done
under
the
hypocritical
pretence
they
cried
of
being
their
benefactor
and
saviour
i
was
using
them
only
for
my
private
ends
i
had
become
a
purchaser
and
vender
of
corn
for
the
single
purpose
of
increasing
my
fortune
the
present
scarcity
they
were
well
assured
was
artificial
and
of
my
own
contriving
i
had
magazines
in
different
stations
on
the
borders
which
when
the
price
was
risen
to
the
standard
of
my
avarice
and
when
half
the
people
had
fallen
victims
to
my
inhumanity
i
purposed
to
dispose
of
to
an
immense
profit
such
were
the
aspersions
to
which
my
character
became
generally
exposed
by
the
populace
who
now
experienced
the
unsatisfied
cravings
of
hunger
and
in
whom
my
proceedings
had
excited
hope
only
to
be
followed
by
a
more
cruel
disappointment
they
were
greedily
credited
many
who
knew
their
falsehood
were
yet
zealous
to
propagate
them
short
as
had
been
my
residence
in
hungary
i
had
made
many
enemies
it
is
to
be
feared
that
no
man
can
be
assiduous
and
indefatigable
in
the
service
of
others
without
incurring
that
consequence
i
employed
a
great
number
of
workmen
every
one
whom
for
whatever
reason
i
refused
to
employ
every
one
who
being
unqualified
for
the
service
i
required
looked
with
an
envious
eye
on
the
better
fortune
of
his
neighbour
was
well
disposed
to
be
my
enemy
persons
of
no
contemptible
account
in
the
community
had
been
excited
by
expectations
of
profit
to
engage
in
the
importation
of
corn
these
persons
viewed
my
efforts
in
the
same
department
with
a
suspicious
eye
and
regarded
a
man
who
however
cautious
in
his
proceedings
was
not
regulated
by
the
same
motive
as
a
most
pernicious
rival
my
sudden
elevation
and
importance
in
the
country
were
viewed
with
not
more
astonishment
than
aversion
by
those
whose
importance
i
obscured
they
could
not
hear
with
patience
of
an
upstart
a
boy
a
stranger
one
universally
unknown
elbowing
out
the
influence
of
all
that
was
most
illustrious
and
venerable
in
the
community
and
robbing
them
daily
of
their
adherents
and
retainers
all
these
persons
left
no
effort
untried
to
defame
my
character
the
impulse
once
given
the
turbulent
disposition
of
the
populace
became
every
day
more
formidable
it
is
much
easier
to
disseminate
a
temper
of
this
sort
than
to
quell
it
my
opulent
foes
might
take
alarm
at
its
excesses
and
desire
to
undo
what
they
had
done
but
it
was
beyond
their
power
every
day
i
feared
lest
from
threats
and
invectives
the
populace
should
proceed
to
violence
every
night
i
thought
i
had
reason
to
congratulate
myself
that
the
day
had
passed
without
waste
and
spoil
committed
by
them
on
the
means
of
their
subsistence
or
was
not
marked
with
the
destruction
of
their
champion
and
benefactor
in
some
places
a
sort
of
petty
sedition
broke
out
among
the
labourers
i
employed
in
the
morning
they
refused
to
work
why
should
a
man
work
they
muttered
when
after
all
he
may
starve
with
the
wages
of
his
labour
in
his
possession
at
night
they
became
impatient
and
furious
and
demanded
from
my
superintendents
and
the
food
which
in
the
morning
they
had
refused
to
earn
and
were
therefore
now
unable
to
purchase
i
had
already
had
some
experience
in
the
nature
of
popular
tumults
i
had
now
no
marchese
filosanto
at
hand
to
persuade
me
of
their
inefficacy
and
if
i
had
i
should
no
longer
have
lent
an
ear
to
his
serene
and
unsuspicious
generosity
i
felt
the
reality
of
the
danger
i
saw
the
storm
as
it
blackened
in
my
horizon
and
was
deeply
convinced
what
it
would
be
if
it
burst
upon
my
head
it
may
be
imagined
with
what
feelings
i
viewed
my
whole
design
on
the
point
to
be
subverted
by
the
unruliness
of
those
for
whose
benefit
it
had
been
planned
it
is
true
i
had
now
no
darling
relations
to
be
involved
in
my
fate
no
incomparable
wife
no
daughters
illustrious
in
innocence
and
beauty
yet
my
feelings
were
scarcely
less
pungent
than
they
had
been
at
the
period
of
my
catastrophe
at
pisa
i
had
blamed
myself
in
review
that
in
my
experiments
at
constance
at
dresden
at
pisa
and
at
madrid
i
had
not
commenced
upon
a
sufficiently
ample
scale
but
had
suffered
myself
to
be
frustrated
by
the
ingloriousness
of
my
precautions
that
had
not
been
my
error
in
the
present
instance
yet
my
success
now
promised
to
be
scarcely
more
flattering
than
upon
former
occasions
i
had
looked
for
happiness
as
the
result
of
the
benevolence
and
philanthropy
i
was
exerting
i
found
only
anxiety
and
a
well
grounded
fear
even
for
my
personal
safety
let
no
man
build
on
the
expected
gratitude
of
those
he
spends
his
strength
to
serve
let
him
be
beneficent
if
he
will
but
let
him
not
depend
for
his
happiness
on
the
conviction
of
his
rectitude
and
virtue
that
is
to
be
impressed
on
the
minds
of
others
there
is
a
principle
in
the
human
breast
that
easily
induces
them
to
regard
every
thing
that
can
be
done
for
them
as
no
more
than
their
due
and
speedily
discharges
them
from
the
oppressive
consciousness
of
obligation
there
is
a
levity
in
the
generality
of
men
that
entails
on
them
a
continual
oblivion
of
past
benefits
and
makes
one
recent
disappointment
of
more
importance
in
their
eyes
than
an
eternity
of
kindnesses
and
condescension
i
shall
have
other
instances
of
ingratitude
to
display
in
what
yet
remains
to
be
related
of
my
story
my
nights
were
restless
my
thoughts
were
in
arms
what
was
it
that
it
became
me
to
do
in
the
present
emergency
sometimes
in
the
bitterness
of
my
heart
hating
myself
hating
the
endowments
of
the
stranger
hating
a
race
of
beings
who
denied
all
credit
to
the
most
exertions
for
their
advantage
i
determined
to
withdraw
unobserved
from
my
attendants
and
clients
and
bid
adieu
to
hungary
for
ever
but
whither
was
i
to
fly
what
was
i
to
do
next
what
experiment
could
i
make
of
the
purposes
to
which
to
apply
the
philosopher
s
stone
that
i
had
not
already
made
these
questions
to
none
of
which
i
could
give
a
satisfactory
answer
checked
the
career
of
my
passion
and
gave
pause
to
my
thoughts
whatever
i
did
i
was
determined
to
do
nothing
rashly
nor
to
quit
a
great
experiment
without
its
having
been
fully
tried
it
was
no
light
concern
no
trivial
child
in
which
i
had
embarked
i
had
taken
the
welfare
perhaps
the
existence
of
a
great
and
heroic
nation
under
my
protection
in
this
glorious
vocation
it
did
not
become
me
to
be
lightly
discouraged
what
if
those
i
served
and
saved
did
not
show
themselves
sufficiently
sensible
to
the
exertions
i
made
for
them
i
ought
to
purify
my
bosom
on
an
occasion
like
this
from
base
and
ignoble
motives
and
to
deem
myself
sufficiently
recompensed
by
my
conscious
virtue
what
if
the
service
in
which
i
had
engaged
now
appeared
to
be
a
service
of
hazard
and
peril
is
there
any
great
undertaking
that
can
be
separated
from
this
condition
if
hastily
from
cowardice
from
pique
or
from
any
other
motive
i
deserted
the
business
on
which
i
had
entered
what
was
to
become
of
my
mistaken
indeed
but
in
that
case
most
unfortunate
clients
the
greater
was
the
crisis
to
which
they
were
exposed
the
more
were
unremitted
vigilance
and
uncommon
powers
necessary
to
guide
them
amidst
its
rocks
and
its
quicksands
i
saw
thousands
of
men
who
for
several
weeks
had
fed
as
it
were
from
the
stores
of
my
bounty
by
a
propensity
inseparable
from
the
human
heart
i
became
attached
to
the
work
of
my
meditations
and
the
labour
of
my
thoughts
all
their
fickleness
their
injustice
even
the
atrocious
calumnies
they
admitted
and
propagated
against
me
could
not
wean
my
attachment
from
beings
a
great
portion
of
whom
but
for
my
interference
would
i
believed
long
ere
this
have
expired
of
hunger
in
the
peculiar
and
urgent
circumstances
in
which
i
found
myself
no
expedient
was
so
obvious
as
that
of
calling
in
the
interference
of
the
government
under
which
i
lived
it
was
necessary
that
the
resources
of
national
subsistence
should
be
defended
from
the
wanton
spoil
of
those
who
when
they
were
annihilated
must
inevitably
perish
it
was
necessary
that
the
benefactor
of
hungary
who
i
flattered
myself
was
still
able
to
watch
effectively
for
her
advantage
should
be
protected
from
her
misguided
resentment
the
alternative
was
singularly
painful
to
my
feelings
the
pride
with
which
my
unparalleled
endowments
inspired
me
was
deeply
wounded
when
i
was
compelled
to
confess
that
i
was
not
alone
equal
to
the
task
i
had
undertaken
and
that
i
must
submit
to
call
in
a
foreign
auxiliary
i
augured
little
favourable
from
the
interference
of
government
which
if
i
implored
i
could
scarcely
expect
to
guide
which
was
not
likely
to
submit
to
my
principle
of
rendering
its
interference
the
mildest
and
smallest
that
the
nature
of
the
case
would
admit
but
puffed
up
with
presumption
and
intoxicated
with
authority
would
probably
leave
no
concern
of
the
public
welfare
uninvaded
least
of
all
could
i
anticipate
much
of
good
from
a
turkish
government
but
what
could
i
do
i
could
discover
no
other
expedient
influenced
by
the
views
i
have
recited
i
had
hitherto
kept
myself
as
far
from
the
observation
of
the
political
directors
of
the
state
as
i
could
but
my
cautiousness
and
reserve
were
now
at
an
end
with
my
eyes
open
i
exposed
myself
to
all
the
evils
that
might
attend
on
my
proceeding
i
determined
to
apply
to
the
bashaw
of
the
province
previously
to
my
taking
this
step
i
had
the
precaution
to
enquire
his
character
he
was
the
genuine
offspring
of
the
turkish
system
of
government
his
name
was
muzaffer
bey
he
was
originally
a
circassian
slave
then
a
janissary
and
rising
by
insensible
gradation
had
at
length
been
appointed
bashaw
of
buda
which
as
being
the
immediate
frontier
between
austria
and
the
porte
was
at
this
time
the
most
arduous
situation
in
the
gift
of
the
sultan
he
was
esteemed
a
good
soldier
he
had
been
early
distinguished
by
his
dexterity
in
military
exercises
he
had
since
seen
much
service
and
in
every
situation
in
which
he
was
placed
had
earned
commendation
and
honour
he
was
abstemious
and
hardy
for
himself
he
neither
pampered
his
appetites
nor
shrunk
from
severity
and
he
had
as
little
indulgence
for
those
under
his
command
as
for
his
own
person
yet
he
was
indebted
for
his
present
eminence
more
to
the
arts
of
the
courtier
than
to
his
merits
in
the
field
his
chief
care
had
ever
been
to
recommend
himself
to
those
above
him
and
to
obtain
the
good
will
of
his
equals
for
the
opinion
of
his
inferiors
he
gave
himself
little
concern
with
considerable
ability
he
laboured
under
no
check
from
either
principle
or
ingenuous
pride
and
therefore
was
extremely
successful
in
his
attacks
on
the
inclination
of
those
he
sought
the
habits
of
his
mind
had
modified
the
lines
of
his
countenance
and
the
tones
of
his
voice
except
to
his
dependants
and
the
poor
he
almost
always
spoke
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
and
his
enunciation
was
oily
copious
and
insinuating
if
he
ever
adopted
a
different
manner
the
variation
was
only
in
the
means
not
the
end
and
when
he
seemed
to
travel
by
an
opposite
road
the
goal
at
which
he
aimed
was
the
same
he
never
consulted
any
oracle
but
that
of
his
apparent
interest
if
he
had
any
insolence
in
his
nature
he
regarded
his
slaves
and
those
under
his
military
command
as
affording
a
sufficient
sphere
for
its
exercise
he
had
no
affections
to
disturb
him
from
his
bent
he
had
no
passions
but
the
of
superior
cunning
and
the
sordid
love
of
pelf
this
account
of
the
man
with
whom
i
had
to
deal
was
far
from
encouraging
but
i
had
no
alternative
i
sent
to
signify
my
desire
to
confer
with
him
or
to
speak
more
accurately
to
ask
in
the
eastern
manner
when
it
would
be
agreeable
to
him
to
receive
a
present
of
which
i
requested
his
acceptance
he
appointed
the
morning
of
the
following
day
i
prepared
a
gift
such
as
might
tend
to
conciliate
his
favour
without
marking
in
the
donor
the
possession
of
immoderate
wealth
it
consisted
of
silks
and
muslins
with
a
small
piece
of
plate
of
exquisite
workmanship
my
present
was
borne
by
two
of
my
servants
we
were
ushered
to
the
bashaw
in
his
private
apartment
there
were
two
or
three
persons
in
attendance
upon
him
they
examined
my
present
together
and
without
condescending
to
express
much
approbation
i
could
nevertheless
discern
that
the
bashaw
was
pleased
with
it
this
ceremony
concluded
muzaffer
ordered
what
i
had
brought
to
be
taken
into
a
different
apartment
and
every
other
person
withdrawing
we
were
left
alone
while
the
bashaw
was
examining
my
gift
i
took
the
opportunity
of
considering
his
person
he
appeared
to
be
about
sixty
years
of
age
his
complexion
dark
and
muddy
his
features
coarse
and
distorted
his
mustachoes
remarkably
large
his
person
though
bony
and
muscular
considerably
below
the
middle
size
and
his
figure
ungainly
and
ungraceful
i
felt
surprised
that
such
a
man
should
ever
have
been
an
excellent
soldier
or
have
risen
from
a
low
rank
to
one
of
the
first
situations
of
the
empire
to
look
at
him
he
seemed
better
formed
for
the
vice
of
a
comedy
than
the
ruler
of
a
nation
he
raised
his
eyes
towards
me
askance
as
he
sat
leaning
on
his
elbow
and
said
you
call
yourself
the
sieur
de
and
your
age
is
two
and
i
am
glad
you
are
come
to
me
i
intended
to
have
sent
for
you
and
you
have
saved
me
the
i
made
many
apologies
for
my
intrusion
but
added
that
i
had
a
petition
to
prefer
and
i
hoped
he
would
favour
me
with
a
hearing
not
at
all
not
at
all
do
not
call
it
an
intrusion
it
is
necessary
i
should
be
acquainted
with
he
proceeded
you
have
undertaken
to
confer
great
benefits
on
the
subjects
of
the
grand
signior
my
master
to
rescue
them
from
famine
young
rich
a
stranger
unknown
to
my
master
unknown
to
his
subjects
i
understand
that
you
have
spared
no
labour
or
expense
to
bring
about
their
welfare
this
is
really
a
very
extraordinary
case
your
merit
is
unprecedented
i
do
not
feel
myself
competent
to
reward
i
answered
that
i
laid
no
claim
to
uncommon
merit
that
every
temper
had
its
particular
gratifications
and
that
i
found
as
real
a
luxury
in
the
proceedings
he
had
remarked
as
other
men
did
in
the
excesses
of
the
table
or
the
promiscuous
enjoyments
of
the
harem
it
is
out
of
my
power
continued
he
to
remunerate
you
as
you
deserve
i
must
send
you
to
i
perceived
that
this
was
the
first
essay
of
his
artifice
i
informed
him
which
i
have
no
doubt
he
knew
well
enough
before
that
i
had
no
desire
to
go
to
constantinople
i
wished
to
remain
where
i
was
and
to
finish
what
i
had
begun
what
you
have
not
done
then
suddenly
and
with
an
abrupt
voice
exclaimed
the
bashaw
by
mahomet
a
man
of
a
reasonable
appetite
in
your
place
might
be
satisfied
have
not
you
filled
the
streets
with
riots
and
the
country
with
rebellion
do
not
the
populace
assemble
in
crowds
insulting
every
one
they
meet
and
talking
of
nothing
but
fire
and
devastation
the
bowstring
and
the
cimeter
be
so
good
my
dear
sir
as
to
inform
me
what
further
you
may
have
in
view
reverend
bashaw
cried
i
with
submission
yet
with
firmness
i
have
none
of
these
things
in
view
but
a
moment
ago
you
did
justice
to
my
intentions
they
are
those
of
beneficence
and
beneficence
i
know
nothing
about
that
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
honest
men
s
blunders
i
look
to
the
effects
they
these
effects
most
mighty
sir
are
temporary
they
are
the
clouds
that
will
often
obscure
for
an
instant
the
brightest
sunshine
condescend
to
lend
me
your
generous
assistance
and
all
will
be
do
not
tell
me
of
clouds
and
sunshine
this
is
to
my
thinking
not
an
april
shower
but
an
earthquake
and
a
hurricane
if
we
are
all
to
be
swallowed
up
or
whirled
into
the
air
it
is
no
consolation
to
me
that
the
day
after
we
are
gone
every
thing
shall
be
as
fair
and
serene
as
paradise
remember
sir
that
when
i
came
into
hungary
i
found
its
inhabitants
in
the
most
desperate
condition
miserable
wasted
and
starving
have
i
not
already
suspended
this
evil
for
months
yes
i
do
remember
you
are
one
of
those
who
never
see
an
evil
without
imagining
they
are
the
persons
to
correct
it
intruding
into
every
thing
and
subverting
every
thing
the
superintendence
of
the
public
welfare
is
a
mystery
to
which
none
are
competent
but
those
whom
mahomet
has
raised
to
the
situation
of
statesmen
your
interference
is
blasphemy
against
the
spirit
of
our
religion
and
deserves
to
be
encountered
with
the
most
exemplary
good
god
then
is
it
in
this
country
a
crime
to
feed
the
hungry
to
clothe
the
naked
and
shelter
the
houseless
sieur
de
chatillon
retorted
the
bashaw
you
appear
to
be
unacquainted
with
the
maxims
of
turkish
policy
the
wisest
and
most
beneficent
in
the
world
if
none
of
the
disturbances
had
happened
at
which
i
have
so
much
reason
to
be
alarmed
still
in
relieving
the
people
in
the
manner
you
have
done
you
have
incurred
the
guilt
of
high
treason
against
the
sultan
know
sir
that
through
the
whole
extent
of
his
dominions
there
is
but
one
proprietor
and
that
is
our
illustrious
monarch
you
say
that
you
wish
to
be
the
benefactor
of
his
subjects
and
the
judge
of
your
own
proceedings
such
sentiments
are
direct
rebellion
against
the
glorious
constitution
of
ottoman
the
sovereign
of
constantinople
will
have
no
benefactor
in
the
countries
he
presides
over
but
himself
like
the
invisible
ruler
of
the
universe
he
acts
by
second
causes
he
allows
his
ministers
to
be
the
instruments
of
his
beneficence
but
all
must
be
ascribed
to
him
must
flow
from
his
will
and
be
placed
under
his
control
you
who
have
formed
a
plan
of
public
benefit
without
consulting
him
and
have
presumed
like
a
luminary
of
the
world
to
move
in
an
orbit
of
your
own
have
in
strictness
of
construction
forfeited
your
life
to
his
justice
and
i
consult
rather
the
clemency
of
his
nature
than
the
maxims
of
his
policy
if
i
suffer
you
to
go
from
this
palace
with
your
head
upon
your
without
permitting
myself
to
be
too
much
moved
by
the
imperious
language
addressed
to
me
i
complained
to
the
bashaw
of
the
rigorous
and
arbitrary
character
of
what
he
stated
to
be
the
maxims
of
the
turkish
government
i
solemnly
protested
that
i
had
no
private
or
personal
object
in
view
the
effect
of
my
operations
would
be
to
give
new
strength
and
energy
to
his
master
s
dominions
by
diffusing
happiness
among
his
subjects
by
reviving
industry
and
scattering
plenty
prosperity
and
ease
all
disaffection
would
be
rooted
out
and
the
people
who
are
never
minute
in
scanning
the
cause
of
their
enjoyments
would
bless
the
sceptre
under
which
they
were
made
to
participate
such
manifold
benefits
if
the
policy
of
the
divan
led
them
in
any
degree
to
interfere
they
ought
rather
to
crown
my
measures
with
their
applause
than
wantonly
to
throw
obstacles
in
the
way
of
what
i
purposed
i
asked
however
no
reward
i
demanded
no
favour
for
myself
all
i
desired
was
that
the
sultan
would
assist
me
in
securing
to
his
people
those
benefits
the
dissemination
of
which
i
had
so
auspiciously
begun
the
bashaw
without
taking
any
direct
notice
of
this
expostulation
answered
that
i
was
not
aware
of
the
maxims
of
his
government
to
which
in
consideration
of
my
seeming
generosity
and
rectitude
he
was
willing
to
give
the
mildest
interpretation
it
is
however
continued
he
to
the
last
degree
idle
in
you
to
imagine
that
you
can
be
permitted
to
go
on
unobserved
and
that
the
sultan
and
his
representatives
are
to
take
no
account
of
your
proceeding
the
great
instrument
for
ruling
mankind
is
by
their
passions
and
their
opinions
the
man
from
whom
they
believe
they
have
the
most
to
fear
and
the
most
to
hope
will
always
be
their
master
whatever
be
your
secret
or
your
professed
designs
you
go
on
from
day
to
day
making
yourself
partisans
and
enlisting
the
subjects
of
the
sultan
among
your
personal
retainers
what
security
has
he
for
your
submission
and
loyalty
how
shall
he
know
that
when
you
have
acquired
the
advantages
of
a
powerful
leader
you
will
not
go
over
to
the
enemy
or
in
the
present
distracted
condition
of
the
province
even
have
the
audacity
to
set
up
for
yourself
if
therefore
by
an
unexampled
clemency
of
construction
i
decline
to
reduce
you
into
the
passive
machine
of
my
master
s
will
it
is
at
least
incumbent
on
me
that
i
should
take
account
of
your
powers
and
possess
myself
of
the
schedule
of
your
property
by
this
means
only
can
i
watch
your
progress
and
take
care
that
you
do
not
suddenly
become
too
powerful
for
a
subject
are
you
prepared
to
satisfy
me
on
this
head
on
this
question
i
hesitated
for
a
moment
i
had
not
exactly
anticipated
the
enquiry
at
length
i
requested
the
delay
of
a
few
days
and
then
i
promised
that
all
his
demands
should
be
satisfied
the
bashaw
resumed
sieur
de
chatillon
i
remark
your
hesitation
and
i
draw
from
it
no
favourable
augury
these
indirect
and
involuntary
indications
are
more
worthy
of
my
attention
than
all
the
studied
and
elaborate
information
you
shall
think
proper
to
give
me
sir
you
are
a
man
of
darkness
and
every
thing
that
relates
to
you
is
enveloped
in
mystery
you
come
hither
with
no
apparent
motive
you
have
no
connections
of
blood
in
hungary
you
have
no
acquaintance
with
any
eminent
person
of
the
hungarian
nation
i
have
had
my
spies
on
you
though
i
have
not
hitherto
thought
proper
to
summon
you
to
my
presence
you
have
purchased
no
property
in
the
province
i
can
not
learn
that
you
have
any
correspondences
or
resources
from
abroad
i
have
been
at
the
pains
to
procure
an
account
of
your
expenditure
during
the
three
months
you
have
resided
among
us
much
of
that
expenditure
has
been
obscure
clandestine
and
indirect
but
i
believe
you
will
find
my
estimate
which
you
are
at
liberty
to
inspect
and
remark
upon
tolerably
correct
your
disbursements
for
three
months
exceed
the
amount
of
two
years
income
of
the
richest
subject
that
even
the
credulous
monarchs
of
christendom
suffer
within
their
dominions
what
am
i
to
think
of
this
how
can
i
be
sufficiently
vigilant
respecting
a
man
whose
expenditure
is
immense
and
whose
wealth
can
neither
be
traced
to
its
source
nor
ascertained
in
its
amount
i
was
not
slow
in
conjecturing
the
result
which
the
bashaw
proposed
to
himself
from
our
present
conference
i
was
confirmed
in
my
conjecture
by
the
circumstance
of
his
choosing
that
the
discussion
between
us
should
be
apart
from
all
witnesses
he
regarded
me
as
a
boy
and
had
therefore
practised
upon
me
all
those
arts
which
might
most
effectually
excite
in
me
fear
and
alarm
he
found
however
that
under
the
external
indications
of
youth
and
inexperience
i
possessed
the
wariness
that
added
years
most
powerfully
inculcate
and
the
of
a
mind
thoroughly
awake
to
its
situation
and
its
resources
this
must
have
been
to
the
minister
before
whom
i
stood
a
memorable
phenomenon
but
curiosity
is
not
a
turkish
passion
and
the
single
object
of
the
bashaw
in
the
present
instance
was
to
make
the
mysteriousness
of
my
circumstances
a
pretext
for
extorting
money
i
submitted
with
as
little
seeming
reluctance
as
possible
to
the
necessity
of
the
case
i
requested
the
good
offices
of
muzaffer
to
protect
my
benefactions
and
begged
permission
to
make
him
the
compliment
of
a
handsome
sum
of
money
by
way
of
convincing
him
that
i
was
worthy
of
his
friendship
this
business
was
easily
adjusted
between
us
i
found
him
perfectly
skilled
in
the
duties
of
a
public
office
and
by
no
means
under
the
dominion
of
visionary
scruples
he
told
me
he
was
now
convinced
that
i
was
a
well
meaning
man
and
a
good
subject
he
said
that
nothing
could
tend
more
effectually
to
demonstrate
my
innocence
than
my
showing
that
i
understood
the
duties
and
concerns
of
a
minister
of
state
and
that
for
his
own
part
he
was
never
so
happy
as
when
he
was
thus
able
to
reconcile
his
private
interests
with
the
good
and
faithful
service
of
his
master
there
was
nothing
that
demanded
a
more
unremitted
vigilance
or
a
more
skilful
management
than
such
a
situation
as
his
and
it
would
be
most
unreasonable
either
in
the
sovereign
that
appointed
him
or
the
subjects
over
whom
he
was
placed
to
expect
him
to
be
indifferent
to
the
emoluments
and
perquisites
of
his
function
he
complimented
me
warmly
upon
the
disinterestedness
and
liberality
of
my
exertions
he
thought
himself
particularly
fortunate
in
having
so
an
individual
within
the
circuit
of
his
jurisdiction
in
fine
he
hoped
he
should
be
honoured
with
my
personal
acquaintance
and
assured
me
that
nothing
could
make
him
more
happy
than
the
frequent
repetition
of
my
visits
we
now
perfectly
understood
one
another
and
it
was
apparent
that
i
had
to
do
with
a
man
who
for
what
he
deemed
an
adequate
consideration
would
willingly
lend
me
the
authority
and
countenance
of
his
office
and
suffer
me
to
guide
him
in
any
of
the
functions
i
might
conceive
necessary
for
the
execution
of
my
projects
guards
were
agreed
to
be
placed
upon
the
magazines
where
corn
was
still
contained
and
from
place
to
place
on
the
banks
of
the
rivers
where
the
depredations
of
a
misguided
populace
were
most
to
be
apprehended
finding
the
bashaw
so
perfectly
willing
to
comply
with
my
requisitions
i
further
obtained
from
him
the
direction
of
several
squadrons
of
cavalry
for
the
protection
of
the
crops
which
from
the
consequences
of
my
interference
now
began
on
all
sides
to
variegate
the
scene
this
was
a
most
important
service
when
the
corn
was
first
committed
to
the
earth
it
was
out
of
the
reach
of
military
devastation
but
as
time
glided
silently
on
the
case
became
materially
altered
the
enemy
might
from
forecast
desire
to
reap
the
harvest
of
what
he
had
not
sown
or
from
malice
to
destroy
that
without
which
the
turk
would
perhaps
be
unable
to
retain
his
newly
acquired
territory
this
had
in
reality
been
the
principal
cause
before
my
arrival
in
hungary
of
the
very
general
neglect
into
which
agriculture
had
fallen
muzaffer
than
whom
no
person
could
now
be
more
polite
and
condescending
allowed
me
to
determine
the
number
and
nature
of
the
troops
i
required
and
added
that
though
he
could
not
openly
put
them
under
my
direction
the
slightest
intimation
i
might
think
proper
to
convey
to
him
should
at
any
time
decide
their
march
and
regulate
their
quarters
chapter
xxxvii
in
my
conference
with
the
bashaw
i
may
seem
to
have
secured
more
than
one
point
of
material
importance
yet
it
was
difficult
for
any
man
to
be
in
a
state
less
consolatory
or
more
full
of
danger
and
menace
than
i
was
at
this
moment
by
my
vigilance
and
the
power
which
thus
i
had
acquired
i
prevented
indeed
the
inhabitants
from
wantonly
destroying
the
means
of
their
own
subsistence
but
the
more
i
was
their
benefactor
the
more
i
appeared
to
become
odious
to
their
thoughts
my
negotiation
with
the
bashaw
whatever
other
benefit
might
accrue
from
it
did
not
tend
to
increase
the
resources
of
the
country
i
was
obliged
to
witness
many
scenes
of
wretchedness
he
that
would
assist
mankind
in
their
adversity
must
harden
his
heart
to
be
the
spectator
of
the
distress
that
he
can
and
that
he
can
not
relieve
but
whatever
i
beheld
of
this
sort
the
majority
of
the
bystanders
obstinately
persisted
to
ascribe
to
my
deliberate
malignity
the
military
aid
i
found
myself
necessitated
to
introduce
by
no
means
tended
to
disarm
the
prejudices
of
my
clients
in
one
or
two
instances
but
no
more
slight
tumults
arose
and
a
few
of
the
rioters
fell
a
prey
to
their
own
wickedness
and
folly
these
misfortunes
were
cast
as
reproach
upon
me
and
i
was
pursued
with
clamours
and
curses
i
found
it
requisite
to
obtain
a
guard
for
my
person
i
was
abhorred
by
those
for
whom
all
my
vigilance
was
exerted
and
insulted
by
the
mouths
that
i
supplied
with
the
necessaries
of
existence
nor
was
this
my
only
source
of
alarm
and
uneasiness
in
my
present
situation
i
was
by
no
means
a
dupe
to
the
ostentatious
civility
of
the
bashaw
i
perfectly
understood
his
insinuation
when
he
invited
the
frequent
repetition
of
my
visits
i
knew
that
however
dearly
i
purchased
his
friendship
and
patronage
i
should
still
have
to
purchase
them
again
and
again
his
extortions
upon
me
admitted
of
no
limits
except
from
his
own
modesty
or
the
estimate
he
might
form
of
my
invisible
resources
bribery
itself
afforded
me
no
complete
security
and
now
that
i
had
become
an
object
of
curiosity
and
remark
he
had
sufficiently
shown
me
i
was
at
the
mercy
of
his
caprice
or
that
of
his
master
for
my
liberty
and
even
for
my
life
yet
could
i
have
resolved
to
quit
hungary
and
seek
the
protection
of
some
more
regular
government
what
benefit
should
i
derive
from
a
removal
mystery
was
the
great
and
unconquerable
bane
of
my
situation
and
from
the
poisonous
influence
of
mystery
the
most
regular
system
of
government
was
not
competent
to
protect
me
it
would
be
idle
to
imagine
that
in
any
country
on
earth
a
stranger
would
be
permitted
to
launch
into
such
expenses
as
those
in
which
i
was
engaged
without
becoming
an
object
of
suspicion
and
being
made
liable
to
continual
interruption
in
his
measures
yet
unless
allowed
to
use
the
resources
i
possessed
of
what
advantage
was
it
to
be
the
depository
of
wealth
without
a
bound
was
it
to
be
wished
for
a
man
under
my
circumstances
to
have
a
family
or
to
be
without
a
family
when
i
had
one
i
found
the
legacy
of
the
stranger
robbing
me
of
every
comfort
of
that
sort
with
the
most
calamitous
aggravations
when
i
was
stripped
of
wife
and
children
though
no
man
could
prize
those
benefits
more
dearly
than
i
prized
them
i
took
to
myself
the
consolation
that
at
least
now
i
should
risk
no
one
s
happiness
but
my
own
and
that
for
a
person
exercising
my
endowments
it
was
perhaps
requisite
to
be
free
from
every
shackle
and
incumbrance
i
found
however
the
topic
from
which
i
had
consoled
myself
in
reality
the
source
of
a
new
misfortune
i
had
the
wealth
of
a
nobleman
but
i
was
deprived
of
his
adventitious
attributes
i
had
no
illustrious
ancestry
to
boast
i
had
neither
lineage
nor
parent
i
had
neither
wife
nor
children
in
whom
mutually
to
reflect
and
see
reflected
the
elevatedness
and
generosity
of
my
station
i
had
not
even
the
ordinary
advantage
which
is
within
the
reach
of
almost
every
man
of
connections
and
acquaintance
friends
handed
down
to
me
as
a
branch
of
my
patrimonial
inheritance
friends
whose
value
experience
enabled
me
to
ascertain
and
friends
with
whom
long
habits
of
familiarity
had
given
birth
to
reciprocal
endearment
the
bashaw
had
imputed
to
me
the
design
of
forming
a
party
alas
these
which
are
the
great
materials
for
cementing
party
attachments
were
totally
denied
me
i
had
no
bonds
of
alliance
but
those
which
money
afforded
the
coarsest
the
meanest
the
least
flattering
and
the
most
brittle
of
those
ligatures
that
afford
the
semblance
of
uniting
man
with
man
chapter
xxxviii
aware
of
the
difficulties
which
unavoidably
sprung
out
of
the
nature
of
my
situation
i
resolved
immediately
to
endeavour
to
supply
them
to
the
best
of
my
power
i
conceived
that
there
was
no
consideration
so
urgent
upon
me
at
the
present
moment
as
that
i
should
without
loss
of
time
create
to
myself
connections
that
might
balance
and
keep
at
bay
the
sallies
of
arbitrary
rule
and
that
i
should
weave
with
my
own
hand
the
cords
of
friendship
i
had
no
sooner
formed
this
project
than
an
individual
suggested
himself
to
my
reflections
whom
i
judged
to
be
by
a
singular
concurrence
of
circumstances
happily
fitted
to
be
the
subject
of
my
experiment
and
admirably
qualified
to
afford
me
protection
in
the
most
unfavourable
events
the
name
of
this
man
was
bethlem
gabor
he
had
been
some
time
before
brought
to
me
by
one
of
his
friends
and
he
was
a
man
whom
for
a
thousand
reasons
it
was
impossible
to
see
and
converse
with
without
receiving
the
most
indelible
impression
he
was
the
lineal
representative
of
one
of
the
most
illustrious
houses
in
hungary
his
vocation
like
that
of
the
majority
of
the
hungarian
nobility
had
been
arms
but
in
the
midst
of
a
fraternity
all
of
whom
were
warlike
he
stood
conspicuous
and
alone
his
courage
though
cool
and
deliberate
almost
mounted
to
a
degree
of
desperate
rashness
and
the
fertility
of
his
invention
and
the
variety
of
his
stratagems
did
not
fall
short
of
his
courage
the
celerity
of
his
measures
was
equally
distinguished
distance
was
no
bar
to
him
and
he
had
no
sooner
conceived
a
project
however
arduous
than
it
was
executed
he
had
formed
under
his
own
eye
a
band
of
men
like
himself
impetuous
yet
deliberate
swift
in
execution
silent
in
march
invincible
to
hardship
contemners
of
fatigue
of
difficulties
of
hunger
and
of
thirst
when
introduced
to
me
he
was
upwards
of
fifty
years
of
age
he
was
more
than
six
feet
in
stature
and
yet
he
was
built
as
if
it
had
been
a
colossus
destined
to
sustain
the
weight
of
the
starry
heavens
his
voice
was
like
thunder
and
he
never
uttered
a
word
but
it
seemed
to
shake
his
manly
chest
his
head
and
chin
were
clothed
with
a
thick
and
shaggy
hair
in
colour
a
dead
black
he
had
suffered
considerable
mutilation
in
the
services
through
which
he
had
passed
of
one
of
his
hands
three
fingers
were
gone
the
sight
of
his
right
eye
was
extinguished
and
the
cheek
half
shot
away
while
the
same
explosion
had
burned
his
complexion
into
a
colour
that
was
universally
dun
or
black
his
nose
was
scarred
and
his
lips
were
thick
and
large
bethlem
gabor
though
universally
respected
for
the
honour
and
magnanimity
of
a
soldier
was
not
less
remarkable
for
habits
of
reserve
and
taciturnity
but
these
habits
misfortune
had
caused
to
become
more
deeply
ingrafted
in
his
nature
during
one
of
his
military
excursions
a
party
of
marauders
had
in
his
absence
surprised
his
castle
burned
it
to
the
ground
and
savagely
murdered
his
wife
and
children
and
every
living
creature
within
the
walls
the
same
stroke
that
rendered
him
childless
made
him
also
a
beggar
he
had
been
regarded
for
his
proceedings
as
an
adherent
to
the
turkish
standard
but
he
had
always
tenaciously
maintained
the
most
complete
independence
the
adversity
that
had
now
fallen
upon
him
was
too
great
he
would
not
become
a
pensioner
of
the
sultan
despair
had
taken
fast
possession
of
his
heart
he
disbanded
the
body
of
men
he
had
formed
and
wandered
a
solitary
outcast
upon
the
face
of
his
country
for
some
time
he
seemed
to
have
a
savage
complacence
in
conceiving
that
the
evil
he
had
suffered
was
past
all
remedy
and
in
spurning
at
those
palliations
and
disguises
with
which
vulgar
souls
are
accustomed
to
assuage
their
woe
yet
the
energy
of
his
nature
would
not
suffer
him
to
rest
he
wandered
an
outcast
but
every
day
engendered
some
new
thought
or
passion
and
it
appeared
probable
that
he
would
not
yet
quit
the
stage
of
existence
till
he
had
left
behind
him
the
remembrances
of
a
terrible
and
desolating
revenge
it
may
seem
strange
that
such
a
man
as
i
have
described
should
be
the
individual
i
selected
out
of
the
whole
hungarian
nation
to
make
my
friend
it
may
seem
that
his
qualities
were
better
adapted
to
repel
than
attract
my
choice
would
not
appear
strange
if
the
reader
could
have
conversed
with
him
as
i
did
he
was
hideous
to
the
sight
and
he
never
addressed
himself
to
speak
that
i
did
not
feel
my
very
heart
shudder
within
me
seldom
did
he
allow
himself
to
open
his
thoughts
but
when
he
did
great
god
what
supernatural
eloquence
seemed
to
inspire
and
enshroud
him
not
that
upon
such
occasions
he
was
copious
and
ciceronian
but
that
every
muscle
and
every
limb
seemed
to
live
and
to
quiver
with
the
thoughts
he
expressed
the
hearer
could
not
refuse
to
venerate
as
well
as
fear
him
i
never
pitied
him
bethlem
gabor
s
was
a
soul
that
soared
to
a
sightless
distance
above
the
sphere
of
pity
i
can
scarcely
say
i
sympathised
with
him
but
when
i
listened
to
his
complaints
rather
let
me
say
his
invectives
i
was
astonished
overwhelmed
and
motionless
the
secret
of
the
effects
he
thus
produced
lay
in
his
own
way
of
feeling
the
incidents
he
described
look
at
him
when
he
sat
alone
wrapped
in
meditation
you
would
say
that
is
a
man
of
iron
though
adversity
pour
her
fiercest
darts
upon
him
he
is
invulnerable
he
is
of
too
colossal
a
structure
to
be
accessible
to
human
feelings
and
human
listen
to
his
narrative
or
rather
to
the
bursts
of
passion
which
with
him
supplied
the
place
and
performed
the
functions
of
narrative
you
would
soon
confess
your
mistake
while
he
spoke
he
ceased
to
be
a
man
and
became
something
more
amazing
when
he
alluded
to
what
he
had
endured
you
did
not
compassionate
him
for
you
felt
that
he
was
a
creature
of
another
nature
but
you
confessed
that
never
man
seemed
to
have
suffered
so
much
or
to
savour
with
such
bitterness
the
cup
of
woe
he
did
not
love
his
wife
or
his
children
as
any
other
man
would
do
he
probably
never
dandled
or
fondled
them
his
love
was
speechless
and
disdaining
the
common
modes
of
exhibition
it
might
sometimes
be
mistaken
for
indifference
but
it
brooded
over
and
clung
round
his
heart
and
when
it
was
disturbed
when
the
strong
ties
of
domestic
charity
were
by
the
merciless
hand
of
war
snapped
asunder
you
then
saw
its
voluminous
folds
spread
and
convulsed
before
you
gigantic
and
immeasurable
he
cursed
their
murderers
he
cursed
mankind
he
rose
up
in
fierce
defiance
of
eternal
providence
and
your
blood
curdled
within
you
as
he
spoke
such
was
bethlem
gabor
i
could
not
help
admiring
him
his
greatness
excited
my
wonder
and
my
reverence
and
while
his
manners
awed
and
overwhelmed
me
i
felt
an
inexplicable
attachment
to
his
person
still
increasing
in
my
bosom
on
his
part
my
kindness
and
partiality
appeared
scarcely
less
pleasing
to
bethlem
gabor
than
his
character
and
discourse
were
fascinating
to
me
he
had
found
himself
without
a
confidant
or
a
friend
his
wife
and
his
children
in
a
certain
degree
understood
him
and
though
he
had
an
atmosphere
of
repulsion
beyond
which
no
mortal
ever
penetrated
they
came
to
the
edge
of
that
and
rested
there
they
trembled
involuntarily
at
his
aspect
but
at
the
same
time
they
adored
and
they
loved
him
the
rest
of
the
world
viewed
him
from
a
more
fearful
distance
respected
him
but
dared
not
even
in
fancy
be
familiar
with
him
when
therefore
he
lost
his
family
he
lost
his
all
he
roamed
the
earth
in
solitude
and
all
men
made
room
for
him
as
he
passed
i
was
the
first
who
since
the
fatal
event
that
had
made
him
childless
and
a
beggar
had
courted
his
society
and
invited
his
communications
i
had
dared
to
take
the
lion
by
the
paw
and
seat
myself
next
him
in
his
den
there
was
a
similarity
in
our
fortunes
that
secretly
endeared
him
to
me
we
had
each
by
the
malice
of
a
hostile
destiny
though
in
a
very
different
manner
been
deprived
of
our
families
we
were
each
of
us
alone
fated
each
to
be
hereafter
for
ever
alone
we
blended
ourselves
the
one
with
the
other
as
perfectly
as
we
could
often
over
our
gloomy
bowl
we
mingled
groans
and
sweetened
our
draught
as
we
drank
it
with
maledictions
in
the
school
of
bethlem
gabor
i
became
acquainted
with
the
delights
of
melancholy
of
a
melancholy
not
that
contracted
but
that
swelled
the
soul
of
a
melancholy
that
looked
down
upon
the
world
with
indignation
and
that
relieved
its
secret
load
with
curses
and
execrations
we
frequently
continued
whole
nights
in
the
participation
of
these
bitter
joys
and
were
surprised
still
at
our
serious
board
by
the
light
of
the
morrow
s
sun
i
have
now
i
believe
fully
accounted
for
our
intimacy
and
displayed
the
ligatures
that
secretly
bound
us
to
each
other
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
add
that
my
understanding
confirmed
what
my
heart
impelled
bethlem
gabor
appeared
to
me
the
fittest
man
in
the
world
upon
whom
to
fix
for
my
friend
we
were
qualified
mutually
to
benefit
each
other
my
kindness
my
unremitted
attentions
the
earnestness
with
which
i
listened
to
and
soothed
his
griefs
mitigated
their
agony
i
proposed
when
i
could
once
more
reconcile
and
incite
him
to
activity
to
repair
his
castle
and
restore
his
fortune
on
the
other
hand
he
was
of
all
the
persons
i
could
have
pitched
upon
the
ablest
to
protect
me
by
his
birth
he
ranked
among
the
first
men
of
his
country
by
his
ability
at
least
as
a
partisan
soldier
a
character
at
that
time
highly
esteemed
he
rose
above
them
all
for
some
time
i
regarded
bethlem
gabor
as
entirely
my
friend
and
i
consulted
him
in
every
thing
in
which
compatibly
with
the
legacy
of
the
stranger
of
the
i
could
consult
him
i
told
him
of
the
suspicions
of
the
bashaw
and
the
precariousness
of
my
safety
i
demanded
his
advice
as
to
the
best
method
of
securing
it
ought
i
to
regard
it
as
a
more
effectual
or
as
a
cheaper
expedient
to
attempt
to
purchase
the
countenance
of
the
sultan
instead
of
condescending
to
bribe
his
minister
ought
i
to
set
up
for
myself
and
by
rendering
myself
the
independent
prince
of
one
of
the
hungarian
provinces
defy
the
turk
or
at
least
endeavour
to
negotiate
with
him
from
a
more
respectable
and
commanding
situation
i
said
more
than
enough
under
these
heads
as
it
afterwards
appeared
to
awaken
strange
imaginations
in
a
mind
of
so
much
penetration
as
that
of
bethlem
gabor
in
fine
i
demanded
of
him
whether
in
case
of
any
great
and
formidable
danger
falling
on
me
he
would
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
afford
me
protection
when
the
question
was
first
started
he
swore
to
me
with
his
customary
impressiveness
and
energy
that
he
would
while
i
was
thus
employed
in
consulting
him
and
opening
to
him
as
far
as
was
practicable
my
prospects
and
fears
i
did
not
less
succeed
in
dissipating
or
suspending
the
despair
of
his
melancholy
it
was
of
benefit
to
him
in
this
respect
that
by
opening
to
him
my
affairs
i
from
time
to
time
called
off
his
attention
from
his
personal
misfortunes
i
proposed
to
him
the
rebuilding
his
castle
and
i
at
length
obtained
his
permission
to
send
off
a
corps
of
workmen
for
that
purpose
beside
the
castle
in
which
his
wife
and
children
had
been
murdered
and
which
the
marauders
had
nearly
destroyed
he
had
one
considerably
stronger
though
void
of
all
recommendation
from
cheerfulness
or
beauty
in
the
more
northerly
part
of
the
kingdom
this
we
visited
together
i
restored
the
condition
of
his
fields
with
considerable
difficulty
i
replaced
the
cattle
he
had
lost
by
purchases
in
poland
and
i
revived
his
dilapidated
revenues
at
first
he
felt
an
invincible
repugnance
to
the
receiving
any
advantage
from
the
bounty
of
another
but
by
continual
remonstrances
i
was
able
to
persuade
him
that
he
owed
me
nothing
and
that
what
i
did
was
no
more
than
was
required
from
me
by
a
regard
for
my
own
safety
if
ever
on
the
face
of
the
earth
there
lived
a
misanthrope
bethlem
gabor
was
the
man
never
for
a
moment
did
he
forget
or
forgive
the
sanguinary
catastrophe
of
his
family
and
for
his
own
misfortunes
he
seemed
to
have
vowed
vengeance
against
the
whole
human
race
he
almost
hated
the
very
face
of
man
and
when
expressions
of
cheerfulness
peace
and
contentment
discovered
themselves
in
his
presence
i
could
see
by
the
hideous
working
of
his
features
that
his
spirit
experienced
intolerable
agonies
to
him
such
expressions
were
tones
horribly
discordant
all
was
uproar
and
havoc
within
his
own
bosom
and
the
gaiety
of
other
men
inspired
him
with
sentiments
of
invincible
antipathy
he
never
saw
a
festive
board
without
an
inclination
to
overturn
it
or
a
father
encircled
with
a
smiling
family
without
feeling
his
soul
thrill
with
suggestions
of
murder
something
i
know
not
what
withheld
his
hand
it
might
be
some
remaining
atom
of
humanity
it
might
be
for
his
whole
character
was
contemplative
and
close
it
might
be
that
he
regarded
that
as
a
pitiful
and
impotent
revenge
which
should
cause
him
the
next
hour
to
be
locked
up
as
a
madman
or
put
to
death
as
criminal
horrible
as
was
his
personal
aspect
and
wild
and
savage
as
was
his
mind
yet
as
i
have
already
said
i
felt
myself
attached
to
him
i
knew
that
all
the
unsocial
propensities
that
animated
him
were
the
offspring
of
love
were
the
sentiments
of
a
lioness
bereaved
of
her
young
and
i
found
an
undescribable
and
exhaustless
pleasure
in
examining
the
sublime
desolation
of
a
mighty
soul
bethlem
gabor
had
at
first
regarded
me
with
some
degree
of
partiality
kindness
in
almost
all
cases
begets
kindness
he
could
not
see
how
much
i
interested
myself
about
and
how
much
i
courted
him
without
feeling
for
me
a
sentiment
different
from
that
he
confessed
for
other
men
i
saw
however
after
some
time
with
inexpressible
grief
that
his
regard
for
me
instead
of
increasing
suffered
perceptible
diminution
our
propensities
were
opposed
to
each
other
he
rejoiced
in
disorder
and
desolation
as
in
his
congenial
element
my
present
pursuit
was
the
restoration
of
public
order
and
prosperity
he
repeatedly
expostulated
with
me
on
this
i
had
sometimes
in
our
conversations
in
the
bitterness
of
my
recollections
exclaimed
on
myself
as
the
most
unfortunate
and
most
persecuted
of
men
though
without
entering
into
an
explanation
of
my
sufferings
he
reminded
me
of
these
exclamations
he
reproached
me
as
a
contemptible
and
pusillanimous
wretch
that
i
did
not
like
him
resolve
amply
and
memorably
to
revenge
my
own
sufferings
upon
my
species
at
large
in
his
estimate
the
poorest
and
most
servile
of
all
maxims
was
that
of
the
author
of
the
christian
religion
to
repay
injury
with
favour
and
curses
with
benediction
i
perceived
with
grief
that
the
kindness
towards
me
that
had
been
excited
in
bethlem
gabor
s
mind
rather
declined
than
augmented
but
i
was
very
far
from
being
aware
of
the
degree
in
which
as
i
afterwards
found
this
sentiment
had
relapsed
into
its
opposite
it
seems
i
inflicted
on
him
a
daily
torture
by
my
daily
efforts
for
the
dissemination
of
happiness
of
these
he
had
not
been
at
first
completely
aware
his
mind
had
been
too
much
absorbed
in
its
own
feelings
to
attend
very
distinctly
to
any
thing
i
did
unless
it
were
done
in
his
presence
but
in
proportion
as
i
soothed
his
sorrows
and
made
him
my
confidant
the
film
was
removed
and
all
that
he
saw
had
the
peculiar
misfortune
to
excite
at
once
his
contempt
and
his
rage
the
finishing
stroke
that
i
gave
to
the
animosity
which
unknown
to
me
was
now
brooding
and
engendering
in
his
breast
consisted
in
my
bestowing
an
important
benefit
upon
one
against
whom
he
had
entertained
a
long
and
eternal
feud
chapter
xxxix
while
bethlem
gabor
became
every
day
more
confirmed
in
his
antipathy
against
me
i
reposed
in
him
an
unsuspecting
confidence
a
confidence
more
extensive
than
i
had
since
the
singular
and
fatal
acquisition
i
had
made
reposed
in
any
other
man
frequently
for
a
considerable
time
together
he
resided
under
my
roof
frequently
we
went
forth
together
in
those
excursions
which
either
my
projects
or
his
views
rendered
it
necessary
for
us
to
make
in
his
character
of
a
nobleman
of
great
consideration
in
his
native
country
he
was
now
rising
like
a
phœnix
from
its
ashes
his
castles
were
repairing
his
property
was
restored
the
list
of
his
retainers
daily
became
more
numerous
he
revived
and
carefully
recruited
the
martial
band
which
in
the
first
exacerbations
of
his
despair
he
had
dismissed
from
his
service
my
purse
and
all
that
i
had
were
his
he
never
made
a
demand
upon
me
that
i
did
not
instantly
supply
i
reaped
a
particular
pleasure
from
the
largeness
and
frequency
of
his
requisitions
there
was
nothing
for
which
i
was
more
anxious
than
to
bind
him
to
me
in
indissoluble
ties
of
gratitude
and
affection
little
alas
did
i
understand
the
compound
of
tenderness
and
ferocity
of
decisiveness
and
inscrutability
with
which
i
was
now
concerned
my
friend
such
i
esteemed
him
had
been
absent
some
time
i
expected
his
return
to
my
residence
at
buda
and
anxious
to
pay
him
every
mark
of
attention
and
respect
i
set
out
to
meet
him
it
was
scarcely
safe
during
the
existing
hostilities
between
the
austrians
and
the
turks
to
travel
any
where
without
a
guard
i
had
the
precaution
in
the
present
instance
to
take
with
me
an
attendance
of
twenty
men
it
was
after
having
partaken
of
a
slight
and
early
dinner
that
i
set
out
on
my
excursion
the
season
was
remarkably
fine
and
the
air
genial
and
balsamic
i
scarcely
ever
commenced
any
tour
with
more
agreeable
sensations
the
harvest
was
already
ripe
and
as
i
passed
along
i
saw
reapers
from
time
to
time
entering
upon
the
first
essay
of
their
interesting
occupation
i
felt
that
i
had
at
length
surmounted
one
of
those
difficulties
with
which
i
had
been
so
strongly
assailed
and
to
which
i
had
refused
to
yield
if
i
were
not
free
from
apprehensions
from
the
arbitrary
nature
of
the
government
under
which
i
lived
i
believed
however
that
i
had
nothing
further
to
dread
from
the
misconstruction
and
animosity
of
the
nation
i
preserved
my
anxiety
as
to
whether
i
should
be
able
to
substantiate
the
benefit
i
had
sought
to
confer
was
at
an
end
and
i
had
little
doubt
that
with
the
plenteous
crops
which
were
on
the
point
of
being
gathered
my
popularity
would
return
and
the
gratitude
of
my
clients
become
more
ardent
than
ever
it
was
a
delicious
enjoyment
that
i
now
experienced
the
pleasures
that
the
eye
unavoidably
takes
in
from
the
spectacle
of
a
luxuriant
autumn
became
blended
in
my
mind
with
the
ideas
of
famine
put
to
flight
my
own
rectitude
vindicated
and
the
benevolent
purposes
realised
the
prosecution
of
which
had
cost
me
so
profound
a
heartache
we
at
length
passed
the
lines
of
the
soldiers
planted
for
the
defence
of
the
soil
against
the
depredations
of
the
enemy
i
had
calculated
that
i
should
meet
my
guest
a
few
leagues
from
buda
i
was
deceived
in
my
estimate
the
day
however
of
his
arrival
was
fixed
i
could
not
be
mistaken
in
his
route
i
resolved
not
to
turn
back
without
meeting
him
the
road
i
took
led
upon
the
borders
of
that
part
of
hungary
which
owned
the
austrian
yoke
the
shades
of
night
were
fast
gathering
round
us
and
we
heard
at
a
distance
the
and
the
drums
of
the
enemy
i
was
not
however
a
novice
in
the
appearances
of
a
country
the
seat
of
military
excursions
and
war
and
if
my
mind
were
not
wholly
free
from
perturbation
and
uncertainty
i
at
least
resolved
not
to
be
turned
aside
from
my
purpose
we
travelled
two
hours
longer
still
no
notice
of
the
approach
of
bethlem
gabor
at
length
a
question
was
started
whether
we
were
still
in
the
right
road
and
i
thought
it
advisable
to
hold
a
sort
of
council
of
war
to
deliberate
respecting
our
further
proceedings
having
assembled
my
attendants
for
that
purpose
i
was
now
first
struck
with
the
apprehensions
and
timidity
which
they
unanimously
betrayed
they
had
been
drawn
out
rather
for
show
and
to
keep
accidental
stragglers
in
awe
than
with
the
expectation
of
actual
service
i
became
sensible
that
nothing
was
to
be
hoped
from
their
resistance
in
the
event
of
an
action
and
the
utmost
i
could
aim
at
was
in
the
mean
time
to
hold
them
together
by
the
sentiment
of
a
common
danger
it
was
resolved
to
return
i
began
to
be
apprehensive
that
bethlem
gabor
had
been
prevented
by
some
unexpected
occurrence
from
observing
his
appointment
scarcely
had
we
faced
about
before
we
heard
a
body
of
cavalry
approaching
us
i
called
to
my
party
to
halt
i
soon
discerned
from
symptoms
not
difficult
to
be
remarked
by
a
careful
observer
that
the
party
at
hand
was
composed
of
we
had
every
thing
to
fear
from
them
i
held
myself
bound
under
these
circumstances
first
to
make
experiment
of
the
fleetness
of
our
horses
i
however
charged
my
people
to
keep
together
and
not
to
suffer
the
enemy
by
means
of
our
inadvertence
and
folly
to
make
an
easy
prize
of
us
one
after
another
in
a
short
time
i
found
that
our
pursuers
sensibly
gained
ground
upon
us
i
was
mounted
upon
an
excellent
beast
and
could
easily
have
rode
away
from
my
troop
while
they
would
have
been
placed
as
a
sort
of
intercepting
object
between
me
and
the
enemy
but
i
had
too
much
of
a
military
spirit
not
instantly
to
reject
so
inglorious
an
expedient
i
called
a
second
time
to
my
attendants
to
halt
i
judged
that
the
party
of
our
antagonists
was
less
numerous
than
ours
i
was
convinced
that
our
common
safety
depended
upon
our
concerted
resistance
filled
with
the
gallantry
that
my
situation
inspired
i
did
not
perceive
till
it
was
too
late
that
my
present
call
to
halt
was
attended
to
by
few
even
those
few
rather
hung
back
divided
between
apprehension
and
shame
i
was
the
foremost
and
before
i
was
aware
i
found
myself
through
the
means
of
the
darkness
enveloped
by
the
enemy
from
my
appearance
they
judged
that
i
was
the
master
and
the
rest
my
attendants
they
contented
themselves
therefore
with
the
prize
they
had
made
and
did
not
give
themselves
the
trouble
to
pursue
the
fugitives
they
eagerly
enquired
of
me
who
i
was
and
comparing
my
answers
with
various
circumstances
which
rumour
had
brought
to
their
ear
they
easily
concluded
that
i
was
the
rich
stranger
of
buda
the
character
they
had
heard
of
me
did
not
produce
in
these
freebooters
any
sentiments
of
forbearance
or
demonstrations
of
respect
the
only
point
about
which
persons
of
their
habits
were
concerned
was
how
they
should
make
the
greatest
advantage
of
what
the
fortune
of
war
had
thrown
in
their
way
while
they
were
consulting
and
various
expedients
were
started
by
one
and
another
for
this
purpose
a
second
alarm
was
given
and
one
of
the
party
being
despatched
to
reconnoitre
presently
returned
with
intelligence
that
the
persons
approaching
were
horsemen
of
the
enemy
and
that
they
amounted
as
he
guessed
to
forty
in
number
upon
this
information
the
party
whose
prisoner
i
was
agreed
to
return
with
all
expedition
by
the
way
they
had
come
and
commanded
me
upon
pain
of
death
to
proceed
in
their
company
this
menace
had
not
the
effect
to
deprive
me
of
courage
or
presence
of
mind
and
i
easily
conceived
that
the
readiest
way
to
deliver
myself
from
my
embarrassment
would
be
to
join
at
the
first
opportunity
the
band
of
whose
approach
had
occasioned
our
sudden
retreat
the
darkness
of
the
night
was
favourable
to
my
purpose
and
taking
advantage
of
a
sudden
winding
in
the
road
i
slackened
all
at
once
the
pace
of
my
horse
without
being
observed
by
my
companions
who
as
the
enemy
approached
had
now
their
thoughts
almost
wholly
intent
upon
the
safety
of
their
retreat
they
passed
me
and
i
no
sooner
perceived
that
to
be
the
case
than
covered
from
their
observation
by
the
intervening
inclosure
i
turned
my
horse
and
gradually
as
my
distance
from
my
keepers
increased
urged
him
to
a
fuller
speed
it
was
not
long
before
i
came
up
with
the
band
which
had
produced
our
alarm
and
hailing
them
with
the
acclamation
long
live
the
mighty
sultan
was
without
difficulty
admitted
into
their
troop
i
instantly
understood
to
my
great
joy
that
this
was
the
party
of
bethlem
gabor
that
i
had
come
out
to
meet
he
received
me
with
much
cordiality
and
seemed
greatly
rejoiced
that
fortune
had
made
him
the
instrument
of
my
rescue
he
proposed
however
that
having
met
on
the
road
i
should
now
instead
of
proceeding
to
buda
return
with
him
to
his
northern
castle
from
which
our
distance
was
scarcely
greater
than
from
the
metropolis
the
proposal
was
such
as
i
had
not
expected
nor
could
i
well
comprehend
the
purpose
with
which
it
was
made
but
the
habitual
demeanour
of
bethlem
gabor
neither
accorded
with
his
minutely
assigning
a
reason
for
what
he
did
nor
was
calculated
to
encourage
enquiry
in
another
i
saw
no
material
objection
and
therefore
felt
little
scruple
in
yielding
to
his
desires
our
brief
consultation
on
this
point
passed
at
some
little
distance
from
the
rest
of
the
troop
when
the
morning
broke
the
first
thing
that
excited
my
attention
was
the
appearance
of
his
followers
they
were
full
forty
in
number
well
mounted
of
a
large
and
athletic
figure
with
faces
immense
whiskers
and
a
ferocious
countenance
i
thought
i
had
never
seen
so
tremendous
a
band
to
me
they
were
every
one
of
them
strangers
of
all
the
persons
that
surrounded
me
the
only
one
of
whom
i
had
the
slightest
knowledge
was
bethlem
gabor
himself
i
know
not
why
it
was
but
i
no
sooner
beheld
my
situation
than
i
was
struck
with
alarm
i
saw
myself
completely
in
the
power
of
a
man
who
three
months
before
was
ignorant
even
of
my
existence
i
had
not
a
single
attendant
of
my
own
not
an
individual
with
me
over
whom
i
had
personal
authority
or
command
i
had
no
reason
to
distrust
my
host
towards
me
his
demeanour
had
ever
been
frank
confidential
and
manly
i
had
every
imaginable
claim
upon
his
generosity
and
his
gratitude
but
our
senses
are
often
the
masters
of
our
mind
and
reason
vainly
opposes
itself
to
the
liveliness
of
their
impressions
every
time
that
i
lifted
my
eyes
and
saw
myself
hemmed
in
by
these
barbarians
my
heart
seemed
involuntarily
to
fail
me
bethlem
gabor
too
appeared
to
neglect
me
he
had
never
shown
himself
so
little
obliging
and
attentive
as
at
this
moment
and
aided
by
the
rest
of
the
scene
i
thought
i
had
never
beheld
him
so
deformed
or
so
tremendous
i
was
more
than
half
inclined
to
wish
myself
again
a
prisoner
with
the
austrians
when
we
arrived
at
the
castle
we
were
all
of
us
fatigued
and
hungry
we
had
roamed
during
the
whole
night
a
repast
was
prepared
we
sat
down
to
partake
of
it
excuse
me
said
bethlem
gabor
in
a
low
voice
as
he
passed
me
that
i
this
night
offer
you
the
fare
of
a
soldier
you
shall
be
accommodated
in
a
different
the
words
were
innocent
the
proceeding
natural
but
there
was
a
mysterious
gloom
at
least
as
i
thought
in
the
tone
in
which
he
spoke
that
electrified
me
the
hall
in
which
we
supped
was
spacious
and
lofty
the
naked
walls
and
rafters
were
imbrowned
with
age
though
it
was
daybreak
as
we
entered
the
windows
were
still
darkened
and
the
apartment
was
illuminated
only
by
the
partial
glare
of
lamps
depending
from
the
roof
as
i
sat
at
table
with
the
troop
of
my
host
i
appeared
to
myself
as
if
inclosed
in
a
cavern
of
banditti
though
excellent
partisans
skilful
in
execution
and
perfect
in
their
discipline
they
were
unpolished
in
their
manners
and
brutal
in
their
conversation
i
had
been
inured
from
infancy
to
all
the
refinement
that
the
age
in
which
i
lived
had
any
where
to
boast
and
amidst
the
various
evils
i
had
suffered
that
of
being
associated
with
the
vulgar
and
the
base
had
never
presented
itself
while
they
uttered
now
a
loathsome
jest
and
now
a
sanguinary
ejaculation
i
became
ashamed
of
my
species
and
the
pride
of
manhood
perished
within
me
they
however
paid
little
attention
either
to
my
feelings
or
my
person
and
accustomed
as
i
had
been
whether
with
friends
or
enemies
to
be
regarded
as
of
some
importance
i
found
myself
unaccountably
and
suddenly
dwindled
into
a
cipher
i
felt
it
like
a
release
from
the
state
of
a
when
bethlem
gabor
proposed
that
we
should
break
up
our
meeting
and
retire
to
rest
chapter
xl
a
succession
of
gloomy
thoughts
revolved
in
my
mind
for
some
time
after
i
was
left
to
myself
i
was
however
overcome
with
fatigue
and
after
an
interval
of
harassing
meditations
insensibly
fell
asleep
i
was
awakened
after
some
hours
repose
by
the
presence
of
bethlem
gabor
standing
by
the
side
of
my
couch
he
invited
me
to
rise
and
when
i
had
attired
myself
started
the
plan
of
our
visiting
together
the
various
apartments
of
the
castle
a
small
part
of
which
only
had
been
seen
by
me
when
i
was
last
at
this
place
among
other
things
he
told
me
there
was
a
subterranean
of
most
wonderful
extent
interspersed
with
a
variety
of
cells
and
lurking
places
of
which
no
man
had
to
his
knowledge
ever
ascertained
the
number
the
same
dreary
complexion
of
thought
followed
me
which
had
been
first
produced
in
me
upon
my
reception
into
the
troop
of
bethlem
gabor
the
preceding
night
my
sensations
were
of
the
most
depressing
and
discomfiting
nature
i
felt
as
if
i
were
the
slave
of
some
dark
mysterious
tyrant
and
dragged
along
supinely
wherever
he
motioned
me
to
go
i
tasked
myself
seriously
i
reasoned
with
myself
i
felt
that
it
was
no
idle
and
part
that
i
was
called
to
sustain
and
i
resolved
that
i
would
not
be
ruined
by
my
own
inactivity
and
cowardice
yet
when
i
examined
the
question
dispassionately
i
could
not
find
that
i
had
any
occasion
for
courage
and
i
confessed
that
it
was
not
less
censurable
to
discover
a
useless
spirit
of
mistrust
and
defiance
than
to
desert
one
s
preservation
where
resistance
was
demanded
what
reason
had
i
to
suspect
a
man
between
whom
and
myself
there
had
prevailed
so
much
mutual
confidence
none
none
i
replied
but
the
causeless
and
superstitious
misgivings
of
my
own
mind
even
if
i
had
ground
to
distrust
him
what
remedy
had
i
against
his
ill
faith
placed
as
i
was
in
the
midst
of
his
own
domains
and
surrounded
by
men
devoted
to
his
service
to
discover
apprehension
under
such
circumstances
was
to
excite
these
reasonings
particularly
occurred
to
my
mind
as
i
stood
waiting
for
the
torch
which
he
had
himself
gone
to
procure
that
he
might
attend
me
to
the
subterranean
i
had
as
yet
seen
no
one
since
we
broke
up
from
our
nightly
repast
but
my
host
we
will
breakfast
said
he
when
we
return
from
viewing
these
we
crept
along
a
succession
of
dark
and
gloomy
vaults
almost
in
silence
bethlem
gabor
though
he
led
me
on
and
discharged
the
office
of
a
guide
seemed
to
have
small
inclination
to
assume
that
of
an
interpreter
this
was
sufficiently
in
unison
with
his
ordinary
character
to
have
little
claim
to
excite
surprise
yet
the
reader
will
not
on
reflection
greatly
wonder
that
my
present
situation
was
far
from
agreeable
i
was
alone
in
passages
which
to
judge
from
any
discoverable
token
you
would
scarcely
imagine
had
for
ages
been
trod
by
a
human
creature
the
voice
was
lost
amidst
the
damps
of
these
immense
caverns
nor
was
it
possible
by
any
exertion
to
call
the
hand
of
man
to
your
aid
my
guide
was
an
individual
whom
calamity
had
prompted
to
quarrel
with
the
world
of
strong
feelings
indeed
of
capacious
thought
but
rugged
ferocious
brutal
and
inaccessible
to
prayer
i
had
chosen
him
for
my
protector
and
ally
i
had
never
intended
to
put
myself
in
his
power
there
was
a
mystery
in
his
carriage
a
something
not
to
be
explained
a
shell
that
no
human
forces
could
penetrate
that
was
mortal
to
confidence
and
might
quail
the
stoutest
i
thought
there
would
be
no
end
to
our
pilgrimage
at
length
we
came
to
a
strong
door
and
secured
with
a
frame
of
iron
bethlem
gabor
unlocked
it
we
had
no
sooner
entered
that
it
impetuously
closed
behind
us
what
is
that
said
i
startled
at
the
loudness
of
the
report
come
on
cried
my
host
it
is
only
the
wind
whistling
through
the
caverns
the
is
shot
but
i
have
the
key
in
my
hand
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
apartment
was
another
door
with
an
ascent
of
five
steps
leading
to
it
bethlem
gabor
unlocked
that
also
and
then
faced
about
with
the
torch
in
his
hand
i
was
close
behind
him
stay
where
you
are
said
he
with
a
furious
accent
and
thrust
me
violently
from
him
the
violence
was
unexpected
i
staggered
from
the
top
of
the
steps
to
the
bottom
this
door
closed
with
as
loud
a
report
as
the
other
bethlem
gabor
disappeared
i
was
left
in
darkness
for
an
instant
i
doubted
whether
the
situation
in
which
i
thus
found
myself
were
the
result
of
design
or
of
accident
the
shutting
of
the
door
might
be
ascribed
to
the
latter
the
action
however
and
the
words
of
my
host
did
not
admit
of
that
interpretation
i
stood
motionless
astonished
and
almost
incapable
of
reflection
what
an
incredible
reverse
was
thus
the
creature
of
a
moment
yesterday
i
possessed
unbounded
treasures
and
the
hearts
of
the
whole
nation
yesterday
as
i
rode
forth
on
this
fatal
excursion
i
beheld
the
food
of
a
mighty
people
mature
for
consumption
the
growth
of
my
exertions
and
it
will
not
be
thought
surprising
that
my
heart
leaped
within
me
at
the
sight
who
would
not
have
envied
the
unparalleled
eminence
at
which
i
had
arrived
my
triumphs
were
attended
with
no
melancholy
exceptions
to
damp
their
joy
they
were
the
children
of
no
intrigue
they
were
manly
frank
ingenuous
and
honourable
my
laurels
were
stained
with
no
drop
of
blood
were
tarnished
with
no
tears
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
how
much
more
noble
to
rescue
mankind
from
famine
and
death
than
to
violate
the
honest
pride
of
their
nature
with
the
exhibition
of
victories
and
trophies
yet
truly
considered
there
was
nothing
abrupt
in
the
reverse
under
which
i
was
now
suffering
the
whole
was
a
chain
every
link
of
which
was
indissolubly
connected
from
one
end
to
the
other
my
attempt
to
rescue
a
people
from
the
horrors
of
famine
necessarily
exposed
me
to
unfavourable
accidents
and
misconstruction
it
inevitably
led
to
my
application
to
the
government
for
its
aid
it
could
not
fail
to
excite
the
alarms
and
jealousies
of
government
as
to
the
tendency
of
my
proceedings
by
exhibiting
me
as
the
possessor
of
immense
wealth
with
very
limited
means
for
the
protection
of
that
wealth
it
marked
me
a
prey
to
a
rapacious
viceroy
or
his
more
despotic
master
when
i
became
sensible
of
the
precarious
situation
in
which
i
stood
towards
the
powers
of
the
state
could
i
have
fallen
upon
a
more
natural
expedient
than
the
endeavour
to
cover
myself
with
the
shield
of
friendship
and
gratitude
in
the
person
of
one
of
its
nobles
but
this
expedient
would
almost
infallibly
lead
to
the
placing
myself
sooner
or
later
in
the
power
of
the
man
whose
friendship
i
sought
i
had
done
so
and
this
was
the
termination
of
my
views
and
my
projects
i
now
well
understood
the
purpose
of
that
inattention
and
neglect
with
which
bethlem
gabor
had
treated
me
the
preceding
evening
the
uneasiness
resulting
from
which
i
had
blamed
in
myself
at
the
time
as
the
dictate
of
weakness
and
unworthy
suspicion
yesterday
i
had
been
placed
under
the
safeguard
of
a
nation
every
man
in
buda
and
its
environs
was
familiar
with
my
person
every
man
would
have
been
ready
almost
to
sacrifice
his
life
to
procure
my
safety
now
i
was
far
from
the
scene
of
my
philanthropical
exertions
no
one
in
the
troop
of
bethlem
gabor
knew
who
i
was
he
had
appeared
to
treat
me
the
preceding
evening
with
indifference
and
contempt
if
they
saw
me
no
more
no
curiosity
would
by
that
circumstance
be
excited
in
their
minds
my
clients
on
the
other
hand
in
the
vicinity
of
the
metropolis
however
great
an
interest
they
might
take
in
my
fortune
had
no
clue
that
could
lead
them
to
the
knowledge
of
it
they
must
suppose
me
a
prisoner
with
the
austrians
or
that
i
had
been
killed
in
resisting
to
become
their
prisoner
i
was
cut
off
from
all
assistance
and
discovery
and
left
as
much
in
the
power
of
my
treacherous
ally
as
if
i
had
been
alone
with
him
oppressed
with
the
utmost
disparity
of
personal
force
in
the
remotest
island
of
the
pacific
ocean
such
were
the
reflections
that
early
suggested
themselves
to
my
mind
in
the
solitude
and
darkness
in
which
i
was
thus
unexpectedly
involved
meanwhile
one
tedious
hour
succeeded
to
another
and
i
remained
unintruded
on
and
unnoticed
i
could
form
no
conjecture
as
to
the
object
of
bethlem
gabor
in
the
atrocious
perfidy
he
had
committed
could
he
have
any
resentment
against
me
and
did
he
meditate
revenge
he
had
received
from
me
nothing
but
benefits
did
he
employ
restraint
on
my
person
as
the
means
of
extortion
i
could
not
conceive
that
he
could
have
any
clue
leading
him
to
the
discovery
of
my
grand
secret
and
short
of
this
my
bounties
had
been
so
exuberant
as
i
imagined
left
him
nothing
to
wish
in
this
wilderness
of
conjecture
i
however
fixed
upon
extortion
as
a
motive
less
incredible
than
revenge
i
impatiently
waited
till
the
appearance
of
my
tyrant
should
free
me
from
some
part
of
my
present
uncertainty
he
did
not
appear
in
the
mean
time
i
was
in
a
condition
feeble
and
exhausted
the
exercise
of
yesterday
the
expectation
of
meeting
him
whom
i
had
called
my
friend
the
alternation
of
being
first
taken
prisoner
and
afterwards
rescued
had
extremely
fatigued
me
we
had
travelled
during
the
whole
night
yet
the
unaccountable
dejection
of
mind
under
which
i
laboured
on
our
arrival
at
bethlem
gabor
s
castle
had
prevented
me
from
taking
almost
any
share
in
the
coarse
repast
that
had
then
been
set
before
us
the
entrance
of
my
host
in
the
morning
had
rendered
my
slumbers
short
as
i
followed
him
to
my
dungeon
unconscious
whither
i
went
my
limbs
ached
and
my
heart
ached
still
more
i
was
ill
prepared
for
a
fast
of
hours
which
the
brutality
of
my
jailor
inflicted
upon
me
after
having
long
expected
him
in
vain
i
gave
myself
up
to
despair
what
a
termination
of
life
for
him
who
possessed
the
philosopher
s
stone
i
can
not
do
justice
to
the
sensations
that
now
took
possession
of
my
mind
it
was
not
the
deadly
calm
of
despair
for
i
still
expected
every
moment
when
bethlem
gabor
would
appear
i
believed
than
he
would
and
i
believed
that
he
would
not
leave
me
to
perish
i
listened
with
eager
attention
to
every
sound
and
my
soul
floated
on
the
howling
winds
in
vain
nothing
came
of
it
there
was
no
alteration
in
the
sound
or
only
those
vicissitudes
to
which
the
howling
of
the
wind
is
unavoidably
subject
i
then
turned
away
in
anguish
i
cursed
i
stamped
with
my
feet
i
smote
my
forehead
with
my
closed
hand
i
tore
my
hair
anon
another
sound
arrested
my
attention
it
was
a
different
howling
it
seemed
to
be
like
a
human
voice
my
fancy
created
to
me
the
tread
of
a
human
foot
i
listened
with
more
intentness
of
soul
than
ever
it
was
again
in
vain
no
no
he
will
not
come
he
will
never
come
why
should
i
agitate
myself
to
no
purpose
let
me
lie
down
and
die
i
reasoned
with
myself
why
should
i
wish
to
live
i
am
nothing
to
any
human
being
i
am
alone
in
the
boundless
universe
i
have
no
tie
to
existence
leon
has
no
wife
leon
has
no
child
he
has
neither
connection
nor
friend
in
the
world
even
in
this
wretched
vision
of
the
philosopher
s
stone
have
i
not
tried
it
enough
have
i
any
hopes
from
it
is
it
not
time
that
i
should
throw
away
that
and
existence
together
my
meditations
were
ineffectual
i
suppose
it
is
the
case
with
all
men
thus
violently
thrust
out
of
life
in
the
full
possession
of
their
faculties
i
know
it
was
the
case
with
me
the
more
peremptory
was
my
summoner
the
more
obstinately
i
clung
to
the
worthless
toy
at
length
i
laid
myself
down
on
the
floor
and
if
i
occasionally
listened
i
no
longer
ran
to
the
walls
and
the
doors
to
catch
the
uncertain
sounds
the
gnawings
i
now
felt
within
were
intolerable
they
were
at
one
period
so
severe
that
i
can
compare
them
to
nothing
but
the
sensation
of
having
swallowed
a
glowing
ember
afterwards
the
weakness
of
nature
would
no
longer
feed
this
excruciating
pain
and
it
subsided
into
a
starting
and
convulsive
throb
the
pain
was
diversified
with
intervals
of
a
and
insupportable
but
no
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
the
horrors
of
hunger
sublimed
by
despair
where
the
torture
of
the
mind
gives
new
pungency
and
uproar
to
the
corporeal
anguish
the
image
as
it
now
presents
itself
to
my
recollection
is
too
dreadful
at
last
i
sunk
into
a
state
of
insensibility
and
the
agony
i
had
suffered
seemed
drawn
to
its
final
close
the
busy
turmoil
the
feverish
dream
of
human
existence
was
at
an
end
i
shut
my
eyes
and
i
believed
i
should
open
them
no
more
chapter
xli
how
long
i
endured
this
suspension
of
the
vital
faculties
i
can
not
tell
the
next
impression
on
my
sensorium
subsequent
to
those
i
have
described
was
a
sort
of
external
twitching
and
violence
that
seemed
to
persecute
me
it
was
an
importunity
from
which
i
felt
desirous
to
escape
i
longed
to
be
undisturbed
and
at
rest
the
intruder
on
my
quiet
would
not
leave
me
and
i
at
length
roused
myself
as
if
to
put
away
my
cause
of
molestation
my
thoughts
were
all
confounded
and
obscure
i
knew
not
where
i
could
scarcely
be
said
to
know
who
i
was
a
little
more
effort
brought
with
it
a
further
capacity
of
perception
i
saw
before
me
what
was
now
the
chief
object
of
my
mortal
aversion
the
figure
of
bethlem
gabor
it
was
some
time
longer
before
i
became
aware
that
he
had
been
employed
in
taking
up
my
apparently
lifeless
corpse
placing
it
on
a
in
the
side
of
the
cave
and
chaining
it
to
the
wall
he
observed
the
motions
that
indicated
in
me
returning
life
he
remarked
the
stare
of
my
glassy
and
rayless
eyes
he
now
spoke
with
a
stern
and
unpitying
voice
there
is
food
there
is
a
light
eat
having
thus
said
he
left
me
what
a
cruel
and
remorseless
treatment
he
cared
not
for
my
life
he
disdained
to
make
the
slightest
exertion
to
restore
me
he
left
it
to
chance
whether
i
should
revive
or
perish
the
figure
of
a
dying
man
that
i
presented
did
not
make
one
fibre
of
his
bosom
bend
or
quiver
i
revived
i
ate
by
degrees
i
recovered
from
the
deadly
languor
which
had
invaded
my
senses
in
about
twelve
hours
longer
bethlem
gabor
returned
with
a
new
supply
of
sustenance
i
was
now
strong
enough
to
be
able
to
converse
with
him
i
heard
the
heavy
sound
of
opening
locks
and
removing
bolts
before
he
entered
and
i
summoned
my
faculties
to
expostulate
with
him
why
am
i
here
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
unworthy
way
in
which
you
treat
me
it
is
he
regarded
me
with
a
truculent
aspect
as
if
he
would
pierce
through
my
heart
because
i
hate
you
you
hate
me
good
god
is
it
possible
what
evil
have
i
done
to
you
what
good
have
i
not
done
you
what
supplies
have
i
refused
you
what
occasions
have
i
neglected
of
studying
your
advantage
your
interest
and
your
honour
if
thus
your
hatred
is
purchased
how
shall
that
man
demean
himself
who
is
to
purchase
your
love
oh
think
not
my
hatred
idle
or
capricious
heaven
knows
i
would
have
refrained
from
hating
you
if
i
had
been
able
i
struggled
against
it
with
all
the
energies
of
my
soul
but
you
have
committed
towards
me
the
most
mortal
offences
that
man
ever
endured
there
is
an
antipathy
between
your
nature
and
mine
that
all
the
menstruums
in
the
world
could
never
bring
to
eternal
providence
and
what
is
the
source
of
this
antipathy
and
do
you
profess
ignorance
have
you
not
gone
on
day
after
day
with
the
full
consciousness
and
will
to
torment
me
have
i
not
warned
you
and
expostulated
with
you
times
without
number
of
what
have
you
warned
me
i
hate
mankind
i
was
not
born
to
hate
them
i
have
no
native
obliquity
of
character
i
have
no
diabolical
maliciousness
of
constitution
but
they
have
forced
me
to
hate
them
and
the
debt
of
abhorrence
shall
be
amply
paid
i
loved
as
never
mortal
loved
no
human
heart
was
ever
so
devoted
and
centred
and
enveloped
in
the
kindly
affections
of
family
and
parentage
as
mine
has
been
was
not
my
wife
were
not
my
children
murdered
when
i
came
home
to
feast
my
eyes
and
tranquillise
my
soul
with
the
sight
of
them
did
i
not
find
all
waste
and
desolation
did
i
not
find
their
bodies
naked
pale
disfigured
with
wounds
plunged
in
blood
and
already
putrid
this
was
the
welcome
i
looked
for
this
was
the
object
i
so
speeded
to
see
no
never
was
a
moment
like
that
my
whole
nature
was
changed
in
an
instant
my
eyes
were
blasted
and
dried
to
horn
my
blood
froze
in
my
well
stored
veins
i
have
no
longer
delight
but
in
human
misery
my
revenge
is
not
causeless
this
was
not
the
act
of
individuals
all
men
in
the
place
of
these
murderers
would
have
done
as
they
did
they
are
in
a
league
together
human
pity
and
forbearance
never
had
a
harbour
but
in
my
breast
and
i
have
now
abjured
them
with
something
more
of
inwrought
vigour
and
energy
i
will
become
like
to
my
brethren
all
men
are
excited
by
the
same
motives
urged
by
the
same
temptations
influenced
by
the
same
inducements
why
should
i
attempt
a
futile
distinction
when
nature
had
made
none
all
men
bear
the
same
figure
i
can
not
view
the
human
figure
without
a
torture
the
most
i
always
knew
answered
i
your
general
hatred
of
mankind
but
your
manners
and
your
behaviour
persuaded
me
that
you
exempted
me
from
the
general
i
wished
to
do
so
you
made
the
attempt
impossible
you
told
me
that
you
had
suffered
the
same
misfortunes
which
i
had
that
you
by
the
injustice
and
persecutions
of
men
had
also
lost
your
wife
and
your
children
i
hailed
you
as
a
brother
in
my
heart
i
swore
to
you
eternal
friendship
i
said
we
will
carry
on
this
holy
warfare
together
we
communicated
to
each
other
our
mutual
sorrows
with
you
and
you
only
i
found
moments
of
consolation
soon
i
discovered
my
mistake
instead
of
like
me
seeking
occasions
of
glorious
mischief
and
vengeance
you
took
upon
yourself
to
be
the
benefactor
and
parent
of
mankind
what
vocation
had
you
to
the
task
with
the
spirit
of
a
slave
who
the
more
he
is
beaten
becomes
the
more
servile
and
submissive
you
remunerated
injuries
with
benefits
i
found
that
there
was
not
within
you
one
atom
of
generous
sentiment
one
honest
glow
of
fervent
indignation
wretch
poor
soulless
poltroon
to
say
the
best
of
you
to
your
insensate
heart
it
was
the
same
whether
you
were
treated
with
reverence
or
scorn
i
saw
you
hunted
hooted
at
and
pursued
by
the
people
you
fed
you
held
on
your
course
and
fed
them
still
i
was
compelled
to
witness
or
to
hear
of
your
senseless
liberalities
every
day
i
lived
could
i
submit
to
this
torment
and
not
endeavour
to
remove
it
i
hate
the
man
in
whom
kindness
produces
no
responsive
affection
and
injustice
no
swell
no
glow
of
resentment
i
hated
you
the
more
because
having
suffered
what
i
had
suffered
your
feelings
and
conduct
on
the
occasion
have
been
the
reverse
of
mine
your
character
i
thank
god
is
of
all
beings
the
most
opposite
to
that
of
bethlem
gabor
at
length
you
filled
up
the
measure
of
the
various
thwartings
with
which
you
daily
insulted
me
there
was
one
native
of
hungary
between
whom
and
me
there
subsisted
an
open
and
eternal
war
i
relate
in
no
human
ear
the
cause
of
my
animosity
to
that
man
suffice
it
that
it
was
deep
immeasurable
inexpiable
with
a
refinement
of
cruelty
and
insult
difficult
to
conceive
you
chose
that
man
for
one
of
the
objects
of
your
beneficence
would
i
consent
to
see
my
name
joined
in
pension
list
with
my
mortal
enemy
the
injury
you
inflicted
on
me
would
have
been
less
if
you
had
stabbed
me
to
the
heart
less
that
would
have
been
a
blessing
i
impose
on
myself
the
task
of
living
for
my
revenge
but
never
shall
i
deem
that
man
my
foe
who
should
rid
me
of
all
this
tumult
of
passions
and
this
insupportable
load
of
existence
together
you
have
heard
my
motives
you
may
wonder
at
you
may
censure
them
but
they
are
human
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
to
you
now
you
have
no
need
to
recur
to
expostulation
expostulation
never
moved
the
heart
of
bethlem
gabor
hereafter
you
shall
hear
more
thus
speaking
he
left
me
and
i
must
confess
with
whatever
disgrace
to
my
sagacity
he
opened
upon
me
a
new
world
i
conceived
not
till
now
the
faintest
suspicion
of
what
had
been
labouring
in
his
bosom
amidst
all
my
experience
of
the
varieties
of
human
character
this
was
a
species
that
had
never
fallen
under
my
observation
before
what
a
painful
and
mortifying
occurrence
is
it
in
human
life
when
we
have
lived
with
a
man
from
day
to
day
when
we
have
conversed
with
him
familiarly
and
seen
him
in
all
the
changes
of
circumstance
and
when
we
flatter
ourselves
we
have
penetrated
all
the
recesses
of
his
heart
suddenly
to
start
upon
something
portentous
that
brooded
there
of
which
to
that
moment
we
had
not
the
lightest
suspicion
i
am
not
the
only
individual
to
whom
this
event
has
occurred
in
a
subsequent
visit
of
bethlem
gabor
to
my
cell
for
he
only
attended
me
with
provisions
he
would
intrust
the
secret
of
my
confinement
to
no
other
mortal
i
intreated
him
to
inform
me
with
what
intention
he
retained
me
a
prisoner
and
to
fix
a
price
on
my
ransom
to
this
overture
he
appeared
to
yield
some
degree
of
attention
he
made
no
explicit
answer
but
asked
with
an
inquisitive
and
severe
tone
in
what
manner
i
imagined
i
could
procure
money
in
my
dungeon
let
us
agree
upon
the
terms
and
set
me
at
large
you
have
never
found
me
deceitful
and
you
shall
not
find
me
deceitful
do
not
hope
i
will
consent
to
that
i
ask
you
again
in
what
manner
do
you
imagine
you
can
procure
money
in
your
dungeon
i
reflected
for
a
moment
liberty
is
ineffably
sweet
and
whatever
followed
upon
the
present
overture
i
was
determined
not
to
neglect
the
faintest
prospect
that
led
to
a
termination
of
my
confinement
there
is
answered
i
in
my
mansion
at
buda
a
chest
which
if
it
can
be
brought
to
me
hither
will
enable
me
to
supply
your
demands
i
have
the
key
in
my
custody
and
no
key
but
my
own
will
unlock
the
give
me
the
key
replied
bethlem
gabor
no
rejoined
i
it
is
in
my
custody
it
is
not
upon
my
person
i
have
taken
care
of
that
no
human
hand
shall
touch
it
but
my
and
how
can
i
cause
this
chest
to
be
brought
to
you
without
risking
a
discovery
of
your
situation
or
that
i
had
a
concern
in
your
disappearance
of
that
said
i
judge
for
yourself
i
have
made
a
proposition
to
you
and
i
have
done
enough
i
will
have
no
share
in
the
detail
of
its
well
said
bethlem
gabor
after
having
ruminated
a
moment
the
chest
you
shall
have
i
undertake
that
describe
i
described
the
chest
and
its
situation
in
my
house
with
a
minuteness
that
made
mistake
impossible
after
a
considerable
time
it
was
brought
to
me
it
was
too
bulky
and
ponderous
to
be
introduced
into
my
cell
by
a
single
arm
but
bethlem
gabor
having
first
caused
me
unconsciously
to
swallow
a
powerful
opiate
found
no
difficulty
either
to
conceal
my
person
in
the
dark
shadows
of
this
ragged
subterranean
or
to
cause
some
of
his
followers
to
place
the
chest
within
my
reach
believing
that
they
placed
it
in
a
vacant
apartment
i
awoke
and
found
it
at
hand
i
was
secure
that
the
lock
was
such
a
one
as
could
not
be
forced
but
i
examined
the
different
surfaces
to
see
whether
violence
of
any
other
sort
had
been
exercised
on
it
there
were
marks
of
damage
but
not
sufficiently
unequivocal
to
enable
me
to
form
a
certain
judgment
on
this
point
the
chest
contained
not
gold
but
the
implements
for
making
and
fashioning
gold
allowing
for
the
distance
from
which
it
was
brought
they
appeared
to
be
pretty
exactly
in
the
state
in
which
i
left
them
i
had
never
placed
much
confidence
in
this
expedient
for
softening
the
heart
of
bethlem
gabor
but
i
perceived
that
it
would
serve
at
worst
to
divert
my
thoughts
and
by
exciting
in
me
some
share
of
expectation
might
call
off
my
attention
from
the
miseries
of
my
present
condition
embracing
the
occasions
when
i
was
most
secure
against
the
intrusion
of
my
jailor
i
provided
myself
with
the
sum
that
had
been
previously
agreed
on
between
us
my
task
being
finished
i
carefully
displayed
the
produce
of
my
labour
against
the
next
time
bethlem
gabor
should
visit
my
cell
he
viewed
it
with
an
air
of
sullen
and
gloomy
triumph
he
removed
it
from
the
cave
which
was
my
habitation
to
an
apartment
of
this
subterraneous
abode
little
distant
from
my
own
when
he
had
concluded
this
employment
it
seemed
to
be
a
just
inference
that
he
was
to
give
me
my
liberty
he
did
no
such
thing
without
uttering
a
word
he
closed
the
door
of
my
cavern
locked
it
and
departed
when
bethlem
gabor
next
entered
my
cell
i
reproached
him
with
this
as
with
the
breach
of
a
solemn
engagement
his
first
answer
was
an
infernal
laugh
expressive
of
derision
and
contempt
by
and
by
however
he
condescended
to
explain
himself
more
fully
i
made
no
engagement
cried
he
you
talked
of
a
ransom
and
i
suffered
you
to
talk
i
made
you
no
answer
i
gave
you
no
encouragement
boy
i
deceived
you
not
no
though
my
heart
pants
for
vengeance
and
for
misery
i
will
never
be
guilty
of
treachery
i
will
break
no
engagements
i
am
a
knight
and
a
soldier
you
have
given
me
ten
thousand
ducats
what
are
ten
thousand
ducats
to
me
do
you
think
i
am
uninformed
of
your
secret
i
opened
your
chest
i
found
no
gold
its
contents
were
crucibles
minerals
chemical
preparations
and
the
tools
of
an
artist
you
are
possessed
of
the
grand
arcanum
the
philosophers
stone
if
i
had
a
doubt
of
it
before
the
transaction
of
yesterday
converted
conjecture
into
certainty
and
did
you
suppose
idiot
driveller
that
you
are
that
i
would
take
ten
thousand
ducats
in
commutation
for
wealth
inexhaustible
no
you
are
my
prisoner
and
may
choose
in
this
infallible
dilemma
whether
you
will
remain
my
slave
to
supply
me
daily
resources
as
i
shall
daily
think
proper
to
demand
or
at
once
make
over
to
me
your
whole
mystery
and
place
me
in
this
respect
on
a
level
with
it
was
now
my
part
to
be
peremptory
and
firm
i
refuse
said
i
every
part
of
your
dilemma
and
all
that
you
can
propose
to
me
do
you
talk
of
my
remaining
your
slave
to
supply
you
with
daily
resources
do
you
imagine
that
shut
up
in
this
dungeon
i
will
nevertheless
labour
for
your
gratification
do
you
believe
that
that
gift
which
i
received
as
the
instrument
of
my
own
happiness
and
the
benefit
of
mankind
shall
be
made
the
pledge
of
my
perpetual
imprisonment
with
regard
to
imparting
to
you
the
secret
you
suppose
me
to
possess
i
answer
without
hesitation
that
dearly
as
i
prize
liberty
and
numerous
as
are
the
motives
you
may
think
i
have
to
prize
it
i
will
not
purchase
my
liberty
at
that
rate
i
would
rather
spend
the
days
of
eternity
in
this
cavern
than
comply
with
your
proposal
the
gift
of
the
philosopher
s
stone
the
moment
a
man
possesses
it
purifies
his
mind
from
sordid
and
ignoble
inducements
the
endowment
which
raises
him
so
much
above
his
species
makes
him
glory
in
his
superiority
and
cherish
his
innocence
he
can
not
if
he
would
mingle
in
the
low
passions
and
pursuits
of
the
generality
of
mankind
for
myself
i
value
too
much
the
verdict
of
my
own
heart
ever
to
allow
myself
to
be
influenced
in
the
main
concerns
of
my
existence
by
menaces
and
compulsion
beside
this
gift
i
received
for
holy
and
beneficent
purposes
to
such
it
is
consecrated
and
if
i
ever
impart
it
i
must
select
its
depository
with
all
the
assiduity
and
penetration
it
is
practicable
for
me
to
exert
you
i
will
henceforth
benefit
no
more
you
hate
me
my
disapprobation
of
you
is
fixed
and
irrevocable
i
weep
to
think
how
much
i
have
been
deceived
in
you
i
weep
to
think
how
many
high
and
heroic
qualities
in
your
breast
are
now
converted
into
malignity
and
you
the
possessor
of
the
philosopher
s
stone
you
tell
me
the
sole
pursuit
of
the
rest
of
your
life
is
revenge
and
human
misery
what
an
image
do
you
raise
in
my
mind
if
with
such
dispositions
you
possessed
the
means
which
the
acquisition
of
riches
inexhaustible
would
confer
on
you
and
do
you
believe
that
any
consideration
on
earth
could
induce
me
to
realise
such
an
image
as
you
please
replied
bethlem
gabor
indignantly
i
have
nothing
to
propose
to
you
think
you
that
either
as
my
enemy
or
my
slave
and
i
hold
you
for
both
i
would
descend
to
negotiate
with
you
i
simply
told
you
your
situation
yours
be
the
consequences
of
your
wilfulness
and
folly
one
mistake
however
that
i
see
you
make
respecting
my
purposes
i
will
remove
you
seem
to
suppose
that
if
you
were
to
communicate
to
me
your
secret
i
would
then
set
you
at
liberty
no
by
heavens
this
cavern
is
your
abode
for
ever
you
shall
never
go
forth
from
it
alive
and
when
you
are
dead
here
your
flesh
shall
moulder
and
your
skeleton
shall
rest
as
long
as
the
world
remains
look
round
your
walls
enter
fully
into
possession
of
your
final
home
i
know
that
to
keep
you
here
and
alive
my
prisoner
i
must
in
a
certain
sense
imprison
myself
but
at
that
i
do
not
murmur
i
shall
have
the
gratification
of
beholding
my
foe
and
seeing
him
daily
wither
in
disappointment
you
wish
to
be
a
father
to
the
human
race
and
i
shall
deem
the
scope
of
my
misanthropy
almost
satisfied
while
in
your
restraint
i
image
myself
as
making
the
human
race
an
orphan
never
shall
bethlem
gabor
set
at
large
a
man
of
your
unnatural
and
disposition
and
your
powers
for
the
indulgence
of
that
disposition
sieur
de
chatillon
i
do
not
want
your
secret
it
suffices
that
i
know
you
possess
it
have
i
not
yourself
in
my
keeping
it
will
be
more
joy
to
me
rudely
to
issue
my
commands
and
to
see
you
complying
with
them
in
spite
of
the
most
heartfelt
reluctance
than
to
possess
the
richest
gift
on
earth
in
the
fullest
independence
think
you
bethlem
gabor
incompetent
to
tame
the
tenant
of
this
wretched
cavern
boy
you
my
prisoner
you
my
creature
i
will
humble
you
at
my
feet
and
teach
you
to
implore
my
bounty
for
the
most
miserable
pittance
look
to
it
you
know
your
destiny
do
not
provoke
my
fury
without
a
foresight
of
the
consequences
i
will
enter
into
little
further
detail
of
this
my
wretched
imprisonment
in
the
wilds
of
hungary
it
was
not
destitute
of
its
varieties
and
i
could
if
i
pleased
fill
a
volume
with
the
artifices
and
the
violence
of
my
gloomy
superintendent
i
could
fill
volumes
with
the
detail
of
the
multiplied
expedients
the
furious
menaces
the
gigantic
starts
and
rhapsodies
of
passion
by
which
he
alternately
urged
me
to
compliance
and
concession
but
i
will
not
i
will
bring
to
an
end
the
history
of
bethlem
gabor
and
then
having
detailed
the
surprising
events
that
immediately
followed
it
will
close
the
page
of
leon
s
history
for
ever
i
stood
like
a
rock
shut
out
from
all
other
gratifications
i
at
least
resolved
to
accumulate
in
my
own
person
all
the
energies
of
resistance
if
i
were
to
unfold
the
story
i
could
command
the
reader
s
astonishment
his
admiration
but
the
object
of
these
papers
is
to
record
not
my
merits
but
my
fate
how
different
was
my
imprisonment
in
the
cavern
of
the
palatine
from
that
which
i
had
experienced
in
the
dungeons
of
the
inquisition
there
an
inexorable
apathy
prevailed
my
tyrants
were
indifferent
whether
i
died
or
lived
filled
with
the
sense
of
their
religious
elevation
they
held
on
the
even
gravity
of
their
course
and
counted
my
groans
and
my
tears
neither
for
remorse
nor
pleasure
the
variety
i
experienced
in
their
dungeons
was
the
growth
of
my
own
thoughts
from
without
i
encountered
no
interruption
it
was
not
to
be
ascribed
to
those
who
held
me
in
durance
if
my
faculties
were
not
lethargied
into
death
bethlem
gabor
possessed
no
share
of
their
apathy
his
malice
was
ever
alive
his
hatred
ever
ingenious
and
new
in
its
devices
he
had
a
purpose
to
answer
to
extort
from
me
the
supply
of
his
necessities
and
projects
it
was
not
so
much
perhaps
that
he
stood
in
need
of
this
as
that
he
placed
a
pride
in
it
and
had
fiercely
resolved
to
show
me
that
i
was
unreservedly
his
slave
his
animosity
against
me
was
so
fixed
and
insatiable
that
nothing
that
was
pain
to
me
was
indifferent
to
him
if
at
any
time
he
saw
me
subsiding
into
insensibility
he
failed
not
to
exert
himself
to
sting
me
into
life
again
the
consequence
of
this
was
somewhat
different
from
what
bethlem
gabor
expected
desponding
as
i
was
weary
of
life
and
almost
finally
alienated
from
the
gift
of
the
philosopher
s
stone
if
he
had
left
me
to
myself
i
should
very
probably
have
sought
in
insensibility
relief
from
the
torment
of
my
own
thoughts
but
he
taught
me
a
better
lesson
refusing
me
the
indulgence
of
torpor
he
obliged
me
to
string
myself
to
resistance
he
gave
me
a
passion
he
gave
me
an
object
he
gave
me
comparative
happiness
i
was
roused
to
opposition
i
was
resolved
that
placed
as
i
seemed
to
be
at
his
mercy
i
would
yield
him
no
atom
of
his
desires
thus
employed
i
found
in
my
employment
pride
perpetual
occasion
presented
itself
for
fortitude
and
i
gradually
ascended
to
the
sweets
of
consistency
perseverance
and
i
had
for
years
been
inured
to
satisfy
myself
with
a
sparing
stock
of
pleasures
and
i
was
less
at
a
loss
to
expand
and
ramify
those
which
i
now
possessed
than
almost
any
other
man
would
have
been
in
my
situation
if
my
attendant
train
of
sensations
was
scanty
bethlem
gabor
took
care
to
afford
them
a
perpetual
supply
of
food
and
employment
and
i
was
comparatively
little
exposed
to
the
pain
of
vacuity
when
he
saw
that
i
was
inflexible
and
that
he
could
no
longer
gain
from
me
the
smallest
compliance
with
his
will
he
raged
against
me
with
terrifying
fury
was
it
a
crime
in
me
that
this
fury
in
my
tyrant
produced
the
operation
of
a
sedative
and
a
cordial
there
was
no
malignity
in
the
joy
it
gave
me
i
had
much
aversion
for
bethlem
gabor
but
no
hatred
i
took
no
pleasure
in
his
agonies
because
they
were
agonies
my
sympathies
towards
him
now
i
confess
were
small
but
the
joy
i
felt
was
because
his
fury
told
me
was
the
unwilling
evidence
of
my
own
value
i
left
him
to
assail
the
mound
i
opposed
to
his
desires
as
he
pleased
it
remained
strong
and
unaffected
as
the
from
the
inefficacy
of
his
efforts
i
sometimes
took
occasion
to
remonstrate
with
my
jailor
and
demand
the
restoration
of
my
liberty
but
bethlem
gabor
was
not
a
man
whom
arguments
and
expostulations
like
these
could
move
in
spite
of
himself
however
i
commanded
his
wonder
if
not
his
esteem
he
regarded
the
contrast
as
almost
incredible
between
the
under
which
he
saw
me
and
the
inflexibility
and
resources
of
my
mind
the
contentment
that
i
have
here
described
in
myself
was
however
a
creature
of
the
imagination
the
forced
progeny
of
uncommon
effort
it
was
no
natural
state
of
the
soul
my
mind
would
sometimes
wander
beyond
the
limits
of
my
cavern
and
remember
that
there
were
other
persons
beside
bethlem
gabor
and
myself
in
the
world
i
recollected
the
situation
in
which
i
had
left
my
great
project
for
the
reviviscence
of
hungary
and
rejoiced
to
remember
that
it
was
already
in
such
forwardness
as
i
hoped
no
longer
to
stand
in
absolute
need
of
my
assistance
yet
what
i
had
done
was
but
a
small
portion
a
dismembered
branch
of
what
i
had
meditated
to
do
and
what
every
person
of
a
generous
and
enterprising
mind
who
had
been
in
possession
of
the
philosopher
s
stone
would
have
designed
why
was
i
thus
stopped
in
the
commencement
of
a
career
so
auspiciously
begun
and
to
which
an
ardent
fancy
would
prescribe
no
limits
why
was
every
power
of
the
social
constitution
every
caprice
of
the
multitude
every
insidious
project
of
the
noble
thus
instantly
in
arms
against
so
liberal
and
grand
an
undertaking
nor
could
i
help
repining
at
the
perverseness
of
my
fate
which
had
decreed
that
i
should
savour
all
the
bitterness
incidentally
resulting
from
my
plan
and
not
be
permitted
so
much
as
to
taste
the
applause
and
reward
that
ought
to
grow
out
of
its
completion
thousands
of
men
were
at
this
instant
indebted
to
my
generosity
and
exertions
for
every
blessing
they
enjoyed
and
i
was
cast
forth
as
the
refuse
of
the
earth
pining
under
the
alternate
succession
of
solitude
negligence
and
malice
my
very
existence
and
the
manner
of
it
unknown
except
to
one
individual
who
had
from
the
strangest
and
most
unexpected
motives
sworn
eternal
hostility
to
me
bethlem
gabor
had
resolved
that
so
long
as
he
lived
i
should
remain
a
prisoner
when
he
died
if
he
continued
my
only
jailor
the
single
individual
acquainted
with
the
place
of
my
confinement
the
probable
issue
was
that
i
should
perish
with
hunger
twelve
years
before
i
should
have
contemplated
this
attitude
and
condition
of
existence
with
indescribable
horror
but
within
that
time
i
had
been
better
taught
i
had
received
an
education
i
thank
them
in
the
dungeons
of
the
spanish
inquisition
and
if
that
be
properly
considered
it
will
not
be
wondered
at
that
i
was
superior
to
ordinary
terrors
early
in
my
present
situation
the
presentiment
had
suggested
itself
to
me
that
by
some
striking
event
i
should
be
rescued
from
my
present
confinement
and
improbable
as
the
suggestion
was
it
made
an
indelible
impression
on
my
mind
i
had
originated
in
or
it
had
produced
a
dream
the
scenes
of
which
had
appeared
particularly
luminous
and
vivid
i
imagined
i
saw
a
knight
cased
complete
in
proof
enter
my
prison
a
smile
of
angelic
kindness
beamed
on
his
countenance
he
embraced
me
with
ardour
he
made
a
sign
to
me
to
follow
him
i
felt
that
i
had
seen
him
somewhere
that
he
had
been
my
intimate
friend
yet
all
the
efforts
i
made
in
sleep
or
afterwards
when
i
was
awake
were
unavailing
to
remove
the
mystery
that
hung
upon
his
features
i
rose
to
obey
him
the
ground
trembled
under
my
feet
like
an
earthquake
presently
with
the
incoherency
usually
attendant
on
a
dream
the
figure
changed
to
that
of
a
female
of
unblemished
grace
and
beauty
it
unfolded
a
pair
of
radiant
wings
we
ascended
together
in
the
air
i
looked
down
and
saw
the
castle
of
bethlem
gabor
a
prey
to
devouring
here
ended
my
dream
i
soon
felt
that
i
could
reason
myself
out
of
all
confidence
in
the
presages
of
this
wild
and
incongruous
vision
but
i
refused
to
do
it
my
consolations
were
not
so
plenteous
in
this
frightful
solitude
as
that
i
should
willingly
part
with
one
so
delicious
reason
thus
applied
i
contemplated
as
an
abhorred
intruder
it
was
for
a
long
time
part
of
my
occupation
in
every
day
to
ruminate
on
this
vision
not
with
the
sternness
of
a
syllogist
but
with
the
colouring
of
a
painter
and
the
rapture
of
a
bard
from
thus
obstinately
dwelling
on
it
in
the
day
it
happened
that
it
became
again
and
again
and
again
my
vision
of
the
night
slumbers
like
these
were
truly
refreshing
and
armed
and
nerved
me
for
the
contentions
of
my
tyrant
sacred
and
adorable
power
of
fancy
that
can
thus
purify
and
irradiate
the
damps
of
a
dungeon
and
extract
from
midnight
glooms
and
impervious
darkness
perceptions
more
lovely
and
inspiriting
than
noontide
splendour
chapter
xlii
i
had
now
continued
here
for
several
months
and
in
all
that
time
had
received
no
external
impressions
but
such
as
related
to
the
cell
i
inhabited
and
the
misanthropical
savage
by
whom
it
was
visited
one
evening
that
bethlem
gabor
entered
my
dungeon
i
observed
in
him
an
air
of
unusual
disturbance
where
apathy
reigns
the
intercourse
between
those
over
whom
it
presides
will
be
marked
with
a
uniformity
but
wherever
the
furious
passions
take
their
turn
they
will
occasionally
subside
into
a
semblance
of
familiarity
and
benevolence
there
was
something
in
the
countenance
of
my
tyrant
that
made
me
for
a
moment
forget
the
complicated
injuries
i
had
received
from
him
what
is
it
that
has
disturbed
you
cried
i
there
was
no
answer
there
was
a
knitting
in
his
brow
and
a
contraction
in
his
features
that
showed
me
his
silence
was
an
effort
he
departed
however
and
had
already
passed
the
threshold
of
my
dungeon
the
door
was
in
his
hand
he
returned
chatillon
said
he
perhaps
you
will
never
see
me
more
my
castle
is
besieged
i
have
passed
through
dangers
of
a
thousand
names
and
i
ought
not
to
be
made
serious
by
that
which
now
assails
me
but
a
gloomy
presentiment
hangs
upon
my
mind
the
busy
phantom
of
life
has
lasted
too
long
and
i
am
sick
at
heart
in
the
worst
event
i
will
not
be
made
a
prisoner
i
will
die
fighting
i
feel
as
if
this
were
the
last
day
of
my
existence
and
upon
the
brink
of
the
grave
animosity
and
ferociousness
die
away
in
my
soul
in
this
solemn
moment
my
original
character
returns
here
striking
his
heart
to
take
possession
of
its
native
home
a
character
stern
and
serious
if
you
will
but
not
sanguinary
not
cruel
not
treacherous
or
unjust
between
you
and
me
there
is
a
deadly
antipathy
but
you
did
not
make
yourself
you
intended
me
friendship
and
advantage
the
sufferings
you
have
experienced
from
me
in
return
have
been
sufficiently
severe
if
i
die
defending
my
walls
and
you
remain
thus
you
will
perish
with
hunger
i
had
intended
it
should
be
so
but
i
am
now
willing
to
remit
this
part
of
your
fate
i
will
enter
into
a
compromise
with
you
i
will
trust
to
your
fidelity
and
your
honour
i
will
take
off
your
chains
i
will
bring
you
a
timepiece
and
torches
i
will
leave
with
you
the
key
of
the
spring
lock
of
your
cavern
provided
you
will
engage
your
word
to
me
that
you
will
not
attempt
to
make
use
of
your
advantages
till
the
expiration
of
to
these
terms
i
assented
without
hesitation
the
chains
fell
from
my
wrists
and
my
ancles
i
stood
up
once
more
unshackled
and
in
respect
of
my
limbs
a
free
man
when
bethlem
gabor
was
on
the
point
to
depart
my
soul
melted
within
me
i
took
hold
of
his
hand
my
fingers
trembled
i
grasped
and
pressed
the
fingers
of
my
tyrant
i
can
not
describe
what
then
passed
in
my
bosom
no
man
can
understand
my
sensations
who
had
not
been
in
my
situation
who
had
not
passed
through
a
treatment
arbitrary
ferocious
and
inhuman
and
had
not
then
seen
the
being
who
had
wounded
him
so
unpardonably
suddenly
changing
his
character
commiserating
his
fate
and
rescuing
him
from
destruction
from
this
time
i
saw
bethlem
gabor
no
more
he
died
as
he
had
sworn
to
do
in
the
last
dike
of
his
fortress
his
and
mighty
soul
could
not
submit
to
the
condition
of
a
prisoner
he
was
nothing
if
he
were
not
free
as
the
air
and
wild
as
the
winds
i
may
be
mistaken
but
this
appears
to
me
to
have
been
a
great
and
admirable
man
he
had
within
him
all
the
ingredients
of
sublimity
and
surely
the
ingredients
of
sublimity
are
the
materials
of
heroic
virtue
i
have
much
cause
of
complaint
against
him
he
conceived
towards
me
an
animosity
the
most
barbarous
and
unprovoked
but
in
writing
this
narrative
i
have
placed
my
pride
in
controlling
the
suggestions
of
resentment
and
i
have
endeavoured
to
do
him
justice
i
had
engaged
to
wait
hours
i
waited
only
six
i
know
not
how
the
reader
will
decide
upon
the
morality
of
my
conduct
but
i
own
i
had
not
the
force
i
believe
i
may
call
it
the
insensibility
to
remain
in
my
dungeon
any
longer
there
was
no
doubt
that
if
bethlem
gabor
returned
a
conqueror
the
term
of
my
imprisonment
would
be
renewed
and
all
his
former
menaces
continued
in
force
what
should
i
deserve
to
have
thought
of
me
if
i
could
sit
down
idly
and
tamely
wait
the
return
of
my
jailor
no
liberty
is
one
of
the
rights
that
i
put
on
when
i
put
on
the
form
of
a
man
and
no
event
is
of
power
to
dissolve
or
abdicate
that
right
of
what
validity
was
the
promise
that
bethlem
gabor
extorted
from
me
by
compulsion
and
as
the
condition
of
that
which
he
had
no
title
to
withhold
what
gratitude
did
i
owe
to
this
man
who
treated
me
with
every
contumely
and
shrunk
from
nothing
but
the
thought
of
causing
me
to
perish
with
hunger
whatever
became
of
my
attempt
to
escape
i
could
at
least
in
this
vast
subterranean
hide
myself
from
the
face
of
him
who
had
injured
me
i
had
a
provision
of
phosphorus
in
my
chest
and
could
therefore
extinguish
my
torch
upon
the
slightest
alarm
and
relume
it
at
pleasure
what
was
the
value
of
life
situated
as
i
was
situated
it
was
better
to
perish
in
the
attempt
to
escape
than
linger
on
for
ever
in
perpetual
imprisonment
as
a
further
resource
i
left
a
billet
in
my
dungeon
for
for
this
also
i
had
implements
intreating
bethlem
gabor
by
every
motive
of
compassion
and
humanity
to
provide
for
me
the
means
of
sustenance
as
usual
having
taken
these
precautions
i
lighted
a
fresh
torch
and
unlocking
the
door
and
thrusting
the
key
into
my
girdle
set
out
upon
my
expedition
though
bethlem
gabor
had
stipulated
for
hours
the
siege
might
even
now
be
over
and
i
trembled
every
instant
lest
my
jailor
should
return
i
wandered
for
a
considerable
time
among
the
alleys
and
windings
of
this
immeasurable
cavern
i
had
the
precaution
to
mark
the
sides
of
the
vault
with
characters
and
tokens
as
i
passed
that
if
necessary
i
might
be
able
to
find
the
way
back
to
my
dungeon
this
might
prove
an
indispensable
resource
to
prevent
me
from
perishing
with
hunger
once
or
twice
i
changed
my
route
inferring
from
a
comparison
of
circumstances
the
best
i
could
make
that
i
was
not
in
the
direction
of
the
castle
from
which
bethlem
gabor
had
led
me
to
my
imprisonment
in
all
this
wandering
i
had
seen
nothing
i
had
heard
nothing
which
could
demonstrate
to
me
that
i
was
approaching
the
habitation
of
man
i
had
groped
my
way
for
near
two
hours
when
on
a
sudden
i
heard
a
loud
and
tremendous
shout
that
almost
stunned
me
and
that
from
its
uncommon
shock
could
be
at
no
great
distance
from
the
place
where
i
stood
this
was
succeeded
by
a
terrifying
glare
of
light
i
extinguished
my
torch
both
that
i
might
be
better
qualified
to
observe
and
that
i
might
be
less
in
danger
of
discovery
by
any
one
who
should
approach
me
unawares
the
shouts
were
several
times
repeated
the
light
i
found
to
proceed
from
that
end
of
the
vault
towards
which
i
had
been
advancing
and
by
the
best
conjectures
i
could
form
i
concluded
the
outlet
into
the
castle
to
be
at
no
great
distance
i
heard
the
crackling
of
the
flames
and
the
fall
of
rafters
and
beams
presently
i
discerned
a
volume
of
smoke
approaching
me
and
found
that
if
i
remained
long
in
my
present
station
i
should
incur
the
risk
of
being
suffocated
i
formed
my
resolution
i
concluded
that
bethlem
gabor
s
castle
was
taken
and
set
on
fire
by
the
austrians
i
believed
that
my
persecutor
was
already
no
more
to
this
faith
i
was
undoubtedly
prompted
by
the
presentiment
which
he
had
communicated
to
me
i
saw
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
emerge
into
light
till
the
flames
should
abate
i
once
more
therefore
lighted
my
torch
and
returned
by
the
straightest
road
i
could
find
to
my
dungeon
arrived
there
i
proposed
to
pass
the
interval
quietly
in
the
cavern
where
i
had
so
long
felt
the
weight
of
the
hungarian
s
chains
suddenly
however
the
suggestion
occurred
to
me
may
not
my
conjectures
be
false
may
not
bethlem
gabor
yet
repel
the
enemy
and
return
to
me
from
amidst
the
ruins
of
his
falling
castle
the
thought
was
sickness
and
extinction
to
my
heart
hope
beautiful
as
are
thy
visions
in
how
much
anguish
and
agony
do
they
clothe
the
terrors
of
disappointment
never
had
bethlem
gabor
been
half
so
dreadful
to
me
as
now
i
shrunk
away
i
took
with
me
the
fragments
of
provision
that
yet
remained
i
hid
myself
i
deemed
no
cell
remote
enough
to
conceal
me
from
the
inhuman
persecution
of
my
tyrant
i
continued
in
the
subterranean
all
that
day
and
all
the
succeeding
night
once
in
this
period
i
attempted
to
reconnoitre
the
avenue
of
my
escape
but
i
found
the
situation
still
so
heated
and
suffocating
that
i
did
not
venture
to
proceed
at
length
i
came
forth
from
this
den
of
horrors
and
again
beheld
the
light
of
the
sun
the
path
had
already
been
sufficiently
explored
by
me
and
i
no
longer
found
any
material
obstacles
i
now
saw
that
my
conjectures
were
true
the
castle
of
my
ferocious
adversary
was
a
pile
of
ruins
the
walls
indeed
for
the
most
part
remained
but
choked
with
fragments
of
the
falling
edifice
blackened
with
the
flames
and
penetrated
in
every
direction
by
the
light
of
day
with
difficulty
i
climbed
over
the
ruins
which
opposed
my
egress
from
the
subterranean
and
rendered
my
passage
to
the
outside
of
the
castle
an
affair
of
peril
and
caution
here
the
first
object
that
struck
me
was
some
tents
probably
of
the
soldiers
who
had
been
employed
in
this
work
of
destruction
i
was
hailed
by
a
sentinel
and
i
demanded
that
he
would
conduct
me
to
his
commander
he
led
me
to
the
centre
of
the
little
encampment
and
i
stood
in
the
presence
of
his
chief
i
lifted
my
eye
to
behold
him
and
was
petrified
with
such
astonishment
as
till
that
hour
i
had
never
felt
it
was
charles
my
son
my
only
son
the
darling
of
his
mother
the
idol
of
my
soul
chapter
xliii
it
may
seem
extraordinary
that
i
should
instantly
have
known
him
he
was
sitting
at
a
table
covered
with
papers
and
with
one
or
two
waiting
to
receive
his
orders
he
was
clothed
in
complete
armour
and
his
casque
was
resting
on
the
ground
by
his
side
when
i
entered
his
eye
was
fixed
on
a
despatch
that
day
received
from
the
great
palatine
of
hungary
but
in
little
more
than
a
minute
he
raised
his
head
and
his
countenance
was
completely
presented
to
my
view
it
was
fifteen
years
since
i
had
beheld
it
he
was
then
scarcely
above
half
his
present
age
a
mere
stripling
in
whom
the
first
blush
of
manhood
had
awakened
the
sentiment
of
independence
and
an
honour
impatient
of
a
shade
he
was
now
a
leader
of
warlike
bands
his
complexion
olived
over
with
service
and
his
eye
rendered
steady
with
observation
and
thought
but
i
knew
him
i
knew
him
in
a
moment
my
soul
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
told
me
who
he
was
not
all
the
arts
in
the
world
could
have
hid
him
from
me
not
all
the
tales
that
delusion
ever
framed
could
have
baffled
me
i
could
have
challenged
him
against
the
earth
i
have
already
had
occasion
to
explain
the
complexity
of
my
feelings
when
after
a
long
absence
i
visited
the
heiresses
of
the
house
of
leon
the
sweets
of
recognition
that
transporting
effervescence
of
the
mind
where
the
heart
bounds
to
meet
a
kindred
heart
where
emotions
and
tears
mingle
in
speechless
encounter
where
all
is
gazing
love
and
strict
embrace
these
pleasures
were
denied
me
i
stood
stiff
and
motionless
in
the
presence
of
my
child
my
heart
might
burst
but
it
must
not
and
it
could
not
communicate
its
feelings
after
an
instant
s
pause
of
overwhelming
sensation
i
sunk
back
on
myself
and
considered
my
own
figure
it
happened
that
exactly
opposite
to
me
in
the
tent
of
my
son
hung
his
armour
and
over
the
rest
his
polished
shield
in
which
i
saw
my
own
person
clearly
reflected
the
youth
of
my
figure
indeed
was
still
visible
but
the
hardships
of
my
dungeon
had
imprinted
themselves
in
glaring
characters
on
my
face
my
beard
was
neglected
my
hair
was
matted
and
shaggy
my
complexion
was
of
a
strong
and
deadly
yellow
my
appearance
to
a
considerable
degree
told
my
story
without
the
need
of
words
charles
enquired
of
those
who
brought
me
where
they
had
found
this
wretched
and
unhappy
figure
and
was
told
that
i
had
been
seen
a
few
minutes
before
coming
out
from
the
ruins
of
bethlem
gabor
s
castle
he
humanely
and
naturally
concluded
that
i
was
a
victim
on
whom
the
tyrant
had
exercised
his
ferocity
and
that
i
had
been
shut
up
in
some
dungeon
of
the
fortress
it
was
impossible
that
any
person
above
ground
in
the
castle
should
have
come
out
alive
from
the
operation
of
the
flames
he
commanded
that
i
should
be
led
to
a
neighbouring
tent
and
taken
care
of
after
having
been
refreshed
with
food
and
rest
and
attired
with
other
apparel
he
directed
that
i
should
be
brought
to
him
again
that
he
might
hear
my
story
under
these
circumstances
there
was
nothing
for
which
i
was
more
anxious
than
that
i
might
recruit
myself
and
shake
off
as
quickly
as
possible
the
effects
of
my
confinement
cordials
were
brought
me
and
i
tasted
of
them
i
bathed
in
a
neighbouring
stream
one
of
my
son
s
attendants
removed
my
beard
and
arranged
my
hair
i
now
desired
to
be
left
alone
that
i
might
take
some
needful
repose
i
could
not
sleep
but
i
reclined
my
limbs
upon
a
couch
and
began
to
collect
my
thoughts
i
saw
myself
in
one
hour
the
sport
of
the
most
complete
reverse
of
fortune
that
could
happen
to
a
mortal
i
had
been
the
prisoner
of
a
cavern
so
wild
and
pathless
as
almost
to
defy
the
utmost
extent
of
human
sagacity
to
explore
its
recesses
from
this
cavern
but
for
the
sudden
and
extraordinary
event
which
had
just
occurred
i
could
never
have
come
forth
alive
all
sober
calculation
would
have
taught
me
to
expect
that
i
should
have
remained
there
chained
up
like
a
savage
tiger
in
his
cage
as
long
as
bethlem
gabor
existed
and
that
when
he
died
i
should
perish
unheard
unknown
no
creature
that
lived
suspecting
my
situation
no
lapse
of
ages
ever
bringing
to
light
my
dismal
catastrophe
the
remorse
and
relenting
of
bethlem
gabor
towards
me
seemed
so
little
to
accord
with
any
thing
that
i
had
personally
witnessed
of
his
habits
and
his
mind
that
even
now
i
feel
myself
totally
unable
to
account
for
it
as
it
was
however
i
was
once
again
free
from
the
state
of
an
outlaw
imprisoned
for
life
i
suddenly
saw
myself
at
large
inspirited
by
the
light
of
the
sun
and
refreshed
by
his
genial
rays
in
the
full
possession
of
youth
and
all
its
faculties
enabled
to
return
amidst
my
clients
of
buda
or
to
seek
some
new
adventure
in
any
corner
of
the
earth
to
which
my
inclination
led
me
there
is
no
man
however
overwhelmed
with
calamities
however
persecuted
with
endless
disappointment
however
disgusted
with
life
and
all
its
specious
allurements
to
whom
so
sudden
and
admirable
a
change
would
not
convey
some
portion
of
elasticity
and
joy
but
there
was
one
thought
that
entirely
occupied
me
i
can
not
describe
how
my
soul
yearned
towards
this
my
only
son
the
sentiment
even
now
as
i
write
is
an
oppression
i
am
scarcely
able
to
sustain
willingly
most
willingly
would
i
have
traversed
every
region
of
the
globe
if
so
i
might
have
discovered
his
unknown
retreat
and
now
suddenly
without
the
smallest
effort
on
my
part
he
was
placed
before
me
his
last
solemn
parting
his
abjuration
of
my
society
and
intercourse
for
ever
rose
to
my
memory
and
gave
a
zest
inexpressible
to
our
present
encounter
at
the
thought
that
my
son
was
in
the
neighbouring
tent
all
earthly
objects
beside
faded
from
my
mind
and
appeared
uninteresting
and
contemptible
i
instantly
resolved
to
devote
myself
to
his
service
and
to
place
all
my
enjoyment
in
the
contemplation
of
his
happiness
and
the
secret
consciousness
of
promoting
it
he
had
if
i
may
so
express
myself
in
my
own
person
forbidden
me
his
presence
in
my
now
altered
figure
i
might
disobey
his
injunction
without
fearing
his
rebuke
let
not
the
reader
condemn
me
that
endowed
as
i
was
with
unlimited
powers
of
action
i
preferred
a
single
individual
my
own
son
to
all
the
world
beside
philanthropy
is
a
godlike
virtue
and
can
never
be
too
loudly
commended
or
too
ardently
enjoined
but
natural
affection
winds
itself
in
so
many
folds
about
the
heart
and
is
the
parent
of
so
complicated
so
various
and
exquisite
emotions
that
he
who
should
attempt
to
divest
himself
of
it
will
find
that
he
is
divesting
himself
of
all
that
is
most
to
be
coveted
in
existence
it
is
not
a
selfish
propensity
on
the
contrary
i
will
venture
to
affirm
that
the
generosity
it
breathes
is
its
greatest
charm
beside
in
my
case
i
considered
my
own
existence
as
blasted
and
i
could
therefore
find
nothing
better
than
to
forget
myself
in
my
son
i
had
made
a
sufficient
experiment
of
the
philosopher
s
stone
and
all
my
experiments
had
miscarried
my
latest
trials
in
attempting
to
be
the
benefactor
of
nations
and
mankind
not
only
had
been
themselves
abortive
but
contained
in
them
shrewd
indications
that
no
similar
plan
could
ever
succeed
i
therefore
discarded
for
the
present
at
least
all
ambitious
and
comprehensive
views
and
believed
that
i
ought
to
be
well
content
if
i
could
prove
the
unknown
benefactor
of
the
son
of
marguerite
de
damville
i
entered
into
a
solemn
engagement
with
myself
that
i
would
forget
and
trample
upon
every
personal
concern
and
be
the
victim
and
the
sacrifice
if
need
were
of
the
happiness
of
my
child
dismissing
my
project
of
becoming
a
factor
for
the
hungarian
people
i
determined
to
lay
aside
the
name
of
chatillon
and
cut
off
every
indication
that
might
connect
my
present
existence
with
that
of
the
rich
stranger
of
buda
one
of
the
advantages
i
possessed
for
that
purpose
was
that
no
creature
in
hungary
had
the
slightest
suspicion
that
the
sieur
de
chatillon
had
ever
been
the
prisoner
of
bethlem
gabor
having
thus
arranged
my
thoughts
i
now
called
for
the
garments
that
had
been
assigned
me
they
were
supplied
me
from
the
stock
of
my
son
and
when
i
had
put
them
on
i
overheard
the
attendants
whispering
to
each
other
their
astonishment
at
the
striking
resemblance
between
their
master
and
myself
when
i
came
once
more
into
the
tent
of
their
captain
and
stood
as
in
the
former
instance
before
his
shield
i
did
not
wonder
at
their
remark
the
coincidence
of
our
features
was
so
great
that
had
we
passed
through
a
strange
place
in
each
other
s
company
i
should
infallibly
have
been
regarded
as
his
younger
brother
yet
there
was
something
of
marguerite
in
the
countenance
of
charles
that
i
wanted
when
i
recovered
as
in
a
short
time
afterwards
i
did
my
vigour
and
health
i
was
more
blooming
than
he
but
there
was
something
graceful
ingenuous
and
prepossessing
in
his
aspect
which
i
could
by
no
means
boast
in
an
equal
degree
and
which
might
have
carried
him
unhurt
and
honoured
through
the
world
we
shall
see
some
of
the
effects
of
this
in
what
i
shall
presently
have
occasion
to
relate
when
my
son
required
of
me
to
declare
who
i
was
i
told
him
as
i
had
already
determined
to
do
that
i
was
a
cadet
of
the
house
of
aubigny
in
france
that
after
having
passed
through
several
other
countries
i
had
come
into
poland
with
the
floating
and
half
formed
purpose
of
entering
as
a
volunteer
against
the
turk
but
that
before
my
plan
was
completely
arranged
having
been
led
by
my
juvenile
ardour
in
a
hunting
party
far
within
the
frontier
of
hungary
i
had
been
so
unfortunate
as
to
become
a
prisoner
to
the
troopers
of
bethlem
gabor
i
added
that
when
introduced
to
their
chief
i
had
given
him
so
much
offence
by
the
firmness
of
my
manner
and
my
refusing
to
comply
with
certain
propositions
he
made
me
that
he
had
thrust
me
into
a
dungeon
from
which
but
for
the
gallant
exertions
of
the
present
detachment
i
should
never
have
come
out
alive
charles
heard
my
story
with
attention
and
interest
he
called
on
me
to
resume
my
courage
and
my
hopes
and
to
be
confident
that
my
sufferings
were
now
at
an
end
he
told
me
that
he
was
a
frenchman
as
well
as
myself
and
like
myself
had
been
a
soldier
of
fortune
he
felt
he
said
a
powerful
sympathy
in
my
tale
there
was
something
in
my
countenance
that
irresistibly
won
his
kindness
and
if
i
would
put
myself
under
his
protection
he
did
not
doubt
to
be
the
means
of
my
future
success
he
spoke
with
great
asperity
of
bethlem
gabor
who
as
an
intrepid
indefatigable
and
sanguinary
partisan
had
been
the
author
of
greater
mischiefs
to
the
christian
cause
than
any
of
the
immediate
servants
of
the
sultan
of
constantinople
he
congratulated
himself
that
the
same
action
that
had
delivered
the
world
from
so
murderous
a
renegado
had
rendered
him
the
preserver
of
a
youth
of
so
much
enterprise
and
worth
as
he
doubted
not
i
should
prove
he
said
there
was
but
one
other
man
in
hungary
who
had
been
so
effectual
an
enemy
to
the
cause
of
truth
and
christianity
as
bethlem
gabor
the
name
of
this
man
he
understood
was
chatillon
and
he
grieved
to
say
that
he
bore
the
appellation
of
a
frenchman
to
the
eternal
disgrace
of
the
nation
that
gave
him
birth
he
had
joined
the
turkish
standard
and
by
exertions
difficult
to
be
comprehended
had
rescued
the
infidels
from
famine
at
a
time
when
but
for
his
inauspicious
interference
buda
and
perhaps
every
strong
town
in
hungary
were
on
the
point
of
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
christians
it
was
this
same
man
who
had
revived
the
resources
of
bethlem
gabor
after
they
had
once
before
by
his
own
fortunate
exertions
been
routed
out
and
whom
i
might
therefore
in
some
sense
consider
as
the
author
of
my
calamities
as
well
as
the
inveterate
foe
of
christendom
such
a
wretch
as
this
was
scarcely
entitled
to
the
common
benefit
of
the
laws
of
war
and
he
would
not
answer
for
himself
if
chatillon
had
fallen
into
his
power
to
what
extremity
his
holy
resentment
against
this
degenerate
might
have
hurried
him
providence
however
had
overtaken
him
in
his
impious
career
and
he
had
fallen
obscurely
as
he
had
lived
basely
in
a
night
skirmish
with
a
party
of
marauders
from
the
austrian
the
reader
may
believe
that
i
did
not
a
little
rejoice
that
in
announcing
myself
a
few
moments
before
i
had
taken
the
name
not
of
chatillon
but
d
aubigny
what
i
heard
however
occasioned
in
me
a
profound
reflection
on
the
capriciousness
of
honour
and
fame
and
the
strange
contrarieties
with
which
opposite
prejudices
cause
the
same
action
to
be
viewed
i
could
not
repress
the
vehemence
of
my
emotions
while
i
was
thus
calumniated
and
vilified
for
actions
which
i
had
firmly
believed
no
malice
could
misrepresent
and
fondly
supposed
that
all
sects
and
ages
as
far
as
their
record
extended
would
agree
to
admire
in
another
point
of
view
the
invective
which
my
son
thus
unconsciously
poured
in
my
ears
had
the
effect
of
making
me
regard
with
a
more
complacent
satisfaction
the
plan
i
had
formed
of
devoting
myself
to
his
service
here
i
pursued
no
delusive
meteor
of
fame
the
very
essence
of
my
project
lay
in
its
obscurity
kings
and
prelates
armies
and
churches
would
no
longer
find
an
interest
in
disputing
about
my
measures
i
should
indulge
the
secret
promptings
of
my
soul
undisturbed
alike
by
the
censure
of
the
world
and
its
applause
it
was
thus
that
under
every
change
of
fortune
i
continued
to
soothe
my
soul
with
delusive
dreams
meanwhile
my
project
went
on
with
the
happiest
auspices
the
friendship
between
me
and
charles
continued
hourly
to
increase
as
a
frenchman
whom
chance
had
introduced
to
his
acquaintance
in
a
distant
country
it
was
natural
that
he
should
feel
a
strong
bias
of
affection
towards
me
but
that
sort
of
fraternal
resemblance
which
the
most
inattentive
spectator
remarked
in
us
operated
forcibly
to
the
increase
of
charles
s
attachment
he
would
often
in
the
ingenuous
opening
of
his
soul
towards
me
call
me
his
brother
and
swear
that
i
should
for
ever
experience
from
him
a
brother
s
love
charles
had
by
this
time
completed
the
year
of
his
age
i
was
in
appearance
at
least
ten
years
younger
than
he
there
is
something
in
this
degree
of
disparity
that
greatly
contributes
to
the
cultivation
of
kindness
and
is
adapted
to
the
engendering
a
thousand
interesting
sentiments
frequently
would
he
exclaim
our
fortunes
my
dear
henry
that
was
the
name
i
assumed
have
been
in
a
considerable
degree
similar
we
were
both
of
us
early
cast
on
the
world
i
indeed
at
the
immature
age
of
seventeen
i
entered
the
world
without
an
adviser
or
a
friend
but
my
destiny
was
favourable
and
i
escaped
its
quicksands
and
its
rocks
i
have
now
by
a
concurrence
of
happy
circumstances
obtained
a
place
among
honourable
men
and
soldiers
and
for
what
is
to
come
may
reasonably
regard
myself
with
some
degree
of
confidence
you
are
yet
in
one
of
the
most
dangerous
periods
of
human
life
your
work
is
all
to
do
your
battles
are
yet
to
fight
suffer
me
my
dear
friend
to
represent
your
better
genius
and
act
an
elder
brother
s
part
you
shall
find
me
no
ignorant
mentor
and
no
ungentle
nothing
could
be
more
gratifying
to
me
than
to
see
the
shoots
of
affection
thus
springing
up
spontaneously
in
charles
s
bosom
i
willingly
humoured
the
generous
deception
that
he
was
putting
on
himself
and
heard
with
transports
inconceivable
his
assurances
of
kindness
and
protection
we
rode
and
we
walked
together
we
were
in
a
manner
inseparable
when
he
went
out
to
reconnoitre
i
was
his
chosen
companion
when
he
inspected
the
discipline
and
condition
of
his
soldiers
he
applied
that
opportunity
to
initiate
me
in
the
science
of
war
when
he
expected
to
encounter
the
enemy
he
placed
me
immediately
by
his
side
sometimes
he
would
open
his
heart
to
me
and
dwell
with
a
melancholy
delight
upon
his
secret
sorrows
it
is
no
wonder
my
henry
he
would
say
that
i
feel
this
uncommon
attachment
to
you
i
am
alone
in
the
world
i
have
no
father
no
mother
and
no
brethren
i
am
an
exile
from
my
country
and
cut
off
for
ever
from
those
of
my
own
lineage
and
blood
it
is
with
inexpressible
delight
that
i
thus
cheat
the
malice
of
my
fate
and
hold
you
to
my
bosom
as
if
you
were
indeed
my
brother
i
would
not
part
with
the
fiction
for
the
mines
of
peru
and
i
know
not
whether
i
do
not
cultivate
it
more
assiduously
and
regard
it
with
a
sentiment
of
more
anxiety
and
zeal
because
it
is
a
fiction
than
i
should
do
if
it
were
a
reality
i
had
indeed
added
charles
a
mother
and
when
he
had
started
this
theme
he
would
dwell
for
ever
on
her
praises
i
easily
saw
that
never
son
loved
a
mother
more
cordially
than
charles
loved
the
marguerite
with
what
sentiments
did
i
hear
her
eulogium
i
could
not
join
in
her
praises
i
could
not
be
supposed
to
know
her
i
stood
there
as
the
statue
of
prometheus
might
have
done
if
after
being
informed
with
a
living
soul
the
gods
had
seen
fit
to
chain
its
limbs
in
everlasting
marble
the
passion
within
me
panted
and
laboured
for
a
vent
but
i
was
invincibly
silent
with
what
sentiments
did
i
hear
her
eulogium
every
word
of
it
was
a
dagger
to
my
heart
every
word
said
and
thou
villain
wert
not
thou
her
murderer
more
painfully
than
the
fiercest
reproaches
could
have
done
when
charles
had
celebrated
with
an
eloquence
truly
divine
this
incomparable
mother
a
sudden
pang
of
memory
would
make
him
start
into
and
this
mother
i
left
of
this
mother
i
can
not
tell
whether
she
is
alive
or
dead
what
shall
i
say
the
crime
or
the
not
less
fatal
error
of
my
father
separated
me
from
this
mother
i
loved
my
father
i
loved
him
because
he
was
my
father
i
had
great
obligations
to
him
he
once
had
virtues
but
my
mother
if
i
could
have
found
her
in
the
wildest
desert
of
africa
and
have
known
her
virtues
a
stranger
to
my
blood
descended
from
the
remotest
tribe
of
the
human
race
i
should
have
chosen
her
for
my
friend
my
preceptress
and
my
guide
beyond
all
that
youth
and
beauty
with
their
most
radiant
charms
could
tender
to
my
acceptance
thus
unconsciously
yet
ingeniously
did
my
dear
son
from
time
to
time
torture
his
father
s
heart
i
could
not
even
deliver
him
from
the
gloomy
and
wretched
uncertainty
whether
this
mother
were
alive
or
dead
with
one
word
i
could
have
composed
his
soul
into
a
sober
grief
i
could
have
said
your
adorable
mother
at
length
rests
from
her
sorrows
she
is
no
longer
the
victim
of
a
misguided
and
a
cruel
father
you
have
no
longer
occasion
to
brood
over
that
most
disconsolate
of
reflections
i
know
not
what
anguish
may
be
at
this
moment
suffered
by
her
who
is
entitled
to
all
my
duty
and
all
my
with
one
word
i
might
have
told
this
and
that
word
i
dared
not
utter
chapter
xliv
my
son
related
to
me
his
history
and
made
me
the
depository
of
his
feelings
and
reflections
the
name
of
leon
indeed
never
passed
his
lips
i
felt
that
he
had
consigned
that
to
inviolable
oblivion
the
appellation
he
bore
in
the
army
was
the
chevalier
de
damville
soon
after
he
abandoned
me
at
dresden
he
had
entered
as
a
volunteer
in
the
imperial
army
charles
the
fifth
was
at
that
time
assembling
forces
to
encounter
the
confederates
of
the
league
of
smalcalde
in
this
situation
my
son
was
eminently
fortunate
he
was
distinguished
for
uncommon
enterprise
and
courage
in
some
of
the
first
actions
of
the
war
and
early
attracted
the
notice
of
castaldo
count
of
piadena
who
held
an
eminent
command
under
the
emperor
in
this
army
my
son
was
a
party
to
the
decisive
battle
of
muhlberg
in
april
four
years
afterwards
castaldo
was
appointed
commander
in
chief
against
the
turks
in
hungary
and
the
french
chevalier
accompanied
his
patron
to
this
new
scene
of
military
enterprise
charles
had
felt
dissatisfied
with
the
grounds
and
motives
of
war
between
the
catholics
and
protestants
of
germany
men
worshipping
the
same
saviour
and
appealing
to
the
same
authorities
but
many
of
them
at
least
from
the
most
upright
and
ingenuous
scruples
differing
in
their
interpretation
of
those
authorities
but
in
their
contentions
between
the
crescent
and
the
cross
he
entered
with
unbounded
enthusiasm
into
all
the
feelings
that
constitute
a
champion
or
a
martyr
he
conceived
that
whatever
was
dear
to
the
human
race
in
this
world
or
the
next
hung
on
the
issue
he
regarded
the
grandeur
of
the
cause
as
purifying
his
efforts
and
consecrating
his
name
and
when
he
lifted
his
sword
in
vindication
of
an
expiring
god
he
felt
himself
steeled
with
more
than
mortal
energy
my
son
dwelt
on
the
merits
of
his
patron
with
a
degree
of
veneration
and
love
that
knew
no
bounds
castaldo
was
ranked
by
the
consenting
voice
of
mankind
with
the
most
accomplished
generals
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
i
knew
him
said
charles
in
his
most
private
hours
and
stood
next
to
and
observed
him
in
the
greatest
and
most
critical
occasions
of
his
life
it
was
the
least
of
his
merits
that
he
distinguished
me
that
he
took
me
up
friendless
and
an
orphan
that
under
every
circumstance
he
was
more
than
a
father
to
me
that
he
corrected
my
faults
that
he
guided
me
with
his
advice
that
he
instructed
me
with
his
wisdom
and
supported
me
by
his
countenance
castaldo
was
the
most
persevering
and
indefatigable
of
mankind
no
difficulties
could
undermine
his
apparent
serenity
no
accumulation
of
dangers
could
appal
or
perplex
him
victory
never
robbed
him
of
his
caution
misfortune
and
defeat
never
destroyed
the
grandeur
and
elasticity
of
his
soul
i
firmly
believe
that
no
general
had
ever
a
more
discouraging
variety
of
counteractions
to
struggle
with
the
enemy
was
barbarous
and
sanguinary
yet
firm
and
undismayed
in
the
full
vigour
of
their
political
health
under
the
rule
of
the
ablest
of
their
sovereigns
the
nobles
of
the
country
castaldo
had
to
defend
had
almost
all
of
them
been
alienated
one
after
another
by
the
tricking
and
politics
of
the
house
of
austria
the
nation
was
ruined
houseless
and
starving
many
of
the
officers
who
served
under
my
general
were
the
basest
of
poltroons
but
they
were
imposed
upon
him
by
his
court
he
was
compelled
to
place
them
in
important
trusts
and
even
when
in
the
most
dastardly
way
they
betrayed
those
trusts
they
were
by
some
pitiful
intrigue
sheltered
from
his
discipline
and
his
justice
the
forces
of
castaldo
were
mutinous
and
ungovernable
and
he
was
almost
constantly
denied
the
funds
requisite
for
their
pay
for
two
years
the
count
of
piadena
struggled
with
these
complicated
difficulties
when
he
had
obtained
a
advantage
at
one
extremity
of
the
kingdom
he
found
it
rendered
useless
by
some
treachery
or
incapacity
in
the
other
extremity
which
it
was
instantly
necessary
he
should
hasten
to
repair
he
quelled
four
alarming
mutinies
by
his
firmness
his
resources
and
the
prudent
combination
of
his
calmness
and
severity
in
the
midst
of
one
of
his
most
arduous
situations
he
suddenly
received
intelligence
that
the
states
of
hungary
which
were
at
that
time
assembled
were
debating
whether
they
should
enter
into
a
treaty
with
solyman
for
the
purpose
of
placing
their
country
under
the
turkish
sceptre
he
immediately
flew
to
the
place
of
council
the
decision
in
favour
of
solyman
was
drawn
up
and
ready
to
be
adopted
but
castaldo
by
his
presence
his
authority
and
his
eloquence
recalled
the
states
to
their
duty
and
prevented
them
from
eternally
staining
the
christian
name
surrounded
with
these
difficulties
opposed
to
an
enemy
many
times
more
numerous
than
the
forces
he
could
bring
against
them
and
whose
wants
were
all
plentifully
supplied
castaldo
by
his
single
abilities
kept
the
balance
even
or
rather
caused
it
to
incline
in
favour
of
the
christian
scale
but
what
added
charles
avails
the
most
consummate
merit
how
may
the
most
incessant
and
undaunted
exertions
be
shadowed
by
the
veil
of
obscurity
the
world
judges
by
events
success
is
necessary
to
procure
the
palm
of
fame
after
two
years
of
such
labours
as
i
witnessed
and
glory
to
describe
a
mutiny
broke
out
among
the
mercenary
troops
more
formidable
than
any
that
preceded
it
was
no
longer
even
in
the
abilities
of
castaldo
to
quell
we
honour
and
respect
you
said
the
mutineers
but
we
will
no
more
serve
without
pay
we
have
been
baffled
two
years
we
will
march
to
the
gates
of
vienna
and
demand
from
ferdinand
our
sovereign
why
we
are
thus
denied
the
arrears
that
are
due
to
they
chose
leaders
for
this
expedition
among
themselves
the
great
castaldo
whose
peculiar
talent
it
is
to
accommodate
himself
to
events
and
never
by
any
misfortune
to
be
deprived
of
his
invention
and
resources
saw
what
it
was
that
became
him
having
in
vain
tried
every
method
for
retaining
his
troops
in
hungary
he
offered
himself
to
lead
them
to
vienna
then
was
seen
the
true
ascendancy
of
a
noble
mind
goaded
with
want
and
distress
they
had
been
deaf
to
the
remonstrances
of
their
general
when
he
sought
to
direct
them
against
the
enemy
but
when
they
saw
him
submitting
himself
to
their
rage
and
impatience
and
fearlessly
intrusting
his
safety
to
those
who
had
before
refused
even
to
listen
to
him
and
who
had
reason
to
fear
his
retribution
as
their
accuser
and
judge
they
were
awed
and
speechless
they
almost
repented
of
their
frenzy
and
were
half
determined
to
return
to
their
duty
their
remorse
indeed
was
imperfect
and
ineffectual
but
castaldo
led
this
band
of
mutineers
through
the
heart
of
the
kingdom
with
as
many
symptoms
of
regularity
modesty
and
order
as
if
they
had
been
the
best
paid
the
promptest
and
most
loyal
army
in
the
my
son
spoke
in
terms
of
the
warmest
enthusiasm
of
the
defence
of
erlau
in
the
period
of
castaldo
s
last
and
most
arduous
campaign
against
the
turks
in
respect
of
fortifications
the
town
was
scarcely
competent
to
resist
the
feeblest
enemy
but
its
deficiency
in
this
point
was
supplied
by
the
constancy
and
valour
of
its
garrison
and
inhabitants
the
very
women
displayed
an
enterprise
that
the
more
vigorous
sex
have
seldom
exhibited
in
one
instance
a
heroine
of
this
sort
was
seen
fighting
in
the
presence
of
her
mother
and
her
husband
her
husband
fell
dead
by
her
side
let
us
my
daughter
said
the
mother
remove
the
body
and
devote
the
rest
of
our
care
to
its
honourable
may
god
returned
the
impassioned
widow
never
suffer
the
earth
to
cover
my
husband
s
corse
till
his
death
has
been
amply
revenged
this
is
the
hour
of
battle
not
a
time
for
funeral
and
for
tears
so
speaking
and
seizing
the
sword
and
shield
of
the
breathless
champion
she
rushed
upon
the
enemy
nor
did
she
quit
the
breach
till
by
the
slaughter
of
three
turks
who
were
ascending
the
scaling
ladders
she
had
appeased
the
fury
in
her
breast
and
the
ghost
of
her
departed
husband
then
raising
the
corpse
and
pressing
it
to
her
bosom
she
drew
it
to
the
great
church
of
the
city
and
paid
to
it
the
last
honours
with
all
possible
magnificence
many
other
examples
of
a
heroism
not
inferior
to
this
were
displayed
on
the
same
occasion
and
shall
i
added
charles
in
a
sally
of
glorious
enthusiasm
ever
desert
a
cause
which
has
been
thus
honoured
shall
i
betray
a
soil
which
has
been
immortalised
by
such
illustrious
actions
shall
i
join
myself
to
the
renegado
bethlem
gabor
and
the
execrable
chatillon
no
such
virtue
as
i
have
described
never
could
have
been
conceived
but
in
the
bosom
of
truth
great
as
is
the
pious
devotion
i
feel
for
that
god
who
died
on
the
cross
for
the
salvation
of
mankind
i
own
my
weakness
if
it
be
a
weakness
his
cause
is
scarcely
less
endeared
to
me
by
the
sublime
exertions
of
his
heroic
followers
than
by
his
own
adorable
condescension
and
mercy
when
the
glorious
castaldo
departed
with
his
rebellious
army
for
the
metropolis
of
germany
there
was
nothing
i
more
earnestly
desired
than
to
accompany
his
march
for
seven
years
he
had
conferred
on
me
the
benefits
and
shown
towards
me
the
affection
of
a
father
and
i
could
not
think
of
being
separated
from
him
without
the
extremest
anguish
beside
i
regarded
it
as
little
less
than
sacrilege
to
quit
his
side
at
a
time
that
he
was
exposed
to
the
furious
suggestions
of
a
host
of
robbers
and
banditti
but
he
would
not
allow
me
to
abandon
my
post
some
time
said
he
we
must
separate
and
you
must
stand
alone
i
have
been
long
enough
your
instructor
and
if
my
lessons
or
my
example
can
produce
improvement
in
you
they
must
have
performed
that
office
he
treated
with
disdain
the
thought
of
the
danger
to
which
he
might
be
exposed
and
his
need
of
a
faithful
guard
a
thought
which
he
had
detected
in
the
midst
of
my
anxieties
but
which
i
had
not
the
courage
to
mention
this
said
he
is
your
genuine
sphere
you
are
a
young
man
burning
with
the
zeal
of
truth
and
religion
you
are
inspired
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
champion
and
a
martyr
heaven
knows
how
willingly
i
would
have
spent
my
blood
for
the
overthrow
of
mahomet
and
his
blasphemous
impieties
to
me
this
is
not
permitted
to
you
it
is
i
shall
be
engaged
in
the
painful
scenes
of
civil
contention
between
christian
and
christian
misguided
and
inflamed
by
the
human
inventions
of
luther
and
of
calvin
you
have
before
you
a
clearer
and
a
brighter
field
and
i
confidently
persuade
myself
you
will
be
found
worthy
of
your
happier
the
count
of
piadena
bestowed
me
so
he
was
pleased
to
express
himself
upon
nadasti
the
great
palatine
of
the
realm
as
the
most
precious
pledge
of
his
friendship
that
it
was
in
his
power
to
confer
since
the
retreat
of
castaldo
the
christian
standard
has
obtained
little
more
either
of
attention
or
aid
from
our
lawful
sovereign
now
the
possessor
of
the
imperial
throne
ferdinand
for
a
great
part
of
this
time
has
had
his
negotiators
at
constantinople
whom
the
insulting
turk
has
condescended
neither
sincerely
to
treat
with
nor
to
dismiss
the
christian
army
in
hungary
has
been
left
to
its
own
resources
but
zeal
has
supplied
the
place
of
magazines
and
religious
ardour
has
taught
us
to
omit
no
occasion
of
annoying
and
distressing
the
enemy
the
most
considerable
occurrence
of
this
period
has
been
the
siege
of
ziget
about
four
years
ago
solyman
taking
advantage
of
certain
factious
broils
among
our
hereditary
nobility
appointed
at
that
time
one
of
his
eunuchs
bashaw
of
buda
and
having
placed
a
numerous
army
under
his
command
dismissed
him
from
the
foot
of
his
throne
with
this

enter

the
christian

of
this

one
of
the
most
accomplished
and
the
bravest
of
our
native
commanders

nadasti

sent
him
a
reinforcement
the
better
to
enable
him
to
support
the
threatened
siege
i
was
in
the
number
of
the
soldiers
appointed
on
this
service
the
trenches
were
opened
early
in
june
and
the
siege
continued
for
the
space
of
seven
weeks
the
bashaw
though
an
eunuch
in
person
stunted
and
of
monstrous
deformity
was
distinguished
for
an
uncommon
degree
of
audacity
and
perseverance
four
times
he
filled
the
dikes
of
the
fortification
with
wood
and
earth
and
as
often
by
means
of
a
furious
sally
of
the
besieged
the
materials
which
had
thus
with
vast
expense
of
industry
and
labour
been
accumulated
were
set
fire
to
and
consumed
on
the
twelfth
day
of
the
siege
he
gained
possession
of
the
town
and
drove
us
back
into
the
citadel
but
on
the
day
following
we
recovered
the
ground
we
had
lost
and
from
that
time
the
town
was
his
no
more
the
actions
of
these
days
were
the
severest
of
the
whole
siege
we
fought
the
enemy
street
by
street
and
inch
by
inch
the
great
fountain
in
the
ran
with
blood
we
ascended
hills
of
the
dead
which
the
infidels
opposed
as
a
barrier
to
our
further
progress
i
seized
two
turkish
standards
and
though
wounded
pursued
the
enemy
through
the
eastern
gate
and
returned
in
triumph
nadasti
in
the
sixth
week
of
the
siege
marched
to
our
relief
but
he
was
met
and
worsted
by
the
bashaw
who
returned
victorious
to
the
foot
of
the
walls
during
the
whole
of
the
siege
mutual
animosity
was
cherished
by
every
species
of
contrivance
and
the
heads
of
the
distinguished
dead
were
exhibited
on
both
sides
as
spectacles
of
abhorrence
and
terror
the
inflamed
passions
of
the
combatants
several
times
found
a
vent
in
listed
duels
horvati
the
governor
killed
in
one
of
these
encounters
a
gigantic
turk
who
had
sent
a
proud
defiance
to
our
host
i
procured
myself
honour
upon
a
similar
occasion
and
the
scarf
which
i
now
wear
composed
the
turban
of
the
infidel
i
slew
at
length
the
disappointed
bashaw
was
obliged
to
raise
the
siege
and
he
soon
after
died
of
grief
and
mortification
in
his
palace
at
buda
i
confess
i
recollect
the
christian
exploits
in
the
defence
of
ziget
in
which
i
also
had
a
share
with
rapture
and
delight
they
will
serve
to
awaken
in
me
new
animation
when
hereafter
the
coldness
of
ordinary
life
might
strike
palsy
to
my
soul
i
shall
never
think
i
have
lived
in
vain
after
having
contributed
in
however
humble
a
place
to
arrest
the
career
of
insolence
and
impiety
which
under
the
standard
of
the
crescent
threatened
to
the
whole
christian
such
were
the
adventures
and
such
the
sentiments
of
the
gallant
chevalier
de
damville
i
had
been
a
warrior
in
my
youth
and
the
discourse
he
held
was
sufficiently
congenial
to
my
earliest
propensities
i
saw
indeed
that
he
had
gained
in
the
zeal
of
a
soldier
of
the
cross
a
source
of
martial
heroism
to
which
my
military
history
had
been
a
stranger
but
though
i
could
not
entirely
enter
into
this
sentiment
of
his
and
indeed
regarded
it
as
an
infatuation
and
delusion
i
did
not
the
less
admire
the
grandeur
of
soul
with
which
this
heroic
fable
inspired
him
there
was
no
present
propensity
in
my
heart
that
led
me
to
delight
in
deeds
of
blood
and
war
i
saw
them
in
their
genuine
colours
without
varnish
or
disguise
i
hated
and
loathed
them
from
my
very
inmost
soul
but
notwithstanding
this
i
was
sensible
to
the
lustre
which
military
zeal
cast
round
the
character
of
my
son
nor
is
this
incredible
or
absurd
the
qualities
of
a
generous
and
enterprising
champion
are
truly
admirable
though
the
direction
they
have
received
should
be
worthy
of
eternal
regret
charles
de
damville
was
my
friend
and
when
i
say
this
i
can
not
help
stopping
a
moment
for
the
indulgence
of
reflecting
on
the
contrast
between
my
present
intercourse
with
my
son
and
my
late
connection
with
bethlem
gabor
i
had
sought
the
friendship
of
the
hungarian
partisan
partly
because
i
wanted
a
protector
and
an
ally
but
partly
also
because
in
my
soul
i
looked
up
to
and
admired
the
man
i
called
bethlem
gabor
my
friend
i
persuaded
myself
that
i
had
cogent
reasons
for
calling
him
so
but
there
was
little
sympathy
between
us
he
was
wrapped
up
in
his
own
contemplations
he
was
withered
by
his
own
calamities
our
souls
scarcely
touched
in
a
single
point
no
no
this
is
not
friendship
friendship
is
a
necessity
of
our
nature
the
stimulating
and
restless
want
of
every
susceptible
heart
how
wretched
an
imposture
in
this
point
of
view
does
human
life
for
the
most
part
appear
with
boyish
eyes
full
of
sanguine
spirits
and
hope
we
look
round
us
for
a
friend
we
sink
into
the
grave
broken
down
with
years
and
infirmities
and
still
have
not
found
the
object
of
our
search
we
talk
to
one
man
and
he
does
not
understand
us
we
address
ourselves
to
another
and
we
find
him
the
unreal
similitude
only
of
what
we
believed
him
to
be
we
ally
ourselves
to
a
man
of
intellect
and
of
worth
upon
further
experience
we
can
not
deny
him
either
of
these
qualities
but
the
more
we
know
each
other
the
less
we
find
of
resemblance
he
is
cold
where
we
are
warm
he
is
harsh
where
we
are
melted
into
the
tenderest
sympathy
what
fills
us
with
rapture
is
regarded
by
him
with
indifference
we
finish
with
a
distant
respect
where
we
looked
for
a
commingling
soul
this
is
not
friendship
we
know
of
other
men
we
have
viewed
their
countenances
we
have
occasionally
sat
in
their
society
we
believe
it
is
impossible
we
should
not
find
in
them
the
object
we
sought
but
disparity
of
situation
and
dissimilitude
of
connections
prove
as
effectual
a
barrier
to
intimacy
as
if
we
were
inhabitants
of
different
planets
it
is
one
of
the
most
striking
characteristics
of
the
nature
of
man
that
we
are
eternally
apt
to
grow
dead
and
insensible
to
the
thing
we
have
not
half
our
faculties
become
palsied
before
we
are
in
the
slightest
degree
aware
that
we
are
not
what
we
were
and
what
we
might
be
there
are
philosophers
who
regard
this
as
the
peculiar
privilege
of
man
a
wise
provision
of
providence
to
render
us
contented
and
easy
with
our
lot
in
existence
for
my
part
i
do
not
envy
and
i
have
never
aspired
to
the
happiness
of
ignorance
and
stupidity
but
be
it
a
blessing
or
a
curse
the
phenomenon
is
undoubted
present
me
with
some
inestimable
benefit
that
my
nature
fitted
me
to
enjoy
but
that
my
fortune
has
long
denied
me
to
partake
and
i
instantly
rise
as
from
an
oppressive
lethargy
before
it
may
be
i
felt
myself
uneasy
but
i
knew
of
no
remedy
i
dreamed
it
was
my
nature
i
did
not
put
forth
a
finger
for
relief
but
now
that
i
have
drawn
the
unexpected
prize
i
grow
astonished
at
my
former
blindness
i
become
suddenly
sensible
of
my
powers
and
my
worth
the
blood
that
slept
in
my
heart
circulates
and
distends
every
vein
i
tread
on
air
i
feel
a
calm
yet
ravishing
delight
i
know
what
kind
of
an
endowment
life
is
to
a
being
in
whom
sentiment
and
affection
are
awakened
to
their
genuine
action
this
was
the
effect
of
the
mutual
attachment
produced
between
me
and
charles
i
looked
into
him
and
saw
a
man
i
saw
expansive
powers
of
intellect
and
true
sensibility
of
heart
to
be
esteemed
and
loved
and
protected
by
such
a
man
to
have
him
to
take
one
by
the
hand
to
enquire
into
one
s
sorrows
to
interest
himself
in
one
s
anxieties
to
exult
in
one
s
good
fortune
and
one
s
joys
this
and
this
only
deserves
the
name
of
existence
i
had
however
a
painful
drawback
upon
my
satisfaction
it
was
my
fate
since
the
visit
of
the
stranger
of
the
lake
of
constance
to
rejoice
for
moments
and
to
lament
for
years
i
could
not
at
first
ascend
to
that
purity
and
eminence
of
friendship
to
forget
myself
i
could
not
but
painfully
feel
the
contrast
between
me
and
my
son
how
happy
was
charles
how
respectable
how
how
cheerful
of
heart
i
shall
presently
have
occasion
to
speak
of
a
still
further
addition
to
his
happiness
i
looked
indeed
young
fair
blooming
a
stranger
to
care
but
i
had
a
secret
worm
gnawing
at
my
vitals
this
very
deceitfulness
of
my
countenance
was
a
bitter
aggravation
to
my
remorse
i
never
saw
my
features
reflected
in
the
polished
shield
without
feeling
myself
struck
to
the
core
charles
had
walked
right
onward
in
the
paths
of
honour
he
feared
no
detection
he
had
no
secret
consciousness
that
gave
the
lie
to
the
voice
of
applause
partiality
and
friendship
but
i
was
all
a
lie
i
was
no
youth
i
was
no
man
i
was
no
member
of
the
great
community
of
my
species
the
past
and
the
future
were
equally
a
burthen
to
my
thoughts
to
the
eye
that
saw
me
i
was
a
youth
flushed
with
hope
and
panting
for
existence
in
my
soul
i
knew
and
i
only
knew
that
i
was
a
worn
out
veteran
battered
with
the
storms
of
life
having
tried
every
thing
and
rejected
every
thing
and
discarded
for
ever
by
hope
and
joy
when
i
walked
forth
leaning
on
the
arm
of
him
who
delighted
to
call
me
his
younger
brother
this
was
the
consciousness
that
hunted
my
steps
and
blasted
me
with
its
aspect
whichever
way
we
turned
chapter
xlv
among
the
various
confidences
reposed
in
me
by
my
son
one
was
his
love
the
object
of
his
attachment
was
a
young
lady
of
quality
named
pandora
niece
to
nadasti
great
palatine
of
hungary
in
consequence
of
the
earnest
recommendation
of
castaldo
in
nadasti
had
taken
my
son
under
his
particular
protection
and
charles
s
principal
home
at
the
periods
when
the
army
was
dispersed
in
was
at
the
palatine
s
house
in
the
city
of
presburg
here
his
manners
had
become
more
polished
and
his
taste
more
refined
till
then
bred
in
tents
and
living
amidst
the
clangour
of
arms
he
had
been
a
mere
soldier
rough
generous
manly
and
brave
but
nadasti
was
an
elegant
scholar
smitten
with
that
ardent
love
of
classical
and
ancient
lore
which
has
so
eminently
distinguished
the
sixteenth
century
he
assembled
round
him
men
of
letters
from
various
parts
of
europe
and
under
his
auspices
the
days
of
matthias
corvinus
king
of
hungary
seemed
to
be
revived
whose
love
of
literature
was
such
that
he
kept
three
hundred
transcribers
in
his
house
constantly
employed
in
multiplying
copies
of
the
precious
relics
of
roman
and
athenian
learning
the
consort
of
nadasti
was
one
of
the
most
accomplished
matrons
of
the
age
in
which
she
lived
and
her
three
daughters
were
patterns
of
every
polite
and
amiable
accomplishment
such
was
the
school
into
which
the
chevalier
de
damville
entered
at
the
age
of
immediately
after
the
retreat
of
castaldo
this
may
seem
an
age
somewhat
late
for
the
character
but
charles
had
an
enterprising
and
aspiring
temper
and
he
soon
became
a
distinguished
ornament
of
courts
and
the
society
of
ladies
castaldo
had
taught
him
all
he
knew
the
temper
the
manners
and
the
science
of
a
military
chieftain
the
palace
of
nadasti
finished
and
completed
the
education
of
my
son
pandora
was
only
fourteen
years
of
age
when
charles
de
damville
first
became
a
sort
of
inmate
of
the
house
of
her
uncle
she
at
that
time
lived
with
her
father
but
he
being
afterwards
killed
in
the
battle
which
nadasti
fought
for
the
relief
of
ziget
pandora
occupied
an
apartment
in
the
palatine
palace
from
the
first
hour
he
saw
her
a
mere
child
as
it
were
accompanied
by
her
governess
charles
confessed
to
me
that
he
had
beheld
her
with
eyes
of
distinction
he
had
said
to
himself
this
little
girl
will
hereafter
be
a
jewel
worthy
of
the
crown
of
an
emperor
he
had
found
something
inexpressibly
attractive
in
the
starry
brightness
of
her
complexion
her
air
he
regarded
as
both
lighter
and
more
graceful
than
any
thing
he
had
ever
before
seen
and
her
speaking
and
humid
eye
seemed
to
him
the
very
emblem
of
sensibility
and
sweetness
if
at
the
girlish
and
immature
season
of
fourteen
he
had
ascribed
to
her
all
these
perfections
it
will
easily
be
supposed
that
as
she
increased
in
stature
as
the
beauties
of
form
unfolded
themselves
in
her
and
she
advanced
in
sentiment
and
a
lovely
consciousness
of
her
worth
the
partiality
of
charles
became
more
deep
and
unalterable
but
the
orphan
niece
of
nadasti
was
altogether
without
a
portion
and
the
great
palatine
would
have
seen
with
more
complacency
the
chevalier
de
damville
addressing
his
pretensions
to
one
of
his
daughters
charles
confessed
to
me
that
the
passion
he
nourished
had
been
fruitful
of
pleasures
and
griefs
of
hope
and
perplexity
it
was
now
almost
a
year
since
pandora
and
himself
had
confessed
a
mutual
affection
the
confession
had
not
been
the
result
of
design
on
either
side
both
had
wished
to
suppress
it
pandora
from
virgin
dignity
and
reserve
and
charles
because
he
saw
not
how
their
affection
could
be
crowned
with
success
and
he
dreaded
more
than
any
misery
to
himself
to
be
the
author
of
degradation
and
misery
to
her
he
loved
but
what
is
ever
uppermost
in
the
heart
will
at
some
time
or
other
betray
itself
their
sympathetic
and
accordant
feelings
upon
a
point
so
deeply
interesting
to
both
rendered
them
to
discern
the
smallest
indications
they
had
had
a
thousand
opportunities
and
a
thousand
opportunities
had
been
resisted
they
became
more
than
usually
silent
and
reserved
towards
each
other
they
shunned
to
meet
and
when
they
met
avoided
each
other
s
eyes
one
day
a
casual
encounter
in
a
solitary
retreat
which
each
had
sought
principally
with
intention
to
escape
the
presence
of
the
other
had
taken
them
off
their
guard
they
were
mutually
hesitating
and
perplexed
each
discerned
more
unequivocal
indications
than
had
ever
occurred
before
of
the
state
of
the
other
s
sentiments
the
entire
accord
snapped
as
it
were
at
once
the
chains
of
reserve
and
each
after
a
short
interval
of
hesitation
spoke
with
an
eloquence
hitherto
untried
the
language
of
love
the
difference
of
years
between
them
gave
a
zest
to
the
communication
pandora
seemed
to
be
throwing
herself
upon
the
protection
of
an
elder
brother
of
a
guardian
one
in
whose
prudence
she
confided
as
the
antidote
of
her
inexperience
charles
felt
his
maturer
years
as
imposing
on
him
more
severely
that
sacred
integrity
the
obligation
of
which
at
least
as
society
is
at
present
constituted
seems
in
the
majority
of
cases
to
grow
out
of
the
relative
situation
of
the
sexes
of
the
protectorship
of
the
one
and
the
dependence
of
the
other
and
now
exclaimed
charles
what
am
i
to
do
what
am
i
to
desire
it
would
be
affectation
in
me
to
conceal
from
myself
on
an
occasion
like
this
that
the
reputation
i
have
acquired
both
in
the
arts
of
peace
and
war
is
such
as
to
have
caused
nadasti
to
set
his
heart
upon
my
becoming
his
the
great
palatine
though
in
many
respects
generous
and
liberal
has
that
inflexibleness
of
opinion
which
is
perhaps
more
apt
to
grow
up
in
the
hearts
of
scholars
than
in
other
departments
of
society
he
is
grave
and
solemn
all
his
habits
are
of
a
majestic
and
lordly
nature
and
i
have
small
reason
to
hope
that
i
shall
find
him
accessible
to
my
representations
he
is
little
subject
to
sallies
of
passion
his
own
propensities
are
wholly
under
the
control
of
his
judgment
and
it
is
not
likely
that
he
will
make
allowance
for
the
ardent
affections
of
other
minds
pandora
is
entirely
dependent
on
him
in
any
case
the
portion
she
would
receive
from
him
would
be
very
inadequate
to
her
worth
but
discarded
and
discountenanced
by
him
who
has
the
absolute
rule
of
christian
hungary
what
can
she
expect
i
am
myself
destitute
of
fortune
my
provision
as
a
soldier
will
be
very
inadequate
to
the
wants
of
the
first
and
softest
of
her
sex
but
even
of
that
provision
nadasti
will
deprive
me
if
i
marry
in
opposition
to
his
pleasure
shall
i
make
pandora
the
inhabitant
of
tents
and
encampments
shall
i
expose
her
to
all
the
changes
and
hazards
of
a
military
life
shall
i
drag
her
as
the
attendant
of
a
soldier
of
fortune
through
every
climate
of
europe
no
by
heavens
i
should
regard
myself
as
the
most
selfish
and
the
basest
of
mankind
if
i
could
deliberate
on
such
a
question
never
shall
the
charmer
of
my
soul
owe
a
single
privation
to
her
charles
i
love
her
with
so
pure
and
entire
a
passion
that
i
prefer
her
prosperity
to
every
earthly
good
nor
is
it
merely
necessary
to
my
attachment
that
she
should
live
in
plenty
and
ease
i
require
that
my
pandora
should
be
seen
in
her
native
lustre
that
she
should
be
surrounded
with
every
appendage
due
to
her
merit
that
she
should
command
applause
from
the
mercenary
and
homage
from
the
superficial
her
praise
is
the
only
music
i
enjoy
i
could
not
bear
to
hear
her
name
coupled
with
levity
and
scorn
i
could
not
bear
that
where
she
appeared
every
eye
should
not
be
turned
to
her
with
reverence
and
honour
my
passion
i
confess
it
is
that
of
a
disciple
of
liberal
arts
and
a
nobleman
not
that
of
an
the
period
of
the
campaign
now
drew
to
an
end
and
charles
having
requested
me
to
accompany
him
set
out
for
his
usual
winter
retreat
in
the
city
of
presburg
i
saw
pandora
never
in
my
life
had
i
beheld
any
thing
so
sweetly
simple
i
had
always
been
an
admirer
of
the
sex
but
the
perfections
of
pandora
were
of
a
nature
that
i
had
not
observed
in
any
other
woman
her
symmetry
was
so
perfect
the
pearly
lustre
of
her
skin
so
admirable
and
her
form
and
carriage
so
light
and
ethereal
that
at
first
view
it
was
difficult
to
persuade
one
s
self
that
she
was
framed
of
the
same
gross
materials
as
the
rest
of
the
species
she
seemed
not
constructed
to
endure
the
shocks
of
the
world
and
the
rude
assaults
of
ill
humour
or
neglect
of
censure
or
adversity
her
voice
was
of
the
sweetest
the
clearest
and
softest
tone
i
ever
heard
there
was
a
peculiar
in
her
accents
that
riveted
your
soul
in
irresistible
fetters
her
conversation
for
in
the
sequel
i
enjoyed
much
of
her
conversation
had
a
very
uncommon
zest
she
seemed
to
have
no
art
and
what
she
uttered
appeared
as
if
wholly
unchecked
by
consideration
or
reserve
you
were
persuaded
that
she
always
delivered
without
restraint
the
first
thing
that
occurred
to
her
mind
yet
in
what
she
said
there
was
so
much
good
sense
so
much
true
feeling
and
as
the
occasion
allowed
so
much
whim
and
imagination
that
you
could
not
discover
how
any
of
her
words
could
be
changed
but
for
a
worse
this
circumstance
strikingly
contrasted
with
the
childish
simplicity
or
rather
the
feminine
softness
and
delicacy
of
her
manner
and
her
tone
the
opposition
of
appearance
between
her
and
my
son
made
a
strong
impression
upon
me
he
was
a
perfect
soldier
with
an
ample
chest
broad
shoulders
and
a
figure
though
graceful
and
well
proportioned
yet
so
strong
that
it
seemed
framed
to
contend
with
and
to
conquer
the
wrestlers
in
the
grecian
games
his
complexion
shaded
with
luxuriant
curls
of
manly
hair
was
itself
made
brown
with
the
rigours
of
climate
pandora
was
so
heavenly
fair
so
sweetly
delicate
and
slender
that
you
would
have
thought
she
would
be
withered
and
destroyed
in
his
embrace
like
the
frailest
ornament
of
the
garden
before
the
northern
breeze
but
courage
to
choose
what
is
rugged
and
manlike
is
often
characteristic
of
the
softest
of
her
sex
i
speedily
contracted
an
intimate
commerce
with
the
beautiful
pandora
i
was
naturally
desirous
to
be
as
consummate
a
judge
as
possible
of
those
perfections
which
i
believed
fated
to
determine
the
future
happiness
of
my
son
when
sufficiently
satisfied
in
that
respect
i
still
continued
the
indulgence
and
found
a
pure
and
exquisite
pleasure
in
the
daily
contemplation
of
accomplishments
that
were
to
prove
the
materials
of
his
gratification
and
delight
whose
gratification
i
preferred
to
my
own
i
had
a
still
further
view
in
this
commerce
i
was
anxious
to
be
perfectly
informed
of
the
connections
and
family
of
pandora
that
upon
them
i
might
build
a
project
i
had
deeply
at
heart
of
bestowing
on
her
in
the
least
questionable
and
exceptionable
manner
a
dowry
that
should
place
her
upon
an
equality
with
her
cousins
the
daughters
of
nadasti
and
deliver
my
son
from
all
apprehension
of
the
unpleasing
consequences
to
result
from
the
resentment
of
the
great
palatine
nadasti
was
opulent
and
the
portions
of
his
daughters
very
considerable
and
however
inclined
i
could
not
exceed
this
limit
without
risking
the
entire
miscarriage
of
my
project
charles
thought
nothing
too
rich
either
in
situation
or
income
to
do
honour
to
the
mistress
of
his
soul
but
separately
from
this
enthusiastic
sentiment
both
he
and
pandora
had
too
just
a
taste
not
to
prefer
the
simple
majesty
of
ancient
nobility
to
the
expensive
ostentations
of
modern
refinement
having
digested
my
plan
i
was
obliged
to
travel
as
far
as
venice
for
the
execution
of
it
the
mother
of
pandora
had
been
a
venetian
and
the
uncle
of
her
mother
was
one
of
the
adventurers
who
had
sailed
with
pizarro
for
the
conquest
of
peru
he
had
died
before
the
completion
of
that
business
and
had
left
behind
him
no
relative
so
near
to
him
in
blood
as
the
lovely
pandora
by
a
singular
piece
of
good
fortune
i
encountered
at
venice
an
individual
who
had
sailed
in
the
same
ship
with
the
young
lady
s
uncle
the
uncle
having
died
prematurely
the
share
he
might
otherwise
have
obtained
of
the
spoils
of
peru
was
sunk
in
the
shares
of
the
rest
and
nothing
was
allowed
to
remain
that
might
have
descended
to
his
heirs
his
friend
and
countryman
i
found
though
once
rich
with
the
booty
he
made
had
by
a
series
of
calamities
before
he
reached
his
native
home
been
reduced
to
a
state
of
poverty
the
vicissitudes
he
experienced
had
produced
in
him
the
effect
of
a
very
uncommon
eagerness
for
acquisition
this
man
i
fixed
on
for
my
instrument
i
opened
to
him
my
plan
and
offered
him
a
very
ample
gratification
provided
he
acted
successfully
the
part
i
assigned
him
in
concert
with
each
other
we
digested
and
forged
the
various
documents
that
were
best
calculated
to
give
credibility
to
the
tale
having
completed
our
arrangement
i
set
out
for
presburg
without
a
moment
s
delay
and
directed
my
venetian
not
to
follow
till
after
a
stipulated
interval
he
was
not
to
enter
into
full
possession
of
his
reward
till
he
had
completed
the
task
he
had
undertaken
it
was
fixed
that
no
person
in
hungary
should
be
acquainted
with
my
visit
to
venice
but
only
be
allowed
to
understand
generally
that
i
had
been
engaged
for
a
certain
time
in
an
excursion
of
amusement
so
hard
is
the
fate
of
the
possessor
of
the
philosopher
s
stone
and
so
limited
his
power
as
to
have
rendered
all
these
precautions
on
my
part
indispensably
necessary
had
not
the
various
circumstances
concurred
the
detail
of
which
is
here
stated
the
birth
of
pandora
s
mother
in
a
maritime
state
the
expedition
of
pizarro
to
peru
her
uncle
s
engaging
in
this
expedition
and
dying
before
it
was
completed
and
my
own
casual
rencounter
with
his
du
my
project
would
too
probably
have
been
baffled
a
direct
gift
of
the
fortune
i
designed
would
never
have
been
admitted
of
and
had
not
the
coincidence
been
eminently
favourable
even
though
i
should
have
succeeded
in
misleading
every
other
party
i
could
not
hope
to
have
eluded
the
perspicacity
and
jealous
honour
of
my
son
when
i
returned
to
presburg
i
again
renewed
my
intercourse
with
pandora
the
passion
entertained
by
damville
for
the
beautiful
orphan
was
a
secret
to
every
person
at
court
they
had
managed
so
discreetly
as
to
have
avoided
every
hint
of
suspicion
and
as
it
was
universally
known
that
the
great
palatine
had
an
eye
on
this
gallant
soldier
for
one
of
his
daughters
few
persons
entertained
a
doubt
that
my
son
would
speedily
declare
his
election
among
the
of
nadasti
on
the
other
hand
in
the
friendly
intercourse
between
me
and
pandora
neither
she
nor
myself
felt
that
there
was
any
thing
to
conceal
and
it
was
therefore
a
matter
of
complete
notoriety
my
blooming
youth
of
appearance
was
remarked
by
the
majority
of
bystanders
we
were
judged
formed
for
each
other
and
before
i
was
aware
the
beautiful
hungarian
was
awarded
to
me
by
the
general
voice
as
my
destined
bride
when
however
i
became
acquainted
with
the
rumour
i
was
contented
to
smile
at
it
the
consciousness
in
my
own
breast
how
far
the
public
sagacity
had
wandered
in
its
guess
gave
to
that
guess
in
my
apprehension
a
certain
air
of
whimsical
and
amusing
chapter
xlvi
such
was
the
situation
of
the
affair
of
pandora
and
i
daily
looked
for
the
arrival
of
my
venetian
confederate
when
suddenly
i
remarked
an
alteration
in
the
carriage
of
my
beautiful
ally
she
had
hitherto
on
all
occasions
sought
my
conversation
she
now
appeared
sedulously
to
avoid
me
her
manner
had
been
characterised
by
the
gaiety
the
sprightliness
and
general
good
humour
incident
to
her
age
and
congenial
to
her
disposition
she
was
now
melancholy
her
melancholy
assumed
a
tone
correspondent
to
the
habits
of
her
mind
and
was
peculiar
and
individual
it
had
an
ingenuous
and
defenceless
air
inexpressibly
calculated
to
excite
interest
it
seemed
to
ask
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
to
be
melancholy
you
felt
for
her
as
for
a
spotless
lily
depressed
by
the
unpitying
storm
you
saw
that
those
enchanting
features
were
never
made
for
a
face
of
sorrow
and
that
that
bewitching
voice
ought
never
to
have
been
modulated
into
an
expression
of
heaviness
i
was
in
the
highest
degree
anxious
to
learn
the
cause
of
this
revolution
and
was
the
farthest
in
the
world
from
suspecting
its
real
foundation
i
pursued
pandora
with
so
much
importunity
and
demanded
an
interview
with
such
irresistible
earnestness
that
she
at
length
consented
to
grant
it
we
met
in
a
remote
part
of
the
garden
why
henry
said
she
do
you
thus
persecute
me
you
are
my
evil
genius
the
cause
of
the
greatest
calamity
that
could
ever
have
overtaken
i
started
for
heaven
s
sake
beautiful
pandora
what
do
you
mean
i
love
the
chevalier
de
damville
i
have
loved
him
long
he
is
dearer
to
me
than
life
and
he
has
cast
me
off
for
ever
and
am
i
the
cause
yes
you
and
you
alone
i
had
for
some
time
observed
a
change
in
his
behaviour
that
he
was
uncommonly
grave
serious
and
reserved
i
endeavoured
to
soothe
him
i
redoubled
my
blandishments
in
our
next
season
of
unreserved
discourse
i
tenderly
enquired
into
the
source
of
his
grief
for
a
long
time
he
resisted
my
importunity
at
length
faithless
girl
said
he
have
you
the
cruelty
to
ask
the
meaning
of
my
depression
this
is
the
extremity
of
insult
is
it
not
enough
that
i
know
your
inconstancy
is
it
not
enough
that
i
have
found
you
like
the
rest
of
your
frivolous
sex
the
mere
slave
of
your
sense
of
sight
regardless
of
vows
regardless
of
an
affection
which
despised
all
interests
but
that
of
tenderness
and
love
caught
by
the
first
appearance
of
something
younger
softer
and
more
courtly
than
i
pretend
or
desire
to
be
will
nothing
satisfy
you
but
the
confession
of
my
unhappiness
from
my
own
mouth
do
you
require
expostulation
intreaty
and
despair
from
your
discarded
lover
to
fill
up
the
measure
of
your
triumph
for
a
long
time
i
was
totally
at
a
loss
to
apprehend
my
dear
chevalier
s
meaning
no
continued
he
i
am
not
jealous
there
is
no
temper
i
hold
in
such
sovereign
contempt
as
jealousy
i
am
not
of
a
disposition
easily
to
conceive
umbrage
or
lightly
to
doubt
the
protestations
of
the
woman
i
adore
i
have
been
blind
too
long
but
i
see
that
you
are
eternally
together
i
see
that
you
take
advantage
of
the
distance
at
which
the
despotic
temper
of
nadasti
keeps
us
from
each
other
to
give
all
your
time
to
my
favoured
rival
you
seem
never
to
be
happy
out
of
his
society
i
was
first
led
to
throw
off
the
dulness
of
my
unsuspecting
security
by
the
general
voice
of
the
public
the
whole
court
gives
you
to
each
other
not
a
creature
it
holds
but
has
discerned
that
passion
which
you
have
the
insolence
to
expect
to
conceal
from
me
since
i
have
been
awakened
from
my
security
i
have
seen
it
a
thousand
times
i
have
seen
your
eyes
seek
and
encounter
each
other
i
have
seen
them
suddenly
lighted
up
by
your
interchanging
glances
i
have
seen
the
signs
of
your
mutual
intelligence
i
have
seen
with
what
impatience
the
moment
you
could
escape
from
the
crowded
circle
you
have
joined
each
other
and
retired
together
ungenerous
pandora
but
do
not
imagine
i
will
enter
the
lists
with
the
gaudy
butterfly
who
has
now
attracted
your
favour
i
have
told
you
already
that
i
am
not
formed
for
jealousy
i
am
not
the
sort
of
man
you
have
supposed
me
to
be
i
have
loved
you
much
i
have
loved
you
long
but
i
would
tear
out
my
heart
from
my
manly
breast
if
i
believed
it
yet
retained
an
atom
of
passion
for
you
i
know
what
it
was
i
loved
i
loved
a
character
of
frankness
of
ingenuousness
of
simplicity
which
i
fondly
imagined
was
yours
but
which
i
now
find
was
the
creature
of
my
own
fancy
the
pandora
that
stands
before
me
the
child
of
art
the
base
wretch
that
could
take
advantage
of
my
forbearance
in
regard
to
her
uncle
which
was
adopted
purely
out
of
love
to
her
the
unfeeling
coquette
that
would
wish
to
retain
me
in
her
chains
when
she
had
discarded
me
from
her
affections
this
creature
i
never
did
love
and
i
never
will
i
know
how
deeply
rooted
the
habit
has
been
in
my
bosom
of
regarding
you
as
the
thing
you
are
not
i
know
how
bitter
it
is
to
a
temper
like
mine
to
detect
so
a
delusion
i
know
what
it
will
cost
me
to
cast
you
off
for
ever
but
i
never
yet
proposed
to
myself
a
conquest
over
my
own
weakness
that
i
did
not
gain
nor
will
i
now
if
you
were
to
discard
this
wretched
d
aubigny
if
you
were
convinced
of
and
contrite
for
your
error
i
must
ingenuously
tell
you
no
time
no
penitence
could
restore
you
to
my
admiration
i
had
set
up
an
imaginary
idol
in
my
bosom
but
you
have
convinced
me
of
its
brittleness
and
dashed
it
to
i
endeavoured
continued
pandora
by
every
imaginable
protestation
to
convince
my
late
faithful
lover
of
his
mistake
but
it
was
to
no
purpose
all
i
could
say
only
tended
to
swell
the
tide
of
his
fearful
be
silent
cried
he
add
no
further
to
the
catalogue
of
your
wanton
and
causeless
delusions
do
not
make
me
hate
too
much
what
i
once
so
blindly
and
ardently
adored
i
feel
that
i
have
an
enemy
within
me
that
would
fain
with
your
deceptions
and
hypocrisy
i
find
that
man
treacherous
to
himself
is
formed
by
nature
to
be
the
fool
of
your
artful
sex
but
i
will
subdue
this
propensity
in
me
though
i
die
for
it
i
may
be
wretched
but
i
will
not
despise
myself
have
i
not
seen
your
falsehood
have
not
all
my
senses
been
witnesses
of
your
guilt
the
miracle
is
that
i
could
have
been
duped
so
long
i
have
heard
this
stripling
lover
of
yours
inexhaustible
in
your
praises
and
dwelling
upon
them
with
an
ardour
that
nothing
but
passion
could
have
inspired
i
have
seen
as
i
have
already
told
you
the
intelligence
of
your
eyes
i
have
seen
those
melting
glances
i
have
heard
those
tender
and
familiar
tones
between
you
that
bespoke
the
most
perfect
confidence
and
the
most
entire
mingling
of
heart
if
i
did
not
believe
this
i
should
believe
worse
of
you
i
should
think
your
heart
not
merely
capricious
but
an
absolute
prostitute
prepared
to
bestow
upon
hundreds
those
sweet
those
nameless
tendernesses
of
accent
and
countenance
which
i
fondly
imagined
were
reserved
for
me
alone
i
should
regard
you
as
the
worst
and
most
pernicious
acquisition
that
could
fall
to
the
lot
of
a
man
go
pandora
added
he
my
heart
is
chaste
my
soul
is
firm
i
can
no
longer
be
deceived
by
you
i
will
not
dispute
your
charms
with
the
idle
boy
you
have
now
thought
proper
to
and
saying
thus
he
burst
from
me
in
an
agony
of
impatience
alas
continued
the
sweet
and
ingenuous
pandora
my
dear
henry
what
shall
i
do
how
shall
i
remove
the
unreasonable
imaginations
of
this
noble
mind
bear
me
witness
heaven
nothing
could
be
more
innocent
than
the
correspondence
i
allowed
myself
to
hold
with
you
my
adorable
charles
was
continually
calling
you
brother
i
scarcely
ever
heard
him
speak
of
you
by
any
other
appellation
i
regarded
charles
as
my
husband
i
already
viewed
you
in
anticipation
as
the
brother
of
my
lord
excluded
as
i
was
from
frequent
conversation
with
him
whom
i
most
loved
i
endeavoured
to
supply
the
deficiency
by
an
unreserved
communication
with
you
the
extreme
resemblance
of
your
persons
increased
my
gratification
you
were
his
picture
his
speaking
image
while
i
looked
at
you
i
said
such
once
was
my
charles
before
he
was
the
great
man
the
gallant
soldier
the
accomplished
cavalier
the
adored
object
that
now
engrosses
my
beside
i
knew
that
charles
loved
you
as
much
as
he
did
any
man
on
earth
and
that
knowledge
made
you
dear
to
me
you
were
constantly
eager
to
dwell
upon
and
describe
his
excellences
could
i
fail
to
be
pleased
with
your
conversation
i
own
that
the
pleasure
i
took
in
it
was
unbounded
and
the
emotions
it
awakened
in
my
affectionate
heart
delicious
but
all
this
candidly
explained
was
only
an
additional
proof
of
the
tenderness
and
constancy
of
my
earliest
attachment
and
now
ever
since
the
fatal
day
in
which
this
conversation
passed
with
my
charles
he
is
absent
from
court
and
i
know
not
whither
he
is
gone
he
has
disdained
to
seek
any
further
explanation
nor
do
i
know
how
to
appeal
to
his
calmer
feelings
and
more
deliberate
mind
one
thing
however
i
had
determined
on
and
that
was
henry
strictly
to
avoid
your
society
i
trust
wherever
my
charles
is
he
will
hear
of
this
i
owe
this
expiation
to
his
agonised
feelings
and
to
the
appearances
that
in
some
degree
justify
his
misconstruction
i
will
wait
patiently
till
the
simplicity
and
singleness
of
my
conduct
have
cleared
my
faith
if
i
should
otherwise
have
found
pleasure
and
relief
in
your
society
i
will
make
a
merit
with
myself
of
sacrificing
this
to
the
apprehensive
delicacy
of
my
charles
s
mind
in
this
single
instance
your
importunity
has
prevailed
with
me
to
dispense
with
my
rule
you
were
not
to
blame
and
i
thought
upon
more
mature
reflection
that
i
owed
you
an
explanation
but
henceforth
if
you
have
any
kindness
for
me
or
value
for
him
who
has
acted
and
felt
towards
you
like
a
brother
i
must
entreat
you
to
with
me
in
this
and
that
whether
in
public
or
private
we
may
bestow
no
notice
on
each
other
and
avoid
all
opportunities
of
communication
to
persuade
you
to
this
was
indeed
a
principal
inducement
with
me
so
far
to
deviate
from
the
rule
i
had
laid
down
to
myself
as
to
admit
this
i
was
extremely
affected
with
the
unhappiness
of
pandora
i
exerted
myself
to
console
her
i
promised
that
nothing
on
my
part
should
be
wanting
to
remove
every
shadow
of
doubt
that
hung
upon
her
fidelity
and
i
exhorted
her
to
believe
that
every
thing
would
infallibly
terminate
in
the
way
most
honourable
and
gratifying
to
herself
pandora
listened
to
me
and
dried
her
tears
the
conversation
was
interesting
and
soothing
to
us
both
we
regarded
it
as
the
last
unreserved
and
sympathetic
communication
we
should
ever
have
with
each
other
it
insensibly
grew
longer
and
longer
and
we
knew
not
how
to
put
an
end
to
it
we
were
still
in
this
state
of
irresolution
when
looking
up
i
perceived
charles
de
damville
approaching
from
the
further
end
of
the
walk
that
led
to
the
alcove
i
would
have
withdrawn
i
was
anxious
to
remove
the
unjust
suspicion
that
hung
upon
his
mind
but
the
instant
that
presented
to
him
so
strong
an
apparent
confirmation
of
them
the
instant
that
by
so
doing
must
have
worked
up
his
soul
into
tumult
did
not
appear
a
favourable
one
for
explanation
to
withdraw
was
impossible
pandora
had
discerned
her
lover
at
the
same
moment
with
myself
she
was
seized
with
a
faintness
she
would
have
sunk
to
the
ground
but
i
caught
her
in
my
arms
i
rested
with
one
knee
on
the
earth
her
head
was
reclined
on
my
bosom
charles
approached
with
a
quicker
pace
rise
said
he
this
is
beyond
my
hopes
i
left
presburg
with
the
purpose
of
not
revisiting
it
for
years
but
as
i
proceeded
further
and
further
from
a
place
which
had
lately
been
the
centre
of
my
affections
i
began
to
doubt
whether
i
had
not
acted
with
precipitation
and
to
believe
that
there
was
yet
some
uncertainty
hanging
on
my
fate
the
seemingly
earnest
protestations
of
this
delusive
syren
rung
in
my
ears
mechanically
without
any
formed
resolution
i
changed
my
course
and
returned
on
my
steps
my
doubts
are
now
at
an
end
i
find
you
taking
instant
advantage
of
my
absence
to
throw
yourselves
into
each
other
s
arms
the
feelings
i
so
lately
uttered
in
your
presence
pandora
would
have
kept
you
apart
if
my
feelings
had
been
in
the
least
sacred
in
your
eyes
if
all
my
surmises
had
not
been
too
he
took
by
the
hand
the
weeping
pandora
and
led
her
to
the
seat
which
a
little
before
she
had
quitted
why
all
this
artifice
why
all
this
deceit
it
is
said
that
we
are
not
masters
of
our
own
hearts
and
that
no
human
passion
is
formed
to
endure
for
ever
influenced
by
these
maxims
i
could
have
pardoned
your
inconstancy
too
fair
too
fickle
pandora
but
why
strain
every
nerve
to
make
me
believe
you
still
retained
a
passion
you
had
discarded
to
subject
me
to
the
lingering
torture
of
deceit
instead
of
communicating
to
me
a
truth
agonising
indeed
to
human
frailty
but
calculated
to
inspire
fortitude
and
decision
this
i
can
not
excuse
this
racks
me
with
the
bitterest
of
disappointments
disappointment
in
the
virtues
i
had
ascribed
to
you
and
convinces
me
that
you
are
neither
worthy
of
me
nor
worthy
of
happiness
and
you
too
d
aubigny
you
have
acted
a
part
in
this
unworthy
plot
i
rescued
you
from
prison
from
a
dungeon
from
which
a
few
hours
before
you
had
no
hope
of
coming
forth
alive
i
took
you
under
my
protection
when
you
had
no
friend
i
placed
you
next
myself
i
conceived
for
you
the
affection
of
a
brother
i
loved
you
next
in
degree
to
the
mistress
of
my
soul
in
return
for
all
that
i
have
done
and
all
that
i
felt
for
you
you
have
with
insidious
heart
and
every
base
disguise
seduced
from
me
the
woman
of
my
choice
why
not
frankly
and
ingenuously
have
demanded
her
at
my
hands
the
heart
is
free
your
reciprocal
passion
though
i
might
have
regretted
it
i
should
have
been
unable
to
blame
it
is
the
cloak
that
you
have
drawn
over
it
that
proves
the
baseness
of
its
origin
do
you
think
i
had
not
the
courage
cheerfully
and
without
a
murmur
to
resign
to
you
this
illustrious
fair
one
i
feel
that
i
was
worthy
to
be
openly
treated
had
i
seen
in
you
a
mutual
and
ingenuous
passion
i
would
not
have
been
the
bar
to
its
just
consummation
i
would
not
have
sought
the
person
of
a
woman
whose
heart
in
spite
perhaps
of
her
better
resolutions
was
given
to
another
i
should
loathe
myself
for
ever
were
i
capable
of
such
a
part
it
was
the
sympathetic
sentiment
towards
me
beating
in
accord
to
the
sentiment
of
my
own
bosom
that
i
once
saw
in
pandora
and
not
either
her
peerless
beauties
or
the
excellences
i
imputed
to
her
mind
that
formed
the
which
fascinated
my
soul
i
feel
that
i
had
the
force
in
the
negation
of
my
own
happiness
to
have
drawn
comfort
and
compensation
from
the
happiness
of
two
creatures
i
so
dearly
loved
as
d
aubigny
and
pandora
but
this
alleviation
in
the
midst
of
what
you
have
condemned
me
to
suffer
you
have
ungenerously
denied
i
sought
to
interrupt
my
son
i
could
no
longer
bear
to
see
him
involved
in
so
painful
an
error
and
not
exert
every
nerve
to
rescue
him
from
it
but
his
passions
were
wrought
higher
than
mine
he
would
not
suffer
me
to
speak
be
silent
d
aubigny
i
can
not
brook
to
be
interrupted
now
my
heart
is
full
and
i
must
have
leave
to
utter
the
sentiments
that
agitate
and
distend
he
advanced
towards
pandora
he
took
hold
of
her
hand
rise
madam
i
shall
not
long
trouble
you
with
the
boisterous
impetuousness
of
my
passions
do
not
resist
me
now
she
rose
and
followed
him
her
face
still
covered
with
her
handkerchief
and
drowned
in
tears
he
led
her
to
the
front
of
the
alcove
he
motioned
me
to
approach
with
his
other
hand
he
took
hold
of
mine
he
seemed
to
lift
pandora
s
hand
to
his
lips
as
if
to
kiss
it
with
a
sudden
start
he
put
it
down
again
he
held
it
below
the
level
of
his
breast
during
this
scene
pandora
and
myself
were
speechless
most
women
in
the
situation
of
pandora
would
i
suppose
have
spoken
and
have
been
eager
to
vindicate
themselves
from
so
groundless
an
imputation
but
what
she
did
was
peculiar
to
the
delicacy
and
defencelessness
of
her
personal
character
she
was
overwhelmed
and
incapable
of
effort
for
my
own
part
my
feelings
were
uncommonly
complicated
my
apparent
situation
was
a
plain
one
the
situation
of
a
youth
mistaken
by
his
friend
for
the
seducer
of
the
mistress
of
that
friend
and
had
my
feelings
been
merely
relative
to
this
situation
i
could
undoubtedly
have
spoken
without
embarrassment
but
with
this
were
involved
the
sentiments
originating
in
my
secret
character
the
sentiments
of
a
man
anxious
to
benefit
and
who
had
devoted
himself
to
the
interests
of
another
of
a
father
tremblingly
alive
to
the
happiness
of
his
son
and
eager
to
dive
into
his
soul
that
he
might
the
more
sensibly
admire
his
virtues
and
with
a
more
enlightened
skill
secure
his
fortune
i
was
silent
charles
de
damville
proceeded
thus
said
he
i
join
your
hands
thus
i
withdraw
all
my
claims
upon
pandora
thus
i
remove
every
impediment
to
your
wishes
this
pandora
this
d
aubigny
i
was
capable
of
if
you
had
treated
me
honourably
and
avowed
an
honest
passion
you
do
not
know
charles
de
damville
you
have
treated
me
as
none
but
the
most
groveling
soul
could
deserve
to
be
treated
had
you
been
ingenuous
i
should
have
a
consolation
in
what
i
am
doing
that
now
i
can
not
have
i
can
no
longer
persuade
myself
that
i
am
joining
two
worthy
hearts
to
each
other
i
can
no
longer
relieve
the
bitterness
of
my
own
disappointment
by
the
image
of
your
future
felicity
may
i
be
mistaken
may
you
be
truly
happy
in
each
other
you
can
not
be
happy
beyond
the
wishes
formed
in
your
favour
by
him
who
will
remember
to
the
latest
hour
of
his
existence
how
much
his
heart
was
devoted
to
you
saying
this
he
burst
away
from
us
abruptly
and
disappeared
at
first
as
i
listened
to
the
heroic
language
of
my
son
i
asked
myself
whether
it
were
the
expression
of
a
warm
heart
or
a
cold
one
it
costs
nothing
to
a
cold
heart
to
ape
the
language
of
heroism
and
to
pretend
to
make
the
greatest
sacrifices
when
its
constitution
has
rendered
all
effort
unnecessary
to
the
feat
but
i
looked
in
the
face
of
charles
and
forgot
my
doubts
his
voice
he
had
indeed
wound
up
to
the
tone
of
his
speech
it
was
a
little
tremulous
but
in
the
main
firm
serious
deliberate
and
elevated
but
his
countenance
was
the
picture
of
distress
there
sat
enthroned
defying
all
banishment
and
disguise
the
anguish
of
his
soul
his
eye
was
haggard
his
complexion
was
colourless
and
wan
he
had
been
absent
several
days
from
presburg
his
appearance
told
me
that
he
could
scarcely
either
have
eaten
or
slept
during
the
period
of
his
absence
he
might
talk
of
the
generosity
with
which
he
could
resign
pandora
i
read
in
his
face
what
that
resignation
had
cost
and
would
go
on
to
cost
him
ingenuous
charles
i
doubted
whether
but
for
a
reverse
of
the
events
he
apprehended
he
would
be
able
to
survive
it
he
had
no
sooner
left
us
than
i
applied
myself
to
comfort
pandora
i
swore
to
her
that
in
spite
of
every
temporary
cloud
i
would
yet
witness
the
union
of
her
and
her
adored
chevalier
i
assured
her
that
i
would
not
rest
till
i
had
forced
damville
to
hear
me
and
compelled
him
to
credit
the
sincerity
of
my
tale
how
many
things
were
there
that
in
the
scene
which
had
just
passed
i
might
have
urged
in
answer
to
damville
but
respecting
which
my
situation
imposed
upon
me
the
most
rigorous
silence
i
might
have
said
you
call
yourself
my
protector
my
benefactor
my
patron
the
real
relation
between
us
is
the
reverse
of
the
picture
you
have
drawn
i
want
not
your
protection
i
am
qualified
if
i
please
to
be
a
patron
to
all
the
world
i
am
meditating
the
most
generous
things
in
your
behalf
this
perfidious
friend
as
you
deem
him
has
devoted
all
his
thoughts
and
postponed
all
his
gratifications
that
he
might
prove
himself
substantially
and
in
the
most
important
particulars
your
more
than
this
i
might
have
said
i
might
have
said
i
am
your
father
i
have
no
inclinations
no
passions
contravening
your
gratification
i
love
you
with
more
than
a
father
s
love
i
transfer
to
you
all
the
affection
i
entertained
for
your
peerless
murdered
mother
all
my
study
is
your
happiness
you
are
to
me
the
whole
world
and
more
than
the
whole
world
extensive
and
singular
as
are
my
prerogatives
i
fold
them
up
i
forget
them
all
and
think
of
you
i
can
not
give
a
stronger
proof
than
is
contained
in
what
i
have
here
stated
of
the
misery
of
my
condition
i
was
cheated
as
i
have
once
before
remarked
with
the
form
of
a
man
but
had
nothing
of
the
substance
i
was
endowed
with
the
faculty
of
speech
but
was
cut
off
from
its
proper
and
genuine
use
i
was
utterly
alone
in
the
world
separated
by
an
insurmountable
barrier
from
every
being
of
my
species
no
man
could
understand
me
no
man
could
sympathise
with
me
no
man
could
form
the
remotest
guess
at
what
was
passing
in
my
breast
i
had
the
use
of
words
i
could
address
my
i
could
enter
into
dialogue
with
them
i
could
discourse
of
every
indifferent
thing
that
the
universe
contained
i
could
talk
of
every
thing
but
my
own
feelings
this
and
not
the
dungeon
of
bethlem
gabor
is
the
true
solitude
let
no
man
after
me
pant
for
the
acquisition
of
the
philosopher
s
stone
charles
de
damville
had
again
left
presburg
the
very
instant
he
quitted
the
alcove
when
i
inquired
for
him
in
the
palace
i
received
this
afflicting
intelligence
i
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
in
resolving
that
i
would
pursue
his
steps
it
was
of
the
utmost
consequence
that
i
should
overtake
him
all
that
was
most
interesting
to
me
hung
upon
our
interview
the
preparations
however
of
my
journey
though
followed
with
ardour
inevitably
reduced
me
to
the
being
some
hours
in
the
rear
of
my
son
i
was
continually
in
his
track
but
could
not
come
up
with
him
to
judge
from
events
you
would
have
supposed
that
he
had
as
strong
a
motive
to
fly
as
i
had
to
pursue
he
led
me
along
the
course
of
the
danube
to
the
source
of
that
and
munificent
river
i
reached
the
passage
of
the
rhine
and
was
on
the
point
of
crossing
into
alsace
but
here
i
lost
all
notice
of
charles
no
enquiry
i
could
make
was
effectual
to
procure
me
the
slightest
intelligence
he
had
not
crossed
the
river
he
had
proceeded
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
along
its
banks
i
was
disappointed
mortified
and
distressed
what
was
i
to
do
next
could
i
return
to
pandora
what
tale
must
i
relate
to
this
adorable
creature
whom
i
had
urged
to
depend
upon
my
exertions
could
i
leave
her
however
to
the
anguish
and
uncertainty
that
must
follow
upon
her
hearing
no
more
either
from
her
lover
or
myself
i
think
i
never
felt
more
truly
depressed
than
in
this
conjuncture
most
amply
most
critically
did
the
curse
of
the
attend
upon
my
projects
and
render
all
my
exertions
abortive
it
was
the
same
whether
my
plans
were
formed
upon
a
larger
or
a
smaller
scale
when
i
endeavoured
to
live
in
total
obscurity
in
madrid
when
i
undertook
to
be
the
steward
and
the
father
of
the
people
of
hungary
and
now
that
with
a
chastised
ambition
i
sought
what
is
permitted
to
all
other
human
creatures
to
provide
for
the
honourable
settlement
of
my
only
son
still
still
my
evil
genius
pursued
me
and
blasted
every
concern
in
which
i
presumed
to
interfere
i
had
intruded
between
two
faithful
lovers
unfortunate
they
had
been
indeed
and
considerable
obstacles
were
interposed
to
their
felicity
but
obstacles
are
commonly
found
to
yield
to
firmness
and
constancy
and
without
my
fatal
interference
charles
and
pandora
would
one
day
have
been
happy
if
by
adverse
fates
they
had
hitherto
been
kept
asunder
still
they
understood
each
other
and
rejoiced
in
their
mutual
confidence
and
attachment
this
the
consolation
of
all
their
sorrows
and
disappointments
it
was
mine
to
have
destroyed
the
globe
for
aught
i
knew
would
speedily
be
interposed
between
them
and
here
i
stood
in
the
middle
point
like
one
of
those
invincible
repulsive
powers
hid
in
the
storehouse
of
nature
forbidding
to
them
all
future
retrogression
to
each
other
chapter
xlvii
the
picture
which
my
distracted
fancy
thus
set
before
the
eye
of
my
mind
was
not
altogether
verified
in
the
event
after
a
thousand
fruitless
inquiries
and
perquisitions
i
found
to
my
utter
astonishment
that
charles
arresting
his
career
at
the
town
of
fribourg
had
returned
upon
his
steps
and
sought
a
second
time
the
metropolis
of
austrian
hungary
this
was
of
the
class
of
those
events
which
we
sometimes
meet
with
in
the
world
that
baffle
all
calculation
and
strike
us
like
magic
or
like
madness
in
their
authors
i
had
nothing
to
do
as
i
conceived
on
this
occasion
but
to
follow
the
example
of
my
son
and
like
him
to
resume
the
route
of
presburg
i
yet
hoped
to
witness
if
not
to
in
the
reconciliation
of
charles
and
pandora
my
spirits
in
this
respect
were
revived
and
my
prospects
made
brighter
by
the
thoughts
that
these
virtuous
and
meritorious
lovers
were
at
last
likely
to
be
once
again
inclosed
within
the
cincture
of
the
same
city
add
to
which
my
venetian
confederate
had
not
yet
made
his
appearance
at
presburg
and
not
only
was
i
under
engagements
to
give
him
the
meeting
there
but
it
was
also
clear
that
his
errand
could
not
be
brought
to
its
proper
close
without
my
assistance
i
once
more
entered
the
city
to
which
pandora
owed
her
birth
charles
de
damville
had
preceded
my
arrival
several
days
i
should
without
delay
have
repaired
to
his
apartments
but
that
i
found
at
my
own
lodgings
a
letter
from
benedetto
cabriera
of
venice
informing
me
that
he
was
now
in
presburg
and
to
avoid
all
cause
for
suspicion
had
taken
up
his
residence
in
a
remote
quarter
of
the
town
from
the
enquiries
i
made
i
became
satisfied
that
my
son
had
in
some
degree
resumed
his
usual
occupations
and
that
there
was
no
appearance
of
his
again
immediately
quitting
the
metropolis
i
therefore
felt
my
transaction
with
cabriera
more
urgent
than
an
immediate
conference
with
charles
though
i
had
sought
that
conference
with
earnest
expedition
yet
i
dreaded
it
it
might
require
the
maturest
consideration
and
the
nicest
management
to
render
it
effectual
for
the
purposes
i
sought
i
found
from
certain
intelligence
that
damville
and
pandora
had
yet
had
no
explanation
with
each
other
i
therefore
regarded
my
exertions
for
that
purpose
as
a
final
effort
and
i
was
willing
that
every
thing
should
be
in
train
and
the
portion
of
pandora
fully
adjusted
before
i
entered
upon
that
interesting
scene
with
cabriera
i
had
little
difficulty
the
documents
and
evidences
of
his
tale
we
had
concerted
at
venice
and
i
presently
found
that
he
told
his
story
so
plausibly
and
supported
it
so
consistently
that
it
was
admitted
by
every
one
without
the
smallest
suspicion
no
sooner
had
cabriera
opened
his
business
to
the
parties
to
whom
the
cognisance
of
it
most
properly
belonged
than
i
once
more
presented
myself
to
the
beautiful
and
engaging
niece
of
nadasti
the
instant
i
entered
her
apartment
i
was
shocked
with
the
extreme
change
of
her
personal
appearance
all
the
airiness
alertness
and
vivacity
that
had
once
so
exquisitely
adorned
her
were
gone
the
roses
in
her
cheek
were
faded
and
had
given
place
to
a
delicate
but
sickly
paleness
her
arms
though
always
what
is
called
white
had
before
been
round
and
had
been
distinguished
by
the
purest
hue
of
health
they
were
now
emaciated
skinny
and
colourless
her
eyes
were
hollow
and
her
eyelids
inflamed
with
weeping
all
these
changes
had
taken
place
in
about
five
weeks
that
had
elapsed
since
i
saw
her
last
i
was
so
struck
with
the
sight
that
i
involuntarily
started
and
could
scarcely
command
myself
enough
to
refrain
from
tears
it
was
plain
that
she
carried
an
arrow
in
her
bosom
which
one
hand
only
in
the
universe
could
extract
with
safety
as
i
approached
she
raised
her
lovely
head
that
had
been
depressed
with
grief
and
lifted
her
white
arms
with
an
expression
of
despair
come
nearer
my
sweet
henry
said
she
i
rejoice
to
see
you
though
you
have
proved
my
worst
enemy
the
destroyer
of
my
peace
but
your
intentions
my
kind
boy
my
brother
for
such
i
will
still
call
you
have
always
been
good
and
innocent
but
ah
henry
you
have
deluded
me
you
urged
me
to
banish
despair
and
every
day
i
see
more
reason
to
i
asked
if
she
had
not
seen
the
chevalier
since
his
return
to
presburg
it
were
better
for
me
replied
pandora
if
i
had
not
seen
him
what
has
really
happened
is
worse
than
if
i
had
been
denied
to
see
him
i
have
met
him
every
day
in
the
apartments
of
my
aunt
to
an
indifferent
eye
it
would
have
appeared
as
if
he
neither
sought
nor
avoided
me
he
carries
himself
towards
me
with
a
cold
and
constrained
civility
but
he
neither
demands
an
interview
nor
allows
me
the
opportunity
to
utter
a
word
to
him
in
private
oh
d
aubigny
i
see
too
well
that
i
have
lost
him
for
ever
when
he
fled
my
presence
when
he
resolved
to
seek
some
distant
region
cruel
as
that
conduct
was
it
convinced
me
that
i
was
of
some
importance
to
him
but
now
he
passes
by
me
in
stern
neglect
he
has
utterly
driven
me
from
his
heart
indeed
my
brother
this
last
blow
is
too
much
i
feel
that
i
shall
never
recover
and
does
the
chevalier
cried
i
appear
at
his
ease
does
he
exhibit
the
wonted
symptoms
of
his
health
and
triumphant
spirit
away
too
pleasing
deluder
replied
pandora
cheat
me
not
with
false
hopes
flatter
me
not
with
unreal
expectations
damville
does
not
appear
to
be
well
or
happy
but
you
have
deceived
me
too
much
the
disappointments
that
you
prepared
for
me
are
too
excruciating
i
feel
now
at
no
time
so
high
a
degree
of
gloomy
satisfaction
and
composure
as
when
i
press
despair
firmly
to
my
breast
but
you
henry
continued
she
are
probably
uninformed
of
my
last
and
severest
misfortune
i
had
a
great
uncle
in
the
list
of
the
adventurers
that
achieved
the
conquest
of
peru
he
has
died
and
unexpectedly
bequeathed
me
a
fortune
that
sets
the
portionless
pandora
upon
a
level
with
the
wealthy
heiresses
of
the
great
palatine
himself
for
a
long
time
want
of
fortune
was
the
only
obstacle
that
stood
between
me
and
all
my
hopes
of
happiness
now
that
poverty
is
no
longer
an
evil
to
me
and
wealth
no
longer
desirable
i
have
obtained
this
unwelcome
acquisition
you
can
have
no
conception
how
painful
a
sensation
is
produced
by
this
mockery
the
gift
of
ample
possessions
to
the
votary
of
i
endeavoured
somewhat
to
encourage
pandora
but
she
obstinately
rejected
my
soothings
i
was
the
less
importunate
on
this
subject
as
since
the
return
of
my
son
i
persisted
to
persuade
myself
that
i
should
soon
have
something
more
substantial
to
offer
her
on
his
part
than
mere
guesses
and
conjectures
the
day
after
this
conversation
i
boldly
sought
the
presence
of
the
chevalier
till
then
i
had
since
our
return
to
presburg
avoided
to
meet
him
i
now
resolved
to
force
from
him
a
hearing
to
assure
him
with
the
most
solemn
asseverations
of
my
own
innocence
and
the
constancy
of
his
mistress
to
represent
to
him
in
how
eminent
a
degree
the
newly
acquired
estate
of
pandora
was
calculated
to
facilitate
their
mutual
wishes
and
finally
to
offer
him
any
pledge
he
should
desire
of
the
sincerity
of
my
declarations
even
to
the
banishing
myself
from
the
presence
and
intercourse
of
him
and
the
lovely
pandora
for
ever
when
i
saw
my
son
his
appearance
and
air
advanced
a
forcible
claim
on
my
compassion
i
will
not
now
describe
them
suffice
it
that
they
completely
proved
how
true
was
the
sympathy
even
to
the
minutest
particulars
between
him
and
his
mistress
the
difference
was
only
in
kind
and
not
in
degree
hers
a
defenceless
a
delicate
and
truly
feminine
grief
while
his
amidst
all
its
aggravations
had
something
in
it
of
the
champion
and
the
hero
when
he
felt
most
severely
he
seemed
to
disdain
himself
for
what
he
felt
and
though
his
struggles
were
excruciating
he
resolutely
smoothed
his
manly
front
and
the
loftiness
of
his
spirit
produced
on
his
cheek
a
generous
and
a
settled
blush
i
have
just
said
that
i
had
resolved
to
force
from
him
a
hearing
i
was
mistaken
in
my
calculations
on
this
point
dejected
as
his
habits
had
lately
been
he
no
sooner
saw
me
than
he
advanced
towards
me
with
a
fierce
and
imperative
demeanour
that
absolutely
startled
me
how
is
it
man
cried
he
that
you
are
at
this
hour
out
of
custody
custody
interdicted
and
astonished
repeated
i
yes
custody
if
such
a
wretch
as
thou
art
be
permitted
to
go
at
large
what
human
institution
what
human
possessions
shall
ever
be
secure
good
god
said
i
what
am
i
to
understand
by
your
present
rage
i
know
that
you
have
considered
me
as
your
personal
enemy
and
the
underminer
of
your
happiness
but
when
first
you
accused
me
of
this
crime
you
treated
me
in
a
manner
less
violent
and
disdainful
than
that
which
you
now
i
brook
not
to
explain
read
that
letter
i
received
it
at
fribourg
that
letter
brought
me
back
from
the
confines
of
france
to
the
spot
where
now
we
i
took
up
the
letter
its
contents
were
nearly
as
follow
letter
my
dear
friend
you
will
permit
me
to
call
you
so
since
to
me
and
me
only
you
have
recently
thought
proper
to
confide
your
projects
and
your
unfortunate
passion
for
the
charming
pandora
what
you
related
to
me
on
the
subject
convinced
me
how
much
she
was
unworthy
of
your
love
and
how
basely
she
has
conducted
herself
towards
you
yet
you
will
yourself
feel
some
compassion
for
her
when
you
learn
who
it
is
upon
whom
she
has
bestowed
this
unmerited
preference
know
then
that
this
wretched
d
aubigny
is
no
other
than
the
notorious
chatillon
the
infamous
impostor
who
by
his
machinations
about
a
year
ago
preserved
the
turkish
provinces
of
hungary
from
being
conquered
by
the
christian
arms
the
man
is
moreover
a
magician
the
pretended
or
real
possessor
of
the
philosopher
s
stone
he
is
therefore
doubly
worthy
of
death
first
as
a
traitor
the
abettor
and
comforter
of
the
common
enemy
of
the
christian
faith
and
secondly
as
a
dealer
in
the
black
art
and
a
man
notoriously
sold
and
delivered
over
to
the
devil
i
have
received
this
information
from
the
most
unquestionable
authority
a
soldier
in
my
old
corps
who
has
lately
escaped
from
a
turkish
prison
no
sooner
saw
him
than
he
identified
his
person
i
happened
to
be
near
the
fellow
at
the
moment
when
by
an
unexpected
exclamation
he
betrayed
his
discovery
it
immediately
struck
me
that
the
circumstance
might
be
of
importance
to
your
interests
and
therefore
taking
the
soldier
aside
i
charged
him
not
to
mention
to
any
one
what
he
had
observed
to
render
his
secrecy
the
more
secure
i
have
since
removed
him
to
a
garrison
at
some
distance
from
presburg
and
i
have
myself
mentioned
the
circumstance
to
no
living
creature
that
i
might
first
receive
your
instructions
on
the
subject
and
act
in
all
respects
concerning
it
as
you
shall
judge
proper
the
blackness
of
the
character
of
the
man
sets
all
exaggeration
at
defiance
this
very
individual
whom
you
liberated
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
who
by
the
most
treacherous
arts
won
your
confidence
and
upon
whom
you
lavishly
heaped
every
imaginable
distinction
was
all
the
while
conscious
to
himself
that
he
was
the
character
that
of
all
that
live
you
hated
most
in
one
word
the
renegado
chatillon
he
acted
consistently
with
his
preceding
conduct
and
his
recent
disingenuousness
when
he
seduced
from
you
the
affections
of
the
woman
of
your
choice
i
am
concerned
to
add
that
on
the
very
day
that
i
made
this
discovery
this
chatillon
d
aubigny
disappeared
from
presburg
nor
can
i
by
any
effort
learn
whither
he
is
gone
it
is
impossible
he
should
have
been
informed
by
any
human
means
of
the
detection
that
had
happened
but
indeed
it
is
vain
to
attempt
to
form
any
reasonable
conjecture
respecting
a
character
so
mysterious
and
inexplicable
your
devoted
friend
andrew
count
of
well
sir
seeing
i
had
finished
the
perusal
and
what
have
you
now
to
allege
when
i
saw
you
simply
as
the
favoured
lover
of
pandora
however
treacherous
and
dishonourable
i
might
deem
your
conduct
towards
me
i
quitted
the
field
i
did
not
trust
myself
to
be
a
judge
in
my
own
cause
i
did
not
confide
in
my
estimate
of
your
unworthiness
when
i
was
myself
wholly
concerned
i
had
some
time
before
received
an
invitation
from
the
duke
d
aumale
who
was
collecting
a
number
of
generous
and
nobles
to
accompany
mary
queen
of
scots
to
the
barbarous
fields
of
her
native
realm
i
at
first
declined
i
now
accepted
the
invitation
i
set
out
for
paris
to
join
him
i
found
that
letter
waiting
my
arrival
at
fribourg
and
i
returned
deeply
as
pandora
has
sunk
in
my
esteem
i
determined
i
would
never
allow
her
to
be
thrown
away
upon
the
infamous
chatillon
you
haunt
my
steps
i
heard
of
you
again
and
again
on
my
route
as
i
returned
from
fribourg
i
arrive
at
presburg
and
presently
after
you
again
make
your
appearance
what
further
villanies
have
you
to
act
what
new
treacheries
have
you
devised
against
me
this
morning
i
consented
to
the
representations
of
count
bathori
and
agreed
that
you
should
be
delivered
up
to
justice
why
then
are
you
not
in
custody
when
i
consider
the
mystery
and
inscrutableness
of
your
character
i
am
lost
in
conjecture
you
are
said
to
be
a
magician
a
dealer
in
the
unhallowed
secrets
of
alchymy
and
the
in
cases
like
this
all
the
ordinary
rules
of
human
sagacity
and
prudence
are
superseded
the
wisest
man
is
a
fool
and
the
noblest
spirit
feels
the
very
ground
he
stood
on
struck
from
under
his
feet
how
can
i
know
that
the
seduction
of
pandora
s
affections
is
not
owing
to
magical
incantations
who
in
that
case
is
rather
an
object
for
compassion
than
for
censure
how
can
i
tell
that
the
fraternal
resemblance
borne
by
your
features
to
my
own
and
the
sudden
and
ardent
partiality
that
rose
in
my
breast
when
first
i
saw
you
have
not
been
produced
by
the
most
detested
arts
magic
dissolves
the
whole
principle
and
arrangement
of
human
action
subverts
all
generous
enthusiasm
and
dignity
and
renders
life
itself
loathsome
and
intolerable
this
is
to
me
the
most
painful
of
all
subjects
i
had
a
father
whom
i
affectionately
loved
he
became
the
dupe
of
these
infernal
secrets
i
had
a
mother
the
paragon
of
the
creation
that
father
murdered
her
all
the
anguish
i
ever
felt
has
derived
its
source
from
alchymy
and
magic
while
the
infamous
chatillon
thus
stands
before
me
i
feel
all
the
wounds
of
my
heart
new
opened
and
the
blood
bursting
afresh
from
every
vein
i
have
rested
and
been
at
peace
and
now
the
red
and
venomed
plague
that
tarnished
the
years
of
my
opening
youth
returns
to
blast
me
begone
infamous
villain
and
let
me
never
see
thee
more
wretch
that
you
are
continued
charles
for
he
saw
me
motioning
to
withdraw
i
felt
that
all
further
expostulation
and
discussion
on
my
part
was
useless
wretch
that
you
are
what
is
it
that
you
are
about
to
do
think
no
to
escape
my
vengeance
in
the
midst
of
all
the
tumultuous
passions
you
waken
in
my
breast
i
still
feel
in
myself
the
soldier
and
the
man
of
honour
i
am
not
a
or
a
bailiff
you
are
within
my
power
and
that
is
your
present
protection
i
will
not
now
deliver
you
up
to
the
justice
of
the
state
but
will
hurl
against
you
my
personal
defiance
i
am
willing
to
meet
you
man
to
man
i
thirst
to
encounter
you
as
my
worst
and
most
mortal
foe
who
has
perpetrated
against
me
the
basest
injuries
and
excited
in
my
bosom
the
most
hateful
sensations
though
you
were
fenced
with
all
the
legions
of
hell
i
fear
you
not
and
seeing
that
after
all
that
is
past
you
have
once
again
intruded
into
my
presence
i
here
bind
myself
by
all
that
is
sacred
to
pursue
you
to
the
what
could
i
answer
to
such
an
attack
i
saw
at
once
that
the
case
as
to
all
future
harmony
between
me
and
my
son
was
desperate
and
irremediable
what
hope
could
i
entertain
further
what
had
hitherto
been
the
result
of
our
intercourse
every
offence
and
prejudice
that
can
gall
the
human
mind
had
been
brought
forward
in
it
in
turn
i
had
wounded
damville
in
the
most
sensible
point
of
private
life
and
had
blasted
his
hopes
there
where
he
stored
them
all
i
had
offended
his
most
rooted
political
prepossessions
by
aiding
the
turk
and
feeding
a
nation
that
perished
with
hunger
i
was
an
equivocal
character
assuming
different
names
and
wandering
over
the
world
with
different
pretences
last
of
all
i
had
revived
in
his
mind
the
images
of
his
father
and
his
mother
all
that
had
once
been
most
dear
and
now
was
most
painful
to
his
recollection
and
had
tortured
his
fancy
with
nameless
horrors
these
sentiments
could
never
be
removed
all
the
explanations
in
the
world
could
never
reconcile
me
to
his
mind
and
i
felt
that
i
had
that
within
which
in
what
was
to
come
as
it
had
in
what
was
past
must
for
ever
annihilate
all
confidence
between
us
at
once
therefore
i
accepted
his
challenge
arranged
with
him
the
terms
of
a
hostile
encounter
on
the
following
morning
and
immediately
after
bid
adieu
to
presburg
and
to
the
sight
of
every
soul
contained
within
its
walls
for
ever
this
is
i
powerfully
feel
the
last
adventure
that
i
shall
ever
have
the
courage
to
commit
to
writing
a
few
minutes
more
and
i
will
lay
down
my
pen
and
resolve
in
the
most
solemn
and
sacred
manner
never
to
compose
another
line
indeed
all
other
adventures
must
necessarily
be
frigid
and
uninteresting
compared
with
that
which
i
have
now
described
great
god
what
a
fate
was
mine
anxious
as
i
had
been
to
prove
myself
in
the
most
momentous
respects
the
benefactor
of
my
son
dismissing
all
other
thoughts
and
cares
from
my
mind
journeying
with
this
sole
object
in
view
from
presburg
to
venice
and
from
venice
to
presburg
from
hungary
to
the
banks
of
the
rhine
and
from
the
banks
of
the
rhine
back
again
to
hungary
the
whole
scene
was
now
terminated
by
a
declaration
on
his
part
that
nothing
could
appease
the
animosity
he
cherished
against
me
short
of
rioting
in
the
blood
of
his
father
s
heart
i
was
reduced
to
the
necessity
either
of
lifting
my
sword
against
my
son
of
running
myself
upon
the
point
of
his
weapon
or
of
forfeiting
the
engagement
between
us
and
suffering
him
to
brand
me
as
a
coward
in
the
face
of
christendom
i
mention
not
this
because
the
variety
of
objects
of
choice
produced
in
me
the
slightest
hesitation
weary
as
i
was
of
life
i
could
cheerfully
have
consented
to
die
but
not
to
stain
the
sword
of
charles
de
damville
with
my
vital
blood
i
prevented
him
from
being
the
assassin
of
his
father
s
life
i
could
not
prevent
him
from
being
the
assassin
of
his
father
s
character
he
was
assiduous
and
indefatigable
in
spreading
against
me
the
blackest
invectives
which
he
regarded
as
the
most
unerring
truths
all
hungary
has
resounded
for
thirty
years
with
the
atrocities
of
the
sieur
de
chatillon
what
is
here
recorded
contains
the
whole
and
unvarnished
truth
on
the
subject
this
narrative
however
shall
never
see
the
light
till
the
melancholy
hour
when
charles
de
damville
shall
be
no
more
yet
in
the
midst
of
the
anguish
the
disappointment
of
every
cherished
hope
which
rends
my
soul
i
have
one
consolation
and
that
an
invaluable
one
in
the
virtues
the
glory
and
the
happiness
of
my
son
i
said
i
would
forget
every
gratification
and
sentiment
of
my
own
in
him
i
am
now
more
than
ever
instigated
to
do
so
when
i
quitted
presburg
i
left
cabriera
behind
me
in
that
city
and
i
took
care
to
obtain
a
parting
interview
with
him
he
afterwards
gave
me
the
meeting
as
we
then
concerted
at
trieste
in
the
duchy
of
carniola
it
happened
as
i
had
flattered
myself
the
event
would
prove
that
the
visible
source
of
umbrage
being
removed
charles
and
pandora
in
no
long
time
came
to
a
mutual
understanding
and
were
finally
made
happy
in
each
other
i
had
been
the
fortunate
means
of
supplying
to
this
excellent
and
incomparable
creature
the
only
defect
under
which
she
laboured
a
want
of
fortune
her
uncle
having
no
longer
a
pretence
to
oppose
their
mutual
passion
united
their
hands
and
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
they
were
regarded
as
the
most
graceful
and
accomplished
couple
in
the
whole
hungarian
dominions
the
chevalier
de
damville
is
considered
in
that
country
as
the
great
bulwark
of
the
christian
frontier
and
the
most
generous
and
illustrious
pupil
in
the
school
of
the
bayards
and
the
scanderbegs
cabriera
worn
out
with
years
and
fatigues
but
still
grasping
and
avaricious
to
his
latest
hour
expired
in
my
arms
in
the
city
of
trieste
and
by
his
death
yielded
me
this
contentment
that
henceforth
the
only
obvious
means
for
detecting
my
beneficent
fraud
in
securing
the
dower
of
pandora
was
for
ever
removed
that
the
reader
may
enter
the
more
fully
into
my
sentiment
of
congratulation
upon
the
happiness
of
my
son
and
rise
from
the
perusal
of
my
narrative
with
a
more
soothing
and
pleasurable
sensation
i
will
here
shortly
recapitulate
the
good
qualities
that
had
been
unfolded
in
this
truly
extraordinary
young
man
from
his
earliest
infancy
he
was
a
child
only
nine
years
of
age
at
the
period
of
the
truly
affecting
and
exemplary
behaviour
the
reader
may
remember
him
to
have
displayed
while
i
was
at
paris
squandering
the
property
of
my
family
at
the
in
the
alienation
of
mind
produced
in
me
by
that
dreadful
catastrophe
he
was
my
constant
attendant
my
careful
nurse
and
my
affectionate
friend
when
twelve
months
after
we
were
driven
by
our
calamities
out
of
switzerland
and
i
lay
extended
to
all
human
appearance
on
the
bed
of
death
charles
was
the
comforter
of
his
mother
the
friend
of
his
sisters
and
even
young
as
he
was
contributed
to
the
maintenance
of
my
starving
family
by
the
labour
of
his
infant
hands
at
dresden
as
yet
no
more
than
seventeen
years
of
age
he
was
assailed
by
one
of
the
severest
trials
with
which
the
mind
of
man
can
in
any
case
be
beset
but
he
hesitated
not
a
moment
obliged
to
choose
between
poverty
and
innocence
with
the
sacrifice
of
all
his
habitudes
and
the
loss
of
every
friend
on
the
one
side
and
wealth
new
to
his
enjoyment
with
ignominy
or
an
equivocal
character
on
the
other
his
determination
was
instant
and
unalterable
cast
at
so
immature
an
age
alone
and
portionless
upon
the
world
he
almost
immediately
by
his
gallantry
his
winning
qualities
and
his
virtues
gained
to
himself
a
friend
in
one
of
the
greatest
captains
of
the
age
unaided
by
the
brilliancy
of
family
or
fortune
he
acquired
the
character
of
the
bravest
soldier
in
hungary
where
all
were
brave
this
last
trial
to
which
i
had
been
the
undesigning
means
of
subjecting
him
was
none
of
the
least
arduous
love
often
entails
imbecility
on
the
noblest
of
mankind
but
charles
surmounted
the
most
perilous
attacks
of
this
passion
when
he
thought
pandora
unworthy
he
tore
himself
from
her
and
would
not
admit
a
struggle
when
he
believed
she
loved
another
he
disdained
to
claim
a
heart
that
seemed
alienated
from
him
and
himself
joined
the
hands
of
his
mistress
and
his
rival
he
might
have
died
he
could
not
disgrace
himself
i
was
the
hero
s
father
but
no
i
am
not
blinded
by
paternal
partiality
but
no
he
was
indeed
what
i
thought
him
as
near
the
climax
of
dignity
and
virtue
as
the
frailty
of
our
nature
will
admit
his
virtue
was
at
length
crowned
with
the
most
enviable
reward
the
earth
has
to
boast
the
faithful
attachment
of
a
and
accomplished
woman
i
am
happy
to
close
my
eventful
and
somewhat
melancholy
story
with
so
pleasing
a
termination
whatever
may
have
been
the
result
of
my
personal
experience
of
human
life
i
can
never
recollect
the
fate
of
charles
and
pandora
without
confessing
with
exultation
that
this
busy
and
anxious
world
of
ours
yet
contains
something
in
its
stores
that
is
worth
living
for
the
end
