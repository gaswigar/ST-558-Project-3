o
ye
who
tread
the
narrow
way
by
to
judgment
day
be
gentle
when
heathen
pray
to
buddha
at
kamakura
buddha
at
kamakura
he
sat
in
defiance
of
municipal
orders
astride
the
gun
zam
zammah
on
her
brick
platform
opposite
the
old
the
wonder
house
as
the
natives
call
the
lahore
museum
who
hold
that
dragon
hold
the
punjab
for
the
great
piece
is
always
first
of
the
conqueror
loot
there
was
some
justification
for
kim
he
had
kicked
lala
dinanath
boy
off
the
trunnions
since
the
english
held
the
punjab
and
kim
was
english
though
he
was
burned
black
as
any
native
though
he
spoke
the
vernacular
by
preference
and
his
in
a
clipped
uncertain
though
he
consorted
on
terms
of
perfect
equality
with
the
small
boys
of
the
bazar
kim
was
white
a
poor
white
of
the
very
poorest
the
woman
who
looked
after
him
she
smoked
opium
and
pretended
to
keep
a
furniture
shop
by
the
square
where
the
cheap
cabs
wait
told
the
missionaries
that
she
was
kim
sister
but
his
mother
had
been
nursemaid
in
a
colonel
family
and
had
married
kimball
a
young
of
the
mavericks
an
irish
regiment
he
afterwards
took
a
post
on
the
sind
punjab
and
delhi
railway
and
his
regiment
went
home
without
him
the
wife
died
of
cholera
in
ferozepore
and
fell
to
drink
and
loafing
up
and
down
the
line
with
the
baby
societies
and
chaplains
anxious
for
the
child
tried
to
catch
him
but
drifted
away
till
he
came
across
the
woman
who
took
opium
and
learned
the
taste
from
her
and
died
as
poor
whites
die
in
india
his
estate
at
death
consisted
of
three
papers
one
he
called
his
because
those
words
were
written
below
his
signature
thereon
and
another
his
the
third
was
those
things
he
was
used
to
say
in
his
glorious
would
yet
make
little
kimball
a
man
on
no
account
was
kim
to
part
with
them
for
they
belonged
to
a
great
piece
of
magic
such
magic
as
men
practised
over
yonder
behind
the
museum
in
the
big
the
magic
house
as
we
name
the
masonic
lodge
it
would
he
said
all
come
right
some
day
and
horn
would
be
exalted
between
pillars
monstrous
pillars
of
beauty
and
strength
the
colonel
himself
riding
on
a
horse
at
the
head
of
the
finest
regiment
in
the
world
would
attend
to
kim
little
kim
that
should
have
been
better
off
than
his
father
nine
hundred
devils
whose
god
was
a
red
bull
on
a
green
field
would
attend
to
kim
if
they
had
not
forgotten
poor
that
was
on
the
ferozepore
line
then
he
would
weep
bitterly
in
the
broken
rush
chair
on
the
veranda
so
it
came
about
after
his
death
that
the
woman
sewed
parchment
paper
and
into
a
leather
which
she
strung
round
kim
neck
some
day
she
said
confusedly
remembering
prophecies
will
come
for
you
a
great
red
bull
on
a
green
field
and
the
colonel
riding
on
his
tall
horse
yes
and
dropping
into
english
hundred
devils
said
kim
shall
remember
a
red
bull
and
a
colonel
on
a
horse
will
come
but
first
my
father
said
will
come
the
two
men
making
ready
the
ground
for
these
matters
that
is
how
my
father
said
they
always
did
and
it
is
always
so
when
men
work
magic
if
the
woman
had
sent
kim
up
to
the
local
with
those
papers
he
would
of
course
have
been
taken
over
by
the
provincial
lodge
and
sent
to
the
masonic
orphanage
in
the
hills
but
what
she
had
heard
of
magic
she
distrusted
kim
too
held
views
of
his
own
as
he
reached
the
years
of
indiscretion
he
learned
to
avoid
missionaries
and
white
men
of
serious
aspect
who
asked
who
he
was
and
what
he
did
for
kim
did
nothing
with
an
immense
success
true
he
knew
the
wonderful
walled
city
of
lahore
from
the
delhi
gate
to
the
outer
fort
ditch
was
hand
in
glove
with
men
who
led
lives
stranger
than
anything
haroun
al
raschid
dreamed
of
and
he
lived
in
a
life
wild
as
that
of
the
arabian
nights
but
missionaries
and
secretaries
of
charitable
societies
could
not
see
the
beauty
of
it
his
nickname
through
the
wards
was
friend
of
all
the
world
and
very
often
being
lithe
and
inconspicuous
he
executed
commissions
by
night
on
the
crowded
housetops
for
sleek
and
shiny
young
men
of
fashion
it
was
intrigue
of
course
he
knew
that
much
as
he
had
known
all
evil
since
he
could
speak
but
what
he
loved
was
the
game
for
its
own
sake
the
stealthy
prowl
through
the
dark
gullies
and
lanes
the
crawl
up
a
waterpipe
the
sights
and
sounds
of
the
women
world
on
the
flat
roofs
and
the
headlong
flight
from
housetop
to
housetop
under
cover
of
the
hot
dark
then
there
were
holy
men
fakirs
by
their
brick
shrines
under
the
trees
at
the
riverside
with
whom
he
was
quite
familiar
greeting
them
as
they
returned
from
and
when
no
one
was
by
eating
from
the
same
dish
the
woman
who
looked
after
him
insisted
with
tears
that
he
should
wear
european
clothes
trousers
a
shirt
and
a
battered
hat
kim
found
it
easier
to
slip
into
hindu
or
mohammedan
garb
when
engaged
on
certain
businesses
one
of
the
young
men
of
fashion
he
who
was
found
dead
at
the
bottom
of
a
well
on
the
night
of
the
earthquake
had
once
given
him
a
complete
suit
of
hindu
kit
the
costume
of
a
lowcaste
street
boy
and
kim
stored
it
in
a
secret
place
under
some
baulks
in
nila
ram
beyond
the
punjab
high
court
where
the
fragrant
deodar
logs
lie
seasoning
after
they
have
driven
down
the
ravi
when
there
was
business
or
frolic
afoot
kim
would
use
his
properties
returning
at
dawn
to
the
veranda
all
tired
out
from
shouting
at
the
heels
of
a
marriage
procession
or
yelling
at
a
hindu
festival
sometimes
there
was
food
in
the
house
more
often
there
was
not
and
then
kim
went
out
again
to
eat
with
his
native
friends
as
he
drummed
his
heels
against
he
turned
now
and
again
from
his
game
with
little
chota
lal
and
abdullah
the
son
to
make
a
rude
remark
to
the
native
policeman
on
guard
over
rows
of
shoes
at
the
museum
door
the
big
punjabi
grinned
tolerantly
he
knew
kim
of
old
so
did
the
sluicing
water
on
the
dry
road
from
his
bag
so
did
jawahir
singh
the
museum
carpenter
bent
over
new
so
did
everybody
in
sight
except
the
peasants
from
the
country
hurrying
up
to
the
wonder
house
to
view
the
things
that
men
made
in
their
own
province
and
elsewhere
the
museum
was
given
up
to
indian
arts
and
manufactures
and
anybody
who
sought
wisdom
could
ask
the
curator
to
explain
off

me

abdullah
climbing
up
wheel

little
chota
lal
in

sterling

a

stopped

there
shuffled
round
the
corner
from
the
roaring
motee
bazar
such
a
man
as
kim
who
thought
he
knew
all
castes
had
never
seen
he
was
nearly
six
feet
high
dressed
in
fold
upon
fold
of
dingy
stuff
like
and
not
one
fold
of
it
could
kim
refer
to
any
known
trade
or
profession
at
his
belt
hung
a
long
iron
pencase
and
a
wooden
rosary
such
as
holy
men
wear
on
his
head
was
a
gigantic
sort
of
his
face
was
yellow
and
wrinkled
like
that
of
fook
shing
the
chinese
bootmaker
in
the
bazar
his
eyes
turned
up
at
the
corners
and
looked
like
little
slits
of
onyx
is
that
said
kim
to
his
companions

is
a
man

abdullah
finger
in
mouth
staring

said
kim
dropping
from
flourishing
his
bare
heels

a
foreigner
and
thou

a
buffalo
the
man
turned
helplessly
and
drifted
towards
the
boys
he
was
old
and
his
woollen
gaberdine
still
reeked
of
the
stinking
artemisia
of
the
mountain
passes
children

that
big
house

said
in
very
fair

his
rosary

half
turned
to
the
museum

kim
asked

by
kulu
from
beyond

he
sighed

water

cool

chinaman
said
abdullah
proudly
fook
shing
had
once
chased
him
out
of
his
shop
for

the
joss
above

boots
a
hillman

chota

hillman
from

tibet
i

a
bhotiya
tibetan
since

lama
or
say
a
guru
in
your
tongue
guru
from
tibet
said
kim

such
a
man

followers
of

middle
way
living
in

in
our
lamasseries
and
i
go
to
see
the
four
holy
places
before
i
die
now

as
much
as
i
do
who

old
he
smiled
benignantly
on
the
boys
thou
eaten
he
fumbled
in
his
bosom
and
drew
forth
a
worn
wooden
the
boys
nodded
all
priests
of
their
acquaintance
begged
do
not
wish
to
eat
yet
he
turned
his
head
like
an
old
tortoise
in
the
sunlight
it
true
that
there
are
many
images
in
the
wonder
house
of
lahore
he
repeated
the
last
words
as
one
making
sure
of
an
address
is
true
said
abdullah
is
full
of
heathen
busts
thou
also
art
an
idolater
mind
him
said
kim

the
government
house
and
there
is
no
idolatry
in
it
but
only
a
sahib
with
a
white
beard
come
with
me
and
i
will
show
priests

boys
whispered
chota
lal
he
is
a
stranger
and

idolater
said
abdullah
the
mohammedan
kim
laughed
is
new
run
to
your
mothers
laps
and
be
safe
come
kim
clicked
round
the
turnstile
the
old
man
followed
and
halted
amazed
in
the
stood
the
larger
figures
of
the
sculptures
done
savants
know
how
long
since
by
forgotten
workmen
whose
hands
were
feeling
and
not
unskilfully
for
the
mysteriously
transmitted
grecian
touch
there
were
hundreds
of
pieces
friezes
of
figures
in
relief
fragments
of
statues
and
slabs
crowded
with
figures
that
had
encrusted
the
brick
walls
of
the
buddhist
stupas
and
viharas
of
the
north
country
and
now
dug
up
and
labelled
made
the
pride
of
the
museum
in
wonder
the
lama
turned
to
this
and
that
and
finally
checked
in
rapt
attention
before
a
large
representing
a
coronation
or
apotheosis
of
the
lord
buddha
the
master
was
represented
seated
on
a
lotus
the
petals
of
which
were
so
deeply
undercut
as
to
show
almost
detached
round
him
was
an
adoring
hierarchy
of
kings
elders
and
buddhas
below
were
waters
with
fishes
and
two
devas
held
a
wreath
over
his
head
above
them
another
pair
supported
an
umbrella
surmounted
by
the
jewelled
headdress
of
the
bodhisat
lord
the
lord
it
is
sakya
muni
himself
the
lama
half
sobbed
and
under
his
breath
began
the
wonderful
buddhist
invocation
to
him
the
way
the
law
apart
whom
maya
held
beneath
her
heart
ananda
lord
the
bodhisat
he
is
here
the
most
excellent
law
is
here
also
my
pilgrimage
is
well
begun
and
what
work
what
work
is
the
sahib
said
kim
and
dodged
sideways
among
the
cases
of
the
arts
and
manufacturers
wing
a
englishman
was
looking
at
the
lama
who
gravely
turned
and
saluted
him
and
after
some
fumbling
drew
forth
a
and
a
scrap
of
paper
that
is
my
name
smiling
at
the
clumsy
childish
print
of
us
who
had
made
pilgrimage
to
the
holy
places
he
is
now
abbot
of
the
monastery
gave
it
me
stammered
the
lama
spoke
of
these
his
lean
hand
moved
tremulously
round
then
o
lama
from
tibet
here
be
the
images
and
i
am
here
he
glanced
at
the
lama
face
gather
knowledge
come
to
my
office
awhile
the
old
man
was
trembling
with
excitement
the
office
was
but
a
little
wooden
cubicle
partitioned
off
from
the
gallery
kim
laid
himself
down
his
ear
against
a
crack
in
the
cedar
door
and
following
his
instinct
stretched
out
to
listen
and
watch
most
of
the
talk
was
altogether
above
his
head
the
lama
haltingly
at
first
spoke
to
the
curator
of
his
own
lamassery
the
opposite
the
painted
rocks
four
months
march
away
the
curator
brought
out
a
huge
book
of
photos
and
showed
him
that
very
place
perched
on
its
crag
overlooking
the
gigantic
valley
of
strata
ay
the
lama
mounted
a
pair
of
spectacles
of
chinese
work
is
the
little
door
through
which
we
bring
wood
before
winter
and
thou
the
english
know
of
these
things
he
who
is
now
abbot
of
told
me
but
i
did
not
believe
the
lord
the
excellent
one
he
has
honour
here
too
and
his
life
is
known
is
all
carven
upon
the
stones
come
and
see
if
thou
art
rested
out
shuffled
the
lama
to
the
main
hall
and
the
curator
beside
him
went
through
the
collection
with
the
reverence
of
a
devotee
and
the
appreciative
instinct
of
a
craftsman
incident
by
incident
in
the
beautiful
story
he
identified
on
the
blurred
stone
puzzled
here
and
there
by
the
unfamiliar
greek
convention
but
delighted
as
a
child
at
each
new
trove
where
the
sequence
failed
as
in
the
annunciation
the
curator
supplied
it
from
his
mound
of
books
french
and
german
with
photographs
and
reproductions
here
was
the
devout
asita
the
pendant
of
simeon
in
the
christian
story
holding
the
holy
child
on
his
knee
while
mother
and
father
listened
and
here
were
incidents
in
the
legend
of
the
cousin
devadatta
here
was
the
wicked
woman
who
accused
the
master
of
impurity
all
confounded
here
was
the
teaching
in
the
the
miracle
that
stunned
the
here
was
the
bodhisat
in
royal
state
as
a
prince
the
miraculous
birth
the
death
at
kusinagara
where
the
weak
disciple
fainted
while
there
were
almost
countless
repetitions
of
the
meditation
under
the
bodhi
tree
and
the
adoration
of
the
was
everywhere
in
a
few
minutes
the
curator
saw
that
his
guest
was
no
mere
mendicant
but
a
scholar
of
parts
and
they
went
at
it
all
over
again
the
lama
taking
snuff
wiping
his
spectacles
and
talking
at
railway
speed
in
a
bewildering
mixture
of
urdu
and
tibetan
he
had
heard
of
the
travels
of
the
chinese
pilgrims
and
and
was
anxious
to
know
if
there
was
any
translation
of
their
record
he
drew
in
his
breath
as
he
turned
helplessly
over
the
pages
of
beal
and
stanislas
julien
all
here
a
treasure
locked
then
he
composed
himself
reverently
to
listen
to
fragments
hastily
rendered
into
urdu
for
the
first
time
he
heard
of
the
labours
of
european
scholars
who
by
the
help
of
these
and
a
hundred
other
documents
have
identified
the
holy
places
of
buddhism
then
he
was
shown
a
mighty
map
spotted
and
traced
with
yellow
the
brown
finger
followed
the
curator
pencil
from
point
to
point
here
was
kapilavastu
here
the
middle
kingdom
and
here
mahabodhi
the
mecca
of
buddhism
and
here
was
kusinagara
sad
place
of
the
holy
death
the
old
man
bowed
his
head
over
the
sheets
in
silence
for
a
while
and
the
curator
lit
another
pipe
kim
had
fallen
asleep
when
he
waked
the
talk
still
in
spate
was
more
within
his
comprehension
thus
it
was
o
fountain
of
wisdom
that
i
decided
to
go
to
the
holy
places
which
his
foot
had
trod
to
the
birthplace
even
to
kapila
then
to
mahabodhi
which
is
buddh
gaya
to
the
monastery
to
the
to
the
place
of
his
death
the
lama
lowered
his
voice
i
come
here
alone
for
five
seven
eighteen
forty
years
it
was
in
my
mind
that
the
old
law
was
not
well
followed
being
overlaid
as
thou
knowest
with
devildom
charms
and
idolatry
even
as
the
child
outside
said
but
now
ay
even
as
the
child
said
with
it
comes
with
all
faiths
thou
the
books
of
my
lamassery
i
read
and
they
were
dried
pith
and
the
later
ritual
with
which
we
of
the
reformed
law
have
cumbered
ourselves
that
too
had
no
worth
to
these
old
eyes
even
the
followers
of
the
excellent
one
are
at
feud
on
feud
with
one
another
it
is
all
illusion
ay
maya
illusion
but
i
have
another
desire
the
seamed
yellow
face
drew
within
three
inches
of
the
curator
and
the
long
tapped
on
the
table
scholars
by
these
books
have
followed
the
blessed
feet
in
all
their
wanderings
but
there
are
things
which
they
have
not
sought
out
i
know
nothing
nothing
do
i
know
but
i
go
to
free
myself
from
the
wheel
of
things
by
a
broad
and
open
road
he
smiled
with
most
simple
triumph
a
pilgrim
to
the
holy
places
i
acquire
merit
but
there
is
more
listen
to
a
true
thing
when
our
gracious
lord
being
as
yet
a
youth
sought
a
mate
men
said
in
his
father
court
that
he
was
too
tender
for
marriage
thou
knowest
the
curator
nodded
wondering
what
would
come
next
they
made
the
triple
trial
of
strength
against
all
comers
and
at
the
test
of
the
bow
our
lord
first
breaking
that
which
they
gave
him
called
for
such
a
bow
as
none
might
bend
thou
knowest
is
written
i
have
read
overshooting
all
other
marks
the
arrow
passed
far
and
far
beyond
sight
at
the
last
it
fell
and
where
it
touched
earth
there
broke
out
a
stream
which
presently
became
a
river
whose
nature
by
our
lord
beneficence
and
that
merit
he
acquired
ere
he
freed
himself
is
that
whoso
bathes
in
it
washes
away
all
taint
and
speckle
of
sin
it
is
written
said
the
curator
sadly
the
lama
drew
a
long
breath
is
that
river
fountain
of
wisdom
where
fell
the
arrow
my
brother
i
do
not
know
said
the
curator
if
it
please
thee
to
forget
the
one
thing
only
that
thou
hast
not
told
me
surely
thou
must
know
see
i
am
an
old
man
i
ask
with
my
head
between
thy
feet
o
fountain
of
wisdom
we
know
he
drew
the
bow
we
know
the
arrow
fell
we
know
the
stream
gushed
where
then
is
the
river
my
dream
told
me
to
find
it
so
i
came
i
am
here
but
where
is
the
river
i
knew
think
you
i
would
not
cry
it
aloud
it
one
attains
freedom
from
the
wheel
of
things
the
lama
went
on
unheeding
river
of
the
arrow
think
again
some
little
stream
maybe
dried
in
the
heats
but
the
holy
one
would
never
so
cheat
an
old
man
do
not
know
i
do
not
know
the
lama
brought
his
face
once
more
a
handsbreadth
from
the
englishman
see
thou
dost
not
know
not
being
of
the
law
the
matter
is
hid
from
thee
hidden
hidden
are
both
bound
thou
and
i
my
brother
but
i
he
rose
with
a
sweep
of
the
soft
thick
drapery
go
to
cut
myself
free
come
also
am
bound
said
the
curator
whither
goest
thou
to
kashi
benares
where
else
there
i
shall
meet
one
of
the
pure
faith
in
a
jain
temple
of
that
city
he
also
is
a
seeker
in
secret
and
from
him
haply
i
may
learn
maybe
he
will
go
with
me
to
buddh
gaya
thence
north
and
west
to
kapilavastu
and
there
will
i
seek
for
the
river
nay
i
will
seek
everywhere
as
i
go
for
the
place
is
not
known
where
the
arrow
fell
how
wilt
thou
go
it
is
a
far
cry
to
delhi
and
farther
to
benares
road
and
the
trains
from
pathankot
having
left
the
hills
i
came
hither
in
a
it
goes
swiftly
at
first
i
was
amazed
to
see
those
tall
poles
by
the
side
of
the
road
snatching
up
and
snatching
up
their
threads
he
illustrated
the
stoop
and
whirl
of
a
flashing
past
the
train
later
i
was
cramped
and
desired
to
walk
as
i
am
used
thou
art
sure
of
thy
road
said
the
curator
for
that
one
but
asks
a
question
and
pays
money
and
the
appointed
persons
despatch
all
to
the
appointed
place
that
much
i
knew
in
my
lamassery
from
sure
report
said
the
lama
proudly
when
dost
thou
go
the
curator
smiled
at
the
mixture
of
piety
and
modern
progress
that
is
the
note
of
india
today
soon
as
may
be
i
follow
the
places
of
his
life
till
i
come
to
the
river
of
the
arrow
there
is
moreover
a
written
paper
of
the
hours
of
the
trains
that
go
south
for
food
lamas
as
a
rule
have
good
store
of
money
somewhere
about
them
but
the
curator
wished
to
make
sure
the
journey
i
take
up
the
master
yes
even
as
he
went
so
go
i
forsaking
the
ease
of
my
monastery
there
was
with
me
when
i
left
the
hills
a
chela
disciple
who
begged
for
me
as
the
rule
demands
but
halting
in
kulu
awhile
a
fever
took
him
and
he
died
i
have
now
no
chela
but
i
will
take
the
and
thus
enable
the
charitable
to
acquire
merit
he
nodded
his
head
valiantly
learned
doctors
of
a
lamassery
do
not
beg
but
the
lama
was
an
enthusiast
in
this
quest
it
so
said
the
curator
smiling
me
now
to
acquire
merit
we
be
craftsmen
together
thou
and
i
here
is
a
new
book
of
white
english
paper
here
be
sharpened
pencils
two
and
three
thick
and
thin
all
good
for
a
scribe
now
lend
me
thy
spectacles
the
curator
looked
through
them
they
were
heavily
scratched
but
the
power
was
almost
exactly
that
of
his
own
pair
which
he
slid
into
the
lama
hand
saying
these
feather
a
very
feather
upon
the
face
the
old
man
turned
his
head
delightedly
and
wrinkled
up
his
nose
scarcely
do
i
feel
them
how
clearly
do
i
see
be
bilaur
crystal
and
will
never
scratch
may
they
help
thee
to
thy
river
for
they
are
thine
will
take
them
and
the
pencils
and
the
white
said
the
lama
a
sign
of
friendship
between
priest
and
priest
and
now
he
fumbled
at
his
belt
detached
the
iron
pincers
and
laid
it
on
the
curator
table
is
for
a
memory
between
thee
and
me
my
pencase
it
is
something
old
even
as
i
am
it
was
a
piece
of
ancient
design
chinese
of
an
iron
that
is
not
smelted
these
days
and
the
collector
heart
in
the
curator
bosom
had
gone
out
to
it
from
the
first
for
no
persuasion
would
the
lama
resume
his
gift
i
return
having
found
the
river
i
will
bring
thee
a
written
picture
of
the
padma
samthora
such
as
i
used
to
make
on
silk
at
the
lamassery
yes
and
of
the
wheel
of
life
he
chuckled
we
be
craftsmen
together
thou
and
i
the
curator
would
have
detained
him
they
are
few
in
the
world
who
still
have
the
secret
of
the
conventional
buddhist
pictures
which
are
as
it
were
half
written
and
half
drawn
but
the
lama
strode
out
head
high
in
air
and
pausing
an
instant
before
the
great
statue
of
a
bodhisat
in
meditation
brushed
through
the
turnstiles
kim
followed
like
a
shadow
what
he
had
overheard
excited
him
wildly
this
man
was
entirely
new
to
all
his
experience
and
he
meant
to
investigate
further
precisely
as
he
would
have
investigated
a
new
building
or
a
strange
festival
in
lahore
city
the
lama
was
his
trove
and
he
purposed
to
take
possession
kim
mother
had
been
irish
too
the
old
man
halted
by
and
looked
round
till
his
eye
fell
on
kim
the
inspiration
of
his
pilgrimage
had
left
him
for
awhile
and
he
felt
old
forlorn
and
very
empty
not
sit
under
that
gun
said
the
policeman
loftily
owl
was
kim
retort
on
the
lama
behalf
under
that
gun
if
it
please
thee
when
didst
thou
steal
the
milkwoman
slippers
dunnoo
that
was
an
utterly
unfounded
charge
sprung
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
but
it
silenced
dunnoo
who
knew
that
kim
clear
yell
could
call
up
legions
of
bad
bazaar
boys
if
need
arose
whom
didst
thou
worship
within
said
kim
affably
squatting
in
the
shade
beside
the
lama
worshipped
none
child
i
bowed
before
the
excellent
law
kim
accepted
this
new
god
without
emotion
he
knew
already
a
few
score
what
dost
thou
do
beg
i
remember
now
it
is
long
since
i
have
eaten
or
drunk
what
is
the
custom
of
charity
in
this
town
in
silence
as
we
do
of
tibet
or
speaking
aloud
who
beg
in
silence
starve
in
silence
said
kim
quoting
a
native
proverb
the
lama
tried
to
rise
but
sank
back
again
sighing
for
his
disciple
dead
in
kulu
kim
watched
head
to
one
side
considering
and
interested
me
the
bowl
i
know
the
people
of
this
city
all
who
are
charitable
give
and
i
will
bring
it
back
filled
simply
as
a
child
the
old
man
handed
him
the
bowl
thou
i
know
the
people
he
trotted
off
to
the
open
shop
of
a
kunjri
a
which
lay
opposite
the
line
down
the
motee
bazar
she
knew
kim
of
old
hast
thou
turned
yogi
with
thy
she
cried
said
kim
proudly
is
a
new
priest
in
the
city
a
man
such
as
i
have
never
seen
priest
young
tiger
said
the
woman
angrily
am
tired
of
new
priests
they
settle
on
our
wares
like
flies
is
the
father
of
my
son
a
well
of
charity
to
give
to
all
who
ask
said
kim
man
is
rather
yagi
than
yogi
a
holy
man
but
this
priest
is
new
the
sahib
in
the
wonder
house
has
talked
to
him
like
a
brother
o
my
mother
fill
me
this
bowl
he
waits
bowl
indeed
that
basket
thou
hast
as
much
grace
as
the
holy
bull
of
shiv
he
has
taken
the
best
of
a
basket
of
onions
already
this
morn
and
forsooth
i
must
fill
thy
bowl
he
comes
here
again
the
huge
brahmini
bull
of
the
ward
was
shouldering
his
way
through
the
crowd
a
stolen
plantain
hanging
out
of
his
mouth
he
headed
straight
for
the
shop
well
knowing
his
privileges
as
a
sacred
beast
lowered
his
head
and
puffed
heavily
along
the
line
of
baskets
ere
making
his
choice
up
flew
kim
hard
little
heel
and
caught
him
on
his
moist
blue
nose
he
snorted
indignantly
and
walked
away
across
the
his
hump
quivering
with
rage
i
have
saved
more
than
the
bowl
will
cost
thrice
over
now
mother
a
little
rice
and
some
dried
fish
atop
yes
and
some
vegetable
curry
a
growl
came
out
of
the
back
of
the
shop
where
a
man
lay
drove
away
the
bull
said
the
woman
in
an
undertone
is
good
to
give
to
the
poor
she
took
the
bowl
and
returned
it
full
of
hot
rice
my
yogi
is
not
a
cow
said
kim
gravely
making
a
hole
with
his
fingers
in
the
top
of
the
mound
little
curry
is
good
and
a
fried
cake
and
a
morsel
of
conserve
would
please
him
i
think
is
a
hole
as
big
as
thy
head
said
the
woman
fretfully
but
she
filled
it
none
the
less
with
good
steaming
vegetable
curry
clapped
a
fried
cake
atop
and
a
morsel
of
clarified
butter
on
the
cake
dabbed
a
lump
of
sour
tamarind
conserve
at
the
side
and
kim
looked
at
the
load
lovingly
is
good
when
i
am
in
the
bazar
the
bull
shall
not
come
to
this
house
he
is
a
bold
thou
laughed
the
woman
speak
well
of
bulls
hast
thou
not
told
me
that
some
day
a
red
bull
will
come
out
of
a
field
to
help
thee
now
hold
all
straight
and
ask
for
the
holy
man
blessing
upon
me
perhaps
too
he
knows
a
cure
for
my
daughter
sore
eyes
ask
him
that
also
o
thou
little
friend
of
all
the
world
but
kim
had
danced
off
ere
the
end
of
the
sentence
dodging
pariah
dogs
and
hungry
acquaintances
do
we
beg
who
know
the
way
of
it
said
he
proudly
to
the
lama
who
opened
his
eyes
at
the
contents
of
the
bowl
now
and
i
will
eat
with
thee
ohe
bhisti
he
called
to
the
sluicing
the
crotons
by
the
museum
water
here
we
men
are
thirsty
men
said
the
bhisti
laughing
one
skinful
enough
for
such
a
pair
drink
then
in
the
name
of
the
compassionate
he
loosed
a
thin
stream
into
kim
hands
who
drank
native
fashion
but
the
lama
must
needs
pull
out
a
cup
from
his
inexhaustible
upper
draperies
and
drink
ceremonially
a
foreigner
kim
explained
as
the
old
man
delivered
in
an
unknown
tongue
what
was
evidently
a
blessing
they
ate
together
in
great
content
clearing
the
beggingbowl
then
the
lama
took
snuff
from
a
portentous
wooden
fingered
his
rosary
awhile
and
so
dropped
into
the
easy
sleep
of
age
as
the
shadow
of
grew
long
kim
loafed
over
to
the
nearest
a
rather
lively
young
mohammedan
woman
and
begged
a
rank
cigar
of
the
brand
that
they
sell
to
students
of
the
punjab
university
who
copy
english
customs
then
he
smoked
and
thought
knees
to
chin
under
the
belly
of
the
gun
and
the
outcome
of
his
thoughts
was
a
sudden
and
stealthy
departure
in
the
direction
of
nila
ram
the
lama
did
not
wake
till
the
evening
life
of
the
city
had
begun
with
and
the
return
of
clerks
and
subordinates
from
the
government
offices
he
stared
dizzily
in
all
directions
but
none
looked
at
him
save
a
hindu
urchin
in
a
dirty
turban
and
clothes
suddenly
he
bowed
his
head
on
his
knees
and
wailed
is
this
said
the
boy
standing
before
him
thou
been
robbed
is
my
new
chela
disciple
that
is
gone
away
from
me
and
i
know
not
where
he
is
what
like
of
man
was
thy
disciple
was
a
boy
who
came
to
me
in
place
of
him
who
died
on
account
of
the
merit
which
i
had
gained
when
i
bowed
before
the
law
within
there
he
pointed
towards
the
museum
came
upon
me
to
show
me
a
road
which
i
had
lost
he
led
me
into
the
wonder
house
and
by
his
talk
emboldened
me
to
speak
to
the
keeper
of
the
images
so
that
i
was
cheered
and
made
strong
and
when
i
was
faint
with
hunger
he
begged
for
me
as
would
a
chela
for
his
teacher
suddenly
was
he
sent
suddenly
has
he
gone
away
it
was
in
my
mind
to
have
taught
him
the
law
upon
the
road
to
benares
kim
stood
amazed
at
this
because
he
had
overheard
the
talk
in
the
museum
and
knew
that
the
old
man
was
speaking
the
truth
which
is
a
thing
a
native
on
the
road
seldom
presents
to
a
stranger
i
see
now
that
he
was
but
sent
for
a
purpose
by
this
i
know
that
i
shall
find
a
certain
river
for
which
i
seek
river
of
the
arrow
said
kim
with
a
superior
smile
this
yet
another
sending
cried
the
lama
none
have
i
spoken
of
my
search
save
to
the
priest
of
the
images
who
art
thou
chela
said
kim
simply
sitting
on
his
heels
have
never
seen
anyone
like
to
thee
in
all
this
my
life
i
go
with
thee
to
benares
and
too
i
think
that
so
old
a
man
as
thou
speaking
the
truth
to
people
at
dusk
is
in
great
need
of
a
disciple
the
river
the
river
of
the
arrow
that
i
heard
when
thou
wast
speaking
to
the
englishman
i
lay
against
the
door
the
lama
sighed
thought
thou
hadst
been
a
guide
permitted
such
things
fall
sometimes
but
i
am
not
worthy
thou
dost
not
then
know
the
river
i
kim
laughed
uneasily
go
to
look
for
for
a
bull
a
red
bull
on
a
green
field
who
shall
help
me
boylike
if
an
acquaintance
had
a
scheme
kim
was
quite
ready
with
one
of
his
own
and
boylike
he
had
really
thought
for
as
much
as
twenty
minutes
at
a
time
of
his
father
prophecy
what
child
said
the
lama
knows
but
so
my
father
told
me
i
heard
thy
talk
in
the
wonder
house
of
all
those
new
strange
places
in
the
hills
and
if
one
so
old
and
so
little
so
used
to
may
go
out
for
the
small
matter
of
a
river
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
too
must
go
if
it
is
our
fate
to
find
those
things
we
shall
find
them
thou
thy
river
and
i
my
bull
and
the
strong
pillars
and
some
other
matters
that
i
forget
is
not
pillars
but
a
wheel
from
which
i
would
be
free
said
the
lama
is
all
one
perhaps
they
will
make
me
a
king
said
kim
serenely
prepared
for
anything
will
teach
thee
other
and
better
desires
upon
the
road
the
lama
replied
in
the
voice
of
authority
us
go
to
benares
by
night
thieves
are
abroad
wait
till
the
day
there
is
no
place
to
sleep
the
old
man
was
used
to
the
order
of
his
monastery
and
though
he
slept
on
the
ground
as
the
rule
decrees
preferred
a
decency
in
these
things
shall
get
good
lodging
at
the
kashmir
serai
said
kim
laughing
at
his
perplexity
have
a
friend
there
come
the
hot
and
crowded
bazars
blazed
with
light
as
they
made
their
way
through
the
press
of
all
the
races
in
upper
india
and
the
lama
mooned
through
it
like
a
man
in
a
dream
it
was
his
first
experience
of
a
large
manufacturing
city
and
the
crowded
with
its
continually
squealing
brakes
frightened
him
half
pushed
half
towed
he
arrived
at
the
high
gate
of
the
kashmir
serai
that
huge
open
square
over
against
the
railway
station
surrounded
with
arched
cloisters
where
the
camel
and
horse
caravans
put
up
on
their
return
from
central
asia
here
were
all
manner
of
northern
folk
tending
tethered
ponies
and
kneeling
camels
loading
and
unloading
bales
and
bundles
drawing
water
for
the
evening
meal
at
the
creaking
piling
grass
before
the
shrieking
stallions
cuffing
the
surly
caravan
dogs
paying
off
taking
on
new
grooms
swearing
shouting
arguing
and
chaffering
in
the
packed
square
the
cloisters
reached
by
three
or
four
masonry
steps
made
a
haven
of
refuge
around
this
turbulent
sea
most
of
them
were
rented
to
traders
as
we
rent
the
arches
of
a
viaduct
the
space
between
pillar
and
pillar
being
bricked
or
boarded
off
into
rooms
which
were
guarded
by
heavy
wooden
doors
and
cumbrous
native
padlocks
locked
doors
showed
that
the
owner
was
away
and
a
few
rude
sometimes
very
rude
chalk
or
paint
scratches
told
where
he
had
gone
thus
ullah
is
gone
to
kurdistan
below
in
coarse
verse
allah
who
sufferest
lice
to
live
on
the
coat
of
a
kabuli
why
hast
thou
allowed
this
louse
lutuf
to
live
so
long
kim
fending
the
lama
between
excited
men
and
excited
beasts
sidled
along
the
cloisters
to
the
far
end
nearest
therailway
station
where
mahbub
ali
the
lived
when
he
came
in
from
that
mysterious
land
beyond
the
passes
of
the
north
kim
had
had
many
dealings
with
mahbub
in
his
little
life
especially
between
his
tenth
and
his
thirteenth
year
and
the
big
burly
afghan
his
beard
dyed
scarlet
with
lime
for
he
was
elderly
and
did
not
wish
his
grey
hairs
to
show
knew
the
boy
value
as
a
gossip
sometimes
he
would
tell
kim
to
watch
a
man
who
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
horses
to
follow
him
for
one
whole
day
and
report
every
soul
with
whom
he
talked
kim
would
deliver
himself
of
his
tale
at
evening
and
mahbub
would
listen
without
a
word
or
gesture
it
was
intrigue
of
some
kind
kim
knew
but
its
worth
lay
in
saying
nothing
whatever
to
anyone
except
mahbub
who
gave
him
beautiful
meals
all
hot
from
the
cookshop
at
the
head
of
the
serai
and
once
as
much
as
eight
annas
in
money
is
here
said
kim
hitting
a
camel
on
the
nose
mahbub
ali
he
halted
at
a
dark
arch
and
slipped
behind
the
bewildered
lama
the
his
deep
embroidered
bokhariot
belt
unloosed
was
lying
on
a
pair
of
silk
carpet
pulling
lazily
at
an
immense
silver
hookah
he
turned
his
head
very
slightly
at
the
cry
and
seeing
only
the
tall
silent
figure
chuckled
in
his
deep
chest
a
lama
a
red
lama
it
is
far
from
lahore
to
the
passes
what
dost
thou
do
here
the
lama
held
out
the
mechanically
curse
on
all
unbelievers
said
mahbub
do
not
give
to
a
lousy
tibetan
but
ask
my
baltis
over
yonder
behind
the
camels
they
may
value
your
blessings
oh
horseboys
here
is
a
countryman
of
yours
see
if
he
be
hungry
a
shaven
crouching
balti
who
had
come
down
with
the
horses
and
who
was
nominally
some
sort
of
degraded
buddhist
fawned
upon
the
priest
and
in
thick
gutturals
besought
the
holy
one
to
sit
at
the
fire
said
kim
pushing
him
lightly
and
the
lama
strode
away
leaving
kim
at
the
edge
of
the
cloister
said
mahbub
ali
returning
to
his
hookah
hindu
run
away
god
curse
on
all
unbelievers
beg
from
those
of
my
tail
who
are
of
thy
faith
whined
kim
using
the
hindu
form
of
address
and
thoroughly
enjoying
the
situation
father
is
dead
my
mother
is
dead
my
stomach
is
empty
from
my
men
among
the
horses
i
say
there
must
be
some
hindus
in
my
tail
mahbub
ali
but
am
i
a
hindu
said
kim
in
english
the
trader
gave
no
sign
of
astonishment
but
looked
under
shaggy
eyebrows
friend
of
all
the
world
said
he
is
this
i
am
now
that
holy
man
disciple
and
we
go
a
pilgrimage
together
to
benares
he
says
he
is
quite
mad
and
i
am
tired
of
lahore
city
i
wish
new
air
and
water
for
whom
dost
thou
work
why
come
to
me
the
voice
was
harsh
with
suspicion
whom
else
should
i
come
i
have
no
money
it
is
not
good
to
go
about
without
money
thou
wilt
sell
many
horses
to
the
officers
they
are
very
fine
horses
these
new
ones
i
have
seen
them
give
me
a
rupee
mahbub
ali
and
when
i
come
to
my
wealth
i
will
give
thee
a
bond
and
pay
said
mahbub
ali
thinking
swiftly
hast
never
before
lied
to
me
call
that
lama
stand
back
in
the
dark
our
tales
will
agree
said
kim
laughing
go
to
benares
said
the
lama
as
soon
as
he
understood
the
drift
of
mahbub
ali
questions
boy
and
i
i
go
to
seek
for
a
certain
river
but
the
boy
is
my
disciple
he
was
sent
i
think
to
guide
me
to
that
river
sitting
under
a
gun
was
i
when
he
came
suddenly
such
things
have
befallen
the
fortunate
to
whom
guidance
was
allowed
but
i
remember
now
he
said
he
was
of
this
world
a
hindu
his
name
i
did
not
ask
is
he
not
my
disciple
country
his
race
his
village
mussalman
sikh
hindu
jain
low
caste
or
high
should
i
ask
there
is
neither
high
nor
low
in
the
middle
way
if
he
is
my
chela
does
will
can
anyone
take
him
from
me
for
look
you
without
him
i
shall
not
find
my
river
he
wagged
his
head
solemnly
shall
take
him
from
thee
go
sit
among
my
baltis
said
mahbub
ali
and
the
lama
drifted
off
soothed
by
the
promise
he
not
quite
mad
said
kim
coming
forward
to
the
light
again
should
i
lie
to
thee
hajji
mahbub
puffed
his
hookah
in
silence
then
he
began
almost
whispering
is
on
the
road
to
benares
if
indeed
ye
two
go
there
tck
i
tell
thee
he
does
not
know
how
to
lie
as
we
two
know
if
thou
wilt
carry
a
message
for
me
as
far
as
umballa
i
will
give
thee
money
it
concerns
a
horse
a
white
stallion
which
i
have
sold
to
an
officer
upon
the
last
time
i
returned
from
the
passes
but
then
stand
nearer
and
hold
up
hands
as
begging
the
pedigree
of
the
white
stallion
was
not
fully
established
and
that
officer
who
is
now
at
umballa
bade
me
make
it
clear
mahbub
here
described
the
horse
and
the
appearance
of
the
officer
the
message
to
that
officer
will
be
the
pedigree
of
the
white
stallion
is
fully
established
by
this
will
he
know
that
thou
comest
from
me
he
will
then
say
what
proof
hast
thou
and
thou
wilt
answer
mahbub
ali
has
given
me
the
proof
all
for
the
sake
of
a
white
stallion
said
kim
with
a
giggle
his
eyes
aflame
pedigree
i
will
give
thee
now
in
my
own
fashion
and
some
hard
words
as
well
a
shadow
passed
behind
kim
and
a
feeding
camel
mahbub
ali
raised
his
voice
art
thou
the
only
beggar
in
the
city
thy
mother
is
dead
thy
father
is
dead
so
is
it
with
all
of
them
well
well
he
turned
as
feeling
on
the
floor
beside
him
and
tossed
a
flap
of
soft
greasy
mussalman
bread
to
the
boy
and
lie
down
among
my
horseboys
for
tonight
thou
and
the
lama
tomorrow
i
may
give
thee
service
kim
slunk
away
his
teeth
in
the
bread
and
as
he
expected
he
found
a
small
wad
of
folded
wrapped
in
oilskin
with
three
silver
rupees
enormous
largesse
he
smiled
and
thrust
money
and
paper
into
his
leather
the
lama
sumptuously
fed
by
mahbub
baltis
was
already
asleep
in
a
corner
of
one
of
the
stalls
kim
lay
down
beside
him
and
laughed
he
knew
he
had
rendered
a
service
to
mahbub
ali
and
not
for
one
little
minute
did
he
believe
the
tale
of
the
stallion
pedigree
but
kim
did
not
suspect
that
mahbub
ali
known
as
one
of
the
best
in
the
punjab
a
wealthy
and
enterprising
trader
whose
caravans
penetrated
far
and
far
into
the
back
of
beyond
was
registered
in
one
of
the
locked
books
of
the
indian
survey
department
as
ib
twice
or
thrice
yearly
would
send
in
a
little
story
baldly
told
but
most
interesting
and
generally
it
was
checked
by
the
statements
of
and
quite
true
it
concerned
all
manner
of
mountain
principalities
explorers
of
nationalities
other
than
english
and
the
guntrade
was
in
brief
a
small
portion
of
that
vast
mass
of
received
on
which
the
indian
government
acts
but
recently
five
confederated
kings
who
had
no
business
to
confederate
had
been
informed
by
a
kindly
northern
power
that
there
was
a
leakage
of
news
from
their
territories
into
british
india
so
those
prime
ministers
were
seriously
annoyed
and
took
steps
after
the
oriental
fashion
they
suspected
among
many
others
the
bullying
horsedealer
whose
caravans
ploughed
through
their
fastnesses
in
snow
at
least
his
caravan
that
season
had
been
ambushed
and
shot
at
twice
on
the
way
down
when
mahbub
men
accounted
for
three
strange
ruffians
who
might
or
might
not
have
been
hired
for
the
job
therefore
mahbub
had
avoided
halting
at
the
insalubrious
city
of
peshawur
and
had
come
through
without
stop
to
lahore
where
knowing
his
he
anticipated
curious
developments
and
there
was
that
on
mahbub
ali
which
he
did
not
wish
to
keep
an
hour
longer
than
was
necessary
a
wad
of
closely
folded
wrapped
in
oilskin
an
impersonal
unaddressed
statement
with
five
microscopic
in
one
corner
that
most
scandalously
betrayed
the
five
confederated
kings
the
sympathetic
northern
power
a
hindu
banker
in
peshawur
a
firm
of
in
belgium
and
an
important
mohammedan
ruler
to
the
south
this
last
was
work
which
mahbub
had
picked
up
beyond
the
dora
pass
and
was
carrying
in
for
who
owing
to
circumstances
over
which
he
had
no
control
could
not
leave
his
post
of
observation
dynamite
was
milky
and
innocuous
beside
that
report
of
and
even
an
oriental
with
an
oriental
views
of
the
value
of
time
could
see
that
the
sooner
it
was
in
the
proper
hands
the
better
mahbub
had
no
particular
desire
to
die
by
violence
because
two
or
three
family
across
the
border
hung
unfinished
on
his
hands
and
when
these
scores
were
cleared
he
intended
to
settle
down
as
a
more
or
less
virtuous
citizen
he
had
never
passed
the
serai
gate
since
his
arrival
two
days
ago
but
had
been
ostentatious
in
sending
telegrams
to
bombay
where
he
banked
some
of
his
money
to
delhi
where
a
of
his
own
clan
was
selling
horses
to
the
agent
of
a
rajputana
state
and
to
umballa
where
an
englishman
was
excitedly
demanding
the
pedigree
of
a
white
stallion
the
public
who
knew
english
composed
excellent
telegrams
such
as
laurel
bank
umballa
horse
is
arabian
as
already
advised
sorrowful
delayed
pedigree
which
am
translating
and
later
to
the
same
address
sorrowful
delay
will
forward
pedigree
to
his
at
delhi
he
wired
ullah
have
wired
two
thousand
rupees
your
credit
luchman
narain
bank
this
was
entirely
in
the
way
of
trade
but
every
one
of
those
telegrams
was
discussed
and
rediscussed
by
parties
who
conceived
themselves
to
be
interested
before
they
went
over
to
the
railway
station
in
charge
of
a
foolish
balti
who
allowed
all
sorts
of
people
to
read
them
on
the
road
when
in
mahbub
own
picturesque
language
he
had
muddied
the
wells
of
inquiry
with
the
stick
of
precaution
kim
had
dropped
on
him
sent
from
heaven
and
being
as
prompt
as
he
was
unscrupulous
mahbub
ali
used
to
taking
all
sorts
of
gusty
chances
pressed
him
into
service
on
the
spot
a
wandering
lama
with
a
might
attract
a
interest
as
they
wandered
about
india
the
land
of
pilgrims
but
no
one
would
suspect
them
or
what
was
more
to
the
point
rob
he
called
for
a
new
to
his
hookah
and
considered
the
case
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
and
the
boy
came
to
harm
the
paper
would
incriminate
nobody
and
he
would
go
up
to
umballa
leisurely
and
at
a
certain
risk
of
exciting
fresh
suspicion
repeat
his
tale
by
word
of
mouth
to
the
people
concerned
but
report
was
the
kernel
of
the
whole
affair
and
it
would
be
distinctly
inconvenient
if
that
failed
to
come
to
hand
however
god
was
great
and
mahbub
ali
felt
he
had
done
all
he
could
for
the
time
being
kim
was
the
one
soul
in
the
world
who
had
never
told
him
a
lie
that
would
have
been
a
fatal
blot
on
kim
character
if
mahbub
had
not
known
that
to
others
for
his
own
ends
or
mahbub
business
kim
could
lie
like
an
oriental
then
mahbub
ali
rolled
across
the
serai
to
the
gate
of
the
harpies
who
paint
their
eyes
and
trap
the
stranger
and
was
at
some
pains
to
call
on
the
one
girl
who
he
had
reason
to
believe
was
a
particular
friend
of
a
kashmiri
pundit
who
had
waylaid
his
simple
balti
in
the
matter
of
the
telegrams
it
was
an
utterly
foolish
thing
to
do
because
they
fell
to
drinking
perfumed
brandy
against
the
law
of
the
prophet
and
mahbub
grew
wonderfully
drunk
and
the
gates
of
his
mouth
were
loosened
and
he
pursued
the
flower
of
delight
with
the
feet
of
intoxication
till
he
fell
flat
among
the
cushions
where
the
flower
of
delight
aided
by
a
kashmiri
pundit
searched
him
from
head
to
foot
most
thoroughly
about
the
same
hour
kim
heard
soft
feet
in
mahbub
deserted
stall
the
curiously
enough
had
left
his
door
unlocked
and
his
men
were
busy
celebrating
their
return
to
india
with
a
whole
sheep
of
mahbub
bounty
a
sleek
young
gentleman
from
delhi
armed
with
a
bunch
of
keys
which
the
flower
had
unshackled
from
the
senseless
belt
went
through
every
single
box
bundle
mat
and
in
mahbub
possession
even
more
systematically
than
the
flower
and
the
pundit
were
searching
the
owner
i
think
said
the
flower
scornfully
an
hour
later
one
rounded
elbow
on
the
snoring
carcass
he
is
no
more
than
a
pig
of
an
afghan
with
no
thought
except
women
and
horses
moreover
he
may
have
sent
it
away
by
now
if
ever
there
were
such
a
thing
in
a
matter
touching
five
kings
it
would
be
next
his
black
heart
said
the
pundit
there
nothing
the
delhi
man
laughed
and
resettled
his
turban
as
he
entered
searched
between
the
soles
of
his
slippers
as
the
flower
searched
his
clothes
this
is
not
the
man
but
another
i
leave
little
unseen
did
not
say
he
was
the
very
man
said
the
pundit
thoughtfully
said
look
if
he
be
the
man
since
our
counsels
are
troubled
north
country
is
full
of
as
an
old
coat
of
lice
there
is
sikandar
khan
nur
ali
beg
and
farrukh
shah
all
heads
of
kafilas
caravans
who
deal
there
said
the
flower
have
not
yet
come
in
said
the
pundit
must
ensnare
them
later
phew
said
the
flower
with
deep
disgust
rolling
mahbub
head
from
her
lap
earn
my
money
farrukh
shah

a

ali

a

and
old
sikandar
khan
yaie
go
i
sleep
now
this
swine
will
not
stir
till
dawn
when
mahbub
woke
the
flower
talked
to
him
severely
on
the
sin
of
drunkenness
asiatics
do
not
wink
when
they
have
outmanoeuvred
an
enemy
but
as
mahbub
ali
cleared
his
throat
tightened
his
belt
and
staggered
forth
under
the
early
morning
stars
he
came
very
near
to
it
a
colt
trick
said
he
to
himself
if
every
girl
in
peshawur
did
not
use
it
but
was
prettily
done
now
god
he
knows
how
many
more
there
be
upon
the
road
who
have
orders
to
test
me
perhaps
with
the
knife
so
it
stands
that
the
boy
must
go
to
umballa
and
by
rail
for
the
writing
is
something
urgent
i
abide
here
following
the
flower
and
drinking
wine
as
an
afghan
coper
should
he
halted
at
the
stall
next
but
one
to
his
own
his
men
lay
there
heavy
with
sleep
there
was
no
sign
of
kim
or
the
lama
he
stirred
a
sleeper
went
those
who
lay
here
last
even
the
lama
and
the
boy
is
aught
missing
grunted
the
man
old
madman
rose
at
second
cockcrow
saying
he
would
go
to
benares
and
the
young
one
led
him
away
curse
of
allah
on
all
unbelievers
said
mahbub
heartily
and
climbed
into
his
own
stall
growling
in
his
beard
but
it
was
kim
who
had
wakened
the
lama
kim
with
one
eye
laid
against
a
in
the
planking
who
had
seen
the
delhi
man
search
through
the
boxes
this
was
no
common
thief
that
turned
over
letters
bills
and
saddles
no
mere
burglar
who
ran
a
little
knife
sideways
into
the
soles
of
mahbub
slippers
or
picked
the
seams
of
the
so
deftly
at
first
kim
had
been
minded
to
give
the
alarm
the
choor
choor
thief
thief
that
sets
the
serai
ablaze
of
nights
but
he
looked
more
carefully
and
hand
on
amulet
drew
his
own
conclusions
must
be
the
pedigree
of
that
said
he
thing
that
i
carry
to
umballa
better
that
we
go
now
those
who
search
bags
with
knives
may
presently
search
bellies
with
knives
surely
there
is
a
woman
behind
this
hai
hai
in
a
whisper
to
the
old
man
it
is
time
time
to
go
to
benares
the
lama
rose
obediently
and
they
passed
out
of
the
serai
like
shadows
chapter
and
whoso
will
from
pride
released
contemning
neither
creed
nor

may
feel
the

entered
the

in
the

of
night
the
electrics
sizzling
over
the
where
they

the
heavy

the
lama
recoiling
from
the
hollow
echoing
darkness
the
glimmer
of
rails
between
the
masonry
platforms
and
the
maze
of
girders
above
he
stood
in
a
gigantic
stone
hall
paved
it
seemed
with
the
sheeted
dead
passengers
who
had
taken
their
tickets
overnight
and
were
sleeping
in
the
all

of
the

he
replied
petulantly
one
benares
then
quick
she
comes
thou
the
purse
the
lama
not
so
well
used
to
trains
as
he
had
pretended
started
as
the
roared
in
the
sleepers
sprang
to
life
and
the
station
filled
with
clamour
and
shoutings
cries
of
water
and
sweetmeat
vendors
shouts
of
native
policemen
and
shrill
yells
of
women
gathering
up
their

their

their

only
the
it
will
not

amazed
at
the

immense
simplicity
he
had
handed
him
a
small
bag
full
of
rupees
kim
asked
and
paid
for
a
ticket
to
umballa
a
sleepy
clerk
grunted
and
flung
out
a
ticket
to
the
next
station
just
six
miles
distant
said
kim
scanning
it
with
a
grin
may
serve
for
farmers
but
i
live
in
the
city
of
lahore
it
was
cleverly
done
babu
now
give
the
ticket
to
umballa
the
babu
scowled
and
dealt
the
proper
ticket
another
to
amritzar
said
kim
who
had
no
notion
of
spending
mahbub
ali
money
on
anything
so
crude
as
a
paid
ride
to
umballa
price
is
so
much
the
small
money
in
return
is
just
so
much
i
know
the
ways
of
the
never
did
yogi
need
chela
as
thou
dost
he
went
on
merrily
to
the
bewildered
lama
would
have
flung
thee
out
at
mian
mir
but
for
me
this
way
come
he
returned
the
money
keeping
only
one
anna
in
each
rupee
of
the
price
of
the
umballa
ticket
as
his
commission
the
immemorial
commission
of
asia
the
lama
jibbed
at
the
open
door
of
a
crowded
carriage
it
not
better
to

said
he
weakly
a
burly
sikh
artisan
thrust
forth
his

the

of
a

jullundur
district
our
night

strictly
kept

a

soldier
going

the

why

cried
kim
shrilled
the
amritzar
girl
has
never

the
cultivator
putting
out
a
large
brown
hand
and
hauling
him
in
is
it
done
father
but
i
sit
on
the
floor
it
is
against
the
rule
to

said
the
lama
it
cramps
me

began
the
pursing
his
lips
there
is
not

rule
of
right
living
which
these
do
not

we
sit

side

outrageously
shameless

said
the

scowling
at
the
amritzar
girl
making
eyes
at
the
young
sepoy
said
we
might
have
gone
by
cart
along
the
road

the
husband
thus
have
saved
some
money
and
spent
twice
over

and
the

tittered
are
all
one
to
me
said
the
amritzar
girl
we
believe
snorted
the
cultivator
wife
malignantly
but
all
who
serve
the
sirkar
with

in

are
as
it

of
that
opinion
said
the
soldier
with
a
scowl
at
the
placid
old
man
in
the
corner
sikhs
thought
so
when
our
two
companies
came
to
help
them
at
the
pirzai
kotal
in
the
face
of
eight
afridi
standards
on
the
ridge
not
three
months
gone
he
told
the
story
of
a
border
action
in
which
the
dogra
companies
of
the
ludhiana
sikhs
had
acquitted
themselves
well
the
amritzar
girl
smiled
for
she
knew
the
talk
was
to
win
her
approval
said
the
cultivator
wife
at
the
end
their
villages
were
burnt
and
their
little
children
made
homeless
had
marked
our
dead
they
paid
a
great
payment
after
we
of
the
sikhs
had
schooled
them
so
it
was
is
this
amritzar
and
here
they
cut
our
tickets
said
the
banker
fumbling
at
his
belt
the
lamps
were
paling
in
the
dawn
when
the
guard
came
round
is
a
slow
business
in
the
east
where

secrete
their

in
all
sorts
of
curious
places

was
told

kim
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
protesting
that
the
lama
was
his
father
and
his
mother
that
he
was
the
prop
of
the
lama
declining
years
and
that
the
lama
would
die
without
his
care
all
the
carriage
bade
the
guard
be
merciful
the
banker
was
specially
eloquent
here
but
the
guard
hauled
kim
on
to
the
platform
the
lama
blinked
he
could
not
overtake
the
situation
and
kim
lifted
up
his
voice
and
wept
outside
the
carriage
window

stepped
out
with

the
girl
looked
up
at
the
lama
who
had
mechanically
followed
kim
to
the
platform
he
bowed
his
head
that
he
might
not
see
her
and
muttered
in
tibetan
as
she
passed
on
with
the
crowd
come

said
the
cultivator

cried
the
banker
only
was
it
sufficient
for
the
ticket

to

across

levels
all
the
rich
punjab
lay
out
in
the
splendour
of
the
keen
sun
the
lama
flinched
a
little
as
the
swung

the
speed

the

with
a
patronizing
grin

two
days
at
even
we

enter
umballa
that

still
far
from
benares
said
the
lama
wearily
mumbling
over
the
cakes
that
kim
offered
they
all
unloosed
their
bundles
and
made
their
morning
meal
then
the
banker
the
cultivator
and
the
soldier
prepared
their
pipes
and
wrapped
the
compartment
in
choking
acrid
smoke
spitting
and
coughing
and
enjoying
themselves
the
sikh
and
the
cultivator
wife
chewed
pan
the
lama
took
snuff
and
told
his
beads
while
kim
smiled
over
the
comfort
of
a
full
stomach
rivers

said
the
lama
of
a
sudden
to
the
carriage
at
large
have
gunga
returned
the
banker
when
the
little
titter
had
subsided
others
other
than
gunga
but
in
my
mind
was
the
thought
of
a
certain
river
of
healing
is
gunga
who
bathes
in
her
is
made
clean
and
goes
to
the
gods
thrice
have
i
made
pilgrimage
to

he
looked
round
proudly
was
need
said
the
young
sepoy
drily
and
the
travellers
laugh
turned
against
the
banker
to
return
again
to
the
gods
the
lama
muttered
to
go
forth
on
the
round
of
lives
anew
still
tied
to
the
wheel
he
shook
his
head
testily
maybe
there
is
a
mistake
who
then
made
gunga
in
the
beginning
gods
of
what
known
faith
art
thou
the
banker
said
appalled
follow
the
law
the
most
excellent
law
so
it
was
the
gods
that
made
gunga
what
like
of
gods
were
they
the
carriage
looked
at
him
in
amazement
it
was
inconceivable
that
anyone
should
be
ignorant
of
gunga
what
is
thy
god
said
the
at
last
said
the
lama
shifting
the
rosary
to
his
hand
for
i
speak
of
him
now
o
people
of
hind
listen
he
began
in
urdu
the
tale
of
the
lord
buddha
but
borne
by
his
own
thoughts
slid
into
tibetan
and
texts
from
a
chinese
book
of
the
buddha
life
the
gentle
tolerant
folk
looked
on
reverently
all
india
is
full
of
holy
men
stammering
gospels
in
strange
tongues
shaken
and
consumed
in
the
fires
of
their
own
zeal
dreamers
babblers
and
visionaries
as
it
has
been
from
the
beginning
and
will
continue
to
the
end
said
the
soldier
of
the
ludhiana
sikhs
was
a
mohammedan
regiment
lay
next
to
us
at
the
pirzai
kotal
and
a
priest
of
theirs
he
was
as
i
remember
a
naik
when
the
fit
was
on
him
spake
prophecies
but
the
mad
all
are
in
god
keeping
his
officers
overlooked
much
in
that
man
the
lama
fell
back
on
urdu
remembering
that
he
was
in
a
strange
land
the
tale
of
the
arrow
which
our
lord
loosed
from
the
bow
he
said
this
was
much
more
to
their
taste
and
they
listened
curiously
while
he
told
it
o
people
of
hind
i
go
to
seek
that
river
know
ye
aught
that
may
guide
me
for
we
be
all
men
and
women
in
evil
case
is
gunga
and
gunga
alone
who
washes
away
sin
ran
the
murmur
round
the
carriage
past
question
we
have
good
gods
said
the
cultivator
wife
looking
out
of
the
window
how
they
have
blessed
the
crops
search
every
river
in
the
punjab
is
no
small
matter
said
her
husband
me
a
stream
that
leaves
good
silt
on
my
land
suffices
and
i
thank
bhumia
the
god
of
the
he
shrugged
one
knotted
bronzed
shoulder
you
our
lord
came
so
far
north
said
the
lama
turning
to
kim
may
be
kim
replied
soothingly
as
he
spat
red
on
the
floor
last
of
the
great
ones
said
the
sikh
with
authority
sikander
julkarn
alexander
the
great
he
paved
the
streets
of
jullundur
and
built
a
great
tank
near
umballa
that
pavement
holds
to
this
day
and
the
tank
is
there
also
i
never
heard
of
thy
god
thy
hair
grow
long
and
talk
punjabi
said
the
young
soldier
jestingly
to
kim
quoting
a
northern
proverb
is
all
that
makes
a
sikh
but
he
did
not
say
this
very
loud
the
lama
sighed
and
shrank
into
himself
a
dingy
shapeless
mass
in
the
pauses
of
their
talk
they
could
hear
the
low
droning
mane
pudme
hum
om
mane
pudme
hum
and
the
thick
click
of
the
wooden
rosary
beads
irks
me
he
said
at
last
speed
and
the
clatter
irk
me
moreover
my
chela
i
think
that
maybe
we
have
that
river
peace
said
kim
not
the
river
near
benares
we
are
yet
far
from
the
place
if
our
lord
came
north
it
may
be
any
one
of
these
little
ones
that
we
have
run
across
do
not
know
thou
wast
sent
to
me
wast
thou
sent
to
me
for
the
merit
i
had
acquired
over
yonder
at
from
beside
the
cannon
didst
thou
come
bearing
two
faces
and
two
garbs
one
must
not
speak
of
these
things
here
whispered
kim
was
but
one
of
me
think
again
and
thou
wilt
remember
a
boy
a
hindu
boy
by
the
great
green
cannon
was
there
not
also
an
englishman
with
a
white
beard
holy
among
images
who
himself
made
more
sure
my
assurance
of
the
river
of
the
arrow
we
went
to
the
in
lahore
to
pray
before
the
gods
there
kim
explained
to
the
openly
listening
company
the
sahib
of
the
wonder
house
talked
to
him
yes
this
is
truth
as
a
brother
he
is
a
very
holy
man
from
far
beyond
the
hills
rest
thou
in
time
we
come
to
umballa
my
river
the
river
of
my
healing
then
if
it
please
thee
we
will
go
hunting
for
that
river
on
foot
so
that
we
miss
nothing
not
even
a
little
rivulet
in
a
thou
hast
a
search
of
thine
own
the
lama
very
pleased
that
he
remembered
so
well
sat
bolt
upright
said
kim
humouring
him
the
boy
was
entirely
happy
to
be
out
chewing
pan
and
seeing
new
people
in
the
great
world
was
a
bull
a
red
bull
that
shall
come
and
help
thee
and
carry
thee
whither
i
have
forgotten
a
red
bull
on
a
green
field
was
it
not
it
will
carry
me
nowhere
said
kim
is
but
a
tale
i
told
thee
is
this
the
cultivator
wife
leaned
forward
her
bracelets
clinking
on
her
arm
ye
both
dream
dreams
a
red
bull
on
a
green
field
that
shall
carry
thee
to
the
heavens
or
what
was
it
a
vision
did
one
make
a
prophecy
we
have
a
red
bull
in
our
village
behind
jullundur
city
and
he
grazes
by
choice
in
the
very
greenest
of
our
fields
a
woman
an
old
wife
tale
and
a
a
leaf
and
a
thread
they
will
weave
wonderful
things
said
the
sikh
holy
men
dream
dreams
and
by
following
holy
men
their
disciples
attain
that
power
red
bull
on
a
green
field
was
it
the
lama
repeated
a
former
life
it
may
be
thou
hast
acquired
merit
and
the
bull
will
come
to
reward
thee
nay
it
was
but
a
tale
one
told
to
me
for
a
jest
belike
but
i
will
seek
the
bull
about
umballa
and
thou
canst
look
for
thy
river
and
rest
from
the
clatter
of
the
train
may
be
that
the
bull
knows
that
he
is
sent
to
guide
us
both
said
the
lama
hopefully
as
a
child
then
to
the
company
indicating
kim
one
was
sent
to
me
but
yesterday
he
is
not
i
think
of
this
world
aplenty
have
i
met
and
holy
men
to
boot
but
never
such
a
yogi
nor
such
a
disciple
said
the
woman
her
husband
touched
his
forehead
lightly
with
one
finger
and
smiled
but
the
next
time
the
lama
would
eat
they
took
care
to
give
him
of
their
best
and
at
last
tired
sleepy
and
dusty
they
reached
umballa
city
station
abide
here
upon
a
said
the
cultivator
wife
to
kim
lodge
with
my
man
cousin
younger
brother
there
is
room
also
in
the
courtyard
for
thy
yogi
and
for
thee
will
will
he
give
me
a
blessing
holy
man
a
woman
with
a
heart
of
gold
gives
us
lodging
for
the
night
it
is
a
kindly
land
this
land
of
the
south
see
how
we
have
been
helped
since
the
dawn
the
lama
bowed
his
head
in
benediction
fill
my
cousin
younger
brother
house
with
wastrels
the
husband
began
as
he
shouldered
his
heavy
bamboo
staff
cousin
younger
brother
owes
my
father
cousin
something
yet
on
his
daughter
said
the
woman
crisply
him
put
their
food
to
that
account
the
yogi
will
beg
i
doubt
not
i
beg
for
him
said
kim
anxious
only
to
get
the
lama
under
shelter
for
the
night
that
he
might
seek
mahbub
ali
englishman
and
deliver
himself
of
the
white
stallion
pedigree
said
he
when
the
lama
had
come
to
an
anchor
in
the
inner
courtyard
of
a
decent
hindu
house
behind
the
cantonments
go
away
for
a
while
to
to
buy
us
victual
in
the
bazar
do
not
stray
abroad
till
i
return
wilt
return
thou
wilt
surely
return
the
old
man
caught
at
his
wrist
thou
wilt
return
in
this
very
same
shape
is
it
too
late
to
look
tonight
for
the
river
late
and
too
dark
be
comforted
think
how
far
thou
art
on
the
road
an
hundred
miles
from
lahore
already
and
farther
from
my
monastery
alas
it
is
a
great
and
terrible
world
kim
stole
out
and
away
as
unremarkable
a
figure
as
ever
carried
his
own
and
a
few
score
thousand
other
folk
fate
slung
round
his
neck
mahbub
ali
directions
left
him
little
doubt
of
the
house
in
which
his
englishman
lived
and
a
groom
bringing
a
home
from
the
club
made
him
quite
sure
it
remained
only
to
identify
his
man
and
kim
slipped
through
the
garden
hedge
and
hid
in
a
clump
of
plumed
grass
close
to
the
veranda
the
house
blazed
with
lights
and
servants
moved
about
tables
dressed
with
flowers
glass
and
silver
presently
forth
came
an
englishman
dressed
in
black
and
white
humming
a
tune
it
was
too
dark
to
see
his
face
so
kim
tried
an
old
experiment
of
the
poor
the
man
backed
towards
the
voice
ali
says
what
says
mahbub
ali
he
made
no
attempt
to
look
for
the
speaker
and
that
showed
kim
that
he
knew
pedigree
of
the
white
stallion
is
fully
established
proof
is
there
the
englishman
switched
at
the
in
the
side
of
the
drive
ali
has
given
me
this
proof
kim
flipped
the
wad
of
folded
paper
into
the
air
and
it
fell
in
the
path
beside
the
man
who
put
his
foot
on
it
as
a
gardener
came
round
the
corner
when
the
servant
passed
he
picked
it
up
dropped
a
rupee
kim
could
hear
the
clink
and
strode
into
the
house
never
turning
round
swiftly
kim
took
up
the
money
but
for
all
his
training
he
was
irish
enough
by
birth
to
reckon
silver
the
least
part
of
any
game
what
he
desired
was
the
visible
effect
of
action
so
instead
of
slinking
away
he
lay
close
in
the
grass
and
wormed
nearer
to
the
house
he
saw
indian
bungalows
are
open
through
and
through
the
englishman
return
to
a
small
in
a
comer
of
the
veranda
that
was
half
office
littered
with
papers
and
and
sit
down
to
study
mahbub
ali
message
his
face
by
the
full
ray
of
the
kerosene
lamp
changed
and
darkened
and
kim
used
as
every
beggar
must
be
to
watching
countenances
took
good
note
will
dear
called
a
woman
voice
ought
to
be
in
the
they
be
here
in
a
minute
the
man
still
read
intently
said
the
voice
five
minutes
later
come
i
can
hear
the
troopers
in
the
drive
the
man
dashed
out
bareheaded
as
a
big
landau
with
four
native
troopers
behind
it
halted
at
the
veranda
and
a
tall
black
haired
man
erect
as
an
arrow
swung
out
preceded
by
a
young
officer
who
laughed
pleasantly
flat
on
his
belly
lay
kim
almost
touching
the
high
wheels
his
man
and
the
black
stranger
exchanged
two
sentences
sir
said
the
young
officer
promptly
waits
while
a
horse
is
concerned
sha
be
more
than
twenty
minutes
said
kim
man
can
do
the
honours
keep
amused
and
all
that
one
of
the
troopers
to
wait
said
the
tall
man
and
they
both
passed
into
the
together
as
the
landau
rolled
away
kim
saw
their
heads
bent
over
mahbub
ali
message
and
heard
the
voices
one
low
and
deferential
the
other
sharp
and
decisive
is
a
question
of
weeks
it
is
a
question
of
days
hours
almost
said
the
elder
been
expecting
it
for
some
time
but
this
he
tapped
mahbub
ali
paper
it
grogan
dining
here
is
he
sir
and
macklin
too
good
i
speak
to
them
myself
the
matter
will
be
referred
to
the
council
of
course
but
this
is
a
case
where
one
is
justified
in
assuming
that
we
take
action
at
once
warn
the
pined
and
peshawar
brigades
it
will
disorganize
all
the
summer
reliefs
but
we
help
that
this
comes
of
not
smashing
them
thoroughly
the
first
time
eight
thousand
should
be
enough
about
artillery
sir
must
consult
macklin
it
means
war
punishment
when
a
man
is
bound
by
the
action
of
his
predecessor
may
have
lied
bears
out
the
other
information
practically
they
showed
their
hand
six
months
back
but
devenish
would
have
it
there
was
a
chance
of
peace
of
course
they
used
it
to
make
themselves
stronger
send
off
those
telegrams
at
once
the
new
code
not
the
old
mine
and
wharton
i
do
think
we
need
keep
the
ladies
waiting
any
longer
we
can
settle
the
rest
over
the
cigars
i
thought
it
was
coming
punishment
not
war
as
the
trooper
cantered
off
kim
crawled
round
to
the
back
of
the
house
where
going
on
his
lahore
experiences
he
judged
there
would
be
food
and
information
the
kitchen
was
crowded
with
excited
scullions
one
of
whom
kicked
him
said
kim
feigning
tears
came
only
to
wash
dishes
in
return
for
a
bellyful
umballa
is
on
the
same
errand
get
hence
they
go
in
now
with
the
soup
think
you
that
we
who
serve
creighton
sahib
need
strange
scullions
to
help
us
through
a
big
dinner
is
a
very
big
dinner
said
kim
looking
at
the
plates
wonder
the
guest
of
honour
is
none
other
than
the
sahib
the
said
kim
with
the
correct
guttural
note
of
wonder
he
had
learned
what
he
wanted
and
when
the
scullion
turned
he
was
gone
all
that
trouble
said
he
to
himself
thinking
as
usual
in
hindustani
a
horse
pedigree
mahbub
ali
should
have
come
to
me
to
learn
a
little
lying
every
time
before
that
i
have
borne
a
message
it
concerned
a
woman
now
it
is
men
better
the
tall
man
said
that
they
will
loose
a
great
army
to
punish
someone
somewhere
the
news
goes
to
pindi
and
peshawur
there
are
also
guns
would
i
had
crept
nearer
it
is
big
news
he
returned
to
find
the
cultivator
cousin
younger
brother
discussing
the
family
in
all
its
bearings
with
the
cultivator
and
his
wife
and
a
few
friends
while
the
lama
dozed
after
the
evening
meal
some
one
passed
him
a
and
kim
felt
very
much
of
a
man
as
he
pulled
at
the
smooth
his
legs
spread
abroad
in
the
moonlight
his
tongue
clicking
in
remarks
from
time
to
time
his
hosts
were
most
polite
for
the
cultivator
wife
had
told
them
of
his
vision
of
the
red
bull
and
of
his
probable
descent
from
another
world
moreover
the
lama
was
a
great
and
venerable
curiosity
the
family
priest
an
old
tolerant
sarsut
brahmin
dropped
in
later
and
naturally
started
a
theological
argument
to
impress
the
family
by
creed
of
course
they
were
all
on
their
priest
side
but
the
lama
was
the
guest
and
the
novelty
his
gentle
kindliness
and
his
impressive
chinese
quotations
that
sounded
like
spells
delighted
them
hugely
and
in
this
sympathetic
simple
air
he
expanded
like
the
bodhisat
own
lotus
speaking
of
his
life
in
the
great
hills
of
before
as
he
said
rose
up
to
seek
enlightenment
then
it
came
out
that
in
those
worldly
days
he
had
been
a
at
casting
horoscopes
and
nativities
and
the
family
priest
led
him
on
to
describe
his
methods
each
giving
the
planets
names
that
the
other
could
not
understand
and
pointing
upwards
as
the
big
stars
sailed
across
the
dark
the
children
of
the
house
tugged
unrebuked
at
his
rosary
and
he
clean
forgot
the
rule
which
forbids
looking
at
women
as
he
talked
of
enduring
snows
landslips
blocked
passes
the
remote
cliffs
where
men
find
sapphires
and
turquoise
and
that
wonderful
upland
road
that
leads
at
last
into
great
china
itself
thinkest
thou
of
this
one
said
the
cultivator
aside
to
the
priest
holy
man
a
holy
man
indeed
his
gods
are
not
the
gods
but
his
feet
are
upon
the
way
was
the
answer
his
methods
of
nativities
though
that
is
beyond
thee
are
wise
and
sure
me
said
kim
lazily
i
find
my
red
bull
on
a
green
field
as
was
promised
me
knowledge
hast
thou
of
thy
the
priest
asked
swelling
with
importance
first
and
second
cockcrow
of
the
first
night
in
may
what
year
do
not
know
but
upon
the
hour
that
i
cried
first
fell
the
great
earthquake
in
srinagar
which
is
in
kashmir
this
kim
had
from
the
woman
who
took
care
of

and
she
again
from
kimball
the
earthquake
had
been
felt
in
india
and
for
long
stood
a
leading
date
in
the
punjab
said
a
woman
excitedly
this
seemed
to
make
kim
supernatural
origin
more
certain
not
such
an
one
daughter
born
then
her
mother
bore
her
husband
four
sons
in
four
years
all
likely
boys
cried
the
cultivator
wife
sitting
outside
the
circle
in
the
shadow
reared
in
the
knowledge
said
the
family
priest
how
the
planets
stood
in
their
houses
upon
that
night
he
began
to
draw
in
the
dust
of
the
courtyard
least
thou
hast
good
claim
to
a
half
of
the
house
of
the
bull
how
runs
thy
prophecy
a
day
said
kim
delighted
at
the
sensation
he
was
creating
shall
be
made
great
by
means
of
a
red
bull
on
a
green
field
but
first
there
will
enter
two
men
making
all
things
ready
thus
ever
at
the
opening
of
a
vision
a
thick
darkness
that
clears
slowly
anon
one
enters
with
a
broom
making
ready
the
place
then
begins
the
sight
two
men
thou
sayest
ay
ay
the
sun
leaving
the
house
of
the
bull
enters
that
of
the
twins
hence
the
two
men
of
the
prophecy
let
us
now
consider
fetch
me
a
twig
little
one
he
knitted
his
brows
scratched
smoothed
out
and
scratched
again
in
the
dust
mysterious
signs
to
the
wonder
of
all
save
the
lama
who
with
fine
instinct
forbore
to
interfere
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
he
tossed
the
twig
from
him
with
a
grunt
thus
say
the
stars
within
three
days
come
the
two
men
to
make
all
things
ready
after
them
follows
the
bull
but
the
sign
over
against
him
is
the
sign
of
war
and
armed
men
was
indeed
a
man
of
the
ludhiana
sikhs
in
the
carriage
from
lahore
said
the
cultivator
wife
hopefully
armed
men
many
hundreds
what
concern
hast
thou
with
war
said
the
priest
to
kim
is
a
red
and
an
angry
sign
of
war
to
be
loosed
very
soon
none
said
the
lama
earnestly
seek
only
peace
and
our
river
kim
smiled
remembering
what
he
had
overheard
in
the
decidedly
he
was
a
favourite
of
the
stars
the
priest
brushed
his
foot
over
the
rude
horoscope
than
this
i
can
not
see
in
three
days
comes
the
bull
to
thee
boy
my
river
my
river
pleaded
the
lama
had
hoped
his
bull
would
lead
us
both
to
the
river
for
that
wondrous
river
my
brother
the
priest
replied
things
are
not
common
next
morning
though
they
were
pressed
to
stay
the
lama
insisted
on
departure
they
gave
kim
a
large
bundle
of
good
food
and
nearly
three
annas
in
copper
money
for
the
needs
of
the
road
and
with
many
blessings
watched
the
two
go
southward
in
the
dawn
it
is
that
these
and
such
as
these
could
not
be
freed
from
then
would
only
evil
people
be
left
on
the
earth
and
who
would
give
us
meat
and
shelter
quoth
kim
stepping
merrily
under
his
burden
is
a
small
stream
let
us
look
said
the
lama
and
he
led
from
the
white
road
across
the
fields
walking
into
a
very
nest
of
pariah
dogs
chapter
yea
voice
of
every
soul
that
clung
to
life
that
strove
from
rung
to
rung
when
devadatta
rule
was
young
the
warm
wind
brings
kamakura
buddha
at
kamakura
behind
them
an
angry
farmer
brandished
a
bamboo
pole
he
was
a
arain
by
caste
growing
vegetables
and
flowers
for
umballa
city
and
well
kim
knew
the
breed
an
one
said
the
lama
disregarding
the
dogs
impolite
to
strangers
intemperate
of
speech
and
uncharitable
be
warned
by
his
demeanour
my
disciple
shameless
beggars
shouted
the
farmer
get
hence
go
the
lama
returned
with
quiet
dignity
go
from
these
unblessed
fields
said
kim
sucking
in
his
breath
the
next
crops
fail
thou
canst
only
blame
thine
own
tongue
the
man
shuffled
uneasily
in
his
slippers
land
is
full
of
beggars
he
began
half
apologetically
by
what
sign
didst
thou
know
that
we
would
beg
from
thee
o
mali
said
kim
tartly
using
the
name
that
a
least
likes
we
sought
was
to
look
at
that
river
beyond
the
field
there
forsooth
the
man
snorted
city
do
ye
hail
from
not
to
know
a
it
runs
as
straight
as
an
arrow
and
i
pay
for
the
water
as
though
it
were
molten
silver
there
is
a
branch
of
a
river
beyond
but
if
ye
need
water
i
can
give
that
and
milk
we
will
go
to
the
river
said
the
lama
striding
out
and
a
meal
the
man
stammered
as
he
looked
at
the
strange
tall
figure
i
would
not
draw
evil
upon
myself
or
my
crops
but
beggars
are
so
many
in
these
hard
days
notice
the
lama
turned
to
kim
was
led
to
speak
harshly
by
the
red
mist
of
anger
that
clearing
from
his
eyes
he
becomes
courteous
and
of
an
affable
heart
may
his
fields
be
blessed
beware
not
to
judge
men
too
hastily
o
farmer
have
met
holy
ones
who
would
have
cursed
thee
from
hearthstone
to
byre
said
kim
to
the
abashed
man
he
not
wise
and
holy
i
am
his
disciple
he
cocked
his
nose
in
the
air
loftily
and
stepped
across
the
narrow
with
great
dignity
is
no
pride
said
the
lama
after
a
pause
is
no
pride
among
such
as
follow
the
middle
way
thou
hast
said
he
was
and
discourteous
i
did
not
say
for
how
can
that
be
which
is
not
afterwards
he
amended
his
discourtesy
and
i
forgot
the
offence
moreover
he
is
as
we
are
bound
upon
the
wheel
of
things
but
he
does
not
tread
the
way
of
deliverance
he
halted
at
a
little
runlet
among
the
fields
and
considered
the
bank
how
wilt
thou
know
thy
river
said
kim
squatting
in
the
shade
of
some
tall
i
find
it
an
enlightenment
will
surely
be
given
this
i
feel
is
not
the
place
o
littlest
among
the
waters
if
only
thou
couldst
tell
me
where
runs
my
river
but
be
thou
blessed
to
make
the
fields
bear
look
kim
sprang
to
his
side
and
dragged
him
back
a
streak
glided
from
the
purple
rustling
stems
to
the
bank
stretched
its
neck
to
the
water
drank
and
lay
still
a
big
cobra
with
fixed
lidless
eyes
have
no
stick
i
have
no
stick
said
kim
will
get
me
one
and
break
his
back
he
is
upon
the
wheel
as
we
are
a
life
ascending
or
descending
very
far
from
deliverance
great
evil
must
the
soul
have
done
that
is
cast
into
this
shape
hate
all
snakes
said
kim
no
native
training
can
quench
the
white
man
horror
of
the
serpent
him
live
out
his
life
the
coiled
thing
hissed
and
half
opened
its
hood
thy
release
come
soon
brother
the
lama
continued
placidly
thou
knowledge
by
chance
of
my
river
have
i
seen
such
a
man
as
thou
art
kim
whispered
overwhelmed
the
very
snakes
understand
thy
talk
knows
he
passed
within
a
foot
of
the
cobra
poised
head
it
flattened
itself
among
the
dusty
coils
thou
he
called
over
his
shoulder
i
said
kim
go
round
he
does
no
hurt
kim
hesitated
for
a
moment
the
lama
backed
his
order
by
some
droned
chinese
quotation
which
kim
took
for
a
charm
he
obeyed
and
bounded
across
the
rivulet
and
the
snake
indeed
made
no
sign
have
i
seen
such
a
man
kim
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
now
whither
go
we
is
for
thee
to
say
i
am
old
and
a
stranger
far
from
my
own
place
but
that
the
fills
my
head
with
noises
of
i
would
go
in
it
to
benares
now
yet
by
so
going
we
may
miss
the
river
let
us
find
another
river
where
the
soil
gives
three
and
even
four
crops
a
year
through
patches
of
tobacco
long
white
radishes
and
all
that
day
they
strolled
on
turning
aside
to
every
glimpse
of
water
rousing
village
dogs
and
sleeping
villages
at
noonday
the
lama
replying
to
the
volleyed
questions
with
an
unswerving
simplicity
they
sought
a
river
a
river
of
miraculous
healing
had
any
one
knowledge
of
such
a
stream
sometimes
men
laughed
but
more
often
heard
the
story
out
to
the
end
and
offered
them
a
place
in
the
shade
a
drink
of
milk
and
a
meal
the
women
were
always
kind
and
the
little
children
as
children
are
the
world
over
alternately
shy
and
venturesome
evening
found
them
at
rest
under
the
village
tree
of
a
hamlet
talking
to
the
headman
as
the
cattle
came
in
from
the
and
the
women
prepared
the
day
last
meal
they
had
passed
beyond
the
belt
of
round
hungry
umballa
and
were
among
the
green
of
the
staple
crops
he
was
a
and
affable
elder
used
to
entertaining
strangers
he
dragged
out
a
string
bedstead
for
the
lama
set
warm
cooked
food
before
him
prepared
him
a
pipe
and
the
evening
ceremonies
being
finished
in
the
village
temple
sent
for
the
village
priest
kim
told
the
older
children
tales
of
the
size
and
beauty
of
lahore
of
railway
travel
and
city
things
while
the
men
talked
slowly
as
their
cattle
chew
the
cud
can
not
fathom
it
said
the
headman
at
last
to
the
priest
readest
thou
this
talk
the
lama
his
tale
told
was
silently
telling
his
beads
is
a
seeker
the
priest
answered
land
is
full
of
such
remember
him
who
came
only
last
month
the
fakir
with
the
tortoise
but
that
man
had
right
and
reason
for
krishna
himself
appeared
in
a
vision
promising
him
paradise
without
the
if
he
journeyed
to
prayag
this
man
seeks
no
god
who
is
within
my
knowledge
he
is
old
he
comes
from
far
off
and
he
is
mad
the
priest
replied
me
he
turned
to
the
lama
koss
six
miles
to
the
westward
runs
the
great
road
to
calcutta
i
would
go
to
benares
to
benares
to
benares
also
it
crosses
all
streams
on
this
side
of
hind
now
my
word
to
thee
holy
one
is
rest
here
till
tomorrow
then
take
the
road
it
was
the
grand
trunk
road
he
meant
test
each
stream
that
it
overpasses
for
as
i
understand
the
virtue
of
thy
river
lies
neither
in
one
pool
nor
place
but
throughout
its
length
then
if
thy
gods
will
be
assured
that
thou
wilt
come
upon
thy
freedom
is
well
said
the
lama
was
much
impressed
by
the
plan
will
begin
tomorrow
and
a
blessing
on
thee
for
showing
old
feet
such
a
near
road
a
deep
chinese
closed
the
sentence
even
the
priest
was
impressed
and
the
headman
feared
an
evil
spell
but
none
could
look
at
the
lama
simple
eager
face
and
doubt
him
long
thou
my
chela
he
said
diving
into
his
with
an
important
sniff
it
was
his
duty
to
repay
courtesy
with
courtesy
see
and
hear
the
headman
rolled
his
eye
where
kim
was
chatting
to
a
girl
in
blue
as
she
laid
crackling
thorns
on
a
fire
also
has
a
search
of
his
own
no
river
but
a
bull
yea
a
red
bull
on
a
green
field
will
some
day
raise
him
to
honour
he
is
i
think
not
altogether
of
this
world
he
was
sent
of
a
sudden
to
aid
me
in
this
search
and
his
name
is
friend
of
all
the
world
the
priest
smiled
there
friend
of
all
the
world
he
cried
across
the
smoke
art
thou
holy
one
disciple
said
kim
says
thou
are
a
but
a
spirit
buts
eat
said
kim
with
a
twinkle
i
am
hungry
is
no
jest
cried
the
lama
certain
astrologer
of
that
city
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
is
no
more
than
the
city
of
umballa
where
we
slept
last
night
kim
whispered
to
the
priest
umballa
was
it
he
cast
a
horoscope
and
declared
that
my
chela
should
find
his
desire
within
two
days
but
what
said
he
of
the
meaning
of
the
stars
friend
of
all
the
world
kim
cleared
his
throat
and
looked
around
at
the
village
greybeards
meaning
of
my
star
is
war
he
replied
pompously
somebody
laughed
at
the
little
tattered
figure
strutting
on
the
brickwork
plinth
under
the
great
tree
where
a
native
would
have
lain
down
kim
white
blood
set
him
upon
his
feet
war
he
answered
is
a
sure
prophecy
rumbled
a
deep
voice
there
is
always
war
along
the
border
as
i
know
it
was
an
old
withered
man
who
had
served
the
government
in
the
days
of
the
mutiny
as
a
native
officer
in
a
newly
raised
cavalry
regiment
the
government
had
given
him
a
good
holding
in
the
village
and
though
the
demands
of
his
sons
now
officers
on
their
own
account
had
impoverished
him
he
was
still
a
person
of
consequence
english
officials
deputy
commissioners
even
turned
aside
from
the
main
road
to
visit
him
and
on
those
occasions
he
dressed
himself
in
the
uniform
of
ancient
days
and
stood
up
like
a
ramrod
this
shall
be
a
great
war
a
war
of
eight
thousand
kim
voice
shrilled
across
the
crowd
astonishing
himself
or
our
own
regiments
the
old
man
snapped
as
though
he
were
asking
an
equal
his
tone
made
men
respect
kim
said
kim
at
a
venture
and
guns
but
the
astrologer
said
no
word
of
this
cried
the
lama
snuffing
prodigiously
in
his
excitement
i
know
the
word
has
come
to
me
who
am
this
holy
one
disciple
there
will
rise
a
war
a
war
of
eight
thousand
redcoats
from
pindi
and
peshawur
they
will
be
drawn
this
is
sure
boy
has
heard
said
the
priest
he
was
always
by
my
side
said
the
lama
should
he
know
i
did
not
know
will
make
a
clever
juggler
when
the
old
man
is
dead
muttered
the
priest
to
the
headman
new
trick
is
this
sign
give
me
a
sign
thundered
the
old
soldier
suddenly
there
were
war
my
sons
would
have
told
me
all
is
ready
thy
sons
doubt
not
will
be
told
but
it
is
a
long
road
from
thy
sons
to
the
man
in
whose
hands
these
things
lie
kim
warmed
to
the
game
for
it
reminded
him
of
experiences
in
the
line
when
for
the
sake
of
a
few
pice
he
pretended
to
know
more
than
he
knew
but
now
he
was
playing
for
larger
things
the
sheer
excitement
and
the
sense
of
power
he
drew
a
new
breath
and
went
on
man
give
me
a
sign
do
underlings
order
the
goings
of
eight
thousand
redcoats
with
guns
still
the
old
man
answered
as
though
kim
were
an
equal
thou
know
who
he
is
then
that
gives
the
order
have
seen
him
know
again
have
known
him
since
he
was
a
lieutenant
in
the
topkhana
the
artillery
tall
man
a
tall
man
with
black
hair
walking
thus
kim
took
a
few
paces
in
a
stiff
wooden
style
but
that
anyone
may
have
seen
the
crowd
were
breathless
still
through
all
this
talk
is
true
said
kim
i
will
say
more
look
now
first
the
great
man
walks
thus
then
he
thinks
thus
kim
drew
a
forefinger
over
his
forehead
and
downwards
till
it
came
to
rest
by
the
angle
of
the
jaw
he
twitches
his
fingers
thus
anon
he
thrusts
his
hat
under
his
left
armpit
kim
illustrated
the
motion
and
stood
like
a
stork
the
old
man
groaned
inarticulate
with
amazement
and
the
crowd
shivered
so
so
but
what
does
he
when
he
is
about
to
give
an
order
rubs
the
skin
at
the
back
of
his
neck
thus
then
falls
one
finger
on
the
table
and
he
makes
a
small
sniffing
noise
through
his
nose
then
he
speaks
saying
loose
such
and
such
a
regiment
call
out
such
guns
the
old
man
rose
stiffly
and
saluted
for
kim
translated
into
the
vernacular
the
clinching
sentences
he
had
heard
in
the
at
umballa
for
says
he
we
should
have
done
this
long
ago
it
is
not
war
it
is
a
chastisement
snff
i
believe
i
have
seen
him
thus
in
the
smoke
of
battles
seen
and
heard
it
is
he
saw
no
smoke
kim
voice
shifted
to
the
rapt
of
the
wayside
saw
this
in
darkness
first
came
a
man
to
make
things
clear
then
came
horsemen
then
came
he
standing
in
a
ring
of
light
the
rest
followed
as
i
have
said
old
man
have
i
spoken
truth
is
he
past
all
doubt
it
is
he
the
crowd
drew
a
long
quavering
breath
staring
alternately
at
the
old
man
still
at
attention
and
ragged
kim
against
the
purple
twilight
i
not
said
i
not
he
was
from
the
other
world
cried
the
lama
proudly
is
the
friend
of
all
the
world
he
is
the
friend
of
the
stars
least
it
does
not
concern
us
a
man
cried
thou
young
soothsayer
if
the
gift
abides
with
thee
at
all
seasons
i
have
a
cow
she
may
be
sister
to
thy
bull
for
aught
i
know
i
care
said
kim
stars
do
not
concern
themselves
with
thy
cattle
but
she
is
very
sick
a
woman
struck
in
man
is
a
buffalo
or
he
would
have
chosen
his
words
better
tell
me
if
she
recover
had
kim
been
at
all
an
ordinary
boy
he
would
have
carried
on
the
play
but
one
does
not
know
lahore
city
and
least
of
all
the
fakirs
by
the
taksali
gate
for
thirteen
years
without
also
knowing
human
nature
the
priest
looked
at
him
sideways
something
bitterly
a
dry
and
blighting
smile
there
no
priest
then
in
the
village
i
thought
i
had
seen
a
great
one
even
now
cried
kim
but
the
woman
began
thou
and
thy
husband
hoped
to
get
the
cow
cured
for
a
handful
of
thanks
the
shot
told
they
were
notoriously
the
couple
in
the
village
is
not
well
to
cheat
the
temples
give
a
young
calf
to
thine
own
priest
and
unless
thy
gods
are
angry
past
recall
she
will
give
milk
within
a
month
art
thou
purred
the
priest
approvingly
the
cunning
of
forty
years
could
have
done
better
surely
thou
hast
made
the
old
man
rich
little
flour
a
little
butter
and
a
mouthful
of
cardamoms
kim
retorted
flushed
with
the
praise
but
still
cautious
one
grow
rich
on
that
and
as
thou
canst
see
he
is
mad
but
it
serves
me
while
i
learn
the
road
at
least
he
knew
what
the
fakirs
of
the
taksali
gate
were
like
when
they
talked
among
themselves
and
copied
the
very
inflection
of
their
lewd
disciples
his
search
then
truth
or
a
cloak
to
other
ends
it
may
be
treasure
is
mad
many
times
mad
there
is
nothing
else
here
the
old
soldier
bobbled
up
and
asked
if
kim
would
accept
his
hospitality
for
the
night
the
priest
recommended
him
to
do
so
but
insisted
that
the
honour
of
entertaining
the
lama
belonged
to
the
temple
at
which
the
lama
smiled
guilelessly
kim
glanced
from
one
face
to
the
other
and
drew
his
own
conclusions
is
the
money
he
whispered
beckoning
the
old
man
off
into
the
darkness
my
bosom
where
else
it
me
quietly
and
swiftly
give
it
me
why
here
is
no
ticket
to
buy
i
thy
chela
or
am
i
not
do
i
not
safeguard
thy
old
feet
about
the
ways
give
me
the
money
and
at
dawn
i
will
return
it
he
slipped
his
hand
above
the
lama
girdle
and
brought
away
the
purse
it
so
be
it
so
the
old
man
nodded
his
head
is
a
great
and
terrible
world
i
never
knew
there
were
so
many
men
alive
in
it
next
morning
the
priest
was
in
a
very
bad
temper
but
the
lama
was
quite
happy
and
kim
had
enjoyed
a
most
interesting
evening
with
the
old
man
who
brought
out
his
cavalry
sabre
and
balancing
it
on
his
dry
knees
told
tales
of
the
mutiny
and
young
captains
thirty
years
in
their
graves
till
kim
dropped
off
to
sleep
the
air
of
this
country
is
good
said
the
lama
sleep
lightly
as
do
all
old
men
but
last
night
i
slept
unwaking
till
broad
day
even
now
i
am
heavy
a
draught
of
hot
milk
said
kim
who
had
carried
not
a
few
such
remedies
to
of
his
acquaintance
is
time
to
take
the
road
again
long
road
that
overpasses
all
the
rivers
of
hind
said
the
lama
gaily
us
go
but
how
thinkest
thou
chela
to
recompense
these
people
and
especially
the
priest
for
their
great
kindness
truly
they
are
but
parast
but
in
other
lives
maybe
they
will
receive
enlightenment
a
rupee
to
the
temple
the
thing
within
is
no
more
than
stone
and
red
paint
but
the
heart
of
man
we
must
acknowledge
when
and
where
it
is
good
one
hast
thou
ever
taken
the
road
alone
kim
looked
up
sharply
like
the
indian
crows
so
busy
about
the
fields
child
from
kulu
to
pathankot
from
kulu
where
my
first
chela
died
when
men
were
kind
to
us
we
made
offerings
and
all
men
were
throughout
all
the
hills
is
otherwise
in
hind
said
kim
drily
gods
are
and
malignant
let
them
alone
would
set
thee
on
thy
road
for
a
little
friend
of
all
the
world
thou
and
thy
yellow
man
the
old
soldier
ambled
up
the
village
street
all
shadowy
in
the
dawn
on
a
punt
pony
night
broke
up
the
fountains
of
remembrance
in
my
heart
and
it
was
as
a
blessing
to
me
truly
there
is
war
abroad
in
the
air
i
smell
it
see
i
have
brought
my
sword
he
sat
on
the
little
beast
with
the
big
sword
at
his
side
hand
dropped
on
the
pommel
staring
fiercely
over
the
flat
lands
towards
the
north
me
again
how
he
showed
in
thy
vision
come
up
and
sit
behind
me
the
beast
will
carry
two
am
this
holy
one
disciple
said
kim
as
they
cleared
the
the
villagers
seemed
almost
sorry
to
be
rid
of
them
but
the
priest
farewell
was
cold
and
distant
he
had
wasted
some
opium
on
a
man
who
carried
no
money
is
well
spoken
i
am
not
much
used
to
holy
men
but
respect
is
always
good
there
is
no
respect
in
these
days
not
even
when
a
commissioner
sahib
comes
to
see
me
but
why
should
one
whose
star
leads
him
to
war
follow
a
holy
man
he
is
a
holy
man
said
kim
earnestly
truth
and
in
talk
and
in
act
holy
he
is
not
like
the
others
i
have
never
seen
such
an
one
we
be
not
or
jugglers
or
beggars
art
not
that
i
can
see
but
i
do
not
know
that
other
he
marches
well
though
the
first
freshness
of
the
day
carried
the
lama
forward
with
long
easy
strides
he
was
deep
in
meditation
mechanically
clicking
his
rosary
they
followed
the
rutted
and
worn
country
road
that
wound
across
the
flat
between
the
great
the
line
of
the
snowcapped
himalayas
faint
to
the
eastward
all
india
was
at
work
in
the
fields
to
the
creaking
of
the
shouting
of
ploughmen
behind
their
cattle
and
the
clamour
of
the
crows
even
the
pony
felt
the
good
influence
and
almost
broke
into
a
trot
as
kim
laid
a
hand
on
the
repents
me
that
i
did
not
give
a
rupee
to
the
shrine
said
the
lama
on
the
last
bead
of
his
the
old
soldier
growled
in
his
beard
so
that
the
lama
for
the
first
time
was
aware
of
him
thou
the
river
also
said
he
turning
day
is
new
was
the
reply
need
of
a
river
save
to
water
at
before
sundown
i
come
to
show
thee
a
short
lane
to
the
big
road
is
a
courtesy
to
be
remembered
o
man
of
good
will
but
why
the
sword
the
old
soldier
looked
as
abashed
as
a
child
interrupted
in
his
game
of
sword
he
said
fumbling
it
that
was
a
fancy
of
mine
an
old
man
fancy
truly
the
police
orders
are
that
no
man
must
bear
weapons
throughout
hind
but
he
cheered
up
and
slapped
the
hilt
the
constabeels
hereabout
know
me
is
not
a
good
fancy
said
the
lama
profit
to
kill
men
little
as
i
know
but
if
evil
men
were
not
now
and
then
slain
it
would
not
be
a
good
world
for
weaponless
dreamers
i
do
not
speak
without
knowledge
who
have
seen
the
land
from
delhi
south
awash
with
blood
madness
was
that
then
gods
who
sent
it
for
a
plague
alone
know
a
madness
ate
into
all
the
army
and
they
turned
against
their
officers
that
was
the
first
evil
but
not
past
remedy
if
they
had
then
held
their
hands
but
they
chose
to
kill
the
sahibs
wives
and
children
then
came
the
sahibs
from
over
the
sea
and
called
them
to
most
strict
account
such
rumour
i
believe
reached
me
once
long
ago
they
called
it
the
black
year
as
i
remember
manner
of
life
hast
thou
led
not
to
know
the
year
a
rumour
indeed
all
earth
knew
and
trembled
earth
never
shook
but
once
upon
the
day
that
the
excellent
one
received
enlightenment
i
saw
delhi
shake
at
least
and
delhi
is
the
navel
of
the
world
they
turned
against
women
and
children
that
was
a
bad
deed
for
which
the
punishment
can
not
be
avoided
strove
to
do
so
but
with
very
small
profit
i
was
then
in
a
regiment
of
cavalry
it
broke
of
six
hundred
and
eighty
sabres
stood
fast
to
their
salt
how
many
think
you
three
of
whom
i
was
one
greater
merit
we
did
not
consider
it
merit
in
those
days
my
people
my
friends
my
brothers
fell
from
me
they
said
the
time
of
the
english
is
accomplished
let
each
strike
out
a
little
holding
for
himself
but
i
had
talked
with
the
men
of
sobraon
of
chilianwallah
of
moodkee
and
ferozeshah
i
said
abide
a
little
and
the
wind
turns
there
is
no
blessing
in
this
work
in
those
days
i
rode
seventy
miles
with
an
english
memsahib
and
her
babe
on
my
wow
that
was
a
horse
fit
for
a
man
i
placed
them
in
safety
and
back
came
i
to
my
officer
the
one
that
was
not
killed
of
our
five
give
me
work
said
i
for
i
am
an
outcast
among
my
own
kind
and
my
cousin
blood
is
wet
on
my
sabre
be
content
said
he
there
is
great
work
forward
when
this
madness
is
over
there
is
a
recompense
there
is
a
recompense
when
the
madness
is
over
surely
the
lama
muttered
half
to
himself
did
not
hang
medals
in
those
days
on
all
who
by
accident
had
heard
a
gun
fired
no
in
nineteen
pitched
battles
was
i
in
skirmishes
of
horse
and
in
small
affairs
without
number
nine
wounds
i
bear
a
medal
and
four
clasps
and
the
medal
of
an
order
for
my
captains
who
are
now
generals
remembered
me
when
the
had
accomplished
fifty
years
of
her
reign
and
all
the
land
rejoiced
they
said
give
him
the
order
of
berittish
india
i
carry
it
upon
my
neck
now
i
have
also
my
jaghir
holding
from
the
hands
of
the
state
a
free
gift
to
me
and
mine
the
men
of
the
old
days
they
are
now
commissioners
come
riding
to
me
through
the
crops
high
upon
horses
so
that
all
the
village
sees
and
we
talk
out
the
old
skirmishes
one
dead
man
name
leading
to
another
after
said
the
lama
afterwards
they
go
away
but
not
before
my
village
has
seen
at
the
last
what
wilt
thou
do
the
last
i
shall
die
after
the
gods
order
it
i
have
never
pestered
them
with
prayers
i
do
not
think
they
will
pester
me
look
you
i
have
noticed
in
my
long
life
that
those
who
eternally
break
in
upon
those
above
with
complaints
and
reports
and
bellowings
and
weepings
are
presently
sent
for
in
haste
as
our
colonel
used
to
send
for
men
who
talked
too
much
no
i
have
never
wearied
the
gods
they
will
remember
this
and
give
me
a
quiet
place
where
i
can
drive
my
lance
in
the
shade
and
wait
to
welcome
my
sons
i
have
no
less
than
three
rissaldar
majors
all
in
the
regiments
they
likewise
bound
upon
the
wheel
go
forth
from
life
to
life
from
despair
to
despair
said
the
lama
below
his
breath
uneasy
snatching
the
old
soldier
chuckled
rissaldar
majors
in
three
regiments
gamblers
a
little
but
so
am
i
they
must
be
well
mounted
and
one
can
not
take
the
horses
as
in
the
old
days
one
took
women
well
well
my
holding
can
pay
for
all
how
thinkest
thou
it
is
a
strip
but
my
men
cheat
me
i
do
not
know
how
to
ask
save
at
the
lance
point
ugh
i
grow
angry
and
i
curse
them
and
they
feign
penitence
but
behind
my
back
i
know
they
call
me
a
toothless
old
ape
thou
never
desired
any
other
thing
yes
a
thousand
times
a
straight
back
and
a
knee
once
more
a
quick
wrist
and
a
keen
eye
and
the
marrow
that
makes
a
man
oh
the
old
days
the
good
days
of
my
strength
strength
is
weakness
has
turned
so
but
fifty
years
since
i
could
have
proved
it
otherwise
the
old
soldier
retorted
driving
his
into
the
pony
lean
flank
i
know
a
river
of
great
healing
have
drank
to
the
edge
of
dropsy
all
she
gave
me
was
a
flux
and
no
sort
of
strength
is
not
gunga
the
river
that
i
know
washes
from
all
taint
of
sin
ascending
the
far
bank
one
is
assured
of
freedom
i
do
not
know
thy
life
but
thy
face
is
the
face
of
the
honourable
and
courteous
thou
hast
clung
to
thy
way
rendering
fidelity
when
it
was
hard
to
give
in
that
black
year
of
which
i
now
remember
other
tales
enter
now
upon
the
middle
way
which
is
the
path
to
freedom
hear
the
most
excellent
law
and
do
not
follow
dreams
then
old
man
the
soldier
smiled
half
saluting
be
all
babblers
at
our
age
the
lama
squatted
under
the
shade
of
a
mango
whose
shadow
played
checkerwise
over
his
face
the
soldier
sat
stiffly
on
the
pony
and
kim
making
sure
that
there
were
no
snakes
lay
down
in
the
crotch
of
the
twisted
roots
there
was
a
drowsy
buzz
of
small
life
in
hot
sunshine
a
cooing
of
doves
and
a
sleepy
drone
of
across
the
fields
slowly
and
impressively
the
lama
began
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
the
old
soldier
slid
from
his
pony
to
hear
better
as
he
said
and
sat
with
the
reins
round
his
wrist
the
lama
voice
faltered
the
periods
lengthened
kim
was
busy
watching
a
grey
squirrel
when
the
little
scolding
bunch
of
fur
close
pressed
to
the
branch
disappeared
preacher
and
audience
were
fast
asleep
the
old
officer
head
pillowed
on
his
arm
the
lama
thrown
back
against
the
where
it
showed
like
yellow
ivory
a
naked
child
toddled
up
stared
and
moved
by
some
quick
impulse
of
reverence
made
a
solemn
little
obeisance
before
the
lama
only
the
child
was
so
short
and
fat
that
it
toppled
over
sideways
and
kim
laughed
at
the
sprawling
chubby
legs
the
child
scared
and
indignant
yelled
aloud
hai
said
the
soldier
leaping
to
his
feet
is
it
what
orders
it
is
a
child
i
dreamed
it
was
an
alarm
little
one
little
one
do
not
cry
have
i
slept
that
was
discourteous
indeed
fear
i
am
afraid
roared
the
child
is
it
to
fear
two
old
men
and
a
boy
how
wilt
thou
ever
make
a
soldier
princeling
the
lama
had
waked
too
but
taking
no
direct
notice
of
the
child
clicked
his
rosary
is
that
said
the
child
stopping
a
yell
midway
have
never
seen
such
things
give
them
me
said
the
lama
smiling
and
trailing
a
loop
of
it
on
the
grass
this
is
a
handful
of
cardamoms
this
is
a
lump
of
ghi
this
is
millet
and
chillies
and
rice
a
supper
for
thee
and
me
the
child
shrieked
with
joy
and
snatched
at
the
dark
glancing
beads
said
the
old
soldier
hadst
thou
that
song
despiser
of
this
world
learned
it
in
pathankot
sitting
on
a
doorstep
said
the
lama
shyly
is
good
to
be
kind
to
babes
i
remember
before
the
sleep
came
on
us
thou
hadst
told
me
that
marriage
and
bearing
were
darkeners
of
the
true
light
upon
the
way
do
children
drop
from
heaven
in
thy
country
is
it
the
way
to
sing
them
songs
man
is
all
perfect
said
the
lama
gravely
recoiling
the
rosary
now
to
thy
mother
little
one
him
said
the
soldier
to
kim
is
ashamed
for
that
he
has
made
a
child
happy
there
was
a
very
good
householder
lost
in
thee
my
brother
hai
child

threw

always
sweet
and
as
the
little
figure
capered
away
into
the
sunshine

up
and
become
men
holy
one
i
grieve
that
i
slept
in
the
midst
of
thy
preaching
forgive
me
be
two
old
men
said
the
lama
fault
is
mine
i
listened
to
thy
talk
of
the
world
and
its
madness
and
one
fault
led
to
the
next
him
what
harm
do
thy
gods
suffer
from
play
with
a
babe
and
that
song
was
very
well
sung
let
us
go
on
and
i
will
sing
thee
the
song
of
nikal
seyn
before
delhi
the
old
song
and
they
fared
out
from
the
gloom
of
the
mango
tope
the
old
high
shrill
voice
ringing
across
the
field
as
wail
by
wail
he
unfolded
the
story
of
nikal
seyn
nicholson
the
song
that
men
sing
in
the
punjab
to
this
day
kim
was
delighted
and
the
lama
listened
with
deep
interest
nikal
seyn
is
dead
he
died
before
delhi
lances
of
the
north
take
vengeance
for
nikal
seyn
he
quavered
it
out
to
the
end
marking
the
trills
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
on
the
pony
rump
now
we
come
to
the
big
road
said
he
after
receiving
the
compliments
of
kim
for
the
lama
was
markedly
silent
is
long
since
i
have
ridden
this
way
but
thy
boy
talk
stirred
me
see
holy
one
the
great
road
which
is
the
backbone
of
all
hind
for
the
most
part
it
is
shaded
as
here
with
four
lines
of
trees
the
middle
road
all
hard
takes
the
quick
traffic
in
the
days
before
the
sahibs
travelled
up
and
down
here
in
hundreds
now
there
are
only
and
such
like
left
and
right
is
the
rougher
road
for
the
heavy
carts
grain
and
cotton
and
timber
fodder
lime
and
hides
a
man
goes
in
safety
here
for
at
every
few
koss
is
a
the
police
are
thieves
and
extortioners
i
myself
would
patrol
it
with
cavalry
young
recruits
under
a
strong
captain
but
at
least
they
do
not
suffer
any
rivals
all
castes
and
kinds
of
men
move
here
brahmins
and
chumars
bankers
and
tinkers
barbers
and
bunnias
pilgrims
and
potters
all
the
world
going
and
coming
it
is
to
me
as
a
river
from
which
i
am
withdrawn
like
a
log
after
a
flood
and
truly
the
grand
trunk
road
is
a
wonderful
spectacle
it
runs
straight
bearing
without
crowding
india
traffic
for
fifteen
hundred
miles
such
a
river
of
life
as
nowhere
else
exists
in
the
world
they
looked
at
the
length
of
it
the
white
breadth
speckled
with
folk
and
the
opposite
bears
arms
against

a
constable
called
out
laughingly
as
he
caught

of
the

not
the

thy

folly
told
thee
to

thy
carts
across
the
road
a
broken
wheel
then
take
a
broken
head
and
put
the
two
together
at
leisure
the
voice
and
a
venomous
came
out
of
a
pillar
of
dust
fifty
yards
away
where
a
cart
had
broken
down
a
thin
high
kathiawar
mare
with
eyes
and
nostrils
aflame
rocketed
out
of
the
jam
snorting
and
wincing
as
her
rider
bent
her
across
the
road
in
chase
of
a
shouting
man
he
was
tall
and
sitting
the
almost
mad

as
a

briefly
and
strove

the

to
a

to
be
beaten
before
the

cried
the
carter
i

the

the

under
the

of

and
thence
threatened

said
the
policeman
serenely
picking
his

the
horseman
delivered
one

vicious
cut
with
his
whip
and
came
on
at
a
canter
father
he
reigned
back
ten
yards
and
dismounted
the
old
man
was
off
his

in
an
instant
and
they
embraced

the
old
soldier
suddenly
the
friend

the
stars
he
brought
me
the
news
yesterday
having
seen
the
very
man
himself
in
a
vision

the

beads

eager
for
the
road

we
brought
the
news

brought
the
news
and
now
we
go
kim
his
hand
at
his
side
the
son
tossed
a
silver
coin
through
the
sunlight
grumbling
something
about
beggars
and
jugglers
it
was
a
piece
and
would
feed
them
well
for
days
the
lama
seeing
the
flash
of
the
metal
droned
a
blessing
thy
way
friend
of
all
the
world
piped
the
old
soldier
wheeling
his
scrawny
mount
once
in
all
my
days
i
have
met
a
true
prophet
who
was
not
in
the
army
father
and
son
swung
round
together
the
old
man
sitting
as
erect
as
the
younger
a
punjabi
constable
in
yellow
linen
trousers
slouched
across
the
road
he
had
seen
the
money
pass
he
cried
in
impressive
english
ye
not
that
there
is
a
takkus
of
two
annas
a
head
which
is
four
annas
on
those
who
enter
the
road
from
this
it
is
the
order
of
the
sirkar
and
the
money
is
spent
for
the
planting
of
trees
and
the
beautification
of
the
ways
the
bellies
of
the
police
said
kim
slipping
out
of
arm
reach
for
a
while
man
with
a
mud
head
think
you
we
came
from
the
nearest
pond
like
the
frog
thy
hast
thou
ever
heard
the
name
of
thy
brother
who
was
he
leave
the
boy
alone
cried
a
senior
constable
immensely
delighted
as
he
squatted
down
to
smoke
his
pipe
in
the
veranda
took
a
label
from
a
bottle
of
and
affixing
it
to
a
bridge
collected
taxes
for
a
month
from
those
who
passed
saying
that
it
was
the
sirkar
order
then
came
an
englishman
and
broke
his
head
ah
brother
i
am
a
not
a
the
policeman
drew
back
abashed
and
kim
hooted
at
him
all
down
the
road
there
ever
such
a
disciple
as
i
he
cried
merrily
to
the
lama
earth
would
have
picked
thy
bones
within
ten
mile
of
lahore
city
if
i
had
not
guarded
thee
consider
in
my
own
mind
whether
thou
art
a
spirit
sometimes
or
sometimes
an
evil
imp
said
the
lama
smiling
slowly
am
thy
chela
kim
dropped
into
step
at
his
side
that
indescribable
gait
of
the
tramp
all
the
world
over
let
us
walk
muttered
the
lama
and
to
the
click
of
his
rosary
they
walked
in
silence
mile
upon
mile
the
lama
as
usual
was
deep
in
meditation
but
kim
bright
eyes
were
open
wide
this
broad
smiling
river
of
life
he
considered
was
a
vast
improvement
on
the
cramped
and
crowded
lahore
streets
there
were
new
people
and
new
sights
at
every
stride
castes
he
knew
and
castes
that
were
altogether
out
of
his
experience
they
met
a
troop
of
sansis
with
baskets
of
lizards
and
other
unclean
food
on
their
backs
their
lean
dogs
sniffing
at
their
heels
these
people
kept
their
own
side
of
the
road
moving
at
a
quick
furtive
and
all
other
castes
gave
them
ample
room
for
the
sansi
is
deep
pollution
behind
them
walking
wide
and
stiffly
across
the
strong
shadows
the
memory
of
his
still
on
him
strode
one
newly
released
from
the
jail
his
full
stomach
and
shiny
skin
to
prove
that
the
government
fed
its
prisoners
better
than
most
honest
men
could
feed
themselves
kim
knew
that
walk
well
and
made
broad
jest
of
it
as
they
passed
then
an
akali
a
sikh
devotee
in
the
clothes
of
his
faith
with
quoits
glistening
on
the
cone
of
his
tall
blue
turban
stalked
past
returning
from
a
visit
to
one
of
the
independent
sikh
states
where
he
had
been
singing
the
ancient
glories
of
the
khalsa
to
princelings
in
and
breeches
kim
was
careful
not
to
irritate
that
man
for
the
akali
temper
is
short
and
his
arm
quick
here
and
there
they
met
or
were
overtaken
by
the
gaily
dressed
crowds
of
whole
villages
turning
out
to
some
local
fair
the
women
with
their
babes
on
their
hips
walking
behind
the
men
the
older
boys
prancing
on
sticks
of
dragging
rude
brass
models
of
locomotives
such
as
they
sell
for
a
halfpenny
or
flashing
the
sun
into
the
eyes
of
their
betters
from
cheap
toy
mirrors
one
could
see
at
a
glance
what
each
had
bought
and
if
there
were
any
doubt
it
needed
only
to
watch
the
wives
comparing
brown
arm
against
brown
arm
the
newly
purchased
dull
glass
bracelets
that
come
from
the
these
stepped
slowly
calling
one
to
the
other
and
stopping
to
haggle
with
or
to
make
a
prayer
before
one
of
the
wayside
shrines
sometimes
hindu
sometimes
mussalman
which
the
of
both
creeds
share
with
beautiful
impartiality
a
solid
line
of
blue
rising
and
falling
like
the
back
of
a
caterpillar
in
haste
would
swing
up
through
the
quivering
dust
and
trot
past
to
a
chorus
of
quick
cackling
that
was
a
gang
of
changars
the
women
who
have
taken
all
the
embankments
of
all
the
northern
railways
under
their
charge
a
clan
of
hurrying
north
on
news
of
a
job
and
wasting
no
time
by
the
road
they
belong
to
the
caste
whose
men
do
not
count
and
they
walked
with
squared
elbows
swinging
hips
and
heads
on
high
as
suits
women
who
carry
heavy
weights
a
little
later
a
marriage
procession
would
strike
into
the
grand
trunk
with
music
and
shoutings
and
a
smell
of
marigold
and
jasmine
stronger
even
than
the
reek
of
the
dust
one
could
see
the
bride
litter
a
blur
of
red
and
tinsel
staggering
through
the
haze
while
the
bridegroom
bewreathed
pony
turned
aside
to
snatch
a
mouthful
from
a
passing
then
kim
would
join
the
of
good
wishes
and
bad
jokes
wishing
the
couple
a
hundred
sons
and
no
daughters
as
the
saying
is
still
more
interesting
and
more
to
be
shouted
over
it
was
when
a
strolling
juggler
with
some
monkeys
or
a
panting
feeble
bear
or
a
woman
who
tied
goats
horns
to
her
feet
and
with
these
danced
on
a
set
the
horses
to
shying
and
the
women
to
shrill
quavers
of
amazement
the
lama
never
raised
his
eyes
he
did
not
note
the
on
his
pony
hastening
along
to
collect
the
cruel
interest
or
the
little
mob
still
in
military
formation
of
native
soldiers
on
leave
rejoicing
to
be
rid
of
their
breeches
and
puttees
and
saying
the
most
outrageous
things
to
the
most
respectable
women
in
sight
even
the
seller
of
he
did
not
see
and
kim
expected
that
he
would
at
least
buy
a
bottle
of
that
precious
stuff
he
looked
steadily
at
the
ground
and
strode
as
steadily
hour
after
hour
his
soul
busied
elsewhere
but
kim
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
joy
the
grand
trunk
at
this
point
was
built
on
an
embankment
to
guard
against
winter
floods
from
the
foothills
so
that
one
walked
as
it
were
a
little
above
the
country
along
a
stately
corridor
seeing
all
india
spread
out
to
left
and
right
it
was
beautiful
to
behold
the
grain
and
cotton
wagons
crawling
over
the
country
roads
one
could
hear
their
axles
complaining
a
mile
away
coming
nearer
till
with
shouts
and
yells
and
bad
words
they
climbed
up
the
steep
incline
and
plunged
on
to
the
hard
main
road
carter
reviling
carter
it
was
equally
beautiful
to
watch
the
people
little
clumps
of
red
and
blue
and
pink
and
white
and
saffron
turning
aside
to
go
to
their
own
villages
dispersing
and
growing
small
by
twos
and
threes
across
the
level
plain
kim
felt
these
things
though
he
could
not
give
tongue
to
his
feelings
and
so
contented
himself
with
buying
peeled
and
spitting
the
pith
generously
about
his
path
from
time
to
time
the
lama
took
snuff
and
at
last
kim
could
endure
the
silence
no
longer
is
a
good
land
the
land
of
the
south
said
he
air
is
good
the
water
is
good
eh
they
are
all
bound
upon
the
wheel
said
the
lama
from
life
after
life
to
none
of
these
has
the
way
been
shown
he
shook
himself
back
to
this
world
now
we
have
walked
a
weary
way
said
kim
we
shall
soon
come
to
a
parao
a
shall
we
stay
there
look
the
sun
is
sloping
will
receive
us
this
evening
is
all
one
this
country
is
full
of
good
folk
besides
he
sunk
his
voice
beneath
a
whisper
have
money
the
crowd
thickened
as
they
neared
the
which
marked
the
end
of
their
day
journey
a
line
of
stalls
selling
very
simple
food
and
tobacco
a
stack
of
firewood
a
a
well
a
a
few
trees
and
under
them
some
trampled
ground
dotted
with
the
black
ashes
of
old
fires
are
all
that
mark
a
parao
on
the
grand
trunk
if
you
except
the
beggars
and
the
crows
both
hungry
by
this
time
the
sun
was
driving
broad
golden
spokes
through
the
lower
branches
of
the
the
parakeets
and
doves
were
coming
home
in
their
hundreds
the
chattering
seven
sisters
talking
over
the
day
adventures
walked
back
and
forth
in
twos
and
threes
almost
under
the
feet
of
the
travellers
and
shufflings
and
scufflings
in
the
branches
showed
that
the
bats
were
ready
to
go
out
on
the
swiftly
the
light
gathered
itself
together
painted
for
an
instant
the
faces
and
the
cartwheels
and
the
bullocks
horns
as
red
as
blood
then
the
night
fell
changing
the
touch
of
the
air
drawing
a
low
even
haze
like
a
gossamer
veil
of
blue
across
the
face
of
the
country
and
bringing
out
keen
and
distinct
the
smell
of
and
cattle
and
the
good
scent
of
wheaten
cakes
cooked
on
ashes
the
evening
patrol
hurried
out
of
the
with
important
coughings
and
reiterated
orders
and
a
live
charcoal
ball
in
the
cup
of
a
wayside
carter
hookah
glowed
red
while
kim
eye
mechanically
watched
the
last
flicker
of
the
sun
on
the
brass
tweezers
the
life
of
the
parao
was
very
like
that
of
the
kashmir
serai
on
a
small
scale
kim
dived
into
the
happy
asiatic
disorder
which
if
you
only
allow
time
will
bring
you
everything
that
a
simple
man
needs
his
wants
were
few
because
since
the
lama
had
no
caste
scruples
cooked
food
from
the
nearest
stall
would
serve
but
for
luxury
sake
kim
bought
a
handful
of
to
build
a
fire
all
about
coming
and
going
round
the
little
flames
men
cried
for
oil
or
grain
or
sweetmeats
or
tobacco
jostling
one
another
while
they
waited
their
turn
at
the
well
and
under
the
men
voices
you
heard
from
halted
shuttered
carts
the
high
squeals
and
giggles
of
women
whose
faces
should
not
be
seen
in
public
nowadays
natives
are
of
opinion
that
when
their
womenfolk
travel
and
they
visit
a
good
deal
it
is
better
to
take
them
quickly
by
rail
in
a
properly
screened
compartment
and
that
custom
is
spreading
but
there
are
always
those
of
the
old
rock
who
hold
by
the
use
of
their
forefathers
and
above
all
there
are
always
the
old
women
more
conservative
than
the
men
who
toward
the
end
of
their
days
go
on
a
pilgrimage
they
being
withered
and
undesirable
do
not
under
certain
circumstances
object
to
unveiling
after
their
long
seclusion
during
which
they
have
always
been
in
business
touch
with
a
thousand
outside
interests
they
love
the
bustle
and
stir
of
the
open
road
the
gatherings
at
the
shrines
and
the
infinite
possibilities
of
gossip
with
dowagers
very
often
it
suits
a
longsuffering
family
that
a
old
lady
should
disport
herself
about
india
in
this
fashion
for
certainly
pilgrimage
is
grateful
to
the
gods
so
all
about
india
in
the
most
remote
places
as
in
the
most
public
you
find
some
knot
of
grizzled
servitors
in
nominal
charge
of
an
old
lady
who
is
more
or
less
curtained
and
hid
away
in
a
such
men
are
staid
and
discreet
and
when
a
european
or
a
native
is
near
will
net
their
charge
with
most
elaborate
precautions
but
in
the
ordinary
haphazard
chances
of
pilgrimage
the
precautions
are
not
taken
the
old
lady
is
after
all
intensely
human
and
lives
to
look
upon
life
kim
marked
down
a
gaily
ornamented
ruth
or
family
with
a
broidered
canopy
of
two
domes
like
a
camel
which
had
just
been
drawn
into
the
par
eight
men
made
its
retinue
and
two
of
the
eight
were
armed
with
rusty
sabres
sure
signs
that
they
followed
a
person
of
distinction
for
the
common
folk
do
not
bear
arms
an
increasing
cackle
of
complaints
orders
and
jests
and
what
to
a
european
would
have
been
bad
language
came
from
behind
the
curtains
here
was
evidently
a
woman
used
to
command
kim
looked
over
the
retinue
critically
half
of
them
were
ooryas
from
down
country
the
other
half
were
hillmen
of
the
north
and
that
mixture
told
its
own
tale
even
if
he
had
not
overheard
the
incessant
sparring
between
the
two
divisions
the
old
lady
was
going
south
on
a
visit
probably
to
a
rich
relative
most
probably
to
a
who
had
sent
up
an
escort
as
a
mark
of
respect
the
hillmen
would
be
of
her
own
people
kulu
or
kangra
folk
it
was
quite
clear
that
she
was
not
taking
her
daughter
down
to
be
wedded
or
the
curtains
would
have
been
laced
home
and
the
guard
would
have
allowed
no
one
near
the
car
a
merry
and
a
dame
thought
kim
balancing
the
in
one
hand
the
cooked
food
in
the
other
and
piloting
the
lama
with
a
nudging
shoulder
something
might
be
made
out
of
the
meeting
the
lama
would
give
him
no
help
but
as
a
conscientious
chela
kim
was
delighted
to
beg
for
two
he
built
his
fire
as
close
to
the
cart
as
he
dared
waiting
for
one
of
the
escort
to
order
him
away
the
lama
dropped
wearily
to
the
ground
much
as
a
heavy
bat
cowers
and
returned
to
his
rosary
farther
off
beggar
the
order
was
shouted
in
broken
hindustani
by
one
of
the
hillmen
it
is
only
a
pahari
a
hillman
said
kim
over
his
shoulder
when
have
the
owned
all
hindustan
the
retort
was
a
swift
and
brilliant
sketch
of
kim
pedigree
for
three
generations
kim
voice
was
sweeter
than
ever
as
he
broke
the
into
fit
pieces
my
country
we
call
that
the
beginning
of
a
harsh
thin
cackle
behind
the
curtains
put
the
hillman
on
his
mettle
for
a
second
shot
so
bad
not
so
bad
said
kim
with
calm
have
a
care
my
brother
lest
we
we
i
say
be
minded
to
give
a
curse
or
so
in
return
and
our
curses
have
the
knack
of
biting
home
the
ooryas
laughed
the
hillman
sprang
forward
threateningly
the
lama
suddenly
raised
his
head
bringing
his
huge
hat
into
the
full
light
of
kim
fire
is
it
said
he
the
man
halted
as
though
struck
to
stone
i
am
saved
from
a
great
sin
he
stammered
foreigner
has
found
him
a
priest
at
last
whispered
one
of
the
ooryas
why
is
that
not
well
beaten
the
old
woman
cried
the
hillman
drew
back
to
the
cart
and
whispered
something
to
the
curtain
there
was
dead
silence
then
a
muttering
goes
well
thought
kim
pretending
neither
to
see
nor
hear
when
he
has
eaten
the
hillman
fawned
on
kim
it
is
requested
that
the
holy
one
will
do
the
honour
to
talk
to
one
who
would
speak
to
him
he
has
eaten
he
will
sleep
kim
returned
loftily
he
could
not
quite
see
what
new
turn
the
game
had
taken
but
stood
resolute
to
profit
by
it
i
will
get
him
his
food
the
last
sentence
spoken
loudly
ended
with
a
sigh
as
of
faintness
i
myself
and
the
others
of
my
people
will
look
to
that
if
it
is
permitted
is
permitted
said
kim
more
loftily
than
ever
one
these
people
will
bring
us
food
land
is
good
all
the
country
of
the
south
is
good
a
great
and
a
terrible
world
mumbled
the
lama
drowsily
him
sleep
said
kim
look
to
it
that
we
are
well
fed
when
he
wakes
he
is
a
very
holy
man
again
one
of
the
ooryas
said
something
contemptuously
is
not
a
fakir
he
is
not
a
beggar
kim
went
on
severely
addressing
the
stars
is
the
most
holy
of
holy
men
he
is
above
all
castes
i
am
his
chela
here
said
the
flat
thin
voice
behind
the
curtain
and
kim
came
conscious
that
eyes
he
could
not
see
were
staring
at
him
one
skinny
brown
finger
heavy
with
rings
lay
on
the
edge
of
the
cart
and
the
talk
went
this
way
is
that
one
exceedingly
holy
one
he
comes
from
far
off
he
comes
from
tibet
in
tibet
behind
the
snows
from
a
very
far
place
he
knows
the
stars
he
makes
horoscopes
he
reads
nativities
but
he
does
not
do
this
for
money
he
does
it
for
kindness
and
great
charity
i
am
his
disciple
i
am
called
also
the
friend
of
the
stars
art
no
hillman
him
he
will
tell
thee
i
was
sent
to
him
from
the
stars
to
show
him
an
end
to
his
pilgrimage
consider
brat
that
i
am
an
old
woman
and
not
altogether
a
fool
lamas
i
know
and
to
these
i
give
reverence
but
thou
art
no
more
a
lawful
chela
than
this
my
finger
is
the
pole
of
this
wagon
thou
art
a
casteless
hindu
a
bold
and
unblushing
beggar
attached
belike
to
the
holy
one
for
the
sake
of
gain
we
not
all
work
for
gain
kim
changed
his
tone
promptly
to
match
that
altered
voice
have
heard
this
was
a
bow
drawn
at
a
venture
have
heard
hast
thou
heard
she
snapped
rapping
with
the
finger
that
i
well
remember
but
some
talk
in
the
bazars
which
is
doubtless
a
lie
that
even
rajahs
small
hill
rajahs
none
the
less
of
good
rajput
blood
of
good
blood
that
these
even
sell
the
more
comely
of
their
womenfolk
for
gain
down
south
they
sell
them
to
zemindars
and
such
all
of
oudh
if
there
be
one
thing
in
the
world
that
the
small
hill
rajahs
deny
it
is
just
this
charge
but
it
happens
to
be
one
thing
that
the
bazars
believe
when
they
discuss
the
mysterious
of
india
the
old
lady
explained
to
kim
in
a
tense
indignant
whisper
precisely
what
manner
and
fashion
of
malignant
liar
he
was
had
kim
hinted
this
when
she
was
a
girl
he
would
have
been
pommelled
to
death
that
same
evening
by
an
elephant
this
was
perfectly
true
i
am
only
a
beggar
brat
as
the
eye
of
beauty
has
said
he
wailed
in
extravagant
terror
of
beauty
forsooth
who
am
i
that
thou
shouldst
fling
at
me
and
yet
she
laughed
at
the
word
years
ago
that
might
have
been
said
and
not
without
truth
ay
thirty
years
ago
but
it
is
the
fault
of
this
gadding
up
and
down
hind
that
a
king
widow
must
jostle
all
the
scum
of
the
land
and
be
made
a
mock
by
beggars
queen
said
kim
promptly
for
he
heard
her
shaking
with
indignation
am
even
what
the
great
queen
says
i
am
but
none
the
less
is
my
master
holy
he
has
not
yet
heard
the
great
queen
order
that
i
order
a
holy
one
a
teacher
of
the
law
to
come
and
speak
to
a
woman
never
my
stupidity
i
thought
it
was
given
as
an
order
was
not
it
was
a
petition
does
this
make
all
clear
a
silver
coin
clicked
on
the
edge
of
the
cart
kim
took
it
and
salaamed
profoundly
the
old
lady
recognized
that
as
the
eyes
and
the
ears
of
the
lama
he
was
to
be
propitiated
am
but
the
holy
one
disciple
when
he
has
eaten
perhaps
he
will
come
villain
and
shameless
rogue
the
jewelled
forefinger
shook
itself
at
him
reprovingly
but
he
could
hear
the
old
lady
chuckle
what
is
it
he
said
dropping
into
his
most
caressing
and
confidential
tone
the
one
he
well
knew
that
few
could
resist
is
there
any
need
of
a
son
in
thy
family
speak
freely
for
we
priests
that
last
was
a
direct
plagiarism
from
a
fakir
by
the
taksali
gate
priests
thou
art
not
yet
old
enough
to
she
checked
the
joke
with
another
laugh
me
now
and
again
we
women
o
priest
think
of
other
matters
than
sons
moreover
my
daughter
has
borne
her
arrows
in
the
quiver
are
better
than
one
and
three
are
better
still
kim
quoted
the
proverb
with
a
meditative
cough
looking
discreetly
earthward
oh
true
but
perhaps
that
will
come
certainly
those
brahmins
are
utterly
useless
i
sent
gifts
and
monies
and
gifts
again
to
them
and
they
prophesied
drawled
kim
with
infinite
contempt
prophesied
a
professional
could
have
done
no
better
it
was
not
till
i
remembered
my
own
gods
that
my
prayers
were
heard
i
chose
an
auspicious
hour
and
perhaps
thy
holy
one
has
heard
of
the
abbot
of
the
lamassery
it
was
to
him
i
put
the
matter
and
behold
in
the
due
time
all
came
about
as
i
desired
the
brahmin
in
the
house
of
the
father
of
my
daughter
son
has
since
said
that
it
was
through
his
prayers
which
is
a
little
error
that
i
will
explain
to
him
when
we
reach
our
journey
end
and
so
afterwards
i
go
to
buddh
gaya
to
make
shraddha
for
the
father
of
my
children
go
we
auspicious
chirruped
the
old
lady
second
son
at
least
friend
of
all
the
world
the
lama
had
waked
and
simply
as
a
child
bewildered
in
a
strange
bed
called
for
kim
come
i
come
holy
one
he
dashed
to
the
fire
where
he
found
the
lama
already
surrounded
by
dishes
of
food
the
hillmen
visibly
adoring
him
and
the
southerners
looking
sourly
back
withdraw
kim
cried
we
eat
publicly
like
dogs
they
finished
the
meal
in
silence
each
turned
a
little
from
the
other
and
kim
topped
it
with
a
cigarette
i
not
said
an
hundred
times
that
the
south
is
a
good
land
here
is
a
virtuous
and
widow
of
a
hill
rajah
on
pilgrimage
she
says
to
buddha
gay
she
it
is
sends
us
those
dishes
and
when
thou
art
well
rested
she
would
speak
to
thee
this
also
thy
work
the
lama
dipped
deep
into
his
else
watched
over
thee
since
our
wonderful
journey
began
eyes
danced
in
his
head
as
he
blew
the
rank
smoke
through
his
nostrils
and
stretched
him
on
the
dusty
ground
i
failed
to
oversee
thy
comforts
holy
one
blessing
on
thee
the
lama
inclined
his
solemn
head
have
known
many
men
in
my
so
long
life
and
disciples
not
a
few
but
to
none
among
men
if
so
be
thou
art
has
my
heart
gone
out
as
it
has
to
thee
thoughtful
wise
and
courteous
but
something
of
a
small
imp
i
have
never
seen
such
a
priest
as
thou
kim
considered
the
benevolent
yellow
face
wrinkle
by
wrinkle
is
less
than
three
days
since
we
took
the
road
together
and
it
is
as
though
it
were
a
hundred
years
in
a
former
life
it
was
permitted
that
i
should
have
rendered
thee
some
service
maybe
he
smiled
freed
thee
from
a
trap
or
having
caught
thee
on
a
hook
in
the
days
when
i
was
not
enlightened
cast
thee
back
into
the
river
said
kim
quietly
he
had
heard
this
sort
of
speculation
again
and
again
from
the
mouths
of
many
whom
the
english
would
not
consider
imaginative
as
regards
that
woman
in
the
i
think
she
needs
a
second
son
for
her
daughter
is
no
part
of
the
way
sighed
the
lama
at
least
she
is
from
the
hills
ah
the
hills
and
the
snow
of
the
hills
he
rose
and
stalked
to
the
cart
kim
would
have
given
his
ears
to
come
too
but
the
lama
did
not
invite
him
and
the
few
words
he
caught
were
in
an
unknown
tongue
for
they
spoke
some
common
speech
of
the
mountains
the
woman
seemed
to
ask
questions
which
the
lama
turned
over
in
his
mind
before
answering
now
and
again
he
heard
the
singsong
cadence
of
a
chinese
quotation
it
was
a
strange
picture
that
kim
watched
between
drooped
eyelids
the
lama
very
straight
and
erect
the
deep
folds
of
his
yellow
clothing
slashed
with
black
in
the
light
of
the
parao
fires
precisely
as
a
knotted
is
slashed
with
the
shadows
of
the
low
sun
addressed
a
tinsel
and
lacquered
ruth
which
burned
like
a
jewel
in
the
same
uncertain
light
the
patterns
on
the
curtains
ran
up
and
down
melting
and
reforming
as
the
folds
shook
and
quivered
to
the
night
wind
and
when
the
talk
grew
more
earnest
the
jewelled
forefinger
snapped
out
little
sparks
of
light
between
the
embroideries
behind
the
cart
was
a
wall
of
uncertain
darkness
speckled
with
little
flames
and
alive
with
forms
and
faces
and
shadows
the
voices
of
early
evening
had
settled
down
to
one
soothing
hum
whose
deepest
note
was
the
steady
chumping
of
the
bullocks
above
their
chopped
straw
and
whose
highest
was
the
tinkle
of
a
bengali
sitar
most
men
had
eaten
and
pulled
deep
at
their
gurgling
grunting
hookahs
which
in
full
blast
sound
like
at
last
the
lama
returned
a
hillman
walked
behind
him
with
a
wadded
and
spread
it
carefully
by
the
fire
deserves
ten
thousand
grandchildren
thought
kim
the
less
but
for
me
those
gifts
would
not
have
come
virtuous
woman
and
a
wise
one
the
lama
slackened
off
joint
by
joint
like
a
slow
camel
world
is
full
of
charity
to
those
who
follow
the
way
he
flung
a
fair
half
of
the
quilt
over
kim
what
said
she
kim
rolled
up
in
his
share
of
it
asked
me
many
questions
and
propounded
many
problems
the
most
of
which
were
idle
tales
which
she
had
heard
from
priests
who
pretend
to
follow
the
way
some
i
answered
and
some
i
said
were
foolish
many
wear
the
robe
but
few
keep
the
way
that
is
true
kim
used
the
thoughtful
conciliatory
tone
of
those
who
wish
to
draw
confidences
by
her
lights
she
is
most
she
desires
greatly
that
we
should
go
with
her
to
buddh
gaya
her
road
being
ours
as
i
understand
for
many
days
journey
to
the
southward
a
little
to
this
i
said
that
my
search
came
before
all
things
she
had
heard
many
foolish
legends
but
this
great
truth
of
my
river
she
had
never
heard
such
are
the
priests
of
the
lower
hills
she
knew
the
abbot
of
but
she
did
not
know
of
my
river
nor
the
tale
of
the
arrow
spoke
therefore
of
the
search
and
of
the
way
and
of
matters
that
were
profitable
she
desiring
only
that
i
should
accompany
her
and
make
prayer
for
a
second
son
we
women
do
not
think
of
anything
save
children
said
kim
sleepily
since
our
roads
run
together
for
a
while
i
do
not
see
that
we
in
any
way
depart
from
our
search
if
so
be
we
accompany
her
at
least
as
far
as
i
have
forgotten
the
name
of
the
city
said
kim
turning
and
speaking
in
a
sharp
whisper
to
one
of
the
ooryas
a
few
yards
away
is
your
master
house
little
behind
saharunpore
among
the
fruit
gardens
he
named
the
village
was
the
place
said
the
lama
far
at
least
we
can
go
with
her
go
to
carrion
said
the
oorya
in
an
abstracted
voice
the
sick
cow
a
crow
for
the
sick
man
a
brahmin
kim
breathed
the
proverb
impersonally
to
the
of
the
trees
overhead
the
oorya
grunted
and
held
his
peace
then
we
go
with
her
holy
one
there
any
reason
against
i
can
still
step
aside
and
try
all
the
rivers
that
the
road
overpasses
she
desires
that
i
should
come
she
very
greatly
desires
it
kim
stifled
a
laugh
in
the
quilt
when
once
that
imperious
old
lady
had
recovered
from
her
natural
awe
of
a
lama
he
thought
it
probable
that
she
would
be
worth
listening
to
he
was
nearly
asleep
when
the
lama
suddenly
quoted
a
proverb
husbands
of
the
talkative
have
a
great
reward
hereafter
then
kim
heard
him
snuff
thrice
and
dozed
off
still
laughing
the
dawn
woke
men
and
crows
and
bullocks
together
kim
sat
up
and
yawned
shook
himself
and
thrilled
with
delight
this
was
seeing
the
world
in
real
truth
this
was
life
as
he
would
have
it
bustling
and
shouting
the
buckling
of
belts
and
beating
of
bullocks
and
creaking
of
wheels
lighting
of
fires
and
cooking
of
food
and
new
sights
at
every
turn
of
the
approving
eye
the
morning
mist
swept
off
in
a
whorl
of
silver
the
parrots
shot
away
to
some
distant
river
in
shrieking
green
hosts
all
the
within
went
to
work
india
was
awake
and
kim
was
in
the
middle
of
it
more
awake
and
more
excited
than
anyone
chewing
on
a
twig
that
he
would
presently
use
as
a
toothbrush
for
he
borrowed
and
from
all
the
customs
of
the
country
he
knew
and
loved
there
was
no
need
to
worry
about
food
no
need
to
spend
a
cowrie
at
the
crowded
stalls
he
was
the
disciple
of
a
holy
man
annexed
by
a
old
lady
all
things
would
be
prepared
for
them
and
when
they
were
respectfully
invited
so
to
do
they
would
sit
and
eat
for
the
rest
kim
giggled
here
as
he
cleaned
his
teeth
his
hostess
would
rather
heighten
the
enjoyment
of
the
road
he
inspected
her
bullocks
critically
as
they
came
up
grunting
and
blowing
under
the
yokes
if
they
went
too
fast
it
was
not
likely
there
would
be
a
pleasant
seat
for
himself
along
the
pole
the
lama
would
sit
beside
the
driver
the
escort
of
course
would
walk
the
old
lady
equally
of
course
would
talk
a
great
deal
and
by
what
he
had
heard
that
conversation
would
not
lack
salt
she
was
already
ordering
haranguing
rebuking
and
it
must
be
said
cursing
her
servants
for
delays
her
her
pipe
in
the
name
of
the
gods
get
her
her
pipe
and
stop
her
mouth
cried
an
oorya
tying
up
his
shapeless
bundles
of
bedding
and
the
parrots
are
alike
they
screech
in
the
dawn
hai
look
to
the
they
were
backing
and
wheeling
as
a
axle
caught
them
by
the
horns
of
an
owl
where
dost
thou
go
this
to
the
grinning
carter
yai
yai
that
within
there
is
the
queen
of
delhi
going
to
pray
for
a
son
the
man
called
back
over
his
high
load
for
the
queen
of
delhi
and
her
prime
minister
the
grey
monkey
climbing
up
his
own
sword
another
cart
loaded
with
bark
for
a
tannery
followed
close
behind
and
its
driver
added
a
few
compliments
as
the
backed
and
backed
again
from
behind
the
shaking
curtains
came
one
volley
of
invective
it
did
not
last
long
but
in
kind
and
quality
in
blistering
biting
appropriateness
it
was
beyond
anything
that
even
kim
had
heard
he
could
see
the
carter
bare
chest
collapse
with
amazement
as
the
man
salaamed
reverently
to
the
voice
leaped
from
the
pole
and
helped
the
escort
haul
their
volcano
on
to
the
main
road
here
the
voice
told
him
truthfully
what
sort
of
wife
he
had
wedded
and
what
she
was
doing
in
his
absence
shabash
murmured
kim
unable
to
contain
himself
as
the
man
slunk
away
done
indeed
it
is
a
shame
and
a
scandal
that
a
poor
woman
may
not
go
to
make
prayer
to
her
gods
except
she
be
jostled
and
insulted
by
all
the
refuse
of
hindustan
that
she
must
eat
gali
abuse
as
men
eat
ghi
but
i
have
yet
a
wag
left
to
my
tongue
a
word
or
two
well
spoken
that
serves
the
occasion
and
still
am
i
without
my
tobacco
who
is
the
and
luckless
son
of
shame
that
has
not
yet
prepared
my
pipe
it
was
hastily
thrust
in
by
a
hillman
and
a
trickle
of
thick
smoke
from
each
corner
of
the
curtains
showed
that
peace
was
restored
if
kim
had
walked
proudly
the
day
before
disciple
of
a
holy
man
today
he
paced
with
tenfold
pride
in
the
train
of
a
procession
with
a
recognized
place
under
the
patronage
of
an
old
lady
of
charming
manners
and
infinite
resource
the
escort
their
heads
tied
up
fell
in
on
either
side
the
cart
shuffling
enormous
clouds
of
dust
the
lama
and
kim
walked
a
little
to
one
side
kim
chewing
his
stick
of
sugarcane
and
making
way
for
no
one
under
the
status
of
a
priest
they
could
hear
the
old
lady
tongue
clack
as
steadily
as
a
she
bade
the
escort
tell
her
what
was
going
on
on
the
road
and
so
soon
as
they
were
clear
of
the
parao
she
flung
back
the
curtains
and
peered
out
her
veil
a
third
across
her
face
her
men
did
not
eye
her
directly
when
she
addressed
them
and
thus
the
proprieties
were
more
or
less
observed
a
dark
sallowish
district
superintendent
of
police
faultlessly
uniformed
an
englishman
trotted
by
on
a
tired
horse
and
seeing
from
her
retinue
what
manner
of
person
she
was
chaffed
her
mother
he
cried
they
do
this
in
the
zenanas
suppose
an
englishman
came
by
and
saw
that
thou
hast
no
nose
she
shrilled
back
own
mother
has
no
nose
why
say
so
then
on
the
open
road
it
was
a
fair
counter
the
englishman
threw
up
his
hand
with
the
gesture
of
a
man
hit
at
she
laughed
and
nodded
this
a
face
to
tempt
virtue
aside
she
withdrew
all
her
veil
and
stared
at
him
it
was
by
no
means
lovely
but
as
the
man
gathered
up
his
reins
he
called
it
a
moon
of
paradise
a
disturber
of
integrity
and
a
few
other
fantastic
epithets
which
doubled
her
up
with
mirth
is
a
rogue
she
said
are
but
the
are
the
worst
hai
my
son
thou
hast
never
learned
all
that
since
thou
camest
from
belait
europe
who
suckled
thee
pahareen
a
hillwoman
of
dalhousie
my
mother
keep
thy
beauty
under
a
shade
o
dispenser
of
delights
and
he
was
gone
be
the
sort
she
took
a
fine
judicial
tone
and
stuffed
her
mouth
with
pan
be
the
sort
to
oversee
justice
they
know
the
land
and
the
customs
of
the
land
the
others
all
new
from
europe
suckled
by
white
women
and
learning
our
tongues
from
books
are
worse
than
the
pestilence
they
do
harm
to
kings
then
she
told
a
long
long
tale
to
the
world
at
large
of
an
ignorant
young
policeman
who
had
disturbed
some
small
hill
rajah
a
ninth
cousin
of
her
own
in
the
matter
of
a
trivial
winding
up
with
a
quotation
from
a
work
by
no
means
devotional
then
her
mood
changed
and
she
bade
one
of
the
escort
ask
whether
the
lama
would
walk
alongside
and
discuss
matters
of
religion
so
kim
dropped
back
into
the
dust
and
returned
to
his
for
an
hour
or
more
the
lama
showed
like
a
moon
through
the
haze
and
from
all
he
heard
kim
gathered
that
the
old
woman
wept
one
of
the
ooryas
half
apologized
for
his
rudeness
overnight
saying
that
he
had
never
known
his
mistress
of
so
bland
a
temper
and
he
ascribed
it
to
the
presence
of
the
strange
priest
personally
he
believed
in
brahmins
though
like
all
natives
he
was
acutely
aware
of
their
cunning
and
their
greed
still
when
brahmins
but
irritated
with
begging
demands
the
mother
of
his
master
wife
and
when
she
sent
them
away
so
angry
that
they
cursed
the
whole
retinue
which
was
the
real
reason
of
the
second
bullock
going
lame
and
of
the
pole
breaking
the
night
before
he
was
prepared
to
accept
any
priest
of
any
other
denomination
in
or
out
of
india
to
this
kim
assented
with
wise
nods
and
bade
the
oorya
observe
that
the
lama
took
no
money
and
that
the
cost
of
his
and
kim
food
would
be
repaid
a
hundred
times
in
the
good
luck
that
would
attend
the
caravan
henceforward
he
also
told
stories
of
lahore
city
and
sang
a
song
or
two
which
made
the
escort
laugh
as
a
well
acquainted
with
the
latest
songs
by
the
most
fashionable
composers
they
are
women
for
the
most
part
kim
had
a
distinct
advantage
over
men
from
a
little
behind
saharunpore
but
he
let
that
advantage
be
inferred
at
noon
they
turned
aside
to
eat
and
the
meal
was
good
plentiful
and
on
plates
of
clean
leaves
in
decency
out
of
drift
of
the
dust
they
gave
the
scraps
to
certain
beggars
that
all
requirements
might
be
fulfilled
and
sat
down
to
a
long
luxurious
smoke
the
old
lady
had
retreated
behind
her
curtains
but
mixed
most
freely
in
the
talk
her
servants
arguing
with
and
contradicting
her
as
servants
do
throughout
the
east
she
compared
the
cool
and
the
pines
of
the
kangra
and
kulu
hills
with
the
dust
and
the
mangoes
of
the
south
she
told
a
tale
of
some
old
local
gods
at
the
edge
of
her
husband
territory
she
roundly
abused
the
tobacco
which
she
was
then
smoking
reviled
all
brahmins
and
speculated
without
reserve
on
the
coming
of
many
grandsons
chapter
here
come
i
to
my
own
again
fed
forgiven
and
known
again
claimed
by
bone
of
my
bone
again
and
sib
to
flesh
of
my
flesh
the
fatted
calf
is
dressed
for
me
but
the
husks
have
greater
zest
for
me
i
think
my
pigs
will
be
best
for
me
so
i
off
to
the
styes
afresh
the
prodigal
son
once
more
the
lazy
shuffling
procession
got
under
way
and
she
slept
till
they
reached
the
next
it
was
a
very
short
march
and
time
lacked
an
hour
to
sundown
so
kim
cast
about
for
means
of
amusement
why
not
sit
and
rest
said
one
of
the
escort
the
devils
and
the
english
walk
to
and
fro
without
reason
make
friends
with
the
devil
a
monkey
or
a
boy
no
man
knows
what
they
will
do
next
said
his
fellow
kim
turned
a
scornful
back
he
did
not
want
to
hear
the
old
story
how
the
devil
played
with
the
boys
and
repented
of
it
and
walked
idly
across
country
the
lama
strode
after
him
all
that
day
whenever
they
passed
a
stream
he
had
turned
aside
to
look
at
it
but
in
no
case
had
he
received
any
warning
that
he
had
found
his
river
insensibly
too
the
comfort
of
speaking
to
someone
in
a
reasonable
tongue
and
of
being
properly
considered
and
respected
as
her
spiritual
adviser
by
a
woman
had
weaned
his
thoughts
a
little
from
the
search
and
further
he
was
prepared
to
spend
serene
years
in
his
quest
having
nothing
of
the
white
man
impatience
but
a
great
faith
goest
thou
he
called
after
kim
it
was
a
small
march
and
all
this
kim
waved
his
hands
abroad
new
to
me
is
beyond
question
a
wise
and
a
discerning
woman
but
it
is
hard
to
meditate
when
women
are
thus
kim
spoke
as
might
have
solomon
the
lamassery
was
a
broad
platform
the
lama
muttered
looping
up
the
rosary
stone
on
that
i
have
left
the
marks
of
my
feet
pacing
to
and
fro
with
these
he
clicked
the
beads
and
began
the
mane
pudme
hum
of
his
devotion
grateful
for
the
cool
the
quiet
and
the
absence
of
dust
one
thing
after
another
drew
kim
idle
eye
across
the
plain
there
was
no
purpose
in
his
wanderings
except
that
the
build
of
the
huts
near
by
seemed
new
and
he
wished
to
investigate
they
came
out
on
a
broad
tract
of
brown
and
purple
in
the
afternoon
light
with
a
heavy
clump
of
mangoes
in
the
centre
it
struck
kim
as
curious
that
no
shrine
stood
in
so
eligible
a
spot
the
boy
was
observing
as
any
priest
for
these
things
far
across
the
plain
walked
side
by
side
four
men
made
small
by
the
distance
he
looked
intently
under
his
curved
palms
and
caught
the
sheen
of
brass
white
soldiers
said
he
us
see
is
always
soldiers
when
thou
and
i
go
out
alone
together
but
i
have
never
seen
the
white
soldiers
do
no
harm
except
when
they
are
drunk
keep
behind
this
tree
they
stepped
behind
the
thick
trunks
in
the
cool
dark
of
the
two
little
figures
halted
the
other
two
came
forward
uncertainly
they
were
the
of
a
regiment
on
the
march
sent
out
as
usual
to
mark
the
camp
they
bore
sticks
with
fluttering
flags
and
called
to
each
other
as
they
spread
over
the
flat
earth
at
last
they
entered
the
walking
heavily
here
or
hereabouts
officers
tents
under
the
trees
i
take
it
an
the
rest
of
us
can
stay
outside
have
they
marked
out
for
the
behind
they
cried
again
to
their
comrades
in
the
distance
and
the
rough
answer
came
back
faint
and
mellowed
the
flag
in
here
then
said
one
do
they
prepare
said
the
lama
wonderstruck
is
a
great
and
terrible
world
what
is
the
device
on
the
flag
a
soldier
thrust
a
stave
within
a
few
feet
of
them
grunted
discontentedly
pulled
it
up
again
conferred
with
his
companion
who
looked
up
and
down
the
shaded
cave
of
greenery
and
returned
it
kim
stared
with
all
his
eyes
his
breath
coming
short
and
sharp
between
his
teeth
the
soldiers
stamped
off
into
the
sunshine
holy
one
he
gasped
horoscope
the
drawing
in
the
dust
by
the
priest
at
umballa
remember
what
he
said
first
come
two
ferashes
to
make
all
things
ready
in
a
dark
place
as
it
is
always
at
the
beginning
of
a
vision
this
is
not
vision
said
the
lama
is
the
world
illusion
and
no
more
after
them
comes
the
bull
the
red
bull
on
the
green
field
look
it
is
he
he
pointed
to
the
flag
that
was
snap
snapping
in
the
evening
breeze
not
ten
feet
away
it
was
no
more
than
an
ordinary
camp
but
the
regiment
always
punctilious
in
matters
of
millinery
had
charged
it
with
the
regimental
device
the
red
bull
which
is
the
crest
of
the
mavericks
the
great
red
bull
on
a
background
of
irish
green
see
and
now
i
remember
said
the
lama
it
is
thy
bull
certainly
also
the
two
men
came
to
make
all
ready
are
soldiers
white
soldiers
what
said
the
priest
the
sign
over
against
the
bull
is
the
sign
of
war
and
armed
men
holy
one
this
thing
touches
my
search
it
is
true
the
lama
stared
fixedly
at
the
device
that
flamed
like
a
ruby
in
the
dusk
priest
at
umballa
said
that
thine
was
the
sign
of
war
is
to
do
now
let
us
wait
now
the
darkness
clears
said
kim
it
was
only
natural
that
the
descending
sun
should
at
last
strike
through
the
across
the
grove
filling
it
with
mealy
gold
light
for
a
few
minutes
but
to
kim
it
was
the
crown
of
the
umballa
brahmin
prophecy
said
the
lama
beats
a
drum
far
off
at
first
the
sound
carrying
diluted
through
the
still
air
resembled
the
beating
of
an
artery
in
the
head
soon
a
sharpness
was
added
the
music
kim
explained
he
knew
the
sound
of
a
regimental
band
but
it
amazed
the
lama
at
the
far
end
of
the
plain
a
heavy
dusty
column
crawled
in
sight
then
the
wind
brought
the
tune
we
crave
your
condescension
to
tell
you
what
we
know
of
marching
in
the
mulligan
guards
to
sligo
port
below
here
broke
in
the
fifes
we
shouldered
arms
we
marched
we
marched
away
from
phoenix
park
we
marched
to
dublin
bay
the
drums
and
the
fifes
oh
sweetly
they
did
play
as
we
marched
marched
marched
with
the
mulligan
guards
it
was
the
band
of
the
mavericks
playing
the
regiment
to
camp
for
the
men
were
with
their
baggage
the
rippling
column
swung
into
the
level
carts
behind
it
divided
left
and
right
ran
about
like
an
and
this
is
sorcery
said
the
lama
the
plain
dotted
itself
with
tents
that
seemed
to
rise
all
spread
from
the
carts
another
rush
of
men
invaded
the
grove
pitched
a
huge
tent
in
silence
ran
up
yet
eight
or
nine
more
by
the
side
of
it
unearthed
pans
and
bundles
which
were
taken
possession
of
by
a
crowd
of
native
servants
and
behold
the
turned
into
an
orderly
town
as
they
watched
us
go
said
the
lama
sinking
back
afraid
as
the
fires
twinkled
and
white
officers
with
jingling
swords
stalked
into
the
back
in
the
shadow
no
one
can
see
beyond
the
light
of
a
fire
said
kim
his
eyes
still
on
the
flag
he
had
never
before
watched
the
routine
of
a
seasoned
regiment
pitching
camp
in
thirty
minutes
look
look
clucked
the
lama
comes
a
priest
it
was
bennett
the
church
of
england
chaplain
of
the
regiment
limping
in
dusty
black
one
of
his
flock
had
made
some
rude
remarks
about
the
chaplain
mettle
and
to
abash
him
bennett
had
marched
step
by
step
with
the
men
that
day
the
black
dress
gold
cross
on
the
the
hairless
face
and
the
soft
black
wideawake
hat
would
have
marked
him
as
a
holy
man
anywhere
in
all
india
he
dropped
into
a
by
the
door
of
the
and
slid
off
his
boots
three
or
four
officers
gathered
round
him
laughing
and
joking
over
his
exploit
talk
of
white
men
is
wholly
lacking
in
dignity
said
the
lama
who
judged
only
by
tone
i
considered
the
countenance
of
that
priest
and
i
think
he
is
learned
is
it
likely
that
he
will
understand
our
talk
i
would
talk
to
him
of
my
search
speak
to
a
white
man
till
he
is
fed
said
kim
quoting
a
proverb
will
eat
now
and
and
i
do
not
think
they
are
good
to
beg
from
let
us
go
back
to
the
after
we
have
eaten
we
will
come
again
it
certainly
was
a
red
bull
my
red
bull
they
were
both
noticeably
when
the
old
lady
retinue
set
their
meal
before
them
so
none
broke
their
reserve
for
it
is
not
lucky
to
annoy
guests
said
kim
picking
his
teeth
will
return
to
that
place
but
thou
o
holy
one
must
wait
a
little
way
off
because
thy
feet
are
heavier
than
mine
and
i
am
anxious
to
see
more
of
that
red
bull
how
canst
thou
understand
the
talk
walk
slowly
the
road
is
dark
the
lama
replied
uneasily
kim
put
the
question
aside
marked
a
place
near
to
the
trees
said
he
thou
canst
sit
till
i
call
nay
as
the
lama
made
some
sort
of
protest
this
is
my
search
the
search
for
my
red
bull
the
sign
in
the
stars
was
not
for
thee
i
know
a
little
of
the
customs
of
white
soldiers
and
i
always
desire
to
see
some
new
things
dost
thou
not
know
of
this
world
the
lama
squatted
obediently
in
a
little
hollow
of
the
ground
not
a
hundred
yards
from
the
hump
of
the
dark
against
the
sky
till
i
call
kim
flitted
into
the
dusk
he
knew
that
in
all
probability
there
would
be
sentries
round
the
camp
and
smiled
to
himself
as
he
heard
the
thick
boots
of
one
a
boy
who
can
dodge
over
the
roofs
of
lahore
city
on
a
moonlight
night
using
every
little
patch
and
corner
of
darkness
to
discomfit
his
pursuer
is
not
likely
to
be
checked
by
a
line
of
soldiers
he
paid
them
the
compliment
of
crawling
between
a
couple
and
running
and
halting
crouching
and
dropping
flat
worked
his
way
toward
the
lighted
where
close
pressed
behind
the
he
waited
till
some
chance
word
should
give
him
a
returnable
lead
the
one
thing
now
in
his
mind
was
further
information
as
to
the
red
bull
for
aught
he
knew
and
kim
limitations
were
as
curious
and
sudden
as
his
expansions
the
men
the
nine
hundred
thorough
devils
of
his
father
prophecy
might
pray
to
the
beast
after
dark
as
hindus
pray
to
the
holy
cow
that
at
least
would
be
entirely
right
and
logical
and
the
padre
with
the
gold
cross
would
be
therefore
the
man
to
consult
in
the
matter
on
the
other
hand
remembering
padres
whom
he
had
avoided
in
lahore
city
the
priest
might
be
an
inquisitive
nuisance
who
would
bid
him
learn
but
had
it
not
been
proven
at
umballa
that
his
sign
in
the
high
heavens
portended
war
and
armed
men
was
he
not
the
friend
of
the
stars
as
well
as
of
all
the
world
crammed
to
the
teeth
with
dreadful
secrets
lastly
and
firstly
as
the
undercurrent
of
all
his
quick
thoughts
this
adventure
though
he
did
not
know
the
english
word
was
a
stupendous
lark
a
delightful
continuation
of
his
old
flights
across
the
housetops
as
well
as
the
fulfilment
of
sublime
prophecy
he
lay
and
wriggled
towards
the
door
a
hand
on
the
amulet
round
his
neck
it
was
as
he
suspected
the
sahibs
prayed
to
their
god
for
in
the
centre
of
the
its
sole
ornament
when
they
were
on
the
line
of
march
stood
a
golden
bull
fashioned
from
loot
of
the
summer
palace
at
pekin
a
bull
with
lowered
head
ramping
upon
a
field
of
irish
green
to
him
the
sahibs
held
out
their
glasses
and
cried
aloud
confusedly
now
the
reverend
arthur
bennett
always
left
mess
after
that
toast
and
being
rather
tired
by
his
march
his
movements
were
more
abrupt
than
usual
kim
with
slightly
raised
head
was
still
staring
at
his
totem
on
the
table
when
the
chaplain
stepped
on
his
right
kim
flinched
under
the
leather
and
rolling
sideways
brought
down
the
chaplain
who
ever
a
man
of
action
caught
him
by
the
throat
and
nearly
choked
the
life
out
of
him
kim
then
kicked
him
desperately
in
the
stomach
mr
bennett
gasped
and
doubled
up
but
without
relaxing
his
grip
rolled
over
again
and
silently
hauled
kim
to
his
own
tent
the
mavericks
were
incurable
practical
jokers
and
it
occurred
to
the
englishman
that
silence
was
best
till
he
had
made
complete
inquiry
it
a
boy
he
said
as
he
drew
his
prize
under
the
light
of
the
lantern
then
shaking
him
severely
cried
were
you
doing
you
a
thief
choor
mallum
his
hindustani
was
very
limited
and
the
ruffled
and
disgusted
kim
intended
to
keep
to
the
character
laid
down
for
him
as
he
recovered
his
breath
he
was
inventing
a
beautifully
plausible
tale
of
his
relations
to
some
scullion
and
at
the
same
time
keeping
a
keen
eye
on
and
a
little
under
the
chaplain
left
the
chance
came
he
ducked
for
the
doorway
but
a
long
arm
shot
out
and
clutched
at
his
neck
snapping
the
and
closing
on
the
amulet
it
me
o
give
it
me
is
it
lost
give
me
the
papers
the
words
were
in
english
the
tinny
english
of
the
and
the
chaplain
jumped
scapular
said
he
opening
his
hand
some
sort
of
heathen
charm
why
why
do
you
speak
english
little
boys
who
steal
are
beaten
you
know
that
do
not
i
did
not
steal
kim
danced
in
agony
like
a
terrier
at
a
lifted
stick
give
it
me
it
is
my
charm
do
not
thieve
it
from
me
the
chaplain
took
no
heed
but
going
to
the
tent
door
called
aloud
a
fattish
man
appeared
want
your
advice
father
victor
said
bennett
found
this
boy
in
the
dark
outside
the
ordinarily
i
should
have
chastised
him
and
let
him
go
because
i
believe
him
to
be
a
thief
but
it
seems
he
talks
english
and
he
attaches
some
sort
of
value
to
a
charm
round
his
neck
i
thought
perhaps
you
might
help
me
between
himself
and
the
roman
catholic
chaplain
of
the
irish
contingent
lay
as
bennett
believed
an
unbridgeable
gulf
but
it
was
noticeable
that
whenever
the
church
of
england
dealt
with
a
human
problem
she
was
very
likely
to
call
in
the
church
of
rome
bennett
official
abhorrence
of
the
scarlet
woman
and
all
her
ways
was
only
equalled
by
his
private
respect
for
father
victor
thief
talking
english
is
it
let
look
at
his
charm
no
not
a
scapular
bennett
he
held
out
his
hand
have
we
any
right
to
open
it
a
sound
whipping
did
not
thieve
protested
kim
have
hit
me
kicks
all
over
my
body
now
give
me
my
charm
and
i
will
go
away
quite
so
fast
we
look
first
said
father
victor
leisurely
rolling
out
poor
kimball
varietur
parchment
his
and
kim
baptismal
certificate
on
this
last
with
some
confused
idea
that
he
was
doing
wonders
for
his
son
had
scrawled
scores
of
times
after
the
boy
please
look
after
the
boy
signing
his
name
and
regimental
number
in
full
of
darkness
below
said
father
victor
passing
all
over
to
mr
bennett
you
know
what
these
things
are
said
kim
are
mine
and
i
want
to
go
away
do
not
quite
understand
said
mr
bennett
probably
brought
them
on
purpose
it
may
be
a
begging
trick
of
some
kind
never
saw
a
beggar
less
anxious
to
stay
with
his
company
then
there
the
makings
of
a
gay
mystery
here
ye
believe
in
providence
bennett
hope
so
i
believe
in
miracles
so
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
powers
of
darkness
kimball
and
his
son
but
then
he
a
native
and
i
saw
kimball
married
myself
to
annie
shott
how
long
have
you
had
these
things
boy
since
i
was
a
little
baby
father
victor
stepped
forward
quickly
and
opened
the
front
of
upper
garment
see
bennett
he
not
very
black
what
your
name
kimball
will
you
let
me
go
away
else
call
me
kim
rishti
ke
that
is
kim
of
the
rishti
is
that
rishti
that
was
the
regiment
my
father
oh
i
see
that
was
how
my
father
told
me
my
father
he
has
lived
lived
where
lived
of
course
he
is
dead
that
your
abrupt
way
of
putting
it
is
it
bennett
interrupted
is
possible
i
have
done
the
boy
an
injustice
he
is
certainly
white
though
evidently
neglected
i
am
sure
i
must
have
bruised
him
i
do
not
think
spirits
him
a
glass
of
sherry
then
and
let
him
squat
on
the
cot
now
kim
continued
father
victor
one
is
going
to
hurt
you
drink
that
down
and
tell
us
about
yourself
the
truth
if
you
no
objection
kim
coughed
a
little
as
he
put
down
the
empty
glass
and
considered
this
seemed
a
time
for
caution
and
fancy
small
boys
who
prowl
about
camps
are
generally
turned
out
after
a
whipping
but
he
had
received
no
stripes
the
amulet
was
evidently
working
in
his
favour
and
it
looked
as
though
the
umballa
horoscope
and
the
few
words
that
he
could
remember
of
his
father
maunderings
fitted
in
most
miraculously
else
why
did
the
fat
padre
seem
so
impressed
and
why
the
glass
of
hot
yellow
drink
from
the
lean
one
father
he
is
dead
in
lahore
city
since
i
was
very
little
the
woman
she
kept
kabarri
shop
near
where
the
are
kim
began
with
a
plunge
not
quite
sure
how
far
the
truth
would
serve
him
mother
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
went
out
when
i
was
born
my
father
he
got
these
papers
from
the
what
do
you
call
that
bennett
nodded
he
was
in
what
do
you
call
that
again
bennett
nodded
father
told
me
that
he
said
too
and
also
the
brahmin
who
made
the
drawing
in
the
dust
at
umballa
two
days
ago
he
said
that
i
shall
find
a
red
bull
on
a
green
field
and
that
the
bull
shall
help
me
phenomenal
little
liar
muttered
bennett
of
darkness
below
what
a
country
murmured
father
victor
on
kim
did
not
thieve
besides
i
am
just
now
disciple
of
a
very
holy
man
he
is
sitting
outside
we
saw
two
men
come
with
flags
making
the
place
ready
that
is
always
so
in
a
dream
or
on
account
of
a
a
prophecy
so
i
knew
it
was
come
true
i
saw
the
red
bull
on
the
green
field
and
my
father
he
said
nine
hundred
pukka
devils
and
the
colonel
riding
on
a
horse
will
look
after
you
when
you
find
the
red
bull
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
when
i
saw
the
bull
but
i
went
away
and
i
came
again
when
it
was
dark
i
wanted
to
see
the
bull
again
and
i
saw
the
bull
again
with
the
the
sahibs
praying
to
it
i
think
the
bull
shall
help
me
the
holy
man
said
so
too
he
is
sitting
outside
will
you
hurt
him
if
i
call
him
a
shout
now
he
is
very
holy
he
can
witness
to
all
the
things
i
say
and
he
knows
i
am
not
a
thief
sahibs
praying
to
a
bull
what
in
the
world
do
you
make
of
that
said
bennett
of
a
holy
man
is
the
boy
mad
boy
sure
enough
boy
leagued
with
all
the
powers
of
darkness
it
very
much
what
his
father
would
have
done
if
he
was
drunk
we
better
invite
the
holy
man
he
may
know
something
does
not
know
anything
said
kim
will
show
you
him
if
you
come
he
is
my
master
then
afterwards
we
can
go
of
darkness
was
all
that
father
victor
could
say
as
bennett
marched
off
with
a
firm
hand
on
kim
shoulder
they
found
the
lama
where
he
had
dropped
search
is
at
an
end
for
me
shouted
kim
in
the
vernacular
have
found
the
bull
but
god
knows
what
comes
next
they
will
not
hurt
you
come
to
the
fat
priest
tent
with
this
thin
man
and
see
the
end
it
is
all
new
and
they
can
not
talk
hindi
they
are
only
uncurried
donkeys
it
is
not
well
to
make
a
jest
of
their
ignorance
the
lama
returned
am
glad
if
thou
art
rejoiced
chela
dignified
and
unsuspicious
he
strode
into
the
little
tent
saluted
the
churches
as
a
churchman
and
sat
down
by
the
open
charcoal
brazier
the
yellow
lining
of
the
tent
reflected
in
the
lamplight
made
his
face
bennett
looked
at
him
with
the
uninterest
of
the
creed
that
lumps
of
the
world
under
the
title
of
what
was
the
end
of
the
search
what
gift
has
the
red
bull
brought
the
lama
addressed
himself
to
kim
says
what
are
you
going
to
do
bennett
was
staring
uneasily
at
father
victor
and
kim
for
his
own
ends
took
upon
himself
the
office
of
interpreter
do
not
see
what
concern
this
fakir
has
with
the
boy
who
is
probably
his
dupe
or
his
confederate
bennett
began
can
not
allow
an
english
boy
assuming
that
he
is
the
son
of
a
mason
the
sooner
he
goes
to
the
masonic
orphanage
the
better
that
your
opinion
as
secretary
to
the
regimental
lodge
said
father
victor
we
might
as
well
tell
the
old
man
what
we
are
going
to
do
he
does
look
like
a
villain
experience
is
that
one
can
never
fathom
the
oriental
mind
now
kimball
i
wish
you
to
tell
this
man
what
i
say
word
for
word
kim
gathered
the
import
of
the
next
few
sentences
and
began
thus
one
the
thin
fool
who
looks
like
a
camel
says
that
i
am
the
son
of
a
sahib
how
it
is
true
i
knew
it
since
my
birth
but
he
could
only
find
it
out
by
rending
the
amulet
from
my
neck
and
reading
all
the
papers
he
thinks
that
once
a
sahib
is
always
a
sahib
and
between
the
two
of
them
they
purpose
to
keep
me
in
this
regiment
or
to
send
me
to
a
madrissah
a
school
it
has
happened
before
i
have
always
avoided
it
the
fat
fool
is
of
one
mind
and
the
one
of
another
but
that
is
no
odds
i
may
spend
one
night
here
and
perhaps
the
next
it
has
happened
before
then
i
will
run
away
and
return
to
thee
tell
them
that
thou
art
my
chela
tell
them
how
thou
didst
come
to
me
when
i
was
faint
and
bewildered
tell
them
of
our
search
and
they
will
surely
let
thee
go
now
have
already
told
them
they
laugh
and
they
talk
of
the
police
are
you
saying
asked
mr
bennett
he
only
says
that
if
you
do
not
let
me
go
it
will
stop
him
in
his
business
his
private
this
last
was
a
reminiscence
of
some
talk
with
a
eurasian
clerk
in
the
canal
department
but
it
only
drew
a
smile
which
nettled
him
if
you
did
know
what
his
business
was
you
would
not
be
in
such
a
beastly
hurry
to
interfere
is
it
then
said
father
victor
not
without
feeling
as
he
watched
the
lama
face
is
a
river
in
this
country
which
he
wishes
to
find
so
verree
much
it
was
put
out
by
an
arrow
which
kim
tapped
his
foot
impatiently
as
he
translated
in
his
own
mind
from
the
vernacular
to
his
clumsy
english
it
was
made
by
our
lord
god
buddha
you
know
and
if
you
wash
there
you
are
washed
away
from
all
your
sins
and
made
as
white
as
kim
had
heard
in
his
time
am
his
disciple
and
we
must
find
that
river
it
is
so
verree
valuable
to
us
that
again
said
bennett
kim
obeyed
with
amplifications
this
is
gross
blasphemy
cried
the
church
of
england
tck
said
father
victor
sympathetically
give
a
good
deal
to
be
able
to
talk
the
vernacular
a
river
that
washes
away
sin
and
how
long
have
you
two
been
looking
for
it
many
days
now
we
wish
to
go
away
and
look
for
it
again
it
is
not
here
you
see
see
said
father
victor
gravely
he
ca
go
on
in
that
old
man
company
it
would
be
different
kim
if
you
were
not
a
son
tell
him
that
the
regiment
will
take
care
of
you
and
make
you
as
good
a
man
as
your
as
good
a
man
as
can
be
tell
him
that
if
he
believes
in
miracles
he
must
believe
that
is
no
need
to
play
on
his
credulity
bennett
interrupted
doing
no
such
thing
he
must
believe
that
the
boy
coming
here
to
his
own
regiment
in
search
of
his
red
bull
is
in
the
nature
of
a
miracle
consider
the
chances
against
it
bennett
this
one
boy
in
all
india
and
our
regiment
of
all
others
on
the
line
o
march
for
him
to
meet
with
it
predestined
on
the
face
of
it
yes
tell
him
it
kismet
kismet
mallum
do
you
understand
he
turned
towards
the
lama
to
whom
he
might
as
well
have
talked
of
mesopotamia
say
the
old
man
eye
lighted
at
kim
speech
say
that
the
meaning
of
my
horoscope
is
now
accomplished
and
that
being
led
back
though
as
thou
knowest
i
went
out
of
curiosity
to
these
people
and
their
red
bull
i
must
needs
go
to
a
madrissah
and
be
turned
into
a
sahib
now
i
make
pretence
of
agreement
for
at
the
worst
it
will
be
but
a
few
meals
eaten
away
from
thee
then
i
will
slip
away
and
follow
down
the
road
to
saharunpore
therefore
holy
one
keep
with
that
kulu
woman
on
no
account
stray
far
from
her
cart
till
i
come
again
past
question
my
sign
is
of
war
and
of
armed
men
see
how
they
have
given
me
wine
to
drink
and
set
me
upon
a
bed
of
honour
my
father
must
have
been
some
great
person
so
if
they
raise
me
to
honour
among
them
good
if
not
good
again
however
it
goes
i
will
run
back
to
thee
when
i
am
tired
but
stay
with
the
rajputni
or
i
shall
miss
thy
feet
oah
yess
said
the
boy
have
told
him
everything
you
tell
me
to
say
i
can
not
see
any
need
why
he
should
wait
said
bennett
feeling
in
his
can
investigate
the
details
later
and
i
will
give
him
a
ru
him
time
maybe
he
fond
of
the
lad
said
father
victor
half
arresting
the
clergyman
motion
the
lama
dragged
forth
his
rosary
and
pulled
his
huge
over
his
eyes
can
he
want
now
says
kim
put
up
one
hand
says
be
quiet
he
wants
to
speak
to
me
by
himself
you
see
you
do
not
know
one
little
word
of
what
he
says
and
i
think
if
you
talk
he
will
perhaps
give
you
very
bad
curses
when
he
takes
those
beads
like
that
you
see
he
always
wants
to
be
quiet
the
two
englishmen
sat
overwhelmed
but
there
was
a
look
in
eye
that
promised
ill
for
kim
when
he
should
be
relaxed
to
the
religious
arm
sahib
and
the
son
of
a
sahib
the
lama
voice
was
harsh
with
pain
no
white
man
knows
the
land
and
the
customs
of
the
land
as
thou
knowest
how
comes
it
this
is
true
matter
holy
one
but
remember
it
is
only
for
a
night
or
two
remember
i
can
change
swiftly
it
will
all
be
as
it
was
when
i
first
spoke
to
thee
under
the
great
gun
a
boy
in
the
dress
of
white
men
when
i
first
went
to
the
wonder
house
and
a
second
time
thou
wast
a
hindu
what
shall
the
third
incarnation
be
he
chuckled
drearily
chela
thou
has
done
a
wrong
to
an
old
man
because
my
heart
went
out
to
thee
mine
to
thee
but
how
could
i
know
that
the
red
bull
would
bring
me
to
this
business
the
lama
covered
his
face
afresh
and
nervously
rattled
the
rosary
kim
squatted
beside
him
and
laid
hold
upon
a
fold
of
his
clothing
it
is
understood
that
the
boy
is
a
sahib
he
went
on
in
a
muffled
tone
a
sahib
as
was
he
who
kept
the
images
in
the
wonder
house
the
lama
experience
of
white
men
was
limited
he
seemed
to
be
repeating
a
lesson
then
it
is
not
seemly
that
he
should
do
other
than
as
the
sahibs
do
he
must
go
back
to
his
own
people
a
day
and
a
night
and
a
day
kim
pleaded
ye
do
father
victor
saw
kim
edging
towards
the
door
and
interposed
a
strong
leg
do
not
understand
the
customs
of
white
men
the
priest
of
the
images
in
the
wonder
house
in
lahore
was
more
courteous
than
the
thin
one
here
this
boy
will
be
taken
from
me
they
will
make
a
sahib
of
my
disciple
woe
to
me
how
shall
i
find
my
river
have
they
no
disciples
ask
says
he
is
very
sorree
that
he
can
not
find
the
river
now
any
more
he
says
why
have
you
no
disciples
and
stop
bothering
him
he
wants
to
be
washed
of
his
sins
neither
bennett
nor
father
victor
found
any
answer
ready
said
kim
in
english
distressed
for
the
lama
agony
think
if
you
will
let
me
go
now
we
will
walk
away
quietly
and
not
steal
we
will
look
for
that
river
like
before
i
was
caught
i
wish
i
did
not
come
here
to
find
the
red
bull
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
do
not
want
it
the
very
best
day
work
you
ever
did
for
yourself
young
man
said
bennett
heavens
i
do
know
how
to
console
him
said
father
victor
watching
the
lama
intently
ca
take
the
boy
away
with
him
and
yet
he
a
good
man
i
sure
he
a
good
man
bennett
if
you
give
him
that
rupee
he
curse
you
root
and
branch
they
listened
to
each
other
breathing
three
five
full
minutes
then
the
lama
raised
his
head
and
looked
forth
across
them
into
space
and
emptiness
i
am
a
follower
of
the
way
he
said
bitterly
sin
is
mine
and
the
punishment
is
mine
i
made
believe
to
myself
for
now
i
see
it
was
but
that
thou
wast
sent
to
me
to
aid
in
the
search
so
my
heart
went
out
to
thee
for
thy
charity
and
thy
courtesy
and
the
wisdom
of
thy
little
years
but
those
who
follow
the
way
must
permit
not
the
fire
of
any
desire
or
attachment
for
that
is
all
illusion
as
says
he
quoted
an
old
old
chinese
text
backed
it
with
another
and
reinforced
these
with
a
third
stepped
aside
from
the
way
my
chela
it
was
no
fault
of
thine
i
delighted
in
the
sight
of
life
the
new
people
upon
the
roads
and
in
thy
joy
at
seeing
these
things
i
was
pleased
with
thee
who
should
have
considered
my
search
and
my
search
alone
now
i
am
sorrowful
because
thou
art
taken
away
and
my
river
is
far
from
me
it
is
the
law
which
i
have
broken
of
darkness
below
said
father
victor
who
wise
in
the
confessional
heard
the
pain
in
every
sentence
see
now
that
the
sign
of
the
red
bull
was
a
sign
for
me
as
well
as
for
thee
all
desire
is
red
and
evil
i
will
do
penance
and
find
my
river
alone
least
go
back
to
the
kulu
woman
said
kim
thou
wilt
be
lost
upon
the
roads
she
will
feed
thee
till
i
run
back
to
thee
the
lama
waved
a
hand
to
show
that
the
matter
was
finally
settled
in
his
mind
his
tone
altered
as
he
turned
to
kim
will
they
do
with
thee
at
least
i
may
acquiring
merit
wipe
out
past
me
a
sahib
so
they
think
the
day
after
tomorrow
i
return
do
not
grieve
what
sort
such
an
one
as
this
or
that
man
he
pointed
to
father
victor
an
one
as
those
i
saw
this
evening
men
wearing
swords
and
stamping
heavily
is
not
well
these
men
follow
desire
and
come
to
emptiness
thou
must
not
be
of
their
sort
umballa
priest
said
that
my
star
was
war
kim
interjected
will
ask
these
fools
but
there
is
truly
no
need
i
will
run
away
this
night
for
all
i
wanted
to
see
the
new
things
kim
put
two
or
three
questions
in
english
to
father
victor
translating
the
replies
to
the
lama
then
says
you
take
him
from
me
and
you
can
not
say
what
you
will
make
him
he
says
tell
me
before
i
go
for
it
is
not
a
small
thing
to
make
a
child
will
be
sent
to
a
school
later
on
we
shall
see
kimball
i
suppose
you
like
to
be
a
soldier
kim
shook
his
head
violently
there
was
nothing
in
his
composition
to
which
drill
and
routine
appealed
will
not
be
a
soldier
will
be
what
you
told
to
be
said
bennett
you
should
be
grateful
that
we
going
to
help
you
kim
smiled
compassionately
if
these
men
lay
under
the
delusion
that
he
would
do
anything
that
he
did
not
fancy
so
much
the
better
another
long
silence
followed
bennett
fidgeted
with
impatience
and
suggested
calling
a
sentry
to
evict
the
fakir
they
give
or
sell
learning
among
the
sahibs
ask
them
said
the
lama
and
kim
interpreted
say
that
money
is
paid
to
the
teacher
but
that
money
the
regiment
will
give
what
need
it
is
only
for
a
night
the
more
money
is
paid
the
better
learning
is
given
the
lama
disregarded
kim
plans
for
an
early
flight
is
no
wrong
to
pay
for
learning
to
help
the
ignorant
to
wisdom
is
always
a
merit
the
rosary
clicked
furiously
as
an
abacus
then
he
faced
his
oppressors
them
for
how
much
money
do
they
give
a
wise
and
suitable
teaching
and
in
what
city
is
that
teaching
given
said
father
victor
in
english
when
kim
had
translated
depends
the
regiment
would
pay
for
you
all
the
time
you
are
at
the
military
orphanage
or
you
might
go
on
the
punjab
masonic
list
not
that
he
or
you
understand
what
that
means
but
the
best
schooling
a
boy
can
get
in
india
is
of
course
at
st
xavier
in
partibus
at
lucknow
this
took
some
time
to
interpret
for
bennett
wished
to
cut
it
short
wants
to
know
how
much
said
kim
placidly
or
three
hundred
rupees
a
year
father
victor
was
long
past
any
sense
of
amazement
bennett
impatient
did
not
understand
says
write
that
name
and
the
money
upon
a
paper
and
give
it
him
and
he
says
you
must
write
your
name
below
because
he
is
going
to
write
a
letter
in
some
days
to
you
he
says
you
are
a
good
man
he
says
the
other
man
is
a
fool
he
is
going
away
the
lama
rose
suddenly
follow
my
search
he
cried
and
was
gone
run
slap
into
the
sentries
cried
father
victor
jumping
up
as
the
lama
stalked
out
i
ca
leave
the
boy
kim
made
swift
motion
to
follow
but
checked
himself
there
was
no
sound
of
challenge
outside
the
lama
had
disappeared
kim
settled
himself
composedly
on
the
chaplain
cot
at
least
the
lama
had
promised
that
he
would
stay
with
the
raiput
woman
from
kulu
and
the
rest
was
of
the
smallest
importance
it
pleased
him
that
the
two
padres
were
so
evidently
excited
they
talked
long
in
undertones
father
victor
urging
some
scheme
on
mr
bennett
who
seemed
incredulous
all
this
was
very
new
and
fascinating
but
kim
felt
sleepy
they
called
men
into
the
tent
one
of
them
certainly
was
the
colonel
as
his
father
had
prophesied
and
they
asked
him
an
infinity
of
questions
chiefly
about
the
woman
who
looked
after
him
all
of
which
kim
answered
truthfully
they
did
not
seem
to
think
the
woman
a
good
guardian
after
all
this
was
the
newest
of
his
experiences
sooner
or
later
if
he
chose
he
could
escape
into
great
grey
formless
india
beyond
tents
and
padres
and
colonels
meantime
if
the
sahibs
were
to
be
impressed
he
would
do
his
best
to
impress
them
he
too
was
a
white
man
after
much
talk
that
he
could
not
comprehend
they
handed
him
over
to
a
sergeant
who
had
strict
instructions
not
to
let
him
escape
the
regiment
would
go
on
to
umballa
and
kim
would
be
sent
up
partly
at
the
expense
of
the
lodge
and
in
part
by
subscription
to
a
place
called
sanawar
miraculous
past
all
whooping

said
father
victor
when
he
had
talked
without
a
break

ten
minutes

drew
his
bow
again
at
a
venture
if
they
were
not
going

at

playmates
on

seas
whenas
we
traded

among
the
savages
ten
thousand
leagues
to
southward
and
thirty
years
removed
they
knew
not
noble
valdez
but
me
they
knew
and
loved
song
of
diego
valdez
very
early
in
the
morning
the
white
tents
came
down
and
disappeared
as
the
mavericks
took
a
to
umballa
it
did
not
skirt
the
and
kim
trudging
beside
a
under
fire
of
comments
from
soldiers
wives
was
not
so
confident
as
overnight
he
discovered
that
he
was
closely
watched
father
victor
on
the
one
side
and
mr
bennett
on
the
other
in
the
forenoon
the
column
checked
a
handed
the
colonel
a
letter
he
read
it
and
spoke
to
a
major
half
a
mile
in
the
rear
kim
heard
a
hoarse
and
joyful
clamour
rolling
down
on
him
through
the
thick
dust
then
someone
beat
him
on
the
back
crying
us
how
ye
knew
ye
little
limb
of
satan
father
dear
see
if
ye
can
make
him
tell
a
pony
ranged
alongside
and
he
was
hauled
on
to
the
priest
saddlebow
my
son
your
prophecy
of
last
night
has
come
true
our
orders
are
to
entrain
at
umballa
for
the
front
tomorrow

thatt
said
kim
for
and
were
newish
words
to
him

going
to
thee
war
as
you
called
it
course
you
are
going
to
thee
war
i
said
last
night
did
but
powers
o
darkness
how
did
ye
know
kim
eyes
sparkled
he
shut
his
lips
nodded
his
head
and
looked
unspeakable
things
the
chaplain
moved
on
through
the
dust
and
privates
sergeants
and
subalterns
called
one
another
attention
to
the
boy
the
colonel
at
the
head
of
the
column
stared
at
him
curiously
was
probably
some
bazar
rumour
he
said
even
then
he
referred
to
the
paper
in
his
hand
it
all
the
thing
was
only
decided
within
the
last
hours
there
many
more
like
you
in
india
said
father
victor
are
you
by
way
o
being
a
lusus
naturae
i
have
told
you
said
the
boy
you
let
me
go
back
to
my
old
man
if
he
has
not
stayed
with
that
woman
from
kulu
i
am
afraid
he
will
die
what
i
saw
of
him
he
as
well
able
to
take
care
of
himself
as
you
no
ye
brought
us
luck
an
we
goin
to
make
a
man
of
you
take
ye
back
to
your
and
ye
come
to
me
this
evening
for
the
rest
of
the
day
kim
found
himself
an
object
of
distinguished
consideration
among
a
few
hundred
white
men
the
story
of
his
appearance
in
camp
the
discovery
of
his
parentage
and
his
prophecy
had
lost
nothing
in
the
telling
a
big
shapeless
white
woman
on
a
pile
of
bedding
asked
him
mysteriously
whether
he
thought
her
husband
would
come
back
from
the
war
kim
reflected
gravely
and
said
that
he
would
and
the
woman
gave
him
food
in
many
respects
this
big
procession
that
played
music
at
intervals
this
crowd
that
talked
and
laughed
so
easily
resembled
a
festival
in
lahore
city
so
far
there
was
no
sign
of
hard
work
and
he
resolved
to
lend
the
spectacle
his
patronage
at
evening
there
came
out
to
meet
them
bands
of
music
and
played
the
mavericks
into
camp
near
umballa
railway
station
that
was
an
interesting
night
men
of
other
regiments
came
to
visit
the
mavericks
the
mavericks
went
visiting
on
their
own
account
their
pickets
hurried
forth
to
bring
them
back
met
pickets
of
strange
regiments
on
the
same
duty
and
after
a
while
the
bugles
blew
madly
for
more
pickets
with
officers
to
control
the
tumult
the
mavericks
had
a
reputation
for
liveliness
to
live
up
to
but
they
fell
in
on
the
platform
next
morning
in
perfect
shape
and
condition
and
kim
left
behind
with
the
sick
women
and
boys
found
himself
shouting
farewells
excitedly
as
the
trains
drew
away
life
as
a
sahib
was
amusing
so
far
but
he
touched
it
with
a
cautious
hand
then
they
marched
him
back
in
charge
of
a
to
empty
barracks
whose
floors
were
covered
with
rubbish
and
string
and
paper
and
whose
ceilings
gave
back
his
lonely
footfall
he
curled
himself
up
on
a
stripped
cot
and
went
to
sleep
an
angry
man
stumped
down
the
veranda
woke
him
up
and
said
he
was
a
schoolmaster
this
was
enough
for
kim
and
he
retired
into
his
shell
he
could
just
puzzle
out
the
various
english
police
notices
in
lahore
city
because
they
affected
his
comfort
and
among
the
many
guests
of
the
woman
who
looked
after
him
had
been
a
queer
german
who
painted
scenery
for
the
parsee
travelling
theatre
he
told
kim
that
he
had
been
the
barricades
in
and
therefore
at
least
that
was
how
it
struck
kim
he
would
teach
the
boy
to
write
in
return
for
food
kim
had
been
kicked
as
far
as
single
letters
but
did
not
think
well
of
them
do
not
know
anything
go
away
said
kim
scenting
evil
hereupon
the
man
caught
him
by
the
ear
dragged
him
to
a
room
in
a
wing
where
a
dozen
were
sitting
on
forms
and
told
him
to
be
still
if
he
could
do
nothing
else
this
he
managed
very
successfully
the
man
explained
something
or
other
with
white
lines
on
a
black
board
for
at
least
half
an
hour
and
kim
continued
his
interrupted
nap
he
much
disapproved
of
the
present
aspect
of
affairs
for
this
was
the
very
school
and
discipline
he
had
spent
of
his
young
life
in
avoiding
suddenly
a
beautiful
idea
occurred
to
him
and
he
wondered
that
he
had
not
thought
of
it
before
the
man
dismissed
them
and
first
to
spring
through
the
veranda
into
the
open
sunshine
was
kim
you
stop
said
a
high
voice
at
his
heels
got
to
look
after
you
my
orders
are
not
to
let
you
out
of
my
sight
where
are
you
goin
it
was
the
who
had
been
hanging
round
him
all
the
forenoon
a
fat
and
freckled
person
of
about
fourteen
and
kim
loathed
him
from
the
soles
of
his
boots
to
his
the
bazar
to
get
sweets
for
you
said
kim
after
thought
the
bazar
out
o
bounds
if
we
go
there
we
get
a
you
come
back
near
can
we
go
kim
did
not
know
what
bounds
meant
but
he
wished
to
be
polite
for
the
present
near
far
you
mean
we
can
go
as
far
as
that
tree
down
the
road
i
will
go
there
right
i
ai
goin
it
too
i
can
watch
you
from
it
no
good
your
runnin
away
if
you
did
they
spot
you
by
your
clothes
that
regimental
stuff
you
wearin
there
ai
a
picket
in
umballa
would
you
back
quicker
than
you
started
out
this
did
not
impress
kim
as
much
as
the
knowledge
that
his
raiment
would
tire
him
out
if
he
tried
to
run
he
slouched
to
the
tree
at
the
corner
of
a
bare
road
leading
towards
the
bazar
and
eyed
the
natives
passing
most
of
them
were
of
the
lowest
caste
kim
hailed
a
sweeper
who
promptly
retorted
with
a
piece
of
unnecessary
insolence
in
the
natural
belief
that
the
european
boy
could
not
follow
it
the
low
quick
answer
undeceived
him
kim
put
his
fettered
soul
into
it
thankful
for
the
late
chance
to
abuse
somebody
in
the
tongue
he
knew
best
now
go
to
the
nearest
in
the
bazar
and
tell
him
to
come
here
i
would
write
a
letter
but
what
manner
of
white
man
son
art
thou
to
need
a
bazar
is
there
not
a
schoolmaster
in
the
barracks
and
hell
is
full
of
the
same
sort
do
my
order

thy
mother

married
under
a
basket
servant
of
lal
beg
kim
knew
the
god
of
the
sweepers
on
my
business
or
we
will
talk
again
the
sweeper
shuffled
off
in
haste
is
a
white
boy
by
the
barracks
waiting
under
a
tree
who
is
not
a
white
boy
he
stammered
to
the
first
bazar
he
came
across
needs
thee
he

said
the
spruce
scribe
gathering
up
his
desk
and
pens
and
all
in
order
do
not
know
he
is
not
like
other
boys
go
and
see
it
is
well
worth
kim
danced
with
impatience
when
the
slim
young
kayeth
hove
in
sight
as
soon
as
his
voice
could
carry
he
cursed
him
volubly
i
will
take
my
pay
the
said
words
have
made
the
price
higher
but
who
art
thou
dressed
in
that
fashion
to

this
fashion

in
the
letter

a
tale

as
full
of
them
as

said
the
writer
sitting
down
and
spreading
his
cloth
in
the
shade
of
a
deserted
mechanically
kim
squatted
beside
him
squatted
as
only
the
natives
can
in
spite
of
the
abominable
clinging
trousers
the
writer
regarded
him
sideways
is
the
price
to
ask
of
sahibs
said
kim
fix
me
a
true
one
anna
and
a
half
how
do
i
know
having
written
the
letter
that
thou
wilt
not
run
away
i
must
not
go
beyond
this
tree
and
there
is
also
the
stamp
to
be
considered
get
no
commission
on
the
price
of
the
stamp
once
more
what
manner
of
white
boy

be
said
in
the
letter
which
is
to
mahbub

the
in
the
kashmir

is
my
friend
on
wonder
murmured
the
dipping
a
reed
in
the
inkstand
be
written
in
hindi
to
mahbub
ali
then
begin
i
have
come
down
with
the
old
man
as
far
as
umballa
in
the
train
at
umballa
i
carried
the
news
of
the
bay
mare
pedigree
after
what
he
had
seen
in
the
garden
he
was
not
going
to
write
of
white
stallions
a
little
what
has
a
bay
mare
to
do
is
it
mahbub
ali
the
great
dealer
else
i
have
been
in
his
service
take
more
ink
again
as
the
order
was
so
i
did
it
we
then
went
on
foot
towards
benares
but
on
the
third
day
we
found
a
certain
regiment
is
that
down
pulton
murmured
the
writer
all
ears
went
into
their
camp
and
was
caught
and
by
means
of
the
charm
about
my
neck
which
thou
knowest
it
was
established
that
i
was
the
son
of
some
man
in
the
regiment
according
to
the
prophecy
of
the
red
bull
which
thou
knowest
was
common
talk
of
our
bazar
kim
waited
for
this
shaft
to
sink
into
the
heart
cleared
his
throat
and
continued
priest
clothed
me
and
gave
me
a
new
name
one
priest
however
was
a
fool
the
clothes
are
very
heavy
but
i
am
a
sahib
and
my
heart
is
heavy
too
they
send
me
to
a
school
and
beat
me
i
do
not
like
the
air
and
water
here
come
then
and
help
me
mahbub
ali
or
send
me
some
money
for
i
have
not
sufficient
to
pay
the
writer
who
writes
this
who
writes
this
it
is
my
own
fault
that
i
was
tricked
thou
art
as
clever
as
husain
bux
that
forged
the
treasury
stamps
at
nucklao
but
what
a
tale
what
a
tale
is
it
true
by
any
chance
does
not
profit
to
tell
lies
to
mahbub
ali
it
is
better
to
help
his
friends
by
lending
them
a
stamp
when
the
money
comes
i
will
repay
the
writer
grunted
doubtfully
but
took
a
stamp
out
of
his
desk
sealed
the
letter
handed
it
over
to
kim
and
departed
mahbub
ali
was
a

my
father
he
came

of

disbelieved
every
word
the
spoke
about
the
liverpool
suburb
which
was
his
england
it
passed
the
heavy
time
till
dinner
a
most
unappetizing
meal
served
to
the
boys
and
a
few
invalids
in
a
corner
of
a
but
that
he
had
written
to
mahbub
ali
kim
would
have
been
almost
depressed
the
indifference
of
native
crowds
he
was
used
to
but
this
strong
loneliness
among
white
men
preyed
on
him
he
was
grateful
when
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
a
big
soldier
took
him
over
to
father
victor
who
lived
in
another
wing
across
another
dusty
the
priest
was
reading
an
english
letter
written
in
purple
ink

looked
at
kim

curiously
than
ever
how

far
as

of

talking
so
much
and
unanxious
residing

now
what

has
asked

her

i
think
he

not

on

she
did
talk
clear
to
you
is
it
it
beats
me
altogether
so
going

for

now
is
that
ravin
lunacy
or
a
business
proposition
i
ask
you
because
i
fairly
at
my
wits
end
says
he
will
give
me
three
hundred
rupees
a
year
so
he
will
give
me
them
that
the
way
you
look
at
it
is
it
course
if
he
says
so
the
priest
whistled
then
he
addressed
kim
as
an
equal
believe
it
but
we
see
you
were
goin
off
today
to
the
military
orphanage
at
sanawar
where
the
regiment
would
keep
you
till
you
were
old
enough
to
enlist
ye
be
brought
up
to
the
church
of
england
bennett
arranged
for
that
on
the
other
hand
if
ye
go
to
st
ye
get
a
better
education
an
an
can
have
the
religion
d
see
my
dilemma
kim
saw
nothing
save
a
vision
of
the
lama
going
south
in
a
train
with
none
to
beg
for
him
most
people
i
going
to
temporize
if
your
friend
sends
the
money
from
benares
powers
of
darkness
below
where
a
to
raise
three
hundred
rupees
ye
go
down
to
lucknow
and
i
pay
your
fare
because
i
ca
touch
the
if
i
intend
as
i
do
to
make
ye
a
catholic
if
he
does
ye
go
to
the
military
orphanage
at
the
regiment
expense
i
allow
him
three
days
grace
though
i
do
believe
it
at
all
even
then
if
he
fails
in
his
payments
later
on
but
it
beyond
me
we
can
only
walk
one
step
at
a
time
in
this
world
praise
god
an
they
sent
bennett
to
the
front
an
left
me
behind
bennett
ca
expect
everything
yess
said
kim
vaguely
the
priest
leaned
forward
give
a
month
pay
to
find
goin
on
inside
that
little
round
head
of
yours
is
nothing
said
kim
and
scratched
it
he
was
wondering
whether
mahbub
ali
would
send
him
as
much
as
a
whole
rupee
then
he
could
pay
the
and
write
letters
to
the
lama
at
benares
perhaps
mahbub
ali
would
visit
him
next
time
he
came
south
with
horses
surely
he
must
know
that
kim
delivery
of
the
letter
to
the
officer
at
umballa
had
caused
the
great
war
which
the
men
and
boys
had
discussed
so
loudly
over
the
barrack
but
if
mahbub
ali
did
not
know
this
it
would
be
very
unsafe
to
tell
him
so
mahbub
ali
was
hard
upon
boys
who
knew
or
thought
they
knew
too
much
till
i
get
further
news
father
victor
voice
interrupted
the
reverie
can
run
along
now
and
play
with
the
other
boys
teach
ye
something
but
i
do
think
ye
like
it
the
day
dragged
to
its
weary
end
when
he
wished
to
sleep
he
was
instructed
how
to
fold
up
his
clothes
and
set
out
his
boots
the
other
boys
deriding
bugles
waked
him
in
the
dawn
the
schoolmaster
caught
him
after
breakfast
thrust
a
page
of
meaningless
characters
under
his
nose
gave
them
senseless
names
and
whacked
him
without
reason
kim
meditated
poisoning
him
with
opium
borrowed
from
a
but
reflected
that
as
they
all
ate
at
one
table
in
public
this
was
peculiarly
revolting
to
kim
who
preferred
to
turn
his
back
on
the
world
at
meals
the
stroke
might
be
dangerous
then
he
attempted
running
off
to
the
village
where
the
priest
had
tried
to
drug
the
lama
the
village
where
the
old
soldier
lived
but
sentries
at
every
exit
headed
back
the
little
scarlet
figure
trousers
and
jacket
crippled
body
and
mind
alike
so
he
abandoned
the
project
and
fell
back
on
time
and
chance
three
days
of
torment
passed
in
the
big
echoing
white
rooms
he
walked
out
of
afternoons
under
escort
of
the
and
all
he
heard
from
his
companions
were
the
few
useless
words
which
seemed
to
make
of
the
white
man
abuse
kim
knew
and
despised
them
all
long
ago
the
boy
resented
his
silence
and
lack
of
interest
by
beating
him
as
was
only
natural
he
did
not
care
for
any
of
the
bazars
which
were
in
bounds
he
styled
all
natives
yet
servants
and
sweepers
called
him
abominable
names
to
his
face
and
misled
by
their
deferential
attitude
he
never
understood
this
somewhat
consoled
kim
for
the
beatings
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
a
judgement
overtook
that
drummer
they
had
gone
out
together
towards
umballa
racecourse
he
returned
alone
weeping
with
news
that
young
to
whom
he
had
been
doing
nothing
in
particular
had
hailed
a
nigger
on
horseback
that
the
nigger
had
then
and
there
laid
into
him
with
a
peculiarly
adhesive
quirt
picked
up
young
and
borne
him
off
at
full
gallop
these
tidings
came
to
father
victor
and
he
drew
down
his
long
upper
lip
he
was
already
sufficiently
startled
by
a
letter
from
the
temple
of
the
tirthankars
at
benares
enclosing
a
native
note
of
hand
for
three
hundred
rupees
and
an
amazing
prayer
to
god
the
lama
would
have
been
more
annoyed
than
the
priest
had
he
known
how
the
bazar
had
translated
his
phrase
acquire
merit
of
darkness
below
father
victor
fumbled
with
the
note
now
he
off
with
another
of
his
friends
i
do
know
whether
it
will
be
a
greater
relief
to
me
to
get
him
back
or
to
have
him
lost
he
beyond
my
comprehension
how
the
divil
yes
he
the
man
i
mean
can
a
raise
money
to
educate
white
boys
three
miles
off
on
umballa
racecourse
mahbub
ali
reining
a
grey
kabuli
stallion
with
kim
in
front
of
him
was
saying
little
friend
of
all
the
world
there
is
my
honour
and
reputation
to
be
considered
all
the
in
all
the
regiments
and
all
umballa
know
mahbub
ali
men
saw
me
pick
thee
up
and
chastise
that
boy
we
are
seen
now
from
far
across
this
plain
how
can
i
take
thee
away
or
account
for
thy
disappearing
if
i
set
thee
down
and
let
thee
run
off
into
the
crops
they
would
put
me
in
jail
be
patient
once
a
sahib
always
a
sahib
when
thou
art
a
man
who
knows
thou
wilt
be
grateful
to
mahbub
ali
me
beyond
their
sentries
where
i
can
change
this
red
give
me
money
and
i
will
go
to
benares
and
be
with
my
lama
again
i
do
not
want
to
be
a
sahib
and
remember
i
did
deliver
that
message
the
stallion
bounded
wildly
mahbub
ali
had
incautiously
driven
home
the
stirrup
he
was
not
the
new
sort
of
fluent
who
wears
english
boots
and
spurs
kim
drew
his
own
conclusions
from
that
betrayal
was
a
small
matter
it
lay
on
the
straight
road
to
benares
i
and
the
sahib
have
by
this
time
forgotten
it
i
send
so
many
letters
and
messages
to
men
who
ask
questions
about
horses
i
can
not
well
remember
one
from
the
other
was
it
some
matter
of
a
bay
mare
that
peters
sahib
wished
the
pedigree
of
kim
saw
the
trap
at
once
if
he
had
said
mare
mahbub
would
have
known
by
his
very
readiness
to
fall
in
with
the
amendment
that
the
boy
suspected
something
kim
replied
therefore
mare
no
i
do
not
forget
my
messages
thus
it
was
a
white
stallion
so
it
was
a
white
arab
stallion
but
thou
didst
write
bay
mare
to
me
cares
to
tell
truth
to
a
kim
answered
feeling
mahbub
palm
on
his
heart
mahbub
you
old
villain
pull
up
cried
a
voice
and
an
englishman
raced
alongside
on
a
little
been
chasing
you
half
over
the
country
that
kabuli
of
yours
can
go
for
sale
i
suppose
have
some
young
stuff
coming
on
made
by
heaven
for
the
delicate
and
difficult
he
has
no
equal
he
polo
and
waits
at
table
yes
we
know
all
that
what
the
deuce
have
you
got
there
boy
said
mahbub
gravely
was
being
beaten
by
another
boy
his
father
was
once
a
white
soldier
in
the
big
war
the
boy
was
a
child
in
lahore
city
he
played
with
my
horses
when
he
was
a
babe
now
i
think
they
will
make
him
a
soldier
he
has
been
newly
caught
by
his
father
regiment
that
went
up
to
the
war
last
week
but
i
do
not
think
he
wants
to
be
a
soldier
i
take
him
for
a
ride
tell
me
where
thy
barracks
are
and
i
will
set
thee
there
me
go
i
can
find
the
barracks
alone
if
thou
runnest
away
who
will
say
it
is
not
my
fault
run
back
to
his
dinner
where
has
he
to
run
to
the
englishman
asked
was
born
in
the
land
he
has
friends
he
goes
where
he
chooses
he
is
a
chabuk
sawai
a
sharp
chap
it
needs
only
to
change
his
clothing
and
in
a
twinkling
he
would
be
a
hindu
boy
deuce
he
would
the
englishman
looked
critically
at
the
boy
as
mahbub
headed
towards
the
barracks
kim
ground
his
teeth
mahbub
was
mocking
him
as
faithless
afghans
will
for
he
went
on
will
send
him
to
a
school
and
put
heavy
boots
on
his
feet
and
swaddle
him
in
these
clothes
then
he
will
forget
all
he
knows
now
which
of
the
barracks
is
thine
kim
pointed
he
could
not
speak
to
father
victor
wing
all
staring
white
near
by
he
will
make
a
good
soldier
said
mahbub
reflectively
will
make
a
good
orderly
at
least
i
sent
him
to
deliver
a
message
once
from
lahore
a
message
concerning
the
pedigree
of
a
white
stallion
here
was
deadly
insult
on
deadlier
injury
and
the
sahib
to
whom
he
had
so
craftily
given
that
letter
heard
it
all
kim
beheld
mahbub
ali
frying
in
flame
for
his
treachery
but
for
himself
he
saw
one
long
grey
vista
of
barracks
schools
and
barracks
again
he
gazed
imploringly
at
the
face
in
which
there
was
no
glimmer
of
recognition
but
even
at
this
extremity
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
throw
himself
on
the
white
man
mercy
or
to
denounce
the
afghan
and
mahbub
stared
deliberately
at
the
englishman
who
stared
as
deliberately
at
kim
quivering
and
horse
is
well
trained
said
the
dealer
would
have
kicked
sahib
said
the
englishman
at
last
rubbing
his
pony
damp
withers
with
his
makes
the
boy
a
soldier
says
the
regiment
that
found
him
and
especially
the
of
that
regiment
is
the
padre
kim
choked
as
father
victor
sailed
down
upon
them
from
the
veranda
o
darkness
below
how
many
more
mixed
friends
do
you
keep
in
asia
he
cried
as
kim
slid
down
and
stood
helplessly
before
him
morning
padre
the
englishman
said
cheerily
know
you
by
reputation
well
enough
meant
to
have
come
over
and
called
before
this
i
creighton
the
ethnological

father
victor
the
englishman
nodded
i
glad
to
meet
ye
then
an
i
owe
you
some
thanks
for
bringing
back
the
boy
thanks
to

besides
the

was
going
away

do
know
old
mahbub
ali
the
sat
impassive
in
the
sunlight
will
when
you
have
been
in
the
station
a
month
he
sells

all
our
crocks
that
boy
is
rather
a
curiosity

tell
you
puffed
father
victor
be
the
one
man
that
could
help
me
in
my
quandaries
tell
you

o
darkness
bursting
to
tell
someone
who
knows
something
o
the
native
a
groom
came
round
the
corner
colonel
creighton
raised
his
voice
speaking
in
urdu
good
mahbub

but
what
is
the
use

and

of

privileged

of

a
regular
old
leech

off
to

with
mahbub
queer
sort
of
boy
might
i
ask
you
to
send
my
mare
round
under
cover
he
dropped
into
a
chair
which
commanded
a
clear
view
of
kim
and
mahbub
ali
in
conference
beneath
the
tree
the
padre
went
indoors
for
cheroots
creighton
heard
kim
say
bitterly
a
brahmin
before
a
snake
and
a
snake
before
an
harlot
and
an
harlot
before
a
pathan
mahbub
ali
is
all
one
the
great
red
beard
wagged
solemnly
should
not
see
a
carpet
on
the
loom
till
the
pattern
is
made
plain
believe
me
friend
of
all
the
world
i
do
thee
great
service
they
will
not
make
a
soldier
of
thee
crafty
old
sinner
thought
creighton
you
not
far
wrong
that
boy
must
be
wasted
if
he
is
as
advertised
me
half
a
minute
cried
the
padre
from
within
gettin
the
documents
in
the
case
through
me
the
favour
of
this
bold
and
wise
colonel
sahib
comes
to
thee
and
thou
art
raised
to
honour
what
thanks
wilt
thou
give
mahbub
ali
when
thou
art
a
man
nay
i
begged
thee
to
let
me
take
the
road
again
where
i
should
have
been
safe
and
thou
hast
sold
me
back
to
the
english
what
will
they
give
thee
for
cheerful
young
demon
the
colonel
bit
his
cigar
and
turned
politely
to
father
victor
are
the
letters
that
the
fat
priest
is
waving
before
the
colonel
stand
behind
the
stallion
as
though
looking
at
my
bridle
said
mahbub
ali
letter
from
my
lama
which
he
wrote
from
jagadhir
road
saying
that
he
will
pay
three
hundred
rupees
by
the
year
for
my
schooling
is
old
red
hat
of
that
sort
at
which
school
knows
i
think
in
nucklao
there
is
a
big
school
there
for
the
sons
of
sahibs
and
i
have
seen
it
when
i
sell
horses
there
so
the
lama
also
loved
the
friend
of
all
the
world
and
he
did
not
tell
lies
or
return
me
to
captivity
wonder
the
padre
does
not
know
how
to
unravel
the
thread
how
fast
he
talks
to
the
colonel
sahib
mahbub
ali
chuckled
allah
the
keen
eyes
swept
the
veranda
for
an
instant
lama
has
sent
what
to
me
looks
like
a
note
of
hand
i
have
had
some
few
dealings
in
hoondis
the
colonel
sahib
is
looking
at
it
good
is
all
this
to
me
said
kim
wearily
wilt
go
away
and
they
will
return
me
to
those
empty
rooms
where
there
is
no
good
place
to
sleep
and
where
the
boys
beat
me
do
not
think
that
have
patience
child
all
pathans
are
not
faithless
except
in
horseflesh
five
ten
fifteen
minutes
passed
father
victor
talking
energetically
or
asking
questions
which
the
colonel
answered
i
told
you
everything
that
i
know
about
the
boy
from
beginnin
to
end
and
it
a
blessed
relief
to
me
did
ye
ever
hear
the
like
any
rate
the
old
man
has
sent
the
money
gobind
sahai
notes
of
hand
are
good
from
here
to
china
said
the
colonel
more
one
knows
about
natives
the
less
can
one
say
what
they
will
or
wo
do
consolin
from
the
head
of
the
ethnological
survey
it
this
mixture
of
red
bulls
and
rivers
of
healing
poor
heathen
god
help
him
an
notes
of
hand
and
masonic
certificates
are
you
a
mason
by
any
chance
jove
i
am
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
that
an
additional
reason
said
the
colonel
absently
glad
ye
see
a
reason
in
it
but
as
i
said
it
the
mixture
things
that
beyond
me
an
his
prophesyin
to
our
colonel
sitting
on
my
bed
with
his
little
shimmy
torn
open
showing
his
white
skin
the
prophecy
comin
true
they
cure
all
that
nonsense
at
st
xavier
eh
him
with
holy
water
the
colonel
laughed
my
word
i
fancy
i
ought
to
sometimes
but
i
hoping
he
be
brought
up
as
a
good
catholic
all
that
troubles
me
is
what
happen
if
the
old
lama
my
dear
sir
and
some
of
them
are
gentlemen
in
their
own
country
lama
then
fails
to
pay
next
year
he
a
fine
business
head
to
plan
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
but
he
bound
to
die
some
day
takin
a
heathen
money
to
give
a
child
a
christian
education
he
said
explicitly
what
he
wanted
as
soon
as
he
knew
the
boy
was
white
he
seems
to
have
made
his
arrangements
accordingly
i
give
a
month
pay
to
hear
how
he
explained
it
all
at
the
tirthankars
temple
at
benares
look
here
padre
i
do
pretend
to
know
much
about
natives
but
if
he
says
he
pay
he
pay
dead
or
alive
i
mean
his
heirs
will
assume
the
debt
my
advice
to
you
is
send
the
boy
down
to
lucknow
if
your
anglican
chaplain
thinks
you
stolen
a
march
on
him
luck
to
bennett
he
was
sent
to
the
front
instead
o
me
doughty
certified
me
medically
unfit
i
excommunicate
doughty
if
he
comes
back
alive
surely
bennett
ought
to
be
content
with
leaving
you
the
religion
quite
so
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
think
bennett
will
mind
put
the
blame
on
me
i
er
strongly
recommend
sending
the
boy
to
st
xavier
he
can
go
down
on
pass
as
a
soldier
orphan
so
the
railway
fare
will
be
saved
you
can
buy
him
an
outfit
from
the
regimental
subscription
the
lodge
will
be
saved
the
expense
of
his
education
and
that
will
put
the
lodge
in
a
good
temper
it
perfectly
easy
i
got
to
go
down
to
lucknow
next
week
look
after
the
boy
on
the
way
give
him
in
charge
of
my
servants
and
so
on
a
good
man
in
the
least
do
make
that
mistake
the
lama
has
sent
us
money
for
a
definite
end
we
ca
very
well
return
it
we
shall
have
to
do
as
he
says
well
that
settled
is
it
shall
we
say
that
tuesday
next
you
hand
him
over
to
me
at
the
night
train
south
that
only
three
days
he
ca
do
much
harm
in
three
days
a
weight
off
my
mind
but
this
thing
here
he
waved
the
note
of
hand
do
know
gobind
sahai
or
his
bank
which
may
be
a
hole
in
a
wall
never
been
a
subaltern
in
debt
i
cash
it
if
you
like
and
send
you
the
vouchers
in
proper
order
with
all
your
own
work
too
it
askin
not
the
least
trouble
indeed
you
see
as
an
ethnologist
the
thing
very
interesting
to
me
i
like
to
make
a
note
of
it
for
some
government
work
that
i
doing
the
transformation
of
a
regimental
badge
like
your
red
bull
into
a
sort
of
fetish
that
the
boy
follows
is
very
interesting
i
ca
thank
you
enough
one
thing
you
can
do
all
we
ethnological
men
are
as
jealous
as
jackdaws
of
one
another
discoveries
they
of
no
interest
to
anyone
but
ourselves
of
course
but
you
know
what
are
like
well
do
say
a
word
directly
or
indirectly
about
the
asiatic
side
of
the
boy
character
his
adventures
and
his
prophecy
and
so
on
i
worm
them
out
of
the
boy
later
on
and
you
see
do
ye
make
a
wonderful
account
of
it
never
a
word
will
i
say
to
anyone
till
i
see
it
in
print
you
that
goes
straight
to
an
ethnologist
heart
well
i
must
be
getting
back
to
my
breakfast
good
heavens
old
mahbub
here
still
he
raised
his
voice
and
the
came
out
from
under
the
shadow
of
the
tree
what
is
it
regards
that
young
horse
said
mahbub
say
that
when
a
colt
is
born
to
be
a
closely
following
the
ball
without
teaching
when
such
a
colt
knows
the
game
by
divination
then
i
say
it
is
a
great
wrong
to
break
that
colt
to
a
heavy
cart
sahib
say
i
also
mahbub
the
colt
will
be
entered
for
polo
only
these
fellows
think
of
nothing
in
the
world
but
horses
padre
i
see
you
tomorrow
mahbub
if
you
anything
likely
for
sale
the
dealer
saluted
with
a
sweep
of
the
off
hand
patient
a
little
friend
of
all
the
world
he
whispered
to
the
agonized
kim
fortune
is
made
in
a
little
while
thou
goest
to
nucklao
and
here
is
something
to
pay
the
i
shall
see
thee
again
i
think
many
times
and
he
cantered
off
down
the
road
to
me
said
the
colonel
from
the
veranda
speaking
in
the
vernacular
three
days
thou
wilt
go
with
me
to
lucknow
seeing
and
hearing
new
things
all
the
while
therefore
sit
still
for
three
days
and
do
not
run
away
thou
wilt
go
to
school
at
lucknow
i
meet
my
holy
one
there
kim
whimpered
least
lucknow
is
nearer
to
benares
than
umballa
it
may
be
thou
wilt
go
under
my
protection
mahbub
ali
knows
this
and
he
will
be
angry
if
thou
returnest
to
the
road
now
remember
much
has
been
told
me
which
i
do
not
forget
will
wait
said
kim
the
boys
will
beat
me
then
the
bugles
blew
for
dinner

use
the

sir
john
christie
in
the
afternoon
the
schoolmaster
told
kim
that
he
had
been
off
the
strength
which
conveyed
no
meaning
to
him
till
he
was
ordered
to
go
away
and
play
then
he
ran
to
the
bazar
and
found
the
young
to
whom
he
owed
a
stamp
i
pay
said
kim
royally
now
i
need
another
letter
to
be
written
ali
is
in
umballa
said
the
writer
jauntily
he
was
by
virtue
of
his
office
a
bureau
of
general
misinformation
is
not
to
mahbub
but
to
a
priest
take
thy
pen
and
write
quickly
to
teshoo
lama
the
holy
one
from
bhotiyal
seeking
for
a
river
who
is
now
in
the
temple
of
the
tirthankars
at
benares
take
more
ink
in
three
days
i
am
to
go
down
to
nucklao
to
the
school
at
nucklao
the
name
of
the
school
is
xavier
i
do
not
know
where
that
school
is
but
it
is
at
nucklao
i
know
nucklao
the
writer
interrupted
know
the
school
him
where
it
is
and
i
give
half
an
anna
the
reed
pen
scratched
busily
can
not
mistake
the
man
lifted
his
head
watches
us
across
the
street
kim
looked
up
hurriedly
and
saw
colonel
creighton
in
that
is
some
sahib
who
knows
the
fat
priest
in
the
barracks
he
is
beckoning
me
dost
thou
said
the
colonel
when
kim
trotted
up
i
am
not
running
away
i
send
a
letter
to
my
holy
one
at
benares
had
not
thought
of
that
hast
thou
said
that
i
take
thee
to
lucknow
i
have
not
read
the
letter
if
there
be
a
doubt
why
hast
thou
left
out
my
name
in
writing
to
that
holy
one
the
colonel
smiled
a
queer
smile
kim
took
his
courage
in
both
hands
was
said
once
to
me
that
it
is
inexpedient
to
write
the
names
of
strangers
concerned
in
any
matter
because
by
the
naming
of
names
many
good
plans
are
brought
to
confusion
hast
been
well
taught
the
colonel
replied
and
kim
flushed
have
left
my
in
the
padre
veranda
bring
it
to
my
house
this
even
is
the
house
said
kim
his
quick
wit
told
him
that
he
was
being
tested
in
some
fashion
or
another
and
he
stood
on
guard
anyone
in
the
big
bazar
the
colonel
walked
on
has
forgotten
his
said
kim
returning
must
bring
it
to
him
this
evening
that
is
all
my
letter
except
thrice
over
come
to
me
come
to
me
come
to
me
now
i
will
pay
for
a
stamp
and
put
it
in
the
post
he
rose
to
go
and
as
an
afterthought
asked
is
that
sahib
who
lost
the
he
is
only
creighton
sahib
a
very
foolish
sahib
who
is
a
colonel
sahib
without
a
regiment
is
his
business
knows
he
is
always
buying
horses
which
he
can
not
ride
and
asking
riddles
about
the
works
of
god
such
as
plants
and
stones
and
the
customs
of
people
the
dealers
call
him
the
father
of
fools
because
he
is
so
easily
cheated
about
a
horse
mahbub
ali
says
he
is
madder
than
most
other
sahibs
said
kim
and
departed
his
training
had
given
him
some
small
knowledge
of
character
and
he
argued
that
fools
are
not
given
information
which
leads
to
calling
out
eight
thousand
men
besides
guns
the
of
all
india
does
not
talk
as
kim
had
heard
him
talk
to
fools
nor
would
mahbub
ali
tone
have
changed
as
it
did
every
time
he
mentioned
the
colonel
name
if
the
colonel
had
been
a
fool
consequently
and
this
set
kim
to
skipping
there
was
a
mystery
somewhere
and
mahbub
ali
probably
spied
for
the
colonel
much
as
kim
had
spied
for
mahbub
and
like
the
the
colonel
evidently
respected
people
who
did
not
show
themselves
to
be
too
clever
he
rejoiced
that
he
had
not
betrayed
his
knowledge
of
the
house
and
when
on
his
return
to
barracks
he
discovered
that
no
had
been
left
behind
he
beamed
with
delight
here
was
a
man
after
his
own
heart
a
tortuous
and
indirect
person
playing
a
hidden
game
well
if
he
could
be
a
fool
so
could
kim
he
showed
nothing
of
his
mind
when
father
victor
for
three
long
mornings
discoursed
to
him
of
an
entirely
new
set
of
gods
and
godlings
notably
of
a
goddess
called
mary
who
he
gathered
was
one
with
bibi
miriam
of
mahbub
ali
theology
he
betrayed
no
emotion
when
after
the
lecture
father
victor
dragged
him
from
shop
to
shop
buying
articles
of
outfit
nor
when
envious
kicked
him
because
he
was
going
to
a
superior
school
did
he
complain
but
awaited
the
play
of
circumstances
with
an
interested
soul
father
victor
good
man
took
him
to
the
station
put
him
into
an
empty
next
to
colonel
creighton
first
and
bade
him
farewell
with
genuine
feeling
make
a
man
o
you
at
st
xavier
a
white
man
an
i
hope
a
good
man
they
know
all
about
your
comin
an
the
colonel
will
see
that
ye
not
lost
or
mislaid
anywhere
on
the
road
given
you
a
notion
of
religious
matters
at
least
i
hope
so
and
you
remember
when
they
ask
you
your
religion
that
you
a
better
say
roman
tho
i
not
fond
of
the
word
kim
lit
a
rank
cigarette
he
had
been
careful
to
buy
a
stock
in
the
bazar
and
lay
down
to
think
this
solitary
passage
was
very
different
from
that
joyful
in
the
with
the
lama
get
little
pleasure
of
travel
he
reflected
mai
i
go
from
one
place
to
another
as
it
might
be
a
kickball
it
is
my
kismet
no
man
can
escape
his
kismet
but
i
am
to
pray
to
bibi
miriam
and
i
am
a
sahib
he
looked
at
his
boots
ruefully
i
am
kim
this
is
the
great
world
and
i
am
only
kim
who
is
kim
he
considered
his
own
identity
a
thing
he
had
never
done
before
till
his
head
swam
he
was
one
insignificant
person
in
all
this
roaring
whirl
of
india
going
southward
to
he
knew
not
what
fate
presently
the
colonel
sent
for
him
and
talked
for
a
long
time
so
far
as
kim
could
gather
he
was
to
be
diligent
and
enter
the
survey
of
india
as
a
if
he
were
very
good
and
passed
the
proper
examinations
he
would
be
earning
thirty
rupees
a
month
at
seventeen
years
old
and
colonel
creighton
would
see
that
he
found
suitable
employment
kim
pretended
at
first
to
understand
perhaps
one
word
in
three
of
this
talk
then
the
colonel
seeing
his
mistake
turned
to
fluent
and
picturesque
urdu
and
kim
was
contented
no
man
could
be
a
fool
who
knew
the
language
so
intimately
who
moved
so
gently
and
silently
and
whose
eyes
were
so
different
from
the
dull
fat
eyes
of
other
sahibs
and
thou
must
learn
how
to
make
pictures
of
roads
and
mountains
and
rivers
to
carry
these
pictures
in
thine
eye
till
a
suitable
time
comes
to
set
them
upon
paper
perhaps
some
day
when
thou
art
a
i
may
say
to
thee
when
we
are
working
together
go
across
those
hills
and
see
what
lies
beyond
then
one
will
say
there
are
bad
people
living
in
those
hills
who
will
slay
the
if
he
be
seen
to
look
like
a
sahib
what
then
kim
thought
would
it
be
safe
to
return
the
colonel
lead
would
tell
what
that
other
man
had
said
if
i
answered
i
will
give
thee
a
hundred
rupees
for
knowledge
of
what
is
behind
those
hills
for
a
picture
of
a
river
and
a
little
news
of
what
the
people
say
in
the
villages
there
can
i
tell
i
am
only
a
boy
wait
till
i
am
a
man
then
seeing
the
colonel
brow
clouded
he
went
on
i
think
i
should
in
a
few
days
earn
the
hundred
rupees
what
road
kim
shook
his
head
resolutely
i
said
how
i
would
earn
them
another
man
might
hear
and
forestall
me
it
is
not
good
to
sell
knowledge
for
nothing
now
the
colonel
held
up
a
rupee
kim
hand
half
reached
towards
it
and
dropped
sahib
nay
i
know
the
price
that
will
be
paid
for
the
answer
but
i
do
not
know
why
the
question
is
asked
it
for
a
gift
then
said
creighton
tossing
it
over
is
a
good
spirit
in
thee
do
not
let
it
be
blunted
at
st
xavier
there
are
many
boys
there
who
despise
the
black
men
mothers
were
said
kim
he
knew
well
there
is
no
hatred
like
that
of
the
for
his
but
thou
art
a
sahib
and
the
son
of
a
sahib
therefore
do
not
at
any
time
be
led
to
contemn
the
black
men
i
have
known
boys
newly
entered
into
the
service
of
the
government
who
feigned
not
to
understand
the
talk
or
the
customs
of
black
men
their
pay
was
cut
for
ignorance
there
is
no
sin
so
great
as
ignorance
remember
this
several
times
in
the
course
of
the
long
hours
run
south
did
the
colonel
send
for
kim
always
developing
this
latter
text
be
all
on
one
then
said
kim
at
last
colonel
mahbub
ali
and
i
when
i
become
a
he
will
use
me
as
mahbub
ali
employed
me
i
think
that
is
good
if
it
allows
me
to
return
to
the
road
again
this
clothing
grows
no
easier
by
wear
when
they
came
to
the
crowded
lucknow
station
there
was
no
sign
of
the
lama
he
swallowed
his
disappointment
while
the
colonel
bundled
him
into
a
with
his
neat
belongings
and
despatched
him
alone
to
st
xavier
do
not
say
farewell
because
we
shall
meet
again
he
cried
and
many
times
if
thou
art
one
of
good
spirit
but
thou
art
not
yet
tried
when
i
brought
thee
kim
actually
dared
to
use
the
turn
of
equals
white
stallion
pedigree
that
night
is
gained
by
forgetting
little
brother
said
the
colonel
with
a
look
that
pierced
through
kim
as
he
scuttled
into
the
carriage
it
took
him
nearly
five
minutes
to
recover
then
he
sniffed
the
new
air
appreciatively
rich
city
he
said
than
lahore
how
good
the
bazars
must
be
coachman
drive
me
a
little
through
the
bazars
here
order
is
to
take
thee
to
the
school
the
driver
used
the
which
is
rudeness
when
applied
to
a
white
man
in
the
clearest
and
most
fluent
vernacular
kim
pointed
out
his
error
climbed
on
to
the
and
perfect
understanding
established
drove
for
a
couple
of
hours
up
and
down
estimating
comparing
and
enjoying
there
is
no
city
except
bombay
the
queen
of
all
more
beautiful
in
her
garish
style
than
lucknow
whether
you
see
her
from
the
bridge
over
the
river
or
from
the
top
of
the
imambara
looking
down
on
the
gilt
umbrellas
of
the
chutter
munzil
and
the
trees
in
which
the
town
is
bedded
kings
have
adorned
her
with
fantastic
buildings
endowed
her
with
charities
crammed
her
with
pensioners
and
drenched
her
with
blood
she
is
the
centre
of
all
idleness
intrigue
and
luxury
and
shares
with
delhi
the
claim
to
talk
the
only
pure
urdu
fair
city
a
beautiful
city
the
driver
as
a
lucknow
man
was
pleased
with
the
compliment
and
told
kim
many
astounding
things
where
an
english
guide
would
have
talked
of
the
mutiny
we
will
go
to
the
school
said
kim
at
last
the
great
old
school
of
st
xavier
in
partibus
block
on
block
of
low
white
buildings
stands
in
vast
grounds
over
against
the
gumti
river
at
some
distance
from
the
city
like
of
folk
are
they
within
said
kim
sahibs
all
devils
but
to
speak
truth
and
i
drive
many
of
them
to
and
fro
from
the
railway
station
i
have
never
seen
one
that
had
in
him
the
making
of
a
more
perfect
devil
than
thou
this
young
sahib
whom
i
am
now
driving
naturally
for
he
was
never
trained
to
consider
them
in
any
way
improper
kim
had
passed
the
time
of
day
with
one
or
two
frivolous
ladies
at
upper
windows
in
a
certain
street
and
naturally
in
the
exchange
of
compliments
had
acquitted
himself
well
he
was
about
to
acknowledge
the
driver
last
insolence
when
his
eye
it
was
growing
dusk
caught
a
figure
sitting
by
one
of
the
white
plaster
in
the
long
sweep
of
wall
he
cried
here
i
do
not
go
to
the
school
at
once
what
is
to
pay
me
for
this
coming
and
said
the
driver
petulantly
the
boy
mad
last
time
it
was
a
this
time
it
is
a
priest
kim
was
in
the
road
headlong
patting
the
dusty
feet
beneath
the
dirty
yellow
robe
have
waited
here
a
day
and
a
half
the
lama
level
voice
began
i
had
a
disciple
with
me
he
that
was
my
friend
at
the
temple
of
the
tirthankars
gave
me
a
guide
for
this
journey
i
came
from
benares
in
the
when
thy
letter
was
given
me
yes
i
am
well
fed
i
need
nothing
why
didst
thou
not
stay
with
the
kulu
woman
o
holy
one
in
what
way
didst
thou
get
to
benares
my
heart
has
been
heavy
since
we
parted
woman
wearied
me
by
constant
flux
of
talk
and
requiring
charms
for
children
i
separated
myself
from
that
company
permitting
her
to
acquire
merit
by
gifts
she
is
at
least
a
woman
of
open
hands
and
i
made
a
promise
to
return
to
her
house
if
need
arose
then
perceiving
myself
alone
in
this
great
and
terrible
world
i
bethought
me
of
the
to
benares
where
i
knew
one
abode
in
the
tirthankars
temple
who
was
a
seeker
even
as
i
thy
river
said
kim
had
forgotten
the
river
soon
my
chela
i
have
never
forgotten
it
but
when
i
had
left
thee
it
seemed
better
that
i
should
go
to
the
temple
and
take
counsel
for
look
you
india
is
very
large
and
it
may
be
that
wise
men
before
us
some
two
or
three
have
left
a
record
of
the
place
of
our
river
there
is
debate
in
the
temple
of
the
tirthankars
on
this
matter
some
saying
one
thing
and
some
another
they
are
courteous
folk
be
it
but
what
dost
thou
do
now
acquire
merit
in
that
i
help
thee
my
chela
to
wisdom
the
priest
of
that
body
of
men
who
serve
the
red
bull
wrote
me
that
all
should
be
as
i
desired
for
thee
i
sent
the
money
to
suffice
for
one
year
and
then
i
came
as
thou
seest
me
to
watch
for
thee
going
up
into
the
gates
of
learning
a
day
and
a
half
have
i
waited
not
because
i
was
led
by
any
affection
towards
thee
that
is
no
part
of
the
way
but
as
they
said
at
the
tirthankars
temple
because
money
having
been
paid
for
learning
it
was
right
that
i
should
oversee
the
end
of
the
matter
they
resolved
my
doubts
most
clearly
i
had
a
fear
that
perhaps
i
came
because
i
wished
to
see
thee
misguided
by
the
red
mist
of
affection
it
is
not
so
moreover
i
am
troubled
by
a
dream
surely
holy
one
thou
hast
not
forgotten
the
road
and
all
that
befell
on
it
surely
it
was
a
little
to
see
me
that
thou
didst
come
horses
are
cold
and
it
is
past
their
whined
the
driver
to
jehannum
and
abide
there
with
thy
reputationless
aunt
kim
snarled
over
his
shoulder
am
all
alone
in
this
land
i
know
not
where
i
go
nor
what
shall
befall
me
my
heart
was
in
that
letter
i
sent
thee
except
for
mahbub
ali
and
he
is
a
pathan
i
have
no
friend
save
thee
holy
one
do
not
altogether
go
away
have
considered
that
also
the
lama
replied
in
a
shaking
voice
is
manifest
that
from
time
to
time
i
shall
acquire
merit
if
before
that
i
have
not
found
my
river
by
assuring
myself
that
thy
feet
are
set
on
wisdom
what
they
will
teach
thee
i
do
not
know
but
the
priest
wrote
me
that
no
son
of
a
sahib
in
all
india
will
be
better
taught
than
thou
so
from
time
to
time
therefore
i
will
come
again
maybe
thou
wilt
be
such
a
sahib
as
he
who
gave
me
these
spectacles
the
lama
wiped
them
elaborately
the
wonder
house
at
lahore
that
is
my
hope
for
he
was
a
fountain
of
wisdom
wiser
than
many
abbots
again
maybe
thou
wilt
forget
me
and
our
meetings
i
eat
thy
bread
cried
kim
passionately
shall
i
ever
forget
thee
no
he
put
the
boy
aside
must
go
back
to
benares
from
time
to
time
now
that
i
know
the
customs
of
in
this
land
i
will
send
thee
a
letter
and
from
time
to
time
i
will
come
and
see
thee
whither
shall
i
send
my
letters
wailed
kim
clutching
at
the
robe
all
forgetful
that
he
was
a
sahib
the
temple
of
the
tirthankars
at
benares
that
is
the
place
i
have
chosen
till
i
find
my
river
do
not
weep
for
look
you
all
desire
is
illusion
and
a
new
binding
upon
the
wheel
go
up
to
the
gates
of
learning
let
me
see
thee
go
dost
thou
love
me
then
go
or
my
heart
cracks
i
will
come
again
surely
i
will
come
again
the
lama
watched
the
rumble
into
the
compound
and
strode
off
snuffing
between
each
long
stride
gates
of
learning
shut
with
a
clang
the
country
born
and
bred
boy
has
his
own
manners
and
customs
which
do
not
resemble
those
of
any
other
land
and
his
teachers
approach
him
by
roads
which
an
english
master
would
not
understand
therefore
you
would
scarcely
be
interested
in
kim
experiences
as
a
st
xavier
boy
among
two
or
three
hundred
precocious
youths
most
of
whom
had
never
seen
the
sea
he
suffered
the
usual
penalties
for
breaking
out
of
bounds
when
there
was
cholera
in
the
city
this
was
before
he
had
learned
to
write
fair
english
and
so
was
obliged
to
find
a
bazar
he
was
of
course
indicted
for
smoking
and
for
the
use
of
abuse
more
than
even
st
xavier
had
ever
heard
he
learned
to
wash
himself
with
the
levitical
scrupulosity
of
the
who
in
his
heart
considers
the
englishman
rather
dirty
he
played
the
usual
tricks
on
the
patient
coolies
pulling
the
punkahs
in
the
where
the
boys
threshed
through
the
hot
nights
telling
tales
till
the
dawn
and
quietly
he
measured
himself
against
his
mates
they
were
sons
of
subordinate
officials
in
the
railway
telegraph
and
canal
services
of
sometimes
retired
and
sometimes
acting
as
to
a
feudatory
rajah
army
of
captains
of
the
indian
marine
government
pensioners
planters
presidency
shopkeepers
and
missionaries
a
few
were
cadets
of
the
old
eurasian
houses
that
have
taken
strong
root
in
dhurrumtollah
pereiras
de
souzas
and
their
parents
could
well
have
educated
them
in
england
but
they
loved
the
school
that
had
served
their
own
youth
and
generation
followed
generation
at
st
xavier
their
homes
ranged
from
howrah
of
the
railway
people
to
abandoned
cantonments
like
monghyr
and
chunar
lost
villages
where
their
fathers
were
large
landholders
in
oudh
or
the
deccan
a
week
from
the
nearest
railway
line
seaports
a
thousand
miles
south
facing
the
brazen
indian
surf
and
south
of
all
the
mere
story
of
their
adventures
which
to
them
were
no
adventures
on
their
road
to
and
from
school
would
have
crisped
a
western
hair
they
were
used
to
jogging
off
alone
through
a
hundred
miles
of
jungle
where
there
was
always
the
delightful
chance
of
being
delayed
by
tigers
but
they
would
no
more
have
bathed
in
the
english
channel
in
an
english
august
than
their
brothers
across
the
world
would
have
lain
still
while
a
leopard
snuffed
at
their
palanquin
there
were
boys
of
fifteen
who
had
spent
a
day
and
a
half
on
an
islet
in
the
middle
of
a
flooded
river
taking
charge
as
by
right
of
a
camp
of
frantic
pilgrims
returning
from
a
shrine
there
were
seniors
who
had
requisitioned
a
rajah
elephant
in
the
name
of
st
francis
xavier
when
the
rains
once
blotted
out
the
that
led
to
their
father
estate
and
had
all
but
lost
the
huge
beast
in
a
quicksand
there
was
a
boy
who
he
said
and
none
doubted
had
helped
his
father
to
beat
off
with
rifles
from
the
veranda
a
rush
of
akas
in
the
days
when
those
were
bold
against
lonely
plantations
and
every
tale
was
told
in
the
even
passionless
voice
of
the
mixed
with
quaint
reflections
borrowed
unconsciously
from
native
and
turns
of
speech
that
showed
they
had
been
that
instant
translated
from
the
vernacular
kim
watched
listened
and
approved
this
was
not
insipid
talk
of
it
dealt
with
a
life
he
knew
and
in
part
understood
the
atmosphere
suited
him
and
he
throve
by
inches
they
gave
him
a
white
drill
suit
as
the
weather
warmed
and
he
rejoiced
in
the
bodily
comforts
as
he
rejoiced
to
use
his
sharpened
mind
over
the
tasks
they
set
him
his
quickness
would
have
delighted
an
english
master
but
at
st
xavier
they
know
the
first
rush
of
minds
developed
by
sun
and
surroundings
as
they
know
the
that
sets
in
at
or
none
the
less
he
remembered
to
hold
himself
lowly
when
tales
were
told
of
hot
nights
kim
did
not
sweep
the
board
with
his
reminiscences
for
st
xavier
looks
down
on
boys
who
native
one
must
never
forget
that
one
is
a
sahib
and
that
some
day
when
examinations
are
passed
one
will
command
natives
kim
made
a
note
of
this
for
he
began
to
understand
where
examinations
led
then
came
the
holidays
from
august
to
october
the
long
holidays
imposed
by
the
heat
and
the
rains
kim
was
informed
that
he
would
go
north
to
some
station
in
the
hills
behind
umballa
where
father
victor
would
arrange
for
him
said
kim
who
had
asked
many
questions
and
thought
more
i
suppose
so
said
the
master
will
not
do
you
any
harm
to
keep
you
out
of
mischief
you
can
go
up
with
young
de
castro
as
far
as
delhi
kim
considered
it
in
every
possible
light
he
had
been
diligent
even
as
the
colonel
advised
a
boy
holiday
was
his
own
property
of
so
much
the
talk
of
his
companions
had
advised
him
and
a
would
be
torment
after
st
xavier
moreover
this
was
magic
worth
anything
else
he
could
write
in
three
months
he
had
discovered
how
men
can
speak
to
each
other
without
a
third
party
at
the
cost
of
half
an
anna
and
a
little
knowledge
no
word
had
come
from
the
lama
but
there
remained
the
road
kim
yearned
for
the
caress
of
soft
mud
squishing
up
between
the
toes
as
his
mouth
watered
for
mutton
stewed
with
butter
and
cabbages
for
rice
speckled
with
strong
scented
cardamoms
for
the
rice
garlic
and
onions
and
the
forbidden
greasy
sweetmeats
of
the
bazars
they
would
feed
him
raw
beef
on
a
platter
at
the
and
he
must
smoke
by
stealth
but
again
he
was
a
sahib
and
was
at
st
xavier
and
that
pig
mahbub
ali
no
he
would
not
test
mahbub
hospitality
and
yet
he
thought
it
out
alone
in
the
dormitory
and
came
to
the
conclusion
he
had
been
unjust
to
mahbub
the
school
was
empty
nearly
all
the
masters
had
gone
away
colonel
creighton
railway
pass
lay
in
his
hand
and
kim
puffed
himself
that
he
had
not
spent
colonel
creighton
or
mahbub
money
in
riotous
living
he
was
still
lord
of
two
rupees
seven
annas
his
new
marked
and
lay
in
the
empty
are
always
tied
to
their
baggage
said
kim
nodding
at
them
will
stay
here
he
went
out
into
the
warm
rain
smiling
sinfully
and
sought
a
certain
house
whose
outside
he
had
noted
down
some
time
before
dost
thou
know
what
manner
of
women
we
be
in
this
quarter
oh
shame
i
born
yesterday
kim
squatted
on
the
cushions
of
that
upper
room
little
dyestuff
and
three
yards
of
cloth
to
help
out
a
jest
is
it
much
to
ask
is
she
thou
art
full
young
as
sahibs
go
for
this
devilry
she
she
is
the
daughter
of
a
certain
schoolmaster
of
a
regiment
in
the
cantonments
he
has
beaten
me
twice
because
i
went
over
their
wall
in
these
clothes
now
i
would
go
as
a
gardener
boy
old
men
are
very
jealous
is
true
hold
thy
face
still
while
i
dab
on
the
juice
too
black
naikan
i
would
not
appear
to
her
as
a
hubshi
nigger
love
makes
nought
of
these
things
and
how
old
is
she
years
i
think
said
the
shameless
kim
it
also
on
the
breast
it
may
be
her
father
will
tear
my
clothes
off
me
and
if
i
am
piebald
he
laughed
the
girl
worked
busily
dabbing
a
twist
of
cloth
into
a
little
saucer
of
brown
dye
that
holds
longer
than
any
send
out
and
get
me
a
cloth
for
the
turban
woe
is
me
my
head
is
all
unshaved
and
he
will
surely
knock
off
my
turban
am
not
a
barber
but
i
will
make
shift
thou
wast
born
to
be
a
breaker
of
hearts
all
this
disguise
for
one
evening
remember
the
stuff
does
not
wash
away
she
shook
with
laughter
till
her
bracelets
and
anklets
jingled
who
is
to
pay
me
for
this
huneefa
herself
could
not
have
given
thee
better
stuff
in
the
gods
my
sister
said
kim
gravely
screwing
his
face
round
as
the
stain
dried
hast
thou
ever
helped
to
paint
a
sahib
thus
before
indeed
but
a
jest
is
not
money
is
worth
much
more
thou
art
beyond
all
dispute
the
most
shameless
son
of
shaitan
that
i
have
ever
known
to
take
up
a
poor
girl
time
with
this
play
and
then
to
say
is
not
the
jest
enough
thou
wilt
go
very
far
in
this
world
she
gave
the
salutation
in
mockery
one
make
haste
and
my
head
kim
shifted
from
foot
to
foot
his
eyes
ablaze
with
mirth
as
he
thought
of
the
fat
days
before
him
he
gave
the
girl
four
annas
and
ran
down
the
stairs
in
the
likeness
of
a
hindu
boy
perfect
in
every
detail
a
cookshop
was
his
next
point
of
call
where
he
feasted
in
extravagance
and
greasy
luxury
on
lucknow
station
platform
he
watched
young
de
castro
all
covered
with
get
into
a
compartment
kim
patronized
a
third
and
was
the
life
and
soul
of
it
he
explained
to
the
company
that
he
was
assistant
to
a
juggler
who
had
left
him
behind
sick
with
fever
and
that
he
would
pick
up
his
master
at
umballa
as
the
occupants
of
the
carriage
changed
he
varied
this
tale
or
adorned
it
with
all
the
shoots
of
a
budding
fancy
the
more
rampant
for
being
held
off
native
speech
so
long
in
all
india
that
night
was
no
human
being
so
joyful
as
kim
at
umballa
he
got
out
and
headed
eastward
plashing
over
the
sodden
fields
to
the
village
where
the
old
soldier
lived
about
this
time
colonel
creighton
at
simla
was
advised
from
lucknow
by
wire
that
young
had
disappeared
mahbub
ali
was
in
town
selling
horses
and
to
him
the
colonel
confided
the
affair
one
morning
cantering
round
annandale
racecourse
that
is
nothing
said
the
are
like
horses
at
certain
times
they
need
salt
and
if
that
salt
is
not
in
the
mangers
they
will
lick
it
up
from
the
earth
he
has
gone
back
to
the
road
again
for
a
while
the
madrissak
wearied
him
i
knew
it
would
another
time
i
will
take
him
upon
the
road
myself
do
not
be
troubled
creighton
sahib
it
is
as
though
a
breaking
loose
ran
out
to
learn
the
game
alone
he
is
not
dead
think
you
might
kill
him
i
do
not
fear
for
the
boy
otherwise
a
monkey
does
not
fall
among
trees
next
morning
on
the
same
course
mahbub
stallion
ranged
alongside
the
colonel
is
as
i
had
thought
said
the
has
come
through
umballa
at
least
and
there
he
has
written
a
letter
to
me
having
learned
in
the
bazar
that
i
was
here
said
the
colonel
with
a
sigh
of
relief
it
was
absurd
that
a
man
of
his
position
should
take
an
interest
in
a
little
vagabond
but
the
colonel
remembered
the
conversation
in
the
train
and
often
in
the
past
few
months
had
caught
himself
thinking
of
the
queer
silent
boy
his
evasion
of
course
was
the
height
of
insolence
but
it
argued
some
resource
and
nerve
mahbub
eyes
twinkled
as
he
reined
out
into
the
centre
of
the
cramped
little
plain
where
none
could
come
near
unseen
the
friend
of
the
stars
who
is
the
friend
of
all
the
world
is
this
name
we
give
him
in
lahore
city
the
friend
of
all
the
world
takes
leave
to
go
to
his
own
places
he
will
come
back
upon
the
appointed
day
let
the
box
and
the
be
sent
for
and
if
there
has
been
a
fault
let
the
hand
of
friendship
turn
aside
the
whip
of
calamity
there
is
yet
a
little
more
but
matter
read
certain
things
are
not
known
to
those
who
eat
with
forks
it
is
better
to
eat
with
both
hands
for
a
while
speak
soft
words
to
those
who
do
not
understand
this
that
the
return
may
be
propitious
now
the
manner
in
which
that
was
cast
is
of
course
the
work
of
the
but
see
how
wisely
the
boy
has
devised
the
matter
of
it
so
that
no
hint
is
given
except
to
those
who
know
this
the
hand
of
friendship
to
avert
the
whip
of
calamity
laughed
the
colonel
how
wise
is
the
boy
he
would
go
back
to
the
road
again
as
i
said
not
knowing
yet
thy
trade
am
not
at
all
sure
of
that
the
colonel
muttered
turns
to
me
to
make
a
peace
between
you
is
he
not
wise
he
says
he
will
return
he
is
but
perfecting
his
knowledge
think
sahib
he
has
been
three
months
at
the
school
and
he
is
not
mouthed
to
that
bit
for
my
part
i
rejoice
the
pony
learns
the
game
but
another
time
he
must
not
go
alone
he
went
alone
before
he
came
under
the
colonel
protection
when
he
comes
to
the
great
game
he
must
go
alone
alone
and
at
peril
of
his
head
then
if
he
spits
or
sneezes
or
sits
down
other
than
as
the
people
do
whom
he
watches
he
may
be
slain
why
hinder
him
now
remember
how
the
persians
say
the
jackal
that
lives
in
the
wilds
of
mazanderan
can
only
be
caught
by
the
hounds
of
mazanderan
it
is
true
mahbub
ali
and
if
he
comes
to
no
harm
i
do
not
desire
anything
better
but
it
is
great
insolence
on
his
part
does
not
tell
me
even
whither
he
goes
said
mahbub
is
no
fool
when
his
time
is
accomplished
he
will
come
to
me
it
is
time
the
healer
of
pearls
took
him
in
hand
he
ripens
too
quickly
as
sahibs
reckon
this
prophecy
was
fulfilled
to
the
letter
a
month
later
mahbub
had
gone
down
to
umballa
to
bring
up
a
fresh
consignment
of
horses
and
kim
met
him
on
the
kalka
road
at
dusk
riding
alone
begged
an
alms
of
him
was
sworn
at
and
replied
in
english
there
was
nobody
within
earshot
to
hear
mahbub
gasp
of
amazement
and
where
hast
thou
been
and
down
down
and
up
under
a
tree
out
of
the
wet
and
tell
stayed
for
a
while
with
an
old
man
near
umballa
anon
with
a
household
of
my
acquaintance
in
umballa
with
one
of
these
i
went
as
far
as
delhi
to
the
southward
that
is
a
wondrous
city
then
i
drove
a
bullock
for
a
teli
an
oilman
coming
north
but
i
heard
of
a
great
feast
forward
in
patiala
and
thither
went
i
in
the
company
of
a
it
was
a
great
feast
kim
rubbed
his
stomach
saw
rajahs
and
elephants
with
gold
and
silver
trappings
and
they
lit
all
the
fireworks
at
once
whereby
eleven
men
were
killed
my
among
them
and
i
was
blown
across
a
tent
but
took
no
harm
then
i
came
back
to
the
rel
with
a
sikh
horseman
to
whom
i
was
groom
for
my
bread
and
so
here
said
mahbub
ali
what
does
the
colonel
sahib
say
i
do
not
wish
to
be
beaten
hand
of
friendship
has
averted
the
whip
of
calamity
but
another
time
when
thou
takest
the
road
it
will
be
with
me
this
is
too
early
enough
for
me
i
have
learned
to
read
and
to
write
english
a
little
at
the
madrissah
i
shall
soon
be
altogether
a
sahib
him
laughed
mahbub
looking
at
the
little
drenched
figure
dancing
in
the
wet
sahib
and
he
saluted
ironically
art
tired
of
the
road
or
wilt
thou
come
on
to
umballa
with
me
and
work
back
with
the
horses
come
with
thee
mahbub
ali
chapter
something
i
owe
to
the
soil
that
grew
more
to
the
life
that
fed
but
most
to
allah
who
gave
me
two
separate
sides
to
my
head
i
would
go
without
shirts
or
shoes
friends
tobacco
or
bread
sooner
than
for
an
instant
lose
either
side
of
my
head
the
man
in
god
name
take
blue
for
red
said
mahbub
alluding
to
the
hindu
colour
of
kim
disreputable
turban
kim
countered
with
the
old
proverb
will
change
my
faith
and
my
bedding
but
thou
must
pay
for
it
the
dealer
laughed
till
he
nearly
fell
from
his
horse
at
a
shop
on
the
outskirts
of
the
city
the
change
was
made
and
kim
stood
up
externally
at
least
a
mohammedan
mahbub
hired
a
room
over
against
the
railway
station
sent
for
a
cooked
meal
of
the
finest
with
the
balushai
we
call
it
and
lucknow
tobacco
is
better
than
some
other
meat
that
i
ate
with
the
sikh
said
kim
grinning
as
he
squatted
assuredly
they
give
no
such
victuals
at
my
madrissah
have
a
desire
to
hear
of
that
same
madrissah
mahbub
stuffed
himself
with
great
boluses
of
spiced
mutton
fried
in
fat
with
cabbage
and
onions
tell
me
first
altogether
and
truthfully
the
manner
of
thy
escape
for
o
friend
of
all
the
world
he
loosed
his
cracking
belt
do
not
think
it
is
often
that
a
sahib
and
the
son
of
a
sahib
runs
away
from
there
should
they
they
do
not
know
the
land
it
was
nothing
said
kim
and
began
his
tale
when
he
came
to
the
disguisement
and
the
interview
with
the
girl
in
the
bazar
mahbub
ali
gravity
went
from
him
he
laughed
aloud
and
beat
his
hand
on
his
thigh
shabash
oh
well
done
little
one
what
will
the
healer
of
turquoises
say
to
this
now
slowly
let
us
hear
what
befell
afterwards
step
by
step
omitting
nothing
step
by
step
then
kim
told
his
adventures
between
coughs
as
the
tobacco
caught
his
lungs
said
growled
mahbub
ali
to
himself
said
it
was
the
pony
breaking
out
to
play
polo
the
fruit
is
ripe
already
except
that
he
must
learn
his
distances
and
his
pacings
and
his
rods
and
his
compasses
listen
now
i
have
turned
aside
the
colonel
whip
from
thy
skin
and
that
is
no
small
service
kim
pulled
serenely
is
true
it
is
not
to
be
thought
that
this
running
out
and
in
is
any
way
good
was
my
holiday
hajji
i
was
a
slave
for
many
weeks
why
should
i
not
run
away
when
the
school
was
shut
look
too
how
i
living
upon
my
friends
or
working
for
my
bread
as
i
did
with
the
sikh
have
saved
the
colonel
sahib
a
great
expense
mahbub
lips
twitched
under
his
mohammedan
moustache
are
a
few
rupees
the
pathan
threw
out
his
open
hand
carelessly
the
colonel
sahib
he
spends
them
for
a
purpose
not
in
any
way
for
love
of
thee
said
kim
slowly
knew
a
very
long
time
ago
told
colonel
sahib
himself
not
in
those
many
words
but
plainly
enough
for
one
who
is
not
altogether
a
yea
he
told
me
in
the
when
we
went
down
to
lucknow
it
so
then
i
will
tell
thee
more
friend
of
all
the
world
though
in
the
telling
i
lend
thee
my
head
was
forfeit
to
me
said
kim
with
deep
relish
umballa
when
thou
didst
pick
me
up
on
the
horse
after
the
beat
me
a
little
plainer
all
the
world
may
tell
lies
save
thou
and
i
for
equally
is
thy
life
forfeit
to
me
if
i
chose
to
raise
my
finger
here
this
is
known
to
me
also
said
kim
readjusting
the
live
on
the
weed
is
a
very
sure
tie
between
us
indeed
thy
hold
is
surer
even
than
mine
for
who
would
miss
a
boy
beaten
to
death
or
it
may
be
thrown
into
a
well
by
the
roadside
most
people
here
and
in
simla
and
across
the
passes
behind
the
hills
would
on
the
other
hand
say
what
has
come
to
mahbub
ali
if
he
were
found
dead
among
his
horses
surely
too
the
colonel
sahib
would
make
inquiries
but
again
kim
face
puckered
with
cunning
would
not
make
overlong
inquiry
lest
people
should
ask
what
has
this
colonel
sahib
to
do
with
that
but
i
if
i
lived
thou
wouldst
surely
die
but
i
say
if
i
lived
i
and
i
alone
would
know
that
one
had
come
by
night
as
a
common
thief
perhaps
to
mahbub
ali
bulkhead
in
the
serai
and
there
had
slain
him
either
before
or
after
that
thief
had
made
a
full
search
into
his
saddlebags
and
between
the
soles
of
his
slippers
is
that
news
to
tell
to
the
colonel
or
would
he
say
to
me
i
have
not
forgotten
when
he
sent
me
back
for
a
that
he
had
not
left
behind
him
what
is
mahbub
ali
to
me
up
went
a
gout
of
heavy
smoke
there
was
a
long
pause
then
mahbub
ali
spoke
in
admiration
with
these
things
on
thy
mind
dost
thou
lie
down
and
rise
again
among
all
the
sahibs
little
sons
at
the
madrissah
and
meekly
take
instruction
from
thy
teachers
is
an
order
said
kim
blandly
am
i
to
dispute
an
order
most
finished
son
of
eblis
said
mahbub
ali
what
is
this
tale
of
the
thief
and
the
search
which
i
saw
said
kim
night
that
my
lama
and
i
lay
next
thy
place
in
the
kashmir
seral
the
door
was
left
unlocked
which
i
think
is
not
thy
custom
mahbub
he
came
in
as
one
assured
that
thou
wouldst
not
soon
return
my
eye
was
against
a
in
the
plank
he
searched
as
it
were
for
something
not
a
rug
not
stirrups
nor
a
bridle
nor
brass
pots
something
little
and
most
carefully
hid
else
why
did
he
prick
with
an
iron
between
the
soles
of
thy
slippers
mahbub
ali
smiled
gently
seeing
these
things
what
tale
didst
thou
fashion
to
thyself
well
of
the
truth
i
put
my
hand
upon
my
amulet
which
lies
always
next
to
my
skin
and
remembering
the
pedigree
of
a
white
stallion
that
i
had
bitten
out
of
a
piece
of
mussalmani
bread
i
went
away
to
umballa
perceiving
that
a
heavy
trust
was
laid
upon
me
at
that
hour
had
i
chosen
thy
head
was
forfeit
it
needed
only
to
say
to
that
man
i
have
here
a
paper
concerning
a
horse
which
i
can
not
read
and
then
kim
peered
at
mahbub
under
his
eyebrows
thou
wouldst
have
drunk
water
twice
perhaps
thrice
afterwards
i
do
not
think
more
than
thrice
said
mahbub
simply
is
true
i
thought
of
that
a
little
but
most
i
thought
that
i
loved
thee
mahbub
therefore
i
went
to
umballa
as
thou
knowest
but
and
this
thou
dost
not
know
i
lay
hid
in
the
to
see
what
colonel
creighton
sahib
might
do
upon
reading
the
white
pedigree
what
did
he
for
kim
had
bitten
off
the
conversation
thou
give
news
for
love
or
dost
thou
sell
it
kim
asked
sell
and
i
buy
mahbub
took
a
piece
out
of
his
belt
and
held
it
up
said
kim
mechanically
following
the
huckster
instinct
of
the
east
mahbub
laughed
and
put
away
the
coin
is
too
easy
to
deal
in
that
market
friend
of
all
the
world
tell
me
for
love
our
lives
lie
in
each
other
hand
good
i
saw
the
sahib
the
come
to
a
big
dinner
i
saw
him
in
creighton
sahib
office
i
saw
the
two
read
the
white
stallion
pedigree
i
heard
the
very
orders
given
for
the
opening
of
a
great
war
mahbub
nodded
with
deepest
eyes
afire
game
is
well
played
that
war
is
done
now
and
the
evil
we
hope
nipped
before
the
flower
thanks
to
me
and
thee
what
didst
thou
later
made
the
news
as
it
were
a
hook
to
catch
me
victual
and
honour
among
the
villagers
in
a
village
whose
priest
drugged
my
lama
but
i
bore
away
the
old
man
purse
and
the
brahmin
found
nothing
so
next
morning
he
was
angry
ho
ho
and
i
also
used
the
news
when
i
fell
into
the
hands
of
that
white
regiment
with
their
bull
was
foolishness
mahbub
scowled
is
not
meant
to
be
thrown
about
like
but
used
sparingly
like
bhang
i
think
now
and
moreover
it
did
me
no
sort
of
good
but
that
was
very
long
ago
he
made
as
to
brush
it
all
away
with
a
thin
brown
hand
since
then
and
especially
in
the
nights
under
the
punkah
at
the
madrissah
i
have
thought
very
greatly
it
permitted
to
ask
whither
the
thought
might
have
led
said
mahbub
with
an
elaborate
sarcasm
smoothing
his
scarlet
beard
is
permitted
said
kim
and
threw
back
the
very
tone
say
at
nucklao
that
no
sahib
must
tell
a
black
man
that
he
has
made
a
fault
mahbub
hand
shot
into
his
bosom
for
to
call
a
pathan
a
kala
admi
is
a
then
he
remembered
and
laughed
sahib
thy
black
man
hears
said
kim
am
not
a
sahib
and
i
say
i
made
a
fault
to
curse
thee
mahbub
ali
on
that
day
at
umballa
when
i
thought
i
was
betrayed
by
a
pathan
i
was
senseless
for
i
was
but
newly
caught
and
i
wished
to
kill
that
i
say
now
hajji
that
it
was
well
done
and
i
see
my
road
all
clear
before
me
to
a
good
service
i
will
stay
in
the
madrissah
till
i
am
ripe
said
especially
are
distances
and
numbers
and
the
manner
of
using
compasses
to
be
learned
in
that
game
one
waits
in
the
hills
above
to
show
thee
will
learn
their
teaching
upon
a
condition
that
my
time
is
given
to
me
without
question
when
the
madrissah
is
shut
ask
that
for
me
of
the
colonel
why
not
ask
the
colonel
in
the
sahibs
tongue
colonel
is
the
servant
of
the
government
he
is
sent
hither
and
yon
at
a
word
and
must
consider
his
own
advancement
see
how
much
i
have
already
learned
at
nucklao
moreover
the
colonel
i
know
since
three
months
only
i
have
known
one
mahbub
ali
for
six
years
so
to
the
madrissah
i
will
go
at
the
madrissah
i
will
learn
in
the
madrissah
i
will
be
a
sahib
but
when
the
madrissah
is
shut
then
must
i
be
free
and
go
among
my
people
otherwise
i
die
who
are
thy
people
friend
of
all
the
world
great
and
beautiful
land
said
kim
waving
his
paw
round
the
little
room
where
the
in
its
niche
burned
heavily
through
the
further
i
would
see
my
lama
again
and
further
i
need
money
is
the
need
of
everyone
said
mahbub
ruefully
will
give
thee
eight
annas
for
much
money
is
not
picked
out
of
horses
hooves
and
it
must
suffice
for
many
days
as
to
all
the
rest
i
am
well
pleased
and
no
further
talk
is
needed
make
haste
to
learn
and
in
three
years
or
it
may
be
less
thou
wilt
be
an
aid
even
to
me
i
been
such
a
hindrance
till
now
said
kim
with
a
boy
giggle
not
give
answers
mahbub
grunted
art
my
new
go
and
bed
among
my
men
they
are
near
the
north
end
of
the
station
with
the
horses
will
beat
me
to
the
south
end
of
the
station
if
i
come
without
authority
mahbub
felt
in
his
belt
wetted
his
thumb
on
a
cake
of
chinese
ink
and
dabbed
the
impression
on
a
piece
of
soft
native
paper
from
balkh
to
bombay
men
know
that
print
with
the
old
scar
running
diagonally
across
it
is
enough
to
show
my
headman
i
come
in
the
morning
which
road
said
kim
the
road
from
the
city
there
is
but
one
and
then
we
return
to
creighton
sahib
i
have
saved
thee
a
beating
what
is
a
beating
when
the
very
head
is
loose
on
the
shoulders
kim
slid
out
quietly
into
the
night
walked
half
round
the
house
keeping
close
to
the
walls
and
headed
away
from
the
station
for
a
mile
or
so
then
fetching
a
wide
compass
he
worked
back
at
leisure
for
he
needed
time
to
invent
a
story
if
any
of
mahbub
retainers
asked
questions
they
were
camped
on
a
piece
of
waste
ground
beside
the
railway
and
being
natives
had
not
of
course
unloaded
the
two
trucks
in
which
mahbub
animals
stood
among
a
consignment
of
bought
by
the
bombay
the
headman
a
mohammedan
promptly
challenged
kim
but
was
pacified
at
sight
of
mahbub
hajji
has
of
his
favour
given
me
service
said
kim
testily
this
be
doubted
wait
till
he
comes
in
the
morning
meantime
a
place
by
the
fire
followed
the
usual
aimless
babble
that
every
native
must
raise
on
every
occasion
it
died
down
and
kim
lay
out
behind
the
little
knot
of
mahbub
followers
almost
under
the
wheels
of
a
a
borrowed
blanket
for
covering
now
a
bed
among
brickbats
and
on
a
damp
night
between
overcrowded
horses
and
unwashed
baltis
would
not
appeal
to
many
white
boys
but
kim
was
utterly
happy
change
of
scene
service
and
surroundings
were
the
breath
of
his
little
nostrils
and
thinking
of
the
neat
white
cots
of
st
xavier
all
arow
under
the
punkah
gave
him
joy
as
keen
as
the
repetition
of
the
in
english
am
very
old
he
thought
sleepily
month
i
become
a
year
more
old
i
was
very
young
and
a
fool
to
boot
when
i
took
message
to
umballa
even
when
i
was
with
that
white
regiment
i
was
very
young
and
small
and
had
no
wisdom
but
now
i
learn
every
day
and
in
three
years
the
colonel
will
take
me
out
of
the
madrissah
and
let
me
go
upon
the
road
with
mahbub
hunting
for
horses
pedigrees
or
maybe
i
shall
go
by
myself
or
maybe
i
shall
find
the
lama
and
go
with
him
yes
that
is
best
to
walk
again
as
a
chela
with
my
lama
when
he
comes
back
to
benares
the
thoughts
came
more
slowly
and
disconnectedly
he
was
plunging
into
a
beautiful
dreamland
when
his
ears
caught
a
whisper
thin
and
sharp
above
the
monotonous
babble
round
the
fire
it
came
from
behind
the
is
not
here
then
should
he
be
but
roystering
in
the
city
who
looks
for
a
rat
in
a
come
away
he
is
not
our
man
must
not
go
back
beyond
the
passes
a
second
time
it
is
the
order
some
woman
to
drug
him
it
is
a
few
rupees
only
and
there
is
no
evidence
the
woman
it
must
be
more
certain
and
remember
the
price
upon
his
head
but
the
police
have
a
long
arm
and
we
are
far
from
the
border
if
it
were
in
peshawur
now
in
peshawur
the
second
voice
sneered
full
of
his
full
of
and
women
behind
whose
clothes
he
will
hide
yes
peshawur
or
jehannum
would
suit
us
equally
well
what
is
the
plan
fool
have
i
not
told
it
a
hundred
times
wait
till
he
comes
to
lie
down
and
then
one
sure
shot
the
trucks
are
between
us
and
pursuit
we
have
but
to
run
back
over
the
lines
and
go
our
way
they
will
not
see
whence
the
shot
came
wait
here
at
least
till
the
dawn
what
manner
of
fakir
art
thou
to
shiver
at
a
little
watching
thought
kim
behind
eyes
again
it
is
mahbub
indeed
a
white
stallion
pedigree
is
not
a
good
thing
to
peddle
to
sahibs
or
maybe
mahbub
has
been
selling
other
news
now
what
is
to
do
kim
i
know
not
where
mahbub
houses
and
if
he
comes
here
before
the
dawn
they
will
shoot
him
that
would
be
no
profit
for
thee
kim
and
this
is
not
a
matter
for
the
police
that
would
be
no
profit
for
mahbub
and
he
giggled
almost
aloud
do
not
remember
any
lesson
at
nucklao
which
will
help
me
allah
here
is
kim
and
yonder
are
they
first
then
kim
must
wake
and
go
away
so
that
they
shall
not
suspect
a
bad
dream
wakes
a
man
thus
he
threw
the
blanket
off
his
face
and
raised
himself
suddenly
with
the
terrible
bubbling
meaningless
yell
of
the
asiatic
roused
by
nightmare
narain
the
churel
the
churel
a
churel
is
the
peculiarly
malignant
ghost
of
a
woman
who
has
died
in
she
haunts
lonely
roads
her
feet
are
turned
backwards
on
the
ankles
and
she
leads
men
to
torment
louder
rose
kim
quavering
howl
till
at
last
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
staggered
off
sleepily
while
the
camp
cursed
him
for
waking
them
some
twenty
yards
farther
up
the
line
he
lay
down
again
taking
care
that
the
whisperers
should
hear
his
grunts
and
groans
as
he
recomposed
himself
after
a
few
minutes
he
rolled
towards
the
road
and
stole
away
into
the
thick
darkness
he
paddled
along
swiftly
till
he
came
to
a
culvert
and
dropped
behind
it
his
chin
on
a
level
with
the
here
he
could
command
all
the
himself
unseen
two
or
three
carts
passed
jingling
out
to
the
suburbs
a
coughing
policeman
and
a
hurrying
or
two
who
sang
to
keep
off
evil
spirits
then
rapped
the
shod
feet
of
a
horse
this
is
more
like
mahbub
thought
kim
as
the
beast
shied
at
the
little
head
above
the
culvert
mahbub
ali
he
whispered
a
care
the
horse
was
reined
back
almost
on
its
haunches
and
forced
towards
the
culvert
again
said
mahbub
i
take
a
shod
horse
for
they
pick
up
all
the
bones
and
nails
in
the
city
he
stooped
to
lift
its
forefoot
and
that
brought
his
head
within
a
foot
of
kim
keep
down
he
muttered
night
is
full
of
eyes
men
wait
thy
coming
behind
the
they
will
shoot
thee
at
thy
lying
down
because
there
is
a
price
on
thy
head
i
heard
sleeping
near
the
horses
thou
see
them
hold
still
sire
of
devils
this
furiously
to
the
horse
one
dressed
belike
as
a
fakir
said
to
the
other
what
manner
of
fakir
art
thou
to
shiver
at
a
little
watching
go
back
to
the
camp
and
lie
down
i
do
not
die
tonight
mahbub
wheeled
his
horse
and
vanished
kim
tore
back
down
the
ditch
till
he
reached
a
point
opposite
his
second
slipped
across
the
road
like
a
weasel
and
himself
in
the
blanket
least
mahbub
knows
he
thought
contentedly
certainly
he
spoke
as
one
expecting
it
i
do
not
think
those
two
men
will
profit
by
tonight
watch
an
hour
passed
and
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
to
keep
awake
all
night
he
slept
deeply
now
and
again
a
night
train
roared
along
the
metals
within
twenty
feet
of
him
but
he
had
all
the
indifference
to
mere
noise
and
it
did
not
even
weave
a
dream
through
his
slumber
mahbub
was
anything
but
asleep
it
annoyed
him
vehemently
that
people
outside
his
tribe
and
unaffected
by
his
casual
amours
should
pursue
him
for
the
life
his
first
and
natural
impulse
was
to
cross
the
line
lower
down
work
up
again
and
catching
his
from
behind
summarily
slay
them
here
he
reflected
with
sorrow
another
branch
of
the
government
totally
unconnected
with
colonel
creighton
might
demand
explanations
which
would
be
hard
to
supply
and
he
knew
that
south
of
the
border
a
perfectly
ridiculous
fuss
is
made
about
a
corpse
or
so
he
had
not
been
troubled
in
this
way
since
he
sent
kim
to
umballa
with
the
message
and
hoped
that
suspicion
had
been
finally
diverted
then
a
most
brilliant
notion
struck
him
english
do
eternally
tell
the
truth
he
said
we
of
this
country
are
eternally
made
foolish
by
allah
i
will
tell
the
truth
to
an
englishman
of
what
use
is
the
government
police
if
a
poor
kabuli
be
robbed
of
his
horses
in
their
very
trucks
this
is
as
bad
as
peshawur
i
should
lay
a
complaint
at
the
station
better
still
some
young
sahib
on
the
railway
they
are
zealous
and
if
they
catch
thieves
it
is
remembered
to
their
honour
he
tied
up
his
horse
outside
the
station
and
strode
on
to
the
platform
mahbub
ali
said
a
young
assistant
district
traffic
superintendent
who
was
waiting
to
go
down
the
line
a
tall
horsey
youth
in
dingy
white
linen
are
you
doing
here
selling
weeds
eh
i
am
not
troubled
for
my
horses
i
come
to
look
for
lutuf
ullah
i
have
a
up
the
line
could
anyone
take
them
out
without
the
railway
knowledge
think
so
mahbub
you
can
claim
against
us
if
they
do
have
seen
two
men
crouching
under
the
wheels
of
one
of
the
trucks
nearly
all
night
fakirs
do
not
steal
horses
so
i
gave
them
no
more
thought
i
would
find
lutuf
ullah
my
partner
deuce
you
did
and
you
did
bother
your
head
about
it
my
word
it
just
almost
as
well
that
i
met
you
what
were
they
like
eh
were
only
fakirs
they
will
no
more
than
take
a
little
grain
perhaps
from
one
of
the
trucks
there
are
many
up
the
line
the
state
will
never
miss
the
dole
i
came
here
seeking
for
my
partner
lutuf
ullah
mind
your
partner
where
are
your
little
to
this
side
of
the
farthest
place
where
they
make
lamps
for
the
trains
yes
upon
the
rail
nearest
to
the
road
upon
the
side
looking
up
the
line
thus
but
as
regards
lutuf
ullah
a
tall
man
with
a
broken
nose
and
a
persian
greyhound
aie
the
boy
had
hurried
off
to
wake
up
a
young
and
enthusiastic
policeman
for
as
he
said
the
railway
had
suffered
much
from
depredations
in
the
mahbub
ali
chuckled
in
his
dyed
beard
will
walk
in
their
boots
making
a
noise
and
then
they
will
wonder
why
there
are
no
fakirs
they
are
very
clever
boys
barton
sahib
and
young
sahib
he
waited
idly
for
a
few
minutes
expecting
to
see
them
hurry
up
the
line
girt
for
action
a
light
engine
slid
through
the
station
and
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
young
barton
in
the
cab
did
that
child
an
injustice
he
is
not
altogether
a
fool
said
mahbub
ali
take
a
for
a
thief
is
a
new
game
when
mahbub
ali
came
to
his
camp
in
the
dawn
no
one
thought
it
worth
while
to
tell
him
any
news
of
the
night
no
one
at
least
but
one
small
horseboy
newly
advanced
to
the
great
man
service
whom
mahbub
called
to
his
tiny
tent
to
assist
in
some
packing
is
all
known
to
me
whispered
kim
bending
above
saddlebags
sahibs
came
up
on
a
i
was
running
to
and
fro
in
the
dark
on
this
side
of
the
trucks
as
the
moved
up
and
down
slowly
they
fell
upon
two
men
sitting
under
this
truck
hajji
what
shall
i
do
with
this
lump
of
tobacco
wrap
it
in
paper
and
put
it
under
the
yes
and
struck
them
down
but
one
man
struck
at
a
sahib
with
a
fakir
buck
horn
kim
meant
the
conjoined
horns
which
are
a
fakir
sole
temporal
weapon
blood
came
so
the
other
sahib
first
smiting
his
own
man
senseless
smote
the
stabber
with
a
short
gun
which
had
rolled
from
the
first
man
hand
they
all
raged
as
though
mad
together
mahbub
smiled
with
heavenly
resignation
that
is
not
so
much
dewanee
madness
or
a
case
for
the
civil
court
the
word
can
be
punned
upon
both
ways
as
nizamut
a
criminal
case
a
gun
sayest
thou
ten
good
years
in
jail
they
both
lay
still
but
i
think
they
were
nearly
dead
when
they
were
put
on
the
their
heads
moved
thus
and
there
is
much
blood
on
the
line
come
and
see
have
seen
blood
before
jail
is
the
sure
place
and
assuredly
they
will
give
false
names
and
assuredly
no
man
will
find
them
for
a
long
time
they
were
unfriends
of
mine
thy
fate
and
mine
seem
on
one
string
what
a
tale
for
the
healer
of
pearls
now
swiftly
with
the
and
the
we
will
take
out
the
horses
and
away
to
simla
swiftly
as
orientals
understand
speed
with
long
explanations
with
abuse
and
windy
talk
carelessly
amid
a
hundred
checks
for
little
things
forgotten
the
untidy
camp
broke
up
and
led
the
stiff
and
fretful
horses
along
the
kalka
road
in
the
fresh
of
the
dawn
kim
regarded
as
mahbub
ali
favourite
by
all
who
wished
to
stand
well
with
the
pathan
was
not
called
upon
to
work
they
strolled
on
by
the
easiest
of
stages
halting
every
few
hours
at
a
wayside
shelter
very
many
sahibs
travel
along
the
kalka
road
and
as
mahbub
ali
says
every
young
sahib
must
needs
esteem
himself
a
judge
of
a
horse
and
though
he
be
over
head
in
debt
to
the
must
make
as
if
to
buy
that
was
the
reason
that
sahib
after
sahib
rolling
along
in
a
would
stop
and
open
talk
some
would
even
descend
from
their
vehicles
and
feel
the
horses
legs
asking
inane
questions
or
through
sheer
ignorance
of
the
vernacular
grossly
insulting
the
imperturbable
trader
first
i
dealt
with
sahibs
and
that
was
when
colonel
soady
sahib
was
governor
of
fort
abazai
and
flooded
the
for
spite
mahbub
confided
to
kim
as
the
boy
filled
his
pipe
under
a
tree
did
not
know
how
greatly
they
were
fools
and
this
made
me
wroth
as
thus
and
he
told
kim
a
tale
of
an
expression
misused
in
all
innocence
that
doubled
kim
up
with
mirth
i
see
however
he
exhaled
smoke
slowly
it
is
with
them
as
with
all
men
in
certain
matters
they
are
wise
and
in
others
most
foolish
very
foolish
it
is
to
use
the
wrong
word
to
a
stranger
for
though
the
heart
may
be
clean
of
offence
how
is
the
stranger
to
know
that
he
is
more
like
to
search
truth
with
a
dagger
true
talk
said
kim
solemnly
speak
of
a
cat
when
a
woman
is
brought
to
bed
for
instance
i
have
heard
them
in
one
situate
as
thou
art
it
particularly
behoves
thee
to
remember
this
with
both
kinds
of
faces
among
sahibs
never
forgetting
thou
art
a
sahib
among
the
folk
of
hind
always
remembering
thou
art
he
paused
with
a
puzzled
smile
am
i
mussalman
hindu
jain
or
buddhist
that
is
a
hard
knot
art
beyond
question
an
unbeliever
and
therefore
thou
wilt
be
damned
so
says
my
law
or
i
think
it
does
but
thou
art
also
my
little
friend
of
all
the
world
and
i
love
thee
so
says
my
heart
this
matter
of
creeds
is
like
horseflesh
the
wise
man
knows
horses
are
good
that
there
is
a
profit
to
be
made
from
all
and
for
myself
but
that
i
am
a
good
sunni
and
hate
the
men
of
tirah
i
could
believe
the
same
of
all
the
faiths
now
manifestly
a
kathiawar
mare
taken
from
the
sands
of
her
birthplace
and
removed
to
the
west
of
bengal
founders
nor
is
even
a
balkh
stallion
and
there
are
no
better
horses
than
those
of
balkh
were
they
not
so
heavy
in
the
shoulder
of
any
account
in
the
great
northern
deserts
beside
the
i
have
seen
therefore
i
say
in
my
heart
the
faiths
are
like
the
horses
each
has
merit
in
its
own
country
my
lama
said
altogether
a
different
thing
he
is
an
old
dreamer
of
dreams
from
bhotiyal
my
heart
is
a
little
angry
friend
of
all
the
world
that
thou
shouldst
see
such
worth
in
a
man
so
little
known
is
true
hajji
but
that
worth
do
i
see
and
to
him
my
heart
is
drawn
his
to
thine
i
hear
hearts
are
like
horses
they
come
and
they
go
against
bit
or
spur
shout
gul
sher
khan
yonder
to
drive
in
that
bay
stallion
pickets
more
firmly
we
do
not
want
a
at
every
and
the
dun
and
the
black
will
be
locked
in
a
little
now
hear
me
is
it
necessary
to
the
comfort
of
thy
heart
to
see
that
lama
is
one
part
of
my
bond
said
kim
i
do
not
see
him
and
if
he
is
taken
from
me
i
will
go
out
of
that
madrissah
in
nucklao
and
and
once
gone
who
is
to
find
me
again
is
true
never
was
colt
held
on
a
lighter
than
thou
mahbub
nodded
his
head
not
be
afraid
kim
spoke
as
though
he
could
have
vanished
on
the
moment
lama
has
said
that
he
will
come
to
see
me
at
the
madrissah
beggar
and
his
bowl
in
the
presence
of
those
young
sa
all
kim
cut
in
with
a
snort
eyes
are
blued
and
their
nails
are
blackened
with
blood
many
of
them
sons
of
mehteranees
to
the
bhungi
sweeper
we
need
not
follow
the
rest
of
the
pedigree
but
kim
made
his
little
point
clearly
and
without
heat
chewing
a
piece
of
the
while
of
all
the
world
said
mahbub
pushing
over
the
pipe
for
the
boy
to
clean
have
met
many
men
women
and
boys
and
not
a
few
sahibs
i
have
never
in
all
my
days
met
such
an
imp
as
thou
art
why
when
i
always
tell
thee
the
truth
the
very
reason
for
this
is
a
world
of
danger
to
honest
men
mahbub
ali
hauled
himself
off
the
ground
girt
in
his
belt
and
went
over
to
the
horses
sell
it
there
was
that
in
the
tone
that
made
mahbub
halt
and
turn
new
devilry
annas
and
i
will
tell
said
kim
grinning
touches
thy
peace
shaitan
mahbub
gave
the
money
thou
the
little
business
of
the
thieves
in
the
dark
down
yonder
at
umballa
they
sought
my
life
i
have
not
altogether
forgotten
why
thou
the
kashmir
serai
will
twist
thy
ears
in
a
moment
sahib
need
pathan
only
the
second
fakir
whom
the
sahibs
beat
senseless
was
the
man
who
came
to
search
thy
bulkhead
at
lahore
i
saw
his
face
as
they
helped
him
on
the
engine
the
very
same
man
didst
thou
not
tell
before
he
will
go
to
jail
and
be
safe
for
some
years
there
is
no
need
to
tell
more
than
is
necessary
at
any
one
time
besides
i
did
not
then
need
money
for
sweetmeats
kerim
said
mahbub
ah
thou
some
day
sell
my
head
for
a
few
sweetmeats
if
the
fit
takes
thee
kim
will
remember
till
he
dies
that
long
lazy
journey
from
umballa
through
kalka
and
the
pinjore
gardens
near
by
up
to
simla
a
sudden
spate
in
the
gugger
river
swept
down
one
horse
the
most
valuable
be
sure
and
nearly
drowned
kim
among
the
dancing
boulders
farther
up
the
road
the
horses
were
stampeded
by
a
government
elephant
and
being
in
high
condition
of
grass
food
it
cost
a
day
and
a
half
to
get
them
together
again
then
they
met
sikandar
khan
coming
down
with
a
few
unsaleable
screws
remnants
of
his
string
and
mahbub
who
has
more
of
in
his
little
fingernail
than
sikandar
khan
in
all
his
tents
must
needs
buy
two
of
the
worst
and
that
meant
eight
laborious
diplomacy
and
untold
tobacco
but
it
was
all
pure
delight
the
wandering
road
climbing
dipping
and
sweeping
about
the
growing
spurs
the
flush
of
the
morning
laid
along
the
distant
snows
the
branched
cacti
tier
upon
tier
on
the
stony
hillsides
the
voices
of
a
thousand
the
chatter
of
the
monkeys
the
solemn
deodars
climbing
one
after
another
with
branches
the
vista
of
the
plains
rolled
out
far
beneath
them
the
incessant
twanging
of
the
and
the
wild
rush
of
the
led
horses
when
a
tonga
swung
round
a
curve
the
halts
for
prayers
mahbub
was
very
religious
in
and
bellowings
when
time
did
not
press
the
evening
conferences
by
the
when
camels
and
bullocks
chewed
solemnly
together
and
the
stolid
drivers
told
the
news
of
the
road
all
these
things
lifted
kim
heart
to
song
within
him
when
the
singing
and
dancing
is
done
said
mahbub
ali
the
colonel
sahib
and
that
is
not
so
sweet
fair
land
a
most
beautiful
land
is
this
of
hind
and
the
land
of
the
five
rivers
is
fairer
than
all
kim
half
chanted
it
i
will
go
again
if
mahbub
ali
or
the
colonel
lift
hand
or
foot
against
me
once
gone
who
shall
find
me
look
hajji

yonder
the
city
of
simla
allah
what
a

and
he
was
an
old
man
when
mackerson
sahib
well
was
new
at
peshawur
could
recall
when
there
were
but
two
houses
in
it
he
led
the
horses
below
the
main
road
into
the
lower
simla
bazar
the
crowded
that
climbs
up
from
the
valley
to
the
town

an
angle

mahbub
ali
rented
a
room
much
more
securely
locked
than
his
bulkhead
at
lahore
in
the
house
of
a
mohammedan
it
was
a

so
soon
as

he
cast

the
answer

kim
shifted
his
speech
accordingly

together
they
set
off
through
the
mysterious
dusk
full
of
the
noises
of
a
city
below
the
hillside
and
the
breath
of
a
cool

with

them

a

of

split
up
the
lamplight
beyond
is
come
said
the
boy
in
a
voice
little
louder
than
a
sigh
and
vanished
kim
felt
sure
that
the
boy
had
been
posted
to
guide
him
from
the
first
but
putting
a
bold
face
on
it
parted
the
curtain
a
man
with
a
green
shade
over
his
eyes
sat
at
a
table
and
one
by
one
with
short
white
hands
picked
up
globules
of
light
from
a
tray
before
him
threaded
them
on
a
glancing
silken
string
and
hummed
to
himself
the
while
kim
was
conscious
that
beyond
the
circle
of
light
the
room
was
full
of
things
that
smelt
like
all
the
temples
of
all
the
east
a
whiff
of
musk
a
puff
of
and
a
breath
of
sickly
caught
his
opened
nostrils
am
here
said
kim
at
last
speaking
in
the
vernacular
the
smells
made
him
forget
that
he
was
to
be
a
sahib
eighty
the
man
counted
to
himself
stringing
pearl
after
pearl
so
quickly
that
kim
could
scarcely
follow
his
fingers
he
slid
off
the
green
shade
and
looked
fixedly
at
kim
for
a
full
the
pupils
of
the
eye
dilated
and
closed
to
as
if
at
will
there
was
a
fakir
by
the
taksali
gate
who
had
just
this
gift
and
made
money
by
it
especially
when
cursing
silly
women
kim
stared
with
interest
his
disreputable
friend
could
further
twitch
his
ears
almost
like
a
goat
and
kim
was
disappointed
that
this
new
man
could
not
imitate
him
not
be
afraid
said
lurgan
sahib
suddenly
should
i
fear
wilt
sleep
here
tonight
and
stay
with
me
till
it
is
time
to
go
again
to
nucklao
it
is
an
order
is
an
order
kim
repeated
where
shall
i
sleep
in
this
room
lurgan
sahib
waved
his
hand
towards
the
darkness
behind
him
be
it
said
kim
composedly
he
nodded
and
held
the
lamp
above
his
head
as
the
light
swept
them
there
leaped
out
from
the
walls
a
collection
of
tibetan
masks
hanging
above
the
draperies
of
those
ghastly
functions
horned
masks
scowling
masks
and
masks
of
idiotic
terror
in
a
corner
a
japanese
warrior
mailed
and
plumed
menaced
him
with
a
halberd
and
a
score
of
lances
and
khandas
and
kuttars
gave
back
the
unsteady
gleam
but
what
interested
kim
more
than
all
these
things
he
had
seen
masks
at
the
lahore
museum
was
a
glimpse
of
the
hindu
child
who
had
left
him
in
the
doorway
sitting
under
the
table
of
pearls
with
a
little
smile
on
his
scarlet
lips
think
that
lurgan
sahib
wishes
to
make
me
afraid
and
i
am
sure
that
that
devil
brat
below
the
table
wishes
to
see
me
afraid
place
he
said
aloud
like
a
wonder
house
where
is
my
bed
lurgan
sahib
pointed
to
a
native
quilt
in
a
corner
by
the
loathsome
masks
picked
up
the
lamp
and
left
the
room
black
that
lurgan
sahib
kim
asked
as
he
cuddled
down
no
answer
he
could
hear
the
hindu
boy
breathing
however
and
guided
by
the
sound
crawled
across
the
floor
and
cuffed
into
the
darkness
crying
answer
devil
is
this
the
way
to
lie
to
a
sahib
from
the
darkness
he
fancied
he
could
hear
the
echo
of
a
chuckle
it
could
not
be
his
companion
because
he
was
weeping
so
kim
lifted
up
his
voice
and
called
aloud
sahib
o
lurgan
sahib
is
it
an
order
that
thy
servant
does
not
speak
to
me
is
an
order
the
voice
came
from
behind
him
and
he
started
good
but
remember
he
muttered
as
he
resought
the
quilt
will
beat
thee
in
the
morning
i
do
not
love
hindus
that
was
no
cheerful
night
the
room
being
overfull
of
voices
and
music
kim
was
waked
twice
by
someone
calling
his
name
the
second
time
he
set
out
in
search
and
ended
by
bruising
his
nose
against
a
box
that
certainly
spoke
with
a
human
tongue
but
in
no
sort
of
human
accent
it
seemed
to
end
in
a
tin
trumpet
and
to
be
joined
by
wires
to
a
smaller
box
on
the
floor
so
far
at
least
as
he
could
judge
by
touch
and
the
voice
very
hard
and
whirring
came
out
of
the
trumpet
kim
rubbed
his
nose
and
grew
furious
thinking
as
usual
in
hindi
with
a
beggar
from
the
bazar
might
be
good
but
i
am
a
sahib
and
the
son
of
a
sahib
and
which
is
twice
as
much
more
beside
a
student
of
nucklao
yess
here
he
turned
to
english
boy
of
st
xavier
damn
mr
lurgan
eyes
it
is
some
sort
of
machinery
like
a
oh
it
is
a
great
cheek
of
him
we
are
not
frightened
that
way
at
lucknow
no
then
in
hindi
what
does
he
gain
he
is
only
a
trader
i
am
in
his
shop
but
creighton
sahib
is
a
colonel
and
i
think
creighton
sahib
gave
orders
that
it
should
be
done
how
i
will
beat
that
hindu
in
the
morning
what
is
this
the
was
pouring
out
a
string
of
the
most
elaborate
abuse
that
even
kim
had
ever
heard
in
a
high
uninterested
voice
that
for
a
moment
lifted
the
short
hairs
of
his
neck
when
the
vile
thing
drew
breath
kim
was
reassured
by
the
soft
whirr
be
still
he
cried
and
again
he
heard
a
chuckle
that
decided
him
or
i
break
your
head
the
box
took
no
heed
kim
wrenched
at
the
tin
trumpet
and
something
lifted
with
a
click
he
had
evidently
raised
a
lid
if
there
were
a
devil
inside
now
was
its
time
for
he
sniffed
thus
did
the
of
the
bazar
smell
he
would
clean
that
shaitan
he
slipped
off
his
jacket
and
plunged
it
into
the
box
mouth
something
long
and
round
bent
under
the
pressure
there
was
a
whirr
and
the
voice
stopped
as
voices
must
if
you
ram
a
coat
on
to
the
wax
cylinder
and
into
the
works
of
an
expensive
phonograph
kim
finished
his
slumbers
with
a
serene
mind
in
the
morning
he
was
aware
of
lurgan
sahib
looking
down
on
him
said
kim
firmly
resolved
to
cling
to
his
was
a
box
in
the
night
that
gave
me
bad
talk
so
i
stopped
it
was
it
your
box
the
man
held
out
his
hand
hands
he
said
it
was
my
box
i
keep
such
things
because
my
friends
the
rajahs
like
them
that
one
is
broken
but
it
was
cheap
at
the
price
yes
my
friends
the
kings
are
very
fond
of
toys
and
so
am
i
sometimes
kim
looked
him
over
out
of
the
corners
of
his
eyes
he
was
a
sahib
in
that
he
wore
sahib
clothes
the
accent
of
his
urdu
the
intonation
of
his
english
showed
that
he
was
anything
but
a
sahib
he
seemed
to
understand
what
moved
in
kim
mind
ere
the
boy
opened
his
mouth
and
he
took
no
pains
to
explain
himself
as
did
father
victor
or
the
lucknow
masters
sweetest
of
all
he
treated
kim
as
an
equal
on
the
asiatic
side
am
sorry
you
can
not
beat
my
boy
this
morning
he
says
he
will
kill
you
with
a
knife
or
poison
he
is
jealous
so
i
have
put
him
in
the
corner
and
i
shall
not
speak
to
him
today
he
has
just
tried
to
kill
me
you
must
help
me
with
the
breakfast
he
is
almost
too
jealous
to
trust
just
now
now
a
genuine
imported
sahib
from
england
would
have
made
a
great
over
this
tale
lurgan
sahib
stated
it
as
simply
as
mahbub
ali
was
used
to
record
his
little
affairs
in
the
north
the
back
veranda
of
the
shop
was
built
out
over
the
sheer
hillside
and
they
looked
down
into
their
neighbours
as
is
the
custom
of
simla
but
even
more
than
the
purely
persian
meal
cooked
by
lurgan
sahib
with
his
own
hands
the
shop
fascinated
kim
the
lahore
museum
was
larger
but
here
were
more
wonders
and
from
tibet
turquoise
and
raw
amber
necklaces
green
jade
bangles
curiously
packed
in
jars
crusted
over
with
raw
garnets
the
of
overnight
and
a
wall
full
of
draperies
gilt
figures
of
buddha
and
little
portable
lacquer
altars
russian
samovars
with
turquoises
on
the
lid
china
sets
in
quaint
octagonal
cane
boxes
yellow
ivory
crucifixes
from
japan
of
all
places
in
the
world
so
lurgan
sahib
said
carpets
in
dusty
bales
smelling
atrociously
pushed
back
behind
torn
and
rotten
screens
of
geometrical
work
persian
for
the
hands
after
meals
dull
copper
neither
chinese
nor
persian
with
friezes
of
fantastic
devils
running
round
them
tarnished
silver
belts
that
knotted
like
raw
hide
hairpins
of
jade
ivory
and
plasma
arms
of
all
sorts
and
kinds
and
a
thousand
other
oddments
were
cased
or
piled
or
merely
thrown
into
the
room
leaving
a
clear
space
only
round
the
rickety
deal
table
where
lurgan
sahib
worked
things
are
nothing
said
his
host
following
kim
glance
buy
them
because
they
are
pretty
and
sometimes
i
sell
if
i
like
the
buyer
look
my
work
is
on
the
table
some
of
it
it
blazed
in
the
morning
light
all
red
and
blue
and
green
flashes
picked
out
with
the
vicious
spurt
of
a
diamond
here
and
there
kim
opened
his
eyes
they
are
quite
well
those
stones
it
will
not
hurt
them
to
take
the
sun
besides
they
are
cheap
but
with
sick
stones
it
is
very
different
he
piled
kim
plate
anew
is
no
one
but
me
can
doctor
a
sick
pearl
and
turquoises
i
grant
you
opals
any
fool
can
cure
an
opal
but
for
a
sick
pearl
there
is
only
me
suppose
i
were
to
die
then
there
would
be
no
one
oh
no
you
can
not
do
anything
with
jewels
it
will
be
quite
enough
if
you
understand
a
little
about
the
turquoise
some
day
he
moved
to
the
end
of
the
veranda
to
refill
the
heavy
porous
clay
from
the
filter
you
want
drink
kim
nodded
lurgan
sahib
fifteen
feet
off
laid
one
hand
on
the
jar
next
instant
it
stood
at
kim
elbow
full
to
within
half
an
inch
of
the
brim
the
white
cloth
only
showing
by
a
small
wrinkle
where
it
had
slid
into
place
said
kim
in
most
utter
amazement
is
magic
lurgan
sahib
smile
showed
that
the
compliment
had
gone
home
it
back
will
break
say
throw
it
back
kim
pitched
it
at
random
it
fell
short
and
crashed
into
fifty
pieces
while
the
water
dripped
through
the
rough
veranda
boarding
said
it
would
break
one
look
at
it
look
at
the
largest
piece
that
lay
with
a
sparkle
of
water
in
its
curve
as
it
were
a
star
on
the
floor
kim
looked
intently
lurgan
sahib
laid
one
hand
gently
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
stroked
it
twice
or
thrice
and
whispered
it
shall
come
to
life
again
piece
by
piece
first
the
big
piece
shall
join
itself
to
two
others
on
the
right
and
the
left
on
the
right
and
the
left
look
to
save
his
life
kim
could
not
have
turned
his
head
the
light
touch
held
him
as
in
a
vice
and
his
blood
tingled
pleasantly
through
him
there
was
one
large
piece
of
the
jar
where
there
had
been
three
and
above
them
the
shadowy
outline
of
the
entire
vessel
he
could
see
the
veranda
through
it
but
it
was
thickening
and
darkening
with
each
beat
of
his
pulse
yet
the
jar
how
slowly
the
thoughts
came
the
jar
had
been
smashed
before
his
eyes
another
wave
of
prickling
fire
raced
down
his
neck
as
lurgan
sahib
moved
his
hand
it
is
coming
into
shape
said
lurgan
sahib
so
far
kim
had
been
thinking
in
hindi
but
a
tremor
came
on
him
and
with
an
effort
like
that
of
a
swimmer
before
sharks
who
hurls
himself
half
out
of
the
water
his
mind
leaped
up
from
a
darkness
that
was
swallowing
it
and
took
refuge
in
the
in
english
it
is
coming
into
shape
whispered
lurgan
sahib
the
jar
had
been
smashed
yess
smashed
not
the
native
word
he
would
not
think
of
that
but
smashed
into
fifty
pieces
and
twice
three
was
six
and
thrice
three
was
nine
and
four
times
three
was
twelve
he
clung
desperately
to
the
repetition
the
of
the
jar
cleared
like
a
mist
after
rubbing
eyes
there
were
the
broken
shards
there
was
the
spilt
water
drying
in
the
sun
and
through
the
cracks
of
the
veranda
showed
all
ribbed
the
white
below
and
thrice
twelve
was
is
it
coming
into
shape
asked
lurgan
sahib
it
is
smashed
smashed
he
gasped
lurgan
sahib
had
been
muttering
softly
for
the
last
kim
wrenched
his
head
aside
dekho
it
is
there
as
it
was
there
is
there
as
it
was
there
said
lurgan
watching
kim
closely
while
the
boy
rubbed
his
neck
you
are
the
first
of
many
who
has
ever
seen
it
so
he
wiped
his
broad
forehead
that
more
magic
kim
asked
suspiciously
the
tingle
had
gone
from
his
veins
he
felt
unusually
wide
awake
that
was
not
magic
it
was
only
to
see
if
there
was
a
flaw
in
a
jewel
sometimes
very
fine
jewels
will
fly
all
to
pieces
if
a
man
holds
them
in
his
hand
and
knows
the
proper
way
that
is
why
one
must
be
careful
before
one
sets
them
tell
me
did
you
see
the
shape
of
the
pot
a
little
time
it
began
to
grow
like
a
flower
from
the
ground
then
what
did
you
do
i
mean
how
did
you
think
i
knew
it
was
broken
and
so
i
think
that
was
what
i
thought
and
it
was
broken
has
anyone
ever
done
that
same
sort
of
magic
to
you
before
it
was
said
kim
you
think
i
should
let
it
again
i
should
run
away
now
you
are
not
afraid
eh
now
lurgan
sahib
looked
at
him
more
closely
than
ever
shall
ask
mahbub
ali
not
now
but
some
day
later
he
muttered
am
pleased
with
you
yes
and
i
am
pleased
with
you
no
you
are
the
first
that
ever
saved
himself
i
wish
i
knew
what
it
was
that
but
you
are
right
you
should
not
tell
that
not
even
to
me
he
turned
into
the
dusky
gloom
of
the
shop
and
sat
down
at
the
table
rubbing
his
hands
softly
a
small
husky
sob
came
from
behind
a
pile
of
carpets
it
was
the
hindu
child
obediently
facing
towards
the
wall
his
thin
shoulders
worked
with
grief
he
is
jealous
so
jealous
i
wonder
if
he
will
try
to
poison
me
again
in
my
breakfast
and
make
me
cook
it
twice
kubbee
nahin
never
never
no
came
the
broken
answer
whether
he
will
kill
this
other
boy
kubbee
nahin
do
you
think
he
will
do
he
turned
suddenly
on
kim
i
do
not
know
let
him
go
perhaps
why
did
he
want
to
poison
you
he
is
so
fond
of
me
suppose
you
were
fond
of
someone
and
you
saw
someone
come
and
the
man
you
were
fond
of
was
more
pleased
with
him
than
he
was
with
you
what
would
you
do
kim
thought
lurgan
repeated
the
sentence
slowly
in
the
vernacular
should
not
poison
that
man
said
kim
reflectively
i
should
beat
that
boy
if
that
boy
was
fond
of
my
man
but
first
i
would
ask
that
boy
if
it
were
true
he
thinks
everyone
must
be
fond
of
me
i
think
he
is
a
fool
thou
said
lurgan
sahib
to
the
shaking
shoulders
sahib
son
thinks
thou
art
a
little
fool
come
out
and
next
time
thy
heart
is
troubled
do
not
try
white
arsenic
quite
so
openly
surely
the
devil
dasim
was
lord
of
our
that
day
it
might
have
made
me
ill
child
and
then
a
stranger
would
have
guarded
the
jewels
come
the
child
with
much
weeping
crept
out
from
behind
the
bale
and
flung
himself
passionately
at
lurgan
sahib
feet
with
an
extravagance
of
remorse
that
impressed
even
kim
will
look
into
the
i
will
faithfully
guard
the
jewels
oh
my
father
and
my
mother
send
him
away
he
indicated
kim
with
a
backward
jerk
of
his
bare
heel
yet
not
yet
in
a
little
while
he
will
go
away
again
but
now
he
is
at
school
at
a
new
madrissah
and
thou
shalt
be
his
teacher
play
the
play
of
the
jewels
against
him
i
will
keep
tally
the
child
dried
his
tears
at
once
and
dashed
to
the
back
of
the
shop
whence
he
returned
with
a
copper
tray
me
he
said
to
lurgan
sahib
them
come
from
thy
hand
for
he
may
say
that
i
knew
them
before
gently
the
man
replied
and
from
a
drawer
under
the
table
dealt
a
of
clattering
trifles
into
the
tray
said
the
child
waving
an
old
newspaper
on
them
as
long
as
thou
wilt
stranger
count
and
if
need
be
handle
one
look
is
enough
for
me
he
turned
his
back
proudly
what
is
the
game
thou
hast
counted
and
handled
and
art
sure
that
thou
canst
remember
them
all
i
cover
them
with
this
paper
and
thou
must
tell
over
the
tally
to
lurgan
sahib
i
will
write
mine
the
instinct
of
competition
waked
in
his
breast
he
bent
over
the
tray
there
were
but
fifteen
stones
on
it
is
easy
he
said
after
a
minute
the
child
slipped
the
paper
over
the
winking
jewels
and
scribbled
in
a
native
are
under
that
paper
five
blue
stones
one
big
one
smaller
and
three
small
said
kim
all
in
haste
are
four
green
stones
and
one
with
a
hole
in
it
there
is
one
yellow
stone
that
i
can
see
through
and
one
like
a
there
are
two
red
stones
and
and
i
made
the
count
fifteen
but
two
i
have
forgotten
no
give
me
time
one
was
of
ivory
little
and
brownish
and
and
give
me
time
two
lurgan
sahib
counted
him
out
up
to
ten
kim
shook
his
head
my
count
the
child
burst
in
trilling
with
laughter
are
two
flawed
sapphires
one
of
two
ruttees
and
one
of
four
as
i
should
judge
the
sapphire
is
chipped
at
the
edge
there
is
one
turkestan
turquoise
plain
with
black
veins
and
there
are
two
inscribed
one
with
a
name
of
god
in
gilt
and
the
other
being
cracked
across
for
it
came
out
of
an
old
ring
i
can
not
read
we
have
now
all
five
blue
stones
four
flawed
emeralds
there
are
but
one
is
drilled
in
two
places
and
one
is
a
little
weights
said
lurgan
sahib
impassively
five
five
and
four
ruttees
as
i
judge
it
there
is
one
piece
of
old
greenish
pipe
amber
and
a
cut
topaz
from
europe
there
is
one
ruby
of
burma
of
two
ruttees
without
a
flaw
and
there
is
a
flawed
of
two
ruttees
there
is
a
carved
ivory
from
china
representing
a
rat
sucking
an
egg
and
there
is
last
ah
ha
a
ball
of
crystal
as
big
as
a
bean
set
on
a
gold
leaf
he
clapped
his
hands
at
the
close
is
thy
master
said
lurgan
sahib
smiling
he
knew
the
names
of
the
stones
said
kim
flushing
again
with
common
things
such
as
he
and
i
both
know
they
heaped
the
tray
again
with
odds
and
ends
gathered
from
the
shop
and
even
the
kitchen
and
every
time
the
child
won
till
kim
marvelled
my
eyes
let
me
feel
once
with
my
fingers
and
even
then
i
will
leave
thee
behind
he
challenged
kim
stamped
with
vexation
when
the
lad
made
his
boast
good
it
were
men
or
horses
he
said
could
do
better
this
playing
with
tweezers
and
knives
and
scissors
is
too
little
first
teach
later
said
lurgan
sahib
he
thy
master
but
how
is
it
done
doing
it
many
times
over
till
it
is
done
perfectly
for
it
is
worth
doing
the
hindu
boy
in
highest
feather
actually
patted
kim
on
the
back
not
despair
he
said
myself
will
teach
thee
i
will
see
that
thou
art
well
taught
said
lurgan
sahib
still
speaking
in
the
vernacular
except
my
boy
here
it
was
foolish
of
him
to
buy
so
much
white
arsenic
when
if
he
had
asked
i
could
have
given
it
except
my
boy
here
i
have
not
in
a
long
time
met
with
one
better
worth
teaching
and
there
are
ten
days
more
ere
thou
canst
return
to
lucknao
where
they
teach
nothing
at
the
long
price
we
shall
i
think
be
friends
they
were
a
most
mad
ten
days
but
kim
enjoyed
himself
too
much
to
reflect
on
their
craziness
in
the
morning
they
played
the
jewel
game
sometimes
with
veritable
stones
sometimes
with
piles
of
swords
and
daggers
sometimes
with
of
natives
through
the
afternoons
he
and
the
hindu
boy
would
mount
guard
in
the
shop
sitting
dumb
behind
a
or
a
screen
and
watching
mr
lurgan
many
and
very
curious
visitors
there
were
small
rajahs
escorts
coughing
in
the
veranda
who
came
to
buy
curiosities
such
as
phonographs
and
mechanical
toys
there
were
ladies
in
search
of
necklaces
and
men
it
seemed
to
kim
but
his
mind
may
have
been
vitiated
by
early
training
in
search
of
the
ladies
natives
from
independent
and
feudatory
courts
whose
ostensible
business
was
the
repair
of
broken
necklaces
rivers
of
light
poured
out
upon
the
table
but
whose
true
end
seemed
to
be
to
raise
money
for
angry
maharanees
or
young
rajahs
there
were
babus
to
whom
lurgan
sahib
talked
with
austerity
and
authority
but
at
the
end
of
each
interview
he
gave
them
money
in
coined
silver
and
currency
notes
there
were
occasional
gatherings
of
theatrical
natives
who
discussed
metaphysics
in
english
and
bengali
to
mr
lurgan
great
edification
he
was
always
interested
in
religions
at
the
end
of
the
day
kim
and
the
hindu
boy
whose
name
varied
at
lurgan
pleasure
were
expected
to
give
a
detailed
account
of
all
that
they
had
seen
and
heard
their
view
of
each
character
as
shown
in
his
face
talk
and
manner
and
their
notions
of
his
real
errand
after
dinner
lurgan
sahib
fancy
turned
more
to
what
might
be
called
in
which
game
he
took
a
most
informing
interest
he
could
paint
faces
to
a
marvel
with
a
here
and
a
line
there
changing
them
past
recognition
the
shop
was
full
of
all
manner
of
dresses
and
turbans
and
kim
was
apparelled
variously
as
a
young
mohammedan
of
good
family
an
oilman
and
once
which
was
a
joyous
evening
as
the
son
of
an
oudh
landholder
in
the
fullest
of
full
dress
lurgan
sahib
had
a
hawk
eye
to
detect
the
least
flaw
in
the
and
lying
on
a
worn
couch
would
explain
by
the
together
how
such
and
such
a
caste
talked
or
walked
or
coughed
or
spat
or
sneezed
and
since
matter
little
in
this
world
the
of
everything
the
hindu
child
played
this
game
clumsily
that
little
mind
keen
as
an
icicle
where
tally
of
jewels
was
concerned
could
not
temper
itself
to
enter
another
soul
but
a
demon
in
kim
woke
up
and
sang
with
joy
as
he
put
on
the
changing
dresses
and
changed
speech
and
gesture
therewith
carried
away
by
enthusiasm
he
volunteered
to
show
lurgan
sahib
one
evening
how
the
disciples
of
a
certain
caste
of
fakir
old
lahore
acquaintances
begged
doles
by
the
roadside
and
what
sort
of
language
he
would
use
to
an
englishman
to
a
punjabi
farmer
going
to
a
fair
and
to
a
woman
without
a
veil
lurgan
sahib
laughed
immensely
and
begged
kim
to
stay
as
he
was
immobile
for
half
an
hour
and
in
the
back
room
at
the
end
of
that
time
entered
a
hulking
obese
babu
whose
stockinged
legs
shook
with
fat
and
kim
opened
on
him
with
a
shower
of
wayside
chaff
lurgan
sahib
this
annoyed
kim
watched
the
babu
and
not
the
play
think
said
the
babu
heavily
lighting
a
cigarette
am
of
opeenion
that
it
is
most
extraordinary
and
effeecient
performance
except
that
you
had
told
me
i
should
have
opined
that
that
that
you
were
pulling
my
legs
how
soon
can
he
become
approximately
effeecient
because
then
i
shall
indent
for
him
is
what
he
must
learn
at
lucknow
order
him
to
be
lurgan
the
babu
swung
out
with
the
gait
of
a
bogged
cow
when
they
were
telling
over
the
day
list
of
visitors
lurgan
sahib
asked
kim
who
he
thought
the
man
might
be
knows
said
kim
cheerily
the
tone
might
almost
have
deceived
mahbub
ali
but
it
failed
entirely
with
the
healer
of
sick
pearls
is
true
god
he
knows
but
i
wish
to
know
what
you
think
kim
glanced
sideways
at
his
companion
whose
eye
had
a
way
of
compelling
truth
i
think
he
will
want
me
when
i
come
from
the
school
but
confidentially
as
lurgan
sahib
nodded
approval
do
not
understand
how
he
can
wear
many
dresses
and
talk
many
tongues
wilt
understand
many
things
later
he
is
a
writer
of
tales
for
a
certain
colonel
his
honour
is
great
only
in
simla
and
it
is
noticeable
that
he
has
no
name
but
only
a
number
and
a
letter
that
is
a
custom
among
us
is
there
a
price
upon
his
head
too
as
upon
mah
all
the
others
yet
but
if
a
boy
rose
up
who
is
now
sitting
here
and
went
look
the
door
is
open
as
far
as
a
certain
house
with
a
veranda
behind
that
which
was
the
old
theatre
in
the
lower
bazar
and
whispered
through
the
shutters
hurree
chunder
mookerjee
bore
the
bad
news
of
last
month
that
boy
might
take
away
a
belt
full
of
rupees
many
said
kim
promptly
hundred
a
thousand
as
many
as
he
might
ask
for
and
for
how
long
might
such
a
boy
live
after
the
news
was
told
he
smiled
merrily
at
lurgan
sahib
very
beard
that
is
to
be
well
thought
of
perhaps
if
he
were
very
clever
he
might
live
out
the
day
but
not
the
night
by
no
means
the
night
what
is
the
babu
pay
if
so
much
is
put
upon
his
head
perhaps
a
hundred
perhaps
a
hundred
and
fifty
rupees
but
the
pay
is
the
least
part
of
the
work
from
time
to
time
god
causes
men
to
be
born
and
thou
art
one
of
them
who
have
a
lust
to
go
abroad
at
the
risk
of
their
lives
and
discover
news
today
it
may
be
of
things
tomorrow
of
some
hidden
mountain
and
the
next
day
of
some
men
who
have
done
a
foolishness
against
the
state
these
souls
are
very
few
and
of
these
few
not
more
than
ten
are
of
the
best
among
these
ten
i
count
the
babu
and
that
is
curious
how
great
therefore
and
desirable
must
be
a
business
that
brazens
the
heart
of
a
bengali
but
the
days
go
slowly
for
me
i
am
yet
a
boy
and
it
is
only
within
two
months
i
learned
to
write
angrezi
even
now
i
can
not
read
it
well
and
there
are
yet
years
and
years
and
long
years
before
i
can
be
even
a
patience
friend
of
all
the
world
kim
started
at
the
title
i
had
a
few
of
the
years
that
so
irk
thee
i
have
proved
thee
in
several
small
ways
this
will
not
be
forgotten
when
i
make
my
report
to
the
colonel
sahib
then
changing
suddenly
into
english
with
a
deep
laugh
jove
i
think
there
is
a
great
deal
in
you
but
you
must
not
become
proud
and
you
must
not
talk
you
must
go
back
to
lucknow
and
be
a
good
little
boy
and
mind
your
book
as
the
english
say
and
perhaps
next
holidays
if
you
care
you
can
come
back
to
me
face
fell
i
mean
if
you
like
i
know
where
you
want
to
go
four
days
later
a
seat
was
booked
for
kim
and
his
small
trunk
at
the
rear
of
a
kalka
tonga
his
companion
was
the
babu
who
with
a
fringed
shawl
wrapped
round
his
head
and
his
fat
left
leg
tucked
under
him
shivered
and
grunted
in
the
morning
chill
comes
it
that
this
man
is
one
of
us
thought
kim
considering
the
jelly
back
as
they
jolted
down
the
road
and
the
reflection
threw
him
into
most
pleasant
lurgan
sahib
had
given
him
five
rupees
a
splendid
sum
as
well
as
the
assurance
of
his
protection
if
he
worked
unlike
mahbub
lurgan
sahib
had
spoken
most
explicitly
of
the
reward
that
would
follow
obedience
and
kim
was
content
if
only
like
the
babu
he
could
enjoy
the
dignity
of
a
letter
and
a
number
and
a
price
upon
his
head
some
day
he
would
be
all
that
and
more
some
day
he
might
be
almost
as
great
as
mahbub
ali
the
housetops
of
his
search
should
be
half
india
he
would
follow
kings
and
ministers
as
in
the
old
days
he
had
followed
vakils
and
lawyers
touts
across
lahore
city
for
mahbub
ali
sake
meantime
there
was
the
present
and
not
at
all
unpleasant
fact
of
st
xavier
immediately
before
him
there
would
be
new
boys
to
condescend
to
and
there
would
be
tales
of
holiday
adventures
to
hear
young
martin
son
of
the
at
manipur
had
boasted
that
he
would
go
to
war
with
a
rifle
against
the
that
might
be
but
it
was
certain
young
martin
had
not
been
blown
half
across
the
forecourt
of
a
patiala
palace
by
an
explosion
of
fireworks
nor
had
he
kim
fell
to
telling
himself
the
story
of
his
own
adventures
through
the
last
three
months
he
could
paralyse
st
xavier
even
the
biggest
boys
who
shaved
with
the
recital
were
that
permitted
but
it
was
of
course
out
of
the
question
there
would
be
a
price
upon
his
head
in
good
time
as
lurgan
sahib
had
assured
him
and
if
he
talked
foolishly
now
not
only
would
that
price
never
be
set
but
colonel
creighton
would
cast
him
off
and
he
would
be
left
to
the
wrath
of
lurgan
sahib
and
mahbub
ali
for
the
short
space
of
life
that
would
remain
to
him
i
should
lose
delhi
for
the
sake
of
a
fish
was
his
proverbial
philosophy
it
behoved
him
to
forget
his
holidays
there
would
always
remain
the
fun
of
inventing
imaginary
adventures
and
as
lurgan
sahib
had
said
to
work
of
all
the
boys
hurrying
back
to
st
xavier
from
sukkur
in
the
sands
to
galle
beneath
the
palms
none
was
so
filled
with
virtue
as
kimball
jiggeting
down
to
umballa
behind
hurree
chunder
mookerjee
whose
name
on
the
books
of
one
section
of
the
ethnological
survey
was
and
if
additional
spur
were
needed
the
babu
supplied
it
after
a
huge
meal
at
kalka
he
spoke
uninterruptedly
was
kim
going
to
school
then
he
an
m
a
of
calcutta
university
would
explain
the
advantages
of
education
there
were
marks
to
be
gained
by
due
attention
to
latin
and
wordsworth
excursion
all
this
was
greek
to
kim
french
too
was
vital
and
the
best
was
to
be
picked
up
in
chandernagore
a
few
miles
from
calcutta
also
a
man
might
go
far
as
he
himself
had
done
by
strict
attention
to
plays
called
lear
and
julius
caesar
both
much
in
demand
by
examiners
lear
was
not
so
full
of
historical
allusions
as
julius
caesar
the
book
cost
four
annas
but
could
be
bought
in
bow
bazar
for
two
still
more
important
than
wordsworth
or
the
eminent
authors
burke
and
hare
was
the
art
and
science
of
mensuration
a
boy
who
had
passed
his
examination
in
these
branches
for
which
by
the
way
there
were
no
could
by
merely
marching
over
a
country
with
a
compass
and
a
level
and
a
straight
eye
carry
away
a
picture
of
that
country
which
might
be
sold
for
large
sums
in
coined
silver
but
as
it
was
occasionally
inexpedient
to
carry
about
a
boy
would
do
well
to
know
the
precise
length
of
his
own
so
that
when
he
was
deprived
of
what
hurree
chunder
called
adventitious
aids
he
might
still
tread
his
distances
to
keep
count
of
thousands
of
paces
hurree
experience
had
shown
him
nothing
more
valuable
than
a
rosary
of
or
a
hundred
and
eight
beads
for
was
divisible
and
into
many
multiples
and
through
the
volleying
drifts
of
english
kim
caught
the
general
trend
of
the
talk
and
it
interested
him
very
much
here
was
a
new
craft
that
a
man
could
tuck
away
in
his
head
and
by
the
look
of
the
large
wide
world
unfolding
itself
before
him
it
seemed
that
the
more
a
man
knew
the
better
for
him
said
the
babu
when
he
had
talked
for
an
hour
and
a
half
hope
some
day
to
enjoy
your
offeecial
acquaintance
ad
interim
if
i
may
be
pardoned
that
expression
i
shall
give
you
this
which
is
highly
valuable
article
and
cost
me
two
rupees
only
four
years
ago
it
was
a
cheap
brass
thing
with
three
compartments
for
carrying
the
eternal
lime
and
but
it
was
filled
with
little
is
reward
of
merit
for
your
performance
in
character
of
that
holy
man
you
see
you
are
so
young
you
think
you
will
last
for
ever
and
not
take
care
of
your
body
it
is
great
nuisance
to
go
sick
in
the
middle
of
business
i
am
fond
of
drugs
myself
and
they
are
handy
to
cure
poor
people
too
these
are
good
departmental
drugs
quinine
and
so
on
i
give
it
you
for
souvenir
now
i
have
urgent
private
business
here
by
the
roadside
he
slipped
out
noiselessly
as
a
cat
on
the
umballa
road
hailed
a
passing
cart
and
jingled
away
while
kim
twiddled
the
brass
in
his
hands
the
record
of
a
boy
education
interests
few
save
his
parents
and
as
you
know
kim
was
an
orphan
it
is
written
in
the
books
of
st
in
partibus
that
a
report
of
kim
progress
was
forwarded
at
the
end
of
each
term
to
colonel
creighton
and
to
father
victor
from
whose
hands
duly
came
the
money
for
his
schooling
it
is
further
recorded
in
the
same
books
that
he
showed
a
great
aptitude
for
mathematical
studies
as
well
as
and
carried
away
a
prize
the
life
of
lord
lawrence
two
nine
rupees
eight
annas
for
proficiency
therein
and
the
same
term
played
in
st
xavier
eleven
against
the
alighur
mohammedan
college
his
age
being
fourteen
years
and
ten
months
he
was
also
from
which
we
may
assume
that
there
had
been
another
epidemic
of
smallpox
at
lucknow
about
the
same
time
pencil
notes
on
the
edge
of
an
old
record
that
he
was
punished
several
times
for
with
improper
persons
and
it
seems
that
he
was
once
sentenced
to
heavy
pains
for
himself
for
a
day
in
the
company
of
a
street
beggar
that
was
when
he
got
over
the
gate
and
pleaded
with
the
lama
through
a
whole
day
down
the
banks
of
the
gumti
to
accompany
him
on
the
road
next
holidays
for
one
month
for
a
little
week
and
the
lama
set
his
face
as
a
flint
against
it
averring
that
the
time
had
not
yet
come
kim
business
said
the
old
man
as
they
ate
cakes
together
was
to
get
all
the
wisdom
of
the
sahibs
and
then
he
would
see
the
hand
of
friendship
must
in
some
way
have
averted
the
whip
of
calamity
for
six
weeks
later
kim
seems
to
have
passed
an
examination
in
elementary
surveying
great
credit
his
age
being
fifteen
years
and
eight
months
from
this
date
the
record
is
silent
his
name
does
not
appear
in
the
year
batch
of
those
who
entered
for
the
subordinate
survey
of
india
but
against
it
stand
the
words
on
appointment
several
times
in
those
three
years
cast
up
at
the
temple
of
the
tirthankars
in
benares
the
lama
a
little
thinner
and
a
shade
yellower
if
that
were
possible
but
gentle
and
untainted
as
ever
sometimes
it
was
from
the
south
that
he
came
from
south
of
tuticorin
whence
the
wonderful
go
to
ceylon
where
are
priests
who
know
pali
sometimes
it
was
from
the
wet
green
west
and
the
thousand
chimneys
that
ring
bombay
and
once
from
the
north
where
he
had
doubled
back
eight
hundred
miles
to
talk
for
a
day
with
the
keeper
of
the
images
in
the
wonder
house
he
would
stride
to
his
cell
in
the
cool
cut
marble
the
priests
of
the
temple
were
good
to
the
old
man
wash
off
the
dust
of
travel
make
prayer
and
depart
for
lucknow
well
accustomed
now
to
the
way
of
the
rail
in
a
carriage
returning
it
was
noticeable
as
his
friend
the
seeker
pointed
out
to
the
that
he
ceased
for
a
while
to
mourn
the
loss
of
his
river
or
to
draw
wondrous
pictures
of
the
wheel
of
life
but
preferred
to
talk
of
the
beauty
and
wisdom
of
a
certain
mysterious
chela
whom
no
man
of
the
temple
had
ever
seen
yes
he
had
followed
the
traces
of
the
blessed
feet
throughout
all
india
the
curator
has
still
in
his
possession
a
most
marvellous
account
of
his
wanderings
and
meditations
there
remained
nothing
more
in
life
but
to
find
the
river
of
the
arrow
yet
it
was
shown
to
him
in
dreams
that
it
was
a
matter
not
to
be
undertaken
with
any
hope
of
success
unless
that
seeker
had
with
him
the
one
chela
appointed
to
bring
the
event
to
a
happy
issue
and
versed
in
great
wisdom
such
wisdom
as
keepers
of
images
possess
for
example
here
came
out
the
and
the
kindly
jain
priests
made
haste
to
be
silent
and
long
ago
when
devadatta
was
king
of
benares
let
all
listen
to
the
tataka
an
elephant
was
captured
for
a
time
by
the
hunters
and
ere
he
broke
free
beringed
with
a
grievous
legiron
this
he
strove
to
remove
with
hate
and
frenzy
in
his
heart
and
hurrying
up
and
down
the
forests
besought
his
to
wrench
it
asunder
one
by
one
with
their
strong
trunks
they
tried
and
failed
at
the
last
they
gave
it
as
their
opinion
that
the
ring
was
not
to
be
broken
by
any
bestial
power
and
in
a
thicket
wet
with
moisture
of
birth
lay
a
calf
of
the
herd
whose
mother
had
died
the
fettered
elephant
forgetting
his
own
agony
said
if
i
do
not
help
this
suckling
it
will
perish
under
our
feet
so
he
stood
above
the
young
thing
making
his
legs
buttresses
against
the
uneasily
moving
herd
and
he
begged
milk
of
a
virtuous
cow
and
the
calf
throve
and
the
ringed
elephant
was
the
calf
guide
and
defence
now
the
days
of
an
elephant
let
all
listen
to
the
tataka
are
years
to
his
full
strength
and
through
rains
the
ringed
elephant
befriended
the
younger
and
all
the
while
the
fetter
ate
into
the
flesh
one
day
the
young
elephant
saw
the
iron
and
turning
to
the
elder
said
what
is
this
it
is
even
my
sorrow
said
he
who
had
befriended
him
then
that
other
put
out
his
trunk
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eyelash
abolished
the
ring
saying
the
appointed
time
has
come
so
the
virtuous
elephant
who
had
waited
temperately
and
done
kind
acts
was
relieved
at
the
appointed
time
by
the
very
calf
whom
he
had
turned
aside
to
cherish
let
all
listen
to
the
tataka
for
the
elephant
was
ananda
and
the
calf
that
broke
the
ring
was
none
other
than
the
lord
himself
then
he
would
shake
his
head
benignly
and
over
the
rosary
point
out
how
free
that
was
from
the
sin
of
pride
he
was
as
humble
as
a
chela
who
seeing
his
master
sitting
in
the
dust
outside
the
gates
of
learning
the
gates
though
they
were
locked
and
took
his
master
to
his
heart
in
the
presence
of
the
city
rich
would
be
the
reward
of
such
a
master
and
such
a
chela
when
the
time
came
for
them
to
seek
freedom
together
so
did
the
lama
speak
coming
and
going
across
india
as
softly
as
a
bat
a
old
woman
in
a
house
among
the
behind
saharunpore
honoured
him
as
the
woman
honoured
the
prophet
but
his
chamber
was
by
no
means
upon
the
wall
in
an
apartment
of
the
forecourt
overlooked
by
cooing
doves
he
would
sit
while
she
laid
aside
her
useless
veil
and
chattered
of
spirits
and
fiends
of
kulu
of
grandchildren
unborn
and
of
the
brat
who
had
talked
to
her
in
the
once
too
he
strayed
alone
from
the
grand
trunk
road
below
umballa
to
the
very
village
whose
priest
had
tried
to
drug
him
but
the
kind
heaven
that
guards
lamas
sent
him
at
twilight
through
the
crops
absorbed
and
unsuspicious
to
the
rissaldar
door
here
was
like
to
have
been
a
grave
misunderstanding
for
the
old
soldier
asked
him
why
the
friend
of
the
stars
had
gone
that
way
only
six
days
before
may
not
be
said
the
lama
has
gone
back
to
his
own
people
sat
in
that
corner
telling
a
hundred
merry
tales
five
nights
ago
his
host
insisted
he
vanished
somewhat
suddenly
in
the
dawn
after
foolish
talk
with
my
granddaughter
he
grows
apace
but
he
is
the
same
friend
of
the
stars
as
brought
me
true
word
of
the
war
have
ye
parted
and
no
the
lama
replied
we
have
not
altogether
parted
but
the
time
is
not
ripe
that
we
should
take
the
road
together
he
acquires
wisdom
in
another
place
we
must
wait
one
but
if
it
were
not
the
boy
how
did
he
come
to
speak
so
continually
of
thee
what
said
he
asked
the
lama
eagerly
words
an
hundred
thousand
that
thou
art
his
father
and
mother
and
such
all
pity
that
he
does
not
take
the
qpeen
service
he
is
fearless
this
news
amazed
the
lama
who
did
not
then
know
how
religiously
kim
kept
to
the
contract
made
with
mahbub
ali
and
perforce
ratified
by
colonel
creighton
is
no
holding
the
young
pony
from
the
game
said
the
when
the
colonel
pointed
out
that
vagabonding
over
india
in
holiday
time
was
absurd
permission
be
refused
to
go
and
come
as
he
chooses
he
will
make
light
of
the
refusal
then
who
is
to
catch
him
colonel
sahib
only
once
in
a
thousand
years
is
a
horse
born
so
well
fitted
for
the
game
as
this
our
colt
and
we
need
men
chapter
your
tiercel
too
long
at
hack
sire
he
no
eyass
but
a
that
footed
ere
we
caught
him
dangerously
free
o
the
air
faith
were
he
mine
as
mine
the
glove
he
binds
to
for
his
tirings
i
fly
him
with
a
he
in
yarak
plumed
to
the
very
point
so
manned
so
weathered
give
him
the
firmament
god
made
him
for
and
what
shall
take
the
air
of
him
gow
watch
lurgan
sahib
did
not
use
as
direct
speech
but
his
advice
tallied
with
mahbub
and
the
upshot
was
good
for
kim
he
knew
better
now
than
to
leave
lucknow
city
in
native
garb
and
if
mahbub
were
anywhere
within
reach
of
a
letter
it
was
to
mahbub
camp
he
headed
and
made
his
change
under
the
pathan
wary
eye
could
the
little
survey
that
he
used
for
in
have
found
a
tongue
to
tell
of
holiday
doings
he
might
have
been
expelled
once
mahbub
and
he
went
together
as
far
as
the
beautiful
city
of
bombay
with
three
truckloads
of
and
mahbub
nearly
melted
when
kim
proposed
a
sail
in
a
dhow
across
the
indian
ocean
to
buy
gulf
arabs
which
he
understood
from
a
of
the
dealer
abdul
rahman
fetched
better
prices
than
mere
kabulis
he
dipped
his
hand
into
the
dish
with
that
great
trader
when
mahbub
and
a
few
were
invited
to
a
big
haj
dinner
they
came
back
by
way
of
karachi
by
sea
when
kim
took
his
first
experience
of
sitting
on
the
of
a
well
persuaded
he
had
been
poisoned
the
babu
famous
proved
useless
though
kim
had
restocked
it
at
bombay
mahbub
had
business
at
quetta
and
there
kim
as
mahbub
admitted
earned
his
keep
and
perhaps
a
little
over
by
spending
four
curious
days
as
scullion
in
the
house
of
a
fat
commissariat
sergeant
from
whose
in
an
auspicious
moment
he
removed
a
little
vellum
ledger
which
he
copied
out
it
seemed
to
deal
entirely
with
cattle
and
camel
sales
by
moonlight
lying
behind
an
outhouse
all
through
one
hot
night
then
he
returned
the
ledger
to
its
place
and
at
mahbub
word
left
that
service
unpaid
rejoining
him
six
miles
down
the
road
the
clean
copy
in
his
bosom
soldier
is
a
small
fish
mahbub
ali
explained
in
time
we
shall
catch
the
larger
one
he
only
sells
oxen
at
two
prices
one
for
himself
and
one
for
the
government
which
i
do
not
think
is
a
sin
could
not
i
take
away
the
little
book
and
be
done
with
it
he
would
have
been
frightened
and
he
would
have
told
his
master
then
we
should
miss
perhaps
a
great
number
of
new
rifles
which
seek
their
way
up
from
quetta
to
the
north
the
game
is
so
large
that
one
sees
but
a
little
at
a
time
said
kim
and
held
his
tongue
that
was
in
the
monsoon
holidays
after
he
had
taken
the
prize
for
mathematics
the
christmas
holidays
he
spent
deducting
ten
days
for
private
amusements
with
lurgan
sahib
where
he
sat
for
the
most
part
in
front
of
a
roaring
jakko
road
was
four
feet
deep
in
snow
that
year
and
the
small
hindu
had
gone
away
to
be
married
helped
lurgan
to
thread
pearls
he
made
kim
learn
whole
chapters
of
the
koran
by
heart
till
he
could
deliver
them
with
the
very
roll
and
cadence
of
a
mullah
moreover
he
told
kim
the
names
and
properties
of
many
native
drugs
as
well
as
the
runes
proper
to
recite
when
you
administer
them
and
in
the
evenings
he
wrote
charms
on
parchment
elaborate
pentagrams
crowned
with
the
names
of
devils
murra
and
awan
the
companion
of
kings
all
fantastically
written
in
the
corners
more
to
the
point
he
advised
kim
as
to
the
care
of
his
own
body
the
cure
of
and
simple
remedies
of
the
road
a
week
before
it
was
time
to
go
down
colonel
creighton
sahib
this
was
unfair
sent
kim
a
written
examination
paper
that
concerned
itself
solely
with
rods
and
chains
and
links
and
angles
next
holidays
he
was
out
with
mahbub
and
here
by
the
way
he
nearly
died
of
thirst
plodding
through
the
sand
on
a
camel
to
the
mysterious
city
of
bikanir
where
the
wells
are
four
hundred
feet
deep
and
lined
throughout
with
it
was
not
an
amusing
trip
from
point
of
view
because
in
defiance
of
the
contract
the
colonel
ordered
him
to
make
a
map
of
that
wild
walled
city
and
since
mohammedan
and
are
not
expected
to
drag
round
the
capital
of
an
independent
native
state
kim
was
forced
to
pace
all
his
distances
by
means
of
a
bead
rosary
he
used
the
compass
for
bearings
as
occasion
served
after
dark
chiefly
when
the
camels
had
been
fed
and
by
the
help
of
his
little
survey
of
six
and
three
brushes
he
achieved
something
not
remotely
unlike
the
city
of
jeysulmir
mahbub
laughed
a
great
deal
and
advised
him
to
make
up
a
written
report
as
well
and
in
the
back
of
the
big
that
lay
under
the
flap
of
mahbub
pet
saddle
kim
fell
to
must
hold
everything
that
thou
hast
seen
or
touched
or
considered
write
as
though
the
sahib
himself
had
come
by
stealth
with
a
vast
army
outsetting
to
war
great
an
army
half
a
lakh
of
men
remember
how
few
and
bad
were
the
wells
in
the
sand
not
a
thousand
thirsty
men
could
come
near
by
here
write
that

till
all

thou

there
is

good
lock
to
the
door
the
report
in
its
unmistakable
st
xavier
running
script
and
the
brown
yellow

map
was
on
hand
a
few
years
ago
a
careless
clerk
filed
it
with
the
rough
notes
of
e
second
seistan
survey
but
by
now
the
pencil
characters
must
be
almost
illegible
kim
translated
it
sweating
under
the
light
of
an
to
mahbub
the
second
day
of
their
the
pathan
rose
and
stooped
over
his
dappled
knew
it
would
be
worthy
a
dress
of
honour
and
so
i
made
one
ready
he
said
smiling
i
amir
of
afghanistan
and
some
day
we
may
see
him
i
would
fill
thy
mouth
with
gold
he
laid
the
garments
formally
at
kim
feet
there
was
a
peshawur
rising
to
a
cone
and
a
big
ending
in
a
broad
fringe
of
gold
there
was
a
delhi
embroidered
waistcoat
to
slip
over
a
milky
white
shirt
fastening
to
the
right
ample
and
flowing
green
pyjamas
with
twisted
silk
and
that
nothing
might
be
lacking
slippers
smelling
divinely
with
arrogantly
curled
tips
a
wednesday
and
in
the
morning
to
put
on
new
clothes
is
auspicious
said
mahbub
solemnly
we
must
not
forget
the
wicked
folk
in
the
world
so
he
capped
all
the
splendour
that
was
taking
kim
delighted
breath
away
with
a
revolver
had
thought
of
a
smaller
bore
but
reflected
that
this
takes
government
bullets
a
man
can
always
come
by
those
especially
across
the
border
stand
up
and
let
me
look
he
clapped
kim
on
the
shoulder
you
never
be
tired
pathan
oh
the
hearts
to
be
broken
oh
the
eyes
under
the
eyelashes
looking
sideways
kim
turned
about
pointed
his
toes
stretched
and
felt
mechanically
for
the
moustache
that
was
just
beginning
then
he
stooped
towards
mahbub
feet
to
make
proper
acknowledgment
with
fluttering
hands
his
heart
too
full
for
words
mahbub
forestalled
and
embraced
him
son
said
he
need
of
words
between
us
but
is
not
the
little
gun
a
delight
all
six
cartridges
come
out
at
one
twist
it
is
borne
in
the
bosom
next
the
skin
which
as
it
were
keeps
it
oiled
never
put
it
elsewhere
and
please
god
thou
shalt
some
day
kill
a
man
with
it
mai
said
kim
ruefully
a
sahib
kills
a
man
he
is
hanged
in
the
jail
but
one
pace
beyond
the
border
men
are
wiser
put
it
away
but
fill
it
first
of
what
use
is
a
gun
unfed
i
go
back
to
the
madrissah
i
must
return
it
they
do
not
allow
little
guns
thou
wilt
keep
it
for
me
i
am
wearied
of
that
madrissah
where
they
take
the
best
years
of
a
man
to
teach
him
what
he
can
only
learn
upon
the
road
the
folly
of
the
sahibs
has
neither
top
nor
bottom
no
matter
maybe
thy
written
report
shall
save
thee
further
bondage
and
god
he
knows
we
need
men
more
and
more
in
the
game
they
marched
against
blowing
sand
across
the
salt
desert
to
jodhpur
where
mahbub
and
his
handsome
nephew
habib
ullah
did
much
trading
and
then
sorrowfully
in
european
clothes
which
he
was
fast
outgrowing
kim
went
to
st
xavier
three
weeks
later
colonel
creighton
pricing
tibetan
at
lurgan
shop
faced
mahbub
ali
openly
mutinous
lurgan
sahib
operated
as
support
in
reserve
pony
is
made
finished
mouthed
and
paced
sahib
from
now
on
day
by
day
he
will
lose
his
manners
if
he
is
kept
at
tricks
drop
the
rein
on
his
back
and
let
go
said
the
need
him
he
is
so
young
mahbub
not
more
than
sixteen
is
he
i
was
fifteen
i
had
shot
my
man
and
begot
my
man
sahib
impenitent
old
heathen
creighton
turned
to
lurgan
the
black
beard
nodded
assent
to
the
wisdom
of
the
afghan
dyed
scarlet
should
have
used
him
long
ago
said
lurgan
younger
the
better
that
is
why
i
always
have
my
really
valuable
jewels
watched
by
a
child
you
sent
him
to
me
to
try
i
tried
him
in
every
way
he
is
the
only
boy
i
could
not
make
to
see
things
the
crystal
in
the
demanded
mahbub
under
my
hand
as
i
told
you
that
has
never
happened
before
it
means
that
he
is
strong
enough
but
you
think
it
skittles
colonel
creighton
to
make
anyone
do
anything
he
wants
and
that
is
three
years
ago
i
have
taught
him
a
good
deal
since
colonel
creighton
i
think
you
waste
him
now
maybe
you
right
but
as
you
know
there
is
no
survey
work
for
him
at
present
him
out
let
him
go
mahbub
interrupted
expects
any
colt
to
carry
heavy
weight
at
first
let
him
run
with
the
caravans
like
our
white
for
luck
i
would
take
him
myself
but
is
a
little
business
where
he
would
be
most
useful
in
the
south
said
lurgan
with
peculiar
suavity
dropping
his
heavy
blued
eyelids
has
that
in
hand
said
creighton
quickly
must
not
go
down
there
besides
he
knows
no
turki
tell
him
the
shape
and
the
smell
of
the
letters
we
want
and
he
will
bring
them
back
lurgan
insisted
that
is
a
man
job
said
creighton
it
was
a
matter
of
unauthorized
and
incendiary
correspondence
between
a
person
who
claimed
to
be
the
ultimate
authority
in
all
matters
of
the
mohammedan
religion
throughout
the
world
and
a
younger
member
of
a
royal
house
who
had
been
brought
to
book
for
kidnapping
women
within
british
territory
the
moslem
archbishop
had
been
emphatic
and
the
young
prince
was
merely
sulky
at
the
curtailment
of
his
privileges
but
there
was
no
need
he
should
continue
a
correspondence
which
might
some
day
compromise
him
one
letter
indeed
had
been
procured
but
the
finder
was
later
found
dead
by
the
roadside
in
the
habit
of
an
arab
trader
as
taking
up
the
work
duly
reported
these
facts
and
a
few
others
not
to
be
published
made
both
mahbub
and
creighton
shake
their
heads
him
go
out
with
his
red
lama
said
the
with
visible
effort
is
fond
of
the
old
man
he
can
learn
his
paces
by
the
rosary
at
least
have
had
some
dealings
with
the
old
man
by
letter
said
colonel
creighton
smiling
to
himself
goes
he
and
down
the
land
as
he
has
these
three
years
he
seeks
a
river
of
healing
god
curse
upon
all
mahbub
checked
himself
beds
down
at
the
temple
of
the
tirthankars
or
at
buddh
gaya
when
he
is
in
from
the
road
then
he
goes
to
see
the
boy
at
the
madrissah
as
we
know
for
the
boy
was
punished
for
it
twice
or
thrice
he
is
quite
mad
but
a
peaceful
man
i
have
met
him
the
babu
also
has
had
dealings
with
him
we
have
watched
him
for
three
years
red
lamas
are
not
so
common
in
hind
that
one
loses
track
are
very
curious
said
lurgan
meditatively
you
know
what
hurree
babu
really
wants
he
wants
to
be
made
a
member
of
the
royal
society
by
taking
ethnological
notes
i
tell
you
i
tell
him
about
the
lama
everything
which
mahbub
and
the
boy
have
told
me
hurree
babu
goes
down
to
benares
at
his
own
expense
i
think
do
said
creighton
briefly
he
had
paid
hurree
travelling
expenses
out
of
a
most
lively
curiosity
to
learn
what
the
lama
might
be
he
applies
to
the
lama
for
information
on
lamaism
and
and
spells
and
charms
several
times
in
these
few
years
holy
virgin
i
could
have
told
him
all
that
yeears
ago
i
think
hurree
babu
is
getting
too
old
for
the
road
he
likes
better
to
collect
manners
and
customs
information
yes
he
wants
to
be
an
frs
thinks
well
of
the
boy
does
he
very
indeed
we
have
had
some
pleasant
evenings
at
my
little
place
but
i
think
it
would
be
waste
to
throw
him
away
with
hurree
on
the
ethnological
side
for
a
first
experience
how
does
that
strike
you
mahbub
let
the
boy
run
with
the
lama
for
six
months
after
that
we
can
see
he
will
get
experience
has
it
already
sahib
as
a
fish
controls
the
water
he
swims
in
but
for
every
reason
it
will
be
well
to
loose
him
from
the
school
good
then
said
creighton
half
to
himself
can
go
with
the
lama
and
if
hurree
babu
cares
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
so
much
the
better
he
wo
lead
the
boy
into
any
danger
as
mahbub
would
curious
his
wish
to
be
an
f
r
very
human
too
he
is
best
on
the
ethnological
side
hurree
no
money
and
no
preferment
would
have
drawn
creighton
from
his
work
on
the
indian
survey
but
deep
in
his
heart
also
lay
the
ambition
to
write
r
s
after
his
name
honours
of
a
sort
he
knew
could
be
obtained
by
ingenuity
and
the
help
of
friends
but
to
the
best
of
his
belief
nothing
save
work
papers
representing
a
life
of
it
took
a
man
into
the
society
which
he
had
bombarded
for
years
with
monographs
on
strange
asiatic
cults
and
unknown
customs
nine
men
out
of
ten
would
flee
from
a
royal
society
soiree
in
extremity
of
boredom
but
creighton
was
the
tenth
and
at
times
his
soul
yearned
for
the
crowded
rooms
in
easy
london
where
gentlemen
who
know
nothing
of
the
army
move
among
spectroscopic
experiments
the
lesser
plants
of
the
frozen
tundras
electric
machines
and
apparatus
for
slicing
into
fractional
millimetres
the
left
eye
of
the
female
mosquito
by
all
right
and
reason
it
was
the
royal
geographical
that
should
have
appealed
to
him
but
men
are
as
chancy
as
children
in
their
choice
of
playthings
so
creighton
smiled
and
thought
the
better
of
hurree
babu
moved
by
like
desire
he
dropped
the
and
looked
up
at
mahbub
soon
can
we
get
the
colt
from
the
stable
said
the
reading
his
eyes
if
i
withdraw
him
by
order
now
what
will
he
do
think
you
i
have
never
before
assisted
at
the
teaching
of
such
an
one
will
come
to
me
said
mahbub
promptly
sahib
and
i
will
prepare
him
for
the
road
be
it
then
for
six
months
he
shall
run
at
his
choice
but
who
will
be
his
sponsor
lurgan
slightly
inclined
his
head
will
not
tell
anything
if
that
is
what
you
are
afraid
of
colonel
creighton
only
a
boy
after
all
but
first
he
has
nothing
to
tell
and
secondly
he
knows
what
would
happen
also
he
is
very
fond
of
mahbub
and
of
me
a
little
he
draw
pay
demanded
the
practical
and
water
allowance
only
twenty
rupees
a
month
one
advantage
of
the
secret
service
is
that
it
has
no
worrying
audit
that
service
is
ludicrously
starved
of
course
but
the
funds
are
administered
by
a
few
men
who
do
not
call
for
vouchers
or
present
itemized
accounts
mahbub
eyes
lighted
with
almost
a
sikh
love
of
money
even
lurgan
impassive
face
changed
he
considered
the
years
to
come
when
kim
would
have
been
entered
and
made
to
the
great
game
that
never
ceases
day
and
night
throughout
india
he
foresaw
honour
and
credit
in
the
mouths
of
a
chosen
few
coming
to
him
from
his
pupil
lurgan
sahib
had
made
what
was
out
of
a
bewildered
impertinent
lying
little
province
man
but
the
joy
of
these
masters
was
pale
and
smoky
beside
the
joy
of
kim
when
st
xavier
head
called
him
aside
with
word
that
colonel
creighton
had
sent
for
him
understand
that
he
has
found
you
a
place
as
an
assistant
in
the
canal
department
that
comes
of
taking
up
mathematics
it
is
great
luck
for
you
for
you
are
only
sixteen
but
of
course
you
understand
that
you
do
not
become
pukka
permanent
till
you
have
passed
the
autumn
examination
so
you
must
not
think
you
are
going
out
into
the
world
to
enjoy
yourself
or
that
your
fortune
is
made
there
is
a
great
deal
of
hard
work
before
you
only
if
you
succeed
in
becoming
pukka
you
can
rise
you
know
to
four
hundred
and
fifty
a
month
whereat
the
principal
gave
him
much
good
advice
as
to
his
conduct
and
his
manners
and
his
morals
and
others
his
elders
who
had
not
been
wafted
into
billets
talked
as
only
lads
can
of
favouritism
and
corruption
indeed
young
cazalet
whose
father
was
a
pensioner
at
chunar
hinted
very
broadly
that
colonel
creighton
interest
in
kim
was
directly
paternal
and
kim
instead
of
retaliating
did
not
even
use
language
he
was
thinking
of
the
immense
fun
to
come
of
mahbub
letter
of
the
day
before
all
neatly
written
in
english
making
appointment
for
that
afternoon
in
a
house
the
very
name
of
which
would
have
crisped
the
principal
hair
with
horror
said
kim
to
mahbub
in
lucknow
railway
station
that
evening
above
the
feared
lest
at
the
last
the
roof
would
fall
upon
me
and
cheat
me
it
is
indeed
all
finished
o
my
father
mahbub
snapped
his
fingers
to
show
the
utterness
of
that
end
and
his
eyes
blazed
like
red
coals
where
is
the
pistol
that
i
may
wear
it
a
to
run
without
i
begged
that
much
from
colonel
creighton
sahib
at
twenty
rupees
a
month
old
red
hat
knows
that
thou
art
coming
will
pay
thee
dustoorie
commission
on
my
pay
for
three
months
said
kim
gravely
two
rupees
a
month
but
first
we
must
get
rid
of
these
he
plucked
his
thin
linen
trousers
and
dragged
at
his
collar
have
brought
with
me
all
that
i
need
on
the
road
my
trunk
has
gone
up
to
lurgan
sahib
sends
his
salaams
to
thee
sahib
sahib
is
a
very
clever
man
but
what
dost
thou
do
go
north
again
upon
the
great
game
what
else
is
thy
mind
still
set
on
following
old
red
hat
not
forget
he
made
me
that
i
am
though
he
did
not
know
it
year
by
year
he
sent
the
money
that
taught
me
would
have
done
as
much
had
it
struck
my
thick
head
mahbub
growled
away
the
lamps
are
lit
now
and
none
will
mark
thee
in
the
bazar
we
go
to
huneefa
house
on
the
way
thither
mahbub
gave
him
much
the
same
sort
of
advice
as
his
mother
gave
to
lemuel
and
curiously
enough
mahbub
was
exact
to
point
out
how
huneefa
and
her
likes
destroyed
kings
i
remember
he
quoted
maliciously
who
said
trust
a
snake
before
an
harlot
and
an
harlot
before
a
pathan
mahbub
ali
now
excepting
as
to
pathans
of
whom
i
am
one
all
that
is
true
most
true
is
it
in
the
great
game
for
it
is
by
means
of
women
that
all
plans
come
to
ruin
and
we
lie
out
in
the
dawning
with
our
throats
cut
so
it
happened
to
such
a
one
he
gave
the
reddest
particulars
why
kim
paused
before
a
filthy
staircase
that
climbed
to
the
warm
darkness
of
an
upper
chamber
in
the
ward
that
is
behind
azim
ullah
those
who
know
it
call
it
the
birdcage
it
is
so
full
of
whisperings
and
whistlings
and
chirrupings
the
room
with
its
dirty
cushions
and
hookahs
smelt
abominably
of
stale
tobacco
in
one
corner
lay
a
huge
and
shapeless
woman
clad
in
greenish
gauzes
and
decked
brow
nose
ear
neck
wrist
arm
waist
and
ankle
with
heavy
native
jewellery
when
she
turned
it
was
like
the
clashing
of
copper
pots
a
lean
cat
in
the
balcony
outside
the
window
mewed
hungrily
kim
checked
bewildered
at
the
that
the
new
stuff
mahbub
said
huneefa
lazily
scarce
troubling
to
remove
the
mouthpiece
from
her
lips
buktanoos
like
most
of
her
kind
she

mahbub
explained
to
kim
who
laughed
have
heard
that
talk
since
my
sixth
day
he
replied
squatting
by
the
light
does
it
lead
protection
tonight
we
change
thy
colour
this
sleeping
under
roofs
has
blanched
thee
like
an
almond
but
huneefa
has
the
secret
of
a
colour
that
catches
no
painting
of
a
day
or
two
also
we
fortify
thee
against
the
chances
of
the
road
that
is
my
gift
to
thee
my
son
take
out
all
metals
on
thee
and
lay
them
here

huneefa
kim
dragged
forth
his
compass
survey
and
the
they
had
all
accompanied
his
travels
and
boylike
he
valued
them
immensely
the
woman
rose
slowly
and
moved
with
her
hands
a
little
spread
before
her
then
kim
saw
that
she
was
blind
no
she
muttered
pathan
speaks
truth
my
colour
does
not
go
in
a
week
or
a
month
and
those
whom
i
protect
are
under
strong
guard
one
is
far
off
and
alone
it
would
not
be
well
to
grow
blotched
and
leprous
of
a
sudden
said
mahbub
thou
wast
with
me
i
could
oversee
the
matter
besides
a
pathan
is
a
strip
to
the
waist
now
and
look
how
thou
art
whitened
huneefa
felt
her
way
back
from
an
inner
room
is
no
matter
she
can
not
see
he
took
a
pewter
bowl
from
her
ringed
hand
the
showed
blue
and
gummy
kim
experimented
on
the
back
of
his
wrist
with
a
dab
of
but
huneefa
heard
him
no
she
cried
thing
is
not
done
thus
but
with
the
proper
ceremonies
the
colouring
is
the
least
part
i
give
thee
the
full
protection
of
the
road
magic
kim
with
a
half
start
he
did
not
like
the
white
sightless
eyes
mahbub
hand
on
his
neck
bowed
him
to
the
floor
nose
within
an
inch
of
the
boards
still
no
harm
comes
to
thee
my
son
i
am
thy
sacrifice
he
could
not
see
what
the
woman
was
about
but
heard
the
of
her
jewellery
for
many
minutes
a
match
lit
up
the
darkness
he
caught
the
purr
and
fizzle
of
grains
of
incense
then
the
room
filled
with
smoke
heavy
aromatic
and
stupefying
through
growing
drowse
he
heard
the
names
of
devils
of
zulbazan
son
of
eblis
who
lives
in
bazars
and
paraos
making
all
the
sudden
lewd
wickedness
of
wayside
halts
of
dulhan
invisible
about
mosques
the
dweller
among
the
slippers
of
the
faithful
who
hinders
folk
from
their
prayers
and
musboot

of
lies
and
panic
huneefa
now
whispering
in
his
ear
now
talking
as
from
an
immense
distance
touched
him
with
horrible
soft
fingers
but
mahbub
grip
never
shifted
from
his
neck
till
relaxing
with
a
sigh
the
boy
lost
his
senses
how
he
fought
we
should
never
have
done
it
but
for
the
drugs
that
was
his
white
blood
i
take
it
said
mahbub
testily
on
with
the
dawut
invocation
give
him
full
protection
hearer
thou
that
hearest
with

o

huneefa
moaned
her
dead
eyes
turned
to
the
west
the
dark
room
filled
with
moanings
and
snortings
from
the
outer
balcony
a
ponderous
figure
raised
a
round
bullet
head
and
coughed
nervously
not
interrupt
this
ventriloquial
necromanciss
my
friend
it
said
in
english
opine
that
it
is
very
disturbing
to
you
but
no
enlightened
observer
is
upset
will
lay
a
plot
for
their
ruin
o
prophet
bear
with
the
unbelievers
let
them
alone
awhile
huneefa
face
turned
to
the
northward
worked
horribly
and
it
was
as
though
voices
from
the
ceiling
answered
her
hurree
babu
returned
to
his
balanced
on
the
but
his
hand
shook
huneefa
in
some
sort
of
drugged
ecstasy
wrenched
herself
to
and
fro
as
she
sat
by
kim
still
head
and
called
upon
devil
after
devil
in
the
ancient
order
of
the
ritual
binding
them
to
avoid
the
boy
every
action
him
are
the
keys
of
the
secret
things
none
knoweth
them
besides
himself
he
knoweth
that
which
is
in
the
dry
land
and
in
the
sea
again
broke
out
the
unearthly
whistling
responses
i
apprehend
it
is
not
at
all
malignant
in
its
operation
said
the
babu
watching
the
quiver
and
jerk
as
huneefa
spoke
with
tongues
it
is
not
likely
that
she
has
killed
the
boy
if
so
i
decline
to
be
witness
at
the
trial
was
the
last
hypothetical
devil
mentioned
said
mahbub
in
the
vernacular
have
no
regard
for
the
devils
of
hind
but
the
sons
of
eblis
are
far
otherwise
and
whether
they
be
jumalee
or
jullalee
terrible
they
love
not
kafirs
you
think
i
had
better
go
said
hurree
babu
half
rising
are
of
course
dematerialized
phenomena
spencer
says
huneefa
crisis
passed
as
these
things
must
in
a
paroxysm
of
howling
with
a
touch
of
froth
at
the
lips
she
lay
spent
and
motionless
beside
kim
and
the
crazy
voices
ceased
that
work
is
done
may
the
boy
be
better
for
it
and
huneefa
is
surely
a
mistress
of
dawut
help
haul
her
aside
babu
do
not
be
afraid
am
i
to
fear
the
absolutely
said
hurree
babu
talking
english
to
reassure
himself
it
is
an
awful
thing
still
to
dread
the
magic
that
you
contemptuously
investigate
to
collect
for
the
royal
society
with
a
lively
belief
in
all
powers
of
darkness
mahbub
chuckled
he
had
been
out
with
hurree
on
the
road
ere
now
us
finish
the
colouring
said
he
boy
is
well
protected
if
if
the
lords
of
the
air
have
ears
to
hear
i
am
a
sufi
but
when
one
can
get
of
a
woman
a
stallion
or
a
devil
why
go
round
to
invite
a
kick
set
him
upon
the
way
babu
and
see
that
old
red
hat
does
not
lead
him
beyond
our
reach
i
must
get
back
to
my
horses
raight
said
hurree
babu
is
at
present
curious
spectacle
about
third
cockcrow
kim
woke
after
a
sleep
of
thousands
of
years
huneefa
in
her
corner
snored
heavily
but
mahbub
was
gone
hope
you
were
not
frightened
said
an
oily
voice
at
his
elbow
superintended
entire
operation
which
was
most
interesting
from
ethnological
point
of
view
it
was
dawut
said
kim
recognizing
hurree
babu
who
smiled
ingratiatingly
also
i
had
honour
to
bring
down
from
lurgan
your
present
costume
i
am
not
in
the
habit
offeecially
of
carrying
such
gauds
to
subordinates
but
he
giggled
case
is
noted
as
exceptional
on
the
books
i
hope
mr
lurgan
will
note
my
action
kim
yawned
and
stretched
himself
it
was
good
to
turn
and
twist
within
loose
clothes
once
again
is
this
he
looked
curiously
at
the
heavy
loaded
with
the
scents
of
the
far
north
that
is
inconspicuous
dress
of
chela
attached
to
service
of
lamaistic
lama
complete
in
every
particular
said
hurree
babu
rolling
into
the
balcony
to
clean
his
teeth
at
a
goglet
am
of
opeenion
it
is
not
your
old
gentleman
precise
releegion
but
rather
of
same
i
have
contributed
rejected
notes
to
whom
it
may
concern
asiatic
quarterly
review
on
these
subjects
now
it
is
curious
that
the
old
gentleman
himself
is
totally
devoid
of
releegiosity
he
is
not
a
dam
particular
you
know
him
hurree
babu
held
up
his
hand
to
show
he
was
engaged
in
the
prescribed
rites
that
accompany
and
such
things
among
decently
bred
bengalis
then
he
recited
in
english
an
prayer
of
a
theistical
nature
and
stuffed
his
mouth
with
pan
and
betel
yes
i
have
met
him
several
times
at
benares
and
also
at
buddh
gaya
to
interrogate
him
on
releegious
points
and
he
is
pure
agnostic
same
as
me
huneefa
stirred
in
her
sleep
and
hurree
babu
jumped
nervously
to
the
copper
all
black
and
discoloured
in
rubbed
a
finger
in
the
accumulated
and
drew
it
diagonally
across
his
face
has
died
in
thy
house
asked
kim
in
the
vernacular
but
she
may
have
the
evil
eye
that
sorceress
the
babu
replied
dost
thou
do
now
then
will
set
thee
on
thy
way
to
benares
if
thou
goest
thither
and
tell
thee
what
must
be
known
by
us
go
at
what
hour
runs
the
he
rose
to
his
feet
looked
round
the
desolate
chamber
and
at
the
face
of
huneefa
as
the
low
sun
stole
across
the
floor
there
money
to
be
paid
that
witch
she
has
charmed
thee
against
all
devils
and
all
dangers
in
the
name
of
her
devils
it
was
mahbub
desire
in
english
is
highly
obsolete
i
think
to
indulge
in
such
supersteetion
why
it
is
all
ventriloquy
eh
kim
snapped
his
fingers
mechanically
to
avert
whatever
evil
mahbub
he
knew
meditated
none
might
have
crept
in
through
ministrations
and
hurree
giggled
once
more
but
as
he
crossed
the
room
he
was
careful
not
to
step
in
huneefa
blotched
squat
shadow
on
the
boards
witches
when
their
time
is
on
them
can
lay
hold
of
the
heels
of
a
man
soul
if
he
does
that
you
must
well
listen
said
the
babu
when
they
were
in
the
fresh
air
of
these
ceremonies
which
we
witnessed
they
include
supply
of
effeecient
amulet
to
those
of
our
department
if
you
feel
in
your
neck
you
will
find
one
small
silver
amulet
verree
cheap
that
is
ours
do
you
understand
yes
a
said
kim
feeling
at
his
neck
she
makes
them
for
two
rupees
twelve
annas
with
oh
all
sorts
of
exorcisms
they
are
quite
common
except
they
are
partially
black
enamel
and
there
is
a
paper
inside
each
one
full
of
names
of
local
saints
and
such
things
thatt
is
huneefa
you
see
huneefa
makes
them
onlee
for
us
but
in
case
she
does
not
when
we
get
them
we
put
in
before
issue
one
small
piece
of
turquoise
mr
lurgan
he
gives
them
there
is
no
other
source
of
supply
but
it
was
me
invented
all
this
it
is
strictly
unoffeecial
of
course
but
convenient
for
subordinates
colonel
creighton
he
does
not
know
he
is
european
the
turquoise
is
wrapped
in
the
paper
yes
that
is
road
to
railway
station
now
suppose
you
go
with
the
lama
or
with
me
i
hope
some
day
or
with
mahbub
suppose
we
get
into
a
place
i
am
a
fearful
man
most
fearful
but
i
tell
you
i
have
been
in
places
more
than
hairs
on
my
head
you
say
i
am
son
of
the
charm
verree
good
do
not
understand
quite
we
must
not
be
heard
talking
english
here
is
all
raight
i
am
only
babu
showing
off
my
english
to
you
all
we
babus
talk
english
to
show
off
said
hurree
flinging
his
jauntily
i
was
about
to
say
son
of
the
charm
means
that
you
may
be
member
of
the
sat
bhai
the
seven
brothers
which
is
hindi
and
tantric
it
is
popularly
supposed
to
be
extinct
society
but
i
have
written
notes
to
show
it
is
still
extant
you
see
it
is
all
my
invention
verree
good
sat
bhai
has
many
members
and
perhaps
before
they
they
may
give
you
just
a
chance
of
life
that
is
useful
anyhow
and
moreover
these
foolish
natives
if
they
are
not
too
excited
they
always
stop
to
think
before
they
kill
a
man
who
says
he
belongs
to
any
speecific
organization
you
see
you
say
then
when
you
are
in
tight
place
i
am
son
of
the
charm
and
you
get
perhaps
ah
your
second
wind
that
is
only
in
extreme
instances
or
to
open
negotiations
with
a
stranger
can
you
quite
see
verree
good
but
suppose
now
i
or
any
one
of
the
department
come
to
you
dressed
quite
different
you
would
not
know
me
at
all
unless
i
choose
i
bet
you
some
day
i
will
prove
it
i
come
as
ladakhi
trader
oh
anything
and
i
say
to
you
you
want
to
buy
precious
stones
you
say
do
i
look
like
a
man
who
buys
precious
stones
then
i
say
even
verree
poor
man
can
buy
a
turquoise
or
tarkeean
is
kichree
vegetable
curry
said
kim
course
it
is
you
say
let
me
see
the
tarkeean
then
i
say
it
was
cooked
by
a
woman
and
perhaps
it
is
bad
for
your
caste
then
you
say
there
is
no
caste
when
men
go
to
look
for
tarkeean
you
stop
a
little
between
those
words
to
look
that
is
thee
whole
secret
the
little
stop
before
the
words
kim
repeated
the
is
all
right
then
i
will
show
you
my
turquoise
if
there
is
time
and
then
you
know
who
i
am
and
then
we
exchange
views
and
documents
and
things
and
so
it
is
with
any
other
man
of
us
we
talk
sometimes
about
turquoises
and
sometimes
about
tarkeean
but
always
with
that
little
stop
in
the
words
it
is
verree
easy
first
son
of
the
charm
if
you
are
in
a
tight
place
perhaps
that
may
help
you
perhaps
not
then
what
i
have
told
you
about
the
tarkeean
if
you
want
to
transact
offeecial
business
with
a
strange
man
of
course
at
present
you
have
no
offeecial
business
you
are
ah
ha
supernumerary
on
probation
quite
unique
specimen
if
you
were
asiatic
of
birth
you
might
be
employed
right
off
but
this
of
leave
is
to
make
you
you
see
the
lama
he
expects
you
because
i
have
informed
him
you
have
passed
all
your
examinations
and
will
soon
obtain
government
appointment
oh
ho
you
are
on
you
see
so
if
you
are
called
upon
to
help
sons
of
the
charm
mind
you
try
now
i
shall
say
my
dear
fellow
and
i
hope
you
ah
will
come
out
all
raight
hurree
babu
stepped
back
a
pace
or
two
into
the
crowd
at
the
entrance
of
lucknow
station
and
was
gone
kim
drew
a
deep
breath
and
hugged
himself
all
over
the
revolver
he
could
feel
in
the
bosom
of
his
robe
the
amulet
was
on
his
neck
rosary
and
mr
lurgan
had
forgotten
nothing

all
to
hand
with
medicine
and
compass
and
in
a
worn
old
embroidered
with
patterns
lay
a
month
pay
kings
could
be
no
richer
he
bought
sweetmeats
in
a
from
a
hindu
trader
and
ate
them
with
glad
rapture
till
a
policeman
ordered
him
off
the
steps
chapter
give
the
man
who
is
not
made
to
his
trade
swords
to
fling
and
catch
again
coins
to
ring
and
snatch
again
men
to
harm
and
cure
again
snakes
to
charm
and
lure
again

be
hurt
by
his
own
blade
by
his
serpents
disobeyed
by
his
clumsiness
bewrayed
by
the
people
mocked
to
scorn

or
withered

the

op
followed
a
sudden
natural
reaction
am
i
alone
all
alone
he
thought
all

so
alone
as
i
if
i
die
today
who
shall
bring
the
news
and
to
whom
if
i
live
and
god
is
good
there
will
be
a
price
upon
my
head
for
i
am
a
son
of
the
charm
i
kim
a
very
few
white
people
but
many
asiatics
can
throw
themselves
into
a
mazement
as
it
were
by
repeating
their
own
names
over
and
over
again
to
themselves
letting
the
mind
go
free
upon
speculation
as
to
what
is
called
personal
identity
when
one
grows
older
the
power
usually
departs
but
while
it
lasts
it
may
descend
upon
a
man
at
any
moment
is
kim
kim
kim
he
squatted
in
a
corner
of
the
clanging
rapt
from
all
other
thoughts
hands
folded
in
lap
and
pupils
contracted
to
in
a
minute
in
another
he
felt
he
would
arrive
at
the
solution
of
the
tremendous
puzzle
but
here
as
always
happens
his
mind
dropped
away
from
those
heights
with
a
rush
of
a
wounded
bird
and
passing
his
hand
before
his
eyes
he
shook
his
head
a
hindu
bairagi
holy
man
who
had
just
bought
a
ticket
halted
before
him
at
that
moment
and
stared
intently
also
have
lost
it
he
said
sadly
is
one
of
the
gates
to
the
way
but
for
me
it
has
been
shut
many
years
is
the
talk
said
kim
abashed
wast
wondering
there
in
thy
spirit
what
manner
of
thing
thy
soul
might
be
the
seizure
came
of
a
sudden
i
know
who
should
know
but
i
whither
goest
thou
kashi
benares
are
no
gods
there
i
have
proved
them
i
go
to
prayag
allahabad
for
the
fifth
time
seeking
the
road
to
enlightenment
of
what
faith
art
thou
too
am
a
seeker
said
kim
using
one
of
the
lama
pet
words
he
forgot
his
northern
dress
for
the
moment
allah
alone
knoweth
what
i
seek
the
old
fellow
slipped
the
bairagi
crutch
under
his
armpit
and
sat
down
on
a
patch
of
ruddy
leopard
skin
as
kim
rose
at
the
call
for
the
benares
train
in
hope
little
brother
he
said
is
a
long
road
to
the
feet
of
the
one
but
thither
do
we
all
travel
kim
did
not
feel
so
lonely
after
this
and
ere
he
had
sat
out
twenty
miles
in
the
crowded
compartment
was
cheering
his
neighbours
with
a
string
of
most
wonderful
yarns
about
his
own
and
his
master
magical
gifts
benares
struck
him
as
a
peculiarly
filthy
city
though
it
was
pleasant
to
find
how
his
cloth
was
respected
at
least
of
the
population
prays
eternally
to
some
group
or
other
of
the
many
million
deities
and
so
reveres
every
sort
of
holy
man
kim
was
guided
to
the
temple
of
the
tirthankars
about
a
mile
outside
the
city
near
sarnath
by
a
punjabi
farmer
a
kamboh
from
who
had
appealed
in
vain
to
every
god
of
his
homestead
to
cure
his
small
son
and
was
trying
benares
as
a
last
resort
art
from
the
north
he
asked
shouldering
through
the
press
of
the
narrow
stinking
streets
much
like
his
own
pet
bull
at
home
i
know
the
punjab
my
mother
was
a
pahareen
but
my
father
came
from
amritzar
by
jandiala
said
kim
oiling
his
ready
tongue
for
the
needs
of
the
road
jullundur
oho
then
we
be
neighbours
in
some
sort
as
it
were
he
nodded
tenderly
to
the
wailing
child
in
his
arms
dost
thou
serve
most
holy
man
at
the
temple
of
the
tirthankers
are
all
most
holy
and
most
greedy
said
the
jat
with
bitterness
have
walked
the
pillars
and
trodden
the
temples
till
my
feet
are
flayed
and
the
child
is
no
whit
better
and
the
mother
being
sick
too
hush
then
little
one
we
changed
his
name
when
the
fever
came
we
put
him
into
girl
clothes
there
was
nothing
we
did
not
do
except
i
said
to
his
mother
when
she
bundled
me
off
to
benares
she
should
have
come
with
me
i
said
sakhi
sarwar
sultan
would
serve
us
best
we
know
his
generosity
but
these
gods
are
strangers
the
child
turned
on
the
cushion
of
the
huge
corded
arms
and
looked
at
kim
through
heavy
eyelids
was
it
all
worthless
kim
asked
with
easy
interest
worthless
all
worthless
said
the
child
lips
cracking
with
fever
gods
have
given
him
a
good
mind
at
least
said
the
father
proudly
think
he
should
have
listened
so
cleverly
yonder
is
thy
temple
now
i
am
a
poor
man
many
priests
have
dealt
with
me
but
my
son
is
my
son
and
if
a
gift
to
thy
master
can
cure
him
i
am
at
my
very
wits
end
kim
considered
for
a
while
tingling
with
pride
three
years
ago
he
would
have
made
prompt
profit
on
the
situation
and
gone
his
way
without
a
thought
but
now
the
very
respect
the
jat
paid
him
proved
that
he
was
a
man
moreover
he
had
tasted
fever
once
or
twice
already
and
knew
enough
to
recognize
starvation
when
he
saw
it
him
forth
and
i
will
give
him
a
bond
on
my
best
yoke
so
that
the
child
is
cured
kim
halted
at
the
carved
outer
door
of
the
temple
a
oswal
banker
from
ajmir
his
sins
of
usury
new
wiped
out
asked
him
what
he
did
am
chela
to
teshoo
lama
an
holy
one
from
bhotiyal
within
there
he
bade
me
come
i
wait
tell
him
not
forget
the
child
cried
the
importunate
jat
over
his
shoulder
and
then
bellowed
in
punjabi
holy
one
o
disciple
of
the
holy
one
o
gods
above
all
the
worlds
behold
affliction
sitting
at
the
gate
that
cry
is
so
common
in
benares
that
the
passers
never
turned
their
heads
the
oswal
at
peace
with
mankind
carried
the
message
into
the
darkness
behind
him
and
the
easy
uncounted
eastern
minutes
slid
by
for
the
lama
was
asleep
in
his
cell
and
no
priest
would
wake
him
when
the
click
of
his
rosary
again
broke
the
hush
of
the
inner
court
where
the
calm
images
of
the
arhats
stand
a
novice
whispered
chela
is
here
and
the
old
man
strode
forth
forgetting
the
end
of
that
prayer
hardly
had
the
tall
figure
shown
in
the
doorway
than
the
jat
ran
before
him
and
lifting
up
the
child
cried
upon
this
holy
one
and
if
the
gods
will
he
lives
he
lives
he
fumbled
in
his
and
drew
out
a
small
silver
coin
is
now
the
lama
eyes
turned
to
kim
it
was
noticeable
he
spoke
far
clearer
urdu
than
long
ago
under
zamzammah
but
father
would
allow
no
private
talk
is
no
more
than
a
fever
said
kim
child
is
not
well
fed
sickens
at
everything
and
his
mother
is
not
here
it
be
permitted
i
may
cure
holy
one
have
they
made
thee
a
healer
wait
here
said
the
lama
and
he
sat
down
by
the
jat
upon
the
lowest
step
of
the
temple
while
kim
looking
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
slowly
opened
the
little
he
had
dreamed
dreams
at
school
of
returning
to
the
lama
as
a
sahib
of
chaffing
the
old
man
before
he
revealed
himself
dreams
all
there
was
more
drama
in
this
abstracted
search
through
the
with
a
pause
here
and
there
for
thought
and
a
muttered
invocation
between
whiles
quinine
he
had
in
tablets
and
dark
brown
beef
most
probably
but
that
was
not
his
business
the
little
thing
would
not
eat
but
it
sucked
at
a
lozenge
greedily
and
said
it
liked
the
salt
taste
then
these
six
kim
handed
them
to
the
man
the
gods
and
boil
three
in
milk
other
three
in
water
after
he
has
drunk
the
milk
give
him
this
it
was
the
half
of
a
quinine
pill
wrap
him
warm
give
him
the
water
of
the
other
three
and
the
other
half
of
this
white
pill
when
he
wakes
meantime
here
is
another
brown
medicine
that
he
may
suck
at
on
the
way
home
what
wisdom
said
the
kamboh
snatching
it
was
as
much
as
kim
could
remember
of
his
own
treatment
in
a
bout
of
autumn
malaria
if
you
except
the
patter
that
he
added
to
impress
the
lama
go
come
again
in
the
morning
the
price
the
price
said
the
jat
and
threw
back
his
sturdy
shoulders
son
is
my
son
now
that
he
will
be
whole
again
how
shall
i
go
back
to
his
mother
and
say
i
took
help
by
the
wayside
and
did
not
even
give
a
bowl
of
curds
in
return
are
alike
these
jats
said
kim
softly
jat
stood
on
his
dunghill
and
the
king
elephants
went
by
o
driver
said
he
what
will
you
sell
those
little
donkeys
for
the
jat
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
stifled
with
apologies
to
the
lama
is
the
saying
of
my
own
country
the
very
talk
of
it
so
are
we
jats
all
i
will
come
tomorrow
with
the
child
and
the
blessing
of
the
gods
of
the
homesteads
who
are
good
little
gods
be
on
you
both
now
son
we
grow
strong
again
do
not
spit
it
out
little
princeling
king
of
my
heart
do
not
spit
it
out
and
we
shall
be
strong
men
wrestlers
and
by
morning
he
moved
away
crooning
and
mumbling
the
lama
turned
to
kim
and
all
the
loving
old
soul
of
him
looked
out
through
his
narrow
eyes
heal
the
sick
is
to
acquire
merit
but
first
one
gets
knowledge
that
was
wisely
done
o
friend
of
all
the
world
was
made
wise
by
thee
holy
one
said
kim
forgetting
the
little
play
just
ended
forgetting
st
xavier
forgetting
his
white
blood
forgetting
even
the
great
game
as
he
stooped
to
touch
his
master
feet
in
the
dust
of
the
jain
temple
teaching
i
owe
to
thee
i
have
eaten
thy
bread
three
years
my
time
is
finished
i
am
loosed
from
the
schools
i
come
to
thee
is
my
reward
enter
enter
and
is
all
well
they
passed
to
the
inner
court
where
the
afternoon
sun
sloped
golden
across
that
i
may
see
so
he
peered
critically
is
no
longer
a
child
but
a
man
ripened
in
wisdom
walking
as
a
physician
i
did
well
i
did
well
when
i
gave
thee
up
to
the
armed
men
on
that
black
night
dost
thou
remember
our
first
day
under
said
kim
thou
remember
when
i
leapt
off
the
carriage
the
first
day
i
went
to
gates
of
learning
truly
and
the
day
that
we
ate
the
cakes
together
at
the
back
of
the
river
by
nucklao
aha
many
times
hast
thou
begged
for
me
but
that
day
i
begged
for
thee
reason
quoth
kim
was
then
a
scholar
in
the
gates
of
learning
and
attired
as
a
sahib
do
not
forget
holy
one
he
went
on
playfully
am
still
a
sahib
by
thy
favour
and
a
sahib
in
most
high
esteem
come
to
my
cell
chela
is
that
known
to
thee
the
lama
smiled
by
means
of
letters
from
the
kindly
priest
whom
we
met
in
the
camp
of
armed
men
but
he
is
now
gone
to
his
own
country
and
i
sent
the
money
to
his
brother
colonel
creighton
who
had
succeeded
to
the
trusteeship
when
father
victor
went
to
england
with
the
mavericks
was
hardly
the
chaplain
brother
i
do
not
well
understand
sahibs
letters
they
must
be
interpreted
to
me
i
chose
a
surer
way
many
times
when
i
returned
from
my
search
to
this
temple
which
has
always
been
a
nest
to
me
there
came
one
seeking
enlightenment
a
man
from
leh
that
had
been
he
said
a
hindu
but
wearied
of
all
those
gods
the
lama
pointed
to
the
arhats
fat
man
said
kim
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
fat
but
i
perceived
in
a
little
his
mind
was
wholly
given
up
to
useless
things
such
as
devils
and
charms
and
the
form
and
fashion
of
our
in
the
monasteries
and
by
what
road
we
initiated
the
novices
a
man
abounding
in
questions
but
he
was
a
friend
of
thine
chela
he
told
me
that
thou
wast
on
the
road
to
much
honour
as
a
scribe
and
i
see
thou
art
a
physician
that
am
i
a
scribe
when
i
am
a
sahib
but
it
is
set
aside
when
i
come
as
thy
disciple
i
have
accomplished
the
years
appointed
for
a
sahib
it
were
a
novice
said
the
lama
nodding
his
head
thou
freed
from
the
schools
i
would
not
have
thee
unripe
am
all
free
in
due
time
i
take
service
under
the
government
as
a
scribe
as
a
warrior
that
is
well
first
i
come
to
wander
with
thee
therefore
i
am
here
who
begs
for
thee
these
days
he
went
on
quickly
the
ice
was
thin
often
i
beg
myself
but
as
thou
knowest
i
am
seldom
here
except
when
i
come
to
look
again
at
my
disciple
from
one
end
to
another
of
hind
have
i
travelled
afoot
and
in
the
a
great
and
a
wonderful
land
but
here
when
i
put
in
is
as
though
i
were
in
my
own
bhotiyal
he
looked
round
the
little
clean
cell
complacently
a
low
cushion
gave
him
a
seat
on
which
he
had
disposed
himself
in
the
attitude
of
the
bodhisat
emerging
from
meditation
a
black
table
not
twenty
inches
high
set
with
copper
was
before
him
in
one
corner
stood
a
tiny
altar
also
of
heavily
carved
teak
bearing
a
image
of
the
seated
buddha
and
fronted
by
a
lamp
an
and
a
pair
of
copper
keeper
of
the
images
in
the
wonder
house
acquired
merit
by
giving
me
these
a
year
since
he
said
following
kim
eye
one
is
far
from
one
own
land
such
things
carry
remembrance
and
we
must
reverence
the
lord
for
that
he
showed
the
way
see
he
pointed
to
a
mound
of
coloured
rice
crowned
with
a
fantastic
metal
ornament
i
was
abbot
in
my
own
place
before
i
came
to
better
knowledge
i
made
that
offering
daily
it
is
the
sacrifice
of
the
universe
to
the
lord
thus
do
we
of
bhotiyal
offer
all
the
world
daily
to
the
excellent
law
and
i
do
it
even
now
though
i
know
that
the
excellent
one
is
beyond
all
pinchings
and
pattings
he
snuffed
from
his
gourd
is
well
done
holy
one
kim
murmured
sinking
at
ease
on
the
cushions
very
happy
and
rather
tired
also
the
old
man
chuckled
write
pictures
of
the
wheel
of
life
three
days
to
a
picture
i
was
busied
on
it
or
it
may
be
i
shut
my
eyes
a
little
when
they
brought
word
of
thee
it
is
good
to
have
thee
here
i
will
show
thee
my
art
not
for
pride
sake
but
because
thou
must
learn
the
sahibs
have
not
all
this
world
wisdom
he
drew
from
under
the
table
a
sheet
of
strangely
scented
yellow
chinese
paper
the
brushes
and
slab
of
indian
ink
in
cleanest
severest
outline
he
had
traced
the
great
wheel
with
its
six
spokes
whose
centre
is
the
conjoined
hog
snake
and
dove
ignorance
anger
and
lust
and
whose
compartments
are
all
the
heavens
and
hells
and
all
the
chances
of
human
life
men
say
that
the
bodhisat
himself
first
drew
it
with
grains
of
rice
upon
dust
to
teach
his
disciples
the
cause
of
things
many
ages
have
crystallized
it
into
a
most
wonderful
convention
crowded
with
hundreds
of
little
figures
whose
every
line
carries
a
meaning
few
can
translate
the
there
are
not
twenty
in
all
the
world
who
can
draw
it
surely
without
a
copy
of
those
who
can
both
draw
and
expound
are
but
three
have
a
little
learned
to
draw
said
kim
this
is
a
marvel
beyond
marvels
have
written
it
for
many
years
said
the
lama
was
when
i
could
write
it
all
between
one
and
the
next
i
will
teach
thee
the
art
after
due
preparation
and
i
will
show
thee
the
meaning
of
the
wheel
take
the
road
then
road
and
our
search
i
was
but
waiting
for
thee
it
was
made
plain
to
me
in
a
hundred
dreams
notably
one
that
came
upon
the
night
of
the
day
that
the
gates
of
learning
first
shut
that
without
thee
i
should
never
find
my
river
again
and
again
as
thou
knowest
i
put
this
from
me
fearing
an
illusion
therefore
i
would
not
take
thee
with
me
that
day
at
lucknow
when
we
ate
the
cakes
i
would
not
take
thee
till
the
time
was
ripe
and
auspicious
from
the
hills
to
the
sea
from
the
sea
to
the
hills
have
i
gone
but
it
was
vain
then
i
remembered
the
tataka
he
told
kim
the
story
of
the
elephant
with
the
as
he
had
told
it
so
often
to
the
jam
priests
testimony
is
not
needed
he
ended
serenely
wast
sent
for
an
aid
that
aid
removed
my
search
came
to
naught
therefore
we
will
go
out
again
together
and
our
search
sure
go
we
matters
friend
of
all
the
world
the
search
i
say
is
sure
if
need
be
the
river
will
break
from
the
ground
before
us
i
acquired
merit
when
i
sent
thee
to
the
gates
of
learning
and
gave
thee
the
jewel
that
is
wisdom
thou
didst
return
i
saw
even
now
a
follower
of
sakyamuni
the
physician
whose
altars
are
many
in
bhotiyal
it
is
sufficient
we
are
together
and
all
things
are
as
they
were
friend
of
all
the
world
friend
of
the
stars
my
chela
then
they
talked
of
matters
secular
but
it
was
noticeable
that
the
lama
never
demanded
any
details
of
life
at
st
xavier
nor
showed
the
faintest
curiosity
as
to
the
manners
and
customs
of
sahibs
his
mind
moved
all
in
the
past
and
he
revived
every
step
of
their
wonderful
first
journey
together
rubbing
his
hands
and
chuckling
till
it
pleased
him
to
curl
himself
up
into
the
sudden
sleep
of
old
age
kim
watched
the
last
dusty
sunshine
fade
out
of
the
court
and
played
with
his
and
rosary
the
clamour
of
benares
oldest
of
all
earth
cities
awake
before
the
gods
day
and
night
beat
round
the
walls
as
the
sea
roar
round
a
breakwater
now
and
again
a
jain
priest
crossed
the
court
with
some
small
offering
to
the
images
and
swept
the
path
about
him
lest
by
chance
he
should
take
the
life
of
a
living
thing
a
lamp
twinkled
and
there
followed
the
sound
of
a
prayer
kim
watched
the
stars
as
they
rose
one
after
another
in
the
still
sticky
dark
till
he
fell
asleep
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
that
night
he
dreamed
in
hindustani
with
never
an
english
word
one
there
is
the
child
to
whom
we
gave
the
medicine
he
said
about
three
in
the
morning
when
the
lama
also
waking
from
dreams
would
have
fared
forth
on
pilgrimage
jat
will
be
here
at
the
light
am
well
answered
in
my
haste
i
would
have
done
a
wrong
he
sat
down
on
the
cushions
and
returned
to
his
rosary
old
folk
are
as
children
he
said
pathetically
desire
a
matter
behold
it
must
be
done
at
once
or
they
fret
and
weep
many
times
when
i
was
upon
the
road
i
have
been
ready
to
stamp
with
my
feet
at
the
hindrance
of
an
in
the
way
or
a
mere
cloud
of
dust
it
was
not
so
when
i
was
a
man
a
long
time
ago
none
the
less
it
is
wrongful
thou
art
indeed
old
holy
one
thing
was
done
a
cause
was
put
out
into
the
world
and
old
or
young
sick
or
sound
knowing
or
unknowing
who
can
rein
in
the
effect
of
that
cause
does
the
wheel
hang
still
if
a
child
spin
it
or
a
drunkard
chela
this
is
a
great
and
a
terrible
world
think
it
good
kim
yawned
is
there
to
eat
i
have
not
eaten
since
yesterday
even
had
forgotten
thy
need
yonder
is
good
bhotiyal
tea
and
cold
rice
can
not
walk
far
on
such
stuff
kim
felt
all
the
european
lust
for
which
is
not
accessible
in
a
jain
temple
yet
instead
of
going
out
at
once
with
the
he
stayed
his
stomach
on
slabs
of
cold
rice
till
the
full
dawn
it
brought
the
farmer
voluble
stuttering
with
gratitude
the
night
the
fever
broke
and
the
sweat
came
he
cried
here
his
skin
is
fresh
and
new
he
esteemed
the
salt
lozenges
and
took
milk
with
greed
he
drew
the
cloth
from
the
child
face
and
it
smiled
sleepily
at
kim
a
little
knot
of
jain
priests
silent
but
gathered
by
the
temple
door
they
knew
and
kim
knew
that
they
knew
how
the
old
lama
had
met
his
disciple
being
courteous
folk
they
had
not
obtruded
themselves
overnight
by
presence
word
or
gesture
wherefore
kim
repaid
them
as
the
sun
rose
the
gods
of
the
jains
brother
he
said
not
knowing
how
those
gods
were
named
fever
is
indeed
broken
see
the
lama
beamed
in
the
background
upon
his
hosts
of
three
years
there
ever
such
a
chela
he
follows
our
lord
the
healer
now
the
jains
officially
recognize
all
the
gods
of
the
hindu
creed
as
well
as
the
lingam
and
the
snake
they
wear
the
brahminical
thread
they
adhere
to
every
claim
of
hindu
but
because
they
knew
and
loved
the
lama
because
he
was
an
old
man
because
he
sought
the
way
because
he
was
their
guest
and
because
he
collogued
long
of
nights
with
the
as
a
metaphysician
as
ever
split
one
hair
into
seventy
they
murmured
assent
kim
bent
over
the
child
trouble
may
come
again
if
thou
hast
the
proper
spell
said
the
father
in
a
little
while
we
go
away
said
the
lama
to
all
the
jains
go
now
together
upon
the
search
whereof
i
have
often
spoken
i
waited
till
my
chela
was
ripe
behold
him
we
go
north
never
again
shall
i
look
upon
this
place
of
my
rest
o
people
of
good
will
i
am
not
a
beggar
the
cultivator
rose
to
his
feet
clutching
the
child
still
do
not
trouble
the
holy
one
a
priest
cried
kim
whispered
us
again
under
the
big
railway
bridge
and
for
the
sake
of
all
the
gods
of
our
punjab
bring
food
curry
pulse
cakes
fried
in
fat
and
sweetmeats
specially
sweetmeats
be
swift
the
pallor
of
hunger
suited
kim
very
well
as
he
stood
tall
and
slim
in
his
sweeping
robes
one
hand
on
his
rosary
and
the
other
in
the
attitude
of
benediction
faithfully
copied
from
the
lama
an
english
observer
might
have
said
that
he
looked
rather
like
the
young
saint
of
a
window
whereas
he
was
but
a
growing
lad
faint
with
emptiness
long
and
formal
were
the
farewells
thrice
ended
and
thrice
renewed
the
seeker
he
who
had
invited
the
lama
to
that
haven
from
tibet
a
hairless
ascetic
took
no
part
in
it
but
meditated
as
always
alone
among
the
images
the
others
were
very
human
pressing
small
comforts
upon
the
old
man
a
a
fine
new
iron
pencase
a
and
warning
him
against
the
dangers
of
the
world
without
and
prophesying
a
happy
end
to
the
search
meantime
kim
lonelier
than
ever
squatted
on
the
steps
and
swore
to
himself
in
the
language
of
st
xavier
it
is
my
own
fault
he
concluded
mahbub
i
ate
bread
or
lurgan
sahib
at
st
xavier
three
meals
a
day
here
i
must
look
out
for
myself
besides
i
am
not
in
good
training
how
i
could
eat
a
plate
of
beef
now
is
it
finished
holy
one
the
lama
both
hands
raised
intoned
a
final
blessing
in
ornate
chinese
must
lean
on
thy
shoulder
said
he
as
the
temple
gates
closed
grow
stiff
i
think
the
weight
of
a
man
is
not
light
to
steady
through
miles
of
crowded
streets
and
kim
loaded
down
with
bundles
and
packages
for
the
way
was
glad
to
reach
the
shadow
of
the
railway
bridge
we
eat
he
said
resolutely
as
the
kamboh
and
smiling
hove
in
sight
a
basket
in
one
hand
and
the
child
in
the
other
to
holy
ones
he
cried
from
fifty
yards
they
were
by
the
shoal
under
the
first
out
of
sight
of
hungry
priests
and
good
curry
cakes
all
warm
and
well
scented
with
hing
asafoetida
curds
and
sugar
king
of
my
fields
this
to
the
small
son
us
show
these
holy
men
that
we
jats
of
jullundur
can
pay
a
service
i
had
heard
the
jains
would
eat
nothing
that
they
had
not
cooked
but
truly
he
looked
away
politely
over
the
broad
river
there
is
no
eye
there
is
no
caste
we
said
kim
turning
his
back
and
heaping
a
leafplatter
for
the
lama
beyond
all
castes
they
gorged
themselves
on
the
good
food
in
silence
nor
till
he
had
licked
the
last
of
the
sticky
sweetstuff
from
his
little
finger
did
kim
note
that
the
kamboh
too
was
girt
for
travel
our
roads
lie
together
he
said
roughly
go
with
thee
one
does
not
often
find
a
worker
of
miracles
and
the
child
is
still
weak
but
i
am
not
altogether
a
reed
he
picked
up
his
lathi
a
ringed
with
bands
of
polished
iron
and
flourished
it
in
the
air
jats
are
called
but
that
is
not
true
except
when
we
are
crossed
we
are
like
our
own
buffaloes
be
it
said
kim
good
stick
is
a
good
reason
the
lama
gazed
placidly
where
in
long
smudged
perspective
the
ceaseless
columns
of
smoke
go
up
from
the
by
the
river
now
and
again
despite
all
municipal
regulations
the
fragment
of
a
body
bobbed
by
on
the
full
current
for
thee
said
the
kamboh
to
kim
drawing
the
child
into
his
hairy
breast
might
today
have
gone
thither
with
this
one
the
priests
tell
us
that
benares
is
holy
which
none
doubt
and
desirable
to
die
in
but
i
do
not
know
their
gods
and
they
ask
for
money
and
when
one
has
done
one
worship
a
vows
it
is
of
none
effect
except
one
do
another
wash
here
wash
there
pour
drink
lave
and
scatter
flowers
but
always
pay
the
priests
no
the
punjab
for
me
and
the
soil
of
the
for
the
best
soil
in
it
have
said
many
times
in
the
temple
i
think
that
if
need
be
the
river
will
open
at
our
feet
we
will
therefore
go
north
said
the
lama
rising
remember
a
pleasant
place
set
about
with
where
one
can
walk
in
meditation
and
the
air
is
cooler
there
it
comes
from
the
hills
and
the
snow
of
the
hills
is
the
name
said
kim
should
i
know
didst
thou
not
no
that
was
after
the
army
rose
out
of
the
earth
and
took
thee
away
i
abode
there
in
meditation
in
a
room
against
the
dovecot
except
when
she
talked
eternally
the
woman
from
kulu
that
is
by
saharunpore
kim
laughed
does
the
spirit
move
thy
master
does
he
go
afoot
for
the
sake
of
past
sins
the
jat
demanded
cautiously
is
a
far
cry
to
delhi
said
kim
will
beg
a
tikkut
for
the
one
does
not
own
to
the
possession
of
money
in
india
in
the
name
of
the
gods
let
us
take
the
my
son
is
best
in
his
mother
arms
the
government
has
brought
on
us
many
taxes
but
it
gives
us
one
good
thing
the
that
joins
friends
and
unites
the
anxious
a
wonderful
matter
is
the
they
all
piled
into
it
a
couple
of
hours
later
and
slept
through
the
heat
of
the
day
the
kamboh
plied
kim
with
ten
thousand
questions
as
to
the
lama
walk
and
work
in
life
and
received
some
curious
answers
kim
was
content
to
be
where
he
was
to
look
out
upon
the
flat
landscape
and
to
talk
to
the
changing
mob
of
even
today
tickets
and
are
dark
oppression
to
indian
rustics
they
do
not
understand
why
when
they
have
paid
for
a
magic
piece
of
paper
strangers
should
punch
great
pieces
out
of
the
charm
so
long
and
furious
are
the
debates
between
travellers
and
eurasian
kim
assisted
at
two
or
three
with
grave
advice
meant
to
darken
counsel
and
to
show
off
his
wisdom
before
the
lama
and
the
admiring
kamboh
but
at
somna
road
the
fates
sent
him
a
matter
to
think
upon
there
tumbled
into
the
compartment
as
the
train
was
moving
off
a
mean
lean
little
person
a
mahratta
so
far
as
kim
could
judge
by
the
cock
of
the
tight
turban
his
face
was
cut
his
muslin
was
badly
torn
and
one
leg
was
bandaged
he
told
them
that
a
had
upset
and
nearly
slain
him
he
was
going
to
delhi
where
his
son
lived
kim
watched
him
closely
if
as
he
asserted
he
had
been
rolled
over
and
over
on
the
earth
there
should
have
been
signs
of
on
the
skin
but
all
his
injuries
seemed
clean
cuts
and
a
mere
fall
from
a
cart
could
not
cast
a
man
into
such
extremity
of
terror
as
with
shaking
fingers
he
knotted
up
the
torn
cloth
about
his
neck
he
laid
bare
an
amulet
of
the
kind
called
a
of
the
heart
now
amulets
are
common
enough
but
they
are
not
generally
strung
on
copper
wire
and
still
fewer
amulets
bear
black
enamel
on
silver
there
were
none
except
the
kamboh
and
the
lama
in
the
compartment
which
luckily
was
of
an
old
type
with
solid
ends
kim
made
as
to
scratch
in
his
bosom
and
thereby
lifted
his
own
amulet
the
mahratta
face
changed
altogether
at
the
sight
and
he
disposed
the
amulet
fairly
on
his
breast
he
went
on
to
the
kamboh
was
in
haste
and
the
cart
driven
by
a
bastard
bound
its
wheel
in
a
and
besides
the
harm
done
to
me
there
was
lost
a
full
dish
of
tarkeean
i
was
not
a
son
of
the
charm
a
lucky
man
that
day
was
a
great
loss
said
the
kamboh
withdrawing
interest
his
experience
of
benares
had
made
him
suspicious
cooked
it
said
kim
woman
the
mahratta
raised
his
eyes
all
women
can
cook
tarkeean
said
the
kamboh
is
a
good
curry
as
i
know
yes
it
is
a
good
curry
said
the
mahratta
cheap
said
kim
what
about
caste
there
is
no
caste
where
men
go
to
look
for
tarkeean
the
mahratta
replied
in
the
prescribed
cadence
whose
service
art
thou
the
service
of
this
holy
one
kim
pointed
to
the
happy
drowsy
lama
who
woke
with
a
jerk
at
the
word
he
was
sent
from
heaven
to
aid
me
he
is
called
the
friend
of
all
the
world
he
is
also
called
the
friend
of
the
stars
he
walks
as
a
physician
his
time
being
ripe
great
is
his
wisdom
a
son
of
the
charm
said
kim
under
his
breath
as
the
kamboh
made
haste
to
prepare
a
pipe
lest
the
mahratta
should
beg
who
is
that
the
mahratta
asked
glancing
sideways
nervously
whose
child
i
we
have
cured
who
lies
under
great
debt
to
us
sit
by
the
window
man
from
jullundur
here
is
a
sick
one
i
have
no
desire
to
mix
with
wastrels
my
ears
are
not
long
i
am
not
a
woman
wishing
to
overhear
secrets
the
jat
slid
himself
heavily
into
a
far
corner
thou
anything
of
a
healer
i
am
ten
leagues
deep
in
calamity
cried
the
mahratta
picking
up
the
cue
man
is
cut
and
bruised
all
over
i
go
about
to
cure
him
kim
retorted
interfered
between
thy
babe
and
me
am
rebuked
said
the
kamboh
meekly
am
thy
debtor
for
the
life
of
my
son
thou
art
a
i
know
it
me
the
cuts
kim
bent
over
the
mahratta
neck
his
heart
nearly
choking
him
for
this
was
the
great
game
with
a
vengeance
tell
thy
tale
swiftly
brother
while
i
say
a
charm
come
from
the
south
where
my
work
lay
one
of
us
they
slew
by
the
roadside
hast
thou
heard
kim
shook
his
head
he
of
course
knew
nothing
of
e
predecessor
slain
down
south
in
the
habit
of
an
arab
trader
found
a
certain
letter
which
i
was
sent
to
seek
i
came
away
i
escaped
from
the
city
and
ran
to
mhow
so
sure
was
i
that
none
knew
i
did
not
change
my
face
at
mhow
a
woman
brought
charge
against
me
of
theft
of
jewellery
in
that
city
which
i
had
left
then
i
saw
the
cry
was
out
against
me
i
ran
from
mhow
by
night
bribing
the
police
who
had
been
bribed
to
hand
me
over
without
question
to
my
enemies
in
the
south
then
i
lay
in
old
chitor
city
a
week
a
penitent
in
a
temple
but
i
could
not
get
rid
of
the
letter
which
was
my
charge
i
buried
it
under
the
queen
stone
at
chitor
in
the
place
known
to
us
all
kim
did
not
know
but
not
for
worlds
would
he
have
broken
the
thread
chitor
look
you
i
was
all
in
kings
country
for
kotah
to
the
east
is
beyond
the
queen
law
and
east
again
lie
jaipur
and
gwalior
neither
love
spies
and
there
is
no
justice
i
was
hunted
like
a
wet
jackal
but
i
broke
through
at
bandakui
where
i
heard
there
was
a
charge
against
me
of
murder
in
the
city
i
had
left
of
the
murder
of
a
boy
they
have
both
the
corpse
and
the
witnesses
waiting
can
not
the
government
protect
of
the
game
are
beyond
protection
if
we
die
we
die
our
names
are
blotted
from
the
book
that
is
all
at
bandakui
where
lives
one
of
us
i
thought
to
slip
the
scent
by
changing
my
face
and
so
made
me
a
mahratta
then
i
came
to
agra
and
would
have
turned
back
to
chitor
to
recover
the
letter
so
sure
i
was
i
had
slipped
them
therefore
i
did
not
send
a
tar
telegram
to
any
one
saying
where
the
letter
lay
i
wished
the
credit
of
it
all
kim
nodded
he
understood
that
feeling
well
at
agra
walking
in
the
streets
a
man
cried
a
debt
against
me
and
approaching
with
many
witnesses
would
hale
me
to
the
courts
then
and
there
oh
they
are
clever
in
the
south
he
recognized
me
as
his
agent
for
cotton
may
he
burn
in
hell
for
it
wast
thou
fool
i
was
the
man
they
sought
for
the
matter
of
the
letter
i
ran
into
the
fleshers
ward
and
came
out
by
the
house
of
the
jew
who
feared
a
riot
and
pushed
me
forth
i
came
afoot
to
somna
road
i
had
only
money
for
my
tikkut
to
delhi
and
there
while
i
lay
in
a
ditch
with
a
fever
one
sprang
out
of
the
bushes
and
beat
me
and
cut
me
and
searched
me
from
head
to
foot
within
earshot
of
the
terain
it
was
did
he
not
slay
thee
out
of
hand
are
not
so
foolish
if
i
am
taken
in
delhi
at
the
instance
of
lawyers
upon
a
proven
charge
of
murder
my
body
is
handed
over
to
the
state
that
desires
it
i
go
back
guarded
and
then
i
die
slowly
for
an
example
to
the
rest
of
us
the
south
is
not
my
country
i
run
in
circles
like
a
goat
with
one
eye
i
have
not
eaten
for
two
days
i
am
marked
he
touched
the
filthy
bandage
on
his
leg
that
they
will
know
me
at
delhi
art
safe
in
the
at
least
a
year
at
the
great
game
and
tell
me
that
again
the
wires
will
be
out
against
me
at
delhi
describing
every
tear
and
rag
upon
me
twenty
a
hundred
if
need
be
will
have
seen
me
slay
that
boy
and
thou
art
useless
kim
knew
enough
of
native
methods
of
attack
not
to
doubt
that
the
case
would
be
deadly
complete
even
to
the
corpse
the
mahratta
twitched
his
fingers
with
pain
from
time
to
time
the
kamboh
in
his
corner
glared
sullenly
the
lama
was
busy
over
his
beads
and
kim
fumbling
at
the
man
neck
thought
out
his
plan
between
invocations
thou
a
charm
to
change
my
shape
else
i
am
dead
five
ten
minutes
alone
if
i
had
not
been
so
pressed
and
i
might
he
cured
yet
said
the
kamboh
jealously
hast
chanted
long
enough
there
is
no
cure
for
his
hurts
as
i
see
except
he
sit
for
three
days
in
the
habit
of
a
bairagi
this
is
a
common
penance
often
imposed
on
a
fat
trader
by
his
spiritual
teacher
priest
always
goes
about
to
make
another
priest
was
the
retort
like
most
grossly
superstitious
folk
the
kamboh
could
not
keep
his
tongue
from
deriding
his
church
thy
son
be
a
priest
then
it
is
time
he
took
more
of
my
quinine
jats
are
all
buffaloes
said
the
kamboh
softening
anew
kim
rubbed
a
of
bitterness
on
the
child
trusting
little
lips
have
asked
for
nothing
he
said
sternly
to
the
father
food
dost
thou
grudge
me
that
i
go
to
heal
another
man
have
i
thy
leave
prince
up
flew
the
man
huge
paws
in
supplication
nay
do
not
mock
me
thus
pleases
me
to
cure
this
sick
one
thou
shalt
acquire
merit
by
aiding
what
colour
ash
is
there
in
thy
white
that
is
auspicious
was
there
raw
turmeric
among
thy
foodstuffs
i
thy

it
was
the

collection
of
small
oddments

of

a
clothful
of
atta
greyish
native
flour
twists
of
tobacco
tawdry
and
a
packet
of
all
wrapped
in
a
quilt
kim
turned
it
over
with
the
air
of
a
wise
warlock
muttering
a
mohammedan
invocation
is
wisdom
i
learned
from
the
sahibs
he
whispered
to
the
lama
and
here
when
one
thinks
of
his
training
at
lurgan
he
spoke
no
more
than
the
truth
is
a
great
evil
in
this
man
fortune
as
shown
by
the
stars
which
which
troubles
him
shall
i
take
it
away
of
the
stars
thou
hast
done
well
in
all
things
let
it
be
at
thy
pleasure
is
it
another
healing
be
quick
gasped
the
mahratta
train
may
stop
healing
against
the
shadow
of
death
said
kim
mixing
the
flour
with
the
mingled
charcoal
and
tobacco
ash
in
the
bowl
of
the
pipe
e
without
a
word
slipped
off
his
turban
and
shook
down
his
long
black
hair

the
jat
growled

in
the
temple

dared
to
look

thus
far

flinched
at

wholly
in

i
curse
thee
or

he
picked
up
the
outer
cloth
of
the
bundle
and
threw
it
over
the
bowed
head
so
much
as
to
think
a
wish
to
see
and
and
even
i
can
not
save
thee
sit

thy
scheme

said
kim
plucking
the
thin
hesitated
with
all
a
man
dislike
of
baring
his
body
is
caste
to
a
cut
throat
said
kim
rending
it
to
the
waist
must
make
thee
a
yellow
saddhu
all
over
strip
strip
swiftly
and
shake
thy
hair
over
thine
eyes
while
i
scatter
the
ash
now
a
on
thy
forehead
he
drew
from
his
bosom
the
little
survey
and
a
cake
of
crimson
lake
thou
only
a
beginner
said
labouring
literally
for
the
dear
life
as
he
slid
out
of
his
and
stood
clear
in
the
while
kim
splashed
in
a
noble
on
the
brow
two
days
entered
to
the
game
brother
kim
replied
more
ash
on
the
bosom
thou
met
a
physician
of
sick
pearls
he
switched
out
his
long
and
with
swiftest
hands
rolled
it
over
and
under
about
his
loins
into
the
intricate
devices
of
a
saddhu
cincture
dost
thou
know
his
touch
then
he
was
my
teacher
for
a
while
we
must
bar
thy
legs
ash
cures
wounds
smear
it
again
was
his
pride
once
but
thou
art
almost
better
the
gods
are
kind
to
us
give
me
that
it
was
a
tin
box
of
opium
pills
among
the
rubbish
of
the
jat
bundle
gulped
down
a
half
handful
are
good
against
hunger
fear
and
chill
and
they
make
the
eyes
red
too
he
explained
i
shall
have
heart
to
play
the
game
we
lack
only
a
saddhu
tongs
what
of
the
old
clothes
kim
rolled
them
small
and
stuffed
them
into
the
slack
folds
of
his
tunic
with
a
paint
cake
he
smeared
the
legs
and
the
breast
great
streaks
against
the
background
of
flour
ash
and
turmeric
blood
on
them
is
enough
to
hang
thee
brother
but
no
need
to
throw
them
out
of
the
window
it
is
finished
his
voice
thrilled
with
a
boy
pure
delight
in
the
game
and
look
o
jat
gods
protect
us
said
the
hooded
kamboh
emerging
like
a
buffalo
from
the
reeds
whither
went
the
mahratta
what
hast
thou
done
kim
had
been
trained
by
lurgan
sahib
by
virtue
of
his
business
was
no
bad
actor
in
place
of
the
tremulous
shrinking
trader
there
lolled
against
the
corner
an
all
but
naked
saddhu
his
swollen
eyes
opium
takes
quick
effect
on
an
empty
stomach
luminous
with
insolence
and
bestial
lust
his
legs
crossed
under
him
kim
brown
rosary
round
his
neck
and
a
scant
yard
of
worn
flowered
chintz
on
his
shoulders
the
child
buried
his
face
in
his
amazed
father
arms
up
princeling
we
travel
with
warlocks
but
they
will
not
hurt
thee
oh
do
not
cry
what
is
the
sense
of
curing
a
child
one
day
and
killing
him
with
fright
the
next
child
will
be
fortunate
all
his
life
he
has
seen
a
great
healing
when
i
was
a
child
i
made
clay
men
and
horses
have
made
them
too
sir
banas
he
comes
in
the
night
and
makes
them
all
alive
at
the
back
of
our
piped
the
child
so
thou
art
not
frightened
at
anything
eh
prince
was
frightened
because
my
father
was
frightened
i
felt
his
arms
shake
said
kim
and
even
the
abashed
jat
laughed
have
done
a
healing
on
this
poor
trader
he
must
forsake
his
gains
and
his
and
sit
by
the
wayside
three
nights
to
overcome
the
malignity
of
his
enemies
the
stars
are
against
him
fewer
the
better
say
i
but
saddhu
or
no
saddhu
he
should
pay
for
my
stuff
on
his
shoulders
but
that
is
thy
child
on
thy
shoulder
given
over
to
the
not
two
days
ago
there
remains
one
thing
more
i
did
this
charm
in
thy
presence
because
need
was
great
i
changed
his
shape
and
his
soul
none
the
less
if
by
any
chance
o
man
from
jullundur
thou
rememberest
what
thou
hast
seen
either
among
the
elders
sitting
under
the
village
tree
or
in
thine
own
house
or
in
company
of
thy
priest
when
he
blesses
thy
cattle
a
murrain
will
come
among
the
buffaloes
and
a
fire
in
thy
thatch
and
rats
in
the
and
the
curse
of
our
gods
upon
thy
fields
that
they
may
be
barren
before
thy
feet
and
after
thy
ploughshare
this
was
part
of
an
old
curse
picked
up
from
a
fakir
by
the
taksali
gate
in
the
days
of
kim
innocence
it
lost
nothing
by
repetition
holy
one
in
mercy
cease
cried
the
jat
not
curse
the
household
i
saw
nothing
i
heard
nothing
i
am
thy
cow
and
he
made
to
grab
at
kim
bare
foot
beating
rhythmically
on
the
carriage
floor
since
thou
hast
been
permitted
to
aid
me
in
the
matter
of
a
pinch
of
flour
and
a
little
opium
and
such
trifles
as
i
have
honoured
by
using
in
my
art
so
will
the
gods
return
a
blessing
and
he
gave
it
at
length
to
the
man
immense
relief
it
was
one
that
he
had
learned
from
lurgan
sahib
the
lama
stared
through
his
spectacles
as
he
had
not
stared
at
the
business
of
disguisement
of
the
stars
he
said
at
last
hast
acquired
great
wisdom
beware
that
it
do
not
give
birth
to
pride
no
man
having
the
law
before
his
eyes
speaks
hastily
of
any
matter
which
he
has
seen
or
encountered
no
no
indeed
cried
the
farmer
fearful
lest
the
master
should
be
minded
to
improve
on
the
pupil
with
relaxed
mouth
gave
himself
up
to
the
opium
that
is
meat
tobacco
and
medicine
to
the
spent
asiatic
so
in
a
silence
of
awe
and
great
miscomprehension
they
slid
into
delhi
about
time
chapter
who
hath
desired
the
sea
the
sight
of
unbounded
the
heave
and
the

and
the
hurl

saved
my

group
of
punjab
policemen
headed
by
a
hot
and
perspiring
young
englishman
parted
the
crowd
about
the
carriages
behind
them
inconspicuous
as
a
cat
ambled
a
small
fat
person
who
looked
like
a
lawyer
tout
the
young
sahib
reading
from
a
paper
my
description
is
in
his
hand
said
go
carriage
by
carriage
like
netting
a
pool
when
the
procession
reached
their
compartment
was
counting
his
beads
with
a
steady
jerk
of
the
wrist
while
kim
jeered
at
him
for
being
so
drugged
as
to
have
lost
the
ringed
which
are
the
saddhu
distinguishing
mark
the
lama
deep
in
meditation
stared
straight
before
him
and
the
farmer
glancing
furtively
gathered
up
his
belongings
here
but
a
parcel
of
said
the
englishman
aloud
and
passed
on
amid
a
ripple
of
uneasiness
for
native
police

extortion
to
the
native

over
trouble
now
whispered
in
sending
a
wire

place
where
i
hid
that
letter
i
was
sent
to
find
i
can
not
go
to

this
guise
it
not
enough
i
have
saved
thy
neck
if
the
work
be
left
unfinished
did
never
the
healer
of
sick
pearls
tell
thee
so
comes
another
sahib
ah
this
was
a
tallish
sallowish
district
superintendent
of
police
belt

polished
spurs
and
all
strutting
and
twirling
his
dark
moustache
fools
are
these
police
sahibs
said
kim
genially
glanced
up
under
his
eyelids
is
well
said
he
muttered
in
a
changed
voice
go
to
drink
water
keep
my
place
he
blundered
out
almost
into
the
englishman
arms
and
was
in
clumsy
urdu
mut
you
drunk
you
must
bang
about
as
though
delhi
station
belonged
to
you
my
friend
not
moving
a
muscle
of
his
countenance
answered
with
a
stream
of
the
filthiest
abuse
at
which
kim
naturally
rejoiced
it
reminded
him
of
the
and
the
at
umballa
in
the
terrible
time
of
his
first
schooling
good
fool
the
englishman
drawled
go
back
to
your
carriage
step
by
step
withdrawing
deferentially
and
dropping
his
voice
the
yellow
saddhu
clomb
back
to
the
carriage

by
an

of
gods
with
wholly
new

know
what
you
saying
the
englishman
flushed
angrily
it
some
piece
of
blasted
impertinence
come
out
of
that
affecting
to
misunderstand
gravely
produced
his
ticket
which
the
englishman
wrenched
angrily
from
his
hand
zoolum
what
oppression
growled
the
jat
from
his
corner
for
the
sake
of
a
jest
too
he
had
been
grinning
at
the
freedom
of
the
saddhu
tongue
charms
do
not
work
well
today
holy
one
the
saddhu
followed
the
policeman
fawning
and
supplicating
the
ruck
of
passengers
busy
with
their
babies
and
their
bundles
had
not
noticed
the
affair
kim
slipped
out
behind
him
for
it
flashed
through
his
head
that
he
had
heard
this
angry
stupid
sahib
discoursing
loud
personalities
to
an
old
lady
near
umballa
three
years
ago
is
well

in

calling

cageful
of
yelling
hawks
under

of
a
rajput
falconer
in
the
small
of
his
back
has
gone
now
to
send
word
of

i
hid

told
me
he

have
known
that
he

me
from
present
calamity
but
i
owe
my
life
to
thee
he
also
one
of
us
kim
ducked
under
a
mewar
greasy
armpit
and
cannoned
off
a
covey
of
jabbering
sikh
matrons
less
than
the
greatest
we
are
both
fortunate
i
will
make
report
to
him
of
what
thou
hast
done
i
am
safe
under
his
protection
he
bored
through
the
edge
of
the
crowd
besieging
the
carriages
and
squatted
by
the
bench
near
the
or
they
take
thy
place

no
fear
for
the
work
brother
or
my
life
thou
hast
given
me
and
strickland
sahib
has
pulled
me
to
land
we
may
work
together
at
the
game
yet
farewell
kim
hurried
to
his
carriage
elated
bewildered
but
a
little
nettled
in
that
he
had
no
key
to
the
secrets
about
him
am
only
a
beginner
at
the
game
that
is
sure
i
could
not
have
leaped
into
safety
as
did
the
saddhu
he
knew
it
was
darkest
under
the
lamp
i
could
not
have
thought
to
tell
news
under
pretence
of
cursing
and
how
clever
was
the
sahib
no
matter
i
saved
the
life
of
one
where
is
the
kamboh
gone
holy
one
he
whispered
as
he
took
his
seat
in
the
now
crowded
compartment
fear
gripped
him
the
lama
replied
with
a
touch
of
tender
malice
saw
thee
change
the
mahratta
to
a
saddhu
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
as
a
protection
against
evil
that
shook
him
then
he
saw
the
saddhu
fall
sheer
into
the
hands
of
the
polis
all
the
effect
of
thy
art
then
he
gathered
up
his
son
and
fled
for
he
said
that
thou
didst
change
a
quiet
trader
into
an
impudent
bandier
of
words
with
the
sahibs
and
he
feared
a
like
fate
where
is
the
saddhu
the
polis
said
kim
i
saved
the
kamboh
child
the
lama
snuffed
blandly
chela
see
how
thou
art
overtaken
thou
didst
cure
the
child
solely
to
acquire
merit
but
thou
didst
put
a
spell
on
the
mahratta
with
prideful
workings
i
watched
thee
and
with
sidelong
glances
to
bewilder
an
old
old
man
and
a
foolish
farmer
whence
calamity
and
suspicion
kim
controlled
himself
with
an
effort
beyond
his
years
not
more
than
any
other
youngster
did
he
like
to
eat
dirt
or
to
be
misjudged
but
he
saw
himself
in
a
cleft
stick
the
train
rolled
out
of
delhi
into
the
night
is
true
he
murmured
i
have
offended
thee
i
have
done
wrong
is
more
chela
thou
hast
loosed
an
act
upon
the
world
and
as
a
stone
thrown
into
a
pool
so
spread
the
consequences
thou
canst
not
tell
how
far
this
ignorance
was
well
both
for
kim
vanity
and
for
the
lama
peace
of
mind
when
we
think
that
there
was
then
being
handed
in
at
simla
a
reporting
the
arrival
of
at
delhi
and
more
important
the
whereabouts
of
a
letter
he
had
been
commissioned
to
abstract
incidentally
an
policeman
had
arrested
on
charge
of
murder
done
in
a
far
southern
state
a
horribly
indignant
ajmir
who
was
explaining
himself
to
a
mr
strickland
on
delhi
platform
while
was
paddling
through
byways
into
the
locked
heart
of
delhi
city
in
two
hours
several
telegrams
had
reached
the
angry
minister
of
a
southern
state
reporting
that
all
trace
of
a
somewhat
bruised
mahratta
had
been
lost
and
by
the
time
the
leisurely
train
halted
at
saharunpore
the
last
ripple
of
the
stone
kim
had
helped
to
heave
was
lapping
against
the
steps
of
a
mosque
in
roum
where
it
disturbed
a
pious
man
at
prayers
the
lama
made
his
in
ample
form
near
the
dewy
near
the
platform
cheered
by
the
clear
sunshine
and
the
presence
of
his
disciple
will
put
these
things
behind
us
he
said
indicating
the
brazen
engine
and
the
gleaming
track
jolting
of
the
though
a
wonderful
thing
has
turned
my
bones
to
water
we
will
use
clean
air
henceforward
us
go
to
the
kulu
woman
house
said
kim
and
stepped
forth
cheerily
under
the
bundles
early
morning
is
clean
and
well
scented
he
thought
of
the
other
mornings
at
st
xavier
and
it
topped
his
already
contentment
is
this
new
haste
born
from
wise
men
do
not
run
about
like
chickens
in
the
sun
we
have
come
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
koss
already
and
till
now
i
have
scarcely
been
alone
with
thee
an
instant
how
canst
thou
receive
instruction
all
jostled
of
crowds
how
can
i
whelmed
by
a
flux
of
talk
meditate
upon
the
way
tongue
grows
no
shorter
with
the
years
then
the
disciple
smiled
her
desire
for
charms
i
remember
once
when
i
spoke
of
the
wheel
of
life
the
lama
fumbled
in
his
bosom
for
his
latest
copy
was
only
curious
about
the
devils
that
besiege
children
she
shall
acquire
merit
by
entertaining
us
in
a
little
while
at
an
softly
softly
now
we
will
wander
waiting
upon
the
chain
of
things
the
search
is
sure
so
they
travelled
very
easily
across
and
among
the
broad
bloomful
by
way
of
aminabad
sahaigunge
akrola
of
the
ford
and
little
phulesa
the
line
of
the
siwaliks
always
to
the
north
and
behind
them
again
the
snows
after
long
sweet
sleep
under
the
dry
stars
came
the
lordly
leisurely
passage
through
a
waking
village
held
forth
in
silence
but
eyes
roving
in
defiance
of
the
law
from
sky
edge
to
sky
edge
then
would
kim
return
through
the
soft
dust
to
his
master
under
the
shadow
of
a
or
the
thinner
shade
of
a
white
doon
siris
to
eat
and
drink
at
ease
at
after
talk
and
a
little
wayfaring
they
slept
meeting
the
world
refreshed
when
the
air
was
cooler
night
found
them
adventuring
into
new
territory
some
chosen
village
spied
three
hours
before
across
the
fat
land
and
much
discussed
upon
the
road
there
they
told
their
tale
a
new
one
each
evening
so
far
as
kim
was
concerned
and
there
were
they
made
welcome
either
by
priest
or
headman
after
the
custom
of
the
kindly
east
when
the
shadows
shortened
and
the
lama
leaned
more
heavily
upon
kim
there
was
always
the
wheel
of
life
to
draw
forth
to
hold
flat
under
wiped
stones
and
with
a
long
straw
to
expound
cycle
by
cycle
here
sat
the
gods
on
high
and
they
were
dreams
of
dreams
here
was
our
heaven
and
the
world
of
the
horsemen
fighting
among
the
hills
here
were
the
agonies
done
upon
the
beasts
souls
ascending
or
descending
the
ladder
and
therefore
not
to
be
interfered
with
here
were
the
hells
hot
and
cold
and
the
abodes
of
tormented
ghosts
let
the
chela
study
the
troubles
that
come
from
bloated
stomach
and
burning
bowels
obediently
then
with
bowed
head
and
brown
finger
alert
to
follow
the
pointer
did
the
chela
study
but
when
they
came
to
the
human
world
busy
and
profitless
that
is
just
above
the
hells
his
mind
was
distracted
for
by
the
roadside
trundled
the
very
wheel
itself
eating
drinking
trading
marrying
and
quarrelling
all
warmly
alive
often
the
lama
made
the
living
pictures
the
matter
of
his
text
bidding
kim
too
ready
note
how
the
flesh
takes
a
thousand
shapes
desirable
or
detestable
as
men
reckon
but
in
truth
of
no
account
either
way
and
how
the
stupid
spirit
to
the
hog
the
dove
and
the
serpent
lusting
after
a
new
yoke
of
oxen
women
or
the
favour
of
kings
is
bound
to
follow
the
body
through
all
the
heavens
and
all
the
hells
and
strictly
round
again
sometimes
a
woman
or
a
poor
man
watching
the
ritual
it
was
nothing
less
when
the
great
yellow
chart
was
unfolded
would
throw
a
few
flowers
or
a
handful
of
cowries
upon
its
edge
it
sufficed
these
humble
ones
that
they
had
met
a
holy
one
who
might
be
moved
to
remember
them
in
his
prayers
them
if
they
are
sick
said
the
lama
when
kim
sporting
instincts
woke
them
if
they
have
fever
but
by
no
means
work
charms
remember
what
befell
the
mahratta
all
doing
is
evil
kim
replied
lying
out
under
a
big
tree
at
the
fork
of
the
doon
road
watching
the
little
ants
run
over
his
hand
abstain
from
action
is
well
except
to
acquire
merit
the
gates
of
learning
we
were
taught
that
to
abstain
from
action
was
unbefitting
a
sahib
and
i
am
a
sahib
of
all
the
world
the
lama
looked
directly
at
kim
am
an
old
man
pleased
with
shows
as
are
children
to
those
who
follow
the
way
there
is
neither
black
nor
white
hind
nor
bhotiyal
we
be
all
souls
seeking
escape
no
matter
what
thy
wisdom
learned
among
sahibs
when
we
come
to
my
river
thou
wilt
be
freed
from
all
illusion
at
my
side
hai
my
bones
ache
for
that
river
as
they
ached
in
the
but
my
spirit
sits
above
my
bones
waiting
the
search
is
sure
am
answered
is
it
permitted
to
ask
a
question
the
lama
inclined
his
stately
head
ate
thy
bread
for
three
years
as
thou
knowest
holy
one
whence
came
is
much
wealth
as
men
count
it
in
bhotiyal
the
lama
returned
with
composure
my
own
place
i
have
the
illusion
of
honour
i
ask
for
that
i
need
i
am
not
concerned
with
the
account
that
is
for
my
monastery
ai
the
black
high
seats
in
the
monastery
and
novices
all
in
order
and
he
told
stories
tracing
with
a
finger
in
the
dust
of
the
immense
and
sumptuous
ritual
of
cathedrals
of
processions
and
of
the
changing
of
monks
and
nuns
into
swine
of
holy
cities
fifteen
thousand
feet
in
the
air
of
intrigue
between
monastery
and
monastery
of
voices
among
the
hills
and
of
that
mysterious
mirage
that
dances
on
dry
snow
he
spoke
even
of
lhassa
and
of
the
dalai
lama
whom
he
had
seen
and
adored
each
long
perfect
day
rose
behind
kim
for
a
barrier
to
cut
him
off
from
his
race
and
his
he
slipped
back
to
thinking
and
dreaming
in
the
vernacular
and
mechanically
followed
the
ceremonial
observances
at
eating
drinking
and
the
like
the
old
man
mind
turned
more
and
more
to
his
monastery
as
his
eyes
turned
to
the
steadfast
snows
his
river
troubled
him
nothing
now
and
again
indeed
he
would
gaze
long
and
long
at
a
tuft
or
a
twig
expecting
he
said
the
earth
to
cleave
and
deliver
its
blessing
but
he
was
content
to
be
with
his
disciple
at
ease
in
the
temperate
wind
that
comes
down
from
the
doon
this
was
not
ceylon
nor
buddh
gaya
nor
bombay
nor
some
ruins
that
he
seemed
to
have
stumbled
upon
two
years
ago
he
spoke
of
those
places
as
a
scholar
removed
from
vanity
as
a
seeker
walking
in
humility
as
an
old
man
wise
and
temperate
illumining
knowledge
with
brilliant
insight
bit
by
bit
disconnectedly
each
tale
called
up
by
some
wayside
thing
he
spoke
of
all
his
wanderings
up
and
down
hind
till
kim
who
had
loved
him
without
reason
now
loved
him
for
fifty
good
reasons
so
they
enjoyed
themselves
in
high
felicity
abstaining
as
the
rule
demands
from
evil
words
covetous
desires
not
not
lying
on
high
beds
nor
wearing
rich
clothes
their
stomachs
told
them
the
time
and
the
people
brought
them
their
food
as
the
saying
is
they
were
lords
of
the
villages
of
aminabad
sahaigunge
akrola
of
the
ford
and
little
phulesa
where
kim
gave
the
soulless
woman
a
blessing
but
news
travels
fast
in
india
and
too
soon
shuffled
across
the
bearing
a
basket
of
fruits
with
a
box
of
kabul
grapes
and
gilt
oranges
a
servitor
a
lean
dry
oorya
begging
them
to
bring
the
honour
of
their
presence
to
his
mistress
distressed
in
her
mind
that
the
lama
had
neglected
her
so
long
do
i
remember
the
lama
spoke
as
though
it
were
a
wholly
new
proposition
is
virtuous
but
an
inordinate
talker
kim
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
cow
manger
telling
stories
to
a
village
smith
children
will
only
ask
for
another
son
for
her
daughter
i
have
not
forgotten
her
he
said
her
acquire
merit
send
word
that
we
will
come
they
covered
eleven
miles
through
the
fields
in
two
days
and
were
overwhelmed
with
attentions
at
the
end
for
the
old
lady
held
a
fine
tradition
of
hospitality
to
which
she
forced
her
who
was
under
the
thumb
of
his
and
bought
peace
by
borrowing
of
the
age
had
not
weakened
her
tongue
or
her
memory
and
from
a
discreetly
barred
upper
window
in
the
hearing
of
not
less
than
a
dozen
servants
she
paid
kim
compliments
that
would
have
flung
european
audiences
into
unclean
dismay
thou
art
still
the
shameless
of
the
parao
she
shrilled
have
not
forgotten
thee
wash
ye
and
eat
the
father
of
my
daughter
son
is
gone
away
awhile
so
we
poor
women
are
dumb
and
useless
for
proof
she
harangued
the
entire
household
unsparingly
till
food
and
drink
were
brought
and
in
the
evening
the
evening
and
turquoise
across
the
fields
it
pleased
her
to
order
her
palanquin
to
be
set
down
in
the
untidy
forecourt
by
smoky
torchlight
and
there
behind
not
too
closely
drawn
curtains
she
gossiped
the
holy
one
come
alone
i
should
have
received
him
otherwise
but
with
this
rogue
who
can
be
too
careful
said
kim
choosing
as
always
the
amplest
title
it
my
fault
that
none
other
than
a
sahib
a
called
the
maharanee
whose
face
he
that
was
on
the
pilgrimage
when
we
travel
thou
knowest
the
proverb
the
maharanee
a
breaker
of
hearts
and
a
dispenser
of
delights
remember
that
it
was
true
so
he
did
that
was
in
the
time
of
the
bloom
of
my
beauty
she
chuckled
like
a
contented
parrot
above
the
sugar
lump
tell
me
of
thy
goings
and
comings
as
much
as
may
be
without
shame
how
many
maids
and
whose
wives
hang
upon
thine
eyelashes
ye
hail
from
benares
i
would
have
gone
there
again
this
year
but
my
daughter
we
have
only
two
sons
phaii
such
is
the
effect
of
these
low
plains
now
in
kulu
men
are
elephants
but
i
would
ask
thy
holy
one
stand
aside
rogue
a
charm
against
most
lamentable
windy
colics
that
in
overtake
my
eldest
two
years
back
he
gave
me
a
powerful
spell
holy
one
said
kim
bubbling
with
mirth
at
the
lama
rueful
face
is
true
i
gave
her
one
against
wind
teeth
teeth
snapped
the
old
woman
them
if
they
are
sick
kim
quoted
relishingly
by
no
means
work
charms
remember
what
befell
the
mahratta
was
two
rains
ago
she
wearied
me
with
her
continual
importunity
the
lama
groaned
as
the
unjust
judge
had
groaned
before
him
it
comes
take
note
my
chela
that
even
those
who
would
follow
the
way
are
thrust
aside
by
idle
women
three
days
through
when
the
child
was
sick
she
talked
to
me
and
to
whom
else
should
i
talk
the
boy
mother
knew
nothing
and
the
father
in
the
nights
of
the
cold
weather
it
was
pray
to
the
gods
said
he
forsooth
and
turning
over
snored
gave
her
the
charm
what
is
an
old
man
to
do
abstain
from
action
is
well
except
to
acquire
merit
chela
if
thou
desertest
me
i
am
all
alone
found
his
easily
at
any
rate
said
the
old
lady
all
priests
are
alike
kim
coughed
severely
being
young
he
did
not
approve
of
her
flippancy
importune
the
wise
out
of
season
is
to
invite
calamity
is
a
talking
mynah
the
thrust
came
back
with
the
snap
of
the
jewelled
the
stables
which
has
picked
up
the
very
tone
of
the
family
priest
maybe
i
forget
honour
to
my
guests
but
if
ye
had
seen
him
double
his
fists
into
his
belly
which
was
like
a
gourd
and
cry
here
is
the
pain
ye
would
forgive
i
am
half
minded
to
take
the
hakim
medicine
he
sells
it
cheap
and
certainly
it
makes
him
fat
as
shiv
own
bull
he
does
not
deny
remedies
but
i
doubted
for
the
child
because
of
the
colour
of
the
bottles
the
lama
under
cover
of
the
monologue
had
faded
out
into
the
darkness
towards
the
room
prepared
hast
angered
him
belike
said
kim
he
he
is
wearied
and
i
forgot
being
a
grandmother
none
but
a
grandmother
should
ever
oversee
a
child
mothers
are
only
fit
for
bearing
tomorrow
when
he
sees
how
my
daughter
son
is
grown
he
will
write
the
charm
then
too
he
can
judge
of
the
new
drugs
is
the
hakim
maharanee
wanderer
as
thou
art
but
a
most
sober
bengali
from
dacca
a
master
of
medicine
he
relieved
me
of
an
oppression
after
meat
by
means
of
a
small
pill
that
wrought
like
a
devil
unchained
he
travels
about
now
vending
preparations
of
great
value
he
has
even
papers
printed
in
angrezi
telling
what
things
he
has
done
for
men
and
slack
women
he
has
been
here
four
days
but
hearing
ye
were
coming
hakims
and
priests
are
snake
and
tiger
the
world
over
he
has
as
i
take
it
gone
to
cover
while
she
drew
breath
after
this
volley
the
ancient
servant
sitting
unrebuked
on
the
edge
of
the
torchlight
muttered
house
is
a
as
it
were
for
all
charlatans
and
priests
let
the
boy
stop
eating
mangoes
but
who
can
argue
with
a
grandmother
he
raised
his
voice
respectfully
the
hakim
sleeps
after
his
meat
he
is
in
the
quarters
behind
the
dovecote
kim
bristled
like
an
expectant
terrier
to
outface
and
a
bengali
a
voluble
dacca
would
be
a
good
game
it
was
not
seemly
that
the
lama
and
incidentally
himself
should
be
thrown
aside
for
such
an
one
he
knew
those
curious
bastard
english
advertisements
at
the
backs
of
native
newspapers
st
boys
sometimes
brought
them
in
by
stealth
to
snigger
over
among
their
mates
for
the
language
of
the
grateful
patient
recounting
his
symptoms

most
simple
and
revealing
the
oorya
not
unanxious

off

parasite

the
other
slunk
away
towards
the
dovecote
said
kim
with
measured
scorn
is
a
little
coloured
water
and
a
very
great
shamelessness
their
prey
are
kings
and
overfed
bengalis
their
profit
is
in
children
who
are
not
born
the
old
lady
chuckled
not
be
envious
charms
are
better
eh
i
never
gainsaid
it
see
that
thy
holy
one
writes
me
a
good
amulet
by
the
morning
but
the
ignorant
deny
a
thick
heavy
voice
boomed
through
the
darkness
as
a

to
rest
squatting
but
the

the

of

so
sighed
the
old
lady
the
voice
launched
into
an
immense
tale
of
misfortune
and
bankruptcy
studded
with
plentiful
petitions
to
the
government
for
my
fate
which
overrules
all
i
had
been
now

alas
turning
into

mai
said
the
old
lady
praise
children
is
inauspicious
or
i
could
listen
to
this
talk
but
the
back
of
the
house
is
unguarded
and
even
in
this
soft
air
men
think
themselves
to
be
men

relaxed
as

when
he
meets

the
hakim
still
squatting
slid
over
his
hookah
with
a
friendly
foot
and
kim
pulled
at
the
good
weed
the
expected
grave
professional
debate
and
perhaps
a
little
free
doctoring
discuss
medicine
before
the

of

with
teaching
the

savagely
in

young
moonlight

for

and
he
drove
the
underlings
before

said
the
hakim
hardly
more
than
shaping
the
words
with
his
lips

you

jolly
glad
to

kim

clenched
about

not
have
been
astonished
but
here
in
this
quiet
backwater
of
life
he
was
not
prepared
for

babu
it
annoyed
him
too
that

been
hoodwinked

and
you
shall
not
know

how

he
chewed
leisurely
upon
a
few
cardamom
seeds
but
he
breathed
uneasily

is
the
question
as

it
can
be
a
deadly
pitfall
none
the
less
of
departmental
praise
ensnaring
praise
from
an
equal
of
work
appreciated
by
earth
has
nothing
on
the

plane
to

but
cried
the
oriental
in
him

babu
he
said
authoritatively

at

when

came
in
about

our
mutual
friend
said
he
had

would
take
this
piece
of
audacity
colonel

from

he
found
me
at
a
loose
string
and

much
railway

but
i
drew

i
meet
our

bally
bun
by
jove
it
was
splendid
i
come
to
tell

so
the
frogs

busy
in
the
ditches
and
the
moon
slid
to
her
setting
some
happy
servant
had
gone
out
to
commune
with
the
night
and
to
beat
upon
a
drum
kim

sentence
was
in
the
vernacular

miles
the
common
people
so

said
kim
looking
up
at
the
broad
grinning
face
am
a
sahib
dear
mister
i
hope
to
play
the
great
game
are
subordinate
to
me
departmentally
at
present
why
talk
like
an
ape
in
a
tree
men
do
not
come
after
one
from
simla
and
change
their
dress
for
the
sake
of
a
few
sweet
words
i
am
not
a
child
talk
hindi
and
let
us
get
to
the
yolk
of
the
egg
thou
art
here
speaking
not
one
word
of
truth
in
ten
why
art
thou
here
give
a
straight
answer
is
so
verree
disconcerting
of
the
europeans
mister
you
should
know
a
heap
better
at
your
time
of
life
i
want
to
know
said
kim
laughing
it
is
the
game
i
may
help
how
can
i
do
anything
if
you
bukh
babble
all
round
the
shop
hurree
babu
reached
for
the
pipe
and
sucked
it
till
it
gurgled
again
i
will
speak
vernacular
you
sit
tight
mister
it
concerns
the
pedigree
of
a
white
stallion
that
was
finished
long
ago
everyone
is
dead
the
great
game
is
finished
not
before
listen
to
me
till
the
end
there
were
five
kings
who
prepared
a
sudden
war
three
years
ago
when
thou
wast
given
the
stallion
pedigree
by
mahbub
ali
upon
them
because
of
that
news
and
ere
they
were
ready
fell
our
army
eight
thousand
men
with
guns
i
remember
that
night
the
war
was
not
pushed
that
is
the
government
custom
the
troops
were
recalled
because
the
government
believed
the
five
kings
were
cowed
and
it
is
not
cheap
to
feed
men
among
the
high
passes
hilas
and
bunar
rajahs
with
guns
undertook
for
a
price
to
guard
the
passes
against
all
coming
from
the
north
they
protested
both
fear
and
friendship
he
broke
off
with
a
giggle
into
english
course
i
tell
you
this
unoffeecially
to
elucidate
political
situation
mister
offeecially
i
am
debarred
from
criticizing
any
action
of
superiors
now
i
go
this
pleased
the
government
anxious
to
avoid
expense
and
a
bond
was
made
for
so
many
rupees
a
month
that
hilas
and
bunar
should
guard
the
passes
as
soon
as
the
state
troops
were
withdrawn
at
that
time
it
was
after
we
two
met
i
who
had
been
selling
tea
in
leh
became
a
clerk
of
accounts
in
the
army
when
the
troops
were
withdrawn
i
was
left
behind
to
pay
the
coolies
who
made
new
roads
in
the
hills
this
was
part
of
the
bond
between
bunar
hilas
and
the
government
and
then
tell
you
it
was
cold
up
there
too
after
summer
said
hurree
babu
confidentially
was
afraid
these
bunar
men
would
cut
my
throat
every
night
for
thee
my
native
they
laughed
at
me
by
jove
i
was
such
a
fearful
man
nevar
mind
thatt
i
go
on
colloquially
i
send
word
many
times
that
these
two
kings
were
sold
to
the
north
and
mahbub
ali
who
was
yet
farther
north
amply
confirmed
it
nothing
was
done
only
my
feet
were
frozen
and
a
toe
dropped
off
i
sent
word
that
the
roads
for
which
i
was
paying
money
to
the
diggers
were
being
made
for
the
feet
of
strangers
and
enemies
the
russians
the
thing
was
an
open
jest
among
the
coolies
then
i
was
called
down
to
tell
what
i
knew
by
speech
of
tongue
mahbub
came
south
too
see
the
end
over
the
passes
this
year
after
he
shivered
afresh
two
strangers
under
cover
of
shooting
wild
goats
they
bear
guns
but
they
bear
also
chains
and
levels
and
compasses
the
thing
gets
clearer
are
well
received
by
hilas
and
bunar
they
make
great
promises
they
speak
as
the
mouthpiece
of
a
kaisar
with
gifts
up
the
valleys
down
the
valleys
go
they
saying
here
is
a
place
to
build
a
breastwork
here
can
ye
pitch
a
fort
here
can
ye
hold
the
road
against
an
army
the
very
roads
for
which
i
paid
out
the
rupees
monthly
the
government
knows
but
does
nothing
the
three
other
kings
who
were
not
paid
for
guarding
the
passes
tell
them
by
runner
of
the
bad
faith
of
bunar
and
hilas
when
all
the
evil
is
done
look
you
when
these
two
strangers
with
the
levels
and
the
compasses
make
the
five
kings
to
believe
that
a
great
army
will
sweep
the
passes
tomorrow
or
the
next
day
are
all
fools
comes
the
order
to
me
hurree
babu
go
north
and
see
what
those
strangers
do
i
say
to
creighton
sahib
this
is
not
a
lawsuit
that
we
go
about
to
collect
evidence
hurree
returned
to
his
english
with
a
jerk
jove
i
said
why
the
dooce
do
you
not
issue
orders
to
some
brave
man
to
poison
them
for
an
example
it
is
if
you
permit
the
observation
most
reprehensible
laxity
on
your
part
and
colonel
creighton
he
laughed
at
me
it
is
all
your
beastly
english
pride
you
think
no
one
dare
conspire
that
is
all
kim
smoked
slowly
revolving
the
business
so
far
as
he
understood
it
in
his
quick
mind
thou
goest
forth
to
follow
the
strangers
to
meet
them
they
are
coming
in
to
simla
to
send
down
their
horns
and
heads
to
be
dressed
at
calcutta
they
are
exclusively
sporting
gentlemen
and
they
are
allowed
special
faceelities
by
the
government
of
course
we
always
do
that
it
is
our
british
pride
what
is
to
fear
from
them
jove
they
are
not
black
people
i
can
do
all
sorts
of
things
with
black
people
of
course
they
are
russians
and
highly
unscrupulous
people
i
i
do
not
want
to
consort
with
them
without
a
witness
they
kill
thee
thatt
is
nothing
i
am
good
enough
herbert
spencerian
i
trust
to
meet
little
thing
like
death
which
is
all
in
my
fate
you
know
but
but
they
may
beat
me
hurree
babu
snapped
his
fingers
with
irritation
course
i
shall
affeeliate
myself
to
their
camp
in
supernumerary
capacity
as
perhaps
interpreter
or
person
mentally
impotent
and
hungree
or
some
such
thing
and
then
i
must
pick
up
what
i
can
i
suppose
that
is
as
easy
for
me
as
playing
mister
doctor
to
the
old
lady
onlee
onlee
you
see
mister
i
am
unfortunately
asiatic
which
is
serious
detriment
in
some
respects
and
i
am
bengali
a
fearful
man
made
the
hare
and
the
bengali
what
shame
said
kim
quoting
the
proverb
was
process
of
evolution
i
think
from
primal
necessity
but
the
fact
remains
in
all
the
cui
bono
i
am
oh
awfully
fearful
i
remember
once
they
wanted
to
cut
off
my
head
on
the
road
to
lhassa
no
i
have
never
reached
to
lhassa
i
sat
down
and
cried
mister
anticipating
chinese
tortures
i
do
not
suppose
these
two
gentlemen
will
torture
me
but
i
like
to
provide
for
possible
contingency
with
european
assistance
in
emergency
he
coughed
and
spat
out
the
cardamoms
is
purely
unoffeecial
indent
to
which
you
can
say
no
babu
if
you
have
no
pressing
engagement
with
your
old
man
perhaps
you
might
divert
him
perhaps
i
can
seduce
his
fancies
i
should
like
you
to
keep
in
departmental
touch
with
me
till
i
find
those
sporting
coves
i
have
great
opeenion
of
you
since
i
met
my
friend
at
delhi
and
also
i
will
embody
your
name
in
my
offeecial
report
when
matter
is
finally
adjudicated
it
will
be
a
great
feather
in
your
cap
that
is
why
i
come
really
the
end
of
the
tale
i
think
is
true
but
what
of
the
the
five
kings
oah
there
is
ever
so
much
truth
in
it
a
lots
more
than
you
would
suppose

hurree
earnestly

rampur
into
chini
that

the
only
way

certainly
rejoice
to
see

hills
again
said
kim
meditatively
his
speech
these
ten
days
past
has
been
of
little
else
if
we
go
together
we
can
be
quite
strangers
on
the
road
if
your
lama
prefers
i
shall
just
be
four
or
five
miles
ahead
there
is
no
hurry
for
hurree
that
is
an
europe
pun
ha
ha
and
you
come
after
there
is
plenty
of
time
they
will
plot
and
survey
and
map
of
course
i
shall
go
tomorrow
and
you
the
next
day
if
you
choose
eh
you
go
think
on
it
till
morning
by
jove
it
is
near
morning
now
he
yawned
ponderously
and
with
never
a
civil
word
lumbered
off
to
his
but
kim
slept
little
and
his
thoughts
ran
in
hindustani
is
the
game
called
great
i
was
four
days
a
scullion
at
quetta
waiting
on
the
wife
of
the
man
whose
book
i
stole
and
that
was
part
of
the
great
game
from
the
south
god
knows
how
far
came
up
the
mahratta
playing
the
great
game
in
fear
of
his
life
now
i
shall
go
far
and
far
into
the
north
playing
the
great
game
truly
it
runs
like
a
shuttle
throughout
all
hind
and
my
share
and
my
joy
he
smiled
to
the
darkness
owe
to
the
lama
here
also
to
mahbub
ali
also
to
creighton
sahib
but
chiefly
to
the
holy
one
he
is
right
a
great
and
a
wonderful
world
and
i
am
kim
kim
kim
alone
one
person
in
the
middle
of
it
all
but
i
will
see
these
strangers
with
their
levels
and
chains
was
the
upshot
of
last
night
babble
said
the
lama
after
his
orisons
came
a
strolling
seller
of
drugs
a
of
the
sahiba
him
i
abolished
by
arguments
and
prayers
proving
that
our
charms
are
worthier
than
his
coloured
waters
my
charms
is
the
virtuous
woman
still
bent
upon
a
new
one
strictly
it
must
be
written
or
she
will
deafen
me
with
her
clamour
he
fumbled
at
his
pencase
the
plains
said
kim
always
too
many
people
in
the
hills
as
i
understand
there
are
fewer
the
hills
and
the
snows
upon
the
hills
the
lami
tore
off
a
tiny
square
of
paper
fit
to
go
in
an
amulet
what
dost
thou
know
of
the
hills
are
very
close
kim
thrust
open
the
door
and
looked
at
the
long
peaceful
line
of
the
himalayas
flushed
in
in
the
dress
of
a
sahib
i
have
never
set
foot
among
them
the
lama
snuffed
the
wind
wistfully
we
go
north
kim
put
the
question
to
the
waking
sunrise
not
much
heat
be
avoided
by
walking
among
the
lower
hills
at
least
is
the
charm
made
holy
one
have
written
the
names
of
seven
silly
devils
not
one
of
whom
is
worth
a
grain
of
dust
in
the
eye
thus
do
foolish
women
drag
us
from
the
way
hurree
babu
came
out
from
behind
the
dovecote
washing
his
teeth
with
ostentatious
ritual
and
he
did
not
look
like
fearful
man
kim
signed
almost
imperceptibly
that
matters
were
in
good
train
and
when
the
morning
toilet
was
over
hurree
babu
in
flowery
speech
came
to
do
honour
to
the
lama
they
ate
of
course
apart
and
afterwards
the
old
lady
more
or
less
veiled
behind
a
window
returned
to
the
vital
business
of
colics
in
the
young
the
lama
knowledge
of
medicine
was
of
course
sympathetic
only
he
believed
that
the
dung
of
a
black
horse
mixed
with
sulphur
and
carried
in
a
was
a
sound
remedy
for
cholera
but
the
symbolism
interested
him
far
more
than
the
science
hurree
babu
deferred
to
these
views
with
enchanting
politeness
so
that
the
lama
called
him
a
courteous
physician
hurree
babu
replied
that
he
was
no
more
than
an
inexpert
dabbler
in
the
mysteries
but
at
least
he
thanked
the
gods
therefore
he
knew
when
he
sat
in
the
presence
of
a
master
he
himself
had
been
taught
by
the
sahibs
who
do
not
consider
expense
in
the
lordly
halls
of
calcutta
but
as
he
was
ever
first
to
acknowledge
there
lay
a
wisdom
behind
earthly
wisdom
the
high
and
lonely
lore
of
meditation
kim
looked
on
with
envy
the
hurree
babu
of
his
knowledge
oily
effusive
and
nervous
was
gone
gone
too
was
the
brazen
of
overnight
there
remained
polished
polite
attentive
a
sober
learned
son
of
experience
and
adversity
gathering
wisdom
from
the
lama
lips
the
old
lady
confided
to
kim
that
these
rare
levels
were
beyond
her
she
liked
charms
with
plenty
of
ink
that
one
could
wash
off
in
water
swallow
and
be
done
with
else
what
was
the
use
of
the
gods
she
liked
men
and
women
and
she
spoke
of
them
of
kinglets
she
had
known
in
the
past
of
her
own
youth
and
beauty
of
the
depredations
of
leopards
and
the
eccentricities
of
love
asiatic
of
the
incidence
of
taxation
funeral
ceremonies
her
this
by
allusion
easy
to
be
followed
the
care
of
the
young
and
the
lack
of
decency
and
kim
as
interested
in
the
life
of
this
world
as
she
soon
to
leave
it
squatted
with
his
feet
under
the
hem
of
his
robe
drinking
all
in
while
the
lama
demolished
one
after
another
every
theory
of
put
forward
by
hurree
babu
at
noon
the
babu
strapped
up
his
took
his
shoes
of
ceremony
in
one
hand
a
gay
umbrella
in
the
other
and
set
off
northwards
to
the
doon
where
he
said
he
was
in
demand
among
the
lesser
kings
of
those
parts
will
go
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
chela
said
the
lama
doctor
learned
in
physic
and
courtesy
affirms
that
the
people
among
these
lower
hills
are
devout
generous
and
much
in
need
of
a
teacher
in
a
very
short
time
so
says
the
hakim
we
come
to
cool
air
and
the
smell
of
pines
go
to
the
hills
and
by
kulu
road
oh
thrice
happy
shrilled
the
old
lady
that
i
am
a
little
pressed
with
the
care
of
the
homestead
i
would
take
palanquin
but
that
would
be
shameless
and
my
reputation
would
be
cracked
ho
ho
i
know
the
road
every
march
of
the
road
i
know
ye
will
find
charity
throughout
it
is
not
denied
to
the
i
will
give
orders
for
provision
a
servant
to
set
you
forth
upon
your
journey
no
then
i
will
at
least
cook
ye
good
food
a
woman
is
the
sahiba
said
the
oorya
when
a
tumult
rose
by
the
kitchen
quarters
has
never
forgotten
a
friend
she
has
never
forgotten
an
enemy
in
all
her
years
and
her
cookery
wah
he
rubbed
his
slim
stomach
there
were
cakes
there
were
sweetmeats
there
was
cold
fowl
stewed
to
rags
with
rice
and
prunes
enough
to
burden
kim
like
a
mule
am
old
and
useless
she
said
now
love
me
and
none
respect
but
there
are
few
to
compare
with
me
when
i
call
on
the
gods
and
squat
to
my
come
again
o
people
of
good
will
holy
one
and
disciple
come
again
the
room
is
always
prepared
the
welcome
is
always
ready
see
the
women
do
not
follow
thy
chela
too
openly
i
know
the
women
of
kulu
take
heed
chela
lest
he
run
away
when
he
smells
his
hills
again
hai
do
not
tilt
the
upside
down
bless
the
household
holy
one
and
forgive
thy
servant
her
stupidities
she
wiped
her
red
old
eyes
on
a
corner
of
her
veil
and
clucked
throatily
talk
said
the
lama
at
last
that
is
a
woman
infirmity
i
gave
her
a
charm
she
is
upon
the
wheel
and
wholly
given
over
to
the
shows
of
this
life
but
none
the
less
chela
she
is
virtuous
kindly
hospitable
of
a
whole
and
zealous
heart
who
shall
say
she
does
not
acquire
merit
i
holy
one
said
kim
reslinging
the
bountiful
provision
on
his
shoulders
my
mind
behind
my
eyes
i
have
tried
to
picture
such
an
one
altogether
freed
from
the
wheel
desiring
nothing
causing
nothing
a
nun
as
it
were
o
imp
the
lama
almost
laughed
aloud
can
not
make
the
picture
i
but
there
are
many
many
millions
of
lives
before
her
she
will
get
wisdom
a
little
it
may
be
in
each
one
will
she
forget
how
to
make
stews
with
saffron
upon
that
road
mind
is
set
on
things
unworthy
but
she
has
skill
i
am
refreshed
all
over
when
we
reach
the
lower
hills
i
shall
be
yet
stronger
the
hakim
spoke
truly
to
me
this
morn
when
he
said
a
breath
from
the
snows
blows
away
twenty
years
from
the
life
of
a
man
we
will
go
up
into
the
hills
the
high
hills
up
to
the
sound
of
and
the
sound
of
the
trees
for
a
little
while
the
hakim
said
that
at
any
time
we
may
return
to
the
plains
for
we
do
no
more
than
skirt
the
pleasant
places
the
hakim
is
full
of
learning
but
he
is
in
no
way
proud
i
spoke
to
him
when
thou
wast
talking
to
the
sahiba
of
a
certain
dizziness
that
lays
hold
upon
the
back
of
my
neck
in
the
night
and
he
said
it
rose
from
excessive
heat
to
be
cured
by
cool
air
upon
consideration
i
marvelled
that
i
had
not
thought
of
such
a
simple
remedy
thou
tell
him
of
thy
search
said
kim
a
little
jealously
he
preferred
to
sway
the
lama
by
his
own
speech
not
through
the
wiles
of
hurree
babu
i
told
him
of
my
dream
and
of
the
manner
by
which
i
had
acquired
merit
by
causing
thee
to
be
taught
wisdom
didst
not
say
i
was
a
sahib
need
i
have
told
thee
many
times
we
be
but
two
souls
seeking
escape
he
said
and
he
is
just
herein
that
the
river
of
healing
will
break
forth
even
as
i
dreamed
at
my
feet
if
need
be
having
found
the
way
seest
thou
that
shall
free
me
from
the
wheel
need
i
trouble
to
find
a
way
about
the
mere
fields
of
earth
which
are
illusion
that
were
senseless
i
have
my
dreams
night
upon
night
repeated
i
have
jataka
and
i
have
thee
friend
of
all
the
world
it
was
written
in
thy
horoscope
that
a
red
bull
on
a
green
field
i
have
not
forgotten
should
bring
thee
to
honour
who
but
i
saw
that
prophecy
accomplished
indeed
i
was
the
instrument
thou
shalt
find
me
my
river
being
in
return
the
instrument
the
search
is
sure
he
set
his
face
serene
and
untroubled
towards
the
beckoning
hills
his
shadow
shouldering
far
before
him
in
the
dust
chapter
who
hath
desired
the
sea
the
immense
and
contemptuous
surges
the
shudder
the
stumble
the
swerve
ere
the
bowsprit
merges
the
orderly
clouds
of
the
trades
and
the
ridged
roaring
sapphire
thereunder
unheralded
flaws
and
the
thunder
his
sea
in
no
wonder
the
same
his
sea
and
the
same
in
each
wonder
his
sea
that
his
being
fulfils
so
and
no
otherwise
so
and
no
otherwise

their
hills
the

and
the
hills
goes
to
the
hills
goes
to
his
mother
they
had
crossed
the
siwaliks
and
the
doon
left
mussoorie
behind
them
and
headed
north
along
the
narrow
day
after
day
they
struck
deeper
into
the
huddled
mountains
and
day
after
day
kim
watched
the
lama
return
to
a
man
strength
among
the
terraces
of
the
doon
he
had
leaned
on
the
boy
shoulder
ready
to
profit
by
wayside
halts
under
the
great
ramp
to
mussoorie
he
drew
himself
together
as
an
old
hunter
faces
a
bank
and
where
he
should
have
sunk
exhausted
swung
his
long
draperies
about
him
drew
a
deep
of
the
diamond
air
and
walked
as
only
a
hillman
can
kim
and
sweated
and
panted
astonished
is
my
country
said
the
lama
this
is
flatter
than
a
and
with
steady
driving
strokes
from
the
loins
he
strode
upwards
but
it
was
on
the
steep
downhill
marches
three
thousand
feet
in
three
hours
that
he
went
utterly
away
from
kim
whose
back
ached
with
holding
back
and
whose
big
toe
was
nigh
cut
off
by
his
grass
through
the
speckled
shadow
of
the
great
through
oak
feathered
and
plumed
with
ferns
birch
ilex
rhododendron
and
pine
out
on
to
the
bare
hillsides
slippery
sunburnt
grass
and
back
into
the
woodlands
coolth
again
till
oak
gave
way
to
bamboo
and
palm
of
the
valley
the
lama
swung
untiring
glancing
back
in
the
twilight
at
the
huge
ridges
behind
him
and
the
faint
thin
line
of
the
road
whereby
they
had
come
he
would
lay
out
with
a
hillman
generous
breadth
of
vision
fresh
marches
for
the
morrow
or
halting
in
the
neck
of
some
uplifted
pass
that
gave
on
spiti
and
kulu
would
stretch
out
his
hands
yearningly
towards
the
high
snows
of
the
horizon
in
the
dawns
they
flared
above
stark
blue
as
kedarnath
and
badrinath
kings
of
that
wilderness
took
the
first
sunlight
all
day
long
they
lay
like
molten
silver
under
the
sun
and
at
evening
put
on
their
jewels
again
at
first
they
breathed
temperately
upon
the
travellers
winds
good
to
meet
when
one
crawled
over
some
gigantic
but
in
a
few
days
at
a
height
of
nine
or
ten
thousand
feet
those
breezes
bit
and
kim
kindly
allowed
a
village
of
hillmen
to
acquire
merit
by
giving
him
a
rough
the
lama
was
mildly
surprised
that
anyone
should
object
to
the
breezes
which
had
cut
the
years
off
his
shoulders
are
but
the
lower
hills
chela
there
is
no
cold
till
we
come
to
the
true
hills
and
water
are
good
and
the
people
are
devout
enough
but
the
food
is
very
bad
kim
growled
we
walk
as
though
we
were
mad
or
english
it
freezes
at
night
too
little
maybe
but
only
enough
to
make
old
bones
rejoice
in
the
sun
we
must
not
always
delight
in
soft
beds
and
rich
food
might
at
least
keep
to
the
road
kim
had
all
a
plainsman
affection
for
the
track
not
six
feet
wide
that
snaked
among
the
mountains
but
the
lama
being
tibetan
could
not
refrain
from
short
cuts
over
spurs
and
the
rims
of
slopes
as
he
explained
to
his
limping
disciple
a
man
bred
among
mountains
can
prophesy
the
course
of
a
and
though
clouds
might
be
a
hindrance
to
a
stranger
they
made
no
earthly
difference
to
a
thoughtful
man
thus
after
long
hours
of
what
would
be
reckoned
very
fair
mountaineering
in
civilized
countries
they
would
pant
over
a
sidle
past
a
few
landslips
and
drop
through
forest
at
an
angle
of
onto
the
road
again
along
their
track
lay
the
villages
of
the
hillfolk
mud
and
earth
huts
timbers
now
and
then
rudely
carved
with
an
axe
clinging
like
swallows
nests
against
the
steeps
huddled
on
tiny
flats
down
a
glissade
jammed
into
a
corner
between
cliffs
that
funnelled
and
focused
every
wandering
blast
or
for
the
sake
of
summer
pasture
cowering
down
on
a
neck
that
in
winter
would
be
ten
feet
deep
in
snow
and
the
people
the
sallow
greasy
people
with
short
bare
legs
and
faces
almost
esquimaux
would
flock
out
and
adore
the
plains
kindly
and
gentle
had
treated
the
lama
as
a
holy
man
among
holy
men
but
the
hills
worshipped
him
as
one
in
the
confidence
of
all
their
devils
theirs
was
an
almost
obliterated
buddhism
overlaid
with
a
fantastic
as
their
own
landscapes
elaborate
as
the
terracing
of
their
tiny
fields
but
they
recognized
the
big
hat
the
clicking
rosary
and
the
rare
chinese
texts
for
great
authority
and
they
respected
the
man
beneath
the
hat
saw
thee
come
down
over
the
black
breasts
of
eua
said
a
betah
who
gave
them
cheese
sour
milk
and
bread
one
evening
do
not
use
that
often
except
when
calving
cows
stray
in
summer
there
is
a
sudden
wind
among
those
stones
that
casts
men
down
on
the
stillest
day
but
what
should
such
folk
care
for
the
devil
of
eua
then
did
kim
aching
in
every
fibre
dizzy
with
looking
down
footsore
with
cramping
desperate
toes
into
inadequate
crannies
take
joy
in
the
day
march
such
joy
as
a
boy
of
st
xavier
who
had
won
the
on
the
flat
might
take
in
the
praises
of
his
friends
the
hills
sweated
the
ghi
and
sugar
suet
off
his
bones
the
dry
air
taken
sobbingly
at
the
head
of
cruel
passes
firmed
and
built
out
his
upper
ribs
and
the
tilted
levels
put
new
hard
muscles
into
calf
and
thigh
they
meditated
often
on
the
wheel
of
life
the
more
so
since
as
the
lama
said
they
were
freed
from
its
visible
temptations
except
the
grey
eagle
and
an
occasional
bear
grubbing
and
rooting
on
the
hillside
a
vision
of
a
furious
painted
leopard
met
at
dawn
in
a
still
valley
devouring
a
goat
and
now
and
again
a
bird
they
were
alone
with
the
winds
and
the
grass
singing
under
the
wind
the
women
of
the
smoky
huts
over
whose
roofs
the
two
walked
as
they
descended
the
mountains
were
unlovely
and
unclean
wives
of
many
husbands
and
afflicted
with
goitre
the
men
were
woodcutters
when
they
were
not
farmers
meek
and
of
an
incredible
simplicity
but
that
suitable
discourse
might
not
fail
fate
sent
them
overtaking
and
overtaken
upon
the
road
the
courteous
dacca
physician
who
paid
for
his
food
in
ointments
good
for
goitre
and
counsels
that
restore
peace
between
men
and
women
he
seemed
to
know
these
hills
as
well
as
he
knew
the
hill
dialects
and
gave
the
lama
the
lie
of
the
land
towards
ladakh
and
tibet
he
said
they
could
return
to
the
plains
at
any
moment
meantime
for
such
as
loved
mountains
yonder
road
might
amuse
this
was
not
all
revealed
in
a
breath
but
at
evening
encounters
on
the
stone
when
patients
disposed
of
the
doctor
would
smoke
and
the
lama
snuff
while
kim
watched
the
wee
cows
grazing
on
the
housetops
or
threw
his
soul
after
his
eyes
across
the
deep
blue
gulfs
between
range
and
range
and
there
were
talks
apart
in
the
dark
woods
when
the
doctor
would
seek
herbs
and
kim
as
budding
physician
must
accompany
him
see
mister
i
do
not
know
what
the
all
i
shall
do
when
i
find
our
sporting
friends
but
if
you
will
kindly
keep
within
sight
of
my
umbrella
which
is
fine
fixed
point
for
cadastral
survey
i
shall
feel
much
better
kim
looked
out
across
the
jungle
of
peaks
is
not
my
country
hakim
easier
i
think
to
find
one
louse
in
a
thatt
is
my
strong
points
there
is
no
hurry
for
hurree
they
were
at
leh
not
so
long
ago
they
said
they
had
come
down
from
the
karakorum
with
their
heads
and
horns
and
all
i
am
onlee
afraid
they
will
have
sent
back
all
their
letters
and
compromising
things
from
leh
into
russian
territoree
of
course
they
will
walk
away
as
far
to
the
east
as
possible
just
to
show
that
they
were
never
among
the
western
states
you
do
not
know
the
hills
he
scratched
with
a
twig
on
the
earth
they
should
have
come
in
by
srinagar
or
abbottabad
thatt
is
their
short
road
down
the
river
by
bunji
and
astor
but
they
have
made
mischief
in
the
west
so
he
drew
a
furrow
from
left
to
right
march
and
they
march
away
east
to
leh
ah
it
is
cold
there
and
down
the
indus
to
hanle
i
know
that
road
and
then
down
you
see
to
bushahr
and
chini
valley
that
is
ascertained
by
process
of
elimination
and
also
by
asking
questions
from
people
that
i
cure
so
well
our
friends
have
been
a
long
time
playing
about
and
producing
impressions
so
they
are
well
known
from
far
off
you
will
see
me
catch
them
somewhere
in
chini
valley
please
keep
your
eye
on
the
umbrella
it
nodded
like
a
harebell
down
the
valleys
and
round
the
mountain
sides
and
in
due
time
the
lama
and
kim
who
steered
by
compass
would
overhaul
it
vending
ointments
and
powders
at
eventide
came
by
such
and
such
a
way
the
lama
would
throw
a
careless
finger
backward
at
the
ridges
and
the
umbrella
would
expend
itself
in
compliments
they
crossed
a
snowy
pass
in
cold
moonlight
when
the
lama
mildly
chaffing
kim
went
through
up
to
his
knees
like
a
bactrian
camel
the
sort
that
came
into
the
kashmir
serai
they
dipped
across
beds
of
light
snow
and
shale
where
they
took
refuge
from
a
gale
in
a
camp
of
tibetans
hurrying
down
tiny
sheep
each
laden
with
a
bag
of
borax
they
came
out
upon
grassy
shoulders
still
and
through
forest
to
grass
anew
for
all
their
marchings
kedarnath
and
badrinath
were
not
impressed
and
it
was
only
after
days
of
travel
that
kim
uplifted
upon
some
insignificant
hummock
could
see
that
a
or
horn
of
the
two
great
lords
had
ever
so
slightly
changed
outline
at
last
they
entered
a
world
within
a
world
a
valley
of
leagues
where
the
high
hills
were
fashioned
of
a
mere
rubble
and
refuse
from
off
the
knees
of
the
mountains
here
one
day
march
carried
them
no
farther
it
seemed
than
a
dreamer
clogged
pace
bears
him
in
a
nightmare
they
skirted
a
shoulder
painfully
for
hours
and
behold
it
was
but
an
outlying
boss
in
an
outlying
buttress
of
the
main
pile
a
rounded
meadow
revealed
itself
when
they
had
reached
it
for
a
vast
tableland
running
far
into
the
valley
three
days
later
it
was
a
dim
fold
in
the
earth
to
southward
the
gods
live
here
said
kim
beaten
down
by
the
silence
and
the
appalling
sweep
and
dispersal
of
the
after
rain
is
no
place
for
men
and
long
ago
said
the
lama
as
to
himself
was
asked
of
the
lord
whether
the
world
were
everlasting
on
this
the
excellent
one
returned
no
answer
when
i
was
in
ceylon
a
wise
seeker
confirmed
that
from
the
gospel
which
is
written
in
pali
certainly
since
we
know
the
way
to
freedom
the
question
were
unprofitable
but
look
and
know
illusion
chela
these
are
the
true
hills
they
are
like
my
hills
by
suchzen
never
were
such
hills
above
them
still
enormously
above
them
earth
towered
away
towards
the
where
from
east
to
west
across
hundreds
of
miles
ruled
as
with
a
ruler
the
last
of
the
bold
birches
stopped
above
that
in
scarps
and
blocks
upheaved
the
rocks
strove
to
fight
their
heads
above
the
white
smother
above
these
again
changeless
since
the
beginning
but
changing
to
every
mood
of
sun
and
cloud
lay
out
the
eternal
snow
they
could
see
blots
and
blurs
on
its
face
where
storm
and
wandering
got
up
to
dance
below
them
as
they
stood
the
forest
slid
away
in
a
sheet
of
for
mile
upon
mile
below
the
forest
was
a
village
in
its
sprinkle
of
terraced
fields
and
steep
below
the
village
they
knew
though
a
thunderstorm
worried
and
growled
there
for
the
moment
a
pitch
of
twelve
or
fifteen
hundred
feet
gave
to
the
moist
valley
where
the
streams
gather
that
are
the
mothers
of
young
sutluj
as
usual
the
lama
had
led
kim
by
and
far
from
the
main
route
along
which
hurree
babu
that
man
had
bucketed
three
days
before
through
a
storm
to
which
nine
englishmen
out
of
ten
would
have
given
full
right
of
way
hurree
was
no
the
snick
of
a
trigger
made
him
change
colour
but
as
he
himself
would
have
said
he
was
effeecient
stalker
and
he
had
raked
the
huge
valley
with
a
pair
of
cheap
binoculars
to
some
purpose
moreover
the
white
of
worn
canvas
tents
against
green
carries
far
hurree
babu
had
seen
all
he
wanted
to
see
when
he
sat
on
the
of
ziglaur
twenty
miles
away
as
the
eagle
flies
and
forty
by
road
that
is
to
say
two
small
dots
which
one
day
were
just
below
the
and
the
next
had
moved
downward
perhaps
six
inches
on
the
hillside
once
cleaned
out
and
set
to
the
work
his
fat
bare
legs
could
cover
a
surprising
amount
of
ground
and
this
was
the
reason
why
while
kim
and
the
lama
lay
in
a
leaky
hut
at
ziglaur
till
the
storm
should
be
an
oily
wet
but
always
smiling
bengali
talking
the
best
of
english
with
the
vilest
of
phrases
was
ingratiating
himself
with
two
sodden
and
rather
rheumatic
foreigners
he
had
arrived
revolving
many
wild
schemes
on
the
heels
of
a
thunderstorm
which
had
split
a
pine
over
against
their
camp
and
so
convinced
a
dozen
or
two
forcibly
impressed
the
day
was
inauspicious
for
farther
travel
that
with
one
accord
they
had
thrown
down
their
loads
and
jibbed
they
were
subjects
of
a
hill
rajah
who
farmed
out
their
services
as
is
the
custom
for
his
private
gain
and
to
add
to
their
personal
distresses
the
strange
sahibs
had
already
threatened
them
with
rifles
the
most
of
them
knew
rifles
and
sahibs
of
old
they
were
trackers
and
shikarris
of
the
northern
valleys
keen
after
bear
and
wild
goat
but
they
had
never
been
thus
treated
in
their
lives
so
the
forest
took
them
to
her
bosom
and
for
all
oaths
and
clamour
refused
to
restore
there
was
no
need
to
feign
madness
or
the
babu
had
thought
of
another
means
of
securing
a
welcome
he
wrung
out
his
wet
clothes
slipped
on
his
shoes
opened
the
umbrella
and
with
mincing
gait
and
a
heart
beating
against
his
tonsils
appeared
as
for
his
royal
highness
the
rajah
of
rampur
gentlemen
what
can
i
do
for
you
please
the
gentlemen
were
delighted
one
was
visibly
french
the
other
russian
but
they
spoke
english
not
much
inferior
to
the
babu
they
begged
his
kind
offices
their
native
servants
had
gone
sick
at
leh
they
had
hurried
on
because
they
were
anxious
to
bring
the
spoils
of
the
chase
to
simla
ere
the
skins
grew
they
bore
a
general
letter
of
introduction
the
babu
salaamed
to
it
orientally
to
all
government
officials
no
they
had
not
met
any
other
en
route
they
did
for
themselves
they
had
plenty
of
supplies
they
only
wished
to
push
on
as
soon
as
might
be
at
this
he
waylaid
a
cowering
hillman
among
the
trees
and
after
three
minutes
talk
and
a
little
silver
one
can
not
be
economical
upon
state
service
though
hurree
heart
bled
at
the
waste
the
eleven
coolies
and
the
three
reappeared
at
least
the
babu
would
be
a
witness
to
their
oppression
royal
master
he
will
be
much
annoyed
but
these
people
are
onlee
common
people
and
grossly
ignorant
if
your
honours
will
kindly
overlook
unfortunate
affair
i
shall
be
much
pleased
in
a
little
while
rain
will
stop
and
we
can
then
proceed
you
have
been
shooting
eh
that
is
fine
performance
he
skipped
nimbly
from
one
kilta
to
the
next
making
pretence
to
adjust
each
conical
basket
the
englishman
is
not
as
a
rule
familiar
with
the
asiatic
but
he
would
not
strike
across
the
wrist
a
kindly
babu
who
had
accidentally
upset
a
kilta
with
a
red
oilskin
top
on
the
other
hand
he
would
not
press
drink
upon
a
babu
were
he
never
so
friendly
nor
would
he
invite
him
to
meat
the
strangers
did
all
these
things
and
asked
many
questions
about
women
mostly
to
which
hurree
returned
gay
and
unstudied
answers
they
gave
him
a
glass
of
whitish
fluid
like
to
gin
and
then
more
and
in
a
little
time
his
gravity
departed
from
him
he
became
thickly
treasonous
and
spoke
in
terms
of
sweeping
indecency
of
a
government
which
had
forced
upon
him
a
white
education
and
neglected
to
supply
him
with
a
white
man
salary
he
babbled
tales
of
oppression
and
wrong
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
for
the
miseries
of
his
land
then
he
staggered
off
singing
of
lower
bengal
and
collapsed
upon
a
wet
never
was
so
unfortunate
a
product
of
english
rule
in
india
more
unhappily
thrust
upon
aliens
are
all
just
of
that
pattern
said
one
sportsman
to
the
other
in
french
we
get
into
india
proper
thou
wilt
see
i
should
like
to
visit
his
rajah
one
might
speak
the
good
word
there
it
is
possible
that
he
has
heard
of
us
and
wishes
to
signify
his
have
not
time
we
must
get
into
simla
as
soon
as
may
be
his
companion
replied
my
own
part
i
wish
our
reports
had
been
sent
back
from
hilas
or
even
leh
english
post
is
better
and
safer
remember
we
are
given
all
facilities
and
name
of
god
they
give
them
to
us
too
is
it
unbelievable
stupidity
is
pride
pride
that
deserves
and
will
receive
punishment
to
fight
a
in
our
game
is
something
there
is
a
risk
attached
but
these
people
bah
it
is
too
easy
all
pride
my
friend
what
the
deuce
is
good
of
chandernagore
being
so
close
to
calcutta
and
all
said
hurree
snoring
on
the
sodden
moss
i
can
not
understand
their
french
they
talk
so
particularly
fast
it
would
have
been
much
better
to
cut
their
beastly
throats
when
he
presented
himself
again
he
was
racked
with
a
headache
penitent
and
volubly
afraid
that
in
his
drunkenness
he
might
have
been
indiscreet
he
loved
the
british
government
it
was
the
source
of
all
prosperity
and
honour
and
his
master
at
rampur
held
the
very
same
opinion
upon
this
the
men
began
to
deride
him
and
to
quote
past
words
till
step
by
step
with
deprecating
smirks
oily
grins
and
leers
of
infinite
cunning
the
poor
babu
was
beaten
out
of
his
defences
and
forced
to
speak
truth
when
lurgan
was
told
the
tale
later
he
mourned
aloud
that
he
could
not
have
been
in
the
place
of
the
stubborn
inattentive
coolies
who
with
grass
mats
over
their
heads
and
the
raindrops
puddling
in
their
footprints
waited
on
the
weather
all
the
sahibs
of
their
acquaintance
men
joyously
returning
year
after
year
to
their
chosen
gullies
had
servants
and
cooks
and
orderlies
very
often
hillmen
these
sahibs
travelled
without
any
retinue
therefore
they
were
poor
sahibs
and
ignorant
for
no
sahib
in
his
senses
would
follow
a
bengali
advice
but
the
bengali
appearing
from
somewhere
had
given
them
money
and
could
make
shift
with
their
dialect
used
to
comprehensive
from
their
own
colour
they
suspected
a
trap
somewhere
and
stood
by
to
run
if
occasion
offered
then
through
the
air
steaming
with
delicious
the
babu
led
the
way
down
the
slopes
walking
ahead
of
the
coolies
in
pride
walking
behind
the
foreigners
in
humility
his
thoughts
were
many
and
various
the
least
of
them
would
have
interested
his
companions
beyond
words
but
he
was
an
agreeable
guide
ever
keen
to
point
out
the
beauties
of
his
royal
master
domain
he
peopled
the
hills
with
anything
thev
had
a
mind
to
slay
thar
ibex
or
markhor
and
bear
by
elisha
allowance
he
discoursed
of
botany
and
ethnology
with
unimpeachable
inaccuracy
and
his
store
of
local
legends
he
had
been
a
trusted
agent
of
the
state
for
fifteen
years
remember
was
inexhaustible
this
fellow
is
an
original
said
the
taller
of
the
two
foreigners
is
like
the
nightmare
of
a
viennese
courier
represents
in
little
india
in
transition
the
monstrous
hybridism
of
east
and
west
the
russian
replied
is
we
who
can
deal
with
orientals
has
lost
his
own
country
and
has
not
acquired
any
other
but
he
has
a
most
complete
hatred
of
his
conquerors
listen
he
confided
to
me
last
night
said
the
other
under
the
striped
umbrella
hurree
babu
was
straining
ear
and
brain
to
follow
the
french
and
keeping
both
eyes
on
a
kilta
full
of
maps
and
documents
an
one
with
a
double
red
cover
he
did
not
wish
to
steal
anything
he
only
desired
to
know
what
to
steal
and
incidentally
how
to
get
away
when
he
had
stolen
it
he
thanked
all
the
gods
of
hindustan
and
herbert
spencer
that
there
remained
some
valuables
to
steal
on
the
second
day
the
road
rose
steeply
to
a
grass
spur
above
the
forest
and
it
was
here
about
sunset
that
they
came
across
an
aged
lama
but
they
called
him
a
bonze
sitting
above
a
mysterious
chart
held
down
by
stones
which
he
was
explaining
to
a
young
man
evidently
a
neophyte
of
singular
though
unwashen
beauty
the
striped
umbrella
had
been
sighted
half
a
march
away
and
kim
had
suggested
a
halt
till
it
came
up
to
them
said
hurree
babu
resourceful
as
is
eminent
local
holy
man
probably
subject
of
my
royal
master
is
he
doing
it
is
very
curious
is
expounding
holy
picture
all
the
two
men
stood
bareheaded
in
the
wash
of
the
afternoon
sunlight
low
across
the
grass
the
sullen
coolies
glad
of
the
check
halted
and
slid
down
their
loads
said
the
frenchman
is
like
a
picture
for
the
birth
of
a
religion
the
first
teacher
and
the
first
disciple
is
he
a
buddhist
some
debased
kind
the
other
answered
are
no
true
buddhists
among
the
hills
but
look
at
the
folds
of
the
drapery
look
at
his
eyes
how
insolent
why
does
this
make
one
feel
that
we
are
so
young
a
people
the
speaker
struck
passionately
at
a
tall
weed
have
nowhere
left
our
mark
yet
nowhere
that
do
you
understand
is
what
disquiets
me
he
scowled
at
the
placid
face
and
the
monumental
calm
of
the
pose
patience
we
shall
make
your
mark
together
we
and
you
young
people
meantime
draw
his
picture
the
babu
advanced
loftily
his
back
out
of
all
keeping
with
his
deferential
speech
or
his
wink
towards
kim
one
these
be
sahibs
my
medicines
cured
one
of
a
flux
and
i
go
into
simla
to
oversee
his
recovery
they
wish
to
see
thy
picture
heal
the
sick
is
always
good
this
is
the
wheel
of
life
said
the
lama
same
i
showed
thee
in
the
hut
at
ziglaur
when
the
rain
fell
to
hear
thee
expound
it
the
lama
eyes
lighted
at
the
prospect
of
new
listeners
expound
the
most
excellent
way
is
good
have
they
any
knowledge
of
hindi
such
as
had
the
keeper
of
images
little
maybe
hereat
simply
as
a
child
engrossed
with
a
new
game
the
lama
threw
back
his
head
and
began
the
invocation
of
the
doctor
of
divinity
ere
he
opens
the
full
doctrine
the
strangers
leaned
on
their
alpenstocks
and
listened
kim
squatting
humbly
watched
the
red
sunlight
on
their
faces
and
the
blend
and
parting
of
their
long
shadows
they
wore
leggings
and
curious
belts
that
reminded
him
hazily
of
the
pictures
in
a
book
in
st
xavier
library
the
adventures
of
a
young
naturalist
in
mexico
was
its
name
yes
they
looked
very
like
the
wonderful
sumichrast
of
that
tale
and
very
unlike
the
unscrupulous
folk
of
hurree
babu
imagining
the
coolies
and
mute
crouched
reverently
some
twenty
or
thirty
yards
away
and
the
babu
the
slack
of
his
thin
gear
snapping
like
a
in
the
chill
breeze
stood
by
with
an
air
of
happy
proprietorship
are
the
men
hurree
whispered
as
the
ritual
went
on
and
the
two
whites
followed
the
sweeping
from
hell
to
heaven
and
back
again
their
books
are
in
the
large
kilta
with
the
reddish
top
books
and
reports
and
maps
and
i
have
seen
a
king
letter
that
either
hilas
or
bunar
has
written
they
guard
it
most
carefully
they
have
sent
nothing
back
from
hilas
or
leh
that
is
sure
is
with
them
the
they
have
no
servants
they
are
so
close
they
cook
their
own
food
what
am
i
to
do
and
see
only
if
any
chance
comes
to
me
thou
wilt
know
where
to
seek
for
the
papers
were
better
in
mahbub
ali
hands
than
a
bengali
said
kim
scornfully
are
more
ways
of
getting
to
a
sweetheart
than
butting
down
a
wall
here
the
hell
appointed
for
avarice
and
greed
flanked
upon
the
one
side
by
desire
and
on
the
other
by
weariness
the
lama
warmed
to
his
work
and
one
of
the
strangers
sketched
him
in
the
light
is
enough
the
man
said
at
last
brusquely
can
not
understand
him
but
i
want
that
picture
he
is
a
better
artist
than
i
ask
him
if
he
will
sell
it
says
no
sar
the
babu
replied
the
lama
of
course
would
no
more
have
parted
with
his
chart
to
a
casual
wayfarer
than
an
archbishop
would
pawn
the
holy
vessels
of
his
cathedral
all
tibet
is
full
of
cheap
reproductions
of
the
wheel
but
the
lama
was
an
artist
as
well
as
a
wealthy
abbot
in
his
own
place
in
three
days
or
four
or
ten
if
i
perceive
that
the
sahib
is
a
seeker
and
of
good
understanding
i
may
myself
draw
him
another
but
this
was
used
for
the
initiation
of
a
novice
tell
him
so
hakim
wishes
it
now
for
money
the
lama
shook
his
head
slowly
and
began
to
fold
up
the
wheel
the
russian
on
his
side
saw
no
more
than
an
unclean
old
man
haggling
over
a
dirty
piece
of
paper
he
drew
out
a
handful
of
rupees
and
snatched
at
the
chart
which
tore
in
the
lama
grip
a
low
murmur
of
horror
went
up
from
the
coolies
some
of
whom
were
spiti
men
and
by
their
lights
good
buddhists
the
lama
rose
at
the
insult
his
hand
went
to
the
heavy
iron
pencase
that
is
the
priest
weapon
and
the
babu
danced
in
agony
you
see
you
see
why
i
wanted
witnesses
they
are
highly
unscrupulous
people
oh
sar
sar
you
must
not
hit
holyman
he
has
defiled
the
written
word
it
was
too
late
before
kim
could
ward
him
off
the
russian
struck
the
old
man
full
on
the
face
next
instant
he
was
rolling
over
and
over
downhill
with
kim
at
his
throat
the
blow
had
waked
every
unknown
irish
devil
in
the
boy
blood
and
the
sudden
fall
of
his
enemy
did
the
rest
the
lama
dropped
to
his
knees
the
coolies
under
their
loads
fled
up
the
hill
as
fast
as
plainsmen
run
aross
the
level
they
had
seen
sacrilege
unspeakable
and
it
behoved
them
to
get
away
before
the
gods
and
devils
of
the
hills
took
vengeance
the
frenchman
ran
towards
the
lama
fumbling
at
his
revolver
with
some
notion
of
making
him
a
hostage
for
his
companion
a
shower
of
cutting
stones
hillmen
are
very
straight
shots
drove
him
away
and
a
coolie
from
snatched
the
lama
into
the
stampede
all
came
about
as
swiftly
as
the
sudden
have
taken
the
baggage
and
all
the
guns
yelled
the
frenchman
firing
blindly
into
the
twilight
right
sar
all
right
do
shoot
i
go
to
rescue
and
hurree
pounding
down
the
slope
cast
himself
bodily
upon
the
delighted
and
astonished
kim
who
was
banging
his
breathless
foe
head
against
a
boulder
back
to
the
coolies
whispered
the
babu
in
his
ear
have
the
baggage
the
papers
are
in
the
kilta
with
the
red
top
but
look
through
all
take
their
papers
and
specially
the
murasla
letter
go
the
other
man
comes
kim
tore
uphill
a
rang
on
a
rock
by
his
side
and
he
cowered
you
shoot
shouted
hurree
will
descend
and
annihilate
us
i
have
rescued
the
gentleman
sar
this
is
particularly
dangerous
jove
kim
was
thinking
hard
in
english
is
place
but
i
think
it
is
he
felt
in
his
bosom
for
mahbub
gift
and
uncertainly
save
for
a
few
practice
shots
in
the
bikanir
desert
he
had
never
used
the
little
gun
pulled
the
trigger
did
i
say
sar
the
babu
seemed
to
be
in
tears
down
here
and
assist
to
resuscitate
we
are
all
up
a
tree
i
tell
you
the
shots
ceased
there
was
a
sound
of
stumbling
feet
and
kim
hurried
upward
through
the
gloom
swearing
like
a
cat
or
a
they
wound
thee
chela
called
the
lama
above
him
and
thou
he
dived
into
a
clump
of
stunted
firs
come
away
we
go
with
these
folk
to
not
before
we
have
done
justice
a
voice
cried
have
got
the
sahibs
guns
all
four
let
us
go
down
struck
the
holy
one
we
saw
it
our
cattle
will
be
barren
our
wives
will
cease
to
bear
the
snows
will
slide
upon
us
as
we
go
home
atop
of
all
other
oppression
too
the
little
filled
with
clamouring
coolies
and
in
their
terror
capable
of
anything
the
man
from
clicked
the
of
his
gun
impatiently
and
made
as
to
go
downhill
a
little
holy
one
they
can
not
go
far
wait
till
i
return
said
he
is
this
person
who
has
suffered
wrong
said
the
lama
his
hand
over
his
brow
that
very
reason
was
the
reply
this
person
overlooks
it
your
hands
are
clean
moreover
ye
acquire
merit
by
obedience
and
we
will
all
go
to
shamlegh
together
the
man
insisted
for
a
moment
for
just
so
long
as
it
needs
to
stuff
a
cartridge
into
a
the
lama
hesitated
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
laid
a
finger
on
the
man
shoulder
thou
heard
i
say
there
shall
be
no
killing
i
who
was
abbot
of
is
it
any
lust
of
thine
to
be
as
a
rat
or
a
snake
under
the
eaves
a
worm
in
the
belly
of
the
most
mean
beast
is
it
thy
wish
to
the
man
from
fell
to
his
knees
for
the
voice
boomed
like
a
tibetan
ai
cried
the
spiti
men
not
curse
us
do
not
curse
him
it
was
but
his
zeal
holy
one
put
down
the
rifle
fool
on
anger
evil
on
evil
there
will
be
no
killing
let
the
go
in
bondage
to
their
own
acts
just
and
sure
is
the
wheel
swerving
not
a
hair
they
will
be
born
many
times
in
torment
his
head
drooped
and
he
leaned
heavily
on
kim
shoulder
have
come
near
to
great
evil
chela
he
whispered
in
that
dead
hush
under
the
pines
was
tempted
to
loose
the
bullet
and
truly
in
tibet
there
would
have
been
a
heavy
and
a
slow
death
for
them
he
struck
me
across
the
face
upon
the
flesh
he
slid
to
the
ground
breathing
heavily
and
kim
could
hear
the
heart
bump
and
check
they
hurt
him
to
the
death
said
the
man
while
the
others
stood
mute
kim
knelt
over
the
body
in
deadly
fear
he
cried
passionately
is
only
a
weakness
then
he
remembered
that
he
was
a
white
man
with
a
white
man
at
his
service
the
kiltas
the
sahibs
may
have
a
medicine
then
i
know
it
said
the
man
with
a
laugh
for
five
years
was
i
yankling
sahib
shikarri
without
knowing
that
medicine
i
too
have
tasted
it
behold
he
drew
from
his
breast
a
bottle
of
cheap
whisky
such
as
is
sold
to
explorers
at
leh
and
cleverly
forced
a
little
between
the
lama
teeth
i
did
when
yankling
sahib
twisted
his
foot
beyond
astor
aha
i
have
already
looked
into
their
baskets
but
we
will
make
fair
division
at
shamlegh
give
him
a
little
more
it
is
good
medicine
feel
his
heart
goes
better
now
lay
his
head
down
and
rub
a
little
on
the
chest
if
he
had
waited
quietly
while
i
accounted
for
the
sahibs
this
would
never
have
come
but
perhaps
the
sahibs
may
chase
us
here
then
it
would
not
be
wrong
to
shoot
them
with
their
own
guns
heh
is
paid
i
think
already
said
kim
between
his
teeth
kicked
him
in
the
groin
as
we
went
downhill
would
i
had
killed
him
is
well
to
be
brave
when
one
does
not
live
in
rampur
said
one
whose
hut
lay
within
a
few
miles
of
the
rajah
rickety
palace
we
get
a
bad
name
among
the
sahibs
none
will
employ
us
as
shikarris
any
more
but
these
are
not
angrezi
sahibs
not
men
like
fostum
sahib
or
yankling
sahib
they
are
foreigners
they
can
not
speak
angrezi
as
do
sahibs
here
the
lama
coughed
and
sat
up
groping
for
the
rosary
shall
be
no
killing
he
murmured
is
the
wheel
evil
on
evil
holy
one
we
are
all
here
the
man
timidly
patted
his
feet
by
thy
order
no
one
shall
be
slain
rest
awhile
we
will
make
a
little
camp
here
and
later
as
the
moon
rises
we
go
to
a
blow
said
a
spiti
man
sententiously
is
best
to
sleep
is
as
it
were
a
dizziness
at
the
back
of
my
neck
and
a
pinching
in
it
let
me
lay
my
head
on
thy
lap
chela
i
am
an
old
man
but
not
free
from
passion
we
must
think
of
the
cause
of
things
him
a
blanket
we
dare
not
light
a
fire
lest
the
sahibs
see
get
away
to
shamlegh
none
will
follow
us
to
shamlegh
this
was
the
nervous
rampur
man
have
been
fostum
sahib
shikarri
and
i
am
yankling
shikarri
i
should
have
been
with
yankling
sahib
now
but
for
this
cursed
beegar
the
corvee
let
two
men
watch
below
with
the
guns
lest
the
sahibs
do
more
foolishness
i
shall
not
leave
this
holy
one
they
sat
down
a
little
apart
from
the
lama
and
after
listening
awhile
passed
round
a
whose
receiver
was
an
old
day
and
martin
the
glow
of
the
red
charcoal
as
it
went
from
hand
to
hand
lit
up
the
narrow
blinking
eyes
the
high
chinese
and
the
that
melted
away
into
the
dark
duffle
folds
round
the
shoulders
they
looked
like
kobolds
from
some
magic
mine
gnomes
of
the
hills
in
conclave
and
while
they
talked
the
voices
of
the
round
them
diminished
one
by
one
as
the
choked
and
clogged
the
runnels
he
stood
up
against
us
said
a
spiti
man
admiring
remember
an
old
ibex
out
that
dupont
sahib
missed
on
a
seven
seasons
back
standing
up
just
like
him
dupont
sahib
was
a
good
shikarri
as
good
as
yankling
sahib
the
man
took
a
pull
at
the
and
passed
it
over
hear
me
unless
any
other
man
thinks
he
knows
more
the
challenge
was
not
taken
up
go
to
shamlegh
when
the
moon
rises
there
we
will
fairly
divide
the
baggage
between
us
i
am
content
with
this
new
little
rifle
and
all
its
cartridges
the
bears
only
bad
on
thy
holding
said
a
mate
sucking
at
the
pipe
but
are
worth
six
rupees
apiece
now
and
thy
women
can
have
the
canvas
of
the
tents
and
some
of
the
we
will
do
all
that
at
shamlegh
before
dawn
then
we
all
go
our
ways
remembering
that
we
have
never
seen
or
taken
service
with
these
sahibs
who
may
indeed
say
that
we
have
stolen
their
baggage
is
well
for
thee
but
what
will
our
rajah
say
is
to
tell
him
those
sahibs
who
can
not
speak
our
talk
or
the
babu
who
for
his
own
ends
gave
us
money
will
he
lead
an
army
against
us
what
evidence
will
remain
that
we
do
not
need
we
shall
throw
on
where
no
man
has
yet
set
foot
is
at
shamlegh
this
summer
the
place
was
only
a
grazing
centre
of
three
or
four
huts
woman
of
shamlegh
she
has
no
love
for
sahibs
as
we
know
the
others
can
be
pleased
with
little
presents
and
here
is
enough
for
us
all
he
patted
the
fat
sides
of
the
nearest
basket
but
have
said
they
are
not
true
sahibs
all
their
skins
and
heads
were
bought
in
the
bazar
at
leh
i
know
the
marks
i
showed
them
to
ye
last
march
they
were
all
bought
skins
and
heads
some
had
even
the
moth
in
them
that
was
a
shrewd
argument
and
the
man
knew
his
fellows
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
i
shall
tell
yankling
sahib
who
is
a
man
of
a
merry
mind
and
he
will
laugh
we
are
not
doing
any
wrong
to
any
sahibs
whom
we
know
they
are
they
frightened
us
we
fled
who
knows
where
we
dropped
the
baggage
do
ye
think
yankling
sahib
will
permit
police
to
wander
all
over
the
hills
disturbing
his
game
it
is
a
far
cry
from
simla
to
chini
and
farther
from
shamlegh
to
be
it
but
i
carry
the
big
kilta
the
basket
with
the
red
top
that
the
sahibs
pack
themselves
every
morning
it
is
proved
said
the
shamlegh
man
adroitly
they
are
sahibs
of
no
account
who
ever
heard
of
fostum
sahib
or
yankling
sahib
or
even
the
little
peel
sahib
that
sits
up
of
nights
to
shoot
serow
i
say
who
ever
heard
of
these
sahibs
coming
into
the
hills
without
a
cook
and
a
bearer
and
and
all
manner
of
and
oppressive
folk
in
their
tail
how
can
they
make
trouble
what
of
the
kilta
but
that
it
is
full
of
the
written
word
books
and
papers
in
which
they
wrote
and
strange
instruments
as
of
worship
will
take
them
all
but
how
if
we
insult
the
sahibs
gods
thereby
i
do
not
like
to
handle
the
written
word
in
that
fashion
and
their
brass
idols
are
beyond
my
comprehension
it
is
no
plunder
for
simple
old
man
still
sleeps
hst
we
will
ask
his
chela
the
man
refreshed
himself
and
swelled
with
pride
of
leadership
have
here
he
whispered
kilta
whose
nature
we
do
not
know
i
do
said
kim
cautiously
the
lama
drew
breath
in
natural
easy
sleep
and
kim
had
been
thinking
of
hurree
last
words
as
a
player
of
the
great
game
he
was
disposed
just
then
to
reverence
the
babu
is
a
kilta
with
a
red
top
full
of
very
wonderful
things
not
to
be
handled
by
fools
said
it
i
said
it
cried
the
bearer
of
that
burden
thou
it
will
betray
us
if
it
be
given
to
me
i
can
draw
out
its
magic
otherwise
it
will
do
great
harm
priest
always
takes
his
share
whisky
was
demoralizing
the
man
is
no
matter
to
me
kim
answered
with
the
craft
of
his
it
among
you
and
see
what
comes
i
was
only
jesting
give
the
order
there
is
more
than
enough
for
us
all
we
go
our
way
from
shamlegh
in
the
dawn
they
arranged
and
their
artless
little
plans
for
another
hour
while
kim
shivered
with
cold
and
pride
the
humour
of
the
situation
tickled
the
irish
and
the
oriental
in
his
soul
here
were
the
emissaries
of
the
dread
power
of
the
north
very
possibly
as
great
in
their
own
land
as
mahbub
or
colonel
creighton
suddenly
smitten
helpless
one
of
them
he
privately
knew
would
be
lame
for
a
time
they
had
made
promises
to
kings
tonight
they
lay
out
somewhere
below
him
chartless
foodless
tentless
gunless
except
for
hurree
babu
guideless
and
this
collapse
of
their
great
game
kim
wondered
to
whom
they
would
report
it
this
panicky
bolt
into
the
night
had
come
about
through
no
craft
of
hurree
or
contrivance
of
kim
but
simply
beautifully
and
inevitably
as
the
capture
of
mahbub
by
the
zealous
young
policeman
at
umballa
are
there
with
nothing
and
by
jove
it
is
cold
i
am
here
with
all
their
things
oh
they
will
be
angry
i
am
sorry
for
hurree
babu
kim
might
have
saved
his
pity
for
though
at
that
moment
the
bengali
suffered
acutely
in
the
flesh
his
soul
was
puffed
and
lofty
a
mile
down
the
hill
on
the
edge
of
the
two
men
one
powerfully
sick
at
intervals
were
varying
mutual
recriminations
with
the
most
poignant
abuse
of
the
babu
who
seemed
distraught
with
terror
they
demanded
a
plan
of
action
he
explained
that
they
were
very
lucky
to
be
alive
that
their
coolies
if
not
then
stalking
them
had
passed
beyond
recall
that
the
rajah
his
master
was
ninety
miles
away
and
so
far
from
lending
them
money
and
a
retinue
for
the
simla
journey
would
surely
cast
them
into
prison
if
he
heard
that
they
had
hit
a
priest
he
enlarged
on
this
sin
and
its
consequences
till
they
bade
him
change
the
subject
their
one
hope
said
he
was
unostentatious
flight
from
village
to
village
till
they
reached
civilization
and
for
the
hundredth
time
dissolved
in
tears
he
demanded
of
the
high
stars
why
the
sahibs
beaten
holy
man
ten
steps
would
have
taken
hurree
into
the
creaking
gloom
utterly
beyond
their
reach
to
the
shelter
and
food
of
the
nearest
village
where
doctors
were
scarce
but
he
preferred
to
endure
cold
bad
words
and
occasional
blows
in
the
company
of
his
honoured
employers
crouched
against
a
he
sniffed
dolefully
have
you
thought
said
the
uninjured
man
hotly
sort
of
spectacle
we
shall
present
wandering
through
these
hills
among
these
aborigines
hurree
babu
had
thought
of
little
else
for
some
hours
but
the
remark
was
not
to
his
address
can
not
wander
i
can
hardly
walk
groaned
kim
victim
the
holy
man
will
be
merciful
in
sar
otherwise
promise
myself
a
peculiar
pleasure
in
emptying
my
revolver
into
that
young
bonze
when
next
we
meet
was
the
unchristian
answer
vengeance
bonzes
hurree
crouched
lower
the
war
was
breaking
out
afresh
you
no
consideration
for
our
loss
the
baggage
the
baggage
he
could
hear
the
speaker
literally
dancing
on
the
grass
we
bore
everything
we
have
secured
our
gains
eight
months
work
do
you
know
what
that
means
decidedly
it
is
we
who
can
deal
with
orientals
oh
you
have
done
well
they
fell
to
it
in
several
tongues
and
hurree
smiled
kim
was
with
the
kiltas
and
in
the
kiltas
lay
eight
months
of
good
diplomacy
there
was
no
means
of
communicating
with
the
boy
but
he
could
be
trusted
for
the
rest
hurree
could
so
the
journey
through
the
hills
that
hilas
bunar
and
four
hundred
miles
of
should
tell
the
tale
for
a
generation
men
who
can
not
control
their
own
coolies
are
little
respected
in
the
hills
and
the
hillman
has
a
very
keen
sense
of
humour
i
had
done
it
myself
thought
hurree
would
not
have
been
better
and
by
jove
now
i
think
of
it
of
course
i
arranged
it
myself
how
quick
i
have
been
just
when
i
ran
downhill
i
thought
it
thee
outrage
was
accidental
but
onlee
me
could
have
worked
it
ah
for
all
it
was
worth
consider
the
moral
effect
upon
these
ignorant
peoples
no
treaties
no
papers
no
written
documents
at
all
and
me
to
interpret
for
them
how
i
shall
laugh
with
the
colonel
i
wish
i
had
their
papers
also
but
you
can
not
occupy
two
places
in
space
simultaneously
thatt
is
axiomatic
chapter
my
brother
kneels
so
saith
kabir
to
stone
and
brass
in
heathen
wise
but
in
my
brother
voice
i
hear
my
own
unanswered
agonies
his
god
is
as
his
fates
assign
his
prayer
is
all
the
world
and
mine
the
prayer
at
moonrise
the
cautious
coolies
got
under
way
the
lama
refreshed
by
his
sleep
and
the
spirit
needed
no
more
than
kim
shoulder
to
bear
him
along
a
silent
man
they
held
the
grass
for
an
hour
swept
round
the
shoulder
of
an
immortal
cliff
and
climbed
into
a
new
country
entirely
blocked
off
from
all
sight
of
chini
valley
a
huge
ran
up
to
the
living
snow
at
its
base
was
perhaps
half
an
acre
of
flat
land
on
which
stood
a
few
soil
and
timber
huts
behind
them
for
they
were
perched
on
the
edge
of
all
things
the
ground
fell
sheer
two
thousand
feet
to
where
never
yet
man
has
set
foot
the
men
made
no
motion
to
divide
the
plunder
till
they
had
seen
the
lama
bedded
down
in
the
best
room
of
the
place
with
kim
shampooing
his
feet
will
send
food
said
the
man
the
kilta
by
dawn
there
will
be
none
to
give
evidence
one
way
or
the
other
if
anything
is
not
needed
in
the
kilta
see
here
he
pointed
through
the
window
opening
into
space
that
was
filled
with
moonlight
reflected
from
the
snow
and
threw
out
an
empty
need
to
listen
for
the
fall
this
is
the
world
end
he
said
and
went
out
the
lama
looked
forth
a
hand
on
either
sill
with
eyes
that
shone
like
yellow
opals
from
the
enormous
pit
before
him
white
peaks
lifted
themselves
yearning
to
the
moonlight
the
rest
was
as
the
darkness
of
interstellar
space
he
said
slowly
indeed
my
hills
thus
should
a
man
abide
perched
above
the
world
separated
from
delights
considering
vast
matters
if
he
has
a
chela
to
prepare
tea
for
him
and
to
fold
a
blanket
for
his
head
and
to
chase
out
calving
cows
a
smoky
lamp
burned
in
a
niche
but
the
full
moonlight
beat
it
down
and
by
the
mixed
light
stooping
above
the
and
cups
kim
moved
like
a
tall
ghost
but
now
i
have
let
the
blood
cool
my
head
still
beats
and
drums
and
there
is
a
cord
round
the
back
of
my
neck
wonder
it
was
a
strong
blow
may
he
who
dealt
it
for
my
own
passions
there
would
have
been
no
evil
evil
thou
hast
saved
the
sahibs
from
the
death
they
deserved
a
hundred
times
lesson
is
not
well
learnt
chela
the
lama
came
to
rest
on
a
folded
blanket
as
kim
went
forward
with
his
evening
routine
blow
was
but
a
shadow
upon
a
shadow
evil
in
itself
my
legs
weary
apace
these
latter
days
it
met
evil
in
me
anger
rage
and
a
lust
to
return
evil
these
wrought
in
my
blood
woke
tumult
in
my
stomach
and
dazzled
my
ears
here
he
drank
scalding
ceremonially
taking
the
hot
cup
from
kim
hand
i
been
passionless
the
evil
blow
would
have
done
only
bodily
evil
a
scar
or
a
bruise
which
is
illusion
but
my
mind
was
not
abstracted
for
rushed
in
straightway
a
lust
to
let
the
spiti
men
kill
in
fighting
that
lust
my
soul
was
torn
and
wrenched
beyond
a
thousand
blows
not
till
i
had
repeated
the
blessings
he
meant
the
buddhist
beatitudes
i
achieve
calm
but
the
evil
planted
in
me
by
that
moment
carelessness
works
out
to
its
end
just
is
the
wheel
swerving
not
a
hair
learn
the
lesson
chela
is
too
high
for
me
kim
muttered
am
still
all
shaken
i
am
glad
i
hurt
the
man
felt
that
sleeping
upon
thy
knees
in
the
wood
below
it
disquieted
me
in
my
dreams
the
evil
in
thy
soul
working
through
to
mine
yet
on
the
other
hand
he
loosed
his
rosary
have
acquired
merit
by
saving
two
lives
the
lives
of
those
that
wronged
me
now
i
must
see
into
the
cause
of
things
the
boat
of
my
soul
staggers
and
be
strong
that
is
wisest
meditate
there
is
a
need
greater
than
thou
knowest
till
the
dawn
hour
after
hour
as
the
moonlight
paled
on
the
high
peaks
and
that
which
had
been
belted
blackness
on
the
sides
of
the
far
hills
showed
as
tender
green
forest
the
lama
stared
fixedly
at
the
wall
from
time
to
time
he
groaned
outside
the
barred
door
where
discomfited
kine
came
to
ask
for
their
old
stable
shamlegh
and
the
coolies
gave
itself
up
to
plunder
and
riotous
living
the
man
was
their
leader
and
once
they
had
opened
the
sahibs
tinned
foods
and
found
that
they
were
very
good
they
dared
not
turn
back
shamlegh
took
the
dunnage
when
kim
after
a
night
of
bad
dreams
stole
forth
to
brush
his
teeth
in
the
morning
chill
a
woman
with
headgear
drew
him
aside
others
have
gone
they
left
thee
this
kilta
as
the
promise
was
i
do
not
love
sahibs
but
thou
wilt
make
us
a
charm
in
return
for
it
we
do
not
wish
little
shamlegh
to
get
a
bad
name
on
account
of
the
accident
i
am
the
woman
of
shamlegh
she
looked
him
over
with
bold
bright
eyes
unlike
the
usual
furtive
glance
of
hillwomen
but
it
must
be
done
in
secret
she
raised
the
heavy
kilta
like
a
toy
and
slung
it
into
her
own
hut
and
bar
the
door
let
none
come
near
till
it
is
finished
said
kim
afterwards
we
may
talk
kim
tilted
the
kilta
on
the
floor
a
cascade
of
books
diaries
letters
maps
and
queerly
scented
native
correspondence
at
the
very
bottom
was
an
embroidered
bag
covering
a
sealed
gilded
and
illuminated
document
such
as
one
king
sends
to
another
kim
caught
his
breath
with
delight
and
reviewed
the
situation
from
a
sahib
point
of
view
books
i
do
not
want
besides
they
are
logarithms
survey
i
suppose
he
laid
them
aside
letters
i
do
not
understand
but
colonel
creighton
will
they
must
all
be
kept
the
maps
they
draw
better
maps
than
me
of
course
all
the
native
letters
oho
and
particularly
the
murasla
he
sniffed
the
embroidered
bag
must
be
from
hilas
or
bunar
and
hurree
babu
spoke
truth
by
jove
it
is
a
fine
haul
i
wish
hurree
could
know
the
rest
must
go
out
of
the
window
he
fingered
a
superb
prismatic
compass
and
the
shiny
top
of
a
theodolite
but
after
all
a
sahib
can
not
very
well
steal
and
the
things
might
be
inconvenient
evidence
later
he
sorted
out
every
scrap
of
manuscript
every
map
and
the
native
letters
they
made
one

he
repacked
the
kilta
with
all
he
meant
to
lose
and
hove
it
up
on
to
the
windowsill
a
thousand
feet
below

a
long
lazy
bank
of
mist
as
yet
untouched
by
the
morning
sun
a
thousand
feet
below

looking

the

and
exploded
like
a
shell
the
books
inkstands
compasses
and
rulers
showed
for
a
few
seconds
like
a
swarm
of
bees
then
they
vanished
and
though
kim
hanging
half
out
of
the
window
strained
his
young
ears
never
a
sound
came
up
from
the
gulf

a
thousand
rupees

not
buy
them
he
thought
sorrowfully
was
verree
wasteful
but
i
have
all
their
other
stuff
everything
they
did
i
hope
now
how
the
deuce

i
to
tell
hurree
babu
and
whatt
the
deuce
am
i
to
do
and
my
old
man
is
sick
i
must
tie
up
the
letters
in
oilskin
that
is
something
to
do
first
else
they
will
get
all
sweated
and
i
am
all
alone
he
bound
them
into
a
neat
packet

down
the
stiff
sticky
oilskin
at
the
comers
for
his
roving
life
had
made
him
as
methodical
as
an
old
hunter
in
matters
of
the
road
then
with
double
care
he
packed
away
the
books
at
the
bottom
of
the
the
woman
rapped
at
the
door
thou
hast
made
no
charm
she
said
looking
about
is
no
need
kim
had
completely
overlooked
the
necessity
for
a
little
the
woman
laughed
at
his
confusion
irreverently
for
thee
thou
canst
cast
a
spell
by
the
mere
winking
of
an
eye
but
think
of
us
poor
people
when
thou
art
gone
they
were
all
too
drunk
last
night
to
hear
a
woman
thou
art
not
drunk
am
a
priest
kim
had
recovered
himself
and
the
woman
being
aught
but
unlovely
thought
best
to
stand
on
his
office
warned
them
that
the
sahibs
will
be
angry
and
will
make
an
inquisition
and
a
report
to
the
rajah
there
is
also
the
babu
with
them
clerks
have
long
tongues
that
all
thy
trouble
the
plan
rose
fully
formed
in
kim
mind
and
he
smiled
ravishingly
all
quoth
the
woman
putting
out
a
hard
brown
hand
all
covered
with
turquoises
set
in
silver
can
finish
that
in
a
breath
he
went
on
quickly
babu
is
the
very
hakim
thou
hast
heard
of
him
who
was
wandering
among
the
hills
by
ziglaur
i
know
him
will
tell
for
the
sake
of
a
reward
sahibs
can
not
distinguish
one
hillman
from
another
but
babus
have
eyes
for
men
and
women
a
word
to
him
from
me
is
nothing
i
would
not
do
for
thee
he
accepted
the
compliment
calmly
as
men
must
in
lands
where
women
make
the
love
tore
a
leaf
from
a
and
with
a
patent
indelible
pencil
wrote
in
gross
shikast
the
script
that
bad
little
boys
use
when
they
write
dirt
on
walls
have
everything
that
they
have
written
their
pictures
of
the
country
and
many
letters
especially
the
murasla
tell
me
what
to
do
i
am
at
the
old
man
is
sick
this
to
him
it
will
altogether
shut
his
mouth
he
can
not
have
gone
far
no
they
are
still
in
the
forest
across
the
spur
our
children
went
to
watch
them
when
the
light
came
and
have
cried
the
news
as
they
moved
kim
looked
his
astonishment
but
from
the
edge
of
the
floated
a
shrill
trill
a
child
tending
cattle
had
picked
it
up
from
a
brother
or
sister
on
the
far
side
of
the
slope
that
commanded
chini
valley
husbands
are
also
out
there
gathering
wood
she
drew
a
handful
of
walnuts
from
her
bosom
split
one
neatly
and
began
to
eat
kim
affected
blank
ignorance
thou
not
know
the
meaning
of
the
walnut
priest
she
said
coyly
and
handed
him
the
thought
of
he
slipped
the
piece
of
paper
between
them
quickly
thou
a
little
wax
to
close
them
on
this
letter
the
woman
sighed
aloud
and
kim
relented
is
no
payment
till
service
has
been
rendered
carry
this
to
the
babu
and
say
it
was
sent
by
the
son
of
the
charm
truly
truly
by
a
magician
who
is
like
a
sahib
a
son
of
the
charm
and
ask
if
there
be
any
answer
if
he
offer
a
rudeness
i
i
am
afraid
kim
laughed
is
i
have
no
doubt
very
tired
and
very
hungry
the
hills
make
cold
bedfellows
hai
my
it
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
to
say
mother
but
he
turned
it
to
sister
art
a
wise
and
witty
woman
by
this
time
all
the
villages
know
what
has
befallen
the
sahibs
eh
news
was
at
ziglaur
by
midnight
and
by
tomorrow
should
be
at
kotgarh
the
villages
are
both
afraid
and
angry
need
tell
the
villages
to
feed
the
sahibs
and
pass
them
on
in
peace
we
must
get
them
quietly
away
from
our
valleys
to
steal
is
one
thing
to
kill
another
the
babu
will
understand
and
there
will
be
no
be
swift
i
must
tend
my
master
when
he
wakes
be
it
after
service
thou
hast
said
comes
the
reward

am
the
woman
of
shamlegh
and
i
hold
from

rajah
i
am
no
common
bearer
of

thine

and

and

and
butter

or
leave
she
turned
resolutely
uphill
her
silver
necklaces
clicking
on
her
broad
breast
to
meet
the
morning
sun
fifteen
hundred
feet
above
them
this
time
kim
thought
in
the
vernacular
as
he
waxed
down
the
oilskin
edges
of
the
packets
can
a
man
follow
the
way
or
the
great
game
when
he
is
so
always
pestered
by
women
there
was
that
girl
at
akrola
of
the
ford
and
there
was
the
scullion
wife
behind
the
dovecot
not
counting
the
others
and
now
comes
this
one
when
i
was
a
child
it
was
well
enough
but
now
i
am
a
man
and
they
will
not
regard
me
as
a
man
walnuts
indeed
ho
ho
it
is
almonds
in
the
plains
he
went
out
to
levy
on
the
village
not
with
a
which
might
do
for
but
in
the
manner
of
a
prince
summer
population
is
only
three
families
four
women
and
eight
or
nine
men
they
were
all
full
of
tinned
meats
and
mixed
drinks
from
ammoniated
quinine
to
white
vodka
for
they
had
taken
their
full
share
in
the
overnight
loot
the
neat
continental
tents
had
been
cut
up
and
shared
long
ago
and
there
were
patent
aluminium
saucepans
abroad
but
they
considered
the
lama
presence
a
perfect
safeguard
against
all
consequences
and
impenitently
brought
kim
of
their
best
even
to
a
drink
of
chang
the
that
comes
from
then
they
thawed
out
in
the
sun
and
sat
with
their
legs
hanging
over
infinite
abysses
chattering
laughing
and
smoking
they
judged
india
and
its
government
solely
from
their
experience
of
wandering
sahibs
who
had
employed
them
or
their
friends
as
shikarris
kim
heard
tales
of
shots
missed
upon
ibex
serow
or
markhor
by
sahibs
twenty
years
in
their
graves
every
detail
lighted
from
behind
like
twigs
on
seen
against
lightning
they
told
him
of
their
little
diseases
and
more
important
the
diseases
of
their
tiny
cattle
of
trips
as
far
as
kotgarh
where
the
strange
missionaries
live
and
beyond
even
to
marvellous
simla
where
the
streets
are
paved
with
silver
and
anyone
look
you
can
get
service
with
the
sahibs
who
ride
about
in
carts
and
spend
money
with
a
spade
presently
grave
and
aloof
walking
very
heavily
the
lama
joined
himself
to
the
chatter
under
the
eaves
and
they
gave
him
great
room
the
thin
air
refreshed
him
and
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
precipices
with
the
best
of
them
and
when
talk
languished
flung
pebbles
into
the
void
thirty
miles
away
as
the
eagle
flies
lay
the
next
range
seamed
and
channelled
and
pitted
with
little
patches
of
brush
forests
each
a
day
dark
march
behind
the
village
shamlegh
hill
itself
cut
off
all
view
to
southward
it
was
like
sitting
in
a
swallow
nest
under
the
eaves
of
the
roof
of
the
world
from
time
to
time
the
lama
stretched
out
his
hand
and
with
a
little
prompting
would
point
out
the
road
to
spiti
and
north
across
the
parungla
where
the
hills
lie
thickest
lies
he
meant
great
monastery
built
it
and
of
him
there
runs
this
tale
whereupon
he
told
it
a
fantastic
piled
narrative
of
bewitchment
and
miracles
that
set
shamlegh
turning
west
a
little
he
steered
for
the
green
hills
of
kulu
and
sought
kailung
under
the
glaciers
thither
came
i
in
the
old
old
days
from
leh
i
came
over
the
baralachi
yes
we
know
it
said
the
people
of
shamlegh
i
slept
two
nights
with
the
priests
of
kailung
these
are
the
hills
of
my
delight
shadows
blessed
above
all
other
shadows
there
my
eyes
opened
on
this
world
there
my
eyes
were
opened
to
this
world
there
i
found
enlightenment
and
there
i
girt
my
loins
for
my
search
out
of
the
hills
i
came
the
high
hills
and
the
strong
winds
oh
just
is
the
wheel
he
blessed
them
in
detail
the
great
glaciers
the
naked
rocks
the
piled
moraines
and
tumbled
shale
dry
upland
hidden
timber
and
fruitful
valley
one
after
the
other
as
a
dying
man
blesses
his
folk
and
kim
marvelled
at
his
passion
yes
there
is
no
place
like
our
hills
said
the
people
of
shamlegh
and
they
fell
to
wondering
how
a
man
could
live
in
the
hot
terrible
plains
where
the
cattle
run
as
big
as
elephants
unfit
to
plough
on
a
hillside
where
village
touches
village
they
had
heard
for
a
hundred
miles
where
folk
went
about
stealing
in
gangs
and
what
the
robbers
spared
the
police
carried
utterly
away
so
the
still
forenoon
wore
through
and
at
the
end
of
it
messenger
dropped
from
the
steep
pasture
as
unbreathed
as
when
she
had
set
out
sent
a
word
to
the
hakim
kim
explained
while
she
made
reverence
joined
himself
to
the
idolaters
nay
i
remember
he
did
a
healing
upon
one
of
them
he
has
acquired
merit
though
the
healed
employed
his
strength
for
evil
just
is
the
wheel
what
of
the
hakim
feared
that
thou
hadst
been
bruised
and
and
i
knew
he
was
wise
kim
took
the
waxed
and
read
in
english
on
the
back
of
his
note
your
favour
received
can
not
get
away
from
present
company
at
present
but
shall
take
them
into
simla
after
which
hope
to
rejoin
you
inexpedient
to
follow
angry
gentlemen
return
by
same
road
you
came
and
will
overtake
highly
gratified
about
correspondence
due
to
my
forethought
says
holy
one
that
he
will
escape
from
the
idolaters
and
will
return
to
us
shall
we
wait
awhile
at
shamlegh
then
the
lama
looked
long
and
lovingly
upon
the
hills
and
shook
his
head
may
not
be
chela
from
my
bones
outward
i
do
desire
it
but
it
is
forbidden
i
have
seen
the
cause
of
things
when
the
hills
give
thee
back
thy
strength
day
by
day
remember
we
were
weak
and
fainting
down
below
there
in
the
doon
became
strong
to
do
evil
and
to
forget
a
brawler
and
a
swashbuckler
upon
the
hillsides
was
i
kim
bit
back
a
smile
and
perfect
is
the
wheel
swerving
not
a
hair
when
i
was
a
man
a
long
time
ago
i
did
pilgrimage
to
guru
among
the
poplars
he
pointed
bhotanwards
they
keep
the
sacred
horse
be
quiet
said
shamlegh
all
arow
speaks
of
the
horse
that
can
go
round
the
world
in
a
day
speak
to
my
chela
only
said
the
lama
in
gentle
reproof
and
they
scattered
like
frost
on
south
eaves
of
a
morning
did
not
seek
truth
in
those
days
but
the
talk
of
doctrine
all
illusion
i
drank
the
beer
and
ate
the
bread
of
guru
next
day
one
said
we
go
out
to
fight
sangor
gutok
down
the
valley
to
discover
mark
again
how
lust
is
tied
to
anger
which
abbot
shall
bear
rule
in
the
valley
and
take
the
profit
of
the
prayers
they
print
at
sangor
gutok
i
went
and
we
fought
a
day
how
holy
one
our
long
pencases
as
i
could
have
shown
i
say
we
fought
under
the
poplars
both
abbots
and
all
the
monks
and
one
laid
open
my
forehead
to
the
bone
see
he
tilted
back
his
cap
and
showed
a
puckered
silvery
scar
and
perfect
is
the
wheel
yesterday
the
scar
itched
and
after
fifty
years
i
recalled
how
it
was
dealt
and
the
face
of
him
who
dealt
it
dwelling
a
little
in
illusion
followed
that
which
thou
didst
see
strife
and
stupidity
just
is
the
wheel
the
idolater
blow
fell
upon
the
scar
then
i
was
shaken
in
my
soul
my
soul
was
darkened
and
the
boat
of
my
soul
rocked
upon
the
waters
of
illusion
not
till
i
came
to
shamlegh
could
i
meditate
upon
the
cause
of
things
or
trace
the
running
of
evil
i
strove
all
the
long
night
holy
one
thou
art
innocent
of
all
evil
may
i
be
thy
sacrifice
kim
was
genuinely
distressed
at
the
old
man
sorrow
and
mahbub
phrase
slipped
out
unawares
the
dawn
the
lama
went
on
more
gravely
ready
rosary
clicking
between
the
slow
sentences
enlightenment
it
is
here
i
am
an
old
man
never
to
sit
down
among
my
hills
three
years
i
travelled
through
hind
but
can
earth
be
stronger
than
mother
earth
my
stupid
body
yearned
to
the
hills
and
the
snows
of
the
hills
from
below
there
i
said
and
it
is
true
my
search
is
sure
so
at
the
kulu
woman
house
i
turned
hillward
by
myself
there
is
no
blame
to
the
hakim
he
following
desire
foretold
that
the
hills
would
make
me
strong
they
strengthened
me
to
do
evil
to
forget
my
search
i
delighted
in
life
and
the
lust
of
life
i
desired
strong
slopes
to
climb
i
cast
about
to
find
them
i
measured
the
strength
of
my
body
which
is
evil
against
the
high
hills
i
made
a
mock
of
thee
when
thy
breath
came
short
under
jamnotri
i
jested
when
thou
wouldst
not
face
the
snow
of
the
pass
what
harm
i
was
afraid
it
was
just
i
am
not
a
hillman
and
i
loved
thee
for
thy
new
strength
than
once
i
remember
he
rested
his
cheek
dolefully
on
his
hand
sought
thy
praise
and
the
hakim
for
the
mere
strength
of
my
legs
thus
evil
followed
evil
till
the
cup
was
full
just
is
the
wheel
all
hind
for
three
years
did
me
all
honour
from
the
fountain
of
wisdom
in
the
wonder
house
to
he
smiled
little
child
playing
by
a
big
gun
the
world
prepared
my
road
and
why
we
loved
thee
it
is
only
the
fever
of
the
blow
i
myself
am
still
sick
and
shaken
it
was
because
i
was
upon
the
way
tuned
as
are
cymbals
to
the
purpose
of
the
law
i
departed
from
that
ordinance
the
tune
was
broken
followed
the
punishment
in
my
own
hills
on
the
edge
of
my
own
country
in
the
very
place
of
my
evil
desire
comes
the
buffet
here
he
touched
his
brow
a
novice
is
beaten
when
he
misplaces
the
cups
so
am
i
beaten
who
was
abbot
of
no
word
look
you
but
a
blow
chela
the
sahibs
did
not
know
thee
holy
one
were
well
matched
ignorance
and
lust
met
ignorance
and
lust
upon
the
road
and
they
begat
anger
the
blow
was
a
sign
to
me
who
am
no
better
than
a
strayed
yak
that
my
place
is
not
here
who
can
read
the
cause
of
an
act
is
halfway
to
freedom
back
to
the
path
says
the
blow
the
hills
are
not
for
thee
thou
canst
not
choose
freedom
and
go
in
bondage
to
the
delight
of
life
we
had
never
met
that
cursed
russian
lord
himself
can
not
make
the
wheel
swing
backward
and
for
my
merit
that
i
had
acquired
i
gain
yet
another
sign
he
put
his
hand
in
his
bosom
and
drew
forth
the
wheel
of
life
i
considered
this
after
i
had
meditated
there
remains
untorn
by
the
idolater
no
more
than
the
breadth
of
my
fingernail
see
much
then
is
the
span
of
my
life
in
this
body
i
have
served
the
wheel
all
my
days
now
the
wheel
serves
me
but
for
the
merit
i
have
acquired
in
guiding
thee
upon
the
way
there
would
have
been
added
to
me
yet
another
life
ere
i
had
found
my
river
is
it
plain
chela
kim
stared
at
the
brutally
disfigured
chart
from
left
to
right
diagonally
the
rent
ran
from
the
eleventh
house
where
desire
gives
birth
to
the
child
as
it
is
drawn
by
tibetans
across
the
human
and
animal
worlds
to
the
fifth
house
the
empty
house
of
the
senses
the
logic
was
unanswerable
our
lord
won
enlightenment
the
lama
folded
all
away
with
reverence
was
tempted
i
too
have
been
tempted
but
it
is
finished
the
arrow
fell
in
the
plains
not
in
the
hills
therefore
what
make
we
here
we
at
least
wait
for
the
hakim
know
how
long
i
shall
live
in
this
body
what
can
a
hakim
do
thou
art
all
sick
and
shaken
thou
canst
not
walk
can
i
be
sick
if
i
see
freedom
he
rose
unsteadily
to
his
feet
i
must
get
food
from
the
village
oh
the
weary
road
kim
felt
that
he
too
needed
rest
is
lawful
let
us
eat
and
go
the
arrow
fell
in
the
plains
but
i
yielded
to
desire
make
ready
chela
kim
turned
to
the
woman
with
the
turquoise
headgear
who
had
been
idly
pitching
pebbles
over
the
cliff
she
smiled
very
kindly
found
him
like
a
strayed
buffalo
in
a
cornfield
the
babu
snorting
and
sneezing
with
cold
he
was
so
hungry
that
he
forgot
his
dignity
and
gave
me
sweet
words
the
sahibs
have
nothing
she
flung
out
an
empty
palm
is
very
sick
about
the
stomach
thy
work
kim
nodded
with
a
bright
eye
spoke
to
the
bengali
first
and
to
the
people
of
a
village
after
the
sahibs
will
be
given
food
as
they
need
it
nor
will
the
people
ask
money
the
plunder
is
already
distributed
the
babu
makes
lying
speeches
to
the
sahibs
why
does
he
not
leave
them
of
the
greatness
of
his
heart
never
a
bengali
yet
had
one
bigger
than
a
dried
walnut
but
it
is
no
matter
now
as
to
walnuts
after
service
comes
reward
i
have
said
the
village
is
thine
is
my
loss
kim
began
now
i
had
planned
desirable
things
in
my
heart
which
there
is
no
need
to
go
through
the
compliments
proper
to
these
occasions
he
sighed
deeply
my
master
led
by
a
vision
what
can
old
eyes
see
except
a
full
turns
from
this
village
to
the
plains
again
him
stay
kim
shook
his
head
know
my
holy
one
and
his
rage
if
he
be
crossed
he
replied
impressively
curses
shake
the
hills
they
did
not
save
him
from
a
broken
head
i
heard
that
thou
wast
the
one
who
smote
the
sahib
let
him
dream
a
little
longer
stay
said
kim
with
austerity
that
could
not
harden
the
outlines
of
his
young
oval
face
matters
are
too
high
for
thee
gods
be
good
to
us
since
when
have
men
and
women
been
other
than
men
and
women
priest
is
a
priest
he
says
he
will
go
upon
this
hour
i
am
his
chela
and
i
go
with
him
we
need
food
for
the
road
he
is
an
honoured
guest
in
all
the
villages
but
he
broke
into
a
pure
grin
food
here
is
good
give
me
some
if
i
do
not
give
it
thee
i
am
the
woman
of
this
village
i
curse
thee
a
little
not
greatly
but
enough
to
remember
he
could
not
help
smiling
hast
cursed
me
already
by
the
eyelash
and
the
uplifted
chin
curses
what
should
i
care
for
mere
words
she
clenched
her
hands
upon
her
bosom
i
would
not
have
thee
to
go
in
anger
thinking
hardly
of
me
a
gatherer
of
and
grass
at
shamlegh
but
still
a
woman
of
substance
think
nothing
said
kim
that
i
am
grieved
to
go
for
i
am
very
weary
and
that
we
need
food
here
is
the
bag
the
woman
snatched
it
angrily
was
foolish
said
she
is
thy
woman
in
the
plains
fair
or
black
i
was
fair
once
laughest
thou
once
long
ago
if
thou
canst
believe
a
sahib
looked
on
me
with
favour
once
long
ago
i
wore
european
clothes
at
the
yonder
she
pointed
towards
kotgarh
long
ago
i
was
and
spoke
english
as
the
sahibs
speak
it
yes
my
sahib
said
he
would
return
and
wed
me
yes
wed
me
he
went
away
i
had
nursed
him
when
he
was
sick
but
he
never
returned
then
i
saw
that
the
gods
of
the
kerlistians
lied
and
i
went
back
to
my
own
people
i
have
never
set
eyes
on
a
sahib
since
do
not
laugh
at
me
the
fit
is
past
little
priestling
thy
face
and
thy
walk
and
thy
fashion
of
speech
put
me
in
mind
of
my
sahib
though
thou
art
only
a
wandering
mendicant
to
whom
i
give
a
dole
curse
me
thou
canst
neither
curse
nor
bless
she
set
her
hands
on
her
hips
and
laughed
bitterly
gods
are
lies
thy
works
are
lies
thy
words
are
lies
there
are
no
gods
under
all
the
heavens
i
know
it
but
for
awhile
i
thought
it
was
my
sahib
come
back
and
he
was
my
god
yes
once
i
made
music
on
a
pianno
in
the
at
kotgarh
now
i
give
alms
to
priests
who
are
heatthen
she
wound
up
with
the
english
word
and
tied
the
mouth
of
the
brimming
bag
wait
for
thee
chela
said
the
lama
leaning
against
the
the
woman
swept
the
tall
figure
with
her
eyes
walk
he
can
not
cover
half
a
mile
whither
would
old
bones
go
at
this
kim
already
perplexed
by
the
lama
collapse
and
foreseeing
the
weight
of
the
bag
fairly
lost
his
temper
is
it
to
thee
woman
of
where
he
goes
but
something
to
thee
priest
with
a
sahib
face
wilt
thou
carry
him
on
thy
shoulders
go
to
the
plains
none
must
hinder
my
return
i
have
wrestled
with
my
soul
till
i
am
strengthless
the
stupid
body
is
spent
and
we
are
far
from
the
plains
she
said
simply
and
drew
aside
to
let
kim
see
his
own
utter
helplessness
me
maybe
it
will
give
him
strength
make
a
charm
call
on
thy
great
god
thou
art
a
priest
she
turned
away
the
lama
had
squatted
limply
still
holding
by
the
one
can
not
strike
down
an
old
man
that
he
recovers
again
like
a
boy
in
the
night
weakness
bowed
him
to
the
earth
but
his
eyes
that
hung
on
kim
were
alive
and
imploring
is
all
well
said
kim
is
the
thin
air
that
weakens
thee
in
a
little
while
we
go
it
is
the
i
too
am
a
little
sick
at
stomach
and
he
knelt
and
comforted
with
such
poor
words
as
came
first
to
his
lips
then
the
woman
returned
more
erect
than
ever
gods
useless
heh
try
mine
i
am
the
woman
of
shamlegh
she
hailed
hoarsely
and
there
came
out
of
a
her
two
husbands
and
three
others
with
a
dooli
the
rude
native
litter
of
the
hills
that
they
use
for
carrying
the
sick
and
for
visits
of
state
cattle
she
did
not
condescend
to
look
at
them
thine
for
so
long
as
thou
shalt
need
we
will
not
go
we
will
not
go
near
the
sahibs
cried
the
first
husband
will
not
run
away
as
the
others
did
nor
will
they
steal
baggage
two
i
know
for
weaklings
stand
to
the
sonoo
and
taree
they
obeyed
swiftly
now
and
lift
in
that
holy
man
i
will
see
to
the
village
and
your
virtuous
wives
till
ye
return
will
that
be
the
priests
do
not
pester
me
lay
the
at
the
foot
it
balances
better
so
holy
one
thy
hills
are
kinder
than
our
plains
cried
kim
relieved
as
the
lama
tottered
to
the
litter
is
a
very
bed
a
place
of
honour
and
ease
and
we
owe
it
to
woman
of
i
need
thy
blessings
as
much
as
i
do
thy
curses
it
is
my
order
and
none
of
thine
lift
and
away
here
hast
thou
money
for
the
road
she
beckoned
kim
to
her
hut
and
stooped
above
a
battered
english
under
her
cot
do
not
need
anything
said
kim
angered
where
he
should
have
been
grateful
am
already
rudely
loaded
with
favours
she
looked
up
with
a
curious
smile
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
least
thank
me
i
am
and
a
hillwoman
but
as
thy
talk
goes
i
have
acquired
merit
shall
i
show
thee
how
the
sahibs
render
thanks
and
her
hard
eyes
softened
am
but
a
wandering
priest
said
kim
his
eyes
lighting
in
answer
needest
neither
my
blessings
nor
my
curses
but
for
one
little
moment
thou
canst
overtake
the
dooli
in
ten
strides
if
thou
wast
a
sahib
shall
i
show
thee
what
thou
wouldst
do
if
i
guess
though
said
kim
and
putting
his
arm
round
her
waist
he
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
adding
in
english
you
verree
much
my
dear
kissing
is
practically
unknown
among
asiatics
which
may
have
been
the
reason
that
she
leaned
back
with
eyes
and
a
face
of
panic
time
kim
went
on
must
not
be
so
sure
of
your
heatthen
priests
now
i
say
he
held
out
his
hand
she
took
it
mechanically
my
dear
and
and
she
was
remembering
her
english
words
one
by
one
will
come
back
again
and
thee
god
bless
you
half
an
hour
later
as
the
creaking
litter
jolted
up
the
hill
path
that
leads
from
shamlegh
kim
saw
a
tiny
figure
at
the
hut
door
waving
a
white
rag
has
acquired
merit
beyond
all
others
said
the
lama
to
set
a
man
upon
the
way
to
freedom
is
half
as
great
as
though
she
had
herself
found
it
said
kim
thoughtfully
considering
the
past
may
be
that
i
have
acquired
merit
also
at
least
she
did
not
treat
me
like
a
child
he
hitched
the
front
of
his
robe
where
lay
the
slab
of
documents
and
maps
the
precious
at
the
lama
feet
laid
his
hand
on
the
litter
edge
and
buckled
down
to
the
slow
pace
of
the
grunting
husbands
also
acquire
merit
said
the
lama
after
three
miles
than
that
they
shall
be
paid
in
silver
quoth
kim
the
woman
of
shamlegh
had
given
it
to
him
and
it
was
only
fair
he
argued
that
her
men
should
earn
it
back
again

unskilfully
to

which
leads
to
the
great
and

it
was
not
his
fault
that
blanketed
by
wet
mists
he
conveyed
them
past
the
and
european
colony
of
kotgarh
it
was
not
his
fault
but
that
of
the
gods
of
whom
he
discoursed
so
engagingly
that
he
led
them
into
the
borders
of
nahan
where
the
rahah
of
that
state
mistook
them

a
skilful
leech
for
an
injury
of
the
groin
such
a
blow
as
one
may
receive
rolling
down
a
hillside
in
the
dark
and
in
all
things
indispensable
the
reason
of
his
friendliness
did
him
credit
with
millions
of
he
had
learned
to
look
upon
russia
as
the
great
deliverer
from
the
north
he
was
a
fearful
man
he
had
been
afraid
that
he
could
not
save
his
illustrious
employers
from
the
anger
of
an
excited
peasantry
he
himself
would
just
as
lief
hit
a
holy
man
as
not
but
he
was
deeply
grateful
and
sincerely
rejoiced
that
he
had
done
his
possible
towards
bringing
their
venture
to
barring
the
lost
baggage
a
successful
issue
he
had
forgotten
the
blows
denied
that
any
blows
had
been
dealt
that
unseemly
first
night
under
the
pines
he
asked
neither
pension
nor
retaining
fee
but
if
they
deemed
him
worthy
would
they
write
him
a
testimonial
it
might
be
useful
to
him
later
if
others
their
friends
came
over
the
passes
he
begged
them
to
remember
him
in
their
future
greatnesses
for
he
subtly
that
he
even
he
mohendro
lal
dutt
ma
of
calcutta
had
the
state
some
service
they
gave
him
a
certificate
praising
his
courtesy
helpfulness
and
unerring
skill
as
a
guide
he
put
it
in
his
and
sobbed
with
emotion
they
had
endured
so
many
dangers
together
he
led
them
at
high
noon
along
crowded
simla
mall
to
the
alliance
bank
of
simla
where
they
wished
to
establish
their
identity
thence
he
vanished

him
too
to

too
pressed
to
vaunt

drugs
in
his
little
box
ascending

just
man
made
perfect

him

aside
smoking
at
noon
on
a
cot
while
a
woman
with
headgear
points
across
the
bare
grass
litters
she
says
do
not
travel
as
fast
as
single
men
but
his
birds
should
now
be
in
the
plains
the
holy
man
would
not
stay
though
lispeth
pressed
him
the
babu
groans
heavily
girds
up
his
huge
loins
and
is
off
again
he
does
not
care
to
travel
after
dusk
but
his
days
marches
there
is
none
to
enter
them
in
a

would
astonish

mock
at

kindly

his

good

full
sahibs
prices
twelve
miles
a
day
has
the
dooli
travelled
as
the
greasy
rubbed
show
and
by
roads
that
few
sahibs
use
over
the
nilang
pass
in
storm
when
the
driven
filled
every
fold
of
the
impassive
lama
drapery
between
the
black
horns
of
raieng
where
they
heard
the
whistle
of
the
wild
goats
through
the
clouds
pitching
and
strained
on
the
shale
below
between
shoulder
and
clenched
jaw
when
they
rounded
the
hideous
curves
of
the
cut
road
under
bhagirati
swinging
and
creaking
to
the
steady
of
the
descent
into
the
valley
of
the
waters
pressed
along
the
steamy
levels
of
that
locked
valley
up
up
and
out
again
to
meet
the
roaring
gusts
off
kedarnath
set
down
of
in
the
dun
gloom
of
kindly
passed
from
village
to
village
in
when
even
devotees
may
be
forgiven
for
swearing
at
impatient
holy
men
or
by
torchlight
when
the
least
fearful
think
of
ghosts
the
dooli
has
reached
her
last
stage
the
little
sweat
in
the
modified
heat
of
the
lower
siwaliks
and
gather
round
the
priests
for
their
blessing
and
their
wage
have
acquired
merit
says
the
lama
greater
than
your
knowing
and
ye
will
return
to
the
hills
he
sighs
the
high
hills
as
soon
as
may
be
the
bearer
rubs
his
shoulder
drinks
water
spits
it
out
again
and
readjusts
his
grass
sandal
kim
his
face
is
drawn
and
tired
pays
very
small
silver
from
his
belt
heaves
out
the
crams
an
oilskin
packet
they
are
holy
writings
into
his
bosom
and
helps
the
lama
to
his
feet
the
peace
has
come
again
into
the
old
man
eyes
and
he
does
not
look
for
the
hills
to
fall
down
and
crush
him
as
he
did
that
terrible
night
when
they
were
delayed
by
the
flooded
river
the
men
pick
up
the
dooli
and
swing
out
of
sight
between
the
scrub
clumps
the
lama
raises
a
hand
toward
the
rampart
of
the
himalayas
with
you
o
blessed
among
all
hills
fell
the
arrow
of
our
lord
and
never
shall
i
breathe
your
airs
again
thou
art
ten
times
the
stronger
man
in
this
good
air
says
kim
for
to
his
wearied
soul
appeal
the
kindly
plains
or
hereabouts
fell
the
arrow
yes
we
will
go
very
softly
perhaps
a
koss
a
day
for
the
search
is
sure
but
the
bag
weighs
heavy
our
search
is
sure
i
have
come
out
of
great
temptation
it
was
never
more
than
a
couple
of
miles
a
day
now
and
kim
shoulders
bore
all
the
weight
of
it
the
burden
of
an
old
man
the
burden
of
the
heavy
with
the
locked
books
the
load
of
the
writings
on
his
heart
and
the
details
of
the
daily
routine
he
begged
in
the
dawn
set
blankets
for
the
lama
meditation
held
the
weary
head
on
his
lap
through
the
noonday
heats
fanning
away
the
flies
till
his
wrists
ached
begged
again
in
the
evenings
and
rubbed
the
lama
feet
who
rewarded
him
with
promise
of
freedom
today
tomorrow
or
at
furthest
the
next
day
was
such
a
chela
i
doubt
at
times
whether
ananda
more
faithfully
nursed
our
lord
and
thou
art
a
sahib
when
i
was
a
man
a
long
time
ago
i
forgot
that
now
i
look
upon
thee
often
and
every
time
i
remember
that
thou
art
a
sahib
it
is
strange
hast
said
there
is
neither
black
nor
white
why
plague
me
with
this
talk
holy
one
let
me
rub
the
other
foot
it
vexes
me
i
am
not
a
sahib
i
am
thy
chela
and
my
head
is
heavy
on
my
shoulders
a
little
we
reach
freedom
together
then
thou
and
i
upon
the
far
bank
of
the
river
will
look
back
upon
our
lives
as
in
the
hills
we
saw
our
days
marches
laid
out
behind
us
perhaps
i
was
once
a
sahib
never
a
sahib
like
thee
i
swear
it
am
certain
the
keeper
of
the
images
in
the
wonder
house
was
in
past
life
a
very
wise
abbot
but
even
his
spectacles
do
not
make
my
eyes
see
there
fall
shadows
when
i
would
look
steadily
no
matter
we
know
the
tricks
of
the
poor
stupid
carcass
shadow
changing
to
another
shadow
i
am
bound
by
the
illusion
of
time
and
space
how
far
came
we
today
in
the
flesh
half
a
koss
three
quarters
of
a
mile
and
it
was
a
weary
march
a
koss
ha
i
went
ten
thousand
thousand
in
the
spirit
how
we
are
all
lapped
and
swathed
and
swaddled
in
these
senseless
things
he
looked
at
his
thin
hand
that
found
the
beads
so
heavy
hast
thou
never
a
wish
to
leave
me
kim
thought
of
the
oilskin
packet
and
the
books
in
the
if
someone
duly
authorized
would
only
take
delivery
of
them
the
great
game
might
play
itself
for
aught
he
then
cared
he
was
tired
and
hot
in
his
head
and
a
cough
that
came
from
the
stomach
worried
him
he
said
almost
sternly
am
not
a
dog
or
a
snake
to
bite
when
i
have
learned
to
love
art
too
tender
towards
me
that
either
i
have
moved
in
one
matter
without
consulting
thee
i
have
sent
a
message
to
the
kulu
woman
by
that
woman
who
gave
us
the
goat
milk
this
morn
saying
that
thou
wast
a
little
feeble
and
wouldst
need
a
litter
i
beat
myself
in
my
mind
that
i
did
not
do
it
when
we
entered
the
doon
we
stay
in
this
place
till
the
litter
returns
am
content
she
is
a
woman
with
a
heart
of
gold
as
thou
sayest
but
a
talker
something
of
a
talker
will
not
weary
thee
i
have
looked
to
that
also
holy
one
my
heart
is
very
heavy
for
my
many
carelessnesses
towards
thee
an
hysterical
catch
rose
in
his
throat
have
walked
thee
too
far
i
have
not
picked
good
food
always
for
thee
i
have
not
considered
the
heat
i
have
talked
to
people
on
the
road
and
left
thee
alone
i
have
i
have
hai
mai
but
i
love
thee
and
it
is
all
too
late
i
was
a
child
oh
why
was
i
not
a
man
overborne
by
strain
fatigue
and
the
weight
beyond
his
years
kim
broke
down
and
sobbed
at
the
lama
feet
a
is
here
said
the
old
man
gently
hast
never
stepped
a
hair
breadth
from
the
way
of
obedience
neglect
me
child
i
have
lived
on
thy
strength
as
an
old
tree
lives
on
the
lime
of
a
new
wall
day
by
day
since
shamlegh
down
i
have
stolen
strength
from
thee
therefore
not
through
any
sin
of
thine
art
thou
weakened
it
is
the
body
the
silly
stupid
body
that
speaks
now
not
the
assured
soul
be
comforted
know
at
least
the
devils
that
thou
fightest
they
are
children
of
illusion
we
will
go
to
the
woman
from
kulu
she
shall
acquire
merit
in
housing
us
and
specially
in
tending
me
thou
shalt
run
free
till
strength
returns
i
had
forgotten
the
stupid
body
if
there
be
any
blame
i
bear
it
but
we
are
too
close
to
the
gates
of
deliverance
to
weigh
blame
i
could
praise
thee
but
what
need
in
a
little
in
a
very
little
we
shall
sit
beyond
all
needs
and
so
he
petted
and
comforted
kim
with
wise
saws
and
grave
texts
on
that
beast
our
body
who
being
but
a
delusion
insists
on
posing
as
the
soul
to
the
darkening
of
the
way
and
the
immense
multiplication
of
unnecessary
devils
hai
let
us
talk
of
the
woman
from
kulu
think
you
she
will
ask
another
charm
for
her
grandsons
when
i
was
a
young
man
a
very
long
time
ago
i
was
plagued
with
these
vapours
and
some
others
and
i
went
to
an
abbot
a
very
holy
man
and
a
seeker
after
truth
though
then
i
knew
it
not
sit
up
and
listen
child
of
my
soul
my
tale
was
told
said
he
to
me
chela
know
this
there
are
many
lies
in
the
world
and
not
a
few
liars
but
there
are
no
liars
like
our
bodies
except
it
be
the
sensations
of
our
bodies
considering
this
i
was
comforted
and
of
his
great
favour
he
suffered
me
to
drink
tea
in
his
presence
suffer
me
now
to
drink
tea
for
i
am
thirsty
with
a
laugh
across
his
tears
kim
kissed
the
lama
feet
and
set
about
the
leanest
on
me
in
the
body
holy
one
but
i
lean
on
thee
for
some
other
things
dost
know
it
have
guessed
maybe
and
the
lama
eyes
twinkled
must
change
that
so
when
with
scufflings
and
scrapings
and
a
hot
air
of
importance
paddled
up
nothing
less
than
the
sahiba
pet
palanquin
sent
twenty
miles
with
that
same
grizzled
old
oorya
servant
in
charge
and
when
they
reached
the
disorderly
order
of
the
long
white
rambling
house
behind
saharunpore
the
lama
took
his
own
measures
said
the
sahiba
cheerily
from
an
upper
window
after
compliments
is
the
good
of
an
old
woman
advice
to
an
old
man
i
told
thee
i
told
thee
holy
one
to
keep
an
eye
upon
the
chela
how
didst
thou
do
it
never
answer
me
i
know
he
has
been
running
among
the
women
look
at
his
eyes
hollow
and
sunk
and
the
betraying
line
from
the
nose
down
he
has
been
sifted
out
fie
fie
and
a
priest
too
kim
looked
up
to
smile
shaking
his
head
in
denial
not
jest
said
the
lama
time
is
done
we
are
here
upon
great
matters
a
sickness
of
soul
took
me
in
the
hills
and
him
a
sickness
of
the
body
since
then
i
have
lived
upon
his
strength
eating
him
together
young
and
old
she
sniffed
but
forbore
to
make
any
new
jokes
this
present
hospitality
restore
ye
hold
awhile
and
i
will
come
to
gossip
of
the
high
good
hills
at
evening
time
her
was
returned
so
she
did
not
need
to
go
on
inspection
round
the
farm
she
won
to
the
meat
of
the
matter
explained
by
the
lama
the
two
old
heads
nodded
wisely
together
kim
had
reeled
to
a
room
with
a
cot
in
it
and
was
dozing
soddenly
the
lama
had
forbidden
him
to
set
blankets
or
get
food
know
i
know
who
but
i
she
cackled
who
go
down
to
the
clutch
at
the
hands
of
those
coming
up
from
the
river
of
life
with
full
yes
brimming
i
did
the
boy
wrong
he
lent
thee
his
strength
it
is
true
that
the
old
eat
the
young
daily
stands
now
we
must
restore
him
hast
many
times
acquired
merit
merit
what
is
it
old
bag
of
bones
making
curries
for
men
who
do
not
ask
who
cooked
this
now
if
it
were
stored
up
for
my
grandson
that
had
the
think
the
holy
one
remembers
that
i
must
tell
his
mother
it
is
most
singular
honour
he
that
had
the
straightway
the
holy
one
remembered
she
will
be
proud
chela
is
to
me
as
is
a
son
to
the
unenlightened
grandson
rather
mothers
have
not
the
wisdom
of
our
years
if
a
child
cries
they
say
the
heavens
are
falling
now
a
grandmother
is
far
enough
separated
from
the
pain
of
bearing
and
the
pleasure
of
giving
the
breast
to
consider
whether
a
cry
is
wickedness
pure
or
the
wind
and
since
thou
speakest
once
again
of
wind
when
last
the
holy
one
was
here
maybe
i
offended
in
pressing
for
charms
said
the
lama
using
that
form
of
address
a
buddhist
monk
may
sometimes
employ
towards
a
nun
charms
comfort
thee
are
better
than
ten
thousand
doctors
say
if
they
comfort
thee
i
who
was
abbot
of
will
make
as
many
as
thou
mayest
desire
i
have
never
seen
thy
face
even
the
monkeys
who
steal
our
loquats
count
for
again
hee
hee
as
he
who
sleeps
there
said
he
nodded
at
the
shut
door
of
the
across
the
forecourt
hast
a
heart
of
gold
and
he
is
in
the
spirit
my
very
grandson
to
me
i
am
the
holy
one
cow
this
was
pure
hinduism
but
the
lama
never
heeded
am
old
i
have
borne
sons
in
the
body
oh
once
i
could
please
men
now
i
can
cure
them
he
heard
her
armlets
tinkle
as
though
she
bared
arms
for
action
will
take
over
the
boy
and
dose
him
and
stuff
him
and
make
him
all
whole
hai
hai
we
old
people
know
something
yet
wherefore
when
kim
aching
in
every
bone
opened
his
eyes
and
would
go
to
the
to
get
his
master
food
he
found
strong
coercion
about
him
and
a
veiled
old
figure
at
the
door
flanked
by
the
grizzled
manservant
who
told
him
very
precisely
the
things
that
he
was
on
no
account
to
do
must
have
thou
shalt
have
nothing
what
a
locked
box
in
which
to
keep
holy
books
oh
that
is
another
matter
heavens
forbid
i
should
come
between
a
priest
and
his
prayers
it
shall
be
brought
and
thou
shalt
keep
the
key
they
pushed
the
coffer
under
his
cot
and
kim
shut
away
pistol
the
oilskin
packet
of
letters
and
the
locked
books
and
diaries
with
a
groan
of
relief
for
some
absurd
reason
their
weight
on
his
shoulders
was
nothing
to
their
weight
on
his
poor
mind
his
neck
ached
under
it
of
nights
is
a
sickness
uncommon
in
youth
these
days
since
young
folk
have
given
up
tending
their
betters
the
remedy
is
sleep
and
certain
drugs
said
the
sahiba
and
he
was
glad
to
give
himself
up
to
the
blankness
that
half
menaced
and
half
soothed
him
she
brewed
drinks
in
some
mysterious
asiatic
equivalent
to
the
drenches
that
smelt
pestilently
and
tasted
worse
she
stood
over
kim
till
they
went
down
and
inquired
exhaustively
after
they
had
come
up
she
laid
a
taboo
upon
the
forecourt
and
enforced
it
by
means
of
an
armed
man
it
is
true
he
was
seventy
odd
that
his
scabbarded
sword
ceased
at
the
hilt
but
he
represented
the
authority
of
the
sahiba
and
loaded
wains
chattering
servants
calves
dogs
hens
and
the
like
fetched
a
wide
compass
by
those
parts
best
of
all
when
the
body
was
cleared
she
cut
out
from
the
mass
of
poor
relations
that
crowded
the
back
of
the
buildings
dogs
we
name
them
a
cousin
widow
skilled
in
what
europeans
who
know
nothing
about
it
call
massage
and
the
two
of
them
laying
him
east
and
west
that
the
mysterious
which
thrill
the
clay
of
our
bodies
might
help
and
not
hinder
took
him
to
pieces
all
one
long
afternoon
bone
by
bone
muscle
by
muscle
ligament
by
ligament
and
lastly
nerve
by
nerve
kneaded
to
irresponsible
pulp
half
hypnotized
by
the
perpetual
flick
and
readjustment
of
the
uneasy
chudders
that
veiled
their
eyes
kim
slid
ten
thousand
miles
into
slumber
hours
of
it
sleep
that
soaked
like
rain
after
drought
then
she
fed
him
and
the
house
spun
to
her
clamour
she
caused
fowls
to
be
slain
she
sent
for
vegetables
and
the
sober
gardener
nigh
as
old
as
she
sweated
for
it
she
took
spices
and
milk
and
onion
with
little
fish
from
the
brooks
anon
limes
for
sherbets
fat
quails
from
the
pits
then
upon
a
skewer
with
sliced
ginger
between
have
seen
something
of
this
world
she
said
over
the
crowded
trays
there
are
but
two
sorts
of
women
in
it
those
who
take
the
strength
out
of
a
man
and
those
who
put
it
back
once
i
was
that
one
and
now
i
am
this
nay
do
not
play
the
priestling
with
me
mine
was
but
a
jest
if
it
does
not
hold
good
now
it
will
when
thou
takest
the
road
again
cousin
this
to
the
poor
relation
never
wearied
of
extolling
her
patroness
charity
is
getting
a
bloom
on
the
skin
of
a
horse
our
work
is
like
polishing
jewels
to
be
thrown
to
a
eh
kim
sat
up
and
smiled
the
terrible
weakness
had
dropped
from
him
like
an
old
shoe
his
tongue
itched
for
free
speech
again
and
but
a
week
back
the
lightest
word
clogged
it
like
ashes
the
pain
in
his
neck
he
must
have
caught
it
from
the
lama
had
gone
with
the
heavy
and
the
evil
taste
in
the
mouth
the
two
old
women
a
little
but
not
much
more
careful
about
their
veils
now
clucked
as
merrily
as
the
hens
that
had
entered
pecking
through
the
open
door
is
my
holy
one
he
demanded
him
thy
holy
one
is
well
she
snapped
viciously
that
is
none
of
his
merit
knew
i
a
charm
to
make
him
wise
i
sell
my
jewels
and
buy
it
to
refuse
good
food
that
i
cooked
myself
and
go
roving
into
the
fields
for
two
nights
on
an
empty
belly
and
to
tumble
into
a
brook
at
the
end
of
it
call
you
that
holiness
then
when
he
has
nearly
broken
what
thou
hast
left
of
my
heart
with
anxiety
he
tells
me
that
he
has
acquired
merit
oh
how
like
are
all
men
no
that
was
not
it
he
tells
me
that
he
is
freed
from
all
sin
i
could
have
told
him
that
before
he
wetted
himself
all
over
he
is
well
now
this
happened
a
week
ago
but
burn
me
such
holiness
a
babe
of
three
would
do
better
do
not
fret
thyself
for
the
holy
one
he
keeps
both
eyes
on
thee
when
he
is
not
wading
our
brooks
do
not
remember
to
have
seen
him
i
remember
that
the
days
and
nights
passed
like
bars
of
white
and
black
opening
and
shutting
i
was
not
sick
i
was
but
tired
lethargy
that
comes
by
right
some
few
score
years
later
but
it
is
done
now
kim
began
but
led
by
the
look
in
her
eye
changed
it
to
the
title
of
plain
love
i
owe
my
life
to
thee
how
shall
i
make
thanks
ten
thousand
blessings
upon
thy
house
and
house
be
unblessed
it
is
impossible
to
give
exactly
the
old
lady
word
the
gods
as
a
priest
if
thou
wilt
but
thank
me
if
thou
carest
as
a
son
heavens
above
have
i
shifted
thee
and
lifted
thee
and
slapped
and
twisted
thy
ten
toes
to
find
texts
flung
at
my
head
somewhere
a
mother
must
have
borne
thee
to
break
her
heart
what
used
thou
to
her
son
had
no
mother
my
mother
said
kim
died
they
tell
me
when
i
was
young
mai
then
none
can
say
i
have
robbed
her
of
any
right
if
when
thou
takest
the
road
again
and
this
house
is
but
one
of
a
thousand
used
for
shelter
and
forgotten
after
an
blessing
no
matter
i
need
no
blessings
but
but
she
stamped
her
foot
at
the
poor
relation
up
the
trays
to
the
house
what
is
the
good
of
stale
food
in
the
room
o
woman
of
ha
have
borne
a
son
in
my
time
too
but
he
died
whimpered
the
bowed
behind
the
chudder
knowest
he
died
i
only
waited
for
the
order
to
take
away
the
tray
is
i
that
am
the
woman
of
cried
the
old
lady
penitently
that
go
down
to
the
chattris
the
big
umbrellas
above
the
where
the
priests
take
their
last
dues
clutch
hard
at
the
bearers
of
the
chattis
young
folk
full
of
the
pride
of
life
she
meant
but
the
pun
is
clumsy
when
one
can
not
dance
in
the
festival
one
must
look
out
of
the
window
and
grandmothering
takes
all
a
woman
time
thy
master
gives
me
all
the
charms
i
now
desire
for
my
daughter
eldest
by
reason
is
it
that
he
is
wholly
free
from
sin
the
hakim
is
brought
very
low
these
days
he
goes
about
poisoning
my
servants
for
lack
of
their
betters
hakim
mother
very
dacca
man
who
gave
me
the
pill
which
rent
me
in
three
pieces
he
cast
up
like
a
strayed
camel
a
week
ago
vowing
that
he
and
thou
had
been
together
up
and
feigning
great
anxiety
for
thy
health
he
was
very
thin
and
hungry
so
i
gave
orders
to
have
him
stuffed
too
him
and
his
anxiety
would
see
him
if
he
is
here
eats
five
times
a
day
and
lances
boils
for
my
hinds
to
save
himself
from
an
apoplexy
he
is
so
full
of
anxiety
for
thy
health
that
he
sticks
to
the
door
and
stays
himself
with
scraps
he
will
keep
we
shall
never
get
rid
of
him
him
here
mother
the
twinkle
returned
to
kim
eye
for
a
flash
i
will
try
send
him
but
to
chase
him
off
is
an
ill
turn
at
least
he
had
the
sense
to
fish
the
holy
one
out
of
the
brook
thus
as
the
holy
one
did
not
say
acquiring
merit
is
a
very
wise
hakim
send
him
mother
praising
priest
a
miracle
if
he
is
any
friend
of
thine
ye
squabbled
at
your
last
meeting
i
hale
him
here
with
and
and
give
him
a
afterwards
my
son
get
up
and
see
the
world
this
lying
abed
is
the
mother
of
seventy
devils
my
son
my
son
she
trotted
forth
to
raise
a
typhoon
off
the
and
almost
on
her
shadow
rolled
in
the
babu
robed
as
to
the
shoulders
like
a
roman
emperor
jowled
like
titus
with
new
shoes
in
highest
condition
of
fat
exuding
joy
and
salutations
jove
mister
but
i
are
to

the
kilta
the
maps
and
the
murasla
he
held
out
the
key
impatiently
for
the
present
need
on
his
soul
was
to
get
rid
of
the
loot
are
quite
right
that
is
correct
departmental
view
to
take
you

got
everything
that
was
handwritten
in
the
kilta
i
took
the
rest
i
threw
down
the
hill
he
could
hear
the
key
grate
in
the
lock
the
sticky
pull
of
the
oilskin
and
a
quick
shuffling
of
papers
he
had
been
annoyed
out
of
all
reason
by
the
knowledge
that
they
lay
below
him
through
the
sick
idle
days
a
burden
incommunicable
for
that
reason
the
blood
tingled
through
his
body
when
hurree
skipping
elephantinely
shook
hands
again
is
fine
this
is
finest
mister
you
have
ha
ha
swiped
the
whole
bag
of
tricks
locks
stocks
and
barrels
they
told
me
it
was
eight
months
work
gone
up
the
spouts
by
jove
how
they
beat
me
look
here
is
the
letter
from
hilas
he
intoned
a
line
or
two
of
court
persian
which
is
the
language
of
authorized
and
unauthorized
diplomacy
rajah
sahib
has
just
about
put
his
foot
in
the
holes
he
will
have
to
explain
offeecially
how
the
he
is
writing
to
the
czar
and
they
are
very
clever
maps
and
there
is
three
or
four
prime
ministers
of
these
parts
implicated
by
the
correspondence
by
gad
sar
the
british
government
will
change
the
succession
in
hilas
and
bunar
and
nominate
new
heirs
to
the
throne
most
base
but
you
do
not
understand
eh
they
in
thy
hands
said
kim
it
was
all
he
cared
for
you
bet
yourself
they
are
he
stowed
the
entire
trove
about
his
body
as
only
orientals
can
are
going
up
to
the
office
too
the
old
lady
thinks
i
am
permanent
fixture
here
but
i
shall
go
away
with
these
straight
off
immediately
mr
lurgan
will
be
proud
man
you
are
offeecially
subordinate
to
me
but
i
shall
embody
your
name
in
my
verbal
report
it
is
a
pity
we
are
not
allowed
written
reports
we
bengalis
excel
in
thee
exact
science
he
tossed
back
the
key
and
showed
the
box
empty
that
is
good
i
was
very
tired
my
holy
one
was
sick
too
and
did
he
fall
into
yess
i
am
his
good
friend
i
tell
you
he
was
behaving
very
strange
when
i
came
down
after
you
and
i
thought
perhaps
he
might
have
the
papers
i
followed
him
on
his
meditations
and
to
discuss
ethnological
points
also
you
see
i
am
verree
small
person
here
nowadays
in
comparison
with
all
his
charms
by
jove
do
you
know
he
is
afflicted
with
infirmity
of
fits
yess
i
tell
you
cataleptic
too
if
not
also
epileptic
i
found
him
in
such
a
state
under
a
tree
in
articulo
mortem
and
he
jumped
up
and
walked
into
a
brook
and
he
was
nearly
drowned
but
for
me
i
pulled
him
out
i
was
not
there
said
kim
might
have
died
he
might
have
died
but
he
is
dry
now
and
asserts
he
has
undergone
transfiguration
the
babu
tapped
his
forehead
knowingly
took
notes
of
his
statements
for
royal
society
in
posse
you
must
make
haste
and
be
quite
well
and
come
back
to
simla
and
i
will
tell
you
all
my
tale
at
lurgan
it
was
splendid
the
bottoms
of
their
trousers
were
quite
torn
and
old
nahan
rajah
he
thought
they
were
european
soldiers
deserting
the
russians
how
long
were
they
with
thee
was
a
frenchman
oh
days
and
days
and
days
now
all
the
believe
all
russians
are
all
beggars
by
jove
they
had
not
one
that
i
did
not
get
them
and
i
told
the
common
people
oah
such
tales
and
anecdotes
i
will
tell
you
at
old
when
you
come
up
we
will
have
ah
a
night
out
it
is
feather
in
both
our
caps
yess
and
they
gave
me
a
certificate
that
is
creaming
joke
you
should
have
seen
them
at
the
alliance
bank
identifying
themselves
and
thank
almighty
god
you
got
their
papers
so
well
you
do
not
laugh
verree
much
but
you
shall
laugh
when
you
are
well
now
i
will
go
straight
to
the
railway
and
get
out
you
shall
have
all
sorts
of
credits
for
your
game
when
do
you
come
along
we
are
very
proud
of
you
though
you
gave
us
great
frights
and
especially
mahbub
mahbub
and
where
is
he
horses
in
this
of
course
why
speak
slowly
there
is
a
thickness
in
my
head
still
the
babu
looked
shyly
down
his
nose
you
see
i
am
fearful
man
and
i
do
not
like
responsibility
you
were
sick
you
see
and
i
did
not
know
where
the
papers
were
and
if
so
how
many
so
when
i
had
come
down
here
i
slipped
in
private
wire
to
mahbub
he
was
at
meerut
for
races
and
i
tell
him
how
case
stands
he
comes
up
with
his
men
and
he
consorts
with
the
lama
and
then
he
calls
me
a
fool
and
is
very
rude
wherefore
wherefore
is
what
i
ask
i
only
suggest
that
if
anyone
steals
the
papers
i
should
like
some
good
strong
brave
men
to
rob
them
back
again
you
see
they
are
vitally
important
and
mahbub
ali
he
did
not
know
where
you
were
ali
to
rob
the
sahiba
house
thou
art
mad
babu
said
kim
with
indignation
wanted
the
papers
suppose
she
had
stole
them
it
was
only
practical
suggestion
i
think
you
are
not
pleased
eh
a
native
proverb
unquotable
showed
the
blackness
of
kim
disapproval
hurree
shrugged
his
shoulders
is
no
accounting
for
thee
taste
mahbub
was
angry
too
he
has
sold
horses
all
about
here
and
he
says
old
lady
is
pukka
thorough
old
lady
and
would
not
condescend
to
such
ungentlemanly
things
i
do
not
care
i
have
got
the
papers
and
i
was
very
glad
of
moral
support
from
mahbub
i
tell
you
i
am
fearful
man
but
somehow
or
other
the
more
fearful
i
am
the
more
places
i
get
into
so
i
was
glad
you
came
with
me
to
chini
and
i
am
glad
mahbub
was
close
by
the
old
lady
she
is
sometimes
very
rude
to
me
and
my
beautiful
pills
be
merciful
said
kim
on
his
elbow
rejoicing
a
beast
of
wonder
is
a
babu
and
that
man
walked
alone
if
he
did
walk
with
robbed
and
angry
foreigners
thatt
was
nothing
after
they
had
done
beating
me
but
if
i
lost
the
papers
it
was
serious
mahbub
he
nearly
beat
me
too
and
he
went
and
consorted
with
the
lama
no
end
i
shall
stick
to
ethnological
investigations
henceforwards
now
mister
i
can
catch
to
umballa
if
i
am
quick
it
will
be
good
times
when
we
all
tell
thee
tale
up
at
mr
lurgan
i
shall
report
you
offeecially
better
my
dear
fallow
and
when
next
you
are
under
thee
emotions
please
do
not
use
the
mohammedan
terms
with
the
tibetan
dress
he
shook
hands
twice
a
babu
to
his
and
opened
the
door
with
the
fall
of
the
sunlight
upon
his
still
triumphant
face
he
returned
to
the
humble
dacca
quack
robbed
them
thought
kim
forgetting
his
own
share
in
the
game
tricked
them
he
lied
to
them
like
a
bengali
they
give
him
a
chit
a
testimonial
he
makes
them
a
mock
at
the
risk
of
his
life
i
never
would
have
gone
down
to
them
after
the
and
then
he
says
he
is
a
fearful
man
and
he
is
a
fearful
man
i
must
get
into
the
world
again
at
first
his
legs
bent
like
bad
and
the
flood
and
rush
of
the
sunlit
air
dazzled
him
he
squatted
by
the
white
wall
the
mind
rummaging
among
the
incidents
of
the
long
dooli
journey
the
weaknesses
and
now
that
the
stimulus
of
talk
was
removed
his
own
of
which
like
the
sick
he
had
great
store
the
unnerved
brain
edged
away
from
all
the
outside
as
a
raw
horse
once
rowelled
sidles
from
the
spur
it
was
enough
amply
enough
that
the
spoil
of
the
kilta
was
away
off
his
hands
out
of
his
possession
he
tried
to
think
of
the
lama
to
wonder
why
he
had
tumbled
into
a
brook
but
the
bigness
of
the
world
seen
between
the
forecourt
gates
swept
linked
thought
aside
then
he
looked
upon
the
trees
and
the
broad
fields
with
the
thatched
huts
hidden
among
crops
looked
with
strange
eyes
unable
to
take
up
the
size
and
proportion
and
use
of
things
stared
for
a
still
all
that
while
he
felt
though
he
could
not
put
it
into
words
that
his
soul
was
out
of
gear
with
its
surroundings
a
unconnected
with
any
machinery
just
like
the
idle
of
a
cheap
beheea
laid
by
in
a
corner
the
breezes
fanned
over
him
the
parrots
shrieked
at
him
the
noises
of
the
populated
house
behind
squabbles
orders
and
reproofs
hit
on
dead
ears
am
kim
i
am
kim
and
what
is
kim
his
soul
repeated
it
again
and
again
he
did
not
want
to
cry
had
never
felt
less
like
crying
in
his
life
but
of
a
sudden
easy
stupid
tears
trickled
down
his
nose
and
with
an
almost
audible
click
he
felt
the
wheels
of
his
being
lock
up
anew
on
the
world
without
things
that
rode
meaningless
on
the
eyeball
an
instant
before
slid
into
proper
proportion
roads
were
meant
to
be
walked
upon
houses
to
be
lived
in
cattle
to
be
driven
fields
to
be
tilled
and
men
and
women
to
be
talked
to
they
were
all
real
and
true
solidly
planted
upon
the
feet
perfectly
comprehensible
clay
of
his
clay
neither
more
nor
less
he
shook
himself
like
a
dog
with
a
flea
in
his
ear
and
rambled
out
of
the
gate
said
the
sahiba
to
whom
watchful
eyes
reported
this
move
him
go
i
have
done
my
share
mother
earth
must
do
the
rest
when
the
holy
one
comes
back
from
meditation
tell
him
there
stood
an
empty
on
a
little
knoll
half
a
mile
away
with
a
young
banyan
tree
behind
a
as
it
were
above
some
levels
and
his
eyelids
bathed
in
soft
air
grew
heavy
as
he
neared
it
the
ground
was
good
clean
dust
no
new
herbage
that
living
is
to
death
already
but
the
hopeful
dust
that
holds
the
seeds
of
all
life
he
felt
it
between
his
toes
patted
it
with
his
palms
and
joint
by
joint
sighing
luxuriously
laid
him
down
full
length
along
in
the
shadow
of
the
cart
and
mother
earth
was
as
faithful
as
the
sahiba
she
breathed
through
him
to
restore
the
poise
he
had
lost
lying
so
long
on
a
cot
cut
off
from
her
good
currents
his
head
lay
powerless
upon
her
breast
and
his
opened
hands
surrendered
to
her
strength
the
tree
above
him
and
even
the
dead
manhandled
wood
beside
knew
what
he
sought
as
he
himself
did
not
know
hour
upon
hour
he
lay
deeper
than
sleep
towards
evening
when
the
dust
of
returning
kine
made
all
the
horizons
smoke
came
the
lama
and
mahbub
ali
both
afoot
walking
cautiously
for
the
house
had
told
them
where
he
had
gone
what
a
fool
trick
to
play
in
open
country
muttered
the
could
be
shot
a
hundred
times
but
this
is
not
the
border
said
the
lama
repeating
a
tale
was
such
a
chela
temperate
kindly
wise
of
ungrudging
disposition
a
merry
heart
upon
the
road
never
forgetting
learned
truthful
courteous
great
is
his
reward
know
the
boy
as
i
have
said
he
was
all
those
things
of
them
but
i
have
not
yet
found
a
red
hat
charm
for
making
him
overly
truthful
he
has
certainly
been
well
nursed
sahiba
is
a
heart
of
gold
said
the
lama
earnestly
looks
upon
him
as
her
son
half
hind
seems
that
way
disposed
i
only
wished
to
see
that
the
boy
had
come
to
no
harm
and
was
a
free
agent
as
thou
knowest
he
and
i
were
old
friends
in
the
first
days
of
your
pilgrimage
together
is
a
bond
between
us
the
lama
sat
down
are
at
the
end
of
the
pilgrimage
thanks
to
thee
thine
was
not
cut
off
for
good
and
all
a
week
back
i
heard
what
the
sahiba
said
to
thee
when
we
bore
thee
up
on
the
cot
mahbub
laughed
and
tugged
his
newly
dyed
beard
was
meditating
upon
other
matters
that
tide
it
was
the
hakim
from
dacca
broke
my
meditations
this
was
in
pushtu
for
decency
sake
wouldst
have
ended
thy
meditations
upon
the
sultry
side
of
hell
being
an
unbeliever
and
an
idolater
for
all
thy
child
simplicity
but
now
red
hat
what
is
to
be
done
very
night
the
words
came
slowly
vibrating
with
triumph
very
night
he
will
be
as
free
as
i
am
from
all
taint
of
sin
assured
as
i
am
when
he
quits
this
body
of
freedom
from
the
wheel
of
things
i
have
a
sign
he
laid
his
hand
above
the
torn
chart
in
his
bosom
my
time
is
short
but
i
shall
have
safeguarded
him
throughout
the
years
remember
i
have
reached
knowledge
as
i
told
thee
only
three
nights
back
must
be
true
as
the
tirah
priest
said
when
i
stole
his
wife
that
i
am
a
sufi
a
for
here
i
sit
said
mahbub
to
himself
in
blasphemy
unthinkable
i
remember
the
tale
on
that
then
he
goes
to
fannatu
the
gardens
of
eden
but
how
wilt
thou
slay
him
or
drown
him
in
that
wonderful
river
from
which
the
babu
dragged
thee
was
dragged
from
no
river
said
the
lama
simply
hast
forgotten
what
befell
i
found
it
by
knowledge
ay
true
stammered
mahbub
divided
between
high
indignation
and
enormous
mirth
had
forgotten
the
exact
run
of
what
happened
thou
didst
find
it
knowingly
to
say
that
i
would
take
life
is
not
a
sin
but
a
madness
simple
my
chela
aided
me
to
the
river
it
is
his
right
to
be
cleansed
from
sin
with
me
he
needs
cleansing
but
afterwards
old
man
afterwards
matter
under
all
the
heavens
he
is
sure
of
nibban
enlightened
as
i
am
said
i
had
a
fear
he
might
mount
mohammed
horse
and
fly
away
he
must
go
forth
as
a
teacher
now
i
see
that
is
the
right
gait
for
the
colt
certainly
he
must
go
forth
as
a
teacher
he
is
somewhat
urgently
needed
as
a
scribe
by
the
state
for
instance
that
end
he
was
prepared
i
acquired
merit
in
that
i
gave
alms
for
his
sake
a
good
deed
does
not
die
he
aided
me
in
my
search
i
aided
him
in
his
just
is
the
wheel
o
from
the
north
let
him
be
a
teacher
let
him
be
a
scribe
what
matter
he
will
have
attained
freedom
at
the
end
the
rest
is
illusion
matter
when
i
must
have
him
with
me
beyond
balkh
in
six
months
i
come
up
with
ten
lame
horses
and
three
men
thanks
to
that
chicken
of
a
babu
to
break
a
sick
boy
by
force
out
of
an
old
trot
house
it
seems
that
i
stand
by
while
a
young
sahib
is
hoisted
into
allah
knows
what
of
an
idolater
heaven
by
means
of
old
red
hat
and
i
am
reckoned
something
of
a
player
of
the
game
myself
but
the
madman
is
fond
of
the
boy
and
i
must
be
very
reasonably
mad
too
is
the
prayer
said
the
lama
as
the
rough
pushtu
rumbled
into
the
red
beard
matter
at
all
but
now
i
understand
that
the
boy
sure
of
paradise
can
yet
enter
government
service
my
mind
is
easier
i
must
get
to
my
horses
it
grows
dark
do
not
wake
him
i
have
no
wish
to
hear
him
call
thee
master
he
is
my
disciple
what
else
has
told
me
mahbub
choked
down
his
touch
of
spleen
and
rose
laughing
am
not
altogether
of
thy
faith
red
hat
if
so
small
a
matter
concern
thee
is
nothing
said
the
lama
thought
not
therefore
it
will
not
move
thee
sinless
and
three
parts
drowned
to
boot
when
i
call
thee
a
good
man
a
very
good
man
we
have
talked
together
some
four
or
five
evenings
now
and
for
all
i
am
a
i
can
still
as
the
saying
is
see
holiness
beyond
the
legs
of
a
horse
yea
can
see
too
how
our
friend
of
all
the
world
put
his
hand
in
thine
at
the
first
use
him
well
and
suffer
him
to
return
to
the
world
as
a
teacher
when
thou
hast
bathed
his
legs
if
that
be
the
proper
medicine
for
the
colt
not
follow
the
way
thyself
and
so
accompany
the
boy
mahbub
stared
stupefied
at
the
magnificent
insolence
of
the
demand
which
across
the
border
he
would
have
paid
with
more
than
a
blow
then
the
humour
of
it
touched
his
worldly
soul
softly
one
foot
at
a
time
as
the
lame
gelding
went
over
the
umballa
jumps
i
may
come
to
paradise
later
i
have
workings
that
way
great
motions
and
i
owe
them
to
thy
simplicity
thou
hast
never
lied
need
allah
hear
him
what
need
in
this
thy
world
nor
ever
harmed
a
man
with
a
pencase
before
i
was
wise
i
think
the
better
of
thee
thy
teachings
are
good
thou
hast
turned
one
man
that
i
know
from
the
path
of
strife
he
laughed
immensely
came
here
to
commit
a
dacoity
a
with
violence
yes
to
cut
rob
kill
and
carry
off
what
he
desired
great
foolishness
black
shame
too
so
he
thought
after
he
had
seen
thee
and
a
few
others
male
and
female
so
he
abandoned
it
and
now
he
goes
to
beat
a
big
fat
babu
man
do
not
understand
forbid
it
some
men
are
strong
in
knowledge
red
hat
thy
strength
is
stronger
still
keep
it
i
think
thou
wilt
if
the
boy
be
not
a
good
servant
pull
his
ears
off
with
a
hitch
of
his
broad
bokhariot
belt
the
pathan
swaggered
off
into
the
gloaming
and
the
lama
came
down
from
his
clouds
so
far
as
to
look
at
the
broad
back
person
lacks
courtesy
and
is
deceived
by
the
shadow
of
appearances
but
he
spoke
well
of
my
chela
who
now
enters
upon
his
reward
let
me
make
the
prayer
wake
o
fortunate
above
all
born
of
women
wake
it
is
found
kim
came
up
from
those
deep
wells
and
the
lama
attended
his
yawning
pleasure
duly
snapping
fingers
to
head
off
evil
spirits
have
slept
a
hundred
years
where
holy
one
hast
thou
been
here
long
i
went
out
to
look
for
thee
but
he
laughed
drowsily
slept
by
the
way
i
am
all
well
now
hast
thou
eaten
let
us
go
to
the
house
it
is
many
days
since
i
tended
thee
and
the
sahiba
fed
thee
well
who
shampooed
thy
legs
what
of
the
weaknesses
the
belly
and
the
neck
and
the
beating
in
the
ears
all
gone
dost
thou
not
know
know
nothing
but
that
i
have
not
seen
thee
in
a
monkey
age
know
what
the
knowledge
did
not
reach
out
to
thee
when
all
my
thoughts
were
theeward
can
not
see
the
face
but
the
voice
is
like
a
gong
has
the
sahiba
made
a
young
man
of
thee
by
her
cookery
he
peered
at
the
figure
outlined
against
the
drift
of
light
so
does
the
stone
bodhisat
sit
who
looks
down
upon
the
patent
turnstiles
of
the
lahore
museum
the
lama
held
his
peace
except
for
the
click
of
the
rosary
and
a
faint
of
mahbub
retreating
feet
the
soft
smoky
silence
of
evening
in
india
wrapped
them
close
me
i
bring
news
let
us
out
shot
the
long
yellow
hand
compelling
silence
kim
tucked
his
feet
under
his
obediently
me
i
bring
news
the
search
is
finished
comes
now
the
reward
thus
when
we
were
among
the
hills
i
lived
on
thy
strength
till
the
young
branch
bowed
and
nigh
broke
when
we
came
out
of
the
hills
i
was
troubled
for
thee
and
for
other
matters
which
i
held
in
my
heart
the
boat
of
my
soul
lacked
direction
i
could
not
see
into
the
cause
of
things
so
i
gave
thee
over
to
the
virtuous
woman
altogether
i
took
no
food
i
drank
no
water
still
i
saw
not
the
way
they
pressed
food
upon
me
and
cried
at
my
shut
door
so
i
removed
myself
to
a
hollow
under
a
tree
i
took
no
food
i
took
no
water
i
sat
in
meditation
two
days
and
two
nights
abstracting
my
mind
inbreathing
and
outbreathing
in
the
required
manner
upon
the
second
night
so
great
was
my
reward
the
wise
soul
loosed
itself
from
the
silly
body
and
went
free
this
i
have
never
before
attained
though
i
have
stood
on
the
threshold
of
it
consider
for
it
is
a
marvel
marvel
indeed
two
days
and
two
nights
without
food
where
was
the
sahiba
said
kim
under
his
breath
my
soul
went
free
and
wheeling
like
an
eagle
saw
indeed
that
there
was
no
teshoo
lama
nor
any
other
soul
as
a
drop
draws
to
water
so
my
soul
drew
near
to
the
great
soul
which
is
beyond
all
things
at
that
point
exalted
in
contemplation
i
saw
all
hind
from
ceylon
in
the
sea
to
the
hills
and
my
own
painted
rocks
at
i
saw
every
camp
and
village
to
the
least
where
we
have
ever
rested
i
saw
them
at
one
time
and
in
one
place
for
they
were
within
the
soul
by
this
i
knew
the
soul
had
passed
beyond
the
illusion
of
time
and
space
and
of
things
by
this
i
knew
that
i
was
free
i
saw
thee
lying
in
thy
cot
and
i
saw
thee
falling
downhill
under
the
idolater
at
one
time
in
one
place
in
my
soul
which
as
i
say
had
touched
the
great
soul
also
i
saw
the
stupid
body
of
teshoo
lama
lying
down
and
the
hakim
from
dacca
kneeled
beside
shouting
in
its
ear
then
my
soul
was
all
alone
and
i
saw
nothing
for
i
was
all
things
having
reached
the
great
soul
and
i
meditated
a
thousand
thousand
years
passionless
well
aware
of
the
causes
of
all
things
then
a
voice
cried
what
shall
come
to
the
boy
if
thou
art
dead
and
i
was
shaken
back
and
forth
in
myself
with
pity
for
thee
and
i
said
i
will
return
to
my
chela
lest
he
miss
the
way
upon
this
my
soul
which
is
the
soul
of
teshoo
lama
withdrew
itself
from
the
great
soul
with
strivings
and
yearnings
and
retchings
and
agonies
not
to
be
told
as
the
egg
from
the
fish
as
the
fish
from
the
water
as
the
water
from
the
cloud
as
the
cloud
from
the
thick
air
so
put
forth
so
leaped
out
so
drew
away
so
fumed
up
the
soul
of
teshoo
lama
from
the
great
soul
then
a
voice
cried
the
river
take
heed
to
the
river
and
i
looked
down
upon
all
the
world
which
was
as
i
had
seen
it
before
one
in
time
one
in
place
and
i
saw
plainly
the
river
of
the
arrow
at
my
feet
at
that
hour
my
soul
was
hampered
by
some
evil
or
other
whereof
i
was
not
wholly
cleansed
and
it
lay
upon
my
arms
and
coiled
round
my
waist
but
i
put
it
aside
and
i
cast
forth
as
an
eagle
in
my
flight
for
the
very
place
of
the
river
i
pushed
aside
world
upon
world
for
thy
sake
i
saw
the
river
below
me
the
river
of
the
arrow
and
descending
the
waters
of
it
closed
over
me
and
behold
i
was
again
in
the
body
of
teshoo
lama
but
free
from
sin
and
the
hakim
from
decca
bore
up
my
head
in
the
waters
of
the
river
it
is
here
it
is
behind
the
here
even
here
kerim
oh
well
that
the
babu
was
by
wast
thou
very
wet
should
i
regard
i
remember
the
hakim
was
concerned
for
the
body
of
teshoo
lama
he
haled
it
out
of
the
holy
water
in
his
hands
and
there
came
afterwards
thy
from
the
north
with
a
cot
and
men
and
they
put
the
body
on
the
cot
and
bore
it
up
to
the
house
said
the
sahiba
was
meditating
in
that
body
and
did
not
hear
so
thus
the
search
is
ended
for
the
merit
that
i
have
acquired
the
river
of
the
arrow
is
here
it
broke
forth
at
our
feet
as
i
have
said
i
have
found
it
son
of
my
soul
i
have
wrenched
my
soul
back
from
the
threshold
of
freedom
to
free
thee
from
all
sin
as
i
am
free
and
sinless
just
is
the
wheel
certain
is
our
deliverance
come
he
crossed
his
hands
on
his
lap
and
smiled
as
a
man
may
who
has
won
salvation
for
himself
and
his
beloved
