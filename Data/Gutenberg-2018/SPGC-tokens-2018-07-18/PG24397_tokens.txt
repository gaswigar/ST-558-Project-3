may
extensive

any

that
the
copyright
on
this
publication
was

was
a
young
enthusiastic
worker
for
the
welfare
department
she
liked
helping
people
only
she
helped
them
the
office
was
very
bright
or
sunny
but
that
did
matter
in
the
first
place
if
gloria
really
wanted
sun
she
could
always
get
some
by
tuning
in
on
a
mind
outside
someone
walking
the
streets
of
downtown
new
york
and
in
the
second
place
the
weather
was
important
what
mattered
was
how
you
felt
inside
gloria
took
off
her
beret
and
crammed
it
into
a
drawer
of
her
desk
she
sat
down
feeling
perfectly
ready
for
work
her
bright
eyes
sparkling
and
her
whole
body
eager
for
the
demands
of
the
day
it
was
ten
minutes
to
nine
in
the
morning
on
the
desk
was
a
mass
of
reports
and
folders
gloria
looked
at
them
and
sighed
the
cleaning
woman
she
thought
must
have
upset
everything
again
but
neatness
was
the
keystone
of
good
efficient
work
in
any
field
gloria
set
to
work
rearranging
everything
in
a
proper
order
the
job
took
her
nearly
twenty
minutes
and
by
the
time
she
was
finished
the
office
was
full
fredericksohn
had
arrived
yet
naturally
he
always
came
in
around
but
all
of
the
case
workers
were
ready
for
the
work
gloria
looked
around
the
office
at
them
beaming
it
was
good
to
be
able
to
help
people
and
to
know
that
what
you
were
doing
was
right
she
remembered
wondering
how
you
could
be
sure
you
were
right
about
somebody
else
if
you
could
read
minds
but
then
there
were
rules
to
go
by
and
all
of
the
fine
classes
and
textbooks
that
a
social
case
worker
had
to
have
if
you
paid
attention
and
if
you
really
wanted
to
help
people
gloria
supposed
it
was
all
right
certainly
everything
in
her
own
office
seemed
to
run
smoothly
not
that
she
would
ever
do
anything
about
another
worker
no
matter
what
gloria
remembered
what
greystone
a
teacher
of
hers
had
said
a
year
or
so
before
never
interfere
with
the
case
load
of
another
worker
your
sole
job
is
represented
by
your
own
case
load
that
was
good
advice
gloria
thought
and
anyhow
her
assistance
seem
to
be
too
badly
needed
among
the
others
she
had
quite
enough
to
do
in
taking
care
of
her
own
clients
and
here
she
was
wasting
time
she
shook
her
head
and
breathed
a
little
sigh
and
began
on
the
first
folder
name
gironde
jose
wladek
marie
she
was
no
fool
she
knew
about
the
reports
they
had
to
make
and
the
sheets
covered
with
all
the
details
of
your
very
own
private
life
she
had
seen
them
on
a
desk
when
she
had
come
to
keep
her
appointment
wladek
was
her
name
and
that
was
how
the
report
would
look
with
her
name
all
reversed
in
order
right
on
the
top
and
underneath
that
there
would
be
her
address
and
her
story
all
that
she
had
told
the
case
workers
set
right
down
in
black
and
white
for
anybody
at
all
to
read
when
you
were
poor
you
had
no
privacy
and
that
was
the
truth
wladek
shook
her
head
a
poor
old
woman
that
was
all
that
she
was
and
privacy
was
a
luxury
not
to
be
asked
for
who
said
the
united
states
was
different
from
the
old
country
she
thought
in
the
old
country
one
still
heard
the
old
stories
the
streets
paved
with
gold
and
the
food
waiting
for
such
as
yourself
oh
the
war
had
not
changed
that
in
the
least
now
the
voice
of
america
was
heard
in
the
old
country
she
had
a
letter
smuggled
out
from
her
own
marfa
telling
her
all
about
the
voice
of
america
and
that
was
only
another
trap
they
wanted
to
make
you
leave
your
own
land
and
your
own
country
and
come
far
away
to
america
and
to
the
united
states
so
that
you
would
have
no
friends
and
you
would
be
defenseless
then
you
could
not
help
yourself
then
you
had
to
do
what
they
asked
you
because
there
was
no
other
way
to
eat
there
were
no
friends
to
feed
you
dinners
or
to
allow
you
room
in
a
good
house
no
there
was
only
the
case
worker
with
her
reports
that
took
the
last
bit
of
privacy
away
from
an
old
woman
and
left
her
with
barely
enough
money
to
remain
alive
get
a
job
they
said
tell
your
son
to
get
a
job
he
is
young
and
strong
and
healthy
certainly
but
the
united
states
is
not
a
place
in
which
to
work
the
united
states
will
give
you
money
this
fact
she
had
from
her
uncle
bedrich
who
had
come
to
the
new
country
years
before
and
who
had
written
many
letters
back
to
his
family
before
his
death
in
an
accident
should
she
then
work
should
her
own
son
her
own
rudi
be
forced
to
work
out
his
time
of
youth
surely
a
little
privacy
was
a
small
enough
thing
to
surrender
for
freedom
and
ease
but
that
they
should
ask
for
you
to
surrender
it
wladek
stood
up
carefully
her
old
bones
creaked
and
she
could
feel
them
creaking
she
looked
around
the
tiny
living
room
covered
with
dust
one
should
have
the
money
to
hire
a
maid
but
the
case
workers
had
never
understood
that
young
things
of
course
they
knew
nothing
of
the
troubles
facing
an
old
woman
an
old
woman
needed
a
maid
she
laughed
briefly
to
herself
at
the
idea
and
realized
at
the
same
time
that
she
had
been
hiding
her
own
thoughts
from
herself
today
was
her
appointment
day
and
the
new
one
would
be
there
blond
and
young
and
smiling
at
her
with
the
innocent
face
there
was
something
wrong
with
the
new
one
she
could
see
that
in
the
old
country
there
were
stories
you
marie
wladek
afraid
of
a
young
woman
does
your
age
count
for
nothing
does
your
experience
and
knowledge
count
for
nothing
and
yet
she
had
to
admit
to
herself
that
she
was
afraid
and
that
she
was
afraid
of
giving
a
name
to
her
fear
only
a
fool
could
mock
at
the
stories
told
in
the
old
country
and
wladek
knew
of
such
a
fool
he
had
died
with
mockery
on
his
lips
but
all
had
known
what
had
killed
him
you
not
battle
a
young
woman
and
win
marie
wladek
and
yet
the
young
woman
had
something
strange
about
her
and
wladek
remembered
the
old
stories
and
thought
of
witchcraft
who
could
fight
witchcraft
even
when
the
witch
was
a
young
girl
without
experience
and
with
an
innocent
face
and
blond
hair
wladek
looked
at
the
mantel
clock
she
had
brought
with
her
across
the
ocean
it
told
perfect
time
it
was
as
good
as
everything
from
the
old
country
here
in
america
they
had
no
such
clocks
here
everything
ran
by
electricity
and
when
you
touched
it
there
was
a
shock
which
was
unnatural
the
old
clock
told
the
time
appointment
hour
was
approaching
wladek
did
not
want
to
leave
the
house
she
did
not
want
to
face
this
new
case
worker
but
all
the
same
one
had
to
have
money
to
live
that
they
should
force
an
old
woman
to
travel
across
the
city
and
to
speak
with
a
girl
by
appointment
solely
in
order
to
get
the
money
which
should
have
been
hers

examination
needed
is
back
injury
chronic
there
was
a
great
deal
of
paper
work
needed
gloria
realized
at
first
she
had
liked
the
paper
work
at
all
but
she
could
see
now
how
necessary
it
was
after
all
everybody
was
like
her
the
other
workers
she
knew
did
have
her
particular
talent
and
they
had
to
write
things
down
for
fear
they
forget
sometimes
gloria
felt
very
sorry
for
the
other
case
workers
but
she
knew
they
were
doing
their
very
best
and
they
were
after
all
helping
people
that
was
the
only
important
thing
to
help
people
to
make
them
better
members
of
society
now
jose
gironde
back
injury
was
certainly
chronic
gloria
tried
to
remember
the
medical
term
for
it
it
was
something
to
do
with
a
lordosis
she
paid
no
attention
to
that
since
she
had
been
trying
to
fix
up
the
back
instead
but
now
a
doctor
had
to
be
called
and
a
thorough
examination
had
to
be
given
all
so
that
the
records
would
show
what
gloria
knew
already
a
case
worker
could
fill
out
a
medical
report
you
had
to
be
a
doctor
to
do
that
and
it
did
matter
gloria
knew
if
you
had
all
the
information
at
your
fingertips
and
even
knew
more
than
the
doctor
gloria
could
have
cured
jose
gironde
back
easily
a
doctor
could
do
that
examination
was
the
doctor
job
it
was
like
being
a
member
of
a
team
gloria
thought
that
felt
good
she
got
out
the
list
of
doctors
which
all
the
case
workers
used
and
followed
it
down
with
her
finger
willmarth
was
free
she
knew
on
thursday
morning
at
eleven
luckily
jose
gironde
was
free
at
the
same
hour
she
made
a
note
to
call
the
doctor
and
make
an
appointment
and
to
clear
the
appointment
with
jose
gironde
and
made
a
duplicate
note
on
the
report
sheet
that
would
take
care
of
that
the
paper
work
after
all
was
so
very
hard
all
she
had
to
do
now
was
to
make
the
actual
calls
and
then
wait
for
the
written
result
of
the
examination
when
that
had
come
through
she
would
be
able
to
recommend
jose
gironde
for
permanent
relief
as
was
obviously
indicated
in
his
case
the
back
injury
could
not
be
corrected
by
medical
science
and
if
gloria
were
to
correct
it
your
job
as
a
case
worker
is
clearly
defined
a
teacher
had
said
meddling
in
another
province
without
the
permission
of
your
supervisor
is
always
in
other
words
gloria
thought
the
has
to
be
kept
and
that
too
made
sense
when
you
thought
about
it
she
looked
up
to
see
harold
meedy
smiling
across
the
room
at
her
she
smiled
back
very
briefly
and
went
back
to
her
own
work
interpersonal
relationships
within
the
office
framework
a
teacher
mr
greystone
had
said
are
fraught
with
danger
and
should
be
handled
with
the
greatest
care
if
harold
meedy
wanted
to
get
acquainted
with
her
that
was
his
affair
she
did
feel
that
she
could
conscientiously
encourage
him
in
the
slightest
not
only
was
he
a
fellow
worker
which
made
the
whole
situation
more
complicated
than
it
would
ordinarily
have
been
but
he
was
a
small
pudgy
man
with
pimples
and
an
earnest
expression
he
looked
as
if
he
would
be
a
bore
and
a
difficult
person
to
get
rid
of
he
was
gloria
just
did
think
he
was
exactly
her
type
and
if
he
went
on
trying
she
thought
regretfully
she
would
be
forced
to
do
something
about
it
of
course
meedy
would
never
know
the
difference
but
even
so
gloria
did
like
to
do
any
unnecessary
work
changing
someone
mind
was
a
delicate
job
and
a
responsible
one
not
to
be
undertaken
for
a
small
motive
even
if
the
person
never
knew
his
mind
had
been
changed
at
all
wladek
in
her
apartment
shrugged
on
an
old
coat
and
compressed
her
lips
with
weariness
appointment
time
was
near
and
a
person
had
to
be
punctual
even
when
a
person
was
going
to
see
a
young
girl
who
was
strange
and
frightening
and
who
might
do
do
be
a
foolish
old
wladek
told
herself
rudi
would
have
told
her
that
but
rudi
was
out
somewhere
with
a
girl
or
with
some
of
his
friends
like
a
good
american
boy
do
be
a
foolish
old
woman
rudi
would
have
said
but
wladek
was
frightened
it
was
nearly
ten
gloria
noticed
she
did
not
feel
in
the
least
tired
she
was
still
eager
and
ready
for
work
she
decided
she
had
time
for
one
more
folder
before
the
first
of
her
appointments
arrived
she
reached
out
for
it
and
saw
fredericksohn
coming
in
the
door
he
smiled
at
her
a
tall
man
with
a
square
face
who
radiated
enormous
efficiency
and
a
certain
distant
friendliness
she
did
not
say
hello
but
merely
nodded
fredericksohn
liked
to
take
the
initiative
himself
in
all
relationships
how
are
we
doing
today
he
said
peering
over
her
shoulder
fine
she
said
happily
just
fine
fredericksohn
grunted
i
see
wladek
on
your
schedule
today
that
right
she
said
just
do
what
you
can
he
said
you
seen
her
before
have
you
she
nodded
once
last
week
she
a
problem
he
said
fredericksohn
was
always
a
little
chary
of
saying
anything
that
might
be
construed
as
derogatory
to
a
client
even
in
the
privacy
of
professional
conversation
i
sure
we
be
able
to
work
things
out
gloria
said
well
fredericksohn
said
and
paused
then
he
nodded
you
do
what
you
can
he
said
his
voice
sounded
doubtful
she
beamed
up
at
him
i
certainly
will
she
said
with
enthusiasm
fredericksohn
nodded
and
muttered
something
and
went
on
by
gloria
smiled
oh
she
was
going
to
show
fredericksohn
all
right
he
just
was
sure
she
could
handle
wladek
and
the
old
woman
certainly
did
represent
a
problem
her
folder
was
full
of
notations
by
case
worker
after
case
worker
but
gloria
smile
broadened
just
a
trifle
my
goodness
everything
was
going
to
be
all
right
she
was
sure
fredericksohn
would
be
happy
with
her
work
though
the
important
thing
was
her
own
success
but
the
people
themselves
if
you
could
help
them
to
be
bright
and
happy
and
successful
then
that
was
the
best
job
in
the
world
and
she
could
my
goodness
yes
wladek
looked
at
the
door
for
a
long
time
without
opening
it
she
did
want
to
go
in
certainly
not
but
there
was
her
appointment
and
money
was
needed
she
had
no
choice
the
cossacks
of
america
had
forced
her
to
this
pass
and
she
was
an
old
woman
what
could
she
do
fight
them
one
had
to
give
in
she
reached
for
the
doorknob
and
turned
it
and
opened
the
door
there
were
all
the
desks
and
the
men
and
women
working
and
near
the
far
corner
on
the
left
the
girl
sat
studying
a
sheet
of
paper
wladek
looked
at
the
blond
hair
and
the
pretty
face
and
the
slight
figure
and
shivered
but
she
had
no
choice
she
went
across
the
room
and
when
she
had
almost
reached
the
desk
the
girl
said
good
morning
mrs
wladek
how
had
she
known
wladek
had
made
no
sound
in
walking
to
the
desk
yet
the
girl
had
known
someone
was
there
and
who
that
someone
was
before
her
head
had
been
raised
truly
the
girl
was
frightening
wladek
eased
herself
feeling
her
bones
creak
into
a
chair
at
the
side
of
the
desk
she
said
nothing
how
are
things
going
the
girl
said
in
her
pleasant
smooth
voice
i
am
fine
wladek
said
deliberately
she
did
not
inquire
about
the
girl
health
that
would
show
her
that
impoliteness
would
show
her
what
an
old
woman
thought
of
her
that
good
the
girl
said
that
very
good
and
how
is
rudi
rudi
is
my
son
wladek
said
i
know
that
the
girl
said
and
smiled
we
met
last
week
do
you
remember
i
remember
you
wladek
said
then
grudgingly
she
added
rudi
is
the
same
he
is
fine
that
fine
the
girl
said
and
has
he
found
a
job
yet
here
it
was
necessary
to
lie
wladek
knew
one
could
not
say
that
rudi
did
not
look
for
work
one
had
to
say
work
is
difficult
to
find
he
tries
but
there
is
no
job
and
how
about
yourself
the
girl
said
i
am
an
old
woman
wladek
said
who
would
hire
an
old
woman
the
girl
nodded
it
been
a
long
time
since
your
husband
died
she
said
in
an
accident
with
an
automobile
wladek
said
i
remember
that
time
it
is
sad
to
think
of
and
rudi
has
found
any
work
in
all
that
time
the
girl
said
he
looks
hard
wladek
said
earnestly
this
was
a
game
that
had
to
be
played
she
knew
a
conversation
that
started
and
finished
each
time
she
came
for
an
appointment
he
looks
but
work
is
difficult
to
find
she
said
i
understand
the
girl
said
but
i
sure
you
and
rudi
will
both
find
work
soon
she
paused
and
her
eyes
closed
wladek
felt
something
happen
it
was
she
felt
a
stirring
a
changing
she
stood
up
suddenly
and
the
chair
clattered
balanced
and
rocked
back
upright
what
are
you
doing
doing
the
girl
said
i
go
to
look
for
work
wladek
said
you
make
me
want
to
look
for
work
that
fine
wladek
the
girl
said
that
just
fine
but
i
want
to
look
for
work
wladek
said
horrified
what
do
you
do
to
me
the
girl
only
smiled
wladek
spun
and
ran
for
the
door
her
eyes
wide
but
she
collided
with
a
desk
and
backed
off
and
then
managed
to
find
her
way
the
door
banged
behind
her
gloria
sat
at
her
desk
smiling
filled
with
satisfaction
of
course
a
reaction
like
wladek
was
only
to
be
expected
but
when
it
was
over
she
would
be
looking
for
work
gloria
released
the
little
doll
she
had
held
throughout
the
interview
and
let
it
fall
back
out
of
sight
into
her
desk
drawer
the
doll
was
shaped
into
a
vague
female
likeness
she
did
need
it
now
her
work
was
done
wladek
was
going
to
look
for
work
and
that
would
adjust
her
to
the
world
she
would
be
a
functioning
member
of
society
now
and
it
would
do
her
a
lot
of
good
rudi
too
gloria
considered
rudi
there
was
another
doll
in
the
drawer
a
male
and
after
a
few
seconds
she
put
her
hand
in
the
drawer
and
fished
around
until
she
had
found
it
she
turned
it
slowly
feeling
for
the
son
until
at
last
she
had
made
contact
there
he
was
talking
with
some
friends
it
would
not
be
hard
she
concentrated
and
at
the
same
time
she
heard
him
talking
so
look
here
the
way
i
see
it
we
got
the
cobras
on
our
necks
we
got
to
get
rid
of
them
right
someone
said
right
rudi
so
if
we
start
a
little
rumble
very
quiet
so
the
cops
do
figure
what
going
on
then
we
a
silence
someone
said
what
wrong
rudi
i
do
know
something
what
am
i
doing
just
standing
here
and
someone
said
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
i
ought
to
be
out
getting
a
job
man
earning
some
bread
for
the
old
lady
got
to
have
money
got
to
have
a
job
someone
said
hey
rudi
wait
what
the
hurry
and
rudi
had
gone
gloria
dropped
the
doll
and
closed
the
drawer
and
sat
back
smiling
gently
it
was
wonderful
to
be
able
to
help
people
it
was
just
wonderful
work
find
a
to
the
employment
looking
for
work
right
a
will
be
nice
to
have
a
steady
somehow
wladek
fought
off
the
voices
in
her
mind
it
was
so
easy
to
succumb
to
them
and
to
drift
into
the
terrible
things
they
wanted
wladek
did
not
want
them
at
all
a
job
indeed
but
it
took
effort
all
the
same
to
concentrate
on
herself
instead
of
the
work
the
job
the
employment
agency
it
took
effort
to
sit
down
on
a
bench
in
the
park
near
the
building
where
the
case
workers
were
and
plan
out
the
next
step
a
witch
certainly
the
girl
was
a
witch
and
she
had
put
a
hex
on
wladek
and
that
hex
had
to
be
removed
how
wladek
thought
first
of
the
old
woman
in
the
store
certainly
a
gypsy
woman
would
be
able
to
take
off
a
hex
wladek
remembered
gypsies
from
the
old
country
laughing
people
with
the
strange
gift
witches
themselves
but
always
available
for
a
price
the
gypsy
woman
wladek
stood
up
and
began
to
walk
toward
the
park
exit
she
forced
her
legs
to
move
creaking
one
step
at
a
time
thinking
to
herself
gypsy
woman
the
gypsy
woman
the
gypsy
and
trying
to
ignore
the
voices
in
her
head
that
went
on
and
on
would
be
good
to
find
a
right
away
to
the
employment
away
there
were
those
who
laughed
marya
proderenska
thought
and
there
would
always
be
those
who
laughed
but
that
did
not
injure
her
for
scoffers
she
felt
only
a
vast
contempt
had
she
not
been
shown
in
a
dream
that
the
power
was
hers
had
not
each
of
her
husbands
even
the
third
who
had
contracted
the
fever
and
died
with
great
suddenness
in
three
weeks
admitted
to
her
that
she
had
a
power
beyond
that
of
any
normal
woman
it
was
the
power
of
vision
and
movement
the
power
of
spell
and
incantation
the
others
called
it
magic
though
no
gypsy
would
call
it
so
marya
proderenska
sat
quietly
in
the
back
room
of
the
little
shop
and
waited
a
woman
would
come
she
knew
that
and
the
knowledge
was
another
piece
of
her
power
and
a
proof
of
it
farther
she
could
not
see
but
in
the
cloud
of
the
future
the
woman
was
clear
what
power
marya
proderenska
had
a
blond
social
worker
had
too
and
other
people
she
had
never
been
able
to
clear
her
mind
of
her
own
superstitions
enough
to
train
the
power
or
work
very
effectively
with
it
the
power
was
sufficient
for
her
marya
proderenska
sighed
the
power
demanded
its
own
responsibilities
she
could
not
marry
outside
the
clan
into
which
she
had
been
born
she
could
not
be
seen
on
certain
days
of
every
month
during
those
days
many
foods
were
forbidden
her
thus
the
power
worked
and
thus
she
lived
the
woman
would
bring
money
for
her
marya
knew
so
she
sat
in
the
back
of
the
shop
and
waited
and
sighed
until
the
front
door
sighed
open
and
marie
wladek
called
old
woman
old
woman
do
you
call
me
marya
said
in
her
proud
baritone
i
call
you
i
call
the
gypsy
woman
marya
stood
up
and
smoothed
her
old
dress
over
the
frame
all
of
her
husbands
had
admired
then
come
to
me
she
called
marie
wladek
crept
into
the
room
her
eyes
saucers
of
awe
to
speak
of
witches
was
all
very
well
and
a
girl
could
give
one
fright
but
here
was
the
authority
and
power
of
witchcraft
in
this
woman
with
the
fuzz
of
hair
on
her
lip
and
the
great
trumpeting
voice
i
come
for
help
wladek
said
i
know
why
you
have
come
marya
proderenska
said
you
have
a
great
trouble
wladek
nodded
i
am
bewitched
a
witch
has
placed
a
hex
upon
me
and
i
come
to
you
to
remove
it
there
was
a
little
silence
then
marya
proderenska
said
the
powers
will
not
do
work
without
payment
wladek
dug
into
her
ancient
beaded
purse
and
found
a
crumpled
dollar
bill
she
handed
it
over
and
the
gypsy
woman
smiled
and
ducked
her
head
it
is
enough
she
said
wladek
said
then
you
will
help
me
i
will
help
you
the
gypsy
woman
said
tell
me
of
this
curse
upon
you
there
is
a
voice
in
my
mind
wladek
said
the
voice
tells
me
even
now
it
continues
to
go
to
an
employment
agency
to
accept
work
and
the
voice
is
not
of
my
making
whose
voice
is
this
the
gypsy
woman
said
it
is
my
own
voice
wladek
said
the
voice
is
my
own
but
i
did
not
tell
it
to
speak
inside
my
own
head
i
can
hear
my
own
voice
as
if
someone
else
put
it
there
ah
the
gypsy
woman
said
and
who
is
the
witch
who
has
put
this
curse
upon
you
wladek
sighed
at
the
office
of
the
social
workers
there
is
one
a
young
woman
she
has
done
this
to
me
marya
proderenska
nodded
her
eyes
closed
wladek
stared
at
the
still
figure
without
moving
for
a
minute
time
stretched
endlessly
the
room
was
very
quiet
wladek
heard
the
continuing
voice
in
her
mind
and
felt
fear
another
minute
ticked
by
at
last
the
gypsy
woman
opened
her
eyes
it
is
a
strong
curse
she
said
in
a
distant
voice
but
i
have
erased
it
for
you
i
have
taken
the
hex
from
you
is
it
not
so
taken
the
hex
wladek
shook
her
head
then
why
do
i
still
hear
the
voice
you
still
hear
it
the
gypsy
woman
muttered
under
her
breath
come
back
tomorrow
we
work
again
tomorrow
is
a
long
time
the
gypsy
woman
closed
her
eyes
for
a
second
all
right
she
said
and
snapped
them
open
four
this
afternoon
i
will
be
here
it
is
a
strong
curse
you
will
help
me
wladek
said
i
will
help
you
marya
proderenska
said
but
after
the
old
woman
had
left
marya
proderenska
sat
alone
and
her
face
was
troubled
the
strength
of
the
curse
she
had
felt
it
herself
was
enormous
she
did
not
know
of
any
magician
who
had
such
power
she
listed
over
the
members
of
her
own
clan
in
her
mind
and
became
satisfied
that
none
she
knew
was
responsible
and
yet
the
strength
of
the
curse
argued
real
power
was
it
possible
that
a
power
existed
within
the
city
and
she
did
not
know
of
it
marya
felt
a
cold
wind
on
her
back
the
wind
of
fear
such
a
power
might
do
anything
and
yet
it
was
being
used
to
coerce
one
useless
old
woman
into
taking
a
job
marya
proderenska
lay
flat
on
the
floor
her
arms
outstretched
thus
one
might
gather
the
vital
energies
four
was
not
many
hours
distant
and
by
four
she
would
need
all
of
the
energy
she
could
summon
she
did
not
allow
herself
to
become
doubtful
about
the
outcome
and
yet
she
was
afraid
gloria
smiled
understandingly
at
the
woman
who
sat
across
the
desk
i
understand
francis
she
said
it
not
that
tom
a
bad
boy
you
know
the
woman
said
but
he
easily
led
that
the
only
thing
of
course
gloria
said
she
looked
at
the
woman
wearing
a
gray
suit
that
did
not
fit
her
overweight
frame
and
a
silly
little
white
hat
i
sure
everything
going
to
be
all
right
she
said
francis
gave
a
little
gasp
oh
i
hope
so
she
said
tom
mean
to
cause
any
trouble
he
just
does
understand
gloria
went
over
the
report
sheets
mentally
tom
did
mean
to
cause
any
trouble
but
he
had
been
involved
in
a
gang
war
or
two
nothing
in
the
way
of
thompson
guns
of
course
or
mortars
just
a
few
pistols
and
and
rocks
and
broken
bottles
tom
had
been
killed
yet
that
was
gloria
thought
sadly
only
a
matter
of
time
he
had
killed
anybody
yet
either
but
he
come
close
tom
had
seen
the
inside
of
a
jail
or
two
a
lot
more
recently
than
he
seen
the
inside
of
a
classroom
tom
was
easily
led
sure
well
gloria
thought
the
problem
was
to
lead
him
into
something
more
productive
and
satisfying
than
the
gangs
of
new
york
and
that
seem
to
be
too
hard
of
course
she
had
very
little
practice
as
yet
the
theoretical
knowledge
she
been
able
to
dig
up
in
college
was
mostly
on
the
magic
and
superstition
shelves
of
the
library
and
while
she
got
full
credit
in
her
minor
anthropology
for
the
research
she
done
a
great
deal
of
it
just
was
any
practical
help
not
if
you
a
witch
or
what
passed
for
one
you
see
what
i
mean
do
you
francis
said
of
course
i
do
gloria
said
and
gave
the
woman
her
most
reassuring
smile
i
sure
something
can
be
done
do
you
know
where
your
boy
is
now
francis
nodded
birdlike
he
home
now
i
think
he
sleeping
he
usually
does
wake
up
until
after
noon
i
see
gloria
hesitated
a
moment
can
you
describe
him
for
me
describe
him
that
right
gloria
said
you
see
the
somatotypes
have
discovered
a
great
influence
on
mental
and
emotional
makeup
she
did
feel
right
lying
to
the
woman
but
chances
were
that
what
she
said
did
make
any
sense
to
francis
and
in
any
case
gloria
could
hardly
tell
her
the
real
reason
she
wanted
a
description
it
would
aid
in
making
the
doll
she
needed
he
about
six
feet
tall
francis
said
but
he
very
thin
and
sometimes
i
worry
about
that
i
try
to
give
him
the
best
nourishment
i
know
how
but
he
what
color
is
his
hair
gloria
interrupted
oh
francis
said
brown
and
brown
eyes
really
nice
eyes
they
his
best
feature
everybody
says
so
any
distinguishing
marks
or
anything
unusual
about
him
he
has
a
scar
now
on
his
left
arm
just
below
the
elbow
but
he
got
that
in
a
fight
with
these
boys
all
right
gloria
said
thank
you
very
much
what
are
you
going
to
do
francis
said
you
not
going
to
have
him
arrested
or
anything
are
you
because
he
not
a
bad
boy
you
know
that
he
only
easily
led
gloria
finished
of
course
there
wo
be
any
need
for
arrest
or
for
anything
as
drastic
as
that
you
just
go
home
now
and
do
worry
i
sure
everything
going
to
be
all
right
i
only
want
to
help
my
boy
francis
said
of
course
you
do
gloria
said
i
want
to
help
him
too
francis
stood
up
and
swallowed
hard
i
appreciate
that
she
said
it
my
job
that
all
gloria
said
feeling
unaccountably
shy
as
the
woman
left
she
thought
about
that
embarrassment
and
finally
decided
that
she
felt
she
had
no
right
to
be
complimented
she
was
doing
a
job
it
needed
to
be
done
that
was
all
true
she
had
special
talents
for
the
job
but
francis
did
know
that
and
she
had
made
the
talents
anyhow
but
been
born
with
them
congratulations
do
be
silly
as
a
matter
of
fact
gloria
thought
she
deserved
a
good
she
had
had
enough
experience
and
that
was
the
simple
truth
it
was
all
very
well
to
work
on
a
boy
like
rudi
or
another
one
like
tom
francis
when
they
did
have
any
idea
who
you
were
or
even
that
you
were
trying
to
do
something
that
was
easy
but
a
woman
like
wladek
she
was
suspicious
from
the
start
and
gloria
thought
that
perhaps
she
should
have
done
anything
but
it
was
obvious
that
the
woman
needed
help
to
become
a
functioning
member
of
society
the
only
trouble
was
that
gloria
had
been
quite
expert
enough
oh
given
enough
time
the
command
would
work
and
eventually
become
part
of
the
personality
but
because
wladek
had
been
afraid
and
a
little
forewarned
she
been
able
to
fight
off
the
command
a
little
gloria
told
herself
and
it
was
her
fault
that
she
could
do
any
better
next
time
she
have
a
little
more
practice
and
she
be
able
to
do
a
clearer
and
more
complete
job
and
in
the
meantime
there
was
no
real
harm
done
wladek
would
come
round
before
long
and
then
everything
would
be
all
right
why
after
all
there
was
rudi
too
and
rudi
undoubtedly
had
a
job
by
now
or
at
least
a
good
chance
of
one
through
an
employment
agency
there
was
no
reason
to
be
depressed
her
son
was
waiting
for
her
when
she
arrived
at
her
home
once
more
wladek
looked
at
the
boy
with
relief
and
some
suspicion
it
was
not
natural
for
rudi
to
be
at
home
during
such
an
hour
he
was
out
with
his
friends
through
the
day
and
this
was
good
for
a
boy
ma
rudi
said

what
you
are
in
trouble
wladek
said
at
once
in
a
heavy
voice
trouble
i
got
no
troubles
ma
rudi
said
he
stood
before
her
in
the
dusty
living
room
and
proud
and
it
came
to
wladek
all
at
once
that
her
boy
was
a
man
what
is
it
she
demanded
tell
me
at
once
sure

will
ma
rudi
said
i
got
a
job
i
start
tomorrow
in
an
office
wrapping
things
the
mail
room
they
call
it
silence
descended
on
the
little
room
ma
rudi
said
at
last
ma
what
wrong
wrong
wladek
said
what
should
be
wrong
nothing
at
all
is
wrong

have
a
job
very
well

have
a
job

not
happy
about

ma
wladek
gave
a
short
bark
happy
indeed
i
should
be
happy
my
son
goes
to
work
like
a
dog
and
i
should
be
she
paused
and
gasped
suddenly
why
did
you
go
to
work
you
mean
why
did
i
get
a
job
ma
rudi
said
listen
let
have
supper
and
we
talk
about
it
huh
supper
wladek
snorted
supper
we
will
have
when
i
find
out
what
i
need
to
know
not
before
but
i
hungry
ma
and
oh
all
right
rudi
sat
down
on
the
old
brown
couch
and
sighed
i
just
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
get
a
job
bring
some
bread
into
the
house
you
know
so
i
went
down
to
the
agency
and
they
had
this
application
waiting
and
i
went
down
and
got
the
job
and
i
start
tomorrow
that
all
now
let
eat
you
got
the
idea
to
have
a
job
wladek
said
fine
fine
just
fine
and
when
did
you
get
this
idea
i
do
know
rudi
said
and
shrugged
some
time
this
morning
maybe
look
what
difference
does
it
make
i
thought
you
like
the
idea
ma
some
more
dough
coming
in
you
know
this
morning
wladek
raised
clenched
fists
over
her
head
cossacks
she
screamed
monsters
witches
lunchtime
gloria
looked
up
and
smiled
sweetly
and
distantly
as
harold
meedy
appeared
at
her
desk
got
any
special
place
to
go
he
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
began
but
he
was
too
quick
for
her
it
always
a
matter
of
fact
he
said
what
the
matter
you
got
another
boy
friend
or
something
you
do
like
poor
harold
look
gloria
if
you
want
to
avoid
me
then
you
go
ahead
and
avoid
me
but
it
nothing
like
that
gloria
said
so
come
on
harold
said
listen
i
really
a
sweet
guy
when
you
get
to
know
me
you
like
me
sure
you
would
i
sure
gloria
said
but
i
really
do
have
something
to
take
care
of
ca
you
take
care
of
it
later
she
shook
her
head
well
all
right
if
you
want
me
to
grow
up
all
frustrated
he
grinned
at
her
and
moved
away
when
they
were
all
gone
and
only
fredericksohn
remained
in
his
private
office
behind
the
closed
door
gloria
opened
a
drawer
of
her
desk
and
took
out
a
piece
of
modeling
clay
a
little
bigger
than
her
fist
working
without
haste
and
never
bothering
to
look
up
she
made
a
doll
in
the
shape
of
a
tall
thin
boy
the
voodoo
sects
in
haiti
used
hair
or
fingernail
parings
from
the
subject
gloria
knew
she
had
learned
that
in
her
college
research
but
she
had
known
about
the
doll
long
before
hair
and
fingernail
parings
what
superstition
and
it
was
as
if
you
really
needed
the
doll
if
necessary
you
could
get
along
very
well
without
it
but
it
was
a
help
it
made
things
easier
and
why
not
she
tried
to
picture
tom
francis
his
mother
description
of
him
had
been
pretty
vague
but
gloria
found
she
could
locate
him
at
his
house
she
turned
the
doll
until
she
had
the
feeling
of
contact
and
then
there
it
did
take
long
actually
not
once
you
had
your
subject
located
tom
had
really
been
a
hard
case
his
juvenile
delinquency
gloria
was
quite
sure
was
a
thing
of
the
past
he
be
back
in
school
as
soon
as
the
details
could
be
worked
out
between
francis
and
the
board
of
education
and
that
would
take
care
of
that
with
a
satisfied
smile
she
put
the
doll
away
in
her
drawer
she
mash
it
back
into
clay
later
in
the
afternoon
that
would
enable
her
to
use
the
same
piece
over
and
over
again
clay
cost
money
and
a
case
worker
salary
was
large
gloria
could
not
see
how
she
could
put
the
cost
of
the
clay
down
on
a
special
requisition
anyhow
she
had
to
pay
for
it
herself
and
so
she
was
very
careful
and
saving
with
it
after
she
put
the
tom
doll
away
with
the
rudi
doll
making
a
mental
note
to
take
care
of
both
of
them
before
she
left
for
the
day
she
fished
out
her
beret
and
put
it
on
and
went
out
for
a
quick
lunch
it
was
just
after
two
when
gerne
came
in
the
others
were
used
to
his
periodic
arrivals
of
course
and
gloria
had
never
felt
any
fear
of
the
director
he
did
work
in
the
same
office
but
elsewhere
in
the
building
and
once
a
week
he
made
a
habit
of
touring
the
various
agencies
under
his
direction
it
kept
the
workers
on
their
toes
gloria
imagined
the
actual
sight
of
the
boss
boss
would
do
that
gerne
never
smiled
he
was
a
small
man
with
white
skin
and
very
little
hair
he
stood
in
the
outer
office
peering
round
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
nodding
his
head
slowly
he
went
on
and
knocked
at
fredericksohn
door
who
there
fredericksohn
called
from
inside
gerne
said
gerne
there
was
a
little
pause
and
then
fredericksohn
said
ah
come
in
the
door
opened
and
shut
and
gerne
was
invisible
gloria
picked
up
a
folder
and
pretended
to
concentrate
on
it
of
course
she
could
hear
what
was
happening
in
the
private
office
perfectly
well
she
remembered
studying
medieval
witchcraft
and
thought
suddenly
of
astral
bodies
but
that
had
been
a
guess
some
distance
from
the
truth
the
projection
of
the
sense
of
hearing
was
such
a
simple
thing
really
why
did
people
have
to
complicate
it
with
all
this
talk
about
witches
and
the
soul
she
was
reminded
of
wladek
but
put
the
woman
out
of
her
mind
gerne
was
talking
for
instance
the
new
girl
what
her
name
gloria
scott
fredericksohn
voice
said
yes
what
she
like
gerne
voice
said
i
do
know
her
personally
of
course
i
seen
her
there
in
the
office
and
she
seems
like
a
friendly
pretty
girl
but
you
deal
with
her
every
day
very
nice
fredericksohn
said
pleasant
and
easy
to
work
with
a
good
type
now
you
take
her
record
that
what
i
meant
gerne
said
a
record
like
that
it
just
not
possible
there
is
any
chance
she
faking
it
after
a
little
silence
fredericksohn
said
no
chance
at
all
had
on
a
random
selection
of
her
cases
standard
practice
for
a
newcomer
of
course
she
does
know
about
any
of
that
of
course
and
no
fakes
fredericksohn
said
and
do
tell
me
it
hard
to
believe
i
know
perfectly
well
it
hard
to
believe
no
returns
gerne
said
not
a
single
return
in
over
a
month
except
the
old
woman
fredericksohn
said
mrs
wladek
gloria
turned
a
page
in
the
report
she
was
holding
without
taking
her
attention
from
the
conversation
in
the
private
room
it
was
always
helpful
to
know
the
kind
of
thing
people
said
about
you
as
well
as
what
they
thought
it
gave
you
more
facts
to
work
with
and
made
you
more
efficient
and
better
able
to
work
at
your
chosen
profession
gerne
was
saying
you
can
discount
wladek
that
one
a
always
has
been
fredericksohn
said
all
right
then
discount
her
gerne
said
forget
about
her
and
outside
of
that
one
case
there
has
been
a
repeat
some
of
the
clients
have
died
fredericksohn
said
gerne
waited
a
second
then
he
said
a
little
higher
percentage
than
normal
so
i
mean
that
a
reason
for
some
of
the
and
the
others
gerne
paused
a
minute
and
then
went
on
you
discount
the
girl
record
like
that
i
was
trying
to
fredericksohn
said
mildly
i
was
only
pointing
out
let
those
go
gerne
said
obviously
she
had
no
control
over
that
sort
of
thing
unless
you
think
she
went
out
and
killed
them
of
course
not
fredericksohn
said
and
outside
of
that
then
no
repeats
the
girl
a
wonder
certainly
fredericksohn
said
let
see
how
long
it
keeps
up
that
all
gerne
said
pessimist
all
right
we
drop
the
subject
for
now
anyway
i
did
want
to
talk
to
you
about
the
progress
reports
we
been
getting
from
frazier
office
it
seems
to
me
gloria
broke
the
connection
frazier
a
supervisor
for
another
office
did
interest
her
she
only
wanted
to
hear
what
the
conversation
about
herself
would
be
like
well
now
she
knew
and
thankfully
no
one
suspected
a
thing
why
the
subject
had
been
brought
up
right
in
the
open
and
dropped
without
a
word
or
a
thought
unless
you
think
she
went
out
and
killed
them
gloria
did
smile
the
idea
was
not
funny
sometimes
you
had
to
do
something
like
that
but
the
necessity
did
make
it
pleasant
the
trouble
was
that
you
could
always
cure
something
by
a
simple
projection
into
the
mind
sometimes
you
ran
into
a
compulsion
that
was
really
deeply
buried
if
the
compulsion
was
a
big
one
and
went
back
far
into
childhood
gloria
could
do
anything
directly
about
it
sometimes
it
was
possible
to
work
around
and
of
course
you
did
that
when
you
could
the
important
thing
was
society
but
you
salvaged
the
individual
wherever
possible
where
it
was
possible
well
here
a
man
who
has
a
compulsion
to
get
drunk
and
when
drunk
he
got
to
pick
fights
maybe
he
has
killed
anybody
in
a
fight
yet
but
some
day
he
will
he
got
the
strength
and
under
the
influence
of
sufficient
alcohol
he
got
no
inhibitions
about
using
it
none
you
can
let
the
man
live
and
by
doing
that
kill
an
unknown
number
of
other
people
at
the
least
keeping
your
hands
and
your
mind
off
the
compulsive
will
serve
to
injure
others
how
many
others
and
how
badly
you
ca
tell
there
are
times
when
you
got
to
take
an
individual
life
in
your
hands
and
yet
because
you
ca
always
be
sure
gloria
talents
could
kill
out
of
hand
she
was
sure
but
she
use
them
that
way
instead
she
simply
projected
a
new
compulsion
into
the
mind
of
her
subject
the
next
time
he
got
drunk
and
wanted
to
start
a
fight
he
wanted
to
do
something
else
too
for
instance
walk
along
the
edges
of
roofs
the
original
compulsion
had
been
added
to
and
turned
into
a
compulsion
toward
suicide
that
was
what
it
amounted
to
gloria
did
like
doing
it
and
she
was
always
glad
when
it
necessary
but
there
was
a
dark
side
to
everything
even
she
thought
helping
people
she
told
herself
grimly
that
it
had
to
be
done
and
then
she
returned
to
her
work
wladek
pounded
on
the
door
of
the
gypsy
store
a
few
minutes
before
four
her
face
was
white
and
her
lips
set
in
a
thin
line
she
breathed
with
difficulty
and
with
every
move
she
made
she
could
feel
her
old
bones
creak
it
was
a
shame
what
was
being
done
to
an
old
woman
but
did
they
care
did
any
of
them
care
wladek
gave
a
little
snort
that
was
half
laughter
and
half
she
pounded
on
the
door
again
and
dropped
her
arm
feeling
old
and
tired
and
nearly
helpless
but
she
had
to
fight
on
there
was
a
limit
to
what
an
old
woman
could
be
expected
to
stand
they
would
learn
all
of
them
what
the
door
opened
marya
proderenska
said
yes
you
are
early
i
am
in
a
hurry
terrible
things
have
occurred
the
gypsy
woman
sighed
and
stepped
aside
come
in
then
she
said
and
wladek
entered
slowly
peering
round
the
front
room
come
in
the
back
the
gypsy
woman
said
i
have
been
preparing
to
help
you
but
more
is
required
it
was
wladek
turn
to
sigh
she
reached
into
her
purse
and
found
a
piece
which
she
handed
over
very
slowly
more
is
required
the
gypsy
woman
said
looking
at
the
coin
in
her
hand
as
if
wladek
thought
it
was
less
than
a
penny
did
not
the
woman
realize
that
fifty
cents
was
a
great
deal
of
money
for
a
poor
old
woman
no
one
had
any
pity
any
more
she
handed
over
another
fifty
cents
and
the
gypsy
woman
nodded
sadly
pocketed
the
money
and
led
the
way
to
the
back
room
you
will
help
me
now
wladek
said
i
will
try
the
room
was
silent
as
the
gypsy
woman
brought
all
her
knowledge
and
experience
into
play
finally
she
looked
at
wladek
and
said
a
very
powerful
curse
has
been
put
upon
you
i
ca
help
you
the
church
will
help
me
wladek
screamed
they
have
the
power
to
exorcise
do
not
speak
to
me
of
churches
the
gypsy
woman
shouted
wladek
shook
her
head
you
who
steal
my
money
who
steal
the
bread
from
my
old
mouth
without
pity
a
woman
must
live
marya
proderenska
said
with
great
dignity
the
housekeeper
had
said
father
seador
was
at
supper
this
did
not
make
a
difference
wladek
problem
was
certainly
serious
enough
to
interfere
with
any
man
supper
father
seador
was
overweight
in
any
case
should
he
miss
the
entire
meal
it
would
not
do
him
any
harm
marie
wladek
had
a
problem
and
a
serious
one
let
him
miss
his
supper
it
was
his
job
to
help
people
but
father
seador
would
certainly
not
be
in
the
best
of
moods
he
was
not
he
arrived
with
his
face
set
in
firm
lines
of
disapproval
wladek
got
up
from
her
chair
and
curtsied
toward
him
being
very
careful
of
her
old
bones
he
nodded
rudi
in
trouble
again
he
said
at
once
taking
a
chair
wladek
sat
herself
down
slowly
when
she
was
settled
she
looked
over
at
the
man
rudi
has
a
job
a
job
a
job
father
seador
blinked
that
fine
that
certainly
good
news
so
you
think
wladek
said
crisply
well
of
course
it
good
news
father
seador
said
responsibility
steady
income
wladek
i
sure
this
has
made
you
very
happy
but
if
you
pardon
me
father
seador
stood
up
i
in
the
middle
of
wait
wladek
said
this
is
not
what
i
have
come
to
talk
to
you
about
it
is
he
has
taken
a
job
it
is
i
will
be
taking
a
job

father
seador
seemed
incapable
of
speech
well
i
i
am
bewitched
wladek
said
a
curse
is
upon
me
a
curse
well
father
seador
stopped
and
cleared
his
throat
he
sat
down
again
he
blinked
at
last
he
said
what
wrong
mrs
wladek
i
have
told
you
she
said
a
curse
a
curse

want
you

exorcise

not
mistaken
i
tell
you
there
is
a
curse
upon
me
the
parlor
was
very
quiet
for
a
long
time
at
last
father
seador
said

really
believe

hexed

better
give
me
all
the
details

did
you

as
hard
as
iron

made
me
want
to
look

not
be
able
to
fight
the
curse
and
i
will
take
a
job
and
then
i
do
see
anything
wrong
about
that
father
seador
said
mildly
you
see
nothing
wrong
in
a
poor
old
woman
being
forced
to
work
in
a
boy
forced
to
grind
out
his
youth
among
you
see
nothing
wrong
in
this
well
i
we
all
have
to
work
here
wladek
said
with
astonishment
here
in
america
you
believe
that
it
is
not
so
my
own
uncle
bedrich
has
told
me
years
ago
it
is
not
so
do
you
dispute
the
word
of
my
own
uncle
bedrich
my
good
woman
said
father
seador
look
around
you
your
friends
your
neighbors
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
wladek
interrupted
there
is
a
curse
upon
me
and
i
have
called
on
you
to
remove
this
curse
how
do
you
know
this
is
a
curse
our
minds
do
change
you
know
and
they
do
strange
things
i
have
been
told
wladek
said
you
been
told
by
whom
wladek
drew
herself
up
in
the
chair
by
marya
proderenska
the
gypsy
fortune
teller
she
knows
that
a
gypsy
you
consulted
a
fortune
teller
i
did
wladek
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
what
you
have
done
do
you
realize
you
have
committed
a
sin
against
but
he
was
speaking
to
empty
air
marie
wladek
was
gone
gloria
looked
up
at
the
little
clock
and
sighed
briefly
five
another
day
gone
already
it
was
a
shame
in
a
way
that
time
passed
so
quickly
gloria
feel
the
least
bit
tired
after
all
she
had
spent
the
day
in
helping
people
and
that
was
what
made
life
worthwhile
but
it
was
quitting
time
staying
late
would
give
her
the
reputation
of
an
eager
beaver
and
that
would
make
her
unpopular
not
that
she
cared
for
popularity
for
its
own
sake
certainly
not
but
you
could
do
your
best
work
unless
the
others
in
your
office
were
willing
to
help
you
leaving
on
time
was
a
simple
sacrifice
to
make
for
them
she
pulled
open
the
desk
drawer
and
got
her
beret
then
as
she
was
putting
it
on
she
remembered
in
the
other
drawer
were
the
clay
models
she
opened
the
drawer
and
pulled
them
out
she
had
barely
reduced
them
to
a
single
amorphous
lump
when
fredericksohn
passed
her
desk
what
that
he
said
clay
a
nephew
of
mine
gloria
said
coolly
he
likes
to
play
with
clay
i
bought
some
and
i
taking
it
home
ah
fredericksohn
said
of
course
good
night
and
he
was
gone
gloria
put
the
clay
back
into
the
drawer
and
reached
for
her
beret
harold
meedy
called
from
across
the
room
going
home
that
right
she
said
can
i
charter
a
bus
and
drop
you
somewhere
i
afraid
not
she
said
i
really
got
to
get
right
home
listen
harold
said
he
came
over
to
her
desk
i
been
trying
to
get
somewhere
with
you
ever
since
you
walked
into
this
office
now
what
wrong
with
me
i
have
been
able
to
get
to
first
base
you
like
me
meedy
gloria
began
it
just
that
well
i
do
believe
in
relations
on
that
level
not
in
the
office
i
sorry
he
blinked
you
really
believe
that
do
you
of
course
i
do
she
said
but
he
shrugged
i
just
wanted
to
know
the
door
closed
behind
him
gloria
felt
a
little
relieved
if
matters
had
gone
on
the
way
they
threatened
why
she
might
have
had
to
change
harold
meedy
mind
for
him
not
that
it
would
have
done
him
any
harm
but
well
she
just
did
like
doing
that
sort
of
thing
for
purely
personal
reasons
she
was
glad
she
had
had
to
tamper
with
him
at
all
and
now
it
was
over
and
she
could
forget
about
it
humming
under
her
breath
she
put
her
beret
on
at
last
and
gave
the
stack
of
folders
a
pat
to
keep
them
absolutely
neat
before
she
left
the
office
she
still
felt
a
little
sad
about
leaving
on
time
when
there
was
so
much
work
to
be
done
but
tomorrow
she
told
herself
she
would
be
able
to
get
back
to
helping
people
tomorrow
tomorrow
ten
minutes
to
nine
and
gloria
put
her
beret
away
reached
for
the
first
folder
and
froze
a
second
later
the
door
opened
gloria
looked
up
and
smiled
helpfully
wladek
she
said
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
this
your
day
for
it
is
not
my
day
wladek
said
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
this
i
know
but
i
am
here
does
this
mean
anything
to
you
gloria
forced
her
face
to
remain
expressionless
can
i
help
you
in
any
way
she
said
is
there
anything
i
can
do
you
wladek
barked
you
have
done
enough
i
am
not
here
to
see
you
but
your
supervisor
your
boss
him
i
will
see
my
supervisor
gloria
looked
round
he
is
here
yet
he
will
be
here
later
of
course
he
will
gloria
said
wladek
sat
down
in
a
chair
next
to
gloria
desk
i
will
wait
she
announced
and
you
should
know
that
there
is
nothing
you
can
do
to
me
now
she
reached
into
her
bag
and
brought
out
a
small
wooden
cross
she
had
brought
with
her
from
the
old
country
she
waved
it
at
gloria
wildly
do
anything
to
you
what
do
you
mean
mrs
wladek
hah
wladek
said
you
need
not
pretend
with
me
this
frightens
you
no
gloria
blinked
i
afraid
not
she
said
but
you
are
trying
to
fool
me
wladek
said
and
i
will
not
be
fooled
i
wait
here
for
your
boss
your
supervisor
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
all
right
gloria
said
everybody
stared
of
course
but
none
of
the
other
workers
came
over
to
find
out
why
wladek
had
come
in
on
a
day
that
was
her
appointment
day
with
wladek
right
there
asking
questions
just
was
possible
gloria
tried
to
get
some
work
done
but
that
possible
either
and
she
resigned
herself
at
last
to
sitting
quietly
and
waiting
for
fredericksohn
arrival
she
promised
herself
she
make
up
for
the
loss
of
time
by
taking
a
shorter
lunch
hour
and
that
relieved
her
mind
a
little
but
she
did
hope
fredericksohn
would
be
early
thankfully
he
was
at
nine
exactly
the
door
opened
and
fredericksohn
entered
he
glanced
once
round
the
office
saw
wladek
and
went
on
a
second
later
he
stopped
he
did
have
a
chance
to
say
anything
wladek
was
at
his
side
i
must
see
you
at
once
she
said
i
must
see
you
alone
at
once
he
stared
at
her
miss
scott
here
i
sure
can
it
is
about
miss
scott
that
i
want
to
talk
to
you
wladek
hissed
fredericksohn
glanced
at
gloria
she
busied
herself
with
papers
at
last
he
said
come
with
me
and
led
wladek
down
the
aisle
into
his
private
office
the
door
closed
ten
minutes
passed
and
the
door
opened
fredericksohn
head
projected
miss
scott
he
said
may
i
see
you
for
a
minute
the
curiosity
in
the
office
was
almost
a
solid
pressure
but
gloria
paid
it
no
attention
she
said
certainly
put
away
the
folder
she
had
been
consulting
and
went
in
there
at
the
side
of
fredericksohn
desk
wladek
was
sitting
looking
determined
grim
and
baffled
all
at
once
gloria
stood
in
front
of
the
desk
and
fredericksohn
seated
himself
behind
it
the
large
open
window
at
his
back
yes
mr
fredericksohn
gloria
said
i
have
told
him
all
wladek
said
all
everything
total
er
yes
fredericksohn
said
he
faced
gloria
resolutely
wladek
has
said
something
about
a
about
a
spell
do
you
know
what
she
might
be
talking
about
something
you
said
some
impression
you
gave
her
a
spell
gloria
shook
her
head
i
ca
think
how
she
got
that
idea
she
said
calmly
you
do
not
fool
him
wladek
said
he
knows
i
have
told
him
all
certainly
fredericksohn
murmured
but
perhaps
some
little
thing
my
report
will
be
ready
in
an
hour
gloria
said
but
i
sure
there
was
nothing
fredericksohn
coughed
convulsively
i
suppose
not
he
said
i
realize
this
is
rather
unpleasant
for
you
i
quite
understand
gloria
said
wladek
came
out
of
her
chair
in
a
single
movement
and
clutched
gloria
by
the
left
arm
what
is
happening
she
demanded
fredericksohn
avoided
her
eye
please
sit
down
he
said
and
then
to
gloria
miss
scott
if
you
make
the
call
you
know
what
i
mean
of
course
she
said
the
he
whispered
it
the
hospital
what
did
you
say
wladek
demanded
what
did
you
tell
her
gloria
disengaged
herself
and
went
to
the
door
as
she
shut
it
behind
her
she
could
hear
wladek
voice
rising
to
a
crescendo
of
threats
and
abuse
and
fredericksohn
calm
scholarly
attempts
to
stem
the
tide
she
almost
smiled
then
she
went
to
her
own
desk
and
picked
up
the
telephone
actually
she
told
herself
matters
had
worked
out
for
the
best
rudi
had
a
job
and
would
grow
into
a
fully
functioning
member
of
society
wladek
would
not
be
on
the
relief
rolls
any
longer
and
what
wladek
wanted
a
place
to
live
and
someone
to
take
care
of
her
would
certainly
be
provided
for
her
yes
everything
had
worked
out
for
the
best
and
next
time
she
be
able
to
handle
a
situation
like
wladek
with
less
trouble
gloria
looked
into
the
future
into
a
long
series
of
days
and
weeks
helping
people
getting
them
to
do
what
was
best
for
them
oh
sometimes
they
would
like
it
right
away
but
you
had
to
expect
that
what
was
best
for
them
gloria
smiled
to
herself
quietly
and
dialed
a
number
on
the
second
ring
a
voice
said
bellevue
admitting
we
appreciate
your
sending
an
ambulance
and
attendants
right
away
gloria
said
for
the
psychiatric
wards
the
end
