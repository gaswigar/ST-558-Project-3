introduction
if
my
object
in
these
pages
were
to
present
a
complete
scheme
of
counsels
and
maxims
for
the
guidance
of
life
i
should
have
to
repeat
the
numerous
rules
some
of
them
excellent
which
have
been
drawn
up
by
thinkers
of
all
ages
from
theognis
and
solomon
down
to
la
rochefoucauld
and
in
so
doing
i
should
inevitably
entail
upon
the
reader
a
vast
amount
of
commonplace
but
the
fact
is
that
in
this
work
i
make
still
less
claim
to
exhaust
my
subject
than
in
any
other
of
my
writings
footnote
i
refer
to
the
proverbs
and
maxims
ascribed
in
the
old
testament
to
the
king
of
that
name
an
author
who
makes
no
claims
to
completeness
must
also
in
a
great
measure
abandon
any
attempt
at
systematic
arrangement
for
his
double
loss
in
this
respect
the
reader
may
console
himself
by
reflecting
that
a
complete
and
systematic
treatment
of
such
a
subject
as
the
guidance
of
life
could
hardly
fail
to
be
a
very
wearisome
business
i
have
simply
put
down
those
of
my
thoughts
which
appear
to
be
worth
communicating
thoughts
which
as
far
as
i
know
have
not
been
uttered
or
at
any
rate
not
just
in
the
same
form
by
any
one
else
so
that
my
remarks
may
be
taken
as
a
supplement
to
what
has
been
already
achieved
in
the
immense
field
however
by
way
of
introducing
some
sort
of
order
into
the
great
variety
of
matters
upon
which
advice
will
be
given
in
the
following
pages
i
shall
distribute
what
i
have
to
say
under
the
following
heads
general
rules
our
relation
to
ourselves
our
relation
to
others
and
finally
rules
which
concern
our
manner
of
life
and
our
worldly
circumstances
i
shall
conclude
with
some
remarks
on
the
changes
which
the
various
periods
of
life
produce
in
us
chapter
i
general
section
the
first
and
foremost
rule
for
the
wise
conduct
of
life
seems
to
me
to
be
contained
in
a
view
to
which
aristotle
parenthetically
refers
in
the
greek
o
phronimoz
to
alupon
dioke
e
ou
to
aedu
or
as
it
may
be
rendered
pleasure
but
freedom
from
pain
is
what
the
wise
man
will
aim
footnote
vii
the
truth
of
this
remark
turns
upon
the
negative
character
of
happiness
the
fact
that
pleasure
is
only
the
negation
of
pain
and
that
pain
is
the
positive
element
in
life
though
i
have
given
a
detailed
proof
of
this
proposition
in
my
chief
work
i
may
supply
one
more
illustration
of
it
here
drawn
from
a
circumstance
of
daily
occurrence
suppose
that
with
the
exception
of
some
sore
or
painful
spot
we
are
physically
in
a
sound
and
healthy
condition
the
sore
of
this
one
spot
will
completely
absorb
our
attention
causing
us
to
lose
the
sense
of
general
and
destroying
all
our
comfort
in
life
in
the
same
way
when
all
our
affairs
but
one
turn
out
as
we
wish
the
single
instance
in
which
our
aims
are
frustrated
is
a
constant
trouble
to
us
even
though
it
be
something
quite
trivial
we
think
a
great
deal
about
it
and
very
little
about
those
other
and
more
important
matters
in
which
we
have
been
successful
in
both
these
cases
what
has
met
with
resistance
is
in
the
one
case
as
it
is
objectified
in
the
organism
in
the
other
as
it
presents
itself
in
the
struggle
of
life
and
in
both
it
is
plain
that
the
satisfaction
of
the
will
consists
in
nothing
else
than
that
it
meets
with
no
resistance
it
is
therefore
a
satisfaction
which
is
not
directly
felt
at
most
we
can
become
conscious
of
it
only
when
we
reflect
upon
our
condition
but
that
which
checks
or
arrests
the
will
is
something
positive
it
proclaims
its
own
presence
all
pleasure
consists
in
merely
removing
this
check
in
other
words
in
freeing
us
from
its
action
and
hence
pleasure
is
a
state
which
can
never
last
very
long
footnote
als

p
this
is
the
true
basis
of
the
above
excellent
rule
quoted
from
aristotle
which
bids
us
direct
our
aim
not
toward
securing
what
is
pleasurable
and
agreeable
in
life
but
toward
avoiding
as
far
as
possible
its
innumerable
evils
if
this
were
not
the
right
course
to
take
that
saying
of
voltaire
is
but
a
dream
and
sorrow
is
would
be
as
false
as
it
is
in
fact
true
a
man
who
desires
to
make
up
the
book
of
his
life
and
determine
where
the
balance
of
happiness
lies
must
put
down
in
his
accounts
not
the
pleasures
which
he
has
enjoyed
but
the
evils
which
he
has
escaped
that
is
the
true
method
of
eudaemonology
for
all
eudaemonology
must
begin
by
recognizing
that
its
very
name
is
a
euphemism
and
that
live
only
means
live
less
to
live
a
tolerable
life
there
is
no
doubt
that
life
is
given
us
not
to
be
enjoyed
but
to
be
overcome
to
be
got
over
there
are
numerous
expressions
illustrating
this
such
as
vitam
vita
or
in
italian
scampa
or
in
german
muss
suchen
durchzukommen
er
wird
schon
durch
die
welt
and
so
on
in
old
age
it
is
indeed
a
consolation
to
think
that
the
work
of
life
is
over
and
done
with
the
happiest
lot
is
not
to
have
experienced
the
keenest
delights
or
the
greatest
pleasures
but
to
have
brought
life
to
a
close
without
any
very
great
pain
bodily
or
mental
to
measure
the
happiness
of
a
life
by
its
delights
or
pleasures
is
to
apply
a
false
standard
for
pleasures
are
and
remain
something
negative
that
they
produce
happiness
is
a
delusion
cherished
by
envy
to
its
own
punishment
pain
is
felt
to
be
something
positive
and
hence
its
absence
is
the
true
standard
of
happiness
and
if
over
and
above
freedom
from
pain
there
is
also
an
absence
of
boredom
the
essential
conditions
of
earthly
happiness
are
attained
for
all
else
is
chimerical
it
follows
from
this
that
a
man
should
never
try
to
purchase
pleasure
at
the
cost
of
pain
or
even
at
the
risk
of
incurring
it
to
do
so
is
to
pay
what
is
positive
and
real
for
what
is
negative
and
illusory
while
there
is
a
net
profit
in
sacrificing
pleasure
for
the
sake
of
avoiding
pain
in
either
case
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
whether
the
pain
follows
the
pleasure
or
precedes
it
while
it
is
a
complete
inversion
of
the
natural
order
to
try
and
turn
this
scene
of
misery
into
a
garden
of
pleasure
to
aim
at
joy
and
pleasure
rather
than
at
the
greatest
possible
freedom
from
pain
and
yet
how
many
do
it
there
is
some
wisdom
in
taking
a
gloomy
view
in
looking
upon
the
world
as
a
kind
of
hell
and
in
confining
one
efforts
to
securing
a
little
room
that
shall
not
be
exposed
to
the
fire
the
fool
rushes
after
the
pleasures
of
life
and
finds
himself
their
dupe
the
wise
man
avoids
its
evils
and
even
if
notwithstanding
his
precautions
he
falls
into
misfortunes
that
is
the
fault
of
fate
not
of
his
own
folly
as
far
as
he
is
successful
in
his
endeavors
he
can
not
be
said
to
have
lived
a
life
of
illusion
for
the
evils
which
he
shuns
are
very
real
even
if
he
goes
too
far
out
of
his
way
to
avoid
evils
and
makes
an
unnecessary
sacrifice
of
pleasure
he
is
in
reality
not
the
worse
off
for
that
for
all
pleasures
are
chimerical
and
to
mourn
for
having
lost
any
of
them
is
a
frivolous
and
even
ridiculous
proceeding
the
failure
to
recognize
this
truth
a
failure
promoted
by
optimistic
ideas
is
the
source
of
much
unhappiness
in
moments
free
from
pain
our
restless
wishes
present
as
it
were
in
a
mirror
the
image
of
a
happiness
that
has
no
counterpart
in
reality
seducing
us
to
follow
it
in
doing
so
we
bring
pain
upon
ourselves
and
that
is
something
undeniably
real
afterwards
we
come
to
look
with
regret
upon
that
lost
state
of
painlessness
it
is
a
paradise
which
we
have
gambled
away
it
is
no
longer
with
us
and
we
long
in
vain
to
undo
what
has
been
done
one
might
well
fancy
that
these
visions
of
wishes
fulfilled
were
the
work
of
some
evil
spirit
conjured
up
in
order
to
entice
us
away
from
that
painless
state
which
forms
our
highest
happiness
a
careless
youth
may
think
that
the
world
is
meant
to
be
enjoyed
as
though
it
were
the
abode
of
some
real
or
positive
happiness
which
only
those
fail
to
attain
who
are
not
clever
enough
to
overcome
the
difficulties
that
lie
in
the
way
this
false
notion
takes
a
stronger
hold
on
him
when
he
comes
to
read
poetry
and
romance
and
to
be
deceived
by
outward
show
the
hypocrisy
that
characterizes
the
world
from
beginning
to
end
on
which
i
shall
have
something
to
say
presently
the
result
is
that
his
life
is
the
more
or
less
deliberate
pursuit
of
positive
happiness
and
happiness
he
takes
to
be
equivalent
to
a
series
of
definite
pleasures
in
seeking
for
these
pleasures
he
encounters
danger
a
fact
which
should
not
be
forgotten
he
hunts
for
game
that
does
not
exist
and
so
he
ends
by
suffering
some
very
real
and
positive
misfortune
pain
distress
sickness
loss
care
poverty
shame
and
all
the
thousand
ills
of
life
too
late
he
discovers
the
trick
that
has
been
played
upon
him
but
if
the
rule
i
have
mentioned
is
observed
and
a
plan
of
life
is
adopted
which
proceeds
by
avoiding
pain
in
other
words
by
taking
measures
of
precaution
against
want
sickness
and
distress
in
all
its
forms
the
aim
is
a
real
one
and
something
may
be
achieved
which
will
be
great
in
proportion
as
the
plan
is
not
disturbed
by
striving
after
the
chimera
of
positive
happiness
this
agrees
with
the
opinion
expressed
by
goethe
in
the
and
there
put
into
the
mouth
of
mittler
the
man
who
is
always
trying
to
make
other
people
happy
desire
to
get
rid
of
an
evil
is
a
definite
object
but
to
desire
a
better
fortune
than
one
has
is
blind
the
same
truth
is
contained
in
that
fine
french
proverb
mieux
est
du
leave
well
alone
and
as
i
have
remarked
in
my
chief
work
this
is
the
leading
thought
underlying
the
philosophical
system
of
the
cynics
for
what
was
it
led
the
cynics
to
repudiate
pleasure
in
every
form
if
it
was
not
the
fact
that
pain
is
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
always
bound
up
with
pleasure
to
go
out
of
the
way
of
pain
seemed
to
them
so
much
easier
than
to
secure
pleasure
deeply
impressed
as
they
were
by
the
negative
nature
of
pleasure
and
the
positive
nature
of
pain
they
consistently
devoted
all
their
efforts
to
the
avoidance
of
pain
the
first
step
to
that
end
was
in
their
opinion
a
complete
and
deliberate
repudiation
of
pleasure
as
something
which
served
only
to
entrap
the
victim
in
order
that
he
might
be
delivered
over
to
pain
footnote

we
are
all
born
as
schiller
says
in
arcadia
in
other
words
we
come
into
the
world
full
of
claims
to
happiness
and
pleasure
and
we
cherish
the
fond
hope
of
making
them
good
but
as
a
rule
fate
soon
teaches
us
in
a
rough
and
ready
way
that
we
really
possess
nothing
at
all
but
that
everything
in
the
world
is
at
its
command
in
virtue
of
an
unassailable
right
not
only
to
all
we
have
or
acquire
to
wife
or
child
but
even
to
our
very
limbs
our
arms
legs
and
ears
nay
even
to
the
nose
in
the
middle
of
our
face
and
in
any
case
after
some
little
time
we
learn
by
experience
that
happiness
and
pleasure
are
a
which
visible
from
afar
vanish
as
we
approach
that
on
the
other
hand
suffering
and
pain
are
a
reality
which
makes
its
presence
felt
without
any
intermediary
and
for
its
effect
stands
in
no
need
of
illusion
or
the
play
of
false
hope
if
the
teaching
of
experience
bears
fruit
in
us
we
soon
give
up
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
and
happiness
and
think
much
more
about
making
ourselves
secure
against
the
attacks
of
pain
and
suffering
we
see
that
the
best
the
world
has
to
offer
is
an
existence
free
from
pain
a
quiet
tolerable
life
and
we
confine
our
claims
to
this
as
to
something
we
can
more
surely
hope
to
achieve
for
the
safest
way
of
not
being
very
miserable
is
not
to
expect
to
be
very
happy
merck
the
friend
of
goethe
youth
was
conscious
of
this
truth
when
he
wrote
is
the
wretched
way
people
have
of
setting
up
a
claim
to
that
to
in
a
measure
corresponding
with
their
ruins
everything
in
this
world
a
man
will
make
progress
if
he
can
get
rid
of
this
claim
and
desire
nothing
but
what
he
sees
before
accordingly
it
is
advisable
to
put
very
moderate
limits
upon
our
expectations
of
pleasure
possessions
rank
honor
and
so
on
because
it
is
just
this
striving
and
struggling
to
be
happy
to
dazzle
the
world
to
lead
a
life
full
of
pleasure
which
entail
great
misfortune
it
is
prudent
and
wise
i
say
to
reduce
one
claims
if
only
for
the
reason
that
it
is
extremely
easy
to
be
very
unhappy
while
to
be
very
happy

not
indeed
difficult

quite
impossible

the
chief
obstacle
to
our
arriving
at
these
salutary
views
is
that
hypocrisy
of
the
world
to
which
i
have
already
alluded
an
hypocrisy
which
should
be
early
revealed
to
the
young
most
of
the
glories
of
the
world
are
mere
outward
show
like
the
scenes
on
a
stage
there
is
nothing
real
about
them
ships
festooned
and
hung
with
pennants
firing
of
cannon
illuminations
beating
of
drums
and
blowing
of
trumpets
shouting
and
applauding
these
are
all
the
outward
sign
the
pretence
and
suggestion
as
it
were
the
hieroglyphic
of
but
just
there
joy
is
as
a
rule
not

is
the
only
guest
who
has
declined
to
be
present
at
the
festival
where
this
guest
may
really
be
found
he
comes
generally
without
invitation
he
is
not
formerly
announced
but
slips
in
quietly
by
himself
often
making
his
appearance
under
the
most
unimportant
and
trivial
circumstances
and
in
the
commonest
company
anywhere
in
short
but
where
the
society
is
brilliant
and
distinguished
joy
is
like
the
gold
in
the
australian
mines
found
only
now
and
then
as
it
were
by
the
caprice
of
chance
and
according
to
no
rule
or
law
oftenest
in
very
little
grains
and
very
seldom
in
heaps
all
that
outward
show
which
i
have
described
is
only
an
attempt
to
make
people
believe
that
it
is
really
joy
which
has
come
to
the
festival
and
to
produce
this
impression
upon
the
spectators
is
in
fact
the
whole
object
of
it
with
it
is
just
the
same
that
long
funeral
procession
moving
up
so
slowly
how
melancholy
it
looks
what
an
endless
row
of
carriages
but
look
into
them
they
are
all
empty
the
coachmen
of
the
whole
town
are
the
sole
escort
the
dead
man
has
to
his
grave
eloquent
picture
of
the
friendship
and
esteem
of
the
world
this
is
the
falsehood
the
hollowness
the
hypocrisy
of
human
affairs
take
another
example
a
roomful
of
guests
in
full
dress
being
received
with
great
ceremony
you
could
almost
believe
that
this
is
a
noble
and
distinguished
company
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
compulsion
pain
and
boredom
who
are
the
real
guests
for
where
many
are
invited
it
is
a
rabble
even
if
they
all
wear
stars
really
good
society
is
everywhere
of
necessity
very
small
in
brilliant
festivals
and
noisy
entertainments
there
is
always
at
bottom
a
sense
of
emptiness
prevalent
a
false
tone
is
there
such
gatherings
are
in
strange
contrast
with
the
misery
and
barrenness
of
our
existence
the
contrast
brings
the
true
condition
into
greater
relief
still
these
gatherings
are
effective
from
the
outside
and
that
is
just
their
purpose
chamfort
makes
the
excellent
remark
that
cercles

is
like
a
miserable
play
or
a

such

the

out
of

reckoning
we
forget
that
the
capacity
whether
for
achievement
or
for
enjoyment
does
not
last
a
whole
lifetime
so
we
often
toil
for
things
which
are
no
longer
suited
to
us
when
we
attain
them
and
again
the
years
we
spend
in
preparing
for
some
work
unconsciously
rob
us
of
the
power
for
carrying
it
out
how
often
it
happens

a

which
he
acquired
at
so

that
the
fruits
of

that
he
is

which
he
has
won

the
cause
of
this
commonest
of
all
follies
is
that
optical
illusion
of
the
mind
from
which
everyone
suffers
making
life
at
its
beginning
seem
of
long
duration
and
at
its
end
when
one
looks
back
over
the
course
of
it
how
short
a
time
it
seems
there
is
some
advantage
in
the
illusion
but
for
it
no
great
work
would
ever
be
done
our
life
is
like
a
journey
on
which
as
we
advance
the
landscape
takes
a
different
view
from
that
which
it
presented
at
first
and
changes
again
as
we
come
nearer
this
is
just
what
happens
especially
with
our
wishes
we
often
find
something
else
nay
something
better
than
what
we
are
looking
for
and
what
we
look
for
we
often
find
on
a
very
different
path
from
that
on
which
we
began
a
vain
search
instead
of
finding
as
we
expected
pleasure
happiness
joy
we
get
experience
insight
knowledge
a
real
and
permanent
blessing
instead
of
a
fleeting
and
illusory
one
this
is
the
thought
that
runs
through
like
the
bass
in
a
piece
of
music
in
this
work
of
goethe
we
have
a
novel
of
the
kind
and
therefore
superior
to
all
others
even
to
sir
walter
scott
which
are
one
and
all
in
other
words
they
treat
of
human
nature
only
from
the
side
of
the
will
so
too
in
the
that
grotesque
but
still
significant
and
even
hieroglyphic
the
same
thought
is
symbolized
but
in
great
coarse
lines
much
in
the
way
in
which
scenery
is
painted
here
the
symbol
would
be
complete

be
moulded
by
its
teachings
they
recognize
that
the
fruit
of
life
is
experience
and
not
happiness
they
become
accustomed
and
content
to
exchange
hope
for
insight
and
in
the
end
they
can
say
with
petrarch
that
all
they

to

the
mason
employed
on
the
building
of
a
house
may
be
quite
ignorant
of
its
general
design
or
at
any
rate
he
may
not
keep
it
constantly
in
mind
so
it
is
with
man
in
working
through
the
days
and
hours
of
his
life
he
takes
little
thought
of
its
character
as
a
whole
if
there
is
any
merit
or
importance
attaching
to
a
man
career
if
he
lays
himself
out
carefully
for
some
special
work
it
is
all
the
more
necessary
and
advisable
for
him
to
turn
his
attention
now
and
then
to
its
that
is
to
say
the
miniature
sketch
of
its
general
outlines
of
course
to
do
that
he
must
have
applied
the
maxim
greek
gnothi
seauton
he
must
have
made
some
little
progress
in
the
art
of
understanding
himself
he
must
know
what
is
his
real
chief
and
foremost
object
in
life
what
it
is
that
he
most
wants
in
order
to
be
happy
and
then
after
that
what
occupies
the
second
and
third
place
in
his
thoughts
he
must
find
out
what
on
the
whole
his
vocation
really
is
the
part
he
has
to
play
his
general
relation
to
the
world
if
he
maps
out
important
work
for
himself
on
great
lines
a
glance
at
this
miniature
plan
of
his
life
will
more
than
anything
else
stimulate
rouse
and
ennoble
him
urge
him
on
to
action
and
keep
him
from
false
paths
again
just
as
the
traveler
on
reaching
a
height
gets
a
connected
view
over
the
road
he
has
taken
with
its
many
turns
and
windings
so
it
is
only
when
we
have
completed
a
period
in
our
life
or
approach
the
end
of
it
altogether
that
we
recognize
the
true
connection
between
all
our
actions
what
it
is
we
have
achieved
what
work
we
have
done
it
is
only
then
that
we
see
the
precise
chain
of
cause
and
effect
and
the
exact
value
of
all
our
efforts
for
as
long
as
we
are
actually
engaged
in
the
work
of
life
we
always
act
in
accordance
with
the
nature
of
our
character
under
the
influence
of
motive
and
within
the
limits
of
our
capacity
in
a
word
from
beginning
to
end
under
a
law
of
at
every
moment
we
do
just
what
appears
to
us
right
and
proper
it
is
only
afterwards
when
we
come
to
look
back
at
the
whole
course
of
our
life
and
its
general
result
that
we
see
the
why
and
wherefore
of
it
all
when
we
are
actually
doing
some
great
deed
or
creating
some
immortal
work
we
are
not
conscious
of
it
as
such
we
think
only
of
satisfying
present
aims
of
fulfilling
the
intentions
we
happen
to
have
at
the
time
of
doing
the
right
thing
at
the
moment
it
is
only
when
we
come
to
view
our
life
as
a
connected
whole
that
our
character
and
capacities
show
themselves
in
their
true
light
that
we
see
how
in
particular
instances
some
happy
inspiration
as
it
were
led
us
to
choose
the
only
true
path
out
of
a
thousand
which
might
have
brought
us
to
ruin
it
was
our
genius
that
guided
us
a
force
felt
in
the
affairs
of
the
intellectual
as
in
those
of
the
world
and
working
by
its
defect
just
in
the
same
way
in
regard
to
evil
and
disaster
section
another
important
element
in
the
wise
conduct
of
life
is
to
preserve
a
proper
proportion
between
our
thought
for
the
present
and
our
thought
for
the
future
in
order
not
to
spoil
the
one
by
paying
attention
to
the
other
many
live
too
long
in
the
present
frivolous
people
i
mean
others
too
much
in
the
future
ever
anxious
and
full
of
care
it
is
seldom
that
a
man
holds
the
right
balance
between
the
two
extremes
those
who
strive
and
hope
and
live
only
in
the
future
always
looking
ahead
and
impatiently
anticipating
what
is
coming
as
something
which
will
make
them
happy
when
they
get
it
are
in
spite
of
their
very
clever
airs
exactly
like
those
donkeys
one
sees
in
italy
whose
pace
may
be
hurried
by
fixing
a
stick
on
their
heads
with
a
wisp
of
hay
at
the
end
of
it
this
is
always
just
in
front
of
them
and
they
keep
on
trying
to
get
it
such
people
are
in
a
constant
state
of
illusion
as
to
their
whole
existence
they
go
on
living
until
at
last
they
die
instead
therefore
of
always
thinking
about
our
plans
and
anxiously
looking
to
the
future
or
of
giving
ourselves
up
to
regret
for
the
past
we
should
never
forget
that
the
present
is
the
only
reality
the
only
certainty
that
the
future
almost
always
turns
out
contrary
to
our
expectations
that
the
past
too
was
very
different
from
what
we
suppose
it
to
have
been
but
the
past
and
the
future
are
on
the
whole
of
less
consequence
than
we
think
distance
which
makes
objects
look
small
to
the
outward
eye
makes
them
look
big
to
the
eye
of
thought
the
present
alone
is
true
and
actual
it
is
the
only
time
which
possesses
full
reality
and
our
existence
lies
in
it
exclusively
therefore
we
should
always
be
glad
of
it
and
give
it
the
welcome
it
deserves
and
enjoy
every
hour
that
is
bearable
by
its
freedom
from
pain
and
annoyance
with
a
full
consciousness
of
its
value
we
shall
hardly
be
able
to
do
this
if
we
make
a
wry
face
over
the
failure
of
our
hopes
in
the
past
or
over
our
anxiety
for
the
future
it
is
the
height
of
folly
to
refuse
the
present
hour
of
happiness
or
wantonly
to
spoil
it
by
vexation
at
or
uneasiness
about
what
is
to
come
there
is
a
time
of
course
for
forethought
nay
even
for
repentance
but
when
it
is
over
let
us
think
of
what
is
past
as
of
something
to
which
we
have
said
farewell
of

which
are

to

any

to
disturb
us
and
how

there

fulfill

are

the
time
at

who
is

preparing
for
either
class
of
evil
will
not
have
a
moment
of
peace
left
him
so
if
we
are
not
to
lose
all
comfort
in
life
through
the
fear
of
evils
some
of
which
are
uncertain
in
themselves
and
others
in
the
time
at
which
they
will
occur
we
should
look
upon
the
one
kind
as
never
likely
to
happen
and
the
other
as
not
likely
to
happen
very
soon
now
the
less
our
peace
of
mind
is
disturbed
by
fear
the
more
likely
it
is
to
be
agitated
by
desire
and
expectation
this
is
the
true
meaning
of
that
song
of
goethe
which
is
such
a
favorite
with
everyone
hab

it
is
only
after
a
man
has
got
rid
of
all
pretension
and
taken
refuge
in
mere
unembellished
existence
that
he
is
able
to
attain
that
peace
of
mind
which
is
the
foundation
of
human
happiness
peace
of
mind
that
is
something
essential
to
any
enjoyment
of
the
present
moment
and
unless
its
separate
moments
are
enjoyed
there
is
an
end
of
life
happiness
as
a
whole
we
should
always
collect
that
comes
only
once
and
never
returns
we
fancy
that
it
will
come
again
but
is
another
day
which
in
its
turn
comes
once
only
we
are
apt
to
forget
that
every
day
is
an
integral
and
therefore
irreplaceable
portion
of
life
and
to
look
upon
life
as
though
it
were
a
collective
idea
or
name
which
does
not
suffer
if
one
of
the
individuals
it
covers
is
destroyed
we
should
be
more
likely
to
appreciate
and
enjoy
the
present
if
in
those
good
days
when
we
are
well
and
strong
we
did
not
fail
to
reflect
how
in
sickness
and
sorrow
every
past
hour
that
was
free
from
pain
and
privation
seemed
in
our
memory
so
infinitely
to
be
envied
as
it
were
a
lost
paradise
or
some
one
who
was
only
then
seen
to
have
acted
as
a
friend
but
we
live
through
our
days
of
happiness
without
noticing
them
it
is
only
when
evil
comes
upon
us
that
we
wish
them
back
a
thousand
gay
and
pleasant
hours
are
wasted
in
we
let
them
slip
by
unenjoyed
and
sigh
for
them
in
vain
when
the
sky
is
overcast
those
present
moments
that
are
bearable
be
they
never
so
trite
and
common
passed
by
in
indifference
or
it
may
be
impatiently
pushed
away
those
are
the
moments
we
should
honor
never
failing
to
remember
that
the
ebbing
tide
is
even
how
hurrying
them
into
the
past
where
memory
will
store
them
transfigured
and
shining
with
an
imperishable
light
in
some
and
above
all
when
our
days
are
evil
to
raise
the
veil
and
present
them
as
the
object
of
our
fondest
regret
section
always
make
for
we
are
happy
in
proportion
as
our
range
of
vision
our
sphere
of
work
our
points
of
contact
with
the
world
are
restricted
and
circumscribed
we
are
more
likely
to
feel
worried
and
anxious
if
these
limits
are
wide
for
it
means
that
our
cares
desires
and
terrors
are
increased
and
intensified
that
is
why
the
blind
are
not
so
unhappy
as
we
might
be
inclined
to
suppose
otherwise
there
would
not
be
that
gentle
and
almost
serene
expression
of
peace
in
their
faces
another
reason
why
limitation
makes
for
happiness
is
that
the
second
half
of
life
proves
even
more
dreary
that
the
first
as
the
years
wear
on
the
horizon
of
our
aims
and
our
points
of
contact
with
the
world
become
more
extended
in
childhood
our
horizon
is
limited
to
the
narrowest
sphere
about
us
in
youth
there
is
already
a
very
considerable
widening
of
our
view
in
manhood
it
comprises
the
whole
range
of
our
activity
often
stretching
out
over
a
very
distant
sphere
the
care
for
instance
of
a
state
or
a
nation
in
old
age
it
embraces
posterity
but
even
in
the
affairs
of
the
intellect
limitation
is
necessary
if
we
are
to
be
happy
for
the
less
the
will
is
excited
the
less
we
suffer
we
have
seen
that
suffering
is
something
positive
and
that
happiness
is
only
a
negative
condition
to
limit
the
sphere
of
outward
activity
is
to
relieve
the
will
of
external
stimulus
to
limit
the
sphere
of
our
intellectual
efforts
is
to
relieve
the
will
of
internal
sources
of
excitement
this
latter
kind
of
limitation
is
attended
by
the
disadvantage
that
it
opens
the
door
to
boredom
which
is
a
direct
source
of
countless
sufferings
for
to
banish
boredom
a
man
will
have
recourse
to
any
means
that
may
be
handy
dissipation
society
extravagance
gaming
and
drinking
and
the
like
which
in
their
turn
bring
mischief
ruin
and
misery
in
their
train
in
otio
it
is
difficult
to
keep
quiet
if
you
have
nothing
to
do
that
limitation
in
the
sphere
of
outward
activity
is
conducive
nay
even
necessary
to
human
happiness
such
as
it
is
may
be
seen
in
the
fact
that
the
only
kind
of
poetry
which
depicts
men
in
a
happy
state
of
life
idyllic
poetry
i
mean
always
aims
as
an
intrinsic
part
of
its
treatment
at
representing
them
in
very
simple
and
restricted
circumstances
it
is
this
feeling
too
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
pleasure
we
take
in
what
are
called
pictures
therefore
as
far
as
it
can
be
attained
and
even
in
our
manner
of
life
if
it
does
not
mean
that
we
are
bored
will
contribute
to
happiness
just
because
under
such
circumstances
life
and
consequently
the
burden
which
is
the
essential
concomitant
of
life
will
be
least
felt
our
existence
will
glide
on
peacefully
like
a
stream
which
no
waves
or
whirlpools
disturb
section
whether
we
are
in
a
pleasant
or
a
painful
state
depends
ultimately
upon
the
kind
of
matter
that
pervades
and
engrosses
our
consciousness
in
this
respect
purely
intellectual
occupation
for
the
mind
that
is
capable
of
it
will
as
a
rule
do
much
more
in
the
way
of
happiness
than
any
form
of
practical
life
with
its
constant
alternations
of
success
and
failure
and
all
the
shocks
and
torments
it
produces
but
it
must
be
confessed
that
for
such
occupation
a
amount
of
intellectual
capacity
is
necessary
and
in
this
connection
it
may
be
noted
that
just
as
a
life
devoted
to
outward
activity
will
distract
and
divert
a
man
from
study
and
also
deprive
him
of
that
quiet
concentration
of
mind
which
is
necessary
for
such
work
so
on
the
other
hand
a
long
course
of
thought
will
make
him
more
or
less
unfit
for
the
noisy
pursuits
of
real
life
it
is
advisable
therefore
to
suspend
mental
work
for
a
while
if
circumstances
happen
which
demand
any
degree
of
energy
in
affairs
of
a
practical
nature
section
to
live
a
life
that
shall
be
entirely
prudent
and
discreet
and
to
draw
from
experience
all
the
instruction
it
contains
it
is
requisite
to
be
constantly
thinking
back
to
make
a
kind
of
recapitulation
of
what
we
have
done
of
our
impressions
and
sensations
to
compare
our
former
with
our
present
judgments
what
we
set
before
us
and
struggle
to
achieve
with
the
actual
result
and
satisfaction
we
have
obtained
to
do
this
is
to
get
a
repetition
of
the
private
lessons
of
experience
lessons
which
are
given
to
every
one
experience

the

be
looked
upon

a

form
the

there
is
great

result
is

the
advice
here
given
is
on
a
par
with
a
rule
recommended
by
pythagoras
to
review
every
night
before
going
to
sleep
what
we
have
done
during
the
day
to
live
at
random
in
the
of

pleasure
without
ever
reflecting
upon
the
past
to
go
on
as
it
were
pulling
cotton
off
the
reel
of
life
is
to
have
no
clear
idea
of
what
we
are
about
and
a
man
who
lives
in
this
state
will
have
chaos
in
his
emotions
and
certain
confusion
in
his
thoughts
as
is
soon
manifest
by
the
abrupt
and
fragmentary
character
of
his
conversation
which
becomes
a
kind
of
mincemeat
a
man
will
be
all
the
more
exposed
to
this
fate
in
proportion
as
he
lives
a
restless
life
in
the
world
amid
a
crowd
of
various
impressions
and
with
a
correspondingly
small
amount
of
activity
on
the
part
of
his
own
mind
and
in
this
connection
it
will
be
in
place
to
observe
that
when
events
and
circumstances
which
have
influenced
us
pass
away
in
the
course
of
time
we
are
unable
to
bring
back
and
renew
the
particular
mood
or
state
of
feeling
which
they
aroused
in
us
but
we
can
remember
what
we
were
led
to
say
and
do
in
regard
to
them
and
thus
form
as
it
were
the
result
expression
and
measure
of
those
events
we
should
therefore
be
careful
to
preserve
the
memory
of
our
thoughts
at
important
points
in
our
life

herein
lies
the
great
advantage

keeping

it

we

that

if
a

stands

lists
it

inevitable
that
he
should
feel
solitary
it
will
be
an
advantage
to
him
if
his
surroundings
do
not
interfere
with
this
feeling
for
if
he
has
to
see
a
great
deal
of
other
people
who
are
not

character
with

they
will
exercise
a

his
peace

they
will
rob
him
in

of
himself
and
give
him
nothing

compensate
for
the
loss
but
while
nature
sets
very
wide
differences
between
man
and
man
in
respect
both
of
morality
and
of
intellect
society
disregards
and
effaces
them
or
rather
it
sets
up
artificial
differences
in
their
stead
gradations
of
rank
and
position
which
are
very
often
diametrically
opposed
to
those
which
nature
establishes
the
result
of
this
arrangement
is
to
elevate
those
whom
nature
has
placed
low
and
to
depress
the
few
who
stand
high
these
latter
then
usually
withdraw
from
society
where
as
soon
as
it
is
at
all
numerous
vulgarity
reigns
supreme
what
offends
a
great
intellect
in
society
is
the
equality
of
rights
leading
to
equality
of
pretensions
which
everyone
enjoys
while
at
the
same
time
inequality
of
capacity
means
a
corresponding
disparity
of
social
power
recognizes
every
kind
of
claim
but
that
of
intellect
which
is
a
contraband
article
and
people
are
expected
to
exhibit
an
unlimited
amount
of
patience
towards
every
form
of
folly
and
stupidity
perversity
and
dullness
whilst
personal
merit
has
to
beg
pardon
as
it
were
for
being
present
or
else
conceal
itself
altogether
intellectual
superiority
offends
by
its
very
existence
without
any
desire
to
do
so
the
worst
of
what
is
called
good
society
is
not
only
that
it
offers
us
the
companionship
of
people
who
are
unable
to
win
either
our
praise
or
our
affection
but
that
it
does
not
allow
of
our
being
that
which
we
naturally
are
it
compels
us
for
the
sake
of
harmony
to
shrivel
up
or
even
alter
our
shape
altogether
intellectual
conversation
whether
grave
or
humorous
is
only
fit
for
intellectual
society
it
is
downright
abhorrent
to
ordinary
people
to
please
whom
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
be
commonplace
and
dull
this
demands
an
act
of
severe
we
have
to
forfeit
of
ourselves
in
order
to
become
like
other
people
no
doubt
their
company
may
be
set
down
against
our
loss
in
this
respect
but
the
more
a
man
is
worth
the
more
he
will
find
that
what
he
gains
does
not
cover
what
he
loses
and
that
the
balance
is
on
the
debit
side
of
the
account
for
the
people
with
whom
he
deals
are
generally
bankrupt
that
is
to
say
there
is
nothing
to
be
got
from
their
society
which
can
compensate
either
for
its
boredom
annoyance
and
disagreeableness
or
for
the
which
it
renders
necessary
accordingly
most
society
is
so
constituted
as
to
offer
a
good
profit
to
anyone
who
will
exchange
it
for
solitude
nor
is
this
all
by
way
of
providing
a
substitute
for
real
i
mean
intellectual
superiority
which
is
seldom
to
be
met
with
and
intolerable
when
it
is
found
society
has
capriciously
adopted
a
false
kind
of
superiority
conventional
in
its
character
and
resting
upon
arbitrary
principles
a
tradition
as
it
were
handed
down
in

circles

like
a

subject

i
refer
to

whenever
this
kind
of
superiority
comes
into
collision
with
the
real
kind
its
weakness
is
manifest
moreover
the
presence
of
means
the
absence
of
no
man
can
be
in
with
any
one
but
himself
not
even
with
a
friend
or
the
partner
of
his
life
differences
of
individuality
and
temperament
are
always
bringing
in
some
degree
of
discord
though
it
may
be
a
very
slight
one
that
genuine
profound
peace
of
mind
that
perfect
tranquillity
of
soul
which
next
to
health
is
the
highest
blessing
the
earth
can
give
is
to
be
attained
only
in
solitude
and
as
a
permanent
mood
only
in
complete
retirement
and
then
if
there
is
anything
great
and
rich
in
the
man
own
self
his
way
of
life
is
the
happiest
that
may
be
found
in
this
wretched
world
let
me
speak
plainly
however
close
the
bond
of
friendship
love
marriage
a
man
ultimately
looks
to
himself
to
his
own
welfare
alone
at
most
to
his
child
too
the
less
necessity
there
is
for
you
to
come
into
contact
with
mankind
in
general
in
the
relations
whether
of
business
or
of
personal
intimacy
the
better
off
you
are
loneliness
and
solitude
have
their
evils
it
is
true
but
if
you
can
not
feel
them
all
at
once
you
can
at
least
see
where
they
lie
on
the
other
hand
society
is
in
this
respect
as
in
offering
you
what
appears
to
be
the
pastime
of
pleasing
social
intercourse
it
works
great
and
often
irreparable
mischief
the
young
should
early
be
trained
to
bear
being
left
alone
for
it
is
a
source
of
happiness
and
peace
of
mind
it
follows
from
this
that
a
man
is
best
off
if
he
be
thrown
upon
his
own
resources
and
can
be
all
in
all
to
himself
and
cicero
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
man
who
is
in
this
condition
can
not
fail
to
be
very
happy
potest
non
beatissimus

ponit
the
more
a
man
has
in
himself
the
less
others
can
be
to
him
the
feeling
of
it
is
that
which
restrains
those
whose
personal
value
is
in
itself
great
riches
from
such
considerable
sacrifices
as
are
demanded
by
intercourse
with
the
world
let
alone
then
from
actually
practicing
by
going
out
of
their
way
to
seek
it
ordinary
people
are
sociable
and
complaisant
just
from
the
very
opposite
feeling
to
bear
company
is
easier
for
them
than
to
bear
their
own
moreover
respect
is
not
paid
in
this
world
to
that
which
has
real
merit
it
is
reserved
for
that
which
has
none
so
retirement
is
at
once
a
proof
and
a
result
of
being
distinguished
by
the
possession
of
meritorious
qualities
it
will
therefore
show
real
wisdom
on
the
part
of
any
one
who
is
worth
anything
in
himself
to
limit
his
requirements
as
may
be
necessary
in
order
to
preserve
or
extend
his
freedom
and
since
a
man
must
come
into
some
relations
with
his
to
admit
them
to
his
intimacy
as
little
as
possible
footnote
ii
i
have
said
that
people
are
rendered
sociable
by
their
ability
to
endure
solitude
that
is
to
say
their
own
society
they
become
sick
of
themselves
it
is
this
vacuity
of
soul
which
drives
them
to
intercourse
with
others
to
travels
in
foreign
countries
their
mind
is
wanting
in
elasticity
it
has
no
movement
of
its
own
and
so
they
try
to
give
it
some
by
drink
for
instance
how
much
drunkenness
is
due
to
this
cause
alone
they
are
always
looking
for
some
form
of
excitement
of
the
strongest
kind
they
can
bear
the
excitement
of
being
with
people
of
like
nature
with
themselves
and
if
they
fail
in
this
their
mind
sinks
by
its
own
weight
and
they
fall
into
a
grievous
lethargy
such
people
it
may
be
said
possess
only
a
small
fraction
of
humanity
in
themselves
and
it
requires
a
great
many
of
them
put
together
to
make
up
a
fair
amount
of
it
to
attain
any
degree
of
consciousness
as
men
a
man
in
the
full
sense
of
the
word
a
man
does
not
represent
a
fraction
but
a
whole
number
he
is
complete
in
himself
footnote
it
is
a
fact
that
we
can
more
easily
bear
up
under
evils
which
fall
upon
a
great
many
people
besides
ourselves
as
boredom
seems
to
be
an
evil
of
this
kind
people
band
together
to
offer
it
a
common
resistance
the
love
of
life
is
at
bottom
only
the
fear
of
death
and
in
the
same
way
the
social
impulse
does
not
rest
directly
upon
the
love
of
society
but
upon
the
fear
of
solitude
it
is
not
alone
the
charm
of
being
in
others
company
that
people
seek
it
is
the
dreary
oppression
of
being
alone
the
monotony
of
their
own
consciousness
that
they
would
avoid
they
will
do
anything
to
escape
it
even
tolerate
bad
companions
and
put
up
with
the
feeling
of
constraint
which
all
society
involves
in
this
case
a
very
burdensome
one
but
if
aversion
to
such
society
conquers
the
aversion
to
being
alone
they
become
accustomed
to
solitude
and
hardened
to
its
immediate
effects
they
no
longer
find
solitude
to
be
such
a
very
bad
thing
and
settle
down
comfortably
to
it
without
any
hankering
after
society
and
this
partly
because
it
is
only
indirectly
that
they
need
others
company
and
partly
because
they
have
become
accustomed
to
the
benefits
of
being
alone
ordinary
society
is
in
this
respect
very
like
the
kind
of
music
to
be
obtained
from
an
orchestra
composed
of
russian
horns
each
horn
has
only
one
note
and
the
music
is
produced
by
each
note
coming
in
just
at
the
right
moment
in
the
monotonous
sound
of
a
single
horn
you
have
a
precise
illustration
of
the
effect
of
most
people
minds
how
often
there
seems
to
be
only
one
thought
there
and
no
room
for
any
other
it
is
easy
to
see
why
people
are
so
bored
and
also
why
they
are
sociable
why
they
like
to
go
about
in
crowds
why
mankind
is
so
it
is
the
monotony
of
his
own
nature
that
makes
a
man
find
solitude
intolerable
stultitia
laborat
fastidio
folly
is
truly
its
own
burden
put
a
great
many
men
together
and
you
may
get
some
result
some
music
from
your
horns
a
man
of
intellect
is
like
an
artist
who
gives
a
concert
without
any
help
from
anyone
else
playing
on
a
single
instrument
a
piano
say
which
is
a
little
orchestra
in
itself
such
a
man
is
a
little
world
in
himself
and
the
effect
produced
by
various
instruments
together
he
produces
in
the
unity
of
his
own
consciousness
like
the
piano
he
has
no
place
in
a
symphony
he
is
a
soloist
and
performs
by
himself
in
solitude
it
may
be
or
if
in
company
with
other
instruments
only
as
principal
or
for
setting
the
tone
as
in
singing
however
those
who
are
fond
of
society
from
time
to
time
may
profit
by
this
simile
and
lay
it
down
as
a
general
rule
that
deficiency
of
quality
in
those
we
meet
may
be
to
some
extent
compensated
by
an
increase
in
quantity
one
man
company
may
be
quite
enough
if
he
is
clever
but
where
you
have
only
ordinary
people
to
deal
with
it
is
advisable
to
have
a
great
many
of
them
so
that
some
advantage
may
accrue
by
letting
them
all
work
together
on
the
analogy
of
the
horns
and
may
heaven
grant
you
patience
for
your
task
that
mental
vacuity
and
barrenness
of
soul
to
which
i
have
alluded
is
responsible
for
another
misfortune
when
men
of
the
better
class
form
a
society
for
promoting
some
noble
or
ideal
aim
the
result
almost
always
is
that
the
innumerable
mob
of
humanity
comes
crowding
in
too
as
it
always
does
everywhere
like
vermin
their
object
being
to
try
and
get
rid
of
boredom
or
some
other
defect
of
their
nature
and
anything
that
will
effect
that
they
seize
upon
at
once
without
the
slightest
discrimination
some
of
them
will
slip
into
that
society
or
push
themselves
in
and
then
either
soon
destroy
it
altogether
or
alter
it
so
much
that
in
the
end
it
comes
to
have
a
purpose
the
exact
opposite
of
that
which
it
had
at
first
this
is
not
the
only
point
of
view
from
which
the
social
impulse
may
be
regarded
on
cold
days
people
manage
to
get
some
warmth
by
crowding
together
and
you
can
warm
your
mind
in
the
same
way
by
bringing
it
into
contact
with
others
but
a
man
who
has
a
great
deal
of
intellectual
warmth
in
himself
will
stand
in
no
need
of
such
resources
i
have
written
a
little
fable
illustrating
this
it
may
be
found
elsewhere
as
a
general
rule
it
may
be
said
that
a
sociability
stands
very
nearly
in
inverse
ratio
to
his
intellectual
value
to
say
that
so
and
so
is
very
unsociable
is
almost
tantamount
to
saying
that
he
is
a
man
of
great
capacity
footnote
the
passage
to
which
schopenhauer
refers
is
vol
ii
edition
the
fable
is
of
certain
porcupines
who
huddled
together
for
warmth
on
a
cold
day
but
as
they
began
to
prick
one
another
with
their
quills
they
were
obliged
to
disperse
however
the
cold
drove
them
together
again
when
just
the
same
thing
happened
at
last
after
many
turns
of
huddling
and
dispersing
they
discovered
that
they
would
be
best
off
by
remaining
at
a
little
distance
from
one
another
in
the
same
way
the
need
of
society
drives
the
human
porcupines
together
only
to
be
mutually
repelled
by
the
many
prickly
and
disagreeable
qualities
of
their
nature
the
moderate
distance
which
they
at
last
discover
to
be
the
only
tolerable
condition
of
intercourse
is
the
code
of
politeness
and
fine
manners
and
those
who
transgress
it
are
roughly
told
in
the
english
phrase
keep
their
by
this
arrangement
the
mutual
need
of
warmth
is
only
very
moderately
satisfied
but
then
people
do
not
get
pricked
a
man
who
has
some
heat
in
himself
prefers
to
remain
outside
where
he
will
neither
prick
other
people
nor
get
pricked
himself
solitude
is
doubly
advantageous
to
such
a
man
firstly
it
allows
him
to
be
with
himself
and
secondly
it
prevents
him
being
with
others
an
advantage
of
great
moment
for
how
much
constraint
annoyance
and
even
danger
there
is
in
all
intercourse
with
the
world
notre
says
la
bruyère
de
ne
pouvoir
être
it
is
really
a
very
risky
nay
a
fatal
thing
to
be
sociable
because
it
means
contact
with
natures
the
great
majority
of
which
are
bad
morally
and
dull
or
perverse
intellectually
to
be
unsociable
is
not
to
care
about
such
people
and
to
have
enough
in
oneself
to
dispense
with
the
necessity
of
their
company
is
a
great
piece
of
good
fortune
because
almost
all
our
sufferings
spring
from
having
to
do
with
other
people
and
that
destroys
the
peace
of
mind
which
as
i
have
said
comes
next
after
health
in
the
elements
of
happiness
peace
of
mind
is
impossible
without
a
considerable
amount
of
solitude
the
cynics
renounced
all
private
property
in
order
to
attain
the
bliss
of
having
nothing
to
trouble
them
and
to
renounce
society
with
the
same
object
is
the
wisest
thing
a
man
can
do

the
very
excellent
and
pertinent
remark
that
to
be
sparing
in
regard
to
food
is
a
means
of
health
in
regard
to
society
a
means
of
tranquillity

la

de
to
be
soon
on
friendly
or
even
affectionate
terms
with
solitude
is
like
winning
a
gold
mine
but
this
is
not
something
which
everybody
can
do
the
prime
reason
for
social
intercourse
is
mutual
need
and
as
soon
as
that
is
satisfied
boredom
drives
people
together
once
more
if
it
were
not
for
these
two
reasons
a
man
would
probably
elect
to
remain
alone
if
only
because
solitude
is
the
sole
condition
of
life
which
gives
full
play
to
that
feeling
of
exclusive
importance
which
every
man
has
in
his
own
eyes
as
if
he
were
the
only
person
in
the
world
a
feeling
which
in
the
throng
and
press
of
real
life
soon
shrivels
up
to
nothing
getting
at
every
step
a
painful
from
this
point
of
view
it
may
be
said
that
solitude
is
the
original
and
natural
state
of
man
where
like
another
adam
he
is
as
happy
as
his
nature
will
allow
but
still
had
adam
no
father
or
mother
there
is
another
sense
in
which
solitude
is
not
the
natural
state
for
at
his
entrance
into
the
world
a
man
finds
himself
with
parents
brothers
sisters
that
is
to
say
in
society
and
not
alone
accordingly
it
can
not
be
said
that
the
love
of
solitude
is
an
original
characteristic
of
human
nature
it
is
rather
the
result
of
experience
and
reflection
and
these
in
their
turn
depend
upon
the
development
of
intellectual
power
and
increase
with
the
years
speaking
generally
sociability
stands
in
inverse
ratio
with
age
a
little
child
raises
a
piteous
cry
of
fright
if
it
is
left
alone
for
only
a
few
minutes
and
later
on
to
be
shut
up
by
itself
is
a
great
punishment
young
people
soon
get
on
very
friendly
terms
with
one
another
it
is
only
the
few
among
them
of
any
nobility
of
mind
who
are
glad
now
and
then
to
be
alone
but
to
spend
the
whole
day
thus
would
be
disagreeable
a
man
can
easily
do
it
it
is
little
trouble
to
him
to
be
much
alone
and
it
becomes
less
and
less
trouble
as
he
advances
in
years
an
old
man
who
has
outlived
all
his
friends
and
is
either
indifferent
or
dead
to
the
pleasures
of
life
is
in
his
proper
element
in
solitude
and
in
individual
cases
the
special
tendency
to
retirement
and
seclusion
will
always
be
in
direct
proportion
to
intellectual
capacity
for
this
tendency
is
not
as
i
have
said
a
purely
natural
one
it
does
not
come
into
existence
as
a
direct
need
of
human
nature
it
is
rather
the
effect
of
the
experience
we
go
through
the
product
of
reflection
upon
what
our
needs
really
are
proceeding
more
especially
from
the
insight
we
attain
into
the
wretched
stuff
of
which
most
people
are
made
whether
you
look
at
their
morals
or
their
intellects
the
worst
of
it
all
is
that
in
the
individual
moral
and
intellectual
shortcomings
are
closely
connected
and
play
into
each
other
hands
so
that
all
manner
of
disagreeable
results
are
obtained
which
make
intercourse
with
most
people
not
only
unpleasant
but
intolerable
hence
though
the
world
contains
many
things
which
are
thoroughly
bad
the
worst
thing
in
it
is
society
even

that

to
admit

what

an
aristocratic
feeling
that
is
at

propensity

seclusion

solitude

the

sign

has
any
nobility
in

the
little
pleasure
he
takes
in

company
he
prefers
solitude
more
and
more
and
in
course
of
time
comes
to
see
that
with
few
exceptions
the
world
offers
no
choice
beyond
solitude
on
one
side
and
vulgarity
on
the
other

may
sound
a
hard
thing
to
say

even
angelus

his

to
admit
the

it

may

is
natural
for

to
care
little
about

little
as

for

the

of
these

is
to
guide
mankind
over
the
sea
of
error

the

truth
to
draw
it
forth
from
the
dark
abysses
of
a
barbarous
vulgarity
up
into
the
light
of
culture
and
refinement
men
of
great
intellect
live
in
the
world
without
really
belonging
to
it
and
so
from
their
earliest
years
they
feel
that
there
is
a
perceptible
difference
between
them
and
other
people
but
it
is
only
gradually
with
the
lapse
of
years
that
they
come
to
a
clear
understanding
of
their
position
their
intellectual
isolation
is
then
reinforced
by
actual
seclusion
in
their
manner
of
life
they
let
no
one
approach
who
is
not
in
some
degree
emancipated
from
the
prevailing
vulgarity
from
what
has
been
said
it
is
obvious
that
the
love
of
solitude
is
not
a
direct
original
impulse
in
human
nature
but
rather
something
secondary
and
of
gradual
growth
it
is
the
more
distinguishing
feature
of
nobler
minds
developed
not
without
some
conquest
of
natural
desires
and
now
and
then
in
actual
opposition
to
the
promptings
of
mephistopheles
bidding
you
exchange
a
morose
and
solitude

up

looks
upon

and
then
the
years
pass
more

as
we
become
older
and
we
want
to
devote
our
remaining

to
the

rather
than
to
the

side
of

more
than

to
us
to
pursue

of

thousand
things
become
clear
which
were
formerly
enveloped
in
obscurity
and
results
are
obtained
which
give
a
feeling
of
difficulties
overcome
from
long
experience
of
men
we
cease
to
expect
much
from
them
we
find
that
on
the
whole
people
do
not
gain
by
a
nearer
acquaintance
and
that
apart
from
a
few
rare
and
fortunate
exceptions
we
have
come
across
none
but
defective
specimens
of
human
nature
which
it
is
advisable
to
leave
in
peace
we
are
no
more
subject
to
the
ordinary
illusions
of
life
and
as
in
individual
instances
we
soon
see
what
a
man
is
made
of
we
seldom
feel
any
inclination
to
come
into
closer
relations
with
him
finally
isolation
our
own
society
has
become
a
habit
as
it
were
a
second
nature
to
us

especially
if
we
have
been
on
friendly
terms
with
it
from
our
youth
up
the
love
of
solitude
which
was
formerly
indulged
only
at
the
expense
of
our
desire
for
society
has
now
come
to
be
the
simple
quality
of
our
natural
disposition
the
element
proper
to
our
life
as
water
to
a
fish
this
is
why
anyone
who
possesses
a
unique
individuality
unlike
others
and
therefore
necessarily
isolated
feels
that
as
he
becomes
older
his
position
is
no
longer
so
burdensome
as
when
he
was
young
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
very
genuine
privilege
of
old
age
is
one
which
can
be
enjoyed
only
if
a
man
is
possessed
of
a
certain
amount
of
intellect
it
will
be
appreciated
most
of
all
where
there
is
real
mental
power
but
in
some
degree
by
every
one
it
is
only
people
of
very
barren
and
vulgar
nature
who
will
be
just
as
sociable
in
their
old
age
as
they
were
in
their
youth
but
then
they
become
troublesome
to
a
society
to
which
they
are
no
longer
suited
and
at
most
manage
to
be
tolerated
whereas
they
were
formerly
in
great
request
there
is
another
aspect
of
this
inverse
proportion
between
age
and
sociability
the
way
in
which
it
conduces
to
education
the
younger
that
people
are
the
more
in
every
respect
they
have
to
learn
and
it
is
just
in
youth
that
nature
provides
a
system
of
mutual
education
so
that
mere
intercourse
with
others
at
that
time
of
life
carries
instruction
with
it
human
society
from
this
point
of
view
resembles
a
huge
academy
of
learning
on
the
bell
and
lancaster
system
opposed
to
the
system
of
education
by
means
of
books
and
schools
as
something
artificial
and
contrary
to
the
institutions
of
nature
it
is
therefore
a
very
suitable
arrangement
that
in
his
young
days
a
man
should
be
a
very
diligent
student
at
the
place
of
learning
provided
by
nature
herself
but
there
is
nothing
in
life
which
has
not
some
drawback
est
ab
omni
parte
as
horace
says
or
in
the
words
of
an
indian
proverb
lotus
without
a
seclusion
which
has
so
many
advantages
has
also
its
little
annoyances
and
drawbacks
which
are
small
however
in
comparison
with
those
of
society
hence
anyone
who
is
worth
much
in
himself
will
get
on
better
without
other
people
than
with
them
but
amongst
the
disadvantages
of
seclusion
there
is
one
which
is
not
so
easy
to
see
as
the
rest
it
is
this
when
people
remain
indoors
all
day
they
become
physically
very
sensitive
to
atmospheric
changes
so
that
every
little
draught
is
enough
to
make
them
ill
so
with
our
temper
a
long
course
of
seclusion
makes
it
so
sensitive
that
the
most
trivial
incidents
words
or
even
looks
are
sufficient
to
disturb
or
to
vex
and
offend
us
little
things
which
are
unnoticed
by
those
who
live
in
the
turmoil
of
life
when
you
find
human
society
disagreeable
and
feel
yourself
justified
in
flying
to
solitude
you
can
be
so
constituted
as
to
be
unable
to
bear
the
depression
of
it
for
any
length
of
time
which
will
probably
be
the
case
if
you
are
young
let
me
advise
you
then
to
form
the
habit
of
taking
some
of
your
solitude
with
you
into
society
to
learn
to
be
to
some
extent
alone
even
though
you
are
in
company
not
to
say
at
once
what
you
think
and
on
the
other
hand
not
to
attach
too
precise
a
meaning
to
what
others
say
rather
not
to
expect
much
of
them
either
morally
or
intellectually
and
to
strengthen
yourself
in
the
feeling
of
indifference
to
their
opinion
which
is
the
surest
way
of
always
practicing
a
praiseworthy
toleration
if
you
do
that
you
will
not
live
so
much
with
other
people
though
you
may
appear
to
move
amongst
them
your
relation
to
them
will
be
of
a
purely
objective
character
this
precaution
will
keep
you
from
too
close
contact
with
society
and
therefore
secure
you
against
being
contaminated
or
even
outraged
by
it
society
is
in
this
respect
like
a
fire
the
wise
man
warming
himself
at
a
proper
distance
from
it
not
coming
too
close
like
the
fool
who
on
getting
scorched
runs
away
and
shivers
in
solitude
loud
in
his
complaint
that
the
fire
burns
footnote
this
restricted
or
as
it
were
entrenched
kind
of
sociability
has
been
dramatically
illustrated
in

play

worth
reading

so
much

the
envy
which
we
may
feel
towards

as
regards
the
envy
which
we
may
excite
in

should
always
be
remembered
that
no
form
of
hatred
is
so
implacable
as
the
hatred
that
comes
from

therefore
we
should
always
carefully
refrain
from
doing
anything
to
rouse

as
with
many
another

of

is
better
altogether
to
renounce

pleasure

kinds

of

of

envious
persons
if
you
belong
to
one
of

will
be
secretly
embittered
against

unless

are
restrained
by

they
will
always
be
anxious
to
let
you
understand
that
are
no

than
it

by
their
anxiety
to
let
you
know
this
that
they
betray
how
greatly
they
are
conscious
that
the
opposite
is
the
truth
the
line
of
conduct
to
be
pursued
if
you
are
exposed
to
envy
is
to
keep
the
envious
persons
at
a
distance
and
as
far
as
possible
avoid
all
contact
with

so
that
there
may
be

the

thing

provokes

also
neutralize

what
appears
to
be
generally
done
the
members
of
one
of
these
aristocracies
usually
get
on
very
well
with
those
of
another
and
there
is
no
call
for
envy
between
them

their

privileges
effect
an
equipoise

give
mature
and
repeated
consideration
to
any
plan
before
you
proceed
to
carry
it
out
and
even
after
you
have
thoroughly
turned
it
over
in
your
mind
make
some
concession
to
the
incompetency
of
human
judgment
for
it
may
always
happen
that
circumstances
which
can
not
be
investigated
or
foreseen
will
come
in
and
upset
the
whole

your

refrain
from
unnecessary
action

matters

you
must

may
be
observed
in
passing
that
a

translations
from
the

fail

is
a
saying

the
blame

had
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
effort
people
make
as
far
as
possible
to
conceal
their
misfortunes
and
to
put
the
best
face
they
can
upon
them

are

blame

reflections

you
are

for

you

the
great
truth
revealed
to
you
that
everything
which
happens
is
the
result
of
necessity
and
therefore
inevitable
however
good
this
advice
may
be
it
is
and
partial
in
relieving
and
quieting
us
for
the
moment
it
is
no
doubt
effective
enough
but
when
our
misfortunes
have
resulted
as
is
usually
the
case
from
our
own
carelessness
or
folly
or
at
any
rate
partly
by
our
own
fault
it
is
a
good
thing
to
consider
how
they
might
have
been
avoided
and
to
consider
it
often
in
spite
of
its
being
a
tender
subject
a
salutary
form
of
which
will
make
us
wiser
and
better
men
for
the
future
if
we
have
made
obvious
mistakes
we
should
not
try
as
we
generally
do
to
gloss
them
over
or
to
find
something
to
excuse
or
extenuate
them
we
should
admit
to
ourselves
that
we
have
committed
faults
and
open
our
eyes
wide
to
all
their
enormity
in
order
that
we
may
firmly
resolve
to
avoid
them
in
time
to
come
to
be
sure
that
means
a
great
deal
of
pain
in

in

affecting

we
should
be
careful
not
to
let
our
imagination
run
away
with
us
and
build
no
castles
in
the

in
the
first
place
they
are
expensive
to
build
because
we
have
to
pull
them
down
again
immediately
and
that
is
a
source
of
grief
we
should
be
still
more
on
our
guard
against
distressing
our
hearts
by
depicting
possible
misfortunes
if
these
were
misfortunes
of
a
purely
imaginary
kind
or
very
remote
and
unlikely
we
should
at
once
see
on
awaking
from
our
dream
that
the
whole
thing
was
mere
illusion
we
should
rejoice
all
the
more
in
a
reality
better
than
our
dreams
or
at
most
be
warned
against
misfortunes
which
though
very
remote
were
still
possible
these
however
are
not
the
sort
of
playthings
in
which
imagination
delights
it
is
only
in
idle
hours
that
we
build
castles
in
the
air
and
they
are
always
of
a
pleasing
description
the
matter
which
goes
to
form
gloomy
dreams
are
mischances
which
to
some
extent
really
threaten
us
though
it
be
from
some
distance
imagination
makes
us
look
larger
and
nearer
and
more
terrible
than
they
are
in
reality
this
is
a
kind
of
dream
which
can
not
be
so
readily
shaken
off
on
awaking
as
a
pleasant
one
for
a
pleasant
dream
is
soon
dispelled
by
reality
leaving
at
most
a
feeble
hope
lying
in
the
lap
of
possibility
once
we
have
abandoned
ourselves
to
a
fit
of
the
blues
visions
are
conjured
up
which
do
not
so
easily
vanish
again
for
it
is
always
just
possible
that
the
visions
may
be
realized
but
we
are
not
always
able
to
estimate
the
exact
degree
of
possibility
possibility
may
easily
pass
into
probability
and
thus
we
deliver
ourselves
up
to
torture
therefore
we
should
be
careful
not
to
be
on
any
matter
affecting
our
weal
or
our
woe
not
to
carry
our
anxiety
to
unreasonable
or
injudicious
limits
but
coolly
and
dispassionately
to
deliberate
upon
the
matter
as
though
it
were
an
abstract
question
which
did
not
touch
us
in
particular
we
should
give
no
play
to
imagination
here
for
imagination
is
not
judgment
it
only
conjures
up
visions
inducing
an
unprofitable
and
often
very
painful
mood
the
rule
on
which
i
am
here
insisting
should
be
most
carefully
observed
towards
evening
for
as
darkness
makes
us
timid
and
apt
to
see
terrifying
shapes
everywhere
there
is
something
similar
in
the
effect
of
indistinct
thought
and
uncertainty
always
brings
with
it
a
sense
of
danger
hence
towards
evening
when
our
powers
of
thought
and
judgment
are
relaxed
at
the
hour
as
it
were
of
subjective
darkness
the
intellect
becomes
tired
easily
confused
and
unable
to
get
at
the
bottom
of
things
and
if
in
that
state
we
meditate
on
matters
of
personal
interest
to
ourselves
they
soon
assume
a
dangerous
and
terrifying
aspect
this
is
mostly
the
case
at
night
when
we
are
in
bed
for
then
the
mind
is
fully
relaxed
and
the
power
of
judgment
quite
unequal
to
its
duties
but
imagination
is
still
awake
night
gives
a
black
look
to
everything
whatever
it
may
be
this
is
why
our
thoughts
just
before
we
go
to
sleep
or
as
we
lie
awake
through
the
hours
of
the
night
are
usually
such
confusions
and
perversions
of
facts
as
dreams
themselves
and
when
our
thoughts
at
that
time
are
concentrated
upon
our
own
concerns
they
are
generally
as
black
and
monstrous
as
possible
in
the
morning
all
such
nightmares
vanish
like
dreams
as
the
spanish
proverb
has
it
tinta
bianco
el
the
night
is
colored
the
day
is
white
but
even
towards
nightfall
as
soon
as
the
candles
are
lit
the
mind
like
the
eye
no
longer
sees
things
so
clearly
as
by
day
it
is
a
time
unsuited
to
serious
meditation
especially
on
unpleasant
subjects
the
morning
is
the
proper
time
for
that
as
indeed
for
all
efforts
without
exception
whether
mental
or
bodily
for
the
morning
is
the
youth
of
the
day
when
everything
is
bright
fresh
and
easy
of
attainment
we
feel
strong
then
and
all
our
faculties
are
completely
at
our
disposal
do
not
shorten
the
morning
by
getting
up
late
or
waste
it
in
unworthy
occupations
or
in
talk
look
upon
it
as
the
quintessence
of
life
as
to
a
certain
extent
sacred
evening
is
like
old
age
we
are
languid
talkative
silly
each
day
is
a
little
life
every
waking
and
rising
a
little
birth
every
fresh
morning
a
little
youth
every

an

upon

hence
both
our

of
any
matter
and
our
capacity
for
any

are
very
much
subject
to

is
to
rouse
into
fresh
life
all
those
hateful
passions
long
laid
asleep
the
anger
and
resentment
which
disturb
and
pollute
our
nature
in

excellent

out
how
in

mob

vulgar

not

let
this
mob
revolt

even
so
much
as
peep
forth
from

is
hideous
of
mien
and
its
rebel
leaders
are
those
flights
of
imagination
which
i
have
been
describing
the
smallest
annoyance
whether
it
comes
from
our
or
from
the
things
around
us
may
swell
up
into
a
monster
of
dreadful
aspect
putting
us
at
our
wits
end
and
all
because
we
go
on
brooding
over
our
troubles
and
painting
them
in
the
most
glaring
colors
and
on
the
largest
scale
it
is
much
better
to
take
a
very
calm
and
prosaic
view
of
what
is
disagreeable
for
that
is
the
easiest
way
of
bearing
it
if
you
hold
small
objects
close
to
your
eyes
you
limit
your
field
of
vision
and
shut
out
the
world
and
in
the
same
way
the
people
or
the
things
which
stand
nearest
even
though
they
are
of
the
very
smallest
consequence
are
apt
to
claim
an
amount
of
attention
much
beyond
their
due
occupying
us
disagreeably
and
leaving
no
room
for
serious
thoughts
and
affairs
of
importance
we
ought
to
work
against
this
tendency
section
the
sight
of
things
which
do
not
belong
to
us
is
very
apt
to
raise
the
thought
if
that
were
only
making
us
sensible
of
our
privation
instead
of
that
we
should
do
better
by
more
frequently
putting
to
ourselves
the
opposite
case
if
that
were
not
what
i
mean
is
that
we
should
sometimes
try
to
look
upon
our
possessions
in
the
light
in
which
they
would
appear
if
we
had
lost
them
whatever
they
may
be
property
health
friends
a
wife
or
child
or
someone
else
we
love
our
horse
or
our
dog
it
is
usually
only
when
we
have
lost
them
that
we
begin
to
find
out
their
value
but
if
we
come
to
look
at
things
in
the
way
i
recommend
we
shall
be
doubly
the
gainers
we
shall
at
once
get
more
pleasure
out
of
them
than
we
did
before
and
we
shall
do
everything
in
our
power
to
prevent
the
loss
of
them
for
instance
by
not
risking
our
property
or
angering
our
friends
or
exposing
our
wives
to
temptation
or
being
careless
about
our
children
health
and
so
on
we
often
try
to
banish
the
gloom
and
despondency
of
the
present
by
speculating
upon
our
chances
of
success
in
the
future
a
process
which
leads
us
to
invent
a
great
many
chimerical
hopes
every
one
of
them
contains
the
germ
of
illusion
and
disappointment
is
inevitable
when
our
hopes
are
shattered
by
the
hard
facts
of
life
it
is
less
hurtful
to
take
the
chances
of
misfortune
as
a
theme
for
speculation
because
in
doing
so
we
provide
ourselves
at
once
with
measures
of
precaution
against
it
and
a
pleasant
surprise
when
it
fails
to
make
its
appearance
is
it
not
a
fact
that
we
always
feel
a
marked
improvement
in
our
spirits
when
we
begin
to
get
over
a
period
of
anxiety
i
may
go
further
and
say
that
there
is
some
use
in
occasionally
looking
upon
terrible
misfortunes
such
as
might
happen
to
us
as
though
they
had
actually
happened
for
then
the
trivial
reverses
which
subsequently
come
in
reality
are
much
easier
to
bear
it
is
a
source
of
consolation
to
look
back
upon
those
great
misfortunes
which
never
happened
but
in
following
out
this
rule
care
must
be
taken
not
to
neglect
what
i
have
said
in
the
preceding
section
section
the
things
which
engage
our
attention
whether
they
are
matters
of
business
or
ordinary
events
are
of
such
diverse
kinds
that
if
taken
quite
separately
and
in
no
fixed
order
or
relation
they
present
a
medley
of
the
most
glaring
contrasts
with
nothing
in
common
except
that
they
one
and
all
affect
us
in
particular
there
must
be
a
corresponding
abruptness
in
the
thoughts
and
anxieties
which
these
various
matters
arouse
in
us
if
our
thoughts
are
to
be
in
keeping
with
their
various
subjects
therefore
in
setting
about
anything
the
first
step
is
to
withdraw
our
attention
from
everything
else
this
will
enable
us
to
attend
to
each
matter
at
its
own
time
and
to
enjoy
or
put
up
with
it
quite
apart
from
any
thought
of
our
remaining
interests
our
thoughts
must
be
arranged
as
it
were
in
little
drawers
so
that
we
may
open
one
without
disturbing
any
of
the
others
in
this
way
we
can
keep
the
heavy
burden
of
anxiety
from
weighing
upon
us
so
much
as
to
spoil
the
little
pleasures
of
the
present
or
from
robbing
us
of
our
rest
otherwise
the
consideration
of
one
matter
will
interfere
with
every
other
and
attention
to
some
important
business
may
lead
us
to
neglect
many
affairs
which
happen
to
be
of
less
moment
it
is
most
important
for
everyone
who
is
capable
of
higher
and
nobler
thoughts
to
keep
their
mind
from
being
so
completely
engrossed
with
private
affairs
and
vulgar
troubles
as
to
let
them
take
up
all
his
attention
and
crowd
out
worthier
matter
for
that
is
in
a
very
real
sense
to
lose
sight
of
the
true
end
of
life
vitam
vivendi
perdere
of
course
for
this
as
for
so
much
else
is
necessary
without
it
we
can
not
manage
ourselves
in
the
way
i
have
described
and
may
not
appear
so
very
difficult
if
we
consider
that
every
man
has
to
submit
to
a
great
deal
of
very
severe
control
on
the
part
of
his
surroundings
and
that
without
it
no
form
of
existence
is
possible
further
a
little
at
the
right
moment
may
prevent
much
subsequent
compulsion
at
the
hands
of
others
just
as
a
very
small
section
of
a
circle
close
to
the
centre
may
correspond
to
a
part
near
the
circumference
a
hundred
times
as
large
nothing
will
protect
us
from
external
compulsion
so
much
as
the
control
of
ourselves
and
as
seneca
says
to
submit
yourself
to
reason
is
the
way
to
make
everything
else
submit
to
you
tibi
vis
omnia
subjicere
te
subjice
too
is
something
which
we
have
in
our
own
power
and
if
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
and
it
touches
us
in
a
very
sensitive
part
we
can
always
relax
its
severity
but
other
people
will
pay
no
regard
to
our
feelings
if
they
have
to
use
compulsion
and
we
shall
be
treated
without
pity
or
mercy
therefore
it
will
be
prudent
to
anticipate
compulsion
by
section
we
must
set
limits
to
our
wishes
curb
our
desires
moderate
our
anger
always
remembering
that
an
individual
can
attain
only
an
infinitesimal
share
in
anything
that
is
worth
having
and
that
on
the
other
hand
everyone
must
incur
many
of
the
ills
of
life
in
a
word
we
must
bear
and
forbear
et
and
if
we
fail
to
observe
this
rule
no
position
of
wealth
or
power
will
prevent
us
from
feeling
wretched
this
is
what
horace
means
when
he
recommends
us
to
study
carefully
and
inquire
diligently
what
will
best
promote
a
tranquil
life
not
to
be
always
agitated
by
fruitless
desires
and
fears
and
hopes
for
things
which
after
all
are
not
worth

much

a
man
wants
to
use
his
strength
to
see
if
he
can
what
effect
it
will
produce
and
he
will
get
the
most
complete
satisfaction
of
this
desire
if
he
can
make
or
construct
something
be
it
a
book
or
a
basket
there
is
a
direct
pleasure
in
seeing
work
grow
under
hands
day
by
day
until
at
last
it
is
finished
this
is
the
pleasure
attaching
to
a
work
of
art
or
a
manuscript
or
even
mere
manual
labor
and
of
course
the
higher
the
work
the
greater
pleasure
it
will
give
from
this
point
of
view
those
are
happiest
of
all
who
are
conscious
of
the
power
to
produce
great
works
animated
by
some
significant
purpose
it
gives
a
higher
kind
of
interest
a
sort
of
rare
flavor
to
the
whole
of
their
life
which
by
its
absence
from
the
life
of
the
ordinary
man
makes
it
in
comparison
something
very
insipid
for
richly
endowed
natures
life
and
the
world
have
a
special
interest
beyond
the
mere
everyday
personal
interest
which
so
many
others
share
and
something
higher
than
that
a
formal
interest
it
is
from
life
and
the
world
that
they
get
the
material
for
their
works
and
as
soon
as
they
are
freed
from
the
pressure
of
personal
needs
it
is
to
the
diligent
collection
of
material
that
they
devote
their
whole
existence
so
with
their
intellect
it
is
to
some
extent
of
a
character
and
devoted
partly
to
the
ordinary
affairs
of
every
day
those
matters
of
will
which
are
common
to
them
and
the
rest
of
mankind
and
partly
to
their
peculiar
work
the
pure
and
objective
contemplation
of
existence
and
while
on
the
stage
of
the
world
most
men
play
their
little
part
and
then
pass
away
the
genius
lives
a
double
life
at
once
an
actor
and
a
spectator
let
everyone
then
do
something
according
to
the
measure
of
his
capacities
to
have
no
regular
work
no
set
sphere
of
activity
what
a
miserable
thing
it
is
how
often
long
travels
undertaken
for
pleasure
make
a
man
downright
unhappy
because
the
absence
of
anything
that
can
be
called
occupation
forces
him
as
it
were
out
of
his
right
element
effort
struggles
with
difficulties
that
is
as
natural
to
a
man
as
grubbing
in
the
ground
is
to
a
mole
to
have
all
his
wants
satisfied
is
something
intolerable
the
feeling
of
stagnation
which
comes
from
pleasures
that
last
too
long
to
overcome
difficulties
is
to
experience
the
full
delight
of
existence
no
matter
where
the
obstacles
are
encountered
whether
in
the
affairs
of
life
in
commerce
or
business
or
in
mental
effort
the
spirit
of
inquiry
that
tries
to
master
its
subject
there
is
always
something
pleasurable
in
the
struggle
and
the
victory
and
if
a
man
has
no
opportunity
to
excite
himself
he
will
do
what
he
can
to
create
one
and
according
to
his
individual
bent
he
will
hunt
or
play
cup
and
ball
or
led
on
by
this
unsuspected
element
in
his
nature
he
will
pick
a
quarrel
with
some
one
or
hatch
a
plot
or
intrigue
or
take
to
swindling
and
rascally
courses
generally
all
to
put
an
end
to
a
state
of
repose
which
is
intolerable
as
i
have
remarked
in
otio
it
is
difficult
to
keep
quiet
if
you
have
nothing
to
do
section
a
man
should
avoid
being
led
on
by
the
phantoms
of
his
imagination
this
is
not
the
same
thing
as
to
submit
to
the
guidance
of
ideas
clearly
thought
out
and
yet
these
are
rules
of
life
which
most
people
pervert
if
you
examine
closely
into
the
circumstances
which
in
any
deliberation
ultimately
turn
the
scale
in
favor
of
some
particular
course
you
will
generally
find
that
the
decision
is
influenced
not
by
any
clear
arrangement
of
ideas
leading
to
a
formal
judgment
but
by
some
fanciful
picture
which
seems
to
stand
for
one
of
the
alternatives
in
question
in
one
of
voltaire
or
diderot
romances
i
forget
the
precise
reference
the
hero
standing
like
a
young
hercules
at
the
parting
of
ways
can
see
no
other
representation
of
virtue
than
his
old
tutor
holding
a
in
his
left
hand
from
which
he
takes
a
pinch
and
moralizes
whilst
vice
appears
in
the
shape
of
his
chambermaid
it
is
in
youth
more
especially
that
the
goal
of
our
efforts
comes
to
be
a
fanciful
picture
of
happiness
which
continues
to
hover
before
our
eyes
sometimes
for
half
and
even
for
the
whole
of
our
life
a
sort
of
mocking
spirit
for
when
we
think
our
dream
is
to
be
realized
the
picture
fades
away
leaving
us
the
knowledge
that
nothing
of
what
it
promised
is
actually
accomplished
how
often
this
is
so
with
the
visions
of
domesticity
the
detailed
picture
of
what
our
home
will
be
like
or
of
life
among
our
or
in
society
or
again
of
living
in
the
country
the
kind
of
house
we
shall
have
its
surroundings
the
marks
of
honor
and
respect
that
will
be
paid
to
us
and
so
on
whatever
our
hobby
may
be
fou
a
sa
it
is
often
the
same
too
with
our
dreams
about
one
we
love
and
this
is
all
quite
natural
for
the
visions
we
conjure
up
affect
us
directly
as
though
they
were
real
objects
and
so
they
exercise
a
more
immediate
influence
upon
our
will
than
an
abstract
idea
which
gives
merely
a
vague
general
outline
devoid
of
details
and
the
details
are
just
the
real
part
of
it
we
can
be
only
indirectly
affected
by
an
abstract
idea
and
yet
it
is
the
abstract
idea
alone
which
will
do
as
much
as
it
promises
and
it
is
the
function
of
education
to
teach
us
to
put
our
trust
in
it
of
course
the
abstract
idea
must
be
occasionally
explained
paraphrased
as
it
were
by
the
aid
of
pictures
but
discreetly
grano
section
the
preceding
rule
may
be
taken
as
a
special
case
of
the
more
general
maxim
that
a
man
should
never
let
himself
be
mastered
by
the
impressions
of
the
moment
or
indeed
by
outward
appearances
at
all
which
are
incomparably
more
powerful
in
their
effects
than
the
mere
play
of
thought
or
a
train
of
ideas
not
because
these
momentary
impressions
are
rich
in
virtue
of
the
data
they
supply
it
is
often
just
the
contrary
but
because
they
are
something
palpable
to
the
senses
and
direct
in
their
working
they
forcibly
invade
our
mind
disturbing
our
repose
and
shattering
our
resolutions
it
is
easy
to
understand
that
the
thing
which
lies
before
our
very
eyes
will
produce
the
whole
of
its
effect
at
once
but
that
time
and
leisure
are
necessary
for
the
working
of
thought
and
the
appreciation
of
argument
as
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
everything
at
one
and
the
same
moment
this
is
why
we
are
so
allured
by
pleasure
in
spite
of
all
our
determination
to
resist
it
or
so
much
annoyed
by
a
criticism
even
though
we
know
that
its
author
it
totally
incompetent
to
judge
or
so
irritated
by
an
insult
though
it
comes
from
some
very
contemptible
quarter
in
the
same
way
to
mention
no
other
instances
ten
reasons
for
thinking
that
there
is
no
danger
may
be
outweighed
by
one
mistaken
notion
that
it
is
actually
at
hand
all
this
shows
the
radical
unreason
of
human
nature
women
frequently
succumb
altogether
to
this
predominating
influence
of
present
impressions
and
there
are
few
men
so
overweighted
with
reason
as
to
escape
suffering
from
a
similar
cause
if
it
is
impossible
to
resist
the
effects
of
some
external
influence
by
the
mere
play
of
thought
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
neutralize
it
by
some
contrary
influence
for
example
the
effect
of
an
insult
may
be
overcome
by
seeking
the
society
of
those
who
have
a
good
opinion
of
us
and
the
unpleasant
sensation
of
imminent
danger
may
be
avoided
by
fixing
our
attention
on
the
means
of
warding
it

section
in
the
first
part
of
this
work
i
have
insisted
upon
the
great
value
of
as
the
chief
and
most
important
element
in
happiness
let
me
emphasize
and
confirm
what
i
have
there
said
by
giving
a
few
general
rules
as
to
its
preservation
the
way
to
harden
the
body
is
to
impose
a
great
deal
of
labor
and
effort
upon
it
in
the
days
of
good
health
to
exercise
it
both
as
a
whole
and
in
its
several
parts
and
to
habituate
it
to
withstand
all
kinds
of
noxious
influences
but
on
the
appearance
of
an
illness
or
disorder
either
in
the
body
as
a
whole
or
in
many
of
its
parts
a
contrary
course
should
be
taken
and
every
means
used
to
nurse
the
body
or
the
part
of
it
which
is
affected
and
to
spare
it
any
effort
for
what
is
ailing
and
debilitated
can
not
be
hardened
the
muscles
may
be
strengthened
by
a
vigorous
use
of
them
but
not
so
the
nerves
they
are
weakened
by
it
therefore
while
exercising
the
muscles
in
every
way
that
is
suitable
care
should
be
taken
to
spare
the
nerves
as
much
as
possible
the
eyes
for
instance
should
be
protected
from
too
strong
a
light
especially
when
it
is
reflected
light
from
any
straining
of
them
in
the
dark
or
from
the
examination
of
minute
objects
and
the
ears
from
too
loud
sounds
above
all
the
brain
should
never
be
forced
or
used
too
much
or
at
the
wrong
time
let
it
have
a
rest
during
digestion
for
then
the
same
vital
energy
which
forms
thoughts
in
the
brain
has
a
great
deal
of
work
to
do
elsewhere
i
mean
in
the
digestive
organs
where
it
prepares
chyme
and
chyle
for
similar
reasons
the
brain
should
never
be
used
during
or
immediately
after
violent
muscular
exercise
for
the
motor
nerves
are
in
this
respect
on
a
par
with
the
sensory
nerves
the
pain
felt
when
a
limb
is
wounded
has
its
seat
in
the
brain
and
in
the
same
way
it
is
not
really
our
legs
and
arms
which
work
and
move
it
is
the
brain
or
more
strictly
that
part
of
it
which
through
the
medium
of
the
spine
excites
the
nerves
in
the
limbs
and
sets
them
in
motion
accordingly
when
our
arms
and
legs
feel
tired
the
true
seat
of
this
feeling
is
in
the
brain
this
is
why
it
is
only
in
connection
with
those
muscles
which
are
set
in
motion
consciously
and
voluntarily
in
other
words
depend
for
their
action
upon
the
brain
that
any
feeling
of
fatigue
can
arise
this
is
not
the
case
with
those
muscles
which
work
involuntarily
like
the
heart
it
is
obvious
then
that
injury
is
done
to
the
brain
if
violent
muscular
exercise
and
intellectual
exertion
are
forced
upon
it
at
the
same
moment
or
at
very
short
intervals
what
i
say
stands
in
no
contradiction
with
the
fact
that
at
the
beginning
of
a
walk
or
at
any
period
of
a
short
stroll
there
often
comes
a
feeling
of
enhanced
intellectual
vigor
the
parts
of
the
brain
that
come
into
play
have
had
no
time
to
become
tired
and
besides
slight
muscular
exercise
conduces
to
activity
of
the
respiratory
organs
and
causes
a
purer
and
more
oxydated
supply
of
arterial
blood
to
mount
to
the
brain
it
is
most
important
to
allow
the
brain
the
full
measure
of
sleep
which
is
required
to
restore
it
for
sleep
is
to
a
man
whole
nature
what
winding
up
is
to
a
clock
this
measure
will
vary
directly
with
the
development
and
activity
of
the
brain
to
overstep
the
measure
is
mere
waste
of
time
because
if
that
is
done
sleep
gains
only
so
much
in
length
as
it
loses
in
depth

we

which

the
higher
the
rate

and
the
more
regularly
it
is
paid
the
further
the
date
of
redemption
is
postponed
it
should
be
clearly
understood
that
thought
is
nothing
but
the
organic
function
of
the
brain
and
it
has
to
obey
the
same
laws
in
regard
to
exertion
and
repose
as
any
other
organic
function
the
brain
can
be
ruined
by
overstrain
just
like
the
eyes
as
the
function
of
the
stomach
is
to
digest
so
it
is
that
of
the
brain
to
think
the
notion
of
a
as
something
elementary
and
immaterial
merely
lodging
in
the
brain
and
needing
nothing
at
all
for
the
performance
of
its
essential
function
which
consists
in
always
and
unweariedly
has
undoubtedly
driven
many
people
to
foolish
practices
leading
to
a
deadening
of
the
intellectual
powers
frederick
the
great
even
once
tried
to
form
the
habit
of
doing
without
sleep
altogether
it
would
be
well
if
professors
of
philosophy
refrained
from
giving
currency
to
a
notion
which
is
attended
by
practical
results
of
a
pernicious
character
but
then
this
is
just
what
professorial
philosophy
does
in
its
endeavor
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
the
catechism
a
man
should
accustom
himself
to
view
his
intellectual
capacities
in
no
other
light
than
that
of
physiological
functions
and
to
manage
them
accordingly
nursing
or
exercising
them
as
the
case
may
be
remembering
that
every
kind
of
physical
suffering
malady
or
disorder
in
whatever
part
of
the
body
it
occurs
has
its
effect
upon
the
mind
the
best
advice
that
i
know
on
this
subject
is
given
by
cabanis
in
his

the
work
to
which
schopenhauer
here
refers
is
a
series
of
essays
by
cabanis
a
french
philosopher
treating
of
mental
and
moral
phenomena
on
a
physiological
basis
in
his
later
days
cabanis
completely
abandoned
his
materialistic
standpoint
through
neglect
of
this
rule
many
men
of
genius
and
great
scholars
have
become
and
childish
or
even
gone
quite
mad
as
they
grew
old
to
take
no
other
instances
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
celebrated
english
poets
of
the
early
part
of
this
century
scott
wordsworth
southey
became
intellectually
dull
and
incapable
towards
the
end
of
their
days
nay
soon
after
passing
their
sixtieth
year
and
that
their
imbecility
can
be
traced
to
the
fact
that
at
that
period
of
life
they
were
all
led
on
by
the
promise
of
high
pay
to
treat
literature
as
a
trade
and
to
write
for
money
this
seduced
them
into
an
unnatural
abuse
of
their
intellectual
powers
and
a
man
who
puts
his
pegasus
into
harness
and
urges
on
his
muse
with
the
whip
will
have
to
pay
a
penalty
similar
to
that
which
is
exacted
by
the
abuse
of
other
kinds
of
power
and
even
in
the
case
of
kant
i
suspect
that
the
second
childhood
of
his
last
four
years
was
due
to
overwork
in
later
life
and
after
he
had
succeeded
in
becoming

do
two

to
look

to
overlook

protect

the
other
from
disputes

no

has
to
live
amongst
men
should
absolutely
discard
any
person
who
has
his
due
place
in
the
order
of
nature
even
though
he
is
very
wicked
or
contemptible
or
ridiculous
he
must
accept
him
as
an
unalterable

unalterable

the

if

as
to
condemn
a
man
from
every
point
of

there
will
be
nothing
left
him
but
to
engage
us
in
deadly
conflict
for
we
are
practically
allowing
him

to
exist
only
on

that
he
becomes

which

his

so
if
you
have
to
live
amongst
men
you
must
allow
everyone
the
right
to
exist
in
accordance
with
the
character
he
has
whatever
it
turns
out
to
be
and
all
you
should
strive
to
do
is
to
make
use
of
this
character
in
such
a
way
as
its
kind
and
nature
permit
rather
than
to
hope
for
any
alteration
in
it
or
to
condemn
it
for
what
it
is
this
is
the
true
sense
of
the
maxim
live
and
let
live
that
however
is
a
task
which
is
difficult
in
proportion
as
it
is
right
and
he
is
a
happy
man
who
can
once
for
all
avoid
having
to
do
with
a
great
many
of
his
fellow
creatures
the
art
of
putting
up
with
people
may
be
learned
by
practicing
patience
on
inanimate
objects
which
in
virtue
of
some
mechanical
or
general
physical
necessity
oppose
a
stubborn
resistance
to
our
freedom
of
action
a
form
of
patience
which
is
required
every
day
the
patience
thus
gained
may
be
applied
to
our
dealings
with
men
by
accustoming
ourselves
to
regard
their
opposition
wherever
we
encounter
it
as
the
inevitable
outcome
of
their
nature
which
sets
itself
up
against
us
in
virtue
of
the
same
rigid
law
of
necessity
as
governs
the
resistance
of
inanimate
objects
to
become
indignant
at
their
conduct
is
as
foolish
as
to
be
angry
with
a
stone
because
it
rolls
into
your
path
and
with
many
people
the
wisest
thing
you
can
do
is
to
resolve
to
make
use
of
those
whom
you
can
not
alter
section
it
is
astonishing
how
easily
and
how
quickly
similarity
or
difference
of
mind
and
disposition
makes
itself
felt
between
one
man
and
another
as
soon
as
they
begin
to
talk
every
little
trifle
shows
it
when
two
people
of
totally
different
natures
are
conversing
almost
everything
said
by
the
one
will
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
displease
the
other
and
in
many
cases
produce
positive
annoyance
even
though
the
conversation
turn
upon
the
most
subject
or
one
in
which
neither
of
the
parties
has
any
real
interest
people
of
similar
nature
on
the
other
hand
immediately
come
to
feel
a
kind
of
general
agreement
and
if
they
are
cast
very
much
in
the
same
mould
complete
harmony
or
even
unison
will
flow
from
their
intercourse
this
explain
two
circumstances
first
of
all
it
shows
why
it
is
that
common
ordinary
people
are
so
sociable
and
find
good
company
wherever
they
go
ah
those
good
dear
brave
people
it
is
just
the
contrary
with
those
who
are
not
of
the
common
run
and
the
less
they
are
so
the
more
unsociable
they
become
so
that
if
in
their
isolation
they
chance
to
come
across
some
one
in
whose
nature
they
can
find
even
a
single
sympathetic
chord
be
it
never
so
minute
they
show
extraordinary
pleasure
in
his
society
for
one
man
can
be
to
another
only
so
much
as
the
other
is
to
him
great
minds
are
like
eagles
and
build
their
nest
in
some
lofty
solitude
secondly
we
are
enabled
to
understand
how
it
is
that
people
of
like
disposition
so
quickly
get
on
with
one
another
as
though
they
were
drawn
together
by
magnetic
force
kindred
souls
greeting
each
other
from
afar
of
course
the
most
frequent
opportunity
of
observing
this
is
afforded
by
people
of
vulgar
tastes
and
inferior
intellect
but
only
because
their
name
is
legion
while
those
who
are
better
off
in
this
respect
and
of
a
rarer
nature
are
not
often
to
be
met
with
they
are
called
rare
because
you
can
seldom
find
them
take
the
case
of
a
large
number
of
people
who
have
formed
themselves
into
a
league
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
some
practical
object
if
there
be
two
rascals
among
them
they
will
recognize
each
other
as
readily
as
if
they
bore
a
similar
badge
and
will
at
once
conspire
for
some
misfeasance
or
treachery
in
the
same
way
if
you
can
imagine
a
large
company
of
very
intelligent
and
clever
people
amongst
whom
there
are
only
two
blockheads
these
two
will
be
sure
to
be
drawn
together
by
a
feeling
of
sympathy
and
each
of
them
will
very
soon
secretly
rejoice
at
having
found
at
least
one
intelligent
person
in
the
whole
company
it
is
really
quite
curious
to
see
how
two
such
men
especially
if
they
are
morally
and
intellectually
of
an
inferior
type
will
recognize
each
other
at
first
sight
with
what
zeal
they
will
strive
to
become
intimate
how
affably
and
cheerily
they
will
run
to
greet
each
other
just
as
though
they
were
old
friends
it
is
all
so
striking
that
one
is
tempted
to
embrace
the
buddhist
doctrine
of
metempsychosis
and
presume
that
they
were
on
familiar
terms
in
some
former
state
of
existence
still
in
spite
of
all
this
general
agreement
men
are
kept
apart
who
might
come
together
or
in
some
cases
a
passing
discord
springs
up
between
them
this
is
due
to
diversity
of
mood
you
will
hardly
ever
see
two
people
exactly
in
the
same
frame
of
mind
for
that
is
something
which
varies
with
their
condition
of
life
occupation
surroundings
health
the
train
of
thought
they
are
in
at
the
moment
and
so
on
these
differences
give
rise
to
discord
between
persons
of
the
most
harmonious
disposition
to
correct
the
balance
properly
so
as
to
remove
the
disturbance
to
introduce
as
it
were
a
uniform
temperature
is
a
work
demanding
a
very
high
degree
of
culture
the
extent
to
which
uniformity
of
mood
is
productive
of
may
be
measured
by
its
effects
upon
a
large
company
when
for
instance
a
great
many
people
are
gathered
together
and
presented
with
some
objective
interest
which
works
upon
all
alike
and
influences
them
in
a
similar
way
no
matter
what
it
be
a
common
danger
or
hope
some
great
news
a
spectacle
a
play
a
piece
of
music
or
anything
of
that
kind
you
will
find
them
roused
to
a
mutual
expression
of
thought
and
a
display
of
sincere
interest
there
will
be
a
general
feeling
of
pleasure
amongst
them
for
that
which
attracts
their
attention
produces
a
unity
of
mood
by
overpowering
all
private
and
personal
interests
and
in
default
of
some
objective
interest
of
the
kind
i
have
mentioned
recourse
is
usually
had
to
something
subjective
a
bottle
of
wine
is
not
an
uncommon
means
of
introducing
a
mutual
feeling
of
fellowship
and
even
tea
and
coffee
are
used
for
a
like
end
the
discord
which
so
easily
finds
its
way
into
all
society
as
an
effect
of
the
different
moods
in
which
people
happen
to
be
for
the
moment
also
in
part
explains
why
it
is
that
memory
always
idealizes
and
sometimes
almost
transfigures
the
attitude
we
have
taken
up
at
any
period
of
the
past
a
change
due
to
our
inability
to
remember
all
the
fleeting
influences
which
disturbed
us
on
any
given
occasion
memory
is
in
this
respect
like
the
lens
of
a
it
contracts
everything
within
its
range
and
so
produces
a
much
finer
picture
than
the
actual
landscape
affords
and
in
the
case
of
a
man
absence
always
goes
some
way
towards
securing
this
advantageous
light
for
though
the
idealizing
tendency
of
the
memory
requires
times
to
complete
its
work
it
begins
it
at
once
hence
it
is
a
prudent
thing
to
see
your
friends
and
acquaintances
only
at
considerable
intervals
of
time
and
on
meeting
them
again
you
will
observe
that
memory
has
been
at
work
section
no
man
can
see
his
own
let
me
explain
what
i
mean
you
can
not
see
in
another
man
any
more
than
you
have
in
yourself
and
your
own
intelligence
strictly
determines
the
extent
to
which
he
comes
within
its
grasp
if
your
intelligence
is
of
a
very
low
order
mental
qualities
in
another
even
though
they
be
of
the
highest
kind
will
have
no
effect
at
all
upon
you
you
will
see
nothing
in
their
possessor
except
the
meanest
side
of
his
individuality
in
other
words
just
those
parts
of
his
character
and
disposition
which
are
weak
and
defective
your
whole
estimate
of
the
man
will
be
confined
to
his
defects
and
his
higher
mental
qualities
will
no
more
exist
for
you
than
colors
exist
for
those
who
can
not
see
intellect
is
invisible
to
the
man
who
has
none
in
any
attempt
to
criticise
another
work
the
range
of
knowledge
possessed
by
the
critic
is
as
essential
a
part
of
his
verdict
as
the
claims
of
the
work
itself
hence
intercourse
with
others
involves
a
process
of
leveling
down
the
qualities
which
are
present
in
one
man
and
absent
in
another
can
not
come
into
play
when
they
meet
and
the
which
this
entails
upon
one
of
the
parties
calls
forth
no
recognition
from
the
other
consider
how
sordid
how
stupid
in
a
word
how
most
men
are
and
you
will
see
that
it
is
impossible
to
talk
to
them
without
becoming
vulgar
yourself
for
the
time
being
vulgarity
is
in
this
respect
like
electricity
it
is
easily
distributed
you
will
then
fully
appreciate
the
truth
and
propriety
of
the
expression
make
yourself
and
you
will
be
glad
to
avoid
the
society
of
people
whose
only
possible
point
of
contact
with
you
is
just
that
part
of
your
nature
of
which
you
have
least
reason
to
be
proud
so
you
will
see
that
in
dealing
with
fools
and
blockheads
there
is
only
one
way
of
showing
your
intelligence
by
having
nothing
to
do
with
them
that
means
of
course
that
when
you
go
into
society
you
may
now
and
then
feel
like
a
good
dancer

la

the
striking
remark
that
it
is
difficult
to
feel
deep
veneration
and
great
affection
for
one
and
the

person
if
this
is
so

shall
have
to
choose
whether
it
is
veneration

love

we
want

their
love
is
always
selfish
though
in
very
different
ways
and
the
means
used
to
gain
it
are
not
always
of
a
kind
to
make
us
proud
a
man
is
loved
by
others
mainly
in
the
degree
in
which
he
moderates
his
claim
on
their
good
feeling
and
intelligence
but
he
must
act
genuinely
in
the
matter
and
without
dissimulation
not
merely
out
of
forbearance
which
is
at
bottom
a
kind
of
contempt
this
calls
to
mind
a
very
true
observation
of
helvetius
amount
of
intellect
necessary
to
please
us
is
a
most
accurate
measure
of
the
amount
of
intellect
we
have
with
these
remarks
as
premises
it
is
easy
to
draw
the
conclusion
footnote
helvetius
a
french
philosophical
writer
much
esteemed
by
schopenhauer
his
chief
work
excited
great
interest
and
opposition
at
the
time
of
its
publication
on
account
of
the
author
pronounced
materialism
now
with
veneration
the
case
is
just
the
opposite
it
is
wrung
from
men
reluctantly
and
for
that
very
reason
mostly
concealed
hence
as
compared
with
love
veneration
gives
more
real
satisfaction
for
it
is
connected
with
personal
value
and
the
same
is
not
directly
true
of
love
which
is
subjective
in
its
nature
whilst
veneration
is
objective
to
be
sure
it
is
more
useful
to
be
loved
than
to
be
venerated
section
most
men
are
so
thoroughly
subjective
that
nothing
really
interests
them
but
themselves
they
always
think
of
their
own
case
as
soon
as
ever
any
remark
is
made

their
whole

is
engrossed

absorbed
by
the
merest
chance
reference

anything

the
result
that
they
have
no
power
left

forming

objective
view

things

the
conversation
take
that
turn
neither
can
they
admit
any
validity
in
arguments
which
tell
against
their
interest
or
their
vanity
hence
their
attention
is
easily
distracted
they
are
so
readily
offended
insulted
or
annoyed
that
in
discussing
any
impersonal
matter
with

no

true
and
striking
observations
fine
subtle
and
witty
things
are
lost
upon
them
they
can
not
understand
or
feel
them
but
anything
that
disturbs
their
petty
vanity
in
the
most
remote
and
indirect
way
or
reflects
prejudicially
upon
their
exceedingly
precious
selves
to
that
they
are
most
tenderly
sensitive
in
this
respect
they
are
like
the
little
dog
whose
toes
you
are
so
apt
to
tread
upon
inadvertently
you
know
it
by
the
shrill
bark
it
sets
up
or
again
they
resemble
a
sick
man
covered
with
sores
and
boils
with
whom
the
greatest
care
must
be
taken
to
avoid
unnecessary
handling
and
in
some
people
this
feeling
reaches
such
a
pass
that
if
they
are
talking
with
anyone
and
he
exhibits
or
does
not
sufficiently
conceal
his
intelligence
and
discernment
they
look
upon
it
as
a
downright
insult
although
for
the
moment
they
hide
their
ill
will
and
the
unsuspecting
author
of
it
afterwards
ruminates
in
vain
upon
their
conduct
and
racks
his
brain
to
discover
what
he
could
possibly
have
done
to
excite
their
malice
and
hatred
but
it
is
just
as
easy
to
flatter
and
win
them
over
and
this
is
why
their
judgment
is
usually
corrupt
and
why
their
opinions
are
swayed
not
by
what
is
really
true
and
right
but
by
the
favor
of
the
party
or
class
to
which
they
belong
and
the
ultimate
reason
of
it
all
is
that
in
such
people
force
of
will
greatly
predominates
over
knowledge
and
hence
their
meagre
intellect
is
wholly
given
up
to
the
service
of
the
will
and
can
never
free
itself
from
that
service
for
a
moment
astrology
furnishes
a
magnificent
proof
of
this
miserable

any

statement
is
made
whether
in
public
or
in
society
or
in
books
and
well

or
at
any
rate
not

that
that
is
no
reason
why
you
should
despair
or
think
there
the
matter
will
rest
you
should
comfort
yourself
with
the
reflection
that
the
question
will
be
afterwards
gradually
subjected
to
examination
light
will
be
thrown
upon
it
it
will
be
thought
over
considered
discussed
and
generally
in
the
end
the
correct
view
will
be
reached
so
that
after
a
time
the
length
of
which
will
depend
upon
the
difficulty
of
the
subject
everyone
will
come
to
understand
that
which
a
clear
head
saw
at
once
in
the
meantime
of
course
you
must
have
patience
he
who
can
see
truly
in
the
midst
of
general
infatuation
is
like
a
man
whose
watch
keeps
good
time
when
all
clocks
in
the
town
in
which
he
lives
are
wrong
he
alone
knows
the
right
time
but
what
use
is
that
to
him
for
everyone
goes
by
the
clocks
which
speak
false
not
even
excepting
those
who
know
that
his
watch
is
the
only
one
that
is
right
section
men
are
like
children
in
that
if
you
spoil
them
they
become
naughty
therefore
it
is
well
not
to
be
too
indulgent
or
charitable
with
anyone
you
may
take
it
as
a
general
rule
that
you
will
not
lose
a
friend
by
refusing
him
a
loan
but
that
you
are
very
likely
to
do
so
by
granting
it
and
for
similar
reasons
you
will
not
readily
alienate
people
by
being
somewhat
proud
and
careless
in
your
behaviour
but
if
you
are
very
kind
and
complaisant
towards
them
you
will
often
make
them
arrogant
and
intolerable
and
so
a
breach
will
ensue
there
is
one
thing
that
more
than
any
other
throws
people
absolutely
off
their
balance
the
thought
that
you
are
dependent
upon
them
this
is
sure
to
produce
an
insolent
and
domineering
manner
towards
you
there
are
some
people
indeed
who
become
rude
if
you
enter
into
any
kind
of
relation
with
them
for
instance
if
you
have
occasion
to
converse
with
them
frequently
upon
confidential
matters
they
soon
come
to
fancy
that
they
can
take
liberties
with
you
and
so
they
try
and
transgress
the
laws
of
politeness
this
is
why
there
are
so
few
with
whom
you
care
to
become
more
intimate
and
why
you
should
avoid
familiarity
with
vulgar
people
if
a
man
comes
to
think
that
i
am
more
dependent
upon
him
than
he
is
upon
me
he
at
once
feels
as
though
i
had
stolen
something
from
him
and
his
endeavor
will
be
to
have
his
vengeance
and
get
it
back
the
only
way
to
attain
superiority
in
dealing
with
men
is
to
let
it
be
seen
that
you
are
independent
of
them
and
in
this
view
it
is
advisable
to
let
everyone
of
your
acquaintance
whether
man
or
woman
feel
now
and
then
that
you
could
very
well
dispense
with
their
company
this
will
consolidate
friendship
nay
with
most
people
there
will
be
no
harm
in
occasionally
mixing
a
grain
of
disdain
with
your
treatment
of
them
that
will
make
them
value
your
friendship
all
the
more
non
istima
vien
as
a
subtle
italian
proverb
has
it
to
disregard
is
to
win
regard
but
if
we
really
think
very
highly
of
a
person
we
should
conceal
it
from
him
like
a
crime
this
is
not
a
very
gratifying
thing
to
do
but
it
is
right
why
a
dog
will
not
bear
being
treated
too
kindly
let
alone
a
man
section
it
is
often
the
case
that
people
of
noble
character
and
great
mental
gifts
betray
a
strange
lack
of
worldly
wisdom
and
a
deficiency
in
the
knowledge
of
men
more
especially
when
they
are
young
with
the
result
that
it
is
easy
to
deceive
or
mislead
them
and
that
on
the
other
hand
natures
of
the
commoner
sort
are
more
ready
and
successful
in
making
their
way
in
the
world
the
reason
of
this
is
that
when
a
man
has
little
or
no
experience
he
must
judge
by
his
own
antecedent
notions
and
in
matters
demanding
judgment
an
antecedent
notion
is
never
on
the
same
level
as
experience
for
with
the
commoner
sort
of
people
an
antecedent
notion
means
just
their
own
selfish
point
of
view
this
is
not
the
case
with
those
whose
mind
and
character
are
above
the
ordinary
for
it
is
precisely
in
this
respect
their
unselfishness
that
they
differ
from
the
rest
of
mankind
and
as
they
judge
other
people
thoughts
and
actions
by
their
own
high
standard
the
result
does
not
always
tally
with
their
calculation
but
if
in
the
end
a
man
of
noble
character
comes
to
see
as
the
effect
of
his
own
experience
or
by
the
lessons
he
learns
from
others
what
it
is
that
may
be
expected
of
men
in
general
namely
that
of
them
are
morally
and
intellectually
so
constituted
that
if
circumstances
do
not
place
you
in
relation
with
them
you
had
better
get
out
of
their
way
and
keep
as
far
as
possible
from
having
anything
to
do
with
them
still
he
will
scarcely
ever
attain
an
adequate
notion
of
their
wretchedly
mean
and
shabby
nature
all
his
life
long
he
will
have
to
be
extending
and
adding
to
the
inferior
estimate
he
forms
of
them
and
in
the
meantime
he
will
commit
a
great
many
mistakes
and
do
himself
harm
then
again
after
he
has
really
taken
to
heart
the
lessons
that
have
been
taught
him
it
will
occasionally
happen
that
when
he
is
in
the
society
of
people
whom
he
does
not
know
he
will
be
surprised
to
find
how
thoroughly
reasonable
they
all
appear
to
be
both
in
their
conversation
and
in
their
demeanor
in
fact
quite
honest
sincere
virtuous
and
trustworthy
people
and
at
the
same
time
shrewd
and
clever
but
that
ought
not
to
perplex
him
nature
is
not
like
those
bad
poets
who
in
setting
a
fool
or
a
knave
before
us
do
their
work
so
clumsily
and
with
such
evident
design
that
you
might
almost
fancy
you
saw
the
poet
standing
behind
each
of
his
characters
and
continually
disavowing
their
sentiments
and
telling
you
in
a
tone
of
warning
is
a
knave
that
is
a
fool
do
not
mind
what
he
but
nature
goes
to
work
like
shakespeare
and
goethe
poets
who
make
every
one
of
their
characters
even
if
it
is
the
devil
himself
appear
to
be
quite
in
the
right
for
the
moment
that
they
come
before
us
in
their
several
parts
the
characters
are
described
so
objectively
that
they
excite
our
interest
and
compel
us
to
sympathize
with
their
point
of
view
for
like
the
works
of
nature
every
one
of
these
characters
is
evolved
as
the
result
of
some
hidden
law
or
principle
which
makes
all
they
say
and
do
appear
natural
and
therefore
necessary
and
you
will
always
be
the
prey
or
the
plaything
of
the
devils
and
fools
in
this
world
if
you
expect
to
see
them
going
about
with
horns
or
jangling
their
bells
and
it
should
be
borne
in
mind
that
in
their
intercourse
with
others
people
are
like
the
moon
or
like
hunchbacks
they
show
you
only
one
of
their
sides
every
man
has
an
innate
talent
for
mimicry
for
making
a
mask
out
of
his
physiognomy
so
that
he
can
always
look
as
if
he
really
were
what
he
pretends
to
be
and
since
he
makes
his
calculations
always
within
the
lines
of
his
individual
nature
the
appearance
he
puts
on
suits
him
to
a
nicety
and
its
effect
is
extremely
deceptive
he
dons
his
mask
whenever
his
object
is
to
flatter
himself
into
some
one
good
opinion
and
you
may
pay
just
as
much
attention
to
it
as
if
it
were
made
of
wax
or
cardboard
never
forgetting
that
excellent
italian
proverb
é
si
tristo
cane
che
non
meni
la
there
is
no
dog
so
bad
but
that
he
will
wag
his
tail
in
any
case
it
is
well
to
take
care
not
to
form
a
highly
favorable
opinion
of
a
person
whose
acquaintance
you
have
only
recently
made
for
otherwise
you
are
very
likely
to
be
disappointed
and
then
you
will
be
ashamed
of
yourself
and
perhaps
even
suffer
some
injury
and
while
i
am
on
the
subject
there
is
another
fact
that
deserves
mention
it
is
this
a
man
shows
his
character
just
in
the
way
in
which
he
deals
with
trifles
for
then
he
is
off
his
guard
this
will
often
afford
a
good
opportunity
of
observing
the
boundless
egoism
of
man
nature
and
his
total
lack
of
consideration
for
others
and
if
these
defects
show
themselves
in
small
things
or
merely
in
his
general
demeanor
you
will
find
that
they
also
underlie
his
action
in
matters
of
importance
although
he
may
disguise
the
fact
this
is
an
opportunity
which
should
not
be
missed
if
in
the
little
affairs
of
every
day
the
trifles
of
life
those
matters
to
which
the
rule
minimis
applies
a
man
is
inconsiderate
and
seeks
only
what
is
advantageous
or
convenient
to
himself
to
the
prejudice
of
rights
if
he
appropriates
to
himself
that
which
belongs
to
all
alike
you
may
be
sure
there
is
no
justice
in
his
heart
and
that
he
would
be
a
scoundrel
on
a
wholesale
scale
only
that
law
and
compulsion
bind
his
hands
do
not
trust
him
beyond
your
door
he
who
is
not
afraid
to
break
the
laws
of
his
own
private
circle
will
break
those
of
the
state
when
he
can
do
so
with
impunity
if
the
average
man
were
so
constituted
that
the
good
in
him
outweighed
the
bad
it
would
be
more
advisable
to
rely
upon
his
sense
of
justice
fairness
gratitude
fidelity
love
or
compassion
than
to
work
upon
his
fears
but
as
the
contrary
is
the
case
and
it
is
the
bad
that
outweighs
the
good
the
opposite
course
is
the
more
prudent
one
if
any
person
with
whom
we
are
associated
or
have
to
do
exhibits
unpleasant
or
annoying
qualities
we
have
only
to
ask
ourselves
whether
or
not
this
person
is
of
so
much
value
to
us
that
we
can
put
up
with
frequent
and
repeated
exhibitions
of
the
same
qualities
in
a
somewhat
aggravated
form
in
case
of
an
affirmative
answer
to
this
question
there
will
not
be
much
to
be
said
because
talking
is
very
little
use
we
must
let
the
matter
pass
with
or
without
some
notice
but
we
should
nevertheless
remember
that
we
are
thereby
exposing
ourselves
to
a
repetition
of
the
offence
if
the
answer
is
in
the
negative
we
must
break
with
our
worthy
friend
at
once
and
forever
or
in
the
case
of
a
servant
dismiss
him
for
he
will
inevitably
repeat
the
offence
or
do
something
tantamount
to
it
should
the
occasion
return
even
though
for
the
moment
he
is
deep
and
sincere
in
his
assurances
of
the
contrary
there
is
nothing
absolutely
nothing
that
a
man
can
not
forget
but
not
his
own
for
character
is
incorrigible
because
all
a
man
actions
emanate
from
an
inward
principle
in
virtue
of
which
he
must
always
do
the
same
thing
under
like
circumstances
and
he
can
not
do
otherwise
let
me
refer
to
my
prize
essay
on
the
of
the
the
perusal
of
which
will
dissipate
any
delusions
the
reader
may
have
on
this
subject
footnote
to
and
means
to
throw
away
dearly
bought
experience
to
become
reconciled
to
a
friend
with
whom
you
have
broken
is
a
form
of
weakness
and
you
pay
the
penalty
of
it
when
he
takes
the
first
opportunity
of
doing
precisely
the
very
thing
which
brought
about
the
breach
nay
he
does
it
the
more
boldly
because
he
is
secretly
conscious
that
you
can
not
get
on
without
him
this
is
also
applicable
to
servants
whom
you
have
dismissed
and
then
taken
into
your
service
again
for
the
same
reason
you
should
just
as
little
expect
people
to
continue
to
act
in
a
similar
way
under
altered
circumstances
the
truth
is
that
men
alter
their
demeanor
and
sentiments
just
as
fast
as
their
interest
changes
and
their
resign
in
this
respect
is
a
bill
drawn
for
short
payment
that
the
man
must
be
still
more
who
accepts
the
bill
without
protesting
it
accordingly
suppose
you
want
to
know
how
a
man
will
behave
in
an
office
into
which
you
think
of
putting
him
you
should
not
build
upon
expectations
on
his
promises
or
assurances
for
even
allowing
that
he
is
quite
sincere
he
is
speaking
about
a
matter
of
which
he
has
no
knowledge
the
only
way
to
calculate
how
he
will
behave
is
to
consider
the
circumstances
in
which
he
will
be
placed
and
the
extent
to
which
they
will
conflict
with
his
character
if
you
wish
to
get
a
clear
and
profound
insight
and
it
is
very
needful
into
the
true
but
melancholy
elements
of
which
most
men
are
made
you
will
find
in
a
very
instructive
thing
to
take
the
way
they
behave
in
the
pages
of
literature
as
a
commentary
to
their
doings
in
practical
life
and
the
experience
thus
gained
will
be
very
useful
in
avoiding
wrong
ideas
whether
about
yourself
or
about
others
but
if
you
come
across
any
special
trait
of
meanness
or
stupidity
in
life
or
in
literature
you
must
be
careful
not
to
let
it
annoy
or
distress
you
but
to
look
upon
it
merely
as
an
addition
to
your
knowledge
a
new
fact
to
be
considered
in
studying
the
character
of
humanity
your
attitude
towards
it
will
be
that
of
the
mineralogist
who
stumbles
upon
a
very
characteristic
specimen
of
a
mineral
of
course
there
are
some
facts
which
are
very
exceptional
and
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
they
arise
and
how
it
is
that
there
come
to
be
such
enormous
differences
between
man
and
man
but
in
general
what
was
said
long
ago
is
quite
true
and
the
world
is
in
a
very
bad
way
in
savage
countries
they
eat
one
another
in
civilized
they
deceive
one
another
and
that
is
what
people
call
the
way
of
the
world
what
are
states
and
all
the
elaborate
systems
of
political
machinery
and
the
rule
of
force
whether
in
home
or
in
foreign
affairs
what
are
they
but
barriers
against
the
boundless
iniquity
of
mankind
does
not
all
history
show
that
whenever
a
king
is
firmly
planted
on
a
throne
and
his
people
reach
some
degree
of
prosperity
he
uses
it
to
lead
his
army
like
a
band
of
robbers
against
adjoining
countries
are
not
almost
all
wars
ultimately
undertaken
for
purposes
of
plunder
in
the
most
remote
antiquity
and
to
some
extent
also
in
the
middle
ages
the
conquered
became
slaves
in
other
words
they
had
to
work
for
those
who
conquered
them
and
where
is
the
difference
between
that
and

represent
the
product
of
our
previous
work
all
war
says
voltaire

a
matter
of
robbery

the
germans
should
take
that
as
a
warning
section
no
man

formed
that
he
can
be
left
entirely

himself
to
go
his

everyone

a
preconceived
plan
and
to
follow
certain
general
rules

if
this
is
carried
too
far
and

to
take
on
a
character
which
is
not
natural
or
innate
in
him
but
it
artificially
acquired
and
evolved
merely
by
a
process
of
reasoning
he
will
very
soon
discover
that
nature
can
not
be
forced
and
that
if
you
drive
it
out
it
will
return
despite
your
efforts

to

still
very
soon
afterwards
the
rule
may
be
broken
in
practice
but
that
is
no
reason
for
despair
and
you
need
not
fancy
that
as
it
is
impossible
to
regulate
your
life
in
accordance
with
abstract
ideas
and
maxims
it
is
better
to
live
just
as
you
please
here
as
in
all
theoretical
instruction
that
aims
at
a
practical
result
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
understand
the
rule
the
second
thing
is
to
learn
the
practice

be

at

an
effort

yet
the
practice
of
it
acquired
only
in

of
time
a
pupil
may
lean
the
various
notes
on
an
instrument
of
music
or
the
different
position
in
fencing
and
when
he
makes
a
mistake
as
he
is
sure
to
do
however
hard
he
tries
he
is
apt
to
think
it
will
be
impossible
to
observe
the
rules
when
he
is
set
to
read
music
at
sight
or
challenged
to
a
furious
duel
but
for
all
that
gradual
practice
makes
him
perfect
through
a
long
series
of
slips
blunders
and
fresh
efforts
it
is
just
the
same
in
other
things
in
learning
to
write
and
speak
latin
a
man
will
forget
the
grammatical
rules
it
is
only
by
long
practice
that
a
blockhead
turns
into
a
courtier
that
a
passionate
man
becomes
shrewd
and
or
a
frank
person
reserved
or
a
noble
person
ironical
but
though
of
this
kind
is
the
result
of
long
habit
it
always
works
by
a
sort
of
external
compulsion
which
nature
never
ceases
to
resist
and
sometimes
unexpectedly
overcomes
the
difference
between
action
in
accordance
with
abstract
principles
and
action
as
the
result
of
original
innate
tendency
is
the
same
as
that
between
a
work
of
art
say
a
watch
where
form
and
movement
are
impressed
upon
shapeless
and
inert
matter
and
a
living
organism
where
form
and
matter
are
one
and
each
is
inseparable
from
the
other
there
is
a
maxim
attributed
to
the
emperor
napoleon
which
expresses
this
relation
between
acquired
and
innate
character
and
confirms
what
i
have
said
that
is
unnatural
is
a
rule
of
universal
application
whether
in
the
physical
or
in
the
moral
sphere

only
exception
i
can
think
of
to
this
rule
is
aventurine

the
fact
that
the

in
this
connection
let
me
utter
a
word
of
protest
against
any
and
every
form
of
it
always
arouses
contempt
in
the
first
place
because
it
argues
deception
and
the
deception
is
cowardly
for
it
is
based
on
fear
and
secondly
it
argues
because
it
means
that
a
man
is
trying
to
appear
what
he
is
not
and
therefore
something
which
he
things
better
than
he
actually
is
to
affect
a
quality
and
to
plume
yourself
upon
it
is
just
to
confess
that
you
have
not
got
it
whether
it
is
courage
or
learning
or
intellect
or
wit
or
success
with
women
or
riches
or
social
position
or
whatever
else
it
may
be
that
a
man
boasts
of
you
may
conclude
by
his
boasting
about
it
that
that
is
precisely
the
direction
in
which
he
is
rather
weak
for
if
a
man
really
possesses
any
faculty
to
the
full
it
will
not
occur
to
him
to
make
a
great
show
of
affecting
it
he
is
quite
content
to
know
that
he
has

at

no

ought
to

the
reins
go
quite
loose

show
himself
just
as
he
is
for
there
are
many
evil
and
bestial
sides
to
our
nature
which
require
to
be
hidden
away
out
of
sight
and
this
justifies
the
negative
attitude
of
dissimulation
but
it
does
not
justify
a
positive
feigning
of
qualities
which
are
not

it
should
also
be
remembered
that
affectation
is
recognized
at
once
even
before
it
is
clear
what
it
is
that
is
being
affected

finally
affectation
can

long

are
at

essentially
in

is
to

nay
most

have
no

we
find
that
a

by

a

anyone

withdraw

at

simply
that
in

than
to

such
demonstrations

true
and
genuine
friendship
presupposes
a
strong
sympathy
with
the
weal
and
woe
of
another
purely
objective
in
its
character
and
quite
disinterested
and
this
in
its
turn
means
an
absolute
identification
of
self
with
the
object
of

the
egoism
of
human
nature
is
so
strongly
antagonistic
to

belongs

no

they
are

there
is
a
grain

true

genuine

the
relation

man

though
generally
of
course
some
secret
personal
interest
is
at
the
bottom
of
them
some
one
among
the
many
forms
that
selfishness
can
take
but
in
a
world
where
all
is
imperfect
this
grain
of
true
feeling
is
such
an
ennobling
influence
that
it
gives
some
warrant
for
calling
those
relations
by
the
name
of
friendship
for
they
stand
far
above
the
ordinary
friendships
that
prevail
amongst
mankind
the
latter
are
so
constituted
that
were
you
to
hear
how
your
dear
friends
speak
of
you
behind
your
back
you
would
never
say
another
word
to
them
apart
from
the
case
where
it
would
be
a
real
help
to
you
if
your
friend
were
to
make
some
great
sacrifice
to
serve
you
there
is
no
better
means
of
testing
the
genuineness
of
his
feelings
than
the
way
in
which
he
receives
the
news
of
a
misfortune
that
has
just
happened
to
you
at
that
moment
the
expression
of
his
features
will
either
show
that
his
one
thought
is
that
of
true
and
sincere
sympathy
for
you
or
else
the
absolute
composure
of
his
countenance
or
the
passing
trace
of
something
other
than
sympathy
will
confirm

at
such
a

the

will
find
it
hard
to
suppress
the
signs
of
a
slight
smile
of
pleasure
there
are
few
ways
by
which
you
can
make
more
certain
of
putting
people
into
a
good

by
telling
them

some

has

unreservedly

of
yours

this

and
long
absence
are
always
prejudicial
to

may
be

admit
our

whom
we
do
not
see
even
though
they
be
our
dearest
friends
gradually
dries
up
in
the

years
and
they
become
abstract
notions
so
that
our
interest
in
them
grows
to
be
more

it

than
the
wise
are
indisposed
for
the
company
of
the
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
real
recommendation
to
be
stupid
for
just
as
warmth
is
agreeable
to
the
body
so
it
does
the
mind
good
to
feel
its
superiority
and
a
man
will
seek
company
likely
to
give
him
this
feeling
as
instinctively
as
he
will
approach
the
fireplace
or
walk
in
the
sun
if
he
wants
to
get
warm
but
this
means
that
he
will
be
disliked
on
account
of
his
superiority
and
if
a
man
is
to
be
liked
he
must
really
be
inferior
in
point
of
intellect
and
the
same
thing
holds
good
of
a
woman
in
point
of
beauty
to
give
proof
of
real
and
unfeigned
inferiority
to
some
of
the
people
you
meet
that
is
a
very
difficult
business
indeed
consider
how
kindly
and
heartily
a
girl
who
is
passably
pretty
will
welcome
one
who
is
downright
ugly
physical
advantages
are
not
thought
so
much
of
in
the
case
of
man
though
i
suppose
you
would
rather
a
little
man
sat
next
to
you
than
one
who
was
bigger
than
yourself
this
is
why
amongst
men
it
is
the
dull
and
ignorant
and
amongst
women
the
ugly
who
are
always
popular
and
in
request
it
is
likely
to
be
said
of
such
people
that
they
are
extremely
because
every
one
wants
to
find
a
pretext
for
caring
about
them
a
pretext
which
will
blind
both
himself
and
other
people
to
the
real
reason
why
he
likes
them
this
is
also
why
mental
superiority
of
any
sort
always
tends
to
isolate
its
possessor
people
run
away
from
him
out
of
pure
hatred
and
say
all
manner
of
bad
things
about
him
by
way
of
justifying
their
action
beauty
in
the
case
of
women
has
a
similar
effect
very
pretty
girls
have
no
friends
of
their
own
sex
and
they
even
find
it
hard
to
get
another
girl
to
keep
them
company
a
handsome
woman
should
always
avoid
applying
for
a
position
as
companion
because
the
moment
she
enters
the
room
her
prospective
mistress
will
scowl
at
her
beauty
as
a
piece
of
folly
with
which
both
for
her
own
and
for
her
daughter
sake
she
can
very
well
dispense
but
if
the
girl
has
advantages
of
rank
the
case
is
very
different
because
rank
unlike
personal
qualities
which
work
by
the
force
of
mere
contrast
produces
its
effect
by
a
process
of
reflection
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
particular
hue
of
a
person
complexion
depends
upon
the
prevailing
tone
of
his
immediate
surroundings
footnote
if
you
desire
to
get
on
in
the
world
friends
and
acquaintances
are
by
far
the
best
passport
to
fortune
the
possession
of
a
great
deal
of
ability
makes
a
man
proud
and
therefore
not
apt
to
flatter
those
who
have
very
little
and
from
whom
on
that
account
the
possession
of
great
ability
should
be
carefully
concealed
the
consciousness
of
small
intellectual
power
has
just
the
opposite
effect
and
is
very
compatible
with
a
humble
affable
and
companionable
nature
and
with
respect
for
what
is
mean
and
wretched
this
is
why
an
inferior
sort
of
man
has
so
many
friends
to
befriend
and
encourage
him
these
remarks
are
applicable
not
only
to
advancement
in
political
life
but
to
all
competition
for
places
of
honor
and
dignity
nay
even
for
reputation
in
the
world
of
science
literature
and
art
in
learned
societies
for
example
mediocrity
that
very
acceptable
quality
is
always
to
the
fore
whilst
merit
meets
with
tardy
recognition
or
with
none
at
all
so
it
is
in
everything
section
our
trust
in
other
people
often
consists
in
great
measure
of
pure
laziness
selfishness
and
vanity
on
our
own
part
i
say
because
instead
of
making
inquiries
ourselves
and
exercising
an
active
care
we
prefer
to
trust
others
because
we
are
led
to
confide
in
people
by
the
pressure
of
our
own
affairs
and
when
we
ask
confidence
for
a
matter
on
which
we
rather
pride
ourselves
and
yet
for
all
that
we
expect
people
to
be
true
to
the
trust
we
repose
in
them
but
we
ought
not
to
become
angry
if
people
put
no
trust
in
us
because
that
really
means
that
they
pay
honesty
the
sincere
compliment
of
regarding
it
as
a
very
rare
thing
so
rare
indeed
as
to
leave
us
in
doubt
whether
its
existence
is
not
merely
fabulous
section
which
the
chinese
hold
to
be
a
cardinal
virtue
is
based
upon
two
considerations
of
policy
i
have
explained
one
of
these
considerations
in
my
the
other
is
as
follows
politeness
is
a
tacit
agreement
that
people
miserable
defects
whether
moral
or
intellectual
shall
on
either
side
be
ignored
and
not
made
the
subject
of
reproach
and
since
these
defects
are
thus
rendered
somewhat
less
obtrusive
the
result
is
mutually
advantageous
footnote
in
the
passage
referred
to
grundlage
der
collected
works
vol
pp
and
schopenhauer
explains
politeness
as
a
conventional
and
systematic
attempt
to
mask
the
egoism
of
human
nature
in
the
small
affairs
of
life
an
egoism
so
repulsive
that
some
such
device
is
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
its
ugliness
the
relation
which
politeness
bears
to
the
true
love
of
one
neighbor
is
analogous
to
that
existing
between
justice
as
an
affair
of
legality
and
justice
as
the
real
integrity
of
the
heart
it
is
a
wise
thing
to
be
polite
consequently
it
is
a
stupid
thing
to
be
rude
to
make
enemies
by
unnecessary
and
willful
incivility
is
just
as
insane
a
proceeding
as
to
set
your
house
on
fire
for
politeness
is
like
a
counter
an
avowedly
false
coin
with
which
it
is
foolish
to
be
stingy
a
sensible
man
will
be
generous
in
the
use
of
it
it
is
customary
in
every
country
to
end
a
letter
with
the
words
most
obedient
devotissimo
the
germans
are
the
only
people
who
suppress
the
word
because
of
course
it
is
not
true
however
to
carry
politeness
to
such
an
extent
as
to
damage
your
prospects
is
like
giving
money
where
only
counters
are
expected
wax
a
substance
naturally
hard
and
brittle
can
be
made
soft
by
the
application
of
a
little
warmth
so
that
it
will
take
any
shape
you
please
in
the
same
way
by
being
polite
and
friendly
you
can
make
people
pliable
and
obliging
even
though
they
are
apt
to
be
crabbed
and
malevolent
hence
politeness
is
to
human
nature
what
warmth
is
to
wax
of
course
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
be
polite
in
so
far
i
mean
as
it
requires
us
to
show
great
respect
for
everybody
whereas
most
people
deserve
none
at
all
and
again
in
so
far
as
it
demands
that
we
should
feign
the
most
lively
interest
in
people
when
we
must
be
very
glad
that
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
to
combine
politeness
with
pride
is
a
masterpiece
of
wisdom
we
should
be
much
less
ready
to
lose
our
temper
over
an
insult
which
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
means
that
we
have
not
been
treated
with
respect
if
on
the
one
hand
we
have
not
such
an
exaggerated
estimate
of
our
value
and
dignity
that
is
to
say
if
we
were
not
so
immensely
proud
of
ourselves
and
on
the
other
hand
if
we
had
arrived
at
any
clear
notion
of
the
judgment
which
in
his
heart
one
man
generally
passes
upon
another

most
people
resent
the
slightest
hint

any
blame
attaches
to
them

may
imagine
their
feelings
if
they
were
to
overhear
what
their
acquaintance
say
about
them
you
should
never
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
ordinary
politeness
is
only
a
grinning
mask
if
it
shifts
its
place
a
little
or
is
removed
for
a
moment
there
is
no
use
raising
a
hue
and
cry
when
a
man
is
downright
rude
it
is
as

he
had
taken
off
all
his
clothes

stood
before
you

most
men

this
condition

not

attractive
appearance

ought
never

any
man

you
should
do

leave
undone

circumstances
are
in
no
two

show
no

acuteness

a
kind
of
algebra

which
people
are
very
proficient
give
them
a
single
fact
to
go
upon

they
will
solve
the
most
complicated
problems

if
you
wish
to
relate
some
event
that
happened
long
ago
without
mentioning
any
names
or
otherwise
indicating
the
persons
to
whom
you
refer
you
should
be
very
careful
not
to
introduce
into
your
narrative
anything
that
might
point
however
distantly

some
definite
fact

it
is
a
particular
locality

a

to

small

implicated

anything
else
that
was
even
remotely
connected

the
event

that
at
once
gives
people
something
positive
to
go
upon

by
the
aid

their
talent
for
this
sort
of
algebra
they
will
discover
all

rest

curiosity
in

a
kind

on

that

think
the
last
is
the
most
efficacious
a
man
life
is
like
the
voyage
of
a
ship
where
luck
aut

acts
the
part
of
the
wind
and
speeds
the
vessel
on
its
way
or
drives
it
far
out
of
its
course
all
that
the
man
can
do
for
himself
is
of
little

like
the
rudder
which
if
worked
hard
and
continuously
may
help
in
the
navigation
of
the
ship

yet
all
may
be
lost
again
by

if
the
wind
is
only
in
the
right
quarter
the
ship
will
sail
on
so
as
not
to
need
any
steering
the
power
of
luck
is
nowhere
better
expressed
than
in
a
certain
spanish
proverb

give
your

luck
and
throw
him
into
the
sea
still
chance
it
may
be
said
is
a
malignant
power
and
as
little
as
possible
should
be
left
to
its
agency
and
yet
where
is
there
any
giver
who
in
dispensing
gifts
tells
us
quite
clearly
that
we
have
no
right
to
them
and
that
we
owe
them
not
to
any
merit
on
our
part
but
wholly
to
the
goodness
and
grace
of
the
giver
at
the
same
time
allowing
us
to
cherish
the
joyful
hope
of
receiving
in
all
humility
further
undeserved
gifts
from
the
same
hands
where
is
there
any
giver
like
that
unless
it
be
who
understands
the
kingly
art
of
showing
the
recipient
that
all
merit
is
powerless
and
unavailing
against
the
royal
grace
and
favor
on
looking
back
over
the
course
of
his
life
that
way
of
a
man
must
see
many
points
where
luck
failed
him
and
misfortune
came
and
then
it
is
easy
to
carry
to
an
unjust
excess
for
the
course
of
a
man
life
is
in
no
wise
entirely
of
his
own
making
it
is
the
product
of
two
factors
the
series
of
things
that
happened
and
his
own
resolves
in
regard
to
them
and
these
two
are
constantly
interacting
upon
and
modifying
each
other
and
besides
these
another
influence
is
at
work
in
the
very
limited
extent
of
a
man
horizon
whether
it
is
that
he
can
not
see
very
far
ahead
in
respect
of
the
plans
he
will
adopt
or
that
he
is
still
less
able
to
predict
the
course
of
future
events
his
knowledge
is
strictly
confined
to
present
plans
and
present
events
hence
as
long
as
a
man
goal
is
far
off
he
can
not
steer
straight
for
it
he
must
be
content
to
make
a
course
that
is
approximately
right
and
in
following
the
direction
in
which
he
thinks
he
ought
to
go
he
will
often
have
occasion
to
tack
all
that
a
man
can
do
is
to
form
such
resolves
as
from
time
to
time
accord
with
the
circumstances
in
which
he
is
placed
in
the
hope
of
thus
managing
to
advance
a
step
nearer
towards
the
final
goal
it
is
usually
the
case
that
the
position
in
which
we
stand
and
the
object
at
which
we
aim
resemble
two
tendencies
working
with
dissimilar
strength
in
different
directions
and
the
course
of
our
life
is
represented
by
their
diagonal
or
resultant
force
terence

the
remark
that
life
is
like
a
game
at
dice
where
if
the
number
that
turns
up
is
not
precisely
the
one
you
want
you
can
still
contrive
to
use
it
equally

more
shortly
life

a
game
of
cards
when
the
cards
are
shuffled
and
dealt
by
fate
but
for
my
present
purpose
the
most
suitable
simile
would
be
that
of
a
game
of
chess
where
the
plan
we
determined
to
follow
is
conditioned
by
the
play
of
our
rival
in
life
by
the
caprice
of
fate
we
are
compelled
to
modify
our
tactics
often
to
such
an
extent
that
as
we
carry
them
out
hardly
a
single
feature
of
the
original
plan
can
be
recognized
footnote
he
seems
to
have
been
referring
to
a
game
something
like
backgammon
but
above
and
beyond
all
this
there
is
another
influence
that
makes
itself
felt
in
our
lives
it
is
a
trite
saying
only
too
frequently
true
that
we
are
often
more
foolish
than
we
think
on
the
other
hand
we
are
often
wiser
than
we
fancy
ourselves
to
be
this
however
is
a
discovery
which
only
those
can
make
of
whom
it
is
really
true
and
it
takes
them
a
long
time
to
make
it
our
brains
are
not
the
wisest
part
of
us
in
the
great
moments
of
life
when
a
man
decides
upon
an
important
step
his
action
is
directed
not
so
much
by
any
clear
knowledge
of
the
right
thing
to
do
as
by
an
inner
impulse
you
may
almost
call
it
an
instinct
proceeding
from
the
deepest
foundations
of
his
being
if
later
on
he
attempts
to
criticise
his
action
by
the
light
of
hard
and
fast
ideas
of
what
is
right
in
the
abstract
those
unprofitable
ideas
which
are
learnt
by
rote
or
it
may
be
borrowed
from
other
people
if
he
begins
to
apply
general
rules
the
principles
which
have
guided
others
to
his
own
case
without
sufficiently
weighing
the
maxim
that
one
man
meat
is
another
poison
then
he
will
run
great
risk
of
doing
himself
an
injustice
the
result
will
show
where
the
right
course
lay
it
is
only
when
a
man
has
reached
the
happy
age
of
wisdom
that
he
is
capable
of
just
judgment
in
regard
either
to
his
own
actions
or
to
those
of
others
it
may
be
that
this
impulse
or
instinct
is
the
unconscious
effect
of
a
kind
of
prophetic
dream
which
is
forgotten
when
we
awake
lending
our
life
a
uniformity
of
tone
a
dramatic
unity
such
as
could
never
result
from
the
unstable
moments
of
consciousness
when
we
are
so
easily
led
into
error
so
liable
to
strike
a
false
note
it
is
in
virtue
of
some
such
prophetic
dream
that
a
man
feels
himself
called
to
great
achievements
in
a
special
sphere
and
works
in
that
direction
from
his
youth
up
out
of
an
inner
and
secret
feeling
that
that
is
his
true
path
just
as
by
a
similar
instinct
the
bee
is
led
to
build
up
its
cells
in
the
comb
this
is
the
impulse
which
balthazar
gracian
calls
gran
the
great
power
of
moral
discernment
it
is
something
that
a
man
instinctively
feels
to
be
his
salvation
without
which
he
were
lost

a

formed

unawares
section
that

works
great
changes

that
all
things

these
are
truths
that
should
never

forgotten
hence
in
whatever
case
you
may
be
it
is
well
to
picture
to
yourself
the
opposite
in

to
be
mindful
of
misfortune

so

you
are
in
evil
plight
to
have
a
lively
sense
of
happier
times
what
a
lasting
source
of
true
worldly
wisdom
were
there
we
should
then
always
reflect
and
not
be
so
very
easily
deceived

in
general
we
should
anticipate
the
very
changes
that
the
years
will
bring
perhaps
in
no
form
of
knowledge
is
personal
experience
so
indispensable
as
in
learning
to
see
that
all
things
are
unstable
and
transitory
in
this
world
there
is
nothing
that
in
its
own
place
and
for
the
time
it
lasts
is
not
a
product
of
necessity
and
therefore
capable
of
being
fully
justified
and
it
is
this
fact
that
makes
circumstances
of
every
year
every
month
even
of
every
day
seem
as
though
they
might
maintain
their
right
to
last
to
all
eternity
but
we
know
that
this
can
never
be
the
case
and
that
in
a
world
where
all
is
fleeting
change
alone
endures
he
is
a
prudent
man
who
is
not
only
undeceived
by
apparent
stability

is
able
to
forecast
the
lines
upon
which
movement

footnote
plays
so
great
a
part
in
all
human
affairs
that
when
a
man
tries
to
ward
off
a
remote
danger
by
present
sacrifice
the
danger
often
vanishes
under
some
new
and
unforeseen
development
of
events
and
then
the
sacrifice
in
addition
to
being
a
complete
loss
brings
about
such
an
altered
state
of
things
as
to
be
in
itself
a
source
of
positive
danger
in
the
face
of
this
new
development
in
taking
measures
of
precaution
then
it
is
well
not
to
look
too
far
ahead
but
to
reckon
with
chance
and
often
to
oppose
a
courageous
front
to
a
danger
in
the
hope
that
like
many
a
dark
it
may
pass
away
without
breaking
but
people
generally
think
that
present
circumstances
will
last
and
that
matters
will
go
on
in
the
future
as
they
have
clone
in
the
past
their
mistakes
arises
from
the
fact
that
they
do
not
understand
the
cause
of
the
things
they
see
causes
which
unlike
the
effects
they
produce
contain
in
themselves
the
germ
of
future
change
the
effects
are
all
that
people
know
and
they
hold
fast
to
them
on
the
supposition
that
those
unknown
causes
which
were
sufficient
to
bring
them
about
will
also
be
able
to
maintain
them
as
they
are
this
is
a
very
common
error
and
the
fact
that
it
is
common
is
not
without
its
advantage
for
it
means
that
people
always
err
in
unison
and
hence
the
calamity
which
results
from
the
error
affects
all
alike
and
is
therefore
easy
to
bear
whereas
if
a
philosopher
makes
a
mistake
he
is
alone
in
his
error
and
so
at
a
double
disadvantage

remark
parenthetically
that
all
this

a
confirmation
of
the
principle
laid
down

that
error
always
consists
in
making
wrong
that
is
in
ascribing
a
given
effect
to
something
that
did
not
cause
it

in
saying
that
we

effects

should
mentally
forecast
what
they
are
likely

that
we
should
practically
forestall
them
by
demanding
the
immediate
performance
of
promises
which
time
alone
can
fulfill
the
man
who
makes
his
demand
will
find
out
that
there
is
no
worse
or

exacting
usurer
than

that
if
you
compel

to
give
money

you
will
have
to

ruinous

comes
out

strength

his

nay
it
is

of
his
very

itself
there
are
some
kinds
of
illness
in
which
entire
restoration
to
health
is
possible
only
by
letting
the
complaint
run
its
natural
course
after
which
it
disappears
without
leaving
any

of
its
existence

everything

the
difference
in
question
is
of
course
quite
natural
for
it
requires
some
amount
of
discernment

calculate
possibilities

a
man
need
only
have
his
senses
about
him
to
see
what
has
already
happened
do
not
omit
to
sacrifice
to
evil
spirits
what
i
mean
is
that
a
man
should
not
hesitate
about
spending
time
trouble
and
money
or
giving
up
his
comfort
or
restricting
his
aims

denying
himself
if
he
can
thereby
shut
the

the

whatever

you
do

and
in

it
may
be
said
that
if
a
man
takes
misfortunes
quietly
it
is
because
he
knows
that
very
many
dreadful
things
may
happen
in
the

so
he
looks
upon
the
trouble
of
the

as
only
a
very
small

that
which
might
come
this
is
the
stoic
temper
never

be

of
the
sad
fate

always
to
remember
that
our
existence
is
full
of
woe

misery

that
the
ills
to
which
we
are
exposed

innumerable
wherever
he
be
a

only
cast
a
look
around
to
revive
the
sense
of
human
misery
there
before
his
eyes
he
can
see
mankind
struggling
and
floundering
in
torment
all
for
the
sake
of
a
wretched
existence
barren
and
unprofitable
if
he
remembers
this
a
man
will
not
expect
very
much
from
life
but
learn
to
accommodate
himself
to
a
world
where
all
is
relative
and
no
perfect
state
exists
always
looking
misfortune
in

if
he

the

that
is
no

pull
a

over
the

it
is
possible
for
courage
to
be
carried
to
an
excess

to
degenerate
into
rashness
it
may
even
be
said
that
some
amount
of
fear
is
necessary
if
we
are
to
exist
at
all
in
the
world
and
cowardice
is
only
the
exaggerated
form
of
it
this
truth
has
been
very
well
expressed
by
bacon
in
his
account
of
and
the
etymological
account
which
he
gives
of
its
meaning
is
very
superior
to
the
ancient
explanation
preserved
for
us
by
plutarch
he
connects
the
expression
with
the
personification
of
nature
and
observes
that
fear
is
innate
in
every
living
thing
and
in
fact
tends
to
its
preservation
but
that
it
is
apt
to
come
into
play
without
due
cause
and
that
man
is
especially
exposed
to
it
the
chief
feature
of
this
is
that
there
is
no
clear
notion
of
any
definite
danger
bound
up
with
it
that
it
presumes
rather
than
knows
that
danger
exists
and
that
in
case
of
need
it
pleads
fright
itself
as
the
reason
for
being
afraid

is
a
very
fine
saying

the
effect
that
every
age

has
its

will
feel
completely

if
his

not

it
will
therefore
be
a
fitting
close
to
our
speculations
upon
the
nature
of
happiness
if
we
glance
at
the
chances
which
the
various
periods
of
life
produce
in
us
our
whole
life
long
it
is
and
the
present
alone
that
we
actually
possess
the
only
difference
is
that
at
the
beginning
of
life
we
look
forward
to
a
long
future
and
that
towards
the
end
we
look
back
upon
a
long
past
also
that
our
temperament
but
not
our
character
undergoes
certain
changes
which
make
wear
a
different
color
at
each
period
of
life
i
have
elsewhere
stated
that
in
childhood
we
are
more
given
to
using
our
than
our
and
i
have
explained
why
this
is
so
it
is
just
for
this
reason
that
the
first
quarter
of
life
is
so
happy
as
we
look
back
upon
it
in
after
years
it
seems
a
sort
of
lost
paradise
in
childhood
our
relations
with
others
are
limited
our
wants
are
few
in
a
word
there
is
little
stimulus
for
the
will
and
so
our
chief
concern
is
the
extension
of
our
knowledge
the
intellect
like
the
brain
which
attains
its
full
size
in
the
seventh
year
is
developed
early
though
it
takes
time
to
mature
and
it
explores
the
whole
world
of
its
surroundings
in
its
constant
search
for
nutriment
it
is
then
that
existence
is
in
itself
an
ever
fresh
delight
and
all
things
sparkle
with
the
charm
of
novelty
footnote
schopenhauer
refers
to

where
he
explains
that
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
at
that
period
of
life
the
brain
and
nervous
system
are
much
more
developed
than
any
other
part
of
the
organism
footnote
this
statement
is
not
quite
correct
the
weight
of
the
brain
increases
rapidly
up
to
the
seventh
year
more
slowly
between
the
sixteenth
and
the
twentieth
year
still
more
slowly
till
between
thirty
and
forty
years
of
age
when
it
attains
its
maximum
at
each
decennial
period
after
this
it
is
supposed
to
decrease
in
weight
on
the
average
an
ounce
for
every
ten
years
this
is
why
the
years
of
childhood
are
like
a
long
poem
for
the
function
of
poetry
as
of
all
art
is
to
grasp
the
in
the
platonic
sense
in
other
words
to
apprehend
a
particular
object
in
such
a
way
as
to
perceive
its
essential
nature
the
characteristics
it
has
in
common
with
all
other
objects
of
the
same
kind
so
that
a
single
object
appears
as
the
representative
of
a
class
and
the
results
of
one
experience
hold
good
for
a
thousand
it
may
be
thought
that
my
remarks
are
opposed
to
fact
and
that
the
child
is
never
occupied
with
anything
beyond
the
individual
objects
or
events
which
are
presented
to
it
from
time
to
time
and
then
only
in
so
far
as
they
interest
and
excite
its
will
for
the
moment
but
this
is
not
really
the
case
in
those
early
years
life
in
the
full
meaning
of
the
word
is
something
so
new
and
fresh
and
its
sensations
are
so
keen
and
unblunted
by
repetition
that
in
the
midst
of
all
its
pursuits
and
without
any
clear
consciousness
of
what
it
is
doing
the
child
is
always
silently
occupied
in
grasping
the
nature
of
life
itself
in
arriving
at
its
fundamental
character
and
general
outline
by
means
of
separate
scenes
and
experiences
or
to
use
phraseology
the
child
is
learning
to
see
the
things
and
persons
about
it
specie
as
particular
manifestations
of
universal
law
the
younger
we
are
then
the
more
does
every
individual
object
represent
for
us
the
whole
class
to
which
it
belongs
but
as
the
years
increase
this
becomes
less
and
less
the
case
that
is
the
reason
why
youthful
impressions
are
so
different
from
those
of
old
age
and
that
it
also
why
the
slight
knowledge
and
experience
gained
in
childhood
and
youth
afterwards
come
to
stand
as
the
permanent
rubric
or
heading
for
all
the
knowledge
acquired
in
later
life
those
early
forms
of
knowledge
passing
into
categories
as
it
were
under
which
the
results
of
subsequent
experience
are
classified
though
a
clear
consciousness
of
what
is
being
done
does
not
always
attend
upon
the
process
in
this
way
the
earliest
years
of
a
man
life
lay
the
foundation
of
his
view
of
the
world
whether
it
be
shallow
or
deep
and
although
this
view
may
be
extended
and
perfected
later
on
it
is
not
materially
altered
it
is
an
effect
of
this
purely
objective
and
therefore
poetical
view
of
the
world
essential
to
the
period
of
childhood
and
promoted
by
the
as
yet
undeveloped
state
of
the
volitional
energy
that
as
children
we
are
concerned
much
more
with
the
acquisition
of
pure
knowledge
than
with
exercising
the
power
of
will
hence
that
grave
fixed
look
observable
in
so
many
children
of
which
raphael
makes
such
a
happy
use
in
his
depiction
of
cherubs
especially
in
the
picture
of
the
the
years
of
childhood
are
thus
rendered
so
full
of
bliss
that
the
memory
of
them
is
always
coupled
with
longing
and
regret
while
we
thus
eagerly
apply
ourselves
to
learning
the
outward
aspect
of
things
as
the
primitive
method
of
understanding
the
objects
about
us
education
aims
at
instilling
into
us
but
ideas
furnish
no
information
as
to
the
real
and
essential
nature
of
objects
which
as
the
foundation
and
true
content
of
all
knowledge
can
be
reached
only
by
the
process
called
this
is
a
kind
of
knowledge
which
can
in
no
wise
be
instilled
into
us
from
without
we
must
arrive
at
it
by
and
for
ourselves
hence
a
man
intellectual
as
well
as
his
moral
qualities
proceed
from
the
depths
of
his
own
nature
and
are
not
the
result
of
external
influences
and
no
educational
scheme
of
pestalozzi
or
of
any
one
else
can
turn
a
born
simpleton
into
a
man
of
sense
the
thing
is
impossible
he
was
born
a
simpleton
and
a
simpleton
he
will
die
it
is
the
depth
and
intensity
of
this
early
intuitive
knowledge
of
the
external
world
that
explain
why
the
experiences
of
childhood
take
such
a
firm
hold
on
the
memory
when
we
were
young
we
were
completely
absorbed
in
our
immediate
surroundings
there
was
nothing
to
distract
our
attention
from
them
we
looked
upon
the
objects
about
us
as
though
they
were
the
only
ones
of
their
kind
as
though
indeed
nothing
else
existed
at
all
later
on
when
we
come
to
find
out
how
many
things
there
are
in
the
world
this
primitive
state
of
mind
vanishes
and
with
it
our
patience
i
have
said
elsewhere
that
the
world
considered
as
in
other
words
as
it
is
to
us
objectively
wears
in
general
a
pleasing
aspect
but
that
in
the
world
considered
as
that
is
in
regard
to
its
inner
nature
which
is
pain
and
trouble
predominate
i
may
be
allowed
to
express
the
matter
briefly
thus
world
is
glorious
to
look
at
but
dreadful

edit
to
which
the
reader
is
referred
for
a
detailed
explanation
of
my
meaning
accordingly
we
find
that
in
the
years
of
childhood
the
world
is
much
better
known
to
us
on
its
outer
or
objective
side
namely
as
the
presentation
of
will
than
on
the
side
of
its
inner
nature
namely
as
the
will
itself
since
the
objective
side
wears
a
pleasing
aspect
and
the
inner
or
subjective
side
with
its
tale
of
horror
remains
as
yet
unknown
the
youth
as
his
intelligence
develops
takes
all
the
forms
of
beauty
that
he
sees
in
nature
and
in
art
for
so
many
objects
of
blissful
existence
they
are
so
beautiful
to
the
outward
eye
that
on
their
inner
side
they
must
he
thinks
be
much
more
beautiful
still
so
the
world
lies
before
him
like
another
eden
and
this
is
the
arcadia
in
which
we
are
all
born
a
little
later
this
state
of
mind
gives
birth
to
a
thirst
for
real
life
the
impulse
to
do
and
suffer
which
drives
a
man
forth
into
the
of
the
world
there
he
learns
the
other
side
of
existence
the
inner
side
the
will
which
is
thwarted
at
every
step
then
comes
the
great
period
of
disillusion
a
period
of
very
gradual
growth
but
once
it
has
fairly
begun
a
man
will
tell
you
that
he
has
got
over
all
his
false
notions
des
illusions
est
and
yet
the
process
is
only
beginning
and
it
goes
on
extending
its
sway
and
applying
more
and
more
to
the
whole
of
life
so
it
may
be
said
that
in
childhood
life
looks
like
the
scenery
in
a
theatre
as
you
view
it
from
a
distance
and
that
in
old
age
it
is
like
the
same
scenery
when
you
come
up
quite
close
to
it
and
lastly
there
is
another
circumstance
that
contributes
to
the
happiness
of
childhood
as
spring
commences
the
young
leaves
on
the
trees
are
similar
in
color
and
much
the
same
in
shape
and
in
the
first
years
of
life
we
all
resemble
one
another
and
harmonize
very
well
but
with
puberty
divergence
begins
and
like
the
radii
of
a
circle
we
go
further
and
further
apart
the
period
of
youth
which
forms
the
remainder
of
this
earlier
half
of
our
existence
and
how
many
advantages
it
has
over
the
later
half
is
troubled
and
made
miserable
by
the
pursuit
of
happiness
as
though
there
were
no
doubt
that
it
can
be
met
with
somewhere
in
life
a
hope
that
always
ends
in
failure
and
leads
to
discontent
an
illusory
image
of
some
vague
future
bliss
born
of
a
dream
and
shaped
by
fancy
floats
before
our
eyes
and
we
search
for
the
reality
in
vain
so
it
is
that
the
young
man
is
generally
dissatisfied
with
the
position
in
which
he
finds
himself
whatever
it
may
be
he
ascribes
his
disappointment
solely
to
the
state
of
things
that
meets
him
on
his
first
introduction
to
life
when
he
had
expected
something
very
different
whereas
it
is
only
the
vanity
and
wretchedness
of
human
life
everywhere
that
he
is
now
for
the
first
time
experiencing
it
would
be
a
great
advantage
to
a
young
man
if
his
early
training
could
eradicate
the
idea
that
the
world
has
a
great
deal
to
offer
him
but
the
usual
result
of
education
is
to
strengthen
this
delusion
and
our
first
ideas
of
life
are
generally
taken
from
fiction
rather
than
from
fact
in
the
bright
dawn
of
our
youthful
days
the
poetry
of
life
spreads
out
a
gorgeous
vision
before
us
and
we
torture
ourselves
by
longing
to
see
it
realized
we
might
as
well
wish
to
grasp
the
rainbow
the
youth
expects
his
career
to
be
like
an
interesting
romance
and
there
lies
the
germ
of
that
disappointment
which
i
have
been
describing
what
lends
a
charm
to
all
these
visions
is
just
the
fact
that
they
are
visionary
and
not
real
and
that
in
contemplating
them
we
are
in
the
sphere
of
pure
knowledge
which
is
sufficient
in
itself
and
free
from
the
noise
and
struggle
of
life
to
try
and
realize
those
visions
is
to
make
them
an
object
of
a
process
which
always
involves
pain

footnote
let
me
refer
the
reader
if
he
is
interested
in
the
subject
to
the
volume
already
cited
chapter
if
the
chief
feature
of
the
earlier
half
of
life
is
a
longing
after
happiness
the
later
half
is
characterized
by
the
dread
of
misfortune
for
as
we
advance
in
years
it
becomes
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
clear
that
all
happiness
is
chimerical
in
its
nature
and
that
pain
alone
is
real
accordingly
in
later
years
we
or
at
least
the
more
prudent
amongst
us
are
more
intent
upon
eliminating
what
is
painful
from
our
lives
and
making
our
position
secure
than
on
the
pursuit
of
positive
pleasure
i
may
observe
by
the
way
that
in
old
age
we
are
better
able
to
prevent
misfortunes
from
coming
and
in
youth
better
able
to
bear
them
when
they
come
in
my
young
days
i
was
always
pleased
to
hear
a
ring
at
my
door
ah
thought
i
now
for
something
pleasant
but
in
later
life
my
feelings
on
such
occasions
were
rather
akin
to
dismay
than
to
pleasure
heaven
help
me
thought
i
what
am
i
to
do
a
similar
revulsion
of
feeling
in
regard
to
the
world
of
men
takes
place
in
all
persons
of
any
talent
or
distinction
for
that
very
reason
they
can
not
be
said
properly
to
belong
to
the
world
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
according
to
the
extent
of
their
superiority
they
stand
alone
in
their
youth
they
have
a
sense
of
being
abandoned
by
the
world
but
later
on
they
feel
as
though
they
had
escaped
it
the
earlier
feeling
is
an
unpleasant
one
and
rests
upon
ignorance
the
second
is
pleasurable
for
in
the
meantime
they
have
come
to
know
what
the
world
is
the
consequence
of
this
is
that
as
compared
with
the
earlier
the
later
half
of
life
like
the
second
part
of
a
musical
period
has
less
of
passionate
longing
and
more
restfulness
about
it
and
why
is
this
the
case
simply
because
in
youth
a
man
fancies
that
there
is
a
prodigious
amount
of
happiness
and
pleasure
to
be
had
in
the
world
only
that
it
is
difficult
to
come
by
it
whereas
when
he
becomes
old
he
knows
that
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
he
makes
his
mind
completely
at
ease
on
the
matter
enjoys
the
present
hour
as
well
as
he
can
and
even
takes
a
pleasure
in
trifles
the
chief
result
gained
by
experience
of
life
is
of
this
is
what
distinguishes
the
man
of
mature
age
and
makes
the
world
wear
such
a
different
aspect
from
that
which
it
presented
in
his
youth
or
boyhood
it
is
only
then
that
he
sees
things
quite
plain
and
takes
them
for
that
which
they
really
are
while
in
earlier
years
he
saw
a
put
together
out
of
the
whims
and
crotchets
of
his
own
mind
inherited
prejudice
and
strange
delusion
the
real
world
was
hidden
from
him
or
the
vision
of
it
distorted
the
first
thing
that
experience
finds
to
do
is
to
free
us
from
the
phantoms
of
the
brain
those
false
notions
that
have
been
put
into
us
in
youth
to
prevent
their
entrance
at
all
would
of
course
be
the
best
form
of
education
even
though
it
were
only
negative
in
aim
but
it
would
be
a
task
full
of
difficulty
at
first
the
child
horizon
would
have
to
be
limited
as
much
as
possible
and
yet
within
that
limited
sphere
none
but
clear
and
correct
notions
would
have
to
be
given
only
after
the
child
had
properly
appreciated
everything
within
it
might
the
sphere
be
gradually
enlarged
care
being
always
taken
that
nothing
was
left
obscure
or
half
or
wrongly
understood
the
consequence
of
this
training
would
be
that
the
child
notions
of
men
and
things
would
always
be
limited
and
simple
in
their
character
but
on
the
other
hand
they
would
be
clear
and
correct
and
only
need
to
be
extended
not
to
be
rectified
the
same
line
might
be
pursued
on
into
the
period
of
youth
this
method
of
education
would
lay
special
stress
upon
the
prohibition
of
novel
reading
and
the
place
of
novels
would
be
taken
by
suitable
biographical
literature
the
life
of
franklin
for
instance
or
moritz
footnote
moritz
was
a
miscellaneous
writer
of
the
last
century
his
composed
in
the
form
of
a
novel
is
practically
an
autobiography
in
our
early
days
we
fancy
that
the
leading
events
in
our
life
and
the
persons
who
are
going
to
play
an
important
part
in
it
will
make
their
entrance
to
the
sound
of
drums
and
trumpets
but
when
in
old
age
we
look
back
we
find
that
they
all
came
in
quite
quietly
slipped
in
as
it
were
by
the
almost
unnoticed
from
the
point
of

we
have
been
taking
up
until

life
may
be

to
a
piece
of
embroidery

half
of
his
time
a
man
gets
a
sight
of
the
right
side

second
half
of
the
wrong
the
wrong
side
is
not
so
pretty
as
the
right
but
it
is
more
instructive
it
shows
the
way
in
which
the
threads
have
been
worked
together
intellectual
superiority
even
if
it
is
of
the
highest
kind
will
not
secure
for
a
man
a
preponderating
place
in
conversation
until
after
he
is
forty
years
of
age
for
age
and
experience
though
they
can
never
be
a
substitute
for
intellectual
talent
may
far
outweigh
it
and
even
in
a
person
of
the
meanest
capacity
they
give
a
certain
counterpoise
to
the
power
of
an
extremely
intellectual
man
so
long
as
the
latter
is
young
of
course
i
allude
here
to
personal
superiority
not
to
the
place
a

may
gain

his
works

in
those

and
usually
in
both
he
reaches
a
level
to
which
they
do
not
attain
so
he
gladly
avoids
having
anything
more
to
do

for
it
may
be
said
in
general
that
every

due

death

please
we
look
upon
life
as
endless
and
use
our
time
recklessly
but
the
older
we
become
the
more
we
practice
economy
for
towards
the
close
of
life
every
day
we
live
gives
us
the
same
kind
of
sensation
as
the
criminal
experiences
at
every
step
on
his
way
to
be
tried
from
the
standpoint
of
youth
life
seems
to
stretch
away
into
an
endless
future
from
the
standpoint
of
old
age
to
go
back
but
a
little
way
into
the
past
so
that
at
the
beginning
life
presents
us
with
a
picture
in
which
the
objects
appear
a
great
way
off
as
though
we
had
reversed
our
telescope
while
in
the
end
everything
seems
so
close
to
see
how
short
life
is
a
man
must
have
grown
old
that
is
to
say
he
must
have
lived
long
on
the
other
hand
as
the
years
increase
things
look
smaller
one
and
all
and
life
which
had
so
firm
and
stable
a
base
in
the
days
of
our
youth
now
seems
nothing
but
a
rapid
flight
of
moments
every
one
of
them
illusory
we
have
come
to
see
that
the
whole
world
is
vanity
time
itself
seems
to
go
at
a
much
slower
pace
when
we
are
young
so
that
not
only
is
the
first
quarter
of
life
the
happiest
it
is
also
the
longest
of
all
it
leaves
more
memories
behind
it
if
a
man
were
put
to
it
he
could
tell
you
more
out
of
the
first
quarter
of
his
life
than
out
of
two
of
the
remaining
periods
nay
in
the
spring
of
life
as
in
the
spring
of
the
year
the
days
reach
a
length
that
is
positively
tiresome
but
in
the
autumn
whether
of
the
year
or
of
life
though
they
are
short
they
are
more
genial
and
uniform
but
why
is
it
that
to
an
old
man
his
past
life
appears
so
short
for
this
reason
his
memory
is
short
and
so
he
fancies
that
his
life
has
been
short
too
he
no
longer
remembers
the
insignificant
parts
of
it
and
much
that
was
unpleasant
is
now
forgotten
how
little
then
there
is
left
for
in
general
a
man
memory
is
as
imperfect
as
his
intellect
and
he
must
make
a
practice
of
reflecting
upon
the
lessons
he
has
learned
and
the
events
he
has
experienced
if
he
does
not
want
them
both
to
sink
gradually
into
the
gulf
of
oblivion
now
we
are
unaccustomed
to
reflect
upon
matters
of
no
importance
or
as
a
rule
upon
things
that
we
have
found
disagreeable
and
yet
that
is
necessary
if
the
memory
of
them
is
to
be
preserved
but
the
class
of
things
that
may
be
called
insignificant
is
continually
receiving
fresh
additions
much
that
wears
an
air
of
importance
at
first
gradually
becomes
of
no
consequence
at
all
from
the
fact
of
its
frequent
repetition
so
that
in
the
end
we
actually
lose
count
of
the
number
of
times
it
happens
hence
we
are
better
able
to
remember
the
events
of
our
early
than
of
our
later
years
the
longer
we
live
the
fewer
are
the
things
that
we
can
call
important
or
significant
enough
to
deserve
further
consideration
and
by
this
alone
can
they
be
fixed
in
the
memory
in
other
words
they
are
forgotten
as
soon
as
they
are
past
thus
it
is
that
time
runs
on
leaving
always
fewer
traces
of
its
passage
further
if
disagreeable
things
have
happened
to
us
we
do
not
care
to
ruminate
upon
them
least
of
all
when
they
touch
our
vanity
as
is
usually
the
case
for
few
misfortunes
fall
upon
us
for
which
we
can
be
held
entirely
blameless
so
people
are
very
ready
to
forget
many
things
that
are
disagreeable
as
well
as
many
that
are
unimportant
it
is
from
this
double
cause
that
our
memory
is
so
short
and
a
recollection
of
what
has
happened
always
becomes
proportionately
shorter
the
more
things
that
have
occupied
him
in
life
the
things
we
did
in
years
gone
by
the
events
that
happened
long
ago
are
like
those
objects
on
the
coast
which
to
the
seafarer
on
his
outward
voyage
become
smaller
every
minute
more
unrecognizable
and
harder
to
distinguish
again
it
sometimes
happens
that
memory
and
imagination
will
call
up
some
long
past
scene
as
vividly
as
if
it
had
occurred
only
yesterday
so
that
the
event
in
question
seems
to
stand
very
near
to
the
present
time
the
reason
of
this
is
that
it
is
impossible
to
call
up
all
the
intervening
period
in
the
same
vivid
way
as
there
is
no
one
figure
pervading
it
which
can
be
taken
in
at
a
glance
and
besides
most
of
the
things
that
happened
in
that
period
are
forgotten
and
all
that
remains
of
it
is
the
general
knowledge
that
we
have
lived
through
it
a
mere
notion
of
abstract
existence
not
a
direct
vision
of
some
particular
experience
it
is
this
that
causes
some
single
event
of
long
ago
to
appear
as
though
it
took
place
but
yesterday
the
intervening
time
vanishes
and
the
whole
of
life
looks
incredibly
short
nay
there
are
occasional
moments
in
old
age
when
we
can
scarcely
believe
that
we
are
so
advanced
in
years
or
that
the
long
past
lying
behind
us
has
had
any
real
existence
a
feeling
which
is
mainly
due
to
the
circumstance
that
the
present
always
seems
fixed
and
immovable
as
we
look
at
it
these
and
similar
mental
phenomena
are
ultimately
to
be
traced
to
the
fact
that
it
is
not
our
nature
in
itself
but
only
the
outward
presentation
of
it
that
lies
in
time
and
that
the
present
is
the
point
of
contact
between
the
world
as
subject
and
the
world
as
object
footnote
by
this
remark
schopenhauer
means
that
which
as
he
argues
forms
the
inner
reality
underlying
all
the
phenomena
of
life
and
nature
is
not
in
itself
affected
by
time
but
that
on
the
other
hand
time
is
necessary
for
the
objectification
of
the
will
for
the
will
as
presented
in
the
passing
phenomena
of
the
world
time
is
thus
definable
as
the
condition
of
change
and
the
present
time
as
the
only
point
of
contact
between
reality
and
appearance
again
why
is
it
that
in
youth
we
can
see
no
end
to
the
years
that
seem
to
lie
before
us
because
we
are
obliged
to
find
room
for
all
the
things
we
hope
to
attain
in
life
we
cram
the
years
so
full
of
projects
that
if
we
were
to
try
and
carry
them
all
out
death
would
come
prematurely
though
we
reached
the
age
of
methuselah
another
reason
why
life
looks
so
long
when
we
are
young
is
that
we
are
apt
to
measure
its
length
by
the
few
years
we
have
already
lived
in
those
early
years
things
are
new
to
us
and
so
they
appear
important
we
dwell
upon
them
after
they
have
happened
and
often
call
them
to
mind
and
thus
in
youth
life
seems
replete
with
incident
and
therefore
of
long
duration
sometimes
we
credit
ourselves
with
a
longing
to
be
in
some
distant
spot
whereas
in
truth
we
are
only
longing
to
have
the
time
back
again
which
we
spent
there
days
when
we
were
younger
and
fresher
than
we
are
now
in
those
moments
time
mocks
us
by
wearing
the
mask
of
space
and
if
we
travel
to
the
spot
we
can
see
how
much
we
have
been
deceived
there
are
two
ways
of
reaching
a
great
age
both
of
which
presuppose
a
sound
constitution
as
a
sine
quâ
they
may
be
illustrated
by
two
lamps
one
of
which
burns
a
long
time
with
very
little
oil
because
it
has
a
very
thin
wick
and
the
other
just
as
long
though
it
has
a
very
thick
one
because
there
is
plenty
of
oil
to
feed
it
here
the
oil
is
the
vital
energy
and
the
difference
in
the
wick
is
the
manifold
way
in
which
the
vital
energy
is
used
up
to
our
year
we
may
be
compared
in
respect
of
the
way
in
which
we
use
our
vital
energy
to
people
who
live
on
the
interest
of
their
money
what
they
spend
they
have
again
but
from
the
age
of
onwards
our
position
is
like
that
of
the
investor
who
begins
to
entrench
upon
his
capital
at
first
he
hardly
notices
any
difference
at
all
as
the
greater
part
of
his
expenses
is
covered
by
the
interest
of
his
securities
and
if
the
deficit
is
but
slight
he
pays
no
attention
to
it
but
the
deficit
goes
on
increasing
until
he
awakes
to
the
fact
that
it
is
becoming
more
serious
every
day
his
position
becomes
less
and
less
secure
and
he
feels
himself
growing
poorer
and
poorer
while
he
has
no
expectation
of
this
drain
upon
his
resources
coming
to
an
end
his
fall
from
wealth
to
poverty
becomes
faster
every
moment
like
the
fall
of
a
solid
body
in
space
until
at
last
he
has
absolutely
nothing
left
a
man
is
truly
in
a
woeful
plight
if
both
the
terms
of
this
comparison
his
vital
energy
and
his
wealth
really
begin
to
melt
away
at
one
and
the
same
time
it
is
the
dread
of
this
calamity
that
makes
love
of
possession
increase
with
age
on
the
other
hand
at
the
beginning
of
life
in
the
years
before
we
attain
majority
and
for
some
little
time
afterwards
the
state
of
our
vital
energy
puts
us
on
a
level
with
those
who
each
year
lay
by
a
part
of
their
interest
and
add
it
to
their
capital
in
other
words
not
only
does
their
interest
come
in
regularly
but
the
capital
is
constantly
receiving
additions
this
happy
condition
of
affairs
is
sometimes
brought
about
with
health
as
with
money
under
the
watchful
care
of
some
honest
guardian
o
happy
youth
and
sad
old
age
nevertheless
a
man
should
economize
his
strength
even
when
he
is
young
aristotle
observes
that
amongst
those
who
were
victors
at
olympia
only
two
or
three
gained
a
prize
at
two
different
periods
once
in
boyhood
and
then
again
when
they
came
to
be
men
and
the
reason
of
this
was
that
the
premature
efforts
which
the
training
involved
so
completely
exhausted
their
powers
that
they
failed
to
last
on
into
manhood
as
this
is
true
of
muscular
so
it
is
still
more
true
of
nervous
energy
of
which
all
intellectual
achievements
are
the
manifestation
hence
those
infant
prodigies
the
fruit
of
a
education
who
surprise
us
by
their
cleverness
as
children
afterwards
turn
out
very
ordinary
folk
nay
the
manner
in
which
boys
are
forced
into
an
early
acquaintance
with
the
ancient
tongues
may
perhaps
be
to
blame
for
the
dullness
and
lack
of
judgment
which
distinguish
so
many
learned
persons
footnote
i
have
said
that
almost
every
man
character
seems
to
be
specially
suited
to
some
one
period
of
life
so
that
on
reaching
it
the
man
is
at
his
best
some
people
are
charming
so
long
as
they
are
young
and
afterwards
there
is
nothing
attractive
about
them
others
are
vigorous
and
active
in
manhood
and
then
lose
all
the
value
they
possess
as
they
advance
in
years
many
appear
to
best
advantage
in
old
age
when
their
character
assumes
a
gentler
tone
as
becomes
men
who
have
seen
the
world
and
take
life
easily
this
is
often
the
case
with
the
french
this
peculiarity
must
be
due
to
the
fact
that
the
man
character
has
something
in
it
akin
to
the
qualities
of
youth
or
manhood
or
old
age
something
which
accords
with
one
or
another
of
these
periods
of
life
or
perhaps
acts
as
a
corrective
to
its
special
failings
the
mariner
observes
the
progress
he
makes
only
by
the
way
in
which
objects
on
the
coast
fade
away
into
the
distance
and
apparently
decrease
in
size
in
the
same
way
a
man
becomes
conscious
that
he
is
advancing
in
years
when
he
finds
that
people
older
than
himself
begin
to
seem
young
to
him
it
has
already
been
remarked
that
the
older
a
man
becomes
the
fewer
are
the
traces
left
in
his
mind
by
all
that
he
sees
does
or
experiences
and
the
cause
of
this
has
been
explained
there
is
thus
a
sense
in
which
it
may
be
said
that
it
is
only
in
youth
that
a
man
lives
with
a
full
degree
of
consciousness
and
that
he
is
only
half
alive
when
he
is
old
as
the
years
advance
his
consciousness
of
what
goes
on
about
him
dwindles
and
the
things
of
life
hurry
by
without
making
any
impression
upon
him
just
as
none
is
made
by
a
work
of
art
seen
for
the
thousandth
time
a
man
does
what
his
hand
finds
to
do
and
afterwards
he
does
not
know
whether
he
has
done
it
or
not
as
life
becomes
more
and
more
unconscious
the
nearer
it
approaches
the
point
at
which
all
consciousness
ceases
the
course
of
time
itself
seems
to
increase
in
rapidity
in
childhood
all
the
things
and
circumstances
of
life
are
novel
and
that
is
sufficient
to
awake
us
to
the
full
consciousness
of
existence
hence
at
that
age
the
day
seems
of
such
immense
length
the
same
thing
happens
when
we
are
traveling
one
month
seems
longer
then
than
four
spent
at
home
still
though
time
seems
to
last
longer
when
we
are
young
or
on
a
journey
the
sense
of
novelty
does
not
prevent
it
from
now
and
then
in
reality
hanging
heavily
upon
our
hands
under
both
these
circumstances
at
any
rate
more
than
is
the
case
when
we
are
old
or
staying
at
home
but
the
intellect
gradually
becomes
so
rubbed
down
and
blunted
by
long
habituation
to
such
impressions
that
things
have
a
constant
tendency
to
produce
less
and
less
impression
upon
us
as
they
pass
by
and
this
makes
time
seem
increasingly
less
important
and
therefore
shorter
in
duration
the
hours
of
the
boy
are
longer
than
the
days
of
the
old
man
accordingly
time
goes
faster
and
faster
the
longer
we
live
like
a
ball
rolling
down
a
hill
or
to
take
another
example
as
in
a
revolving
disc
the
further
a
point
lies
from
the
centre
the
more
rapid
is
its
rate
of
progression
so
it
is
in
the
wheel
of
life
the
further
you
stand
from
the
beginning
the
faster
time
moves
for
you
hence
it
may
be
said
that
as
far
as
concerns
the
immediate
sensation
that
time
makes
upon
our
minds
the
length
of
any
given
year
is
in
direct
proportion
to
the
number
of
times
it
will
divide
our
whole
life
for
instance
at
the
age
of
fifty
the
year
appears
to
us
only
as
long
as
it
did
at
the
age
of
five
this
variation
in
the
rate
at
which
time
appears
to
move
exercises
a
most
decided
influence
upon
the
whole
nature
of
our
existence
at
every
period
of
it
first
of
all
it
causes
childhood
even
though
it
embrace
only
a
span
of
fifteen
years
to
seem
the
longest
period
of
life
and
therefore
the
richest
in
reminiscences
next
it
brings
it
about
that
a
man
is
apt
to
be
bored
just
in
proportion
as
he
is
young
consider
for
instance
that
constant
need
of
occupation
whether
it
is
work
or
play
that
is
shown
by
children
if
they
come
to
an
end
of
both
work
and
play
a
terrible
feeling
of
boredom
ensues
even
in
youth
people
are
by
no
means
free
from
this
tendency
and
dread
the
hours
when
they
have
nothing
to
do
as
manhood
approaches
boredom
disappears
and
old
men
find
the
time
too
short
when
their
days
fly
past
them
like
arrows
from
a
bow
of
course
i
must
be
understood
to
speak
of
not
of
decrepit
with
this
increased
rapidity
of
time
boredom
mostly
passes
away
as
we
advance
in
life
and
as
the
passions
with
all
their
attendant
pain
are
then
laid
asleep
the
burden
of
life
is
on
the
whole
appreciably
lighter
in
later
years
than
in
youth
provided
of
course
that
health
remains
so
it
is
that
the
period
immediately
preceding
the
weakness
and
troubles
of
old
age
receives
the
name
of
a
man
that
may
be
a
true
appellation
in
view
of
the
comfortable
feeling
which
those
years
bring
but
for
all
that
the
years
of
youth
when
our
consciousness
is
lively
and
open
to
every
sort
of
impression
have
this
privilege
that
then
the
seeds
are
sown
and
the
buds
come
forth
it
is
the
springtime
of
the
mind
deep
truths
may
be
perceived
but
can
never
be
excogitated
that
is
to
say
the
first
knowledge
of
them
is
immediate
called
forth
by
some
momentary
impression
this
knowledge
is
of
such
a
kind
as
to
be
attainable
only
when
the
impressions
are
strong
lively
and
deep
and
if
we
are
to
be
acquainted
with
deep
truths
everything
depends
upon
a
proper
use
of
our
early
years
in
later
life
we
may
be
better
able
to
work
upon
other
people
upon
the
world
because
our
natures
are
then
finished
and
rounded
off
and
no
more
a
prey
to
fresh
views
but
then
the
world
is
less
able
to
work
upon
us
these
are
the
years
of
action
and
achievement
while
youth
is
the
time
for
forming
fundamental
conceptions
and
laying
down
the
of
thought
in
youth
it
is
the
outward
aspect
of
things
that
most
engages
us
while
in
age
thought
or
reflection
is
the
predominating
quality
of
the
mind
hence
youth
is
the
time
for
poetry
and
age
is
more
inclined
to
philosophy
in
practical
affairs
it
is
the
same
a
man
shapes
his
resolutions
in
youth
more
by
the
impression
that
the
outward
world
makes
upon
him
whereas
when
he
is
old
it
is
thought
that
determines
his
actions
this
is
partly
to
be
explained
by
the
fact
that
it
is
only
when
a
man
is
old
that
the
results
of
outward
observation
are
present
in
sufficient
numbers
to
allow
of
their
being
classified
according
to
the
ideas
they
represent
a
process
which
in
its
turn
causes
those
ideas
to
be
more
fully
understood
in
all
their
bearings
and
the
exact
value
and
amount
of
trust
to
be
placed
in
them
fixed
and
determined
while
at
the
same
time
he
has
grown
accustomed
to
the
impressions
produced
by
the
various
phenomena
of
life
and
their
effects
on
him
are
no
longer
what
they
were
contrarily
in
youth
the
impressions
that
things
make
that
is
to
say
the
outward
aspects
of
life
are
so
overpoweringly
strong
especially
in
the
case
of
people
of
lively
and
imaginative
disposition
that
they
view
the
world
like
a
picture
and
their
chief
concern
is
the
figure
they
cut
in
it
the
appearance
they
present
nay
they
are
unaware
of
the
extent
to
which
this
is
the
case
it
is
a
quality
of
mind
that
shows
itself
if
in
no
other
way
in
that
personal
vanity
and
that
love
of
fine
clothes
which
distinguish
young
people
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
intellectual
powers
are
most
capable
of
enduring
great
and
sustained
efforts
in
youth
up
to
the
age
of
at
latest
from
which
period
their
strength
begins
to
decline
though
very
gradually
still
the
later
years
of
life
and
even
old
age
itself
are
not
without
their
intellectual
compensation
it
is
only
then
that
a
man
can
be
said
to
be
really
rich
in
experience
or
in
learning
he
has
then
had
time
and
opportunity
enough
to
enable
him
to
see
and
think
over
life
from
all
its
sides
he
has
been
able
to
compare
one
thing
with
another
and
to
discover
points
of
contact
and
connecting
links
so
that
only
then
are
the
true
relations
of
things
rightly
understood
further
in
old
age
there
comes
an
increased
depth
in
the
knowledge
that
was
acquired
in
youth
a
man
has
now
many
more
illustrations
of
any
ideas
he
may
have
attained
things
which
he
thought
he
knew
when
he
was
young
he
now
knows
in
reality
and
besides
his
range
of
knowledge
is
wider
and
in
whatever
direction
it
extends
it
is
thorough
and
therefore
formed
into
a
consistent
and
connected
whole
whereas
in
youth
knowledge
is
always
defective
and
fragmentary
a
complete
and
adequate
notion
of
life
can
never
be
attained
by
any
one
who
does
not
reach
old
age
for
it
is
only
the
old
man
who
sees
life
whole
and
knows
its
natural
course
it
is
only
he
who
is
acquainted
and
this
is
most
important
not
only
with
its
entrance
like
the
rest
of
mankind
but
with
its
exit
too
so
that
he
alone
has
a
full
sense
of
its
utter
vanity
whilst
the
others
never
cease
to
labor
under
the
false
notion
that
everything
will
come
right
in
the
end
on
the
other
hand
there
is
more
conceptive
power
in
youth
and
at
that
time
of
life
a
man
can
make
more
out
of
the
little
that
he
knows
in
age
judgment
penetration
and
thoroughness
predominate
youth
is
the
time
for
amassing
the
material
for
a
knowledge
of
the
world
that
shall
be
distinctive
and
peculiar
for
an
original
view
of
life
in
other
words
the
legacy
that
a
man
of
genius
leaves
to
his
it
is
however
only
in
later
years
that
he
becomes
master
of
his
material
accordingly
it
will
be
found
that
as
a
rule
a
great
writer
gives
his
best
work
to
the
world
when
he
is
about
fifty
years
of
age
but
though
the
tree
of
knowledge
must
reach
its
full
height
before
it
can
bear
fruit
the
roots
of
it
lie
in
youth
every
generation
no
matter
how
paltry
its
character
thinks
itself
much
wiser
than
the
one
immediately
preceding
it
let
alone
those
that
are
more
remote
it
is
just
the
same
with
the
different
periods
in
a
man
life
and
yet
often
in
the
one
case
no
less
than
in
the
other
it
is
a
mistaken
opinion
in
the
years
of
physical
growth
when
our
powers
of
mind
and
our
stores
of
knowledge
are
receiving
daily
additions
it
becomes
a
habit
for
to
look
down
with
contempt
upon
yesterday
the
habit
strikes
root
and
remains
even
after
the
intellectual
powers
have
begun
to
decline
when
should
rather
look
up
with
respect
to
yesterday
so
it
is
that
we
often
unduly
depreciate
the
achievements
as
well
as
the
judgments
of
our
youth
this
seems
the
place
for
making
the
general
observation
that
although
in
its
main
qualities
a
man
or
as
well
as
his
or
is
innate
yet
the
former
is
by
no
means
so
unalterable
in
its
nature
as
the
latter
the
fact
is
that
the
intellect
is
subject
to
very
many
transformations
which
as
a
rule
do
not
fail
to
make
their
actual
appearance
and
this
is
so
partly
because
the
intellect
has
a
deep
foundation
in
the
physique
and
partly
because
the
material
with
which
it
deals
is
given
in
experience
and
so
from
a
physical
point
of
view
we
find
that
if
a
man
has
any
peculiar
power
it
first
gradually
increases
in
strength
until
it
reaches
its
acme
after
which
it
enters
upon
a
path
of
slow
decadence
until
it
ends
in
imbecility
but
on
the
other
hand
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
the
material
which
gives
employment
to
a
man
powers
and
keeps
them
in
activity
the
of
thought
and
knowledge
experience
intellectual
attainments
the
practice
of
seeing
to
the
bottom
of
things
and
so
a
perfect
mental
vision
form
in
themselves
a
mass
which
continues
to
increase
in
size
until
the
time
comes
when
weakness
shows
itself
and
the
man
powers
suddenly
fail
the
way
in
which
these
two
distinguishable
elements
combine
in
the
same
nature
the
one
absolutely
unalterable
and
the
other
subject
to
change
in
two
directions
opposed
to
each
other
explains
the
variety
of
mental
attitude
and
the
dissimilarity
of
value
which
attach
to
a
man
at
different
periods
of
life
the
same
truth
may
be
more
broadly
expressed
by
saying
that
the
first
forty
years
of
life
furnish
the
text
while
the
remaining
thirty
supply
the
commentary
and
that
without
the
commentary
we
are
unable
to
understand
aright
the
true
sense
and
coherence
of
the
text
together
with
the
moral
it
contains
and
all
the
subtle
application
of
which
it
admits
towards
the
close
of
life
much
the
same
thing
happens
as
at
the
end
of
a
the
masks
are
taken
off
then
you
can
see
who
the
people
really
are
with
whom
you
have
come
into
contact
in
your
passage
through
the
world
for
by
the
end
of
life
characters
have
come
out
in
their
true
light
actions
have
borne
fruit
achievements
have
been
rightly
appreciated
and
all
shams
have
fallen
to
pieces
for
this
time
was
in
every
case
requisite
but
the
most
curious
fact
is
that
it
is
also
only
towards
the
close
of
life
than
a
man
really
recognizes
and
understands
his
own
true
self
the
aims
and
objects
he
has
followed
in
life
more
especially
the
kind
of
relation
in
which
he
has
stood
to
other
people
and
to
the
world
it
will
often
happen
that
as
a
result
of
this
knowledge
a
man
will
have
to
assign
himself
a
lower
place
than
he
formerly
thought
was
his
due
but
there
are
exceptions
to
this
rule
and
it
will
occasionally
be
the
case
that
he
will
take
a
higher
position
than
he
had
before
this
will
be
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
had
no
adequate
notion
of
the
of
the
world
and
that
he
set
up
a
higher
aim
for
himself
than
was
followed
by
the
rest
of
mankind
the
progress
of
life
shows
a
man
the
stuff
of
which
he
is
made
it
is
customary
to
call
youth
the
happy
and
age
the
sad
part
of
life
this
would
be
true
if
it
were
the
passions
that
made
a
man
happy
youth
is
swayed
to
and
fro
by
them
and
they
give
a
great
deal
of
pain
and
little
pleasure
in
age
the
passions
cool
and
leave
a
man
at
rest
and
then
forthwith
his
mind
takes
a
contemplative
tone
the
intellect
is
set
free
and
attains
the
upper
hand
and
since
in
itself
intellect
is
beyond
the
range
of
pain
and
man
feels
happy
just
in
so
far
as
his
intellect
is
the
predominating
part
of
him
it
need
only
be
remembered
that
all
pleasure
is
negative
and
that
pain
is
positive
in
its
nature
in
order
to
see
that
the
passions
can
never
be
a
source
of
happiness
and
that
age
is
not
the
less
to
be
envied
on
the
ground
that
many
pleasures
are
denied
it
for
every
sort
of
pleasure
is
never
anything
more
than
the
quietive
of
some
need
or
longing
and
that
pleasure
should
come
to
an
end
as
soon
as
the
need
ceases
is
no
more
a
subject
of
complaint
than
that
a
man
can
not
go
on
eating
after
he
has
had
his
dinner
or
fall
asleep
again
after
a
good
night
rest
so
far
from
youth
being
the
happiest
period
of
life
there
is
much
more
truth
in
the
remark
made
by
plato
at
the
beginning
of
the
that
the
prize
should
rather
be
given
to
old
age
because
then
at
last
a
man
is
freed
from
the
animal
passion
which
has
hitherto
never
ceased
to
disquiet
him
nay
it
may
even
be
said
that
the
countless
and
manifold
humors
which
have
their
source
in
this
passion
and
the
emotions
that
spring
from
it
produce
a
mild
state
of
madness
and
this
lasts
as
long
as
the
man
is
subject
to
the
spell
of
the
impulse
this
evil
spirit
as
it
were
of
which
there
is
no
riddance
so
that
he
never
really
becomes
a
reasonable
being
until
the
passion
is
extinguished
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
general
and
apart
from
individual
circumstances
and
particular
dispositions
youth
is
marked
by
a
certain
melancholy
and
sadness
while
genial
sentiments
attach
to
old
age
and
the
reason
for
this
is
nothing
but
the
fact
that
the
young
man
is
still
under
the
service
nay
the
forced
labor
imposed
by
that
evil
spirit
which
scarcely
ever
leaves
him
a
moment
to
himself
to
this
source
may
be
traced
directly
or
indirectly
almost
all
and
every
ill
that
befalls
or
menaces
mankind
the
old
man
is
genial
and
cheerful
because
after
long
lying
in
the
bonds
of
passion
he
can
now
move
about
in
freedom
still
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
when
this
passion
is
extinguished
the
true
kernel
of
life
is
gone
and
nothing
remains
but
the
hollow
shell
or
from
another
point
of
view
life
then
becomes
like
a
comedy
which
begun
by
real
actors
is
continued
and
brought
to
an
end
by
automata
dressed
in
their
clothes
however
that
may
be
youth
is
the
period
of
unrest
and
age
of
repose
and
from
that
very
circumstance
the
relative
degree
of
pleasure
belonging
to
each
may
be
inferred
the
child
stretches
out
its
little
hands
in
the
eager
desire
to
seize
all
the
pretty
things
that
meet
its
sight
charmed
by
the
world
because
all
its
senses
are
still
so
young
and
fresh
much
the
same
thing
happens
with
the
youth
and
he
displays
greater
energy
in
his
quest
he
too
is
charmed
by
all
the
pretty
things
and
the
many
pleasing
shapes
that
surround
him
and
forthwith
his
imagination
conjures
up
pleasures
which
the
world
can
never
realize
so
he
is
filled
with
an
ardent
desire
for
he
knows
not
what
delights
robbing
him
of
all
rest
and
making
happiness
impossible
but
when
old
age
is
reached
all
this
is
over
and
done
with
partly
because
the
blood
runs
cooler
and
the
senses
are
no
longer
so
easily
allured
partly
because
experience
has
shown
the
true
value
of
things
and
the
futility
of
pleasure
whereby
illusion
has
been
gradually
dispelled
and
the
strange
fancies
and
prejudices
which
previously
concealed
or
distorted
a
free
and
true
view
of
the
world
have
been
dissipated
and
put
to
flight
with
the
result
that
a
man
can
now
get
a
juster
and
clearer
view
and
see
things
as
they
are
and
also
in
a
measure
attain
more
or
less
insight
into
the
nullity
of
all
things
on
this
earth
it
is
this
that
gives
almost
every
old
man
no
matter
how
ordinary
his
faculties
may
be
a
certain
tincture
of
wisdom
which
distinguishes
him
from
the
young
but
the
chief
result
of
all
this
change
is
the
peace
of
mind
that
ensues
a
great
element
in
happiness
and
in
fact
the
condition
and
essence
of
it
while
the
young
man
fancies
that
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
good
things
in
the
world
if
he
could
only
come
at
them
the
old
man
is
steeped
in
the
truth
of
the
words
that
things
are
knowing
that
however
gilded
the
shell
the
nut
is
hollow
in
these
later
years
and
not
before
a
man
comes
to
a
true
appreciation
of
horace
maxim
he
is
directly
and
sincerely
convinced
of
the
vanity
of
everything
and
that
all
the
glories
of
the
world
are
as
nothing
his
illusions
are
gone
he
is
no
more
beset
with
the
idea
that
there
is
any
particular
amount
of
happiness
anywhere
in
the
palace
or
in
the
cottage
any
more
than
he
himself
enjoys
when
he
is
free
from
bodily
or
mental
pain
the
worldly
distinctions
of
great
and
small
high
and
low
exist
for
him
no
longer
and
in
this
blissful
state
of
mind
the
old
man
may
look
down
with
a
smile
upon
all
false
notions
he
is
completely
undeceived
and
knows
that
whatever
may
be
done
to
adorn
human
life
and
deck
it
out
in
finery
its
paltry
character
will
soon
show
through
the
glitter
of
its
surroundings
and
that

it
as
one
may
it
remains
everywhere
much
the

an
existence
which
has
no
true
value

in
freedom
from

then
found
out
that
behind
most
of
the
things
he
wants
and
most
of
the
pleasures
he
longs
for
there
is
very
little
after
all
and
so
he
comes
by
degrees
to
see
that
our
existence
is
all
empty
and
void
it
is
only
when
he
is
seventy
years
old
that
he
quite
understands
the
first
words
of
the
preacher
and
this
again
explains
why
it
is
that
old
men
are
sometimes
fretful
and
morose
it
is
often
said
that
the
common
lot
of
old
age
is
disease
and
weariness
of
life
disease
is
by
no
means
essential
to
old
age
especially
where
a
really
long
span
of
years
is
to
be
attained
for
as
life
goes
on
the
conditions
of
health
and
disorder
tend
to
increase
vita
crescit
sanitas
et
and
as
far
as
weariness
or
boredom
is
concerned
i
have
stated
above
why
old
age
is
even
less
exposed
to
that
form
of
evil
than
youth
nor
is
boredom
by
any
means
to
be
taken
as
a
necessary
accompaniment
of
that
solitude
which
for
reasons
that
do
not
require
to
be
explained
old
age
certainly
can
not
escape
it
is
rather
the
fate
that
awaits
those
who
have
never
known
any
other
pleasures
but
the
gratification
of
the
senses
and
the
delights
of
society
who
have
left
their
minds
unenlightened
and
their
faculties
unused
it
is
quite
true
that
the
intellectual
faculties
decline
with
the
approach
of
old
age
but
where
they
were
originally
strong
there
will
always
be
enough
left
to
combat
the
onslaught
of
boredom
and
then
again
as
i
have
said
experience
knowledge
reflection
and
skill
in
dealing
with
men
combine
to
give
an
old
man
an
increasingly
accurate
insight
into
the
ways
of
the
world
his
judgment
becomes
keen
and
he
attains
a
coherent
view
of
life
his
mental
vision
embraces
a
wider
range
constantly
finding
new
uses
for
his
stores
of
knowledge
and
adding
to
them
at
every
opportunity
he
maintains
uninterrupted
that
inward
process
of
which
gives
employment
and
satisfaction
to
the
mind
and
thus
forms
the
due
reward
of
all
its
efforts
all
this
serves
in
some
measure
as
a
compensation
for
decreased
intellectual
power
and
besides
time
as
i
have
remarked
seems
to
go
much
more
quickly
when
we
are
advanced
in
years
and
this
is
in
itself
a
preventive
of
boredom
there
is
no
great
harm
in
the
fact
that
a
man
bodily
strength
decreases
in
old
age
unless
indeed
he
requires
it
to
make
a
living
to
be
poor
when
one
is
old
is
a
great
misfortune
if
a
man
is
secure
from
that
and
retains
his
health
old
age
may
be
a
very
passable
time
of
life
its
chief
necessity
is
to
be
comfortable
and
well
off
and
in
consequence
money
is
then
prized
more
than
ever
because
it
is
a
substitute
for
failing
strength
deserted
by
venus
the
old
man
likes
to
turn
to
bacchus
to
make
him
merry
in
the
place
of
wanting
to
see
things
to
travel
and
learn
comes
the
desire
to
speak
and
teach
it
is
a
piece
of
good
fortune
if
the
old
man
retains
some
of
his
love
of
study
or
of
music
or
of
the
theatre
if
in
general
he
is
still
somewhat
susceptible
to
the
things
about
him
as
is
indeed
the
case
with
some
people
to
a
very
late
age
at
that
time
of
life
a
man
has
in
is
of
greater
advantage
to
him
that
ever
it
was
before
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
most
people
who
have
never
been
anything
but
dull
and
stupid
become
more
and
more
of
automata
as
they
grow
old
they
have
always
thought
said
and
done
the
same
things
as
their
neighbors
and
nothing
that
happens
now
can
change
their
disposition
or
make
them
act
otherwise
to
talk
to
old
people
of
this
kind
is
like
writing
on
the
sand
if
you
produce
any
impression
at
all
it
is
gone
almost
immediately
old
age
is
here
nothing
but
the
of
life
all
that
is
essential
to
manhood
is
gone
there
are
cases
in
which
nature
supplies
a
third
set
of
teeth
in
old
age
thereby
apparently
demonstrating
the
fact
that
that
period
of
life
is
a
second
childhood
it
is
certainly
a
very
melancholy
thing
that
all
a
man
faculties
tend
to
waste
away
as
he
grows
old
and
at
a
rate
that
increases
in
rapidity
but
still
this
is
a
necessary
nay
a
beneficial
arrangement
as
otherwise
death
for
which
it
is
a
preparation
would
be
too
hard
to
bear
so
the
greatest
boon
that
follows
the
attainment
of
extreme
old
age
is
an
easy
death
not
ushered
in
by
disease
and
free
from
all
pain
and
struggle
for
let
a
man
live
as
long
as
he
may
he
is
never
conscious
of
any
moment
but
the
present
one
and
indivisible
and
in
those
late
years
the
mind
loses
more
every
day
by
sheer
forgetfulness
than
ever
it
gains
anew

for
a
further
description
of
this
happy
end
to
life
the
main
difference
between
youth
and
age
will
always
be
that
youth
looks
forward
to
life
and
old
age
to
death
and
that
while
the
one
has
a
short
past
and
a
long
future
before
it
the
case
is
just
the
opposite
with
the
other
it
is
quite
true
that
when
a
man
is
old
to
die
is
the
only
thing
that
awaits
him
while
if
he
is
young
he
may
expect
to
live
and
the
question
arises
which
of
the
two
fates
is
the
more
hazardous
and
if
life
is
not
a
matter
which
on
the
whole
it
is
better
to
have
behind
one
than
before
does
not
the
preacher
say
day
of
death
is
better
than
the
day
of
one
it
is
certainly
a
rash
thing
to
wish
for
long
life
for
as
the
spanish
proverb
has
it
it
means
to
see
much
evil

footnote

footnote
the
life
of
man
can
not
strictly
speaking
be
called
either
or
since
it
is
the
ultimate
standard
by
which
duration
of
time
in
regard
to
all
other
things
is
measured
in
one
of
the
vedic
ii
natural
of
human
life
is
put
down
at
one
hundred
years
and
i
believe
this
to
be
right
i
have
observed
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
is
only
people
who
exceed
the
age
of
ninety
who
attain
who
die
that
is
to
say
of
no
disease
apoplexy
or
convulsion
and
pass
away
without
agony
of
any
sort
nay
who
sometimes
even
show
no
pallor
but
expire
generally
in
a
sitting
attitude
and
often
after
a
meal
or
i
may
say
simply
cease
to
live
rather
than
die
to
come
to
one
end
before
the
age
of
ninety
means
to
die
of
disease
in
other
words
prematurely
now
the
old
testament
psalms
xc
puts
the
limit
of
human
life
at
seventy
and
if
it
is
very
long
at
eighty
years
and
what
is
more
noticeable
still
herodotus
i
and
iii
says
the
same
thing
but
this
is
wrong
and
the
error
is
due
simply
to
a
rough
and
superficial
estimate
of
the
results
of
daily
experience
for
if
the
natural
length
of
life
were
from
seventy
to
eighty
years
people
would
die
about
that
time
of
mere
old
age
now
this
is
certainly
not
the
case
if
they
die
then
they
die
like
younger
people
and
disease
is
something
abnormal
therefore
it
is
not
natural
to
die
at
that
age
it
is
only
when
they
are
between
ninety
and
a
hundred
that
people
die
of
old
age
die
i
mean
without
suffering
from
any
disease
or
showing
any
special
signs
of
their
condition
such
as
a
struggle
convulsion
pallor
the
absence
of
all
which
constitutes
the
natural
length
of
human
life
is
a
hundred
years
and
in
assigning
that
limit
the
upanishads
are
right
once
more
a
man
individual
career
is
not
as
astrology
wishes
to
make
out
to
be
predicted
from
observation
of
the
planets
but
the
course
of
human
life
in
general
as
far
as
the
various
periods
of
it
are
concerned
may
be
likened
to
the
succession
of
the
planets
so
that
we
may
be
said
to
pass
under
the
influence
of
each
one
of
them
in
turn
at
ten
is
in
the
ascendant
and
at
that
age
a
youth
like
this
planet
is
characterized
by
extreme
mobility
within
a
narrow
sphere
where
trifles
have
a
great
effect
upon
him
but
under
the
guidance
of
so
crafty
and
eloquent
a
god
he
easily
makes
great
progress
begins
her
sway
during
his
twentieth
year
and
then
a
man
is
wholly
given
up
to
the
love
of
women
at
thirty
comes
to
the
front
and
he
is
now
all
energy
and
strength
daring
pugnacious
and
arrogant
when
a
man
reaches
the
age
of
forty
he
is
under
the
rule
of
the
four
that
is
to
say
his
life
has
gained
something
in
extension
he
is
frugal
in
other
words
by
the
help
of
he
favors
what
is
useful
he
has
his
own
hearth
by
the
influence
of
has
taught
him
that
which
is
necessary
for
him
to
know
and
his
wife
his
rules
as
the
mistress
of
his
house
but
at
the
age
of
fifty
is
the
dominant
influence
at
that
period
a
man
has
outlived
most
of
his
contemporaries
and
he
can
feel
himself
superior
to
the
generation
about
him
he
is
still
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
his
strength
and
rich
in
experience
and
knowledge
and
if
he
has
any
power
and
position
of
his
own
he
is
endowed
with
authority
over
all
who
stand
in
his
immediate
surroundings
he
is
no
more
inclined
to
receive
orders
from
others
he
wants
to
take
command
himself
the
work
most
suitable
to
him
now
is
to
guide
and
rule
within
his
own
sphere
this
is
the
point
where
jupiter
culminates
and
where
the
man
of
fifty
years
is
at
his
best
then
comes
at
about
the
age
of
sixty

weight
as
of
dull
and
slow

folks

feign
as
they
were
dead
unwieldy

as
the
saying

a
man
goes
to
heaven
i
can
not
find
a
place
for
as
this
planet
has
been
very
thoughtlessly
named
because
i
may
not
call
it
as
it
should
be
called
otherwise
i
should
point
out
how
beginning
and
end
meet
together
and
how
closely
and
intimately
eros
is
connected
with
death
how
orcus

the
egyptians
called

is
not
only
the
receiver
but
the
giver
of
all
things

death
is
the
great
reservoir
of
life
everything
comes
from

everything

alive

we
but
understand
the
great
trick
by

that

done
