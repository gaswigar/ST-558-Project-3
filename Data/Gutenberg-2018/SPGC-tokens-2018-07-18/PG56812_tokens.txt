preface
in

volume
are
contained
the
annals
of
all
the
many
campaigns
of
with
the
exception
of
those
of
suchet
s
valencian
expedition
in
the
later
months
of
the
year
which
for
reasons
of
space
have
to
be
relegated
to
volume
it
was
impossible
to
exceed
the
bulk
of
pages
and
the
operations
on
the
mediterranean
coast
of
spain
can
be
dealt
with
separately
without
any
grave
breach
of
continuity
in
the
narrative
though
this
particular
valencian
campaign
affected
the
general
course
of
the
war
far
more
closely
than
any
other
series
of
operations
on
the
eastern
side
of
the
peninsula
as
i
have
been
careful
to
point
out
in
the
concluding
chapters
of
section
xxix
the
main
interest
of
however
centres
in
the
operations
of
wellington
and
his
opponents
masséna
soult
and
marmont
in
the
previous
year
the
tide
of
french
conquest
reached
its
mark
when
soult
appeared
before
the
walls
of
cadiz
and
masséna
forced
his
way
to
the
foot
of
the
long
chain
of
redoubts
that
formed
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
already
before
was
over
masséna
s
baffled
army
had
fallen
back
a
few
miles
and
this
first
short
retreat
to
santarem
marked
the
commencement
of
a
ebb
of
the
wave
of
conquest
on
the
western
side
of
the
peninsula
matters
went
otherwise
on
the
eastern
coast
in
but
all
suchet
s
campaigns
were
after
all
a
side
issue
the
decisive
point
lay
not
in
catalonia
or
valencia
but
in
portugal
when
masséna
finally
evacuated
portugal
in
march
forced
out
of
his
cantonments
by
wellington
s
skilful
use
of
the
sword
of
famine
a
new
stage
in
the
war
began
the
french
had
lost
the
advantage
of
the
offensive
and
were
never
to
regain
it
on
the
western
theatre
of
war
all
through
the
remainder
of
it
was
the
british
general
who
dealt
the
strokes
and
the
enemy
who
had
to
parry
them
the
strokes
were
feeble
because
of
wellington
s
very
limited
resources
and
for
the
most
part
were
warded
off
though
almeida
fell
in
may
the
siege
of
badajoz
in
june
and
the
blockade
of
ciudad
rodrigo
in
august
and
september
were
both
brought
to
an
end
by
the
concentration
of
french
armies
which
wellington
was
too
weak
to
attack
but
the
masses
of
men
which
soult
and
marmont
gathered
on
the
guadiana
in
june
and
dorsenne
and
marmont
gathered
on
the
agueda
in
september
had
only
been
collected
by
a
dangerous
disgarnishing
of
the
whole
of
those
provinces
of
spain
which
lay
beneath
the
french
yoke
they
could
not
remain
long
assembled
firstly
because
they
could
not
feed
themselves
and
secondly
because
of
the
peril
to
which
their
concentration
exposed
the
abandoned
regions
in
their
rear
hence
in
each
case
the
french
commanders
satisfied
with
having
parried
wellington
s
stroke
for
the
moment
refused
to
attack
him
and
dispersed
their
armies
that
the
spirit
of
the
offensive
was
lost
on
the
french
side
is
sufficiently
shown
by
the
fact
that
when
their
adversary
stood
on
the
defensive
upon
the
caya
in
june
and
at
alfayates
in
september
they
refused
to
assail
his
positions
we
leave
the
allied
and
the
french
armies
at
the
end
of
the
autumn
campaign
of
still
in
this
state
of
equipoise
wellington
had
made
two
successive
attempts
to
strike
and
had
failed
though
without
any
grave
loss
or
disaster
because
the
forces
opposed
to
him
were
still
too
great
his
third
stroke
in
january
was
to
be
successful
and
decisive
but
its
history
belongs
to
our
next
volume
the
main
bulk
of
the
seven
sections
herewith
presented
consists
of
a
narrative
of
the
successive
phases
of
the
long
deadlock
between
wellington
and
his
enemies
along
the
portuguese
frontier
but
i
have
endeavoured
to
give
as
clear
a
narrative
as
i
can
compile
of
all
the
of
the
year
in
andalusia
murcia
estremadura
galicia
the
asturias
and
catalonia
and
to
show
their
bearings
on
the
general
history
of
the
great
peninsular
struggle
i
must
apologize
for
the
long
space
of
time
three
years
that
has
elapsed
between
the
appearance
of
the
third
and
the
fourth
volumes
of
this
work
but
it
was
impossible
to
produce
these
sections
till
i
had
taken
two
more
voyages
over
the
more
important
of
one
round
catalonia
the
other
along
the
line
of
masséna
s
retreat
from
portugal
it
was
only
in
the
last
days
of
september
that
i
was
able
to
accomplish
the
latter
journey
it
was
made
under
the
happiest
conditions
for
the
government
of
king
manuel
kindly
lent
me
a
and
put
at
my
disposition
the
services
of
captain
teixeira
botelho
an
admirable
specialist
on
the
artillery
side
of
the
peninsular
war
guided
by
him
and
accompanied
by
my
friend
rafael
reynolds
of
barreiro
i
was
able
to
study
the
topography
of
pombal
redinha
condeixa
casal
novo
and
foz
do
arouce
not
to
speak
of
many
other
picturesque
spots
of
military
interest
hence
my
survey
of
the
main
of
has
been
fairly
complete
i
spent
long
days
at
fuentes
de
oñoro
and
albuera
walked
all
round
badajoz
and
the
field
of
the
gebora
and
studied
tarragona
and
other
catalan
sites
barrosa
alone
i
regret
to
say
i
have
not
been
able
to
visit
i
have
to
offer
grateful
thanks
to
many
possessors
of
documents
who
have
been
good
enough
to
place
them
at
my
disposition
the
most
important
of
all
were
the
d
urban
papers
lent
to
me
by
d
urban
of
newport
house
near
exeter
the
diary
and
official
correspondence
of
his
grandfather
sir
benjamin
d
urban
beresford
s
during
the
estremaduran
campaigns
of
were
simply
invaluable
for
the
comprehension
of
those
operations
i
had
already
acknowledged
my
indebtedness
to
the
d
urban
papers
in
my
narrative
of
but
in
the
following
year
when
beresford
was
acting
as
the
leader
of
an
independent
army
they
were
even
more
important
as
my
constant
references
to
them
in
notes
will
show
a
new
source
of
high
value
came
to
my
knowledge
last
year
through
the
kindness
of
scovell
of
hove
who
placed
in
my
hands
the
papers
of
his
grandfather
major
scovell
who
acted
in
as
wellington
s
not
only
was
this
officer
s
personal
diary
of
great
use
to
me
but
the
file
of
the
intercepted
french
dispatches
in
cipher
with
the
interpretation
of
them
worked
out
with
infinite
pains
proved
as
valuable
as
it
was
interesting
many
of
the
originals
written
on
small
scraps
of
the
thinnest
paper
and
folded
into
such
minute
shapes
that
they
could
be
sewed
on
to
a
button
or
hidden
in
a
coatseam
had
evidently
been
taken
on
the
persons
of
emissaries
of
the
french
generals
who
had
been
captured
by
the
guerrilleros
and
had
probably
in
most
cases
cost
the
bearers
their
lives
the
ciphers
were
of
two
sorts
in
the
more
complicated
every
word
was
in
cipher
in
the
less
complicated
only
names
of
persons
and
places
and
the
numbers
of
troops
or
dates
were
disguised
the
bulk
of
the
dispatch
being
in
plain
french
in
the
key
to
these
last
there
were
several
hundred
arbitrary
numbers
used
and
it
was
major
scovell
s
task
to
make
out
from
the
context
or
the
repetition
of
the
same
figures
in
many
documents
what
the
individual
numbers
meant
by
the
end
of
his
researches
he
had
identified
of
the
names
and
those
which
he
had
not
all
belonged
to
unimportant
persons
or
places
infrequently
mentioned
a
much
shorter
but
quite
interesting
file
of
diary
and
letters
placed
at
my
disposal
were
those
of
cornet
francis
hall
of
the
light
dragoons
they
practically
covered
only
the
year
but
were
very
full
and
written
in
an
animated
descriptive
style
very
different
from
that
of
many
dry
and
short
journals
they
contained
by
far
the
best
account
of
the
cavalry
part
of
the
fighting
at
fuentes
de
oñoro
that
i
have
ever
seen
and
i
am
exceedingly
obliged
to
the
writer
s
granddaughter
miss
hall
for
allowing
me
to
utilize
them
i
am
still
occasionally
using
notes
of
made
from
two
collections
of
unpublished
letters
of
which
i
had
occasion
to
speak
in
my
last
preface
those
of
general
le
marchant
now
in
the
hands
of
sir
henry
le
marchant
of
chobham
and
those
of
general
john
wilson
belonging
to
commander
bertram
chambers
to
both
of
the
courteous
possessors
of
these
files
of
correspondence
i
owe
my
best
thanks
i
must
mention
as
in
previous
volumes
much
kind
help
given
me
by
those
connected
with
the
military
archives
of
paris
madrid
and
lisbon
once
more
i
must
acknowledge
the
unfailing
kindness
of
martinien
at
the
french
war
ministry
who
did
so
much
to
make
easy
for
me
endless
searches
through
the
overflowing
of
its
library
at
madrid
commandant
juan
arzadun
of
the
artillery
museum
placed
much
suggestive
material
at
my
disposal
and
found
me
one
or
two
scarce
books
while
major
emilio
figueras
at
the
war
ministry
searched
out
and
copied
for
me
a
number
of
unpublished
morning
states
of
the
various
spanish
armies
i
must
also
recur
to
the
name
of
captain
teixeira
botelho
of
the
portuguese
artillery
my
companion
on
the
line
of
masséna
s
retreat
who
furnished
me
with
a
rich
mine
of
information
in
his
unpublished
para
a
historia
da
artilheria
among
my
english
helpers
i
must
give
a
special
word
of
thanks
to
major
john
leslie
to
whose
researches
i
owe
all
that
i
know
about
the
british
artillery
in
the
peninsular
war
his
dickson
papers
are
always
at
my
elbow
and
i
owe
him
particular
gratitude
for
the
artillery
appendix
xxiv
which
he
has
been
good
enough
to
compile
for
me
to
the
hon
john
fortescue
the
historian
of
the
british
army
whom
we
were
proud
to
welcome
at
oxford
as
ford
lecturer
this
year
i
am
deeply
indebted
for
his
answers
to
my
queries
on
many
dark
points
and
most
especially
for
his
notes
as
to
several
suppressed
parts
of
the
rafael
reynolds
of
barreiro
who
shared
in
my
september
tour
of
last
year
has
obtained
for
me
in
lisbon
a
number
of
rare
portuguese
volumes
most
especially
a
complete
set
of
marshal
beresford
s
do
for
the
whole
peninsular
war
an
almost
unprocurable
collection
containing
every
general
order
report
of
a
court
martial
list
of
promotions
and
statistical
paper
which
was
issued
to
the
portuguese
army
it
is
absolutely
invaluable
for
identifying
names
and
dates
and
settling
questions
of
organization
the
rev
alexander
craufurd
grandson
of
the
famous
commander
of
the
light
division
has
continued
as
in
previous
years
to
place
his
store
of
information
concerning
the
campaigns
of
that
hard
fighting
unit
at
my
disposal
lastly
the
compiler
of
the
index
a
weary
task
executed
under
many
difficulties
must
receive
my
heartfelt
thanks
for
much
loving
labour
i
must
apologize
to
readers
for
some
occasional
discrepancies
in
spelling
which
may
be
discovered
in
the
text
and
maps
they
are
mainly
due
to
the
fact
that
all
along
the
frontier
every
town
and
village
is
spelt
differently
by
its
own
inhabitants
and
by
its
close
neighbours
of
the
other
nationality
i
find
it
impossible
to
avoid
the
occasional
intrusion
of
a
portuguese
spelling
of
a
spanish
locality
and
vice
versa
matters
are
made
still
more
hard
by
the
fact
that
the
spelling
of
local
names
in
portugal
less
so
in
spain
seems
to
have
been
much
changed
since
it
is
difficult
to
avoid
occasionally
an
archaic
or
on
the
other
hand
a
form
for
a
name
these
slight
errors
or
discrepancies
between
names
as
spelled
in
the
text
and
in
the
maps
were
nearly
all
caused
by
alterations
between
the
received
spelling
of
followed
in
the
maps
i
used
and
that
of
i
do
not
think
that
they
will
cause
any
difficulty
to
the
reader
who
will
not
find
it
hard
to
recognize
that
foz
do
arouce
is
the
same
as
foz
de
arouce
or
casal
novo
as
cazal
novo
in
a
few
cases
the
critic
may
find
a
slight
difference
in
the
numbers
of
troops
or
of
killed
and
wounded
which
are
given
in
the
text
and
in
the
appendices
in
almost
all
cases
this
results
from
the
fact
that
the
official
totals
quoted
in
the
text
turned
out
not
to
work
out
in
exact
agreement
with
the
detailed
list
of
items
in
the
morning
states
or
the
complete
casualty
lists
these
errors
always
trifling
could
not
be
discovered
till
the
arithmetic
of
the
appendices
had
been
verified
sometimes
when
the
text
had
already
been
printed
off
the
most
frequent
discrepancies
were
found
in
comparing
wellington
s
totals
of
portuguese
strengths
or
casualties
with
the
detailed
official
figures
in
all
instances
the
differences
are
small
but
the
appendices
must
be
taken
to
give
the
more
exact
numbers

the

december
on
the
of
november
masséna
had
completed
the
movement
to
the
rear
which
he
had
commenced
on
the
his
army
no
longer
threatened
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
he
had
abandoned
the
offensive
for
the
defensive
concentrated
in
the
triangle
with
his
three
corps
so
disposed
that
a
march
of
twenty
miles
would
suffice
to
concentrate
everything
save
outlying
detachments
he
waited
to
see
whether
his
enemy
would
dare
to
attack
him
for
he
still
hoped
for
a
battle
in
the
open
field
and
was
prepared
to
accept
its
chances
at
bussaco
so
he
reasoned
his
defeat
had
been
the
result
of
an
attack
on
a
strong
position
the
event
might
go
otherwise
if
he
threw
the
responsibility
of
the
offensive
on
wellington
he
had
secured
for
himself
an
advantageous
his
left
flank
was
protected
by
the
formidable
entrenchments
around
santarem
his
front
was
covered
by
the
valley
of
the
rio
mayor
which
during
the
winter
season
could
be
crossed
only
at
a
few
points
his
right
wing
could
not
be
turned
unless
his
adversary
were
ready
to
push
a
great
force
over
villainous
roads
towards
alcanhede
and
the
upper
course
of
the
rio
mayor
and
if
wellington
should
risk
a
large
detachment
in
this
direction
it
might
be
possible
to
burst
out
from
santarem
against
the
containing
force
which
he
would
be
compelled
to
leave
on
the
banks
of
the
tagus
about
cartaxo
and
to
beat
it
back
towards
the
lines
a
movement
which
would
almost
certainly
bring
back
the
turning
column
from
the
north
for
the
english
general
could
not
dare
to
leave
lisbon
exposed
to
the
chances
of
a
sudden
blow
when
there
was
little
but
portuguese
militia
left
to
occupy
the
long
chain
of
defensive
works
from
alhandra
to
torres
vedras
for
some
weeks
after
his
retreat
to
his
new
position
at
santarem
masséna
lived
in
hopes
that
wellington
would
either
deliver
an
attack
on
his
front
or
undertake
the
dangerous
turning
movement
towards
his
left
no
such
chance
was
granted
him
his
adversary
had
weighed
all
the
arguments
for
and
against
the
offensive
and
had
made
up
his
mind
to
rely
rather
on
his
old
weapon
starvation
than
on
force
in
several
of
his
december
dispatches
he
sums
up
the
situation
with
perfect
clearness
on
the
he
wrote
to
lord
liverpool
it
would
still
be
impossible
to
make
any
movement
of
importance
upon
the
right
flank
of
the
enemy
s
position
at
santarem
without
exposing
some
divisions
of
troops
to
be
insulated
and
cut
off
the
enemy
having
concentrated
their
army
about
torres
novas
i
do
not
propose
to
make
any
movement
by
which
i
incur
the
risk
of
involving
the
army
in
a
general
action
on
ground
less
advantageous
than
that
which
i
had
fixed
upon
to
bring
this
contest
to
an
issue
the
lines
the
enemy
can
be
relieved
from
the
difficulties
of
their
situation
only
by
the
occurrence
of
some
misfortune
to
the
allied
army
and
i
should
forward
their
views
by
placing
the
fate
of
the
campaign
on
the
result
of
a
general
action
on
ground
chosen
by
them
and
not
on
that
selected
by
me
i
therefore
propose
to
continue
the
operation
of
light
detachments
on
their
flanks
and
rear
to
confine
them
as
much
as
possible
but
to
engage
in
no
serious
affair
on
ground
on
which
the
result
can
be
at
all
doubtful
at
the
end
of
the
month
he
simply
restates
his
decision
having
such
an
enemy
to
contend
with
and
knowing
as
i
do
that
there
is
no
army
in
the
peninsula
capable
of
contending
with
the
enemy
excepting
that
under
my
command
that
there
are
no
means
of
replacing
any
large
losses
i
might
sustain
and
that
any
success
acquired
by
a
large
sacrifice
of
men
would
be
followed
by
disastrous
consequence
to
the
cause
of
the
allies
i
have
determined
to
persevere
in
the
system
which
has
hitherto
saved
all
and
which
will
i
hope
end
in
the
defeat
of
the
enemy

from
cartaxo

also
to
lord
liverpool
cartaxo
december
accordingly
wellington
s
main
army
was
kept
for
the
three
winter
months
of
december
january
and
february
almost
precisely
on
the
same
ground
on
which
it
had
been
placed
in
the
last
week
of
november
the
three
british
cavalry
brigades
formed
a
line
in
front
of
the
whole
reaching
from
porto
de
mugem
on
the
tagus
to
são
joão
de
ribiera
on
the
upper
rio
mayor
the
infantry
divisions
save
the
were
arranged
in
successive
lines
of
cantonment
behind
them
watching
the
course
of
the
rio
mayor
while
the
reserves
had
retired
as
far
as
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
practically
the
whole
force
could
be
concentrated
in
a
single
march
or
a
march
and
a
half
at
most
in
case
masséna
should
take
the
improbable
but
still
conceivable
step
of
sallying
out
from
santarem
to
resume
the
offensive
when
the
first
french
reinforcements
began
to
come
up
about
the
new
year
of
such
a
sally
seemed
to
wellington
quite
worth
guarding
against
the
disposition
of
the
infantry
was
as
follows
on
the
right
near
the
tagus
lay
the
light
division
immediately
in
front
of
santarem
quartered
in
valle
and
other
villages
on
the
left
the
front
line
was
formed
by
pack
s
portuguese
who
lay
at
almoster
on
heights
overlooking
the
middle
course
of
the
rio
mayor
in
support
of
the
light
division
but
five
miles
to
the
rear
at
cartaxo
and
other
places
was
the
large
and
powerful
division
bayonets
the
division
lay
at
an
equal
distance
behind
the
at
azambuja
and
aveiras
da
cima
behind
pack
on
the
inland
or
leiria
road
picton
and
his
division
were
placed
at
alcoentre
their
support
was
the
division
at
torres
vedras
in
the
old
lines
seventeen
miles
to
the
rear
from
which
a
circuitous
road
led
to
alcoentre
finally
the
division
was
placed
at
the
other
end
of
the
lines
but
just
outside
them
at
alemquer
and
arruda
with
le
cor
s
portuguese
division
immediately
behind
at

on

wellington
to
liverpool
december
whatever
may
be
masséna
s
opinion
of
his
chance
of
success
in
an
attack
on
the
allied
army
i
am
convinced
that
he
will
make
it
if
he
receives
orders
from
paris
whatever
the
amount
of
the
reinforcements
sent
to
vii
in
all
the
main
army
consisted
of
about
men
of
all
arms
but
this
did
not
compose
the
whole
of
wellington
s
available
resources
he
had
transferred
a
considerable
detachment
to
the
southern
bank
of
the
tagus
to
protect
the
alemtejo
against
any
possible
descent
by
the
french
it
will
be
remembered
that
as
early
as
the
beginning
of
november
he
had
sent
across
the
river
fane
s
portuguese
cavalry
and
a
battalion
of
caçadores
who
were
directed
to
watch
the
road
along
the
further
bank
to
prevent
any
trifling
force
of
french
from
crossing
in
search
of
provisions
and
to
keep
open
the
communications
with
abrantes
as
long
as
masséna
was
threatening
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
there
was
no
danger
that
he
would
throw
anything
more
than
a
raiding
party
across
the
tagus
he
would
want
every
man
for
the
great
assault
but
when
the
marshal
gave
up
the
offensive
and
retired
to
santarem
the
aspect
of
affairs
was
changed
it
was
quite
possible
that
with
his
army
in
a
state
of
he
might
venture
to
send
a
considerable
detachment
over
the
river
to
gather
the
food
which
was
so
necessary
to
him
nor
was
it
unlikely
that
he
might
have
a
still
more
cogent
reason
for
invading
the
alemtejo
if
as
wellington
thought
probable
the
army
of
andalusia
were
to
be
ordered
up
to
assist
the
army
of
portugal
it
would
be
of
great
importance
for
the
latter
to
possess
a
footing
on
the
left
bank
of
the
tagus
as
the
communication
with
soult
s
troops
must
certainly
be
made
in
this
direction
accordingly
there
was
good
reason
for
securing
the
line
of
the
river
and
for
cooping
up
masséna
in
his
limited
sphere
on
its
western
bank
on
the
of
november
hill
and
the
division
attended
as
usual
by
hamilton
s
two
portuguese
brigades
and
with
the
light
dragoons
attached
crossed
the
tagus
in
boats
a
little
to
the
north
of
salvaterra
to
reinforce
fane
s
detachment
this
was
a
serious
force
men
which
wellington
could
ill
spare
and
he
made
elaborate
arrangements
to
enable
it
to
return
in
haste
in
the
event
of
masséna
s
once
more
taking
the
offensive
on
the
western
bank
of
the
tagus
the
flotilla
of
gunboats
and
river
craft
which
had
been
guarding
the
river
was
to
be
kept
ready
at
alhandra
to
bring
back
the
division
at
the
first
alarm
of
a
movement
of
the
french
from
santarem
meanwhile
hill
moved
up
the
river
and
established
his
head
quarters
at
chamusca
a
little
north
of
santarem
from
which
point
he
could
both
observe
the
main
body
of
the
french
and
impede
any
attempt
that
they
might
make
to
cross
the
river
and
also
could
keep
in
touch
with
abrantes
and
reinforce
it
supposing
that
masséna
showed
any
signs
of
molesting
it

vol

the
first
hint
of
this
occurs
in
a
letter
to
lord
liverpool
from
cartaxo
december
in
which
wellington
thinks
it
not
improbable
that
a
large
part
if
not
the
whole
of
the
french
army
of
andalusia
may
be
introduced
into
the
southern
part
of
this
kingdom

these
arrangements
are
taken
from
the
unpublished
diary
of

was
disabled
by
a
severe
attack

the
control
of
all
the
troops
beyond
the
tagus
devolved
on
his
senior
brigadier
william
stewart
wellington
only
allowed
this
but
somewhat
too
venturesome
officer
to
retain
his
very
responsible
command
for
a
few
weeks
troubled
by
stewart
s
constant
requests
to
be
allowed
to
make
offensive
movements
against
the
french
which
did
not
enter
into
his
own
plans
and
dreading
the
consequences
of
his
enterprise
the
superseded
him
by
sending
over
beresford
to
take
the
charge
of
all
the
forces
on
the
alemtejo
bank
of
the
tagus
december
he
would
have
preferred
to
give
the
duty
to
hill
who
had
in
the
preceding
summer
carried
out
a
similar
task
with
complete
success
while
he
watched
reynier
from
castello
branco
but
hill
s
fever
lingered
on
for
many
weeks
and
when
he
was
convalescent
the
medical
men
insisted
that
he
must
return
to
england
for
change
of
air
this
he
did
in
february
and
we
miss
his
familiar
name
in

beresford
therefore
began
with
the
new
year
to
exercise
a
command
over
the
detached
force
beyond
the
tagus
which
he
was
to
retain
for
nearly
six
months
the
experiment
of
giving
him
this
responsible
duty
was
not
altogether
a
happy
one
and
after
his
unsuccessful
operations
in
estremadura
and
his
victory
at
albuera
wellington
withdrew
him
to
other
duties
in
june
and
once
more
handed
over
the
troops
south
of
the
tagus
to
the
cautious
yet
capable
hands
of

beresford
s
detachment
observed
its
left
flank
along
the
tagus
but
this
was
not
all
wellington
had
also
taken
his
precautions
to
cast
around
the
rear
of
the
irregular
parallelogram
held
by
the
french
a
screen
of
light
troops
which
effectually
cut
their
communications
with
spain
and
restricted
though
they
could
not
altogether
hinder
their
marauding
raids
in
search
of
provisions
this
screen
was
weakest
beyond
abrantes
on
the
line
of
the
zezere
but
here
the
land
was
barren
and
the
enemy
had
little
or
nothing
to
gain
by
plundering
excursions
the
castello
branco
country
was
only
guarded
by
its
own
ordenança
levy
which
was
trifling
in
force
as
the
whole
corregedoria
from
the
zezere
to
the
elga
had
only
souls
and
it
had
sent
its
two
militia
regiments
within
the
lisbon
lines
but
save
in
the
small
upland
plain
about
castello
branco
itself
there
was
practically
neither
population
nor
tillage
the
less
barren
and
deserted
mountain
land
between
the
zezere
and
the
mondego
was
much
more
worth
plundering
and
was
protected
by
the
militia
brigade
of
john
wilson
who
lay
at
espinhal
on
the
road
with
a
force
of
four
battalions
which
ought
to
have
numbered
men
but
often
shrank
down
to
for
the
militiamen
unpaid
and
deserted
freely
during
the
winter
season
and
as
their
homes
lay
far
northward
by
the
douro
it
was
not
easy
to
gather
them
back
to
their
colours
but
wilson
had
always
a
sufficient
nucleus
about
him
to
check
any
marauding
party
that
fell
short
of
a
regiment
and
was
a
real
restraint
on
the
foragers
of
the
corps
when
they
pushed
out
from
ourem
or
thomar
to
gather
food
he
was
only
once
seriously
engaged
when
on
december
general
marcognet
with
two
battalions
and
a
cavalry
regiment
came
up
against
him
drove
him
out
of
espinhal
after
some
skirmishing
and
pushed
a
reconnaissance
as
far
as
the
mondego
of
which
we
shall
hear
in
its
due
place
beyond
wilson
to
the
west
the
line
of
observation
was
taken
up
by
trant
s
militia
brigade
which
lay
at
coimbra
to
which
town
many
of
its
fugitive
inhabitants
had
by
this
time
returned
he
had
a
larger
force
than
wilson
seven
militia
regiments
whose
strength
varied
from
day
to
day
but
seldom
fell
below
men
with
this
irregular
force
he
watched
the
line
of
the
lower
mondego
keeping
pickets
out
some
way
to
the
south
of
the
river
as
far
as
louriçal
and
redinha
they
were
only
once
driven
in
when
on
one
of
montbrun
s
dragoon
regiments
pushed
up
the
high
road
and
verified
the
fact
that
all
the
passages
of
the
lower
mondego
including
the
bridge
of
coimbra
were
guarded
the
last
link
in
the
chain
of
detachments
which
wellington
had
cast
around
the
french
was
the
garrison
of
the
fortress
of
peniche
between
lisbon
and
the
mouth
of
the
mondego
it
was
held
by
the
dépôts
of
several
infantry
regiments
of
the
regular
army
under
general
blunt
of
the
portuguese
service
not
by
any
single
organized
unit
but
there
were
some
or
recruits
more
or
less
trained
in
the
place
and
the
enterprising
major
fenwick
whom
blunt
had
put
in
charge
of
his
kept
large
pickets
out
in
the
direction
of
caldas
and
obidos
which
frequently
came
in
contact
with
the
raiding
parties
of
the
corps
and
did
them
much
harm
fenwick
was
mortally
wounded
in
action
near
obidos
on
but
the
forward
position
of
these
outposts
of
the
peniche
garrison
was
maintained
and
the
french
could
never
forage
in
the
for
a
radius
of
some
fifteen
miles
around
that
fortress
though
they
moved
as
they
pleased
about
leiria
and
the
deserted
abbeys
of
batalha
and
alcobaça
the
portuguese
outposts
at
caldas
were
in
close
and
regular
touch
with
anson
s
cavalry
pickets
from
são
joão
de
ribiera
on
the
rio
mayor
mentioned
in
wellington
s
dispatch
of
december
to

the
date
december
is
fixed
by

urban
s
diary
for
exploits
of
fenwick
in
november
and
december
see
tomkinson
s
pp
and
it
will
be
seen
therefore
that
the
limited
space
in
which
masséna
s
army
could
seek
its
living
was
a
parallelogram
bounded
by
the
tagus
on
the
south
the
lower
zezere
on
the
east
the
rio
mayor
and
the
alcoa
the
river
of
alcobaça
on
the
west
and
on
the
north
by
an
irregular
line
drawn
from
leiria
through
pombal
to
cabaços
near
the
zezere
outside
these
limits
food
could
only
be
got
by
large
detachments
moving
with
all
military
precautions
and
obliged
to
keep
up
a
constant
running
fight
with
the
portuguese
militia
the
profit
from
such
expeditions
whose
march
was
necessarily
very
slow
was
so
small
that
masséna
sent
out
very
few
of
them
since
the
peasantry
got
off
with
their
flocks
into
the
hills
whenever
the
first
skirmishing
shots
along
the
high
road
were
heard
the
sustenance
of
the
french
was
mainly
obtained
by
harrying
and
the
area
bounded
by
the
limits
stated
above
where
they
could
work
their
will
without
meeting
with
any
resistance
there
was
very
little
change
in

the
three
months
of

and
watching

of

its
front
post
was
at

beyond

only
five
miles
from

remaining

were
ranged
along

far

as

certain

had
one
infantry
regiment
lent
by

their
main
duty
was
to
watch
and
restrain
trant

with
whose
advanced
posts
they
were
always
bickering
the
situation
of
the
french
army
was
remarkably
compact
ney

division
at
golegão
was
only
one
long
march
eighteen
miles
behind

his
second
division
at
thomar
was
less
than
two
marches
miles
behind

only
loison
could
not
have
been
brought
up
at
short
notice
supposing
that
wellington
had
attacked
the
line
of
the
rio
mayor
if
on
the
other
hand
an
force
had
debouched
from
abrantes
to
attack
loison
no
impossible
plan
and
one
that
william
stewart
had
strenuously
urged
wellington
to
adopt

division
at
punhete
could
have
been
reinforced
from
golegão
and
thomar
in
one
march
since
the
former
of
these
places
is
about
thirteen
miles
from
the
zezere
and
the
latter
not
more
than
ten
masséna
s
dispositions
as
can
be
seen
at
a
glance
were
purely
defensive
they
could
not
be
otherwise
when
his
army
had
dwindled
down
by
the
beginning
of
december
to
efficient
sabres
and
bayonets
while
his
hospitals
were
encumbered
by
or
sick
all
that
he
aspired
to
do
was
to
hold
on
in
the
mayor
position
pinning
his
adversary
down
to
the
neighbourhood
of
lisbon
till
he
should
be
restored
to
the
power
of
taking
the
offensive
once
more
by
the
arrival
of
reinforcements
his
aid
must
come
on
one
side
from
soult
and
the
army
of
andalusia
on
the
other
from
drouet
s
corps
whose
services
had
been
promised
to
him
by
the
emperor
long
before
the
invasion
of
portugal
began
but
down
to
the
end
of
the
year
he
had
not
the
slightest
breath
of
information
as
to
whether
this
assistance
was
close
at
hand
or
whether
it
had
perchance
not
even
begun
to
move
in
his
direction
since
he
had
cut
himself
loose
from
the
frontier
of
spain
in
september
not
a
single
dispatch
had
reached
him
not
even
a
secret
emissary
had
penetrated
to
his
head
quarters
for
all
that
he
knew
napoleon
might
be
dead
or
engaged
in
a
new
war
with
some
continental
enemy
it
is
an
astonishing
testimony
to
the
efficiency
of
the
screen
of
portuguese
ordenança
and
militia
which
wellington
had
cast
round
the
french
army
to
find
that
nothing
had
slipped
through
and
the
marshal
s
attempts
to
send
out
news
of
himself
had
been
almost
equally
well
foiled
all
his
messengers
had
been
intercepted
save
foy
who
as
it
will
be
remembered
had
forced
his
way
over
the
unfrequented
estrada
nova
road
on
october
and
foy
had
got
through
to
ciudad
rodrigo
because
he
had
been
given
such
a
large
escort
men
that
no
mere
gathering
of
local
ordenança
could
stop
him
the
next
messenger
who
got
through
was
major
casabianca
who
started
on
january
with
men
and
safely
reached
rodrigo
see
fririon
s
of
the
campaign
of
masséna
down
to
the
end
of
december
did
not
know
in
the
least
whether
foy
or
any
other
of
his
emissaries
had
got
through
he
had
simply
to
wait
till
news
should
penetrate
to
him
meanwhile
the
one
governing
preoccupation
of
his
life
was
to
get
food
for
his
army
since
if
food
failed
he
must
be
driven
to
the
disastrous
winter
retreat
across
flooded
streams
and
between
mountains
to
which
wellington
hoped
to
force
him
the
english
general
s
forecast
of
the
time
which
would
be
required
to
starve
out
the
french
army
was
wrong
by
some
eight
or
nine
weeks
he
thought
that
they
would
have
consumed
every
possible
morsel
of
food
that
could
be
scraped
together
by
december
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
held
out
till
the
end
of
february
in
a
state
of
constantly
increasing
privation
it
seems
that
wellington
underrated
both
the
capacity
for
endurance
that
the
enemy
would
show
and
still
more
the
resources
which
were
available
to
him
the
portuguese
government
had
ordered
the
peasantry
to
destroy
all
that
they
could
not
carry
off
when
the
was
evacuated
in
october
and
the
people
retired
within
the
torres
vedras
lines
ostensibly
the
decree
had
been
carried
out
but
it
was
impossible
to
induce
these
small
cultivators
to
make
away
with
good
food
the
worst
of
crimes
to
the
peasant
s
mind
the
large
majority
hid
or
buried
instead
of
burning
their
stores
trusting
to
recover
what
they
had
concealed
when
the
french
should
have
departed
many
of
the
were
very
ingenious
in
some
cases
caves
in
the
hills
had
been
used
and
their
mouths
plastered
up
with
stones
and
earth
in
others
pits
or
had
been
dug
in
unlikely
places
and
carefully
covered
up
or
cellars
had
been
filled
and
their
entrances
bricked
up
and
concealed
the
ingenuity
that
is
bred
by
an
empty
stomach
soon
set
the
french
on
the
search
for
these
hoards
when
it
was
once
discovered
that
there
was
much
hidden
grain
and
maize
in
the
country
every
man
became
a
whole
villages
were
pulled
down
in
the
search
for
secret
places
in
their
walls
or
under
their
floors
parties
scoured
every
ravine
or
hillside
where
caves
might
lurk
we
are
told
that
one
effective
plan
was
for
detachments
to
go
about
with
full
barrels
in
fields
near
houses
and
to
cast
water
all
over
the
surface
where
the
liquid
sank
in
suddenly
there
was
a
chance
that
a
lurked
below
and
the
spade
often
turned
up
a
deposit
of
hundreds
of
bushels
but
more
drastic
methods
than
these
were
soon
devised
in
the
sort
of
between
the
actual
cantonments
of
the
french
army
and
the
outposts
of
wilson
trant
and
blunt
the
population
had
not
entirely
disappeared
though
the
large
majority
had
retired
some
of
the
poorest
or
the
most
reckless
had
merely
hidden
themselves
in
the
hills
for
a
week
or
two
and
came
down
cautiously
when
the
french
had
marched
by
towards
lisbon
a
sprinkling
of
miserable
folk
lived
precariously
in
or
near
their
usual
abodes
always
ready
to
fly
or
to
conceal
themselves
when
a
foraging
party
was
reported
in
the
neighbourhood
hence
came
the
horrid
business
that
one
french
diarist
calls
the
chasse
aux
hommes
it
became
a
regular
device
for
the
marauders
to
move
by
night
hide
themselves
and
watch
for
some
unwary
peasant
when
he
was
sighted
he
was
pursued
and
often
caught
he
was
then
offered
the
choice
between
revealing
the
of
himself
and
his
neighbours
and
a
through
the
head
generally
he
yielded
and
the
party
went
back
with
their
mules
loaded
with
grain
or
driving
before
them
some
goats
and
oxen
sometimes
he
was
himself
starving
could
reveal
nothing
and
was
murdered
we
are
assured
by
more
than
one
french
narrator
of
these
hateful
times
that
it
was
discovered
that
torture
was
more
effective
than
the
mere
fear
of
death
if
the
prisoner
could
or
would
discover
nothing
he
was
hung
up
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
let
down
and
offered
a
second
chance
of
life
sometimes
this
led
to
revelations
if
not
he
was
strung
up
again
for
good
torture
by
fire
is
also
said
to
have
been
employed
on
some
occasions
for
a
description
of
this
see
s
naturally
these
atrocities
were
not
practised
under
the
eyes
of
the
officers
commanding
regular
foraging
parties
but
when
a
company
had
dispersed
in
search
of
plunder
the
men
who
were
separated
in
twos
or
threes
without
control
acted
with
such
various
degrees
of
brutality
as
suited
themselves
moreover
there
was
a
floating
scum
of
unlicensed
marauders
who
had
left
their
colours
without
leave
and
were
in
no
hurry
to
rejoin
them
these
were
responsible
for
the
worst
crimes
sometimes
they
gathered
together
in
bands
of
considerable
strength
and
it
is
said
that
they
were
known
to
fire
on
regular
foraging
parties
who
tried
to
arrest
or
restrain
them
and
that
one
troop
several
hundred
strong
fought
a
desperate
skirmish
with
a
whole
battalion
sent
to
hunt
them
down
but
it
was
not
these
as
they
were
called
who
were
the
sole
offenders
many
horrors
were
perpetrated
within
the
limits
of
the
cantonments
by
the
authorized
raiding
companies
guingret
of
the
in
ney
s
corps
mentions
in
his
diary
that
he
had
seen
such
a
detachment
return
to
camp
after
having
surprised
a
village
with
a
number
of
peasant
girls
whom
they
sold
to
their
comrades
some
for
a
couple
of
gold
pieces
others
for
a
and
assures
us
that
rape
was
habitual
when
such
a
surprise
had
succeeded
it
was
in
vain
that
masséna
and
the
issued
general
orders
prohibiting
misconduct
of
any
kind
and
even
executed
one
or
two
offenders
caught
for
the
regimental
officers
who
depended
on
the
individual
efficiency
of
their
men
in
marauding
for
their
daily
food
were
not
too
eager
to
make
inquiries
as
to
what
had
passed
outside
their
own
vision
and
the
soldier
who
brought
home
much
booty
was
not
too
closely
questioned
as
to
the
manner
in
which
he
had
obtained
it
when
a
foraging
party
had
turned
over
many
bushels
of
wheat
or
maize
or
a
hundred
sheep
to
the
store
of
their
battalion
it
could
hardly
be
expected
that
their
colonel
would
show
his
gratitude
by
inquiring
whether
the
happy
find
had
been
procured
by
torture
or
by
simple
murder

given
by

pp
is
probably
exaggerated
by
that

the
scale
is

large

there
was
undoubtedly
some
foundation
for
the
tale

of
the
three
corps
which
formed
masséna
s
army
that
of
reynier
in
the
santarem
entrenchments
seems
to
have
suffered
most
because
it
was
concentrated
on
a
narrow
position
with
no
unexhausted
country
around
it
and
with
other
troops
immediately
in

who
had
sucked
dry
the
resources
of
the
plain
of
golegão
its
foraging
parties
had
to
go
thirty
miles
away
before
they
had
a
chance
of
finding
ground
that
had
not
been
already
picked
over
most
carefully
by
the
men
of
the
or
the
corps
junot
s
men
were
a
little
better
off
as
they
had
the
country
immediately
on
their
flank
and
could
plunder
there
without
molestation
unless
they
pressed
in
too
closely
upon
the
outposts
of
trant
s
or
blunt
s
detachments
nevertheless
the
corps
lost
more
men
by
disease
than
either
of
the
others
during
this
hard
winter
it
was
composed
to
a
great
extent
of
conscript
battalions
new
to
spain
young
and
unacclimatized
whose
men
died
off
like
flies
from
cold
dysentery
and
rheumatism
clausel
s
division
which
contained
all
these
raw
units
sank
from
to
men
in
the
three
months
that
preceded
the
new
year
without
having
been
engaged
in
any
serious
fighting
a
loss
of
forty
per
cent
while
the
troops
of
reynier
who
had
been
in
the
peninsula
since
and
had
already
gone
through
the
privations
of
soult
s
marches
to
corunna
and
oporto
only
shrank
from
to
bayonets
in
the
same
three
months
moreover
of
the
lost
by
them
were
the
casualties
of
bussaco
not
the
victims
of
wellington
s
scheme
of
starvation
ney
s
corps
and
the
cavalry
reserve
were
better
off
than
either
junot
s
or
reynier
s
troops
having
at
their
disposition
the
fertile
country
between
golegão
thomar
and
abrantes
where
at
the
commencement
of
their
sojourn
food
was
to
be
got
with
comparative
ease
many
fields
of
maize
were
still
standing
unreaped
when
they
first
arrived
and
it
was
not
till
after
the
new
year
of
that
they
began
to
be
seriously
pinched
and
to
be
driven
far
afield
up
the
valley
of
the
zezere
and
into
the
mountains
in
the
direction
of
espinhal
and
coimbra
the
corps
was
still
strong
out
of
its
original
on
january
and
of
the
missing
represented
bussaco
casualties
in
actual
fighting
it
must
be
confessed
that
the
french
army
displayed
splendid
fortitude
and
ingenuity
in
maintaining
itself
on
the
tagus
so
long
beyond
the
period
of
wellington
s
estimate
that
it
did
not
altogether
dissolve
when
it
was
living
from
hand
to
mouth
with
a
fifth
or
a
quarter
of
the
men
habitually
absent
on
foraging
expeditions
is
surprising
desertions
to
the
allied
lines
save
from
the
foreign
battalions
in
loison
s
and
solignac
s
divisions
were
very
rare
the
native
french
gave
many
recruits
to
the
marauding
but
seldom
passed
over
to
the
enemy
the
regimental
officers
succeeded
in
organizing
a
regular
system
by
which
the
exploitation
of
the
was
made
as
effectual
as
could
be
managed
they
repaired
and
set
going
the
ruined
mills
discovered
and
rebuilt
the
bakers
ovens
of
every
village
and
town
and
in
most
cases
organized
regimental
which
made
them
independent
of
the
general
commissariat
for
there
was
little
or
nothing
to
be
got
from
head
quarters
shoes
proved
the
greatest
difficulty
but
the
men
learnt
to
make
rude
mocassins
or
rivlins
of
untanned
hide
which
served
fairly
well
though
they
needed
constant
replacing
in
some
regiments
a
third
of
the
men
might
be
seen
wearing
this
primitive
footgear
another
weak
point
was
ammunition
there
had
been
no
great
consumption
of
it
since
bussaco
or
the
state
of
the
army
would
have
been
perilous
indeed
since
it
had
to
depend
on
what
it
had
originally
brought
down
from
spain
in
september
no
more
had
been
received
and
attempts
to
establish
a
powder
factory
at
santarem
failed
for
lack
of
saltpetre
if
masséna
had
been
forced
to
fight
two
or
three
general
engagements
his
stores
would
have
been
so
depleted
that
he
would
have
had
to
abscond
at
once
lest
the
army
should
be
left
without
cartridges
meanwhile
he
hung
on
to
his
position
conscious
that
his
power
of
endurance
was
limited
but
hoping
at
any
moment
to
see
reinforcements
break
through
from
the
north
or
the
east
to
refill
his
ranks
and
bring
him
the
needful
convoys
see

his
and

stores
pp
see
pp
of
military
operations
as
opposed
to
mere
raids
by
detachments
in
search
of
food
hardly
anything
was
undertaken
by
the
army
of
portugal
down
to
the
end
of
the
year
between
the
and
the
of
december
general
ferey
with
five
battalions
and
a
cavalry
regiment
carried
out
a
useless
excursion
beyond
the
zezere
into
the
desolate
region
of
castello
branco
as
far
as
cortiçada
apparently
he
had
been
sent
out
because
of
rumours
that
a
french
force
was
operating
in
this
direction
and
he
was
told
to
get
into
touch
with
it
but
these
reports
were
idle
they
were
tardy
echoes
of
gardanne
s
unhappy
march
on
the
estrada
nova
a
full
month
before
the
brigade
returned
wearied
and
more
than
on
the
seventh
day
equally
destitute
of
news
and
of
the
plunder
that
it
had
hoped
to
find
in
a
hitherto
untouched
district
the
only
fruitful
action
indeed
which
the
french
carried
out
in
this
month
was
the
completion
of
the
great
at
the
mouth
of
the
zezere
which
masséna
had
ordered
general
eblé
to
construct
many
weeks
back
his
object
was
to
have
at
his
disposition
means
for
crossing
the
tagus
in
case
he
should
wish
to
invade
the
alemtejo
or
to
with
any
friendly
troops
that
might
appear
from
that
direction
originally
he
had
intended
to
make
santarem
his
but
after
some
boats
had
been
built
there
with
immense
difficulties
owing
to
the
entire
lack
of
appliances
he
determined
that
the
place
was
too
near
the
british
lines
and
too
much
exposed
to
attacks
by
wellington
s
river
flotilla
obviously
a
serious
attempt
to
cross
the
tagus
near
santarem
even
if
its
initial
stages
succeeded
and
the
larger
part
of
the
army
got
over
would
expose
the
rear
divisions
to
almost
certain
destruction
since
wellington
could
throw
men
upon
them
within
the
next
twelve
hours
there
is
no
more
certain
way
of
ruining
an
army
than
to
allow
it
to
be
caught
divided
into
two
halves
by
a
broad
river
spanned
by
one
or
two
precarious
bridges
on
the
other
hand
the
mouth
of
the
zezere
was
very
remote
from
wellington
s
main
army
and
a
crossing
made
opposite
to
it
could
only
be
opposed
by
a
part
of
beresford
s
force
which
was
not
very
large
and
was
spread
along
fifty
miles
of
the
river
front
moreover
the
corps
executing
the
passage
would
not
have
any
great
danger
on
its
flank
or
rear
since
there
was
only
the
portuguese
garrison
of
abrantes
to
molest
it
it
was
an
additional
advantage
that
a
at
punhete
could
be
kept
in
perfect
safety
a
mile
or
two
up
the
zezere
out
of
range
of
guns
on
the
further
bank
of
the
tagus
and
could
be
floated
down
at
the
last
moment
while
at
santarem
the
boats
had
to
be
stored
on
the
actual
bank
of
the
tagus
exposed
to
attacks
from
the
side
of
the
water
by
wellington
s
gunboats
one
effort
to
sink
or
fire
them
by
a
bombardment
and
the
use
of
congreve
rockets
had
already
been
made
see

accordingly
masséna
resolved
that
if
he
made
any
attempt
to
cross
into
the
alemtejo
he
would
take
punhete
and
the
estuary
of
the
zezere
as
his
here
he
established
his
dockyard
and
hither
he
transferred
most
of
the
busy
workers
from
santarem
in
the
course
of
a
month
they
got
ready
for
him
the
materials
for
two
bridges
broad
enough
to
span
the
tagus
besides
ninety
boats
the
mouth
of
the
zezere
was
protected
by
a
number
of
batteries
to
keep
down
the
fire
of
any
guns
that
beresford
might
bring
up
to
sink
the
bridges
when
they
were
being
cast
across
these
preparations
did
not
long
escape
wellington
s
notice
he
saw
that
the
ground
opposite
punhete
was
the
most
crucial
point
in
beresford
s
long
front
and
bade
him
close
up
his
troops
toward
it
the
detachment
beyond
the
tagus
was
reinforced
by
a
spanish
brigade
under
carlos
de
españa
drawn
from
la
romana
s
army
which
was
placed
at
barca
just
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
zezere
with
william
stewart
s
brigade
of
the
division
close
by
at
santa
margarida
tramagal
and
pinheiros
three
batteries
were
established
on
the
tagus
bank
opposite
punhete
and
armed
with
but
as
these
were
overmatched
by
the
french
guns
across
the
water
were
requisitioned
from
lisbon
the
rest
of
the
division
and
hamilton
s
two
portuguese
brigades
were
to
be
ready
to
march
to
support
carlos
de
españa
and
stewart
at
the
shortest
notice
these
dispositions
were
sufficient
to
keep
masséna
quiet
he
had
no
real
intention
of
crossing
the
tagus
unless
he
heard
of
soult
s
approach
from
the
direction
of
the
alemtejo
for
details
see
d
urban
s
diary
january
and
the
french
batteries
on
the
first
day
shelled
carlos
de
españa
s
cantonments
across
the
river
but
with
no
effect
so
fririon
in
his
de
on
that
side
all
was
tranquil
as
indeed
it
was
destined
to
remain
for
many
a
week
more
but
just
at
the
end
of
the
month
of
december
the
isolation
in
which
the
army
of
portugal
had
so
long
been
living
at
last
came
to
an
end
and
reinforcements
and
news
were
at
last
received
though
the
news
was
disheartening
and
the
reinforcements
inadequate
on
the
the
reconnoitring
party
under
general
marcognet
which
had
just
beaten
up
wilson
s
quarters
at
espinhal
was
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
a
party
of
regular
cavalry
pushing
towards
them
on
the
road
from
ponte
de
murcella
the
uniforms
were
soon
seen
to
be
those
of
french
dragoons
and
a
joyful
meeting
took
place
the
announced
that
they
were
the
advanced
guard
of
drouet
s
corps
which
was
pushing
down
the
valley
of
the
mondego
in
search
of
the
army
of
portugal
but
had
no
exact
knowledge
of
where
it
was
to
be
found
there
is
a
description
of
the
meeting
in
the
diary
of
ney
s
sprünglin
who
was
in
command
of
the
party
which
actually
met
d
erlon
s
dragoons
the
corps
it
will
be
remembered
was
a
promiscuous
assembly
of
some
twenty
fourth
battalions
belonging
to
the
regiments
which
were
already
in
spain
eleven
were
fractions
of
corps
serving
in
soult
s
army
of
andalusia
five
of
regiments
of
ney
s
corps
the
rest
of
units
under
reynier
s
and
junot
s
command
drouet
had
been
originally
ordered
to
do
no
more
than
conduct
these
battalions
which
were
little
better
than
a
mass
of
drafts
to
join
the
regiments
to
which
they
belonged
they
were
divided
into
two
provisional
divisions
under
generals
conroux
and
claparéde
thrust
as
it
were
into
spain
without
any
regular
organization
destitute
of
battalion
transport
and
with
an
improvised
and
insufficient
staff
they
had
made
very
slow
progress
since
they
crossed
the
pyrenees
mainly
owing
to
difficulties
of
commissariat
when
foy
passed
salamanca
on
november
the
head
of
claparéde
s
division
had
only
just
entered
that
city
the
tail
of
the
corps
was
struggling
up
from
valladolid
and
burgos
it
is
not
surprising
therefore
to
find
that
claparéde
only
reached
the
neighbourhood
of
almeida
on
the
of
november
and
that
drouet
had
not
concentrated
his
whole
force
at
that
place
till
december
he
had
about
men
having
left
three
of
his
own
battalions
to
garrison
ciudad
rodrigo
and
picked
up
instead
the
remains
of
gardanne
s
column
which
had
retreated
on
to
the
spanish
frontier
in
such
disorder
at
the
end
of
the
preceding
month
this
detachment
by
reason
of
its
losses
during
its
disastrous
flight
had
been
reduced
to
about
men
fit
for
service
about
the
same
number
that
drouet
had
left
behind
him
from
his
own
corps
drouet
was
acting
under
stringent
orders
from
the
emperor
to
move
forward
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
and
open
up
communication
with
masséna
his
original
instructions
had
been
to
go
no
further
forward
than
almeida
himself
but
to
send
a
column
under
gardanne
strong
to
clear
and
keep
open
the
way
to
the
tagus
the
march
and
failure
of
gardanne
have
been
already
related
and
drouet
saw
that
to
carry
out
the
emperor
s
orders
he
must
use
a
larger
force
at
the
same
time
his
dispatches
told
him
that
he
must
at
all
costs
keep
in
touch
with
almeida
and
not
merely
join
masséna
and
allow
himself
to
be
cut
off
from
spain
see

iii

to
berthier

and
november
and
qu
il

que
je
compte
du
reste
sur
sa
prudence
de
ne
pas
se
laisser
couper
d
napoleon
to
berthier
november
drouet
s
solution
of
the
problem
was
that
with
conroux
s
division
and
gardanne
s
detachment
some
men
he
would
march
down
the
mondego
by
celorico
and
ponte
de
murcella
and
cut
his
way
to
join
masséna
but
that
he
would
leave
his
second
division
under
claparéde
behind
him
about
celorico
and
trancoso
to
keep
in
touch
with
almeida
and
maintain
his
communications
this
was
about
as
much
as
could
be
done
to
carry
out
napoleon
s
instructions
which
were
essentially
impossible
to
execute
for
the
portuguese
militia
with
which
the
corps
had
to
deal
were
when
properly
managed
a
very
intangible
enemy
who
could
retire
whenever
a
column
passed
and
return
to
block
the
way
when
it
had
gone
by
it
is
impossible
to
see
how
drouet
could
have
kept
open
the
whole
road
from
almeida
to
thomar
without
leaving
all
along
the
way
a
couple
of
battalions
entrenched
in
a
good
position
at
distances
of
fifteen
or
twenty
miles
from
each
other
and
if
he
had
done
this
he
would
have
had
no
force
left
at
the
moment
when
he
joined
masséna
it
was
useless
for
napoleon
to
tell
him
in
one
breath
to
keep
the
road
open
from
end
to
end
and
in
the
next
to
forbid
him
to
make
any
small
detachments
but
the
emperor
neither
fully
understood
the
military
situation
in
portugal
nor
grasped
the
relative
merits
of
its
roads
or
the
relative
resources
of
its
various
regions
in
a
dispatch
sent
out
to
masséna
on
december
but
not
delivered
till
february
he
advised
that
marshal
to
try
to
open
his
communications
with
spain
by
the
awful
mountain
road
from
the
zezere
by
cardigos
and
belmonte
to
guarda
and
at
the
same
time
to
use
the
desolate
castello
branco
country
pour
faire
des
ferey
s
fruitless
expedition
up
that
very
road
and
into
that
very
region
carried
out
a
fortnight
before
the
emperor
s
dispatch
was
even
written
had
sufficiently
proved
the
futility
of
the
suggestion

est
donc
important
qu
il
ne
fasse
point
de

ibid
but
to
return
to
drouet
he
left
almeida
on
december
and
crossed
the
coa
with
both
his
divisions
and
gardanne
s
detachment
the
only
enemy
near
him
was
silveira
who
with
his
six
militia
regiments
and
the
reorganized
of
the
line
the
absconding
garrison
of
almeida
which
had
eluded
its
forced
oath
to
masséna
in
the
preceding
autumn
was
lying
at
trancoso
to
that
place
the
portuguese
general
had
retired

celorico
drouet
cut
himself
loose
from
his
lieutenant
who
in
accordance
with
napoleon
s
orders
was
to
stay
behind
to
remain
in
touch
with
almeida
and
vain
thought
to
keep
open
the
communications
taking
conroux
and
gardanne
with
him
he
marched
south
of
the
mondego
past
chamusca
and
moita
as
far
as
ponte
de
murcella
which
he
reached
on
the
he
met
with
no
opposition
for
baccelar
anxious
only
for
oporto
had
told
silveira
to
keep
in
front
of
claparéde
and
miller
to
stay
at
vizeu
but
both
to
be
ready
to
fall
back
on
oporto
if
drouet
s
advance
turned
out
to
have
that
city
as
its
objective
similarly
trant
was
to
hold
on
to
coimbra
unless
the
french
column
took
the
northern
road
in
which
case
he
too
might
be
called
back
to
oporto
between
drouet
therefore
and
masséna
s
army
there
was
only
left
the
weak
brigade
of
john
wilson
at
espinhal
and
this
force
had
been
driven
out
of
its
usual
position
by
marcognet
s
flying
column
on
november
and
had
retired
to
peñacova
beyond
the
mondego
below
the
heights
of
bussaco
on
the
drouet
s
advance
cavalry
came
into
touch
with
marcognet
as
has
been
already
related
at
espinhal
just
as
the
latter
was
preparing
to
retire
to
thomar
with
the
report
that
there
was
nothing
stirring
in
the
north
these
dispositions
are
given
in
d
urban
s
unpublished
diary
thus
drouet
s
men
came
into
the
sphere
of
masséna
s
operations
but
he
did
not
at
first
seem
to
realize
the
fact
he
sent
on
gardanne
s
detachment
which
mostly
belonged
to
the
corps
to
join
the
marshal
but
halted
conroux
s
division
at
espinhal
and
only
went
forward
in
person
as
far
as
thomar
where
he
stopped
for
two
days
conferring
with
ney
instead
of
reporting
himself
to
masséna
he
merely
sent
on
a
dispatch
to
say
that
he
had
opened
the
communications
and
was
under
orders
from
the
emperor
to
keep
them
safe
with
this
purpose
he
intended
to
return
to
the
mondego
and
get
back
into
touch
with
claparéde
masséna
was
in
no
small
degree
irritated
at
this
pretension
of
drouet
to
act
as
an
independent
commander
and
sent
him
a
peremptory
order
to
come
to
head
quarters
to
make
his
report
and
to
send
on
conroux
s
division
from
espinhal
to
occupy
leiria
after
some
slight
friction
drouet
obeyed
the
communications
with
almeida
for
a
moment
were
thus
broken
again
after
four
days
for
john
wilson
the
instant
that
conroux
began
to
break
up
from
espinhal
came
boldly
back
towards
that
place
attacked
the
french
rearguard
on
december
and
after
doing
it
some
little
harm
blocked
the
to
the
north
once
more
drouet
was
completely
cut
off
from
claparéde
and
his
arrival
brought
no
profit
to
masséna
beyond
his
men
and
the
moderate
train
of
ammunition
which
he
had
escorted
it
was
not
with
such
a
reinforcement
that
the
marshal
could
hope
to
resume
the
offensive
indeed
as
wellington
sagely
remarked
if
nothing
more
came
up
to
join
him
his
retreat
looked
more
certain
and
necessary
than
ever
for
wilson
s
movements

while
drouet
was
on
the
march
to
leiria
his
lieutenant
claparéde
the
moment
that
he
was
no
longer
under
his
superior
s
eye
had
gone
off
on
a
bold
and
rather
hazardous
raid
of
his
own
finding
that
silveira
s
militia
were
sticking
closely
to
his
skirts
he
resolved
to
make
an
attempt
to
surprise
them
by
a
forced
march
concentrating
at
trancoso
on
december
he
fell
upon
the
enemy
on
the
following
day
at
ponte
do
abbade
and
routed
them
with
a
loss
of
men
silveira
notwithstanding
this
check
adhered
to
his
orders
to
keep
close
to
claparéde
and
retired
no
further
than
villa
da
ponte
some
seven
miles
away
but
the
french
general
made
a
second
sudden
sally
from
trancoso
on
january
beat
the
portuguese
much
more
decisively
and
pursued
them
as
far
as
lamego
on
the
douro
silveira
crossed
the
river
in
great
disorder
on
the
and
the
news
of
his
defeat
brought
terror
to
oporto
baccelar
at
once
ordered
not
only
the
brigade
from
vizeu
miller
was
just
dead
and
no
longer
commanded
it
but
trant
from
coimbra
and
wilson
from
peñacova
to
fall
back
and
join
him
they
concentrated
at
castro
daire
ten
miles
south
of
lamego
with
a
force
of
bayonets
whereupon
claparéde
who
had
only
men
with
him
began
to
fear
that
he
would
be
cut
off
from
almeida
and
isolated
in
a
difficult
position
he
evacuated
lamego
and
returned
to
trancoso
by
forced
marches
having
accomplished
nothing
save
the
destruction
of
a
few
hundred
militia
and
the
spreading
of
panic
as
far
as
oporto
january
shortly
after
he
left
trancoso
and
moved
southward
to
celorico
and
guarda
where
he
commanded
the
two
roads
to
the
tagus
yet
was
not
too
far
from
almeida
and
his
base
but
he
was
still
completely
cut
off
from
masséna
and
the
portuguese
at
once
resumed
their
old
positions
around
him
trant
returning
to
coimbra
wilson
to
peñacova
on
the
mondego
while
baccelar
with
the
reserves
lay
more
to
the
rear
at
são
pedro
do
sul
on
the
vouga
claparéde
s
movement
would
have
been
dangerous
for
the
allies
if
he
had
possessed
a
heavier
force
but
men
were
too
few
for
a
serious
march
on
oporto
and
if
the
column
had
not
retreated
in
haste
it
would
probably
have
suffered
complete
disaster
chaby

gives
january
as
the
date
of
the
combat
of
villa
da
ponte
but
all
the
other
authorities
place
it
on
the
according
to
thiébault
then
commanding
at
salamanca
claparéde
s
rather
wild
excursion
was
due
to
mere
desire
for
plunder
he
accuses
him
of
having
raised
and
put
into
his
private
purse
great
contributions
at
moimento
lamego
and
other
towns
which
he
occupied
for
a
few
days
iv
date
uncertain
perhaps
january
as
wellington
knew
he
was
there
on
january
the
only
use
which
masséna
could
make
of
drouet
and
the
division
of
conroux
was
to
cover
more
ground
for
foraging
by
their
means
when
placed
at
leiria
they
much
restricted
the
activities
of
blunt
at
peniche
and
trant
at
coimbra
who
could
no
longer
push
their
advanced
posts
so
far
to
the
front
and
had
to
cede
to
the
enemy
all
the
land
about
the
souré
and
alcoa
rivers
here
drouet
collected
enough
food
both
to
feed
himself
and
to
give
help
to
ney
but
the
resources
of
the
district
were
after
all
limited
and
within
a
few
weeks
the
men
of
the
corps
were
living
on
the
edge
of
daily
starvation
like
their
fellows
the
army
of
portugal
had
got
no
solid
help
from
this
quarter
it
remained
to
be
seen
whether
they
would
obtain
better
aid
from
the
other
side

which
masséna
had
hoped
to
be
reinforced

soult
s
expedition
into
estremadura
the
battle
of
the
gebora
and
the
fall
of
badajoz
in
his
original
scheme
for
the
invasion
of
portugal
napoleon
had
given
no
part
to
the
army
of
andalusia
judging
that
masséna
supported
by
the
corps
would
be
amply
strong
enough
to
drive
the
english
into
the
sea
it
is
not
till
the
of
september
that
the
imperial
correspondence
begins
to
show
signs
of
a
desire
that
soult
should
do
something
to
help
the
army
of
portugal
but
the
assistance
which
was
to
be
given
is
defined
in
the
dispatch
of
that
date
as
no
more
than
a
diversion
to
be
made
against
estremadura
by
mortier
and
the
corps
with
the
object
of
preventing
la
romana
from
giving
any
aid
to
wellington
soult
is
directed
to
see
that
mortier
keeps
the
spanish
army
of
estremadura
in
check
he
is
always
to
be
on
its
heels
so
that
it
will
have
no
opportunity
of
sending
troops
towards
the
tagus
nothing
is
said
about
making
a
serious
attack
on
estremadura
or
of
threatening
badajoz
with
a
siege
on
the
of
october
comes
the
next
allusion
to
this
subject
the
emperor
had
learnt
from
the
english
newspapers
always
his
best
source
of
intelligence
that
la
romana
with
a
large
part
of
his
forces
has
marched
on
lisbon
to
join
wellington
and
that
he
has
been
able
to
do
so
without
molestation
that
this
should
have
happened
was
he
thought
due
to
direct
disobedience
on
soult
s
part
the
marshal
can
not
have
kept
in
touch
with
the
enemy
and
he
is
directed
in
vague
terms
to
faire
pousser
sur
la
romana
whatever
exactly
that
may
mean
an
interpretation
for
the
phrase
however
turns
up
in
the
next
imperial
dispatch
mortier
and
the
corps
ought
to
have
followed
the
spanish
general
march
for
march
and
to
have
presented
themselves
on
the
lower
tagus
in
face
of
lisbon
shortly
after
the
arrival
of
la
romana
in
the
portuguese
capital
the
emperor
to
berthier
september
no
of
the
de
not
in
the
but
in
the
form
of
a
letter
from
berthier
to
soult
which
soult
answers
at
great
length
in
his
dispatch
from
seville
of
december
le
corps
au
lieu
de
suivre
la
romana
et
par
là
de
menacer
la

pour
empêcher
les
anglais
d
avoir
toutes
leurs
forces
sur
la
rive
droite
s
est
replié
honteusement
sur
no
soult
had
little
difficulty
in
proving
that
this
scheme
was
absolutely
impossible
it
argued
indeed
a
complete
misconception
of
the
situation
in
estremadura
and
andalusia
to
talk
lightly
of
pushing
mortier
and
the
corps
which
comprised
at
this
moment
just
men
right
across
estremadura
to
the
mouth
of
the
tagus
en
talonnant
la
romana
was
futile
the
spanish
general
had
gone
off
to
join
wellington
with
some
or
men
but
he
had
left
behind
him
in
estremadura
two
strong
infantry
divisions
those
of
mendizabal
and
ballasteros
with
bayonets
more
infantry
in
garrison
at
badajoz
olivenza
and
albuquerque
and
the
whole
of
his
cavalry
sabres
in
addition
there
were
interposed
between
mortier
and
the
tagus
about
portuguese
a
cavalry
brigade
under
madden
which
had
been
lent
to
the
spaniards
and
near
badajoz
a
regular
infantry
brigade
at
elvas
and
four
militia
regiments
forming
the
garrisons
of
the
place
of
campo
mayor
and
of
jerumenha
that
is
to
say
there
lay
before
mortier
after
la
romana
s
departure
a
field
army
which
if
concentrated
would
make
up
men
and
in
addition
six
fortresses
containing
garrisons
amounting
to
men
more
and
covering
all
the
main
strategical
points
of
the
country
how
could
he
have
pursued
la
romana
if
he
had
followed
he
would
have
found
himself
at
once
involved
in
a
campaign
against
superior
forces
in
a
region
studded
with
hostile
strongholds
on
this
frontier
as
soult
wrote
to
berthier
there
are
six
fortified
places
badajoz
olivenza
jerumenha
elvas
campo
mayor
albuquerque
in
which
there
are
at
least
infantry
and
cavalry
it
is
clear
to
me
that
if
i
thrust
a
body
of
men
forward
to
the
tagus
as
his
majesty
has
directed
that
body
would
never
reach
its
destination
and
would
be
cut
off
and
surrounded
before
i
could
get
up
to
its
aid
this
was
indisputably
correct
mortier
might
have
beaten
mendizabal
and
ballasteros
in
the
open
field
if
they
chose
to
offer
him
battle
but
if
they
preferred
to
concentrate
on
badajoz
or
elvas
and
defied
him
from
under
the
shadow
of
those
great
fortresses
he
could
not
ignore
them
and
march
by
in
pursuit
of
la
romana
the
moment
that
he
was
past
their
positions
they
would
cut
him
off
from
andalusia
and
he
would
find
himself
with
their
whole
force
at
his
back
and
in
front
of
him
anything
that
wellington
might
have
sent
to
the
south
bank
of
the
tagus
in
december
this
would
have
meant
men
under
hill
at
the
new
year
about
under
beresford
as
soult
truly
said
the
expedition
would
have
been
encompassed
and
probably
destroyed
long
before
masséna
heard
of
its
having
got
anywhere
near
him
nevertheless
the
of
the
army
of
portugal
was
told
to
expect
this
diversion
as
a
matter
of
certainty
in
the
dispatch
that
foy
took
back
to
him
dated
he
was
given
the
precise
statement
that
the
corps
was
to
be
looked
for
somewhere
in
the
direction
of
montalvão
and
villaflor
on
the
tagus
above
abrantes
at
no
distant
date
soult

no

to

the

that
it
would
be
useless
to
send
mortier
alone
with
or
men
to
make
an
impossible
dash
at
the
tagus
soult
made
another
proposal
he
would
undertake
not
a
mere
raid
but
the
capture
of
badajoz
the
conquest
of
estremadura
and
the
destruction
of
the
army
of
that
province
but
he
must
take
with
him
a
force
much
greater
than
the
mere
corps
the
enterprise
is
a
big
one
but
ought
to
succeed
at
least
it
will
produce
a
happy
diversion
in
favour
of
the
imperial
army
in
portugal
it
would
call
back
la
romana
from
lisbon
and
possibly
cause
wellington
to
detach
troops
in
his
aid
and
masséna
would
have
less
in
front
of
him
in
consequence
and
might
resume
the
offensive
soult
to
berthier
december
from
seville
there
was
of
course
another
course
possible
soult
might
have
marched
for
estremadura
not
with
the
men
of
the
corps
alone
nor
yet
with
the
men
whom
he
actually
took
thither
in
january
but
with
the
greater
part
of
the
french
army
of
andalusia
or
men
to
do
so
he
would
have
had
to
abandon
granada
malaga
and
jaen
on
the
one
side
and
his
hold
on
the
condado
de
niebla
and
the
west
upon
the
other
he
might
even
possibly
have
had
to
raise
the
siege
of
cadiz
though
this
is
not
quite
certain
many
months
after
in
the
end
of
march
when
all
chance
of
the
conquest
of
portugal
was
over
the
emperor
told
him
that
this
would
have
been
his
proper
course
and
read
him
an
lecture
on
the
advantages
that
might
have
followed
if
he
had
evacuated
of
his
viceroyalty
and
taken
an
imposing
force
to
sweep
across
the
alemtejo
and
assail
lisbon
from
the
southern
side
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
in
december
and
january
all
the
orders
that
were
sent
him
directed
him
to
move
no
more
than
a
small
corps
in
one
dispatch
the
emperor
calls
it
only
men
a
supreme
present
on
the
spot
might
have
seen
his
way
to
make
the
temporary
sacrifice
of
the
provinces
which
had
cost
so
many
men
to
conquer
and
to
hold
in
order
that
every
available
man
might
be
sent
against
lisbon
and
the
english
might
at
last
be
expelled
from
the
peninsula
but
soult
was
not
such
a
he
was
only
one
of
the
many
viceroys
whom
napoleon
preferred
to
a
single
omnipotent
lieutenant
was
it
likely
that
he
would
sacrifice
half
his
own
territory
when
no
order
to
do
so
lay
before
him
in
order
that
a
colleague
sent
on
a
separate
task
with
forces
no
less
than
his
own
might
have
every
possible
advantage
soult
is
often
blamed
for
not
having
seen
that
the
crushing
of
wellington
s
army
was
the
end
to
which
all
others
should
have
been
subordinated
and
that
it
would
have
been
cheap
in
the
end
to
surrender
half
or
of
andalusia
and
even
to
raise
the
siege
of
cadiz
in
order
to
secure
that
point
he
might
have
replied
that
his
master
was
no
less
blind
than
himself
dispatch
after
dispatch
had
ordered
him
to
send
a
trifling
detachment
towards
the
tagus
not
to
mass
every
available
man
and
march
on
lisbon
leaving
seville
and
the
cadiz
lines
exposed
to
all
manner
of
dangers
he
was
primarily
responsible
for
the
retention
of
the
andalusia
that
he
had
conquered
it
was
for
the
emperor
not
for
himself
to
order
the
evacuation
of
much
or
all
of
that
great
realm
the
emperor
gave
no
such
directions
from
september
to
january
his
whole
series
of
dispatches
spoke
of
nothing
more
than
the
movement
of
a
moderate
force
those
of
january
and
february
approved
of
the
course
which
soult
had
actually
chosen
and
took
it
for
granted
that
he
would
not
move
towards
the
tagus
till
he
should
have
captured
badajoz
it
was
not
till
march
when
he
began
to
see
that
all
his
arrangements
were
going
wrong
and
that
his
scheme
of
times
was
erroneous
that
the
emperor
began
suddenly
to
launch
out
into
criticisms
of
soult
and
to
complain
that
to
try
to
hold
every
point
at
a
moment
of
crisis
leads
to
possible
disaster
that
seville
badajoz
and
the
cadiz
lines
were
the
only
necessary
things
and
that
the
marshal
ought
to
have
men
or
more
with
him
at
badajoz
instead
of
the
men
whom
he
had
actually
taken
thither
if
so
why
had
the
orders
not
been
given
to
that
effect
early
in
december
when
napoleon
had
just
learnt
from
foy
the
state
and
position
of
the
army
of
portugal
which
had
so
long
been
hidden
from
him
behind
wellington
s
screen
of
ordenança
this
dispatch
of
march
nap
no
which
must
have
reached
soult
about
the
end
of
april
when
masséna
had
long
retired
to
spain
told
him
that
he
should
have
withdrawn
all
the
corps
from
granada
save
the
six
polish
battalions
and
have
drawn
in
godinot
s
brigade
from
cordova
have
abandoned
the
whole
eastern
half
of
andalusia
and
have
tried
to
hold
nothing
but
the
siege
lines
of
cadiz
and
the
city
of
seville
but
this
was
wisdom
after
the
in
december
napoleon
was
harping
upon
a
diversion
with
men
to
montalvão
and
villaflor
not
ordering
the
evacuation
of
the
greater

of

soult
was
extremely
lucky
to
get
it
so
early
no
napoleon

berthier

no
if
we
seek
deep
enough
we
find
the
cause
of
all
misdirections
in
the
fact
that
the
emperor
persisted
in
guiding
the
movements
of
all
his
army
from
paris
and
would
not
appoint
an
independent
of
all
the
spanish
armies
who
should
be
able
to
issue
orders
that
would
be
promptly
obeyed
by
every
separate
marshal
or
general
in
each
province
a
moment
s
reflection
shows
that
the
as
to
the
details
of
the
situation
in
the
peninsula
from
which
napoleon
had
to
construct
his
scheme
of
operations
always
came
to
him
a
month
late
and
when
he
had
issued
the
dispatch
which
dealt
with
the
situation
it
reached
its
destination
after
the
interval
of
another
month
and
had
long
ceased
to
have
any
bearing
on
the
actual
position
of
affairs
a
single
example
of
how
the
system
worked
may
suffice
masséna
started
foy
for
paris
with
his
great
report
on
the
state
of
the
army
of
portugal
on
october
foy
reached
paris
and
saw
the
emperor
on
november
and
the
succeeding
days
the
detailed
dispatches
to
masséna
and
soult
consequent
on
foy
s
report
were
not
sent
off
till
december
on
january
soult
acknowledges
the
receipt
of
the
dispatch
of
that
date
along
with
that
of
two
others
dated
november
and
december
all
of
which
arrived
together
because
the
guerrilleros
of
la
mancha
had
stopped
the
posts
between
madrid
and
seville
for
a
full
fortnight
after
the
new
year
of
what
value
to
soult
on
january
could
be
orders
based
on
the
condition
and
projects
of
masséna
on
october
the
data
at
the
base
of
the
orders
were
three
months
old
while
soult
had
been
already
for
more
than
a
month
engaged
on
a
campaign
undertaken
on
his
own
responsibility
without
any
knowledge
of
the
exact
requirements
of
masséna
or
of
the
intentions
of
the
emperor
soult
to
berthier
from
the
siege
lines
in
front
of
olivenza
dated
january
the
estremaduran
expedition
of
therefore
must
be
looked
upon
as
the
private
scheme
of
the
duke
of
dalmatia
undertaken
with
the
general
object
of
giving
assistance
to
masséna
because
the
last
orders
that
he
had
received
from
paris
those
of
october
telling
him
to
give
assistance
by
sending
mortier
to
the
tagus
were
impossible
of
execution
soult
had
two
leading
ideas
in
his
mind
when
he
planned
out
his
campaign
the
first
was
that
he
was
going
into
a
country
thickly
set
with
fortresses
the
second
was
that
when
once
the
skirts
of
the
sierra
morena
have
been
passed
estremadura
is
a
cavalry
country
a
land
of
heaths
and
of
unenclosed
of
vast
area
accordingly
he
intended
to
march
with
a
very
large
force
of
cavalry
and
with
a
heavy
at
seville
he
had
at
his
disposition
the
greatest
arsenal
of
spain
but
for
many
months
all
that
it
produced
had
been
going
forward
to
cadiz
no
less
than
pieces
had
been
sent
to
arm
the
vast
lines
in
front
of
the
blockaded
city
accordingly
it
took
some
time
to
get
ready
the
heavy
guns
and
to
manufacture
the
ammunition
required
for
such
a
big
business
as
the
siege
of
the
six
fortresses
small
and
great
into
whose
midst
he
was
about
to
thrust
himself
the
personnel
for
the
had
also
to
be
collected
requisitions
were
sent
both
to
victor
at
cadiz
and
to
sebastiani
at
granada
to
detach
and
send
into
seville
nearly
all
their
sappers
and
the
men
of
several
companies
of
artillery
they
were
also
to
send
to
the
expeditionary
force
many
regiments
of
cavalry
mortier
had
only
two
hussars
and
chasseurs
which
had
sufficed
when
he
was
engaged
in
the
heights
of
the
sierra
morena
but
were
insufficient
when
he
was
about
to
descend
into
the
plain
of
the
guadiana
accordingly
half
the
cavalry
of
victor
s
corps
was
called
up
four
regiments
dragoons
hussars
while
sebastiani
gave
up
one
chasseurs
to
these
was
added
an
experimental
spanish
cavalry
regiment
of
juramentados
recently
organized
at
seville
only
one
infantry
regiment
was
requisitioned
the
line
from
victor
s
division
the
putting
together
of
these
resources
gave
a
force
in
which
the
proportions
of
the
arms
were
very
peculiar
cavalry
artillery
and
sappers
to
only
infantry
the
last
all
save
the
regiment
drawn
from
mortier
s
corps
the
orders
for
the
concentration
of
the
troops
were
issued
early
in
december
but
owing
to
the
time
required
for
drawing
in
units
from
granada
and
cadiz
and
for
the
preparation
of
the
it
was
not
till
the
last
day
of
the
old
year
that
the
marshal
took
his
departure
from
seville
he
calls
it
la
détermination
que
j
avais
prise
sur
de
simples
avis
to
berthier
january
for
the
explanation
of
all
this
see
soult
to
berthier
already
quoted
from
seville
december
acknowledging
the
receipt
of
the
imperial
orders
of
october
the
collection
of
a
field
army
of
men
which
was
to
cut
itself
loose
from
andalusia
for
a
time
imposed
some
tiresome
problems
on
soult
since
he
had
resolved
not
to
evacuate
granada
or
malaga
on
the
one
hand
nor
the
posts
west
of
the
guadalquivir
on
the
other
and
since
he
was
drawing
off
the
corps
which
had
hitherto
provided
for
the
safety
of
seville
and
found
detachments
for
the
condado
de
niebla
he
had
to
make
provision
for
the
filling
of
the
gap
left
behind
him
hence
we
find
him
calling
upon
victor
to
spare
men
from
in
front
of
cadiz
a
demand
which
the
duke
of
belluno
took
very
ill
since
he
truly
declared
that
he
had
no
more
troops
in
the
corps
than
sufficed
to
man
the
lines
and
to
keep
posts
of
observation
in
his
rear
the
garrison
of
cadiz
was
always
increasing
and
included
a
strong
nucleus
of
british
troops
how
could
he
face
sorties
or
disembarkations
in
his
rear
if
he
was
cut
down
to
a
mere
men
in
place
of
the
on
which
he
had
hitherto
reckoned
nevertheless
he
was
forced
to
provide
a
detachment
to
hold
xeres
as
a
house
to
seville
and
to
send
out
a
cavalry
regiment
dragoons
and
one
battalion
west
of
the
guadalquivir
similarly
the
brigade
of
godinot
in
the
kingdom
of
cordova
was
required
to
find
a
skeleton
garrison
for
seville
which
was
raised
to
a
somewhat
higher
figure
in
appearance
by
the
doubtful
aid
of
some
juramentado
companies
of
spaniards
and
of
the
dépôts
and
convalescents
of
the
corps
the
great
city
with
a
turbulent
population
of
souls
which
formed
the
centre
of
his
viceroyalty
became
at
this
time
soult
s
weakest
point
he
left
it
so
inadequately
held
that
it
was
at
the
mercy
of
any
considerable
hostile
force
which
might
approach
it
and
such
a
force
was
ere
long
as
we
shall
see
to
make
its
appearance
godinot
had
also
to
look
after
the
insurgent
bands
of
the
central
sierra
morena
who
often
blocked
the
post
road
to
madrid
sebastiani
save
for
the
cavalry
and
artillery
borrowed
from
him
was
left
with
his
corps
intact
and
his
duty
was
unchanged
to
watch
the
spanish
army
of
murcia
and
to
suppress
the
guerrilleros
of
the
sierra
de
ronda
and
the
eastern
coast
an
unending
task
from
which
soult
thought
that
he
ought
not
to
be
distracted
napoleon
wise
after
the
event
wrote
in
march
that
soult
should
have
left
no
more
than
the
polish
division
of
the
corps
in
the
direction
of
granada
and
have
brought
the
remainder
of
it
to
strengthen
or
support
the
troops
at
seville
and
in
the
lines
before
cadiz
in
that
case
the
poles
would
certainly
have
had
to
move
westward
also
ere
long
since
there
were
but
of
them
and
all
eastern
andalusia
would
have
had
to
be
evacuated
but
this
idea
had
never
struck
soult
as
practicable
and
sebastiani
s
whole
corps
was
left
in
its
old
posts
in
the
kingdom
of
granada
belonging
to
that
division
of
the
army
of
the
centre
under
dessolles
which
soult
had
borrowed
for
the
conquest
of
andalusia
and
which
king
joseph
despite
of
many
demands
could
never
get
back
the
invasion
of
estremadura
was
carried
out
in
two
columns
of
about
equal
strength
which
used
the
two
main
passes
between
western
andalusia
and
the
valley
of
the
guadiana
the
right
column
under
took
the
route
by
guadalcanal
llerena
and
usagre
it
was
composed
of
his
own
regiments
of
dragoons
from
the
corps
and
of
girard
s
infantry
division
of
the
corps
which
latter
had
been
cantoned
in
llerena
since
the
autumn
and
was
now
picked
up
and
taken
forward
by
the
cavalry
the
left
column
which
was
accompanied
both
by
soult
and
by
mortier
was
composed
of
briche
s
light
cavalry
and
gazan
s
division
of
the
corps
it
had
to
escort
the
slowly
moving
of
guns
which
with
the
kilos
of
powder
belonging
to
it
was
drawn
by
draught
oxen
requisitioned
along
with
their
drivers
from
the
province
of
seville
this
column
took
the
route
ronquillo
sta
olalla
monasterio
which
if
less
steep
and
better
made
than
the
road
is
longer
and
passes
through
an
even
more
desolate
and
resourceless
country
it
was
intended
that
the
two
columns
should
join
at
los
santos
or
almendralejo
in
the
estremaduran
plain
and
lay
siege
at
once
to
badajoz
the
enemy
s
most
formidable
stronghold
its
fall
so
soult
hoped
would
lead
to
the
easy
conquest
of
the
minor
fortresses
but
the
two
columns
did
not
meet
with
equal
fortune
that
commanded
by
met
practically
no
resistance
in
its
first
stages
on
arriving
at
usagre
on
january
it
found
in
its
front
almost
the
whole
of
the
allied
cavalry
in
estremadura
butron
with
spaniards
madden
with
nearly
portuguese
but
this
was
merely
a
screen
thrown
out
to
cover
the
retreat
beyond
the
guadiana
of
mendizabal
and
the
division
of
spanish
infantry
which
had
been
cantoned
in
this
region
that
officer
had
been
ordered
by
his
chief
la
romana
to
break
the
bridge
of
merida
after
retiring
over
it
and
then
to
attempt
to
hold
the
line
of
the
guadiana
he
did
neither
precipitately
marching
on
merida
he
passed
through
it
in
great
haste
but
forgot
to
see
that
the
bridge
was
duly
destroyed
and
then
retired
along
the
north
bank
of
the
guadiana
to
badajoz
according
to
his
directions
did
not
cross
the
river
but
halted
near
almendralejo
to
wait
for
the
other
column
which
was
not
forthcoming
only
soult
himself
and
briche
s
light
cavalry
appeared
at
zafra
on
the
and
joined
on
the
of
january
gazan
s
infantry
and
the
were
far
away
and
unavailable
for
many
a
day
the
plans
of
the
left
invading
column
had
miscarried
for
when
its
head
reached
monasterio
at
the
summit
of
the
long
pass
its
tail
the
was
dragging
far
behind
in
the
desolate
stages
about
ronquillo
and
sta
olalla
it
had
met
with
tempestuous
rains
as
might
have
been
expected
at
the
season
many
of
the
oxen
died
the
unwilling
spanish
drivers
deserted
wholesale
and
there
was
much
delay
and
considerable
loss
of
vehicles
the
train
and
its
small
escort
got
completely
separated
from
gazan
s
infantry
at
this
moment
soult
s
cavalry
reported
to
him
that
a
formidable
column
of
hostile
infantry
was
lying
a
few
miles
to
the
west
of
monasterio
on
the
bad
to
calera
and
was
apparently
moving
round
his
flank
either
to
fall
upon
the
belated
convoy
or
perhaps
to
make
a
dash
at
seville
this
column
was
the
infantry
of
ballasteros
who
as
it
chanced
had
begun
to
march
southward
at
the
same
moment
that
soult
had
started
northward
the
spanish
general
had
just
received
orders
from
cadiz
bidding
him
cut
himself
loose
from
the
estremaduran
army
and
move
into
the
condado
de
niebla
where
he
was
to
unite
with
the
local
levies
under
copons
drive
out
the
weak
french
detachment
there
stationed
and
threaten
seville
from
the
west
if
it
should
be
practicable
these
orders
had
been
given
of
course
before
soult
s
plan
for
invading
estremadura
was
suspected
at
cadiz
but
though
unwise
in
themselves
it
was
not
the
time
to
deplete
estremadura
of
troops
they
had
the
effect
of
bringing
soult
s
great
manœuvre
to
a
standstill
for
some
weeks
the
marshal
determined
that
he
must
free
his
flank
from
this
threatening
force
before
continuing
his
march
and
ordered
mortier
to
attack
ballasteros
without
delay
this
was
done
but
the
spaniard
after
a
running
fight
of
two
hours
retired
to
fregenal
fifteen
miles
further
west
without
suffering
any
serious
harm
january
he
was
still
in
a
position
to
threaten
the
rear
of
the
convoy
or
to
slip
round
the
flank
of
the
french
column
towards
seville
soult
therefore
resolved
to
go
on
with
his
cavalry
and
join
but
to
drop
gazan
s
infantry
in
the
passes
with
the
order
to
head
off
ballasteros
at
all
costs
and
to
cover
the
in
its
journey
across
the
mountains
gazan
therefore
took
post
at
fuentes
de
leon
but
soon
heard
that
ballasteros
had
moved
south
again
from
fregenal
towards
the
chanza
river
and
was
apparently
trying
to
get
round
his
flank
leaving
a
detachment
to
help
the
convoy
on
its
slow
and
toilsome
route
gazan
resolved
to
pursue
the
spanish
column
and
destroy
it
at
all
costs
this
determination
led
him
into
three
weeks
of
desperate
and
at
the
worst
season
of
the
year
for
ballasteros
who
showed
considerable
skill
in
drawing
his
enemy
on
moved
ever
south
and
west
towards
the
lower
guadiana
and
picked
up
copons
s
levies
by
the
way
he
at
last
turned
to
fight
at
villanueva
de
los
castillejos
on
january
gazan
who
had
been
joined
meanwhile
by
the
small
french
detachment
in
the
condado
de
niebla
brought
his
enemy
to
action
on
the
the
asturian
battalions
which
formed
ballasteros
s
division
made
a
creditable
resistance
and
when
evicted
from
their
position
retired
across
the
guadiana
to
alcoutim
in
portugal
without
having
suffered
any
overwhelming
loss
gazan
therefore
resolved
to
pursue
them
no
further
indeed
he
had
been
drawn
down
into
one
of
the
remotest
corners
of
spain
to
little
profit
and
realized
that
soult
must
be
brought
to
a
standstill
one
hundred
miles
away
for
want
of
the
infantry
who
had
now
been
executing
their
toilsome
excursion
in
the
mountains
for
three
weeks
certainly
not
with
the
loss
of
men
as
gazan
alleged
still
less
with
that
of
as
stated
by
napier
accordingly
the
french
general
bade
remond
the
commander
of
the
niebla
detachment
watch
ballasteros
and
himself
returned
to
estremadura
by
a
most
painful
march
through
puebla
de
guzman
el
cerro
fregenal
and
xeres
de
los
caballeros
he
reported
his
return
to
soult
at
valverde
on
february
his
services
had
been
lost
to
his
chief
for
a
month
all
but
two
days
a
fact
which
had
the
gravest
results
on
the
general
course
of
the
campaign
of
estremadura
by
far
the
best
account
of
this
wild
excursion
is
to
be
found
in
la
mare
s
account
of
the
estremaduran
campaign
of
paris
toreno
exaggerates
the
losses
of
the
french
which
can
not
have
been
heavy
as
martinien
s
des
officiers
shows
only
two
or
three
casualties
in
gazan
s
division
for
the
duke
of
dalmatia
when
he
had
joined
on
january
found
that
he
had
at
his
disposition
cavalry
but
only
the
infantry
of
girard
while
the
was
still
blocked
in
the
passes
by
monasterio
with
such
a
force
he
did
not
like
to
beleaguer
a
place
so
large
and
so
heavily
garrisoned
as
badajoz
accordingly
he
was
forced
to
abandon
his
original
intention
of
forming
its
siege
and
to
think
of
some
lesser
enterprise
more
suited
to
his
strength
after
some
hesitation
he
determined
to
attack
the
weak
and
fortress
of
olivenza
the
southernmost
of
all
the
fortified
places
on
the
frontier
to
cover
his
movement
he
sent
briche
s
cavalry
to
merida
which
they
occupied
on
january
almost
without
resistance
finding
the
bridge
intact
from
thence
they
sought
for
mendizabal
on
the
north
side
of
the
guadiana
and
discovered
that
he
had
withdrawn
to
albuquerque
twenty
miles
north
of
badajoz
meanwhile
with
four
dragoon
regiments
took
post
at
albuera
to
watch
the
garrison
of
badajoz
while
soult
marched
with
girard
s
infantry
and
one
cavalry
regiment
to
attack
olivenza
before
whose
walls
he
appeared
on
january
olivenza
ought
never
to
have
been
defended
for
since
its
cession
by
portugal
to
spain
after
godoy
s
futile
war
of
the
oranges
in
it
had
been
systematically
neglected
the
breach
made
by
the
spaniards
at
its
siege
ten
years
before
had
never
been
properly
repaired
only
of
the
masonry
had
been
replaced
and
the
rest
of
the
gap
had
been
merely
stopped
with
earth
its
one
outlying
work
a
lunette
yards
only
from
its
southern
point
was
lying
in
ruins
and
unoccupied
the
circuit
of
its
walls
was
about
a
mile
but
there
were
only
eighteen
guns
to
guard
them
the
garrison
down
to
the
of
january
had
consisted
of
a
single
battalion
left
there
by
la
romana
when
he
marched
for
portugal
in
october
but
mendizabal
apparently
in
inexcusable
ignorance
of
the
condition
of
the
place
had
ordered
a
whole
brigade
of
his
infantry
to
throw
themselves
into
it
when
soult
began
to
press
forward
he
sacrificed
in
fact
out
of
the
bayonets
of
his
division
by
bidding
them
shut
themselves
up
in
an
utterly
untenable
fortress
the
governor
general
manuel
herck
an
old
swiss
officer
was
ailing
and
quite
incapable
a
man
of
resources
might
have
done
something
with
the
heavy
garrison
placed
under
his
orders
even
though
the
walls
were
weak
and
artillery
almost
but
herck
disgraced
himself
soult
reports
eighteen
guns
surrendered
but
herck
says
in
his
dispatch
that
only
eight
were
serviceable
the
original
garrison
was
voluntarios
de
navarra
bayonets
properly
belonging
to
o
donnell
s
division
which
was
at
lisbon
with
la
romana
the
reinforcements
thrown
in
at
the
last
moment
were
four
battalions
bayonets
from
the
regiments
merida
truxillo
barbastro
and
monforte
the
two
former
part
of
the
original
army
of
estremadura
the
two
latter
part
of
del
parque
s
old
army
from
the
north
when
soult
arrived
in
front
of
olivenza
on
january
his
engineers
informed
him
that
the
place
weak
as
it
was
was
too
strong
to
take
by
escalade
but
that
a
very
few
days
of
regular
battering
would
suffice
to
ruin
it
unfortunately
for
him
there
was
as
yet
no
heavy
artillery
at
his
disposition
but
only
the
divisional
batteries
of
girard
s
two
brigades
the
was
still
stuck
in
the
passes
however
the
outlying
lunette
opposite
the
south
front
was
at
once
seized
and
turned
into
a
battery
for
four
which
opened
their
fire
on
the
next
day
the
old
spanish
breach
of
obviously
ready
to
fall
in
on
account
of
its
rickety
repairs
was
visible
in
the
front
the
bastion
of
san
pedro
opposite
this
sites
for
two
more
batteries
were
planned
and
a
first
parallel
opened
the
went
on
almost
unhindered
by
the
spaniards
who
showed
but
few
guns
and
shot
very
badly
but
under
considerable
difficulties
from
the
rainy
weather
which
was
perpetually
flooding
the
lower
parts
of
the
lines
but
in
ten
days
approaches
were
pushed
right
up
to
the
edge
of
the
counterscarp
and
mines
prepared
to
blow
it
in
the
siege
artillery
began
to
arrive
on
the
in
detachments
and
continued
to
drop
in
for
several
days
on
the
the
batteries
being
completed
were
armed
with
the
first
that
came
up
on
the
the
fire
began
and
at
once
proved
most
effective
the
bastion
of
san
pedro
began
to
crumble
in
and
the
old
breach
of
revealed
itself
by
the
falling
away
of
the
rammed
earth
which
alone
stopped
it
up
the
arrangements
for
a
storm
had
not
yet
been
commenced
when
the
garrison
hoisted
the
white
flag
mortier
refused
all
negotiations
and
demanded
a
surrender
at
discretion
this
the
old
governor
hastened
to
concede
coming
out
in
person
at
one
of
the
gates
and
putting
the
place
at
the
disposition
of
the
french
without
further
argument
soult
and
mortier
entered
next
day
and
spanish
troops
marched
out
and
laid
down
their
arms
before
the
infantry
of
girard
who
had
formed
the
sole
besieging
force
the
total
loss
of
the
french
during
the
siege
was
killed
and
wounded
that
of
the
besieged
about
the
figures
are
a
sufficient
evidence
of
the
disgraceful
weakness
of
the
defence
herck
s
miserable
exculpatory
dispatch
may
be
found
in
chaby
iv
pp
when
one
reflects
what
was
done
to
hold
the
unfortified
town
of
saragossa
and
the
mediaeval
enceinte
of
gerona
it
is
impossible
not
to
reflect
what
a
determined
governor
might
have
accomplished
at
olivenza
the
place
was
short
of
guns
no
doubt
but
the
enemy
was
worse
off
till
the
last
days
of
the
siege
since
he
had
nothing
but
twelve
light
until
the
began
to
arrive
general
herck
made
no
sorties
to
disturb
the
works
though
he
had
a
superabundant
garrison
he
made
no
serious
attempt
to
retrench
the
breach
and
he
surrendered
actually
ere
the
first
summons
had
been
sent
in
before
the
storm
at
the
worst
he
might
have
tried
to
cut
his
way
out
between
the
french
camps
which
were
scattered
far
from
each
other
owing
to
the
extremely
small
numbers
of
the
besieging
army
who
only
counted
three
men
to
the
defenders
two
altogether
it
was
a
disgraceful
business
the
place
no
doubt
ought
never
to
have
been
held
but
if
held
it
might
at
least
have
been
defended
which
it
practically
was
not
soult
was
placed
in
a
new
difficulty
by
the
surrender
of
olivenza
though
his
had
begun
to
come
up
he
had
no
news
of
gazan
and
his
infantry
was
still
no
more
than
a
single
division
he
had
to
spare
two
battalions
to
escort
the
prisoners
to
seville
and
to
put
another
in
olivenza
as
garrison
this
left
him
only
eleven
battalions
bayonets
to
continue
the
campaign
though
he
had
the
enormous
force
of
cavalry
at
his
disposition
and
a
that
was
growing
every
day
as
more
belated
pieces
came
up
from
the
rear
he
might
probably
have
waited
for
gazan
for
whom
messages
had
been
vainly
sent
if
he
had
not
received
on
the
day
that
olivenza
fell
one
more
of
berthier
s
peremptory
letters
dated
december
in
which
he
was
told
as
usual
to
send
the
corps
to
join
masséna
on
the
tagus
without
delay
this
letter
came
at
an
even
more
inappropriate
moment
than
usual
as
gazan
with
half
that
corps
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
mountain
of
the
condado
de
niebla
more
than
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
away
but
it
was
clear
that
something
immediate
must
be
done
or
the
emperor
would
be
more
discontented
than
before
accordingly
soult
resolved
to
take
the
very
hazardous
step
of
laying
siege
to
badajoz
at
once
with
the
small
infantry
force
at
his
disposition
for
this
move
would
undoubtedly
provoke
alarm
at
lisbon
and
lead
wellington
to
send
off
la
romana
s
army
to
succour
it
and
perhaps
some
troops
also
so
that
the
mass
opposed
to
masséna
would
be
more
or
less
weakened
the
regiment
sent
back
with
the
prisoners
was
the
the
one
borrowed
from
victor
it
had
not
been
at
the
siege
but
supporting
at
albuera
the
garrison
left
in
olivenza
was
one
battalion
of
the
accordingly
on
the
of
january
soult
marched
against
badajoz
which
is
only
twelve
miles
of
olivenza
with
under
infantry
ten
companies
of
artillery
and
seven
of
sappers
to
invest
the
southern
side
of
badajoz
while
with
six
regiments
of
cavalry
crossed
the
guadiana
by
a
ford
and
went
to
blockade
the
place
on
its
northern
front
badajoz
though
owning
some
defects
was
still
a
stronghold
of
the
first
class
in
far
better
order
than
most
of
the
peninsular
fortresses
it
belonged
to
that
order
of
places
whose
topography
forces
a
besieger
to
divide
his
army
by
a
dangerous
obstacle
since
it
lies
on
a
broad
river
with
the
town
on
one
side
and
a
formidable
outwork
on
the
other
indeed
the
most
striking
feature
of
badajoz
whether
the
traveller
approaches
it
from
the
east
or
the
west
is
the
towering
height
of
san
cristobal
crowned
by
its
fort
lying
above
the
transpontine
suburb
and
dominating
the
whole
city
any
enemy
who
begins
operations
against
the
place
must
take
measures
to
blockade
or
to
attack
this
fort
which
completely
covers
the
bridge
and
its
and
effectively
protects
ingress
or
egress
to
or
from
the
place
but
san
cristobal
is
not
easy
to
blockade
since
it
is
the
of
a
very
steep
narrow
range
of
hills
which
run
for
many
miles
to
the
north
and
divide
the
beyond
the
guadiana
into
two
separate
valleys
those
of
the
gebora
and
the
caya
which
are
completely
invisible
from
each
other
the
city
of
badajoz
is
built
on
an
inclined
plane
sloping
down
from
the
castle
which
stands
on
a
lofty
hill
with
almost
precipitous
grass
slopes
at
the
end
of
the
place
down
to
the
river
on
the
north
and
the
plain
on
the
south
and
west
the
and
san
cristobal
between
them
form
a
sort
of
gorge
through
which
the
guadiana
narrowed
for
a
space
forces
its
way
to
broaden
out
again
at
the
immensely
long
bridge
with
its
arches
and
yards
of
roadway
below
the
castle
the
rivillas
a
stagnant
brook
with
hardly
any
current
the
home
of
frogs
and
the
of
the
city
storks
coasts
around
the
walls
and
finally
dribbles
into
the
river
the
front
of
the
place
from
the
river
to
the
castle
was
composed
of
eight
regular
bastions
along
the
river
edge
there
lies
nothing
more
than
a
single
solid
wall
without
relief
or
indentations
but
this
side
of
the
place
is
wholly
inaccessible
owing
to
the
water
there
are
two
outlying
works
which
cover
heights
so
close
into
the
place
that
it
is
necessary
to
hold
them
lest
the
enemy
should
establish
himself
too
near
the
enceinte
these
are
the
picurina
lunette
beyond
the
rivillas
and
the
much
larger
pardaleras
fort
a
opposite
the
south
point
of
the
city
which
covers
a
hill
that
commands
that
part
of
the
place
and
is
a
position
impossible
to
concede
to
the
besieger
since
it
is
only
yards
from
the
nearest
bastion
it
was
having
a
very
shallow
ditch
and
being
incompletely
closed
at
its
gorge
by
a
mere
palisade
the
eight
bastions
which
form
the
attackable
part
of
the
enceinte
of
badajoz
have
they
remain
just
as
they
were
in
for
the
place
has
never
been
modernized
a
height
of
about
thirty
feet
from
the
bottom
of
the
ditch
to
the
rampart
while
the
curtains
between
them
are
somewhat
lower
about
feet
only
the
ditch
was
broad
with
a
good
counterscarp
in
masonry
seven
feet
high
beyond
it
each
bastion
was
protected
in
front
by
a
rather
low
and
weak
except
the
two
nearest
the
river
san
vincente
and
san
josé
which
are
a
little
lower
the
garrison
not
more
than
enough
for
such
an
extensive
place
consisted
at
the
new
year
of
men
but
mendizabal
threw
in
two
battalions
more
and
of
the
second
regiment
of
seville
before
he
retired
to
the
borders
of
portugal
so
that
the
figure
had
risen
to
before
soult
appeared
in
front
of
the
walls
the
governor
was
a
very
distinguished
soldier
general
rafael
menacho
who
had
served
through
the
old
french
war
of
and
had
commanded
a
regiment
at
baylen
he
was
in
the
full
vigour
of
middle
age
years
old
and
abounding
in
spirit
resolution
and
initiative
as
all
his
movements
showed
down
to
the
unhappy
day
of
his
death
soult
s
engineers
after
surveying
the
situation
of
badajoz
reported
that
under
ordinary
circumstances
the
most
profitable
front
to
attack
would
certainly
be
the
western
that
between
the
pardaleras
fort
and
the
river
but
at
the
same
time
they
decided
that
it
had
better
be
left
alone
for
the
army
was
so
weak
that
it
could
not
properly
invest
the
whole
city
and
if
the
north
bank
of
the
guadiana
were
left
practically
unoccupied
as
must
necessarily
be
the
case
the
spaniards
would
be
able
to
seize
the
ground
beyond
the
and
establish
batteries
there
which
would
effectually
enfilade
the
trenches
which
would
have
to
be
constructed
for
approaching
the
west
side
of
the
place
the
castle
and
the
angle
of
the
town
were
too
to
be
chosen
as
the
point
of
attack
and
the
rivillas
and
its
boggy
banks
were
better
avoided
they
therefore
advised
that
the
south
front
should
be
chosen
as
the
objective
and
that
the
first
operation
taken
in
hand
should
be
the
capture
of
the
pardaleras
fort
for
that
work
appeared
weak
and
while
its
site
would
make
the
most
advantageous
of
for
breaching
the
enceinte
of
the
town
itself
it
was
the
most
commanding
ground
close
in
to
the
walls
which
could
be
discovered
soult
and
mortier
concurred
and
placed
the
army
in
the
best
position
for
utilizing
this
method
of
attack
the
camps
of
girard
s
division
were
placed
on
and
around
two
low
hills
the
cerro
de
san
miguel
on
the
right
of
the
rivillas
and
the
cerro
del
viento
on
its
left
on
the
former
height
about
yards
from
the
town
nothing
was
done
save
the
construction
of
a
rough
entrenchment
to
face
the
picurina
and
restrict
possible
sallies
in
which
three
small
batteries
were
afterwards
inserted
the
cerro
del
viento
which
is
about
yards
from
the
pardaleras
was
to
be
the
real
of
the
attack
and
under
its
side
the
and
engineers
camp
were
established
two
batteries
in
front
of
it
were
marked
out
and
begun
on
the
first
night
of
open
trenches
january
but
it
was
not
till
the
third
night
january
that
the
first
parallel
was
commenced
on
the
undulating
ground
to
the
west
of
the
rivillas
when
the
work
became
visible
next
day
the
governor
directed
a
vigorous
sortie
against
it
composed
of
men
the
trenches
were
occupied
for
a
moment
but
soon
recovered
by
the
french
supports
a
small
body
of
spanish
cavalry
which
had
taken
part
in
the
sally
rode
right
round
the
rear
of
the
camp
and
sabred
the
cazin
the
chief
engineer
and
a
dozen
of
his
sappers
on
the
cerro
del
viento
but
the
total
loss
of
the
besiegers
was
only
about
seventy
killed
and
wounded
while
the
men
of
the
sortie
suffered
much
more
heavily
while
they
were
being
driven
back
across
the
open
ground
towards
the
city
their
commander
a
colonel
bassecourt
of
the
regiment
of
seville
the
corps
which
furnished
the
sallying
force
was
killed
next
day
the
were
so
little
injured
that
the
artillery
was
able
to
put
guns
into
the
first
batteries
that
had
been
marked
out
on
the
first
three
days
of
february
incessant
and
torrential
rains
stopped
further
work
the
whole
of
the
first
parallel
was
inundated
and
the
flying
bridge
by
which
alone
soult
could
communicate
with
on
the
other
side
of
the
guadiana
was
washed
away
but
despite
of
the
rain
february
was
a
day
of
joy
for
the
french
for
on
its
morning
gazan
reported
his
arrival
at
valverde
ten
miles
away
and
at
o
clock
his
division
of
men
marched
into
camp
and
doubled
the
force
of
the
besieging
army
their
arrival
was
a
piece
of
cruel
for
the
spaniards
for
on
that
same
afternoon
at
dusk
menacho
sent
out
a
formidable
sortie
of
men
all
that
he
could
safely
spare
from
the
ramparts
who
came
out
of
the
gate
puerto
de
las
palmas
and
stormed
the
first
parallel
driving
out
the
workers
and
the
three
companies
of
their
covering
party
the
spaniards
had
already
filled
up
a
considerable
section
of
the
trench
when
they
were
charged
by
two
battalions
of
gazan
s
troops
and
driven
out
again
before
they
had
finished
their
task
the
serious
nature
of
the
attack
may
be
judged
from
the
fact
that
the
french
lost
killed
and
wounded
including
eight
officers
in
repelling
it
if
only
one
brigade
of
girard
had
been
in
the
cerro
del
viento
camps
instead
of
gazan
s
entire
division
it
is
probable
that
the
whole
first
parallel
and
the
batteries
behind
it
would
have
been
destroyed
while
the
damage
was
being
repaired
on
february
soult
began
to
bombard
the
town
from
these
batteries
but
with
no
good
effect
the
result
indeed
was
rather
to
the
profit
of
the
spaniards
for
a
great
portion
of
the
civil
population
fled
at
the
first
sign
of
bombardment
and
escaped
by
night
down
the
guadiana
bank
towards
elvas
the
provisions
left
in
their
deserted
houses
added
appreciably
to
menacho
s
stores
the
work
of
extending
the
first
parallel
diagonally
toward
the
pardaleras
was
still
going
on
when
on
february
the
whole
situation
before
badajoz
was
changed
by
the
appearance
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
spanish
army
of
succour
even
before
soult
had
started
from
seville
at
the
new
year
wellington
had
been
aware
of
the
imminence
of
the
invasion
of
estremadura
and
had
been
consulting
with
his
colleague
la
romana
as
to
the
measures
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
take
as
early
as
the
of
january
la
romana
had
sent
orders
to
mendizabal
to
tell
him
that
if
the
french
should
cross
the
sierra
morena
in
force
he
was
to
evacuate
southern
estremadura
break
the
bridges
of
medellin
and
merida
and
endeavour
to
defend
the
line
of
the
guadiana
by
later
instructions
january
mendizabal
was
directed
to
retire
into
the
sierra
de
san
mamed
if
the
enemy
crossed
the
river
above
badajoz
but
to
throw
himself
upon
their
rear
and
to
hang
on
to
them
if
they
crossed
below
and
seemed
to
be
making
for
elvas
and
portugal
on
the
wellington
hearing
that
soult
seemed
to
be
heading
towards
olivenza
rather
than
merida
conceived
doubts
as
to
whether
he
might
not
be
intending
to
abandon
his
communications
with
seville
to
leave
the
fortresses
behind
him
and
to
march
to
the
tagus
to
with
masséna
upon
the
alemtejo
bank
of
that
river
on
the
arrived
the
more
comfortable
news
that
the
french
had
sat
down
to
beleaguer
olivenza
a
sure
sign
that
they
did
not
propose
to
cut
themselves
loose
from
their
base
and
to
join
masséna
as
a
flying
column
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
we
have
seen
soult
having
been
deprived
of
gazan
s
assistance
was
too
weak
at
this
moment
to
dream
of
an
incursion
into
portugal
and
had
attacked
olivenza
because
he
could
find
nothing
else
to
do
for
the
present
wellington

under

leadership
would
probably
have
achieved
its
desired
end
and
have
held
soult
completely
in
check
but
he
was
prevented
from
starting
with
his
troops
on
the
by
an
indisposition
which
was
not
judged
to
be
serious
a
spasm
in
the
chest
apparently
a
preliminary
attack
of
he
appeared
convalescent
on
the
but
died
suddenly
of
a
recurrence
of
the
complaint
early
on
the
afternoon
of
the
after
he
had
already
sent
forward
his
secretary
and
staff
to
prepare
quarters
for
him
on
the
way
towards
the
army
his
death
was
a
real
disaster
to
the
cause
of
the
allies
for
two
main
reasons
the
first
was
that
unlike
most
of
his
contemporaries
in
the
spanish
service
he
was
a
very
cautious
general
who
avoided
risks
and
preferred
to
manœuvre
rather
than
to
fight
unless
he
had
a
good
chance
of
success
his
long
marches
and
many
retreats
had
won
him
the
punning
nickname
of
the
marqués
de
las
romerías
the
marquis
of
pilgrimages
but
even
a
long
pilgrimage
is
better
than
a
defeat
and
he
had
never
destroyed
an
army
like
cuesta
blake
or
areizaga
the
other
reason
which
made
him
valuable
to
the
allied
cause
was
that
being
a
man
of
great
tact
and
obliging
manners
he
had
won
wellington
s
personal
regard
and
always
lived
on
the
best
terms
with
him
indeed
the
marquis
was
the
only
spanish
general
save
castaños
who
never
had
any
difficulties
with
his
english
colleague
and
it
may
be
added
that
wellington
thought
much
more
of
his
capacity
than
of
that
of
castaños
whom
he
regarded
as
but
weak
he
wrote
of
him
in
words
that
may
be
regarded
as
entirely
genuine
and
heartfelt
and
which
were
not
intended
for
spanish
eyes
that
he
was
the
brightest
ornament
of
the
spanish
army
an
upright
patriot
a
strenuous
and
zealous
defender
of
the
cause
of
european
liberty
a
loyal
colleague
a
useful
councillor
wellington
calls
the
disease
spasms
of
the
chest
the
spanish
authorities
term
it
an
aneurism
see
especially
wellington
to
liverpool
january
in
vii
the
corresponding
letter
to
mendizabal
is
less
important
because
it
is
written
to
a
spanish
correspondent
that
the
marquis
was
not
a
man
of
brilliant
genius
nor
a
general
of
the
first
rank
is
sufficiently
evident
from
the
account
of
his
campaigns
duly
detailed
in
the
first
three
volumes
of
this
work
but
he
had
a
very
high
and
meritorious
record
of
all
the
old
nobles
of
spain
he
was
the
one
who
served
his
country
best
in
the
day
of
her
distress
his
energy
and
determination
were
displayed
in
his
romantic
escape
from
denmark
in
having
once
unsheathed
his
sword
in
the
national
cause
he
never
faltered
or
despaired
even
in
the
day
of
the
worst
disaster
if
his
life
had
been
spared
he
would
have
fought
on
undismayed
to
the
end
of
the
war
though
he
became
involved
in
the
unhappy
disputes
which
preceded
the
fall
of
the
supreme
junta
in
the
winter
of
and
did
not
disdain
to
accept
a
command
from
the
illegal
seville
government
in
the
january
of
the
latter
year
he
was
neither
a
nor
a
if
his
words
or
acts
sometimes
appeared
factious
they
were
inspired
by
a
genuine
discontent
at
the
incapacity
of
the
ruling
powers
not
by
a
desire
for
and
there
seems
to
be
no
evidence
to
connect
him
with
the
unwise
and
autocratic
proceedings
of
his
brother
josé
caro
in
valencia
during
the
last
year
of
his
life
he
was
discharging
a
very
invidious
task
while
he
commanded
in
estremadura
under
the
control
of
the
last
regency
which
treated
him
with
neglect
and
regarded
him
with
suspicion
his
death
is
said
to
have
been
hastened
by
scurrilous
accusations
made
against
his
loyalty
in
pamphlets
and
newspapers
published
at
cadiz
which
drove
him
to
distraction
for
he
was
a
man
of
a
sensitive
disposition
keenly
affected
by
any
criticism

in

hear
that

destroyed

behind

meanwhile
mendizabal
made

of

fell
to
another
officer
new

josé

la

became
chief
of
the
staff
or
practically
second
in
command
and
his
vanguard
division
passed
to
his
old
brigadier
carlos
de
españa
as
early
as
january
soult
had
directed
with
four
regiments
of
light
cavalry
to
make
a
reconnaissance
in
the
direction
of
the
portuguese
frontier
and
by
this
movement
had
become
aware
that
mendizabal
was
at
portalegre
with
his
own
infantry
and
butron
s
cavalry
it
was
no
surprise
to
the
marshal
therefore
to
find
a
week
later
that
a
considerable
force
was
pressing
in
his
posts
on
the
north
of
the
guadiana
the
presence
of
madden
s
portuguese
dragoons
in
the
advanced
guard
showed
that
the
enemy
had
been
reinforced
s
was
driven
in
without
much
fighting
and
the
french
general
retired
to
montijo
nine
miles
up
the
river
february
that
night
mendizabal
s
army
nearly
strong
camped
on
the
heights
of
san
cristobal
and
communicated
with
badajoz
freely
the
blockade
being
broken
so
far
as
the
northern
bank
of
the
guadiana
was
concerned
wellington
and
la
romana
when
the
return
of
the
spanish
troops
from
lisbon
to
estremadura
was
ordered
had
settled
upon
a
regular
plan
of
campaign
which
had
been
communicated
to
mendizabal
it
required
some
slight
modification
when
the
fall
of
olivenza
became
known
and
when
soult
s
intention
to
besiege
badajoz
declared
itself
but
in
its
essentials
it
was
well
applicable
to
the
situation
of
affairs
upon
february
after
a
solemn
warning
to
the
spanish
generals
that
the
army
of
estremadura
is
the
last
body
of
troops
which
their
country
possesses
and
must
not
be
risked
in
dangerous
operations
the
memorandum
suggests
that
an
entrenched
camp
capable
of
holding
the
entire
army
should
be
prepared
on
the
heights
which
lie
between
campo
mayor
and
badajoz
and
which
end
in
the
high
bluff
of
san
cristobal
above
the
latter
town
that
if
possible
an
attempt
should
be
made
to
break
the
bridges
of
medellin
and
merida
so
as
to
restrict
the
french
to
the
southern
bank
of
the
guadiana
that
the
regency
should
be
asked
to
send
back
ballasteros
s
division
to
join
the
army
of
estremadura
and
that
the
bridge
of
boats
in
store
at
badajoz
should
if
possible
be
floated
down
to
jerumenha
to
give
the
portuguese
garrison
of
elvas
the
power
of
crossing
the
guadiana
below
badajoz
the
last
suggestion
was
impracticable
because
the
french
when
the
dispatch
reached
mendizabal
were
so
close
to
the

that
the

not

the
other
three
suggestions
were
all
valuable
but
none
of

were
carried
out

of
all
the
most
important
of

that
which
prescribed
the
entrenching
of
the
san
cristobal
heights
and
their
occupation
by
the
whole
of
the
spanish
army
this
is
memorandum
to
the
marquis
of
la
romana
to
be
found
in
wellington
vii
with
date
january
three
days
before
that
of
the
death
of
the
marquis
mendizabal
had
a
plan
of
his
own
he
resolved
not
to
fortify
himself
on
the
heights
beyond
the
river
as
wellington
suggested
but
to
throw
a
great
part
of
his
infantry
into
badajoz
and
make
with
them
a
grand
sortie
against
the
french
lines
the
bulk
of
his
cavalry
remained
below
san
cristobal
and
had
a
skirmish
of
evil
omen
with
who
drove
them
in
with
ease
and
pursued
them
beyond
the
gebora
to
the
foot
of
the
heights
but
madden
s
portuguese
horse
filed
into
town
across
the
bridge
to
join
in
the
sally
of
the
infantry
at
three
o
clock
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
february
the
sortie
was
made
while
madden
s
dragoons
and
a
small
infantry
support
threatened
the
left
of
the
french
lines
without
closing
a
large
force
composed
of
all
carlos
de
españa
s
vanguard
division
with
picked
battalions
from
the
others
delivered
a
vigorous
indeed
a
desperate
assault
upon
soult
s
right
the
entrenchments
on
the
hill
of
san
miguel
there
were
apparently
four
columns
each
of
two
battalions
and
making
men
they
came
out
from
the
trinidad
gate
drew
up
under
the
wing
of
the
picurina
lunette
and
then
marched
straight
at
the
french
camp
they
pierced
the
line
of
entrenchments
in
their
first
rush
swept
away
the
guard
of
the
trenches
carried
the
three
batteries
which
were
inserted
in
them
and
then
became
engaged
in
a
fierce
fight
with
phillipon
s
brigade
of
girard
s
division
the
troops
encamped
behind
this
part
of
the
lines
mortier
who
was
on
the
other
flank
detecting
that
the
movements
in
front
of
him
were
only
a
demonstration
promptly
sent
several
battalions
eastward
to
succour
the
threatened
point
these
fell
upon
the
spaniards
flank
and
threatened
to
cut
them
off
from
their
retreat
into
the
fortress
whereupon
carlos
de
españa
who
was
slightly
wounded
ordered
a
retreat
finding
that
forces
equal
to
his
own
had
now
been
concentrated
against
him
his
troops
suffered
severely
in
fighting
their
way
back
into
badajoz
their
loss
was
about
men
that
of
the
french
whose
front
line
had
been
very
severely
handled
came
to
about
but
the
besieged
could
spare
the
larger
number
better
than
the
besiegers
the
smaller
since
they
had
the
whole
army
of
succour
to
draw
upon
while
soult
had
no
reserves
nearer
than
seville
it
is
hard
to
see
why
mendizabal
if
he
was
resolved
upon
a
sortie
did
not
double
the
force
engaged
in
it
as
he
might
easily
have
done
without
depleting
any
part
of
the
enceinte
for
counting
the
garrison
he
had
infantry
a
larger
number
than
the
french
could
dispose
of
to
send
out
only
seems
to
have
been
a
which
ensured
ultimate
failure
when
the
besiegers
should
have
drawn
together
the
fighting
of
carlos
de
españa
s
men
was
most
creditable
but
there
were
not
enough
of
them
the
french
put
into
action
six
battalions
of
the
and
of
phillipon
s
brigade
two
in
four
in
reserves
and
one
each
of
the
léger
and
the
total
force
of
these
was
according
to
belmas
s
figures
well
over
carlos
de
españa
had
apparently
six
battalions
of
his
own
and
two
or
three
more
from
the
other
divisions
very
much
the
same
force
in
mere
numbers
but
quality
had
also
to
be
taken
into
consideration
la
mare
gives
the
french
loss
as
officers
and
men
killed
officers
and
men
wounded
this
remark
a
very
just
one
is
made
by
arteche
in
his
great
history
ix
on
the
next
day
but
one
mendizabal
withdrew
from
badajoz
the
divisions
of
carlos
de
españa
and
virues
and
part
of
that
of
garcia
leaving
the
original
garrison
strengthened
by
the
remainder
of
the
unit
up
to
a
force
of
men
the
field
army
retired
across
the
river
and
encamped
on
the
strong
position
of
the
heights
of
san
cristobal
its
right
wing
resting
on
the
fort
while
the
remainder
of
its
camps
lay
along
the
reverse
slope
of
the
range
for
a
distance
of
a
mile
and
a
half
there
were
some
infantry
on
the
position
and
the
horse
of
butron
and
madden
were
encamped
behind
it
in
the
plain
of
the
caya
by
some
inconceivable
folly
mendizabal
made
no
attempt
to
use
this
large
force
of
cavalry
which
he
should
have
sent
forward
to
seize
and
hold
the
valley
of
the
gebora
in
front
of
his
position
all
beyond
that
stream
which
flows
at
the
very
foot
of
the
san
cristobal
heights
was
abandoned
to
it
seems
certain
that
the
french
cavalry
general
could
have
been
driven
to
a
respectful
distance
if
a
force
of
all
arms
had
been
sent
against
him
for
he
had
on
the
north
of
the
guadiana
only
five
regiments
of
horse
and
not
a
single
battalion
of
infantry
but
the
spaniard
allowed
himself
to
be
cooped
up
on
the
hill
and
kept
no
guard
of
cavalry
far
out
in
the
plain
to
shield
his
front
and
report
the
motions
of
the
enemy
what
was
worse
he
made
no
attempt
to
entrench
the
long
hillside
though
this
was
a
point
on
which
wellington
and
la
romana
had
given
very
clear
and
definite
instructions
the
position
was
strong
but
as
no
care
was
taken
to
keep
the
enemy
at
a
distance
it
was
always
possible
that
he
might
make
a
sudden
dash
at
it
and
the
spanish
army
scattered
in
its
camps
would
require
time
to
take
up
its
ground
and
form
its
valladolid
osuna
zafra
and
la
serena
now
became
part
of
the
garrison
with
a
strength
of
about
bayonets
for
some
days
after
the
sortie
however
soult
paid
little
attention
to
mendizabal
and
concentrated
all
his
efforts
against
the
fortress
having
completed
the
first
parallel
and
established
several
new
batteries
in
it
he
proceeded
with
his
operations
against
the
pardaleras
fort
his
plan
was
very
daring
not
to
say
hazardous
for
on
the
afternoon
of
the
of
february
when
the
work
was
much
battered
but
still
quite
defensible
he
determined
to
try
to
capture
it
by
escalade
at
dusk
two
columns
making
about
men
issued
from
the
trenches
and
dashed
at
the
pardaleras
the
column
coasting
round
its
flank
made
for
the
gorge
which
was
only
defended
by
a
row
of
palisades
these
were
so
weak
that
they
were
broken
down
or
hewn
to
pieces
by
the
assailants
without
much
difficulty
at
the
same
time
the
right
column
which
had
entered
the
ditch
found
an
open
postern
into
which
it
made
its
way
attacked
on
two
sides
the
garrison
evacuated
the
work
and
fled
into
the
city
leaving
men
killed
or
prisoners
behind
them
the
french
who
had
lost
only
killed
and
wounded
in
this
reckless
venture
established
themselves
in
the
pardaleras
but
the
governor
turned
against
the
fort
all
the
guns
of
the
next
two
bastions
and
the
captors
had
to
burrow
and
lie
low
till
on
the
night
of
the
a
trench
was
run
out
from
the
first
parallel
which
gave
safe
ingress
and
egress
during
the
intervening
day
the
besiegers
lost
more
men
in
holding
the
work
than
they
had
in
storming
it
and
the
pardaleras
close
though
it
was
to
the
walls
proved
to
be
ground
from
which
it
was
most
difficult
to
push
forward
while
the
artillery
fire
of
the
town
was
unsubdued
to
transform
the
open
gorge
in
its
rear
into
a
base
for
new
approaches
was
a
slow
and
expensive
business
and
the
siege
made
a
much
less
rapid
progress
than
had
been
hoped
officers
and
men
killed
and
wounded
according
to
la
mare
de
meanwhile
soult
resolved
to
make
a
blow
at
mendizabal
and
his
field
army
which
was
visible
day
after
day
encamped
on
the
san
cristobal
heights
in
a
position
imposing
but
unfortified
and
the
marshal
had
intended
to
cross
the
guadiana
and
deliver
his
attack
even
before
the
pardaleras
was
taken
but
much
rain
was
falling
and
the
river
had
overflowed
its
banks
so
that
access
to
the
point
where
the
french
had
been
established
a
mile
above
badajoz
was
difficult
moreover
the
gebora
was
also
in
flood
and
reported
to
be
unfordable
though
usually
a
slender
stream
the
only
thing
which
the
marshal
was
able
to
do
between
the
and
the
of
february
was
to
shell
the
nearer
end
of
the
heights
of
san
cristobal
from
the
batteries
in
his
right
attack
with
the
object
of
inducing
the
spanish
battalions
there
encamped
to
move
further
from
the
protection
of
the
fort
which
effectually
covered
their
right
flank
on
february
this
plan
was
seen
to
have
been
effective
the
spaniards
had
withdrawn
from
the
neighbourhood
and
had
left
half
a
mile
unoccupied
between
san
cristobal
and
their
new
camp
on
the
afternoon
of
the
it
was
reported
to
soult
that
both
the
rivers
had
fallen
and
that
the
gebora
had
again
become
fordable
he
made
no
delay
and
at
dusk
his
began
to
cross
the
guadiana
the
operation
was
slow
since
only
two
and
a
few
were
available
but
at
dawn
nine
battalions
three
squadrons
and
two
batteries
were
on
the
north
bank
while
had
come
up
from
his
usual
post
at
montijo
with
six
cavalry
regiments
more
the
whole
force
assembled
in
the
angle
between
the
guadiana
and
the
gebora
amounted
to
no
more
than
infantry
and
horse
with
twelve
guns
a
total
so
much
below
mendizabal
s
infantry
and
cavalry
that
the
adventure
seemed
most
hazardous
but
fortune
often
favours
the
audacious
and
on
this
day
soult
chanced
on
the
unexpected
luck
of
a
very
foggy
morning
he
was
practically
able
to
surprise
the
enemy
for
the
first
warning
that
a
battle
was
at
hand
only
came
to
mendizabal
when
shortly
after
dawn
his
picket
at
the
broken
bridge
of
the
gebora
a
short
mile
or
so
in
front
of
the
heights
was
driven
in
by
masses
of
french
infantry
at
the
same
moment
a
tumult
broke
out
on
his
left
rear
the
hussars
sent
on
by
to
discover
and
turn
the
spanish
northern
flank
had
been
able
to
mount
the
heights
unseen
and
unopposed
by
making
a
long
détour
and
rode
unexpectedly
into
the
camp
of
one
of
carlos
de
españa
s
regiments
mendizabal
s
troops
flew
to
arms
and
began
hastily
to
form
their
line
upon
the
heights
but
they
had
no
time
to
get
into
good
order
for
the
enemy
was
upon
them
within
a
few
minutes
three
battalions
each
of
the
and
line
thirteen
squadrons
of
the
and
dragoons
the
and
hussars
the
and
chasseurs
and
the
spanish
light
cavalry
regiment
of
juramentados
mortier
to
whom
soult
had
committed
the
conduct
of
the
battle
showed
great
tactical
skill
on
reaching
the
line
of
the
gebora
infantry
and
cavalry
poured
across
it
without
a
moment
s
delay
all
the
three
fords
of
which
the
french
knew
proved
to
be
practicable
though
on
the
southernmost
one
near
the
bridge
the
infantry
had
to
cross
with
the
chilly
water
up
to
their
waists
the
order
of
battle
was
very
simple
the
right
wing
composed
of
the
whole
of
the
cavalry
was
to
pass
by
the
most
northern
ford
and
ascend
the
heights
beyond
the
spanish
left
arrived
at
the
crest
one
brigade
was
to
push
along
it
and
fall
on
the
flank
of
the
hostile
line
while
the
other
descended
into
the
valley
of
the
caya
and
charged
into
the
spanish
camps
so
placing
itself
directly
in
mendizabal
s
rear
of
the
infantry
three
battalions
the
regiment
were
to
ascend
the
hillside
in
the
gap
between
the
fort
of
san
cristobal
and
the
nearest
spanish
camp
a
gap
which
had
been
caused
as
it
will
be
remembered
by
the
withdrawal
of
the
spaniards
from
the
southernmost
heights
under
the
stress
of
bombardment
six
days
before
this
column
was
to
risk
the
fire
of
the
fort
which
it
had
to
disregard
and
fall
on
the
hostile
flank
meanwhile
the
centre
very
weak
and
composed
only
of
six
battalions
of
infantry
and
regiments
was
to
attack
the
spanish
front
when
the
two
turning
movements
were
well
developed
the
san
cristobal
heights
are
a
most
formidable
position
two
miles
of
smooth
steep
slopes
with
an
altitude
of
feet
overlooking
the
whole
plain
of
the
gebora
and
with
hardly
any
dead
ground
in
their
sides
they
form
an
excellent
for
an
army
in
position
ready
to
defend
itself
by
its
fire
for
the
assailant
must
come
up
the
hill
at
a
slow
pace
and
utterly
exposed
cavalry
could
only
climb
at
a
walk
and
with
difficulty
but
mortier
had
sent
all
his
horse
far
to
the
north
where
they
ascended
and
partly
crossed
the
range
at
its
lowest
point
beyond
the
extreme
flank
of
the
enemy
just
at
this
moment
the
fog
rose
and
everything
became
visible
on
gaining
the
heights
unopposed
briche
s
light
cavalry
formed
up
across
them
and
commenced
to
move
along
the
summit
towards
the
spanish
left
wing
while
with
three
dragoon
regiments
descended
the
reverse
slope
and
moved
towards
the
hostile
camp
in
front
of
which
butron
s
spanish
horse
and
madden
s
portuguese
could
be
seen
hastily
arraying
their
squadrons
it
may
be
said
that
the
battle
of
the
gebora
was
lost
almost
before
a
shot
had
been
fired
for
on
seeing
themselves
threatened
in
flank
and
about
to
be
charged
by
the
spanish
and
portuguese
horse
broke
in
the
most
disgraceful
style
disregarding
the
orders
of
their
commanders
and
went
off
in
a
disorderly
mass
across
the
plain
of
the
caya
towards
elvas
and
campo
mayor
they
outnumbered
the
enemy
and
could
have
saved
the
day
if
they
had
fought
even
a
bad
and
unsuccessful
action
so
as
to
detain
the
french
dragoons
for
a
single
hour
but
the
cavalry
of
the
army
of
estremadura
had
a
bad
reputation
they
were
the
old
squadrons
of
medellin
and
arzobispo
of
which
wellington
preserved
such
an
evil
memory
and
madden
s
portuguese
this
day
behaved
no
better
they
escaped
almost
without
loss
for
let
them
fly
and
turned
at
once
against
the
flank
and
rear
of
mendizabal
s
infantry
see
his
pathetic
letter
in
wellington
vii
the
combat
on
the
southern
part
of
the
heights
had
not
yet
assumed
a
desperate
aspect
though
the
column
which
was
formed
by
the
regiment
had
got
up
the
hillside
under
the
fort
of
san
cristobal
and
had
penetrated
into
the
gap
between
that
work
and
its
extreme
left
the
spanish
infantry
was
still
holding
its
own
the
fog
having
cleared
they
were
able
to
estimate
the
smallness
of
the
number
of
the
hostile
infantry
and
stood
to
fight
without
showing
any
signs
of
failing
but
the
fusilade
was
only
just
beginning
all
along
the
hillside
when
the
victorious
french
cavalry
came
into
action
briche
s
light
horse
came
galloping
along
the
crest
of
the
heights
while
s
dragoons
were
visible
in
the
plain
behind
well
to
the
rear
of
the
spanish
line
mendizabal
horrified
at
the
sight
ordered
his
men
to
form
squares
not
as
usual
by
battalions
but
vast
divisional
squares
each
formed
of
many
regiments
and
with
artillery
in
their
angles
if
the
french
cavalry
alone
had
been
present
it
is
possible
that
in
this
formation
the
spaniards
might
have
saved
themselves
but
mortier
s
infantry
was
also
up
and
well
engaged
in
bickering
with
mendizabal
s
men
the
squares
when
formed
with
some
difficulty
found
themselves
exposed
to
a
heavy
fire
of
musketry
from
the
front
at
the
same
moment
that
the
cavalry
blow
was
delivered
on
their
flank

were

the
french
loss
though
by
soult
in
his
dispatch
at
the
ridiculous
figure
of
killed
and
wounded
was
in
truth
very
small
not
exceeding
in
all
it
fell
almost
entirely
on
the
cavalry
who
had
done
practically
the
whole
of
the
work

returns
show
that
only
four
officers
in
the
infantry
were
killed
or
wounded

thirteen
in
the
mounted

proportion
this
battle
was
more
disastrous
to
the
vanquished
and
less
costly
to
the
victors
than
even
medellin
or
ocaña
it
is
difficult
to
write
with
patience
of
the
culpable
negligence
of
mendizabal
in
allowing
himself
to
be
surprised
in
such
a
position
when
he
was
amply
provided
with
cavalry
or
of
the
conduct
of
the
spanish
and
portuguese
horse
in
abandoning
their
infantry
without
striking
a
single
blow
when
even
a
show
of
resistance
might
at
least
have
given
their
comrades
time
to
save
themselves
for
the
battalions
on
the
heights
could
have
escaped
into
badajoz
or
even
have
retreated
along
the
guadiana
without
desperate
loss
if
they
had
been
granted
an
hour
s
respite
while
if
the
french
cavalry
could
have
been
detained
till
the
infantry
battle
on
the
heights
was
decided
it
is
quite
clear
that
mendizabal
in
his
splendid
fighting
position
and
with
double
numbers
could
have
held
his
own
and
driven
off
the
attack
of
the
nine
battalions
of
mortier
the
statement
that
only
a
few
men
escaped
into
badajoz
is
disproved
by
the
figures
of
the
of

which
show
men
of

of

of

at

besiege
badajoz
from

sides

on
being

he

on

bank
to

there
was
still
much
to
be

the

menacho

resolute
and
the
garrison
had
been
raised
to
over

by
the

the

have
been
prolonged
to
a

greater
duration
if
menacho
had
not
been
killed
on

as
long
as
he
lived
the
defence
was
vigorous
and
honourable
though
soult
could
concentrate
all
his
attention
on
the
approaches
towards
the
curtain
between
the
bastions
of
santiago
and
san
juan
they
did
not
progress
very
rapidly
menacho
brought
up
all
the
artillery
that
could
be
readily
moved
on
the
threatened
front
and
continued
to
pound
the
ruins
of
the
pardaleras
and
the
trenches
leading
up
to
it
it
was
only
on
the
night
of
the
february
that
a
battery
was
at
last
completed
under
the
right
flank
of
the
fort
and
another
under
its
left
to
keep
down
the
fire
of
the
defenders
nor
was
it
till
the
of
the
same
month
and
the
of
march
that
the
zigzags
began
to
creep
forward
from
the
second
parallel
towards
the
body
of
the
place
on
the
of
march
the
approaches
reached
the
outside
the
bastion
of
san
juan
and
the
french
could
look
down
into
the
ditch
but
they
found
the
counterscarp
in
good
order
and
the
palisades
intact
on
the
they
commenced
mining
with
the
object
of
blowing
in
the
counterscarp
and
filling
the
ditch
but
their
work
was
stopped
by
a
vigorous
sortie
the
last
which
menacho
sent
out
a
small
column
of
spaniards
passed
out
of
the
left
bastion
seized
and
demolished
the
advanced
trenches
and
spiked
the
twelve
guns
which
armed
the
two
nearest
batteries
the
progress
of
the
besiegers
was
checked
for
a
day
but
at
a
disastrous
cost
for
the
governor
himself
while
watching
the
effect
of
the
sortie
from
the
ramparts
was
killed
by
a
chance
shot
his
place
was
taken
by
the
senior
brigadier
in
the
place
josé
imaz
a
man
of
desponding
heart
and
utterly
lacking
in
energy
it
was
a
thousand
pities
that
when
the
rout
of
the
gebora
took
place
neither
la
carrera
nor
carlos
de
españa
had
been
driven
back
into
badajoz
for
both
these
officers
were
men
of
desperate
resolution
who
would
have
played
out
a
losing
game
to
the
last
moment
with
stubborn
courage
the
french
narratives
note
that
from
the
moment
of
menacho
s
death
the
defence
slackened
it
became
partly
passive
and
was
no
longer
conducted
with
common
skill
no
more
sorties
were
made
and
there
seemed
to
be
a
lack
of
ingenuity
in
the
measures
taken
to
resist
the
completion
of
the
approaches
all
that
was
done
was
to
keep
up
a
hot
fire
on
the
head
of
the
french
sap
and
to
replace
one
disabled
gun
by
another
upon
the
walls

on
the
of
march
the
besiegers
had
lodged
themselves
solidly
in
the
of
the
bastion
of
san
juan
and
had
commenced
on
the
very
edge
of
the
ditch
a
battery
for
six
heavy
guns
which
were
to
work
upon
the
curtain
between
san
juan
and
santiago
the
place
selected
for
the
breaching
on
the
the
embrasures
were
completed
on
the
the
guns
were
got
into
position
on
the
the
counterscarp
was
blown
in
by
a
mine
and
the
battery
began
to
play
upon
the
walls
at
a
distance
of
only
sixty
yards
though
the
besieged
kept
up
a
terrible
fire
upon
it
and
killed
many
gunners
its
effect
was
all
that
the
french
had
desired
the
ramparts
began
to
crumble
and
on
the
morning
of
the
there
was
a
breach
seventy
feet
wide
in
the
curtain
near
the
bastion
of
santiago
while
the
ditch
was
half
filled
with
débris
the
engineers
pronounced
that
an
assault
was
practicable
though
another
day
s
fire
would
be
desirable
to
finish
the
business
the
spanish
guns
on
the
front
attacked
were
all
silenced
but
from
the
flanking
bastions
a
fire
was
still
kept
up
which
would
obviously
be
very
murderous
to
the
storming
columns
it
was
clear
that
it
would
be
better
to
subdue
it
and
to
batter
the
breach
into
an
easier
slope
before
the
assault
should
be
delivered
soult
however
was
anxious
to
press
matters
for
he
had
received
on
the
two
pieces
of
news
which
completely
changed
the
strategical
situation
the
first
was
that
masséna
had
given
orders
for
the
evacuation
of
santarem
and
his
other
positions
on
the
tagus
five
days
before
and
had
already
commenced
his
retreat
towards
the
north
there
was
no
longer
any
chance
of
joining
the
army
of
portugal
and
attacking
wellington
indeed
it
was
probable
that
the
english
general
would
find
himself
free
to
make
a
large
detachment
against
the
besiegers
of
badajoz
and
that
if
the
town
should
not
fall
within
the
next
ten
days
beresford
s
men
from
the
south
bank
of
the
tagus
would
appear
at
elvas
or
campo
mayor
ready
to
attack
the
in
the
rear
and
soult
from
his
experiences
of
was
quite
aware
that
to
meet
an
army
would
not
be
a
business
like
that
of
the
gebora
but
this
was
not
all
news
of
the
most
disquieting
kind
had
just
arrived
from
andalusia
victor
reported
from
in
front
of
cadiz
that
a
large
expeditionary
force
comprising
an
english
division
had
landed
at
algesiras
and
tarifa
on
february
had
moved
into
the
inland
and
was
evidently
about
to
attack
his
from
the
rear
he
expressed
grave
doubts
as
to
the
situation
daricau
the
governor
of
seville
had
even
a
worse
report
to
make
the
roving
division
of
ballasteros
which
had
been
driven
into
portugal
by
gazan
on
january
had
recrossed
the
spanish
frontier
the
moment
that
its
pursuers
had
retired
had
invaded
the
condado
de
niebla
and
had
inflicted
a
severe
defeat
on
remond
whose
small
corps
had
been
left
to
cover
that
region
on
the
rio
tinto
march
daricau
reported
that
the
spaniards
were
marching
on
seville
and
that
after
leaving
a
skeleton
garrison
of
convalescents
and
in
the
city
he
was
moving
out
with
a
field
force
of
no
more
than
bayonets
to
rally
remond
s
men
and
fight
at
san
lucar
la
mayor
for
the
protection
of
the
capital
of
andalusia
ballasteros
was
believed
to
have
a
considerable
force
and
the
result
was
doubtful
on
the
morning
of
the
of
march
therefore
soult
was
in
no
small
distress
concerning
the
fate
of
daricau
and
victor
whose
last
dispatches
were
now
six
or
seven
days
old
and
who
might
have
suffered
disasters
for
all
that
he
knew
since
those
dispatches
were
written
if
modern
methods
of
communication
had
existed
in
he
would
have
known
already
that
victor
had
suffered
a
complete
and
bloody
defeat
at
barrosa
on
march
he
was
therefore
prepared
to
take
great
risks
at
badajoz
in
order
to
have
his
army
free
at
any
cost
for
the
succour
of
andalusia
mortier
was
ordered
to
get
all
ready
for
a
storm
during
the
course
of
the
afternoon
but
meanwhile
when
a
few
hours
battering
after
dawn
had
somewhat
improved
the
slope
of
the
breach
a
was
sent
into
badajoz
at
to
summon
imaz
to
capitulate
the
letter
which
he
bore
was
couched
in
such
elaborate
terms
of
politeness
complimenting
the
spaniards
on
their
long
and
gallant
resistance
and
intimating
that
the
most
honourable
terms
would
be
granted
that
the
governor
should
have
suspected
that
soult
was
not
sure
of
his
ground
but
to
a
man
cowed
in
spirit
and
weighed
down
by
a
responsibility
too
great
for
him
such
hints
were
useless
imaz
summoned
a
council
of
war
the
regular
refuge
of
weak
commanders
and
called
into
it
a
veritable
crowd
of
councillors
not
only
the
three
generals
and
four
brigadiers
present
in
the
city
the
chief
engineer
and
two
artillery
officers
but
nearly
a
score
of
and
majors
commanding
all
the
battalions
represented
in
the
garrison
unfortunately
the
engineer
colonel
julian
alvo
who
led
off
the
discussion
was
the
most
downhearted
man
of
all
he
reported
that
the
breach
was
from
thirty
to
ells
broad
and
accessible
as
it
had
an
angle
of
to
fifty
degrees
that
there
had
been
great
difficulty
in
throwing
up
retrenchments
and
inner
defences
behind
it
because
at
this
point
the
of
the
streets
of
the
town
was
much
lower
than
that
of
the
ramparts
he
pointed
out
that
to
garrison
the
whole
enceinte
with
a
minimum
force
would
absorb
men
which
would
leave
only
to
defend
the
breach
as
to
the
number
and
of
the
troops
the
regimental
officers
would
be
able
to
speak
with
better
knowledge
than
but
he
held
that
if
the
first
assault
were
repulsed
the
fall
of
the
town
would
only
be
delayed
two
or
three
days
if
there
were
evidence
that
the
place
might
be
relieved
from
outside
within
that
time
it
was
proper
to
resist
to
the
last
if
not
he
thought
that
the
heroic
garrison
and
the
city
ought
not
to
be
sacrificed
for
they
had
fully
done
their
duty
and
badajoz
as
a
fortress
was
full
of
defects
for
all
these
interesting
details
see
the
verbatim
report
of
the
council
of
war
in
the
appendix
to
arteche
vii
pp
twelve
colonels
and
majors
gave
their
opinions
in
almost
the
same
terms
as
the
engineer
many
repeating
his
actual
phrases
some
adding
that
the
rank
and
file
were
demoralized
others
that
they
were
few
in
number
they
actually
were
only
less
than
the
infantry
of
the
besieging
force
on
the
other
hand
the
commanding
artillery
officer
joaquin
caamano
set
forth
a
very
different
case
the
enemy
has
not
yet
subdued
the
fire
of
the
place
the
bastions
flanking
the
breach
are
intact
and
have
their
guns
in
order
the
breach
itself
has
been
mined
and
a
parapet
behind
it
has
been
thrown
up
during
the
last
night
in
spite
of
the
arguments
of
the
commander
of
the
engineers
the
assault
ought
to
be
resisted
or
as
an
alternative
the
garrison
ought
to
try
to
cut
its
way
out
by
the
north
bank
towards
elvas
or
campo
caamano
was
supported
by
the
vote
of
another
artilleryman
the
portuguese

commanding
a
company
which
beresford
had
sent

the

the

then
came
the
oddest
part
of
the
proceedings
the
governor
gave
as
his
opinion
that
though
an
inner
line
of
defence
has
not
been
contrived
and
though
very
few
guns
still
remain
serviceable
in
the
bastions
of
santiago
san
josé
and
san
juan
and
though
we
have
no
succour
for
sustaining
the
assault
i
think
we
should
defend
the
place
with
valour
and
constancy
to
our
last
after
which
he
at
once
commenced
negotiations
with
the
french
in
direct
contradiction
to
his
own
vote
apparently
he
thought
that
thirteen
votes
for
surrender
against
four
for
resistance
among
his
councillors
covered
his
ignominy
the
worst
part
of
his
conduct
was
that
he
was
aware
that
an
army
of
succour
was
on
the
march
to
help
him
for
badajoz
had
semaphore
communication
with
elvas
and
on
the
preceding
day
the
portuguese
general
leite
had
telegraphed
to
him
by
wellington
s
orders
that
beresford
had
been
detached
with
two
divisions
to
hasten
to
his
aid
on
march
as
a
matter
of
fact
beresford
s
movement
into
estremadura
was
retarded
and
his
corps
did
not
move
off
for
some
days
later
but
imaz
did
not
know
this
and
he
was
certainly
guilty
of
concealing
from
his
officers
that
prompt
succour
had
been
promised
and
was
actually
upon
its
way
the
whole
responsibility
for
the
surrender
falls
on
him
because
he
allowed
alvo
and
the
other
voters
for
capitulation
to
produce
uncontradicted
the
statement
that
no
relief
was
probable
while
he
knew
himself
that
it
had
been
promised
it
is
impossible
to
deny
that
this
was
pusillanimity

into
and
over
the
border
of
treason

for

additional
on
the
evening
of

the

was
stopped
on

that

by

and
laid
down

they
numbered

there
were

been

almost
the

is

that
if

would
have
held
out
till
it
was
relieved
by
beresford
for
the
latter
who
was

ordered
to
move
to
its
relief

would
have
reached
its

on

if
he
had
not
been
checked
on
the
first
day
of
his
start
by
the
news
that
the
city
had
fallen
after
the
need
for
hurry
had
been
removed
by
this
disheartening
intelligence
he
moved
slowly
but
was
in

of

than
ten
miles
from

was
known
to
wellington
and

on
the
or
the
night
of
the
as
is
shown
by

vii
there
is
hardly
ever
an
excuse
for
a
governor
who
surrenders
without
having
withstood
at
least
one
assault
and
napoleon
laid
down
the
general
rule
that
any
officer
so
doing
should
be
sent
before
a
court
martial
imaz
with
his
large
garrison
his
immense
artillery
resources
and
his
certainty
of
being
relieved
in
ten
days
was
least
of
all
men
in
a
condition
to
plead
justification
it
is
only
necessary
to
compare
him
with
alvarez
at
gerona
who
with
a
smaller
garrison
and
a
far
weaker
fortress
held
out
for
three
months
after
not
one
but
three
large
breaches
had
been
made
in
his
weak
mediaeval
enceinte
the
regency
very
properly
ordered
imaz
to
be
put
on
his
trial
but
the
proceedings
which
only
commenced
when
the
french
liberated
him
dragged
on
interminably
and
had
not
come
to
an
end
when
the
war
ceased
in
if
ever
there
was
a
case
where
an
example
in
the
style
of
admiral
byng
encourager
les
could
have
been
rightfully
made
this
was
one
soult
relieved
from
desperate
anxiety
by
imaz
s
surrender
had
no
other
thought
than
to
return
as
quickly
as
possible
to
andalusia
leaving
mortier
at
badajoz
with
sixteen
battalions
and
five
regiments
of
cavalry
about
men
he
started
back
for
seville
on
the
third
day
after
the
capitulation
taking
with
him
two
regiments
of
dragoons
and
the
bulk
of
gazan
s
division
as
he
marched
he
was
in
fear
that
any
hour
might
bring
the
news
that
daricau
had
lost
seville
or
that
victor
had
been
forced
to
abandon
the
siege
of
cadiz
for
the
report
of
the
bloody
defeat
of
barrosa
march
had
reached
him
on
the
of
march
and
heightened
his
anxiety
but
he
reached
seville
on
march
to
find
that
the
situation
might
yet
be
saved
and
that
andalusia
was
still
his
own
less
two
battalions
left
in
badajoz
as
garrison
and
the
of
the
line
also
left
with
mortier
his
achievements
during
the
two
months
of
his
estremaduran
campaign
had
indeed
been
splendid
with
an
army
not
exceeding
men
and
operating
in
the
worst
of
weather
he
had
taken
two
fortresses
won
a
battle
in
the
open
field
and
captured
prisoners
the
spanish
army
of
estremadura
which
had
seemed
so
powerful
at
the
commencement
of
his
campaign
was
almost
exterminated
and
the
frontier
of
portugal
was
laid
open
soult
had
redeemed
his
promise
to
make
a
powerful
diversion
in
favour
of
masséna
and
it
is
hard
to
see
how
he
could
have
done
more
for
he
could
not
have
moved
to
the
tagus
before
badajoz
fell
and
thanks
to
the
courage
of
menacho
that
city
had
held
out
till
eight
days
after
the
date
on
which
masséna
ordered
the
army
of
portugal
to
commence
its
retreat
to
the
north
wellington
s
plan
of
starvation
had
after
all
achieved
its
effect
and
masséna
had
been
driven
out
of
his
position
before
soult
was
in
a
position
to
come
to
his
aid
even
if
masséna
had
stayed
a
little
longer
at
santarem
it
seems
hard
to
believe
that
soult
could
have
joined
him
considering
that
elvas
a
place
stronger
than
badajoz
was
in
his
front
and
that
the
news
from
andalusia
spelt
utter
ruin
unless
he
should
return
to
save
it
he
must
have
done
so
even
if
on
march
the
army
of
portugal
had
still
been
in
its
old
position

there
was
no
serious
movement
of
any
part
of
the
french

the
british
armies
for
some
weeks
the
weather
was
bad

on

sides
remained
in

of

alone
the

alive
the
ranks
of

battalions
continued
to
grow
thinner
but
not
at
such
a
rate
as
in
november
and
december
for
the
weakly
men
had
already
been
weeded
out
by
the
dreadful
mortality
of
the
preceding
period
provisions
had
daily
to
be
sought
further
and
further
afield
but
they
were
not
wholly
exhausted
the
marshal
waited
anxiously
for
further
news
from
paris
and
for
tidings
that
the
army
of
andalusia
was
coming
to
his
aid
but
after

no
further
information
got
through
for
five
weeks
for

with
their
militia
as
effectually
as
in
the
time
before
the

started
from
almeida
wellington
for
his
part
was
waiting
for
his
great
scheme
of
starvation
to
work
out
to
its
logical
end
he
had
as
has
already
been
observed
somewhat
underrated
the
time
for
which
the
french
would
be
able
to
live
on
the
resources
of
the
country
that
he
dominated
more
than
once
in
december
and
january
he
thought
that
he
had
detected
the
signs
of
a
coming
retreat
and
had
been
disappointed
the
enemy
still
remained
in
his
old
cantonments
and
nothing
more
than
petty
movements
of
small
units
had
taken
place
this
anxious
waiting
was
as
might
have
been
expected
trying
to
wellington
s
temper
he
was
not
shaken
in
his
belief
that
he
had
made
the
right
decision
but
it
was
exasperating
to
see
the
deadlock
on
the
tagus
continuing
far
beyond
his
expectations
and
the
estremaduran
campaign
developing
behind
his
back
during
the
long
weeks
of
tension
the
strain
on
his
mind
vented
itself
in
criticism
reasonable
and
unreasonable
of
the
authorities
with
whom
he
had
to
work

the
administration
of
spencer
perceval
had
done
its
best
to
maintain
the
war
and
to
support
its
general
under
great
difficulties
it
had
not
shrunk
from
making
financial
exertions
of
the
most
unprecedented
kind
in
order
to
keep
up
the
war
in
portugal
as
lord
liverpool
pointed
out
to
wellington
the
army
in
the
peninsula
had
cost
in
in
in
the
sum
asked
for
had
risen
to
more
than
double
the
total
of
either
of
the
preceding
years
and
this
did
not
include
either
ordnance
stores
supplies
sent
out
in
kind
or
the
hire
of
transports
which
were
calculated
to
make
out
more
the
government
had
provided
these
sums
in
face
of
a
bitter
and
carping
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
whigs
and
despite
of
much
lukewarmness
among
their
own
followers
of
whom
many
considered
that
the
limit
of
reasonable
expense
had
been
reached
as
lord
liverpool
observed
the
increase
of
the
portuguese
subsidy
and
the
taking
into
british
pay
of
the
larger
half
of
the
portuguese
army
had
been
carried
by
a
small
and
unwilling
majority
the
government
had
driven
the
money
bills
through
the
house
of
commons
only
by
smart
cracking
of
the
whip
of
party
loyalty
they
had
promised
wellington
that
his
army
should
be
increased
by
men
during
the
course
of
the
winter
and
the
promise
was
in
the
course
of
fulfilment
many
regiments
had
already
arrived
all
were
to
reach
the
tagus
before
march
was
out
this
had
been
done
in
a
time
of
dire
distress
to
the
tory
party
george
iii
had
been
prostrated
by
his
last
attack
of
insanity
which
was
destined
to
be
permanent
in
october
as
it
became
certain
that
his
recovery
was
not
to
be
looked
for
the
appointment
of
the
prince
of
wales
as
regent
was
the
obvious
and
necessary
corollary
but
the
prince
was
still
reckoned
a
whig
and
it
was
believed
with
reason
that
his
first
act
on
coming
into
power
would
be
to
dismiss
the
perceval
ministry
and
to
call
upon
grey
grenville
and
sheridan
to
form
an
administration
the
tories
all
through
the
winter
thought
that
they
were
destined
to
immediate
expulsion
from
office
and
had
before
them
a
long
strife
with
the
crown
it
was
only
at
the
beginning
of
february
that
the
younger
george
who
had
taken
the
oath
as
regent
on
the
of
that
month
announced
to
the
general
surprise
of
the
nation
that
he
had
no
intention
of
dismissing
the
ministry
and
was
prepared
to
work
with
them
perceval
and
liverpool
during
the
three
preceding
months
were
doing
their
best
for
the
army
in
portugal
while
they
believed
that
a
political
disaster
was
hanging
over
their
heads
they
did
not
yet
realize
that
the
prince
s
whig
principles
had
worn
thin
of
late
and
that
he
was
tired
of
the
dictatorial
manners
which
grey
and
grenville
had
adopted
towards
him
lord
liverpool
to
wellington
february
lord
liverpool

september
it
is
terrible
to
contemplate
the
results
which
might
have
followed
had
the
whigs
come
into
office
at
this
juncture
they
were
pledged
to
the
theory
that
the
peninsular
war
was
hopeless
and
ought
to
be
abandoned
grey
and
grenville
had
stated
that
wellington
was
a
failure
they
had
denied
that
talavera
was
a
victory
brougham
had
summarized
the
feelings
of
the
party
in
a
savage
attack
upon
both
government
and
general
in
the
at
this
very
moment
february
ponsonby
the
leader
of
the
opposition
in
the
house
of
commons
was
preaching
that
france
can
not
be
prevented
from
overrunning
spain
by
continuing
a
war
in
portugal
so
that
neither
in
spain
or
portugal
has
anything
happened
that
can
give
reason
to
believe
that
the
war
will
ever
terminate
to
our
advantage
freemantle
another
leader
maintained
that
bonaparte
having
conquered
the
rest
of
the
continent
must
also
conquer
the
peninsula
because
he
has
greater
numbers
to
bring
up
after
every
defeat
and
therefore
defeat
of
one
of
his
armies
was
vain
every
whig
journal
was
prophesying
the
expulsion
of
wellington
from
portugal
within
a
few
weeks
as
indeed
they
had
been
doing
ever
since
october
hansard
for
vol
xix
plumer
ward
s
i
all
honour
therefore
is
due
to
the
statesmen
who
continued
in
the
midst
of
all
their
own
troubles
constitutional
and
financial
to
give
a
steady
support
to
wellington
and
to
redeem
the
pledges
which
they
had
made
to
him
when
napier
in
his
great
history
declares
that
the
ministry
betrayed
wellington
that
perceval
had
neither
the
wisdom
to
support
nor
the
manliness
to
put
an
end
to
the
war
in
the
peninsula
his
crooked
contemptible
policy
was
shown
by
withholding
what
was
necessary
to
continue
the
contest
and
throwing
upon
the
general
the
responsibility
of
failure
he
is
merely
venting
the
malignant
folly
of
the
whigs
of
his
day
which
ought
to
have
been
forgotten
by
the
time
that
he
took
his
pen
in
hand
long
after
the
war
was
over
it
is
unfortunately
true
that
wellington
in
the
stress
of
waiting
hours
during
the
winter
of
used
querulous
and
captious
language
concerning
his
supporters
at
home
the
main
point
of
his
complaint
was
that
he
was
not
supplied
rapidly
enough
with
specie
that
bills
were
sent
him
when
he
wanted
dollars
or
guineas
and
that
so
the
pay
of
the
army
was
falling
into
arrears
the
fact
was
deplorable
but
on
a
consideration
of
the
condition
of
the
english
monetary
system
at
this
date
it
is
hard
to
see
how
the
difficulty
could
have
been
avoided
since
the
suspension
of
the
coinage
of
guineas
in
and
the
introduction
of
an
almost
unlimited
issue
of
gold
had
gradually
become
an
almost
invisible
commodity
in
great
britain
the
guinea
when
seen
commanded
an
premium
by
it
was
worth
or
more
in
paper
british
silver
was
equally
deficient
there
had
been
none
coined
at
the
mint
since
and
the
internal
trade
of
the
country
was
being
transacted
with
difficulty

the

was

was

when

was

it
was
certainly
an

that

could
look
upon
the
whole
situation
as
one
in
which
the
government
chooses
to
undertake
large
services
and
not
to
supply
us
with
sufficient
pecuniary
means
and
could
write
that
the
present

complained
so
much
of

a
remark
made
not
in

but
in
march
when
masséna
had
actually
retreated
from
the

this
rather
unjustifiable
complaint
was
probably
the
direct
result
of
lord
liverpool
s
letter
of
february
in
which
he
had
set
forth
at
length
the
enormous
burden
of
the
war
and
expressed
his
doubts
as
to
whether
the
augmentation
of
the
peninsular
army
by
men
for
which
he
had
just
provided
could
be
permanently
kept
up
he
suggested
that
when
the
present
crisis
masséna
s
presence
at
the
gates
of
lisbon
had
come
to
an
end
the
army
should
send
home
some
of
its
less
effective
regiments
and
that
the
ideal
of
effective
rank
and
file
not
including
the
garrison
of
cadiz
would
probably
have
to
be
kept
in
mind
but
long
before
the
dispatch
of
february
wellington
thought
that
he
had
detected
an
intention
on
liverpool
s
part
to
bring
the
whole
peninsular
war
to
an
end
on
financial
grounds
and
wrote
most
bitterly
to
his
kinsman
pole
accusing
the
secretary
of
state
of
being
and
showing
a
distrust
of
his
influence
in
the
cabinet
all
this
was
forgotten
when
the
firmness
of
the
ministry
in
support
of
the
war
became
evident
and
in
later
years
wellington
wrote
to
acknowledge
in
the
most
handsome
style
the
support
that
he
had
received
from
the
perceval
administration
to
charles
stuart

the
recent
augmentation
of
your
force
must
be
considered
as
made
with
reference
to
the

exigency
we
are
very
anxious
not
with
a
view
of
abandoning
but
for
the
purpose
of
maintaining
the
contest
in
the
peninsula
for
an
indefinite
time
that
when
the

shall
appear
to
be

you
should
send

the
excess
of
your

which
are

efficient
and

writes
this
was
unfair
perceval
and
liverpool
had
deliberately
turned
their
backs
upon
pitt
s
old
policy
of
spasmodic
efforts
all
over
the
world
in
favour
of
a
steady
and
persistent
feeding
of
the
war
in
one
quarter
the
peninsula
wellington
himself
had
approved
the
change
in
his
letters
of
had
named
the
amount
of
money
that
he
wanted
and
fixed
the
figure
of
the
reinforcements
that
he
asked
but
in
he
never
ceased
to
ask
for
more
men
and
more
money
till
liverpool
was
obliged
to
remind
him
very
gently
that
he
was
going
far
beyond
his
own
he
had
got
to
the
stage
of
writing
that
government
having
embarked
on
the
contest
and
chosen
the
best
officer
they
could
find
must
give
him
the
largest
army
they
could
collect
and
reinforce
it
to
the
utmost
without
asking
precisely
how
many
men
were
wanted
and
for
what
precise
objects
it
was
fortescue
who
indicated
to
me
two
important
passages
about
liverpool
which
are
omitted
from
the
printed
version
of
wellington
s
letters
to

during
all
these
weeks
of
waiting
wellington
was
also
troubled
by
problems
with
regard
to
the
internal
state
of
portugal
two
main
sources
of
worry
can
be
traced
in
his
correspondence
the
first
was
the
inefficiency
of
the
portuguese
commissariat
which
bid
fair
to
cause
absolute
starvation
among
those
brigades
of
the
national
army
which
were
not
incorporated
with
british
divisions
and
supplied
from
the
british
stores
slow
and
irregular
forwarding
of
provisions
to
the
corps
stationed
in
advanced
or
remote
positions
led
to
a
dreadful
increase
in
the
number
of
sick
we
find
wellington
complaining
that
regiments
which
had
men
in
line
at
bussaco
could
only
show
or
under
arms
in
february
although
they
had
received
considerable
drafts
from
their
dépôts
at
midwinter
d
urban
s
daily
notes
bear
out
the
statements
of
the
he
asserts
with
indignation
that
by
the
villany
of
commissaries
the
same
quantity
of
flour
which
provided
rations
for
the
british
soldier
was
returned
as
having
given
only
to
the
portuguese
the
balance
having
been
embezzled
allowances
of
course
must
be
made
for
the
difficulties
of
a
government
of
whose
territory
a
good
third
had
been
depopulated
by
the
orders
of
wellington
but
the
trouble
does
not
seem
to
have
been
so
much
the
actual
want
of
at
head
quarters
great
quantities
were
got
from
the
alemtejo
and
the
north
as
the
inefficiency
of
distribution
which
left
outlying
brigades
sometimes
foodless
for
two
or
three
days
at
a
time
clothing
and
shoes
were
also
very
slow
in
arriving
at
the
front
at
the
bottom
the
cause
of
all
this
inefficiency
was
probably
as
wellington
observes
in
one
letter
the
want
of
money
to
keep
up
an
adequate
transport
service
and
it
might
be
pleaded
that
in
the
distressful
condition
of
the
country
the
deficit
was
no
fault
of
the
government
but
unavoidable
wellington
s
view
was
that
with
greater
economy
in
civil
expenses
and
more
careful
supervision
of
commissaries
and
contractors
there
was
money
enough
to
pay
for
all
necessary
military
objects
he
was
probably
right
but
there
is
small
wonder
if
a
provisional
government
like
the
regency
found
it
hard
to
introduce
administrative
reforms
in
the
midst
of
a
crisis
and
with
the
enemy
almost
at
the
gates
of
the
capital
after
all
the
effort
which
portugal
had
made
was
splendid
and
the
whole
nation
had
accepted
the
awful
necessity
of
the
depopulation
of
its
central
provinces
with
a
loyalty
that
was
surprising
if
we
consider
the
magnitude
of
the
sacrifice
see
wellington
to
beresford
from
cartaxo
february
vii
ibid
the
cause
of
the
state
of
deficiency
is
the
old
want
of
money
to
pay
for
there
was
however
a
small
minority
of
traitors
still
left
in
portugal
and
their
intrigues
seem
to
have
given
wellington
much
concern
not
because
there
was
any
danger
from
their
personal
action
but
because
they
conveyed
to
masséna
the
intelligence
as
to
the
condition
of
affairs
in
lisbon
and
in
europe
at
large
which
he
could
not
obtain
in
any
other
way
owing
to
the
strict
blockade
kept
up
around
his
rear
on
the
last
day
of
the
old
year
four
officers
two
colonels
and
two
majors
had
fled
out
of
lisbon
and
joined
the
french
they
were
all
men
who
had
quarrelled
with
beresford
and
deserted
in
revenge
but
that
four
field
officers
could
turn
traitors
at
once
was
a
most
distressing
sign
wellington
had
fears
of
a
general
plot
against
the
english
and
was
inclined
to
suspect
the
bishop
of
oporto
and
president
sousa
of
knowing
more
about
it
than
befitted
members
of
the
regency
he
was
apparently
mistaken
though
their
petulance
and
intermittent
protests
against
all
his
actions
seemed
to
him
to
justify
any
doubts
but
minor
persons
in
lisbon
old
friends
of
alorna
and
his
francophil
policy
had
contrived
to
open
up
communication
with
the
renegade
general
pamplona
and
to
send
him
newspapers
reports
of
the
movement
of
troops
and
other
miscellaneous
information
using
as
their
intermediaries
smugglers
who
passed
the
lines
at
night
to
sell
coffee
sugar
and
other
luxuries
to
the
french
for
there
was
a
ready
market
for
such
things
in
the
army
of
masséna
fortunately
this
illicit
correspondence
was
of
little
importance
since
there
was
no
solid
party
in
portugal
in
favour
of
napoleon
and
the
information
conveyed
by
newspapers
as
to
affairs
in
lisbon
was
not
at
this
time
at
all
encouraging
to
the
french
while
that
as
to
events
in
england
or
remote
parts
of
spain
was
too
old
in
date
to
be
of
any
great
profit
to
them
their
names
san
miguel
loulé
candido
xavier
and
manuel
de
castro
are
given
by
fririon
masséna
s
in
his
diary
major
leslie
tells
me
that
he
can
not
identify
them
in
the
portuguese
of
and
thinks
that
two
of
them
at
least
were
only
ordenança
officers
for
details
as
to
all
this
see
wellington
to
charles
stuart
february
vii
meanwhile
wellington
regarded
his
position
as
secure
for
the
moment
the
army
of
portugal
even
after
drouet
s
arrival
was
too
weak
to
attack
him
soult
s
movement
from
andalusia
at
first
caused
him
some
uneasiness
for
he
had
conceived
a
notion
that
the
expedition
from
andalusia
leaving
badajoz
and
elvas
on
its
left
and
ignoring
the
spanish
army
of
estremadura
might
be
intending
to
march
by
merida
and
truxillo
to
almaraz
and
from
thence
to
join
masséna
by
the
circuitous
route
through
coria
and
castello
branco
he
was
reassured
as
to
this
possibility
when
the
news
came
that
soult
unable
to
undertake
anything
bold
so
long
as
gazan
had
not
joined
him
had
sat
down
to
besiege
olivenza
on
january
if
the
marshal
intended
to
take
all
the
estremaduran
fortresses
before
moving
on
occupation
could
be
found
for
him
for
many
a
week
and
when
la
romana
s
two
divisions
had
been
sent
to
join
mendizabal
on
january
wellington
imagined
that
he
might
regard
the
situation
on
this
side
as
secure
it
will
be
remembered
that
he
gave
mendizabal
elaborate
advice
as
to
the
course
that
he
was
to
pursue
and
he
was
justified
in
believing
that
if
that
advice
was
followed
badajoz
would
never
fall
and
soult
for
the
moment
would
become
an
almost
negligible
quantity
this
fear
is
expressed
in
a
letter
to
charles
stuart
dated
january
vii
on
the
news
that
mortier
s
cavalry
had
seized
the
bridge
of
merida
the
passage
of
the
tagus
by
mortier
removes
to
a
distant
period
the
danger
of
alemtejo
but
it
shows
that
we
may
be
attacked
at
an
early
period
in
our
positions
for
mortier
supposing
him
to
march
by
almaraz
can
be
on
the
zezere
in
the
first
days
of
february
and
i
think
it
possible
that
the
battle
for
the
possession
of
this
country
and
probably
the
fate
of
the
peninsula
will
be
fought
in
less
than
a
month
from
this
there
was
always
the
chance
however
that
soult
might
turn
against
the
alemtejo
after
all
and
that
masséna
might
make
a
desperate
effort
to
cross
the
tagus
and
join
him
hence
wellington
spent
much
thought
in
devising
means
to
prevent
this
danger
from
coming
into
being
beresford
received
elaborate
orders
as
to
the
conduct
that
he
was
to
pursue
with
his
corps
south
of
the
tagus
in
case
masséna
attempted
a
passage
or
soult
appeared
before
elvas
in
the
latter
case
the
french
would
be
fought
by
an
army
composed
of
mendizabal
s
estremadurans
beresford
s
corps
and
the
brigade
of
portuguese
line
troops
in
elvas
a
mass
of
over
men
this
force
ought
to
suffice
but
if
the
worst
came
and
a
defeat
were
suffered
the
army
south
of
the
tagus
would
try
to
defend
first
the
passages
of
the
zatas
river
or
the
benevente
river
as
wellington
usually
calls
it
then
those
of
the
almansor
and
lastly
the
line
across
the
neck
of
the
setubal
peninsula
opposite
lisbon
where
there
was
a
short
front
of
ten
miles
from
setubal
itself
which
was
fortified
past
the
castle
of
palmella
to
moita
on
the
tagus
estuary
but
behind
this
again
was
the
strongest
defensive
position
of
all
a
lines
of
torres
vedras
on
a
small
scale
the
works
erected
here
were
an
afterthought
they
had
formed
no
part
of
the
original
scheme
for
the
fortification
of
lisbon
but
when
it
had
been
proved
to
wellington
that
batteries
on
the
heights
of
almada
beyond
the
broad
tagus
mouth
might
incommode
the
shipping
in
the
harbour
and
possibly
the
town
itself
the
range
was
yards
he
had
ordered
early
in
december
that
the
portuguese
labourers
set
free
from
work
on
the
old
lines
by
masséna
s
departure
should
be
transferred
to
the
almada
front
here
a
line
of
yards
from
sea
to
sea
was
marked
out
and
strengthened
with
no
less
than
seventeen
closed
redoubts
connected
by
a
covered
way
guns
were
allotted
to
them
and
their
defence
was
to
be
given
over
to
the
marines
of
the
fleet
and
the
local
militia
and
trained
ordenança
of
lisbon
it
was
calculated
that
beresford
would
find
a
garrison
of
men
already
placed
in
these
forts
if
he
were
ever
forced
back
on
to
them
it
seemed
impossible
that
such
a
short
front
so
strongly
held
could
ever
be
broken
through
all
this
may
be
found
in
wellington
s
dispatch
of
january
where
he
details
the
successive
positions
which
beresford
must
try
to
hold
for
a
description
of
this
front
see
jones
of
torres
pp
but
all
this
was
a
precaution
designed
to
face
a
very
unlikely
if
a
possible
situation
of
affairs
it
was
much
more
probable
that
masséna
would
try
to
pass
the
tagus
higher
up
than
that
soult
would
fight
his
way
to
its
mouth
across
the
alemtejo
and
every
precaution
was
taken
to
give
masséna
a
hot
reception
if
he
should
make
the
attempt
it
was
clear
that
his
for
such
an
enterprise
must
be
punhete
and
the
mouth
of
the
zezere
for
there
were
collected
the
ninety
boats
and
the
materials
for
the
floating
bridges
which
had
been
created
by
the
energy
of
general
eblé
at
santarem
the
other
place
where
masséna
had
boats
the
stock
of
them
was
known
to
be
too
small
for
a
passage
in
force
beresford
it
will
be
remembered
had
already
established
batteries
which
commanded
the
mouth
of
the
zezere
and
had
several
times
stopped
small
explorations
by
the
french
boats
only
on
one
occasion
did
a
few
succeed
in
running
past
on
the
whole
it
was
considered
unlikely
that
masséna
would
attempt
such
a
serious
matter
as
the
crossing
of
the
tagus
opposite
punhete
d
urban
beresford
s
chief
of
the
staff
reported
it
is
altogether
improbable
that
he
will
commit
himself
unless
in
combination
with
the
army
arriving
from
the
south
the
stream
is
very
rapid
the
boats
can
not
return
to
the
original
point
of
embarkation
for
a
second
load
of
men
nor
to
the
second
point
for
a
third
load
but
must
cross
at
each
time
to
a
point
lower
down
owing
to
the
current
this
must
and
will
occasion
great
disunion
and
scattering
among
the
parts
of
the
division
who
first
pass
all
the
more
because
they
will
be
vigorously
opposed
from
the
beginning
it
appears
to
me
that
no
attempt
of
the
kind
can
succeed
the
alone
is
their
d
and
leaves
little
else
for
us
to
watch
hence
arises
for
them
a
difficulty
of
accomplishing
this
enterprise
that
would
appear
almost
it
is
most
interesting
to
compare
this
judgement
from
the
english
side
with
the
discussion
of
the
problem
by
the
french
generals
which
followed
a
few
days
later
and
with
which
we
shall
presently
have
to
deal
from
a
long
note
by
d
urban
in
his
unpublished
diary
dated
january
see
pp
meanwhile
both
parties
were
decidedly
nervous
as
to
the
possible
movements
of
their
adversaries
if
wellington
sometimes
thought
that
masséna
might
make
an
attempt
to
cross
the
tagus
masséna
was
very
reasonably
suspicious
that
wellington
might
make
a
upon
junot
s
corps
along
the
upper
rio
mayor
and
try
to
cut
it
off
before
it
could
be
succoured
by
ney
from
thomar
and
golegão
this
suspicion
led
to
the
only
skirmish
that
marked
the
month
of
january
on
the
the
marshal
ordered
junot
to
make
a
reconnaissance
in
force
beyond
the
river
along
the
alcoentre
road
to
see
whether
a
rumour
that
an
english
division
had
been
brought
up
behind
pack
s
portuguese
outposts
were
true
the
duke
of
abrantes
conducted
the
affair
himself
at
the
head
of
infantry
of
clausel
s
division
and
horse
he
pressed
in
the
cavalry
screen
in
front
of
pack
consisting
of
a
squadron
of
the
hussars
of
the
king
s
german
legion
and
occupied
the
village
of
rio
mayor
from
which
he
drove
out
two
portuguese
companies
discovering
nothing
in
reserve
save
pack
s
brigade
drawn
up
for
resistance
on
the
heights
to
the
rear
and
noting
no
battalions
the
french
withdrew
after
a
little
skirmishing
and
returned
to
their
lines
during
this
trifling
affair
junot
received
a
painful
but
not
dangerous
wound
from
the
carbine
of
a
hussar
vedette
the
ball
struck
him
on
the
side
of
the
nose
broke
the
bone
there
and
lodged
in
his
cheek
but
it
was
extracted
with
no
difficulty
and
he
was
able
to
resume
command
of
his
corps
within
a
few
days
nothing
further
occurred
on
this
front
till
february
when
the
english
cavalry
paid
a
return
visit
to
the
french
outlying
picket
east
of
the
rio
mayor
drove
it
in
and
retired
with
an
officer
and
ten
men
prisoners
the
best
account
of
this
reconnaissance
is
in
the
journal
of
sprünglin
pp
on
february
the
third
and
final
period
of
masséna
s
stay
on
the
tagus
may
be
said
to
have
begun
with
the
arrival
of
the
last
orders
from
paris
which
he
was
destined
to
receive
he
had
been
more
than
a
month
without
any
official
intelligence
of
what
was
going
on
behind
him
the
latest
dispatches
to
hand
having
been
those
brought
by
drouet
at
the
end
of
the
old
year
but
general
foy
now
appeared
with
the
orders
which
the
emperor
had
issued
on
december
he
had
cut
his
way
from
ciudad
rodrigo
across
the
eastern
mountains
and
along
the
estrada
nova
at
the
head
of
a
column
of
men
mostly
composed
of
drafts
belonging
to
the
corps
which
he
had
found
waiting
on
the
spanish
frontier
the
rains
had
been
continuous
the
badness
of
the
road
was
notorious
and
colonel
grant
with
a
small
party
of
local
ordenança
hung
about
the
route
of
the
column
for
the
last
five
days
of
its
march
and
slew
or
captured
more
than
a
hundred
stragglers
the
total
loss
by
fatigue
and
sickness
was
much
greater
there
is
a
good
account
of
this
march
by
foy
in
his
ed
girod
de
l
ain
pp
the
orders
brought
by
foy
were
not
particularly
comforting
to
masséna
he
was
bidden
to
hold
on
to
his
position
till
he
had
received
succour
from
the
army
of
the
south
and
also
from
the
army
of
the
centre
mortier
s
corps
as
he
had
already
been
assured
would
at
some
date
make
its
appearance
on
the
tagus
in
the
direction
of
montalvão
and
villaflor
a
column
from
the
army
of
the
centre
was
to
advance
to
plasencia
and
communicate
with
the
marshal
via
coria
and
castello
branco
he
was
not
expected
to
take
the
offensive
till
he
should
have
received
these
reinforcements
but
he
must
use
drouet
s
troops
to
keep
open
communications
with
almeida
and
regularize
the
war
there
was
no
order
for
him
to
cross
the
tagus
into
the
alemtejo
in
search
of
mortier
it
was
mortier
who
was
to
come
to
him
practically
all
this
amounted
to
a
command
to
wait
and
endure
the
initiative
was
to
come
from
outside
with
the
arrival
of
reinforcements
from
the
south
and
east
l
empereur
appelait
son
armée
à
une
lutte
de
fatigue
et
de
persévérance
as
foy
commented
but
this
strife
of
toil
and
perseverance
had
already
been
going
on
since
november
the
dispatch
was
days
old
when
it
reached
masséna
and
the
by
the
armies
of
the
south
and
centre
which
it
promised
showed
no
signs
of
coming
to
pass
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
foy
arrived
mortier
s
divisions
were
absorbed
in
the
siege
of
badajoz
and
soult
with
mendizabal
upon
his
hands
could
have
moved
neither
a
detachment
nor
the
whole
corps
to
the
tagus
the
promised
assistance
from
the
army
of
the
centre
a
mere
column
of
men
under
lahoussaye
had
advanced
first
to
truxillo
and
then
to
plasencia
as
was
promised
but
had
turned
back
for
want
of
provisions
long
before
reaching
the
portuguese
frontier
masséna
pushed
several
reconnaissances
towards
the
upper
tagus
in
the
hope
of
getting
information
as
to
the
appearance
of
friendly
troops
on
either
side
of
the
river
but
could
learn
nothing
he
says
that
he
judged
from
the
tranquillity
shown
by
the
english
south
of
the
tagus
that
there
could
be
no
french
force
near
enough
to
cause
them
disquietude
meanwhile
the
power
of
the
army
of
portugal
to
live
by
plundering
the
was
being
reduced
every
day
the
distance
at
which
food
had
to
be
sought
was
ever
increasing
and
the
loss
suffered
by
the
parties
which
were
cut
off
while
raiding
was
growing
daily
more
serious
the
number
of
prisoners
taken
by
the
british
cavalry
on
junot
s
flank
and
drouet
s
front
amounted
to
several
hundreds
in
january
and
february
many
more
were
destroyed
by
the
ordenança
who
were
goaded
to
ferocious
activity
by
the
cruelty
of
the
marauders
and
dogged
every
expedition
that
set
out
with
an
skill
they
avoided
the
main
bodies
but
trapped
and
shot
small
parties
that
strayed
more
than
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
column
with
patient
persistence
for
details
of
this
see
the
diary
of
tomkinson
of
the
light
dragoons
his
own
regiment
alone
brought
in
prisoners
between
january
and
february
there
were
some
very
fine
feats
of
arms
on
a
small
scale
in
this
outpost
fighting
notably
a
capture
made
by
lieutenant
bishop
on
january
when
with
six
men
he
charged
twenty
chasseurs
and
took
eight
with
twelve
horses
after
waiting
for
a
fortnight
after
the
arrival
of
foy
and
the
imperial
dispatches
and
learning
nothing
of
any
approach
of
the
troops
of
mortier
masséna
assembled
the
corps
leaders
and
certain
other
generals
at
golegão
on
february
at
a
meeting
which
he
carefully
refrained
from
calling
a
council
of
war
that
he
should
do
so
was
in
itself
a
sign
of
flagging
confidence
he
had
shown
himself
very
autocratic
hitherto
and
had
asked
the
advice
of
none
of
his
lieutenants
now
he
regarded
the
situation
as
so
desperate
that
he
thought
that
he
must
either
give
up
the
game
and
retreat
from
the
tagus
or
risk
an
attack
on
the
allied
forces
south
of
that
river
with
the
object
of
crossing
into
the
alemtejo
and
going
off
to
join
soult
his
own
mind
was
practically
made
up
in
favour
of
the
former
alternative
but
he
knew
that
if
he
took
it
without
consulting
his
lieutenants
they
would
probably
report
him
to
the
emperor
as
having
despaired
before
all
was
lost
the
council
of
war
was
really
called
for
the
purpose
of
arguing
them
down
and
committing
them
to
the
policy
of
retreat
so
that
they
should
not
be
able
to
protest
against
it
at
a
later
date
the
best
account
of
this
council
of
war
is
foy
s
in
his
pp
which
is
contemporary
it
differs
largely
from
koch
s
narrative
in
his
de
it
is
quite
convincing
when
compared
with
masséna
s
explanatory
dispatch
to
berthier
of
march
which
sets
forth
his
own
arguments
for
the
retreat
they
are
the
same
which
foy
attributes
to
him
in
the
précis
of
the
meeting
of
february
the
three
came
to
the
meeting
each
with
a
scheme
of
his
own
to
develop
ney
proposed
to
pass
the
tagus
by
force
with
the
whole
army
to
abandon
portugal
for
the
moment
and
to
join
soult
the
united
armies
should
establish
themselves
on
the
guadiana
complete
the
conquest
of
estremadura
and
then
after
calling
in
all
possible
reinforcements
take
in
hand
the
invasion
of
the
alemtejo
and
an
attack
on
lisbon
from
the
south
junot
hotly
combated
this
scheme
to
pass
into
the
alemtejo
meant
the
surrender
of
all
portugal
to
wellington
who
would
chase
the
corps
out
of
the
beira
it
would
be
giving
up
the
whole
he
wished
to
establish
a
on
the
other
side
of
the
tagus
but
not
to
send
the
whole
army
across
merely
to
occupy
it
with
a
strong
detachment
and
then
to
wait
for
mortier
s
promised
appearance
reynier
s
scheme
was
a
variant
of
junot
s
but
infinitely
more
dangerous
for
he
was
a
general
of
capacity
he
would
throw
one
corps
across
the
tagus
to
scour
the
alemtejo
for
provisions
and
to
try
to
find
mortier
the
other
two
should
hold
on
at
santarem
in
the
entrenched
positions
which
had
already
checked
wellington
for
three
months
the
english
general
he
said
was
timid
and
would
never
dare
to
assault
these
formidable
works
even
in
the
absence
of
of
the
army
masséna
had
no
difficulty
in
demolishing
this
last
proposal
the
passage
of
the
tagus
would
be
a
dangerous
and
difficult
operation
in
face
of
an
enemy
who
was
upon
the
alert
who
had
fortified
all
the
obvious
on
the
opposite
bank
and
who
was
known
to
have
established
a
perfect
system
of
signals
and
communications
it
might
very
probably
end
in
a
bloody
repulse
but
granting
that
it
succeeded
and
that
a
corps
of
men
got
over
into
the
alemtejo
victory
would
have
consequences
more
disastrous
than
failure
for
wellington
would
fall
upon
the
two
corps
left
north
of
the
tagus
with
his
main
force
perhaps
men
and
when
separated
from
the
troops
detached
in
the
alemtejo
the
army
of
portugal
would
have
only
in
line
n
pas
à
craindre
que
cette
portion
de
l
armée
séparée
de
l
autre
ne
soit
attaquée
battue
détruite
par
un
ennemi
à
qui
pour
nous
faire
beaucoup
de
mal
il
ne
manque
que
de
le
vouloir
this
was
absolutely
irrefutable
logic
nothing
could
be
more
insane
than
reynier
s
proposal
to
separate
the
french
army
into
two
parts
by
the
broad
stream
of
the
tagus
wellington
could
have
destroyed
with
ease
the
of
it
left
north
of
the
river
unless
that
portion
should
be
ready
to
evacuate
all
else
that
it
held
and
shut
itself
up
to
be
besieged
in
santarem
the
only
possible
centre
of
resistance
but
to
be
shut
up
in
santarem
meant
starvation
on
a
worse
scale
than
had
been
hitherto
endured
for
the
army
losing
its
old
broad
would
be
compelled
to
live
entirely
upon
what
might
be
sent
it
from
the
northern
alemtejo
by
the
detached
corps
and
that
region
was
known
to
be
barren
and
thinly
peopled
and
had
probably
already
been
stripped
of
its
resources
by
wellington
s
orders
as
a
matter
of
fact
such
orders
had
been
issued
some
time
back
pour
un
intérêt
si
modique
que
celui
de
manger
un
mois
dans
l
alemtejo
risquer
une
pareille
opération
asked
the
marshal
and
any
dispassionate
judge
must
decide
that
his
question
could
only
be
answered
in
the
negative
ney
s
proposal
to
take
the
whole
army
across
the
tagus
into
the
alemtejo
was
not
quite
so
easy
to
dispose
of
but
there
stood
against
its
first
necessary
preliminary
the
passage
of
the
river
the
same
objections
that
were
registered
against
reynier
s
plan
the
passage
might
end
in
a
repulse
and
the
position
of
the
army
would
be
very
bad
if
having
concentrated
at
punhete
or
at
santarem
for
the
crossing
it
found
itself
encircled
by
all
wellington
s
forces
which
would
march
in
upon
it
the
moment
that
ney
s
and
junot
s
corps
were
withdrawn
from
their
present
cantonments
the
marshal
disliked
the
idea
of
having
to
fight
a
battle
with
the
tagus
at
his
back
and
all
his
possible
lines
of
retreat
intercepted
or
again
the
crossing
might
succeed
so
far
as
the
throwing
of
a
vanguard
across
to
the
alemtejo
bank
went
but
wellington
would
close
in
upon
the
army
while
it
was
actually
passing
and
might
easily
destroy
its
rearguard
or
even
its
larger
half
by
attacking
when
the
rest
was
across
the
water
and
unable
to
return
with
sufficient
promptness
bientôt
viendrait
le
moment
où
on
serait
forcé
de
se
jeter
sur
l
une
ou
sur
l
autre
rive
et
alors
on
pourrait
trouver
les
entourées
par
une
contrevallation
de

l

verrait
forcée
à
recevoir

avec
un
fleuve
au
dos
en
voulant
se
porter
sur
la
rive
masséna
to
berthier
march
if
the
army
were
so
lucky
as
to
get
off
entire
into
the
barren
alemtejo
and
to
unite
with
the
corps
on
the
guadiana
wellington
as
junot
had
pointed
out
would
have
a
free
hand
in
northern
and
central
portugal
and
would
sweep
claparéde
out
of
it
while
he
need
not
be
seriously
alarmed
at
any
attack
on
lisbon
from
the
south
of
the
tagus
for
the
city
was
covered
by
the
almada
lines
and
could
not
be
harassed
from
this
quarter
meanwhile
the
army
of
portugal
would
be
cut
off
from
all
the
supplies
and
reinforcements
which
were
accumulating
for
it
on
the
frontier
of
spain
at
ciudad
rodrigo
and
salamanca
it
would
be
going
off
to
a
distance
from
its
real
line
of
operations
and
of
it
is
interesting
to
see
from
masséna
s
dispatch
of
march
that
he
was
aware
of
the
existence
both
of
the
setubal
and
the
almada
fortifications
masséna
then
came
to
the
point
having
argued
down
the
schemes
of
reynier
and
ney
he
developed
his
own
determination
which
was
to
hold
on
for
the
few
days
more
that
seemed
possible
the
marauding
operations
that
fed
the
army
were
rapidly
growing
less
productive
and
the
moment
was
approaching
when
the
daily
plunder
would
no
longer
meet
the
daily
consumption
and
then
in
case
the
soult
did
not
appear
the
army
must
retire
on
to
the
line
of
the
mondego
there
in
a
country
comparatively
undamaged
masséna
hoped
to
hold
out
some
fifty
or
sixty
days
at
the
least
the
whole
corps
would
be
available
for
opening
and
maintaining
the
communications
with
almeida
and
ciudad
rodrigo
and
reinforcements
and
stores
would
easily
be
brought
forward
but
no
further
offensive
movements
could
be
contemplated
the
army
was
exhausted
and
needed
a
long
rest
in
the
end
it
would
probably
have
to
retire
within
the
borders
of
spain
perhaps
to
alcantara
on
the
tagus
perhaps

this
comes
from
masséna
s
dispatch
to
berthier
of
march
ney
and
reynier
seem
to
have
retired
from
the
conference
rather
talked
down
than
convinced
and
the
latter
sent
in
to
his
a
sort
of
protest
taking
the
form
of
a
précis
of
the
meeting
in
which
the
arguments
used
and
the
result
arrived
at
were
so
misrepresented
that
masséna
caused
a
formal
document
to
be
drawn
up
and
signed
by
five
other
generals
present
at
the
council
in
which
it
was
declared
that
the
précis
was
wholly
incorrect
apparently
reynier
had
intended
to
get
his
protest
to
the
emperor
s
hands
in
order
to
free
himself
from
any
responsibility
in
approving
a
retreat
which
he
thought
that
his
master
would
condemn
for
details
as
to
this
see
foy
s
narrative
quoted
above
the
few
weeks
for
which
the
army
of
portugal
retained
its
position
after
the
conference
at
golegão
were
spent
by
all
its
units
as
a
mere
period
of
preparation
for
the
retreat
for
the
generals
had
long
made
up
their
minds
that
soult
would
never
appear
on
the
tagus
they
seem
even
to
have
thought
that
he
might
have
retired
from
estremadura
for
the
distant
thunder
of
the
bombardment
of
badajoz
which
had
been
audible
at
punhete
during
the
first
half
of
february
seemed
to
have
ceased
this
must
have
been
due
to
some
change
of
atmospheric
conditions
for
it
was
going
on
with
redoubled
energy
in
the
last
days
of
the
month
but
masséna
and
his
lieutenants
argued
that
either
the
siege
had
been
raised
or
else
soult
had
taken
the
place
and
yet
was
not
marching
to
the
tagus
they
seem
to
have
regarded
his
doings
as
a
negligible
quantity
when
coming
to
their
final
resolve
during
the
last
days
of
february
all
the
corps
received
preliminary
orders
which
could
have
no
other
meaning
than
that
a
retreat
had
been
decided
upon
the
divisions
were
ordered
to
send
their
parks
and
heavy
baggage
to
the
rear
and
the
divisional
batteries
were
told
to
complete
as
many
with
good
serviceable
horses
as
was
possible
by
destroying
caissons
and
drafting
their
animals
on
to
the
guns
in
some
cases
batteries
had
to
be
reduced
to
three
or
four
pieces
even
when
half
the
caissons
had
been
burnt
the
corps
destroyed
caissons
on
the
february
yet
still
could
find
only
four
horses
each
for
those
remaining
including
animals
that
were
sick
or
barely
fit
for
service
but
the
transport
of
food
was
even
more
important
than
that
of
artillery
material
in
the
central
magazines
there
was
gathered
together
some
fifteen
days
of
biscuit
for
the
whole
army
the
flour
for
which
had
been
procured
with
the
greatest
difficulty
in
small
quantities
and
had
been
hoarded
to
the
last
this
was
issued
to
the
regiments
with
stringent
orders
not
to
use
it
till
the
actual
retreat
began
some
units
were
so
pressed
by
starvation
that
they
began
to
consume
it
and
ultimately
started
with
only
eight
or
ten
days
consumption
in
their
packs
or
on
their
waggons
the
whole
of
the
transport
was
in
a
deplorable
state
if
the
cavalry
and
artillery
had
lost
horses
since
november
the
train
had
been
depleted
of
in
a
still
greater
proportion
since
they
were
both
weaker
to
start
with
and
less
carefully
kept
some
regiments
had
no
longer
any
horses
attached
to
them
and
could
only
show
a
few
and
asses
quite
insufficient
for
carrying
their
reserve
ammunition
and
food
two
things
were
certain
the
one
that
if
the
army
could
not
pick
up
provisions
on
the
way
by
marauding
it
would
ultimately
have
to
retire
to
its
base
within
the
frontiers
of
spain
and
no
food
could
be
collected
for
some
days
since
the
first
five
stages
of
the
retreat
would
be
through
a
region
already
stripped
bare
the
second
was
that
the
ammunition
might
suffice
for
one
general
engagement
supposing
that
there
was
heavy
fighting
during
the
retreat
but
that
it
would
hardly
be
able
to
serve

orders
which
marked

next
day

continued

evacuated

of

s
divisions

massed
itself
at
pernes
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
other
clausel
which
was
to
hold
the
outposts
till
the
last
moment
this
was
the
critical
day
of
the
concentration
for
of
the
eight
divisions
forming
the
army
of
portugal
five
had
started
off
leaving
three
heudelet
at
santarem
clausel
on
the
rio
mayor
loison
at
punhete
to
hold
the
old
positions
if
wellington
had
attacked
in
force
on
the
it
seems
certain
that
he
must
have
destroyed
these
covering
forces
which
in
their
scattered
position
could
not
possibly
have
held
their
ground
but
the
british
general
as
we
shall
see
was
engaged
in
a
scheme
of
his
own
and
did
not
at
first
detect
the
full
meaning
of
the
french
movements
for
wellington
at
this
moment
was
busy
in
developing
an
encircling
attack
on
the
whole
of
the
french
positions
and
it
was
not
yet
ready
on
february
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
strike
the
moment
that
a
large
body
of
reinforcements
already
overdue
from
england
and
the
mediterranean
should
have
arrived
the
plan
was
that
the
main
army
while
holding
reynier
in
check
at
santarem
with
one
or
two
divisions
should
attack
junot
on
the
rio
mayor
with
the
bulk
of
its
force
at
the
same
time
beresford
drawing
his
corps
to
the
north
of
the
tagus
by
the
at
abrantes
was
to
fall
upon
loison
at
punhete
and
as
it
was
hoped
thus
distract
ney
whose
duty
would
be
divided
between
the
succouring
of
junot
and
that
of
the
division
on
the
zezere
but
even
if
he
turned
most
of
the
reserves
in
the
direction
of
the
rio
mayor
the
long
distance
would
prevent
them
from
arriving
in
time
junot
would
almost
certainly
be
overwhelmed
by
superior
numbers
while
reynier
was
being
contained
and
while
ney
s
columns
were
still
far
off
this
plan
comes
out
in
full
in
the
diary
of
beresford
s
chief
of
the
staff
d
urban
writes
under
the
february
the
marshal
tells
me
that
lord
wellington
means
to
attack
and
his
beresford
s
own
share
is
that
he
must
turn
and
force
the
french
left
when
the
reinforcements
should
arrive
some
of
them
are
already
on
their
march
up
from
lisbon
on
their
arrival
lord
wellington
will
attack
the
french
right
on
the
rio
mayor
while
marshal
beresford
crosses
the
tagus
at
abrantes
and
attacks
the
force
on
the
zezere
at
the
same
time
orders
to
inquire
how
far
in
attacking
the
corps
at
punhete
amoreira
can
be
turned
and
the
heights
of
montalvão
gained
with
consequent
advantage
of
ground
in
coming
on
the
enemy
upon
the
the
local
reports
were
prepared
by
d
urban
on
the
the
only
allusion
to
the
plan
in
the
wellington
dispatches
is
in
the
last
paragraph
of
the
letter
to
lord
liverpool
of
february
in
which
the
phrase
occurs
i
can
not
venture
to
detach
troops
to
estremadura
even
after
the
reinforcements
shall
arrive
and
if
the
weather
should
hold
up
a
little
i
must
try
something
greater
extent
but
more
doubtful
preparations
and
reconnaissances
in
view
of
this
great
attack
began
to
be
made
but
the
reinforcements
were
slow
to
arrive
six
thousand
men
were
due
mainly
the
troops
which
afterwards
formed
the
division
and
the
second
british
brigade
of
the
but
on
march
only
the
from
cadiz
and
half
of
the
had
yet
landed
of
the
other
expected
regiments
the
bulk
turned
up
in
lisbon
harbour
on
the
march
viz
the
but
the
light
infantry
brigade
of
the
king
s
german
legion
did
not
come
in
till
the
of
the
same
month
it
was
undoubtedly
the
accidental
delay
of
a
few
days
in
the
arrival
of
these
seven
battalions
that
caused
wellington
to
hold
back
if
masséna
had
postponed
his
move
for
a
week
more
all
would
have
been
in
line
save
the
two
belated
german
battalions
and
the
attack
would
have
been
delivered
about
the
of
march
the
had
landed
very
early
in
february
and
a
wing
of
the
on
the
of
that
month
but
the
bulk
of
the
transport
fleet
from
england
only
was
reported
at
the
tagus
mouth
on
march
and
began
to
land
men
next
day
the
critical
day
of
masséna
s
retreat
the
ships
with
the
german
light
brigade
had
sailed
late
and
came
in
even
later
in
proportion
set
on
the
carrying
out
of
his
own
plan
which
could
not
begin
to
work
for
a
few
days
more
wellington
was
evidently
not
fully
prepared
for
the
suddenness
of
masséna
s
retreat
on
the
of
march
the
day
when
ney
s
corps
began
to
file
to
the
rear
he
wrote
to
beresford
i
think
it
likely
that
the
enemy
is
about
some
move
but
have
been
so
frequently
disappointed
that
it
is
impossible
to
be
certain
there
is
no
alteration
whatever
in
their
this
was
true
for
junot
and
reynier
had
not
moved
on
a
man
upon
the
on
the
next
the
critical
day
he
himself
made
a
survey
of
reynier
s
lines
in
front
of
santarem
found
them
still
manned
by
heudelet
s
division
but
thought
that
he
could
detect
that
the
artillery
in
the
french
works
was
less
numerous
than
on
the
previous
day
there
were
no
howitzers
in
the
great
work
across
the
high
road
but
only
what
appeared
to
be
pieces
of
small
calibre
he
could
not
perceive
guns
any
longer
upon
the
main
heights
in
front
of
santarem
bushes
seemed
to
have
been
laid
to
cover
the
stations
which
they
had
occupied
but
the
outposts
were
the
same
and
he
did
not
observe
any
other
change
on
the
heights
excepting
that
all
the
troops
visible
upon
them
were
fully
accoutred
he
concluded
that
no
general
movement
of
reynier
s
corps
had
taken
place
it
is
probable
that
baggage
and
heavy
artillery
may
have
been
sent
off
but
the
effective
part
of
the
army
still
remains
in
there
was
no
obvious
alteration
visible
along
junot
s
front
where
clausel
was
that
day
holding
all
the
outposts
solignac
having
marched
back
to
pernes
if
wellington
had
attacked
at
once
that
day
with
the
troops
that
were
up
in
his
front
line
the
light
division
and
the
division
in
front
of
santarem
while
demonstrating
with
pack
s
portuguese
and
the
cavalry
brigades
along
the
rio
mayor
to
detain
clausel
it
is
probable
that
he
might
have
made
great
havoc
of
heudelet
s
division
which
was
holding
a
front
too
long
for
its
strength
and
had
no
supports
since
the
rest
of
the
corps
was
a
march
to
the
rear
by
now
but
he
was
still
thinking
of
his
own
plan
the
fleet
with
the
bulk
of
the
expected
battalions
was
reported
at
the
mouth
of
the
tagus
and
one
regiment
had
actually
landed
wherefore
he
wrote
to
beresford
the
reinforcements
have
arrived
and
we
shall
be
able
in
a
few
days
to
attack
the
enemy
if
he
retains
this
position
or
possibly
to
attack
him
in
any
other
which
he
may
take
meanwhile
the
rear
divisions
of
the
army
were
ordered
to
close
in
on
the
evening
of
march
cole
division
was
brought
up
to
cartaxo
while
campbell
division
moved
out
from
the
old
lines
to
azambuja
which
cole
had
left
the
division
was
ordered
up
from
alcoentre
to
join
pack
s
portuguese
on
the
rio
mayor
beresford
was
directed
to
bring
the
division
across
the
tagus
at
abrantes
and
to
attack
the
french
on
the
zezere
loison
s
division
the
moment
that
he
saw
any
signs
of
their
being
about
to
move
off
most
of
these
orders
will
be
found
in
the
early
dispatch
of
march
to
beresford
the
rest
are
mentioned
as
having
been
ordered
to
take
place
on
the
in
the
dispatch
to
beresford
of
the
but
all
this
was
too
late
the
only
chance
of
destroying
masséna
s
rearguard
would
have
been
to
have
attacked
on
the
morning
of
the
with
the
troops
that
were
already
on
the
spot
and
this
wellington
would
not
do
because
he
thought
that
reynier
and
junot
were
still
in
position
with
the
effective
part
of
the
on
the
following
morning
it
was
too
late
heudelet
had
evacuated
santarem
and
clausel
the
line
of
the
rio
mayor
after
dusk
and
each
having
made
a
long
the
one
was
at
ponte
de
almonda
near
golegão
the
other
near
torres
novas
before
noon
on
the
heudelet
had
blown
up
the
bridge
of
alviella
clausel
that
of
pernes
to
detain
the
pursuers
the
enemy
had
gained
a
full
march
upon
the
british
in
this
direction
on
the
other
flank
beresford
brought
the
division
over
the
tagus
on
the
but
finding
that
loison
had
made
no
movement
had
not
attacked
him
his
orders
being
to
fall
on
only
when
he
saw
the
enemy
break
up
from
his
positions
on
the
early
morning
of
the
same
day
wellington
had
found
that
santarem
was
empty
and
occupied
it
the
light
division
and
pack
were
sent
in
pursuit
of
junot
and
reached
pernes
the
division
followed
reynier
and
had
the
head
of
its
column
at
the
broken
bridge
of
the
alviella
by
the
afternoon
the
and
divisions
coming
up
from
the
rear
entered
santarem
while
the
division
reached
the
line
of
the
rio
mayor
and
followed
the
light
division
the
division
and
campbell
s
portuguese
were
still
far
to
the
rear
on
this
day
wellington
made
up
his
mind
from
the
signs
before
him
that
masséna
was
in
full
march
for
coimbra
and
the
north
and
did
not
intend
to
fight
a
battle
the
only
puzzling
sign
was
that
loison
s
division
still
remained
stationary
on
the
zezere
was
it
even
now
possible
that
the
other
corps
were
going
to
join
him
for
an
attack
on
abrantes
an
attempt
to
cross
the
tagus
near
it
or
a
retreat
into
spain
via
the
castello
branco
road
this
was
not
likely
for
if
such
had
been
masséna
s
plan
ney
would
have
arrived
to
join
loison
already
and
they
would
have
commenced
their
movement
beyond
the
zezere
wellington
however
did
not
feel
quite
certain
as
to
what
was
the
french
scheme
till
loison
burnt
his
boats
and
bridges
on
the
night
of
the
and
moved
off
towards
thomar
in
the
same
direction
as
the
rest
of
the
french
army
it
is
clear
that
if
beresford
had
been
ordered
to
fall
upon
loison
in
force
upon
the
afternoon
of
the
he
might
have
done
him
much
harm
for
there
lay
upon
the
zezere
only
a
single
french
infantry
division
and
a
cavalry
brigade
while
beresford
had
at
abrantes
beside
the
garrison
an
english
and
a
portuguese
division
of
infantry
and

at

leaving
his

blazing
behind
him
as
a
beacon
for
beresford

benefit
it
was
clear
that
the
french
were
all
making
for
the

and
had
no
designs
west
of
the

the
english
cavalry
following
on
the
heels
of
both
reynier
s
and
junot
s
columns
informed
wellington
that
the
enemy
was
apparently
about
to
use
both
roads
towards
the
mondego
that
by
leiria
and
pombal
and
that
by

and
ancião
the
british
general
expressed
some
surprise
at
this
remarking
in
a
letter
to
beresford
that
the
latter
road
was
so
bad
that
he
marvelled
that
everything
had
not
gone
by
the
infinitely
superior
leiria
chaussée
the
main
road
to
the
north
meanwhile
of
his
own
troops
beresford
had
crossed

did
not
reach

on
from

advanced
to

on

the
and
divisions
reached
golegão
in
the
afternoon
but
hearing
of
ney
s
and
drouet
s
concentration
at
leiria
and
doubtful
whether
he
would
not
find
that
the
rest
of
the
enemy
was
about
to
take
shelter
behind
them
wellington
resolved
not
to
push
any
more
troops
in
the
thomar
direction
but
to
keep
a
large
mass
upon
the
road
the
bulk
of
the
division
all
save
nightingale
s
brigade
and
the
division
were
halted
at
alcanhede
and
pernes
and
thither
too
the
division
and
the
portuguese
brigades
from
the
rear
were
directed
it
must
be
confessed
that
this
was
not
a
very
rapid
or
vigorous
pursuit
wellington
was
waiting
on
the
enemy
s
movements
rather
than
forcing
them
to
take
such
directions
as
best
suited
himself
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
he
had
been
compelled
to
advance
ere
yet
his
own
preparations
were
made
four
or
five
days
before
he
had
intended
to
make
his
great
concentric
attack
and
two
factors
were
against
him
the
first
was
the
eternal
the
divisions
had
marched
unexpectedly
with
such
supplies
as
they
had
in
hand
they
were
unable
to
get
anything
from
the
country
which
the
french
had
stripped
bare
during
the
last
three
months
the
rations
for
them
were
being
brought
up
from
the
rear
but
if
they
outmarched
them
they
must
starve
hence
there
were
reasons
against
hurry
the
second
cause
of
delay
was
that
wellington
wished
to
have
his
whole
army
in
hand
if
the
enemy
should
turn
and
show
fight
and
the
divisions
which
had
started
from
the
torres
vedras
lines
on
the
first
notice
of
masséna
s
departure
on
the
were
still
far
to
the
rear
viz
the
and
the
portuguese
battalions
which
had
once
been
le
cor
s
and
was
now
under
campbell
the
new
division
which
had
just
landed
had
not
yet
commenced
its
march
from
lisbon
wellington
to
beresford
vii
the
aspect
of
the
region
through
which
the
army
was
marching
was
piteous
in
the
extreme
santarem
town
was
a
wreck
the
houses
torn
and
dilapidated
the
streets
strewn
with
household
furniture
and
destroyed
many
streets
quite
impassable
with
filth
and
rubbish
with
an
occasional
man
horse
or
donkey
rotting
and
corrupting
the
air
with
pestilential
vapours
a
few
miserable
inhabitants
like
living
skeletons
the
was
worse
cottages
burnt
and
unroofed
and
corpses
of
murdered
peasants
some
fresh
some
mere
heaps
of
bones
lying
in
every
ravine
the
survivors
were
just
emerging
from
woods
or
caverns
to
cut
up
the
french
sick
and
stragglers
a
single
quotation
may
suffice
to
give
some
idea
of
the
wayside
sights
of
this
distressing
march
it
comes
from
a
division
chronicler
who
is
describing
the
village
of
porto
de
mos
south
of
leiria
when
we
entered
the
place
there
was
a
large
convent
fronting
us
which
as
well
as
many
of
the
houses
had
been
set
on
fire
by
the
french
i
never
before
witnessed
such
destruction
floors
torn
up
beds
cut
in
pieces
their
contents
thrown
about
intermixed
with
kitchen
utensils
broken
mirrors
china
there
was
a
large
fire
in
the
chapel
on
which
had
been
heaped
broken
pieces
of
the
altar
wooden
images
picture
frames
and
the
ornamental
woodwork
of
the
organ
searching
for
a
clean
place
to
put
down
bags
of
biscuit
we
found
a
door
leading
to
a
chamber
apart
from
the
chapel
it
was
quite
dark
so
i
took
up
a
burning
piece
of
wood
to
inspect
it
it
was
full
of
human
bodies
some
lying
others
kneeling
or
leaning
against
the
walls
the
floor
was
covered
with
ashes
in
many
places
still
such
an
appalling
sight
i
have
never
witnessed
of
those
who
had
sunk
on
the
floor
nothing
remained
but
bones
those
who
were
in
a
kneeling
or
standing
posture
were
only
partially
consumed
the
expression
of
their
scorched
faces
was
horrible
beyond
description
in
a
bag
lying
at
the
upper
end
of
the
apartment
was
the
dead
body
of
a
young
child
who
had
been
strangled
the
cord
used
was
still
tight
about
its
little
neck

of

simmons
of
the
from
the
memoirs
of
donaldson
of
the
passing
through
porto
de
mos
on
september
i
thought
that
i
would
try
to
discover
whether
any
memory
of
this
horrid
tragedy
survived
the
sacristan
of
whom
i
made
inquiries
at
once
took
me
to
a
ruined
chamber
to
the
left
of
the
church
and
told
me
that
people
had
been
burned
there
in
the
time
of
the
a
new
sacristy
had
been
built
to
replace
it
in
the
chamber
being
held
accursed
it
was
on
the
morning
that
followed
his
arrival
at
torres
novas
march
that
wellington
encouraged
by
the
reports
of
his
cavalry
scouts
to
the
effect
that
the
french
were
marching
day
and
night
and
showed
no
wish
to
fight
issued
the
orders
already
alluded
to
in
a
previous
chapter
which
bade
beresford
turn
back
the
division
and
march
with
it
and
the
to
the
relief
of
badajoz
the
report
of
menacho
s
death
and
of
the
rapid
advance
of
the
french
had
just
reached
him
beresford
was
to
take
with
him
hamilton
s
portuguese
division
which
had
not
yet
passed
the
tagus
and
de
grey
s
cavalry
brigade
the
at
abrantes
was
floated
down
to
tancos
near
punhete
in
order
to
save
the
and
divisions
some
miles
of
march
in
their
journey
to
the
alemtejo
these
troops
turned
back
and
were
nearing
tancos
on
the
following
day
when
they
received
orders
to
halt
the
french
so
the
advanced
cavalry
reported
after
marching
hitherto
day
and
night
had
come
to
a
stand
at
pombal
north
of
leiria
where
ney
junot
and
drouet
were
now
all
massed
though
reynier
was
said
to
have
taken
another
road
that
by
espinhal
wellington
was
not
sure
that
masséna
did
not
intend
to
fight
and
if
so
he
wished
to
have
the
division
with
him
and
de
grey
s
heavy
dragoons
in
this
case
it
is
desirable
he
writes
that
i
should
be
a
little
stronger
and
as
badajoz
is
not
yet
pressed
i
have
sent
to
cole
to
desire
that
his
division
and
the
dragoons
march
for
cacharia
i
shall
then
be
as
strong
as
the
enemy
or
very
the
division
was
to
halt
and
wait
further
orders
it
was
not
till
the
that
it
was
let
loose
and
told
to
resume
its
march
to
the
alemtejo
cole
and
de
grey
were
not
sent
back
from
the
main
army
till
the
meanwhile
badajoz
as
we
have
already
seen
fell
by
imaz
s
pusillanimity
on
march
a
date
too
early
for
beresford
to
have
saved
it
even
if
he
had
continued
the
march
originally
prescribed
to
him
on
the
of
that
month
see
chapter
ii
above
and

wellington
sent
on
their
southward
journey
the
three
divisions
which
were
to
form
the
future

of
estremadura
stirring
events
had
begun
to
occur
on

and
the

course
of

had
already
been
settled
section
xxiii
chapter
iv
events
in
the
south
of
spain
the
battle
of
barrosa
in
the
second
chapter
of
this
volume
we
dealt
with
soult
s
expedition
to
estremadura
and
its
results
but
had
to
defer
for
later
consideration
the
events
which
brought
him
back
in
haste
to
andalusia
the
moment
that
badajoz
had
fallen
march
these
must
now
be
explained
when
his
men
collected
from
all
the
three
corps
which
formed
the
army
of
the
south
set
out
on
the
last
day
of
the
old
year
soult
left
behind
him
three
problems
each
of
which
as
he
was
well
aware
might
assume
a
dangerous
aspect
at
any
moment
we
have
already
indicated
their
character
would
victor
with
men
left
to
him
for
the
blockade
of
cadiz
be
able
to
hold
with
security
the
immense
semicircle
of
lines
and
batteries
which
threatened
the
island
stronghold
of
the
cortes
would
the
provisional
garrison
which
had
been
patched
up
for
seville
prove
strong
enough
to
defend
that
capital
and
its
arsenals
against
any
possible
attack
of
roving
spanish
detachments
from
the
mountains
of
the
west
and
south
would
sebastiani
and
the
corps
be
able
to
beat
back
any
attempt
by
the
army
of
murcia
to
trespass
upon
the
limits
of
the
broad
and
rugged
province
of
granada
we
may
add
that
it
was
conceivable
that
all
these
three
problems
might
demand
a
simultaneous
solution
for
if
all
the
spanish
forces
had
been
guided
by
a
single
capable
brain
nothing
would
have
been
more
obvious
to
conceive
than
a
plan
for
setting
them
all
to
work
at
once
if
a
sortie
from
cadiz
were
taken
in
hand
it
would
have
the
best
chance
of
success
supposing
that
sebastiani
were
to
be
distracted
by
an
invasion
of
granada
and
seville
threatened
by
any
force
that
could
be
collected
in
the
condado
de
niebla
or
the
mountains
above
ronda
see
pp
above
soult
as
napoleon
pointed
out
to
him
two
months
later
had
committed
a
considerable
fault
by
not
putting
all
the
divisions
left
behind
in
andalusia
under
a
single
commander
responsible
for
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
alike
victor
was
given
no
authority
over
sebastiani
nor
even
over
daricau
who
had
been
left
as
governor
of
seville
or
godinot
whose
depleted
division
occupied
the
province
of
cordova
napoleon
always
suspicious
of
soult
accused
him
of
having
neglected
this
precaution
because
he
was
jealous
of
victor
and
would
not
make
him
as
great
as
himself
whether
this
was
so
or
not
it
is
at
any
rate
clear
that
the
position
was
made
much
more
dangerous
by
the
fact
that
each
of
the
three
problems
named
above
would
be
presented
to
a
different
commander
who
would
be
prone
to
think
of
his
own
troubles
alone
and
to
neglect
those
of
his
colleagues
if
all
three
dangers
became
threatening
at
the
same
moment
each
general
would
regard
his
own
as
the
most
important
and
bestow
comparatively
little
care
on
those
which
menaced
the
others
as
a
matter
of
fact
victor
was
almost
destroyed
because
sebastiani
did
not
come
to
his
help
when
the
sally
from
cadiz
took
place
early
in
march
and
seville
was
in
serious
danger
a
few
days
later
because
there
was
no
one
who
could
order
godinot
to
march
to
its
aid
from
cordova
without
delay
no

ne
fût
aussi
grand
que
foy
s
interview
with
napoleon
in
his
soult
was
fully
aware
of
all
the
possible
perils
of
his
absence
apparently
he
thought
sebastiani
was
in
the
greater
danger
for
he
requisitioned
only
a
few
cavalry
and
artillery
from
the
corps
and
left
it
practically
intact
to
defend
the
province
of
granada
against
the
army
of
murcia
as
to
seville
he
considered
that
it
could
only
be
endangered
by
ballasteros
and
for
that
reason
did
his
best
to
destroy
that
general
s
division
by
causing
gazan
to
hunt
it
as
far
as
the
borders
of
portugal
a
diversion
which
nearly
wrecked
the
estremaduran
expedition
for
lack
of
infantry
when
gazan
had
driven
ballasteros
over
the
guadiana
after
the
action
of
castillejos
january
the
marshal
thought
that
the
spaniard
was
out
of
the
game
and
no
longer
in
a
position
to
do
harm
in
which
he
erred
for
this
irrepressible
enemy
was
back
in
andalusia
within
a
few
weeks
and
was
actually
threatening
seville
early
in
march
see
above
but
the
greatest
danger
was
really
on
the
side
of
cadiz
where
victor
deprived
of
nearly
all
his
cavalry
and
one
regiment
of
infantry
for
the
estremaduran
expedition
had
also
to
furnish
outlying
detachments
a
garrison
for
xeres
and
the
column
with
which
general
remond
was
operating
in
the
condado
de
niebla
far
to
the
west
he
had
only
men
left
for
the
defence
of
the
lines
of
which
a
considerable
proportion
consisted
of
artillery
sappers
and
marine
troops
needed
for
the
siege
but
useless
for
a
fight
in
the
open
if
the
enemy
should
make
a
sally
by
sea
against
his
rear
the
duke
of
belluno
was
anxious
and
rightly
so
for
the
nearest
possible
succours
were
sebastiani
s
troops
in
granada
and
malaga
many
marches
away
while
the
garrison
of
cadiz
was
very
strong
and
indeed
outnumbered
his
own
force
at
the
beginning
of
february
it
comprised
including
the
urban
militia
nearly
spanish
troops
copons
had
just
been
withdrawn
from
the
west
to
join
it
there
was
also
an
division
general
graham
had
been
left
a
considerable
force
even
after
wellington
withdrew
certain
regiments
to
join
in
the
defence
of
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
he
had
two
composite
battalions
of
the
guards
the
a
half
battalion
of
the
the
two
battalions
of
the
portuguese
and
a
provisional
battalion
of
german
recruits
as
also
two
squadrons
of
the
hussars
of
the
king
s
german
legion
and
two
field
batteries
the
whole
amounted
to
between
and
men
it
is
curious
to
note
that
napoleon
in
the
dispatch
by
which
he
spurred
soult
on
to
his
estremaduran
expedition
assured
him
that
there
had
never
been
more
than
three
english
regiments
at
cadiz
and
that
they
had
all
gone
to
lisbon
so
that
the
isle
of
leon
and
city
were
only
defended
by
ten
thousand
unhappy
spaniards
without
resolution
or
power
to
resist
when
the
emperor
s
directions
were
based
upon
information
so
utterly
incorrect
as
this
it
was
hard
for
his
generals
to
satisfy
him
see
above
whom
wellington
in
his
dispatch
to
graham
of
december
calls
the
german
deserters
they
having
been
mainly
men
who
had
absconded
from
the
french
armies
no
within
a
few
days
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
detachment
taken
by
soult
from
victor
the
news
came
to
cadiz
that
the
corps
had
been
weakened
and
when
the
destination
of
the
expedition
was
known
it
seemed
probable
that
no
reserves
had
been
left
at
seville
on
which
the
besieging
force
could
count
the
idea
of
an
attack
on
victor
was
at
once
broached
by
the
regency
and
accepted
by
general
graham
after
some
discussion
it
was
considered
best
not
to
assail
the
lines
by
a
disembarkation
from
the
isle
of
leon
but
to
land
as
large
a
force
as
could
be
spared
in
the
rear
of
the
enemy
at
tarifa
algesiras
or
some
other
point
of
southern
andalusia
which
was
in
the
hands
of
the
allies
such
a
movement
if
properly
conducted
would
compel
victor
to
draw
backward
in
order
to
hold
off
the
allies
from
the
lines
he
would
have
to
fight
at
some
distance
inland
leaving
a
minimum
garrison
to
protect
his
forts
and
batteries
and
it
was
proposed
that
the
fleet
and
the
troops
left
in
cadiz
should
fall
upon
them
during
his
enforced
absence
the
execution
of
this
plan
was
deferred
for
some
weeks
partly
because
of
the
difficulty
of
providing
transport
by
sea
for
a
large
expeditionary
force
partly
because
gazan
was
unexpectedly
drawn
back
into
andalusia
by
ballasteros
s
division
and
was
at
the
end
of
january
in
a
position
from
which
he
might
easily
have
reinforced
victor
when
he
had
gone
off
to
estremadura
in
the
wake
of
soult
the
problem
became
simpler
after
drawing
back
copons
s
division
from
the
condado
de
niebla
to
cadiz
as
has
already
been
mentioned
the
regency
found
themselves
able
to
provide
men
for
embarkation
while
leaving
regulars
and
the
urban
militia
to
hold
cadiz
graham
was
ready
to
join
in
with
all
his
troops
save
the
battalion
companies
of
the
and
the
portuguese
and
the
doubtfully
effective
german
battalion
which
were
to
remain
behind
for
he
did
not
wish
to
withdraw
the
whole
british
force
from
cadiz
at
once
but
he
procured
the
aid
of
an
almost
equivalent
number
of
bayonets
from
an
external
source
he
wrote
to
general
campbell
commanding
at
gibraltar
begging
him
to
spare
reinforcements
from
the
garrison
of
that
fortress
and
of
the
minor
stronghold
of
tarifa
at
the
extreme
southern
point
of
europe
which
was
then
maintained
as
a
sort
of
dependency
of
gibraltar
campbell
eagerly
consented
to
take
part
in
the
plan
and
promised
to
lend
infantry
this
assistance
would
bring
up
the
british
contingent
to
men
the
spaniards
were
also
to
collect
some
small
reinforcements
there
was
an
irregular
force
under
general
beguines
operating
in
the
ronda
mountains
and
basing
itself
on
gibraltar
it
was
ordered
to
join
the
expedition
when
it
should
come
to
land
and
as
we
shall
see
actually
did
so
with
a
force
of
three
battalions
or
men
the
total
of
the
troops
whom
it
was
proposed
to
collect
amounted
therefore
to
spaniards
and
british
a
force
almost
equal
in
numbers
to
victor
s
depleted
corps
but
it
was
clear
that
the
marshal
would
have
to
leave
some
sort
of
a
garrison
in
the
lines
before
cadiz
and
that
the
allies
would
have
a
numerical
superiority
if
they
could
force
on
a
fight
at
a
distance
from
the
sea
and
the
french
base
one
cardinal
mistake
was
made
in
planning
the
expedition
its
command
was
to
be
entrusted
to
general
manuel
la
peña
then
the
senior
officer
in
cadiz
a
man
with
a
talent
for
plausible
talking
and
diplomacy
but
one
who
had
already
shown
himself
a
selfish
colleague
and
a
disloyal
subordinate
this
was
the
same
man
who
in
nearly
three
years
back
had
sacrificed
his
chief
castaños
at
the
disastrous
battle
of
tudela
by
refusing
to
march
to
the
sound
of
the
guns
and
securing
a
safe
retreat
for
himself
and
his
men
while
the
main
army
was
being
crushed
only
four
miles
away
by
marshal
lannes
though
not
personally
a
coward
he
was
a
shirker
of
responsibilities
and
incapable
of
a
swift
and
heroic
decision
he
was
ambitious
enough
to
aspire
to
and
intrigue
for
a
post
of
importance
but
collapsed
when
it
became
necessary
to
discharge
its
duties
he
treated
graham
in
precisely
as
he
had
treated
castaños
in
and
it
was
not
his
fault
that
the
sally
from
cadiz
failed
to
end
in
a
disaster
the
english
had
discretionary
authority
from
his
government
to
refuse
to
act
in
any
joint
expedition
of
which
he
was
not
given
the
command
but
anxious
to
bring
matters
to
a
head
and
deceived
by
la
peña
s
mild
plausibility
he
consented
to
take
the
second
place
on
the
ground
that
the
spaniard
contributed
the
larger
body
of
troops
to
the
enterprise
see
vol
pp
schepeler
the
prussian
officer
in
spanish
service
whose
notes
on
all
the
cadiz
affairs
are
so
important
owing
to
his
having
served
through
them
under
blake
and
la
peña
says
that
the
latter
was
generally
allowed
to
be
incompetent
he
was
a
regular
old
woman
he
tells
an
illustrative
anecdote
of
a
guerrillero
chief
who
came
to
concert
a
bold
plan
with
the
general
and
went
away
at
once
saying
can
i
hope
to
get
anything
out
of
an
officer
who
as
i
find
is
called
donna
manuela
by
every
one
about
him
schepeler
der
spanischen
i
la
peña
had
kept
his
place
despite
of
his
tudela
fiasco
through
family
and
intrigues
he
is
said
to
have
been
the
tame
cat
of
certain
great
ladies
of
the
patriotic
party
if
graham
himself
had
headed
the
united
force
it
is
certain
that
the
siege
of
cadiz
would
have
been
raised
for
the
moment
though
what
would
have
followed
that
success
no
man
can
say
for
it
would
have
brought
about
such
a
convulsion
in
andalusia
and
such
a
concentration
of
the
french
troops
that
the
whole
of
the
conditions
of
the
war
in
the
south
would
have
been
altered
graham
had
all
the
qualities
which
la
peña
lacked
indomitable
resolution
swift
decision
a
good
eye
for
topography
the
power
of
inspiring
enthusiastic
confidence
in
his
troops
he
was
no
mere
professional
soldier
but
a
crusader
with
a
mission
indeed
his
personal
history
is
one
of
extraordinary
interest
when
the
french
revolution
broke
out
he
was
a
civilian
of
mature
years
a
whig
member
of
parliament
aged
mainly
known
as
a
great
sportsman
and
a
bold
rider
yet
certainly
if
the
war
of
had
not
come
to
pass
he
would
only
be
remembered
now
as
the
husband
of
that
beautiful
graham
whose
portrait
is
one
of
gainsborough
s
masterpieces
he
played
in
the
first
recorded
cricket
match
in
scotland
in
illustration
thomas
driven
to
the
riviera
in
by
the
failing
health
of
his
wife
who
died
at
hyères
graham
was
an
of
the
outbreak
of
violence
and
blind
rage
in
france
which
followed
brunswick
s
invasion
he
himself
was
arrested
his
wife
s
coffin
was
torn
open
by
a
mob
which
insisted
that
he
was
smuggling
arms
for
aristocrats
therein
he
narrowly
escaped
with
his
life
and
returned
to
england
convinced
that
the
french
had
become
a
nation
of
wild
beasts
humani
i
had
once
deprecated
he
wrote
at
the
time
the
hostile
interference
of
britain
in
the
internal
affairs
of
france
but
what
i
have
seen
in
my
journey
through
that
country
makes
me
consider
that
war
with
her
has
become
just
and
necessary
in
of
our
constitution
widowed
and
childless
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
go
to
the
front
at
once
despite
of
his
years
and
his
lack
of
military
training
he
devoted
all
his
available
funds
to
the
raising
in
his
own
county
of
the
foot
the
perthshire
volunteers
of
which
he
became
the
honorary
colonel
he
could
not
take
command
of
the
corps
because
he
had
no
substantive
military
rank
but
he
could
not
keep
at
home
he
went
out
to
the
mediterranean
as
a
sort
of
volunteer
to
lord
mulgrave
and
afterwards
being
found
useful
owing
to
his
gift
of
languages
he
knew
not
only
italian
but
german
a
rare
accomplishment
in
those
days
he
was
entrusted
with
a
special
mission
to
the
austrian
army
of
italy
he
served
through
all
the
disasters
of
beaulieu
and
würmser
starved
in
mantua
and
froze
in
the
tyrolese
alps
see
his
diary
quoted
in
delavoye
s
of
lord
from
that
time
onward
we
find
him
wherever
there
was
fighting
against
the
french
to
be
done
in
sicily
minorca
malta
egypt
portugal
so
great
were
his
services
that
contrary
to
all
war
office
rules
his
honorary
colonelship
was
changed
to
a
regular
commission
on
the
staff
and
in
he
served
first
as
the
british
attaché
with
castaños
s
army
and
later
as
one
of
sir
john
moore
s
in
reward
for
brilliant
service
in
the
corunna
campaign
he
was
given
in
the
command
of
the
british
force
at
cadiz
and
so
it
came
about
that
this
whig
member
of
parliament
who
had
commenced
soldiering
at
like
oliver
cromwell
and
julius
caesar
was
at
leading
a
british
division
in
the
field
he
had
an
iron
frame
and
his
spirit
was
as
firm
as
his
body
the
crusade
had
to
be
fought
out
to
the
end
though
the
enemy
was
now
the
corsican
tyrant
not
the
atheist
republic
against
which
he
had
first
drawn
his
sword
it
was
in
keeping
with
all
his
previous
career
that
he
consented
to
take
the
second
place
in
the
tarifa
expedition
to
get
the
army
started
was
essential
his
personal
position
counted
for
nothing
with
him
before
a
month
was
out
he
had
good
reason
to
regret
that
he
had
been
so
graham
survived
barrosa
for
thirty
years
lived
to
be
and
after
waterloo
founded
the
united
service
club
as
a
place
of
rendezvous
for
his
old
peninsular
comrades
who
looked
upon
him
as
a
kind
of
father
after
many
tiresome
delays
the
english
contingent
sailed
from
cadiz
on
february
but
met
with
such
fierce
west
winds
when
it
neared
cape
trafalgar
that
the
convoy
could
not
make
the
difficult
harbour
of
tarifa
and
was
blown
past
it
into
gibraltar
bay
where
graham
landed
on
the
at
algesiras
here
he
found
waiting
for
him
a
flank
battalion
of
bayonets
which
general
campbell
had
made
up
for
him
out
of
the
six
flank
companies
of
the
and
from
algesiras
the
troops
marched
on
the
to
tarifa
where
they
picked
up
another
reinforcement
provided
by
campbell
the
eight
battalion
companies
of
the
which
had
been
doing
garrison
duty
in
that
little
fortress
men
in
all
having
now
just
men
graham
divided
the
infantry
into
two
brigades
the
first
under
general
dilkes
numbered
bayonets
it
was
composed
of
the
two
composite
battalions
of
the
guards
together
with
the
flank
battalion
from
gibraltar
and
two
companies
of
the
rifles
the
second
brigade
under
colonel
wheatley
had
bayonets
and
consisted
of
the
and
another
flank
battalion
under
colonel
barnard
composed
of
the
two
light
companies
of
the
portuguese
the
only
troops
of
that
nation
which
served
in
the
expedition
those
of
the
with
four
more
companies
of
the
rifles
there
were
only
cavalry
two
squadrons
of
the
hussars
of
the
king
s
german
legion
and
ten
guns
under
major
duncan
the
delays
in
the
start
caused
an
unexpected
conjunction
in
the
mountains
of
the
south
beguines
and
his
roving
brigade
warned
to
be
ready
to
join
in
the
campaign
by
the
came
down
from
the
ronda
mountains
in
search
of
the
army
advanced
as
far
as
medina
sidonia
and
skirmished
there
with
victor
s
flank
guard
two
battalions
under
general
cassagne
which
were
always
kept
watching
the
mountains
march
beaten
off
beguines
retired
to
his
usual
haunts
and
waited
for
signs
of
the
expedition
his
premature
attack
premature
through
no
fault
of
his
own
called
victor
s
attention
to
his
rear
and
caused
him
to
fortify
medina
sidonia
and
to
reinforce
cassagne
with
three
battalions
and
a
cavalry
regiment
the
spanish
contingent
had
sailed
three
days
after
graham
had
met
with
the
same
rough
weather
and
had
been
much
beaten
about
but
the
troops
began
to
arrive
at
tarifa
on
the
and
were
all
ashore
on
the
la
peña
assumed
command
was
all
politeness
and
made
over
to
graham
two
unbrigaded
battalions
of
his
own
to
bring
up
the
force
of
the
two
small
british
brigades
to
a
higher
figure
the
rest
of
his
troops
were
organized
in
two
divisions
under
lardizabal
and
the
prince
of
anglona
the
first
five
the
second
six
battalions
strong
he
had
brought
fourteen
guns
and
four
squadrons
of
horse
under
an
english
colonel
in
the
spanish
service
samuel
whittingham
an
officer
who
did
not
add
to
his
laurels
during
this
expedition
these
battalions
were
i
believe
ciudad
real
and
walloon
guards
as
the
names
of
the
spanish
battalions
engaged
in
this
expedition
have
never
before
been
collected
it
may
be
worth
while
to
mention
here
that
they
were
lardizabal
s
division
campomayor
carmona
murcia
batts
canarias
anglona
s

batts
sigüenza
cantabria

de
valencia
on
arriving
at
the
bridge
of
facinas
and
the
village
of
bolonia
ten
miles
outside
tarifa
la
peña
had
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
he
would
march
against
the
rear
of
the
french
lines
before
cadiz
by
the
track
nearer
to
the
coast
which
passes
through
vejer
de
la
frontera
conil
and
chiclana
or
by
the
inland
road
through
the
mountains
which
runs
past
casas
viejas
to
medina
sidonia
the
two
roads
at
their
bifurcation
are
separated
by
the
long
lagoon
of
la
janda
a
very
shallow
sheet
of
water
seven
miles
long
which
nearly
dries
up
in
summer
but
was
at
this
moment
full
to
overflowing
from
spring
rains
to
take
the
inland
route
across
the
mountains
was
by
far
the
better
course
the
road
was
not
good
but
if
the
allies
could
reach
medina
sidonia
with
their
army
intact
victor
would
be
forced
to
come
out
and
attack
them
at
a
great
distance
from
his
lines
for
it
would
be
practically
impossible
for
the
marshal
to
allow
la
peña
and
graham
to
establish
themselves
at
medina
in
the
rear
of
his
head
quarters
and
backed
by
the
sierra
de
jerez
from
whose
skirts
they
could
send
out
as
many
detachments
as
they
pleased
to
cut
the
communication
between
seville
and
the
lines
there
was
little
danger
of
being
taken
in
the
rear
by
troops
sent
by
the
distant
sebastiani
whose
nearest
forces
were
at
marbella
eighty
miles
away
and
whose
attention
was
at
this
moment
fully
taken
up
by
the
local
guerrilleros
who
had
been
turned
loose
on
him
indeed
sebastiani
for
some
time
thought
that
the
expedition
was
directed
against
himself
and
was
preparing
to
concentrate
and
take
the
defensive
the
only
drawbacks
to
the
medina
sidonia
route
were
there
would
be
no
chance
of
communicating
along
it
with
the
garrison
of
cadiz
and
that
the
question
of
provisions
might
grow
serious
if
the
campaign
were
protracted
for
the
region
was
barren
and
the
army
ill
provided
with
transport
but
a
few
days
would
settle
the
affair
victor
would
be
compelled
to
come
out
at
once
and
fight
with
every
man
that
he
could
bring
and
while
he
was
engaged
at
medina
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
the
spaniards
in
cadiz
from
crossing
the
harbour
and
destroying
the
lines
this
in
itself
even
if
the
allies
failed
to
hold
back
the
marshal
would
have
an
immense
effect
all
over
andalusia
i
do
not
know
these
roads
nor
the
field
of
barrosa
but
colonel
churcher
of
the
royal
irish
fusiliers
who
is
well
acquainted
with
them
tells
me
that
the
track
five
miles
inland
from
the
coast
marked
on
the
british
staff
map
of
from
bolonia
to
vejer
is
no
proper
road
at
all
and
unfit
for
wheeled
traffic
to
this
day
while
the
sidonia
road
is
bad
but
can
carry
vehicles
he
tells
me
that
he
has
actually
crossed
the
laguna
de
la
janda
at
its
centre
in
dry
weather
so
shallow
does
it
become
there
is
a
good
note
on
the
pros
and
cons
of
the
two
routes
in
schepeler
i
la
peña
originally
intended
to
take
the
road
and
ordered
beguines
who
was
now
in
the
high
hills
to
the
east
about
ximena
to
join
him
with
his
roving
brigade
at

had
a
great
and
misplaced
belief
in
night
marches
by
which
he
always
hoped
to
gain
time
on
the
enemy
since
his
moves
could
not
be
discovered
or
reported
till
the
next
morning
he
overlooked
the
corresponding
disadvantage
of
the
extreme
slowness
of
progress
over
bad
roads
in
rugged
country
the
very
real
danger
that
the
troops
or
some
of
them
might
miss
their
way
in
the
dark
and
the
inevitable
fatigue
to
the
men
from
losing
their
proper
hours
of
sleep
graham
s
laconic
diary
shows
how
this
worked
out
marched
in
the
evening
very
tedious
from
filing
across
water
the
stream
which
fills
the
head
of
the
lagoon
of
la
janda
and
other
difficulties
misled
by
the
guides
on
quitting
the
cortigo
de
la
janda
farm
at
the
head
of
the
lagoon
the
made
a
most
fatiguing
night
it
was
twelve
noon
before
the
troops
halted
having
been
nineteen
hours
under
the
troops
of
lardizabal
at
the
head
of
the
column
had
reached
casas
viejas
in
the
morning
but
the
english
division
in
the
rear
of
the
army
had
got
no
further
than
the
northern
end
of
the
lagoon
some
thirteen
miles
from
their
at
puente
de
facinas
there
was
a
violent
east
wind
the
night
had
been
very
cold
and
the
men
were
much
fatigued
lardizabal
on
reaching
casas
viejas
had
found
the
convent
which
was
the
only
solid
building
there
occupied
by
a
french
post
two
companies
sent
out
by
general
cassagne
from
medina
sidonia
to
watch
the
thinking
at
first
that
he
was
only
about
to
be
worried
by
guerrilleros
the
french
captain
shut
himself
up
behind
his
barricades
instead
of
retreating
at
once
when
he
found
out
his
mistake
and
saw
that
a
whole
army
was
about
him
it
was
too
late
to
get
off
without
loss
la
peña
ordered
that
the
convent
should
be
left
alone
as
he
did
not
wish
to
waste
time
in
battering
and
storming
it
the
whole
of
his
troops
had
come
up
including
the
roving
force
of
men
from
the
hills
under
beguines
when
the
french
unwisely
made
a
bolt
eastward
in
the
hope
of
escaping
the
little
column
was
pursued
and
cut
up
by
a
squadron
of
busche
s
german
hussars
many
being
killed
and
captured
from
the
prisoners
and
beguines
s
scouts
la
peña
learnt
that
medina
sidonia
was
contrary
to
his
expectation
held
by
a
serious
force
of
french
cassagne
s
detachment
being
now
composed
of
five
battalions
of
infantry
a
battery
and
a
cavalry
regiment
about
men
the
walls
had
been
repaired
it
was
said
and
the
place
was
in
a
state
of
defence
the
spanish
general
should
have
rejoiced
to
learn
that
victor
had
sent
an
appreciable
part
of
his
army
so
far
afield
fifteen
miles
from
chiclana
and
by
advancing
he
could
have
forced
the
marshal
to
come
to
this
distance
from
his
lines
in
order
to
support
cassagne
a
battle
would
no
doubt
have
followed
but
it
was
for
a
battle
that
the
army
had
sailed
to
tarifa
and
by
drawing
victor
s
whole
fighting
force
so
far
away
from
cadiz
la
peña
would
have
given
a
unique
opportunity
to
the
garrison
to
come
out
and
destroy
the
meanwhile
if
the
french
lost
the
battle
they
would
be
annihilated
being
off
their
line
of
retreat
if
they
won
it
they
would
return
to
find
the
greater
part
of
the
destroyed
but
this
was
not
the
line
of
thought
that
guided
la
peña
he
was
as
his
previous
record
showed
a
shirker
of
responsibilities
and
the
prospect
of
a
battle
on
the
morrow
or
the
day
after
seems
to
have
paralysed
him
to
every
one
s
surprise
he
gave
orders
that
the
army
waiting
till
dusk
had
come
on
should
leave
the
medina
road
and
march
across
country
by
a
bad
to
vejer
on
the
other
route
from
tarifa
to
cadiz
graham
protested
against
a
second
night
march
after
the
experience
of
the
first
and
rightly
for
news
came
in
ere
night
that
the
road
along
the
north
side
of
the
barbate
river
which
la
peña
had
intended
to
use
was
absolutely
under
water
from
inundations
la
peña
therefore
consented
to
wait
till
the
next
morning
march
and
to
use
another
country
road
that
between
the
north
end
of
the
la
janda
lagoon
and
the
river
into
which
it
falls
the
army
marched
at
o
clock
lardizabal
as
before
in
front
the
english
division
in
the
rear
but
on
reaching
the
intended
it
was
found
that
this
road
like
that
north
of
the
river
was
flooded
the
lagoon
having
overflowed
at
its
northern
end
and
joined
itself
in
one
shallow
sheet
of
water
to
the
barbate
graham
on
arriving
at
the
passage
found
the
spaniards
halted
at
the
edge
of
the
flood
and
apparently
at
a
nonplus
the
energetic
old
man
took
the
business
out
of
la
peña
s
hands
he
and
his
staff
rode
into
the
water
and
sought
personally
for
the
track
of
the
submerged
causeway
which
they
fortunately
found
to
be
nowhere
more
than
three
feet
under
the
surface
of
the
flood
he
placed
men
along
the
track
at
intervals
to
guide
those
who
should
follow
and
sat
on
his
horse
in
the
middle
of
the
ford
encouraging
the
troops
as
they
marched
past
him
i
set
the
example
of
going
into
the
water
he
remarks
in
his
diary
which
was
followed
by
lacy
the
prince
of
anglona
and
others
the
passage
lasted
three
hours
and
would
have
taken
double
that
time
but
for
the
exertions
made
to
force
the
men
to
keep
the
files
it
was
o
clock
at
night
before
the
army
reached
vejer
having
taken
fifteen
hours
to
cover
ten
miles
owing
to
the
delays
at
the
inundation
every
one
was
wet
through
and
much
fatigued
for
the
weather
was
still
very
cold
it
remained
to
be
seen
what
the
enemy
would
make
of
this
move
a
squadron
of
french
dragoons
had
been
found
in
vejer
by
the
advanced
guard
and
driven
out
so
that
it
was
certain
that
victor
would
get
prompt
news
that
at
any
rate
some
part
of
the
allied
army
had
now
appeared
on
the
western
road
the
marshal
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
puzzled
on
the
night
of
the
he
had
heard
from
cassagne
that
the
enemy
was
in
force
on
the
medina
sidonia
road
and
had
cut
up
the
post
at
casas
viejas
he
accordingly
sent
orders
to
cassagne
to
bid
him
stand
firm
and
promised
to
support
him
with
his
whole
disposable
force
but
before
dawn
on
the
he
got
news
from
the
dragoons
expelled
from
vejer
that
there
was
a
heavy
force
on
the
western
road
had
la
peña
transferred
himself
from
one
route
to
another
or
were
the
allies
operating
in
two
columns
cassagne
reported
a
little
later
that
the
column
opposed
to
him
had
advanced
no
further
but
that
there
were
still
spanish
troops
on
the
casas
viejas
road
and
this
was
true
for
la
peña
had
left
a
battalion
and
some
guerrilla
horse
at
that
place
to
give
him
news
of
cassagne
if
the
latter
should
move
but
there
was
also
the
garrison
of
cadiz
to
be
watched
and
it
was
showing
signs
of
activity
on
the
night
of
the
when
the
field
army
had
been
lying
at
casas
viejas
general
zayas
had
in
accordance
with
the
scheme
of
times
left
with
him
thrown
his
bridge
of
boats
across
the
santi
petri
creek
and
passed
a
battalion
across
it
which
entrenched
itself
on
the
facing
the
french
works
that
cut
off
the
peninsula
of
the
bermeja
they
threw
up
a
strong
undisturbed
being
under
the
protection
of
the
heavy
guns
in
the
castle
of
santi
petri
and
other
batteries
on
the
isle
of
leon
the
move
could
only
mean
that
the
garrison
of
cadiz
intended
to
come
out
accordingly
victor
resolved
to
stop
its
egress
waiting
for
the
dusk
on
the
night
of
the
he
sent
six
companies
of
picked
to
storm
the
this
they
accomplished
the
heavy
guns
failing
to
stop
them
in
the
dusk
the
spanish
battalion
in
the
work
ordenes
militares
was
nearly
annihilated
losing
officers
and
men
killed
or
taken
but
the
bridge
itself
was
saved
by
the
prompt
sinking
of
two
of
its
boats
and
was
hastily
floated
back
to
the
island
where
zayas
laid
it
up
for
further
use
he
had
been
much
chagrined
at
seeing
and
hearing
nothing
of
allied
forces
behind
the
french
which
he
had
been
told
to
look
for
on
march
according
to
schepeler
la
peña
had
sent
an
officer
out
from
tarifa
in
a
on
the
march
to
let
the
garrison
of
cadiz
know
that
he
might
not
keep
his
time
accurately
this
messenger
was
stopped
at
sea
by
an
english
brig
and
since
he
was
disguised
and
had
no
english
pass
he
was
detained
some
time
as
a
suspicious
character
and
only
reached
cadiz
on
the
putting
together
the
movement
of
zayas
and
the
fact
that
some
at
least
of
the
allied
army
was
now
on
the
vejer
road
the
marshal
came
to
the
correct
conclusion
that
the
army
in
the
field
was
intending
to
get
into
communication
with
cadiz
and
its
garrison
accordingly
he
made
a
new
plan
to
suit
this
hypothesis
of
his
three
divisions
one
that
of
villatte
was
to
block
the
neck
of
the
peninsula
along
which
the
track
from
vejer
and
conil
leads
to
the
santi
petri
creek
and
the
isle
of
leon
the
other
two
concentrated
at
chiclana
were
to
wait
till
the
allied
force
had
found
itself
blocked
in
front
by
villatte
and
then
to
fall
upon
its
flank
in
the
space
of
three
miles
that
lies
between
the
hill
of
barrosa
and
the
position
where
villatte
had
been
posted
this
plan
would
place
the
intercepting
division
in
obvious
danger
since
while
attacked
in
front
by
the
head
of
the
allied
army
it
might
find
zayas
attempting
once
more
to
lay
his
bridge
and
to
take
it
in
the
rear
such
a
movement
by
the
garrison
could
not
be
stopped
because
the
end
of
the
peninsula
by
the
was
under
the
guns
of
several
heavy
batteries
but
victor
directed
villatte
not
to
fight
to
the
last
but
to
be
contented
with
holding
the
allies
in
check
long
enough
to
enable
the
main
body
to
fall
on
their
flank
the
sound
of
his
guns
would
be
the
signal
for
the
two
striking
divisions
to
move
out
from
the
wood
of
chiclana
and
dash
at
the
long
column
whose
head
would
be
engaged
with
villatte
while
its
tail
would
still
be
coming
along
the
coast
many
miles
to
the
rear
for
men
had
only
the
single
line
of
communication
along
which
to
move
illustration
the
barrosa
campaign
meanwhile
cassagne
at
medina
sidonia
was
sent
orders
to
find
out
exactly
what
was
in
front
of
him
and
if
there
was
no
solid
force
to
march
to
join
the
main
body
on
the
morning
of
the
he
must
have
received
the
order
to
do
so
somewhere
in
the
afternoon
of
the
victor
s
force
was
not
so
large
as
he
would
have
wished
soult
had
taken
from
him
six
battalions
of
infantry
and
three
cavalry
regiments
reducing
the
total
of
the
corps
left
at
or
near
cadiz
to
battalions
of
infantry
three
regiments
of
cavalry
and
four
or
five
field
batteries
about
men
in
all
there
were
also
present
in
the
lines
men
more
not
belonging
to
the
corps
viz
about
artillery
and
engineers
and
sappers
belonging
to
the
siege
train
and
marine
troops
from
the
flotilla
which
had
been
constructed
in
cadiz
bay
these
of
course
were
useless
for
field
operations
but
they
served
to
man
the
lines
with
the
addition
of
three
battalions
men
from
the
fighting
force
the
least
that
victor
thought
he
could
spare
for
the
garrison
of
cadiz
and
the
english
fleet
might
attack
in
force
any
point
of
the
lines
during
the
absence
of
the
main
body
this
left
men
available
for
field
operations
but
cassagne
was
still
absent
at
medina
sidonia
with
five
battalions
a
battery
and
one
of
the
three
cavalry
regiments
making
men
in
all
there
were
therefore
only
men
left
to
face
la
peña
and
graham
till
cassagne
should
come
up
victor
according
to
his
own
dispatch
much
the
force
of
the
allies
which
he
states
as
english
and
spaniards
so
that
he
went
to
work
in
rather
a
desperate
mood
thinking
that
he
had
to
fight
very
superior
numbers
and
that
his
only
chance
was
to
make
a
sudden
and
resolute
attack
when
he
was
not
expected
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
overstated
the
enemy
by
nearly
a
half
since
there
were
really
marching
from
vejer
only
english
and
under
spaniards
altogether
and
no
help
could
come
to
them
from
cadiz
till
villatte
should
be
driven
off
each
of
the
three
divisions
which
victor
had
under
his
hand

of
several

a

and
another
detached
with
cassagne
at

the
had
one
in
the
lines
and
three
with
cassagne
hence
they
took
the

ruffin

with
six

each

with

between

right
across

leading
from

and
looking
both
backward
and
forward
with
his
attention
ready
for
zayas
as
much
as
for
la
peña
it
chanced
that
the
battalions
in

division
were

stronger
than
those
in
the
others

against

meanwhile
the
allies
were
marching
straight
into
the
middle
of
the
trap
which
victor
had
prepared
for
them
after
passing
conil
the
road
on
which
their
army
was
moving
turns
inland
towards
chiclana
while
a
mere
track
follows
the
beach
towards
the
santi
petri
it
was
along
this
that
la
peña
was
intending
to
move
but
in
the
dark
the
head
of
the
column
followed
the
main
road
and
went
several
miles
along
it
at
dawn
the
error
was
discovered
and
the
army
cutting
across
an
open
heath
got
down
to
the
beach
see
graham
s
diary
the
point
which
the
allies
had
now
reached
was
a
mile
or
so
of
the
tower
of
barrosa
where
an
isolated
eminence
called
the
cerro
del
puerco
boar
s
hill
crowned
by
a
ruined
chapel
looks
out
upon
the
heathy
plain
of
chiclana
to
the
north
and
a
scrubby
pine
wood
covering
much
of
the
ground
towards
the
beach
to
the
west
the
advanced
cavalry
got
upon
the
hill
unhindered
soon
after
daybreak
and
met
no
enemy
nor
did
patrols
sent
into
the
wood
discover
him
for
some
time
presently
however
news
came
back
from
the
front
that
a
french
force
had
been
discerned
drawn
up
between
the
almanza
creek
and
the
sea
and
blocking
the
way
to
cadiz
being
outside
the
wood
it
was
very
visible
and
seemed
to
be
about
a
strong
brigade
of
infantry
with
a
squadron
or
two
of
horse
this
was
of
course
villatte
waiting
for
the
advance
of
the
allies
no
other
hostile
troops
were
to
be
seen
the
pinewood
is
now
much
shrunken
and
covers
only
the
northern
part
of
its
original
breadth

barrosa
by
colonel
verner
in
the
for
march
la
peña
now
told
graham
that
despite
of
the
fact
that
the
men
had
been
under
arms
for
fourteen
hours
and
had
marched
as
many
miles
in
the
dark
he
was
about
to
thrust
this
french
force
out
of
the
way
without
a
moment
s
delay
lardizabal
with
the
vanguard
division
was
to
attack
it
at
once
while
the
rest
of
the
army
took
up
a
position
to
cover
him
from
any
possible
movement
of
the
enemy
from
the
direction
of
chiclana
about
nine
in
the
morning
lardizabal
with
his
five
battalions
reached
villatte
s
front
deployed
and
attacked
him
the
forces
were
about
equal
and
the
attack
was
repulsed
with
some
loss
la
peña
then
ordered
up
the
leading
brigade
of
anglona
s
division
to
support
the
vanguard
a
sharp
engagement
was
going
on
when
a
new
fire
broke
out
behind
villatte
zayas
from
the
isle
of
leon
had
recast
his
bridge
across
the
santi
petri
and
was
advancing
to
take
the
french
in
the
rear
villatte
saw
his
danger
gave
up
his
position
across
the
peninsula
and
hastily
fell
back
towards
the
passage
of
the
shallow
almanza
creek
near
the
mill
of
the
same
name
he
recrossed
it
not
without
some
difficulty
and
then
drew
up
to
defend
the
passage
lardizabal
was
prevented
by
la
peña
from
pursuing
him
and
halted
opposite
the
skirmish
had
been
hot
villatte
had
lost
men
the
spaniards
a
few
more
but
they
had
achieved
their
purpose
and
the
connexion
with
cadiz
had
been
duly
established
about
noon
la
peña
sent
orders
to
graham
to
evacuate
the
barrosa
position
and
draw
in
closer
to
the
almanza
creek
to
join
the
rest
of
the
army
meanwhile
he
would
be
relieved
on
the
hill
by
five
battalions
of
cruz
murgeon
and
beguines
to
which
rearguard
there
was
added
one
british
battalion
browne
s
composite
unit
consisting
of
the
six
flank
companies
of
the
and
whittingham
and
the
cavalry
were
to
flank
this
force
on
the
coast
track
somewhere
near
the
tower
of
la
barrosa
this
force
was
to
move
off
in
its
turn
when
graham
should
have
reached
the
main
body
for
the
spanish
general
had
resolved
not
to
hold
the
cerro
considering
that
an
army
of
men
should
not
be
spread
out
over
four
miles
of
ground
but
be
kept
more
concentrated
graham
entirely
disagreed
with
this
movement
if
the
allies
came
down
and
crammed
themselves
into
the
narrow
peninsula
between
the
sea
and
the
almanza
creek
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
victor
from
seizing
the
barrosa
heights
and
placing
himself
across
their
front
in
a
way
which
would
block
them
into
the
cramped
position
which
they
had
assumed
the
move
practically
threw
them
back
on
cadiz
and
sacrificed
all
the
results
of
the
toilsome
flank
march
in
which
they
had
been
so
long
engaged
graham
had
in
the
morning
urged
on
la
peña
the
of
retaining
the
hill
but
now
saw
his
advice
rejected
obeying
orders
however
he
set
his
column
in
march
towards
the
torre
bermeja
and
the
almanza
creek
through
the
pine
wood
at
the
same
time
the
rearguard
under
beguines
and
cruz
murgeon
ascended
the
cerro
and
took
up
the
post
which
the
british
division
had
left
cruz
murgeon
was
commanding
the
two
battalions
attached
to
the
british
division
ciudad
real
and
walloon
guards
the
british
column
did
not
descend
to
the
rough
track
along
the
coast
but
used
a
fair
wood
path
right
through
the
middle
of
the
pine
forest
which
saved
them
a
couple
of
miles
of
détour
and
was
practicable
for
artillery
they
were
soon
filing
along
between
the
pines
lost
to
sight
and
themselves
unable
to
see
a
hundred
yards
in
any
direction
at
this
moment
about
victor
suddenly
broke
out
of
the
woods
in
front
of
chiclana
with
the
men
of
ruffin
s
and
leval
s
divisions
he
was
tired
of
waiting
for
cassagne
for
he
had
now
got
news
that
the
force
at
medina
had
started
late
in
the
morning
instead
of
at
dawn
and
would
not
be
up
for
two
or
three
hours
more
his
cavalry
had
just
reported
to
him
that
the
cerro
seemed
to
be
abandoned
and
that
the
troops
formerly
holding
it
were
marching
across
his
front
through
the
forest
since
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
had
been
located
opposite
villatte
on
the
almanza
creek
there
seemed
to
be
a
good
chance
of
seizing
the
important
barrosa
position
unopposed
and
of
striking
the
rear
division
of
the
allies
while
it
was
defiling
strung
out
helplessly
in
a
wood
road
across
the
front
of
the
advancing
french
the
orders
given
by
the
marshal
sent
his
cavalry
regiment
three
squadrons
of
the
dragoons
to
turn
the
heights
by
their
flank
and
seize
the
coast
track
while
ruffin
ascended
the
cerro
by
its
gently
sloping
northern
front
and
leval
struck
at
the
troops
known
to
be
in
the
wood
the
french
being
quite
fresh
came
on
at
a
great
pace
the
marshal
had
explained
to
his
subordinates
that
haste
was
everything
they
were
clearly
visible
to
the
rearguard
left
on
the
heights
partly
visible
to
la
peña
who
could
see
their
flank
up
the
trough
of
the
almanza
creek
but
wholly
invisible
to
graham
and
his
troops
in
the
wood
a
great
responsibility
now
fell
on
the
spanish
officers
on
the
cerro
they
were
under
orders
to
evacuate
the
heights
when
graham
should
have
got
away
westward
what
were
they
to
do
when
it
suddenly
became
clear
that
they
were
themselves
about
to
be
attacked
they
might
attempt
to
defend
the
hill
with
the
one
british
and
five
spanish
battalions
which
lay
unseen
to
the
french
under
the
seaward
slope
of
the
cerro
or
they
might
simply
obey
orders
and
retire
towards
the
main
body
abandoning
their
dominating
position
the
latter
course
was
the
one
taken
the
five
spanish
battalions
streamed
down
the
seaward
face
of
the
hill
in
no
very
good
order
and
fell
in
there
with
the
baggage
of
the
whole
army
all
together
began
to
retire
northward
there
was
a
block
on
the
beach
the
baggage
mules
were
driven
right
and
left
and
many
got
loose
and
bolted
meanwhile
whittingham
with
the
cavalry
three
spanish
and
two
squadrons
ranged
himself
across
the
track
where
he
was
soon
faced
by
the
french
dragoons
who
had
galloped
round
the
face
of
the
heights
with
remarkable
celerity
the
rest
of
the
spanish
cavalry
being
now
with
la
peña
by
the
almanza
creek
whittingham
s
retreat
was
not
made
without
a
protest
against
it
by
colonel
browne
who
urged
firstly
that
it
was
madness
to
abandon
the
height
secondly
that
he
had
graham
s
orders
to
stand
there
and
could
obey
no
others
the
cavalry
general
replied
that
for
his
part
he
had
resolved
to
retire
and
offered
to
lend
browne
one
of
his
squadrons
to
cover
his
retreat
towards
the
british
division
if
he
would
not
follow
him
to
the
coast
track
the
fiery
colonel
made
no
reply
but
turned
to
his
battalion
and
ordered
it
to
occupy
the
ruined
chapel
on
the
top
of
the
cerro
and
the
neighbouring
thickets
and
to
prepare
for
action
but
in
half
an
hour
seeing
whittingham
s
column
far
off
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
six
french
battalions
coming
in
upon
him
browne
gave
way
and
descended
into
the
pine
wood
in
search
of
graham
the
french
ruffin
s
division
took
possession
of
the
heights
and
planted
a
battery
upon
them
there
is
a
lively
account
of
the
altercation
in
the
memoirs
of
browne
s
ardent
admirer
blakeney
boy
in
the
peninsular
meanwhile
we
must
return
to
graham
concealed
in
the
wood
and
marching
as
it
were
blindfold
across
the
front
of
leval
s
approaching
column
he
had
no
cavalry
with
him
but
presently
two
mounted
guerrilleros
rode
up
in
haste
and
told
him
that
the
french
were
close
on
his
flank
riding
back
to
the
rear
of
his
division
he
saw
from
the
edge
of
the
forest
beguines
s
troops
pouring
down
the
near
side
of
the
cerro
and
ruffin
s
mounting
its
northern
ascent
leval
was
also
visible
to
the
left
graham
s
mind
was
made
up
in
a
moment
a
retreat
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
he
writes
who
was
already
in
reach
of
the
easy
communication
by
the
must
have
involved
the
whole
allied
army
in
the
danger
of
being
attacked
during
the
unavoidable
confusion
while
the
different
corps
would
be
arriving
on
the
narrow
ridge
of
bermeja
at
the
same
time
he
saw
that
he
himself
coming
out
of
the
wood
whittingham
and
beguines
from
the
shore
track
and
the
main
body
returning
from
the
almanza
creek
bridge
would
meet
in
disorder
on
the
narrow
neck
of
the
peninsula
by
the
torre
bermeja
and
would
be
unable
to
form
an
orderly
line
of
battle
even
if
they
did
and
then
held
their
ground
the
object
of
the
whole
expedition
was
lost
and
the
french
in
possession
of
the
cerro
del
puerco
once
more
blocked
the
army
into
cadiz
the
alternative
was
to
take
the
offensive
before
the
two
french
columns
had
united
and
to
attack
them
while
they
were
still
coming
upon
the
ground
and
before
they
had
drawn
up
in
any
regular
order
it
was
evident
that
they
were
hurrying
forward
without
any
notion
that
they
were
liable
to
be
thrown
on
the
defensive
at
a
moment
s
notice
in
three
minutes
graham
had
made
up
his
mind
to
attack
himself
instead
of
allowing
himself
to
be
chased
into
the
bermeja
position
the
wood
in
which
his
division
lay
concealed
enabled
him
to
hide
his
movement
though
it
made
that
movement
perilously
disorderly
the
orders
given
were
simple
the
leading
brigade
that
of
colonel
wheatley
was
to
push
straight
through
the
wood
till
it
reached
the
northern
edge
and
then
form
there
and
attack
leval
the
rear
brigade
that
of
general
dilkes
was
to
down
the
on
which
it
was
engaged
till
it
too
cleared
the
wood
and
then
to
form
up
and
attack
ruffin
on
the
slopes
of
the
cerro
del
puerco
the
ten
guns
in
the
centre
of
the
marching
column
were
to
push
up
a
side
track
which
seemed
passable
and
to
form
on
wheatley
s
right
in
the
centre
between
the
two
brigades
meanwhile
these
movements
would
take
some
time
to
execute
and
the
french
were
coming
closer
to
the
wood
every
minute
it
was
necessary
to
hold
them
back
at
all
costs
till
a
line
could
be
formed
with
this
object
graham
resolved
to
throw
forward
on
each
front
a
light
infantry
force
which
should
engage
the
enemy
regardless
of
order
and
of
losses
till
the
main
body
got
up
on
the
left
barnard
s
four
companies
of
the
rifles
and
the
two
companies
of
the
portuguese
under
colonel
bushe
about
men
in
all
were
ordered
to
break
through
the
wood
directly
before
them
without
any
attempt
at
formation
and
when
they
reached
its
edge
to
sally
straight
out
at
leval
s
front
in
the
best
skirmishing
line
they
could
make
on
the
right
there
was
a
force
already
to
the
front
browne
s
flank
battalion
muskets
which
had
just
descended
unwillingly
from
the
cerro
and
was
visible
at
its
foot
this
last
force
was
near
graham
as
he
sat
on
his
horse
among
the
trees
at
the
wood
s
end
he
cantered
up
to
browne
and
asked
him
why
the
cerro
had
been
abandoned
because
five
battalions
of
spaniards
went
off
before
the
enemy
came
within
was
the
reply
well
it
s
a
bad
business
browne
you
must
instantly
turn
round
again
and
the
flank
battalion
began
to
extend
into
skirmishing
order
when
graham
after
a
moment
s
reflection
said
i
must
show
something
more
serious
than
skirmishing
close
the
men
into
compact
battalion
and
then
attack
in
your
front
and
dilkes
s
brigade
was
coming
up
but
was
still
a
mile
away
in
the
wood
and
browne
came
out
of
the
trees
into
the
open
absolutely
isolated
to
attack
uphill
six
battalions
and
a
battery
with
a
line
of
just
men
blakeney
says
that
his
colonel
rode
into
action
singing
the
old
naval
song
now
cheer
up
my
lads
tis
to
glory
we
steer
a
tune
to
which
he
was
much
addicted
at
all
times
in
and
out
of
season
all
this
from
the
graphic
description
in
the
autobiography
of
blakeney
browne
s
adjutant
about
the
same
time
or
a
few
minutes
later
barnard
s
and
bushe
s
scattered
and
uneven
line
burst
out
of
the
northern
edge
of
the
wood
a
mile
away
and
found
themselves
facing
leval
s
division
at
the
distance
of
only
some
yards
this
force
quite
unaware
that
any
enemy
was
yet
near
was
advancing
in
two
columns
each
of
three
battalions
the
right
one
composed
of
the
regiment
and
a
battalion
of
the
left
of
the
regiment
followed
by
a
single
battalion
of
the
their
divisional
battery
was
following
on
their
left
rear
barnard
who
got
a
little
further
to
the
front
than
the
portuguese
was
facing
the
french
bushe
who
was
drawn
back
a
little
in
échelon
was
opposite
the
french
they
had
hardly
opened
their
fire
which
had
great
effect
because
the
enemy
had
no
screen
of
voltigeurs
out
to
cover
him
and
was
caught
unprepared
for
an
infantry
fight
when
duncan
s
ten
guns
which
had
made
extraordinary
good
pace
through
the
wood
appeared
and
unlimbering
at
its
edge
began
to
fire
shrapnel
into
the
leading
battalions
of
the
french
behind
them
the
two
companies
of
the
which
properly
belonged
to
barnard
s
provisional
battalion
took
post
as
their
supports
thus
the
battle
was
suddenly
begun
on
both
fronts
but
graham
had
only
men
up
on
one
side
and
with
the
guns
on
the
other
the
main
body
was
coming
on
through
the
wood
behind
in
an
extraordinarily
mixed
order
when
graham
gave
orders
to
wheatley
s
brigade
to
face
to
their
right
flank
and
push
through
the
wood
northward
and
to
dilkes
s
brigade
to
turn
about
on
the
road
and
return
to
the
cerro
by
the
way
they
had
come
there
was
no
small
confusion
by
some
misunderstanding
the
rear
companies
of
the
which
was
the
last
battalion
in
wheatley
s
brigade
faced
about
and
followed
dilkes
though
the
leading
companies
went
off
with
their
proper
companions
the
and
on
the
other
hand
by
a
compensating
mistake
the
two
companies
of
the
coldstream
guards
which
belonged
to
dilkes
turned
north
into
the
wood
and
followed
wheatley
the
brigades
exchanged
as
it
were
men
with
each
other
in
addition
the
battalions
owing
to
the
sudden
inversion
of
their
column
of
march
were
all
out
of
their
proper
order
in
their
brigades
and
went
into
action
almost
the
biography
of
general
dilkes
seems
to
explain
this
matter
duncan
the
artillery
commander
thought
that
he
would
be
going
into
action
without
any
infantry
supports
and
rode
to
the
nearest
brigadier
this
was
dilkes
to
ask
him
to
lend
a
few
companies
to
cover
the
guns
dilkes
assented
and
told
the
coldstream
companies
in
the
middle
of
his
column
to
fall
out
and
follow
the
guns
but
graham
had
already
set
aside
the
two
companies
of
the
from
barnard
s
battalion
for
the
same
purpose
when
duncan
found
them
waiting
for
him
in
the
edge
of
the
wood
he
told
the
officer
commanding
the
coldstreamers
that
he
was
not
wanted
and
these
two
companies
marched
off
and
fell
into
line
in
a
gap
in
the
front
of
wheatley
s
brigade
but
while
a
line
of
some
sort
was
being
formed
the
screen
of
light
troops
which
graham
had
thrown
forward
to
detain
the
enemy
during
the
deployment
of
the
main
body
had
done
its
duty
by
allowing
itself
to
be
knocked
to
pieces
while
attacking
fivefold
numbers
it
had
to
be
sacrificed
to
gain
time
and
carried
out
its
orders
completely
we
will
take
the
fortunes
of
the
force
first
browne
s
composite
battalion
had
started
from
a
position
close
under
the
edge
of
the
pine
wood
it
had
first
to
cross
a
broad
but
shallow
ravine
and
then
to
climb
the
gentle
slope
of
the
cerro
where
it
became
fully
visible
to
the
enemy
though
there
was
a
little
cover
here
and
there
upon
the
hillside
in
the
form
of
scattered
bushes
and
slight
dips
in
the
ground
the
french
allowed
the
line
to
advance
a
little
way
up
the
ascent
and
then
opened
upon
it
both
with
a
field
battery
placed
close
to
the
chapel
on
the
summit
and
with
the
musketry
fire
of
the
three
battalions
which
formed
their
right
wing
blakeney
our
authority
for
this
side
of
the
battle
says
that
the
first
salvo
of
the
french
knocked
over
more
than
officers
and
men
out
of
forming
the
line
browne
ordered
the
men
to
close
to
the
centre
and
endeavoured
to
continue
his
climb
this
was
done
with
much
difficulty
but
before
the
advance
could
be
resumed
more
than
fifty
men
more
were
killed
or
wounded
all
the
exertions
of
the
colonel
could
not
form
a
third
line
fourteen
officers
out
of
were
down
and
more
than
half
the
rank
and
file
the
remainder
now
scattered
the
men
did
not
retreat
but
threw
themselves
down
and
commenced
independent
firing
from
behind
bushes
hillocks
and
any
other
cover
they
could
find
the
french
made
no
attempt
to
fall
upon
them
by
descending
the
hill
as
would
have
seemed
natural
the
reason
was
that
by
the
time
that
the
flank
battalion
had
been
disposed
of
the
main
body
of
dilkes
s
brigade
had
come
out
of
the
wood
and
was
visible
forming
up
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
to
deliver
the
real
assault
the
guards
had
obtained
the
necessary
time
to
come
up
and
choose
their
ground
through
the
absolute
martyrdom
of
the
flank
battalion
dilkes
did
not
repeat
the
attack
on
the
same
slope
over
which
browne
had
advanced
but
pushed
some
distance
to
the
right
where
the
hillside
showed
more
cover
in
the
way
of
scattered
bushes
and
trees
and
some
dead
ground
hid
the
men
by
its
steepness
from
the
fire
of
the
battery
on
the
crest
above
blakeney
describes
them
as
strung
out
on
a
most
irregular
front
a
confused
mass
rather
than
a
formed
line
the
whole
while
advancing
kept
taking
ground
to
their
right
so
as
to
come
up
the
hillside
opposite
ruffin
s
left
wing
their
extreme
flank
was
covered
by
norcott
s
two
companies
of
rifles
in
more
extended
order
partly
owing
to
the
cover
partly
to
the
difficulty
found
by
the
french
guns
in
getting
their
fire
to
bear
dilkes
s
brigade
got
wellnigh
to
the
top
of
the
hill
before
it
suffered
any
very
serious
losses
but
on
clearing
the
last
underwood
and
reaching
smooth
ground
it
was
charged
by
the
four
battalions
of
ruffin
s
left
two
of
the
line
supported
by
the
two
reserve
battalions
of
this
was
the
crisis
of
the
battle
in
the
southern
half
of
its
progress
by
all
the
rules
of
french
military
art
four
battalion
columns
fresh
and
well
ordered
charging
down
hill
should
have
been
able
to
break
through
a
disordered
line
of
decidedly
inferior
strength
pushing
upwards
against
them
dilkes
had
only
men
the
four
french
battalions
just
over
nevertheless
the
impossible
happened
when
the
two
columns
of
the
ligne
came
down
with
drums
beating
and
levelled
bayonets
against
the
centre
of
the
firm
if
disorderly
line
in
front
they
were
checked
by
the
furious
fire
that
broke
out
against
them
from
the
semicircle
into
which
they
had
pushed
this
was
one
more
example
of
the
fact
established
at
maida
five
years
before
and
reaffirmed
at
vimiero
talavera
and
bussaco
that
no
column
could
break
the
british
line
by
mere
impetus
in
this
case
the
french
had
every
advantage
since
they
were
absolutely
intact
troops
and
had
the
ground
entirely
in
their
favour
while
the
guards
and
the
wing
of
the
opposed
to
them
had
marched
two
miles
in
haste
had
then
climbed
a
steep
slope
under
fire
had
lost
their
order
and
were
firing
up
hill
but
the
fire
was
delivered
with
astounding
accuracy
considering
that
the
men
were
blown
with
their
climb
and
dreadfully
exhausted
the
whole
head
of
each
of
the
descending
columns
was
blown
to
pieces
the
rest
came
to
a
standstill
and
crowding
together
in
a
disorderly
clump
opened
an
irregular
fire
against
the
british
line
the
marshal
who
was
present
in
person
on
the
top
of
the
cerro
then
brought
up
his
reserve
the
two
battalions
of
grenadiers
under
general
chaudron
rousseau
he
himself
and
the
brigadier
were
both
distinctly
seen
leading
on
the
column
the
marshal
waving
his
large
hat
over
his
head
this
charge
was
delivered
against
the
right
of
dilkes
s
line
where
the
guards
and
wing
of
the
lay
that
of
the
ligne
had
been
more
against
the
centre
and
the
guards
but
the
result
was
the
same
though
the
contest
was
more
long
and
bloody
the
grenadiers
are
said
to
have
struggled
forward
losing
heavily
at
each
step
till
their
front
was
within
a
very
few
yards
of
dilkes
s
line
it
was
only
then
that
they
halted
and
began
to
fire
a
fatal
step
in
such
a
contest
where
impetus
was
the
sole
chance
of
the
attacking
mass
and
superiority
in
musketry
fire
owing
to
the
longer
front
was
on
the
side
of
the
english
line
this
of
course
was
a
terribly
murderous
business
to
both
sides
as
the
figures
presently
to
be
quoted
will
show
but
as
in
all
similar
contests
during
the
peninsular
war
the
line
hit
harder
than
the
column
the
four
french
battalions
began
at
last
to
give
way
and
could
not
be
kept
together
then
victor
tried
to
bring
in
the
two
left
battalions
of
his
line
to
their
aid
but
these
two
units
were
pestered
and
impeded
when
they
began
to
move
off
from
their
first
position
by
the
remains
of
browne
s
flank
battalion
which
though
reduced
to
under
muskets
began
to
press
forward
again
when
the
troops
hitherto
in
their
front
commenced
to
move
off
to
the
right
they
darted
from
behind
trees
briars
brakes
and
out
of
hollows
says
blakeney
i
could
imagine
myself
like
roderick
dhu
upon
benledi
s
side
it
was
a
magic
effect
we
confidently
advanced
up
the
hill
and
unlike
most
advances
in
this
one
our
numbers
increased
as
we
proceeded
soldiers
of
the
flank
battalion
joining
at
every
this
scattered
little
force
hung
on
to
the
flank
of
victor
s
right
and
prevented
it
from
rallying
the
broken
force
now
recoiling
from
in
front
of
dilkes
the
flankers
had
even
the
good
fortune
to
capture
a
howitzer
from
the
left
of
victor
s
battery
placed
by
the
chapel
on
the
hilltop
another
gun
was
taken
by
the
guards
in
their
forward
progress
it
must
have
been
just
at
this
crisis
that
the
whole
french
mass
broke
up
to
this
moment
it
had
been
recoiling
sullenly
still
keeping
up
some
fire
from
its
rear
but
now
the
observer
saw
with
loud
and
murmuring
sounds
ruffin
s
division
and
rousseau
s
chosen
grenadiers
rolling
with
a
whirling
motion
down
into
the
valley
below
leaving
their
two
brave
generals
mortally
wounded
on
the
hill
which
was
left
in
possession
of
their
bloodstained
blakeney
the
exhausted
victors
halted
for
a
short
time
to
and
were
in
a
more
orderly
line
than
they
had
hitherto
shown
when
they
commenced
to
follow
the
enemy
down
the
slope
the
casualties
in
this
part
of
the
field
may
now
be
stated
for
neither
party
was
to
lose
many
more
men
in
the
last
episode
of
the
fight
dilkes
s
brigade
and
browne
s
flank
battalion
had
gone
up
the
hill
with
officers
and
men
they
lost
officers
and
men
about
men
out
of
every
in
the
fight
the
french
loss
was
positively
more
proportionately
not
quite
so
great
in
the
six
battalions
of
ruffin
and
chaudron
rousseau
there
seem
to
have
been
about
officers
and
men
present
of
these
officers
and
men
were
left
on
the
hill
men
in
every
the
trophies
remaining
with
the
victors
were
two
guns
and
unwounded
prisoners
beside
the
multitude
of
disabled
men
left
on
the
slope
for
further
details

the
letters
of

stanhope
and
onslow

s
vii
pp
while
this
bloody
business
had
been
going
on
upon
the
cerro
del
puerco
it
may
be
asked
what
were
the
spaniards
on
the
coast
road
doing
whittingham
s
squadrons
and
the
five
battalions
of
cruz
murgeon
and
beguines
the
last
named
with
his
three
battalions
shepherding
what
was
left
of
the
quietly
marched
off
along
the
sea
and
joined
la
peña
by
the
torre
bermeja
whittingham
was
of
a
little
positive
use
he
continued
all
through
the
fight
to
contain
and
occasionally
to
bicker
with
the
french
cavalry
regiment
dragoons
that
faced
him
near
the
torre
barrosa
the
two
battalions
of
cruz
murgeon
supported
him
this
force
certainly
did
not
do
its
share
german
hussars
spanish
horse
and
spanish
foot
simply
kept
out
of
action
french
horse
this
was
something
but
not
much
for
the
dragoons
could
not
have
interfered
very
effectively
on
the
hill
against
dilkes
s
advance
because
the
south
side
of
the
cerro
is
too
precipitous
for
horsemen
in
short
whittingham
s
statement
in
his
report
to
la
peña
that
all
the
cavalry
fulfilled
its
duty
brilliantly
is
a
sad
overstatement
of
the
case
let
us
turn
now
to
the
other
half
of
the
fight
where
wheatley
s
brigade
and
duncan
s
guns
were
facing
leval
on
the
open
plain
just
outside
the
edge
of
the
wood
at
the
moment
when
browne
attacked
the
cerro
barnard
s
rifles
and
bushe
s
portuguese
were
throwing
themselves
in
a
no
less
resolute
fashion
upon
the
six
french
battalions
in
their
front
they
had
the
advantage
of
being
invisible
to
the
enemy
till
they
emerged
from
the
wood
only
yards
in
his
front
and
of
being
supported
within
a
few
minutes
of
their
arrival
by
duncan
s
ten
guns
while
browne
had
no
artillery
assistance
whatever
and
was
seen
by
the
french
for
half
a
mile
before
he
got
near
them
the
confusion
in
leval
s
division
on
being
suddenly
attacked
by
an
unexpected
swarm
of
skirmishers
pouring
out
of
the
wood
was
extreme
so
much
were
they
taken
aback
that
of
the
line
assures
us
in
his
memoirs
that
a
false
alarm
of
cavalry
was
raised
and
that
his
regiment
and
the
first
battalion
of
the
formed
square
before
the
mistake
was
recognized
and
caught
some
shells
from
duncan
s
guns
in
that
uncomfortable
situation
before
they
had
time
to
deploy
for
action
against
infantry
this
they
had
to
do
under
a
heavy
fire
from
barnard
s
riflemen
who
had
advanced
quite
close
to
them
leval
s
fighting
formation
was
the
usual
column
of
divisions
a
front
of
two
companies
and
a
depth
of
three
in
each
battalion
or
since
these
units
averaged
men
each
and
the
companies
over
bayonets
a
front
of
men
and
a
depth
of
nine
the
length
of
barnard
s
skirmishing
line
with
his
rifles
seems
to
have
covered
the
front
of
the
right
battalion
of
the
and
the
left
battalion
of
the
some
men
the
did
considerable
execution
on
them
while
they
were
getting
out
of
square
formation
but
when
the
columns
advanced
firing
the
skirmishing
line
had
to
fall
back
its
loss
was
heavy
killed
and
wounded
among
the
latter
barnard
commanding
the
battalion
the
next
troops
whom
the
french
encountered
were
the
flank
companies
of
the
portuguese
men
only
who
had
advanced
on
the
right
rear
of
the
supporting
them
in
échelon
this
was
a
new
corps
which
had
been
sent
to
cadiz
the
moment
it
was
raised
in
and
had
never
been
under
fire
before
considering
their
hopeless
position
alone
in
front
of
an
advancing
division
the
portuguese
behaved
very
well
they
held
their
ground
for
some
time
while
their
colonel
bushe
as
is
recorded
by
an
rode
slowly
backward
and
forward
behind
them
with
his
spectacles
on
crying
as
the
balls
whistled
past
que
bella
musica
to
encourage
his
men
but
he
was
soon
mortally
wounded
and
after
his
fall
the
line
melted
away
and
drifted
to
the
rear
after
having
kept
a
battalion
of
the
french
engaged
for
some
minutes
proportionately
its
loss
was
much
the
same
as
that
of
the
rifles
killed
and
wounded
out
of
present
one
man
in
six
says
that
he
personally
captured
colonel
bushe
who
was
riding
away
slowly
from
the
front
disabled
by
a
wound
this
seems
contradicted
by
the
very
circumstantial
evidence
of
bunbury
adjutant
of
the
portuguese
who
says
that
bushe
had
his
horse
shot
under
him
and
was
mortally
wounded
that
he
declined
being
sent
to
the
rear
and
was
propped
up
and
left
behind
by
his
own
orders
french
soldiers
were
seen
rifling
him
as
he
lay
the
first
act
of
the
drama
on
this
front
was
thus
complete
the
detaining
force
sent
out
by
graham
had
been
as
he
expected
driven
in
with
loss
though
not
an
appalling
loss
of
per
such
as
browne
s
gallant
flankers
had
suffered
on
the
cerro
but
the
main
body
was
now
up
and
had
formed
in
the
edge
of
the
wood
to
the
left
of
duncan
s
guns
with
no
loss
or
interruption
since
it
had
been
well
covered
all
the
time
there
were
now
some
men
in
line
the
strong
on
the
left
then
the
bayonets
of
the
coldstreamers
the
nearly
strong
in
the
centre
beyond
them
the
right
wing
of
the
about
bayonets
next
to
the
guns
which
were
still
under
the
protection
of
the
flank
companies
of
the
which
served
as
their
escort
throughout
the
fight
the
broken
screen
of
light
troops
which
had
just
retired
was
by
no
means
out
of
action
the
formed
up
again
behind
the
the
portuguese
behind
the
and
both
were
used
again
before
the
battle
was
over
the
formation
of
the
french
at
this
moment
was
an
uneven
line
of
four
battalion
columns
counting
from
their
left
the
other
two
battalions
were
in
reserve
the
behind
the
french
battery
which
was
now
engaged
with
duncan
s
guns
the
provisional
battalion
of
grenadiers
more
to
the
right
and
some
distance
behind
the
regiment
the
whole
was
advancing
but
slowly
the
battalions
in
the
front
line
were
firing
the
centre
was
a
little
more
to
the
front
than
the
wings
the
being
ahead
of
the
other
battalions
because
as
its
de
remarks
in
his
memoir
he
only
allowed
his
men
to
fire
volleys
by
order
while
the
units
on
his
right
and
left
were
using
independent
fire
all
had
suffered
in
the
previous
fight
with
barnard
and
the
portuguese
and
much
needed
time
to
which
was
not
granted
them
because
the
english
main
line
charged
the
moment
that
the
light
troops
had
cleared
off
from
its
front
it
is
curious
to
note
in
the
french
memoirs
that
the
authors
all
write
as
if
they
had
an
oppressive
feeling
that
the
superiority
of
numbers
was
against
them
and
that
they
were
being
led
to
a
forlorn
hope
this
was
caused
partly
by
the
immense
extent
of
the
british
line
in
proportion
to
its
depth
still
more
by
the
happy
existence
of
the
wood
behind
wheatley
s
brigade
it
had
already
vomited
out
two
lively
attacking
lines
and
the
enemy
presupposed
a
third
in
reserve
nearly
all
the
french
narratives
definitely
say
that
they
were
attacked
by
three
lines
while
really
there
was
only
one
with
the
screen
of
light
troops
which
had
already
been
used
up
as
to
the
complaint
concerning
inferior
numbers
it
is
certain
that
leval
s
division
had
men
and
wheatley
s
brigade
only
the
only
superiority
of
the
british
was
that
in
the
artillery
duel
now
going
on
to
the
right
of
the
line
they
had
ten
guns
to
six
and
soon
crushed
the
french
battery
so
that
it
gave
no
effective
support
to
its
infantry
only
one
of
the
french
battalions
attempted
to
deploy
into

this
was
the
of

which

on
from
first
to

of
the
remarks
they
never
got
into

nor
did
they
ever
intend
to
do
so
i
believe

the
fight
owing
to
the

being
slightly
advanced
began
a
little
earlier
there
than
on
the
wings
the
first
clash
being
between
the
column
of
the
french
led
by
and
the
line
of
the
led
by
that
enthusiastic
fighter
major
gough
we
have
narratives
from
both
of
them
and
each
insists
that
he
kept
down
the
fire
of
his
men
till
they
were
within
a
very
short
distance
of
the
enemy
sixty
yards
says
says
gough
there
was
then
a
single
volley
exchanged
and
the
french
column
much
the
harder
hit
of
the
two
broke
up
as
they
were
in
column
when
they
broke
says
gough
they
could
not
get
away
it
was
therefore
a
scene
of
most
dreadful
carnage
and
i
must
own
my
weakness
as
i
was
in
front
of
the
regiment
i
was
in
the
very
middle
of
them
and
i
could
not
cut
down
one
though
i
might
have
twenty
they
seemed
so
confounded
and
confused
there
was
indeed
a
fearful
crowding
and
here
for
the
battalion
of
the
french
yielding
before
the
fire

the
british
guns
and

unfortunate

they
came
upon
the
battalion
of

which
had
hitherto
been
standing
in

behind

battery
and
which
leval
had
just
ordered
up
to
support
the
broken

gough
with
the
greatest
difficulty
succeeded
in
forming
about
half
his
scattered
though
victorious
regiment
to
face
this
new
enemy
but
there
was
hardly
a
collision
all
the
other
french
units
were
broken
by
this
time
and
the
hesitated
after
firing

we
came
within
about
fifty
paces

they
for

fortunately
broke
and

they
done

as
my
men
were
at
the
moment
they
might
have
cut
us
to
that
this
battalion
can
not
have
behaved
well
is
sufficiently
shown
by
the
casualty
list
out
of
men
present
it
only
lost
far
the
smallest
proportional
loss
in
the
whole
french
army
that
day
probably
the
weakness
of
its
resistance
is
partly
to
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
it
was
being
outflanked
by
the
wing
of
the
who
must
have
been
extending
in
this
direction
at
the
moment
prolonging
the
line
of
the
eastward
in
its
double
victory

wing
of

be
dealt
with

the
french
in
two
battalion
columns
was
facing
the
british
and
the
coldstreamers
on
their
right
this
was
the
only
part
of
the
field
in
which
the
french
tried
at
all
to
manœuvre
the
right
battalion
of
the
began
to
deploy
and
to
turn
the
british
flank
by
moving
westward
into
the
edge
of
the
pine
wood
but
with
little
effect
we
have
a
short
account
of
this
fight
in
the
memoirs
of
cadell
of
the
we
had
formed
line
under
cover
of
the
and
then
advanced
to
meet
their
right
wing
which
was
coming
down
in
close
column
a
great
advantage
and
here
the
coolness
of
colonel
belson
was
conspicuous
he
moved
us
up
without
firing
a
shot
close
to
their
right
battalion
which
just
then
began
to
deploy
the
colonel
then
gave
orders
to
fire
by
platoons
from
centre
to
flanks
and
low
fire
at
their
legs
and
spoil
their
this
was
kept
up
for
a
short
time
with
dreadful
effect
the
action
being
now
general
all
along
the
line
we
twice
attempted
to
charge
but
the
enemy
being
double
our
strength
since
our
flank
companies
were
away
only
retired
a
little
on
each
occasion
finally
giving
three
cheers
we
charged
a
third
time
and
succeeded
the
enemy
gave
way
and
fled
in
every
of
all
leval
s
division
there
now
remained
unbroken
only
the
single
battalion
of
under
colonel
meunier
behind
the
right
rear
the
routed
fled
diagonally
to
take
cover
behind
it
belson
did
not
pursue
very
rapidly
and
this
wing
of
the
beaten
division
moved
off
to
the
flank
covered
by
the
grenadiers
and
presently
met
the
wrecks
of
the
and
the
not
far
north
of
the
laguna
del
puerco
the
pool
which
lies
beyond
the
heath
to
the
east
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
give
the
losses
the
with
men
present
lost
about
one
man
in
four
the
grenadiers
hardly
suffered
at
all
never
having
come
into
close
action
of
the
british
opposite
them
the
with
men
in
the
field
had
casualties
the
coldstream
companies
lost
out
of
these
two
companies
whose
losses
as
it
is
seen
here
were
heavy
must
have
been
engaged
with
part
of
the
left
battalion
of
the
french
just
as
leval
s
division
arrived
near
the
laguna
it
was
joined
by
the
wrecks
of
ruffin
s
descending
in
disorder
from
the
northern
slope
of
the
cerro
it
says
much
for
the
resolution
of
victor
that
he
succeeded
in
halting
the
two
disorganized
masses
and
deployed
two
or
three
comparatively
intact
battalions
and
the
ten
guns
which
remained
to
him
to
cover
the
rallying
of
the
rest
at
the
same
moment
his
cavalry
the
dragoons
which
had
galloped
away
round
the
east
side
of
the
cerro
when
ruffin
was
beaten
off
it
came
in
and
drew
up
on
the
right
and
left
of
the
whole
it
was
a
bold
bid
to
secure
an
unmolested
retreat
for
no
more
could
be
hoped
some
time
was
available
for
rallying
the
troops
for
graham
had
also
to
get
his
exhausted
men
into
order
they
came
up
at
last
wheatley
s
brigade
on
the
left
dilkes
s
on
the
right
the
guns
in
the
centre
the
latter
were
set
to
play
on
the
new
front
of
the
french
which
they
did
with
great
effect
the
enemy
being
in
a
cramped
mass
the
skirmishers
went
forward
and
a
third
separate
engagement
seemed
about
to
begin
when
a
small
new
force
intervened
this
was
one
of
the
two
squadrons
of
german
hussars
which
had
followed
the
french
dragoons
around
the
back
of
the
cerro
not
on
the
orders
of
whittingham
who
made
no
haste
to
pursue
but
on
those
of
graham
s
ponsonby
who
had
carried
them
off
on
his
own
responsibility
coming
like
a
whirlwind
across
the
lower
slope
of
the
hill
this
squadron
upset
the
french
squadron
of
the
dragoons
which
formed
victor
s
flank
guard
on
this
side
and
drove
it
in
upon
the
infantry
small
though
the
shock
was
it
sufficed
to
upset
the
equilibrium
of
the
demoralized
french
divisions
they
went
off
in
a
sudden
rush
leaving
behind
them
two
more
guns
and
streamed
across
the
plain
towards
chiclana
the
battle
was
over
there
was
no
pursuit
for
the
cautious
whittingham
came
up
ten
minutes
too
late
with
the
rest
of
the
cavalry
in
time
to
see
the
last
of
the
enemy
disappearing
in
the
woods
with
him
came
up
also
the
two
infantry
battalions
under
cruz
murgeon
and
these
were
the
only
spanish
troops
that
graham
saw
during
the
battle
it
may
be
noted
that
we
have
hitherto
not
had
occasion
to
say
one
word
of
general
la
peña
or
his
two
infantry
divisions
since
the
main
action
began
on
being
informed
at
the
same
time
as
graham
of
the
approach
of
victor
from
chiclana
la
peña
had
no
thought
save
to
defend
the
isthmus
by
the
torre
bermeja
against
the
approaching
enemy
he
drew
up
his
own
eleven
battalions
across
it
in
a
double
or
treble
line
while
zayas
with
those
which
had
come
out
of
cadiz
watched
villatte
across
the
almanza
creek
when
beguines
appeared
from
the
cerro
by
the
he
was
put
into
the
same
mass
which
must
have
risen
to
something
like
men
presently
news
came
from
the
wood
that
graham
had
faced
about
and
was
fighting
the
french
la
peña
as
his
own
dispatch
shows
concluded
that
the
english
must
inevitably
be
beaten
and
refused
to
stir
a
man
to
support
them
or
to
bring
them
off
zayas
repeatedly
asked
leave
to
march
up
to
join
wheatley
s
flank
or
to
cross
the
almanza
and
to
attack
villatte
but
was
refused
permission
the
first
report
to
the
effect
that
graham
was
driving
the
french
back
la
peña
refused
to
credit
it
was
not
till
the
fugitives
of
leval
s
division
were
seen
retreating
past
the
head
of
the
almanza
creek
that
he
could
be
got
to
accept
the
idea
that
graham
was
victorious
and
when
pressed
to
join
in
the
pursuit
by
zayas
he
merely
said
that
the
men
were
tired
and
the
day
far
spent
the
reaping
of
the
fruits
of
victory
might
be
left
for
the
morrow
when
it
is
remembered
that
la
peña
was
only
two
miles
from
wheatley
s
and
three
from
the
cerro
his
conduct
seems
astounding
as
well
as
selfish
graham
s
fight
lasted
nearly
two
hours
la
peña
could
have
ridden
over
to
see
what
was
going
on
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
refused
to
stir
and
deliberately
sacrificed
his
allies
because
he
had
got
a
comfortable
almost
an
impregnable
position
across
the
narrow
isthmus
and
would
not
move
out
of
it
whatever
might
happen
to
graham
this
timid
and
selfish
policy
was
an
exact
repetition
of
his
betrayal
of
castaños
at
tudela
in
with
his
men
he
could
have
crushed
villatte
if
he
had
advanced
on
one
front
or
have
annihilated
the
remnants
of
ruffin
and
leval
if
he
had
chosen
to
act
on
the
other
illustration
barrosa
he
had
his
reward
next
morning
graham
after
collecting
his
wounded
and
his
trophies
recrossed
into
the
isle
of
leon
formally
giving
notice
that
in
consequence
of
yesterday
s
proceedings
he
was
forced
to
withdraw
his
consent
given
in
february
to
serve
under
la
peña
and
to
fall
back
on
the
discretional
orders
given
by
the
british
government
not
to
undertake
any
operations
in
which
he
was
not
himself
in
chief
command
it
is
impossible
to
blame
him
no
one
could
deny
after
what
had
happened
on
the
that
it
was
absolutely
unsafe
to
go
out
in
la
peña
s
company
wellington
sent
his
complete
approval
to
graham
well
remembering
his
own
experiences
with
cuesta

i
concur
in
the
propriety
of
your
withdrawing
to
the
isla

he
wrote
as
much
as

admire

promptitude
and
determination
of
your

much
harder
out

with

guns
the
units
that
had
fought
in
the
cerro
and
on
the
heath
by
the
wood
were
absolutely
demoralized
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
put
them
in
line
again
for
several
days
see
the
figures
of
losses
in
appendix
no
if
the
slightest
push
forward
had
been
made
on
the
it
is
certain
that
the
siege
would
have
been
raised
victor
had
rallied
the
broken
troops
behind
the
wood
of
chiclana
on
villatte
s
comparatively
intact
division
and
had
been
joined
in
the
late
afternoon
by
cassagne
s
men
who
had
at
last
come
up
from
medina
sidonia
but
there
was
panic
all
along
the
lines
while
the
battle
had
been
going
on
english
and
spanish
gunboats
had
threatened
their
garrison
and
had
made
small
disembarkations
at
one
or
two
points
a
battery
had
been
captured
near
santa
maria
if
a
more
serious
attack
were
made
from
the
sea
next
morning
it
was
clear
that
the
line
would
break
at
some
point
the
sinister
phrases
destruction
of
the
forts
and
abandonment
of
the
position
flew
from
mouth
to
mouth
victor
called
a
council
of
war
and
proposed
to
offer
a
second
battle
behind
chiclana
but
he
found
little
support
among
the
generals
it
was
finally
decided
that
if
the
allies
should
come
on
in
full
force
next
morning
only
such
resistance
should
be
made
as
would
allow
time
to
blow
up
most
of
the
forts
and
burn
the
stores
and
the
flotilla
the
corps
would
retreat
on
seville
victor
proposed
that
one
or
two
positions
where
there
were
solid
closed
works
like
fort
sénarmont
and
the
trocadero
should
be
left
garrisoned
and
told
to
defend
themselves
until
the
army
should
return
strengthened
by
soult
and
sebastiani
to
relieve
them
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
would
really
have
risked
this
move
since
the
time
of
his
return
would
have
been
most
uncertain
and
he
might
very
probably
have
been
making
a
present
to
the
enemy

on
the
part
of
the
enemy
was
that
a
swarm
of
english
gunboats
and
launches
appeared
at
the
north
end
of
the
lines
and
threw
ashore
seamen
and
marines
who
occupied
puerto
santa
maria
for
some
hours
and
destroyed
all
the
smaller
batteries
between
that
place
and
rota
unhindered
for
the
french
had
concentrated
in
the
fort
of
santa
catalina
and
abandoned
all
their
minor
posts
but
the
flotilla
withdrew
at
dusk
leaving
victor
much
puzzled
as
to
the
purpose
of
his
adversaries
on
the
morning
of
march
he
sent
out
a
cavalry
reconnaissance
of
several
squadrons
which
brought
back
the
astonishing
news
that
it
had
explored
the
whole
of
the
country
between
chiclana
and
the
sea
including
the
battlefield
and
had
seen
no
hostile
troops
save
a
large
encampment
on
the
bermeja
isthmus
just
above
the
bridge
of
boats
leading
into
the
isla
de
leon
see
for
a
curious
note
concerning
this
incident
lapéne
appendix
what
had
happened
was
that
la
peña
had
determined
to
give
up
the
expedition
and
retire
to
cadiz
he
had
declined
to
listen
to
a
proposition
made
by
graham
and
admiral
keats
that
he
should
advance
cautiously
towards
chiclana
while
the
british
naval
and
land
forces
made
a
combined
attack
upon
the
trocadero
he
did
not
even
send
out
cavalry
patrols
to
discover
what
had
become
of
victor
if
they
had
gone
forth
they
would
have
found
that
the
marshal
had
retired
beyond
the
saltillo
and
would
have
discerned
his
preparations
for
a
general
retreat
but
after
remaining
encamped
by
the
torre
bermeja
during
the
whole
of
the
and
the
greater
part
of
the
the
spanish
army
crossed
the
bridge
of
boats
into
the
isla
and
took
it
up
behind
them
only
beguines
and
his
three
battalions
were
left
on
the
continent
with
orders
to
return
to
their
old
haunts
in
the
ronda
mountains
this
little
force
retired
to
medina
sidonia
on
the
and
repulsed
there
a
french
column
of
men
which
came
up
to
occupy
the
town
but
next
day
a
whole
brigade
marched
against
them
whereupon
beguines
evacuated
medina
and
went
off
towards
san
roque
and
algesiras
it
is
sometimes
asserted
that
la
peña
proposed
to
continue
the
campaign
and
was
foiled
by
graham
s
departure
into
the
isla
but
we
have
graham
s
own
statement
in
his
dispatch
to
henry
wellesley
of
march
that
no
such
proposal
was
made
the
only
regret
expressed
to
me
at
head
quarters
on
the
morning
of
the
on
knowing
of
my
intention
to
send
the
british
troops
across
the
santi
petri
was
that
the
opportunity
of
withdrawing
the
spanish
troops
during
the
night
was
lost
and
on
my
observing
that
after
such
a
defeat
there
was
no
risk
of
attack
from
the
enemy
a
very
contrary
opinion
was
victor
was
therefore
able
on
the
to
reoccupy
the
evacuated
southern
wing
of
his
lines
and
to
issue
an
absurd
dispatch
in
which
he
claimed
that
barrosa
had
been
a
victory
but
for
the
loss
of
men
and
a
severe
shock
inflicted
on
the
morale
of
his
troops
he
was
in
exactly
the
same
position
that
he
had
held
on
the
the
whole
fruits
of
the
battle
of
barrosa
had
been
lost
what
they
might
have
been
it
is
possible
up
to
a
certain
point
to
foresee
supposing
that
graham
and
not
la
peña
had
been
in
command
the
army
raised
to
nearly
men
by
the
junction
of
zayas
and
of
the
still
in
cadiz
would
have
marched
on
chiclana
upon
the
victor
would
have
blown
up
the
lines
and
retired
towards
seville
but
there
would
have
been
no
reinforcements
for
him
there
and
he
could
only
have
been
brought
up
to
fighting
strength
by
the
calling
in
of
sebastiani
and
godinot
but
if
these
generals
came
up
to
his
aid
granada
and
cordova
would
have
had
to
be
evacuated
and
the
insurgents
would
have
swept
all
over
eastern
andalusia
the
allies
could
not
have
held
the
field
for
even
before
soult
s
return
from
badajoz
there
were
still
french
troops
south
of
the
sierra
morena
the
siege
of
cadiz
would
ultimately
no
doubt
have
been
recommenced
granada
and
cordova
reoccupied
but
meanwhile
the
immense
work
spent
on
the
lines
would
have
had
to
be
recommenced
and
the
ascendancy
of
the
french
arms
in
the
south
would
have
received
a
rude
shock
possibly
soult
might
have
blown
up
badajoz
after
its
fall
on
march
instead
of
holding
it
for
he
would
have
required
all
his
strength
to
reconquer
andalusia
but
further
than
the
immediate
result
of
the
inevitable
raising
of
the
siege
of
cadiz
it
is
useless
to
make
speculations
the
alarms
of
the
french
in
andalusia
did
not
end
with
victor
s
reoccupation
of
the
lines
another
episode
was
still
to
be
played
out
before
matters
settled
down
the
indefatigable
ballasteros
having
rested
for
a
short
time
in
portugal
came
back
into
the
condado
de
niebla
in
the
end
of
february
with
men
he
defeated
on
the
rio
tinto
general
remond
whose
weak
column
was
the
only
french
force
left
west
of
the
guadalquivir
since
gazan
s
departure
march
he
then
marched
promptly
on
seville
having
good
information
of
the
weakness
of
the
garrison
that
had
been
left
there
on
march
the
day
of
barrosa
he
was
at
san
lucar
la
mayor
only
twenty
miles
from
the
great
city
the
governor
daricau
came
out
against
him
and
joined
remond
with
men
and
three
guns
all
that
he
could
dispose
of
leaving
seville
in
the
hands
of
a
miserable
garrison
composed
of
convalescents
and
of
doubtful
faith
if
daricau
had
been
beaten
the
city
and
all
its
establishments
must
have
been
lost
in
a
day
but
ballasteros
refused
to
fight
and
retired
behind
the
rio
tinto
having
had
false
news
that
a
force
sent
from
estremadura
by
soult
was
on
his
flank
daricau
returned
to
seville
on
march
leaving
remond
to
observe
ballasteros
and
was
joined
by
some
detachments
sent
very
tardily
by
godinot
to
strengthen
the
garrison
but
he
had
received
such
alarming
accounts
of
the
results
of
the
battle
of
barrosa
that
he
sent
these
troops
on
to
victor
and
remained
with
a
very
weak
force
in
the
city
but
on
march
ballasteros
suddenly
coming
back
from
the
rio
tinto
surprised
remond
at
la
palma
took
two
guns
from
him
and
drove
him
back
into
seville
on
the
the
spanish
general
was
back
at
san
lucar
and
causing
great
dismay
to
daricau
who
sent
urgent
demands
for
help
to
soult
since
barrosa
he
could
look
for
no
help
from
elsewhere
he
was
saved
by
the
rumour
of
the
capitulation
of
badajoz
which
frightened
ballasteros
away
for
the
spaniard
rightly
judged
that
soult
could
and
must
send
a
considerable
force
against
him
now
that
his
hands
were
freed
when
therefore
the
marshal
as
we
have
already
seen
came
back
in
haste
to
andalusia
with
gazan
s
division
fearing
that
he
might
find
ballasteros
in
seville
and
graham
pursuing
victor
from
the
evacuated
lines
of
cadiz
he
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
that
both
dangers
had
been
avoided
and
that
the
crisis
in
andalusia
was
at
an
end
his
further
movements
belong
to
a
different
campaign
and
will
be
related
in
their
due
place
see
above
meanwhile
graham
and
la
peña
were
engaged
in
a
violent
controversy
the
british
general
had
sent
the
most
scathing
comments
on
his
colleague
s
conduct
to
the
ambassador
henry
wellesley
and
to
wellington
and
made
his
complaints
also
to
the
regency
la
peña
on
the
other
hand
claimed
the
credit
of
the
victory
of
barrosa
for
his
own
skilful
management
according
to
his
magniloquent
dispatches
all
had
gone
well
till
graham
spoilt
the
campaign
by
taking
his
division
back
to
cadiz
the
regency
seemed
partly
to
believe
him
as
they
conferred
on
him
the
grand
cross
of
the
order
of
charles
iii
though
at
the
same
time
they
offered
graham
the
title
of
a
grandee
of
spain
which
he
refused
for
he
would
not
be
honoured
in
such
company
but
spanish
as
well
as
british
public
opinion
was
so
much
against
la
peña
that
he
was
almost
immediately
deprived
of
his
command
which
was
given
to
the
marquis
coupigny
while
graham
whose
strong
language
had
made
it
impossible
for
him
to
be
left
in
contact
with
the
regency
was
withdrawn
to
serve
with
wellington
in
portugal
and
made
over
the
charge
of
the
troops
at
cadiz
to
general
cooke
summing
up
the
results
of
the
barrosa
campaign
we
may
say
that
all
it
had
accomplished
was
so
to
alarm
soult
that
he
came
back
in
haste
from
estremadura
leaving
there
under
mortier
a
force
far
too
weak
to
threaten
any
harm
to
wellington
and
portugal
but
even
if
barrosa
had
never
been
fought
soult
would
have
been
harmless
in
any
case
because
masséna
was
gone
from
santarem
before
badajoz
fell
section
xxiv
masséna
s
retreat
from
portugal
chapter
i
santarem
to
celorico
march
on
the
of
march
wellington
began
at
last
to
discover
the
real
position
of
the
various
french
corps
till
their
rear
was
well
past
thomar
it
had
been
difficult
to
divine
the
main
trend
of
their
movements
for
the
various
columns
had
been
crossing
each
other
s
routes
in
a
very
puzzling
fashion
but
it
now
became
clear
that
masséna
was
intending
to
use
all
the
three
lines
of
communication
which
lead
from
the
plain
of
the
tagus
to
the
lower
valley
of
the
mondego
reynier
and
the
corps
after
passing
thomar
had
taken
the
bad
mountain
road
by
cabaços
and
espinhal
far
to
the
east
and
would
come
down
on
to
the
mondego
near
the
ponte
de
murcella
a
little
above
coimbra
the
corps
had
taken
the
central
road
that
by
chão
de
maçans
and
ameiro
which
joins
the
main
at
pombal
loison
and
his
division
having
crossed
the
route
of
reynier
fell
into
the
chão
de
maçans
road
behind
junot
ney
after
holding
leiria
till
the
with
the
divisions
of
marchand
and
mermet
fell
back
on
that
day
a
march
along
the
great
road
in
the
plain
the
mentioned
above
and
then
halted
in
front
of
him

marching

with
conroux

division
of
the
corps
escorting
the
main
train
of
the
army
such
as
it
was
it
reached

five
miles
south
of
pombal
on
the
night

the
montbrun

all
with
ney
of
the
three
columns
reynier
s
was
strong
that
formed
by
junot
with
loison
in
his
rear
had
about
men
that
of
ney
and
montbrun
with
conroux
in
front
of
them
comprised
over
sabres
and
bayonets
the
main
fact
to
be
borne
in
mind
by
the
british
general
was
that
reynier
had
been
sent
on
an
external
road
separated
by
a
very
difficult
mountain
chain
from
those
followed
by
the
other
two
columns
but
that
ney
and
junot
would
undoubtedly
unite
at
pombal
where
their
roads
met
so
that
a
mass
of
men
would
be
collected
at
that
important
centre
of
communication
on
the
or
the
but
reynier
could
not
join
them
till
the
columns
should
have
got
down
to
the
mondego
some
days
later
masséna
was
rightly
enough
trying
to
use
as
many
roads
as
possible
both
to
avoid
overcrowding
of
troops
and
trains
on
a
single
road
and
also
in
order
that
wider
foraging
might
be
possible
when
the
army
should
get
out
of
the
devastated
region
north
of
thomar
and
descend
into
the
valley
of
the
mondego
where
it
was
hoped
that
food
would
be
far
more
procurable
but
the
result
of
the
disposition
was
that
reynier
would
not
be
available
for
several
days
if
the
british
threw
their
main
force
on
to
the
rear
of
ney
and
junot
and
brought
them
to
action
the
forces
of
the
french
corps
five
days
later

the
numbers
were
much

now
reached
by

by
following

and

the
french

that
had
taken
it
the
commander
of
the

might
hope
to
reach

in
time
to
prevent
the
french
from
taking
up
a
secure
position
on
the
lower
mondego
and
establishing
themselves
in

on

banks
for
it
was
his
main
object
to
turn
them
away
from
coimbra
and
the
and
to
force
them
up
into
the
eastern
mountains
and
towards
the
borders
of
spain
at
first
he
did
not
think
that
the
line
of
the
mondego
could
be
held
against
the
retreating
french
by
the
trifling
portuguese
militia
force
that
lay
behind
it
trant
s
seven
battalions
at
coimbra
wilson
s
four
at
peñacova
which
did
not
amount
together
to
more
than
or
troops
of
very
inferior
quality
he
issued
orders
to
those
generals
to
retire
without
committing
themselves
to
an
attempt
to
defend
the
line
of
the
river
trant
had
better
go
behind
the
vouga
wilson
might
retire
on
vizeu
both
would
ultimately
join
the
northern
reserves
under
baccelar
and
with
that
general
in
defending
the
city
of
oporto
but
wellington
hoped
that
matters
would
never
reach
the
point
at
which
the
safety
of
oporto
came
in
question
for
he
thought
that
he
would
be
pressing
the
rear
of
the
french
so
hard
in
a
few
days
that
they
would
be
thinking
of
other
things
than
taking
the
offensive
against
northern
portugal
he
would
do
his
best
to
thrust
them
towards
the
frontiers
of
spain
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
shall
see
that
he
more
than
fulfilled
his
own
forecast
for
the
french
were
so
hotly
pursued
that
they
never
succeeded
in
crossing
the
mondego
or
seizing
coimbra
when
they
had
reached
its
gates
masséna
refused
to
take
the
risk
of
passing
the
river
at
a
moment
when
his
rear
was
in
such
dire
trouble
that
the
whole
army
would
have
been
in
danger
of
destruction
if
he
had
been
attacked
when
the
actual
operation
of
passage
was
in
progress
wellington
to
baccelar
march
i
conclude
that
colonel
trant
will
have
retired
from
coimbra
upon
the
bridge
of
the
vouga
which
he
should
destroy
and
from
thence
on
oporto
the
enemy
have
no
boats
and
i
hope
to
be
able
to
press
them
so
hard
that
they
can
get
none
on
the
mondego
if
the
enemy
should
turn
toward
vizeu
you
will
of
course
do
all
that
you
can
to
annoy
them
in
their
march
but
send
all
your
baggage
across
the
vii
p
meanwhile
the
original
movement
of
reynier
junot
and
loison
towards
thomar
had
caused
wellington
to
spread
his
pursuing
troops
more
towards
the
east
than
was
convenient
when
it
turned
out
that
only
reynier
was
taking
the
mountain
road
towards
espinhal
and
that
the
other
columns
were
going
to
join
ney
on
the
road
originally
only
the
light
division
and
pack
s
portuguese
had
followed
ney
and
they
formed
the
only
body
of
troops
available
for
the
pursuit
of
what
was
now
detected
to
be
the
largest
body
of
the
enemy
until
the
other
divisions
should
come
up
from
the

be
marched

nothing

the

the

a

an

picture
of
what
the
british
army
saw
at
the
entrance
of
a
cave
he
writes
lay
an
old
man
a
woman
and
two
young
men
all
dead
the
cave
no
doubt
had
served
them
as
an
asylum
in
the
preceding
winter
and
appearances
warranted
the
supposition
that
these
poor
creatures
in
a
vain
effort
to
save
their
little
store
of
provisions
fell
victims
to
the
ferocity
of
their
murderers
the
clothes
of
the
young
peasants
were
torn
to
atoms
and
bore
testimony
that
they
did
not
lose
their
lives
without
a
struggle
the
hands
of
one
were
dreadfully
mangled
as
if
in
his
last
efforts
he
had
grasped
the
sword
which
ultimately
dispatched
him
beside
him
lay
his
companion
his
brother
perhaps
covered
with
wounds
a
little
to
the
right
was
the
old
man
he
lay
on
his
back
with
his
breast
bare
two
large
wounds
were
over
his
heart
and
the
back
of
his
head
was
beaten
to
pieces
near
him
lay
an
old
rusty
bayonet
lashed
to
a
pole
one
of
his
hands
grasped
a
bunch
of
hair
torn
no
doubt
from
the
head
of
his
assassin
the
old
woman
had
probably
been
strangled
as
no
wound
appeared
on
her
body
at
some
distance
from
the
spot
were
two
wounded
soldiers
of
the
french
léger
abandoned
by
their
comrades
these
poor
wretches
were
surrounded
by
half
a
dozen
portuguese
who
were
taking
on
them
the
horrible
vengeance
common
during
this
contest
on
our
approach
they
dispersed
and
fled
both
the
frenchmen
were
still
alive
and
asked
us
to
shoot
them
we
dared
not
and
when
we
had
passed
on
we
could
perceive
the
peasants
descending
from
the

more
anxious

clear
that

ought
to
have
done

at
the
bridge
the
real
force
opposed
to
him
was
seven
battalions
of
militia
some
men
and
six
guns
this
was
the
last
day
on
which
it
would
have
been
possible
for
the
french
to
seize
coimbra
for
from
the
onward
wellington
was
pressing
them
so
hard
that
if
they
had
set
themselves
to
force
the
passage
and
had
succeeded
their
rearguard
and
probably
a
great
portion
of
their
main
body
would
have
been
destroyed
for
ney
with
all
his
tactical
skill
could
not
have
shaken
off
his
pursuers
in
such
a
way
as
to
allow
men
to
file
over
a
single
bridge
hastily
repaired
when
the
allies
were
in
hot
pursuit
the
french
engineers
indeed
reported
that
it
would
take
several
days
to
mend
the
bridge
even
when
the
portuguese
had
been
driven
away
from
the
further
bank
the
main
comment
suggested
by
all
this
is
that
since
masséna
was
intending
to
hold
out
on
the
mondego
and
to
occupy
its
northern
bank
according
to
his
own
dispatch
sent
to
napoleon
he
ought
to
have
taken
measures
to
secure
a
safe
passage
many
days
back
at
the
first
moment
when
his
retreat
began
on
the
of
march
part
of
the
mass
of
troops
accumulated
at
leiria
ought
to
have
marched
for
coimbra
on
march
it
was
altogether
too
late
to
send
a
mere
flying
cavalry
force
to
appear
in
front
of
the
place
on
march
some
french
authorities
favourable
to
masséna
assert
that
he
was
not
responsible
for
the
failure
to
occupy
coimbra
that
ney
on
the
had
been
told
to
send
marcognet
s
brigade
to
support
montbrun
who
said
that
he
could
not
succeed
without
infantry
help
pelet
sur
la
campagne
de
but
ney
it
is
said
would
not
detach
the
brigade
this
seems
most
improbable
for
junot
s
corps
which
was
in
ney
s
rear
and
five
miles
nearer
to
coimbra
would
have
been
the
natural
source
from
which
to
seek
for
infantry
supports
for
montbrun
and
masséna
does
not
accuse
ney
of
this
particular
piece
of
disobedience
in
his
report
to
berthier
of
march
nor
in
the
later
one
of
march
when
he
is
giving
his
reasons
for
superseding
his
colleague
and
sending
him
home
to
france
he
simply
says
in
recounting
his
reasons
for
not
seizing
coimbra
that
montbrun
and
the
engineers
reported
that
the
river
was
in
flood
that
the
bridge
had
two
arches
broken
that
the
left
bank
was
occupied
by
the
forces
of
trant
and
silveira
and
defended
by
cannon
it
would
have
required
several
days
to
repair
the
bridge
and
to
drive
the
portuguese
out
of
coimbra
there
was
no
pontoon
train
with
the
army
and
not
a
single
boat
on
the
mondego
in
face
of
the
danger
of
being
attacked
by
wellington
s
whole
force
while
the
passage
was
in
progress
he
resolved
to
renounce
the
one
battalion
of
infantry
which
was
sent
to
montbrun
s
aid
on
the
came
from
solignac
s
division
in
junot
s
corps
as
might
have
been
expected
on
march
montbrun
was
prowling
ineffectively
along
the
south
bank
of
the
mondego
and
setting
his
horse
artillery
to
engage
in
a
futile
exchange
of
fire
with
trant
s
guns
while
a
battalion
of
infantry
borrowed
from
junot
tried
to
creep
upon
the
bridge
but
was
detected
and
driven
off
by
grape
but
ney
was
already
engaged
in
such
sharp
fighting
at
redinha
that
he
could
not
have
drawn
his
troops
off
or
have
escaped
towards
coimbra
even
if
the
passage
of
the
mondego
had
been
forced
wellington
it
will
be
remembered
was
advancing
towards
the
corps
in
the
morning
when
he
found
that
it
had
retired
from
venda
da
cruz
on
to
another
position
his
cavalry
discovered
that
not
only
was
he
in
presence
of
the
corps
but
that
another
french
column
was
on
his
flank
at
rabaçal
this
was
loison
s
division
moreover
the
corps
was
known
to
be
not
far
off
for
stragglers
and
sick
from
it
had
been
picked
up
upon
the
preceding
day
seeing
therefore
that
he
might
be
called
upon
to
face
some
men
the
british
general
resolved
not
to
open
the
fight
over
hastily
when
his
three
leading
columns
came
up
pack
in
the
centre
picton
on
the
right
the
light
division
on
the
left
they
were
halted
in
front
of
mermet
s
line
and
deployed
but
no
attack
was
made
till
the
division
had
reached
the
front
line
and
joined
pack
while
the
and
were
close
behind
then
at
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
an
encircling
attack
was
made
on
mermet
s
rearguard
the
wings
being
thrown
forward
while
the
centre
was
somewhat
held
back
the
division
entering
the
woods
on
the
french
left
the
light
division
those
on
their
right
advanced
as
quickly
as
they
could
through
difficult
ground
pack
and
the
division
halted
beyond
of
the
centre
but
suffered
a
little
from
artillery
fire
while
waiting
for
the
flank
attacks
to
develop
after
some
twenty
minutes
of
hot
skirmishing
among
the
trees
mermet
s
flanks
were
turned
by
picton
on
the
side
of
the
hills
and
by
the
light
division
on
the
side
of
the
plain
and
ney
hastily
drew
back
his
front
line
behind
the
stream
and
the
defile
where
marchand
s
division
was
waiting
in
support
the
retreating
battalions
were
somewhat
jammed
at
the
bridge
and
lost
heavily
while
passing
it
only
a
few
yards
in
front
of
the
skirmishers
of
the
light
division
picton
tried
to
ford
the
stream
higher
up
in
order
to
cut
off
the
retreating
force
before
it
could
reach
its
supports
but
failed
the
water
turning
out
too
deep
and
rapid
for
passage
i
spent
two
interesting
hours
at
redinha
on
september
going
round
the
guided
by
reynolds
of
barreiro
the
village
is
most
irregularly
built
and
the
way
to
the
bridge
not
obvious
the
streets
being
tortuous
and
narrow
the
place
is
easy
to
defend
but
not
easy
to
get
out
of
a
courteous
denizen
of
redinha
leitão
presented
me
with
an
unexploded
british
shrapnel
shell
which
he
had
got
out
of
the
sand
of
the
just
above
the
bridge
several
more
had
been
found
on
this
spot
they
must
have
been
thrown
by
the
pursuing
british
artillery
at
the
french
column
hurrying
over
the
bridge
and
had
fallen
short
into
the
water
each
contained
balls
but
the
powder
had
decayed
into
an
impalpable
red
dust
the
shell
that
we
got
is
now
in
the
united
service
museum
it
took
some
time
to
file
the
light
and
divisions
over
the
bridge
and
to
make
a
new
line
in
face
of
ney
s
second
position
on
the
ridge
two
miles
beyond
the
stream
but
when
the
two
divisions
once
more
went
forward
each
turning
as
before
the
enemy
s
flank
opposed
to
it
while
pack
and
the
division
formed
up
again
in
the
centre
ney
gave
back
without
any
very
strenuous
resistance
and
abandoning
his
second
position
fell
back
upon
condeixa
a
village
with
a
defile
in
front
of
it
five
miles
north
of
redinha
on
the
great
coimbra
the
day
s
work
had
been
a
very
pretty
piece
of
manœuvring
on
both
sides
ney
hung
on
to
his
two
successive
positions
just
so
long
as
was
safe
and
absconded
on
each
occasion
at
the
critical
moment
when
his
flanks
were
turned
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
more
delay
would
have
been
ruin
but
the
retreat
was
made
just
in
time
the
two
stands
had
delayed
wellington
for
a
day
and
his
army
had
only
advanced
ten
miles
in
the
hours
yet
it
is
unjust
to
accuse
the
british
general
of
as
napier
and
all
the
french
annalists
have
done
he
was
quite
right
not
to
attack
with
the
first
division
that
came
up
and
to
wait
till
he
had
three
and
a
half
in
line
for
he
was
aware
that
great
strength
lay
in
front
of
him
and
for
all
he
knew
the
troops
of
mermet
might
have
been
supported
not
only
by
marchand
as
was
actually
the
case
but
by
the
whole
of
junot
s
corps
in
that
case
an
early
attack
would
have
meant
a
bloody
check
and
an
enforced
wait
till
the
and
divisions
should
have
come
up
as
it
was
the
french
rearguard
was
dislodged
with
a
very
modest
loss
on
the
part
of
the
allies
officers
and
men
of
whom
the
large
majority
were
in
the
light
and
divisions
the
troops
which
had
done
the
work
but
the
division
and
pack
s
portuguese
suffered
some
casualties
while
waiting
under
for
the
flanking
movement
to
take
effect
the
french
loss
was
officers
and
men
nearly
all
from
mermet
s
division
as
that
of
marchand
was
little
engaged
see
table
of
losses
in
appendix
iii
of
the
regiments
the
chief
losers
were
the
men
and
men
of
the
fourteen
french
officers
killed
and
wounded
no
less
than
thirteen
were
from
the
léger
and
and
ligne
of
mermet
s
division
during
this
day
the
division
moving
apart
from
the
rest
of
the
army
marched
to
souré
and
so
got
upon
the
western
route
to
coimbra
it
was
apparently
wellington
s
intention
to
push
this
detachment
round
the
western
or
seaward
flank
of
the
french
army
so
as
to
threaten
with
it
the
right
wing
of
any
position
that
the
enemy
might
take
up
across
the
coimbra
indeed
having
found
no
hostile
force
of
any
sort
in
front
of
it
the
division
was
able
to
push
in
quite
close
to
coimbra
on
the
next
day
and
to
take
up
a
position
at
ega
which
menaced
ney
and
junot
s
march
across
its
front
if
they
should
still
continue
their
retreat
in
the
original
direction
it
was
probably
the
movement
of
this
division
which
caused
the
french
to
believe
that
wellington
had
landed
a
detached
force
from
ships
at
the
mouth
of
the
mondego
and
was
pushing
it
forward
towards
coimbra
an
account
of
the
march
of
this
imaginary
corps
is
to
be
found
in
several
narratives
in
delagrave
deux
colonnes
des

le

le

déborder
et

also
speaks
of
this
imaginary
force
condeixa
to
which
ney
had
retired
on
the
evening
of
the
combat
of
redinha
is
a
most
important
strategical
point
since
here
the
leading
to
coimbra
is
joined
by
the
last
crossroad
which
meets
it
south
of
the
mondego
that
which
runs
eastward
to
the
ponte
de
murcella
and
the
spanish
frontier
as
long
as
the
french
held
condeixa
they
were
in
a
position
to
choose
between
an
attack
on
coimbra
and
a
retreat
up
the
south
bank
of
the
river
towards
almeida
and
their
base
and
with
wellington
at
his
heels
masséna
had
now
to
make
his
choice
between
the
two
courses
his
dispatch
of
march
to
berthier
informs
us
that
he
resolved
for
a
moment
to
offer
battle
to
the
allies
at
condeixa
with
the
and
corps
calling
in
perhaps
though
he
does
not
mention
it
the
corps
from
espinhal
which
is
no
more
than
twenty
miles
away
the
reasons
which
he
gives
for
not
doing
so
are
firstly
that
since
the
departure
of
drouet
and
his
division
on
the
his
whole
force
was
no
more
than
half
that
of
wellington
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
had
still
men
his
adversary
just
about
the
same
number
secondly
that
the
morale
of
the
army
was
impaired
by
long
privations
and
short
rations
thirdly
that
the
stock
of
ammunition
was
dangerously
low
and
the
artillery
horses
could
hardly
move
fourthly
that
he
was
hampered
by
the
fact
that
his
lieutenants
he
is
alluding
to
ney
in
especial
were
set
on
abandoning
portugal
which
contributes
in
no
small
degree
to
a
lack
of
that
harmony
which
ought
to
reign
in
an
fifthly
that
a
defeat
at
condeixa
would
mean
the
inevitable
loss
of
all
his
artillery
train
wounded
and
baggage
while
a
success
would
not
seriously
injure
wellington
who
could
always
retire
on
to
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
sixthly
that
being
in
the
midst
of
a
population
roused
to
fury
by
the
ravages
of
his
army
he
found
that
he
could
gather
in
little
or
no
food
and
was
fast
using
up
the
stock
that
he
had
brought
with
him
taking
all
these
points
into
consideration
and
being
informed
by
montbrun
that
even
if
he
succeeded
in
seizing
coimbra
its
bridge
would
take
two
days
to
repair
he
had
resolved
to
avoid
a
general
action
to
abandon
any
attempt
to
pass
the
mondego
and
to
draw
back
towards
the
corps
and
the
spanish
frontier
where
he
could
find
the
food
and
the
new
equipment
which
the
army
needed
illustration
redinha
accordingly
on
the
early
morning
of
march
the
decisive
step
which
committed
masséna
to
a
retreat
towards
celorico
and
the
corps
was
taken
the
corps
was
marched
off
covering
the
train
along
the
road
which
leads
by
miranda
de
corvo
to
the
ponte
de
murcella
and
the
upper
mondego
instead
of
toward
coimbra
now
only
eight
miles
away
to
cover
its
flank
loison
s
division
was
moved
from
rabaçal
where
it
had
lain
on
the
day
of
the
combat
of
redinha
to
fonte
cuberta
ney
remained
behind
at
condeixa
with
his
two
old
divisions
to
cover
the
fork
of
the
roads
and
to
detain
the
allies
as
long
as
possible
while
junot
and
the
trains
were
toiling
along
the
bad
and
mountainous
road
towards
miranda
de
corvo
the
corps
was
still
kept
at
espinhal
where
it
was
observed
by
nightingale
s
brigade
which
had
dogged
its
steps
at
a
cautious
distance
since
the
these
arrangements
did
not
work
very
well
for
ney
was
turned
out
of
the
condeixa
position
much
earlier
than
he
or
masséna
had
expected
by
wellington
s
skilful
manœuvres
the
movement
used
against
him
was
much
the
same
as
at
redinha
the
division
marched
by
a
mountain
path
to
turn
his
left
while
the
division
coming
in
from
souré
by
a
wide
sweep
appeared
at
ega
almost
behind
his
right
wing
and
threatened
to
get
between
him
and
coimbra
meanwhile
the
and
light
divisions
with
the
rest
of
the
army
behind
them
were
halted
on
distant
heights
in
his
front
ready
to
attack
when
the
turning
movements
should
become
pronounced
ney
was
very
properly
anxious
about
his
retreat
for
he
could
not
any
longer
as
at
pombal
and
redinha
give
back
to
his
rear
but
was
forced
to
take
a
side
direction
in
order
to
follow
the
corps
on
the
miranda
de
corvo
road
the
moment
that
he
saw
picton
making
for
this
road
to
cut
him
off
from
the
rest
of
the
french
he
set
fire
to
the
town
of
condeixa
and
moved
off
in
great
haste
just
avoiding
picton
to
casal
novo
a
village
five
miles
east
of
his
first
position
where
he
formed
up
again
at
dusk
the
day
s
operations
had
been
almost
bloodless
nothing
more
than
a
few
musket
shots
were
exchanged
by
the
skirmishers
of
the
two
sides
but
they
had
been
of
the
highest
strategical
importance
since
they
ended
in
the
complete
abandonment
of
the
attempt
to
reach
coimbra
by
the
french
incidentally
the
rapid
fashion
in
which
ney
had
been
evicted
from
the
at
condeixa
nearly
led
to
disaster
some
of
the
outlying
fractions
of
the
french
army
masséna
himself
had
halted
at
fonte
cuberta
six
miles
to
the
with
his
staff
and
loison
s
division
which
was
escorting
the
reserve
artillery
of
the
and
corps
he
was
intending
to
cover
ney
s
left
from
any
wide
turning
movement
by
the
british
the
road
on
which
this
village
lies
falls
into
that
from
condeixa
to
miranda
de
corvo
about
three
miles
from
the
place

the

fell
into

masséna

the

in

company
were
therefore
cut
off
from
their
proper
route
for
retiring
on
to
the
main
army
within
a
few
minutes
after
the
arrival
of
ney
s
messenger
a
patrol
of
the
german
hussars
arrived
at
the
village
and
nearly
rode
into
masséna
and
his
staff
who
were
dining
in
the
open
air
under
a
tree
outside
its
entrance
there
was
a
mutual
surprise
the
marshal
s
escort
of
fifty
men
ran
to
their
arms
while
the
hussars
halted
not
understanding
what
they
had
come
upon
if
they
had
charged
masséna
might
have
been
taken
or
slain
as
several
french
narrators
assert
he
mounted
and
galloped
back
in
haste
towards
loison
s
infantry
who
were
camped
in
and
beyond
the
village
the
hussars
went
off
to
report
to
their
squadron
commander
that
fonte
cuberta
was
still
occupied
it
had
been
with
the
object
of
obtaining
information
on
this
point
that
the
reconnaissance
had
been
sent
out
masséna
hastened
to
put
loison

men
under

for
casal

by
a
very
rugged
called
up
clausel
s
division
to
cover
him
and
got
off
in
the
dusk
unhindered
save
by
a
few
flank
skirmishers
belonging
to
picton
s
division
who
came
upon
him
in
the
dark
and
were
brushed
away
with
ease
marbot
says
that
the
officer
arrived
four
hours
after
the
evacuation
of
condeixa
though
that
place
is
only
five
miles
from
fonte
cuberta
ii
fririon
makes
a
much
graver
accusation
against
ney
viz
that
he
sent
no
messenger
at
all
and
that
the
allied
cavalry
were
discovered
by
an
officer
named
girbault
on
masséna
s
staff
for
an
account
of
this
curious
affair
see
fririon
noël
who
was
with
loison
at
the
moment
pelet
and
marbot
the
latter
as
always
gives
the
most
picturesque
and
probably
the
least
trustworthy
account
he
forgets
to
mention
that
fonte
cuberta
was
occupied
by
loison
s
infantry
and
writes
as
if
a
squadron
of
hussars
had
retired
before
masséna
s
escort
of
men
according
to
him
the
marshal
s
was
much
disturbed
by
the
misadventures
of
his
mistress
renique
s
sister
whose
horse
repeatedly
fell
in
the
dark
and
rolled
over
her
to
his
intense
anxiety

this
incident
led
to
a
furious
quarrel
between
masséna
and
ney
for
the
former
asserted
as
it
seems
that
the
latter
had
promised
to
hold
condeixa
for
a
whole
day
or
more
and
had
moved
off
at
noon
out
of
mere
malice
so
as
to
leave
his
chief
in
an
exposed
position
if
we
may
believe
the
narrative
of
masséna
s
fririon
he
asserted
that
ney
had
deliberately
wished
to
get
him
captured
and
had
executed
his
retreat
clandestinement
it
was
impossible
to
persuade
him
to
the
contrary
and
he
saved
up
his
wrath
for
the
next
occasion
when
he
should
be
able
to
convict
ney
of
open
disobedience
and
not
of
mere
errors
of
judgement
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
doing
an
injustice
to
his
lieutenant
in
suspecting
him
of
such
a
monstrous
plot
ney
was
a
man
of
honour
masséna
had
himself
such
a
doubtful
record
for
probity
that
we
can
well
understand
his
suspicion
of
others
in
truth
what
happened
was
that
the
younger
marshal
had
promised
to
defend
condeixa
longer
than
was
really
possible
when
wellington
as
on
this
day
was
in
his
happiest
mood
and
manœuvring
with
a
skill
which
made
a
long
resistance
impracticable

pp
but
loison
s
division
was
not
the
only
french
force
which
was
in
serious
danger
on
march
montbrun
had
lingered
in
front
of
coimbra
till
his
retreat
also
was
imperilled
by
the
loss
of
condeixa
and
its
bifurcation
of
roads
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
had
made
his
last
vain
attempt
to
win
his
way
into
the
city
this
time
by
negotiation
he
sent
a
on
to
the
broken
bridge
with
a
demand
that
trant
should
give
up
the
place
and
a
promise
that
the
citizens
should
suffer
no
harm
and
the
garrison
should
be
allowed
free
egress
this
last
was
really
not
his
to
grant
for
during
the
night
trant
had
removed
everything
from

city

a

of

very
properly
preserved
adroitly

time
by
detaining
the
french
officer
he
told
him
that
he
must
wait
till
an
answer
came
from
trant
whose
absence
he
kept
concealed
and
then
after
some
hours
said
that
his
commander
had
gone
to
visit
a
distant
point
of
the
river
defences
from
which
he
would
not
be
back
till
the
next
morning
meanwhile
if
any
attempt
were
made
to
attack
the
bridge
he
had
orders
to
blow
up
several
more
arches
which
were
mined
time
drifted
on
and
meanwhile
montbrun
received
at
noon
the
news
that
ney
was
forced
to
give
up
condeixa
that
there
was
no
more
prospect
of
using
coimbra
as
a
moreover
his
own
retreat
was
in
danger
if
an
english
detachment
should
march
straight
from
condeixa
towards
the
bridge
a
distance
of
only
eight
miles
the
french
general
was
obliged
to
abscond
and
the
only
route
open
to
him
since
the
was
lost
was
a
rough
path
which
after
coasting
along
the
south
bank
of
the
mondego
for
some
time
turns
up
into
the
valley
of
the
eça
and
so
reaches
miranda
de
corvo
after
blowing
up
many
of
his
wheeled
vehicles
montbrun
hastened
to
take
this
track
and
escaped
by
it
though
he
was
discovered
and
pursued
by
some
of
wellington
s
cavalry
patrols
who
pressed
his
rearguard
and
made
many
prisoners
but
the
division
of
dragoons
with
the
infantry
battalion
attached
and
the
two
horse
artillery
batteries
their
caissons
had
to
be
destroyed

of
the
badness
of
the
road
ultimately
reached
miranda
with
no
great
loss
for
all
this
see
soriano
da
luz
iii
pp
according
to
delagrave
he
got
the
news
neither
from
ney
nor
from
an
of
his
own
whom
he
had
left
with
the
corps
to
transmit
information
but
from
an
emissary
of
masséna
named
girod
who
thought
of
him
when
the
proper
authorities
failed
to
do
so
called
the
deuça
by
napier
and
other
writers
an
erroneous
contraction
of
rio
de
eça
this
was
a
truly
important
day
the
most
critical
in
the
whole
campaign
since
at
its
end
coimbra
was
safe
and
the
whole
french
army
had
been
turned
on
to
the
road
towards
spain
wellington
was
satisfied
and
had
no
reason
to
be
otherwise
the
accusation
made
against
him
by
many
critics
of
which
is
said
to
have
prevented
him
from
destroying
loison
s
and
montbrun
s
detachments
seems
unjustifiable
the
cardinal
fact
that
he
was
not
superior
in
numerical
strength
to
the
army
that
he
was
pursuing
is
too
often
forgotten
indeed
the
french
writers
from
masséna
down
to
have
nearly
always
credited
him
with
or
men
whereas
he
had
barely
of
whom
only
were
british
and
the
portuguese
were
still
in
great
part
untried
troops
for
though
those
of
them
who
had
passed
the
test
of
battle
pack
s
and
power
s
brigades
the
caçadores
in
the
light
division
and
the
artillery
had
done
admirably
hitherto
there
were
still
four
whole
brigades
which
had
never
been
in
serious
action
since
they
were
reorganized
in
nothing
was
to
be
risked
and
partial
attacks
by
unsupported
vanguards
were
to
be
eschewed
when
as
wellington
remarked
in
his
dispatch
of
march
the
whole
country
affords
advantageous
positions
to
a
retreating
army
of
which
the
enemy
has
shown
that
he
knows
how
to
avail
himself
they
are
leaving
the
country
as
they
entered
it
in
one
solid
mass
covering
their
rear
on
every
march
by
one
or
sometimes
two
d
in
the
successive
positions
which
the
country
affords
which
d
are
closely
supported
by
the
a
general
action
against
equal
or
superior
numbers
ranged
on
a
strong
was
clearly
inadvisable
and
the
plan
of
manœuvring
the
enemy
out
of
each
line
that
he
took
up
by
a
short
flanking
movement
was
infinitely
preferable
flanking
movements
take
time
and
unless
the
enemy
is
very
slow
or
very
rash
have
effective
rather
than
brilliant
results
but
wellington
never
played
to
the
gallery
he
was
no
vendor
of
bulletins
he
had
a
small
army
which
it
was
difficult
to
reinforce
and
he
could
not
afford
to
waste
his
precious
men
in
hazardous
combats
it
would
have
been
of
little
profit
to
him
if
he
had
destroyed
a
division
or
two
of
the
enemy
and
had
then
arrived
on
the
spanish
frontier
with
an
army
diminished
by
men
the
enemy
had
unlimited
supports
behind
him
he
had
practically
none
for
when
he
had
taken
out
his
field

had
detached

were
no

check
which
it
was

lost
more
men
than
on

day

eventful
month

the

holding

defiling
along

some
distance
off

along

from

division
had
to
extend
and
fight
hard
in
order
to
keep
its
ground
while
the
main
body
was
coming
up
and
developing
a
flanking
movement
against
the
french
it
lost
heavily
of
necessity
and
was
only
released
from
a
dangerous
position
by
the
movement
of
picton
and
the
division
to
the
right
which
forced
the
french
to
abscond

fell
back
behind

was
in
position
two
miles
to
the
rear

this

was
properly
turned
and
carried
without

with
some
delay

discovered
in
the
afternoon
in
a
third
and
still
more
formidable

coming
up
from

then
gave
up
his
position
and
fell
back
six
miles
down

towards

the
banks
of

waiting
for

out
by
a
running
fight
of
twelve
hours
during
which
they
had
gained
fourteen
miles
of
ground
halted
in

of

their
loss
had
been
officers
and
men
in
the
british
and
in
the
portuguese
ranks
a
total
of
more
than
half
fell
in
the
mismanaged
business
of
the
early
morning
in
which
the
and
lost
officers
and
over
men
in
an
utterly
unnecessary
combat
this
was
the
first
of
two
exhibitions
of
wrongheadedness
by
which
the
newly
arrived
general
william
erskine
lost
wellington
s
confidence
the
second
on
april
was
as
we
shall
see
to
be
a
still
more
discreditable
affair
the
french
loss
at
casal
novo
and
in
the
succeeding
skirmishes
of
the
day
was
apparently
much
smaller
than
that
of
the
british
though
the
official
figure
of
killed
and
wounded
seems
very
low
on
this
morning
the
british
for
the
first
time
during
the
retreat
began
to
take
prisoners
on
a
considerable
scale
there
were
more
than
captured
between
casal
novo
and
miranda
de
corvo
partly
skirmishers
cut
off
during
the
long
bickering
in
woods
and
enclosures
which
filled
the
day
partly
stragglers
and
marauders
who
were
taken
in
the
while
wandering
away
from
their
colours

walked
round
casal

on
september
it
is
a
very
small
place
under
a
low
undulation
of
the
plateau
which
the
road
crosses
there
is
a
good
account
of
the
combat
of
casal

in
william
napier
s
iii
and
a
still
more
striking
one
in
his
biography
pp
containing
some
distressing
anecdotes
he
was
severely
wounded
as
was
also
his
brother
george
napier
of
the
whose
narrative
is
quite
as
interesting
as
william
s
it
is
he
who
describes
erskine
s
reckless
action
best
informed
by
colonel
ross
that
the
french
were
still
in
casal
novo
he
kept
blustering
and
swearing
it
was
all
nonsense
that
the
captains
of
the
pickets
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
and
that
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
village
just
as
he
spoke
the
dense
fog
began
to
clear
and
bang
came
a
shot
from
a
which
struck
the
head
of
our
column
and
made
a
lane
through
it
killing
and
wounding
many
then
came
a
regular
cannonade
but
the
wise
sir
william
was
sure
it
was
but
a
single
gun
and
a
picket
supporting
it
and
desired
colonel
ross
to
send
my
company
against
its
flank

the
has
also

a
very
good
and
lively
narrative
of

day

work

losses
of
the

unfortunately
got
mixed

and
names
have
not
got
wrong
we
know
that
on
the
the
regiment
had
officers
wounded
and
more
at
foz
do
arouce
on
the
following
day
but
in
the
ligne
colonel
lamour
is
down
as
blessé
le
mars
à
condeixa
while
he
was
certainly
wounded
at
foz
do
arouce
on
the
where
he
was
also
taken
prisoner
the
total
of
officers
recorded
as
hit
in
the
corps
on
the
is
of
whom
were
certainly
casualties
of
the
this
must
surely
imply
more
than
in
all
killed
and
wounded
at
the
low
rate
of
men
per
officer
it
would
give
at
the
normal
rate
of
per
officer
it
would
be
but
the
last
is
probably
too
high
it
was
on
this
day
that
marbot
had
his
famous
encounter
with
a
rifle
officer
de
chasseurs
à
and
two
hussars
of
whom
according
to
his
narrative
he
slew
the
first
and
wounded
the
other
two
it
can
not
be
disputed
that
he
had
a
fight
for
he
is
down
as
wounded
in
the
official
lists
but
he
certainly
did
not
kill
a
rifle
officer
the
only
light
division
officer
slain
that
day
was
lieutenant
gifford
who
was
killed
by
a
ball
in
the
head
at
casal
novo
it
is
also
to
be
noted
that
there
are
no
cavalry
casualties
in
the
return
of
march
or
indeed
since
redinha
marbot
s
supposed
victims
thus
disappear
on
this
evening
reynier
and
the
corps
so
long
divided
from
the
rest
of
the
french
army
joined
the
main
column
from
march
to
march
they
had
lain
at
espinhal
resting
after
the
difficult
passage
of
the
mountains
and
endeavouring
without
much
success
to
scrape
together
food
to
fill
their
depleted
stores
being
closely
observed
though
not
attacked
by
nightingale
s
brigade
they
could
not
scatter
very
far
for
marauding
but
on
the
wellington
during
the
casal
novo
fighting
threw
out
cole
s
division
far
to
his
right
to
penella
where
it
got
into
touch
with
nightingale
seeing
that
there
was
now
a
serious
force
in
front
of
reynier
and
that
it
might
thrust
itself
between
him
and
the
rest
of
the
army
masséna
bade
his
lieutenant
break
up
without
delay
and
come
in
to
miranda
de
corvo
this
was
easily
done
by
a
march
in
the
afternoon
and
the
corps
camped
on
the
further
side
of
the
eça
river
that
night
thus
the
whole
french
army
save
conroux
s
division
was
concentrated
and
men
under
arms
dragging
behind
them
a
that
was
still
considerable
and
over
sick
and
wounded
were
gathered
in
the
defile
and
the
little
plain
north
of
it
with
a
most
forbidding
mountain
range
in
their
front
and
the
pursuing
columns
of
wellington
in
their
rear
the
situation
appeared
so
grave
to
masséna
that
he
resolved
to
lighten
his
army
so
far
as
was
possible
in
order
to
allow
it
to
march
faster
on
this
night
there
was
a
general
destruction
not
only
of
all
wheeled
vehicles
save
a
minimum
of
ammunition
waggons
but
of
all
the
baggage
of
the
army
regimental
as
well
as
personal
ney
set
the
example
by
burning
his
own
carriages
and
abandoning
all
that
could
not
be
carried
on
pack
mules
the
sick
and
wounded
were
transferred
from
waggons
on
to
beasts
of
burden
a
change
which
caused
the
death
or
abandonment
of
many
hundreds
of
them
during
the
next
two
days
a
strict
inspection
was
made
of
all
the
surviving
draught
and
pack
animals
and
when
those
still
in
a
fair
state
had
been
set
aside
for
the
carriage
of
the
sick
and
the
ammunition
an
order
was
issued
that
all
the
rest
should
be
put
to
death
to
avoid
the
noise
which
would
have
been
caused
by
shooting
them
the
officer
charged
with
this
duty
caused
them
all
to
be
hamstrung
a
cruel
device
which
was
surely
unnecessary
for
they
could
have
been
killed
as
easily
as
mutilated
by
the
sword
or
knife
the
horrid
sight
of
more
than
live
horses
mules
and
asses
sprawling
or
hobbling
in
a
bleeding
mass
just
outside
the
village
of
miranda
de
corvo
was
never
forgotten
by
those
who
witnessed
it
in
the
pursuit
of
the
following
morning
for
details
see
the
diary
of
ney
s
sprünglin
it
is
astounding
to
find
masséna
in
his
dispatch
of
march
to
berthier
stating
that
between
miranda
de
corvo
and
foz
do
arouce
nos
équipages
et
nos
malades
ne
cessaient
pas
de
filer
et
rien
absolument
n
est
resté
en
the
most
disgusting
sight
was
the
asses
floundering
in
the
mud
some
with
throats
half
cut
the
rest
barbarously
houghed
what
the
object
of
this
was
i
never
could
guess
the
poor
brutes
could
have
been
of
no
use
to
us
for
they
could
not
have
travelled
another
league
their
meagre
appearance
with
backbones
and
hips
protruding
through
their
skin
and
their
mangled
limbs
produced
a
feeling
of
disgust
and
grattan
p
it
was
pitiable
to
see
the
poor
creatures
in
this
state
yet
there
was
something
ludicrous
in
the
position
which
many
had
taken
when
thus
cruelly
lamed
they
were
sitting
in
groups
upon
their
hinder
ends
staring
in
each
other
s
faces
as
if
in
deep
consultation
on
some
important
donaldson
of
the
p
the
sacrifice
of
the
baggage
was
the
preliminary
to
a
desperate
and
fatiguing
night
march
the
corps
started
off
first
then
the
leaving
the
as
usual
to
bring
up
the
rear
after
firing
miranda
de
corvo
in
order
that
the
conflagration
in
the
narrow
street
leading
up
from
the
bridge
might
delay
the
advance
of
the
allies
ney
followed
the
rest
of
the
army
at
one
in
the
morning
all
marched
slowly
in
the
dark
for
ten
miles
of
an
uphill
road
and
before
noon
reached
the
long
descent
into
the
valley
of
the
ceira
at
the
village
of
foz
do
arouce
the
and
corps
crossed
the
stream
with
much
delay
at
a
bridge
which
had
been
somewhat
injured
by
the
local
ordenança
but
was
still
serviceable
they
deployed
on
a
range
of
commanding
heights
on
the
further
side
and
encamped
ney
always
eager
to
carry
on
the
detaining
process
which
he
had
hitherto
practised
with
such
skill
only
sent
three
of
his
six
brigades
across
the
river
though
masséna
had
ordered
him
to
pass
and
to
destroy
the
bridge
he
remained
with
the
rest
and
lamotte
s
light
cavalry
posted
on
two
long
hills
with
the
village
of
foz
between
them
on
the
hither
side
of
the
water
though
he
had
a
good
position
yet
the
defile
to
the
rear
was
a
dangerous
thing
for
such
a
large
body
of
troops
since
the
ceira
was
in
flood
and
every
man
had
to
retire
over
the
single
damaged
bridge
moreover
the
troops
tired
by
the
night
march
guarded
themselves
badly
in
especial
the
cavalry
which
ought
to
have
watched
every
road
with
vedettes
out
for
many
miles
to
the
front
huddled
together
near
the
river
for
the
convenience
of
water
and
grazing
general
lamotte
indeed
crossed
the
ceira
with
great
part
of
his
men
and
seems
to
have
kept
no
whatever
napier
calls
the
village
foz
de
aronce
and
this
spelling
of
it
probably
caused
by
an
uncorrected
printer
s
error
has
been
perpetuated
by
every
english
writer
on
the
war
yet
wellington
has
it
rightly
spelt
with
the
u
in
his
dispatch
vii
as
foz
de
masséna
in
his
calls
it
foz
d
arunce
which
is
incorrect
delagrave
fririon
and
other
french
narrators
follow
him
sometimes
with
the
variants
aronce
or
arounce
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
name
is
spelt
with
a
u
and
always
has
been
by
the
portuguese
all
marchand
s
division
and
a
brigade
of
mermet
s

behind

i
studied
the
ground
at

do
arouce
on
september
the
bridge
is
only
four
and
a
half
yards
broad
and
long
it
was
approached
in
by
the
road
in
a
sharp
turn
which
has
now
been
straightened
out
so
was
far
more
difficult
to
cross
than
it
is
now
the
gap
between
the
hills
in
which
the
village
lies
is
about
yards
broad
the
heights
on
the
french
left
are
much
higher
than
those
on
their
right
wellington
s
pursuit
this
morning
started
very
late
the
burning
of
the
french
baggage
and
of
the
town
of
miranda
had
been
noted
in
the
last
hours
of
the
night
but
at
dawn
a
heavy
fog
arose
and
wellington
refused
to
move
his
masses
till
it
was
certain
that
the
french
were
not
still
in
position
on
the
heights
beyond
the
river
with
all
their
men
for
if
masséna
were
seeking
a
battle
as
was
quite
possible
now
that
he
had
concentrated
all
his
three
corps
it
would
be
reckless
to
attack
him
when
every
man
of
the
allied
army
had
to
file
over
a
narrow
bridge
it
was
not
till
reconnaissances
had
pushed
across
the
eça
and
had
explored
the
burning
town
and
the
ground
beyond
for
some
miles
that
orders
were
issued
for
the
army
to
march
on
even
then
the
fog
had
not
lifted
and
the
morning
was
some
hours
old
before
the
and
light
divisions
were
on
their
way
they
followed
the
retreating
french
up
the
long
ascent
picking
up
many
sick
and
stragglers
and
at
about
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
came
in
sight
of
the
enemy
in
their
new
position
behind
the
ceira
with
a
formidable
front
extending
for
several
miles
along
the
hills
and
ney
s
rearguard
visible
on
the
lower
eminences
on
the
hither
side
of
the
stream
picton
and
erskine
halted
thinking
that
it
was
too
late
in
the
afternoon
to
undertake
a
serious
attack
and
that
wellington
would
wait
as
usual
for
his
supports
to
come
up
they
had
directed
their
divisions
to
encamp
and
thrown
out
their
pickets
when
the
rode
up
not
long
before
dusk
surveying
the
enemy
and
seeing
that
few
battalions
were
under
arms
and
that
ney
was
evidently
expecting
no
fighting
his
cavalry
indeed
had
given
him
no
proper
warning
of
the
approach
of
the
allies
wellington
resolved
to
strike
at
once
though
his
nearest
reserve
the
division
was
still
some
way
off
picton
was
told
to
attack
the
french
left
the
light
division
their
right
the
first
blow
was
very
effective
and
partook
of
the
nature
of
a
surprise
for
the
enemy
was
caught
unprepared
some
companies
of
the
rifles
penetrating
down
a
hollow
road
arrived
almost
unopposed
in
the
village
of
foz
quite
close
to
the
bridge
while
the
rest
of
the
light
division
was
holding
marchand
s
troops
engaged
in
a
frontal
fight
and
picton
was
making
good
way
against
the
brigade
belonging
to
mermet
which
formed
the
french
left
the
noise
of
close
combat
breaking
out
almost
in
their
rear
at
a
spot
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
bridge
was
in
danger
and
their
retreat
cut
off
caused
a
panic
in
the
french
and
the
regiment
broke
its
ranks
and
hurried
towards
the
bridge
where
it
met
and
became
jammed
against
lamotte
s
cavalry
who
were
hastily
returning
to
take
up
the
position
from
which
they
had
unwisely
retired
an
hour
or
two
before
finding
the
passage
impossible
the
fugitives
turned
to
a
deep
ford
a
little
and
plunged
into
it
where
many
were
drowned
and
the
regimental
eagle
was
lost
while
their
colonel
was
taken
prisoner
ney
saved
the
situation
which
had
arisen
through
his
own
disobedience
to
masséna
s
orders
by
charging
with
the
third
battalion
of
the
regiment
the
rifle
companies
which
had
got
into
foz
do
arouce
and
were
threatening
the
bridge
they
were
driven
back
on
to
their
support
the
regiment
and
the
passage
having
been
cleared
by
the
marshal
s
exertions
the
troops
to
the
left
and
right
crossed
it
in
some
disorder
and
took
refuge
on
the
opposite
bank
they
were
shelled
during
their
defile
not
only
by
ross
s
and
bull
s
horse
artillery
batteries
but
by
some
guns
belonging
to
their
own
corps
which
in
the
deepening
twilight
failed
to
distinguish
between
pursuers
and
pursued
by
the
time
that
night
had
fully
set
in
the
french
rearguard
was
all
over
the
river
and
the
bridge
was
blown
up
if
the
attack
had
been
delivered
an
hour
earlier
it
is
probable
that
ney
would
have
suffered
losses
far
greater
than
he
actually
endured
perhaps
men
killed
wounded
drowned
or
taken
for
the
british
divisions
were
prevented
by
the
failing
light
from
acting
as
effectively
as
they
otherwise
might
against
the
masses
hastily
recrossing
the
bridge
wellington
s
loss
was
trifling
officers
and
men
nearly
a
third
of
them
in
the
rifle
companies
which
had
broken
the
french
centre
for
a
moment
and
had
then
been
driven
back
by
ney
the
small
remainder
of
the
baggage
of
marchand
and
mermet
was
captured
on
this
occasion
including
some
biscuit
which
proved
most
grateful
to
the
light
division
as
it
had
like
the
rest
of
the
british
army
outmarched
its
transport
it
was
found
in
the
river
at
low
water
and
sent
to
london
the
loss
is
mentioned
in
george
simmons
s
diary
under
march
wellington
sent
it
home
in
july
viii
p
so
both
masséna
s
dispatch
and
fririon
who
was
present
with
the
brigade
of
which
the
formed
part
marbot
is
wrong
in
saying
that
it
was
the
all
the
narratives
on
the
french
side
are
very
confused
and
differ
widely
sprünglin
says
masséna
in
his
dispatch
to
berthier
under
marbot
et
sprünglin
as
ney
s
had
the
best
chance
of
knowing
but
martinien
s
lists
in
which
i
can
only
find
ten
or
twelve
casualties
among
officers
suggest
a
smaller
total
roughly
perhaps
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
note
that
the
combat
of
foz
do
arouce
bore
a
singular
resemblance
to
craufurd
s
combat
on
the
coa
of
july
in
each
case
a
rearguard
was
tempted
to
stay
too
long
beyond
an
unfordable
river
and
a
narrow
bridge
by
the
defensible
nature
of
the
position
in
which
it
found
itself
and
nearly
suffered
a
complete
disaster
the
only
difference
was
that
ney
had
at
least
double
as
strong
a
force
as
craufurd
and
had
also
a
whole
army
in
line
beyond
the
river
to
support
him
while
the
british
general
had
no
reserves
near
in
each
case
the
endangered
detachment
got
away
by
dint
of
hard
fighting
with
appreciable
but
by
no
means
crushing
losses
it
is
curious
that
the
tables
were
exactly
turned
between
pursuer
and
pursued
in
these
two
fights
in
it
was
ney
who
by
a
sudden
assault
hustled
the
light
division
over
the
coa
in
the
light
division
was
at
the
head
of
the
striking
force
which
thrust
ney
over
the
ceira
if
craufurd
had
been
in
command
instead
of
the
incapable
erskine
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
the
matter
would
have
been
pushed
to
a
more
decisive
conclusion
despite
of
the
dusk
illustration
foz
d
arouce
on
the
morning
of
march
the
hills
beyond
the
ceira
where
a
whole
army
had
been
visible
on
the
preceding
day
were
now
seen
to
be
almost
void
of
defenders
only
a
trifling
rearguard
was
visible
watching
the
broken
bridge
from
a
distance
wellington
sent
scouts
over
the
river
to
reconnoitre
but
did
not
cross
it
in
force
he
had
accomplished
his
main
design
of
thrusting
the
french
off
the
coimbra
road
and
into
the
mountains
and
he
had
entirely
outmarched
his
provisions
he
had
now
got
so
far
from
his
base
at
lisbon
that
food
sent
up
from
thence
had
far
to
travel
and
he
had
not
yet
succeeded
in
setting
up
an
intermediate
dépôt
at
coimbra
though
were
already
ordered
from
lisbon
to
its
port
of
figueira
now
that
there
was
no
danger
of
the
enemy
crossing
the
lower
mondego
during
the
last
week
the
army
had
used
up
all
that
it
carried
with
it
and
the
portuguese
brigades
badly
supplied
by
the
native
commissariat
had
run
short
even
before
the
british
pack
s
and
ashworth
s
men
had
received
no
regular
rations
for
four
days
and
had
only
kept
up
to
the
front
by
gleaning
in
the
deserted
bivouacs
of
the
french
and
borrowing
the
little
that
the
british
commissariat
could
spare
everything
had
run
dry
by
the
and
wellington
considered
that
no
great
harm
would
be
suffered
by
waiting
a
day
on
the
ceira
for
the
first
convoy
to
come
up
from
the
rear
since
the
french
were
now
in
rugged
ground
where
they
could
not
make
any
long
attempt
to
stand
for
sheer
want
of
food
they
must
continue
their
retreat
or
starve
in
a
depopulated
country
accordingly
wellington
settled
down
at
lousão
and
took
stock
of
the
general
position
of
affairs
the
result
of
his
halt
was
an
immense
discharge
of
arrears
of
correspondence
he
had
written
only
one
dispatch
between
the
and
of
march
but
got
off
seventeen
on
the
day
some
of
these
are
very
important
as
showing
that
he
regarded
the
crisis
as
over
and
the
ultimate
evacuation
of
portugal
by
the
french
as
certain
the
most
notable
are
two
orders
to
beresford
making
over
to
him
once
more
the
division
and
de
grey
s
heavy
dragoons
for
the
expedition
into
estremadura
which
now
had
as
its
object
not
the
relief
of
badajoz
whose
capitulation
was
known
but
the
holding
back
of
soult
from
campo
mayor
and
elvas
see
vii
there
is
a
bitter
letter
from
pack
of
march
in
his
concerning
the
bad
commissariat
and
worse
medical
establishment
of
an
inefficient
and
penniless
government
which
no
officer
can
serve
with
pleasure
or
advantage
which
quite
bears
out
wellington
vii
wellington
had
called
beresford
up
to
him
on
may
and
the
latter
was
present
at
pombal
and
redinha
he
rode
hastily
back
to
pick
up
his
forces
which
were
to
form
the
army
of
estremadura
on
the
and
reached
thomar
on
the
march
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
division
and
hamilton
s
portuguese
had
been
left
behind
near
abrantes
when
wellington
determined
on
march
not
to
send
an
expedition
against
soult
till
he
could
make
it
up
to
a
force
sufficient
to
cope
with
the
army
that
was
beleaguering
badajoz
they
were
not
to
commit
themselves
to
any
offensive
operations
or
to
cross
the
portuguese
frontier
till
the
reinforcements
arrived
but
were
to
move
a
stage
on
their
way
toward
the
south
accordingly
the
head
quarters
of
the
division
were
at
tramagal
on
the
with
its
attached
cavalry
the
light
dragoons
at
crato
in
advance
while
the
portuguese
horse
of
otway
had
been
sent
to
watch
the
roads
to
elvas
by
portalegre
and
estremos
here
there
was
a
halt
for
a
week
beresford
being
absent
with
wellington
for
five
days
and
it
was
not
till
the
that
the
movement
towards
estremadura
began
again
on
his
return
meanwhile
masséna
oddly
enough
knowing
of
the
existence
of
a
considerable
allied
force
at
abrantes
and
not
feeling
it
on
his
own
flank
formed
a
theory
that
it
must
have
been
sent
in
a
long
sweep
up
by
the
zezere
to
drop
into
the
upper
mondego
valley
and
cut
him
off
from
spain
nervousness
as
to
this
imaginary
movement
had
no
small
effect
on
his
main
operations

retreat
into
spain
by
sending
off
cole
and
de
grey
to
join
the
future
army
of
estremadura
on
the
march
wellington
reduced
the
force
about
him
by
men
and
had
no
more
than
left
on
the
ceira
the
newly
formed
division
which
was
marching
up
from
lisbon
and
would
ultimately
replace
cole
with
the
main
army
was
at
this
moment
only
reaching
santarem
it
did
not
come
up
to
the
front
till
march
was
at
its
end
for
the
rest
of
his
operations
against
masséna
therefore
wellington
was
more
than
ever
in
a
state
of
numerical
inferiority
and
forced
to
be
cautious
but
he
was
in
a
confident
mood
foreseeing
that
the
enemy
could
not
now
stop
in
portugal
and
must
be
starved
into
a
prompt
retreat
over
the
frontier
his
conviction
that
the
crisis
was
over
is
shown
by
another
dispatch
of
the
march
in
which
he
directs
that
the
whole
of
the
lisbon
militia
and
ordenança
be
dismissed
to
their
homes
the
former
on
furlough
the
latter
for
good
the
militia
of
the
lower
beira
the
castello
branco
country
and
of
northern
estremadura
were
also
to
return
to
their
native
districts
to
be
sent
on
leave
or
kept
under
arms
according
as
further
events
might
determine
thus
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
were
left
ungarrisoned
there
being
no
further
danger
to
be
feared
in
the
direction
of
lisbon
wellington
to
beresford
vii
there
was
still
much
work
however
for
the
militia
of
the
north
trant
s
and
wilson
s
brigades
who
were
brought
down
to
the
middle
mondego
and
sent
successively
to
peña
cova
mortagoa
and
fornos
to
guard
the
fords
and
restrain
the
french
from
endeavouring
to
raid
the
north
bank
of
the
river
it
was
unlikely
that
they
would
make
a
serious
attempt
to
cross
in
force
into
the
barren
country
under
the
serra
de
alcoba
when
they
were
in
such
a
desperate
plight
for
food
and
would
have
the
allied
army
close
behind
them
for
the
troops
were
to
march
again
on
the
the
middle
mondego
it
must
be
remembered
was
bridgeless
and
in
flood
from
the
spring
rains
even
if
masséna
had
driven
off
trant
and
wilson
it
would
have
taken
him
a
long
time
to
build
a
bridge
since
he
had
no
pontoons
and
wellington
would
have
been
pressing
him
in
the
rear
before
he
had
got
more
than
a
vanguard
over
the
water
the
marshal
seems
never
to
have
contemplated
at
this
date
a
movement
on
to
coimbra
or
oporto
by
the
north
bank
of
the
mondego
such
as
is
suggested
as
possible
by
some
of
the
commentators
on
the
campaign
after
the
day
of
condeixa
a
retreat
eastward
was
always
in
his
mind
his
army
was
too
dilapidated
to
make
the
least
offensive
stroke
i
think
it
necessary
for
the
interests
of
his
imperial
majesty
wrote
masséna
on
the
to
bring
the
troops
back
nearer
to
our
base
of
operations
by
our
fortresses
almeida
and
rodrigo
in
order
to
let
them
recover
a
little
from
their
fatigues
and
long
privations
and
to
allow
me
to
replace
so
much
equipment
which
is
now
entirely
lacking
rien
ne
nous

says
masséna
s
biographer

toute
la

entre

et

but
there
a
hindrance
or
rather
three
hindrances
the
mondego
was
not
fordable
at
the
moment
and
what
was
more
important
the
starving
army
could
not
have
lived
on
the
north
of
the
mondego
moreover
the
passage
of
the
mondego
with
a
lively
enemy
at
his
heels
would
have
been
too
dangerous
for
masséna
who
had
already
refused
to
accept
such
conditions
on
the
day
of
condeixa
from
masséna
s
dispatch
to
berthier
march
on
the
the
day
after
the
combat
of
foz
do
arouce
the
and
corps
marched
before
dawn
in
drenching
rain
and
retired
as
far
as
the
alva
river
where
the
bridge
of
ponte
de
murcella
repaired
for
a
moment
by
drouet
when
he
passed
it
a
few
days
before
had
again
been
broken
by
wilson
s
militia
it
took
all
the
day
to
repair
it
and
by
the
evening
only
the
artillery
had
been
sent
across
the
divisions
of
mermet
and
loison
followed
at
a
distance
leaving
behind
the
battalions
of
marchand
which
ney
had
once
more
chosen
to
form
his
rearguard
he
drew
them
up
across
the
road
a
few
miles
from
the
ceira
expecting
to
be
attacked
once
more
in
the
morning
but
to
his
surprise
wellington
did
not
cross
the
river
and
only
sent
a
few
scouts
to
discover
the
position
of
the
marshal
meanwhile
his
engineers
mended
the
bridge
at
foz
on
the
at
dawn
masséna
sent
the
corps
across
the
repaired
bridge
of
ponte
de
murcella
after
which
it
halted
at
cortiça
moita
and
other
villages
beyond
the
alva
river
whose
passage
it
was
prepared
to
defend
but
the
corps
was
marched
to
sarzedo
the
next
ford
and
placed
there
in
position
with
a
detachment
beyond
the
river
at
the
town
of
arganil
on
its
south
bank
the
corps
following
the
other
two
crossed
the
alva
at
ponte
de
murcella
later
in
the
day
and
joined
the
it
left
a
small
detachment
beyond
the
bridge
to
observe
the
expected
arrival
of
the
allies
of
the
horsemen
montbrun
s
heavy
dragoons
watched
the
lower
course
of
the
alva
from
ponte
de
murcella
to
its
junction
with
the
mondego
while
junot
s
was
sent
up
the
alva
eastward
to
hold
the
fords
beyond
arganil
these
dispositions
seemed
to
indicate
an
intention
to
make
a
serious
stand
behind
the
alva
where
the
positions
are
very
strong
the
river
is
a
fierce
mountain
torrent
in
a
deep
bed
with
precipitous
banks
and
very
few
fords
wellington
had
fixed
on
this
line
during
the
bussaco
campaign
in
the
preceding
autumn
as
the
position
where
he
should
await
the
french
if
they
advanced
by
the
south
bank
of
the
mondego
and
had
thrown
up
earthworks
on
each
side
of
the
ponte
de
murcella
these
were
of
course
useless
to
masséna
since
they
looked
the
wrong
way
but
the
river
line
was
almost
as
defensible
from
the
north
bank
as
from
the
south
and
presented
a
very
formidable
obstacle
to
the
pursuing
enemy
by
the
evening
of
the
wellington
was
once
more
in
touch
with
the
enemy
the
cavalry
brigades
of
slade
and
arentschildt
had
crossed
the
bridge
of
foz
do
arouce
and
followed
the
corps
to
the
alva
with
the
and
light
divisions
behind
them
the
infantry
however
did
not
show
themselves
but
encamped
in
the
hills
some
miles
from
the
ponte
de
murcella
they
found
the
road
strewn
with
dead
or
dying
mules
and
horses
and
took
a
certain
number
of
french
sick
and
stragglers
but
wellington
had
no
intention
of
forcing
the
ponte
de
murcella
position
while
two
divisions
took
this
road
the
rest
of
the
army
divisions
and
the
portuguese
independent
brigades
were
marched
eastward
by
the
steep
road
along
the
top
of
the
watershed
between
the
ceira
and
the
alva
the
route
towards
the
fords
of
the
upper
alva
they
drove
out
of
the
place
reynier
s
observing
detachment
which
reported
that
it
had
seen
the
allies
in
great
force
marching
this
news
convinced
masséna
that
his
adversary
was
intending
either
to
cross
the
ford
of
sarzedo
and
attack
reynier
or
to
move
still
further
up
the
valley
and
to
pass
the
alva
in
its
upper
course
so
throwing
himself
across
the
main
road
to
celorico
by
which
the
army
of
portugal
was
intending
to
retreat
nothing
but
cavalry
scouts
having
been
seen
opposite
the
ponte
de
murcella
it
was
supposed
that
wellington
s
whole
army
was
marching
on
arganil
accordingly
on
the
afternoon
of
the
masséna
ordered
the
corps
to
break
up
hastily
from
its
camps
and
to
march
all
night
to
galliges
on
the
high
road
beyond
reynier
s
left
this
was
done
and
junot
hurried
off
leaving
hundreds
of
foragers
scattered
on
the
slopes
towards
the
mondego
whither
they
had
been
sent
out
in
search
of
food
during
the
day
ney
remained
behind
at
the
ponte
de
murcella
to
keep
the
passage
as
long
as
possible
he
was
uncertain
as
was
masséna
whether
there
was
in
his
front
only
a
cavalry
screen
or
a
serious
force
of
all
arms
on
the
morning
of
the
this
problem
was
solved
for
the
light
division
came
down
to
the
river
drove
ney
s
rearguard
across
it
and
opened
a
cannonade
against
the
troops
of
the
corps
visible
on
the
opposite
bank
no
serious
attempt
was
made
to
pass
the
intention
being
only
to
hold
ney
to
his
ground
as
long
as
possible
by
demonstrations
while
the
real
crossing
was
made
far
this
plan
had
the
desired
result
in
the
afternoon
ney
received
the
news
that
the
allies
had
begun
to
cross
the
alva
at
the
ford
of
pombeiro
from
which
they
had
driven
off
one
of
reynier
s
battalions
if
any
considerable
force
got
over
the
river
at
this
point
the
corps
was
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
army
accordingly
the
marshal
ordered
his
three
divisions
to
march
off
without
a
moment
s
delay
i
never
saw
go
off
in
such
confusion
says
a
light
division
diarist
the
cavalry
brigade
of
arentschildt
sent
out
reconnoitring
parties
who
forded
the
river
while
the
engineers
rigged
up
a
temporary
wooden
bridge
close
to
the
ponte
de
murcella
by
which
the
and
light
divisions
were
able
to
cross

drew
up

order
on
the
serra
de

some
distance
above
the
river
there
was
no

here
and
after
dusk
the

decamped
taking
the
road

runs
parallel
to

protracted

from

but
his
dispatches
frequently
contained
what
he
knew
that

rather
than
the

of

he
might
have
been

with

and
need
not

padded
out
his

with
terminological
inexactitudes
it
must
be
confessed
that
his
fririon
played
a
good
second
to
him
when
he
wrote
in
his

that

up

was
the

without

and

without

for

and
we
had
marched
nearly
five
leagues
explains
a

diarist
the
pursuers
were
as
harassed
as
the
pursued
and
could
go
no
further
but
slade
was
thought
to
have
shown
weakness
he
picked
up
a
good
many
stragglers
and
sick
and
found
the
road
strewn
with
broken
vehicles
and
dying
mules
according
to

of

near

the

taking
on
the
right
hand
the
southern
and
more
hilly
route
reached
gouvea
the
corps
taking
the
northern
fork
got
to
villacortes
and
sent
its
cavalry
on
ahead
to
the
bridge
of
fornos
which
they
found
broken
and
guarded
by
trant

militia
the
corps
following
the
lay
at
pinhanços
since
leaving
the
ponte
de
murcella
the
french
were
a
little
less
pressed
for
food
the
district
through
which
they
were
now
passing
was
fertile
and
had
not
been
raided
before
most
of
the
peasantry
had
returned
to
it
during
the
winter
hasty
plundering
on
both
sides
of
the
road
brought
in
a
certain
amount
of
food
especially
in
the
way
of
cattle
which
had
been
sent
up
into
the
hills
but
were
often
discovered
by
skilled
marauders
there
was
continual
bickering
with
the

one
party
of
whom
only
strong
tried
with
more
courage
than
discretion
to
defend
the
village
of
penalva
against
the
advanced
guard
of
the
corps
all
along
the
road
the
pursuing
light
division
found
the
dead
bodies
of
peasantry
mixed
with
those
of
the
french
sick
who
had
fallen
by
the
way
on

reached

where
drouet
was
found
in

with

of

the

reached

and
cortiça
the
turning
off
at

on
the

a
most
distressing

reached

and

with
the

five
miles
in

at
the
convent
of
vinho
they
had
now
dropped
fifteen
miles
behind
the
french
rear
and
were
quite
out
of
touch
with
it
but
continued
to
pick
up
stragglers
men
are
said
to
have
been
taken
on
that
day
like
the
enemy
they
were
now
commencing
to
get
a
little
food
from
the
country
the
peasants
who
had
all
fled
to
the
mountains
on
the
enemy
s
retreat
on
seeing
us
come
down
baked
bread
for
the
troops
and
gave
us
whatever
they
had
left
they
had
suffered
a
good
deal
all
the
principal
houses
had
been
burnt
and
those
left
a
good
deal
destroyed
but
the
french
troops
had
not
been
able
to
discover
all
the
corn
concealed
simmons
of
the
diary
tomkinson
s
diary
on
the
the
french
army
had
reached
the
end
of
the
main
retreat
two
corps
were
concentrated
in
and
near
celorico
the
other
reynier
reached
guarda
where
it
found
claparéde
s
division
of
drouet
s
corps
which
had
been
there
for
some
weeks
they
were
now
only
three
marches
from
almeida
and
four
from
ciudad
rodrigo
communication
with
these
two
places
was
open
for
drouet
and
the
corps
had
now
come
into
touch
again
with
the
and
were
available
for
keeping
the
roads
safe
the
english
had
been
outmarched
and
masséna
might
have
retired
to
almeida
and
rodrigo
practically
unmolested
by
a
good
but
this
was
not
to
be
the
end
of
the
campaign
as
every
one
in
the
french
army
save
its
fervently
desired
for
generals
and
rank
and
file
alike
were
tired
out
and
yearned
for
a
cessation
of
mountain
marches
and
a
rest
in
cantonments
before
they
should
be
called
upon
for
another
effort
but
another
and
a
most
unexpected
episode
was
to
take
place
before
the
weary
columns
reached
rodrigo
masséna
made
one
more
attempt
to
save
his
face
and
to
avoid
being
thrust
over
the
spanish
frontier
along
the
road
on
to
which
his
adversary
had
forced
him
this
led
to
a
fortnight
more
of
manœuvres
in
the
mountains
and
to
the
combats
of
guarda
and
sabugal
after
which
the
french
marshal
had
to
pocket
his
pride
and
acquiesce
in
the
inevitable
these
operations
are
of
a
character
so
different
from
those
which
preceded
them
that
they
must
be
treated
as
a
separate
story
the
retreat
from
santarem
really
ended
at
celorico
the
events
between
march
and
april
must
be
dealt
with
apart
since
they
practically
amounted
to
a
belated
attempt
on
the
part
of
masséna
to
seize
the
offensive
once
more
and
to
shift
the
scene
of
war
without
his
adversary
s
consent
the
project
failed
and
as
we
shall
see
was
hopeless
from
the
first
ney
remained
quiet
at
cortiço
and
carapichina
this
day
but
was
only
ten
miles
from
celorico
and
so
may
be
considered
as
part
of
the
same
body
as
the
corps
before
dealing
with
it
a
few
remarks
on
the
general
character
of
the
operations
that
had
taken
place
between
march
and
march
must
be
made
when
reading
in
succession
two
narratives
of
masséna
s
retreat
from
santarem
to
celorico
one
by
an
english
and
one
by
a
french
it
is
often
difficult
to
realize
that
the
two
writers
are
describing
the
same
series
of
operations
most
of
the
french
conceive
the
retreat
to
have
been
a
series
of
triumphant
rearguard
actions
in
which
their
army
got
off
practically
unmolested
under
cover
of
the
skilful
operations
of
a
small
covering
force
on
the
other
hand
the
english
tell
the
tale
as
if
the
whole
french
army
was
easily
hunted
out
of
portugal
by
inferior
numbers
foiled
in
repeated
attempts
to
occupy
a
permanent
position
in
the
valley
of
the
mondego
and
finally
thrust
back
in
a
direction
which
it
did
not
intend
to
take
where
the
french
tell
of
nothing
but
an
orderly
retreat
and
small
losses
the
english
speak
of
the
capture
of
hundreds
of
prisoners
and
the
destruction
of
the
whole
of
the
retiring
army
to
a
certain
extent
the
mental
attitudes
of
both
sets
of
narrators
can
be
understood
and
justified
by
the
impartial
student
when
a
rearguard
action
takes
place
the
covering
force
left
behind
by
the
retiring
army
always
thinks
of
itself
as
being
opposed
to
the
whole
pursuing
host
it
considers
itself
to
be
braving
the
assault
of
immensely
superior
forces
and
if
it
holds
its
own
for
a
time
and
gets
off
without
crushing
losses
is
well
satisfied
with
its
own
conduct
this
is
both
justifiable
and
comprehensible
but
to
the
pursuer
the
same
rearguard
action
presents
an
entirely
different
moral
aspect
the
few
squadrons
and
battalions
forming
the
head
of
his
advance
find
themselves
suddenly
brought
to
a
check
by
a
considerable
hostile
force
arrayed
in
a
formidable
position
they
are
forced
to
halt
till
their
supports
begin
to
come
up
from
five
ten
or
fifteen
miles
in
the
rear
then
when
a
body
of
reserve
has
begun
to
accumulate
behind
them
they
launch
themselves
upon
the
enemy
who
gives
ground
after
more
or
less
fighting
and
retires
the
leading
brigade
or
division
of
the
pursuers
considers
that
it
has
victoriously
driven
the
whole
hostile
army
from
its
strong
position
and
is
no
less
satisfied
with
itself
than
is
the
force
to
which
it
has
been
opposed
in
short
all
rearguard
actions
begin
with
a
check
to
the
pursuers
they
all
end
with
the
retreat
of
the
defenders
this
is
their
necessary
course
both
parties
if
their
generals
play
the
game
properly
may
be
content
with
themselves
the
one
has
gained
time
for
the
escape
of
the
main
body
of
the
retreating
host
the
other
has
cleared
the
way
for
the
progress
of
the
pursuing
army
the
only
method
in
which
their
relative
merits
can
be
tested
is
by
asking
whether
the
rearguard
detained
the
advanced
guard
as
long
as
might
have
been
expected
inflicted
disproportionate
losses
upon
it
and
got
away
with
the
minimum
of
loss
to
itself
or
whether
on
the
other
hand
the
advanced
guard
evicted
its
opponents
from
their
position
at
a
rapid
rate
with
small
sacrifices
and
with
considerable
punishment
inflicted
on
the
enemy
the
mere
facts
that
the
rearguard
held
back
the
pursuers
for
some
hours
and
that
the
advanced
guard
ultimately
carried
the
enemy
s
position
are
obligatory
incidents
of
such
fights
when
we
come
to
examine
the
details
of
the
combats
which
took
place
between
the
and
of
march
we
shall
neither
hold
with
the
french
narrators
that
for
many
days
ney
and
two
divisions
of
the
corps
fought
and
held
back
wellington
s
whole
army
nor
with
the
english
narrators
that
the
light
and
divisions
unassisted
by
their
comrades
hunted
french
out
of
the
valley
of
the
lower
mondego
yet
it
is
true
that
of
french
infantry
officers
who
were
killed
or
wounded
in
portugal
between
these
dates
no
less
than
belonged
to
the
divisions
of
marchand
and
mermet
while
similarly
of
british
and
portuguese
officers
hit
in
the
same
period
no
less
than
nineteen
belonged
to
the
light
division
and
eight
more
to
the
clearly
therefore
ney
did
not
contend
with
the
whole
british
army
but
only
with
its
two
leading
divisions
and
those
two
divisions
did
not
contend
with
the
whole
french
army
but
only
with
the
two
units
which
formed
its
rearguard
fine
writing
on
both
sides
as
to
struggles
against
overwhelming
odds
must
be
disregarded
still
more
so
may
the
exaggerated
estimates
as
to
loss
inflicted
on
the
enemy
which
are
to
be
found
in
the
narratives
of
most
of
the
writers
what
they
are
worth
may
be
guessed
from
marbot
s
statement
that
the
british
lost
men
at
redinha
noël
raises
this
liberal
estimate
to
the
real
casualty
list
being
similarly
grattan
tells
us
that
the
french
had
men
de
at
foz
do
arouce
when
their
actual
loss
seems
to
have
been
about
noël
grattan
s
the
connaught
the
accusations
of
timidity
and
which
these
contemporary
chroniclers
lavish
upon
each
other
s
generals
are
equally
absurd
wellington
is
always
rallied
by
the
french
for
want
of
courage
and
enterprise
because
he
did
not
at
once
dash
the
first
two
or
three
battalions
that
came
up
against
a
division
in
position
but
waited
for
his
supports
and
ney
is
criticized
by
both
english
and
french
writers
for
having
sometimes
withdrawn
from
the
fight
over
early
because
at
condeixa
and
on
the
alva
he
hastened
to
get
out
of
a
dangerous
situation
both
generals
in
reality
acted
with
perfect
tactical
correctness
armies
do
not
meet
for
the
purpose
of
putting
in
the
maximum
of
fighting
without
regard
for
ends
or
consequences
and
the
commander
who
attacks
before
he
has
a
sufficient
force
collected
is
blameworthy
just
in
the
same
degree
as
the
commander
who
holds
out
too
long
in
a
hazardous
position
most
of
the
french
criticism
on
wellington
is
based
on
the
false
hypothesis
that
his
army
outnumbered
masséna
s
during
the
whole
retreat
and
that
he
therefore
should
have
achieved
greater
results
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
we
have
seen
he
was
never
stronger
than
the
enemy
because
he
had
been
forced
to
detach
beresford
s
two
divisions
against
soult
before
he
started
and
when
in
the
later
stages
of
the
retreat
the
french
were
short
of
conroux
s
division
of
the
corps
which
had
gone
on
to
celorico
ahead
of
the
main
army
it
must
be
remembered
that
wellington
from
march
onwards
was
deprived
of
cole
s
division
and
the
heavy
dragoons
who
had
been
sent
off
southward
to
join
beresford
a
pursuing
army
dealing
with
a
superior
retreating
army
must
act
with
the
greatest
caution
lest
it
should
suddenly
run
up
against
the
enemy
s
whole
force
and
find
itself
committed
to
an
offensive
action
against
greater
numbers
in
a
strong
position
wellington
never
fell
into
this
trap
he
manœuvred
the
french
out
of
every
line
which
they
took
up
without
incurring
any
danger
or
allowing
his
adversary
any
chance
of
harming
him
while
giving
all
credit
to
ney
for
the
brilliant
rearguard
tactics
by
which
he
often
held
back
the
pursuers
for
half
a
day
it
is
necessary
to
give
equal
credit
to
wellington
for
having
fought
his
way
through
half
a
dozen
formidable
lines
of
defence
with
a
minimum
of
loss
and
without
once
exposing
himself
to
the
chance
of
a
serious
check
after
all
his
object
was
to
drive
masséna
away
from
the
mondego
and
towards
spain
and
that
object
he
achieved
in
the
most
triumphant
fashion
the
student
must
he
specially
warned
against
fririon
s
figures
for
french
losses
though
he
was
masséna
s
and
wrote
a
account
of
the
whole
retreat
his
numbers
are
wholly
untrustworthy
he
states
that
the
corps
only
lost
killed
and
wounded
between
march
and
march
the
actual
losses
were

giving
the
army
a
rest
after
its
fatigues
and
privations
he
now
proposed
to
plunge
back
once
more
into
the
mountains
and
to
swerve
aside
from
his
places
of
strength
and
his
dépôts
the
commanders
of
the
corps
received
the
astounding
news
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
to
turn
towards
the
spanish
frontier
and
the
central
tagus
with
the
object
of
taking
up
a
position
in
the
country
from
which
he
would
threaten
central
portugal
on
a
new
front
this
necessitated
a
march
from
celorico
through
the
mountains
of
belmonte
and
penamacor
and
then
across
the
sierra
de
meras
into
the
plateau
of
northern
estremadura
dispatch
to
berthier
from
maceira
of
that
date
supposing
that
the
centre
of
the
iberian
peninsula
had
been
a
fertile
plain
resembling
lombardy
or
flanders
there
would
have
been
something
to
say
for
this
plan
still
more
might
it
have
been
advisable
if
the
french
army
had
been
a
fresh
and
intact
force
just
opening
a
campaign
pelet
masséna
s
chief
tries
to
justify
the
proposal
by
saying
that
it
was
more
conformable
to
the
general
rules
of
strategy
we
should
have
connected
ourselves
with
the
corps
in
estremadura
with
the
army
of
the
centre
and
the
general
pivot
of
operations
at
madrid
we
should
have
brought
lord
wellington
back
to
the
position
that
he
had
quitted
we
should
have
kept
the
results
of
the
advantages
recently
won
in
estremadura
which
were
so
soon
to
be
lost
we
should
also
have
had
the
means
to
menace
once
more
central
portugal
and
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
this
is
all
very
plausible
but
it
omits
the
crucial
facts
that
the
army
of
portugal
was
tired
out
destitute
of
munitions
and
almost
destitute
of
food
and
that
it
was
proposed
to
lead
it
across
two
difficult
ranges
of
mountains
full
of
gorges
and
defiles
into
a
region
which
was
one
of
the
most
thinly
peopled
and
desolate
in
all
spain
where
there
was
not
a
single
french
soldier
much
less
a
dépôt
of
any
sort
this
was
the
same
district
in
which
victor
had
starved
in
and
in
passing
through
which
wellington
had
suffered
so
many
privations
on
the
way
to
talavera
it
had
been
visited
in
february
by
a
flying
column
under
lahoussaye
sent
out
from
talavera
which
had
got
as
far
as
plasencia
and
alcantara
and
then
retired
because
it
was
absolutely
impossible
for
men
to
live
in
it
pelet
s
sur
la
guerre
d
in
et
masséna
s
maps
were
very
bad
the
actual
set
used
by
his
staff
is
in
existence
and
can
be
seen
at
belfast
but
his
intelligence
department
must
have
been
worse
than
his
maps
if
he
was
unaware
of
the
character
of
the
country
on
the
border
of
portugal
and
spain
and
of
that
lying
beyond
in
northern
estremadura
he
might
have
asked
information
about
it
from
reynier
and
ney
who
had
both
crossed
it
but
he
did
not
most
striking
of
all
however
is
the
ignorance
shown
in
these
orders
of
the
physical
and
moral
state
of
the
french
army
if
it
had
ever
reached
plasencia
it
would
have
got
there
without
a
gun
or
a
baggage
mule
the
caissons
and
carriages
were
almost
all
gone
already
a
single
set
of
figures
may
serve
to
show
the
situation
the
artillery
of
the
corps
started
from
almeida
in
september
with
wheeled
units
guns
caissons
waggons
and
horses
it
got
back
to
ciudad
rodrigo
on
april
with
guns
and
caissons
drawn
by
horses
having
lost
vehicles
and
horses
of
the
caissons
and
waggons
had
been
destroyed
before
the
commencement
of
the
retreat
the
rest
had
been
dropped
between
thomar
and
celorico
there
were
left
at
the
end
of
march
only
guns
with
caissons
of
ammunition
to
draw
which
required
all
the
horses
remaining
how
long
could
this
artillery
have
fought
with
only
one
caisson
of
ammunition
per
gun
left
how
many
horses
would
have
been
alive
after
another
hundred
miles
of
mountain
roads
even
if
some
guns
had
got
to
plasencia
how
long
would
it
have
taken
to
get
them
ammunition
from
salamanca
or
madrid
the
nearest
dépôts
the
same
question
would
be
no
less
forcible
with
regard
to
infantry
ammunition
which
was
depleted
to
an
equal
extent
with
that
of
the
artillery
captured
at
vittoria
they
were
long
after
given
to
belfast
university
all
these
interesting
figures
come
from
the
diary
of
colonel
noël
commanding
the
artillery
of
clausel
s
division
see
his
memoirs
pp
and
but
it
is
even
more
important
to
remember
that
the
army
of
portugal
was
also
in
desperate
straits
for
boots
and
clothing
in
many
regiments
a
third
or
a
quarter
of
the
men
had
no
footgear
but
rivlins
or
mocassins
made
every
few
days
from
the
hides
of
cattle
the
uniforms
were
in
rags
many
soldiers
had
nothing
that
recalled
the
regulation
attire
but
the
that
covered
everything
yet
the
main
thing
of
all
was
the
moral
aspect
of
affairs
the
army
would
fight
when
it
was
its
duty
as
french
armies
always
have
done
but
it
was
discontented
sulky
angry
with
the
marshal
to
whom
it
attributed
its
miseries
though
its
indignation
might
have
been
more
justly
reserved
for
the
emperor
who
had
set
his
lieutenant
an
impossible
task
the
rank
and
file
had
sunk
low
in
discipline
as
must
be
always
the
case
when
troops
have
been
living
by
daily
plunder
for
six
months
and
this
same
want
of
discipline
was
most
evident
among
the
generals
who
now
that
masséna
had
failed
openly
criticized
him
before
their
staffs
and
often
neglected
his
orders
masséna
suspected
ney
junot
and
reynier
alike
of
intending
to
denounce
him
to
the
emperor
as
a
blunderer
it
will
be
remembered
that
he
had
already
detected
reynier
in
a
trick
of
this
description
ney
had
been
girding
at
his
orders
with
fury
ever
since
the
retreat
began
and
was
telling
all
who
cared
to
listen
that
a
hasty
return
to
spain
was
the
only
possible
policy
and
that
the
dream
of
holding
out
on
the
mondego
or
the
alva
was
absurd
see
it
was
probably
not
on
mere
strategic
grounds
but
because
he
was
determined
to
assert
himself
to
prove
that
he
was
master
of
his
own
movements
and
that
he
was
not
yet
a
beaten
man
or
a
failure
that
masséna
issued
orders
on
the
for
the
corps
to
make
ready
to
move
southward
not
northward
from
guarda
and
for
the
and
to
prepare
to
follow
on
the
same
route
this
provoked
an
explosion
of
wrath
on
the
part
of
ney
who
in
the
course
of
four
hours
of
the
afternoon
wrote
three
successive
letters
to
his
commander
in
terms
of
growing
irritation
in
the
first
which
was
sent
off
before
receiving
the
detailed
orders
for
the
new
movement
he
merely
set
forth
all
the
objections
to
it
and
inquired
whether
masséna
had
the
emperor
s
leave
for
such
a
general
change
of
plans
in
the
second
after
he
had
received
and
read
the
orders
he
protested
formally
against
them
and
said
that
unless
positive
instructions
from
paris
authorizing
the
new
scheme
had
been
received
the
corps
should
not
march
he
gave
many
arguments
and
they
were
incontestably
true
the
army
has
need
to
rest
behind
the
shelter
of
almeida
and
ciudad
rodrigo
in
order
to
receive
the
clothing
and
shoes
which
are
absolutely
necessary
and
which
must
be
brought
up
from
the
magazines
your
excellency
is
mistaken
in
thinking
that
food
can
be
got
in
abundance
in
the
region
of
coria
and
plasencia
i
have
marched
through
that
country
during
the
attempt
to
cut
off
wellington
s
retreat
from
talavera
in
and
it
is
impossible
to
exaggerate
its
sterility
or
the
badness
of
its
roads
your
excellency
will
not
get
one
single
gun
so
far
with
the
teams
that
we
have
brought
out
of
portugal
moreover
this
manœuvre
so
singular
at
this
particular
moment
would
entirely
uncover
old
castile
and
compromise
all
our
operations
in
spain
i
am
fully
aware
of
the
responsibility
which
i
take
upon
myself
in
making
formal
opposition
to
your
intentions
but
even
if
i
were
destined
to
be
cashiered
or
condemned
to
death
i
could
not
execute
the
march
on
coria
and
plasencia
directed
by
your
highness
unless
of
course
it
has
been
ordered
by
the
emperor
the
three
letters
are
all
printed
in
full
in
fririon
s
and
the
second
of
them
in
s
pièces
within
two
hours
of
the
second
letter
ney
sent
in
the
third
which
was
no
mere
protest
nor
even
a
mere
refusal
to
move
but
an
open
declaration
of
his
intention
to
march
back
to
almeida
i
warn
your
excellency
that
i
shall
leave
my
positions
of
carapichina
and
cortiço
and
échelon
my
troops
from
celorico
to
freixadas
and
on
the
day
after
they
will
be
between
freixadas
and
almeida
this
disposition
is
forced
on
me
in
order
to
prevent
the
whole
force
from
disbanding
under
the
pretext
of
searching
for
the
food
necessary
for
its
subsistence
for
food
is
now
absolutely
unless
he
was
to
surrender
his
authority
altogether
and
obey
his
subordinate
masséna
had
now
to
strike
ney
had
put
himself
absolutely
in
the
wrong
in
the
way
of
military
subordination
though
he
was
as
absolutely
in
the
right
in
the
way
of
strategy
and
the
had
every
technical
justification
when
he
formally
deposed
him
from
the
command
of
the
corps
and
directed
him
to
leave
for
valladolid
without
delay
and
there
await
the
orders
of
the
emperor
loison
the
senior
of
the
three
divisional
generals
of
the
corps
was
ordered
to
take
over
its
command
next
morning
several
of
ney
s
partisans
urged
him
to
refuse
obedience
to
seize
the
person
of
masséna
and
to
declare
himself
of
the
army
of
portugal
we
are
assured
that
he
would
have
been
backed
in
the
step
by
the
whole
of
his
own
corps
and
would
have
met
no
resistance
from
the
others
for
masséna
was
universally
disliked
and
every
man
wished
to
continue
the
retreat
on
almeida
of
which
ney
was
the
advocate
but
he
shrank
from
levying
open
war
upon
his
chief
and
departed
among
the
tears
of
the
whole
corps
of
which
he
knew
every
officer
and
many
men
by
sight
it
had
been
under
him
without
a
break
since
he
first
formed
it
at
the
camp
of
montreuil
near
boulogne
in
ney
s
sprünglin
says
in
his
diary
that
ney
hesitated
for
some
time
before
rejecting
the
idea
of
a
de
against
masséna
which
was
hotly
urged
upon
him
and
opines
that
it
would
have
been
successful
and
most
popular
with
the
army
masséna
started
off
his
pelet
for
paris
next
day
with
orders
to
get
to
the
emperor
without
delay
and
explain
the
situation
before
ney
could
tell
his
tale
this
his
emissary
succeeded
in
doing
and
his
representations
to
napoleon
were
backed
by
those
of
foy
who
had
borne
masséna
s
earlier
message
of
march
and
was
still
in
paris
the
emperor
seems
to
have
approved
of
masséna
s
stringent
dealing
with
his
subordinate
and
even
to
have
expressed
his
satisfaction
with
the
new
plan
for
marching
the
army
of
portugal
to
the
middle
tagus
he
also
declared
that
of
the
type
of
ney
and
junot
were
a
mistake
and
that
to
avoid
further
friction
he
would
cut
up
the
whole
army
into
divisions
and
abolish
the
corps
altogether
but
at
the
same
time
he
allowed
ney
to
return
to
paris
gave
him
a
mere
formal
reproof
and
then
continued
to
employ
him
in
posts
of
the
highest
importance
next
year
the
marshal
was
to
win
his
last
title
of
prince
of
the
moscowa
under
his
master
s
eye
on
the
field
of
borodino

some
parts
of
this
interview
of
foy
with
napoleon
related
in
his
usual
vivid
style
are
too
good
to
omit
did
masséna
really
intend
to
force
the
passage
of
the
tagus
he
did
well
then
he
would
have
destroyed
his
army
if
he
had
tried
but
i
was
not
worried
about
it
i
knew
he
would
never
try
to
cross
would
masséna
pass
the
tagus
he
who
in
the
isle
of
lobau
wagram
campaign
of
would
not
try
to
pass
a
mere
brook
the
moment
you
told
me
that
he
had
returned
from
in
front
of
torres
vedras
i
knew
that
he
would
come
back
and
refuse
to
risk
a
general
engagement
wellington
is
a
cleverer
man
than
masséna
he
kept
his
eye
fixed
on
claparéde
s
division
if
claparéde
had
been
brought
forward
the
english
would
have
expected
to
be
attacked
would
have
gone
back
into
their
lines
portugal
is
too
far
off
i
can
t
go
there
myself
the
business
would
take
six
months
and
in
that
six
months
everything
would
be
hung
up
in
europe
see
foy
s
pp
ney
having
been
superseded
and
banished
masséna
could
carry
out
his
wild
plan
for
a
march
towards
northern
estremadura
through
the
midst
of
the
portuguese
mountains
on
the
the
corps
was
brought
into
celorico
and
its
artillery
moved
forward
as
far
as
ratoeiro
on
the
guarda
road
the
corps
left
celorico
and
moved
in
the
same
direction
with
its
cavalry
at
ponte
do
ladrão
in
advance
drouet
with
conroux
s
division
had
already
gone
back
towards
almeida
with
the
sick
and
wounded
of
the
whole
army
he
was
ordered
to
take
post
at
on
the
turon
between
almeida
and
ciudad
rodrigo
his
other
division
that
of
claparéde
was
sent
from

to
join
him
on
the
same
day
drouet
according
to
some
versions
of
the
events
of
this
critical
week
had
moved
back
of
his
own
accord
without
waiting
for
masséna
s
orders
but
it
is
clear
that
there
was
absolute
necessity
to
tell
off
some
covering
force
for
the
frontiers
of
leon
if
the
main
army
was
to
be
drawn
away
to
the
central
tagus
lest
wellington
should
send
off
a
detachment
to
attack
almeida
and
ciudad
rodrigo
and
find
nothing
to
hinder
him
for
the
next
five
days
the
march
southward
and
eastward
was
continued
after
a
rest
of
only
two
nights
at
guarda
the
corps
moved
on
the
of
march
by
two
bad
parallel
roads
through
the
hills
and
encamped
with
its
first
division
at
sortelha
and
its
second
at
aguas
bellas
a
flanking
detachment
of
cavalry
occupied
belmonte
further
to
the
west
in
order
to
keep
a
on
the
valley
of
the
zezere
the
corps
took
up
the
position
which
the
had
evacuated
at
guarda
it
is
recorded
to
have
lost
many
of
its
already
depleted
stock
of
horses
in
climbing
the
steep
ascent
into
that
town
which
stands
on
the
very
summit
of
the
serra
da
estrella
at
a
height
of
over
feet
above
no
other
town
in
portugal
lies
so
high
the
corps
followed
the
but
halted
short
of
guarda
to
cover
the
slow
progress
of
its
artillery
which
had
to
be
dragged
up
the
defile
with
doubled
teams
so
that
half
the
guns
and
vehicles
had
to
wait
at
the
bottom
while
their
beasts
were
assisting
to
draw
the
first
section
to
its
lofty
destination
the
saw
the
head
of
the
corps
at
val
de
lobos
on
the
road
to
penamacor
the
main
body
painfully
trailed
along
behind
junot
and
the
corps
left
guarda
but
took
not
the
path
that
reynier
had
followed
but
an
equally
difficult
one
leading
to
belmonte
but
the
guns
could
not
proceed
with
the
infantry
divisions
they
had
to
be
left
at
guarda
the
belmonte
road
being
pronounced
absolutely
impracticable
for
them
this
was
a
serious
check
to

had
scoured

far
as

with
the
sole
result
of
ruining
the
few
horses
that
were
still
in
passable
condition
in

the
game
was
up
it
ought
never
to
have
been
begun
and
ney
s
remonstrances
though
not
his
insubordination
were
completely
vindicated
on
march
masséna
reluctantly
conceded
that
a
prompt
retreat
into
spain
was
the
only
course
possible
but
he
chose
to
base
his
change
of
plans
not
on
the
true
ground
viz
that
he
had
ordered
the
army
to
perform
an
impossibility
but
on
two
other
facts
a
report
had
just
been
received
from
drouet
that
general
on
reaching
the
neighbourhood
of
almeida
had
sent
word
that
the
fortress
was
in
the
utmost
danger
for
it
had
only
fifteen
days
food
and
if
the
corps
had
to
retire
it
would
fall
from
starvation
in
a
fortnight
the
state
of
ciudad
rodrigo
was
little
better
he
therefore
besought
the
prince
of
essling
not
to
expose
these
two
places
by
carrying
the
army
of
portugal
off
to
the
valley
of
the
tagus
this
gave
a
strategical
reason
for
surrendering
the
new
scheme
of
campaign
but
there
was
also
a
moral
one
lassitude
reigns
in
the
army
of
portugal
many
of
its
regiments
were
in
the
expeditions
of
the
duke
of
dalmatia
soult
s
oporto
campaign
of
or
that
of
the
duke
of
abrantes
junot
s
vimeiro
campaign
of
the
officers
murmur
and
as
i
must
again
repeat
the
army
must
have
two
or
three
months
of
rest
to
recover
itself
i
was
the
only
soul
who
was
determined
to
hold
on
in
portugal
and
unless
i
had
set
my
will
to
it
in
the
strongest
fashion
we
should
not
have
stopped
fifteen
days
therein
the
troops
are
good
but
they
need
repose
living
by
marauding
even
though
it
was
organized
marauding
such
as
we
have
been
compelled
to
authorize
has
in
no
small
degree
weakened
discipline
which
is
in
the
greatest
need
of
restoration
all
this
was
very
true
but
it
had
been
equally
true
on
march
when
masséna
gave
his
orders
for
the
march
on
plasencia
the
root
of
his
failure
lay
neither
in
the
state
of
almeida
nor
in
the
demoralized
condition
of
the
army
but
in
the
fact
that
he
had
directed
his
troops
to
execute
a
movement
which
was
impossible
without
magazines
to
live
upon
or
roads
to
march
upon
this
was
a
gross
exaggeration
as
it
turned
out
that
there
was
forty
days
food
in
hand
masséna
accused
drouet
of
drawing
on
the
rations
for
his
own
corps
to
an
inexcusable
extent
masséna
to
berthier
march
from
alfayates
when
reynier
marched
from
coria
to
guarda
in
september
he
had
been
obliged
to
make
the
vast
circle
in
order
to
avoid
the
miserable
mountain
roads
on
march
masséna
gave
the
orders
which
marked
the
abandonment
of
his
great
plan
and
commenced
his
retrograde
movement
towards
ciudad
rodrigo
reynier
and
the
corps
abandoning
the
mountain
roads
came
down
by
a
lateral
march
to
sabugal
in

upper

of

were
to
stop
there
till
junot
and
the

coming
in
from
belmonte
should
have
reached
them
and
passed
behind
them
the

meanwhile
was
to
halt
at

till
the

had
extricated
itself
from
the
mountains

it
was
ordered

masséna
had
heard
practically
nothing
for
eight
days
put
in
its
appearance
in
the
most
forcible
fashion
falling
upon
the
enemy
just
as
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
complicated
movement
with
his
three
corps
separated
from
each
other
by
distances
of
some
twenty
miles
wellington
it
will
be
remembered
had
halted
about
half
of
his
army
on
the
alva
upon

for
sheer
want
of
provisions
sending
on
only
the
two
light
cavalry
brigades
and
the
and
light
divisions
to
pursue
masséna
on
the
celorico
road
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
enemy
was
about
to
retire
from
celorico
and
guarda
towards
the
spanish
frontier
with
the
smallest
delay

intention
of
proceeding
in

they
started
on
the

and
reached
galliges
that
night
no
news
had
yet
come
in
of
the
southward
movement
of
the
french
from
guarda
which
had
begun
on
the
preceding
day
the
vanguard
of
the
army
had
now
established
itself
in
celorico
which
was
reached
by
the
light
and
divisions
on
the
they
had
come
up
very
slowly
being
sadly
distressed
for
food
and
therefore
forced
to
make
very
short
stages
only

ration
of
bread
had
been
given
out
in
the
last
four
days
pack

portuguese
were
so
exhausted
and
sickly
that
they
were
left
behind
for
a
rest
and
to
wait
for
more
food

mangualde
on
the
upper
mondego

the

while
slade
managed
the
whole
vanguard
pushed
towards
guarda
each
swept
the
villages
on
the
flanks
of
its
route
the
result
of
the
exploration
was
to
show
that
a
very
large
body
of
the
enemy
had
retired
on
guarda
and
a
very
small
body
on
almeida
a
patrol
of
the
light
dragoons
hit
on
mermet

rearguard
and
took
an
officer
and
eighteen
men
from
it
the
reports
of
the
following
day
came
to
much
the
same
it
began
to
be
clear
that
almost
the
whole
french
army
must
have
gone
to
guarda
and
at
last
wellington
began
to
have
the
first
news
of
masséna
s
southward
movement
though
he
did
not
yet
grasp
its
meaning
the
french
appear
to
stick
about
guarda
he
wrote
to
beresford
and
yesterday
they
had
some
people
well
on
towards
manteigas
but
i
have
heard
nothing
of
them
from
grant
the
famous
scout
and
intelligence
officer
and
i
conclude
they
were
only
a
now
manteigas
is
at
the
source
of
the
zezere
near
covilhão
and
this
patrol
was
nothing
less
than
junot
s
flank
cavalry
exploring
out
from
belmonte
which
the
corps
had
reached
on
the
preceding
day
but
so
little
did
wellington
guess
what
was
running
in
masséna
s
mind
that
he
wrote
on
this
day
that
he
was
proposing
to
take
a
short
turn
to
the
alemtejo
to
supervise
beresford
s
operations
which
were
hanging
fire
in
the
most
discouraging
fashion

soon
as
the
french
were
over
the
frontier

been

whole
of

yet
had
not
the
least
idea
where
the
french
had
retired
diary
wellington
to
henry
wellesley
march
from
gouvea
meanwhile
wellington
made
up
his
mind
that
since
the
enemy
persisted
in
lingering
at
guarda
he
must
manœuvre
them
out
of
that
lofty
city
but
imagining
that
two
if
not
three
corps
were
concentrated
in
its
neighbourhood
he
would
not
attack
till
his
rear
had
come
up
from
the
alva
to
celorico
this
did
not
happen
till
the
when
the
division
reached
that
place
with
the
close
behind
but
on
the
previous
day
he
had
already
started
off
picton
to
cross
the
serra
da
estrella
by
the
mountain
road
by
prados
and
the
light
division
with
arentschildt

cavalry
to
take
the
longer
route
on
the
other
bank
of
the
mondego
which
goes
to
guarda
via
baracal
villa
franca
and
rapoulla
a
flanking
detachment
composed
of
a
wing
of
the
rifles
came
upon
a
small
rearguard
left
behind
by

at
freixadas

turned
them
out
of
the
village

a
few
prisoners

at

foot

march
for

which
was
to
be
the
commencement
of
the
general
retreat
that
masséna
contemplated
on
the
next
day
it
seems
clear
from
french
sources
that
loison
was
practically
taken
by
surprise
fririon
the
chief
of
the
staff
of
the
army
of
portugal
says
that
visiting
guarda
to
see
how
the
corps
was
arranged
he
found
maucune
s
brigade
encamped
in
a
ravine
dominated
on
all
sides
with
only
one
battalion
on
the
hill
on
which
picton
appeared
a
few
minutes
later
and
the
rest
in
a
position
where
they
were
perfectly
helpless
there
was
no
other
covering
force
at
all
out
in
front
of
the
town
hence
when
the
british
closed
in
loison
got
flurried
and
seeing
the
light
division
threatening
to
press
in
on
his
rear
absconded
at
once
without
fighting
as
his
force
was
still
nearly
strong
and
wellington
had
as
yet
only
three
divisions
of
no
greater
numbers
in
front
of
the
formidable
hill
of
guarda
it
seems
that
the
flight
of
the
corps
from
such
a
position
was
somewhat
ignominious
ney
would
undoubtedly
have
fought
a
brilliant
detaining
action

his
rearguard

were
alarming

have
cut
off
its
line
of
retreat
towards
the
coa
where
the
corps
was
awaiting
it
but
by
no
reports
came
to
hand
about
junot
and
wellington
was
under
the
impression
that
two
and
not
one
corps
had
been
holding
guarda
when
he
attacked
it
he
was
aware
that
reynier
was
at
sabugal
but
did
not
apparently
receive
any
information
which
demonstrated
that
there
was
another
heavy
column
in
this
direction
now
commencing
to
move
straight
across
the
front
of
his
own
advanced
guard
junot
was
able
to
extricate
himself
by
two
painful
marches
over
villainous
in
the
mountains
from
belmonte
to
urgueira
march
and
from
urgueira
to
sabugal
march
he
was
only
able
to
win
salvation
because
he
had
left
all
his
artillery
behind
him
at
guarda
and
was
therefore
able
to
go
wherever
infantry
could
climb
his
guns
had
been
given
in
charge
to
the
corps
and
formed
part
of
the
column
under
ferey
that
marched
by
pega
to
the
coa
wellington
to
beresford
from
celorico
march
yesterday
we
manœuvred
the
french
out
of
guarda
masséna
was
there
some
say
with
his
whole
army
i
think
certainly
with
two
corps
not
a
shot
was
vii
same
day
to
charles
stuart
they
were
much
stronger
than
we
i
had
only
three
divisions
on
the
vii
meanwhile
the
corps
had
to
complete
its
retreat
to
the
line
of
the
coa
and
reached
it
in
the
afternoon
harassed
but
not
seriously
damaged
by
the
two
british
cavalry
brigades
of
which
hawker
s
followed
the
column
on
the
northern
and
arentschildt
s
that
on
the
southern
of
the
two
parallel
roads
on
which
loison
was
moving
all
accounts
agree
that
general
slade
who
was
directing
both
brigades
showed
and
missed
several
fair
opportunities
of
attacking
the
enemy
s
rearguard
in
open
ground
very
favourable
to
cavalry
and
tactics
he
only
picked
up
a
few
stragglers
and
the
enemy
was
safely
across
the
coa
by
nightfall
marchand
s
division
at
ponte
sequeiro
ferey
s
and
mermet
s
at
bismula
seven
miles
further
to
the
south
where
they
were
now
only
eight
miles
from
reynier
s
right
wing
at
sabugal
the
british
had
not
yet
detected
junot
s
flank
march
which
was
hourly
bringing
him
nearer
to
safety
napier
s
statements
iii
are
quite
borne
out
by
tomkinson
s
diary
in
the
rear
of
pega
is
an
open
plain
of
two
miles
which
the
enemy
had
to
pass
as
usual
we
looked
at
them
for
half
an
hour
then
the
guns
were
ordered
up
and
in
place
of
firing
at
the
main
body
could
only
get
within
range
of
their
pickets
we
continued
to
follow
and
although
they
had
no
cavalry
our
general
was
afraid
to
go
into
the
plain
to
get
the
guns
in
range
of
the
infantry
they
of
course
got
clear
diary
p
on
the
the
corps
escaped
from
its
dangers
reached
sabugal
and
passing
behind
reynier
pushed
on
ten
miles
further
to
alfayates
where
it
halted
for
a
rest
the
troops
were
reduced
to
the
last
extreme
by
exhaustion
and
hunger
at
alfayates
within
three
miles
of
the
spanish
frontier
and
only
two
marches
from
ciudad
rodrigo
they
at
last
began
to
receive
regular
provisions
and
had
nearly
got
out
of
the
mountains
into
the
rolling
upland
of
southern
leon
why
masséna
the
moment
that
he
knew
that
junot
was
safe
did
not
continue
to
retreat
on
to
his
magazines
it
is
hard
to
say
but
he
remained
for
two
days
more
behind
the
upper
coa
and
thereby
exposed
himself
to
continued
danger
for
his
army
was
strung
out
on
too
thin
a
line
watching
twenty
miles
of
the
river
apparently
he
thought
from
seeing
no
british
infantry
on
the
and
that
wellington
had
halted
at
guarda
and
did
not
intend
to
continue
the
pursuit
on
sabugal
his
own
forces
continued
in
their
old
positions
throughout
the
and
of
april
save
that
all
montbrun
s
reserve
cavalry
was
sent
to
the
rear
to
the
valleys
of
the
agueda
and
the
azava
to
rest
and
recover
itself
the
larger
proportion
of
the
surviving
horses
being
quite
unserviceable
the
of
reynier
junot
and
loison
also
sent
back
many
dismounted
men
and
hundreds
more
whose
mounts
were
incapable
of
use
for
the
present
so
that
the
brigade
of
light
horse
attached
to
each
was
reduced
to
a
few
hundred
sabres
many
of
the
regiments
having
only
one
efficient
squadron
left
and
none
more
than
two
the
retreat
from
santarem
had
practically
disabled
the
french
cavalry
as
late
as
may
the
regimental
statistics
show
that
the
dragoons
had
only
available
horses
sick
or
sound
and
the
dragoons
only
they
had
started
the
campaign
with
and
respectively
wellington
meanwhile
having
discovered
by
the
explorations
of
his
horse
that
the
enemy
was
standing
firm
on
the
coa
resolved
to
dislodge
them
from
their
last
hold
on
portugal
to
do
this
he
required
his
whole
force
and
the
and
divisions
moved
onward
from
celorico
to
freixadas
on
the
to
come
up
into
line
with
the
and
light
divisions
with
them
there
was
now
present
the
division
which
reached
the
front
at
the
end
of
the
month
though
incomplete
for
the
light
brigade
of
the
german
legion
had
arrived
at
lisbon
more
than
a
fortnight
late
and
only
four
battalions
in
the
british
service
and
five
of
portuguese
were
at
present
allotted
to
the
newly
formed
unit
but
in
addition
several
newly
landed
battalions
came
up
and
joined
the
old
divisions
so
that
nearly
infantry
in
all
were
added
to
the
army
after
deducting
many
men
left
behind
from
sickness
or
exhaustion
during
his
advance
over
the
wasted
regions
of
beira
wellington
had
now
about
men
with
him
a
force
very
nearly
equal
to
that
of
the
enemy
which
on
the
of
april
had
sunk
to
including
officers
if
the
corps
now
in
the
vicinity
of
almeida
be
omitted
we
can
not
say
four
british
battalions
for
two
of
them
were
foreign
corps
the
and
the
brunswick
oels
light
infantry
the
two
line
regiments
were
the
and
and
line
and
caçadores
forming
collins
s
brigade
viz
for
division
for
light
division
for
the
division
including
pack
s
whole
brigade
the
plan
which
wellington
evolved
for
the
final
eviction
of
the
french
from
portugal
was
to
turn
their
left
wing
on
the
side
of
sabugal
while
containing
their
right
wing
the
corps
on
the
central
coa
occupation
was
at
the
same
time
found
for
the
corps
as
wilson
s
and
trant
s
militia
brigades
were
directed
to
cross
the
coa
near
its
confluence
with
the
douro
and
to
threaten
almeida
from
the
north
side
a
move
which
could
not
fail
to
have
the
effect
of
keeping
drouet
pinned
down
to
his
present
position
since
his
special
task
was
the
protection
of
that
place
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
make
out
why
wellington
chose
to
break
in
upon
the
french
left
rather
than
their
right
from
the
strategical
point
of
view
it
would
have
been
preferable
to
cross
the
coa
north
of
the
flank
of
the
corps
and
to
throw
the
whole
weight
of
the
british
army
so
as
to
drive
the
french
southward
towards
sabugal
and
alfayates
for
they
would
thus
be
separated
from
the
corps
thrust
into
the
barren
and
nearly
roadless
mountain
district
of
the
sierra
de
gata
and
the
sierra
de
meras
and
cut
off
from
almeida
and
even
from
ciudad
rodrigo
which
they
were
desirous
of
covering
whereas
to
turn
their
left
wing
would
only
have
the
effect
of
pushing
them
back
on
their
natural
line
of
retreat
towards
rodrigo
and
would
press
them
towards
rather
than
away
from
the
corps
the
british
general
s
course
seems
however
to
have
been
guided
by
tactical
rather
than
by
strategical
considerations
he
thought
that
he
had
a
good
opportunity
of
catching
the
corps
at
sabugal
in
an
isolated
position
and
crushing
it
before
the
or
the
could
come
up
to
its
help
and
but
for
a
chance
of
the
weather
it
seems
that
he
might
have
accomplished
this
design
with
complete
success
sabugal
a
little
walled
place
with
a
ruined
moorish
castle
lies
in
a
projecting
bend
or
hook
of
the
coa
which
turns
back
just
above
the
town
at
right
angles
to
its
original
course
which
is
directly
from
east
to
west
the
river
is
not
far
from
its
source
and
though
its
banks
are
steep
its
waters
are
narrow
and
there
are
many
fords
both
above
and
below
sabugal
if
a
strong
turning
column
concealing
itself
in
the
hills
passed
along
the
south
bank
of
the
coa
and
crossed
the
river
some
miles
above
the
town
it
could
throw
itself
upon
the
rear
of
the
corps
and
cut
it
off
from
its
retreat
on
alfayates
meanwhile
a
general
attack
by
wellington
s
main
body
would
drive
it
from
its
position
straight
into
the
arms
of
the
turning
column
and
there
would
be
a
good
chance
of
inflicting
a
crushing
defeat
upon
the
corps
perhaps
of
capturing
it
wholesale
if
the
attack
were
delivered
by
surprise
at
dawn
the
whole
matter
ought
to
be
completed
before
either
the
or
the
corps
could
get
up
to
the
support
of
reynier
when
at
last
they
could
appear
on
the
field
the
corps
would
be
already
demolished
and
wellington
was
prepared
to
risk
a
general
action
it
was
with
this
design
that
his
movements
of
the
and
of
april
were
planned
the
and
divisions
were
brought
up
from
celorico
to
guarda
and
from
thence
to
join
the
light
and
divisions
which
were
already
lying
along
the
coa
over
against
the
french
lines
the
division
was
left
at
rapoulla
de
coa
facing
loison
s
centre
and
a
single
battalion
of
the
division
observed
the
bridge
of
sequeiro
opposite
his
northern
flank
these
troops
showed
themselves
freely
and
kept
loison
anxious
for
nothing
seemed
more
likely
than
that
the
general
attack
would
be
directed
against
him
meanwhile
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
the
army
five
divisions
and
two
cavalry
brigades
over
men
was
launched
against
reynier
the
turning
column
was
to
be
formed
by
the
light
division
and
the
two
cavalry
brigades
who
were
to
ford
the
coa
at
two
separate
points
two
and
three
miles
respectively
above
sabugal
if
erskine
who
was
to
command
it
so
decided
the
column
might
cross
even
higher
up
it
was
intended
that
it
should
appear
far
beyond
reynier
s
left
wing
and
should
strike
over
the
hills
of
quadraseis
to
the
village
of
torre
on
the
alfayates
road
where
it
would
be
placed
across
his
line
of
retreat
the
ground
in
that
direction
was
open
and
favourable
for
cavalry
meanwhile
the
enemy
was
to
be
given
no
chance
of
falling
upon
this
detachment
since
he
was
to
be
attacked
in
front
with
very
superior
forces
picton
and
his
division
were
to
cross
an
easy
ford
a
mile
south
of
sabugal
the
division
was
to
assail
the
at
the
same
moment
the
and
divisions
were
a
few
miles
behind
ready
to
support
the
two
leading
columns
in
the
front
attack
it
was
intended
that
the
turning
force
should
cross
the
coa
first
but
only
so
far
ahead
of
the
frontal
attacking
force
as
to
make
it
certain
that
it
should
not
get
engaged
with
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
before
the
and
divisions
were
coming
into
action
the
french
pickets
having
been
pushed
close
back
to
the
river
on
the
preceding
day
by
the
cavalry
it
was
certain
that
they
would
see
nothing
of
the
movements
till
they
were
well
developed
unfortunately
the
morning
of
the
of
april
was
one
of
dense
fog
good
for
concealing
the
march
of
the
troops
but
bad
in
that
it
prevented
the
troops
from
discovering
their
objective
both
picton
and
dunlop
who
was
commanding
the
division
in
leith
s
absence
on
leave
resolved
not
to
move
and
sent
to
wellington
who
was
hard
by
for
orders
not
so
the
rash
and
presumptuous
erskine
who
repeated
this
day
the
precise
mistake
that
he
had
made
at
casal
novo
three
weeks
back
without
coming
himself
to
the
front
he
sent
an
to
the
light
division
to
bid
it
descend
to
the
river
and
cross
at
the
ford
which
had
been
assigned
to
it
in
the
general
scheme
the
cavalry
were
also
ordered
to
move
forward
and
take
the
other
ford
more
to
the
right
by
which
they
were
to
get
into
the
enemy
s
rear
details
may
be
verified
in
wellington
xiii
beckwith
s
brigade
the
leading
one
of
the
light
division
consisted
of
the
elder
s
caçadores
the
of
that
arm
and
four
companies
of
the
rifles
it
was
waiting
in
column
on
the
road
above
the
river
when
erskine
s
rode
up
and
asked
the
brigadier
in
a
peremptory
tone
why
he
did
not
beckwith
at
once
struck
off
in
the
direction
where
he
supposed
the
ford
to
be
but
missing
his
line
in
the
fog
did
not
march
sufficiently
far
to
the
right
and
reached
the
coa
not
at
the
true
ford
but
at
a
hazardous
passage
nearly
a
mile
nearer
to
sabugal
where
the
water
came
up
to
the
men
s
drummond
s
brigade
followed
at
a
distance
and
used
the
same
wrong
path
the
cavalry
to
whom
sir
william
erskine
had
joined
himself
taking
their
bearings
from
the
light
division
came
down
to
the
river
not
very
far
to
its
right
at
a
point
some
two
miles
more
to
the
west
than
was
intended
they
lost
much
time
in
searching
for
a
ford
by
the
time
that
they
found
one
the
light
division
was
already
heavily
engaged
and
the
passage
ultimately
discovered
was
so
close
to
that
force
that
the
dragoons
came
up
almost
in
drummond
s
rear
instead
of
far
out
on
his
flank
wellington
s
orders
were
to
cross
miles
at
least
above
sabugal
the
actual
crossing
was
only
miles
above
reynier
s
pickets
were
close
to
the
water
s
edge
and
opened
a
scattering
fire
on
the
head
of
beckwith
s
column
while
it
was
still
struggling
across
the
river
but
they
were
easily
driven
off
and
the
brigade
formed
up
on
the
further
side
in
the
usual
order
of
the
light
division
with
a
very
strong
skirmishing
screen
composed
of
four
companies
of
the
and
three
of
elder
s
caçadores
the
and
the
other
of
the
portuguese
came
on
in
line
a
few
hundred
yards
behind
the
riflemen
they
were
still
smothered
in
the
fog
and
could
discover
nothing
more
than
that
they
were
pursuing
the
french
pickets
up
a
gentle
slope
mostly
unenclosed
waste
ground
but
cut
up
by
a
few
fields
with
low
stone
walls
pushing
forward
briskly
they
presently
came
upon
a
french
regiment
which
was
already
under
arms
and
preparing
to
show
a
front
against
them
what
had
happened
in
the
mist
was
that
the
light
division
instead
of
getting
round
the
flank
of
reynier
s
position
had
struck
directly
against
it
the
corps
had
been
established
on
the
long
hill
behind
sabugal
and
above
the
coa
ready
to
resist
a
frontal
attack
with
merle
s
division
on
the
left
and
heudelet
s
on
the
right
above
the
town
beckwith
had
struck
upon
the
léger
the
left
regiment
of
the
division
of
the
corps
merle
warned
by
the
fire
of
the
pickets
was
making
a
new
front
to
the
general
line
of
the
french
army
and
had
just
got
the
four
battalions
of
the
extreme
flank
regiment
drawn
out
they
were
as
usual
in
column
of
divisions
double
companies
with
a
weak
skirmishing
line
in
front
which
was
at
once
driven
in
by
the
rifles
and
caçadores
merle
then
led
down
his
four
columns
against
the
screen
of
light
troops
which
covered
beckwith
s
line
and
drove
them
back
with
considerable
loss
to
himself
and
little
to
his
opponents
since
he
had
only
skirmishers
to
shoot
at
while
his
own
compact
battalion
columns
were
very
vulnerable
the
light
troops
fell
back
to
each
flank
of
the
line
presented
by
the
and
the
formed
companies
of
the
caçadores
and
then
halted
and
turned
upon
the
enemy
the
balance
of
numbers
was
now
in
favour
of
beckwith
s
brigade
for
though
he
had
only
two
and
a
half
battalions
and
the
enemy
four
the
french
units
were
very
weak
the
léger
having
only
men
while
the
alone
was
a
strong
battalion
of
bayonets
and
its
auxiliary
light
troops
were
at
least
more
it
was
not
surprising
therefore
that
the
french
regiment
soon
went
to
the
rear
badly
hit
after
a
short
sharp
exchange
of
volleys
beckwith
followed
pushing
the
enemy
through
a
small
chestnut
wood
till
he
arrived
at
the
southern
summit
of
the
ridge
on
which
the
french
line
had
been
drawn
out
here
he
found
himself
confronted
by
the
seven
battalions
of
the
of
the
line
and
the
léger
the
remaining
regiments
of
merle
s
division
which
were
hurrying
along
the
crest
to
the
assistance
of
their
comrades
of
the
léger
blinding
rain
came
on
at
this
moment
and
much
diminished
the
efficacy
of
the
british
fire
attacked
by
double
numbers
of
fresh
troops
beckwith
s
brigade
was
thrust
back
for
some
distance
but
they
rallied
behind
some
stone
walls
of
enclosures
just
as
the
shower
ceased
and
after
an
obstinate
contest
of
musketry
stopped
the
french
regiments
who
falling
into
disorder
retired
up
the
slope
to
though
conscious
that
he
was
now
engaged
against
hopeless
odds
and
though
he
could
see
nothing
of
drummond
s
brigade
or
the
british
cavalry
which
ought
by
this
time
to
have
come
up
to
his
support
beckwith
went
up
the
hill
a
second
time
in
pursuit
when
he
reached
the
crest
he
came
upon
the
divisional
battery
of
merle
drove
it
off
and
captured
one
howitzer
immediately
after
he
was
outflanked
on
his
left
by
infantry
apparently
the
rallied
léger
while
on
the
right
he
was
charged
by
two
squadrons
of
chasseurs
and
hussars
all
that
the
depleted
cavalry
brigade
of
pierre
soult
could
put
in
line
that
day
the
and
their
comrades
were
hardly
pressed
and
had
to
give
ground
but
sheltering
once
more
among
the
enclosures
refused
to
relinquish
their
position
on
the
slope
the
captured
howitzer
lay
out
in
their
front
in
an
open
space
swept
by
the
musketry
of
both
parties
desperate
attempts
were
made
by
groups
on
each
side
to
rush
out
and
bring
it
in
but
to
no
effect
as
the
was
too
heavy
beckwith
s
brigade
was
in
a
most
dangerous
position
only
preserved
from
annihilation
by
the
fact
that
the
mist
and
rain
prevented
the
enemy
from
recognizing
the
smallness
of
the
force
opposed
to
him
two
and
a
half
battalions
against
eleven
or
men
against
at
this
moment
assistance
at
last
arrived
the
brigade
of
the
light
division
under
drummond
appeared
on
the
scene
it
consisted
of
the
two
battalions
of
the
the
caçadores
and
four
companies
of
the
about
bayonets
having
lost
touch
of
the
brigade
at
the
ford
it
had
taken
a
route
much
more
like
that
originally
intended
by
wellington
to
be
employed
and
had
come
up
the
back
slope
of
the
heights
far
to
the
right
of
beckwith
without
meeting
any
enemy
the
noise
of
the
combat
attracted
drummond
to
his
left
he
changed
his
direction
and
was
coming
over
the
hillside
and
approaching
beckwith
when
he
received
a
most
order
from
erskine
who
was
with
the
cavalry
some
way
to
his
right
rear
directing
him
not
to
advance
or
engage
but
to
have
held
back
would
have
meant
to
allow
the
brigade
to
be
destroyed
disregarding
the
order
drummond
deployed
the
the
caçadores
and
the
on
the
right
of
the
enclosures
where
beckwith
was
fighting
with
the
in
reserve
and
advanced
firing
this
attack
by
a
fresh
force
was
too
much
for
the
french
and
who
had
suffered
severely
in
the
earlier
fighting
they
gave
way
and
drummond
with
beckwith
following
in
échelon
on
his
left
regained
the
crest
of
the
heights
and
recaptured
the
french
howitzer
the
two
brigades
were
still
engaged
in
a
fierce
struggle
with
merle
s
division
when
reynier
brought
up
the
brigade
of
heudelet
s
division
the
seven
battalions
of
the
léger
and
ligne
which
had
formed
the
centre
of
his
original
line
of
battle
these
troops
attacked
the
left
flank
of
the
light
division
beckwith
s
men
and
put
them
in
grave
danger
for
the
and
caçadores
were
in
great
disorder
at
the
same
time
the
two
french
squadrons
charged
again
upon
the
flank
of
the
fortunately
a
stray
squadron
of
the
light
dragoons
came
up
and
assisted
in
repulsing
them
this
was
the
only
aid
given
by
the
cavalry
this
day
erskine
contrived
to
keep
them
useless
countermarching
in
the
mist
some
way
from
the
fighting
front
this
fact
comes
from
a
note
by
sir
john
bell
of
the
in
my
possession
he
writes
just
as
the
brigade
changed
its
direction
the
general
being
at
some
distance
sent
an
order
for
it
not
to
engage
but
the
staff
officer
who
carried
it
and
drummond
seeing
how
matters
stood
took
the
liberty
of
forgetting
the
message
so
that
beckwith
should
have
the
full
benefit
of
the
support
at
hand
no
question
was
ever
asked
as
to
the
of
the
at
this
moment
the
fog
suddenly
lifted
and
both
wellington
and
reynier
were
able
to
make
out
the
face
of
the
battle
the
sight
was
not
altogether
comforting
to
either
of
them
wellington
could
see
the
light
division
on
the
crest
opposed
by
a
very
superior
enemy
the
proportion
was
about
five
to
three
at
this
moment
and
with
their
left
flank
turned
by
the
column
which
had
just
come
up
reynier
on
the
other
hand
saw
the
masses
of
picton
s
and
dunlop
s
divisions
halted
close
above
the
fords
at
and
below
sabugal
and
just
preparing
to
cross
he
had
so
stripped
his
centre
and
right
while
bringing
up
troops
to
crush
the
light
division
that
only
the
two
regiments
forming
heudelet
s
brigade
the
eight
weak
battalions
of
the
léger
and
ligne
about
bayonets
were
left
to
occupy
two
miles
of
slope
on
each
side
of
the
town
of
sabugal
reynier
saw
that
they
must
be
scattered
by
the
approaching
onset
for
men
were
hurrying
down
towards
the
fords
and
gave
instant
orders
for
a
general
retreat
the
intact
brigade
was
to
abandon
sabugal
and
the
heights
concentrate
and
go
off
at
the
double
to
take
up
a
position
a
mile
to
the
rear
on
the
road
to
alfayates
merle
s
shattered
troops
on
the
crest
facing
the
light
division
were
directed
to
make
off
in
such
order
as
they
might
taking
the
artillery
with
them
and
to
seek
refuge
behind
this
reserve
to
prevent
beckwith
and
drummond
from
pursuing
them
the
brigade
of
heudelet
the
léger
and
were
ordered
to
keep
up
a
defensive
fight
upon
the
heights
where
they
had
just
come
into
action
this
brigade
was
thereby
exposed
to
grave
danger
for
while
it
was
doing
its
best
to
contain
the
light
division
picton
coming
up
from
the
river
at
a
furious
pace
with
the
fusiliers
deployed
in
his
front
rushed
in
upon
its
flank
and
drove
its
battalions
one
upon
another
the
and
were
overwhelmed
and
thrust
down
the
back
of
the
hill
with
a
loss
of
men
of
whom
were
unwounded
prisoners
their
wrecks
took
refuge
with
the
other
brigades
which
retired
as
rapidly
as
they
could
along
the
alfayates
road
with
the
léger
and
ligne
the
only
intact
body
covering
the
flight
of
the
rest
the
british
division
had
crossed
at
sabugal
without
meeting
opposition
or
losing
a
man
but
was
too
far
to
the
left
to
be
of
any
use
in
urging
the
pursuit
that
duty
fell
to
picton
who
was
pressing
the
french
rearguard
when
the
rain
which
had
been
falling
for
almost
the
whole
morning
became
absolutely
torrential
and
hid
the
face
of
the
so
thoroughly
that
wellington
commanded
the
whole
army
to
halt
it
is
said
that
this
order
was
given
on
the
false
intelligence
that
the
corps
was
visible
coming
up
from
alfayates
to
join
reynier
a
report
for
which
there
was
no
foundation
whatever
erskine
and
the
cavalry
never
touched
the
retreating
force
save
one
squadron
of
the
german
hussars
who
happed
upon
the
french
transport
column
and
captured
the
private
baggage
of
reynier
himself
and
general
pierre
soult
this
statement
is
made
by
tomkinson
in
his
diary
on
april
many
details
in
this
narrative
of
the
combat
of
sabugal
will
be
found
to
differ
from
those
given
in
earlier
histories
i
have
been
relying
for
the
french
movements
largely
on
the
life
of
general
merle
the
officer
who
was
in
charge
of
most
of
the
fighting
and
had
the
best
chance
of
giving
a
correct
story
braquehay
s
général
pp
so
ended
in
comparative
disappointment
an
operation
which
would
have
had
glorious
results
if
the
fog
had
not
intervened
and
which
might
even
with
that
drawback
have
been
much
more
decisive
if
sir
william
erskine
had
shown
ordinary
prudence
and
ability
the
actual
combat
as
wellington
truly
observed
was
one
of
the
most
glorious
that
british
troops
were
ever
engaged
in
for
the
light
division
with
its
bayonets
had
fought
the
whole
of
the
corps
save
one
brigade
and
had
punished
its
adversaries
in
the
most
exemplary
style
without
suffering
any
corresponding
loss
really
these
attacks
in
column
against
our
line
are
very
contemptible
wrote
wellington
to
beresford
next
morning
the
chief
glory
lay
with
the
who
fought
three
separate
contests
with
three
successive
bodies
of
opponents
and
counted
very
nearly
half
of
the
total
british
loss
in
their
ranks
beckwith
their
brigadier
was
the
admired
of
all
beholders
relate
with
pride
how
he
rode
first
in
the
advance
and
last
in
the
retreat
with
blood
streaming
from
a
wound
on
his
temple
keeping
the
men
in
rank
checking
those
who
showed
a
tendency
to
quicken
the
pace
and
directing
the
fire
with
perfect
coolness
it
was
in
a
great
degree
the
confidence
inspired
by
his
cheerful
and
resourceful
leading
which
enabled
the
brigade
to
keep
up
the
fight
against
impossible
odds
down
to
the
moment
of
the
arrival
of
drummond
and
the
supports
upon
the
scene
illustration
sabugal
the
total
loss
of
the
french
was
officers
and
men
this
fearful
proportion
of
losses
in
the
commissioned
ranks
was
due
to
the
gallantry
with
which
they
threw
away
their
lives
in
bringing
up
to
the
front
the
shaken
and
demoralized
soldiers
who
could
not
face
the
english
musketry
one
gun
and
unwounded
prisoners
were
taken
the
british
loss
was
only
that
of
their
portuguese
companions
no
more
than
of
the
total
of
no
less
than
were
men
of
the
light
division
of
whom
belonged
to
the
picton
s
troops
only
engaged
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
end
of
the
combat
had
casualties
the
horse
artillery
lost
one
the
german
hussars
two
men
wounded
it
is
sufficiently
clear
from
these
figures
who
had
done
the
fighting
that
day
see
the
tables
of
the
french
and
british
losses
in
appendix
no
vi
fririon
as
chief
of
the
staff
must
have
seen
and
passed
the
french
return
giving
casualties
yet
in
his
narrative
allows
for
only
saying
on
a
beaucoup
exagéré
les
pertes
les
chiffres
que
nous
donnons
sont
très
this
is
only
one
example
of
his
habit
of
falsifying
figures
in
which
he
rivalled
masséna
and
soult
on
the
afternoon
following
the
combat
of
sabugal
masséna
abandoned
the
line
of
the
coa
drawing
back
the
corps
to
join
the
other
two
at
alfayates
next
morning
april
at
early
dawn
the
whole
army
made
a
forced
march
to
the
rear
for
there
seemed
every
probability
that
wellington
would
appear
to
force
on
a
general
action
during
the
course
of
the
day
and
it
was
necessary
to
avoid
the
chance
of
being
thrust
against
the
sierra
de
gata
and
cut
off
from
ciudad
rodrigo
accordingly
the
corps
covered
more
than
twenty
miles
and
did
not
halt
till
it
had
reached
fuentes
de
oñoro
the
corps
marching
a
less
distance
halted
at
fuente
guinaldo
on
the
direct
road
to
ciudad
rodrigo
the
corps
on
a
road
between
the
other
two
stopped
at
campillo
the
reserve
cavalry
of
montbrun
which
was
in
such
bad
condition
that
it
had
to
be
covered
by
the
infantry
instead
of
acting
as
their
screen
drew
back
to
el
bodon
and
other
villages
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
rodrigo
by
this
movement
masséna
recovered
his
communication
with
the
corps
which
still
lay
on
the
turon
near
almeida
for
the
corps
was
now
within
fifteen
miles
of
drouet
s
head
quarters
at
val
de
mula
while
the
and
corps
covered
the
roads
to
ciudad
rodrigo
on
the
following
day
april
the
two
corps
drew
back
to
carpio
marialva
and
other
places
within
a
few
miles
of
that
fortress
but
the
corps
remained
at
fuentes
de
oñoro
in
order
to
keep
touch
with
the
till
the
latter
should
have
evacuated
a
position
which
had
now
become
dangerous
and
for
if
masséna
went
back
to
the
agueda
drouet
could
not
linger
near
almeida
lest
he
should
be
cut
off
from
the
main
army
meanwhile
wellington
had
occupied
on
the
masséna
s
old
head
quarters
at
alfayates
and
sent
forward
his
cavalry
to
albergaria
alamedilla
and
other
villages
where
they
came
in
touch
with
the
outposts
of
the
and
corps
the
light
division
felt
for
any
traces
of
the
french
at
val
de
espinha
and
quadraseis
and
finding
none
pushed
on
to
alfayates
the
and
divisions
came
to
that
place
also
on
the
next
day
by
that
evening
april
it
was
certain
that
masséna
was
falling
back
to
ciudad
rodrigo
perhaps
even
further
to
the
rear
the
state
of
his
army
of
which
wellington
had
ample
evidence
from
the
capture
of
more
sick
stragglers
and
baggage
during
this
and
the
two
next
days
rendered
it
extremely
likely
that
the
french
would
not
be
able
to
halt
till
they
reached
their
magazines
at
salamanca
the
british
general
had
no
intention
of
following
the
enemy
far
into
spain
he
had
again
outmarched
his
supplies
for
the
new
base
at
coimbra
had
only
just
been
established
and
convoys
from
it
were
coming
in
slowly
and
with
great
delays
since
they
had
to
be
brought
up
over
the
wasted
and
depopulated
region
which
the
french
had
just
evacuated
till
he
had
some
magazines
accumulated
nearer
the
frontier
he
could
not
dream
of
a
serious
offensive
movement
into
leon
his
letters
at
this
time
are
full
of
laments
as
to
the
state
of
the
portuguese
troops
especially
of
the
brigades
which
were
fed
by
their
own
commissariat
they
had
dropped
so
many
sick
and
stragglers
in
the
advance
that
on
april
they
were
short
of
the
number
with
which
they
had
started
from
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
the
brigade
in
the
division
had
fallen
to
rank
and
file
from
with
which
it
had
set
out
that
in
the
division
to
from
pack
s
brigade
had
been
left
behind
on
the
mondego
from
sheer
inability
to
march
and
had
not
been
able
to
join
in
the
guarda
and
sabugal
operations
it
was
necessary
to
wait
till
the
ranks
were
fuller
the
men
were
not
lost
but
left
behind
exhausted
and
could
be
collected
when
a
systematic
supply
of
food
was
procurable
the
allied
army
could
not
dream
of
entering
spain
with
the
intention
of
living
by
plunder
and
requisitions
as
the
french
habitually
did
in
the
diary
of
tomkinson
of
the
light
dragoons
there
is
a
curious
note
as
to
the
capture
of
a
caravan
or
large
coach
belonging
to
the
staff
and
more
especially
to
masséna
s
portuguese
adviser
the
marquis

ambition
at
the
moment
did
not
go
beyond
the
hope
of
recovering
almeida
which
he
conceived
to
be
doomed
to
fall
and
possibly
ciudad
rodrigo
also
if
the
enemy
should
be
forced
to
fall
back
towards
salamanca
but
almeida
at
least
he
was
determined
to
make
his
own
and
the
first
necessity
was
to
clear
away
the
corps
from
its
neighbourhood
he
was
convinced
that
drouet
would
retreat
when
he
heard
that
masséna
had
retired
to
the
agueda
and
thought
that
his
motions
might
be
quickened
by
a
demonstration
the
division
and
pack
s
portuguese
were
destined
for
the
blockade
of
almeida
but
they
would
not
be
up
for
some
days
and
meanwhile
trant
s
militia
which
was
already
on
the
lower
coa
was
directed
to
push
in
boldly
upon
the
place
and
promised
the
support
of
slade
s
cavalry
brigade
on
the
trant
always
daring
and
full
of
enterprise
pressed
forward
to
val
de
mula
on
the
further
side
of
almeida
and
met
there
claparéde
s
division
on
its
way
towards
the
agueda
conroux
had
already
departed
the
militia
engaged
in
an
irregular
fight
with
the
french
who
turned
promptly
round
upon
them
and
seemed
likely
to
make
havoc
of
them
near
the
village
of
aldea
do
obispo
but
just
as
the
attack
grew
threatening
slade
s
dragoons
appeared
from
the
south
with
bull
s
horse
artillery
battery
and
drew
up
on
the
flank
of
the
enemy
s
troops
the
artillery
were
already
beginning
to
enfilade
them
when
claparéde
forming
his
division
into
battalion
squares
made
a
hasty
retreat
towards
the
agueda
and
passed
it
at
the
bridge
of
barba
del
puerco
erskine
who
was
in
command
of
the
expedition
did
not
press
him
hard
and
the
french
according
to
their
own
account
only
lost
killed
and
officers
and
men
wounded
all
by
cannon
shot
for
the
dragoons
were
not
allowed
to
charge
home
slade
captured
however
some
baggage
and
a
good
many
stragglers
marauders
and
guards
of
small
convoys
who
were
surprised
in
the
open
rolling
country
before
they
could
get
over
the
agueda
napier
iii
says
that
the
french
lost
men
which
contrasts
strangely
with
the
official
numbers
given
by
the
french
probably
drouet
gave
only
the
actual
loss
in
action
while
the
british
accounts
speak
of
all
the
stragglers
taken
that
day
as
if
they
had
been
captured
in
the
fight
the
certainly
got
prisoners
from
a
convoy
guard
wellington
could
now
surround
and
blockade
almeida
he
had
been
nourishing
some
hopes
that
the
french
might
evacuate
it
when
drouet
departed
from
its
neighbourhood
for
he
was
aware
that
its
stores
had
run
very
low
but
when
it
became
evident
that
the
place
was
not
to
be
abandoned
he
realized
that
it
would
take
some
weeks
to
reduce
it
for
he
had
no
whatever
indeed
there
were
no
heavy
guns
nearer
than
oporto
and
abrantes
it
was
not
till
the
following
autumn
that
a
proper
was
organized
for
the
army
almeida
could
only
be
attacked
by
the
weapon
of
famine
badajoz
which
was
beleaguered
at
the
same
time
had
to
be
battered
with
a
few
guns
borrowed
from
the
ramparts
of
the
neighbouring
fortress
of
elvas
the
british
army
had
now
been
two
years
in
portugal
yet
wellington
still
lacked
the
materials
for
conducting
the
smallest
offensive
operation
against
strongholds
in
the
hands
of
the
french
illustration
map
to
illustrate
the
last
stage
of
masséna
s
retreat
and
the
campaign
of
fuentes
de
oñoro
it
was
known
however
that
the
stores
in
almeida
had
run
low
for
the
corps
had
been
consuming
them
while
it
lay
close
by
in
spite
of
masséna
s
strict
directions
to
the
contrary
but
starvation
knows
no
laws
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
were
still
over
thirty
days
rations
in
the
magazines
though
it
had
been
reported
both
to
wellington
and
to
masséna
that
the
stock
had
run
down
much
lower
drouet
had
falsely
stated
on
one
occasion
that
there
was
only
enough
to
last
for
fifteen
days
the
british
general
fancied
that
four
weeks
blockade
might
reduce
the
place
and
thought
that
he
was
quit
of
the
army
of
portugal
for
a
much
longer
space
of
time
he
even
hoped
to
effect
something
against
ciudad
rodrigo
which
was
also
for
on
reaching
the
frontier
masséna
had
been
forced
to
indent
upon
it
for
supplies
for
his
broken
host
if
the
french
retired
to
salamanca
as
seemed
quite
probable
wellington
had
hopes
that
he
might
be
able
to
starve
out
rodrigo
but
he
was
not
intending
to
throw
his
troops
around
it
they
were
to
remain
on
the
dos
casas
and
the
azava
covering
the
siege
of
almeida
but
only
observing
the
spanish
fortress
with
cavalry
for
the
cutting
of
the
road
between
it
and
salamanca
only
irregular
forces
were
to
be
used
wellington
would
not
send
any
of
his
own
divisions
forward
beyond
rodrigo
but
requested
the
daring
and
resourceful
guerrillero
chief
julian
sanchez
to
throw
his
bands
in
this
direction
the
moment
that
the
french
army
should
have
retired
from
the
agueda
sanchez
had
been
for
many
months
already
occupied
in
similar
work
having
spent
all
the
winter
in
raids
to
cut
off
convoys
and
small
parties
passing
from
salamanca
to
ciudad
rodrigo
or
from
that
place
to
almeida
he
had
been
hunted
often
but
vainly
by
general
thiébault
the
governor
of
the
province
whose
columns
he
had
usually
succeeded
in
avoiding
while
he
was
always
at
hand
to
fall
on
weak
or
incautious
detachments
on
the
march
wellington
vii
but
as
he
wrote
to
beresford
on
april
i
was
not
very
sanguine
of
the
results
of
the
blockade
of
that
place
and
had
indeed
determined
not
to
make
it
in
any
strength
and
now
it
is
useless
to
keep
anybody
on
the
other
side
of
the
agueda
save
for
food
and
vii
for
the
state
of
in
which
sanchez
had
kept
ciudad
rodrigo
see
the
memoirs
of
the
duchess
of
abrantes
vii
pp
who
was
beleaguered
there
while
her
husband
was
in
portugal
for
the
hunts
organized
against
him
by
thiébault
see
the
latter
s
iv
sanchez
intercepted
numbers
of
dispatches
which
were
of
great
use
to
wellington
as
they
kept
him
informed
of
the
state
of
the
french
in
northern
spain
on
april
as
wellington
had
expected
the
army
of
portugal
resumed
its
march
into
the
interior
of
the
kingdom
of
leon
all
the
three
corps
passing
the
agueda
and
retiring
reynier
to
san
felices
el
grande
junot
to
santi
espiritus
loison
to
alba
de
yeltes
junot
while
passing
had
been
ordered
to
send
into
rodrigo
a
reinforcement
for
the
garrison
he
detached
a
battalion
of
the
and
another
of
the
irish
legion
which
brought
up
the
troops
in
the
place
to
men
from
the
to
the
the
retreat
continued
till
at
last
the
corps
went
into
cantonments
at
salamanca
alba
de
tormes
and
other
neighbouring
places
the
at
and
about
ledesma
and
the
at
toro
behind
the
others
drouet
and
his
two
divisions
held
the
line
of
observation
against
the
with
head
quarters
at
san
muñoz
so
ended
fifty
miles
within
the
borders
of
spain
the
movement
that
had
begun
at
santarem
and
punhete
the
effective
of
masséna
s
army
was
on
april
sabres
and
bayonets
it
had
started
in
september
with
officers
and
men
and
had
numbered
on
march
the
exact
loss
however
was
not
the
mere
difference
between
its
force
of
september
and
of
april
for
it
had
received
at
midwinter
two
drafts
under
gardanne
and
foy
amounting
to
men
in
all
on
the
other
hand
the
figures
of
april
do
not
include
two
convoys
of
sick
sent
back
into
spain
one
of
officers
and
men
dispatched
under
the
charge
of
drouet
from
the
alva
on
march
and
a
second
and
larger
one
sent
back
from
celorico
to
almeida
on
march
along
with
which
went
some
dismounted
cavalry
and
some
artillery
which
could
no
longer
follow
the
army
the
whole
may
have
amounted
to
men
both
of
these
convoys
dropped
large
numbers
of
dead
and
stragglers
by
the
way
but
it
is
impossible
to
ascertain
their
total
we
must
also
deduct
the
escort
of
an
officer
major
casabianca
sent
from
the
front
to
ciudad
rodrigo
on
january
who
took
men
with
him
and
never
returned
deducting
the
thus
sent
back
to
spain
and
setting
them
against
the
received
from
thence
it
appears
that
masséna
s
total
loss
must
have
been
just
under
men
or
per
cent
of
his
original
force
of
these
wellington
had
some
as
prisoners
including
the
captured
in
the
hospital
of
coimbra
on
october
the
remainder
had
perished
not
more
than
in
action
the
rest
by
the
sword
of
famine
wellington
s
scheme
had
justified
itself
though
its
working
out
had
taken
many
more
weeks
than
he
expected
nor
was
the
mere
loss
in
men
all
that
the
army
of
portugal
had
suffered
it
returned
to
leon
stripped
of
everything
without
munitions
uniforms
or
train
it
had
lost
horses
of
the
which
it
had
brought
into
portugal
and
practically
all
its
wheeled
vehicles
there
were
precisely
waggons
left
with
the
army
the
men
were
still
ready
to
fight
fiercely
when
they
saw
the
necessity
for
it
but
were
sulky
discontented
and
perpetually
carping
against
the
whose
last
unhappy
inspiration
the
projected
march
from
guarda
to
plasencia
had
filled
up
the
measure
of
their
wrath
and
indeed
they
had
good
reason
to
be
disgusted
at
it
for
it
was
wholly
insane
and
impracticable
but
every
misfortune
of
the
last
six
months
the
bloody
repulse
at
bussaco
the
loss
of
the
hospitals
and
magazines
at
coimbra
the
long
starvation
at
santarem
the
slow
and
circuitous
course
of
the
retreat
was
imputed
to
masséna
s
account
by
his
chief
subordinates
as
well
as
by
his
rank
and
file
what
the
generals
muttered
in
the
morning
was
loudly
discussed
around
every
at
night
the
whole
army
had
lost
in
morale
from
six
months
of
systematic
marauding
was
quite
out
of
hand
in
the
way
of
discipline
and
had
no
confidence
in
its
leader
who
was
absolutely
detested
the
departure
of
ney
who
was
liked
and
admired
by
all
ranks
had
been
a
great
discouragement
because
his
skilful
handling
of
the
rearguard
during
the
retreat
had
been
understood
and
appreciated
while
masséna
was
cried
down
as
a
tactician
no
less
than
as
a
strategist
on
the
general
results
of
the
campaign
a
general
whose
troops
no
longer
rely
on
him
can
not
get
the
best
out
of
his
army
and
for
this
reason
alone
napoleon
was
justified
in
removing
the
old
marshal
from
his
command
in
april
when
the
full
tale
of
the
retreat
had
reached
him
see
vol
iii
appendix
when
foy
went
back
from
thomar
on
march
to
rodrigo
his
escort
was
taken
from
the
corps
not
from
the
army
of
portugal
so
does
not
count
see
no
in
foy
s
yet
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
masséna
was
hardly
treated
that
the
expedition
of
portugal
failed
was
in
the
main
no
fault
of
his
neither
he
nor
his
master
nor
any
one
else
on
the
french
side
had
foreseen
wellington
s
plans
the
devastation
of
the
which
rendered
it
impossible
for
the
invader
to
live
long
by
marauding
and
the
systematic
fortification
of
the
long
front
of
the
lisbon
peninsula
for
the
actual
game
that
was
set
before
him
masséna
had
not
been
given
sufficient
pieces
by
the
emperor
as
wellington
had
said
more
than
a
year
before
the
french
could
not
turn
him
out
of
portugal
with
less
than
men
and
napoleon
had
only
provided
moreover
as
the
british
general
had
added
he
should
so
manage
affairs
that
french
could
not
live
in
the
country
if
they
did
appear
and
this
was
no
vain
boast
see
pp
of
vol
iii
masséna
then
was
sent
to
accomplish
an
impossible
task
and
his
merit
was
that
he
came
nearer
to
his
end
than
wellington
had
believed
possible
before
he
was
forced
to
recoil
many
of
the
french
marshals
would
never
have
got
to
coimbra
certainly
none
of
them
would
have
succeeded
in
holding
on
at
santarem
for
three
months
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
prince
of
essling
did
not
exaggerate
when
he
wrote
to
berthier
on
march
that
it
was
his
own
iron
will
alone
which
had
kept
the
army
so
long
and
so
far
to
the
front
that
but
for
him
it
would
have
recoiled
on
to
spain
many
weeks
earlier
his
heroic
obstinacy
gave
his
adversary
many
an
uneasy
day
while
it
seemed
in
january
and
february
as
if
the
calculation
for
famishing
the
french
had
failed
masséna
in
short
had
done
all
that
was
possible
and
the
general
failure
of
the
campaign
was
not
his
fault
any
more
than
it
was
that
of
soult
on
whom
the
blame
has
always
been
laid
by
the
elder
marshal
s
advocates
we
have
shown
in
an
earlier
chapter
that
soult
did
all
and
more
than
all
that
napoleon
had
directed
him
to
accomplish
if
he
had
literally
obeyed
the
tardy
orders
that
reached
him
from
paris
he
would
only
have
exposed
the
corps
to
defeat
if
not
to
destruction
the
post
rebukes
that
the
emperor
sent
him
were
unjust
we
are
once
more
driven
back
to
our
old
conclusion
that
the
determining
factors
in
the
failure
of
the
campaign
of
portugal
were
firstly
that
napoleon
refused
to
appoint
a
single
in
the
peninsula
to
whose
orders
all
the
other
marshals
should
be
strictly
subordinate
and
secondly
that
he
persisted
in
sending
plans
and
directions
from
paris
founded
on
facts
that
were
seven
weeks
late
or
more
when
his
dispatches
reached
the
front
on
this
we
have
enlarged
at
sufficient
length
on
an
earlier
page

in

joseph
and
his
troubles
while
following
the
fortunes
of
wellington
and
masséna
during
the
first
four
months
of
we
have
been
compelled
to
leave
almost
untouched
the
sequence
of
events
in
the
rest
of
spain
not
only
the
doings
of
suchet
and
macdonald
in
the
far
east
which
had
no
practical
connexion
with
the
campaign
of
portugal
but
also
the
minor
affairs
of
the
southern
and
central
provinces
only
soult
s
expedition
to
estremadura
which
came
into
close
touch
with
wellington
has
been
dealt
with
it
is
time
to
explain
the
general
posture
of
the
war
in
the
peninsula
during
the
time
when
its
critical
point
lay
between
lisbon
and
abrantes
where
masséna
and
wellington
stood
face
to
face
each
waiting
for
the
other
to
move
what
was
going
on
in
portugal
was
as
we
have
already
seen
practically
a
secret
to
the
french
in
spain
for
the
portuguese
ordenança
and
the
spanish
guerrilleros
had
done
their
work
of
blocking
the
roads
so
well
that
no
accurate
information
penetrated
to
madrid
valladolid
or
seville
from
santarem
it
was
only
at
rare
intervals
when
foy
and
other
officers
cut
their
way
through
this
fog
of
war
that
the
condition
of
affairs
on
the
tagus
became
known
for
a
moment
the
fog
descended
again
when
they
had
passed
through
on
their
way
to
paris
and
given
their
information
as
to
the
fortunes
of
the
army
of
portugal
during
the
weeks
that
preceded
their
departure
the
gaps
in
the
narrative
were
very
long
nothing
got
through
between
the
departure
of
masséna
from
almeida
on
september
and
foy
s
first
arrival
at
ciudad
rodrigo
on
november
there
was
another
lacuna
in
the
knowledge
of
the
situation
between
that
date
and
the
passage
of
masséna
s
second
successful
messenger
casabianca
from
santarem
to
rodrigo
in
the
earliest
days
of
february
and
after
casabianca
had
passed
by
the
next
news
came
out
through
foy
s
second
mission
when
he
started
to
announce
the
oncoming
retreat
on
march
and
got
to
the
borders
of
leon
on
march
the
only
way
in
which
king
joseph
at
madrid
or
the
generals
of
the
military
governments
of
old
castile
or
soult
in
andalusia
felt
the
course
of
the
war
on
its
most
important
theatre
was
that
they
were
for
many
months
freed
from
any
anxiety
about
the
movements
of
wellington
he
was
contained
by
masséna
and
however
he
might
be
faring
he
had
no
power
to
interfere
by
armed
force
in
the
affairs
of
spain
the
french
for
all
this
time
had
to
deal
only
with
the
armies
of
the
cortes
and
with
their
old
and
irrepressible
enemies
the
guerrilleros
of
the
mountains
while
the
fate
of
the
portuguese
expedition
was
still
uncertain
while
it
seemed
possible
to
napoleon
that
masséna
might
cling
to
his
position
at
santarem
till
soult
came
up
to
join
him
on
the
tagus
a
considerable
change
was
made
with
regard
to
the
french
troops
in
northern
spain
convinced
at
last
there
was
little
to
be
said
in
favour
of
that
system
of
many
small
military
governments
in
old
castile
and
the
neighbouring
provinces
which
he
had
created
in
the
emperor
resolved
to
put
them
all
under
a
single
commander
this
would
give
him
six
less
independent
generals
to
communicate
with
and
would
ensure
for
the
future
a
much
better
between
the
divisions
which
occupied
the
valley
of
the
douro
and
the
pyrenean
regions
the
six
military
governors
had
been
each
playing
his
own
game
and
taking
little
notice
of
that
of
his
neighbours
their
enemies
were
mostly
the
guerrillero
bands
of
the
cantabrian
hills
and
of
navarre
each
general
did
his
best
to
hunt
these
elusive
enemies
out
of
his
own
department
but
took
little
heed
of
their
trespasses
on
his
neighbours
territory
evasive
and
indomitable
partisans
like
mina
in
navarre
julian
sanchez
in
old
castile
and
porlier
and
longa
in
the
cantabrian
sierras
found
it
comparatively
easy
to
shift
their
positions
when
the
pressure
on
one
region
was
too
great
for
them
and
to
move
on
into
another
they
were
sure
that
the
hunt
would
soon
slacken
and
that
they
could
return
at
their
leisure
to
their
old
haunts
the
emperor
thought
that
it
would
be
possible
to
make
an
end
of
them
if
all
his
garrisons
and
movable
columns
in
northern
spain
were
put
under
a
single
commander
and
moved
in
unison
under
a
single
will
hence
came
the
decree
of
january
creating
the
army
of
the
north
and
handing
it
over
to
marshal
bessières
whose
name
was
still
remembered
in
those
regions
owing
to
his
old
victory
of
medina
de
rio
seco
his
authority
extended
over
the
troops
stationed
in
navarre
biscay
burgos
valladolid
salamanca
the
asturias
and
santander
including
not
only
the
regular
garrisons
of
those
provinces
but
the
two
divisions
of
the
young
guard
which
had
replaced
drouet
s
corps
in
old
castile
and
the
division
under
serras
which
watched
galicia
from
the
direction
of
benavente
and
astorga
the
total
of
the
forces
placed
under
his
orders
amounted
to
men
of
whom
were
présents
sous
les
armes
the
rest
being
in
hospital
or
detached
outside
the
limits
of
the
territory
assigned
to
the
army
of
the
north
considerable
as
was
this
force
it
did
not
accomplish
all
that
the
emperor
hoped
even
when
directed
by
a
single
commander
of
solid
military
talents
bessières
though
a
capable
officer
was
not
a
genius
and
the
tasks
assigned
to
him
were
so
multifarious
that
after
a
short
time
he
began
to
grow
harassed
and
worried
and
to
cavil
at
every
order
that
was
sent
him
he
was
directed
to
suppress
brigandage
to
put
down
the
guerrilleros
to
support
the
army
of
portugal
against
wellington
whenever
necessary
to
keep
an
eye
upon
the
spanish
regular
forces
in
galicia
and
the
asturias
this
he
declared
was
more
than
could
be
accomplished
with
the
forces
at
his
disposal
if
i
concentrate
men
all
communications
are
lost
and
the
insurgents
will
make
enormous
progress
the
coast
would
be
lost
as
far
as
bilbao
we
are
without
resources
because
it
is
only
with
the
greatest
pains
that
the
troops
can
be
fed
from
day
to
day
the
spirit
of
the
population
is
abominably
bad
the
retreat
of
the
army
of
portugal
has
turned
their
heads
the
bands
of
insurgents
grow
larger
and
recruit
themselves
actively
on
every
side
the
emperor
is
deceived
about
spain
the
pacification
of
spain
does
not
depend
on
a
battle
with
the
english
who
will
accept
it
or
refuse
it
as
they
please
and
who
have
portugal
behind
them
for
retreat
every
one
knows
the
vicious
system
of
our
operations
every
one
allows
that
we
are
too
widely
scattered
we
occupy
too
much
territory
we
use
up
our
resources
without
profit
and
without
necessity
we
are
clinging
on
to
dreams
cadiz
and
badajoz
absorb
all
our
means
cadiz
because
we
can
not
take
it
badajoz
because
it
requires
a
whole
army
to
support
it
we
ought
to
blow
up
badajoz
and
to
abandon
the
siege
of
cadiz
for
the
present
we
ought
to
draw
in
get
solid
bases
for
our
magazines
and
hospitals
and
regard
of
spain
as
a
vast
battlefield
which
a
battle
may
give
us
or
cause
us
to
lose
till
the
moment
that
we
change
our
system
and
take
in
hand
the
real
conquest
and
pacification
of
the
country
bessières
to
berthier
printed
in
the
appendix
to
belmas
vol
all
this
means
that
bessières
found
it
impossible
to
pacify
the
north
and
concluded
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
complete
the
conquest
of
andalusia
or
portugal
when
that
of
navarre
and
santander
was
so
far
from
being
secure
that
no
small
party
could
go
two
miles
from
a
garrison
town
without
a
large
probability
of
being
cut
off
by
the
insurgents
he
would
have
had
his
master
abandon
andalusia
and
estremadura
in
order
to
concentrate
such
masses
of
troops
in
the
north
that
the
guerrilleros
should
be
smothered
by
mere
numbers
that
every
mountain
village
should
have
its
garrison
there
was
small
likelihood
that
his
views
would
find
favour
at
paris
the
emperor
knew
well
enough
the
effect
on
his
prestige
that
would
result
from
the
abandonment
of
the
siege
of
cadiz
following
upon
the
retreat
of
masséna
from
santarem
it
would
look
like
a
confession
of
defeat
a
renunciation
of
the
great
game
of
conquest
if
the
french
armies
retired
beyond
the
sierra
morena
the
results
of
eighteen
months
of
victorious
campaigning
in
the
south
would
be
lost
and
the
cortes
at
cadiz
would
once
more
have
a
realm
to
administer
hence
all
that
napoleon
did
for
bessières
was
to
send
him
in
june
two
new
divisions
for
the
strengthening
of
the
garrisons
of
the
north
and
to
bid
him
fortify
every
important
station
on
the
to
madrid
and
even
the
main
bridges
of
the
upper
ebro
a
few
months
later
he
recalled
him
partly
because
he
considered
him
a
pessimist
partly
because
bessières
quarrelled
with
king
joseph
who
was
continually
soliciting
his
removal
but
before
the
duke
of
istria
departed
he
had
many
more
troubles
to
go
through
as
will
be
seen
see
below
divisions
souham
and
caffarelli
the
main
difficulties
of
the
army
of
the
north
arose
from
geographical
facts
while
the
plains
of
leon
and
old
castile
could
be
scoured
by
cavalry
and
easily
traversed
by
flying
columns
so
that
it
was
not
impossible
to
keep
some
sort
of
order
in
them
this
flat
upland
was
bordered
on
the
north
by
the
long
chain
of
the
cantabrian
sierras
and
their
broad
rugged
and
nearly
roadless
behind
these
again
lay
the
narrow
and
difficult
of
asturias
and
santander
cut
up
into
countless
petty
valleys
each
drained
by
its
own
small
river
and
parted
from
its
neighbours
by
spurs
of
the
great
sierras
how
was
this
mountain
region
seventy
miles
broad
and
two
hundred
long
to
be
dealt
with
the
french
had
no
permanent
garrisons
on
the
coast
between
gijon
the
port
of
oviedo
which
was
generally
occupied
by
a
detachment
of
bonnet
s
division
and
santander
not
far
from
the
borders
of
biscay
this
last
bessières
describes
as
a
bad
post
from
every
point
of
view
only
to
be
defended
by
covering
it
with
large
bodies
of
troops
and
only
accessible
by
a
series
of
difficult
defiles
in
the
cantabrian
highlands
dwelt
longa
and
porlier
with
bands
which
had
assumed
the
proportions
of
small
armies
they
could
communicate
with
the
sea
at
any
one
of
a
dozen
petty
ports
and
draw
arms
and
supplies
from
the
british
cruisers
of
the
bay
of
biscay
even
mina
would
occasionally
get
in
touch
with
the
sea
through
this
though
his
main
sphere
of
operations
was
in
navarre
there
were
dozens
of
smaller
bands
each
based
on
its
own
valley
but
capable
of
joining
its
neighbours
for
a
sudden
stroke
again
and
again
french
columns
worked
up
into
these
sierras
from
the
plain
of
the
douro
and
went
on
a
hunt
after
the
patriots
sometimes
they
caught
them
and
inflicted
severe
loss
more
often
they
were
eluded
by
their
enemies
who
fled
by
paths
that
regular
troops
could
not
follow
into
some
distant
corner
of
the
mountains
it
was
impossible
to
garrison
each
upland
valley
with
a
force
that
could
resist
a
general
levy
of
the
insurgents
even
little
towns
like
potes
in
the
liebana
longa
s
usual
head
quarters
which
were
repeatedly
taken
could
not
be
kept
the
army
of
the
north
would
have
required
men
instead
of
the
whom
bessières
actually
commanded
if
it
was
to
master
the
whole
of
this
difficult
region
indeed
cantabria
could
only
have
been
conquered
by
an
enemy
possessing
a
sea
force
to
attack
it
in
the
rear
and
occupy
all
its
little
ports
as
well
as
an
overwhelming
land
army
operating
from
all
sides
to
the
end
of
the
war
longa
and
porlier
often
hunted
but
never
destroyed
maintained
themselves
without
any
great
difficulty
in
their
fastnesses
nothing
but
the
general
despair
and
demoralization
that
might
have
followed
the
extinction
of
the
patriotic
cause
in
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
spain
could
have
brought
the
war
in
this
region
to
an
end
nothing
of
the
kind
occurred
the
cantabrians
kept
a
high
spirit
they
won
many
small
successes
and
they
were
perpetually
helped
by
the
british
from
the
side
of
the
sea
bessières
had
a
hopeless
problem
before
him
in
this
quarter
considering
the
size
of
his
army
bessières
soon
after
his
arrival
put
a
garrison
in
santoña
between
santander
and
bilbao
but
this
was
not
his
only
trouble
bonnet
in
asturias
was
holding
oviedo
and
the
district
immediately
round
it
with
a
strong
division
which
varied
at
one
time
and
another
from
to
men
he
was
very
useful
in
his
present
position
because
he
cut
the
spanish
line
of
defence
along
the
north
coast
in
two
and
because
he
seemed
to
threaten
galicia
from
the
the
threat
was
not
a
very
real
one
for
he
had
not
enough
men
to
deliver
an
attack
on
eastern
galicia
and
at
the
same
time
to
hold
oviedo
and
its
neighbourhood
but
he
was
a
source
of
trouble
as
well
as
of
strength
to
his
superiors
for
it
was
very
difficult
to
keep
in
touch
with
him
through
the
pass
of
pajares
and
if
he
were
to
be
attacked
at
once
by
the
galicians
and
by
a
british
his
position
would
be
a
very
dangerous
one
he
had
been
put
to
great
trouble
by
renovales
s
naval
expedition
in
october
though
this
was
but
a
small
force
and
had
not
received
any
real
help
from
galicia
along
the
land
side
bessières
after
he
had
been
a
few
months
in
authority
was
inclined
to
withdraw
bonnet
to
the
south
side
of
the
sierras
and
to
abandon
oviedo
but
was
warned
against
such
a
move
by
his
master
who
said
that
this
would
be
a
detestable
operation
as
it
would
relieve
galicia
from
the
threat
of
invasion
allow
of
the
of
a
junta
and
an
army
in
asturias
and
necessitate
a
heavy
concentration
at
santander
nevertheless
the
marshal
did
at
one
crisis
withdraw
the
division
from
oviedo
see
vol
iii
pp
no
june
between
bonnet
in
the
asturias
and
ciudad
rodrigo
the
long
front
against
galicia
was
occupied
by
a
single
weak
french
division
that
of
serras
whose
head
quarters
were
at
benavente
his
advanced
post
at
astorga
and
his
at
leon
and
zamora
if
the
army
of
galicia
had
been
in
good
order
this
force
would
have
been
in
great
danger
for
it
was
not
strong
enough
to
hold
the
ground
allotted
to
it
but
when
del
parque
in
drew
off
to
estremadura
the
old
army
of
the
north
he
had
left
behind
him
only
a
few
skeleton
corps
and
the
best
of
these
had
been
destroyed
in
defending
astorga
in
the
following
year
the
formation
of
a
new
galician
army
of
men
had
been
decreed
and
the
left
behind
in
the
country
had
been
filled
up
in
but
the
results
were
not
satisfactory
the
mahy
was
a
man
of
little
energy
and
spent
most
of
it
in
quarrels
with
the
local
junta
whom
he
accused
of
conspiracy
against
him
and
charged
with
secret
correspondence
with
la
romana
and
his
party
he
seized
their
letters
in
the
post
and
imprisoned
two
members
whereupon
riots
broke
out
and
complaints
were
sent
to
the
regency
at
cadiz
this
led
to
mahy
s
recall
and
the
was
given
to
the
duke
of
albuquerque
then
on
his
mission
to
london
he
died
without
having
returned
to
spain
so
that
the
appointment
was
nugatory
and
the
regency
then
gave
it
to
castaños
who
was
at
the
same
time
made
of
estremadura
after
the
death
of
la
romana
and
the
disaster
at
the
gebora
castaños
went
to
the
tagus
to
rally
the
poor
remnants
of
the
estremaduran
army
and
while
retaining
the
nominal
command
in
galicia
never
visited
that
province
but
deputed
the
command
in
it
to
santocildes
the
young
general
who
had
so
bravely
defended
astorga
in
the
preceding
spring
he
had
been
sent
prisoner
to
france
but
was
adroit
enough
to
escape
from
his
captivity
and
to
make
his
way
back
to
corunna
his
appointment
was
popular
but
he
got
no
great
service
out
of
the
galician
army
which
was
in
a
deplorable
condition
and
hopelessly
scattered
the
junta
kept
many
battalions
to
garrison
the
of
corunna
vigo
and
ferrol
and
the
main
body
whose
head
quarters
lay
at
villafranca
in
the
vierzo
did
not
amount
to
more
than
men
destitute
of
cavalry
which
galicia
could
never
produce
and
very
poorly
provided
with
artillery
there
was
another
division
under
general
cabrera
some
strong
at
puebla
de
senabria
and
a
third
under
barcena
and
losada
on
the
borders
of
the
asturias
opposite
bonnet
the
whole
did
not
amount
to
raw
troops
yet
this
was
sufficient
to
hold
serras
in
observation
and
to
watch
bonnet
who
was
too
much
distracted
by
the
cantabrian
bands
to
be
really
dangerous
but
in
the
spring
of
the
galicians
could
do
no
more
and
wellington
was
much
chagrined
to
find
that
he
could
get
no
effective
assistance
from
them
after
he
had
driven
masséna
behind
the
agueda
and
so
shaken
the
hold
of
the
french
on
the
whole
kingdom
of
leon
it
was
not
till
june
that
santocildes
found
it
possible
to
descend
from
the
hills
and
threaten
serras
this
led
to
a
petty
campaign
about
astorga
and
on
the
orbigo
river
which
will
be
narrated
in
its
due
place
since
the
disaster
at
puebla
de
senabria
vol
iii
serras
had
drawn
in
his
left
flank
and
abandoned
the
galician
while
affairs
stood
thus
in
the
north
king
joseph
and
his
army
of
the
centre
were
profiting
for
many
months
from
the
absence
of
any
danger
upon
the
side
of
portugal
indeed
the
period
between
september
and
april
were
the
least
disturbed
of
any
in
the
short
and
troublous
reign
of
the
so
far
as
regular
military
affairs
went
there
was
no
enemy
to
face
save
the
guerrilleros
yet
these
bold
partisans
of
whom
the
best
known
were
the
empecinado
and
el
medico
juan
palarea
on
the
side
of
the
eastern
mountains
and
julian
sanchez
more
to
the
west
on
the
borders
of
leon
sufficed
to
keep
the
men
of
whom
king
joseph
could
dispose
in
constant
employment
such
a
force
was
not
too
much
when
every
small
town
almost
every
village
of
new
castile
had
to
be
provided
with
a
garrison
roughly
speaking
each
province
absorbed
a
division
the
germans
of
the
occupied
la
mancha
lahoussaye
s
dragoons
and
the
incomplete
division
of
dessolles
held
toledo
and
its
district
the
king
s
spaniards
the
guadalajara
country
leaving
only
the
royal
guards
and
some
drafts
and
detachments
to
garrison
the
capital
it
was
with
considerable
difficulty
that
joseph
collected
in
january
a
small
expeditionary
force
of
not
over
men
with
which
lahoussaye
went
out
partly
to
open
up
communications
with
soult
in
estremadura
but
more
especially
to
search
for
any
traces
of
the
vanished
army
of
masséna
in
the
direction
of
the
portuguese
frontier
lahoussaye
started
from
talavera
on
february
communicated
by
means
of
his
cavalry
with
soult
s
outposts
between
truxillo
and
merida
and
then
went
northward
across
the
tagus
to
plasencia
from
which
his
cavalry
searched
in
vain
as
far
as
coria
and
alcantara
for
any
news
of
the
army
of
portugal
from
plasencia
he
was
soon
driven
back
to
toledo
by
want
of
supplies
joseph
had
directed
him
to
seize
alcantara
its
broken
bridge
and
place
a
garrison
there
but
this
turned
out
to
be
absolutely
impossible
for
it
would
have
been
useless
to
leave
a
small
force
in
this
remote
spot
when
it
was
certain
that
it
must
ere
long
retire
for
lack
of
food
and
might
well
be
cut
off
by
the
guerrilleros
before
it
could
reach
talavera
the
nearest
occupied
point
the
king
in
all
his
dispatches
seems
to
understate
his
own
force
he
sometimes
calls
it
only
men
but
a
muster
roll
of
the
army
of
the
centre
which
i
have
copied
from
the
archives
de
la
guerre
for
february
shows
a
total
of
viz
dessolles
german
division
spaniards
lahoussaye
treillard
s
light
cavalry
artillery
train
sappers
royal
guards
of
all
arms
in
addition
there
were
drafts
for
soult
detained
in
new
castile
but
about
to
start
for
seville
which
had
only
seven
battalions
the
rest
being
with
soult
in
andalusia
composed
of
two
cavalry
regiments
of
marisy
s
brigade
three
german
battalions
from
la

and
two
french
battalions
napoleon
in
a
dispatch
of
march
xxi
blames
lahoussaye
for
not
stopping
in
northern
estremadura
in
touch
with
soult
the
army
of
the
centre
just
sufficed
to
occupy
the
kingdom
of
new
castile
and
was
unable
to
do
more
at
least
however
it
could
maintain
its
position
and
was
in
no
danger
the
king
was
even
able
to
make
state
visits
to
places
in
the
close
neighbourhood
of
madrid
such
as
alcala
and
guadalajara
and
seems
to
have
regarded
the
possibility
of
such
a
modest
tour
as
a
sign
of
the
approaching
pacification
of
this
region
see
miot
de
melito
s
iii
but
just
at
the
moment
when
joseph
bonaparte
s
military
situation
was
safe
if
not
satisfactory
he
was
passing
through
a
diplomatic
crisis
which
absorbed
all
his
attention
and
reduced
him
to
the
verge
of
despair
we
have
already
alluded
in
an
earlier
chapter
to
napoleon
s
insane
resolve
to
annex
all
spain
beyond
the
ebro
to
the
french
empire
in
return
for
which
he
was
proposing
to
hand
over
portugal
when
it
should
be
conquered
to
his
brother
the
proclamation
announcing
this
strange
resolve
which
was
to
make
frenchmen
of
mina
and
all
the
guerrilleros
of
navarre
no
less
than
of
the
catalan
armies
which
were
still
striving
so
hard
against
macdonald
was
delayed
in
publication
for
the
emperor
wished
to
wait
till
lisbon
was
in
the
hands
of
masséna
before
he
made
known
his
purpose
but
joseph
was
aware
that
the
proclamation
had
been
drawn
up
and
had
been
sent
out
to
the
governors
of
the
northern
provinces
who
were
only
waiting
for
orders
to
issue
it
the
news
that
the
english
had
evacuated
portugal
might
any
day
arrive
and
would
be
the
signal
for
the
dismemberment
of
spain
he
had
sent
in
succession
to
paris
his
two
most
trusted
spanish
adherents
the
duke
of
and
the
marquis
of
almenara
to
beg
the
emperor
to
forgo
his
purpose
all
was
to
no
effect
came
back
in
december
absolutely
crushed
by
the
reception
that
he
had
been
given
the
emperor
had
delivered
to
him
an
angry
diatribe
in
which
he
complained
that
his
brother
forgot
that
he
was
a
french
prince
and
remarked
that
many
other
european
sovereigns
who
had
received
much
harder
measure
did
not
make
nearly
so
much
noise
about
it
as
the
king
of
spain
almenara
reached
madrid
about
a
week
later
to
report
an
equally
characteristic
interview
with
napoleon
he
had
been
directed
to
inform
his
master
that
he
should
be
given
one
more
chance
let
him
open
negotiations
with
the
cortes
at
cadiz
making
them
the
offer
that
if
they
would
recognize
him
as
king
of
spain
he
would
recognize
them
as
lawful
representatives
of
the
nation
and
rule
them
according
to
the
constitution
drawn
up
at
bayonne
cadiz
and
the
other
fortresses
held
by
the
troops
of
the
regency
must
open
their
gates
and
napoleon
would
then
promise
to
make
no
annexations
of
spanish
soil
he
would
even
guarantee
the
integrity
of
the
kingdom
if
the
cortes
refused
to
treat
the
emperor
would
regard
himself
as
free
from
any
previous
engagements
made
with
his
brother
or
the
spanish
nation
the
provinces
beyond
the
ebro
would
become
part
of
france
he
added
that
if
affairs
in
portugal
went
badly
it
would
not
be
wise
to
open
negotiations
with
cadiz
at
all
for
fear
that
the
spaniards
might
take
the
mere
fact
that
proposals
had
been
made
to
them
as
a
token
of
growing
fear
and
depression
on
the
part
of
joseph
see
vol
iii
pp
see
miot
s
iii
for
the
discouraging
results
of
this
embassy
the
king
and
his
ministers
knew
well
the
impracticability
of
making
any
offer
to
the
government
of
cadiz
which
with
all
its
faults
and
internal
dissensions
was
determined
to
fight
to
the
death
and
had
never
shown
the
least
intention
of
recognizing
napoleon
s
nominee
as
king
of
spain
they
looked
upon
the
scheme
as
merely
a
preliminary
to
the
publication
of
the
edict
for
the
annexation
of
the
provinces
beyond
the
ebro
king
joseph
was
to
be
made
to
demonstrate
his
own
futility
since
he
would
receive
an
angry
and
contemptuous
reply
or
no
reply
at
all
and
it
would
then
be
open
to
his
brother
to
declare
that
the
attempt
to
govern
a
united
spain
by
a
king
had
failed
and
that
it
was
necessary
to
dismember
it
perhaps
to
cut
it
up
into
a
number
of
french
military
governments
this
seems
to
have
been
joseph
s
own
impression
in
the
council
at
which
the
emperor
s
proposal
was
discussed
he
broke
out
into
violent
reproaches
and
bitter
complaints
against
his
brother
and
explained
with
tears
to
his
ministers
that
he
and
they
were
betrayed
he
was
now
for
abdicating
and
this
would
have
been
the
most
dignified
course
to
take
he
talked
of
buying
an
estate
in
france
and
settling
down
far
from
paris
as
a
private
person
he
had
indeed
charged
his
wife
s
nephew
marius
clary
to
cross
the
pyrenees
and
purchase
a
castle
and
lands
for
him
in
touraine
or
the
south
where
he
might
hide
his
disgrace
and
disappointment
this
move
provoked
napoleon
s
wrath
he
signified
his
displeasure
the
members
of
the
imperial
family
could
not
legally
make
any
acquisition
of
land
in
france
without
the
formal
consent
of
the
emperor
in
addition
it
was
impossible
for
the
king
of
spain
or
the
commander
of
the
army
of
the
centre
to
quit
his
post
without
having
received
the
imperial
authorization
painful
as
the
declaration
must
be
if
the
king
took
such
a
hazardous
step
he
should
be
arrested
at
bayonne
on
crossing
the
frontier
there
must
be
no
more
talk
about
the
constitution
of
bayonne
the
emperor
could
dispose
of
spain
at
his
good
pleasure
and
in
the
interests
of
the
french
empire
if
joseph
persisted
in
the
idea
of
abdication
he
must
first
make
a
formal
statement
to
that
effect
to
the
french
ambassador
at
madrid
and
provided
that
it
was
considered
that
the
step
would
cause
no
dangerous
results
nor
give
rise
to
any
slanderous
reports
he
might
come
to
his
estate
of
morfontaine
near
paris
and
finish
the
matter
all
this
from
the
letter
of
the
queen
of
spain
detailing
her
interview
with
the
duc
de
cadore
who
sent
for
her
in
the
emperor
s
name
on
january
and
administered
this
bitter
message
to
her
for
her
husband
s
benefit
see
the
letter
given
in
miot
s
iii
cf
napoleon
s
dispatch
to
laforest
ambassador
at
madrid
joseph
at
first
seemed
inclined
to
accept
any
terms
by
which
he
might
emerge
from
his
present
ignominious
position
and
actually
had
several
interviews
with
laforest
in
which
they
discussed
the
drafting
of
a
deed
of
abdication
but
it
seemed
that
napoleon
would
prefer
the
prolongation
of
the
present
state
of
affairs
and
for
his
own
purposes
intended
that
a
puppet
king
should
continue
at
madrid
by
the
ambassador
s
advice
the
document
ultimately
took
the
shape
of
a
letter
in
which
joseph
instead
of
abdicating
in
definitive
form
merely
stated
his
wish
to
do
so
and
referred
it
to
his
brother
his
confidant
miot
de
melito
with
whom
he
talked
over
the
whole
matter
expresses
his
opinion
that
at
the
last
moment
the
fascination
of
the
crown
overpowered
his
master
s
full
sense
of
resentment
the
king
s
note
was
a
good
piece
of
writing
but
i
consider
that
it
did
not
state
clearly
enough
that
the
course
to
which
he
inclined
and
which
he
preferred
to
all
others
was
abdication
i
wished
that
he
had
made
a
stronger
affirmation
of
this
and
told
him
so
but
to
no
effect
it
was
easy
to
see
that
the
name
of
king
had
still
a
powerful
attraction
from
which
joseph
could
not
escape
and
i
wondered
at
the
glamour
and
intoxication
which
as
it
seems
hangs
about
supreme
power
since
the
mere
shadow
of
that
power
could
overweigh
with
him
so
many
rebuffs
and
so
much
resentment
miot
s
iii
napoleon
made
no
reply
to
his
brother
s
declaration
he
had
no
intention
of
taking
over
the
formal
responsibility
for
the
government
of
spain
and
preferred
to
leave
another
to
answer
for
all
its
obvious
injustices
and
oppressions
affairs
were
at
a
standstill
for
some
months
till
in
april
joseph
taking
the
opportunity
of
a
formal
invitation
to
become
one
of
the
godfathers
of
the
king
of
rome
the
heir
of
the
empire
made
a
sudden
and
unauthorized
sally
to
paris
he
started
from
madrid
on
april
accompanied
by
nine
of
his
courtiers
and
ministers
and
crossed
the
bidassoa
into
france
on
may
he
made
no
halt
at
bayonne
lest
he
should
be
stopped
there
by
orders
from
his
brother
and
when
at
dax
in
gascony
he
received
an
imperial
dispatch
forbidding
him
to
quit
spain
he
was
able
to
plead
that
it
was
too
late
to
act
upon
it
pursuing
his
journey
night
and
day
he
presented
himself
at
paris
on
may
and
announced
to
napoleon
that
he
was
come
to
discharge
in
person
the
honourable
duties
of
at
the
approaching
baptism
of
his
nephew
though
annoyed
at
the
king
s
arrival
for
refusals
and
evasions
of
a
brother
s
petitions
are
transacted
more
easily
by
letter
than
face
to
face
the
emperor
thought
it
well
to
make
no
open
show
of
displeasure
and
accepted
all
the
explanations
given
to
him
there
followed
a
series
of
interviews
at
rambouillet
in
which
joseph
allowed
himself
to
be
talked
out
of
his
project
of
abdication
for
the
emperor
declared
that
he
found
him
useful
in
his
present
position
and
informed
him
that
it
was
his
duty
as
a
brother
and
a
french
prince
to
obey
the
directions
of
the
head
of
his
house
in
return
napoleon
promised
to
make
many
arrangements
which
would
render
the
king
s
position
less
intolerable
than
it
had
been
for
the
last
year
he
would
provide
him
with
a
monthly
subsidy
of
a
million
francs
from
the
french
treasury
of
which
half
would
be
for
the
sustenance
of
his
court
and
ministers
and
the
other
half
for
the
pay
of
the
army
of
the
centre
orders
were
issued
to
soult
commanding
the
army
of
andalusia
bessières
commanding
the
army
of
the
north
and
suchet
so
far
as
the
army
of
aragon
was
concerned
but
not
for
catalonia
by
which
they
were
directed
to
pay
over
to
a
commissary
appointed
by
joseph
one
quarter
of
the
gross
revenues
which
they
were
raising
in
the
districts
which
they
occupied
they
were
also
directed
to
leave
the
law
courts
in
the
king
s
hands
and
not
to
allow
judgements
to
be
given
in
the
name
of
the
emperor
it
was
this
last
practice
frequently
adopted
by
kellermann
in
castile
which
had
irritated
joseph
more
than
any
other
misdemeanour
of
the
local
commandants
what
joseph
most
desired
a
real
directing
power
over
the
movements
of
all
the
french
troops
in
spain
was
not
given
him
but
he
was
granted
a
sort
of
illusory
superintending
authority
if
he
was
at
the
head
quarters
of
any
of
the
armies
he
was
to
be
given
the
honours
of
supreme
command
all
the
marshals
and
generals
commanding
armies
were
to
send
him
frequent
reports
and
not
to
undertake
any
operations
without
informing
him
of
them
the
king
must
have
reports
of
everything
that
happens
he
must
know
everything
and
be
able
to
act
in
his
central
position
as
a
sort
of
agency
for
transmitting
information
to
the
generals
this
communication
of
intelligence
observations
and
advice
may
even
take
place
through
his
spanish
minister
of
war
wrote
the
emperor
the
king
flattered
himself
that
this
meagre
concession
gave
him
something
like
a
directing
authority
over
the
armies
he
told
his
courtiers
that
he
was
given
the
position
of
and
used
his
brother
s
permission
to
send
advice
in
reams
to
each
of
the
local
commanders
unfortunately
there
was
no
way
of
making
them
take
this
advice
they
answered
more
or
less
politely
showing
reasons
why
they
could
not
follow
it
and
went
on
their
own
ways
as
before
it
was
to
no
effect
that
joseph
got
leave
to
have
his
old
friend
marshal
jourdan
sent
back
to
him
first
as
governor
of
madrid
and
later
as
chief
of
the
staff
he
flattered
himself
that
his
dispatches
would
be
taken
more
seriously
by
soult
or
suchet
when
they
came
countersigned
by
a
marshal
of
france
but
he
erred
for
the
younger
commanders
looked
upon
jourdan
as
effete
and
past
his
prime
nor
were
they
altogether
wrong
napoleon
to
berthier
from
caen
may
no
see
miot
de
melito
s
iii
and
compare
it
with
the
actual
terms
of
napoleon
s
concession
given
in
his
letter
to
berthier
quoted
above
nothing
can
be
more
curious
than
the
emperor
s
memorandum
to
berthier
which
directs
him
to
lay
these
conditions
before
joseph
i
am
thus
he
writes
satisfying
the
desires
which
the
king
expressed
to
me
save
on
the
single
point
of
the
supreme
command
over
my
troops
i
can
not
give
away
that
supreme
command
because
i
do
not
see
any
man
capable
of
managing
the
troops
and
yet
the
command
ought
to
be
one
and
indivisible
in
the
note
which
the
king
gave
me
all
the
arrangements
were
complex
and
confused
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things
that
if
one
marshal
were
placed
at
madrid
and
directed
all
operations
he
would
want
to
have
all
the
glory
along
with
all
the
responsibility
the
commanders
of
the
armies
of
the
south
and
of
portugal
would
think
themselves
under
the
orders
not
so
much
of
the
king
as
of
that
marshal
and
in
consequence
would
not
give
him
obedience
my
intention
is
to
make
no
change
whatever
in
the
military
command
neither
with
the
army
of
the
north
nor
the
army
of
aragon
nor
the
army
of
the
south
nor
the
army
of
portugal
save
so
much
as
is
necessary
to
secure
for
the
king
reports
from
them
all
i
want
to
do
all
that
i
can
to
give
the
king
a
new
prestige
on
his
return
to
spain
but
nothing
that
may
in
any
way
disorganize
the
army
of
andalusia
or
any
of
the
other
armies
all
from
the
caen
memorandum
for
berthier
quoted
above
it
is
clear
that
we
have
in
these
few
sentences
the
key
to
all
napoleon
s
difficulties
in
conducting
the
spanish
war
he
did
not
wish
to
have
a
marshal
at
madrid
who
would
want
to
have
all
the
glory
along
with
all
the
responsibility
he
refused
to
make
one
of
his
servants
dangerously
great
soult
s
intrigues
for
kingship
at
oporto
in
were
not
forgotten
and
soult
would
have
been
the
obvious
candidate
for
supreme
command
now
that
masséna
had
been
tried
and
found
wanting
the
emperor
preferred
to
go
on
with
the
hopeless
system
that
was
already
working
by
which
he
himself
directed
operations
from
paris
basing
his
orders
on
facts
that
were
often
a
month
old
when
he
learnt
of
them
and
sending
out
those
orders
to
reach
their
destination
another
month
later
he
was
aware
of
the
evils
of
this
arrangement
but
anything
was
better
than
to
hand
over
supreme
power
over
soldiers
to
a
single
lieutenant
it
is
strange
that
he
did
not
resolve
to
descend
into
spain
himself
during
the
summer
of
for
european
politics
were
at
the
moment
so
quiet
that
he
was
actually
thinking
of
concentrating
men
at
boulogne
for
a
real
or
a
threatened
descent
on
the
british
isles
a
project
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
dream
of
since
trafalgar
the
tension
between
france
and
russia
which
was
to
increase
in
a
dangerous
fashion
during
the
autumn
was
not
so
great
in
may
or
june
as
to
make
the
idea
of
a
spanish
campaign
impossible
if
it
was
possible
to
think
of
an
invasion
of
england
at
this
moment
it
was
surely
equally
feasible
to
consider
the
advantages
of
a
descent
on
lisbon
or
cadiz
but
apparently
it
was
the
physical
distance
between
paris
and
the
further
end
of
the
peninsula
which
deterred
the
emperor
from
seizing
what
turned
out
to
be
the
last
available
opportunity
for
a
sally
beyond
the
pyrenees
as
he
himself
observed
on
another
occasion
he
would
be
at
the
end
of
the
world
in
portugal
and
a
crisis
might
arise
behind
his
back
before
he
got
any
adequate
news
of
it
this
was
different
from
campaigning
in
central
europe
when
at
vienna
or
berlin
he
was
still
in
touch
with
paris
the
only
parallel
to
an
invasion
of
portugal
would
be
an
invasion
of
russia
and
it
will
be
remembered
that
napoleon
s
apprehensions
were
absolutely
justified
by
what
occurred
in
the
autumn
of
during
his
absence
at
moscow
the
astounding
conspiracy
of
general
malet
was
within
an
ace
of
succeeding
because
it
was
possible
to
put
about
all
manner
of
false
rumours
when
the
emperor
was
lost
to
sight
on
the
steppes
a
handful
of
plotters
we
might
almost
say
a
single
plotter
malet
himself
with
no
assets
save
impudence
and
reckless
courage
seized
the
imperial
ministers
mustered
an
armed
force
and
almost
established
a
provisional
government
and
mastered
paris
this
was
only
possible
because
the
emperor
and
the
grand
army
had
got
so
far
off
that
the
touch
between
them
and
france
had
been
lost
and
absence
of
news
for
many
days
had
set
the
tongue
of
rumour
loose
under
such
circumstances
almost
anything
might
happen
for
imposing
as
was
the
colossus
of
the
french
empire
it
stood
on
no
firm
base
its
feet
were
of
clay
napoleon
hoped
to
build
a
permanent
structure
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
all
through
his
reign
its
stability
depended
on
his
own
life
and
strength
if
he
had
been
cut
off
suddenly
by
a
at
jena
or
wagram
or
by
the
knife
of
a
fanatic
such
as
staps
spain
could
have
produced
such
enthusiasts
by
the
score
chaos
would
have
supervened
in
france
when
once
the
rumour
was
set
about
that
the
emperor
was
dead
anything
became
possible
in
paris
no
one
knew
this
better
than
himself
in
his
cynical
moments
he
would
remark
to
his
confidants
that
he
was
well
aware
that
if
sudden
death
came
to
him
the
public
feeling
would
be
one
of
relief
rather
than
of
sorrow
it
was
the
constraining
force
of
his
own
indomitable
will
alone
which
kept
everything
together
and
if
he
removed
himself
to
some
very
remote
corner
of
europe
from
which
his
orders
could
not
be
transmitted
continuously
and
at
short
intervals
there
was
grave
danger
that
the
machine
might
run
down
for
dispatches
concerning
this
and
notes
as
to
the
troops
and
ships
to
be
employed
see
the
project
seems
to
have
been
seriously
thought
over
the
emperor
wrongly
believing
that
england
was
stripped
of
regular
troops

reported
by
the
latter
in
vie

for
a
similar
hint
of
danger
in
see
above
vol
pp
hence
it
may
perhaps
be
said
that
the
peninsula
was
saved
from
the
presence
of
the
emperor
in
because
of
the
necessary
limitations
of
a
power
he
dared
not
remove
himself
from
the
centre
of
affairs
he
would
not
make
one
of
his
jealous
and
ambitious
lieutenants
by
giving
him
supreme
command
this
being
so
the
bad
old
system
had
to
go
on
and
that
system
of
orders
grounded
on
information
and
followed
or
not
followed
by
execution
was
bound
to
fail
when
the
enemy
s
movements
were
guided
by
the
cool
and
resolute
brain
of
wellington
more
than
once
napoleon
wrote
in
a
petulant
mood
to
complain
that
it
was
absurd
that
all
his
spanish
armies
should
be
detained
and
kept
in
check
by
a
mere
british
troops
he
refused
for
a
long
time
to
take
the
portuguese
seriously
and
would
only
reckon
the
spanish
guerrilleros
as
brigands
or
what
he
failed
to
see
was
that
a
small
army
worked
by
a
general
on
the
spot
who
had
minute
local
knowledge
and
admirable
foresight
was
necessarily
superior
to
a
much
larger
force
directed
by
orders
from
a
distance
and
commanded
by
several
marshals
who
were
bitterly
jealous
of
each
other
moreover
he
never
thoroughly
comprehended
the
way
in
which
the
movements
of
his
armies
were
delayed
by
the
fact
that
they
were
moving
in
a
country
where
every
peasant
was
their
enemy
where
provisions
could
only
be
collected
by
armed
force
and
where
no
dispatch
would
reach
its
destination
unless
it
were
guarded
by
an
escort
of
from
to
men
and
he
refused
to
see
that
a
division
or
an
army
corps
was
in
spain
practically
no
more
than
the
garrison
of
the
province
which
it
occupied
that
if
it
moved
that
province
immediately
became
hostile
soil
again
and
would
have
to
be
reconquered
he
was
always
prescribing
the
concentration
of
large
bodies
of
men
by
means
of
the
evacuation
of
places
or
regions
of
secondary
importance
his
marshals
knowing
the
practical
inconveniences
of
such
evacuations
were
loth
to
carry
them
out
to
disgarrison
a
region
meant
that
all
communications
were
cut
off
and
that
the
nearest
posts
were
at
once
blockaded
by
guerrillero
bands
whenever
the
army
of
andalusia
concentrated
it
ceased
to
receive
its
dispatches
or
its
convoys
from
madrid
and
soon
learned
that
granada
and
seville
were
being
menaced
whenever
the
army
of
the
north
concentrated
the
road
between
vittoria
and
burgos
was
cut
and
the
descended
from
the
cantabrian
mountains
to
threaten
all
the
posts
in
old
castile
and
the
concentration
when
made
could
only
continue
for
a
few
days
for
lack
of
food
for
there
is
hardly
a
region
in
spain
where
a
very
large
army
or
men
can
live
on
the
country
for
a
week
it
was
this
and
no
mere
jealousy
of
rival
generals
which
forced
soult
and
marmont
to
part
as
we
shall
see
in
june
and
marmont
and
dorsenne
in
september
of
the
same
year
and
which
in
november
prevented
the
immense
body
formed
by
the
united
armies
of
the
south
centre
north
and
portugal
from
pursuing
wellington
to
ciudad
rodrigo
if
such
a
force
as
men
were
concentrated
it
had
to
be
fed
after
a
few
days
of
living
on
the
country
it
would
be
forced
to
ask
for
convoys
but
convoys
coming
from
long
distances
were
the
destined
prey
of
the
guerrilleros
if
not
captured
they
were
at
least
delayed
meanwhile
the
army
in
front
would
run
out
of
provisions
and
be
forced
to
scatter
itself
once
more
in
order
to
live
after
masséna
s
venture
no
french
marshal
ever
dared
to
think
of
plunging
into
portugal
where
he
knew
that
he
would
find
before
him
a
country
systematically
devastated
no
one
was
better
aware
of
this
limitation
of
the
french
power
than
wellington
he
had
written
as
early
as
that
the
enemy
could
not
turn
him
out
of
the
peninsula
with
anything
less
than
men
and
that
he
could
make
such
arrangements
that
an
army
of
that
number
could
not
live
in
the
country
the
prophecy
was
fulfilled
over
and
over
again
with
the
enormous
strength
of
the
imperial
armies
it
was
not
impossible
to
collect
or
men
but
it
was
impossible
to
feed
them
all
concentrations
must
be
but
temporary
when
the
enemy
was
massed
the
army
might
have
to
give
ground
or
only
to
accept
an
action
under
the
most
favourable
conditions
but
the
french
would
soon
have
to
scatter
and
then
wellington
regained
his
freedom
of
action
sometimes
on
absolutely
false
information
due
to
the
emperor
s
vast
distance
from
the
theatre
of
war
leading
him
to
make
hypotheses
which
had
been
falsified
because
of
the
mistaken
premises
on
which
he
grounded
them
for
example
on
march
he
told
berthier
that
masséna
s
head
quarters
were
at
coimbra
and
that
a
detachment
of
his
army
occupied
oporto
and
these
news
were
to
be
sent
on
to
soult
on
that
day
masséna
was
already
behind
the
coa
on
his
retreat
to
ciudad
rodrigo
compare
the
dispatches
of
march
where
it
is
demonstrated
that
soult
has
nothing
to
fear
for
badajoz
because
wellington
can
not
detach
more
than
men
against
it
and
that
of
december
where
it
is
demonstrated
that
soult
having
men
should
be
ashamed
of
himself
for
allowing
the
affront
of
arroyo
dos
molinos
to
be
put
upon
him
by
hill

december
it
was
useless
therefore
for
the
emperor
to
reiterate
his
orders
that
his
marshals
were
to
join
their
armies
and
livrer
enfin
une
belle
bataille
against
wellington
it
takes
two
sides
to
fight
a
battle
and
wellington
was
determined
never
to
accept
a
general
action
when
the
numbers
were
hopelessly
against
him
he
would
give
back
into
portugal
and
the
enemy
could
not
follow
him
for
more
than
a
march
or
two
napoleon
to
berthier
orders
for
bessières
and
marmont
of
may
meanwhile
though
he
could
not
undertake
to
descend
himself
into
portugal
napoleon
did
not
cease
to
pour
troops
across
the
pyrenees
it
is
often
said
that
after
masséna
s
expedition
of
he
began
to
neglect
the
peninsula
and
to
turn
all
his
thoughts
towards
the
growing
tension
with
russia
this
is
not
correct
it
ignores
the
fact
that
the
french
armies
in
spain
rose
to
their
highest
numbers
during
the
year
while
not
ceasing
to
send
their
regular
drafts
to
all
the
corps
there
engaged
the
emperor
dispatched
three
new
divisions
of
his
best
troops
to
the
front
during
the
summer
these
were
no
collections
of
fourth
battalions
or
de
but
old
units
of
high
reputation
drawn
partly
from
the
army
of
italy
partly
from
the
garrisons
of
the
coasts
of
france
one
division
under
general
souham
ultimately
went
to
join
the
army
of
portugal
the
second
under
general
caffarelli
was
absorbed
in
the
army
of
the
north
the
third
under
general
reille
was
sent
to
reinforce
the
garrison
of
navarre
and
aragon
where
suchet
wanted
fresh
troops
to
occupy
the
land
behind
him
when
he
was
pushing
forward
towards
catalonia
and
valencia
in
addition
two
fresh
regiments
of
italian
troops
were
requisitioned
from
the
viceroy
eugène
beauharnais
for
service
in
eastern

the
total
reinforcement
to
the
armies
beyond
the

amounted
to

annual
draft

the
deficit
in
the
strength
of
the
french

caused
by

was
more

made
up

of

of

we
brought
the
history
of
the
campaigns
of
suchet
and
macdonald
in
aragon
and
catalonia
as
far
as
december
the
day
on
which
the
marshal
came
down
to
the
lower
ebro
at
the
head
of
the
of
the
corps
in
order
to
cover
the
siege
of
tortosa
which
his
colleague
the
commander
of
the
army
of
aragon
was
about
to
take
in
hand
for
five
months
ever
since
august
as
it
will
be
remembered
suchet
had
been
waiting
to
commence
the
attack
on
tortosa
which
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
conduct
with
his
own
resources
since
the
besieger
would
have
not
only
to
execute
his
own
operations
but
to
fend
off
at
the
same
time
all
attempts
by
the
spanish
armies
of
catalonia
and
valencia
to
relieve
a
fortress
which
was
equally
important
to
each
of
them
for
tortosa
commanded
the
one
land
route
by
which
catalonia
and
valencia
were
still
able
to
communicate
with
each
other
no
other
bridge
on
the
ebro
was
in
spanish
hands
it
was
highly
desirable
to
keep
the
line
of
defence
in
eastern
spain
unbroken
and
tortosa
lay
at
its
narrowest
and
most
dangerous
point
the
emperor
napoleon
attached
an
immense
importance
to
its
capture
and
considered
that
after
its
fall
and
that
of
tarragona
the
conquest
of
valencia
and
the
termination
of
the
war
on
this
side
of
the
peninsula
would
be
at
hand
already
in
september
he
was
looking
forward
to
all
these
events
as
matters
of
the
near
future
but
though
tortosa
was
actually
to
be
captured
in
january
tarragona
in
june
and
valencia
in
december
the
consummation
was
never
to
come
to
pass
for
two
years
more
down
to
the
very
end
of
the
war
the
indomitable
catalans
were
destined
to
maintain
their
independence
despite
of
all
the
successes
of
the
french
arms
no
of
september
tortosa
was
not
quite
so
indispensable
in
reality
as
it
looked
on
the
map
for
though
it
would
have
been
a
point
of
absolutely
vital
importance
to
the
spaniards
if
they
had
been
compelled
to
conduct
all
their
operations
by
land
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
british
command
of
the
mediterranean
gave
an
alternative
route
for
communication
between
north
and
south
which
the
french
could
never
touch
long
after
tortosa
had
fallen
troops
were
repeatedly
and
easily
transferred
from
catalonia
to
valencia
and
vice
versa
despite
of
the
fact
that
suchet
had
completely
mastered
all
the
land
routes
indeed
it
may
be
said
that
the
sea
passage
from
one
to
the
other
was
always
preferable
to
the
route
through
tortosa
for
the
country
about
both
banks
of
the
lower
ebro
was
rugged
barren
and
thinly
peopled
and
tortosa
itself
a
decayed
city
of
inhabitants
was
the
only
place
in
this
region
which
presented
resources
of
any
kind
for
an
army
on
the
march
it
is
moreover
twenty
miles
from
the
sea
and
not
a
port
strange
to
say
there
is
no
decent
harbour
at
the
mouth
of
the
ebro
though
the
river
is
intermittently
navigable
for
a
good
many
miles
in
its
lower
course
its
estuary
has
never
been
a
point
through
which
trade
discharges
itself
to
the
sea
the
commerce
of
southern
catalonia
goes
to
tarragona
sixty
miles
to
the
north
of
the
ebro
mouth
that
of
northern
valencia
to
peniscola
thirty
miles
to
its
south
tortosa
indeed
was
more
important
to
the
french
than
to
the
spaniards
since
napoleon
s
armies
were
tied
down
to
land
routes
and
if
ever
they
were
to
make
a
lodgement
in
valencia
would
find
the
possession
of
that
city
and
its
bridge
absolutely
necessary
if
they
were
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
troops
left
in
catalonia
at
last
in
december
macdonald
had
accomplished
the
preliminary
duties
which
rendered
it
possible
for
him
to
move
on
tortosa
he
had
revictualled
barcelona
so
that
it
would
be
safe
for
some
months
from
famine
and
he
had
repaired
the
gap
in
the
french
lines
in
northern
catalonia
which
had
been
caused
by
henry
o
donnell
s
daring
expedition
to
la
bispal
in
the
preceding
september
though
the
spanish
army
had
not
been
crushed
nor
indeed
seriously
injured
it
had
been
thrust
aside
for
the
moment
macdonald
had
brought
down
three
divisions
over
men
to
mora
on
the
ebro
some
miles
to
the
north
of
tortosa
and
with
them
he
was
prepared
to
act
as
a
covering
force
to
the
projected
siege
he
was
strong
enough
to
render
any
attempt
at
relief
by
the
catalan
army
impossible
for
a
force
sufficient
to
beat
him
could
not
be
collected
by
the
enemy
unless
they
abandoned
all
their
outlying
posts
and
this
was
practically
impossible
for
local
feeling
in
the
principality
was
too
strong
to
allow
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
smaller
spanish
detachments
from
the
various
valleys
and
small
towns
which
they
covered
there
was
still
the
valencian
army
to
be
considered
but
suchet
considered
that
he
could
himself
deal
with
that
unfortunate
and
force
he
had
already
proved
its
weakness
at
the
series
of
engagements
in
august
in
which
he
had
so
effectually
scattered
the
levies
of
the
dictator
josé
caro
one
division
would
probably
suffice
to
keep
the
valencians
at
bay
while
with
two
others
the
actual
siege
of
tortosa
could
be
taken
in
hand
it
was
the
catalan
army
alone
which
had
made
suchet
anxious
and
he
was
now
to
be
relieved
of
all
care
on
that
side
by
macdonald
see
vol
iii
the
preparations
for
the
siege
it
will
be
remembered
had
long
been
in
progress
ever
since
august
magazines
and
material
had
been
accumulating
at
xerta
they
had
been
brought
down
the
ebro
from
mequinenza
whenever
the
water
was
high
enough
to
allow
of
navigation
not
without
much
difficulty
and
occasional
petty
disasters
when
the
catalan
miqueletes
made
a
pounce
upon
an
exposed
convoy
heavy
guns
were
now
lying
ready
at
xerta
with
rounds
of
ammunition
for
them
and
lb
more
of
powder
to
set
in
motion
the
besieging
army
and
this
very
large
it
only
required
that
the
covering
forces
on
each
side
of
the
ebro
should
take
up
their
positions
when
macdonald
had
brought
up
his
troops
to
mora
and
undertaken
to
move
them
to
perello
the
junction
point
of
the
two
roads
from
tortosa
to
tarragona
nothing
more
remained
to
be
settled
if
the
catalan
army
should
try
to
attack
him
it
would
certainly
be
beaten
being
far
too
weak
to
face
french
troops
concentrated
in
one
body
for
the
restraining
of
the
valencians
on
the
other
side
of
the
ebro
general
musnier
with
men
was
placed
at
uldecona
twelve
miles
beyond
tortosa
on
the
great
road
to
the
south
see
vol
iii
these
arrangements
being
made
suchet
crossed
the
ebro
at
xerta
by
his
pontoon
bridge
on
december
with
twelve
battalions
and
made
a
sweeping
circular
march
to
shut
in
tortosa
on
the
northern
side
while
five
battalions
more
under
general
abbé
moved
by
the
other
bank
to
block
the
by
which
the
city
communicates
with
valencia
and
the
south
the
operation
was
completed
without
resistance
save
at
the
col
de
alba
where
a
post
of
catalans
placed
to
cover
the
road
between
tortosa
and
the
pass
of
balaguer
was
discovered
this
small
force
was
driven
into
tortosa
after
a
skirmish
two
small
convoys
on
their
way
from
tarragona
by
sea
had
to
turn
back
because
the
way
into
the
city
was
closed
the
siege
of
tortosa
was
remarkable
for
its
swift
progress
and
complete
success
it
can
only
be
compared
with
wellington
s
capture
of
ciudad
rodrigo
just
a
year
later
in
this
respect
the
army
of
aragon
arrived
in
front
of
the
city
on
december
the
surrender
took
place
on
january
at
first
sight
the
problem
set
before
suchet
appeared
by
no
means
likely
to
receive
such
a
rapid
solution
for
tortosa
as
a
fortress
had
many
strong
points
the
city
lies
on
and
around
the
end
of
a
spur
of
the
sierra
de
alba
which
runs
down
to
the
bank
of
the
ebro
this
spur
at
its
termination
is
three
ravines
divide
it
into
four
separate
hills
of
which
the
highest
is
that
crowned
by
the
castle
the
other
three
die
down
into
undulations
and
leave
between
them
and
the
ebro
a
comparatively
flat
space
on
which
the
lower
part
of
the
town
is
built
its
higher
quarters
lie
on
the
slopes
where
the
various
hills
begin
to
rise
from
the
level
the
old
enceinte
of
tortosa
had
consisted
of
a
mediaeval
wall
running
across
the
hills
and
down
the
ravines
between
them
so
as
to
enclose
nothing
but
the
inhabited
parts
of
the
city
but
after
a
famous
siege
during
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
a
number
of
outer
works
had
been
constructed
to
crown
the
culminating
summit
of
each
hill
and
keep
future
besiegers
at
a
distance
while
part
of
the
inner
ancient
fortifications
had
been
transformed
into
a
series
of
bastions
so
far
as
the
ground
allowed
the
outer
works
were
starting
from
the
river
on
the
extreme
front
a
large
hornwork
called
las
tenazas
crowning
the
hill
which
lies
most
to
the
left
protecting
the
suburb
of
remolinos
and
commanding
the
flat
ground
as
far
as
the
river
from
which
it
is
only
yards
distant
a
second
hornwork
covered
the
outer
side
of
the
castle
hill
this
was
called
el
bonete
there
was
a
deep
ravine
on
each
side
of
it
a
sort
of
outer
enceinte
with
three
bastions
la
victoria
el
cristo
and
cruces
runs
along
the
summit
of
the
fourth
hill
which
is
broader
than
the
rest
and
expands
into
a
plateau
the
old
town
wall
formed
a
second
line
in
rear
of
this
advanced
front
the
last
hill
that
most
towards
the
was
crowned
by
a
strong
closed
fort
named
after
the
duke
of
orleans
the
general
who
had
captured
the
city
for
philip
v
in
the
year
between
the
orleans
hill
and
the
river
there
was
no
high
ground
this
was
the
only
open
front
of
the
city
which
was
approachable
on
a
level
without
any
natural
hindrances
here
the
enceinte
had
no
outer
works
it
consisted
of
two
large
bastions
san
pedro
and
san
juan
with
a
named
el
temple
projecting
between
them
this
last
was
a
low
work
of
no
great
strength
the
curtain
behind
it
which
joined
san
pedro
and
san
juan
was
a
mere
shell
with
no
terrace
or
room
for
guns
the
other
side
of
the
city
was
sufficiently
protected
by
the
broad
and
swift
river
yards
in
width
behind
it
was
only
the
ancient
wall
but
as
this
was
wholly
inaccessible
its
weakness
did
not
matter
in
the
middle
of
the
river
front
which
was
yards
long
was
a
gate
leading
to
the
great
bridge
of
boats
this
was
protected
on
the
further
bank
by
a
little
built
in
the
form
of
a
ravelin
and
well
armed
with
artillery
napier
s
tenaxas
and
belmas
s
tenailles
the
the
garrison
consisted
when
the
siege
began
of
men
including
artillery
and
a
weak
battalion
of
urban
guards
the
regiments
were
drawn
partly
from
the
catalonian
and
partly
from
the
valencian
army
there
being
seven
battalions
from
the
former
and
four
from
the
latter
the
governor
was
lilli
conde
de
alacha
an
old
officer
who
had
won
some
credit
two
years
back
by
bringing
off
his
small
corps
intact
after
the
battle
of
tudela
when
he
had
been
cut
off
by
the
french
in
the
mountains
unfortunately
it
is
impossible
to
argue
that
because
an
officer
has
made
a
skilful
retreat
he
is
a
good
lilli
indeed
proved
the
reverse
on
this
occasion
all
that
can
be
said
in
his
defence
is
that
he
was
old
and
in
bad
health
his
conduct
during
the
siege
was
vacillating
and
inexplicable
he
more
than
once
declared
that
he
would
give
over
charge
of
the
defence
to
the
second
in
command
yriarte
but
he
would
then
appear
again
and
countermand
all
yriarte
s
orders
in
the
end
he
capitulated
on
his
own
account
against
the
wishes
and
without
the
knowledge
of
the
brigadier
the
strength
of
the
garrison
raises
a
conflict
of
authorities
the
spanish
official
figures
are
those
given
above
which
are
followed
by
schepeler
and
arteche
but
suchet
says
that
he
captured
prisoners
including
the
wounded
in
the
hospitals
and
that
several
hundred
men
more
had
perished
before
the
surrender
he
gives
a
muster
roll
of
the
garrison
purporting
to
bear
out
his
figures
which
belmas
copies
since
suchet
s
spanish
totals
are
often
more
than
doubtful
cf
vol
iii
i
accept
the
figures
given
by
his
adversaries
the
december
figures
of
the
spanish
army
of
catalonia
show
men
in
all
distributed
in
garrisons
including
those
of
tarragona
tortosa
seu
de
urgel
cardona
and
smaller
places
i
think
that
for
tortosa
is
probable
see
vol
ii
the
problem
in
poliorcetics
set
before
suchet
and
his
engineers
at
tortosa
had
some
resemblance
to
that
which
was
to
confront
wellington
at
badajoz
a
few
months
later
given
a
town
to
besiege
which
is
partly
built
on
heights
crowned
by
forts
and
partly
in
the
flat
is
it
better
to
attack
one
of
the
forts
which
if
taken
commands
the
whole
town
or
to
start
against
the
lower
front
the
latter
will
be
easier
to
assail
but
after
its
fall
the
strongholds
on
the
heights
may
hold
out
as
independent
fortresses
whereas
if
a
dominating
work
on
a
hill
is
taken
in
hand
it
may
make
a
very
hard
and
long
resistance
but
if
once
it
is
captured
the
whole
city
is
overlooked
by
it
and
must
surrender
the
answer
to
the
problem
seems
to
be
that
all
depends
on
the
governor
and
the
garrison
if
he
and
they
are
weak
it
will
suffice
to
attack
the
easier
front
for
when
the
lower
town
has
fallen
the
morale
will
be
so
shaken
that
they
will
surrender
without
attempting
to
hold
the
upper
works
but
if
they
are
active
and
obstinate
it
may
be
worth
while
to
aim
at
the
most
commanding
position
which
if
captured
absolutely
compels
the
capitulation
of
the
whole
place
yet
there
remains
the
danger
that
the
crucial
fort
may
be
so
strong
that
no
effort
can
take
it
from
a
determined
defender
this
happened
to
wellington
at
the
two
earlier
sieges
of
badajoz
the
fall
of
san
cristobal
would
have
brought
about
most
inevitably
the
surrender
of
the
city
but
it
proved
too
hard
a
nut
to
crack
in
the
time
and
with
the
means
at
the
english
general
s
disposal
suchet
at
tortosa
struck
at
the
easiest
front
taking
the
risk
that
he
might
have
to
conduct
a
second
siege
of
the
upper
works
as
he
had
to
do
at
tarragona
his
next
leaguer
when
he
had
breached
the
weakest
point
but
before
a
storm
had
been
tried
the
imbecile
governor
capitulated
the
weak
front
of
tortosa
was
the
bastion
of
san
pedro
and
the
of
el
temple
on
its
flank
they
were
not
properly
supported
or
flanked
by
any
works
on
higher
ground
for
fort
orleans
on
the
nearest
hill
did
not
command
all
the
flats
in
front
of
san
pedro
and
moreover
suchet
intended
to
give
this
fort
so
much
business
on
its
own
account
that
its
gunners
would
have
little
attention
to
spare
for
the
attack
on
the
lower
ground
to
their
right
there
were
two
additional
advantages
the
soil
in
front
of
san
pedro
was
soft
river
mould
very
easy
to
dig
and
moreover
this
bastion
could
be
enfiladed
by
batteries
on
the
other
side
of
the
ebro
such
batteries
had
nothing
to
fear
if
properly
constructed
from
the
guns
of
the
little
while
on
the
river
front
of
the
city
there
were
no
cannon
at
all
they
could
not
be
mounted
on
the
mediaeval
walls
on
the
and
suchet
was
employed
in
bringing
up
his
choosing
the
emplacements
of
his
camps
and
constructing
across
the
river
both
above
and
below
the
fortress
on
the
active
operations
started
with
the
development
of
a
false
attack
on
fort
orleans
whose
attention
it
was
necessary
to
distract
the
construction
of
a
first
parallel
against
this
work
was
begun
with
some
ostentation
and
had
to
be
carried
out
under
a
furious
fire
from
its
artillery
on
the
night
of
the
the
real
business
commenced
men
crept
across
the
flat
ground
by
the
river
opposite
san
pedro
and
threw
up
an
entrenchment
within
yards
of
its
ditch
they
were
undiscovered
and
unopposed
for
the
night
was
dark
and
windy
and
the
spaniards
had
no
outposts
beyond
the
walls
and
kept
bad
watch
at
dawn
paces
of
trench
had
been
constructed
and
a
safe
access
to
the
parallel
had
been
contrived
by
connecting
one
of
its
ends
with
a
ravine
which
cuts
across
the
flat
a
little
to
the
rear
and
whose
bottom
could
not
be
searched
by
the
guns
of
the
place
the
trench
was
sloped
away
on
the
right
so
as
not
to
be
enfiladed
by
downward
fire
from
fort
orleans
which
would
have
commanded
it
supposing
it
had
been
drawn
exactly
parallel
to
the
front
of
san
pedro
this
was
a
tremendously
advantageous
start
seldom
has
a
besieger
been
able
to
begin
his
works
at
such
a
short
distance
from
his
objective
next
morning
the
new
trench
became
visible
to
the
spaniards
who
turned
all
the
artillery
of
the
neighbouring
front
upon
it
but
to
little
effect
for
the
soil
was
soft
and
the
french
had
dug
deep
a
sortie
was
made
from
the
of
el
temple
but
was
driven
off
with
loss
the
only
successful
effort
of
the
spaniards
on
this
day
was
that
the
guns
of
fort
orleans
succeeded
in
destroying
part
of
the
trenches
of
the
false
attack
in
front
of
them
and
drove
out
the
workers
this
was
of
little
consequence
as
suchet
was
not
really
aiming
at
the
fort
on
the
and
december
the
main
attack
was
urged
with
a
celerity
that
seemed
appalling
to
the
defenders
despite
of
a
heavy
fire
of
musketry
as
well
as
of
artillery
approaches
were
pushed
forward
from
the
first
parallel
to
within
yards
of
the
bastion
of
san
pedro
and
yards
of
the
temple
the
works
opposite
fort
orleans
were
repaired
and
extended
on
the
the
two
approaches
in
the
plain
were
connected
by
a
long
trench
which
formed
the
second
parallel
only
yards
from
the
walls
on
the
new
zigzags
thrown
out
from
this
line
reached
the
glacis
of
san
pedro
the
garrison
made
two
sorties
in
the
night
to
hinder
this
advance
at
all
hazards
but
failed
being
driven
off
by
the
musketry
from
the
second
parallel
without
much
difficulty
the
force
employed
men
was
too
small
meanwhile
the
artillery
and
sappers
were
constructing
ten
batteries
four
and
these
the
largest
in
the
main
frontal
attack
but
four
others
on
the
heights
over
against
fort
orleans
and
two
beyond
the
river
whose
special
purpose
was
to
enfilade
the
front
of
san
pedro
and
also
to
play
upon
the
bridge
of
boats
which
joined
the
city
to
the
the
trenches
on
the
heights
before
fort
orleans
were
also
strengthened
and
a
second
parallel
constructed
in
front
of
the
first
at
some
loss
of
life
but
it
was
necessary
to
keep
the
enemy
on
this
front
employed
or
he
would
have
interfered
too
much
with
the
real
attack
in
the
plain
all
this
had
been
accomplished
before
the
french
had
fired
a
single
gun
there
is
hardly
another
instance
to
be
quoted
of
a
siege
in
which
the
assailants
got
up
to
the
glacis
and
crowned
the
covered
way
without
any
assistance
from
their
artillery
it
seems
that
the
gunnery
of
the
defence
must
have
been
exceptionally
bad
and
the
sorties
hitherto
had
been
small
and
feeble
quite
insufficient
to
interfere
with
much
less
to
destroy
the
approaches
noting
batteries
sketched
out
on
several
points
and
approaching
completion
yriarte
saw
that
he
must
at
all
costs
try
to
delay
the
opening
of
the
adversary
s
fire
and
on
the
night
of
the
made
two
sallies
in
considerable
force
men
came
out
of
the
rastro
gate
beyond
fort
orleans
to
attack
the
upper
trenches
as
many
more
issued
from
san
pedro
against
the
main
attack
the
sortie
was
an
entire
failure
most
of
the
men
lay
down
and
began
to
skirmish
with
the
before
they
had
got
near
the
works
a
very
few
reached
them
and
were
killed
on
the
parapet
but
the
attack
in
the
plain
was
a
serious
one
and
pressed
home
the
lodgement
in
the
covered
way
was
captured
and
destroyed
and
the
spaniards
penetrated
to
the
second
parallel
and
captured
part
of
it
for
a
time
they
were
finally
driven
out
by
a
reserve
of
four
battalions
commanded
by
general
abbé
but
not
before
they
had
done
considerable
damage
the
besiegers
had
to
spend
the
following
day
and
night
december
in
repairing
the
trenches
and
parapets
and
getting
a
fresh
lodgement
in
the
covered
way
on
the
morning
of
the
latter
day
the
ten
opened
simultaneously
with
guns
and
very
soon
gained
a
marked
superiority
over
the
fire
of
the
defence
the
cannon
of
fort
orleans
and
the
bastion
of
san
juan
were
silenced
as
were
also
those
of
the
temple
and
san
pedro
the
bridge
of
boats
was
nearly
destroyed
next
night
the
spanish
fire
being
crushed
the
third
parallel
was
constructed
on
the
very
brink
of
the
ditch
of
san
pedro
and
within
yards
of
the
wall
of
the
bastion
the
mortar
batteries
were
employed
in
distributing
a
rain
of
projectiles
in
the
streets
behind
the
attacked
front
to
prevent
the
besieged
from
constructing
defences
and
barricades
on
which
they
might
fall
back
when
the
wall
was
breached
though
not
altogether
successful
for
the
spaniards
succeeded
in
building
some
traverses
and
in
blocking
and
loopholing
many
houses
the
bombardment
caused
many
casualties
and
cowed
the
population
who
evacuated
this
quarter
and
sought
refuge
in
the
interior
of
the
town
the
interior
of
fort
orleans
was
also
shelled
with
some
effect
its
garrison
retired
to
their
and
kept
very
quiet
making
little
attempt
to
repair
the
injuries
to
its
outer
wall
or
to
replace
the
injured
cannon
on
the
night
of
the
the
french
succeeded
in
getting
down
from
the
third
parallel
into
the
ditch
of
san
pedro
with
the
object
of
mining
the
scarp
and
blowing
down
sufficient
debris
to
fill
the
ditch
their
first
party
was
driven
out
again
by
the
fire
of
two
guns
which
had
been
brought
up
to
enfilade
the
ditch
from
the
extreme
flank
of
the
bastion
but
on
the
following
morning
all
the
were
turned
on
to
these
guns
and
destroyed
them
meanwhile
the
spaniards
had
abandoned
the
taking
the
men
away
by
boat
and
throwing
the
guns
into
the
water
except
three
injured
and
spiked
pieces
the
ditch
was
occupied
during
the
day
december
and
the
miners
got
to
work
so
little
incommoded
by
the
fire
of
the
defenders
who
were
hardly
visible
on
the
wall
that
they
lost
only
two
men
killed
while
establishing
themselves
in
their
dangerous
position
their
most
serious
hindrance
came
from
the
good
quality
of
the
masonry
which
they
were
attacking
it
was
mediaeval
work
and
as
hard
as
iron
the
decisive
stroke
at
this
point
however
was
to
be
given
by
the
artillery
and
on
the
night
of
the
a
battery
for
four
was
commenced
in
the
third
parallel
only
yards
away
from
the
ramparts
of
san
pedro
it
had
not
yet
opened
when
at
ten
o
clock
on
the
morning
of
january
the
governor
hoisted
the
white
flag
and
sent
a
colonel
veyan
into
suchet
s
camp
to
treat
for
surrender
the
proposals
however
were
quite
inadmissible
as
alacha
only
covenanted
to
evacuate
tortosa
if
it
were
not
relieved
in
fifteen
days
and
demanded
that
the
garrison
should
not
be
prisoners
of
war
but
should
be
allowed
to
march
to
tarragona
with
arms
and
baggage
suchet
refused
to
treat
as
was
natural
but
was
delighted
with
the
aspect
of
affairs
a
garrison
which
begins
to
parley
before
there
is
a
practicable
breach
in
its
walls
is
obviously
demoralized
and
needs
only
a
little
further
persuasion
by
the
strong
arm
he
sent
back
with
the
spanish
his
own
chief
of
the
staff
colonel
saint
with
orders
to
impress
on
the
governor
the
futility
of
further
demands
such
as
those
he
had
just
made
he
announced
that
he
should
storm
the
place
next
morning
unless
one
of
the
upper
forts
were
placed
in
his
hands
as
a
pledge
of
complete
submission
the
governor
therefore
called
and
consulted
a
council
of
war
some
of
the
officers
and
notables
assembled
voted
that
an
attempt
must
be
made
to
defend
the
breach
others
that
the
garrison
should
retire
into
the
castle
and
forts
and
abandon
the
town
as
untenable
but
there
were
some
despairing
voices
raised
the
representatives
of
the
municipality
spoke
with
terror
of
the
bombardment
of
the
last
few
days
some
of
the
officers
complained
that
their
troops
were
completely
demoralized
and
were
leaving
their
posts
to
hide
in
the
town
suchet
s
proposals
nevertheless
were
rejected
only
a
little
more
persuasion
however
was
required
to
break
down
alacha
s
nerve
on
the
morning
of
the
of
january
the
battery
opposite
san
pedro
opened
with
the
best
effect
by
the
afternoon
there
was
a
breach
yards
broad
and
the
miners
reported
that
they
had
got
deep
enough
into
the
lower
walls
to
make
an
explosion
profitable
the
curtain
at
the
back
of
the
temple
had
also
been
much
battered
and
was
crumbling
but
an
assault
here
was
not
practicable
as
the
intervening
work
was
still
in
the
hands
of
the
spaniards
for
a
second
time
the
governor
hoisted
the
white
flag
but
suchet
ordered
the
fire
to
continue
at
the
breach
and
began
to
collect
his
storming
columns
in
the
shelter
of
the
parallels
while
his
mortar
batteries
played
on
the
town
at
large
he
was
afraid
that
the
enemy
was
scheming
for
a
suspension
of
arms
during
which
they
would
clandestinely
repair
and
retrench
the
broken
wall
the
answer
that
he
sent
back
when
a
second
came
out
to
him
was
that
he
must
have
a
simple
and
complete
capitulation
and
that
one
of
the
upper
forts
must
be
placed
in
his
hands
before
he
would
allow
the
bombardment
to
cease
illustration
tortosa
alacha
continued
to
keep
the
white
flag
flying
on
the
citadel
and
to
exchange
messages
with
suchet
while
the
fire
was
still
going
on
at
the
breach
of
san
pedro
where
yriarte
was
doing
his
best
to
keep
his
men
together
though
he
had
his
doubts
as
to
the
result
of
the
threatened
assault
meanwhile
the
french
general
took
an
extraordinary
resolution
gathering
from
the
confused
and
wavering
replies
of
the
governor
that
the
old
man
was
at
his
wit
s
end
and
ready
to
yield
to
pressure
he
came
to
the
castle
gate
himself
with
his
staff
and
a
company
of
grenadiers
and
sent
for
the
officer
on
guard
who
did
not
order
his
men
to
fire
because
the
white
flag
was
flying
and
messengers
continually
passing
to
and
fro
suchet
told
the
astonished
subaltern
that
hostilities
were
at
an
end
and
that
he
must
see
the
governor
without
delay
when
alacha
came
down
to
him
he
assumed
a
peremptory
tone
said
that
further
resistance
was
criminal
that
the
assault
was
about
to
take
place
at
once
and
that
the
garrison
would
be
put
to
the
sword
if
resistance
continued
he
bade
the
governor
ratify
on
the
spot
the
terms
of
capitulation
which
had
been
sent
in
upon
the
previous
afternoon
utterly
cowed
the
old
man
obeyed
at
once
called
for
a
pen
and
signed
the
document
upon
the
carriage
of
a
gun
the
company
of
grenadiers
which
had
accompanied
suchet
occupied
the
castle
and
orders
were
sent
down
to
the
city
to
cease
all
resistance
the
first
notice
that
yriarte
got
of
what
had
happened
was
by
hearing
french
drums
beating
in
the
streets
behind
him
as
a
column
descended
from
the
citadel
to
force
the
defenders
of
the
breach
to
lay
down
their
arms
when
they
had
withdrawn
the
storming
column
ran
into
the
gap
and
sacked
the
quarter
adjoining
despite
of
the
cries
and
remonstrances
of
their
officers
they
would
not
be
cheated
out
of
what
they
considered
their
lawful
prey
this
narrative
of
the
fall
of
tortosa
is
mainly
derived
from
the
sources
given
by
arteche
especially
yriarte
s
narrative
and
from
schepeler
and
vacani
these
in
some
details
differ
from
suchet
s
story
repeated
by
belmas
though
there
is
no
fundamental
discrepancy
but
it
is
clear
that
alacha
was
even
more
to
blame
than
the
french
versions
would
give
us
to
understand
vacani
iv
in
this
disgraceful
way
fell
tortosa
after
only
eighteen
days
of
siege
twelve
of
open
trenches
and
four
of
bombardment
the
french
lost
no
more
than
men
nearly
half
of
them
among
the
sappers
and
artillerymen
for
the
infantry
only
suffered
in
repelling
the
sorties
the
spaniards
had
about
killed
and
wounded
but
as
the
garrison
marched
out
only
strong
and
had
started
with
it
is
clear
that
there
had
been
other
wastage
during
the
last
days
of
the
siege
the
urban
guard
disappeared
and
the
commanders
of
the
regular
troops
were
complaining
bitterly
of
desertion
among
their
men
indeed
from
the
governor
downwards
there
seems
to
have
been
too
much
demoralization
in
all
ranks
the
second
in
command
yriarte
and
many
other
officers
did
their
duty
but
the
defence
was
not
what
might
have
been
expected
from
catalans
with
the
example
of
gerona
before
their
eyes
from
the
start
suchet
had
the
mastery
and
largely
owing
to
the
mismanagement
of
his
adversaries
if
for
example
they
had
kept
proper
watch
he
would
never
have
been
able
to
start
his
first
parallel
at
the
distance
of
only
yards
from
the
walls
this
piece
of
luck
saved
him
many
days
of
work
but
if
the
defence
was
unskilful
and
anything
rather
than
resolute
the
main
responsibility
falls
on
the
governor
whose
conduct
was
calculated
to
discourage
even
the
most
zealous
subordinates
for
he
sometimes
pleaded
his
age
and
infirmity
and
declared
that
he
handed
over
all
responsibility
to
the
second
in
command
shutting
himself
up
in
the
castle
for
whole
days
at
a
time
but
on
other
occasions
he
interfered
in
details
countermanded
orders
and
practically
resumed
charge
of
the
defence
but
to
call
a
council
of
war
to
receive
its
opinion
in
favour
of
protracted
defence
and
then
to
capitulate
behind
its
back
was
worst
of
all
such
conduct
was
absolutely
ignominious
and
it
was
not
without
reason
that
the
catalan
junta
ordered
him
to
be
tried
in
his
absence
for
cowardice
and
treason
he
was
condemned
to
death
and
the
sentence
grotesquely
enough
carried
out
upon
his
effigy
while
he
was
safe
in
france
a
prisoner
on
parole
the
figures
of
killed
and
wounded
given
by
belmas
seem
very
low
but
are
borne
out
by
the
invaluable
lists
in
martinien
who
shows
that
only
some
thirty
officers
were
killed
or
wounded
at
tortosa
of
whom
twelve
belonged
to
the
engineers
artillery
and
sappers
thirty
officers
hit
imply
at
the
usual
rate
of
one
to
twenty
men
casualties
but
it
is
very
possible
that
there
were
no
more
than
and
odd
for
the
engineer
officers
of
whom
six
were
killed
or
hurt
ran
special
risks
that
nothing
was
done
from
outside
to
save
tortosa
was
mainly
due
to
the
rapidity
of
suchet
s
operations
the
junta
of
catalonia
was
busily
engaged
in
concerting
measures
for
concentrating
a
relieving
army
had
sent
to
cadiz
for
arms
and
if
possible
reinforcements
and
had
opened
negotiations
with
the
valencians
and
with
the
irregular
forces
of
carbajal
and
villa
campa
in
the
aragonese
mountains
but
who
could
calculate
that
the
defence
would
last
only
eighteen
days
before
any
general
scheme
had
been
worked
out
the
place
had
fallen
the
only
organized
force
in
the
neighbourhood
was
the
section
of
the
catalan
army
which
lay
in
and
about
tarragona
the
responsibility
here
lay
no
longer
with
the
active
henry
o
donnell
who
had
thrown
up
the
command
in
december
and
sailed
to
the
balearic
islands
to
give
his
gangrened
wounds
time
to
heal
general
yranzo
as
the
senior
officer
in
the
principality
ought
to
have
taken
over
the
charge
of
operations
but
he
called
a
council
of
war
at
tarragona
and
declared
himself
unwilling
to
assume
the
position
that
had
fallen
to
him
he
was
unpopular
and
the
catalans
were
holding
violent
meetings
in
favour
of
the
marquis
of
campoverde
who
enjoyed
much
local
popularity
at
the
moment
this
ambitious
officer
finally
obtained
the
interim
command
owing
to
the
abnegation
of
his
seniors
but
tortosa
had
fallen
before
he
was
seated
in
the
saddle
for
he
was
finally
recognized
as
chief
only
upon
january
four
days
after
the
capitulation
for
all
this
see
wimpffen
s

in
the
appendix
to
suchet
s
i
but
even
a
capable
officer
enjoying
undisputed
control
over
all
the
catalan
forces
could
have
done
little
during
the
few
days
that
the
siege
of
tortosa
lasted
the
covering
army
under
macdonald
was
too
strong
to
be
meddled
with
by
the
two
divisions
based
on
tarragona
on
the
first
day
of
the
siege
as

have
already
seen
he
marched
from
mora
with
his
men
on
the
he
came
up
to
perello
where
meet
the
two
roads
from
tortosa
to
the
north
thus
absolutely
barring
any
attempt
to
approach
the
place
after
some
days
he
found
it
impossible
to
feed
his
troops
in
this
rugged
spot
and
divided
them
placing
one
division
of
men
under
frère
on
the
road
in
the
direct
rear
of
the
besieging
army
while
with
the
other
two
he
retired
to
ginestar
on
the
ebro
twenty
miles
due
north
of
tortosa
from
whence
he
could
reinforce
suchet
in
a
single
march
if
the
spaniards
made
any
movement
but
no
one
came
against
him
the
existence
of
his
army
in
this
quarter
sufficed
to
paralyse
the
modest
force
then
lying
in
the
neighbourhood
of
tarragona
campoverde
took
one
division
to
the
fort
of
balaguer
covering
the
coast
road
from
which
he
observed
frère
at
a
distance
while
yranzo
with
the
other
occupied
macdonald
s
old
head
quarters
at
momblanch
but
they
knew
that
they
were
too
weak
to
risk
an
advance
from
these
points
and
while
they
remained
quiet
tortosa
fell
the
only
diversions
carried
out
during
the
siege
were
in
corners
of
catalonia
where
even
a
considerable
success
would
have
had
no
effect
on
the
course
of
affairs
on
the
lower
ebro
a
french
foraging
party
of
cavalry
was
cut
up
at
tarrega
near
lerida
on
january
by
a
detachment
from
momblanch
on
december
a
landing
party
from
the
british
frigates
on
the
catalan
station
surprised
the
post
of
palamos
and
destroyed
there
two
gunboats
and
eight
transports
which
were
coasting
down
from
cette
towards
barcelona
but
remaining
on
shore
too
long
they
were
surprised
by
a
french
flying
column
and
driven
back
to
their
boats
with
a
loss
of
over
men
including
captain
fane
of
the
the
officer
in
command
on
the
news
of
the
fall
of
tortosa
the
spanish
divisions
drew
back
towards
tarragona
suchet
left
general
habert
in
charge
of
the
captured
city
dispersed
musnier
s
troops
to
morella
alcañiz
and
mequinenza
and
left
the
neapolitan
brigade
lent
him
by
macdonald
at
mora
harispe
s
division
escorted
the
spanish
prisoners
to
saragossa
and
was
accompanied
by
suchet
himself
who
had
much
to
settle
in
aragon
before
he
took
in
hand
the
siege
of
tarragona
the
next
task
imposed
upon
him
by
the
emperor
who
had
informed
him
that
he
would
find
his
marshal
s
bâton
within
its
walls
before
leaving
the
neighbourhood
of
tortosa
suchet
ordered
four
battalions
of
habert
s
division
to
execute
a
de
upon
the
little
fort
of
san
felipe
de
balaguer
on
the
coast
defile
of
the
col
de
balaguer
so
often
mentioned
of
late
it
was
completely
successful
after
a
short
bombardment
part
of
the
garrison
escaped
along
the
tarragona
road
the
governor
with
ninety
men
surrendered
january
the
fort
was
a
trifling
work
but
its
strategic
position
was
eminently
important
as
it
blocks
the
only
road
along
the
sea
from
tarragona
to
the
regions
of
the
ebro
mouth
macdonald
being
no
longer
needed
in
the
direction
of
tortosa
resolved
to
return
to
lerida
at
the
same
time
that
suchet
went
off
to
saragossa
they
were
to
meet
again
in
the
spring
for
the
great
enterprise
against
tarragona
for
reasons
not
easy
to
fathom
the
marshal
made
his
march
to
his
base
not
by
the
direct
road
but
past
tarragona
via
reus
and
valls
probably
he
was
desirous
of
clearing
the
of
the
outlying
spanish
troops
as
a
preliminary
to
the
siege
and
perhaps
he
had
some
idea
of
destroying
any
magazines
that
might
lie
in
this
direction
that
he
could
have
no
serious
intention
of
blockading
tarragona
was
shown
by
the
fact
that
he
had
sent
back
all
his
cavalry
save
one
regiment
and
most
of
his
guns
to
lerida
since
he
had
also
lent
his
neapolitan
brigade
to
suchet
his
column
was
not
much
over
strong
macdonald
was
usually
unlucky
in
his
catalonian
campaigning
though
he
had
won
great
reputation
in
mountain
warfare
against
the
austrians
in
his
early
days
he
does
not
seem
to
have
been
able
to
apply
his
knowledge
of
it
to
spain
marching
from
ginestar
by
falset
he
reached
and
occupied
the
large
town
of
reus
only
ten
miles
from
tarragona
on
january
from
thence
he
set
his
army
in
motion
for
valls
on
the
marching
across
the
front
of
the
fortress
with
which
he
clearly
had
no
intention
of
interfering
his
vanguard
was
formed
by
the
italian
division
which
was
followed
at
a
distance
of
three
miles
by
his
three
french
brigades
and
his
single
regiment
of
cavalry
meanwhile
campoverde
now
in
command
at
tarragona
had
detached
general
sarsfield
with
a
division
of
foot
and
horse
all
that
the
army
of
catalonia
possessed
to
observe
the
march
of
the
french
while
he
himself
remained
just
outside
tarragona
with
the
remainder
of
his
troops
some
men
sarsfield
had
taken
post
at
pla
some
five
miles
north
of
valls
which
town
he
had
evacuated
on
the
approach
of
the
enemy
when
macdonald
s
leading
brigade
reached
valls
information
was
received
that
there
was
a
spanish
force
close
in
its
front
without
waiting
for
orders
from
the
marshal
who
had
merely
directed
that
valls
should
be
occupied
the
commander
of
the
vanguard
general
eugenio
resolved
to
bring
the
enemy
to
action
marching
with
five
italian
battalions
and
only
thirty
chasseurs
about
men
in
all
he
ran
headlong
into
sarsfield
s
forces
drawn
up
in
a
position
the
infantry
occupying
a
ridge
the
cavalry
hidden
in
a
wood
to
the
left
unable
to
estimate
the
enemy
s
strength
and
thinking
that
a
brisk
attack
might
drive
them
off
the
ground
eugenio
a
man
of
reckless
courage
made
a
direct
frontal
charge
against
the
enemy
s
position
in
column
of
battalions
he
was
completely
beaten
his
brigade
fell
back
still
fighting
and
he
was
himself
mortally
wounded
the
recoiling
mass
was
saved
from
annihilation
by
the
arrival
on
the
field
of
the
other
italian
brigade
that
of
palombini
on
which
it
rallied
but
sarsfield
s
troops
were
determined
to
finish
appropriately
the
day
that
they
had
begun
so
well
they
fell
on
the
newly
formed
line
and
broke
it
the
cavalry
turning
palombini
s
right
and
sweeping
it
away
the
whole
italian
division
would
have
been
annihilated
but
for
the
arrival
of
two
squadrons
of
the
dragoons
under
colonel
delort
who
charged
the
victorious
cavalry
and
though
hopelessly
outnumbered
gave
the
spaniards
so
much
trouble
that
the
routed
infantry
of
eugenio
and
palombini
escaped
into
valls
without
much
further
loss
macdonald
had
refrained
from
bringing
up
the
french
brigades
to
help
his
vanguard
because
he
had
discovered
a
column
under
campoverde
coming
out
of
tarragona
to
threaten
his
rear
this
demonstration
kept
him
occupied
while
the
italians
were
being
cut
up
by
sarsfield
whose
operations
were
extremely
well
managed
and
resolute
the
italian
division
and
the
dragoons
lost
men
including
a
few
prisoners
the
spaniards
only
his
name
was
really
orsatelli
but
he
always
appears
in
the
reports
as
eugenio
vacani
says
only
including
officers
killed
and
wounded
but
martinien
s
lists
show
officers
killed
and
wounded
it
is
impossible
that
officers
should
be
hit
and
only
men
the
proportion
of
to
is
incredible
and
the
loss
must
have
been
more
like
schepeler
and
the
spaniards
put
it
at
which
is
too
high
next
day
january
macdonald
was
in
order
of
battle
at
valls
with
two
fronts
one
facing
towards
sarsfield
and
the
north
the
other
towards
campoverde
and
tarragona
but
the
spaniards
wisely
refused
to
commit
themselves
to
a
general
engagement
and
macdonald
would
not
divide
his
army
by
marching
to
assail
one
or
the
other
of
the
two
hostile
columns
in
the
night
he
retreated
to
momblanch
by
a
forced
march
leaving
the
enemy
encouraged
by
the
results
of
the
combat
of
the
and
no
less
by
the
fact
that
the
marshal
had
not
tried
to
avenge
his
check
by
an
attack
on
the
following
day
the
french
retired
to
lerida
unmolested
and
the
duke
of
tarentum
began
to
make
preparations
for
his
approaching
return
to
tarragona
in
company
with
suchet
s
corps
as
had
been
ordered
by
the
emperor
it
is
difficult
to
see
that
macdonald
gained
anything
by
his
curious
flank
march
and
he
certainly
lost
heavily
in
prestige
campoverde
exultant
at
the
good
fortune
of
his
first
venture
in
arms
recovered
from
the
despondency
caused
by
the
fall
of
tortosa
and
dreamed
of
making
a
great
blow
against
the
french
by
no
less
an
achievement
than
the
recapture
of
barcelona
ever
since
the
commencement
of
the
war
plots
and
conspiracies
had
been
rife
in
that
great
city
it
will
be
remembered
that
duhesme
had
been
forced
to
punish
the
most
important
of
them
by
a
series
of
executions
discontent
was
as
keen
as
ever
and
a
knot
of
patriots
had
formed
a
scheme
for
opening
to
their
friends
without
the
gates
of
the
fortress
of
monjuich
which
dominates
the
whole
place
this
was
to
be
done
by
the
assistance
of
a
repentant
juramentado
a
spanish
commissary
in
the
french
service
named
alcina
who
had
access
to
the
stronghold
and
imagined
that
he
had
corrupted
the
a
certain
captain
sunier
who
for
a
great
sum
of
money
undertook
to
leave
one
of
its
posterns
open
on
the
night
of
march
campoverde
who
loved
plots
and
intrigues
arranged
to
have
his
men
ready
outside
the
ditch
on
the
appointed
night
unfortunately
the
officer
who
was
supposed
to
be
a
traitor
was
only
feigning
discontent
and
treason
and
kept
informing
maurice
mathieu
the
governor
of
barcelona
of
all
the
details
of
the
plot
it
was
allowed
to
proceed
in
order
that
a
sharp
blow
might
be
inflicted
on
the
spaniards
before
the
appointed
night
campoverde
suddenly
marched
the
divisions
of
sarsfield
and
courten
to
the
immediate
vicinity
of
barcelona
and
sent
forward
from
them
a
body
of
grenadiers
who
were
to
execute
the
actual
de
they
were
allowed
to
descend
into
the
ditch
of
monjuich
and
to
approach
the
postern
when
the
whole
of
the
ramparts
were
lighted
up
with
cressets
and
and
a
furious
fire
was
opened
upon
them
the
head
of
the
column
was
blown
to
pieces
a
hundred
men
were
killed
and
wounded
at
the
first
volley
and
four
officers
and
many
of
the
rank
and
file
taken
prisoners
before
the
remainder
could
scramble
off
in
the
darkness
the
supports
hurriedly
retired
and
the
business
was
over
save
that
maurice
mathieu
caused
the
commissary
alcina
to
be
shot
in
public
next
morning
as
a
warning
to
traitors
such
plots
seldom
succeed
but
that
they
must
not
be
too
much
disregarded
as
a
source
of
danger
was
shown
only
a
few
weeks
later
when
figueras
the
second
fortress
of
catalonia
was
successfully
surprised
by
the
spaniards
as
the
result
of
a
conspiracy
exactly
similar
to
that
which
failed
at
barcelona

the
unfortunate
affair
at
monjuich
was
not
the
only
sign
of
the
revived
activity
of
the
catalans
under
the
leadership
of
campoverde
a
busy
and
active
man
but
as
subsequent
events
showed
one
lacking
both
resolution
and
true
strategic
instinct
he
was
one
of
those
who
take
many
schemes
in
hand
but
fail
for
want
of
determination
at
the
critical
moment
and
was
a
very
poor
substitute
for
that
hard
fighter
henry
o
donnell
whose
place
he
had
been
so
eager
to
seize
on
march
he
made
a
vain
attack
to
recover
the
fort
of
san
felipe
de
balaguer
marching
with
courten
s
division
of
men
he
beat
the
french
out
of
perello
where
it
was
covering
tortosa
and
laid
siege
to
the
fort
but
general
habert
came
up
with
a
force
from
the
garrison
to
reinforce
the
and
the
attack
had
to
be
given
up
almost
as
soon
as
it
was
begun
more
fruitful
were
some
attacks
of
the
of
northern
catalonia
on
convoys
passing
between
gerona
and
hostalrich
and
sarsfield
pushing
forward
to
cervera
usefully
restrained
the
foraging
of
macdonald
s
cavalry
in
the
region
east
of
lerida
but
all
this
came
to
little
and
campoverde
s
efforts
seemed
to
have
no
very
visible
results
and
certainly
did
nothing
decisive
to
prevent
suchet
and
macdonald
from
completing
their
preparations
for
the
siege
of
tarragona
it
was
much
the
same
in
aragon
where
villacampa
and
carbajal
were
contending
in
the
mountains
of
the
south
with
the
garrisons
which
held
daroca
alcañiz
teruel
and
the
other
chief
towns
of
this
rugged
and
thinly
peopled
district
the
fall
of
tortosa
had
set
free
for
the
moment
many
troops
of
the
corps
and
suchet
employed
them
in
scouring
the
country
between
these
posts
and
endeavouring
to
clear
away
the
from
their
chief
flying
columns
under
generals
paris
and
abbé
marched
up
and
down

sierras
in

vile
weather
of
february
expelled
the
insurrectionary
junta
of
aragon
from
cuenca
which
was
at
that
time
its
head
quarters
and
chased
carbajal
to
moya
where
the
frontiers
of
castile
aragon
and
valencia
meet
the
empecinado
came
over
the
mountains
from
his
usual
beat
in
the
guadalajara
country
to
help
the
aragonese
but
had
small
success
yet
the
net
result
of
all
this
hunting
was
little
this
expedition
says
suchet
himself
which
took
two
brigades
over
the
border
into
castile
for
twelve
days
procured
us
a
few
hundred
prisoners
a
more
useful
thing
was
the
destruction
of
some
small
manufactures
of
arms
but
we
were
to
see
ten
times
nay
a
hundred
times
more
these
partisans
appearing
once
again
in
the
plains
they
always
surrounded
us
were
always
dispersed
rather
than
defeated
and
never
grew
discouraged

were
required
for

no

than
for

with

the

in

stronger

any
idea
of

of

was
useless
now
that
it
was
known
that
masséna
had
departed
from
his
old

the

had
ordered
soult
to
undertake

no

it
had
moved
away

it
remained
to
be
seen
whether

would
be
able
to
carry
out
the
orders
given
him
for
no
one
in
the
french
camp
could
tell
whether
the
british
relieving
force
for
badajoz
whose
existence
had
been
known
since
march
had
actually
started
for
estremadura
or
had
joined
in
the
pursuit
of
masséna
when
it
received
the
news
that
imaz
had
made
his
disgraceful
capitulation
if
this
force
were
on
its
way
and
proved
to
be
strong
in
numbers
mortier
would
be
thrown
at
once
on
the
defensive
his
duty
would
be
to
hold
off
the
allies
till
badajoz
was
in
a
state
of
defence
and
the
repairing
of
the
fortress
would
take
some
time
even
though
the
greater
part
of
its
fortifications
were
intact
and
only
the
pardaleras
fort
and
the
ruined
bastions
behind
it
required
reconstruction
if
the
allies
came
on
in
great
force
and
without
delaying
for
a
moment
it
was
even
possible
that
mortier
would
have
to
blow
up
badajoz
and
withdraw
its
garrison
for
it
would
be
absurd
to
leave
behind
in
an
untenable
post
such
a
large
body
of
men
as
would
be
required
for
the
holding
of
its
extensive
enceinte
the
actual
course
of
affairs
in
estremadura
followed
logically
from
wellington
s
orders
to
beresford
on
the
and
the
of
march
on
the
as
it
will
be
remembered
beresford
had
been
directed
to
march
to
the
relief
of
badajoz
with
the
and
divisions
and
hamilton
s
portuguese
some
men
on
the
these
orders
had
been
countermanded
on
a
false
report
that
masséna
had
concentrated
and
was
offering
battle
behind
thomar
the
division
and
one
brigade
hoghton
s
of
the
were
called
off
and
marched
to
join
wellington
s
main
body
the
rest
of
the
division
and
hamilton
s
portuguese
stood
halted
in
or
near
abrantes
till
the
intentions
of
the
french
should
be
discovered
it
was
not
till
march
that
wellington
reassured
as
to
his
adversaries
intentions
thought
it
possible
once
more
to
take
the
relief
of
badajoz
in
hand
the
troops
about
abrantes
were
ordered
to
prepare
to
march
for
the
guadiana
in
successive
brigades
the
absent
brigade
of
the
division
which
had
reached
thomar
was
directed
to
retrace
its
steps
and
join
the
main
body
of
that
unit
but
the
division
had
gone
on
much
further
it
was
well
on
its
way
towards
coimbra
and
was
engaged
in
the
operations
it
was
not
till
the
that
wellington
thought
himself
able
to
dispatch
it
along
with
de
grey
s
brigade
of
dragoons
to
cross
the
tagus
in
the
wake
of
the
division
beresford
himself
who
had
joined
the
main
army
for
a
few
days
by
wellington
s
own
orders
was
not
given
his
final
instructions
and
sent
off
to
the
south
till
the
following
morning
nothing
could
be
done
in
estremadura
without
the
division
and
d
urban
s
diary
shows
that
the
orders
for
the
division
to
march
into
the
alemtejo
were
only
given
on
the
beresford
s
chief
of
the
staff
notes
on
that
day
orders
to
general
stewart
commanding

to
fix
his

at
tramagal
to
move

crato
or
carragueira
both
in
the

south
from

and
to
let
the
troops
remain
as
at

unless
it
should
become
necessary
to
concentrate

the
protection
of

of
this
shows
that
wellington
s
statement
to
lord
liverpool
on

vii
that
troops
had
marched
from
thomar
on
the
and
that
part
of
sir
william

had
not

and
that
their
head
had
arrived
within
three
marches
of
elvas
can
apply
at
most
to
hamilton
s
portuguese
but
before
the
moment
at
which
beresford
started
the
whole
face
of
affairs
had
been
changed
by
the
news
received
on
the
that
badajoz
had
surrendered
on
the
wellington
was
not
prepared
for
this
blow
i
had
received
on
the
he
wrote
to
lord
liverpool
accounts
of
a
most
favourable
nature
from
which
i
was
induced
to
believe
not
only
that
the
place
was
in
no
danger
but
that
it
was
in
fact
untouched
that
its
fire
was
superior
to
that
of
the
enemy
that
it
was
in
no
want
of
provisions
and
ammunition
had
sustained
no
loss
excepting
that
of
the
governor
menacho
and
was
able
and
likely
to
hold
out
for
a
month
general
imaz
a
person
of
equally
good
reputation
had
succeeded
to
the
command
and
great
confidence
was
reposed
in
him
i
had
called
up
to
the
army
the
division
of
infantry
and
the
brigade
of
heavy
cavalry
under
the
conviction
that
badajoz
would
hold
out
for
the
time
during
which
it
would
be
necessary
to
employ
them
experience
has
shown
that
i
could
not
have
done
without
these
troops
and
it
is
also
clear
that
if
i
had
left
them
behind
they
could
not
have
saved
badajoz
which
the
governor
surrendered
on
the
day
after
he
received
my
assurances
that
he
should
be
relieved
and
my
entreaties
that
he
would
hold
out
to
the
last
moment
wellington
to
lord
liverpool
march
vii
as
far
as
the
argument
from
time
goes
it
is
clear
that
wellington
is
stating
indisputable
facts
supposing
that
he
had
not
countermanded
on
the
of
march
the
orders
to
beresford
which
he
had
given
on
the
previous
night
and
that
the
three
divisions
designated
for
service
in
estremadura
had
marched
with
unrelaxing
vigour
the
head
of
their
column
could
not
have
been
further
forward
than
arronches
if
they
took
the
portalegre
road
or
estremos
if
they
took
the
elvas
road
at
the
moment
when
imaz
surrendered
as
the
former
of
these
points
is
about
and
the
latter
about
thirty
miles
from
badajoz
the
capitulation
would
not
have
been
prevented
for
the
governor
was
determined
to
surrender
and
did
so
in
full
knowledge
of
the
fact
transmitted
by
semaphore
from
elvas
that
a
relieving
expedition
was
in
hand
whether
the
nearest
allied
troops
were
as
was
actually
the
case
at
abrantes
or
as
might
have
been
the
case
at
estremos
would
not
have
affected
him
for
as
the
proceedings
recorded
at
his
council
of
war
show
he
concealed
from
his
officers
the
news
that
succour
was
promised
and
allowed
one
of
them
to
put
down
in
the
of
the
proceedings
the
statement
that
there
was
no
official
news
whatever
that
any
army
of
succour
was
in
such
official
news
imaz
possessed
through
the
semaphore
messages
sent
on
by
general
leite
at
elvas
so
that
it
is
evident
that
he
kept
them
from
the
knowledge
of
his
subordinates
see
above
if
badajoz
had
held
out
for
a
fortnight
after
march
and
wellington
supposed
that
it
was
well
able
to
defend
itself
for
a
whole
month
the
relieving
column
would
have
been
in
good
time
the
dispatch
of
march
set
in
motion
two
divisions
from
near
abrantes
that
of
the
sent
on
the
third
from
the
banks
of
the
ceira
steady
marches
of
twenty
miles
a
day
or
a
little
less
would
have
brought
stewart
and
hamilton
to
the
neighbourhood
of
badajoz
on
the
and
cole
with
the
division
and
the
dragoon
brigade
on
the
if
as
is
probable
beresford
had
waited
for
the
arrival
of
the
force
before
presenting
himself
in
front
of
the
french
lines
the
of
march
would
have
been
the
critical
day
it
is
hard
to
believe
that
soult
could
have
fought
to
advantage
since
he
must
have
left
so
many
men
to
blockade
badajoz
that
he
could
not
have
faced
beresford
with
more
than
sabres
and
bayonets
numbers
inadequate
to
hold
off
the
who
formed
the
allied
army
of
estremadura
it
is
quite
probable
that
he
might
have
raised
the
siege
and
offered
battle
with
his
whole
army
somewhere
south
of
badajoz
but
into
these
possibilities
it
is
profitless
to
inquire
cole
actually
reached
portalegre
on
the
so
could
have
been
in
front
of
badajoz
on
the
since
however
wellington
and
beresford
knew
on
the
night
of
the
that
imaz
had
surrendered
there
was
no
longer
the
same
need
for
haste
that
existed
down
to
this
moment
and
the
advance
of
the
army
was
made
at
a
moderate
pace
hamilton
s
portuguese
were
at
portalegre
by
the
the
division
came
in
on
the
and
beresford
himself
appeared
on
the
latter
day
having
ridden
through
from
the
neighbourhood
of
coimbra
in
four
days
the
division
which
had
made
an
admirable
march
a
hundred
and
ten
miles
of
mountain
road
in
six
days
came
up
on
the
on
this
day
therefore
the
whole
men
of
the
expeditionary
force
were
collected
within
forty
miles
of
badajoz
and
beresford
had
to
make
up
his
mind
as
to
the
course
of
his
campaign
the
orders
given
to
him
by
wellington
had
been
to
concentrate
at
portalegre
and
attack
the
french
who
as
it
had
now
been
ascertained
were
moving
out
to
besiege
the
little
portuguese
fortress
of
campo
mayor
just
across
the
frontier
the
small
spanish
force
under
castaños
at
estremos
the
wrecks
of
the
old
army
of
estremadura
was
to
be
called
up
to
assist
wellington
who
did
not
know
of
soult
s
departure
for
seville
thought
that
he
could
not
possibly
collect
enough
men
after
garrisoning
badajoz
and
olivenza
to
enable
him
to
face
beresford
in
a
supplementary
dispatch
he
told
his
colleague
that
he
thought
it
most
likely
that
the
marshal
would
go
south
of
the
guadiana
without
accepting
battle
in
that
case
the
allied
army
must
be
careful
when
following
him
not
to
trust
its
communications
and
line
of
advance
or
retreat
to
any
temporary
bridge
but
must
use
the
portuguese
riverside
fortress
of
jerumenha
as
its
base
and
construct
there
a
bridge
composed
of
twenty
spanish
which
as
wellington
was
informed
had
been
floated
down
from
badajoz
before
the
siege
of
that
place
began
beresford
was
to
construct
a
strong
on
the
spanish
bank
to
cover
this
bridge
and
might
then
move
forward
and
invest
badajoz
if
he
were
able
wellington
to
beresford
march
vii
you
had
better
lose
no
time
in
moving
up
to
portalegre
and
attack
soult
if
you
can
at
campo
mayor
i
will
come
to
you
if
i
can
but
if
i
can
not
do
not
wait
for
me
get
castaños
to
join
you
from
estremos
with
any
spanish
troops
he
can
bring
you
must
be
two
days

from
portalegre
to

march
vii
some
details
added
from
d
urban
s
diary
which
do
not
appear
in
this
dispatch
a
most
prescient
note
occurs
in
this
dispatch
which
seems
as
if
it
were
written
in
prophetical
foresight
of
what
was
to
happen
at
campo
mayor
five
days
later
the
cavalry
is
the
most
delicate
arm
we
possess
we
have
few
officers
who
have
practical
knowledge
of
the
mode
of
using
it
or
who
have
ever
seen
more
than
two
regiments
together
to
these
circumstances
add
that
the
defeat
of
or
any
great
loss
sustained
by
our
cavalry
in
these
open
grounds
would
be
a
misfortune
amounting
almost
to
a
defeat
of
the
whole
you
will
therefore
see
the
necessity
of
keeping
your
cavalry
as
much
as
possible
and
in
reserve
to
be
thrown
in
at
the
moment
when
opportunity
offers
for
striking
a
decisive
it
looks
almost
as
if
wellington
knew
that
general
long
who
commanded
beresford
s
cavalry
was
going
to
make
the
very
mistakes
that
he
actually
committed
on
the
first
collision
with
the
enemy
the
moment
that
the
division
and
de
grey
s
dragoons
reached
portalegre
beresford
began
his
march
on
campo
mayor
march
sending
out
colborne
s
and
lumley
s
brigades
of
the
division
to
arronches
and
the
portuguese
cavalry
brigade
of
otway
to
azumar
this
unit
had
been
watching
the
frontier
between
the
tagus
and
the
guadiana
ever
since
masséna
s
retreat
from
santarem
and
joined
the
division
on
the
of
march
hamilton
s
portuguese
infantry
division
was
to
follow
next
day
the
division
was
to
be
allowed
two
days
rest
after
its
fatiguing
march
from
the
ceira
and
was
only
to
start
on
the
on
the
the
whole
army
was
to
be
in
front
of
campo
mayor
all
these
details
are
from
d
urban
s
journal
it
remains
to
speak
of
the
position
in
which
the
enemy
was
found
between
the
of
march
when
soult
departed
from
seville
and
the
when
beresford
s
army
made
its
sudden
and
quite
unexpected
descent
into
the
middle
of
the
french
forces
only
eleven
days
elapsed
but
mortier
had
turned
them
to
good
account
and
had
more
than
fulfilled
all
that
had
been
expected
of
him
on
the
very
day
that
soult
started
for
seville
he
marched
against
campo
mayor
with
nine
battalions
of
infantry
a
cavalry
brigade
and
part
of
the
which
had
just
captured
badajoz
one
other
battalion
was
left
as
garrison
in
olivenza
the
six
that
remained
from
the
corps
were
told
off
for
badajoz
where
general
phillipon
had
been
appointed
governor
with
the
aid
of
three
companies
of
sappers
they
were
already
busily
engaged
in
levelling
their
own
old
and
commencing
the
repairs
to
the
battered
front
of
the
walls
mortier
conceived
that
there
could
not
be
any
danger
in
carrying
out
the
orders
that
soult
had
left
for
he
could
find
no
traces
of
any
hostile
force
in
his
vicinity
save
the
portuguese
garrison
of
elvas
and
the
men
who
formed
the
wrecks
of
mendizabal
s
army
this
demoralized
force
had
rallied
at
campo
mayor
but
on
receiving
the
news
of
the
fall
of
badajoz
retired
in
haste
to
estremos
twenty
miles
within
the
portuguese
frontier
their
presence
there
was
a
danger
rather
than
a
defence
to
the
alemtejo
for
not
only
did
they
consume
some
magazines
collected
there
by
wellington
s
orders
for
the
use
of
the
expeditionary
force
but
they
plundered
recklessly
in
the
neighbouring
villages
and
committed
such
outrages
that
the
portuguese
government
was
almost
forced
to
take
military
measures
against
them
mortier
had
nothing
to
fear
from
this
quarter
while
he
could
hear
no
news
of
the
approach
of
any
british
force
from
the
direction
of
the
tagus
the
division
and
hamilton
s
portuguese
it
will
be
remembered
had
only
been
ordered
to
resume
their
movement
towards
estremadura
on
the
by
wellington
s
dispatch
of
the
and
when
mortier
started
from
badajoz
they
were
only
just
commencing
their
advance
from
the
neighbourhood
of
abrantes
towards
crato
and
portalegre
and
were
very
nearly
a
hundred
miles
away
so
that
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
get
any
information
concerning
them
the
consumption
of
the
estremos
magazines
by
mendizabal
s
men
will
be
found
mentioned
in
the
pamphlet
written
under
beresford
s
direction
called
strictures
on
napier
s
peninsular
war
london
when
the
marshal
beresford
put
his
corps
in
motion
from
the
tagus
he
was
informed
that
the
british
commissary
in
the
alemtejo
had
from
to
rations
in
store
for
his
use
but
this
officer
had
also
been
ordered
to
supply
the
spanish
division
lately
in
that
province
and
most
incautiously
issued
for
its
service
whatever
its
commander
required
owing
to
this
inadvertence
on
the
part
of
the
commissary
whose
name
i
think
was
thompson
when
marshal
beresford
arrived
the
store
was
his
name
thompson
and
he
was
immediately
superseded
by
wellington
s
order
vii
campo
mayor
was
an
fortress
which
had
not
been
remodelled
since
the
war
of
the
spanish
succession
its
greatest
weakness
was
that
an
outlying
fort
são
joão
only
yards
from
the
walls
in
a
commanding
position
had
been
dismantled
but
not
blown
up
and
levelled
to
the
ground
it
overlooked
one
of
the
bastions
of
the
place
and
had
only
to
be
seized
in
order
to
provide
an
admirable
for
operations
against
the
enceinte
no
serious
attention
had
been
paid
to
campo
mayor
of
late
the
much
stronger
place
of
elvas
only
eleven
miles
away
having
absorbed
all
the
attention
of
the
portuguese
government
the
spaniards
had
been
garrisoning
it
for
the
last
six
months
but
when
they
hastily
departed
the
governor
of
elvas
threw
into
it
half
a
battalion
of
the
portalegre
militia
about
men
and
a
company
of
artillery
this
handful
of
men
aided
by
the
ordenança
of
the
place
were
all
that
were
at
the
disposition
of
the
very
gallant
and
resourceful
old
engineer
officer
major
josé
joaquim
talaya
who
was
left
in
charge
of
the
place
as
the
population
was
under
souls
the
levy
of
the
ordenança
can
not
have
amounted
to
more
than
men
and
many
of
these
as
was
still
the
case
in
most
parts
of
portugal
had
no
firearms
but
only
pikes
but
the
chief
magistrate
de
josé
carvalho
served
at
the
head
of
them
with
great
energy
and
we
are
assured
that
contrary
to
what
might
have
been
expected
the
citizens
took
a
more
creditable
part
than
the
militiamen
in
the
defence
soriano
da
luz
iii
pp
with
no
regulars
save
the
company
of
artillery
and
no
more
than
men
in
all
to
protect
a
long
enceinte
it
might
have
been
expected
that
talaya
could
make
no
defence
at
all
indeed
he
might
have
evacuated
the
place
without
any
blame
but
being
a
man
of
fine
resolution
and
recognizing
the
fact
that
he
was
doing
the
greatest
possible
service
by
detaining
french
before
his
walls
and
thereby
covering
elvas
and
allowing
time
for
beresford
to
arrive
he
resolved
to
hold
out
as
long
as
possible
the
french
seized
fort
são
joão
on
the
night
of
their
arrival
march
and
opened
trenches
on
each
side
of
it
commencing
at
the
same
time
three
batteries
of
which
two
were
sheltered
by
the
dismantled
work
next
morning
two
of
these
works
were
in
a
position
to
open
fire
on
the
town
since
the
heavy
guns
for
them
had
only
to
come
from
badajoz
a
mere
nine
miles
away
despite
of
this
talaya
held
out
for
seven
days
of
bombardment
and
open
trenches
march
he
concentrated
all
his
artillery
on
the
approaches
and
the
and
for
some
time
held
his
own
on
the
a
breach
was
opened
in
the
projecting
bastion
de
concelho
but
the
governor
refused
a
summons
to
surrender
and
actually
beat
off
an
assault
that
night
on
the
following
day
the
whole
face
of
the
bastion
began
to
crumble
and
since
further
resistance
was
hopeless
talaya
accepted
the
terms
offered
him
by
mortier
viz
that
the
garrison
should
lay
down
its
arms
if
not
relieved
within
hours
the
militia
and
ordenança
not
to
be
regarded
as
prisoners
of
war
but
to
be
allowed
to
stay
in
or
retire
to
their
homes
on
condition
that
they
should
not
again
bear
arms
against
the
french
a
similar
favour
was
extended
to
the
governor
himself
who
was
allowed
on
account
of
his
great
age
says
the
capitulation
to
retire
to
his
own
residence
on
giving
his
word
of
honour
not
to
serve
again
as
the
whole
garrison
save
the
artillery
were
irregular
troops
mortier
took
over
less
than
prisoners
some
fifty
guns
many
of
them
of
very
antique
and
useless
fabric
and
rations
of
biscuit
were
captured
the
delay
of
hours
in
the
surrender
of
the
town
turned
out
very
unluckily
for
mortier
as
it
just
gave
time
for
beresford
and
his
army
to
arrive
only
four
days
after
the
surrender
before
the
place
had
been
dismantled
or
injured
colonel
dickson
met
talaya
only
two
days
after
the
surrender
and
had
an
interesting
interview
with
him
see
dickson
s
he
can
find
no
praise
high
enough
for
the
old
engineer
officer
d
urban
also
speaks
of
him
in
most
appreciative
terms
the
defence
of
the
absolutely
untenable
campo
mayor
contrasts
in
the
strongest
fashion
with
that
of
the
neighbouring
spanish
fortress
of
albuquerque
this
too
was
a
very
neglected
and
antiquated
place
but
it
possessed
a
citadel
on
a
high
crag
which
might
have
been
held
for
some
days
against
anything
but
heavy
artillery
and
it
would
have
taken
some
time
to
erect
batteries
which
could
effectively
reach
it
when
however
with
two
cavalry
regiments
summoned
it
on
march
the
governor
at
once
began
to
parley
and
on
being
told
that
infantry
and
guns
were
coming
forward
actually
opened
his
gates
next
day
before
the
two
battalions
and
two
guns
sent
by
mortier
arrived
this
demoralized
officer
was
josé
cagigal
his
garrison
consisted
of
two
battalions
of
the
estremaduran
regiment
of
fernando
vii
about
men
and
a
few
artillerymen
with
seventeen
brass
guns
of
position
this
was
on
the
whole
the
most
disgraceful
surrender
made
during
the
whole
peninsular
war
it
can
only
be
compared
to
the
celebrated
capitulation
of
stettin
in
when
the
prussian
general
in
an
exactly
similar
fashion
yielded
a
fortress
to
a
brigade
of
hussars
who
were
impudent
enough
to
summon
it
but
stettin
was
a
far
worse
case
than
albuquerque
since
it
was
a
modern
stronghold
with
a
garrison
of
no
less
than
men
after
the
surrender
of
albuquerque
sent
on
a
regiment
of
dragoons
to
valencia
de
alcantara
the
last
fortified
place
in
spanish
hands
between
the
guadiana
and
the
tagus
the
small
garrison
evacuated
it
and
the
dragoons
after
bursting
seven
guns
found
within
its
walls
and
blowing
up
its
gates
march
returned
to
badajoz
the
news
of
the
loss
of
the
one
portuguese
and
the
two
spanish
fortresses
did
not
detain
beresford
a
moment
in
his
advance
indeed
he
was
only
anxious
to
attack
the
enemy
before
he
should
have
either
repaired
and
garrisoned
or
else
dismantled
and
destroyed
campo
mayor
on
the
cole
s
division
having
had
its
two
prescribed
days
of
rest
marched
from
portalegre
to
arronches
where
it
caught
up
the
cavalry
and
the
other
two
divisions
nothing
had
been
discovered
of
the
french
save
some
hussar
vedettes
only
three
miles
north
of
campo
mayor
it
seems
that
beresford
s
approach
came
as
a
complete
surprise
to
mortier
who
had
made
no
preparations
to
meet
it
he
had
withdrawn
the
greater
part
of
the
troops
who
had
formed
the
siege
corps
to
badajoz
and
had
left
to
dismantle
the
place
for
he
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
hold
it
the
cavalry
general
retained
three
of
his
own
regiments

and
and
hussars

infantry

of
horse

a
large
detachment

the
military
train

were
in
charge
not
only
of
the
lately
used
but
of
thirty
pieces
from
the
walls
of
campo
mayor
which
it
was
intended
to
bring
over
to
badajoz
the
rest
of
the
portuguese
guns
were
to
be
burst
as
useless
and
antiquated
the
engineers
were
selecting
sections
of
the
enceinte
which
were
to
be
mined
and
blown
up
the
whole
french
force
was
about
sabres
and
bayonets
plus
the
detachments
of
the
auxiliary
arms
perhaps
men
in
all
there
was
a
very
fair
chance
of
capturing
it
entire
owing
to
the
careless
way
in
which
kept
watch
the
presence
of
scouting
parties
of
portuguese
dragoons
had
been
reported
to
him
but
probably
he
attached
little
importance
to
their
presence
in
this
direction
there
had
been
cavalry
of
that
nation
on
the
estremaduran
frontier
ever
since
january
there
is
great
difficulty
in
making
out
what
were

french

in

to

probably
in
tardy
consequence

the
reports

retired

as

that

were
coming
up
on
a
broad
front
and
at

strong
rode
back
hastily
into
the
town
ordered
the
drums
to
beat
and
directed
infantry
and
cavalry
alike
to
abandon
their
baggage
and
to
form
up
without
a

delay

with

no

started

little
time
back

was
on

the
alarm
was
given
the
allied
cavalry
on
coming
in
sight
of
the
town

the

north
discovered
the
enemy
just
moving
off

in

had
seen
that
his
danger
lay
in
the
probability
that
beresford
would
strike
in
with
the
horse
of
his
van
between
him
and
badajoz
and
so
force
him
to
fight
his
way
through
under
pain
of
being
surrounded
and
captured
if
he
failed
this
indeed
was
beresford
s
intention
but
being
impressed
with
wellington
s
warning
not
to
risk
or
lose
his
cavalry
he
had
ordered
general
long
who
was
in
command
of
the
division
of
that
arm
not
to
commit
himself
against
a
superior
force
and
to
wait
for
the
infantry
to
come
up
if
he
were
in
any
doubt
yet
if
the
opportunity
to
strike
a
blow
occurs
he
must
avail
himself
of
it
the
whole
cavalry
force
with
the
army
was
only
eleven
british
squadrons
and
five
portuguese
the
latter
very
weak
and
the
total
number
of
sabres
was
about
a
very
small
allowance
for
an
army
of
over
men
and
therefore
very
precious
belmas
says
that
it
had
started
and
must
be
right
while
lapéne
who
thinks
that
it
was
loaded
up
and
sent
off
after
the
alarm
fails
to
account
for
its
being
six
miles
along
the
road
when
surprised
heavy
guns
travel
slowly
beresford
corroborates
belmas
this
is
long
s
account
of
the
orders
given
by
beresford
of
the
of
the
military
reputation
of
the
late
general
by
long
in
a
letter
from
the
general
to
general
le
marchant
this
agrees
pretty
well
with
beresford
s
version
of
the
facts
and
is
no
doubt
correct
when
saw
the
british
divisions
coming
on
in
the
distance
he
marched
off
with
all
possible
speed
and
had
such
a
start
that
his
column
whose
pace
was
set
by
the
quick
step
of
the
infantry
had
got
nearly
three
miles
from
campo
mayor
before
it
was
seriously
threatened
general
long
had
by
beresford
s
orders
directed
his
squadrons
to
sweep
east
of
the
walls
of
the
town
out
of
gunshot
in
case
there
should
chance
to
have
been
a
garrison
left
behind
the
sweep
was
a
long
one
because
a
ravine
was
discovered
which
forced
the
regiments
to
turn
further
eastward
than
was
at
first
intended
they
came
up
in
two
detachments
one
formed
by
the
light
dragoons
and
otway
s
portuguese
more
to
the
left
east
the
other
of
de
grey
s
dragoons
further
to
the
right
west
the
first
body
was
nearly
level
with
the
dragoon
regiment
which
was
moving
ahead
of
the
french
column
the
other
was
not
so
far
to
the
front
being
or
yards
away
from
the
rear
flank
of
the
french
the
nearest
british
infantry
and
guns
colborne
s
brigade
and
cleeves
s
german
battery
accompanying
it
were
out
of
sight
two
miles
to
the
rear
hidden
by
undulations
of
the
ground
so
was
beresford
himself
and
his
staff
who
were
riding
ahead
of
the
main
body
seeing
a
fight
forced
on
him
resolved
to
accept
it
he
had
a
force
of
all
arms
and
thought
himself
strong
enough
to
beat
off
cavalry
unsupported
by
infantry
or
guns
even
though
they
outnumbered
his
own
horsemen
in
the
proportion
of
five
to
three
accordingly
he
suddenly
halted
and
formed
his
infantry
in
battalion
squares
on
the
with
the
hussars
flanking
them
in
deep
order
while
the
dragoon
regiment
with
its
right
wing
drawn
back
and
its
left
wing
not
far
from
the
leading
hussars
formed
a
line
at
an
obtuse
angle
to
the
main
body
ready
to
deliver
a
flanking
charge
on
the
british
and
portuguese
if
they
should
attack
the
infantry
long
considering
as
he
says
that
he
was
strong
enough
to
attempt
the
blow
of
which
beresford
had
spoken
resolved
first
to
drive
off
the
french
dragoon
regiment
which
threatened
his
flank
and
then
to
fall
upon
the
hussars
and
infantry
he
sent
orders
to
de
grey
and
the
heavy
dragoons
to
close
in
upon
the
rear
and
left
flank
of
the
french
from
whom
they
were
still
separated
by
a
ridge
but
to
hold
off
till
the
rest
of
the
troops
had
disposed
of
the
covering
cavalry
he
then
advanced
with
the
light
squadrons
english
and
portuguese
to
get
beyond
the
french
dragoons
his
line

formed
with
two
portuguese
squadrons

a

over

the
dragoons
to

before
the

was

advanced

british
formed
to
their

started
to
meet
them
the
two
lines
met
with
a
tremendous
crash
neither
giving
way
and
were
mingled
for
a
few
moments
in
desperate
hand
to
hand
fighting
in
which

chamorin
the
french
brigadier
was
slain
in
a
personal
combat
with

broke
and
fled

followed
one
of
those
wild
and
senseless
pursuits
which
always
provoked
wellington
s
wrath
and
induced
him
to
say
in
bitterness
that
the
ordinary
british
cavalry
regiment
was
good
for
nothing
but
galloping
general
long
says
in
his
account
of
the
affair
that
he
found
it
impossible
to
stop
or
rally
the
light
dragoons
and
therefore
sent
after
them
the
two
squadrons
of
the
portuguese
to
act
as
a
support

the
portuguese
put
on
a
great
pace
to
come
up

camp
the
pursuers
should
have
stopped
here
there
was
no
object
in
chasing
any
further
the
few
surviving
french
dragoons
who
were
scattered
broadcast
the
guns
with
a
long
train
of
caissons
and
carts
were
left
standing
beside
the
road
but
little
attention
was
paid
to
these
valuable
trophies
one
or
two
were
rehorsed
and
turned
towards
the
british
lines
by
some
officers
of
the
the
main
body
of
the
pursuers
however
did
not
stop
with
the
convoy
but
still
sabring
at
the
routed
french
rode
two
miles
and
a
half
further
till
they
hurtled
against
the
fortifications
of
badajoz
they
were
only
stopped
by
being
shelled
from
fort
san
cristobal
and
fired
on
by
the
garrison
of
the
it
is
said
by
one
french
authority
that
the
leading
dragoons
actually
reached
the
of
the
covered
way
of
the
latter
work
and
were
shot
there
marshal
mortier
learning
what
had
happened
sallied
out
of
the
fortress
with
a
cavalry
regiment
and
four
battalions
captured
quite
a
number
of
straggling
dragoons
whose
horses
had
fallen
or
given
out
in
the
wild
ride
and
found
the
bulk
of
the
artillery
convoy
standing
lonely
and
teamless
by
the
wayside
it
was
dragged
along
into
badajoz
save
one
howitzer
and
six
caissons
which
were
left
behind
on
the
approach
of
beresford
s
main
body
mortier
also
picked
up
near
the
place
where
the
convoy
was
lying
and
brought
into
badajoz

iii
when
the
light
dragoons
and
the
portuguese
went
off
on
their
mad
escapade
general
long
found
himself
left
in
front
of
the
main
french
force
with
only
the
three
squadrons
of
the
portuguese
cavalry
which
had
formed
his
reserve
and
the
heavy
brigade
distant
half
a
mile
from
him
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
french
line
it
was
apparently
his
intention
to
charge
the
enemy
with
these
troops
a
most
hazardous
experiment
for
the
french
with
a
regiment
of
infantry
in
square
flanked
by
four
squadrons
of
hussars
were
dangerous
to
deal
with
in
all
the
peninsular
war
there
was
only
one
occasion
at
garcia
hernandez
in
where
formed
squares
of
either
side
were
broken
by
the
cavalry
of
the
other
and
the
ligne
on
this
occasion
had
hussars
to
support
them
there
was
some
delay
while
long
was
sending
an
to
the
heavy
brigade
to
bid
them
prepare
to
attack
and
seeing
him
holding
back
started
off
his
column
once
more
along
the
the
infantry
marching
in
square
with
two
squadrons
of
hussars
in
front
and
two
behind
to
stop
him
from
moving
on
long
brought
forward
the
portuguese
to
check
the
hussars
but
when
they
advanced
toward
them
and
were
about
to
engage
the
front
side
of
the
leading
french
battalion
square
opened
a
distant
fire
against
their
flank
surprised
by
this
for
they
had
not
realized
that
they
were
within
effective
range
of
the
hostile
infantry
the
three
portuguese
squadrons
broke
and
galloped
off
pursued
by
the
hussars
for
some
little
way
so
at
least
i
gather
from
long
s
narrative
he
says
that
he
sent
an
order
for
the
advance
of
de
grey
s
brigade
and
in
another
place
that
it
was
only
necessary
to
charge
and
throw
into
confusion
the
cavalry
at
their
the
french
head
and
rear
and
the
object
was
the
object
is
defined
as
the
annihilation
of
the
french
column
which
long
thinks
would
have
surrendered
this
regiment
lost
one
officer
and
ten
men
killed
and
wounded
beside
some
prisoners
in
the
abortive
advance
the
french
statement
that
the
hussars
made
de
belles
charges
is
therefore
evidently
justified
but
it
was
the
flanking
infantry
fire
which
demoralized
the
portuguese
long
s
at
this
moment
marshal
beresford
and
his
staff
came
upon
the
scene
on
the
ridge
near
de
grey
s
brigade
and
saw
the
three
portuguese
squadrons
rallying
at
a
distance
and
still
in
disorder
while
the
heavy
dragoons
were
preparing
to
attack
on
inquiring
what
had
become
of
the
and
the
rest
of
the
portuguese
beresford
was
told
by
one
of
his
staff
that
they
had
been
cut
off
and
were
believed
to
have
been
captured
horrified
at
this
news
which
brought
to
his
mind
all
wellington
s
warnings
beresford
forbade
the
heavy
brigade
to
charge
and
bade
them
hold
off
till
some
infantry
and
guns
should
come
up
he
was
indubitably
right
in
so
doing
for
as
all
previous
and
later
experience
proved
it
was
most
unlikely
that
they
would
have
broken
the
french
squares
by
all
accounts
this
was
baron
trip
a
dutch
officer
who
was
serving
on
beresford
s
staff
the
statement
was
very
astounding
even
incredible
considering
that
the
country
was
open
and
undulating
but
it
was
almost
equally
incredible
that
the
and
portuguese
should
have
pursued
the
french
dragoons
completely
out
of
sight
six
miles
away
without
leaving
a
man
behind
he
sent
back
for
the
nearest
infantry
which
was
colborne
s
brigade
and
some
guns
meanwhile
the
enemy
continued
moving
off
at
a
great
pace
followed
at
a
distance
by
the
heavy
dragoons
while
long
and
the
three
rallied
portuguese
squadrons
marched
parallel
with
their
flank
the
two
parties
had
proceeded
several
miles
in
this
way
when
the
light
dragoons
came
in
sight
returning
from
the
direction
of
badajoz
and
their
portuguese
companions
with
them
soon
after
two
guns
of
cleeves
s
battery
got
up
unlimbered
and
opened
a
fire
at
long
range
against
the
rear
of
the
french
it
had
some
effect
but
the
enemy
kept
his
ranks
and
continued
to
move
on
as
fast
as
possible
leaving
his
dead
and
wounded
in
the
road
the
artillery
horses
were
exhausted
and
unable
to
keep
up
wherefore
beresford
ordered
the
whole
force
to
halt
saying
that
without
infantry
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
done
at
this
moment
colborne
s
brigade
was
no
more
than
half
a
mile
behind
according
to
long
and
certain
other
witnesses
but
on
the
other
hand
mortier
with
infantry
and
a
cavalry
regiment
from
badajoz
was
visible
waiting
for
near
the
spot
where
the
dismantled
convoy
was
standing
the
two
french
forces
joined
and
retired
into
the
fortress
with
nearly
all
the
recaptured
guns
only
one
and
some
caissons
remained
to
be
picked
up
by
beresford
s
advance
colonel
gabriel
a
staff
officer
of
the
division
says
that
colborne
s
brigade
was
only
yards
in
rear
of
the
heavy
dragoons
and
the
french
still
in
sight
when
beresford
ordered
the
final
halt
see
long
s
the
loss
of
the
british
on
this
occasion
all
in
the
light
dragoons
was
killed
officers
and
men
wounded
and
prisoners
among
the
portuguese
and
cavalry
an
officer
and
men
killed
wounded
and
prisoners
a
total
of
over
the
french
suffered
more
the
dragoons
alone
had
officers
and
over
men
killed
wounded
and
taken
the
train
and
artillery
had
been
dreadfully
cut
up
at
the
capture
of
the
convoy
and
the
infantry
had
lost
officers
and
many
men
by
the
fire
of
cleeves
s
guns
the
total
casualties
were
over
but
the
moral
effect
of
a
combat
is
not
judged
by
a
mere
comparison
of
losses
and
the
british
officers
were
much
disappointed
beresford
and
his
friends
held
that
long
had
by
mismanagement
wasted
precious
cavalrymen
long
declared
that
if
beresford
had
not
taken
the
command
out
of
his
hands
he
would
have
captured
the
whole
french
column
this
last
claim
was
absolutely
unreasonable
it
is
far
more
likely
that
he
would
merely
have
caused
severe
loss
to
the
two
heavy
dragoon
regiments
by
persisting
the
marshal
and
the
general
were
on
bad
terms
from
this
moment
onward
and
the
former
took
the
next
opportunity
given
him
to
remove
the
latter
from
the
chief
command
of
the
allied
cavalry
the
most
curious
comment
on
the
combat
of
campo
mayor
is
napier
s
statement
that
the
light
dragoons
were
severely
reprimanded
for
pursuing
so
eagerly
but
the
unsparing
admiration
of
the
whole
army
consoled
them
pursuing
eagerly
is
a
mild
expression
for
riding
seven
miles
off
the
battlefield
and
on
to
the
glacis
of
a
hostile
fortress
wellington
s
comment
was
that
the
undisciplined
ardour
of
the
dragoons
and
the
regiment
of
portuguese
cavalry
is
not
of
the
description
of
the
determined
bravery
of
soldiers
confident
in
their
discipline
and
their
officers
their
conduct
was
that
of
a
rabble
galloping
as
fast
as
their
horses
could
carry
them
after
an
enemy
to
whom
they
could
do
no
further
mischief
when
they
were
broken
the
pursuit
was
continued
for
an
unlimited
distance
and
sacrificed
substantial
advantages
and
all
the
objects
of
the
operation
by
want
of
discipline
a
similar
reproof
was
published
in
a
general
order
to
be
read
to
the
cavalry
except
three
wounded
in
the
dragoon
guards
in
skirmishes
with
the
hussars
of
the
french
rearguard
one
killed
six
wounded
one
prisoner

names

lists
and
supplement
thereto
belmas
says
but
this
is
too
low
wellington
to
beresford
from
celorico
march
vii
by
an
odd
error
wellington
wrote
the
portuguese
but
it
was
the
which
joined
in
the
hunt
the
only
really
satisfactory
result
of
the
combat
of
campo
mayor
was
that
beresford
recovered
the
town
intact
with
some
guns
which
had
not
yet
been
sent
off
to
badajoz
and
a
considerable
amount
of
stores
including
rations
of
biscuit
the
place
was
at
once
with
the
faro
regiment
of
militia
from
elvas
who
rapidly
repaired
the
breach
it
was
tenable
again
in
a
few
days
on
the
beresford
discovered
that
the
french
had
withdrawn
entirely
beyond
the
guadiana
keeping
nothing
north
of
it
save
the
and
fort
san
cristobal
at
badajoz
all
accounts
agreed
that
after
deducting
the
garrison
of
that
place
mortier
could
not
have
more
than
or
at
the
most
men
available
for
the
field
so
that
there
was
no
reason
why
wellington
s
orders
to
thrust
him
out
of
estremadura
and
besiege
badajoz
should
not
be
carried
out
it
was
particularly
directed
in
those
orders
that
the
expeditionary
force
should
cross
the
guadiana
at
jerumenha
and
make
a
bridge
at
that
place
only
a
few
miles
from
the
strong
fortress
of
elvas
the
base
of
its
line
of
communications
accordingly
the
division
and
hamilton
s
portuguese
marched
to
elvas
on
the
leaving
cole
and
the
division
still
much
fatigued
by
their
long
march
for
a
day
at
campo
mayor
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
beresford
had
been
able
to
cross
at
jerumenha
on
the
or
he
would
have
compelled
the
french
to
retire
southward
at
once
and
might
have
invested
badajoz
then
not
yet
fully
repaired
as
soon
as
he
chose
but
a
most
tiresome
series
of
hindrances
for
which
it
seems
unjust
to
blame
the
commander
now
began
to
crop
up
the
first
and
most
fatal
was
that
the
stock
of
spanish
pontoon
boats
which
as
he
had
been
told
by
wellington
would
be
found
at
elvas
or
jerumenha
was
not
forthcoming
only
five
were
discovered
two
complete
had
been
kept
by
imaz
at
badajoz
and
were
now
in
the
hands
of
the
french
but
twenty
large
pontoons
as
the
engineers
declared
was
the
least
number
which
would
suffice
to
bridge
the
guadiana
an
attempt
was
made
to
seek
for
to
eke
out
the
pontoons
but
by
wellington
s
orders
all
the
boats
on
the
river
for
many
miles
had
been
destroyed
when
soult
entered
estremadura
in
january
some
portuguese
pontoons
were
ordered
from
lisbon
but
it
would
be
a
week
or
so
before
they
could
be
carted
across
the
alemtejo
meanwhile
captain
squire
the
engineer
charged
with
the
offered
to
lay
trestles
across
the
shallower
part
of
the
bed
of
the
guadiana
on
either
bank
and
to
moor
the
five
pontoons
in
the
deep
channel
in
the
middle
to
join
them
to
this
beresford
assented
and
the
was
selected
on
the
squire
promised
that
the
whole
should
be
completed
on
the
of
april
he
could
not
finish
it
earlier
as
the
wood
for
the
trestles
had
to
be
found
cut
down
and
shaped
napier
censures
beresford
for
not
crossing
at
merida
thirty
miles
east
of
badajoz
but
wellington
s
orders
directed
him
to
use
jerumenha
to
march
to
merida
would
have
been
to
pass
across
the
front
of
an
enemy
who
had
a
at
badajoz
from
which
he
could
push
out
detachments
to
cut
the
line
of
communication
campo
mayor
to
merida
elvas
was
the
only
possible
base
and
the
only
place
where
magazines
could
be
safely
formed
or
munitions
siege
artillery
procured
the
road
campo
was
very
bad
merida
was
within
reach
of
the
french
army
of
the
centre
which
had
detachments
at
truxillo
and
almaraz
the
delay
of
a
week
thus
caused
was
of
the
less
importance
however
because
of
another
contretemps
there
were
no
stores
ready
to
feed
the
army
when
it
should
cross
the
guadiana
the
rations
at
estremos
which
wellington
as
it
will
be
remembered
had
promised
to
beresford
were
found
to
have
been
entirely
consumed
by
the
wreck
of
mendizabal
s
army
who
had
been
lying
there
for
the
last
three
weeks
there
was
nothing
to
lade
upon
the
mules
and
carts
of
the
expeditionary
force
the
troops
were
in
great
difficulties
from
day
to
day
ate
the
rations
at
campo
mayor
and
were
finally
forced
to
indent
upon
the
stores
of
the
garrison
of
elvas
which
ought
to
have
been
sacred
to
the
defence
of
the
town
lastly
and
this
was
perhaps
the
most
important
of
all
the
shoes
of
the
division
which
had
marched
continuously
from
the
to
the
of
march
first
from
the
lines
to
espinhal
and
then
from
espinhal
to
portalegre
were
completely
worn
out
cole
protested
against
the
division
being
moved
till
it
was
reshod
no
footgear
could
be
found
at
elvas
and
though
an
immediate
requisition
was
sent
to
lisbon
the
convoy
bringing
the
shoes
would
obviously
take
a
week
or
so
to
get
up
from
the
of
march
to
the
of
april
beresford
was
perforce
immovable
this
loss
of
eight
days
was
apparently
the
reason
why
badajoz
did
not
fall
into
his
hands
a
little
later
for
the
fortifications
which
were
still
in
a
dangerous
state
of
disrepair
on
the
were
practically
tenable
by
the
second
week
in
april
the
stores
in
the
fortress
were
a
less
important
matter
imaz
when
he
surrendered
had
over
a
month
s
rations
for
men
which
even
when
a
certain
amount
had
been
consumed
by
soult
s
field
army
left
a
nucleus
sufficient
to
keep
the
garrison
of
men
placed
in
the
town
by
mortier
out
of
need
for
many
weeks
in
addition
cattle
had
been
requisitioned
all
over
estremadura
the
small
movable
force
of
men
which
was
available
for
observing
beresford
was
now
living
entirely
on
the
in
order
to
spare
the
stores
of
badajoz
these
notes
as
to
beresford
s
difficulties
are
taken
partly
from
the
journal
of
his
chief
of
the
staff
d
urban
partly
from
the
latter
s
detailed
report
on
the
estremaduran
campaign
published
in
but
written
in
partly
from
the
on
napier
s
vol
iii
written
under
beresford
s
eye
the
latter
might
be
considered
suspicious
if
they
were
not
completely
borne
out
by
the
two
former
as
well
as
by
wellington
s
vii
beresford
s
delay
in
crossing
the
guadiana
therefore
was
unfortunate
but
apparently
inevitable
and
there
seems
no
reason
to
blame
him
for
it
on
april
the
engineers
reported
that
the
bridge
at
jerumenha
would
be
ready
that
evening
and
the
three
divisions
concentrated
on
the
left
bank
the
water
was
low
and
a
difficult
ford
for
cavalry
had
been
found
above
the
bridge
by
which
a
squadron
of
dragoons
passed
and
established
a
chain
of
pickets
on
the
spanish
side
no
french
were
seen
abroad
though
it
was
discovered
that
they
still
had
a
garrison
in
olivenza
only
six
miles
away
it
is
difficult
to
make
out
why
no
attempt
was
made
to
obstruct
the
building
of
beresford
s
bridge
the
enemy
had
five
regiments
of
cavalry
in
estremadura
and
infantry
of
girard
s
division
were
available
for
field
service
even
a
small
detachment
with
some
guns
would
have
made
it
impossible
for
the
british
engineers
to
complete
their
work
but
the
allies
found
a
great
advantage
in
the
fact
that
mortier
had
just
received
orders
to
return
to
paris
and
had
on
march
handed
over
the
command
of
all
the
troops
on
the
guadiana
to
who
was
a
good
divisional
general
on
the
battlefield
but
a
very
indifferent
strategist
all
his
manœuvres
during
the
following
month
were
weak
and
confused
how
it
came
that
from
the
of
march
to
the
of
april
no
french
cavalry
were
seen
opposite
jerumenha
much
less
any
serious
force
sent
to
disturb
the
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
by
all
accounts
the
horsemen
who
should
have
been
in
front
of
olivenza
were
at
this
time
mainly
employed
in
scouring
the
villages
of
central
estremadura
for
cattle
and
corn
and
escorting
what
they
could
seize
into
badajoz
and
the
camp
of
girard
s
division
on
the
morning
of
march
when
the
allied
troops
should
have
crossed
the
guadiana
beresford
was
brought
the
untoward
news
that
the
river
had
risen
three
feet
in
the
night
had
swept
away
the
trestles
and
forced
the
engineers
to
draw
back
the
five
pontoon
boats
in
the
central
stream
to
the
portuguese
bank
the
squadron
beyond
the
river
was
cut
off
from
the
army
and
communication
with
it
was
only
restored
during
the
day
by
rigging
up
a
flying
bridge
composed
of
a
raft
and
a
rope
the
cavalry
ford
above
the
destroyed
bridge
was
of
course
impassable
throughout
the
and
the
water
continued
to
rise
from
storms
higher
up
the
river
apparently
for
there
was
no
rain
at
jerumenha
the
position
was
exasperating
to
the
highest
degree
establishing
a
permanent
bridge
is
out
of
the
question
writes
d
urban
the
chief
of
the
staff
in
his
journal
the
means
are
anything
but
secure
either
for
passing
the
army
tedious
beyond
measure
too
no
doubt
or
for
establishing
a
communication
afterwards
for
supplies
and
other
purposes
nevertheless
the
general
state
of
things
and
above
all
lord
wellington
s
reiterated
orders
received
this
morning
render
it
necessary
to
pass
the
engineers
put
upon
their
mettle
finally
made
the
five
spanish
pontoon
boats
into
two
flying
bridges
worked
by
ropes
on
these
a
battalion
of
infantry
was
passed
across
the
river
and
stockaded
itself
on
the
other
side
later
in
the
day
april
some
small
tin
pontoons
arrived
from
lisbon
and
out
of
these
helped
by
all
the
of
the
neighbouring
villages
collected
in
haste
a
floating
bridge
was
constructed
not
very
substantial
but
upon
trial
found
capable
of
admitting
infantry
to
pass
in
file
it
was
not
ready
till
noon
on
the
but
by
the
two
flying
bridges
the
whole
division
and
three
squadrons
of
cavalry
were
passed
on
the
night
of
the
what
might
have
happened
it
had
concentrated
at
olivenza
and
fallen
on
the
first
two
or
three
battalions
that
crossed
with
a
force
of
all
arms
we
had
better
not
inquire
a
disaster
on
a
small
scale
might
very
possibly
have
occurred
but

maintained
that

on

could
be
protected
by
the
fire
of
the

of
jerumenha
which
is
in
a
lofty

commanding

they

that
the

of

were
not
over
till
the
following

ere
they
were
all
across

regrettable
incident
occurred
the

pickets
were
formed
on
the
night
of
the
by

morris

squadron
of
the
light
dragoons
owing
to

work
in
the
placing
of
them
as
d
urban
and
general
long
both
assert
the
main
guard
of
this
squadron
was
surprised
by
french
cavalry
in
the
dusk
of
the
morning
and
captured
almost
entire
two
officers
and
fifty
men
being
taken
the
assailants
found
that
they
had
run
into
the
camp
of
a
whole
army
and
promptly
retired
before
they
could
be
touched
at
last
had
given
signs
of
life
this
reconnaissance
had
been
conducted
by
a
flying
column
of
two
cavalry
regiments
and
four
battalions
under
general
veilland
sent
out
to
olivenza
from
the
camp
of
girard
s
division
with
the
very
tardy
purpose
of
hindering
beresford
s
passage
veilland
reported
to
his
chief
that
the
enemy
was
across
in
such
strength
that
he
could
do
nothing
the
appearance
of
men
on
the
spanish
bank
of
the
guadiana
so
far
to
the
south
of
badajoz
placed
in
a
very
delicate
position
if
he
stayed
hours
longer
in
his
present
camp
close
to
badajoz
he
lost
his
communications
with
andalusia
and
might
be
pushed
eastward
up
the
guadiana
out
of
touch
with
soult
and
having
no
retreat
save
towards
the
distant
army
of
the
centre
it
was
even
possible
that
a
rapid
advance
of
the
allies
might
drive
him
into
badajoz
the
last
thing
that
he
would
desire
accordingly
he
concentrated
at
albuera
twelve
miles
south
of
that
fortress
as
a
preliminary
move
and
prepared
to
fall
back
from
thence
by
the
great
southern
towards
llerena
and
the
sierra
morena
where
he
would
preserve
and
shorten
his
line
of
communication
with
soult
phillipon
was
left
with
men
in
badajoz
which
was
now
quite
beyond
danger
from
a
de
and
able
to
take
care
of
itself
for
some
weeks
till
reinforcements
should
come
up
from
andalusia
for
its
relief
with
great
unwisdom
left
olivenza
garrisoned
also
it
was
as
had
been
shown
in
january
contemptible
as
a
fortress
even
when
held
by
a
large
force
and
the
french
general
placed
in
it
only
a
single
weak
battalion
of
under
men
there
were
still
on
the
walls
the
few
guns
that
had
been
taken
from
the
spaniards
no
more
than
fifteen
were
mounted
and
several
of
these
only
on
makeshift
carriages
why
chose
to
sacrifice
a
battalion
it
is
hard
to
see
napoleon
wrote
to
soult
a
month
later
to
condemn
the
policy
of
small
garrisons
in
the
strongest
terms
at
the
best
olivenza
when
so
weakly
held
could
not
hold
out
for
more
than
a
few
days
and
if
beresford
had
tried
to
rush
it
by
escalade
when
first
he
arrived
before
its
walls
he
must
undoubtedly
have
succeeded
for
men
can
not
defend
three
miles
of
enceinte
against
a
serious
assault
there
were
some
magazines
in
the
place
and
a
small
hospital
of
sick
who
could
not
be
removed
but
it
was
obviously
absurd
to
throw
away
a
battalion
of
sound
men
to
keep
them
from
capture
for
a
few
days
it
has
been
suggested
that
merely
wanted
to
gain
time
but
the
time
gained
was
trifling
olivenza
only
held
out
five
days
and
might
have
fallen
much
sooner

on

almost
unable

was
left
to
besiege
it
with
the
aid
of
heavy
guns
to
be
brought
from
elvas
only
fifteen
miles
away
the
extreme
weakness
of
the
garrison
was
not
known
or
the
marshal
would
not
have
wasted
time
by
ordering
regular
approaches
to
be
made
the
rest
of
the
army
bivouacked
on
the
badajoz
road
a
few
miles
beyond
olivenza
and
on
the
following
day
occupied
valverde
and
pushed
its
cavalry
to
albuera
cutting
the
between
badajoz
and
seville
no
enemy
could
be
found
and
it
was
ascertained
that
s
rearguard
was
at
santa
marta
ten
miles
to
the
south
and
the
rest
of
his
troops
far
beyond
it
on
the
the
infantry
minus
the
division
were
at
albuera
while
the
bulk
of
the
cavalry
marched
to
find
out
how
far
southward
the
enemy
was
ready
to
withdraw
central
estremadura
at
any
rate
was
now
in
beresford
s
hands
and
he
was
in
a
position
to
carry
out
wellington
s
orders
to
drive
the
corps
over
the
sierra
morena
and
invest
badajoz
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
he
had
seen
castaños
on
march
and
settled
with
him
that
the
wrecks
of
the
old
army
of
estremadura
now
about
horse
and
foot
should
join
in
the
campaign
castaños
who
showed
himself
both
eager
and
obliging
had
promised
that
his
infantry
should
seize
the
bridge
of
merida
and
that
when
it
was
occupied
his
cavalry
under
penne
villemur
should
join
in
the
movement
to
sweep
over
the
mountains
operating
on
the
eastern
road
while
the
allied
cavalry
took
the
western
one
these
promises
were
carried
out
morillo
s
infantry
division
occupied
merida
on
the
and
next
day
penne
villemur
s
cavalry
had
reached
almendralejo
the
siege
of
olivenza
gave
little
trouble
the
only
difficulty
was
the
improvising
of
a
even
on
the
very
modest
scale
required
to
deal
with
such
a
weak
place
it
was
invested
as
we
have
seen
on
the
on
the
major
alexander
dickson
of
the
portuguese
artillery
and
captain
squire
of
the
engineers
reconnoitred
the
place
and
determined
that
the
proper
for
the
attack
was
the
same
ruined
lunette
outside
the
walls
which
the
french
had
chosen
as
their
first
base
in
january
on
the
night
of
the
this
point
was
occupied
with
the
loss
of
one
man
only
killed
by
the
enemy
s
fire
a
battery
for
six
guns
was
constructed
in
the
gorge
of
the
ruined
work
but
the
pieces
themselves
which
dickson
went
to
choose
from
elvas
did
not
arrive
till
the
the
at
jerumenha
being
too
weak
to
bear
them
they
and
their
ammunition
had
to
be
ferried
over
on
the
flying
bridges
the
six
were
placed
in
position
that
same
night
at
daybreak
they
opened
and
by
the
time
that
they
had
fired
seventy
rounds
each
long
ere
noon
a
practicable
breach
was
made
in
the
nearest
bastion
thereupon
the
governor
seeing
that
to
have
stood
an
assault
with
his
handful
of
men
would
have
been
madness
surrendered
at
discretion
he
marched
out
with
only
officers
and
men
under
arms
giving
up
also
sick
and
some
commissaries
and
medical
officers
several
of
his
miserable
stock
of
fifteen
guns
were
found
to
be
practically
useless
save
to
make
a
noise
for
as
has
already
been
mentioned
they
were
fixed
not
on
proper
carriages
but
on
the
main
timbers
and
wheels
of
and
could
not
be
elevated
or
depressed
the
governor
deserves
some
credit
for
having
held
out
five
days
if
the
allies
had
been
aware
of
the
weakness
of
the
garrison
they
would
have
swamped
it
at
once
by
an
escalade
on
the
next
morning
april
cole
and
the
division
who
had
at
last
received
their
supply
of
shoes
marched
to
join
the
rest
of
the
army
a
portuguese
garrison
was
thrown
into
olivenza
but
there
was
no
intention
to
hold
it
if
the
enemy
should
come
up
again
it
was
only
a
beresford
might
now
have
invested
badajoz
if
it
had
pleased
him
so
to
do
but
he
thought
it
better
to
drive
completely
out
of
estremadura
and
across
the
sierra
morena
before
taking
the
siege
in
hand
the
main
reason
for
his
resolve
was
that
it
was
clear
that
a
week
or
ten
days
at
least
would
be
required
to
organize
a
at
elvas
for
the
bombardment
and
breaching
of
the
fortress
and
he
thought
it
more
profitable
to
spend
this
interval
in
pushing
the
french
as
far
from
badajoz
as
possible
rather
than
in
sitting
down
before
it
to
no
purpose
and
waiting
for
the
appearance
of
the
it
was
apparently
an
omission
on
wellington
s
part
not
to
have
ordered
general
leite
the
governor
of
elvas
to
begin
making
preparations
for
the
gathering
of
a
park
and
the
collection
of
a
large
body
of
artillerymen
on
the
same
day
that
he
finally
launched
beresford
s
force
into
estremadura
march
but
this
had
not
been
done
and
it
was
not
till
april
that
major
alexander
dickson
who
had
already
learnt
what
was
available
in
elvas
while
organizing
the
little
train
required
for
the
capture
of
olivenza
was
directed
to
take
in
hand
the
much
larger
and
more
difficult
task
of
collecting
the
men
and
material
destined
for
the
siege
of
a
fortress
this
delay
seems
extraordinary
did
wellington
think
on
march
that
badajoz
only
five
days
in
the
hands
of
the
french
at
the
moment
would
be
incapable
of
defence
when
beresford
should
appear
in
front
of
it
about
the
of
that
same
month
it
is
quite
possible
that
this
would
have
been
the
case
and
that
the
french
would
have
blown
it
up
if
the
jerumenha
bridge
had
been
standing
ready
for
the
passage
of
the
army
on
the
next
day
as
wellington
had
supposed
the
give
us
no
help
on
this
point
wellington
speaks
of
investing
badajoz
but
gives
no
hint
as
to
how
the
investment
was
to
be
followed
up
till
march
when
he
observes
to
beresford
that
elvas
must
supply
the
means
for
the
attack
on
badajoz
if
possible
if
it
has
them
not
i
must
send
them
there
this
will
take
time
but
that
can
not
be
avoided
dickson
s
recently
published
by
major
leslie
are
the
first
and
most
important
source
in
which
to
study
the
two
early
british
sieges
of
badajoz
as
well
as
the
smaller
matter
of
olivenza
i
am
using
them
perpetually
all
through
the
following
pages
this
date
is
that
given
by
d
urban
s
vii
from
gouvea
march
elvas
as
matters
turned
out
did
supply
the
means
but
the
resources
to
be
found
there
were
so
limited
that
as
was
wittily
said
at
the
time
by
picton
wellington
both
in
may
and
in
june
sued
badajoz
forma
and
if
the
place
had
fallen
it
would
have
been
almost
a
miracle
for
no
sufficient
material
to
ensure
its
capture
had
been
collected
even
by
the
month
of
june
the
main
difficulty
arose
from
the
fact
that
wellington
had
never
been
provided
by
his
government
with
a
looking
upon
the
war
in
portugal
as
essentially
defensive
in
character
the
home
authorities
had
forgotten
that
it
might
have
offensive
episodes
and
that
a
great
siege
might
not
impossibly
be
one
of
them
the
british
army
in
portugal
possessed
nothing
in
the
way
of
artillery
save
the
ordinary
horse
and
field
batteries
or
troops
and
companies
as
they
were
then
called
with
their
and
guns
if
a
few
hundred
men
were
told
off
to
heavy
pieces
in
the
lisbon
lines
during
the
preceding
autumn
it
was
not
that
they
were
intended
for
such
service
they
were
parts
of
incomplete
or
unhorsed
batteries
which
had
not
taken
the
field
when
the
campaign
of
began
and
were
waiting
to
complete
their
equipment
the
british
army
in
portugal
was
absolutely
destitute
of
artillery
destined
for
and
trained
to
the
working
of
the
only
british
pieces
of
heavy
calibre
used
in
the
spring
of
were
ships
cannon
lent
by
the
commander
of
the
squadron
in
the
tagus
for
such
work
as
was
now
before
them
therefore
the
allies
had
to
depend
entirely
on
what
the
portuguese
arsenals
could
supply
but
all
that
could
be
found
in
them
was
now
mounted
on
the
interminable
redoubts
of
the
lisbon
lines
save
such
as
had
been
sent
to
strengthen
elvas
abrantes
and
peniche
practically
every
gun
in
portugal
was
defending
some
work
small
or
great
they
had
all
been
requisitioned
down
to
the
most
antique
and
imperfect
pieces
the
walls
of
elvas
were
a
perfect
museum
of
ancient
artillery
among
the
heaviest
pieces
carefully
sorted
out
because
of
their
calibre
and
chosen
for
the
that
was
to
batter
badajoz
were
to
be
seen
not
only
many
bearing
the
arms
and
cyphers
of
the
earliest
kings
of
the
house
of
braganza
joão
and
affonso
but
still
older
brass
guns
of
enormous
length
showing
the
names
of
philip
iii
and
iv
of
spain
and
dating
back
to
the
years
before
when
portugal
was
a
discontented
province
of
the
hapsburg
kings
it
seems
almost
incredible
but
is
actually
a
fact
that
some
of
the
cannon
used
by
wellington
s
men
against
badajoz
were
just
two
hundred
years
old
those
that
were
not
quite
so
antique
were
mainly
pieces
of
early
pattern
without
the
later
improvements
invented
by
the
french
scientific
artillerymen
of
the
days
of
louis
xv
and
louis
xvi
for
the
lisbon
arsenal
had
persisted
in
using
old
models
long
after
they
had
been
dropped
in
the
larger
countries
of
europe
dickson
in
his
specially
mentions
this
curious
fact
and
notes
the
name
of
philip
iii
and
the
dates
on
some
of
the
guns
he
used
the
gunners
for
the
siege
were
of
course
mainly
portuguese
though
a
few
were
afterwards
drawn
from
the
imperfect
british
companies
at
lisbon
those
first
employed
were
borrowed
from
the
garrison
of
elvas
they
comprised
a
great
number
of
recruits
only
partially
trained
but
did
their
best
it
was
the
guns
not
the
men
that
were
at
fault
or
rather
both
the
guns
and
the
ammunition
for
the
portuguese
in
store
dating
from
all
ages
varied
much
in
size
and
dickson
had
to
sort
each
convoy
of
lb
or
lb
shot
into
batches
some
of
which
were
rather
small
and
some
rather
large
and
to
apportion
them
to
particular
pieces
the
old
brass
guns
being
generally
worn
from
long
use
needed
the
biggest
shot
and
even
these
were
so
large
in
the
bore
that
the
balls
fitted
loosely
and
the
discharge
suffered
from
the
impact
of
such
shot
was
not
half
what
it
should
have
been
with
such
tools
to
employ
it
is
not
wonderful
that
the
artillery
made
a
poor
show
at
the
first
siege
of
badajoz
but
worst
of
all
was
the
fact
that
the
number
of
pieces
was
at
first
far
too
small
elvas
could
only
spare
a
certain
part
of
the
armament
of
its
walls
and
it
was
not
till
some
weeks
had
passed
that
guns
british
and
portuguese
could
be
brought
up
from
lisbon
and
with
them
drafts
of
artillerymen
of
both
nations
but
guns
and
artillerymen
were
all
that
dickson
could
collect
for
the
first
siege
and
these
were
not
ready
till
april
was
out
indeed
it
was
no
small
achievement
to
organize
a
of
any
sort
between
april
and
may
from
the
sole
resources
of
the
fortress
of
elvas
of
the
additional
hindrance
caused
by
the
small
numbers
and
the
inexperience
of
the
engineer
officers
and
the
total
lack
of
trained
sappers
we
shall
speak
in
the
proper
place
these
were
the
companies
of

the
space
of
time
before
the
for
badajoz
could
be
got
ready
was
employed
by
beresford
in
clearing
southern
estremadura
of
the
enemy
having
left
a
brigade
of
the
division
at
talavera
real
a
battalion
of
the
lusitanian
legion
from
cole
s
division
in
olivenza
and
some
squadrons
of
portuguese
cavalry
round
the
southern
front
of
badajoz
to
watch
the
garrison
the
army
marched
for
santa
marta
and
zafra
on
the
to
seville
with
its
own
cavalry
in
front
and
penne
villemur
s
spanish
squadrons
on
the
left
april
the
bulk
of
the
infantry
went
no
further
forward
because
withdrew
into
the
sierra
morena
on
the
rumour
of
its
approach
the
cavalry
continued
the
pursuit
at
los
santos
on
the
its
leading
regiment
the
light
dragoons
had
a
smart
affair
with
the
french
rearguard
hussars
and
routed
it
with
the
loss
of
three
officers
and
many
men
after
this
never
stopped
till
he
had
reached
guadalcanal
on
the
borders
of
andalusia
evacuating
llerena
and
the
other
towns
on
the
estremaduran
slope
of
the
mountains
april
beresford
thereupon
left
his
british
cavalry
at
zafra
and
penne
villemur
at
llerena
to
watch
the
passes
while
he
drew
back
his
infantry
divisions
to
take
in
hand
the
siege
of
badajoz
april
with
the
exception
of
the
brigade
of
colborne
which
was
sent
out
with
some
spanish
horse
to
demonstrate
against
and
to
drive
him
still
further
southward
if
he
showed
signs
of
irresolution
long
says
that
the
took
about
prisoners
but
the
french
accounts
do
not
acknowledge
anything
like
such
loss
while
these
operations
were
in
progress
there
was
a
short
and
unexpected
diversion
in
the
extreme
corner
of
estremadura
caused
by
the
appearance
of
an
outlying
french
column
in
that
quarter
which
had
no
connexion
with
a
word
as
to
this
is
necessary
since
its
result
was
to
bring
a
new
spanish
force
into
beresford
s
sphere
of
operations
when
soult
returned
to
andalusia
in
the
middle
of
march
his
first
care
was
to
drive
off
ballasteros
and
the
other
detachments
which
had
been
threatening
seville
in
his
absence
they
gave
back
into
the
condado
de
niebla
as
has
already
been
mentioned
but
at
the
end
of
the
month
the
situation
was
complicated
by
the
news
that
an
expedition
from
cadiz
the
division
of
zayas
had
landed
at
moguer
in
the
estuary
of
the
rio
tinto
and
seemed
about
to
join
ballasteros
if
this
junction
had
been
made
the
force
collected
in
the
west
would
have
been
too
large
to
be
safely
neglected
wherefore
soult
sent
out
general
maransin
and
the
prince
of
aremberg
the
former
with
seven
battalions
of
gazan
s
division
and
the
latter
with
two
cavalry
regiments
to
attack
the
spaniards
at
the
approach
of
this
column
of
men
zayas
losing
men
from
his
rearguard
in
so
doing
april
ballasteros
retired
into
the
mountains
maransin
thought
it
his
duty
to
endeavour
to
make
an
end
of
this
active
and
elusive
adversary
whose
constant
appearances
and
reappearances
on
the
flank
of
seville
had
caused
so
much
trouble
sending
back
his
cavalry
and
guns
he
plunged
into
the
hills
with
his
infantry
and
for
twelve
days
hunted
ballasteros
up
and
down
the
rugged
upper
valleys
of
the
odiel
and
the
rio
tinto
on
april
ballasteros
gradually
pushed
northward
came
down
to
fregenal
on
the
borders
of
estremadura
where
he
offered
battle
but
was
beaten
and
fled
to
xeres
de
los
caballeros
maransin
pursued
and
reached
that
place
on
the
while
ballasteros
retired
to
salvatierra
de
los
barros
not
far
from
santa
marta
and
close
on
the
flank
of
beresford
s
army
maransin
who
had
long
been
cut
off
from
touch
with
other
french
detachments
was
wholly
unaware
that
he
had
run
into
the
neighbourhood
of
a
british
force
and
would
have
been
captured
or
defeated
if
he
had
stayed
a
day
longer
at
xeres
for
ballasteros
had
called
for
help
to
beresford
and
the
latter
was
preparing
to
throw
two
divisions
upon
his
flank
and
rear
letters
from
to
maransin
to
warn
him
of
his
danger
were
intercepted
by
the
guerrilleros
and
sent
to
the
british
camp
but
an
one
of
the
principal
inhabitants
of
xeres
warned
the
french
general
just
before
it
was
too
late
and
hastily
leaving
his
position
at
night
maransin
retired
into
andalusia
via
fregenal
and
aracena
and
ultimately
joined
by
a
circuitous
route
d
urban
visited
ballasteros
s
camp
on
the
and
settled
with
him
all
the
details
of
a
joint
march
against
maransin
whom
they
wrongly
supposed
to
be
d
aremberg
not
knowing
that
the
latter
had
returned
to
seville
with
the
cavalry
if
d
aremberg
takes
the
bait
and
follows
ballasteros
he
must
be
lost
altogether
even
if
he
halts
at
xeres
we
ought
to
get
hold
of
him
writes
d
urban
in
his
diary
but
maransin
fled
on
the
morning
of
the
d
urban
s
diary
under
the
april
ballasteros
stayed
behind
in
estremadura
and
the
allied
force
in
that
province
was
strengthened
by
his
men
but
this
was
not
all
the
regency
at
cadiz
resolved
to
place
a
considerable
army
in
this
direction
their
own
city
being
more
than
amply
garrisoned
and
expeditions
to
the
south
being
unpopular
since
the
fiasco
that
followed
barrosa
on
april
general
blake
took
the
two
divisions
of
zayas
and
lardizabal
both
of
which
had
fought
at
barrosa
and
landed
with
them
at
ayamonte
the
port
in
the
mouth
of
the
guadiana
from
thence
he
moved
up
along
the
portuguese
frontier
and
joined
ballasteros
near
xeres
de
los
caballeros
about
a
fortnight
later
between
them
they
had
over
infantry
and
about
cavalry
but
few
guns
for
blake
found
it
difficult
to
horse
the
batteries
that
he
had
brought
with
him
and
left
all
save
six
pieces
behind
at
ayamonte
to
follow
when
they
could
procure
teams
they
had
not
rejoined
him
four
weeks
later
when
the
battle
of
albuera
was
fought
the
presence
of
blake
was
not
altogether
an
unmixed
benefit
for
he
was
independent
of
castaños
who
commanded
the
army
or
old
estremaduran
force
and
the
two
generals
were
ancient
rivals
and
did
not
seem
likely
to
with
any
cordiality
but
if
soult
was
to
make
his
appearance
for
the
relief
of
badajoz
it
was
as
well
that
the
allies
should
be
as
strong
as
possible
on
the
front
by
which
he
must
attack
before
however
blake
had
arrived
in
estremadura
the
investment
of
badajoz
had
begun
it
was
directed
by
wellington
himself
who
dropped
suddenly
into
the
middle
of
the
campaign
on
the
when
he
arrived
at
elvas
having
seen
masséna
retreat
to
salamanca
and
break
up
his
army
into
cantonments
he
now
considered
that
it
was
safe
for
him
to
pay
the
visit
to
the
south
which
he
had
always
projected
leaving
sabugal
on
april
he
rode
across
country
by
castello
branco
and
niza
and
reached
elvas
on
the
fifth
night
the
next
day
but
one
he
conducted
a
reconnaissance
of
badajoz
escorted
by
a
brigade
newly
landed
at
lisbon
which
he
had
ordered
to
join
beresford
alten
s
two
light
battalions
of
the
king
s
german
legion
the
examination
of
the
defences
of
the
fortress
was
made
under
some
difficulties
for
at
the
moment
when
wellington
was
riding
round
the
walls
a
large
working
party
of
the
garrison
which
had
been
dispatched
to
cut
timber
in
the
woods
to
the
south
was
returning
into
the
place
phillipon
the
governor
thinking
that
wellington
s
escort
was
a
detachment
sent
to
cut
off
his
workmen
came
hastily
out
of
the
fortress
with
three
battalions
and
swept
off
the
two
companies
of
the
germans
who
were
accompanying
the
staff
with
the
loss
of
fifty
or
sixty
men
the
working
party
hurried
to
join
their
friends
and
got
into
the
gate
before
the
main
body
of
alten
s
brigade
could
come
up
this
interruption
being
over
wellington
completed
his
survey
of
the
whole
circuit
of
badajoz
and
on
the
next
day
april
issued
elaborate
orders
to
beresford
concerning
the
policy
to
be
observed
in
estremadura
during
the
siege
he
had
never
intended
to
stay
more
than
a
few
days
in
the
south
to
supervise
affairs
and
on
the
a
dispatch
received
from
sir
brent
spencer
the
senior
officer
left
with
the
main
army
in
the
north
reported
such
activity
of
the
french
in
that
direction
that
he
rode
hard
for
the
frontiers
of
leon
where
he
arrived
on
the
the
orders
dictated
to
beresford
governed
the
whole
course
of
the
campaign
in
estremadura
during
the
next
month
and
were
of
the
highest
importance
wellington
directed
that
the
siege
of
badajoz
should
be
begun
the
moment
that
the
guns
and
material
were
ready
but
warned
his
colleague
that
its
commencement
would
infallibly
bring
soult
to
the
relief
of
the
place
with
every
available
man
that
he
could
scrape
together
from
andalusia
it
was
impossible
to
calculate
what
the
strength
of
his
army
would
be
if
he
raised
the
siege
of
cadiz
or
evacuated
granada
so
that
he
could
bring
a
very
large
force
with
him
beresford
was
to
retire
behind
the
guadiana
and
assume
a
defensive
position
on
the
caya
river
in
front
of
elvas
if
forced
from
thence
he
must
retire
even
as
far
as
portalegre
should
it
be
necessary
but
if
soult
as
was
more
likely
came
up
with
a
force
which
was
not
absolutely
overwhelming
in
numbers
marshal
beresford
will
consider
of
and
decide
upon
the
chance
of
success
according
to
a
view
of
the
relative
number
of
both
armies
and
making
a
reasonable
allowance
for
the
number
of
spanish
troops
which
will
with
him
if
he
should
think
his
strength
sufficient
to
fight
a
general
action
to
save
the
siege
of
badajoz
he
will
collect
his
troops
to
fight
it
i
believe
that
upon
the
whole
the
most
central
and
advantageous
place
to
collect
the
troops
will
be
at
albuera
all
this
must
of
course
be
left
to
the
decision
of
sir
william
beresford
i
authorize
him
to
fight
the
action
if
he
should
think
proper
or
to
retire
if
he
should
not
vii
the
of
the
spaniards
was
the
crucial
point
unless
it
were
assured
wellington
considered
that
beresford
must
assume
the
more
cautious
and
defensive
attitude
if
it
were
secured
the
bolder
policy
might
be
pursued
the
lines
which
wellington
laid
down
were
in
the
main
those
which
had
already
been
suggested
by
beresford
castaños
must
undertake
to
keep
the
horse
of
villemur
in
the
sierra
morena
closely
observing
but
forbid
him
to
engage
in
any
fighting
he
must
retire
if
pressed
the
infantry
of
the
army
must
stay
at
merida
as
at
present
but
be
ready
to
join
beresford
if
soult
invaded
estremadura
ballasteros
was
to
take
a
similar
position
on
the
other
flank
with
his
head
quarters
at
burguillos
near
zafra
and
his
advanced
posts
at
fregenal
and
monasterio
if
soult
moved
forward
he
was
to
join
beresford
without
attempting
to
fight
when
blake
s
army
had
landed
it
was
to
pass
up
the
guadiana
and
take
post
at
xeres
de
los
caballeros
on
any
alarm
from
soult
it
was
like
the
other
spanish
troops
to
join
beresford
at
once
if
these
arrangements
worked
at
least
spaniards
would
be
in
line
at
albuera
the
chosen
position
to
assist
in
holding
back
soult
and
as
we
shall
see
the
scheme
did
work
exactly
as
wellington
had
designed
and
the
whole
force
was
collected
lastly
and
this
was
when
the
allied
forces
were
concentrated
they
must
be
placed
under
a
single
commander
and
not
worked
with
divided
authority
and
divided
responsibility
as
had
been
the
case
in
the
talavera
campaign
of
concerning
blake
there
could
be
no
difficulty
as
he
was
junior
to
castaños
and
the
latter
had
consented
to
place
himself
at
beresford
s
disposition
when
they
met
at
jerumenha
on
march
too
much
praise
can
not
be
given
to
his
reasonable
and
conciliatory
conduct
which
alone
rendered
possible
the
of
all
the
allied
forces
during
the
ensuing
campaign
not
to
be
confused
with
another
burguillos
on
the
guadalquivir
north
of
seville
wellington
therefore
as
is
clear
foresaw
the
whole
course
of
subsequent
operations
and
even
fixed
the
exact
on
which
the
fate
of
soult
s
attempt
to
relieve
badajoz
would
be
decided
the
only
point
left
to
beresford
s
decision
was
whether
the
strength
of
the
french
army
was
such
as
to
render
a
successful
resistance
possible
and
when
we
come
to
consider
the
respective
forces
at
the
disposition
of
the
two
parties
it
can
hardly
be
urged
that
beresford
was
wrong
to
accept
battle
that
his
victory
was
a
and
costly
one
came
from
minor
tactical
circumstances
which
will
be
explained
in
their
due
place
as
to
the
details
of
the
projected
siege
of
badajoz
wellington
laid
down
an
equally
clear
policy
all
guns
and
material
were
to
be
collected
in
elvas
campo
mayor
and
olivenza
and
not
to
move
till
everything
was
ready
the
main
communications
of
the
army
were
to
be
across
a
floating
bridge
to
be
constructed
at
the
junction
of
the
caya
and
the
guadiana
five
miles
below
badajoz
and
six
from
elvas
the
permanent
bridge
of
merida
and
the
temporary
bridges
at
jerumenha
would
be
subsidiary
resources
lastly
and
here
was
the
most
important
point
the
general
scheme
to
be
pursued
was
that
the
besiegers
should
first
reduce
the
outlying
defences
of
badajoz
fort
san
cristobal
on
the
north
bank
of
the
guadiana
the
pardaleras
and
the
picurina
on
the
south
bank
only
when
all
these
were
taken
would
operations
against
the
city
itself
be
begun
to
quote
the
concluding
paragraph
of
wellington
s
memorandum
when
the
british
army
shall
be
in
possession
of
san
cristobal
picurina
and
pardaleras
marshal
beresford
will
determine
upon
the
point
at
which
he
will
attack
the
body
of
the
place
it
is
believed
that
upon
the
whole
one
of
the
south
faces
will
be
the
most
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
all
the
mishaps
of
the
two
first
british
sieges
of
badajoz
had
their
origin
in
these
original
orders
of
wellington
which
were
drawn
up
on
the
advice
of
his
chief
engineer
colonel
fletcher
the
great
mistake
was
the
choosing
of
the
almost
impregnable
fort
of
san
cristobal
as
one
of
the
three
first
points
of
attack
and
the
making
all
subsequent
operations
depend
upon
its
capture
no
doubt
the
possession
of
this
lofty
and
commanding
work
would
render
the
fall
of
badajoz
certain
since
it
overlooked
the
castle
and
all
the
northern
end
of
the
city
but
it
was
the
strongest
part
of
the
whole
defences
and
when
the
miserable
and
antiquated
train
of
artillery
at
beresford
s
disposition
is
taken
into
consideration
and
it
is
remembered
that
the
siege
was
to
be
conducted
against
time
as
it
were
with
the
hope
that
it
might
be
concluded
before
soult
could
collect
a
relieving
force
it
is
clear
that
san
cristobal
ought
to
have
been
left
alone
the
other
points
designated
by
wellington
the
pardaleras
and
picurina
were
much
more
accessible
and
the
capture
of
one
or
other
of
them
would
have
brought
the
besiegers
close
to
the
walls
though
neither
of
them
commanded
the
whole
city
in
the
same
fashion
as
san
cristobal
the
best
commentary
on
the
sieges
of
is
that
a
year
later
at
the
third
and
successful
leaguer
wellington
left
the
fort
on
the
other
side
of
the
guadiana
entirely
alone
the
original
orders
of
gave
three
separate
and
distinct
objectives
and
none
of
these
were
to
be
mere
false
attacks
since
it
is
distinctly
said
that
operations
against
the
enceinte
were
only
to
begin
when
all
three
of
the
forts
were
in
british
hands
wellington
was
not
a
trained
engineer
he
was
dependent
on
the
advice
of
the
officers
of
that
arm
and
it
seems
that
they
gave
him
bad
counsel
as
they
certainly
did
to
beresford
during
the
subsequent
weeks
the
most
puzzling
thing
is
to
make
out
why
colonel
fletcher
and
his
colleagues
ignored
soult
s
precedent
the
french
engineers
had
concentrated
their
attack
on
the
pardaleras
front
as
their
sole
objective
for
their
other
operations
were
false
attacks
the
english
engineers
instead
of
concentrating
their
efforts
in
the
same
way
wasted
their
work
on
three
separate
points
which
was
all
the
more
inexcusable
because
they
knew
that
the
resources
which
their
comrades
of
the
artillery
arm
had
at
their
disposition
were
most
inadequate
for
a
great
siege
hence
came
a
very
costly
and
deplorable
series
of
failures
on
the
day
of
wellington
s
departure
from
elvas
heavy
rain
fell
and
the
guadiana
rose
high
not
merely
washing
away
the
at
jerumenha
but
rendering
the
working
of
the
flying
bridges
impossible
this
was
a
serious
matter
not
only
did
it
put
a
temporary
stop
to
the
communications
between
elvas
and
the
army
but
it
raised
the
question
as
to
what
might
happen
if
a
similar
mischance
were
to
occur
when
soult
was
invading
estremadura
for
if
the
jerumenha
bridges
should
break
when
the
allies
were
concentrated
at
albuera
they
would
have
no
line
of
retreat
and
an
impassable
river
behind
beresford
with
this
possibility
in
his
eye
ordered
an
alternative
line
of
communication
to
be
established
via
merida
and
sent
a
brigade
of
the
division
thither
to
reinforce
the
spaniards
of
morillo
and
a
day
later
the
whole
division
his
anxiety
on
this
point
did
not
cease
till
on
the
of
may
a
strong
pontoon
bridge
had
been
built
at
the
point
selected
by
wellington
the
place
where
the
caya
falls
into
the
guadiana
by
this
time
the
jerumenha
bridges
were
again
in
working
order
but
it
was
clear
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
trust
the
whole
safety
of
the
army
to
them
it
was
only
on
this
same
day
may
that
colonel
fletcher
and
major
alexander
dickson
reported
to
beresford
that
they
were
ready
to
produce
the
means
for
the
attack
on
badajoz
the
former
had
his
stock
of
platforms
fascines
and
gabions
prepared
the
latter
had
organized
the
first
convoy
of
artillery
and
ammunition
from
elvas
on
the
therefore
the
investment
of
badajoz
on
the
south
side
of
the
guadiana
was
completed
by
the
british
brigades
of
lumley
and
alten
and
the
portuguese
brigade
of
fonseca
while
on
the
following
day
the
brigade
of
kemmis
and
the
portuguese
part
of
the
garrison
of
elvas
appeared
opposite
san
cristobal
and
shut
in
the
place
on
the
northern
bank
of
the
river
the
rest
of
the
infantry
encamped
as
a
support
of
the
besieging
force
in
the
woods
between
badajoz
and
albuera
but
the
cavalry
still
remained
in
southern
estremadura
and
colborne
s
brigade
had
been
for
some
days
april
executing
a
demonstration
in
the
sierra
morena
with
the
object
of
keeping
employed
this
last
operation
owing
to
colborne
s
skilful
management
of
his
column
of
infantry
and
two
squadrons
each
of
spanish
and
portuguese
horse
had
been
very
successful
on
hearing
of
british
infantry
in
his
front
the
french
general
evacuated
his
posts
on
the
crest
of
the
mountains
guadalcanal
fuente
ovejuna
azuaga
and
monasterio
and
fell
back
towards
constantina
on
the
cordova
road
abandoning
the
direct
line
of
retreat
on
seville
which
he
had
hitherto
covered
colborne
after
clearing
all
these
places
extended
his
march
eastward
into
a
very
wild
and
unexplored
country
and
summoned
the
isolated
castle
of
benalcazar
the
only
french
garrison
left
north
of
the
sierra
morena
when
it
refused
to
listen
to
a
summons
he
had
to
leave
it
having
neither
guns
to
batter
it
nor
time
to
waste
from
thence
he
returned
by
a
circular
sweep
through
campanario
to
almendralejo
where
he
once
more
was
in
touch
with
the
british
army
may
hoghton
s
brigade
of
the
division
myers
s
and
harvey
s
brigades
of
the
division
campbell
s
brigade
of
hamilton
s
portuguese
division
the
first
episodes
of
the
siege
of
badajoz
were
not
very
encouraging
to
the
besiegers
on
the
trenches
were
opened
opposite
all
the
three
points
of
attack
designated
by
wellington
the
picurina
and
pardaleras
forts
on
the
south
side
and
san
cristobal
on
the
north
in
each
case
the
first
parallel
was
started
at
about
yards
from
the
walls
dickson
had
told
off
fourteen
and
two
howitzers
for
the
work
on
the
left
bank
five
and
two
other
howitzers
for
the
attack
on
san
cristobal
more
energy
was
displayed
in
this
last
quarter
than
in
the
others
apparently
from
the
notion
that
if
this
commanding
work
could
be
subdued
the
rest
of
the
siege
would
be
an
easy
matter
but
the
results
were
disappointing
on
the
stony
slopes
of
san
cristobal
there
was
little
earth
to
throw
up
and
the
spade
gritted
against
rock
at
three
inches
from
the
surface
at
the
end
of
the
first
night
s
digging
the
trench
was
but
a
seam
and
there
was
only
one
section
at
which
about
ten
men
could
work
under
cover
the
rest
had
to
be
abandoned
during
daylight
for
the
enemy
kept
up
a
furious
fire
not
merely
from
the
fort
but
from
the
citadel
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
whose
flank
battery
enfiladed
the
projected
trench
three
out
of
nine
engineer
officers
present
on
this
front
were
killed
or
wounded
in
the
first
hours
and
many
of
the
workers
from
kemmis
s
brigade
and
the
portuguese
it
soon
became
obvious
that
the
trenches
would
have
to
be
built
with
earth
from
a
distance
and
gabions
rather
than
excavated
nevertheless
a
battery
for
dickson
s
five
was
sketched
out
and
began
to
be
visible
to
the
enemy
on
the
night
of
the
phillipon
sent
up
a
reserve
battalion
into
san
cristobal
and
executed
a
sortie
upon
the
british
works
it
penetrated
into
the
trenches
but
was
driven
out
after
a
sharp
struggle
by
the
covering
party
but
pursuing
too
far
the
british
came
under
the
guns
of
san
cristobal
and
had
to
retire
to
their
trenches
with
lamentably
heavy
loss
next
day
the
battery
was
completed
despite
of
a
deadly
fire
both
from
the
fort
and
the
castle
and
opened
upon
its
objective
but
it
was
completely
overmastered
and
before
night
four
of
its
five
guns
had
been
damaged
or
dismounted
three
more
engineer
officers
were
hurt
leaving
only
three
surviving
of
the
original
nine
it
is
said
that
the
battery
opened
before
it
had
been
intended
a
fault
of
on
the
part
of
the
portuguese
major
in
command
beresford
s
purpose
had
been
to
wait
till
the
other
attacks
on
the
picurina
and
pardaleras
were
ready
before
beginning
to
batter
san
cristobal
these
attacks
had
met
with
less
difficulty
the
ground
being
easier
to
dig
and
on
the
evening
of
the
the
trenches
in
front
of
the
picurina
were
well
advanced
and
the
battery
of
ten
guns
there
opened
upon
the
fort
with
some
but
not
great
effect
so
d

under

the
loss
was
over
men
of
whom
were
in
the
in
the
in
the
and
in
the
portuguese
the
french
lost
about
men
only
seeing
the
san
cristobal
attack
faring
so
badly
the
engineers
got
leave
to
erect
a
second
battery
on
that
side
further
down
the
hill
which
was
intended
to
check
the
enfilading
fire
from
the
other
side
of
the
guadiana
more
guns
were
brought
up
to
the
original
battery
to
replace
those
that
had
been
damaged
but
both
batteries
were
overpowered
and
badly
maltreated
on
the
morning
of
the
a
few
hours
later

arrived
from

sent
by
ballasteros
to
the
effect

the
french
were
in
motion
from
seville

a
large
relieving
army

were
marching
hard
across
the

just
as
wellington
had
expected
they
had
reached
santa
olalla
on

were
already
in

their
force
was
estimated
at
only
men
not
far
from
the
real
amount
beresford
resolved
to
fight
and
sent
requests
to
castaños

and
blake
to
concentrate
on
albuera
the
selected
by
wellington
it
was
fortunate
that
blake
was
now
in
close
touch
and
available
he
had
reached
fregenal
on
the
and
barcarrota
on
the
so
that
his
arrival
was
certain
unless
some
unforeseen
accident
should
occur
without
his
aid
it
would
have
been
doubtful
policy
to
wait
for
soult
and
risk
a
general
action

asked

had
been

for
the
purpose
of
starting
it
when
complete
details
as
to
soult

progress
came
to

it
had
been
so
rapid
that
the
marshal
at
once
ordered
all
the
siege
operations
to
be
discontinued
though
the
engineers
tried
to
persuade
him
to
risk
two
days
more
work
by
the
vain
promise
that
they
would
undertake
to
produce

practicable
breaches

beresford
wisely
refused
to
listen

ammunition
should
be
returned
at
once
to

of

august
had
disappeared
that
the
town
within
was
still
a
mass
of
ruins
with
nearly
every
house
cut
off
sheer
at
the
first
story
was
of
no
military
importance
when
the
enceinte
and
the
were
in
good
order
there
was
a
short
moment
during
which
wellington
had
some
hopes
of
being
able
to
lay
hands
on
ciudad
rodrigo
as
well
as
almeida
he
had
learnt
that
the
spanish
fortress
was
almost
as
depleted
of
food
as
the
portuguese
and
that
masséna
s
troops
had
consumed
rations
from
its
stores
when
they
reached
the
frontier
he
thought
that
the
extra
garrison
which
junot
had
thrown
into
it
before
he
passed
onward
would
only
serve
to
exhaust
the
magazines
so
much
the
earlier
accordingly
he
not
only
requested
that
active
and
enterprising
partisan
julian
sanchez
to
beset
the
roads
between
salamanca
and
rodrigo
in
order
that
no
provisions
might
get
through
but
made
preparations
to
throw
some
british
light
troops
across
the
agueda
to
with
him
when
the
approach
of
a
convoy
should
be
reported
with
this
object
he
moved
up
the
light
division
and
arentschildt
s
brigade
of
cavalry
close
to
the
agueda
and
within
a
few
miles
of
rodrigo
their
head
quarters
were
at
gallegos
their
outposts
extended
from
the
bridge
of
barba
del
puerco
on
the
north
as
far
as
el
bodon
on
the
south
it
was
intended
that
when
don
julian
signalled
the
approach
of
the
french
the
light
division
should
make
a
dash
across
the
fords
of
the
agueda
and
endeavour
to
intercept
the
convoy
this
plan
failed
on
the
of
april
owing
as
wellington
held
to
the
slowness
of
sir
william
erskine
who
was
still
in
command
of
the
division
though
news
had
just
arrived
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
all
the
battalions
that
its
old
general
craufurd
was
daily
expected
at
lisbon
on
his
way
to
the
front
wellington
to
beresford
april
sir
william
erskine
did
not
send
a
detachment
across
the
agueda
in
time
as
i
had
desired
him
and
the
consequence
is
that
the
french
got
their
convoy
into
ciudad
rodrigo
yesterday
morning
it
is
useless
now
to
keep
anybody
on
the
other
side
of
the
vii
rodrigo
having
been
revictualled
wellington
abandoned
all
hope
of
molesting
it
further
to
have
invested
it
would
have
been
useless
when
he
had
no
but
almeida
he
intended
to
reduce
at
his
leisure
being
of
the
opinion
that
it
would
be
starved
out
before
masséna
was
in
a
position
to
take
the
field
to
relieve
it
nothing
short
of
his
whole
army
would
suffice
for
that
operation
if
that
even
were
enough
and
knowing
that
the
troops
had
just
reached
salamanca
in
a
demoralized
and
discontented
condition
without
shoes
without
train
almost
without
ammunition
and
with
the
remnant
of
their
cavalry
and
artillery
horses
dying
off
at
the
rate
of
several
hundreds
a
day
wellington
doubted
if
his
adversary
would
be
able
to
come
out
of
his
cantonments
before
the
summer
was
far
spent
at
any
rate
he
calculated
that
he
had
a
good
many
weeks
before
him
in
which
he
was
not
likely
to
find
the
army
of
portugal
a
serious
danger
accordingly
he
resolved
to
put
his
own
host
into
cantonments
also
in
such
a
position
as
to
block
the
road
to
almeida
and
to
give
it
a
rest
while
that
fortress
was
being
starved
out
he
had
as
we
observed
in
a
previous
chapter
no
intention
of
assuming
the
offensive
against
the
french
in
leon
till
he
had
organized
his
line
of
communication
with
his
new
base
at
coimbra
and
established
large
intermediate
dépôts
at
lamego
celorico
and
other
conveniently
placed
localities
the
army
was
living
from
hand
to
mouth
all
the
country
about
almeida
guarda
and
sabugal
having
been
thoroughly
devastated
on
convoys
which
were
only
struggling
up
at
irregular
intervals
from
the
lower
mondego
the
horses
especially
were
in
very
poor
order
from
want
of
proper
forage
the
regiments
subsisted
on
the
green
corn
which
was
dreadful
to
the
inhabitants
and
of
little
use
to
the
horses
when
they
had
to
work
there
was
nothing
else
and
we
had
to
cut
their
rye
how
our
army
has
been
carried
though
this
desolate
abandoned
country
is
astonishing
till
there
were
dépôts
and
a
regular
service
established
it
was
impossible
to
concentrate
the
army
much
less
to
send
it
forward
into
spain

accordingly
the
allied
troops
were
spread
broadcast
in
the
villages
between
the
coa
and
the
agueda
the
light
division
and
two
cavalry
regiments
were
in
front
holding
the
outposts
facing
ciudad
rodrigo
and
in
touch
with
drouet
s
corps
which
lay
along
the

a
stream
that
runs
roughly
parallel
with
the
agueda

a
distance
of
from
seven
to
fifteen
miles

they
had

were
cantoned
in

being
distributed
between

places
in

the
cavalry
save

was
trying
to
keep
its
horses
alive
in
the
poor
villages
along
the
coa
from
castello
rodrigo
to
alfayates
the
whole
army
distributed
in
a
square
of
not
more
than
twenty
miles
was
so
placed
that
it
could
concentrate
at
any
point
in
one
march
wellington
even
though
he
judged
masséna
unable
to
molest
him
was
determined
not
to
be
caught
with
his
troops
in
a
state
of
dispersion

but
considering
that
things
were
at
present
at
a
standstill
on
the
northern
frontier
and
that
nothing
serious
could
be
undertaken
there
till
the
line
of
supplies
was
organized
and
almeida
captured
wellington
now
resolved
to
pay
the
visit
to
estremadura
which
he
projected
as
far
back
as
the
commencement
of
masséna
s
retreat
at
this
moment
he
wrote
to
lord
liverpool
the
first
object
is
certainly
till
that
place
should
have
been
recovered
and
regarrisoned
he
could
never
feel
quite
safe
on
his
southern
flank
a
diversion
on
the
part
of
soult
in
the
alemtejo
threatening
lisbon
from
the
south
would
always
be
a
dangerous
and
tiresome
possibility
until
badajoz
was
once
more
in
the
hands
of
the
allies
and
all
estremadura
recovered
and
held
by
a
competent
force
the
future
was
inscrutable
for
all
wellington
knew
the
emperor
might
appear
in
person
before
the
summer
was
over
to
take
up
the
spanish
problem
or
on
the
other
hand
the
affairs
of
eastern
europe
might
cause
him
to
shut
off
all
reinforcements
from
the
peninsula
and
to
turn
his
attention
to
a
russian
war
but
whatever
might
happen
it
was
well
to
have
the
portuguese
frontier
properly
covered
in
the
south
supposing
the
french
made
another
march
on
lisbon
it
was
necessary
to
be
free
of
danger
in
the
rear
supposing
that
they
showed
weakness
and
dropped
the
offensive
the
possession
of
badajoz
and
estremadura
gave
facilities
for
disquieting
the
army
of
andalusia
perhaps
for
raising
the
siege
of
cadiz
which
could
not
be
secured
in
any
other
fashion
meanwhile
wellington
formulated
three
possible
courses
which
the
french
might
pursue
during
the
next
two
months
before
new
reinforcements
could
reach
them
from
france
or
the
emperor
make
his
appearance
if
so
he
should
decide
to
do
these
three
possible
courses
were
masséna
might
call
on
bessières
and
induce
him
to
join
the
army
of
portugal
at
once
with
all
his
disposable
troops
in
order
that
they
might
save
almeida
by
driving
off
the
british
army
masséna
might
allow
his
troops
a
long
repose
in
cantonments
relieving
the
army
of
the
north
in
its
present
charge
of
old
castile
while
bessières
with
such
part
of
his
corps
as
he
could
collect
might
invade
galicia
to
clear
the
french
right
flank
masséna
might
give
his
troops
the
repose
that
they
needed
and
after
some
interval
might
pass
south
into
estremadura
to
join
soult
in
operations
on
the
guadiana
while
leaving
bessières
in
charge
of
the
defence
of
the
frontiers
of
leon
it
will
be
seen
that
the
french
actually
adopted
first
plan
the
endeavour
to
save
almeida
by
a
junction
of
the
armies
of
portugal
and
the
north
and
then
a
month
later
plan
a
concentration
in
estremadura
to
save
badajoz
oddly
enough
wellington
conceived
that
the
first
plan
was
the
least
likely
of
the
three
apparently
because
he
the
time
which
it
would
take
masséna
to
reorganize
his
army
and
resume
active
operations
he
did
not
make
enough
allowance
for
the
old
marshal
s
obstinacy
and
for
the
pride
which
forbade
him
to
allow
almeida
to
fall
without
any
effort
being
made
to
relieve
it
but
though
he
thought
this
scheme
the
least
likely
for
the
french
to
adopt
he
made
full
provisions
for
dealing
with
it
in
case
it
should
be
the
one
they
selected
his
second
suggestion
that
bessières
might
hand
over
the
charge
of
old
castile
to
masséna
and
proceed
to
invade
galicia
was
founded
on
an
insufficient
knowledge
of
the
present
situation
and
difficulties
of
the
army
of
the
north
bessières
though
the
gross
amount
of
his
forces
was
large
over
men
was
much
too
obsessed
and
worried
by
the
guerrilleros
to
dream
of
concentrating
a
force
large
enough
to
make
a
serious
invasion
of
galicia
we
shall
find
him
three
weeks
after
the
date
of
wellington
s
dispatch
declaring
that
he
could
only
collect
cavalry
and
one
battery
to
form
a
field
force
because
any
movement
of
his
infantry
would
imperil
the
whole
fabric
of
the
french
supremacy
in
northern
spain
if
the
objection
be
raised
that
this
plea
of
his
was
only
put
forth
in
order
to
disoblige
masséna
and
to
save
himself
from
responsibility
no
such
objection
can
be
made
to
his
statement
of
june
made
after
masséna
s
recall
to
the
effect
that
if
he
were
forced
to
concentrate
men
for
any
purpose
all
communications
with
france
and
madrid
would
be
lost
and
the
whole
of
the
from
the
guadiana
to
the
bay
of
biscay
would
blaze
up
in
one
general
insurrection
supposing
that
masséna
and
bessières
had
been
on
the
best
of
terms
and
that
the
former
had
proposed
to
take
over
the
charge
of
the
region
occupied
by
the
latter
in
order
to
set
the
army
of
the
north
free
for
field
operations
bessières
must
have
replied
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
produce
enough
men
to
contain
the
british
army
and
at
the
same
time
to
attack
galicia
wellington
s
hypothesis
therefore
was
faulty
he
undervalued
the
work
of
the
guerrilleros
who
were
occupying
for
his
benefit
the
attention
of
a
much
greater
part
of
the
french
army
than
he
supposed
the
idea
that
the
enemy
might
make
a
blow
at
galicia
was
inspired
by
his
knowledge
of
the
weakness
of
that
province
where
mahy
had
put
everything
out
of
gear
and
santocildes
had
not
yet
begun
the
process
of
reorganization
knowing
how
disastrous
the
appearance
of
a
french
corps
in
this
quarter
might
prove
he
feared
it
more
than
was
necessary
the
very
interesting
dispatch
in
which
wellington
s
forecast
is
stated
is
that
to
castaños
of
april
written
in
french
en
pensant
à
ce
qu
ils
doivent
faire
dans
leurs
circonstances
actuelles
je
trouve
que
ou
ils
feront
l
invasion
de
la
galice
avec
le
corps
de
bessières
pendant
que
masséna
donnera
du
repos
à
ses
troupes
dans
les
cantonnements
occupés
jusqu
à
présent
par
bessières
ou
ils
se
joindront
pour
tomber
sur

corps

qui
n
est
pas
très
vraisemblable
ou
ils
ne
feront
rien
jusqu
à
ce
que

et
remises
en
état
quand
ils
rassembleront
une
grande
armée
dans
l
vii
bessières
to
berthier
from
valladolid
june
it
is
possible
that
there
is
some
diplomatic
intention
in
the
stress
laid
by
wellington
on
the
likelihood
of
a
french
invasion
of
galicia
he
was
writing
to
castaños
and
it
was
his
object
to
get
that
general
to
stir
up
the
galicians
hence
perhaps
he
exaggerated
a
possibility
which
was
not
so
strong
as
he
stated
if
it
be
asked
what
were
napoleon
s
views
as
to
the
proper
scheme
for
the
french
marshals
to
adopt
under
the
circumstances
that
existed
on
april
we
must
not
look
of
course
to
orders
issued
about
that
time
when
he
was
still
working
on
data
three
weeks
old
as
late
as
march
he
had
been
sending
instructions
to
soult
and
other
commanders
on
the
hypothesis
that
masséna
s
head
quarters
were
at
coimbra
and
that
oporto
was
very
possibly
in
french
hands
on
april
he
was
telling
the
prince
of
essling
to
devote
his
energy
to
the
armament
of
almeida
and
to
place
himself
so
as
to
cover
both
that
place
and
ciudad
rodrigo
orders
exquisitely
inapplicable
when
almeida
was
already
blockaded
by
wellington
and
masséna
s
troops
had
just
crawled
past
ciudad
rodrigo
in
a
state
of
hopeless
dilapidation
on
their
retreat
to
salamanca
the
next
advice
sent
to
the
army
of
portugal
was
almost
equally
inappropriate
having
heard
of
wellington
s
flying
visit
to
estremadura
by
intelligence
dated
april
the
trip
had
begun
upon
the
he
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
the
english
general
must
have
taken
many
troops
with
him
on
may
he
wrote
the
translations
from
english
newspapers
herewith
enclosed
show
that
lord
wellington
had
crossed
the
tagus
on
april
so
it
seems
that
on
the
side
of
castile
there
can
now
be
only
half
the
english
army
left
the
events
which
must
already
have
taken
place
on
the
side
of
almeida
will
have
shown
the
generals
that
this
is
the
case
and
will
have
enabled
them
to
make
the
proper
corresponding
move
prendre
le
parti
viz
to
begin
to
move
towards
the
tagus
on
the
day
when

was

by

days

he
was
to
replace
ney
at
the
head
of
the
corps
whether
the
emperor
had
already
made
up
his
mind
on
the
that
marmont
was
to
replace
masséna
not
to
serve
under
him
it
is
impossible
to
say
but
he
at
any
rate
concealed
his
purpose
from
the
younger
marshal
who
had
been
some
days
in
spain
before
he
received
on
may
the
dispatch
of
april
which
made
him
commander
of
the
army
of
portugal
probably
the
news
that
masséna
had
failed
in
his
design
to
hold
coimbra
which
foy
had
elaborately
explained
to
the
emperor
and
had
fallen
back
behind
ciudad
rodrigo
had
provoked
his
master
to
dismiss
him
from
command
foy
s
report
had
caused
napoleon
to
believe
that
masséna
could
stop
on
the
mondego
and
hold
wellington
in
check
the
imperial
dispatch
of
march
as
we
have
already
seen
speaks
of
masséna
s
stay
at
coimbra
as
a
settled
fact
and
states
that
oporto
is
or
will
soon
be
in
his
hands
on
april
napoleon
knew
that
the
marshal
had
lost
coimbra
and
fallen
back
on
guarda
but
continued
to
send
him
elaborate
instructions
it
was
apparently
the
receipt
of
masséna
s
dispatch
of
march
from
alfayates
confessing
that
he
was
completely
foiled
and
that
he
must
retire
beyond
the
agueda
as
far
as
zamora
and
toro
since
the
spirit
of
the
army
was
so
broken
that
he
dared
not
risk
a
general
action
which
determined
the
emperor
to
supersede
him
this
document
must
have
reached
paris
about
the
or
and
would
suffice
to
explain
napoleon
s
anger
for
a
who
confesses
that
he
has
lost
the
confidence
of
his
army
is
a
dangerous
person
to
retain
in
power
there
was
ample
evidence
from
masséna
s
earlier
letters
that
he
had
quarrelled
not
only
with
ney
but
with
most
of
his
other
superior
officers
if
the
general
feeling
of
the
army
was
also
against
him
he
was
not
likely
to
get
much
good
service
out
of
it
possibly
there
may
have
been
also
a
feeling
of
wounded
in
the
emperor
s
breast
when
he
reflected
how
relying
on
masséna
s
assurances
he
had
informed
soult
king
joseph
and
bessières
that
the
army
of
portugal
had
its
head
quarters
at
coimbra
and
would
attack
lisbon
in
the
autumn
so
that
a
hundred
thousand
men
using
coimbra
and
badajoz
as
their
bases
would
complete
the
conquest
of
portugal
a
conquest
which
would
drag
england
into
a
crisis
that
would
be
of
the
highest
napoleon
did
not
like
to
be
made
ridiculous
before
his
subordinates
by
having
been
induced
to
publish
an
absurd
misstatement
of
fact
leading
up
to
a
vainglorious
prophecy
which
appeared
most
unlikely
to
be
realized
this
we
learn
from
marmont
s
letter
to
berthier
dated
may
in
which
he
says
that
the
dispatch
reached
him
only
on
may
and
that
its
contents
were
unexpected

all
this
of
course
is
from
the
great
memorandum
of
march
which
berthier
was
to
communicate
to
all
the
chiefs
of
the
peninsular
armies
but
though
masséna
s
as
was
signed
on
april
and
may
have
been
decided
upon
as
early
as
april
there
were
still
three
weeks
during
which
he
was
to
make
his
last
stroke
for
revenge
and
to
lose
his
last
battle
for
it
was
not
till
may
that
marmont
presented
his
de
and
took
over
the
command
wellington
meanwhile
convinced
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
for
some
little
time
from
the
army
of
portugal
and
its
commander
left
villar
formoso
on
the
morning
of
april
reached
sabugal
that
night
castello
branco
on
the
and
elvas
by
the
noon
of
the
this
was
marvellous
travelling
considering
the
mountain
roads
that
had
to
be
traversed
but
wellington
was
a
mighty
horseman
and
accompanied
by
only
a
few
staff
officers
flew
like
the
wind
over
hill
and
dale
he
remained
only
four
days
in
estremadura
during
that
short
time
he
surveyed
badajoz
and
issued
compendious
directions
for
the
siege
he
drew
up
a
plan
of
campaign
for
the
united
armies
of
beresford
blake
and
castaños
and
then
returning
as
rapidly
as
he
had
come
retraced
his
route
to
the
frontiers
of
leon
and
was
back
at
alameda
on
the
having
been
less
than
a
fortnight
absent
from
his
army
this
rapidity
of
movement
as
we
have
already
seen
completely
puzzled
napoleon
who
on
receiving
the
intelligence
that
wellington
was
over
the
tagus
on
the
thought
that
he
had
gone
with
a
strong
force
to
establish
himself
in
estremadura
and
sent
orders
for
the
army
of
portugal
to
move
at
once
towards
the
south
a
movement
which
at
that
moment
could
not
have
been
executed
for
want
of
train
transport
and
provisions
for
all
this
see
section
xxvi
pp
on
beresford
s
campaign
in
estremadura
see
above
during
wellington
s
absence
the
command
of
the
troops
cantoned
between
the
agueda
and
the
coa
had
been
given
over
to
sir
brent
spencer
as
the
senior
present
wellington
did
not
think
it
probable
that
spencer
would
be
much
troubled
by
the
enemy
during
his
short
spell
of
responsibility
but
left
him
directions
that
covered
every
possible
contingency
if
contrary
to
all
expectation
masséna
should
make
an
effort
to
relieve
almeida
within
the
fortnight
for
which
the
intended
to
be
absent
spencer
was
directed
to
make
a
careful
estimate
of
the
force
of
the
enemy
if
it
were
but
small
the
line
of
the
agueda
might
be
held
if
it
were
great
it
was
conceivable
that
bessières
might
succour
masséna
spencer
was
to
concentrate
not
in
front
of
almeida
nor
across
the
road
from
rodrigo
to
that
place
but
in
a
defensive
position
to
the
south
of
it
parallel
to
the
french
line
of
advance
and
threatening
it
in
flank
only
pack
s
portuguese
infantry
brigade
and
barbaçena
s
cavalry
brigade
of
the
same
nation
were
to
keep
up
the
investment
of
almeida
till
the
last
possible
moment
the
designated
position
was
that
in
front
of
rendo
alfayates
and
aldea
velha
which
wellington
took
up
himself
later
in
the
same
year
during
a
subsequent
movement
of
the
french
to
relieve
ciudad
rodrigo
no
leave
to
fight
a
battle
was
given
to
spencer
though
it
was
given
to
beresford
when
the
latter
was
placed
in
a
similar
responsible
position
instead
he
was
ordered
to
send
constant
information
to
his
absent
chief
who
gave
him
a
tabular
statement
of
the
mileage
of
his
journey
and
the
place
at
which
he
was
to
be
heard
of
each
day
wellington
intended
to
return
with
his
own
peculiar
swiftness
on
the
first
threatening
news
and
thought
that
he
could
reckon
on
being
back
in
time
if
he
was
properly
advised
of
the
first
ominous
movements
of
the
enemy
he
apparently
calculated
that
if
masséna
came
on
in
great
force
and
found
the
british
army
massed
in
a
strong
mountain
position
upon
the
flank
of
the
route
that
he
must
take
towards
almeida
he
would
be
unlikely
to
attack
it
bussaco
being
an
unpleasant
memory
if
the
marshal
began
to
manœuvre
he
would
lose
time
and
he
himself
would
be
back
before
the
crisis
came
that
he
did
not
purpose
to
be
longer
away
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
he
was
already
at
portalegre
on
his
return
journey
from
elvas
when
spencer
s
final
warning
that
masséna
was
on
the
move
reached
him
vii
see
the
three
dispatches
to
spencer
on
pp
and
of
vii
dated
respectively
april
april
and
april
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
only
towards
the
end
of
spencer
s
short
period
of
responsibility
that
matters
began
to
grow
interesting
upon
the
frontiers
of
leon
there
was
however
a
slight
alarm
on
the
just
after
wellington
s
departure
masséna
not
contented
with
having
passed
a
first
convoy
into
rodrigo
on
the
had
followed
it
up
with
a
second
which
was
escorted
by
marchand
s
division
of
the
corps
a
unit
which
had
seen
more
severe
service
during
march
than
any
other
part
of
the
french
army
yet
was
considered
to
be
in
better
order
than
its
fellows
the
same
phenomenon
it
will
be
remembered
had
been
noted
with
paget
s
rearguard
division
during
moore
s
retreat
to
corunna
marchand
was
ordered
when
he
should
have
lodged
the
convoy
in
rodrigo
to
make
a
reconnaissance
toward
the
azava
and
try
to
discover
what
was
the
force
of
the
british
in
that
direction
he
got
into
the
fortress
without
hindrance
owing
to
erskine
s
usual
talent
for
bungling
on
the
approach
of
the
convoy
the
light
division
was
concentrated
at
molino
de
flores
but
erskine
refused
to
send
it
over
the
fords
and
watched
marchand
defile
into
the
town
some
cavalry
went
across
the
agueda
and
cut
off
a
flanking
party
of
three
hundred
french
who
took
shelter
in
a
ruined
village
and
refused
to
surrender
erskine
sent
no
one
to
support
the
british
horse
and
presently
a
french
column
came
out
of
rodrigo
and
released
the
blockaded
party
all
this
took
place
under
the
eyes
of
the
disgusted
light
division
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
april
for
details
see
the
of
george
simmons
of
the
british
pp
some
days
later
marchand
came
out
of
rodrigo
with
a
regiment
of
infantry
and
a
squadron
to
make
the
reconnaissance
which
he
had
been
directed
to
execute
at
marialva
five
miles
outside
the
fortress
he
ran
into
the
pickets
of
the
and
and
received
such
a
warm
reception
that
he
turned
back
at
once
and
sent
the
report
to
masséna
that
the
british
were
established
in
strong
force
close
above
the
agueda
april
after
this
there
were
no
further
alarms
at
the
front
till
the
the
day
on
which
wellington
returned
from
elvas
but
spencer
s
account
of
the
reconnaissance
of
the
which
reached
wellington
at
portalegre
on
the
undoubtedly
contributed
to
hurry
the
return
journey
of
the
for
it
was
accompanied
by
a
report
which
was
perfectly
correct
that
information
from
the
side
of
salamanca
seemed
to
make
it
certain
that
masséna
was
reconcentrating
his
troops
for
a
dash
at
almeida
and
that
bessières
had
been
asked
to
give
help
the
salamanca
secret
correspondents
of
whom
the
chief
was
doctor
curtis
the
head
of
the
irish
college
in
the
university
had
always
proved
trustworthy
so
that
their
reports
could
not
be
ignored
and
wellington
was
glad
that
the
french
movement
was
reported
at
the
end
and
not
at
the
commencement
of
his
trip
to
estremadura
wrongly
dated
april
by
sprünglin
in
his
generally
accurate
diary
the
fact
was
that
masséna
was
making
a
last
desperate
effort
to
save
the
military
reputation
of
which
he
was
so
proud
and
to
justify
himself
to
his
master
if
almeida
and
rodrigo
were
both
to
be
lost
as
the
final
sequel
to
his
retreat
from
portugal
his
whole
year
s
command
must
be
written
down
as
a
failure
if
these
early
conquests
of
could
be
saved
he
might
yet
claim
to
have
added
somewhat
to
the
french
dominions
in
the
peninsula
his
troops
had
not
been
a
fortnight
in
their
cantonments
before
he
was
making
preparations
to
reassemble
them
for
a
last
effort
in
some
respects
that
fortnight
had
made
a
great
difference
in
their
condition
salamanca
and
valladolid
at
the
moment
of
his
arrival
were
full
of
drafts
of
men
and
accumulation
of
stores
belonging
to
the
army
of
portugal
which
had
been
gathering
there
for
many
months
while
the
communications
with
that
army
were
cut
at
one
moment
in
the
late
winter
thiébault
the
governor
of
salamanca
had
no
less
than
men
of
detachments
belonging
to
masséna
s
troops
in
his
government
partly
convalescents
partly
small
parties
which
had
come
up
from
the
french
dépôts
to
join
their
regiments
and
had
been
unable
to
do
so
though
some
of
them
had
ultimately
gone
forward
with
foy
and
gardanne
many
still
remained
to
be
absorbed
the
numbers
of
present
under
arms
in
the
and
corps
went
up
at
once
the
mass
of
sick
and
exhausted
men
which
they
discharged
into
hospital
being
replaced
by
the
drafts
and
convalescents
masséna
also
took
out
of
the
corps
the
battalions
belonging
to
regiments
of
which
the
main
bodies
were
already
in
the
old
army
of
portugal
and
sent
them
to
join
their
comrades
the
of
one
battalion
in
each
regiment
were
then
sent
home
to
france
and
the
other
three
raised
to
something
like
their
original
war
strength
this
redistribution
brought
up
the
divisions
of
reynier
and
loison
to
a
figure
which
they
had
not
known
for
many
months
though
it
depleted
drouet
s
corps
to
a
corresponding
extent
his
troops
now
consisted
of
only
eighteen
battalions
or
infantry
all
consisting
of
fourth
battalions
belonging
to
regiments
serving
in
andalusia
he
had
received
orders
that
when
the
crisis
on
the
frontiers
of
leon
was
over
he
was
to
conduct
these
units
to
join
their
eagles
in
soult
s
army
drouet
was
anxious
to
get
away
from
masséna
as
soon
as
possible
and
would
gladly
have
marched
for
seville
without
delay
but
it
was
obvious
that
this
was
as
yet
impossible
and
as
he
was
technically
under
the
command
of
the
marshal
he
was
compelled
to
play
his
part
in
the
ensuing
campaign

p
the
net
result
of
all
the
transferences
of

the
picking
up
of

that

masséna
left
it
behind
when
he
mobilized
the
other
divisions
of
the
old
army

for
the
may
campaign
but
the
men
available
for
the
field
in
the
remaining
divisions

those

amounted
to
bayonets
their
ammunition
had
been
replenished
they
had
been
reshod

only
to
a
small

reclothed

they

much
to
be
desired

ney
was
still
regretted
but
a
french
army
however
discontented
could
always
be
trusted
to
fight
when
duty
called
and
the
prince
of
essling
still
hoped
to
redeem
his
lost
reputation
it
had
sunk
on
may
from
an
original
strength
of

to

the
weak
points
in

only
reached
the

to
die
a

back
came
to
the
front
with
the
most
effective
cavalry
unit
in
the
army
was
the
brigade
of
fournier
belonging
to
drouet
s
corps
which
not
having
shared
in
the
winter
campaign
in
portugal
could
show
men
in
good
state
thus
masséna
could
bring
forward
for
the
new
campaign
no
more
than
horsemen
and
these
not
in
the
best
condition
for
strange
doings
of
this
eccentric
brigadier
at
salamanca
during
the
winter
see
thiébault
vol
iv
pp
these
figures
differing
much
from
those
supplied
by
koch
are
worked
out
from
the
return
of
may
in
the
paris
archives
nationales
the
total
of
cavalry
mounted
and
available
seems
to
have
been
including
fournier
see
tables
in
appendix
xix
with
the
artillery
the
case
was
even
worse
for
the
class
of
horse
had
been
weaker
and
the
mortality
proportionately
greater
as
we
have
seen
in
a
previous
chapter
the
batteries
had
for
the
most
part
just
succeeded
in
dragging
back
their
guns
to
the
agueda
after
destroying
nearly
all
their
carts
and
caissons
it
was
doubtful
whether
for
an
offensive
campaign
the
whole
army
could
now
provide
twenty
guns
with
the
full
complement
of
auxiliary
vehicles
adequately
horsed
masséna
in
stating
his
difficulties
to
berthier
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
each
of
the
four
corps
could
put
about
half
a
battery
into
the
field
in
proper
order
the
state
of
the
military
train
was
quite
as
bad
regimental
and
corps
transport
was
reduced
to
such
a
state
of
nullity
that
when
the
army
took
the
field
it
would
have
to
be
for
a
few
days
at
most
since
after
loading
the
men
with
as
many
rations
as
each
could
carry
the
only
extra
supply
was
what
could
be
drawn
by
a
few
store
carts
found
in
rodrigo
and
salamanca
during
the
short
campaign
that
was
imminent
the
troops
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
on
food
daily
brought
up
from
the
magazines
of
rodrigo
after
having
been
compelled
to
eat
the
convoy
that
they
had
brought
with
them
for
the
supply
of
almeida
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
from
the
which
was
exhausted
by
the
constant
passing
to
and
fro
of
armies
and
detachments
all
the
way
from
salamanca
to
the
frontier
masséna
to
berthier
april
from
ciudad
rodrigo
the
returns
show
that
on
may
twelve
batteries
had
been
left
behind
with
no
horses
at
all
in
order
that
the
five
remaining
might
take
the
field
with
horses
food
at
the
base
existed
when
masséna
reached
salamanca
he
had
found
there
considerable
accumulations
though
not
nearly
so
much
as
he
expected
or
required
it
was
on
this
particular
point
that
he
had
started
a
lively
dispute
with
bessières
the
moment
that
he
reached
spain
the
duke
of
istria
had
been
for
some
months
in
charge
of
the
whole
of
old
castile
and
leon
and
had
come
to
look
upon
their
resources
as
so
much
his
own
private
property
that
he
greatly
resented
the
intrusion
of
starving
men
into
his
governorship
masséna
complained
that
he
was
fed
with
promises
and
that
when
statistics
of
food
placed
at
his
disposal
were
compared
with
what
was
actually
handed
over
there
was
a
lamentable
discrepancy
he
had
been
told
that
he
would
find
at
salamanca
of
wheat
and
that
more
and
rations
of
biscuit
for
the
garrison
of
rodrigo
would
appear
in
a
few
days
he
stated
that
he
could
only
discover
and
rations
of
biscuit
and
that
the
convoy
sent
to
rodrigo
on
the
had
only
carried
rations
at
most
bessières
replied
that
he
was
doing
his
best
that
he
had
his
own
corps
to
feed
that
the
arrival
of
the
army
of
portugal
was
wholly
unexpected
had
he
not
been
told
only
a
few
weeks
back
first
that
it
was
to
stay
at
coimbra
and
then
that
it
was
going
off
by
a
cross
march
to
plasencia
and
the
tagus
for
so
masséna
had
written
from
guarda
at
the
end
of
march
moreover
old
castile
was
dreadfully
exhausted
and
the
guerrilleros
so
active
that
every
convoy
required
an
immense
escort
to
guard
it
all
this
was
perfectly
true
yet
it
is
probable
that
he
might
have
done
more
if
he
had
chosen
and
he
presently
received
virulent
rebukes
from
the
emperor
for
lack
of
zeal
masséna
to
berthier
april
from
salamanca
but
when
recriminatory
letters
were
already
passing
between
the
two
marshals
on
the
food
question
bessières
began
to
receive
additional
demands
for
military
help
on
april
masséna
wrote
that
he
was
bound
in
honour
to
march
to
the
relief
of
almeida
that
he
would
have
his
infantry
reorganized
by
the
but
that
his
cavalry
and
artillery
were
in
such
a
hopeless
state
that
he
was
forced
to
make
a
formal
request
for
aid
to
the
army
of
the
north
the
duke
of
istria
replied
that
his
troops
were
so
scattered
and
the
guerrilleros
so
active
that
he
doubted
if
he
could
give
any
help
at
all
on
the
however
he
wrote
that
by
making
a
great
effort
he
could
collect
some
cavalry
and
guns
and
would
be
at
salamanca
on
the
but
on
the
nothing
had
arrived
from
the
army
of
the
north
at
that
city
masséna
replied
in
high
wrath
vos

sont
inconcevables
je
vous
ai
demandé
de

de

et
d
almeida
bessières
however
did
not
break
his
promise
as
masséna
had
for
a
moment
feared
he
merely
executed
it
a
little
late
and
on
the
smallest
possible
scale
he
brought
with
him
two
small
brigades
of
cavalry
making
between
and
sabres
that
of
wathier
à
and
hussars
and
that
of
lepic
which
consisted
of
two
squadrons
each
of
the
grenadiers
lancers
and
chasseurs
of
the
imperial
guard
he
had
also
a
horse
artillery
battery
of
the
guard
and
had
brought
thirty
teams
of
which
when
distributed
to
the
army
of
portugal
enabled
it
to
put
pieces
and
the
corresponding
caissons
in
the
field
masséna
had
asked
for
bessières
s
cavalry
and
guns
but
had
not
been
at
all
anxious
to
see
his
colleague
in
person
appearing
he
would
have
done
better
said
the
prince
to
his
staff
to
have
sent
me
a
few
thousand
men
more
and
more
food
and
ammunition
and
to
have
stopped
at
his
own
head
quarters
instead
of
coming
here
to
examine
and
criticize
all
my
movements
he
got
a
cool
reception
which
did
not
prevent
him
from
following
masséna
about
during
the
whole
campaign
volunteering
frequent
advice
and
expressing
a
polite
curiosity
at
his
colleague
s
smallest
actions
apparently
he
wanted
to
have
credit
for
being
present
at
a
victory
if
one
should
occur
but
was
anxious
to
risk
as
few
of
his
own
troops
as
possible
and
not
to
take
any
responsibility
the
emperor
three
weeks
later
wrote
him
a
letter
of
bitter
rebuke
saying
that
he
could
well
have
brought
up
men
without
disgarnishing
any
important
posts
an
infantry
division
of
the
guard
and
four
batteries
might
have
been
added
to
the
horse
that
he
actually
produced
without
leaving
valladolid
burgos
or
the
frontier
opposite
galicia
in
any
danger
if
the
two
marshals
had
collected
some
men
it
is
certain
that
wellington
would
not
have
fought
and
would
have
allowed
almeida
to
be
revictualled
so
marbot
ii
if
marbot
s
talents
as
a
make
his
authority
doubtful
we
may
point
out
that
thiébault
the
governor
of
salamanca
tells
much
the
same
story
in
his
iv
berthier
to
bessières
may
masséna
had
reached
ciudad
rodrigo
on
april
his
four
corps
concentrated
there
by
the
and
bessières
came
up
with
his
cavalry
on
the
of
may
the
whole
force
assembled
consisted
of
infantry
cavalry
and

a
total
counting
the
auxiliary
arms
of
about
men
on
the
marchand
was
sent
out
with
six
squadrons
and
his
own
infantry
to
make
a
reconnaissance
in
force
of
the
allied
lines
he
found
the
light
division
still
in
position
at
gallegos
with
outposts
along
the
azava
and
withdrew
to
rodrigo
after
having
stayed
for
some
hours
opposite
the
height
of
marialva
on
the
next
day
but
one
may
the
french
army
began
to
pour
in
an
interminable
stream
across
the
agueda
by
the
bridge
of
ciudad
rodrigo
dividing
into
two
columns
when
it
had
passed
the

we
shall

at
about
if
wellington
had
possessed
men
fuentes
de
oñoro
would
have
been
a
very
different
sort
of
battle
wellington
was
perfectly
well
prepared
to
meet
the
movement
he
had
been
back
with
his
army
since
the
of
april
and
had
been
informed
on
his
arrival
that
masséna
had
come
to
ciudad
rodrigo
in
person
two
days
before
and
that
the
roads
from
salamanca
westward
were
black
with
french
columns
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
fight
though
he
had
denied
spencer
the
power
to
do
so
in
his
absence
the
battle
position
was
already
chosen
and
the
army
was
concentrated
upon
it
all
save
the
covering
screen
formed
by
the
light
division
and
the
cavalry
which
was
to
hold
its
ground
as
long
as
possible
before
falling
back
on
the
main
body
the
two
cavalry
regiments
which
had
been
sent
to
the
rear
in
the
middle
of
the
month
had
been
brought
up
again
to
the
azava
on
the
so
that
the
whole
of
the
small
force
of
that
arm
was
available
for
holding
back
the
french
advance
masséna
s
arrival
was
known
through
deserters
the
day
after
it
occurred
diary
of
simmons
of
the
wellington
had
less
troops
in
line
than
he
desired
mainly
owing
to
the
dreadful
depletion
in
the
ranks
of
the
portuguese
infantry
caused
by
the
inefficient
way
in
which
it
was
fed
by
its
government
and
the
slowness
with
which
convalescents
and
detached
parties
rejoined
their
colours
some
of
the
regiments
which
ought
to
have
shown
men
in
the
ranks
had
only
or
men
and
the
battalions
with
the
field
army
amounted
in
all
to
no
more
than
bayonets
on
may
though
they
had
shown
in
the
preceding
december
and
had
absorbed
many
drafts
since
that
date
the
single
portuguese
cavalry
brigade
with
the
army
was
in
even
worse
state
the
two
regiments
showing
but
sabres
in
line
though
they
had
mustered
nearly
during
the
winter
the
men
were
alive
but
the
chargers
had
disappeared
owing
as
wellington
maintained
to
bad
on
the
part
of
the
men
and
slack
supervision
on
the
part
of
the
regimental
officers
as
the
four
british
cavalry
corps
which
had
seen
the
same
service
during
the
last
two
months
were
only
horses
weaker
in
may
than
they
were
in
march
the
explanation
is
probably
correct
complaints
on
this
score
fill
up
great
parts
of
wellington
s
letters
of
the
april
and
may
vii
they
seem
slightly
to
overstate
the
deficiency
compared
with
morning
states
of
may
but
this
comes
from
his
persistent
habit
of
counting
only
rank
and
file
omitting
officers
and
sergeants
when
he
says
that
the
total
infantry
including
pack
was
only
while
it
works
out
to
over
when
that
detached
brigade
is
counted
we
must
remember
that
he
is
not
reckoning
anything
but
rank
and
file
wellington
attributes
most
of
the
loss
to
slackness
at
the
dépôts
in
forwarding
drafts
maladministration
of
the
hospitals
insufficient
food
at
the
front
for
those
brigades
still
fed
by
the
portuguese
government
and
not
taken
on
to
the
british
establishment
the
total
force
available
for
a
general
action
on
may
was
infantry
of
which
were
british
cavalry
including
the
portuguese
and
artillery
sappers
there
were
four
british
and
four
portuguese
batteries
with
guns
this
total
does
not
include
the
detachment
blockading
almeida
which
consisted
of
pack
s
brigade
and
one
british
battalion
while
only
weaker
than
masséna
in
infantry
it
will
be
seen
that
wellington
s
army
had
hardly
more
than
a
third
of
the
number
of
his
cavalry
to
in
guns
there
was
a
slight
superiority
pieces
to
in
a
mountain
position
such
as
that
of
bussaco
the
deficiency
of
cavalry
would
have
been
of
no
importance
but
the
between
almeida
and
rodrigo
is
mostly
undulating
plateau
practicable
in
most
parts
for
cavalry
operations
on
a
large
scale
the
only
obstacles
of
importance
are
the
courses
of
the
three
small
streams
which
cross
the
the
azava
dos
casas
and
turon
minor
tributaries
of
the
agueda
all
three
are
insignificant
brooks
save
after
heavy
rain
and
though
there
had
been
a
downfall
in
the
end
of
april
they
were
now
going
down
and
resuming
their
usual
proportions
their
waters
were
now
a
negligible
quantity
but
in
some
parts
of
their
course
they
flow
in
ravines
many
feet
below
the
general
level
of
the
plateau
and
present
a
serious
hindrance
to
the
movement
of
troops
this
is
especially
the
case
in
their
lower
course
nearer
the
hills
to
the
south
where
they
rise
the
ravines
as
well
as
the
streams
grow
smaller
and
can
be
crossed
anywhere
the
particular
position
which
wellington
had
selected
as
his
was
the
line
of
the
dos
casas
from
the
ruined
fort
concepcion
to
the
village
of
fuentes
de
oñoro
the
ravine
of
the
dos
casas
is
both
wide
and
steep
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
fort
perhaps
feet
deep
but
grows
decidedly
shallower
towards
fuentes
and
above
that
place
is
no
longer
a
notable
feature
in
the
the
stream
itself
is
nowhere
more
than
ten
yards
broad
nor
three
feet
deep
so
that
when
its
banks
cease
to
be
high
and
scarped
it
can
be
crossed
anywhere
by
infantry
cavalry
or
guns
its
valley
above
fuentes
is
partly
arable
partly
in
gentle
grassy
slopes
much
more
like
an
english
than
a
typical
spanish
landscape
standing
on
the
higher
ground
behind
the
village
the
observer
sees
a
marked
contrast
between
the
rocky
ravine
and
the
broad
undulating
bottom
to
his
right
the
ridge
however
on
which
he
is
standing
does
not
entirely
disappear
to
the
south
it
still
remains
as
the
watershed
between
the
little
basin
of
the
dos
casas
and
that
of
its
the
turon
which
flows
exactly
parallel
with
it
less
than
two
miles
to
the
west
the
view
is
closed
by
woods
surrounding
the
village
of
pozo
bello
or
posovelho
as
the
neighbouring
portuguese
call
it
on
the
right
or
further
bank
of
the
dos
casas
and
by
the
rounded
hill
of
nava
de
aver
below
which
the
river
is
flanked
on
both
sides
by
a
stretch
of
boggy
ground
only
to
be
crossed
by
some
invisible
paths
there
are
five
miles
from
fort
concepcion
to
fuentes
de
oñoro
village
and
this
was
wellington
s
original
position
entirely
covered
in
front
by
a
ravine
but
the
two
further
miles
from
fuentes
to
pozo
bello
which
he
proceeded
to
take
in
for
defence
when
the
enemy
showed
signs
of
turning
his
right
may
be
described
as
open
ground
with
no
protection
on
its
flank
save
the
morass
by
nava
de
aver
which
could
obviously
be
turned
by
any
enemy
who
chose
to
make
a
sufficiently
wide
circuit
and
might
be
crossed
by
infantry
at
some
points
after
careful
exploration
of
its
depths
fuentes
de
oñoro
itself
stands
on
the
western
bank
of
the
dos
casas
at
the
point
where
the
heights
begin
to
sink
and
the
ravine
ceases
its
lower
houses
are
almost
level
with
the
stream
but
the
village
slopes
uphill
to
two
points
a
little
higher
than
the
general
summit
of
the
plateau
one
of
which
is
crowned
by
its
church
the
other
by
a
cross
on
a
large
rock
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
stream
there
are
no
buildings
but
a
chapel
and
a
single
past
these
the
from
ciudad
rodrigo
ascends
on
a
gentle
slope
commanded
for
some
hundred
yards
by
the
heights
on
which
the
village
stands
so
that
any
force
advancing
to
attack
fuentes
comes
under
fire
early
and
has
no
cover
whatever
the
eligibility
of
the
place
as
a
post
is
much
increased
by
the
fact
that
the
houses
are
surrounded
by
numerous
stone
walls
making
crofts
and
gardens
which
are
of
a
height
and
strength
suitable
for
giving
excellent
cover
to
infantry
in
skirmishing
order
nor
can
it
easily
be
turned
since
to
the
left
it
is
protected
by
the
ravine
of
the
dos
casas
ever
growing
deeper
while
on
the
right
the
houses
trend
back
for
a
long
distance
up
the
slopes
and
the
stone
walls
continue
their
line
for
some
distance
in
short
it
is
an
admirable
point
on
which
to
rest
the
flank
of
an
army
in
battle
order
and
wellington
had
well
marked
its
strength
and
was
serene
and
content
so
long
as
the
french
ranged
their
forces
parallel
to
his
own
the
trouble
only
came
when
on
the
second
day
of
battle
they
extended
their
southern
wing
to
pozo
bello
so
that
fuentes
became
the
right
centre
instead
of
the
right
of
the
allied
army
the
general
position
behind
the
dos
casas
has
only
one
serious
defect
it
has
in
its
rear
at
a
distance
of
some
six
or
seven
miles
the
ravine
of
the
coa
passable
at
only
a
limited
number
of
points
for
artillery
and
wheeled
vehicles
though
there
are
many
more
at
which
infantry
or
cavalry
can
get
across
of
bridges
within
a
reasonable
distance
from
the
position
there
are
only
those
of
ponte
sequeiro
ten
miles
to
the
right
rear
of
castello
bom
six
miles
to
the
direct
rear
of
fuentes
village
and
of
almeida
eight
miles
to
the
left
rear
if
the
army
should
be
constrained
by
any
misfortune
to
retreat
its
transport
and
artillery
would
have
to
pass
over
one
or
more
of
these
three
defiles
of
which
the
first
is
inconveniently
placed
because
it
is
too
far
off
to
the
flank
while
the
third
had
been
broken
by
the
french
and
only
hastily
repaired
it
may
be
added
also
that
it
was
dangerously
close
to
almeida
though
out
of
sight
of
that
fortress
and
completely
beyond
the
range
of
its
cannon
but
to
have
sent
baggage
or
guns
across
it
might
have
appeared
a
little
hazardous
the
only
really
convenient
line
of
retreat
from
the
fuentes
position
was
that
across
the
bridge
of
castello
bom
a
structure
of
no
great
breadth
and
liable
to
become
congested
or
blocked
in
a
moment
of
hurry
it
was
only
wheeled
traffic
however
that
might
become
difficult
above
and
below
the
castello
bom
bridge
are
good
fords
for
infantry
and
cavalry
at
san
miguel
and
algeirenos
besides
numerous
other
points
where
troops
could
get
across
at
a
pinch
evidently
however
if
wellington
failed
to
hold
his
chosen
position
he
ran
the
risk
of
losing
some
or
all
of
his
supposing
that
he
were
vigorously
pursued
and
compelled
to
retreat
in
haste
a
caisson
overturned
on
the
descent
towards
the
bridge
might
force
him
to
abandon
whole
batteries
jammed
in
the
narrow
road
of
this
danger
he
was
well
aware
but
judged
it
worth
risking
in
view
of
the
importance
of
holding
the
best
possible
position
for
covering
the
siege
of
almeida
no
that
was
ever
chosen
is
destitute
of
some
fault
and
at
the
worst
the
infantry
and
cavalry
would
not
be
endangered
since
the
fords
could
not
fail
them
and
the
coa
though
its
ravine
is
often
steep
is
by
no
means
a
large
river
but
wellington
did
not
believe
that
he
could
be
beaten
by
the
force
which
masséna
was
able
to
bring
against
him
and
though
he
thought
over
orders
for
a
retreat
was
strongly
under
the
impression
that
he
would
never
have
to
issue
them
not
to
speak
of
the
bridge
of
sabugal
six
miles
above
the
ponte
sequeiro
and
hopelessly
out
on
the
flank
on
may
as
we
have
already
mentioned
the
whole
french
army
advanced
from
ciudad
rodrigo
one
column
on
the
road
the
other
on
the
southern
or
carpio
road
the
light
division
and
the
four
cavalry
regiments
accompanying
it
began
to
retire
according
to
their
directions
not
making
more
haste
than
was
necessary
and
turning
to
bay
occasionally
to
fight
a
small
rearguard
action
the
was
somewhat
dangerous
for
a
small
detaining
force
being
passable
for
cavalry
in
many
directions
and
thickly
wooded
it
had
to
be
remembered
that
the
enemy
using
the
cover
of
the
woods
and
hiding
himself
behind
the
undulations
of
the
ground
might
easily
break
through
the
screen
of
cavalry
and
light
troops
unless
great
care
and
caution
were
shown
fortunately
the
light
division
was
well
skilled
in
keeping
touch
along
the
line
and
in
avoiding
risks
and
a
whole
day
of
skirmishing
in
retreat
led
to
no
regrettable
incidents
on
the
night
of
the
of
may
the
covering
force
bivouacked
behind
gallegos
and
espeja
both
of
which
villages
were
occupied
by
the
advanced
guards
of
the
enemy
on
the
masséna
resumed
his
advance
and
drove
in
the
light
division
and
the
cavalry
upon
wellington
s
chosen
position
they
retired
skirmishing
till
they
came
to
the
main
body
when
the
four
cavalry
regiments
wheeled
into
line
on
the
right
rear
of
the
village
of
fuentes
de
oñoro
while
the
light
division
crossing
the
bridge
at
that
place
placed
itself
in
reserve
on
the
heights
behind
the
front
crest
in
the
afternoon
the
whole
french
army
became
more
or
less
visible
from
the
allies
position
it
was
now
in
three
columns
the
right
column
was
formed
by
the
corps
which
had
taken
the
route
and
displayed
itself
on
the
heights
opposite
wellington
s
left
facing
towards
fort
concepcion
and
san
pedro
with
the
deepest
part
of
the
ravine
of
the
dos
casas
in
front
of
it
the
centre
column
was
formed
by
the
single
division
of
the
corps
solignac
which
posted
itself
to
the
left
of
the
south
of
alameda
the
heaviest
and
most
important
mass
of
the
enemy
however
was
on
the
left
where
montbrun
s
cavalry
which
had
been
engaged
all
the
morning
in
pushing
back
the
british
horse
came
up
directly
opposite
fuentes
de
oñoro
and
on
finding
that
village
occupied
in
force
by
the
allies
took
ground
to
its
left
facing
the
squadrons
which
it
had
been
pursuing
on
the
other
side
of
the
dos
casas
when
the
cavalry
had
wheeled
aside
the
front
of
the
infantry
of
the
corps
became
visible
on
the
division
behind
division
the
corps
still
out
of
sight
in
the
rear
was
behind
the
so
that
five
of
the
eight
infantry
divisions
forming
masséna
s
army
were
concentrated
opposite
fuentes
de
oñoro
the
front
of
the
french
did
not
extend
for
more
than
a
short
distance
south
of
that
village
so
that
it
looked
as
if
wellington
was
to
be
assailed
precisely
in
the
strong
position
that
he
had
selected
the
allied
army
had
been
arrayed
at
leisure
on
the
ground
chosen
by
its
chief
who
had
ample
time
to
make
all
his
dispositions
while
the
covering
force
was
being
driven
in
his
line
was
formed
as
follows
the
division
erskine
was
posted
just
to
the
south
of
fort
concepcion
with
barbaçena
s
handful
of
portuguese
cavalry
only
sabres
watching
its
flank
next
to
the
south
of
erskine
lay
the
division
campbell
in
front
of
san
pedro
these
two
units
faced
reynier
and
junot
respectively
with
the
deep
ravine
protecting
their
front
the
and
divisions
and
ashworth
s
portuguese
brigade
were
arrayed
on
the
heights
behind
fuentes
de
oñoro
and
the
light
division
had
taken
post
in
their
reserve
the
houses
and
crofts
of
the
village
were
occupied
by
a
strong
force
of
picked
troops
composed
of
the
light
companies
of
nightingale
s
howard
s
and
löwe
s
brigades
of
the
division
and
of
mackinnon
s
colville
s
and
power
s
portuguese
brigades
of
the
division
companies
in
all
with
the
from
colville
s
brigade
in
support
the
senior
officer
in
the
village
was
williams
of
the
he
had
under
him
about
men
of
the
light
companies
all
chosen
shots
besides
the
of
the
to
the
south
and
rear
of
fuentes
some
way
behind
the
village
were
the
four
british
cavalry
regiments
only
sabres
in
gross
and
reduced
to
a
somewhat
lower
figure
by
detachments
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
wellington
like
masséna
had
strengthened
his
southern
wing
he
had
four
and
a
half
divisions
of
infantry
men
facing
the
and
corps
with
their
bayonets
and
horse
in
and
about
fuentes
while
the
corps
was
observed
by
erskine
s
men
and
the
corps
by
campbell
with
a
similar
number
in
the
northern
end
of
the
field
the
immense
strength
of
the
position
behind
the
ravine
enabled
wellington
to
be
economical
of
troops
if
it
should
chance
that
the
french
made
a
serious
attack
in
that
direction
there
were
ample
reserves
to
be
spared
from
the
mass
of
infantry
behind
the
right
wing
viz
the
light
companies
of
british
and
portuguese
battalions
plus
companies
of
the
of
the
and
extra
light
companies
of
the
attached
to
löwe
s
brigade
both
napier
iii
and
tomkinson
say
that
the
british
cavalry
nominally
sabres
had
only
about
in
line
that
day
owing
to
details
orderlies
absent
from
the
ranks
this
is
probably
an
deduction

men
ashworth
s
portuguese
men
or
masséna
having
surveyed
wellington
s
position
in
the
early
afternoon
recognized
without
difficulty
that
the
village
of
fuentes
was
the
key
of
the
whole
and
that
the
northern
front
was
too
formidable
from
the
nature
of
the
ground
to
be
lightly
meddled
with
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
the
disposition
of
the
allied
troops
for
in
accordance
with
his
usual
practice
their
general
had
placed
his
behind
the
crest
so
that
nothing
could
be
made
out
save
the
skirmishers
all
along
the
heights
and
the
garrison
of
fuentes
itself
which
was
sufficiently
visible
on
the
slope
in
a
manner
which
somewhat
suggests
his
old
method
of
bussaco
masséna
ordered
the
leading
division
of
the
corps
ferey
s
ten
battalions
to
storm
the
village
by
direct
frontal
attack
while
reynier
made
a
mere
demonstration
against
the
division
on
the
extreme
northern
end
of
the
position
the
latter
movement
led
to
nothing
save
that
when
it
seemed
threatening
wellington
sent
off
the
light
division
to
strengthen
his
right
wing
but
since
the
corps
never
closed
it
was
not
needed
there
and
halted
behind
the
crest
till
nightfall
the
statement
made
by
several
french
authors
that
masséna
did
not
order
ferey
to
attack
fuentes
on
the
and
that
loison
and
ferey
acted
without
orders
is
directly
contradicted
by
the
marshal
s
own
dispatch
in
which
he
takes
all
responsibility
j
espérais
enlever
fuentes
et
m
y
maintenir
je
le
fis
attaquer
et
il
fut
bientôt
in
fuentes
village
however
there
was
a
sharp
conflict
the
first
brigade
of
ferey
s
division
charged
across
the
easily
fordable
brook
under
heavy
fire
and
got
possession
of
some
of
the
houses
on
the
lower
slope
from
these
the
french
were
dislodged
by
the
charge
of
the
reserves
of
which
colonel
williams
could
dispose
the
second
brigade
was
then
thrown
into
action
by
ferey
and
coming
on
to
the
british
while
they
were
in
the
disorder
caused
by
a
charge
among
houses
and
walls
beat
them
back
and
pursued
them
up
to
the
top
of
the
village
here
the
light
companies
rallied
by
the
church
and
among
the
rocks
but
the
enemy
remained
for
a
moment
master
of
all
that
part
of
fuentes
which
lies
on
the
slope
and
in
the
bottom
by
the
brook
wellington
was
determined
that
the
french
should
make
no
lodgement
in
his
line
and
late
in
the
afternoon
sent
three
fresh
battalions
of
the
division
to
clear
the
village
cadogan
with
the
supported
by
the
and
made
a
determined
advance
through
the
tangle
of
houses
lanes
and
walls
and
at
considerable
cost
drove
ferey
s
men
right
over
the
brook
and
up
their
own
slope
masséna
then
ordered
the
defeated
troops
to
be
supported
by
four
battalions
from
marchand
s
division
and
with
this
aid
they
once
more
advanced
and
got
possession
of
the
chapel
and
the
few
other
buildings
on
the
east
side
of
dos
casas
but
could
not
make
their
way
across
the
water
again
or
into
the
main
body
of
the
village
the
combat
only
stopped
with
the
fall
of
night
though
the
fusillade
across
the
brook
was
of
course
objectless
when
neither
side
made
any
further
definite
attack
it
had
cost
the
french
men
mostly
in
ferey
s
division
of
whom
officers
and
men
were
prisoners
taken
when
the
village
was
by
cadogan
the
allies
being
on
the
defensive
and
under
cover

at
the
moment

the
original
commander
of

village
was
severely
wounded
but
no

officer
above
the

must
have
been
fairly
heavily
engaged

story
that

would
have
succeeded
if

the
battle
of

may
masséna
s
attempt
to
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
for
the
phrase
used
at
bussaco
may
well
be
repeated
for
the
attack
on
fuentes
village
had
failed
with
loss
it
was
clear
that
he
had
hit
upon
a
strong
point
in
wellington
s
line
and
he
had
paid
dearly
for
his
brutal
methods
it
remained
to
be
seen
whether
he
might
not
also
find
as
at
bussaco
some
way
of
turning
his
adversary
s
position
by
a
wide
flank
movement
the
ground
looked
very
impracticable
and
the
ravine
of
the
dos
casas
seemed
to
grow
more
and
more
formidable
as
it
neared
its
junction
with
the
agueda
the
marshal
therefore
ordered
montbrun
to
make
reconnaissances
in
every
direction
towards
the
right
on
the
side
of
pozo
bello
and
nava
de
aver
and
to
report
on
the
roads
and
the
character
of
the
ground
as
well
as
on
the
disposition
of
the
of
the
enemy
the
whole
of
the
of
may
was
taken
up
in
this
fashion
there
being
no
shots
fired
save
in
fuentes
de
oñoro
itself
when
ferey
s
troops
in
the
morning
exchanged
a
lively
fusillade
across
the
brook
with
the
british
regiments
occupying
the
main
block
of
the
village
the
firing
died
down
before
noon
neither
side
being
inclined
to
take
the
offensive
masséna
in
his
dispatch
describing
the
battle
says
that
on
the
morning
of
the
the
allies
made
a
serious
attempt
to
turn
ferey
out
of
the
houses
beyond
the
brook
which
he
occupied
but
we
have
no
trace
of
any
regular
fighting
in
any
of
the
british
narratives
there
was
certainly
some
bickering
across
the
brook
but
apparently
nothing
more
montbrun
s
reports
came
in
during
the
afternoon
and
were
very
important
the
enemy
he
said
had
no
more
than
a
screen
of
cavalry
pickets
to
the
south
of
fuentes
with

there
was
nothing
to
prevent
a
frontal
attack
on

by
infantry
though
the
place
was
enclosed
in

and
somewhat
difficult
to
approach
there
was
accessible
ground
between

and
nava
where

might
act

was

on
which

of

rested

this
report
masséna
based
his
new
scheme
of
operations
he
resolved
to
turn
wellington
s
right
with
three
infantry
divisions
and
nearly
the
whole
of
his
cavalry
while
detaining
him
in
his
present
position
by
attacks
more
or
less
pressed
home
the
was
to

composed
of
marchand

and

divisions
of
the

with
solignac
s
division
of

and
of
all

to
make
demonstrations
which
were
to
be
turned
into
a
serious
attack
only
if
the
allies
showed
weakness
in
this
direction
but
in
the
centre
there
was
to
be
a
vigorous
onslaught
launched
against
fuentes

the
turning

was

in
progress

in

opposite

told
off
but
also
drouet

divisions
of
the
corps
the
place
was
to
be
carried
at
all
costs
while
wellington
was
busy
on
his
right
and
a
breach
was
thus
to
be
made
in
the
line
of
the
allies
at
the
same
moment
that
their
wing
was
turned
fourteen
thousand
infantry
were
concentrated
opposite
fuentes
for
this
purpose
see
his
orders
for
the

xiii
after
dusk
had
fallen
the
french
army
made
the
preliminary
movements
required
by
the
new
plan
montbrun
s
cavalry
rode
out
far
to
the
south
one
brigade
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
of
nava
de
aver
the
others
to
the
ground
east
of
pozo
bello
to
this
latter
point
marchand
s
and
mermet
s
infantry
proceeded
with
solignac
s
division
following
them
drouet
brought
the
corps
to
the
ground
formerly
occupied
by
the
corps
while
reynier
drew
in
a
little
southward
leaving
one
division
opposite
fort
concepcion
but
moving
the
other
to
the
position
in
front
of
alameda
lately
occupied
by
solignac
a
large
detachment
of
sappers
went
out
with
montbrun
to
mend
the
paths
across
the
morass
which
his
flanking
brigade
had
to
cross
illustration
fuentes
de
oñoro
positions
on
the
first
day
may
wellington
had
not
been
unaware
that
the
want
of
movement
on
masséna
s
part
during
the
probably
covered
some
design
against
his
flanks
and
since
his
left
flank
was
practically
impregnable
he
suspected
that
his
right
might
be
in
danger
a
suspicion
which
was
made
into
certainty
by
reconnaissances
which
detected
the
french
stirring
among
the
marshy
woods
the
whole
of
his
cavalry
was
thrown
out
in
this
direction
but
the
four
regiments
could
only
cover
the
ground
inadequately
and
being
scattered
in
squadrons
along
three
miles
of
front
were
weak
everywhere
the
most
serious
movement
that
he
made
was
to
detach
the
division
as
an
outlying
force
to
cover
his
right
two
battalions
were
put
into
the
village
of
pozo
bello
and
the
wood
in
front
of
it
the
remaining
seven
occupied
a
position
on
the
slope
to
the
west
of
that
little
place
this
was
a
somewhat
dangerous
expedient
the
division
was
the
smallest
and
weakest
unit
in
wellington
s
army
it
only
contained
two
british
battalions
and
these
were
just
landed
at
lisbon
it
was
thrown
out
two
miles
from
the
main
position
and
on
open
ground
not
presenting
any
particular
advantage
for
defence
indeed
if
the
enemy
should
attack
in
strength
it
would
be
compelled
to
act
as
a
mere
detaining
and
observing
rather
than
a
fighting
force
for
though
it
was
well
placed
for
foiling
a
mere
attempt
to
turn
the
fuentes
position
by
a
small
detachment
and
a
short
lateral
movement
yet
if
the
enemy
s
flanking
manœuvre
were
made
by
a
large
body
and
far
afield
it
was
clear
that
the
division
would
have
to
retreat
in
haste
towards
the
main
position
this
being
so
one
wonders
that
wellington
did
not
select
one
of
his
best
divisions
the
or
the
light
for
such
a
responsible
post
but
he
apparently
did
not
foresee
the
whole
plan
of
masséna
imagining
he
writes
in
his
dispatch
describing
the
battle
that
the
enemy
would
endeavour
to
obtain
possession
of
fuentes
de
oñoro
and
of
the
ground
occupied
by
the
troops
behind
that
village
by
crossing
the
dos
casas
at
pozo
velho
i
moved
the
division
under
houston
to
the
right
in
order
to
protect
if
possible
that
but
masséna
was
set
not
only
on
attacking
pozo
bello
but
on
turning
it
and
taking
it
in
the
rear
by
a
wide
sweep
of
his
whole
disposable
cavalry
force
over
men
were
on
the
move
and
houston
had
but
infantry
with
horse
to
guard
his
flank
and
caçadores
and
the
other
regiments
being
foreign
and
brunswick
oels
or
portuguese
its
position
from
this
point
of
view
might
be
compared
to
that
of
pakenham
and
the
division
at
salamanca
the
other
preparation
which
wellington
made
for
a
possible
battle
on
the
was
to
draw
back
the
light
division
at
dusk
from
the
left
wing
to
its
original
position
behind
fuentes
village
in
reserve
he
also
withdrew
the
numerous
light
companies
which
had
formed
the
original
garrison
of
that
place
and
left
there
only
two
battalions
the
and
with
the
to
support
them
at
the
top
of
the
hill
the
fighting
on
the
of
may
began
very
early
just
at
daybreak
the
extreme
right
flank
of
wellington
s
cavalry
screen
was
attacked
by
the
outermost
of
the
enemy
s
turning
columns
composed
of
two
regiments
of
montbrun
s
dragoons
this
took
place
under
the
hill
of
nava
de
aver
where
julian
sanchez
with
his
guerrilleros
had
been
posted
on
the
while
two
squadrons
of
the
light
dragoons
had
been
moved
up
to
his
support
on
the
night
of
the
the
guerrilleros
kept
a
bad
and
in
the
dusk
of
the
morning
were
surprised
by
the
enemy
they
drew
off
hastily
to
the
south
without
making
any
resistance
not
so
the
two
british
squadrons
under
major
brotherton
of
the
who
fought
a
running
fight
for
two
miles
showing
front
repeatedly
till
their
flank
was
on
each
occasion
turned
by
the
vastly
superior
numbers
of
the
enemy
they
were
driven
in
at
last
upon
pozo
bello
where
lay
two
battalions
of
the
division
whose
extreme
right
picket
placed
in
a
wood
stopped
the
enemy
s
pursuit
by
a
volley
the
main
body
of
the
french
cavalry
seems
to
have
started
a
little
later
than
the
flanking
force
which
assailed
nava
de
aver
as
its
leading
regiments
only
attacked
the
british
cavalry
screen
to
the
right
of
that
village
some
time
after
brotherton
s
squadrons
had
begun
to
be
driven
in
here
the
line
of
observation
was
furnished
by
a
squadron
of
the
light
dragoons
and
another
of
the
hussars
of
the
king
s
german
legion
who
drew
together
and
gallantly
but
rather
rashly
attempted
to
stop
the
enemy
s
advance
at
a
defile
between
two
woods
the
squadron
of
the
charging
into
a
mass
of
the
enemy
suffered
heavily
and
had
its
commanding
officer
captured
the
germans
then
took
their
turn
but
were
also
driven
back
with
loss
the
broken
troops
had
to
fall
back
in
all
haste
till
like
brotherton
s
detachment
they
came
in
upon
the
flank
of
the
village
of
pozo
bello
and
formed
up
there
the
french
cavalry
extending
over
the
slopes
when
they
were
clear
of
the
woods
appeared
in
overpowering
numbers
and
showed
an
evident
intention
to
turn
the
right
flank
of
the
british
force
which
they
were
strong
enough
to
do
even
when
the
whole
twelve
squadrons
of
wellington
s
cavalry
falling
back
from
various
points
of
the
line
which
they
had
been
observing
were
concentrated
on
the
flank
of
the
woods
and
enclosures
of
pozo
bello
the
accusation
against
montbrun
made
by
napier
and
several
french
writers
of
having
waited
for
two
hours
after
dawn
and
then
of
having
suffered
himself
to
be
delayed
for
another
hour
by
the
pursuit
of
a
mere
spanish
irregular
band
is
clearly
groundless
we
have
the
diaries
of
two
officers
of
the
squadrons
of
the
major
brotherton
and
cornet
hall
who
prove
that
the
attack
was
made
in
the
dusk
of
early
dawn
just
at
daybreak
says
the
former
i
requested
don
julian
to
show
me
where
his
pickets
were
placed
he
pointed
out
to
me
what
he
said
was
one
of
them
but
i
observed
to
him
that
in
the
dusk
of
morning
it
looked
too
large
for
a
picket
the
sun
rising
rapidly
dispelled
the
fog
and
the
illusion
at
the
same
time
for
don
julian
s
picket
proved
to
be
a
whole
french
regiment
dismounted
they
now
mounted
immediately
and
advanced
against
see
the
diary
in
hamilton
s
of
the
captain
belli
who
had
joined
the
regiment
from
england
only
the
night
before
a
sergeant
and
six
men
were
killed
in
trying
to
rescue
him
see
tomkinson
s
diary
this
officer
of
the
accuses
major
meyer
of
the
hussars
of
having
lost
the
right
moment
for
a
charge
by
indecision
but
the
narratives
see
schwertfeger
show
that
meyer
fought
hard
and
was
an
enterprising
officer
up
to
this
moment
an
hour
after
daybreak
only
french
cavalry
had
been
seen
but
the
infantry
now
joined
in
the
two
divisions
of
marchand
and
mermet
had
been
moved
in
the
night
to
a
point
opposite
pozo
bello
when
the
skirmishing
to
the
right
of
that
place
was
growing
hot
the
leading
division
that
of
marchand
charged
in
upon
the
wood
in
front
of
the
village
cleared
out
of
it
the
skirmishers
of
the
regiment
and
the
caçadores
and
then
stormed
the
village
also
driving
out
of
it
the
two
battalions
which
vainly
tried
to
maintain
themselves
there
against
the
crushing
superiority
of
the
attack
as
they
were
emerging
from
among
the
houses
in
great
disorder
they
were
fallen
upon
and
ridden
over
by
a
french
light
cavalry
regiment
which
had
pushed
round
their
flank
unobserved
both
battalions
suffered
heavily
between
them
they
lost
over
men
of
whom
were
killed
and
wounded
and
some
unwounded
prisoners
it
is
marvellous
that
the
two
corps
were
not
entirely
destroyed
but
they
were
saved
by
a
charge
of
two
squadrons
of
the
german
hussars
and
succeeded
in
forming
up
with
promptness
and
moving
away
in
the
direction
of
the
main
body
of
the
division
which
was
visible
a
mile
to
the
west
on
the
opposite
slope
of
the
bottom
in
which
pozo
bello
lies
the
next
hour
was
a
very
dangerous
one
the
french
infantry
divisions
emerging
from
the
captured
village
and
the
woods
began
to
form
up
in
heavy
columns
threatening
both
to
attack
the
fuentes
de
oñoro
position
on
its
right
flank
and
to
cut
in
between
the
isolated
division
and
the
rest
of
the
army
montbrun
s
cavalry
displaying
regiment
after
regiment
came
on
in
hot
pursuit
of
the
troops
that
had
escaped
from
pozo
bello
and
of
the
british
squadrons
that
were
covering
them
they
were
already
outflanking
the
division
on
the
right
by
means
of
the
detachment
which
had
come
from
nava
de
aver
wellington
was
surprised
at
the
strength
of
the
turning
force
its
numbers
were
far
greater
than
he
had
foreseen
and
he
was
forced
to
take
a
new
resolution
and
form
a
fresh
the
most
important
thing
was
to
save
the
division
from
being
cut
off
and
to
bring
it
back
into
line
with
the
rest
of
the
army
accordingly
he
directed
a
chosen
unit
the
light
division
now
once
more
under
the
indomitable
craufurd
who
had
joined
on
the
preceding
night
to
advance
from
its
position
in
reserve
behind
fuentes
and
to
move
out
along
the
slope
of
the
low
heights
to
the
right
so
as
to
come
into
touch
with
houston
and
the
cavalry
and
to
help
them
to
get
home
meanwhile
the
rest
of
the
centre
of
the
army
the
and
divisions
and
ashworth
s
portuguese
formed
a
new
line
of
battle
to
the
original
right
flank
of
the
british
position
they
were
drawn
up
along
the
dominating
ground
between
the
rocky
hillocks
that
overhang
the
village
of
fuentes
and
the
descent
into
the
valley
of
the
turon
brook
this
is
the
last
of
the
high
ground
to
the
right
of
it
as
has
been
before
mentioned
the
watershed
between
the
dos
casas
and
the
turon
ceases
to
be
composed
of
a
commanding
ridge
and
sinks
into
gentle
slopes
thus
fuentes
de
oñoro
became
the
projecting
point
of
a
thrown
back
at
right
angles
to
the
original
position
where
the
and
divisions
still
continued
to
occupy
their
old
post
opposite
reynier
formations
are
proverbially
dangerous
because
of
the
liability
of
the
angle
to
be
enfiladed
and
crushed
by
artillery
fire
but
in
this
case
the
danger
was
less
than
usual
since
wellington
for
once
in
his
life
had
more
guns
than
the
french
and
the
lie
of
the
plateau
was
such
that
the
lower
parts
of
fuentes
village
might
be
enfiladed
but
not
the
ground
above
it
by
the
church
and
rocks
nor
the
plateau
behind
it
where
the
ground
occupied
by
the
division
was
out
of
sight
of
the
french
on
the
lesser
heights
indeed
the
holding
of
the
houses
in
the
bottom
was
of
comparatively
little
importance
to
wellington
so
long
as
he
kept
his
grip
on
the
upper
end
of
the
straggling
village
here
on
the
height
crowned
by
the
church
and
the
rocks
was
the
real
pivot
of
the
position
division
in
four
brigades
on
the
right
then
ashworth
then
the
division
next
to
fuentes
village
along
which
the
modern
railway
line
is
conducted
from
villar
formoso
to
ciudad
rodrigo
fuentes
de
oñoro
station
is
a
mile
from
the
village
and
only
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
portuguese
of
villar
formoso
wellington
had
ample
time
to
move
the
and
divisions
with
ashworth
s
portuguese
into
the
new
position
none
of
them
had
much
over
a
mile
to
march
since
all
had
been
concentrated
behind
fuentes
when
the
alarm
came
the
enemy
s
approach
was
slow
partly
because
his
infantry
had
to
disentangle
itself
from
the
houses
of
pozo
bello
and
the
surrounding
wood
and
to
form
in
a
fresh
front
partly
because
his
cavalry
became
wholly
absorbed
in
a
running
fight
with
the
light
and
divisions
and
had
no
attention
to
spare
for
any
other
direction
masséna
s
plan
when
he
had
got
his
left
wing
out
of
the
woods
soon
became
clear
he
was
intending
to
break
in
with
his
cavalry
between
the
division
and
the
rest
of
the
army
while
marchand
and
mermet
were
to
attack
the
new
front
of
the
and
divisions
and
the
corps
with
ferey
s
division
was
to
smash
in
the
projecting
point
of
wellington
s
position
by
storming
fuentes
village
and
the
height
behind
it
reynier
as
on
the
of
may
was
to
demonstrate
against
the
allied
left
but
not
to
attack
till
success
in
the
centre
seemed
assured
from
the
course
of
the
action
it
is
evident
that
the
marshal
s
main
intention
was
to
beat
wellington
by
hard
fighting
and
to
break
up
his
army
not
merely
to
manœuvre
him
into
a
bad
strategical
position
and
to
cut
his
more
available
lines
of
communication
so
as
to
force
him
into
a
difficult
and
dangerous
retreat
if
the
last
had
been
masséna
s
intention
as
some
authors
suggest
the
course
of
the
battle
would
have
been
different
but
he
made
no
attempt
to
send
cavalry
to
intercept
the
roads
to
castello
bom
still
less
to
detach
infantry
against
wellington
s
rear
having
turned
his
enemy
s
flank
and
forced
him
to
make
a
new
front
he
showed
no
further
desire
to
manœuvre
but
proceeded
to
batter
away
at
the
troops
in
front
of
him
trusting
that
numbers
and
impetus
would
secure
him
the
victory
the
fight
fell
for
some
time
into
two
absolutely
distinct
sections
an
attempt
by
drouet
s
and
ferey
s
three
divisions
to
carry
fuentes
de
oñoro
village
and
break
wellington
s
centre
and
an
attempt
to
cut
up
by
the
cavalry
arm
alone
the
division
and
its
attendant
squadrons
before
they
could
be
succoured
and
drawn
back
into
wellington
s
new
line
of
defence
it
was
only
after
some
time
that
these
two
combats
became
joined
by
an
attempt
which
was
never
pressed
home
to
attack
that
part
of
the
british
position
which
lay
to
the
right
rear
of
fuentes
de
oñoro
the
fighting
west
of
pozo
bello
may
be
taken
first
as
it
was
a
logical
continuation
of
the
engagement
in
the
early
morning
here
montbrun
had
under
his
hand
four
cavalry
brigades
those
of
wathier
fournier
cavrois
and
ornano
about
sabres
with
lepic
s
guard
cavalry
as
his
reserve
though
as
it
turned
out
in
the
end
the
use
of
that
reserve
was
to
be
denied
him
in
front
of
him
were
the
two
battalions
recently
evicted
from
pozo
bello
with
the
british
cavalry
brigades
of
slade
and
arentschildt
about
sabres
and
bull
s
troop
which
had
drawn
up
to
protect
the
retreat
of
the
routed
battalions
towards
the
main
body
of
the
division
general
houston
with
that
force
one
british
battalion
two
foreign
and
four
portuguese
battalions
was
engaged
in
taking
up
new
ground
on
the
slope
which
is
separated
from
pozo
bello
by
the
shallow
trough
forming
the
valley
of
the
dos
casas
brook
montbrun
s
object
was
of
course
to
break
the
british
horsemen
and
then
to
fall
upon
and
destroy
the
shaken
infantry
which
they
were
protecting
before
they
could
cross
the
valley
there
resulted
a
very
fierce
and
cavalry
combat
infinitely
creditable
to
the
four
british
regiments
who
had
to
fight
a
detaining
action
against
numbers
about
double
their
own
they
were
bound
to
retire
in
the
end
and
indeed
had
no
other
intention
but
it
was
their
duty
to
hold
off
the
enemy
till
the
infantry
behind
them
had
got
into
order
this
was
done
though
at
great
cost
the
regiments
retiring
by
alternate
squadrons
while
the
rear
squadron
at
each
change
of
front
charged
often
winning
a
temporary
and
partial
success
over
the
enemy
in
its
immediate
front
but
always
forced
to
give
back
as
the
french
reserve
came
up
when
we
charged
wrote
a
participant
in
this
long
combat
they
would
often
turn
their
horses
and
our
men
shouted
in
the
pursuit
but
go
which
way
they
might
we
were
but
scattered
drops
amid
their
host
and
could
not
possibly
arrest
their
progress
we
had
again
to
go
about
and
retire
the
british
cavalry
though
losing
heavily
never
got
out
of
hand
and
could
be
still
used
as
efficient
units
down
to
the
end
of
this
phase
of
the
battle
of
their
total
casualty
list
of
nearly
all
must
have
been
lost
in
this
hard
work
it
is
noticeable
that
only
one
officer
and
four
men
were
taken
prisoners
a
sufficient
proof
that
there
was
no
such
rout
as
french
accounts
describe
for
a
rout
always
implies
a
serious
loss
in
foot
the
incomplete
battalion
of
brunswick
oels
short
of
two
companies
detached
and
the
and
portuguese
commanded
on
this
day
by
doyle
colonel
of
the
unpublished
diary
of
hall
of
the
light
dragoons
after
a
running
fight
the
british
cavalry
was
driven
back
on
to
the
division
which
now
joined
by
the
two
detached
battalions
was
drawn
up
on
the
best
position
that
houston
could
select
on
the
slope
above
the
valley
his
centre
was
in
a
projecting
angle
among
some
rocks
which
crop
up
in
the
generally
bare
hillside
his
wings
thrown
back
and
partly
covered
by
stone
walls
forming
the
boundaries
of
meadows
the
british
squadrons
clearing
off
to
the
side
took
position
on
the
left
rear
of
the
infantry
leaving
the
division
in
face
of
the
now
rather
confused
mass
of
montbrun
s
horsemen
whose
order
was
none
the
better
for
the
long
and
combat
in
which
they
had
been
engaged
the
french
general
made
a
serious
attempt
to
break
into
the
division
while
skirmishers
demonstrated
against
its
front
and
a
light
battery
just
sent
forward
by
masséna
shelled
its
centre
a
brigade
of
dragoons
turned
its
right
wing
and
tried
to
roll
it
up
this
attack
was
foiled
by
the
who
drawn
up
behind
a
long
stone
wall
had
apparently
escaped
montbrun
s
notice
receiving
a
staggering
volley
at
close
range
just
when
they
supposed
that
they
had
come
upon
an
unprotected
flank
the
advancing
squadrons
fell
back
in
confusion
another
charge
made
against
the
was
also
beaten
off
by
musketry
the
french
then
came
to
a
stand
it
was
clear
that
they
wanted
infantry
if
they
were
to
get
any
advantage
over
the
division
which
was
now
well
settled
down
into
its
position
but
marchand
s
and
mermet
s
battalions
had
not
followed
montbrun
across
the
valley
but
had
begun
to
march
straight
against
the
centre
of
wellington
s
new
line
west
of
fuentes
de
oñoro
see
journal
of
wheeler
of
the
pp
at
this
moment
a
new
force
came
upon
the
scene
craufurd
and
the
light
division
were
at
hand
marching
along
the
higher
slope
of
the
watershed
between
the
turon
and
the
dos
casas
in
order
to
connect
with
the
division
but
craufurd
had
not
come
to
form
up
and
hold
the
ground
where
houston
was
already
engaged
wellington
s
orders
were
that
the
division
should
move
to
its
rear
cross
the
turon
and
prolong
to
the
west
of
that
stream
the
new
line
already
formed
by
the
and
divisions
it
was
to
make
this
movement
covered
by
the
light
division
and
the
cavalry
who
were
to
hold
the
slope
till
houston
was
well
on
his
way
and
out
of
danger
they
were
then
to
retire
behind
the
division
this
was
a
dangerous
task
for
craufurd
and
his
men
but
wellington
had
selected
them
precisely
because
he
knew
that
they
were
to
be
trusted
while
montbrun
was
busy
rearranging
his
disordered
brigades
houston
slipped
down
the
reverse
slope
of
the
hillside
where
he
had
been
lying
crossed
the
turon
and
finally
drew
up
with
one
brigade
sontag
s
on
the
heights
west
of
that
stream
and
the
other
doyle
s
portuguese
in
the
village
of
freneda
a
mile
further
to
the
right
thus
wellington
had
once
more
an
outlying
covering
the
roads
which
lead
to
the
coa
and
the
bridge
of
castello
bom
with
the
exception
of
the
two
battalions
cut
up
at
the
opening
of
the
fight
the
division
had
suffered
very
slightly
apparently
the
french
cavalry
had
not
harmed
it
but
their
attached
battery
had
caused
some
casualties
which
came
in
all
to
no
more
than
men
out
of
the
in
the
seven
battalions
which
had
not
fought
at
pozo
bello
the
lost
men
brunswick
oels
portuguese
men
men
of
these
only
were
prisoners
so
that
it
is
clear
that
the
french
cavalry
never
got
in
among
them
or
cut
them
up
in
the
style
described
by
pelet
fournier
fririon
or
masséna
himself
when
a
body
of
infantry
attacked
by
cavalry
has
only
casualties
we
know
that
no
part
of
it
can
have
been
ridden
over
or
seriously
broken
on
the
departure
of
the
division
all
the
peril
and
responsibility
now
fell
on
craufurd
and
the
already
cavalry
who
had
to
make
their
way
back
for
a
full
mile
along
the
open
slope
of
the
hillside
to
join
their
comrades
in
the
new
position
south
of
fuentes
montbrun
though
he
had
failed
in
his
attack
on
infantry
in
position
thought
that
he
ought
to
have
better
fortune
against
men
retreating
over
a
rolling
upland
so
urged
the
pursuit
with
great
energy
craufurd
formed
his
men
in
battalion
squares
save
a
few
companies
of
the
rifles
and
caçadores
whom
he
threw
into
thickets
and
enclosures
to
the
right
and
left
where
he
thought
them
safe
against
horsemen
the
main
body
retreated
in
a
line
of
squares
with
the
cavalry
and
the
battery
of
horse
artillery
in
the
intervals
whenever
the
french
came
forward
the
guns
played
upon
them
and
the
british
cavalry
charged
by
squadrons
to
check
the
onslaught
so
beautifully
was
the
retreat
managed
that
montbrun
never
got
a
chance
to
charge
the
infantry
at
advantage
the
steadiness
and
regularity
with
which
the
troops
performed
their
movement
the
whole
time
exposed
to
a
cannonade
and
followed
across
a
plain
by
a
numerous
cavalry
ready
to
pounce
on
the
squares
if
the
least
disorder
should
be
detected
was
acknowledged
by
hundreds
of
unprejudiced
spectators
who
witnessed
it
from
the
heights
to
have
been
a
masterpiece
of
military
evolution
we
sustained
a
very
trifling
loss
from
the
cannonade
writes
one
light
division
officer
another
napier
himself
in
more
stirring
phrases
tells
how
many
times
montbrun
threatened
to
charge
craufurd
s
squares
but
always
found
them
too
dangerous
to
meddle
with
they
appeared
but
as
specks
with
close
behind
them
read
horsemen
trampling
bounding
shouting
for
the
word
to
charge
fifteen
guns
were
up
with
the
french
cavalry
the
eighth
corps
was
in
order
of
battle
behind
them
the
woods
on
their
right
were
filled
with
loison
s
skirmishers
and
if
that
general
pivoting
upon
fuentes
had
come
forth
with
the
corps
while
drouet
assailed
the
village
and
the
cavalry
made
a
general
charge
the
loose
crowd
of
and
broken
troops
would
have
been
violently
dashed
against
the
division
to
intercept
its
fire
and
break
its
ranks
and
the
battle
might
have
been
lost
but
montbrun
knew
as
well
as
craufurd
that
intact
infantry
of
good
quality
can
not
be
broken
when
it
is
securely
formed
in
square
and
any
attempt
to
molest
the
light
division
by
artillery
fire
was
checked
by
the
efforts
of
the
british
cavalry
and
guns
who
fought
their
best
to
keep
off
the
enemy
bull
s
guns
were
incessantly
unlimbering
and
firing
a
few
rounds
in
the
intervals
of
the
squares
and
then
retreating
rapidly
to
a
new
position
on
the
only
occasion
when
a
french
battery
got
close
up
it
was
charged
in
front
with
desperate
gallantry
by
a
squadron
of
the
light
dragoons
who
suffered
terribly
but
won
the
necessary
minutes
for
the
square
to
which
it
was
neighbour
to
get
out
of
range
at
last
the
whole
retiring
force
horse
and
foot
came
into
wellington
s
lines
with
the
french
close
in
their
rear
and
found
safety
with
the
division
two
incidents
marked
the
last
moments
of
the
retreat
at
one
point
occurred
an
episode
which
napier
has
immortalized
with
some
inaccuracy
of
detail
in
one
of
his
most
brilliant
purple
captain
norman
ramsay
with
two
guns
of
bull
s
troop
had
halted
not
for
the
first
time
for
a
shot
or
two
at
the
pursuing
cavalry
lingering
a
moment
too
long
he
found
himself
cut
off
just
as
he
had
limbered
up
by
a
swarm
of
who
rode
in
from
the
flank
but
he
put
his
guns
to
the
gallop
and
charging
himself
in
front
of
them
with
the
mounted
gunners
was
cutting
his
way
through
the
french
when
he
was
brought
off
by
friends
on
one
side
a
squadron
of
the
light
dragoons
under
brotherton
on
the
other
a
squadron
of
the
royals
had
turned
back
when
they
saw
the
artillery
in
danger
they
fell
upon
the
before
ramsay
had
suffered
any
hurt
and
saved
him
and
his
guns
which
were
brought
into
the
lines
of
the
division
amid
loud
cheers
from
all
who
had
seen
the
affair
leach
of
the
of
an
old
by
some
error
napier
says
the
corps
but
the
only
division
of
that
corps
present
solignac
was
in
reserve
far
off
napier
iii
see
brotherton
s
memoir
in
hamilton
s
of
the
light
pp
at
fuentes
d
oñoro
we
had
a
very
fine
fellow
captain
knipe
killed
through
his
gallant
obstinacy
if
i
may
so
call
it
we
had
the
night
before
been
discussing
the
best
mode
for
cavalry
to
attack
batteries
in
the
open
field
he
maintained
contrary
to
us
all
that
they
ought
to
be
charged
in
front
instead
of
by
gaining
their
flank
and
avoiding
their
fire
the
experiment
next
day
was
fatal
to
him
he
had
the
opportunity
of
charging
a
french
battery
which
he
did
by
attacking
immediately
in
front
their
discharge
of
round
shot
he
got
through
with
little
loss
but
they
most
rapidly
reloaded
with
grape
and
his
party
got
a
close
and
murderous
discharge
which
almost
entirely
destroyed
it
he
himself
receiving
a
grape
shot
through
the
as
montbrun
had
not
got
up
his
guns
during
the
first
cavalry
charges
this
must
have
been
during
craufurd
s
fight
napier
makes
two
serious
errors
he
represents
ramsay
as
having
a
whole
battery
instead
of
two
guns
only
and
he
underrates
the
assistance
given
by
the
cavalry
which
is
detailed
in
brotherton
s
memoir
as
well
as
in
the
regimental
history
of
the
royals
a
little
to
the
left
of
the
point
where
this
happy
escape
took
place
there
was
an
episode
of
a
less
fortunate
kind
the
skirmishing
line
of
the
division
was
extended
along
the
foot
of
the
slope
on
which
its
brigades
were
arrayed
when
the
rolling
mass
composed
of
the
light
division
squares
their
attendant
cavalry
and
the
french
in
hot
pursuit
drew
near
to
the
position
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
pickets
of
the
guards
brigade
hill
of
the
guards
directed
them
to
close
up
into
solid
order
for
safety
s
sake
this
they
did
forming
a
small
square
in
this
formation
they
beat
off
the
rather
disorderly
charge
of
the
french
horse
but
colonel
hill
then
very
unwisely
extended
them
again
and
thus
exposed
them
in
the
most
dangerous
order
to
a
second
charge
of
a
french
regiment
which
came
in
from
the
side
after
the
main
attack
was
over
the
three
companies
were
taken
in
flank
rolled
up
and
very
badly
mauled
sixty
or
eighty
men
being
killed
or
wounded
and
hill
himself
with
another
officer
and
nineteen
men
being
taken
prisoners
the
rest
had
time
to
club
together
and
defend
themselves
till
they
were
rescued
by
the
charge
of
a
squadron
of
the
royals
under
colonel
clifton
and
a
troop
of
the
light
dragoons
which
brought
off
most
of
the
survivors
the
total
loss
was
about
men
the
account
of
this
in
wellington
s
dispatch
is
hopelessly
obscure
because
instead
of
writing
the
pickets
of
the
division
under
hill
he
wrote
by
a
slip
of
the
pen
the
of
the
division
under
hill
of
course
being
a
regimental
major
though
a
titular
after
the
guards
system
did
not
command
whole
regiments
as
wellington
s
words
imply
but
simply
the
skirmishing
line
of
pickets
the
facts
are
made
quite
clear
by
stepney
of
the
coldstreams
and
stothert
s
diary
who
calls
them
the
pickets
of
the
guards
grattan
who
calls
them
the
advance
or
the
light
troops
of
the
division
and
hall
s
unpublished
diary
which
gives
the
whole
story
in
a
nutshell
the
enemy
made
a
dart
at
the
pickets
of
the
division
with
the
expectation
of
sweeping
off
the
line
before
our
cavalry
could
support
them
they
succeeded
in
part
by
coming
up
unexpectedly
but
when
they
were
perceived
the
men
by
collecting
into
knots
or
hiving
as
they
called
it
repulsed
them
with
the
bayonet
a
troop
of
the
light
dragoons
and
some
of
the
royals
were
ordered
out
to
the
skirmish
and
suffered
some
it
is
this
incident
which
general
fournier
who
led
the
charge
transforms
in
his
dispatch
in
the
de
la
into
the
breaking
two
squares
of
the
light
division
and
taking
general
craufurd
prisoner
a
wild
story
fririon
makes
the
charge
capture
hussars
of
the
english
royal
guard
both
say
that
three
battalions
of
the
guards
laid
down
their
arms
deducting
the
regiments
in
fuentes
de
oñoro
and
the
division
lost
about
men
in
the
whole
day
of
whom
probably
in
this
petty
disaster
this
was
only
one
of
several
partial
attacks
made
by
the
french
cavalry
against
the
front
of
wellington
s
new
position
montbrun
seems
to
have
thought
that
he
could
continue
to
press
the
allies
not
recognizing
that
he
had
hitherto
had
to
do
with
troops
voluntarily
retiring
but
had
now
run
against
a
which
intended
to
stand
indeed
he
wished
to
try
the
effect
of
a
general
charge
against
the
front
of
the
division
and
with
that
object
sent
orders
to
his
reserve
lepic
s
brigade
of
guard
cavalry
to
come
to
the
front
and
head
an
advance
which
the
rallied
squadrons
of
his
main
body
would
support
lepic
however
refused
to
move
saying
that
personally
he
was
only
too
ready
to
attack
but
that
he
had
received
specific
orders
not
to
use
his
brigade
save
at
the
direct
command
of
his
immediate
superior
marshal
bessières
while
the
marshal
was
being
sought
he
was
ultimately
found
after
much
delay
behind
pozo
bello
the
moment
which
montbrun
supposed
suitable
for
a
charge
passed
away
one
was
repelled
by
the
which
met
it
in
line
of
this
episode
only
hinted
at
by
fririon
and
not
mentioned
at
all
by
masséna
in
his
official
dispatch
we
have
a
vivid
description
in
marbot
which
might
be
doubted
if
it
were
not
borne
out
by
hints
in
napier
and
thiébault
and
by
the
direct
statement
of
marshal
jourdan
in
his
memoirs
if
lepic
had
charged
it
is
hard
to
see
what
effect
he
could
have
produced
for
all
peninsular
experience
went
to
prove
that
infantry
in
battle
order
on
a
good
position
could
not
be
broken
by
cavalry
however
daring
the
and
divisions
were
well
established
on
their
ground
with
a
steep
slope
below
them
and
could
not
have
been
moved
lepic
s
refusal
to
charge
however
always
takes
a
prominent
part
in
the
description
of
fuentes
de
oñoro
by
french
writers
not
who
are
anxious
to
prove
that
wellington
ought
to
have
lost
the
battle
with
this
episode
the
advance
of
montbrun
s
cavalry
ended
frittering
itself
away
on
the
edge
of
the
new
position
of
the
allies
its
total
effect
had
been
to
roll
in
the
flanking
force
which
wellington
had
thrown
out
and
to
gain
some
three
miles
of
ground
the
loss
of
the
british
had
been
appreciable
but
can
hardly
be
called
severe
under
in
the
division
about
in
the
cavalry
and
in
the
division
montbrun
s
squadrons
on
their
side
had
casualties
to
which
may
be
added
perhaps
a
hundred
in
marchand
s
division
of
the
corps
which
fought
in
the
attack
on
pozo
bello
the
strategical
advantage
obtained
by
forcing
wellington
to
throw
back
his
right
wing
and
to
leave
the
roads
towards
castello
bom
exposed
to
the
possibility
of
flanking
cavalry
raids
was
considerable
but
it
was
less
important
than
it
appeared
since
the
mere
threatening
of
his
communications
was
useless
unless
he
could
be
forced
or
manœuvred
out
of
his
position
and
this
was
not
to
be
done
he
himself
saw
this
clearly
writing
in
his
dispatch
which
describes
the
battle
i
had
occupied
poço
velho
and
that
neighbourhood
in
hopes
that
i
should
be
able
to
maintain
the
communication
across
the
coa
by
sabugal
as
well
as
to
provide
for
the
blockade
of
almeida
which
objects
as
was
now
obvious
were
become
incompatible
with
each
other
i
therefore
abandoned
that
which
was
the
less
important
he
then
proceeds
to
show
how
his
new
position
still
covered
the
blockade
of
almeida
and
by
means
of
the
troops
placed
beyond
the
turon
rendered
it
hard
for
the
enemy
to
make
any
real
attempt
towards
castello
bom
since
this
could
not
be
done
save
by
an
isolated
detachment
indeed
masséna
had
still
to
beat
the
allied
army
and
the
preliminary
operations
now
ended
had
done
nothing
more
than
thrust
it
back
into
its
fighting
position
to
lord
liverpool
may
vii
that
according
to
masséna
s
design
the
second
act
of
the
battle
was
to
consist
in
a
vigorous
attempt
to
break
wellington
s
new
line
is
clear
from
his
own
dispatch
and
the
point
to
be
pierced
was
the
projecting
angle
of
its
centre
in
and
to
the
right
of
fuentes
village
here
the
attack
was
to
be
concentric
and
enveloping
ferey
s
division
and
the
two
divisions
of
the
corps
being
intended
to
storm
the
village
after
which
marchand
s
and
mermet
s
divisions
supported
by
solignac
s
were
to
assail
the
heights
to
its
where
picton
and
spencer
were
now
in
line
six
of
the
eight
infantry
divisions
of
the
french
army
were
to
attack
on
a
front
of
not
much
over
a
mile
this
was
a
powerful
combination
but
the
position
which
it
was
to
assail
was
also
very
strong
the
village
with
its
barricaded
streets
and
its
tiers
of
houses
trending
up
the
hill
was
susceptible
of
indefinite
defence
the
hillside
above
it
and
to
its
right
was
a
perfect
with
the
ravine
in
its
front
fine
artillery
emplacements
along
the
and
a
flat
plateau
behind
on
which
the
main
line
and
the
reserves
could
stand
sheltered
till
the
moment
when
they
were
required
to
deal
with
an
infantry
attack
masséna
s
plan
was
to
storm
the
village
first
and
then
when
ferey
and
drouet
should
have
pushed
through
it
and
have
got
a
lodgement
on
the
plateau
to
deliver
the
frontal
attack
with
the
other
three
divisions
he
did
not
intend
marchand
and
mermet
to
move
till
the
projecting
angle
of
wellington
s
line
was
turned
and
broken
in
by
the
success
of
the
other
attack
for
to
send
forward
these
two
divisions
of
the
corps
for
an
assault
on
the
fine
position
opposite
them
while
it
was
held
by
intact
troops
with
their
flanks
properly
covered
would
have
been
to
invite
a
repetition
of
bussaco
the
plateau
was
held
by
a
perfectly
adequate
force
the
four
brigades
of
the
division
minus
three
battalions
detached
to
hold
fuentes
de
oñoro
ashworth
s
portuguese
brigade
and
the
whole
division
over
men
on
a
short
front
while
the
light
division
had
now
returned
to
take
its
place
in
reserve
wellington
had
these
troops
drawn
up
in
a
double
line
the
division
next
the
turon
ashworth
s
brigade
in
the
centre
and
the
division
above
fuentes
whose
defence
it
was
to
feed
if
necessary
by
detaching
battalions
from
its
second
line
which
was
formed
by
mackinnon
s
brigade
owing
to
the
numerical
inferiority
of
the
french
artillery
wellington
had
also
been
able
to
concentrate
a
larger
number
of
guns
six
batteries
on
the
critical
point
of
the
battlefield
than
his
enemy
could
bring
against
him
so
that
the
artillery
preparation
to
maul
his
line
before
a
general
attack
was
bound
to
fail
the
french
guns
were
overpowered
in
the
contest
and
from
nightingale
s
brigade
and
the
from
howard
s
in
all
bayonets
leaving
the
remainder
of
the
division
with
bayonets
the
division
with
and
ashworth
with
as
the
main
line
holding
the
plateau
with
of
craufurd
s
light
division
in
reserve
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
masséna
waited
for
the
arrival
of
marchand
s
and
mermet
s
infantry
in
front
of
the
position
before
commencing
his
attack
the
troops
opposite
fuentes
had
been
ordered
to
storm
the
village
when
montbrun
s
operations
had
begun
to
develop
successfully
but
sans
rien
hasarder
they
were
not
to
move
if
the
attempt
to
turn
the
british
right
failed
but
when
the
cavalry
were
seen
sweeping
the
hillsides
beyond
pozo
bello
and
driving
the
enemy
before
them
the
attack
on
fuentes
was
begun
by
ferey
s
division
which
was
already
in
possession
of
the
few
houses
on
the
east
side
of
the
dos
casas
brook
the
assault
commenced
at
about
two
hours
after
dawn
when
the
combat
was
already
in
full
progress
to
the
south
by
a
brisk
attack
which
drove
the
defenders
of
the
village
the
and
out
of
its
lower
portion
two
companies
of
the
latter
regiment
barricaded
in
some
buildings
near
the
water
were
completely
surrounded
and
forced
to
surrender
after
all
their
officers
had
been
wounded
men
were
taken
prisoners
the
remainder
of
this
highland
battalion
and
of
its
countrymen
of
the
rallied
in
the
upper
end
of
the
village
and
when
joined
by
the
regiment
in
reserve
the
came
forward
again
and
drove
the
french
into
the
lower
houses
by
the
river
the
fight
came
to
a
standstill
for
a
moment
ferey
s
division
which
had
already
suffered
so
severely
on
the
being
now
a
spent
force
so
far
as
initiative
went
masséna
s
dispatch
see
appendix
no
xiii
drouet
is
therefore
wrongly
blamed
by
french
critics
who
say
that
he
attacked
an
hour
or
two
late
he
had
to
wait
to
see
the
turning
movement
in
successful
progress
but
drouet
who
had
been
told
to
give
ferey
his
best
support
then
fed
the
fight
with
three
d
composed
of
the
eighteen
grenadier
companies
of
his
two
divisions
these
picked
troops
who
were
mistaken
for
men
of
the
imperial
guard
by
their
opponents
because
of
their
bearskins
and
tall
plumes
came
on
with
great
courage
and
cleared
all
the
middle
slopes
of
the
village
driving
the
garrison
up
to
the
summit
of
the
hill
near
the
church
and
the
rocks
the
fighting
was
very
deadly
to
both
sides
but
more
so
to
the
french
who
had
to
dislodge
an
obstinate
foe
from
barricaded
houses
and
lines
of
stone
walls
it
ended
in
the
establishment
of
the
attacking
force
on
the
brink
of
the
summit
but
further
the
grenadiers
could
not
go
the
head
of
the
village
and
the
plateau
above
it
was
still
maintained
by
the
and
and
wellington
began
to
feed
the
defending
force
by
drafting
into
the
upper
end
of
fuentes
one
after
another
the
light
companies
of
several
brigades
of
the
and
divisions
the
same
detachments
who
had
defended
the
village
upon
may
in
succession
those
of
löwe
s
german
brigade
of
howard
s
brigade
of
ashworth
s
and
power
s
portuguese
were
sent
to
the
critical
point
the
whole
of
the
caçadores
followed
british
narratives
persistently
state
that
infantry
of
the
imperial
guard
fought
in
fuentes
village
but
it
is
absolutely
certain
that
there
were
none
of
those
troops
with
masséna
s
army
the
explanation
lies
in
the
fact
that
the
grenadier
company
in
a
french
regiment
wore
bearskins
and
that
a
mass
of
grenadier
companies
therefore
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
guards
all
and
diaries
speak
of
fighting
with
the
imperial
guards
for
this
reason
but
the
progress
of
the
attack
had
been
so
far
encouraging
that
at
this
moment
about
noon
drouet
resolved
to
finish
the
affair
by
putting
in
heavy
supports
from
conroux
s
and
claparéde
s
divisions
for
a
final
blow
which
should
heave
the
french
line
up
on
to
the
plateau
clear
the
allied
troops
out
of
the
last
few
houses
of
the
village
and
definitively
break
wellington
s
line
at
its
projecting
point
eight
or
ten
fresh
battalions
charged
across
the
brook
in
column
through
the
narrow
streets
encumbered
by
dead
and
wounded
and
ascending
the
slope
drove
their
enemies
out
of
the
church
and
the
rocks
beside
it
this
was
the
critical
moment
of
the
day
the
only
one
at
which
wellington
lost
possession
of
the
whole
of
the
advanced
post
which
so
perfectly
defended
his
centre
masséna
s
dispatch
speaks
only
of
claparéde
s
division
as
being
put
in
but
as
martinien
s
lists
show
conroux
must
have
been
still
more
heavily
engaged
for
his
division
lost
officers
killed
and
wounded
claparéde
s
only
moreover
it
was
one
of
conroux
s
battalions
léger
with
which
the
were
engaged
mainly
and
this
battalion
alone
lost
officers
about
three
battalions
of
each
division
remained
in
reserve
and
had
few
or
no
casualties
viz
the
of
the
line
such
a
series
of
attacks
writes
an
constantly
supported
by
fresh
troops
required
exertions
more
than
human
to
withstand
every
effort
had
been
made
to
maintain
the
post
but
efforts
however
great
have
their
limits
our
soldiers
had
now
been
engaged
in
this
unequal
contest
for
upwards
of
eight
hours
the
heat
was
excessive
and
their
ammunition
was
nearly
expended
the
town
presented
a
shocking
sight
our
highlanders
lay
dead
in
heaps
while
the
other
regiments
though
less
remarkable
in
dress
were
scarcely
so
in
the
number
of
their
slain
the
french
grenadiers
with
their
immense
caps
and
gaudy
plumes
lay
in
piles
of
ten
and
twenty
together
some
dead
others
wounded
with
barely
strength
sufficient
to
move
their
exhausted
state
and
the
weight
of
their
cumbrous
accoutrements
making
it
impossible
for
them
to
crawl
out
of
the
dreadful
fire
of
grape
and
round
shot
which
the
enemy
poured
into
the
town
the
highlanders
had
been
driven
to
the
churchyard
at
the
very
top
of
the
village
and
were
fighting
with
the
french
grenadiers
across
the
graves
and
tombstones
the
french
light
infantry
the
leading
battalion
of
conroux
s
division
had
penetrated
as
far
as
the
church
and
were
preparing
to
debouch
upon
the
rear
of
our
grattan
of
the
see
his
pp
this
part
of
the
british
army
the
second
or
reserve
line
of
the
division
whose
front
line
was
nearer
the
edge
of
the
position
facing
marchand
was
composed
of
mackinnon
s
brigade
the
and
on
these
troops
devolved
the
responsibility
of
stopping
the
gap
by
recovering
the
church
and
the
head
of
the
village
the
moment
for
their
action
had
evidently
come
mackinnon
sent
for
leave
to
charge
to
wellington
by
sir
edward
pakenham
who
galloped
back
in
a
few
minutes
for
he
had
found
his
chief
only
a
few
yards
away
watching
for
the
crisis
he
says
you
may
go
come
along
was
the
prompt
reply
and
mackinnon
moved
down
with
the
and
in
column
of
sections
left
in
front
leaving
the
in
reserve
on
his
old
position
this
again
from
grattan
who
tells
how
his
colonel
wallace
of
bussaco
fame
said
that
he
would
rather
have
to
retake
fuentes
than
to
cover
a
retreat
to
the
coa
there
was
a
fearful
clash
by
the
church
at
the
mouth
of
the
village
street
between
the
the
leading
british
regiment
and
the
battalion
of
the
léger
at
the
head
of
conroux
s
column
they
met
front
to
front
both
in
column
and
are
said
to
have
fought
with
the
bayonet
for
some
moments
the
rarest
thing
in
war
it
was
only
in
a
street
combat
like
this
that
such
a
chance
could
happen
after
a
sharp
bicker
the
french
battalion
gave
way
and
turned
back
at
the
same
moment
the
charged
down
another
lane
which
led
into
the
village
and
all
the
broken
remnants
of
the
highland
regiments
and
the
light
companies
cheered
and
advanced
among
the
lanes
and
houses
the
enemy
yielded
at
every
point
seeing
their
main
column
beaten
back
and
the
advance
of
the
british
line
swept
the
whole
village
as
far
as
the
brook
some
of
the
pursuers
going
too
far
were
killed
even
on
its
further
side
it
was
impossible
to
maintain
the
houses
near
the
water
which
were
too
much
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
french
artillery
on
the
opposite
bank
but
the
and
made
a
firm
lodgement
in
the
middle
and
upper
parts
of
the
village
and
were
not
molested
by
any
further
attempt
on
the
part
of
drouet
to
expel
them
though
his
guns
made
their
position
sufficiently
uncomfortable
the
commander
of
the
corps
contented
himself
with
bringing
forward
his
last
intact
battalions
to
the
front
to
cover
the
routed
masses
while
they
were
getting
into
order
again
to
the
rear
of
their
original
position
the
attempt
to
storm
fuentes
had
failed
with
loss
and
by
about
two
o
clock
the
decisive
fighting
was
over
the
corps
had
lost
men
in
the
ferey

at
least
more
on
the
part
of
the
defenders
the
and
the
original
garrison
of
the
village
had
casualties
including
prisoners
taken
at
the
moment
of
the
first
storm
this
was
a
loss
of
per
as
they
had
officers
and
men
on
the
field
cameron
the
colonel
of
the
was
shot
from
a
house
during
the
last
victorious
charge
the
and
who
finally
recovered

by
their
decisive
charge
lost
only
men
in
doing
so
the
with
the
light
companies
and
caçadores
who
had
formed
the
earlier
reinforcements
seem
to
have
had
about
casualties
but
it
is
impossible
to
separate
the
losses
of
the
light
companies
in
the
village
from
those
of
the
battalions
to
which
they
belonged
who
were
drawn
up
in
the
main
position
and
suffered
certain
casualties
there
on
the
whole
the
defenders
of
fuentes
seem
to
have
lost
about
men
its
assailants
about
out
of
the
and
the
men
whom
they
respectively
engaged
within
it
such
is
the
value
of
the
defensive
even
when
the
fighting
comes
to
close
quarters
among
houses
and
enclosures
it
is
unfortunately
impossible
to
disentangle
the
losses
of
the
various
battalions
of
the
corps
as
there
is
no
regimental
return
but
only
a
corps
return
of
its
losses
available
but
some
aid
is
given
by
martinien

invaluable

had
evidently
considered
the
capture
of
the
village
of

as
the
necessary
preliminary
for
a
general
attack
upon
wellington
s
line
while
ferey
and
drouet
had
been
making
their
last
efforts
marchand
s
and

s
divisions
had
been
halted
before
the

of

while
montbrun

cavalry
was
facing
the

solignac
was
visible
more
to
the
rear
in
front
of
pozo

acting
as
general
reserve
the
guns
belonging
to
these
units
were
all
brought
to
the
front
and
cannonaded
so
much
of
the
british
line
as
was
visible
doing
some
little
harm
but
they
were
gradually
overpowered
by
the
six
batteries
which
wellington
had
brought
up
to
his
front
and
finally
ceased
to
fire
the
infantry
columns
of
marchand
and
mermet
also
suffered
appreciably
from
the
shot
and
shell
for
they
were
well
within
range
though
too
far
off
for
infantry
fire
to
tell
upon
them
it
is
clear
that
masséna
refused
to
attack
the
front
of
the
and
divisions
till
their
flank
should
be
turned
on
the
fuentes
side
and
since
that
necessary
preliminary
was
never
accomplished
the
frontal
assault
was
never
delivered
though
three
divisions
stood
ready
to
make
it
the
only
move
on
this
side
during
the
hours
after
noon
was
that
on
the
extreme
left
of
the
french
line
some
voltigeurs
apparently
from
mermet
s
division
were
sent
down
into
the
ravine
of
the
turon
and
tried
to
push
up
it
as
if
to
turn
the
right
flank
of
the
guards
brigade
they
were
however
soon
stopped
by
five
companies
of
the
rifles
whom
craufurd
had
left
to
block
the
passage
up
this
part
of
the
british
position
no
serious
attempt
was
made
to
reinforce
the
attack
which
soon
died
down
into
a
mere
six
guns
of
the
cavalry
fourteen
of
the
corps
four
of
the

notes
that
they
suffered
more
than
was
necessary
from
being
in
dense
masses
these
two
divisions
had
on
the
and
may
officers
killed
and
wounded
according
to
martinien
s
lists
as
the
total
loss
of
the
corps
on
both
days
was
officers
and
nearly
men
and
we
have
to
allow
for
ferey
s
loss
of
men
in
fuentes
village
it
seems
that
marchand
and
mermet
must
have
lost
at
least
as
many
more
masséna
s
account
of
his
reasons
for
refusing
to
commit
himself
to
the
decisive
attack
runs
as
follows
in
his
dispatch
to
the
emperor
the
english
general
had
united
in
his
centre
very
large
forces
and
much
artillery
i
wished
to
try
to
pierce
his
centre
and
to
drive
the
english
army
towards
the
lower
coa
the
spirit
of
the
troops
was
admirable
but
i
had
to
assure
myself
before
making
this
vigorous
blow
as
to
the
state
of
my
ammunition
for
during
the
course
of
this
campaign
i
had
seen
myself
checked
repeatedly
by
insurmountable
difficulties
it
resulted
from
the
report
which
the
officer
commanding
the
artillery
submitted
to
me
that
there
only
remained
in
the
reserve
park
four
cartridges
per
man
which
might
give
thirty
shots
counting
what
was
still
in
the
men
s
i
did
not
think
myself
in
a
situation
to
recommence
the
attack
with
such
a
meagre
supply
and
decided
to
send
all
the
empty
caissons
back
to
rodrigo
in
order
to
bring
up
more
ammunition
meanwhile
i
took
the
necessary
measures
to
preserve
the
advantage
already
gained
over
the
enemy
masséna
to
napoleon
fuentes
de
oñoro
may
the
main
it
is
clear
that
we
have
not
here
the
whole
of
the
marshal
s
motives
explained
granting
that
the
reserve
of
cartridges
had
run
low
the
troops
with
which
he
had
to
deliver
the
decisive
blow
were
precisely
those
who
had
still
plenty
of
ammunition
mermet
s
and
solignac
s
divisions
had
not
fired
a
shot
marchand
s
had
only
been
engaged
for
a
few
minutes
in
pozo
bello
with
the
two
battalions
of
the
division
which
it
had
evicted
from
that
village
it
is
true
that
ferey
s
claparéde
s
and
conroux
s
troops
which
had
made
the
successive
attacks
on
fuentes
must
have
been
not
only
exhausted
in
morale
but
very
short
of
ammunition
by
this
moment
but
why
had
not
the
attack
by
the
three
intact
divisions
been
made
before
the
troops
to
their
right
had
been
completely
used
up
clearly
because
masséna
refused
to
deliver
the
frontal
assault
till
the
flanking
movement
had
been
successful
and
wellington
s
had
been
driven
from
the
village
there
were
several
hours
about
noon
during
which
the
troops
of
marchand
mermet
and
solignac
remained
halted
in
front
of
the
allied
line
while
furious
fighting
was
going
on
in
fuentes
if
the
marshal
did
not
let
them
loose
upon
the
enemy
during
that
long
space
of
time
it
was
because
he
thought
the
attack
hopeless
the
explanation
appears
clearly
enough
in
the
narrative
of
his
pelet
the
marshal
came
to
the
front
when
this
sort
of
defile
had
become
already
impregnable
a
was
already
established
he
threw
himself
off
his
horse
and
accompanied
only
by
myself
walked
several
times
up
and
down
the
front
of
the
line
to
look
for
a
point
where
he
could
break
in
but
the
whole
position
seemed
equally
strong
the
fire
of
the
enemy
upon
fuentes
and
the
reinforcements
which
he
had
sent
into
the
village
drew
in
that
direction
the
bulk
of
the
french
divisions
everything
had
come
to
turn
upon
the
de
in
that
direction
it
was
necessary
to
force
the
village
and
the
ravine
at
its
back
where
all
the
ground
was
in
favour
of
the
enemy
the
day
slipped
by
in
vain
attacks
save
the
few
voltigeur
companies
from
mermet
sent
down
to
skirmish
with
the
rifles
in
the
ravine
of
the
turon
as
mentioned
just
above
pelet
sur
la
guerre
d
if
masséna
did
not
move
his
main
body
at
noon
when
the
british
were
waging
a
doubtful
contest
in
fuentes
it
would
have
been
idle
to
strike
after
two
o
clock
when
the
attack
on
the
village
had
utterly
failed
the
fact
was
that
he
had
staked
everything
on
the
capture
of
fuentes
and
had
seen
at
an
early
hour
that
he
dared
not
send
forward
marchand
mermet
and
solignac
till
the
village
should
have
been
taken
and
wellington
s
flank
turned
but
though
three
divisions
had
been
used
up
one
after
another
against
that
strong
post
they
had
failed
to
master
it
the
game
was
up
for
to
deliver
the
front
attack
when
the
flank
attack
had
failed
would
have
been
hopeless
the
only
chance
that
the
marshal
had
of
success
was
to
make
the
two
attacks
simultaneous
but
he
had
such
a
respect
for
wellington
s
main
position
that
he
would
not
assail
it
till
it
was
turned
it
never
was
turned
and
so
he
never
engaged
the
three
divisions
that
were
so
long
facing
it
as
a
subsidiary
reason
for
his
refusal
to
strike
home
we
must
undoubtedly
add
the
fact
that
he
had
discovered
that
he
was
too
weak
in
guns
to
make
any
proper
artillery
preparation
for
an
attack
on
the
british
centre
in
the
course
of
a
long
duel
his
pieces
had
been
overpowered
by
the
which
wellington
had
placed
over
against
them
they
were
badly
mauled
and
largely
out
of
action
by
the
moment
that
the
fighting
in
fuentes
village
was
over
if
the
infantry
had
advanced
it
would
have
been
shot
to
pieces
by
the
victorious
british
artillery
before
it
could
reach
the
crest
of
the
strong
position
where
the
battalions
lay
ranged
behind
the
illustration
fuentes
de
oñoro
may
on
the
northern
flank
of
the
british
position
where
the
division
about
fort
concepcion
and
the
division
in
front
of
san
pedro
watched
reynier
s
corps
across
the
steep
ravine
of
the
dos
casas
nothing
of
importance
happened
throughout
the
day
the
opposing
forces
were
almost
equal
each
about
strong
and
reynier
had
been
ordered
to
make
no
more
than
a
general
demonstration
all
along
his
line
to
support
the
attack
of
the
main
it
was
true
that
he
was
also
directed
to
make
a
parallel
movement
along
the
river
if
wellington
should
draw
in
towards
fuentes
de
oñoro
the
troops
immediately
opposed
to
him
but
this
was
never
done
wellington
kept
the
and
divisions
almost
in
their
original
positions
throughout
the
day
a
regiment
from
the
latter
the
was
moved
to
the
edge
of
the
plateau
at
the
north
end
of
fuentes
village
to
keep
back
any
attempt
to
turn
the
place
on
that
side
but
such
an
attempt
was
not
made
and
the
rest
of
the
division
kept
its
original
place
opposite
reynier
the
demonstration
which
that
general
had
been
ordered
to
make
was
duly
carried
out
but
amounted
to
nothing
more
than
the
sending
of
the
léger
and
two
guns
from
heudelet
s
division
to
skirmish
at
the
edge
of
the
ravine
with
the
light
troops
of
the
division
on
the
other
side
some
more
of
the
french
regiments
deployed
but
never
came
within
gunshot
the
figures
of
the
losses
on
the
two
sides
show
how
little
serious
was
the
engagement
the
léger
lost
officers
and
men
killed
or
wounded
the
light
companies
of
the
british
and
and
of
the
portuguese
caçadores
lost
men
the
division
had
no
losses
at
all
in
its
british
brigades
and
only
four
men
in
the
portuguese
line
reynier
has
been
blamed
by
some
french
critics
for
not
pushing
forward
a
pronounced
attack
but
it
is
hard
to
see
how
he
could
have
done
more
he
was
ordered
to
demonstrate
only
not
to
commit
himself
to
a
real
action
unless
the
british
should
withdraw
from
his
front
and
go
towards
fuentes
and
as
wellington
kept
men
in
his
front
all
day
covered
by
a
difficult
ravine
he
would
only
have
lost
lives
and
gained
nothing
by
engaging
the
two
divisions
opposite
him
were
numerically
as
strong
as
himself
and
lay
in
a
most
formidable
position
an
attack
would
have
been
beaten
off
while
if
he
had
manœuvred
towards
fuentes
to
join
drouet
the
division
could
have
crossed
the
ravine
and
taken
him
in
the
rear
such
a
movement
would
also
have
exposed
the

intended
for

though

ceased

thus
ended
the

of

the
fight
which
had
been
hot
and
well
contested
down
to

o

down

already
explained

men
the
french
about
the
remaining
losses
among
wellington
s
men
are
mainly
accounted
for
by
the
hustling
of
the
division
about
pozo
bello
which
cost
men
by
the
cutting
up
of
the
light
troops
of
the
guards
brigade
where
about
casualties
took
place
and
by
the
hard
fighting
of
the
cavalry
during
the
early
part
of
the
day
while
they
were
covering
the
retreat
of
the

which
they
lost

the

besides
their
casualties
in

had
officers

of
their

put
out
of
action
and
some
of
marchand
s
and
mermet
s
infantry
killed
or
hurt
partly
in
the
storming
of
pozo
bello
but
mainly
in
the
cannonade
in
the
afternoon
while
they
were
standing
in
column
facing

position

they
were
never

and
belonged
to
the
two
companies
of
the
captured
in
fuentes
de
oñoro
during
ferey
s
first
attack
undoubtedly
the
most
surprising
item
in
the
statistics
of
the
day
is
the
small
loss
incurred
by
the
light
division
during
its
retreat
to
the
british
lines
wherein
though
beset
by
cavalry
and
a
battery
of
horse
artillery
it
counted
only
casualties
but
steady
infantry
such
as
the
light
division
was
invulnerable
even
to
the
most
daring
horsemen
so
long
as
it
preserved
its
formation
in
square
marchand
s
division
shows
in
martinien
s
lists
surprisingly
heavy
casualties
considering
that
it
was
but
partially
engaged
on
the
in
support
of
ferey
and
on
the
was
only
actively
employed
in
storming
pozo
bello
it
had
officers
killed
and
wounded
which
ought
to
imply
at
least
or
casualties
among
the
rank
and
file
apparently
there
was
a
disproportionate
loss
in
officers
as
the
whole
casualties
of
the
corps
on
may
were
only
men
of
whom
at
least
were
in
ferey
s
division
only
hurt
in
the
in
the
in
the
rifles
in
the
two
caçador
battalions
and
many
of
these
were
undoubtedly
lost
in
skirmishing
not
in
the
retreat
in
squares
on
the
morning
after
the
battle
dawn

the
two
armies
still
holding
their
positions
of
the
preceding
night
masséna

not
drawn
back
and
the
line
of
his
pickets
was
still
covering

the
ground
taken

masséna
having
failed
when
the
enemy
was
maintaining
a
hastily
assumed
position
had
no
intention
of
attacking
it
when
it
was
entrenched
in
his
dispatch
of
the
he
writes
the
enemy
has
passed
the
night
after
the
battle
in
fortifying
the
crest
of
the
plateau
which
he
occupies
there
are
five
large
works
much
artillery
is
visible
and
trenches
for
the
firing
line
he
has
put
up
in
the
ravines
and
behind
the
rocks
he
has
barricaded
the
upper
part
of
fuentes
de
oñoro
village
and
villaformosa
thus
he
has
called
to
his
aid
all
the
resources
of
fortifications
against
an
attack
that
must
be
made
by
main
the
idea
of
relieving
almeida
had
vanished
from
the
marshal
s
mind
as
is
sufficiently
marked
by
the
fact
that
he
ordered
the
great
convoy
at
gallegos
which
had
been
collected
for
throwing
into
the
fortress
to
be
distributed
for
the
daily
necessities
of
the
army
which
would
otherwise
have
had
to
be
fed
by
provisions
sent
forward
from
ciudad
rodrigo
in
his
report
of
the
battle
he
states
that
his
intention
is
now
to
withdraw
the
garrison
of
almeida
if
he
can
manage
it
and
to
have
the
place
blown
up
there
is
no
prospect
of
dislodging
the
allied
army
by
a
second
general
engagement
but
by
manœuvring
an
opportunity
of
bringing
off
brennier
and
his
men
may
be
secured
the
primary
object
of
the
campaign
is
therefore
abandoned
but
the
new
secondary
object
of
saving
the
garrison
of
almeida
may
possibly
be
secured
in
this
as
we
shall
see
the
marshal
was
to
succeed
owing
to
the
culpable
negligence
of
some
of
wellington
s
subordinates
the
main
purpose
of
the
expedition
of
the
army
of
portugal
had
been
foiled
after
the
battle
the
idea
of
retaining
almeida
as
a
foothold
beyond
the
frontier
was
given
up
fuentes
de
oñoro
has
been
called
the
most
hazardous
of
all
wellington
s
fights
and
he
has
often
been
censured
for
fighting
at
all
success
is
not
always
the
best
criterion
of
a
general
s
dispositions
and
in
this
case
the
fact
that
masséna
was
foiled
is
not
enough
to
vindicate
all
his
adversary
s
arrangements
but
when
the
case
against
wellington
is
stated
by
critics
like
napier
fririon
or
pelet
it
is
necessary
to
set
forth
his
defence
which
seems
an
adequate
one
napier
blames
his
old
chief
for
accepting
battle
a
mistaken
notion
of
masséna
s
sufferings
during
the
late
retreat
induced
wellington
to
undertake
two
operations
at
the
same
time
which
was
above
his
strength
and
this
error
might
have
been
his
ruin
for
bessières
who
only
brought
cavalry
and
six
guns
to
the
battle
of
fuentes
oñoro
might
have
brought
men
and
sixteen
he
erred
in
sending
out
houston
s
division
to
pozo
bello
and
so
extending
his
line
to
an
unwieldy
length
across
ground
which
beyond
fuentes
was
suitable
for
cavalry
and
lacked
defensive
strength
by
engaging
the
and
light
divisions
on
this
he
gave
the
enemy
great
advantages
which
napoleon
would
have
made
he
took
up
a
position
which
would
have
allowed
masséna
to
detach
some
of
his
numerous
squadrons
round
his
right
flank
by
the
sabugal
and
sequeiro
bridges
to
destroy
his
magazines
at
guarda
and
celorico
break
his
communication
and
cut
up
the
transport
in
the
rear
of
the
allied
army
but
says
napier
with
an
overwhelming
cavalry
on
suitable
ground
the
prince
of
essling
merely
indicated
as
it
were
the
english
general
s
errors
and
stopped
short
when
he
should
have
sprung
the
blockade
of
almeida
and
the
siege
of
badajoz
by
beresford
to
this
it
may
be
answered
firstly
that
wellington
would
not
have
fought
if
bessières
had
brought
men
instead
of
the
two
cavalry
brigades
which
actually
accompanied
him
he
states
in
his
dispatch
to
lord
liverpool
of
may
that
he
is
prepared
to
abandon
the
blockade
of
almeida
if
the
enemy
have
such
a
superiority
of
force
as
to
render
the
result
of
contest
for
that
point
he
also
states
that
he
is
aware
that
masséna
might
be
reinforced
by
detachments
of
the
troops
under
bessières
which
would
include
some
of
the
imperial
guard
on
may
his
intelligence
through
spanish
sources
was
sufficiently
good
to
enable
him
to
know
that
very
little
of
the
army
of
the
north
had
actually
moved
if
one
or
both
of
the
guard
infantry
divisions
had
marched
for
the
frontier
a
week
before
the
campaign
began
it
is
perfectly
certain
that
he
must
have
heard
of
it
for
such
a
force
would
have
taken
long
to
advance
from
valladolid
to
ciudad
rodrigo
or
still
longer
from
burgos
to
ciudad
rodrigo
there
were
secret
agents
at
salamanca
and
most
of
the
other
towns
of
the
douro
valley
who
would
certainly
have
taken
care
that
such
a
piece
of
information
should
reach
the
hands
of
wellington
he
fought
because
he
was
aware
that
the
force
opposed
to
him
practically
consisted
of
the
army
of
portugal
alone
it
will
be
remembered
that
before
his
short
visit
to
the
alemtejo
in
april
he
gave
sir
brent
spencer
elaborate
directions
as
to
the
position
which
he
was
to
take
up
in
case
the
french
should
come
in
overwhelming
force
to
relieve
almeida
during
his
own
absence
spencer
was
directed
to
leave
the
road
open
and
to
draw
back
to
a
defensive
position
covering
the
allied
lines
of
communication
and
this
no
doubt
is
the
policy
which
wellington
would
have
adopted
if
bessières
had
brought
up
the
infantry
of
the
imperial
guard
to
masséna
s
help
of
this
the
best
proof
is
that
he
actually
followed
this
plan
in
september
at
the
time
of
the
el
bodon
fighting
when
dorsenne
bessières
s
successor
came
up
to
the
help
of
the
army
of
portugal
with
a
large
force
vii
see
above
napier
s
second
criticism
is
of
more
validity
the
placing
of
the
division
at
pozo
bello
did
extend
the
front
of
the
army
into
indefensible
ground
but
as
has
already
been
pointed
out
wellington
s
intention
was
not
to
fight
with
the
division
in
such
a
position
if
the
enemy
made
a
wide
flanking
movement
with
a
very
large
force
houston
s
battalions
and
their
cavalry
supports
were
to
guard
against
any
attempt
to
turn
fuentes
de
oñoro
by
a
mere
detachment
operating
on
a
short
circle
for
this
the
force
sufficed
that
though
it
was
assailed
by
three
infantry
divisions
and
cavalry
it
came
off
with
a
loss
of
only
men
and
assumed
the
new
position
allotted
to
it
in
due
course
is
surely
a
testimony
to
the
fundamental
soundness
of
wellington
s
tactics
flanking
detachments
must
withdraw
if
hopelessly
outnumbered
but
that
is
no
reason
for
saying
that
such
detachments
must
never
be
made
montbrun
s
cavalry
sought
every
possible
opportunity
to
act
against
the
and
light
divisions
but
had
no
success
save
in
the
one
case
where
they
caught
two
battalions
in
scattered
fragments
evacuating
a
village
even
there
owing
to
the
splendid
succour
afforded
by
the
british
cavalry
they
did
not
destroy
the
unlucky
troops
but
only
cut
up
of
them
the
moral
is
the
old
one
that
cavalry
unsupported
is
helpless
against
a
steady
force
of
all
arms
even
when
it
is
in
movement
over
open
ground
inferior
though
the
british
horsemen
were
in
number
they
gave
an
invaluable
support
to
the
infantry
which
was
never
seriously
incommoded
during
its
retreat
but
it
is
urged
the
light
and
divisions
might
have
been
in
great
peril
if
marchand
s
and
mermet
s
infantry
had
followed
montbrun
s
cavalry
with
all
speed
and
pursued
the
retiring
british
instead
of
drawing
up
in
front
of
wellington
s
left
centre
to
the
south
of
fuentes
village
masséna
seems
to
contradict
the
possibility
of
this
in
his
dispatch
where
he
says
that
the
and
divisions
of
the
corps
followed
the
movement
of
the
cavalry
much
as
it
was
possible
for
infantry
in
column
to
and
again
this
superb
movement
of
the
cavalry
was
stopped
and
our
infantry
could
the
enemy
had
the
time
to
cover
the
crest
of
his
plateau
with
several
lines
of
english
infantry
and
a
formidable
force
of
artillery
it
seems
probable
that
there
was
actually
not
time
for
marchand
and
mermet
coming
out
by
narrow
swampy
paths
from
the
woods
of
pozo
bello
and
forced
to
get
into
order
in
the
open
ere
they
could
move
on
to
catch
up
craufurd
and
houston
before
they
were
safe
in
their
appointed
positions
moreover
if
they
had
hurried
after
montbrun
they
would
have
been
making
a
flank
march
across
the
front
of
wellington
s
new
line
and
exposing
themselves
to
the
possibility
of
a
ruinous
like
that
delivered
at
salamanca
a
year
later
both
by
napier
iii
and
by
fririon
see
his
dispatch
in
the
appendix
to
belmas
moreover
marchand
s
leading
brigade
that
of
maucune
must
have
been
in
great
disorder
after
having
driven
the
british
advanced
guard
out
of
the
woods
and
the
village
and
would
need
time
to
apparently
then
on
masséna
s
own
showing
the
advance
of
montbrun
was
too
rapid
for
the
infantry
to
join
him
and
if
so
the
dismal
picture
drawn
by
napier
of
the
cavalry
and
the
light
division
overwhelmed
by
a
combination
of
montbrun
and
marchand
and
hurled
in
disorder
against
the
division
in
its
position
on
the
plateau
must
be
overdrawn
it
is
rash
to
criticize
wellington
as
a
tactician
when
as
in
this
case
he
was
moving
troops
under
his
own
eye
on
ground
where
calculations
of
time
and
pace
were
simple
if
from
his
commanding
position
on
the
edge
of
the
plateau
he
had
judged
that
the
french
infantry
were
close
enough
to
montbrun
to
give
him
effective
support
he
certainly
would
not
have
sent
out
craufurd
to
succour
houston
but
would
have
allowed
the
latter
to
make
the
best
retreat
that
he
could
towards
the
turon
and
freneda
but
wellington
evidently
judged
that
the
division
could
be
brought
off
without
too
much
risk
and
he
knew
that
craufurd
and
his
veterans
could
be
trusted
even
in
the
most
delicate
situations
no
amount
of
cavalry
could
harm
them
and
if
the
french
infantry
were
far
enough
away
the
operation
would
be
in
reality
much
less
hazardous
than
it
looked
when
once
the
light
and
divisions
had
got
to
their
appointed
places
in
the
new
line
it
is
hard
to
see
that
masséna
could
have
done
anything
against
wellington
s
front
which
was
well
established
on
a
commanding
ground
with
a
steep
slope
in
front
and
a
superior
artillery
ranged
along
the
crest
the
marshal
himself
as
we
have
seen
after
inspecting
the
new
position
in
person
thought
that
fuentes
village
was
the
crucial
point
and
had
turned
three
divisions
against
it
undoubtedly
if
he
could
have
taken
it
the
position
of
the
allies
would
have
been
much
altered
for
the
worse
but
it
was
a
very
strong
post
as
is
sufficiently
shown
by
the
fact
that
men
held
it
against
nearly
double
numbers
for
six
or
seven
hours
indeed
its
importance
may
be
compared
with
that
of
hougoumont
in
the
battle
of
waterloo
it
forced
the
attacking
party
to
use
up
a
disproportionate
number
of
men
against
an
outwork
whose
occupation
was
absolutely
necessary
as
a
preliminary
for
the
general
attack
which
was
contemplated
the
infantry
of
the
french
left
could
not
assail
the
and
divisions
with
any
reasonable
prospect
of
success
till
fuentes
was
carried
and
as
it
was
never
carried
the
attack
could
not
be
delivered
as
to
napier
s
suggestion
that
masséna
might
have
used
some
of
his
superabundant
cavalry
for
a
raid
against
the
sequeiro
and
sabugal
bridges
and
the
communications
of
the
allied
army
it
is
clear
that
the
move
was
feasible
but
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it
would
have
been
effective
the
moment
that
the
force
say
a
couple
of
brigades
got
to
the
coa
it
would
have
been
in
the
narrow
and
difficult
roads
of
the
mountains
liable
to
be
stopped
by
the
breaking
of
the
first
bridge
or
the
barricading
of
the
road
by
the
first
bands
of
ordenança
that
it
ran
against
cavalry
raids
to
the
rear
may
be
effective
in
the
plains
but
in
a
country
like
northern
portugal
they
are
of
very
doubtful
expediency
the
military
historian
will
remember
how
fruitless
in
the
end
were
all
the
brilliant
expeditions
of
stuart
and
morgan
in
the
american
civil
war
though
they
did
much
damage
to
trains
and
convoys
they
had
practically
no
effect
on
the
general
results
of
the
campaign
moreover
any
expedition
to
places
so
remote
as
celorico
or
guarda
would
have
taken
many
days
and
masséna
had
no
time
to
waste
considerations
of
supply
pressed
him
to
make
a
speedy
end
to
the
campaign
on
the
whole
napier
s
criticism
seems
unconvincing
on
this
point
as
to
pelet
s
and
fririon
s
and
delagrave
s
carpings
at
wellington
they
seem
to
be
based
on
a
radical
ignorance
of
the
force
which
he
had
at
his
disposal
he
may
be
proved
as
rash
or
as
timid
as
the
critic
pleases
if
it
is
presupposed
that
he
had
men
as
some
french
writers
assert
or
horsemen
superior
in
numbers
to
his
enemy
as
others
have
the
face
to
set
forth
if
the
allied
army
had
possessed
an
adequate
cavalry
or
two
infantry
divisions
more
than
it
actually
contained
we
may
be
sure
that
the
fight
would
have
taken
a
very
different
aspect
it
was
the
balance
of
numbers
which
forced
wellington
to
assume
a
purely
defensive
position
the
critic
who
urges
that
masséna
might
have
left
the
and
corps
alone
in
front
of
the
allied
position
and
have
marched
with
men
of
the
and
corps
on
castello
bom
taking
freneda
on
the
way
is
perhaps
the
most
unreasonable
of
all
for
he
would
have
had
the
marshal
divide
his
forces
into
two
groups
separated
from
each
other
by
many
miles
with
nothing
to
close
the
gap
this
would
surely
have
led
to
prompt
disaster
it
is
clear
that
wellington
could
have
overwhelmed
the
containing
force
or
have
crushed
the
turning
force
at
his
choice
this
plan
ignores
the
serious
chance
of
a
on
the
part
of
the
british
general
a
possibility
which
does
indeed
seem
to
have
escaped
the
imaginations
of
many
a
french
general
down
to
the
day
of
salamanca
it
was
deeply
rooted
in
their
minds
that
he
was
a
fighter
on
the
defensive
they
had
yet
to
learn
that
when
the
chance
was
given
him
he
could
be
as
formidable
on
the
offensive
pelet
thinks
that
l
excessive
supériorité
du
général
anglais
lui
donnait
le
moyen
de
tout
entreprendre
il
s
est
montré
dans

étranger
à

stratégie
comme
à

he
concludes
that
wellington
with
his
superior
numbers
should
have
attacked
the
french
centre
or
reynier
he
was

fort
des
deux
cinquièmes

it

that

about

he
was

had

had

there

up

the
main
reason
why
the

for
two

was
that
an

had
been
made
to
communicate
with

brennier
by
stealth
since

had
not
availed
by
offering
a
reward

the

only
emerging
from

got

made

before

by
creeping
on
all

though
fields
of
corn
the
dispatch
which
he
bore
to
the
governor
directed
him
to
evacuate
the
place
and
escape
as
best
he
could
he
was
recommended
to
try
a
northerly
line
and
to
make
for

bridge
of
barba

puerco
where
reynier
s
corps
was
to
be
placed
from
the
onward
by
taking

route
he
would
avoid

brennier
was
instructed
to
acknowledge
the
receipt
of
the
message
by
firing
three
heavy
salvos
at
five
minutes
intervals
from
his
heaviest
guns
at
o
clock
at
night
this
he
did
and
it
was
their
sound
which
enabled
masséna
to
retreat
during
the
dark
hours
which
followed
with
a
knowledge
that
his
orders
had
been
received
and
that
the
garrison
would
try
to
escape
during
the
next
day
may
the
and

recrossed
the

and
retired

corps
moving
later
and
taking

separate
route
marched
by

bridge
of

further
down
the

and
placed
himself
at

just
beyond

wellington
on
seeing
the
french
fall
back
to
their
point
of
starting
thought
that
almeida
and
its
garrison
were
now
his
own
and
so
they
should
have
been
if
his
subordinates
had
acted
with
common
ability
he
pushed
forward
his
advanced
posts
to
the
azava
and
the
agueda
in
face
of
the
retiring
enemy
but
sent
back
the
whole
division
to
relieve
pack
s
portuguese
in
the
task
of
blockading
almeida
general
campbell
took
over
the
command
from
pack
on
the
and
disposed
his
three
brigades
round
the
place
in
what
he
considered
a
satisfactory
and
scientific
fashion
it
appears
however
that
he
cantoned
them
for
convenience
sake
much
too
far
out
and
neglected
the
usual
precaution
of
pushing
pickets
close
up
to
the
walls
every
night
to
watch
the
garrison
during
the
dark
hours
the
regiments
were
placed
in
villages
three
or
four
miles
from
the
town
and
the
connecting
screen
of

between
them

was
determined
to
do
his
very
best
to
carry
out
the
dangerous
task
which
had
been
set
him
not
only
would
he
carry
off
his
garrison
but
he
would
leave

a
wreck
behind
him

and
of

were
employed
in
driving
mines
into
the
whole
of
the
enceinte
and
in
disabling
as
much
of
the
artillery
as
was
possible
in
the
time
some
of
the
pieces
were
merely
spiked
others
had
their
bores
choked
also
many
were
disabled
by
the
ingenious
plan
of
firing
several
pairs
of
guns
simultaneously
with
the
muzzles
of
some
placed
at
right
angles
to
those
of
the
others
so
that
while
half
the
shots
flew
outwards
the
other
half
struck
and
disabled
the
guns
against
which
they
were
aimed
the
besiegers
had
detected
that
there
was
something
odd
in
these
salvos
but
thought
that
they
were
signals
to
masséna
as
indeed
the
firing
on
the
night
of
the
had
actually
been
at
about
on
the
night
of
the
the
french
came
out
of
the
north
gate
of
almeida
in
two
columns
one
formed
of
the
battalion
of
the
line
the
other
of
the
provisional
battalion
artillery
and
sappers
who
formed
the
larger
half
of
the
garrison
which
numbered
something
over
men
the
two
columns
which
marched
close
together
parallel
with
each
other
struck
the
cordon
of
the
blockading
line
near
the
point
where
the
pickets
of
the
portuguese
belonging
to
pack
s
brigade
joined
with
those
of
the
queen
s
of
burne
s
rushing
violently
on
they
pierced
the
line
with
nothing
more
than
a
splutter
of
musketry
from
the
few
portuguese
sentries
immediately
opposed
to
them
who
were
trampled
down
or
driven
off
five
minutes
after
a
tremendous
series
of
explosions
from
almeida
startled
the
whole
of
the
blockading
force
the
mines
left
behind
by
brennier
had
worked
and
the
greater
part
of
the
eastern
and
northern
fronts
of
the
place
had
been
blown
up
on
the
south
side
something
had
gone
wrong
with
the
fuses
and
little
damage
was
done
but
the
fortress
was
effectively
ruined
brennier
should
have
been
caught
if
the
officers
entrusted
with
the
blockade
had
shown
ordinary
wisdom
for
he
was
plunging
into
the
midst
of
men
and
if
wellington
s
orders
had
been
properly
carried
out
he
could
never
have
reached
his
destination
the
main
blame
for
his
successful
evasion
seems
to
rest
on
the
shoulders
of
colonel
iremonger
of
the
queen
s
regiment
and
general
erskine
the
former
who
was
nearest
of
all
the
blockading
battalions
to
the
point
of
brennier
s
exit
merely
put
his
men
under
arms
and
sent
out
patrols
both
towards
almeida
and
to
right
and
left
they
came
back
after
long
delay
reporting
that
the
town
seemed
to
have
been
evacuated
and
that
the
french
had
apparently
got
off
to
the
north
and
were
out
of
sight
even
at
dawn
colonel
iremonger
had
made
no
movement
yet
his
battalion
of
all
the
division
had
the
best
chance
of
pursuing
the
enemy
erskine
s
responsibility
is
still
heavier
he
had
been
directed
by
a
written
order
on
the
afternoon
of
the
to
extend
the
line
of
the
division
as
far
as
the
bridge
of
barba
del
puerco
and
in
particular
to
send
the
regiment
under
colonel
bevan
to
the
rocky
defile
which
overhangs
that
bridge
having
apparently
received
the
dispatch
at
four
o
clock
he
detained
it
unopened
according
to
some
accounts
till
long
after
dusk
when
he
forwarded
directions
to
the
regiment
to
move
to
barba
del
puerco
colonel
bevan
not
receiving
the
order
till
late
at
night
took
upon
himself
the
responsibility
of
ordering
that
the
battalion
should
only
move
at
daybreak
wherefore
there
were
no
troops
holding
the
defile
at
the
critical
moment
wellington
says
to
lord
liverpool
may
sir
erskine
was
dining
with
sir
brent
spencer
at
head
quarters
and
received
his
orders
about
o
clock
he
says
that
he
sent
them
off
forthwith
to
the
regiment
which
was
stationed
between
aldea
de
obispo
and
barba
del
puerco
the
regiment
it
is
said
did
not
receive
their
orders
before
midnight
and
though
they
had
only
miles
to
march
missed
the
road
and
did
not
arrive
at
barba
del
puerco
till
after
the
vii
tomkinson
s
contemporary
comment
on
this
is
pp
of
his
diary
the
order
reached
sir
erskine
s
quarters
about
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
did
not
dispatch
the
letter
to
colonel
bevan
before
midnight
and
to
cover
himself
when
required
to
explain
by
lord
wellington
said
that
the
unfortunately
missed
its
way
which
was
the
many
years
later
in
his
with
lord
which
see
wellington
said
that
he
believed
bevan
had
his
orders
about
four
or
five
in
the
afternoon
but
the
people
about
him
said
oh
you
need
not
march
till
daybreak
and
so
by
his
fault
the
french
got
to
barba
del
napier
iii
says
plainly
that
erskine
sent
no
order
to
the
colonel
bevan
always
maintained
that
he
got
nothing
from
erskine
till
nearly
midnight
for
the
first
few
miles
of
his
retreat
brennier
was
followed
only
by
general
pack
who
had
caught
up
eighty
men
of
the
main
picket
of
the
portuguese
and
hurried
after
the
retreating
columns
after
sending
word
to
campbell
at
malpartida
of
the
enemy
s
general
direction
pack
kept
up
a
running
fire
for
several
hours
and
took
many
stragglers
and
all
the
french
baggage
but
by
the
orders
of
their
commander
the
retreating
columns
did
not
wait
to
beat
off
the
teasing
force
which
pursued
them
or
even
fire
a
shot
in
return
towards
daybreak
pack
found
himself
near
villa
de
ciervo
with
only
a
major
and
eleven
men
left
in
his
company
but
still
close
on
the
heels
of
the
french
in
this
village
there
was
a
troop
of
the
royals
watching
the
line
of
the
agueda
they
turned
out
on
hearing
the
firing
demonstrated
against
the
flying
enemy
and
detained
him
for
a
few
useful
minutes
but
fifty
dragoons
could
do
nothing
against
two
battalion
columns
however
with
the
growing
light
more
british
troops
were
seen
hurrying
up
general
campbell
on
getting
pack
s
message
had
come
on
rapidly
with
the
regiment
from
malpartida
and
was
within
a
mile
of
brennier
when
the
latter
turned
down
to
the
defile
which
leads
to
the
bridge
of
barba
del
puerco
at
the
same
time
the
so
unhappily
absent
up
to
this
moment
were
perceived
approaching
from
the
south
parallel
with
the
course
of
the
agueda
while
a
squadron
of
barbaçena
s
dragoons
and
some
portuguese
infantry
were
visible
in
a
direction
if
brennier
had
allowed
himself
to
be
detained
for
half
an
hour
longer
at
any
moment
in
his
retreat
he
would
have
been
a
lost
man
but
as
it
was
his
leading
column
was
nearing
the
bridge
before
the
british
got
within
touch
of
him
general
campbell
had
ordered
the
to
throw
off
their
packs
and
run
when
he
saw
how
close
the
french
were
to
safety
and
the
regiment
followed
by
the
which
came
up
a
minute
later
struck
the
second
french
column
just
as
it
was
descending
to
the
bridge
fired
upon
and
charged
on
the
steep
road
the
battalion
broke
and
many
men
trying
to
find
short
cuts
down
the
precipitous
hillside
lost
their
footing
and
fell
down
the
rocks
there
were
some
broken
necks
and
many
broken
limbs
while
other
fugitives
fell
into
the
river
and
were
drowned
meanwhile
a
heavy
fire
was
opened
on
the
pursuers
from
the
opposite
bank
reynier
who
as
he
had
been
ordered
kept
a
good
watch
on
the
bridge
from
san
felices
had
sent
down
three
battalions
of
the
léger
and
some
guns
to
receive
the
flying
garrison
they
had
lined
the
bank
and
were
ready
to
defend
the
defile
colonel
cochrane
of
the
without
campbell
s
orders
took
upon
himself
to
try
to
force
a
passage
through
the
covering
force
and
led
a
mixed
mass
of
his
own
regiment
and
the
across
the
bridge
and
up
the
opposite
slope
they
were
repulsed
with
loss
by
the
léger
the
casualties
in
this
rash
enterprise
were
the
only
ones
suffered
by
the
british
that
morning
and
amounted
to
eighteen
killed
and
wounded
and
an
officer
and
sixteen
men
taken
prisoners
pack
s
portuguese
had
lost
some
fifteen
men
when
their
picket

was
forced
at
midnight
so
that
the
total
casualties
of
the
allies
were
about
fifty
brennier
s
columns
had
of
course
suffered
far
more
but
it
was
a
scandal
that
a

had
escaped

states
his

in
his
report
to

out

the

taken
reynier
says
that
when
general
campbell
had
withdrawn
his
troops
from
the
water
s
edge
and
up
the
cliff
out
of
the
range
of
the
french
cannon
he
sent
a
party
across
the
bridge
to
bring
in
the
wounded
and
that
they
found
quite
a
heap
of
men
with
broken
limbs
at
the
foot
of
the
precipice
whom
they
dragged
out
from
among
the
dead
and
brought
back
with
them
there
were
some
few
english
and
portuguese
in
this
ghastly
pile
who
had
lost
their
footing
in
reckless
pursuit
of
the
flying
enemy
and
had
fallen
with
them
marbot
s
narrative
of
this
disaster
ii
errs
in
exaggerating
the
numbers
but
reynier
s
dispatch
shows
that
there
was
a
solid
foundation
for
what
might
otherwise
have
appeared
a
rather
lurid
picture
wellington
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
escape
of
the
garrison
of
almeida
was
the
most
disgraceful
military
event
that
had
yet
occurred
to
the
british
army
in
the
peninsula
and
it
is
easy
to
understand
his
wrath
campbell
had
been
warned
that
brennier
might
very
probably
attempt
to
escape
erskine
had
been
told
to
guard
the
defile
of
barba
del
puerco
the
former
kept
his
troops
too
far
back
from
the
place
and
so
disposed
them
that
there
was
nothing
directly
behind
the
cordon
of
pickets
at
the
point
where
brennier
broke
out
save
the
of
the
portuguese
he
also
watched
the
south
and
west
sides
of
almeida
with
unnecessary
numbers
for
it
was
unlikely
that
the
governor
would
choose
either
of
those
points
for
his
sortie
but
he
clearly
did
his
best
to
pursue
when
the
alarm
came
and
was
the
first
to
appear
at
barba
del
puerco
with
the
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
was
much
more
to
blame
than
his
chief
since
he
was
close
to
the
original
point
where
the
french
appeared
but
merely
collected
his
battalion
at
its
head
quarters
and
made
no
attempt
to
pursue
in
his
exculpatory
letter
to
general
campbell
he
thinks
that
he
has
explained
everything
satisfactorily
but
he
clearly
does
not
show
that
he
made
an
adequate
attempt
to
face
the
situation
which
demanded
a
rapid
pursuit
an
extraordinary
chance
happened
to
another
regiment
of
the
division
colonel
douglas
with
the
portuguese
was
at
junca
some
way
to
the
east
of
almeida
he
started
off
at
the
first
alarm
and
with
proper
military
instinct
marched
for
barba
del
puerco
having
good
guides
he
reached
the
bridge
before
daybreak
but
could
see
nothing
of
brennier
who
was
still
some
miles
away
near
villa
de
ciervo
finding
the
defile
all
quiet
and
no
french
visible
save
reynier
s
cavalry
picket
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
he
concluded
that
he
had
come
upon
the
wrong
track
and
turned
back
across
the
dos
casas
to
look
for
the
garrison
elsewhere
if
he
had
been
a
trifle
less
prompt
he
would
have
found
brennier
running
into
his
arms
this
was
sheer
bad
luck
but
clearly
the
main
blame
lay
with
erskine
who
kept
an
important
order
back
for
six
or
seven
hours
and
was
the
person
directly
responsible
for
the
fact
that
the
bridge
of
barba
del
puerco
was
not
watched
according
to
the
precise
direction
issued
by
the
colonel
iremonger
to
campbell
printed
in
of
the
vol
iii
wellington
to
lord
liverpool
vii
wellington
summed
up
the
affair
in
a
confidential
letter
to
his
brother
with
the
bitter
words
i
begin
to
be
of
the
opinion
that
there
is
nothing
so
stupid
as
a
gallant
they
the
blockading
force
had
about
men
to
watch
and
on
the
night
of
the
to
the
infinite
surprise
of
the
enemy
they
allowed
the
garrison
to
slip
through
their
fingers
and
escape
there
they
were
sleeping
in
their
spurs
even
but
the
french
got
the
two
officers
who
bore
the
brunt
of
their
chief
s
wrath
were
not
as
might
have
been
expected
erskine
and
iremonger
but
cochrane
and
bevan
the
former
for
his
attempt
to
cross
the
bridge
got
a
withering
rebuke
in
a
general
order
the
latter
found
that
his
statement
that
erskine
s
dispatch
did
not
reach
him
till
midnight
was
disbelieved
threatened
with
being
brought
before
a
court
of
inquiry
he
committed
suicide
at
portalegre
while
the
army
was
on
its
march
to
the
south
a
few
weeks
later
public
opinion
in
the
army
held
that
he
had
been
sacrificed
to
the
hierarchical
theory
that
a
general
must
be
believed
before
a
vii
counting
the
division
which
was
hardly
however
part
of
the
blockading
for
statements
showing
that
every
one
believed
erskine
to
be
the
responsible
person
see
stepney
instead
of
promulgating
the
orders
the
general
it
is
said
put
them
in
his
pocket
and
forgot
george
simmons
bevan
was
too
late
owing
to
sir
erskine
by
accident
not
sending
him
an
order
in
charles
napier
it
is
said
that
sir
wm
erskine
is
to
blame
and
next
to
him
general
it
will
have
been
noted
that
brennier
s
report
of
his
hazardous
exploit
for
which
napoleon
very
deservedly
promoted
him
to
the
rank
of
general
of
division
was
sent
in
not
to
masséna
but
to
marmont
the
prince
of
essling
had
ceased
to
command
the
army
of
portugal
a
few
hours
before
the
explosion
at
almeida
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
emperor
had
made
up
his
mind
to
supersede
the
old
marshal
on
april
and
had
entrusted
the
dispatch
to
general
foy
who
travelling
with
his
usual
headlong
speed
reached
ciudad
rodrigo
on
the
afternoon
of
may
marmont
who
declares
that
he
had
no
idea
that
he
was
to
take
over
any
charge
greater
than
that
of
the
corps
had
reached
rodrigo
two
days
before
and
had
reported
his
arrival
to
masséna
when
the
latter
entered
the
fortress
on
may
when
foy
delivered
the
fatal
dispatch
to
his
old
chief
the
latter
vented
himself
in
loud
outbursts
of
wrath
and
declared
that
he
had
been
maligned
to
the
emperor
he
accused
foy
of
having
given
an
ill
account
of
his
late
campaign
to
their
master
and
so
of
having
caused
his
fall
and
he
added
insult
to
injury
by
pointing
out
that
the
envelope
of
the
dispatch
was
torn
and
insinuating
that
the
bearer
had
picked
it
open
in
order
to
read
its
contents
on
his
journey
aghast
at
these
accusations
which
seem
to
have
been
no
more
than
the
angry
inspirations
of
the
moment
foy
wrote
a
long
letter
of
remonstrance
and
to
the
marshal
but
got
no
satisfaction
thereby
masséna
s
own
character
was
such
that
it
was
natural
for
him
to
suspect
double
dealing
and
dishonourable
conduct
on
the
part
of
others
the
reasons
which
probably
brought
about
his
recall
at
this
particular
moment
have
been
explained
in
an
earlier
chapter
they
were
the
emperor
s
verdict
on
the
campaign
of
portugal
his
lieutenant
had
failed
and
had
lost
the
confidence
of
his
army
therefore
he
must
be
recalled
masséna
had
done
far
more
than
any
other
general
could
have
accomplished
and
he
had
in
effect
been
sent
to
essay
the
impossible
his
master
far
more
than
himself
was
responsible
for
the
failure
but
this
the
emperor
could
not
or
perhaps
would
not
see
the
recall
was
now
necessary
for
the
old
marshal
s
bolt
was
shot
and
it
was
clear
that
after
fuentes
de
oñoro
he
could
not
have
got
any
more
good
work
out
of
his
army
see
foy
s
and
appendix
no
see
pp
above
his
successor
marmont
was
a
far
younger
man
aged
only
and
promoted
to
his
marshalship
so
late
as
he
was
one
of
napoleon
s
earliest
followers
and
had
seen
his
first
service
under
him
as
lieutenant
of
artillery
at
toulon
having
fought
all
through
the
italian
campaign
of
he
had
followed
his
chief
to
egypt
and
had
been
one
of
the
few
officers
selected
to
accompany
him
in
his
surreptitious
return
to
france
in
he
had
served
in
the
campaigns
of
marengo
austerlitz
and
wagram
but
not
in
the
war
of
during
which
he
had
been
acting
as
governor
of
dalmatia
it
was
his
good
service
both
as
general
and
organizer
in
that
province
which
had
won
him
his
illyrian
title
of
duke
of
personally
marmont
was
the
exact
antithesis
of
his
predecessor
in
command
he
was
no
rough
and
unscrupulous
adventurer
but
a
and
cultured
gentleman
whose
ancestors
had
served
the
old
monarchy
in
the
army
and
the
law
of
all
the
marshals
he
and
cyr
are
the
only
two
whose
writings
give
the
impression
of
real
literary
ability
his
autobiography
displays
his
character
in
all
its
strength
and
weakness
it
shows
him
brilliant
active
ingenious
and
plausible
but
absurdly
vain
and
the
spanish
chapters
of
it
form
one
of
the
best
and
most
convincing
indictments
of
napoleon
s
policy
in
the
peninsula
and
he
supports
every
deduction
by
original
documents
in
the
true
historical
method
but
he
is
such
a
admirer
of
himself
and
his
achievements
that
he
can
never
realize
his
own
faults
and
failures
nothing
that
he
ever
did
was
wrong
even
the
loss
of
the
battle
of
salamanca
entirely
his
own
work
can
be
shifted
on
to
the
shoulders
of
his
subordinates
and
he
has
no
sympathy
and
admiration
for
any
other
person
in
the
world
as
a
bitter
critic
remarked
at
the
time
of
the
publication
of
his
bulky
memoirs
marmont
is
not
only
autolatrous
but
his
autolatry
is
exclusive
and
intolerant
many
conceited
men
are
not
incapable
of
recognizing
merit
in
others
they
can
adjust
themselves
to
their
equals
and
respect
them
marmont
gets
irritated
and
angry
whenever
he
runs
against
another
man
of
parts
he
is
a
who
has
become
a
general
misanthrope
the
iconoclast
of
the
reputations
of
all
other
notable
but
marmont
s
jealousy
was
reserved
for
those
who
were
important
enough
to
be
considered
as
rivals
to
his
subordinates
and
inferiors
he
was
kindly
and
considerate
in
a
patronizing
sort
of
manner
the
diarists
who
served
under
him
speak
with
amusement
rather
than
anger
of
his
grand
airs
his
elaborate
parade
and
pomp
and
the
ostentatious
splendour
of
his
field
equipage
he
was
clearly
not
disliked
as
masséna
had
been
for
he
took
care
of
his
men
as
well
as
of
himself
and
was
not
considered
a
hard
master

prenait
du

and
rather
admires
him
for
having
nothing
but
silver
plate
with
him
when
on
campaign
the
military
capacity
of
this
clever
vain
ostentatious
young
marshal
has
often
been
undervalued
he
was
an
excellent
strategist
who
could
grasp
and
face
a
situation
with
firmness
and
rapidity
he
could
form
a
good
plan
of
campaign
and
manœuvre
his
troops
skilfully
as
was
sufficiently
shown
in
his
movements
in
june
and
july
as
an
organizer
he
can
not
be
too
highly
praised
the
way
in
which
he
refitted
the
army
of
portugal
within
a
month
of
fuentes
and
made
it
efficient
for
a
long
and
difficult
march
across
central
spain
was
deserving
of
the
highest
approval
his
weak
point
was
in
tactical
execution
when
he
had
got
his
army
to
the
striking
point
he
was
seized
with
irresolution
which
contrasted
strangely
with
the
skill
and
decision
which
he
had
shown
up
to
that
moment
in
personal
courage
he
was
the
equal
of
any
of
his
colleagues
but
he
could
not
keep
a
clear
head
on
a
battle
morning
foy
who
served
under
him
during
the
whole
of
his
command
in
spain
sums
him
up
as
follows
in
his
diary
bold
and
enterprising
till
the
moment
of
danger
he
suddenly
becomes
cold
and
apathetic
when
the
armies
are
in
presence
in
discussion
he
will
not
face
the
difficulty
but
tries
to
evade
it
he
is
a
good
estimable
and
respectable
man
but
he
himself
and
many
others
have
been
entirely
deceived
as
to
the
value
of
his
talents
he
was
never
born
to
be
the
general
of
an
army
his
face
expresses
too
faithfully
the
hesitation
of
his
mind
he
asks
advice
too
often
too
publicly
and
of
too
many
persons
a
witty
friend
said
to
me
in
marmont
is
like
mont
cenis
in
good
weather
his
brow
is
high
and
imposing
in
times
of
storm
the
clouds
wrap
it
completely
round
yet
so
mobile
is
his
imagination
that
when
the
crisis
is
over
he
forgets
all
his
indecision
and
mental
anguish
he
effaces
from
his
memory
past
facts
and
turns
to
his
profit
and
glory
all
that
has
happened
even
events
that
were
unfortunate
and
disgraceful
foy
s
note
marmont
had
commanded
an
army
corps
with
credit
he
had
even
conducted
a
little
campaign
of
his
own
against
the
austrians
on
the
dalmatian
frontier
in
so
as
to
bring
it
to
a
satisfactory
conclusion
but
he
was
very
far
from
being
fit
to
contend
with
wellington
who
was
as
good
a
strategist
as
himself
and
a
practical
tactician
of
a
very
different
class
of
merit
he
lacked
both
the
imperturbable
coolness
and
the
iron
resolution
of
his
opponent
and
the
first
time
that
they
met
in
serious
combat
he
was
found
out
and
dashed
to
destruction
meanwhile
marmont
s
first
seven
weeks
of
command
were
infinitely
creditable
to
him
he
reorganized
the
army
of
portugal
with
a
rapidity
that
disarranged
wellington
s
calculations
and
he
led
it
to
the
strategical
point
where
it
was
needed
with
great
swiftness
and
skill
as
we
shall
presently
see
the
emperor
in
the
dispatch
which
explained
to
marmont
his
duties
had
bidden
him
drop
the
organization
into
corps
on
which
the
army
of
portugal
had
been
hitherto
formed
and
send
home
the
superfluous
and
any
other
generals
whose
absence
he
desired
more
than
their
presence
such
advice
squared
with
the
duke
of
ragusa
s
own
ideas
for
he
disliked
to
have
about
him
officers
who
were
too
high
in
rank
and
seniority
to
be
his
humble
assistants
junot

at

abnormal
units
such
as

sent

to

to

marmont
reduced
the
number
of
field
battalions
to
three
or
two
and
having
filled
them
up
to
a
strength
of
men
each
sent
back
the
cadres
and
the
small
remainder
of
rank
and
file
from
the
junior
battalions
to
their
dépôts
a
fortnight
after
fuentes
there
were
not
more
than
infantry
with
the
eagles
in
the
army
of
portugal
but
there
was
a
great
mass
of
convalescents
in
the
base
hospitals
and
of
newly
arrived
drafts
in
the
governments
of
leon
and
old
castile
whom
marmont
strove
not
at
first
with
great
success
to
draw
to
himself
and
embody
in
their
regiments
it
was
hard
to
get
them
forward
when
every
officer
commanding
a
small
post
in
the
rear
detained
drafts
to
strengthen
his
garrison
and
when
the
governors
of
salamanca
and
valladolid
wanted
to
keep
as
many
recovered
convalescents
with
them
as
they
could
retain
because
their
governments
were
undermanned
but
for
reasons
unknown
the
léger
from
the
original
division
of
heudelet
changed
places
with
the
line
from
loison
s
old
division
and
went
into
the
new
division
the
cavalry
units
were
in
a
far
worse
state
than
those
of
the
infantry
already
at
fuentes
most
of
the
regiments
had
shown
only
two
squadrons
for
want
of
horses
and
had
left
behind
them
in
their
cantonments
dismounted
men
in
vast
numbers
marmont
seeing
it
was
impossible
to
find
chargers
for
them
in

far

section
xxvi
chapter
v
the
battle
of
albuera
may
soult
it
will
be
remembered
had
quitted
estremadura
and
handed
over
the
charge
of
the
troops
left
therein
to
mortier
on
march
he
received
the
news
of
beresford
s
irruption
into
the
province
and
of
the
combat
of
campo
mayor
on
march
so
that
from
the
beginning
of
april
onward
he
was
aware
that
it
would
be
incumbent
on
him
to
support
the
corps
and
to
relieve
badajoz
within
a
few
weeks
that
he
was
not
forced
to
march
back
from
seville
to
the
north
at
once
was
due
to
the
breaking
of
the
jerumenha
bridges
which
as
we
have
seen
delayed
beresford
s
advance
and
the
investment
of
badajoz
for
many
days
but
by
the
end
of
april
the
danger
had
grown
pressing
had
been
thrust
out
of
estremadura
and
deceived
by
the
movements
of
colborne
reported
that
the
allies
were
about
to
invade
andalusia
also
he
had
fallen
back
to
constantina
well
within
the
limits
of
that
kingdom
and
not
over
forty
miles
from
seville
nothing
definite
had
been
heard
of
badajoz
and
its
garrison
since
the
communications
between
that
fortress
and
the
south
had
been
cut
by
beresford
s
cavalry
on
april
though
its
governor
phillipon
was
known
to
be
a
man
of
resource
and
though
provisions
and
military
stores
the
leavings
of
imaz
were
abundant
yet
the
garrison
was
small
for
such
a
large
place
and
soult
was
not
aware
how
far
the
damaged
fortifications
had
been
repaired
since
his
departure
it
was
clear
that
he
must
strike
at
beresford
without
delay
or
the
news
that
badajoz
had
been
attacked
and
captured
might
come
to
hand
some
black
morning
the
marshal
s
situation
therefore
on
may
was
not
unlike
what
it
had
been
at
the
end
of
the
preceding
december
when
by
the
emperor
s
orders
he
had
been
directed
to
make
his
first
irruption
into
estremadura
he
must
once
more
collect
from
the
men
of
the
and
corps
a
force
sufficient
to
beat
whatever
number
of
troops
the
allies
had
placed
in
that
province
the
task
would
clearly
be
more
difficult
than
it
had
been
in
january
for
instead
of
or
spaniards
there
were
now
in
estremadura
some
besides
the
men
of
whom
ballasteros
and
castaños
could
dispose
moreover
there
was
blake
to
be
taken
into
consideration
but
the
marshal
badly
informed
as
to
the
movements
of
that
general
and
his
corps
thought
that
he
was
still
so
far
from
the
rest
of
the
allies
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
join
beresford
for
battle
if
the
attack
upon
the
latter
was
pressed
with
great
swiftness
and
decision
the
only
favourable
feature
in
the
situation
was
that
badajoz
was
now
in
french
hands
and
could
not
be
used
as
in
february
for
a
general
for
the
allies
campo
mayor
and
olivenza
would
be
of
little
or
no
use
to
beresford
and
if
he
made
elvas
his
d
he
must
first
evacuate
all
that
lay
on
the
south
bank
of
the
guadiana
the
only
alternative
for
the
british
general
would
be
to
concentrate
and
fight
at
some
point
where
he
could
cover
the
siege
of
badajoz
this
was
the
probable
course
for
him
to
adopt
and
soult
had
to
calculate
the
force
that
he
would
require
in
order
to
make
victory
reasonably
certain
he
fixed
it
at
about
men
too
low
an
estimate
as
it
turned
out
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
at
the
very
moment
when
soult
was
ordering
his
concentration
at
seville
a
dispatch
was
on
the
way
to
him
from
napoleon
at
paris
dictating
the
course
which
he
ought
to
pursue
under
the
exact
circumstances
which
had
now
arisen
wellington
wrote
the
emperor
on
march
has
only
british
troops
he
can
not
make
a
detachment
of
more
than
or
of
them
with
or
portuguese
added
it
is
necessary
to
keep
permanently
about
badajoz
the
value
of
men
of
all
arms
in
good
state
and
of
the
best
regiments
so
that
at
the
least
movement
of
the
english
on
this
side
the
duke
of
dalmatia
taking
with
him
or
men
should
be
able
to
concentrate
in
estremadura
a
total
of
from
to
men
if
this
exceptional
crisis
arises
only
a
corps
of
observation
must
be
left
on
the
side
of
granada
and
it
must
be
placed
under
the
orders
of
the
duke
of
belluno
victor
the
duke
of
dalmatia
must
keep
in
correspondence
via
madrid
with
the
army
of
portugal
and
the
army
of
the
centre
the
king
ought
always
to
keep
a
division
of
men
between
the
tagus
and
badajoz
ready
to
unite
with
the
duke
of
dalmatia
if
it
becomes
necessary
to
resist
a
movement
of
the
english
against
andalusia
but
to
arrive
at
this
result
it
is
necessary
that
the
should
be
entirely
disgarrisoned
that
all
hospitals
and
magazines
should
be
concentrated
in
seville
and
that
cadiz
seville
and
badajoz
should
be
the
only
points
to
guard
with
a
corps
of
observation
at
granada
in
this
case
the
duke
of
belluno
would
take
command
of
the
troops
at
seville
and
granada
as
well
as
of
the
force
besieging
cadiz
and
the
duke
of
dalmatia
would
only
have
charge
of
the
army
opposed
to
the
english
counting
the
division
from
the
army
of
the
centre
he
can
easily
unite
to
men
in
this
case
he
would
be
able
to
resist
even
english
if
lord
wellington
marched
against
him
with
his
entire
army
but
this
supposition
can
never
be
realized
because
if
it
happened
the
prince
of
essling
masséna
would
be
able
to
march
on
lisbon
and
the
english
would
find
themselves
cut
off
from
that
place
and
between
two
fires
memorandum
from
berthier
of
march
from
the
first
part
of
napoleon
s
calculations
it
is
clear
that
he
thought
soult
would
require
about
men
the
who
were
to
be
left
about
badajoz
and
the
who
were
to
be
brought
up
from
andalusia
they
are
increased
to
by
erroneous
addition
only
as
a
matter
of
fact
soult
in
order
to
cover
seville
and
to
rescue
victor
had
left
only
men
in
estremadura
on
march
and
of
these
were
now
shut
up
in
badajoz
but
on
the
other
hand
he
collected
from
andalusia
including
maransin
s
column
men
so
that
his
fighting
force
was
within
a
few
hundreds
of
the
named
by
the
emperor
the
spoken
of
in
a
later
sentence
would
only
be
required
so
napoleon
thought
if
wellington
came
down
to
invade
andalusia
with
all
his
british
troops
we
may
point
out
by
the
way
that
the
imperial
calculations
were
all
wrong
in
detail
as
was
bound
to
be
the
case
when
they
were
made
at
paris
on
data
many
weeks
old
wellington
owing
to
the
reinforcements
which
had
landed
at
lisbon
in
the
first
days
of
march
had
now
nearly
british
troops
he
had
detached
of
them
under
beresford
and
these
were
accompanied
not
by
portuguese
at
the
most
as
the
emperor
guessed
but
by
a
full
there
was
therefore
a
serious
miscalculation
we
may
add
that
if
wellington
had
taken
the
unlikely
step
of
concentrating
his
whole
army
against
andalusia
he
would
have
had
not
only
british
troops
with
him
but
nearly
portuguese
troops
of
good
quality
the
united
force
could
have
smashed
up
in
one
morning
s
work
the
french
under
soult
whom
the
emperor
thought
enough
to
restrain
them
but
as
napoleon
truly
observed
it
was
practically
impossible
for
wellington
to
make
this
move
so
long
as
masséna
s
force
was
still
opposed
to
him
in
the
north
it
was
only
when
the
army
of
portugal
moved
down
to
the
guadiana
in
june
that
the
british
general
concentrated
practically
his
whole
force
in
one
line
behind
the
caya
in
the
southern
sphere
of
operations
and
when
he
had
done
so
the
armies
of
portugal
and
andalusia
united
though
about
strong
did
not
dare
to
attack
him
but

that

would
suffice
to
sweep
him
behind

guadiana
even
when
he
had
the
help
of
castaños
and
ballasteros
the
force
was
collected
in
the
following
fashion
at
constantina
had
men
who
had
just
been
rejoined
by
maransin
s
column
thus
the
corps
was
once
more
concentrated
and
complete
with
the
exception
of
five
battalions
in
badajoz
and
one
or
two
more
which
soult
was
bringing
up
from
seville
when
all
came
in
the
corps
amounted
to
men
of
all
arms
the
remaining
part
of
the
expedition
was
made
up
by
requisitioning
from
victor
s
corps
and
the
lines
before
cadiz
four
battalions
and
two
regiments
of
cavalry
and
from
sebastiani

four

and
three

of

of
the
independent
division
under

which
garrisoned
the
kingdom
of

soult
took
nearly
the
whole
nine
battalions
and
two
regiments
of

the
borrowed
troops
were
divided
into
two
large
brigades
one
might
better
have
been
called
a
small
division
under
generals
godinot
and
werlé
and
three
provisional
brigades
of
cavalry
they
took
five
batteries

guns
with
them
to
add
to
the
eighteen
guns
of
and
some

the
total
force
available
came
to
just
under
men
unequally
divided
in
numbers
between
the
corps
and
the
andalusian
reserves
the
cavalry
was
very
strong
in
proportion
about

the
hussars
and

were
already
with
never
having
returned
to

were

made

of
men
for
further
details
as
to
the
composition
of
soult
s
army
see
appendix
xvi
it
will
be
noted
that
soult
had
as
in
january
refrained
from
adopting
the
general
plan
which
napoleon
favoured
that
of
abandoning
all
andalusia
save
seville
and
the
cadiz
lines
and
leaving
only
a
corps
of
observation
at
granada
it
is
true
that
the
duke
of
dalmatia
took
very
little
from
victor
and
left
the
corps
almost
intact
in
the
lines
but
sebastiani
s
corps
was
also
left
only
slightly
diminished
and
was
expected
to
hold
down
all
eastern
andalusia
instead
of
being
requisitioned
for
men
and
reduced
to
a
flying
column
as
the
emperor
would
have
wished
the
unit
that
had
been
most
heavily
drawn
upon
was
the
garrison
of
the
kingdom
of
cordova
and
the
result
of
this
was
that
as
in
january
very
few
troops
could
be
detailed
for
the
defence
of
seville
since
nearly
all
that
had
been
in
its
neighbourhood
were
summoned
off
to
estremadura
the
great
city
which
formed
soult
s
base
was
once
more
left
inadequately
defended
by
dépôts
and
drafts
and
of
doubtful
fidelity
the
marshal
had
lately
raised
some
companies
of
swiss
deserters
of
all
nations
and
these
were
also
utilized
but
the
total
left
under
general
daricau
was
dangerously
small
so
keenly
was
this
realized
that
the
governor
was
directed
to
retire
within
the
great
fortified
enclosure
of
the
carthusian
convent
if
pressed
and
all
the
military
stores
had
been
placed
in
this
immense
building
which
had
been
surrounded
with
a
bastioned
enceinte
and
armed
with
cannon
so
as
to
form
a
sort
of
citadel
the
castle
of
the
inquisition
at
cordova
in
a
similar
fashion
had
been
fortified
and
converted
into
a
work
that
could
be
held
against
any
irregular
force
and
similar
precautions
had
been
taken
at
jaen
andujar
ronda
alcala
real
and
niebla
to
provide
centres
of
resistance
against
possible
assaults
by
guerrilleros
probably
however
napoleon
was
right
and
if
the
minor
places
and
eastern
andalusia
had
been
evacuated
soult
might
have
brought
more
infantry
against
beresford
in
which
case
the
latter
would
never
have
dared
to
fight
him
and
must
have
retired
behind
the
guadiana
there
would
have
been
no
battle
of
albuera
but
on
the
other
hand
all
the
evacuated
districts
would
have
flared
up
into
insurrection
and
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
soult
could
have
reconquered
them
since
he
was
to
be
for
several
months
tied
up
in
operations
against
the
british
from
which
he
could
not
have
withdrawn
a
man
i
can
not
find
any
proper
account
of
these
compagnies
helvétiques
who
were
not
part
of
the
organized
swiss
troops
in
french
service
but
they
are
several
times
mentioned
in
narratives
of
see
for
example
lapéne
presumably
they
were
in
king
joseph
s
service
but
having
taken
another
decision
and
resolved
to
surrender
nothing
the
marshal
had
only
gathered
men
to
reinforce
the
corps
they
required
many
days
to
concentrate
and
it
was
only
on
may
that
he
reviewed
them
in
their
new
provisional
brigading
at
seville
and
delivered
an
allocution
in
which
he
announced
to
them
that
they
were
destined
to
save
badajoz
and
drive
the
british
from
estremadura
and
that
the
force
would
march
at
midnight
on
the
this
threat
did
not
escape
the
spanish
patriots
in
the
city
who
passed
the
news
on
so
swiftly
that
ballasteros
was
able
to
forward
it
to
beresford

the
afternoon
of

french
forces
joined

cantos
and
their

reached
los
santos
from
which
the
light
dragoons
retired
as
wellington
had
directed
nearly
a
month
before
in
his
elvas
memorandum
the
spaniards
made
no
attempt
to
check
the
advance
their
cavalry
withdrew
as
the
french
pushed
forward
their
infantry
were
prepared
to
fall
back
on
the
rendezvous
at
albuera
from
the
the
british
cavalry
as
well
as
the
spanish
were
in
touch
with
soult
general
long
had
been
lying
about
villafranca
and
los
santos
till
that
day
with
three
british
and
four
portuguese
regiments
he
retired
to
fuente
del
maestre
and
then
to
santa
marta
contenting
himself
with
reporting
the
successive
advances
of
the
french
to
beresford
who
was
apparently
not
over
well
contented
with
his
operations
on
this
and
the
two
following
days
and
thought
that
he
might
have
gone
back
more
slowly
and
have
compelled
the
leading
squadrons
of
the
enemy
to
deploy
and
lose
time
at
fuente
del
maestre
the
allied
cavalry
split
itself
up
madden
with
two
portuguese
regiments
covering
the
roads
to
almendralejo
and
solana
while
long
and
the
main
body
stayed
on
the
to
badajoz
via
santa
marta
and
albuera
i
can
not
exactly
make
out
on
what
day
madden
s
weak
cavalry
brigade
squadrons
and
portuguese
joined
beresford
it
was
not
with
him
at
campo
mayor
on
march
but
was
up
by
april
probably
it
joined
before
april
as
it
had
been
at
elvas
since
the
battle
of
the
gebora
for
these
movements
the
best
authority
is
long
s
journal
on
pp
of
long
s
of
his
relative
having
such
long
warning
of
his
adversary
s
movements
beresford
was
able
to
carry
out
the
concentration
of
his
fighting
force
at
leisure
there
was
still
some
uncertainty
as
to
which
road
the
enemy
might
choose
three
being
open
to
him
when
his
advance
had
reached
los
santos
viz
the
obvious
central
and
shortest
route
by
the
eastern
route
the
western
route
the
former
was
rather
circuitous
its
main
advantage
to
the
french
being
that
it
was
all
across
open
flat
country
where
their
superior
cavalry
would
have
had
excellent
ground
but
the
albuera
route
was
not
perceptibly
inferior
in
this
respect
as
subsequent
operations
showed
to
take
the
third
or
western
road
that
by
though
this
is
not
so
long
as
that
by
solana
would
have
forced
soult
to
execute
a
flank
march
across
beresford
s
front
and
what
probably
weighed
more
with
the
french
marshal
would
have
fixed
the
decisive
spot
where
the
fate
of
the
campaign
would
be
settled
nearer
to
the
point
towards
which
blake
s
army
was
known
to
be
marching
and
soult
still
hoped
to
fight
his
battle
in
that
general
s
absence
d
urban
in
his
narrative
points
out
seven
but
four
of
these
were
practically
impossible
on
the
of
may
beresford
marched
out
from
his
lines
in
front
of
badajoz
to
valverde
a
point
convenient
for
occupying
a
position
across
two
of
the
possible
roads
and
not
very
remote
from
the
third
and
least
likely
one
he
took
with
him
the
division
and
hamilton
s
portuguese
with
three
batteries
the
rest
of
the
army
remained
before
badajoz
covering
the
removal
of
artillery
and
stores
but
ready
to
come
up
at
any
moment
on
the
same
afternoon
he
had
a
conference
with
general
blake
who
rode
over
from
barcarrota
on
the
following
day
soult
s
movement
seemed
to
be
growing
much
slower
the
heads
of
his
columns
only
reached
fuente
del
maestre
and
villafranca
the
fact
duly
reported
to
beresford
that
part
of
the
french
army
had
reached
the
latter
place
which
is
off
the
main
to
the
right
seemed
to
make
it
possible
that
soult
was
after
all
going
to
move
by
talavera
real
beresford
waited
for
a
more
precise
indication
of
his
adversary
s
final
route
and
sent
pressing
orders
to
madden
to
cover
with
his
scouts
all
the
open
country
between
talavera
real
and
almendralejo
blake
on
this
day
finding
that
his
cavalry
could
discover
no
signs
of
the
french
in
his
front
to
the
west
of
the
great

in
from
barcarrota
to
almendral
as
he
promised
to
do
when
he
met
beresford
at
valverde
on
the
it
being
perfectly
clear
by
this
time
that
the
french
were
not
about
to
take
the
western
route
beresford
on
the
marched
the
division
and
hamilton
s
portuguese
to
albuera
where
they
were
joined
by
more
troops
from
in
front
of
badajoz
alten
s
german
brigade
and
a
provisional
brigade
of
portuguese
under
colonel
collins
only
the
division
and
the
spanish
brigade
belonging
to
castaños
lately
arrived
from
merida
now
remained
in
front
of
the
fortress
all
on
the
south
bank
save
kemmis
s
brigade
of
the
unit
the
last
of
the
stores
were
moved
on
this
day
from
the
trenches
to
elvas
and
the
flying
bridge
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
caya
was
taken
up
this
last
proved
a
mistake
it
was
intended
that
kemmis
should
join
the
army
by
using
a
ford
below
badajoz
which
had
been
practicable
for
the
last
ten
days
but
on
the
night
of
the
the
water
rose
and
the
brigade
was
forced
to
march
round
by
the
next
passage
that
at
jerumenha
which
involved
a
circuit
of
thirty
miles
and
made
it
late
for
the
battle
only
three
companies
which
chanced
to
be
on
the
south
bank
of
the
guadiana
when
the
freshet
came
down
were
able
to
march
off
with
cole
and
the
rest
of
the
division
when
the
order
came
this
brigade
which
appears
for
the
albuera
campaign
was
composed
of
the
line
batts
from
the
garrison
of
elvas
joined
by
the
caçadores
a
detached
light
battalion
which
had
been
serving
with
the
cavalry
south
of
the
tagus
since
last
november
see
vol
iii
this
temporary
brigade
must
not
be
confused
with
other
units
headed
by
collins
before
and
after
about
men
were
already
in
line
at
albuera
when
soult
s
intention
at
last
became
perfectly
clear
his
and
hussars
vigorously
attacked
long
s
horsemen
at
santa
marta
and
began
to
drive
them
along
the
long
made
no
stand
though
having
three
british
and
two
portuguese
regiments
otway
besides
some
of
castaños
s
cavalry
he
was
in
considerable
strength
he
was
driven
rather
faster
than
one
could
have
wished
and
retiring
precipitately
crossed
the
albuera
stream
and
gave
up
the
whole
right
bank
to
the
enemy
this
haste
is
a
bad
thing
because
the
woods
there
mask
all
the
enemy
s
movements
wrote
d
urban
in
his
diary
beresford
was
so
vexed
with
him
that
he
that
night
assigned
to
the
command
of
the
cavalry
of
the
whole
allied
army
general
lumley
who
was
long
s
senior
leaving
the
latter
in
nominal
command
of
the
british
horse
alone
lumley
though
then
in
charge
of
an
infantry
brigade
in
the
division
was
an
old
light
dragoon
and
showed
himself
next
day
well
able
to
manage
a
mass
of
mounted
men
in
a
private
letter
to
sir
taylor
d
urban
uses
even
stronger
language
our
cavalry
instead
of
retiring
leisurely
had
fallen
back
indeed
i
may
say
rapidly
before
the
advanced
guard
of
the
enemy
the
left
bank
of
the
albuera
was
given
up
without
the
slightest
attempt
at
dispute
this
error
on
the
part
of
the
officer
commanding
the
cavalry
was
so
completely
of
a
piece
with
his
conduct
upon
more
than
one
previous
occasion
that
it
became
imperatively
necessary
to
relieve
d
urban
mss
no
enemy
save
briche
s
light
cavalry
came
up
during
the
soult
s
infantry
were
far
behind
and
bivouacked
that
night
at
santa
marta
beresford
was
therefore
able
to
complete
his
concentration
at
leisure
blake
s
army
was
directed
to
march
up
in
the
afternoon
from
almendral
only
five
miles
away
cole
and
the
spanish
brigade
of
carlos
de
españa
castaños
s
only
infantry
force
were
directed
to
break
up
from
the
badajoz
lines
and
march
at
to
albuera
the
spaniards
for
some
unknown
reason
were
very
late
blake
only
arrived
at
and
his
troops
encamping
in
the
dark
could
not
take
up
the
position
assigned
to
them
till
daylight
however
he
had
arrived
which
was
the
main
thing
bringing
with
him
the
three
infantry
divisions
of
zayas
ballasteros
and
lardizabal
and
horse
under
loy
but
only
one
battery
cole
reported
that
he
would
be
on
the
ground
soon
after
dawn
but
that
kemmis
was
cut
off
from
him
by
the
rise
of
the
river
so
that
he
could
only
bring
two
brigades
instead
of
three
orders
were
also
sent
to
madden
to
close
up
with
his
portuguese
horse
but
he
could
not
be
found
having
most
unaccountably
crossed
the
guadiana
to
montijo
with
the
bulk
of
his
brigade
an
eccentric
and
unjustifiable
movement
two
of
his
squadrons
however
were
met
and
sent
to
join
otway
that
night
the
position
of
albuera
is
not
a
strong
or
a
one
yet
it
is
far
the
best
that
can
be
discovered
across
the
seville
for
many
miles
south
of
badajoz
it
consists
of
a
long
rolling
line
of
low
hills
extending
for
several
miles
along
the
brook
which
takes
its
name
from
the
village
this
stream
is
in
spring
an
insignificant
thread
of
water
fordable
anywhere
by
infantry
or
cavalry
and
allowing
even
guns
and
waggons
to
pass
at
many
points
though
there
are
occasionally
long
stretches
of
bank
with
an
almost
precipitous
drop
of
ten
or
twelve
feet
which
would
stop
anything
on
wheels
the
ground
on
the
or
french
bank
slopes
up
in
a
very
gentle
rise
and
is
covered
in
many
places
with
groves
of
olives
which
make
it
impossible
to
take
any
general
view
of
the
or
to
get
more
than
vague
and
partial
notions
as
to
any
movements
of
troops
that
may
be
going
on
in
it
on
the
or
english
bank
the
rolling
heights
are
completely
bare
of
trees
except
at
the
village
of
albuera
there
is
neither
house
wall
nor
bush
upon
them
nothing
taller
than
a
few
withered
shrubs
three
feet
high
this
account
of
the
albuera
position
was
written
on
the
spot
and
involved
a
good
deal
of
walking
on
a
blazing
april
day
see
note
at
end
of
the
chapter
the
heights
of
albuera
are
simply
an
undulation
along
the
bank
of
the
stream
which
rises
very
slightly
above
the
level
of
the
plateau
that
stretches
from
the
position
to
the
descent
into
the
valley
of
the
guadiana
thirteen
miles
away
this
ridge
or
undulation
extends
in
either
direction
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
with
varying
altitude
sometimes
only
feet
sometimes
perhaps
feet
above
the
water
s
edge
there
are
therefore
many
dips
on
the
summit
of
the
position
the
main
was
on
the
two
slopes
of
one
of
these
dips
where
between
two
of
the
higher
knolls
of
the
ridge
there
is
a
depression
perhaps
a
third
of
a
mile
in
width
the
of
the
heights
to
the
in
the
direction
of
badajoz
is
even
gentler
than
that
towards
the
albuera
stream
the
ravine
of
the
arroyo
river
marked
in
napier
s
and
other
maps
is
an
absurd
exaggeration
there
is
simply
a
slightly
curved
bottom
where
a
lush
growth
of
grass
along
a
certain
line
may
indicate
the
course
of
a
rivulet
in
very
wet
weather
this
line
has
no
marked
banks
and
is
as
much
like
a
as
a
ravine
it
would
not
even
after
rain
present
any
obstacle
to
infantry
or
cavalry
moving
in
mass
and
it
is
a
mistake
to
make
it
take
any
prominent
part
in
the
history
of
the
battle
either
napier
never
saw
the
ground
of
albuera
as
beresford
suggests
in
the
on
napier
s
or
else
he
had
forgotten
it
the
only
good
plan
available
was
d
urban
s
and
this
napier
used
a
copy
of
it
is
among
his
portfolio
of
maps
in
the
bodleian
library
memory
or
hypothesis
exaggerating
into
hills
and
ravines
the
very
gentle
ups
and
downs
shown
on
the
map
there
is
no
ravine
or
dead
ground
of
any
kind
anywhere
on
either
the
french
or
the
english
side
of
the
albuera
the
slopes
are
so
gentle
that
any
spot
can
be
seen
from
any
other
but
the
french
side
is
wooded
so
that
movements
of
troops
are
hard
to
follow
while
the
other
bank
is
absolutely
bare
there
is
however
a
on
the
english
heights
between
the
dip
where
the
main
battle
took
place
and
albuera
village
an
observer
standing
on
the
point
where
soult
formed
his
front
of
battle
can
not
get
a
view
of
the
english
line
near
the
village
to
do
so
he
must
ride
sideways
down
towards
the
water
to
look
along
the
trough
of
the
depression
hence
soult
during
the
battle
can
not
have
seen
a
good
deal
of
what
was
going
on
behind
the
allied
front
line
but
beresford
on
the
above
the
edge
of
the
dip
could
make
out
all
soult
s
dispositions
when
the
battle
smoke
did
not
hinder
him
albuera
is
a
big
village
with
a
disproportionately
high
church
tower
it
stands
on
a
knoll
of
its
own
in
front
of
the
main
line
of
the
ridge
to
which
it
serves
as
an
outwork
as
hougoumont
did
to
wellington
s
position
at
waterloo
it
is
well
away
from
the
river
bank
perhaps
or
yards
from
it
the
bridge
which
brings
the
seville
across
the
stream
is
not
exactly
opposite
the
village
but
decidedly
to
the
of
it
the
albuera
stream
is
formed
by
two
minor
brooks
the
nogales
and
the
chicapierna
which
meet
a
little
south
of
the
village
between
them
is
a
low
wooded
hill
which
conceals
from
an
observer
on
the
british
heights
the
upper
course
of
the
nogales
and
part
of
the
woods
beyond
in
which
the
french
formed
their
order
of
battle
it
was
behind
this
long
low
knoll
that
soult
hid
his
main
attacking
column
but
the
elevation
itself
is
insignificant
and
much
less
effective
than
the
more
distant
woods
in
covering
his
movement
beresford
drew
up
his
army
on
the
hypothesis
that
soult
s
aim
would
be
to
pierce
his
centre
by
capturing
albuera
village
and
storming
the
heights
beyond
over
which
the
passes
years
after
the
battle
had
become
a
matter
of
history
he
still
maintained
that
this
would
have
been
his
adversary
s
best
policy
since
the
place
where
the
road
crosses
the
position
is
the
lowest
and
weakest
part
of
the
heights
and
a
blow
piercing
the
centre
of
a
hostile
army
is
always
more
effective
than
the
mere
tactical
success
of
turning
one
of
his
flanks
which
still
leaves
everything
to
be
decided
by
hard
fighting
if
the
attacked
party
throws
back
his
threatened
wing
and
stands
to
defend
himself
in
the
new
position
the
ground
on
the
allied
right
wing
he
held
on
the
other
hand
to
be
higher
and
stronger
and
even
if
the
french
got
upon
the
crest
of
the
heights
the
range
gave
by
reason
of
its
successive
dips
several
positions
on
which
a
new
line
could
well
be
formed
i
leave
these
considerations
to
the
critic
and
am
not
fully
convinced
by
them

the
actual
moment
of
conflict
and
as
he
says
with
some
pride
not
a
man
of
stewart
s
or
hamilton
s
divisions
was
visible
and
the
only
troops
under
the
enemy
s
eye
were
otway
s
cavalry
and
the
two
german
battalions
in
albuera
who
took
over
lumley
s
brigade
when
the
latter
was
promoted
to
command
the
cavalry
that
morning
in
the
rear
of
stewart
as
general
reserve
was
cole
s
division
from
the
siege
of
badajoz
which
had
marched
at
o
clock
according
to
orders
and
reached
the
field
at
in
the
morning
there
was
some
error
in
logistics
here
for
cole
ought
to
have
been
earlier
on
the
field
he
had
fifteen
miles
to
cover
and
should
have
been
started
sooner
for
preference
on
the
preceding
evening
so
as
to
allow
his
men
time
to
rest
and
cook
on
reaching
the
position
having
marched
till
dawn
they
then
had
to
lie
down
in
formation
and
eat
as
best
they
might
for
the
french
were
on
the
move
not
very
long
after
they
came
up
the
division
as
already
mentioned
consisted
only
of
myers
s
fusilier
brigade
and
royal
fusiliers
and
royal
welsh
fusiliers
and
harvey
s
portuguese

and

with
the
other
british
brigade
save
three
companies
which
had
followed
myers
was
making
a
fruitless
march
against
time
round
by
jerumenha
with
cole
there
had
also
come
up
castaños
s
sole
contribution
of
infantry
the
weak
brigade
of
carlos
de
españa
three
battalions
with
bayonets
the
remainder
of
murillo
s
division
of
men
which
formed
the
infantry
of
the
army
was
at
merida
save
one
battalion
in
garrison
at
olivenza
the
right
wing
of
beresford
s
position
the
part
of
it
which
he
thought
least
likely
to
be
attacked
was
held
by
blake
s
men
having
encamped
anyhow
on
the
hillside
when
they
arrived
at
midnight
they
had
to
be
collected
and
rearranged
with
much
loss
of
time
after
morning
broke
indeed
they
had
formed
their
line
only
about
an
hour
before
the
battle
began
the
three
infantry
divisions
of
lardizabal
ballasteros
and
zayas
were
arranged
in
succession
from
left
to
right
each
with
one
brigade
in
first
and
one
in
second
line
the
horse
of
loy
were
out
on
the
extreme
right
corresponding
to
otway
s
portuguese
on
the
extreme
left
of
the
rest
of
the
allied
cavalry
de
grey
s
heavy
dragoons
and
horse
of
castaños
s
estremaduran
force
under
penne
villemur
were
in
reserve
near
cole
s
division
the
light
dragoons
separated
from
the
other
two
british
regiments
were
watching
the
course
of
the
albuera
from
the
bridge
upwards
in
front
of
blake
s
line
soult
had
come
prepared
to
fight
on
the
morrow
as
soon
as
his
infantry
should
arrive
on
the
field
at
nightfall
only
one
brigade
of
them
was
up
the
main
body
had
bivouacked
at
santa
marta
from
whence
they
broke
up
before
dawn
and
marched
eleven
miles
to
the
battlefield
werlé
s
reserve
forming
the
tail
of
the
column
was
not
closed
up
till
seven
or
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
marshal
was
still
under
the
impression
that
blake
had
not
yet
arrived
and
that
beresford
could
not
have
more
than
men
in
line
opposite
him
it
is
one
of
the
ironies
of
history
to
read
in
his
dispatch
that
his
great
flank
attack
which
so
much
surprised
beresford
and
caused
so
much
confusion
in
the
allied
army
at
the
commencement
of
the
action
was
made
with
the
intention
of
cutting
in
between
beresford
and
blake
whom
he
believed
to
be
still
on
the
march
from
the
direction
of
almendral
some
miles
to
the
south
the
spanish
army
having
arrived
after
dark
had
never
been
seen
and
at
beresford
s
request
blake
had
ranged
it
behind
the
on
the
crest
so
that
nothing
was
visible
save
loy
s
horse
far
on
the
right
soult
thought
these
were
penne
villemur
s
squadrons
belonging
to
castaños
which
had
been
accompanying
the
british
cavalry
for
some
days
in
his
dispatch
to
berthier
written
before
leaving
seville
he
spoke
confidently
of
cutting
in
ahead
of
blake
and
surmised
that
the
latter
would
find
himself
in
a
very
compromising
position
when
he
arrived
in
southern
estremadura
on
learning
that
beresford
had
already
been
driven
across
the
guadiana
on
the
spies
brought
him
the
statement
that
blake
was
timed
to
join
beresford
only
on
the
his
distinctly
says
that
his
first
news
of
the
junction
having
already
taken
place
was
got
from
prisoners
during
the
course
of
the
action
the
marshal
could
make
out
very
little
of
his
enemy
s
force
or
position
all
that
could
be
guessed
was
that
otway
s
and
loy
s
cavalry
both
well
visible
covered
the
two
ends
of
the
line
soult
s
scheme
of
attack
was
ingenious
though
founded
on
an
utterly
wrong
hypothesis
he
resolved
to
demonstrate
with
one
infantry
and
one
cavalry
brigade
against
the
village
of
albuera
so
as
to
attract
his
enemy
s
attention
to
his
centre
while
carrying
the
rest
of
his
army
far
to
the
left
under
cover
of
the
woods
and
the
low
hill
between
the
nogales
and
chicapierna
brooks
to
a
point
from
which
they
could
turn
beresford
s
right
by
crossing
the
two
streams
and
ascending
the
plateau
somewhere
beyond
the
point
where
loy
s
cavalry
were
visible
the
details
of
the
execution
of
this
plan
were
very
well
worked
out
godinot
s
brigade
the
muskets
of
the
léger
and
ligne
marched
upon
albuera
flanked
by
briche
s
light
cavalry
and
supported
by
the
fire
of
two
batteries
they
became
at
once
hotly
engaged
with
alten
s
german
battalions
and
with
two
battalions
of
spaniards
whom
blake
sent
down
to
give
the
village
flank
support
a
portuguese
battery
above
the
village
swept
the
approaches
to
the
bridge
very
effectively
meanwhile
on
godinot
s
left
soult
showed
two
brigades
of
dragoons
and
werlé
s
strong
brigade
of
men
drawn
up
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
apparently
about
to
attack
blake
s
line
in
front
but
deep
in
the
olives
to
the
left
the
two
divisions
of
the
corps
girard
and
gazan
were
executing
a
circular
sweep
with
a
cavalry
brigade
in
front
of
them
quite
out
of
sight
they
were
covered
not
only
by
the
trees
but
by
the
height
between
the
nogales
and
chicapierna
brooks
the
battery
was
that
of
captain
arriaga
beresford
and
blake
prepared
to
resist
an
attack
on
their
centre
and
right
and
felt
reasonably
confident
of
giving
a
good
account
of
themselves
but
the
frontal
attack
seemed
somehow
to
hang
fire
and
suddenly
a
new
development
came
four
regiments
of
french
cavalry
far
to
the
right
galloped
out
of
the
woods
across
the
two
brooks
and
up
the
slopes
far
beyond
beresford
s
right
loy
s
spanish
cavalry
who
lay
in
that
direction
naturally
gave
way
before
them
immediately
afterwards
the
head
of
a
long
infantry
column
came
marching
up
from
the
same
point
making
for
the
heights
at
a
place
some
way
beyond
blake
s
extreme
right
it
is
curious
to
note
that
they
did
not
aim
at
attacking
blake
s
actual
flank
but
rather
at
getting
on
top
of
the
heights
beyond
him
so
as
to
be
able
to
move
against
him
on
the
level
of
the
plateau
without
having
to
climb
the
hill
in
face
of
opposition
beresford
rode
hastily
along
the
line
to
meet
blake
and
requested
him
to
deal
with
this
unexpected
flank
attack
by
drawing
off
one
of
his
two
lines
and
placing
it
at
right
angles
to
the
original
position
across
the
summit
of
the
heights
he
himself
would
take
care
of
the
frontal
attack
blake
promised
to
do
this
but
sent
only
one
brigade
of
zayas
s
division
four
battalions
and
his
only
battery
to
execute
the
required
movement
he
was
still
not
convinced
that
the
front
attack
might
not
be
the
main
one
beresford
meanwhile
went
back
to
his
own
troops
to
direct
stewart
s
division
to
prepare
to
support
the
spaniards
when
necessary
and
lumley
s
cavalry
to
move
off
to
join
loy
on
the
extreme
right
the
next
served
to
develop
the
whole
face
of
the
battle
in
its
second
aspect
the
french
cavalry
at
the
head
of
the
turning
column
spread
themselves
out
on
the
rolling
plateau
to
the
west
of
the
heights
so
as
to
flank
their
infantry
the
corps
formed
itself
in
a
column
of
extraordinary
depth
on
the
undulating
summit
of
the
ridge
and
began
to
move
on
toward
blake
s
flank
the
responsibility
for
the
order
of
battle
adopted
must
apparently
be
laid
on
the
shoulders
of
girard
the
senior
who
was
placed
that
day
at
the
head
of
the
whole
corps
who
had
led
it
during
the
last
two
months
had
been
taken
away
to
assume
general
charge
of
the
cavalry
girard
as
it
seems
intended
to
beat
down
the
hastily
formed
line
of
defence
which
the
spaniards
were
opposing
to
him
by
the
impetus
of
an
immensely
heavy
column
his
force
consisted
of
two
divisions
each
of
two
brigades
and
each
brigade
composed
of
from
four
to
six
battalions
i
had
long
sought
for
an
exact
description
of
his
array
of
which
the
french
historians
and
soult
s
dispatch
only
say
that
it
was
a
serrée
de
at
last
i
found
the
required
information
in
the
paris
archives
in
the
shape
of
an
anonymous
criticism
on
soult
s
operations
drawn
up
apparently
for
napoleon
s
eye
by
some
officer
who
had
been
set
to
write
a
report
on
the
causes
of
the
loss
of
the
battle
the
difference
in
strength
was
caused
by
the
fact
that
two
brigades
had
contributed
two
and
one
other
brigade
one
battalion
each
to
the
garrison
of
badajoz
those
at
the
war
ministry
not
the
this
document
says
that
the
line
of
attack
was
formed
by
a
brigade
in
column
of
attack
a
column
formed
of
four
battalions
in
column
of
double
companies
one
battalion
behind
the
other
to
the
right
and
left
the
front
line
was
in
a
mixed
formation
that
is
to
say
on
each
side
of
the
central
column
was
a
battalion
deployed
in
line
and
on
each
of
the
two
outer
sides
of
the
deployed
battalions
was
a
battalion
or
a
regiment
in
column
so
that
at
each
end
the
line
was
composed
of
a
column
ready
to
form
square
in
case
the
hostile
cavalry
should
try
to
fall
upon
one
of
our
flanks
which
was
hardly
likely
since
our
own
cavalry
was
immensely
superior
to
it
in
this
formation
disposed
of
the
nine
battalions
of
girard
s
division
which
as
we
see
advanced
with
a
front
consisting
of
three
battalions
in
column
and
two
in
line
gazan
s
the
division
of
the
corps
followed
very
close
behind
girard
the
four
regiments
each
in
column
with
their
two
or
three
battalions
one
behind
the
other
the
division
had
been
intended
to
attack
as
an
independent
supporting
line
but
ultimately
worked
up
so
close
to
the
division
that
it
could
not
easily
be
drawn
off
or
disentangled
and
to
the
allies
the
whole
men
looked
like
one
vast
column
with
a
front
of
about
men
only
which
allowing
for
battalion
intervals
just
stretched
across
the
top
level
of
the
heights
which
is
here
about
yards
broad
three
batteries
of
field
artillery
belonging
to
the
corps
accompanied
the
division
a
fourth
of
horse
artillery
was
with
the
cavalry
which
covered
the
left
flank
of
the
column
two
more
were
in
company
with
werlé
s
brigade
the
remaining
two
stopped
with
godinot
opposite
albuera
when
blake
realized
the
strength
of
the
turning
force
he
began
to
detach
more
troops
from
his
front
line
to
strengthen
zayas
whose
four
battalions
would
obviously
be
no
more
than
a
mouthful
for
the
corps
they
went
in
haste
four
battalions
from
ballasteros
two
from
lardizabal
but
failed
to
reach
zayas
before
the
fighting
began
meanwhile
a
majestic
movement
changed
the
whole
aspect
of
the
french
front
the
two
brigades
of
dragoons
which
had
hitherto
formed
the
french
wheeled
into
column
of
squadrons
and
galloped
off
in
beautiful
order
along
the
side
of
the
albuera
brook
till
they
reached
the
corps
passing
behind
it
they
joined
the
cavalry
on
its
left
which
now
became
strong
was
with
them
in
person
at
the
same
moment
werlé
s
infantry
performed
a
slower
and
shorter
circular
march
and
joined
the
rear
of
the
corps
to
which
they
now
acted
as
a
reserve
thus
soult
had
all
his
infantry
save
godinot
s
brigade
of
men
and
all
his
cavalry
save
briche
s
two
regiment
of
light
horse
sabres
massed
opposite
blake
s
new
refused
right
flank
the
sight
of
this
sweep
to
the
south
on
the
part
of
the
french
caused
beresford
to
make
a
complete
change
in
his
disposition
the
whole
division
one
brigade
following
the
other
in
the
order
marched
along
the
top
of
the
heights
to
reinforce
zayas
hamilton
s
portuguese
were
to
move
in
to
take
up
the
ground
evacuated
by
the
division
lastly
cole
s
division
myers
s
british
and
harvey
s
portuguese
brigades
forming
the
reserve
were
moved
a
full
mile
to
the
right
and
placed
behind
the
english
and
spanish
cavalry
facing
s
great
mass
of
horse
it
was
the
sight
of
these
eight
solid
battalions
in
column
ready
to
form
square
which
alone
prevented
the
french
cavalry
general
from
ordering
a
general
charge
upon
the
allied
horse
in
his
front
whom
he
outnumbered
in
the
proportion
of
three
to
two
and
of
whom
only
de
grey
s
sabres
were
british
for
the
light
dragoons
the
third
regiment
in
the
field
was
covering
the
other
wing
of
the
new
front
down
by
the
albuera
stream
zayas
s
spaniards
having
a
much
shorter
way
to
move
than
the
french
turning
column
were
in
line
of
battle
long
before
the
corps
came
up
against
them
but
the
reinforcements
tardily
sent
by
blake
were
still
coming
up
and
forming
on
zayas
s
flanks
in
much
confusion
when
the
fighting
began
most
of
them
prolonged
the
line
down
the
slope
of
the
heights
above
the
chicapierna
brook
beresford
was
personally
occupied
in
posting
and
aligning
them
at
the
moment
of
the
first
clash
zayas
whose
behaviour
all
through
the
day
was
most
creditable
had
found
a
very
good
point
at
which
to
draw
up
his
brigade
and
battery
the
summit
of
the
heights
is
not
level
but
undulating
he
had
chosen
the
deepest
dip
in
their
summit
about
a
mile
to
the
south
of
albuera
village
and
drew
up
his
small
force
in
line
on
the
hither
side
of
it
so
that
the
enemy
had
to
attack
him
slightly
uphill
his
four
battalions
exactly
occupied
the
top
of
the
plateau
the
troops
under
ballasteros
which
were
now
coming
up
were
not
on
the
top
but
on
the
descending
slope
towards
the
stream
girard
s
two
divisions
advancing
along
the
summit
had
a
front
about
equal
to
that
of
zayas
but
four
times
as
deep
opposite
the
rest
of
the
spanish
line
ballasteros
s
battalions
they
sent
out
nothing
but
skirmishers
but
girard
s
division
with
a
line
of
in
front
descended
their
own
side
of
the
dip
and
then
began
to
ascend
that
occupied
by
the
spaniards
when
they
had
reached
a
point
on
the
gentle
about
sixty
yards
from
the
spaniards
the
french
cleared
off
to
right
and
left
and
the
battalions
behind
them
began
to
open
up
their
fire
slowly
advancing
between
each
volley
the
musketry
was
hot
and
both
sides
were
falling
freely
when
the
first
british
troops
arrived
on
the
these
were
the
four
battalions
of
colborne
s
brigade
at
the
head
of
the
division
the
and
counting
in
that
order
from
right
to
left
with
them
was
the
divisional
commander
william
stewart
beresford
in
his
account
of
the
battle
says
that
he
had
intended
to
draw
up
the
whole
division
in
a
single
line
in
support
of
zayas
and
to
advance
with
it
against
the
french
when
all
was
in
order
but
william
stewart
though
he
had
received
no
order
to
attack
and
had
been
only
directed
to
support
the
spaniards
took
upon
himself
to
assume
the
offensive
the
position
indeed
was
rather
a
tempting
one
the
enemy
was
engaged
with
zayas
on
an
equal
front
and
had
no
flank
guard
of
any
kind
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
he
could
obviously
be
assailed
at
great
advantage
by
a
force
which
should
pass
round
and
through
zayas
s
right
and
place
itself
perpendicular
to
girard
s
long
unprotected
flank
this
movement
stewart
took
upon
himself
to
execute
as
each
of
the
battalions
of
the
brigade
came
up
it
was
extended
and
sent
forward
apparently
in
a
sort
of
échelon
the
buffs
leading
far
to
the
flank
and
the
and
passing
actually
through
zayas
s
right
battalions
but
the
the
left
regiment
had
not
come
up
or
deployed
when
the
other
three
went
forward
into
action
along
with
colborne
there
was
coming
up
cleeves
s
battery
of
the
king
s
german
legion
the
leading
four
guns
got
into
action
just
to
zayas
s
front
at
the
same
moment
that
the
british
infantry
went
forward
beresford
suggests
that
colborne
asked
stewart
to
allow
him
to
put
the
right
wing
of
the
buffs
into
square
or
column
so
as
to
protect
the
flank
of
the
brigade
but
that
stewart
refused
colborne
s
short
letter
on
the
battle
does
not
say
so
but
as
he
was
on
very
friendly
terms
with
stewart
he
may
have
refrained
from
writing
the
fact
he
only
says
that
the
order
of
attack
adopted
was
not
his
and
that
he
had
no
responsibility
for
it
see
beresford
s
strictures
on
vol
iii
the
french
column
thus
unexpectedly
attacked
in
flank
both
by
artillery
and
infantry
fire
was
naturally
thrown
into
dreadful
confusion
the
two
battalions
in
column
which
formed
its
left
section
faced
outwards
and
opened
a
rolling
fire
three
deep
the
front
rank
kneeling
but
they
could
not
stand
the
volleys
poured
into
them
from
a
distance
of
sixty
paces
and
soon
began
to
break
the
men
were
seen
trying
to
go
to
the
rear
and
the
officers
beating
them
back
with
their
swords
colborne
s
line
cheered
and
went
forward
to
complete
its
victory
with
the
bayonet
at
this
moment
a
dreadful
catastrophe
occurred
had
been
watching
the
struggle
on
the
hillside
before
him
and
when
he
saw
it
going
badly
for
his
friends
directed
his
nearest
cavalry
regiments
which
chanced
to
be
the
lancers
of
the
vistula
and
the
hussars
to
charge
along
the
slopes
against
the
exposed
outer
flank
of
colborne
s
brigade
at
this
moment
the
morning
which
had
been
fair
at
first
but
had
been
growing
darker
every
hour
was
disturbed
by
a
blinding
shower
of
rain
and
hail
coming
from
the
north
it
is
said
to
have
been
largely
in
consequence
of
this
accident
that
the
approach
of
the
horsemen
was
unnoticed
by
any
of
the
british
infantry
but
colborne
s
men
were
also
smothered
in
their
own
smoke
and
entirely
concentrated
on
the
work
before
them
at
any
rate
the
charge
took
the
buffs
in
flank
rolled
them
up
and
then
swept
down
the
back
of
the
other
two
battalions
and
on
to
cleeves
s
battery
it
is
hardly
exaggeration
to
say
that
colborne
s
three
leading
battalions
were
annihilated
in
five
minutes
officers
out
of
men
out
of
were
slain
wounded
or
captured
the
number
of
killed
was
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
wounded
in
the
buffs
there
were
dead
to
hurt
this
ghastly
slaughter
is
said
to
have
been
due
to
the
fact
that
the
savage
polish
lancers
not
only
refused
to
accept
surrender
from
the
unhappy
infantry
but
deliberately
speared
the
wounded
as
they
lay
nor
can
i
refuse
credit
to
the
general
statement
of
contemporary
british
authorities
after
reading
the
journal
of
major
brooke
commanding
the
who
relates
how
after
he
had
surrendered
and
was
being
taken
to
the
rear
by
two
french
infantry
soldiers
a
pole
rode
up
to
him
and
deliberately
cut
him
down
after
which
the
ruffian
made
his
horse
trample
over
him
and
left
him
for
dead
in
the
regimental
annals
of
the
two
officers
are
named
as
having
been
wounded
by
the
lance
while
already
disabled
and
lying
on
the
ground
peninsular
tradition
tells
that
the
division
after
albuera
swore
to
give
no
quarter
to
poles
i
published
major
brooke
s
diary
in
for
with
an
account
of
his
almost
miraculous
subsequent
escape
from
seville
under
the
title
of
a
prisoner
of
see
of
the
in
cannon
s
series
but
not
all
the
victorious
horsemen
were
so
inhumane
prisoners
many
wounded
were
driven
off
to
the
french
lines
the
brigade
lost
five
of
its
six
colours
and
the
four
guns
of
cleeves
s
battery
which
had
accompanied
it
were
captured
only
one
howitzer
however
was
dragged
off
by
the
victors
the
other
three
were
left
behind
for
want
of
horses
the
somewhat
to
the
left
rear
of
its
comrades
had
time
to
form
square
and
beat
off
without
difficulty
the
rush
of
the
remnant
of
the
lancers
who
got
so
far
as
its
position
marking
too
late
the
awful
catastrophe
on
his
left
general
lumley
sent
two
squadrons
of
the
dragoons
to
fall
upon
the
flank
and
rear
of
the
poles
but
they
were
intercepted
by
a
french
hussar
regiment
which
sent
out
to
cover
the
retreat
of
the
lancers
and
were
beaten
back
with
the
loss
of
both
their
squadron
leaders
wounded
and
taken
prisoners
napier
is
quite
wrong
in
saying
that
this
small
diversion
was
successful
iii
the
prisoners
were

illustration
albuera
nº
about
the
front
line
of
the
french
attacking
force
is
not
correctly
represented
it
consisted
of
a
column
of
four
battalions
in
the
centre
flanked
by
two
deployed
battalions
and
with
battalions
in
column
placed
outside
the
two
deployed
battalions
on
either
side
see
in
the
french

there
should
be
only
two
not
three
battalions
of
grenadiers
the
right
flank
of
zayas
s
line
is
two
battalions
too
long
it
may
be
remarked
that
the
loss
of
the
victorious
cavalry
was
very
heavy
though
not
out
of
proportion
to
their
success
the
lancers
lost
men
out
of
the
hussars
who
charged
in
support
of
them
out
of
it
was
a
curious
evidence
of
the
headlong
nature
of
their
charge
that
some
scores
of
the
poles
after
passing
by
and
failing
to
break
the
square
of
the
actually
rode
down
the
rear
of
zayas
s
spanish
line
sweeping
aside
that
general
and
his
staff
and
coming
into
collision
soon
after
with
beresford
and
his
the
marshal
actually
parried
a
and
cast
the
man
who
dealt
it
from
his
saddle
and
his
had
to
fight
for
their
lives
at
this
moment
the
head
of
hoghton
s
brigade
was
just
coming
up
from
the
rear
and
its
leading
regiment
opening
fire
on
the
scattered
lancers
shot
a
great
many
men
of
the
rear
rank
of
zayas
s
spaniards
in
the
back
notwithstanding
this
and
to
their
eternal
credit
the
spaniards
did
not
break
and
continued
their
frontal
contest
with
girard
s
division
which
had
not
slackened
for
a
moment
during
colborne
s
disastrous
fight
the
writer
of
the
on
napier
s
vol
iii
gives
as
an
the
following
anecdote
as
a
spanish
soldier
in
the
ranks
close
to
the
marshal
was
looking
to
the
rear
a
officer
in
that
service
cried
to
him
is
not
the
day
to
fly
when
you
are
fighting
as
the
comrades
of
the
the
poor
fellow
replied
no
señor
mas
los
ingleses
nos
tiraron
por
the
spanish
never
at
any
moment
fired
into
the
british
as
napier
asserts
the
mistake
was
remedied
by
beresford
s
arbuthnot
who
rode
at
great
risk
along
the
front
of
the
and
stopped
their
fire
there
was
a
distinct
pause
however
in
the
battle
after
this
bloody
episode
the
leading
division
of
french
infantry
had
been
so
much
shaken
and
driven
into
disorder
by
colborne
s
momentary
pressure
on
their
flank
that
the
whole
column
had
lost
its
impetus
and
stood
wavering
below
the
spanish
line
girard
regarding
his
own
division
as
practically
a
spent
force
ordered
up
gazan
s
two
brigades
to
relieve
it
there
was
fearful
confusion
while
the
new
columns
were
thrusting
their
way
to
the
front
and
they
were
never
properly
formed
for
the
rest
of
the
battle
the
two
divisions
formed
a
dense
mass
of
men
which
looked
like
one
solid
clump
without
much
vestige
of
regular
formation
while
this
confused
change
of
was
being
carried
out
by
the
french
beresford
had
leisure
to
deploy
hoghton
s
brigade
in
the
rear
of
zayas
and
abercrombie
s
in
rear
of
ballasteros
lower
down
the
slope
he
then
proceeded
to
bring
them
forward
to
relieve
the
spaniards
the
latter
it
is
due
to
them
to
explain
had
behaved
extremely
well
beresford
bears
witness
that
zayas
s
four
battalions
on
the
edge
of
the
undulation
which
marked
the
front
of
battle
did
not
even
to
the
end
break
their
line
or
quit
the
field
as
napier
alleges
after
having
suffered
very
considerable
loss
they
began
to
crowd
together
in
groups
and
it
was
then
that
the
second
line
hoghton
and
abercrombie
was
ordered
the
losses
of
the
two
battalions
of
irlanda
and
the
and
spanish
guards
were
indeed
the
best
testimonial
to
their
good
service
they
had
officers
and
men
killed
and
wounded
out
of
present
over
per
all
lost
by
musketry
or
artillery
fire
without
a
foot
of
ground
having
been
yielded
in
a
close
struggle
that
had
lasted
over
an
hour
with
the
coming
up
of
gazan
s
division
on
one
side
and
of
hoghton
s
and
abercrombie
s
brigades
on
the
other
the
second
stage
of
the
battle
was
reached
the
clash
was
confined
to
the
top
of
the
plateau
the
french
having
only
a
skirmishing
line
opposite
abercrombie
on
the
slope
though
the
central
backbone
of
the
ridge
was
crowded
with
their
dense
columns
hence
it
may
be
said
that
for
the
next
hoghton
s
men
assisted
by
the
the
sole
survivors
of
colborne
s
brigade
alone
were
fighting
the
entire
corps
a
line
of
men
two
deep
opposed
to
a
mass
of
twelve
deep
on
an
equal
front
this
was
the
hardest
and
most
splendid
fighting
done
that
day
not
even
excepting
the
glorious
advance
of
the
fusiliers
half
an
hour
later
the
three
battalions
and
absolutely
died
in
line
without
yielding
an
inch
their
losses
speak
for
themselves
officers
and
men
killed
and
wounded
out
of
officers
and
men
present
the
best
account
of
this
part
of
the
action
that
i
know
is
in
the
reminiscences
of
moyle
sherer
of
the
it
was
here
that
the
earned
the
nickname
of
the
from
their
splendid
answer
to
colonel
inglis
s
adjuration
when
we
arrived
near
the
retiring
spaniards
and
formed
our
line
to
advance
through
them
towards
the
enemy
a
very
young
spanish
officer
rode
up
to
me
and
begged
me
with
a
sort
of
proud
anxiety
to
take
notice
that
his
countrymen
were
ordered
to
retire
not
flying
just
as
our
line
had
entirely
cleared
the
spaniards
the
smoke
of
battle
was
for
one
moment
blown
aside
by
the
slackening
of
the
fire
and
gave
to
our
view
the
french
grenadier
caps
their
arms
and
the
whole
aspect
of
their
frowning
masses
it
was
a
grand
but
a
momentary
sight
a
heavy
atmosphere
of
smoke
enveloped
us
and
few
objects
could
be
discerned
at
all
none
distinctly
the
best
soldier
can
make
no
calculation
of
time
if
he
be
in
the
heat
of
an
engagement
but
this
murderous
contest
of
musketry
lasted
long
at
intervals
a
shriek
or
a
groan
told
that
men
were
falling
around
me
but
it
was
not
always
that
the
tumult
of
the
contest
suffered
me
to
catch
individual
sounds
the
constant
feeling
to
the
centre
and
the
gradual
diminution
of
our
front
more
truly
bespoke
the
havock
of
death
we
were
the
whole
time
progressively
advancing
upon
and
shaking
the
enemy
as
we
moved
slowly
but
ever
a
little
in
advance
our
own
killed
and
wounded
lay
behind
us
we
arrived
among
those
of
the
spaniards
who
had
fallen
in
the
first
onset
then
among
those
of
the
enemy
at
last
we
were
only
twenty
yards
from
their
the
brigade
had
lost
nearly
of
its
numbers
the
brigadier
had
been
killed
of
the
three
battalion
commanders
one
was
killed
and
two
wounded
the
front
of
the
shrinking
line
no
longer
covered
that
of
the
french
mass
before
it
but
the
enemy
was
in
no
condition
to
profit
by
the
exhaustion
of
the
british
the
fire
of
the
line
had
as
always
been
more
effective
than
that
of
the
column
the
front
of
the
enemy
was
one
deep
bank
of
dead
and
wounded
the
corps
lost
men
that
day
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
of
them
fell
during
this
murderous
exchange
of
musketry
meanwhile
it
is
strange
to
find
that
both
commanders
allowed
this
duel
of
the
many
against
the
few
on
the
plateau
to
go
on
undisturbed
soult
had
still
eleven
battalions
intact
in
reserve
werlé
s
brigade
and
two
battalions
of
his
cavalry
was
also
doing
nothing
save
observe
lumley
s
much
inferior
force
beresford
had
still
of
intact
troops
the
division
the
three
brigades
of
hamilton
s
and
collins
s
portuguese
and
the
spaniards
who
had
remained
on
their
original
position
none
of
those
forces
on
either
side
were
being
utilized
during
the
crisis
of
the
battle
the
explanation
is
to
be
found
in
the
narratives
of
the
two
hostile
generals
soult
says
in
his
dispatch
to
the
emperor
when
i
ascended
the
heights
at
the
moment
that
the
enemy
s
second
line
advanced
and
began
to
press
in
our
front
i
was
surprised
to
notice
their
great
numbers
immediately
afterwards
i
learned
from
a
spanish
prisoner
that
blake
had
already
joined
beresford
so
that
i
had
men
to
deal
with
the
odds
were
not
fair
and
i
resolved
at
once
to
give
up
my
original
project
and
to
aim
at
nothing
more
than
retaining
the
ground
already
the
marshal
therefore
changed
his
plan
from
an
offensive
to
a
defensive
battle
and
refused
to
engage
his
reserves
or
to
bid
his
cavalry
charge
a
most
resolve
as
to
beresford
he
was
anxious
to
succour
hoghton
but
he
did
not
wish
to
move
the
division
which
he
thought
was
playing
its
part
in
containing
s
enormous
mass
of
cavalry
and
covering
the
valverde
and
badajoz
road
the
line
of
communication
of
the
allied
army
he
sent
back
instead
to
order
up
hamilton
s
portuguese
to
the
hilltop
fresh
infantry
but
it
took
a
much
greater
time
to
bring
them
up
than
beresford
had
expected
some
of
the
sent
to
summon
them
were
wounded
on
the
way
but
the
main
delay
was
caused
by
the
fact
that
hamilton
instead
of
taking
up
stewart
s
original
position
had
gone
down
closer
to
albuera
to
support
alten
s
brigade
at
the
village
against
godinot
s
attack
which
had
become
a
very
fierce
one
it
was
only
after
many
precious
minutes
had
been
wasted
that
he
was
found
and
fonseca
s
and
collins
s
brigades
did
not
start
for
half
an
hour
after
the
order
had
been
sent
to
them
campbell
s
brigade
remained
to
give
alten
help
if
he
should
need
it
meanwhile
beresford
was
trying
to
utilize
the
troops
already
at
hand
abercrombie
s
brigade
was
told
to
wheel
inward
and
attack
the
right
flank
of
the
corps
while
the
marshal
himself
tried
to
move
up
carlos
de
españa
s
spanish
brigade
to
the
place
where
colborne
had
fought
so
unsuccessfully
a
little
earlier
on
the
left
flank
of
the
french
mass
but
this
brigade
demoralized
relics
of
the
lost
army
of
the
gebora
refused
to
face
the
fire
though
the
marshal
went
to
lead
it
on
in
person
seized
one
colonel
by
the
epaulettes
and
tried
to
drag
him
to
the
front
of
his
battalion
as
this
brigade
only
lost
men
out
of
present
it
is
clear
that
it
misbehaved
at
last
beresford
grew
so
anxious
at
the
sight
of
hoghton
s
gallant
brigade
shrinking
away
to
nothing
while
no
succour
appeared
from
the
rear
that
he
actually
sent
orders
to
alten
s
germans
to
evacuate
albuera
village
and
to
come
in
haste
to
strengthen
the
centre
they
were
to
be
relieved
by
a
brigade
of
the
spaniards
who
still
held
the
old
position
above
the
village
the
legionaries
were
disentangled
from
the
village
with
some
difficulty
and
the
french
léger
got
into
it
before
the
spaniards
had
taken
alten
s
place
if
godinot
had
been
in
force
the
position
here
would
have
been
very
dangerous
but
he
had
only
six
battalions
men
in
all
and
was
hopelessly
outnumbered
for
hamilton
had
left
campbell
s
portuguese
brigade
opposite
him
and
spaniards
came
down
from
the
heights
as
a
matter
of
fact
alten
never
had
to
go
to
the
front
the
crisis
on
the
heights
was
over
before
he
got
far
from
the
village
and
he
was
sent
back
to
retake
it
half
an
hour
after
he
had
given
it
up
this
he
accomplished
with
a
loss
of
men
long
after
the
more
important
business
on
the
heights
was
over
the
stroke
which
ended
the
battle
came
from
a
direction
where
beresford
had
intended
to
keep
to
the
defensive
and
was
delivered
by
the
one
part
of
his
army
which
he
had
refused
to
utilize
the
division
cole
and
his
eight
battalions
had
been
standing
for
an
hour
and
a
half
supporting
the
allied
cavalry
opposite
maubourg
s
threatening
squadrons
he
was
himself
doubting
whether
he
ought
not
to
take
a
more
active
part
and
sent
an
to
beresford
to
ask
for
further
orders
but
this
officer
was
badly
wounded
on
the
way
and
the
message
was
never
delivered
if
it
had
been
the
answer
would
undoubtedly
have
been
in
the
negative
this
was
an
officer
major
roverea
whose
memoirs
have
lately
been
published
but
at
this
moment
there
rode
up
to
the
division
henry
hardinge
then
a
young
portuguese
colonel
and
deputy
of
the
portuguese
army
he
had
no
orders
from
beresford
but
he
took
upon
himself
to
urge
cole
to
assume
the
responsibility
of
advancing
saying
what
was
true
enough
that
hoghton
s
brigade
on
the
heights
above
could
not
hold
out
much
longer
and
that
there
were
no
british
reserves
behind
the
centre
cole
hesitated
for
a
moment
the
proposal
that
he
should
advance
across
open
ground
in
face
of
french
cavalry
without
any
adequate
support
of
that
arm
on
his
own
side
was
enough
to
make
any
man
think
twice
but
he
had
already
been
pondering
over
the
move
himself
and
after
a
short
conference
with
lumley
his
colleague
in
command
of
the
cavalry
determined
to
risk
all
the
division
was
ordered
to
deploy
from
columns
into
line
and
to
strike
obliquely
at
the
french
flank
entirely
conscious
of
the
danger
from
the
squadrons
of
french
horse
before
him
cole
flanked
his
deployed
battalions
with
a
unit
in
column
at
either
end
at
the
right
flank
where
harvey
s
portuguese
brigade
was
drawn
out
he
placed
a
provisional
battalion
made
up
of
the
nine
light
companies
of
all
his
regiments
british
and
portuguese
at
the
left
extremity
on
the
flank
of
his
british
fusilier
brigade
the
two
battalions
of
the
and
the
royal
welsh
fusiliers
was
a
good
portuguese
unit
hawkshaw
s
battalion
of
the
loyal
lusitanian
legion
the
line
made
up

british
portuguese
the
whole
of
the
english
and
spanish
cavalry
advanced
on
his
flank
and
rear
lefebure
s
battery
accompanying
the
extreme
right
it
appears
that
the
three
stray
companies
from
kemmis
s
absent
brigade
which
had
reached
the
field
were
put
into
the
square
at
the
right
flank
also
what
exactly
passed
between
cole
and
hardinge
is
thoroughly
worked
out
by
the
correspondence
between
them
printed
in
the
service
for
the
sight
of
this
mile
of
bayonets
moving
forward
showed
soult
that
he
must
fight
for
his
life
there
was
no
drawn
battle
possible
but
only
dire
disaster
unless
cole
were
stopped
accordingly
he
told
to
charge
the
portuguese
brigade
while
the
whole
nine
battalions
of
werlé
s
reserve
were
sent
forward
diagonally
to
protect
the
flank
of
the
corps
moving
along
the
upper
slope
of
the
heights
so
as
to
thrust
themselves
between
the
fusilier
brigade
and
the
flank
of
girard
and
gazan
soult
had
now
no
reserve
left
except
the
two
battalions
of
which
he
held
back
for
the
last
chance
on
his
right
rear
keeping
up
the
connexion
with
godinot
the
story
of
what
happened
at
the
right
end
of
cole
s
line
is
simple
sent
four
regiments
of
dragoons
at
the
middle
of
the
portuguese
brigade
thinking
to
break
it
down
as
he
had
done
often
before
with
deployed
infantry
in
spanish
battles
but
harvey
s
four
battalions
keeping
absolutely
steady
delivered
a
series
of
volleys
which
completely
shattered
the
advance
of
the
charging
squadrons
it
was
a
fine
achievement
for
troops
which
had
never
before
taken
part
in
the
thick
of
a
battle
for
the
and
portuguese
line
had
not
been
engaged
at
bussaco
or
any
previous
action
of
importance
owing
to
their
excellent
behaviour
the
flank
of
the
british
brigade
was
kept
perfectly
safe
from
cavalry
assaults
during
the
next
myers
s
three
fusilier
battalions
therefore
with
the
lusitanian
legion
battalion
that
guarded
their
left
rear
came
into
collision
with
werlé
s
three
regiments
without
any
interference
from
without
they
were
outnumbered
by
over
two
to
one
british
and
portuguese
against
french
but
werlé
had
adopted
the
same
vicious
formation
which
had
already
hampered
the
corps
his
nine
battalions
were
in
three
columns
of
regiments
each
with
a
front
of
only
two
companies
and
a
depth
of
nine
he
was
opposing
in
each
case
a
front
of
about
men
in
the
first
two
ranks
capable
of
using
their
muskets
to
a
front
of
about
the
fact
that
there
were
men
in
depth
behind
the
who
could
fire
was
of
no
profit
to
him
three
separate
regimental
duels
followed
the
and
the
and
battalions
of
the
fusiliers
each
tackled
a
column
as
blakeney
the
colonel
of
the
unit
tells
in
his
letter
in
each
case
the
stress
for
the
moment
was
tremendous
blakeney
may
be
quoted
for
its
general
character
quoted
in
the
correspondence
in
the
service
for
from
the
quantity
of
smoke
he
writes
i
could
perceive
very
little
but
what
went
on
in
my
own
front
the
battalion
of
the
closed
with
the
right
column
of
the
french
i
moved
on
and
closed
with
the
second
the
took
the
third
the
men
behaved
most
gloriously
never
losing
their
rank
and
closing
to
the
centre
as
casualties
occurred
the
french
faced
us
at
a
distance
of
about
thirty
or
forty
paces
during
the
closest
part
of
the
action
i
saw
their
officers
endeavouring
to
deploy
their
columns
but
all
to
no
purpose
for
as
soon
as
the
third
of
a
company
got
out
they
would
immediately
run
back
to
be
covered
by
the
front
of
their
this
lasted
for
some
minutes
possibly
twenty
when
suddenly
the
enemy
broke
and
went
up
the
hillside
in
three
disorderly
clumps
which
presently
splayed
out
into
a
mass
of
running
men
the
fusiliers
followed
still
firing
until
they
crowned
the
ridge
the
end
of
their
movement
was
under
a
terrible
artillery
fire
from
soult
s
reserve
batteries
which
were
used
till
the
last
possible
moment
to
cover
the
flying
infantry
the
fusiliers
lost
more
than
half
their
numbers
out
of
officers
and
men
their
gallant
brigadier
myers
was
among
the
slain
werlé
s
three
regiments
had
casualties
of
well
over
out
of
present
a
bigger
total
but
a
much
smaller
percentage
one
in
three
instead
of
the
victors
one
in
two
the
rout
of
the
french
reserves
would
have
settled
the
fate
of
the
battle
in
any
case
but
already
it
was
won
on
the
summit
of
the
plateau
also
for
at
the
same
moment
when
the
fusiliers
closed
abercrombie
s
brigade
had
wheeled
in
upon
the
right
of
the
mass
that
represented
the
corps
and
when
they
followed
up
their
volleys
with
a
charge
girard
s
and
gazan
s
men
ran
to
the
rear
along
the
heights
leaving
hoghton
s
exhausted
brigade
lying
dead
in
line
in
front
of
them
the
fugitives
of
the
corps
mingled
with
those
from
werlé
s
brigade
and
all
passed
the
chicapierna
brook
in
one
vast
horde
there
was
practically
no
pursuit
threw
his
squadrons
between
the
flying
mass
and
the
victorious
allies
and
the
british
and
portuguese
halted
on
the
heights
that
they
had
won
soult
s
last
infantry
reserve
the
two
grenadier
battalions
were
also
drawn
out
on
the
nearer
side
of
the
chicapierna
and
suffered
severely
from
the
artillery
fire
of
the
allies
losing
men
out
of
in
twenty
minutes
but
lumley
s
cavalry
could
not
meddle
with
s
double
strength
and
it
was
not
till
some
time
had
passed
that
beresford
brought
up
three
portuguese
brigades
in
line
collins
fonseca
and
harvey
and
finally
pushed
the
enemy
over
the
brook
by
this
moment
soult
had
got
nearly
all
his
artillery
forty
guns
in
line
on
the
height
between
the
two
brooks
and
their
fire
forbade
further
progress
unless
beresford
were
prepared
to
storm
that
position
with
the
portuguese
he
refused
to
try
it
and
wisely
for
though
the
enemy
s
infantry
were
completely
out
of
action
it
is
a
formidable
thing
to
deliver
a
frontal
attack
on
six
batteries
flanked
by
horse
so
finished
the
fight
of
albuera
a
drenching
rain
similar
to
that
which
had
been
so
deadly
to
colborne
s
brigade
ended
the
day
and
made
more
miserable
the
lot
of
the
wounded
who
lay
scattered
over
the
hillsides
the
british
had
hardly
enough
sound
men
left
in
half
the
battalions
to
pick
up
their
own
bleeding
comrades
much
less
to
bear
off
the
mounds
of
french
wounded
who
lay
along
the
slopes
of
the
gentle
dip
where
the
battle
had
raged
hardest
it
was
two
days
before
the
last
of
these
were
gathered
in
that
albuera
was
the
most
bloody
of
all
the
fights
of
the
peninsular
war
in
proportion
to
the
numbers
engaged
everybody
knows
but
the
exact
table
of
the
losses
on
each
side
has
never
i
believe
been
fully
worked
out
after
studying
the
french
returns
in
the
archives
of
the
paris
ministry
of
war
and
the
spanish
figures
at
madrid
no
less
than
beresford
s
report
we
get
to
the
results
which
i
have
printed
in
the
xvth
appendix
to
this
volume
summarizing
them
we
find
that
the
british
including
alten
s
german
battalions
had
men
on
the
field
their
total
loss
was
officers
and
men
of
these
were
killed
wounded
and
missing
of
this
frightful
casualty
list
no
less
than
belonged
to
the
three
brigades
of
colborne
hoghton
and
myers
for
the
cavalry
and
artillery
with
alten
s
and
abercrombie
s
brigades
of
infantry
though
all
seriously
engaged
lost
but
out
of
nearly
men
present
the
remaining
casualties
all
came
from
the
ranks
of
the
three
brigades
whose
total
strength
on
the
field
was
but
colborne
s
brigade
lost
in
an
instant
as
it
were
under
the
charge
of
the
lancers
and
hussars
of
its
numbers
men
out
of
of
the
who
were
left
standing
nearly
half
belonged
to
the
the
battalion
which
was
not
broken
by
the
cavalry
charge
and
survived
to
join
in
hoghton
s
advance
the
brigades
of
hoghton
and
myers
were
not
like
colborne
s
annihilated
in
one
awful
moment
of
disaster
but
used
up
in
continuous
fighting
at
short
musketry
range
with
an
enemy
of
far
superior
numbers
the
former
took
officers
and
men
into
the
field
and
lost
the
latter
the
two
battalions
of
the
royal
fusiliers
and
the
battalion
of
the
welsh
fusiliers
had
combatants
present
and
lost
hoghton
s
troops
therefore
lost
myers
s
of
their
strength
and
these
were
victorious
units
which
hardly
left
a
single
prisoner
in
the
enemy
s
hands
and
finally
drove
their
adversaries
from
the
field
in
spite
of
a
twofold
inequality
of
numbers
truly
albuera
is
the
most
honourable
of
all
peninsular
blazons
on
a
regimental
flag
of
the
portuguese
only
harvey
s
brigade
was
seriously
engaged
it
had
over
casualties
out
of
the
suffered
on
that
day
by
troops
of
that
nation
and
established
a
most
honourable
record
by
its
defeat
of
s
dragoons
the
other
men
killed
or
hurt
were
distributed
in
fives
and
tens
over
the
battalions
of
fonseca
collins
and
campbell
which
only
came
under
fire
in
the
last
stage
of
the
battle
of
which
no
less
than
were
in
the
battalion
of
the
lusitanian
legion
which
formed
cole
s
on
the
left
it
suffered
terribly
from
artillery
fire
the
spaniards
returned
casualties
out
of
present
of
which
as
we
have
already
seen
no
less
than
were
in
those
four
battalions
of
zayas
s
division
which
held
out
so
stubbornly
against
the
corps
till
hoghton
s
men
came
up
to
relieve
them
of
the
rest
ballasteros
s
and
lardizabal
s
divisions
with
under
casualties
each
had
only
suffered
from
skirmishing
or
distant
artillery
fire
the
losses
of
carlos
de
españa
and
the
cavalry
were
insignificant
illustration
albuera
nº
about
there
should
be
only
two
not
three
battalions
of
grenadiers
placed
as
reserve
behind
girard
and
gazan
s
troops
the
french
losses
can
be
made
out
with
reasonable
certainty
after
careful
comparison
of
different
returns
in
the
paris
archives
soult
had
the
shamelessness
to
assert
in
his
dispatch
to
the
emperor
that
he
had
only
killed
and
wounded
but
a
tardily
prepared
and
incomplete
list
drawn
up
on
july
gave
casualties
of
whom
were
missing
wounded
prisoners
left
on
the
allied
position
unfortunately
this
return
on
examination
turns
out
to
be
far
from
satisfactory
soult
gives
officers
killed
wounded
or
missing
but
the
regimental
returns
when
compiled
show
a
much
higher
figure
and
can
not
possibly
be
wrong
since
the
name
and
rank
of
every
officer
hit
is
carefully
recorded
for
documentary
and
official
purposes
but
if
casualties
among
officers
correspond
as
the
return
of
july
states
to
among
the
rank
and
file
then
officers
hit
must
imply
men
disabled
and
this
we
may
conclude
was
very
near
the
real
figure
belmas
and
lapéne
the
most
trustworthy
french
historians
of
the
campaign
agree
in
giving
a
thousand
more
than
soult
conceded
in
his
tardy
and
incomplete
return
this
proportion
out
of
men
put
in
the
field
is
sufficiently
heavy
though
exceeded
so
terribly
by
the
men
lost
out
of
among
the
british
troops
the
units
which
suffered
most
heavily
were
the
two
divisions
of
the
corps
which
must
have
lost
nearly
out
of
present
werlé
s
reserve
had
probably
close
on
casualties
out
of
bayonets
godinot
s
column
and
the
cavalry
had
very
considerable
losses
but
were
the
only
troops
fit
for
action
next
day
the
corps
was
absolutely
wrecked
in
some
battalions
there
were
only
three
or
four
officers
unhurt
and
the
losses
were
similar
to
those
in
myers
s
or
hoghton
s
british
brigades
two
or
three
others
had
fared
comparatively
better
having
been
in
the
flank
or
rear
at
the
time
when
the
desperate
musketry
duel
in
the
front
was
in
progress

whole

not
have
been
put
in

of

unlikely
event
of
its
being
forced
upon
him
but
was
not
willing
to
attack
an
enemy
hidden
behind
a
screen
of
woods
and
possessed
of
a
superior
and
still
effective
cavalry
and
artillery
such
an
attack
must
have
been
delivered
mainly
by
the
spanish
and
portuguese
infantry
since
of
the
british
only
abercrombie
s
and
alten
s
five
battalions
were
fit
for
immediate
service
the
missing
brigade
of
kemmis
arrived
during
the
day
after
a
fatiguing
march
over
the
jerumenha
bridge
and
added
bayonets
more
but
even
so
there
would
have
been
only
british
infantry
in
full
fighting
trim
the
sad
relics
of
hoghton
s
and
colborne
s
brigades
were
organized
into
two
provisional
battalions
of
men
each
where
whole
regiments
were
represented
by
one
two
or
at
the
most
three
companies
myers
s
brigade
had
men
left
so
was
better
off
but
no
general
would
have
dreamed
of
using
any
of
these
troops
for
offensive
action
on
the
day
after
the
battle
an
attack
would
have
had
to
be
delivered
by
the
portuguese
infantry
backed
by
the
spaniards
and
abercrombie
alten
and
kemmis
beresford
refused
to
try
it
even
though
he
knew
that
soult
s
losses
had
been
greater
than
his
own
so
far
as
mere
numbers
went
probably
he
argued
soult
would
retire
covered
by
his
cavalry
and
artillery
if
he
were
assailed
covered
by
the
woods
he
could
get
off
as
he
pleased
but
soult
was
certain
to
retire
in
any
case
as
news
had
now
come
to
hand
that
wellington
was
coming
down
to
elvas
with
two
divisions
and
might
be
expected
there
immediately
he
actually
arrived
on
the
the
head
of
his
column
had
marched
on
the
and
reached
elvas
on
the
to
risk
anything
in
order
to
get
soult
on
the
move
a
few
days
earlier
was
not
worth
while
d
urban
in
his
diary
under
the
first
speaks
of
an
attack
by
soult
being
possible
and
then
concludes
it
impossible
kemmis
s
arrival
he
thinks
will
have
cured
the
marshal
of
any
idea
of
returning
to
the
fight
his
intention
to
come
appears
in
his
letter
to
beresford
of
may
received
may
the
statement
that
the
division
and
other
troops
had
actually
started
for
estremadura
is
in
his
letter
of
may
received
may
vii
and
the
french
marshal
was
even
further
than
beresford
from
the
idea
of
renewing
operations
on
the
he
had
shot
his
bolt
and
failed
the
battle
so
he
declared
would
never
have
been
fought
if
he
had
known
that
blake
had
joined
the
british
on
the
night
of
the
his
main
object
in
keeping
his
ground
for
a
day
was
to
organize
the
transport
of
a
column
of
wounded
on
to
seville
if
he
had
retired
at
once
the
greater
part
of
them
would
have
had
to
be
abandoned
as
it
was
his
transport
was
used
up
and
several
hundreds
of
severe
cases
had
to
be
left
to
the
mercy
of
the
allies
in
and
about
the
chapel
in
the
wood
of

beresford
found
them
there
on
the
morning
of

his
retreat
before

some
hours
after
the
battle
was
over
gazan

wounded
and
some
men
from
the
regiments
which
had
been
most
cut
up
guarded
the
convoy
which
included
the
british
prisoners
southward
along
the
great
soult
himself
with
the
rest
of
the
army
now
reduced
to
men
at
the
most
retired
by
a
more
circuitous
route
by
solana
and
fuente
del
maestre
towards
llerena
and
the
sierra
morena
beresford
s
cavalry
followed
but
was
unable
to
do
anything
in
face
of
s
preponderant
squadrons
the
allied
infantry
remained
behind
to
resume
the
siege
of
badajoz
on
the
hamilton
s
division
and
madden
s
cavalry
were
sent
back
to
invest
the
place
which
was
shut
in
again
at
dawn
on
the
after
having
been
relieved
of
the
presence
of
the
allies
for
only
three
days
may
general
phillipon
had
employed
this
short
respite
in
the
useful
task
of
levelling
the
allied
trenches
and
batteries
outside
his
works
he
found
nothing
in
them
of
which
he
could
make
booty
save
the
heavy
wood
employed
for
the
before
san
cristobal
the
more
valuable
stores
had
all
been
removed
to
elvas
the
gabions
and
fascines
burned
by
the
division
before
it
gave
up
the
investment
on
the
night
of

may
of
whom
more
than
escaped
and
joined
their
regiments
during
the
next
four
days
for
their
guards
were
too
exhausted
to
keep
good
watch
that
albuera
with
all
its
slaughter
was
a
battle
in
which
both
sides
committed
serious
errors
is
generally
acknowledged
but
few
are
the
general
actions
in
which
there
is
nothing
to
criticize
on
the
part
of
the
victor
much
more
of
the
vanquished
we
must
however
protest
against
napier
s
sweeping
assertion
that
no
general
ever
gained
so
great
a
battle
with
so
little
increase
of
military
reputation
as
marshal
beresford
his
triumph
was
disputed
by
the
very
soldiers
who
followed
his
car
their
censures
have
been
reiterated
without
change
and
without
abatement
to
this
hour
and
a
close
examination
while
it
detects
many
observations
and
others
tainted
with
malice
leaves
little
doubt
that
the
general
feeling
was
right
napier
then
proceeds
to
argue
that
beresford
ought
to
have
refused
battle
and
retired
beyond
the
guadiana
that
his
concentration
was
and
that
considering
the
doubtful
quality
of
blake
s
troops
he
was
too
bold
in
fighting
his
tactical
dispositions
were
bad
he
occupied
the
position
so
as
to
render
defeat
almost
certain
he
brought
up
his
reserves
in
a
succession
of
separate
attacks
and
hesitated
too
long
to
move
the
division
hardinge
caused
cole
and
abercrombie
to
win
the
victory
the
guidance
of
a
commanding
mind
was
nowhere
seen
if
any
one
wants
an
example
of
such
a
battle
he
may
take
the
first
great
fight
of
frederick
the
great
who
had
been
driven
ten
miles
off
the
battlefield
with
the
wreck
of
his
cavalry
when
news
came
to
him
that
his
infantry
in
his
absence
and
without
his
leadership
had
won
the
battle
for
him
iii
napier
was
beresford
s
bitter
enemy
and
it
is
clear
that
his
eloquent
denunciations
of
the
marshal
were
inspired
by
a
personal
animosity
which
clouded
his
judgement
his
account
of
albuera
is
one
of
the
finest
pieces
of
military
writing
in
the
english
language
but
it
bristles
with
mistakes
many
of
them
worked
in
so
as
to
throw
additional
discredit
on
his
enemy
s
capacity
one
turns
naturally
to
investigate
wellington
s
observations
on
the
fight
made
when
he
had
ridden
over
the
field
on
may
only
five
days
after
the
battle
in
one
private
letter
he
writes
we
had
a
very
good
position
and
i
think
should
have
gained
a
complete
victory
without
any
material
loss
if
the
spaniards
could
have
manœuvred
but
unfortunately
they
can
not
in
another
he
says
the
spanish
troops
behaved
admirably
i
understand
they
stood
like
stocks
while
both
parties
were
firing
into
them
but
they
were
quite
immovable
and
this
was
the
great
cause
of
all
our
losses
after
they
had
lost
their
position
the
natural
thing
to
do
would
have
been
to
attack
it
with
the
nearest
spanish
troops
but
these
could
not
be
moved
the
british
troops
division
were
next
and
they
were
brought
up
and
must
in
such
cases
always
be
brought
up
and
they
suffered
such
as
the
statement
that
zayas
had
given
way
before
colborne
arrived
at
the
front
which
the
evidence
of
beresford
himself
d
urban
schepeler
moyle
sherer
and
many
other
witnesses
proves
to
be
quite
wrong
also
the
tale
that
the
spaniards
fired
into
the
british
see
pp
and
schepeler
also
the
statement
that
lumley
s
cavalry
diversion
to
help
colborne
was
successful
when
it
merely
resulted
in
the
repulse
of
the
two
squadrons
that
made
it
with
the
loss
of
their
two
commanding
officers
captains
spedding
and
phillips
taken
prisoners
an
astonishing
bit
of
arithmetic
is
the
note
iii
that
on
the
night
of
the
battle
only
unwounded
british
infantry
were
left
standing
the
real
figures
being
abercrombie
alten
remains
of
myers
s
brigade
remains
of
colborne
s
brigade
ditto
of
hoghton
s
total
napier
had
apparently
forgotten
abercrombie
and
alten
wellington
s
opinion
therefore
was
that
blake
s
slowness
in
guarding
against
the
flank
attack
was
the
real
cause
of
all
the
trouble
considering
the
gallant
way
in
which
zayas
s
four
battalions
fought
when
once
they
were
in
line
it
certainly
seems
that
if
thrice
the
force
which
that
officer
was
given
had
been
thrown
back
across
the
heights
as
beresford
desired
at
the
moment
that
soult
s
movement
was
detected
they
would
have
held
their
own
so
effectively
that
the
british
division
could
have
come
up
at
leisure
and
in
order
to
support
the
spaniards
as
it
was
the
reinforcements
sent
by
blake
to
help
zayas
arrived
by
driblets
and
gave
him
little
help
falling
into
a
mere
with
the
french
light
troops
on
zayas
s
left
instead
of
engaging
in
the
main
battle
after
blake
s
slowness
the
main
cause
of
loss
was
william
stewart
s
beresford
had
given
orders
that
the
whole
division
was
to
form
up
in
a
second
line
behind
zayas
and
go
into
action
simultaneously
outflanking
the
massed
corps
on
either
wing
stewart
combining
and
want
of
discipline
attacked
with
the
first
brigade
that
came
up
while
the
second
and
the
third
were
still
remote
he
also
if
several
contemporaries
are
to
be
trusted
refused
to
listen
to
colonel
colborne
s
request
to
be
allowed
to
keep
a
unit
in
square
or
column
to
protect
the
flank
of
the
brigade
when
it
started
out
to
make
its
attack
and
it
was
the
want
of
this
alone
which
made
the
charge
of
the
polish
lancers
so
effective
as
beresford
s
vindicator
writes
the
marshal
had
directed
sir
william
stewart
to
form
the
second
line
he
could
not
distrust
an
officer
of
his
experience
zeal
and
knowledge
of
the
that
his
subordinate
should
be
struck
with
sudden
and
attack
the
french
flank
with
one
isolated
brigade
contrary
to
his
orders
can
not
be
imputed
as
a
crime
to
beresford
who
was
in
no
way
responsible
for
it
the
move
and
the
disaster
that
followed
within
a
few
minutes
took
place
without
his
knowledge
as
he
was
endeavouring
to
put
in
line
the
spanish
battalions
which
were
coming
up
to
reinforce
zayas
he
was
surprised
by
being
charged
in
the
midst
of
his
staff
by
a
knot
of
the
lancers
who
a
minute
before
had
ridden
over
colborne
s
men
on
his
right
it
is
clear
that
if
the
three
brigades
of
the
division
had
been
properly
arranged
and
put
into
action
simultaneously
as
beresford
intended
the
corps
would
have
been
driven
from
the
heights
an
hour
before
it
actually
yielded
girard
s
division
had
already
wellnigh
exhausted
itself
upon
zayas
s
stubborn
resistance
and
it
was
only
the
interval
in
the
allied
attack
caused
by
the
destruction
of
colborne
s
brigade
which
permitted
gazan
s
troops
to
get
up
into
the
front
line
in
such
order
as
they
could
in
time
to
fight
hoghton
and
abercrombie
if
stewart
s
advance
had
been
made
at
the
proper
time
he
would
have
come
upon
the
two
french
divisions
at
the
very
moment
when
they
were
making
their
confused
change
of
front
they
could
not
have
resisted
the
assault
considering
the
disorder
in
which
they
were
mingled
soult
who
had
just
made
up
his
mind
to
discontinue
the
offensive
battle
in
which
he
was
engaged
would
certainly
have
used
werlé
s
reserve
only
to
cover
his
retreat
and
would
have
withdrawn
from
a
position
which
had
become
desperate
covered
by
his
cavalry
see
above
the
one
point
in
which
napier
s
charges
against
beresford
have
some
foundation
is
that
there
was
undoubtedly
much
delay
in
putting
cole
and
the
division
into
action
this
as
we
have
shown
above
was
caused
by
beresford
s
wish
to
strike
the
final
blow
at
the
corps
with
hamilton
s
portuguese
whom
he
had
ordered
to
the
front
after
colborne
s
disaster
and
who
did
not
make
their
appearance
partly
because
the
first
sent
for
them
was
wounded
on
the
way
partly
because
hamilton
had
changed
his
position
and
was
not
found
at
once
by
later
messengers
when
it
became
evident
that
the
delay
was
growing
dangerous
beresford
would
have
done
well
to
send
cole
orders
to
advance
at
once
and
to
have
directed
abercrombie
also
to
charge
napier
is
right
in
saying
that
hardinge
caused
cole
to
win
the
victory
for
cole
s
advance
was
made
without
beresford
s
orders
and
even
contrary
to
his
intention
since
he
had
sent
for
alten
and
the
portuguese
to
make
the
final
stroke
but
while
they
were
being
collected
hoghton
s
brigade
had
been
practically
used
up
and
there
was
nothing
but
zayas
s
reformed
but
exhausted
battalions
in
hoghton
s
rear
to
form
the
allied
centre
it
is
true
however
that
supposing
the
last
relics
of
the
and
their
comrades
had
finally
recoiled
there
would
have
been
no
push
or
impetus
left
in
their
opponents
of
the
corps
who
were
a
spent
force
in
complete
disorder
and
with
hardly
one
man
in
two
left
standing
while
they
were
disentangling
themselves
for
a
final
effort
collins
s
and
fonseca
s
portuguese
perfectly
trustworthy
troops
and
absolutely
fresh
would
have
been
getting
into
position
it
is
practically
certain
that
soult
would
have
made
no
further
attempt
to
go
forward
his
own
dispatch
states
that
he
had
abandoned
all
offensive
intentions
this
much
beresford
s
advocates
may
plead
but
it
remains
true
that
the
moral
impression
of
albuera
would
have
been
very
different
if
the
charge
of
the
fusilier
brigade
had
never
taken
place
it
was
their
triumphant
sweeping
away
of
werlé
s
reserve
which
struck
dismay
into
the
enemy
if
it
had
never
occurred
soult
would
have
retired
foiled
indeed
but
in
good
order
and
with
two
or
three
thousand
fewer
casualties
than
he
actually
suffered
in
criticizing
the
operations
of
the
french
the
main
point
which
strikes
us
is
that
soult
stands
of
hesitation
and
divided
purpose
in
the
crisis
of
the
battle
his
attack
had
been
admirable
the
movement
which
threw
of
his
available
force
unexpectedly
on
to
beresford
s
flank
was
beautifully
designed
and
carried
out
but
when
in
the
check
and
pause
that
followed
the
incident
of
colborne
s
disaster
he
realized
as
he
himself
says
that
he
had
men
and
not
to
fight
and
that
the
odds
were
no
longer
fair
he
should
have
made
up
his
mind
either
to
withdraw
under
cover
of
his
splendid
cavalry
or
else
to
risk
all
and
throw
his
infantry
reserves
straight
into
the
fight
before
the
enemy
s
line
was
reformed
he
did
neither
but
as
he
says
giving
up
his
original
project
aimed
at
nothing
more
than
retaining
the
ground
already
what
use
was
half
a
mile
of
hillside
to
him
if
he
had
failed
to
break
the
allies
and
drive
them
off
the
position
which
covered
the
road
to
badajoz
he
deserved
the
beating
that
he
got
for
this
extraordinary
resolve
as
to
the
details
of
the
french
tactics
girard
was
responsible
for
the
dense
order
of
the
corps
which
told
so
fatally
on
his
men
but
in
arranging
them
as
he
did
he
was
but
adopting
the
method
that
most
other
french
generals
were
wont
to
use
accustomed
to
break
through
the
lines
of
continental
armies
by
the
impetus
of
a
solid
mass
and
not
by
musketry
fire
he
prepared
to
employ
the
normal
of
the
column
of
it
may
be
even
noticed
that
more
enlightened
than
many
of
his
comrades
he
used
the
recommended
by
napoleon
in
which
some
battalions
in
line
were
interspersed
among
the
columns
his
array
was
better
than
that
of
victor
at
barrosa
or
talavera
or
that
of
reynier
and
ney
at
bussaco
but
he
had
never
met
the
british
line
before
this
was
the
first
time
that
the
corps
saw
the
and
he
did
not
know
the
unwelcome
truth
that
reille
told
napoleon
before
waterloo
sire
l
infanterie
anglaise
en
duel
c
est
le
there
was
no
doubt
extra
confusion
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
division
of
the
corps
closed
up
too
near
to
the
first
so
that
the
des
when
it
was
brought
up
to
the
front
with
the
idea
of
passing
it
through
the
intervals
of
the
shattered
regiments
of
the
van
was
even
more
disorderly
than
was
necessary
but
the
crucial
mistake
repeated
by
every
french
general
throughout
the
war
was
to
come
on
in
column
at
all
against
the
british
line
girard
did
no
worse
than
his
contemporaries
and
the
gallant
obstinacy
of
his
troops
enabled
him
to
inflict
very
heavy
losses
upon
the
victors
has
sometimes
been
accused
of
making
insufficient
use
of
his
great
mass
of
cavalry
but
till
the
last
stage
of
the
battle
he
had
in
front
of
him
not
merely
lumley
s
squadrons
but
the
whole
division
to
attack
a
force
of
all
arms
in
a
good
position
with
cavalry
alone
would
have
been
dangerous
if
he
had
failed
the
flank
of
the
corps
would
have
been
laid
open
in
the
most
disastrous
fashion
probably
he
was
right
to
be
satisfied
in
containing
with
his
horse
men
of
them
good
infantry
belonging
to
the
enemy
his
brilliant
stroke
at
colborne
s
brigade
is
enough
to
save
his
reputation
as
a
though
as
we
have
said
before
he
was
no
strategist
by
this
alone
he
had
done
more
for
soult
than
any
other
french
officer
upon
the
field
the
real
hero
most
undoubtedly
of
the
whole
fight
was
sir
lowry
cole
who
showed
as
much
moral
courage
in
striking
in
on
his
own
responsibility
at
the
critical
moment
as
he
did
practical
skill
in
conducting
his
two
brigades
against
the
enemy
opposed
to
him
a
most
formidable
adversary
who
showed
squadrons
of
cavalry
opposed
to
one
of
his
wings
and
the
bayonets
of
werlé
s
infantry
opposed
to
the
other
with
harvey
s
portuguese
he
drove
off
the
cavalry
charge
with
myers
s
fusiliers
he
beat
to
pieces
the
heavy
columns
of
the
french
reserve
it
was
a
great
achievement
and
the
general
was
worthy
of
his
soldiers
no
less
than
the
soldiers
of
their
general
he
was
well
seconded
by
lumley
who
justified
in
the
most
splendid
way
his
sudden
appointment
to
the
command
of
the
cavalry
of
the
whole
army
only
a
few
hours
before
the
battle
note
the
result
of
a
four
hours
visit
to
the
field
of
albuera
on
a
very
hot
day
in
april
was
to
prove
to
me
that
napier
had
no
idea
of
its
topography
while
beresford
in
his
on
colonel
napier
s
describes
it
very
well
i
could
see
no
trace
of
several
things
on
which
napier
lays
stress
especially
the
ravine
behind
the
british
position
nearly
the
whole
of
the
field
is
now
arable
it
was
covered
thickly
with
small
red
poppies
when
i
visited
it
in
which
four
ploughs
were
cutting
long
seams
turning
up
a
thin
soil

chapter
i
the
second
british
siege
of
badajoz
the
short
campaign
of
fuentes
de
oñoro
had
not
been
without
important
results
but
it
had
left
the
general
strategical
aspect
of
affairs
in
the
peninsula
unaltered
almeida
had
fallen
and
it
had
been
demonstrated
that
the
french
army
of
portugal
was
not
strong
enough
to
force
back
wellington
from
the
frontier
where
he
had
taken
post
on
the
other
hand
it
was
equally
clear
that
wellington
was
far
too
weak
to
dream
of
taking
the
offensive
in
the
valley
of
the
douro
or
marching
on
salamanca
such
a
movement
would
have
brought
men
from
the
army
of
the
north
to
the
aid
of
the
army
of
portugal
and
the
allied
army
on
the
northern
frontier
was
barely
superior
in
numbers
to
the
latter
alone
even
when
the
corps
had
departed
for
andalusia
to
provoke
the
enemy
to
concentrate
would
have
been
insane
if
he
were
left
alone
however
it
was
improbable
that
he
would
prove
dangerous
for
many
a
day
marmont
had
to
complete
the
reorganization
of
the
army
which
he
had
just
taken
over
from
masséna
it
would
be
some
months
before
he
could
replace
the
lost
cavalry
and
artillery
fill
up
his
magazines
and
finish
the
reclothing
of
his
tattered
regiments
bessières
was
so
much
occupied
with
the
guerrilleros
that
he
would
not
draw
his
troops
together
unless
he
were
obliged
to
do
so
by
an
advance
of
the
allies
towards
his
territory
he
had
moreover
to
keep
covering
forces
out
to
north
and
west
in
order
to
watch
abadia
s
galician
army
and
longa
and
porlier
who
still
made
head
against
him
in
the
cantabrian
mountains
it
was
probable
therefore
that
the
french
in
leon
and
old
castile
would
keep
quiet
for
some
time
unless
they
were
provoked
wellington
resolved
to
leave
them
unmolested
and
to
endeavour
to
strike
a
blow
in
the
south
on
the
day
when
the
battle
of
fuentes
de
oñoro
was
fought
beresford
with
the
men
who
had
been
detached
to
estremadura
was
as
wellington
knew
just
about
to
commence
the
siege
of
badajoz
it
was
certain
that
this
enterprise
would
bring
soult
and
his
army
of
andalusia
to
the
succour
of
the
fortress
the
line
of
conduct
which
beresford
was
to
pursue
when
soult
should
appear
had
been
already
settled
he
was
to
fight
if
the
enemy
were
weak
to
retire
behind
the
guadiana
if
he
were
strong
but
meanwhile
it
was
now
possible
to
reinforce
beresford
with
men
since
marmont
and
bessières
would
be
out
of
the
game
for
many
weeks
leaving
nearly
men
on
the
dos
casas
and
the
coa
to
protect
the
portuguese
frontier
and
to
guard
the
repairing
of
almeida
wellington
could
march
to
join
the
army
of
estremadura
with
the
balance
of
his
army
he
thought
that
two
divisions
could
be
spared
and
chose
the
and
the
if
he
marched
rapidly
across
the
beira
with
this
force
he
might
arrive
in
time
to
join
beresford
for
the
battle
against
soult
which
was
inevitable
it
might
take
place
south
of
the
guadiana
if
the
french
marshal
had
delayed
his
advance
or
north
of
it
if
he
had
come
up
in
great
force
and
had
compelled
beresford
to
give
back
toward
elvas
and
to
abandon
the
siege
of
badajoz
but
in
either
case
beresford
s
army
reinforced
by
men
would
be
strong
enough
to
beat
soult
the
only
possible
contingency
to
be
feared
was
that
the
duke
of
dalmatia
might
abandon
granada
and
the
lines
before
cadiz
concentrate
men
and
let
andalusia
shift
for
itself
while
he
marched
on
badajoz
wellington
judged
and
rightly
that
it
was
most
improbable
that
he
would
make
this
desperate
move
and
evacuate
of
his
viceroyalty
in
order
to
make
certain
of
saving
badajoz
knowing
the
strength
of
beresford
and
castaños
he
would
come
with
the
or
men
that
he
could
collect
without
disgarrisoning
any
points
of
primary
importance
in
such
a
case
supposing
that
he
came
with
the
higher
figure
beresford
had
more
were
coming
down
from
the
beira
and
there
were
the
spaniards
of
blake
and
of
castaños
to
be
taken
into
consideration
soult
would
find
himself
faced
by
men
and
could
not
possibly
prevent
the
siege
of
badajoz
from
proceeding
if
the
place
could
be
taken
promptly
there
would
be
no
time
for
reinforcements
to
reach
the
marshal
from
the
army
of
portugal
or
the
army
of
the
centre
and
should
he
finally
resolve
to
draw
up
further
forces
from
andalusia
he
must
abandon
either
the
kingdom
of
granada
or
the
cadiz
lines
or
both
to
force
him
to
give
up
his
grasp
on
either
of
these
points
would
be
a
great
end
in
itself
and
a
sufficient
reward
for
a
successful
campaign
see
pp
but
everything
depended
on
swift
movement
and
the
economy
of
time
should
soult
refuse
to
fight
and
resolve
to
appeal
for
help
to
the
other
french
armies
it
was
certain
that
men
might
be
gathered
to
his
aid
within
a
month
or
five
weeks
all
the
troops
combined
supposing
that
every
man
were
drawn
in
from
the
north
to
join
beresford
would
not
make
up
over
sabres
and
bayonets
on
the
other
hand
a
junction
between
the
armies
of
andalusia
and
portugal
with
aid
lent
by
bessières
and
the
army
of
the
centre
could
certainly
produce
men
perhaps
more
wherefore
it
might
be
argued
that
if
badajoz
could
be
taken
in
a
month
a
great
success
might
be
scored
but
if
the
siege
were
to
linger
on
over
that
time
the
enemy
would
be
able
to
concentrate
in
such
force
that
the
enterprise
might
become
impracticable
the
game
was
worth
trying
wellington
s
dispatches
to
lord
liverpool
and
other
correspondents
between
the
and
the
of
may
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
these
were
his
views
fortunately
for
me
he
wrote
the
french
armies
have
no
communications
and
one
army
has
no
knowledge
of
the
position
or
of
the
circumstances
in
which
the
others
are
placed
whereas
i
have
a
knowledge
of
all
that
passes
on
all
sides
from
this
knowledge
i
think
i
may
draw
troops
from
beira
for
my
operations
against
badajoz
but
i
can
not
venture
further
south
till
i
shall
get
ciudad
rodrigo
without
exposing
all
to
ruin
again
i
do
not
think
it
possible
for
me
to
undertake
more
in
the
south
under
existing
circumstances
than
the
siege
of
badajoz
i
can
not
by
any
effort
i
can
make
increase
the
british
and
portuguese
in
that
quarter
beyond
men
to
which
the
spanish
force
may
add
or
more
he
was
perfectly
aware
that
a
concentration
against
him
was
possible
but
that
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
come
about
i
do
not
know
when
marmont
can
be
ready
to
with
soult
however
as
the
siege
of
badajoz
can
be
raised
with
ease
and
without
loss
whenever
it
may
be
necessary
i
have
thought
it
best
to
lose
no
time
and
to
adopt
every
means
to
get
that
place
if
i
can
before
the
enemy
s
troops
can
join
if
i
can
not
get
it
i
may
raise
the
siege
and
fight
a
battle
or
not
as
i
may
find
most
proper
according
to
the
state
of
our
respective
forces
it
is
clear
then
that
wellington
s
utmost
ambition
was
to
take
badajoz
and
that
he
foresaw
that
he
must
take
it
within
a
limited
time
under
penalty
of
seeing
the
scheme
fail
owing
to
the
concentration
of
the
enemy
his
letters
show
that
he
knew
that
drouet
and
the
corps
had
started
for
andalusia
immediately
after
fuentes
de
oñoro
and
in
calculating
soult
s
utmost
available
force
in
june
he
takes
drouet
into
account
though
he
somewhat
his
numerical
strength
to
lord
liverpool
may
to
beresford
may
the
total
allows
for
spencer
and
four
divisions
being
left
in
the
north
to
lord
liverpool
may
to
lord
liverpool
may
the
garrison
of
almeida
had
made
its
escape
on
the
night
of
may
the
french
army
had
drawn
back
beyond
ciudad
rodrigo
and
dispersed
itself
into
cantonments
on
may
as
early
as
the
morning
of
may
the
column
destined
for
estremadura
set
out
upon
its
march
it
consisted
as
has
been
already
mentioned
of
the
and
divisions
with
the
artillery
attached
to
them
for
the
purpose
of
providing
cavalry
for
scouting
and
exploration
the
hussars
of
the
king
s
german
legion
were
attached
this
corps
was
the
first
cavalry
reinforcement
that
wellington
had
received
for
more
than
a
year
it
had
landed
at
lisbon
in
april
and
had
marched
up
to
celorico
from
thence
it
was
ordered
to
strike
across
country
to
join
the
column
marching
for
the
valley
of
the
guadiana
and
to
place
itself
at
the
disposition
of
picton
its
senior
officer
they
met
at
belmonte
and
went
on
their
southward
way
in
company
the
route
lay
through
castello
branco
the
of
villa
velha
niza
and
portalegre
picton
reached
campo
mayor
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
badajoz
on
may
having
taken
ten
days
only
to
cross
the
roughest
and
most
thinly
peopled
corner
of
portugal
the
average
of
marching
had
been
fifteen
miles
a
day
an
excellent
rate
when
the
character
of
the
roads
is
taken
into
consideration
apparently
on
april
according
to
schwertfeger
s
of
the
german
i
illustration
the
third
division
crossing
the
tagus
at
villa
velha
may
wellington
himself
started
from
villar
formoso
two
days
after
the
departure
of
the
troops
on
may
and
riding
with
his
accustomed
headlong
speed
reached
elvas
on
the
afternoon
of
may
he
had
passed
picton
between
sabugal
and
belmonte
before
quitting
the
line
of
the
agueda
he
drew
up
elaborate
instructions
for
sir
brent
spencer
who
was
left
as
usual
in
charge
of
the
army
on
the
northern
frontier
the
force
entrusted
to
spencer
consisted
of
the
and
light
divisions
pack
s
and
ashworth
s
portuguese
brigades
and
the
cavalry
of
slade
arentschildt
and
barbaçena
altogether
about
foot
and
horse
the
directions
left
were
much
the
same
as
those
which
had
been
issued
during
wellington
s
earlier
visit
to
estremadura
in
april
it
is
probable
that
some
time
will
elapse
before
the
french
army
in
this
part
of
spain
will
be
capable
of
making
any
movement
against
the
yet
the
unexpected
might
happen
and
spencer
was
told
that
while
so
large
a
detachment
was
absent
in
the
south
he
must
adopt
a
purely
defensive
attitude
in
the
unlikely
event
of
marmont
s
taking
the
field
against
him
for
the
present
he
was
to
hold
the
line
of
the
azava
facing
ciudad
rodrigo
with
his
advanced
posts
the
divisions
were
to
be
cantoned
between
almeida
and
nava
de
aver
so
that
they
could
be
concentrated
in
a
single
day
if
the
enemy
should
advance
with
a
large
force
as
if
intending
a
serious
invasion
almeida
was
to
be
evacuated
since
it
would
be
impossible
that
the
repairs
to
its
ruined
ramparts
should
have
got
far
enough
to
render
the
place
tenable
the
army
was
to
fall
back
not
westward
towards
almeida
and
guarda
but
southwards
firstly
to
the
position
before
alfayates
which
had
already
been
marked
out
in
april
then
to
a
second
position
at
aldea
velha
and
rendo
then
to
a
third
beyond
the
coa
in
case
marmont
should
push
even
further
the
line
of
retreat
was
to
be
from
sabugal
to
belmonte
and
finally
by
the
mountain
road
of
the
estrada
nova
towards
the
zezere
but
the
strong
country
between
belmonte
and
the
zezere
must
not
be
given
up
in
a
hurry
all
this
was
pure
precaution
against
the
improbable
wellington
was
convinced
and
quite
rightly
that
marmont
would
be
incapable
for
some
weeks
probably
for
some
months
of
any
serious
offensive
action
against
portugal
to
invade
the
beira
he
would
have
to
collect
a
store
of
provisions
such
as
the
exhausted
kingdom
of
leon
could
not
possibly
give
him
his
magazines
were
known
to
have
been
empty
after
fuentes
de
oñoro
and
his
troops
had
been
dispersed
because
there
was
no
possibility
of
feeding
them
while
they
were
concentrated
spencer
could
be
in
no
possible
danger
for
many
a
day
so
strongly
did
wellington
feel
this
that
when
he
reached
elvas
he
wrote
back
to
his
lieutenant
on
may
that
he
intended
to
borrow
from
him
howard
s
british
and
ashworth
s
portuguese
brigades
and
thought
that
this
could
be
done
without
any
risk
but
if
notwithstanding
my
expectations
to
the
contrary
marmont
seemed
to
be
on
the
move
the
brigades
might
be
stopped
he
outrode
his
own
estimate
since
according
to
a
letter
to
charles
stuart
vii
he
had
intended
not
to
reach
elvas
till
the
unless
i
see
reason
on
the
road
to
go
a
little
memorandum
for
spencer
dated
may
the
night
before
wellington
s
departure
vii
to
spencer
may
vii
just
before
starting
on
his
ride
from
villar
formoso
to
elvas
wellington
received
beresford
s
dispatches
of
may
which
informed
him
that
soult
as
had
been
expected
was
on
the
march
from
seville
to
relieve
badajoz
and
that
according
to
the
instructions
that
had
been
given
the
allied
army
of
estremadura
would
fight
him
if
he
were
not
too
strong
to
be
meddled
with
it
was
the
news
that
battle
was
impending
which
made
the
quicken
his
pace
to
fifty
miles
a
day
in
hopes
that
he
might
be
in
time
to
take
charge
of
the
troops
in
person
he
galloped
ahead
and
on
the
morning
of
the
heard
between
niza
and
elvas
that
there
had
been
a
pitched
battle
on
the
and
that
soult
had
been
repulsed
the
details
met
him
at
elvas
where
arbuthnot
beresford
s
handed
him
the
albuera
dispatch
he
read
it
through
and
struck
out
some
paragraphs
before
sending
it
on
to
the
ministry
at
home
the
reason
for
these
erasures
was
that
he
considered
that
beresford
s
tone
was
a
little
too
desponding
and
that
he
had
laid
too
much
stress
on
the
terrible
loss
of
the
british
troops
and
too
little
on
the
complete
check
to
soult
s
designs
he
wrote
to
the
marshal
to
hearten
him
up
to
tell
him
that
the
result
achieved
had
been
worth
the
cost
you
could
not
be
successful
in
such
an
action
without
a
large
loss
and
we
must
make
up
our
mind
to
affairs
of
this
kind
sometimes
or
give
up
the
game
this
is
mentioned
by
wellington
himself
stanhope
s
he
could
not
stand
the
slaughter
about
him
and
the
vast
responsibility
the
letter
was
quite
in
a
desponding
tone
it
was
brought
me
by
arbuthnot
while
i
was
at
dinner
at
elvas
and
i
said
this
won
t
do
write
me
down
a
so
the
dispatch
was
altered
wellington
to
beresford
may
with
the
military
situation
that
he
found
in
existence
on
may
wellington
professed
himself
satisfied
hamilton
s
portuguese
division
had
reinvested
badajoz
on
the
preceding
day
soult
was
in
full
retreat
with
the
allied
cavalry
in
pursuit
of
him
it
was
uncertain
whether
he
would
fall
back
on
seville
or
halt
at
the
line
of
the
sierra
morena
but
at
any
rate
his
bolt
was
shot
he
could
give
no
trouble
for
some
weeks
and
would
only
become
dangerous
if
he
strengthened
his
army
by
calling
up
sebastiani
and
victor
and
evacuating
the
cadiz
lines
and
granada
this
wellington
rightly
believed
that
he
would
not
think
of
doing
he
would
rather
cry
for
aid
to
his
neighbours
and
it
would
take
a
long
time
for
reinforcements
to
reach
him
from
the
army
of
portugal
or
from
madrid
there
was
a
month
in
hand
and
badajoz
must
be
captured
if
possible
within
that
space
the
first
thing
necessary
was
to
push
soult
as
far
back
as
he
would
go
and
from
the
to
the
beresford
was
engaged
in
following
him
up
at
first
only
the
cavalry
was
available
for
pursuit
hamilton
s
division
had
been
sent
back
to
badajoz
the
and
were
allowed
five
days
of
repose
on
the
battlefield
of
albuera
not
only
were
they
absolutely
exhausted
but
all
their
transport
was
engaged
in
the
task
of
forwarding
to
elvas
convoy
after
convoy
of
british
wounded
the
french
of
whom
the
last
were
not
collected
till
three
days
after
the
battle
were
packed
in
an
extemporized
hospital
at
albuera
village
where
they
suffered
much
for
lack
of
surgeons
it
would
have
been
possible
to
send
blake
s
army
to
support
the
british
cavalry
if
he
had
possessed
provisions
but
he
reported
that
his
men
were
starving
and
that
he
must
disperse
them
to
procure
food
accordingly
they
were
sent
to
almendral
barcarrota
and
the
neighbouring
villages
to
gather
stores
as
best
they
might
soult
meanwhile
gave
back
slowly
being
hampered
by
his
immense
convoys
of
wounded
on
the
he
retired
from
solana
to
almendralejo
and
azeuchal
on
the
to
villafranca
and
fuente
del
maestre
on
the
he
was
in
march
for
usagre
and
llerena
so
that
it
was
evident
that
he
was
retiring
on
the
sierra
morena
by
the
llerena
and
not
by
the
monasterio
road
it
was
only
on
this
last
day
that
beresford
s
infantry
were
able
to
start
in
support
of
the
cavalry
advanced
guard
which
had
been
cautiously
following
on
soult
s
track
the
albuera
divisions
were
sad
wrecks
of
their
former
selves
the
had
but
bayonets
in
its
three
brigades
the
about
british
and
portuguese
alten
s
german
brigade
was
less
than
strong
so
that
the
whole
did
not
make
up
much
more
than
men
but
blake
was
requested
to
move
on
feria
and
zafra
parallel
to
the
advance
of
the
british
column
and
did
so
having
collected
a
few
days
provisions
in
his
cantonments
the
whole
force
was
sufficient
to
move
soult
back
since
his
troops
were
in
a
despondent
humour
and
did
not
amount
to
more
than
or
men
for
he
had
been
forced
to
detach
a
brigade
under
gazan
to
escort
his
immense
train
of
wounded
back
to
seville
but
the
allied
infantry
never
came
up
with
the
retreating
french
by
the
time
that
it
had
reached
villalba
and
fuente
del
maestre
soult
was
at
llerena
thirty
miles
ahead
the
last
day
of
his
retreat
was
marked
by
a
vigorous
cavalry
action
the
most
satisfactory
of
its
kind
that
the
british
horse
in
the
peninsula
had
been
engaged
in
since
the
combats
of
sahagun
and
benavente
having
reached
llerena
where
he
intended
to
stop
if
he
were
allowed
soult
determined
to
find
out
what
was
the
force
which
was
pursuing
him
and
more
especially
if
it
were
accompanied
by
infantry
he
instructed
to
turn
back
to
attack
the
allied
horse
and
to
drive
it
in
upon
its
supports
accordingly
the
french
cavalry
general
took
the
four
brigades
of
bron
bouvier
des
éclats
vinot
and
briche
some
sabres
in
all
and
began
to
advance
along
the
he
found
in
villa
garcia
the
enemy
s
advanced
vedettes
composed
of
penne
villemur
s
spaniards
drove
them
out
and
pursued
them
for
five
miles
till
he
came
to
the
town
of
usagre
where
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
supports
in
position
he
had
run
against
the
main
body
of
the
allied
horse
though
he
could
not
make
out
either
its
strength
or
its
intentions
bron
s
brigade
was
composed
of
the
dragoons
bouvier
s
of
the
dragoons
vinot
s
of
the
hussars
and
briche
s
of
the
hussars
and
general
lumley
who
was
thus
thrown
upon
the
defensive
had
with
him
his
three
original
british
cavalry
regiments
dragoon
guards
dragoons
light
dragoons
four
small
regiments
of
madden
s
and
otway
s
portuguese
and
a
detachment
of
penne
villemur
s
spanish
horse
under
general
loy
about
sabres
in
all
so
that
his
position
was
a
dangerous
one
but
the
was
propitious
usagre
lies
on
the
south
bank
of
the
stream
which
flows
in
a
ravine
on
the
north
bank
there
are
two
rolling
heights
a
few
hundred
yards
back
from
the
water
with
a
definite
troops
placed
behind
them
were
invisible
to
an
enemy
coming
up
from
the
town
and
the
french
if
they
wished
to
attack
would
have
to
defile
on
a
narrow
front
first
through
the
main
street
of
usagre
and
then
across
the
bridge
of
the
line
only
squadrons
altogether
and
slightly
over
sabres
apparently
a
squadron
each
of
borbon
and
reyna
the
rest
of
the
spanish
cavalry
being
on
the
monasterio
road
penne
villemur
was
sick
at
villafranca
strength
about
sabres
on
hearing
of
s
approach
lumley
sent
the
light
dragoons
and
otway
s
portuguese
across
the
ravine
to
the
left
of
the
town
and
madden
s
portuguese
in
like
manner
on
the
right
each
using
a
ford
which
had
been
previously
discovered
and
sounded
the
heavy
dragoons
remained
facing
the
town
behind
the
with
lefebure
s
battery
guarding
the
both
the
flanking
forces
reported
that
the
enemy
was
coming
up
the
road
in
great
strength
lumley
was
told
that
thirteen
regiments
had
been
counted
though
there
were
really
only
ten
wherefore
he
ordered
otway
and
madden
to
recross
the
stream
by
their
fords
which
they
did
without
loss
and
to
watch
these
passages
while
keeping
well
under
cover
behind
the
could
not
make
out
the
force
or
the
intentions
of
the
allies
he
had
seen
clearly
only
the
spanish
vedettes
which
he
had
driven
out
of
usagre
but
madden
s
and
otway
s
squadrons
had
not
escaped
notice
altogether
though
they
retired
early
so
that
he
was
aware
that
a
hostile
force
of
some
strength
was
lying
behind
the
heights
he
therefore
resolved
not
to
debouch
from
usagre
along
the
with
his
main
body
across
the
defile
at
the
bridge
till
he
had
got
a
flanking
force
across
the
stream
to
threaten
and
turn
lumley
if
he
were
intending
to
defend
the
line
along
the
water
briche
s
brigade
of
light
horse
was
told
off
for
this
purpose
with
orders
to
go
to
the
right
and
to
pass
the
river
at
the
ford
which
otway
s
portuguese
had
been
seen
to
use
in
their
retreat
meanwhile
the
other
three
french
brigades
waited
in
usagre
deferring
their
advance
till
the
should
have
time
to
get
on
lumley
s
flank
the
two
forces
did
not
keep
touch
briche
went
for
a
mile
along
the
river
and
found
the
ford
but
otway
was
guarding
it
and
he
did
not
like
to
try
the
passage
of
a
steep
ravine
in
face
of
an
enemy
in
position
wherefore
he
moved
further
off
looking
for
a
more
practicable
and
unguarded
crossing
but
the
banks
grew
steeper
and
steeper
as
he
rode
northward
and
he
found
that
he
was
losing
time
he
was
long
absent
and
apparently
committed
the
inexcusable
fault
of
omitting
to
send
any
report
explaining
his
long
delay
after
waiting
for
more
than
an
hour
became
impatient
and
fell
into
an
equally
grave
military
error
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
must
now
be
in
their
destined
position
he
ordered
his
division
of
dragoons
to
debouche
from
the
town
and
cross
the
stream
and
the
defile
bron
s
brigade
led
the
two
regiments
in
front
the
and
trotted
over
the
bridge
and
deployed
on
the
other
side
on
an
ascending
slope
to
cover
the
passage
of
the
remainder
of
the
division
the
third
regiment
of
the
brigade
the
was
just
crossing
the
bridge
when
suddenly
the
whole
in
front
was
covered
with
a
long
line
of
horsemen
charging
downwards
lumley
had
waited
till
the
propitious
moment
and
had
caught
his
enemy
in
a
trap
with
of
his
force
across
the
water
and
the
remainder
jammed
in
the
defile
of
bridge
and
street
the
dragoons
charged
bron
straight
in
front
the
dragoon
guards
took
him
somewhat
in
flank
while
madden
s
portuguese
supported
on
the
right
and
penne
villemur
s
spaniards
on
the
left
the
two
deployed
french
regiments
were
hurled
back
on
the
third
at
the
and
all
three
fell
into
most
lamentable
confusion
the
allies
penetrated
into
the
mass
and
broke
it
to
pieces
with
great
slaughter
the
survivors
unable
to
pass
the
encumbered
bridge
dispersed
right
and
left
far
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
where
they
were
pursued
and
hunted
down
in
detail
could
do
no
more
than
dismount
the
leading
regiment
of
his
second
brigade
and
set
them
to
fire
from
the
houses
along
the
while
four
horse
artillery
guns
opened
upon
the
enemy
s
main
body
but
the
guns
were
promptly
silenced
by
lefebure
s
battery
which
lumley
had
put
in
action
on
the
slope
above
and
had
to
watch
the
destruction
of
bron
s
brigade
without
being
able
to
give
effective
help
more
than
dragoons
were
killed
or
wounded
and
officers
including
the
colonel
of
the
with
men
were
led
away
prisoners
the
british
loss
was
insignificant
not
twenty
troopers
for
the
enemy
had
been
caught
in
a
position
in
which
they
could
offer
no
effective
resistance
lumley
made
no
attempt
to
attack
usagre
town
which
would
indeed
have
been
insane
and
drew
off
at
leisure
with
his
prisoners
sent
to
recall
briche
and
remained
halted
on
his
own
side
of
the
stream
till
evening
lumley
in
his
very
modest
dispatch

the
damage
he
had
done
to
the
enemy

states
his
prisoners
and
notes
that
french

been
counted
but
only
speaks
of
wounded
there
were
really
over
in
combats
with
the
the
number
of
killed
is
always
very
small
compared
with
that
of
the
wounded
which
here
was
about
to
not
at
all

unusual
proportion

the
two
roads
from
badajoz
and
seville
beresford
by
wellington

it

not

that
andalusia
should

the

in

at

in

of
the
left
half
of
the
screen
which
its
advanced
squadrons
supplied

beresford
relinquished
the
command
of
the
separate
army
of

had
been
merged
in
a
larger
unit
when
the
and
divisions
came
up
to

mayor
on
the
wellington
had
announced
his
intention
of
assuming
permanent
charge
of
the
force
in
the
south
which
was
henceforth
considered
as
the
main
army
and
the
seat
of
head
quarters
while
spencer
s
four
divisions
on
the
frontier
of
leon
were
now
to
be
regarded
as
the
subsidiary
force
in
his
letters
home
wellington
spoke
of
beresford
s
removal
from
active
command
in
the
field
as
necessary
because
of
the
unsatisfactory
state
into
which
the
portuguese
army
had
fallen
during
his
absence
his
strong
and
methodical
hand
had
been
much
missed
and
matters
of
detail
had
all
gone
wrong
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
this
was
a
secondary
consideration
the
real
cause
of
his
supersession
was
that
his
chief
had
not
been
satisfied
with
his
conduct
of
the
estremaduran
campaign
in
march
and
april
though
there
were
excuses
and
explanations
to
be
found
for
each
one
of
his
individual
acts
yet
the
general
effect
of
his
leadership
had
not
been
happy
the
best
commentary
on
it
was
that
every
one
from
wellington
to
the
simplest
soldier
in
the
ranks
was
delighted
to
hear
that
rowland
hill
had
landed
at
lisbon
on
may
and
was
on
his
way
to
the
front
to
resume
command
of
the
division
he
was
at
once
placed
in
the
same
position
that
he
had
held
in
entrusted
with
the
command
not
only
of
his
own
division
but
of
the
whole
wing
of
the
army
which
was
detached
to
the
south
the
force
put
at
his
disposition
to
observe
soult
and
cover
the
leaguer
of
badajoz
consisted
of
precisely
the
same
units
that
had
formed
beresford
s
albuera
army
with
the
exception
that
hamilton
s
and
collins
s
portuguese
had
been
drawn
off
to

that

that

and

up
about
men
a
force
even
smaller
than
that
with
which
soult
had
attacked
badajoz
in
january
but
the
french
marshal
had
had
to
deal
with
a
garrison
of
men
while
general
phillipon
the
resourceful
governor
now
in
charge
of
the
place
had
but
a
little
over
a
difference
which
made
wellington
s
position
much
more
advantageous
than
soult
s
had
been
the
cavalry
which
had
come
down
from
the

with

the
hussars
of
the
was
sent
to
join
the
rest
of

and
went
to
form
a
new
brigade
being
added
to
the
light
dragoons
a
regiment
hitherto
unbrigaded
by
june
there
was
another
mounted
corps
to
hand
the
light
dragoons
which
also
went
to
join
lumley
so
that
the
british
cavalry
in
estremadura
rose
from
three
to
six
regiments
during
the
summer
only
two
squadrons
strong
because
the
remainder
of
the
regiment
was
at
cadiz
it
had
as
will
be
remembered
done
good
service
under
graham
at
barrosa
it
arrived
by
june
according
to
atkinson
s
useful
list
of
wellington
s
divisional
organization
there
were
two
deficiencies
however
which
made
wellington
s
task
in
besieging
badajoz
a
hard
nay
an
almost
hopeless
one
his
artillery
material
if
not
so
ludicrously
inadequate
as
that
of
beresford
during
the
first
siege
was
still
utterly
insufficient
and
to
this
we
must
add
that
his
engineer
officers
were
still
both
few
and
unpractised
in
their
art
they
repeated
the
same
mistakes
that
had
been
seen
in
the
early
days
of
may
of
trained
rank
and
file
in
the
engineering
branch
there
were
practically
none
only
royal
military
the
home
authorities
apparently
grudged
sending
out
to
portugal
men
of
this
small
and
highly
trained
corps
and
preferred
to
keep
them
in
england
it
is
impossible
to
speak
with
patience
of
the
fact
that
there
was
not
even
one
company
of
them
in
the
peninsula
after
the
war
had
been
going
on
for
three
years
mulcaster
s
company
the
first
to
arrive
reached
spain
some
weeks
later
by
the
time
of
the
third
siege
of
badajoz
in
there
were
so
many
as
military
artificers
available
it
was
the
miscalculations
of
the
engineers
colonel
fletcher
was
presumably
the
responsible
person
as
wellington
s
chief
technical
adviser
rather
than
the
deplorable
weakness
of
the
artillery
resources
which
made
the
second
british
siege
of
badajoz
as
disastrous
as
the
first
untaught
by
the
experiences
of
the
first
week
in
may
the
engineers
advised
wellington
to
direct
his
efforts
against
the
two
strongest
points
in
the
defences
the
rocky
hill
crowned
by
the
fort
of
san
cristobal
on
one
bank
of
the
guadiana
and
the
castle
on
its
steep
slope
upon
the
other
the
arguments
used
seem
to
have
been
the
same
as
before
time
being
limited
it
was
necessary
to
strike
at
the
most
decisive
points
if
either
san
cristobal
or
the
castle
could
be
breached
and
stormed
the
rest
of
the
fortress
would
be
dominated
and
would
become
untenable
if
on
the
other
hand
one
of
the
southern
fronts
where
the
french
had
made
their
attack
were
to
be
chosen
as
the
objective
the
castle
and
san
cristobal
forming
independent
defences
might
hold
out
long
after
the
enceinte
had
been
pierced
and
carried
moreover
it
was
urged
san
cristobal
was
an
isolated
fort
so
placed
that
it
could
get
no
help
from
the
flank
fires
of
other
works
save
from
a
few
guns
on
the
castle
its
other
neighbour
the
fort
at
the
was
too
to
be
of
any
help
practically
the
only
difference
between
the
engineers
plans
for
the
first
and
the
second
siege
of
badajoz
was
that
in
the
latter
more
attention
was
paid
to
the
attack
on
the
south
side
and
the
whole
force
of
the
besiegers
was
not
concentrated
on
san
cristobal
as
it
had
been
in
early
may
a
serious
attempt
was
made
to
breach
the
castle
not
a
mere
demonstration
or
false
attack
yet
as
matters
turned
out
all
the
stress
of
the
work
once
more
fell
upon
the
san
cristobal
front
where
two
desperate
assaults
were
made
and
repulsed
while
on
the
castle
front
matters
never
got
to
the
point
of
an
attempted
storm
summing
up
the
siege
in
the
words
of
d
urban
beresford
s
chief
of
the
staff
who
watched
it
ruefully
we
can
only
echo
his
conclusion
that
the
fact
is
that
the
engineers
began
upon
the
wrong
side
two
geological
peculiarities
of
the
ground
were
fatal
to
success
the
first
was
that
on
san
cristobal
the
soil
is
so
shallow
three
inches
only
on
top
of
the
hard
rock
that
it
was
impossible
to
construct
proper
trenches
the
second
was
that
the
castle
hill
is
composed
of
a
which
does
not
crumble
however
much
battered
and
that
the
wall
there
was
simply
a
facing
to
the
native
soil
its
stones
might
be
battered
down
but
the
hillside
stood
firm
when
the
stones
had
fallen
and
remained
perpendicular
and
inaccessible
the
latter
fact
could
not
be
known
to
wellington
s
engineers
but
the
former
was
fully
within
their
cognizance
owing
to
their
experience
in
the
first
siege
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
they
ought
to
have
selected
for
battering
the
south
front
either
the
point
where
soult
worked
during
february
or
still
better
the
walls
nearer
the
river
by
the
bastion
of
san
vincente
where
the
ground
is
equally
favourable
and
there
is
no
flanking
external
defence
like
the
pardaleras
fort
if
every
gun
had
been
concentrated
on
this
section
and
every
available
man
set
to
against
it
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
wellington
would
have
got
badajoz
within
the
scant
four
weeks
that
were
at
his
disposal

d
urban
s
diary
under
june
when
the
siege
was
just
developing
into
an
acknowledged
failure
though
the
blockade
had
been
resumed
on
may
the
actual
siege
did
not
recommence
for
some
days
later
since
the
troops
from
the
beira
who
were
to
conduct
it
did
not
get
up
till
a
week
had
passed
on
may
houston
s
division
arrived
from
campo
mayor
and
took
position
on
the
heights
beyond
san
cristobal
they
were
there
joined
by
the
portuguese
from
the
garrison
of
elvas
and
two
regiments
of
algarve
militia
tavira
and
lagos
were
assigned
for
transport
and
convoy
duty
between
the
trenches
and
elvas
picton
and
the
division
came
up
two
days
later
may
crossed
the
guadiana
by
the
ford
above
the
city
and
joined
hamilton
s
portuguese
on
the
southern
bank
an
earlier
arrival
of
the
beira
divisions
would
have
been
of
no
great
use
since
it
was
only
on
the
that
colonel
alexander
dickson
who
had
once
more
been
entrusted
with
the
artillery
arrangements
had
sent
off
his
great
convoy
of
guns
from
elvas
this
time
that
indefatigable
officer
had
collected
a
twice
as
large
as
that
which
he
had
prepared
for
beresford
four
weeks
earlier
there
were
guns
in
all
instead
of
but
unhappily
the
pieces
were
the
same
as
those
used
in
the
first
siege
or
their
equals
in
age
and
defects
the
large
majority
were
the
old
brass
of
the
seventeenth
century
which
had
already
given
so
much
trouble
from
their
irregularity
of
calibre
their
tendency
to
droop
at
the
muzzle
when
much
used
and
their
tiresome
habit
of
unbushing
blowing
out
their
vent
fitting
six
iron
ordered
up
from
lisbon
only
arrived
when
the
siege
was
far
advanced
and
were
the
sole
weapons
of
real
efficiency
with
which
dickson
was
provided
it
is
clear
that
head
quarters
might
have
done
something
in
the
way
of
ordering
up
better
guns
early
in
may
the
moment
that
the
first
siege
had
shown
the
deficiencies
of
the
elvas
museum
of
artillery
antiquities
the
gunners
like
the
guns
were
about
doubled
in
number
since
beresford
s
there
were
now
over
portuguese
and
one
company
of
british
raynsford
s
strong
who
arrived
from
lisbon
on
the
riding
on
mules
which
had
been
provided
at
estremos
to
give
them
a
rapid
journey
to
aid
the
engineers
on
the
spot
eleven
officers
from
line
battalions
had
been
taken
on
as
assistant
engineers
while
the
military
artificers
had
to
train
rank
and
file
selected
from
the
and
divisions
to
act
as
carpenters
miners
and
sappers
the
work
of
these
amateurs
was
as
might
have
been
expected
not
very
satisfactory
and
the
make
of
their
gabions
and
fascines
left
much
to
be
desired
brass
howitzers
ditto
according
to
dickson
s
letter
of
may
see
his
papers
ed
leslie
i
follow
him
rather
than
jones
s
of
the
where
they
differ
as
he
is
absolutely
contemporary
authority
and
was
the
officer
in
charge
of
everything
on
may
the
siege
work
began
by
the
opening
up
of
the
old
trenches
opposite
the
pardaleras
fort
which
the
french
had
filled
in
on
the
day
of
albuera
this
was
merely
done
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
garrison
away
from
the
real
points
of
attack
for
there
was
no
intention
of
approaching
the
place
from
the
south
it
would
have
been
better
for
the
allies
had
this
been
a
genuine
operation
and
if
the
castle
and
san
cristobal
attacks
had
been
false
it
attracted
as
was
intended
much
notice
from
the
garrison
on
the
night
of
the
the
serious
work
began
on
the
castle
side
men
from
the
division
commenced
at
dusk
a
long
trench
on
the
same
ground
that
had
been
dug
over
during
the
first
siege
and
three
zigzag
approaches
to
it
from
the
rear
this
trench
the
first
parallel
was
no
less
than
yards
from
the
castle
the
attention
of
the
enemy
was
so
much
drawn
to
other
points
and
the
soil
was
so
soft
that
by
daybreak
there
had
been
formed
a
trench
yards
long
with
a
parapet
three
feet
high
and
a
depth
of
three
feet
in
the
ground
the
approaches
were
also
well
advanced
on
san
cristobal
at
the
other
attack
everything
went
very
differently
the
ground
chosen
for
the
first
parallel
was
owing
to
the
exigencies
of
the
contour
of
the
hill
only
yards
from
the
fort
the
working
parties
were
discovered
at
once
and
a
heavy
fire
was
directed
on
them
not
only
from
san
cristobal
but
from
the
castle
across
the
river
it
was
found
that
there
was
no
soil
to
dig
in
what
little
once
existed
had
been
used
in
building
the
old
trenches
of
the
first
siege
and
the
french
governor
during
his
days
of
respite
may
had
ingeniously
ordered
that
all
this
earth
should
be
carted
away
and
thrown
down
the
steep
towards
the
river
all
that
could
be
done
was
to
place
a
row
of
gabions
along
the
intended
line
of
trench
and
to
begin
to
bring
up
earth
from
below
to
stuff
them
at
daylight
there
was
not
more
than
two
feet
of
earth
thrown
up
along
the
more
important
points
in
the
parallel
where
it
was
intended
that
three
batteries
should
be
placed
the
enemy
s
fire
soon
knocked
over
the
gabions
and
the
working
parties
had
to
be
withdrawn
from
a
great
part
of
the
front
practically
nothing
had
been
accomplished
and
there
had
been
many
casualties
things
continued
to
go
on
in
the
same
fashion
during
the
succeeding
days
the
parallel
opposite
the
castle
was
easily
completed
with
little
loss
a
great
battery
for
twenty
guns
was
thrown
up
in
the
middle
of
it
and
received
its
pieces
sixteen
brass
and
four
howitzers
on
the
night
of
the
no
attempt
was
made
to
begin
a
second
parallel
nearer
the
castle
from
which
it
could
be
battered
at
short
range
on
the
other
hand
the
san
cristobal
attack
encountered
difficulties
from
the
want
of
soil
the
screen
of
gabions
was
knocked
about
the
two
batteries
opposite
the
fort
made
little
progress
and
the
only
thing
completed
was
a
third
battery
at
the
extreme
edge
of
the
hill
which
was
far
enough
away
to
escape
destruction
but
also
too
far
away
yards
to
do
much
damage
it
seemed
so
hopeless
to
work
on
the
bare
rock
that
wellington
ordered
worth
of
to
be
bought
in
elvas
and
when
these
were
brought
up
on
june
they
proved
impermeable
to
shot
and
a
solid
start
could
be
made
for
the
parapets
of
the
batteries
but
the
enemy
kept
dropping
shells
from
mortars
in
the
castle
among
the
working
parties
with
great
accuracy
and
the
casualties
were
many
on
june
two
small
batteries
for
five
and
eight
guns
respectively
had
at
last
been
erected
about
yards
from
the
fort
and
a
third
behind
them
in
support
for
four
more
guns
which
were
to
shoot
over
the
parallel
at
nine
in
the
morning
of
june
the
batteries
on
both
fronts
began
to
play
on
their
chosen
objectives
the
fire
was
at
first
wild
owing
to
the
eccentric
behaviour
of
the
old
brass
guns
every
one
of
which
had
its
tricks
and
deficiencies
as
the
gunners
began
to
learn
and
humour
them
some
effect
began
to
be
produced
especially
on
the
castle
here
great
flakes
of
masonry
began
to
fall
in
the
evening
but
it
was
noticed
that
behind
the
stone
facing
there
was
a
core
of
the
natural
soil
of
the
castle
hill
which
remained
perpendicular
when
the
masonry
crumbled
on
san
cristobal
the
front
of
the
fort
the
one
selected
for
breaching
was
somewhat
damaged
and
the
guns
nearly
silenced
by
evening
but
the
besiegers
artillery
had
already
begun
to
fall
off
in
strength
only
one
piece
had
been
disabled
by
the
french
but
four
others
had
gone
out
of
action
owing
to
their
own
faults
unbushing
muzzle
drooping
or
carriages
shaken
to
pieces
by
recoil
the
second
day
of
fire
june
was
hardly
more
satisfactory
in
its
results
against
the
castle
the
guns
made
better
practice
so
far
as
accurate
hitting
the
mark
went
but
the
balls
seemed
to
have
no
effect
the
core
of
soil
behind
the
breached
masonry
remained
nearly
as
perpendicular
as
on
the
preceding
evening
shells
fired
against
it
would
not
penetrate
it
wrote
the
disgusted
alexander
dickson
but
absolutely
dropped
back
and
burst
below
among
the
rubbish
meanwhile
one
more
gun
in
this
attack
was
disabled
by
the
french
fire
two
by
muzzle
drooping
and
three
howitzer
carriages
were
so
shaken
that
they
had
to
be
withdrawn
for
repairs
only
thirteen
guns
out
of
the
original
twenty
were
firing
at
sunset
and
the
failure
of
the
old
brass
pieces
was
becoming
so
alarming
that
an
interval
of
seven
to
eight
minutes
was
ordered
between
each
round
to
give
the
metal
time
to
cool
a
new
battery
was
constructed
at
the
right
end
of
the
parallel
near
the
river
at
a
point
somewhat
nearer
to
the
castle
than
the
original
battery
in
the
hope
that
fire
from
a
distance
shorter
by
a
hundred
yards
might
have
better
effect
and
five
guns
were
moved
into
it
under
cover
of
the
night
ed
leslie
jones
of
the
on
san
cristobal
the
second
day
s
fire
was
a
little
better
in
results
the
flank
of
the
fort
which
was
selected
for
breaching
having
its
parapet
knocked
to
pieces
and
much
debris
having
fallen
into
the
ditch
but
unknown
to
the

whose
view
could
not
command
the
bottom
of

the
french
removed
most
of
the
stones
and
rubbish
during
the
night
so
that
the
accumulation
at
the
bottom
on
which
the
practicability
of
the
future
breach
depended
was
much
smaller
than
was
supposed
by
the
british
engineers
two
more
guns
and
two
howitzers
in
this
attack
were
out
of
action
by
the
evening
all
owing
to
their
own
defects
not
to
the
fire
from
the
fort
the
batteries
were
much
incommoded
by
an
enfilading
fire
across
the
river
from
the
castle
where
some
guns
had
been
placed
on
a
high
cavalier
to
bear
on
the
slopes
below
cristobal
on
june
affairs
went
on
much
in
the
same
style
the
breaching
of
the
castle
was
an
absolute
failure
the
practice
was
extremely
good
but
the
bank
of
earth
at
the
breach
still
remained
perpendicular
it
was
discovered
however
that
the
french
were
so
far
alarmed
at
the
results
of
the
battering
that
they
were
constructing
elaborate
inner
retrenchments
behind
the
breach
on
cristobal
the
prospects
looked
more
promising
so
much
of
the
wall
as
was
visible
over
the
edge
of
the
ditch
along
the
attacked
front
was
demolished
for
a
distance
of
many
yards
with
another
day
s
fire
it
was
decided
that
the
breach
would
be
practicable
jones
of
the
this
decision
was
the
result
of
the
report
of
an
engineer
officer
lieutenant
forster
who
crept
up
to
the
edge
of
the
ditch
during
the
night
of
the
and
saw
much
rubble
therein
accordingly
the
batteries
on
both
sides
of
the
river
thundered
away
for
the
whole
day
on
the
the
castle
attack
with
fourteen
guns
out
of
its
original
twenty
the
cristobal
attack
with
seventeen
remaining
out
of
on
the
former
front
the
results
were
somewhat
more
satisfactory
than
those
of
the
three
first
days
of
battering
the
seam
in
the
castle
wall
appearing
much
wider
and
the
accumulation
of
rubbish
at
its
foot
beginning
to
look
appreciable
observers
in
the
trenches
held
that
a
single
man
climbing
unhindered
might
get
up
to
the
top
but
of
course
there
was
a
great
difference
between
such
a
scrambling
place
and
a
practicable
nothing
at
any
rate
could
yet
be
done
on
this
side
in
the
way
of
assault
there
were
it
must
be
remembered
yards
of
open
ground
between
the
parallel
from
which
a
must
start
and
the
foot
of
the
damaged
wall
not
to
speak
of
the
muddy
bed
of
the
rivillas
brook
which
had
to
be
forded
in
order
to
reach
the
castle
hill
the
san
cristobal
breach
on
the
other
hand
was
judged
ripe
for
assault
though
the
condition
of
its
lower
part
was
not
accurately
known
according
to
french
accounts
it
was
probably
practicable
at
dusk
but
the
moment
that
night
fell
sixty
men
went
down
into
the
ditch
and
began
clearing
away
the
débris
with
such
energy
that
there
was
a
sheer
drop
once
more
at
midnight
between
the
bottom
of
the
excavation
and
the
lip
of
the
battered
wall
above
it
the
garrison
also
stuffed
up
the
breach
with
de
and
carts
turned
upside
down
and
jammed
together
while
the
sappers
in
the
fort
prepared
a
quantity
of
bombs
to
be
thrown
by
hand
into
the
ditch
when
an
assault
should
be
made
it
is
probable
that
the
delay
of
over
four
hours
between
dark
and
midnight
when
the
storm
came
just
sufficed
to
provide
defences
strong
enough
to
render
the
attack
hopeless
the

as
fast
as
was

in

up
the
yards
of

which
separated

detected

at

with

with

from

they
stood

they
saw
that

itself
had
been
stopped
with

their

called
them
off
and
they
were
retiring
with
little
loss
when
the
main
body
of
the
storming
party
came
leaping
down
into
the
ditch
getting
news
that
the
breach
was
impracticable
the
officers
in
command
of
the
two
grenadier

made
a
gallant

series
of
attempts
to
escalade

unbreached
parts

the

round
to
several
other
points
of

in

for
a
place

with

kept
rolling
down

a
sufficient
testimony
to
the
obstinacy
of
the

how
hopeless
it
was
may
be
judged
from
the
fact
that
the
french
had

to
have

the

result
of
these

three
days
of
bombardment
on
the
castle
side
was
still
unsatisfactory
the
had
at
last
brought
down
a
good
deal
of
earth
and
rubble
which
was
lying
in
a
heap
at
the
foot
of
the
battered
wall
but
on
each
of
the
mornings
of
the
and
it
was
found
that
the
french
had
during
the
dark
hours
scarped
the
front
of
the
breach
and
thrown
aside
so
much
of
the
débris
that
there
was
still
a
perpendicular
face
of
six
or
seven
feet
high
between
the
top
of
the
heap
of
broken
earth
and
masonry
and
the
bottom
of
the
seam
of
broken
wall
this
work
had
been
carried
out
by
the
garrison
under
great
difficulties
for
the
british
batteries
had
been
throwing
grape
against
the
foot
of
the
breach
all
night
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
any
such
activity
but
the
french
trusting
to
the
cover
of
the
darkness
had
continued
to
work
on
manfully
and
though
some
men
were
hit
the
task
had
on
each
night
been
more
or
less
carried
out
on
the
the
engineers
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
dared
not
advise
any
attempt
to
storm
on
this
side
considering
the
enormous
distance
yards
from
the
wall
at
which
the
columns
of
attack
would
have
to
start
even
if
they
debouched
from
the
part
of
the
parallel
which
was
nearest
to
the
castle
there
was
also
the
bed
of
the
rivillas
to
cross
and
the
guns
from
that
part
of
the
castle
which
was
uninjured
and
from
the
flank
of
san
cristobal
would
cut
up
the
stormers
by
enfilading
fire
the
engineers
reluctantly
concluded
that
nothing
could
be
done
against
the
castle
till
san
cristobal
had
fallen
or
till
a
second
parallel
had
been
pushed
forward
much
nearer
to
the
place
this
was
a
confession
that
all
their
original
plans
had
been
erroneous
and
that
the
immense
store
of
shot
and
shell
lavished
on
the
castle
breach
had
been
wasted
all
therefore
depended
on
the
result
of
a
second
attempt
to
storm
san
cristobal
here
there
were
now
two
breaches
a
large
and
a
small
one
the
parapets
were
completely
knocked
to
pieces
and
the
fort
looked
a
mere
battered
heap
its
fire
had
been
nearly
silenced
so
much
so
that
not
a
single
casualty
occurred
in
the
trench
before
it
during
the
last
twelve
hours
of
bombardment
nevertheless
the
breaches
were
not
very
practicable
for
here
as
at
the
castle
the
garrison
had
by
hard
work
during
the
nights
cleared
away
great
part
of
the
débris
below
the
breach
they
could
not
be
prevented
from
doing
so
because
the
besiegers
batteries
were
so
far
away
that
they
were
unable
to
command
the
dead
ground
in
the
bottom
of
the
ditch
on
each
morning
the
battered
parapet
was
found
to
have
been
replaced
with
sandbags
and
and
the
breach
itself
stopped
with
de
these
were
swept
away
again
by
continual
battering
both
on
the
and
the
but
the
gallant
garrison
began
to
replace
them
on
each
evening
the
moment
that
dusk
fell
nor
could
this
be
prevented
because
contrary
to
all
the
rules
of
siegecraft
the
besiegers
had
not
sapped
up
close
enough
to
the
walls
to
enable
them
to
prevent
repairs
from
being
carried
out
general
phillipon
had
doubled
the
garrison
of
the

which
now
consisted
of
two
companies
instead
of
the
one
that
had
held
it

furnished
with

muskets

and
a
great
store
of
grenades
and

shell

for

been
sent
up
into
the
work
the
division
delivered
its
second
assault
on
the
night
of
the
three
hours
earlier
than
on
the
previous
occasion
and
only
ninety
minutes
after
dark
had
fallen
this
moment
had
been
chosen
in
order
that
the
french
might
have
less
time
to
do
repairs
but
nine
o
clock
was
still
too
late
an
hour
rough
preparations
to
receive
the
stormers
had
already
been
made
when
they
arrived
the
french
narratives
state
that
an
assault
by
daylight
in
the
late
afternoon
would
have
been
much
more
likely
to
succeed
but
this
idea
though
it
had
been
mooted
in
the
english
camp
was
rejected
because
of
the
distance
which
the
attacking
column
would
have
to
advance
fully
visible
in
the
open
under
fire
and
uphill
once
more
the
fact
that
the
parallel
was
too
far
from
the
fort
had
become
all
important
as
a
hindrance
on
the
san
cristobal
heights
approaches
could
not
be
driven
any
nearer
for
want
of
earth
to
dig
in
this
had
been
known
from
the
first
and
should
have
been
held
sufficient
reason
for
not
attacking
at
all

this
stony
height

of

were

knocked
over

tried
to
ascend

the
few
who
got
a

in

were
met

by

showed
splendid
courage
running
down

charging
any

an
attack
could
hardly
succeed
when
the
column
had
to
cross
yards
of
exposed
ground
before
reaching
the
fort
and
that
a
storm
should
never
have
been
tried
when
the
besieger
had
not
sapped
up
to
the
edge
of
the
ditch
and
placed
himself
in
a
position
to
command
it
it
may
be
mentioned
that
such
a
ditch
as
this
hewn
in
the
live
rock
and
very
deep
was
particularly
hard
to
deal
with
its
edges
could
not
become
abraded
and
it
was
easy
for
the
defenders
to
shovel
away
the
débris
that
fell
into
it
because
the
bottom
was
solid
and
hard
and
the
masonry
that
had
been
knocked
down
lay
on
it
instead
of
sinking
into
its
floor
on
the
morning
of
the
the
fire
against
the
castle
was
continued
with
vigour
but
on
san
cristobal
there
was
a
six
hours
truce
which
was
asked
and
granted
in
order
that
the
many
wounded
scattered
along
the
slope
below
the
fort
might
be
gathered
in
the
french
being
able
to
work
unmolested
at
repairs
during
the
cessation
of
fire
had
every
reason
for
giving
a
polite
and
humane
answer
to
the
request
made
by
the
besiegers
everything
seemed
now
to
depend
on
the
attack
against
the
castle
since
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
had
come
to
such
a
disastrous
conclusion
the
fire
of
the
newly
arrived
iron
was
still
very
effective
and
the
breach
looked
larger
and
less
steep
in
fact
french
accounts
state
that
it
was
now
for
the
first
time
thoroughly
practicable
but
it
was
yards
from
the
british
parallel
and
the
artillery
on
the
neighbouring
bastions
and
even
on
the
castle
itself
was
still
intact
phillipon
was
in
no
wise
freed
from
care
by
the
successful
repulse
of
the
two
attempts
to
storm
san
cristobal
he
had
just
had
to
reduce
his
troops
to
and
even
on
this
scale
there
were
only
ten
days
more
of
food
in
the
place
no
provisions
had
been
got
in
since
beresford
s
first
siege
began
in
april
the
garrison
though
its
losses
in
killed
and
wounded
had
not
been
great
had
many
sick
and
the
strain
of
being
constantly
under
arms
expecting
an
assault
was
beginning
to
be
felt
there
was
no
news
from
outside
save
that
brought
by
two
or
three
deserters
from
the
foreign
corps
in
the
british
division
who
reported
that
soult
was
still
in
the
sierra
morena
and
that
they
had
heard
nothing
of
the
approach
of
a
relieving
army
though
there
was
a
rumour
that
victor
was
going
to
raise
the
siege
of
cadiz
in
order
to
join
his
chief
phillipon
was
forced
to
contemplate
the
double
possibility
of
his
provisions
running
short
and
of
a
successful
assault
on
the
castle
front
wherefore
he
resolved
that
preparations
should
be
made
to
bring
off
the
garrison
by
a
sally
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
if
no
relief
came
or
if
the
walls
were
forced
the
whole
available
body
of
his
men
were
to
cross
the
river
to
the
cristobal
side
under
cover
of
the
night
and
to
dash
at
the
lines
of
the
besiegers
in
order
to
cut
their
way
through
by
the
road
to
montijo
and
merida
but
this
was
not
to
be
tried
before
the
day
of
absolute
necessity
should
arrive
the
council
of
war
called
by
the
governor
decided
that
the
topic
of
evasion
need
not
be
broached
for
five
days
more
before
those
five
days
had
expired
they
were
out
of
danger
and
sure
of
relief
lamare

cf
lamare
it
was
at
noon
on
june
that
wellington
made
up
his
mind
that
the
siege
must
be
abandoned
calling
together
the
divisional
commanders
and
the
senior
officers
of
artillery
and
engineers
he
gave
them
a
short
address
it
had
been
proved
he
said
that
it
was
impossible
to
storm
san
cristobal
without
sapping
up
to
the
crest
of
the
glacis
which
was
a
practically
impossible
task
on
the
bare
rock
there
was
now
a
breach
in
the
castle
but
it
was
too
remote
from
the
parallel
and
the
route
to
it
was
commanded
both
by
the
guns
on
the
flank
of
san
cristobal
and
those
on
the
lunette
of
san
roque
and
other
parts
of
the
southern
enceinte
it
was
known
that
it
had
been
elaborately
retrenched
behind
by
ditches
and
palisades
but
these
were
not
his
sole
or
the
main
reasons
for
stopping
the
siege
he
had
news
that
marmont
and
the
corps
would
both
join
soult
in
a
few
days
and
the
allied
army
must
not
be
caught
in
the
trenches
and
forced
to
fight
superior
numbers
in
an
unfavourable
position
it
would
be
possible
to
stop
five
days
more
and
to
continue
the
battering
for
that
time
but
on
the
the
french
armies
might
be
concentrated
and
a
general
action
forced
upon
him
this
he
would
not
risk
but
had
decided
to
order
the
whole
to
be
withdrawn
into
elvas
at
once
while
the
army
would
keep
up
the
blockade
of
badajoz
till
the
enemy
drew
near
and
would
then
retire
beyond
the
guadiana
at
its
leisure
and
take
up
a
position
on
the
portuguese
frontier
which
he
had
already
chosen
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
the
guns
should
be
withdrawn
from
the
batteries
and
the
sending
of
stores
tools
back
to
elvas
must
commence
he
would
have
risked
a
couple
of
days
more
battering
if
he
had
thought
it
likely
to
lead
to
a
storm
but
it
was
his
opinion
that
there
was
no
prospect
of
immediate
success
against
the
place
and
he
was
therefore
resolved
to
give
up
the
siege
even
before
he
was
actually
forced
to
do
so
rumour
adds
that
he
muttered
more
or
less
to
himself
that
next
time
he
would
be
his
own
engineer
but
he
did
not
speak
publicly
in
censure
of
the
mistakes
of
fletcher
and
his
colleagues
the
men
who
had
planned
and
built
the
lines
of
torres
vedras
were
not
to
be
disgraced
lightly
even
if
they
had
failed
in
their
last
task
see
burgoyne
s
there
is
an
account
current
that
his
lordship
says
if
he
undertakes
another
siege
he
will
be
his
own
engineer
whatever
faults
were
committed
at
badajoz
i
suspect
he
was
not
aware
of
them
and
i
think
it
very
doubtful
whether
he
even
knows
them
now
it
appears
to
me
probable
that
he
say
so
by
the
mystery
affected
about
the
engineer
head
quarters
respecting
the
burgoyne
an
engineer
with
his
feelings
hurt
wellington
s
intelligence
the
approaching
concentration
of
the
french
armies
had
been
very
carefully
watched
by
wellington
who
was
in
constant
touch
with
spencer
and
had
been
keeping
a
most
vigilant
eye
on
all
his
reports
he
had
also
been
helped
by
several
intercepted
dispatches
taken
on
the
way
between
the
armies
of
portugal
and
andalusia
and
by
reports
from
the
guerrillero
chiefs
of
castile
and
his
own
secret
correspondents
in
salamanca
marmont
had
been
much
more
rapid
in
his
movements
and
had
shown
more
willingness
to
help
a
colleague
in
distress
than
was
usual
among
the
french
commanders
in
spain
he
was
new
to
command
and
very
zealous
it
is
certain
that
a
year
later
when
he
had
gained
more
experience
of
with
soult
he
would
not
come
so
fast
and
so
eagerly
to
his
aid
the
duke
of
ragusa
had
conducted
the
army
of
portugal
back
to
salamanca
on
may
and
had
as
has
been
already
related
spent
the
next
fortnight
in
breaking
up
the
old
corps
into
six
new
divisions
of
infantry
and
five
brigades
of
cavalry
the
regiments
had
all
sent
back
to
france
the
cadres
of
their
battalions
and
their
and
squadrons
the
infantry
battalions
had
been
completed
up
to
about
men
each
and
the
six
divisions
had
by
may
about
men
present
with
the
colours
besides
sick
and
detachments
who
were
very
numerous
there
were
only
cavalry
fit
for
service
and
six
batteries
of
artillery
great
drafts
of
horses
were
promised
from
france
by
which
it
was
hoped
that
the
former
would
ere
long
be
able
to
show
sabres
and
the
latter
to
put
guns
in
the
field
meanwhile
there
were
not
more
than
men
of
all
arms
fit
to
march
see

these
figures
given
by
marmont
in
his
iv
pp
are
borne
out
by
the
official

bessières
writes
to
berthier
on
may
that
he
has
men
of
the
army
of
portugal
convalescents
and
drafts
in
his
government
who
could
be
sent
forward
if
there
were
officers
to
take
charge
of
them
in
reality
the
figures
were
even
greater
there
were
also
some
sick
in
the
hospitals
of
the
army
at
salamanca
soult
before
starting
on
his
albuera
campaign
had
written
to
masséna
whose
deposition
was
unknown
to
him
to
state
that
if
he
failed
in
his
attempt
to
deliver
badajoz
at
the
head
of
his
own
expeditionary
force
he
might
have
to
ask
for
aid
from
the
army
of
portugal
this
letter
was
delivered
to
marmont
on
may
when
he
had
just
assumed
command
he
replied
may
that
he
recognized
the
importance
of
badajoz
and
would
move
all
or
a
part
of
his
army
southward
if
it
were
really
required
soult
received
the
dispatch
from
the
hands
of
his
colleague
s
fabvier
at
llerena
on
may
and
was
overjoyed
at
its
contents
he
wrote
to
acknowledge
the
offer
in
terms
of
effusive
politeness
and
begged
marmont
to
march
not
with
a
detachment
but
with
his
whole
army
though
he
was
expecting
to
be
joined
by
drouet
and
the
corps
within
ten
days
he
was
doubtful
whether
that
reinforcement
would
make
him
strong
enough
to
face
wellington
but
with
men
of
the
army
of
portugal
placed
in
the
valley
of
the
guadiana
there
would
be
a
force
amply
sufficient
to
sweep
the
allies
back
into
portugal
on
hearing
that
marmont
had
started
he
would
extend
his
troops
toward
merida
where
the
head
of
his
colleague
s
column
coming
by
truxillo
and
almaraz
would
probably
appear
soult
to
marmont
may
printed
in
marmont
s
iv
it
contains
much
rhodomontade
on
the
successful
action
of
albuera
to
which
marmont
appends
a
caustic
note
excellente
plaisanterie
que
de
représenter

une
victoire
une
bataille
offensive
dont
le
but
n
a
pas

long
before
soult
s
llerena
dispatch
came
to
hand
marmont
had
already
begun
to
move
some
of
his
divisions
towards
the
tagus
as
a
precautionary
measure
in
case
his
offer
should
be
accepted
but
it
was
apparently
the
news
of
albuera
which
made
him
resolve
to
betake
himself
to
estremadura
with
every
available
man
and
not
soult
s
appeal
which
only
reached
him
after
he
had
started
he
was
anxious
to
hand
over
the
charge
of
the
whole
frontier
of
leon
and
of
the
fortress
of
ciudad
rodrigo
to
bessières
but
the
duke
of
istria
protested
in
the
most
vehement
style
against
having
this
responsibility
thrust
upon
him
until
he
had
learnt
of
the
albuera
check
he
kept
preaching
to
mortier
on
the
text
that
soult
was
well
able
to
take
care
of
himself
and
ought
to
draw
rather
on
drouet
and
madrid
for
reinforcements
than
on
the
army
of
portugal
marmont
might
move
a
division
to
baños
and
bejar
and
two
more
to
plasencia
but
this
was
all
that
honour
and
prudence
demanded
the
main
body
of
his
troops
ought
to
be
left
in
or
near
salamanca
to
observe
the
british
force
in
front
of
ciudad
rodrigo
the
army
of
the
north
could
not
spare
a
man
to
relieve
marmont
s
troops
on
the
douro
and
the
tormes
if
they
marched
away
what
with
the
galicians
the
cantabrian
bands
of
longa
and
porlier
and
the
guerrilleros
it
had
so
much
upon
its
hands
that
it
could
not
find
one
brigade
to
occupy
salamanca
the
army
of
portugal
was
so
much
in
need
of
rest
and
reinforcement
that
it
would
perish
by
the
way
or
never
reach
badajoz
if
its
commander
persisted
in
carrying
out
his
quixotic
plan
all
these
arguments
were
hollow
bessières
disliked
soult
and
not
only
would
not
stir
a
finger
himself
to
aid
him
but
wished
to
discourage
marmont
from
doing
so
when
the
news
of
albuera
came
he
made
shift
to
protect
the
frontiers
of
leon
despite
of
all
his
previous
allegations
his
estimate
of
the
impossibility
of
the
march
to
badajoz
was
absolutely
falsified
the
army
of
portugal
accomplished
it
in
fifteen
days
without
any
appreciable
loss
in
men
or
material
marmont
deserves
as
he
himself
remarks
great
credit
for
his
move
which
was
made
contrary
to
his
colleague
s
advice
and
without
any
orders
from
paris
for
napoleon
s
dispatches
based
as
usual
on
facts
three
weeks
or
a
month
old
were
coming
in
at
this
time
with
notes
as
to
the
resting
and
reorganization
of
the
army
and
spoke
of
a
battle
near
ciudad
rodrigo
to
keep
wellington
from
besieging
that
place
as
the
next
task
which
would
probably
fall
to
the
duke
of
ragusa
marmont
had
as
directions
nothing
but
a
vague
precept
to
act
for
the
general
interest
of
the
imperial
armies
in
spain
and
to
keep
an
eye
on
andalusia
where
the
progress
of
affairs
would
be
better
known
to
him
than
it
could
be
in
paris
these
directions
he
most
certainly
carried
out
but
on
his
own
responsibility
and
without
any
detailed
instructions
from
his
master
indeed
his
dispatch
of
may
in
which
he
informed
the
emperor
that
he
was
about
to
march
for
the
tagus
brought
down
on
him
a
scolding
from
berthier
for
moving
with
only
pieces
of
artillery
and
for
not
having
sent
back
to
bayonne
a
mass
of
men
of
the
train
who
were
to
pick
up
horses
there
if
marmont
had
waited
to
procure
more
teams
from
the
rear
he
would
never
have
joined
soult
in
time
to
raise
the
siege
of
badajoz
it
was
the
quickness
of
his
movement
which
forced
the
allies
to
abandon
that
enterprise
iv

wellington
had
been
from
the
first
convinced
that
marmont
would
move
southward
on
hearing
of
soult
s
check
at
albuera
it
was
for
this
reason
that
he
made
no
scruple
of
depleting
spencer
s
corps
of
reinforcements
for
the
army
in
estremadura
not

detachments
but
probably
the
whole
force
would
ere
long
have
to
be
drawn
to
join
the
main
army
on
may
as
has
been
already
mentioned
he
ordered
howard
s
british
and
ashworth
s
portuguese
brigades
to
move
towards
him
via
sabugal
castello
branco
and
the
bridge
of
villa
velha
howard
s
men
were
to
be
taken
away
permanently
from
the
division
and
added
to
the
second
replacing
in
it
three
battalions
which
owing
to
the
carnage
of
albuera
had
to
be
sent
home
to
recruit
by
june
howard
had
reached
talavera
real
near
badajoz
and
had
formally
been
placed
on
the
roll
of
the
division
which
then
rose
once
more
to

howard
s
brigade
consisted
of

and
a
rifle

of
the
the
battalions
which
went
home
were
the
in
compliance
with
his
chief
s
general
directions
that
if
the
french
army
of
portugal
turned
southward
he
himself
was
to
make
a
corresponding
movement
spencer
moved
the
light
and
divisions
from
their
cantonments
towards
sabugal
on
a
rumour
which
turned
out
to
be
premature
that
marmont
had
already
started
on
the
of
may
learning
that
he
had
been
misinformed
he
brought
them
back
again
to
their
old
cantonments
between
the
azava
and
the
coa
on
the
on
the
next
day
there
arrived
detailed
and
certain
news
from
secret
correspondents
in
salamanca
to
the
effect
that
marmont
was
concentrating
his
troops
in
two
bodies
one
under
his
own
command
at
salamanca
itself
the
other
about
alba
de
tormes
and
tamames
the
natural
deduction
from
this
information
was
that
one
column
would
march
by

by
ciudad
rodrigo
and
the
puerto
de
perales
wellington
on
receiving
the
spanish
notes
forwarded
by
spencer
was
delighted
to
find
that
his
forecast
was
almost
certainly
right
you
will
see
by
my
letter
yesterday
he
wrote
on
june
that
i
did
not
make
a
bad
guess
at
the
enemy
s
probable
movement
as
described
in
the
letters
from
our
friends
of
the
enclosed
in
yours
of
the
his
own
dispatch
of
june
to
which
he
refers
had
already
told
spencer
that
the
moment
marmont
moved
he
was
to
bring
up
his
right
to
penamacor
and
his
left
to
sabugal
leaving
only
a
screen
in
front
of
ciudad
rodrigo
but
since
it
was
not
quite
certain
that
the
marshal
might
not
be
projecting
a
mere
raid
into
the
beira
either
by
the
almeida
or
the
sabugal
road
no
definite
move
was
to
be
made
till
it
was
clear
that
the
french
columns
were
heading
for
the
passes
this
caution
against
deductions
kept
spencer
very
much
in
his
original
position
till
june
the
day
on
which
marmont
s
movements
became
clear
light
division
diaries
simmons
show
these
to
be
the
correct
days
wellington
to
spencer
of
june
vii
the
marshal
had
concentrated
one
division
foy
s
and
all
his
cavalry
at
salamanca
on
june
while
reynier
with
two
divisions
followed
at
a
day
s
distance
by
three
more
moved
from
tamames
for
the
eastern
pass
the
puerto
de
baños
on
the
the
marshal
and
the
smaller
column
started
from
salamanca
on
the
rodrigo
road
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
demonstration
against
almeida
which
was
intended
to
hold
spencer
in
his
present
position
while
reynier
and
the
main
body
of
the
french
army
should
get
two
or
three
days
start
marmont
reached
rodrigo
on
the
and
sallied
out
from
it
cavalry
in
front
on
the
following
morning
he
was
exposing
himself
to
some
danger
since
spencer
had
four
divisions
within
call
though
his
cavalry
was
weak
only
two
british
and
two
portuguese
regiments
but
uncertain
as
to
the
strength
of
his
enemy
spencer
gave
way
the
light
division
and
slade
s
cavalry
being
drawn
back
from
the
line
of
the
azava
while
the
other
three
divisions
marched
for
sabugal
under
the
cover
of
this
screen
the
road
to
almeida
being
thus
left
unguarded
pack
who
was
lying
there
with
his
portuguese
brigade
blew
up
such
part
of
the
enceinte
as
remained
intact
after
brennier
s
explosion
and
retired
westward
for
this
both
he
and
spencer
were
blamed
by
wellington
who
said
that
they
should
have
waited
till
the
french
actually
made
a
move
towards
almeida
before
destroying
it
its
subsequent
repair
was
made
much
more
difficult
by
the
supplementary
damage
needlessly
carried
out
marmont
says
only
one
division
and
i
follow
him
here
as
the
best
authority
though
foy
in
his
says
two
divisions
slade
s
and
barbaçena
s
brigades
the
other
british
cavalry
brigade
anson
s
had
marched
for
the
south
on
june
and
was
at
this
moment
at
caria
near
castello
branco
wellington
was
still
more
angry
with
spencer
for
authorizing
pack
to
blow
up
the
place
for
the
brigadier
had
very
properly
asked
definite
leave
to
do
so
from
his
immediate
superior
wellington
argued
that
a
proper
reading
of
his
dispatches
would
have
showed
spencer
that
the
destruction
was
only
to
be
made
in
case
marmont
actually
marched
on
almeida
see
viii
marmont
s
force
foot
and
cavalry
advanced
in
pursuit
of
spencer
by
both
the
gallegos
and
the
carpio
roads
it
was
only
on
the
latter
however
that
any
serious
skirmishing
occurred
montbrun
s
squadrons
in
overwhelming
numbers
pressed
hard
on
the
british
cavalry
screen
composed
on
this
front
of
the
dragoons
and
a
squadron
of
the
light
dragoons
under
slade
that
brigadier
always
if
his
subordinates
are
to
be
trusted
a
little
in
movement
allowed
himself
to
be
outflanked
while
executing
a
series
of
demonstrations
to
cover
the
rear
of
the
infantry
and
only
got
off
without
serious
loss
through
the
gallantry
of
a
squadron
of
the
royals
who
charged
the
turning
force
at
an
opportune
moment
and
gained
time
for
the
rest
of
the
regiment
to
retire
with
some
difficulty
across
the
marsh
of
nava
de
aver
a
dangerous
movement
was
got
over
with
the
loss
of
only
four
men
killed
and
nine
wounded
see

iii
ainslie
s
of
the
pp
tomkinson
spencer
s
whole
force
had
reached
alfayates
by
the
night
of
the
retiring
before
a
french
column
of
not
a
third
of
its
own
strength
on
the
next
day
he
received
from
colonel
waters
one
of
wellington
s
great
intelligence
officers
news
which
cleared
up
the
situation
for
him
waters
who
came
in
from
a
tour
in
the
sierra
de
gata
reported
that
an
immense
french
column
was
already
passing
the
puerto
de
baños
thirty
miles
to
the
east
and
that
the
force
in
front
of
the
british
did
not
apparently
exceed
the
single
division
of
infantry
and
the
four
brigades
of
horse
which
had
been
already
seen
and
noted
there
was
no
need
therefore
to
retire
towards
the
zezere
and
the
estrada
nova
for
marmont
was
not
making
a
serious
raid
into
portugal
but
only
covering
the
march
of
his
main
body
by
a
demonstration
the
truth
of
this
intelligence
was
soon
verified
for
the
marshal
instead
of
pressing
the
british
rear
on
the
wheeled
eastward
and
went
off
by
the
pass
of
perales
leaving
spencer
entirely
unmolested
wellington
s
original
orders
thus
became
valid
and
practicable
and
spencer
was
able
to
march
his
whole
four
divisions
towards
badajoz
and
the
main
army
with
the
certainty
that
he
was
moving
parallel
to
marmont
s
route
and
that
he
could
join
his
chief
many
days
before
the
french
columns
could
unite
with
soult
for
the
invaluable
bridge
of
villa
velha
now
became
of
primary
importance
it
provided
a
good
passage
over
the
tagus
leading
straight
to
estremadura
by
a
short
line
while
the
french
having
no
bridge
lower
down
the
river
than
almaraz
were
compelled
to
make
a
much
longer
detour
and
to
spend
several
days
more
than
the
british
in
transferring
themselves
to
the
southern
seat
of
war
the
head
of
spencer
s
marching
column
was
now
formed
by
anson
s
light
cavalry
who
had
moved
as
it
will
be
remembered
towards
castello
branco
before
the
rest
of
the
army
then
came
the
infantry
divisions
while
slade
remained
to
cover
the
rear
and
only
marched
on
when
the
main
body
had
already
crossed
the
tagus
the
route
lay
from
alfayates
by
penamacor
são

the

on

division
on

s
cavalry
who
had
waited
behind
near
castello
branco
till
it
should
be
certain
that
no
french
were
showing
in
this
direction
only
came
over
the
river
on
the
all
this
was
rough
marching
in
hot
weather
over
bad
roads
and
the
troops
suffered
somewhat
from
sunstroke
and
from
occasional
lack
of
water
in
the
mountains
but
the
transport
worked
fairly
well
in
spite
of
all
difficulties
and
food
only
once
failed
to
be
distributed
regularly
by
dint
of
moving
as
far
as
was
possible
in
the
early
morning
and
the
evening
hours
the
divisions
made
good
time
and
the
distances
covered
exceeded
on
several
days
twenty
miles
in
the
hours
see
napier
says
that
spencer
on
his
southern
march
detached
a
division
and
his
cavalry
to
coria
as
flankers
iii
i
think
this
statement
that
the
british
was
pushed
forward
into
spain
is
an
error
caused
by
the
similarity
of
names
between
the
spanish
coria
and
caria
in
portugal
between
sabugal
and
castello
branco
for
it
is
certain
that
anson
s
cavalry
brigade
were
at
caria
june
and
then
went
on
to
castello
branco
and
villa
velha
while
slade
s
cavalry
were
from
the
to
the
between
alfayates
and
castello
branco
see
the
regimental
histories
see
leach
napier
s
statement
iii
that
the
light
division
did
not
leave
a
single
straggler
behind
is
contradicted
by
the
note
of
leach
of
the
that
on
june
many
hundreds
of
men
were
left
by
the
wayside
quite
exhausted
by
the
intense
heat
which
compelled
us
to
make
frequent
halts
by
day
and
to
proceed
by
tomkinson
also
notes
that
the
light
division
lost
men
who
fell
dead
from
sunstroke
while
marching
up
the
steep
ascent
to
niza
on
june
he
says
that
the
light
division
men
were
so
willing
that
they
marched
on
till
the
last
possible
moment
and
reeled
over
to
die
on
the
the
head
of
the
infantry
column
was
at
niza
only
twenty
miles
from
portalegre
and
fifty
from
badajoz
while
its
rear
had
passed
castello
branco
and
was
nearing
the
tagus
wellington
was
therefore
able
to
contemplate
the
situation
with
serenity
spencer
s
whole
force
would
be
able
to
join
him
long
before
marmont
could
unite
with
soult
he
ordered
that
each
of
the
divisions
as
it
reached
portalegre
should
take
several
days
rest
before
moving
on
to
campo
mayor
and
elvas
the
french
army
meanwhile
had
endured
a
much
longer
and
more
fatiguing
march
the
head
of
reynier
s
column
moving
by
fuente
roble
baños
and
bejar
across
the
chain
of
the
sierra
de
gata
reached
plasencia
on
the
and
almaraz
on
the
marmont
and
the
smaller
column
which
had
demonstrated
against
spencer
fell
into
the
rear
of
the
main
body
at
malpartida
near
plasencia
on
the
the
passage
of
the
tagus
at
almaraz
took
longer
than
had
been
expected
because
pontoons
which
had
been
ordered
down
from
madrid
had
failed
to
appear
and
the
whole
army
had
to
be
ferried
over
by
driblets
on
the
already
existing
there
but
though
strung
out
over
fifty
miles
of
road
by
this
mischance
the
army
of
portugal
at
least
got
the
advanced
squadrons
of
its
light
cavalry
to
truxillo
on
the
and
to
merida
on
the
the
head
of
the
infantry
column
was
a
day
s
march
behind
and
reached

on

with
the
main
body
trailing
down
the
mountain
road
from
truxillo
behind
it
soult
s
advanced
guard
was
already
in
possession
of
the
town
and
bridge
of
merida
and
the
junction
of
the
armies
of
andalusia
and
portugal
was
secured
foy
s
ed
girod
de
l
ain
according
to
a
report
brought
to
wellington
by
a
british
in
that
direction
as
early
as
the
but
this
is
probably
an
error
of
a
day
viii
but
meanwhile
wellington
had
retired
from
their
neighbourhood
on
the
afternoon
of
the
the
orders
had
been
issued
for
the
withdrawing
of
all
the
guns
from
the
before
badajoz
and
by
the
next
morning
many
of
them
were
already
for
elvas
all
through
the
and
convoys
of
ammunition
platforms
fascines
were
being
sent
to
the
rear
and
by
the
night
of
the
day
there
was
nothing
left
in
the
trenches
or
the
camps
save
a
small
daily
store
for
the
troops
who
were
kept
to
blockade
the
fortress
as
long
as
was
prudent
for
it
was
well
that
the
garrison
should
be
straitly
shut
in
and
forced
to
consume
as
much
of
their
provisions
as
possible
wellington
knew
that
they
were
only
rationed
up
to
the
and
there
was
a
bare
chance
that
soult
or
marmont
might
be
delayed
by
some
unforeseen
mishap
nothing
of
the
kind
happened
however
and
on
the
soult
began
to
stir
he
had
been
joined
by
drouet
s
corps
on
that
morning
it
had
accomplished
a
most
circuitous
march
from
valladolid
by
madrid
toledo
the
pass
of
despeñaperros
and
cordova
in
which
it
had
consumed
more
than
a
month
may
all
drouet
s
corps
was
composed
of
battalions
of
regiments
belonging
to
the
or
corps
and
the
provisional
brigade
of
cavalry
which
accompanied
him
consisted
of
and
squadrons
belonging
to
dragoon
regiments
of
the
army
of
the
south
these
were
at
once
treated
as
drafts
and
amalgamated
with
the
depleted
units
which
had
been
so
much
cut
up
at
albuera
the
corps
and
the
other
regiments
present
with
soult
had
men
drafted
into
their
ranks
and
once
more
became
strong
there
remained
over
one
provisional
division
strong
which
consisted
of
battalions
whose
regiments
were
absent
with
victor
before
cadiz
drouet
s
arrival
gave
soult
a
total
force
of
some
men
which
made
him
still
unable
to
face
wellington
with
his
own
unaided
strength
but
he
knew
that
he
could
count
on
marmont
s
approach
with
more
within
a
week
the
regiments
which
received
a
battalion
were
the
and
léger
of
the
corps
and
the
léger
the
cavalry
regiments
which
received
squadrons
were
the
dragoons
the
batts
of
the
and
line
and
the
and
léger
there
were
also
odd
squadrons
of
the
and
dragoons
if
he
pressed
in
upon
badajoz
before
the
junction
took
place
he
would
risk
the
very
real
danger
that
wellington
might
march
against
him
with
every
available
man
and
force
him
to
another
battle
he
therefore
first
sent
cavalry
along
the
highroads
towards
villafranca
and
los
santos
and
only
when
they
reported
that
there
was
no
british
infantry
in
front
of
them
moved
up
his
main
body
to
villafranca
and
almendralejo
june
reconnaissances
were
pushed
towards
the
bridges
of
merida
and
medellin
where
the
army
of
portugal
was
to
be
expected
as
he
kept
very
far
from
wellington
s
front
soult
s
march
was
unmolested
the
british
general
had
concentrated
the
and
divisions

hamilton

on

of

and
could
have
brought
up

ashworth
s
portuguese
to
join
them
in
a
few
hours
but
he
was
not
going
to
take
offensive
action
and
since
soult
kept
well
away
from
him
he
waited
till
he
had
news
that
the
two
french
armies
would
get
in
touch
at

retired

june
but
there
was
one
section
of
the
allied
forces
which
wellington
was
anxious
not
to
withdraw
across
the
guadiana
but
to
send
on
another
quest
and
all
his
future
movements
depended
on
the
march
of
this
corps
the
moment
that
soult
began
to
advance
from
llerena
on
the
and
to
edge
off
in
the
direction
of
merida
and
marmont
he
had
left
the
western
roads
into
andalusia
uncovered
except
a
trifling
detachment
at
guadalcanal
there
was
now
no
force
protecting
seville
on
that
side
from
the
day
that
he
got
the
news
of
the
marshal
s
northerly
march
wellington
began
to
press
general
blake
to
return
at
once
into
his
old
haunts
in
the
condado
de
niebla
passing
round
the
left
rear
of
the
enemy
and
to
begin
to
threaten
seville
there
was
now
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
doing
so
and
it
was
well
known
that
the
andalusian
capital
was
left
to
a
scanty
garrison
largely
composed
of
convalescents
and
untrustworthy
as
long
as
soult
lay
at
llerena
he
could
easily
throw
a
column
to
the
flank
to
succour
seville
but
when
he
had
moved
on
this
was
no
longer
in
his
power
as
early
as
june
wellington
had
written
to
castaños
that
soult
would
ultimately
move
on
merida
and
that
blake
would
then
be
able
to
slip
into
andalusia
either
by
the
route
of
xeres
de
los
caballeros
and
fregenal
or
if
he
preferred
a
safer
though
longer
road
by
that
hugging
the
portuguese
frontier
following
which
he
would
emerge
into
spain
by
mertola
he
could
not
be
stopped
on
either
route
and
his
appearance
before
seville
would
bring
back
soult
in
haste
from
badajoz
and
cure
him
of
any
desire
to
cross
the
guadiana
or
to
besiege
elvas
on
june
wellington
ordered
his
commissaries
to
prepare
rations
at
mertola
for
the
benefit
of
the
spaniards
who
would
probably
be
in
their
usual
state
of
and
wrote
to
blake
to
urge
him
to
march
at
once
the
consented
to
move
but
asked
for
more
food
he
was
told
in
reply
that
he
should
be
fed
from
jerumenha
to
mertola
while
he
was
on
portuguese
soil
but
must
rely
on
his
own
exertions
while
he
was
in
spain
on
the
morning
of
the
blake
crossed
the
guadiana
at
jerumenha
with
loy
s
horse
the
infantry
of
zayas
and
ballasteros
and
two
batteries
and
started
to
march
for
his
destination
he
was
quite
out
of
touch
with
the
enemy
and
so
well
protected
by
the
guadiana
and
the
mountains
that
it
was
certain
that
his
movement
would
be
unobserved
marching
fast
he
reached
mertola
on
june
and
castillejos
across
the
andalusian
frontier
on
the
thus
wellington
was
serenely
confident
when
the
enemy
came
up
against
his
front
that
he
had
thrown
a
bomb
behind
them
whose
explosion
would
cause
no
small
stir
and
infallibly
draw
back
a
large
section
of
the
army
of
andalusia
to
defend
seville
without
these
troops
soult
would
be
in
no
condition
to
attack
him
even
with
marmont
s
aid
the
crisis
between
elvas
and
badajoz
therefore
could
only
last
for
a
few
days
vii
last
two
pages
of
the
volume
viii
pp
see
for
his
confidence
in
the
combination
his
dispatch
to
lord
liverpool
of
june
viii
p
meanwhile
it
had
to
be
faced
and
from
the
to
the
of
june
wellington
might
have
found
himself
engaged
in
a
general
action
on
any
day
of
the
week
soult
and
marmont
had
met
at
merida
on
the
the
day
after
wellington
s
army
had
crossed
the
guadiana
the
elder
marshal
had
overwhelmed
the
younger
with
compliments
it
was
the
first
time
he
said
that
the
army
of
portugal
had
done
anything
for
the
army
of
the
south
with
a
colleague
who
was
unselfish
and
enterprising
he
felt
himself
able
to
undertake
any
task
it
was
settled
that
the
combined
armies
should
march
against
the
albuera
positions
next
morning
in
three
columns
marmont
and
his
six
divisions
would
move
along
the
bank
of
the
guadiana
by
the
road
running
through
lobon
and
talavera
real
the
main
body
of
the
andalusian
forces
would
take
the
route
one
division
detached
by
soult
it
was
the
ten
battalions
of
conroux
the
undistributed
fraction
of
drouet
s
corps
was
to
turn
the
british
line
by
a
flanking
movement
through
almendral
to
valverde
thus
just
men
were
put
in
motion
marmont
having
brought
about
of
all
arms
while
soult
including
drouet
had
about
expecting
an
action
for
wellington
was
known
to
have
been
at
albuera
on
the
and
his
departure
was
unsuspected
the
three
columns
advanced
cautiously
and
ready
to
deploy
but
no
enemy
was
found
and
by
the
evening
of
the
it
was
known
that
the
were
all
behind
the
guadiana
at
dusk
the
head
of
marmont
s
light
cavalry
got
in
touch
with
the
garrison
of
badajoz
and
learnt
that
the
last
of
the
allies
had
disappeared
from
in
front
of
its
walls
on
the
phillipon
was
justified
of
his
long
and
obstinate
defence
on
the
very
day
before
his
would
have
given
out
and
at
the
moment
when
he
was
thinking
seriously
of
blowing
up
his
works
and
making
a
dash
to
get
away
the
expected
succours
had
appeared
il
était
dans
l
ivresse
de
la
joie
et
de
la
reconnaissance
says
marmont
iv
soult
s
letters
to
berthier
give
marmont
a
handsome
testimonial
on
the
marmont
entered
badajoz
in
triumph
amid
the
blare
of
military
music
and
a
few
hours
later
soult
arrived
and
exchanged
felicitations
with
him
and
with
the
trusty
governor
the
two
main
columns
of
each
of
their
armies
converged
on
the
fortress
but
briche
s
light
cavalry
and
the
divisions
of
conroux
and
godinot
went
to
olivenza
to
see
if
by
chance
the
allies
were
holding
that
unlucky
and
town
it
was
found
empty
june
the
small
portuguese
garrison
having
retired
to
elvas
on
the
with
men
in
hand
or
more
if
the
bayonets
of
the
badajoz
garrison
are
counted
and
with
one
bridge
and
many
good
fords
at
their
disposition
for
the
crossing
of
the
guadiana
the
two
marshals
had
the
power
to
thrust
a
general
action
upon
their
adversary
unless
indeed
he
should
retire
far
beyond
the
portuguese
frontier
and
so
give
them
the
chance
of
laying
siege
to
elvas
it
remained
to
be
seen
what
was
his
purpose
and
on
june
a
general
reconnaissance
on
the
further
bank
of
the
guadiana
was
carried
out
on
the
left
godinot
s
division
advanced
from
olivenza
to
a
point
opposite
jerumenha
where
being
very
visible
from
the
further
bank
it
was
furiously
but
ineffectively
cannonaded
by
the
portuguese
garrison
two
dragoon
regiments
under
general
bron
forded
the
river
but
found
no
allied
troops
in
this
direction
on
the
right
montbrun
with
two
cavalry
brigades
of
the
army
of
portugal
passed
the
badajoz
bridge
and
marched
on
campo
mayor
after
driving
in
a
cavalry
screen
belonging
to
de
grey
s
and
madden
s
regiments
he
found
himself
feeling
the
front
of
a
defensive
line
which
he
estimated
at
two
division
of
infantry
and
horse
and
could
get
no
further
forward
he
returned
to
report
that
wellington
was
showing
fight
the
french
reports
show
that
wellington
was
wrong
in
thinking
vol
viii
june
that
the
enemy
got
no
glimpse
of
the
british
infantry
they
apparently
detected
the
and
divisions
in
the
centre
where
in
person
with
fourteen
squadrons
of
dragoons
and
polish
lancers
forded
the
guadiana
almost
in
front
of
elvas
there
was
hard
fighting
ending
in
a
petty
disaster
for
the
allied
outposts
here
the
cavalry
screen
was
formed
on
the
right
by
the
hussars
of
the
king
s
german
legion
on
the
left
by
the
light
dragoons
the
french
column
drove
in
the
pickets
of
the
hussars
who
resisted
from
the
water
s
edge
onward
with
great
obstinacy
presently
the
main
body
of
this
weak
corps
only
two
squadrons
strong
came
up
and
with
more
courage
than
discretion
charged
the
leading
french
regiment
which
they
broke
but
being
outflanked
by
the
enemy
s
reserves
they
were
surrounded
on
three
sides
and
had
to
cut
their
way
out
with
a
loss
of
three
officers
wounded
two
dead
and
twenty
prisoners
the
remains
of
the
hussars
rallied
behind
the
quinta
de
gremezia
where
they
were
presently
joined
by
the
main
body
of
the
light
dragoons
the
enemy
pushed
them
no
further
but
turning
to
the
right
swept
along
wellington
s
outpost
line
in
the
direction
of
badajoz
by
so
doing
they
found
themselves
in
the
rear
of
the
outlying
picket
of
the
formed
by
captain
lutyens
s
troop
this
little
force
had
by
some
mischance
not
paid
much
attention
to
the
disturbance
in
front
of
the
hussars
nor
had
any
orders
been
sent
to
them
by
their
brigadier
long
to
bid
them
be
cautious
as
to
their
flank
warned
at
the
last
moment
by
a
german
sergeant
lutyens
had
just
collected
his
men
and
was
about
to
retire
when
he
saw
a
body
of
cavalry
not
on
his
flank
but
directly
in
his
rear
cutting
him
off
from
elvas
thinking
that
a
bold
dash
was
his
only
chance
he
closed
up
his
men
and
charged
the
front
french
squadron
which
he
broke
through
but
a
second
line
was
behind
and
he
and
his
whole
party
of
sabres
were
ridden
down
and
captured
only
one
wounded
officer
lieutenant
binney
cut
his
way
through
and
brought
the
news
of
the
mishap
the
remainder
under
major
von
busche
was
still
at
cadiz
it
will
be
remembered
that
it
took
a
distinguished
part
in
the
battle
of
barrosa
the
loss
was
killed
officer
and
men
wounded
officer
and
men
unwounded
prisoners
there
are
two
good
accounts
of
this
skirmish
near
quinta
de
gremezia
one
in
a
letter
by
captain
von
stolzenburg
of
the
hussars
in
schwertfeger
s
of
the
ii
the
other
by
george
farmer
a
trooper
of
the
light
dragoons
whose
little
autobiography
was
published
by
gleig
in
under
the
title
of
light
see
vol
pp
farmer
says
that
the
french
dragoons
in
their
rear
were
taken
at
first
for
portuguese
squadrons
coming
up
from
elvas
to
reinforce
the
line
wellington
with
his
usual
clear
perception
attributed
this
little
disaster
to
the
fact
that
the
two
regiments
engaged
had
both
landed
in
the
peninsula
only
a
few
weeks
before
and
were
utterly
unpractised
in
outpost
duty
the
hussars
ought
to
have
retired
skirmishing
it
was
not
their
duty
to
try
to
fight
five
regiments
of
french
the
light
dragoon
pickets
had
clearly
not
kept
touch
with
the
detachments
on
their
flanks
or
they
would
have
heard
of
the
advance
of
the
enemy
in
force
and
would
not
have
been
surrounded
before
they
were
aware
that
the
french
had
got
well
round
their
rear
this
disagreeable
circumstance
he
writes
tends
to
show
the
difference
between
old
and
new
troops
the
old
regiments
of
cavalry
throughout
all
their
service
with
all
their
losses
put
together
have
not
lost
so
many
men
as
the
hussars
and
the
light
dragoons
in
a
few
days
however
we
must
make
the
new
as
good
as
the
old
wellington
also
blamed
general
long
let
him
attend
to
the
directions
he
before
received
from
sir
stapleton
cotton
to
throw
out
only
picquets
of
on
the
caya
and
guadiana
if
he
had
had
his
whole
brigade
instead
of
one
large
picquet
on
the
caya
he
could
not
have
prevented
the
enemy
from
advancing
this
principle
is
well
known
and
understood
in
the
army
and
if
it
had
not
been
acted
upon
invariably
we
should
have
lost
all
our
cavalry
long
ago
in
the
way
in
which
captain
lutyens
lost
the
picquet
of
the
this
morning

by
the
evening
of

the
two
french
marshals
as
the
result
of
their
reconnaissances
were
fully
aware
that
wellington
lay
in
force
from
campo
mayor
to
elvas
and
had
no
intention
of
retiring
but
they
had
not
been
able
to
make
out
the
details
of
his
position
which
lay
across
an
undulating
country
wooded
in
many
parts
and
not
to
be
embraced
in
a
single
view
from
any
commanding
spot
as
a
matter
of
fact
their
adversary
had
now
got
up
all
his
troops
the
last
division
from
the
beira
came
into
touch
with
the
main
body
on
the
morning
of
the
elaborate
orders
issued
for
the
conduct
of
the
army

french
should
advance

what
were
the
intentions
of
wellington
they
exist
in
the
d
urban
papers
though
not
printed
in

fall
into
three

ouguella
was
a
little
town
with
mediaeval
fortifications

of

for
some
hours
it
was
garrisoned
by
two
companies
of
portuguese

there
is
no
practicable
route
to

save
by

thus
the
allied
army
though
still
appreciably
inferior
in

an
open
plain
which
though
interspersed
with
occasional
groves
was
sufficiently
commanded

of
the
position
being
good
and
the
caya
fordable
in
many
places
wellington
thought
that
he
was
certain
of
being
able
to
transfer
troops
with
swiftness
and
security
to
any
part
of
the
line
that
might
be
threatened
the
only
way
in
which
the
enemy
could
approach
him
unseen
would
be
by
moving
at
night
and
even
so
there
would
be
ample
warning
since
the
cavalry
pickets
were
out
far
in
front
of
the
line
and
would
give
notice
betimes
moreover
a
of
some
nine
miles
out
from
badajoz
over
unknown
ground
towards
an
undiscovered
position
would
have
little
temptation
for
the
enemy
the
danger
of
blundering
into
a
trap
in
the
dark
would
be
too
great
this
description
of
the
allied
position
differs
it
may
be
noted
from
napier
s
iii
where
it
is
said
that
the
division
was
retained
at
portalegre
as
a
general
reserve
i
think
that
this
is
an
error
for
the
division
perhaps
a
printer
s
error
perpetuated
through
many
editions
like
some
others
in
his
great
work
for
the
journals
of
the
guards
brigade
of
the
division
stothert
stepney
show
that
it
left
portalegre
on

was
at
santa
olalla
near
elvas
on
the
oddly
enough
lord
londonderry
makes
the
same
mistake
ii
saying
that
spencer
was
kept
back
at
portalegre
with
his
whole
corps
the

gomm

the
lowest
possible

wellington
to
lord
liverpool

says
that
he
has
effective
and
of

adding
as
usual
more
for
officers
sergeants
and

we
get
total
for
infantry
now
being
certainly
british
as
by

above
there
must
be
portuguese
of
all
ranks
which
tallies
with
the
figure
above
the
artillery
details
are
from
the
ed
leslie
d
urban
under
july
when
a
regiment
or
two
the
had
joined
from
lisbon
says
that
the
allied
total
of
and
was
infantry
cavalry
artillery
in
all
or
adding
officers
and
sergeants
about
this
seems
a
high
estimate
for
the
infantry
but
low
for
the
cavalry
and
artillery
all
these
details
are
set
out
in
full
in
the
orders
copied
in
d
urban
s
diary
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
french
marshals
were
not
proposing
to
attack
they
had
learnt
that
spencer
s
divisions
were
up
so
that
the
whole
of
the
army
was
in
front
of
them
and
they
shrank
from
committing
themselves
to
a
general
action
marmont
wrote
to
berthier
on
june
soult
on
june
and
in
neither
of
their
dispatches
is
there
the
least
intention
displayed
of
making
any
further
offensive
move
both
state
that
they
intended
to
attack
the
albuera
position
on
the
if
wellington
had
stayed
in
it
the
enemy
says
marmont
retired
in
haste
repassed
the
guadiana
and
returned
into
portugal
without
leaving
us
any
chance
of
tackling
him
it
is
tiresome
that
he
would
not
make
trial
of
his
fortune
for
a
decisive
victory
would
infallibly
have
marked
our
arrival
in
this
soult
in
very
similar
terms
writes
the
duke
of
ragusa
and
i
had
resolved
to
give
battle
but
lord
wellington
prudently
retreated
before
we
could
come
up
with
him
yet
he
had
men
of
whom
were
english
including
general
spencer
s
divisions
just
drawn
in
from
the
north
portuguese
and
spaniards
there
were
cavalry
among
them
it
is
vexatious
that
no
general
action
could
take
place
our
success
would
not
be
doubtful
but
we
may
hope
that
another
occasion
may
present
itself
especially
if
the
army
of
portugal
continues
to
keep
in
touch
with
the
army
of
the
south
and
communicates
with
it
as
it
is
now
doing
of
that
i
have
no
doubt
from
the
alacrity
with
which
the
duke
of
ragusa
marched
to
join
in
the
relief
of
badajoz
with
all
his
disposable
soult
then
proceeds
to
state
with
great
gravity
that
albuera
was
a
signal
victory
and
the
sole
cause
of
the
preservation
of
badajoz
ignoring
the
fact
that
he
retreated
sixty
miles
after
it
and
could
not
move
again
till
he
had
been
joined
by
drouet
and
marmont
these
two
noteworthy
dispatches
are
accessible
in
the
appendix
to
vol
i
of
belmas
to
those
who
have
not
time
to
visit
the
paris
archives
if
soult
wanted
another
signal
victory
of
the
type
of
albuera
he
had
only
to
march
nine
miles
towards
campo
mayor
on
the
day
after
he
wrote
this
dispatch
to
berthier
the
temptation
was
surely
great
since
the
defeat
of
wellington
s
army
would
have
shaken
to
its
foundations
the
whole
defence
of
the
peninsula
to
assemble
the
force
now
lying
by
badajoz
andalusia
and
leon
had
been
stripped
of
all
disposable
troops
and
left
exposed
to
the
raids
of
the
spanish
armies
of
galicia
and
murcia
and
to
the
omnipresent
guerrilleros
who
had
already
cut
communications
in
every
direction
if
wellington
could
be
beaten
the
concentration
was
justified
if
he
were
left
unmolested
nothing
had
been
gained
save
the
reprovisioning
of
badajoz
and
the
game
might
go
on
for
ever
battle
was
now
offered
to
the
marshals
if
they
chose
to
accept
it
the
reconnaissance
of
june
proved
that
the
allies
had
taken
up
a
position
and
were
standing
on
it
illustration
estremadura
but
neither
soult
nor
marmont
would
advance
the
cause
of
their
reluctance
to
engage
was
undoubtedly
a
moral
one
as
napier
very
truly
remarks
in
a
typical
sentence
marmont
s
army
was
conscious
of
its
recent
defeats
at
bussaco
at
sabugal
at
fuentes
de
oñoro
the
horrid
field
of
albuera
was
fresh
the
fierce
blood
there
spilt
still
reeked
in
the
nostrils
of
soult
s
the
generals
no
less
than
the
rank
and
file
felt
a
qualm
at
the
idea
of
attacking
wellington
in
a
position
which
he
had
taken
up
with
deliberation
and
where
he
showed
himself
serenely
expectant
of
their
attack
they
were
aware
that
an
attempt
to
dislodge
him
would
be
rendered
very
tiresome
by
the
fact
that
elvas
and
campo
mayor
protected
his
line
they
his
forces
by
the
number
of
blake
s
army
which
till
the
june
they
wrongly
supposed
to
be
still
with
him
so
contenting
themselves
with
dictating
pompous
dispatches
concerning
the
importance
of
the
relief
of
badajoz
which
was
indeed
a
notable
advantage
they
went
each
upon
his
separate
way
instead
of
attempting
to
inflict
a
defeat
on
wellington
the
marshals
did
no
more
than
patch
up
a
scheme
by
which
they
thought
he
might
be
contained
and
held
in
check
for
the
present
in
short
the
offensive
spirit
was
gone
the
french
armies
in
spain
found
themselves
thrown
upon
the
defensive
and
so
things
were
to
remain
for
the
rest
of
the
peninsular
war
the
offensive
though
it
was
hardly
realized
as
yet
had
passed
to
wellington
vol
iii
napier
iii
suggests
that
since
the
stores
of
elvas
had
run
low
and
its
ammunition
reserve
in
especial
had
been
much
depleted
by
the
expenditure
of
shot
and
shell
before
badajoz
the
place
was
in
such
a
dangerous
condition
that
soult
had
he
known
this
state
of
affairs
might
have
passed
the
guadiana
by
the
fords
and
by
means
of
his
pontoons
from
badajoz
might
have
overpowered
the
allies
right
invested
elvas
and
covered
his
army
by
lines
unless
indeed
the
english
general
anticipating
the
attempt
defeated
him
between
the
caya
and
elvas
this
might
not
have
been
easy
in
an
open
country
which
offered
every
advantage
to
the
overwhelming
cavalry
and
artillery
of
the
with
all
humility
i
must
express
my
doubts
as
to
the
wisdom
or
practicability
of
this
course
an
army
of
men
with
another
of
in
its
front
can
not
surely
venture
to
form
the
siege
of
a
fortress
unless
it
has
previously
beaten
the
covering
army
in
a
general
action
napier
suggests
that
soult
should
push
back
wellington
s
right
and
surround
elvas
but
the
attempt
have
brought
on
a
general
action
close
under
the
walls
of
elvas
in
which
the
allies
would
have
had
every
advantage
of
position
meanwhile
the
allies
could
not
tell
what
might
be
the
intentions
of
the
enemy
seeing
the
enormous
advantage
that
a
victory
would
bring
the
french
and
remembering
the
way
in
which
they
had
stripped
all
spain
of
troops
in
order
to
produce
the
army
which
now
lay
opposite
him
wellington
thought
that
he
was
to
be
attacked
and
continued
for
some
days
to
perfect
his
preparations
the
period
of
intent
waiting
was
from
the
to
the
of
june
during
which
nothing
was
to
be
made
out
concerning
the
main
purpose
of
the
french
petty
cavalry
reconnaissances
in
the
direction
of
the
albuquerque
and
montijo
roads
much
moving
about
of
small
columns
between
olivenza
and
badajoz
were
observed
but
no
certain
deductions
could
be
drawn
from
them
no
judging
what
he
means
yet
meanwhile
everything
is
ready
for
him
wrote
d
urban
beresford
s
chief
of
the
staff
in
his
diary
on
june
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
small
movements
hitherto
observed
were
merely
matters
of
foraging
and
exploration
and
had
no
occult
meaning
on
the
however
there
was
something
definite
to
be
learnt
on
the
morning
of
that
day
godinot
s
division
blew
up
the
walls
of
olivenza
and
marched
to
valverde
this
disappearance
of
the
french
left
wing
have
meant
that
all
the
columns
were
being
drawn
in
for
an
attack
in
the
centre
but
it
might
also
mean
that
soult
was
about
to
send
back
troops
to
seville
that
the
latter
was
the
true
interpretation
was
shown
on
the
when
godinot
definitely
marched
not
towards
badajoz
but
southward
along
the
leading
to
andalusia
by
los
santos
and
monasterio
it
was
certain
that
if
soult
was
sending
away
men
from
the
front
he
could
not
be
intending
to
attack
since
every
man
would
be
required
if
a
dash
at
the
lines
was
in
contemplation
when
wellington
had
news
from
the
peasantry
of
godinot
s
southward
march
on
the
june
he
could
see
that
the
die
had
been
cast
and
that
he
need
no
longer
look
for
an
attack
upon
his
lines
he
was
soon
afterwards
informed
that
two
divisions
were
gone
southward
not
merely
one
but
for
some
time
he
could
get
no
certitude
of
the
departure
of
the
second
division
though
it
was
perfectly
true
that
this
unit
conroux
s
ten
battalions
of
drouet
s
old
corps
had
departed
almost
immediately
after
godinot
what
had
happened
was
that
on
june
the
fourth
day
after
the
entry
of
the
two
marshals
into
badajoz
soult
had
informed
marmont
that
he
had
such
bad
news
from
andalusia
that
he
must
return
at
once
to
seville
with
some
of
his
troops
it
was
not
so
much
blake
s
diversion
which
was
working
the
french
had
learnt
of
his
start
on
the
but
did
not
know
that
he
had
reached
the
condado
de
niebla
as
the
tidings
of
the
spread
of
the
insurrection
in
the
ronda
mountains
and
of
threatening
movements
by
freire
s
army
of
murcia
against
the
corps
the
force
in
eastern
andalusia
had
lent
so
much
to
soult
s
field
army
and
so
much
more
to
garrison
the
province
of
cordova
that
it
was
much
under
strength
there
were
only
men
or
less
left
in
the
kingdom
of
granada
and
the
murcian
army
was
strong
marmont
refused
to
take
soult
s
fears
seriously
being
as
he
himself
tells
us
convinced
by
this
time
that
his
colleague
was
wanting
to
throw
all
the
responsibility
of
keeping
badajoz
safe
and
containing
wellington
on
the
army
of
portugal
he
replied
that
unless
soult
promised
to
leave
him
the
whole
of
the
corps
and
all
s
cavalry
he
should
order
his
troops
to
march
for
truxillo
and
almaraz
and
throw
the
charge
of
badajoz
on
the
army
of
the
south
which
might
keep
it
if
it
could
soult
s
dispatch
of
june
says
that
he
has
just
heard
that
blake
has
gone
off
southward
four
battalions
two
cavalry
regiments
and
a
battery
had
been
lent
for
the
field
army
of
the
four
regiments
garrisoning
that
region
three
léger
had
joined
the
albuera
army
sebastiani
had
to
lend
several
battalions
to
take
their
place
see
iv
soult
was
forced
to
assent
to
this
demand
and
took
away
only
godinot
s
and
conroux
s
provisional
divisions
and
three
regiments
of
cavalry
the
corps
now
placed
under
drouet
and
six
dragoon
regiments
were
left
behind
on
the
guadiana
to
enable
marmont
to
maintain
a
safe
defensive
against
wellington
they
made
up
some
men
which
with
the
of
the
army
of
portugal
provided
a
force
quite
insufficient
to
attack
the
allies
yet
large
enough
to
prevent
a
siege
of
badajoz
for
no
general
least
of
all
the
cautious
commander
of
the
army
would
undertake
to
besiege
a
fortress
of
the
first
class
situated
on
two
sides
of
a
broad
river
with
men
when
a
covering
force
of
men
was
supporting
it
in
the
near
vicinity
two
infantry
divisions
and
briche
s
light
cavalry
men
since
the
drafts
had
come
under
drouet
meanwhile
for
a
fortnight
after
soult
had
departed
from
badajoz
for
seville
on
june
marmont
and
drouet
on
one
side
of
the
guadiana
and
wellington
on
the
other
stood
observing
each
other
and
waiting
each
for
some
move
on
the
part
of
his
adversary
the
british
general
knew
that
the
french
in
his
front
were
no
longer
strong
enough
to
attack
him
on
his
positions
around
the
caya
but
he
must
keep
his
army
concentrated
since
if
he
made
detachments
in
any
direction
marmont
might
yet
make
a
dash
at
elvas
and
that
place
though
it
had
been
much
improved
of
late
during
the
weeks
when
an
attack
on
it
seemed
probable
still
left
something
to
be
desired
especially
in
the
quality
of
the
guns
on
its
walls
our
old
acquaintances
of
the
siege
of
badajoz
and
their
brethren
as
long
as
marmont
and
drouet
remained
massed
near
badajoz
the
allied
army
could
not
disperse
when
a
siege
seemed
probable
general
leite
demolished
a
number
of
houses
and
trees
too
close
to
the
walls
improved
the
works
by
clearing
the
ditch
and
strengthening
parapets
and
did
his
best
to
draw
in
all
available
provisions
this
last
was
hard
when
so
large
a
friendly
army
was
close
at
hand
eating
up
the
on
the
other
hand
the
french
generals
were
compelled
to
keep
together
for
a
time
in
order
to
superintend
the
victualling
of
badajoz
whose
magazines
were
absolutely
empty
at
the
moment
of
its
relief
if
they
had
drawn
back
into
cantonments
and
scattered
their
men
wellington
might
have
thrown
a
light
corps
and
cavalry
across
the
guadiana
and
have
established
once
more
a
blockade
of
the
fortress
accordingly
from
the
of
june
to
the
of
july
the
army
of
portugal
and
the
corps
remained
concentrated
in
the
quadrilateral
sweeping
the
for
provisions
each
regiment
was
ordered
to
deposit
in
the
magazines
of
badajoz
a
prescribed
number
of
of
wheat
or
maize
making
in
all
six
months
rations
for
a
garrison
of
men
north
of
the
guadiana
the
french
cavalry
ranged
about
the
region
around
montijo
and
torre
del
fresno
where
they
were
in
constant
touch
with
wellington
s
exploring
squadrons
sent
out
from
campo
mayor
and
ouguella
but
no
serious
collisions
occurred
at
last
on
july
it
was
reported
that
badajoz
was
fully
provisioned
and
marmont
informed
drouet
that
he
was
about
to
disperse
his
army
in
cantonments
reaching
as
far
as
the
tagus
since
northern
estremadura
was
wholly
exhausted
he
would
keep
a
division
at
truxillo
between
merida
and
the
tagus
and
the
rest
of
his
army
could
be
brought
back
at
the
shortest
notice
if
the
should
make
a
forward
move
drouet
after
changing
the
garrison
of
badajoz
for
new
battalions
of
the
same
regiments
which
had
endured
the
two
sieges
of
may
and
june
and
confiding
its
charge
once
more
to
the
trusty
phillipon
drew
back
the
corps
to
zafra
los
santos
and
merida
leaving
briche
s
light
cavalry
at
santa
marta
to
keep
the
communication
with
badajoz
open
the
marshal
and
the
general
calculated
that
if
wellington
should
once
more
come
forward
they
could
join
again
at
merida
in
six
or
seven
days
to
contain
him
he
could
do
nothing
against
badajoz
in
the
short
time
that
would
elapse
before
their
concentration
but
wellington
had
for
the
present
no
further
designs
against
the
fortress
which
had
cost
him
so
much
useless
labour
the
moment
that
marmont
s
departure
was
announced
to
him
he
too
dispersed
his
army
into
cantonments
the
banks
of
the
caya
and
guadiana
were
notorious
for
their
fever
and
the
troops
were
already
beginning
to
suffer
from
it
on
the
of
july
orders
were
issued
for
the
and
divisions
to
march
for
castello
branco
the
for
niza
the
and
for
portalegre
the
for
estremos
and
then
for
pedrogão
the
light
division
for
castello
de
vide
and
montalvão
only
the
and
hamilton
s
portuguese
remained
in
the
neighbourhood
of
elvas
the
former
at
villa
viçosa
the
latter
at
fronteira
and
souzel
a
little
further
to
the
hill
retained
charge
of
these
two
divisions
which
formed
the
army
of
the
south
for
the
next
twelve
months
his
allowance
of
cavalry
consisted
of
barbaçena
s
and
otway
s
portuguese
brigades
and
long
s
and
de
grey
s
british
brigades
which
are
for
the
future
spoken
of
as
the
second
cavalry
division
of
the
allied
army
its
command
was
given
not
to
lumley
who
had
used
the
troops
so
effectively
during
the
late
campaign
for
he
had
just
gone
on
sick
leave
to
england
it
went
to
sir
william
erskine
of
whom
wellington
could
find
no
more
to
say
when
proposing
him
to
beresford
for
this
post
than
that
he
would
at
any
rate
do
better
than
long
and
that
if
very
blind
which
is
against
him
at
the
head
of
cavalry
he
was
at
any
rate
very
cautious
the
fact
was
that
erskine
had
given
grave
dissatisfaction
at
sabugal
and
elsewhere
and
that
the
wished
to
shunt
him
on
to
some
new
line
where
he
would
have
less
responsibility
yet
the
experiment
of
trusting
him
with
two
cavalry
brigades
was
a
risky
one
elaborate
marching
arrangements
and
timing
for
all
these
destinations
are
found
in
d
urban
s
diary
under
july
vii
there
was
more
reorganization
carried
out
in
the
allied
army
during
the
months
of
june
july
and
august
than
at
any
other
period
of
wellington
s
command
owing
to
the
arrival
of
more
cavalry
regiments
there
were
by
september
six
cavalry
brigades
in
existence
instead
of
three
and
they
contained
thirteen
regiments
instead
of
the
original
seven
which
had
served
in
and
the
early
months
of
wellington
s
mounted
strength
had
been
almost
doubled
though
most
of
the
corps
arrived
too
late
to
be
available
when
the
french
were
showing
such
a
preponderant
cavalry
force
on
the
caya
in
june
but
in
the
next
campaign
wellington
was
to
be
for
the
first
time
since
his
arrival
in
the
peninsula
possessed
of
an
adequate
proportion

into

the
and
divisions
were
comparatively
little
altered
getting
between
them
all
only
two
more
battalions
on

after
replacing
certain
old
ones
by
newly
arrived
units
but
the

hitherto
containing
only

provided
with

by
taking

which
had
fought
so
well
at

to
go

the

gave

sent

and
the
was
transferred
to

came
out
to
portugal
and
joined
the

got
one
new
battalion
in
july
in
the
division
the
and
were
amalgamated
but
the
number
of
battalions
was
kept
as
before
by
the
transference
of
the
from
the
division
the
division
got
one
new
unit
the
the
division
took
over
alten
s
light
battalions
and
received
the
but
sent
home
the
after
it
had
been
only
seven
months
in
the
peninsula
wellington
refused
to
keep
this
regiment
which
on
its
return
to
england
went
through
a
series
of
testifying
to
grave
internal
faults
the
net
result
of
all
this
change
was
that
when
wellington
once
more
divided
his
army
into
a
northern
and
a
southern
force
in
august
the
latter
now
under
hill
amounted
to
about
bayonets
and
nearly
sabres
this
detachment
having
four
cavalry
brigades
five
british
and
four
portuguese
regiments
was
able
to
contain
its
normal
adversary
in
estremadura
drouet
s
corps
which
had
about
the
same
number
of
cavalry
and
two
or
three
thousand
more
infantry
hill
s
regular
task
was
to
cover
elvas
and
to
keep
drouet
in
check
without
committing
himself
to
any
large
offensive
operations
for
which
his
force
was
manifestly
inadequate
but
the
northern
corps
or
main
army
was
now
far
stronger
than
it
had
ever
been
before
amounting
to
some
men
including
cavalry
it
now
became
for
the
first
time
decidedly
superior
in
numbers
to
its
special
opponent
the
french
army
of
portugal
which
even
after
receiving
its
drafts
and
convalescents
in
the
autumn
did
not
amount
to
quite
men
and
was
very
weak
in
cavalry
of
which
it
did
not
possess
more
than
clearly
then
for
the
future
marmont
could
not
possibly
take
the
offensive
against
wellington
with
his
own
forces
and
would
have
to
depend
for
help
on
the
army
of
the
north
if
matters
came
to
a
crisis
he
would
be
lucky
if
he
were
able
to
contain
the
and
certainly
could
not
think
of
doing
more
unless
he
were
able
to
get
prompt
reinforcements
from
bessières
or
after
that
marshal
s
departure
from
his
successor
dorsenne
indeed
the
army
of
portugal
was
so
clearly
inadequate
to
discharge
the
function
of
protecting
the
whole
spanish
frontier
from
the
guadiana
to
the
douro
that
the
emperor
though
in
october
he
once
more
proposed
to
marmont
an
invasion
of
portugal
was
ultimately
forced
to
make
over
to
it
men
from
the
army
of
the
north
the
divisions
of
souham
and
bonnet
but
of
this
more
in
its
own
place
it
must
suffice
here
to
say
that
the
net
results
of
the
spring
and
summer
campaigns
of
was
to
leave
the
french
decidedly
on
the
defensive
all
along
the
portuguese
border
and
to
transfer
to
wellington
the
opportunity
of
trying
the
offensive
it
was
to
be
five
months
however
before
he
succeeded
in
taking
it
up
his
autumn
operations
of
were
tentative
and
led
to
no
definite
results
from
july
to
december
there
was
much
manœuvring
but
little
change
came
of
it
this
was
done
by
an
imperial
decree
issued
on
december
through
berthier
section
xxvii
chapter
iii
events
in
the
north
of
spain
during
the
concentration
on
the
caya
dorsenne
and
the
galicians
it
is
often
forgotten
by
english
writers
that
while
the
armies
of
wellington
soult
and
marmont
faced
each
other
near
badajoz
in
only
in
the
end
to
depart
in
different
directions
without
a
battle
there
was
a
second
and
minor
crisis
going
on
in
the
north
which
had
important
consequences
wellington
had
designedly
brought
it
about
because
without
it
the
french
would
have
had
much
larger
forces
disposable
for
action
against
portugal
and
might
have
given
much
trouble
by
demonstrating
against
the
beira
frontier
when
marmont
and
sir
brent
spencer
moving
in
parallel
columns
transferred
themselves
in
ten
days
from
the
banks
of
the
agueda
and
the
tormes
to
those
of
the
guadiana
the
angle
of
portugal
was
almost
stripped
of
troops
there
remained
only
the
militia
divisions
of
silveira
north
of
the
douro
in
the
province
of
and
of
wilson
and
trant
south
of
the
douro
in
front
of
guarda
and
celorico
the
whole
did
not
amount
to
men
of
inferior
quality
fortunately
the
french
army
of
portugal
had
gone
southward
marmont
had
left
nothing
behind
him
save
the
garrison
of
ciudad
rodrigo
and
a
great
dépôt
of
convalescents
dismounted
dragoons
and
other
odds
and
ends
at
salamanca
from
them
there
was
nothing
to
be
feared
silveira
had
only
one
infantry
regiment
of
regulars
no
and
two
squadrons
of
regular
dragoons
as
also
two
batteries
of
old
artillery
wilson
had
one
squadron
of
regular
dragoons
but
behind
salamanca
lay
bessières
s
army
of
the
north
the
duke
of
istria
had
very
unwillingly
pledged
himself
to
marmont
to
take
over
the
supervision
of
the
frontiers
of
leon
when
the
army
of
portugal
marched
for
badajoz
he
had
declared
when
asked
for
help
in
may
that
he
had
not
a
man
to
spare
after
providing
for
the
duty
already
incumbent
on
him
of
holding
down
all
old
castile
asturias
and
santander
as
the
emperor
kept
assuring
him
by
angry
dispatches
from
paris
this
was
an
exaggeration
it
was
in
his
power
to
collect
a
small
field
army
of
or
men
without
giving
up
any
essential
point
in
his
extensive
sphere
of
operations
and
in
july
he
did
so
much
against
his
inclination
and
suffered
no
harm
by
so
doing
if
such
a
force
had
been
set
to
threaten
northern
portugal
during
the
concentration
on
the
caya
wellington
would
have
felt
most
uncomfortable
but
occupation
was
found
for
bessières
from
another
quarter
and
this
was
part
of
the
british
commander
s
general
scheme
for
the
defence
of
the
peninsula
with
the
consent
of
general
castaños
since
he
could
only
suggest
and
not
command
any
operations
to
be
undertaken
by
spanish
troops
wellington
had
provided
for
an
attack
on
the
flank
of
bessières
by
a
force
of
which
we
have
heard
nothing
for
many
months
the
army
of
galicia
if
threatened
on
the
esla
and
the
orbigo
bessières
would
be
able
to
spare
no
attention
for
the
agueda
see
especially
berthier
to
bessières
of
may
from
rambouillet
see
especially
wellington
to
general
walker
british
attaché
with
the
army
of
galicia
vii
where
the
siege
of
astorga
and
the
troubling
of
bonnet
in
asturias
are
the
operations
recommended
castaños
was
still
titular
in
galicia
as
well
as
in
estremadura
at
this
time
the
army
of
the
north
was
not
so
strong
in
numbers
as
it
became
a
few
weeks
later
when
napoleon
s
divisions
of
reserve
began
to
cross
the
pyrenees
in
june
it
consisted
of
only
four
infantry
divisions
those
of
generals
bonnet
serras
roguet
and
dumoustier
and
of
two
brigades
of
cavalry
under
wathier
and
lepic
bonnet
s
division
had
been
holding
the
central
region
of
the
asturias
and
the
city
of
oviedo
since
it
had
conquered
them
in
january
in
addition
it
had
occupied
a
string
of
ports
from
gijon
to
santander
in
order
to
keep
off
the
english
cruisers
from
their
communication
with
the
guerrilleros
of
the
cantabrian
hills
bonnet
had
a
strong
force
four
full
regiments
of
infantry
making
men
yet
could
never
complete
the
conquest
of
the
asturias
wherever
he
struck
with
a
strong
force
he
could
penetrate
but
any
move
far
from
his
base
at
oviedo
brought
down
the
enemy
upon
some
of
his
isolated
posts
which
he
had
then
to
rescue
by
a
swift
return
his
enemies
were
on
the
left
hand
the
relics
of
the
old
spanish
army
of
asturias
now
under
general
losada
who
hung
about
the
mountains
on
the
galician
frontier
on
the
right
the
great
partisan
chiefs
porlier
and
longa
whose
beat
was
in
the
sierras
above
santander
on
the
left
of
bonnet
lay
bessières
s
second
division
that
of
serras
which
had
originally
been
assigned
to
the
army
of
portugal
in
but
had
remained
behind
to
watch
the
galician
spaniards
its
head
quarters
were
at
benavente
it
held
astorga
as
an
advanced
post
and
leon
as
a
from
the
latter
place
it
communicated
with
bonnet
through
the
pass
of
pajares
this
was
an
enormous
front
for
a
division
of
men
to
occupy
and
that
too
one
not
composed
of
picked
troops
but
of
miscellaneous
units
for
serras
had
two
italian
regiments
léger
line
and
two
polish
and
two
swiss
battalions
so
that
much
the
larger
half
of
his
men
were
auxiliary
troops

not
native
french
the
were
a
new
tuscan
regiment
raised
in
which
had
been
practically
destroyed
in
catalonia
and
sent
home
to
recruit
the
léger
was
genoese
on
the
other
hand
there
was
nothing
left
to
be
desired
in
the
two
divisions
of
roguet
and
dumoustier
which
held
the
central
position
in
bessières
s
cantonments
they
were
all

of
the
young

eleven
regiments

attached
to
them
were
three
composite
regiments
of

and
a
proportion
of

whole
made
up
of
men
of
the
best
quality

was
cantoned
within
the
provinces
of
valladolid
and
palencia
roguet
s
within

of

south
they
had
no
enemies
save
the
guerrilleros
of

tiresome
and
elusive
but
not
formidable
foes
on
the
north
in
the
liebana
and
the
cantabrian
hills
longa
and
porlier
were
much
more
troublesome
and
dangerous
their
bands
were
well
armed
and
organized
on
the
principles
of
a
regular
army
yet
had
not
lost
the
power
of
rapid
movement
which
was
the
true
strength
of
the
system
the
sierras
in
which
they
operated
were
including
their
some
fifty
miles
broad
a
chaos
of
passes
and
ravines
countless
expeditions
against
them
had
led
to
no
final
result
like
the
holy
men
of
old
when
persecuted
in
one
region
they
merely
fled
to
another
if
the
flying
columns
and
petty
garrisons
were
withdrawn
for
a
moment
they
would
be
at
the
gates
of
burgos
or
santander
within
two
days
and
the
and
the
main
arteries
of
communication
with
france
would
be
cut
there
was
soon
to
be
a
fifth
division
in
bessières
s
army
but
it
had
not
yet
arrived
from
france
that
of
souham
which
formed
along
with
the
divisions
of
caffarelli
and
reille
the
great
reinforcement
poured
by
napoleon
into

during
the
late
summer

it
was
only
beginning
to
march
up
from
marseilles
turin
and
spezia
the
distant
garrisons
from
which
it
was
to
be
drawn
before
it
arrived
in
spain
bessières
had
ceased
to
command
the
army
of
the
north
and
dorsenne
had
taken
his
place
hence
though
wellington
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
the
months
of
june
and
july
were
exceptionally
favourable
for
a
move
against
the
french
flank
in
this
direction
for
details
of
its
movements
see
napoleon
s
june
in
addition
to
his
four
infantry
divisions
bessières
possessed
wathier
s
brigade
of
light
cavalry
and
lepic
s
brigade
of
guard
cavalry
together
with
some
unbrigaded
units
such
as
the
of
the
line
the
fixed
garrison
of
santander
the
battalion
of
neuchâtel
which
he
had
moved
forward
to
salamanca
a
number
of
squadrons
of
and
a
quantity
of
drafts
for
the
armies
of
portugal
and
the
centre
which
had
been
stopped
on
their
way
south
in
a
surreptitious
fashion
by
various
who
wanted
to
strengthen
their
depleted
detachments
in
the
autumn
marmont
succeeded
in
extracting
no
less
than
of
his
own
men
from
the
territories
of
the
army
of
the
north
not
without
much
friction
with
the
local
officers
who
wished
to
detain
them
this
was
a
newly
created
regiment
formed
out
of
a
number
of
provisional
battalions
which
had
been
doing
garrison
duty
in
biscay
for
the
last
year
bessières
grossly
underrated
his
own
force
in
a
letter
to
berthier
of
june
in
which
he
stated
the
whole
at
only
men
the
whole
force
between
the
borders
of
navarre
and
those
of
portugal
was
in
june
and
july
not
less
than
men
even
before
the
three
divisions
of
souham
reille
and
caffarelli
came
up
from
france
on
the
other
hand
they
had
an
enormous
area
to
keep
down
not
less
than
a
fifth
of
the
whole
surface
of
spain
and
if
their
regular
enemies
the
armies
of
galicia
and
asturias
were
weak
they
had
among
the
irregulars
opposed
to
them
the
boldest
and
the
most
obstinate
of
all
the
guerrillero
chiefs
any
serious
move
against
a
section
of
bessières
s
long
line
would
cause
disturbance
over
the
whole
of
his
viceroyalty
since
to
collect
a
serious
force
he
would
have
to
cut
down
the
garrisons
of
many
localities
below
it
was
on
this
fact
that
wellington
relied
when
he
obtained
castaños
s
leave
to
set
the
spanish
army
of
galicia
in
motion
it
was
fortunately
led
at
this
moment
by
an
active
and
enterprising
chief
santocildes
the
hero
of
the
defence
of
astorga
in
who
lent
himself
eagerly
to
the
plan
though
his
army
was
not
in
good
order
the
cadres
left
behind
in
the
north
when
del
parque
moved
into
estremadura
in
the
winter
of
were
the
worst
and
weakest
of
the
old
army
of
galicia
and
though
they
had
been
filled
up
with
local
recruits
till
the
whole
force
had
a
nominal
strength
of
men
the
organization
was
bad
and
the
want
of
and
capable
regimental
officers
very
noticeable
the
junta
of
galicia
had
spent
more
energy
in
on
quarrels
with
the
mahy
than
on
the
equipment
of
its
army
its
weakest
point
was
that
it
possessed
only
regular
cavalry
a
defect
that
must
be
fatal
if
it
left
the
mountains
to
descend
into
the
plains
of
leon
it
was
for
this
reason
that
wellington
advised
santocildes
to
form
the
siege
of
astorga
to
harass
bonnet
in
the
asturias
but
not
to
quit
the
skirts
of
the
friendly
sierras
on
taking
over
charge
of
the
whole
kingdom
of
leon
from
marmont
bessières
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
must
draw
in
troops
towards
the
south
lest
he
should
be
caught
in
a
position
in
which
he
had
no
disposable
central
mass
towards
the
douro
consequently
on
the
of
june
he
sent
orders
to
bonnet
to
evacuate
the
asturias
and
fall
back
by
the
pass
of
pajares
to
leon
in
order
to
place
himself
in
closer
touch
with
serras
on
the
therefore
bonnet
left
oviedo
and
came
over
the
mountains
with
three
of
his
regiments
while
the
fourth
went
eastward
parallel
to
the
coast
in
the
direction
of
santander
picking
up
in
its
retreat
all
the
small
garrisons
which
had
been
left
to
dominate
the
asturian
ports
and
to
prevent
communication
between
longa
and
porlier
and
the
english
cruisers
by
the

at
leon
with
men
he
was
just
in
time
to
support
the
scattered
front
line
formed
by
serras
s
division
against
the
attack
which
wellington
had
planned
for
santocildes
and
the
army
of
galicia
had
advanced
against
astorga
quite
without
his
knowledge
two
days
before
he
marched
south
from
oviedo

the

the

so
outnumbered

retreat
towards

before

so
far
first
serras
from

prudence
refused

abandoned

the

and
withdrew
into
the
mountains
of
astorga
where
he
took
post
at
torienzo
the

did
not
pursue
and
only
a
party
of
light
cavalry
entered
astorga
which
it
abandoned

day
for
bessières
had
received
intelligence
that
his
head
quarters
at
valladolid
which
was
almost
ungarrisoned
in
the
absence
of
dumoustier
s
division
had
been
attacked
by
the
of
the
southern
sierras
july
at
the
same
time
general
dorsenne
reported
from
burgos
that
mina
had
crossed
into
his
government
deserting
his
more
usual
haunts
in
navarre
and
had
united
with
longa
and
porlier
they
had
a
large
force
and
had
cut
the
communications
with
santander
on
returning
to
valladolid
with
the
guard
division
bessières
found
waiting
there
on
july
his
letters
of
recall
to
paris
the
emperor
had
deposed
him
partly
in
consequence
of
complaints
as
to
his
intractability
made
by
king
joseph
partly
because
he
was
dissatisfied
at
the
hopeless
tone
of
his
dispatches
in
which
to
his
master
s
discontent
he
kept
setting
forth
the
thesis
that
the
war
in
spain
was
being
conducted
on
a
wrong
system
and
that
the
army
of
the
north
was
helpless
his
post
was
given
to
general
dorsenne
a
man
of
inferior
ability
though
his
operations
prove
him
not
to
have
been
such
a
conceited
imbecile
as
his
jealous
subordinate
thiébault
alleges
indeed
his
record
in
the
north
compares
not
unfavourably
with
that
of
bessières
and
he
was
decidedly
more
ready
to
aid
his
neighbours
than
the
duke
of
istria
which
was
the
main
thing
necessary
among
french
generals
in
spain
see
especially
his
dispatch
to
berthier
of
june
on
fait
illusion

l
empereur
tout
le
monde

le

it
is
most
for
thiébault
s
character
of
dorsenne
see
his
vol
iv
pp
on
the
departure
of
bessières
for
valladolid
his
subordinates
bonnet
and
serras
had
halted
behind
the
orbigo
holding
la
baneza
as
their
advanced
point
santocildes
who
showed
as
much
enterprise
as
prudence
during
his
short
tenure
of
command
learning
that
there
were
now
only
or
men
in
front
of
him
came
down
again
from
his
mountains
on
july
with
all
his
three
divisions
and
advanced
against
them
they
were
forced
after
some
slight
skirmishing
to
abandon
la
baneza
and
the
line
of
the
orbigo
and
to
fall
back
on
leon
santocildes
advanced
to
the
esla
and
roving
detachments
sent
out
from
his
front
pushed
forward
as
far
into
old
castile
as
sahagun
and
palencia
the
got
possession
of
the
whole
and
the
french
garrisons
of
zamora
toro
benavente
and
salamanca
were
completely
cut
off
from
their
communication
with
dorsenne
s
head
quarters
at
valladolid
there
was
equal
trouble
in
the
provinces
of
burgos
and
santander
where
longa
and
porlier
long
held
occupied
the
guard
division
of
general
roguet
evading
him
when
necessary
and
always
returning
to
give
trouble
when
he
had
passed
by
unfortunately
for
the
spaniards
santocildes
was
at
this
moment
superseded
by
general
abadia
whom
castaños
had
sent
to
take
general
command
of
the
army
he
was
in
every
way
inferior
to
his
junior
and
predecessor
being
neither
so
alert
nor
so
cautious
and
having
a
craze
for
unnecessary
innovation
in
matters
of
detail
which
might
have
been
harmless
in
time
of
peace
but
was
vexatious
when
carried
out
during
a
campaign
wellington
had
at
first
conceived
great
expectations
from
his
intelligence
but
soon
became
entirely
disappointed
with
him
see
vii
for
an
account
of
abadia
s
good
intentions
and
viii
for
wellington
s
disappointment
at
their
just
before
abadia
replaced
santocildes
the
position
of
dorsenne
was
wonderfully
improved
by
the
arrival
on
the
ebro
of
the
division
of
souham
strong
which
had
been
promised
to
him
in
june
and
had
been
marching
up
from
marseilles
for
five
weeks
the
commander
of
the
army
of
the
north
at
once
turned
over
the
province
of
burgos
to
souham
and
moved
forward
from
it
the
greater
part
of
the
guard
division
of
roguet
which
thus
became
free
for
operations
in
the
open
field
caffarelli
s
and
reille
s
divisions
were
now
also
present
in
biscay
and
navarre
so
that
the
available
strength
of
the
french
in
northern
spain
was
higher
than
it
had
been
since
the
summer
of
and
dorsenne
thought
that
his
rear
was
adequately
covered
he
therefore
marched
with
the
two
divisions
of
the
young
guard
and
his
two
cavalry
brigades
to
link
his
operations
with
those
of
bonnet
on
the
esla
dorsenne
started
from
valladolid
on
august
marching
in
two
columns
dumoustier
s
division
by
mayorga
and
valencia
de
don
juan
roguet
s
by
villalpando
and
benavente
so
as
to
converge
on
la
baneza
bonnet
strengthened
by
some
reinforcements
advanced
at
the
same
time
from
leon
against
the
bridges
of
the
orbigo
and
astorga
and
dorsenne
with
a
small
reserve
followed
by
the
road
it
was
evidently
intended
that
roguet
s
division
should
turn
the
spanish
right
and
drive
the
whole
army
northward
and
away
from
galicia
while
it
was
attacked
in
front
by
bonnet
and
dumoustier
fortunately
for
his
army
which
was
now
about
to
be
attacked
by
nearly
men
abadia
listened
to
the
advice
of
santocildes
and
withdrew
hastily
to
the
hills
when
on
august
his
outposts
were
attacked
cabrera
s
division
retired
on
its
old
post
of
puebla
de
senabria
and
got
into
communication
with
silveira
s
portuguese
who
had
come
up
to
braganza
castañon
and
the
conde
de
belveder
who
had
just
relieved
taboada
in
command
of
the
division
were
drawn
back
to
the
two
passes
above
astorga
those
of
manzanal
and
fuencebadon
dorsenne
dividing
his
troops
attacked
both
and
carried
them
not
without
severe
fighting
on
july
the
spanish
detachment
in
the
manzanal
pass
was
badly
cut
up
that
before
fuencebadon
suffered
less
the
french
lost
general
corsin
behind
the
passes
there
are
two
lines
of
retreat
into
galicia
the
northern
and
more
obvious
is
the
great
to
corunna
via
villafranca
and
lugo
which
sir
john
moore
followed
in
january
the
southern
and
more
rugged
is
that
by
ponferrada
domingo
flores
and
the
val
de
orres
to
orense
which
la
romana
took
in
that
same
historic
retreat
this
last
road
was
now
chosen
by
abadia
for
two
reasons
the
first
was
that
by
taking
it
he
placed
himself
upon
the
flank
of
dorsenne
s
advance
against
the
heart
of
galicia
and
forced
the
enemy
either
to
turn
against
him
and
follow
him
into
a
remote
and
desolate
country
or
if
he
pressed
on
to
expose
his
communication
with
astorga
and
leon
the
second
reason
was
that
he
knew
that
dorsenne
had
come
lightly
equipped
intending
rather
to
drive
his
army
out
of
the
astorga
region
than
to
conquer
the
whole
province
of
galicia
the
french
would
not
therefore
be
able
to
feed
on
the
desolate
route
between
ponferrada
and
orense
and
would
probably
turn
back
content
with
having
cleared
the
plains
of
leon
our
old
acquaintance
of
gamonal
and
tamames
this
argument
was
correct
dorsenne
went
no
further
on
the
great
than
villafranca
which
he
sacked
on
august
and
then
turned
on
his
heel
refusing
to
press
deeper
into
galicia
or
to
pursue
abadia
s
army
he
marched
back
to
astorga
on
the
burning
every
village
of
the
vierzo
on
his
way
and
descended
into
the
plains
of
leon
abadia
followed
cautiously
reoccupied
villafranca
and
ponferrada
and
pushed
his
outposts
forward
again
to
the
edge
of
the
mountains
it
was
found
that
the
french
were
repairing
astorga
which
they
once
more
garrisoned
and
held
as
an
outpost
till
the
next
year
the
ground
occupied
by
the
army
of
galicia
was
exactly
the
same
on
the
of
september
as
it
had
been
on
the
of
june
save
that
all
asturias
was
still
clear
of
invaders
it
was
not
till
the
late
autumn
that
bonnet
once
more
made
his
appearance
in
that
province
the
reasons
of
dorsenne
s
sudden
retreat
from
the
borders
of
galicia
were
many
and
various
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
his
expedition
had
been
taken
in
hand
with
the
object
of
conquering
that
province
as
napier
seems
to
suggest
such
a
task
would
have
required
much
longer
preparation
than
he
had
been
able
to
make
he
had
neither
collected
the
stores
and
munitions
that
would
have
been
required
for
so
great
an
enterprise
nor
made
the
necessary
dispositions
for
the
protection
of
the
vast
space
behind
him
when
he
marched
against
abadia
he
left
nothing
between
the
ebro
and
the
border
of
portugal
save
souham
s
newly
arrived
division
and
a
few
of
serras
s
battalions
scattered
in
small
garrisons
at
leon
benavente
valladolid
his
movement
of
advance
had
been
made
to
chase
the
army
of
galicia
out
of
the
plains
where
it
had
been
showing
itself
so
persistently
since
june
and
to
relieve
the
pressure
which
it
had
brought
upon
bonnet
and
serras
there
was
no
purpose
of
conquest
underlying
his
march
only
a
desire
to
scour
the
valleys
of
the
orbigo
and
the
esla
of
tiresome
intruders
the
spaniards
were
wholly
mistaken
in
supposing
that
he
retired
from
villafranca
because
abadia
had
shown
a
disposition
to
make
a
long
resistance
or
because
the
junta
had
called
out
the
or
general
en
of
the
province
raised
on
the
principle
of
the
portuguese
ordenança
he
could
have
gone
on
further
if
that
had
been
his
intention
but
he
had
no
such
desire
galicia
was
helpless
and
dorsenne
would
have
taken
coruña
and
ferrol
if
the
arrival
of
wellington
on
the
coa
had
not
alarmed
him
iii
this
statement
shows
a
misconception
of
the
situation
not
only
were
his
munitions
exhausted
but
all
the
news
behind
him
was
unsatisfactory
though
the
reinforcements
from
france
had
arrived
on
the
ebro
old
castile
was
in
the
most
disturbed
condition
there
had
been
a
notable
disaster
at
santander
on
august
when
porlier
by
a
sudden
concentration
had
stormed
the
town
dispersing
general
rouget
s
garrison
and
had
then
swept
away
most
of
the
minor
posts
around
it
only
torrelavega
had
succeeded
in
beating
off
his
assault
but
when
reinforcements
came
flocking
in
the
spaniards
had
retired
to
the
hills
with
prisoners
and
were
threatening
other
points
the
gates
of
palencia
and
valladolid
had
been
insulted
by
who
showed
themselves
boldly
in
sight
of
the
walls
and
established
a
loose
blockade
which
could
only
be
pierced
by
the
movement
of
considerable
columns
but
the
most
pressing
point
was
ciudad
rodrigo
julian
sanchez
had
cut
its
communications
with
salamanca
and
had
defeated
small
bodies
of
or
men
which
had
been
sent
to
reopen
them
a
much
larger
force
had
to
be
detailed
to
throw
provisions
into
the
place
in
july
but
by
the
end
of
august
stores
were
again
running
low
and
general
reynaud
the
governor
whenever
he
could
pass
an
emissary
through
the
lines
of
the
kept
asking
for
help
of
all
kinds
this
general
is
not
to
be
confused
with
roguet
the
guard
commander
though
they
were
operating
in
regions
close
to
each
other
and
often
get
mixed
in
contemporary
narratives
but
since
dorsenne
started
for
his
expedition
against
astorga
the
problem
of
getting
food
into
rodrigo
had
been
complicated
by
the
appearance
of
wellington
s
army
on
the
coa
and
the
agueda
on
august
the
head
quarters
of
the
army
had
been
moved
up
from
the
south
to
fuente
guinaldo
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
blockaded
fortress
and
already
on
august
the
garrison
had
detected
british
outposts
from
the
light
division
in
their
immediate
neighbourhood
now
since
marmont
and
the
army
of
portugal
were
still
in
the
valley
of
the
tagus
and
all
leon
was
still
in
the
charge
of
the
army
of
the
north
dorsenne
found
himself
responsible
for
the
revictualling
indeed
for
the
relief
from
blockade
of
a
fortress
which
might
be
beset
by
men
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
return
from
the
border
of
galicia
and
to
concert
matters
with
marmont
for
a
common
movement
against
wellington
for
the
field
force
of
the
army
of
the
north
which
had
just
driven
abadia
into
the
hills
was
not
over
strong
and
obviously
could
not
succour
rodrigo
by
its
own
unaided
strength
returning
to
valladolid
early
in
september
with
the
two
guard
divisions
and
leaving
bonnet
once
more
to
observe
the
galicians
dorsenne
opened
with
marmont
for
a
general
concentration
against
wellington
of
this
effort
we
must
speak
in
its
due
place
meanwhile
matters
settled
down
in
the
northern
field
of
operations
bonnet
was
too
weak
to
move
or
to
think
of
reoccupying
his
old
post
in
the
asturias
abadia
s
army
was
much
reduced
in
numbers
both
by
privations
and
by
desertion
the
last
days
of
the
late
campaign
spent
in
the
desolate
val
de
orres
had
been
particularly
trying
to
the
troops
an
english
observer
who
saw
them
at
ponferrada
described
them
as
in
even
worse
condition
than
might
be
expected
half
the
soldiers
without
trousers
and
wearing
only
capotes
while
the
clothing
of
the
rest
shows
great
need
for
improvement
they
are
a
fine
body
of
men
standing
well
though
deeply
marked
by
privation
and
as
badly
trained
as
equipped
the
best
corps
can
only
manœuvre
singly
not
attempting
movements
of
the
line
the
toledo
battalion
broke
down
in
attempting
to
change
front
the
cavalry
are
on
a
level
with
the
infantry
move
with
wide
gaps
between
squadrons
and
can
not
go
accurately
through
the
sword
exercise
the
horses
might
each
be
a
rosinante
the
artillery
as
badly
manned
as
horsed
the
numbers
were
terribly
low
it
was
doubtful
whether
the
whole
field
force
could
produce
men
and
they
had
started
on
the
june
campaign
with
from
the
of
sir
howard
british
commissioner
with
abadia
s
army
pp
dilapidated
however
as
the
army
of
galicia
might
be
at
the
end
of
its
operations
it
had
done
well
having
kept
the
french
army
of
the
north
contained
for
the
many
weeks
during
which
wellington
was
absent
on
the
guadiana
bessières
and
dorsenne
had
accomplished
nothing
positive
during
that
time
and
the
territory
held
down
by
the
invaders
in
september
was
less
than
it
had
been
in
june
by
the
whole
extent
of
the
asturias
it
is
absurd
of
napier
to
state
that
galicia
with
its
lordly
junta
its
regular
army
fortified
towns
numerous
population
and
constant
supplies
from
england
had
less
weight
in
the
contest
than
the
portuguese
militia
conducted
by
trant
and
wilson
the
province
so
far
from
being
of
no
weight
in
the
contest
did
wellington
most
useful
service
the
two
diversions
carried
out
by
santocildes
which
twice
compelled
the
army
of
the
north
to
mass
all
its
available
field
troops
on
the
orbigo
were
operations
of
the
most
profitable
sort
and
since
the
galician
always
retired
in
time
led
to
no
disasters
of
the
kind
that
too
often
happened
when
a
peninsular
general
was
overdaring
but
while
paying
his
just
due
to
santocildes
we
must
praise
even
more
the
unwearied
activity
of
the
chiefs
of
the
cantabrian
bands
and
the
guerrilleros
of
old
castile
and
leon
it
was
longa
and
porlier
and
julian
sanchez
who
with
forces
that
were
never
very
great
in
numbers
paralysed
by
their
ubiquity
and
their
unceasing
enterprise
the
greater
part
of
bessières
s
and
dorsenne
s
troops
if
they
had
not
been
in
existence
the
french
might
have
found
men
enough
to
conquer
galicia
or
to
attack
portugal
in
force
this
was
true
throughout
the
whole
of
and
and
was
a
governing
fact
in
the
history
of
the
peninsular
war
even
though
the
emperor
pushed
fresh
infantry
the
divisions
of
souham
reille
and
caffarelli
into
northern
spain
in
july
and
august
he
was
never
able
to
make
the
communication
between
bayonne
and
madrid
absolutely
safe
or
to
call
any
region
subdued
which
was
not
held
down
by
a
garrison
altogether

of
proportion

its
population

soult
s
troubles
in
andalusia
after
his
departure
from
the
guadiana
on
june
soult
found
himself
plunged
into
a
new
series
of
troubles
which
were
to
continue
all
through
the
summer
and
autumn
just
as
he
was
about
to
set
out
for
seville
with
two
cavalry
regiments
as
escort
following
in
the
wake
of
godinot
s
and
conroux
s
infantry
he
received
the
unwelcome
news
that
blake
of
whose
march
he
had
been
aware
since
the
had
crossed
the
lower
guadiana
near
mertola
on
june
and
had
invaded
the
condado
de
niebla
with
nearly
men
if
blake
had
struck
straight
at
seville
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
he
would
have
taken
it
for
general
daricau
the
governor
hastened
on
the
first
news
of
the
approach
of
an
enemy
to
shut
himself
up
in
the
fortified
cartuja
convent
with
his
scanty
garrison
of
convalescents
drafts
and
he
had
not
the
least
hope
of
maintaining
the
large
and
turbulent
city
under
control
but
no
one
appeared
to
molest
him
except
some
cavalry
who
were
easily
driven
off
by
blake
apparently
disliking
to
present
himself
in
the
open
plain
of
the
guadalquivir
had
not
marched
on
seville
but
sat
down
on
june
to
besiege
the
castle
of
niebla
the
capital
of
the
region
which
he
had
invaded
it
was
the
only
french
garrison
left
in
western
andalusia
and
was
held
by
a
battalion
of
swiss
in
king
joseph
s
service
a
miscellaneous
corps
formed
of
deserters
of
all
races
from
the
spanish
and
british
armies
under
a
colonel
fritzhardt
blake
lay
for
five
days
before
the
mediaeval
castle
with
the
division
of
zayas
while
ballasteros
with
the
rest
of
the
army
took
a
position
to
cover
him
against
french
troops
coming
from
estremadura
who
as
was
rightly
suspected
were
not
long
in
appearing
the
siege
failed
because
blake
had
brought
no
artillery
with
him
on
account
of
the
bad
mountain
roads
he
had
sent
his
guns
round
from
mertola
by
ayamonte
and
they
had
not
come
up
an
attempt
to
take
the
castle
by
escalade
failed
and
the
spanish
general
was
sitting
helplessly
before
its
walls
on
july
when
the
news
came
that
the
french
were
upon
him
soult
hearing
on
his
way
southward
of
blake
s
raid
had
turned
both
conroux
and
godinot
against
the
invaders
and
had
continued
his
own
route
to
seville
with
no
more
than
the
cavalry
and
one
infantry
regiment
while
godinot
marched
on
niebla
by
cala
and
aracena
conroux
tried
to
cut
in
between
blake
and
the
sea
by
a
circuitous
route
by
fregenal
through
the
worst
of
the
mountains
aiming
at
the
ports
of
huelva
and
moguer
it
was
hoped
that
the
spaniards
might
be
caught
between
the
two
divisions
but
the
quarry
was
too
shy
blake
departed
at
the
first
alarm
and
embarked
at
ayamonte
with
zayas
s
division
ballasteros
marching
away
into
the
hills
which
he
knew
so
well
evaded
conroux
and
passed
for
a
time
northward
into
the
sierra
de
aroche
the
cavalry
under
penne
villemur
did
not
abscond
by
water
but
returned
along
the
portuguese
frontier
to
estremadura
where
it
joined
the
skeleton
army
of
castaños
which
still
consisted
of
no
more
than
six
or
eight
battalions
under
morillo
and
carlos
de
españa
some
or
men
at
most
wellington
had
sent
it
back
to
villa
viçosa
during
the
operations
around
the
caya
declining
to
use
it
in
the
till
it
should
be
reorganized
blake
whose
embarkation
at
ayamonte
on
july
had
been
accompanied
by
circumstances
of
disgraceful
panic
returned
to
cadiz
with
men
ballasteros
followed
him
thither
six
weeks
later
having
descended
from
the
hills
and
embarked
at
the
mouth
of
the
guadiana
at
the
end
of
august
his
troops
had
plundered
the
portuguese
peasantry
freely
during
their
rapid
march
and
actually
came
to
skirmishing
with
the
local
ordenança
for
anecdotes
by
an
schepeler
see
his
book
for
which
see
schepeler
on
a
false
alarm
the
troops
began
to
embark
on
the
transports
without
orders
and
in
great
disarray
blake
according
to
schepeler
made
a
ridiculous
spectacle
of
himself
by
wading
a
long
way
through
shallow
water
to
get
out
to
a
small
boat
there
were
no
french
within
many
miles
blake
s
niebla
expedition
had
been
conducted
with
the
greatest
timidity
and
incompetence
yet
it
had
served
wellington
s
purpose
much
as
he
had
intended
since
it
drew
off
french
troops
into
a
remote
corner
of
andalusia
for
some
weeks
it
is
true
that
soult
s
original
withdrawal
from
the
guadiana
was
not
caused
by
this
diversion
but
it
had
forced
him
to
send
away
on
a
chase
troops
urgently
needed
elsewhere
for
if
conroux
and
godinot
had
not
marched
to
niebla
and
ayamonte
they
would
have
gone
straight
to
granada
to
reinforce
the
corps
which
was
throughout
the
month
of
july
in
considerable
danger
from
the
murcians
it
was
not
till
august
had
begun
that
soult
was
able
to
come
to
its
aid
with
the
divisions
which
had
been
distracted
to
the
far
west
by
blake
s
expedition
of
freire
s
army
of
murcia
we
have
heard
nothing
since
the
unhappy
rout
of
baza
november
after
that
shock
it
had
kept
quiet
for
many
a
day
and
only
dared
to
move
when
in
april
soult
began
to
make
heavy
requisitions
on
the
corps
in
order
to
form
the
army
that
marched
for
albuera
further
drafts
had
been
called
westward
in
the
end
of
may
so
that
leval
who
succeeded
sebastiani
as
commander
of
the
corps
about
this
time
was
left
with
numbers
quite
inadequate
to
hold
down
the
broad
kingdoms
of
jaen
and
granada
this
of
course
gave
freire
the
chance
of
accomplishing
something
useful
and
leaving
the
frontiers
of
murcia
he
began
to
press
forward
against
the
french
posts
he
had
at
this
time
a
force
of
three
infantry
divisions
under
la
cuadra
sanz
and
creagh
and
two
weak
cavalry
divisions
under
osorio
and
ladrón
the
whole
amounted
after
making
deductions
for
the
garrison
of
cartagena
men
to
nearly
bayonets
and
sabres
in
may
freire
began
to
push
forward
cautiously
with
his
cavalry
and
two
divisions
on
the
and
a
smaller
force
consisting
of
la
cuadra
s
division
on
the
side
road
which
leads
by
huescar
and
pozoalcon
to
the
valley
of
the
upper
guadalquivir
and
the
kingdom
of
jaen
his
progress
was
so
slow
that
the
french
were
able
to
withdraw
at
their
leisure
before
him
without
any
loss
leval
was
so
weak
that
he
made
no
attempt
to
stand
and
evacuated
in
succession
the
coast
lands
about
almeria
as
far
as
motril
the
highlands
east
of
granada
including
the
towns
of
baza
and
guadix
and
the
upper
valley
of
the
guadalquivir
la
cuadra

advanced
posts
penetrated
as
far
as
ubeda
and
bickered
with
the
garrisons
of
baeza

and
jaen
officers
sent
out
from
the
main
column
raised
the
mountaineers
of
the
sierra
nevada
and
bands
of
insurgents
began
to
cut
the
communications
between
granada
and
malaga
at
the
head
of
these
irregulars
was
the
turbulent
conde
de
montijo
of
whom
we
last
heard
when
he
got
into
trouble
for
conspiring
against
the
supreme
junta
he
is
now
found
more
usefully
employed
giving
trouble
to
the
enemy
instead
of
to
his
own
government

leval
reported
to
soult
that
with
the
or

he
had
concentrated
at

he
was
quite
helpless

was
wellnigh
blockaded

that
he
could
keep
in
touch
with
the
polish
division
which
lay
in
and
about
malaga
or
with
the
garrisons
of
jaen
and
cordova
on
the
other
side
he
could
only
collect
a
force
sufficient
to
attack
freire
by
abandoning
all
his
outlying
posts
and
permission
to
do
so
had
not
been
granted
him
he
must
be
reinforced
or
allowed
to
concentrate
his
scattered
troops
and
strike
at
the
enemy
s
main
body
a
few
days
later
the
state
of
affairs
in
eastern
andalusia
became
still
more
threatening
blake
after
embarking
at
ayamonte
on
july
had
two
days
later
returned
to
cadiz
with
the
two
albuera
divisions
of
zayas
and
lardizabal
he
stayed
only
a
fortnight
in
the
island
city
and
got
leave
from
the
regency
to
join
the
army
of
murcia
in
order
that
he
might
dispose
of
all
the
forces
in
that
direction
he
asked
and
obtained
the
control
of
the
valencian
army
also
and
was
made
of
that
province
as
well
as
of
murcia
and
aragon
blake
landed
at
almeria
on
july
with
the
same
troops
that
he
had
brought
back
from
the
west
about
foot
and
horse
from
thence
he
led
them
to
join
freire
s
army
near
baza
and
left
them
there
while
he
himself
taking
zayas
and
some
other
officers
with
him
made
a
hasty
visit
to
valencia
to
receive
over
the
command
from
the
marquis
del
palacio
and
to
see
what
measures
were
necessary
with
regard
to
the
threatening
movements
of
suchet
on
the
side
of
aragon
the
marquis
had
only
taken
over
charge
of
valencia
from
charles
o
donnell
a
few
weeks
before
the
two
divisions
under
lardizabal
and
joseph
o
donnell
vice
zayas
had
joined
freire
on
august
and
a
force
of
infantry
and
nearly
horse
was
thus
concentrated
near
baza
but
freire
being
now
only
the
interim
commander
refused
to
take
any
responsibility
and
remained
apathetically
watching
the
small
french
force
in
granada
which
was
for
the
moment
absolutely
at
his
mercy
he
posted
the
army
in
a
very
strong
position
near
gor
twelve
miles
in
front
of
baza
and
forty
miles
from
granada
it
was
covered
in
front
by
the
ravine
of
one
of
the
tributaries
of
the
guardal
river
and
could
only
be
turned
on
the
flanks
by
a
very
wide
movement
in
difficult
ground
la
cuadra
s
division
remained
at
pozoalcon
some
thirty
miles
away
from
the
main
body
observing
the
kingdom
of
jaen
and
vexing
its
garrisons
by
small
incursions
soult
had
returned
to
seville
after
the
expulsion
of
blake
from
western
andalusia
but
with
no
intention
of
staying
there
for
long
since
it
was
clearly
necessary
to
the
lost
prestige
of
the
french
arms
on
the
side
of
granada
and
to
reoccupy
the
ground
which
leval
had
been
forced
to
give
up
but
he
had
judged
that
there
was
no
desperate
hurry
since
freire
had
shown
himself
such
a
sluggish
adversary
and
though
he
had
already
directed
godinot
s
provisional
division
to
march
on
jaen
in
the
last
days
of
july
he
himself
was
still
at
seville
when
he
received
the
unexpected
news
of
blake
s
disembarkation
at
almeria
on
the
of
that
month
since
the
army
of
murcia
was
thus
reinforced
the
danger
to
leval
at
granada
had
become
imminent
and
it
was
clearly
necessary
to
rescue
him
at
once
accordingly
the
marshal
setting
out
from
seville
on
august
with
four
regiments
of
s
cavalry
and
part
of
conroux
s
infantry
division
arrived
at
granada
by
forced
marches
on
the
godinot
was
at
the
same
time
directed
to
move
from
jaen
and
baeza
against
la
cuadra
to
drive
him
off
from
pozoalcon
and
then
to
fall
upon
the
flank
and
rear
of
freire
s
strong
position
near
baza
this
provisional
division
of
corps
troops
see
had
already
sent
off
some
of
its
battalions
to
join
victor
before
cadiz
since
the
units
belonged
to
the
corps
nothing
could
have
served
soult
better
than
the
chance
that
the
army
against
which
he
was
marching
was
destitute
for
the
moment
of
its
new
and
left
in
charge
of
a
substitute
who
shirked
responsibility
from
august
when
the
albuera
divisions
joined
freire
down
to
the
when
the
reinforcements
reached
granada
the
small
french
force
in
that
city
had
been
in
a
most
dangerous
position
but
nothing
whatever
had
happened
during
the
critical
days
the
spaniards
had
remained
quiescent
behind
the
ravine
of
gor
picking
up
the
small
part
of
the
garrison
of
granada
that
could
be
spared
to
join
his
field
force
soult
marched
against
the
enemy
on
the
of
august
and
was
in
front
of
their
position
on
the
with
infantry
and
horse
seeing
the
enormous
strength
of
the
ground
he
contented
himself
with
making
noisy
artillery
demonstrations
against
freire
s
line
and
waited
for
the
arrival
of
godinot
who
with
bayonets
and
sabres
was
due
to
appear
in
the
rear
of
the
murcians
on
the
if
all
had
gone
well
with
him
as
a
matter
of
fact
godinot
had
marched
against
la
cuadra
on
the
from
baeza
by
the
way
of
jodar
the
spanish
general
who
was
outnumbered
abandoned
his
post
at
pozoalcon
on
the
and
fell
back
towards
huescar
nearer
the
frontier
of
murcia
without
fighting
godinot
therefore
found
nothing
to
prevent
him
from
falling
on
the
rear
of
the
main
hostile
force
and
marched
on
baza
his
approach
was
reported
to
freire
who
detached
against
him
joseph
o
donnell
s
division
of
men
and
ordered
la
cuadra
to
hasten
to
its
aid
and
to
join
in
covering
the
flank
of
the
army
o
donnell
took
post
at
the
fords
of
the
guardal
river
in
front
of
zujar
and
stood
on
the
defensive
hoping
to
be
joined
by
la
cuadra
during
the
course
of
the
day
the
latter
however
had
gone
off
too
far
to
the
east
for
it
to
be
possible
for
him
to
return
in
time
and
o
donnell
was
badly
beaten
by
godinot
on
the
afternoon
of
the
and
lost
a
third
of
his
men
killed
and
wounded
and
dispersed
or
prisoners
by
continuing
his
march
for
another
eight
miles
after
beating
o
donnell
godinot
might
have
seized
baza
and
cut
off
freire
from
his
retreat
on
murcia
but
his
men
were
tired
and
it
was
reported
to
him
that
a
new
spanish
force
la
cuadra
coming
up
over
late
in
the
day
was
approaching
wherefore
he
halted
and
only
sent
out
cavalry
to
search
for
soult
s
flank
and
to
reconnoitre
baza
but
freire
on
hearing
that
o
donnell
was
crushed
and
his
own
rear
threatened
silently
evacuated
his
strong
position
in
the
night
and
marched
through
baza
and
across
godinot
s
front
with
all
his
host
he
got
away
but
soult
detecting
his
retreat
at
dawn
bade
pursue
him
with
all
speed
at
the
head
of
his
horsemen
the
spanish
rearguard
was
caught
up
at
las
vertientes
ten
miles
beyond
baza
freire
ordered
his
cavalry
under
osorio
and
loy
to
face
about
and
protect
the
march
of
the
infantry
but
a
charge
of
pierre
soult
who
led
the
french
advance
brigade
broke
the
spanish
horse
who
fled
in
all
directions
uncovering
the
infantry
the
latter
took
to
the
hills
one
column
consisting
of
the
divisions
of
sanz
and
o
donnell
went
off
southward
and
escaped
without
much
loss
by
oria
and
albox
the
other
containing
the
divisions
of
creagh
and
lardizabal
turned
north
plunged
into
the
murcian
hills
and
made
its
way
by
maria
to
caravaca
la
cuadra
making
a
separate
retreat
in
a
parallel
direction
also
arrived
at
the
place
such
was
their
haste
that
one
column
made
miles
in
the
day
on
the
the
other
stragglers
were
many
there
is
a
good
account
of
this
obscure
campaign
by
schepeler
an
in
his
pp
and
a
longer
one
in
arteche
vol
x
the
murcian
army
was
thus
divided
into
two
masses
neither
of
which
covered
the
main
road
to
the
capital
of
the
province
and
soult
standing
triumphant
at
velez
rubio
with
his
men
united
might
have
marched
on
murcia
had
he
chosen
but
the
way
was
long
some
seventy
miles
and
the
intervening
country
rough
and
thinly
peopled
the
marshal
resolved
not
to
pursue
freire
but
to
devote
himself
to
the
hunting
down
of
the
insurgents
of
granada
and
the
southern
mountains
while
the
main
hostile
army
was
out
of
action
when
therefore
blake
returned
from
valencia
to
pay
a
hasty
visit
to
his
scattered
army
he
found
it
shaken
in
morale
and
weaker
by
men
than
when
he
had
left
it
but
not
destroyed
of
the
two
disjointed
sections
one
descended
in
haste
from
the
northern
mountains
the
other
came
in
marching
parallel
with
the
coast
they
met
at
alcantarilla
in
front
of
the
city
of
murcia
on
august
and
began
to
fortify
a
position
there
but
the
french
had
turned
back
soult
contented
himself
with
reoccupying
baza
with
a
permanent
garrison
and
did
not
cross
the
murcian
frontier
hence
blake
was
able
a
few
weeks
later
to
take
off
to
the
north
not
only
his
own
two
divisions
but
part
of
freire
s
troops
for
service
against
suchet
on
the
side
of
valencia
it
was
a
lucky
chance
for
him
that
the
invasion
of
valencia
from
the
side
of
aragon
only
began
upon
september
more
than
a
month
after
soult
had
returned
into
andalusia
if
it
had
come
earlier
there
would
have
been
no
succours
available
for
the
and
never
very
efficient
army
as
the
valencian
corps
was
now
called
soult
had
not
gone
in
person
further
than
velez
rubio
though
his
light
cavalry
had
pursued
the
flying
spaniards
many
miles
further
as
far
as
the
pass
of
lumbreras
on
august
he
turned
back
and
broke
up
his
army
into
several
columns
who
were
to
hunt
down
the
insurgents
of
the
sierra
nevada
and
the
alpujarras
the
main
body
returned
to
granada
a
flanking
column
occupied
almeria
another
swept
the
valley
of
the
upper
guadalquivir
there
was
much
plunder
and
a
good
deal
of
reckless
shooting
of
inhabitants
for
the
french
were
exasperated
at
the
rising
which
had
taken
place
in
districts
that
had
seemed
for
the
last
eighteen
months
to
be
pacified
but
the
crushing
of
the
insurgents
turned
out
to
be
a
long
business
indeed
eastern
and
southern
andalusia
were
never
so
thoroughly
under
soult
s
control
as
they
had
been
in
and
the
early
months
of
the
count
of
montijo
lurked
persistently
in
the
mountains
and
gained
several
small
successes
over
general
godinot
who
was
in
main
charge
of
the
hunt
on
august
he
captured
two
whole
companies
of
poles
near
motril
and
a
few
days
later
checked
a
column
of
men
under
colonel
remond
he
himself
ultimately
got
off
to
join
the
murcian
army
but
the
local
guerrilleros
continued
the
strife
which
was
to
blaze
up
again
into
a
formidable
conflagration
when
a
new
spanish
regular
force
came
upon
the
scene
this
was
the
division
of
ballasteros
who
as
has
been
already
mentioned
abandoned
his
old
haunts
by
the
rio
tinto
and
the
lower
guadiana
to
land
on
september
at
algesiras
with
men
calling
in
the
serranos
of
the
ronda
mountains
to
his
aid
he
captured
many
small
places
and
forced
soult
to
turn
godinot
s
troops
against
him
thus
the
insurgents
further
east
got
a
momentary
respite
and
soult
s
unending
troubles
took
a
new
turn
but
the
autumn
and
winter
warfare
in
the
extreme
south
of
andalusia
must
be
narrated
in
another
place
suffice
it
to
say
here
that
soult
was
never
in
the
later
months
of
so
free
from
trouble
as
to
find
it
easy
to
send
any
serious
aid
to
drouet
and
the
corps
whose
duty
it
was
to
check
and
contain
hill
s
divisions
in
estremadura
schepeler
mentions
that
during
his
short
halt
on
the
frontier
of
murcia
soult
and
shot
a
french
officer
in
the
spanish
service
captured
on
the
charles
cléry
the
son
of
the
faithful
servant
of
louis
xvi
who
was
so
long
with
his
master
in
the
temple
prison
as
he
had
been
out
of
france
for
many
years
first
in
the
austrian
and
then
in
the
spanish
army
this
was

took
the

down
to
the

of

we
left
suchet
making
vigorous
preparation
for
the
siege
of

within

walls
his
master
had
promised
him
that
he
should
find

s
while
munitions
and
food
for
this
great
enterprise
were
being
collected
the
unemployed
troops
of
the
army
of
aragon
were
occupied
in
scouring
the
mountains
on
the
side
of

always
driving
the
before
them
but
never
able
to
bring
about
their
capture

destruction
meanwhile
macdonald

the
active
part
of
the
french

of
catalonia
about

about

incapable

with
his
divisions
spread
out
in

of

this
officer
bickered
with
macdonald
continually
but
had
achieved
nothing
substantial
since
his
subordinate
sarsfield
cut
up
eugenio

italians
at
the
combat
of
valls
long
weeks
before
his
ambitious
attempt
to
surprise

failed

nevertheless
baraguay

as
we
shall
see
had
no

thrown
upon
his

the

at
their
best

marked
with
approval
all

up

army
of
catalonia
by
making
over
nearly
half
of
its
force
to
the
army
of

a
decree
declared
that
the
three
provinces
of
lerida
tarragona
and
tortosa
were
transferred
to
the
charge
of
suchet
with
so
much
of

augmented

suchet
was
told
both
to
hold
down
his
old
realm
in
aragon
and
to
take
tarragona
furnishing
not
only
a
siege
army
but
a
covering
force
as
well
macdonald
was
no
longer
to
be
the
shield
of
suchet
s
operations
as
during
the
siege
of
tortosa
but
was
to
occupy
himself
on
a
separate
and
minor
system
of
operations
the
imperial
orders
directed
him
to
occupy
cardona
berga
and
urgel
the
centres
of
resistance
in
upper
catalonia
and
to
take
the
rocky

meanwhile
it
was
necessary
to
transfer
macdonald
s
own
person
from
lerida
where
lay
the
troops
that
he
had
to
surrender
to
barcelona
which
was
to
be
for
the
future
the
centre
of
his
activity
so
dangerous
was
the
passage
that
he
had
to
be
given
an
escort
of
no
less
than
infantry
and
horse
taking
the
way
of
manresa
he
started
from
lerida
on
march
and
cut
his
way
through
the
spanish
forces
which
stretched
across
his
path
the
regular
division
of
sarsfield
supported
by
the
of
central
catalonia
gave
him
much
trouble
though
they
failed
to
hold
manresa
which
the
french
stormed
and
wantonly
burnt
they
hung
on
to
the
flanks
of
the
marching
column
repeatedly
attacked
its
rearguard
and
cut
off
or
slew
in
three
days
of
continuous
fighting
some
men
after
reaching
the
llobregat
at
sabadel
macdonald
went
on
to
the
neighbouring
barcelona
while
his
escort
fought
its
way
back
to
lerida
by
the
road
of
igualada
and
joined
suchet
on
april
having
now
got
the
whole
of
his
new
army
under
his
own
hand
suchet
was
able
to
prepare
all
his
arrangements
for
the
march
on
tarragona
ample
provision
had
first
to
be
made
for
the
defence
of
aragon
in
his
rear

were
numerous

not
powerful

in
the
mountains
of
the
south
and
the
army
of

beyond
the
lower
course
of
the

he
set
aside
three
battalions
and
a
cavalry
regiment
to
watch
mina
and
two
battalions
each
for
garrisons
at
saragossa
and
calatayud
he
placed
a
brigade
under
paris
at
daroca
and
another
under
abbé
at
teruel
to
watch
the
southern
insurgents
to
keep
off
the
valencians
he
left
a
regiment
at
morella
and
alcañiz
another
in
garrison
at
tortosa

men
disposed
in
small
forts
along
the
lower

was
given
charge
of
all
the
troops
on

had
orders
to
unite

s
brigades
and
evacuate
the
southern

the
valencians
made
a
serious
advance
against

some

this
left
suchet
battalions
for
the
expeditionary
corps
with
which
he
was
about
to
march
against
tarragona
of
which
nineteen
were
french
two
polish
and
eight
italian
they
amounted
to
just
under
bayonets
since
the
three
divisions
of
the
army
of
aragon
had
all
been
thinned
down
by
the
numerous
detachments
left
behind
he
amalgamated
what
remained
of
them
with
the
french
and
the
italian
brigades
left
to
him
by
macdonald
to
make
up
three
provisional
divisions
for
the
field
under
habert
harispe
and
frère
the
first
had
one
french
and
two
italian
brigades
fourteen
battalions
the
others
two
brigades
each
six
and
nine
battalions
respectively
there
was
a
cavalry
brigade
of
men
under
boussard
and
a
large
provision
of
artillery
and
engineers
for
the
siege
men
of
the
former
of
the
latter
arm
counting
the
auxiliary
services
the
army
had
about
men
no
great
figure
for
the
task
before
it
for
tarragona
was
strong
and
campoverde
had
some
or
regular
troops
at
his
disposition
the
three
divisions
of
sarsfield
eroles
and
courten
besides
such
aid
as
the
miqueletes
might
give
and
this
last
resource
was
not
to
be
despised
though
they
were
not
always
forthcoming
when
they
were
most
required
yet
they
were
not
usually
found
wanting
they
could
never
be
caught
owing
to
their
knowledge
of
their
own
hills
and
they
were
never
discouraged
it
was
arranged
that
the
army
should
march
on
tarragona
by
two
separate
routes
while
the
divisions
of
frère
and
harispe
started
from
lerida
by
the
road
of
momblanch
the
third
division
that
of
habert
was
to
move
from
a
separate
base
tortosa
where
had
been
collected
the
heavy
artillery
and
the
munitions
of
the
siege
the
guns
which
had
taken
tortosa
were
still
lying
there
with
all
the
artillery
reserve
and
it
was
to
escort
them
that
habert
was
detailed
to
take
the
southern
route
along
the
by
the
col
de
balaguer
from
this
direction
too
were
to
come
the
provisions
of
the
army
which
had
been
brought
down
by
water
from
saragossa
and
mequinenza
while
the
ebro
was
in
flood
and
deposited
at
mora
the
nearest
point
on
the
river
to
tarragona
this
division
of
forces
was
perhaps
necessary
but
appeared
dangerous
if
campoverde
when
the
french
commenced
their
movements
had
thrown
himself
with
all
disposable
forces
upon
the
weak
division
of
habert
only
six
battalions
and
had
wrecked
the
there
could
have
been
no
siege
of
tarragona
for
many
a
month
to
come
but
before
the
two
columns
had
started
from
lerida
and
tortosa
and
while
part
of
harispe
s
division
was
out
on
a
final
up
the
valley
of
the
noguera
before
the
had
even
come
up
to
the
front
to
join
his
army
a
message
arrived
from
the
north
which
might
well
have
stopped
the
whole
expedition
on
april
suchet
still
at
saragossa
received
the
astounding
news
that
the
spaniards
had
captured
figueras
the
bulwark
of
northern
catalonia
and
the
most
important
place
with
the
exception
of
barcelona
which
belonged
to
the
french
in
the
whole
principality
the
disaster
had
happened
on
the
night
of
the
and
the
news
of
it
had
been
brought
by
a
spy
paid
by
macdonald
across
the
territory
occupied
by
the
spanish
army
otherwise
it
would
have
taken
still
longer
to
travel
by
the
circuitous
route
through
france
which
was
the
only
way
by
which
news
from
upper
catalonia
could
reach
aragon
macdonald
and
maurice
mathieu
the
governor
of
barcelona
who
added
his
supplications
to
those
of
the
marshal
begged
suchet
to
abandon
for
the
moment
the
projected
siege
of
tarragona
and
to
march
to
their
aid
with
every
man
that
he
could
spare
for
they
must
collect
as
large
a
force
as
possible
to
recover
figueras
and
a
field
army
could
not
be
got
together
from
the
corps
which
had
to
find
a
garrison
of
men
for
barcelona
and
similar
if
smaller
detachments
for
gerona
rosas
hostalrich
mont
louis
palamos
and
other
smaller
places
if
campoverde
should
march
northward
with
the
bulk
of
his
regular
divisions
to
succour
figueras
there
would
be
little
or
nothing
to
oppose
to
him
down
to
this
winter
suchet
could
only
communicate
with
france
up
the
ebro
and
sent
messengers
via
tudela
and
pampeluna
but
he
had
just
opened
a
somewhat
shorter
route
for
himself
via
jaca
and
oleron
which
saved
three
days
even
so
communications
were
intolerably
slow
see
suchet
s
ii
suchet
weighed
the
petition
of
his
colleague
with
care
but
refused
to
assent
to
it
his
decision
was
highly
approved
by
the
emperor
when
he
came
to
know
of
it
and
the
reasons
which
he
gave
for
his
answer
seem
convincing
it
would
take
as
he
calculated
days
to
move
a
division
or
a
couple
of
divisions
from
lerida
to
figueras
across
the
hostile
of
catalonia
and
since
the
disaster
was
already
eleven
days
old
when
the
news
came
to
hand
there
must
be
over
a
month
of
delay
between
the
moment
when
the
spaniards
had
taken
the
fortress
and
that
at
which
the
army
of
aragon
could
intervene
in
that
month
the
fate
of
affairs
in
the
ampurdam
would
have
been
already
decided
the
succours
for
the
garrison
of
northern
catalonia
must
come
from
france
not
from
aragon
figueras
lies
only
twenty
miles
from
the
french
frontier
and
baraguay
d
hilliers
could
be
helped
far
more
readily
from
perpignan
toulouse
or
narbonne
than
from
lerida
national
guards
and
dépôt
troops
could
be
hurried
to
his
aid
in
a
few
days
as
to
campoverde
he
would
be
called
home
at
once
by
a
blow
delivered
against
tarragona
his
capital
and
chief
arsenal
he
must
infallibly
hurry
back
to
defend
it
at
the
head
of
his
field
army
and
macdonald
and
baraguay
d
hilliers
would
then
have
nothing
but
the
miqueletes
opposed
to
them
if
the
corps
with
the
reinforcements
from
france
which
it
must
infallibly
receive
could
not
deal
with
rovira
manso
and
the
rest
it
was
time
to
abandon
the
peninsular
war
the
crisis
whichever
way
its
results
might
lean
was
bound
to
have
come
and
passed
before
the
army
of
aragon
could
be
of
any
use
it
would
almost
certainly
have
ended
in
a
check
for
the
spaniards
since
the
emperor
could
pour
as
many
men
into
the
ampurdam
as
he
pleased
at
the
worst
figueras
would
be
beleaguered
so
soon
as
the
reinforcements
arrived
from
france
and
all
the
best
of
the
spaniards
in
northern
catalonia
would
be
shut
up
in
the
place
and
kept
out
of
mischief
it
was
entirely
to
the
advantage
of
the
imperial
arms
that
the
enemy
should
lock
up
his
men
in
garrisons
for
they
were
much
more
troublesome
when
acting
as
partisans
in
the
mountains
as
suchet
remarks
ii
the
emperor
at
paris
could
have
the
news
of
the
fall
of
figueras
on
april
or
while
he
himself
only
got
it
on
april
for
all
these
arguments
and
others
see
suchet
s
ii
pp
accordingly
on
april
suchet
having
sent
a
direct
refusal
to
macdonald
s
petition
came
up
to
lerida
and
on
the
harispe
s
and
frère
s
divisions
started
off
for
tarragona
by
the
shortest
road
that
through
momblanch
at
the
same
time
habert
with
the
siege
artillery
moved
out
from
tortosa
for
the
same
destination
along
the
by
the
col
de
balaguer
and
cambrils
on
may
both
columns
were
near
tarragona
having
met
with
very
little
opposition
by
the
way
for
campoverde
with
the
larger
part
of
his
field
army
had
gone
off
a
fortnight
before
to
the
north
with
the
intention
of
succouring
figueras
and
the
rest
of
his
regulars
had
retired
into
tarragona
to
form
its
garrison
before
dealing
with
the
long
and
bitterly
contested
struggle
at
tarragona
it
is
necessary
to
explain
how
figueras
had
come
into
the
hands
of
the
spaniards
this
place
was
a
new
and
fortress
built
sixty
years
back
by
ferdinand
vi
to
supplement
the
defences
of
the
catalonian
frontier
thus
it
had
not
the
weaknesses
of
strongholds
like
gerona
or
lerida
where
the
scheme
of
the
fortifications
dated
back
to
the
middle
ages
close
to
the
from
perpignan
to
barcelona
and
only
twenty
miles
from
the
frontier
stands
an
isolated
hill
with
a
flat
top
at
whose
foot
lay
the
original
village
or
small
town
of
figueras
ferdinand
vi
had
fortified
this
hilltop
so
as
to
form
a
circular
bastioned
enceinte
and
thus
created
a
most
formidable
citadel
which
he
named
after
himself
san
fernando
it
dominated
the
little
town
below
and
the
whole
of
the
surrounding
plain
of
the
ampurdam
the
slopes
below
the
wall
are
steep
even
precipitous
in
some
places
and
there
is
only
one
road
leading
up
into
the
place
by
curves
and
zigzags
though
there
are
several
posterns
at
other
points
san
fernando
had
been
one
of
the
fortresses
which
napoleon
seized
by
treachery
in
a
french
detachment
ostensibly
marching
through
the
town
towards
barcelona
had
fallen
upon
and
evicted
the
spanish
garrison
since
then
it
had
formed
the
most
important
base
for
operations
in
northern
catalonia
and
had
been
the
magazine
from
which
the
sieges
of
rosas
and
gerona
had
been
fed
a
long
possession
of
three
years
had
made
the
imperial
generals
careless
and
the
garrison
had
gradually
dwindled
down
to
a
provisional
battalion
of
or
men
mainly
composed
at
this
moment
of
drafts
for
the
italian
and
neapolitan
divisions
of
pino
and
compère
detained
on
their
way
to
the
front
according
to
the
usual
system
the
governor
was
a
guillot
who
seems
to
have
been
a
negligent
and
officer
the
rocky
fortress
was
so
strong
that
it
never
entered
into
his
head
that
his
restless
neighbours
the
miqueletes
might
try
a
blow
at
it
it
was
a
mere
chance
that
on
the
day
when
the
assault
was
delivered
a
marching
battalion
of
italian
drafts
escorting
general
peyri
who
was
coming
up
to
take
command
of
pino
s
late
division
happened
to
be
billeted
in
the
town
below
next
day
they
would
have
been
gone
see
vol
it
was
clearly
guillot
s
carelessness
and
the
small
numbers
of
his
garrison
which
inspired
the
miquelete
chiefs
with
the
idea
of
making
an
attack
by
surprise
on
this
almost
impregnable
citadel
rovira
the
most
active
of
them
got
into
communication
with
three
young
catalans
who
passed
as
and
were
employed
by
the
commissary
bouclier
who
had
charge
of
the
magazines
one
juan
marquez
was
his
servant
the
other
two
pedro
and
ginés
pons
were
all
three
were
mere
boys
the
oldest
not
years
of
age
marquez
got
wax
impressions
of
various
keys
belonging
to
his
master
including
those
of
the
and
of
a
postern
gate
leading
into
them
from
the
foot
of
the
ramparts
and
made
false
keys
from
them
it
was
determined
that
a
picked
band
of
miqueletes
should
attempt
to
force
their
way
into
the
place
through
the
postern
on
the
midnight
of
april
rovira
sent
the
details
of
his
scheme
to
campoverde
who
despite
of
his
late
fiasco
at
barcelona
was
delighted
with
the
plan
and
offered
to
come
up
with
his
field
army
to
the
north
if
the
attempt
should
succeed
the
miquelete
chiefs
conducted
their
enterprise
with
considerable
skill
on
the
of
april
rovira
collected
some
men
at
the
foot
of
the
pyrenees
north
of
olot
and
threatened
to
make
a
descent
into
the
french
valleys
beyond
in
order
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
enemy
on
the
he
for
figueras
and
at
dusk
got
within
nine
miles
of
it
at
one
in
the
morning
his
forlorn
hope
men
under
two
captains
named
casas
and
llovera
came
up
under
the
ramparts
found
their
confederates
waiting
for
them
at
the
postern
and
were
admitted
by
means
of
the
false
keys
they
burst
up
out
of
the
vaults
and
caught
the
garrison
mostly
asleep
the
governor
was
captured
in
his
bed
the
at
the
great
gate
was
surprised
and
the
few
men
who
came
straggling
out
of
the
barracks
to
make
resistance
were
overpowered
in
detail
only
men
were
killed
or
wounded
on
the
part
of
the
french
not
so
many
on
the
spanish
side
and
in
an
hour
or
less
the
place
was
won
the
captors
promptly
admitted
their
friends
from
without
and
ere
dawn
over
catalans
were
manning
the
walls
of
the
fortress
the
material
captured
was
immense
muskets
several
hundred
cannon
a
great
store
of
boots
and
clothing
four
months
provisions
for
a
garrison
of
men
and
francs
in
the
military
chest
general
peyri
with
the
italian
de
which
was
sleeping
in
the
town
below
was
unable
to
do
anything
there
had
been
very
little
firing
and
when
some
fugitives
ran
down
from
san
fernando
it
was
to
tell
him
that
the
place
was
completely
mastered
by
the
enemy
he
put
his
troops
under
arms
and
drew
off
at
daylight
to
bascara
to
gerona
with
his
men
after
having
sent
off
the
bad
news
both
to
baraguay
d
hilliers
on
one
side
and
to
the
governor
of
perpignan
on
the
other
the
former
sent
him
out
a
battalion
and
a
squadron
and
told
him
to
return
towards
figueras
and
to
place
himself

therefore

baraguay
d

did
not
come
to
his

for
some
days
being
unable
to
leave
gerona
till
he
had
called
in
some
dangerously
exposed
outlying
posts
and
had
strengthened

which
was
threatened
by
some
english
frigates
who
showed
signs
of
throwing

ashore
to
besiege

he
then
came
up
with
men
to
join

while
a
more
considerable
force
arrived
from
perpignan
under
general

had
charge
of
the
pyrenean
frontier
and
appeared
with
three
line
battalions
and

more
of
national
guards

having
infantry
and
cavalry
concentrated
d
hilliers
was
able
to
throw
a
cordon
of
troops
round
san
fernando
and
to
commence
its
blockade
on
april
vacani
iii
says
that
the
best
part
of
the
garrison
had
been
out
on
an
expedition
in
the
hills
all
the
day
seeking
for
the
bands
who
were
said
to
be
threatening
the
french
frontier
they
returned
late
at
night
tired
out
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
weary
while
recruits
and
convalescents
were
furnishing
the
few
guards
considered
necessary
in
such
a
strong
place
a
picket
of
neapolitans
who
were
in
charge
of
the
main
gate
were
captured
without
resistance
being
attacked
to
their
surprise
from
the
inside
of
the
fortress
napier
suggests
iii
that
peyri
might
have
tried
to
assail
san
fernando
before
the
enemy
was
properly
settled
down
into
it
this
seems
a
most
doubtful
criticism
he
had
only
men
of
drafts
with
him
neither
he
nor
they
knew
the
topography
of
the
fortress
it
was
pitch
dark
the
strength
of
the
enemy
was
unknown
the
garrison
had
succumbed
in
a
few
minutes
despite
of
all
its
advantages
of
position
to
attack
would
have
been
foolhardy
the
place
however
was
now
fully
garrisoned
rovira
had
thrown
into
it
during
the
week
when
free
entry
was
possible
miqueletes
to
the
number
of
some
making
a
brigadier
named
martinez
one
of
his
most
trusted
lieutenants
the
governor
on
the
a
reinforcement
of
regular
troops
arrived
part
of
the
division
of
baron
eroles
which
had
the
most
northern
cantonments
among
the
units
of
campoverde
s
field
army
eroles
had
marched
from
martorel
by
olot
and
had
captured
on
his
way
the
small
french
garrisons
of
that
place
and
of
castelfollit
making
prisoners
campoverde
sent
messages
to
say
that
he
would
arrive
himself
with
larger
forces
in
a
few
days
having
thrown
courten
s
division
into
tarragona
he
would
bring
up
the
rest
of
his
available
troops
sarsfield
s
division
and
the
remainder
of
that
of
eroles
with
all
the
miqueletes
that
he
could
collect
meanwhile
the
local
of
central
catalonia
pressed
in
close
upon
gerona
and
hostalrich
and
kept
baraguay
d
hilliers
in
a
state
of
great
anxiety
for
he
feared
that
they
might
capture
these
places
whose
garrisons
had
been
depleted
to
make
up
his
small
field
force
the
opportunity
offered
to
the
spaniard
was
not
one
that
was
likely
to
last
for
long
since
napoleon
on
hearing
of
the
fall
of
figueras
had
issued
orders
for
the
concentration
of
some
troops
from
southern
france
a
division
under
general
plauzonne
from
languedoc
and
provence
and
five
or
six
odd
battalions
more
when
these
should
arrive
in
the
end
of
april
or
the
first
days
of
may
the
french
in
northern
catalonia
would
be
too
strong
to
fear
any
further
disasters
but
meanwhile
macdonald
and
baraguay
d
hilliers
had
a
fortnight
of
doubt
and
danger
before
them
the
former
proposed
to
march
himself
to
figueras
with
what
troops
he
could
spare
from
barcelona
but
since
its
garrison
was
only
about
strong
and
the
place
was
large
and
turbulent
it
was
clear
that
he
could
bring
little
with
him
it
was
for
this
reason
that
he
wrote
to
suchet
in
such
anxiety
on
april
and
begged
for
the
loan
of
one
or
two
divisions
from
the
army
of
aragon
till
he
got
his
answer
he
did
not
himself
move
forth
hence
d
hilliers
alone
had
to
bear
the
brunt
of
the
trouble
see
napoleon
xxii
no
plauzonne
s
regiments
were
the
léger
and
line
and
four
battalions
of
the
line
and
one
of
the
léger
also
crossed
the
frontier
there
is
no
doubt
that
campoverde
had
a
fair
chance
of
achieving
a
considerable
if
temporary
success
but
he
threw
it
away
by
his
slowness
and
want
of
skill
though
aware
of
the
capture
of
figueras
on
april
he
did
not
start
from
tarragona
till
the
nor
reach
vich
in
northern
catalonia
till
the
he
had
then
with
him
infantry
mostly
of
sarsfield
s
division
and
horse
rovira
drew
near
to
with
those
of
the
miqueletes
of
the
ampurdam
who
had
not
already
thrown
themselves
into
the
fortress
the
force
collected
ought
to
have
sufficed
to
break
through
the
thin
blockading
cordon
which
baraguay
d
hilliers
had
thrown
round
the
fortress
if
it
had
been
properly
handled
but
campoverde
was
no
general
on
may
the
relieving
army
approached
the
place
the
miqueletes
demonstrated
against
the
northern
part
of
the
french
lines
while
sarsfield
broke
through
at
a
point
on
the
opposite
side
near
the
town
and
got
into
communication
with
eroles
who
came
down
with
men
to
join
him
they
fell
together
upon
the
french
regiment
the
léger
on
this
front
which
took
refuge
in
the
barricaded
town
and
defended
itself
there
for
some
time
according
to
all
the
spanish
narratives
the
three
battalions
in
figueras
presently
offered
to
surrender
and
wasted
time
in
negotiations
while
baraguay
d
hilliers
was
collecting
the
main
body
of
his
forces
in
a
solid
mass
screened
by
an
olive
wood
in
his
march
the
french
general
suddenly
fell
on
sarsfield
s
flank
and
rear
while
he
was
intent
on
the
enemy
in
the
town
alone
a
charge
of
dragoons
cut
up
two
of
the
spanish
regiments
and
the
rest
gave
way
in
disorder
sarsfield
falling
back
towards
the
plain
and
eroles
retiring
into
the
fortress
the
reserve
of
campoverde
and
the
miqueletes
were
never
seriously
engaged
if
they
had
been
used
as
they
should
have
been
the
fight
might
have
gone
otherwise
than
it
did
for
counting
the
garrison
of
san
fernando
and
the
irregulars
the
spaniards
had
a
considerable
superiority
of
numbers
they
lost
over
men
the
french
about
during
the
time
while
the
blockading
line
was
broken
sarsfield
had
introduced
into
san
fernando
some
artillerymen
much
needed
for
the
vast
number
of
guns
in
the
place
and
part
of
a
convoy
which
he
was
conducting
but
the
greater
portion
of
it
including
a
great
drove
of
sheep
was
captured
by
the
enemy
at
the
moment
of
the
rout
so
the
french
narratives
martinien
s
lists
show
three
officers
killed
and
thirteen
wounded
on
may
before
figueras
the
regiments
which
suffered
most
were
the
and
léger
each
with
one
officer
killed
and
four
wounded
if
campoverde
and
his
army
had
been
given
no
other
task
save
the
relief
of
figueras
it
is
probable
that
this
combat
would
have
been
but
the
commencement
of
a
long
series
of
operations
but
he
received
immediately
after
his
check
the
news
that
suchet
had
marched
from
lerida
on
april
and
had
appeared
in
front
of
tarragona
on
may
the
capital
of
catalonia
was
even
more
important
than
figueras
and
it
was
necessary
to
hasten
to
its
aid
for
no
regular
troops
had
been
left
in
the
southern
part
of
the
principality
save
the
single
division
of
courten
which
had
hastened
to
shut
itself
up
in
the
city
accordingly
sarsfield
was
directed
to
take
infantry
and
the
whole
cavalry
of
the
army
and
to
march
by
the
inland
to
threaten
suchet
s
rear
and
his
communications
with
lerida
while
campoverde
himself
came
down
to
the
coast
with
men
embarked
at
mataro
the
nearest
port
in
spanish
hands
and
sailed
for
tarragona
where
he
arrived
in
safety
to
strengthen
the
garrison
eroles
came
out
of
san
fernando
with
a
few
hundreds
of
his
own
troops
before
the
blockade
was
fully
and
joined
rovira
in
the
neighbouring
mountains
leaving
the
defence
of
the
fortress
to
martinez
with
five
regular
battalions
and
miqueletes
eroles
and
rovira
were
the
only
force
left
to
observe
baraguay
d
hilliers
and
since
they
had
only
a
few
thousand
men
mostly
irregulars
they
were
able
to
do
little
to
help
the
place
for
the
besieging
force
was
strengthened
in
may
by
the
arrival
of
plauzonne
s
division
from
france
while
macdonald
came
up
from
barcelona
with
a
few
battalions
and
took
over
the
command
from
baraguay
d
hilliers
by
the
end
of
the
month
he
had
over
men
and
had
begun
to
shut
in
the
fortress
on
its
height
by
an
elaborate
system
of
contravallations
which
he
compares
in
his
memoirs
to
caesar
s
lines
around
alesia
martinez
made
a
most
obstinate
and
praiseworthy
defence
of
which
more
hereafter
and
the
siege
of
figueras
dragged
on
for
many
months
till
long
after
the
more
important
operations
around
tarragona
had
come
to
an
end
but
after
campoverde
s
departure
for
the
south
there
was
never
any
hope
that
it
could
be
relieved
all
that
its
defenders
accomplished
was
to
detain
and
immobilize
the
whole
corps
which
when
it
had
garrisoned
barcelona
and
gerona
and
supplied
the
blockading
force
for
san
fernando
had
not
a
man
disposable
for
work
in
other
quarters
thus
suchet
had
to
carry
out
his
operations
against
tarragona
without
any
external
assistance
whereas
if
figueras
had
never
been
lost
he
might
have
counted
on
much
incidental
help
from
his
colleague
macdonald
this
much
was
accomplished
by
the
daring
exploit
of
april
if
campoverde
had
been
capable
of
utilizing
the
chance
that
it
gave
him
its
results
might
have
been
far
more
important
the
regulars
left
in
san
fernando
were
two
battalions
of
voluntarios
de
valencia
one
of
ultonia
and
two
of
antequera

xxviii
chapter
ii
the
siege
and
fall
of
tarragona
suchet
had
marched
as
has
been
already
mentioned
from
lerida
with
harispe
s
division
on
april
frère
s
division
following
on
the
the
head
of
the
column
reached
momblanch
where
half
a
battalion
was
left
behind
in
a
fortified
post
to
keep
open
the
lerida
road
on
may
the
large
manufacturing
town
of
reus
only
ten
miles
from
tarragona
was
occupied
on
may
the
french
advanced
guard
salme
s
brigade
approached
the
city
and
drove
in
the
catalan
advanced
posts
as
far
as
the
river
francoli
but
the
siege
could
not
begin
till
habert
s
force
escorting
the
should
come
up
from
tortosa
and
this
column
was
much
delayed
its
road
ran
along
the
seaside
from
the
col
de
balaguer
onward
and
codrington
s
squadron
of
english
frigates
and
gunboats
accompanied
it
all
the
way
vexing
and
delaying
it
by
bombarding
it
whenever
it
was
forced
to
come
within
gunshot
of
the
beach
this
was
practically
all
the
opposition
that
suchet
met
with
a
few
miqueletes
had
shown
themselves
in
the
hills
between
reus
and
momblanch
but
they
were
too
weak
to
fight
campoverde
had
carried
off
the
best
both
of
regulars
and
irregulars
to
the
relief
of
figueras
and
courten
who
had
barely
men
in
his
division
had
wisely
shut
himself
up
in
tarragona
where
every
man
was
wanted
for
the
enceinte
was
very
long
and
the
sedentary
garrison
consisted
of
only
five
or
six
battalions
the
troops
inside
the
walls
did
not
amount
when
the
siege
began
to
men
hence
came
the
weakness
shown
in
the
early
days
it
was
not
till
campoverde
s
army
came
back
from
the
north
may
that
an
adequate
defensive
force
was
in
existence
for
such
a
large
fortress
the
composition
of
the
divisions
of
the
army
of
catalonia
was
shifting
and
hard
to
follow
but
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
courten
s
division
consisted
of
three
battalions
of
granada
two
each
of
almanza
almeria
and
america
while
the
sedentary
garrison
contained
four
or
five
battalions
of
the
new
catalan
sections
or
local
line
besides
a
battalion
of
voluntarios
de
tarragona
tarragona
though
some
of
its
fortifications
were
not
skilfully
planned
was
a
very
strong
place
the
nucleus
of
the
works
was
the
circuit
of
the
old
celtiberian
town
of
tarraco
which
afterwards
became
the
capital
of
roman
spain
this
forms
the
upper
city
in
modern
times
it
is
built
on
an
inclined
plane
of
which
the
eastern
end
feet
above
where
the
cathedral
lies
is
the
higher
side
and
the
slope
goes
downhill
and
westward
the
southern
face
that
towards
the
sea
is
absolutely
precipitous
the
northern
one
hardly
less
so
large
fragments
of
the
cyclopean
walls
built
by
the
celtiberians
or
perhaps
by
the
carthaginians
are
visible
along
the
crest
on
both
of
these
sides
on
the
west
the
lowest
part
of
the
old
town
a
line
of
modern
fortifications
divided
the
upper
town
from
the
lower
there
was
a
sharp
drop
along
this
line
in
most
places
it
is
very
steep
and
the
road
of
goes
up
the
hillside
in
zigzags
to
avoid
the
climb
below
the
fortifications
of
the
upper
city
and
divided
from
them
by
a
broad
belt
of
ground
free
of
houses
lay
the
or
lower
city
clustering
around
the
harbour
which
is
an
excellent
roadstead
shut
in
by
a
mole
feet
long
which
runs
out
from
the
corner
of
the
place
the
lower
city
was
enclosed
on
its
northern
and
western
sides
by
a
front
of
six
bastions
its
southern
side
facing
the
port
and
the
open
sea
had
not
and
did
not
need
any
great
protection
it
could
only
have
been
endangered
by
an
enemy
whose
strength
was
on
the
water
and
who
could
bring
a
fleet
into
action
there
was
a
sort
of
citadel
in
the
a
work
named
the
fuerte
real
which
lies
on
an
isolated
mound
inside
the
angle
of
the
walls
about
yards
west
of
the
most
projecting
bastion
of
the
place
the
river
francoli
flows
into
the
sea
at
the
western
end
of
the
harbour
in
the
angle
between
the
river
and
the
port
was
an
outlying
work
fort
francoli
destined
to
keep
besiegers
away
from
the
shipping
which
they
might
easily
bombard
from
this
point
if
it
were
not
occupied
this
fort
was
connected
with
the
lower
town
by
a
covered
way
protected
by
a
long
entrenchment
containing
two
lunettes
apparently
there
was
in
no
road
of
this
sort
up
the
steep
slope
above
the
railway
station
of
the
main
from
valencia
entered
the
upper
city
at
its
end
and
there
was
no
good
road
for
carriages
up
the
point
as
there
is
now
the
despeñaperros
long
since
built
over
the
line
of
the
old
fortifications
of
the
upper
city
is
now
marked
by
a
broad
promenade
the
rambla
de
san
juan
notwithstanding
the
great
strength
of
the
upper
city
it
had
been
furnished
with
a
second
line
of
defence
outside
its
old
roman
walls
low
down
the
hillside
five
forts
connected
by
a
wall
and
covered
way
protected
its
whole
eastern
front
from
the
edge
of
the
heights
as
far
as
the
sea
the
barcelona
road
crawling
along
the
water
s
edge
enters
the
place
between
two
of
these
forts
and
goes
to
the
lower
after
sending
a
steep
bypath
up
to
a
gate
in
the
upper
city
it
is
a
stiff
climb
up
a
very
steep
ascent
to
enter
the
upper
city
by
its
barcelona
on
the
west
and
the
fortress
commands
all
the
surrounding
but
to
the
due
north
there
is
a
lofty
hill
about
yards
from
the
walls
called
monte
olivo
this
dominates
the
lower
town
since
it
is
feet
high
or
more
though
it
is
itself
dominated
by
the
upper
town
an
enemy
in
possession
of
it
has
every
advantage
for
attacking
the
north
front
of
the
lower
town
wherefore
during
the
course
of
the
last
two
years
the
summit
of
the
hill
had
been
entrenched
and
a
very
large
hornwork
the
fuerte
olivo
constructed
upon
it
this
was
a
narrow
fort
following
the
shape
of
the
crest
of
the
hill
with
a
length
of
yards
and
embrasures
for
guns
its
outer
front
was
protected
by
a
ditch
hewn
in
the
solid
rock
its
rear
was
only
slightly
closed
with
a
low
wall
crowned
by
palisades
so
as
to
leave
it
exposed
to
the
fire
of
the
upper
city
if
by
any
chance
the
enemy
should
get
possession
of
it
such
an
extensive
work
required
a
garrison
of
over
men
a
heavy
proportion
of
the
which
formed
the
total
force
of
the
spaniards
at
the
commencement
of
the
siege
when
suchet
arrived
in
front
of
tarragona
and
had
driven
the
spaniards
within
their
works
may
his
chief
engineer
and
artillery
officers
rogniat
and
vallée
had
to
conduct
a
long
and
careful
survey
of
the
fortifications
opposed
to
them
they
concluded
that
the
northern
front
of
the
city
was
practically
impregnable
from
its
precipitous
contours
and
that
the
eastern
front
though
a
little
less
rocky
was
equally
ineligible
because
of
the
trouble
which
would
be
required
to
transport
guns
first
across
the
high
ground
to
the
and
then
down
to
the
seashore
the
south
front
being
all
along
the
water
s
edge
was
inaccessible
there
remained
only
the
western
front
that
formed
by
the
lower
city
where
the
defences
lay
in
the
plain
of
the
francoli
and
had
no
dominance
over
the
ground
in
front
of
them
there
was
an
additional
advantage
for
the
besieger
here
in
that
the
soil
was
partly
river
sand
partly
the
loam
of
suburban
market
gardens
and
in
all
cases
very
easy
to
dig
but
if
they
were
to
attack
the
west
front
the
engineers
required
the
to
accomplish
two
preliminary
operations
for
them
he
must
take
fort
olivo
which
commanded
with
its
flanking
fires
much
of
the
ground
on
which
they
intended
to
work
and
he
must
drive
away
from
the
northern
side
of
the
harbour
the
squadron
which
lay
there
since
its
heavy
guns
would
enfilade
all
works
started
for
the
purpose
of
approaching
the
western
front
of
tarragona
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
mouth
of
the
francoli
this
being
the
programme
laid
down
suchet
took
up
his
positions
round
the
fortress
harispe
s
division
had
charge
of
the
main
part
of
the
northern
front
its
french
brigade
salme
occupying
the
ground
in
front
of
fort
olivo
while
its
two
italian
brigades
stretched
eastward
along
the
distant
heights
curving
round
so
as
to
cut
the
barcelona
road
along
the
with
their
extreme
detachment
frère
s
division
had
the
central
part
of
the
lines
and
lay
on
both
sides
of
the
course
of
the
francoli
river
its
main
force
however
being
on
the
left
bank
habert
s
division
which
had
just
come
up
from
tortosa
was
placed
near
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
facing
towards
the
port
it
formed
the
right
wing
of
the
army
and
covered
the
which
was
established
at
the
village
of
canonge
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
walls
of
tarragona
the
magazines
and
hospitals
were
fixed
at
the
large
town
of
reus
nine
miles
to
the
rear
under
a
considerable
guard
for
though
the
road
from
thence
to
the
french
lines
ran
over
the
gentle
undulations
of
the
coast
plain
yet
there
was
always
danger
that
bands
of
miqueletes
might
descend
from
the
hills
for
some
daring
enterprise
several
of
the
intermediate
villages
were
fortified
to
serve
as
refuges
for
convoys
and
small
parties
on
the
move
some
days
were
lost
to
the
french
in
completing
the
survey
of
tarragona
in
settling
down
the
troops
into
their
permanent
camps
and
in
bringing
up
from
the
rear
along
the
tortosa
road
the
remainder
of
the
and
its
munitions
it
was
not
till
may
that
serious
operations
began
suchet
s
first
object
was
to
drive
away
from
the
northern
end
of
the
harbour
the
english
and
spanish
ships
whose
fire
swept
the
ground
about
the
mouth
of
the
francoli
across
which
his
were
to
be
constructed
with
this
object
a
large
fort
was
constructed
on
the
shore
in
which
very
heavy
guns
fatal
to
shipping
were
to
be
placed
commodore
codrington
who
was
lying
in
the
harbour
with
a
small
squadron
of
two
s
and
two
frigates
assisted
by
several
spanish
gunboats
bombarded
the
fort
incessantly
but
what
he
destroyed
in
the
day
the
french
rebuilt
with
additions
every
night
and
on
may
the
fort
was
sufficiently
completed
to
receive
its
armament
of
the
were
unable
to
cope
with
them
and
the
vessels
of
the
allies
during
the
rest
of
the
siege
were
compelled
to
keep
to
the
south
end
of
the
port
and
could
only
vex
the
besieger
s
subsequent
by
a
distant
and
ineffective
fire
on
the
a
first
parallel
directed
against
the
most
advanced
spanish
work
fort
francoli
was
begun
in
the
low
ground
beside
the
new
fort
before
this
check
to
the
squadron
had
been
completed
a
great
change
in
the
situation
was
made
by
the
arrival
of
campoverde
on
may
with
regular
troops
brought
by
sea
from
mataro
fractions
of
the
divisions
of
eroles
and
sarsfield
though
neither
of
these
generals
had
come
in
person
the
garrison
being
strengthened
up
to
men
and
raised
in
morale
by
the
reinforcement
became
very
bold
and
enterprising
sorties
began
almost
at
once
harispe
s
division
having
seized
on
the
may
two
slight
outlying
entrenchments
below
fort
olivo
three
battalions
sallied
out
on
the
and
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
retake
them
it
failed
but
on
the
an
equally
vigorous
sortie
was
made
against
the
fort
beyond
the
francoli
and
the
first
parallel
near
it
by
about
men
who
drove
in
the
and
destroyed
a
section
of
the
works
but
were
finally
thrust
back
into
the
lower
city
by
the
arrival
of
reinforcements
led
by
general
habert
how
hot
the
fighting
had
been
here
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
suchet
s
dispatch
owns
to
a
loss
of
over
men
with
three
officers
killed
and
eleven
wounded
the
sallying
force
lost
a
figure
which
suchet
enlarges
in
his
report
to
killed
and
wounded
on
the
the
spaniards
made
a
third
sally
on
a
different
front
far
to
the
across
the
high
ground
north
of
the
barcelona
road
and
tried
to
break
through
the
line
of
blockade
kept
up
by
harispe
s
italian
brigades
this
was
on
a
smaller
scale
and
had
no
luck
it
was
apparently
intended
to
open
up
communication
with
sarsfield
who
marching
by
circuitous
ways
across
central
catalonia
had
reached
valls
and
alcover
only
ten
miles
from
tarragona
on
the
upper
francoli
with
men
this
trifling
force
was
to
be
the
nucleus
of
an
army
of
relief
which
was
to
be
collected
from
all
quarters
to
threaten
suchet
s
rear
sarsfield
made
his
appearance
known
to
his
chief
in
tarragona
by
lighting
beacons
on
the
mountain
tops
learning
that
the
spanish
force
was
insignificant
suchet
detached
two
battalions
and
some
cuirassiers
to
drive
sarsfield
further
away
from
alcover
and
did
so
with
small
loss
forcing
him
to
retire
to
the
mountains
above
valls
the
regiments
that
landed
with
campoverde
seem
to
have
been
the
of
savoia
battalions
voluntarios
de
gerona
and
two
of
the
andalusian
regiments
which
had
formed
the
core
of
reding
s
old
granadan
division
which
marched
to
catalonia
in
viz
iliberia
and
santa
fé
the
first
three
battalions
strong
the
other
with
two
about
this
time
the
french
artillery
and
engineer
commanders
reported
to
their
chief
that
it
would
be
at
least
ten
days
before
they
were
in
a
position
to
begin
a
serious
attack
against
the
western
front
of
the
city
and
suchet
resolved
that
the
enforced
delay
should
be
utilized
for
an
attack
on
fort
olivo
whose
capture
would
sooner
or
later
be
a
necessity
if
the
main
operations
against
the
city
were
to
prosper
accordingly
while
the
approaches
against
the
west
front
went
steadily
on
a
separate
offensive
advance
against
the
olivo
was
prepared
between
the
and
the
of
may
trenches
were
pushed
towards
the
fort
and
batteries
containing
thirteen
guns
erected
to
bear
upon
it
their
fire
had
effected
serious
damage
on
the
parapets
and
the
artillery
of
the
fort
by
the
yet
the
engineers
reported
that
they
could
not
fill
the
ditch
which
was
dug
in
the
solid
rock
and
could
not
promise
to
make
accessible
breaches
beyond
it
but
they
reported
that
the
rear
face
of
the
work
which
the
french
artillery
could
not
reach
was
very
weak
the
low
wall
and
palisade
closing
the
gorge
being
no
more
than
nine
feet
high
there
was
also
a
gap
in
the
front
protection
caused
by
the
entry
into
the
right
end
of
the
fort
of
an
aqueduct
which
carried
water
down
into
tarragona
this
structure
made
a
sort
of
bridge
across
the
ditch
it
had
not
been
cut
but
only
closed
with
palisades
which
were
being
rapidly
demolished
by
the
french
cannonade
this
discovery
was
the
work
of
the
italian
engineer
officer
vacani
whose
work
on
the
campaign
of
the
italian
troops
of
napoleon
in
spain
is
one
of
the
most
valuable
of
our
original
sources
see
his
vol
pp
he
was
with
the
assaulting
column
on
the
night
of
the
suchet
made
the
rather
rash
venture
of
trying
to
escalade
fort
olivo
at
the
two
weak
points
one
column
was
to
turn
the
work
under
cover
of
the
darkness
and
to
endeavour
to
break
in
at
the
gorge
in
its
rear
the
other
was
to
try
the
imperfect
breach
in
the
right
front
by
crossing
the
aqueduct
though
it
was
only
seven
feet
broad
if
it
should
be
found
that
the
ditch
was
impassable
meanwhile
a
general
demonstration
was
to
be
made
by
scattered
against
the
whole
face
of
the
olivo
so
as
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
enemy
and
the
batteries
down
by
the
francoli
were
to
bombard
the
lower
city
with
the
same
purpose
both
attacks
were
successful
more
by
luck
than
by
their
deserts
for
the
plan
was
most
hazardous
the
column
which
had
gone
round
to
the
rear
of
the
fort
ran
in
upon
a
spanish
regiment
which
was
coming
up
the
hill
to
relieve
the
garrison
the
two
forces
hustled
against
each
other
in
the
dark
and
became
hopelessly
mingled
in
a
close
combat
just
outside
the
postern
gate
of
the
gorge
the
garrison
was
unable
to
fire
upon
their
enemies
because
they
were
intermixed
among
their
friends
and
when
the
fight
surged
against
the
postern
and
the
palisades
the
french
succeeded
in
entering
the
gorge
some
by
scrambling
up
the
low
and
weak
defences
others
by
bursting
in
at
the
gate
along
with
the
spanish
reinforcements
with
whom
they
were
engaged
they
might
have
been
checked
for
the
defenders
were
fighting
fiercely
if
the
other
attack
had
not
also
succeeded
but
at
the
right
front
of
the
fort
where
the
second
assault
was
made
though
many
of
the
forlorn
hope
fell
into
the
ditch
a
desperate
charge
took
the
across
the
gangway
of
the
aqueduct
and
over
the
shattered
palisades
that
blocked
it
the
garrison
could
tell
by
the
noise
of
the
musketry
that
the
enemy
had
entered
both
in
front
and
in
rear
and
were
stricken
by
despair
but
the
greater
part
of
them
clubbed
together
and
continued
a
desperate
resistance
which
was
only
subdued
when
suchet
sent
in
all
his
reserves
and
the
to
back
the
stormers
they
were
then
beset
on
all
sides
and
finally
overwhelmed
three
battalions
of
iliberia
were
holding
the
fort
on
the
they
had
been
much
tried
and
two
battalions
of
the
of
almeria
were
coming
up
to
relieve
them
vacani
is
very
positive
that
the
stormers
at
the
aqueduct
got
into
the
fort
before
those
at
the
gorge
the
losses
of
the
garrison
were
terrible
of
the
five
battalions
of
iliberia
and
almeria
and
the
two
companies
of
artillery
which
had
been
engaged
some
men
in
all
very
nearly
as
it
would
appear
were
slain
or
captured
the
prisoners
were
about
in
number
many
wounded
including
the
commander
of
the
fort
colonel
gomez
who
had
received
no
less
than
ten
bayonet
stabs
three
or
four
hundred
men
had
been
killed
the
french
had
given
little
quarter
during
the
earlier
part
of
the
fighting
the
remainder
of
the
garrison
had
escaped
into
the
city
by
climbing
over
the
low
wall
of
the
gorge
and
running
down
the
slopes
at
the
moment
of
the
final
disaster
the
french
loss
according
to
suchet
was
only
about
killed
and
wounded
and
probably
did
not
greatly
exceed
that
figure
the
assailants
had
it
must
be
confessed
extraordinary
luck
if
the
turning
column
had
not
become
mingled
with
the
spanish
reinforcements
it
might
never
have
been
able
to
break
into
the
gorge
while
the
other
attack
could
not
have
succeeded
if
the
governor
had
taken
the
proper
precaution
of
cutting
the
aqueduct
which
served
the
stormers
as
a
bridge
for
the
ditch
proved
wholly
impracticable
and
the
breach
could
not
be
approached
suchet
says
that
except
officers
and
men
taken
prisoners
the
whole
of
the
rest
of
the
garrison
had
perished
ii
belmas
iii
speaks
of
prisoners
and
says
that
were
killed
but
acknowledges
that
some
of
the
spaniards
got
away
vacani
says
that
many
spaniards
escaped
but
that
the
bulk
of
six
battalions
were
destroyed
being
captured
and
slain
the
governor
contreras
says
that
there
were
men
in
the
fort
and
that
somewhere
about
were
killed
or
wounded
but
the
figures
must
have
been
lower
iliberia
was
about
strong
almeria
about
there
were
also
gunners
in
the
fort
the
total
garrison
therefore
was
about
but
at
the
end
of
the
siege
a
month
later
iliberia
surrendered
unwounded
men
and
almeria
they
must
have
lost
many
hundreds
during
the
last
six
weeks
of
the
leaguer
yet
were
still
strong
it
is
hard
to
see
that
they
can
have
lost
more
than
or
between
them
on
may
and
very
probably
toreno
and
arteche
are
right
in
putting
the
total
loss
at
only
and
odd
if
so
the
killed
including
the
gunners
must
have
been
only
between
and
the
schepeler
gives
for
the
total
loss
and
i
suspect
is
nearest
of
all
to
the
truth
napier
as
usual
merely
reproduces
suchet
s
figures
on
the
morning
after
the
assault
the
spirit
of
the
spaniards
was
so
little
broken
that
a
sortie
was
made
with
the
purpose
of
retaking
the
olivo
the
survivors
of
the
two
regiments
which
had
lost
it
volunteering
to
head
the
attack
campoverde
thought
that
the
french
might
be
caught
before
they
had
made
new
defences
to
protect
the
weak
rear
face
of
the
fort
but
they
had
built
up
the
entry
of
the
gorge
with
sandbags
and
the
assault
led
by
colonel
o
ronan
a
officer
was
beaten
off
with
loss
though
a
few
daring
men
not
only
reached
the
gorge
but
scrambled
in
through
its
broken
palisades
to
die
inside
the
work
all
the
guns
of
the
upper
city
were
then
turned
upon
the
olivo
and
reduced
its
rear
to
a
shapeless
mass
of
earth
but
this
did
not
seriously
harm
the
french
who
burrowed
into
its
interior
and
made
themselves
strong
there
they
only
wanted
to
be
masters
of
the
hill
because
it
flanked
their
projected
approaches
in
the
low
ground
and
did
not
intend
to
use
it
as
their
base
for
any
further
active
operations
after
the
olivo
disaster
campoverde
held
a
council
of
war
may
and
announced
to
his
officers
that
the
means
by
which
tarragona
could
be
saved
was
the
collecting
of
a
great
army
of
succour
to
fall
upon
suchet
s
rear
he
was
himself
about
to
depart
in
order
to
take
command
of
it
sarsfield
s
and
eroles
s
small
detachments
all
of
which
he
would
collect
must
form
its
nucleus
the
of
all
central
catalonia
should
be
called
in
and
the
province
of
valencia
had
promised
to
lend
him
a
whole
division
of
regulars
so
saying
he
departed
by
sea
along
with
his
staff
and
a
number
of
the
richer
inhabitants
of
the
city
may
general
caro
who
had
hitherto
acted
as
governor
was
sent
to
hurry
up
the
valencians
and
the
command
of
the
place
was
made
over
to
an
officer
newly
arrived
from
cadiz
general
juan
senen
contreras
who
by
no
means
liked
the
task
assigned
to
him
the
garrison
was
still
strong
for
just
after
the
fall
of
the
olivo
two
battalions
of
regulars
arrived
from
valencia
the
of
the
succours
promised
from
that
province
and
a
draft
of
recruits
landed
from
majorca
it
seems
to
have
been
a
mistake
of
campoverde
to
come
to
tarragona
at
all
his
presence
would
have
been
much
more
valuable
in
the
interior
where
a
supreme
commander
was
much
wanted
and
while
he
was
shut
up
in
the
fortress
from
may
to
may
little
had
been
done
outside
the
junta
of
catalonia
now
sitting
at
montserrat
had
been
issuing
many
proclamations
but
had
not
accomplished
much
in
the
way
of
gathering
in
the
see
his
pamphlet
on
the
defence
of
tarragona
and
his
own
responsibilities
printed
in
the
volume
of
sur
la
guerre
d
apparently
battalion
of
cazadores
de
valencia
and
battalion
of
the
regiment
of
savoia
this
last
must
be
carefully
distinguished
from
the
battalion
of
the
regiment
of
savoia
which
belonged
to
the
catalan
army
and
had
already
been
brought
into
tarragona
on
may
by
campoverde
see
the
history
of
the
two
in
the
conde
de
clonard
s
colossal
work
on
the
regimental
histories
of
the
spanish
line
on
june
campoverde
reached
igualada
and
established
his
head
quarters
there
but
found
only
men
assembled
under
sarsfield
he
sent
that
general
off
to
tarragona
to
act
as
second
in
command
to
contreras
and
took
over
charge
of
his
few
battalions
by
calling
in
eroles
and
hunting
up
deserters
and
detachments
he
had
collected
in
a
fortnight
regular
infantry
and
cavalry
all
that
there
were
of
mounted
men
in
catalonia
the
whole
was
much
too
small
a
force
to
justify
him
in
attacking
suchet
in
his
lines
even
when
the
should
come
in
to
join
him
all
depended
on
the
expected
succours
from
valencia
and
they
were
slow
in
arriving
charles
o
donnell
the
newly
appointed
of
that
province
had
made
up
a
scheme
for
drawing
off
suchet
by
attacking
his
garrisons
in
southern
aragon
and
had
gone
off
early
in
may
with
his
main
force
against
teruel
this
scheme
had
no
effect
whatever
suchet
had
fixed
his
teeth
into
tarragona
and
was
not
to
be
distracted
by
any
demonstrations
against
his
more
distant
detachments
campoverde
grew
so
desperate
that
he
offered
to
give
over
supreme
command
to
o
donnell
if
the
latter
would
come
into
catalonia
with
his
whole
disposable
force
and
begin
by
attacking
mora
suchet
s
great
dépôt
on
the
ebro
the
valencian
though
he
refused
to
take
this
responsibility
finally
agreed
to
send
a
division
of
regulars
under
general
miranda
by
sea
to
join
the
catalans
this
force
about
strong
appeared
at
tarragona
on
june
and
came
ashore
but
was
immediately
afterwards
reshipped
by
campoverde
s
orders
and
transferred
to
villanueva
de
sitjes
where
it
landed
and
marched
inland
to
igualada
to
join
the
army
of
succour
which
by
its
arrival
was
raised
to
nearly
regular
troops
while
campoverde
was
slowly
beating
up
his
reinforcements
tarragona
was
already
in
grave
danger
the
formal
attack
on
the
lower
city
began
on
the
night
of
june
when
vallée
and
rogniat
the
commanders
of
the
french
artillery
and
engineers
declared
that
they
had
everything
ready
the
front
selected
for
attack
was
the
two
bastions
those
called
san
carlos
and
orleans
but
as
a
preliminary
task
it
was
necessary
to
drive
the
spaniards
out
of
the
subsidiary
and
external
defence
formed
by
the
outlying
fort
francoli
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
by
the
long
entrenchment
which
joined
it
to
the
city
with
the
lunette
of
the
prince
a
very
small
work
inserted
in
its
midst
for
fort
francoli
had
a
position
which
would
enable
it
to
enfilade
the
french
trenches
when
they
should
draw
near
to
the
enceinte
of
the
city
on
the
night
of
june
the
french
threw
up
their
first
parallel
at
a
distance
of
only
a
little
over
yards
from
the
bastion
of
orleans
it
was
connected
with
the
entrenchments
beyond
the
francoli
by
a
zigzag
trench
on
the
second
night
the
parallel
was
completed
for
a
length
of
yards
and
three
batteries
begun
in
it
one
directed
against
the
lunette
of
the
prince
and
the
line
joining
it
to
fort
francoli
the
other
two
against
the
bastion
of
orleans
and
the
adjacent
curtain
on
june
the
besiegers
began
to
work
forward
by
a
flying
sap
towards
the
fort
and
by
the
had
pushed
their
front
trench
to
within
twenty
yards
of
the
work
on
that
same
day
the
artillery
began
to
play
against
it
not
only
from
the
new
batteries
but
from
the
old
ones
beyond
the
river
which
had
previously
been
directed
against
the
fleet
the
fort
was
weakly
built
and
a
practicable
breach
was
made
in
its
left
face
before
the
bombardment
had
been
twelve
hours
in
progress
serious
damage
had
also
been
done
to
the
long
entrenchment
connecting
fort
francoli
with
the
lower
city
contreras
rightly
regarding
the
work
as
untenable
ordered
its
serviceable
guns
to
be
removed
the
moment
after
dusk
set
in
and
bade
its
commander
colonel
roten
to
draw
off
the
garrison
two
battalions
of
the
regiment
of
almanza
they
withdrew
at
and
an
hour
and
a
half
later
three
french
columns
charged
out
of
the
trenches
and
seized
the
fort
they
were
surprised
to
meet
with
no
resistance
not
having
detected
the
withdrawal
of
the
spaniards
finding
themselves
unopposed
they
tried
to
push
along
the
entrenchment
from
the
fort
towards
the
town
but
were
stopped
with
some
loss
by
the
guns
of
the
prince
lunette
suchet
in
his
memoirs
conceals
the
fact
that
the
fort
was
already
abandoned
when
his
troops
entered
ii
but
the
evidence
of
contreras
schepeler
and
other
spanish
authorities
is
clear
and
unanimous
the
spanish
engineers
had
assured
contreras
that
the
fort
francoli
would
be
untenable
under
the
fire
of
the
neighbouring
bastion
of
san
carlos
the
battery
on
the
mole
on
the
other
side
of
the
harbour
and
the
heavy
guns
of
the
a
fierce
fire
was
opened
against
it
from
all
these
quarters
but
proved
insufficient
to
stop
the
french
from
burrowing
into
the
ruins
of
the
fort
connecting
it
with
their
trenches
and
finally
building
in
its
right
front
a
heavy
battery
which
bore
along
the
line
of
the
entrenchment
and
enfiladed
the
prince
lunette
this
work
faced
northward
and
exposed
only
a
weak
flank
to
the
attack
fort
francoli
having
ceased
to
be
an
obstacle
the
besiegers
could
now
throw
out
a
second
parallel
from
the
first
which
they
had
constructed
in
front
of
the
bastion
of
orleans
five
new
batteries
were
placed
in
it
some
bearing
on
orleans
some
on
san
carlos
and
one
having
the
special
task
of
beating
down
the
prince
lunette
the
spanish
guns
in
the
lower
city
answered
with
a
fierce
fire
which
caused
much
damage
and
took
many
lives
but
the
work
nevertheless
went
on
unceasingly
on
june
all
the
new
batteries
were
ready
to
commence
their
work
contreras
had
been
much
chagrined
by
the
complete
failure
of
the
best
efforts
of
his
artillery
to
hold
back
the
advance
of
the
enemy
and
reports
that
the
morale
of
the
troops
was
disagreeably
affected
by
the
arrival
of
the
valencian
division
of
miranda
on
june
and
its
prompt
departure
after
staying
less
than
two
days
in
the
place
the
garrison
had
looked
upon
it
as
a
seasonable
reinforcement
and
were
dashed
in
spirits
when
it
made
no
stay
with
them
it
seems
to
have
been
a
complete
mistake
to
have
brought
these
men
to
tarragona
at
all
they
should
have
been
landed
at
once
in
villanueva
de
sitjes
to
join
the
army
of
succour
nevertheless
the
governor
did
his
best
to
delay
the
progress
of
the
french
attack
and
when
his
artillery
proved
ineffective
sent
out
two
strong
sorties
on
the
and
which
did
some
damage
to
the
trenches
but
were
driven
back
in
the
end
as
was
inevitable
on
the
all
the
new
french
batteries
were
ready
as
well
as
that
in
fort
francoli
and
the
bombardment
began
the
advanced
batteries
were
within
yards
of
the
bastions
which
they
were
attacking
and
had
a
tremendous
effect
by
evening
there
was
the
commencement
of
a
breach
in
the
left
face
of
the
orleans
bastion
and
several
other
parts
of
the
enceinte
were
badly
damaged
as
was
also
the
prince
lunette
this
had
not
been
effected
without
grave
loss
one
french
battery
had
been
silenced
a
reserve
magazine
had
been
blown
up
and
the
loss
in
men
among
the
artillery
had
been
very
heavy
nevertheless
the
assailants
had
the
superiority
in
the
cannonade
and
were
well
satisfied
after
dark
the
columns
of
stormers
carried
the
prince
lunette
by
assault
one
of
the
parties
having
slipped
round
its
flank
by
descending
on
to
the
beach
where
a
few
yards
at
the
water
s
edge
had
been
left
unfortified
the
battalion
of
the
regiment
of
almanza
which
held
the
work
was
practically
exterminated
thus
the
spaniards
lost
the
last
of
the
outer
protections
of
tarragona
and
the
captured
lunette
became
the
emplacement
of
one
more
battery
destined
to
play
upon
the
bastion
of
san
carlos
june
the
first
was
a
big
affair
men
under
sarsfield
taking
part
in
it
but
oddly
enough
it
is
not
mentioned
by
suchet
or
belmas
it
was
clear
that
the
crisis
was
now
at
hand
the
french
were
now
lodged
close
under
the
walls
of
the
city
and
had
already
damaged
its
enceinte
but
to
storm
it
would
be
a
costly
business
and
contreras
showed
no
signs
of
slackening
in
his
energy
though
his
letters
to
campoverde
and
his
narrative
of
the
siege
both
show
that
he
thought
very
badly
of
his
position
it
was
clear
that
both
sides
must
now
utilize
their
last
resources
suchet
had
already
ordered
up
from
beyond
the
ebro
the
brigade
of
abbé
which
had
hitherto
been
observing
the
valencians
in
order
that
its
men
might
compensate
him
for
the
heavy
losses
that
he
had
suffered
contreras
began
to
call
on
the
very
hotly
for
help
at
his
departure
campoverde
had
promised
that
the
army
of
succour
should
be
pressing
suchet
s
rear
within
seven
days
and
now
seventeen
had
elapsed
and
no
signs
of
its
approach
were
to
be
seen
he
complained
bitterly
that
many
of
his
officers
were
failing
him
even
colonels
had
gone
off
by
sea
to
villanueva
de
sitjes
pretending
sickness
or
absconding
without
even
that
excuse
naturally
the
spirit
of
the
rank
and
file
had
suffered
from
this
desertion
there
is
good
contemporary
spanish
authority
for
the
notion
that
contreras
himself
contributed
somewhat
to
the
discouragement
by
exhibiting
too
openly
his
failing
hope
and
stating
that
tarragona
must
fall
in
a
fortnight
if
the
field
army
did
not
save
it
but
so
far
as
practical
precautions
went
he
did
his
duty
strengthened
the
damaged
places
in
the
walls
as
best
he
could
and
devoted
much
energy
to
seeing
that
the
troops
were
properly
paid
and
fed
and
that
the
breaches
were
mined
and
protected
to
the
rear
by
cuttings
and
traverses
very
different
was
the
conduct
of
campoverde
who
showed
that
he
was
absolutely
unfit
for
command
by
his
miserable
conduct
during
the
critical
weeks
after
having
been
joined
by
miranda
s
valencian
division
on
june
he
had
regular
troops
under
his
hand
a
force
insufficient
to
meet
suchet
in
the
open
field
but
quite
large
enough
to
give
the
french
grave
trouble
indeed
to
make
the
continuance
of
the
siege
impossible
if
it
were
properly
handled
but
to
bring
effective
pressure
upon
the
enemy
it
was
necessary
to
come
up
close
to
him
and
campoverde
for
many
days
tried
a
policy
which
was
bound
to
fail
he
kept
far
away
cut
suchet
s
communication
by
placing
himself
at
momblanch
and
sent
eroles
and
other
officers
to
molest
the
french
detachments
on
the
lower
ebro
and
to
cut
off
the
convoys
coming
up
from
tortosa
and
lerida
apparently
he
hoped
that
these
distant
diversions
would
cause
suchet
to
draw
off
great
part
of
his
army
from
the
siege
in
order
to
succour
his
outlying
posts
but
the
french
general
did
nothing
of
the
kind
and
took
no
notice
of
the
loss
of
convoys
or
the
danger
to
remote
dépôts
he
stuck
tight
to
the
siege
and
at
this
very
time
by
calling
up
abbé
s
brigade
from
the
south
to
tarragona
he
had
deliberately
risked
even
more
than
before
on
the
side
of
valencia
between
the
and
the
june
the
critical
days
in
the
siege
campoverde
and
his
men
had
no
effect
whatever
on
the
course
of
operations
yet
he
kept
sending
messages
to
contreras
promising
him
prompt
assistance
and
on
the
bade
him
dispatch
sarsfield
out
of
the
city
to
assume
command
of
his
old
division
in
the
fighting
which
was
just
about
to
begin
that
fighting
never
took
place
to
the
s
eternal
disgrace
for
at
the
last
moment
he
flinched
from
placing
himself
within
engaging
distance
of
suchet
it
seems
clear
that
his
true
policy
was
to
push
much
closer
to
the
enemy
s
lines
so
as
to
force
the
french
to
come
out
against
him
and
then
either
to
let
them
attack
him
in
some
strong
position
in
the
hills
to
the
of
tarragona
where
their
cavalry
would
have
been
useless
or
else
to
avoid
an
engagement
by
a
timely
retreat
when
suchet
should
have
been
drawn
well
away
from
the
fortress
in
either
case
he
would
have
compelled
his
adversary
to
draw
so
many
men
away
from
the
siege
that
it
could
not
have
proceeded
for
it
would
have
been
useless
for
suchet
to
march
against
him
with
less
than
or
men
and
the
total
of
the
besieging
army
had
dwindled
down
to
by
this
time
while
abbé
s
reserve
brigade
had
not
yet
come
up
probably
as
napier
suggests
a
blow
at
the
french
magazines
and
hospitals
at
reus
only
ten
miles
from
tarragona
would
have
forced
suchet
to
draw
off
two
divisions
for
a
fight
and
campoverde
need
not
have
accepted
it
unless
he
had
found
himself
some
practically
impregnable
position
but
to
skulk
in
the
hills
many
miles
away
and
send
detachments
against
outlying
french
posts
could
have
no
effect
it
seems
to
have
arrived
about
june
in
time
for
the
storm
on
the
see
his
memoirs
and
arteche
x
see
especially
schepeler
i
arteche
x
grants
that
he
had
not
the
iron
resolution
of
alvarez
the
governor
of
gerona
but
thinks
that
he
did
his
honest
best
and
this
i
think
can
hardly
be
denied
his
own
narrative
is
simple
and
modest
but
does
not
conceal
the
fact
that
he
was
from
the
first
downhearted
and
feared
the
worst
napier
iii
calls
him
vacillating
and
deceitful
there
is
some
foundation
for
the
former
charge
see
below
but
the
latter
seems
unjustifiable
the
only
evidence
brought
to
justify
the
accusation
can
be
explained
away
see
codrington
s
letters
in
the
appendix
to
napier
vol
iii
while
campoverde
hesitated
suchet
took
the
lower
city
of
tarragona
by
a
vigorous
effort
at
seven
o
clock
on
the
evening
of
the
the
assault
was
delivered
by
five
composed
of
the
massed
grenadier
and
companies
of
all
his
french
regiments
strong
and
supported
by
a
brigade
under
general
montmarie
there
were
now
two
good
breaches
in
the
bastions
of
san
carlos
and
orleans
the
curtain
between
them
had
also
been
much
injured
and
even
the
fuerte
real
the
inner
stronghold
behind
the
orleans
bastion
had
been
damaged
by
shot
and
shell
which
passed
over
the
outer
works
contreras
had
sent
down
into
the
lower
city
out
of
the
men
who
were
still
at
his
disposition
and
had
handed
over
the
charge
of
them
to
sarsfield
the
officer
who
had
the
best
reputation
in
the
whole
of
catalonia
but
by
an
there
was
actually
no
one
in
command
when
the
assault
was
delivered
campoverde
s
dispatch
recalling
sarsfield
to
the
field
army
had
come
to
hand
that
morning
and
contreras
thinking
himself
bound
to
obey
it
sent
sarsfield
a
passport
to
leave
the
city
and
designated
general
velasco
to
take
his
place
sarsfield
whose
courage
can
not
be
impeached
but
whose
judgement
was
evidently
at
fault
on
this
afternoon
left
at
once
embarking
on
board
a
boat
in
the
harbour
at
three
o
clock
without
going
to
see
contreras
or
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
officer
who
was
to
supersede
him
he
merely
sent
for
the
senior
colonel
in
the
lower
city
handed
over
the
command
to
him
and
put
out
to
sea
at
a
moment
s
notice
four
hours
later
when
the
storm
took
place
contreras
was
not
aware
that
sarsfield
had
yet
departed
and
velasco
coming
down
to
take
charge
of
the
troops
found
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
fighting
before
he
had
reached
the
walls
or
discovered
the
manner
in
which
their
garrison
was
distributed
there
was
clearly
something
wrong
here
apparently
sarsfield
and
contreras
were
not
on
good
terms
and
the
former
acted
with
small
regard
for
the
welfare
of
the
service
toreno
ii
makes
out
that
the
fault
was
with
contreras
and
napier
who
used
far
more
violent
language
says
that
he
acted
a
shameful
part
the
assault
was
momentarily
expected
yet
he
ordered
sarsfield
to
embark
immediately
averring
that
he
had
campoverde
s
peremptory
commands
sarsfield
remonstrated
vainly
saying
that
the
troops
would
be
left
to
an
inefficient
subordinate
but
was
compelled
to
embark
and
velasco
coming
a
few
hours
later
found
only
the
dead
bodies
of
his
garrison
contreras
then
assured
codrington
and
the
junta
that
sarsfield
had
gone
without
orders
and
betrayed
his
post
there
is
much
misrepresentation
in
this
contreras
campoverde
s
command
to
send
him
sarsfield
without
delay
he
passed
the
order
on
to
sarsfield
but
did
not
know
that
the
latter
had
gone
off
without
waiting
a
moment
after
sending
him
a
note
to
say
that
don
josé
carlos
the
senior
colonel
in
the
lower
city
was
incompetent
to
take
command
naturally
contreras
thought
that
sarsfield
would
have
waited
to
see
velasco
and
hand
over
the
troops
to
him
therefore
contreras
was
correct
in
saying
to
the
junta
that
sarsfield
departed
sin
conocimiento
mío
though
he
had
sent
him
a
passport
to
leave
the
town

at

o

suchet
let
loose
the
stormers
who
were
led
by
the
italian
general
palombini
while
to
distract
the
attention
of
the
garrison
to
other
points
he
ordered
a
general
bombardment
of
the
northern
front
and
showed
a
column
on
the
side
of
fort
olivo
the
assault
was
immediately
successful
at
both
the
critical
points
the
forlorn
hope
on
the
side
of
the
orleans
bastion
starting
from
its
ditch
went
up
the
breach
like
a
whirlwind
losing
somewhat
from
the
musketry
fire
of
the
defenders
but
not
from
their
cannon
for
all
had
been
silenced
the
spaniards
were
cleared
out
so
quickly
from
the
bastion
that
they
had
not
time
to
fire
two
mines
which
would
have
blown
up
the
breach
and
the
if
they
had
worked
they
rallied
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
gorge
but
were
driven
from
it
by
the
french
reserve
who
poured
into
the
town
at
the
san
carlos
breach
matters
went
almost
as
rapidly
the
first
attacking
column
was
checked
but
when
the
second
supported
it
the
united
mass
carried
the
breach
and
burst
into
the
town
a
retrenchment
and
a
row
of
palisades
erected
behind
the
breach
were
crossed
in
face
of
a
defence
all
the
columns
having
penetrated
within
the
walls
those
who
turned
to
the
left
attacked
the
fuerte
real
the
weak
and
somewhat
damaged
work
which
served
as
citadel
to
the
lower
city
it
was
carried
by
assault
without
any
great
difficulty
partly
because
its
earthen
ramp
had
been
somewhat
damaged
by
the
bombardment
and
could
be
climbed
at
some
points
but
more
because
the
garrison
defended
themselves
very
badly
and
gave
way
when
they
saw
that
the
streets
on
their
flanks
and
behind
them
were
inundated
by
the
enemy
the
other
section
of
the
stormers
inclining
to
their
right
moved
towards
the
mole
and
the
large
magazines
at
its
base
where
they
met
general
velasco
who
had
only
arrived
at
the
moment
that
the
assault
began
with
the
spanish
reserve
there
was
fierce
fighting
here
for
a
moment
but
turned
by
a
column
which
had
passed
around
their
flank
by
the
quay
at
the
water
s
edge
velasco
s
men
broke
like
the
rest
the
whole
of
the
garrison
rushed
up
the
slope
towards
the
one
gate
which
leads
into
the
upper
city
and
finally
entered
it
under
cover
of
a
heavy
fire
kept
up
from
the
neighbouring
ramparts
contreras
reports
that
some
of
the
pursuers
came
on
so
fiercely
that
they
were
shot
down
while
actually
battering
at
the
closed
gate
the
losses
of
the
two
parties
were
about
equal
in
numbers
contreras
reports
that
he
found
no
more
than
and
odd
men
missing
when
the
battalions
from
the
lower
city
were
reassembled
suchet
gives
killed
and
wounded
as
his
total
loss
the
casualties
on
both
sides
would
have
been
heavier
if
the
garrison
had
fought
better
but
it
is
clear
that
when
the
breaches
were
once
gained
no
serious
attempt
was
made
to
defend
the
fuerte
real
the
retrenchments
or
the
barricaded
houses
of
the
lower
city
only
velasco
s
reserve
battalions
made
any
fight
in
the
streets
the
rest
fled
early
the
french
might
perhaps
have
made
more
captures
they
only
took
wounded
prisoners
if
they
had
not
turned
at
once
to
plundering
the
houses
and
magazines
but
they
fell
into
great
disorder
many
of
the
unfortunate
inhabitants
of
the
quarter
about
the
port
were
not
only
stripped
of
their
goods
but
murdered
and
a
great
number
of
dwellings
were
wantonly
set
on
fire
eighty
guns
were
captured
on
the
walls
of
the
lower
city
and
a
great
quantity
of
food
and
stores
in
the
dépôts
along
the
quay
but
the
soldiers
destroyed
more
than
was
saved
especially
in
the
wine
stores
not
the
least
disastrous
result
of
this
unhappy
affair
was
that
the
harbour
was
now
closed
to
the
spaniards
the
english
and
the
native
merchant
vessels
which
had
hitherto
sheltered
under
the
west
end
of
the
mole
had
to
put
out
to
sea
the
traders
went
off
to
villanueva
minorca
or
valencia
but
codrington
s
squadron
sought
the
bare
roadstead
off
milagro
point
under
the
precipitous
southern
face
of
the
upper
city
here
there
were
no
quays
and
when
the
sea
was
rough
it
was
impossible
to
land
but
in
ordinary
weather
boats
could
communicate
freely
with
the
shore
and
tarragona
was
not
yet
deprived
of
its
access
to
the
water
though
that
access
had
become
difficult
and
dangerous
suchet
proceeded
to
make
it
more
so
on
the
when
he
erected
a
battery
near
the
base
of
the
mole
to
play
on
the
roadstead
landing
however
was
made
rather
exciting
than
dangerous
by
these
guns
which
never
did
much
harm
on
the
morning
after
the
storm
of
the
lower
city
the
french
engineers
began
to
make
surveys
for
the
attack
on
the
inner
line
of
defence
of
tarragona
its
strength
lay
in
its
commanding
position
and
in
the
fact
that
along
many
parts
of
its
short
front
the
ground
just
below
it
was
too
steep
and
too
rocky
to
allow
of
approaches
being
constructed
on
it
its
weakness
was
that
the
wall
was
weak
and
old
a
work
built
only
to
resist
the
cannon
of
that
day
there
was
no
ditch
or
other
outer
defence
unless
a
hedge
of
prickly
aloes
counted
as
such
the
front
was
composed
of
four
bastions
counting
from
north
to
south
they
were
named
san
pablo
san
juan
at
whose
left
side
lay
the
only
gate
jesus
and
cervantes
the
last
named
overhung
the
precipitous
cliff
looking
down
to
the
sea
above
milagro
point
the
french
engineers
reported
in
favour
of
making
the
attack
on
the
curtain
wall
between
san
juan
and
san
pablo
the
ground
here
being
less
steep
than
elsewhere
and
showing
soil
which
could
be
dug
into
there
was
also
some
cover
to
be
found
in
houses
along
the
road
up
to
the
gate
moreover
the
other
or
southern
section
of
the
wall
was
not
only
on
a
steeper
ascent
but
might
be
exposed
to
fire
from
the
ships
in
the
roadstead
below
the
first
parallel
therefore
was
thrown
up
opposite
san
juan
and
san
pablo
with
a
communication
to
the
rear
covered
by
the
buildings
and
gardens
along
the
road
and
three
batteries
were
planned
in
it
and
commenced
on
june
a
fourth
battery
down
in
the
plain
outside
the
city
was
to
by
a
flanking
fire
uphill
this
day
saw
campoverde
s
first
and
last
demonstration
in
favour
of
the
garrison
it
was
a
miserable
affair
driven
to
do
something
by
contreras
s
appeals
and
by
the
openly
displayed
discontent
of
his
own
army
he
at
last
drew
in
close
to
the
french
lines
on
the
his
army
marched
from
momblanch
to
villarodona
fifteen
miles
of
tarragona
on
the
next
day
it
was
divided
into
two
columns
the
first
composed
of
miranda
s
valencian
division
marched
over
the
hills
with
orders
to
fall
upon
the
encampments
of
harispe
s
italian
brigades
on
the
side
of
the
french
lines
the
second
or
catalan
division
under
sarsfield
with
which
went
the
himself
marched
by
another
road
more
to
the
east
and
was
to
come
into
line
on
miranda
s
left
meanwhile
contreras
was
to
make
a
sally
out
of
the
eastern
side
of
tarragona
with
men
of
the
garrison
and
to
attack
harispe
s
rear
when
he
saw
his
front
engaged
with
the
army
of
both
campoverde
s
columns
reached
the
points
designated
for
them
miranda
getting
unopposed
to
pallaresos
and
the
second
division
to
cattlar
three
miles
further
east
suchet
warned
by
his
outlying
cavalry
concentrated
harispe
s
and
part
of
frère
s
divisions
in
the
rear
of
his
lines
to
the
french
left
of
fort
olivo
leaving
habert
abbé
and
the
rest
of
frère
s
troops
to
hold
the
lower
city
and
the
trenches
his
line
composed
of
some
men
including
all
his
cavalry
was
plainly
visible
both
to
the
spaniards
outside
and
those
within
the
city
and
contreras
formed
his
sallying
column
ready
to
rush
down
when
the
first
should
be
heard
but
miranda
on
finding
himself
in
touch
with
the
enemy
sent
back
messages
to
the
effect
that
he
was
not
sure
of
his
route
that
the
french
seemed
very
strong
and
that
he
dared
not
advance
instead
of
depriving
him
of
his
command
and
then
bringing
up
the
second
column
to
the
help
of
the
first
campoverde
after
some
hesitation
gave
him
leave
to
draw
back
and
both
divisions
retired
that
night
to
vendrils
ten
miles
to
the
rear
in
the
eastern
hills
not
a
shot
had
been
fired
and
contreras
whose
men
had
been
waiting
under
arms
the
whole
afternoon
had
to
draw
them
back
into
the
city
without
having
seen
a
single
man
of
the
relieving
army
which
though
only
four
miles
away
was
hidden
from
him
by
the
intervening
hills
so
ended
a
day
of
great
peril
for
suchet
who
with
men
in
front
of
him
and
more
ready
to
attack
his
rear
might
well
have
suffered
a
disaster
or
at
least
have
proved
unable
to
prevent
the
junction
of
the
two
hostile
forces
for
the
spaniards
were
not
bound
to
descend
and
attack
him
in
the
plain
but
might
have
manœuvred
along
the
hills
and
forced
him
to
take
the
offensive
in
unfavourable
ground
under
pain
of
seeing
them
break
his
blockading
line
codrington
summed
up
the
situation
by
writing
to
his
chief
pellew
that
the
marquis
campoverde
blamed
generals
miranda
and
caro
while
the
latter
retorted
the
accusation
and
i
am
inclined
to
think
by
giving
full
credit
to
what
each
says
of
the
other
neither
will
suffer
ignominy
beyond
that
to
which
his
conduct
has
entitled
for
tarragona
as
contreras
was
truly
repeating
in
every
dispatch
that
he
sent
out
was
in
imminent
danger
and
if
the
army
of
succour
did
not
give
it
help
might
fall
at
any
moment
the
city
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
taken
only
four
days
later
campoverde
however
had
now
formed
the
conclusion
that
he
was
still
too
weak
to
attack
suchet
he
wrote
orders
to
contreras
to
send
him
out
of
the
city
his
two
best
regiments
iliberia
and
almeria
and
general
velasco
to
command
them
he
made
a
desperate
appeal
to
the
to
rally
to
his
colours
which
had
little
effect
for
his
reputation
was
now
gone
and
he
was
suspected
of
timidity
or
even
of
treason
finally
he
got
news
that
there
was
a
small
british
expeditionary
force
in
catalan
waters
and
sent
his
lieutenant
eroles
to
sea
to
look
for
it
and
to
invite
it
to
land
at
villanueva
and
join
him
in
a
week
or
so
he
would
have
men
as
he
supposed
and
would
then
try
something
desperate
meanwhile
unjustly
suspecting
contreras
of
cowardice
he
sent
secret
letters
into
tarragona
to
the
of
the
garrison
bidding
them
depose
and
confine
the
governor
if
he
showed
signs
of
capitulating
disgusted
at
this
move
the
generals
showed
the
epistles
to
contreras
who
was
driven
still
deeper
into
despair
by
seeing
that
the
distrusted
him
regarded
his
views
as
to
the
danger
of
the
city
as
exaggerated
and
was
evidently
deferring
succour
for
an
indefinite
period
nevertheless
he
concealed
his
knowledge
of
the
plan
for
his
deposition
and
prepared
under
protest
to
send
the
regiment
of
almeria
off
by
sea
to
dispatch
iliberia
also
he
refused
saying
that
his
garrison
was
already
insufficient
but
rough
weather
on
the
prevented
the
regiment
from
embarking
from
the
dangerous
milagro
roadstead
which
was
unapproachable
by
boats
during
an
east
wind
suchet
freed
from
a
dire
responsibility
by
the
disappearance
of
the
army
of
succour
on
the
night
of
the
resolved
to
hurry
matters
lest
it
should
presently
come
forward
again
in
greater
strength
on
the
following
day
the
siege
troops
pushed
forward
by
zigzag
approaches
to
within
yards
of
the
wall
of
the
upper
city
and
commenced
a
second
parallel
in
front
of
the
curtain
between
san
juan
and
san
pablo
this
was
done
under
a
hot
and
effective
fire
which
cost
many
lives
the
completion
of
the
projected
batteries
and
more
especially
the
hauling
of
their
cannon
up
steep
slopes
and
among
ruins
took
more
time
than
the
engineer
officers
had
calculated
to
be
necessary
it
was
not
till
the
morning
of
the
that
the
heavy
guns
destined
for
the
breaching
had
been
got
into
place
and
that
the
fire
was
opened
these
three
days
the
of
june
were
a
time
of
agony
for
the
unfortunate
contreras
who
was
distracted
from
his
primary
duty
of
preparing
to
receive
the
assault
by
having
to
deal
with
campoverde
s
plot
for
deposing
him
and
other
problems
the
most
important
of
these
was
the
arrival
in
the
roadstead
on
the
of
a
flotilla
which
brought
not
only
some
small
reinforcements
from
valencia
and
murcia
but
about
british
infantry
and
a
of
artillery
under
colonel
skerret
this
little
force
had
been
sent
by
general
graham
from
cadiz
at
the
desire
of
the
regency
which
was
seeking
in
all
quarters
for
help
for
tarragona
colonel
skerret
had
graham
s
orders
to
do
everything
that
could
be
done
for
the
place
short
of
placing
his
detachment
in
any
position
where
it
was
exposed
to
serious
danger
of
having
to
capitulate
he
was
forbidden
to
land
it
if
he
should
think
tarragona
untenable
unless
he
judged
himself
able
to
bring
off
the
troops
by
sea
in
the
moment
of
disaster
on
the
morning
of
his
arrival
the
weather
was
so
rough
that
no
boat
could
get
in
to
the
shore
and
communication
with
contreras
was
opened
up
by
a
sailor
who
swam
ashore
with
a
letter
the
governor
thus
found
himself
offered
the
aid
of
the
british
force
if
he
would
guarantee
that
it
would
be
able
to
escape
should
the
town
fall
a
most
hampering
condition
in
the
evening
the
surf
having
somewhat
abated
colonel
skerret
came
ashore
and
was
joined
next
morning
by
an
engineer
and
an
artillery
officer
as
also
by
general
charles
doyle
and
by
codrington
the
commander
of
the
british
squadron
off
the
catalonian
coast
they
conferred
with
contreras
who
told
them
that
he
feared
the
town
was
untenable
and
that
he
intended
when
the
walls
should
be
breached
not
to
make
a
prolonged
defence
but
to
sally
out
of
the
barcelona
gate
and
to
try
to
cut
his
way
to
join
campoverde
he
thought
that
the
sortie
must
succeed
since
the
french
would
be
intent
on
a
storm
on
the
western
side
of
the
fortress
and
would
never
expect
an
attack
to
be
delivered
at
the
same
moment
from
its
eastern
side
he
therefore
invited
skerret
to
land
his
men
and
take
part
in
the
enterprise
but
if
he
preferred
to
join
him
in
withstanding
the
approaching
storm
by
the
french
he
might
choose
whatever
point
he
liked
in
the
enceinte
and
defend
it
it
is
clear
that
at
this
moment
the
governor
was
himself
hesitating
between
the
two
alternatives
and
that
it
relieved
his
mind
to
throw
the
responsibility
of
choice
on
skerret
the
troops
were
the
a
detachment
of
the
and
some
light
companies
lent
by
the
governor
of
gibraltar
in
all
counting
the
gunners
see
graham
s
dispatches
to
lord
liverpool
and
to
colonel
skerret
of
june
the
british
officers
military
and
naval
spent
the
afternoon
in
going
round
the
city
they
agreed
with
contreras
that
the
wall
was
weak
and
likely
to
be
breached
without
much
difficulty
this
being
so
was
it
consistent
with
graham
s
directions
to
land
the
troops
the
sortie
might
fail
and
the
garrison
spanish
and
english
might
be
driven
back
into
the
town
and
captured
a
defence
of
the
breach
might
also
fail
and
in
that
case
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
get
off
the
troops
by
sea
since
if
skerret
s
own
single
boat
had
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
coming
ashore
in
the
surf
it
was
certain
that
many
boats
hastily
manned
and
crammed
with
soldiers
and
escaping
under
the
fire
of
the
pursuing
french
would
come
to
grief
on
a
large
scale
skerret
and
codrington
after
much
consultation
resolved
that
they
dared
not
bring
the
british
troops
ashore
for
they
could
not
guarantee
that
the
men
could
be
taken
away
again
they
therefore
refused
both
of
contreras
s
alternative
offers
just
at
this
moment
baron
eroles
arrived
from
campoverde
with
an
appeal
to
skerret
to
land
at
villanueva
de
sitjes
and
join
the
army
of
with
codrington
s
approval
the
colonel
consented
to
do
so
and
set
sail
northward
early
in
the
morning
of
the
it
can
not
be
disputed
that
this
whole
business
was
most
unhappy
in
its
results
that
a
british
force
should
appear
in
the
roadstead
for
hours
and
then
depart
without
landing
a
man
appeared
to
the
garrison
of
tarragona
to
prove
that
their
own
condition
was
hopeless
if
there
had
been
a
reasonable
hope
of
defending
the
town
successfully
as
they
argued
the
british
would
have
come
ashore
their
departure
caused
deep
discouragement
and
contreras
was
no
doubt
right
in
stating
that
next
after
campoverde
s
conduct
that
of
skerret
was
the
most
active
cause
of
the
demoralization
which
the
garrison
showed
on
the
next
day
it
would
have
been
far
better
that
the
expedition
should
never
have
appeared
yet
it
is
hard
to
blame
skerret
or
his
adviser
codrington
they
had
graham
s
orders
that
the
men
were
not
to
be
placed
in
a
position
where
they
might
have
to
capitulate
and
it
could
not
be
disputed
that
tarragona
on
june
was
such
a
position
it
would
have
been
better
not
to
tie
skerret
s
hands
by
any
conditions
and
to
leave
him
free
to
act
as
he
thought
best
for
the
interest
of
great
britain
and
spain
the
addition
of
steady
infantry
to
the
force
defending
the
breaches
might
very
possibly
have
wrecked
suchet
s
assault
even
if
their
effort
had
failed
the
loss
of
two
battalions
would
have
been
a
lesser
shock
to
british
prestige
in
eastern
spain
than
their
withdrawal
into
ignominious
safety
at
the
moment
of
danger
that
this
represents
pretty
accurately
what
happened
is
i
think
clear
from
the
comparison
of
codrington
s
very
full
letter
to
general
graham
see
his
i
skerret
s
report
to
graham
and
the
regency
printed
in
arteche
ix
pp
and
contreras
s
own
narrative
of
the
siege
this
version
as
it
will
be
seen
differs
from
that
of
napier
who
is
much
harder
on
skerret
than
he
deserves
though
the
colonel
was
an
unlucky
officer
and
distrusted
by
his
subordinates
see
sir
harry
smith
s
autobiography
pp
the
critical
phrase
of
graham
s
instructions
to
skerret
was
you
will
before
landing
your
detachment
state
to
the
governor
that
you
must
have
at
all
times
free
and
open
communication
with
his
majesty
s
ships
of
war
and
in
the
event
of
the
place
being
under
the
necessity
of
surrendering
that
you
are
at
liberty
to
withdraw
the
troops
on
board
the
said
ships
previous
to
the
the
orders
are
dated
june
contreras
spent
the
few
hours
that
remained
to
him
after
skerret
s
departure
in
hesitation
between
the
idea
of
cutting
his
way
out
of
tarragona
along
the
eastern
road
and
that
of
defending
the
town
to
the
last
possible
moment
he
finally
resolved
that
he
would
hold
the
walls
for
one
day
only
and
would
evacuate
the
city
on
the
night
of
the
if
the
french
had
made
any
impression
during
the
first
hours
of
the
bombardment
the
main
body
of
the
garrison
divided
into
three
columns
was
to
make
its
exit
from
the
rosario
gate
while
men
remained
to
hold
the
walls
as
long
as
they
could
with
orders
to
save
themselves
if
possible
and
follow
the
rest
when
the
enemy
should
break
in
officers
and
men
alike
were
informed
of
this
and
had
their
destined
positions
in
the
sortie
explained
to
them
it
seems
likely
that
the
knowledge
that
they
were
intended
to
abscond
in
a
few
hours
made
the
troops
less
obstinate
in
their
defence
when
the
assault
came
but
meanwhile
contreras
made
proper
preparation
for
holding
back
the
enemy
till
the
destined
time
of
departure
he
told
off
his
best
regiments
to
the
exposed
front
and
constructed
a
second
line
of
defence
behind
it
by
barricading
and
loopholing
the
houses
of
the
rambla
the
broad
street
above
the
enceinte
and
by
blocking
the
narrow
lanes
which
lead
up
to
it
with
barrels
filled
with
stones
so
that
from
wall
to
wall
there
was
a
continuous
inner
fortification
but
all
this
was
a
temporary
arrangement
the
garrison
was
to
hold
out
till
night
only
and
then
escape
by
a
great
sortie
unfortunately
the
sortie
was
never
made
for
suchet
pushed
matters
so
fast
that
the
bombardment
and
the
assault
were
all
over
in
twelve
hours
the
guns
in
the
breaching
batteries
opened
at
dawn
and
soon
began
to
damage
the
weak
old
walls
in
the
most
effective
style
the
french
had
originally
intended
to
make
two
breaches
one
to
the
left
in
the
curtain
near
the
san
pablo
bastion
the
other
to
the
right
nearer
the
bastion
of
san
juan
but
finding
the
latter
hard
to
complete
owing
to
the
misdirection
of
one
of
his
batteries
suchet
had
the
whole
force
of
the
battering
turned
on
to
the
spot
nearer
to
san
pablo
which
he
regarded
as
most
favourable
for
his
purpose
by
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
there
was
a
breach
over
feet
broad
at
this
point
all
the
guns
in
the
adjacent
flanks
of
the
two
bastions
had
been
silenced
and
nearly
all
those
along
the
whole
front
the
explosion
of
a
powder
magazine
had
completely
wrecked
the
cervantes
bastion
at
the
other
end
of
the
spanish
line
notwithstanding
that
the
musketry
fire
of
the
garrison
was
still
unsubdued
and
that
the
breach
was
not
very
wide
suchet
determined
to
risk
all
by
assaulting
the
place
in
the
later
hours
of
the
long
summer
afternoon
three
columns
each
composed
of
men
of
the
d
of
various
regiments
were
sent
forward
into
the
advanced
trenches
men
more
under
general
habert
crept
up
to
the
shelter
of
the
front
houses
of
the
lower
city
a
separate
force
of
five
battalions
under
general
montmarie
marched
outside
the
walls
and
placed
itself
in
the
low
ground
facing
the
rosario
gate
but
out
of
gunshot
this
column
was
to
advance
towards
that
gate
if
the
assault
succeeded
and
was
to
be
admitted
by
the
stormers
if
they
won
their
way
into
the
angle
of
the
upper
city
just
behind
the
breach
from
which
the
gate
was
not
far
distant
at
five
o
clock
the
three
burst
out
from
three
separate
points
of
the
trenches
and
raced
for
the
breach
which
they
reached
by
no
means
simultaneously
for
two
of
them
were
somewhat
hindered
by
the
aloe
hedge
below
the
wall
which
had
not
been
entirely
broken
down
by
the
bombardment
they
received
a
tremendous
musketry
fire
from
the
whole
front
but
only
three
guns
in
the
left
side
of
the
san
juan
bastion
plied
them
with
grape
the
rest
of
the
spanish
artillery
had
been
dismounted
or
disabled
contreras
had
filled
the
breach
with
the
remains
of
the
two
battalions
of
provincial
grenadiers
of
castile
a
corps
which
had
been
serving
with
credit
in
catalonia
since
the
autumn
of
in
support
was
the
regiment
of
almeria
also
reckoned
a
good
unit
the
important
retrenchment
in
the
rambla
was
held
by
the
regiment
of
almanza
of
the
rest
of
his
force
there
was
a
less
proportion
along
the
front
of
attack
and
a
greater
proportion
placed
on
the
unassailed
south
and
north
flanks
of
the
city
than
was
wise
troops
should
have
been
heaped
unsparingly
upon
the
breach
the
first
french
column
that
reached
its
destination
came
on
in
some
disorder
got
up
the
crumbling
débris
on
the
breach
and
recoiled
under
the
musketry
fire
from
its
crest
but
when
the
others
arrived
and
general
habert
and
a
crowd
of
other
officers
put
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
mass
and
led
a
second
assault
it
was
successful
the
stormers
rolled
over
the
summit
of
the
breach
and
trampled
down
the
provincial
grenadiers
the
regiment
of
almeria
which
had
been
placed
behind
in
column
with
orders
to
charge
the
enemy
with
the
bayonet
the
moment
that
he
broke
through
gave
way
according
to
contreras
without
carrying
out
his
command
the
main
body
of
the
french
then
swept
down
into
the
street
behind
the
breach
but
some
turned
to
their
left
to
try
to
open
the
rosario
gate
to
montmarie
and
others
made
to
their
right
and
swept
the
ramparts
as
far
as
the
cervantes
bastion
the
spaniards
had
rallied
at
the
retrenchments
along
the
line
of
the
rambla
and
made
here
a
better
defence
than
on
the
far
more
tenable
walls
the
assault
had
succeeded
in
half
an
hour
the
which
followed
was
prolonged
and
bitter
but
when
the
french
reserves
arrived
and
entered
the
upper
city
the
barricaded
street
was
passed
the
rosario
gate
was
burst
open
so
that
montmarie
s
column
got
in
upon
the
spanish
flank
and
the
resistance
went
to
pieces
contreras
manfully
trying
to
bring
up
a
battalion
of
savoia
his
last
intact
regiment
for
a
charge
was
bayoneted
and
taken
prisoner
one
of
the
divisional
generals
courten
bethinking
himself
of
the
proposed
sortie
that
was
to
have
taken
place
that
evening
led
out
a
disorderly
remnant
of
men
by
the
barcelona
gate
and
tried
to
escape
along
the
seashore
they
had
not
got
far
when
they
ran
into
one
of
harispe
s
italian
brigades
and
some
squadrons
of
à
which
had
been
set
to
watch
this
obvious
when
checked
some
of
the
demoralized
troops
tried
to
turn
back
towards
the
city
others
dispersed
and
strove
to
get
away
across
the
hills
some
hundreds
stripped
and
endeavoured
to
swim
out
to
the
british
ships
which
were
lying
in
the
milagro
roadstead
a
fair
number
of
these
were
saved
by
the
boats
of
the
and
her
consorts
which
ran
inshore
to
pick
them
up
but
many
more
were
cut
down
by
the
french
cavalry
on
the
beach
and
it
was
some
time
before
the
excited
riders
would
give
quarter
and
accepted
the
surrender
of
courten
and
the
survivors
general
velasco
the
in
the
city
had
the
luck
to
escape
across
the
mountains
almost
alone
and
brought
the
bad
news
to
campoverde
codrington
looking
on
from
his
ship
says
that
the
storm
succeeded
almost
immediately
and
that
from
the
rapidity
with
which
they
the
french
entered
i
fear
they
met
with
but
little
i
this
is
borne
out
by
contreras
s
narrative
for
details
of
this
sally
see
codrington
s
letter
of
july
in
his
illustration
tarragona
while
this
ineffective
attempt
at
a
sally
was
in
progress
the
in
the
city
above
was
still
going
on
isolated
bodies
of
the
spaniards
made
a
most
desperate
resistance
colonel
gonzales
the
brother
of
campoverde
attempted
to
hold
out
in
the
cathedral
with
men
but
was
killed
with
all
followers
after
a
brave
resistance
the
fact
that
many
small
parties
defended
themselves
for
a
time
in
barricaded
private
houses
gave
the
french
an
excuse
for
something
that
almost
amounted
to
the
systematic
massacre
of
all
the
larger
dwellings
were
broken
open
whether
shots
had
been
fired
from
their
windows
or
no
and
a
great
proportion
of
their
inhabitants
murdered
of
the
corpses
which
littered
the
streets
of
tarragona
more
than
half
were
those
of
civilians
and
according
to
the
spanish
official
report
women
and
children
were
among
the
slain
as
one
spanish
authority
bitterly
remarks
the
victorious
stormers
generally
gave
quarter
to
any
man
wearing
a
uniform
and
let
off
their
fury
on
priests
and
unarmed
citizens
plunder
was
even
more
general
than
murder
and
there
was
the
inevitable
accompaniment
of
drunkenness
and
rape
knowing
what
happened
at
badajoz
in
april
it
is
not
for
the
british
historian
to
dilate
with
too
great
moral
indignation
on
the
doings
of
suchet
s
soldiery
suffice
it
to
say
that
all
the
atrocities
afterwards
seen
at
badajoz
were
suffered
by
the
unhappy
people
of
tarragona
and
that
the
actual
slaughter
of
was
much
greater
about
inhabitants
are
believed
to
have
been
murdered
at
badajoz
more
than
in
the
catalonian
city
spanish
authorities
state
that
the
poles
and
italians
behaved
decidedly
worse
than
the
native
french
the
officers
made
some
attempt
to
check
the
orgie
but
like
the
british
at
badajoz
they
failed
riot
and
slaughter
went
on
all
night
and
it
was
not
till
the
next
day
that
order
was
restored
one
of
the
most
dreadful
incidents
of
the
storm
was
that
many
individuals
both
soldiers
and
civilians
tried
to
escape
to
the
milagro
roadstead
by
climbing
down
the
precipitous
south
front
of
the
city
and
losing
their
footing
were
dashed

the
garrison
owing
to
the
reinforcements
was
over
strong
at
the
moment
of
the
storm
as
suchet
accounts
for
more
than
prisoners
the
actual
loss
at
the
storm
can
not
have
been
much
over
men
but
to
the
spaniards
killed
or
captured
on
june
we
must
add
the
losses
of
the
garrison
during
the
earlier
operations
it
seems
that
the
army
of
catalonia
lost
in
all
or
men
in
this
disastrous
siege
a
certain
amount
of
the
wounded
however
had
been
sent
off
from
time
to
time
on
english
ships
to
majorca
and
other
safe
destinations
and
survived
to
fight
another
day
the
french
casualties
during
the
siege
amounted
to
killed
and
wounded
a
total
of
this
was
a
very
heavy
proportion
out
of
the
men
who
were
from
first
to
last
engaged
in
the
operations
and
if
the
sick
who
are
not
included
in
suchet
s
report
along
with
the
wounded
are
deducted
from
the
survivors
it
is
clear
that
the
army
must
have
been
reduced
to
a
dangerously
low
figure
by
june
and
that
the
spanish
authorities
who
estimate
the
total
loss
of
their
enemies
at
can
not
be
far
out

but
the
effect
produced
was
worth
the
effort
which
had
been
made
nearly
of
the
regular
troops
of
the
army
of
catalonia
had
been
destroyed
the
great
fortress
which
for
three
years
had
been
the
base
of
the
spanish
resistance
had
been
taken
there
was
now
no
considerable
place
left
in
the
hands
of
the
patriots
solsona
berga
cardona
seo
de
urgel
and
the
other
towns
which
they
still
retained
were
of
small
importance
they
had
lost
their
one
fortified
harbour
and
for
the
future
their
communication
by
sea
with
valencia
the
balearic
isles
and
the
british
fleet
could
only
be
conducted
hastily
and
as
it
were
surreptitiously
for
any
port
to
which
their
forces
in
the
inland
might
descend
for
a
moment
was
always
liable
to
be
attacked
and
seized
by
a
french
flying
column
how
nearly
the
spirit
of
resistance
was
crushed
in
the
principality
by
the
stunning
blow
which
suchet
had
inflicted
will
be
shown
in
our
next
chapter
meanwhile
having
reorganized
his
troops
and
determined
that
the
upper
town
of
tarragona
should
be
fortified
and
garrisoned
but
the
harbour
town
dismantled
and
abandoned
the
french
commander
was
at
liberty
to
proceed
further
with
his
scheme
for
the
conquest
of
eastern
spain
but
there
was
bound
to
be
some
preliminary
delay
before
he
could
deliver
his
great
blow
against
valencia
one
brigade
had
to
be
told
off
to
escort
the
spanish
prisoners
to
saragossa
another
had
to
return
to
the
south
to
deal
with
the
insurgents
of
aragon
who
had
been
left
comparatively
unmolested
while
abbé
was
drawn
off
to
the
siege
suchet
himself
soon
to
be
a
marshal
for
the
emperor
carried
out
his
promise
that
he
should
find
his
baton
within
the
walls
of
tarragona
marched
with
some
or
men
all
that
was
left
disposable
to
open
up
communications
with
barcelona
before
his
departure
he
had
a
curious
interview
with
contreras
the
wounded
general
brought
before
him
on
a
stretcher
was
reproached
with
having
violated
the
laws
of
war
by
persisting
in
the
defence
of
an
untenable
town
when
capitulation
had
been
his
bounden
duty
the
spaniard
made
the
proper
answer
that
any
commander
who
surrenders
before
he
is
obliged
is
a
traitor
and
a
coward
thereupon
suchet
changed
his
tone
and
offered
him
tempting
conditions
if
he
would
take
service
under
king
joseph
this
proposal
being
answered
as
it
deserved
contreras
was
sent
as
a
prisoner
to
the
castle
of

from
which
he
escaped

a
captivity
of
fifteen
months

the
fall
of
figueras
and
the
autumn
campaign
in
catalonia
the
news
of
the
fall
of
tarragona
brought
by
the
fugitive
general
velasco
came
as
a
thunderclap
to
campoverde
and
his
army
of
while
the
had
been
hesitating
marching
and
countermarching
and
sending
about
for
further
reinforcements
the
great
city
entrusted
to
him
had
fallen
it
was
impossible
for
the
simplest
soldier
in
his
ranks
to
fail
to
see
that
the
whole
responsibility
for
its
loss
lay
with
campoverde
and
from
that
moment
his
authority
ceased
and
officers
and
men
alike
began
to
clamour
for
his
resignation
his
former
popularity
in
catalonia
had
most
deservedly
vanished
the
newly
raised
recruits
began
to
melt
away
from
their
colours
the
refused
to
serve
one
whom
they
regarded
as
a
coward
if
not
as
a
traitor
on
the
news
that
a
french
column
had
started
from
tarragona
to
attack
him
campoverde
abandoned
his
head
quarters
at
vendrils
and
fled
inland
to
cervera
where
he
at
last
thought
himself
safe
for
the
moment
his
departure
exposed
the
dépôt
at
villanueva
de
sitjes
where
his
stores
were
lying
and
the
french
seized
it
on
the
making
prize
of
many
ships
not
ready
for
sailing
and
capturing
tarragona
wounded
in
the
hospital
skerret
s
british
were
lying
off
the
place
in
their
transports
just
preparing
to
land
and
to
join
campoverde
as
he
had
desired
finding
that
disembarkation
was
impossible
and
that
the
catalan
army
had
disappeared
skerret
took
his
expedition
back
to
cadiz
after
a
most
humiliating
experience
meanwhile
there
was
high
debate
at
cervera
the
valencian
general
miranda
demanded
that
campoverde
should
at
once
dismiss
him
and
his
division
and
permit
them
to
return
home
by
sea
they
had
been
lent
by
charles
o
donnell
for
the
one
purpose
of
the
relief
of
tarragona
and
that
operation
being
now
impossible
for
the
best
of
reasons
miranda
claimed
leave
to
depart
he
was
naturally
anxious
to
serve
no
longer
under
such
a
miserable
chief
as
campoverde
though
his
own
behaviour
on
june
gave
him
no
right
to
complain
it
was
hard
to
see
how
his
request
could
be
refused
yet
many
of
the
chiefs
of
the
catalan
army
thought
that
the
departure
of
the
valencian
division
implied
the
end
of
all
formal
war
in
the
principality
the
proposal
to
remove
not
only
the
valencians
but
all
the
regular
troops
was
raised
campoverde
feeling
his
authority
gone
and
willing
to
throw
all
responsibility
on
his
lieutenants
called
a
council
of
war
on
july
by
a
majority
of
four
to
three
general
officers
the
meeting
decided
in
favour
of
abandoning
catalonia
altogether
sarsfield
the
of
the
army
gave
a
furious
negative
and
campoverde
himself
made
a
more
timid
objection
to
the
move
but
the
retreat
to
valencia
being
once
voted
the
was
only
too
glad
to
fall
in
with
the
project
and
to
be
quit
of
the
duties
which
he
had
so
ill
discharged
all
the
regulars
were
to
sail
when
a
convenient
exit
to
the
sea
could
be
found
at
the
moment
of
the
council
of
war
suchet
was
on
the
move
in
the
neighbourhood
of
barcelona
and
the
small
ports
usually
available
were
blocked
it
was
a
miserable
resolve
when
figueras
was
still
holding
out
when
the
inland
was
still
intact
and
when
suchet
had
been
obliged
to
disperse
his
troops
and
could
obviously
make
no
general
move
for
some
weeks
fortunately
difficulties
cropped
up
to
prevent
the
evacuation
the
british
commodore
codrington
when
asked
to
prepare
transports
and
convoy
replied
that
although
he
would
strain
any
point
to
restore
to
general
o
donnell
and
to
valencia
the
troops
so
liberally
furnished
by
that
kingdom
he
would
not
embark
the
marquis
of
campoverde
or
any
of
the
troops
belonging
to
catalonia
which
it
was
his
duty
to
assist
in
defending
instead
of
depriving
it
of
that
protection
which
it
had
eroles
manso
and
other
local
catalan
officers
sent
in
equally
strong
protests
they
would
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
the
but
it
would
be
treason
to
withdraw
the
whole
regular
army
and
to
leave
the
principality
to
be
defended
by
the
miqueletes
alone
the
spirit
of
the
people
would
be
brought
low
and
resistance
would
die
down
when
they
knew
that
they
were
abandoned
for
ever
by
the
army

wording
of
the
votes

meanwhile
suchet
had
spent
the
days
while
the
spaniards
were
debating
in
opening
up
the
communications
between
his
own
army
and
barcelona
which
had
so
long
been
out
of
touch
he
marched
with
the
greater
part
of
the
divisions
of
harispe
and
frère
as
has
already
been
mentioned
to
villafranca
and
villanueva
de
sitjes
where
he
left
the
bulk
of
his
troops
then
by
the
pass
of
ordal
to
barcelona
itself
here
general
maurice
mathieu
was
in
a
very
isolated
position
for
since
macdonald
had
taken
off
all
the
disposable
troops
to
the
siege
of
figueras
the
city
had
been
entirely
cut
off
from
him
the
having
intercepted
the
road
while
english
cruisers
maintained
a
fairly
effective
blockade
on
the
side
of
the
sea
suchet
concerted
with
the
governor
a
plan
for
opening
up
communication
with
macdonald
and
occupying
the
port
of
mataro
north
of
barcelona
where
the
spaniards
still
had
an
access
to
the
sea
he
determined
to
bring
up
harispe
and
frère
and
went
back
to
pick
them
up
this
he
did
and
returned
with
them
to
barcelona
on
july
while
an
expedition
sent
out
by
maurice
mathieu
seized
mataro
but
meanwhile
campoverde
reflecting
that
if
the
little
ports
between
tarragona
and
barcelona
were
blocked
to
him
there
still
remained
those
between
barcelona
and
rosas
had
made
a
rapid
march
through
the
inland
and
had
arrived
at
arens
de
mar
north
of
mataro
before
suchet
returned
to
barcelona
the
bulk
of
miranda
s
division
was
safely
shipped
off
on
july
by
codrington
and
transported
to
valencia
but
the
cavalry
refusing
to
abandon
their
horses
had
turned
westward
under
a
colonel
gasca
and
to
the
number
of
some
saved
themselves
by
a
most
extraordinary
march
striking
across
northern
aragon
and
dodging
between
the
french
garrisons
they
reached
the
upper
ebro
near
tudela
where
they
forded
the
great
river
by
the
aid
of
guides
lent
them
by
the
great
guerrillero
mina
once
on
the
south
bank
they
executed
another
equally
dangerous
march
evading
many
french
detachments
and
rejoined
charles
o
donnell
in
the
end
of
august
having
travelled
in
six
weeks
no
less
than
miles
through
the
heart
of
a
region
which
was
supposed
to
be
in
military
occupation
by
the
enemy
their
loss
was
only
four
officers
and
men
though
horses
had
perished
in
the
mountains
this
achievement
sufficiently
shows
the
superficial
nature
of
suchet
s
occupation
of
aragon
he
could
not
prevent
so
large
a
body
as
men
from
crossing
it
twice
from
end
to
end
codrington
says
that
he
only
embarked
men
out
of
the
who
had
come
to
catalonia
the
cavalry
had
gone
another
way
and
or
men
had
deserted
some
to
join
the
others
to
find
their
way
home
to
valencia
as
best
they
could
campoverde
after
shipping
off
miranda
s
infantry
at
arens
de
mar
had
retired
inland
to
vich
where
on
the
evening
after
the
embarkation
his
disastrous
came
to
an
end
for
he
found
waiting
him
there
general
luis
lacy
sent
by
the
cadiz
regency
to
relieve
him
in
command
the
new
chief
was
a
stranger
to
catalonia
and
the
people
would
have
preferred
eroles
to
lead
them
indeed
a
junta
of
catalan
officers
had
already
offered
to
put
themselves
under
his
orders
but
eroles
the
most
honourable
of
all
the
local
leaders
refused
to
commit
an
act
of
indiscipline
and
lacy
was
recognized
as
while
campoverde
absconded
hastily
by
sea
rejecting
all
idea
of
evacuating
the
principality
lacy
drew
back
into
the
mountains
with
the
mere
wreck
of
an
army
which
had
been
handed
over
to
him
some
or
men
and
established
himself
at
solsona
where
the
junta
of
catalonia
also
took
refuge
in
this
place
and
the
neighbouring
he
began
to
reorganize
his
demoralized
troops
and
to
gather
in
recruits
and
deserters
but
he
was
far
too
weak
to
do
anything
for
the
garrison
of
figueras
which
was
still
holding
out
though
nearing
its
last
gasp
apparently
while
the
army
was
at
agramunt

about
july

suchet
after
failing
to
prevent
the
embarkation
of
the
valencian
division
had
determined
to
spend
some
time
in
opening
up
free
communication
between
barcelona
and
macdonald
s
army
in
front
of
figueras
as
also
between
barcelona
and
his
own
base

he
must
set
matters
on
a
satisfactory
footing
in
catalonia
before
undertaking
the
great
invasion
of
valencia
which
the
emperor
had
assigned
as
his
next
task
the
expedition
towards
macdonald
s
rear
was
accomplished
by
suchet
himself
with
the
divisions
of
frère
and
harispe

column
palombini
s
italians
marched
up
the
valley

larger
column
followed
the
congost
river
neither
met
with

they
joined
at
the
defile
of
centelles
above

occupied
on

and
flying
columns
sent
out
from
it
to
ripol
olot
and
castelfollit
by
means
of
these
detachments
suchet
got
into
touch
with
macdonald
who
was
found
to
be
holding
figueras
closely
blocked
and
to
be
in
no
need
of
help
for
though
his
army
was
sickly
yet
the
besieged
garrison
was
known
to
be
in
a
desperate
condition
and
its
surrender
was
expected
to
occur
at
any
moment
determining
that
macdonald
could
shift
for
himself
and
would
be
able
to
overrun
all
northern
catalonia
when
his
army
was
set
free
from
the
siege
suchet
turned
back
from
vich
with
the
object
of
achieving
his
second
aim
the
clearing
of
the
road
from
barcelona
to
lerida
this
great
route
was
safe
for
large
detachments
indeed
montmarie
s
brigade
had
marched
along
it
almost
unmolested
ten
days
back
but
it
could
not
be
used
by
convoys
or
small
parties
so
long
as
the
spaniards
were
in
possession
of
the
mountain
of
montserrat
which
overhangs
it
for
many
miles
this
lofty
peak
the
projecting
angle
of
one
of
the
chief
catalan
sierras
was
the
nearest
point
to
barcelona
now
in
the
hands
of
the
patriots
it
was
occupied
at
this
moment
by
eroles
and
some
miqueletes
who
continually
made
descents
into
the
plain
from
their
fastness
the
montserrat
is
a
fantastic
pile
of
rock
whose
highest
point
reaches

composed
of

formation

on

coast
were
generally
forwarded
to
montserrat
for
distribution
the
mountain
was
not
regularly
fortified
indeed
it
was
too
large
for
fortification
but
there
were
two
batteries
with
ten
guns
placed
across
the
only
practicable
road
which
led
up
to
the
sanctuary
from
the
north
and
the
buildings
themselves
far
above
had
been
loopholed
and
barricaded
nothing

its

protected
a

away
in
places
the
aspect
of
the
peak
was
formidable
but
its
strength
was
more
apparent
than
real
when
it
was
held
by
no
more
than
irregular
troops
for
over
and
above
the
known
paths
there
were
many
places
where
lightly
equipped
men
could
scramble
over
slopes
which
were
only
precipitous
in
certain
sections
when
a
very
large
force
delivered
a
concentric
attack
on
the
mountain
it
was
impossible
for
the
small
garrison
to
block
every
possible
point
up
which
active
assailants
might
make
their
way
suchet
had
brought
up
more
than
men
for
the
attack
including
a
battalion
or
two
borrowed
from
the
garrison
of

abbé

to

by

on
july
the
assault
was
delivered
by
abbé
s
five
battalions
they
were
scarcely
opposed
on
the
lower
slopes
but
met
with
a
fierce
resistance
at
the
first
battery
near
the
chapel
of
saint
cecilia
yards
from
the
monastery
here
the
column
halted
to
throw
out
swarms
of
skirmishers
over
the
precipitous
hillside
some
of
them
climbed
high
enough
to
bring
an
enfilading
fire
to
bear
on
the
spanish
guns
and
as
their
discharge
began
to
slacken
the
grenadier
companies
charged
up
the
road
and
captured
them
the
miqueletes
fell
back
on
the
second
battery
which
was
presently
captured
in
the
same
fashion
by
the
combination
of
a
flanking
fire
and
a
frontal
attack
the
spanish
gunners
the
only
regulars
present
stood
to
their
guns
to
the
last
in
the
most
gallant
way
and
were
nearly
all
bayoneted
abbé
was
rearranging
his
column
for
an
attack
on
the
fortified
monastery
above
when
furious
firing
was
heard
to
break
out
in
its
direction
and
the
garrison
were
presently
seen
streaming
down
the
hillside
to
the
east
a
large
body
of
the
french
skirmishers
thrown
out
for
the
first
attack
had
found
their
way
over
the
rocks
to
the
back
of
the
sanctuary
where
there
are
rough
tracks
leading
to
some
hermitages
which
lie
out
far
from
the
main
buildings
when
some
men
had
collected
behind
the
monastery
they
delivered
an
attack
on
it
from
the
rear
the
small
reserve
placed
in
the
buildings
was
by
an
attack
from
this
side
all
the
more
so
because
they
saw
the
rest
of
their
comrades
recoiling
from
the
batteries
below
which
had
already
been
taken
they
fled
after
making
no
great
stand
and
joining
the
main
body
rushed
down
the
precipitous
ravines
on
the
east
front
of
the
peak
where
a
few
perished
by
falls
but
the
majority
got
away
safely
over
ground
where
the
victors
could
not
follow
so
fell
montserrat
with
a
loss
of
only
men
to
the
french
and
to
the
spaniards
the
storming
of
the
holy
mountain
was
a
picturesque
rather
than
a
really
difficult
achievement
but
the
blow
inflicted
on
the
catalans
was
a
very
severe
one
montserrat
had
been
looked
upon
as
impregnable
and
the
protection
of
its
patroness
was
supposed
to
have
defended
it
for
the
three
years
during
which
the
french
had
been
holding
barcelona
which
lies
so
close
to
its
foot
the
spaniards
had
now
no
post
left
on
the
great
road
from
barcelona
to
lerida
and
suchet
disposed
part
of
his
army
to
hold
this
line

he
had
subdued
all
that
part
of
the

had
been
made
over
to
him
when
napoleon
broke
up
the
old
corps
and
assigned
the
districts
of
lerida
tortosa
and
tarragona
to
the
army
of
aragon
he
had
now
before
him
the
invasion
of
valencia
and
intended
to
take
it
in
hand
so
soon
as
the
brigades
escorting
the
tarragona
prisoners
should
have
returned
to
saragossa
and
the
southern
regions
of

should
have
been
cleared
of
the
insurgents
who
had
flocked
down
into
them
from

hills

had
been
withdrawn
to

remotest
recesses
of

meet
but
the

could
not
be
taken
in

before
the
month
of

had
begun
meanwhile
the
siege
of
figueras
had
lingered
on
for
a
month
longer
than
macdonald
and
suchet
had
expected
the
brigadier
martinez
with
his
five
small
regular
battalions
and
his
miqueletes
had
made
a
most
admirable
defence
no
assistance
not
even
any
prospect
of
assistance
had
been
before
them
since
campoverde
s
defeat
on
may
the
whole
field
army
of
catalonia
had
been
drawn
away
to
defend
or
relieve
tarragona
and
martinez
had
no
friends
near
him
save
the
of
the
ampurdam
and
the
pyrenean
valleys
who
were
willing
but
weak
and
disorganized
their
most
popular
chief
the
fighting
priest
rovira
had
gone
off
to
cadiz
to
ask
for
succour
but
found
there
that
tarragona
was
rightly
considered
a
far
more
important
place
to
save
and
that
there
was
no
hope
for
figueras
all
that
the
could
do
was
to
molest
macdonald
s
convoys
and
foraging
parties
may
june
and
july
wore
slowly
away
and
martinez
was
still
holding
out
with
a
garrison
reduced
to
yet
he
was
doing
good
service
since
he
was
detaining
in
front
of
him
the
whole
of
the
disposable
troops
of
the
corps
not
to
speak
of
some
battalions
of
national
guards
from
the
southern
departments
of
france
no
help
from
macdonald
could
come
to
suchet
during
the
whole
of
the
siege
of
tarragona
or
the
subsequent
operations
about
montserrat
instead
it
was
suchet
who
was
forced
to
help
macdonald
by
clearing
his
rear
by
the
march
to
vich
one
of
ultonia
two
of
antequera
and
of
the
voluntarios
de
valencia
the
duke
of
tarentum
had
completed
a
great
circumvallation
around
the
rocky
fortress
of
san
fernando
and
had
pushed
forward
batteries
to
within
yards
of
its
walls
but
he
never
attempted
to
breach
them
or
to
storm
the
place
it
is
hard
to
make
out
why
he
made
no
such
endeavour
for
though
the
place
is
high
lying
and
difficult
of
approach
it
is
not
more
so
than
the
upper
city
of
tarragona
with
which
suchet
was
dealing
in
such
a
prompt
and
drastic
fashion
but
from
march
to
august
figueras
was
blockaded
rather
than
besieged
macdonald
s
proceedings
are
all
the
more
difficult
to
understand
because
his
army
was
suffering
severely
from
the
heat
during
june
and
july
the
national
guards
and
the
newly
arrived
battalions
from
the
interior
of
france
were
thinned
by
malarial
fevers
and
by
pestilence
bred
by
long
tarrying
in
unsanitary
camps
probably
we
must
ascribe
his
refusal
to
open
trenches
and
proceed
to
and
assault
to
his
memory
of
what
had
happened
at
gerona
the
corps
had
an
evil
tradition
of
the
repeated
failures
to
storm
that
city
and
of
the
loss
of
life
which
had
accompanied
them
figueras
it
was
clear
must
fall
sooner
or
later
from
starvation
there
was
no
chance
that
it
could
be
relieved
was
it
worth
while
to
waste
good
soldiers
in
taking
by
force
a
place
that
must
yield
in
a
week
or
two
for
want
of
provisions
macdonald
evidently
the
obstinacy
of
the
defenders
and
the
amount
of
their
stores
and
may
have
regretted
in
july
that
he
had
not
started
a
regular
siege
in
may
but
it
was
now
too
late
to
begin
it
since
surrender
was
inevitable
within
a
few
days
as
he
supposed
evidence
of
the
distressed
state
of
the
garrison
was
forthcoming
on
july
when
martinez
turned
out
of
the
fortress
without
any
demand
for
exchange
french
and
italian
prisoners
who
had
been
confined
in
the
since
the
commencement
of
the
siege
they
were
in
a
condition
and
reported
that
for
some
days
they
had
hardly
received
any
food
at
all
general
guillot
and
the
officers
were
not
released
they
were
useful
hostages
since
their
lives
were
at
the
disposition
of
the
governor
in
case
the
french
should
threaten
to
refuse
quarter
to
irregulars
or
make
other
harsh
demands
when
the
inevitable
surrender
should
draw
nearer
see
vacani
it
will
be
remembered
that
when
masséna
was
in
a
similar
position
at
genoa
in
be
refused
to
dismiss
his
austrian
prisoners
and
allowed
many
hundreds
of
them
to
die
of
starvation
martinez
was
more
merciful
the
expectation
that
martinez
would
hoist
the
white
flag
within
a
few
days
of
the
release
of
the
prisoners
was
entirely
falsified
he
held
out
suffering
terrible
privations
for
another
month
he
was
aware
that
tarragona
had
fallen
that
campoverde
s
army
had
gone
to
pieces
and
that
he
had
no
hope
of
succour
but
he
rightly
considered
that
it
was
his
duty
to
detain
the
corps
before
his
walls
to
the
last
possible
moment
meanwhile
he
kept
up
the
spirits
of
his
garrison
as
best
he
could
by
assuring
them
that
it
was
well
within
their
power
to
break
out
through
the
adversary
s
lines
by
a
general
sortie
when
the
last
rations
should
have
been
issued
by
august
this
moment
had
arrived
the
spaniards
had
eaten
not
only
the
few
horses
in
the
place
but
the
dogs
and
rats
only
three
days
were
left
the
plan
for
the
evasion
was
well
designed
in
the
afternoon
rovira
who
had
returned
with
empty
hands
from
cadiz
showed
himself
on
the
hills
nearest
to
figueras
with
some
all
that
could
be
collected
he
made
roving
demonstrations
against
the
north
side
of
the
french
circumvallation
in
the
hope
of
drawing
the
reserves
in
that
direction
but
allowed
himself
to
be
driven
away
without
serious
resistance
after
dark
however
martinez
sallied
from
the
fortress
on
the
opposite
side
the
in
the
direction
of
the
sea
hoping
to
find
the
line
thin
on
that
front
he
had
brought
with
him
every
man
who
could
march
and
dashed
at
the
circumvallation
in
one
broad
column
the
hostile
pickets
and
outposts
were
rolled
in
but
the
spaniards
were
brought
up
against
an
impassable
while
two
batteries
on
each
side
began
playing
against
the
flanks
of
the
mass
after
vainly
trying
to
break
through
for
some
minutes
they
recoiled
into
the
fortress
leaving
dead
and
wounded
behind
them

martinez
aware
that

agreed
to
surrender
on

day
that
following
the
issue
of

in

the

crawled
out
and

it

able
to
stand

had
suffered
almost
as
heavily

many
more
from

macdonald
sought
eagerly
among
the
prisoners
for
the
three
young
catalans
who
had
let
their
compatriots
into
san
fernando
the
two
brothers

but
the
third
juan

was
found
and
hanged
on
a
high
gallows
on
the
ravelin
of
the
fortress
they
both
became
officers
in
the
catalan
army
and
survived
for
many
years
after
the
war
the
elder
died
a
retired
in
the
year
see
arteche
x
vacani
and
napier
err
in
saying
that
he
was
hanged
with
marquez
who
was
his
cousin
thus
ended
in
disaster
the
story
of
figueras
but
both
the
capture
of
the
place
and
its
defence
form
a
most
honourable
page
in
the
history
of
the
war
rovira
s
enterprise
in
seizing
it
and
martinez
s
obstinacy
in
maintaining
it
long
after
all
hope
was
gone
were
equally
praiseworthy
though
nothing
came
of
the
exploit
in
the
end
they
had
immobilized
the
whole
french
corps
for
the
entire
summer
of
and
had
prevented
macdonald
from
giving
a
single
battalion
to
help
suchet
s
attack
on
tarragona
if
campoverde
had
possessed
the
most
ordinary
capacity
or
resolution
he
might
have
turned
the
opportunity
given
him
by
the
chiefs
to
such
good
account
as
to
wreck
all
the
campaign
planned
by
napoleon
for
the
subjection
of
catalonia
better
management
on
may
might
have
led
to
the
defeat
of
baraguay
d
hilliers
and
if
he
had
been
driven
off
from
figueras
and
isolated
from
macdonald
who
was
then
far
away
at
barcelona
suchet
would
have
had
to
march
to
the
help
of
his
comrades
and
the
siege
of
tarragona
could
never
have
begun
we
are
brought
back
to
the
point
which
has
already
so
often
confronted
us
campoverde
s
miserable
inefficiency
was
the
final
cause
of
all
the
disasters
of
in
the
principality
of
which
he
was
the
illustration
catalonia
two
such
blows
as
the
fall
of
tarragona
and
the
recapture
of
figueras
seemed
to
render
inevitable
the
final
subjection
of
catalonia
it
is
with
astonishment
that
we
find
that
its
obstinate
people
maintained
their
resistance
for
two
years
more
and
were
found
still
defending
themselves
when
the
war
came
to
an
end
with
the
abdication
of
napoleon
in
the
new
lacy
was
a
man
harsh
and
unpopular
but
he
had
at
least
the
merit
of
energy
his
army
was
a
mere
wreck
but
he
issued
orders
for
a
general
levy
of
all
men
between
and
to
fill
the
depleted
cadres
of
the
few
surviving
regular
battalions
and
despite
the
of
the
junta
who
wished
to
lean
more
on
the
miqueletes
and
distrusted
the
old
army
he
gradually
collected
a
new
force
early
in
august
as
if
in
bravado
he
burst
into
france
on
the
side
of
puigcerda
and
executed
a
destructive
raid
along
the
valleys
of
cerdagne
if
he
was
not
strong
enough
to
help
figueras
or
to
oppose
suchet
he
was
at
least
determined
to
do
all
the
harm
that
he
could
to
the
enemy
this
incursion
threw
napoleon
into
a
fit
of
rage
and
forgetting
his
own
orders
to
suchet
which
prescribed
the
invasion
of
valencia
as
the
next
decisive
move
in
the
war
he
wrote
him
an
angry
dispatch
on
august
in
which
he
told
the
newly
appointed
marshal
that
he
ought
to
have
left
a
strong
french
division
at
vich
and
to
have
marched
with
his
main
body
against
the
catalonian
inland
aiming
at
cardona
and
urgel
and
the
other
unsubdued
places
he
should
have
profited
by
the
panic
into
which
the
spaniards
had
been
thrown
and
might
have
terminated
the
war
in
the
province
while
by
making
his
retrogression
to
saragossa
he
has
given
the
enemy
the
chance
of
rallying
on
all
it
is
sufficient
answer
to
this
accusation
to
say
that
if
the
marshal
had
thrown
all
his
available
troops
into
the
catalan
mountains
he
would
have
become
involved
in
a
series
of
endless
marches
and
after
an
intangible
enemy
which
would
have
prevented
him
from
carrying
out
in
the
autumn
his
great
and
successful
attack
on
valencia
the
strength
of
the
catalan
resistance
did
not
lie
in
the
possession
of
cardona
or
urgel
or
any
other
stronghold
but
in
the
determination
of
its
people
not
to
lay
down
their
arms
there
is
no
probability
that
the
war
could
have
been
terminated
in
the
way
that
the
emperor
hoped
vol

no
by

lacy
had
reorganized
the
remnants
of

milans
and

each
containing
only
four
or
five

every

of
the

the

aided
by

he
drove
the
french
out
of
the
medas
islands
at
the
mouth
of
the
ter
and
built
on
the
largest
of
them
a
fort
which
gave
him
a
secure
point
of
communication
with
the
mediterranean
squadron
but
this
was
a
in

he
accomplished
something
far
more
important
descending
on
the
line
of
garrisons
by
which
the
french
kept
open
the
road
from
barcelona
to
lerida
he
took
men
at

on

captured
a
large
convoy
near

took
that
town
with

and
the
neighbouring
belpuig
with

on

the
chain
of

broken
and
to
the
intense
joy
of

later
macdonald
was
recalled
to

october
he
was
the
third
marshal
whose
reputation
got
no
profit
from
his
catalonian
campaign
his
failure
was
as
bad
as
that
of
augereau
and
he
had
not

got

small
credit
that

when
marmont
before
the
end
of
the
second
week
of
july
had
taken
his
departure
from
the
valley
of
the
guadiana
and
had
begun
to
disperse
his
army
in
cantonments
on
both
sides
of
the
tagus
wellington
was
able
to
review
his
own
situation
at
leisure
and
to
think
out
a
new
plan
of
operations
the
army
of
portugal
had
settled
down
in
a
central
position
from
which
it
could
transfer
itself
with
equal
facility
to
reinforce
the
corps
in
estremadura
if
the
allies
should
make
another
move
against
badajoz
or
the
troops
of
dorsenne
in
the
kingdom
of
leon
if
any
attempt
were
made
to
strike
at
ciudad
rodrigo
and
salamanca
marmont
had
placed
one
division
foy
s
and
a
cavalry
brigade
at
truxillo
to
keep
up
the
communication
across
the
mountains
with
the
corps
he
had
established
his
own
head
quarters
at
navalmoral
near
almaraz
and
had
three
divisions
in
his
immediate
neighbourhood
along
the
tagus
the
remaining
two
which
completed
his
army
were
placed
one
at
plasencia
the
other
in
the
province
of
avila
somewhat
more
to
the
north
so
as
to
command
the
passes
into
the
kingdom
of
leon
by
which
the
army
would
have
to
move
to
join
the
army
of
the
north
supposing
that
wellington
took
the
offensive
on
the
agueda
and
the
tormes
in
this
position
the
marshal
remained
in
an
expectant
attitude
for
some
ten
weeks
the
period
of
repose
was
very
grateful
to
him
since
he
had
taken
his
army
to
the
relief
of
badajoz
in
haste
before
it
was
fully
reorganized
and
was
anxiously
expecting
the
arrival
of
the
drafts
and
convalescents
whom
he
had
left
behind
him
and
what
was
still
more
important
a
great
supply
of
remounts
to
strengthen
his
depleted
cavalry
and
of
gun
teams
to
bring
his
batteries
up
to
the
total
of
eighty
pieces
which
had
been
prescribed
by
the
emperor
as
his
proper
complement
he
was
aware
that
orders
had
been
issued
from
paris
that
the
army
of
the
north
was
to
make
over
to
him
artillery
horses
and
that
nearly
a
thousand
cavalry
were
coming
from
bayonne
whither
the
and
squadrons
of
each
of
his
dragoon
regiments
had
been
sent
back
in
may
to
pick
up
new
chargers
general
vandermaesen
as
he
was
informed
by
a
dispatch
from
berthier
dated
july
was
to
be
at
burgos
by
august
with
remounted
dragoons
artillery
horses
and
drafts
and
recruits
for
the
infantry
but
as
so
often
happened
in
spain
this
great
reinforcement
had
not
turned
up
even
by
the
middle
of
september
for
though
the
troops
had
started
from
bayonne
great
numbers
of
them
were
detained
on
the
way
not
only
by
dorsenne
but
by
mere
and
chiefs
of
small
garrisons
who
presumed
to
lay
hands
on
them
because
they
thought
themselves
threatened
by
some
movement
of
the
navarrese
or
cantabrian
guerrilleros
vandermaesen
got
to
burgos
but
could
not
collect
more
than
half
of
the
column
which
he
was
directed
to
take
to
the
army
of
portugal
and
so
did
not
start
the
divisions
in
the
field
received
no
appreciable
reinforcements
till
september
was
far
advanced
meanwhile
marmont
used
the
troops
which
lay
immediately
round
his
head
quarters
to
construct
an
important
group
of
permanent
fortifications
about
almaraz
the
chief
passage
of
the
tagus
the
there
was
replaced
by
a
strong
bridge
of
boats
protected
at
each
end
by
a
closed
work
partly
in
stone
partly
in
earth
the
one
was
called
fort
ragusa
the
other
fort
napoleon
in
addition
the
defile
in
the
mountains
by
which
the
road
descends
on
to
almaraz
was
protected
by
a
third
structure
called
fort
mirabete
from
the
neighbouring
village
this
group
of
works
gave
the
french
a
stronger
hold
on
the
central
tagus
than
they
had
ever
possessed
before
and
the
permanent
bridge
was
invaluable
since
it
permitted
troops
to
go
south
or
north
at
a
much
greater
rate
than
had
been
possible
when
as
hitherto
they
had
to
be
ferried
over
on
a
mere
pontoon
worked
with
ropes
orders
came
from
paris
that
a
similar
passage
protected
by
a
fortified
post
was
to
be
established
at
alcantara
sixty
miles
further
down
the
river
where
the
broken
roman
bridge
invited
repair
but
this
was
quite
beyond
marmont
s
power
the
position
was
far
too
near
the
portuguese
border
to
be
maintained
save
by
a
large
garrison
which
would
have
required
revictualling
at
frequent
intervals
for
the
neighbouring
region
always
desolate
was
now
absolutely
depeopled
when
wellington
had
large
bodies
of
troops
at
castello
branco
and
portalegre
while
there
was
no
solid
force
of
the
army
of
portugal
nearer
than
navalmoral
it
would
have
been
too
risky
to
expose
a
detachment
at
alcantara
the
ruined
remains
of
the
mediaeval
fortress
there
which
had
been
knocked
to
pieces
in
the
old
war
of
the
spanish
succession
could
not
have
been
patched
up
so
as
to
resist
artillery
of
the
lightest
sort
these
divisions
were
those
of

and

for
an
interesting
account
of
the
experiences
of
an
officer
sent
to
scrape
together
drafts
and
convalescents
despite
of
the
petty
governors
see
the
diary
of
sprünglin
pp
he
had
special
difficulties
with
thiébault
the
governor
of
salamanca
correspondence
from
berthier
printed
in
marmont
s
iv
marmont
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
maintaining
his
army
in
the
region
which
it
now
occupied
the
western
part
of
the
kingdom
of
new
castile
was
as
wellington
had
found
in
the
talavera
campaign
almost
incapable
of
feeding
a
large
force
the
vera
of
plasencia
was
the
only
district
which
sufficed
for
itself
even
in
time
of
peace
normally
food
would
have
been
drawn
from
the
direction
of
toledo
aranjuez
and
madrid
but
this
district
was
in
the
occupation
of
the
army
of
the
centre
and
king
joseph
protested
in
the
most
lively
fashion
at
being
expected
to
furnish
all
the
supplies
for
marmont
s
force
over
which
he
was
denied
control
and
with
which
he
seems
to
have
felt
himself
little
concerned
new
castile
barely
sufficed
for
his
own
needs
and
when
an
imperial
decree
proclaimed
that
the
districts
of
toledo
avila
and
talavera
were
removed
from
his
sphere
of
command
and
placed
at
the
disposition
of
the
army
of
portugal
he
considered
that
his
brother
had
broken
the
pledges
which
had
been
made
to
him
during
his
short
visit
to
paris
for
in
this
bargain
it
had
been
stipulated
that
armies
entering
his
sphere
of
activity
came
under
his
command
before
evacuating
the
ceded
districts
he
withdrew
all
the
movable
stores
and
munitions
marmont
declares
that
at
toledo
the
royal
officials
sold
all
the
corn
in
the
magazines
to
private
persons
just
before
the
arrival
of
his
own
commissaries
and
handed
over
empty
vaults
to
the
see
joseph
to
marmont
in
the
correspondence
of
the
latter

pp
see
above
marmont
s
iv
even
with
the
resources
of
the
provinces
of
avila
and
toledo
at
its
disposition
the
army
of
portugal
only
lived
from
hand
to
mouth
and
was
unable
to
accumulate
magazines
of
any
importance
the
transport
of
the
was
the
great
problem
the
army
had
practically
no
vehicles
left
as
marmont
observed
in
one
of
his
dispatches
to
berthier
he
had
received
over
from
masséna
about
ten
waggons
only
all
the
rest
that
had
belonged
to
the
three
corps
that
had
marched
into
portugal
had
been
left
behind
on
the
mountain
roads
between
santarem
and
sabugal
in
march
country
carts
might
have
been
requisitioned
in
the
valley
of
the
tagus
at
an
early
stage
of
the
war
but
by
they
had
entirely
disappeared
along
with
the
oxen
that
had
drawn
them
the
population
had
mostly
vanished
and
the
fraction
that
remained
was
in
a
condition
of
abject
misery
from
talavera
as
far
as
the
portuguese
border
marmont
calls
the
country
from
almaraz
to
merida
a
horrible
wilderness
he
calculated
that
the
whole
of
the
region
could
barely
feed
men
and
that
the
rest
of
his
army
only
subsisted
by
drawing
on
the
comparatively
intact
toledo
district
intercepted
dispatch
from
marmont
to
berthier
of
august
printed
in
wellington
xiii
iv
of
all
this
trouble
on
the
part
of
his
immediate
adversary
wellington
was
aware
through
intercepted
dispatches
as
well
as
through
the
reports
sent
in
to
him
by
the
spaniards
and
the
facts
that
marmont
had
been
forced
to
disperse
his
army
into
cantonments
extending
from
truxillo
to
avila
and
had
no
magazines
of
any
size
formed
important
data
in
his
calculations
it
would
clearly
take
many
days
to
assemble
the
whole
army
of
portugal
whether
it
were
required
on
the
guadiana
or
on
the
tormes
at
the
same
time
marmont
by
his
march
in
june
to
join
soult
had
shown
himself
a
general
of
energy
and
decision
and
it
must
be
taken
for
granted
that
if
there
was
good
reason
for
him
to
move
he
would
do
so
as
quickly
as
the
difficulties
of
supply
would
permit
him
his
force
which
wellington
very
accurately
calculated
at
about
infantry
and
horse
or
some
men
of
all
arms
was
the
central
fact
in
all
future
operations
clearly
it
would
be
moved
south
or
north
whenever
necessary
see
wellington
to
lord
liverpool
vii
as
to
soult
he
had
now
so
much
on
his
hands
in
andalusia
that
he
was
not
to
be
feared
for
the
present
it
was
known
that
he
had
left
nothing
in
estremadura
save
the
corps
now
under
drouet
and
five
or
six
regiments
of
dragoons
the
troops
drawn
from
cordova
and
granada
had
been
taken
back
to
andalusia
but
two
divisions
were
hunting
blake
and
ballasteros
in
the
condado
de
niebla
the
disposable
remainder
must
be
very
small
soult
therefore
might
be
neglected
as
an
enemy
capable
of
taking
the
offensive
if
however
the
army
were
to
invade
andalusia
an
operation
which
some
of
wellington
s
subordinates
had
suggested
to
him
as
a
possibility
the
duke
of
dalmatia
would
certainly
raise
the
siege
of
cadiz
probably
abandon
granada
and
march
against
the
allies
with
a
force
which
including
the
corps
would
be
strong
wherefore
offensive
action
in
this
quarter
could
not
be
thought
of
all
the
more
so
because
marmont
if
nothing
was
left
opposite
him
on
the
tagus
might
come
down
by
merida
threaten
elvas
and
abrantes
and
perhaps
take
the
allies
in
the
rear
after
they
had
crossed
the
sierra
morena
d
urban
in
his
diary
often
harps
upon
this
project
we
should
meet
in
andalusia
the
whole
force
which
lately
obliged
us
to
raise
the
siege
of
badajoz
with
the
addition
to
it
of
the
force
which
was
left
before
cadiz
an
attempt
to
relieve
cadiz
would
certainly
not
vii
nor
was
the
idea
of
renewing
the
siege
of
badajoz
during
soult
s
absence
tempting
the
place
could
certainly
be
beset
but
in
ten
days
or
so
marmont
and
the
men
of
the
corps
would
have
united
to
relieve
it
and
their
joint
force
would
be
nearly
equal
in
total
numbers
to
the
and
superior
to
them
in
cavalry
any
success
which
we
might
derive
from
a
general
action
to
which
i
might
bring
the
army
of
portugal
and
the
corps
would
not
be
very
decisive
on
the
other
hand
the
loss
which
we
would
sustain
by
the
heat
of
the
weather
and
by
the
length
of
the
marches
which
we
should
be
obliged
to
make
would
be
very
great
but
the
main
objection
to
a
renewal
of
the
siege
of
badajoz
was
not
the
prospect
of
a
pitched
battle
but
the
impossibility
of
sitting
down
to
a
leaguer
in
the
valley
of
the
guadiana
at
a
time
when
it
was
known
to
be
absolutely
pestilential
already
on
the
caya
the
army
had
begun
to
suffer
from
the
guadiana
fever
and
its
spread
had
only
been
stopped
by
moving
the
troops
back
to
the
healthy
towns
in
the
highlands
from
the
same
letter
to
lord
liverpool
vii
wellington
therefore
ruled
out
of
the
list
of
possible
operations
any
movement
to
the
south
of
the
tagus
there
remained
only
the
chance
of
making
another
attempt
on
ciudad
rodrigo
and
from
the
end
of
july
onward
this
was
the
project
which
was
engrossing
his
attention
to
make
a
move
in
this
direction
would
certainly
draw
marmont
from
the
tagus
and
cause
him
to
unite
with
the
army
of
the
north
for
the
relief
of
the
fortress
but
wellington
thought
that
he
would
prefer
this
combination
among
his
enemies
to
the
other
one
which
would
ensue
if
he
were
to
make
his
stroke
in
estremadura
he
gave
three
reasons
to
lord
liverpool
for
the
preference
the
first
was
that
in
a
campaign
on
the
frontiers
of
leon
he
would
have
the
assistance
of
all
the
militia
of
northern
portugal
for
subsidiary
operations
the
second
was
that
the
ground
would
be
much
more
in
his
favour
he
would
have
behind
him
not
the
broad
plains
of
the
alemtejo
but
the
rugged
spurs
of
the
serra
da
estrella
where
strong
positions
abounded
and
where
the
numerous
french
cavalry
would
be
as
useless
as
they
had
proved
during
the
campaign
of
bussaco
in
the
preceding
year
the
third
advantage
was
that
to
draw
marmont
into
leon
separated
him
from
soult
by
the
whole
breadth
of
central
spain
and
disconnected
the
operations
of
the
two
main
french
forces
for
the
army
of
the
north
was
a
less
formidable
body
than
the
army
of
andalusia
because
it
was
scattered
over
an
even
greater
extent
of
territory
nor
were
its
distractions
less
than
those
of
soult
the
galicians
and
asturians
longa
porlier
and
mina
and
all
the
guerrilleros
of
old
castile
were
in
existence
to
keep
this
french
force
constantly
harassed
in
their
way
they
were
more
effective
as
irritants
than
blake
ballasteros
and
the
murcians
had
proved
to
be
in
the
south
see
the
dispatch
of
july
in
which
these
three
points
are
set
forth
vii
wellington
was
not
at
this
moment
the
end
of
july
aware
that
the
army
of
the
north
was
about
to
receive
reinforcements
which
would
make
it
far
more
formidable
in
the
autumn
he
could
not
yet
know
that
the
divisions
of
souham
reille
and
caffarelli
were
about
to
be
thrown
across
the
pyrenees
and
that
the
first
of
them
would
be
in
the
front
line
during
the
operations
of
september
even
by
august
he
was
only
aware
in
a
vague
fashion
that
more
french
troops
were
expected
at
vittoria
from
bayonne
and
supposed
them
to
be
about
or
strong
while
they
were
really
three
full
divisions
of
over
men
by
the
end
of
the
month
he
was
better
informed
but
by
that
time
his
operations
had
begun
and
it
was
too
late
to
make
a
change
vii
i
should
imagine
that
the
reports
have
some
august
vii
august
by
august
he
has
heard
that
the
léger
and
other
new
regiments
from
the
interior
of
france
are
over
the
pyrenees
vii
even
from
the
first
however
wellington
was
disposed
to
believe
that
no
great
results
would
follow
from
a
move
against
ciudad
rodrigo
i
am
tempted
to
try
this
enterprise
he
wrote
to
lord
liverpool
before
he
had
begun
his
march
but
i
beg
your
lordship
to
observe
that
i
may
be
obliged
to
abandon
it
when
the
relative
force
of
the
two
armies
will
be
so
nearly
balanced
as
in
this
and
particularly
in
an
operation
in
the
peninsula
of
spain
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
foresee
all
the
events
which
may
lead
to
this
result
but
the
arrival
of
reinforcements
to
the
enemy
or
further
information
which
may
show
them
to
be
stronger
than
i
now
imagine
or
a
falling
off
in
the
strength
of
our
army
owing
to
sickness
would
necessarily
oblige
me
to
abandon
the
enterprise
later
comments
are
in
the
same
cautious
tone
on
august
wellington
thinks
it
more
than
ever
doubtful
whether
he
will
be
in
a
situation
to
undertake
the
siege
of
ciudad
rodrigo
but
the
movement
may
afford
an
opportunity
of
striking
an
advantageous
blow
and
cause
the
enemy
at
least
to
draw
off
troops
from
corners
of
the
peninsula
where
they
are
badly
wanted
vii
july
long
before
the
army
began
to
move
towards
the
agueda
and
the
frontiers
of
leon
wellington
had
given
the
preliminary
order
which
committed
him
to
the
project
of
attacking
rodrigo
he
had
at
last
received
from
england
the
heavy
of
siege
artillery
which
would
have
been
invaluable
in
may
for
the
breaching
of
badajoz
it
was
on
shipboard
in
lisbon
harbour
he
directed
it
to
be
taken
round
by
sea
to
oporto
sent
up
the
douro
in
boats
as
far
as
lamego
where
lay
the
limit
of
river
navigation
and
then
to
be
sent
forward
by
detachments
to
trancoso
in
the
northern
beira
where
he
intended
to
establish
his
base
dépôt
nearly
pairs
of
draught
bullocks
and
about
country
carts
were
to
be
collected
at
lamego
for
the
transport
the
charge
of
the
whole
operation
was
given
to
alexander
dickson
whose
energetic
management
of
the
very
inefficient
siege
artillery
at
badajoz
had
inspired
wellington
with
a
strong
belief
in
his
resourcefulness
and
his
power
of
getting
the
largest
possible
amount
of
work
out
of
the
portuguese
military
and
civilians
alike
it
is
contained
in
the
memorandum
for
colonels
frampton
and
fletcher
of
july
dated
the
day
after
the
dispatch
to
lord
liverpool
which
sets
forth
the
whole
project
dickson
started
at
once
for
oporto
where
he
found
two
companies
of
british
artillery
which
had
been
sent
from
lisbon
and
picked
up
somewhat
later
portuguese
gunners
who
were
also
placed
at
his
disposition
with
their
aid
he
began
shipping
up
to
lamego
the
guns
and
ammunition
from
the
transports
so
long
as
the
transport
was
by
water
matters
went
slowly
but
easily
but
the
land
voyage
from
lamego
onwards
turned
out
a
business
from
the
badness
of
the
roads
and
the
difficulty
of
collecting
cattle
for
draught
dickson
prevailed
upon
wellington
in
the
end
to
make
villa
da
ponte
rather
than
trancoso
his
central
dépôt
the
town
in
the
hills
proving
less
convenient
than
the
large
village
fifteen
miles
further
north
all
through
august
and
september
material
was
accumulating
at
villa
da
ponte
but
it
was
never
sent
forward
because
as
the
campaign
worked
out
no
regular
siege
of
ciudad
rodrigo
ever
became
possible
wellington
would
not
show
his
until
it
was
certain
that
he
could
turn
it
to
good
use
and
kept
it
hidden
far
to
the
rear
of
his
it
was
only
gradually
that
part
of
it
began
to
be
moved
up
to
almeida
ostensibly
to
serve
for
the
of
that
fortress
where
the
damage
done
by
the
two
explosions
carried
out
by
brennier
and
pack
had
been
repaired
it
was
not
to
be
till
december
that
the
guns
landed
at
oporto
in
august
were
employed
but
all
through
the
autumn
wellington
s
movements
were
greatly
influenced
by
the
fact
that
he
had
now
a
large
and
efficient
ready
in
a
position
from
which
it
could
be
sent
forward
the
moment
that
a
fair
opportunity
should
offer
itself
it
was
the
existence
of
dickson
s
park
at
villa
da
ponte
as
much
or
more
than
any
other
factor
in
the
situation
that
kept
wellington
on
the
frontiers
of
leon
watching
for
his
chance
it
would
seem
that
his
caution
was
justified
the
french
never
quite
realized
that
he
was
ready
to
attack
rodrigo
in
the
most
effective
style
when
they
should
give
him
the
opportunity
that
he
lacked
by
dispersing
their
armies
in
a
way
which
rendered
rapid
concentration
impossible
bredin
s
and
glubb
s
which
had
long
been
lying
at
lisbon
without
horses
and
had
taken
no
part
in
the
field
operations
of
and
holcombe
s
battery
was
soon
afterwards
substituted
for
glubb
s
see
dickson
s
ed
leslie
for
months
of
the
march
of
the
seven
divisions
which
were
destined
for
service
on
the
agueda
and
the
azava
began
in
the
first
week
of
august
the
light
division
and
arentschildt
s
cavalry
moving
up
from
castello
branco
were
at
sabugal
on
the
and
occupied
martiago
beyond
the
agueda
and
close
to
rodrigo
on
the
on
the
following
day
wellington
in
person
led
a
reconnaissance
right
up
to
the
walls
of
the
fortress
and
drove
in
all
the
french
outposts
the
blockade
was
then
established
by
the
light
division
on
the
left
bank
of
the
agueda
and
the
division
on
the
right
the
head
quarters
of
the
former
being
at
carpio
those
of
the
latter
at
martiago
the
road
to
salamanca
was
only
cut
by
means
of
cavalry
posts
and
julian
sanchez
s
guerrilla
bands
and
the
infantry
did
not
approach
within
some
miles
of
rodrigo
wellington
s
purpose
was
merely
to
prevent
the
entry
of
provisions
into
the
place
he
had
no
intention
of
drawing
close
up
to
it
and
opening
a
siege
till
he
should
have
learnt
that
his
should
have
reached
trancoso
and
it
would
obviously
be
a
matter
of
many
weeks
before
the
guns
got
up
from
oporto
it
might
perhaps
be
argued
that
it
would
have
been
better
not
to
demonstrate
at
all
against
rodrigo
or
to
call
the
attention
of
marmont
and
dorsenne
in
this
direction
till
there
was
some
possibility
of
opening
for
to
famish
the
garrison
must
infallibly
lead
to
a
concentration
of
the
enemy
at
salamanca
for
its
relief
and
draw
together
a
large
army
marmont
was
less
dangerous
in
his
scattered
cantonments
about
the
tagus
than
with
his
forces
massed
on
the
tormes
and
there
was
little
hope
of
reducing
rodrigo
by
famine
alone
clearly
the
enemy
would
mass
and
fight
rather
than
allow
it
to
fall
unaided
wellington
saw
this
clearly
enough
he
writes
to
lord
liverpool
on
august
if
we
can
not
maintain
this
blockade
the
enemy
must
bring
men
to
raise
it
and
then
they
can
undertake
nothing
else
this
year
for
they
must
still
continue
to
watch
rodrigo
and
we
shall
so
far
save
the
cause
meanwhile
if
they
offer
me
a
favourable
opportunity
of
bringing
any
of
them
to
action
i
shall
take
viii
meanwhile
wellington
moved
his
head
quarters
to
fuente
guinaldo
sixteen
miles
south
of
ciudad
rodrigo
on
august
and
kept
them
there
till
september
the
divisions
not
engaged
in
the
blockade
were
cantoned
at
various
points
to
the
rear
the
first
division
lay
about
penamacor
it
was
no
longer
commanded
by
spencer
who
had
so
long
led
it
he
had
gone
home
ostensibly
on
sick
leave
really
because
he
was
annoyed
that
general
graham
had
recently
been
ordered
up
from
cadiz
and
was
for
the
future
to
take
charge
of
the
whole
left
wing
of
the
army
whenever
the
was
absent
this
responsibility
had
hitherto
fallen
to
spencer
and
wellington
was
not
alone
in
thinking
that
he
had
not
discharged
it
over
well
the
arrival
of
graham
august
was
welcomed
by
all
ranks
and
for
the
future
he
assumed
charge
nominally
of
the
division
really
of
all
the
troops
in
the
north
which
were
not
actually
under
the
master
s
eye
at
any
rate
graham
could
never
be
accused
of
dullness
of
apprehension
or
indecision
the
two
charges
habitually
made
against
spencer
by
wellington
himself
no
less
than
by
many
diarists
of
the
time
fortescue
sends
me
the
subjoined
note
on
spencer
from
a
suppressed
letter
of
wellington
to
pole
at
apsley
house
not
to
be
found
in
any
of
the
editions
of
the
the
person
who
is
now
here
as
second
in
command
is
very
unfit
for
his
situation
he
is
a
good
executive
officer
but
has
no
mind
and
is
incapable
of
forming
any
opinions
of
his
own
he
is
the
centre
of
all
the
vulgar
and
foolish
opinions
of
the
day
thus
you
are
aware
that
from
former
experiences
i
can
not
depend
upon
him
for
a
moment
for
anything
he
gives
his
opinion
upon
every
subject
changes
it
with
the
wind
and
if
any
misfortune
occurs
or
the
act
recommended
by
him
is
disapproved
of
there
is
no
effort
to
be
looked
for
from
this
verdict
does
not
much
differ
save
in
strength
of
expression
from
the
opinion
of
minor
contemporaries
such
as
tomkinson
and
stepney
sir
brent
spencer
a
zealous
gallant
officer
had
no
great
military
genius
he
was
anxious
and
fidgety
when
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
once
under
fire
looked
like
a
philosopher
solving
a
problem
perfectly
cool
and

a
diary
of
an
officer
of

notes
as
to

s
resentment
at
his
supersession
by
graham
this
has
value
as
the
diarist
was
a
favourite
of
the
general
who
had
offered
to
make
him
his
not
far
off
from
the
division
was
the
under
cole
at
pedrogão
twenty
miles
from
castello
branco
the
division
meanwhile
lay
at
perales
payo
and
navas
frias
watching
the
passes
of
the
sierra
de
gata
in
case
marmont
s
division
at
plasencia
should
make
an
unexpected
forward
movement
towards
leon
by
the
shortest
route
the
division
was
at
villar
mayor
near
sabugal
and
fuente
guinaldo
lastly
the
division
more
to
the
left
and
forming
the
northernmost
section
of
the
army
was
cantoned
between
the
coa
and
the
lower
agueda
from
nava
de
aver
as
far
as
the
bridge
of
barba
del
puerco
of
the
cavalry
alten
s
brigade
was
covering
the
light
and
divisions
in
front
of
ciudad

while
the
others
de
grey
s
slade
s
and
anson
s
were
watching
the
frontier
eastward
from
castello
branco
with
observing
parties
in
the
passes
but
the
main
bodies
placed
some
way
to
the
rear
the
head
quarters
of
the
second
brigade
was
at
soita
near
sabugal
that
of
the
at
idanha
nova
these
cantonments
it
will
be
observed
were
somewhat
scattered
there
being
no
less
than
eighty
miles
between
barba
del
puerco
in
the
north
and
penamacor
in
the
south
but
wellington
calculated
that
he
would
always
have
long
notice
of
any
concentration
of
the
enemy
in
his
front
and
three
marches
would
suffice
to
unite
the
army
on
its
centre
between
fuente
guinaldo
and
alfayates
or
four
to
concentrate
it
on
a
wing
if
the
french
a
thing
not
very
probable
should
show
signs
of
operating
either
south
of
the

on

but
borrowed

and

and
light
dragoons
it
should
be
noted
that
about
this
time
wellington
for
the
first
time
since
obtained
the
assistance
of
a
spanish
force
on
the
beira
frontier
general
castaños
busy
in
reorganizing
the
ruined
army
of
estremadura
sent
carlos
de
españa
with
the
cadres
of
several
infantry
regiments
to
the
frontier
of
leon
to
fill
them
up
with
recruits
from
the
province
of
salamanca
the
rest
of
his
troops
under
morillo
and
penne
villemur
were
kept
in
estremadura
and
continued
to
with
hill
but
carlos
de
españa
fixed
himself
at
ledesma
where
he
joined
hands
with
the
great
partisan
julian
sanchez
and
soon
collected
some
men
who
though
useless
for
action
being
raw
and
not
properly
furnished
with
uniforms
or
arms
yet
served
to
hold
a
position
in
front
of
the
lower
agueda
and
gave
much
trouble
to
thiébault
the
governor
of
salamanca
by
their
sallies
and
incursions
into
his
district
for
whose
actions
see
section
xxix
for
some
weeks
after
the
arrival
of
the
army
on
the
beira
frontier
there
was
little
stirring
the
fact
that
ciudad
rodrigo
had
been
cut
off
from
communication
with
salamanca
did
not
at
first
provoke
the
french
to
action
for
the
place
was
in
no
immediate
danger
of
starvation
a
large
convoy
had
been
thrown
into
the
place
only
two
days
before
the
blockade
was
formed
and
it
was
known
that
the
allied
army
had
no
in
its
company
throughout
the
month
of
august
dorsenne
was
much
more
troubled
by
the
operations
of
the
galicians
than
by
wellington
s
demonstration
while
marmont
knowing
that
rodrigo
was
provisioned
up
to
october
saw
no
reason
for
moving
till
it
should
be
drawing
nearer
to
the
end
of
its
resources
it
was
only
about
the
middle
of
september
that
he
got
tardy
news
that
there
was
a
making
its
way
up
from
oporto
and
that
the
british
divisions
behind
the
agueda
were
making
gabions
and
fascines
he
then
was
stimulated
to
activity
and
concerted
a
junction
with
dorsenne
without
further
delay
of
which
more
hereafter
in
august
he
found
full
occupation
in
the
organization
of
the
provinces
of
new
castile
which
the
emperor
had
handed
over
to
him
and
was
more
worried
by
the
difficulty
of
raising
taxes
and
collecting
magazines
and
by
incessant
wrangles
with
king
joseph
s
officials
than
by
military
difficulties
all
that
he
did
was
to
move
his
head
quarters
to
the
neighbourhood
of
plasencia
and
to
shift
some
of
the
brigades
cantoned
along
the
tagus
to
the
north
of
that
river
in
view
of
the
fact
that
a
march
to
relieve
and
revictual
ciudad
rodrigo
would
ultimately
become
necessary
foy
s
division
was
kept
however
at
truxillo
far
to
the
south
till
the
middle
of
september
in
order
that
touch
might
not
be
lost
with
drouet
and
the
army
of
andalusia
the
marshal
very
rightly
scouted
the
idea
which
some
of
his
subordinates
had
formed
that
wellington
s
appearance
on
the
beira
frontier
might
portend
a
dash
at
salamanca
to
gain
some
further
knowledge
of
the
disposition
of
the
he
sent
out
several
cavalry
reconnaissances
from
plasencia
towards
the
sierra
de
gata
they
found
british
outposts
all
along
the
passes
and
could
not
get
forward
though
one
party
succeeded
in
capturing
a
picket
of
the
light
dragoons
at
san
martin
de
trebejos
near
the
puerto
de
perales
on
august
marmont
to
berthier
in
the
vol
of
his
see
all
the
august
correspondence
of
in
his
iv
pp
on
august
according
to
his
narrative
iv
the
news
that
marmont
was
shifting
troops
northward
towards
the
passes
into
the
kingdom
of
leon
induced
wellington
to
make
a
corresponding
movement
with
his
own
troops
and
on
august
the
and
divisions
were
ordered
to
prepare
to
move
from
penamacor
and
pedrogão
to
the
neighbourhood
of
fuente
guinaldo
close
to
head
quarters
the
notion
that
the
army
of
portugal
would
at
some
not
very
distant
date
march
to
raise
the
blockade
of
rodrigo
was
made
even
more
certain
by
the
capture
of
a
dispatch
in
cipher
from
foy
to
girard
warning
him
that
he
was
under
orders
to
follow
marmont
across
the
tagus
and
abandon
truxillo
but
foy
made
no
move
for
a
fortnight
more
and
wellington
rightly
concluded
that
he
need
be
under
no
apprehension
as
to
the
concentration
of
the
enemy
till
he
had
received
news
that
truxillo
had
been
evacuated
it
was
also
clear
that
marmont
intended
that
dorsenne
should
with
him
and
since
that
general
with
all
the
disposable
troops
of
the
army
of
the
north
was
beyond
astorga
at
the
end
of
august
campaigning
against
the
galicians
there
was
no
need
to
feel
any
alarm
till
this
force
should
be
known
to
have
turned
southward
towards
the
douro
on
the
third
of
september
things
began
to
look
a
little
more
exciting
when
dorsenne
was
reported
to
be
starting
from
astorga
on
his
return
journey
he
made
forced
marches
for
salamanca
where
it
was
known
that
a
convoy
for
the
supply
of
rodrigo
was
being
organized
but
provisions
were
hard
to
collect
in
leon
and
marmont
had
refused
to
begin
his
march
of
concentration
till
it
should
be
certified
to
him
that
dorsenne
was
nearly
ready
and
that
the
convoy
had
been
got
together
graham
s
diary
in
his
by
delavoye
august
september
hence
it
was
not
till
september
that
the
time
of
crisis
began
on
this
day
wellington
received
the
news
that
foy
had
evacuated
truxillo
on
the
and
that
montbrun
s
cavalry
was
crossing
the
sierra
by
the
puerto
de
baños
with
infantry
columns
following
in
its
rear
on
the
previous
day
an
intercepted
letter
informed
him
that
the
salamanca
convoy
was
to
be
ready
on
september
if
dorsenne
had
stopped
in
front
of
the
galicians
or
if
marmont
had
been
moving
with
only
part
of
his
troops
wellington
would
have
prepared
to
fight
a
battle
beyond
the
agueda
but
it
was
clear
from
several
intercepted
dispatches
that
the
armies
of
portugal
and
the
north
were
about
to
unite
in
full
force
and
as
the
british
general
remarked
in
a
letter
which
lapsed
into
unwonted
jocularity
the
devil
is
in
the
french
for
numbers
he
had
got
to
know
that
souham
s
strong
division
had
come
to
the
front
to
join
dorsenne
and
that
the
of
roguet
and
dumoustier
with
their
attendant
cavalry
and
artillery
made
up
men
and
not
as
he
had
hitherto
supposed
it
was
possible
nay
probable
that
the
army
of
the
north
would
put
at
least
men
into
the
field
for
the
combined
movement
now
pending
and
marmont
if
he
came
in
full
force
might
bring
more
it
was
impossible
to
stop
such
a
mass
of
men
in
the
plain
east
of
rodrigo
where
the
ground
was
all
suited
to
cavalry
operations
and
where
no
good
defensive
positions
were
to
be
found
if
the
enemy
were
determined
to
relieve
the
place
he
could
certainly
accomplish
his
desire
wellington
to
graham
september
viii
to
beresford
viii
this
is
mentioned
in
his
letters
to
henry
wellesley
of
august
and
to
craufurd
of
august
to
henry
wellesley
on
august
cf
to
lord
liverpool
of
same
date
to

viii
wellington
had
a
little
more
than
men
under
his
hand
at
this
moment
the
total
should
have
been
higher
but
all
the
newly
arrived
detachments
had
been
in
the
walcheren
expedition
and
the
heat
of
the
spanish
summer
had
brought
out
the
fever
which
lurked
in
the
bodies
of
the
men
who
had
served
in
that
pestilential
spot
battalions
which
had
landed
at
lisbon
in
june
with
or
men
had
gone
down
to
or
bayonets
in
september
though
the
marches
had
not
been
heavy
nor
had
the
old
peninsular
regiments
escaped
a
touch
of
guadiana
fever
during
their
stay
near
elvas
in
july
wherefore
there
were
no
less
than
sick
in
the
british
army
at
this
moment
and
the
force
present
under
arms
in
the
seven
divisions
on
the
beira
frontier
was
excluding
the
portuguese
only
sabres
and
bayonets
of
the
portuguese
the
seven
infantry
and
two
cavalry
brigades
serving
with
the
main
army
made
up
about
men
more
with
men
wellington
refused
to
offer
battle
beyond
the
agueda
to
the
combined
french
forces
which
might
well
amount
to
men
and
could
not
be
less
than
or
but
he
was
determined
not
to
retire
an
inch
further
from
rodrigo
than
was
necessary
being
convinced
that
the
enemy
could
only
remain
concentrated
for
a
few
days
and
could
have
no
serious
intention
of
invading
portugal
though
he
might
not
be
able
to
fight
in
the
open
plain
he
was
prepared
to
defend
himself
in
the
skirts
of
the
mountains
if
the
french
should
push
out
beyond
rodrigo
here
he
had
two
positions
already
selected
the
first
at
fuente
guinaldo
where
the
rugged
ground
begins
the
second
by
rendo
and
alfayates
in
front
of
sabugal
which
was
far
more
formidable
this
was
the
ground
which
spencer
had
been
told
to
take
up
in
april
when
he
had
been
left
opposite
masséna
during
wellington
s
absence
at
badajoz
the
guinaldo
position
being
less
defensible
by
nature
was
to
be
rendered
strong
by
art
during
its
stay
there
in
september
the
division
sketched
out
an
entrenched
camp
along
the
hills
but
only
two
redoubts
and
some
long
lines
of
trench
had
been
completed
when
the
crisis
came

the
end
of
the

meanwhile
wellington
did
not
intend
to
retire
on
guinaldo
much
less
on
the
position
unless
he
were
forced
to
do
so
he
thought
it
likely
that
marmont
and
dorsenne
would
content
themselves
with
relieving
rodrigo
and
would
push
no
further
wherefore
he
directed
that
picton
and
craufurd
the
generals
in
command
of
the
two
blockading
divisions
should
leave
the
salamanca
road
open
when
the
french
appeared
in
strength
but
should
not
give
back
from
the
immediate
neighbourhood
of
the
fortress
unless
they
were
attacked
in

get
behind

lie
the
villages

five
or
six
miles
south
of
rodrigo
here
they
were
to
stand
and
to
see
what
the
enemy
intended
to
do
probably
they
would
have
to
retreat
no
further
this
disposition
which
was
founded
on
a
false
psychological
estimate
of
the
character
of
marmont
was
to
lead
to
trouble
the
marshal
was
more
enterprising
than
wellington
had
calculated
and
as
affairs
turned
out
it
would
have
been
safer
to
concentrate
the
whole
army
on
the
fuente
guinaldo
position

armies

september
the
advance
of
the
french
for
the
relief
of
ciudad
rodrigo
began
at
last
on
september
when
marmont
brought
all
the
infantry
of
the
army
of
portugal
save
the
single
division
of
foy
across
the
sierra
de
gata
and
appeared
with
his
vanguard
at
tamames
the
little
town
on
the
leonese
side
of
the
mountains
where
del
parque
had
beaten
marchand
in
foy
alone
had
been
left
in
new
castile
with
orders
to
demonstrate
from
his
base
at
plasencia
against
wellington
s
posts
between
castello
branco
and
sabugal
where
as
it
will
be
remembered
the
division
was
lying
placed
on
this
side
for
the
express
purpose
of
warding
off
any
attempt
to
strike
at
the
communications
of
the
allied
army
on
the
day
that
marmont
with
five
divisions
of
infantry
and
montbrun
s
cavalry
began
to
debouch
from
tamames
his
colleague
dorsenne
had
brought
forward
the
disposable
portion
of
the
army
of
the
north
to
san
muñoz
a
long
march
in
front
of
salamanca
and
was
in
easy
touch
with
the
army
of
portugal
dorsenne
had
concentrated
four
divisions
of
infantry
the
two
of
the
imperial
guard
under
roguet
and
dumoustier
souham
s
newly
arrived
battalions
and
the
division
so
long
commanded
by
serras
but
now
under
general
thiébault
the
governor
of
salamanca
which
had
been
lying
about
the
esla
and
the
orbigo
ever
since
he
had
also
with
him
two
brigades
of
cavalry
lepic
s
sabres
of
the
imperial
guard
and
wathier
s
the
two
armies
joined
on
the
and
showed
a
formidable
total
larger
than
that
which
masséna
had
collected
for
the
battle
of
fuentes
de
oñoro
for
marmont
had
brought
foot
and
over
horse
and
dorsenne
a
slightly
larger
contingent
about
infantry
and
sabres
this
heavy
force
of
men
if
artillery
be
reckoned
in
was
as
wellington
had
always
foreseen
more
than
the
army
could
face
for
including
the
division
south
of
the
sierra
de
gata
which
was
protecting
the
southern
communications
of
the
army
wellington
had
with
him
as
we
have
seen
no
more
than
british
and
portuguese
cavalry
about
british
and
portuguese
infantry
or
a
total
strength
including
artillery
of
about
officers
and
men
of
all
arms
the
risk
of
fighting
in
the
open
plain
in
front
of
ciudad
rodrigo
would
clearly
be
too
great
though
by
a
retreat
into
the
portuguese
mountains
it
would
be
possible
to
find
a
position
which
should
compensate
for
the
numerical
deficiency
of
the
allied
army
if
the
french
should
press
forward
it
would
clearly
be
necessary
to
retire
on
to
better
and
wellington
s
ready
eye
had
found
two
successive
positions
as
we
have
already
stated
the
one
at
fuente
guinaldo
on
the
the
other
between
rendo
and
aldea
velha
in
front
of

within

iv
gives
the
total
at

and
nearly

i
imagine
the
real
total
to
have
been
a
little
larger
about
in
all
by
the
returns
of
the
summer
of
the
two
divisions
had
men
serras
s
thiébault
s
men
souham
s
nearly
meanwhile
it
remained
to
be
seen
whether
the
french
with
the
large
force
that
they
had
collected
would
content
themselves
with
throwing
a
new
convoy
into
ciudad
rodrigo
a
thing
that
could
not
be
prevented
or
whether
they
intended
to
press
the
allied
army
hard
and
to
endeavour
to
bring
it
to
action
in
which
case
the
retreat
into
the
hills
would
become
necessary
on
the
morning
of
the
wellington
perfectly
informed
as
to
the
position
of
the
enemy
and
fairly
well
able
to
estimate
their
numbers
wrote
to
charles
stuart
the
french
have
not
yet
appeared
but
i
think
they
will
before
evening
i
shall
have
my
hands
very
full
of
business
for
the
next
three
or
four
days
they
were
to
be
fuller
than
was
convenient
and
partly
by
his
own
fault
wellington
to
charles
stuart
from
fuente
guinaldo
september
viii
on
learning
that
marmont
and
dorsenne
were
at
san
muñoz
with
over
men
wellington
if
he
had
practised
his
accustomed
caution
would
have
concentrated
on
fuente
guinaldo
withdrawing
the
two
divisions
which
lay
close
into
ciudad
rodrigo
the
light
division
at
martiago
the
division
on
the
heights
by
el
bodon
and
pastores
it
would
have
been
sufficient
to
leave
a
cavalry
screen
as
close
to
the
blockaded
fortress
as
was
practicable
but
for
once
he
showed
an
unwonted
tendency
to
take
dangerous
risks
he
did
not
wish
to
fall
back
unless
he
were
pressed
and
he
thought
it
extremely
probable
that
the
enemy
had
no
further
design
than
to
revictual
rodrigo
refusing
to
give
up
valuable
ground
unless
he
were
forced
to
do
so
he
left
craufurd
and
picton
in
their
advanced
positions
all
through
the
and
of
september
he
did
not
call
graham
and
the
and
divisions
in
from
the
left
where
their
present
position
on
the
azava
covered
the
road
to
almeida
and
the
valuable
accumulation
of
artillery
stores
at
villa
da
ponte
nor
did
he
bring
up
the
division
to
his
head
quarters
at
fuente
guinaldo
where
he
lay
for
these
two
days
with
the
division
alone
the
cavalry
at
the
head
of
the
french
column
appeared
in
the
plain
beyond
ciudad
rodrigo
on
the
as
wellington
had
expected
and
communicated
with
the
place
it
was
in
no
way
hindered
as
the
british
cavalry
fell
back
beyond
the
agueda
by
order
and
left
the
salamanca
road
open
on
the
a
very
large
force
was
up
observers
on
the
heights
of
pastores
saw
a
great
mass
of
cavalry
in
the
plain
below
them
and
four
divisions
of
infantry
one
of
which
was
made
out
by
telescopes
to
belong
to
the
imperial
guard
from
its
high
plumes
and
bearskins
it
was
presently
discovered
that
an
even
larger
mass
was
close
behind
encamped
on
the
guadapero
stream
beyond
the
low
hills
which
lie
east
of
ciudad
rodrigo
but
on
this
day
the
enemy
though
he
had
some
cavalry
in
his
front
line
made
no
attempt
to
push
forward
either
against
picton
or
against
craufurd
this
quiescence
on
his
adversary
s
part
evidently
made
wellington
conclude
that
he
need
fear
nothing
that
the
french
had
come
merely
to
revictual
their
garrison
not
to
take
the
offensive
against
the
allied
army
he
left
his
divisions
in
the
scattered
posts
which
they
were
occupying
with
sixteen
miles
between
graham
on
the
left
and
craufurd
on
the
right
and
he
neglected
the
fact
that
his
concentration
point
at
fuente
guinaldo
was
only
fifteen
miles
from
ciudad
rodrigo
where
the
leading
section
of
the
french
army
over
strong
as
he
had
seen
was
already
encamped
if
it
should
march
suddenly
forward
on
the
the
division
was
only
five
miles
from
its
outposts
on
the
heights
of
pastores
and
el
bodon

there
was
no
other
division
save
the
placed
directly
to
cover
fuente
guinaldo
if
the
flank
divisions
were
called
in
on
an
alarm
graham
was
fifteen
miles
from
fuente
guinaldo
craufurd
eleven
on
the
other
side
of
a
river
with
few
fords
and
by
the
time
that
they
could
concentrate
the
french
van
might
be
supported
by
the
large
reserves
which
were
known
to
be
lying
behind
ciudad
rodrigo
it
is
one
of
the
axioms
of
war
that
the
concentration
point
of
a
scattered
army
must
not
be
within
one
short
march
of
the
base
from
which
the
opponent
can
strike
according
to
marmont
iv
only
one
division
thiébault
s
actually
entered
the
town
wellington
was
so
far
right
in
his
judgement
of
the
enemy
s
designs
that
it
was
true
that
marmont
had
come
forward
without
any
definite
intention
of
forcing
on
a
fight
or
of
advancing
far
into
portugal
his
subsequent
offensive
move
however
was
provoked
by
his
discovery
that
the
allied
army
was
quite
close
to
him
but
wholly
unconcentrated
on
the
morning
of
the
it
occurred
to
the
marshal
that
it
would
be
desirable
to
find
out
by
reconnaissance
whether
wellington
had
been
making
any
provision
for
a
regular
siege
of
ciudad
rodrigo
whether
he
had
been
collecting
fascines
and
gabions
in
the
neighbouring
villages
or
had
brought
up
heavy
artillery
close
to
his
blockading
line
if
this
should
turn
out
to
be
the
case
the
knowledge
of
it
would
have
a
serious
effect
on
all
the
future
movements
of
the
army
of
portugal
for
a
siege
is
a
different
thing
from
a
blockade
and
if
rodrigo
were
in
danger
of
actual
leaguer
his
own
army
would
have
to
canton
itself
in
regions
less
remote
from
the
portuguese
frontier
than
those
which
it
had
hitherto
occupied
this
reason
for
his
great
reconnaissances

persuaded
to
assist
the
army

in
a
great
reconnaissance
which
was
to
push
back
wellington
s
cavalry
screen
and
see
what
lay
behind
it
in
the
morning
of
september
the
two
cavalry
brigades
of
the
army
of
the
north
went
out
on
the
roads
to
sweep
the
line
of
the
azava
with
wathier
in
command
at
the
same
time
montbrun
took
the
bulk
of
the
cavalry
of
marmont
two
brigades
of
dragoons
and
two
of
light
horse
and
advanced
along
the
southern
road

which
runs
from

past
el

towards
fuente

only
one
infantry
division
that
of

the

in

was
put
under

to
support
the
cavalry
and
even
these
men
did
not
leave
the
immediate
vicinity
of
ciudad
rodrigo
they
merely
crossed
the
agueda
and
halted
the
two
reconnaissances
brought
on
two
separate
engagements
at
a
distance
of
ten
miles
from
each
other
of
which
one
had
no
importance
immediate
or
ulterior
while
the
other
led
to
sharp
fighting
and
revealed
to
the
french
the
weakness
of
wellington
s
position
the
cavalry
screen
of
the
allied
army
was
formed
as
follows
madden

portuguese
division
lay
along
the
line
of
the
lower
agueda
which
was
not
threatened
this
day
anson

held
the
line
of
the
azava
and
lay
across
the
carpio
road
alten
s
brigade
was
strung
out
along
the
low
hills
from
south
of
carpio
to
the
upper
agueda
near
pastores
and
had
one
of
its
squadrons
detached
with
the
light
division
beyond
that
river
in

of
martiago
slade

and
de

were
far
to
the

behind

in
villar
de

and
other
villages
along

and
only
came
up
to
the
front
after
midday
on
the
wathier
s
insignificant
engagement
on
the
lower
azava
may
be
dealt
with
first
about
eight
in
the
morning
the
pickets
of
the
light
dragoons
detected
a
strong
column
of
cavalry
coming
out
of
rodrigo
and
were
forced
to
retire
from
carpio
and
other
posts
beyond
the
stream
the
enemy
could
be
counted
from
the
hills
above
and
it
was
noted
that
they
left
six
squadrons
beside
carpio
in
reserve
and
were
advancing
with
eight
more
these
crossed
the
river
and
felt
their
way
cautiously
towards
the
heights
they
were
coming
straight
against
the
front
of
the
division
and
graham
sent
out
the
light
companies
of
hulse
s
brigade
to
line
the
wood
which
covered
the
position
which
he
was
holding
the
two
british
cavalry
regiments
and
light
dragoons
gave
back
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
also
and
formed
up
close
to
their
infantry
supports
misliking
the
look
of
the
long
belt
of
trees
which
hid
all
from
him
wathier
halted
four
squadrons
more
on
the
flat
ground
just
beyond
the
azava
and
moved
the
other
four
towards
graham
s
unseen
line
this
advanced
guard
consisted
of
the
lancers
of
berg
and
the
when
they
were
feeling
their
way
up
the
slope
their
leading
squadron
was
charged
and
driven
back
by
a
squadron
of
the
the
main
body
however
picked
up
the
beaten
unit
and
advanced
again
when
they
had
got
close
to
the
wood
the
light
companies
of
the
and
fired
a
volley
into
them
and
while
they
stood
staggered
by
the
unexpected
salute
four
squadrons
of
the
and
charged
them
broke
them
and
chased
them
for
two
miles
down
to
and
across
the
azava
the
french
reserve
left
close
to
that
stream
retired
at
once
covering
the
broken
squadrons
the
french
lost
one
officer
and
ten
men
killed
and
five
officers
and
men
taken
mostly
wounded
the
british
loss
was
very
small
an
officer
and
ten
men
wounded
and
one
man
missing
this
was
the
first
time
on
which
the
british
cavalry
fought
lancers
at
albuera
it
was
only
infantry
which
were
charged
by
the
poles
tomkinson
of
the
reports
they
looked
well
and
formidable
till
they
were
broken
and
closed
with
by
our
men
and
then
their
lances
were
an
encumbrance
many
caught
in
the
appointments
of
other
men
and
pulled
them
to
the
wathier
stayed
in
line
at
carpio
without
making
a
further
advance
till
evening
and
reported
that
the
english
were
in
position
with
all
arms
beyond
the
azava
and
not
inclined
to
give
way
this
was
important
news
for
if
there
were
infantry
so
far
north
it
was
clear
that
wellington
had
not
yet
concentrated
his
army
on
the
fuente
guinaldo
line
montbrun
s
reconnaissance
along
the
fuente
guinaldo
road
turned
out
a
much
more
lively
and
important
affair
he
started
out
with
a
heavy
column
consisting
of
two
brigades
of
his
own
dragoons
and
two
of
light
cavalry
which
came
into
touch
with
the
vedettes
of
alten
s
brigade
almost
the
moment
that
it
had
crossed
the
agueda
for
the
british
outposts
lay
within
two
miles
of
rodrigo
driving
straight
before
him
montbrun
pierced
the
screen
and
pressing
up
the
slope
found
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
scattered
fractions
of
the
division
which
wellington
had
only
just
begun
to
draw
together
when
he
saw
that
the
reconnaissance
was
being
made
by
no
less
than
horse
there
was
not
time
to
concentrate
because
the
posts
of
picton
s
battalions
were
too
close
to
the
enemy
and
the
position
was
unsatisfactory
graham
who
had
surveyed
it
a
few
weeks
before
remarks
in
his
diary
that
it
was
by
no
means
favourable
extensive
yet
very
narrow
and
the
right
thrown
back
across
the
plain
towards
the
ford
by
pastores
where
there
is
little
advantage
of
ground
but
a
bank
and
a
little
that
of
lamotte
and
hussars
and
and
that
of
fournier
graham
s
diary
in
his
by
delavoye
at
the
moment
when
montbrun
broke
through
the
cavalry
screen
picton
s
infantry
was
strung
out
on
a
front
of
six
miles
the
and
three
companies
of
the
were
at
pastores
near
the
agueda
the
remainder
of
wallace
s
brigade
the
and
was
three
miles
of
pastores
in
the
village
of
el
bodon
colville
s
brigade
and
the
portuguese
were
equally
split
up
the
and
with
the
portuguese
in
support
being
on
high
ground
across
the
road
from
rodrigo
to
fuente
guinaldo
in
the
centre
while
the
left
section
of
the
front
of
the
division
and
portuguese
was
on
lower
ground
two
miles
west
of
colville
in
the
direction
of
campillo
alten
s
cavalry
brigade
having
sent
a
squadron
of
the
light
dragoons
to
watch
craufurd
s
front
beyond
the
agueda
and
having
strong
pickets
out
to
right
and
left
had
only
sabres
left
as
its
main
body
these
five
weak
squadrons
three
of
the
hussars
two
of
the
light
dragoons
were
across
the
near
the
and
and
with
them
the
two
portuguese
batteries
under
major
arentschildt
which
formed
the
divisional
artillery
of
picton
wallace
of
the
was
commanding
the
brigade
vice
mackinnon
on
sick
leave
in
england
marmont
on
discovering
the
scattered
position
of
the
allies
could
hardly
believe
that
they
had
nothing
more
in
his
front
than
what
he
saw
four
groups
of
two
or
three
battalions
each
with
huge
gaps
between
them
he
suspected
that
wellington
must
have
reserves
close
behind
not
thinking
it
likely
that
he
would
have
kept
infantry
so
close
to
ciudad
rodrigo
unless
he
were
in
force
to
resist
an
attack
he
accordingly
resolved
not
to
send
for
his
infantry
from
the
rear
and
engage
in
a
serious
action
but
to
direct
montbrun
to
drive
in
one
section
of
the
hostile
front
with
his
heavy
column
of
cavalry
and
so
to
discover
the
exact
strength
and
position
of
the
allies
it
was
lucky
for
wellington
that
the
marshal
limited
his
ambitions
to
this
modest
scheme
montbrun
resolved
to
break
in
the
allied
centre
across
the
and
advanced
up
it
leaving
on
his
left
the
two
fractions
of
wallace
s
brigade
in
pastores
and
el
bodon
if
he
could
pierce
the
centre
this
wing
would
be
in
a
disastrous
plight
being
cut
off
from
its
line
of
retreat
and
its
power
of
rejoining
wellington
at
fuente
guinaldo
accordingly
the
whole
of
the
french
horse
came
up
against
the
position
across
the
road
where
colville
s
two
battalions
and
arentschildt
s
batteries
blocked
the
way
while
alten
s
five
squadrons
were
covering
their
flank
the
contest
was
of
an
abnormal
sort
horse
with
one
battery
attacking
a
smaller
force
of
all
arms
infantry
sabres
and
two
batteries
comme
la
position
des
anglais
était
très
dominante
je
ne
pouvais
juger
quelles
forces
ils
avaient
en
arrière
il
était
possible
que
ses
premières
troupes
fussent
soutenues
par
d

ne
voulant
pas
risquer
un
engagement
sérieux
en
les
faisant
attaquer
par
la

fût
à

thiébault
je
pris
le
parti
de
n
employer
à
l
attaque
que
de
la
cavalerie
et
de
l
artillerie
si
l
ennemi
était
en
force
elle
en
serait
quitte
pour
se
iv
p
not
counting
the
portuguese
which
came
up
later
and
was
not
engaged
in
the
actual
combat
it
was
most
important
to
wellington
that
the
detachment
across
the
road
should
not
be
driven
in
and
he
gave
orders
that
it
was
to
hold
its
ground
to
the
last
possible
minute
in
order
to
allow
the
battalions
in
pastores
and
el
bodon
time
to
escape
from
their
compromised
position
and
to
fall
into
the
line
of
retreat
behind
the
detaining
force
his
command
was
well
obeyed
and
a
most
gallant
struggle
was
kept
up
for
more
than
an
hour
under
the
s
own
eyes
montbrun
came
on
with
three
columns
abreast
each
formed
of
a
brigade
while
a
fourth
brigade
formed
his
reserve
his
left
column
tried
to
turn
the
right
of
alten
s
cavalry
his
centre
column
attacked
its
front
his
right
column
supported
by
a
battery
moved
up
against
the
portuguese
guns
and
their
infantry
supports
there
was
fierce
fighting
all
along
the
line
the
allied
horse
aided
by
the
steep
slope
in
their
favour
made
a
wonderful
fight
against
the
superior
numbers
of
the
enemy
who
had
to
attack
in
each
point
on
a
narrow
front
since
only
parts
of
the
hillside
were
open
ground
suitable
for
cavalry
movements
each
time
that
the
leading
french
squadron
neared
the
crest
it
was
charged
and
thrown
back
the
and
one
squadron
of
the
germans
dealt
with
the
flank
attack
the
rest
of
the
legionary
hussars
with
that
in
the
centre
the
defence
was
most
desperate
consisting
in
a
long
series
of
partial
charges
in
which
one
or
more
of
the
defending
squadrons
beat
back
the
head
of
the
hostile
advance
and
then
retired
under
cover
of
the
others
montbrun
having
six
or
seven
regiments
with
him
was
always
able
to
launch
a
new
attack
up
the
hillside
the
moment
that
the
last
had
been
foiled
the
colonel
of
the
german
hussars
wrote
that
from
first
to
last
the
enemy
came
on
nearly
forty
times
yet
never
was
allowed
to
reach
the
crest
the
individual
squadrons
of
his
regiment
and
of
the
had
charged
eight
or
nine
times
each
the
best
account
of
this
fine
skirmish
carefully
constructed
from
original
authorities
is
in
schwertfeger
s
of
the
german
i
meanwhile
to
the
right
of
the
plateau
which
the
cavalry
defended
so
gallantly
the
third
french
cavalry
column
had
attacked
the
portuguese
batteries
whose
fire
was
sweeping
down
the
road
a
dragoon
brigade
though
suffering
heavily
from
the
grape
poured
into
it
as
the
range
grew
close
succeeded
in
making
its
way
to
the
guns
and
burst
in
among
them
capturing
four
pieces
the
artillerymen
had
held
their
ground
to
the
last
and
earned
wellington
s
praise
for
their
steadiness
but
the
pieces
were
not
lost
close
in
support
of
them
was
the
first
battalion
of
the
regiment
under
major
ridge
who
when
the
hostile
horsemen
halted
for
a
moment
around
the
captured
guns
attacked
them
without
hesitation
in
line
the
battalion
advanced
firing
and
with
three
volleys
broke
the
dragoons
who
were
blown
with
their
charge
and
in
much
disorder
they
recoiled
down
the
hill
in
complete
rout
and
the
portuguese
gunners
were
able
to
get
their
pieces
in
action
again
and
resume
their
very
effective
fire
this
was
a
rare
example
of
a
successful
attack
on
cavalry
by
infantry
in
line
it
could
not
have
been
tried
against
intact
squadrons
for
there
was
no
for
the
and
an
enemy
in
good
order
would
have
turned
the
battalion
and
cut
it
up
from
the
side
but
ridge
saw
that
the
french
were
in
complete
disarray
and
unfit
for
the
moment
to
manœuvre
wherefore
he
was
justified
in
trying
the
movement
which
had
such
complete
success
arentschildt
s
gunners
did
not
suffer
so
much
as
might
have
been
expected
and
wellington
was
inaccurate
when
in
his
dispatch
he
says
that
they
were
cut
down
at
their
guns
the
portuguese
returns
show
that
they
lost
only
one
man
killed
and
four
wounded
the
french
at
last
gave
up
their
frontal
attacks
it
is
said
that
when
the
trumpets
blew
for
one
more
advance
the
allies
saw
the
regiment
at
the
head
of
the
column
refuse
to
move
forward
montbrun
thereupon
tried
a
move
which
he
might
well
have
made
half
an
hour
earlier
he
began
to
extend
his
hitherto
concentrated
brigades
and
thrust
one
of
them
into
the
gap
between
the
hill
that
he
could
not
force
and
the
village
of
el
bodon
wellington
then
gave
back
picton
and
the
two
battalions
in
el
bodon
had
by
this
time
evacuated
it
and
were
as
ordered
on
their
way
to
the
rear
the
still
more
compromised
detachment
in
pastores
had
also
got
away
and
was
making
for
fuente
guinaldo
by
a
very
circuitous
road
it
forded
the
agueda
went
ten
miles
on
its
further
side
where
no
french
were
as
yet
visible
and
then
recrossed
again
near
robleda
joining
the
division
at
dusk
the
second
period
of
the
combat
of
el
bodon
to
give
its
usual
name
to
the
engagement
was
less
bloody
than
the
first
but
quite
as
exciting
wellington
s
order
of
retreat
was
that
the
two
batteries
of
arentschildt
with
a
cavalry
escort
went
first
then
the
portuguese
which
had
remained
in
reserve
all
through
the
earlier
fighting
then
the
and
in
a
single
square
and
lastly
two
squadrons
of
the
german
hussars
which
remained
on
the
position
till
the
last
moment
this
column
retreating
along
the
had
in
front
of
it
and
ultimately
caught
up
the
other
fractions
of
the
division
picton
s
two
battalions
which
had
come
in
from
the
right
and
the
and
portuguese
which
had
fallen
into
the
road
from
the
left
but
in
the
first
hour
of
the
retreat
these
detachments
had
not
yet
been
overtaken
they
only
made
up
bayonets
between
them
and
the
only
strong
would
have
made
a
very
small
square
by
itself
montbrun
pressed
on
fiercely
the
moment
that
he
saw
that
the
hill
so
long
held
against
him
had
been
abandoned
and
beset
the
retreating
column
on
all
sides
as
it
marched
along
the
flat
the
hussars
in
the
rear
were
driven
in
by
overwhelming
numbers
and
had
to
retire
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
portuguese
this
left
the
square
composed
of
the
and
exposed
to
the
full
force
of
the
enemy
montbrun
caused
it
to
be
charged
on
three
sides
at
once
but
the
british
infantry
showed
no
disorder
reserved
their
fire
till
the
enemy
was
within
thirty
paces
and
then
executed
such
a
regular
and
effective
series
of
volleys
that
the
dragoons
were
beaten
off
with
loss
and
could
not
close
at
any
point
the
german
squadrons
then
turned
back
and
charged
them
as
they
retired
in
disorder
this
repulse
checked
the
french
for
half
an
hour
but
presently
they
were
up
again
not
only
hovering
round
the
two
squares
that
of
the
and
and
that
of
the
portuguese
which
brought
up
the
rear
but
riding
all
down
the
side
of
the
division
which
now
formed
one
long
column
of
march
but
they
dared
not
charge
again
montbrun
merely
brought
up
his
battery
and
plied
the
enemy
with
fire
from
several
successive
positions
it
was
not
ineffective
but
the
allied
infantry
refused
to
be
troubled
with
it
and
continued
to
march
as
hard
as
they
could
along
the
for
six
miles
across
a
perfect
flat
writes
an
without
the
slightest
protection
from
any
incident
of
ground
without
their
artillery
and
almost
without
cavalry
for
what
were
five
squadrons
against
twenty
or
thirty
did
the
division
continue
its
march
during
the
whole
time
the
french
cavalry
never
quitted
them
six
guns
were
taking
the
division
in
flank
and
rear
pouring
in
a
shower
of
round
shot
grape
and
canister
this
was
a
trying
and
pitiable
situation
for
troops
to
be
placed
in
but
it
in
no
way
shook
their
courage
or
confidence
so
far
from
being
dispirited
or
cast
down
the
men
were
cheerful
and
gay
the
soldiers
of
my
own
corps
the
told
their
officers
that
if
the
french
would
only
charge
every
officer
should
have
a
horse
to
ride
upon
general
picton
conducted
himself
with
his
usual
coolness
he
rode
on
the
left
flank
of
the
column
and
repeatedly
cautioned
the
different
battalions
to
mind
their
and
the
tellings
we
had
at
last
got
close
to
the
entrenched
camp
at
fuente
guinaldo
when
montbrun
impatient
that
we
should
escape
from
his
grasp
ordered
his
troopers
to
bring
up
their
right
shoulders
and
incline
towards
our
marching
column
the
movement
was
not
exactly
bringing
his
squadrons
into
line
but
the
next
thing
to
it
and
they
were
within
half
of
us
picton
took
off
his
hat
and
holding
it
over
his
eyes
as
a
shade
from
the
sun
looked
sternly
but
anxiously
at
the
french
the
clatter
of
the
horses
and
the
clanking
of
the
sabres
was
so
great
when
the
right
squadrons
moved
up
that
many
thought
it
the
preliminary
to
a
general
charge
some
mounted
officer
called
out
had
we
not
better
form
square
no
replied
picton
it
is
only
a
ruse
to
frighten
us
and
it
t
memoirs
of
grattan
of
the
pp
montbrun
s
bolt
indeed
was
shot
for
by
this
time
troops
were
coming
out
from
fuente
guinaldo
to
cover
the
retreating
division
de
grey
s
heavy
dragoons
who
had
just
come
up
from
the
coa
at
the
head
of
them
the
french
horse
slackened
their
pace
and
finally
drew
off
half
an
hour
later
the
retreating
column
had
taken
up
its
destined
position
in
the
entrenched
camp
where
the
division
was
awaiting
it
this
long
straggling
fight
cost
the
allies
only
casualties
the
cavalry
had
lost
men
in
their
long
fight
to
hold
the
hill
which
they
so
long
guarded
on
the
flank
of
the
infantry
the
and
had
lost
men
not
by
the
sabres
of
the
cavalry
whom
they
had
driven
off
so
serenely
but
by
the
artillery
fire
which
followed
the
other
eight
infantry
battalions
of
the
division
british
and
portuguese
had
lost
only
men
in
all
mostly
it
is
to
be
presumed
by
the
cannonade
during
the
retreat
the
portuguese
gunners
had
only
men
hurt
a
light
loss
considering
that
the
enemy
s
dragoons
had
been
among
their
pieces
for
five
minutes
hussars
killed
officers
and
men
wounded
men
missing
light
dragoons
killed
officers
and
men
wounded
montbrun
s
loss
is
nowhere
accurately
stated
but
was
probably
about
at
the
least
thirteen
officers
had
been
hit
in
the
four
brigades
engaged
and
though
cavalry
was
more
heavily
officered
in
proportion
to
its
numbers
than
infantry
we
can
hardly
suppose
that
where
officers
fell
less
than
rank
and
file
were
killed
or
wounded
according
to
martinien
s
invaluable
lists
the
dragoons
lost
officers
the
the
and
dragoons
each
the
and
dragoons
each
wellington
was
lucky
to
have
paid
no
greater
price
for
his
rash
maintenance
of
a
position
so
dangerously
close
to
the
walls
of
ciudad
rodrigo
if
marmont
had
brought
up
infantry
close
behind
his
great
cavalry
force
the
division
would
have
suffered
far
more
it
might
even
have
been
destroyed
but
there
was
as
we
have
seen
only
one
french
infantry
division
under
arms
on
the
morning
of
the
that
of
thiébault
three
more
were
encamped
beyond
rodrigo
the
rest
were
still
some
miles
to
the
rear
halting
by
the
guadapero
river
marmont
sent
for
thiébault
when
he
had
discovered
the
position
and
the
weakness
of
picton
s
scattered
brigades
but
luckily
for
the
british
dorsenne
had
also
dispatched
orders
to
this
division
which
formed
part
of
his
own
army
of
the
north
he
had
been
alarmed
at
the
strength
of
the
allies
on
the
azava
which
wathier
had
discovered
and
had
told
thiébault
to
march
to
his
right
and
support
the
cavalry
on
the
carpio
road
when
masséna
s
arrived
to
hurry
up
this
infantry
it
was
found
to
have
gone
off
some
miles
to
the
and
though
promptly
recalled
it
did
not
reach
the
ground
in
front
of
fuente
guinaldo
till
late
in
the
evening
deprived
of
thiébault
s
battalions
by
this
chance
one
of
the
many
results
of
a
divided
command
marmont
summoned
up
the
three
divisions
which
lay
on
the
other
side
of
rodrigo
not
having
been
warned
for
service
on
this
day
they
took
some
time
to
get
under
arms
and
more
to
file
over
the
narrow
bridge
over
the
agueda
they
only
reached
and
joined
the
marshal
and
montbrun
a
short
time
before
thiébault
arrived
thus
all
day
marmont
had
no
infantry
in
hand
with
which
to
support
his
cavalry
but
at
nightfall
he
had
bayonets
at
the
front
and
the
five
rear
divisions
left
hitherto
on
the
guadapero
were
also
coming
up
and
had
reached
and
passed
the
agueda
there
would
be
nearly
men
at
the
front
by
noon
on
the
marmont
in
his
iv
says
that
he
sent
for
thiébault
s
division
when
montbrun
was
checked
but
l
ordre
envoyé
lentement
fut
exécuté
plus
lentement
encore
and
thiébault
only
appeared
at
nightfall
the
general
himself
gives
the
explanation
iv
the
french
right
the
wing
towards
carpio
seeming
to
be
menaced
they
sent
me
off
to
a
point
where
no
enemy
was
to
be
wellington
s
position
at
fuente
guinaldo
was
therefore
very
hazardous
when
night
fell
on
the
he
had
only
assembled
in
the
entrenchments
the
and
divisions
pack
s
independent
portuguese
brigade
and
the
cavalry
of
alten
de
grey
and
slade
or
about
men
he
had
sent
orders
to
the
other
fractions
of
his
army
to
concentrate
there
but
it
was
certain
that
some
and
possible
that
others
of
them
would
not
get
up
on
the
morning
of
the
the
concentration
orders
had
gone
out
too
late
graham
was
directed
to
unite
the
and
divisions
and
mcmahon
s
portuguese
at
nava
de
aver
abandoning
the
lower
azava
to
a
rearguard
composed
of
anson
s
cavalry
he
was
as
he
wrote
to
his
cathcart
amazingly
relieved
to
have
permission
to
draw
in
towards
the
centre
but
the
orders
came
late
and
did
not
go
far
enough
at
nava
de
aver
which
he
reached
at
noon
on
the
he
had
men
collected
but
he
was
still
twelve
miles
from
fuente
guinaldo
and
the
road
to
that
point
by
puebla
de
azava
was
not
out
of
reach
of
molestation
by
the
french
it
was
only
in
the
afternoon
that
he
received
a
second
dispatch
telling
him
not
to
move
on
fuente
guinaldo
but
to
get
behind
the
villar
mayor
stream
and
march
by
a
circuitous
route
through
villar
mayor
and
bismula
to
join
the
main
army
at
a
point
more
to
the
rear
the
had
resolved
to
evacuate
fuente
guinaldo
graham
to
cathcart
in
his
by
delavoye
graham
s
diary
august
thus
by
his
own
fault
wellington
was
short
of
two
divisions
and
a
brigade
from
his
left
in
the
perilous
afternoon
hours
of
the
and
on
his
right
also
he
was
weak
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
had
deliberately
left
craufurd
upon
the
vadillo
beyond
the
azava
till
the
at
the
moment
when
the
combat
of
el
bodon
began
tardy
directions
were
sent
to
craufurd
to
move
the
light
division
to
join
the
army
by
the
ford
of
carros
near
robleda
high
up
the
azava
for
it
was
no
longer
possible
for
him
to
use
the
easy
passage
by
the
ford
of
zamorra
close
under
pastores
since
the
french
had
gained
possession
of
it
when
they
thrust
the
division
southward
craufurd
leaving
only
cavalry
pickets
along
the
vadillo
river
retreated
that
night
to
cespedosa
a
few
miles
south
of
his
former
post
at
martiago
but
he
refused
to
make
a
night
march
to
the
ford
of
carros
because
the
road
was
rough
and
difficult
and
he
thought
it
likely
that
his
column
might
get
astray
and
that
some
or
all
of
his
baggage
might
be
lost
very
possibly
he
was
right
but
the
result
of
his
not
starting
from
cespedosa
till
the
dawn
of
the
was
that
all
through
the
long
morning
hours
and
early
afternoon
of
that
day
he
was
not
in
line
at
fuente
guinaldo
where
his
chief
wished
to
have
him
he
only
got
there
after
a
fatiguing
march
of
miles
along
the
upper
agueda
and
over
the
ford
of
carros
at
four
o
clock
when
dusk
was
drawing
near
meanwhile
marmont
had
been
for
all
the
day
in
a
position
to
attack
wellington
with
very
superior
numbers
for
notes
on
this
point
see
the
life
of
craufurd
by
his
grandson
rev
alex
craufurd
pp
wellington
was
vexed
that
the
light
division
had
not
done
the
night
march
and
according
to
larpent
s
observed
to
craufurd
with
some
asperity
i
am
glad
to
see
you
the
answer
was
oh
i
was
in
no
danger
i
assure
but
i
was
from
your
conduct
answered
wellington
upon
which
craufurd
observed
he
s
d
d
crusty
the
account
of
the
march
of
the
light
division
on
this
day
is
quite
satisfactory
i
have
sir
john
bell
s
note
that
the
idea
that
craufurd
thought
for
a
moment
of
retreating
by
the
pass
of
perales
because
he
feared
being
intercepted
at
robleda
is
it
has
often
been
remarked
especially
by
french
critics
that
craufurd
and
his
men
were
in
grave
danger
on
the
afternoon
of
the
and
the
morning
of
the
since
if
marmont
had
sent
out
a
heavy
column
on
the
right
bank
of
the
agueda
to
push
the
light
division
it
would
not
have
been
able
to
use
the
ford
near
robleda
and
must
have
fallen
back
into
the
rough
country
at
the
sources
of
the
agueda
where
it
might
have
been
overtaken
and
have
suffered
heavily
for
want
of
a
road
that
would
have
served
for
its
baggage
the
danger
has
been
exaggerated
though
the
baggage
might
very
probably
have
been
lost
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
the
troops
from
taking
to
the
and
getting
to
payo
or
the
passes
of
gata
by
some
circuitous
route
all
that
a
hot
pursuit
could
have
done
would
have
been
to
make
craufurd
unable
to
reach
fuente
guinaldo
as
he
actually
did
upon
the
this
would
no
doubt
have
been
something
of
an
advantage
to
the
french
but
marmont
would
have
lost
the
services
of
the
force
sent
in
pursuit
which
would
have
had
to
be
very
strong
since
no
mere
detachment
would
have
been
able
to
venture
near
the
light
division
on
pain
of
being
brought
to
action
and
defeated
marmont
iv
is
very
sure
that
he
could
have
isolated
turned
and
enveloped
craufurd
and
have
destroyed
him
but
it
is
hard
to
see
that
he
could
really
have
done
more
than
drive
him
on
to
an
eccentric
line
of
retreat
it
seems
that
marmont
s
quiescence
in
front
of
the
camp
of
fuente
guinaldo
during
the
perilous
hours
of
the
morning
and
noon
of
september
was
caused
by
a
reluctance
to
tackle
wellington
when
he
had
taken
up
a
position
and
was
offering
battle
he
writes
in
his
that
as
the
day
wore
on
i
had
men
assembled
within
of
the
english
front
but
the
enemy
was
known
to
have
collected
if
not
all
at
any
rate
a
very
great
part
of
his
force
and
was
in
an
entrenched
position
much
tempted
to
take
advantage
of
the
union
of
the
armies
of
portugal
and
the
north
and
to
make
a
stroke
for
victory
i
passed
the
day
in
studying
the
english
position
attacks
made
without
careful
preparation
during
the
recent
campaigns
bussaco
and
fuentes
de
oñoro
had
succeeded
so
badly
that
i
was
deterred
from
inconsiderate
action
moreover
general
dorsenne
who
was
only
under
my
command
accidentally
and
by
his
own
consent
had
no
wish
for
a
battle
and
this
rendered
the
enterprise
more
delicate
then
too
if
we
tried
our
luck
and
were
successful
we
were
not
in
a
condition
to
make
profit
of
a
successful
engagement
by
pursuing
the
english
into
portugal
if
they
were
beaten
so
finally
i
gave
up
the
idea
of
forcing
on
a
fight
thiébault
iv
there
is
an
amusing
picture
of
marmont
s
hesitation
drawn
by
general
thiébault
in
his
clever
but
malicious
autobiography
in
this
a
very
different
rôle
is
attributed
to
the
commander
of
the
army
of
the
north
at
nine
o
clock
the
marshal
and
general
dorsenne
rode
to
the
front
with
their
glittering
staffs
the
troops
were
put
under
arms
at
once
but
the
great
men
descended
from
their
horses
and
got
out
telescopes
with
which
they
began
to
study
the
english
position
yes
began
the
marshal
determined
to
see
that
which
was
not
visible
as
he
peered
through
the
large
glass
balanced
on
the
shoulder
of
one
of
his
yes
my
information
was
correct
the
right
of
the
english
line
is
flanked
by
an
inaccessible
general
dorsenne
and
i
had
excellent
telescopes
but
we
could
not
see
any
such
precipice
dorsenne
told
the
marshal
as
much
taking
no
notice
of
his
remark
marmont
continued
the
whole
camp
is
protected
by
closed
dorsenne
after
exchanging
some
words
with
me
replied
that
he
could
only
make
out
a
few
points
at
which
earthworks
had
been
thrown
up
the
marshal
ignoring
the
observations
of
his
interlocutor
went
on
and
just
as
i
have
been
told
these
closed
redoubts
are
armed
with
heavy
guns
of
position
forwarded
from
almeida
nothing
can
be
done
he
forthwith
adjourned
his
reconnoitring
and
invited
the
generals
to
a
heavy
and
sumptuous
meal
served
on
silver
plate
in
front
of
the
line
after
the
feast
montbrun
remarked
the
english
position
is
impregnable
the
thing
that
proves
it
so
is
that
wellington
is
offering
us
battle
upon
it
we
shall
never
make
an
end
of
him
by
running
at
him
head
down
that
would
have
no
good
marmont
soon
after
delivered
his
decision
that
rodrigo
having
been
relieved
and
the
position
of
the
english
being
too
strong
he
intended
to
advance
no
further
and
should
retire
next
marmont
iv
pp
if
thiébault
s
report
of
montbrun
s
words
and
marmont
s
attitude
be
correct
it
is
clear
that
wellington
had
by
mere
bluffing
brought
the
enemy
to
a
standstill
he
was
using
the
reputation
for
caution
which
he
had
gained
in
his
former
campaigns
as
a
moral
weapon
the
syllogism
wellington
never
fights
save
when
he
has
his
army
in
hand
and
has
found
a
good
position
he
offers
to
fight
now
therefore
he
feels
himself
safe
against
any
attack
seemed
a
legitimate
logical
process
to
marmont
and
montbrun
so
the
english
general
had
hoped
but
he
did
not
know
how
entirely
successful
his
demonstration
had
been
and
thought
that
the
reconnaissance
followed
by
a
halt
which
he
had
observed
in
the
morning
meant
that
the
enemy
was
going
to
bring
up
his
last
reserves
before
attacking
the
rear
divisions
of
the
army
of
portugal
were
seen
to
arrive
in
the
french
lines
when
the
day
was
far
spent
wellington
supposed
that
marmont
had
been
waiting
for
them
and
would
use
them
for
a
great
combined
attack
on
the
he
had
no
intention
of
awaiting
it
even
though
the
light
division
had
reached
him
and
instead
of
ordering
the
other
absent
units
of
his
army
to
close
in
upon
fuente
guinaldo
sent
orders
to
them
all
to
place
themselves
in
the
second
position
nine
miles
to
the
rear
which
he
had
chosen
as
his
real
the
force
at
fuente
guinaldo
decamped
after
dusk
leaving
the
light
division
and
the
hussars
to
keep
up
the
bivouac
fires
along
the
whole
line
till
midnight
marching
in
two
columns
one
by
the
direct
road
by
casillas
de
flores
and
furcalhos
the
other
by
a
secondary
path
through
aldea
da
ponte
the
whole
reached
the
positions
in
front
of
alfayates
where
wellington
was
ready
to
make
his
real
stand
on
the
morning
of
the
the
main
body
was
joined
by
the
division
which
came
down
from
payo
in
the
sierra
de
gata
having
found
no
enemy
threatening
the
passes
in
that
direction
the
division
also
arrived
from
albergaria
meanwhile
graham
with
the
and
divisions
and
mcmahon
s
portuguese
had
arrived
at
bismula
and
rendo
and
so
was
at
last
in
close
touch
with
the
main
body
the
whole
of
wellington
s
men
were
concentrated
and
well
knowing
the
strength
of
the
position
which
he
had
now
reached
his
mind
was
tranquil
the
front
was
hidden
by
a
strong
cavalry
screen
alten
s
brigade
covering
the
right
de
grey
s
and
slade
s
the
centre
and
anson
s
the
left
where
graham
s
divisions
lay
marmont
was
so
far
from
guessing
that
his
adversary
would
abandon
the
position
of
fuente
guinaldo
that
he
had
ordered
his
own
army
to
retreat
towards
rodrigo
at
the
very
moment
that
the
allies
were
absconding
from
his
front
during
the
early
hours
of
the
night
of
the
the
two
adversaries
were
marching
away
from
each
other
but
at
midnight
thiébault
who
was
in
charge
of
the
rearguard
noted
that
the
fires
in
wellington
s
lines
seemed
few
and
flickering
and
that
his
sentries
had
got
out
of
touch
with
those
of
the
british
a
reconnaissance
soon
showed
him
that
there
was
nothing
left
in
his
front
prompt
information
was
sent
to
marmont
and
the
marshal
had
to
reconsider
his
position
he
determined
to
follow
up
the
retreating
enemy
not
with
the
fixed
intention
of
bringing
him
to
action
but
rather
that
he
might
be
ready
to
take
advantage
of
any
unforeseen
chance
that
might
occur
but
the
pursuit
could
not
be
rapid
or
effective
for
during
the
night
the
bulk
of
the
army
of
portugal
had
been
marching
back
towards
ciudad
rodrigo
montbrun
s
and
wathier
s
cavalry
were
still
at
the
front
but
only
two
infantry
divisions
those
of
souham
and
thiébault
both
belonging
to
the
army
of
the
north
the
marshal
dared
not
press
his
enemy
too
hard
lest
wellington
should
turn
upon
him
and
find
that
only
infantry
were
up
on
the
french
side
while
the
countermarch
of
the
other
seven
divisions
was
in
progress
the
vanguard
must
not
commit
itself
unsupported
to
a
general
action
accordingly
wellington
s
retreat
was
not
seriously
incommoded
montbrun
followed
by
souham
s
division
took
the
road
by
casillas
de
flores
and
furcalhos
wathier
with
thiébault
s
infantry
in
support
that
by
aldea
da
ponte
montbrun
ran
about
noon
against
the
light
and
divisions
and
alten
s
horse
drawn
up
in
position
in
front
of
alfayates
and
considered
them
too
strongly
placed
to
be
meddled
with
wathier
on
the
western
road
was
stopped
in
front
of
aldea
da
ponte
by
the
pickets
of
the
division
and
of
slade
s
dragoons
this
village
lay
outside
the
intended
line
of
battle
of
the
allied
army
but
so
close
in
front
of
it
that
wellington
had
resolved
not
to
let
it
go
till
he
was
pushed
by
a
strong
force
since
it
was
the
of
several
roads
and
well
placed
for
observation
wathier
halted
facing
aldea
da
ponte
till
thiébault
came
up
and
assumed
the
command
being
senior
to
the
cavalry
general
seeing
that
the
village
was
worth
having
thiébault
resolved
to
attack
it
and
drove
out
the
light
companies
of
the
fusilier
brigade
by
an
advance
of
the
three
battalions
of
the
léger
one
of
which
cleared
the
village
while
the
other
two
turned
it
on
each
flank
wellington
observing
that
the
enemy
had
only
a
single
division
on
the
ground
refused
to
allow
aldea
da
ponte
to
be
so
lightly
lost
and
sent
against
the
french
the
whole
fusilier
brigade
in
line
flanked
by
a
portuguese
regiment
in
column
this
advance
forced
thiébault
s
first
brigade
back
from
the
village
and
thrust
it
northward
some
way
upon
the
road
here
the
french
rallied
upon
their
second
brigade
and
formed
up
with
wathier
s
horse
in
support
wellington
would
not
push
them
further
and
contented
himself
with
having
recovered
aldea
da
ponte
and
the
junction
of
the
roads
thiébault
in
his
elaborate
account
of
the
skirmish
iv
pp
says
that
he
did
not
lose
aldea
da
ponte
but
i
prefer
to
take
wellington
s
definite
statement
that
he
did
supported
by
those
of
vere
the
of
the
division
and
lord
londonderry
both
at
dusk
however
montbrun
and
souham
came
up
and
joined
thiébault
with
the
column
which
had
followed
the
furcalhos
road
souham
determined
to
try
again
the
attack
in
which
thiébault
had
been
checked
and
assailed
aldea
da
ponte
just
as
the
light
was
failing
the
fusiliers
were
driven
out
of
the
village
and
wellington
refused
to
reinforce
them
or
to
allow
them
to
make
a
second
because
he
did
not
wish
to
get
entangled
in
heavy
fighting
in
the
dark
or
to
expend
many
lives
upon
keeping
a
place
which
was
outside
his
line
and
formed
no
essential
part
of
it
there
had
been
much
skirmishing
all
through
the
afternoon
between
slade
s
two
cavalry
regiments
and
wathier
s
in
which
neither
party
had
any
appreciable
losses
nor
gained
any
marked
advantage
the
casualties
in
this
rearguard
action
were
just
of
which
were
in
the
fusilier
brigade
in
the
portuguese
battalions
which
had
covered
its
flank
and
in
slade
s
cavalry
thiébault
says
that
he
lost
men
a
very
probable
estimate
he
adds
that
the
british
lost
and
that
he
was
engaged
against
allied
troops
which
considering
that
he
fought
no
one
save
the
three
battalions
of
the
fusilier
brigade
one
regiment
of
portuguese
and
slade
s
horse
sabres
and
bayonets
seems
sufficiently
astounding
it
may
serve
as
a
fair
example
of
his
method
of
dealing
with
figures
thirty
killed
and
wounded
martinien
s
lists
show
casualties
among
officers
of
thiébault
s
regiments
in
the
léger
in
the
regiment
of
neuchâtel
in
the
of
the
vistula
this
at
the
average
rate
of
or
officers
per
man
seems
just
right
by
a
tiresome
misprint
thiébault
speaks
of
himself
as
commanding
the
léger
in
many
places
it
was
really
the
the
was
in
the
army
of
portugal
not
in
that
of
the
north
next
morning
wellington
s
line
was
drawn
back
into
the
position
in
which
he
had
determined
to
fight
with
the
french
column
at
aldea
da
ponte
lying
two
miles
in
his
front
on
the
lower
ground
this
position
which
was
about
seven
miles
long
was
covered
on
either
flank
by
the
ravine
of
the
coa
which
here
makes
a
deep
hook
or
curve
with
the
town
of
sabugal
at
its
point
the
right
wing
was
formed
of
the
division
holding
the
village
of
aldea
velha
on
a
steep
hill
by
the
source
of
the
coa
the
which
projected
somewhat
was
composed
of
the
and
light
divisions
ranged
in
front
of
the
town
of
alfayates
close
by
the
convent
of
sacaparte
from
that
point
westward
the
line
was
taken
up
by
pack
s
and
mcmahon
s
portuguese
brigades
on
each
side
of
the
village
of
nave
finally
the
left
consisted
of
the
and
divisions
under
graham
reaching
from
near
rendo
as
far
as
the
bridge
of
rapoulla
this
wing
was
covered
in
front
by
the
ravine
of
a
torrent
flowing
into
the
coa
the
central
reserve
was
formed
of
the
and
divisions
with
de

and
slade
s
dragoons
drawn
up
behind

light
cavalry

with
the
light

its
pickets
thrown
out
on
the
furcalhos
road
anson

brigade
was
placed
in
front
of
nave
and
bismula
with
its
advanced
vedettes
watching
the
french
in
aldea
da
ponte
the
position
was
well
marked
and
masked
by
woods
and
ravines
its
only
fault
was
that
the
coa
ran
round
its
rear
with
only
two
bridges
those
of
sabugal
and
rapoulla
da
coa
though
there
were
at
least
six
or
seven
fords
in
addition
and
the
stream
was
low
and
passable
almost
everywhere
for
infantry
a
defeat
however
would
probably
have
meant
much
loss
of
artillery
and
impedimenta
though
wellington
had
sent
great
part
of
his
baggage
over
the
coa
and
detached
all
his
portuguese
horse
and
the
portuguese
brigade
of
the
division
to
cover
its
retreat
no
position
is
perfect
but
wellington
did
not
think
he
could
possibly
be
evicted
from
this
one
which
was
as
strong
as
bussaco
and
not
nearly
so
long
he
wished
to
be
attacked
being
confident
of
success
wrote
graham
three
days
later
note
the
curious
misprint
in
the
first
line
of
of
vol
viii
of
light
for
light
unless
the
misprint
is
noticed
the
reader
will
ask
why
wellington
has
omitted
craufurd
in
describing
his
order
of
battle
napier
i
know
not
why
has
altogether
neglected
to
explain
the
distribution
of
the
british
army
in
the
short
paragraph
of
vol
iii
which
describes
this
day
s
operations
graham
to
cathcart
october
in
delavoye
s
of
lord
but
his
adversaries
would
not
oblige
him
after
coming
up
to
aldea
da
ponte
and
rebuking
thiébault
and
souham
for
engaging
in
a
profitless
skirmish
on
the
preceding
day
marmont
took
a
long
survey
of
the
position
of
the
allied
army
and
refused
to
advance
any
further
the
reasons
which
he
had
given
for
not
attacking
at
fuente
guinaldo
on
the
when
he
still
had
a
good
chance
of
accomplishing
great
things
were
doubly
valid
on
the
after
reasserting
to
dorsenne
and
the
other
generals
that
wellington
s
army
was
concentrated
which
was
now
quite
true
and
that
his
position
was
far
too
strong
to
be
meddled
with
and
adding
that
even
if
there
were
a
successful
action
he
could
not
pursue
wellington
into
the
mountains
for
want
of
food
he
gave
his
final
orders
for
retreat
the
main
body
of
the
army
which
had
not
come
further
forward
than
fuente
guinaldo
began
to
retire
that
same
night
towards
ciudad
rodrigo
the
two
infantry
divisions
at
aldea
da
ponte
and
the
cavalry
of
montbrun
and
wathier
brought
up
and
covered
the
rear
by
the
morning
of
the
the
crisis
was
over
and
wellington
was
dictating
orders
for
the
breaking
up
of
his
army
and
its
distribution
into
cantonments
thiébault
s
feelings
were
much
hurt
at
the

being
called

after
retiring
to

marmont
and
dorsenne
parted
company
on
october
and
each
dispersed
his
troops
into
cantonments
the
army
of

recrossed
the
sierra
de

and
was
distributed
by
divisions
in
the
same
regions
of
new
castile
that
it
had
occupied
in
september
on
returning
to
his
head
quarters
at
talavera
marmont
received
the
report
of
foy
commanding
the
only
section
of
his
army
which
had
not
taken
part
in
the
recent
campaign
that
general
had
been
ordered
to
demonstrate
from
plasencia
against
wellington
s
rear
during
the
revictualling
of
ciudad
rodrigo
with
six
battalions
and
a
regiment
of
light
cavalry
about
men
he
had
taken
the
direction
of
the
pass
of
perales
he
reached
moraleja
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
near
coria
on
september
the
day
of
the
combat
of
aldea
da
ponte
next
morning
he
started
to
ascend
the
sierra
and
his
advanced
guard
got
to
payo
on
the
there
it
was
discovered
that
marmont
and
dorsenne
had
abandoned
the
offensive
and
started
on
their
retreat
for
ciudad
rodrigo
on
the
so
that
no
french
troops
were
anywhere
in
the
neighbourhood
while
wellington
s
whole
army
was
near
alfayates
only
fifteen
miles
away
fearing
to
be
discovered
and
overwhelmed
foy
returned
to
plasencia
by
forced
marches
his
demonstration
had
been
some
days
too
late
to
be
of
any
use
if
he
had
appeared
in
the
perales
pass
on
the
while
the
division
was
still
holding
payo
wellington
would
have
had
to
keep
that
force
detached
to
protect
his
flank
and
could
not
have
withdrawn
it
to
join
the
rest
of
his
army
on
the
position
but
foy
came
up
only
when
the
campaign
was
over
and
his
movements
had
no
effect
whatever
the
best
commentary
on
this
five
days
of
manœuvring
between
el
bodon
and
alfayates
is
that
of
the
veteran
graham
it
was
very
pretty
but
spun
rather
fine

judged
that

have
suffered
considerable
loss
in

to

been
forced
upon

for

not

as
he
was
on

numerous
and
daring

it
may
be
added
that
if
the

had
failed
to

almeida
would
have
been
in
danger

by
half

was

such
advanced
positions
meanwhile
a
more
effective
hindrance
to

between

was
provided
julian

the

of

on

frontiers
of

was
restored
to
the

aspect
that
it
had
displayed
in
the
early
autumn
it
was
clear
that
when
ciudad
rodrigo
again
needed
to
be
revictualled
it
ought
to
be
necessary
for
the
french
to
make
another
great
effort
and
to
concentrate
once
more
an
army
of
men
marmont
had
thrown
a
great
convoy
into
the
place
but
his
calculations
as
to
the
time
that
these
stores
would
suffice
to
feed
the
garrison
had
been
wrecked
by
the
fact
that
his
own
army
and
that
of
dorsenne
had
lived
on
the
magazines
of
rodrigo
for
five
days
and
had
consumed
more
than
rations
it
had
been
intended
that
the
convoy
should
feed
rodrigo
for
six
months
but
only
two
months
food
remained
for
its
garrison
of
men
after
this
enormous
deduction
had
been
made
meanwhile
wellington
thought
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
accomplished
in
the
north
for
some
time
his
ultimate
design
was
to
make
a
serious
blow
at
ciudad
rodrigo
when
he
should
learn
that
the
disposition
of
the
armies
of
dorsenne
and
marmont
rendered
such
a
blow
practicable
as
long
as
they
lay
so
close
together
as
to
make
their
rapid
concentration
possible
he
did
not
intend
to
press
matters
but
two
indispensable
preliminaries
for
the
regular
leaguer
of
rodrigo
were
being
perfected

great
was
being
completed
at
villa
da

and
the
repairs
to
the
walls
of
almeida
were
at

finished
it
was
wellington
s
intention
to
transfer
the
to
almeida
when
that
fortress
was
absolutely
secure
against
an
attack
placed
there
it
would
be
in
a
position
to
move
up
against
rodrigo
in
two
days
when
the
time
for
action
should
come
but
it
was
not
till
november
was
far
spent
that
the
order
to
move
forward
reached
dickson
meanwhile
the
roads
between
villa
da

and

were
put
in

dickson
p
the
dispositions

the
enemy
remained
the
factor
in
the
situation
and
for
the
next
two
months
wellington
was
scrutinizing
them
with
the
greatest
care
the

after
it
had
recrossed
the

had
been
distributed
by

in
much
the

cantonments
that

reduced
to
such
a
state
of
dilapidation
by
its
late

in

sent
it

bonnet

expedition
against
the
asturias
was
executed
with
complete
success
indeed
it
met
with
hardly
any
opposition
general
losada
who
had
occupied
oviedo
after
its
evacuation
with
the
division
of
the
army
of
galicia
judged
himself
too
weak
to
fight
he
abandoned
the
pass
of
pajares
after
a
mere
skirmish
and
made
hardly
a
greater
effort
to
defend
the
passage
of
the
nalon
withdrawing
westward
towards
galicia
as
the
french
advanced
bonnet
occupied
oviedo
on
the
of
november
without
any
fighting
and
its
port
of
gijon
on
the
finding
that
losada
had
retreated
behind
the
narcea
he
sent
a
brigade
under
colonel
gauthier
to
pursue
him
this
column
reached
tineo
on
november
but
soon
had
to
retire
for
the
spaniards
had
scattered
themselves
in
small
bands
among
the
mountains
and
had
turned
back
to

gauthier

line
of
communication
with
oviedo
as
well
as
that
between
oviedo
and
the
pass
of

bonnet
found
that
to
maintain
himself
in
the
central
asturias
was
all
that
was
in
his
power
he
could
not
at
the
same
time
provide
garrisons
for
oviedo
gijon
and
the
neighbouring
places
and
also
put
in
the
field
a
force
strong
enough
to
menace
galicia
in
fact
his
fine
division
of
men
was
practically
immobilized
in
the
district
that
it
had
seized
it
is
more
than
doubtful
whether
the
emperor
was
wise
to
direct
that
the
central
asturias
should
be
once
more
occupied
he
deprived
the
army
of
the
north
of
one
of
its
five
fighting
divisions
and
left
the
force
holding
leon
and
old
castile
too
weak
to
restrain
wellington
when
it
had
at
the
same
time
to
contain
the

it
was
impossible
to
neglect

left
alone
they
executed
feats
of
great
daring
it
will
be
remembered
that
the
former
had
surprised
and
captured
santander
in
august
and
though
his
ventures
in
the
autumn
were
less
fortunate
they

which
reached
him
shortly
after
his
return
to
the
valley
of

in
this
document
a
most
ambitious
plan
of
operations
was
proposed
to
him
berthier
explained
that
the
emperor
took
it
for
granted
that
ciudad
rodrigo
would
have
been
revictualled
for
three
months
before
october
and
that
the
army
of
portugal
would
have
received
the
cavalry
drafts
which
general
vandermaesen
was
bringing
from
the
north
when
these
had
arrived
marmont
would
have
men
present
with
the
colours
let
him
march
with
this
force
into
estremadura
pick
up
drouet
and
the
corps
which
should
be
placed
under
his
orders
and
lay
siege
to
elvas
soult
should
be
asked
to
find
him
cavalry
and
he
would
have
a
force
of
men
which
would
be
more
than
wellington
would
be
able
to
face
for
if
the
english
general
hurried
to
save
elvas
a
course
which
he
was
almost
bound
to
take
he
would
probably
leave
two
divisions
in
front
of
almeida
to
contain
dorsenne
and
the
army
of
the
north
though
he
would
pick
up
instead
the
corps
of
hill
which
had
so
long
been
lying
in
the
alemtejo
yet
he
would
still
have
no
more
than
men
of
all
nations
even
including
castaños
s
spanish
levies
this
would
not
be
enough
to
cope
with
french
if
wellington
fought
he
would
be
beaten
if
he
did
not
he
would
lose
elvas
the
most
important
fortress
of
portugal
this
is
the
only
movement
le
maréchal
which
can
bring
back
honour
to
our
arms
free
us
from
the
defensive
attitude
in
which
we
lie
strike
terror
into
the
english
and
take
us
a
step
forward
to
the
end
of
the
war
the
prospect
of
capturing
a
great
fortress
under
the
eyes
of
the
english
army
of
conquering
a
province
of
portugal
which
covers
our
army
of
the
south
of
uniting
to
your
forces
men
of
that
army
the
corps
and
the
cavalry
should
serve
you
as
incentives
for
glory
and
berthier
then
grants
that
it
is
just
possible
that
wellington
may
refuse
to
march
to
the
relief
of
elvas
and
reply
to
the
menace
against
that
fortress
by
invading
leon
and
falling
upon
dorsenne
who
would
be
too
weak
to
face
him
if
he
does
this
the
army
of
the
north
may
retire
first
to
salamanca
then
to
valladolid
then
even
to
burgos
at
the
latter
point
having
called
in
all
its
detachments
it
would
be
strong
and
able
to
contain
the
allied
forces
even
if
wellington
had
brought
forward
every
available
man
but
marmont
might
take
it
for
granted
that
his
adversary
would
do
nothing
of
the
kind
he
would
hurry
south
to
save
elvas
and
cover
his
base
at
lisbon
if
he
left
no
troops
behind
him
on
the
coa
dorsenne
should
dispatch
men
of
the
army
of
the
north
to
estremadura
and
bring
up
the
force
before
elvas
to
a
total
of
men
a
number
which
wellington
could
not
possibly
resist
elvas
must
infallibly
fall
only
one
caution
was
added
to
this
scheme
of
campaign
marmont
must
be
sure
that
wellington
had
not
a
at
almeida
or
any
other
place
near
ciudad
rodrigo
for
if
he
were
to
answer
the
french
movement
on
elvas
by
laying
formal
siege
to
rodrigo
dorsenne
would
not
be
strong
enough
to
prevent
him
from
taking
it
and
the
army
of
portugal
would
have
to
turn
back
to
the
rescue
from
its
distant
position
in
the
alemtejo
it
may
be
found
in
belmas
appendix
to
vol
pp
marmont
for
reasons
not
hard
to
divine
does
not
print
it
among
the
many
documents
containing
his
correspondence
with
the
emperor
which
appear
in
the
appendix
to
his
book
xv
vol
iv
see
above
this
last
caution
was
in
effect
a
fatal
block
to
the
whole
plan
for
marmont
during
the
el
bodon
campaign
had
heard
of
the
existence
of
wellington
s
at
villa
da
ponte
and
he
had
also
found
in
the
cantonments
of
the
and
divisions
a
stock
of
gabions
and
fascines
whose
preparation
could
only
mean
that
the
british
had
been
contemplating
regular
siege
operations
at
some
future
date
the
wood
and
wickerwork
had
been
burned
but
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
wellington
from
replacing
it
at
short
notice
the
destruction
of
these
stores
is
mentioned
in
marmont
s
iv
yet
even
if
marmont
had
not
been
aware
of
the
existence
of
dickson
s
guns
the
plan
proposed
to
him
was
not
so
tempting
at
a
second
as
at
a
first
glance
he
was
well
aware
that
such
parts
of
it
as
depended
on
the
loyal
of
his
colleagues
might
not
work
out
easily
would
not
soult
find
some
excuse
for
refusing
to
send
the
cavalry
from
andalusia
could
dorsenne
be
trusted
to
dispatch
men
to
the
alemtejo
if
he
discovered
that
wellington
had
left
no
serious
force
on
the
coa
and
even
if
he
did
show
such
an
unwonted
as
to
detach
two
of
his
divisions
to
such
a
distant
destination
would
they
get
up
in
time
for
the
crisis
for
if
wellington
marched
promptly
with
his
whole
army
by
alfayates
castello
branco
and
the
bridge
of
villa
velha
he
would
be
at
elvas
many
days
before
dorsenne
s
detachment
which
would
have
to
take
the
circuitous
route
by
bejar
the
bridge
of
almaraz
truxillo
merida
and
badajoz
supposing
that
the
whole
allied
army
came
down
from
the
north
and
picked
up
hill
and
castaños
it
would
consist
of
well
over
men
and
the
army
of
portugal
when
joined
by
girard
s
corps
would
only
make
men
if
soult
sent
his
cavalry
or
if
as
was
more
likely
he
found
some
excuse
for
refusing
his
could
men
lay
siege
to
a
fortress
and
at
the
same
time
provide
a
covering
force
strong
enough
to
fend
off
of
the
allies
if
they
tried
to
do
so
would
not
the
covering
force
be
beaten
in
all
probability
and
it
was
probable
that
wellington
would
come
to
save
elvas
with
every
available
man
for
he
knew
that
dorsenne
was
not
able
to
make
any
serious
irruption
into
northern
portugal
the
army
of
the
north
could
not
collect
more
than
men
for
field
operations
as
the
late
campaign
had
shown
and
such
a
force
destitute
of
stores
and
acting
at
short
notice
would
not
get
far
into
the
wilderness
of
the
devastated
beira
much
less
threaten
lisbon
these
arguments
in
all
probability
must
have
occurred
to
marmont
but
we
have
no
proof
that
he
used
them
in
his
reply
to
berthier
written
at
talavera
on
october
he
takes
another
line
he
reports
that
the
difficulties
of
supply
are
so
great
that
he
has
after
returning
from
the
relief
of
ciudad
rodrigo
dispersed
his
army
from
plasencia
to
toledo
he
is
beginning
to
collect
great
central
magazines
at
navalmoral
near
almaraz
which
will
serve
for
his
army
when
next
it
is
massed
either
for
offensive
or
defensive
purposes
meanwhile
till
the
magazines
are
formed
he
asks
for
the
emperor
s
leave
to
wait
with
his
troops
in
their
present
positions
wellington
he
thinks
can
do
nothing
serious
for
want
of
numbers
and
the
dispersion
of
his
army
into
cantonments
has
been
caused
by
the
difficulty
of
feeding
his
men
in
the
highlands
from
which
he
has
just
retired
if
nevertheless
he
tries
some
forward
movement
into
estremadura
the
army
of
portugal
is
well
placed
for
falling
on
him
in
the
valley
of
the
guadiana
as
for
offensive
plans
nothing
can
be
done
till
magazines
are
formed
but
he
hopes
to
submit
a
scheme
of
his
own
to
the
emperor
when
leave
has
been
granted
this
may
be
found
printed
in
belmas
vol
i
appendix
pp
but
meanwhile
napoleon
s
mind
had
swerved
away
from
the
scheme
for
an
attack
on
elvas
and
the
alemtejo
which
had
been
formulated
in
the
compiègne
dispatch
of
september
just
a
month
later
berthier
writes
by
his
orders
from
amsterdam
to
lay
down
a
wholly
new
plan
this
dispatch
of
october
contains
the
germ
of
the
great
central
error
which
was
to
make
possible
wellington
s
sudden
offensive
move
of
the
following
midwinter
and
the
capture
of
ciudad
rodrigo
the
exploit
which
was
to
be
the
of
the
whole
peninsular
war
suchet
had
now
started
upon
his
march
on
valencia
with
which
we
shall
deal
in
its
proper
place
he
had
made
a
good
commencement
but
had
been
brought
to
a
stand
before
the
walls
of
saguntum
the
spaniards
had
begun
to
reinforce
their
eastern
armies
and
the
emperor
realized
that
suchet
needed
support
therefore
the
army
of
wellington
ceased
for
a
moment
to
be
the
central
point
on
which
his
attention
was
fixed
le
principal
objet
aujourd
hui
est
valence
writes
berthier
in
obedience
to
his
master
s
changed
opinion
and
he
thereupon
instructs
marmont
that
the
army
of
the
centre
will
have
to
stretch
itself
eastward
to
cuenca
to
support
suchet
and
that
in
consequence
the
army
of
portugal
will
have
to
facilitate
the
task
of
the
king
of
spain
spare
troops
to
occupy
those
parts
of
new
castile
from
which
joseph
must
withdraw
men
for
the
expedition
to
the
valencian
border
this
was
but
the
beginning
of
the
scheme
which
was
to
end
by
distracting
a
great
body
of
marmont
s
host
to
the
shore
of
the
mediterranean
out
of
call
of
their
commander
as
we
shall
see
the
duke
of
ragusa
was
finally
ordered
to
make
such
a
huge
detachment
to
aid
suchet
that
wellington
at
last
got
his
opportunity
to
strike
when
the
army
of
portugal
was
so
lowered
in
numbers
that
it
could
not
hope
to
restrain
him
the
first
hint
came
in
the
orders
of
october
in
the
second
crucial
dispatch
that
of
november
marmont
is
told
not
only
that
he
will
have
to
facilitate
the
task
of
king
joseph
but
that
he
must
select
a
body
of
men
to
march
at
once
on
valencia
and
set
aside
more
to
keep
up
the
line
of
communication
with
the
expeditionary
force
we
are
informed
continues
berthier
that
the
english
army
has
sick
and
barely
men
with
the
colours
so
that
they
can
not
possibly
try
any
offensive
printed
in
appendix
to
marmont
s
vol
iv
pp
the
sick
have
grown
from
to
since
the
day
before
which
is
the
date
of
a
less
important
dispatch
in
which
marmont
had
been
warned
to
set
aside
men
only
for
the
valencian
expedition
because
wellington
is
absolutely
unable
to
strike
a
blow
this
is
a
typical
result
of
the
endeavour
to
conduct
the
peninsular
war
from
paris
as
head
quarters
on
the
wholly
false
hypothesis
that
wellington
s
army
is
reduced
to
a
skeleton
and
can
do
nothing
the
emperor
orders
his
lieutenant
to
detach
a
third
of
the
army
of
portugal
beyond
the
reach
of
recall
but
the
english
though
indeed
there
were
many
sick
had
not
but
exactly
men
with
the
colours
at
that
moment
not
to
speak
of
portuguese
of
whom
the
emperor
as
usual
took
no
account
in
his
calculations
wellington
had
been
patiently
waiting
for
months
for
the
moment
when
the
army
of
portugal
should
no
longer
be
able
to
contain
him
the
emperor
was
obliging
enough
to
provide
the
opportunity
in
december
and
when
montbrun
had
marched
with
two
divisions
of
foot
and
one
of
horse
to
the
other
side
of
the
peninsula
wellington
struck
suddenly
and
successfully
the
movements
of
marmont
s
army
towards
toledo
to
aid
suchet
as
is
supposed
have
induced
us
to
make
preparations
for
the
siege
of
ciudad
rodrigo
wrote
wellington
on
the
of
that
month
on
the
of
january
the
place
was
invested
on
the
it
fell
and
then
followed
in
rapid
succession
all
the
triumphs
of
there
were
other
circumstances
to
be
mentioned
in
their
due
place
which
facilitated
wellington
s
advance
but
the
departure
of
montbrun
s
men
for
valencia
by
the
emperor
s
direct
command
was
the
main
governing
fact
it
is
impossible
to
deny
assent
to
marmont
s
bitter
criticism
on
the
orders
that
kept
coming
to
him
during
the
autumn
and
early
winter
of
napoleon
was
at
this
period
living
in
a
world
created
by
his
own
imagination
he
built
structures
in
the
air
he
took
his
desires
for
realities
and
gave
orders
as
if
ignorant
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
as
if
the
actual
facts
had
been
purposely
hidden
from
him
it
was
no
use
to
tell
him
that
magazines
were
that
numbers
were
low
that
roads
were
impracticable
that
communications
were
intercepted
that
he
had
undervalued
the
enemy
s
forces
he
continued
with
all
serenity
to
ignore
tiresome
hindrances
and
to
issue
orders
grounded
on
data
many
weeks
old
often
on
data
which
had
never
been
true
at
any
moment
but
which
it
suited
him
to
believe
and
so
the
catastrophe
of
came
nearer
to
be
exact

marmont

dorsenne
down
to

there
still
remains
to
be
told
the
story
of
the
autumn

in
the
secondary
fields
of

the
doings
of

in

have
been

further
than
july

august

returning
from
the
relief

freed
seville
from

menaces
of

forced

has
anything
been

lay
opposite

and
the
french

from

to

these
subsidiary
affairs
we
now
have
to
deal
see
pp
above
soult
s
victorious
campaign
on
the
border
of
murcia
and
the
flight
of
freire
s
army
homewards
had
reaffirmed
the
french
domination
in
eastern
andalusia
to
the
extent
that
the
large
towns
and
the
main
lines
of
communication
were
again
safe
but
the
alpujarras
were
still
in
arms
and
ballasteros
was
giving
much
trouble
from
his
new
base
in
the
extreme
south
excited
by
his
presence
the
serranos
of
the
sierra
de
ronda
spread
their
incursions
on
every
side
as
far
as
osuna
and
marbella
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
godinot
who
had
been
told
off
to
crush
them
the
strength
of
ballasteros
s
position
was
that
he
had
behind
him
two
secure
places
of
refuge
the
old
spanish
lines
in
front
of
gibraltar
with
the
great
fortress
behind
them
and
thirty
miles
away
the
stronghold
of
tarifa
which
had
been
held
since
the
late
winter
by
a
detachment
of
the
british
garrison
of
gibraltar
avoiding
serious
combats
and
confining
his
ambition
to
the
surprise
of
small
posts
and
the
cutting
off
of
detachments
ballasteros
made
himself
such
a
nuisance
to
the
french
that
soult
at
last
prepared
a
great
combined
scheme
for
surrounding
him
godinot
s
force
operating
from
the
north
was
to
work
in
unison
with
two
other
columns
under
generals
barrois
and
sémelé
sent
out
by
victor
from
the
lines
in
front
of
cadiz
the
concentric
advance
only
succeeded
in
driving
ballasteros
southward
not
in
trapping
him
he
evacuated
san
roque
and
algesiras
and
went
under
the
protection
of
the
cannon
of
gibraltar
from
which
secure
position
he
defied
the
enemy
october
for
a
moment
french
lay
before
the
english
fortress
but
they
had
not
come
prepared
for
a
siege
and
soon
departed
when
their
provisions
failed
godinot
then
made
a
dash
at
the
much
weaker
walls
of
tarifa
but
was
caught
on
the
march
along
the
seaside
road
the
only
one
that
cannon
could
take
by
a
squadron
of
british
warships
which
did
him
so
much
damage
that
he
drew
off
inland
without
even
reaching
his
objective
october
meanwhile
ballasteros
slipping
out
from
under
the
cover
of
gibraltar
the
moment
that
his
enemy
was
gone
followed
sémelé
s
column
which
was
returning
to
the
cadiz
lines
by
a
separate
route
and
surprised
it
at
bornos
november
the
french
men
of
the
léger
cut
their
way
through
the
enemy
with
the
loss
of
only
men
but
a
battalion
which
was
accompanying
them
threw
up
the
butts
of
its
muskets

was
incensed
at
the
failure
of
his
great
combined
movement
and
laid
the
blame
on
godinot
who
after
a
stormy
interview
with
his
chief
at
seville
committed
suicide
the
chase
of
ballasteros
began
again
with
a
new
set
of
hunters
but
as
we
shall
see
in
a
later
chapter
was
destined
to
prove
fruitless
nor
did
a
serious
attempt
to
beleaguer
tarifa
with
a
heavy
come
to
any
good
but
its
siege
though
commenced
in
the
last
days
of
the
old
year
belongs
rather
to
the
campaign
of
and
will
be
dealt
with
in
the
next
volume
of
this
work
there
remains
only
to
be
considered
the
state
of
affairs
in
estremadura
where
we
left
hill
with
his
two
divisions
facing
drouet
and
the
corps
in
july
their
forces
were
not
unequal
and
each
had
been
given
by
his
commander
a
defensive
rather
than
an
offensive
rôle
soult
had
directed
drouet
to
see
that
badajoz
was
not
molested
to
keep
up
communication
via
truxillo
with
the
armies
of
portugal
and
the
centre
and
to
risk
nothing
if
the
allies
detached
more
troops
into
the
alemtejo
he
was
to
make
no
attempt
to
face
superior
numbers
but
to
call
without
delay
for
help
to
his
neighbours
and
to
retire
on
merida
or
on
monasterio
as
seemed
more
suitable
at
the
moment
but
it
was
judged
unlikely
that
wellington
would
be
able
to
make
any
serious
detachment
southward
so
long
as
he
was
contained
by
the
army
of
portugal
which
lay
in
the
valley
of
the
tagus
ready
to
move
towards
ciudad
rodrigo
on
the
one
hand
or
badajoz
on
the
other
as
necessity
might
dictate
meanwhile
here
as
everywhere
else
in
western
spain
the
french
had
completely
abandoned
the
offensive
and
their
plans
contemplated
the
parrying
of
wellington
s
strokes
rather
than
the
delivery
of
any
blows
of
their
own
the
scheme
for
an
attack
on
the
alemtejo
which
napoleon
had
suggested
to
marmont
was
never
within
any
measurable
distance
of
being
put
into
practical
operation
by
this
time
the
only
part
of
the
peninsula
in
which
the
imperial
armies
retained
an
offensive
posture
was
the
east
coast
suchet
had
started
on
that
valencian
expedition
which
was
to
have
such
brilliant
success
in
itself
but
was
to
indirectly
destroy
the
french
hold
on
spain
by
calling
away
troops
from

wellington

the
critical
moment

the
midwinter

the
convalescents
of
the
albuera
wounded
and
six
regiments
of
cavalry
from
the
army
of
the
south
bringing
up
his
force
to
much
the
same
figure
see
above
pp
hill
s
orders
from
wellington
corresponded
very
closely
to
drouet
s
orders
from
soult
that
is
to
say
hill
was
to
content
himself
with
containing
the
french
force
opposite
him
to
see
that
elvas
and
campo
mayor
were
covered
to
make
no
attempt
on
badajoz
and
to
apply
for
aid
to
his
chief
in
the
event
of
an
increase
of
the
hostile
force
on
the
guadiana
the
summing
up
of
the
situation
in
the
original
dispatch
which
wellington
wrote
to
hill
when
he
left
for
the
north
is
simply
that
the
force
in
estremadura
must
pair
off
against
drouet
my
wish
is
that
you
should
observe
the
movements
of
the
corps
if
the
corps
should
move
off
to
cross
the
tagus
at
almaraz
you
will
then
march
to
cross
the
tagus
at
villa
velha
and
proceed
on
by
castello
branco
to
join
this
the
main
army
if
the
corps
should
instead
of
crossing
the
tagus
manœuvre
upon
you
in
alemtejo
i
request
you
to
move
upon
portalegre
and
there
either
stand
their
attack
or
not
as
you
may
think
proper
according
to
your
notion
of
their
force
as
compared
with
your
own
if
you
can
not
stand
their
attack
you
will
retire
by
gavião
towards
abrantes
and
thence
across
the
zezere
taking
the
line
of
the
tagus
with
santarem
on
your
right
it
being
possible
though
not
likely
that
marmont
might
make
an
advance
against
the
central
portuguese
frontier
north
of
the
tagus
from
the
zarza
la
mayor
and
coria
district
hill
was
directed
to
keep
one
british
and
one
portuguese
brigade
in
the
direction
of
castello
branco
as
a
nucleus
on
which
troops
coming
from
north
and
south
might
concentrate
for
serious
opposition
to
an
invasion
this
precautionary
move
was
made
in
august
and
the
detachment
remained
north
of
the
tagus
till
september
when
foy
s
removal
from
truxillo
and
marmont
s
march
to
the
relief
of
ciudad
rodrigo
showed
that
there
was
no
longer
any
possible
danger
in
this
direction
meanwhile
the
main
body
of
the
allied
force
in
estremadura
lay
about
portalegre
villa
viçosa
and
santa
olalla
waiting
for
developments
of
the
enemy
s
plans
which
never
came
about
for
drouet
kept
very
quiet
generally
with
his
head
quarters
at
zafra
and
a
strong
detachment
at
merida
as
anxiously
expectant
of
hill
s
movements
as
hill
was
of
his
wellington
to
hill
august
viii
pp
see
for
the
recall
the
dispatch
of
october
viii
p
all
this
time
the
space
to
the
north
of
hill
s
cantonments
was
occupied
by
the
small
remains
of
the
spanish
army
of
estremadura
still
under
castaños
since
the
had
sent
off
carlos
de
españa
to
the
borders
of
leon
he
remained
with
the
rest
of
his
troops
in
the
hilly
region
between
the
guadiana
and
the
tagus
with
his
head
quarters
at
valencia
de
alcantara
and
part
of
his
infantry
in
albuquerque
which
fortress
he
was
engaged
in
repairing
his
advance
lay
at
caçeres
observing
the
french
garrison
in
truxillo
with
which
it
often
bickered
but
castaños
occasionally
sent
a
flying
column
out
under
morillo
or
penne
villemur
to
beat
up
the
cantonments
of
the
corps
south
of
the
tagus
they
ranged
as
far
as
la
serena
and
the
sierra
del
pedroso
and
on
one
occasion
got
even
to
benalcazar
on
the
very
border
of
andalusia
whose
garrison
morillo
surprised
and
captured
such
raids
were
profitable
for
distracting
the
enemy
and
gave
drouet
much
trouble
but
as
castaños
s
whole
force
did
not
amount
to
much
more
than
horse
and
foot
the
menace
was
not
a
serious
one
in
the
thinly
peopled
region
of
northern
estremadura
it
was
impossible
to
get
recruits
to
fill
the
old
cadres
and
the
army
did
not
grow
as
the
commander
had
hoped
the
regiments
remained
mere
skeletons
for
copious
details
see
the
of
by
don
antonio
villa
pp
madrid
the
removal
of
foy
s
division
from
truxillo
in
september
when
marmont
drew
him
in
to
in
the
relief
of
ciudad
rodrigo
had
serious
consequences
in
estremadura
it
will
be
remembered
that
when
the
campaign
of
el
bodon
was
over
the
army
of
portugal
did
not
send
back
any
detachment
to
reoccupy
truxillo
the
between
the
armies
of
portugal
and
of
the
south
the
responsibility
for
keeping
touch
was
thrown
on
to
drouet
who
had
already
quite
enough
ground
to
cover
with
his
men
but
he
was
forced
to
send
a
strong
detachment
northward
from
merida
or
his
communication
with
marmont
would
have
been
wholly
intercepted
by
morillo
s
habitual
raids
accordingly
girard
s
division
of
the
corps
was
moved
up
to
occupy
the
front
between
the
guadiana
and
the
tagus
leaving
the
whole
stretch
from
the
guadiana
southward
to
the
sierra
morena
held
by
only
one
division
that
of
claparéde
and
two
cavalry
brigades
at
the
breaking
up
of
the
corps
in
june
claparéde
took
over
gazan
s
old
division
in
the
corps
and
conroux
that
of
ruffin
in
the
corps
but
the
corps
battalions
were
not
all
redistributed
into
their
regiments
till
conroux
came
back
from
soult
s
campaign
against
the
murcians
in
august
wellington
seeing
the
weakness
of
drouet
and
knowing
that
soult
had
crushed
the
murcian
army
in
august
and
therefore
could
find
some
reinforcements
for
estremadura
if
he
should
please
was
for
some
time
under
the
belief
that
hill
would
see
new
troops
brought
up
against
him
from
the
south
he
reiterated
his
old
orders
if
you
only
had
cavalry
you
certainly
have
infantry
in
sufficient
numbers
to
beat
the
corps
out
of
estremadura
but
your
cavalry
is
not
sufficiently
strong
i
think
however
that
you
are
able
to
prevent
the
corps
from
doing
anything
even
though
soult
should
add
to
it
another
division
you
must
proceed
with
great
caution
and
endeavour
to
have
the
best
intelligence
of
the
force
soult
brings
with
him
canton
your
troops
as
soon
as
you
find
the
enemy
are
serious
in
their
advance
upon
badajoz
nearly
on
the
ground
which
we
occupied
with
the
army
in
the
end
of
june
and
the
beginning
of
july
the
caya
position
if
you
should
find
soult
collects
in
too
great
force
for
you
retire
upon
portalegre
and
thence
if
necessary
upon
gavião
and
abrantes
it
appears
to
me
however
scarcely
possible
for
soult
to
bring
such
a
force
as
to
be
able
to
attack
you
at
campo
mayor
or
to
cut
your
communications
at
the
same
time
both
with
elvas
and
with
portalegre
if
soult
should
bring
a
large
army
into
estremadura
with
the
view
to
enable
the
army
of
portugal
to
in
the
invasion
of
valencia
i
shall
reinforce
your
corps
with
some
infantry
and
nearly
all
my
cavalry
and
i
think
we
shall
soon
have
back
again
the
army
of
portugal
if
soult
comes
only
to
throw
provisions
into
badajoz
i
am
afraid
we
can
not
prevent
it
under
existing
circumstances
see
wellington
to
hill
october
and
october
viii
pp
and
wellington
to
hill
from
freneda
october
viii
pp
soult
however
neither
came
in
person
to
estremadura
with
a
large
force
nor
even
drafted
another
division
into
the
province
to
succour
drouet
who
got
no
reinforcements
during
the
autumn
he
was
at
this
time
wrapped
up
in
the
internal
affairs
of
andalusia
and
had
no
intention
of
sending
troops
away
unless
there
was
urgent
necessity
for
it
hill
therefore
seeing
that
the
corps
had
received
no
succours
and
remained
spread
out
on
the
long
front
from
the
tagus
to
the
sierra
morena
while
its
two
divisions
were
not
in
supporting
distance
of
each
other
asked
for
leave
to
make
a
blow
at
girard
whose
position
was
decidedly
dangerous
because
of
his
remoteness
from
drouet
s
main
body
october
wellington
saw
the
opportunity
and
gave
instant
consent
i
should
approve
of
adopting
the
measure
which
should
be
effectual
and
should
drive
girard
from
caçeres
over
the
guadiana
if
you
think
you
can
do
it
without
risking
the
safety
of
campo
mayor
and
ouguella
it
appears
to
me
you
are
too
strong
for
girard
in
every
way
if
the
other
division
of
the
corps
has
not
crossed
the
guadiana
same
to
same
october
acknowledging
hill
s
proposal
made
in
a
letter
of
october
circumstances
were
at
this
moment
very
much
in
hill
s
favour
for
girard
seeking
new
regions
to
plunder
for
food
and
angered
by
the
raids
of
castaños
s
detachments
on
the
road
from
merida
to
truxillo
had
just
marched
to
drive
the
spaniards
back
sweeping
them
before
him
he
had
advanced
as
far
as
caçeres
fifty
miles
from
his
base
at
merida
and
was
raising
contributions
there
he
had
with
him
his
own
division
of
twelve
battalions
a
provisional
brigade
of
cavalry
under
general
bron
and
one
battery
in
all
about
foot
and
nearly
horse
hill
could
concentrate
against
him
a
much
larger
force
while
still
leaving
something
in
front
of
drouet
who
as
he
had
taken
pains
to
discover
was
cantoned
about
zafra
with
the
rest
of
his
corps
claparéde
s
division
and
the
bulk
of
the
cavalry
he
was
not
in
a
position
to
accomplish
anything
against
campo
mayor
or
elvas
for
his
troops
were
scattered
over
the
and
he
showed
no
signs
of
any
intention
to
move
apparently
dragoons
hussars
on
october
hill
wrote
to
castaños
to
say
that
he
relied
on
the
help
of
morillo
s
infantry
and
villemur
s
cavalry
for
a
blow
at
girard
he
himself
would
bring
up
howard
s
and
wilson
s
late
abercrombie
s
brigades
of
the
division
nine
battalions
of
portuguese
and
long
s
cavalry
brigade
the
column
would
consist
of
british
and
portuguese
infantry
horse
and
two
batteries
to
this
castaños
could
add
about
infantry
and
horse
so
that
a
striking
force
of
men
would
be
collected
meanwhile
there
would
be
left
in
portugal
to
make
a
front
against
drouet
if
he
should
move
the
remaining
brigade
byng
s
of
the
division
four
battalions
and
two
cavalry
regiments
of
portuguese
and
a
british
cavalry
brigade
under
le
marchant
recently
arrived
from
home
which
lay
at
castello
branco
but
could
be
called
south
if
required
and
line
batts
each
from
hamilton
s
division
and
line
batts
each
and
caçadores
from
ashworth
s
brigade
this
was
the
brigade
composed
of
the
remnant
of
colborne
s
and
hoghton
s
old
regiments
viz
buffs
the
remainder
of
hamilton
s
division
and
line
and
the
and
cavalry
the
essential
part
of
hill
s
scheme
was
that
girard
should
be
attacked
and
brought
to
action
before
he
was
aware
that
there
was
anything
in
his
front
save
the
spaniards
whom
he
had
just
hunted
out
of
caçeres
if
he
were
to
discover
that
there
was
a
large
force
in
his
front
he
would
probably
retire
by
forced
marches
upon
merida
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
concentrate
the
striking
force
with
suddenness
and
to
move
it
with
the
greatest
possible
speed
on
october
the
three
infantry
and
one
cavalry
brigades
were
collected
at
portalegre
on
the
they
made
a
tremendous
march
thirty
miles
across
the
steep
sierra
de
san
mamed
to
the
spanish
fortress
of
albuquerque
here
hill
received
news
from
castaños
that
girard
was
still
at
caçeres
and
had
sent
out
flying
parties
to
arroyo
del
puerco
and
other
places
sweeping
the
for
food
the
allied
column
at
albuquerque
was
as
near
merida
as
the
enemy
and
had
every
chance
of
intercepting
him
if
he
continued
quiescent
morillo
and
penne
villemur
had
moved
to
aliseda
twenty
miles
from
albuquerque
and
could
join
the
british
force
next
day
on
the
hill
advanced
to
aliseda
and
casa
de
santillana
and
picked
up
the
spaniards
next
morning
penne
villemur
s
horse
drove
the
french
outposts
out
of
arroyo
del
puerco
when
girard
s
cavalry
screen
had
been
driven
in
hill
s
whole
column
made
a
night
march
to
malpartida
only
eight
miles
from
caçeres
but
learnt
after
some
delays
on
the
morning
of
the
that
girard
had
left
caçeres
on
the
preceding
afternoon
by
the
torremocha
road
making
a
leisurely
journey
towards
merida
he
had
just
received
vague
rumours
that
there
was
an
force
coming
from
portugal
and
thought
it
well
to
draw
near
to
his
base
thus
hill
s
precautions
had
not
been
altogether
successful
girard
s
departure
was
tiresome
to
hill
as
the
to
malpartida
had
taken
the
allied
columns
too
far
to
the
north
and
the
enemy
was
now
between
them
and
his
own
base
but
if
it
was
too
late
to
intercept
him
there
was
still
time
to
pursue
and
overtake
him
unless
he
should
chance
to
quicken
his
pace
before
dawn
on
the
morning
of
the
hill
turned
his
face
southward
and
marched
on
torremocha
but
when
he
had
reached
the
pass
of
trasquillon
he
was
informed
by
the
peasantry
that
girard
had
left
torremocha
marching
for
arroyo
dos
molinos
on
the
other
side
of
the
sierra
de
montanches
the
general
called
on
his
troops
to
make
a
final
effort
if
girard
halted
at
arroyo
dos
molinos
it
was
possible
to
cut
him
off
by
continuing
the
long
march
the
men
responded
well
to
the
appeal
and
by
nightfall
on
the
the
two
british
brigades
were
at
alcuescar
five
miles
of
the
camp
of
the
french
and
the
portuguese
and
spaniards
close
behind
at
don
antonio
girard
had
only
gone
twelve
miles
that
day
the
allies
no
less
than
in
abominable
weather
across
two
rough
mountain
ranges
it
is
astonishing
that
the
french
general
had
not
made
more
haste
and
still
more
so
that
with
three
cavalry
regiments
for
reconnoitring
he
had
not
hit
upon
the
track
of
the
allies
bron
was
evidently
a
poor
director
of
cavalry
his
men
should
have
sufficed
to
sweep
the
whole
but
it
is
said
that
girard
was
convinced
that
hill
had
gone
to
caçeres
and
would
listen
to
no
warnings
hill
in
his
dispatch
says
that
the
peasantry
gave
girard
no
news
of
his
approach
but
in
blakeney
s
interesting
narrative
of
this
campaign
there
is
a
story
told
that
two
warned
the
frenchman
of
hill
s
approach
and
that
he
refused
to
credit
them
this
was
told
to
blakeney
by
his
prisoner
colonel
the
prince
of
aremberg
commanding
the
see
blakeney
at
two
o
clock
on
the
morning
of
the
the
weather
was
still
tempestuous
as
it
had
been
for
the
last
hours
and
hill
covered
by
the
driving
rain
marched
in
the
dark
on
arroyo
dos
molinos
and
covered
the
five
miles
which
separated
his
comfortless
bivouac
from
the
french
head
quarters
without
meeting
a
single
hostile
vedette
he
was
able
to
arrange
his
force
within
half
a
mile
of
the
little
town
undiscovered
and
to
make
his
provisions
for
blocking
all
the
three
roads
by
which
girard
might
escape
arroyo
dos
molinos
lies
under
the
shoulder
of
the
precipitous
sierra
de
montanches
with
no
track
going
directly
northwards
from
it
but
with
country
roads
to
truxillo
medellin
and
merida
diverging
and
hill
directed
wilson
s
brigade
supported
by
three
portuguese
battalions
to
march
round
the
town
on
its
southward
side
and
block
the
truxillo
road
while
the
rest
of
the
infantry
should
attack
the
enemy
in
front
and
the
cavalry
both
english
and
spanish
should
form
a
central
column
which
should
seize
the
merida
and
medellin
roads
and
prevent
the
escape
of
girard
southward
not
a
frenchman
was
seen
till
howard
s
brigade
leading
the
advance
of
the
main
body
ran
upon
a
picket
half
a
mile
outside
arroyo
the
men
huddling
together
under
trees
with
their
faces
away
from
the
driving
rain
and
the
approaching
enemy
most
of
them
were
captured
but
some
escaped
to
warn
girard
who
till
this
moment
had
no
knowledge
that
a
british
column
was
within
striking
distance
of
him
as
it
chanced
the
french
general
had
been
preparing
to
start
early
and
remond
s
brigades
the
and
of
the
line
escorted
by
one
cavalry
regiment
had
marched
an
hour
before
on
the
merida
road
and
were
now
three
miles
away
girard
had
not
therefore
even
his
whole
force
assembled
but
only
the
six
battalions
of
dombrouski
s
brigade
and
of
the
line
two
cavalry
regiments
and
half
a
battery
with
him
not
more
than
men
while
of
the
allies
were
converging
upon
him
from
three
separate
quarters
at
the
moment
when
the
first
shots
were
heard
on
the
alcuescar
road
his
infantry
was
just
getting
ready
to
march
his
baggage
and
a
rearguard
of
one
battalion
were
still
in
the
street
of
arroyo
dos
molinos
many
of
his
horsemen
had
not
yet
saddled
up
and
he
himself
was
breakfasting
in
the
alcaide
s
house
the
regiments
which
were
incomplete
in
july
see
appendix
xviii
had
been
joined
before
october
by
the
battalion
which
each
had
contributed
to
the
garrison
of
badajoz
within
a
few
minutes
of
the
first
alarm
the
and
at
the
head
of
howard
s
brigade
burst
into
the
little
town
drove
out
the
battalion
that
was
holding
it
and
captured
the
whole
of
girard
s
baggage
and
many
prisoners
general
bron
was
taken
in
the
doorway
of
the
house
which
he
had
been
occupying
just
as
he
was
about
to
mount
hurrying
out
on
the
other
side
of
the
place
the
advancing
british
found
dombrouski
s
brigade
hastily
forming
up
for
the
march
girard
had
ordered
an
instant
retreat
along
the
merida
road
the
formation
of
his
troops
was
soon
disordered
by
the
fire
of
the
advancing
followed
by
that
of
three
guns
of
arriaga
s
battery
which
galloped
out
to
the
town
end
and
opened
on
the
nearest
regiment
the
column
however
started
off
and
had
gone
a
little
way
when
it
discovered
the
allied
cavalry
advancing
along
the
merida
road
to
meet
it
penne
villemur
in
front
long
in
support
girard
seeing
this
road
blocked
bade
his
and
dragoons
hold
off
the
british
and
spanish
horse
at
all
costs
and
turned
the
infantry
column
towards
the
truxillo
road
which
skirts
the
precipitous
foot
of
the
sierra
de
montanches
his
cavalry
became
engaged
in
a
confused
fight
first
with
penne
villemur
s
spaniards
and
then
with
the
light
dragoons
and
the
hussars
of
the
king
s
german
legion
being
outnumbered
they
were
soon
broken
many
were
taken
and
the
rest
scattered
and
tried
to
get
off
in
small
parties
the
infantry
making
the
best
speed
that
it
could
but
closely
pursued
by
howard
s
regiments
and
the
spanish
brigade
in
their
rear
finally
reached
the
spot
where
the
truxillo
road
turns
the
corner
of
the
sierra
a
mile
and
a
half
outside
arroyo
dos
molinos
by
this
time
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
mists
dispersing
showed
the
frenchmen
wilson
s
brigade
marching
hard
to
cut
them
off
and
less
than
half
a
mile
away
both
parties
started
to
run
and
the
three
light
companies
of
the
and
who
were
well
ahead
of
their
regiments
reached
the
road
just
as
the
leading
french
battalion
was
pushing
across
their
front
only
men
were
up
but
blakeney
commanding
the
company
saw
that
if
the
hostile
column
were
closely
attacked
in
flank
even
by
a
small
body
its
progress
would
be
stopped
and
a
few
minutes
delay
would
bring
down
both
wilson
s
and
howard
s
brigades
upon
it
accordingly
he
led
in
person
the
charge
of
some
scores
of
the
men
nearest
him
against
the
throat
of
the
french
column
they
were
not
exterminated
as
might
have
been
expected
for
girard
who
was
present
at
the
spot
told
his
men
not
to
stop
to
fight
but
to
escape
by
leaving
the
road
and
dashing
uphill
along
the
rocks
of
the
sierra
above
he
himself
with
the
leading
companies
got
clear
hitting
on
a
place
where
the
side
of
the
precipice
was
not
too
steep
to
climb
though
the
officers
had
to
turn
loose
their
horses
before
they
could
start
on
the
scramble
the
main
body
of
the
column
was
less
lucky
an
absolutely
impassable
line
of
cliffs
was
above
them
and
after
reaching
its
foot
a
thousand
men
in
two
or
three
disorderly
masses
had
to
halt
and
lay
down
their
arms
to
the
eager
pursuers
from
both
the
british
brigades
who
were
converging
upon
them
a
few
got
away
by
incredibly
dangerous
climbing
and
joined
girard
on
top
of
the
sierra
meanwhile
morillo
s
spanish
infantry
had
taken
an
easier
path
up
the
heights
far
to
the
left
and
started
in
pursuit
of
the
remnants
of
the
french
they
kept
up
the
chase
for
eight
leagues
and
took
or
slew
many
stragglers
but
girard
dombrouski
and
four
or
five
hundred
men
bearing
with
them
the
eagles
of
the
and
escaped
eastward
and
after
much
wandering
in
the
mountains
crossed
the
guadiana
at
orellana
beyond
medellin
and
got
back
to
join
drouet
other
small
parties
and
many
of
the
cavalry
straggled
in
later
but
girard
s
force
had
practically
been
destroyed
nearly
prisoners
had
been
taken
including
general
bron
commanding
the
cavalry
the
prince
of
aremberg
colonel
of
the
the
d
état
of
the
corps
and
more
than
thirty
other
officers
in
addition
the
french
lost
their
three
guns
and
a
contribution
of
dollars
levied
on
caçeres
a
few
days
before
hill
s
loss
was
insignificant
seven
men
killed
and
seven
officers
and
men
wounded
penne
villemur
s
spaniards
who
had
behaved
with
excellent
spirit
had
about
thirty
casualties
blakeney
s
account
of
his
own
exploit
pp
of
his
book
is
borne
out
by
hill
s
recommendation
of
him
though
he
is
not
mentioned
in
the
formal
dispatch
of
october
this
rheinbund
prince
had
been
in
great
favour
with
napoleon
and
married
stephanie
tascher
niece
of
the
empress
josephine
he
had
raised
the
at
his
own
cost
after
the
fighting
was
over
hill
directed
long
s
cavalry
with
the
portuguese
regiments
who
had
not
been
engaged
to
march
on
merida
supporting
them
with
howard
s
brigade
when
it
had
rested
it
was
hoped
that
remond
s
column
which
had
escaped
the
disaster
of
arroyo
dos
molinos
by
its
early
march
might
be
caught
up
but
the
french
brigadier
had
a
long
enough
start
to
render
this
impossible
warned
by
fugitive
cavalry
of
the
fate
of
his
chief
he
marched
through
merida
without
halting
and
retired
towards
drouet
by
way
of
almendralejo
hill
after
following
his
vanguard
to
merida
on
the
and
stopping
there
two
days
returned
by
wellington
s
orders
to
his
old
cantonments
at
portalegre
which
he
reached
on
november
it
would
have
been
useless
wrote
wellington
for
him
to
push
on
his
operations
beyond
the
guadiana
for
drouet
would
simply
have
retired
before
him
and
equally
so
to
remain
at
by
this
somewhat
cryptic
phrase
the
british
meant
that
if
he
had
chosen
to
direct
hill
after
his
success
at
arroyo
dos
molinos
to
march
against
drouet
s
main
body
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
he
might
have
driven
it
into
the
sierra
morena
this
would
have
caused
soult
to
come
to
its
aid
with
all
the
available
troops
that
could
be
collected
in
andalusia
the
reason
why
no
such
orders
were
issued
was
that
the
british
general
did
not
wish
to
provoke
soult
to
concentrate
hill
could
do
nothing
against
the
army
of
the
south
if
it
came
against
him
in
force
but
if
it
continued
disseminated
through
all
the
four
kingdoms
of
andalusia
as
it
was
at
present
with
one
mass
of
troops
opposite
cadiz
another
at
granada
and
the
small
available
field
force
busily
engaged
in
hunting
ballasteros
it
was
not
to
be
feared
as
to
the
uselessness
of
stopping
at
merida
wellington
meant
that
hill
if
posted
there
would
have
been
liable
to
be
cut
off
from
elvas
if
soult
should
come
up
in
haste
from
andalusia
to
reinforce
drouet
as
was
extremely
likely
wellington
was
contented
with
having
broken
up
a
french
division
and
cut
the
communication
between
the
armies
of
the
south
and
of
portugal
for
a
time
for
when
girard
was
driven
out
of
the
space
between
the
tagus
and
the
guadiana
soult
could
no
longer
communicate
with
marmont
napoleon
recalled
girard
in
disgrace
which
he
well
deserved
for
his
reckless
want
of
caution
his
maltreated
division
was
given
to
general
barrois
but
he
was
afterwards
pardoned
and
survived
to
die
still
a
general
of
division
doing
good
service
at
the
battle
of
ligny
in
the
first
moment
of
alarm
after
hearing
of
girard
s
disaster
soult
had
expected
to
be
pressed
had
sent
infantry
to
reinforce
drouet
and
had
begun
to
collect
other
troops
at
seville
but
finding
that
hill
had
no
further
intention
of
striking
at
the
corps
and
that
badajoz
was
not
even
threatened
he
reverted
to
his
earlier
plans
left
estremadura
alone
and
continued
to
hunt
ballasteros
and
to
make
preparation
for
his
next
important
move
the
siege
of
tarifa
drouet
for
his
part
having
recovered
from
the
dismay
into
which
girard
s
defeat
had
thrown
him
once
more
began
to
move
his
troops
northward
with
caution
on
december
he
reoccupied
almendralejo
on
the
he
pushed
dombrouski
with
a
brigade
to
merida
and
once
more
opened
up
communication
with
the
army
of
portugal
by
way
of
truxillo
but
the
road
was
not
to
be
long
open
just
before
the
year
was
out
december
hill
was
sent
forth
a
second
time
against
the
corps
with
far
more
serious
intentions
than
in
october
for
this
expedition
was
part
of
wellington
s
preliminary
movements
for
the
siege
of
ciudad
rodrigo

proper
place

intents

purposes
the
march
to
arroyo
dos
molinos
forms
the
last
episode
of
the
campaign
of
its
main
interest
was
that
it
showed
wellington
in
offensive
mood
ready
to
take
advantage
of
the
scattered
condition
of
his
enemy
it
also
made
it
clear
that
in
hill
he
had
an
executive
officer
of
the
highest
merit
but
this
was
known
before
to
all
who
had
studied
the
career
of
that
and
general
for
whom
the
division
would
do
anything
there
was
no
more
popular
promotion
during
the
whole
war
than
that
which
made
him
a
knight

campaign
