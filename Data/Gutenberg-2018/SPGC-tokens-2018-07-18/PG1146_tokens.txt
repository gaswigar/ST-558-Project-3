the
voyage
introduction
to
several
works
when
it
was
determined
to
extend
the
present
edition
of
fielding
not
merely
by
the
addition
of
jonathan
wild
to
the
three
universally
popular
novels
but
by
two
volumes
of
miscellanies
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
at
least
one
of
the
contents
of
these
latter
the
journal
of
a
voyage
to
lisbon
if
it
does
not
rank
in
my
estimation
anywhere
near
to
jonathan
wild
as
an
example
of
our
author
genius
is
an
invaluable
and
delightful
document
for
his
character
and
memory
it
is
indeed
as
has
been
pointed
out
in
the
general
introduction
to
this
series
our
main
source
of
indisputable
information
as
to
fielding
dans
son
naturel
and
its
value
so
far
as
it
goes
is
of
the
very
highest
the
gentle
and
unaffected
stoicism
which
the
author
displays
under
a
disease
which
he
knew
well
was
probably
if
not
certainly
mortal
and
which
whether
mortal
or
not
must
cause
him
much
actual
pain
and
discomfort
of
a
kind
more
intolerable
than
pain
itself
his
affectionate
care
for
his
family
even
little
personal
touches
less
admirable
but
hardly
less
pleasant
than
these
showing
an
englishman
dislike
to
be
done
and
an
englishman
determination
to
be
treated
with
proper
respect
are
scarcely
less
noticeable
and
important
on
the
biographical
side
than
the
unimpaired
brilliancy
of
his
satiric
and
yet
kindly
observation
of
life
and
character
is
on
the
side
of
literature
there
is
as
is
now
well
known
since
dobson
separate
edition
of
the
voyage
a
little
bibliographical
problem
about
the
first
appearance
of
this
journal
in
the
best
known
issue
of
that
year
is
much
shorter
than
the
version
inserted
by
murphy
and
reprinted
here
the
passages
omitted
being
chiefly
those
reflecting
on
the
captain
and
so
likely
to
seem
invidious
in
a
book
published
just
after
the
author
death
and
for
the
benefit
as
was
expressly
announced
of
his
family
but
the
curious
thing
is
that
there
is
another
edition
of
date
so
early
that
some
argument
is
necessary
to
determine
the
priority
which
does
give
these
passages
and
is
identical
with
the
later
or
standard
version
for
satisfaction
on
this
point
however
i
must
refer
readers
to
dobson
himself
there
might
have
been
a
little
but
not
much
doubt
as
to
a
companion
piece
for
the
journal
for
indeed
after
we
close
this
with
or
without
its
fragment
on
bolingbroke
the
remainder
of
fielding
work
lies
on
a
distinctly
lower
level
of
interest
it
is
still
interesting
or
it
would
not
be
given
here
it
still
has
at
least
that
part
which
here
appears
seems
to
its
editor
to
have
interest
intrinsic
and
simple
of
itself
but
it
is
impossible
for
anybody
who
speaks
critically
to
deny
that
we
now
get
into
the
region
where
work
is
more
interesting
because
of
its
authorship
than
it
would
be
if
its
authorship
were
different
or
unknown
to
put
the
same
thing
in
a
sharper
antithesis
fielding
is
interesting
first
of
all
because
he
is
the
author
of
joseph
andrews
of
tom
jones
of
amelia
of
jonathan
wild
of
the
journal
his
plays
his
essays
his
miscellanies
generally
are
interesting
first
of
all
because
they
were
written
by
fielding
yet
of
these
works
the
journey
from
this
world
to
the
next
which
by
a
grim
trick
of
fortune
might
have
served
as
a
title
for
the
more
interesting
voyage
with
which
we
have
yoked
it
stands
clearly
first
both
in
scale
and
merit
it
is
indeed
very
unequal
and
as
the
author
was
to
leave
it
unfinished
it
is
a
pity
that
he
did
not
leave
it
unfinished
much
sooner
than
he
actually
did
the
first
ten
chapters
if
of
a
kind
of
satire
which
has
now
grown
rather
obsolete
for
the
nonce
are
of
a
good
kind
and
good
in
their
kind
the
history
of
the
metempsychoses
of
julian
is
of
a
less
good
kind
and
less
good
in
that
kind
the
date
of
composition
of
the
piece
is
not
known
but
it
appeared
in
the
miscellanies
of
and
may
represent
almost
any
period
of
its
author
development
prior
to
that
year
its
form
was
a
very
common
form
at
the
time
and
continued
to
be
so
i
do
not
know
that
it
is
necessary
to
assign
any
very
special
origin
to
it
though
lucian
its
chief
practitioner
was
evidently
and
almost
avowedly
a
favorite
study
of
fielding
the
spanish
romancers
whether
borrowing
it
from
lucian
or
not
had
been
fond
of
it
their
french
followers
of
whom
the
chief
were
fontenelle
and
le
sage
had
carried
it
northwards
the
english
essayists
had
almost
from
the
beginning
continued
the
process
of
acclimatization
fielding
therefore
found
it
ready
to
his
hand
though
the
present
condition
of
this
example
would
lead
us
to
suppose
that
he
did
not
find
his
hand
quite
ready
to
it
still
in
the
actual
journey
there
are
touches
enough
of
the
master
not
yet
quite
in
his
stage
of
mastery
it
seemed
particularly
desirable
not
to
close
the
series
without
some
representation
of
the
work
to
which
fielding
gave
the
prime
of
his
manhood
and
from
which
had
he
not
fortunately
for
english
literature
been
driven
decidedly
against
his
will
we
had
had
in
all
probability
no
joseph
andrews
and
pretty
certainly
no
tom
jones
fielding
periodical
and
dramatic
work
has
been
comparatively
seldom
reprinted
and
has
never
yet
been
reprinted
as
a
whole
the
dramas
indeed
are
open
to
two
objections
the
first
that
they
are
not
very
proper
the
second
and
much
more
serious
that
they
do
not
redeem
this
want
of
propriety
by
the
possession
of
any
remarkable
literary
merit
three
or
two
and
part
of
a
third
seemed
to
escape
this
double
censure
the
first
two
acts
of
the
author
farce
practically
a
piece
to
themselves
for
the
puppet
show
which
follows
is
almost
entirely
independent
the
famous
burlesque
of
tom
thumb
which
stands
between
the
rehearsal
and
the
critic
but
nearer
to
the
former
and
pasquin
the
maturest
example
of
fielding
satiric
work
in
drama
these
accordingly
have
been
selected
the
rest
i
have
read
and
he
who
likes
may
read
i
have
read
many
worse
things
than
even
the
worst
of
them
but
not
often
worse
things
by
so
good
a
writer
as
henry
fielding
the
next
question
concerned
the
selection
of
writings
more
miscellaneous
still
so
as
to
give
in
little
a
complete
idea
of
fielding
various
powers
and
experiments
two
difficulties
beset
this
part
of
the
task
want
of
space
and
the
absence
of
anything
so
markedly
good
as
absolutely
to
insist
on
inclusion
the
essay
on
conversation
however
seemed
pretty
peremptorily
to
challenge
a
place
it
is
in
a
style
which
fielding
was
very
slow
to
abandon
which
indeed
has
left
strong
traces
even
on
his
great
novels
and
if
its
mannerism
is
not
now
very
attractive
the
separate
traits
in
it
are
often
sharp
and
the
book
would
not
have
been
complete
without
a
specimen
or
two
of
fielding
journalism
the
champion
his
first
attempt
of
this
kind
has
not
been
drawn
upon
in
consequence
of
the
extreme
difficulty
of
fixing
with
absolute
certainty
on
fielding
part
in
it
i
do
not
know
whether
political
prejudice
interferes
more
than
i
have
usually
found
it
interfere
with
my
judgment
of
the
two
papers
of
the
time
but
they
certainly
seem
to
me
to
fail
in
redeeming
their
dose
of
rancor
and
misrepresentation
by
any
sufficient
evidence
of
genius
such
as
to
my
taste
saves
not
only
the
party
journalism
in
verse
and
prose
of
swift
and
canning
and
praed
on
one
side
but
that
of
wolcot
and
moore
and
sydney
smith
on
the
other
even
the
journal
of
events
in
london
under
the
chevalier
is
overwrought
and
tedious
the
best
thing
in
the
true
patriot
seems
to
me
to
be
parson
adams
letter
describing
his
adventure
with
a
young
bowe
of
his
day
and
this
i
select
together
with
one
or
two
numbers
of
the
covent
garden
journal
i
have
not
found
in
this
latter
anything
more
characteristic
than
murphy
selection
though
dobson
with
his
unfailing
kindness
lent
me
an
original
and
unusually
complete
set
of
the
journal
itself
it
is
to
the
same
kindness
that
i
owe
the
opportunity
of
presenting
the
reader
with
something
indisputably
fielding
and
very
characteristic
of
him
which
murphy
did
not
print
and
which
has
not
so
far
as
i
know
ever
appeared
either
in
a
collection
or
a
selection
of
fielding
work
after
the
success
of
david
simple
fielding
gave
his
sister
for
whom
he
had
already
written
a
preface
to
that
novel
another
preface
for
a
set
of
familiar
letters
between
the
characters
of
david
simple
and
others
this
preface
murphy
reprinted
but
he
either
did
not
notice
or
did
not
choose
to
attend
to
a
note
towards
the
end
of
the
book
attributing
certain
of
the
letters
to
the
author
of
the
preface
the
attribution
being
accompanied
by
an
agreeably
warm
and
sisterly
denunciation
of
those
who
ascribed
to
fielding
matter
unworthy
of
him
from
these
the
letter
which
i
have
chosen
describing
a
row
on
the
thames
seems
to
me
not
only
characteristic
but
like
all
this
miscellaneous
work
interesting
no
less
for
its
weakness
than
for
its
strength
in
hardly
any
other
instance
known
to
me
can
we
trace
so
clearly
the
influence
of
a
suitable
medium
and
form
on
the
genius
of
the
artist
there
are
some
writers
dryden
is
perhaps
the
greatest
of
them
to
whom
form
and
medium
seem
almost
indifferent
their
craftsmanship
being
such
that
they
can
turn
any
kind
and
every
style
to
their
purpose
there
are
others
of
whom
i
think
our
present
author
is
the
chief
who
are
never
really
at
home
but
in
one
kind
in
fielding
case
that
kind
was
narrative
of
a
peculiar
sort
and
almost
wholly
sympathetic
narrative
which
has
the
singular
gift
of
portraying
the
liveliest
character
and
yet
of
admitting
the
widest
disgression
and
soliloquy
until
comparatively
late
in
his
too
short
life
when
he
found
this
special
path
of
his
and
it
is
impossible
to
say
whether
the
actual
finding
was
in
the
case
of
jonathan
or
in
the
case
of
joseph
he
did
but
flounder
and
slip
when
he
had
found
it
and
was
content
to
walk
in
it
he
strode
with
as
sure
and
steady
a
step
as
any
other
even
the
greatest
of
those
who
carry
and
hand
on
the
torch
of
literature
through
the
ages
but
it
is
impossible
to
derive
full
satisfaction
from
his
feats
in
this
part
of
the
race
without
some
notion
of
his
performances
elsewhere
and
i
believe
that
such
a
notion
will
be
supplied
to
the
readers
of
his
novels
by
the
following
volumes
in
a
very
large
number
of
cases
for
the
first
time
the
journal
of
a
voyage
to
lisbon
dedication
to
the
public
your
candor
is
desired
on
the
perusal
of
the
following
sheets
as
they
are
the
product
of
a
genius
that
has
long
been
your
delight
and
entertainment
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
a
lamp
almost
burnt
out
does
not
give
so
steady
and
uniform
a
light
as
when
it
blazes
in
its
full
vigor
but
yet
it
is
well
known
that
by
its
wavering
as
if
struggling
against
its
own
dissolution
it
sometimes
darts
a
ray
as
bright
as
ever
in
like
manner
a
strong
and
lively
genius
will
in
its
last
struggles
sometimes
mount
aloft
and
throw
forth
the
most
striking
marks
of
its
original
luster
wherever
these
are
to
be
found
do
you
the
genuine
patrons
of
extraordinary
capacities
be
as
liberal
in
your
applauses
of
him
who
is
now
no
more
as
you
were
of
him
whilst
he
was
yet
amongst
you
and
on
the
other
hand
if
in
this
little
work
there
should
appear
any
traces
of
a
weakened
and
decayed
life
let
your
own
imaginations
place
before
your
eyes
a
true
picture
in
that
of
a
hand
trembling
in
almost
its
latest
hour
of
a
body
emaciated
with
pains
yet
struggling
for
your
entertainment
and
let
this
affecting
picture
open
each
tender
heart
and
call
forth
a
melting
tear
to
blot
out
whatever
failings
may
be
found
in
a
work
begun
in
pain
and
finished
almost
at
the
same
period
with
life
it
was
thought
proper
by
the
friends
of
the
deceased
that
this
little
piece
should
come
into
your
hands
as
it
came
from
the
hands
of
the
author
it
being
judged
that
you
would
be
better
pleased
to
have
an
opportunity
of
observing
the
faintest
traces
of
a
genius
you
have
long
admired
than
have
it
patched
by
a
different
hand
by
which
means
the
marks
of
its
true
author
might
have
been
effaced
that
the
success
of
the
last
written
though
first
published
volume
of
the
posthumous
pieces
may
be
attended
with
some
convenience
to
those
innocents
he
hath
left
behind
will
no
doubt
be
a
motive
to
encourage
its
circulation
through
the
kingdom
which
will
engage
every
future
genius
to
exert
itself
for
your
pleasure
the
principles
and
spirit
which
breathe
in
every
line
of
the
small
fragment
begun
in
answer
to
lord
bolingbroke
will
unquestionably
be
a
sufficient
apology
for
its
publication
although
vital
strength
was
wanting
to
finish
a
work
so
happily
begun
and
so
well
designed
preface
there
would
not
perhaps
be
a
more
pleasant
or
profitable
study
among
those
which
have
their
principal
end
in
amusement
than
that
of
travels
or
voyages
if
they
were
wrote
as
they
might
be
and
ought
to
be
with
a
joint
view
to
the
entertainment
and
information
of
mankind
if
the
conversation
of
travelers
be
so
eagerly
sought
after
as
it
is
we
may
believe
their
books
will
be
still
more
agreeable
company
as
they
will
in
general
be
more
instructive
and
more
entertaining
but
when
i
say
the
conversation
of
travelers
is
usually
so
welcome
i
must
be
understood
to
mean
that
only
of
such
as
have
had
good
sense
enough
to
apply
their
peregrinations
to
a
proper
use
so
as
to
acquire
from
them
a
real
and
valuable
knowledge
of
men
and
things
both
which
are
best
known
by
comparison
if
the
customs
and
manners
of
men
were
everywhere
the
same
there
would
be
no
office
so
dull
as
that
of
a
traveler
for
the
difference
of
hills
valleys
rivers
in
short
the
various
views
of
which
we
may
see
the
face
of
the
earth
would
scarce
afford
him
a
pleasure
worthy
of
his
labor
and
surely
it
would
give
him
very
little
opportunity
of
communicating
any
kind
of
entertainment
or
improvement
to
others
to
make
a
traveler
an
agreeable
companion
to
a
man
of
sense
it
is
necessary
not
only
that
he
should
have
seen
much
but
that
he
should
have
overlooked
much
of
what
he
hath
seen
nature
is
not
any
more
than
a
great
genius
always
admirable
in
her
productions
and
therefore
the
traveler
who
may
be
called
her
commentator
should
not
expect
to
find
everywhere
subjects
worthy
of
his
notice
it
is
certain
indeed
that
one
may
be
guilty
of
omission
as
well
as
of
the
opposite
extreme
but
a
fault
on
that
side
will
be
more
easily
pardoned
as
it
is
better
to
be
hungry
than
surfeited
and
to
miss
your
dessert
at
the
table
of
a
man
whose
gardens
abound
with
the
choicest
fruits
than
to
have
your
taste
affronted
with
every
sort
of
trash
that
can
be
picked
up
at
the
or
the
if
we
should
carry
on
the
analogy
between
the
traveler
and
the
commentator
it
is
impossible
to
keep
eye
a
moment
off
from
the
laborious
doctor
zachary
gray
of
whose
redundant
notes
on
hudibras
i
shall
only
say
that
it
is
i
am
confident
the
single
book
extant
in
which
above
five
hundred
authors
are
quoted
not
one
of
which
could
be
found
in
the
collection
of
the
late
doctor
mead
as
there
are
few
things
which
a
traveler
is
to
record
there
are
fewer
on
which
he
is
to
offer
his
observations
this
is
the
office
of
the
reader
and
it
is
so
pleasant
a
one
that
he
seldom
chooses
to
have
it
taken
from
him
under
the
pretense
of
lending
him
assistance
some
occasions
indeed
there
are
when
proper
observations
are
pertinent
and
others
when
they
are
necessary
but
good
sense
alone
must
point
them
out
i
shall
lay
down
only
one
general
rule
which
i
believe
to
be
of
universal
truth
between
relator
and
hearer
as
it
is
between
author
and
reader
this
is
that
the
latter
never
forgive
any
observation
of
the
former
which
doth
not
convey
some
knowledge
that
they
are
sensible
they
could
not
possibly
have
attained
of
themselves
but
all
his
pains
in
collecting
knowledge
all
his
judgment
in
selecting
and
all
his
art
in
communicating
it
will
not
suffice
unless
he
can
make
himself
in
some
degree
an
agreeable
as
well
as
an
instructive
companion
the
highest
instruction
we
can
derive
from
the
tedious
tale
of
a
dull
fellow
scarce
ever
pays
us
for
our
attention
there
is
nothing
i
think
half
so
valuable
as
knowledge
and
yet
there
is
nothing
which
men
will
give
themselves
so
little
trouble
to
attain
unless
it
be
perhaps
that
lowest
degree
of
it
which
is
the
object
of
curiosity
and
which
hath
therefore
that
active
passion
constantly
employed
in
its
service
this
indeed
it
is
in
the
power
of
every
traveler
to
gratify
but
it
is
the
leading
principle
in
weak
minds
only
to
render
his
relation
agreeable
to
the
man
of
sense
it
is
therefore
necessary
that
the
voyager
should
possess
several
eminent
and
rare
talents
so
rare
indeed
that
it
is
almost
wonderful
to
see
them
ever
united
in
the
same
person
and
if
all
these
talents
must
concur
in
the
relator
they
are
certainly
in
a
more
eminent
degree
necessary
to
the
writer
for
here
the
narration
admits
of
higher
ornaments
of
style
and
every
fact
and
sentiment
offers
itself
to
the
fullest
and
most
deliberate
examination
it
would
appear
therefore
i
think
somewhat
strange
if
such
writers
as
these
should
be
found
extremely
common
since
nature
hath
been
a
most
parsimonious
distributor
of
her
richest
talents
and
hath
seldom
bestowed
many
on
the
same
person
but
on
the
other
hand
why
there
should
scarce
exist
a
single
writer
of
this
kind
worthy
our
regard
and
whilst
there
is
no
other
branch
of
history
for
this
is
history
which
hath
not
exercised
the
greatest
pens
why
this
alone
should
be
overlooked
by
all
men
of
great
genius
and
erudition
and
delivered
up
to
the
goths
and
vandals
as
their
lawful
property
is
altogether
as
difficult
to
determine
and
yet
that
this
is
the
case
with
some
very
few
exceptions
is
most
manifest
of
these
i
shall
willingly
admit
burnet
and
addison
if
the
former
was
not
perhaps
to
be
considered
as
a
political
essayist
and
the
latter
as
a
commentator
on
the
classics
rather
than
as
a
writer
of
travels
which
last
title
perhaps
they
would
both
of
them
have
been
least
ambitious
to
affect
indeed
if
these
two
and
two
or
three
more
should
be
removed
from
the
mass
there
would
remain
such
a
heap
of
dullness
behind
that
the
appellation
of
would
not
appear
very
desirable
i
am
not
here
unapprised
that
old
homer
himself
is
by
some
considered
as
a
and
indeed
the
beginning
of
his
odyssey
may
be
urged
to
countenance
that
opinion
which
i
shall
not
controvert
but
whatever
species
of
writing
the
odyssey
is
of
it
is
surely
at
the
head
of
that
species
as
much
as
the
iliad
is
of
another
and
so
far
the
excellent
longinus
would
allow
i
believe
at
this
day
but
in
reality
the
odyssey
the
telemachus
and
all
of
that
kind
are
to
the
i
here
intend
what
romance
is
to
true
history
the
former
being
the
confounder
and
corrupter
of
the
latter
i
am
far
from
supposing
that
homer
hesiod
and
the
other
ancient
poets
and
mythologists
had
any
settled
design
to
pervert
and
confuse
the
records
of
antiquity
but
it
is
certain
they
have
effected
it
and
for
my
part
i
must
confess
i
should
have
honored
and
loved
homer
more
had
he
written
a
true
history
of
his
own
times
in
humble
prose
than
those
noble
poems
that
have
so
justly
collected
the
praise
of
all
ages
for
though
i
read
these
with
more
admiration
and
astonishment
i
still
read
herodotus
thucydides
and
xenophon
with
more
amusement
and
more
satisfaction
the
original
poets
were
not
however
without
excuse
they
found
the
limits
of
nature
too
straight
for
the
immensity
of
their
genius
which
they
had
not
room
to
exert
without
extending
fact
by
fiction
and
that
especially
at
a
time
when
the
manners
of
men
were
too
simple
to
afford
that
variety
which
they
have
since
offered
in
vain
to
the
choice
of
the
meanest
writers
in
doing
this
they
are
again
excusable
for
the
manner
in
which
they
have
done
it
ut
speciosa
dehine
miracula
promant
they
are
not
indeed
so
properly
said
to
turn
reality
into
fiction
as
fiction
into
reality
their
paintings
are
so
bold
their
colors
so
strong
that
everything
they
touch
seems
to
exist
in
the
very
manner
they
represent
it
their
portraits
are
so
just
and
their
landscapes
so
beautiful
that
we
acknowledge
the
strokes
of
nature
in
both
without
inquiring
whether
nature
herself
or
her
journeyman
the
poet
formed
the
first
pattern
of
the
piece
but
other
writers
i
will
put
pliny
at
their
head
have
no
such
pretensions
to
indulgence
they
lie
for
lying
sake
or
in
order
insolently
to
impose
the
most
monstrous
improbabilities
and
absurdities
upon
their
readers
on
their
own
authority
treating
them
as
some
fathers
treat
children
and
as
other
fathers
do
laymen
exacting
their
belief
of
whatever
they
relate
on
no
other
foundation
than
their
own
authority
without
ever
taking
the
pains
or
adapting
their
lies
to
human
credulity
and
of
calculating
them
for
the
meridian
of
a
common
understanding
but
with
as
much
weakness
as
wickedness
and
with
more
impudence
often
than
either
they
assert
facts
contrary
to
the
honor
of
god
to
the
visible
order
of
the
creation
to
the
known
laws
of
nature
to
the
histories
of
former
ages
and
to
the
experience
of
our
own
and
which
no
man
can
at
once
understand
and
believe
if
it
should
be
objected
and
it
can
nowhere
be
objected
better
than
where
i
now
write
as
there
is
nowhere
more
pomp
of
bigotry
that
whole
nations
have
been
firm
believers
in
such
most
absurd
suppositions
i
reply
the
fact
is
not
true
they
have
known
nothing
of
the
matter
and
have
believed
they
knew
not
what
it
is
indeed
with
me
no
matter
of
doubt
but
that
the
pope
and
his
clergy
might
teach
any
of
those
christian
heterodoxies
the
tenets
of
which
are
the
most
diametrically
opposite
to
their
own
nay
all
the
doctrines
of
zoroaster
confucius
and
mahomet
not
only
with
certain
and
immediate
success
but
without
one
catholic
in
a
thousand
knowing
he
had
changed
his
religion
footnote
at
lisbon
what
motive
a
man
can
have
to
sit
down
and
to
draw
forth
a
list
of
stupid
senseless
incredible
lies
upon
paper
would
be
difficult
to
determine
did
not
vanity
present
herself
so
immediately
as
the
adequate
cause
the
vanity
of
knowing
more
than
other
men
is
perhaps
besides
hunger
the
only
inducement
to
writing
at
least
to
publishing
at
all
why
then
should
not
the
be
inflamed
with
the
glory
of
having
seen
what
no
man
ever
did
or
will
see
but
himself
this
is
the
true
source
of
the
wonderful
in
the
discourse
and
writings
and
sometimes
i
believe
in
the
actions
of
men
there
is
another
fault
of
a
kind
directly
opposite
to
this
to
which
these
writers
are
sometimes
liable
when
instead
of
filling
their
pages
with
monsters
which
nobody
hath
ever
seen
and
with
adventures
which
never
have
nor
could
possibly
have
happened
to
them
waste
their
time
and
paper
with
recording
things
and
facts
of
so
common
a
kind
that
they
challenge
no
other
right
of
being
remembered
than
as
they
had
the
honor
of
having
happened
to
the
author
to
whom
nothing
seems
trivial
that
in
any
manner
happens
to
himself
of
such
consequence
do
his
own
actions
appear
to
one
of
this
kind
that
he
would
probably
think
himself
guilty
of
infidelity
should
he
omit
the
minutest
thing
in
the
detail
of
his
journal
that
the
fact
is
true
is
sufficient
to
give
it
a
place
there
without
any
consideration
whether
it
is
capable
of
pleasing
or
surprising
of
diverting
or
informing
the
reader
i
have
seen
a
play
if
i
mistake
not
it
is
one
of
or
of
centlivre
where
this
vice
in
a
is
finely
ridiculed
an
ignorant
pedant
to
whose
government
for
i
know
not
what
reason
the
conduct
of
a
young
nobleman
in
his
travels
is
committed
and
who
is
sent
abroad
to
show
my
lord
the
world
of
which
he
knows
nothing
himself
before
his
departure
from
a
town
calls
for
his
journal
to
record
the
goodness
of
the
wine
and
tobacco
with
other
articles
of
the
same
importance
which
are
to
furnish
the
materials
of
a
voyage
at
his
return
home
the
humor
it
is
true
is
here
carried
very
far
and
yet
perhaps
very
little
beyond
what
is
to
be
found
in
writers
who
profess
no
intention
of
dealing
in
humor
at
all
of
one
or
other
or
both
of
these
kinds
are
i
conceive
all
that
vast
pile
of
books
which
pass
under
the
names
of
voyages
travels
adventures
lives
memoirs
histories
some
of
which
a
single
traveler
sends
into
the
world
in
many
volumes
and
others
are
by
judicious
booksellers
collected
into
vast
bodies
in
folio
and
inscribed
with
their
own
names
as
if
they
were
indeed
their
own
travels
thus
unjustly
attributing
to
themselves
the
merit
of
others
now
from
both
these
faults
we
have
endeavored
to
steer
clear
in
the
following
narrative
which
however
the
contrary
may
be
insinuated
by
ignorant
unlearned
and
critics
who
have
never
traveled
either
in
books
or
ships
i
do
solemnly
declare
doth
in
my
own
impartial
opinion
deviate
less
from
truth
than
any
other
voyage
extant
my
lord
anson
alone
being
perhaps
excepted
some
few
embellishments
must
be
allowed
to
every
historian
for
we
are
not
to
conceive
that
the
speeches
in
livy
sallust
or
thucydides
were
literally
spoken
in
the
very
words
in
which
we
now
read
them
it
is
sufficient
that
every
fact
hath
its
foundation
in
truth
as
i
do
seriously
aver
is
the
ease
in
the
ensuing
pages
and
when
it
is
so
a
good
critic
will
be
so
far
from
denying
all
kind
of
ornament
of
style
or
diction
or
even
of
circumstance
to
his
author
that
he
would
be
rather
sorry
if
he
omitted
it
for
he
could
hence
derive
no
other
advantage
than
the
loss
of
an
additional
pleasure
in
the
perusal
again
if
any
merely
common
incident
should
appear
in
this
journal
which
will
seldom
i
apprehend
be
the
case
the
candid
reader
will
easily
perceive
it
is
not
introduced
for
its
own
sake
but
for
some
observations
and
reflections
naturally
resulting
from
it
and
which
if
but
little
to
his
amusement
tend
directly
to
the
instruction
of
the
reader
or
to
the
information
of
the
public
to
whom
if
i
choose
to
convey
such
instruction
or
information
with
an
air
of
joke
and
laughter
none
but
the
dullest
of
fellows
will
i
believe
censure
it
but
if
they
should
i
have
the
authority
of
more
than
one
passage
in
horace
to
allege
in
my
defense
having
thus
endeavored
to
obviate
some
censures
to
which
a
man
without
the
gift
of
foresight
or
any
fear
of
the
imputation
of
being
a
conjurer
might
conceive
this
work
would
be
liable
i
might
now
undertake
a
more
pleasing
task
and
fall
at
once
to
the
direct
and
positive
praises
of
the
work
itself
of
which
indeed
i
could
say
a
thousand
good
things
but
the
task
is
so
very
pleasant
that
i
shall
leave
it
wholly
to
the
reader
and
it
is
all
the
task
that
i
impose
on
him
a
moderation
for
which
he
may
think
himself
obliged
to
me
when
he
compares
it
with
the
conduct
of
authors
who
often
fill
a
whole
sheet
with
their
own
praises
to
which
they
sometimes
set
their
own
real
names
and
sometimes
a
fictitious
one
one
hint
however
i
must
give
the
kind
reader
which
is
that
if
he
should
be
able
to
find
no
sort
of
amusement
in
the
book
he
will
be
pleased
to
remember
the
public
utility
which
will
arise
from
it
if
entertainment
as
richardson
observes
be
but
a
secondary
consideration
in
a
romance
with
which
addison
i
think
agrees
affirming
the
use
of
the
pastry
cook
to
be
the
first
if
this
i
say
be
true
of
a
mere
work
of
invention
sure
it
may
well
be
so
considered
in
a
work
founded
like
this
on
truth
and
where
the
political
reflections
form
so
distinguishing
a
part
but
perhaps
i
may
hear
from
some
critic
of
the
most
saturnine
complexion
that
my
vanity
must
have
made
a
horrid
dupe
of
my
judgment
if
it
hath
flattered
me
with
an
expectation
of
having
anything
here
seen
in
a
grave
light
or
of
conveying
any
useful
instruction
to
the
public
or
to
their
guardians
i
answer
with
the
great
man
whom
i
just
now
quoted
that
my
purpose
is
to
convey
instruction
in
the
vehicle
of
entertainment
and
so
to
bring
about
at
once
like
the
revolution
in
the
rehearsal
a
perfect
reformation
of
the
laws
relating
to
our
maritime
affairs
an
undertaking
i
will
not
say
more
modest
but
surely
more
feasible
than
that
of
reforming
a
whole
people
by
making
use
of
a
vehicular
story
to
wheel
in
among
them
worse
manners
than
their
own
introduction
in
the
beginning
of
august
when
i
had
taken
the
duke
of
portland
medicine
as
it
is
called
near
a
year
the
effects
of
which
had
been
the
carrying
off
the
symptoms
of
a
lingering
imperfect
gout
i
was
persuaded
by
ranby
the
king
premier
and
the
ablest
advice
i
believe
in
all
branches
of
the
physical
profession
to
go
immediately
to
bath
i
accordingly
wrote
that
very
night
to
bowden
who
by
the
next
post
informed
me
she
had
taken
me
a
lodging
for
a
month
certain
within
a
few
days
after
this
whilst
i
was
preparing
for
my
journey
and
when
i
was
almost
fatigued
to
death
with
several
long
examinations
relating
to
five
different
murders
all
committed
within
the
space
of
a
week
by
different
gangs
of
i
received
a
message
from
his
grace
the
duke
of
newcastle
by
carrington
the
king
messenger
to
attend
his
grace
the
next
morning
in
upon
some
business
of
importance
but
i
excused
myself
from
complying
with
the
message
as
besides
being
lame
i
was
very
ill
with
the
great
fatigues
i
had
lately
undergone
added
to
my
distemper
his
grace
however
sent
carrington
the
very
next
morning
with
another
summons
with
which
though
in
the
utmost
distress
i
immediately
complied
but
the
duke
happening
unfortunately
for
me
to
be
then
particularly
engaged
after
i
had
waited
some
time
sent
a
gentleman
to
discourse
with
me
on
the
best
plan
which
could
be
invented
for
putting
an
immediate
end
to
those
murders
and
robberies
which
were
every
day
committed
in
the
streets
upon
which
i
promised
to
transmit
my
opinion
in
writing
to
his
grace
who
as
the
gentleman
informed
me
intended
to
lay
it
before
the
privy
council
though
this
visit
cost
me
a
severe
cold
i
notwithstanding
set
myself
down
to
work
and
in
about
four
days
sent
the
duke
as
regular
a
plan
as
i
could
form
with
all
the
reasons
and
arguments
i
could
bring
to
support
it
drawn
out
in
several
sheets
of
paper
and
soon
received
a
message
from
the
duke
by
carrington
acquainting
me
that
my
plan
was
highly
approved
of
and
that
all
the
terms
of
it
would
be
complied
with
the
principal
and
most
material
of
those
terms
was
the
immediately
depositing
six
hundred
pound
in
my
hands
at
which
small
charge
i
undertook
to
demolish
the
then
reigning
gangs
and
to
put
the
civil
policy
into
such
order
that
no
such
gangs
should
ever
be
able
for
the
future
to
form
themselves
into
bodies
or
at
least
to
remain
any
time
formidable
to
the
public
i
had
delayed
my
bath
journey
for
some
time
contrary
to
the
repeated
advice
of
my
physical
acquaintance
and
to
the
ardent
desire
of
my
warmest
friends
though
my
distemper
was
now
turned
to
a
deep
jaundice
in
which
case
the
bath
waters
are
generally
reputed
to
be
almost
infallible
but
i
had
the
most
eager
desire
of
demolishing
this
gang
of
villains
and
which
i
was
sure
of
accomplishing
the
moment
i
was
enabled
to
pay
a
fellow
who
had
undertaken
for
a
small
sum
to
betray
them
into
the
hands
of
a
set
of
whom
i
had
enlisted
into
the
service
all
men
of
known
and
approved
fidelity
and
intrepidity
after
some
weeks
the
money
was
paid
at
the
treasury
and
within
a
few
days
after
two
hundred
pounds
of
it
had
come
to
my
hands
the
whole
gang
of
was
entirely
dispersed
seven
of
them
were
in
actual
custody
and
the
rest
driven
some
out
of
the
town
and
others
out
of
the
kingdom
though
my
health
was
now
reduced
to
the
last
extremity
i
continued
to
act
with
the
utmost
vigor
against
these
villains
in
examining
whom
and
in
taking
the
depositions
against
them
i
have
often
spent
whole
days
nay
sometimes
whole
nights
especially
when
there
was
any
difficulty
in
procuring
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
them
which
is
a
very
common
case
in
even
when
the
guilt
of
the
party
is
sufficiently
apparent
to
satisfy
the
most
tender
conscience
but
courts
of
justice
know
nothing
of
a
cause
more
than
what
is
told
them
on
oath
by
a
witness
and
the
most
flagitious
villain
upon
earth
is
tried
in
the
same
manner
as
a
man
of
the
best
character
who
is
accused
of
the
same
crime
meanwhile
amidst
all
my
fatigues
and
distresses
i
had
the
satisfaction
to
find
my
endeavors
had
been
attended
with
such
success
that
this
hellish
society
were
almost
utterly
extirpated
and
that
instead
of
reading
of
murders
and
in
the
news
almost
every
morning
there
was
in
the
remaining
part
of
the
month
of
november
and
in
all
december
not
only
no
such
thing
as
a
murder
but
not
even
a
committed
some
such
indeed
were
mentioned
in
the
public
papers
but
they
were
all
found
on
the
strictest
inquiry
to
be
false
in
this
entire
freedom
from
during
the
dark
months
no
man
will
i
believe
scruple
to
acknowledge
that
the
winter
of
stands
unrivaled
during
a
course
of
many
years
and
this
may
possibly
appear
the
more
extraordinary
to
those
who
recollect
the
outrages
with
which
it
began
having
thus
fully
accomplished
my
undertaking
i
went
into
the
country
in
a
very
weak
and
deplorable
condition
with
no
fewer
or
less
diseases
than
a
jaundice
a
dropsy
and
an
asthma
altogether
uniting
their
forces
in
the
destruction
of
a
body
so
entirely
emaciated
that
it
had
lost
all
its
muscular
flesh
mine
was
now
no
longer
what
was
called
a
bath
case
nor
if
it
had
been
so
had
i
strength
remaining
sufficient
to
go
thither
a
ride
of
six
miles
only
being
attended
with
an
intolerable
fatigue
i
now
discharged
my
lodgings
at
bath
which
i
had
hitherto
kept
i
began
in
earnest
to
look
on
my
case
as
desperate
and
i
had
vanity
enough
to
rank
myself
with
those
heroes
who
of
old
times
became
voluntary
sacrifices
to
the
good
of
the
public
but
lest
the
reader
should
be
too
eager
to
catch
at
the
word
vanity
and
should
be
unwilling
to
indulge
me
with
so
sublime
a
gratification
for
i
think
he
is
not
too
apt
to
gratify
me
i
will
take
my
key
a
pitch
lower
and
will
frankly
own
that
i
had
a
stronger
motive
than
the
love
of
the
public
to
push
me
on
i
will
therefore
confess
to
him
that
my
private
affairs
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
had
but
a
gloomy
aspect
for
i
had
not
plundered
the
public
or
the
poor
of
those
sums
which
men
who
are
always
ready
to
plunder
both
as
much
as
they
can
have
been
pleased
to
suspect
me
of
taking
on
the
contrary
by
composing
instead
of
inflaming
the
quarrels
of
porters
and
beggars
which
i
blush
when
i
say
hath
not
been
universally
practiced
and
by
refusing
to
take
a
shilling
from
a
man
who
most
undoubtedly
would
not
have
had
another
left
i
had
reduced
an
income
of
about
five
hundred
pounds
of
the
dirtiest
money
upon
earth
to
little
more
than
three
hundred
pounds
a
considerable
proportion
of
which
remained
with
my
clerk
and
indeed
if
the
whole
had
done
so
as
it
ought
he
would
be
but
ill
paid
for
sitting
almost
sixteen
hours
in
the
in
the
most
unwholesome
as
well
as
nauseous
air
in
the
universe
and
which
hath
in
his
case
corrupted
a
good
constitution
without
contaminating
his
morals
footnote
a
predecessor
of
mine
used
to
boast
that
he
made
one
thousand
pounds
in
his
office
but
how
he
did
this
if
indeed
he
did
it
is
to
me
a
secret
his
clerk
now
mine
told
me
i
had
more
business
than
he
had
ever
known
there
i
am
sure
i
had
as
much
as
any
man
could
do
the
truth
is
the
fees
are
so
very
low
when
any
are
due
and
so
much
is
done
for
nothing
that
if
a
single
justice
of
peace
had
business
enough
to
employ
twenty
clerks
neither
he
nor
they
would
get
much
by
their
labor
the
public
will
not
therefore
i
hope
think
i
betray
a
secret
when
i
inform
them
that
i
received
from
the
government
a
yearly
pension
out
of
the
public
service
money
which
i
believe
indeed
would
have
been
larger
had
my
great
patron
been
convinced
of
an
error
which
i
have
heard
him
utter
more
than
once
that
he
could
not
indeed
say
that
the
acting
as
a
principal
justice
of
peace
in
westminster
was
on
all
accounts
very
desirable
but
that
all
the
world
knew
it
was
a
very
lucrative
office
now
to
have
shown
him
plainly
that
a
man
must
be
a
rogue
to
make
a
very
little
this
way
and
that
he
could
not
make
much
by
being
as
great
a
rogue
as
he
could
be
would
have
required
more
confidence
than
i
believe
he
had
in
me
and
more
of
his
conversation
than
he
chose
to
allow
me
i
therefore
resigned
the
office
and
the
farther
execution
of
my
plan
to
my
brother
who
had
long
been
my
assistant
and
now
lest
the
case
between
me
and
the
reader
should
be
the
same
in
both
instances
as
it
was
between
me
and
the
great
man
i
will
not
add
another
word
on
the
subject
but
not
to
trouble
the
reader
with
anecdotes
contrary
to
my
own
rule
laid
down
in
my
preface
i
assure
him
i
thought
my
family
was
very
slenderly
provided
for
and
that
my
health
began
to
decline
so
fast
that
i
had
very
little
more
of
life
left
to
accomplish
what
i
had
thought
of
too
late
i
rejoiced
therefore
greatly
in
seeing
an
opportunity
as
i
apprehended
of
gaining
such
merit
in
the
eye
of
the
public
that
if
my
life
were
the
sacrifice
to
it
my
friends
might
think
they
did
a
popular
act
in
putting
my
family
at
least
beyond
the
reach
of
necessity
which
i
myself
began
to
despair
of
doing
and
though
i
disclaim
all
pretense
to
that
spartan
or
roman
patriotism
which
loved
the
public
so
well
that
it
was
always
ready
to
become
a
voluntary
sacrifice
to
the
public
good
i
do
solemnly
declare
i
have
that
love
for
my
family
after
this
confession
therefore
that
the
public
was
not
the
principal
deity
to
which
my
life
was
offered
a
sacrifice
and
when
it
is
farther
considered
what
a
poor
sacrifice
this
was
being
indeed
no
other
than
the
giving
up
what
i
saw
little
likelihood
of
being
able
to
hold
much
longer
and
which
upon
the
terms
i
held
it
nothing
but
the
weakness
of
human
nature
could
represent
to
me
as
worth
holding
at
all
the
world
may
i
believe
without
envy
allow
me
all
the
praise
to
which
i
have
any
title
my
aim
in
fact
was
not
praise
which
is
the
last
gift
they
care
to
bestow
at
least
this
was
not
my
aim
as
an
end
but
rather
as
a
means
of
purchasing
some
moderate
provision
for
my
family
which
though
it
should
exceed
my
merit
must
fall
infinitely
short
of
my
service
if
i
succeeded
in
my
attempt
to
say
the
truth
the
public
never
act
more
wisely
than
when
they
act
most
liberally
in
the
distribution
of
their
rewards
and
here
the
good
they
receive
is
often
more
to
be
considered
than
the
motive
from
which
they
receive
it
example
alone
is
the
end
of
all
public
punishments
and
rewards
laws
never
inflict
disgrace
in
resentment
nor
confer
honor
from
gratitude
for
it
is
very
hard
my
lord
said
a
convicted
felon
at
the
bar
to
the
late
excellent
judge
burnet
to
hang
a
poor
man
for
stealing
a
horse
you
are
not
to
be
hanged
sir
answered
my
and
beloved
friend
for
stealing
a
horse
but
you
are
to
be
hanged
that
horses
may
not
be
stolen
in
like
manner
it
might
have
been
said
to
the
late
duke
of
marlborough
when
the
parliament
was
so
deservedly
liberal
to
him
after
the
battle
of
blenheim
you
receive
not
these
honors
and
bounties
on
account
of
a
victory
past
but
that
other
victories
may
be
obtained
i
was
now
in
the
opinion
of
all
men
dying
of
a
complication
of
disorders
and
were
i
desirous
of
playing
the
advocate
i
have
an
occasion
fair
enough
but
i
disdain
such
an
attempt
i
relate
facts
plainly
and
simply
as
they
are
and
let
the
world
draw
from
them
what
conclusions
they
please
taking
with
them
the
following
facts
for
their
instruction
the
one
is
that
the
proclamation
offering
one
hundred
pounds
for
the
apprehending
felons
for
certain
felonies
committed
in
certain
places
which
i
prevented
from
being
revived
had
formerly
cost
the
government
several
thousand
pounds
within
a
single
year
secondly
that
all
such
proclamations
instead
of
curing
the
evil
had
actually
increased
it
had
multiplied
the
number
of
robberies
had
propagated
the
worst
and
wickedest
of
perjuries
had
laid
snares
for
youth
and
ignorance
which
by
the
temptation
of
these
rewards
had
been
sometimes
drawn
into
guilt
and
sometimes
which
can
not
be
thought
on
without
the
highest
horror
had
destroyed
them
without
it
thirdly
that
my
plan
had
not
put
the
government
to
more
than
three
hundred
pound
expense
and
had
produced
none
of
the
ill
consequences
above
mentioned
but
lastly
had
actually
suppressed
the
evil
for
a
time
and
had
plainly
pointed
out
the
means
of
suppressing
it
for
ever
this
i
would
myself
have
undertaken
had
my
health
permitted
at
the
annual
expense
of
the
sum
after
having
stood
the
terrible
six
weeks
which
succeeded
last
christmas
and
put
a
lucky
end
if
they
had
known
their
own
interests
to
such
numbers
of
aged
and
infirm
valetudinarians
who
might
have
gasped
through
two
or
three
mild
winters
more
i
returned
to
town
in
february
in
a
condition
less
despaired
of
by
myself
than
by
any
of
my
friends
i
now
became
the
patient
of
ward
who
wished
i
had
taken
his
advice
earlier
by
his
advice
i
was
tapped
and
fourteen
quarts
of
water
drawn
from
my
belly
the
sudden
relaxation
which
this
caused
added
to
my
enervate
emaciated
habit
of
body
so
weakened
me
that
within
two
days
i
was
thought
to
be
falling
into
the
agonies
of
death
i
was
at
the
worst
on
that
memorable
day
when
the
public
lost
pelham
from
that
day
i
began
slowly
as
it
were
to
draw
my
feet
out
of
the
grave
till
in
two
months
time
i
had
again
acquired
some
little
degree
of
strength
but
was
again
full
of
water
during
this
whole
time
i
took
ward
medicines
which
had
seldom
any
perceptible
operation
those
in
particular
of
the
diaphoretic
kind
the
working
of
which
is
thought
to
require
a
great
strength
of
constitution
to
support
had
so
little
effect
on
me
that
ward
declared
it
was
as
vain
to
attempt
sweating
me
as
a
deal
board
in
this
situation
i
was
tapped
a
second
time
i
had
one
quart
of
water
less
taken
from
me
now
than
before
but
i
bore
all
the
consequences
of
the
operation
much
better
this
i
attributed
greatly
to
a
dose
of
laudanum
prescribed
by
my
surgeon
it
first
gave
me
the
most
delicious
flow
of
spirits
and
afterwards
as
comfortable
a
nap
the
month
of
may
which
was
now
begun
it
seemed
reasonable
to
expect
would
introduce
the
spring
and
drive
of
that
winter
which
yet
maintained
its
footing
on
the
stage
i
resolved
therefore
to
visit
a
little
house
of
mine
in
the
country
which
stands
at
ealing
in
the
county
of
middlesex
in
the
best
air
i
believe
in
the
whole
kingdom
and
far
superior
to
that
of
kensington
for
the
gravel
is
here
much
wider
and
deeper
the
place
higher
and
more
open
towards
the
south
whilst
it
is
guarded
from
the
north
wind
by
a
ridge
of
hills
and
from
the
smells
and
smoke
of
london
by
its
distance
which
last
is
not
the
fate
of
kensington
when
the
wind
blows
from
any
corner
of
the
east
obligations
to
ward
i
shall
always
confess
for
i
am
convinced
that
he
omitted
no
care
in
endeavoring
to
serve
me
without
any
expectation
or
desire
of
fee
or
reward
the
powers
of
ward
remedies
want
indeed
no
unfair
puffs
of
mine
to
give
them
credit
and
though
this
distemper
of
the
dropsy
stands
i
believe
first
in
the
list
of
those
over
which
he
is
always
certain
of
triumphing
yet
possibly
there
might
be
something
particular
in
my
case
capable
of
eluding
that
radical
force
which
had
healed
so
many
thousands
the
same
distemper
in
different
constitutions
may
possibly
be
attended
with
such
different
symptoms
that
to
find
an
infallible
nostrum
for
the
curing
any
one
distemper
in
every
patient
may
be
almost
as
difficult
as
to
find
a
panacea
for
the
cure
of
all
but
even
such
a
panacea
one
of
the
greatest
scholars
and
best
of
men
did
lately
apprehend
he
had
discovered
it
is
true
indeed
he
was
no
physician
that
is
he
had
not
by
the
forms
of
his
education
acquired
a
right
of
applying
his
skill
in
the
art
of
physic
to
his
own
private
advantage
and
yet
perhaps
it
may
be
truly
asserted
that
no
other
modern
hath
contributed
so
much
to
make
his
physical
skill
useful
to
the
public
at
least
that
none
hath
undergone
the
pains
of
communicating
this
discovery
in
writing
to
the
world
the
reader
i
think
will
scarce
need
to
be
informed
that
the
writer
i
mean
is
the
late
bishop
of
cloyne
in
ireland
and
the
discovery
that
of
the
virtues
of
i
then
happened
to
recollect
upon
a
hint
given
me
by
the
inimitable
and
author
of
the
female
quixote
that
i
had
many
years
before
from
curiosity
only
taken
a
cursory
view
of
bishop
berkeley
treatise
on
the
virtues
of
which
i
had
formerly
observed
he
strongly
contends
to
be
that
real
panacea
which
sydenham
supposes
to
have
an
existence
in
nature
though
it
yet
remains
undiscovered
and
perhaps
will
always
remain
so
upon
the
reperusal
of
this
book
i
found
the
bishop
only
asserting
his
opinion
that
might
be
useful
in
the
dropsy
since
he
had
known
it
to
have
a
surprising
success
in
the
cure
of
a
most
stubborn
anasarca
which
is
indeed
no
other
than
as
the
word
implies
the
dropsy
of
the
flesh
and
this
was
at
that
time
a
large
part
of
my
complaint
after
a
short
trial
therefore
of
a
milk
diet
which
i
presently
found
did
not
suit
with
my
case
i
betook
myself
to
the
bishop
prescription
and
dosed
myself
every
morning
and
evening
with
half
a
pint
of
it
was
no
more
than
three
weeks
since
my
last
tapping
and
my
belly
and
limbs
were
distended
with
water
this
did
not
give
me
the
worse
opinion
of
for
i
never
supposed
there
could
be
any
such
virtue
in
as
immediately
to
carry
off
a
quantity
of
water
already
collected
for
my
delivery
from
this
i
well
knew
i
must
be
again
obliged
to
the
trochar
and
that
if
the
did
me
any
good
at
all
it
must
be
only
by
the
slowest
degrees
and
that
if
it
should
ever
get
the
better
of
my
distemper
it
must
be
by
the
tedious
operation
of
undermining
and
not
by
a
sudden
attack
and
storm
some
visible
effects
however
and
far
beyond
what
my
most
sanguine
hopes
could
with
any
modesty
expect
i
very
soon
experienced
the
having
from
the
very
first
lessened
my
illness
increased
my
appetite
and
added
though
in
a
very
slow
proportion
to
my
bodily
strength
but
if
my
strength
had
increased
a
little
my
water
daily
increased
much
more
so
that
by
the
end
of
may
my
belly
became
again
ripe
for
the
trochar
and
i
was
a
third
time
tapped
upon
which
two
very
favorable
symptoms
appeared
i
had
three
quarts
of
water
taken
from
me
less
than
had
been
taken
the
last
time
and
i
bore
the
relaxation
with
much
less
indeed
with
scarce
any
faintness
those
of
my
physical
friends
on
whose
judgment
i
chiefly
depended
seemed
to
think
my
only
chance
of
life
consisted
in
having
the
whole
summer
before
me
in
which
i
might
hope
to
gather
sufficient
strength
to
encounter
the
inclemencies
of
the
ensuing
winter
but
this
chance
began
daily
to
lessen
i
saw
the
summer
mouldering
away
or
rather
indeed
the
year
passing
away
without
intending
to
bring
on
any
summer
at
all
in
the
whole
month
of
may
the
sun
scarce
appeared
three
times
so
that
the
early
fruits
came
to
the
fullness
of
their
growth
and
to
some
appearance
of
ripeness
without
acquiring
any
real
maturity
having
wanted
the
heat
of
the
sun
to
soften
and
meliorate
their
juices
i
saw
the
dropsy
gaining
rather
than
losing
ground
the
distance
growing
still
shorter
between
the
tappings
i
saw
the
asthma
likewise
beginning
again
to
become
more
troublesome
i
saw
the
midsummer
quarter
drawing
towards
a
close
so
that
i
conceived
if
the
michaelmas
quarter
should
steal
off
in
the
same
manner
as
it
was
in
my
opinion
very
much
to
be
apprehended
it
would
i
should
be
delivered
up
to
the
attacks
of
winter
before
i
recruited
my
forces
so
as
to
be
anywise
able
to
withstand
them
i
now
began
to
recall
an
intention
which
from
the
first
dawnings
of
my
recovery
i
had
conceived
of
removing
to
a
warmer
climate
and
finding
this
to
be
approved
of
by
a
very
eminent
physician
i
resolved
to
put
it
into
immediate
execution
aix
in
provence
was
the
place
first
thought
on
but
the
difficulties
of
getting
thither
were
insuperable
the
journey
by
land
beside
the
expense
of
it
was
infinitely
too
long
and
fatiguing
and
i
could
hear
of
no
ship
that
was
likely
to
set
out
from
london
within
any
reasonable
time
for
marseilles
or
any
other
port
in
that
part
of
the
mediterranean
lisbon
was
presently
fixed
on
in
its
room
the
air
here
as
it
was
near
four
degrees
to
the
south
of
aix
must
be
more
mild
and
warm
and
the
winter
shorter
and
less
piercing
it
was
not
difficult
to
find
a
ship
bound
to
a
place
with
which
we
carry
on
so
immense
a
trade
accordingly
my
brother
soon
informed
me
of
the
excellent
accommodations
for
passengers
which
were
to
be
found
on
board
a
ship
that
was
obliged
to
sail
for
lisbon
in
three
days
i
eagerly
embraced
the
offer
notwithstanding
the
shortness
of
the
time
and
having
given
my
brother
full
power
to
contract
for
our
passage
i
began
to
prepare
my
family
for
the
voyage
with
the
utmost
expedition
but
our
great
haste
was
needless
for
the
captain
having
twice
put
off
his
sailing
i
at
length
invited
him
to
dinner
with
me
at
fordhook
a
full
week
after
the
time
on
which
he
had
declared
and
that
with
many
asseverations
he
must
and
would
weigh
anchor
he
dined
with
me
according
to
his
appointment
and
when
all
matters
were
settled
between
us
left
me
with
positive
orders
to
be
on
board
the
wednesday
following
when
he
declared
he
would
fall
down
the
river
to
gravesend
and
would
not
stay
a
moment
for
the
greatest
man
in
the
world
he
advised
me
to
go
to
gravesend
by
land
and
there
wait
the
arrival
of
his
ship
assigning
many
reasons
for
this
every
one
of
which
was
as
i
well
remember
among
those
that
had
before
determined
me
to
go
on
board
near
the
tower
the
voyage
wednesday
june
on
this
day
the
most
melancholy
sun
i
had
ever
beheld
arose
and
found
me
awake
at
my
house
at
fordhook
by
the
light
of
this
sun
i
was
in
my
own
opinion
last
to
behold
and
take
leave
of
some
of
those
creatures
on
whom
i
doted
with
a
fondness
guided
by
nature
and
passion
and
uncured
and
unhardened
by
all
the
doctrine
of
that
philosophical
school
where
i
had
learned
to
bear
pains
and
to
despise
death
in
this
situation
as
i
could
not
conquer
nature
i
submitted
entirely
to
her
and
she
made
as
great
a
fool
of
me
as
she
had
ever
done
of
any
woman
whatsoever
under
pretense
of
giving
me
leave
to
enjoy
she
drew
me
in
to
suffer
the
company
of
my
little
ones
during
eight
hours
and
i
doubt
not
whether
in
that
time
i
did
not
undergo
more
than
in
all
my
distemper
at
twelve
precisely
my
coach
was
at
the
door
which
was
no
sooner
told
me
than
i
kissed
my
children
round
and
went
into
it
with
some
little
resolution
my
wife
who
behaved
more
like
a
heroine
and
philosopher
though
at
the
same
time
the
tenderest
mother
in
the
world
and
my
eldest
daughter
followed
me
some
friends
went
with
us
and
others
here
took
their
leave
and
i
heard
my
behavior
applauded
with
many
murmurs
and
praises
to
which
i
well
knew
i
had
no
title
as
all
other
such
philosophers
may
if
they
have
any
modesty
confess
on
the
like
occasions
in
two
hours
we
arrived
in
rotherhithe
and
immediately
went
on
board
and
were
to
have
sailed
the
next
morning
but
as
this
was
the
and
consequently
a
holiday
at
the
the
captain
could
not
clear
his
vessel
till
the
thursday
for
these
holidays
are
as
strictly
observed
as
those
in
the
popish
calendar
and
are
almost
as
numerous
i
might
add
that
both
are
opposite
to
the
genius
of
trade
and
consequently
contra
bonum
publicum
to
go
on
board
the
ship
it
was
necessary
first
to
go
into
a
boat
a
matter
of
no
small
difficulty
as
i
had
no
use
of
my
limbs
and
was
to
be
carried
by
men
who
though
sufficiently
strong
for
their
burden
were
like
archimedes
puzzled
to
find
a
steady
footing
of
this
as
few
of
my
readers
have
not
gone
into
wherries
on
the
thames
they
will
easily
be
able
to
form
to
themselves
an
idea
however
by
the
assistance
of
my
friend
welch
whom
i
never
think
or
speak
of
but
with
love
and
esteem
i
conquered
this
difficulty
as
i
did
afterwards
that
of
ascending
the
ship
into
which
i
was
hoisted
with
more
ease
by
a
chair
lifted
with
pulleys
i
was
soon
seated
in
a
great
chair
in
the
cabin
to
refresh
myself
after
a
fatigue
which
had
been
more
intolerable
in
a
quarter
of
a
mile
passage
from
my
coach
to
the
ship
than
i
had
before
undergone
in
a
of
twelve
miles
which
i
had
traveled
with
the
utmost
expedition
this
latter
fatigue
was
perhaps
somewhat
heightened
by
an
indignation
which
i
could
not
prevent
arising
in
my
mind
i
think
upon
my
entrance
into
the
boat
i
presented
a
spectacle
of
the
highest
horror
the
total
loss
of
limbs
was
apparent
to
all
who
saw
me
and
my
face
contained
marks
of
a
most
diseased
state
if
not
of
death
itself
indeed
so
ghastly
was
my
countenance
that
timorous
women
with
child
had
abstained
from
my
house
for
fear
of
the
ill
consequences
of
looking
at
me
in
this
condition
i
ran
the
gauntlope
so
i
think
i
may
justly
call
it
through
rows
of
sailors
and
watermen
few
of
whom
failed
of
paying
their
compliments
to
me
by
all
manner
of
insults
and
jests
on
my
misery
no
man
who
knew
me
will
think
i
conceived
any
personal
resentment
at
this
behavior
but
it
was
a
lively
picture
of
that
cruelty
and
inhumanity
in
the
nature
of
men
which
i
have
often
contemplated
with
concern
and
which
leads
the
mind
into
a
train
of
very
uncomfortable
and
melancholy
thoughts
it
may
be
said
that
this
barbarous
custom
is
peculiar
to
the
english
and
of
them
only
to
the
lowest
degree
that
it
is
an
excrescence
of
an
uncontrolled
licentiousness
mistaken
for
liberty
and
never
shows
itself
in
men
who
are
polished
and
refined
in
such
manner
as
human
nature
requires
to
produce
that
perfection
of
which
it
is
susceptible
and
to
purge
away
that
malevolence
of
disposition
of
which
at
our
birth
we
partake
in
common
with
the
savage
creation
this
may
be
said
and
this
is
all
that
can
be
said
and
it
is
i
am
afraid
but
little
satisfactory
to
account
for
the
inhumanity
of
those
who
while
they
boast
of
being
made
after
god
own
image
seem
to
bear
in
their
minds
a
resemblance
of
the
vilest
species
of
brutes
or
rather
indeed
of
our
idea
of
devils
for
i
do
know
that
any
brutes
can
be
taxed
with
such
malevolence
a
sirloin
of
beef
was
now
placed
on
the
table
for
which
though
little
better
than
carrion
as
much
was
charged
by
the
master
of
the
little
paltry
who
dressed
it
as
would
have
been
demanded
for
all
the
elegance
of
the
king
arms
or
any
other
polite
tavern
or
for
indeed
the
difference
between
the
best
house
and
the
worst
is
that
at
the
former
you
pay
largely
for
luxury
at
the
latter
for
nothing
thursday
june
this
morning
the
captain
who
lay
on
shore
at
his
own
house
paid
us
a
visit
in
the
cabin
and
behaved
like
an
angry
bashaw
declaring
that
had
he
known
we
were
not
to
be
pleased
he
would
not
have
carried
us
for
five
hundred
pounds
he
added
many
asseverations
that
he
was
a
gentleman
and
despised
money
not
forgetting
several
hints
of
the
presents
which
had
been
made
him
for
his
cabin
of
twenty
thirty
and
forty
guineas
by
several
gentlemen
over
and
above
the
sum
for
which
they
had
contracted
this
behavior
greatly
surprised
me
as
i
knew
not
how
to
account
for
it
nothing
having
happened
since
we
parted
from
the
captain
the
evening
before
in
perfect
good
humor
and
all
this
broke
forth
on
the
first
moment
of
his
arrival
this
morning
he
did
not
however
suffer
my
amazement
to
have
any
long
continuance
before
he
clearly
showed
me
that
all
this
was
meant
only
as
an
apology
to
introduce
another
procrastination
being
the
fifth
of
his
weighing
anchor
which
was
now
postponed
till
saturday
for
such
was
his
will
and
pleasure
besides
the
disagreeable
situation
in
which
we
then
lay
in
the
confines
of
wapping
and
rotherhithe
tasting
a
delicious
mixture
of
the
air
of
both
these
sweet
places
and
enjoying
the
concord
of
sweet
sounds
of
seamen
watermen
and
of
all
the
vociferous
inhabitants
of
both
shores
composing
altogether
a
greater
variety
of
harmony
than
hogarth
imagination
hath
brought
together
in
that
print
of
his
which
is
enough
to
make
a
man
deaf
to
look
at
i
had
a
more
urgent
cause
to
press
our
departure
which
was
that
the
dropsy
for
which
i
had
undergone
three
tappings
seemed
to
threaten
me
with
a
fourth
discharge
before
i
should
reach
lisbon
and
when
i
should
have
nobody
on
board
capable
of
performing
the
operation
but
i
was
obliged
to
hearken
to
the
voice
of
reason
if
i
may
use
the
captain
own
words
and
to
rest
myself
contented
indeed
there
was
no
alternative
within
my
reach
but
what
would
have
cost
me
much
too
dear
there
are
many
evils
in
society
from
which
people
of
the
highest
rank
are
so
entirely
exempt
that
they
have
not
the
least
knowledge
or
idea
of
them
nor
indeed
of
the
characters
which
are
formed
by
them
such
for
instance
is
the
conveyance
of
goods
and
passengers
from
one
place
to
another
now
there
is
no
such
thing
as
any
kind
of
knowledge
contemptible
in
itself
and
as
the
particular
knowledge
i
here
mean
is
entirely
necessary
to
the
well
understanding
and
well
enjoying
this
journal
and
lastly
as
in
this
case
the
most
ignorant
will
be
those
very
readers
whose
amusement
we
chiefly
consult
and
to
whom
we
wish
to
be
supposed
principally
to
write
we
will
here
enter
somewhat
largely
into
the
discussion
of
this
matter
the
rather
for
that
no
ancient
or
modern
author
if
we
can
trust
the
catalogue
of
doctor
mead
library
hath
ever
undertaken
it
but
that
it
seems
in
the
style
of
don
quixote
a
task
reserved
for
my
pen
alone
when
i
first
conceived
this
intention
i
began
to
entertain
thoughts
of
inquiring
into
the
antiquity
of
traveling
and
as
many
persons
have
performed
in
this
way
i
mean
have
traveled
at
the
expense
of
the
public
i
flattered
myself
that
the
spirit
of
improving
arts
and
sciences
and
of
advancing
useful
and
substantial
learning
which
so
eminently
distinguishes
this
age
and
hath
given
rise
to
more
speculative
societies
in
europe
than
i
at
present
can
recollect
the
names
of
perhaps
indeed
than
i
or
any
other
besides
their
very
near
neighbors
ever
heard
mentioned
would
assist
in
promoting
so
curious
a
work
a
work
begun
with
the
same
views
calculated
for
the
same
purposes
and
fitted
for
the
same
uses
with
the
labors
which
those
right
honorable
societies
have
so
cheerfully
undertaken
themselves
and
encouraged
in
others
sometimes
with
the
highest
honors
even
with
admission
into
their
colleges
and
with
enrollment
among
their
members
from
these
societies
i
promised
myself
all
assistance
in
their
power
particularly
the
communication
of
such
valuable
manuscripts
and
records
as
they
must
be
supposed
to
have
collected
from
those
obscure
ages
of
antiquity
when
history
yields
us
such
imperfect
accounts
of
the
residence
and
much
more
imperfect
of
the
travels
of
the
human
race
unless
perhaps
as
a
curious
and
learned
member
of
the
young
society
of
antiquarians
is
said
to
have
hinted
his
conjectures
that
their
residence
and
their
travels
were
one
and
the
same
and
this
discovery
for
such
it
seems
to
be
he
is
said
to
have
owed
to
the
lighting
by
accident
on
a
book
which
we
shall
have
occasion
to
mention
presently
the
contents
of
which
were
then
little
known
to
the
society
the
king
of
prussia
moreover
who
from
a
degree
of
benevolence
and
taste
which
in
either
case
is
a
rare
production
in
so
northern
a
climate
is
the
great
encourager
of
art
and
science
i
was
well
assured
would
promote
so
useful
a
design
and
order
his
archives
to
be
searched
on
my
behalf
but
after
well
weighing
all
these
advantages
and
much
meditation
on
the
order
of
my
work
my
whole
design
was
subverted
in
a
moment
by
hearing
of
the
discovery
just
mentioned
to
have
been
made
by
the
young
antiquarian
who
from
the
most
ancient
record
in
the
world
though
i
do
find
the
society
are
all
agreed
on
this
point
one
long
preceding
the
date
of
the
earliest
modern
collections
either
of
books
or
butterflies
none
of
which
pretend
to
go
beyond
the
flood
shows
us
that
the
first
man
was
a
traveler
and
that
he
and
his
family
were
scarce
settled
in
paradise
before
they
disliked
their
own
home
and
became
passengers
to
another
place
hence
it
appears
that
the
humor
of
traveling
is
as
old
as
the
human
race
and
that
it
was
their
curse
from
the
beginning
by
this
discovery
my
plan
became
much
shortened
and
i
found
it
only
necessary
to
treat
of
the
conveyance
of
goods
and
passengers
from
place
to
place
which
not
being
universally
known
seemed
proper
to
be
explained
before
we
examined
into
its
original
there
are
indeed
two
different
ways
of
tracing
all
things
used
by
the
historian
and
the
antiquary
these
are
upwards
and
downwards
the
former
shows
you
how
things
are
and
leaves
to
others
to
discover
when
they
began
to
be
so
the
latter
shows
you
how
things
were
and
leaves
their
present
existence
to
be
examined
by
others
hence
the
former
is
more
useful
the
latter
more
curious
the
former
receives
the
thanks
of
mankind
the
latter
of
that
valuable
part
the
virtuosi
in
explaining
therefore
this
mystery
of
carrying
goods
and
passengers
from
one
place
to
another
hitherto
so
profound
a
secret
to
the
very
best
of
our
readers
we
shall
pursue
the
historical
method
and
endeavor
to
show
by
what
means
it
is
at
present
performed
referring
the
more
curious
inquiry
either
to
some
other
pen
or
to
some
other
opportunity
now
there
are
two
general
ways
of
performing
if
god
permit
this
conveyance
by
land
and
water
both
of
which
have
much
variety
that
by
land
being
performed
in
different
vehicles
such
as
coaches
caravans
wagons
etc
and
that
by
water
in
ships
barges
and
boats
of
various
sizes
and
denominations
but
as
all
these
methods
of
conveyance
are
formed
on
the
same
principles
they
agree
so
well
together
that
it
is
fully
sufficient
to
comprehend
them
all
in
the
general
view
without
descending
to
such
minute
particulars
as
would
distinguish
one
method
from
another
common
to
all
of
these
is
one
general
principle
that
as
the
goods
to
be
conveyed
are
usually
the
larger
so
they
are
to
be
chiefly
considered
in
the
conveyance
the
owner
being
indeed
little
more
than
an
appendage
to
his
trunk
or
box
or
bale
or
at
best
a
small
part
of
his
own
baggage
very
little
care
is
to
be
taken
in
stowing
or
packing
them
up
with
convenience
to
himself
for
the
conveyance
is
not
of
passengers
and
goods
but
of
goods
and
passengers
secondly
from
this
conveyance
arises
a
new
kind
of
relation
or
rather
of
subjection
in
the
society
by
which
the
passenger
becomes
bound
in
allegiance
to
his
conveyer
this
allegiance
is
indeed
only
temporary
and
local
but
the
most
absolute
during
its
continuance
of
any
known
in
great
britain
and
to
say
truth
scarce
consistent
with
the
liberties
of
a
free
people
nor
could
it
be
reconciled
with
them
did
it
not
move
downwards
a
circumstance
universally
apprehended
to
be
incompatible
to
all
kinds
of
slavery
for
aristotle
in
his
politics
hath
proved
abundantly
to
my
satisfaction
that
no
men
are
born
to
be
slaves
except
barbarians
and
these
only
to
such
as
are
not
themselves
barbarians
and
indeed
montesquieu
hath
carried
it
very
little
farther
in
the
case
of
the
africans
the
real
truth
being
that
no
man
is
born
to
be
a
slave
unless
to
him
who
is
able
to
make
him
so
thirdly
this
subjection
is
absolute
and
consists
of
a
perfect
resignation
both
of
body
and
soul
to
the
disposal
of
another
after
which
resignation
during
a
certain
time
his
subject
retains
no
more
power
over
his
own
will
than
an
asiatic
slave
or
an
english
wife
by
the
laws
of
both
countries
and
by
the
customs
of
one
of
them
if
i
should
mention
the
instance
of
a
many
of
my
readers
would
recognize
the
truth
of
what
i
have
here
observed
all
indeed
that
ever
have
been
under
the
dominion
of
that
tyrant
who
in
this
free
country
is
as
absolute
as
a
turkish
bashaw
in
two
particulars
only
his
power
is
defective
he
can
not
press
you
into
his
service
and
if
you
enter
yourself
at
one
place
on
condition
of
being
discharged
at
a
certain
time
at
another
he
is
obliged
to
perform
his
agreement
if
god
permit
but
all
the
intermediate
time
you
are
absolutely
under
his
government
he
carries
you
how
he
will
when
he
will
and
whither
he
will
provided
it
be
not
much
out
of
the
road
you
have
nothing
to
eat
or
to
drink
but
what
and
when
and
where
he
pleases
nay
you
can
not
sleep
unless
he
pleases
you
should
for
he
will
order
you
sometimes
out
of
bed
at
midnight
and
hurry
you
away
at
a
moment
warning
indeed
if
you
can
sleep
in
his
vehicle
he
can
not
prevent
it
nay
indeed
to
give
him
his
due
this
he
is
ordinarily
disposed
to
encourage
for
the
earlier
he
forces
you
to
rise
in
the
morning
the
more
time
he
will
give
you
in
the
heat
of
the
day
sometimes
even
six
hours
at
an
or
at
their
doors
where
he
always
gives
you
the
same
indulgence
which
he
allows
himself
and
for
this
he
is
generally
very
moderate
in
his
demands
i
have
known
a
whole
bundle
of
passengers
charged
no
more
than
for
being
suffered
to
remain
quiet
at
an
door
for
above
a
whole
hour
and
that
even
in
the
hottest
day
in
summer
but
as
this
kind
of
tyranny
though
it
hath
escaped
our
political
writers
hath
been
i
think
touched
by
our
dramatic
and
is
more
trite
among
the
generality
of
readers
and
as
this
and
all
other
kinds
of
such
subjection
are
alike
unknown
to
my
friends
i
will
quit
the
passengers
by
land
and
treat
of
those
who
travel
by
water
for
whatever
is
said
on
this
subject
is
applicable
to
both
alike
and
we
may
bring
them
together
as
closely
as
they
are
brought
in
the
liturgy
when
they
are
recommended
to
the
prayers
of
all
christian
congregations
and
which
i
have
often
thought
very
remarkable
where
they
are
joined
with
other
miserable
wretches
such
as
women
in
labor
people
in
sickness
infants
just
born
prisoners
and
captives
goods
and
passengers
are
conveyed
by
water
in
divers
vehicles
the
principal
of
which
being
a
ship
it
shall
suffice
to
mention
that
alone
here
the
tyrant
doth
not
derive
his
title
as
the
doth
from
the
vehicle
itself
in
which
he
stows
his
goods
and
passengers
but
he
is
called
the
captain
a
word
of
such
various
use
and
uncertain
signification
that
it
seems
very
difficult
to
fix
any
positive
idea
to
it
if
indeed
there
be
any
general
meaning
which
may
comprehend
all
its
different
uses
that
of
the
head
or
chief
of
any
body
of
men
seems
to
be
most
capable
of
this
comprehension
for
whether
they
be
a
company
of
soldiers
a
crew
of
sailors
or
a
gang
of
rogues
he
who
is
at
the
head
of
them
is
always
styled
the
captain
the
particular
tyrant
whose
fortune
it
was
to
stow
us
aboard
laid
a
farther
claim
to
this
appellation
than
the
bare
command
of
a
vehicle
of
conveyance
he
had
been
the
captain
of
a
privateer
which
he
chose
to
call
being
in
the
king
service
and
thence
derived
a
right
of
hoisting
the
military
ornament
of
a
cockade
over
the
button
of
his
hat
he
likewise
wore
a
sword
of
no
ordinary
length
by
his
side
with
which
he
swaggered
in
his
cabin
among
the
wretches
his
passengers
whom
he
had
stowed
in
cupboards
on
each
side
he
was
a
person
of
a
very
singular
character
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
that
he
was
a
gentleman
from
those
very
reasons
that
proved
he
was
not
one
and
to
show
himself
a
fine
gentleman
by
a
behavior
which
seemed
to
insinuate
he
had
never
seen
one
he
was
moreover
a
man
of
gallantry
at
the
age
of
seventy
he
had
the
finicalness
of
sir
courtly
nice
with
the
roughness
of
surly
and
while
he
was
deaf
himself
had
a
voice
capable
of
deafening
all
others
now
as
i
saw
myself
in
danger
by
the
delays
of
the
captain
who
was
in
reality
waiting
for
more
freight
and
as
the
wind
had
been
long
nested
as
it
were
in
the
southwest
where
it
constantly
blew
hurricanes
i
began
with
great
reason
to
apprehend
that
our
voyage
might
be
long
and
that
my
belly
which
began
already
to
be
much
extended
would
require
the
water
to
be
let
out
at
a
time
when
no
assistance
was
at
hand
though
indeed
the
captain
comforted
me
with
assurances
that
he
had
a
pretty
young
fellow
on
board
who
acted
as
his
surgeon
as
i
found
he
likewise
did
as
steward
cook
butler
sailor
in
short
he
had
as
many
offices
as
scrub
in
the
play
and
went
through
them
all
with
great
dexterity
this
of
surgeon
was
perhaps
the
only
one
in
which
his
skill
was
somewhat
deficient
at
least
that
branch
of
tapping
for
the
dropsy
for
he
very
ingenuously
and
modestly
confessed
he
had
never
seen
the
operation
performed
nor
was
possessed
of
that
chirurgical
instrument
with
which
it
is
performed
friday
june
by
way
of
prevention
therefore
i
this
day
sent
for
my
friend
hunter
the
great
surgeon
and
anatomist
of
and
though
my
belly
was
not
yet
very
full
and
tight
let
out
ten
quarts
of
water
the
young
attended
the
operation
not
as
a
performer
but
as
a
student
i
was
now
eased
of
the
greatest
apprehension
which
i
had
from
the
length
of
the
passage
and
i
told
the
captain
i
was
become
indifferent
as
to
the
time
of
his
sailing
he
expressed
much
satisfaction
in
this
declaration
and
at
hearing
from
me
that
i
found
myself
since
my
tapping
much
lighter
and
better
in
this
i
believe
he
was
sincere
for
he
was
as
we
shall
have
occasion
to
observe
more
than
once
a
very
man
and
as
he
was
a
very
brave
one
too
i
found
that
the
heroic
constancy
with
which
i
had
borne
an
operation
that
is
attended
with
scarce
any
degree
of
pain
had
not
a
little
raised
me
in
his
esteem
that
he
might
adhere
therefore
in
the
most
religious
and
rigorous
manner
to
his
word
when
he
had
no
longer
any
temptation
from
interest
to
break
it
as
he
had
no
longer
any
hopes
of
more
goods
or
passengers
he
ordered
his
ship
to
fall
down
to
gravesend
on
sunday
morning
and
there
to
wait
his
arrival
sunday
june
nothing
worth
notice
passed
till
that
morning
when
my
poor
wife
after
passing
a
night
in
the
utmost
torments
of
the
toothache
resolved
to
have
it
drawn
i
despatched
therefore
a
servant
into
wapping
to
bring
in
haste
the
best
he
could
find
he
soon
found
out
a
female
of
great
eminence
in
the
art
but
when
he
brought
her
to
the
boat
at
the
waterside
they
were
informed
that
the
ship
was
gone
for
indeed
she
had
set
out
a
few
minutes
after
his
quitting
her
nor
did
the
pilot
who
well
knew
the
errand
on
which
i
had
sent
my
servant
think
fit
to
wait
a
moment
for
his
return
or
to
give
me
any
notice
of
his
setting
out
though
i
had
very
patiently
attended
the
delays
of
the
captain
four
days
after
many
solemn
promises
of
weighing
anchor
every
one
of
the
three
last
but
of
all
the
petty
bashaws
or
turbulent
tyrants
i
ever
beheld
this
pilot
was
the
worst
tempered
for
during
the
time
that
he
had
the
guidance
of
the
ship
which
was
till
we
arrived
in
the
downs
he
complied
with
no
desires
nor
did
he
give
a
civil
word
or
indeed
a
civil
look
to
any
on
board
the
who
as
i
said
before
was
one
of
great
eminence
among
her
neighbors
refused
to
follow
the
ship
so
that
my
man
made
himself
the
best
of
his
way
and
with
some
difficulty
came
up
with
us
before
we
were
got
under
full
sail
for
after
that
as
we
had
both
wind
and
tide
with
us
he
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
overtake
the
ship
till
she
was
come
to
an
anchor
at
gravesend
the
morning
was
fair
and
bright
and
we
had
a
passage
thither
i
think
as
pleasant
as
can
be
conceived
for
take
it
with
all
its
advantages
particularly
the
number
of
fine
ships
you
are
always
sure
of
seeing
by
the
way
there
is
nothing
to
equal
it
in
all
the
rivers
of
the
world
the
yards
of
deptford
and
of
woolwich
are
noble
sights
and
give
us
a
just
idea
of
the
great
perfection
to
which
we
are
arrived
in
building
those
floating
castles
and
the
figure
which
we
may
always
make
in
europe
among
the
other
maritime
powers
that
of
woolwich
at
least
very
strongly
imprinted
this
idea
on
my
mind
for
there
was
now
on
the
stocks
there
the
royal
anne
supposed
to
be
the
largest
ship
ever
built
and
which
contains
ten
more
than
had
ever
yet
equipped
a
it
is
true
perhaps
that
there
is
more
of
ostentation
than
of
real
utility
in
ships
of
this
vast
and
unwieldy
burden
which
are
rarely
capable
of
acting
against
an
enemy
but
if
the
building
such
contributes
to
preserve
among
other
nations
the
notion
of
the
british
superiority
in
naval
affairs
the
expense
though
very
great
is
well
incurred
and
the
ostentation
is
laudable
and
truly
political
indeed
i
should
be
sorry
to
allow
that
holland
france
or
spain
possessed
a
vessel
larger
and
more
beautiful
than
the
largest
and
most
beautiful
of
ours
for
this
honor
i
would
always
administer
to
the
pride
of
our
sailors
who
should
challenge
it
from
all
their
neighbors
with
truth
and
success
and
sure
i
am
that
not
our
honest
tars
alone
but
every
inhabitant
of
this
island
may
exult
in
the
comparison
when
he
considers
the
king
of
great
britain
as
a
maritime
prince
in
opposition
to
any
other
prince
in
europe
but
i
am
not
so
certain
that
the
same
idea
of
superiority
will
result
from
comparing
our
land
forces
with
those
of
many
other
crowned
heads
in
numbers
they
all
far
exceed
us
and
in
the
goodness
and
splendor
of
their
troops
many
nations
particularly
the
germans
and
french
and
perhaps
the
dutch
cast
us
at
a
distance
for
however
we
may
flatter
ourselves
with
the
edwards
and
henrys
of
former
ages
the
change
of
the
whole
art
of
war
since
those
days
by
which
the
advantage
of
personal
strength
is
in
a
manner
entirely
lost
hath
produced
a
change
in
military
affairs
to
the
advantage
of
our
enemies
as
for
our
successes
in
later
days
if
they
were
not
entirely
owing
to
the
superior
genius
of
our
general
they
were
not
a
little
due
to
the
superior
force
of
his
money
indeed
if
we
should
arraign
marshal
saxe
of
ostentation
when
he
showed
his
army
drawn
up
to
our
captive
general
the
day
after
the
battle
of
la
val
we
can
not
say
that
the
ostentation
was
entirely
vain
since
he
certainly
showed
him
an
army
which
had
not
been
often
equaled
either
in
the
number
or
goodness
of
the
troops
and
which
in
those
respects
so
far
exceeded
ours
that
none
can
ever
cast
any
reflection
on
the
brave
young
prince
who
could
not
reap
the
laurels
of
conquest
in
that
day
but
his
retreat
will
be
always
mentioned
as
an
addition
to
his
glory
in
our
marine
the
case
is
entirely
the
reverse
and
it
must
be
our
own
fault
if
it
doth
not
continue
so
for
continue
so
it
will
as
long
as
the
flourishing
state
of
our
trade
shall
support
it
and
this
support
it
can
never
want
till
our
legislature
shall
cease
to
give
sufficient
attention
to
the
protection
of
our
trade
and
our
magistrates
want
sufficient
power
ability
and
honesty
to
execute
the
laws
a
circumstance
not
to
be
apprehended
as
it
can
not
happen
till
our
senates
and
our
benches
shall
be
filled
with
the
blindest
ignorance
or
with
the
blackest
corruption
besides
the
ships
in
the
docks
we
saw
many
on
the
water
the
yachts
are
sights
of
great
parade
and
the
king
body
yacht
is
i
believe
unequaled
in
any
country
for
convenience
as
well
as
magnificence
both
which
are
consulted
in
building
and
equipping
her
with
the
most
exquisite
art
and
workmanship
we
saw
likewise
several
indiamen
just
returned
from
their
voyage
these
are
i
believe
the
largest
and
finest
vessels
which
are
anywhere
employed
in
commercial
affairs
the
colliers
likewise
which
are
very
numerous
and
even
assemble
in
fleets
are
ships
of
great
bulk
and
if
we
descend
to
those
used
in
the
american
african
and
european
trades
and
pass
through
those
which
visit
our
own
coasts
to
the
small
craft
that
lie
between
chatham
and
the
tower
the
whole
forms
a
most
pleasing
object
to
the
eye
as
well
as
highly
warming
to
the
heart
of
an
englishman
who
has
any
degree
of
love
for
his
country
or
can
recognize
any
effect
of
the
patriot
in
his
constitution
lastly
the
royal
hospital
at
greenwich
which
presents
so
delightful
a
front
to
the
water
and
doth
such
honor
at
once
to
its
builder
and
the
nation
to
the
great
skill
and
ingenuity
of
the
one
and
to
the
no
less
sensible
gratitude
of
the
other
very
properly
closes
the
account
of
this
scene
which
may
well
appear
romantic
to
those
who
have
not
themselves
seen
that
in
this
one
instance
truth
and
reality
are
capable
perhaps
of
exceeding
the
power
of
fiction
when
we
had
passed
by
greenwich
we
saw
only
two
or
three
gentlemen
houses
all
of
very
moderate
account
till
we
reached
gravesend
these
are
all
on
the
kentish
shore
which
affords
a
much
dryer
wholesomer
and
pleasanter
situation
than
doth
that
of
its
opposite
essex
this
circumstance
i
own
is
somewhat
surprising
to
me
when
i
reflect
on
the
numerous
villas
that
crowd
the
river
from
chelsea
upwards
as
far
as
shepperton
where
the
narrower
channel
affords
not
half
so
noble
a
prospect
and
where
the
continual
succession
of
the
small
craft
like
the
frequent
repetition
of
all
things
which
have
nothing
in
them
great
beautiful
or
admirable
tire
the
eye
and
give
us
distaste
and
aversion
instead
of
pleasure
with
some
of
these
situations
such
as
barnes
mortlake
even
the
shore
of
essex
might
contend
not
upon
very
unequal
terms
but
on
the
kentish
borders
there
are
many
spots
to
be
chosen
by
the
builder
which
might
justly
claim
the
preference
over
almost
the
very
finest
of
those
in
middlesex
and
surrey
how
shall
we
account
for
this
depravity
in
taste
for
surely
there
are
none
so
very
mean
and
contemptible
as
to
bring
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
number
of
little
wherries
gliding
along
after
one
another
in
competition
with
what
we
enjoy
in
viewing
a
succession
of
ships
with
all
their
sails
expanded
to
the
winds
bounding
over
the
waves
before
us
and
here
i
can
not
pass
by
another
observation
on
the
deplorable
want
of
taste
in
our
enjoyments
which
we
show
by
almost
totally
neglecting
the
pursuit
of
what
seems
to
me
the
highest
degree
of
amusement
this
is
the
sailing
ourselves
in
little
vessels
of
our
own
contrived
only
for
our
ease
and
accommodation
to
which
such
situations
of
our
villas
as
i
have
recommended
would
be
so
convenient
and
even
necessary
this
amusement
i
confess
if
enjoyed
in
any
perfection
would
be
of
the
expensive
kind
but
such
expense
would
not
exceed
the
reach
of
a
moderate
fortune
and
would
fall
very
short
of
the
prices
which
are
daily
paid
for
pleasures
of
a
far
inferior
rate
the
truth
i
believe
is
that
sailing
in
the
manner
i
have
just
mentioned
is
a
pleasure
rather
unknown
or
unthought
of
than
rejected
by
those
who
have
experienced
it
unless
perhaps
the
apprehension
of
danger
or
seasickness
may
be
supposed
by
the
timorous
and
delicate
to
make
too
large
deductions
insisting
that
all
their
enjoyments
shall
come
to
them
pure
and
unmixed
and
being
ever
ready
to
cry
out
nocet
empta
dolore
voluptas
this
however
was
my
present
case
for
the
ease
and
lightness
which
i
felt
from
my
tapping
the
gayety
of
the
morning
the
pleasant
sailing
with
wind
and
tide
and
the
many
agreeable
objects
with
which
i
was
constantly
entertained
during
the
whole
way
were
all
suppressed
and
overcome
by
the
single
consideration
of
my
wife
pain
which
continued
incessantly
to
torment
her
till
we
came
to
an
anchor
when
i
dispatched
a
messenger
in
great
haste
for
the
best
reputed
operator
in
gravesend
a
surgeon
of
some
eminence
now
appeared
who
did
not
decline
though
he
certainly
would
have
been
offended
with
the
appellation
of
no
less
than
his
brethren
the
members
of
that
venerable
body
would
be
with
that
of
barber
since
the
late
separation
between
those
companies
by
which
if
the
surgeons
have
gained
much
the
barbers
are
supposed
to
have
lost
very
little
this
able
and
careful
person
for
so
i
sincerely
believe
he
is
after
examining
the
guilty
tooth
declared
that
it
was
such
a
rotten
shell
and
so
placed
at
the
very
remotest
end
of
the
upper
jaw
where
it
was
in
a
manner
covered
and
secured
by
a
large
fine
firm
tooth
that
he
despaired
of
his
power
of
drawing
it
he
said
indeed
more
to
my
wife
and
used
more
rhetoric
to
dissuade
her
from
having
it
drawn
than
is
generally
employed
to
persuade
young
ladies
to
prefer
a
pain
of
three
moments
to
one
of
three
continuance
especially
if
those
young
ladies
happen
to
be
past
forty
and
fifty
years
of
age
when
by
submitting
to
support
a
racking
torment
the
only
good
circumstance
attending
which
is
it
is
so
short
that
scarce
one
in
a
thousand
can
cry
out
i
feel
it
they
are
to
do
a
violence
to
their
charms
and
lose
one
of
those
beautiful
holders
with
which
alone
sir
courtly
nice
declares
a
lady
can
ever
lay
hold
of
his
heart
he
said
at
last
so
much
and
seemed
to
reason
so
justly
that
i
came
over
to
his
side
and
assisted
him
in
prevailing
on
my
wife
for
it
was
no
easy
matter
to
resolve
on
keeping
her
tooth
a
little
longer
and
to
apply
palliatives
only
for
relief
these
were
opium
applied
to
the
tooth
and
blisters
behind
the
ears
whilst
we
were
at
dinner
this
day
in
the
cabin
on
a
sudden
the
window
on
one
side
was
beat
into
the
room
with
a
crash
as
if
a
had
been
discharged
among
us
we
were
all
alarmed
at
the
suddenness
of
the
accident
for
which
however
we
were
soon
able
to
account
for
the
sash
which
was
shivered
all
to
pieces
was
pursued
into
the
middle
of
the
cabin
by
the
bowsprit
of
a
little
ship
called
a
the
master
of
which
made
us
amends
for
running
carelessly
at
best
against
us
and
injuring
the
ship
in
the
that
is
to
say
by
damning
us
all
to
hell
and
uttering
several
pious
wishes
that
it
had
done
us
much
more
mischief
all
which
were
answered
in
their
own
kind
and
phrase
by
our
men
between
whom
and
the
other
crew
a
dialogue
of
oaths
and
scurrility
was
carried
on
as
long
as
they
continued
in
each
hearing
it
is
difficult
i
think
to
assign
a
satisfactory
reason
why
sailors
in
general
should
of
all
others
think
themselves
entirely
discharged
from
the
common
bands
of
humanity
and
should
seem
to
glory
in
the
language
and
behavior
of
savages
they
see
more
of
the
world
and
have
most
of
them
a
more
erudite
education
than
is
the
portion
of
landmen
of
their
degree
nor
do
i
believe
that
in
any
country
they
visit
holland
itself
not
excepted
they
can
ever
find
a
parallel
to
what
daily
passes
on
the
river
thames
is
it
that
they
think
true
courage
for
they
are
the
bravest
fellows
upon
earth
inconsistent
with
all
the
gentleness
of
a
humane
carriage
and
that
the
contempt
of
civil
order
springs
up
in
minds
but
little
cultivated
at
the
same
time
and
from
the
same
principles
with
the
contempt
of
danger
and
death
is
it
in
short
it
is
so
and
how
it
comes
to
be
so
i
leave
to
form
a
question
in
the
robin
hood
society
or
to
be
propounded
for
solution
among
the
enigmas
in
the
woman
almanac
for
the
next
year
monday
july
this
day
welch
took
his
leave
of
me
after
dinner
as
did
a
young
lady
of
her
sister
who
was
proceeding
with
my
wife
to
lisbon
they
both
set
out
together
in
a
for
london
soon
after
their
departure
our
cabin
where
my
wife
and
i
were
sitting
together
was
visited
by
two
ruffians
whose
appearance
greatly
corresponded
with
that
of
the
sheriffs
or
rather
the
bailiffs
one
of
these
especially
who
seemed
to
affect
a
more
than
ordinary
degree
of
rudeness
and
insolence
came
in
without
any
kind
of
ceremony
with
a
broad
gold
lace
on
his
hat
which
was
cocked
with
much
military
fierceness
on
his
head
an
inkhorn
at
his
buttonhole
and
some
papers
in
his
hand
sufficiently
assured
me
what
he
was
and
i
asked
him
if
he
and
his
companion
were
not
officers
he
answered
with
sufficient
dignity
that
they
were
as
an
information
which
he
seemed
to
conclude
would
strike
the
hearer
with
awe
and
suppress
all
further
inquiry
but
on
the
contrary
i
proceeded
to
ask
of
what
rank
he
was
in
the
and
receiving
an
answer
from
his
companion
as
i
remember
that
the
gentleman
was
a
riding
surveyor
i
replied
that
he
might
be
a
riding
surveyor
but
could
be
no
gentleman
for
that
none
who
had
any
title
to
that
denomination
would
break
into
the
presence
of
a
lady
without
an
apology
or
even
moving
his
hat
he
then
took
his
covering
from
his
head
and
laid
it
on
the
table
saying
he
asked
pardon
and
blamed
the
mate
who
should
he
said
have
informed
him
if
any
persons
of
distinction
were
below
i
told
him
he
might
guess
by
our
appearance
which
perhaps
was
rather
more
than
could
be
said
with
the
strictest
adherence
to
truth
that
he
was
before
a
gentleman
and
lady
which
should
teach
him
to
be
very
civil
in
his
behavior
though
we
should
not
happen
to
be
of
that
number
whom
the
world
calls
people
of
fashion
and
distinction
however
i
said
that
as
he
seemed
sensible
of
his
error
and
had
asked
pardon
the
lady
would
permit
him
to
put
his
hat
on
again
if
he
chose
it
this
he
refused
with
some
degree
of
surliness
and
failed
not
to
convince
me
that
if
i
should
condescend
to
become
more
gentle
he
would
soon
grow
more
rude
i
now
renewed
a
reflection
which
i
have
often
seen
occasion
to
make
that
there
is
nothing
so
incongruous
in
nature
as
any
kind
of
power
with
lowness
of
mind
and
of
ability
and
that
there
is
nothing
more
deplorable
than
the
want
of
truth
in
the
whimsical
notion
of
plato
who
tells
us
that
saturn
well
knowing
the
state
of
human
affairs
gave
us
kings
and
rulers
not
of
human
but
divine
original
for
as
we
make
not
shepherds
of
sheep
nor
oxherds
of
oxen
nor
goatherds
of
goats
but
place
some
of
our
own
kind
over
all
as
being
better
and
fitter
to
govern
them
in
the
same
manner
were
demons
by
the
divine
love
set
over
us
as
a
race
of
beings
of
a
superior
order
to
men
and
who
with
great
ease
to
themselves
might
regulate
our
affairs
and
establish
peace
modesty
freedom
and
justice
and
totally
destroying
all
sedition
might
complete
the
happiness
of
the
human
race
so
far
at
least
may
even
now
be
said
with
truth
that
in
all
states
which
are
under
the
government
of
mere
man
without
any
divine
assistance
there
is
nothing
but
labor
and
misery
to
be
found
from
what
i
have
said
therefore
we
may
at
least
learn
with
our
utmost
endeavors
to
imitate
the
saturnian
institution
borrowing
all
assistance
from
our
immortal
part
while
we
pay
to
this
the
strictest
obedience
we
should
form
both
our
private
economy
and
public
policy
from
its
dictates
by
this
dispensation
of
our
immortal
minds
we
are
to
establish
a
law
and
to
call
it
by
that
name
but
if
any
government
be
in
the
hands
of
a
single
person
of
the
few
or
of
the
many
and
such
governor
or
governors
shall
abandon
himself
or
themselves
to
the
unbridled
pursuit
of
the
wildest
pleasures
or
desires
unable
to
restrain
any
passion
but
possessed
with
an
insatiable
bad
disease
if
such
shall
attempt
to
govern
and
at
the
same
time
to
trample
on
all
laws
there
can
be
no
means
of
preservation
left
for
the
wretched
people
plato

serrani
it
is
true
that
plato
is
here
treating
of
the
highest
or
sovereign
power
in
a
state
but
it
is
as
true
that
his
observations
are
general
and
may
be
applied
to
all
inferior
powers
and
indeed
every
subordinate
degree
is
immediately
derived
from
the
highest
and
as
it
is
equally
protected
by
the
same
force
and
sanctified
by
the
same
authority
is
alike
dangerous
to
the
of
the
subject
of
all
powers
perhaps
there
is
none
so
sanctified
and
protected
as
this
which
is
under
our
present
consideration
so
numerous
indeed
and
strong
are
the
sanctions
given
to
it
by
many
acts
of
parliament
that
having
once
established
the
laws
of
customs
on
merchandise
it
seems
to
have
been
the
sole
view
of
the
legislature
to
strengthen
the
hands
and
to
protect
the
persons
of
the
officers
who
became
established
by
those
laws
many
of
whom
are
so
far
from
bearing
any
resemblance
to
the
saturnian
institution
and
to
be
chosen
from
a
degree
of
beings
superior
to
the
rest
of
human
race
that
they
sometimes
seem
industriously
picked
out
of
the
lowest
and
vilest
orders
of
mankind
there
is
indeed
nothing
so
useful
to
man
in
general
nor
so
beneficial
to
particular
societies
and
individuals
as
trade
this
is
that
alma
mater
at
whose
plentiful
breast
all
mankind
are
nourished
it
is
true
like
other
parents
she
is
not
always
equally
indulgent
to
all
her
children
but
though
she
gives
to
her
favorites
a
vast
proportion
of
redundancy
and
superfluity
there
are
very
few
whom
she
refuses
to
supply
with
the
conveniences
and
none
with
the
necessaries
of
life
such
a
benefactress
as
this
must
naturally
be
beloved
by
mankind
in
general
it
would
be
wonderful
therefore
if
her
interest
was
not
considered
by
them
and
protected
from
the
fraud
and
violence
of
some
of
her
rebellious
offspring
who
coveting
more
than
their
share
or
more
than
she
thinks
proper
to
allow
them
are
daily
employed
in
meditating
mischief
against
her
and
in
endeavoring
to
steal
from
their
brethren
those
shares
which
this
great
alma

had
allowed
them
at
length
our

island
of
thanet
which
is
an
island
and
that
of
sheppy
which
is
not
an
island
and
about
three
o
the
wind
being
now
full
in
our
teeth
we
came
to
an
anchor
in
the
downs
within
two
miles
of
my
wife
having
suffered
intolerable
pain
from
her
tooth
again
renewed
her
resolution
of
having
it
drawn
and
another
surgeon
was
sent
for
from
deal
but
with
no
better
success
than
the
former
he
likewise
declined
the
operation
for
the
same
reason
which
had
been
assigned
by
the
former
however
such
was
her
resolution
backed
with
pain
that
he
was
obliged
to
make
the
attempt
which
concluded
more
in
honor
of
his
judgment
than
of
his
operation
for
after
having
put
my
poor
wife
to
inexpressible
torment
he
was
obliged
to
leave
her
tooth
in
statu
quo
and
she
had
now
the
comfortable
prospect
of
a
long
fit
of
pain
which
might
have
lasted
her
whole
voyage
without
any
possibility
of
relief
in
these
pleasing
sensations
of
which
i
had
my
just
share
nature
overcome
with
fatigue
about
eight
in
the
evening
resigned
her
to
rest
a
circumstance
which
would
have
given
me
some
happiness
could
i
have
known
how
to
employ
those
spirits
which
were
raised
by
it
but
unfortunately
for
me
i
was
left
in
a
disposition
of
enjoying
an
agreeable
hour
without
the
assistance
of
a
companion
which
has
always
appeared
to
me
necessary
to
such
enjoyment
my
daughter
and
her
companion
were
both
retired
to
bed
the
other
passengers
were
a
rude
of
fourteen
years
old
and
an
illiterate
portuguese
friar
who
understood
no
language
but
his
own
in
which
i
had
not
the
least
smattering
the
captain
was
the
only
person
left
in
whose
conversation
i
might
indulge
myself
but
unluckily
besides
a
total
ignorance
of
everything
in
the
world
but
a
ship
he
had
the
misfortune
of
being
so
deaf
that
to
make
him
hear
i
will
not
say
understand
my
words
i
must
run
the
risk
of
conveying
them
to
the
ears
of
my
wife
who
though
in
another
room
called
i
think
the
being
indeed
a
most
stately
apartment
capable
of
containing
one
human
body
in
length
if
not
very
tall
and
three
bodies
in
breadth
lay
asleep
within
a
yard
of
me
in
this
situation
necessity
and
choice
were
one
and
the
same
thing
the
captain
and
i
sat
down
together
to
a
small
bowl
of
punch
over
which
we
both
soon
fell
fast
asleep
and
so
concluded
the
evening
wednesday
july
this
morning
i
awaked
at
four
for
my
distemper
seldom
suffered
me
to
sleep
later
i
presently
got
up
and
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
the
sight
of
a
tempestuous
sea
for
four
hours
before
the
captain
was
stirring
for
he
loved
to
indulge
himself
in
morning
slumbers
which
were
attended
with
a
much
more
agreeable
to
the
performers
than
to
the
hearers
especially
such
as
have
as
i
had
the
privilege
of
sitting
in
the
orchestra
at
eight
o
the
captain
rose
and
sent
his
boat
on
shore
i
ordered
my
man
likewise
to
go
in
it
as
my
distemper
was
not
of
that
kind
which
entirely
deprives
us
of
appetite
now
though
the
captain
had
well
victualled
his
ship
with
all
manner
of
salt
provisions
for
the
voyage
and
had
added
great
quantities
of
fresh
stores
particularly
of
vegetables
at
gravesend
such
as
beans
and
peas
which
had
been
on
board
only
two
days
and
had
possibly
not
been
gathered
above
two
more
i
apprehended
i
could
provide
better
for
myself
at
deal
than
the
ordinary
seemed
to
promise
i
accordingly
sent
for
fresh
provisions
of
all
kinds
from
the
shore
in
order
to
put
off
the
evil
day
of
starving
as
long
as
possible
my
man
returned
with
most
of
the
articles
i
sent
for
and
i
now
thought
myself
in
a
condition
of
living
a
week
on
my
own
provisions
i
therefore
ordered
my
own
dinner
which
i
wanted
nothing
but
a
cook
to
dress
and
a
proper
fire
to
dress
it
at
but
those
were
not
to
be
had
nor
indeed
any
addition
to
my
roast
mutton
except
the
pleasure
of
the
captain
company
with
that
of
the
other
passengers
for
my
wife
continued
the
whole
day
in
a
state
of
dozing
and
my
other
females
whose
sickness
did
not
abate
by
the
rolling
of
the
ship
at
anchor
seemed
more
inclined
to
empty
their
stomachs
than
to
fill
them
thus
i
passed
the
whole
day
except
about
an
hour
at
dinner
by
myself
and
the
evening
concluded
with
the
captain
as
the
preceding
one
had
done
one
comfortable
piece
of
news
he
communicated
to
me
which
was
that
he
had
no
doubt
of
a
prosperous
wind
in
the
morning
but
as
he
did
not
divulge
the
reasons
of
this
confidence
and
as
i
saw
none
myself
besides
the
wind
being
directly
opposite
my
faith
in
this
prophecy
was
not
strong
enough
to
build
any
great
hopes
upon
thursday
july
this
morning
however
the
captain
seemed
resolved
to
fulfill
his
own
predictions
whether
the
wind
would
or
no
he
accordingly
weighed
anchor
and
taking
the
advantage
of
the
tide
when
the
wind
was
not
very
boisterous
he
hoisted
his
sails
and
as
if
his
power
had
been
no
less
absolute
over
aeolus
than
it
was
over
neptune
he
forced
the
wind
to
blow
him
on
in
its
own
despite
but
as
all
men
who
have
ever
been
at
sea
well
know
how
weak
such
attempts
are
and
want
no
authorities
of
scripture
to
prove
that
the
most
absolute
power
of
a
captain
of
a
ship
is
very
contemptible
in
the
wind
eye
so
did
it
befall
our
noble
commander
who
having
struggled
with
the
wind
three
or
four
hours
was
obliged
to
give
over
and
lost
in
a
few
minutes
all
that
he
had
been
so
long
in
short
we
returned
to
our
former
station
and
once
more
cast
anchor
in
the
neighborhood
of
deal
here
though
we
lay
near
the
shore
that
we
might
promise
ourselves
all
the
emolument
which
could
be
derived
from
it
we
found
ourselves
deceived
and
that
we
might
with
as
much
conveniency
be
out
of
the
sight
of
land
for
except
when
the
captain
launched
forth
his
own
boat
which
he
did
always
with
great
reluctance
we
were
incapable
of
procuring
anything
from
deal
but
at
a
price
too
exorbitant
and
beyond
the
reach
even
of
modern
luxury
the
fare
of
a
boat
from
deal
which
lay
at
two
miles
distance
being
at
least
three
and
if
we
had
been
in
any
distress
for
it
as
many
for
these
good
people
consider
the
sea
as
a
large
common
appendant
to
their
manor
in
which
when
they
find
any
of
their
impounded
they
conclude
that
they
have
a
full
right
of
making
them
pay
at
their
own
discretion
for
their
deliverance
to
say
the
truth
whether
it
be
that
men
who
live
on
the
are
of
an
amphibious
kind
and
do
not
entirely
partake
of
human
nature
or
whatever
else
may
be
the
reason
they
are
so
far
from
taking
any
share
in
the
distresses
of
mankind
or
of
being
moved
with
any
compassion
for
them
that
they
look
upon
them
as
blessings
showered
down
from
above
and
which
the
more
they
improve
to
their
own
use
the
greater
is
their
gratitude
and
piety
thus
at
gravesend
a
sculler
requires
a
shilling
for
going
less
way
than
he
would
row
in
london
for
threepence
and
at
deal
a
boat
often
brings
more
profit
in
a
day
than
it
can
produce
in
london
in
a
week
or
perhaps
in
a
month
in
both
places
the
owner
of
the
boat
founds
his
demand
on
the
necessity
and
distress
of
one
who
stands
more
or
less
in
absolute
want
of
his
assistance
and
with
the
urgency
of
these
always
rises
in
the
exorbitancy
of
his
demand
without
ever
considering
that
from
these
very
circumstances
the
power
or
ease
of
gratifying
such
demand
is
in
like
proportion
lessened
now
as
i
am
unwilling
that
some
conclusions
which
may
be
i
am
aware
too
justly
drawn
from
these
observations
should
be
imputed
to
human
nature
in
general
i
have
endeavored
to
account
for
them
in
a
way
more
consistent
with
the
goodness
and
dignity
of
that
nature
however
it
be
it
seems
a
little
to
reflect
on
the
governors
of
such
monsters
that
they
do
not
take
some
means
to
restrain
these
impositions
and
prevent
them
from
triumphing
any
longer
in
the
miseries
of
those
who
are
in
many
circumstances
at
least
their
and
considering
the
distresses
of
a
wretched
seaman
from
his
being
wrecked
to
his
being
barely
windbound
as
a
blessing
sent
among
them
from
above
and
calling
it
by
that
blasphemous
name
friday
july
this
day
i
sent
a
servant
on
board
a
that
was
stationed
here
with
my
compliments
to
the
captain
to
represent
to
him
the
distress
of
the
ladies
and
to
desire
the
favor
of
his
to
conduct
us
to
dover
at
about
seven
miles
distance
and
at
the
same
time
presumed
to
make
use
of
a
great
lady
name
the
wife
of
the
first
lord
commissioner
of
the
admiralty
who
would
i
told
him
be
pleased
with
any
kindness
shown
by
him
towards
us
in
our
miserable
condition
and
this
i
am
convinced
was
true
from
the
humanity
of
the
lady
though
she
was
entirely
unknown
to
me
the
captain
returned
a
verbal
answer
to
a
long
letter
acquainting
me
that
what
i
desired
could
not
be
complied
with
it
being
a
favor
not
in
his
power
to
grant
this
might
be
and
i
suppose
was
true
but
it
is
as
true
that
if
he
was
able
to
write
and
had
pen
ink
and
paper
on
board
he
might
have
sent
a
written
answer
and
that
it
was
the
part
of
a
gentleman
so
to
have
done
but
this
is
a
character
seldom
maintained
on
the
watery
element
especially
by
those
who
exercise
any
power
on
it
every
commander
of
a
vessel
here
seems
to
think
himself
entirely
free
from
all
those
rules
of
decency
and
civility
which
direct
and
restrain
the
conduct
of
the
members
of
a
society
on
shore
and
each
claiming
absolute
dominion
in
his
little
wooden
world
rules
by
his
own
laws
and
his
own
discretion
i
do
not
indeed
know
so
pregnant
an
instance
of
the
dangerous
consequences
of
absolute
power
and
its
aptness
to
intoxicate
the
mind
as
that
of
those
petty
tyrants
who
become
such
in
a
moment
from
very
and
social
members
of
that
communion
in
which
they
affect
no
superiority
but
live
in
an
orderly
state
of
legal
subjection
with
their
saturday
july
this
morning
our
commander
declaring
he
was
sure
the
wind
would
change
took
the
advantage
of
an
ebbing
tide
and
weighed
his
anchor
his
assurance
however
had
the
same
completion
and
his
endeavors
the
same
success
with
his
formal
trial
and
he
was
soon
obliged
to
return
once
more
to
his
old
quarters
just
before
we
let
go
our
anchor
a
small
sloop
rather
than
submit
to
yield
us
an
inch
of
way
ran
foul
of
our
ship
and
carried
off
her
bowsprit
this
obstinate
frolic
would
have
cost
those
aboard
the
sloop
very
dear
if
our
steersman
had
not
been
too
generous
to
exert
his
superiority
the
certain
consequence
of
which
would
have
been
the
immediate
sinking
of
the
other
this
contention
of
the
inferior
with
a
might
capable
of
crushing
it
in
an
instant
may
seem
to
argue
no
small
share
of
folly
or
madness
as
well
as
of
impudence
but
i
am
convinced
there
is
very
little
danger
in
it
contempt
is
a
port
to
which
the
pride
of
man
submits
to
fly
with
reluctance
but
those
who
are
within
it
are
always
in
a
place
of
the
most
assured
security
for
whosoever
throws
away
his
sword
prefers
indeed
a
less
honorable
but
much
safer
means
of
avoiding
danger
than
he
who
defends
himself
with
it
and
here
we
shall
offer
another
distinction
of
the
truth
of
which
much
reading
and
experience
have
well
convinced
us
that
as
in
the
most
absolute
governments
there
is
a
regular
progression
of
slavery
downwards
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
the
mischief
of
which
is
seldom
felt
with
any
great
force
and
bitterness
but
by
the
next
immediate
degree
so
in
the
most
dissolute
and
anarchical
states
there
is
as
regular
an
ascent
of
what
is
called
rank
or
condition
which
is
always
laying
hold
of
the
head
of
him
who
is
advanced
but
one
step
higher
on
the
ladder
who
might
if
he
did
not
too
much
despise
such
efforts
kick
his
pursuer
headlong
to
the
bottom
we
will
conclude
this
digression
with
one
general
and
short
observation
which
will
perhaps
set
the
whole
matter
in
a
clearer
light
than
the
longest
and
most
labored
harangue
whereas
envy
of
all
things
most
exposes
us
to
danger
from
others
so
contempt
of
all
things
best
secures
us
from
them
and
thus
while
the
and
the
sloop
are
always
meditating
mischief
against
the
coach
and
the
ship
and
throwing
themselves
designedly
in
their
way
the
latter
consider
only
their
own
security
and
are
not
ashamed
to
break
the
road
and
let
the
other
pass
by
them
monday
july
having
passed
our
sunday
without
anything
remarkable
unless
the
catching
a
great
number
of
whitings
in
the
afternoon
may
be
thought
so
we
now
set
sail
on
monday
at
six
with
a
little
variation
of
wind
but
this
was
so
very
little
and
the
breeze
itself
so
small
but
the
tide
was
our
best
and
indeed
almost
our
only
friend
this
conducted
us
along
the
short
remainder
of
the
kentish
shore
here
we
passed
that
cliff
of
dover
which
makes
so
tremendous
a
figure
in
shakespeare
and
which
whoever
reads
without
being
giddy
must
according
to
addison
observation
have
either
a
very
good
head
or
a
very
bad
one
but
which
whoever
contracts
any
such
ideas
from
the
sight
of
must
have
at
least
a
poetic
if
not
a
shakesperian
genius
in
truth
mountains
rivers
heroes
and
gods
owe
great
part
of
their
existence
to
the
poets
and
greece
and
italy
do
so
plentifully
abound
in
the
former
because
they
furnish
so
glorious
a
number
of
the
latter
who
while
they
bestowed
immortality
on
every
little
hillock
and
blind
stream
left
the
noblest
rivers
and
mountains
in
the
world
to
share
the
same
obscurity
with
the
eastern
and
western
poets
in
which
they
are
celebrated
this
evening
we
beat
the
sea
of
sussex
in
sight
of
dungeness
with
much
more
pleasure
than
progress
for
the
weather
was
almost
a
perfect
calm
and
the
moon
which
was
almost
at
the
full
scarce
suffered
a
single
cloud
to
veil
her
from
our
sight
tuesday
wednesday
july
these
two
days
we
had
much
the
same
fine
weather
and
made
much
the
same
way
but
in
the
evening
of
the
latter
day
a
pretty
fresh
gale
sprung
up
at
which
brought
us
by
the
morning
in
sight
of
the
isle
of
wight
thursday
july
this
gale
continued
till
towards
noon
when
the
east
end
of
the
island
bore
but
little
ahead
of
us
the
captain
swaggered
and
declared
he
would
keep
the
sea
but
the
wind
got
the
better
of
him
so
that
about
three
he
gave
up
the
victory
and
making
a
sudden
tack
stood
in
for
the
shore
passed
by
spithead
and
portsmouth
and
came
to
an
anchor
at
a
place
called
ryde
on
the
island
a
most
tragical
incident
fell
out
this
day
at
sea
while
the
ship
was
under
sail
but
making
as
will
appear
no
great
way
a
kitten
one
of
four
of
the
feline
inhabitants
of
the
cabin
fell
from
the
window
into
the
water
an
alarm
was
immediately
given
to
the
captain
who
was
then
upon
deck
and
received
it
with
the
utmost
concern
and
many
bitter
oaths
he
immediately
gave
orders
to
the
steersman
in
favor
of
the
poor
thing
as
he
called
it
the
sails
were
instantly
slackened
and
all
hands
as
the
phrase
is
employed
to
recover
the
poor
animal
i
was
i
own
extremely
surprised
at
all
this
less
indeed
at
the
extreme
tenderness
than
at
his
conceiving
any
possibility
of
success
for
if
puss
had
had
nine
thousand
instead
of
nine
lives
i
concluded
they
had
been
all
lost
the
boatswain
however
had
more
sanguine
hopes
for
having
stripped
himself
of
his
jacket
breeches
and
shirt
he
leaped
boldly
into
the
water
and
to
my
great
astonishment
in
a
few
minutes
returned
to
the
ship
bearing
the
motionless
animal
in
his
mouth
nor
was
this
i
observed
a
matter
of
such
great
difficulty
as
it
appeared
to
my
ignorance
and
possibly
may
seem
to
that
of
my
reader
the
kitten
was
now
exposed
to
air
and
sun
on
the
deck
where
its
life
of
which
it
retained
no
symptoms
was
despaired
of
by
all
the
captain
humanity
if
i
may
so
call
it
did
not
so
totally
destroy
his
philosophy
as
to
make
him
yield
himself
up
to
affliction
on
this
melancholy
occasion
having
felt
his
loss
like
a
man
he
resolved
to
show
he
could
bear
it
like
one
and
having
declared
he
had
rather
have
lost
a
cask
of
rum
or
brandy
betook
himself
to
threshing
at
backgammon
with
the
portuguese
friar
in
which
innocent
amusement
they
had
passed
about
of
their
time
but
as
i
have
perhaps
a
little
too
wantonly
endeavored
to
raise
the
tender
passions
of
my
readers
in
this
narrative
i
should
think
myself
unpardonable
if
i
concluded
it
without
giving
them
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
that
the
kitten
at
last
recovered
to
the
great
joy
of
the
good
captain
but
to
the
great
disappointment
of
some
of
the
sailors
who
asserted
that
the
drowning
a
cat
was
the
very
surest
way
of
raising
a
favorable
wind
a
supposition
of
which
though
we
have
heard
several
plausible
accounts
we
will
not
presume
to
assign
the
true
original
reason
friday
july
this
day
our
ladies
went
ashore
at
ryde
and
drank
their
afternoon
tea
at
an
there
with
great
satisfaction
here
they
were
regaled
with
fresh
cream
to
which
they
had
been
strangers
since
they
left
the
downs
saturday
july
the
wind
seeming
likely
to
continue
in
the
same
corner
where
it
had
been
almost
constantly
for
two
months
together
i
was
persuaded
by
my
wife
to
go
ashore
and
stay
at
ryde
till
we
sailed
i
approved
the
motion
much
for
though
i
am
a
great
lover
of
the
sea
i
now
fancied
there
was
more
pleasure
in
breathing
the
fresh
air
of
the
land
but
how
to
get
thither
was
the
question
for
being
really
that
dead
luggage
which
i
considered
all
passengers
to
be
in
the
beginning
of
this
narrative
and
incapable
of
any
bodily
motion
without
external
impulse
it
was
in
vain
to
leave
the
ship
or
to
determine
to
do
it
without
the
assistance
of
others
in
one
instance
perhaps
the
living
luggage
is
more
difficult
to
be
moved
or
removed
than
an
equal
or
much
superior
weight
of
dead
matter
which
if
of
the
brittle
kind
may
indeed
be
liable
to
be
broken
through
negligence
but
this
by
proper
care
may
be
almost
certainly
prevented
whereas
the
fractures
to
which
the
living
lumps
are
exposed
are
sometimes
by
no
caution
avoidable
and
often
by
no
art
to
be
amended
i
was
deliberating
on
the
means
of
conveyance
not
so
much
out
of
the
ship
to
the
boat
as
out
of
a
little
tottering
boat
to
the
land
a
matter
which
as
i
had
already
experienced
in
the
thames
was
not
extremely
easy
when
to
be
performed
by
any
other
limbs
than
your
own
whilst
i
weighed
all
that
could
suggest
itself
on
this
head
without
strictly
examining
the
merit
of
the
several
schemes
which
were
advanced
by
the
captain
and
sailors
and
indeed
giving
no
very
deep
attention
even
to
my
wife
who
as
well
as
her
friend
and
my
daughter
were
exerting
their
tender
concern
for
my
ease
and
safety
fortune
for
i
am
convinced
she
had
a
hand
in
it
sent
me
a
present
of
a
buck
a
present
welcome
enough
of
itself
but
more
welcome
on
account
of
the
vessel
in
which
it
came
being
a
large
hoy
which
in
some
places
would
pass
for
a
ship
and
many
people
would
go
some
miles
to
see
the
sight
i
was
pretty
easily
conveyed
on
board
this
hoy
but
to
get
from
hence
to
the
shore
was
not
so
easy
a
task
for
however
strange
it
may
appear
the
water
itself
did
not
extend
so
far
an
instance
which
seems
to
explain
those
lines
of
ovid
omnia
pontus
erant
deerant
quoque
littora
ponto
in
a
less
tautological
sense
than
hath
generally
been
imputed
to
them
in
fact
between
the
sea
and
the
shore
there
was
at
low
water
an
impassable
gulf
if
i
may
so
call
it
of
deep
mud
which
could
neither
be
traversed
by
walking
nor
swimming
so
that
for
near
one
half
of
the
hours
ryde
was
inaccessible
by
friend
or
foe
but
as
the
magistrates
of
this
place
seemed
more
to
desire
the
company
of
the
former
than
to
fear
that
of
the
latter
they
had
begun
to
make
a
small
causeway
to
the
mark
so
that
foot
passengers
might
land
whenever
they
pleased
but
as
this
work
was
of
a
public
kind
and
would
have
cost
a
large
sum
of
money
at
least
ten
pounds
and
the
magistrates
that
is
to
say
the
churchwardens
the
overseers
constable
and
tithingman
and
the
principal
inhabitants
had
every
one
of
them
some
separate
scheme
of
private
interest
to
advance
at
the
expense
of
the
public
they
fell
out
among
themselves
and
after
having
thrown
away
one
half
of
the
requisite
sum
resolved
at
least
to
save
the
other
half
and
rather
be
contented
to
sit
down
losers
themselves
than
to
enjoy
any
benefit
which
might
bring
in
a
greater
profit
to
another
thus
that
unanimity
which
is
so
necessary
in
all
public
affairs
became
wanting
and
every
man
from
the
fear
of
being
a
bubble
to
another
was
in
reality
a
bubble
to
himself
however
as
there
is
scarce
any
difficulty
to
which
the
strength
of
men
assisted
with
the
cunning
of
art
is
not
equal
i
was
at
last
hoisted
into
a
small
boat
and
being
rowed
pretty
near
the
shore
was
taken
up
by
two
sailors
who
waded
with
me
through
the
mud
and
placed
me
in
a
chair
on
the
land
whence
they
afterwards
conveyed
me
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
and
brought
me
to
a
house
which
seemed
to
bid
the
fairest
for
hospitality
of
any
in
ryde
we
brought
with
us
our
provisions
from
the
ship
so
that
we
wanted
nothing
but
a
fire
to
dress
our
dinner
and
a
room
in
which
we
might
eat
it
in
neither
of
these
had
we
any
reason
to
apprehend
a
disappointment
our
dinner
consisting
only
of
beans
and
bacon
and
the
worst
apartment
in
his
majesty
dominions
either
at
home
or
abroad
being
fully
sufficient
to
answer
our
present
ideas
of
delicacy
unluckily
however
we
were
disappointed
in
both
for
when
we
arrived
about
four
at
our
inn
exulting
in
the
hopes
of
immediately
seeing
our
beans
smoking
on
the
table
we
had
the
mortification
of
seeing
them
on
the
table
indeed
but
without
that
circumstance
which
would
have
made
the
sight
agreeable
being
in
the
same
state
in
which
we
had
dispatched
them
from
our
ship
in
excuse
for
this
delay
though
we
had
exceeded
almost
purposely
the
time
appointed
and
our
provision
had
arrived
three
hours
before
the
mistress
of
the
house
acquainted
us
that
it
was
not
for
want
of
time
to
dress
them
that
they
were
not
ready
but
for
fear
of
their
being
cold
or
before
we
should
come
which
she
assured
us
was
much
worse
than
waiting
a
few
minutes
for
our
dinner
an
observation
so
very
just
that
it
is
impossible
to
find
any
objection
in
it
but
indeed
it
was
not
altogether
so
proper
at
this
time
for
we
had
given
the
most
absolute
orders
to
have
them
ready
at
four
and
had
been
ourselves
not
without
much
care
and
difficulty
most
exactly
punctual
in
keeping
to
the
very
minute
of
our
appointment
but
tradesmen
and
servants
never
care
to
indulge
us
in
matters
contrary
to
our
true
interest
which
they
always
know
better
than
ourselves
nor
can
any
bribes
corrupt
them
to
go
out
of
their
way
while
they
are
consulting
our
good
in
our
own
despite
our
disappointment
in
the
other
particular
in
defiance
of
our
humility
as
it
was
more
extraordinary
was
more
provoking
in
short
francis
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
good
woman
of
the
house
no
sooner
received
the
news
of
our
intended
arrival
than
she
considered
more
the
gentility
than
the
humanity
of
her
guests
and
applied
herself
not
to
that
which
kindles
but
to
that
which
extinguishes
fire
and
forgetting
to
put
on
her
pot
fell
to
washing
her
house
as
the
messenger
who
had
brought
my
venison
was
impatient
to
be
dispatched
i
ordered
it
to
be
brought
and
laid
on
the
table
in
the
room
where
i
was
seated
and
the
table
not
being
large
enough
one
side
and
that
a
very
bloody
one
was
laid
on
the
brick
floor
i
then
ordered
francis
to
be
called
in
in
order
to
give
her
instructions
concerning
it
in
particular
what
i
would
have
roasted
and
what
baked
concluding
that
she
would
be
highly
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
so
much
money
being
spent
in
her
house
as
she
might
have
now
reason
to
expect
if
the
wind
continued
only
a
few
days
longer
to
blow
from
the
same
points
whence
it
had
blown
for
several
weeks
past
i
soon
saw
good
cause
i
must
confess
to
despise
my
own
sagacity
francis
having
received
her
orders
without
making
any
answer
snatched
the
side
from
the
floor
which
remained
stained
with
blood
and
bidding
a
servant
to
take
up
that
on
the
table
left
the
room
with
no
pleasant
countenance
muttering
to
herself
that
had
she
known
the
litter
which
was
to
have
been
made
she
would
not
have
taken
such
pains
to
wash
her
house
that
morning
if
this
was
gentility
much
good
may
it
do
such
gentlefolks
for
her
part
she
had
no
notion
of
it
from
these
murmurs
i
received
two
hints
the
one
that
it
was
not
from
a
mistake
of
our
inclination
that
the
good
woman
had
starved
us
but
from
wisely
consulting
her
own
dignity
or
rather
perhaps
her
vanity
to
which
our
hunger
was
offered
up
as
a
sacrifice
the
other
that
i
was
now
sitting
in
a
damp
room
a
circumstance
though
it
had
hitherto
escaped
my
notice
from
the
color
of
the
bricks
which
was
by
no
means
to
be
neglected
in
a
valetudinary
state
my
wife
who
besides
discharging
excellently
well
her
own
and
all
the
tender
offices
becoming
the
female
character
who
besides
being
a
faithful
friend
an
amiable
companion
and
a
tender
nurse
could
likewise
supply
the
wants
of
a
decrepit
husband
and
occasionally
perform
his
part
had
before
this
discovered
the
immoderate
attention
to
neatness
in
francis
and
provided
against
its
ill
consequences
she
had
found
though
not
under
the
same
roof
a
very
snug
apartment
belonging
to
francis
and
which
had
escaped
the
mop
by
his
being
satisfied
it
could
not
possibly
be
visited
by
this
was
a
dry
warm
barn
lined
on
both
sides
with
wheaten
straw
and
opening
at
one
end
into
a
green
field
and
a
beautiful
prospect
here
without
hesitation
she
ordered
the
cloth
to
be
laid
and
came
hastily
to
snatch
me
from
worse
perils
by
water
than
the
common
dangers
of
the
sea
francis
who
could
not
trust
her
own
ears
or
could
not
believe
a
footman
in
so
extraordinary
a
phenomenon
followed
my
wife
and
asked
her
if
she
had
indeed
ordered
the
cloth
to
be
laid
in
the
barn
she
answered
in
the
affirmative
upon
which
francis
declared
she
would
not
dispute
her
pleasure
but
it
was
the
first
time
she
believed
that
quality
had
ever
preferred
a
barn
to
a
house
she
showed
at
the
same
time
the
most
pregnant
marks
of
contempt
and
again
lamented
the
labor
she
had
undergone
through
her
ignorance
of
the
absurd
taste
of
her
guests
at
length
we
were
seated
in
one
of
the
most
pleasant
spots
i
believe
in
the
kingdom
and
were
regaled
with
our
beans
and
bacon
in
which
there
was
nothing
deficient
but
the
quantity
this
defect
was
however
so
deplorable
that
we
had
consumed
our
whole
dish
before
we
had
visibly
lessened
our
hunger
we
now
waited
with
impatience
the
arrival
of
our
second
course
which
necessity
and
not
luxury
had
dictated
this
was
a
joint
of
mutton
which
francis
had
been
ordered
to
provide
but
when
being
tired
with
expectation
we
ordered
our
servants
to
see
for
something
else
we
were
informed
that
there
was
nothing
else
on
which
francis
being
summoned
declared
there
was
no
such
thing
as
mutton
to
be
had
at
ryde
when
i
expressed
some
astonishment
at
their
having
no
butcher
in
a
village
so
situated
she
answered
they
had
a
very
good
one
and
one
that
killed
all
sorts
of
meat
in
season
beef
two
or
three
times
a
year
and
mutton
the
whole
year
round
but
that
it
being
then
beans
and
peas
time
he
killed
no
meat
by
reason
he
was
not
sure
of
selling
it
this
she
had
not
thought
worthy
of
communication
any
more
than
that
there
lived
a
fisherman
at
next
door
who
was
then
provided
with
plenty
of
soles
and
whitings
and
lobsters
far
superior
to
those
which
adorn
a
city
feast
this
discovery
being
made
by
accident
we
completed
the
best
the
pleasantest
and
the
merriest
meal
with
more
appetite
more
real
solid
luxury
and
more
festivity
than
was
ever
seen
in
an
entertainment
at
white
it
may
be
wondered
at
perhaps
that
francis
should
be
so
negligent
of
providing
for
her
guests
as
she
may
seem
to
be
thus
inattentive
to
her
own
interest
but
this
was
not
the
case
for
having
clapped
a
on
our
heads
at
our
arrival
and
determined
at
what
price
to
discharge
our
bodies
from
her
house
the
less
she
suffered
any
other
to
share
in
the
levy
the
clearer
it
came
into
her
own
pocket
and
that
it
was
better
to
get
twelve
pence
in
a
shilling
than
ten
pence
which
latter
would
be
the
case
if
she
afforded
us
fish
at
any
rate
thus
we
passed
a
most
agreeable
day
owing
to
good
appetites
and
good
humor
two
hearty
feeders
which
will
devour
with
satisfaction
whatever
food
you
place
before
them
whereas
without
these
the
elegance
of
james
the
charde
the
or
the
ortolan
the
venison
the
turtle
or
the
custard
may
titillate
the
throat
but
will
never
convey
happiness
to
the
heart
or
cheerfulness
to
the
countenance
as
the
wind
appeared
still
immovable
my
wife
proposed
my
lying
on
shore
i
presently
agreed
though
in
defiance
of
an
act
of
parliament
by
which
persons
wandering
abroad
and
lodging
in
are
decreed
to
be
rogues
and
vagabonds
and
this
too
after
having
been
very
singularly
officious
in
putting
that
law
in
execution
my
wife
having
reconnoitered
the
house
reported
that
there
was
one
room
in
which
were
two
beds
it
was
concluded
therefore
that
she
and
harriot
should
occupy
one
and
myself
take
possession
of
the
other
she
added
likewise
an
ingenious
recommendation
of
this
room
to
one
who
had
so
long
been
in
a
cabin
which
it
exactly
resembled
as
it
was
sunk
down
with
age
on
one
side
and
was
in
the
form
of
a
ship
with
gunwales
too
for
my
own
part
i
make
little
doubt
but
this
apartment
was
an
ancient
temple
built
with
the
materials
of
a
wreck
and
probably
dedicated
to
neptune
in
honor
of
the
blessing
sent
by
him
to
the
inhabitants
such
blessings
having
in
all
ages
been
very
common
to
them
the
timber
employed
in
it
confirms
this
opinion
being
such
as
is
seldom
used
by
ally
but
i
do
not
find
indeed
any
mention
of
this
matter
in
hearn
but
perhaps
its
antiquity
was
too
modern
to
deserve
his
notice
certain
it
is
that
this
island
of
wight
was
not
an
early
convert
to
christianity
nay
there
is
some
reason
to
doubt
whether
it
was
ever
entirely
converted
but
i
have
only
time
to
touch
slightly
on
things
of
this
kind
which
luckily
for
us
we
have
a
society
whose
peculiar
profession
it
is
to
discuss
and
develop
sunday
july
this
morning
early
i
summoned
francis
in
order
to
pay
her
the
preceding
day
account
as
i
could
recollect
only
two
or
three
articles
i
thought
there
was
no
necessity
of
pen
and
ink
in
a
single
instance
only
we
had
exceeded
what
the
law
allows
gratis
to
a
on
his
march
vinegar
salt
and
dressing
his
meat
i
found
however
i
was
mistaken
in
my
calculation
for
when
the
good
woman
attended
with
her
bill
it
contained
as
follows
bread
and
beer
wind
rum
dressing
dinner
tea
firing
lodging
servants
lodging
l
now
that
five
people
and
two
servants
should
live
a
day
and
night
at
a
for
so
small
a
sum
will
appear
incredible
to
any
person
in
london
above
the
degree
of
a
but
more
astonishing
will
it
seem
that
these
people
should
remain
so
long
at
such
a
house
without
tasting
any
other
delicacy
than
bread
small
beer
a
teacupful
of
milk
called
cream
a
glass
of
rum
converted
into
punch
by
their
own
materials
and
one
bottle
of
wind
of
which
we
only
tasted
a
single
glass
though
possibly
indeed
our
servants
drank
the
remainder
of
the
bottle
this
wind
is
a
liquor
of
english
manufacture
and
its
flavor
is
thought
very
delicious
by
the
generality
of
the
english
who
drink
it
in
great
quantities
every
seventh
year
is
thought
to
produce
as
much
as
the
other
six
it
is
then
drank
so
plentifully
that
the
whole
nation
are
in
a
manner
intoxicated
by
it
and
consequently
very
little
business
is
carried
on
at
that
season
it
resembles
in
color
the
red
wine
which
is
imported
from
portugal
as
it
doth
in
its
intoxicating
quality
hence
and
from
this
agreement
in
the
orthography
the
one
is
often
confounded
with
the
other
though
both
are
seldom
esteemed
by
the
same
person
it
is
to
be
had
in
every
parish
of
the
kingdom
and
a
pretty
large
quantity
is
consumed
in
the
metropolis
where
several
taverns
are
set
apart
solely
for
the
vendition
of
this
liquor
the
masters
never
dealing
in
any
other
the
disagreement
in
our
computation
produced
some
small
remonstrance
to
francis
on
my
side
but
this
received
an
immediate
answer
she
scorned
to
overcharge
gentlemen
her
house
had
been
always
frequented
by
the
very
best
gentry
of
the
island
and
she
had
never
had
a
bill
found
fault
with
in
her
life
though
she
had
lived
upwards
of
forty
years
in
the
house
and
within
that
time
the
greatest
gentry
in
hampshire
had
been
at
it
and
that
lawyer
willis
never
went
to
any
other
when
he
came
to
those
parts
that
for
her
part
she
did
not
get
her
livelihood
by
travelers
who
were
gone
and
away
and
she
never
expected
to
see
them
more
but
that
her
neighbors
might
come
again
wherefore
to
be
sure
they
had
the
only
right
to
complain
she
was
proceeding
thus
and
from
her
volubility
of
tongue
seemed
likely
to
stretch
the
discourse
to
an
immoderate
length
when
i
suddenly
cut
all
short
by
paying
the
bill
this
morning
our
ladies
went
to
church
more
i
fear
from
curiosity
than
religion
they
were
attended
by
the
captain
in
a
most
military
attire
with
his
cockade
in
his
hat
and
his
sword
by
his
side
so
unusual
an
appearance
in
this
little
chapel
drew
the
attention
of
all
present
and
probably
disconcerted
the
women
who
were
in
dishabille
and
wished
themselves
dressed
for
the
sake
of
the
curate
who
was
the
greatest
of
their
beholders
while
i
was
left
alone
i
received
a
visit
from
francis
himself
who
was
much
more
considerable
as
a
farmer
than
as
an
indeed
he
left
the
latter
entirely
to
the
care
of
his
wife
and
he
acted
wisely
i
believe
in
so
doing
as
nothing
more
remarkable
passed
on
this
day
i
will
close
it
with
the
account
of
these
two
characters
as
far
as
a
few
days
residence
could
inform
me
of
them
if
they
should
appear
as
new
to
the
reader
as
they
did
to
me
he
will
not
be
displeased
at
finding
them
here
this
amiable
couple
seemed
to
border
hard
on
their
grand
climacteric
nor
indeed
were
they
shy
of
owning
enough
to
fix
their
ages
within
a
year
or
two
of
that
time
they
appeared
to
be
rather
proud
of
having
employed
their
time
well
than
ashamed
of
having
lived
so
long
the
only
reason
which
i
could
ever
assign
why
some
fine
ladies
and
fine
gentlemen
too
should
desire
to
be
thought
younger
than
they
really
are
by
the
contemporaries
of
their
grandchildren
some
indeed
who
too
hastily
credit
appearances
might
doubt
whether
they
had
made
so
good
a
use
of
their
time
as
i
would
insinuate
since
there
was
no
appearance
of
anything
but
poverty
want
and
wretchedness
about
their
house
nor
could
they
produce
anything
to
a
customer
in
exchange
for
his
money
but
a
few
bottles
of
wind
and
spirituous
liquors
and
some
very
bad
ale
to
drink
with
rusty
bacon
and
worse
cheese
to
eat
but
then
it
should
be
considered
on
the
other
side
that
whatever
they
received
was
almost
as
entirely
clear
profit
as
the
blessing
of
a
wreck
itself
such
an
inn
being
the
very
reverse
of
a
for
here
you
can
neither
sit
for
nothing
nor
have
anything
for
your
money
again
as
many
marks
of
want
abounded
everywhere
so
were
the
marks
of
antiquity
visible
scarce
anything
was
to
be
seen
which
had
not
some
scar
upon
it
made
by
the
hand
of
time
not
an
utensil
it
was
manifest
had
been
purchased
within
a
dozen
years
last
past
so
that
whatever
money
had
come
into
the
house
during
that
period
at
least
must
have
remained
in
it
unless
it
had
been
sent
abroad
for
food
or
other
perishable
commodities
but
these
were
supplied
by
a
small
portion
of
the
fruits
of
the
farm
in
which
the
farmer
allowed
he
had
a
very
good
bargain
in
fact
it
is
inconceivable
what
sums
may
be
collected
by
starving
only
and
how
easy
it
is
for
a
man
to
die
rich
if
he
will
but
be
contented
to
live
miserable
nor
is
there
in
this
kind
of
starving
anything
so
terrible
as
some
apprehend
it
neither
wastes
a
man
flesh
nor
robs
him
of
his
cheerfulness
the
famous
cornaro
case
well
proves
the
contrary
and
so
did
farmer
francis
who
was
of
a
round
stature
had
a
plump
round
face
with
a
kind
of
smile
on
it
and
seemed
to
borrow
an
air
of
wretchedness
rather
from
his
coat
age
than
from
his
own
the
truth
is
there
is
a
certain
diet
which
emaciates
men
more
than
any
possible
degree
of
abstinence
though
i
do
not
remember
to
have
seen
any
caution
against
it
either
in
cheney
arbuthnot
or
in
any
other
modern
writer
or
regimen
nay
the
very
name
is
not
i
believe
in
the
learned
dictionary
all
which
is
the
more
extraordinary
as
it
is
a
very
common
food
in
this
kingdom
and
the
college
themselves
were
not
long
since
very
liberally
entertained
with
it
by
the
present
attorney
and
other
eminent
lawyers
in
and
were
all
made
horribly
sick
by
it
but
though
it
should
not
be
found
among
our
english
physical
writers
we
may
be
assured
of
meeting
with
it
among
the
greeks
for
nothing
considerable
in
nature
escapes
their
notice
though
many
things
considerable
in
them
it
is
to
be
feared
have
escaped
the
notice
of
their
readers
the
greeks
then
to
all
such
as
feed
too
voraciously
on
this
diet
give
the
name
of
heautofagi
which
our
physicians
will
i
suppose
translate
men
that
eat
themselves
as
nothing
is
so
destructive
to
the
body
as
this
kind
of
food
so
nothing
is
so
plentiful
and
cheap
but
it
was
perhaps
the
only
cheap
thing
the
farmer
disliked
probably
living
much
on
fish
might
produce
this
disgust
for
diodorus
siculus
attributes
the
same
aversion
in
a
people
of
ethiopia
to
the
same
cause
he
calls
them
the
and
asserts
that
they
can
not
be
brought
to
eat
a
single
meal
with
the
heautofagi
by
any
persuasion
threat
or
violence
whatever
not
even
though
they
should
kill
their
children
before
their
faces
what
hath
puzzled
our
physicians
and
prevented
them
from
setting
this
matter
in
the
clearest
light
is
possibly
one
simple
mistake
arising
from
a
very
excusable
ignorance
that
the
passions
of
men
are
capable
of
swallowing
food
as
well
as
their
appetites
that
the
former
in
feeding
resemble
the
state
of
those
animals
who
chew
the
cud
and
therefore
such
men
in
some
sense
may
be
said
to
prey
on
themselves
and
as
it
were
to
devour
their
own
entrails
and
hence
ensues
a
meager
aspect
and
thin
habit
of
body
as
surely
as
from
what
is
called
a
consumption
our
farmer
was
one
of
these
he
had
no
more
passion
than
an
ichthuofagus
or
ethiopian
fisher
he
wished
not
for
anything
thought
not
of
anything
indeed
he
scarce
did
anything
or
said
anything
here
i
can
not
be
understood
strictly
for
then
i
must
describe
a
nonentity
whereas
i
would
rob
him
of
nothing
but
that
free
agency
which
is
the
cause
of
all
the
corruption
and
of
all
the
misery
of
human
nature
no
man
indeed
ever
did
more
than
the
farmer
for
he
was
an
absolute
slave
to
labor
all
the
week
but
in
truth
as
my
sagacious
reader
must
have
at
first
apprehended
when
i
said
he
resigned
the
care
of
the
house
to
his
wife
i
meant
more
than
i
then
expressed
even
the
house
and
all
that
belonged
to
it
for
he
was
really
a
farmer
only
under
the
direction
of
his
wife
in
a
word
so
composed
so
serene
so
placid
a
countenance
i
never
saw
and
he
satisfied
himself
by
answering
to
every
question
he
was
asked
i
do
know
anything
about
it
sir
i
leaves
all
that
to
my
wife
now
as
a
couple
of
this
kind
would
like
two
vessels
of
oil
have
made
no
composition
in
life
and
for
want
of
all
savor
must
have
palled
every
taste
nature
or
fortune
or
both
of
them
took
care
to
provide
a
proper
quantity
of
acid
in
the
materials
that
formed
the
wife
and
to
render
her
a
perfect
helpmate
for
so
tranquil
a
husband
she
abounded
in
whatsoever
he
was
defective
that
is
to
say
in
almost
everything
she
was
indeed
as
vinegar
to
oil
or
a
brisk
wind
to
a
and
preserved
all
from
stagnation
and
corruption
quin
the
player
on
taking
a
nice
and
severe
survey
of
a
burst
forth
into
this
exclamation
if
that
fellow
be
not
a
rogue
god
almighty
doth
not
write
a
legible
hand
whether
he
guessed
right
or
no
is
not
worth
my
while
to
examine
certain
it
is
that
the
latter
having
wrought
his
features
into
a
proper
harmony
to
become
the
characters
of
iago
shylock
and
others
of
the
same
cast
gave
us
a
semblance
of
truth
to
the
observation
that
was
sufficient
to
confirm
the
wit
of
it
indeed
we
may
remark
in
favor
of
the
physiognomist
though
the
law
has
made
him
a
rogue
and
vagabond
that
nature
is
seldom
curious
in
her
works
within
without
employing
some
little
pains
on
the
outside
and
this
more
particularly
in
mischievous
characters
in
forming
which
as
derham
observes
in
venomous
insects
as
the
sting
or
saw
of
a
wasp
she
is
sometimes
wonderfully
industrious
now
when
she
hath
thus
completely
armed
our
hero
to
carry
on
a
war
with
man
she
never
fails
of
furnishing
that
innocent
lambkin
with
some
means
of
knowing
his
enemy
and
foreseeing
his
designs
thus
she
hath
been
observed
to
act
in
the
case
of
a
rattlesnake
which
never
meditates
a
human
prey
without
giving
warning
of
his
approach
this
observation
will
i
am
convinced
hold
most
true
if
applied
to
the
most
venomous
individuals
of
human
insects
a
tyrant
a
trickster
and
a
bully
generally
wear
the
marks
of
their
several
dispositions
in
their
countenances
so
do
the
vixen
the
shrew
the
scold
and
all
other
females
of
the
like
kind
but
perhaps
nature
hath
never
afforded
a
stronger
example
of
all
this
than
in
the
case
of
francis
she
was
a
short
squat
woman
her
head
was
closely
joined
to
her
shoulders
where
it
was
fixed
somewhat
awry
every
feature
of
her
countenance
was
sharp
and
pointed
her
face
was
furrowed
with
the
smallpox
and
her
complexion
which
seemed
to
be
able
to
turn
milk
to
curds
not
a
little
resembled
in
color
such
milk
as
had
already
undergone
that
operation
she
appeared
indeed
to
have
many
symptoms
of
a
deep
jaundice
in
her
look
but
the
strength
and
firmness
of
her
voice
overbalanced
them
all
the
tone
of
this
was
a
sharp
treble
at
a
distance
for
i
seldom
heard
it
on
the
same
floor
but
was
usually
waked
with
it
in
the
morning
and
entertained
with
it
almost
continually
through
the
whole
day
though
vocal
be
usually
put
in
opposition
to
instrumental
music
i
question
whether
this
might
not
be
thought
to
partake
of
the
nature
of
both
for
she
played
on
two
instruments
which
she
seemed
to
keep
for
no
other
use
from
morning
till
night
these
were
two
maids
or
rather
who
i
suppose
by
some
means
or
other
earned
their
board
and
she
gave
them
their
lodging
gratis
or
for
no
other
service
than
to
keep
her
lungs
in
constant
exercise
she
differed
as
i
have
said
in
every
particular
from
her
husband
but
very
remarkably
in
this
that
as
it
was
impossible
to
displease
him
so
it
was
as
impossible
to
please
her
and
as
no
art
could
remove
a
smile
from
his
countenance
so
could
no
art
carry
it
into
hers
if
her
bills
were
remonstrated
against
she
was
offended
with
the
tacit
censure
of
her
if
they
were
not
she
seemed
to
regard
it
as
a
tacit
sarcasm
on
her
folly
which
might
have
set
down
larger
prices
with
the
same
success
on
this
lather
hint
she
did
indeed
improve
for
she
daily
raised
some
of
her
articles
a
pennyworth
of
fire
was
rated
at
a
shilling
at
and
if
she
dressed
us
two
dishes
for
two
shillings
on
the
saturday
we
paid
for
the
cookery
of
one
on
the
sunday
and
whenever
she
was
paid
she
never
left
the
room
without
lamenting
the
small
amount
of
her
bill
saying
she
knew
not
how
it
was
that
others
got
their
money
by
but
for
her
part
she
had
not
the
art
of
it
when
she
was
asked
why
she
complained
when
she
was
paid
all
she
demanded
she
answered
she
could
not
deny
that
nor
did
she
know
she
had
omitted
anything
but
that
it
was
but
a
poor
bill
for
to
pay
i
accounted
for
all
this
by
her
having
heard
that
it
is
a
maxim
with
the
principal
on
the
continent
to
levy
considerable
sums
on
their
guests
who
travel
with
many
horses
and
servants
though
such
guests
should
eat
little
or
nothing
in
their
houses
the
method
being
i
believe
in
such
cases
to
lay
a
capitation
on
the
horses
and
not
on
their
masters
but
she
did
not
consider
that
in
most
of
these
inns
a
very
great
degree
of
hunger
without
any
degree
of
delicacy
may
be
satisfied
and
that
in
all
such
inns
there
is
some
appearance
at
least
of
provision
as
well
as
of
a
to
dress
it

summons

the
case

of

in
that
one
third

part

of
the
levy
imposed
at
inns
was
in
truth
a
higher
tax
than
the
whole
was
when
laid
on
in
the
other

in
order
to
raise
a
small
sum
a
man
is
obliged
to
submit
to

as
many
various
ways

doth

enters

extraordinary

francis
levied
a
tax
of
fourteen
shillings
for
the
sunday
we
regaled
ourselves
at
dinner
with
venison
and
good
claret
of
our
own
and
in
the
afternoon
the
women
attended
by
the
captain
walked
to
see
a
delightful
scene
two
miles
distant
with
the
beauties
of
which
they
declared
themselves
most
highly
charmed
at
their
return
as
well
as
with
the
goodness
of
the
lady
of
the
mansion

had
slipped
out
of

way
that
my
wife

might
refresh
themselves
with

abounded
tuesday
july
this
day
having
paid
our
taxes
of
yesterday
we
were
permitted
to
regale
ourselves
with
more
venison
some
of
this
we
would
willingly
have
exchanged
for
mutton
but
no
such
flesh
was
to
be
had
nearer
than
portsmouth
from
whence
it
would
have
cost
more
to
convey
a
joint
to
us
than
the
freight
of
a
portugal
ham
from
lisbon
to
london
amounts
to
for
though
the
be
somewhat
cheaper
here
than
at
deal
yet
can
you
find
no
waterman
who
will
go
on
board
his
boat
unless
by
two
or
three
hours
rowing
he
can
get
drunk
for
the
residue
of
the
week
and
here
i
have
an
opportunity
which
possibly
may
not
offer
again
of
publishing
some
observations
on
that
political
economy
of
this
nation
which
as
it
concerns
only
the
regulation
of
the
mob
is
below
the
notice
of
our
great
men
though
on
the
due
regulation
of
this
order
depend
many
emoluments
which
the
great
men
themselves
or
at
least
many
who
tread
close
on
their
heels
may
enjoy
as
well
as
some
dangers
which
may
some
time
or
other
arise
from
introducing
a
pure
state
of
anarchy
among
them
i
will
represent
the
case
as
it
appears
to
me
very
fairly
and
impartially
between
the
mob
and
their
betters
the
whole
mischief
which
infects
this
part
of
our
economy
arises
from
the
vague
and
uncertain
use
of
a
word
called
liberty
of
which
as
scarce
any
two
men
with
whom
i
have
ever
conversed
seem
to
have
one
and
the
same
idea
i
am
inclined
to
doubt
whether
there
be
any
simple
universal
notion
represented
by
this
word
or
whether
it
conveys
any
clearer
or
more
determinate
idea
than
some
of
those
old
punic
compositions
of
syllables
preserved
in
one
of
the
comedies
of
plautus
but
at
present
as
i
conceive
not
supposed
to
be
understood
by
any
one
by
liberty
however
i
apprehend
is
commonly
understood
the
power
of
doing
what
we
please
not
absolutely
for
then
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
law
by
whose
control
the
liberty
of
the
freest
people
except
only
the
hottentots
and
wild
indians
must
always
be
restrained
but
indeed
however
largely
we
extend
or
however
moderately
we
confine
the
sense
of
the
word
no
politician
will
i
presume
contend
that
it
is
to
pervade
in
an
equal
degree
and
be
with
the
same
extent
enjoyed
by
every
member
of
society
no
such
polity
having
been
ever
found
unless
among
those
vile
people
just
before
commemorated
among
the
greeks
and
romans
the
servile
and
free
conditions
were
opposed
to
each
other
and
no
man
who
had
the
misfortune
to
be
enrolled
under
the
former
could
lay
any
claim
to
liberty
till
the
right
was
conveyed
to
him
by
that
master
whose
slave
he
was
either
by
the
means
of
conquest
of
purchase
or
of
birth
this
was
the
state
of
all
the
free
nations
in
the
world
and
this
till
very
lately
was
understood
to
be
the
case
of
our
own
i
will
not
indeed
say
this
is
the
case
at
present
the
lowest
class
of
our
people
having
shaken
off
all
the
shackles
of
their
superiors
and
become
not
only
as
free
but
even
freer
than
most
of
their
superiors
i
believe
it
can
not
be
doubted
though
perhaps
we
have
no
recent
instance
of
it
that
the
personal
attendance
of
every
man
who
hath
three
hundred
pounds
per
annum
in
parliament
is
indispensably
his
duty
and
that
if
the
citizens
and
burgesses
of
any
city
or
borough
shall
choose
such
a
one
however
reluctant
he
appear
he
may
be
obliged
to
attend
and
be
forcibly
brought
to
his
duty
by
the
again
there
are
numbers
of
subordinate
offices
some
of
which
are
of
burden
and
others
of
expense
in
the
civil
government
all
of
which
persons
who
are
qualified
are
liable
to
have
imposed
on
them
may
be
obliged
to
undertake
and
properly
execute
notwithstanding
any
bodily
labor
or
even
danger
to
which
they
may
subject
themselves
under
the
penalty
of
fines
and
imprisonment
nay
and
what
may
appear
somewhat
hard
may
be
compelled
to
satisfy
the
losses
which
are
eventually
incident
to
that
of
sheriff
in
particular
out
of
their
own
private
fortunes
and
though
this
should
prove
the
ruin
of
a
family
yet
the
public
to
whom
the
price
is
due
incurs
no
debt
or
obligation
to
preserve
its
officer
harmless
let
his
innocence
appear
ever
so
clearly
i
purposely
omit
the
mention
of
those
military
or
military
duties
which
our
old
constitution
laid
upon
its
greatest
members
these
might
indeed
supply
their
posts
with
some
other
men
but
if
no
such
could
have
been
found
the
obligation
nevertheless
remained
and
they
were
compellable
to
serve
in
their
own
proper
persons
the
only
one
therefore
who
is
possessed
of
absolute
liberty
is
the
lowest
member
of
the
society
who
if
he
prefers
hunger
or
the
wild
product
of
the
fields
hedges
lanes
and
rivers
with
the
indulgence
of
ease
and
laziness
to
a
food
a
little
more
delicate
but
purchased
at
the
expense
of
labor
may
lay
himself
under
a
shade
nor
can
be
forced
to
take
the
other
alternative
from
that
which
he
hath
i
will
not
affirm
whether
wisely
or
foolishly
chosen
here
i
may
perhaps
be
reminded
of
the
last
vagrant
act
where
all
such
persons
are
compellable
to
work
for
the
usual
and
accustomed
wages
allowed
in
the
place
but
this
is
a
clause
little
known
to
the
justices
of
the
peace
and
least
likely
to
be
executed
by
those
who
do
know
it
as
they
know
likewise
that
it
is
formed
on
the
ancient
power
of
the
justices
to
fix
and
settle
these
wages
every
year
making
proper
allowances
for
the
scarcity
and
plenty
of
the
times
the
cheapness
and
dearness
of
the
place
and
that
the
usual
and
accustomed
wages
are
words
without
any
force
or
meaning
when
there
are
no
such
but
every
man
spunges
and
raps
whatever
he
can
get
and
will
haggle
as
long
and
struggle
as
hard
to
cheat
his
employer
of
twopence
in
a
day
labor
as
an
honest
tradesman
will
to
cheat
his
customers
of
the
same
sum
in
a
yard
of
cloth
or
silk
it
is
a
great
pity
then
that
this
power
or
rather
this
practice
was
not
revived
but
this
having
been
so
long
omitted
that
it
is
become
obsolete
will
be
best
done
by
a
new
law
in
which
this
power
as
well
as
the
consequent
power
of
forcing
the
poor
to
labor
at
a
moderate
and
reasonable
rate
should
be
well
considered
and
their
execution
facilitated
for
gentlemen
who
give
their
time
and
labor
gratis
and
even
voluntarily
to
the
public
have
a
right
to
expect
that
all
their
business
be
made
as
easy
as
possible
and
to
enact
laws
without
doing
this
is
to
fill
our
much
too
full
already
still
fuller
with
dead
letter
of
no
use
but
to
the
printer
of
the
acts
of
parliament
that
the
evil
which
i
have
here
pointed
at
is
of
itself
worth
redressing
is
i
apprehend
no
subject
of
dispute
for
why
should
any
persons
in
distress
be
deprived
of
the
assistance
of
their
when
they
are
willing
amply
to
reward
them
for
their
labor
or
why
should
the
lowest
of
the
people
be
permitted
to
exact
ten
times
the
value
of
their
work
for
those
exactions
increase
with
the
degrees
of
necessity
in
their
object
insomuch
that
on
the
former
side
many
are
horribly
imposed
upon
and
that
often
in
no
trifling
matters
i
was
very
well
assured
that
at
deal
no
less
than
ten
guineas
was
required
and
paid
by
the
supercargo
of
an
indiaman
for
carrying
him
on
board
two
miles
from
the
shore
when
she
was
just
ready
to
sail
so
that
his
necessity
as
his
pillager
well
understood
was
absolute
again
many
others
whose
indignation
will
not
submit
to
such
plunder
are
forced
to
refuse
the
assistance
though
they
are
often
great
sufferers
by
so
doing
on
the
latter
side
the
lowest
of
the
people
are
encouraged
in
laziness
and
idleness
while
they
live
by
a
twentieth
part
of
the
labor
that
ought
to
maintain
them
which
is
diametrically
opposite
to
the
interest
of
the
public
for
that
requires
a
great
deal
to
be
done
not
to
be
paid
for
a
little
and
moreover
they
are
confirmed
in
habits
of
exaction
and
are
taught
to
consider
the
distresses
of
their
superiors
as
their
own
fair
emolument
but
enough
of
this
matter
of
which
i
at
first
intended
only
to
convey
a
hint
to
those
who
are
alone
capable
of
applying
the
remedy
though
they
are
the
last
to
whom
the
notice
of
those
evils
would
occur
without
some
such
monitor
as
myself
who
am
forced
to
travel
about
the
world
in
the
form
of
a
passenger
i
can
not
but
say
i
heartily
wish
our
governors
would
attentively
consider
this
method
of
fixing
the
price
of
labor
and
by
that
means
of
compelling
the
poor
to
work
since
the
due
execution
of
such
powers
will
i
apprehend
be
found
the
true
and
only
means
of
making
them
useful
and
of
advancing
trade
from
its
present
visibly
declining
state
to
the
height
to
which
sir
william
petty
in
his
political
arithmetic
thinks
it
capable
of
being
carried
in
the
afternoon
the
lady
of
the
mansion
called
at
our
inn
and
left
her
compliments
to
us
with
francis
with
an
assurance
that
while
we
continued
in
that
place
where
she
feared
we
could
be
but
indifferently
accommodated
we
were
extremely
welcome
to
the
use
of
anything
which
her
garden
or
her
house
afforded
so
polite
a
message
convinced
us
in
spite
of
some
arguments
to
the
contrary
that
we
were
not
on
the
coast
of
africa
or
on
some
island
where
the
few
savage
inhabitants
have
little
of
human
in
them
besides
their
form
and
here
i
mean
nothing
less
than
to
derogate
from
the
merit
of
this
lady
who
is
not
only
extremely
polite
in
her
behavior
to
strangers
of
her
own
rank
but
so
extremely
good
and
charitable
to
all
her
poor
neighbors
who
stand
in
need
of
her
assistance
that
she
hath
the
universal
love
and
praises
of
all
who
live
near
her
but
in
reality
how
little
doth
the
acquisition
of
so
valuable
a
character
and
the
full
indulgence
of
so
worthy
a
disposition
cost
those
who
possess
it
both
are
accomplished
by
the
very
offals
which
fall
from
a
table
moderately
plentiful
that
they
are
enjoyed
therefore
by
so
few
arises
truly
from
there
being
so
few
who
have
any
such
disposition
to
gratify
or
who
aim
at
any
such
character
wednesday
july
this
morning
after
having
been
mulcted
as
usual
we
dispatched
a
servant
with
proper
acknowledgments
of
the
goodness
but
confined
our
wants
entirely
to
the
productions
of
her
garden
he
soon
returned
in
company
with
the
gardener
both
richly
laden
with
almost
every
particular
which
a
garden
at
this
most
fruitful
season
of
the
year
produces
while
we
were
regaling
ourselves
with
these
towards
the
close
of
our
dinner
we
received
orders
from
our
commander
who
had
dined
that
day
with
some
inferior
officers
on
board
a
to
return
instantly
to
the
ship
for
that
the
wind
was
become
favorable
and
he
should
weigh
that
evening
these
orders
were
soon
followed
by
the
captain
himself
who
was
still
in
the
utmost
hurry
though
the
occasion
of
it
had
long
since
ceased
for
the
wind
had
indeed
a
little
shifted
that
afternoon
but
was
before
this
very
quietly
set
down
in
its
old
quarters
this
last
was
a
lucky
hit
for
me
for
as
the
captain
to
whose
orders
we
resolved
to
pay
no
obedience
unless
delivered
by
himself
did
not
return
till
past
six
so
much
time
seemed
requisite
to
put
up
the
furniture
of
our
or
for
almost
every
article
even
to
some
of
the
chairs
were
either
our
own
or
the
property
so
much
more
in
conveying
it
as
well
as
myself
as
dead
a
luggage
as
any
to
the
shore
and
thence
to
the
ship
that
the
night
threatened
first
to
overtake
us
a
terrible
circumstance
to
me
in
my
decayed
condition
especially
as
very
heavy
showers
of
rain
attended
with
a
high
wind
continued
to
fall
incessantly
the
being
carried
through
which
two
miles
in
the
dark
in
a
wet
and
open
boat
seemed
little
less
than
certain
death
however
as
my
commander
was
absolute
his
orders
peremptory
and
my
obedience
necessary
i
resolved
to
avail
myself
of
a
philosophy
which
hath
been
of
notable
use
to
me
in
the
latter
part
of
my
life
and
which
is
contained
in
this
hemistich
of
virgil
superanda
omnis
fortuna
ferendo
est
the
meaning
of
which
if
virgil
had
any
i
think
i
rightly
understood
and
rightly
applied
as
i
was
therefore
to
be
entirely
passive
in
my
motion
i
resolved
to
abandon
myself
to
the
conduct
of
those
who
were
to
carry
me
into
a
cart
when
it
returned
from
unloading
the
goods
but
before
this
the
captain
perceiving
what
had
happened
in
the
clouds
and
that
the
wind
remained
as
much
his
enemy
as
ever
came
upstairs
to
me
with
a
reprieve
till
the
morning
this
was
i
own
very
agreeable
news
and
i
little
regretted
the
trouble
of
refurnishing
my
apartment
by
sending
back
for
the
goods
francis
was
not
well
pleased
with
this
as
she
understood
the
reprieve
to
be
only
till
the
morning
she
saw
nothing
but
lodging
to
be
possibly
added
out
of
which
she
was
to
deduct
fire
and
candle
and
the
remainder
she
thought
would
scarce
pay
her
for
her
trouble
she
exerted
therefore
all
the
of
which
she
was
mistress
and
did
all
she
could
to
thwart
and
perplex
everything
during
the
whole
evening
thursday
july
early
in
the
morning
the
captain
who
had
remained
on
shore
all
night
came
to
visit
us
and
to
press
us
to
make
haste
on
board
i
am
resolved
says
he
not
to
lose
a
moment
now
the
wind
is
coming
about
fair
for
my
own
part
i
never
was
surer
of
a
wind
in
all
my
life
i
use
his
very
words
nor
will
i
presume
to
interpret
or
comment
upon
them
farther
than
by
observing
that
they
were
spoke
in
the
utmost
hurry
we
promised
to
be
ready
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
but
this
was
not
so
soon
as
was
expected
for
in
removing
our
goods
the
evening
before
the
was
unhappily
lost
every
place
was
immediately
searched
and
many
where
it
was
impossible
for
it
to
be
for
this
was
a
loss
of
much
greater
consequence
than
it
may
at
first
seem
to
many
of
my
readers
ladies
and
valetudinarians
do
not
easily
dispense
with
the
use
of
this
sovereign
cordial
in
a
single
instance
but
to
undertake
a
long
voyage
without
any
probability
of
being
supplied
with
it
the
whole
way
was
above
the
reach
of
patience
and
yet
dreadful
as
this
calamity
was
it
seemed
unavoidable
the
whole
town
of
ryde
could
not
supply
a
single
leaf
for
as
to
what
francis
and
the
shop
called
by
that
name
it
was
not
of
chinese
growth
it
did
not
indeed
in
the
least
resemble
tea
either
in
smell
or
taste
or
in
any
particular
unless
in
being
a
leaf
for
it
was
in
truth
no
other
than
a
tobacco
of
the
mundungus
species
and
as
for
the
hopes
of
relief
in
any
other
port
they
were
not
to
be
depended
upon
for
the
captain
had
positively
declared
he
was
sure
of
a
wind
and
would
let
go
his
anchor
no
more
till
he
arrived
in
the
tajo
when
a
good
deal
of
time
had
been
spent
most
of
it
indeed
wasted
on
this
occasion
a
thought
occurred
which
every
one
wondered
at
its
not
having
presented
itself
the
first
moment
this
was
to
apply
to
the
good
lady
who
could
not
fail
of
pitying
and
relieving
such
distress
a
messenger
was
immediately
despatched
with
an
account
of
our
misfortune
till
whose
return
we
employed
ourselves
in
preparatives
for
our
departure
that
we
might
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
swallow
our
breakfast
when
it
arrived
the
though
of
no
less
consequence
to
us
than
the
to
a
general
was
given
up
as
lost
or
rather
as
stolen
for
though
i
would
not
for
the
world
mention
any
particular
name
it
is
certain
we
had
suspicions
and
all
i
am
afraid
fell
on
the
same
person
the
man
returned
from
the
worthy
lady
with
much
expedition
and
brought
with
him
a
canister
of
tea
despatched
with
so
true
a
generosity
as
well
as
politeness
that
if
our
voyage
had
been
as
long
again
we
should
have
incurred
no
danger
of
being
brought
to
a
short
allowance
in
this
most
important
article
at
the
very
same
instant
likewise
arrived
william
the
footman
with
our
own
it
had
been
indeed
left
in
the
hoy
when
the
other
goods
were
as
william
when
he
first
heard
it
was
missing
had
suspected
and
whence
had
not
the
owner
of
the
hoy
been
unluckily
out
of
the
way
he
had
retrieved
it
soon
enough
to
have
prevented
our
giving
the
lady
an
opportunity
of
displaying
some
part
of
her
goodness
to
search
the
hoy
was
indeed
too
natural
a
suggestion
to
have
escaped
any
one
nor
did
it
escape
being
mentioned
by
many
of
us
but
we
were
dissuaded
from
it
by
my
wife
maid
who
perfectly
well
remembered
she
had
left
the
chest
in
the
for
that
she
had
never
given
it
out
of
her
hand
in
her
way
to
or
from
the
hoy
but
william
perhaps
knew
the
maid
better
and
best
understood
how
far
she
was
to
be
believed
for
otherwise
he
would
hardly
of
his
own
accord
after
hearing
her
declaration
have
hunted
out
the
with
much
pains
and
difficulty
thus
ended
this
scene
which
began
with
such
appearance
of
distress
and
ended
with
becoming
the
subject
of
mirth
and
laughter
nothing
now
remained
but
to
pay
our
taxes
which
were
indeed
laid
with
inconceivable
severity
lodging
was
raised
sixpence
fire
in
the
same
proportion
and
even
candles
which
had
hitherto
escaped
were
charged
with
a
wantonness
of
imposition
from
the
beginning
and
placed
under
the
style
of
oversight
we
were
raised
a
whole
pound
whereas
we
had
only
burned
ten
in
five
nights
and
the
pound
consisted
of
lastly
an
attempt
was
made
which
almost
as
far
exceeds
human
credulity
to
believe
as
it
did
human
patience
to
submit
to
this
was
to
make
us
pay
as
much
for
existing
an
hour
or
two
as
for
existing
a
whole
day
and
dressing
dinner
was
introduced
as
an
article
though
we
left
the
house
before
either
pot
or
spit
had
approached
the
fire
here
i
own
my
patience
failed
me
and
i
became
an
example
of
the
truth
of
the
observation
that
all
tyranny
and
oppression
may
be
carried
too
far
and
that
a
yoke
may
be
made
too
intolerable
for
the
neck
of
the
tamest
slave
when
i
remonstrated
with
some
warmth
against
this
grievance
francis
gave
me
a
look
and
left
the
room
without
making
any
answer
she
returned
in
a
minute
running
to
me
with
pen
ink
and
paper
in
her
hand
and
desired
me
to
make
my
own
bill
for
she
hoped
she
said
i
did
not
expect
that
her
house
was
to
be
dirtied
and
her
goods
spoiled
and
consumed
for
nothing
the
whole
is
but
thirteen
shillings
can
gentlefolks
lie
a
whole
night
at
a
for
less
if
they
can
i
am
sure
it
is
time
to
give
off
being
a
landlady
but
pay
me
what
you
please
i
would
have
people
know
that
i
value
money
as
little
as
other
folks
but
i
was
always
a
fool
as
i
says
to
my
husband
and
never
knows
which
side
my
bread
is
buttered
of
and
yet
to
be
sure
your
honor
shall
be
my
warning
not
to
be
bit
so
again
some
folks
knows
better
than
other
some
how
to
make
their
bills
candles
why
yes
to
be
sure
why
should
not
travelers
pay
for
candles
i
am
sure
i
pays
for
my
candles
and
the
chandler
pays
the
king
majesty
for
them
and
if
he
did
not
i
must
so
as
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
in
the
end
to
be
sure
i
am
out
of
sixteens
at
present
but
these
burn
as
white
and
as
clear
though
not
quite
so
large
i
expects
my
chandler
here
soon
or
i
would
send
to
portsmouth
if
your
honor
was
to
stay
any
time
longer
but
when
folks
stays
only
for
a
wind
you
knows
there
can
be
no
dependence
on
such
here
she
put
on
a
little
slyness
of
aspect
and
seemed
willing
to
submit
to
interruption
i
interrupted
her
accordingly
by
throwing
down
half
a
guinea
and
declared
i
had
no
more
english
money
which
was
indeed
true
and
as
she
could
not
immediately
change
the
shilling
pieces
it
put
a
final
end
to
the
dispute
francis
soon
left
the
room
and
we
soon
after
left
the
house
nor
would
this
good
woman
see
us
or
wish
us
a
good
voyage
i
must
not
however
quit
this
place
where
we
had
been
so
without
doing
it
impartial
justice
and
recording
what
may
with
the
strictest
truth
be
said
in
its
favor
first
then
as
to
its
situation
it
is
i
think
most
delightful
and
in
the
most
pleasant
spot
in
the
whole
island
it
is
true
it
wants
the
advantage
of
that
beautiful
river
which
leads
from
newport
to
cowes
but
the
prospect
here
extending
to
the
sea
and
taking
in
portsmouth
spithead
and
helen
would
be
more
than
a
recompense
for
the
loss
of
the
thames
itself
even
in
the
most
delightful
part
of
berkshire
or
buckinghamshire
though
another
denham
or
another
pope
should
unite
in
celebrating
it
for
my
own
part
i
confess
myself
so
entirely
fond
of
a
sea
prospect
that
i
think
nothing
on
the
land
can
equal
it
and
if
it
be
set
off
with
shipping
i
desire
to
borrow
no
ornament
from
the
terra
firma
a
fleet
of
ships
is
in
my
opinion
the
noblest
object
which
the
art
of
man
hath
ever
produced
and
far
beyond
the
power
of
those
architects
who
deal
in
brick
in
stone
or
in
marble
when
the
late
sir
robert
walpole
one
of
the
best
of
men
and
of
ministers
used
to
equip
us
a
yearly
fleet
at
spithead
his
enemies
of
taste
must
have
allowed
that
he
at
least
treated
the
nation
with
a
fine
sight
for
their
money
a
much
finer
indeed
than
the
same
expense
in
an
encampment
could
have
produced
for
what
indeed
is
the
best
idea
which
the
prospect
of
a
number
of
huts
can
furnish
to
the
mind
but
of
a
number
of
men
forming
themselves
into
a
society
before
the
art
of
building
more
substantial
houses
was
known
this
perhaps
would
be
agreeable
enough
but
in
truth
there
is
a
much
worse
idea
ready
to
step
in
before
it
and
that
is
of
a
body
of
the
supports
of
tyranny
the
invaders
of
the
just
liberties
and
properties
of
mankind
the
plunderers
of
the
industrious
the
ravishers
of
the
chaste
the
murderers
of
the
innocent
and
in
a
word
the
destroyers
of
the
plenty
the
peace
and
the
safety
of
their
and
what
it
may
be
said
are
these
which
seem
so
delightful
an
object
to
our
eyes
are
they
not
alike
the
support
of
tyranny
and
oppression
of
innocence
carrying
with
them
desolation
and
ruin
wherever
their
masters
please
to
send
them
this
is
indeed
too
true
and
however
the
ship
of
war
may
in
its
bulk
and
equipment
exceed
the
honest
merchantman
i
heartily
wish
there
was
no
necessity
for
it
for
though
i
must
own
the
superior
beauty
of
the
object
on
one
side
i
am
more
pleased
with
the
superior
excellence
of
the
idea
which
i
can
raise
in
my
mind
on
the
other
while
i
reflect
on
the
art
and
industry
of
mankind
engaged
in
the
daily
improvements
of
commerce
to
the
mutual
benefit
of
all
countries
and
to
the
establishment
and
happiness
of
social
life
this
pleasant
village
is
situated
on
a
gentle
ascent
from
the
water
whence
it
affords
that
charming
prospect
i
have
above
described
its
soil
is
a
gravel
which
assisted
with
its
declivity
preserves
it
always
so
dry
that
immediately
after
the
most
violent
rain
a
fine
lady
may
walk
without
wetting
her
silken
shoes
the
fertility
of
the
place
is
apparent
from
its
extraordinary
verdure
and
it
is
so
shaded
with
large
and
flourishing
elms
that
its
narrow
lanes
are
a
natural
grove
or
walk
which
in
the
regularity
of
its
plantation
vies
with
the
power
of
art
and
in
its
wanton
exuberancy
greatly
exceeds
it
in
a
field
in
the
ascent
of
this
hill
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
sea
stands
a
neat
little
chapel
it
is
very
small
but
adequate
to
the
number
of
inhabitants
for
the
parish
doth
not
seem
to
contain
above
thirty
houses
at
about
two
miles
distant
from
this
parish
lives
that
polite
and
good
lady
to
whose
kindness
we
were
so
much
obliged
it
is
placed
on
a
hill
whose
bottom
is
washed
by
the
sea
and
which
from
its
eminence
at
top
commands
a
view
of
great
part
of
the
island
as
well
as
it
does
that
of
the
opposite
shore
this
house
was
formerly
built
by
one
boyce
who
from
a
blacksmith
at
gosport
became
possessed
by
great
success
in
smuggling
of
forty
thousand
pound
with
part
of
this
he
purchased
an
estate
here
and
by
chance
probably
fixed
on
this
spot
for
building
a
large
house
perhaps
the
convenience
of
carrying
on
his
business
to
which
it
is
so
well
adapted
might
dictate
the
situation
to
him
we
can
hardly
at
least
attribute
it
to
the
same
taste
with
which
he
furnished
his
house
or
at
least
his
library
by
sending
an
order
to
a
bookseller
in
london
to
pack
him
up
five
hundred
pounds
worth
of
his
handsomest
books
they
tell
here
several
almost
incredible
stories
of
the
ignorance
the
folly
and
the
pride
which
this
poor
man
and
his
wife
discovered
during
the
short
continuance
of
his
prosperity
for
he
did
not
long
escape
the
sharp
eyes
of
the
revenue
solicitors
and
was
by
extents
from
the
court
of
exchequer
soon
reduced
below
his
original
state
to
that
of
confinement
in
the
fleet
all
his
effects
were
sold
and
among
the
rest
his
books
by
an
auction
at
portsmouth
for
a
very
small
price
for
the
bookseller
was
now
discovered
to
have
been
perfectly
a
master
of
his
trade
and
relying
on
boyce
finding
little
time
to
read
had
sent
him
not
only
the
most
lasting
wares
of
his
shop
but
duplicates
of
the
same
under
different
titles
his
estate
and
house
were
purchased
by
a
gentleman
of
these
parts
whose
widow
now
enjoys
them
and
who
hath
improved
them
particularly
her
gardens
with
so
elegant
a
taste
that
the
painter
who
would
assist
his
imagination
in
the
composition
of
a
most
exquisite
landscape
or
the
poet
who
would
describe
an
earthly
paradise
could
nowhere
furnish
themselves
with
a
richer
pattern
we
left
this
place
about
eleven
in
the
morning
and
were
again
conveyed
with
more
sunshine
than
wind
aboard
our
ship
whence
our
captain
had
acquired
his
power
of
prophecy
when
he
promised
us
and
himself
a
prosperous
wind
i
will
not
determine
it
is
sufficient
to
observe
that
he
was
a
false
prophet
and
that
the
weathercocks
continued
to
point
as
before
he
would
not
however
so
easily
give
up
his
skill
in
prediction
he
persevered
in
asserting
that
the
wind
was
changed
and
having
weighed
his
anchor
fell
down
that
afternoon
to
helen
which
was
at
about
the
distance
of
five
miles
and
whither
his
friend
the
tide
in
defiance
of
the
wind
which
was
most
manifestly
against
him
softly
wafted
him
in
as
many
hours
here
about
seven
in
the
evening
before
which
time
we
could
not
procure
it
we
sat
down
to
regale
ourselves
with
some
roasted
venison
which
was
much
better
dressed
than
we
imagined
it
would
be
and
an
excellent
cold
pasty
which
my
wife
had
made
at
ryde
and
which
we
had
reserved
uncut
to
eat
on
board
our
ship
whither
we
all
cheerfully
exulted
in
being
returned
from
the
presence
of
francis
who
by
the
exact
resemblance
she
bore
to
a
fury
seemed
to
have
been
with
no
great
propriety
settled
in
paradise
friday
july
as
we
passed
by
spithead
on
the
preceding
evening
we
saw
the
two
regiments
of
soldiers
who
were
just
returned
from
gibraltar
and
minorca
and
this
day
a
lieutenant
belonging
to
one
of
them
who
was
the
captain
nephew
came
to
pay
a
visit
to
his
uncle
he
was
what
is
called
by
some
a
very
pretty
fellow
indeed
much
too
pretty
a
fellow
at
his
years
for
he
was
turned
of
though
his
address
and
conversation
would
have
become
him
more
before
he
had
reached
twenty
in
his
conversation
it
is
true
there
was
something
military
enough
as
it
consisted
chiefly
of
oaths
and
of
the
great
actions
and
wise
sayings
of
jack
and
will
and
tom
of
our
regiment
a
phrase
eternally
in
his
mouth
and
he
seemed
to
conclude
that
it
conveyed
to
all
the
officers
such
a
degree
of
public
notoriety
and
importance
that
it
entitled
him
like
the
head
of
a
profession
or
a
first
minister
to
be
the
subject
of
conversation
among
those
who
had
not
the
least
personal
acquaintance
with
him
this
did
not
much
surprise
me
as
i
have
seen
several
examples
of
the
same
but
the
defects
in
his
address
especially
to
the
women
were
so
great
that
they
seemed
absolutely
inconsistent
with
the
behavior
of
a
pretty
fellow
much
less
of
one
in
a
red
coat
and
yet
besides
having
been
eleven
years
in
the
army
he
had
had
as
his
uncle
informed
me
an
education
in
france
this
i
own
would
have
appeared
to
have
been
absolutely
thrown
away
had
not
his
animal
spirits
which
were
likewise
thrown
away
upon
him
in
great
abundance
borne
the
visible
stamp
of
the
growth
of
that
country
the
character
to
which
he
had
an
indisputable
title
was
that
of
a
merry
fellow
so
very
merry
was
he
that
he
laughed
at
everything
he
said
and
always
before
he
spoke
possibly
indeed
he
often
laughed
at
what
he
did
not
utter
for
every
speech
begun
with
a
laugh
though
it
did
not
always
end
with
a
jest
there
was
no
great
analogy
between
the
characters
of
the
uncle
and
the
nephew
and
yet
they
seemed
entirely
to
agree
in
enjoying
the
honor
which
the
did
to
his
family
this
the
uncle
expressed
with
great
pleasure
in
his
countenance
and
seemed
desirous
of
showing
all
present
the
honor
which
he
had
for
his
nephew
who
on
his
side
was
at
some
pains
to
convince
us
of
his
concurring
in
this
opinion
and
at
the
same
time
of
displaying
the
contempt
he
had
for
the
parts
as
well
as
the
occupation
of
his
uncle
which
he
seemed
to
think
reflected
some
disgrace
on
himself
who
was
a
member
of
that
profession
which
makes
every
man
a
gentleman
not
that
i
would
be
understood
to
insinuate
that
the
nephew
endeavored
to
shake
off
or
disown
his
uncle
or
indeed
to
keep
him
at
any
distance
on
the
contrary
he
treated
him
with
the
utmost
familiarity
often
calling
him
dick
and
dear
dick
and
old
dick
and
frequently
beginning
an
oration
with
d
n
me
dick
all
this
condescension
on
the
part
of
the
young
man
was
received
with
suitable
marks
of
complaisance
and
obligation
by
the
old
one
especially
when
it
was
attended
with
evidences
of
the
same
familiarity
with
general
officers
and
other
persons
of
rank
one
of
whom
in
particular
i
know
to
have
the
pride
and
insolence
of
the
devil
himself
and
who
without
some
strong
bias
of
interest
is
no
more
liable
to
converse
familiarly
with
a
lieutenant
than
of
being
mistaken
in
his
judgment
of
a
fool
which
was
not
perhaps
so
certainly
the
case
of
the
worthy
lieutenant
who
in
declaring
to
us
the
qualifications
which
recommended
men
to
his
countenance
and
conversation
as
well
as
what
effectually
set
a
bar
to
all
hopes
of
that
honor
exclaimed
no
sir
by
the
d
i
hate
all
fools
no
d
n
me
excuse
me
for
that
that
a
little
too
much
old
dick
there
are
two
or
three
officers
of
our
regiment
whom
i
know
to
be
fools
but
d
n
me
if
i
am
ever
seen
in
their
company
if
a
man
hath
a
fool
of
a
relation
dick
you
know
he
ca
help
that
old
boy
such
jokes
as
these
the
old
man
not
only
tools
in
good
part
but
glibly
gulped
down
the
whole
narrative
of
his
nephew
nor
did
he
i
am
convinced
in
the
least
doubt
of
our
as
readily
swallowing
the
same
this
made
him
so
charmed
with
the
lieutenant
that
it
is
probable
we
should
have
been
pestered
with
him
the
whole
evening
had
not
the
north
wind
dearer
to
our
even
than
this
glory
of
his
family
sprung
suddenly
up
and
called
aloud
to
him
to
weigh
his
anchor
while
this
ceremony
was
performing
the
ordered
out
his
boat
to
row
the
to
shore
not
indeed
on
an
uninhabited
island
but
one
which
in
this
part
looked
but
little
better
not
presenting
us
the
view
of
a
single
house
indeed
our
old
friend
when
his
boat
returned
on
shore
perhaps
being
no
longer
able
to
stifle
his
envy
of
the
superiority
of
his
nephew
told
us
with
a
smile
that
the
young
man
had
a
good
five
mile
to
walk
before
he
could
be
accommodated
with
a
passage
to
portsmouth
it
appeared
now
that
the
captain
had
been
only
mistaken
in
the
date
of
his
prediction
by
placing
the
event
a
day
earlier
than
it
happened
for
the
wind
which
now
arose
was
not
only
favorable
but
brisk
and
was
no
sooner
in
reach
of
our
sails
than
it
swept
us
away
by
the
back
of
the
isle
of
wight
and
having
in
the
night
carried
us
by
christchurch
and
brought
us
the
next
noon
saturday
july
oft
the
island
of
portland
so
famous
for
the
smallness
and
sweetness
of
its
mutton
of
which
a
leg
seldom
weighs
four
pounds
we
would
have
bought
a
sheep
but
our
captain
would
not
permit
it
though
he
needed
not
have
been
in
such
a
hurry
for
presently
the
wind
i
will
not
positively
assert
in
resentment
of
his
surliness
showed
him
a
dog
trick
and
slyly
slipped
back
again
to
his
in
the
the
captain
now
grew
outrageous
and
declaring
open
war
with
the
wind
took
a
resolution
rather
more
bold
than
wise
of
sailing
in
defiance
of
it
and
in
its
teeth
he
swore
he
would
let
go
his
anchor
no
more
but
would
beat
the
sea
while
he
had
either
yard
or
sail
left
he
accordingly
stood
from
the
shore
and
made
so
large
a
tack
that
before
night
though
he
seemed
to
advance
but
little
on
his
way
he
was
got
out
of
sight
of
land
towards
evening
the
wind
began
in
the
captain
own
language
and
indeed
it
freshened
so
much
that
before
ten
it
blew
a
perfect
hurricane
the
captain
having
got
as
he
supposed
to
a
safe
distance
tacked
again
towards
the
english
shore
and
now
the
wind
veered
a
point
only
in
his
favor
and
continued
to
blow
with
such
violence
that
the
ship
ran
above
eight
knots
or
miles
an
hour
during
this
whole
day
and
tempestuous
night
till
i
was
obliged
to
betake
myself
once
more
to
my
solitude
for
my
women
were
again
all
down
in
their
and
the
captain
was
busy
on
deck
for
he
began
to
grow
uneasy
chiefly
i
believe
because
he
did
not
well
know
where
he
was
and
would
i
am
convinced
have
been
very
glad
to
have
been
in
eating
some
broth
having
contracted
no
great
degree
of
by
living
a
whole
day
alone
without
a
single
soul
to
converse
with
i
took
but
ill
physic
to
purge
it
off
by
a
with
the
captain
who
amongst
many
bitter
lamentations
of
his
fate
and
protesting
he
had
more
patience
than
a
job
frequently
intermixed
summons
to
the
commanding
officer
on
the
deck
who
now
happened
to
be
one
morrison
a
carpenter
the
only
fellow
that
had
either
common
sense
or
common
civility
in
the
ship
of
morrison
he
inquired
every
quarter
of
an
hour
concerning
the
state
of
affairs
the
wind
the
care
of
the
ship
and
other
matters
of
navigation
the
frequency
of
these
summons
as
well
as
the
solicitude
with
which
they
were
made
sufficiently
testified
the
state
of
the
captain
mind
he
endeavored
to
conceal
it
and
would
have
given
no
small
alarm
to
a
man
who
had
either
not
learned
what
it
is
to
die
or
known
what
it
is
to
be
miserable
and
my
dear
wife
and
child
must
pardon
me
if
what
i
did
not
conceive
to
be
any
great
evil
to
myself
i
was
not
much
terrified
with
the
thoughts
of
happening
to
them
in
truth
i
have
often
thought
they
are
both
too
good
and
too
gentle
to
be
trusted
to
the
power
of
any
man
i
know
to
whom
they
could
possibly
be
so
trusted
can
i
say
then
i
had
no
fear
indeed
i
can
not
reader
i
was
afraid
for
thee
lest
thou
shouldst
have
been
deprived
of
that
pleasure
thou
art
now
enjoying
and
that
i
should
not
live
to
draw
out
on
paper
that
military
character
which
thou
didst
peruse
in
the
journal
of
yesterday
from
all
these
fears
we
were
relieved
at
six
in
the
morning
by
the
arrival
of
morrison
who
acquainted
us
that
he
was
sure
he
beheld
land
very
near
for
he
could
not
see
half
a
mile
by
reason
of
the
haziness
of
the
weather
this
land
he
said
was
he
believed
the
which
forms
one
side
of
torbay
the
captain
declared
that
it
was
impossible
and
swore
on
condition
he
was
right
he
would
give
him
his
mother
for
a
maid
a
forfeit
which
became
afterwards
strictly
due
and
payable
for
the
captain
whipping
on
his
ran
up
without
his
breeches
and
within
half
an
hour
returning
into
the
cabin
wished
me
joy
of
our
lying
safe
at
anchor
in
the
bay
sunday
july
things
now
began
to
put
on
an
aspect
very
different
from
what
they
had
lately
worn
the
news
that
the
ship
had
almost
lost
its
mizzen
and
that
we
had
procured
very
fine
clouted
cream
and
fresh
bread
and
butter
from
the
shore
restored
health
and
spirits
to
our
women
and
we
all
sat
down
to
a
very
cheerful
breakfast
but
however
pleasant
our
stay
promised
to
be
here
we
were
all
desirous
it
should
be
short
i
resolved
immediately
to
despatch
my
man
into
the
country
to
purchase
a
present
of
cider
for
my
friends
of
that
which
is
called
southam
as
well
as
to
take
with
me
a
hogshead
of
it
to
lisbon
for
it
is
in
my
opinion
much
more
delicious
than
that
which
is
the
growth
of
herefordshire
i
purchased
three
hogsheads
for
five
pounds
ten
shillings
all
which
i
should
have
scarce
thought
worth
mentioning
had
i
not
believed
it
might
be
of
equal
service
to
the
honest
farmer
who
sold
it
me
and
who
is
by
the
neighboring
gentlemen
reputed
to
deal
in
the
very
best
and
to
the
reader
who
from
ignorance
of
the
means
of
providing
better
for
himself
swallows
at
a
dearer
rate
the
juice
of
middlesex
turnip
instead
of
that
vinum
pomonae
which
giles
leverance
of
cheeshurst
near
dartmouth
in
devon
will
at
the
price
of
forty
shillings
per
hogshead
send
in
double
casks
to
any
part
of
the
world
had
the
wind
been
very
sudden
in
shifting
i
had
lost
my
cider
by
an
attempt
of
a
boatman
to
exact
according
to
custom
he
required
five
shillings
for
conveying
my
man
a
mile
and
a
half
to
the
shore
and
four
more
if
he
stayed
to
bring
him
back
this
i
thought
to
be
such
insufferable
impudence
that
i
ordered
him
to
be
immediately
chased
from
the
ship
without
any
answer
indeed
there
are
few
inconveniences
that
i
would
not
rather
encounter
than
encourage
the
insolent
demands
of
these
wretches
at
the
expense
of
my
own
indignation
of
which
i
own
they
are
not
the
only
objects
but
rather
those
who
purchase
a
paltry
convenience
by
encouraging
them
but
of
this
i
have
already
spoken
very
largely
i
shall
conclude
therefore
with
the
leave
which
this
fellow
took
of
our
ship
saying
he
should
know
it
again
and
would
not
put
off
from
the
shore
to
relieve
it
in
any
distress
whatever
it
will
doubtless
surprise
many
of
my
readers
to
hear
that
when
we
lay
at
anchor
within
a
mile
or
two
of
a
town
several
days
together
and
even
in
the
most
temperate
weather
we
should
frequently
want
fresh
provisions
and
herbage
and
other
emoluments
of
the
shore
as
much
as
if
we
had
been
a
hundred
leagues
from
land
and
this
too
while
numbers
of
boats
were
in
our
sight
whose
owners
get
their
livelihood
by
rowing
people
up
and
down
and
could
be
at
any
time
summoned
by
a
signal
to
our
assistance
and
while
the
captain
had
a
little
boat
of
his
own
with
men
always
ready
to
row
it
at
his
command
this
however
hath
been
partly
accounted
for
already
by
the
imposing
disposition
of
the
people
who
asked
so
much
more
than
the
proper
price
of
their
labor
and
as
to
the
usefulness
of
the
captain
boat
it
requires
to
be
a
little
expatiated
upon
as
it
will
tend
to
lay
open
some
of
the
grievances
which
demand
the
utmost
regard
of
our
legislature
as
they
affect
the
most
valuable
part
of
the
subjects
those
by
whom
the
commerce
of
the
nation
is
carried
into
execution
our
captain
then
who
was
a
very
good
and
experienced
seaman
having
been
above
thirty
years
the
master
of
a
vessel
part
of
which
he
had
served
so
he
phrased
it
as
commander
of
a
privateer
and
had
discharged
himself
with
great
courage
and
conduct
and
with
as
great
success
discovered
the
utmost
aversion
to
the
sending
his
boat
ashore
whenever
we
lay
in
any
of
our
harbors
this
aversion
did
not
arise
from
any
fear
of
wearing
out
his
boat
by
using
it
but
was
in
truth
the
result
of
experience
that
it
was
easier
to
send
his
men
on
shore
than
to
recall
them
they
acknowledged
him
to
be
their
master
while
they
remained
on
shipboard
but
did
not
allow
his
power
to
extend
to
the
shores
where
they
had
no
sooner
set
their
foot
than
every
man
became
sui
juris
and
thought
himself
at
full
liberty
to
return
when
he
pleased
now
it
is
not
any
delight
that
these
fellows
have
in
the
fresh
air
or
verdant
fields
on
the
land
every
one
of
them
would
prefer
his
ship
and
his
hammock
to
all
the
sweets
of
arabia
the
happy
but
unluckily
for
them
there
are
in
every
seaport
in
england
certain
houses
whose
chief
livelihood
depends
on
providing
entertainment
for
the
gentlemen
of
the
jacket
for
this
purpose
they
are
always
well
furnished
with
those
cordial
liquors
which
do
immediately
inspire
the
heart
with
gladness
banishing
all
careful
thoughts
and
indeed
all
others
from
the
mind
and
opening
the
mouth
with
songs
of
cheerfulness
and
thanksgiving
for
the
many
wonderful
blessings
with
which
a
seafaring
life
overflows
for
my
own
part
however
whimsical
it
may
appear
i
confess
i
have
thought
the
strange
story
of
circe
in
the
odyssey
no
other
than
an
ingenious
allegory
in
which
homer
intended
to
convey
to
his
countrymen
the
same
kind
of
instruction
which
we
intend
to
communicate
to
our
own
in
this
digression
as
teaching
the
art
of
war
to
the
greeks
was
the
plain
design
of
the
iliad
so
was
teaching
them
the
art
of
navigation
the
no
less
manifest
intention
of
the
odyssey
for
the
improvement
of
this
their
situation
was
most
excellently
adapted
and
accordingly
we
find
thucydides
in
the
beginning
of
his
history
considers
the
greeks
as
a
set
of
pirates
or
privateers
plundering
each
other
by
sea
this
being
probably
the
first
institution
of
commerce
before
the
ars
cauponaria
was
invented
and
merchants
instead
of
robbing
began
to
cheat
and
outwit
each
other
and
by
degrees
changed
the
metabletic
the
only
kind
of
traffic
allowed
by
aristotle
in
his
politics
into
the
chrematistic
by
this
allegory
then
i
suppose
ulysses
to
have
been
the
captain
of
a
and
circe
some
good
who
made
his
crew
drunk
with
the
spirituous
liquors
of
those
days
with
this
the
transformation
into
swine
as
well
as
all
other
incidents
of
the
fable
will
notably
agree
and
thus
a
key
will
be
found
out
for
unlocking
the
whole
mystery
and
forging
at
least
some
meaning
to
a
story
which
at
present
appears
very
strange
and
absurd
hence
moreover
will
appear
the
very
near
resemblance
between
the
men
of
all
ages
and
nations
and
here
perhaps
may
be
established
the
truth
and
justice
of
that
observation
which
will
occur
oftener
than
once
in
this
voyage
that
all
human
flesh
is
not
the
same
flesh
but
that
there
is
one
kind
of
flesh
of
landmen
and
another
of
seamen
philosophers
divines
and
others
who
have
treated
the
gratification
of
human
appetites
with
contempt
have
among
other
instances
insisted
very
strongly
on
that
satiety
which
is
so
apt
to
overtake
them
even
in
the
very
act
of
enjoyment
and
here
they
more
particularly
deserve
our
attention
as
most
of
them
may
be
supposed
to
speak
from
their
own
experience
and
very
probably
gave
us
their
lessons
with
a
full
stomach
thus
hunger
and
thirst
whatever
delight
they
may
afford
while
we
are
eating
and
drinking
pass
both
away
from
us
with
the
plate
and
the
cup
and
though
we
should
imitate
the
romans
if
indeed
they
were
such
dull
beasts
which
i
can
scarce
believe
to
unload
the
belly
like
a
in
order
to
fill
it
again
with
another
load
yet
would
the
pleasure
be
so
considerably
lessened
that
it
would
scarce
repay
us
the
trouble
of
purchasing
it
with
swallowing
a
basin
of
camomile
tea
a
second
haunch
of
venison
or
a
second
dose
of
turtle
would
hardly
allure
a
city
glutton
with
its
smell
even
the
celebrated
jew
himself
when
well
filled
with
calipash
and
calipee
goes
contentedly
home
to
tell
his
money
and
expects
no
more
pleasure
from
his
throat
during
the
next
hours
hence
i
suppose
south
took
that
elegant
comparison
of
the
joys
of
a
speculative
man
to
the
solemn
silence
of
an
archimedes
over
a
problem
and
those
of
a
glutton
to
the
stillness
of
a
sow
at
her
a
simile
which
if
it
became
the
pulpit
at
all
could
only
become
it
in
the
afternoon
whereas
in
those
potations
which
the
mind
seems
to
enjoy
rather
than
the
bodily
appetite
there
is
happily
no
such
satiety
but
the
more
a
man
drinks
the
more
he
desires
as
if
like
mark
anthony
in
dryden
his
appetite
increased
with
feeding
and
this
to
such
an
immoderate
degree
ut
nullus
sit
desiderio
aut
pudor
aut
modus
hence
as
with
the
gang
of
captain
ulysses
ensues
so
total
a
transformation
that
the
man
no
more
continues
what
he
was
perhaps
he
ceases
for
a
time
to
be
at
all
or
though
he
may
retain
the
same
outward
form
and
figure
he
had
before
yet
is
his
nobler
part
as
we
are
taught
to
call
it
so
changed
that
instead
of
being
the
same
man
he
scarce
remembers
what
he
was
a
few
hours
before
and
this
transformation
being
once
obtained
is
so
easily
preserved
by
the
same
potations
which
induced
no
satiety
that
the
captain
in
vain
sends
or
goes
in
quest
of
his
crew
they
know
him
no
longer
or
if
they
do
they
acknowledge
not
his
power
having
indeed
as
entirely
forgotten
themselves
as
if
they
had
taken
a
large
draught
of
the
river
of
lethe
nor
is
the
captain
always
sure
of
even
finding
out
the
place
to
which
circe
hath
conveyed
them
there
are
many
of
those
houses
in
every
nay
there
are
some
where
the
sorceress
doth
not
trust
only
to
her
drugs
but
hath
instruments
of
a
different
kind
to
execute
her
purposes
by
whose
means
the
tar
is
effectually
secreted
from
the
knowledge
and
pursuit
of
his
captain
this
would
indeed
be
very
fatal
was
it
not
for
one
circumstance
that
the
sailor
is
seldom
provided
with
the
proper
bait
for
these
harpies
however
the
contrary
sometimes
happens
as
these
harpies
will
bite
at
almost
anything
and
will
snap
at
a
pair
of
silver
buttons
or
buckles
as
surely
as
at
the
specie
itself
nay
sometimes
they
are
so
voracious
that
the
very
naked
hook
will
go
down
and
the
jolly
young
sailor
is
sacrificed
for
his
own
sake
in
vain
at
such
a
season
as
this
would
the
vows
of
a
pious
heathen
have
prevailed
over
neptune
aeolus
or
any
other
marine
deity
in
vain
would
the
prayers
of
a
christian
captain
be
attended
with
the
like
success
the
wind
may
change
how
it
pleases
while
all
hands
are
on
shore
the
anchor
would
remain
firm
in
the
ground
and
the
ship
would
continue
in
durance
unless
like
other
forcible
it
forcibly
got
loose
for
no
good
purpose
now
as
the
favor
of
winds
and
courts
and
such
like
is
always
to
be
laid
hold
on
at
the
very
first
motion
for
within
hours
all
may
be
changed
again
so
in
the
former
case
the
loss
of
a
day
may
be
the
loss
of
a
voyage
for
though
it
may
appear
to
persons
not
well
skilled
in
navigation
who
see
ships
meet
and
sail
by
each
other
that
the
wind
blows
sometimes
east
and
west
north
and
south
backwards
and
forwards
at
the
same
instant
yet
certain
it
is
that
the
land
is
so
contrived
that
even
the
same
wind
will
not
like
the
same
horse
always
bring
a
man
to
the
end
of
his
journey
but
that
the
gale
which
the
mariner
prayed
heartily
for
yesterday
he
may
as
heartily
deprecate
while
all
use
and
benefit
which
would
have
arisen
to
him
from
the
westerly
wind
of
may
be
totally
lost
and
thrown
away
by
neglecting
the
offer
of
the
easterly
blast
which
blows
hence
ensues
grief
and
disreputation
to
the
innocent
captain
loss
and
disappointment
to
the
worthy
merchant
and
not
seldom
great
prejudice
to
the
trade
of
a
nation
whose
manufactures
are
thus
liable
to
lie
unsold
in
a
foreign
warehouse
the
market
being
forestalled
by
some
rival
whose
sailors
are
under
a
better
discipline
to
guard
against
these
inconveniences
the
prudent
captain
takes
every
precaution
in
his
power
he
makes
the
strongest
contracts
with
his
crew
and
thereby
binds
them
so
firmly
that
none
but
the
greatest
or
least
of
men
can
break
through
them
with
impunity
but
for
one
of
these
two
reasons
which
i
will
not
determine
the
sailor
like
his
brother
fish
the
eel
is
too
slippery
to
be
held
and
plunges
into
his
element
with
perfect
impunity
to
speak
a
plain
truth
there
is
no
trusting
to
any
contract
with
one
whom
the
wise
citizens
of
london
call
a
bad
man
for
with
such
a
one
though
your
bond
be
ever
so
strong
it
will
prove
in
the
end
good
for
nothing
what
then
is
to
be
done
in
this
case
what
indeed
but
to
call
in
the
assistance
of
that
tremendous
magistrate
the
justice
of
peace
who
can
and
often
doth
lay
good
and
bad
men
in
equal
durance
and
though
he
seldom
cares
to
stretch
his
bonds
to
what
is
great
never
finds
anything
too
minute
for
their
detention
but
will
hold
the
smallest
reptile
alive
so
fast
in
his
noose
that
he
can
never
get
out
till
he
is
let
drop
through
it
why
therefore
upon
the
breach
of
those
contracts
should
not
an
immediate
application
be
made
to
the
nearest
magistrate
of
this
order
who
should
be
empowered
to
convey
the
delinquent
either
to
ship
or
to
prison
at
the
election
of
the
captain
to
be
fettered
by
the
leg
in
either
place
but
as
the
case
now
stands
the
condition
of
this
poor
captain
without
any
commission
and
of
this
absolute
commander
without
any
power
is
much
worse
than
we
have
hitherto
shown
it
to
be
for
notwithstanding
all
the
aforesaid
contracts
to
sail
in
the
good
ship
the
elizabeth
if
the
sailor
should
for
better
wages
find
it
more
his
interest
to
go
on
board
the
better
ship
the
mary
either
before
their
setting
out
or
on
their
speedy
meeting
in
some
port
he
may
prefer
the
latter
without
any
other
danger
than
that
of
doing
what
he
ought
not
to
have
done
contrary
to
a
rule
which
he
is
seldom
christian
enough
to
have
much
at
heart
while
the
captain
is
generally
too
good
a
christian
to
punish
a
man
out
of
revenge
only
when
he
is
to
be
at
a
considerable
expense
for
so
doing
there
are
many
other
deficiencies
in
our
laws
relating
to
maritime
affairs
and
which
would
probably
have
been
long
since
corrected
had
we
any
seamen
in
the
house
of
commons
not
that
i
would
insinuate
that
the
legislature
wants
a
supply
of
many
gentlemen
in
the
but
as
these
gentlemen
are
by
their
attendance
in
the
house
unfortunately
prevented
from
ever
going
to
sea
and
there
learning
what
they
might
communicate
to
their
landed
brethren
these
latter
remain
as
ignorant
in
that
branch
of
knowledge
as
they
would
be
if
none
but
courtiers
and
had
been
elected
into
parliament
without
a
single
fish
among
them
the
following
seems
to
me
to
be
an
effect
of
this
kind
and
it
strikes
me
the
stronger
as
i
remember
the
case
to
have
happened
and
remember
it
to
have
been
dispunishable
a
captain
of
a
trading
vessel
of
which
he
was
part
owner
took
in
a
large
freight
of
oats
at
liverpool
consigned
to
the
market
at
bearkey
this
he
carried
to
a
port
in
hampshire
and
there
sold
it
as
his
own
and
freighting
his
vessel
with
wheat
for
the
port
of
cadiz
in
spain
dropped
it
at
oporto
in
his
way
and
there
selling
it
for
his
own
use
took
in
a
lading
of
wine
with
which
he
sailed
again
and
having
converted
it
in
the
same
manner
together
with
a
large
sum
of
money
with
which
he
was
intrusted
for
the
benefit
of
certain
merchants
sold
the
ship
and
cargo
in
another
port
and
then
wisely
sat
down
contented
with
the
fortune
he
had
made
and
returned
to
london
to
enjoy
the
remainder
of
his
days
with
the
fruits
of
his
former
labors
and
a
good
conscience
the
sum
he
brought
home
with
him
consisted
of
near
six
thousand
pounds
all
in
specie
and
most
of
it
in
that
coin
which
portugal
distributes
so
liberally
over
europe
he
was
not
yet
old
enough
to
be
past
all
sense
of
pleasure
nor
so
puffed
up
with
the
pride
of
his
good
fortune
as
to
overlook
his
old
acquaintances
the
journeymen
tailors
from
among
whom
he
had
been
formerly
pressed
into
the
and
having
there
laid
the
foundation
of
his
future
success
by
his
shares
in
prizes
had
afterwards
become
captain
of
a
trading
vessel
in
which
he
purchased
an
interest
and
had
soon
begun
to
trade
in
the
honorable
manner
above
mentioned
the
captain
now
took
up
his
residence
at
an
in
where
having
all
his
money
by
him
in
a
trunk
he
spent
about
five
pounds
a
day
among
his
old
friends
the
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
those
parts
the
merchant
of
liverpool
having
luckily
had
notice
from
a
friend
during
the
blaze
of
his
fortune
did
by
the
assistance
of
a
justice
of
peace
without
the
assistance
of
the
law
recover
his
whole
loss
the
captain
however
wisely
chose
to
refund
no
more
but
perceiving
with
what
hasty
strides
envy
was
pursuing
his
fortune
he
took
speedy
means
to
retire
out
of
her
reach
and
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
his
wealth
in
an
inglorious
obscurity
nor
could
the
same
justice
overtake
him
time
enough
to
assist
a
second
merchant
as
he
had
done
the
first
this
was
a
very
extraordinary
case
and
the
more
so
as
the
ingenious
gentleman
had
steered
entirely
clear
of
all
crimes
in
our
law
now
how
it
comes
about
that
a
robbery
so
very
easy
to
be
committed
and
to
which
there
is
such
immediate
temptation
always
before
the
eyes
of
these
fellows
should
receive
the
encouragement
of
impunity
is
to
be
accounted
for
only
from
the
oversight
of
the
legislature
as
that
oversight
can
only
be
i
think
derived
from
the
reasons
i
have
assigned
for
it
but
i
will
dwell
no
longer
on
this
subject
if
what
i
have
here
said
should
seem
of
sufficient
consequence
to
engage
the
attention
of
any
man
in
power
and
should
thus
be
the
means
of
applying
any
remedy
to
the
most
inveterate
evils
at
least
i
have
obtained
my
whole
desire
and
shall
have
lain
so
long
in
the
ports
of
this
kingdom
to
some
purpose
i
would
indeed
have
this
work
which
if
i
should
live
to
finish
it
a
matter
of
no
great
certainty
if
indeed
of
any
great
hope
to
me
will
be
probably
the
last
i
shall
ever
undertake
to
produce
some
better
end
than
the
mere
diversion
of
the
reader
this
day
our
captain
went
ashore
to
dine
with
a
gentleman
who
lives
in
these
parts
and
who
so
exactly
resembles
the
character
given
by
homer
of
axylus
that
the
only
difference
i
can
trace
between
them
is
the
one
living
by
the
highway
erected
his
hospitality
chiefly
in
favor
of
and
the
other
living
by
the
gratified
his
humanity
by
accommodating
the
wants
of
the
mariner
in
the
evening
our
commander
received
a
visit
from
a
brother
bashaw
who
lay
in
the
same
harbor
this
latter
captain
was
a
swiss
he
was
then
master
of
a
vessel
bound
to
guinea
and
had
formerly
been
a
privateering
when
our
own
hero
was
employed
in
the
same
laudable
service
the
honesty
and
freedom
of
the
switzer
his
vivacity
in
which
he
was
in
no
respect
inferior
to
his
near
neighbors
the
french
the
awkward
and
affected
politeness
which
was
likewise
of
french
extraction
mixed
with
the
brutal
roughness
of
the
english
tar
for
he
had
served
under
the
colors
of
this
nation
and
his
crew
had
been
of
the
same
made
such
an
odd
variety
such
a
of
character
that
i
should
have
been
much
diverted
with
him
had
not
his
voice
which
was
as
loud
as
a
unfortunately
made
my
head
ache
the
noise
which
he
conveyed
into
the
deaf
ears
of
his
brother
captain
who
sat
on
one
side
of
him
the
soft
addresses
with
which
mixed
with
awkward
bows
he
saluted
the
ladies
on
the
other
were
so
agreeably
contrasted
that
a
man
must
not
only
have
been
void
of
all
taste
of
humor
and
insensible
of
mirth
but
duller
than
cibber
is
represented
in
the
dunciad
who
could
be
unentertained
with
him
a
little
while
for
i
confess
such
entertainments
should
always
be
very
short
as
they
are
very
liable
to
pall
but
he
suffered
not
this
to
happen
at
present
for
having
given
us
his
company
a
quarter
of
an
hour
only
he
retired
after
many
apologies
for
the
shortness
of
his
visit
the
wind
being
less
boisterous
than
it
had
hitherto
been
since
our
arrival
here
several
which
the
tempestuous
weather
yesterday
had
prevented
from
working
came
on
board
us
with
fish
this
was
so
fresh
so
good
in
kind
and
so
very
cheap
that
we
supplied
ourselves
in
great
numbers
among
which
were
very
large
soles
at
fourpence
a
pair
and
whitings
of
almost
a
preposterous
size
at
ninepence
a
score
the
only
fish
which
bore
any
price
was
a
john
doree
as
it
is
called
i
bought
one
of
at
least
four
pounds
weight
for
as
many
shillings
it
resembles
a
turbot
in
shape
but
exceeds
it
in
firmness
and
flavor
the
price
had
the
appearance
of
being
considerable
when
opposed
to
the
extraordinary
cheapness
of
others
of
value
but
was
in
truth
so
very
reasonable
when
estimated
by
its
goodness
that
it
left
me
under
no
other
surprise
than
how
the
gentlemen
of
this
country
not
greatly
eminent
for
the
delicacy
of
their
taste
had
discovered
the
preference
of
the
doree
to
all
other
fish
but
i
was
informed
that
quin
whose
distinguishing
tooth
hath
been
so
justly
celebrated
had
lately
visited
plymouth
and
had
done
those
honors
to
the
doree
which
are
so
justly
due
to
it
from
that
sect
of
modern
philosophers
who
with
sir
epicure
mammon
or
sir
epicure
quin
their
head
seem
more
to
delight
in
a
than
in
a
garden
as
the
old
epicureans
are
said
to
have
done
unfortunately
for
the
fishmongers
of
london
the
doree
resides
only
in
those
seas
for
could
any
of
this
company
but
convey
one
to
the
temple
of
luxury
under
the
piazza
where
macklin
the
daily
serves
up
his
rich
offerings
to
that
goddess
great
would
be
the
reward
of
that
fishmonger
in
blessings
poured
down
upon
him
from
the
goddess
as
great
would
his
merit
be
towards
the
who
could
never
be
thought
to
overrate
such
valuable
incense
and
here
having
mentioned
the
extreme
cheapness
of
fish
in
the
devonshire
sea
and
given
some
little
hint
of
the
extreme
dearness
with
which
this
commodity
is
dispensed
by
those
who
deal
in
it
in
london
i
can
not
pass
on
without
throwing
forth
an
observation
or
two
with
the
same
view
with
which
i
have
scattered
my
several
remarks
through
this
voyage
sufficiently
satisfied
in
having
finished
my
life
as
i
have
probably
lost
it
in
the
service
of
my
country
from
the
best
of
motives
though
it
should
be
attended
with
the
worst
of
success
means
are
always
in
our
power
ends
are
very
seldom
so
of
all
the
animal
foods
with
which
man
is
furnished
there
are
none
so
plenty
as
fish
a
little
rivulet
that
glides
almost
unperceived
through
a
vast
tract
of
rich
land
will
support
more
hundreds
with
the
flesh
of
its
inhabitants
than
the
meadow
will
nourish
individuals
but
if
this
be
true
of
rivers
it
is
much
truer
of
the
which
abound
with
such
immense
variety
of
fish
that
the
curious
fisherman
after
he
hath
made
his
draught
often
culls
only
the
daintiest
part
and
leaves
the
rest
of
his
prey
to
perish
on
the
shore
if
this
be
true
it
would
appear
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
which
might
be
had
in
such
abundance
and
consequently
so
cheap
as
fish
of
which
nature
seems
to
have
provided
such
inexhaustible
stores
with
some
peculiar
design
in
the
production
of
terrestrial
animals
she
proceeds
with
such
slowness
that
in
the
larger
kind
a
single
female
seldom
produces
more
than
one
and
this
again
requires
three
for
or
five
years
more
to
bring
it
to
perfection
and
though
the
lesser
quadrupeds
those
of
the
wild
kind
particularly
with
the
birds
do
multiply
much
faster
yet
can
none
of
these
bear
any
proportion
with
the
aquatic
animals
of
whom
every
female
matrix
is
furnished
with
an
annual
offspring
almost
exceeding
the
power
of
numbers
and
which
in
many
instances
at
least
a
single
year
is
capable
of
bringing
to
some
degree
of
maturity
what
then
ought
in
general
to
be
so
plentiful
what
so
cheap
as
fish
what
then
so
properly
the
food
of
the
poor
so
in
many
places
they
are
and
so
might
they
always
be
in
great
cities
which
are
always
situated
near
the
sea
or
on
the
conflux
of
large
rivers
how
comes
it
then
to
look
no
farther
abroad
for
instances
that
in
our
city
of
london
the
case
is
so
far
otherwise
that
except
that
of
sprats
there
is
not
one
poor
palate
in
a
hundred
that
knows
the
taste
of
fish
it
is
true
indeed
that
this
taste
is
generally
of
such
excellent
flavor
that
it
exceeds
the
power
of
french
cookery
to
treat
the
palates
of
the
rich
with
anything
more
exquisitely
delicate
so
that
was
fish
the
common
food
of
the
poor
it
might
put
them
too
much
upon
an
equality
with
their
betters
in
the
great
article
of
eating
in
which
at
present
in
the
opinion
of
some
the
great
difference
in
happiness
between
man
and
man
consists
but
this
argument
i
shall
treat
with
the
utmost
disdain
for
if
ortolans
were
as
big
as
buzzards
and
at
the
same
time
as
plenty
as
sparrows
i
should
hold
it
yet
reasonable
to
indulge
the
poor
with
the
dainty
and
that
for
this
cause
especially
that
the
rich
would
soon
find
a
sparrow
if
as
scarce
as
an
ortolan
to
be
much
the
greater
as
it
would
certainly
be
the
rarer
dainty
of
the
two
vanity
or
scarcity
will
be
always
the
favorite
of
luxury
but
honest
hunger
will
be
satisfied
with
plenty
not
to
search
deeper
into
the
cause
of
the
evil
i
should
think
it
abundantly
sufficient
to
propose
the
remedies
of
it
and
first
i
humbly
submit
the
absolute
necessity
of
immediately
hanging
all
the
fishmongers
within
the
bills
of
mortality
and
however
it
might
have
been
some
time
ago
the
opinion
of
mild
and
temporizing
men
that
the
evil
complained
of
might
be
removed
by
gentler
methods
i
suppose
at
this
day
there
are
none
who
do
not
see
the
impossibility
of
using
such
with
any
effect
cuncta
prius
tentanda
might
have
been
formerly
urged
with
some
plausibility
but
cuncta
prius
tentata
may
now
be
replied
for
surely
if
a
few
monopolizing
fishmongers
could
defeat
that
excellent
scheme
of
the
westminster
market
to
the
erecting
which
so
many
justices
of
peace
as
well
as
other
wise
and
learned
men
did
so
vehemently
apply
themselves
that
they
might
be
truly
said
not
only
to
have
laid
the
whole
strength
of
their
heads
but
of
their
shoulders
too
to
the
business
it
would
be
a
vain
endeavor
for
any
other
body
of
men
to
attempt
to
remove
so
stubborn
a
nuisance
if
it
should
be
doubted
whether
we
can
bring
this
case
within
the
letter
of
any
capital
law
now
subsisting
i
am
ashamed
to
own
it
can
not
for
surely
no
crime
better
deserves
such
punishment
but
the
remedy
may
nevertheless
be
immediate
and
if
a
law
was
made
at
the
beginning
of
next
session
to
take
place
immediately
by
which
the
starving
thousands
of
poor
was
declared
to
be
felony
without
benefit
of
clergy
the
fishmongers
would
be
hanged
before
the
end
of
the
session
a
second
method
of
filling
the
mouths
of
the
poor
if
not
with
loaves
at
least
with
fishes
is
to
desire
the
magistrates
to
carry
into
execution
one
at
least
out
of
near
a
hundred
acts
of
parliament
for
preserving
the
small
fry
of
the
river
of
thames
by
which
means
as
few
fish
would
satisfy
thousands
as
may
now
be
devoured
by
a
small
number
of
individuals
but
while
a
fisherman
can
break
through
the
strongest
meshes
of
an
act
of
parliament
we
may
be
assured
he
will
learn
so
to
contrive
his
own
meshes
that
the
smallest
fry
will
not
be
able
to
swim
through
them
other
methods
may
we
doubt
not
he
suggested
by
those
who
shall
attentively
consider
the
evil
here
hinted
at
but
we
have
dwelt
too
long
on
it
already
and
shall
conclude
with
observing
that
it
is
difficult
to
affirm
whether
the
atrocity
of
the
evil
itself
the
facility
of
curing
it
or
the
shameful
neglect
of
the
cure
be
the
more
scandalous
or
more
astonishing
after
having
however
gloriously
regaled
myself
with
this
food
i
was
washing
it
down
with
some
good
claret
with
my
wife
and
her
friend
in
the
cabin
when
the
captain
head
cook
house
and
ship
steward
footman
in
livery
and
out
o
secretary
and
man
all
burst
into
the
cabin
at
once
being
indeed
all
but
one
person
and
without
saying
by
your
leave
began
to
pack
half
a
hogshead
of
small
beer
in
bottles
the
necessary
consequence
of
which
must
have
been
either
a
total
stop
to
conversation
at
that
cheerful
season
when
it
is
most
agreeable
or
the
admitting
that
polyonymous
officer
aforesaid
to
the
participation
of
it
i
desired
him
therefore
to
delay
his
purpose
a
little
longer
but
he
refused
to
grant
my
request
nor
was
he
prevailed
on
to
quit
the
room
till
he
was
threatened
with
having
one
bottle
to
pack
more
than
his
number
which
then
happened
to
stand
empty
within
my
reach
with
these
menaces
he
retired
at
last
but
not
without
muttering
some
menaces
on
his
side
and
which
to
our
great
terror
he
failed
not
to
put
into
immediate
execution
our
captain
was
gone
to
dinner
this
day
with
his
swiss
brother
and
though
he
was
a
very
sober
man
was
a
little
elevated
with
some
champagne
which
as
it
cost
the
swiss
little
or
nothing
he
dispensed
at
his
table
more
liberally
than
our
hospitable
english
noblemen
put
about
those
bottles
which
the
ingenious
peter
taylor
teaches
a
led
captain
to
avoid
by
distinguishing
by
the
name
of
that
generous
liquor
which
all
humble
companions
are
taught
to
postpone
to
the
flavor
of
methuen
or
honest
port
while
our
two
captains
were
thus
regaling
themselves
and
celebrating
their
own
heroic
exploits
with
all
the
inspiration
which
the
liquor
at
least
of
wit
could
afford
them
the
polyonymous
officer
arrived
and
being
saluted
by
the
name
of
honest
tom
was
ordered
to
sit
down
and
take
his
glass
before
he
delivered
his
message
for
every
sailor
is
by
turns
his
captain
mate
over
a
cann
except
only
that
captain
bashaw
who
presides
in
a
and
who
upon
earth
has
no
other
mate
unless
it
be
another
of
the
same
bashaws
tom
had
no
sooner
swallowed
his
draught
than
he
hastily
began
his
narrative
and
faithfully
related
what
had
happened
on
board
our
ship
we
say
faithfully
though
from
what
happened
it
may
be
suspected
that
tom
chose
to
add
perhaps
only
five
or
six
immaterial
circumstances
as
is
always
i
believe
the
case
and
may
possibly
have
been
done
by
me
in
relating
this
very
story
though
it
happened
not
many
hours
ago
no
sooner
was
the
captain
informed
of
the
interruption
which
had
been
given
to
his
officer
and
indeed
to
his
orders
for
he
thought
no
time
so
convenient
as
that
of
his
absence
for
causing
any
confusion
in
the
cabin
than
he
leaped
with
such
haste
from
his
chair
that
he
had
like
to
have
broke
his
sword
with
which
he
always
begirt
himself
when
he
walked
out
of
his
ship
and
sometimes
when
he
walked
about
in
it
at
the
same
time
grasping
eagerly
that
other
implement
called
a
cockade
which
modern
soldiers
wear
on
their
helmets
with
the
same
view
as
the
ancients
did
their
crests
to
terrify
the
enemy
he
muttered
something
but
so
inarticulately
that
the
word
damn
was
only
intelligible
he
then
hastily
took
leave
of
the
swiss
captain
who
was
too
well
bred
to
press
his
stay
on
such
an
occasion
and
leaped
first
from
the
ship
to
his
boat
and
then
from
his
boat
to
his
own
ship
with
as
much
fierceness
in
his
looks
as
he
had
ever
expressed
on
boarding
his
defenseless
prey
in
the
honorable
calling
of
a
privateer
having
regained
the
middle
deck
he
paused
a
moment
while
tom
and
others
loaded
themselves
with
bottles
and
then
descending
into
the
cabin
exclaimed
with
a
thundering
voice
d
n
me
why
ar
the
bottles
stowed
in
according
to
my
orders
i
answered
him
very
mildly
that
i
had
prevented
his
man
from
doing
it
as
it
was
at
an
inconvenient
time
to
me
and
as
in
his
absence
at
least
i
esteemed
the
cabin
to
be
my
own
your
cabin
repeated
he
many
times
no
d
n
me
is
my
cabin
your
cabin
d
n
me
i
have
brought
my
hogs
to
a
fair
market
i
suppose
indeed
you
think
it
your
cabin
and
your
ship
by
your
commanding
in
it
but
i
will
command
in
it
d
n
me
i
will
show
the
world
i
am
the
commander
and
nobody
but
i
did
you
think
i
sold
you
the
command
of
my
ship
for
that
pitiful
thirty
pounds
i
wish
i
had
not
seen
you
nor
your
thirty
pounds
aboard
of
her
he
then
repeated
the
words
thirty
pounds
often
with
great
disdain
and
with
a
contempt
which
i
own
the
sum
did
not
seem
to
deserve
in
my
eye
either
in
itself
or
on
the
present
occasion
being
indeed
paid
for
the
freight
of
weight
of
human
flesh
which
is
above
fifty
per
cent
dearer
than
the
freight
of
any
other
luggage
whilst
in
reality
it
takes
up
less
room
in
fact
no
room
at
all
in
truth
the
sum
was
paid
for
nothing
more
than
for
a
liberty
to
six
persons
two
of
them
servants
to
stay
on
board
a
ship
while
she
sails
from
one
port
to
another
every
shilling
of
which
comes
clear
into
the
captain
pocket
ignorant
people
may
perhaps
imagine
especially
when
they
are
told
that
the
captain
is
obliged
to
sustain
them
that
their
diet
at
least
is
worth
something
which
may
probably
be
now
and
then
so
far
the
case
as
to
deduct
a
tenth
part
from
the
net
profits
on
this
account
but
it
was
otherwise
at
present
for
when
i
had
contracted
with
the
captain
at
a
price
which
i
by
no
means
thought
moderate
i
had
some
content
in
thinking
i
should
have
no
more
to
pay
for
my
voyage
but
i
was
whispered
that
it
was
expected
the
passengers
should
find
themselves
in
several
things
such
as
tea
wine
and
such
like
and
particularly
that
gentlemen
should
stow
of
the
latter
a
much
larger
quantity
than
they
could
use
in
order
to
leave
the
remainder
as
a
present
to
the
captain
at
the
end
of
the
voyage
and
it
was
expected
likewise
that
gentlemen
should
put
aboard
some
fresh
stores
and
the
more
of
such
things
were
put
aboard
the
welcomer
they
would
be
to
the
captain
i
was
prevailed
with
by
these
hints
to
follow
the
advice
proposed
and
accordingly
besides
tea
and
a
large
hamper
of
wine
with
several
hams
and
tongues
i
caused
a
number
of
live
chickens
and
sheep
to
be
conveyed
aboard
in
truth
treble
the
quantity
of
provisions
which
would
have
supported
the
persons
i
took
with
me
had
the
voyage
continued
three
weeks
as
it
was
supposed
with
a
bare
possibility
it
might
indeed
it
continued
much
longer
but
as
this
was
occasioned
by
our
being
in
our
own
ports
it
was
by
no
means
of
any
ill
consequence
to
the
captain
as
the
additional
stores
of
fish
fresh
meat
butter
bread
which
i
constantly
laid
in
greatly
exceeded
the
consumption
and
went
some
way
in
maintaining
the
ship
crew
it
is
true
i
was
not
obliged
to
do
this
but
it
seemed
to
be
expected
for
the
captain
did
not
think
himself
obliged
to
do
it
and
i
can
truly
say
i
soon
ceased
to
expect
it
of
him
he
had
i
confess
on
board
a
number
of
fowls
and
ducks
sufficient
for
a
west
india
voyage
all
of
them
as
he
often
said
very
fine
birds
and
of
the
largest
breed
this
i
believe
was
really
the
fact
and
i
can
add
that
they
were
all
arrived
at
the
full
perfection
of
their
size
nor
was
there
i
am
convinced
any
want
of
provisions
of
a
more
substantial
kind
such
as
dried
beef
pork
and
fish
so
that
the
captain
seemed
ready
to
perform
his
contract
and
amply
to
provide
for
his
passengers
what
i
did
then
was
not
from
necessity
but
perhaps
from
a
less
excusable
motive
and
was
by
no
means
chargeable
to
the
account
of
the
captain
but
let
the
motive
have
been
what
it
would
the
consequence
was
still
the
same
and
this
was
such
that
i
am
firmly
persuaded
the
whole
pitiful
thirty
pounds
came
pure
and
neat
into
the
captain
pocket
and
not
only
so
but
attended
with
the
value
of
ten
pound
more
in
sundries
into
the
bargain
i
must
confess
myself
therefore
at
a
loss
how
the
epithet
pitiful
came
to
be
annexed
to
the
above
sum
for
not
being
a
pitiful
price
for
what
it
was
given
i
can
not
conceive
it
to
be
pitiful
in
itself
nor
do
i
believe
it
is
thought
by
the
greatest
men
in
the
kingdom
none
of
whom
would
scruple
to
search
for
it
in
the
dirtiest
kennel
where
they
had
only
a
reasonable
hope
of
success
how
therefore
such
a
sum
should
acquire
the
idea
of
pitiful
in
the
eyes
of
the
master
of
a
ship
seems
not
easy
to
be
accounted
for
since
it
appears
more
likely
to
produce
in
him
ideas
of
a
different
kind
some
men
perhaps
are
no
more
sincere
in
the
contempt
for
it
which
they
express
than
others
in
their
contempt
of
money
in
general
and
i
am
the
rather
inclined
to
this
persuasion
as
i
have
seldom
heard
of
either
who
have
refused
or
refunded
this
their
despised
object
besides
it
is
sometimes
impossible
to
believe
these
professions
as
every
action
of
the
man
life
is
a
contradiction
to
it
who
can
believe
a
tradesman
who
says
he
would
not
tell
his
name
for
the
profit
he
gets
by
the
selling
such
a
parcel
of
goods
when
he
hath
told
a
thousand
lies
in
order
to
get
it
pitiful
indeed
is
often
applied
to
an
object
not
absolutely
but
comparatively
with
our
expectations
or
with
a
greater
object
in
which
sense
it
is
not
easy
to
set
any
bounds
to
the
use
of
the
word
thus
a
handful
of
halfpence
daily
appear
pitiful
to
a
porter
and
a
handful
of
silver
to
a
drawer
the
latter
i
am
convinced
at
a
polite
tavern
will
not
tell
his
name
for
he
will
not
give
you
any
answer
under
the
price
of
gold
and
in
this
sense
thirty
pound
may
be
accounted
pitiful
by
the
lowest
mechanic
one
difficulty
only
seems
to
occur
and
that
is
this
how
comes
it
that
if
the
profits
of
the
meanest
arts
are
so
considerable
the
professors
of
them
are
not
richer
than
we
generally
see
them
one
answer
to
this
shall
suffice
men
do
not
become
rich
by
what
they
get
but
by
what
they
keep
he
who
is
worth
no
more
than
his
annual
wages
or
salary
spends
the
whole
he
will
be
always
a
beggar
let
his
income
be
what
it
will
and
so
will
be
his
family
when
he
dies
this
we
see
daily
to
be
the
case
of
ecclesiastics
who
during
their
lives
are
extremely
well
provided
for
only
because
they
desire
to
maintain
the
honor
of
the
cloth
by
living
like
gentlemen
which
would
perhaps
be
better
maintained
by
living
unlike
them
but
to
return
from
so
long
a
digression
to
which
the
use
of
so
improper
an
epithet
gave
occasion
and
to
which
the
novelty
of
the
subject
allured
i
will
make
the
reader
amends
by
concisely
telling
him
that
the
captain
poured
forth
such
a
torrent
of
abuse
that
i
very
hastily
and
very
foolishly
resolved
to
quit
the
ship
i
gave
immediate
orders
to
summon
a
hoy
to
carry
me
that
evening
to
dartmouth
without
considering
any
consequence
those
orders
i
gave
in
no
very
low
voice
so
that
those
above
stairs
might
possibly
conceive
there
was
more
than
one
master
in
the
cabin
in
the
same
tone
i
likewise
threatened
the
captain
with
that
which
he
afterwards
said
he
feared
more
than
any
rock
or
quicksand
nor
can
we
wonder
at
this
when
we
are
told
he
had
been
twice
obliged
to
bring
to
and
cast
anchor
there
before
and
had
neither
time
escaped
without
the
loss
of
almost
his
whole
cargo
the
most
distant
sound
of
law
thus
frightened
a
man
who
had
often
i
am
convinced
heard
numbers
of
cannon
roar
round
him
with
intrepidity
nor
did
he
sooner
see
the
hoy
approaching
the
vessel
than
he
ran
down
again
into
the
cabin
and
his
rage
being
perfectly
subsided
he
tumbled
on
his
knees
and
a
little
too
abjectly
implored
for
mercy
i
did
not
suffer
a
brave
man
and
an
old
man
to
remain
a
moment
in
this
posture
but
i
immediately
forgave
him
and
here
that
i
may
not
be
thought
the
sly
trumpeter
of
my
own
praises
i
do
utterly
disclaim
all
praise
on
the
occasion
neither
did
the
greatness
of
my
mind
dictate
nor
the
force
of
my
christianity
exact
this
forgiveness
to
speak
truth
i
forgave
him
from
a
motive
which
would
make
men
much
more
forgiving
if
they
were
much
wiser
than
they
are
because
it
was
convenient
for
me
so
to
do
this
morning
the
captain
dressed
himself
in
scarlet
in
order
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
devonshire
squire
to
whom
a
captain
of
a
ship
is
a
guest
of
no
ordinary
consequence
as
he
is
a
stranger
and
a
gentleman
who
hath
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
world
in
foreign
parts
and
knows
all
the
news
of
the
times
the
squire
therefore
was
to
send
his
boat
for
the
captain
but
a
most
unfortunate
accident
happened
for
as
the
wind
was
extremely
rough
and
against
the
hoy
while
this
was
endeavoring
to
avail
itself
of
great
seamanship
in
hauling
up
against
the
wind
a
sudden
squall
carried
off
sail
and
yard
or
at
least
so
disabled
them
that
they
were
no
longer
of
any
use
and
unable
to
reach
the
ship
but
the
captain
from
the
deck
saw
his
hopes
of
venison
disappointed
and
was
forced
either
to
stay
on
board
his
ship
or
to
hoist
forth
his
own
which
he
could
not
prevail
with
himself
to
think
of
though
the
smell
of
the
venison
had
had
twenty
times
its
attraction
he
did
indeed
love
his
ship
as
his
wife
and
his
boats
as
children
and
never
willingly
trusted
the
latter
poor
things
to
the
dangers
of
the
sea
to
say
truth
notwithstanding
the
strict
rigor
with
which
he
preserved
the
dignity
of
his
stations
and
the
hasty
impatience
with
which
he
resented
any
affront
to
his
person
or
orders
disobedience
to
which
he
could
in
no
instance
brook
in
any
person
on
board
he
was
one
of
the
best
natured
fellows
alive
he
acted
the
part
of
a
father
to
his
sailors
he
expressed
great
tenderness
for
any
of
them
when
ill
and
never
suffered
any
the
least
work
of
supererogation
to
go
unrewarded
by
a
glass
of
gin
he
even
extended
his
humanity
if
i
may
so
call
it
to
animals
and
even
his
cats
and
kittens
had
large
shares
in
his
affections
an
instance
of
which
we
saw
this
evening
when
the
cat
which
had
shown
it
could
not
be
drowned
was
found
suffocated
under
a
in
the
cabin
i
will
not
endeavor
to
describe
his
lamentations
with
more
prolixity
than
barely
by
saying
they
were
grievous
and
seemed
to
have
some
mixture
of
the
irish
howl
in
them
nay
he
carried
his
fondness
even
to
inanimate
objects
of
which
we
have
above
set
down
a
pregnant
example
in
his
demonstration
of
love
and
tenderness
towards
his
boats
and
ship
he
spoke
of
a
ship
which
he
had
commanded
formerly
and
which
was
long
since
no
more
which
he
had
called
the
princess
of
brazil
as
a
widower
of
a
deceased
wife
this
ship
after
having
followed
the
honest
business
of
carrying
goods
and
passengers
for
hire
many
years
did
at
last
take
to
evil
courses
and
turn
privateer
in
which
service
to
use
his
own
words
she
received
many
dreadful
wounds
which
he
himself
had
felt
as
if
they
had
been
his
own
as
the
wind
did
not
yesterday
discover
any
purpose
of
shifting
and
the
water
in
my
belly
grew
troublesome
and
rendered
me
i
began
a
second
time
to
have
apprehensions
of
wanting
the
assistance
of
a
trochar
when
none
was
to
be
found
i
therefore
concluded
to
be
tapped
again
by
way
of
precaution
and
accordingly
i
this
morning
summoned
on
board
a
surgeon
from
a
neighboring
parish
one
whom
the
captain
greatly
recommended
and
who
did
indeed
perform
his
office
with
much
dexterity
he
was
i
believe
likewise
a
man
of
great
judgment
and
knowledge
in
the
profession
but
of
this
i
can
not
speak
with
perfect
certainty
for
when
he
was
going
to
open
on
the
dropsy
at
large
and
on
the
particular
degree
of
the
distemper
under
which
i
labored
i
was
obliged
to
stop
him
short
for
the
wind
was
changed
and
the
captain
in
the
utmost
hurry
to
depart
and
to
desire
him
instead
of
his
opinion
to
assist
me
with
his
execution
i
was
now
once
more
delivered
from
my
burden
which
was
not
indeed
so
great
as
i
had
apprehended
wanting
two
quarts
of
what
was
let
out
at
the
last
operation
while
the
surgeon
was
drawing
away
my
water
the
sailors
were
drawing
up
the
anchor
both
were
finished
at
the
same
time
we
unfurled
our
sails
and
soon
passed
the
which
forms
the
mouth
of
the
bay
we
had
not
however
sailed
far
when
the
wind
which
had
though
with
a
slow
pace
kept
us
company
about
six
miles
suddenly
turned
about
and
offered
to
conduct
us
back
again
a
favor
which
though
sorely
against
the
grain
we
were
obliged
to
accept
nothing
remarkable
happened
this
day
for
as
to
the
firm
persuasion
of
the
captain
that
he
was
under
the
spell
of
witchcraft
i
would
not
repeat
it
too
often
though
indeed
he
repeated
it
an
hundred
times
every
day
in
truth
he
talked
of
nothing
else
and
seemed
not
only
to
be
satisfied
in
general
of
his
being
bewitched
but
actually
to
have
fixed
with
good
certainty
on
the
person
of
the
witch
whom
had
he
lived
in
the
days
of
sir
matthew
hale
he
would
have
infallibly
indicted
and
very
possibly
have
hanged
for
the
detestable
sin
of
witchcraft
but
that
law
and
the
whole
doctrine
that
supported
it
are
now
out
of
fashion
and
witches
as
a
learned
divine
once
chose
to
express
himself
are
put
down
by
act
of
parliament
this
witch
in
the
captain
opinion
was
no
other
than
francis
of
ryde
who
as
he
insinuated
out
of
anger
to
me
for
not
spending
more
money
in
her
house
than
she
could
produce
anything
to
exchange
for
or
ally
pretense
to
charge
for
had
laid
this
spell
on
his
ship
though
we
were
again
got
near
our
harbor
by
three
in
the
afternoon
yet
it
seemed
to
require
a
full
hour
or
more
before
we
could
come
to
our
former
place
of
anchoring
or
berth
as
the
captain
called
it
on
this
occasion
we
exemplified
one
of
the
few
advantages
which
the
travelers
by
water
have
over
the
travelers
by
land
what
would
the
latter
often
give
for
the
sight
of
one
of
those
hospitable
mansions
where
he
is
assured
that
there
is
good
entertainment
for
man
and
horse
and
where
both
may
consequently
promise
themselves
to
assuage
that
hunger
which
exercise
is
so
sure
to
raise
in
a
healthy
constitution
at
their
arrival
at
this
mansion
how
much
happier
is
the
state
of
the
horse
than
that
of
the
master
the
former
is
immediately
led
to
his
repast
such
as
it
is
and
whatever
it
is
he
falls
to
it
with
appetite
but
the
latter
is
in
a
much
worse
situation
his
hunger
however
violent
is
always
in
some
degree
delicate
and
his
food
must
have
some
kind
of
ornament
or
as
the
more
usual
phrase
is
of
dressing
to
recommend
it
now
all
dressing
requires
time
and
therefore
though
perhaps
the
sheep
might
be
just
killed
before
you
came
to
the
inn
yet
in
cutting
him
up
fetching
the
joint
which
the
landlord
by
mistake
said
he
had
in
the
house
from
the
butcher
at
two
miles
distance
and
afterwards
warming
it
a
little
by
the
fire
two
hours
at
least
must
be
consumed
while
hunger
for
want
of
better
food
preys
all
the
time
on
the
vitals
of
the
man
how
different
was
the
case
with
us
we
carried
our
provision
our
kitchen
and
our
cook
with
us
and
we
were
at
one
and
the
same
time
traveling
on
our
road
and
sitting
down
to
a
repast
of
fish
with
which
the
greatest
table
in
london
can
scarce
at
any
rate
be
supplied
as
we
were
disappointed
of
our
wind
and
obliged
to
return
back
the
preceding
evening
we
resolved
to
extract
all
the
good
we
could
out
of
our
misfortune
and
to
add
considerably
to
our
fresh
stores
of
meat
and
bread
with
which
we
were
very
indifferently
provided
when
we
hurried
away
yesterday
by
the
captain
advice
we
likewise
laid
in
some
stores
of
butter
which
we
salted
and
potted
ourselves
for
our
use
at
lisbon
and
we
had
great
reason
afterwards
to
thank
him
for
his
advice
in
the
afternoon
i
persuaded
my
wife
whom
it
was
no
easy
matter
for
me
to
force
from
my
side
to
take
a
walk
on
shore
whither
the
gallant
captain
declared
he
was
ready
to
attend
her
accordingly
the
ladies
set
out
and
left
me
to
enjoy
a
sweet
and
comfortable
nap
after
the
operation
of
the
preceding
day
thus
we
enjoyed
our
separate
pleasures
full
three
hours
when
we
met
again
and
my
wife
gave
the
foregoing
account
of
the
gentleman
whom
i
have
before
compared
to
axylus
and
of
his
habitation
to
both
which
she
had
been
introduced
by
the
captain
in
the
style
of
an
old
friend
and
acquaintance
though
this
foundation
of
intimacy
seemed
to
her
to
be
no
deeper
laid
than
in
an
accidental
dinner
eaten
many
years
before
at
this
temple
of
hospitality
when
the
captain
lay
in
the
same
bay
early
this
morning
the
wind
seemed
inclined
to
change
in
our
favor
our
alert
captain
snatched
its
very
first
motion
and
got
under
sail
with
so
very
gentle
a
breeze
that
as
the
tide
was
against
him
he
recommended
to
a
fishing
boy
to
bring
after
him
a
vast
salmon
and
some
other
provisions
which
lay
ready
for
him
on
shore
our
anchor
was
up
at
six
and
before
nine
in
the
morning
we
had
doubled
the
and
were
arrived
off
dartmouth
having
gone
full
three
miles
in
as
many
hours
in
direct
opposition
to
the
tide
which
only
befriended
us
out
of
our
harbor
and
though
the
wind
was
perhaps
our
friend
it
was
so
very
silent
and
exerted
itself
so
little
in
our
favor
that
like
some
cool
partisans
it
was
difficult
to
say
whether
it
was
with
us
or
against
us
the
captain
however
declared
the
former
to
be
the
case
during
the
whole
three
hours
but
at
last
he
perceived
his
error
or
rather
perhaps
this
friend
which
had
hitherto
wavered
in
choosing
his
side
became
now
more
determined
the
captain
then
suddenly
tacked
about
and
asserting
that
he
was
bewitched
submitted
to
return
to
the
place
from
whence
he
came
now
though
i
am
as
free
from
superstition
as
any
man
breathing
and
never
did
believe
in
witches
notwithstanding
all
the
excellent
arguments
of
my
lord
hale
in
their
favor
and
long
before
they
were
put
down
by
act
of
parliament
yet
by
what
power
a
ship
of
burden
should
sail
three
miles
against
both
wind
and
tide
i
can
not
conceive
unless
there
was
some
supernatural
interposition
in
the
case
nay
could
we
admit
that
the
wind
stood
neuter
the
difficulty
would
still
remain
so
that
we
must
of
necessity
conclude
that
the
ship
was
either
bewinded
or
bewitched
the
captain
perhaps
had
another
meaning
he
imagined
himself
i
believe
bewitched
because
the
wind
instead
of
persevering
in
its
change
in
his
favor
for
change
it
certainly
did
that
morning
should
suddenly
return
to
its
favorite
station
and
blow
him
back
towards
the
bay
but
if
this
was
his
opinion
he
soon
saw
cause
to
alter
for
he
had
not
measured
half
the
way
back
when
the
wind
again
declared
in
his
favor
and
so
loudly
that
there
was
no
possibility
of
being
mistaken
the
orders
for
the
second
tack
were
given
and
obeyed
with
much
more
alacrity
than
those
had
been
for
the
first
we
were
all
of
us
indeed
in
high
spirits
on
the
occasion
though
some
of
us
a
little
regretted
the
good
things
we
were
likely
to
leave
behind
us
by
the
fisherman
neglect
i
might
give
it
a
worse
name
for
he
faithfully
promised
to
execute
the
commission
which
he
had
had
abundant
opportunity
to
do
but
nautica
fides
deserves
as
much
to
be
proverbial
as
ever
punica
fides
could
formerly
have
done
nay
when
we
consider
that
the
carthaginians
came
from
the
phoenicians
who
are
supposed
to
have
produced
the
first
mariners
we
may
probably
see
the
true
reason
of
the
adage
and
it
may
open
a
field
of
very
curious
discoveries
to
the
antiquarian
we
were
however
too
eager
to
pursue
our
voyage
to
suffer
anything
we
left
behind
us
to
interrupt
our
happiness
which
indeed
many
agreeable
circumstances
conspired
to
advance
the
weather
was
inexpressibly
pleasant
and
we
were
all
seated
on
the
deck
when
our
canvas
began
to
swell
with
the
wind
we
had
likewise
in
our
view
above
thirty
other
sail
around
us
all
in
the
same
situation
here
an
observation
occurred
to
me
which
perhaps
though
extremely
obvious
did
not
offer
itself
to
every
individual
in
our
little
fleet
when
i
perceived
with
what
different
success
we
proceeded
under
the
influence
of
a
superior
power
which
while
we
lay
almost
idle
ourselves
pushed
us
forward
on
our
intended
voyage
and
compared
this
with
the
slow
progress
which
we
had
made
in
the
morning
of
ourselves
and
without
any
such
assistance
i
could
not
help
reflecting
how
often
the
greatest
abilities
lie
as
it
were
in
life
or
if
they
venture
out
and
attempt
to
beat
the
seas
they
struggle
in
vain
against
wind
and
tide
and
if
they
have
not
sufficient
prudence
to
put
back
are
most
probably
cast
away
on
the
rocks
and
quicksands
which
are
every
day
ready
to
devour
them
it
was
now
our
fortune
to
set
out
melioribus
avibus
the
wind
freshened
so
briskly
in
our
poop
that
the
shore
appeared
to
move
from
us
as
fast
as
we
did
from
the
shore
the
captain
declared
he
was
sure
of
a
wind
meaning
its
continuance
but
he
had
disappointed
us
so
often
that
he
had
lost
all
credit
however
he
kept
his
word
a
little
better
now
and
we
lost
sight
of
our
native
land
as
joyfully
at
least
as
it
is
usual
to
regain
it
the
next
morning
the
captain
told
me
he
thought
himself
thirty
miles
to
the
westward
of
plymouth
and
before
evening
declared
that
the
lizard
point
which
is
the
extremity
of
cornwall
bore
several
leagues
to
leeward
nothing
remarkable
passed
this
day
except
the
devotion
who
in
his
own
phrase
summoned
all
hands
to
prayers
which
were
read
by
a
common
sailor
upon
deck
with
more
devout
force
and
address
than
they
are
commonly
read
by
a
country
curate
and
received
with
more
decency
and
attention
by
the
sailors
than
are
usually
preserved
in
city
congregations
i
am
indeed
assured
that
if
any
such
affected
disregard
of
the
solemn
office
in
which
they
were
engaged
as
i
have
seen
practiced
by
fine
gentlemen
and
ladies
expressing
a
kind
of
apprehension
lest
they
should
be
suspected
of
being
really
in
earnest
in
their
devotion
had
been
shown
here
they
would
have
contracted
the
contempt
of
the
whole
audience
to
say
the
truth
from
what
i
observed
in
the
behavior
of
the
sailors
in
this
voyage
and
on
comparing
it
with
what
i
have
formerly
seen
of
them
at
sea
and
on
shore
i
am
convinced
that
on
land
there
is
nothing
more
idle
and
dissolute
in
their
own
element
there
are
no
persons
near
the
level
of
their
degree
who
live
in
the
constant
practice
of
half
so
many
good
qualities
they
are
for
much
the
greater
part
perfect
masters
of
their
business
and
always
extremely
alert
and
ready
in
executing
it
without
any
regard
to
fatigue
or
hazard
the
soldiers
themselves
are
not
better
disciplined
nor
more
obedient
to
orders
than
these
whilst
aboard
they
submit
to
every
difficulty
which
attends
their
calling
with
cheerfulness
and
no
less
virtues
and
patience
and
fortitude
are
exercised
by
them
every
day
of
their
lives
all
these
good
qualities
however
they
always
leave
behind
them
on
shipboard
the
sailor
out
of
water
is
indeed
as
wretched
an
animal
as
the
fish
out
of
water
for
though
the
former
hath
in
common
with
amphibious
animals
the
bare
power
of
existing
on
the
land
yet
if
he
be
kept
there
any
time
he
never
fails
to
become
a
nuisance
the
ship
having
had
a
good
deal
of
motion
since
she
was
last
under
sail
our
women
returned
to
their
sickness
and
i
to
my
solitude
having
for
hours
together
scarce
opened
my
lips
to
a
single
person
this
circumstance
of
being
shut
up
within
the
circumference
of
a
few
yards
with
a
score
of
human
creatures
with
not
one
of
whom
it
was
possible
to
converse
was
perhaps
so
rare
as
scarce
ever
to
have
happened
before
nor
could
it
ever
happen
to
one
who
disliked
it
more
than
myself
or
to
myself
at
a
season
when
i
wanted
more
food
for
my
social
disposition
or
could
converse
less
wholesomely
and
happily
with
my
own
thoughts
to
this
accident
which
fortune
opened
to
me
in
the
downs
was
owing
the
first
serious
thought
which
i
ever
entertained
of
enrolling
myself
among
the
some
of
the
most
amusing
pages
if
indeed
there
be
any
which
deserve
that
name
were
possibly
the
production
of
the
most
disagreeable
hours
which
ever
haunted
the
author
at
noon
the
captain
took
an
observation
by
which
it
appeared
that
ushant
bore
some
leagues
northward
of
us
and
that
we
were
just
entering
the
bay
of
biscay
we
had
advanced
a
very
few
miles
in
this
bay
before
we
were
entirely
becalmed
we
furled
our
sails
as
being
of
no
use
to
us
while
we
lay
in
this
most
disagreeable
situation
more
detested
by
the
sailors
than
the
most
violent
tempest
we
were
alarmed
with
the
loss
of
a
fine
piece
of
salt
beef
which
had
been
hung
in
the
sea
to
freshen
it
this
being
it
seems
the
strange
property
of
the
thief
was
immediately
suspected
and
presently
afterwards
taken
by
the
sailors
he
was
indeed
no
other
than
a
huge
shark
who
not
knowing
when
he
was
well
off
swallowed
another
piece
of
beef
together
with
a
great
iron
crook
on
which
it
was
hung
and
by
which
he
was
dragged
into
the
ship
i
should
scarce
have
mentioned
the
catching
this
shark
though
so
exactly
conformable
to
the
rules
and
practice
of
had
it
not
been
for
a
strange
circumstance
that
attended
it
this
was
the
recovery
of
the
stolen
beef
out
of
the
shark
maw
where
it
lay
unchewed
and
undigested
and
whence
being
conveyed
into
the
pot
the
flesh
and
the
thief
that
had
stolen
it
joined
together
in
furnishing
variety
to
the
ship
crew
during
this
calm
we
likewise
found
the
mast
of
a
large
vessel
which
the
captain
thought
had
lain
at
least
three
years
in
the
sea
it
was
stuck
all
over
with
a
little
or
reptile
called
a
barnacle
and
which
probably
are
the
prey
of
the
rockfish
as
our
captain
calls
it
asserting
that
it
is
the
finest
fish
in
the
world
for
which
we
are
obliged
to
confide
entirely
to
his
taste
for
though
he
struck
the
fish
with
a
kind
of
and
wounded
him
i
am
convinced
to
death
yet
he
could
not
possess
himself
of
his
body
but
the
poor
wretch
escaped
to
linger
out
a
few
hours
with
probably
great
torments
in
the
evening
our
wind
returned
and
so
briskly
that
we
ran
upwards
of
twenty
leagues
before
the
next
day
tuesday
observation
which
brought
us
to
lat
degrees
the
captain
promised
us
a
very
speedy
passage
through
the
bay
but
he
deceived
us
or
the
wind
deceived
him
for
it
so
slackened
at
sunset
that
it
scarce
carried
us
a
mile
in
an
hour
during
the
whole
succeeding
night
a
gale
struck
up
a
little
after
sunrising
which
carried
us
between
three
and
four
knots
or
miles
an
hour
we
were
this
day
at
noon
about
the
middle
of
the
bay
of
biscay
when
the
wind
once
more
deserted
us
and
we
were
so
entirely
becalmed
that
we
did
not
advance
a
mile
in
many
hours
my
reader
will
perhaps
conceive
no
unpleasant
idea
from
this
calm
but
it
affected
us
much
more
than
a
storm
could
have
done
for
as
the
irascible
passions
of
men
are
apt
to
swell
with
indignation
long
after
the
injury
which
first
raised
them
is
over
so
fared
it
with
the
sea
it
rose
mountains
high
and
lifted
our
poor
ship
up
and
down
backwards
and
forwards
with
so
violent
an
emotion
that
there
was
scarce
a
man
in
the
ship
better
able
to
stand
than
myself
every
utensil
in
our
cabin
rolled
up
and
down
as
we
should
have
rolled
ourselves
had
not
our
chairs
been
fast
lashed
to
the
floor
in
this
situation
with
our
tables
likewise
fastened
by
ropes
the
captain
and
myself
took
our
meal
with
some
difficulty
and
swallowed
a
little
of
our
broth
for
we
spilt
much
the
greater
part
the
remainder
of
our
dinner
being
an
old
lean
tame
duck
roasted
i
regretted
but
little
the
loss
of
my
teeth
not
being
good
enough
to
have
chewed
it
our
women
who
began
to
creep
out
of
their
holes
in
the
morning
retired
again
within
the
cabin
to
their
beds
and
were
no
more
heard
of
this
day
in
which
my
whole
comfort
was
to
find
by
the
captain
relation
that
the
swelling
was
sometimes
much
worse
he
did
indeed
take
this
occasion
to
be
more
communicative
than
ever
and
informed
me
of
such
misadventures
that
had
befallen
him
within
years
at
sea
as
might
frighten
a
very
bold
spirit
from
undertaking
even
the
shortest
voyage
were
these
indeed
but
universally
known
our
matrons
of
quality
would
possibly
be
deterred
from
venturing
their
tender
offspring
at
sea
by
which
means
our
navy
would
lose
the
honor
of
many
a
young
commodore
who
at
is
better
versed
in
maritime
affairs
than
real
seamen
are
made
by
experience
at
sixty
and
this
may
perhaps
appear
the
more
extraordinary
as
the
education
of
both
seems
to
be
pretty
much
the
same
neither
of
them
having
had
their
courage
tried
by
virgil
description
of
a
storm
in
which
inspired
as
he
was
i
doubt
whether
our
captain
doth
not
exceed
him
in
the
evening
the
wind
which
continued
in
the
again
freshened
and
that
so
briskly
that
cape
finisterre
appeared
by
this
day
observation
to
bear
a
few
miles
to
the
southward
we
now
indeed
sailed
or
rather
flew
near
ten
knots
an
hour
and
the
captain
in
the
redundancy
of
his
declared
he
would
go
to
church
at
lisbon
on
sunday
next
for
that
he
was
sure
of
a
wind
and
indeed
we
all
firmly
believed
him
but
the
event
again
contradicted
him
for
we
were
again
visited
by
a
calm
in
the
evening
but
here
though
our
voyage
was
retarded
we
were
entertained
with
a
scene
which
as
no
one
can
behold
without
going
to
sea
so
no
one
can
form
an
idea
of
anything
equal
to
it
on
shore
we
were
seated
on
the
deck
women
and
all
in
the
serenest
evening
that
can
be
imagined
not
a
single
cloud
presented
itself
to
our
view
and
the
sun
himself
was
the
only
object
which
engrossed
our
whole
attention
he
did
indeed
set
with
a
majesty
which
is
incapable
of
description
with
which
while
the
horizon
was
yet
blazing
with
glory
our
eyes
were
called
off
to
the
opposite
part
to
survey
the
moon
which
was
then
at
full
and
which
in
rising
presented
us
with
the
second
object
that
this
world
hath
offered
to
our
vision
compared
to
these
the
pageantry
of
theaters
or
splendor
of
courts
are
sights
almost
below
the
regard
of
children
we
did
not
return
from
the
deck
till
late
in
the
evening
the
weather
being
inexpressibly
pleasant
and
so
warm
that
even
my
old
distemper
perceived
the
alteration
of
the
climate
there
was
indeed
a
swell
but
nothing
comparable
to
what
we
had
felt
before
and
it
affected
us
on
the
deck
much
less
than
in
the
cabin
the
calm
continued
till
when
the
wind
likewise
arose
but
unluckily
for
us
it
came
from
a
wrong
quarter
it
was
which
is
that
very
wind
which
juno
would
have
solicited
of
aeolus
had
gneas
been
in
our
latitude
bound
for
lisbon
the
captain
now
put
on
his
most
melancholy
aspect
and
resumed
his
former
opinion
that
he
was
bewitched
he
declared
with
great
solemnity
that
this
was
worse
and
worse
for
that
a
wind
directly
in
his
teeth
was
worse
than
no
wind
at
all
had
we
pursued
the
course
which
the
wind
persuaded
us
to
take
we
had
gone
directly
for
newfoundland
if
we
had
not
fallen
in
with
ireland
in
our
way
two
ways
remained
to
avoid
this
one
was
to
put
into
a
port
of
galicia
the
other
to
beat
to
the
westward
with
as
little
sail
as
possible
and
this
was
our
election
as
for
us
poor
passengers
any
port
would
have
been
welcome
to
us
especially
as
not
only
our
fresh
provisions
except
a
great
number
of
old
ducks
and
fowls
but
even
our
bread
was
come
to
an
end
and
nothing
but
remained
which
i
could
not
chew
so
that
now
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
saw
what
it
was
to
want
a
bit
of
bread
the
wind
however
was
not
so
unkind
as
we
had
apprehended
but
having
declined
with
the
sun
it
changed
at
the
approach
of
the
moon
and
became
again
favorable
to
us
though
so
gentle
that
the
next
observation
carried
us
very
little
to
the
southward
of
cape
finisterre
this
evening
at
six
the
wind
which
had
been
very
quiet
all
day
rose
very
high
and
continuing
in
our
favor
drove
us
seven
knots
an
hour
this
day
we
saw
a
sail
the
only
one
as
i
heard
of
we
had
seen
in
our
whole
passage
through
the
bay
i
mention
this
on
account
of
what
appeared
to
me
somewhat
extraordinary
though
she
was
at
such
a
distance
that
i
could
only
perceive
she
was
a
ship
the
sailors
discovered
that
she
was
a
snow
bound
to
a
port
in
galicia
after
prayers
which
our
good
captain
read
on
the
deck
with
an
audible
voice
and
with
but
one
mistake
of
a
lion
for
elias
in
the
second
lesson
for
this
day
we
found
ourselves
far
advanced
in
degrees
and
the
captain
declared
we
should
sup
off
porte
we
had
not
much
wind
this
day
but
as
this
was
directly
in
our
favor
we
made
it
up
with
sail
of
which
we
crowded
all
we
had
we
went
only
at
the
rate
of
four
miles
an
hour
but
with
so
uneasy
a
motion
continuing
rolling
from
side
to
side
that
i
suffered
more
than
i
had
done
in
our
whole
voyage
my
bowels
being
almost
twisted
out
of
my
belly
however
the
day
was
very
serene
and
bright
and
the
captain
who
was
in
high
spirits
affirmed
he
had
never
passed
a
pleasanter
at
sea
the
wind
continued
so
brisk
that
we
ran
upward
of
six
knots
an
hour
the
whole
night
in
the
morning
our
captain
concluded
that
he
was
got
into
lat
degrees
and
was
very
little
short
of
the
burlings
as
they
are
called
in
the
charts
we
came
up
with
them
at
five
in
the
afternoon
being
the
first
land
we
had
distinctly
seen
since
we
left
devonshire
they
consist
of
abundance
of
little
rocky
islands
a
little
distant
from
the
shore
three
of
them
only
showing
themselves
above
the
water
here
the
portuguese
maintain
a
kind
of
garrison
if
we
may
allow
it
that
name
it
consists
of
malefactors
who
are
banished
hither
for
a
term
for
divers
small
offenses
a
policy
which
they
may
have
copied
from
the
egyptians
as
we
may
read
in
diodorus
siculus
that
wise
people
to
prevent
the
corruption
of
good
manners
by
evil
communication
built
a
town
on
the
red
sea
whither
they
transported
a
great
number
of
their
criminals
having
first
set
an
indelible
mark
on
them
to
prevent
their
returning
and
mixing
with
the
sober
part
of
their
citizens
these
rocks
lie
about
fifteen
leagues
northwest
of
cape
roxent
or
as
it
is
commonly
called
the
rock
of
lisbon
which
we
passed
early
the
next
morning
the
wind
indeed
would
have
carried
us
thither
sooner
but
the
captain
was
not
in
a
hurry
as
he
was
to
lose
nothing
by
his
delay
this
is
a
very
high
mountain
situated
on
the
northern
side
of
the
mouth
of
the
river
tajo
which
rising
about
madrid
in
spain
and
soon
becoming
navigable
for
small
craft
empties
itself
after
a
long
course
into
the
sea
about
four
leagues
below
lisbon
on
the
summit
of
the
rock
stands
a
hermitage
which
is
now
in
the
possession
of
an
englishman
who
was
formerly
master
of
a
vessel
trading
to
lisbon
and
having
changed
his
religion
and
his
manners
the
latter
of
which
at
least
were
none
of
the
best
betook
himself
to
this
place
in
order
to
do
penance
for
his
sins
he
is
now
very
old
and
hath
inhabited
this
hermitage
for
a
great
number
of
years
during
which
he
hath
received
some
countenance
from
the
royal
family
and
particularly
from
the
present
queen
dowager
whose
piety
refuses
no
trouble
or
expense
by
which
she
may
make
a
proselyte
being
used
to
say
that
the
saving
one
soul
would
repay
all
the
endeavors
of
her
life
here
we
waited
for
the
tide
and
had
the
pleasure
of
surveying
the
face
of
the
country
the
soil
of
which
at
this
season
exactly
resembles
an
old
or
a
field
where
the
green
sward
is
pared
up
and
set
or
rather
a
smoking
in
little
heaps
to
manure
the
land
this
sight
will
perhaps
of
all
others
make
an
englishman
proud
of
and
pleased
with
his
own
country
which
in
verdure
excels
i
believe
every
other
country
another
deficiency
here
is
the
want
of
large
trees
nothing
above
a
shrub
being
here
to
be
discovered
in
the
circumference
of
many
miles
at
this
place
we
took
a
pilot
on
board
who
being
the
first
portuguese
we
spoke
to
gave
us
an
instance
of
that
religious
observance
which
is
paid
by
all
nations
to
their
laws
for
whereas
it
is
here
a
capital
offense
to
assist
any
person
in
going
on
shore
from
a
foreign
vessel
before
it
hath
been
examined
and
every
person
in
it
viewed
by
the
magistrates
of
health
as
they
are
called
this
worthy
pilot
for
a
very
small
reward
rowed
the
portuguese
priest
to
shore
at
this
place
beyond
which
he
did
not
dare
to
advance
and
in
venturing
whither
he
had
given
sufficient
testimony
of
love
for
his
native
country
we
did
not
enter
the
tajo
till
noon
when
after
passing
several
old
castles
and
other
buildings
which
had
greatly
the
aspect
of
ruins
we
came
to
the
castle
of
bellisle
where
we
had
a
full
prospect
of
lisbon
and
were
indeed
within
three
miles
of
it
here
we
were
saluted
with
a
gun
which
was
a
signal
to
pass
no
farther
till
we
had
complied
with
certain
ceremonies
which
the
laws
of
this
country
require
to
be
observed
by
all
ships
which
arrive
in
this
port
we
were
obliged
then
to
cast
anchor
and
expect
the
arrival
of
the
officers
of
the
customs
without
whose
passport
no
ship
must
proceed
farther
than
this
place
here
likewise
we
received
a
visit
from
one
of
those
magistrates
of
health
before
mentioned
he
refused
to
come
on
board
the
ship
till
every
person
in
her
had
been
drawn
up
on
deck
and
personally
viewed
by
him
this
occasioned
some
delay
on
my
part
as
it
was
not
the
work
of
a
minute
to
lift
me
from
the
cabin
to
the
deck
the
captain
thought
my
particular
case
might
have
been
excused
from
this
ceremony
and
that
it
would
be
abundantly
sufficient
if
the
magistrate
who
was
obliged
afterwards
to
visit
the
cabin
surveyed
me
there
but
this
did
not
satisfy
the
magistrate
strict
regard
to
his
duty
when
he
was
told
of
my
lameness
he
called
out
with
a
voice
of
authority
let
him
be
brought
up
and
his
orders
were
presently
complied
with
he
was
indeed
a
person
of
great
dignity
as
well
as
of
the
most
exact
fidelity
in
the
discharge
of
his
trust
both
which
are
the
more
admirable
as
his
salary
is
less
than
thirty
pounds
english
per
annum
before
a
ship
hath
been
visited
by
one
of
those
magistrates
no
person
can
lawfully
go
on
board
her
nor
can
any
on
board
depart
from
her
this
i
saw
exemplified
in
a
remarkable
instance
the
young
lad
whom
i
have
mentioned
as
one
of
our
passengers
was
here
met
by
his
father
who
on
the
first
news
of
the
captain
arrival
came
from
lisbon
to
bellisle
in
a
boat
being
eager
to
embrace
a
son
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
many
years
but
when
he
came
alongside
our
ship
neither
did
the
father
dare
ascend
nor
the
son
descend
as
the
magistrate
of
health
had
not
yet
been
on
board
some
of
our
readers
will
perhaps
admire
the
great
caution
of
this
policy
so
nicely
calculated
for
the
preservation
of
this
country
from
all
pestilential
distempers
others
will
as
probably
regard
it
as
too
exact
and
formal
to
be
constantly
persisted
in
in
seasons
of
the
utmost
safety
as
well
as
in
times
of
danger
i
will
not
decide
either
way
but
will
content
myself
with
observing
that
i
never
yet
saw
or
heard
of
a
place
where
a
traveler
had
so
much
trouble
given
him
at
his
landing
as
here
the
only
use
of
which
as
all
such
matters
begin
and
end
in
form
only
is
to
put
it
into
the
power
of
low
and
mean
fellows
to
be
either
rudely
officious
or
grossly
corrupt
as
they
shall
see
occasion
to
prefer
the
gratification
of
their
pride
or
of
their
avarice
of
this
kind
likewise
is
that
power
which
is
lodged
with
other
officers
here
of
taking
away
every
grain
of
snuff
and
every
leaf
of
tobacco
brought
hither
from
other
countries
though
only
for
the
temporary
use
of
the
person
during
his
residence
here
this
is
executed
with
great
insolence
and
as
it
is
in
the
hands
of
the
dregs
of
the
people
very
scandalously
for
under
pretense
of
searching
for
tobacco
and
snuff
they
are
sure
to
steal
whatever
they
can
find
insomuch
that
when
they
came
on
board
our
sailors
addressed
us
in
the
language
pray
gentlemen
and
ladies
take
care
of
your
swords
and
watches
indeed
i
never
yet
saw
anything
equal
to
the
contempt
and
hatred
which
our
honest
tars
every
moment
expressed
for
these
portuguese
officers
at
bellisle
lies
buried
catharine
of
arragon
widow
of
prince
arthur
eldest
son
of

afterwards

to
and
divorced

viii
close
by
the
church
where
her
remains
are
deposited
is
a
large
convent
of
geronymites
one
of
the
most
beautiful
piles
of
building
in
all
portugal
in
the
evening
at
twelve
our
ship
having
received
previous
visits
from
all
the
necessary
parties
took
the
advantage
of
the
tide
and
having
sailed
up
to
lisbon
cast
anchor
there
in
a
calm
and
moonshiny
night
which
made
the
passage
incredibly
pleasant
to
the
women
who
remained
three
hours
enjoying
it
whilst
i
was
left
to
the
cooler
transports
of
enjoying
their
pleasures
at
and
yet
cooler
as
they
may
be
whoever
is
totally
ignorant
of
such
sensation
is
at
the
same
time
void
of
all
ideas
of
friendship
lisbon
before
which
we
now
lay
at
anchor
is
said
to
be
built
on
the
same
number
of
hills
with
old
rome
but
these
do
not
all
appear
to
the
water
on
the
contrary
one
sees
from
thence
one
vast
high
hill
and
rock
with
buildings
arising
above
one
another
and
that
in
so
steep
and
almost
perpendicular
a
manner
that
they
all
seem
to
have
but
one
foundation
as
the
houses
convents
churches
are
large
and
all
built
with
white
stone
they
look
very
beautiful
at
a
distance
but
as
you
approach
nearer
and
find
them
to
want
every
kind
of
ornament
all
idea
of
beauty
vanishes
at
once
while
i
was
surveying
the
prospect
of
this
city
which
bears
so
little
resemblance
to
any
other
that
i
have
ever
seen
a
reflection
occurred
to
me
that
if
a
man
was
suddenly
to
be
removed
from
palmyra
hither
and
should
take
a
view
of
no
other
city
in
how
glorious
a
light
would
the
ancient
architecture
appear
to
him
and
what
desolation
and
destruction
of
arts
and
sciences
would
he
conclude
had
happened
between
the
several
eras
of
these
cities
i
had
now
waited
full
three
hours
upon
deck
for
the
return
of
my
man
whom
i
had
sent
to
bespeak
a
good
dinner
a
thing
which
had
been
long
unknown
to
me
on
shore
and
then
to
bring
a
lisbon
chaise
with
him
to
the
seashore
but
it
seems
the
impertinence
of
the
providore
was
not
yet
brought
to
a
conclusion
at
three
when
i
was
from
emptiness
rather
faint
than
hungry
my
man
returned
and
told
me
there
was
a
new
law
lately
made
that
no
passenger
should
set
his
foot
on
shore
without
a
special
order
from
the
providore
and
that
he
himself
would
have
been
sent
to
prison
for
disobeying
it
had
he
not
been
protected
as
the
servant
of
the
captain
he
informed
me
likewise
that
the
captain
had
been
very
industrious
to
get
this
order
but
that
it
was
then
the
providore
hour
of
sleep
a
time
when
no
man
except
the
king
himself
durst
disturb
him
to
avoid
prolixity
though
in
a
part
of
my
narrative
which
may
be
more
agreeable
to
my
reader
than
it
was
to
me
the
providore
having
at
last
finished
his
nap
dispatched
this
absurd
matter
of
form
and
gave
me
leave
to
come
or
rather
to
be
carried
on
shore
what
it
was
that
gave
the
first
hint
of
this
strange
law
is
not
easy
to
guess
possibly
in
the
infancy
of
their
defection
and
before
their
government
could
be
well
established
they
were
willing
to
guard
against
the
bare
possibility
of
surprise
of
the
success
of
which
bare
possibility
the
trojan
horse
will
remain
for
ever
on
record
as
a
great
and
memorable
example
now
the
portuguese
have
no
walls
to
secure
them
and
a
vessel
of
two
or
three
hundred
tons
will
contain
a
much
larger
body
of
troops
than
could
be
concealed
in
that
famous
machine
though
virgil
tells
us
somewhat
hyperbolically
i
believe
that
it
was
as
big
as
a
mountain
about
seven
in
the
evening
i
got
into
a
chaise
on
shore
and
was
driven
through
the
nastiest
city
in
the
world
though
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
populous
to
a
kind
of
which
is
very
pleasantly
situated
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
about
a
mile
from
the
city
and
hath
a
very
fine
prospect
of
the
river
tajo
from
lisbon
to
the
sea
here
we
regaled
ourselves
with
a
good
supper
for
which
we
were
as
well
charged
as
if
the
bill
had
been
made
on
the
between
newbury
and
london
and
now
we
could
joyfully
say
egressi
optata
troes
potiuntur
arena
therefore
in
the
words
of
horace
hie
finis
chartaeque
viaeque
