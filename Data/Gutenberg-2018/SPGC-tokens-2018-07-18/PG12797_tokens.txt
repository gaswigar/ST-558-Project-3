i
up
the
trail
just
why
my
father
moved
at
the
close
of
the
civil
war
from
georgia
to
texas
is
to
this
good
hour
a
mystery
to
me
while
we
did
not
exactly
belong
to
the
poor
whites
we
classed
with
them
in
poverty
being
renters
but
i
am
inclined
to
think
my
parents
were
intellectually
superior
to
that
common
type
of
the
south
both
were
foreign
born
my
mother
being
scotch
and
my
father
a
north
of
ireland
man
as
i
remember
him
now
impulsive
hasty
in
action
and
slow
to
confess
a
fault
it
was
his
impulsiveness
that
led
him
to
volunteer
and
serve
four
years
in
the
confederate
army
trying
years
to
my
mother
with
a
brood
of
seven
children
to
feed
garb
and
house
the
war
brought
me
my
initiation
as
a
cowboy
of
which
i
have
now
after
the
long
lapse
of
years
the
greater
portion
of
which
were
spent
with
cattle
a
distinct
recollection
sherman
army
in
its
march
to
the
sea
passed
through
our
county
devastating
that
section
for
miles
in
its
passing
foraging
parties
scoured
the
country
on
either
side
of
its
path
my
mother
had
warning
in
time
and
set
her
house
in
order
our
work
stock
consisted
of
two
yoke
of
oxen
while
our
cattle
numbered
three
cows
and
for
saving
them
from
the
foragers
credit
must
be
given
to
my
mother
generalship
there
was
a
wild
canebrake
in
which
the
cattle
fed
several
hundred
acres
in
extent
about
a
mile
from
our
little
farm
and
it
was
necessary
to
bell
them
in
order
to
locate
them
when
wanted
but
the
cows
were
in
the
habit
of
coming
up
to
be
milked
and
a
soldier
can
hear
a
bell
as
well
as
any
one
i
was
a
lad
of
eight
at
the
time
and
while
my
two
older
brothers
worked
our
few
fields
i
was
sent
into
the
canebrake
to
herd
the
cattle
we
had
removed
the
bells
from
the
oxen
and
cows
but
one
ox
was
belled
after
darkness
each
evening
to
be
unbelled
again
at
daybreak
i
always
carried
the
bell
with
me
stuffed
with
grass
in
order
to
have
it
at
hand
when
wanted
during
the
first
few
days
of
the
raid
a
number
of
mounted
foraging
parties
passed
our
house
but
its
poverty
was
all
too
apparent
and
nothing
was
molested
several
of
these
parties
were
driving
herds
of
cattle
and
work
stock
of
every
description
while
by
day
and
by
night
gins
and
plantation
houses
were
being
given
to
the
flames
our
log
cabin
was
spared
due
to
the
ingenious
tale
told
by
my
mother
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
my
father
and
yet
she
taught
her
children
to
fear
god
and
tell
the
truth
my
vigil
was
trying
to
one
of
my
years
for
the
days
seemed
like
weeks
but
the
importance
of
hiding
our
cattle
was
thoroughly
impressed
upon
my
mind
food
was
secretly
brought
to
me
and
under
cover
of
darkness
my
mother
and
eldest
brother
would
come
and
milk
the
cows
when
we
would
all
return
home
together
then
before
daybreak
we
would
be
in
the
cane
listening
for
the
first
tinkle
to
find
the
cattle
and
remove
the
bell
and
my
work
commenced
anew
only
once
did
i
come
near
betraying
my
trust
about
the
middle
of
the
third
day
i
grew
very
hungry
and
as
the
cattle
were
lying
down
i
crept
to
the
edge
of
the
canebrake
to
see
if
my
dinner
was
not
forthcoming
soldiers
were
in
sight
which
explained
everything
concealed
in
the
rank
cane
i
stood
and
watched
them
suddenly
a
squad
of
five
or
six
turned
a
point
of
the
brake
and
rode
within
fifty
feet
of
me
i
stood
like
a
stone
statue
my
concealment
being
perfect
after
they
had
passed
i
took
a
step
forward
the
better
to
watch
them
as
they
rode
away
when
the
grass
dropped
out
of
the
bell
and
it
clattered
a
soldier
heard
the
tinkle
and
wheeling
his
horse
rode
back
i
grasped
the
clapper
and
lay
flat
on
the
ground
my
heart
beating
like
a
he
rode
within
twenty
feet
of
me
peering
into
the
thicket
of
cane
and
not
seeing
anything
unusual
turned
and
galloped
away
after
his
companions
then
the
lesson
taught
me
by
my
mother
of
being
faithful
over
a
few
things
flashed
through
my
mind
and
though
our
cattle
were
spared
to
us
i
felt
very
guilty
another
vivid
recollection
of
those
boyhood
days
in
georgia
was
the
return
of
my
father
from
the
army
the
news
of
lee
surrender
had
reached
us
and
all
of
us
watched
for
his
coming
though
he
was
long
delayed
when
at
last
he
did
come
riding
home
on
a
brown
mule
he
was
a
conquering
hero
to
us
children
we
had
never
owned
a
horse
and
he
assured
us
that
the
animal
was
his
own
and
by
turns
set
us
on
the
tired
mule
back
he
explained
to
mother
and
us
children
how
though
he
was
an
infantryman
he
came
into
possession
of
the
animal
now
however
with
my
mature
years
and
knowledge
of
brands
i
regret
to
state
that
the
mule
had
not
been
condemned
and
was
in
the
brand
a
story
which
priest
the
rebel
once
told
me
throws
some
light
on
the
matter
he
asserted
that
all
good
soldiers
would
steal
can
you
take
the
city
of
st
louis
was
asked
of
general
price
i
do
know
as
i
can
take
it
replied
the
general
to
his
consulting
superiors
but
if
you
will
give
me
louisiana
troops
i
agree
to
steal
it
though
my
father
had
lost
nothing
by
the
war
he
was
impatient
to
go
to
a
new
country
many
of
his
former
comrades
were
going
to
texas
and
as
our
worldly
possessions
were
movable
to
texas
we
started
our
four
oxen
were
yoked
to
the
wagon
in
which
our
few
household
effects
were
loaded
and
in
which
mother
and
the
smaller
children
rode
and
with
the
cows
dogs
and
elder
boys
bringing
up
the
rear
our
caravan
started
my
father
riding
the
mule
and
driving
the
oxen
it
was
an
entire
summer
trip
full
of
incident
privation
and
hardship
the
stock
fared
well
but
several
times
we
were
compelled
to
halt
and
secure
work
in
order
to
supply
our
limited
larder
through
certain
sections
however
fish
and
game
were
abundant
i
remember
the
enthusiasm
we
all
felt
when
we
reached
the
sabine
river
and
for
the
first
time
viewed
the
promised
land
it
was
at
a
ferry
and
the
sluggish
river
was
deep
when
my
father
informed
the
ferryman
that
he
had
no
money
with
which
to
pay
the
ferriage
the
latter
turned
on
him
remarking
sarcastically
what
no
money
my
dear
sir
it
certainly
ca
make
much
difference
to
a
man
which
side
of
the
river
he
on
when
he
has
no
money
nothing
daunted
by
this
rebuff
my
father
argued
the
point
at
some
length
when
the
ferryman
relented
so
far
as
to
inform
him
that
ten
miles
higher
up
the
river
was
fordable
we
arrived
at
the
ford
the
next
day
my
father
rode
across
and
back
testing
the
stage
of
the
water
and
the
river
bottom
before
driving
the
wagon
in
then
taking
one
of
the
older
boys
behind
him
on
the
mule
in
order
to
lighten
the
wagon
he
drove
the
oxen
into
the
river
near
the
middle
the
water
was
deep
enough
to
reach
the
wagon
box
but
with
shoutings
and
a
free
application
of
the
gad
we
hurried
through
in
safety
one
of
the
wheel
oxen
a
black
steer
which
we
called
could
be
ridden
and
i
straddled
him
in
fording
laving
my
sunburned
feet
in
the
cool
water
the
cows
were
driven
over
next
the
dogs
swimming
and
at
last
bag
and
baggage
we
were
in
texas
we
reached
the
colorado
river
early
in
the
fall
where
we
stopped
and
picked
cotton
for
several
months
making
quite
a
bit
of
money
and
near
christmas
reached
our
final
destination
on
the
san
antonio
river
where
we
took
up
land
and
built
a
house
that
was
a
happy
home
the
country
was
new
and
supplied
our
simple
wants
we
had
milk
and
honey
and
though
the
fig
tree
was
absent
along
the
river
grew
endless
quantities
of
mustang
grapes
at
that
time
the
san
antonio
valley
was
principally
a
cattle
country
and
as
the
boys
of
our
family
grew
old
enough
the
fascination
of
a
horse
and
saddle
was
too
strong
to
be
resisted
my
two
older
brothers
went
first
but
my
father
and
mother
made
strenuous
efforts
to
keep
me
at
home
and
did
so
until
i
was
sixteen
i
suppose
it
is
natural
for
every
country
boy
to
be
fascinated
with
some
other
occupation
than
the
one
to
which
he
is
bred
in
my
early
teens
i
always
thought
i
should
like
either
to
drive
six
horses
to
a
stage
or
clerk
in
a
store
and
if
i
could
have
attained
either
of
those
lofty
heights
at
that
age
i
would
have
asked
no
more
so
my
father
rather
than
see
me
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
my
older
brothers
secured
me
a
situation
in
a
village
store
some
twenty
miles
distant
the
storekeeper
was
a
fellow
countryman
of
my
father
from
the
same
county
in
ireland
in
fact
and
i
was
duly
elated
on
getting
away
from
home
to
the
life
of
the
village
but
my
elation
was
i
was
to
receive
no
wages
for
the
first
six
months
my
father
counseled
the
merchant
to
work
me
hard
and
if
possible
cure
me
of
the
foolish
notion
as
he
termed
it
the
storekeeper
cured
me
the
first
week
i
was
with
him
he
kept
me
in
a
back
warehouse
shelling
corn
the
second
week
started
out
no
better
i
was
given
a
shovel
and
put
on
the
street
to
work
out
the
not
only
of
the
merchant
but
of
two
other
clerks
in
the
store
here
was
two
weeks
work
in
sight
but
the
third
morning
i
took
breakfast
at
home
my
mercantile
career
had
ended
and
forthwith
i
took
to
the
range
as
a
preacher
son
takes
to
vice
by
the
time
i
was
twenty
there
was
no
better
in
the
entire
country
i
could
besides
speak
spanish
and
play
the
fiddle
and
thought
nothing
of
riding
thirty
miles
to
a
dance
the
vagabond
temperament
of
the
range
i
easily
assimilated
christmas
in
the
south
is
always
a
season
of
festivity
and
the
magnet
of
mother
and
home
yearly
drew
us
to
the
family
hearthstone
there
we
brothers
met
and
exchanged
stories
of
our
experiences
but
one
year
both
my
brothers
brought
home
a
new
experience
they
had
been
up
the
trail
and
the
wondrous
stories
they
told
about
the
northern
country
set
my
blood
on
fire
until
then
i
thought
i
had
had
adventures
but
mine
paled
into
insignificance
beside
theirs
the
following
summer
my
eldest
brother
robert
himself
was
to
boss
a
herd
up
the
trail
and
i
pleaded
with
him
to
give
me
a
berth
but
he
refused
me
saying
no
tommy
the
trail
is
one
place
where
a
foreman
can
have
no
favorites
hardship
and
privation
must
be
met
and
the
men
must
throw
themselves
equally
into
the
collar
i
do
doubt
but
you
a
good
hand
still
the
fact
that
you
my
brother
might
cause
other
boys
to
think
i
would
favor
you
a
trail
outfit
has
to
work
as
a
unit
and
dissensions
would
be
ruinous
i
had
seen
favoritism
shown
on
ranches
and
understood
his
position
to
be
right
still
i
felt
that
i
must
make
that
trip
if
it
were
possible
finally
robert
seeing
that
i
was
overanxious
to
go
came
to
me
and
said
i
been
thinking
that
if
i
recommended
you
to
jim
flood
my
old
foreman
he
might
take
you
with
him
next
year
he
is
to
have
a
herd
that
will
take
five
months
from
start
to
delivery
and
that
will
be
the
chance
of
your
life
i
see
him
next
week
and
make
a
strong
talk
for
you
true
to
his
word
he
bespoke
me
a
job
with
flood
the
next
time
he
met
him
and
a
week
later
a
letter
from
flood
reached
me
terse
and
pointed
engaging
my
services
as
a
trail
hand
for
the
coming
summer
the
outfit
would
pass
near
our
home
on
its
way
to
receive
the
cattle
which
were
to
make
up
the
trail
herd
time
and
place
were
appointed
where
i
was
to
meet
them
in
the
middle
of
march
and
i
felt
as
if
i
were
made
i
remember
my
mother
and
sisters
twitted
me
about
the
swagger
that
came
into
my
walk
after
the
receipt
of
flood
letter
and
even
asserted
that
i
sat
my
horse
as
straight
as
a
poker
possibly
but
was
i
going
up
the
trail
with
jim
flood
the
boss
foreman
of
don
lovell
the
cowman
and
drover
our
little
ranch
was
near
cibollo
ford
on
the
river
and
as
the
outfit
passed
down
the
country
they
crossed
at
that
ford
and
picked
me
up
flood
was
not
with
them
which
was
a
disappointment
to
me
quince
forrest
acting
as
at
the
time
they
had
four
mules
to
the
chuck
wagon
under
barney
mccann
as
cook
while
the
under
billy
honeyman
as
horse
wrangler
numbered
a
hundred
and
ten
horses
to
the
man
with
two
extra
for
the
foreman
then
for
the
first
time
i
learned
that
we
were
going
down
to
the
mouth
of
the
rio
grande
to
receive
the
herd
from
across
the
river
in
old
mexico
and
that
they
were
contracted
for
delivery
on
the
blackfoot
indian
reservation
in
the
northwest
corner
of
montana
lovell
had
several
contracts
with
the
indian
department
of
the
government
that
year
and
had
been
granted
the
privilege
of
bringing
in
free
of
duty
any
cattle
to
be
used
in
filling
indian
contracts
my
worst
trouble
was
getting
away
from
home
on
the
morning
of
starting
mother
and
my
sisters
of
course
shed
a
few
tears
but
my
father
stern
and
unbending
in
his
manner
gave
me
his
benediction
in
these
words
thomas
moore
you
the
third
son
to
leave
our
roof
but
your
father
blessing
goes
with
you
i
left
my
own
home
beyond
the
sea
before
i
was
your
age
and
as
they
all
stood
at
the
gate
i
climbed
into
my
saddle
and
rode
away
with
a
lump
in
my
throat
which
left
me
speechless
to
reply
chapter
ii
receiving
it
was
a
nice
ten
days
trip
from
the
san
antonio
to
the
rio
grande
river
we
made
to
thirty
miles
a
day
giving
the
saddle
horses
all
the
advantage
of
grazing
on
the
way
rather
than
hobble
forrest
them
using
five
guards
two
men
to
the
watch
of
two
hours
each
as
i
have
little
hope
of
ever
rising
to
the
dignity
of
foreman
said
our
while
arranging
the
guards
take
this
occasion
to
show
you
varmints
what
an
iron
will
i
possess
with
the
amount
of
help
i
have
i
do
propose
to
even
catch
a
night
horse
and
i
give
the
cook
orders
to
bring
me
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
cigarette
before
i
arise
in
the
morning
i
been
up
the
trail
before
and
realize
that
this
authority
is
so
i
propose
to
make
the
most
of
it
while
it
lasts
now
you
all
know
your
places
and
see
you
do
incur
your
foreman
displeasure
the
outfit
reached
brownsville
on
march
where
we
picked
up
flood
and
lovell
and
dropping
down
the
river
about
six
miles
below
fort
brown
went
into
camp
at
a
cattle
ford
known
as
paso
ganado
the
rio
grande
was
two
hundred
yards
wide
at
this
point
and
at
its
then
stage
was
almost
swimming
from
bank
to
bank
it
had
very
little
current
and
when
winds
were
favorable
the
tide
from
the
gulf
ran
in
above
the
ford
flood
had
spent
the
past
two
weeks
across
the
river
receiving
and
the
herd
so
when
the
cattle
should
reach
the
river
on
the
mexican
side
we
were
in
honor
bound
to
accept
everything
bearing
the
circle
dot
the
left
hip
the
contract
called
for
a
thousand
she
cattle
three
and
four
years
of
age
and
two
thousand
four
and
five
year
old
beeves
estimated
as
sufficient
to
fill
a
beef
contract
for
fear
of
losses
on
the
trail
our
foreman
had
accepted
fifty
extra
head
of
each
class
and
our
herd
at
starting
would
number
hundred
head
they
were
coming
up
from
ranches
in
the
interior
and
we
expected
to
cross
them
the
first
favorable
day
after
their
arrival
a
number
of
different
rancheros
had
turned
in
cattle
in
making
up
the
herd
and
flood
reported
them
in
good
strong
condition
lovell
and
flood
were
a
good
team
of
cowmen
the
former
as
a
youth
had
carried
a
musket
in
the
ranks
of
the
union
army
and
at
the
end
of
that
struggle
cast
his
fortune
with
texas
where
others
had
seen
nothing
but
the
desolation
of
war
lovell
saw
opportunities
of
business
and
had
yearly
forged
ahead
as
a
drover
and
beef
contractor
he
was
well
calculated
to
manage
the
cattle
business
but
was
irritable
and
inclined
to
borrow
trouble
therefore
unqualified
personally
to
oversee
the
actual
management
of
a
cow
herd
in
repose
don
lovell
was
slow
almost
dull
but
in
an
emergency
was
astonishingly
and
alert
he
never
insisted
on
temperance
among
his
men
and
though
usually
of
a
placid
temperament
when
out
of
tobacco
lord
jim
flood
on
the
other
hand
was
in
a
hundred
respects
the
antithesis
of
his
employer
born
to
the
soil
of
texas
he
knew
nothing
but
cattle
but
he
knew
them
thoroughly
yet
in
their
calling
the
pair
were
a
harmonious
unit
he
never
crossed
a
bridge
till
he
reached
it
was
indulgent
with
his
men
and
would
overlook
any
fault
so
long
as
they
rendered
faithful
service
priest
told
me
this
incident
flood
had
hired
a
man
at
red
river
the
year
before
when
a
guardian
present
called
flood
to
one
side
and
said
do
you
know
that
that
man
you
just
hired
is
the
worst
drunkard
in
this
country
no
i
did
know
it
replied
flood
but
i
glad
to
hear
he
is
i
do
want
to
ruin
an
innocent
man
and
a
trail
outfit
is
not
supposed
to
have
any
morals
just
so
the
herd
do
count
out
shy
on
the
day
of
delivery
i
do
mind
how
many
drinks
the
outfit
takes
the
next
morning
after
going
into
camp
the
first
thing
was
the
allotment
of
our
mounts
for
the
trip
flood
had
the
first
pick
and
cut
twelve
bays
and
browns
his
preference
for
solid
colors
though
they
were
not
the
largest
in
the
showed
his
practical
sense
of
horses
when
it
came
the
boys
turn
to
cut
we
were
only
allowed
to
cut
one
at
a
time
by
turns
even
casting
lots
for
first
choice
we
had
ridden
the
horses
enough
to
have
a
fair
idea
as
to
their
merits
and
every
lad
was
his
own
judge
there
were
as
it
happened
only
three
pinto
horses
in
the
entire
saddle
stock
and
these
three
were
the
last
left
of
the
entire
bunch
now
a
little
boy
or
girl
and
many
an
older
person
thinks
that
a
spotted
horse
is
the
real
thing
but
practical
cattle
men
know
that
this
freak
of
color
in
horses
is
the
result
of
breeding
with
consequent
physical
and
mental
deterioration
it
was
my
good
fortune
that
morning
to
get
a
good
mount
of
horses
three
sorrels
two
grays
two
coyotes
a
black
a
brown
and
a
the
black
was
my
second
pick
and
though
the
color
is
not
a
hardy
one
his
indicated
that
he
could
carry
food
for
a
long
ride
and
ought
to
be
a
good
swimmer
my
judgment
of
him
was
confirmed
throughout
the
trip
as
i
used
him
for
my
night
horse
and
when
we
had
swimming
rivers
to
ford
i
gave
this
black
the
name
of
nigger
boy
for
the
trip
each
man
was
expected
to
furnish
his
own
accoutrements
in
saddles
we
had
the
ordinary
texas
make
the
housings
of
which
covered
our
mounts
from
withers
to
hips
and
would
weigh
from
thirty
to
forty
pounds
bedecked
with
the
latest
in
the
way
of
trimmings
and
trappings
our
bridles
were
in
keeping
with
the
saddles
the
reins
as
long
as
plough
lines
while
the
bit
was
frequently
ornamental
and
costly
the
indispensable
slicker
a
greatcoat
of
oiled
canvas
was
ever
at
hand
securely
tied
to
our
cantle
strings
spurs
were
a
matter
of
taste
if
a
rider
carried
a
quirt
he
usually
dispensed
with
spurs
though
when
used
those
with
large
dull
rowels
were
the
make
commonly
chosen
in
the
matter
of
leggings
not
over
half
our
outfit
had
any
as
a
trail
herd
always
kept
in
the
open
and
except
for
night
herding
they
were
too
warm
in
summer
our
craft
never
used
a
cattle
whip
but
if
emergency
required
the
loose
end
of
a
rope
served
instead
and
was
more
humane
either
flood
or
lovell
went
into
town
every
afternoon
with
some
of
the
boys
expecting
to
hear
from
the
cattle
on
one
trip
they
took
along
the
wagon
laying
in
a
month
supplies
the
rest
of
us
amused
ourselves
in
various
ways
one
afternoon
when
the
tide
was
in
we
tried
our
swimming
horses
in
the
river
stripping
to
our
underclothing
and
with
nothing
but
a
bridle
on
our
horses
plunged
into
tidewater
my
nigger
boy
swam
from
bank
to
bank
like
a
duck
on
the
return
i
slid
off
behind
and
taking
his
tail
let
him
tow
me
to
our
own
side
where
he
arrived
snorting
like
a
tugboat
one
evening
on
their
return
from
brownsville
flood
brought
word
that
the
herd
would
camp
that
night
within
fifteen
miles
of
the
river
at
daybreak
lovell
and
the
foreman
with
fox
quarternight
and
myself
started
to
meet
the
herd
the
nearest
ferry
was
at
brownsville
and
it
was
eleven
when
we
reached
the
cattle
flood
had
dispensed
with
an
interpreter
and
had
taken
quarternight
and
me
along
to
do
the
interpreting
the
cattle
were
well
shed
and
in
good
flesh
for
such
an
early
season
of
the
year
and
in
receiving
our
foreman
had
been
careful
and
had
accepted
only
such
as
had
strength
for
a
long
voyage
they
were
the
southern
cattle
as
a
rule
possessed
the
running
powers
of
a
deer
and
in
an
ordinary
walk
could
travel
with
a
horse
they
had
about
thirty
vaqueros
under
a
corporal
driving
the
herd
and
the
cattle
were
strung
out
in
regular
trailing
manner
we
rode
with
them
until
the
noon
hour
when
with
the
understanding
that
they
were
to
bring
the
herd
to
paso
ganado
by
ten
the
following
day
we
rode
for
matamoros
lovell
had
other
herds
to
start
on
the
trail
that
year
and
was
very
anxious
to
cross
the
cattle
the
following
day
so
as
to
get
the
weekly
steamer
the
only
mode
of
travel
which
left
point
isabel
for
galveston
on
the
first
of
april
the
next
morning
was
bright
and
clear
with
an
east
wind
which
insured
a
flood
tide
in
the
river
on
first
sighting
the
herd
that
morning
we
made
ready
to
cross
them
as
soon
as
they
reached
the
river
the
wagon
was
moved
up
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
ford
and
a
substantial
corral
of
ropes
was
stretched
then
the
entire
saddle
stock
was
driven
in
so
as
to
be
at
hand
in
case
a
hasty
change
of
mounts
was
required
by
this
time
honeyman
knew
the
horses
of
each
man
mount
so
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
sing
out
our
horse
and
billy
would
have
a
rope
on
one
and
have
him
at
hand
before
you
could
unsaddle
a
tired
one
on
account
of
our
linguistic
accomplishments
quarternight
and
i
were
to
be
sent
across
the
river
to
put
the
cattle
in
and
otherwise
assume
control
on
the
mexican
side
there
was
a
single
string
of
high
brush
fence
on
the
lower
side
of
the
ford
commencing
well
out
in
the
water
and
running
back
about
two
hundred
yards
thus
giving
us
a
half
chute
in
forcing
the
cattle
to
take
swimming
water
this
ford
had
been
in
use
for
years
in
crossing
cattle
but
i
believe
this
was
the
first
herd
ever
crossed
that
was
intended
for
the
trail
or
for
beyond
the
bounds
of
texas
when
the
herd
was
within
a
mile
of
the
river
fox
and
i
shed
our
saddles
boots
and
surplus
clothing
and
started
to
meet
it
the
water
was
chilly
but
we
struck
it
with
a
shout
and
with
the
cheers
of
our
outfit
behind
us
swam
like
smugglers
a
swimming
horse
needs
freedom
and
we
scarcely
touched
the
reins
but
with
one
hand
buried
in
a
mane
hold
and
giving
gentle
slaps
on
the
neck
with
the
other
we
guided
our
horses
for
the
other
shore
i
was
proving
out
my
black
fox
had
a
gray
of
equal
barrel
displacement
both
good
swimmers
and
on
reaching
the
mexican
shore
we
dismounted
and
allowed
them
to
roll
in
the
warm
sand
flood
had
given
us
general
instructions
and
we
halted
the
herd
about
half
a
mile
from
the
river
the
mexican
corporal
was
only
too
glad
to
have
us
assume
charge
and
assured
us
that
he
and
his
outfit
were
ours
to
command
i
at
once
proclaimed
fox
quarternight
whose
years
and
experience
outranked
mine
the
corporal
for
the
day
at
which
the
vaqueros
smiled
but
i
noticed
they
never
used
the
word
on
suggestion
the
mexican
corporal
brought
up
his
wagon
and
corralled
his
horses
as
we
had
done
when
his
cook
to
our
delight
invited
all
to
have
coffee
before
starting
that
cook
won
our
everlasting
regards
for
his
coffee
was
delicious
we
praised
it
highly
whereupon
the
corporal
ordered
the
cook
to
have
it
at
hand
for
the
men
in
the
intervals
between
crossing
the
different
bunches
of
cattle
a
march
day
on
the
rio
grande
with
wet
clothing
is
not
summer
and
the
vaqueros
hesitated
a
bit
before
following
the
example
of
quarternight
and
myself
and
dispensing
with
saddles
and
boots
five
men
were
then
detailed
to
hold
the
herd
as
compact
as
possible
and
the
remainder
all
told
cut
off
about
three
hundred
head
and
started
for
the
river
i
took
the
lead
for
though
cattle
are
less
gregarious
by
nature
than
other
animals
under
pressure
of
excitement
they
will
follow
a
leader
it
was
about
noon
and
the
herd
were
thirsty
so
when
we
reached
the
brush
chute
all
hands
started
them
on
a
run
for
the
water
when
the
cattle
were
once
inside
the
wing
we
went
rapidly
four
vaqueros
riding
outside
the
fence
to
keep
the
cattle
from
turning
the
chute
on
reaching
swimming
water
the
leaders
were
crowding
me
close
when
nigger
breasted
the
water
and
closely
followed
by
several
lead
cattle
i
struck
straight
for
the
american
shore
the
vaqueros
forced
every
hoof
into
the
river
following
and
shouting
as
far
as
the
midstream
when
they
were
swimming
so
nicely
quarternight
called
off
the
men
and
all
turned
their
horses
back
to
the
mexican
side
on
landing
opposite
the
exit
from
the
ford
our
men
held
the
cattle
as
they
came
out
in
order
to
bait
the
next
bunch
i
rested
my
horse
only
a
few
minutes
before
taking
the
water
again
but
lovell
urged
me
to
take
an
extra
horse
across
so
as
to
have
a
change
in
case
my
black
became
fagged
in
swimming
quarternight
was
a
harsh
for
no
sooner
had
i
reached
the
other
bank
than
he
cut
off
the
second
bunch
of
about
four
hundred
and
started
them
turning
nigger
boy
loose
behind
the
brush
fence
so
as
to
be
out
of
the
way
i
galloped
out
on
my
second
horse
and
meeting
the
cattle
turned
and
again
took
the
lead
for
the
river
my
substitute
did
not
swim
with
the
freedom
and
ease
of
the
black
and
several
times
cattle
swam
so
near
me
that
i
could
lay
my
hand
on
their
backs
when
about
halfway
over
i
heard
shoutings
behind
me
in
english
and
on
looking
back
saw
nigger
boy
swimming
after
us
a
number
of
vaqueros
attempted
to
catch
him
but
he
outswam
them
and
came
out
with
the
cattle
the
excitement
was
too
much
for
him
to
miss
each
trip
was
a
repetition
of
the
former
with
varying
incident
every
hoof
was
over
in
less
than
two
hours
on
the
last
trip
in
which
there
were
about
seven
hundred
head
the
horse
of
one
of
the
mexican
vaqueros
took
cramps
it
was
supposed
at
about
the
middle
of
the
river
and
sank
without
a
moment
warning
a
number
of
us
heard
the
man
terrified
cry
only
in
time
to
see
horse
and
rider
sink
every
man
within
reach
turned
to
the
rescue
and
a
moment
later
the
man
rose
to
the
surface
fox
caught
him
by
the
shirt
and
shaking
the
water
out
of
him
turned
him
over
to
one
of
the
other
vaqueros
who
towed
him
back
to
their
own
side
strange
as
it
may
appear
the
horse
never
came
to
the
surface
again
which
supported
the
supposition
of
cramps
after
a
change
of
clothes
for
quarternight
and
myself
and
rather
late
dinner
for
all
hands
there
yet
remained
the
counting
of
the
herd
the
mexican
corporal
and
two
of
his
men
had
come
over
for
the
purpose
and
though
lovell
and
several
wealthy
rancheros
the
sellers
of
the
cattle
were
present
it
remained
for
flood
and
the
corporal
to
make
the
final
count
as
between
buyer
and
seller
there
was
also
present
a
river
guard
sent
out
by
the
united
states
custom
house
as
a
matter
of
form
in
the
entry
papers
who
also
insisted
on
counting
in
order
to
have
a
second
count
on
the
herd
lovell
ordered
the
rebel
to
count
opposite
the
government
man
we
strung
the
cattle
out
now
logy
with
water
and
after
making
quite
a
circle
brought
the
herd
around
where
there
was
quite
a
bluff
bank
of
the
river
the
herd
handled
well
and
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
lined
them
between
our
four
mounted
counters
the
only
difference
in
the
manner
of
counting
between
flood
and
the
mexican
corporal
was
that
the
american
used
a
tally
string
tied
to
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
on
which
were
ten
knots
keeping
count
by
slipping
a
knot
on
each
even
hundred
while
the
mexican
used
ten
small
pebbles
shifting
a
pebble
from
one
hand
to
the
other
on
hundreds
just
a
mere
difference
in
nationality
lovell
had
me
interpret
to
the
selling
dons
when
the
count
ended
only
two
of
the
men
agreed
on
numbers
the
rebel
and
the
corporal
making
the
same
hundred
and
five
flood
being
one
under
and
the
custom
house
man
one
over
lovell
at
once
accepted
the
count
of
priest
and
the
corporal
and
the
delivery
which
as
i
learned
during
the
interpreting
that
followed
was
to
be
sealed
with
a
supper
that
night
in
brownsville
was
consummated
lovell
was
compelled
to
leave
us
to
make
the
final
payment
for
the
herd
and
we
would
not
see
him
again
for
some
time
they
were
all
seated
in
the
vehicle
ready
to
start
for
town
when
the
cowman
said
to
his
foreman

and
i
had
better
quit
cows
i
had
been
detained
to
do
any
interpreting
needful
and
at
parting
lovell
beckoned
to
me
when
i
rode
alongside
the
carriage
he
gave
me
his
hand
and
said
flood
tells
me
that
you
a
brother
of
bob
quirk
bob
is
to
be
foreman
of
my
herd
that
i
putting
up
in
nueces
county
i
glad
you
here
with
jim
though
for
it
a
longer
trip
yes
you
get
all
the
circus
there
is
and
stay
for
the
concert
besides
they
say
god
is
good
to
the
poor
and
the
irish
and
if
that
so
you
pull
through
all
right
son
and
as
he
gave
me
a
hearty
ringing
grip
of
the
hand
i
could
help
feeling
friendly
toward
him
yankee
that
he
was
after
lovell
and
the
dons
had
gone
flood
ordered
mccann
to
move
his
wagon
back
from
the
river
about
a
mile
it
was
now
too
late
in
the
day
to
start
the
herd
and
we
wanted
to
graze
them
well
as
it
was
our
first
night
with
them
about
half
our
outfit
grazed
them
around
on
a
large
circle
preparatory
to
bringing
them
up
to
the
bed
ground
as
it
grew
dusk
in
the
untrammeled
freedom
of
the
native
range
a
cow
or
steer
will
pick
old
dry
grass
on
which
to
lie
down
and
if
it
is
summer
will
prefer
an
elevation
sufficient
to
catch
any
passing
breeze
flood
was
familiar
with
the
habits
of
cattle
and
selected
a
nice
elevation
on
which
the
old
dry
grass
of
the
previous
growth
lay
matted
like
a
carpet
our
saddle
horses
by
this
time
were
fairly
well
broken
to
camp
life
and
with
the
cattle
on
hand
night
herding
them
had
to
be
abandoned
billy
honeyman
however
had
noticed
several
horses
that
were
inclined
to
stray
on
day
herd
and
these
few
leaders
were
so
well
marked
in
his
memory
that
as
a
matter
of
precaution
he
insisted
on
putting
a
rope
hobble
on
them
at
every
noon
and
night
camp
we
strung
a
rope
from
the
hind
wheel
of
our
wagon
and
another
from
the
end
of
the
wagon
tongue
back
to
stakes
driven
in
the
ground
or
held
by
a
man
forming
a
triangular
corral
thus
in
a
few
minutes
under
any
conditions
we
could
construct
a
temporary
corral
for
catching
a
change
of
mounts
or
for
the
wrangler
to
hobble
untrustworthy
horses
on
the
trail
all
horses
are
free
at
night
except
the
regular
night
ones
which
are
used
constantly
during
the
entire
trip
and
under
ordinary
conditions
keep
strong
and
improve
in
flesh
before
the
herd
was
brought
in
for
the
night
and
during
the
supper
hour
flood
announced
the
guards
for
the
trip
as
the
men
usually
bunked
in
pairs
the
foreman
chose
them
as
they
slept
but
was
under
the
necessity
of
splitting
two
berths
of
bedfellows
rod
wheat
joe
stallings
and
ash
borrowstone
were
assigned
to
the
first
guard
from
eight
to
ten
thirty
bob
blades
bull
durham
and
fox
quarternight
were
given
second
guard
from
ten
thirty
to
one
paul
priest
john
officer
and
myself
made
up
the
third
watch
from
one
to
three
thirty
the
rebel
and
i
were
bunkies
and
this
choice
of
guards
while
not
ideal
was
much
better
than
splitting
bedfellows
and
having
them
annoy
each
other
by
going
out
and
returning
from
guard
separately
the
only
fault
i
ever
found
with
priest
was
that
he
could
use
the
poorest
judgment
in
selecting
a
bed
ground
for
our
blankets
and
always
talked
and
told
stories
to
me
until
i
fell
asleep
he
was
a
light
sleeper
himself
while
i
being
much
younger
was
the
reverse
the
fourth
and
last
guard
from
three
thirty
until
relieved
after
daybreak
fell
to
wyatt
roundtree
quince
forrest
and
moss
strayhorn
thus
the
only
men
in
the
outfit
not
on
night
duty
were
honeyman
our
horse
wrangler
barney
mccann
our
cook
and
flood
the
foreman
the
latter
however
made
up
by
riding
almost
double
as
much
as
any
man
in
his
outfit
he
never
left
the
herd
until
it
was
bedded
down
for
the
night
and
we
could
always
hear
him
quietly
arousing
the
cook
and
horse
wrangler
an
hour
before
daybreak
he
always
kept
a
horse
on
picket
for
the
night
and
often
took
the
herd
as
it
left
the
bed
ground
at
clear
dawn
a
half
hour
before
dark
flood
and
all
the
herd
men
turned
out
to
bed
down
the
cattle
for
our
first
night
they
had
been
well
grazed
after
counting
and
as
they
came
up
to
the
bed
ground
there
was
not
a
hungry
or
thirsty
animal
in
the
lot
all
seemed
anxious
to
lie
down
and
by
circling
around
slowly
while
gradually
closing
in
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
all
were
bedded
nicely
on
possibly
five
or
six
acres
i
remember
there
were
a
number
of
muleys
among
the
cattle
and
these
would
not
venture
into
the
compact
herd
until
the
others
had
lain
down
being
hornless
instinct
taught
them
to
be
on
the
defensive
and
it
was
noticeable
that
they
were
the
first
to
arise
in
the
morning
in
advance
of
their
horned
kin
when
all
had
lain
down
flood
and
the
first
guard
remained
the
others
returning
to
the
wagon
the
guards
ride
in
a
circle
about
four
rods
outside
the
sleeping
cattle
and
by
riding
in
opposite
directions
make
it
impossible
for
any
animal
to
make
its
escape
without
being
noticed
by
the
riders
the
guards
usually
sing
or
whistle
continuously
so
that
the
sleeping
herd
may
know
that
a
friend
and
not
an
enemy
is
keeping
vigil
over
their
dreams
a
sleeping
herd
of
cattle
make
a
pretty
picture
on
a
clear
moonlight
night
chewing
their
cuds
and
grunting
and
blowing
over
contented
stomachs
the
night
horses
soon
learn
their
duty
and
a
rider
may
fall
asleep
or
doze
along
in
the
saddle
but
the
horses
will
maintain
their
distance
in
their
leisurely
sentinel
rounds
on
returning
to
the
wagon
priest
and
i
picketed
our
horses
saddled
where
we
could
easily
find
them
in
the
darkness
and
unrolled
our
bed
we
had
two
pairs
of
blankets
each
which
with
an
ordinary
wagon
sheet
doubled
for
a
tarpaulin
and
coats
and
boots
for
pillows
completed
our
couch
we
slept
otherwise
in
our
clothing
worn
during
the
day
and
if
smooth
sandy
ground
was
available
on
which
to
spread
our
bed
we
had
no
trouble
in
sleeping
the
sleep
that
long
hours
in
the
saddle
were
certain
to
bring
with
all
his
pardonable
faults
the
rebel
was
a
good
bunkie
and
a
hail
companion
this
being
his
sixth
trip
over
the
trail
he
had
been
with
lovell
over
a
year
before
the
two
made
the
discovery
that
they
had
been
on
opposite
sides
during
the
late
unpleasantness
on
making
this
discovery
lovell
at
once
rechristened
priest
the
rebel
and
that
name
he
always
bore
he
was
fifteen
years
my
senior
at
this
time
a
wonderfully
complex
nature
hardened
by
unusual
experiences
into
a
character
the
gamut
of
whose
moods
ran
from
that
of
a
fellow
to
a
man
of
unrelenting
severity
in
anger
we
were
sleeping
a
nine
knot
gale
when
fox
quarternight
of
the
second
guard
called
us
on
our
watch
it
was
a
clear
starry
night
and
our
guard
soon
passed
the
cattle
sleeping
like
tired
soldiers
when
the
last
relief
came
on
guard
and
we
had
returned
to
our
blankets
i
remember
priest
telling
me
this
little
incident
as
i
fell
asleep
i
was
at
a
dance
once
in
live
oak
county
and
there
was
a
stuttering
fellow
there
by
the
name
of
lem
todhunter
the
girls
it
seems
care
to
dance
with
him
and
pretended
they
could
understand
him
he
had
asked
every
girl
at
the
party
and
received
the
same
answer
from
each
they
could
understand
him
to
hell
then
understand
that
he
said
to
the
last
girl
and
her
brother
threatened
to
mangle
him
horribly
if
he
apologize
to
which
he
finally
agreed
he
went
back
into
the
house
and
said
to
the
girl
to
hell
and
i
have
other
chapter
iii
the
start
on
the
morning
of
april
our
circle
dot
herd
started
on
its
long
tramp
to
the
blackfoot
agency
in
montana
with
six
men
on
each
side
and
the
herd
strung
out
for
three
quarters
of
a
mile
it
could
only
be
compared
to
some
mythical
serpent
or
chinese
dragon
as
it
moved
forward
on
its
sinuous
course
two
riders
known
as
point
men
rode
out
and
well
back
from
the
lead
cattle
and
by
riding
forward
and
closing
in
as
occasion
required
directed
the
course
of
the
herd
the
main
body
of
the
herd
trailed
along
behind
the
leaders
like
an
army
in
loose
marching
order
guarded
by
outriders
known
as
swing
men
who
rode
well
out
from
the
advancing
column
warding
off
range
cattle
and
seeing
that
none
of
the
herd
wandered
away
or
dropped
out
there
was
no
driving
to
do
the
cattle
moved
of
their
own
free
will
as
in
ordinary
travel
flood
seldom
gave
orders
but
as
a
number
of
us
had
never
worked
on
the
trail
before
at
breakfast
on
the
morning
of
our
start
he
gave
in
substance
these
general
directions
boys
the
secret
of
trailing
cattle
is
never
to
let
your
herd
know
that
they
are
under
restraint
let
everything
that
is
done
be
done
voluntarily
by
the
cattle
from
the
moment
you
let
them
off
the
bed
ground
in
the
morning
until
they
are
bedded
at
night
never
let
a
cow
take
a
step
except
in
the
direction
of
its
destination
in
this
manner
you
can
loaf
away
the
day
and
cover
from
fifteen
to
twenty
miles
and
the
herd
in
the
mean
time
will
enjoy
all
the
freedom
of
an
open
range
of
course
it
long
tiresome
hours
to
the
men
but
the
condition
of
the
herd
and
saddle
stock
demands
sacrifices
on
our
part
if
any
have
to
be
made
and
i
want
to
caution
you
younger
boys
about
your
horses
there
is
such
a
thing
as
having
ten
horses
in
your
string
and
at
the
same
time
being
afoot
you
are
all
well
mounted
and
on
the
condition
of
the
depends
the
success
and
safety
of
the
herd
accidents
will
happen
to
horses
but
do
let
it
be
your
fault
keep
your
saddle
blankets
dry
and
clean
for
no
better
word
can
be
spoken
of
a
man
than
that
he
is
careful
of
his
horses
ordinarily
a
man
might
get
along
with
six
or
eight
horses
but
in
such
emergencies
as
we
are
liable
to
meet
we
have
not
a
horse
to
spare
and
a
man
afoot
is
useless
and
as
all
of
us
younger
boys
learned
afterward
there
was
plenty
of
good
solid
in
flood
advice
for
before
the
trip
ended
there
were
men
in
our
outfit
who
were
as
good
as
afoot
while
others
had
their
original
mounts
every
one
fit
for
the
saddle
flood
had
insisted
on
a
good
mount
of
horses
and
lovell
was
cowman
enough
to
know
that
what
the
mule
is
to
the
army
the
is
to
the
herd
the
first
and
second
day
out
there
was
no
incident
worth
mentioning
we
traveled
slowly
hardly
making
an
average
day
drive
the
third
morning
flood
left
us
to
look
out
a
crossing
on
the
arroyo
colorado
on
coming
down
to
receive
the
herd
we
had
crossed
this
sluggish
bayou
about
miles
north
of
brownsville
it
was
a
stream
being
over
fifty
feet
deep
and
between
bluff
banks
we
ferried
our
wagon
and
saddle
horses
over
swimming
the
loose
ones
but
the
herd
was
keeping
near
the
coast
line
for
the
sake
of
open
country
and
it
was
a
question
if
there
was
a
ford
for
the
wagon
as
near
the
coast
as
our
course
was
carrying
us
the
murmurings
of
the
gulf
had
often
reached
our
ears
the
day
before
and
herds
had
been
known
in
former
years
to
cross
from
the
mainland
over
to
padre
island
the
intervening
laguna
madre
being
fordable
we
were
nooning
when
flood
returned
with
the
news
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
cross
our
wagon
at
any
point
on
the
bayou
and
that
we
would
have
to
ford
around
the
mouth
of
the
stream
where
the
fresh
and
salt
water
met
in
the
laguna
there
had
formed
a
delta
or
shallow
bar
and
by
following
its
contour
we
would
not
have
over
twelve
to
fourteen
inches
of
water
though
the
half
circle
was
nearly
two
miles
in
length
as
we
would
barely
have
time
to
cross
that
day
the
herd
was
at
once
started
veering
for
the
mouth
of
the
arroyo
colorado
on
reaching
it
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
foreman
led
the
way
having
crossed
in
the
morning
and
learned
the
ford
the
wagon
followed
the
saddle
horses
came
next
while
the
herd
brought
up
the
rear
it
proved
good
footing
on
the
sandbar
but
the
water
in
the
laguna
was
too
salty
for
the
cattle
though
the
loose
horses
lay
down
and
wallowed
in
it
we
were
about
an
hour
in
crossing
and
on
reaching
the
mainland
met
a
vaquero
who
directed
us
to
a
large
lake
a
few
miles
inland
where
we
camped
for
the
night
it
proved
an
ideal
camp
with
wood
water
and
grass
in
abundance
and
very
little
range
stock
to
annoy
us
we
had
watered
the
herd
just
before
noon
and
before
throwing
them
upon
the
bed
ground
for
the
night
watered
them
a
second
time
we
had
a
splendid
that
night
of
dry
live
oak
logs
and
after
supper
was
over
and
the
first
guard
had
taken
the
herd
smoking
and
story
telling
were
the
order
of
the
evening
the
is
to
all
outdoor
life
what
the
evening
fireside
is
to
domestic
life
after
the
labors
of
the
day
are
over
the
men
gather
around
the
fire
and
the
social
hour
of
the
day
is
spent
in
yarning
the
stories
told
may
run
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
from
a
true
incident
to
a
base
fabrication
or
from
a
touching
bit
of
pathos
to
the
most
vulgar
vulgarity
have
i
ever
told
this
outfit
my
experience
with
the
vigilantes
when
i
was
a
kid
inquired
bull
durham
there
was
a
general
negative
response
and
he
proceeded
well
our
folks
were
living
on
the
frio
at
the
time
and
there
was
a
man
in
our
neighborhood
who
had
an
outfit
of
four
men
out
beyond
nueces
cañon
hunting
wild
cattle
for
their
hides
it
was
necessary
to
take
them
out
supplies
about
every
so
often
and
on
one
trip
he
begged
my
folks
to
let
me
go
along
for
company
i
was
a
slim
slip
of
a
colt
about
fourteen
at
the
time
and
as
this
man
was
a
friend
of
ours
my
folks
consented
to
let
me
go
along
we
each
had
a
good
saddle
horse
and
two
pack
mules
with
provisions
and
ammunition
for
the
hunting
camp
the
first
night
we
made
camp
a
boy
overtook
us
with
the
news
that
the
brother
of
my
companion
had
been
accidentally
killed
by
a
horse
and
of
course
he
would
have
to
return
well
we
were
twenty
miles
on
our
way
and
as
it
would
take
some
little
time
to
go
back
and
return
with
the
loaded
mules
i
volunteered
like
a
fool
kid
to
go
on
and
take
the
packs
through
the
only
question
was
could
i
pack
and
unpack
i
had
helped
him
at
this
work
but
now
that
i
was
to
try
it
alone
he
showed
me
what
he
called
a
squaw
hitch
with
which
you
can
lash
a
pack
after
putting
me
through
it
once
or
twice
and
satisfying
himself
that
i
could
do
the
packing
he
consented
to
let
me
go
on
he
and
the
messenger
returning
home
during
the
night
the
next
morning
i
packed
without
any
trouble
and
started
on
my
way
it
would
take
me
two
days
yet
poking
along
with
heavy
packs
to
reach
the
hunters
well
i
had
made
over
eight
or
ten
miles
the
first
morning
when
as
i
rounded
a
turn
in
the
trail
a
man
stepped
out
from
behind
a
rock
threw
a
gun
in
my
face
and
ordered
me
to
hold
up
my
hands
then
another
appeared
from
the
opposite
side
with
his
gun
leveled
on
me
inside
of
half
a
minute
a
dozen
men
galloped
up
from
every
quarter
all
armed
to
the
teeth
the
man
on
leaving
had
given
me
his
gun
for
company
one
of
these
old
but
i
must
have
forgotten
what
guns
were
for
for
i
elevated
my
little
hands
nicely
the
leader
of
the
party
questioned
me
as
to
who
i
was
and
what
i
was
doing
there
and
what
i
had
in
those
packs
that
once
at
least
i
told
the
truth
every
mother
son
of
them
was
cursing
and
me
in
the
same
breath
they
ordered
me
off
my
horse
took
my
gun
and
proceeded
to
verify
my
tale
by
unpacking
the
mules
so
much
ammunition
aroused
their
suspicions
but
my
story
was
as
good
as
it
was
true
and
they
never
shook
me
from
the
truth
of
it
i
soon
learned
that
robbery
was
not
their
motive
and
the
leader
explained
the
situation
a
vigilance
committee
had
been
in
force
in
that
county
for
some
time
trying
to
rid
the
country
of
lawless
characters
but
lawlessness
got
into
the
saddle
and
had
bench
warrants
issued
and
served
on
every
member
of
this
vigilance
committee
as
the
vigilantes
numbered
several
hundred
there
was
no
jail
large
enough
to
hold
such
a
number
so
they
were
released
on
parole
for
appearance
at
court
when
court
met
every
man
served
with
a
capias
hold
on
hold
your
horses
just
a
minute
interrupted
quince
forrest
i
want
to
get
that
word
i
want
to
make
a
memorandum
of
it
for
i
may
want
to
use
it
myself
sometime
capias
now
i
have
it
go
ahead
when
court
met
every
man
served
with
a
bench
warrant
from
the
judge
presiding
was
present
and
as
soon
as
court
was
called
to
order
a
squad
of
men
arose
in
the
court
room
and
the
next
moment
the
judge
fell
riddled
with
lead
then
the
factions
scattered
to
fight
it
out
and
i
was
passing
through
the
county
while
matters
were
active
they
confiscated
my
gun
and
all
the
ammunition
in
the
packs
but
helped
me
to
repack
and
started
me
on
my
way
a
happy
thought
struck
one
of
the
men
to
give
me
a
letter
which
would
carry
me
through
without
further
trouble
but
the
leader
stopped
him
saying
the
boy
alone
your
letter
would
hang
him
as
sure
as
hell
hot
before
he
went
ten
miles
farther
i
declined
the
letter
even
then
i
have
sense
enough
to
turn
back
and
inside
of
two
hours
i
was
rounded
up
by
the
other
faction
i
had
learned
my
story
perfectly
by
this
time
but
those
packs
had
to
come
off
again
for
everything
to
be
examined
there
was
nothing
in
them
now
but
flour
and
salt
and
such
things
nothing
that
they
might
consider
suspicious
one
fellow
in
this
second
party
took
a
fancy
to
my
horse
and
offered
to
help
hang
me
on
general
principles
but
kinder
counsels
prevailed
they
also
helped
me
to
repack
and
i
started
on
once
more
before
i
reached
my
destination
the
following
evening
i
was
held
up
seven
different
times
i
got
so
used
to
it
that
i
was
happily
disappointed
every
shelter
i
passed
if
some
man
did
not
step
out
and
throw
a
gun
in
my
face
i
had
trouble
to
convince
the
cattle
hunters
of
my
experiences
but
the
absence
of
any
ammunition
which
they
needed
worst
at
last
led
them
to
give
credit
to
my
tale
i
was
expected
home
within
a
week
as
i
was
to
go
down
on
the
nueces
on
a
cow
hunt
which
was
making
up
and
i
only
rested
one
day
at
the
hunters
camp
on
their
advice
i
took
a
different
route
on
my
way
home
leaving
the
mules
behind
me
i
never
saw
a
man
the
next
day
returning
and
was
feeling
quite
gala
on
my
good
fortune
when
evening
came
on
i
sighted
a
little
ranch
house
some
distance
off
the
trail
and
concluded
to
ride
to
it
and
stay
overnight
as
i
approached
i
saw
that
some
one
lived
there
as
there
were
chickens
and
dogs
about
but
not
a
person
in
sight
i
dismounted
and
knocked
on
the
door
when
without
a
word
the
door
was
thrown
wide
open
and
a
half
dozen
guns
were
poked
into
my
face
i
was
ordered
into
the
house
and
given
a
chance
to
tell
my
story
again
whether
my
story
was
true
or
not
they
took
no
chances
on
me
but
kept
me
all
night
one
of
the
men
took
my
horse
to
the
stable
and
cared
for
him
and
i
was
well
fed
and
given
a
place
to
sleep
but
not
a
man
offered
a
word
of
explanation
from
which
i
took
it
they
did
not
belong
to
the
vigilance
faction
when
it
came
time
to
go
to
bed
one
man
said
to
me
sonny
do
make
any
attempt
to
get
away
and
do
move
out
of
your
bed
without
warning
us
for
you
be
shot
as
sure
as
you
do
we
wo
harm
a
hair
on
your
head
if
you
telling
us
the
truth
only
do
as
you
told
for
we
watch
you
by
this
time
i
had
learned
to
obey
orders
while
in
that
county
and
got
a
fair
night
sleep
though
there
were
men
going
and
coming
all
night
the
next
morning
i
was
given
my
breakfast
my
horse
well
cuffed
and
saddled
was
brought
to
the
door
and
with
this
parting
advice
i
was
given
permission
to
go
if
you
told
us
the
truth
do
look
back
when
you
ride
away
you
be
watched
for
the
first
ten
miles
after
leaving
here
and
if
you
lied
to
us
it
will
go
hard
with
you
now
remember
do
look
back
for
these
are
times
when
no
one
cares
to
be
identified
i
never
questioned
that
advice
it
was
dog
or
eat
the
hatchet
with
me
i
mounted
my
horse
waved
the
usual
parting
courtesies
and
rode
away
as
i
turned
into
the
trail
about
a
quarter
mile
from
the
house
i
noticed
two
men
ride
out
from
behind
the
stable
and
follow
me
i
remembered
the
story
about
lot
wife
looking
back
though
it
was
lead
and
not
miracles
that
i
was
afraid
of
that
morning
for
the
first
hour
i
could
hear
the
men
talking
and
the
hoofbeats
of
their
horses
as
they
rode
along
always
the
same
distance
behind
me
after
about
two
hours
of
this
joke
as
i
rode
over
a
little
hill
i
looked
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
back
at
my
escort
still
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
behind
me
one
of
them
noticed
me
and
raised
his
gun
but
i
instantly
changed
my
view
and
the
moment
the
hill
hid
me
put
spurs
to
my
horse
so
that
when
they
reached
the
brow
of
the
hill
i
was
half
a
mile
in
the
lead
burning
the
earth
like
a
canned
dog
they
threw
lead
close
around
me
but
my
horse
lengthened
the
distance
between
us
for
the
next
five
miles
when
they
dropped
entirely
out
of
sight
by
noon
i
came
into
the
old
stage
road
and
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
reached
home
after
over
sixty
miles
in
the
saddle
without
a
halt
just
at
the
conclusion
of
bull
story
flood
rode
in
from
the
herd
and
after
picketing
his
horse
joined
the
circle
in
reply
to
an
inquiry
from
one
of
the
boys
as
to
how
the
cattle
were
resting
he
replied
this
herd
is
breaking
into
trail
life
nicely
if
we
just
be
careful
with
them
now
for
the
first
month
and
no
bad
storms
strike
us
in
the
night
we
may
never
have
a
run
the
entire
trip
that
last
drink
of
water
they
had
this
evening
gave
them
a
that
last
them
until
morning
no
there
no
danger
of
any
trouble
for
fully
an
hour
after
the
return
of
our
foreman
we
lounged
around
the
fire
during
which
there
was
a
full
and
free
discussion
of
stampedes
but
finally
flood
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
by
arising
suggested
that
all
hands
hunt
their
blankets
and
turn
in
for
the
night
a
quiet
wink
from
bull
to
several
of
the
boys
held
us
for
the
time
being
and
innocently
turning
to
forrest
durham
inquired
where
was
when
was
was
it
you
that
was
telling
some
one
about
a
run
you
were
in
last
summer
i
never
heard
you
tell
it
where
was
it
you
mean
on
the
cimarron
last
year
when
we
mixed
two
herds
said
quince
who
had
taken
the
bait
like
a
bass
and
was
now
fully
embarked
on
a
yarn
we
were
in
rather
close
quarters
herds
ahead
and
behind
us
when
one
night
here
came
a
cow
herd
like
a
cyclone
and
swept
right
through
our
camp
we
tumbled
out
of
our
blankets
and
ran
for
our
horses
but
before
we
could
bridle
bull
had
given
us
the
wink
and
every
man
in
the
outfit
fell
back
and
the
snoring
that
checked
the
storyteller
was
like
a
chorus
of
rip
saws
running
through
pine
knots
forrest
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
and
as
he
arose
to
leave
looked
back
and
remarked
you
must
all
think
that
smart
before
he
was
out
of
hearing
durham
said
to
the
rest
of
us
a
few
doses
like
that
will
cure
him
of
sucking
eggs
and
acting
smart
interrupting
folks
chapter
iv
the
atascosa
for
the
next
few
days
we
paralleled
the
coast
except
when
forced
inland
by
various
arms
of
the
laguna
madre
when
about
a
week
out
from
the
arroyo
colorado
we
encountered
the
salt
lagoon
which
threw
us
at
least
fifty
miles
in
from
the
coast
here
we
had
our
last
view
of
salt
water
and
the
murmurings
of
the
gulf
were
heard
no
more
our
route
now
led
northward
through
what
were
then
the
two
largest
ranches
in
texas
the
running
w
and
laurel
leaf
which
sent
more
cattle
up
the
trail
bred
in
their
own
brand
than
any
other
four
ranches
in
the
lone
star
state
we
were
nearly
a
week
passing
through
their
ranges
and
on
reaching
santa
gertruda
ranch
learned
that
three
trail
herds
of
over
three
thousand
head
each
had
already
started
in
these
two
brands
while
four
more
were
to
follow
so
far
we
had
been
having
splendid
luck
in
securing
water
for
the
herd
once
a
day
at
least
and
often
twice
and
three
times
our
herd
was
becoming
well
by
this
time
and
for
range
cattle
had
quieted
down
and
were
docile
and
easy
to
handle
flood
years
of
experience
on
the
trail
made
him
a
believer
in
the
theory
that
stampedes
were
generally
due
to
negligence
in
not
having
the
herd
full
of
grass
and
water
on
reaching
the
bed
ground
at
night
barring
accidents
which
will
happen
his
view
is
the
correct
one
if
care
has
been
used
for
the
first
few
weeks
in
properly
breaking
the
herd
to
the
trail
but
though
hunger
and
thirst
are
probably
responsible
for
more
stampedes
than
all
other
causes
combined
it
is
the
unexpected
which
can
not
be
guarded
against
a
stampede
is
the
natural
result
of
fear
and
at
night
or
in
an
uncertain
light
this
timidity
might
be
imparted
to
an
entire
herd
by
a
flash
of
lightning
or
a
peal
of
thunder
while
the
stumbling
of
a
night
horse
or
the
scent
of
some
wild
animal
would
in
a
moment
time
from
frightening
a
few
head
so
infect
a
herd
as
to
throw
them
into
the
wildest
panic
amongst
the
thousands
of
herds
like
ours
which
were
driven
over
the
trail
during
its
brief
existence
none
ever
made
the
trip
without
encountering
more
or
less
trouble
from
runs
frequently
a
herd
became
so
spoiled
in
this
manner
that
it
grew
into
a
mania
with
them
so
that
they
would
stampede
on
the
slightest
provocation
or
no
provocation
at
all
a
few
days
after
leaving
santa
gertruda
ranch
we
crossed
the
nueces
river
which
we
followed
up
for
several
days
keeping
in
touch
with
it
for
water
for
the
herd
but
the
nueces
after
passing
oakville
makes
an
abrupt
turn
doubling
back
to
the
southwest
and
the
atascosa
one
of
its
tributaries
became
our
source
of
water
supply
we
were
beginning
to
feel
a
degree
of
overconfidence
in
the
good
behavior
of
our
herd
when
one
night
during
the
third
week
out
an
incident
occurred
in
which
they
displayed
their
running
qualities
to
our
complete
satisfaction
it
occurred
during
our
guard
and
about
two
in
the
morning
the
night
was
an
unusually
dark
one
and
the
atmosphere
was
very
humid
after
we
had
been
on
guard
possibly
an
hour
john
officer
and
i
riding
in
one
direction
on
opposite
sides
of
the
herd
and
the
rebel
circling
in
the
opposite
officer
horse
suddenly
struck
a
gopher
burrow
with
his
front
feet
and
in
a
moment
horse
and
rider
were
sprawling
on
the
ground
the
accident
happened
but
a
few
rods
from
the
sleeping
herd
which
instantly
came
to
their
feet
as
one
steer
and
were
off
like
a
flash
i
was
riding
my
nigger
boy
and
as
the
cattle
headed
toward
me
away
from
the
cause
of
their
fright
i
had
to
use
both
quirt
and
rowel
to
keep
clear
of
the
onrush
fortunately
we
had
a
clear
country
near
the
bed
ground
and
while
the
terrified
cattle
pressed
me
close
my
horse
kept
the
lead
in
the
rumbling
which
ensued
all
sounds
were
submerged
by
the
general
din
and
i
was
only
brought
to
the
consciousness
that
i
was
not
alone
by
seeing
several
distinct
flashes
from
on
my
left
and
realizing
that
i
also
had
a
gun
fired
several
times
in
the
air
in
reply
i
was
soon
joined
by
priest
and
officer
the
latter
having
lost
no
time
in
regaining
his
seat
in
the
saddle
and
the
three
of
us
held
together
some
little
distance
for
it
would
have
been
useless
to
attempt
to
check
or
turn
this
onslaught
of
cattle
in
their
first
mad
rush
the
wagon
was
camped
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
bed
ground
and
the
herd
had
given
ample
warning
to
the
boys
asleep
so
that
if
we
three
could
hold
our
position
in
the
lead
help
would
come
to
us
as
soon
as
the
men
in
camp
could
reach
their
horses
realizing
the
wide
front
of
the
running
cattle
priest
sent
officer
to
the
left
and
myself
to
the
right
to
point
in
the
leaders
in
order
to
keep
the
herd
from
splitting
or
scattering
while
he
remained
in
the
centre
and
led
the
herd
i
soon
gained
the
outside
of
the
leaders
and
by
dropping
back
and
coming
up
the
line
pointed
them
in
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
had
repeated
this
a
number
of
times
even
quirting
some
cattle
along
the
outside
or
burning
a
little
powder
in
the
face
of
some
obstinate
leader
when
across
the
herd
and
to
the
rear
i
saw
a
succession
of
flashes
like
fireflies
which
told
me
the
boys
were
coming
to
our
assistance
running
is
not
a
natural
gait
with
cattle
and
if
we
could
only
hold
them
together
and
prevent
splitting
up
in
time
they
would
tire
while
the
rear
cattle
could
be
depended
on
to
follow
the
leaders
all
we
could
hope
to
do
was
to
force
them
to
run
straight
and
in
this
respect
we
were
succeeding
splendidly
though
to
a
certain
extent
it
was
a
guess
in
the
dark
when
they
had
run
possibly
a
mile
i
noticed
a
horseman
overtake
priest
after
they
had
ridden
together
a
moment
one
of
them
came
over
to
my
point
and
the
next
minute
our
foreman
was
racing
along
by
my
side
in
his
impatience
to
check
the
run
he
took
me
with
him
and
circling
the
leaders
we
reached
the
left
point
by
which
time
the
remainder
of
the
outfit
had
come
up
now
massing
our
numbers
we
fell
on
the
left
point
and
amid
the
flash
of
guns
deflected
their
course
for
a
few
moments
a
dozen
men
however
can
cover
but
a
small
space
and
we
soon
realized
that
we
had
turned
only
a
few
hundred
head
for
the
momentum
of
the
main
body
bore
steadily
ahead
abandoning
what
few
cattle
we
had
turned
which
owing
to
their
running
ability
soon
resumed
their
places
in
the
lead
we
attempted
to
turn
them
to
the
left
stretching
out
our
line
until
there
was
a
man
about
every
twenty
feet
we
threw
our
force
against
the
right
point
and
lead
in
the
hope
of
gradually
deviating
their
course
for
a
few
minutes
the
attempt
promised
to
be
successful
but
our
cordon
was
too
weak
and
the
cattle
went
through
between
the
riders
and
we
soon
found
a
portion
of
our
forces
on
either
side
of
the
herd
while
a
few
of
the
boys
were
riding
out
of
the
rush
in
the
lead
on
finding
our
forces
thus
divided
the
five
or
six
of
us
who
remained
on
the
right
contented
ourselves
by
pointing
in
the
leaders
for
the
cattle
so
far
as
we
could
tell
were
running
compactly
our
foreman
however
was
determined
to
turn
the
run
and
after
a
few
minutes
time
rejoined
us
on
the
right
when
under
his
leadership
we
circled
the
front
of
the
herd
and
collected
on
the
left
point
when
for
a
third
time
we
repeated
the
same
tactics
in
our
efforts
to
turn
the
stampede
but
in
this
which
was
our
final
effort
we
were
attempting
to
turn
them
slowly
and
on
a
much
larger
circle
and
with
a
promise
of
success
suddenly
in
the
dark
we
encountered
a
mesquite
thicket
into
which
the
lead
cattle
tore
with
a
crashing
of
brush
and
a
rattle
of
horns
that
sent
a
chill
up
and
down
my
spine
but
there
was
no
time
to
hesitate
for
our
horses
were
in
the
thicket
and
with
the
herd
closing
in
on
us
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
go
through
it
every
man
for
himself
i
gave
nigger
a
free
rein
shutting
my
eyes
and
clutching
both
cantle
and
pommel
to
hold
my
seat
the
black
responded
to
the
rowel
and
tore
through
the
thicket
in
places
higher
than
my
head
and
came
out
in
an
open
space
considerably
in
the
lead
of
the
cattle
this
thicket
must
have
been
eight
or
ten
rods
wide
and
checked
the
run
to
a
slight
extent
but
as
they
emerged
from
it
they
came
out
in
scattering
flies
and
resumed
their
running
being
alone
and
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
i
rode
to
the
right
and
front
and
soon
found
myself
in
the
lead
of
quite
a
string
of
cattle
nigger
and
i
were
piloting
them
where
they
listed
when
joe
stallings
hatless
himself
and
his
horse
heaving
overtook
me
and
the
two
of
us
gave
those
lead
cattle
all
the
trouble
we
knew
how
but
we
did
not
attempt
to
turn
them
for
they
had
caught
their
wind
in
forcing
the
thicket
and
were
running
an
easy
stroke
several
times
we
worried
the
leaders
into
a
trot
but
as
other
cattle
in
the
rear
came
up
we
were
compelled
to
loosen
out
and
allow
them
to
resume
their
running
or
they
would
have
scattered
on
us
like
partridges
at
this
stage
of
the
run
we
had
no
idea
where
the
rest
of
the
outfit
were
but
both
of
us
were
satisfied
the
herd
had
scattered
on
leaving
the
mesquite
thicket
and
were
possibly
then
running
in
half
a
dozen
bunches
like
the
one
we
were
with
stallings
horse
was
badly
winded
and
on
my
suggestion
he
dropped
out
on
one
side
to
try
to
get
some
idea
how
many
cattle
we
were
leading
he
was
gone
some
little
time
and
as
nigger
cantered
along
easily
in
the
lead
i
managed
to
eject
the
shells
from
my
and
refill
the
cylinder
on
joe
overtaking
me
again
he
reported
that
there
was
a
slender
column
of
cattle
half
a
mile
in
length
following
as
one
man
could
easily
lead
this
string
of
the
herd
until
daybreak
i
left
stallings
with
them
and
rode
out
to
the
left
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
mile
listening
to
hear
if
there
were
any
cattle
running
to
the
left
of
those
we
were
leading
it
took
me
but
a
few
minutes
to
satisfy
myself
that
ours
was
the
outside
band
on
the
left
and
after
i
rejoined
joe
we
made
an
effort
to
check
our
holding
there
were
about
fifty
or
sixty
big
steers
in
the
lead
of
our
bunch
and
after
worrying
them
into
a
trot
we
opened
in
their
front
with
our
shooting
into
the
ground
in
their
very
faces
and
were
rewarded
by
having
them
turn
tail
and
head
the
other
way
taking
advantage
of
the
moment
we
jumped
our
horses
on
the
retreating
leaders
and
as
fast
as
the
rear
cattle
forged
forward
easily
turned
them
leaving
joe
to
turn
the
rear
as
they
came
up
i
rode
to
the
lead
unfastening
my
slicker
as
i
went
and
on
reaching
the
turned
leaders
who
were
running
on
an
angle
from
their
former
course
flaunted
my
fish
in
their
faces
until
they
reentered
the
rear
guard
of
our
string
and
we
soon
had
a
mill
going
which
kept
them
busy
and
rested
our
horses
once
we
had
them
milling
our
trouble
as
far
as
running
was
concerned
was
over
for
all
two
of
us
could
hope
to
do
was
to
let
them
exhaust
themselves
in
this
endless
circle
it
then
lacked
an
hour
of
daybreak
and
all
we
could
do
was
to
ride
around
and
wait
for
daylight
in
the
darkness
preceding
dawn
we
had
no
idea
of
the
number
of
our
bunch
except
as
we
could
judge
from
the
size
and
compactness
of
the
milling
cattle
which
must
have
covered
an
acre
or
more
the
humidity
of
the
atmosphere
which
had
prevailed
during
the
night
by
dawn
had
changed
until
a
heavy
fog
cutting
off
our
view
on
every
hand
left
us
as
much
at
sea
as
we
had
been
previously
but
with
the
break
of
day
we
rode
through
our
holding
a
number
of
times
splitting
and
scattering
the
milling
cattle
and
as
the
light
of
day
brightened
we
saw
them
quiet
down
and
go
to
grazing
as
though
they
had
just
arisen
from
the
bed
ground
it
was
over
an
hour
before
the
fog
lifted
sufficiently
to
give
us
any
idea
as
to
our
whereabouts
and
during
the
interim
both
stallings
and
myself
rode
to
the
nearest
elevation
firing
a
number
of
shots
in
the
hope
of
getting
an
answer
from
the
outfit
but
we
had
no
response
when
the
sun
was
sufficiently
high
to
scatter
the
mists
which
hung
in
clouds
there
was
not
an
object
in
sight
by
which
we
could
determine
our
location
whether
we
had
run
east
west
or
south
during
the
night
neither
of
us
knew
though
both
stallings
and
myself
were
satisfied
that
we
had
never
crossed
the
trail
and
all
we
did
know
for
a
certainty
was
that
we
had
between
six
and
seven
hundred
head
of
cattle
stallings
had
lost
his
hat
and
i
had
one
sleeve
missing
and
both
outside
pockets
torn
out
of
my
coat
while
the
mesquite
thorns
had
left
their
marks
on
the
faces
of
both
of
us
one
particularly
ugly
cut
marking
joe
right
temple
i
worn
leggins
for
the
last
ten
years
said
stallings
to
me
as
we
took
an
inventory
of
our
disfigurements
and
for
about
ten
seconds
in
forcing
that
mesquite
thicket
was
the
only
time
i
ever
drew
interest
on
my
investment
they
a
heap
like
a
wear
them
all
your
life
and
never
have
any
use
for
them
with
a
cigarette
for
breakfast
i
left
joe
to
look
after
our
bunch
and
after
riding
several
miles
to
the
right
cut
the
trail
of
quite
a
band
of
cattle
in
following
up
this
trail
i
could
easily
see
that
some
one
was
in
their
lead
as
they
failed
to
hold
their
course
in
any
one
direction
for
any
distance
as
free
cattle
would
after
following
this
trail
about
three
miles
i
sighted
the
band
of
cattle
and
on
overtaking
them
found
two
of
our
boys
holding
about
half
as
many
as
stallings
had
they
reported
that
the
rebel
and
bob
blades
had
been
with
them
until
daybreak
but
having
the
freshest
horses
had
left
them
with
the
dawn
and
ridden
away
to
the
right
where
it
was
supposed
the
main
body
of
the
herd
had
run
as
stallings
bunch
was
some
three
or
four
miles
to
the
rear
and
left
of
this
band
wyatt
roundtree
suggested
that
he
go
and
pilot
in
joe
cattle
as
he
felt
positive
that
the
main
body
were
somewhere
to
our
right
on
getting
directions
from
me
as
to
where
he
would
find
our
holding
he
rode
away
and
i
again
rode
off
to
the
right
leaving
rod
wheat
with
their
catch
the
sun
was
now
several
hours
high
and
as
my
black
strength
was
standing
the
test
bravely
i
the
country
and
was
soon
on
another
trail
of
our
stampeded
cattle
but
in
following
this
trail
i
soon
noticed
two
other
horsemen
preceding
me
knowing
that
my
services
would
be
too
late
i
only
followed
far
enough
to
satisfy
myself
of
the
fact
the
signs
left
by
the
running
cattle
were
as
easy
to
follow
as
a
public
road
and
in
places
where
the
ground
was
sandy
the
sod
was
cut
up
as
if
a
regiment
of
cavalry
had
charged
across
it
on
again
bearing
off
to
the
right
i
rode
for
an
elevation
which
ought
to
give
me
a
good
view
of
the
country
slight
as
this
elevation
was
on
reaching
it
i
made
out
a
large
band
of
cattle
under
herd
and
as
i
was
on
the
point
of
riding
to
them
saw
our
wagon
and
saddle
horses
heave
in
sight
from
a
northwest
quarter
supposing
they
were
following
up
the
largest
trail
i
rode
for
the
herd
where
flood
and
two
of
the
boys
had
about
twelve
hundred
cattle
from
a
comparison
of
notes
our
foreman
was
able
to
account
for
all
the
men
with
the
exception
of
two
and
as
these
proved
to
be
blades
and
priest
i
could
give
him
a
satisfactory
explanation
as
to
their
probable
whereabouts
on
my
report
of
having
sighted
the
wagon
and
flood
at
once
ordered
me
to
meet
and
hurry
them
in
as
not
only
he
but
strayhorn
and
officer
were
badly
in
need
of
a
change
of
mounts
i
learned
from
mccann
who
was
doing
the
trailing
from
the
wagon
that
the
regular
trail
was
to
the
west
the
herd
having
crossed
it
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
after
leaving
the
bed
ground
joining
honeyman
i
took
the
first
horse
which
came
within
reach
of
my
rope
and
with
a
fresh
mount
under
me
we
rushed
the
saddle
horses
past
the
wagon
and
shortly
came
up
with
our
foreman
there
we
rounded
in
the
horses
as
best
we
could
without
the
aid
of
the
wagon
and
before
mccann
arrived
all
had
fresh
mounts
and
were
ready
for
orders
this
was
my
first
trip
on
the
trail
and
i
was
hungry
and
thirsty
enough
to
hope
something
would
be
said
about
eating
but
that
seemed
to
be
the
last
idea
in
our
foreman
mind
instead
he
ordered
me
to
take
the
two
other
boys
with
me
and
after
putting
them
on
the
trail
of
the
bunch
which
the
rebel
and
blades
were
following
to
drift
in
what
cattle
we
had
held
on
our
left
but
as
we
went
we
managed
to
encounter
the
wagon
and
get
a
drink
and
a
canteen
of
water
from
mccann
before
we
galloped
away
on
our
mission
after
riding
a
mile
or
so
together
we
separated
and
on
my
arrival
at
the
nearest
bunch
i
found
roundtree
and
stallings
coming
up
with
the
larger
holding
throwing
the
two
hunches
together
we
drifted
them
a
free
clip
towards
camp
we
soon
sighted
the
main
herd
and
saw
across
to
our
right
and
about
five
miles
distant
two
of
our
men
bringing
in
another
hunch
as
soon
as
we
turned
our
cattle
into
the
herd
flood
ordered
me
on
account
of
my
light
weight
to
meet
this
bunch
find
out
where
the
last
cattle
were
and
go
to
their
assistance
with
a
hungry
look
in
the
direction
of
our
wagon
i
obeyed
and
on
meeting
durham
and
borrowstone
learned
that
the
outside
bunch
on
the
right
which
had
got
into
the
regular
trail
had
not
been
checked
until
daybreak
all
they
knew
about
their
location
was
that
the
up
stage
from
oakville
had
seen
two
men
with
circle
dot
cattle
about
five
miles
below
and
had
sent
up
word
by
the
driver
that
they
had
something
like
four
hundred
head
with
this
meagre
information
i
rode
away
in
the
direction
where
one
would
naturally
expect
to
find
our
absent
men
and
after
scouring
the
country
for
an
hour
sighted
a
single
horseman
on
an
elevation
whom
from
the
gray
mount
i
knew
for
quince
forrest
he
was
evidently
on
the
lookout
for
some
one
to
pilot
them
in
they
had
been
drifting
like
lost
sheep
ever
since
dawn
but
we
soon
had
their
cattle
pointed
in
the
right
direction
and
forrest
taking
the
lead
quarternight
and
i
put
the
necessary
push
behind
them
both
of
them
cursed
me
roundly
for
not
bringing
them
a
canteen
of
water
though
they
were
well
aware
that
in
an
emergency
like
the
present
our
foreman
would
never
give
a
thought
to
anything
but
the
recovery
of
the
herd
our
comfort
was
nothing
men
were
cheap
but
cattle
cost
money
we
reached
the
camp
about
two
and
found
the
outfit
cutting
out
range
cattle
which
had
been
absorbed
into
the
herd
during
the
run
throwing
in
our
contingent
we
joined
in
the
work
and
though
forrest
and
quarternight
were
as
good
as
afoot
there
were
no
orders
for
a
change
of
mounts
to
say
nothing
of
food
and
drink
several
hundred
mixed
cattle
were
in
the
herd
and
after
they
had
been
cut
out
we
lined
our
cattle
out
for
a
count
in
the
absence
of
priest
flood
and
john
officer
did
the
counting
and
as
the
hour
of
the
day
made
the
cattle
sluggish
they
lined
through
between
the
counters
as
though
they
had
never
done
anything
but
walk
in
their
lives
the
count
showed
sixteen
short
of
hundred
which
left
us
yet
over
three
hundred
out
but
good
men
were
on
their
trail
and
leaving
two
men
on
herd
the
rest
of
us
obeyed
the
most
welcome
orders
of
the
day
when
flood
intimated
that
we
would
eat
a
bite
and
go
after
the
rest
as
we
had
been
in
our
saddles
since
one
or
two
the
morning
before
it
is
needless
to
add
that
our
appetites
were
equal
to
the
spread
which
our
cook
had
waiting
for
us
our
foreman
as
though
fearful
of
the
loss
of
a
moment
time
sent
honeyman
to
rustle
in
the
horses
before
we
had
finished
our
dinners
once
the
was
corralled
under
the
rush
of
a
tireless
foreman
dinner
was
quickly
over
and
fresh
horses
became
the
order
of
the
moment
the
atascosa
our
nearest
water
lay
beyond
the
regular
trail
to
the
west
and
leaving
orders
for
the
outfit
to
drift
the
herd
into
it
and
water
flood
and
myself
started
in
search
of
our
absent
men
not
forgetting
to
take
along
two
extra
horses
as
a
remount
for
blades
and
priest
the
leading
of
these
extra
horses
fell
to
me
but
with
the
loose
end
of
a
rope
in
jim
flood
hand
as
he
followed
it
took
fast
riding
to
keep
clear
of
them
after
reaching
the
trail
of
the
missing
cattle
our
foreman
set
a
pace
for
five
or
six
miles
which
would
have
carried
us
across
the
nueces
by
nightfall
and
we
were
only
checked
by
moss
strayhorn
riding
in
on
an
angle
and
intercepting
us
in
our
headlong
gait
the
missing
cattle
were
within
a
mile
of
us
to
the
right
and
we
turned
and
rode
to
them
strayhorn
explained
to
us
that
the
cattle
had
struck
some
recent
fencing
on
their
course
and
after
following
down
the
fence
several
miles
had
encountered
an
offset
and
the
angle
had
held
the
squad
until
the
rebel
and
blades
overtook
them
when
officer
and
he
reached
them
they
were
unable
to
make
any
accurate
count
because
of
the
range
cattle
amongst
them
and
they
had
considered
it
advisable
to
save
horseflesh
and
not
cut
them
until
more
help
was
available
when
we
came
up
with
the
cattle
my
bunkie
and
blades
looked
wistfully
at
our
saddles
and
anticipating
their
want
i
untied
my
slicker
well
remembering
the
reproof
of
quarternight
and
forrest
and
produced
a
full
canteen
of
water
warm
of
course
but
no
less
welcome
no
sooner
were
saddles
shifted
than
we
held
up
the
bunch
cut
out
the
range
cattle
counted
and
found
we
had
some
three
hundred
and
thirty
odd
circle
dots
our
number
more
than
complete
with
nothing
now
missing
flood
took
the
loose
horses
and
two
of
the
boys
with
him
and
returned
to
the
herd
leaving
three
of
us
behind
to
bring
in
this
last
contingent
of
our
stampeded
cattle
this
squad
were
nearly
all
large
steers
and
had
run
fully
twenty
miles
before
thanks
to
an
angle
in
a
fence
they
had
been
checked
as
our
foreman
galloped
away
leaving
us
behind
bob
blades
said
has
the
boss
got
a
wiggle
on
himself
today
if
he
made
this
old
world
he
have
made
it
in
half
a
day
and
gone
fishing
in
the
afternoon
if
his
horses
had
held
out
we
reached
the
atascosa
shortly
after
the
arrival
of
the
herd
and
after
holding
the
cattle
on
the
water
for
an
hour
grazed
them
the
remainder
of
the
evening
for
if
there
was
any
virtue
in
their
having
full
stomachs
we
wanted
to
benefit
from
it
while
grazing
that
evening
we
recrossed
the
trail
on
an
angle
and
camped
in
the
most
open
country
we
could
find
about
ten
miles
below
our
camp
of
the
night
before
every
precaution
was
taken
to
prevent
a
repetition
of
the
run
our
best
horses
were
chosen
for
night
duty
as
our
regular
ones
were
too
exhausted
every
advantage
of
elevation
for
a
bed
ground
was
secured
and
thus
fortified
against
accident
we
went
into
camp
for
the
night
but
the
expected
never
happens
on
the
trail
and
the
sun
arose
the
next
morning
over
our
herd
grazing
in
peace
and
contentment
on
the
flowery
prairies
which
border
on
the
atascosa
chapter
v
a
dry
drive
our
cattle
quieted
down
nicely
after
this
run
and
the
next
few
weeks
brought
not
an
incident
worth
recording
there
was
no
regular
trail
through
the
lower
counties
so
we
simply
kept
to
the
open
country
spring
had
advanced
until
the
prairies
were
swarded
with
grass
and
flowers
while
water
though
scarcer
was
to
be
had
at
least
once
daily
we
passed
to
the
west
of
san
antonio
an
outfitting
point
which
all
herds
touched
in
passing
northward
and
flood
and
our
cook
took
the
wagon
and
went
in
for
supplies
but
the
outfit
with
the
herd
kept
on
now
launched
on
a
broad
trail
in
places
yards
wide
where
all
local
trails
blent
into
the
one
common
pathway
known
in
those
days
as
the
old
western
trail
it
is
not
in
the
province
of
this
narrative
to
deal
with
the
cause
or
origin
of
this
cattle
trail
though
it
marked
the
passage
of
many
hundred
thousand
cattle
which
preceded
our
circle
dots
and
was
destined
to
afford
an
outlet
to
several
millions
more
to
follow
the
trail
proper
consisted
of
many
scores
of
irregular
cow
paths
united
into
one
broad
passageway
narrowing
and
widening
as
conditions
permitted
yet
ever
leading
northward
after
a
few
years
of
continued
use
it
became
as
well
defined
as
the
course
of
a
river
several
herds
which
had
started
farther
up
country
were
ahead
of
ours
and
this
we
considered
an
advantage
for
wherever
one
herd
could
go
it
was
reasonable
that
others
could
follow
flood
knew
the
trail
as
well
as
any
of
the
other
foremen
but
there
was
one
thing
he
had
not
taken
into
consideration
the
drouth
of
the
preceding
summer
true
there
had
been
local
spring
showers
sufficient
to
start
the
grass
nicely
but
water
in
such
quantities
as
we
needed
was
growing
daily
more
difficult
to
find
the
first
week
after
leaving
san
antonio
our
foreman
scouted
in
quest
of
water
a
full
day
in
advance
of
the
herd
one
evening
he
returned
to
us
with
the
news
that
we
were
in
for
a
dry
drive
for
after
passing
the
next
chain
of
lakes
it
was
sixty
miles
to
the
next
water
and
reports
regarding
the
water
supply
even
after
crossing
this
arid
stretch
were
very
conflicting
while
i
know
every
foot
of
this
trail
through
here
said
the
foreman
there
several
things
that
look
scaly
there
are
only
five
herds
ahead
of
us
and
the
first
three
went
through
the
old
route
but
the
last
two
after
passing
indian
lakes
for
some
reason
or
other
turned
and
went
westward
these
last
herds
may
be
stock
cattle
pushing
out
west
to
new
ranges
but
i
do
like
the
outlook
it
would
take
me
two
days
to
ride
across
and
back
and
by
that
time
we
could
be
two
thirds
of
the
way
through
i
made
this
drive
before
without
a
drop
of
water
on
the
way
and
would
dread
it
now
if
there
was
any
certainty
of
water
at
the
other
end
i
reckon
there
nothing
to
do
but
tackle
her
but
is
this
a
hell
of
a
country
i
ridden
fifty
miles
and
never
saw
a
soul
the
indian
lakes
some
seven
in
number
were
natural
reservoirs
with
rocky
bottoms
and
about
a
mile
apart
we
watered
at
ten
the
next
day
and
by
night
camped
fifteen
miles
on
our
way
there
was
plenty
of
good
grazing
for
the
cattle
and
horses
and
no
trouble
was
experienced
the
first
night
mccann
had
filled
an
extra
twenty
gallon
keg
for
this
trip
water
was
too
precious
an
article
to
be
lavish
with
so
we
shook
the
dust
from
our
clothing
and
went
unwashed
this
was
no
serious
deprivation
and
no
one
could
be
critical
of
another
for
we
were
all
equally
dusty
and
dirty
the
next
morning
by
daybreak
the
cattle
were
thrown
off
the
bed
ground
and
started
grazing
before
the
sun
could
dry
out
what
little
moisture
the
grass
had
absorbed
during
the
night
the
heat
of
the
past
week
had
been
very
oppressive
and
in
order
to
avoid
it
as
much
as
possible
we
made
late
and
early
drives
before
the
wagon
passed
the
herd
during
the
morning
drive
what
few
canteens
we
had
were
filled
with
water
for
the
men
the
was
kept
with
the
herd
and
four
changes
of
mounts
were
made
during
the
day
in
order
not
to
exhaust
any
one
horse
several
times
for
an
hour
or
more
the
herd
was
allowed
to
lie
down
and
rest
but
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
thirst
made
them
impatient
and
restless
and
the
point
men
were
compelled
to
ride
steadily
in
the
lead
in
order
to
hold
the
cattle
to
a
walk
a
number
of
times
during
the
afternoon
we
attempted
to
graze
them
but
not
until
the
twilight
of
evening
was
it
possible
after
the
fourth
change
of
horses
was
made
honeyman
pushed
on
ahead
with
the
saddle
stock
and
overtook
the
wagon
under
flood
orders
he
was
to
tie
up
all
the
night
horses
for
if
the
cattle
could
be
induced
to
graze
we
would
not
bed
them
down
before
ten
that
night
and
all
hands
would
be
required
with
the
herd
mccann
had
instructions
to
make
camp
on
the
divide
which
was
known
to
be
miles
from
our
camp
of
the
night
before
or
forty
miles
from
the
indian
lakes
as
we
expected
the
cattle
grazed
willingly
after
nightfall
and
with
a
fair
moon
we
allowed
them
to
scatter
freely
while
grazing
forward
the
beacon
of
mccann
fire
on
the
divide
was
in
sight
over
an
hour
before
the
herd
grazed
up
to
camp
all
hands
remaining
to
bed
the
thirsty
cattle
the
herd
was
given
triple
the
amount
of
space
usually
required
for
bedding
and
even
then
for
nearly
an
hour
scarcely
half
of
them
lay
down
we
were
handling
the
cattle
as
humanely
as
possible
under
the
circumstances
the
guards
for
the
night
were
doubled
six
men
on
the
first
half
and
the
same
on
the
latter
bob
blades
being
detailed
to
assist
honeyman
in
the
saddle
horses
if
any
of
us
got
more
than
an
hour
sleep
that
night
he
was
lucky
flood
mccann
and
the
horse
wranglers
did
not
even
try
to
rest
to
those
of
us
who
could
find
time
to
eat
our
cook
kept
open
house
our
foreman
knew
that
a
man
can
stand
an
incredible
amount
of
hardship
and
appreciated
the
fact
that
on
the
trail
a
good
cook
is
a
valuable
asset
our
outfit
therefore
was
cheerful
to
a
man
and
jokes
and
songs
helped
to
while
away
the
weary
hours
of
the
night
the
second
guard
under
flood
pushed
the
cattle
off
their
beds
an
hour
before
dawn
and
before
they
were
relieved
had
urged
the
herd
more
than
five
miles
on
the
third
day
drive
over
this
waterless
mesa
in
spite
of
our
economy
of
water
after
breakfast
on
this
third
morning
there
was
scarcely
enough
left
to
fill
the
canteens
for
the
day
in
view
of
this
we
could
promise
ourselves
no
midday
meal
except
a
can
of
tomatoes
to
the
man
so
the
wagon
was
ordered
to
drive
through
to
the
expected
water
ahead
while
the
saddle
horses
were
held
available
as
on
the
day
before
for
frequent
changing
of
mounts
the
day
turned
out
to
be
one
of
torrid
heat
and
before
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
the
cattle
lolled
their
tongues
in
despair
while
their
sullen
lowing
surged
through
from
rear
to
lead
and
back
again
in
piteous
yet
ominous
appeal
the
only
relief
we
could
offer
was
to
travel
them
slowly
as
they
spurned
every
opportunity
offered
them
either
to
graze
or
to
lie
down
it
was
nearly
noon
when
we
reached
the
last
divide
and
sighted
the
scattering
timber
of
the
expected
watercourse
the
enforced
order
of
the
day
before
to
hold
the
herd
in
a
walk
and
prevent
exertion
and
heating
now
required
four
men
in
the
lead
while
the
rear
followed
over
a
mile
behind
dogged
and
sullen
near
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
mccann
returned
on
one
of
his
mules
with
the
word
that
it
was
a
question
if
there
was
water
enough
to
water
even
the
horse
stock
the
preceding
outfit
so
he
reported
had
dug
a
shallow
well
in
the
bed
of
the
creek
from
which
he
had
filled
his
kegs
but
the
stock
water
was
a
mere
loblolly
on
receipt
of
this
news
we
changed
mounts
for
the
fifth
time
that
day
and
flood
taking
forrest
the
cook
and
the
horse
wrangler
pushed
on
ahead
with
the
to
the
waterless
stream
the
outlook
was
anything
but
encouraging
flood
and
forrest
scouted
the
creek
up
and
down
for
ten
miles
in
a
fruitless
search
for
water
the
outfit
held
the
herd
back
until
the
twilight
of
evening
when
flood
returned
and
confirmed
mccann
report
it
was
twenty
miles
yet
to
the
next
water
ahead
and
if
the
horse
stock
could
only
be
watered
thoroughly
flood
was
determined
to
make
the
attempt
to
nurse
the
herd
through
to
water
mccann
was
digging
an
extra
well
and
he
expressed
the
belief
that
by
hollowing
out
a
number
of
holes
enough
water
could
be
secured
for
the
saddle
stock
honeyman
had
corralled
the
horses
and
was
letting
only
a
few
go
to
the
water
at
a
time
while
the
night
horses
were
being
thoroughly
watered
as
fast
as
the
water
rose
in
the
well
holding
the
herd
this
third
night
required
all
hands
only
a
few
men
at
a
time
were
allowed
to
go
into
camp
and
eat
for
the
herd
refused
even
to
lie
down
what
few
cattle
attempted
to
rest
were
prevented
by
the
more
restless
ones
by
spells
they
would
mill
until
riders
were
sent
through
the
herd
at
a
pace
to
break
up
the
groups
during
these
milling
efforts
of
the
herd
we
drifted
over
a
mile
from
camp
but
by
the
light
of
moon
and
stars
and
the
number
of
riders
scattering
was
prevented
as
the
horses
were
loose
for
the
night
we
could
not
start
them
on
the
trail
until
daybreak
gave
us
a
change
of
mounts
so
we
lost
the
early
start
of
the
morning
before
good
cloudy
weather
would
have
saved
us
but
in
its
stead
was
a
sultry
morning
without
a
breath
of
air
which
bespoke
another
day
of
sizzling
heat
we
had
not
been
on
the
trail
over
two
hours
before
the
heat
became
almost
unbearable
to
man
and
beast
had
it
not
been
for
the
condition
of
the
herd
all
might
yet
have
gone
well
but
over
three
days
had
now
elapsed
without
water
for
the
cattle
and
they
became
feverish
and
ungovernable
the
lead
cattle
turned
back
several
times
wandering
aimlessly
in
any
direction
and
it
was
with
considerable
difficulty
that
the
herd
could
be
held
on
the
trail
the
rear
overtook
the
lead
and
the
cattle
gradually
lost
all
semblance
of
a
trail
herd
our
horses
were
fresh
however
and
after
about
two
hours
work
we
once
more
got
the
herd
strung
out
in
trailing
fashion
but
before
a
mile
had
been
covered
the
leaders
again
turned
and
the
cattle
congregated
into
a
mass
of
unmanageable
animals
milling
and
lowing
in
their
fever
and
thirst
the
milling
only
intensified
their
sufferings
from
the
heat
and
the
outfit
split
and
quartered
them
again
and
again
in
the
hope
that
this
unfortunate
outbreak
might
be
checked
no
sooner
was
the
milling
stopped
than
they
would
surge
hither
and
yon
sometimes
half
a
mile
as
ungovernable
as
the
waves
of
an
ocean
after
wasting
several
hours
in
this
manner
they
finally
turned
back
over
the
trail
and
the
utmost
efforts
of
every
man
in
the
outfit
failed
to
check
them
we
threw
our
ropes
in
their
faces
and
when
this
failed
we
resorted
to
shooting
but
in
defiance
of
the
fusillade
and
the
smoke
they
walked
sullenly
through
the
line
of
horsemen
across
their
front
were
discharged
so
close
to
the
leaders
faces
as
to
singe
their
hair
yet
under
a
noonday
sun
they
disregarded
this
and
every
other
device
to
turn
them
and
passed
wholly
out
of
our
control
in
a
number
of
instances
wild
steers
deliberately
walked
against
our
horses
and
then
for
the
first
time
a
fact
dawned
on
us
that
chilled
the
marrow
in
our
bones
herd
was
going
the
bones
of
men
and
animals
that
lie
bleaching
along
the
trails
abundantly
testify
that
this
was
not
the
first
instance
in
which
the
plain
had
baffled
the
determination
of
man
it
was
now
evident
that
nothing
short
of
water
would
stop
the
herd
and
we
rode
aside
and
let
them
pass
as
the
outfit
turned
back
to
the
wagon
our
foreman
seemed
dazed
by
the
sudden
and
unexpected
turn
of
affairs
but
rallied
and
met
the
emergency
there
but
one
thing
left
to
do
said
he
as
we
rode
along
and
that
is
to
hurry
the
outfit
back
to
indian
lakes
the
herd
will
travel
day
and
night
and
instinct
can
be
depended
on
to
carry
them
to
the
only
water
they
know
it
too
late
to
be
of
any
use
now
but
plain
why
those
last
two
herds
turned
off
at
the
lakes
some
one
had
gone
back
and
warned
them
of
the
very
thing
we
met
we
must
beat
them
to
the
lakes
for
water
is
the
only
thing
that
will
check
them
now
it
a
good
thing
that
they
are
strong
and
five
or
six
days
without
water
will
hardly
kill
any
it
was
no
vague
statement
of
the
man
who
said
if
he
owned
hell
and
texas
he
rent
texas
and
live
in
hell
for
if
this
is
billy
hell
i
like
to
know
what
you
call
it
we
spent
an
hour
watering
the
horses
from
the
wells
of
our
camp
of
the
night
before
and
about
two
started
back
over
the
trail
for
indian
lakes
we
overtook
the
abandoned
herd
during
the
afternoon
they
were
strung
out
nearly
five
miles
in
length
and
were
walking
about
a
gait
four
men
were
given
two
extra
horses
apiece
and
left
to
throw
in
the
stragglers
in
the
rear
with
instructions
to
follow
them
well
into
the
night
and
again
in
the
morning
as
long
as
their
canteens
lasted
the
remainder
of
the
outfit
pushed
on
without
a
halt
except
to
change
mounts
and
reached
the
lakes
shortly
after
midnight
there
we
secured
the
first
good
sleep
of
any
consequence
for
three
days
it
was
fortunate
for
us
that
there
were
no
range
cattle
at
these
lakes
and
we
had
only
to
cover
a
front
of
about
six
miles
to
catch
the
drifting
herd
it
was
nearly
noon
the
next
day
before
the
cattle
began
to
arrive
at
the
water
holes
in
squads
of
from
twenty
to
fifty
pitiful
objects
as
they
were
it
was
a
novelty
to
see
them
reach
the
water
and
slack
their
thirst
wading
out
into
the
lakes
until
their
sides
were
half
covered
they
would
stand
and
low
in
a
soft
moaning
voice
often
for
half
an
hour
before
attempting
to
drink
contrary
to
our
expectation
they
drank
very
little
at
first
but
stood
in
the
water
for
hours
after
coming
out
they
would
lie
down
and
rest
for
hours
longer
and
then
drink
again
before
attempting
to
graze
their
thirst
overpowering
hunger
that
they
were
blind
there
was
no
question
but
with
the
causes
that
produced
it
once
removed
it
was
probable
their
eyesight
would
gradually
return
by
early
evening
the
rear
guard
of
our
outfit
returned
and
reported
the
tail
end
of
the
herd
some
twenty
miles
behind
when
they
left
them
during
the
day
not
over
a
thousand
head
reached
the
lakes
and
towards
evening
we
put
these
under
herd
and
easily
held
them
during
the
night
all
four
of
the
men
who
constituted
the
rear
guard
were
sent
back
the
next
morning
to
prod
up
the
rear
again
and
during
the
night
at
least
a
thousand
more
came
into
the
lakes
which
held
them
better
than
a
hundred
men
with
the
recovery
of
the
cattle
our
hopes
grew
and
with
the
gradual
accessions
to
the
herd
confidence
was
again
completely
restored
our
saddle
stock
not
having
suffered
as
had
the
cattle
were
in
a
serviceable
condition
and
while
a
few
men
were
all
that
were
necessary
to
hold
the
herd
the
others
scoured
the
country
for
miles
in
search
of
any
possible
stragglers
which
might
have
missed
the
water
during
the
forenoon
of
the
third
day
at
the
lakes
nat
straw
the
foreman
of
ellison
first
herd
on
the
trail
rode
up
to
our
camp
he
was
scouting
for
water
for
his
herd
and
when
our
situation
was
explained
and
he
had
been
interrogated
regarding
loose
cattle
gave
us
the
good
news
that
no
stragglers
in
our
road
brand
had
been
met
by
their
outfit
this
was
welcome
news
for
we
had
made
no
count
yet
and
feared
some
of
them
in
their
locoed
condition
might
have
passed
the
water
during
the
night
our
misfortune
was
an
ill
wind
by
which
straw
profited
for
he
had
fully
expected
to
keep
on
by
the
old
route
but
with
our
disaster
staring
him
in
the
face
a
similar
experience
was
to
be
avoided
his
herd
reached
the
lakes
during
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
and
after
watering
turned
and
went
westward
over
the
new
route
taken
by
the
two
herds
which
preceded
us
he
had
a
herd
of
about
three
thousand
steers
and
was
driving
to
the
dodge
market
after
the
experience
we
had
just
gone
through
his
herd
and
outfit
were
a
welcome
sight
flood
made
inquiries
after
lovell
second
herd
under
my
brother
bob
as
foreman
but
straw
had
seen
or
heard
nothing
of
them
having
come
from
goliad
county
with
his
cattle
after
the
ellison
herd
had
passed
on
and
out
of
sight
our
squad
which
had
been
working
the
country
to
the
northward
over
the
route
by
which
the
abandoned
herd
had
returned
came
in
with
the
information
that
that
section
was
clear
of
cattle
and
that
they
had
only
found
three
head
dead
from
thirst
on
the
fourth
morning
as
the
herd
left
the
bed
ground
a
count
was
ordered
and
to
our
surprise
we
counted
out
head
more
than
we
had
received
on
the
banks
of
the
rio
grande
a
month
before
as
there
had
been
but
one
previous
occasion
to
count
the
number
of
strays
absorbed
into
our
herd
was
easily
accounted
for
by
priest
if
a
steer
herd
could
increase
on
the
trail
why
should
ours
that
had
over
a
thousand
cows
in
it
the
observation
was
hardly
borne
out
when
the
ages
of
our
herd
were
taken
into
consideration
but
in
texas
was
a
liberal
day
and
generation
and
cattle
stealing
was
too
drastic
a
term
to
use
for
the
chance
gain
of
a
few
cattle
when
the
foundations
of
princely
fortunes
were
being
laid
with
a
rope
and
a
branding
iron
in
order
to
give
the
ellison
herd
a
good
start
of
us
we
only
moved
our
wagon
to
the
farthest
lake
and
went
into
camp
for
the
day
the
herd
had
recovered
its
normal
condition
by
this
time
and
of
the
troubles
of
the
past
week
not
a
trace
remained
instead
our
herd
grazed
in
leisurely
content
over
a
thousand
acres
while
with
the
exception
of
a
few
men
on
herd
the
outfit
lounged
around
the
wagon
and
beguiled
the
time
with
cards
we
had
undergone
an
experience
which
my
bunkie
the
rebel
termed
an
interesting
incident
in
his
checkered
career
but
which
not
even
he
would
have
cared
to
repeat
that
night
while
on
night
herd
together
the
cattle
resting
in
all
contentment
we
rode
one
round
together
and
as
he
rolled
a
cigarette
he
gave
me
an
old
war
story
they
used
to
tell
the
story
in
the
army
that
during
one
of
the
winter
retreats
a
cavalryman
riding
along
in
the
wake
of
the
column
at
night
saw
a
hat
apparently
floating
in
the
mud
and
water
in
the
hope
that
it
might
be
a
better
hat
than
the
one
he
was
wearing
he
dismounted
to
get
it
feeling
his
way
carefully
through
the
ooze
until
he
reached
the
hat
he
was
surprised
to
find
a
man
underneath
and
wearing
it
comrade
he
sang
out
i
lend
you
a
hand
no
replied
the
fellow
all
right
i
got
a
good
mule
yet
under
me
chapter
vi
a
reminiscent
night
on
the
ninth
morning
we
made
our
second
start
from
the
indian
lakes
an
amusing
incident
occurred
during
the
last
night
of
our
camp
at
these
water
holes
coyotes
had
been
hanging
around
our
camp
for
several
days
and
during
the
quiet
hours
of
the
night
these
scavengers
of
the
plain
had
often
ventured
in
near
the
wagon
in
search
of
scraps
of
meat
or
anything
edible
rod
wheat
and
ash
borrowstone
had
made
their
beds
down
some
distance
from
the
wagon
the
coyotes
as
they
circled
round
the
camp
came
near
their
bed
and
in
sniffing
about
awoke
borrowstone
there
was
no
more
danger
of
attack
from
these
cowards
than
from
field
mice
but
their
presence
annoyed
ash
and
as
he
dared
not
shoot
he
threw
his
boots
at
the
varmints
imagine
his
chagrin
the
next
morning
to
find
that
one
boot
had
landed
among
the
banked
embers
of
the
and
was
burned
to
a
crisp
it
was
looked
upon
as
a
capital
joke
by
the
outfit
as
there
was
no
telling
when
we
would
reach
a
store
where
he
could
secure
another
pair
the
new
trail
after
bearing
to
the
westward
for
several
days
turned
northward
paralleling
the
old
one
and
a
week
later
we
came
into
the
old
trail
over
a
hundred
miles
north
of
the
indian
lakes
with
the
exception
of
one
drive
without
water
no
fault
could
be
found
with
the
new
trail
a
few
days
after
coming
into
the
old
trail
we
passed
mason
a
point
where
trail
herds
usually
put
in
for
supplies
as
we
passed
during
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
wagon
and
a
number
of
the
boys
went
into
the
burg
quince
forrest
and
billy
honeyman
were
the
only
two
in
the
outfit
for
whom
there
were
any
letters
with
the
exception
of
a
letter
from
lovell
which
was
common
property
never
having
been
over
the
trail
before
and
not
even
knowing
that
it
was
possible
to
hear
from
home
i
was
expecting
any
letter
but
i
felt
a
little
twinge
of
homesickness
that
night
when
honeyman
read
us
certain
portions
of
his
letter
which
was
from
his
sister
forrest
letter
was
from
a
sweetheart
and
after
reading
it
a
few
times
he
burnt
it
and
that
was
all
we
ever
knew
of
its
contents
for
he
was
too
foxy
to
say
anything
even
if
it
had
not
been
unfavorable
borrowstone
swaggered
around
camp
that
evening
in
a
new
pair
of
boots
which
had
the
lone
star
set
in
in
their
red
tops
at
our
last
camp
at
the
lakes
the
rebel
and
i
as
partners
had
been
shamefully
beaten
in
a
game
of
by
bull
durham
and
john
officer
and
had
demanded
satisfaction
in
another
trial
around
the
fire
that
night
we
borrowed
mccann
lantern
and
by
the
aid
of
it
and
the
had
an
abundance
of
light
for
our
game
in
the
absence
of
a
table
we
unrolled
a
bed
and
sat
down
indian
fashion
over
a
game
of
cards
in
which
all
friendship
ceased
the
outfit
with
the
exception
of
myself
had
come
from
the
same
neighborhood
and
an
item
in
honeyman
letter
causing
considerable
comment
was
a
wedding
which
had
occurred
since
the
outfit
had
left
it
seemed
that
a
number
of
the
boys
had
sparked
the
bride
in
times
past
and
now
that
she
was
married
their
minds
naturally
became
reminiscent
over
old
sweethearts
the
way
i
make
it
out
said
honeyman
in
commenting
on
the
news
is
that
the
girl
had
met
this
fellow
over
in
the
next
county
while
visiting
her
cousins
the
year
before
my
sister
gives
it
as
a
horseback
opinion
that
she
been
engaged
to
this
fellow
nearly
eight
months
girls
you
know
sabe
each
other
that
way
well
it
affect
my
appetite
any
if
all
the
girls
i
know
get
married
while
gone
you
certainly
have
never
experienced
the
tender
passion
said
fox
quarternight
to
our
horse
wrangler
as
he
lighted
his
pipe
with
a
brand
from
the
fire
now
i
have
that
the
reason
why
i
sympathize
with
these
old
beaus
of
the
bride
of
course
i
was
too
old
to
stand
any
show
on
her
string
and
i
reckon
the
fellow
who
got
her
ai
so
powerful
much
except
his
veneering
and
being
a
stranger
which
was
a
big
advantage
to
be
sure
if
she
took
a
smile
to
this
stranger
no
other
fellow
could
check
her
with
a
rope
and
a
snubbing
post
i
seen
girls
walk
right
by
a
dozen
good
fellows
and
fawn
over
some
scrub
my
experience
teaches
me
that
when
there
a
woman
in
it
it
haphazard
pot
luck
with
no
telling
which
way
the
cat
will
hop
you
ca
play
any
system
and
merit
cuts
little
figure
in
general
results
fox
said
durham
while
officer
was
shuffling
the
cards
your
auger
seems
well
oiled
and
working
keen
suppose
you
give
us
that
little
experience
of
yours
in
love
affairs
it
will
be
a
treat
to
those
of
us
who
have
never
been
in
love
and
wo
interrupt
the
game
a
particle
cut
loose
wo
you
it
a
long
time
back
said
quarternight
meditatively
and
the
scars
have
all
healed
so
i
do
mind
telling
it
i
was
born
and
raised
on
the
border
of
the
blue
grass
region
in
kentucky
i
had
the
misfortune
to
be
born
of
poor
but
honest
parents
as
they
do
in
stories
no
hero
ever
had
the
advantage
of
me
in
that
respect
in
love
affairs
however
it
a
high
card
in
your
hand
to
be
born
rich
the
country
around
my
old
home
had
good
schools
so
we
had
the
advantage
of
a
good
education
when
i
was
about
nineteen
i
went
away
from
home
one
winter
to
teach
school
a
little
country
school
about
fifteen
miles
from
home
but
in
the
old
states
fifteen
miles
from
home
makes
you
a
dead
rank
stranger
the
trustee
of
the
township
was
shucking
corn
when
i
went
to
apply
for
the
school
i
simply
whipped
out
my
peg
and
helped
him
shuck
out
a
shock
or
two
while
we
talked
over
school
matters
the
dinner
bell
rang
and
he
insisted
on
my
staying
for
dinner
with
him
well
he
gave
me
a
better
school
than
i
had
asked
for
better
neighborhood
he
said
and
told
me
to
board
with
a
certain
family
who
had
no
children
he
gave
his
reasons
but
immaterial
they
were
friends
of
his
so
i
learned
afterwards
they
proved
to
be
fine
people
the
woman
was
one
of
those
kindly
souls
who
never
know
where
to
stop
she
planned
and
schemed
to
marry
me
off
in
spite
of
myself
the
first
month
that
i
was
with
them
she
told
me
all
about
the
girls
in
that
immediate
neighborhood
in
fact
she
rather
got
me
unduly
excited
being
a
youth
and
somewhat
verdant
she
dwelt
powerful
heavy
on
a
girl
who
lived
in
a
big
brick
house
which
stood
back
of
the
road
some
distance
this
girl
had
gone
to
school
at
a
seminary
for
young
ladies
near
lexington
studied
music
and
painting
and
was
up
on
everything
she
described
her
to
me
as
with
raven
tresses
just
like
you
read
about
in
novels
things
were
rocking
along
nicely
when
a
few
days
before
christmas
a
little
girl
who
belonged
to
the
family
who
lived
in
the
brick
house
brought
me
a
note
one
morning
it
was
an
invitation
to
take
supper
with
them
the
following
evening
the
note
was
written
in
a
pretty
hand
and
the
name
signed
to
it
i
satisfied
now
it
was
a
forgery
my
landlady
agreed
with
me
on
that
point
in
fact
she
may
have
mentioned
it
first
i
never
ought
to
have
taken
her
into
my
confidence
like
i
did
but
i
wanted
to
consult
her
showed
her
the
invitation
and
asked
her
advice
she
was
in
the
seventh
heaven
of
delight
had
me
answer
it
at
once
accept
the
invitation
with
pleasure
and
a
lot
of
stuff
that
i
never
used
before
she
had
been
young
once
herself
i
used
up
five
or
six
sheets
of
paper
in
writing
the
answer
spoilt
one
after
another
and
the
one
i
did
send
was
a
flat
failure
compared
to
the
one
i
received
well
the
next
evening
when
it
was
time
to
start
i
was
nervous
and
uneasy
it
was
nearly
dark
when
i
reached
the
house
but
i
wanted
it
that
way
say
but
when
i
knocked
on
the
front
door
of
that
house
it
was
with
fear
and
trembling
this
mr
quarternight
inquired
a
very
affable
lady
who
received
me
i
knew
i
was
one
of
old
man
quarternight
seven
boys
and
admitted
that
that
was
my
name
though
it
was
the
first
time
any
one
had
ever
called
me
i
was
welcomed
ushered
in
and
introduced
all
around
there
were
a
few
small
children
whom
i
knew
so
i
managed
to
talk
to
them
the
girl
whom
i
was
being
braced
against
was
not
a
particle
overrated
but
sustained
the
kentucky
reputation
for
beauty
she
made
herself
so
pleasant
and
agreeable
that
my
fears
soon
subsided
when
the
man
of
the
house
came
in
i
was
cured
entirely
he
was
gruff
and
hearty
opened
his
mouth
and
laughed
deep
i
built
right
up
to
him
we
talked
about
cattle
and
horses
until
supper
was
announced
he
was
really
sorry
i
had
come
earlier
so
as
to
look
at
a
three
year
old
colt
that
he
set
a
heap
of
store
by
he
showed
him
to
me
after
supper
with
a
lantern
fine
colt
too
i
do
remember
much
about
the
supper
except
that
it
was
fine
and
i
came
near
spilling
my
coffee
several
times
my
hands
were
so
large
and
my
coat
sleeves
so
short
when
we
returned
from
looking
at
the
colt
we
went
into
the
parlor
say
fellows
it
was
a
little
the
nicest
thing
that
ever
i
went
against
carpet
that
made
you
think
you
were
going
to
bog
down
every
step
springy
like
marsh
land
and
i
was
glad
i
came
then
the
younger
children
were
ordered
to
retire
and
shortly
afterward
the
man
and
his
wife
followed
suit
when
i
heard
the
old
man
throw
his
heavy
boots
on
the
floor
in
the
next
room
i
realized
that
i
was
left
all
alone
with
their
charming
daughter
all
my
fears
of
the
early
part
of
the
evening
tried
to
crowd
on
me
again
but
were
calmed
by
the
girl
who
sang
and
played
on
the
piano
with
no
audience
but
me
then
she
interested
me
by
telling
her
school
experiences
and
how
glad
she
was
that
they
were
over
finally
she
lugged
out
a
great
big
family
album
and
sat
down
aside
of
me
on
one
of
these
horsehair
sofas
that
album
had
a
clasp
on
it
a
buckle
of
pure
silver
same
as
these
eighteen
dollar
bridles
while
we
were
looking
at
the
pictures
some
of
the
old
varmints
had
fought
in
the
revolutionary
war
so
she
said
i
noticed
how
close
we
were
sitting
together
then
we
sat
farther
apart
after
we
had
gone
through
the
album
one
on
each
end
of
the
sofa
and
talked
about
the
neighborhood
until
i
suddenly
remembered
that
i
had
to
go
while
she
was
getting
my
hat
and
i
was
getting
away
somehow
she
had
me
promise
to
take
dinner
with
them
on
christmas
for
the
next
two
or
three
months
it
was
hard
to
tell
if
i
lived
at
my
boarding
house
or
at
the
brick
if
i
failed
to
go
my
landlady
would
hatch
up
some
errand
and
send
me
over
if
she
had
been
such
a
good
woman
i
never
forgive
her
for
leading
me
to
the
sacrifice
like
she
did
well
about
two
weeks
before
school
was
out
i
went
home
over
saturday
and
sunday
those
were
fatal
days
in
my
life
when
i
returned
on
monday
morning
there
was
a
letter
waiting
for
me
it
was
from
the
girl
mamma
there
had
been
a
quilting
in
the
neighborhood
on
saturday
and
at
this
meet
of
the
local
gossips
some
one
had
hinted
that
there
was
liable
to
be
a
wedding
as
soon
as
school
was
out
mamma
was
present
and
neither
admitted
nor
denied
the
charge
but
there
was
a
woman
at
this
quilting
who
had
once
lived
over
in
our
neighborhood
and
felt
it
her
duty
to
enlighten
the
company
as
to
who
i
was
i
got
all
this
later
from
my
landlady
me
said
this
woman
round
here
in
this
section
think
our
teacher
is
the
son
of
that
big
farmer
who
raises
so
many
cattle
and
horses
why
i
known
both
families
of
those
quarternights
for
nigh
on
to
thirty
year
our
teacher
is
one
of
old
john
fox
boys
the
irish
quarternights
who
live
up
near
the
salt
licks
on
doe
run
they
were
always
so
poor
that
the
children
never
had
enough
to
eat
and
hardly
half
enough
to
wear
this
plain
statement
of
facts
fell
like
a
bombshell
on
mamma
she
started
a
private
investigation
of
her
own
and
her
verdict
was
in
that
letter
it
was
a
centre
shot
that
evening
when
i
locked
the
schoolhouse
door
it
was
for
the
last
time
for
i
never
unlocked
it
again
my
landlady
dear
old
womanly
soul
tried
hard
to
have
me
teach
the
school
out
at
least
but
i
did
see
it
that
way
the
cause
of
education
in
kentucky
might
have
gone
straight
to
eternal
hell
before
i
have
stayed
another
day
in
that
neighborhood
i
had
money
enough
to
get
to
texas
with
and
here
i
am
when
a
fellow
gets
it
burnt
into
him
like
a
brand
that
way
once
it
lasts
him
quite
a
while
he
feel
his
way
next
time
that
was
rather
a
raw
deal
to
give
a
fellow
said
officer
who
had
been
listening
while
playing
cards
did
you
never
see
the
girl
again
no
nor
you
would
want
to
either
if
that
letter
had
been
written
to
you
and
some
folks
claim
that
seven
is
a
lucky
number
there
were
seven
boys
in
our
family
and
nary
one
ever
married
that
experience
of
fox
remarked
honeyman
after
a
short
silence
is
almost
similar
to
one
i
had
before
lovell
and
flood
adopted
me
i
worked
for
a
horse
man
down
on
the
nueces
every
year
he
drove
up
the
trail
a
large
herd
of
horse
stock
we
drove
to
the
same
point
on
the
trail
each
year
and
i
happened
to
get
acquainted
up
there
with
a
family
that
had
several
girls
in
it
the
youngest
girl
in
the
family
and
i
seemed
to
understand
each
other
fairly
well
i
had
to
stay
at
the
horse
camp
most
of
the
time
and
in
one
way
and
another
did
not
get
to
see
her
as
much
as
i
would
have
liked
when
we
sold
out
the
herd
i
hung
around
for
a
week
or
so
and
spent
a
month
wages
showing
her
the
cloud
with
the
silver
lining
she
stood
it
all
easy
too
when
the
outfit
went
home
of
course
i
went
with
them
i
was
banking
plenty
strong
however
that
next
year
if
there
was
a
good
market
in
horses
i
take
her
home
with
me
i
had
saved
my
wages
and
rustled
around
and
when
we
started
up
the
trail
next
year
i
had
forty
horses
of
my
own
in
the
herd
i
had
figured
they
would
bring
me
a
thousand
dollars
and
there
was
my
wages
besides
when
we
reached
this
place
we
held
the
herd
out
twenty
miles
so
it
was
some
time
before
i
got
into
town
to
see
the
girl
but
the
first
time
i
did
get
to
see
her
i
learned
that
an
older
sister
of
hers
who
had
run
away
with
some
renegade
from
texas
a
year
or
so
before
had
drifted
back
home
lately
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
a
big
fat
baby
boy
in
her
arms
she
warned
me
to
keep
away
from
the
house
for
men
from
texas
were
at
a
slight
discount
right
then
in
that
family
the
girl
seemed
to
regret
it
and
talked
reasonable
and
i
thought
i
could
see
encouragement
i
did
crowd
matters
nor
did
her
folks
forget
me
when
they
heard
that
byler
had
come
in
with
a
horse
herd
from
the
nueces
i
met
the
girl
away
from
home
several
times
during
the
summer
and
learned
that
they
kept
hot
water
on
tap
to
scald
me
if
i
ever
dared
to
show
up
one
from
texas
had
simply
surfeited
that
family
there
was
no
other
vacancy
about
the
time
we
closed
out
and
were
again
ready
to
go
home
there
was
a
cattleman
ball
given
in
this
little
trail
town
we
stayed
over
several
days
to
take
in
this
ball
as
i
had
some
plans
of
my
own
my
girl
was
at
the
ball
all
easy
enough
but
she
warned
me
that
her
brother
was
watching
me
i
paid
no
attention
to
him
and
danced
with
her
right
along
begging
her
to
run
away
with
me
it
was
obviously
the
only
play
to
make
but
the
more
her
the
more
she
the
family
was
on
the
prod
bigger
than
a
wolf
and
there
was
no
use
reasoning
with
them
after
i
had
had
every
dance
with
her
for
an
hour
or
so
her
brother
coolly
stepped
in
and
took
her
home
the
next
morning
he
felt
it
his
duty
as
his
sister
protector
to
hunt
me
up
and
inform
me
that
if
i
even
spoke
to
his
sister
again
he
shoot
me
like
a
dog
that
a
bluff
or
do
you
mean
it
for
a
real
play
i
inquired
politely
find
that
it
will
be
real
enough
he
answered
angrily
now
that
too
bad
i
answered
really
sorry
that
i
ca
promise
to
respect
your
request
but
this
much
i
can
assure
you
any
time
that
you
have
the
leisure
and
want
to
shoot
me
just
cut
loose
your
dog
but
remember
this
one
thing
that
it
will
be
my
second
shot
are
you
sure
you
was
running
a
blazer
yourself
or
is
the
wind
merely
rising
inquired
durham
while
i
was
shuffling
the
cards
for
the
next
deal
well
if
i
was
i
hung
up
my
gentle
honk
before
his
eyes
and
ears
and
gave
him
free
license
to
call
it
the
truth
is
i
did
pay
any
more
attention
to
him
than
i
would
to
an
empty
bottle
i
reckon
the
girl
was
all
right
but
the
family
were
these
barnyard
savages
it
makes
me
hot
under
the
collar
yet
when
i
think
of
it
they
have
lawed
me
if
i
had
but
i
ought
to
have
shot
him
and
checked
the
breed
why
did
you
run
off
with
her
inquired
fox
dryly
well
of
course
a
man
of
your
nerve
is
always
capable
of
advising
others
but
you
see
i
strong
on
the
breed
now
a
girl
ca
show
her
true
colors
like
the
girl
brother
did
but
get
her
in
the
harness
once
and
then
she
show
you
the
white
of
her
eye
balk
and
possibly
kick
over
the
wagon
tongue
no
i
believe
in
the
breed

i
worked
for
a
cowman
once
said
bull
irrelevantly
and
they
told
it
on
him
that
he
lost
twenty
thousand
dollars
the
night
he
was
married
how
gambling
i
inquired
no
the
woman
he
married
claimed
to
be
worth
twenty
thousand
dollars
and
she
never
had
a
cent
spades
trump
no
hearts
replied
the
rebel
i
used
to
know
a
foreman
up
in
dewitt
county
john
glen
they
called
him
he
claimed
the
only
chance
he
ever
had
to
marry
was
a
widow
and
the
reason
he
marry
her
was
he
was
too
honest
to
take
advantage
of
a
dead
man
while
we
paid
little
attention
to
wind
or
weather
this
was
an
ideal
night
and
we
were
laggard
in
seeking
our
blankets
yarn
followed
yarn
for
nearly
every
one
of
us
either
from
observation
or
from
practical
experience
had
a
slight
acquaintance
with
the
great
mastering
passion
but
the
poetical
had
not
been
developed
in
us
to
an
appreciative
degree
so
we
discussed
the
topic
under
consideration
much
as
we
would
have
done
horses
or
cattle
finally
the
game
ended
a
general
yawn
went
the
round
of
the
loungers
about
the
fire
the
second
guard
had
gone
on
and
when
the
first
rode
in
joe
stallings
halting
his
horse
in
passing
the
fire
called
out
sociably
that
muley
steer
the
white
four
year
old
did
like
to
bed
down
amongst
the
others
so
i
let
him
come
out
and
lay
down
by
himself
you
find
him
over
on
the
far
side
of
the
herd
you
all
remember
how
wild
he
was
when
we
first
started
well
you
can
ride
within
three
feet
of
him
and
he
grunt
and
act
sociable
and
never
offer
to
get
up
i
promised
him
that
he
might
sleep
alone
as
long
as
he
was
good
i
just
love
a
good
steer
make
down

chapter
vii
the
colorado
the
month
of
may
found
our
circle
dot
herd
in
spite
of
all
drawbacks
nearly
five
hundred
miles
on
its
way
for
the
past
week
we
had
been
traveling
over
that
immense
tableland
which
skirts
the
arid
portion
of
western
texas
a
few
days
before
while
passing
the
blue
mountains
which
stand
as
a
southern
sentinel
in
the
chain
marking
the
headwaters
of
the
concho
river
we
had
our
first
glimpse
of
the
hills
in
its
almost
primitive
condition
the
country
was
generous
supplying
every
want
for
sustenance
of
horses
and
cattle
the
grass
at
this
stage
of
the
season
was
well
matured
the
herd
taking
on
flesh
in
a
very
gratifying
manner
and
while
we
had
crossed
some
rocky
country
lame
and
cattle
had
as
yet
caused
us
no
serious
trouble
one
morning
when
within
one
day
drive
of
the
colorado
river
as
our
herd
was
leaving
the
bed
ground
the
last
guard
encountered
a
bunch
of
cattle
drifting
back
down
the
trail
there
were
nearly
fifty
head
of
the
stragglers
and
as
one
of
our
men
on
guard
turned
them
to
throw
them
away
from
our
herd
the
road
brand
caught
his
eye
and
he
recognized
the
strays
as
belonging
to
the
ellison
herd
which
had
passed
us
at
the
indian
lakes
some
ten
days
before
flood
attention
once
drawn
to
the
brand
he
ordered
them
thrown
into
our
herd
it
was
evident
that
some
trouble
had
occurred
with
the
ellison
cattle
possibly
a
stampede
and
it
was
but
a
neighborly
act
to
lend
any
assistance
in
our
power
as
soon
as
the
outfit
could
breakfast
mount
and
take
the
herd
flood
sent
priest
and
me
to
scout
the
country
to
the
westward
of
the
trail
while
bob
blades
and
ash
borrowstone
started
on
a
similar
errand
to
the
eastward
with
orders
to
throw
in
any
drifting
cattle
in
the
ellison
road
brand
within
an
hour
after
starting
the
herd
encountered
several
straggling
bands
and
as
priest
and
i
were
on
the
point
of
returning
to
the
herd
we
almost
overrode
a
bunch
of
eighty
odd
head
lying
down
in
some
broken
country
they
were
gaunt
and
tired
and
the
rebel
at
once
pronounced
their
stiffened
movements
the
result
of
a
stampede
we
were
drifting
them
back
towards
the
trail
when
nat
straw
and
two
of
his
men
rode
out
from
our
herd
and
met
us
i
always
did
claim
that
it
was
better
to
be
born
lucky
than
handsome
said
straw
as
he
rode
up
one
week
flood
saves
me
from
a
dry
drive
and
the
very
next
one
he
just
the
right
distance
behind
to
catch
my
drift
from
a
nasty
stampede
not
only
that
but
my
peelers
and
i
are

as
well
as
reaching
the
wagon
in
time
for
breakfast
and
lining
our
flues
with
lovell
good
chuck
it
too
good
luck
to
last
afraid
i
not
hankering
for
the
dramatic
in
life
but
we
had
a
run
last
night
that
would
curl
your
hair
just
about
midnight
a
bunch
of
range
cattle
ran
into
us
and
before
you
could
say
jack
robinson
our
dogies
had
vamoosed
the
ranch
and
were
running
in
half
a
dozen
different
directions
we
rounded
them
up
the
best
we
could
in
the
dark
and
then
i
took
a
couple
of
men
and
came
back
down
the
trail
about
twenty
miles
to
catch
any
drift
when
day
dawned
but
you
see
there
nothing
like
being
lucky
and
having
good
neighbors
cattle
caught
fresh
horses
and
a
warm
breakfast
all
waiting
for
you
i
such
a
lucky
dog
it
a
wonder
some
one
did
steal
me
when
i
was
little
i
ca
help
it
but
some
day
i
marry
a
banker
daughter
or
fall
heir
to
a
ranch
as
big
as
old
mcculloch
county
before
meeting
us
straw
had
confided
to
our
foreman
that
he
could
assign
no
other
plausible
excuse
for
the
stampede
than
that
it
was
the
work
of
cattle
rustlers
he
claimed
to
know
the
country
along
the
colorado
and
unless
it
had
changed
recently
those
hills
to
the
westward
harbored
a
good
many
of
the
worst
rustlers
in
the
state
he
admitted
it
might
have
been
wolves
chasing
the
range
cattle
but
thought
it
had
the
earmarks
of
being
done
by
human
wolves
he
maintained
that
few
herds
had
ever
passed
that
river
without
loss
of
cattle
unless
the
rustlers
were
too
busy
elsewhere
to
give
the
passing
herd
their
attention
straw
had
ordered
his
herd
to
drop
back
down
the
trail
about
ten
miles
from
their
camp
of
the
night
previous
and
about
noon
the
two
herds
met
on
a
branch
of
brady
creek
by
that
time
our
herd
had
nearly
three
hundred
head
of
the
ellison
cattle
so
we
held
it
up
and
cut
theirs
out
straw
urged
our
foreman
whatever
he
did
not
to
make
camp
in
the
colorado
bottoms
or
anywhere
near
the
river
if
he
did
want
a
repetition
of
his
experience
after
starting
our
herd
in
the
afternoon
about
half
a
dozen
of
us
turned
back
and
lent
a
hand
in
counting
straw
herd
which
proved
to
be
over
a
hundred
head
short
and
nearly
half
his
outfit
were
still
out
hunting
cattle
acting
on
straw
advice
we
camped
that
night
some
five
or
six
miles
back
from
the
river
on
the
last
divide
from
the
time
the
second
guard
went
on
until
the
third
was
relieved
we
took
the
precaution
of
keeping
a
scout
outriding
from
a
half
to
three
quarters
of
a
mile
distant
from
the
herd
flood
and
honeyman
serving
in
that
capacity
every
precaution
was
taken
to
prevent
a
surprise
and
in
case
anything
did
happen
our
night
horses
tied
to
the
wagon
wheels
stood
ready
saddled
and
bridled
for
any
emergency
but
the
night
passed
without
incident
an
hour
or
two
after
the
herd
had
started
the
next
morning
four
well
mounted
strange
men
rode
up
from
the
westward
and
representing
themselves
as
trail
cutters
asked
for
our
foreman
flood
met
them
in
his
usual
quiet
manner
and
after
admitting
that
we
had
been
troubled
more
or
less
with
range
cattle
assured
our
callers
that
if
there
was
anything
in
the
herd
in
the
brands
they
represented
he
would
gladly
hold
it
up
and
give
them
every
opportunity
to
cut
their
cattle
out
as
he
was
anxious
to
cross
the
river
before
noon
he
invited
the
visitors
to
stay
for
dinner
assuring
them
that
before
starting
the
herd
in
the
afternoon
he
would
throw
the
cattle
together
for
their
inspection
flood
made
himself
very
agreeable
inquiring
into
cattle
and
range
matters
in
general
as
well
as
the
stage
of
water
in
the
river
ahead
the
spokesman
of
the
trail
cutters
met
flood
invitation
to
dinner
with
excuses
about
the
pressing
demands
on
his
time
and
urged
if
it
did
not
seriously
interfere
with
our
plans
that
he
be
allowed
to
inspect
the
herd
before
crossing
the
river
his
reasons
seemed
trivial
and
our
foreman
was
not
convinced
you
see
gentlemen
he
said
in
handling
these
southern
cattle
we
must
take
advantage
of
occasions
we
have
timed
our
morning
drive
so
as
to
reach
the
river
during
the
warmest
hour
of
the
day
or
as
near
noon
as
possible
you
can
hardly
imagine
what
a
difference
there
is
in
fording
this
herd
between
a
cool
cloudy
day
and
a
clear
hot
one
you
see
the
herd
is
strung
out
nearly
a
mile
in
length
now
and
to
hold
them
up
and
waste
an
hour
or
more
for
your
inspection
would
seriously
disturb
our
plans
and
then
our
wagon
and
have
gone
on
with
orders
to
noon
at
the
first
good
camp
beyond
the
river
i
perfectly
understand
your
reasons
and
you
equally
understand
mine
but
i
will
send
a
man
or
two
back
to
help
you
recross
any
cattle
you
may
find
in
our
herd
now
if
a
couple
of
you
gentlemen
will
ride
around
on
the
far
side
with
me
and
the
others
will
ride
up
near
the
lead
we
will
trail
the
cattle
across
when
we
reach
the
river
without
cutting
the
herd
into
blocks
flood
affability
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
lead
cattle
were
nearly
up
to
the
river
won
his
point
our
visitors
could
only
yield
and
rode
forward
with
our
lead
swing
men
to
assist
in
forcing
the
lead
cattle
into
the
river
it
was
swift
water
but
otherwise
an
easy
crossing
and
we
allowed
the
herd
after
coming
out
on
the
farther
side
to
spread
out
and
graze
forward
at
its
pleasure
the
wagon
and
saddle
stock
were
in
sight
about
a
mile
ahead
and
leaving
two
men
on
herd
to
drift
the
cattle
in
the
right
direction
the
rest
of
us
rode
leisurely
on
to
the
wagon
where
dinner
was
waiting
flood
treated
our
callers
with
marked
courtesy
during
dinner
and
casually
inquired
if
any
of
their
number
had
seen
any
cattle
that
day
or
the
day
previous
in
the
ellison
road
brand
they
had
not
they
said
explaining
that
their
range
lay
on
both
sides
of
the
concho
and
that
during
the
trail
season
they
kept
all
their
cattle
between
that
river
and
the
main
colorado
their
work
had
kept
them
on
their
own
range
recently
except
when
trail
herds
were
passing
and
needed
to
be
looked
through
for
strays
it
sounded
as
though
our
trail
cutters
could
also
use
diplomacy
on
occasion
when
dinner
was
over
and
we
had
caught
horses
for
the
afternoon
and
were
ready
to
mount
flood
asked
our
guests
for
their
credentials
as
duly
authorized
trail
cutters
they
replied
that
they
had
none
but
offered
in
explanation
the
statement
that
they
were
merely
cutting
in
the
interest
of
the
immediate
locality
which
required
no
written
authority
then
the
previous
affability
of
our
foreman
turned
to
iron
well
men
said
he
if
you
have
no
authority
to
cut
this
trail
then
you
do
cut
this
herd
i
must
have
inspection
papers
before
i
can
move
a
brand
out
of
the
county
in
which
it
is
bred
and
i
certainly
let
no
other
man
local
or
duly
appointed
cut
an
animal
out
of
this
herd
without
written
and
certified
authority
you
know
that
without
being
told
or
ought
to
i
respect
the
rights
of
every
man
posted
on
a
trail
to
cut
it
if
you
want
to
see
my
inspection
papers
you
have
a
right
to
demand
them
and
in
turn
i
demand
of
you
your
credentials
showing
who
you
work
for
and
the
list
of
brands
you
represent
otherwise
no
harm
done
nor
do
you
cut
any
herd
that
i
driving
well
said
one
of
the
men
i
saw
a
couple
of
head
in
my
own
individual
brand
as
we
rode
up
the
herd
i
like
to
see
the
man
who
says
that
i
have
the
right
to
claim
my
own
brand
anywhere
i
find
it
if
there
anything
in
our
herd
in
your
individual
brand
said
flood
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
give
me
the
brand
and
i
cut
it
for
you
what
your
brand
the
sash
have
any
of
you
boys
seen
such
a
brand
in
our
herd
inquired
flood
turning
to
us
as
we
all
stood
by
our
horses
ready
to
start
i
did
recognize
it
by
that
name
replied
quince
forrest
who
rode
in
the
swing
on
the
branded
side
of
the
cattle
and
belonged
to
the
last
guard
but
i
remember
seeing
such
a
brand
though
i
would
have
given
it
a
different
name
yes
come
to
think
i
sure
i
saw
it
and
i
tell
you
where
yesterday
morning
when
i
rode
out
to
throw
those
drifting
cattle
away
from
our
herd
i
saw
that
brand
among
the
ellison
cattle
which
had
stampeded
the
night
before
when
straw
outfit
cut
theirs
out
yesterday
they
must
have
left
the
sash
cattle
with
us
those
were
the
range
cattle
which
stampeded
his
herd
it
looked
to
me
a
little
blotched
but
if
i
been
called
on
to
name
it
i
called
it
a
thief
brand
if
these
gentlemen
claim
them
though
it
only
take
a
minute
to
cut
them
out
this
outfit
need
get
personal
and
fling
out
their
insults
retorted
the
claimant
of
the
window
sash
brand
for
i
claim
my
own
if
there
were
a
hundred
of
you
and
you
can
depend
that
any
animal
i
claim
i
take
if
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
ranch
and
bring
twenty
men
to
help
me
do
it
you
wo
need
any
help
to
get
all
that
coming
to
you
replied
our
foreman
as
he
mounted
his
horse
let
throw
the
herd
together
boys
and
cut
these
sash
cattle
out
we
do
want
any
cattle
in
our
herd
that
stampede
on
an
open
range
at
midnight
they
must
certainly
be
terrible
wild
as
we
rode
out
together
our
trail
cutters
dropped
behind
and
kept
a
respectable
distance
from
the
herd
while
we
threw
the
cattle
together
when
the
herd
had
closed
to
the
required
compactness
flood
called
our
trail
cutters
up
and
said
now
men
each
one
of
you
can
take
one
of
my
outfit
with
you
and
inspect
this
herd
to
your
satisfaction
if
you
see
anything
there
you
claim
we
cut
it
out
for
you
but
attempt
to
cut
anything
yourselves
we
rode
in
by
pairs
a
man
of
ours
with
each
stranger
and
after
riding
leisurely
through
the
herd
for
half
an
hour
cut
out
three
head
in
the
blotched
brand
called
the
window
sash
before
leaving
the
herd
one
of
the
strangers
laid
claim
to
a
red
cow
but
fox
quarternight
refused
to
cut
the
animal
when
the
pair
rode
out
the
stranger
accosted
flood
i
notice
a
cow
of
mine
in
there
said
he
not
in
your
road
brand
which
i
claim
your
man
here
refuses
to
cut
her
for
me
so
i
appeal
to
you
what
her
brand
fox
asked
flood
she
a
cow
but
the
colonel
here
thinks
it
an
i
happen
to
know
the
cow
and
the
brand
both
she
came
into
the
herd
four
hundred
miles
south
of
here
while
we
were
watering
the
herd
in
the
nueces
river
the
is
a
little
dim
but
it
plenty
plain
to
hold
her
for
the
present
if
she
a
cow
i
have
no
claim
on
her
protested
the
stranger
but
if
the
brand
is
an
then
i
claim
her
as
a
stray
from
our
range
and
i
do
care
if
she
came
into
your
herd
when
you
were
watering
in
the
san
fernando
river
in
old
mexico
i
claim
her
just
the
same
i
going
to
ask
you
to
throw
her
i
throw
her
for
you
coolly
replied
fox
and
bet
you
my
saddle
and
on
the
side
that
it
is
an
and
even
if
it
was
you
and
all
the
thieves
on
the
concho
ca
take
her
i
know
a
few
of
the
simple
principles
of
rustling
myself
do
you
want
her
thrown
that
what
i
asked
for
throw
her
then
said
flood
and
do
let
parley
fox
rode
back
in
to
the
herd
and
after
some
little
delay
located
the
cow
and
worked
her
out
to
the
edge
of
the
cattle
dropping
his
rope
he
cut
her
out
clear
of
the
herd
and
as
she
circled
around
in
an
endeavor
to
reenter
he
rode
close
and
made
an
easy
cast
of
the
rope
about
her
horns
as
he
threw
his
horse
back
to
check
the
cow
i
rode
to
his
assistance
my
rope
in
hand
and
as
the
cow
turned
ends
i
heeled
her
a
number
of
the
outfit
rode
up
and
dismounted
and
one
of
the
boys
taking
her
by
the
tail
we
threw
the
animal
as
humanely
as
possible
in
order
to
get
at
the
brand
which
was
on
the
side
we
turned
the
cow
over
when
flood
took
out
his
knife
and
cut
the
hair
away
leaving
the
brand
easily
traceable
what
is
she
jim
inquired
fox
as
he
sat
his
horse
holding
the
rope
taut
i
let
this
man
who
claims
her
answer
that
question
replied
flood
as
her
claimant
critically
examined
the
brand
to
his
satisfaction
i
claim
her
as
an
cow
said
the
stranger
facing
flood
well
you
claim
more
than
you
ever
get
replied
our
foreman
turn
her
loose
boys
the
cow
was
freed
and
turned
back
into
the
herd
but
the
claimant
tried
to
argue
the
matter
with
flood
claiming
the
branding
iron
had
simply
slipped
giving
it
the
appearance
of
a
q
instead
of
an
o
as
it
was
intended
to
be
our
foreman
paid
little
attention
to
the
stranger
but
when
his
persistence
became
annoying
checked
his
argument
by
saying
my
christian
friend
there
no
use
arguing
this
matter
you
asked
to
have
the
cow
thrown
and
we
threw
her
you
might
as
well
try
to
tell
me
that
the
cow
is
white
as
to
claim
her
in
any
other
brand
than
a
you
may
read
brands
as
well
as
i
do
but
you
wasting
time
arguing
against
the
facts
you
better
take
your
sash
cattle
and
ride
on
for
you
cut
all
you
going
to
cut
here
but
before
you
go
for
fear
i
may
never
see
you
again
i
take
this
occasion
to
say
that
i
think
you
common
cow
thieves
by
his
straight
talk
our
foreman
stood
several
inches
higher
in
our
estimation
as
we
sat
our
horses
grinning
at
the
discomfiture
of
the
trail
cutters
while
a
dozen
slouched
languidly
at
our
hips
to
give
emphasis
to
his
words
before
going
i
take
this
occasion
to
say
to
you
that
you
will
see
me
again
replied
the
leader
riding
up
and
confronting
flood
you
have
got
near
enough
men
to
bluff
me
as
to
calling
me
a
cow
thief
that
altogether
too
common
a
name
to
offend
any
one
and
from
what
i
can
gather
the
name
would
miss
you
or
your
outfit
over
a
thousand
miles
now
in
taking
my
leave
i
want
to
tell
you
that
you
see
me
before
another
day
passes
and
what
more
i
bring
an
outfit
with
me
and
we
cut
your
herd
clean
to
your
road
brand
if
for
no
better
reasons
just
to
learn
you
not
to
be
so
insolent
after
hanging
up
this
threat
flood
said
to
him
as
he
turned
to
ride
away
well
now
my
young
friend
you
bargaining
for
a
whole
lot
of
fun
i
notice
you
carry
a
gun
and
quite
naturally
suppose
you
shoot
a
little
as
occasion
requires
suppose
when
you
and
your
outfit
come
back
you
come
so
we
know
who
you
are
for
i
promise
you
there
liable
to
be
some
powder
burnt
when
you
cut
this
herd
amid
jeers
of
derision
from
our
outfit
the
trail
cutters
drove
off
their
three
lonely
window
sash
cattle
we
had
gained
the
point
we
wanted
and
now
in
case
of
any
trouble
during
inspection
or
at
night
we
had
the
river
behind
us
to
catch
our
herd
we
paid
little
attention
to
the
threat
of
our
disappointed
callers
but
several
times
remarks
as
to
the
character
of
the
residents
of
those
hills
to
the
westward
recurred
to
my
mind
i
was
young
but
knew
enough
instead
of
asking
foolish
questions
to
keep
mum
though
my
eyes
and
ears
drank
in
everything
before
we
had
been
on
the
trail
over
an
hour
we
met
two
men
riding
down
the
trail
towards
the
river
meeting
us
they
turned
and
rode
along
with
our
foreman
some
distance
apart
from
the
herd
for
nearly
an
hour
and
curiosity
ran
freely
among
us
boys
around
the
herd
as
to
who
they
might
be
finally
flood
rode
forward
to
the
point
men
and
gave
the
order
to
throw
off
the
trail
and
make
a
short
drive
that
afternoon
then
in
company
with
the
two
strangers
he
rode
forward
to
overtake
our
wagon
and
we
saw
nothing
more
of
him
until
we
reached
camp
that
evening
this
much
however
our
point
man
was
able
to
get
from
our
foreman
that
the
two
men
were
members
of
a
detachment
of
rangers
who
had
been
sent
as
a
result
of
information
given
by
the
first
herd
over
the
trail
that
year
this
herd
which
had
passed
some
twenty
days
ahead
of
us
had
met
with
a
stampede
below
the
river
and
on
reaching
abilene
had
reported
the
presence
of
rustlers
preying
on
through
herds
at
the
crossing
of
the
colorado
on
reaching
camp
that
evening
with
the
herd
we
found
ten
of
the
rangers
as
our
guests
for
the
night
the
detachment
was
under
a
corporal
named
joe
hames
who
had
detailed
the
two
men
we
had
met
during
the
afternoon
to
scout
this
crossing
upon
the
information
afforded
by
our
foreman
about
the
trail
cutters
these
scouts
accompanied
by
flood
had
turned
back
to
advise
the
ranger
squad
encamped
in
a
secluded
spot
about
ten
miles
northeast
of
the
colorado
crossing
they
had
only
arrived
late
the
day
before
and
this
was
their
first
meeting
with
any
trail
herd
to
secure
any
definite
information
hames
at
once
assumed
charge
of
the
herd
flood
gladly
rendering
every
assistance
possible
we
night
herded
as
usual
but
during
the
two
middle
guards
hames
sent
out
four
of
his
rangers
to
scout
the
immediate
outlying
country
though
as
we
expected
they
met
with
no
adventure
at
daybreak
the
rangers
threw
their
packs
into
our
wagon
and
their
loose
stock
into
our
and
riding
up
the
trail
a
mile
or
more
left
us
keeping
well
out
of
sight
we
were
all
hopeful
now
that
the
trail
cutters
of
the
day
before
would
make
good
their
word
and
return
in
this
hope
we
killed
time
for
several
hours
that
morning
grazing
the
cattle
and
holding
the
wagon
in
the
rear
sending
the
wagon
ahead
of
the
herd
had
been
agreed
on
as
the
signal
between
our
foreman
and
the
ranger
corporal
at
first
sight
of
any
posse
behind
us
we
were
beginning
to
despair
of
their
coming
when
a
dust
cloud
appeared
several
miles
back
down
the
trail
we
at
once
hurried
the
wagon
and
ahead
to
warn
the
rangers
and
allowed
the
cattle
to
string
out
nearly
a
mile
in
length
a
fortunate
rise
in
the
trail
gave
us
a
glimpse
of
the
cavalcade
in
our
rear
which
was
entirely
too
large
to
be
any
portion
of
outfit
and
shortly
we
were
overtaken
by
our
trail
cutters
of
the
day
before
now
increased
to
mounted
men
flood
was
intentionally
in
the
lead
of
the
herd
and
the
entire
outfit
galloped
forward
to
stop
the
cattle
when
they
had
nearly
reached
the
lead
flood
turned
back
and
met
the
rustlers
well
i
as
good
as
my
word
said
the
leader
and
i
here
to
trim
your
herd
as
i
promised
you
i
would
throw
off
and
hold
up
your
cattle
or
i
do
it
for
you
several
of
our
outfit
rode
up
at
this
juncture
in
time
to
hear
reply
if
you
think
you
equal
to
the
occasion
hold
them
up
yourself
if
i
had
as
big
an
outfit
you
have
i
would
ask
any
man
to
help
me
i
want
to
watch
a
colorado
river
outfit
work
a
herd
i
might
learn
something
my
outfit
will
take
a
rest
or
perhaps
hold
the
cut
or
otherwise
clerk
for
you
but
be
careful
and
claim
anything
that
you
are
not
certain
is
your
own
for
i
reserve
the
right
to
look
over
your
cut
before
you
drive
it
away
the
rustlers
rode
in
a
body
to
the
lead
and
when
they
had
thrown
the
herd
off
the
trail
about
half
of
them
rode
back
and
drifted
forward
the
rear
cattle
flood
called
our
outfit
to
one
side
and
gave
us
our
instructions
the
herd
being
entirely
turned
over
to
the
rustlers
after
they
began
cutting
we
rode
around
and
pretended
to
assist
in
holding
the
cut
as
the
strays
in
our
herd
were
being
cut
out
when
the
red
q
cow
came
out
fox
cut
her
back
which
nearly
precipitated
a
row
for
she
was
promptly
recut
to
the
strays
by
the
man
who
claimed
her
the
day
before
not
a
man
of
us
even
cast
a
glance
up
the
trail
or
in
the
direction
of
the
rangers
but
when
the
work
was
over
flood
protested
with
the
leader
of
the
rustlers
over
some
five
or
six
head
of
cattle
which
actually
belonged
to
our
herd
but
he
was
exultant
and
would
listen
to
no
protests
and
attempted
to
drive
away
the
cut
now
numbering
nearly
fifty
head
then
we
rode
across
their
front
and
stopped
them
in
the
parley
which
ensued
harsh
words
were
passing
when
one
of
our
outfit
blurted
out
in
well
feigned
surprise
hello
who
that
coming
over
there
a
squad
of
men
were
riding
leisurely
through
our
abandoned
herd
coming
over
to
where
the
two
outfits
were
disputing
what
the
trouble
here
gents
inquired
hames
as
he
rode
up
who
are
you
and
what
might
be
your
business

leader
of
the
rustlers

layout
lads
and
let
examine
them
more
closely
at
this
command
every
man
in
our
outfit
whipped
out
his
the
rangers
leveled
their
carbines
on
the
rustlers
and
in
less
than
a
minute
time
they
were
disarmed
and
as
crestfallen
a
group
of
men
as
ever
walked
into
a
trap
of
their
own
setting
hames
got
out
a
black
book
and
after
looking
the
crowd
over
concluded
to
hold
the
entire
covey
as
the
descriptions
of
the
wanted
seemed
to
include
most
of
them
some
of
the
rustlers
attempted
to
explain
their
presence
but
hames
decided
to
hold
the
entire
party
just
to
learn
them
to
be
more
careful
of
their
company
the
next
time
as
he
put
it
the
cut
had
drifted
away
into
the
herd
again
during
the
arrest
and
about
half
our
outfit
took
the
cattle
on
to
where
the
wagon
camped
for
noon
mccann
had
anticipated
an
extra
crowd
for
dinner
and
was
prepared
for
the
emergency
when
dinner
was
over
and
the
rangers
had
packed
and
were
ready
to
leave
hames
said
to
flood

chapter
viii
on
the
brazos
and
wichita
as
we
neared
buffalo
gap
a
few
days
later
a
deputy
sheriff
of
taylor
county
who
resided
at
the
gap
rode
out
and
met
us
he
brought
an
urgent
request
from
hames
to
flood
to
appear
as
a
witness
against
the
rustlers
who
were
to
be
given
a
preliminary
trial
at
abilene
the
following
day
much
as
he
regretted
to
leave
the
herd
for
even
a
single
night
our
foreman
finally
consented
to
go
to
further
his
convenience
we
made
a
long
evening
drive
camping
for
the
night
well
above
buffalo
gap
which
at
that
time
was
little
more
than
a
landmark
on
the
trail
the
next
day
we
made
an
easy
drive
and
passed
abilene
early
in
the
afternoon
where
flood
rejoined
us
but
refused
any
one
permission
to
go
into
town
with
the
exception
of
mccann
with
the
wagon
which
was
a
matter
of
necessity
it
was
probably
for
the
best
for
this
cow
town
had
the
reputation
of
setting
a
pace
that
left
the
wayfarer
purseless
and
breathless
to
say
nothing
about
headaches
though
our
foreman
had
not
reached
those
mature
years
in
life
when
the
pleasures
and
frivolities
of
dissipation
no
longer
allure
yet
it
was
but
natural
that
he
should
wish
to
keep
his
men
from
the
temptation
of
the
cup
that
cheers
and
the
wiles
of
the
siren
but
when
the
wagon
returned
that
evening
it
was
evident
that
our
foreman
was
human
for
with
a
box
of
cigars
which
were
promised
us
were
several
bottles
of
old
crow
after
crossing
the
clear
fork
of
the
brazos
a
few
days
later
we
entered
a
open
country
through
which
the
herd
made
splendid
progress
at
abilene
we
were
surprised
to
learn
that
our
herd
was
the
twentieth
that
had
passed
that
point
the
weather
so
far
on
our
trip
had
been
exceptionally
good
only
a
few
showers
had
fallen
and
those
during
the
daytime
but
we
were
now
nearing
a
country
in
which
rain
was
more
frequent
and
the
swollen
condition
of
several
small
streams
which
have
their
headwaters
in
the
staked
plains
was
an
intimation
to
us
of
recent
rains
to
the
westward
of
our
route
before
reaching
the
main
brazos
we
passed
two
other
herds
of
yearling
cattle
and
were
warned
of
the
impassable
condition
of
that
river
for
the
past
week
nothing
daunted
we
made
our
usual
drive
and
when
the
herd
camped
that
night
flood
after
scouting
ahead
to
the
river
returned
with
the
word
that
the
brazos
had
been
unfordable
for
over
a
week
five
herds
being
waterbound
as
we
were
then
nearly
twenty
miles
south
of
the
river
the
next
morning
we
threw
off
the
trail
and
turned
the
herd
to
the
northeast
hoping
to
strike
the
brazos
a
few
miles
above
round
timber
ferry
once
the
herd
was
started
and
their
course
for
the
day
outlined
to
our
point
men
by
definite
landmarks
flood
and
quince
forrest
set
out
to
locate
the
ferry
and
look
up
a
crossing
had
it
not
been
for
our
wagon
we
would
have
kept
the
trail
but
as
there
was
no
ferry
on
the
brazos
at
the
crossing
of
the
western
trail
it
was
a
question
either
of
waiting
or
of
making
this
detour
then
all
the
grazing
for
several
miles
about
the
crossing
was
already
taken
by
the
waterbound
herds
and
to
crowd
up
and
trespass
on
range
already
occupied
would
have
been
a
violation
of
an
unwritten
law
again
no
herd
took
kindly
to
another
attempting
to
pass
them
when
in
traveling
condition
the
herds
were
on
an
equality
our
foreman
had
conceived
the
scheme
of
getting
past
these
waterbound
herds
if
possible
which
would
give
us
a
clear
field
until
the
next
large
watercourse
was
reached
flood
and
forrest
returned
during
the
noon
hour
the
former
having
found
by
swimming
a
passable
ford
near
the
mouth
of
monday
creek
while
the
latter
reported
the
ferry
in
order
no
sooner
then
was
dinner
over
than
the
wagon
set
out
for
the
ferry
under
forrest
as
pilot
though
we
were
to
return
to
the
herd
once
the
ferry
was
sighted
the
mouth
of
monday
creek
was
not
over
ten
miles
below
the
regular
trail
crossing
on
the
brazos
and
much
nearer
our
noon
camp
than
the
regular
one
but
the
wagon
was
compelled
to
make
a
direct
elbow
first
turning
to
the
eastward
then
doubling
back
after
the
river
was
crossed
we
held
the
cattle
off
water
during
the
day
so
as
to
have
them
thirsty
when
they
reached
the
river
flood
had
swum
it
during
the
morning
and
warned
us
to
be
prepared
for
fifty
or
sixty
yards
of
swimming
water
in
crossing
when
within
a
mile
we
held
up
the
herd
and
changed
horses
every
man
picking
out
one
with
a
tested
ability
to
swim
those
of
us
who
were
expected
to
take
the
water
as
the
herd
entered
the
river
divested
ourselves
of
boots
and
clothing
which
we
intrusted
to
riders
in
the
rear
the
approach
to
crossing
was
gradual
but
the
opposite
bank
was
abrupt
with
only
a
narrow
passageway
leading
out
from
the
channel
as
the
current
was
certain
to
carry
the
swimming
cattle
downstream
we
must
to
make
due
allowance
take
the
water
nearly
a
hundred
yards
above
the
outlet
on
the
other
shore
all
this
was
planned
out
in
advance
by
our
foreman
who
now
took
the
position
of
point
man
on
the
right
hand
or
down
the
riverside
and
with
our
saddle
horses
in
the
immediate
lead
we
breasted
the
angry
brazos
the
water
was
shallow
as
we
entered
and
we
reached
nearly
the
middle
of
the
river
before
the
loose
saddle
horses
struck
swimming
water
honeyman
was
on
their
lee
and
with
the
cattle
crowding
in
their
rear
there
was
no
alternative
but
to
swim
a
loose
horse
swims
easily
however
and
our
readily
faced
the
current
though
it
was
swift
enough
to
carry
them
below
the
passageway
on
the
opposite
side
by
this
time
the
lead
cattle
were
adrift
and
half
a
dozen
of
us
were
on
their
lower
side
for
the
footing
under
the
cutbank
was
narrow
and
should
the
cattle
become
congested
on
landing
some
were
likely
to
drown
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
required
cool
heads
to
keep
the
trail
of
cattle
moving
into
the
water
and
the
passageway
clear
on
the
opposite
landing
while
they
were
crossing
the
herd
represented
a
large
letter
u
caused
by
the
force
of
the
current
drifting
the
cattle
downstream
or
until
a
foothold
was
secured
on
the
farther
side
those
of
us
fortunate
enough
to
have
good
swimming
horses
swam
the
river
a
dozen
times
and
then
after
the
herd
was
safely
over
swam
back
to
get
our
clothing
it
was
a
thrilling
experience
to
us
younger
lads
of
the
outfit
and
rather
attractive
but
the
elder
and
more
experienced
men
always
dreaded
swimming
rivers
their
reasons
were
made
clear
enough
when
a
fortnight
later
we
crossed
red
river
where
a
newly
made
grave
was
pointed
out
to
us
amongst
others
of
men
who
had
lost
their
lives
while
swimming
cattle
once
the
bulk
of
the
cattle
were
safely
over
with
no
danger
of
congestion
on
the
farther
bank
they
were
allowed
to
loiter
along
under
the
cutbank
and
drink
to
their
hearts
content
quite
a
number
strayed
above
the
passageway
and
in
order
to
rout
them
out
bob
blades
moss
strayhorn
and
i
rode
out
through
the
outlet
and
up
the
river
where
we
found
some
of
them
in
a
passageway
down
a
dry
arroyo
the
steers
had
found
a
soft
damp
place
in
the
bank
and
were
so
busy
horning
the
waxy
red
mud
that
they
hardly
noticed
our
approach
until
we
were
within
a
rod
of
them
we
halted
our
horses
and
watched
their
antics
the
kneeling
cattle
were
cutting
the
bank
viciously
with
their
horns
and
matting
their
heads
with
the
red
mud
but
on
discovering
our
presence
they
curved
their
tails
and
stampeded
out
as
playfully
as
young
lambs
on
a
hillside
can
you
sabe
where
the
fun
comes
in
to
a
steer
to
get
down
on
his
knees
in
the
mud
and
dirt
and
horn
the
bank
and
muss
up
his
curls
and
enjoy
it
like
that
inquired
strayhorn
of
blades
and
me
because
it
healthy
and
funny
besides
replied
bob
giving
me
a
cautious
wink
did
you
never
hear
of
people
taking
mud
baths
seen
dogs
eat
grass
have
you
well
it
something
on
the
same
order
now
if
i
was
a
student
of
the
nature
of
animals
like
you
are
i
get
off
my
horse
and
imagine
i
had
horns
and
scar
and
otherwise
mangle
that
mud
bank
shamefully
i
hold
your
horse
if
you
want
to
try
it
some
of
the
secrets
of
the
humor
of
cattle
might
be
revealed
to
you
the
banter
though
given
in
jest
was
too
much
for
this
member
of
a
craft
that
can
always
be
depended
on
to
do
foolish
things
and
when
we
rejoined
the
outfit
strayhorn
presented
a
sight
no
sane
man
save
a
member
of
our
tribe
ever
would
have
conceived
of
the
herd
had
scattered
over
several
thousand
acres
after
leaving
the
river
grazing
freely
and
so
remained
during
the
rest
of
the
evening
forrest
changed
horses
and
set
out
down
the
river
to
find
the
wagon
and
pilot
it
in
for
with
the
long
distance
that
mccann
had
to
cover
it
was
a
question
if
he
would
reach
us
before
dark
flood
selected
a
bed
ground
and
camp
about
a
mile
out
from
the
river
and
those
of
the
outfit
not
on
herd
dragged
up
an
abundance
of
wood
for
the
night
and
built
a
roaring
fire
as
a
beacon
to
our
absent
commissary
darkness
soon
settled
over
camp
and
the
prospect
of
a
supperless
night
was
confronting
us
the
first
guard
had
taken
the
herd
and
yet
there
was
no
sign
of
the
wagon
several
of
us
youngsters
then
mounted
our
night
horses
and
rode
down
the
river
a
mile
or
over
in
the
hope
of
meeting
mccann
we
came
to
a
steep
bank
caused
by
the
shifting
of
the
first
bottom
of
the
river
across
to
the
north
bank
rode
up
this
bluff
some
little
distance
dismounted
and
fired
several
shots
then
with
our
ears
to
the
earth
patiently
awaited
a
response
it
did
not
come
and
we
rode
back
again
hell
fire
and
little
fishes
said
joe
stallings
as
we
clambered
into
our
saddles
to
return
it
not
supper
or
breakfast
that
troubling
me
but
will
we
get
any
dinner
that
a
more
pregnant
question
it
must
have
been
after
midnight
when
i
was
awakened
by
the
braying
of
mules
and
the
rattle
of
the
wagon
to
hear
the
voices
of
forrest
and
mccann
mingled
with
the
rattle
of
chains
as
they
unharnessed
condemning
to
eternal
perdition
the
broken
country
on
the
north
side
of
the
brazos
between
round
timber
ferry
and
the
mouth
of
monday
creek
i
think
that
when
the
almighty
made
this
country
on
the
north
side
of
the
brazos
said
mccann
the
next
morning
at
breakfast
the
creator
must
have
grown
careless
or
else
made
it
out
of
odds
and
ends
just
a
hundred
and
one
of
these
dry
arroyos
that
you
ca
see
until
you
are
right
onto
them
they
would
bother
a
man
on
horseback
but
with
a
loaded
wagon
it
different
and
i
promise
you
all
right
now
that
if
forrest
had
come
out
and
piloted
me
in
you
might
have
tightened
up
your
belts
for
breakfast
and
drank
out
of
cow
tracks
and
smoked
cigarettes
for
nourishment
well
it
do
you
good
this
high
living
was
liable
to
spoil
some
of
you
but
i
notice
that
you
are
all
on
your
feed
this
morning
the
black
strap
honeyman
get
that
molasses
jug
out
of
the
wagon
it
sits
right
in
front
of
the
chuck
box
it
does
me
good
to
see
this
outfit
tastes
once
more
going
back
to
the
good
old
staples
of
life
we
made
our
usual
early
start
keeping
well
out
from
the
river
on
a
course
almost
due
northward
the
next
river
on
our
way
was
the
wichita
still
several
days
drive
from
the
mouth
of
monday
creek
flood
intention
was
to
parallel
the
old
trail
until
near
the
river
when
if
its
stage
of
water
was
not
fordable
we
would
again
seek
a
lower
crossing
in
the
hope
of
avoiding
any
waterbound
herds
on
that
watercourse
the
second
day
out
from
the
brazos
it
rained
heavily
during
the
day
and
drizzled
during
the
entire
night
not
a
hoof
would
bed
down
requiring
the
guards
to
be
doubled
into
two
watches
for
the
night
the
next
morning
as
was
usual
when
off
the
trail
flood
scouted
in
advance
and
near
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
drive
we
came
into
the
old
trail
the
weather
in
the
mean
time
had
faired
off
which
revived
life
and
spirit
in
the
outfit
for
in
trail
work
there
is
nothing
that
depresses
the
spirits
of
men
like
falling
weather
on
coming
into
the
trail
we
noticed
that
no
herds
had
passed
since
the
rain
began
shortly
afterward
our
rear
guard
was
overtaken
by
a
horseman
who
belonged
to
a
mixed
herd
which
was
encamped
some
four
or
five
miles
below
the
point
where
we
came
into
the
old
trail
he
reported
the
wichita
as
having
been
unfordable
for
the
past
week
but
at
that
time
falling
and
said
that
if
the
rain
of
the
past
few
days
had
not
extended
as
far
west
as
the
staked
plains
the
river
would
be
fordable
in
a
day
or
two
before
the
stranger
left
us
flood
returned
and
confirmed
this
information
and
reported
further
that
there
were
two
herds
lying
over
at
the
wichita
ford
expecting
to
cross
the
following
day
with
this
outlook
we
grazed
our
herd
up
to
within
five
miles
of
the
river
and
camped
for
the
night
and
our
visitor
returned
to
his
outfit
with
flood
report
of
our
expectation
of
crossing
on
the
morrow
but
with
the
fair
weather
and
the
prospects
of
an
easy
night
we
encamped
entirely
too
close
to
the
trail
as
we
experienced
to
our
sorrow
the
grazing
was
good
everywhere
the
recent
rains
having
washed
away
the
dust
and
we
should
have
camped
farther
away
we
were
all
sleepy
that
night
and
no
sooner
was
supper
over
than
every
mother
son
of
us
was
in
his
blankets
we
slept
so
soundly
that
the
guards
were
compelled
to
dismount
when
calling
the
relief
and
shake
the
next
guards
on
duty
out
of
their
slumber
and
see
that
they
got
up
for
men
would
unconsciously
answer
in
their
sleep
the
cattle
were
likewise
tired
and
slept
as
willingly
as
the
men
about
midnight
however
fox
quarternight
dashed
into
camp
firing
his
and
yelling
like
a
demon
we
tumbled
out
of
our
blankets
in
a
dazed
condition
to
hear
that
one
of
the
herds
camped
near
the
river
had
stampeded
the
heavy
rumbling
of
the
running
herd
and
the
shooting
of
their
outfit
now
being
distinctly
audible
we
lost
no
time
getting
our
horses
and
in
less
than
a
minute
were
riding
for
our
cattle
which
had
already
got
up
and
were
timidly
listening
to
the
approaching
noise
although
we
were
a
good
quarter
mile
from
the
trail
before
we
could
drift
our
herd
to
a
point
of
safety
the
stampeding
cattle
swept
down
the
trail
like
a
cyclone
and
our
herd
was
absorbed
into
the
maelstrom
of
the
onrush
like
leaves
in
a
whirlwind
it
was
then
that
our
mexican
steers
set
us
a
pace
that
required
a
good
horse
to
equal
for
they
easily
took
the
lead
the
other
herd
having
run
between
three
and
four
miles
before
striking
us
and
being
already
well
winded
the
other
herd
were
central
texas
cattle
and
numbered
over
hundred
but
in
running
capacity
were
never
any
match
for
ours
before
they
had
run
a
mile
past
our
camp
our
outfit
bunched
well
together
on
the
left
point
made
the
first
effort
to
throw
them
out
and
off
the
trail
and
try
to
turn
them
but
the
waves
of
an
angry
ocean
could
as
easily
have
been
brought
under
subjection
as
our
terrorized
herd
during
this
first
mad
dash
once
we
turned
a
few
hundred
of
the
leaders
and
about
the
time
we
thought
success
was
in
reach
another
contingent
of
double
the
number
had
taken
the
lead
then
we
had
to
abandon
what
few
we
had
and
again
ride
to
the
front
when
we
reached
the
lead
there
within
half
a
mile
ahead
burned
the
of
the
herd
of
mixed
cattle
which
had
moved
up
the
trail
that
evening
they
had
had
ample
warning
of
impending
trouble
just
as
we
had
and
before
the
running
cattle
reached
them
about
half
a
dozen
of
their
outfit
rode
to
our
assistance
when
we
made
another
effort
to
turn
or
hold
the
herds
from
mixing
none
of
the
outfit
of
the
first
herd
had
kept
in
the
lead
with
us
their
horses
fagging
and
when
the
foreman
of
this
mixed
herd
met
us
not
knowing
that
we
were
as
innocent
of
the
trouble
as
himself
he
made
some
slighting
remarks
about
our
outfit
and
cattle
but
it
was
no
time
to
be
sensitive
and
with
his
outfit
to
help
we
threw
our
whole
weight
against
the
left
point
a
second
time
but
only
turned
a
few
hundred
and
before
we
could
get
into
the
lead
again
their
campfire
had
been
passed
and
their
herd
of
over
three
thousand
cattle
more
were
in
the
run
as
cows
and
calves
predominated
in
this
mixed
herd
our
own
southerners
were
still
leaders
in
the
stampede
it
is
questionable
if
we
would
have
turned
this
stampede
before
daybreak
had
not
the
nature
of
the
country
come
to
our
assistance
something
over
two
miles
below
the
camp
of
the
last
herd
was
a
deep
creek
the
banks
of
which
were
steep
and
the
passages
few
and
narrow
here
we
succeeded
in
turning
the
leaders
and
about
half
the
outfit
of
the
mixed
herd
remained
guarding
the
crossing
and
turning
the
lagging
cattle
in
the
run
as
they
came
up
with
the
leaders
once
turned
and
no
chance
for
the
others
to
take
a
new
lead
we
had
the
entire
run
of
cattle
turned
back
within
an
hour
and
safely
under
control
the
first
outfit
joined
us
during
the
interim
and
when
day
broke
we
had
over
forty
men
drifting
about
ten
thousand
cattle
back
up
the
trail
the
different
outfits
were
unfortunately
at
loggerheads
no
one
being
willing
to
assume
any
blame
flood
hunted
up
the
foreman
of
the
mixed
herd
and
demanded
an
apology
for
his
remarks
on
our
abrupt
meeting
with
him
the
night
before
and
while
it
was
granted
it
was
plain
that
it
was
begrudged
the
first
herd
disclaimed
all
responsibility
holding
that
the
stampede
was
due
to
an
unavoidable
accident
their
cattle
having
grown
restless
during
their
enforced
the
indifferent
attitude
of
their
foreman
whose
name
was
wilson
won
the
friendly
regard
of
our
outfit
and
before
the
wagon
of
the
mixed
cattle
was
reached
there
was
a
compact
at
least
tacit
between
their
outfit
and
ours
our
foreman
was
not
blameless
for
had
we
taken
the
usual
precaution
and
camped
at
least
a
mile
off
the
trail
which
was
our
custom
when
in
close
proximity
to
other
herds
we
might
and
probably
would
have
missed
this
for
our
herd
was
inclined
to
be
very
tractable
flood
with
all
his
experience
well
knew
that
if
stampeded
cattle
ever
got
into
a
known
trail
they
were
certain
to
turn
backward
over
their
course
and
we
were
now
paying
the
fiddler
for
lack
of
proper
precaution
within
an
hour
after
daybreak
and
before
the
cattle
had
reached
the
camp
of
the
mixed
herd
our
saddle
horses
were
sighted
coming
over
a
slight
divide
about
two
miles
up
the
trail
and
a
minute
later
mccann
mules
hove
in
sight
bringing
up
the
rear
they
had
made
a
start
with
the
first
dawn
rightly
reasoning
as
there
was
no
time
to
leave
orders
on
our
departure
that
it
was
advisable
for
mahomet
to
go
to
the
mountain
flood
complimented
our
cook
and
horse
wrangler
on
their
foresight
for
the
wagon
was
our
base
of
sustenance
and
there
was
little
loss
of
time
before
barney
mccann
was
calling
us
to
a
hastily
prepared
breakfast
flood
asked
wilson
to
bring
his
outfit
to
our
wagon
for
breakfast
and
as
fast
as
they
were
relieved
from
herd
they
also
did
ample
justice
to
mccann
cooking
during
breakfast
i
remember
wilson
explaining
to
flood
what
he
believed
was
the
cause
of
the
stampede
it
seems
that
there
were
a
few
remaining
buffalo
ranging
north
of
the
wichita
and
at
night
when
they
came
into
the
river
to
drink
they
had
scented
the
cattle
on
the
south
side
the
bellowing
of
buffalo
bulls
had
been
distinctly
heard
by
his
men
on
night
herd
for
several
nights
past
the
foreman
stated
it
as
his
belief
that
a
number
of
bulls
had
swum
the
river
and
had
by
stealth
approached
near
the
sleeping
cattle
then
on
discovering
the
presence
of
the
herders
had
themselves
stampeded
throwing
his
herd
into
a
panic
we
had
got
a
change
of
mounts
during
the
breakfast
hour
and
when
all
was
ready
flood
and
wilson
rode
over
to
the
wagon
of
the
mixed
herd
the
two
outfits
following
when
flood
inquired
of
their
foreman
have
you
any
suggestions
to
make
in
the
cutting
of
these
herds
no
suggestions
was
the
reply
but
i
intend
to
cut
mine
first
and
cut
them
northward
on
the
trail
you
intend
to
cut
them
northward
you
mean
provided
there
are
no
objections
which
i
positive
there
will
be
said
flood
it
takes
me
some
little
time
to
size
a
man
up
and
the
more
i
see
of
you
during
our
brief
acquaintance
the
more
i
think
there
two
or
three
things
that
you
might
learn
to
your
advantage
i
not
enumerate
them
now
but
when
these
herds
are
separated
if
you
insist
it
will
cost
you
nothing
but
the
asking
for
my
opinion
of
you
this
much
you
can
depend
on
when
the
cutting
over
you
occupy
the
same
position
on
the
trail
that
you
did
before
this
accident
happened
wilson
here
has
nothing
but
jaded
horses
and
his
outfit
will
hold
the
herd
while
yours
and
mine
cut
their
cattle
and
instead
of
you
cutting
north
you
can
either
cut
south
where
you
belong
on
the
trail
or
sulk
in
your
camp
your
own
will
and
pleasure
to
govern
but
if
you
are
a
cowman
willing
to
do
your
part
you
have
your
outfit
ready
to
work
by
the
time
we
throw
the
cattle
together
not
waiting
for
any
reply
flood
turned
away
and
the
double
outfit
circled
around
the
grazing
herd
and
began
throwing
the
sea
of
cattle
into
a
compact
body
ready
to
work
rod
wheat
and
ash
borrowstone
were
detailed
to
hold
our
cut
and
the
remainder
of
us
including
honeyman
entered
the
herd
and
began
cutting
shortly
after
we
had
commenced
the
work
the
mixed
outfit
finding
themselves
in
a
lonesome
minority
joined
us
and
began
cutting
out
their
cattle
to
the
westward
when
we
had
worked
about
half
an
hour
flood
called
us
out
and
with
the
larger
portion
of
wilson
men
we
rode
over
and
drifted
the
mixed
cut
around
to
the
southward
where
they
belonged
the
mixed
outfit
pretended
they
meant
no
harm
and
were
politely
informed
that
if
they
were
sincere
they
could
show
it
more
plainly
for
nearly
three
hours
we
sent
a
steady
stream
of
cattle
out
of
the
main
herd
into
our
cut
while
our
horses
dripped
with
sweat
with
our
advantage
in
the
start
as
well
as
that
of
having
the
smallest
herd
we
finished
our
work
first
while
the
mixed
outfit
were
finishing
their
cutting
we
changed
mounts
and
then
were
ready
to
work
the
separated
herds
wilson
took
about
half
his
outfit
and
after
giving
our
herd
a
trimming
during
which
he
recut
about
twenty
the
mixed
outfit
were
given
a
similar
chance
and
found
about
half
a
dozen
of
their
brand
these
cattle
of
wilson
and
the
other
herd
amongst
ours
were
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
we
cut
by
a
liberal
rule
often
we
would
find
a
number
of
ours
on
the
outside
of
the
main
herd
when
two
men
would
cut
the
squad
in
a
bunch
and
if
there
was
a
wrong
brand
amongst
them
it
was
no
matter
we
knew
our
herd
would
have
to
be
retrimmed
anyhow
and
the
other
outfits
might
be
disappointed
if
they
found
none
of
their
cattle
amongst
ours
the
mixed
outfit
were
yet
working
our
herd
when
wilson
wagon
and
saddle
horses
arrived
and
while
they
were
changing
mounts
we
cut
the
mixed
herd
of
our
brand
and
picked
up
a
number
of
strays
which
we
had
been
nursing
along
though
when
we
first
entered
the
main
herd
strays
had
received
our
attention
being
well
known
to
us
by
ranch
brands
as
well
as
flesh
marks
in
gathering
up
this
very
natural
flotsam
of
the
trail
we
cut
nothing
but
what
our
herd
had
absorbed
in
its
travels
showing
due
regard
to
a
similar
right
of
the
other
herds
our
work
was
finished
first
and
after
wilson
had
recut
the
mixed
herd
we
gave
his
herd
one
more
looking
over
in
a
farewell
parting
flood
asked
him
if
he
wanted
the
lead
but
wilson
waived
his
right
in
his
open
frank
manner
saying
if
i
had
as
cattle
as
you
have
i
would
ask
no
man
for
the
privilege
of
passing
why
you
ought
to
horses
i
glad
to
have
met
you
and
your
outfit
personally
but
regret
the
incident
which
has
given
you
so
much
trouble
as
i
do
expect
to
go
farther
than
dodge
or
ogalalla
at
the
most
you
are
more
than
welcome
to
the
lead
and
if
you
or
any
of
these
rascals
in
your
outfit
are
ever
in
coryell
county
hunt
up
frank
wilson
of
the
block
bar
ranch
and
i
promise
you
a
drink
of
milk
or
something
stronger
if
possible
we
crossed
the
wichita
late
that
afternoon
there
being
not
over
fifty
feet
of
swimming
water
for
the
cattle
our
wagon
gave
us
the
only
trouble
for
the
load
could
not
well
be
lightened
and
it
was
an
imperative
necessity
to
cross
it
the
same
day
once
the
cattle
were
safely
over
and
a
few
men
left
to
graze
them
forward
the
remainder
of
the
outfit
collected
all
the
ropes
and
went
back
after
the
wagon
as
mules
are
always
unreliable
in
the
water
flood
concluded
to
swim
them
loose
we
lashed
the
wagon
box
securely
to
the
gearing
with
ropes
arranged
our
bedding
in
the
wagon
where
it
would
be
on
top
and
ran
the
wagon
by
hand
into
the
water
as
far
as
we
dared
without
flooding
the
wagon
box
two
men
with
guy
ropes
fore
and
aft
were
then
left
to
swim
with
the
wagon
in
order
to
keep
it
from
toppling
over
while
the
remainder
of
us
recrossed
to
the
farther
side
of
the
swimming
channel
and
fastened
our
lariats
to
two
long
ropes
from
the
end
of
the
tongue
we
took
a
wrap
on
the
pommels
of
our
saddles
with
the
loose
end
and
when
the
word
was
given
our
eight
horses
furnished
abundant
motive
power
and
the
wagon
floated
across
landing
high
and
dry
amid
the
shoutings
of
the
outfit
chapter
ix
doan
crossing
it
was
a
nice
open
country
between
the
wichita
and
pease
rivers
on
reaching
the
latter
we
found
an
easy
stage
of
water
for
crossing
though
there
was
every
evidence
that
the
river
had
been
on
a
recent
rise
the
débris
of
a
late
freshet
littering
the
cutbank
while
mark
could
be
easily
noticed
on
the
trees
along
the
river
bottom
summer
had
advanced
until
the
june
freshets
were
to
be
expected
and
for
the
next
month
we
should
be
fortunate
if
our
advance
was
not
checked
by
floods
and
falling
weather
the
fortunate
stage
of
the
pease
encouraged
us
however
to
hope
that
possibly
red
river
two
days
drive
ahead
would
be
fordable
the
day
on
which
we
expected
to
reach
it
flood
set
out
early
to
look
up
the
ford
which
had
then
been
in
use
but
a
few
years
and
which
in
later
days
was
known
as
crossing
on
red
river
our
foreman
returned
before
noon
and
reported
a
favorable
stage
of
water
for
the
herd
and
a
new
ferry
that
had
been
established
for
wagons
with
this
good
news
we
were
determined
to
put
that
river
behind
us
in
as
few
hours
as
possible
for
it
was
a
common
occurrence
that
a
river
which
was
fordable
at
night
was
the
reverse
by
daybreak
mccann
was
sent
ahead
with
the
wagon
but
we
held
the
saddle
horses
with
us
to
serve
as
leaders
in
taking
the
water
at
the
ford
the
cattle
were
strung
out
in
trailing
manner
nearly
a
mile
and
on
reaching
the
river
near
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
we
took
the
water
without
a
halt
or
even
a
change
of
horses
this
boundary
river
on
the
northern
border
of
texas
was
a
terror
to
trail
drovers
but
on
our
reaching
it
it
had
shallowed
down
the
flow
of
water
following
several
small
channels
one
of
these
was
swimming
with
shallow
bars
intervening
between
the
channels
but
the
majestic
grandeur
of
the
river
was
apparent
on
every
hand
with
its
red
bluff
banks
the
sediment
of
its
red
waters
marking
the
timber
along
its
course
while
the
driftwood
lodged
in
trees
and
high
on
the
banks
indicated
what
might
be
expected
when
she
became
sportive
or
angry
that
she
was
merciless
was
evident
for
although
this
crossing
had
been
in
use
only
a
year
or
two
when
we
forded
yet
five
graves
one
of
which
was
less
than
ten
days
made
attested
her
disregard
for
human
life
it
can
safely
be
asserted
that
at
this
and
lower
trail
crossings
on
red
river
the
lives
of
more
trail
men
were
lost
by
drowning
than
on
all
other
rivers
together
just
as
we
were
nearing
the
river
an
unknown
horseman
from
the
south
overtook
our
herd
it
was
evident
that
he
belonged
to
some
through
herd
and
was
looking
out
the
crossing
he
made
himself
useful
by
lending
a
hand
while
our
herd
was
fording
and
in
a
brief
conversation
with
flood
informed
him
that
he
was
one
of
the
hands
with
a
running
w
herd
gave
the
name
of
bill
mann
as
their
foreman
the
number
of
cattle
they
were
driving
and
reported
the
herd
as
due
to
reach
the
river
the
next
morning
he
wasted
little
time
with
us
but
recrossed
the
river
returning
to
his
herd
while
we
grazed
out
four
or
five
miles
and
camped
for
the
night
i
shall
never
forget
the
impression
left
in
my
mind
of
that
first
morning
after
we
crossed
red
river
into
the
indian
lands
the
country
was
as
primitive
as
in
the
first
day
of
its
creation
the
trail
led
up
a
divide
between
the
salt
and
north
forks
of
red
river
to
the
eastward
of
the
latter
stream
lay
the
reservation
of
the
apaches
kiowas
and
comanches
the
latter
having
been
a
terror
to
the
inhabitants
of
western
texas
they
were
a
warlike
tribe
as
the
records
of
the
texas
rangers
and
government
troops
will
verify
but
their
last
effective
dressing
down
was
given
them
in
a
fight
at
adobe
walls
by
a
party
of
buffalo
hunters
whom
they
hoped
to
surprise
as
we
wormed
our
way
up
this
narrow
divide
there
was
revealed
to
us
a
panorama
of
plain
and
watercourse
with
not
a
visible
evidence
that
it
had
ever
been
invaded
by
civilized
man
save
cattlemen
with
their
herds
antelope
came
up
in
bands
and
gratified
their
curiosity
as
to
who
these
invaders
might
be
while
old
solitary
buffalo
bulls
turned
tail
at
our
approach
and
lumbered
away
to
points
of
safety
very
few
herds
had
ever
passed
over
this
route
but
buffalo
trails
leading
downstream
deep
worn
by
generations
of
travel
were
to
be
seen
by
hundreds
on
every
hand
we
were
not
there
for
a
change
of
scenery
or
for
our
health
so
we
may
have
overlooked
some
of
the
beauties
of
the
landscape
but
we
had
a
keen
eye
for
the
things
of
our
craft
we
could
see
almost
back
to
the
river
and
several
times
that
morning
noticed
clouds
of
dust
on
the
horizon
flood
noticed
them
first
after
some
little
time
the
dust
clouds
arose
clear
and
distinct
and
we
were
satisfied
that
the
running
w
herd
had
forded
and
were
behind
us
not
more
than
ten
or
twelve
miles
away
at
dinner
that
noon
flood
said
he
had
a
notion
to
go
back
and
pay
mann
a
visit
why
i
not
seen
bill
mann
said
our
foreman
as
he
helped
himself
to
a
third
piece
of
fried
chicken
bacon
since
we
separated
two
years
ago
up
at
ogalalla
on
the
platte
i
just
like
the
best
in
the
world
to
drop
back
and
sleep
in
his
blankets
one
night
and
complain
of
his
chuck
then
i
like
to
tell
him
how
we
had
passed
them
starting
ten
days
drive
farther
south
he
must
have
been
amongst
those
herds
laying
over
on
the
brazos
why
do
you
go
then
said
fox
quarternight
half
the
outfit
could
hold
the
cattle
now
with
the
grass
and
water
we
in
at
present
i
go
you
one
for
luck
said
our
foreman
wrangler
rustle
in
your
horses
the
minute
you
through
eating
i
going
visiting
we
all
knew
what
horse
he
would
ride
and
when
he
dropped
his
rope
on
alazanito
he
had
not
only
picked
his
own
mount
of
twelve
but
the
top
horse
of
the
entire
a
chestnut
sorrel
fifteen
hands
and
an
inch
in
height
that
drew
his
first
breath
on
the
prairies
of
texas
no
man
who
sat
him
once
could
ever
forget
him
now
when
the
trail
is
a
lost
occupation
and
reverie
and
reminiscence
carry
the
mind
back
to
that
day
there
are
friends
and
faces
that
may
he
forgotten
but
there
are
horses
that
never
will
be
there
were
emergencies
in
which
the
horse
was
everything
his
rider
merely
the
accessory
but
together
man
and
horse
they
were
the
force
that
made
it
possible
to
move
the
millions
of
cattle
which
passed
up
and
over
the
various
trails
of
the
west
when
we
had
caught
our
horses
for
the
afternoon
and
flood
had
saddled
and
was
ready
to
start
he
said
to
us
you
fellows
just
mosey
along
up
the
trail
i
not
be
gone
long
but
when
i
get
back
i
shall
expect
to
find
everything
running
smooth
an
outfit
that
ca
run
itself
without
a
boss
ought
to
stay
at
home
and
do
the
milking
so
long
fellows
the
country
was
well
watered
and
when
rounded
the
cattle
into
the
bed
ground
that
night
they
were
actually
suffering
from
stomachs
gorged
with
grass
and
water
they
went
down
and
to
sleep
like
tired
children
one
man
could
have
held
them
that
night
we
all
felt
good
and
mccann
got
up
an
extra
spread
for
supper
we
even
had
dried
apples
for
dessert
mccann
had
talked
the
storekeeper
at
doan
where
we
got
our
last
supplies
out
of
some
extras
as
a
among
them
was
a
can
of
jam
he
sprung
this
on
us
as
a
surprise
bob
blades
toyed
with
the
empty
can
in
mingled
admiration
and
disgust
over
a
picture
on
the
paper
label
it
was
a
supper
scene
every
figure
wearing
full
dress
now
that
general
grant
said
he
pointing
with
his
finger
and
this
is
tom
ochiltree
i
ca
quite
make
out
this
other
duck
but
i
reckon
he
some
big
auger
a
senator
or
governor
maybe
them
old
girls
have
got
their
gall
with
them
that
style
of
dress
is
what
you
call
and
the
whole
passel
ought
to
be
ashamed
and
they
seem
to
be
enjoying
themselves
too
though
it
was
a
lovely
summer
night
we
had
a
fire
and
supper
over
the
conversation
ranged
wide
and
free
as
the
wagon
on
the
trail
is
home
naturally
the
fire
is
the
hearthstone
so
we
gathered
and
lounged
around
it
the
only
way
to
enjoy
such
a
fine
night
as
this
remarked
ash
is
to
sit
up
smoking
until
you
fall
asleep
with
your
boots
on
between
too
much
sleep
and
just
enough
there
a
happy
medium
which
suits
me
officer
inquired
wyatt
roundtree
trailing
into
the
conversation
very
innocently
why
is
it
that
people
who
live
up
among
those
yankees
always
say
the
remainder
of
their
lives
what
the
matter
with
the
word
countered
officer
oh
nothing
i
reckon
only
it
sounds
a
little
odd
and
there
a
tale
to
it
a
story
you
mean
said
officer
reprovingly
well
i
tell
it
to
you
said
roundtree
and
then
you
can
call
it
to
suit
yourself
it
was
out
in
new
mexico
where
this
happened
there
was
a
fellow
drifted
into
the
ranch
where
i
was
working
dead
broke
to
make
matters
worse
he
could
do
nothing
he
would
fit
anywhere
still
he
was
a
nice
fellow
and
we
all
liked
him
must
have
had
a
good
education
for
he
had
good
letters
from
people
up
north
he
had
worked
in
stores
and
had
once
clerked
in
a
bank
at
least
the
letters
said
so
well
we
put
up
a
job
to
get
him
a
place
in
a
little
town
out
on
the
railroad
you
all
know
how
clannish
kentuckians
are
let
two
meet
who
never
saw
each
other
before
and
inside
of
half
an
hour
they
be
chewing
tobacco
from
the
same
plug
and
trying
to
loan
each
other
money
that
just
like
them
interposed
fox
quarternight
well
there
was
an
old
man
lived
in
this
town
who
was
the
genuine
blend
of
bluegrass
and
bourbon
if
another
kentuckian
came
within
twenty
miles
of
him
and
he
found
it
out
he
hunt
him
up
and
hold
a
reunion
we
put
up
the
job
that
this
young
man
should
play
that
he
was
a
kentuckian
hoping
that
the
old
man
would
take
him
to
his
bosom
and
give
him
something
to
do
so
we
took
him
into
town
one
day
coached
and
fully
posted
how
to
act
and
play
his
part
we
met
the
old
man
in
front
of
his
place
of
business
and
after
the
usual
comment
on
the
news
over
our
way
weather
and
other
small
talk
we
were
on
the
point
of
passing
on
when
one
of
our
own
crowd
turned
back
and
inquired
henry
have
you
met
the
young
kentuckian
who
in
the
country
said
the
old
man
brightening
with
interest
is
he
and
where
is
he
in
town
somewhere
volunteered
one
of
the
boys
we
pretended
to
survey
the
street
from
where
we
stood
when
one
of
the
boys
blurted
out
he
stands
now
that
fellow
in
front
of
the
drug
store
over
there
with
the
hat
on
the
old
man
started
for
him
angling
across
the
street
in
disregard
of
sidewalks
we
watched
the
meeting
thinking
it
was
working
all
right
we
were
mistaken
we
saw
them
shake
hands
when
the
old
man
turned
and
walked
away
very
haughtily
something
had
gone
wrong
he
took
the
sidewalk
on
his
return
and
when
he
came
near
enough
to
us
we
could
see
that
he
was
angry
and
on
the
prod
when
he
came
near
enough
to
speak
he
said
think
you
smart
do
you
he
a
kentuckian
is
he
hell
full
of
such
kentuckians
and
as
he
passed
beyond
hearing
he
was
muttering
imprecations
on
us
the
young
fellow
joined
us
a
minute
later
with
the
question
kind
of
a
crank
is
that
you
ran
me
up
against
as
nice
a
man
as
there
is
in
this
country
said
one
of
the
crowd
did
you
say
to
him
he
came
up
to
me
extended
his
hand
saying
my
young
friend
i
understand
that
you
from
kentucky
i
be
sir
i
replied
when
he
looked
me
in
the
eye
and
said
you
a
g
d
liar
and
turned
and
walked
away
why
he
must
have
wanted
to
insult
me
and
then
we
all
knew
why
our
little
scheme
had
failed
there
was
food
and
raiment
in
it
for
him
but
he
would
use
that
little
word
did
any
of
you
notice
my
saddle
horse
lie
down
just
after
we
crossed
this
last
creek
this
afternoon
inquired
rod
wheat
no
what
made
him
lie
down
asked
several
of
the
boys
oh
he
just
found
a
gopher
hole
and
stuck
his
forefeet
into
it
one
at
a
time
and
then
tried
to
pull
them
both
out
at
once
and
when
he
could
do
it
he
simply
shut
his
eyes
like
a
dying
sheep
and
lay
down
then
you
seen
sheep
die
said
the
horse
wrangler
of
course
i
have
a
sheep
can
die
any
time
he
makes
up
his
mind
to
by
simply
shutting
both
eyes
then
he
a
goner
quince
forrest
who
had
brought
in
his
horse
to
go
out
with
the
second
watch
he
and
bob
blades
having
taken
advantage
of
the
absence
to
change
places
on
guard
for
the
night
had
been
listening
to
the
latter
part
of
wyatt
yarn
very
attentively
we
all
hoped
that
he
would
mount
and
ride
out
to
the
herd
for
though
he
was
a
good
and
meaty
with
personal
experiences
where
he
thought
they
would
pass
muster
he
was
inclined
to
overcolor
his
statements
we
usually
gave
him
respectful
attention
but
were
frequently
compelled
to
regard
him
as
a
cheerful
harmless
liar
so
when
he
showed
no
disposition
to
go
we
knew
we
were
in
for
one
from
him
when
i
was
boss
he
began
for
a
big
army
sutler
at
fort
concho
i
used
to
make
two
round
trips
a
month
with
my
train
it
was
a
hundred
miles
to
wagon
from
the
freight
point
where
we
got
our
supplies
i
had
ten
teams
six
and
seven
yoke
to
the
team
and
trail
wagons
to
each
i
was
furnished
a
night
herder
and
a
cook
saddle
horses
for
both
night
herder
and
myself
you
hear
me
it
was
a
slam
up
fine
layout
we
could
handle
three
or
four
tons
to
the
team
and
with
the
whole
train
we
could
chamber
two
car
loads
of
anything
one
day
we
were
nearing
the
fort
with
a
mixed
cargo
of
freight
when
a
messenger
came
out
and
met
us
with
an
order
from
the
sutler
he
wanted
us
to
make
the
fort
that
night
and
unload
the
mail
buckboard
had
reported
us
to
the
sutler
as
camped
out
back
on
a
little
creek
about
ten
miles
we
were
always
entitled
to
a
day
to
unload
and
drive
back
to
camp
which
gave
us
good
grass
for
the
oxen
but
under
the
orders
the
whips
popped
merrily
that
afternoon
and
when
they
all
got
well
strung
out
i
rode
in
ahead
to
see
what
was
up
well
it
seems
that
four
companies
of
infantry
from
fort
mckavett
which
were
out
for
field
practice
were
going
to
be
brought
into
this
post
to
be
paid
three
months
wages
this
with
the
troops
stationed
at
concho
would
turn
loose
quite
a
wad
of
money
the
sutler
called
me
into
his
office
when
i
reached
the
fort
and
when
he
had
produced
a
black
bottle
used
for
cutting
the
alkali
in
your
drinking
water
he
said
he
called
me
jack
my
full
name
is
john
quincy
forrest
can
you
make
the
round
trip
and
bring
in
two
cars
of
bottled
beer
that
will
be
on
the
track
waiting
for
you
and
get
back
by
pay
day
the
i
figured
the
time
in
my
mind
it
was
twelve
days
five
extra
in
it
for
each
man
for
the
trip
and
i
make
it
right
with
you
he
added
as
he
noticed
my
hesitation
though
i
was
only
making
a
mental
calculation
certainly
captain
i
said
that
fable
about
the
jack
rabbit
and
the
land
tarrapin
he
did
know
and
i
did
either
so
i
said
to
illustrate
the
point
your
freight
on
a
bull
train
and
it
always
goes
through
on
time
a
race
horse
ca
beat
an
ox
on
a
hundred
miles
and
repeat
to
a
freight
wagon
well
we
unloaded
before
night
and
it
was
pitch
dark
before
we
made
camp
i
explained
the
situation
to
the
men
we
planned
to
go
in
empty
in
five
days
which
would
give
us
seven
to
come
back
loaded
we
made
every
camp
on
time
like
clockwork
the
fifth
morning
we
were
anxious
to
get
a
daybreak
start
so
we
could
load
at
night
the
night
herder
had
his
orders
to
bring
in
the
oxen
the
first
sign
of
day
and
i
called
the
cook
an
hour
before
light
when
the
oxen
were
brought
in
the
men
were
up
and
ready
to
go
to
yoking
but
the
nigh
wheeler
in
joe
jenk
team
a
big
brindle
muley
ox
a
regular
pet
steer
was
missing
i
saw
him
myself
joe
saw
him
and
the
night
herder
swore
he
came
in
with
the
rest
well
we
looked
high
and
low
for
that
ox
but
he
had
vanished
while
the
men
were
eating
their
breakfast
i
got
on
my
horse
and
the
night
herder
and
i
scoured
and
circled
that
country
for
miles
around
but
no
ox
the
country
was
so
bare
and
level
that
a
jack
rabbit
needed
to
carry
a
fly
for
shade
i
was
worried
for
we
needed
every
ox
and
every
moment
of
time
i
ordered
joe
to
tie
his
mate
behind
the
trail
wagon
and
pull
out
one
ox
shy
well
fellows
that
thing
worried
me
powerful
half
the
teamsters
good
honest
truthful
men
as
ever
popped
a
whip
swore
they
saw
that
ox
when
they
came
in
well
it
served
a
strong
argument
that
a
man
can
be
positive
and
yet
be
mistaken
we
nooned
ten
miles
from
our
night
camp
that
day
jerry
wilkens
happened
to
mention
it
at
dinner
that
he
believed
his
trail
needed
greasing
said
jerry
think
that
i
was
loaded
the
way
my
team
kept
their
chains
taut
i
noticed
joe
get
up
from
dinner
before
he
had
finished
as
if
an
idea
had
struck
him
he
went
over
and
opened
the
sheet
in
jerry
trail
wagon
and
a
smile
spread
over
his
countenance
here
fellows
was
all
he
said
we
ran
over
to
the
wagon
and
there
the
boys
turned
their
backs
with
indistinct
mutterings
of
disgust
you
all
do
need
to
believe
this
if
you
do
want
to
but
there
was
the
missing
ox
coiled
up
and
sleeping
like
a
bear
in
the
wagon
he
even
had
jerry
roll
of
bedding
for
a
pillow
you
see
the
wagon
sheet
was
open
in
front
and
he
had
hopped
up
on
the
trail
tongue
and
crept
in
there
to
steal
a
ride
joe
climbed
into
the
wagon
and
gave
him
a
few
swift
kicks
in
the
short
ribs
when
he
opened
his
eyes
yawned
got
up
and
jumped
out
bull
was
rolling
a
cigarette
before
starting
while
fox
night
horse
was
hard
to
bridle
which
hindered
them
with
this
slight
delay
forrest
turned
his
horse
back
and
continued
that
same
ox
on
the
next
trip
one
night
when
we
had
the
wagons
parked
into
a
corral
got
away
from
the
herder
over
the
men
beds
in
the
gate
stood
on
his
hind
legs
long
enough
to
eat
four
sacks
of
flour
out
of
the
rear
end
of
a
wagon
got
down
on
his
side
and
wormed
his
way
under
the
wagon
back
into
the
herd
without
being
detected
or
waking
a
man
as
they
rode
away
to
relieve
the
first
guard
mccann
said
is
he
a
daisy
if
i
loved
a
liar
i
hug
that
man
to
death
the
absence
of
our
foreman
made
no
difference
we
all
knew
our
places
on
guard
experience
told
us
there
would
be
no
trouble
that
night
after
wyatt
roundtree
and
moss
strayhorn
had
made
down
their
bed
and
got
into
it
wyatt
remarked
did
you
ever
notice
old
sidey
how
hard
this
ground
is
oh
yes
said
moss
as
he
turned
over
hunting
for
a
soft
spot
it
is
hard
but
we
forget
all
that
when
this
trip
ends
brother
dear
just
think
of
those
long
slings
with
red
cherries
floating
around
in
them
that
we
be
drinking
and
picture
us
smoking
cigars
in
a
blaze
that
thought
alone
ought
to
make
a
hard
bed
both
soft
and
warm
then
to
think
we
ride
all
the
way
home
on
the
cars
mccann
banked
his
fire
and
the
first
guard
wheat
stallings
and
borrowstone
rode
in
from
the
herd
all
singing
an
old
chorus
that
had
been
composed
with
little
regard
for
music
or
sense
about
a
hotel
where
they
had
stopped
the
year
before
sure
it
one
cent
for
coffee
and
two
cents
for
bread
three
for
a
steak
and
five
for
a
bed
sea

the
festive

in
the
southwestern
hotel
chapter
x
no
man
land
flood
overtook
us
the
next
morning
and
as
a
number
of
us
gathered
round
him
to
hear
the
news
told
us
of
a
letter
that
mann
had
got
at
doan
stating
that
the
first
herd
to
pass
camp
supply
had
been
harassed
by
indians
the
running
w
people
mann
employers
had
a
representative
at
dodge
who
was
authority
for
the
statement
flood
had
read
the
letter
which
intimated
that
an
appeal
would
be
made
to
the
government
to
send
troops
from
either
camp
supply
or
fort
sill
to
give
trail
herds
a
safe
escort
in
passing
the
western
border
of
this
indian
reservation
the
letter
therefore
admonished
mann
if
he
thought
the
indians
would
give
any
trouble
to
go
up
the
south
side
of
red
river
as
far
as
the
of
texas
and
then
turn
north
to
the
government
trail
at
fort
elliot
i
told
mann
said
our
foreman
that
before
i
take
one
step
backward
or
go
off
on
a
wild
goose
chase
through
that
country
i
go
back
home
and
start
over
next
year
on
the
chisholm
trail
it
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
for
some
big
auger
to
sit
in
a
hotel
somewhere
and
direct
the
management
of
a
herd
i
do
look
for
no
soldiers
to
furnish
an
escort
it
would
take
the
government
six
months
to
get
a
move
on
her
even
in
an
emergency
i
left
billy
mann
in
a
quandary
he
does
know
what
to
do
that
big
auger
at
dodge
is
troubling
him
for
if
he
do
act
on
his
advice
and
loses
cattle
as
the
result
well
he
never
boss
any
more
herds
for
king
and
kennedy
so
boys
if
we
ever
to
see
the
blackfoot
agency
but
one
course
for
us
to
take
and
that
straight
ahead
as
old
oliver
loving
the
first
texas
cowman
that
ever
drove
a
herd
used
to
say
borrow
trouble
or
cross
a
river
before
you
reach
it
so
when
the
cattle
are
through
grazing
let
them
hit
the
trail
north
it
entirely
too
late
for
us
to
veer
away
from
any
indians
we
were
following
the
regular
trail
which
had
been
slightly
used
for
a
year
or
two
though
none
of
our
outfit
had
ever
been
over
it
when
late
on
the
third
afternoon
about
forty
miles
out
from
doan
about
a
hundred
mounted
bucks
and
squaws
sighted
our
herd
and
crossed
the
north
fork
from
their
encampment
they
did
not
ride
direct
to
the
herd
but
came
into
the
trail
nearly
a
mile
above
the
cattle
so
it
was
some
little
time
from
our
first
sighting
them
before
we
met
we
did
not
check
the
herd
or
turn
out
of
the
trail
but
when
the
lead
came
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
indians
one
buck
evidently
the
chief
of
the
band
rode
forward
a
few
rods
and
held
up
one
hand
as
if
commanding
a
halt
at
the
sight
of
this
gaudily
bedecked
apparition
the
cattle
turned
out
of
the
trail
and
flood
and
i
rode
up
to
the
chief
extending
our
hands
in
friendly
greeting
the
chief
could
not
speak
a
word
of
english
but
made
signs
with
his
hands
when
i
turned
loose
on
him
in
spanish
however
he
instantly
turned
his
horse
and
signed
back
to
his
band
two
young
bucks
rode
forward
and
greeted
flood
and
myself
in
good
spanish
on
thus
opening
up
an
intelligible
conversation
i
called
fox
quarternight
who
spoke
spanish
and
he
rode
up
from
his
position
of
third
man
in
the
swing
and
joined
in
the
council
the
two
young
indians
through
whom
we
carried
on
the
conversation
were
apaches
no
doubt
renegades
of
that
tribe
and
while
we
understood
each
other
in
spanish
they
spoke
in
a
heavy
guttural
peculiar
to
the
indian
flood
opened
the
powwow
by
demanding
to
know
the
meaning
of
this
visit
when
the
question
had
been
properly
interpreted
to
the
chief
the
latter
dropped
his
blanket
from
his
shoulders
and
dismounted
from
his
horse
he
was
a
fine
specimen
of
the
plains
indian
fully
six
feet
in
height
perfectly
proportioned
and
in
years
well
past
middle
life
he
looked
every
inch
a
chief
and
was
a
natural
born
orator
there
was
a
certain
easy
grace
to
his
gestures
only
to
be
seen
in
people
who
use
the
sign
language
and
often
when
he
was
speaking
to
the
apache
interpreters
i
could
anticipate
his
requests
before
they
were
translated
to
us
although
i
did
not
know
a
word
of
comanche
before
the
powwow
had
progressed
far
it
was
evident
that
begging
was
its
object
in
his
prelude
the
chief
laid
claim
to
all
the
country
in
sight
as
the
hunting
grounds
of
the
comanche
tribe
an
intimation
that
we
were
intruders
he
spoke
of
the
great
slaughter
of
the
buffalo
by
the
white
and
the
consequent
hunger
and
poverty
amongst
his
people
he
dwelt
on
the
fact
that
he
had
ever
counseled
peace
with
the
whites
until
now
his
band
numbered
but
a
few
squaws
and
papooses
the
younger
men
having
deserted
him
for
other
chiefs
of
the
tribe
who
advocated
war
on
the
palefaces
when
he
had
fully
stated
his
position
he
offered
to
allow
us
to
pass
through
his
country
in
consideration
of
ten
beeves
on
receiving
this
proposition
all
of
us
dismounted
including
the
two
apaches
the
latter
seating
themselves
in
their
own
fashion
while
we
whites
lounged
on
the
ground
in
truly
american
laziness
rolling
cigarettes
in
dealing
with
people
who
know
not
the
value
of
time
the
civilized
man
is
taken
at
a
disadvantage
and
unless
he
can
show
an
equal
composure
in
wasting
time
results
will
be
against
him
flood
had
had
years
of
experience
in
dealing
with
mexicans
in
the
land
of
where
all
maxims
regarding
the
value
of
time
are
religiously
discarded
so
in
dealing
with
this
indian
chief
he
showed
no
desire
to
hasten
matters
and
carefully
avoided
all
reference
to
the
demand
for
beeves
illustration
meeting
with
indians
his
first
question
instead
was
to
know
the
distance
to
fort
sill
and
fort
elliot
the
next
was
how
many
days
it
would
take
for
cavalry
to
reach
him
he
then
had
us
narrate
the
fact
that
when
the
first
herd
of
cattle
passed
through
the
country
less
than
a
month
before
some
bad
indians
had
shown
a
very
unfriendly
spirit
they
had
taken
many
of
the
cattle
and
had
killed
and
eaten
them
and
now
the
great
white
chief
at
washington
was
very
much
displeased
if
another
single
ox
were
taken
and
killed
by
bad
indians
he
would
send
his
soldiers
from
the
forts
to
protect
the
cattle
even
though
their
owners
drove
the
herds
through
the
reservation
of
the
indians
over
the
grass
where
their
ponies
grazed
he
had
us
inform
the
chief
that
our
entire
herd
was
intended
by
the
great
white
man
chief
at
washington
as
a
present
to
the
blackfeet
indians
who
lived
in
montana
because
they
were
good
indians
and
welcomed
priests
and
teachers
amongst
them
to
teach
them
the
ways
of
the
white
man
at
our
foreman
request
we
then
informed
the
chief
that
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
give
him
even
a
single
beef
for
any
privilege
of
passing
through
his
country
but
as
the
squaws
and
little
papooses
were
hungry
he
would
give
him
two
beeves
the
old
chief
seemed
not
the
least
disconcerted
but
begged
for
five
beeves
as
many
of
the
squaws
were
in
the
encampment
across
the
north
fork
those
present
being
not
quite
half
of
his
village
it
was
now
getting
late
in
the
day
and
the
band
seemed
to
be
getting
tired
of
the
parleying
a
number
of
squaws
having
already
set
out
on
their
return
to
the
village
after
some
further
talk
flood
agreed
to
add
another
beef
on
condition
they
be
taken
to
the
encampment
before
being
killed
this
was
accepted
and
at
once
the
entire
band
set
up
a
chattering
in
view
of
the
coming
feast
the
cattle
had
in
the
mean
time
grazed
off
nearly
a
mile
the
outfit
however
holding
them
under
a
close
herd
during
the
powwowing
all
the
bucks
in
the
band
numbering
about
forty
now
joined
us
and
we
rode
away
to
the
herd
i
noticed
by
the
way
that
quite
a
number
of
the
younger
braves
had
arms
and
no
doubt
they
would
have
made
a
display
of
force
had
diplomacy
been
of
a
more
warlike
character
while
drifting
the
herd
back
to
the
trail
we
cut
out
a
big
lame
steer
and
two
stray
cows
for
the
indians
who
now
left
us
and
followed
the
beeves
which
were
being
driven
to
their
village
flood
had
instructed
quarternight
and
me
to
invite
the
two
apaches
to
our
camp
for
the
night
on
the
promise
of
sugar
coffee
and
tobacco
they
consulted
with
the
old
chief
and
gaining
his
consent
came
with
us
we
extended
the
hospitality
of
our
wagon
to
our
guests
and
when
supper
was
over
promised
them
an
extra
beef
if
they
would
give
us
particulars
of
the
trail
until
it
crossed
the
north
fork
after
that
river
turned
west
towards
the
it
was
evident
that
they
were
familiar
with
the
country
for
one
of
them
accepted
our
offer
and
with
his
finger
sketched
a
rude
map
on
the
ground
where
there
had
formerly
been
a
he
outlined
the
two
rivers
between
which
we
were
then
encamped
and
traced
the
trail
until
it
crossed
the
north
fork
or
beyond
the
indian
reservation
we
discussed
the
outline
of
the
trail
in
detail
for
an
hour
asking
hundreds
of
unimportant
questions
but
occasionally
getting
in
a
leading
one
always
resulting
in
the
information
wanted
we
learned
that
the
big
summer
encampment
of
the
comanches
and
kiowas
was
one
day
ride
for
a
pony
or
two
days
with
cattle
up
the
trail
at
the
point
where
the
divide
between
salt
and
north
fork
narrows
to
about
ten
miles
in
width
we
leeched
out
of
them
very
cautiously
the
information
that
the
encampment
was
a
large
one
and
that
all
herds
this
year
had
given
up
cattle
some
as
many
as
head
having
secured
the
information
we
wanted
flood
gave
to
each
apache
a
package
of
arbuckle
coffee
a
small
sack
of
sugar
and
both
smoking
and
chewing
tobacco
quarternight
informed
them
that
as
the
cattle
were
bedded
for
the
night
they
had
better
remain
until
morning
when
he
would
pick
them
out
a
nice
fat
beef
on
their
consenting
fox
stripped
the
wagon
sheet
off
the
wagon
and
made
them
a
good
bed
in
which
with
their
body
blankets
they
were
as
comfortable
as
any
of
us
neither
of
them
was
armed
so
we
felt
no
fear
of
them
and
after
they
had
lain
down
on
their
couch
flood
called
quarternight
and
me
and
we
strolled
out
into
the
darkness
and
reviewed
the
information
we
agreed
that
the
topography
of
the
country
they
had
given
was
most
likely
correct
because
we
could
verify
much
of
it
by
maps
in
our
possession
another
thing
on
which
we
agreed
was
that
there
was
some
means
of
communication
between
this
small
and
seemingly
peaceable
band
and
the
main
encampment
of
the
tribe
and
that
more
than
likely
our
approach
would
be
known
in
the
large
encampment
before
sunrise
in
spite
of
the
good
opinion
we
entertained
of
our
guests
we
were
also
satisfied
they
had
lied
to
us
when
they
denied
they
had
been
in
the
large
camp
since
the
trail
herds
began
to
pass
this
was
the
last
question
we
had
asked
and
the
artful
manner
in
which
they
had
parried
it
showed
our
guests
to
be
no
mean
diplomats
themselves
our
camp
was
astir
by
daybreak
and
after
breakfast
as
we
were
catching
our
mounts
for
the
day
one
of
the
apaches
offered
to
take
a
certain
pinto
horse
in
our
in
lieu
of
the
promised
beef
but
flood
declined
the
offer
on
overtaking
the
herd
after
breakfast
quarternight
cut
out
a
fat
two
year
old
stray
heifer
and
he
and
i
assisted
our
guests
to
drive
their
beef
several
miles
toward
their
village
finally
bidding
them
farewell
we
returned
to
the
herd
when
the
outfit
informed
us
that
flood
and
the
rebel
had
ridden
on
ahead
to
look
out
a
crossing
on
the
salt
fork
from
this
move
it
was
evident
that
if
a
passable
ford
could
be
found
our
foreman
intended
to
abandon
the
established
route
and
avoid
the
big
indian
encampment
on
the
return
of
priest
and
flood
about
noon
they
reported
having
found
an
easy
ford
of
the
salt
fork
which
from
the
indications
of
their
old
trails
centring
from
every
quarter
at
this
crossing
must
have
been
used
by
buffalo
for
generations
after
dinner
we
put
our
wagon
in
the
lead
and
following
close
at
hand
with
the
cattle
turned
off
the
trail
about
a
mile
above
our
noon
camp
and
struck
to
the
westward
for
the
crossing
this
we
reached
and
crossed
early
that
evening
camping
out
nearly
five
miles
to
the
west
of
the
river
rain
was
always
to
be
dreaded
in
trail
work
and
when
bedding
down
the
herd
that
night
we
had
one
of
the
heaviest
downpours
which
we
had
experienced
since
leaving
the
rio
grande
it
lasted
several
hours
but
we
stood
it
uncomplainingly
for
this
fortunate
drenching
had
obliterated
every
trace
left
by
our
wagon
and
herd
since
abandoning
the
trail
as
well
as
the
sign
left
at
the
old
buffalo
crossing
on
the
salt
fork
the
rain
ceased
about
ten
when
the
cattle
bedded
down
easily
and
the
second
guard
took
them
for
their
watch
wood
was
too
scarce
to
afford
a
fire
and
while
our
slickers
had
partially
protected
us
from
the
rain
many
of
us
went
to
bed
in
wet
clothing
that
night
after
another
half
day
drive
to
the
west
we
turned
northward
and
traveled
in
that
direction
through
a
nice
country
more
or
less
broken
with
small
hills
but
well
watered
on
the
morning
of
the
first
day
after
turning
north
honeyman
reported
a
number
of
our
saddle
horses
had
strayed
from
camp
this
gave
flood
some
little
uneasiness
and
a
number
of
us
got
on
our
night
horses
without
loss
of
time
and
turned
out
to
look
up
the
missing
saddle
stock
the
rebel
and
i
set
out
together
to
the
southward
while
others
of
the
outfit
set
off
to
the
other
points
of
the
compass
i
was
always
a
good
trailer
was
in
fact
acknowledged
to
be
one
of
the
best
with
the
exception
of
my
brother
zack
on
the
san
antonio
river
where
we
grew
up
as
boys
in
circling
about
that
morning
i
struck
the
trail
of
about
twenty
horses
the
missing
number
and
at
once
signaled
to
priest
who
was
about
a
mile
distant
to
join
me
the
ground
was
fortunately
fresh
from
the
recent
rain
and
left
an
easy
trail
we
galloped
along
it
easily
for
some
little
distance
when
the
trail
suddenly
turned
and
we
could
see
that
the
horses
had
been
running
having
evidently
received
a
sudden
scare
on
following
up
the
trail
nearly
a
mile
we
noticed
where
they
had
quieted
down
and
had
evidently
grazed
for
several
hours
but
in
looking
up
the
trail
by
which
they
had
left
these
parts
priest
made
the
discovery
of
signs
of
cattle
we
located
the
trail
of
the
horses
soon
and
were
again
surprised
to
find
that
they
had
been
running
as
before
though
the
trail
was
much
fresher
having
possibly
been
made
about
dawn
we
ran
the
trail
out
until
it
passed
over
a
slight
divide
when
there
before
us
stood
the
missing
horses
they
never
noticed
us
but
were
standing
at
attention
cautiously
sniffing
the
early
morning
air
on
which
was
borne
to
them
the
scent
of
something
they
feared
on
reaching
them
their
fear
seemed
not
the
least
appeased
and
my
partner
and
i
had
our
curiosity
sufficiently
aroused
to
ride
forward
to
the
cause
of
their
alarm
as
we
rounded
the
spur
of
the
hill
there
in
plain
view
grazed
a
band
of
about
twenty
buffalo
we
were
almost
as
excited
as
the
horses
over
the
discovery
by
dropping
back
and
keeping
the
hill
between
us
and
them
then
dismounting
and
leaving
our
horses
we
thought
we
could
reach
the
apex
of
the
hill
it
was
but
a
small
elevation
and
from
its
summit
we
secured
a
splendid
view
of
the
animals
now
less
than
three
hundred
yards
distant
flattening
ourselves
out
we
spent
several
minutes
watching
the
shaggy
animals
as
they
grazed
leisurely
forward
while
several
calves
in
the
bunch
gamboled
around
their
mothers
a
buffalo
calf
i
had
always
heard
made
delicious
veal
and
as
we
had
had
no
fresh
meat
since
we
had
started
i
proposed
to
priest
that
we
get
one
he
suggested
trying
our
ropes
for
if
we
could
ever
get
within
effective
range
a
rope
was
much
the
surest
certainly
such
cumbrous
awkward
looking
animals
he
said
could
be
no
match
for
our
texas
horses
we
accordingly
dropped
back
off
the
hill
to
our
saddle
stock
when
priest
said
that
if
he
only
had
a
certain
horse
of
his
out
of
the
band
we
had
been
trailing
he
would
promise
me
buffalo
veal
if
he
had
to
follow
them
to
the
it
took
us
but
a
few
minutes
to
return
to
our
horses
round
them
in
and
secure
the
particular
horse
he
wanted
i
was
riding
my
nigger
boy
my
regular
night
horse
and
as
only
one
of
my
mount
was
in
this
bunch
a
good
horse
but
sluggish
i
concluded
to
give
my
black
a
trial
not
depending
on
his
speed
so
much
as
his
staying
qualities
it
took
but
a
minute
for
the
rebel
to
shift
his
saddle
from
one
horse
to
another
when
he
started
around
to
the
south
while
i
turned
to
the
north
so
as
to
approach
the
buffalo
simultaneously
i
came
in
sight
of
the
band
first
my
partner
having
a
farther
ride
to
make
but
had
only
a
few
moments
to
wait
before
i
noticed
the
quarry
take
alarm
and
the
next
instant
priest
dashed
out
from
behind
a
spur
of
the
hill
and
was
after
them
i
following
suit
they
turned
westward
and
when
the
rebel
and
i
came
together
on
the
angle
of
their
course
we
were
several
hundred
yards
in
their
rear
my
bunkie
had
the
best
horse
in
speed
by
all
odds
and
was
soon
crowding
the
band
so
close
that
they
began
to
scatter
and
though
i
passed
several
old
bulls
and
cows
it
was
all
i
could
do
to
keep
in
sight
of
the
calves
after
the
chase
had
continued
over
a
mile
the
staying
qualities
of
my
horse
began
to
shine
but
while
i
was
nearing
the
lead
the
rebel
tied
to
the
largest
calf
in
the
bunch
the
calf
he
had
on
his
rope
was
a
beauty
and
on
overtaking
him
i
reined
in
my
horse
for
to
have
killed
a
second
one
would
have
been
sheer
waste
priest
wanted
me
to
shoot
the
calf
but
i
refused
so
he
shifted
the
rope
to
the
pommel
of
my
saddle
and
dismounting
dropped
the
calf
at
the
first
shot
we
skinned
him
cut
off
his
head
and
after
disemboweling
him
lashed
the
carcass
across
my
saddle
then
both
of
us
mounted
priest
horse
and
started
on
our
return
on
reaching
the
horse
stock
we
succeeded
in
catching
a
sleepy
old
horse
belonging
to
rod
wheat
mount
and
i
rode
him
bridleless
and
bareback
to
camp
we
received
an
ovation
on
our
arrival
the
recovery
of
the
saddle
horses
being
a
secondary
matter
compared
to
the
buffalo
veal
so
it
was
buffalo
that
scared
our
horses
was
it
and
ran
them
out
of
camp
said
mccann
as
he
helped
to
unlash
the
calf
well
it
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
there
was
no
particular
loss
of
time
for
the
herd
had
grazed
away
on
our
course
several
miles
and
after
changing
our
mounts
we
overtook
the
herd
with
the
news
that
not
only
the
horses
had
been
found
but
that
there
was
fresh
meat
in
camp
and
buffalo
veal
at
that
the
other
men
out
horse
hunting
seeing
the
cattle
strung
out
in
traveling
shape
soon
returned
to
their
places
beside
the
trailing
herd
we
held
a
due
northward
course
which
we
figured
ought
to
carry
us
past
and
at
least
thirty
miles
to
the
westward
of
the
big
indian
encampment
the
worst
thing
with
which
we
had
now
to
contend
was
the
weather
it
having
rained
more
or
less
during
the
past
day
and
night
or
ever
since
we
had
crossed
the
salt
fork
the
weather
had
thrown
the
outfit
into
such
a
gloomy
mood
that
they
would
scarcely
speak
to
or
answer
each
other
this
gloomy
feeling
had
been
growing
on
us
for
several
days
and
it
was
even
believed
secretly
that
our
foreman
did
know
where
he
was
that
the
outfit
was
drifting
and
as
good
as
lost
about
noon
of
the
third
day
the
weather
continuing
wet
with
cold
nights
and
with
no
abatement
of
the
general
gloom
our
men
on
point
noticed
smoke
arising
directly
ahead
on
our
course
in
a
little
valley
through
which
ran
a
nice
stream
of
water
when
attention
was
directed
to
the
smoke
he
rode
forward
to
ascertain
the
cause
and
returned
worse
baffled
than
i
ever
saw
him
it
was
an
indian
camp
and
had
evidently
been
abandoned
only
that
morning
for
the
fires
were
still
smouldering
ordering
the
wagon
to
camp
on
the
creek
and
the
cattle
to
graze
forward
till
noon
flood
returned
to
the
indian
camp
taking
two
of
the
boys
and
myself
with
him
it
had
not
been
a
permanent
camp
yet
showed
evidence
of
having
been
occupied
several
days
at
least
and
had
contained
nearly
a
hundred
wickyups
and
tepees
altogether
too
large
an
encampment
to
suit
our
tastes
the
foreman
had
us
hunt
up
the
trail
leaving
and
once
we
had
found
it
all
four
of
us
ran
it
out
five
or
six
miles
when
from
the
freshness
of
it
fearing
that
we
might
be
seen
we
turned
back
the
indians
had
many
ponies
and
possibly
some
cattle
though
the
sign
of
the
latter
was
hard
to
distinguish
from
buffalo
before
quitting
their
trail
we
concluded
they
were
from
one
of
the
reservations
and
were
heading
for
their
old
stamping
ground
the
country
peaceable
probably
but
whether
peaceable
or
not
we
had
no
desire
to
meet
with
them
we
lost
little
time
then
in
returning
to
the
herd
and
making
late
and
early
drives
until
we
were
out
of
that
section
but
one
can
not
foresee
impending
trouble
on
the
cattle
trail
any
more
than
elsewhere
and
although
we
encamped
that
night
a
long
distance
to
the
north
of
the
abandoned
indian
camp
the
next
morning
we
came
near
having
a
stampede
it
happened
just
at
dawn
flood
had
called
the
cook
an
hour
before
daybreak
and
he
had
started
out
with
honeyman
to
drive
in
the
which
had
scattered
badly
the
morning
before
they
had
the
horses
rounded
up
and
were
driving
them
towards
camp
when
about
half
a
mile
from
the
wagon
four
old
buffalo
bulls
ran
quartering
past
the
horses
this
was
tinder
among
stubble
and
in
their
panic
the
horses
outstripped
the
wranglers
and
came
thundering
for
camp
luckily
we
had
been
called
to
breakfast
and
those
of
us
who
could
see
what
was
up
ran
and
secured
our
night
horses
before
half
of
the
horses
were
thus
secured
however
one
hundred
and
thirty
loose
saddle
stock
dashed
through
camp
and
every
horse
on
picket
went
with
them
saddles
and
all
and
dragging
the
picket
ropes
then
the
cattle
jumped
from
the
bed
ground
and
were
off
like
a
shot
the
fourth
guard
who
had
them
in
charge
with
them
just
for
the
time
being
it
was
an
open
question
which
way
to
ride
our
saddle
horses
going
in
one
direction
and
the
herd
in
another
priest
was
an
early
riser
and
had
hustled
me
out
early
so
fortunately
we
reached
our
horses
though
over
half
the
outfit
in
camp
could
only
look
on
and
curse
their
luck
at
being
left
afoot
the
rebel
was
first
in
the
saddle
and
turned
after
the
horses
but
i
rode
for
the
herd
the
cattle
were
not
badly
scared
and
as
the
morning
grew
clearer
five
of
us
quieted
them
down
before
they
had
run
more
than
a
short
mile
the
horses
however
gave
us
a
long
hard
run
and
since
a
horse
has
a
splendid
memory
the
effects
of
this
scare
were
noticeable
for
nearly
a
month
after
honeyman
at
once
urged
our
foreman
to
hobble
at
night
but
flood
knew
the
importance
of
keeping
the
strong
and
refused
but
his
decision
was
forced
for
just
as
it
was
growing
dusk
that
evening
we
heard
the
horses
running
and
all
hands
had
to
turn
out
to
surround
them
and
bring
them
into
camp
we
hobbled
every
horse
and
certain
leaders
and
for
fully
a
week
following
one
scare
or
another
seemed
to
hold
our
saddle
stock
in
constant
terror
during
this
week
we
turned
out
our
night
horses
and
taking
the
worst
of
the
leaders
in
their
stead
tied
them
solidly
to
the
wagon
wheels
all
night
not
being
willing
to
trust
to
picket
ropes
they
would
even
run
from
a
mounted
man
during
the
twilight
of
evening
or
early
dawn
or
from
any
object
not
distinguishable
in
uncertain
light
but
the
wrangler
now
never
went
near
them
until
after
sunrise
and
their
nervousness
gradually
subsided
trouble
never
comes
singly
however
and
when
we
struck
the
salt
fork
we
found
it
raging
and
impassable
nearly
from
bank
to
bank
but
get
across
we
must
the
swimming
of
it
was
nothing
but
it
was
necessary
to
get
our
wagon
over
and
there
came
the
rub
we
swam
the
cattle
in
twenty
minutes
time
but
it
took
us
a
full
half
day
to
get
the
wagon
over
the
river
was
at
least
a
hundred
yards
wide
three
quarters
of
which
was
swimming
to
a
horse
but
we
hunted
up
and
down
the
river
until
we
found
an
eddy
where
the
banks
had
a
gradual
approach
to
deep
water
and
started
to
raft
the
wagon
over
a
thing
none
of
the
outfit
had
ever
seen
done
though
we
had
often
heard
of
it
around
in
texas
the
first
thing
was
to
get
the
necessary
timber
to
make
the
raft
we
scouted
along
the
salt
fork
for
a
mile
either
way
before
we
found
sufficient
dry
dead
cottonwood
to
form
our
raft
then
we
set
about
cutting
it
but
we
had
only
one
axe
and
were
the
poorest
set
of
axemen
that
were
ever
called
upon
to
perform
a
similar
task
when
we
cut
a
tree
it
looked
as
though
a
beaver
had
gnawed
it
down
on
horseback
the
texan
shines
at
the
head
of
his
class
but
in
any
occupation
which
must
be
performed
on
foot
he
is
never
a
competitor
there
was
scarcely
a
man
in
our
outfit
who
could
not
swing
a
rope
and
tie
down
a
steer
in
a
given
space
of
time
but
when
it
came
to
swinging
an
axe
to
cut
logs
for
the
raft
our
lustre
faded
cutting
these
logs
said
joe
stallings
as
he
mopped
the
sweat
from
his
brow
reminds
me
of
what
the
tennessee
girl
who
married
a
texan
wrote
home
to
her
sister
so
she
wrote
a
good
place
for
men
and
dogs
but
it
hell
on
women
and
oxen
dragging
the
logs
up
to
the
place
selected
for
the
ford
was
an
easy
matter
they
were
light
and
we
did
it
with
ropes
from
the
pommels
of
our
saddles
two
to
four
horses
being
sufficient
to
handle
any
of
the
trees
when
everything
was
ready
we
ran
the
wagon
out
into
water
and
built
the
raft
under
it
we
had
cut
the
dry
logs
from
eighteen
to
twenty
feet
long
and
now
ran
a
tier
of
these
under
the
wagon
between
the
wheels
these
we
lashed
securely
to
the
axle
and
even
lashed
one
large
log
on
the
underside
of
the
hub
on
the
outside
of
the
wheel
then
we
under
these
lashing
everything
securely
to
this
outside
guard
log
before
we
had
finished
the
it
was
necessary
to
take
an
anchor
rope
ashore
for
fear
our
wagon
would
float
away
by
the
time
we
had
succeeded
in
getting
dry
cottonwood
logs
under
our
wagon
it
was
afloat
half
a
dozen
of
us
then
swam
the
river
on
our
horses
taking
across
the
heaviest
rope
we
had
for
a
tow
line
we
threw
the
wagon
tongue
back
and
lashed
it
and
making
fast
to
the
wagon
with
one
end
of
the
tow
rope
fastened
our
lariats
to
the
other
with
the
remainder
of
our
unused
rope
we
took
a
guy
line
from
the
wagon
and
snubbed
it
to
a
tree
on
the
south
bank
everything
being
in
readiness
the
word
was
given
and
as
those
on
the
south
bank
eased
away
those
on
horseback
on
the
other
side
gave
the
rowel
to
their
horses
and
our
commissary
floated
across
the
wagon
floated
so
easily
that
mccann
was
ordered
on
to
the
raft
to
trim
the
weight
when
it
struck
the
current
the
current
carried
it
slightly
downstream
and
when
it
lodged
on
the
other
side
those
on
the
south
bank
fastened
lariats
to
the
guy
rope
and
with
them
pulling
from
that
side
and
us
from
ours
it
was
soon
brought
opposite
the
landing
and
hauled
into
shallow
water
once
the
raft
timber
was
unlashed
and
removed
the
tongue
was
lowered
and
from
the
pommels
of
six
saddles
the
wagon
was
set
high
and
dry
on
the
north
bank
there
now
only
remained
to
bring
up
the
cattle
and
swim
them
which
was
an
easy
task
and
soon
accomplished
after
putting
the
salt
fork
behind
us
our
spirits
were
again
dampened
for
it
rained
all
the
latter
part
of
the
night
and
until
noon
the
next
day
it
was
with
considerable
difficulty
that
mccann
could
keep
his
fire
from
drowning
out
while
he
was
getting
breakfast
and
several
of
the
outfit
refused
to
eat
at
all
flood
knew
it
was
useless
to
rally
the
boys
for
a
wet
hungry
man
is
not
to
be
jollied
or
reasoned
with
five
days
had
now
elapsed
since
we
turned
off
the
established
trail
and
half
the
time
rain
had
been
falling
besides
our
doubt
as
to
where
we
were
had
been
growing
so
before
we
started
that
morning
bull
durham
very
asked
flood
if
he
had
any
idea
where
he
was
no
i
have
no
more
than
you
have
replied
our
foreman
but
this
much
i
do
know
or
will
just
as
soon
as
the
sun
comes
out
i
know
north
from
south
we
have
been
traveling
north
by
a
little
west
and
if
we
hold
that
course
we
bound
to
strike
the
north
fork
and
within
a
day
or
two
afterwards
we
will
come
into
the
government
trail
running
from
fort
elliot
to
camp
supply
which
will
lead
us
into
our
own
trail
or
if
we
were
certain
that
we
had
cleared
the
indian
reservation
we
could
bear
to
our
right
and
in
time
we
would
reënter
the
trail
that
way
i
ca
help
the
weather
boys
and
as
long
as
i
have
chuck
i
as
lief
be
lost
as
found
if
there
was
any
recovery
in
the
feelings
of
the
outfit
after
this
talk
of
flood
it
was
not
noticeable
and
it
is
safe
to
say
that
two
thirds
of
the
boys
believed
we
were
in
the
of
texas
one
man
opinion
is
as
good
as
another
in
a
strange
country
and
while
there
was
a
man
in
the
outfit
who
cared
to
suggest
it
i
know
the
majority
of
us
would
have
indorsed
turning
northeast
but
the
fates
smiled
on
us
at
last
about
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
on
the
following
day
we
cut
an
indian
trail
about
three
days
old
of
probably
fifty
horses
a
number
of
us
followed
the
trail
several
miles
on
its
westward
course
and
among
other
things
discovered
that
they
had
been
driving
a
small
bunch
of
cattle
evidently
making
for
the
sand
hills
which
we
could
see
about
twenty
miles
to
our
left
how
they
had
come
by
the
cattle
was
a
mystery
perhaps
by
forced
levy
perhaps
from
a
stampede
one
thing
was
certain
the
trail
must
have
contributed
them
for
there
were
none
but
trail
cattle
in
the
country
this
was
reassuring
and
gave
some
hint
of
guidance
we
were
all
tickled
therefore
after
nooning
that
day
and
on
starting
the
herd
in
the
afternoon
to
hear
our
foreman
give
orders
to
point
the
herd
a
little
east
of
north
the
next
few
days
we
made
long
drives
our
saddle
horses
recovered
from
their
scare
and
the
outfit
fast
regained
its
spirits
on
the
morning
of
the
tenth
day
after
leaving
the
trail
we
loitered
up
a
long
slope
to
a
divide
in
our
lead
from
which
we
sighted
timber
to
the
north
this
we
supposed
from
its
size
must
be
the
north
fork
our
route
lay
up
this
divide
some
distance
and
before
we
left
it
some
one
in
the
rear
sighted
a
dust
cloud
to
the
right
and
far
behind
us
as
dust
would
hardly
rise
on
a
still
morning
without
a
cause
we
turned
the
herd
off
the
divide
and
pushed
on
for
we
suspected
indians
flood
and
priest
hung
back
on
the
divide
watching
the
dust
signals
and
after
the
herd
had
left
them
several
miles
in
the
rear
they
turned
and
rode
towards
it
a
move
which
the
outfit
could
hardly
make
out
it
was
nearly
noon
when
we
saw
them
returning
in
a
long
lope
and
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
herd
priest
waved
his
hat
in
the
air
and
gave
the
long
yell
when
he
explained
that
there
was
a
herd
of
cattle
on
the
trail
in
the
rear
and
to
our
right
the
yell
went
around
the
herd
and
was
reechoed
by
our
wrangler
and
cook
in
the
rear
the
spirits
of
the
outfit
instantly
rose
we
halted
the
herd
and
camped
for
noon
and
mccann
set
out
his
best
in
celebrating
the
occasion
it
was
the
most
enjoyable
meal
we
had
had
in
the
past
ten
days
after
a
good
noonday
rest
we
set
out
and
having
entered
the
trail
during
the
afternoon
crossed
the
north
fork
late
that
evening
as
we
were
going
into
camp
we
noticed
a
horseman
coming
up
the
trail
who
turned
out
to
be
smiling
nat
straw
whom
we
had
left
on
the
colorado
river
well
girls
said
nat
dismounting
i
did
know
who
you
were
but
i
just
thought
i
ride
ahead
and
overtake
whoever
it
was
and
stay
all
night
indians
yes
i
would
drive
on
a
trail
that
had
any
excitement
on
it
i
gave
the
last
big
encampment
ten
strays
and
won
them
all
back
and
four
ponies
besides
on
a
horse
race
oh
yes
got
some
running
stock
with
us
how
soon
will
supper
be
ready
cusi
get
up
something
extra
for
you
got
company
chapter
xi
a
boggy
ford
that
night
we
learned
from
straw
our
location
on
the
trail
we
were
far
above
the
indian
reservation
and
instead
of
having
been
astray
our
foreman
had
held
a
due
northward
course
and
we
were
probably
as
far
on
the
trail
as
if
we
had
followed
the
regular
route
so
in
spite
of
all
our
good
maxims
we
had
been
borrowing
trouble
we
were
never
over
thirty
miles
to
the
westward
of
what
was
then
the
new
western
cattle
trail
we
concluded
that
the
running
w
herd
had
turned
back
as
straw
brought
the
report
that
some
herd
had
recrossed
red
river
the
day
before
his
arrival
giving
for
reasons
the
wet
season
and
the
danger
of
getting
waterbound
about
noon
of
the
second
day
after
leaving
the
north
fork
of
red
river
we
crossed
the
washita
a
deep
stream
the
slippery
banks
of
which
gave
every
indication
of
a
recent
rise
we
had
no
trouble
in
crossing
either
wagon
or
herd
it
being
hardly
a
check
in
our
onward
course
the
abandonment
of
the
regular
trail
the
past
ten
days
had
been
a
noticeable
benefit
to
our
herd
for
the
cattle
had
had
an
abundance
of
fresh
country
to
graze
over
as
well
as
plenty
of
rest
but
now
that
we
were
back
on
the
trail
we
gave
them
their
freedom
and
frequently
covered
twenty
miles
a
day
until
we
reached
the
south
canadian
which
proved
to
be
the
most
delusive
stream
we
had
yet
encountered
it
also
showed
like
the
washita
every
evidence
of
having
been
on
a
recent
rampage
on
our
arrival
there
was
no
volume
of
water
to
interfere
but
it
had
a
quicksand
bottom
that
would
bog
a
saddle
blanket
our
foreman
had
been
on
ahead
and
examined
the
regular
crossing
and
when
he
returned
freely
expressed
his
opinion
that
we
would
be
unable
to
trail
the
herd
across
but
might
hope
to
effect
it
by
cutting
it
into
small
bunches
when
we
came
therefore
within
three
miles
of
the
river
we
turned
off
the
trail
to
a
creek
and
thoroughly
watered
the
herd
this
was
contrary
to
our
practice
for
we
usually
wanted
the
herd
thirsty
when
reaching
a
large
river
but
any
cow
brute
that
halted
in
fording
the
canadian
that
day
was
doomed
to
sink
into
quicksands
from
which
escape
was
doubtful
we
held
the
wagon
and
saddle
horses
in
the
rear
and
when
we
were
half
a
mile
away
from
the
trail
ford
cut
off
about
two
hundred
head
of
the
leaders
and
started
for
the
crossing
leaving
only
the
horse
wrangler
and
one
man
with
the
herd
on
reaching
the
river
we
gave
them
an
extra
push
and
the
cattle
plunged
into
the
muddy
water
before
the
cattle
had
advanced
fifty
feet
instinct
earned
them
of
the
treacherous
footing
and
the
leaders
tried
to
turn
back
but
by
that
time
we
had
the
entire
bunch
in
the
water
and
were
urging
them
forward
they
had
halted
but
a
moment
and
begun
milling
when
several
heavy
steers
sank
then
we
gave
way
and
allowed
the
rest
to
come
back
we
did
not
realize
fully
the
treachery
of
this
river
until
we
saw
that
twenty
cattle
were
caught
in
the
merciless
grasp
of
the
quicksand
they
sank
slowly
to
the
level
of
their
bodies
which
gave
sufficient
resistance
to
support
their
weight
but
they
were
hopelessly
bogged
we
allowed
the
free
cattle
to
return
to
the
herd
and
immediately
turned
our
attention
to
those
that
were
bogged
some
of
whom
were
nearly
submerged
by
water
we
dispatched
some
of
the
boys
to
the
wagon
for
our
heavy
corral
ropes
and
a
bundle
of
and
the
remainder
of
us
stripped
to
the
belt
waded
out
and
surveyed
the
situation
at
close
quarters
we
were
all
experienced
in
handling
bogged
cattle
though
this
quicksand
was
the
most
deceptive
that
i
at
least
had
ever
witnessed
the
bottom
of
the
river
as
we
waded
through
it
was
solid
under
our
feet
and
as
long
as
we
kept
moving
it
felt
so
but
the
moment
we
stopped
we
sank
as
in
a
quagmire
the
pull
of
this
quicksand
was
so
strong
that
four
of
us
were
unable
to
lift
a
steer
tail
out
once
it
was
imbedded
in
the
sand
and
when
we
had
released
a
tail
by
burrowing
around
it
to
arm
length
and
freed
it
it
would
sink
of
its
own
weight
in
a
minute
time
until
it
would
have
to
be
burrowed
out
again
to
avoid
this
we
had
to
coil
up
the
tails
and
tie
them
with
a
soft
rope
hobble
fortunately
none
of
the
cattle
were
over
forty
feet
from
the
bank
and
when
our
heavy
rope
arrived
we
divided
into
two
gangs
and
began
the
work
of
rescue
we
first
took
a
heavy
rope
from
the
animal
horns
to
solid
footing
on
the
river
bank
and
tied
to
this
five
or
six
of
our
lariats
meanwhile
others
rolled
a
steer
over
as
far
as
possible
and
began
burrowing
with
their
hands
down
alongside
a
fore
and
hind
leg
simultaneously
until
they
could
pass
a
small
rope
around
the
pastern
above
the
cloof
or
better
yet
through
the
cloven
in
the
hoof
when
the
leg
could
be
readily
lifted
by
two
men
we
could
not
stop
burrowing
however
for
a
moment
or
the
space
would
fill
and
solidify
once
a
leg
was
freed
we
doubled
it
back
short
and
securely
tied
it
with
a
hobble
and
when
the
fore
and
hind
leg
were
thus
secured
we
turned
the
animal
over
on
that
side
and
released
the
other
legs
in
a
similar
manner
then
we
hastened
out
of
the
water
and
into
our
saddles
and
wrapped
the
loose
end
of
our
ropes
to
the
pommels
having
already
tied
the
lariats
to
the
heavy
corral
rope
from
the
animal
horns
when
the
word
was
given
we
took
a
good
swinging
start
and
unless
something
gave
way
there
was
one
steer
less
in
the
hog
after
we
had
landed
the
animal
high
and
dry
on
the
bank
it
was
but
a
minute
work
to
free
the
rope
and
untie
the
hobbles
then
it
was
advisable
to
get
into
the
saddle
with
little
loss
of
time
and
give
him
a
wide
berth
for
he
generally
arose
angry
and
sullen
it
was
dark
before
we
got
the
last
of
the
bogged
cattle
out
and
retraced
our
way
to
camp
from
the
first
river
on
the
trip
that
had
turned
us
but
we
were
not
the
least
discouraged
for
we
felt
certain
there
was
a
ford
that
had
a
bottom
somewhere
within
a
few
miles
and
we
could
hunt
it
up
on
the
morrow
the
next
one
however
we
would
try
before
we
put
the
cattle
in
there
was
no
question
that
the
treacherous
condition
of
the
river
was
due
to
the
recent
freshet
which
had
brought
down
new
deposits
of
sediment
and
had
agitated
the
old
even
to
changing
the
channel
of
the
river
so
that
it
had
not
as
yet
had
sufficient
time
to
settle
and
solidify
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
flood
and
two
or
three
of
the
boys
set
out
up
the
river
while
an
equal
number
of
us
started
under
the
leadership
of
the
rebel
down
the
river
on
a
similar
errand
to
prospect
for
a
crossing
our
party
scouted
for
about
five
miles
and
the
only
safe
footing
we
could
find
was
a
swift
narrow
channel
between
the
bank
and
an
island
in
the
river
while
beyond
the
island
was
a
much
wider
channel
with
water
deep
enough
in
several
places
to
swim
our
saddle
horses
the
footing
seemed
quite
secure
to
our
horses
but
the
cattle
were
much
heavier
and
if
an
animal
ever
bogged
in
the
river
there
was
water
enough
to
drown
him
before
help
could
be
rendered
we
stopped
our
horses
a
number
of
times
however
to
try
the
footing
and
in
none
of
our
experiments
was
there
any
indication
of
quicksand
so
we
counted
the
crossing
safe
on
our
return
we
found
the
herd
already
in
motion
headed
up
the
river
where
our
foreman
had
located
a
crossing
as
it
was
then
useless
to
make
any
mention
of
the
island
crossing
which
we
had
located
at
least
until
a
trial
had
been
given
to
the
upper
ford
we
said
nothing
when
we
came
within
half
a
mile
of
the
new
ford
we
held
up
the
herd
and
allowed
them
to
graze
and
brought
up
the
and
crossed
and
recrossed
them
without
bogging
a
single
horse
encouraged
at
this
we
cut
off
about
a
hundred
head
of
heavy
lead
cattle
and
started
for
the
ford
we
had
a
good
push
on
them
when
we
struck
the
water
for
there
were
ten
riders
around
them
and
flood
was
in
the
lead
we
called
to
him
several
times
that
the
cattle
were
bogging
but
he
never
halted
until
he
pulled
out
on
the
opposite
bank
leaving
twelve
of
the
heaviest
steers
in
the
quicksand
well
in
all
my
experience
in
trail
work
said
flood
as
he
gazed
back
at
the
dozen
animals
struggling
in
the
quicksand
i
never
saw
as
deceptive
a
bottom
in
any
river
we
used
to
fear
the
cimarron
and
platte
but
the
old
south
canadian
is
the
girl
that
can
lay
it
over
them
both
still
there
ai
any
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
and
we
have
got
men
enough
to
hold
two
herds
so
surround
them
boys
and
we
recross
them
if
we
leave
more
in
the
river
take
them
back
a
good
quarter
fellows
and
bring
them
up
on
a
run
and
i
take
the
lead
when
they
strike
the
water
and
give
them
no
show
to
halt
until
they
get
across
as
the
little
bunch
of
cattle
had
already
grazed
out
nearly
a
quarter
we
rounded
them
into
a
compact
body
and
started
for
the
river
to
recross
them
the
nearer
we
came
to
the
river
the
faster
we
went
till
we
struck
the
water
in
several
places
where
there
were
channels
we
could
neither
force
the
cattle
nor
ride
ourselves
faster
than
a
walk
on
account
of
the
depth
of
the
water
but
when
we
struck
the
shallows
which
were
the
really
dangerous
places
we
forced
the
cattle
with
horse
and
quirt
near
the
middle
of
the
river
in
shoal
water
rod
wheat
was
quirting
up
the
cattle
when
a
big
dun
steer
trying
to
get
out
of
his
reach
sank
in
the
quicksand
and
rod
horse
stumbled
across
the
animal
and
was
thrown
he
floundered
in
attempting
to
rise
and
his
hind
feet
sank
to
the
haunches
his
ineffectual
struggles
caused
him
to
sink
farther
to
the
flanks
in
the
loblolly
which
the
tramping
of
the
cattle
had
caused
and
there
horse
and
steer
lay
side
by
side
like
two
in
a
bed
wheat
loosened
the
cinches
of
the
saddle
on
either
side
and
stripping
the
bridle
off
brought
up
the
rear
carrying
saddle
bridle
and
blankets
on
his
back
the
river
was
at
least
three
hundred
yards
wide
and
when
we
got
to
the
farther
bank
our
horses
were
so
exhausted
that
we
dismounted
and
let
them
blow
a
survey
showed
we
had
left
a
total
of
fifteen
cattle
and
the
horse
in
the
quicksands
but
we
congratulated
ourselves
that
we
had
bogged
down
only
three
head
in
recrossing
getting
these
cattle
out
was
a
much
harder
task
than
the
twenty
head
gave
us
the
day
before
for
many
of
these
were
bogged
more
than
a
hundred
yards
from
the
bank
but
no
time
was
to
be
lost
the
wagon
was
brought
up
in
a
hurry
fresh
horses
were
caught
and
we
stripped
for
the
fray
while
mccann
got
dinner
we
got
out
the
horse
even
saving
the
cinches
that
were
abandoned
in
freeing
him
of
the
saddle
during
the
afternoon
we
were
compelled
to
adopt
a
new
mode
of
procedure
for
with
the
limited
amount
of
rope
at
hand
we
could
only
use
one
rope
for
drawing
the
cattle
out
to
solid
footing
after
they
were
freed
from
the
quagmire
but
we
had
four
good
mules
to
our
chuck
wagon
and
instead
of
dragging
the
cattle
ashore
from
the
pommels
of
saddles
we
tied
one
end
of
the
rope
to
the
hind
axle
and
used
the
mules
in
snaking
the
cattle
out
this
worked
splendidly
but
every
time
we
freed
a
steer
we
had
to
drive
the
wagon
well
out
of
reach
for
fear
he
might
charge
the
wagon
and
team
but
with
three
crews
working
in
the
water
tying
up
tails
and
legs
the
work
progressed
more
rapidly
than
it
had
done
the
day
before
and
two
hours
before
sunset
the
last
animal
had
been
freed
we
had
several
exciting
incidents
during
the
operation
for
several
steers
showed
fight
and
when
released
went
on
the
prod
for
the
first
thing
in
sight
the
herd
was
grazing
nearly
a
mile
away
during
the
afternoon
and
as
fast
as
a
steer
was
pulled
out
some
one
would
take
a
horse
and
give
the
freed
animal
a
start
for
the
herd
one
big
black
steer
turned
on
flood
who
generally
attended
to
this
and
gave
him
a
spirited
chase
in
getting
out
of
the
angry
steer
way
he
passed
near
the
wagon
when
the
maddened
beef
turned
from
flood
and
charged
the
commissary
mccann
was
riding
the
nigh
wheel
mule
and
when
he
saw
the
steer
coming
he
poured
the
whip
into
the
mules
and
circled
around
like
a
battery
in
field
practice
trying
to
get
out
of
the
way
flood
made
several
attempts
to
cut
off
the
steer
from
the
wagon
but
he
followed
it
like
a
mover
dog
until
a
number
of
us
fearing
our
mules
would
be
gored
ran
out
of
the
water
mounted
our
horses
and
joined
in
the
chase
when
we
came
up
with
the
circus
our
foreman
called
to
us
to
rope
the
beef
and
fox
quarternight
getting
in
the
first
cast
caught
him
by
the
two
front
feet
and
threw
him
heavily
before
he
could
rise
several
of
us
had
dismounted
and
were
sitting
on
him
like
buzzards
on
carrion
mccann
then
drove
the
team
around
behind
a
sand
dune
out
of
sight
we
released
the
beef
and
he
was
glad
to
return
to
the
herd
quite
sobered
by
the
throwing
another
incident
occurred
near
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
from
some
cause
or
other
the
hind
leg
of
a
steer
after
having
been
tied
up
became
loosened
no
one
noticed
this
but
when
after
several
successive
trials
during
which
barney
mccann
exhausted
a
large
vocabulary
of
profanity
the
mule
team
was
unable
to
move
the
steer
six
of
us
fastened
our
lariats
to
the
main
rope
and
dragged
the
beef
ashore
with
great
but
when
one
of
the
boys
dismounted
to
unloose
the
hobbles
and
rope
a
sight
met
our
eyes
that
sent
a
sickening
sensation
through
us
for
the
steer
had
left
one
hind
leg
in
the
river
neatly
disjointed
at
the
knee
then
we
knew
why
the
mules
had
failed
to
move
him
having
previously
supposed
his
size
was
the
difficulty
for
he
was
one
of
the
largest
steers
in
the
herd
no
doubt
the
steer
leg
had
been
unjointed
in
swinging
him
around
but
it
had
taken
six
extra
horses
to
sever
the
ligaments
and
skin
while
the
merciless
quicksands
of
the
canadian
held
the
limb
a
friendly
shot
ended
the
steer
sufferings
and
before
we
finished
our
work
for
the
day
a
flight
of
buzzards
were
circling
around
in
anticipation
of
the
coming
feast
another
day
had
been
lost
and
still
the
south
canadian
defied
us
we
drifted
the
cattle
back
to
the
previous
night
camp
using
the
same
bed
ground
for
our
herd
it
was
then
that
the
rebel
broached
the
subject
of
a
crossing
at
the
island
which
we
had
examined
that
morning
and
offered
to
show
it
to
our
foreman
by
daybreak
we
put
two
extra
horses
on
picket
that
night
and
the
next
morning
before
the
sun
was
half
an
hour
high
the
foreman
and
the
rebel
had
returned
from
the
island
down
the
river
with
word
that
we
were
to
give
the
ford
a
trial
though
we
could
not
cross
the
wagon
there
accordingly
we
grazed
the
herd
down
the
river
and
came
opposite
the
island
near
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
as
usual
we
cut
off
about
one
hundred
of
the
lead
cattle
the
leaders
naturally
being
the
heaviest
and
started
them
into
the
water
we
reached
the
island
and
scaled
the
farther
bank
without
a
single
animal
losing
his
footing
we
brought
up
a
second
bunch
of
double
and
a
third
of
triple
the
number
of
the
first
and
crossed
them
with
safety
but
as
yet
the
canadian
was
dallying
with
us
as
we
crossed
each
successive
bunch
the
tramping
of
the
cattle
increasingly
agitated
the
sands
and
when
we
had
the
herd
about
half
over
we
bogged
our
first
steer
on
the
farther
landing
as
the
water
was
so
shallow
that
drowning
was
out
of
the
question
we
went
back
and
trailed
in
the
remainder
of
the
herd
knowing
the
bogged
steer
would
be
there
when
we
were
ready
for
him
the
island
was
about
two
hundred
yards
long
by
twenty
wide
lying
up
and
down
the
river
and
in
leaving
it
for
the
farther
bank
we
always
pushed
off
at
the
upper
end
but
now
in
trailing
the
remainder
of
the
cattle
over
we
attempted
to
force
them
into
the
water
at
the
lower
end
as
the
footing
at
that
point
of
this
middle
ground
had
not
as
yet
been
trampled
up
as
had
the
upper
end
everything
worked
nicely
until
the
rear
guard
of
the
last
five
or
six
hundred
congested
on
the
island
the
outfit
being
scattered
on
both
sides
of
the
river
as
well
as
in
the
middle
leaving
a
scarcity
of
men
at
all
points
when
the
final
rear
guard
had
reached
the
river
the
cattle
were
striking
out
for
the
farther
shore
from
every
quarter
of
the
island
at
their
own
sweet
will
stopping
to
drink
and
loitering
on
the
farther
side
for
there
was
no
one
to
hustle
them
out
all
were
over
at
last
and
we
were
on
the
point
of
congratulating
ourselves
for
although
the
herd
had
scattered
badly
we
had
less
than
a
dozen
bogged
cattle
and
those
near
the
shore
when
suddenly
up
the
river
over
a
mile
there
began
a
rapid
shooting
satisfied
that
it
was
by
our
own
men
we
separated
and
circling
right
and
left
began
to
throw
the
herd
together
some
of
us
rode
up
the
river
bank
and
soon
located
the
trouble
we
had
not
ridden
a
quarter
of
a
mile
before
we
passed
a
number
of
our
herd
bogged
these
having
reëntered
the
river
for
their
noonday
drink
and
on
coming
up
with
the
men
who
had
done
the
shooting
we
found
them
throwing
the
herd
out
from
the
water
they
reported
that
a
large
number
of
cattle
were
bogged
farther
up
the
river
all
hands
rounded
in
the
herd
and
drifting
them
out
nearly
a
mile
from
the
river
left
them
under
two
herders
when
the
remainder
of
us
returned
to
the
bogged
cattle
there
were
by
actual
count
including
those
down
at
the
crossing
over
eighty
bogged
cattle
that
required
our
attention
extending
over
a
space
of
a
mile
or
more
above
the
island
ford
the
outlook
was
anything
but
pleasing
flood
was
almost
speechless
over
the
situation
for
it
might
have
been
guarded
against
but
realizing
the
task
before
us
we
recrossed
the
river
for
dinner
well
knowing
the
inner
man
needed
fortifying
for
the
work
before
us
no
sooner
had
we
disposed
of
the
meal
and
secured
a
change
of
mounts
all
round
than
we
sent
two
men
to
relieve
the
men
on
herd
when
they
were
off
flood
divided
up
our
forces
for
the
afternoon
work
it
will
never
do
said
he
to
get
separated
from
our
commissary
so
priest
you
take
the
wagon
and
and
go
back
up
to
the
regular
crossing
and
get
our
wagon
over
somehow
there
will
be
the
cook
and
wrangler
besides
yourself
and
you
may
have
two
other
men
you
will
have
to
lighten
your
load
and
do
attempt
to
cross
those
mules
hitched
to
the
wagon
rely
on
your
saddle
horses
for
getting
the
wagon
over
forrest
you
and
bull
with
the
two
men
on
herd
take
the
cattle
to
the
nearest
creek
and
water
them
well
after
watering
drift
them
back
so
they
will
be
within
a
mile
of
these
bogged
cattle
then
leave
two
men
with
them
and
return
to
the
river
i
take
the
remainder
of
the
outfit
and
begin
at
the
ford
and
work
up
the
river
get
the
ropes
and
hobbles
boys
and
come
on
john
officer
and
i
were
left
with
the
rebel
to
get
the
wagon
across
and
while
waiting
for
the
men
on
herd
to
get
in
we
hooked
up
the
mules
honeyman
had
the
in
hand
to
start
the
minute
our
herders
returned
their
change
of
mounts
being
already
tied
to
the
wagon
wheels
the
need
of
haste
was
very
imperative
for
the
river
might
rise
without
an
hour
notice
and
a
rise
would
drown
every
hoof
in
the
river
as
well
as
cut
us
off
from
our
wagon
the
south
canadian
has
its
source
in
the
staked
plains
and
the
mountains
of
new
mexico
and
freshets
there
would
cause
a
rise
here
local
conditions
never
affecting
a
river
of
such
width
several
of
us
had
seen
these
plains
rivers
when
the
mountain
was
sportive
and
dallying
with
the
plain
under
a
clear
sky
and
without
any
warning
of
falling
weather
rise
with
a
rush
of
water
like
a
tidal
wave
or
the
stream
from
a
broken
dam
so
when
our
men
from
herd
galloped
in
we
stripped
their
saddles
from
tired
horses
and
cinched
them
to
fresh
ones
while
they
that
there
might
be
no
loss
of
time
bolted
their
dinners
it
took
us
less
than
an
hour
to
reach
the
ford
where
we
unloaded
the
wagon
of
everything
but
the
which
was
ironed
fast
we
had
an
extra
saddle
in
the
wagon
and
mccann
was
mounted
on
a
good
horse
for
he
could
ride
as
well
as
cook
priest
and
i
rode
the
river
selecting
a
route
and
on
our
return
all
five
of
us
tied
our
lariats
to
the
tongue
and
sides
of
the
wagon
we
took
a
running
start
and
until
we
struck
the
farther
bank
we
gave
the
wagon
no
time
to
sink
but
pulled
it
out
of
the
river
with
a
shout
our
horses
flanks
heaving
then
recrossing
the
river
we
lashed
all
the
bedding
to
four
gentle
saddle
horses
and
led
them
over
but
to
get
our
provisions
across
was
no
easy
matter
for
we
were
heavily
loaded
having
taken
on
a
supply
at
doan
sufficient
to
last
us
until
we
reached
dodge
a
good
month
journey
yet
over
it
must
go
and
we
kept
a
string
of
horsemen
crossing
and
recrossing
for
an
hour
carrying
everything
from
pots
and
pans
to
axle
grease
as
well
as
the
staples
of
life
when
we
had
got
the
contents
of
the
wagon
finally
over
and
reloaded
there
remained
nothing
but
crossing
the
saddle
stock
the
wagon
mules
had
been
turned
loose
harnessed
while
we
were
crossing
the
wagon
and
other
effects
and
when
we
drove
the
into
the
river
one
of
the
wheel
mules
turned
back
and
in
spite
of
every
man
reached
the
bank
again
part
of
the
boys
hurried
the
others
across
but
mccann
and
i
turned
back
after
our
wheeler
we
caught
him
without
any
trouble
but
our
attempt
to
lead
him
across
failed
in
spite
of
all
the
profanity
addressed
personally
to
him
he
proved
a
credit
to
his
sire
and
we
lost
ground
in
trying
to
force
him
into
the
river
the
boys
across
the
river
watched
a
few
minutes
when
all
recrossed
to
our
assistance
time
too
valuable
to
monkey
with
a
mule
said
priest
as
he
rode
up
skin
off
that
harness
it
was
off
at
once
and
we
blindfolded
and
backed
him
up
to
the
river
bank
then
taking
a
rope
around
his
forelegs
we
threw
him
him
and
rolled
him
into
the
water
with
a
rope
around
his
forelegs
and
through
the
ring
in
the
bridle
bit
we
asked
no
further
favors
but
snaked
him
ignominiously
over
to
the
farther
side
and
reharnessed
him
into
the
team
the
afternoon
was
more
than
half
spent
when
we
reached
the
first
bogged
cattle
and
by
the
time
the
wagon
overtook
us
we
had
several
tied
up
and
ready
for
the
mule
team
to
give
us
a
lift
the
herd
had
been
watered
in
the
mean
time
and
was
grazing
about
in
sight
of
the
river
and
as
we
occasionally
drifted
a
freed
animal
out
to
the
herd
we
saw
others
being
turned
in
down
the
river
about
an
hour
before
sunset
flood
rode
up
to
us
and
reported
having
cleared
the
island
ford
while
a
middle
outfit
under
forrest
was
working
down
towards
it
during
the
twilight
hours
of
evening
the
wagon
and
saddle
horses
moved
out
to
the
herd
and
made
ready
to
camp
but
we
remained
until
dark
and
with
but
three
horses
released
a
number
of
light
cows
we
were
the
last
outfit
to
reach
the
wagon
and
as
honeyman
had
tied
up
our
night
horses
there
was
nothing
for
us
to
do
but
eat
and
go
to
bed
to
which
we
required
no
coaxing
for
we
all
knew
that
early
morning
would
find
us
once
more
working
with
bogged
cattle
the
night
passed
without
incident
and
the
next
morning
in
the
division
of
the
forces
priest
was
again
allowed
the
wagon
to
do
the
snaking
out
with
but
only
four
men
counting
mccann
the
remainder
of
the
outfit
was
divided
into
several
gangs
working
near
enough
each
other
to
lend
a
hand
in
case
an
extra
horse
was
needed
on
a
pull
the
third
animal
we
struck
in
the
river
that
morning
was
the
black
steer
that
had
showed
fight
the
day
before
knowing
his
temper
would
not
be
improved
by
soaking
in
the
quicksand
overnight
we
changed
our
tactics
while
we
were
tying
up
the
steer
tail
and
legs
mccann
secreted
his
team
at
a
safe
distance
then
he
took
a
lariat
lashed
the
tongue
of
the
wagon
to
a
cottonwood
tree
and
jacking
up
a
hind
wheel
used
it
as
a
windlass
when
all
was
ready
we
tied
the
loose
end
of
our
cable
rope
to
a
spoke
and
allowing
the
rope
to
coil
on
the
hub
manned
the
windlass
and
drew
him
ashore
when
the
steer
was
freed
mccann
having
no
horse
at
hand
climbed
into
the
wagon
while
the
rest
of
us
sought
safety
in
our
saddles
and
gave
him
a
wide
berth
when
he
came
to
his
feet
he
was
sullen
with
rage
and
refused
to
move
out
of
his
tracks
priest
rode
out
and
baited
him
at
a
distance
and
mccann
from
his
safe
position
attempted
to
give
him
a
scare
when
he
savagely
charged
the
wagon
mccann
reached
down
and
securing
a
handful
of
flour
dashed
it
into
his
eyes
which
made
him
back
away
and
kneeling
he
fell
to
cutting
the
sand
with
his
horns
rising
he
charged
the
wagon
a
second
time
and
catching
the
wagon
sheet
with
his
horns
tore
two
slits
in
it
like
slashes
of
a
razor
by
this
time
the
rebel
ventured
a
little
nearer
and
attracted
the
steer
attention
he
started
for
priest
who
gave
the
quirt
to
his
horse
and
for
the
first
quarter
mile
had
a
close
race
the
steer
however
weakened
by
the
severe
treatment
he
had
been
subjected
to
soon
fell
to
the
rear
and
gave
up
the
chase
and
continued
on
his
way
to
the
herd
after
this
incident
we
worked
down
the
river
until
the
outfits
met
we
finished
the
work
before
noon
having
lost
three
full
days
by
the
quicksands
of
the
canadian
as
we
pulled
into
the
trail
that
afternoon
near
the
first
divide
and
looked
back
to
take
a
parting
glance
at
the
river
we
saw
a
dust
cloud
across
the
canadian
which
we
knew
must
he
the
ellison
herd
under
nat
straw
quince
forrest
noticing
it
at
the
same
time
as
i
did
rode
forward
and
said
to
me
well
old
nat
will
get
it
in
the
neck
this
time
if
that
old
girl
dallies
with
him
as
she
did
with
us
i
do
wish
him
any
bad
luck
but
i
do
hope
he
bog
enough
cattle
to
keep
his
hand
in
practice
it
will
be
just
about
his
luck
though
to
find
it
settled
and
solid
enough
to
cross
and
the
next
morning
we
saw
his
signal
in
the
sky
about
the
same
distance
behind
us
and
knew
he
had
forded
without
any
serious
trouble
chapter
xii
the
north
fork
there
was
never
very
much
love
lost
between
government
soldiers
and
our
tribe
so
we
swept
past
camp
supply
in
contempt
a
few
days
later
and
crossed
the
north
fork
of
the
canadian
to
camp
for
the
night
flood
and
mccann
went
into
the
post
as
our
supply
of
flour
and
navy
beans
was
running
rather
low
and
our
foreman
had
hopes
that
he
might
be
able
to
get
enough
of
these
staples
from
the
sutler
to
last
until
we
reached
dodge
he
also
hoped
to
receive
some
word
from
lovell
the
rest
of
us
had
no
lack
of
occupation
as
a
result
of
a
chance
find
of
mine
that
morning
honeyman
had
stood
my
guard
the
night
before
and
in
return
i
had
got
up
when
he
was
called
to
help
rustle
the
horses
we
had
every
horse
under
hand
before
the
sun
peeped
over
the
eastern
horizon
and
when
returning
to
camp
with
the
as
i
rode
through
a
bunch
of
sumach
bush
i
found
a
wild
turkey
nest
with
sixteen
fresh
eggs
in
it
honeyman
rode
up
when
i
dismounted
and
putting
them
in
my
hat
handed
them
up
to
billy
until
i
could
mount
for
they
were
beauties
and
as
precious
to
us
as
gold
there
was
an
egg
for
each
man
in
the
outfit
and
one
over
and
mccann
threw
a
heap
of
swagger
into
the
inquiry
gentlemen
how
will
you
have
your
eggs
this
morning
just
as
though
it
was
an
everyday
affair
they
were
issued
to
us
fried
and
i
naturally
felt
that
the
odd
egg
by
rights
ought
to
fall
to
me
but
the
opposing
majority
was
formidable
fourteen
to
one
so
i
yielded
a
number
of
ways
were
suggested
to
allot
the
odd
egg
but
the
gambling
fever
in
us
being
rabid
raffling
or
playing
cards
for
it
seemed
to
be
the
proper
caper
raffling
had
few
advocates
it
reflects
on
any
man
raising
said
quince
forrest
contemptuously
to
suggest
the
idea
of
raffling
when
we
got
cards
and
all
night
to
play
for
that
egg
the
very
idea
of
raffling
for
it
i
like
to
see
myself
pulling
straws
or
drawing
numbers
from
a
hat
like
some
giggling
girl
at
a
church
fair
poker
is
a
science
the
highest
court
in
texas
has
said
so
and
i
want
some
little
show
for
my
interest
in
that
speckled
egg
what
have
i
spent
twenty
years
learning
the
game
for
will
some
of
you
tell
me
why
it
lets
me
out
if
you
raffle
it
the
argument
remained
unanswered
and
the
play
for
it
gave
interest
to
that
night
as
soon
as
supper
was
over
and
the
first
guard
had
taken
the
herd
the
poker
game
opened
each
man
being
given
ten
beans
for
chips
we
had
only
one
deck
of
cards
so
one
game
was
all
that
could
be
run
at
a
time
but
there
were
six
players
and
when
one
was
frozen
out
another
sat
in
and
took
his
place
as
wood
was
plentiful
we
had
a
good
fire
and
this
with
the
aid
of
the
cook
lantern
gave
an
abundance
of
light
we
unrolled
a
bed
to
serve
as
a
table
sat
down
on
it
indian
fashion
and
as
fast
as
one
seat
was
vacated
there
was
a
man
ready
to
fill
it
for
we
were
impatient
for
our
turns
in
the
game
the
talk
turned
on
an
accident
which
had
happened
that
afternoon
while
we
were
crossing
the
north
fork
of
the
canadian
bob
blades
attempted
to
ride
out
of
the
river
below
the
crossing
when
his
horse
bogged
down
he
instantly
dismounted
and
his
horse
after
floundering
around
scrambled
out
and
up
the
bank
but
with
a
broken
leg
our
foreman
had
ridden
up
and
ordered
the
horse
unsaddled
and
shot
to
put
him
out
of
his
suffering
while
waiting
our
turns
the
accident
to
the
horse
was
referred
to
several
times
and
finally
blades
who
was
sitting
in
the
game
turned
to
us
who
were
lounging
around
the
fire
and
asked
did
you
all
notice
that
look
he
gave
me
as
i
was
uncinching
the
saddle
if
he
had
been
human
he
might
have
told
what
that
look
meant
good
thing
he
was
a
horse
and
could
realize
from
then
on
the
yarning
and
conversation
was
strictly
it
was
always
a
mystery
to
me
said
billy
honeyman
how
a
mexican
or
indian
knows
so
much
more
about
a
horse
than
any
of
us
i
have
seen
them
trail
a
horse
across
a
country
for
miles
riding
in
a
long
lope
with
not
a
trace
or
sign
visible
to
me
i
was
helping
a
horseman
once
to
drive
a
herd
of
horses
to
san
antonio
from
the
lower
rio
grande
country
we
were
driving
them
to
market
and
as
there
were
no
railroads
south
then
we
had
to
take
along
saddle
horses
to
ride
home
on
after
disposing
of
the
herd
we
always
took
favorite
horses
which
we
did
wish
to
sell
generally
two
apiece
for
that
purpose
this
time
when
we
were
at
least
a
hundred
miles
from
the
ranch
a
mexican
who
had
brought
along
a
pet
horse
to
ride
home
thought
he
hobble
this
pet
one
night
fancying
the
animal
would
leave
the
others
well
next
morning
his
pet
was
missing
we
scoured
the
country
around
and
the
trail
we
had
come
over
for
ten
miles
but
no
horse
as
the
country
was
all
open
we
felt
positive
he
would
go
back
to
the
ranch
two
days
later
and
about
forty
miles
higher
up
the
road
the
mexican
was
riding
in
the
lead
of
the
herd
when
suddenly
he
reined
in
his
horse
throwing
him
back
on
his
haunches
and
waved
for
some
of
us
to
come
to
him
never
taking
his
eyes
off
what
he
saw
in
the
road
the
owner
was
riding
on
one
point
of
the
herd
and
i
on
the
other
we
hurried
around
to
him
and
both
rode
up
at
the
same
time
when
the
vaquero
blurted
out
my
horse
track
horse
asked
the
owner
own
the
horse
we
lost
two
days
ago
replied
the
mexican
do
you
know
it
your
horse
track
from
the
thousands
of
others
that
fill
the
road
demanded
his
employer
tomas
said
the
aztec
lifting
his
hat
do
i
know
your
step
or
voice
from
a
thousand
others
we
laughed
at
him
he
had
been
a
peon
and
that
made
him
respect
our
opinions
at
least
he
avoided
differing
with
us
but
as
we
drove
on
that
afternoon
we
could
see
him
in
the
lead
watching
for
that
horse
track
several
times
he
turned
in
his
saddle
and
looked
back
pointed
to
some
track
in
the
road
and
lifted
his
hat
to
us
at
camp
that
night
we
tried
to
draw
him
out
but
he
was
silent
but
when
we
were
nearing
san
antonio
we
overtook
a
number
of
wagons
loaded
with
wool
lying
over
as
it
was
sunday
and
there
among
their
horses
and
mules
was
our
mexican
missing
horse
the
owner
of
the
wagons
explained
how
he
came
to
have
the
horse
the
animal
had
come
to
his
camp
one
morning
back
about
twenty
miles
from
where
we
had
lost
him
while
he
was
feeding
grain
to
his
work
stock
and
being
a
pet
insisted
on
being
fed
since
then
i
have
always
had
a
lot
of
respect
for
a
greaser
opinion
regarding
a
horse
turkey
eggs
is
too
rich
for
my
blood
said
bob
blades
rising
from
the
game
i
do
care
a
continental
who
wins
the
egg
now
for
whenever
i
get
three
queens
pat
beat
by
a
four
card
draw
i
have
misgivings
about
the
deal
and
old
quince
thinks
he
can
stack
cards
he
could
stack
hay
speaking
about
mexicans
and
indians
said
wyatt
roundtree
i
got
more
use
for
a
good
horse
than
i
have
for
either
of
those
grades
of
humanity
i
had
a
little
experience
over
east
here
on
the
cut
off
from
the
chisholm
trail
a
few
years
ago
that
gave
me
all
the
injun
i
want
for
some
time
to
come
a
band
of
renegade
cheyennes
had
hung
along
the
trail
for
several
years
scaring
or
begging
passing
herds
into
giving
them
a
beef
of
course
all
the
cattle
herds
had
more
or
less
strays
among
them
so
it
was
easier
to
cut
out
one
of
these
than
to
argue
the
matter
there
was
plenty
of
herds
on
the
trail
then
so
this
band
of
indians
got
bolder
than
bandits
in
the
year
i
speaking
of
i
went
up
with
a
herd
of
horses
belonging
to
a
texas
man
who
was
in
charge
with
us
when
we
came
along
with
our
horses
only
six
men
all
told
the
chief
of
the
band
called
running
bull
sheep
got
on
the
bluff
bigger
than
a
wolf
and
demanded
six
horses
well
that
texan
was
looking
for
any
particular
injun
that
day
to
give
six
of
his
own
dear
horses
to
so
we
just
drove
on
paying
no
attention
to
bull
sheep
about
half
a
mile
farther
up
the
trail
the
chief
overtook
us
with
all
his
bucks
and
they
were
an
ugly
looking
lot
well
this
time
he
held
up
four
fingers
meaning
that
four
horses
would
be
acceptable
but
the
texan
was
recognizing
the
indian
levy
of
taxation
that
year
when
he
refused
them
the
indians
never
parleyed
a
moment
but
set
up
a
yi
and
began
circling
round
the
herd
on
their
ponies
bull
sheep
in
the
lead
as
the
chief
passed
the
owner
his
horse
on
a
run
he
gave
a
special
shrill
yi
whipped
a
short
carbine
out
of
its
scabbard
and
shot
twice
into
the
rear
of
the
herd
never
for
a
moment
considering
consequences
the
texan
brought
his
into
action
it
was
a
long
purty
shot
and
bull
sheep
threw
his
hands
in
the
air
and
came
off
his
horse
backward
hard
hit
this
shooting
in
the
rear
of
the
horses
gave
them
such
a
scare
that
we
never
checked
them
short
of
a
mile
while
the
other
indians
were
holding
a
little
powwow
over
their
chief
we
were
making
good
time
in
the
other
direction
considering
that
we
had
over
eight
hundred
loose
horses
fortunately
our
wagon
and
saddle
horses
had
gone
ahead
that
morning
but
in
the
run
we
overtook
them
as
soon
as
we
checked
the
herd
from
its
scare
we
turned
them
up
the
trail
stretched
ropes
from
the
wheels
of
the
wagon
ran
the
saddle
horses
in
and
changed
mounts
just
a
little
quicker
than
i
ever
saw
it
done
before
or
since
the
cook
had
a
saddle
in
the
wagon
so
we
caught
him
up
a
horse
clapped
leather
on
him
and
tied
him
behind
the
wagon
in
case
of
an
emergency
and
you
can
just
bet
we
changed
to
our
best
horses
when
we
overtook
the
herd
we
were
at
least
a
mile
and
a
half
from
where
the
shooting
occurred
and
there
was
no
indian
in
sight
but
we
felt
that
they
had
given
it
up
we
had
long
to
wait
though
we
would
have
waited
willingly
before
we
heard
their
yells
and
saw
the
dust
rising
in
clouds
behind
us
we
quit
the
herd
and
wagon
right
there
and
rode
for
a
swell
of
ground
ahead
that
would
give
us
a
rear
view
of
the
scenery
the
first
view
we
caught
of
them
was
not
very
encouraging
they
were
riding
after
us
like
fiends
and
kicking
up
a
dust
like
a
wind
storm
we
had
nothing
but
no
good
for
long
range
the
owner
of
the
horses
admitted
that
it
was
useless
to
try
to
save
the
herd
now
and
if
our
scalps
were
worth
saving
it
was
high
time
to
make
ourselves
scarce
cantonment
was
a
government
post
about
miles
away
so
we
rode
for
it
our
horses
were
good
spanish
stock
and
the
little
ponies
were
no
match
for
them
but
not
satisfied
with
the
wagon
and
herd
falling
into
their
hands
they
followed
us
until
we
were
within
sight
of
the
post
as
hard
luck
would
have
it
the
cavalry
stationed
at
this
post
were
off
on
some
escort
duty
and
the
infantry
were
useless
in
this
case
when
the
cavalry
returned
a
few
days
later
they
tried
to
round
up
those
indians
and
the
indian
agent
used
his
influence
but
the
horses
were
so
divided
up
and
scattered
that
they
were
never
recovered
and
did
the
man
lose
his
horses
entirely
asked
flood
who
had
anteed
up
his
last
bean
and
joined
us
he
did
there
was
i
remember
a
tin
horn
lawyer
up
about
dodge
who
thought
he
could
recover
their
value
as
these
were
agency
indians
and
the
government
owed
them
money
but
all
i
got
for
three
months
wages
due
me
was
the
horse
i
got
away
on
mccann
had
been
frozen
out
during
roundtree
yarn
and
had
joined
the
crowd
of
on
the
other
side
of
the
fire
forrest
was
feeling
quite
gala
and
took
a
special
delight
in
taunting
the
vanquished
as
they
dropped
out
is
mccann
there
inquired
he
well
knowing
he
was
i
just
wanted
to
ask
would
it
be
any
trouble
to
poach
that
egg
for
my
breakfast
and
serve
it
with
a
bit
of
toast
i
feeling
a
little
bit
dainty
poach
it
for
me
wo
you
please
mccann
never
moved
a
muscle
as
he
replied
will
you
please
go
to
hell
the
continued
for
some
time
and
while
fox
quarternight
was
regaling
us
with
the
history
of
a
little
black
mare
that
a
neighbor
of
theirs
in
kentucky
owned
a
dispute
arose
in
the
card
game
regarding
the
rules
of
discard
and
draw
i
too
old
a
girl
said
the
rebel
angrily
to
forrest
to
allow
a
pullet
like
you
to
teach
me
this
game
when
it
my
deal
i
discard
just
when
i
please
and
it
none
of
your
business
so
long
as
i
keep
within
the
rules
of
the
game
which
sounded
final
and
the
game
continued
quarternight
picked
up
the
broken
thread
of
his
narrative
and
the
first
warning
we
had
of
the
lateness
of
the
hour
was
bull
durham
calling
to
us
from
the
game
one
of
you
fellows
can
have
my
place
just
as
soon
as
we
play
this
jack
pot
i
got
to
saddle
my
horse
and
get
ready
for
our
guard
oh
i
on
velvet
anyhow
and
before
this
game
ends
i
make
old
quince
curl
his
tail
i
got
him
going
south
now
it
took
me
only
a
few
minutes
to
lose
my
chance
at
the
turkey
egg
and
i
sought
my
blankets
at
one
when
our
guard
was
called
the
beans
were
almost
equally
divided
among
priest
stallings
and
durham
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
forrest
whom
we
all
wanted
to
see
beaten
had
met
defeat
they
agreed
to
cut
the
cards
for
the
egg
stallings
winning
we
mounted
our
horses
and
rode
out
into
the
night
and
the

dodge
at
camp
supply
flood
received
a
letter
from
lovell
requesting
him
to
come
on
into
dodge
ahead
of
the
cattle
so
after
the
first
camp
above
the
cimarron
flood
caught
up
a
favorite
horse
informed
the
outfit
that
he
was
going
to
quit
us
for
a
few
days
and
designated
quince
forrest
as
the
during
his
absence
you
have
a
wide
open
country
from
here
into
dodge
said
he
when
ready
to
start
and
i
make
inquiry
for
you
daily
from
men
coming
in
or
from
the
buckboard
which
carries
the
mail
to
supply
i
try
to
meet
you
at
mulberry
creek
which
is
about
ten
miles
south
of
dodge
i
make
that
town
and
you
ought
to
make
the
mulberry
in
two
days
you
will
see
the
smoke
of
passing
trains
to
the
north
of
the
arkansaw
from
the
first
divide
south
of
mulberry
when
you
reach
that
creek
in
case
i
do
meet
you
hold
the
herd
there
and
three
or
four
of
you
can
come
on
into

but
i
almost
certain
to
meet
you
he
called
back
as
he
rode
away
priest
said
quince
when
our
foreman
had
gone
i
reckon
you
handle
your
herd
to
suit
the
old
man
when
he
left
us
that
time
at
buffalo
gap
but
i
think
he
used
rare
judgment
this
time
in
selecting
a
the
only
thing
that
frets
me
is
i
afraid
he
meet
us
before
we
reach
the
mulberry
and
that
wo
give
me
any
chance
to
go
in
ahead
like
a
sure
enough
foreman
fact
is
i
have
business
there
i
deposited
a
few
months
wages
at
the
long
branch
gambling
house
last
year
when
i
was
in
dodge
and
failed
to
take
a
receipt
i
just
want
to
drop
in
and
make
inquiry
if
they
gave
me
credit
and
if
the
account
is
drawing
interest
i
think
it
all
right
for
the
man
i
deposited
it
with
was
a
clever
fellow
and
asked
me
to
have
a
drink
with
him
just
as
i
was
leaving
still
i
like
to
step
in
and
see
him
again
early
in
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
after
our
foreman
left
us
we
sighted
the
smoke
of
passing
trains
though
they
were
at
least
fifteen
miles
distant
and
long
before
we
reached
the
mulberry
a
livery
rig
came
down
the
trail
to
meet
us
to
forrest
chagrin
flood
all
dressed
up
and
with
a
white
collar
on
was
the
driver
while
on
a
back
seat
sat
don
lovell
and
another
cowman
by
the
name
of
mcnulta
every
rascal
of
us
gave
old
man
don
the
glad
hand
as
they
drove
around
the
herd
while
he
liberal
and
delighted
as
a
bridegroom
passed
out
the
cigars
by
the
handful
the
cattle
were
looking
fine
which
put
the
old
man
in
high
spirits
and
he
inquired
of
each
of
us
if
our
health
was
good
and
if
flood
had
fed
us
well
they
loitered
around
the
herd
the
rest
of
the
evening
until
we
threw
off
the
trail
to
graze
and
camp
for
the
night
when
lovell
declared
his
intention
of
staying
all
night
with
the
outfit
while
we
were
catching
horses
during
the
evening
lovell
came
up
to
me
where
i
was
saddling
my
night
horse
and
recognizing
me
gave
me
news
of
my
brother
bob
i
had
a
letter
yesterday
from
him
he
said
written
from
red
fork
which
is
just
north
of
the
cimarron
river
over
on
the
chisholm
route
he
reports
everything
going
along
nicely
and
i
expecting
him
to
show
up
here
within
a
week
his
herd
are
all
beef
steers
and
are
contracted
for
delivery
at
the
crow
indian
agency
he
not
driving
as
fast
as
flood
but
we
got
to
have
our
beef
for
that
delivery
in
better
condition
as
they
have
a
new
agent
there
this
year
and
he
may
be
one
of
these
knowing
fellows
sorry
you
see
your
brother
but
if
you
have
any
word
to
send
him
i
deliver
it
i
thanked
him
for
the
interest
he
had
taken
in
me
and
assured
him
that
i
had
no
news
for
robert
but
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
inquire
if
our
middle
brother
zack
quirk
was
on
the
trail
with
any
of
his
herds
lovell
knew
him
but
felt
positive
he
was
not
with
any
of
his
outfits
we
had
an
easy
night
with
the
cattle
lovell
insisted
on
standing
a
guard
so
he
took
rod
wheat
horse
and
stood
the
first
watch
and
after
returning
to
the
wagon
he
and
mcnulta
to
our
great
interest
argued
the
merits
of
the
different
trails
until
near
midnight
mcnulta
had
two
herds
coming
in
on
the
chisholm
trail
while
lovell
had
two
herds
on
the
western
and
only
one
on
the
chisholm
the
next
morning
forrest
who
was
again
in
charge
received
orders
to
cross
the
arkansaw
river
shortly
after
noon
and
then
let
half
the
outfit
come
into
town
the
old
trail
crossed
the
river
about
a
mile
above
the
present
town
of
dodge
city
kansas
so
when
we
changed
horses
at
noon
the
first
and
second
guards
caught
up
their
top
horses
ransacked
their
war
bags
and
donned
their
best
toggery
we
crossed
the
river
about
one
in
order
to
give
the
boys
a
good
holiday
the
stage
of
water
making
the
river
easily
fordable
mccann
after
dinner
was
over
drove
down
on
the
south
side
for
the
benefit
of
a
bridge
which
spanned
the
river
opposite
the
town
it
was
the
first
bridge
he
had
been
able
to
take
advantage
of
in
over
a
thousand
miles
of
travel
and
he
spurned
the
cattle
ford
as
though
he
had
never
crossed
at
one
once
safely
over
the
river
and
with
the
understanding
that
the
herd
would
camp
for
the
night
about
six
miles
north
on
duck
creek
six
of
our
men
quit
us
and
rode
for
the
town
in
a
long
gallop
before
the
rig
left
us
in
the
morning
mcnulta
who
was
thoroughly
familiar
with
dodge
and
an
older
man
than
lovell
in
a
friendly
and
fatherly
spirit
seeing
that
many
of
us
were
youngsters
had
given
us
an
earnest
talk
and
plenty
of
good
advice
i
been
in
dodge
every
summer
since
said
the
old
cowman
and
i
can
give
you
boys
some
points
dodge
is
one
town
where
the
average
bad
man
of
the
west
not
only
finds
his
equal
but
finds
himself
badly
handicapped
the
buffalo
hunters
and
range
men
have
protested
against
the
iron
rule
of
dodge
peace
officers
and
nearly
every
protest
has
cost
human
life
do
ever
get
the
impression
that
you
can
ride
your
horses
into
a
saloon
or
shoot
out
the
lights
in
dodge
it
may
go
somewhere
else
but
it
do
go
there
so
i
want
to
warn
you
to
behave
yourselves
you
can
wear
your
into
town
but
you
better
leave
them
at
the
first
place
you
stop
hotel
livery
or
business
house
and
when
you
leave
town
call
for
your
pistols
but
do
ride
out
shooting
omit
that
most
cowboys
think
it
an
infringement
on
their
rights
to
give
up
shooting
in
town
and
if
it
is
it
stands
for
your
are
no
match
for
winchesters
and
buckshot
and
dodge
officers
are
as
game
a
set
of
men
as
ever
faced
danger
nearly
a
generation
has
passed
since
mcnulta
the
texan
cattle
drover
gave
our
outfit
this
advice
one
june
morning
on
the
mulberry
and
in
setting
down
this
record
i
have
only
to
scan
the
roster
of
the
peace
officials
of
dodge
city
to
admit
its
correctness
among
the
names
that
graced
the
official
roster
during
the
brief
span
of
the
trail
days
were
the
brothers
ed
jim
and
bat
masterson
wyatt
earp
jack
bridges
doc
holliday
charles
bassett
william
tillman
shotgun
collins
joshua
webb
mayor
webster
and
mysterious
dave
mather
the
puppets
of
no
romance
ever
written
can
compare
with
these
officers
in
fearlessness
and
let
it
be
understood
there
were
plenty
to
protest
against
their
rule
almost
daily
during
the
range
season
some
equally
fearless
individual
defied
them
throw
up
your
hands
and
surrender
said
an
officer
to
a
texas
cowboy
who
had
spurred
an
excitable
horse
until
it
was
rearing
and
plunging
in
the
street
leveling
meanwhile
a
shotgun
at
the
horseman
not
to
you
you
s
of
a
b
was
the
instant
reply
accompanied
by
a
shot
the
officer
staggered
back
mortally
wounded
but
recovered
himself
and
the
next
instant
the
cowboy
reeled
from
his
saddle
a
load
of
buckshot
through
his
breast
after
the
boys
left
us
for
town
the
remainder
of
us
belonging
to
the
third
and
fourth
guard
grazed
the
cattle
forward
leisurely
during
the
afternoon
through
cattle
herds
were
in
sight
both
up
and
down
the
river
on
either
side
and
on
crossing
the
mulberry
the
day
before
we
learned
that
several
herds
were
holding
out
as
far
south
as
that
stream
while
mcnulta
had
reported
over
forty
herds
as
having
already
passed
northward
on
the
trail
dodge
was
the
meeting
point
for
buyers
from
every
quarter
often
herds
would
sell
at
dodge
whose
destination
for
delivery
was
beyond
the
yellowstone
in
montana
herds
frequently
changed
owners
when
the
buyer
never
saw
the
cattle
a
yearling
was
a
yearling
and
a
two
year
old
was
a
two
year
old
and
the
seller
word
that
they
were
as
good
or
better
than
the
string
i
sold
you
last
year
was
sufficient
cattle
were
classified
as
northern
central
and
southern
animals
and
except
in
case
of
severe
drouth
in
the
preceding
years
were
pretty
nearly
uniform
in
size
throughout
each
section
the
prairie
section
of
the
state
left
its
indelible
imprint
on
the
cattle
bred
in
the
open
country
while
the
coast
as
well
as
the
piney
woods
and
sections
did
the
same
thus
making
classification
easy
mccann
overtook
us
early
in
the
evening
and
being
an
obliging
fellow
was
induced
by
forrest
to
stand
the
first
guard
with
honeyman
so
as
to
make
up
the
proper
number
of
watches
though
with
only
two
men
on
guard
at
a
time
for
it
was
hardly
possible
that
any
of
the
others
would
return
before
daybreak
there
was
much
to
be
seen
in
dodge
and
as
losing
a
night
sleep
on
duty
was
considered
nothing
in
hilarious
recreation
sleep
would
be
entirely
forgotten
mccann
had
not
forgotten
us
but
had
smuggled
out
a
quart
bottle
to
cut
the
alkali
in
our
drinking
water
but
a
quart
amongst
eight
of
us
was
not
dangerous
so
the
night
passed
without
incident
though
we
felt
a
growing
impatience
to
get
into
town
as
we
expected
about
sunrise
the
next
morning
our
men
off
on
holiday
rode
into
camp
having
never
closed
an
eye
during
the
entire
night
they
brought
word
from
flood
that
the
herd
would
only
graze
over
to
saw
log
creek
that
day
so
as
to
let
the
remainder
of
us
have
a
day
and
night
in
town
lovell
would
only
advance
half
a
month
wages
dollars
to
the
man
it
was
ample
for
any
personal
needs
though
we
had
nearly
three
wages
due
and
no
one
protested
for
the
old
man
was
generally
right
in
his
decisions
according
to
their
report
the
boys
had
had
a
time
old
man
don
having
been
out
with
them
all
night
it
seems
that
mcnulta
stood
in
well
with
a
class
of
practical
jokers
which
included
the
officials
of
the
town
and
whenever
there
was
anything
on
the
tapis
he
always
got
the
word
for
himself
and
friends
during
breakfast
fox
quarternight
told
this
incident
of
the
evening
some
professor
a
professor
in
the
occult
sciences
i
think
he
called
himself
had
written
to
the
mayor
to
know
what
kind
of
a
point
dodge
would
be
for
a
lecture
the
lecture
was
to
be
free
but
he
also
intimated
that
he
had
a
card
or
two
on
the
side
up
his
sleeve
by
which
he
expected
to
graft
onto
some
of
the
coin
of
the
realm
from
the
wayfaring
man
as
well
as
the
citizen
the
mayor
turned
the
letter
over
to
bat
masterson
the
city
marshal
who
answered
it
and
invited
the
professor
to
come
on
assuring
him
that
he
was
deeply
interested
in
the
occult
sciences
personally
and
would
take
pleasure
in
securing
him
a
hall
and
a
date
besides
announcing
his
coming
through
the
papers
well
he
was
billed
to
deliver
his
lecture
last
night
those
old
long
horns
mcnulta
and
lovell
got
us
in
with
the
crowd
and
while
they
did
know
exactly
what
was
coming
they
assured
us
that
we
afford
to
miss
it
well
at
the
appointed
hour
in
the
evening
the
hall
was
packed
not
over
half
being
able
to
find
seats
it
is
safe
to
say
there
were
over
five
hundred
men
present
as
it
was
announced
for
only
every
gambler
in
town
was
there
with
a
fair
sprinkling
of
cowmen
and
our
tribe
at
the
appointed
hour
masterson
as
chairman
rapped
for
order
and
in
a
neat
little
speech
announced
the
object
of
the
meeting
bat
mentioned
the
lack
of
interest
in
the
west
in
the
higher
arts
and
sciences
and
bespoke
our
careful
attention
to
the
subject
under
consideration
for
the
evening
he
said
he
felt
it
hardly
necessary
to
urge
the
importance
of
good
order
but
if
any
one
had
come
out
of
idle
curiosity
or
bent
on
mischief
as
chairman
of
the
meeting
and
a
peace
officer
of
the
city
he
would
certainly
brook
no
interruption
after
a
few
other
appropriate
remarks
he
introduced
the
speaker
as
the
noted
scientist
the
professor
was
an
fellow
and
led
off
on
the
prelude
to
his
lecture
while
the
audience
was
as
quiet
as
mice
and
as
grave
as
owls
after
he
had
spoken
about
five
minutes
and
was
getting
warmed
up
to
his
subject
he
made
an
assertion
which
sounded
a
little
fishy
and
some
one
back
in
the
audience
blurted
out
a
damned
lie
the
speaker
halted
in
his
discourse
and
looked
at
masterson
who
arose
and
drawing
two
looked
the
audience
over
as
if
trying
to
locate
the
offender
laying
the
guns
down
on
the
table
he
informed
the
meeting
that
another
interruption
would
cost
the
offender
his
life
if
he
had
to
follow
him
to
the
rio
grande
or
the
british
possessions
he
then
asked
the
professor
as
there
would
be
no
further
interruptions
to
proceed
with
his
lecture
the
professor
hesitated
about
going
on
when
masterson
assured
him
that
it
was
evident
that
his
audience
with
the
exception
of
one
skulking
coyote
was
deeply
interested
in
the
subject
but
that
no
one
man
could
interfere
with
the
freedom
of
speech
in
dodge
as
long
as
it
was
a
free
country
and
he
was
city
marshal
after
this
little
talk
the
speaker
braced
up
and
launched
out
again
on
his
lecture
when
he
was
once
more
under
good
headway
he
had
occasion
to
relate
an
exhibition
which
he
had
witnessed
while
studying
his
profession
in
india
the
incident
related
was
a
trifle
rank
for
any
one
to
swallow
raw
when
the
same
party
who
had
interrupted
before
sang
out
another
damn
lie
masterson
came
to
his
feet
like
a
flash
a
gun
in
each
hand
saying
up
you
measly
skunk
so
i
can
see
you
half
a
dozen
men
rose
in
different
parts
of
the
house
and
cut
loose
at
him
and
as
they
did
so
the
lights
went
out
and
the
room
filled
with
smoke
masterson
was
blazing
away
with
two
guns
which
so
lighted
up
the
rostrum
that
we
could
see
the
professor
crouching
under
the
table
of
course
they
were
using
blank
cartridges
but
the
audience
raised
the
long
yell
and
poured
out
through
the
windows
and
doors
and
the
lecture
was
over
a
couple
of
police
came
in
later
so
mcnulta
said
escorted
the
professor
to
his
room
in
the
hotel
and
quietly
advised
him
that
dodge
was
hardly
capable
of
appreciating
anything
so
advanced
as
a
lecture
on
the
occult
sciences
breakfast
over
honeyman
ran
in
the
and
we
caught
the
best
horses
in
our
mounts
on
which
to
pay
our
respects
to
dodge
forrest
detailed
rod
wheat
to
wrangle
the
horses
for
we
intended
to
take
honeyman
with
us
as
it
was
only
about
six
miles
over
to
the
saw
log
quince
advised
that
they
graze
along
duck
creek
until
after
dinner
and
then
graze
over
to
the
former
stream
during
the
afternoon
before
leaving
we
rode
over
and
looked
out
the
trail
after
it
left
duck
for
it
was
quite
possible
that
we
might
return
during
the
night
and
we
requested
mccann
to
hang
out
the
lantern
elevated
on
the
end
of
the
wagon
tongue
as
a
beacon
after
taking
our
bearings
we
reined
southward
over
the
divide
to
dodge
the
very
first
thing
i
do
said
quince
forrest
as
we
rode
leisurely
along
after
i
get
a
shave
and
and
buy
what
few
tricks
i
need
is
to
hunt
up
that
gambler
in
the
long
branch
and
ask
him
to
take
a
drink
with
me
i
took
the
parting
one
on
him
then
i
simply
set
in
and
win
back
every
dollar
i
lost
there
last
year
something
in
this
northern
air
that
i
breathe
in
this
morning
that
tells
me
that
this
is
my
lucky
day
you
other
kids
had
better
let
the
games
alone
and
save
your
money
to
buy
red
silk
handkerchiefs
and
soda
water
and
such
harmless
jimcracks
the
fact
that
the
rebel
was
ten
years
his
senior
never
entered
his
mind
as
he
gave
us
this
fatherly
advice
though
to
be
sure
the
majority
of
us
were
his
juniors
in
years
on
reaching
dodge
we
rode
up
to
the
wright
house
where
flood
met
us
and
directed
our
cavalcade
across
the
railroad
to
a
livery
stable
the
proprietor
of
which
was
a
friend
of
lovell
we
unsaddled
and
turned
our
horses
into
a
large
corral
and
while
we
were
in
the
office
of
the
livery
surrendering
our
artillery
flood
came
in
and
handed
each
of
us
dollars
in
gold
warning
us
that
when
that
was
gone
no
more
would
be
advanced
on
receipt
of
the
money
we
scattered
like
partridges
before
a
gunner
within
an
hour
or
two
we
began
to
return
to
the
stable
by
ones
and
twos
and
were
stowing
into
our
saddle
pockets
our
purchases
which
ran
from
needles
and
thread
to
cartridges
every
mother
son
reflecting
the
art
of
the
barber
while
john
officer
had
his
blond
mustaches
blackened
waxed
and
curled
like
a
french
dancing
master
if
some
of
you
boys
will
hold
him
said
moss
strayhorn
commenting
on
officer
appearance
i
like
to
take
a
good
smell
of
him
just
to
see
if
he
took
oil
up
there
where
the
end
of
his
neck
haired
over
as
officer
already
had
several
drinks
comfortably
stowed
away
under
his
belt
and
stood
up
strong
six
feet
two
none
of
us
volunteered
after
packing
away
our
plunder
we
sauntered
around
town
drinking
moderately
and
visiting
the
various
saloons
and
gambling
houses
i
clung
to
my
bunkie
the
rebel
during
the
rounds
for
i
had
learned
to
like
him
and
had
confidence
he
would
lead
me
into
no
indiscretions
at
the
long
branch
we
found
quince
forrest
and
wyatt
roundtree
playing
the
faro
bank
the
former
keeping
cases
they
never
recognized
us
but
were
answering
a
great
many
questions
asked
by
the
dealer
and
lookout
regarding
the
possible
volume
of
the
cattle
drive
that
year
down
at
another
gambling
house
the
rebel
met
ben
thompson
a
faro
dealer
not
on
duty
and
an
old
cavalry
comrade
and
the
two
cronied
around
for
over
an
hour
like
long
lost
brothers
pledging
anew
their
friendship
over
several
social
glasses
in
which
i
was
always
included
there
was
no
telling
how
long
this
reunion
would
have
lasted
but
happily
for
my
sake
lovell
who
had
been
asleep
all
the
morning
started
out
to
round
us
up
for
dinner
with
him
at
the
wright
house
which
was
at
that
day
a
famous
hostelry
patronized
almost
exclusively
by
the
texas
cowmen
and
cattle
buyers
we
made
the
rounds
of
the
gambling
houses
looking
for
our
crowd
we
ran
across
three
of
the
boys
piking
at
a
monte
game
who
came
with
us
reluctantly
then
guided
by
lovell
we
started
for
the
long
branch
where
we
felt
certain
we
would
find
forrest
and
roundtree
if
they
had
any
money
left
forrest
was
broke
which
made
him
ready
to
come
and
roundtree
though
quite
a
winner
out
of
deference
to
our
wishes
cashed
in
and
joined
us
old
man
don
could
hardly
do
enough
for
us
and
before
we
could
reach
the
wright
house
had
lined
us
up
against
three
different
bars
and
while
i
had
confidence
in
my
navigable
capacity
i
found
they
were
coming
just
a
little
too
fast
and
free
seeing
i
had
scarcely
drunk
anything
in
three
months
but
branch
water
as
we
lined
up
at
the
wright
house
bar
for
the
final
before
dinner
the
rebel
who
was
standing
next
to
me
entered
a
waiver
and
took
a
cigar
which
i
understood
to
be
a
hint
and
i
did
likewise
we
had
a
splendid
dinner
our
outfit
with
mcnulta
occupied
a
table
while
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
was
another
large
table
occupied
principally
by
drovers
who
were
waiting
for
their
herds
to
arrive
among
those
at
the
latter
table
whom
i
now
remember
was
uncle
henry
stevens
jesse
ellison
lum
slaughter
john
blocker
ike
pryor
dun
houston
and
last
but
not
least
colonel
shanghai
pierce
the
latter
was
possibly
the
most
widely
known
cowman
between
the
rio
grande
and
the
british
possessions
he
stood
six
feet
four
in
his
stockings
was
gaunt
and
and
the
possessor
of
a
voice
which
even
in
ordinary
conversation
could
be
distinctly
heard
across
the
street
no
i
not
ship
any
more
cattle
to
your
town
said
pierce
to
a
cattle
solicitor
during
the
dinner
his
voice
in
righteous
indignation
resounding
like
a
foghorn
through
the
until
you
adjust
your
yardage
charges
listen
i
can
go
right
up
into
the
heart
of
your
city
and
get
a
room
for
myself
with
a
nice
clean
bed
in
it
plenty
of
soap
water
and
towels
and
i
can
occupy
that
room
for
hours
for
two
bits
and
your
stockyards
away
out
in
the
suburbs
want
to
charge
me
twenty
cents
a
head
and
let
my
steer
stand
out
in
the
weather
after
dinner
all
the
boys
with
the
exception
of
priest
and
myself
returned
to
the
gambling
houses
as
though
anxious
to
work
overtime
before
leaving
the
hotel
forrest
effected
the
loan
of
ten
from
roundtree
and
the
two
returned
to
the
long
branch
while
the
others
as
eagerly
sought
out
a
monte
game
but
i
was
fascinated
with
the
conversation
of
these
old
cowmen
and
sat
around
for
several
hours
listening
to
their
yarns
and
cattle
talk
i
was
selling
a
thousand
beef
steers
one
time
to
some
yankee
army
contractors
pierce
was
narrating
to
a
circle
of
listeners
and
i
got
the
idea
that
they
were
not
up
to
snuff
in
receiving
cattle
out
on
the
prairie
i
was
holding
a
herd
of
about
three
thousand
and
they
had
agreed
to
take
a
running
cut
which
showed
that
they
had
the
receiving
agent
fixed
well
my
foreman
and
i
were
counting
the
cattle
as
they
came
between
us
but
the
steers
were
wild
coasters
and
came
through
between
us
like
scared
wolves
i
had
lost
the
count
several
times
but
guessed
at
them
and
started
over
the
cattle
still
coming
like
a
whirlwind
and
when
i
thought
about
nine
hundred
had
passed
us
i
cut
them
off
and
sang
out
they
come
and
there
they
go
just
an
even
thousand
by
gatlins
what
do
you
make
it
bill
an
even
thousand
colonel
replied
my
foreman
of
course
the
contractors
were
counting
at
the
same
time
and
i
suppose
did
like
to
admit
they
could
count
a
thousand
cattle
where
anybody
else
could
and
never
asked
for
a
recount
but
accepted
and
paid
for
them
they
had
hired
an
outfit
and
held
the
cattle
outside
that
night
but
the
next
day
when
they
cut
them
into
car
lots
and
shipped
them
they
were
a
hundred
and
eighteen
short
they
wanted
to
come
back
on
me
to
make
them
good
but
shucks
i
was
responsible
if
their
jim
crow
outfit
lost
the
cattle
along
early
in
the
evening
flood
advised
us
boys
to
return
to
the
herd
with
him
but
all
the
crowd
wanted
to
stay
in
town
and
see
the
sights
lovell
interceded
in
our
behalf
and
promised
to
see
that
we
left
town
in
good
time
to
be
in
camp
before
the
herd
was
ready
to
move
the
next
morning
on
this
assurance
flood
saddled
up
and
started
for
the
saw
log
having
ample
time
to
make
the
ride
before
dark
by
this
time
most
of
the
boys
had
worn
off
the
wire
edge
for
gambling
and
were
comparing
notes
three
of
them
were
broke
but
quince
forrest
had
turned
the
tables
and
was
over
a
clean
hundred
winner
for
the
day
those
who
had
no
money
fortunately
had
good
credit
with
those
of
us
who
had
for
there
was
yet
much
to
be
seen
and
in
dodge
in
it
took
money
to
see
the
elephant
there
were
several
variety
theatres
a
number
of
dance
halls
and
other
resorts
which
like
the
wicked
flourish
best
under
darkness
after
supper
just
about
dusk
we
went
over
to
the
stable
caught
our
horses
saddled
them
and
tied
them
up
for
the
night
we
fully
expected
to
leave
town
by
ten
for
it
was
a
good
twelve
mile
ride
to
the
saw
log
in
making
the
rounds
of
the
variety
theatres
and
dance
halls
we
hung
together
lovell
excused
himself
early
in
the
evening
and
at
parting
we
assured
him
that
the
outfit
would
leave
for
camp
before
midnight
we
were
enjoying
ourselves
immensely
over
at
the
lone
star
dance
hall
when
an
incident
occurred
in
which
we
entirely
neglected
the
good
advice
of
mcnulta
and
had
the
sensation
of
hearing
lead
whistle
and
cry
around
our
ears
before
we
got
away
from
town
quince
forrest
was
spending
his
winnings
as
well
as
drinking
freely
and
at
the
end
of
a
quadrille
gave
vent
to
his
hilarity
in
an
comanche
yell
the
bouncer
of
the
dance
hall
of
course
had
his
eye
on
our
crowd
and
at
the
end
of
a
change
took
quince
to
task
he
was
a
surly
brute
and
instead
of
couching
his
request
in
appropriate
language
threatened
to
throw
him
out
of
the
house
forrest
stood
like
one
and
took
the
abuse
for
physically
he
was
no
match
for
the
bouncer
who
was
armed
moreover
and
wore
an
officer
star
i
was
dancing
in
the
same
set
with
a
girl
who
clutched
my
arm
and
wished
to
know
if
my
friend
was
armed
i
assured
her
that
he
was
not
or
we
would
have
had
notice
of
it
before
the
bouncer
invective
was
ended
at
the
conclusion
of
the
dance
quince
and
the
rebel
passed
out
giving
the
rest
of
us
the
word
to
remain
as
though
nothing
was
wrong
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
priest
returned
and
asked
us
to
take
our
leave
one
at
a
time
without
attracting
any
attention
and
meet
at
the
stable
i
remained
until
the
last
and
noticed
the
rebel
and
the
bouncer
taking
a
drink
together
at
the
bar
the
former
apparently
in
a
most
amiable
mood
we
passed
out
together
shortly
afterward
and
found
the
other
boys
mounted
and
awaiting
our
return
it
being
now
about
midnight
it
took
but
a
moment
to
secure
our
guns
and
once
in
the
saddle
we
rode
through
the
town
in
the
direction
of
the
herd
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
we
halted
i
going
back
to
that
dance
hall
said
forrest
and
have
one
round
at
least
with
that
no
man
who
walks
this
old
earth
can
insult
me
as
he
did
not
if
he
has
a
hundred
stars
on
him
if
any
of
you
do
want
to
go
along
ride
right
on
to
camp
but
i
like
to
have
you
all
go
and
when
i
take
his
measure
it
will
be
the
signal
to
the
rest
of
you
to
put
out
the
lights
all
that
going
come
on
there
were
no
dissenters
to
the
programme
i
saw
at
a
glance
that
my
bunkie
was
heart
and
soul
in
the
play
and
took
my
cue
and
kept
my
mouth
shut
we
circled
round
the
town
to
a
vacant
lot
within
a
block
of
the
rear
of
the
dance
hall
honeyman
was
left
to
hold
the
horses
then
taking
off
our
belts
and
hanging
them
on
the
pommels
of
our
saddles
we
secreted
our
inside
the
waistbands
of
our
trousers
the
hall
was
still
crowded
with
the
revelers
when
we
entered
a
few
at
a
time
forrest
and
priest
being
the
last
to
arrive
forrest
had
changed
hats
with
the
rebel
who
always
wore
a
black
one
and
as
the
bouncer
circulated
around
quince
stepped
squarely
in
front
of
him
there
was
no
waste
of
words
but
a
flashed
in
the
lamplight
and
the
bouncer
struck
with
the
fell
like
a
beef
before
the
bewildered
spectators
could
raise
a
hand
five
were
turned
into
the
ceiling
the
lights
went
out
at
the
first
fire
and
amidst
the
rush
of
men
and
the
screaming
of
women
we
reached
the
outside
and
within
a
minute
were
in
our
saddles
all
would
have
gone
well
had
we
returned
by
the
same
route
and
avoided
the
town
but
after
crossing
the
railroad
track
anger
and
pride
having
not
been
properly
satisfied
we
must
ride
through
the
town
on
entering
the
main
street
leading
north
and
opposite
the
bridge
on
the
river
somebody
of
our
party
in
the
rear
turned
his
gun
loose
into
the
air
the
rebel
and
i
were
riding
in
the
lead
and
at
the
clattering
of
hoofs
and
shooting
behind
us
our
horses
started
on
the
run
the
shooting
by
this
time
having
become
general
at
the
second
street
crossing
i
noticed
a
rope
of
fire
belching
from
a
winchester
in
the
doorway
of
a
store
building
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
but
we
were
the
object
of
the
manipulator
of
that
carbine
and
as
we
reached
the
next
cross
street
a
man
kneeling
in
the
shadow
of
a
building
opened
fire
on
us
with
a
priest
reined
in
his
horse
and
not
having
wasted
cartridges
in
the
shooting
returned
the
compliment
until
he
emptied
his
gun
by
this
time
every
officer
in
the
town
was
throwing
lead
after
us
some
of
which
cried
a
little
too
close
for
comfort
when
there
was
no
longer
any
shooting
on
our
flanks
we
turned
into
a
cross
street
and
soon
left
the
lead
behind
us
at
the
outskirts
of
the
town
we
slowed
up
our
horses
and
took
it
leisurely
for
a
mile
or
so
when
quince
forrest
halted
us
and
said
i
going
to
drop
out
here
and
see
if
any
one
follows
us
i
want
to
be
alone
so
that
if
any
officers
try
to
follow
us
up
i
can
have
it
out
with
them
illustration
celebrating
in
dodge
as
there
was
no
time
to
lose
in
parleying
and
as
he
had
a
good
horse
we
rode
away
and
left
him
on
reaching
camp
we
secured
a
few
sleep
but
the
next
morning
to
our
surprise
forrest
failed
to
appear
we
explained
the
situation
to
flood
who
said
if
he
did
not
show
up
by
noon
he
would
go
back
and
look
for
him
we
all
felt
positive
that
he
would
not
dare
to
go
back
to
town
and
if
he
was
lost
as
soon
as
the
sun
arose
he
would
be
able
to
get
his
bearings
while
we
were
nooning
about
seven
miles
north
of
the
saw
log
some
one
noticed
a
buggy
coming
up
the
trail
as
it
came
nearer
we
saw
that
there
were
two
other
occupants
of
the
rig
besides
the
driver
when
it
drew
up
old
quince
still
wearing
the
rebel
hat
stepped
out
of
the
rig
dragged
out
his
saddle
from
under
the
seat
and
invited
his
companions
to
dinner
they
both
declined
when
forrest
taking
out
his
purse
handed
a
gold
piece
to
the
driver
with
an
oath
he
then
asked
the
other
man
what
he
owed
him
but
the
latter
very
haughtily
declined
any
recompense
and
the
conveyance
drove
away
i
suppose
you
fellows
do
know
what
all
this
means
said
quince
as
he
filled
a
plate
and
sat
down
in
the
shade
of
the
wagon
well
that
horse
of
mine
got
a
bullet
plugged
into
him
last
night
as
we
were
leaving
town
and
before
i
could
get
him
to
duck
creek
he
died
on
me
i
carried
my
saddle
and
blankets
until
daylight
when
i
hid
in
a
draw
and
waited
for
something
to
turn
up
i
thought
some
of
you
would
come
back
and
look
for
me
sometime
for
i
knew
you
would
understand
it
when
all
of
a
sudden
here
comes
this
livery
rig
along
with
that
drummer
going
out
to
jetmore
i
believe
he
said
i
explained
what
i
wanted
but
he
decided
that
his
business
was
more
important
than
mine
and
refused
me
i
referred
the
matter
to
judge
colt
and
the
judge
decided
that
it
was
more
important
that
i
overtake
this
herd
i
have
made
him
take
pay
too
only
he
acted
so
mean
about
it
after
dinner
fearing
arrest
forrest
took
a
horse
and
rode
on
ahead
to
the
solomon
river
we
were
a
glum
outfit
that
afternoon
but
after
a
good
night
rest
were
again
as
fresh
as
daisies
when
mccann
started
to
get
breakfast
he
hung
his
coat
on
the
end
of
the
wagon
rod
while
he
went
for
a
bucket
of
water
during
his
absence
john
officer
was
noticed
slipping
something
into
barney
coat
pocket
and
after
breakfast
when
our
cook
went
to
his
coat
for
his
tobacco
he
unearthed
a
lady
cambric
handkerchief
nicely
embroidered
and
a
silver
mounted
garter
he
looked
at
the
articles
a
moment
and
grasping
the
situation
at
a
glance
ran
his
eye
over
the
outfit
for
the
culprit
but
there
was
not
a
word
or
a
smile
he
walked
over
and
threw
the
articles
into
the
fire
remarking
good
whiskey
and
bad
women
will
be
the
ruin
of
you
varmints
yet
chapter
xiv
slaughter
bridge
herds
bound
for
points
beyond
the
yellowstone
in
montana
always
considered
dodge
as
the
halfway
landmark
on
the
trail
though
we
had
hardly
covered
half
the
distance
to
the
destination
of
our
circle
dots
but
with
dodge
in
our
rear
all
felt
that
the
backbone
of
the
drive
was
broken
and
it
was
only
the
middle
of
june
in
order
to
divide
the
night
work
more
equitably
for
the
remainder
of
the
trip
the
first
and
fourth
guards
changed
the
second
and
third
remaining
as
they
were
we
had
begun
to
feel
the
scarcity
of
wood
for
cooking
purposes
some
time
past
and
while
crossing
the
plains
of
western
kansas
we
were
frequently
forced
to
resort
to
the
old
bed
grounds
of
a
year
or
two
previous
for
cattle
chips
these
chips
were
a
poor
substitute
and
we
swung
a
cowskin
under
the
reach
of
the
wagon
so
that
when
we
encountered
wood
on
creeks
and
rivers
we
could
lay
in
a
supply
whenever
our
wagon
was
in
the
rear
the
riders
on
either
side
of
the
herd
were
always
on
the
skirmish
for
fuel
which
they
left
alongside
the
wagon
track
and
our
cook
was
sure
to
stow
it
away
underneath
on
the
cowskin
in
spite
of
any
effort
on
our
part
the
length
of
the
days
made
long
drives
the
rule
the
cattle
could
be
depended
on
to
leave
the
bed
ground
at
dawn
and
before
the
outfit
could
breakfast
secure
mounts
and
overtake
the
herd
they
would
often
have
grazed
forward
two
or
three
miles
often
we
never
threw
them
on
the
trail
at
all
yet
when
it
came
time
to
bed
them
at
night
we
had
covered
twenty
miles
they
were
long
monotonous
days
for
we
were
always
sixteen
to
eighteen
hours
in
the
saddle
while
in
emergencies
we
got
the
benefit
of
the
limit
we
frequently
saw
mirages
though
we
were
never
led
astray
by
shady
groves
of
timber
or
tempting
lakes
of
water
but
always
kept
within
a
mile
or
two
of
the
trail
the
evening
of
the
third
day
after
forrest
left
us
he
returned
as
we
were
bedding
down
the
cattle
at
dusk
and
on
being
assured
that
no
officers
had
followed
us
resumed
his
place
with
the
herd
he
had
not
even
reached
the
solomon
river
but
had
stopped
with
a
herd
of
millet
on
big
boggy
this
creek
he
reported
as
bottomless
and
the
millet
herd
as
having
lost
between
forty
and
fifty
head
of
cattle
in
attempting
to
force
it
at
the
regular
crossing
the
day
before
his
arrival
they
had
scouted
the
creek
both
up
and
down
since
without
finding
a
safe
crossing
it
seemed
that
there
had
been
unusually
heavy
june
rains
through
that
section
which
accounted
for
boggy
being
in
its
dangerous
condition
millet
foreman
had
not
considered
it
necessary
to
test
such
an
insignificant
stream
until
he
got
a
couple
of
hundred
head
of
cattle
floundering
in
the
mire
they
had
saved
the
greater
portion
of
the
mired
cattle
but
quite
a
number
were
trampled
to
death
by
the
others
and
now
the
regular
crossing
was
not
approachable
for
the
stench
of
dead
cattle
flood
knew
the
stream
and
so
did
a
number
of
our
outfit
but
none
of
them
had
any
idea
that
it
could
get
into
such
an
impassable
condition
as
forrest
reported
the
next
morning
flood
started
to
the
east
and
priest
to
the
west
to
look
out
a
crossing
for
we
were
then
within
half
a
day
drive
of
the
creek
big
boggy
paralleled
the
solomon
river
in
our
front
the
two
not
being
more
than
five
miles
apart
the
confluence
was
far
below
in
some
settlements
and
we
must
keep
to
the
westward
of
all
immigration
on
account
of
the
growing
crops
in
the
fertile
valley
of
the
solomon
on
the
westward
had
a
favorable
crossing
been
found
we
would
almost
have
had
to
turn
our
herd
backward
for
we
were
already
within
the
half
circle
which
this
creek
described
in
our
front
so
after
the
two
men
left
us
we
allowed
the
herd
to
graze
forward
keeping
several
miles
to
the
westward
of
the
trail
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
best
grazing
our
herd
when
left
to
itself
would
graze
from
a
mile
to
a
mile
and
a
half
an
hour
and
by
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
the
timber
on
big
boggy
and
the
solomon
beyond
was
sighted
on
reaching
this
last
divide
some
one
sighted
a
herd
about
five
or
six
miles
to
the
eastward
and
nearly
parallel
with
us
as
they
were
three
or
four
miles
beyond
the
trail
we
could
easily
see
that
they
were
grazing
along
like
ourselves
and
forrest
was
appealed
to
to
know
if
it
was
the
millet
herd
he
said
not
and
pointed
out
to
the
northeast
about
the
location
of
the
millet
cattle
probably
five
miles
in
advance
of
the
stranger
on
our
right
when
we
overtook
our
wagon
at
noon
mccann
who
had
never
left
the
trail
reported
having
seen
the
herd
they
looked
to
him
like
heavy
beef
cattle
and
had
two
yoke
of
oxen
to
their
chuck
wagon
which
served
further
to
proclaim
them
as
strangers
neither
priest
nor
flood
returned
during
the
noon
hour
and
when
the
herd
refused
to
lie
down
and
rest
longer
we
grazed
them
forward
till
the
fringe
of
timber
which
grew
along
the
stream
loomed
up
not
a
mile
distant
in
our
front
from
the
course
we
were
traveling
we
would
strike
the
creek
several
miles
above
the
regular
crossing
and
as
forrest
reported
that
millet
was
holding
below
the
old
crossing
on
a
small
rivulet
all
we
could
do
was
to
hold
our
wagon
in
the
rear
and
await
the
return
of
our
men
out
on
scout
for
a
ford
priest
was
the
first
to
return
with
word
that
he
had
ridden
the
creek
out
for
miles
and
had
found
no
crossing
that
would
be
safe
for
a
mud
turtle
on
hearing
this
we
left
two
men
with
the
herd
and
the
rest
of
the
outfit
took
the
wagon
went
on
to
boggy
and
made
camp
it
was
a
stream
not
over
fifty
or
sixty
feet
wide
in
places
the
current
barely
moved
shallowing
and
deepening
from
a
few
inches
in
places
to
several
feet
in
others
with
an
occasional
pool
that
would
swim
a
horse
we
probed
it
with
poles
until
we
were
satisfied
that
we
were
up
against
a
proposition
different
from
anything
we
had
yet
encountered
while
we
were
discussing
the
situation
a
stranger
rode
up
on
a
fine
roan
horse
and
inquired
for
our
foreman
forrest
informed
him
that
our
boss
was
away
looking
for
a
crossing
but
we
were
expecting
his
return
at
any
time
and
invited
the
stranger
to
dismount
he
did
so
and
threw
himself
down
in
the
shade
of
our
wagon
he
was
a
small
fellow
of
sandy
complexion
not
much
if
any
over
twenty
years
old
and
smiled
continuously
my
name
is
pete
slaughter
said
he
by
way
of
introduction
and
i
got
a
herd
of
hundred
beef
steers
beyond
the
trail
and
a
few
miles
back
i
been
riding
since
daybreak
down
the
creek
and
i
prepared
to
state
that
the
chance
of
crossing
is
as
good
right
here
as
anywhere
i
wanted
to
see
your
foreman
and
if
he
help
we
bridge
her
i
been
down
to
see
this
other
outfit
but
they
ridicule
the
idea
though
i
think
they
come
around
all
right
i
borrowed
their
axe
and
morning
you
see
me
with
my
outfit
cutting
timber
to
bridge
big
boggy
that
right
boys
it
the
only
thing
to
do
the
trouble
is
i
only
got
eight
men
all
told
i
aim
to
travel
over
eight
or
ten
miles
a
day
so
i
do
need
a
big
outfit
you
say
your
foreman
name
is
flood
well
if
he
do
return
before
i
go
some
of
you
tell
him
that
he
wasting
good
time
looking
for
a
ford
for
there
ai
none
in
the
conversation
which
followed
we
learned
that
slaughter
was
driving
for
his
brother
lum
a
widely
known
cowman
and
drover
whom
we
had
seen
in
dodge
he
had
started
with
the
grass
from
north
texas
and
by
the
time
he
reached
the
platte
many
of
his
herd
would
be
fit
to
ship
to
market
and
what
were
not
would
be
in
good
demand
as
feeders
in
the
corn
belt
of
eastern
nebraska
he
asked
if
we
had
seen
his
herd
during
the
morning
and
on
hearing
we
had
got
up
and
asked
mccann
to
let
him
see
our
axe
this
he
gave
a
critical
examination
before
he
mounted
his
horse
to
go
and
on
leaving
said
if
your
foreman
do
want
to
help
build
a
bridge
i
want
to
borrow
that
axe
of
yours
but
you
fellows
talk
to
him
if
any
of
you
boys
has
ever
been
over
on
the
chisholm
trail
you
will
remember
the
bridge
on
rush
creek
south
of
the
washita
river
i
built
that
bridge
in
a
day
with
an
outfit
of
ten
men
why
shucks
if
these
outfits
would
pull
together
we
could
cross
evening
lots
of
these
old
foremen
do
like
to
listen
to
a
cub
like
me
but
holy
snakes
i
been
over
the
trail
oftener
than
any
of
them
why
when
i
was
big
enough
to
make
a
hand
with
the
herd
only
ten
years
old
in
the
days
when
we
drove
to
abilene
they
used
to
send
me
in
the
lead
with
an
old
cylinder
gun
to
shoot
at
the
buffalo
and
scare
them
off
the
trail
and
i
made
the
trip
every
year
since
so
you
tell
flood
when
he
comes
in
that
pete
slaughter
was
here
and
that
he
going
to
build
a
bridge
and
would
like
to
have
him
and
his
outfit
help
had
it
not
been
for
his
youth
and
perpetual
smile
we
might
have
taken
young
slaughter
more
seriously
for
both
quince
forrest
and
the
rebel
remembered
the
bridge
on
rush
creek
over
on
the
chisholm
still
there
was
an
air
of
confident
assurance
in
the
young
fellow
and
the
fact
that
he
was
the
trusted
foreman
of
lum
slaughter
in
charge
of
a
valuable
herd
of
cattle
carried
weight
with
those
who
knew
that
drover
the
most
unwelcome
thought
in
the
project
was
that
it
required
the
swinging
of
an
axe
to
fell
trees
and
to
cut
them
into
the
necessary
lengths
and
as
i
have
said
before
the
texan
never
took
kindly
to
manual
labor
but
priest
looked
favorably
on
the
suggestion
and
so
enlisted
my
support
and
even
pointed
out
a
spot
where
timber
was
most
abundant
as
a
suitable
place
to
build
the
bridge
hell
fire
said
joe
stallings
with
infinite
contempt
thousands
of
places
to
build
a
bridge
and
the
timber
there
but
the
idea
is
to
cut
it
and
his
sentiments
found
a
hearty
approval
in
the
majority
of
the
outfit
flood
returned
late
that
evening
having
ridden
as
far
down
the
creek
as
the
first
settlement
the
rebel
somewhat
antagonized
by
the
attitude
of
the
majority
reported
the
visit
and
message
left
for
him
by
young
slaughter
our
foreman
knew
him
by
general
reputation
amongst
trail
bosses
and
when
priest
vouched
for
him
as
the
builder
of
the
rush
creek
bridge
on
the
chisholm
trail
flood
said
why
i
crossed
my
herd
four
years
ago
on
that
rush
creek
bridge
within
a
week
after
it
was
built
and
wondered
who
it
could
be
that
had
the
nerve
to
undertake
that
task
rush
is
over
half
as
wide
a
bayou
as
boggy
but
she
a
true
little
sister
to
this
miry
slough
so
he
going
to
build
a
bridge
anyhow
is
he
the
next
morning
young
slaughter
was
at
our
camp
before
sunrise
and
never
once
mentioning
his
business
or
waiting
for
the
formality
of
an
invitation
proceeded
to
pour
out
a
tin
cup
of
coffee
and
otherwise
provide
himself
with
a
substantial
breakfast
there
was
something
amusing
in
the
audacity
of
the
fellow
which
all
of
us
liked
though
he
was
fifteen
years
the
junior
of
our
foreman
mccann
pointed
out
flood
to
him
and
taking
his
plate
he
went
over
and
sat
down
by
our
foreman
and
while
he
ate
talked
rapidly
to
enlist
our
outfit
in
the
building
of
the
bridge
during
breakfast
the
outfit
listened
to
the
two
bosses
as
they
discussed
the
feasibility
of
the
project
slaughter
enthusiastic
flood
reserved
and
asking
all
sorts
of
questions
as
to
the
mode
of
procedure
young
pete
met
every
question
with
promptness
and
assured
our
foreman
that
the
building
of
bridges
was
his
long
suit
after
breakfast
the
two
foremen
rode
off
down
the
creek
together
and
within
half
an
hour
slaughter
wagon
and
pulled
up
within
sight
of
the
regular
crossing
and
shortly
afterwards
our
foreman
returned
and
ordered
our
wagon
to
pull
down
to
a
clump
of
cotton
woods
which
grew
about
half
a
mile
below
our
camp
two
men
were
detailed
to
look
after
our
herd
during
the
day
and
the
remainder
of
us
returned
with
our
foreman
to
the
site
selected
for
the
bridge
on
our
arrival
three
axes
were
swinging
against
as
many
cottonwoods
and
there
was
no
doubt
in
any
one
mind
that
we
were
going
to
be
under
a
new
foreman
for
that
day
at
least
slaughter
had
a
big
negro
cook
who
swung
an
axe
in
a
manner
which
bespoke
him
a
job
for
the
day
and
mccann
was
instructed
to
provide
dinner
for
the
extra
outfit
the
site
chosen
for
the
bridge
was
a
miry
bottom
over
which
oozed
three
or
four
inches
of
water
where
the
width
of
the
stream
was
about
sixty
feet
with
solid
banks
on
either
side
to
get
a
good
foundation
was
the
most
important
matter
but
the
brush
from
the
trees
would
supply
the
material
for
that
and
within
an
hour
brush
began
to
arrive
dragged
from
the
pommels
of
saddles
and
was
piled
into
the
stream
about
this
time
a
call
went
out
for
a
volunteer
who
could
drive
oxen
for
the
darky
was
too
good
an
axeman
to
be
recalled
as
i
had
driven
oxen
as
a
boy
i
was
going
to
offer
my
services
when
joe
stallings
eagerly
volunteered
in
order
to
avoid
using
an
axe
slaughter
had
some
extra
chain
and
our
four
mules
were
pressed
into
service
as
an
extra
team
in
snaking
logs
as
mccann
was
to
provide
for
the
inner
man
the
mule
team
fell
to
me
and
putting
my
saddle
on
the
nigh
wheeler
i
rode
jauntily
past
stallings
as
he
trudged
alongside
his
two
yoke
of
oxen
about
ten
in
the
morning
george
jacklin
the
foreman
of
the
millet
herd
rode
up
with
several
of
his
men
and
seeing
the
bridge
taking
shape
turned
in
and
assisted
in
dragging
brush
for
the
foundation
by
the
time
all
hands
knocked
off
for
dinner
we
had
a
foundation
of
brush
twenty
feet
wide
and
four
feet
high
to
say
nothing
about
what
had
sunk
in
the
mire
the
logs
were
cut
about
fourteen
feet
long
and
old
joe
and
i
had
snaked
them
up
as
fast
as
the
axemen
could
get
them
ready
jacklin
returned
to
his
wagon
for
dinner
and
a
change
of
horses
though
slaughter
with
plenty
of
assurance
had
invited
him
to
eat
with
us
and
when
he
declined
had
remarked
with
no
less
confidence
well
then
you
be
back
right
after
dinner
and
say
bring
all
the
men
you
can
spare
and
if
got
any
gunny
sacks
or
old
tarpaulins
bring
them
and
by
all
means
do
forget
your
spade
pete
slaughter
was
a
harsh
master
considering
he
was
working
volunteer
labor
but
then
we
all
felt
a
common
interest
in
the
bridge
for
if
slaughter
beeves
could
cross
ours
could
and
so
could
millet
all
the
men
dragging
brush
changed
horses
during
dinner
for
there
was
to
be
no
pause
in
piling
in
a
good
foundation
as
long
as
the
material
was
at
hand
jacklin
and
his
outfit
returned
ten
strong
and
with
thirty
men
at
work
the
bridge
grew
they
began
laying
the
logs
on
the
brush
after
dinner
and
the
work
of
sodding
the
bridge
went
forward
at
the
same
time
the
bridge
stood
about
two
feet
above
the
water
in
the
creek
but
when
near
the
middle
of
the
stream
was
reached
the
foundation
gave
way
and
for
an
hour
ten
horses
were
kept
busy
dragging
brush
to
fill
that
sink
hole
until
it
would
bear
the
weight
of
the
logs
we
had
used
all
the
acceptable
timber
on
our
side
of
the
stream
for
half
a
mile
either
way
and
yet
there
were
not
enough
logs
to
complete
the
bridge
when
we
lacked
only
some
ten
or
twelve
logs
slaughter
had
the
boys
sod
a
narrow
strip
across
the
remaining
brush
and
the
horsemen
led
their
mounts
across
to
the
farther
side
then
the
axemen
crossed
felled
the
nearest
trees
and
the
last
logs
were
dragged
up
from
the
pommels
of
our
saddles
it
now
only
remained
to
sod
over
and
dirt
the
bridge
thoroughly
with
only
three
spades
the
work
was
slow
but
we
cut
sod
with
axes
and
after
several
hours
work
had
it
finished
the
two
yoke
of
oxen
were
driven
across
and
back
for
a
test
and
the
bridge
stood
it
nobly
slaughter
then
brought
up
his
and
while
the
work
of
dirting
the
bridge
was
still
going
on
crossed
and
recrossed
his
band
of
saddle
horses
twenty
times
when
the
bridge
looked
completed
to
every
one
else
young
pete
advised
laying
stringers
across
on
either
side
so
a
number
of
small
trees
were
felled
and
guard
rails
strung
across
the
ends
of
the
logs
and
staked
then
more
dirt
was
carried
in
on
tarpaulins
and
in
gunny
sacks
and
every
chink
and
crevice
filled
with
sod
and
dirt
it
was
now
getting
rather
late
in
the
afternoon
but
during
the
finishing
touches
young
slaughter
had
dispatched
his
outfit
to
bring
up
his
herd
and
at
the
same
time
flood
had
sent
a
number
of
our
outfit
to
bring
up
our
cattle
now
slaughter
and
the
rest
of
us
took
the
oxen
which
we
had
unyoked
and
went
out
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
meet
his
herd
coming
up
turning
the
oxen
in
the
lead
young
pete
took
one
point
and
flood
the
other
and
pointed
in
the
lead
cattle
for
the
bridge
on
reaching
it
the
cattle
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
it
looked
as
though
they
were
going
to
balk
but
finally
one
of
the
oxen
took
the
lead
and
they
began
to
cross
in
almost
indian
file
they
were
big
four
and
five
year
old
beeves
and
too
many
of
them
on
the
bridge
at
one
time
might
have
sunk
it
but
slaughter
rode
back
down
the
line
of
cattle
and
called
to
the
men
to
hold
them
back
do
crowd
the
cattle
he
shouted
give
them
all
the
time
they
want
we
in
no
hurry
now
there
lots
of
time
they
were
a
full
half
hour
in
crossing
the
chain
of
cattle
taking
the
bridge
never
for
a
moment
being
broken
once
all
were
over
his
men
rode
to
the
lead
and
turned
the
herd
up
boggy
in
order
to
have
it
well
out
of
the
way
of
ours
which
were
then
looming
up
in
sight
slaughter
asked
flood
if
he
wanted
the
oxen
and
as
our
cattle
had
never
seen
a
bridge
in
their
lives
the
foreman
decided
to
use
them
so
we
brought
them
back
and
met
the
herd
now
strung
out
nearly
a
mile
our
cattle
were
naturally
wild
but
we
turned
the
oxen
in
the
lead
and
the
two
bosses
again
taking
the
points
moved
the
herd
up
to
the
bridge
the
oxen
were
again
slow
to
lead
out
in
crossing
and
several
hundred
head
of
cattle
had
congested
in
front
of
the
new
bridge
making
us
all
rather
nervous
when
a
big
white
ox
led
off
his
mate
following
and
the
herd
began
timidly
to
follow
our
cattle
required
careful
handling
and
not
a
word
was
spoken
as
we
nursed
them
forward
or
rode
through
them
to
scatter
large
bunches
a
number
of
times
we
cut
the
train
of
cattle
off
entirely
as
they
were
congesting
at
the
bridge
entrance
and
in
crossing
shied
and
crowded
so
that
several
were
forced
off
the
bridge
into
the
mire
our
herd
crossed
in
considerably
less
time
than
did
slaughter
beeves
but
we
had
five
head
to
pull
out
this
however
was
considered
nothing
as
they
were
light
and
the
mire
was
as
thin
as
soup
our
wagon
and
saddle
horses
crossed
while
we
were
pulling
out
the
bogged
cattle
and
about
half
the
outfit
taking
the
herd
drifted
them
forward
towards
the
solomon
since
millet
intended
crossing
that
evening
herds
were
likely
to
be
too
thick
for
safety
at
night
the
sun
was
hardly
an
hour
high
when
the
last
herd
came
up
to
cross
the
oxen
were
put
in
the
lead
as
with
ours
and
all
four
of
the
oxen
took
the
bridge
but
when
the
cattle
reached
the
bridge
they
made
a
decided
balk
and
refused
to
follow
the
oxen
not
a
hoof
of
the
herd
would
even
set
foot
on
the
bridge
the
oxen
were
brought
back
several
times
but
in
spite
of
all
coaxing
and
nursing
and
our
best
endeavors
and
devices
they
would
not
risk
it
we
worked
with
them
until
dusk
when
all
three
of
the
foremen
decided
it
was
useless
to
try
longer
but
both
slaughter
and
flood
promised
to
bring
back
part
of
their
outfits
in
the
morning
and
make
another
effort
mccann
piloted
us
to
our
wagon
at
least
three
miles
from
the
bridge
for
he
had
laid
in
a
good
supply
of
wood
during
the
day
and
on
our
arrival
our
night
horses
were
tied
up
and
everything
made
ready
for
the
night
the
next
morning
we
started
the
herd
but
flood
took
four
of
us
with
him
and
went
back
to
big
boggy
the
millet
herd
was
nearly
two
miles
back
from
the
bridge
where
we
found
slaughter
at
jacklin
wagon
and
several
more
of
his
men
were
we
learned
coming
over
with
the
oxen
at
about
ten
that
hour
was
considered
soon
enough
by
the
bosses
as
the
heat
of
the
day
would
be
on
the
herd
by
that
time
which
would
make
them
lazy
when
the
oxen
arrived
at
the
bridge
we
rode
out
twenty
strong
and
lined
the
cattle
up
for
another
trial
they
had
grazed
until
they
were
full
and
sleepy
but
the
memory
of
some
of
them
was
too
vivid
of
the
hours
they
had
spent
in
the
slimy
ooze
of
big
boggy
once
on
a
time
and
they
began
milling
on
sight
of
the
stream
we
took
them
back
and
brought
them
up
a
second
time
with
the
same
results
we
then
brought
them
around
in
a
circle
a
mile
in
diameter
and
as
the
rear
end
of
the
herd
was
passing
we
turned
the
last
hundred
and
throwing
the
oxen
into
their
lead
started
them
for
the
bridge
but
they
too
sulked
and
would
have
none
of
it
it
was
now
high
noon
so
we
turned
the
herd
and
allowed
them
to
graze
back
while
we
went
to
dinner
millet
foreman
was
rather
discouraged
with
the
outlook
but
slaughter
said
they
must
be
crossed
if
he
had
to
lay
over
a
week
and
help
after
dinner
jacklin
asked
us
if
we
wanted
a
change
of
horses
and
as
we
could
see
a
twenty
mile
ride
ahead
of
us
in
overtaking
our
herd
flood
accepted
when
all
was
ready
to
start
slaughter
made
a
suggestion
let
go
out
he
said
and
bring
them
up
slowly
in
a
solid
body
and
when
we
get
them
opposite
the
bridge
round
them
in
gradually
as
if
we
were
going
to
bed
them
down
i
take
a
long
lariat
to
my
white
wheeler
and
when
they
have
quieted
down
perfectly
i
lead
old
blanco
through
them
and
across
the
bridge
and
possibly
they
follow
there
no
use
crowding
them
for
that
only
excites
them
and
if
you
ever
start
them
milling
the
jig
up
they
nice
gentle
cattle
but
they
been
balked
once
and
they
have
forgotten
it
what
we
needed
right
then
was
a
leader
for
we
were
all
ready
to
catch
at
a
straw
and
slaughter
suggestion
was
welcome
for
he
had
established
himself
in
our
good
graces
until
we
preferred
him
to
either
of
the
other
foremen
as
a
leader
riding
out
to
the
herd
which
were
lying
down
we
roused
and
started
them
back
towards
boggy
while
drifting
them
back
we
covered
a
front
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
width
and
as
we
neared
the
bridge
we
gave
them
perfect
freedom
slaughter
had
caught
out
his
white
ox
and
we
gradually
worked
them
into
a
body
covering
perhaps
ten
acres
in
front
of
the
bridge
several
small
bunches
attempted
to
mill
but
some
of
us
rode
in
and
split
them
up
and
after
about
half
an
hour
wait
they
quieted
down
then
slaughter
rode
in
whistling
and
leading
his
white
ox
at
the
end
of
a
foot
lariat
and
as
he
rode
through
them
they
were
so
logy
that
he
had
to
quirt
them
out
of
the
way
when
he
came
to
the
bridge
he
stopped
the
white
wheeler
until
everything
had
quieted
down
then
he
led
old
blanco
on
again
but
giving
him
all
the
time
he
needed
and
stopping
every
few
feet
we
held
our
breath
as
one
or
two
of
the
herd
started
to
follow
him
but
they
shied
and
turned
back
and
our
hopes
of
the
moment
were
crushed
slaughter
detained
the
ox
on
the
bridge
for
several
minutes
but
seeing
it
was
useless
he
dismounted
and
drove
him
back
into
the
herd
again
and
again
he
tried
the
same
ruse
but
it
was
of
no
avail
then
we
threw
the
herd
back
about
half
a
mile
and
on
flood
suggestion
cut
off
possibly
two
hundred
head
a
bunch
which
with
our
numbers
we
ought
to
handle
readily
in
spite
of
their
will
and
by
putting
their
of
over
a
hundred
saddle
horses
in
the
immediate
lead
made
the
experiment
of
forcing
them
we
took
the
saddle
horses
down
and
crossed
and
recrossed
the
bridge
several
times
with
them
and
as
the
cattle
came
up
turned
the
horses
into
the
lead
and
headed
for
the
bridge
with
a
cordon
of
twenty
riders
around
them
no
animal
could
turn
back
and
the
horses
crossed
the
bridge
on
a
trot
but
the
cattle
turned
tail
and
positively
refused
to
have
anything
to
do
with
it
we
held
them
like
a
block
in
a
vise
so
compactly
that
they
could
not
even
mill
but
they
would
not
cross
the
bridge
when
it
became
evident
that
it
was
a
fruitless
effort
jacklin
usually
a
very
quiet
man
gave
vent
to
a
fit
of
profanity
which
would
have
put
the
army
in
flanders
to
shame
slaughter
somewhat
to
our
amusement
reproved
him
do
fret
man
this
is
nothing
i
balked
a
herd
once
in
crossing
a
railroad
track
and
after
trying
for
two
days
to
cross
them
had
to
drive
ten
miles
and
put
them
under
a
culvert
you
want
to
cultivate
patience
young
fellow
when
handling
dumb
brutes
if
slaughter
darky
cook
had
been
thereabouts
then
and
suggested
a
means
of
getting
that
herd
to
take
the
bridge
his
suggestion
would
have
been
welcomed
for
the
bosses
were
at
their
wits
ends
jacklin
swore
that
he
would
bed
that
herd
at
the
entrance
and
hold
them
there
until
they
starved
to
death
or
crossed
before
he
would
let
an
animal
turn
back
but
cooler
heads
were
present
and
the
rebel
mentioned
a
certain
adage
to
the
effect
that
when
a
bird
or
a
girl
he
know
which
could
sing
and
would
she
or
it
ought
to
be
made
to
sing
he
suggested
that
we
hold
the
four
oxen
on
the
bridge
cut
off
fifteen
head
of
cattle
and
give
them
such
a
running
start
they
would
know
which
end
their
heads
were
on
when
they
reached
the
bridge
millet
foreman
approved
of
the
idea
for
he
was
nursing
his
wrath
the
four
oxen
were
accordingly
cut
out
and
slaughter
and
one
of
his
men
taking
them
started
for
the
bridge
with
instructions
to
hold
them
on
the
middle
the
rest
of
us
took
about
a
dozen
head
of
light
cattle
brought
them
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
bridge
then
with
a
yell
started
them
on
a
run
from
which
they
could
not
turn
back
they
struck
the
entrance
squarely
and
we
had
our
first
cattle
on
the
bridge
two
men
held
the
entrance
and
we
brought
up
another
bunch
in
the
same
manner
which
filled
the
bridge
now
we
thought
if
the
herd
could
be
brought
up
slowly
and
this
bridgeful
let
off
in
their
lead
they
might
follow
to
june
a
herd
of
cattle
across
in
this
manner
would
have
been
shameful
and
the
foreman
of
the
herd
knew
it
as
well
as
any
one
present
but
no
one
protested
so
we
left
men
to
hold
the
entrance
securely
and
went
back
after
the
herd
when
we
got
them
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
creek
we
cut
off
about
two
hundred
head
of
the
leaders
and
brought
them
around
to
the
rear
for
amongst
these
leaders
were
certain
to
be
the
ones
which
had
been
bogged
and
we
wanted
to
have
new
leaders
in
this
trial
slaughter
was
on
the
farther
end
of
the
bridge
and
could
be
depended
on
to
let
the
oxen
lead
off
at
the
opportune
moment
we
brought
them
up
cautiously
and
when
the
herd
came
within
a
few
rods
of
the
creek
the
cattle
on
the
bridge
lowed
to
their
mates
in
the
herd
and
slaughter
considering
the
time
favorable
opened
out
and
allowed
them
to
leave
the
bridge
on
the
farther
side
as
soon
as
the
cattle
started
leaving
on
the
farther
side
we
dropped
back
and
the
leaders
of
the
herd
to
the
number
of
a
dozen
after
smelling
the
fresh
dirt
and
seeing
the
others
crossing
walked
cautiously
up
on
the
bridge
it
was
a
moment
of
extreme
anxiety
none
of
us
spoke
a
word
but
the
cattle
crowding
off
the
bridge
at
the
farther
end
set
it
vibrating
that
was
enough
they
turned
as
if
and
rushed
back
to
the
body
of
the
herd
i
was
almost
afraid
to
look
at
jacklin
he
could
scarcely
speak
but
he
rode
over
to
me
ashen
with
rage
and
kept
repeating
well
that
beat
hell
slaughter
rode
back
across
the
bridge
and
the
men
came
up
and
gathered
around
jacklin
we
seemed
to
have
run
the
full
length
of
our
rope
no
one
even
had
a
suggestion
to
offer
and
if
any
one
had
had
it
needed
to
be
a
plausible
one
to
find
approval
for
hope
seemed
to
have
vanished
while
discussing
the
situation
a
fellow
belonging
to
slaughter
outfit
galloped
up
from
the
rear
and
said
almost
breathlessly
say
fellows
i
see
a
cow
and
calf
in
the
herd
let
rope
the
calf
and
the
cow
is
sure
to
follow
get
the
rope
around
the
calf
neck
and
when
it
chokes
him
he
liable
to
bellow
and
that
will
call
the
steers
and
if
you
never
let
up
on
the
choking
till
you
get
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
i
think
it
work
let
try
it
anyhow
we
all
approved
for
we
knew
that
next
to
the
smell
of
blood
nothing
will
stir
range
cattle
like
the
bellowing
of
a
calf
at
the
mere
suggestion
jacklin
men
scattered
into
the
herd
and
within
a
few
minutes
we
had
a
rope
round
the
neck
of
the
calf
as
the
roper
came
through
the
herd
leading
the
calf
the
frantic
mother
followed
with
a
train
of
excited
steers
at
her
heels
and
as
the
calf
was
dragged
bellowing
across
the
bridge
it
was
followed
by
excited
struggling
steers
who
never
knew
whether
they
were
walking
on
a
bridge
or
on
the
excitement
spread
through
the
herd
and
they
thickened
around
the
entrance
until
it
was
necessary
to
hold
them
back
and
only
let
enough
pass
to
keep
the
chain
unbroken
they
were
nearly
a
half
hour
in
crossing
for
it
was
fully
as
large
a
herd
as
ours
and
when
the
last
animal
had
crossed
pete
slaughter
stood
up
in
his
stirrups
and
led
the
long
yell
the
sun
went
down
that
day
on
nobody
wrath
for
jacklin
was
so
tickled
that
he
offered
to
kill
the
fattest
beef
in
his
herd
if
we
would
stay
overnight
with
him
all
three
of
the
herds
were
now
over
but
had
not
this
herd
balked
on
us
the
evening
before
over
nine
thousand
cattle
would
have
crossed
slaughter
bridge
the
day
it
was
built
it
was
now
late
in
the
evening
and
as
we
had
to
wait
some
little
time
to
get
our
own
horses
we
stayed
for
supper
it
was
dark
before
we
set
out
to
overtake
the
herd
but
the
trail
was
plain
and
letting
our
horses
take
their
own
time
we
jollied
along
until
after
midnight
we
might
have
missed
the
camp
but
by
the
merest
chance
priest
sighted
our
a
mile
off
the
trail
though
it
had
burned
to
embers
on
reaching
camp
we
changed
saddles
to
our
night
horses
and
calling
officer
were
ready
for
our
watch
we
were
expecting
the
men
on
guard
to
call
us
any
minute
and
while
priest
was
explaining
to
officer
the
trouble
we
had
had
in
crossing
the
millet
herd
i
dozed
off
to
sleep
there
as
i
sat
by
the
rekindled
embers
in
that
minute
sleep
my
mind
wandered
in
a
dream
to
my
home
on
the
san
antonio
river
but
the
next
moment
i
was
aroused
to
the
demands
of
the
hour
by
the
rebel
shaking
me
and
saying
wake
up
tom
and
take
a
new
hold
they
calling
us
on
guard
if
you
expect
to
follow
the
trail
son
you
must
learn
to
do
your
sleeping
in
the

chapter
xv
the
beaver
after
leaving
the
country
tributary
to
the
solomon
river
we
crossed
a
wide
tableland
for
nearly
a
hundred
miles
and
with
the
exception
of
the
kansas
pacific
railroad
without
a
landmark
worthy
of
a
name
western
kansas
was
then
classified
worthily
too
as
belonging
to
the
great
american
desert
and
most
of
the
country
for
the
last
five
hundred
miles
of
our
course
was
entitled
to
a
similar
description
once
the
freshness
of
spring
had
passed
the
plain
took
on
her
natural
sunburnt
color
and
day
after
day
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
the
monotony
was
unbroken
save
by
the
variations
of
the
mirages
on
every
hand
except
at
morning
and
evening
we
were
never
out
of
sight
of
these
optical
illusions
sometimes
miles
away
and
then
again
close
up
when
an
antelope
standing
half
a
mile
distant
looked
as
tall
as
a
giraffe
frequently
the
lead
of
the
herd
would
be
in
eclipse
from
these
illusions
when
to
the
men
in
the
rear
the
horsemen
and
cattle
in
the
lead
would
appear
like
giants
in
an
old
fairy
story
if
the
monotony
of
the
sea
can
be
charged
with
dulling
men
sensibilities
until
they
become
pirates
surely
this
desolate
arid
plain
might
be
equally
charged
with
the
wrongdoing
of
not
a
few
of
our
craft
on
crossing
the
railroad
at
grinnell
our
foreman
received
a
letter
from
lovell
directing
him
to
go
to
culbertson
nebraska
and
there
meet
a
man
who
was
buying
horses
for
a
montana
ranch
our
employer
had
his
business
eye
open
for
a
possible
purchaser
for
our
and
if
the
horses
could
be
sold
for
delivery
after
the
herd
had
reached
its
destination
the
opportunity
was
not
to
be
overlooked
accordingly
on
reaching
beaver
creek
where
we
encamped
flood
left
us
to
ride
through
to
the
republican
river
during
the
night
the
trail
crossed
this
river
about
twenty
miles
west
of
culbertson
and
if
the
montana
horse
buyer
were
yet
there
it
would
be
no
trouble
to
come
up
to
the
trail
crossing
and
look
at
our
horses
so
after
supper
and
while
we
were
catching
up
our
night
horses
flood
said
to
us
now
boys
i
going
to
leave
the
outfit
and
herd
under
joe
stallings
as
it
hardly
necessary
to
leave
you
under
any
one
as
foreman
for
you
all
know
your
places
but
some
one
must
be
made
responsible
and
one
bad
boss
will
do
less
harm
than
half
a
dozen
that
might
agree
so
you
can
put
honeyman
on
guard
in
your
place
at
night
joe
if
you
do
want
to
stand
your
own
watch
now
behave
yourselves
and
when
i
meet
you
on
the
republican
i
bring
out
a
box
of
cigars
and
have
it
charged
up
as
axle
grease
when

that
what
i
call
a
good
cow

said
joe
stallings
as
our
foreman
rode
away
in
the
twilight
besides
he
used
passable
good
judgment
in
selecting
a
now
honeyman

and
harness

mules
before

morning
i
want
to
impress

on
your
mind
mccann
that
i
can
appreciate

thoughtful
cook

honeyman

night
horse
love

love
my
dog
my
horse
shares
this
snap
now
i
do
want
to
be
under
the
necessity
of
speaking
to
any
of
you
first
guard
but
flop
into
your
saddles
ready
to
take
the
herd
my
turnip
says

eight
now
why
you
missed
your
calling
you
make
a
fine
second
mate
on
a
river
steamboat
driving
niggers
called
back
quince
forrest
as
the
first
guard
rode
away
when
our
guard
returned
officer
intentionally
walked
across
stallings
bed
and
catching
his
spur
in
the
tarpaulin
fell
heavily
across
our
excuse
me
said
john
rising
but
i
was
just
nosing
around
looking
for
the
foreman
oh
it
you
is
it
i
just
wanted
to
ask
if
would
be
plenty
early
to
build
up
the
fire
wood
a
little
scarce
but
i
burn
the
prairies
if
you
say
so
that
all
i
wanted
to
know
you
may
lay
down
now
and
go
to
sleep
our
that
night
was
a
good
one
and
in
the
absence
of
flood
no
one
felt
like
going
to
bed
until
drowsiness
compelled
us
so
we
lounged
around
the
fire
smoking
the
hours
away
and
in
spite
of
the
admonition
of
our
foreman
told
stories
far
into
the
night
during
the
early
portion
of
the
evening
dog
stories
occupied
the
boards
as
the
evening
wore
on
the
subject
of
revisiting
the
old
states
came
up
for
discussion
you
all
talk
about
going
back
to
the
old
states
said
joe
stallings
but
i
do
take
very
friendly
to
the
idea
i
felt
that
way
once
and
went
home
to
tennessee
but
i
want
to
tell
you
that
after
you
live
a
few
years
in
the
sunny
southwest
and
get
onto
her
ways
you
stand
it
back
there
like
you
think
you
can
now
when
i
went
back
and
i
reckon
my
relations
will
average
up
pretty
well
fought
in
the
confederate
army
vote
the
democratic
ticket
and
belong
to
the
methodist
church
they
all
seemed
to
be
rapidly
getting
locoed
why
my
uncles
when
they
think
of
planting
the
old
buck
field
or
the
widow
acre
into
any
crop
they
first
go
projecting
around
in
the
soil
and
as
they
say
analyze
it
to
see
what
kind
of
a
fertilizer
it
will
require
to
produce
the
best
results
back
there
if
one
man
raises
ten
acres
of
corn
and
his
neighbor
raises
twelve
the
one
raising
twelve
is
sure
to
look
upon
the
other
as
though
he
lacked
enterprise
or
had
modest
ambitions
now
up
around
that
old
cow
town
abilene
kansas
it
a
common
sight
to
see
the
cornfields
stretch
out
like
an
ocean
and
then
their
stock
they
are
all
locoed
about
that
why
i
know
people
who
will
pay
a
hundred
dollars
for
siring
a
colt
and
if
there
one
drop
of
mongrel
blood
in
that
sire
veins
for
ten
generations
back
on
either
side
of
his
ancestral
tree
it
condemns
him
though
he
may
be
a
good
horse
otherwise
they
are
strong
on
standard
bred
horses
but
as
for
me
my
mount
is
all
right
i
trade
with
any
man
in
this
outfit
without
it
would
be
flood
and
there
none
of
them
standard
bred
either
why
shucks
if
you
had
the
pick
of
all
the
standard
bred
horses
in
tennessee
you
could
handle
a
herd
of
cattle
like
ours
with
them
without
carrying
a
commissary
with
you
to
feed
them
no
they
would
never
fit
here
it
takes
a
horse
to
run
cattle
one
that
can
rustle
and
live
on
grass
illustration
story
telling
another
thing
about
those
people
back
in
those
old
states
not
one
in
ten
i
gamble
knows
the
teacher
he
sends
his
children
to
school
to
but
when
he
has
a
promising
colt
to
be
shod
the
owner
goes
to
the
blacksmith
shop
himself
and
he
and
the
smith
will
sit
on
the
back
sill
of
the
shop
and
they
will
discuss
how
to
shoe
that
filly
so
as
to
give
her
certain
knee
action
which
she
seems
to
need
probably
says
one
a
little
weight
on
her
toe
would
give
her
reach
and
there
they
will
sit
and
powwow
and
make
medicine
for
an
hour
or
two
and
while
the
blacksmith
is
shoeing
her
the
owner
will
tell
him
in
confidence
what
a
wonderful
burst
of
speed
she
developed
yesterday
while
he
was
speeding
her
on
the
back
stretch
and
then
just
as
he
turned
her
into
the
home
stretch
she
threw
a
shoe
and
he
had
to
check
her
in
but
if
there
been
any
one
to
catch
her
time
he
was
certain
it
was
better
than
a
clip
and
that
same
colt
you
cut
a
lame
cow
out
of
the
shade
of
a
tree
on
her
a
man
back
there
he
rich
too
though
his
father
made
it
gave
a
thousand
dollars
for
a
pair
of
dogs
before
they
were
born
the
terms
were
one
half
cash
and
the
balance
when
they
were
old
enough
to
ship
to
him
and
for
fear
they
were
not
the
proper
mustard
he
had
that
dog
man
sue
him
in
court
for
the
balance
so
as
to
make
him
prove
the
pedigree
now
bob
there
thinks
that
old
hound
of
his
is
the
real
stuff
but
he
would
do
now
almost
every
year
the
style
changes
in
dogs
back
in
the
old
states
one
year
maybe
it
a
little
white
dog
with
red
eyes
and
the
very
next
it
a
long
black
dog
with
a
dutch
name
that
right
now
i
disremember
common
old
pot
hounds
and
everyday
yellow
dogs
have
gone
out
of
style
entirely
no
you
can
all
go
back
that
want
to
but
as
long
as
i
can
hold
a
job
with
lovell
and
flood
i
try
and
worry
along
in
my
own
way
on
finishing
his
little
yarn
stallings
arose
saying
i
must
take
a
listen
to
my
men
on
herd
it
always
frets
me
for
fear
my
men
will
ride
too
near
the
cattle
a
minute
later
he
called
us
and
when
several
of
us
walked
out
to
where
he
was
listening
we
recognized
roundtree
voice
singing
little
black
bull
came
down
the
hillside
down
the
hillside
down
the
hillside
little
black
bull
came
down
the
hillside
long
time
ago
whenever
my
men
sing
that
song
on
guard
it
tells
me
that
everything
is
amply
serene
remarked
our
with
the
air
of
a
as
we
walked
back
to
the
fire
the
evening
had
passed
so
rapidly
it
was
now
almost
time
for
the
second
guard
to
be
called
and
when
the
lateness
of
the
hour
was
announced
we
skurried
to
our
blankets
like
rabbits
to
their
warrens
the
second
guard
usually
got
an
hour
or
two
of
sleep
before
being
called
but
in
the
absence
of
our
regular
foreman
the
mice
would
play
when
our
guard
was
called
at
one
as
usual
officer
delayed
us
several
minutes
looking
for
his
spurs
and
i
took
the
chance
to
ask
the
rebel
why
it
was
that
he
never
wore
spurs
it
because
i
superstitious
son
he
answered
i
own
a
fine
pair
of
spurs
that
have
a
history
and
if
you
ever
at
lovell
ranch
i
show
them
to
you
they
were
given
to
me
by
a
mortally
wounded
federal
officer
the
day
the
battle
of
lookout
mountain
was
fought
i
was
an
orderly
carrying
dispatches
and
in
passing
through
a
wood
from
which
the
union
army
had
been
recently
driven
this
officer
was
sitting
at
the
root
of
a
tree
fatally
wounded
he
motioned
me
to
him
and
when
i
dismounted
he
said
reb
please
give
a
dying
man
a
drink
i
gave
him
my
canteen
and
after
drinking
from
it
he
continued
want
you
to
have
my
spurs
take
them
off
listen
to
their
history
as
you
have
taken
them
off
me
so
i
took
them
off
a
mexican
general
the
day
the
american
army
entered
the
capital
of
mexico
chapter
xvi
the
republican
the
outfit
were
awakened
out
of
sleep
the
next
morning
by
shouts
of
whoa
whoa
you
mongrel
outcasts
catch
them
blankety
blank
mules
accompanied
by
a
rattle
of
chain
harness
and
quince
forrest
dashed
across
our
bed
shaking
a
harness
in
each
hand
we
kicked
the
blankets
off
and
came
to
our
feet
in
time
to
see
the
offender
disappear
behind
the
wagon
while
stallings
sat
up
and
yawningly
inquired
what
other
locoed
fool
had
got
funny
but
the
camp
was
awake
for
the
cattle
were
leisurely
leaving
the
bed
ground
while
honeyman
who
had
been
excused
from
the
herd
with
the
first
sign
of
dawn
was
rustling
up
the
horses
in
the
valley
of
the
beaver
below
camp
with
the
understanding
that
the
republican
river
was
a
short
three
days
drive
from
our
present
camp
the
herd
trailed
out
the
first
day
with
not
an
incident
to
break
the
monotony
of
eating
and
sleeping
grazing
and
guarding
but
near
noon
of
the
second
day
we
were
overtaken
by
an
old
man
and
a
boy
of
possibly
fifteen
they
were
riding
in
a
light
rickety
vehicle
drawn
by
a
small
spanish
mule
and
a
rough
but
bay
mare
the
strangers
appealed
to
our
sympathy
for
they
were
guileless
in
appearance
and
asked
so
many
questions
indicating
that
ours
might
have
been
the
first
herd
of
trail
cattle
they
had
ever
seen
the
old
man
was
a
free
talker
and
innocently
allowed
us
to
inveigle
it
out
of
him
that
he
had
been
down
on
the
north
beaver
looking
up
land
to
homestead
and
was
then
on
his
way
up
to
take
a
look
at
the
lands
along
the
republican
we
invited
him
and
the
boy
to
remain
for
dinner
for
in
that
monotonous
waste
we
would
have
been
only
too
glad
to
entertain
a
bandit
or
an
angel
for
that
matter
provided
he
would
talk
about
something
else
than
cattle
in
our
guest
however
we
found
a
good
conversationalist
meaty
with
stories
not
eligible
to
the
retired
list
and
in
return
the
hospitality
of
our
wagon
was
his
and
welcome
the
old
rascal
proved
to
be
a
good
mixer
and
before
dinner
was
over
he
had
won
us
to
a
man
though
stallings
in
the
capacity
of
foreman
felt
it
incumbent
on
him
to
act
the
host
in
behalf
of
the
outfit
in
the
course
of
conversation
the
old
man
managed
to
unearth
the
fact
that
our
acting
foreman
was
a
native
of
tennessee
and
when
he
had
got
it
down
to
town
and
county
claimed
acquaintanceship
with
a
family
of
men
in
that
locality
who
were
famed
as
breeders
of
racehorses
our
guest
admitted
that
he
himself
was
a
native
of
that
state
and
in
his
younger
days
had
been
a
devotee
of
the
racecourse
with
the
name
of
every
horseman
in
that
commonwealth
as
well
as
the
bluegrass
regions
of
kentucky
on
his
tongue
end
but
adversity
had
come
upon
him
and
now
he
was
looking
out
a
new
country
in
which
to
begin
life
over
again
after
dinner
when
our
was
corralled
to
catch
fresh
mounts
our
guest
bubbled
over
with
admiration
of
our
horses
and
pointed
out
several
as
promising
speed
and
action
we
took
his
praise
of
our
horseflesh
as
quite
a
compliment
never
suspecting
flattery
at
the
hands
of
this
nomadic
patriarch
he
innocently
inquired
which
was
considered
the
fastest
horse
in
the
when
stallings
pointed
out
a
brown
belonging
to
flood
mount
as
the
best
quarter
horse
in
the
band
he
gave
him
a
critical
examination
and
confessed
he
would
never
have
picked
him
for
a
horse
possessing
speed
though
he
admitted
that
he
was
unfamiliar
with
horses
this
being
his
first
visit
in
the
west
stallings
offered
to
loan
him
a
horse
out
of
his
mount
and
as
the
old
man
had
no
saddle
our
prevailed
on
mccann
to
loan
his
for
the
afternoon
i
am
inclined
to
think
there
was
a
little
jealousy
amongst
us
that
afternoon
as
to
who
was
best
entitled
to
entertain
our
company
and
while
he
showed
no
partiality
stallings
seemed
to
monopolize
his
countryman
to
our
disadvantage
the
two
jollied
along
from
point
to
rear
and
back
again
and
as
they
passed
us
riders
in
the
swing
stallings
ignored
us
entirely
though
the
old
man
always
had
a
pleasant
word
as
he
rode
by
if
we
do
do
something
to
wean
our
from
that
old
man
said
fox
quarternight
as
he
rode
up
and
overtook
me
he
liable
to
quit
the
herd
and
follow
that
old
fossil
back
to
tennessee
or
some
other
port
just
look
at
the
two
now
will
you
old
joe
putting
on
as
much
dog
as
though
he
was
asking
the
colonel
for
his
daughter
between
me
and
you
and
the
gatepost
quirk
i
a
little
dubious
about
the
old
varmint
he
talks
too
much
but
i
had
warmed
up
to
our
guest
and
gave
fox
criticism
very
little
weight
well
knowing
if
any
one
of
us
had
been
left
in
charge
he
would
have
shown
the
old
man
similar
courtesies
in
this
view
i
was
correct
for
when
stallings
had
ridden
on
ahead
to
look
up
water
that
afternoon
the
very
man
that
entirely
monopolized
our
guest
for
an
hour
was
john
fox
quarternight
nor
did
he
jar
loose
until
we
reached
water
when
stallings
cut
him
off
by
sending
all
the
men
on
the
right
of
the
herd
to
hold
the
cattle
from
grazing
away
until
every
hoof
had
had
ample
time
to
drink
during
this
rest
the
old
man
circulated
around
asking
questions
as
usual
and
when
i
informed
him
that
with
a
half
mile
of
water
front
it
would
take
a
full
hour
to
water
the
herd
properly
he
expressed
an
innocent
amazement
which
seemed
as
simple
as
sincere
when
the
wagon
and
came
up
i
noticed
the
boy
had
tied
his
team
behind
our
wagon
and
was
riding
one
of
honeyman
horses
bareback
assisting
the
wrangler
in
driving
the
saddle
stock
after
the
wagon
had
crossed
the
creek
and
the
kegs
had
been
filled
and
the
teams
watered
stallings
took
the
old
man
with
him
and
the
two
rode
away
in
the
lead
of
the
wagon
and
to
select
a
camp
and
a
bed
ground
for
the
night
the
rest
of
us
grazed
the
cattle
now
thoroughly
watered
forward
until
the
wagon
was
sighted
when
leaving
two
men
as
usual
to
nurse
them
up
to
bed
the
remainder
of
us
struck
out
for
camp
as
i
rode
in
i
sought
out
my
bunkie
to
get
his
opinion
regarding
our
guest
but
the
rebel
was
reticent
as
usual
of
his
opinions
of
people
so
my
inquiries
remained
unanswered
which
only
served
to
increase
my
confidence
in
the
old
man
on
arriving
at
camp
we
found
stallings
and
honeyman
entertaining
our
visitor
in
a
little
game
of
for
a
dollar
a
corner
while
mccann
looked
wistfully
on
as
if
regretting
that
his
culinary
duties
prevented
his
joining
in
our
arrival
should
have
been
the
signal
to
our
wrangler
for
rounding
in
the
for
night
horses
but
stallings
was
too
absorbed
in
the
game
even
to
notice
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
order
in
the
saddle
stock
quarternight
however
had
a
few
dollars
burning
holes
in
his
pocket
and
he
called
our
horse
rustler
attention
to
the
approaching
twilight
not
that
he
was
in
any
hurry
but
if
honeyman
vacated
he
saw
an
opportunity
to
get
into
the
game
the
foreman
gave
the
necessary
order
and
quarternight
at
once
bargained
for
the
wrangler
remaining
beans
and
sat
into
the
game
while
we
were
catching
up
our
night
horses
honeyman
told
us
that
the
old
man
had
been
joking
stallings
about
the
speed
of
brown
even
going
so
far
as
to
intimate
that
he
did
believe
that
the
gelding
could
outrun
that
old
bay
harness
mare
which
he
was
driving
he
had
confessed
that
he
was
too
hard
up
to
wager
much
on
it
but
he
would
risk
a
few
dollars
on
his
judgment
on
a
running
horse
any
day
he
also
said
that
stallings
had
come
back
at
him
more
in
earnest
than
in
jest
that
if
he
really
thought
his
harness
mare
could
outrun
the
brown
he
could
win
every
dollar
the
outfit
had
they
had
codded
one
another
until
joe
had
shown
some
spirit
when
the
old
man
suggested
they
play
a
little
game
of
cards
for
fun
but
stallings
had
insisted
on
stakes
to
make
it
interesting
and
on
the
old
homesteader
pleading
poverty
they
had
agreed
to
make
it
for
a
dollar
on
the
corner
after
supper
our
wanted
to
renew
the
game
the
old
man
protested
that
he
was
too
unlucky
and
could
not
afford
to
lose
but
was
finally
persuaded
to
play
one
more
game
just
to
pass
away
the
evening
well
the
evening
passed
and
within
the
short
space
of
two
hours
there
also
passed
to
the
supposed
lean
purse
of
our
guest
some
twenty
dollars
from
the
feverish
pockets
of
the
outfit
then
the
old
man
felt
too
sleepy
to
play
any
longer
but
loitered
around
some
time
and
casually
inquired
of
his
boy
if
he
had
picketed
their
mare
where
she
would
get
a
good
bait
of
grass
this
naturally
brought
up
the
proposed
race
for
discussion
if
you
really
think
that
that
old
bay
palfrey
of
yours
can
outrun
any
horse
in
our
said
stallings
tauntingly
you
missing
the
chance
of
your
life
not
to
pick
up
a
few
honest
dollars
as
you
journey
along
you
stay
with
us
and
when
we
meet
our
foreman
at
the
republican
if
he
loan
me
the
horse
i
give
you
a
race
for
any
sum
you
name
just
to
show
you
that
i
got
a
few
drops
of
sporting
blood
in
me
and
if
your
mare
can
outrun
a
cow
you
stand
an
easy
chance
to
win
some
money
our
visitor
met
joe
bantering
in
a
timid
manner
before
turning
in
however
he
informed
us
that
he
appreciated
our
hospitality
but
that
he
expected
to
make
an
early
drive
in
the
morning
to
the
republican
where
he
might
camp
several
days
with
this
the
old
man
and
the
boy
unrolled
their
blankets
and
both
were
soon
sound
asleep
then
our
quietly
took
fox
quarternight
off
to
one
side
and
i
heard
the
latter
agree
to
call
him
when
the
third
guard
was
aroused
having
notified
honeyman
that
he
would
stand
his
own
watch
that
night
stallings
with
the
rest
of
the
outfit
soon
joined
the
old
man
in
the
land
of
dreams
instead
of
the
rough
shaking
which
was
customary
on
arousing
a
guard
when
we
of
the
third
watch
were
called
we
were
awakened
in
a
manner
so
cautious
as
to
betoken
something
unusual
in
the
air
the
atmosphere
of
mystery
soon
cleared
after
reaching
the
herd
when
bob
blades
informed
us
that
it
was
the
intention
of
stallings
and
quarternight
to
steal
the
old
man
harness
mare
off
the
picket
rope
and
run
her
against
their
night
horses
in
a
trial
race
like
love
and
war
everything
is
fair
in
horse
racing
but
the
audacity
of
this
proposition
almost
passed
belief
both
blades
and
durham
remained
on
guard
with
us
and
before
we
had
circled
the
herd
half
a
dozen
times
the
two
conspirators
came
riding
up
to
the
bed
ground
leading
the
bay
mare
there
was
a
good
moon
that
night
quarternight
exchanged
mounts
with
john
officer
as
the
latter
had
a
splendid
night
horse
that
had
outstripped
the
outfit
in
every
stampede
so
far
and
our
and
the
second
guard
rode
out
of
hearing
of
both
herd
and
camp
to
try
out
the
horses
after
an
hour
the
quartette
returned
and
under
solemn
pledges
of
secrecy
stallings
said
why
that
old
bay
harness
mare
ca
run
fast
enough
to
keep
up
with
a
funeral
i
rode
her
myself
and
if
she
got
any
run
in
her
rowel
and
quirt
wo
bring
it
out
that
chestnut
of
john
ran
away
from
her
as
if
she
was
hobbled
and
while
this
coyote
of
mine
threw
dust
in
her
face
every
jump
in
the
road
from
the
word
if
the
old
man
is
bluffing
and
will
hack
his
mare
we
get
back
our
money
with
good
interest
mind
you
now
we
must
keep
it
a
dead
secret
from
flood
that
we
tried
the
mare
he
might
get
funny
and
tip
the
old
man
we
all
swore
great
oaths
that
flood
should
never
hear
a
breath
of
it
the
conspirators
and
their
accomplices
rode
into
camp
and
we
resumed
our
sentinel
rounds
i
had
some
money
and
figured
that
betting
in
a
cinch
like
this
would
be
like
finding
money
in
the
road
but
the
rebel
when
we
were
returning
from
guard
said
tom
you
keep
out
of
this
race
the
boys
are
trying
to
jump
up
i
met
a
good
many
innocent
men
in
my
life
and
there
something
about
this
old
man
that
reminds
me
of
people
who
have
an
axe
to
grind
let
the
other
fellows
run
on
the
rope
if
they
want
to
but
you
keep
your
money
in
your
pocket
take
an
older
man
advice
this
once
and
i
going
to
round
up
john
in
the
morning
and
try
and
beat
a
little
sense
into
his
head
for
he
thinks
it
a
dead
immortal
cinch
i
had
made
it
a
rule
during
our
brief
acquaintance
never
to
argue
matters
with
my
bunkie
well
knowing
that
his
years
and
experience
in
the
ways
of
the
world
entitled
his
advice
to
my
earnest
consideration
so
i
kept
silent
though
secretly
wishing
he
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
throw
cold
water
on
my
hopes
for
i
had
built
several
air
castles
with
the
money
which
seemed
within
my
grasp
we
had
been
out
then
over
four
months
and
i
like
many
of
the
other
boys
was
getting
ragged
and
with
ogalalla
within
a
week
drive
a
town
which
it
took
money
to
see
properly
i
thought
it
a
burning
shame
to
let
this
opportunity
pass
when
i
awoke
the
next
morning
the
camp
was
astir
and
my
first
look
was
in
the
direction
of
the
harness
mare
grazing
peacefully
on
the
picket
rope
where
she
had
been
tethered
the
night
before
breakfast
over
our
venerable
visitor
harnessed
in
his
team
preparatory
to
starting
stallings
had
made
it
a
point
to
return
to
the
herd
for
a
parting
word
well
if
you
must
go
on
ahead
said
joe
to
the
old
man
as
the
latter
was
ready
to
depart
remember
that
you
can
get
action
on
your
money
if
you
still
think
that
your
bay
mare
can
outrun
that
brown
cow
horse
which
i
pointed
out
to
you
yesterday
you
need
let
your
poverty
interfere
for
we
run
you
to
suit
your
purse
light
or
heavy
the
herd
will
reach
the
river
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
or
a
little
later
and
you
be
sure
and
stay
overnight
there
stay
with
us
if
you
want
to
and
we
make
up
a
little
race
for
any
sum
you
say
from
marbles
and
chalk
to
a
hundred
dollars
i
may
be
as
badly
deceived
in
your
mare
as
i
think
you
are
in
my
horse
but
if
you
a
tennesseean
here
your
chance
but
beyond
giving
stallings
his
word
that
he
would
see
him
again
during
the
afternoon
or
evening
the
old
man
would
make
no
definite
proposition
and
drove
away
there
was
a
difference
of
opinion
amongst
the
outfit
some
asserting
that
we
would
never
see
him
again
while
the
larger
portion
of
us
were
at
least
hopeful
that
we
would
after
our
guest
was
well
out
of
sight
and
before
the
wagon
started
stallings
corralled
the
a
second
time
and
taking
out
brown
and
officer
chestnut
tried
the
two
horses
for
a
short
dash
of
about
a
hundred
yards
the
trial
confirmed
the
general
opinion
of
the
outfit
for
the
brown
outran
the
chestnut
over
four
lengths
starting
half
a
neck
in
the
rear
a
general
canvass
of
the
outfit
was
taken
and
to
my
surprise
there
was
over
three
hundred
dollars
amongst
us
i
had
over
forty
dollars
but
i
only
promised
to
loan
mine
if
it
was
needed
while
priest
refused
either
to
lend
or
bet
his
i
wanted
to
bet
and
it
would
grieve
me
to
the
quick
if
there
was
any
chance
and
i
did
take
it
but
i
was
young
then
flood
met
us
at
noon
about
seven
miles
out
from
the
republican
with
the
superintendent
of
a
cattle
company
in
montana
and
before
we
started
the
herd
after
dinner
had
sold
our
wagon
and
mules
for
delivery
at
the
nearest
railroad
point
to
the
blackfoot
agency
sometime
during
september
this
cattle
company
so
we
afterwards
learned
from
flood
had
headquarters
at
helena
while
their
ranges
were
somewhere
on
the
headwaters
of
the
missouri
but
the
sale
of
the
horses
seemed
to
us
an
insignificant
matter
compared
with
the
race
which
was
on
the
tapis
and
when
stallings
had
made
the
ablest
talk
of
his
life
for
the
loan
of
the
brown
flood
asked
the
new
owner
a
texan
himself
if
he
had
any
objections
certainly
not
said
he
let
the
boys
have
a
little
fun
i
glad
to
know
that
the
has
fast
horses
in
it
why
did
you
tell
me
flood
i
might
have
paid
you
extra
if
i
had
known
i
was
buying
racehorses
be
sure
and
have
the
race
come
off
this
evening
for
i
want
to
see
it
and
he
was
not
only
good
enough
to
give
his
consent
but
added
a
word
of
advice
there
a
deadfall
down
here
on
the
river
said
he
that
robs
a
man
going
and
coming
they
got
booze
to
sell
you
that
would
make
a
pet
rabbit
fight
a
wolf
and
if
you
ca
stand
the
whiskey
why
they
have
skin
games
running
to
fleece
you
as
fast
as
you
can
get
your
money
to
the
centre
be
sure
lads
and
let
both
their
whiskey
and
cards
alone
while
changing
mounts
after
dinner
stallings
caught
out
the
brown
horse
and
tied
him
behind
the
wagon
while
flood
and
the
horse
buyer
returned
to
the
river
in
the
conveyance
our
foreman
having
left
his
horse
at
the
ford
when
we
reached
the
republican
with
the
herd
about
two
hours
before
sundown
and
while
we
were
crossing
and
watering
who
should
ride
up
on
the
spanish
mule
but
our
tennessee
friend
if
anything
he
was
a
trifle
more
talkative
and
boastful
than
before
which
was
easily
accounted
for
as
it
was
evident
that
he
was
drinking
and
producing
a
large
bottle
which
had
but
a
few
drinks
left
in
it
insisted
on
every
one
taking
a
drink
with
him
he
said
he
was
encamped
half
a
mile
down
the
river
and
that
he
would
race
his
mare
against
our
horse
for
fifty
dollars
that
if
we
were
in
earnest
and
would
go
back
with
him
and
post
our
money
at
the
tent
he
would
cover
it
then
stallings
in
turn
became
crafty
and
diplomatic
and
after
asking
a
number
of
unimportant
questions
regarding
conditions
returned
to
the
joint
with
the
old
man
taking
fox
quarternight
to
the
rest
of
us
it
looked
as
though
there
was
going
to
be
no
chance
to
bet
a
dollar
even
but
after
the
herd
had
been
watered
and
we
had
grazed
out
some
distance
from
the
river
the
two
worthies
returned
they
had
posted
their
money
and
all
the
conditions
were
agreed
upon
the
race
was
to
take
place
at
sundown
over
at
the
saloon
and
gambling
joint
in
reply
to
an
earnest
inquiry
by
bob
blades
the
outfit
were
informed
that
we
might
get
some
side
bets
with
the
gamblers
but
the
money
already
posted
was
theirs
win
or
lose
this
selfishness
was
not
looked
upon
very
favorably
and
some
harsh
comments
were
made
but
stallings
and
quarternight
were
immovable
we
had
an
early
supper
and
pressing
in
mccann
to
assist
the
rebel
in
grazing
the
herd
until
our
return
the
cavalcade
set
out
flood
and
the
horse
buyer
with
us
my
bunkie
urged
me
to
let
him
keep
my
money
but
under
the
pretense
of
some
of
the
outfit
wanting
to
borrow
it
i
took
it
with
me
the
race
was
to
be
catch
weights
and
as
rod
wheat
was
the
lightest
in
our
outfit
the
riding
fell
to
him
on
the
way
over
i
worked
bull
durham
out
to
one
side
and
after
explaining
the
jacketing
i
had
got
from
priest
and
the
partial
promise
i
had
made
not
to
bet
gave
him
my
forty
dollars
to
wager
for
me
if
he
got
a
chance
bull
and
i
were
good
friends
and
on
the
understanding
that
it
was
to
be
a
secret
i
intimated
that
some
of
the
velvet
would
line
his
purse
on
reaching
the
tent
we
found
about
half
a
dozen
men
loitering
around
among
them
the
old
man
who
promptly
invited
us
all
to
have
a
drink
with
him
a
number
of
us
accepted
and
took
a
chance
against
the
vintage
of
this
canvas
roadhouse
though
the
warnings
of
the
montana
horse
buyer
were
fully
justified
by
the
quality
of
the
goods
dispensed
while
taking
the
drink
the
old
man
was
lamenting
his
poverty
which
kept
him
from
betting
more
money
and
after
we
had
gone
outside
the
saloonkeeper
came
and
said
to
him
in
a
burst
of
generous
feeling
old
sport
you
a
stranger
to
me
but
i
can
see
at
a
glance
that
you
a
dead
game
man
now
if
you
need
any
more
money
just
give
me
a
bill
of
sale
of
your
mare
and
mule
and
i
advance
you
a
hundred
of
course
i
know
nothing
about
the
merits
of
the
two
horses
but
i
noticed
your
team
as
you
drove
up
and
if
you
can
use
any
more
money
just
ask
for
it
the
old
man
jumped
at
the
proposition
in
delighted
surprise
the
two
reëntered
the
tent
and
after
killing
considerable
time
in
writing
out
a
bill
of
sale
the
old
graybeard
came
out
shaking
a
roll
of
bills
at
us
he
was
promptly
accommodated
bull
durham
making
the
first
bet
of
fifty
and
as
i
caught
his
eye
i
walked
away
shaking
hands
with
myself
over
my
crafty
scheme
when
the
old
man
money
was
all
taken
the
of
the
place
became
enthusiastic
over
the
betting
and
took
every
bet
while
there
was
a
dollar
in
sight
amongst
our
crowd
the
horse
buyer
even
making
a
wager
when
we
were
out
of
money
they
offered
to
bet
against
our
saddles
and
watches
flood
warned
us
not
to
bet
our
saddles
but
quarternight
and
stallings
had
already
wagered
theirs
and
were
stripping
them
from
their
horses
to
turn
them
over
to
the
saloonkeeper
as
stakeholder
i
managed
to
get
a
bet
on
my
though
it
was
worth
double
the
money
and
a
similar
amount
on
my
watch
when
the
betting
ended
every
watch
and
in
the
outfit
was
in
the
hands
of
the
stakeholder
and
had
it
not
been
for
flood
our
saddles
would
have
been
in
the
same
hands
it
was
to
be
a
three
hundred
yard
race
with
an
ask
and
answer
start
between
the
riders
stallings
and
the
old
man
stepped
off
the
course
parallel
with
the
river
and
laid
a
rope
on
the
ground
to
mark
the
start
and
the
finish
the
sun
had
already
set
and
twilight
was
deepening
when
the
old
man
signaled
to
his
boy
in
the
distance
to
bring
up
the
mare
wheat
was
slowly
walking
the
brown
horse
over
the
course
when
the
boy
came
up
cantering
the
mare
blanketed
with
an
old
government
blanket
over
the
imaginary
track
also
these
preliminaries
thrilled
us
like
the
tuning
of
a
fiddle
for
a
dance
stallings
and
the
old
homesteader
went
out
to
the
starting
point
to
give
the
riders
the
terms
of
the
race
while
the
remainder
of
us
congregated
at
the
finish
it
was
getting
dusk
when
the
blanket
was
stripped
from
the
mare
and
the
riders
began
jockeying
for
a
start
in
that
twilight
stillness
we
could
hear
the
question
are
you
ready
and
the
answer
no
as
the
two
jockeys
came
up
to
the
starting
rope
but
finally
there
was
an
affirmative
answer
and
the
two
horses
were
coming
through
like
arrows
in
their
flight
my
heart
stood
still
for
the
time
being
and
when
the
bay
mare
crossed
the
rope
at
the
outcome
an
easy
winner
i
was
speechless
such
a
lot
of
men
as
we
were
would
be
hard
to
conceive
we
had
been
beaten
and
not
only
felt
it
but
looked
it
flood
brought
us
to
our
senses
by
calling
our
attention
to
the
approaching
darkness
and
setting
off
in
a
gallop
toward
the
herd
the
rest
of
us
trailed
along
silently
after
him
in
threes
and
fours
after
the
herd
had
been
bedded
and
we
had
gone
in
to
the
wagon
my
spirits
were
slightly
lightened
at
the
sight
of
the
two
arch
conspirators
stallings
and
quarternight
meekly
riding
in
bareback
i
enjoyed
the
laughter
of
the
rebel
and
mccann
at
their
plight
but
when
my
bunkie
noticed
my
missing
and
i
admitted
having
bet
it
he
turned
the
laugh
on
me
that
right
son
he
said
do
you
take
anybody
advice
young
yet
but
you
learn
and
when
you
learn
it
for
yourself
you
remember
it
that
much
better
that
night
when
we
were
on
guard
together
i
eased
my
conscience
by
making
a
clean
breast
of
the
whole
affair
to
my
bunkie
which
resulted
in
his
loaning
me
ten
dollars
with
which
to
redeem
my
in
the
morning
but
the
other
boys
with
the
exception
of
officer
had
no
banker
to
call
on
as
we
had
and
when
quarternight
and
stallings
asked
the
foreman
what
they
were
to
do
for
saddles
the
latter
suggested
that
one
of
them
could
use
the
cook
while
the
other
could
take
it
bareback
or
ride
in
the
wagon
but
the
montana
man
interceded
in
their
behalf
and
flood
finally
gave
in
and
advanced
them
enough
to
redeem
their
saddles
our
foreman
had
no
great
amount
of
money
with
him
but
mccann
and
the
horse
buyer
came
to
the
rescue
for
what
they
had
and
the
guns
were
redeemed
not
that
they
were
needed
but
we
would
have
been
so
lonesome
without
them
i
had
worn
one
so
long
i
did
trim
well
without
it
but
toppled
forward
and
could
maintain
my
balance
but
the
most
cruel
exposure
of
the
whole
affair
occurred
when
nat
straw
riding
in
ahead
of
his
herd
overtook
us
one
day
out
from
ogalalla
i
met
old
i
littlefield
said
nat
back
at
the
ford
of
the
republican
and
he
tells
me
that
they
won
over
five
hundred
dollars
off
this
circle
dot
outfit
on
a
horse
race
he
showed
me
a
whole
basketful
of
your
watches
i
used
to
meet
old
i
over
on
the
chisholm
trail
and
he
a
foxy
old
innocent
he
told
me
that
he
put
tar
on
his
harness
mare
back
to
see
if
you
fellows
had
stolen
the
nag
off
the
picket
rope
at
night
and
when
he
found
you
had
he
robbed
you
to
a
finish
he
knew
you
fool
texans
would
bet
your
last
dollar
on
such
a
cinch
that
one
of
his
tricks
you
see
the
mare
you
tried
was
the
one
you
ran
the
race
against
i
seen
them
both
and
they
look
as
much
alike
as
two
pint
bottles
my
but
you
fellows
are
easy
fish
and
then
jim
flood
lay
down
on
the
grass
and
laughed
until
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
and
we
understood
that
there
were
tricks
in
other
trades
than
ours
chapter
xvii
ogalalla
from
the
head
of
stinking
water
to
the
south
platte
was
a
waterless
stretch
of
forty
miles
but
by
watering
the
herd
about
the
middle
of
one
forenoon
after
grazing
we
could
get
to
water
again
the
following
evening
with
the
exception
of
the
meeting
with
nat
straw
the
drive
was
featureless
but
the
night
that
nat
stayed
with
us
he
regaled
us
with
his
experiences
in
which
he
was
as
lucky
as
ever
where
we
had
lost
three
days
on
the
canadian
with
bogged
cattle
he
had
crossed
it
within
fifteen
minutes
after
reaching
it
his
herd
was
sold
before
reaching
dodge
so
that
he
lost
no
time
there
and
on
reaching
slaughter
bridge
he
was
only
two
days
behind
our
herd
his
cattle
were
then
en
route
for
delivery
on
the
crazy
woman
in
wyoming
and
as
he
put
it
any
herd
was
liable
to
travel
faster
when
it
had
a
new
owner
flood
had
heard
from
our
employer
at
culbertson
learning
that
he
would
not
meet
us
at
ogalalla
as
his
last
herd
was
due
in
dodge
about
that
time
my
brother
bob
herd
had
crossed
the
arkansaw
a
week
behind
us
and
was
then
possibly
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
our
rear
we
all
regretted
not
being
able
to
see
old
man
don
for
he
believed
that
nothing
was
too
good
for
his
men
and
we
all
remembered
the
good
time
he
had
shown
us
in
dodge
the
smoke
of
passing
trains
hung
for
hours
in
signal
clouds
in
our
front
during
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
dry
drive
but
we
finally
scaled
the
last
divide
and
there
below
us
in
the
valley
of
the
south
platte
nestled
ogalalla
the
gomorrah
of
the
cattle
trail
from
amongst
its
half
hundred
buildings
no
church
spire
pointed
upward
but
instead
three
fourths
of
its
business
houses
were
dance
halls
gambling
houses
and
saloons
we
all
knew
the
town
by
reputation
while
the
larger
part
of
our
outfit
had
been
in
it
before
it
was
there
that
joel
collins
and
his
outfit
rendezvoused
when
they
robbed
the
union
pacific
train
in
october
collins
had
driven
a
herd
of
cattle
for
his
father
and
brother
and
after
selling
them
in
the
black
hills
gambled
away
the
proceeds
some
five
or
six
of
his
outfit
returned
to
ogalalla
with
him
and
being
moneyless
concluded
to
recoup
their
losses
at
the
expense
of
the
railway
company
going
eighteen
miles
up
the
river
to
big
springs
seven
of
them
robbed
the
express
and
passengers
the
former
yielding
sixty
thousand
dollars
in
gold
the
next
morning
they
were
in
ogalalla
paying
debts
and
getting
their
horses
shod
in
collins
outfit
was
sam
bass
and
under
his
leadership
until
he
met
his
death
the
following
spring
at
the
hands
of
texas
rangers
the
course
of
the
outfit
southward
was
marked
by
a
series
of
daring
bank
and
train
robberies
we
reached
the
river
late
that
evening
and
after
watering
grazed
until
dark
and
camped
for
the
night
but
it
was
not
to
be
a
night
of
rest
and
sleep
for
the
lights
were
twinkling
across
the
river
in
town
and
cook
horse
wrangler
and
all
with
the
exception
of
the
first
guard
rode
across
the
river
after
the
herd
had
been
bedded
flood
had
quit
us
while
we
were
watering
the
herd
and
gone
in
ahead
to
get
a
draft
cashed
for
he
was
as
moneyless
as
the
rest
of
us
but
his
letter
of
credit
was
good
anywhere
on
the
trail
where
money
was
to
be
had
and
on
reaching
town
he
took
us
into
a
general
outfitting
store
and
paid
us
dollars
apiece
after
warning
us
to
be
on
hand
at
the
wagon
to
stand
our
watches
he
left
us
and
we
scattered
like
lost
sheep
officer
and
i
paid
our
loans
to
the
rebel
and
the
three
of
us
wandered
around
for
several
hours
in
company
with
nat
straw
when
we
were
in
dodge
my
bunkie
had
shown
no
inclination
to
gamble
but
now
he
was
the
first
one
to
suggest
that
we
make
up
a
cow
and
let
him
try
his
luck
at
monte
straw
and
officer
were
both
willing
and
though
in
rags
i
willingly
consented
and
contributed
my
five
to
the
general
fund
every
gambling
house
ran
from
two
to
three
monte
layouts
as
it
was
a
favorite
game
of
cowmen
especially
when
they
were
from
the
far
southern
country
priest
soon
found
a
game
to
his
liking
and
after
watching
his
play
through
several
deals
officer
and
i
left
him
with
the
understanding
that
he
would
start
for
camp
promptly
at
midnight
there
was
much
to
be
seen
though
it
was
a
small
place
for
the
ends
of
the
earth
iniquity
had
gathered
in
ogalalla
we
wandered
through
the
various
gambling
houses
drinking
moderately
meeting
an
occasional
acquaintance
from
texas
and
in
the
course
of
our
rounds
landed
in
the
dance
hall
here
might
be
seen
the
frailty
of
women
in
every
grade
and
condition
from
girls
in
their
teens
launching
out
on
a
life
of
shame
to
the
adventuress
who
had
once
had
youth
and
beauty
in
her
favor
but
was
now
discarded
and
ready
for
the
final
dose
of
opium
and
the
coroner
verdict
all
were
there
in
tinsel
and
paint
practicing
a
careless
exposure
of
their
charms
in
a
town
which
has
no
night
the
hours
pass
rapidly
and
before
we
were
aware
midnight
was
upon
us
returning
to
the
gambling
house
where
we
had
left
priest
we
found
him
over
a
hundred
dollars
winner
and
calling
his
attention
to
the
hour
persuaded
him
to
cash
in
and
join
us
we
felt
positively
rich
as
he
counted
out
to
each
partner
his
share
of
the
winnings
straw
was
missing
to
receive
his
but
we
knew
he
could
be
found
on
the
morrow
and
after
a
round
of
drinks
we
forded
the
river
as
we
rode
along
my
bunkie
said
superstitious
and
i
ca
help
it
but
i
felt
for
a
day
or
so
that
i
was
in
luck
and
i
wanted
you
lads
in
with
me
if
my
warning
was
true
i
never
was
afraid
to
go
into
battle
but
once
and
just
as
we
were
ordered
into
action
a
shell
killed
my
horse
under
me
and
i
was
left
behind
i
had
lots
of
such
warnings
good
and
bad
and
influenced
by
them
if
we
get
off
and
i
in
the
mood
go
back
there
and
make
some
monte
bank
look
sick
we
reached
the
wagon
in
good
time
to
be
called
on
our
guard
and
after
it
was
over
secured
a
few
hours
sleep
before
the
foreman
aroused
us
in
the
morning
with
herds
above
and
below
us
we
would
either
have
to
graze
contrary
to
our
course
or
cross
the
river
the
south
platte
was
a
wide
sandy
river
with
numerous
channels
and
as
easily
crossed
as
an
alkali
flat
of
equal
width
so
far
as
water
was
concerned
the
sun
was
not
an
hour
high
when
we
crossed
passing
within
two
hundred
yards
of
the
business
section
of
the
town
which
lay
under
a
hill
the
valley
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
and
beyond
the
railroad
was
not
over
half
a
mile
wide
and
as
we
angled
across
it
the
town
seemed
as
dead
as
those
that
slept
in
the
graveyard
on
the
first
hill
beside
the
trail
finding
good
grass
about
a
mile
farther
on
we
threw
the
herd
off
the
trail
and
leaving
orders
to
graze
until
noon
the
foreman
with
the
first
and
second
guard
returned
to
town
it
was
only
about
ten
miles
over
to
the
north
platte
where
water
was
certain
and
in
the
hope
that
we
would
be
permitted
to
revisit
the
village
during
the
afternoon
we
who
were
on
guard
threw
riders
in
the
lead
of
the
grazing
cattle
in
order
not
to
be
too
far
away
should
permission
be
granted
us
that
was
a
long
morning
for
us
of
the
third
and
fourth
guards
with
nothing
to
do
but
let
the
cattle
feed
while
easy
money
itched
in
our
pockets
behind
us
lay
ogalalla
and
our
craft
did
dearly
love
to
break
the
monotony
of
our
work
by
getting
into
town
but
by
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
the
wagon
and
saddle
horses
overtook
us
and
ordering
mccann
into
camp
a
scant
mile
in
our
lead
we
allowed
the
cattle
to
lie
down
they
having
grazed
to
contentment
leaving
two
men
on
guard
the
remainder
of
us
rode
in
to
the
wagon
and
lightened
with
an
hour
sleep
in
its
shade
the
time
which
hung
heavy
on
our
hands
we
were
aroused
by
our
horse
wrangler
who
had
sighted
a
cavalcade
down
the
trail
which
from
the
color
of
their
horses
he
knew
to
be
our
outfit
returning
as
they
came
nearer
and
their
numbers
could
be
made
out
it
was
evident
that
our
foreman
was
not
with
them
and
our
hopes
rose
on
coming
up
they
informed
us
that
we
were
to
have
a
half
holiday
while
they
would
take
the
herd
over
to
the
north
river
during
the
afternoon
then
emergency
orders
rang
out
to
honeyman
and
mccann
and
as
soon
as
a
change
of
mounts
could
be
secured
our
dinners
bolted
and
the
herders
relieved
we
were
ready
to
go
two
of
the
six
who
returned
had
shed
their
rags
and
swaggered
about
in
new
cheap
suits
the
rest
although
they
had
money
simply
had
not
had
the
time
to
buy
clothes
in
a
place
with
so
many
attractions
when
the
herders
came
in
deft
hands
transferred
their
saddles
to
waiting
mounts
while
they
swallowed
a
hasty
dinner
and
we
set
out
for
ogalalla
happy
as
city
urchins
in
an
orchard
we
were
less
than
five
miles
from
the
burg
and
struck
a
free
gait
in
riding
in
where
we
found
several
hundred
of
our
craft
holding
high
jinks
a
number
of
herds
had
paid
off
their
outfits
and
were
sending
them
home
while
from
the
herds
for
sale
holding
along
the
river
every
man
not
on
day
herd
was
paying
his
respects
to
the
town
we
had
not
been
there
five
minutes
when
a
horse
race
was
run
through
the
main
street
nat
straw
and
jim
flood
acting
as
judges
on
the
outcome
the
officers
of
ogalalla
were
a
different
crowd
from
what
we
had
encountered
at
dodge
and
everything
went
the
place
suited
us
straw
had
entirely
forgotten
our
cow
of
the
night
before
and
when
the
rebel
handed
him
his
share
of
the
winnings
he
tucked
it
away
in
the
watch
pocket
of
his
trousers
without
counting
but
he
had
arranged
a
fiddling
match
between
a
darky
cook
of
one
of
the
returning
outfits
and
a
locoed
white
man
a
mendicant
of
the
place
and
invited
us
to
be
present
straw
knew
the
foreman
of
the
outfit
to
which
the
darky
belonged
and
the
two
had
fixed
it
up
to
pit
the
two
in
a
contest
under
the
pretense
that
a
large
wager
had
been
made
on
which
was
the
better
fiddler
the
contest
was
to
take
place
at
once
in
the
corral
of
the
lone
star
livery
stable
and
promised
to
be
humorous
if
nothing
more
so
after
the
race
was
over
the
next
number
on
the
programme
was
the
fiddling
match
and
we
followed
the
crowd
the
rebel
had
given
us
the
slip
during
the
race
though
none
of
us
cared
as
we
knew
he
was
hungering
for
a
monte
game
it
was
a
motley
crowd
which
had
gathered
in
the
corral
and
all
seemed
to
know
of
the
farce
to
be
enacted
though
the
texas
outfit
to
which
the
darky
belonged
were
flashing
their
money
on
their
dusky
cook
as
the
best
fiddler
that
ever
crossed
red
river
with
a
cow
herd
oh
i
do
know
that
your
man
is
such
an
ole
bull
as
all
that
said
nat
straw
i
just
got
a
hundred
posted
which
says
he
ca
even
play
a
decent
second
to
my
man
and
if
we
can
get
a
competent
set
of
judges
to
decide
the
contest
i
wager
a
little
more
on
the
white
against
the
black
though
i
know
your
man
is
a
a
canvass
of
the
crowd
was
made
for
judges
but
as
nearly
every
one
claimed
to
be
interested
in
the
result
having
made
wagers
or
was
incompetent
to
sit
in
judgment
on
a
musical
contest
there
was
some
little
delay
finally
joe
stallings
went
to
nat
straw
and
told
him
that
i
was
a
fiddler
whereupon
he
instantly
appointed
me
as
judge
and
the
other
side
selected
a
redheaded
fellow
belonging
to
one
of
dillard
fant
herds
between
the
two
of
us
we
selected
as
the
third
judge
a
bartender
whom
i
had
met
the
night
before
the
conditions
governing
the
contest
were
given
us
and
two
chuck
wagons
were
drawn
up
alongside
each
other
in
one
of
which
were
seated
the
contestants
and
in
the
other
the
judges
the
gravity
of
the
crowd
was
only
broken
as
some
enthusiast
cheered
his
favorite
or
defiantly
offered
to
wager
on
the
man
of
his
choice
numerous
sham
bets
were
being
made
when
the
redheaded
judge
arose
and
announced
the
conditions
and
urged
the
crowd
to
remain
quiet
that
the
contestants
might
have
equal
justice
each
fiddler
selected
his
own
piece
the
first
number
was
a
waltz
on
the
conclusion
of
which
partisanship
ran
high
each
faction
cheering
its
favorite
to
the
echo
the
second
number
was
a
jig
and
as
the
darky
drew
his
bow
several
times
across
the
strings
tentatively
his
foreman
who
stood
six
inches
taller
than
any
man
in
a
crowd
of
tall
men
tapped
himself
on
the
breast
with
one
forefinger
and
with
the
other
pointed
at
his
dusky
champion
saying
keep
your
eye
on
me
price
we
going
home
together
remember
you
black
rascal
you
can
make
a
mocking
bird
ashamed
of
itself
if
you
try
you
know
i
swore
by
you
through
thick
and
thin
now
win
this
money
pay
no
attention
to
any
one
else
keep
your
eye
on
me
straw
not
to
be
outdone
in
encouragement
cheered
his
man
with
promises
of
reward
and
his
faction
of
supporters
raised
such
a
din
that
fant
man
arose
and
demanded
quiet
so
the
contest
could
proceed
though
boisterous
the
crowd
was
and
after
the
second
number
was
disposed
of
the
final
test
was
announced
which
was
to
be
in
sacred
music
on
this
announcement
the
tall
foreman
waded
through
the
crowd
and
drawing
the
darky
to
him
whispered
something
in
his
ear
and
then
fell
back
to
his
former
position
the
dusky
artist
countenance
brightened
and
with
a
few
preliminaries
he
struck
into
the
arkansaw
traveler
throwing
so
many
contortions
into
its
execution
that
it
seemed
as
if
life
and
liberty
depended
on
his
exertions
the
usual
applause
greeted
him
on
its
conclusion
when
nat
straw
climbed
up
on
the
wagon
wheel
and
likewise
whispered
something
to
his
champion
the
little
old
weazened
mendicant
took
his
cue
and
cut
into
the
irish
washerwoman
with
a
great
flourish
and
in
the
refrain
chanted
an
unintelligible
gibberish
like
the
yelping
of
a
coyote
which
the
audience
so
cheered
that
he
repeated
it
several
times
the
crowd
now
gathered
around
the
wagons
and
clamored
for
the
decision
and
after
consulting
among
ourselves
some
little
time
and
knowing
that
a
neutral
or
indefinite
verdict
was
desired
we
delegated
the
bartender
to
announce
our
conclusions
taking
off
his
hat
he
arose
and
after
requesting
quietness
pretended
to
read
our
decision
gentlemen
he
began
your
judges
feel
a
delicacy
in
passing
on
the
merits
of
such
distinguished
artists
but
in
the
first
number
the
decision
is
unanimously
in
favor
of
the
darky
while
the
second
is
clearly
in
favor
of
the
white
contestant
in
regard
to
the
last
test
your
judges
can
not
reach
any
decision
as
the
selections
rendered
fail
to
qualify
under
the
head
of
but
two
shots
rang
out
in
rapid
succession
across
the
street
and
the
crowd
including
the
judges
and
fiddlers
rushed
away
to
witness
the
new
excitement
the
shooting
had
occurred
in
a
restaurant
and
quite
a
mob
gathered
around
the
door
when
the
sheriff
emerged
from
the
building
it
nothing
said
he
just
a
couple
of
punchers
who
had
been
drinking
a
little
were
eating
a
snack
and
one
of
them
asked
for
a
second
dish
of
prunes
when
the
waiter
got
gay
and
told
him
that
he
could
have
them
he
was
full
of
prunes
now
so
the
lad
took
a
couple
of
shots
at
him
just
to
learn
him
to
be
more
courteous
to
strangers
there
was
no
harm
done
as
the
puncher
was
too
unsteady
as
the
crowd
dispersed
from
the
restaurant
i
returned
to
the
livery
stable
where
straw
and
several
of
our
outfit
were
explaining
to
the
old
mendicant
that
he
had
simply
outplayed
his
opponent
and
it
was
too
bad
that
they
were
not
better
posted
in
sacred
music
under
straw
leadership
a
purse
was
being
made
up
amongst
them
and
the
old
man
eyes
brightened
as
he
received
several
crisp
bills
and
a
handful
of
silver
straw
was
urging
the
old
fiddler
to
post
himself
in
regard
to
sacred
music
and
he
would
get
up
another
match
for
the
next
day
when
rod
wheat
came
up
and
breathlessly
informed
officer
and
myself
that
the
rebel
wanted
us
over
at
the
black
elephant
gambling
hall
as
we
turned
to
accompany
him
we
eagerly
inquired
if
there
were
any
trouble
wheat
informed
us
there
was
not
but
that
priest
was
playing
in
one
of
the
biggest
streaks
of
luck
that
ever
happened
why
the
old
man
is
just
wallowing
in
velvet
said
rod
as
we
hurried
along
and
the
dealer
has
lowered
the
limit
from
a
hundred
to
fifty
for
old
paul
is
playing
them
as
high
as
a
cat
tack
he
drinking
a
drop
and
is
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
i
do
know
what
he
wants
with
you
fellows
but
he
begged
me
to
hunt
you
up
and
send
you
to
him
the
black
elephant
was
about
a
block
from
the
livery
and
as
we
entered
a
large
crowd
of
bystanders
were
watching
the
playing
around
one
of
the
three
monte
games
which
were
running
elbowing
our
way
through
the
crowd
we
reached
my
bunkie
whom
officer
slapped
on
the
back
and
inquired
what
he
wanted
why
i
want
you
and
quirk
to
bet
a
little
money
for
me
he
replied
my
luck
is
with
me
and
when
i
try
to
crowd
it
this
layout
gets
foxy
and
pinches
the
limit
down
to
fifty
here
take
this
money
and
cover
both
those
other
games
call
out
as
they
fall
the
layouts
and
i
pick
the
card
to
bet
the
money
on
and
bet
her
carelessly
boys
for
she
velvet
as
he
spoke
he
gave
officer
and
myself
each
a
handful
of
uncounted
money
and
we
proceeded
to
carry
out
his
instructions
i
knew
the
game
perfectly
having
spent
several
years
earnings
on
my
tuition
and
was
past
master
in
the
technical
spanish
terms
of
the
game
while
officer
was
equally
informed
john
took
the
table
to
the
right
while
i
took
the
one
on
the
left
and
waiting
for
a
new
deal
called
the
cards
as
they
fell
i
inquired
the
limit
of
the
dealer
and
was
politely
informed
that
it
was
fifty
at
first
our
director
ordered
a
number
of
small
bets
made
as
though
feeling
his
way
for
cards
will
turn
but
as
he
found
the
old
luck
was
still
with
him
he
gradually
increased
them
to
the
limit
after
the
first
few
deals
i
caught
on
to
his
favorite
cards
which
were
the
queen
and
seven
and
on
these
we
bet
the
limit
aces
and
a
face
against
an
ace
were
also
favorite
bets
of
the
rebel
but
for
a
smaller
sum
during
the
first
hour
of
my
playing
to
show
the
luck
of
cards
the
queen
won
five
consecutive
times
once
against
a
favorite
at
the
conclusion
of
a
deal
my
judgment
was
to
take
up
this
bet
but
priest
ordered
otherwise
for
it
was
one
of
his
principles
never
to
doubt
a
card
as
long
as
it
won
for
you
the
play
had
run
along
some
time
and
as
i
was
absorbed
with
watching
some
one
behind
me
laid
a
friendly
hand
on
my
shoulder
having
every
card
in
the
layout
covered
with
a
bet
at
the
time
and
supposing
it
to
be
some
of
our
outfit
i
never
looked
around
when
there
came
a
slap
on
my
back
which
nearly
loosened
my
teeth
turning
to
see
who
was
making
so
free
with
me
when
i
was
absorbed
my
eye
fell
on
my
brother
zack
but
i
had
not
time
even
to
shake
hands
with
him
for
two
cards
won
in
succession
and
the
dealer
was
paying
me
while
the
queen
and
seven
were
covered
to
the
limit
and
were
yet
to
be
drawn
for
when
the
deal
ended
and
while
the
dealer
was
shuffling
i
managed
to
get
a
few
words
with
my
brother
and
learned
that
he
had
come
through
with
a
herd
belonging
to
jim
reed
and
that
they
were
holding
about
ten
miles
up
the
river
he
had
met
flood
who
told
him
that
i
was
in
town
but
as
he
was
working
on
first
guard
with
their
herd
it
was
high
time
he
was
riding
the
dealer
was
waiting
for
me
to
cut
the
cards
and
stopping
only
to
wring
zack
hand
in
farewell
i
turned
again
to
the
monte
layout
officer
was
not
so
fortunate
as
i
was
partly
by
reason
of
delays
the
dealer
in
his
game
changing
decks
on
almost
every
deal
and
under
priest
orders
we
counted
the
cards
with
every
change
of
the
deck
a
gambler
would
rather
burn
money
than
lose
to
a
citizen
and
every
hoodoo
which
the
superstition
of
the
craft
could
invoke
to
turn
the
run
of
the
cards
was
used
to
check
us
several
hours
passed
and
the
lamps
were
lighted
but
we
constantly
added
to
the
good
to
the
discomfiture
of
the
owners
of
the
games
dealers
changed
but
our
vigilance
never
relaxed
for
a
moment
suddenly
an
altercation
sprang
up
between
officer
and
the
dealer
of
his
game
the
seven
had
proved
the
most
lucky
card
to
john
which
fact
was
as
plain
to
dealer
as
to
player
but
the
dealer
by
slipping
one
seven
out
of
the
pack
after
it
had
been
counted
which
was
possible
in
the
hands
of
an
adept
in
spite
of
all
vigilance
threw
the
percentage
against
the
favorite
card
and
in
favor
of
the
bank
officer
had
suspected
something
wrong
for
the
seven
had
been
loser
during
several
deals
when
with
a
layout
and
two
cards
of
each
class
yet
in
the
pack
the
dealer
drew
down
until
there
were
less
than
a
dozen
cards
left
when
the
king
came
which
lost
a
fifty
dollar
bet
on
the
seven
officer
laid
his
hand
on
the
money
and
as
was
his
privilege
said
to
the
dealer
let
me
look
over
the
remainder
of
those
cards
if
there
two
sevens
there
you
have
won
if
there
is
do
offer
to
touch
this
bet
but
the
gambler
declined
the
request
and
officer
repeated
his
demand
laying
a
across
the
bet
with
the
remark
well
if
you
expect
to
rake
in
this
bet
you
have
my
terms
evidently
the
demand
would
not
have
stood
the
test
for
the
dealer
bunched
the
deck
among
the
passed
cards
and
officer
quietly
raked
in
the
money
when
i
want
a
skin
game
said
john
as
he
arose
come
back
and
see
you
you
saw
me
take
this
money
did
you
well
if
you
got
anything
to
say
now
your
time
to
spit
it
out
but
his
calling
had
made
the
gambler
discreet
and
he
deigned
no
reply
to
the
lank
texan
who
chafing
under
the
attempt
to
cheat
him
slowly
returned
his
to
its
holster
although
holding
my
own
in
my
game
i
was
anxious
to
have
it
come
to
a
close
but
neither
of
us
cared
to
suggest
it
to
the
rebel
it
was
his
money
but
officer
passed
outside
the
house
shortly
afterward
and
soon
returned
with
jim
flood
and
nat
straw
as
our
foreman
approached
the
table
at
which
priest
was
playing
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
rebel
shoulder
and
said
come
on
paul
all
ready
to
go
to
camp
where
quirk
priest
looked
up
in
innocent
amazement
as
though
he
had
been
awakened
out
of
a
deep
sleep
for
in
the
absorption
of
the
game
he
had
taken
no
note
of
the
passing
hours
and
did
not
know
that
the
lamps
were
burning
my
bunkie
obeyed
as
promptly
as
though
the
orders
had
been
given
by
don
lovell
in
person
and
delighted
with
the
turn
of
affairs
i
withdrew
with
him
once
in
the
street
nat
straw
threw
an
arm
around
the
rebel
neck
and
said
to
him
my
dear
sir
the
secret
of
successful
gambling
is
to
quit
when
you
winner
and
before
luck
turns
you
may
think
this
is
a
low
down
trick
but
we
your
friends
and
when
we
heard
that
you
were
a
big
winner
we
were
determined
to
get
you
out
of
there
if
we
had
to
rope
and
drag
you
out
how
much
are
you
winner
before
the
question
could
be
correctly
answered
we
sat
down
on
the
sidewalk
and
the
three
of
us
disgorged
our
winnings
so
that
flood
and
straw
could
count
priest
was
the
largest
winner
officer
the
smallest
while
i
never
will
know
the
amount
of
mine
as
i
had
no
idea
what
i
started
with
but
the
tellers
report
showed
over
fourteen
hundred
dollars
among
the
three
of
us
my
bunkie
consented
to
allow
flood
to
keep
it
for
him
and
the
latter
attempted
to
hurrah
us
off
to
camp
but
john
officer
protested
hold
on
a
minute
jim
said
officer
we
in
rags
we
need
some
clothes
we
been
in
town
long
enough
and
we
got
the
price
but
it
been
such
a
busy
afternoon
with
us
that
we
simply
have
had
the
time
straw
took
our
part
and
flood
giving
in
we
entered
a
general
outfitting
store
from
which
we
emerged
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
wearing
cheap
new
suits
the
color
of
which
we
never
knew
until
the
next
day
then
bidding
straw
a
hearty
farewell
we
rode
for
the
north
platte
on
which
the
herd
would
encamp
as
we
scaled
the
bluffs
we
halted
for
our
last
glimpse
of
the
lights
of
ogalalla
and
the
rebel
remarked
boys
i
traveled
some
in
my
life
but
that
little
hole
back
there
could
give
cards
and
spades
and
then
outhold
her
as
a
tough
town
chapter
xviii
the
north
platte
it
was
now
july
we
had
taken
on
new
supplies
at
ogalalla
and
a
week
afterwards
the
herd
was
snailing
along
the
north
platte
on
its
way
to
the
land
of
the
blackfeet
it
was
always
hard
to
get
a
herd
past
a
supply
point
we
had
the
same
trouble
when
we
passed
dodge
our
long
hours
in
the
saddle
coupled
with
the
monotony
of
our
work
made
these
supply
points
of
such
interest
to
us
that
they
were
like
oases
in
desert
lands
to
devotees
on
pilgrimage
to
some
consecrated
shrine
we
could
have
spent
a
week
in
ogalalla
and
enjoyed
our
visit
every
blessed
moment
of
the
time
but
now
a
week
later
most
of
the
headaches
had
disappeared
and
we
had
settled
down
to
our
daily
work
at
horse
creek
the
last
stream
of
water
before
entering
wyoming
a
lad
who
cut
the
trail
at
that
point
for
some
cattle
companies
after
trimming
us
up
rode
along
for
half
a
day
through
their
range
and
told
us
of
an
accident
which
happened
about
a
week
before
the
horse
of
some
peeler
working
with
one
of
shanghai
pierce
herds
acted
up
one
morning
and
fell
backward
with
him
so
that
his
gun
accidentally
discharged
the
outfit
lay
over
a
day
and
gave
him
as
decent
a
burial
as
they
could
we
would
find
the
grave
ahead
on
squaw
creek
beyond
the
crossing
to
the
right
hand
side
in
a
clump
of
cottonwoods
the
next
day
while
watering
the
herd
at
this
creek
we
all
rode
over
and
looked
at
the
grave
the
outfit
had
fixed
things
up
quite
nicely
they
had
built
a
square
pen
of
rough
cottonwood
logs
around
the
grave
and
had
marked
the
head
and
foot
with
a
big
flat
stone
edged
up
heaping
up
quite
a
mound
of
stones
to
keep
the
animals
away
in
a
tree
his
name
was
cut
sounded
natural
too
though
none
of
us
knew
him
as
pierce
always
drove
from
the
east
coast
country
there
was
nothing
different
about
this
grave
from
the
hundreds
of
others
which
made
landmarks
on
the
old
western
trail
except
it
was
the
latest
that
night
around
the
some
of
the
boys
were
moved
to
tell
their
experiences
this
accident
might
happen
to
any
of
us
and
it
seemed
rather
short
notice
to
a
man
enjoying
life
even
though
his
calling
was
rough
as
for
myself
said
rod
wheat
i
not
going
to
fret
you
avoid
it
when
it
comes
and
every
now
and
then
you
miss
it
by
a
hair
i
had
an
uncle
who
served
four
years
in
the
confederate
army
went
through
thirty
engagements
was
wounded
half
a
dozen
times
and
came
home
well
and
sound
within
a
month
after
his
return
a
plough
handle
kicked
him
in
the
side
and
we
buried
him
within
a
week
oh
well
said
fox
commenting
on
the
sudden
call
of
the
man
whose
grave
we
had
seen
it
wo
make
much
difference
to
this
fellow
back
here
when
the
horn
toots
and
the
graves
give
up
their
dead
he
might
just
as
well
start
from
there
as
anywhere
i
do
envy
him
none
though
but
if
i
had
any
pity
to
offer
now
it
would
be
for
a
mother
or
sister
who
might
wish
that
he
slept
nearer
home
this
last
remark
carried
our
minds
far
away
from
their
present
surroundings
to
other
graves
which
were
not
on
the
trail
there
was
a
long
silence
we
lay
around
the
and
gazed
into
its
depths
while
its
flickering
light
threw
our
shadows
out
beyond
the
circle
our
reverie
was
finally
broken
by
ash
borrowstone
who
was
by
all
odds
the
most
impressionable
and
emotional
one
in
the
outfit
a
man
who
always
argued
the
moral
side
of
every
question
yet
could
not
be
credited
with
possessing
an
iota
of
moral
stamina
gloomy
as
we
were
he
added
to
our
depression
by
relating
a
pathetic
incident
which
occurred
at
a
child
funeral
when
flood
reproved
him
saying
well
neither
that
one
you
mention
nor
this
one
of
pierce
man
is
any
of
our
funeral
we
on
the
trail
with
lovell
cattle
you
should
keep
nearer
the
earth
there
was
a
long
silence
after
this
reproof
of
the
foreman
it
was
evident
there
was
a
gloom
settling
over
the
outfit
our
thoughts
were
ranging
wide
at
last
rod
wheat
spoke
up
and
said
that
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
of
all
the
variations
the
blues
were
not
a
bad
thing
to
have
but
the
depression
of
our
spirits
was
not
so
easily
dismissed
in
order
to
avoid
listening
to
the
gloomy
tales
that
were
being
narrated
around
the
a
number
of
us
got
up
and
went
out
as
if
to
look
up
the
night
horses
on
picket
the
rebel
and
i
pulled
our
picket
pins
and
changed
our
horses
to
fresh
grazing
and
after
lying
down
among
the
horses
out
of
hearing
of
the
camp
for
over
an
hour
returned
to
the
wagon
expecting
to
retire
a
number
of
the
boys
were
making
down
their
beds
as
it
was
already
late
but
on
our
arrival
at
the
fire
one
of
the
boys
had
just
concluded
a
story
as
gloomy
as
the
others
which
had
preceded
it
these
stories
you
are
all
telling
said
flood
remind
me
of
what
lige
link
said
to
the
book
agent
when
he
was
shearing
sheep
reckon
said
lige
book
of
yours
has
a
heap
sight
more
poetry
in
it
than
there
is
in
shearing
sheep
i
wish
i
had
gone
on
guard
so
i
could
have
missed
these
stories
at
this
juncture
the
first
guard
rode
in
having
been
relieved
and
john
officer
who
had
exchanged
places
on
guard
that
night
with
moss
strayhorn
remarked
that
the
cattle
were
uneasy
this
outfit
said
he
did
half
water
the
herd
one
third
of
them
has
bedded
down
yet
and
they
do
act
as
if
they
aim
to
either
there
no
excuse
for
it
in
a
country
like
this
i
leave
the
saddle
on
my
horse
anyhow
now
that
the
result
said
our
foreman
of
the
hour
we
spent
around
that
grave
when
we
ought
to
have
been
tending
to
our
job
this
outfit
he
continued
when
officer
returned
from
picketing
his
horse
have
been
trying
to
hold
funeral
services
over
that
pierce
man
grave
back
there
you
think
so
anyway
from
the
tales
been
telling
i
hope
you
wo
get
the
sniffles
and
tell
any
this
letting
yourself
get
gloomy
said
officer
reminds
me
of
a
time
we
once
had
at
the
camp
in
the
cherokee
strip
it
was
near
christmas
and
the
work
was
all
done
up
the
boys
had
blowed
in
their
summer
wages
and
were
feeling
glum
all
over
one
or
two
of
the
boys
were
lamenting
that
they
had
gone
home
to
see
the
old
folks
this
gloomy
feeling
kept
spreading
until
they
actually
would
speak
to
each
other
one
of
them
would
go
out
and
sit
on
the
wood
pile
for
hours
all
by
himself
and
make
a
new
set
of
good
resolutions
another
would
go
out
and
sit
on
the
ground
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
corrals
and
dig
holes
in
the
frozen
earth
with
his
knife
they
would
come
to
meals
when
the
cook
called
them
now
miller
the
foreman
did
have
any
sympathy
for
them
in
fact
he
delighted
to
see
them
in
that
condition
he
had
any
use
for
a
man
who
was
dead
tough
under
any
condition
i
known
him
to
camp
his
outfit
on
alkali
water
so
the
men
would
get
out
in
the
morning
and
every
rascal
beg
leave
to
ride
on
the
outside
circle
on
the
morning
roundup
well
three
days
before
christmas
just
when
things
were
looking
gloomiest
there
drifted
up
from
the
cheyenne
country
one
of
the
old
timers
none
of
them
had
seen
him
in
four
years
though
he
had
worked
on
that
range
before
and
with
the
exception
of
myself
they
all
knew
him
he
was
riding
the
chuckline
all
right
but
miller
gave
him
a
welcome
as
he
was
the
real
thing
he
had
been
working
out
in
the
country
new
mexico
and
the
devil
knows
where
since
he
had
left
that
range
he
was
meaty
with
news
and
scarey
stories
the
boys
would
sit
around
and
listen
to
him
yarn
and
now
and
then
a
smile
would
come
on
their
faces
miller
was
delighted
with
his
guest
he
had
shown
no
signs
of
letting
up
at
eleven
the
first
night
when
he
happened
to
mention
where
he
was
the
christmas
before
was
a
little
woman
at
the
ranch
said
he
of
the
owner
and
i
was
helping
her
get
up
dinner
as
we
had
quite
a
number
of
folks
at
the
ranch
she
asked
me
to
make
the
bear
sign
doughnuts
she
called
them
and
i
did
though
she
had
to
show
me
how
some
little
well
fellows
you
ought
to
have
seen
them
just
sweet
enough
browned
to
a
turn
and
enough
to
last
a
week
all
the
folks
at
dinner
that
day
praised
them
since
then
i
had
a
chance
to
try
my
hand
several
times
and
you
may
not
tumble
to
the
diversity
of
all
my
accomplishments
but
i
an
artist
on
bear
sign
miller
arose
took
him
by
the
hand
and
said
straight
now
is
it
straight
making
bear
sign
is
my
long
suit
said
miller
to
one
of
the
boys
out
and
bring
in
his
saddle
from
the
stable
and
put
it
under
my
bed
throw
his
horse
in
the
big
pasture
in
the
morning
he
stays
here
until
spring
and
the
first
spear
of
green
grass
i
see
his
name
goes
on
the
pay
roll
this
outfit
is
shy
on
men
who
can
make
bear
sign
now
i
was
thinking
that
you
could
spread
down
your
blankets
on
the
hearth
but
you
can
sleep
with
me
you
go
to
work
on
this
specialty
of
yours
right
after
breakfast
in
the
morning
and
show
us
what
you
can
do
in
that
line
they
talked
quite
a
while
longer
and
then
turned
in
for
the
night
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
was
over
he
got
the
needed
articles
together
and
went
to
work
but
there
was
a
surprise
in
store
for
him
there
was
nearly
a
dozen
men
lying
around
all
able
eaters
by
ten
he
began
to
turn
them
out
as
he
said
he
could
when
the
regular
cook
had
to
have
the
stove
to
get
dinner
the
taste
which
we
had
had
made
us
ravenous
for
more
dinner
over
he
went
at
them
again
in
earnest
a
boy
riding
towards
the
railroad
with
an
important
letter
dropped
in
and
as
he
claimed
he
could
only
stop
for
a
moment
we
stood
aside
until
he
had
had
a
taste
though
he
filled
himself
like
a
poisoned
pup
after
eating
a
solid
hour
he
filled
his
pockets
and
rode
away
one
of
our
regular
men
called
after
him
tell
anybody
what
we
got
we
did
get
any
supper
that
night
not
a
man
could
have
eaten
a
bite
miller
made
him
knock
off
along
in
the
shank
of
the
evening
as
he
had
done
enough
for
any
one
day
the
next
morning
after
breakfast
he
fell
to
at
the
bear
sign
once
more
miller
rolled
a
barrel
of
flour
into
the
kitchen
from
the
storehouse
and
told
him
to
fly
at
them
how
many
do
you
think
you
want
asked
our
bear
sign
man
big
tub
full
wo
be
any
too
many
answered
miller
of
these
fellows
have
had
any
of
this
kind
of
truck
since
they
were
little
boys
if
this
gets
out
i
look
for
men
from
other
camps
the
fellow
fell
to
his
work
like
a
thoroughbred
which
he
surely
was
about
ten
two
men
rode
up
from
a
camp
to
the
north
which
the
boy
had
passed
the
day
before
with
the
letter
they
never
went
near
the
but
straight
to
the
kitchen
that
movement
showed
that
they
were
on
to
the
racket
an
hour
later
old
tom
cave
rode
in
his
horse
all
in
a
lather
all
the
way
from
garretson
camp
miles
to
the
east
the
old
sinner
said
that
he
had
been
on
the
frontier
some
little
time
and
that
there
were
the
best
bear
sign
he
had
tasted
in
forty
years
he
refused
to
take
a
stool
and
sit
down
like
civilized
folks
but
stood
up
by
the
tub
and
picked
out
the
ones
which
were
a
pale
brown
after
dinner
our
man
threw
off
his
overshirt
unbuttoned
his
red
undershirt
and
turned
it
in
until
you
could
see
the
hair
on
his
breast
rolling
up
his
sleeves
he
flew
at
his
job
once
more
he
was
getting
his
work
reduced
to
a
science
by
this
time
he
rolled
his
dough
cut
his
dough
and
turned
out
the
fine
brown
bear
sign
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
his
capacity
however
was
limited
about
two
doc
langford
and
two
of
his
peelers
were
seen
riding
up
when
he
came
into
the
kitchen
doc
swore
by
all
that
was
good
and
holy
that
he
had
heard
that
our
artist
had
come
back
to
that
country
but
any
one
that
was
noticing
could
see
him
edge
around
to
the
tub
it
was
easy
to
see
that
he
was
lying
this
luck
of
ours
was
circulating
faster
than
a
secret
amongst
women
our
man
though
stood
at
his
post
like
the
boy
on
the
burning
deck
when
night
came
on
he
had
covered
the
bottom
of
the
tub
when
he
knocked
off
doc
langford
and
his
men
gobbled
up
what
was
left
we
gave
them
a
mean
look
as
they
rode
off
but
they
came
back
the
next
day
five
strong
our
regular
men
around
camp
did
like
it
the
way
things
were
going
they
tried
to
act
polite
to
calling
bear
sign
doughnuts
interrupted
quince
forrest
reminds
me
what
will
you
kindly
hobble
your
lip
said
officer
i
have
the
floor
at
present
as
i
was
saying
they
tried
to
act
polite
to
company
that
way
but
we
had
got
a
smell
the
second
day
our
man
showed
no
signs
of
fatigue
and
told
several
good
stories
that
night
he
was
tough
the
next
day
was
christmas
but
he
had
no
respect
for
a
holiday
and
made
up
a
large
batch
of
dough
before
breakfast
it
was
a
good
thing
he
did
for
early
that
morning
john
smith
and
four
of
his
peelers
rode
in
from
the
west
their
horses
all
covered
with
frost
they
must
have
started
at
daybreak
it
was
a
good
mile
ride
they
wanted
us
to
believe
that
they
had
simply
come
over
to
spend
christmas
with
us
company
that
way
you
ca
say
anything
but
the
easy
manner
in
which
they
gravitated
around
that
tub
not
even
waiting
to
be
invited
told
a
different
tale
they
were
not
nearly
satisfied
by
noon
then
who
should
come
drifting
in
as
we
were
sitting
down
to
dinner
but
billy
dunlap
and
jim
hale
from
quinlin
camp
thirty
miles
south
on
the
cimarron
dunlap
always
holed
up
like
a
bear
in
the
winter
and
several
of
the
boys
spilled
their
coffee
at
sight
of
him
he
put
up
a
thin
excuse
just
like
the
rest
any
one
could
see
through
it
but
there
it
was
again
he
was
company
lots
of
us
had
eaten
at
his
camp
and
complained
of
his
chuck
therefore
we
were
nice
to
him
miller
called
our
man
out
behind
the
kitchen
and
told
him
to
knock
off
if
he
wanted
to
but
he
would
do
it
he
was
clean
strain
i
not
talking
dunlap
ate
hardly
any
dinner
we
noticed
and
the
very
first
batch
of
bear
sign
turned
out
he
loads
up
a
tin
plate
and
goes
out
and
sits
behind
the
storehouse
in
the
sun
all
alone
in
his
glory
he
satisfied
himself
out
of
the
tub
after
that
he
and
hale
stayed
all
night
and
dunlap
kept
every
one
awake
with
the
nightmare
yes
kept
fighting
the
demons
all
night
the
next
morning
miller
told
him
that
he
was
surprised
that
an
old
man
like
him
did
know
when
he
had
enough
but
must
gorge
himself
like
some
silly
kid
miller
told
him
that
he
was
welcome
to
stay
a
week
if
he
wanted
to
but
he
would
have
to
sleep
in
the
stable
it
was
cruel
to
the
horses
but
the
men
were
entitled
to
a
little
sleep
at
least
in
the
winter
miller
tempered
his
remarks
with
all
kindness
and
dunlap
acted
as
if
he
was
sorry
and
as
good
as
admitted
that
his
years
were
telling
on
him
that
day
our
man
filled
his
tub
he
was
simply
an
artist
on
bear
sign
calling
bear
sign
doughnuts
cut
in
quince
forrest
again
as
soon
as
he
saw
an
opening
reminds
me
what
the
little
boy
said
who
went
but
there
came
a
rumbling
of
many
hoofs
from
the
bed
ground
hell
for
you
said
half
a
dozen
men
in
a
chorus
and
every
man
in
camp
ran
for
his
horse
but
the
cook
and
he
climbed
into
the
wagon
the
roar
of
the
running
cattle
was
like
approaching
thunder
but
the
flash
from
the
of
the
men
on
guard
indicated
they
were
quartering
by
camp
heading
out
towards
the
hills
horses
became
so
excited
they
were
difficult
to
bridle
there
was
plenty
of
earnest
and
sincere
swearing
done
that
night
all
the
fine
sentiment
and
melancholy
of
the
hour
previous
vanished
in
a
moment
as
the
men
threw
themselves
into
their
saddles
riding
deep
for
it
was
uncertain
footing
to
horses
within
two
minutes
from
the
time
the
herd
left
the
bed
ground
fourteen
of
us
rode
on
their
left
point
and
across
their
front
firing
our
in
their
faces
by
the
time
the
herd
had
covered
a
scant
mile
we
had
thrown
them
into
a
mill
they
had
run
so
compactly
that
there
were
no
stragglers
so
we
loosened
out
and
gave
them
room
but
it
was
a
long
time
before
they
relaxed
any
but
continued
going
round
and
round
like
a
water
wheel
or
an
endless
chain
the
foreman
ordered
three
men
on
the
heaviest
horses
to
split
them
the
men
rode
out
a
short
distance
to
get
the
required
momentum
wheeled
their
horses
and
struck
this
sea
of
cattle
and
entered
but
it
instantly
closed
in
their
wake
as
though
it
had
been
water
for
an
hour
they
rode
through
the
herd
back
and
forth
now
from
this
quarter
now
from
that
and
finally
the
mill
was
broken
after
midnight
as
luck
would
have
it
heavy
dark
clouds
banked
in
the
northwest
and
lightning
flashed
and
before
a
single
animal
had
lain
down
a
drizzling
rain
set
in
that
settled
it
it
was
an
job
now
we
drifted
about
hither
and
yon
horses
men
and
cattle
turned
their
backs
to
the
wind
and
rain
and
waited
for
morning
we
were
so
familiar
with
the
signs
of
coming
day
that
we
turned
them
loose
half
an
hour
before
dawn
leaving
herders
and
rode
for
camp
as
we
groped
our
way
in
that
dark
hour
before
dawn
hungry
drenched
and
bedraggled
there
was
nothing
gleeful
about
us
while
bob
blades
expressed
his
disgust
over
our
occupation
if
ever
i
get
home
again
said
he
and
the
tones
of
his
voice
were
an
able
second
to
his
remarks
you
all
can
go
up
the

that
want
to

chapter

forty
islands
ford
after
securing
a
count
on
the
herd
that
morning
and
finding
nothing
short
we
trailed
out
up
the
north
platte
river
it
was
an
easy
country
in
which
to
handle
a
herd
the
trail
in
places
would
run
back
from
the
river
as
far
as
ten
miles
and
again
follow
close
in
near
the
river
bottoms
there
was
an
abundance
of
small
creeks
putting
into
this
fork
of
the
platte
from
the
south
which
afforded
water
for
the
herd
and
good
camp
grounds
at
night
only
twice
after
leaving
ogalalla
had
we
been
compelled
to
go
to
the
river
for
water
for
the
herd
and
with
the
exception
of
thunderstorms
and
occasional
summer
rains
the
weather
had
been
all
one
could
wish
for
the
past
week
as
we
trailed
up
the
north
platte
some
one
of
us
visited
the
river
daily
to
note
its
stage
of
water
for
we
were
due
to
cross
at
forty
islands
about
twelve
miles
south
of
old
fort
laramie
the
north
platte
was
very
similar
to
the
south
canadian
a
wide
sandy
stream
without
banks
and
our
experience
with
the
latter
was
fresh
in
our
memories
the
stage
of
water
had
not
been
favorable
for
this
river
also
had
its
source
in
the
mountains
and
as
now
midsummer
was
upon
us
the
season
of
heavy
rainfall
in
the
mountains
augmented
by
the
melting
snows
the
prospect
of
finding
a
fordable
stage
of
water
at
forty
islands
was
not
very
encouraging
we
reached
this
crossing
late
in
the
afternoon
the
third
day
after
leaving
the
wyoming
line
and
found
one
of
the
prairie
cattle
company
herds
this
herd
had
been
wintered
on
one
of
that
company
ranges
on
the
arkansaw
river
in
southern
colorado
and
their
destination
was
in
the
bad
lands
near
the
mouth
of
the
yellowstone
where
the
same
company
had
a
northern
range
flood
knew
the
foreman
wade
scholar
who
reported
having
been
waterbound
over
a
week
already
with
no
prospect
of
crossing
without
swimming
scholar
knew
the
country
thoroughly
and
had
decided
to
lie
over
until
the
river
was
fordable
at
forty
islands
as
it
was
much
the
easiest
crossing
on
the
north
platte
though
there
was
a
wagon
ferry
at
fort
laramie
he
returned
with
flood
to
our
camp
and
the
two
talked
over
the
prospect
of
swimming
it
on
the
morrow
let
send
the
wagons
up
to
the
ferry
in
the
morning
said
flood
and
swim
the
herds
if
you
wait
until
this
river
falls
you
are
liable
to
have
an
experience
like
we
had
on
the
south
canadian
lost
three
days
and
bogged
over
a
hundred
cattle
when
one
of
these
sandy
rivers
has
had
a
big
freshet
look
out
for
quicksands
but
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
why
we
swum
over
half
a
dozen
rivers
already
and
i
much
rather
swim
this
one
than
attempt
to
ford
it
just
after
it
has
fallen
we
can
double
our
outfits
and
be
safely
across
before
noon
i
got
nearly
a
thousand
miles
yet
to
make
and
have
just
to
get
over
think
it
over
and
have
your
wagon
ready
to
start
with
ours
scholar
rode
away
without
giving
our
foreman
any
definite
answer
as
to
what
he
would
do
though
earlier
in
the
evening
he
had
offered
to
throw
his
herd
well
out
of
the
way
at
the
ford
and
lend
us
any
assistance
at
his
command
but
when
it
came
to
the
question
of
crossing
his
own
herd
he
seemed
to
dread
the
idea
of
swimming
the
river
and
could
not
be
induced
to
say
what
he
would
do
but
said
that
we
were
welcome
to
the
lead
the
next
morning
flood
and
i
accompanied
our
wagon
up
to
his
camp
when
it
was
plainly
evident
that
he
did
not
intend
to
send
his
wagon
with
ours
and
mccann
started
on
alone
though
our
foreman
renewed
his
efforts
to
convince
scholar
of
the
feasibility
of
swimming
the
herds
their
cattle
were
thrown
well
away
from
the
ford
and
scholar
assured
us
that
his
outfit
would
be
on
hand
whenever
we
were
ready
to
cross
and
even
invited
all
hands
of
us
to
come
to
his
wagon
for
dinner
when
returning
to
our
herd
flood
told
me
that
scholar
was
considered
one
of
the
best
foremen
on
the
trail
and
why
he
should
refuse
to
swim
his
cattle
was
unexplainable
he
must
have
time
to
burn
but
that
did
seem
reasonable
for
the
earlier
through
cattle
were
turned
loose
on
their
winter
range
the
better
we
were
in
no
hurry
to
cross
as
our
wagon
would
be
gone
all
day
and
it
was
nearly
high
noon
when
we
trailed
up
to
the
ford
with
the
addition
to
our
force
of
scholar
and
nine
or
ten
of
his
men
we
had
an
abundance
of
help
and
put
the
cattle
into
the
water
opposite
two
islands
our
saddle
horses
in
the
lead
as
usual
there
was
no
swimming
water
between
the
south
shore
and
the
first
island
though
it
wet
our
saddle
skirts
for
some
considerable
distance
this
channel
being
nearly
two
hundred
yards
wide
most
of
our
outfit
took
the
water
while
scholar
men
fed
our
herd
in
from
the
south
bank
a
number
of
their
men
coming
over
as
far
as
the
first
island
the
second
island
lay
down
the
stream
some
little
distance
and
as
we
pushed
the
cattle
off
the
first
one
we
were
in
swimming
water
in
no
time
but
the
saddle
horses
were
already
landing
on
the
second
island
and
our
lead
cattle
struck
out
and
breasting
the
water
swam
as
proudly
as
swans
the
middle
channel
was
nearly
a
hundred
yards
wide
the
greater
portion
of
which
was
swimming
though
the
last
channel
was
much
wider
but
our
saddle
horses
had
already
taken
it
and
when
within
fifty
yards
of
the
farther
shore
struck
solid
footing
with
our
own
outfit
we
crowded
the
leaders
to
keep
the
chain
of
cattle
unbroken
and
before
honeyman
could
hustle
his
horses
out
of
the
river
our
lead
cattle
had
caught
a
foothold
were
heading
up
stream
and
edging
out
for
the
farther
shore
i
had
one
of
the
best
swimming
horses
in
our
outfit
and
flood
put
me
in
the
lead
on
the
point
as
my
horse
came
out
on
the
farther
bank
i
am
certain
i
never
have
seen
a
herd
of
cattle
before
or
since
which
presented
a
prettier
sight
when
swimming
than
ours
did
that
day
there
was
fully
four
hundred
yards
of
water
on
the
angle
by
which
we
crossed
nearly
half
of
which
was
swimming
but
with
the
two
islands
which
gave
them
a
breathing
spell
our
circle
dots
were
taking
the
water
as
steadily
as
a
herd
leaving
their
bed
ground
scholar
and
his
men
were
feeding
them
in
while
half
a
dozen
of
our
men
on
each
island
were
keeping
them
moving
honeyman
and
i
pointed
them
out
of
the
river
and
as
they
grazed
away
from
the
shore
they
spread
out
many
of
them
kicking
up
their
heels
after
they
left
the
water
in
healthy
enjoyment
of
their
bath
long
before
they
were
half
over
the
usual
shouting
had
ceased
and
we
simply
sat
in
our
saddles
and
waited
for
the
long
train
of
cattle
to
come
up
and
cross
within
less
than
half
an
hour
from
the
time
our
saddle
horses
entered
the
north
platte
the
tail
end
of
our
herd
had
landed
safely
on
the
farther
bank
illustration
swimming
the
platte
as
honeyman
and
i
were
the
only
ones
of
our
outfit
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
during
the
passage
flood
called
to
us
from
across
the
last
channel
to
graze
the
herd
until
relieved
when
the
remainder
of
the
outfit
returned
to
the
south
side
to
recover
their
discarded
effects
and
to
get
dinner
with
scholar
wagon
i
had
imitated
honeyman
and
tied
my
boots
to
my
cantle
strings
so
that
my
effects
were
on
the
right
side
of
the
river
and
as
far
as
dinner
was
concerned
well
i
much
rather
miss
it
than
swim
the
platte
twice
in
its
then
stage
of
water
there
is
a
difference
in
daring
in
duty
and
in
daring
out
of
pure
venturesomeness
and
if
we
missed
our
dinners
it
would
not
be
the
first
time
so
we
were
quite
willing
to
make
the
sacrifice
if
the
quirk
family
never
achieve
fame
for
daring
by
field
and
flood
until
this
one
of
the
old
man
boys
brings
the
family
name
into
prominence
it
will
be
hopelessly
lost
to
posterity
we
allowed
the
cattle
to
graze
of
their
own
free
will
and
merely
turned
in
the
sides
and
rear
but
on
reaching
the
second
bottom
of
the
river
where
they
caught
a
good
breeze
they
lay
down
for
their
noonday
siesta
which
relieved
us
of
all
work
but
keeping
watch
over
them
the
saddle
horses
were
grazing
about
in
plain
view
on
the
first
bottom
so
honeyman
and
i
dismounted
on
a
little
elevation
overlooking
our
charges
we
were
expecting
the
outfit
to
return
promptly
after
dinner
was
over
for
it
was
early
enough
in
the
day
to
have
trailed
eight
or
ten
miles
farther
it
would
have
been
no
trouble
to
send
some
one
up
the
river
to
meet
our
wagon
and
pilot
mccann
to
the
herd
for
the
trail
left
on
a
line
due
north
from
the
river
we
had
been
lounging
about
for
an
hour
while
the
cattle
were
resting
when
our
attention
was
attracted
by
our
saddle
horses
in
the
bottom
they
were
looking
at
the
ford
to
which
we
supposed
their
attention
had
been
attracted
by
the
swimming
of
the
outfit
but
instead
only
two
of
the
boys
showed
up
and
on
sighting
us
nearly
a
mile
away
they
rode
forward
very
leisurely
before
their
arrival
we
recognized
them
by
their
horses
as
ash
borrowstone
and
rod
wheat
and
on
their
riding
up
the
latter
said
as
he
dismounted
well
they
going
to
cross
the
other
herd
and
they
want
you
to
come
back
and
point
the
cattle
with
that
famous
swimming
horse
of
yours
you
learn
after
a
while
not
to
blow
so
much
about
your
mount
and
your
cutting
horses
and
your
night
horses
and
your
swimming
horses
i
wish
every
horse
of
mine
had
a
nigger
brand
on
him
and
i
had
to
ride
in
the
wagon
when
it
comes
to
swimming
these
rivers
and
i
not
the
only
one
that
has
a
distaste
for
a
wet
proposition
for
i
would
have
to
guess
twice
as
to
what
the
matter
with
scholar
but
flood
has
pounded
him
on
the
back
ever
since
he
met
him
yesterday
evening
to
swim
his
cattle
until
it
either
swim
or
say
he
afraid
to
it
luke
or
give
up
the
with
him
scholar
a
nice
fellow
but
i
bet
my
interest
in
goose
heaven
that
i
know
what
the
matter
with
him
and
i
not
blaming
him
either
but
i
ca
understand
why
our
boss
should
take
such
an
interest
in
having
him
swim
it
none
of
his
business
if
he
swims
now
or
fords
a
month
hence
or
waits
until
the
river
freezes
over
in
the
winter
and
crosses
on
the
ice
but
let
the
big
augers
wrangle
it
out
you
noticed
ash
that
riot
one
of
scholar
outfit
ever
said
a
word
one
way
or
the
other
but
flood
poured
it
into
him
until
he
consented
to
swim
so
fork
that
swimming
horse
of
yours
and
wet
your
big
toe
again
in
the
north
platte
as
the
orders
had
come
from
the
foreman
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
obey
honeyman
rode
as
far
as
the
river
with
me
where
after
shedding
my
boots
and
surplus
clothing
and
secreting
them
i
rode
up
above
the
island
and
plunged
in
i
was
riding
the
gray
which
i
had
tried
in
the
rio
grande
the
day
we
received
the
herd
and
now
that
i
understood
handling
him
better
i
preferred
him
to
nigger
boy
my
night
horse
we
took
the
first
and
second
islands
with
but
a
blowing
spell
between
and
when
i
reached
the
farther
shore
i
turned
in
my
saddle
and
saw
honeyman
wave
his
hat
to
me
in
congratulation
on
reaching
their
wagon
i
found
the
herd
was
swinging
around
about
a
mile
out
from
the
river
in
order
to
get
a
straight
shoot
for
the
entrance
at
the
ford
i
hurriedly
swallowed
my
dinner
and
as
we
rode
out
to
meet
the
herd
asked
flood
if
scholar
were
not
going
to
send
his
wagon
up
to
the
ferry
to
cross
for
there
was
as
yet
no
indication
of
it
flood
replied
that
scholar
expected
to
go
with
the
wagon
as
he
needed
some
supplies
which
he
thought
he
could
get
from
the
sutler
at
fort
laramie
flood
ordered
me
to
take
the
lower
point
again
and
i
rode
across
the
trail
and
took
my
place
when
the
herd
came
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
river
while
the
remainder
of
the
outfit
took
positions
near
the
lead
on
the
lower
side
it
was
a
slightly
larger
herd
than
ours
all
steers
that
reflected
in
their
glossy
coats
the
benefits
of
a
northern
winter
as
we
came
up
to
the
edge
it
required
two
of
their
men
to
force
their
into
the
water
though
it
was
much
smaller
than
ours
six
horses
to
the
man
but
better
ones
than
ours
being
northern
wintered
the
cattle
were
well
and
followed
the
leadership
of
the
saddle
horses
nicely
to
the
first
island
but
they
would
have
balked
at
this
second
channel
had
it
not
been
for
the
amount
of
help
at
hand
we
lined
them
out
however
and
they
breasted
the
current
and
landed
on
the
second
island
the
saddle
horses
gave
some
little
trouble
on
leaving
for
the
farther
shore
and
before
they
were
got
off
several
hundred
head
of
cattle
had
landed
on
the
island
but
they
handled
obediently
and
were
soon
trailing
out
upon
terra
firma
the
herd
following
across
without
a
broken
link
in
the
chain
there
was
nothing
now
to
do
but
keep
the
train
moving
into
the
water
on
the
south
bank
see
that
they
did
not
congest
on
the
islands
and
that
they
left
the
river
on
reaching
the
farther
shore
when
the
saddle
horses
reached
the
farther
bank
they
were
thrown
up
the
river
and
turned
loose
so
that
the
two
men
would
be
available
to
hold
the
herd
after
it
left
the
water
i
had
crossed
with
the
first
lead
cattle
to
the
farther
shore
and
was
turning
them
up
the
river
as
fast
as
they
struck
solid
footing
on
that
side
but
several
times
i
was
compelled
to
swim
back
to
the
nearest
island
and
return
with
large
bunches
which
had
hesitated
to
take
the
last
channel
the
two
outfits
were
working
promiscuously
together
and
i
never
knew
who
was
the
directing
spirit
in
the
work
but
when
the
last
two
or
three
hundred
of
the
were
leaving
the
first
island
for
the
second
and
the
men
working
in
the
rear
started
to
swim
the
channel
amid
the
general
hilarity
i
recognized
a
shout
that
was
born
of
fear
and
terror
a
hushed
silence
fell
over
the
riotous
riders
in
the
river
and
i
saw
those
on
the
sand
bar
nearest
my
side
rush
down
the
narrow
island
and
plunge
back
into
the
middle
channel
then
it
dawned
on
my
mind
in
a
flash
that
some
one
had
lost
his
seat
and
that
terrified
cry
was
for
help
i
plunged
my
gray
into
the
river
and
swam
to
the
first
bar
and
from
thence
to
the
scene
of
the
trouble
horses
and
men
were
drifting
with
the
current
down
the
channel
and
as
i
appealed
to
the
men
i
could
get
no
answer
but
their
blanched
faces
though
it
was
plain
in
every
countenance
that
one
of
our
number
was
under
water
if
not
drowned
there
were
not
less
than
twenty
horsemen
drifting
in
the
middle
channel
in
the
hope
that
whoever
it
was
would
come
to
the
surface
and
a
hand
could
be
stretched
out
in
succor
about
two
hundred
yards
down
the
river
was
an
island
near
the
middle
of
the
stream
the
current
carried
us
near
it
and
on
landing
i
learned
that
the
unfortunate
man
was
none
other
than
wade
scholar
the
foreman
of
the
herd
we
scattered
up
and
down
this
middle
island
and
watched
every
ripple
and
floating
bit
of
flotsam
in
the
hope
that
he
would
come
to
the
surface
but
nothing
but
his
hat
was
seen
in
the
disorder
into
which
the
outfits
were
thrown
by
this
accident
flood
first
regained
his
thinking
faculties
and
ordered
a
few
of
us
to
cross
to
either
bank
and
ride
down
the
river
and
take
up
positions
on
the
other
islands
from
which
that
part
of
the
river
took
its
name
a
hundred
conjectures
were
offered
as
to
how
it
occurred
but
no
one
saw
either
horse
or
rider
after
sinking
a
free
horse
would
be
hard
to
drown
and
on
the
nonappearance
of
scholar
mount
it
was
concluded
that
he
must
have
become
entangled
in
the
reins
or
that
scholar
had
clutched
them
in
his
death
grip
and
horse
and
man
thus
met
death
together
it
was
believed
by
his
own
outfit
that
scholar
had
no
intention
until
the
last
moment
to
risk
swimming
the
river
but
when
he
saw
all
the
others
plunge
into
the
channel
his
better
judgment
was
overcome
and
rather
than
remain
behind
and
cause
comment
he
had
followed
and
lost
his
life
we
patrolled
the
river
until
darkness
without
result
the
two
herds
in
the
mean
time
having
been
so
neglected
that
they
had
mixed
our
wagon
returned
along
the
north
bank
early
in
the
evening
and
flood
ordered
priest
to
go
in
and
make
up
a
guard
from
the
two
outfits
and
hold
the
herd
for
the
night
some
one
of
scholar
outfit
went
back
and
moved
their
wagon
up
to
the
crossing
within
hailing
distance
of
ours
it
was
a
night
of
muffled
conversation
and
every
voice
of
the
night
or
cry
of
waterfowl
in
the
river
sent
creepy
sensations
over
us
the
long
night
passed
however
and
the
sun
rose
in
sabbath
benediction
for
it
was
sunday
and
found
groups
of
men
huddled
around
two
wagons
in
silent
contemplation
of
what
the
day
before
had
brought
a
more
broken
and
disconsolate
set
of
men
than
scholar
would
be
hard
to
imagine
flood
inquired
of
their
outfit
if
there
was
any
or
as
they
were
generally
called
it
seemed
there
was
not
but
their
outfit
was
unanimous
that
the
leadership
should
fall
to
a
boyhood
acquaintance
of
scholar
by
the
name
of
campbell
who
was
generally
addressed
as
black
jim
flood
at
once
advised
campbell
to
send
their
wagon
up
to
laramie
and
cross
it
promising
that
we
would
lie
over
that
day
and
make
an
effort
to
recover
the
body
of
the
drowned
foreman
campbell
accordingly
started
his
wagon
up
to
the
ferry
and
all
the
remainder
of
the
outfits
with
the
exception
of
a
few
men
on
herd
started
out
in
search
of
the
drowned
man
within
a
mile
and
a
half
below
the
ford
there
were
located
over
thirty
of
the
forty
islands
and
at
the
lower
end
of
this
chain
of
sand
bars
we
began
and
searched
both
shores
while
three
or
four
men
swam
to
each
island
and
made
a
vigorous
search
the
water
in
the
river
was
not
very
clear
which
called
for
a
close
inspection
but
with
a
force
of
men
in
the
hunt
we
covered
island
and
shore
rapidly
in
our
search
it
was
about
eight
in
the
morning
and
we
had
already
searched
half
of
the
islands
when
joe
stallings
and
two
of
scholar
men
swam
to
an
island
in
the
river
which
had
a
growth
of
small
cottonwoods
covering
it
while
on
the
upper
end
was
a
heavy
lodgment
of
driftwood
john
officer
the
rebel
and
i
had
taken
the
next
island
above
and
as
we
were
riding
the
shallows
surrounding
it
we
heard
a
shot
in
our
rear
that
told
us
the
body
had
been
found
as
we
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
signal
stallings
was
standing
on
a
large
driftwood
log
and
signaling
we
started
back
to
him
partly
wading
and
partly
swimming
while
from
both
sides
of
the
river
men
were
swimming
their
horses
for
the
brushy
island
our
squad
on
nearing
the
lower
bar
was
compelled
to
swim
around
the
driftwood
and
some
twelve
or
fifteen
men
from
either
shore
reached
the
scene
before
us
the
body
was
lying
face
upward
in
about
eighteen
inches
of
eddy
water
flood
and
campbell
waded
out
and
taking
a
lariat
fastened
it
around
his
chest
under
the
arms
then
flood
noticing
i
was
riding
my
black
asked
me
to
tow
the
body
ashore
forcing
a
passage
through
the
driftwood
i
took
the
loose
end
of
the
lariat
and
started
for
the
north
bank
the
double
outfit
following
on
reaching
the
shore
the
body
was
carried
out
of
the
water
by
willing
hands
and
one
of
our
outfit
was
sent
to
the
wagon
for
a
tarpaulin
to
be
used
as
a
stretcher
meanwhile
campbell
took
possession
of
the
drowned
foreman
watch
purse
and
papers
the
watch
was
as
good
as
ruined
but
the
leather
holster
had
shrunk
and
securely
held
the
gun
from
being
lost
in
the
river
on
the
arrival
of
the
tarpaulin
the
body
was
laid
upon
it
and
four
mounted
men
taking
the
four
corners
of
the
sheet
wrapped
them
on
the
pommels
of
their
saddles
and
started
for
our
wagon
when
the
corpse
had
been
lowered
to
the
ground
at
our
camp
a
look
of
inquiry
passed
from
face
to
face
which
seemed
to
ask
what
next
but
the
inquiry
was
answered
a
moment
later
by
black
jim
campbell
the
friend
of
the
dead
man
memory
may
have
dimmed
the
lesser
details
of
that
sunday
morning
on
the
north
platte
for
over
two
decades
have
since
gone
but
his
words
and
manliness
have
lived
not
only
in
my
mind
but
in
the
memory
of
every
other
survivor
of
those
present
this
accident
said
he
in
perfect
composure
as
he
gazed
into
the
calm
still
face
of
his
dead
friend
will
impose
on
me
a
very
sad
duty
i
expect
to
meet
his
mother
some
day
she
will
want
to
know
everything
i
must
tell
her
the
truth
and
i
hate
to
tell
her
we
buried
him
like
a
dog
for
she
a
christian
woman
and
what
makes
it
all
the
harder
i
know
that
this
is
the
third
boy
she
has
lost
by
drowning
some
of
you
may
not
have
understood
him
but
among
those
papers
which
you
saw
me
take
from
his
pockets
was
a
letter
from
his
mother
in
which
she
warned
him
to
guard
against
just
what
has
happened
situated
as
we
are
i
going
to
ask
you
all
to
help
me
give
him
the
best
burial
we
can
no
doubt
it
will
be
crude
but
it
will
be
some
solace
to
her
to
know
we
did
the
best
we
could
every
one
of
us
was
eager
to
lend
his
assistance
within
five
minutes
priest
was
galloping
up
the
north
bank
of
the
river
to
intercept
the
wagon
at
the
ferry
a
purse
in
his
pocket
with
which
to
secure
a
coffin
at
fort
laramie
flood
and
campbell
selected
a
burial
place
and
with
our
wagon
spade
a
grave
was
being
dug
on
a
grassy
mound
where
there
were
two
other
graves
there
was
not
a
man
among
us
who
was
hypocrite
enough
to
attempt
to
conduct
a
christian
burial
service
but
when
the
subject
came
up
mccann
said
as
he
came
down
the
river
the
evening
before
he
noticed
an
emigrant
train
of
about
thirty
wagons
going
into
camp
at
a
grove
about
five
miles
up
the
river
in
a
conversation
which
he
had
had
with
one
of
the
party
he
learned
that
they
expected
to
rest
over
sunday
their
respect
for
the
sabbath
day
caused
campbell
to
suggest
that
there
might
be
some
one
in
the
emigrant
camp
who
could
conduct
a
christian
burial
and
he
at
once
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
away
to
learn
in
preparing
the
body
for
its
last
we
were
badly
handicapped
but
by
tearing
a
new
wagon
sheet
into
strips
about
a
foot
in
width
and
wrapping
the
body
we
gave
it
a
humble
bier
in
the
shade
of
our
wagon
pending
the
arrival
of
the
coffin
the
features
were
so
ashened
by
having
been
submerged
in
the
river
for
over
eighteen
hours
that
we
wrapped
the
face
also
as
we
preferred
to
remember
him
as
we
had
seen
him
the
day
before
strong
healthy
and
buoyant
during
the
interim
awaiting
the
return
of
campbell
from
the
emigrant
camp
and
of
the
wagon
we
sat
around
in
groups
and
discussed
the
incident
there
was
a
sense
of
guilt
expressed
by
a
number
of
our
outfit
over
their
hasty
decision
regarding
the
courage
of
the
dead
man
when
we
understood
that
two
of
his
brothers
had
met
a
similar
fate
in
red
river
within
the
past
five
years
every
guilty
thought
or
hasty
word
spoken
came
back
to
us
with
tenfold
weight
priest
and
campbell
returned
together
the
former
reported
having
secured
a
coffin
which
would
arrive
within
an
hour
while
the
latter
had
met
in
the
emigrant
camp
a
superannuated
minister
who
gladly
volunteered
his
services
he
had
given
the
old
minister
such
data
as
he
had
and
two
of
the
minister
granddaughters
had
expressed
a
willingness
to
assist
by
singing
at
the
burial
services
campbell
had
set
the
hour
for
four
and
several
conveyances
would
be
down
from
the
emigrant
camp
the
wagon
arriving
shortly
afterward
we
had
barely
time
to
lay
the
corpse
in
the
coffin
before
the
emigrants
drove
up
the
minister
was
a
tall
homely
man
with
a
flowing
beard
which
the
frosts
of
many
a
winter
had
whitened
and
as
he
mingled
amongst
us
in
the
final
preparations
he
had
a
kind
word
for
every
one
there
were
ten
in
his
party
and
when
the
coffin
had
been
carried
out
to
the
grave
the
two
granddaughters
of
the
old
man
opened
the
simple
service
by
singing
very
impressively
the
first
three
verses
of
the
portuguese
hymn
i
had
heard
the
old
hymn
sung
often
before
but
the
impression
of
the
last
verse
rang
in
my
ears
for
days
afterward
when
through
the
deep
waters
i
call
thee
to
go
the
rivers
of
sorrow
shall
not
overflow
for
i
will
be
with
thee
thy
troubles
to
bless
and
sanctify
to
thee
thy
deepest
distress
as
the
notes
of
the
hymn
died
away
there
was
for
a
few
moments
profound
stillness
and
not
a
move
was
made
by
any
one
the
touching
words
of
the
old
hymn
expressed
quite
vividly
the
disaster
of
the
previous
day
and
awakened
in
us
many
memories
of
home
for
a
time
we
were
silent
while
eyes
unused
to
weeping
filled
with
tears
i
do
not
know
how
long
we
remained
so
it
may
have
been
only
for
a
moment
it
probably
was
but
i
do
know
the
silence
was
not
broken
till
the
aged
minister
who
stood
at
the
head
of
the
coffin
began
his
discourse
we
stood
with
uncovered
heads
during
the
service
and
when
the
old
minister
addressed
us
he
spoke
as
though
he
might
have
been
holding
family
worship
and
we
had
been
his
children
he
invoked
heaven
to
comfort
and
sustain
the
mother
when
the
news
of
her
son
death
reached
her
as
she
would
need
more
than
human
aid
in
that
hour
he
prayed
that
her
faith
might
not
falter
and
that
she
might
again
meet
and
be
with
her
loved
ones
forever
in
the
great
beyond
he
then
took
up
the
subject
of
life
spoke
of
its
brevity
its
many
hopes
that
are
never
realized
and
the
disappointments
from
which
no
prudence
or
foresight
can
shield
us
he
dwelt
at
some
length
on
the
strange
mingling
of
sunshine
and
shadow
that
seemed
to
belong
to
every
life
on
the
mystery
everywhere
and
nowhere
more
impressively
than
in
ourselves
with
his
long
bony
finger
he
pointed
to
the
cold
mute
form
that
lay
in
the
coffin
before
us
and
said
but
this
my
friends
is
the
mystery
of
all
mysteries
the
fact
that
life
terminated
in
death
he
said
only
emphasized
its
reality
that
the
death
of
our
companion
was
not
an
accident
though
it
was
sudden
and
unexpected
that
the
difficulties
of
life
are
such
that
it
would
be
worse
than
folly
in
us
to
try
to
meet
them
in
our
own
strength
death
he
said
might
change
but
it
did
not
destroy
that
the
soul
still
lived
and
would
live
forever
that
death
was
simply
the
gateway
out
of
time
into
eternity
and
if
we
were
to
realize
the
high
aim
of
our
being
we
could
do
so
by
casting
our
burdens
on
him
who
was
able
and
willing
to
carry
them
for
us
he
spoke
feelingly
of
the
great
teacher
the
lowly
nazarene
who
also
suffered
and
died
and
he
concluded
with
an

at

chapter
xx
a
moonlight
drive
the
two
herds
were
held
together
a
second
night
but
after
they
had
grazed
a
few
hours
the
next
morning
the
cattle
were
thrown
together
and
the
work
of
cutting
out
ours
commenced
with
a
double
outfit
of
men
available
about
twenty
men
were
turned
into
the
herd
to
do
the
cutting
the
remainder
holding
the
main
herd
and
looking
after
the
cut
the
morning
was
cool
every
one
worked
with
a
vim
and
in
about
two
hours
the
herds
were
again
separated
and
ready
for
the
final
trimming
campbell
did
not
expect
to
move
out
until
he
could
communicate
with
the
head
office
of
the
company
and
would
go
up
to
fort
laramie
for
that
purpose
during
the
day
hoping
to
be
able
to
get
a
message
over
the
military
wire
when
his
outfit
had
finished
retrimming
our
herd
and
we
had
looked
over
his
cattle
for
the
last
time
the
two
outfits
bade
each
other
farewell
and
our
herd
started
on
its
journey
the
unfortunate
accident
at
the
ford
had
depressed
our
feelings
to
such
an
extent
that
there
was
an
entire
absence
of
hilarity
by
the
way
this
morning
the
farewell
songs
generally
used
in
parting
with
a
river
which
had
defied
us
were
omitted
the
herd
trailed
out
like
an
immense
serpent
and
was
guided
and
controlled
by
our
men
as
if
by
mutes
long
before
the
noon
hour
we
passed
out
of
sight
of
forty
islands
and
in
the
next
few
days
with
the
change
of
scene
the
gloom
gradually
lifted
we
were
bearing
almost
due
north
and
passing
through
a
delightful
country
to
our
left
ran
a
range
of
mountains
while
on
the
other
hand
sloped
off
the
apparently
limitless
plain
the
scarcity
of
water
was
beginning
to
be
felt
for
the
streams
which
had
not
a
source
in
the
mountains
on
our
left
had
dried
up
weeks
before
our
arrival
there
was
a
gradual
change
of
air
noticeable
too
for
we
were
rapidly
gaining
altitude
the
heat
of
summer
being
now
confined
to
a
few
hours
at
noonday
while
the
nights
were
almost
too
cool
for
our
comfort
when
about
three
days
out
from
the
north
platte
the
mountains
disappeared
on
our
left
while
on
the
other
hand
appeared
a
country
which
we
knew
must
be
the
approaches
of
the
black
hills
another
day
drive
brought
us
into
the
main
stage
road
connecting
the
railroad
on
the
south
with
the
mining
camps
which
nestled
somewhere
in
those
rocky
hills
to
our
right
the
stage
road
followed
the
trail
some
ten
or
fifteen
miles
before
we
parted
company
with
it
on
a
dry
fork
of
the
big
cheyenne
river
there
was
a
road
house
and
stage
stand
where
these
two
thoroughfares
separated
the
one
to
the
mining
camp
of
deadwood
while
ours
of
the
montana
cattle
trail
bore
off
for
the
powder
river
to
the
northwest
at
this
stage
stand
we
learned
that
some
twenty
herds
had
already
passed
by
to
the
northern
ranges
and
that
after
passing
the
next
fork
of
the
big
cheyenne
we
should
find
no
water
until
we
struck
the
powder
river
a
stretch
of
eighty
miles
the
keeper
of
the
road
house
a
genial
host
informed
us
that
this
drouthy
stretch
in
our
front
was
something
unusual
this
being
one
of
the
dryest
summers
that
he
had
experienced
since
the
discovery
of
gold
in
the
black
hills
here
was
a
new
situation
to
be
met
an
dry
drive
and
with
our
experience
of
a
few
months
before
at
indian
lakes
fresh
in
our
memories
we
set
our
house
in
order
for
the
undertaking
before
us
it
was
yet
fifteen
miles
to
the
next
and
last
water
from
the
stage
stand
there
were
several
dry
forks
of
the
cheyenne
beyond
but
as
they
had
their
source
in
the
tablelands
of
wyoming
we
could
not
hope
for
water
in
their
dry
bottoms
the
situation
was
serious
with
only
this
encouragement
other
herds
had
crossed
this
arid
belt
since
the
streams
had
dried
up
and
our
circle
dots
could
walk
with
any
herd
that
ever
left
texas
the
wisdom
of
mounting
us
well
for
just
such
an
emergency
reflected
the
good
cow
sense
of
our
employer
and
we
felt
easy
in
regard
to
our
mounts
though
there
was
not
a
horse
or
a
man
too
many
in
summing
up
the
situation
flood
said
we
got
this
advantage
over
the
indian
lake
drive
there
is
a
good
moon
and
the
days
are
cool
we
make
miles
a
day
covering
this
stretch
as
this
herd
has
never
been
put
to
a
test
yet
to
see
how
far
they
could
walk
in
a
day
they
have
to
do
their
sleeping
at
noon
at
least
cut
it
into
two
shifts
and
if
we
get
any
sleep
we
have
to
do
the
same
let
her
come
as
she
will
every
day
drive
is
a
day
nearer
the
blackfoot
agency
we
made
a
dry
camp
that
night
on
the
divide
between
the
road
house
and
the
last
water
and
the
next
forenoon
reached
the
south
fork
of
the
big
cheyenne
the
water
was
not
even
running
in
it
but
there
were
several
long
pools
and
we
held
the
cattle
around
them
for
over
an
hour
until
every
hoof
had
been
thoroughly
watered
mccann
had
filled
every
keg
and
canteen
in
advance
of
the
arrival
of
the
herd
and
flood
had
exercised
sufficient
caution
in
view
of
what
lay
before
us
to
buy
an
extra
keg
and
a
lantern
at
the
road
house
after
watering
we
trailed
out
some
four
or
five
miles
and
camped
for
noon
but
the
herd
were
allowed
to
graze
forward
until
they
lay
down
for
their
noonday
rest
as
the
herd
passed
opposite
the
wagon
we
cut
a
fat
stray
heifer
and
killed
her
for
beef
for
the
inner
man
must
be
fortified
for
the
journey
before
us
after
a
two
siesta
we
threw
the
herd
on
the
trail
and
started
on
our
way
the
wagon
and
saddle
horses
were
held
in
our
immediate
rear
for
there
was
no
telling
when
or
where
we
would
make
our
next
halt
of
any
consequence
we
trailed
and
grazed
the
herd
alternately
until
near
evening
when
the
wagon
was
sent
on
ahead
about
three
miles
to
get
supper
while
half
the
outfit
went
along
to
change
mounts
and
catch
up
horses
for
those
remaining
behind
with
the
herd
a
half
hour
before
the
usual
bedding
time
the
relieved
men
returned
and
took
the
grazing
herd
and
the
others
rode
in
to
the
wagon
for
supper
and
a
change
of
mounts
while
we
shifted
our
saddles
we
smelled
the
savory
odor
of
fresh
beef
frying
listen
to
that
good
old
beef
talking
will
you
said
joe
stallings
as
he
was
bridling
his
horse
mccann
i
take
my
a
trifle
rare
garnished
with
a
sprig
of
parsley
and
a
wee
bit
of
lemon
before
we
had
finished
supper
honeyman
had
rehooked
the
mules
to
the
wagon
while
the
was
at
hand
to
follow
before
we
left
the
wagon
a
full
moon
was
rising
on
the
eastern
horizon
and
as
we
were
starting
out
flood
gave
us
these
general
directions
i
going
to
take
the
lead
with
the
cook
lantern
and
one
of
you
rear
men
take
the
new
we
throw
the
herd
on
the
trail
and
between
the
lead
and
rear
light
you
swing
men
want
to
ride
well
outside
and
you
point
men
want
to
hold
the
lead
cattle
so
the
rear
will
never
be
more
than
a
half
a
mile
behind
i
admit
that
this
is
somewhat
of
an
experiment
with
me
but
i
do
see
any
good
reason
why
she
work
after
the
moon
gets
another
hour
high
we
can
see
a
quarter
of
a
mile
and
the
cattle
are
so
well
trail
broke
they
never
try
to
scatter
if
it
works
all
right
we
never
bed
them
short
of
midnight
and
that
will
put
us
ten
miles
farther
let
ride
lads
by
the
time
the
herd
was
eased
back
on
the
trail
our
evening
had
been
passed
while
the
cattle
led
out
as
if
walking
on
a
wager
after
the
first
mile
on
the
trail
the
men
on
the
point
were
compelled
to
ride
in
the
lead
if
we
were
to
hold
them
within
the
desired
half
mile
the
men
on
the
other
side
or
the
swing
were
gradually
widening
until
the
herd
must
have
reached
fully
a
mile
in
length
yet
we
swing
riders
were
never
out
of
sight
of
each
other
and
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
any
cattle
to
leave
the
herd
unnoticed
in
that
moonlight
the
trail
was
as
plain
as
day
and
after
an
hour
flood
turned
his
lantern
over
to
one
of
the
point
men
and
rode
back
around
the
herd
to
the
rear
from
my
position
that
first
night
near
the
middle
of
the
swing
the
lanterns
both
rear
and
forward
being
always
in
sight
i
was
as
much
at
sea
as
any
one
as
to
the
length
of
the
herd
knowing
the
deceitfulness
of
distance
of
campfires
and
other
lights
by
night
the
foreman
appealed
to
me
as
he
rode
down
the
column
to
know
the
length
of
the
herd
but
i
could
give
him
no
more
than
a
simple
guess
i
could
assure
him
however
that
the
cattle
had
made
no
effort
to
drop
out
and
leave
the
trail
but
a
short
time
after
he
passed
me
i
noticed
a
horseman
galloping
up
the
column
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
herd
and
knew
it
must
be
the
foreman
within
a
short
time
some
one
in
the
lead
his
lantern
it
was
answered
by
the
light
in
the
rear
and
the
next
minute
the
old
rear
song
go
little
doggie
you
make
a
reached
us
riders
in
the
swing
and
we
knew
the
rear
guard
of
cattle
was
being
pushed
forward
the
distance
between
the
swing
men
gradually
narrowed
in
our
lead
from
which
we
could
tell
the
leaders
were
being
held
in
until
several
times
cattle
grazed
out
from
the
herd
due
to
the
checking
in
front
at
this
juncture
flood
galloped
around
the
herd
a
second
time
and
as
he
passed
us
riding
along
our
side
i
appealed
to
him
to
let
them
go
in
front
as
it
now
required
constant
riding
to
keep
the
cattle
from
leaving
the
trail
to
graze
when
he
passed
up
the
opposite
side
i
could
distinctly
hear
the
men
on
that
flank
making
a
similar
appeal
and
shortly
afterwards
the
herd
loosened
out
and
we
struck
our
old
gait
for
several
hours
trailing
by
moonlight
was
a
novelty
to
all
of
us
and
in
the
stillness
of
those
splendid
july
nights
we
could
hear
the
point
men
chatting
across
the
lead
in
front
while
well
in
the
rear
the
rattling
of
our
heavily
loaded
wagon
and
the
whistling
of
the
horse
wrangler
to
his
charges
reached
our
ears
the
swing
men
were
scattered
so
far
apart
there
was
no
chance
for
conversation
amongst
us
but
every
once
in
a
while
a
song
would
be
started
and
as
it
surged
up
and
down
the
line
every
voice
good
bad
and
indifferent
joined
in
singing
is
supposed
to
have
a
soothing
effect
on
cattle
though
i
will
vouch
for
the
fact
that
none
of
our
circle
dots
stopped
that
night
to
listen
to
our
vocal
efforts
the
herd
was
traveling
so
nicely
that
our
foreman
hardly
noticed
the
passing
hours
but
along
about
midnight
the
singing
ceased
and
we
were
nodding
in
our
saddles
and
wondering
if
they
in
the
lead
were
never
going
to
throw
off
the
trail
when
a
great
occurred
in
front
and
presently
we
overtook
the
rebel
holding
the
lantern
and
turning
the
herd
out
of
the
trail
it
was
then
after
midnight
and
within
another
half
hour
we
had
the
cattle
bedded
down
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
trail
guards
was
the
order
of
the
night
and
as
soon
as
our
wagon
and
saddle
horses
came
up
we
stretched
ropes
and
caught
out
our
night
horses
these
we
either
tied
to
the
wagon
wheels
or
picketed
near
at
hand
and
then
we
sought
our
blankets
for
a
few
hours
sleep
it
was
half
past
three
in
the
morning
when
our
guard
was
called
and
before
the
hour
passed
the
first
signs
of
day
were
visible
in
the
east
but
even
before
our
watch
had
ended
flood
and
the
last
guard
came
to
our
relief
and
we
pushed
the
sleeping
cattle
off
the
bed
ground
and
started
them
grazing
forward
cattle
will
not
graze
freely
in
a
heavy
dew
or
too
early
in
the
morning
and
before
the
sun
was
high
enough
to
dry
the
grass
we
had
put
several
miles
behind
us
when
the
sun
was
about
an
hour
high
the
remainder
of
the
outfit
overtook
us
and
shortly
afterward
the
wagon
and
saddle
horses
passed
on
up
the
trail
from
which
it
was
evident
that
breakfast
would
be
served
in
the
dining
car
ahead
as
the
traveled
priest
aptly
put
it
after
the
sun
was
well
up
the
cattle
grazed
freely
for
several
hours
but
when
we
sighted
the
and
our
commissary
some
two
miles
in
our
lead
flood
ordered
the
herd
lined
up
for
a
count
the
rebel
was
always
a
reliable
counter
and
he
and
the
foreman
now
rode
forward
and
selected
the
crossing
of
a
dry
wash
for
the
counting
on
receiving
their
signal
to
come
on
we
allowed
the
herd
to
graze
slowly
forward
but
gradually
pointed
them
into
an
immense
v
and
as
the
point
of
the
herd
crossed
the
dry
arroyo
we
compelled
them
to
pass
in
a
narrow
file
between
the
two
counters
when
they
again
spread
out
and
continued
their
feeding
the
count
confirmed
the
success
of
our
driving
by
night
and
on
its
completion
all
but
two
men
rode
to
the
wagon
for
breakfast
by
the
time
the
morning
meal
was
disposed
of
the
herd
had
come
up
parallel
with
the
wagon
but
a
mile
to
the
westward
and
as
fast
as
fresh
mounts
could
be
saddled
we
rode
away
in
small
squads
to
relieve
the
herders
and
to
turn
the
cattle
into
the
trail
it
was
but
a
little
after
eight
in
the
morning
when
the
herd
was
again
trailing
out
on
the
powder
river
trail
and
we
had
already
put
over
thirty
miles
of
the
dry
drive
behind
us
while
so
far
neither
horses
nor
cattle
had
been
put
to
any
extra
exertion
the
wagon
followed
as
usual
and
for
over
three
hours
we
held
the
trail
without
a
break
when
sighting
a
divide
in
our
front
the
foreman
went
back
and
sent
the
wagon
around
the
herd
with
instructions
to
make
the
noon
camp
well
up
on
the
divide
we
threw
the
herd
off
the
trail
within
a
mile
of
this
stopping
place
and
allowed
them
to
graze
while
two
thirds
of
the
outfit
galloped
away
to
the
wagon
we
allowed
the
cattle
to
lie
down
and
rest
to
their
complete
satisfaction
until
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
meanwhile
all
hands
with
the
exception
of
two
men
on
herd
also
lay
down
and
slept
in
the
shade
of
the
wagon
when
the
cattle
had
had
several
hours
sleep
the
want
of
water
made
them
restless
and
they
began
to
rise
and
graze
away
then
all
hands
were
aroused
and
we
threw
them
upon
the
trail
the
heat
of
the
day
was
already
over
and
until
the
twilight
of
the
evening
we
trailed
a
clip
and
again
threw
the
herd
off
to
graze
by
our
traveling
and
grazing
gaits
we
could
form
an
approximate
idea
as
to
the
distance
we
had
covered
and
the
consensus
of
opinion
of
all
was
that
we
had
already
killed
over
half
the
distance
the
herd
was
beginning
to
show
the
want
of
water
by
evening
but
amongst
our
saddle
horses
the
lack
of
water
was
more
noticeable
as
a
horse
subsisting
on
grass
alone
weakens
easily
and
riding
them
made
them
all
the
more
gaunt
when
we
caught
up
our
mounts
that
evening
we
had
used
eight
horses
to
the
man
since
we
had
left
the
south
fork
and
another
one
would
be
required
at
midnight
or
whenever
we
halted
we
made
our
drive
the
second
night
with
more
confidence
than
the
one
before
but
there
were
times
when
the
train
of
cattle
must
have
been
nearly
two
miles
in
length
yet
there
was
never
a
halt
as
long
as
the
man
with
the
lead
light
could
see
the
one
in
the
rear
we
bedded
the
herd
about
midnight
and
at
the
first
break
of
day
the
fourth
guard
with
the
foreman
joined
us
on
our
watch
and
we
started
the
cattle
again
there
was
a
light
dew
the
second
night
and
the
cattle
hungered
by
their
night
walk
went
to
grazing
at
once
on
the
damp
grass
which
would
allay
their
thirst
slightly
we
allowed
them
to
scatter
over
several
thousand
acres
for
we
were
anxious
to
graze
them
well
before
the
sun
absorbed
the
moisture
but
at
the
same
time
every
step
they
took
was
one
less
to
the
coveted
powder
river
when
we
had
grazed
the
herd
forward
several
miles
and
the
sun
was
nearly
an
hour
high
the
wagon
failed
to
come
up
which
caused
our
foreman
some
slight
uneasiness
nearly
another
hour
passed
and
still
the
wagon
did
not
come
up
nor
did
the
outfit
put
in
an
appearance
soon
afterwards
however
moss
strayhorn
overtook
us
and
reported
that
over
forty
of
our
saddle
horses
were
missing
while
the
work
mules
had
been
overtaken
nearly
five
miles
back
on
the
trail
on
account
of
my
ability
as
a
trailer
flood
at
once
dispatched
me
to
assist
honeyman
in
recovering
the
missing
horses
instructing
some
one
else
to
take
the
and
the
wagon
and
horses
to
follow
up
the
herd
by
the
time
i
arrived
most
of
the
boys
at
camp
had
secured
a
change
of
horses
and
i
caught
up
my
that
i
was
saving
for
the
last
hard
ride
for
the
horse
hunt
which
confronted
us
mccann
having
no
fire
built
gave
honeyman
and
myself
an
impromptu
breakfast
and
two
canteens
of
water
but
before
we
let
the
wagon
get
away
we
rustled
a
couple
of
cans
of
tomatoes
and
buried
them
in
a
cache
near
the
where
we
would
have
no
trouble
in
finding
them
on
our
return
as
the
wagon
pulled
out
we
mounted
our
horses
and
rode
back
down
the
trail
billy
honeyman
understood
horses
and
at
once
volunteered
the
belief
that
we
would
have
a
long
ride
overtaking
the
missing
saddle
stock
the
absent
horses
he
said
were
principally
the
ones
which
had
been
under
saddle
the
day
before
and
as
we
both
knew
a
tired
thirsty
horse
will
go
miles
for
water
he
recalled
also
that
while
we
were
asleep
at
noon
the
day
before
twenty
miles
back
on
the
trail
the
horses
had
found
quite
a
patch
of
wild
sorrel
plant
and
were
foolish
over
leaving
it
both
of
us
being
satisfied
that
this
would
hold
them
for
several
hours
at
least
we
struck
a
free
gait
for
it
after
we
passed
the
point
where
the
mules
had
been
overtaken
the
trail
of
the
horses
was
distinct
enough
for
us
to
follow
in
an
easy
canter
we
saw
frequent
signs
that
they
left
the
trail
no
doubt
to
graze
but
only
for
short
distances
when
they
would
enter
it
again
and
keep
it
for
miles
shortly
before
noon
as
we
gained
the
divide
above
our
noon
camp
of
the
day
before
there
about
two
miles
distant
we
saw
our
missing
horses
feeding
over
an
alkali
flat
on
which
grew
wild
sorrel
and
other
species
of
sour
plants
we
rounded
them
up
and
finding
none
missing
we
first
secured
a
change
of
mounts
the
only
two
horses
of
my
mount
in
this
portion
of
the
had
both
been
under
saddle
the
afternoon
and
night
before
and
were
as
gaunt
as
rails
and
honeyman
had
one
unused
horse
of
his
mount
in
the
hand
so
when
taking
down
our
ropes
we
halted
the
horses
and
began
riding
slowly
around
them
forcing
them
into
a
compact
body
i
had
my
eye
on
a
brown
horse
of
flood
that
had
not
had
a
saddle
on
in
a
week
and
told
billy
to
fasten
to
him
if
he
got
a
chance
this
was
in
violation
of
all
custom
but
if
the
foreman
kicked
i
had
a
good
excuse
to
offer
honeyman
was
and
threw
a
rope
splendidly
and
as
we
circled
around
the
horses
on
opposite
sides
on
a
signal
from
him
we
whirled
our
lariats
and
made
casts
simultaneously
the
wrangler
fastened
to
the
brown
i
wanted
and
my
loop
settled
around
the
neck
of
his
unridden
horse
as
the
band
broke
away
from
our
swinging
ropes
a
number
of
them
ran
afoul
of
my
rope
but
i
gave
the
rowel
to
my
and
we
shook
them
off
when
i
returned
to
honeyman
and
we
had
exchanged
horses
and
were
shifting
our
saddles
i
complimented
him
on
the
long
throw
he
had
made
in
catching
the
brown
and
incidentally
mentioned
that
i
had
read
of
vaqueros
in
california
who
used
a
foot
lariat
hell
said
billy
in
ridicule
of
the
idea
there
was
a
man
ever
born
who
could
throw
a
foot
rope
its
full
length
without
he
threw
it
down
a
well
the
sun
was
straight
overhead
when
we
started
back
to
overtake
the
herd
we
struck
into
a
little
better
than
a
gait
on
the
return
trip
and
about
two
sighted
a
band
of
saddle
horses
and
a
wagon
camped
perhaps
a
mile
forward
and
to
the
side
of
the
trail
on
coming
near
enough
we
saw
at
a
glance
it
was
a
cow
outfit
and
after
driving
our
loose
horses
a
good
push
beyond
their
camp
turned
and
rode
back
to
their
wagon
we
give
them
a
chance
to
ask
us
to
eat
said
billy
to
me
and
if
they
do
why
they
miss
a
hell
of
a
good
chance
to
entertain
hungry
men
but
the
foreman
with
the
stranger
wagon
proved
to
be
a
bee
county
texan
and
our
doubts
did
him
an
injustice
for
although
dinner
was
over
he
invited
us
to
dismount
and
ordered
his
cook
to
set
out
something
to
eat
they
had
met
our
wagon
and
mccann
had
insisted
on
their
taking
a
quarter
of
our
beef
so
we
fared
well
the
outfit
was
from
a
ranch
near
miles
city
montana
and
were
going
down
to
receive
a
herd
of
cattle
at
cheyenne
wyoming
the
cattle
had
been
bought
at
ogalalla
for
delivery
at
the
former
point
and
this
wagon
was
going
down
with
their
ranch
outfit
to
take
the
herd
on
its
arrival
they
had
brought
along
about
saddle
horses
from
the
ranch
though
in
buying
the
herd
they
had
taken
its
of
over
a
hundred
saddle
horses
the
foreman
informed
us
that
they
had
met
our
cattle
about
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
nearly
miles
out
from
powder
river
after
we
had
satisfied
the
inner
man
we
lost
no
time
getting
off
as
we
could
see
a
long
ride
ahead
of
us
but
we
had
occasion
as
we
rode
away
to
go
through
their
to
cut
out
a
few
of
our
horses
which
had
mixed
and
i
found
i
knew
over
a
dozen
of
their
horses
by
the
ranch
brands
while
honeyman
also
recognized
quite
a
few
though
we
felt
a
pride
in
our
mounts
we
had
to
admit
that
theirs
were
better
for
the
effect
of
climate
had
transformed
horses
that
we
had
once
ridden
on
ranches
in
southern
texas
it
does
seem
incredible
but
it
is
a
fact
nevertheless
that
a
horse
having
reached
the
years
of
maturity
in
a
southern
climate
will
grow
half
a
hand
taller
and
carry
two
hundred
pounds
more
flesh
when
he
has
undergone
the
rigors
of
several
northern
winters
we
halted
at
our
night
camp
to
change
horses
and
to
unearth
our
cached
tomatoes
and
again
set
out
by
then
it
was
so
late
in
the
day
that
the
sun
had
lost
its
force
and
on
this
last
leg
in
overtaking
the
herd
we
increased
our
gait
steadily
until
the
sun
was
scarcely
an
hour
high
and
yet
we
never
sighted
a
in
our
front
about
sundown
we
called
a
few
minutes
halt
and
after
eating
our
tomatoes
and
drinking
the
last
of
our
water
again
pushed
on
twilight
had
faded
into
dusk
before
we
reached
a
divide
which
we
had
had
in
sight
for
several
hours
and
which
we
had
hoped
to
gain
in
time
to
sight
the
timber
on
powder
river
before
dark
but
as
we
put
mile
after
mile
behind
us
that
divide
seemed
to
move
away
like
a
mirage
and
the
evening
star
had
been
shining
for
an
hour
before
we
finally
reached
it
and
sighted
instead
of
powder
timber
the
campfire
of
our
outfit
about
five
miles
ahead
we
fired
several
shots
on
seeing
the
light
in
the
hope
that
they
might
hear
us
in
camp
and
wait
otherwise
we
knew
they
would
start
the
herd
with
the
rising
of
the
moon
when
we
finally
reached
camp
about
nine
at
night
everything
was
in
readiness
to
start
the
moon
having
risen
sufficiently
our
shooting
however
had
been
heard
and
horses
for
a
change
were
tied
to
the
wagon
wheels
while
the
remainder
of
the
was
under
herd
in
charge
of
rod
wheat
the
runaways
were
thrown
into
the
horse
herd
while
we
bolted
our
suppers
meantime
mccann
informed
us
that
flood
had
ridden
that
afternoon
to
the
powder
river
in
order
to
get
the
lay
of
the
land
he
had
found
it
to
be
ten
or
twelve
miles
distant
from
the
present
camp
and
the
water
in
the
river
barely
knee
deep
to
a
saddle
horse
beyond
it
was
a
fine
valley
before
we
started
flood
rode
in
from
the
herd
and
said
to
honeyman
i
going
to
send
the
horses
and
wagon
ahead
and
you
and
mccann
want
to
camp
on
this
side
of
the
river
under
the
hill
and
just
a
few
hundred
yards
below
the
ford
throw
your
saddle
horses
across
the
river
and
build
a
fire
before
you
go
to
sleep
so
we
will
have
a
beacon
light
to
pilot
us
in
in
case
the
cattle
break
into
a
run
on
scenting
the
water
the
herd
will
get
in
a
little
after
midnight
and
after
crossing
turn
her
loose
just
for
luck
it
did
me
good
to
hear
the
foreman
say
the
herd
was
to
be
turned
loose
for
i
had
been
in
the
saddle
since
three
that
morning
had
ridden
over
eighty
miles
and
had
now
ten
more
in
sight
while
honeyman
would
complete
the
day
with
over
a
hundred
to
his
credit
we
let
the
take
the
lead
in
pulling
out
so
that
the
wagon
mules
could
be
spurred
to
their
utmost
in
keeping
up
with
the
loose
horses
once
they
were
clear
of
the
herd
we
let
the
cattle
into
the
trail
they
had
refused
to
bed
down
for
they
were
uneasy
with
thirst
but
the
cool
weather
had
saved
them
any
serious
suffering
we
all
felt
gala
as
the
herd
strung
out
on
the
trail
before
we
halted
again
there
would
be
water
for
our
dumb
brutes
and
rest
for
ourselves
there
was
lots
of
singing
that
night
there
one
more
river
to
cross
and
roll
powder
roll
were
wafted
out
on
the
night
air
to
the
coyotes
that
howled
on
our
flanks
or
to
the
prairie
dogs
as
they
peeped
from
their
burrows
at
this
weird
caravan
of
the
night
and
the
lights
which
flickered
in
our
front
and
rear
must
have
been
real
or
to
these
occupants
of
the
plain
before
we
had
covered
half
the
distance
the
herd
was
over
two
miles
and
as
flood
rode
back
to
the
rear
every
half
hour
or
so
he
showed
no
inclination
to
check
the
lead
and
give
the
rear
guard
a
chance
to
close
up
the
column
but
about
an
hour
before
midnight
we
saw
a
light
low
down
in
our
front
which
gradually
increased
until
the
treetops
were
distinctly
visible
and
we
knew
that
our
wagon
had
reached
the
river
on
sighting
this
beacon
the
long
yell
went
up
and
down
the
column
and
the
herd
walked
as
only
thirsty
texas
cattle
can
walk
when
they
scent
water
flood
called
all
the
swing
men
to
the
rear
and
we
threw
out
a
skirmish
line
covering
a
mile
in
width
so
far
back
that
only
an
occasional
glimmer
of
the
lead
light
could
be
seen
the
trail
struck
the
powder
on
an
angle
and
when
within
a
mile
of
the
river
the
swing
cattle
left
the
paths
and
started
for
the
nearest
water
the
left
flank
of
our
skirmish
line
encountered
the
cattle
as
they
reached
the
river
and
prevented
them
from
drifting
up
the
stream
the
point
men
abandoned
the
leaders
when
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
the
river
then
the
rear
guard
of
cripples
and
cattle
came
up
and
the
two
flanks
of
horsemen
pushed
them
all
across
the
river
until
they
met
when
we
turned
and
galloped
into
camp
making
the
night
hideous
with
our
yelling
the
longest
dry
drive
of
the
trip
had
been
successfully
made
and
we
all
felt
jubilant
we
stripped
bridles
and
saddles
from
our
tired
horses
and
unrolling
our
beds
were
soon
lost
in
sleep
the
stars
may
have
twinkled
overhead
and
sundry
voices
of
the
night
may
have
whispered
to
us
as
we
lay
down
to
sleep
but
we
were
too
tired
for
poetry
or
sentiment
that
night
chapter
xxi
the
yellowstone
the
tramping
of
our
as
they
came
trotting
up
to
the
wagon
the
next
morning
and
honeyman
calling
horses
horses
brought
us
to
the
realization
that
another
day
had
dawned
with
its
duty
mccann
had
stretched
the
ropes
of
our
corral
for
flood
was
as
dead
to
the
world
as
any
of
us
were
but
the
tramping
of
over
a
hundred
and
forty
horses
and
mules
as
they
crowded
inside
the
ropes
brought
him
into
action
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
we
had
had
a
good
five
hours
sleep
while
our
mounts
had
been
transformed
from
gaunt
animals
to
saddle
horses
that
fought
and
struggled
amongst
themselves
or
artfully
dodged
the
lariat
loops
which
were
being
cast
after
them
honeyman
reported
the
herd
quietly
grazing
across
the
river
and
after
securing
our
mounts
for
the
morning
we
breakfasted
before
looking
after
the
cattle
it
took
us
less
than
an
hour
to
round
up
and
count
the
cattle
and
turn
them
loose
again
under
herd
to
graze
those
of
us
not
on
herd
returned
to
the
wagon
and
our
foreman
instructed
mccann
to
make
a
two
hours
drive
down
the
river
and
camp
for
noon
as
he
proposed
only
to
graze
the
herd
that
morning
after
seeing
the
wagon
safely
beyond
the
rocky
crossing
we
hunted
up
a
good
bathing
pool
and
disported
ourselves
for
half
an
hour
taking
a
much
needed
bath
there
were
trails
on
either
side
of
the
powder
and
as
our
course
was
henceforth
to
the
northwest
we
remained
on
the
west
side
and
grazed
or
trailed
down
it
it
was
a
beautiful
stream
of
water
having
its
source
in
the
big
horn
mountains
frequently
visible
on
our
left
for
the
next
four
or
five
days
we
had
easy
work
there
were
range
cattle
through
that
section
but
fearful
of
texas
fever
their
owners
gave
the
powder
river
a
wide
berth
with
the
exception
of
holding
the
herd
at
night
our
duties
were
light
we
caught
fish
and
killed
grouse
and
the
respite
seemed
like
a
holiday
after
our
experience
of
the
past
few
days
during
the
evening
of
the
second
day
after
reaching
the
powder
we
crossed
the
crazy
woman
a
clear
mountainous
fork
of
the
former
river
and
nearly
as
large
as
the
parent
stream
once
or
twice
we
encountered
range
riders
and
learned
that
the
crazy
woman
was
a
stock
country
a
number
of
beef
ranches
being
located
on
it
stocked
with
texas
cattle
somewhere
near
or
about
the
montana
line
we
took
a
trail
flood
had
ridden
it
out
until
he
had
satisfied
himself
that
it
led
over
to
the
tongue
river
and
the
country
beyond
while
large
trails
followed
on
down
the
powder
their
direction
was
wrong
for
us
as
they
led
towards
the
bad
lands
and
the
lower
yellowstone
country
on
the
second
day
out
after
taking
the
trail
we
encountered
some
rough
country
in
passing
across
a
saddle
in
a
range
of
hills
forming
the
divide
between
the
powder
and
tongue
rivers
we
were
nearly
a
whole
day
crossing
it
but
had
a
trail
to
follow
and
down
in
the
foothills
made
camp
that
night
on
a
creek
which
emptied
into
the
tongue
the
roughness
of
the
trail
was
well
compensated
for
however
as
it
was
a
paradise
of
grass
and
water
we
reached
the
tongue
river
the
next
afternoon
and
found
it
a
similar
stream
to
the
powder
clear
as
crystal
swift
and
with
a
rocky
bottom
as
these
were
but
minor
rivers
we
encountered
no
trouble
in
crossing
them
the
greatest
danger
being
to
our
wagon
on
the
tongue
we
met
range
riders
again
and
from
them
we
learned
that
this
trail
which
crossed
the
yellowstone
at
frenchman
ford
was
the
one
in
use
by
herds
bound
for
the
musselshell
and
remoter
points
on
the
upper
missouri
from
one
rider
we
learned
that
the
first
herd
of
the
present
season
which
went
through
on
this
route
were
cattle
wintered
on
the
niobrara
in
western
nebraska
whose
destination
was
alberta
in
the
british
possessions
this
herd
outclassed
us
in
penetrating
northward
though
in
distance
they
had
not
traveled
half
as
far
as
our
circle
dots
after
following
the
tongue
river
several
days
and
coming
out
on
that
immense
plain
tributary
to
the
yellowstone
the
trail
turned
to
the
northwest
gave
us
a
short
day
drive
to
the
rosebud
river
and
after
following
it
a
few
miles
bore
off
again
on
the
same
quarter
in
our
rear
hung
the
mountains
with
their
sentinel
peaks
while
in
our
front
stretched
the
valley
tributary
to
the
yellowstone
in
extent
itself
an
inland
empire
the
month
was
august
and
with
the
exception
of
cool
nights
no
complaint
could
be
made
for
that
rarefied
atmosphere
was
a
tonic
to
man
and
beast
and
there
was
pleasure
in
the
primitive
freshness
of
the
country
which
rolled
away
on
every
hand
on
leaving
the
rosebud
two
days
travel
brought
us
to
the
east
fork
of
sweet
grass
an
insignificant
stream
with
a
swift
current
and
rocky
crossings
in
the
first
two
hours
after
reaching
it
we
must
have
crossed
it
half
a
dozen
times
following
the
grassy
bottoms
which
shifted
from
one
bank
to
the
other
when
we
were
full
forty
miles
distant
from
frenchman
ford
on
the
yellowstone
the
wagon
in
crossing
sweet
grass
went
down
a
sidling
bank
into
the
bottom
of
the
creek
the
left
hind
wheel
collided
with
a
boulder
in
the
water
dishing
it
and
every
spoke
in
the
wheel
snapped
off
at
the
shoulder
in
the
felloe
mccann
never
noticed
it
but
poured
the
whip
into
the
mules
and
when
he
pulled
out
on
the
opposite
bank
left
the
felloe
of
his
wheel
in
the
creek
behind
the
herd
was
in
the
lead
at
the
time
and
when
honeyman
overtook
us
and
reported
the
accident
we
threw
the
herd
off
to
graze
and
over
half
the
outfit
returned
to
the
wagon
when
we
reached
the
scene
mccann
had
recovered
the
felloe
but
every
spoke
in
the
hub
was
hopelessly
ruined
flood
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
he
ordered
the
wagon
unloaded
and
the
reach
lengthened
took
the
axe
and
with
the
rebel
went
back
about
a
mile
to
a
thicket
of
lodge
poles
which
we
had
passed
higher
up
the
creek
while
the
rest
of
us
unloaded
the
wagon
mccann
who
was
swearing
by
both
note
and
rhyme
unearthed
his
saddle
from
amongst
the
other
plunder
and
cinched
it
on
his
nigh
wheeler
we
had
the
wagon
unloaded
and
had
reloaded
some
of
the
heaviest
of
the
plunder
in
the
front
end
of
the
wagon
box
by
the
time
our
foreman
and
priest
returned
dragging
from
their
pommels
a
pole
as
perfect
as
the
mast
of
a
yacht
we
knocked
off
all
the
spokes
not
already
broken
at
the
hub
of
the
ruined
wheel
and
after
jacking
up
the
hind
axle
attached
the
crutch
by
cutting
a
half
notch
in
the
larger
end
of
the
pole
so
that
it
fitted
over
the
front
axle
lashing
it
there
securely
and
allowing
the
other
end
to
trail
behind
on
the
ground
we
devised
a
support
on
which
the
hub
of
the
broken
wheel
rested
almost
at
its
normal
height
there
was
sufficient
spring
to
the
pole
to
obviate
any
jolt
or
jar
while
the
rearrangement
we
had
effected
in
distributing
the
load
would
relieve
it
of
any
serious
burden
we
took
a
rope
from
the
coupling
pole
of
the
wagon
and
loosely
noosed
it
over
the
crutch
which
allowed
leeway
in
turning
but
prevented
the
hub
from
slipping
off
the
support
on
a
short
turn
to
the
left
then
we
lashed
the
tire
and
felloe
to
the
front
end
of
the
wagon
and
with
the
loss
of
but
a
couple
of
hours
our
commissary
was
again
on
the
move
the
trail
followed
the
sweet
grass
down
to
the
yellowstone
and
until
we
reached
it
whenever
there
were
creeks
to
ford
or
extra
pulls
on
hills
half
a
dozen
of
us
would
drop
back
and
lend
a
hand
from
our
saddle
pommels
the
gradual
decline
of
the
country
to
the
river
was
in
our
favor
at
present
and
we
should
reach
the
ford
in
two
days
at
the
farthest
where
we
hoped
to
find
a
wheelwright
in
case
we
did
not
our
foreman
thought
he
could
effect
a
trade
for
a
serviceable
wagon
as
ours
was
a
new
one
and
the
best
make
in
the
market
the
next
day
flood
rode
on
ahead
to
frenchman
ford
and
late
in
the
day
returned
with
the
information
that
the
ford
was
quite
a
pretentious
frontier
village
of
the
squatter
type
there
was
a
blacksmith
and
a
wheelwright
shop
in
the
town
but
the
prospect
of
an
exchange
was
discouraging
as
the
wagons
there
were
of
the
heavy
freighting
type
while
ours
was
a
wide
tread
a
serious
objection
as
wagons
manufactured
for
southern
trade
were
eight
inches
wider
than
those
in
use
in
the
north
and
therefore
would
not
track
on
the
same
road
the
wheelwright
had
assured
flood
that
the
wheel
could
be
filled
in
a
day
with
the
exception
of
painting
and
as
paint
was
not
important
he
had
decided
to
move
up
within
three
or
four
miles
of
the
ford
and
lie
over
a
day
for
repairing
the
wagon
and
at
the
same
time
have
our
mules
reshod
accordingly
we
moved
up
the
next
morning
and
after
unloading
the
wagon
both
box
and
contents
over
half
the
outfit
the
first
and
second
guards
accompanied
the
wagon
into
the
ford
they
were
to
return
by
noon
when
the
remainder
of
us
were
to
have
our
turn
in
seeing
the
sights
of
frenchman
ford
the
horse
wrangler
remained
behind
with
us
to
accompany
the
other
half
of
the
outfit
in
the
afternoon
the
herd
was
no
trouble
to
hold
and
after
watering
about
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
three
of
us
went
into
camp
and
got
dinner
as
this
was
the
first
time
since
starting
that
our
cook
was
absent
we
rather
enjoyed
the
opportunity
to
practice
our
culinary
skill
pride
in
our
ability
to
cook
was
a
weakness
in
our
craft
the
work
was
divided
up
between
joe
stallings
john
officer
and
myself
honeyman
being
excused
on
agreeing
to
rustle
the
wood
and
water
stallings
prided
himself
on
being
an
artist
in
making
coffee
and
while
hunting
for
the
coffee
mill
found
a
bag
of
dried
peaches
say
fellows
said
joe
i
bet
mccann
has
hauled
this
fruit
a
thousand
miles
and
never
knew
he
had
it
amongst
all
this
plunder
going
to
stew
a
saucepan
full
of
it
just
to
show
his
royal
nibs
that
he
been
thoughtless
of
his
boarders
officer
volunteered
to
cut
and
fry
the
meat
for
we
were
eating
stray
beef
now
with
great
regularity
and
the
making
of
the
biscuits
fell
to
me
honeyman
soon
had
a
fire
so
big
that
you
could
not
have
got
near
it
without
a
wet
blanket
on
and
when
my
biscuits
were
ready
for
the
dutch
oven
officer
threw
a
bucket
of
water
on
the
fire
remarking
honeyman
if
you
was
under
me
and
built
up
such
a
big
fire
for
the
chef
there
would
be
trouble
in
camp
you
may
be
a
good
enough
horse
wrangler
for
a
through
texas
outfit
but
when
it
comes
to
playing
second
fiddle
to
a
cook
of
my
accomplishments
well
you
simply
do
know
salt
from
wild
honey
a
man
might
as
well
try
to
cook
on
a
burning
haystack
as
on
a
fire
of
your
building
when
the
fire
had
burned
down
sufficiently
the
cooks
got
their
respective
utensils
upon
the
fire
i
had
an
ample
supply
of
live
coals
for
the
dutch
oven
and
dinner
was
shortly
afterwards
announced
as
ready
after
dinner
officer
and
i
relieved
the
men
on
herd
but
over
an
hour
passed
before
we
caught
sight
of
the
first
and
second
guards
returning
from
the
ford
they
were
men
who
could
stay
in
town
all
day
and
enjoy
themselves
but
as
flood
had
reminded
them
there
were
others
who
were
entitled
to
a
holiday
when
bob
blades
and
fox
quarternight
came
to
our
relief
on
herd
they
attempted
to
detain
us
with
a
description
of
frenchman
ford
but
we
cut
all
conversation
short
by
riding
away
to
camp
we
just
save
them
the
trouble
and
go
in
and
see
it
for
ourselves
said
officer
to
me
as
we
galloped
along
we
had
left
word
with
honeyman
what
horses
we
wanted
to
ride
that
afternoon
and
lost
little
time
in
changing
mounts
then
we
all
set
out
to
pay
our
respects
to
the
mushroom
village
on
the
yellowstone
most
of
us
had
money
and
those
of
the
outfit
who
had
returned
were
clean
shaven
and
brought
the
report
that
a
shave
was
and
a
drink
the
same
price
the
town
struck
me
as
something
new
and
novel
two
thirds
of
the
habitations
being
of
canvas
immense
quantities
of
buffalo
hides
were
drying
or
already
baled
and
waiting
transportation
as
we
afterward
learned
to
navigable
points
on
the
missouri
large
bull
trains
were
encamped
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
while
many
such
outfits
were
in
town
receiving
cargoes
or
discharging
freight
the
drivers
of
these
ox
trains
lounged
in
the
streets
and
thronged
the
saloons
and
gambling
resorts
the
population
was
extremely
mixed
and
almost
every
language
could
be
heard
spoken
on
the
streets
the
men
were
fine
types
of
the
pioneer
buffalo
hunters
freighters
and
other
plainsmen
though
hardly
as
picturesque
in
figure
and
costume
as
a
modern
artist
would
paint
them
for
native
coloring
there
were
typical
specimens
of
northern
indians
grunting
their
jargon
amid
the
babel
of
other
tongues
and
groups
of
squaws
wandered
through
the
irregular
streets
in
gaudy
blankets
and
red
calico
the
only
civilizing
element
to
be
seen
was
the
camp
of
engineers
running
the
survey
of
the
northern
pacific
railroad
tying
our
horses
in
a
group
to
a
in
the
rear
of
a
saloon
called
the
buffalo
bull
we
entered
by
a
rear
door
and
lined
up
at
the
bar
for
our
first
drink
since
leaving
ogalalla
games
of
chance
were
running
in
the
rear
for
those
who
felt
inclined
to
try
their
luck
while
in
front
of
the
bar
against
the
farther
wall
were
a
number
of
small
tables
around
which
were
seated
the
patrons
of
the
place
playing
for
the
drinks
one
could
help
being
impressed
with
the
unrestrained
freedom
of
the
village
whose
sole
product
seemed
to
be
buffalo
hides
every
man
in
the
place
wore
the
regulation
in
his
belt
and
quite
a
number
wore
two
the
primitive
law
of
nature
known
as
was
very
evident
in
august
of
at
frenchman
ford
it
reminded
me
of
the
early
days
at
home
in
texas
where
on
arising
in
the
morning
one
buckled
on
his
as
though
it
were
part
of
his
dress
after
a
second
round
of
drinks
we
strolled
out
into
the
front
street
to
look
up
flood
and
mccann
and
incidentally
get
a
shave
we
soon
located
mccann
who
had
a
hunk
of
dried
buffalo
meat
and
was
chipping
it
off
and
feeding
it
to
some
indian
children
whose
acquaintance
he
seemed
to
be
cultivating
on
sighting
us
he
gave
the
children
the
remainder
of
the
jerked
buffalo
and
at
once
placed
himself
at
our
disposal
as
guide
to
ford
he
had
been
all
over
the
town
that
morning
knew
the
name
of
every
saloon
and
those
of
several
barkeepers
as
well
pointed
out
the
bullet
holes
in
a
log
building
where
the
last
shooting
scrape
occurred
and
otherwise
showed
us
the
sights
in
the
village
which
we
might
have
overlooked
a
barber
shop
why
certainly
and
he
led
the
way
informing
us
that
the
wagon
wheel
would
be
filled
by
evening
that
the
mules
were
already
shod
and
that
flood
had
ridden
down
to
the
crossing
to
look
at
the
ford
two
barbers
turned
us
out
rapidly
and
as
we
left
we
continued
to
take
in
the
town
strolling
by
pairs
and
drinking
moderately
as
we
went
flood
had
returned
in
the
mean
time
and
seemed
rather
convivial
and
quite
willing
to
enjoy
the
enforced
with
us
while
taking
a
drink
in
yellowstone
bob
place
the
foreman
took
occasion
to
call
the
attention
of
the
rebel
to
a
cheap
lithograph
of
general
grant
which
hung
behind
the
bar
the
two
discussed
the
merits
of
the
picture
and
priest
who
was
an
admirer
of
the
magnanimity
as
well
as
the
military
genius
of
grant
spoke
in
reserved
yet
favorable
terms
of
the
general
when
flood
flippantly
chided
him
on
his
eulogistic
remarks
over
an
officer
to
whom
he
had
once
been
surrendered
the
rebel
took
the
chaffing
in
all
good
humor
and
when
our
glasses
were
filled
flood
suggested
to
priest
that
since
he
was
such
an
admirer
of
grant
possibly
he
wished
to
propose
a
toast
to
the
general
health
you
young
jim
said
the
rebel
and
if
you
gone
through
what
i
have
your
views
of
things
might
be
different
my
admiration
for
the
generals
on
our
side
survived
wounds
prisons
and
changes
of
fortune
but
time
has
tempered
my
views
on
some
things
and
now
i
do
enthuse
over
generals
when
the
men
of
the
ranks
who
made
them
famous
are
forgotten
through
the
fortunes
of
war
i
saluted
grant
when
we
were
surrendered
but
i
would
propose
a
toast
or
take
off
my
hat
now
to
any
man
that
lives
during
the
comments
of
the
rebel
a
stranger
who
evidently
overheard
them
rose
from
one
of
the
tables
in
the
place
and
sauntered
over
to
the
end
of
the
bar
an
attentive
listener
to
the
succeeding
conversation
he
was
a
younger
man
than
priest
with
a
head
of
heavy
black
hair
reaching
his
shoulders
while
his
dress
was
largely
of
buckskin
profusely
ornamented
with
beadwork
and
fringes
he
was
armed
as
was
every
one
else
and
from
his
languid
demeanor
as
well
as
from
his
smart
appearance
one
would
classify
him
at
a
passing
glance
as
a
frontier
gambler
as
we
turned
away
from
the
bar
to
an
unoccupied
table
priest
waited
for
his
change
when
the
stranger
accosted
him
with
an
inquiry
as
to
where
he
was
from
in
the
conversation
that
ensued
the
stranger
who
had
noticed
the
manner
in
which
the
rebel
had
taken
the
chiding
of
our
foreman
pretending
to
take
him
to
task
for
some
of
his
remarks
but
in
this
he
made
a
mistake
what
his
friends
might
safely
say
to
priest
would
be
treated
as
an
insult
from
a
stranger
seeing
that
he
would
not
stand
his
chiding
the
other
attempted
to
mollify
him
by
proposing
they
have
a
drink
together
and
part
friendly
to
which
the
rebel
assented
i
was
pleased
with
the
favorable
turn
of
affairs
for
my
bunkie
had
used
some
rather
severe
language
in
resenting
the
remarks
of
the
stranger
which
now
had
the
promise
of
being
dropped
amicably
i
knew
the
temper
of
priest
and
so
did
flood
and
honeyman
and
we
were
all
anxious
to
get
him
away
from
the
stranger
so
i
asked
our
foreman
as
soon
as
they
had
drunk
together
to
go
over
and
tell
priest
we
were
waiting
for
him
to
make
up
a
game
of
cards
the
two
were
standing
at
the
bar
in
a
most
friendly
attitude
but
as
they
raised
their
glasses
to
drink
the
stranger
holding
his
at
arm
length
said
here
a
toast
for
you
to
general
grant
the
ablest
but
the
toast
was
never
finished
for
priest
dashed
the
contents
of
his
glass
in
the
stranger
face
and
calmly
replacing
the
glass
on
the
bar
backed
across
the
room
towards
us
when
a
sudden
movement
on
the
part
of
the
stranger
caused
him
to
halt
but
it
seemed
the
picturesque
gentleman
beside
the
bar
was
only
searching
his
pockets
for
a
handkerchief
do
get
your
hand
on
that
gun
you
wear
said
the
rebel
whose
blood
was
up
unless
you
intend
to
use
it
but
you
ca
shoot
a
minute
too
quick
to
suit
me
what
do
you
wear
a
gun
for
anyhow
see
how
straight
you
can
shoot
as
the
stranger
made
no
reply
priest
continued
the
next
time
you
have
anything
to
rub
in
pick
your
man
better
the
man
who
insults
me
get
all
that
due
him
for
his
trouble
still
eliciting
no
response
the
rebel
taunted
him
further
saying
go
on
and
finish
your
toast
you
patriotic
beauty
i
give
you
another
jeff
davis
and
the
southern
confederacy
we
all
rose
from
the
table
and
flood
going
over
to
priest
said
come
along
paul
we
do
want
to
have
any
trouble
here
let
go
across
the
street
and
have
a
game
of
california
jack
but
the
rebel
stood
like
a
chiseled
statue
ignoring
the
friendly
counsel
of
our
foreman
while
the
stranger
after
wiping
the
liquor
from
his
face
and
person
walked
across
the
room
and
seated
himself
at
the
table
from
which
he
had
risen
a
stillness
as
of
death
pervaded
the
room
which
was
only
broken
by
our
foreman
repeating
his
request
to
priest
to
come
away
but
the
latter
replied
no
when
i
leave
this
place
it
will
not
be
done
in
fear
of
any
one
when
any
man
goes
out
of
his
way
to
insult
me
he
must
take
the
consequences
and
he
can
always
find
me
if
he
wants
satisfaction
we
take
another
drink
before
we
go
everybody
in
the
house
come
up
and
take
a
drink
with
paul
priest
the
inmates
of
the
place
to
the
number
of
possibly
twenty
who
had
been
witness
to
what
had
occurred
accepted
the
invitation
quitting
their
games
and
gathering
around
the
bar
priest
took
a
position
at
the
end
of
the
bar
where
he
could
notice
any
movement
on
the
part
of
his
adversary
as
well
as
the
faces
of
his
guests
and
smiling
on
them
said
in
true
hospitality
what
will
you
have
gentlemen
there
was
a
forced
effort
on
the
part
of
the
drinkers
to
appear
indifferent
to
the
situation
but
with
the
stranger
sitting
sullenly
in
their
rear
and
an
man
standing
at
the
farther
end
of
the
line
hungering
for
an
opportunity
to
settle
differences
with
their
indifference
was
an
empty
mockery
some
of
the
players
returned
to
their
games
while
others
sauntered
into
the
street
yet
priest
showed
no
disposition
to
go
after
a
while
the
stranger
walked
over
to
the
bar
and
called
for
a
glass
of
whiskey
the
rebel
stood
at
the
end
of
the
bar
calmly
rolling
a
cigarette
and
as
the
stranger
seemed
not
to
notice
him
priest
attracted
his
attention
and
said
i
just
passing
through
here
and
shall
only
be
in
town
this
afternoon
so
if
there
anything
between
us
that
demands
settlement
do
hesitate
to
ask
for
it
the
stranger
drained
his
glass
at
a
single
gulp
and
with
admirable
composure
replied
if
there
anything
between
us
we
settle
it
in
due
time
and
as
men
usually
settle
such
differences
in
this
country
i
have
a
friend
or
two
in
town
and
as
soon
as
i
see
them
you
will
receive
notice
or
you
may
consider
the
matter
dropped
that
all
i
care
to
say
at
present
he
walked
away
to
the
rear
of
the
room
priest
joined
us
and
we
strolled
out
of
the
place
in
the
street
a
grizzled
man
who
had
drunk
with
him
inside
approached
my
bunkie
and
said
you
want
to
watch
that
fellow
he
claims
to
be
from
the
gallatin
country
but
he
is
for
i
live
there
there
a
pal
with
him
and
they
got
some
good
horses
but
i
know
every
brand
on
the
headwaters
of
the
missouri
and
their
horses
were
never
bred
on
any
of
its
three
forks
do
give
him
any
the
best
of
you
keep
an
eye
on
him
comrade
after
this
warning
the
old
man
turned
into
the
first
open
door
and
we
crossed
over
to
the
wheelwright
shop
and
as
the
wheel
would
not
be
finished
for
several
hours
yet
we
continued
our
survey
of
the
town
and
our
next
landing
was
at
the
buffalo
bull
on
entering
we
found
four
of
our
men
in
a
game
of
cards
at
the
very
first
table
while
officer
was
reported
as
being
in
the
gambling
room
in
the
rear
the
only
vacant
table
in
the
was
the
last
one
in
the
far
corner
and
calling
for
a
deck
of
cards
we
occupied
it
i
sat
with
my
back
to
the
log
wall
of
the
low
room
while
on
my
left
and
fronting
the
door
priest
took
a
seat
with
flood
for
his
pardner
while
honeyman
fell
to
me
after
playing
a
few
hands
flood
suggested
that
billy
go
forward
and
exchange
seats
with
some
of
our
outfit
so
as
to
be
near
the
door
where
he
could
see
any
one
that
entered
while
from
his
position
the
rear
door
would
be
similarly
guarded
under
this
change
rod
wheat
came
back
to
our
table
and
took
honeyman
place
we
had
been
playing
along
for
an
hour
with
people
passing
in
and
out
of
the
gambling
room
and
expected
shortly
to
start
for
camp
when
priest
adversary
came
in
at
the
front
door
and
walking
through
the
room
passed
into
the
gambling
department
john
officer
after
winning
a
few
dollars
in
the
card
room
was
standing
alongside
watching
our
game
and
as
the
stranger
passed
by
priest
gave
him
the
wink
on
which
officer
followed
the
stranger
and
a
companion
who
was
with
him
into
the
rear
room
we
had
played
only
a
few
hands
when
the
man
came
back
to
the
bar
took
a
drink
and
walked
over
to
watch
a
game
of
cards
at
the
second
table
from
the
front
door
officer
came
back
shortly
afterward
and
whispered
to
us
that
there
were
four
of
them
to
look
out
for
as
he
had
seen
them
conferring
together
priest
seemed
the
least
concerned
of
any
of
us
but
i
noticed
he
eased
the
holster
on
his
belt
forward
where
it
would
be
ready
to
his
hand
we
had
called
for
a
round
of
drinks
officer
taking
one
with
us
when
two
men
came
out
of
the
gambling
hell
and
halting
at
the
bar
pretended
to
divide
some
money
which
they
wished
to
have
it
appear
they
had
won
in
the
card
room
their
conversation
was
loud
and
intended
to
attract
attention
but
officer
gave
us
the
wink
and
their
ruse
was
perfectly
understood
after
taking
a
drink
and
attracting
as
much
attention
as
possible
over
the
division
of
the
money
they
separated
but
remained
in
the
room
i
was
dealing
the
cards
a
few
minutes
later
when
the
man
emerged
from
the
gambling
hell
and
imitating
the
maudlin
sauntered
up
to
the
bar
and
asked
for
a
drink
after
being
served
he
walked
about
halfway
to
the
door
then
whirling
suddenly
stepped
to
the
end
of
the
bar
placed
his
hands
upon
it
sprang
up
and
stood
upright
on
it
he
whipped
out
two
let
loose
a
yell
which
caused
a
commotion
throughout
the
room
and
walked
very
deliberately
the
length
of
the
counter
his
attention
centred
upon
the
occupants
of
our
table
not
attracting
the
notice
he
expected
in
our
quarter
he
turned
and
slowly
repaced
the
bar
hurling
anathemas
on
texas
and
texans
in
general
i
saw
the
rebel
eyes
steeled
to
intensity
meet
flood
across
the
table
and
in
that
glance
of
our
foreman
he
evidently
read
approval
for
he
rose
rigidly
with
the
stealth
of
a
tiger
and
for
the
first
time
that
day
his
hand
went
to
the
handle
of
his
one
of
the
two
pretended
winners
at
cards
saw
the
movement
in
our
quarter
and
sang
out
as
a
warning
cuidado
mucho
the
man
on
the
bar
whirled
on
the
word
of
warning
and
blazed
away
with
his
two
guns
into
our
corner
i
had
risen
at
the
word
and
was
pinned
against
the
wall
where
on
the
first
fire
a
rain
of
dirt
fell
from
the
chinking
in
the
wall
over
my
head
as
soon
as
the
others
sprang
away
from
the
table
i
kicked
it
over
in
clearing
myself
and
came
to
my
feet
just
as
the
rebel
fired
his
second
shot
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
his
adversary
reel
backwards
firing
his
guns
into
the
ceiling
as
he
went
and
in
falling
crash
heavily
into
the
glassware
on
the
back
bar
the
smoke
which
filled
the
room
left
nothing
visible
for
a
few
moments
meantime
priest
satisfied
that
his
aim
had
gone
true
turned
passed
through
the
rear
room
gained
his
horse
and
was
galloping
away
to
the
herd
before
any
semblance
of
order
was
restored
as
the
smoke
cleared
away
and
we
passed
forward
through
the
room
john
officer
had
one
of
the
three
pardners
standing
with
his
hands
to
the
wall
while
his
lay
on
the
floor
under
officer
foot
he
had
made
but
one
shot
into
our
corner
when
the
muzzle
of
a
gun
was
pushed
against
his
ear
with
an
imperative
order
to
drop
his
arms
which
he
had
promptly
done
the
two
others
who
had
been
under
the
surveillance
of
our
men
at
the
forward
table
never
made
a
move
or
offered
to
bring
a
gun
into
action
and
after
the
killing
of
their
picturesque
pardner
passed
together
out
of
the
house
there
had
been
five
or
six
shots
fired
into
our
corner
but
the
first
double
shot
fired
when
three
of
us
were
still
sitting
went
too
high
for
effect
while
the
remainder
were
scattering
though
rod
wheat
got
a
bullet
through
his
coat
close
enough
to
burn
the
skin
on
his
shoulder
the
dead
man
was
laid
out
on
the
floor
of
the
saloon
and
through
curiosity
for
it
could
hardly
have
been
much
of
a
novelty
to
the
inhabitants
of
frenchman
ford
hundreds
came
to
gaze
on
the
corpse
and
examine
the
wounds
one
above
the
other
through
his
vitals
either
of
which
would
have
been
fatal
officer
prisoner
admitted
that
the
dead
man
was
his
pardner
and
offered
to
remove
the
corpse
if
released
on
turning
his
over
to
the
proprietor
of
the
place
he
was
given
his
freedom
to
depart
and
look
up
his
friends
as
it
was
after
sundown
and
our
wheel
was
refilled
and
ready
we
set
out
for
camp
where
we
found
that
priest
had
taken
a
fresh
horse
and
started
back
over
the
trail
no
one
felt
any
uneasiness
over
his
absence
for
he
had
demonstrated
his
ability
to
protect
himself
and
truth
compels
me
to
say
that
the
outfit
to
a
man
was
proud
of
him
honeyman
was
substituted
on
our
guard
in
the
rebel
place
sleeping
with
me
that
night
and
after
we
were
in
bed
billy
said
in
his
enthusiasm
if
that
horse
thief
had
not
relied
on
pot
shooting
and
had
been
modest
and
only
used
one
gun
he
might
have
hurt
some
of
you
fellows
but
when
i
saw
old
paul
raising
his
gun
to
a
level
as
he
shot
i
knew
he
was
cool
and
steady
and
i
rather
died
right
there
than
see
him
fail
to
get
his
man
chapter
xxii
our
last
by
early
dawn
the
next
morning
we
were
astir
at
our
last
camp
on
sweet
grass
and
before
the
horses
were
brought
in
we
had
put
on
the
wagon
box
and
reloaded
our
effects
the
rainy
season
having
ended
in
the
mountain
regions
the
stage
of
water
in
the
yellowstone
would
present
no
difficulties
in
fording
and
our
foreman
was
anxious
to
make
a
long
drive
that
day
so
as
to
make
up
for
our
enforced
we
had
breakfasted
by
the
time
the
horses
were
corralled
and
when
we
overtook
the
grazing
herd
the
cattle
were
within
a
mile
of
the
river
flood
had
looked
over
the
ford
the
day
before
and
took
one
point
of
the
herd
as
we
went
down
into
the
crossing
the
water
was
quite
chilly
to
the
cattle
though
the
horses
in
the
lead
paid
little
attention
to
it
the
water
in
no
place
being
over
three
feet
deep
a
number
of
spectators
had
come
up
from
frenchman
to
watch
the
herd
ford
the
crossing
being
about
half
a
mile
above
the
village
no
one
made
any
inquiry
for
priest
though
ample
opportunity
was
given
them
to
see
that
the
man
was
missing
after
the
herd
had
crossed
a
number
of
us
lent
a
rope
in
assisting
the
wagon
over
and
when
we
reached
the
farther
bank
we
waved
our
hats
to
the
group
on
the
south
side
in
farewell
to
them
and
to
frenchman
ford
the
trail
on
leaving
the
river
led
up
many
berries
one
of
the
tributaries
of
the
yellowstone
putting
in
from
the
north
side
and
we
paralleled
it
mile
after
mile
it
was
with
difficulty
that
riders
could
be
kept
on
the
right
hand
side
of
the
herd
for
along
it
grew
endless
quantities
of
a
species
of
upland
huckleberry
and
breaking
off
branches
we
feasted
as
we
rode
along
the
grade
up
this
creek
was
quite
pronounced
for
before
night
the
channel
of
the
creek
had
narrowed
to
several
yards
in
width
on
the
second
day
out
the
wild
fruit
disappeared
early
in
the
morning
and
after
a
continued
gradual
climb
we
made
camp
that
night
on
the
summit
of
the
divide
within
plain
sight
of
the
musselshell
river
from
this
divide
there
was
a
splendid
view
of
the
surrounding
country
as
far
as
eye
could
see
to
our
right
as
we
neared
the
summit
we
could
see
in
that
rarefied
atmosphere
the
buttes
like
sentinels
on
duty
as
they
dotted
the
immense
tableland
between
the
yellowstone
and
the
mother
missouri
while
on
our
left
lay
a
thousand
hills
untenanted
save
by
the
deer
elk
and
a
remnant
of
buffalo
another
half
day
drive
brought
us
to
the
shoals
on
the
musselshell
about
twelve
miles
above
the
entrance
of
flatwillow
creek
it
was
one
of
the
easiest
crossings
we
had
encountered
in
many
a
day
considering
the
size
of
the
river
and
the
flow
of
water
long
before
the
advent
of
the
white
man
these
shoals
had
been
in
use
for
generations
by
the
immense
herds
of
buffalo
and
elk
migrating
back
and
forth
between
their
summer
ranges
and
winter
pasturage
as
the
converging
game
trails
on
either
side
indicated
it
was
also
an
old
indian
ford
after
crossing
and
resuming
our
afternoon
drive
the
cattle
trail
ran
within
a
mile
of
the
river
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
herd
of
northern
wintered
cattle
and
possibly
others
which
had
passed
along
a
month
or
more
in
advance
of
us
it
would
have
been
hard
to
determine
which
were
cattle
and
which
were
game
trails
the
country
being
literally
cut
up
with
these
pathways
when
within
a
few
miles
of
the
flatwillow
the
trail
bore
off
to
the
northwest
and
we
camped
that
night
some
distance
below
the
junction
of
the
former
creek
with
the
big
box
elder
before
our
watch
had
been
on
guard
twenty
minutes
that
night
we
heard
some
one
whistling
in
the
distance
and
as
whoever
it
was
refused
to
come
any
nearer
the
herd
a
thought
struck
me
and
i
rode
out
into
the
darkness
and
hailed
him
is
that
you
tom
came
the
question
to
my
challenge
and
the
next
minute
i
was
wringing
the
hand
of
my
old
bunkie
the
rebel
i
assured
him
that
the
coast
was
clear
and
that
no
inquiry
had
been
even
made
for
him
the
following
morning
when
crossing
the
yellowstone
by
any
of
the
inhabitants
of
frenchman
ford
he
returned
with
me
to
the
bed
ground
and
meeting
honeyman
as
he
circled
around
was
almost
unhorsed
by
the
latter
warmth
of
reception
and
officer
delight
on
meeting
my
bunkie
was
none
the
less
demonstrative
for
nearly
half
an
hour
he
rode
around
with
one
or
the
other
of
us
and
as
we
knew
he
had
had
little
if
any
sleep
for
the
last
three
nights
all
of
us
begged
him
to
go
on
into
camp
and
go
to
sleep
but
the
old
rascal
loafed
around
with
us
on
guard
seemingly
delighted
with
our
company
and
reluctant
to
leave
finally
honeyman
and
i
prevailed
on
him
to
go
to
the
wagon
but
before
leaving
us
he
said
why
i
been
in
sight
of
the
herd
for
the
last
day
and
night
but
i
getting
a
little
tired
of
lying
out
with
the
dry
cattle
these
cool
nights
and
living
on
huckleberries
and
grouse
so
i
thought
i
just
ride
in
and
get
a
fresh
horse
and
a
square
meal
once
more
but
if
flood
says
stay
you
see
me
at
my
old
place
on
the
point
had
the
owner
of
the
herd
suddenly
appeared
in
camp
he
could
not
have
received
such
an
ovation
as
was
extended
priest
the
next
morning
when
his
presence
became
known
from
the
cook
to
the
foreman
they
gathered
around
our
bed
where
the
rebel
sat
up
in
the
blankets
and
held
an
informal
reception
and
two
hours
afterward
he
was
riding
on
the
right
point
of
the
herd
as
if
nothing
had
happened
we
had
a
fair
trail
up
big
box
elder
and
for
the
following
few
days
or
until
the
source
of
that
creek
was
reached
met
nothing
to
check
our
course
our
foreman
had
been
riding
in
advance
of
the
herd
and
after
returning
to
us
at
noon
one
day
reported
that
the
trail
turned
a
due
northward
course
towards
the
missouri
and
all
herds
had
seemingly
taken
it
as
we
had
to
touch
at
fort
benton
which
was
almost
due
westward
he
had
concluded
to
quit
the
trail
and
try
to
intercept
the
military
road
running
from
fort
maginnis
to
benton
maginnis
lay
to
the
south
of
us
and
our
foreman
hoped
to
strike
the
military
road
at
an
angle
on
as
near
a
westward
course
as
possible
accordingly
after
dinner
he
set
out
to
look
out
the
country
and
took
me
with
him
we
bore
off
toward
the
missouri
and
within
half
an
hour
ride
after
leaving
the
trail
we
saw
some
loose
horses
about
three
miles
distant
down
in
a
little
valley
through
which
flowed
a
creek
towards
the
musselshell
we
reined
in
and
watched
the
horses
several
minutes
when
we
both
agreed
from
their
movements
that
they
were
hobbled
we
scouted
out
some
five
or
six
miles
finding
the
country
somewhat
rough
but
passable
for
a
herd
and
wagon
flood
was
anxious
to
investigate
those
hobbled
horses
for
it
bespoke
the
camp
of
some
one
in
the
immediate
vicinity
on
our
return
the
horses
were
still
in
view
and
with
no
little
difficulty
we
descended
from
the
mesa
into
the
valley
and
reached
them
to
our
agreeable
surprise
one
of
them
was
wearing
a
bell
while
nearly
half
of
them
were
hobbled
there
being
twelve
head
the
greater
portion
of
which
looked
like
pack
horses
supposing
the
camp
if
there
was
one
must
be
up
in
the
hills
we
followed
a
bridle
path
up
stream
in
search
of
it
and
soon
came
upon
four
men
placer
mining
on
the
banks
of
the
creek
when
we
made
our
errand
known
one
of
these
placer
miners
an
elderly
man
who
seemed
familiar
with
the
country
expressed
some
doubts
about
our
leaving
the
trail
though
he
said
there
was
a
bridle
path
with
which
he
was
acquainted
across
to
the
military
road
flood
at
once
offered
to
pay
him
well
if
he
would
pilot
us
across
to
the
road
or
near
enough
so
that
we
could
find
our
way
the
old
placerman
hesitated
and
after
consulting
among
his
partners
asked
how
we
were
fixed
for
provision
explaining
that
they
wished
to
remain
a
month
or
so
longer
and
that
game
had
been
scared
away
from
the
immediate
vicinity
until
it
had
become
hard
to
secure
meat
but
he
found
flood
ready
in
that
quarter
for
he
immediately
offered
to
kill
a
beef
and
load
down
any
two
pack
horses
they
had
if
he
would
consent
to
pilot
us
over
to
within
striking
distance
of
the
fort
benton
road
the
offer
was
immediately
accepted
and
i
was
dispatched
to
drive
in
their
horses
two
of
the
placer
miners
accompanied
us
back
to
the
trail
both
riding
good
saddle
horses
and
leading
two
others
under
pack
saddles
we
overtook
the
herd
within
a
mile
of
the
point
where
the
trail
was
to
be
abandoned
and
after
sending
the
wagon
ahead
our
foreman
asked
our
guests
to
pick
out
any
cow
or
steer
in
the
herd
when
they
declined
he
cut
out
a
fat
stray
cow
which
had
come
into
the
herd
down
on
the
north
platte
had
her
driven
in
after
the
wagon
killed
and
quartered
when
we
had
laid
the
quarters
on
convenient
rocks
to
cool
and
harden
during
the
night
our
future
pilot
timidly
inquired
what
we
proposed
to
do
with
the
hide
and
on
being
informed
that
he
was
welcome
to
it
seemed
delighted
remarking
as
i
helped
him
to
stake
it
out
where
it
would
dry
that
rawhide
was
mighty
handy
repairing
pack
saddles
our
visitors
interested
us
for
it
is
probable
that
not
a
man
in
our
outfit
had
ever
seen
a
miner
before
though
we
had
read
of
the
life
and
were
deeply
interested
in
everything
they
did
or
said
they
were
very
plain
men
and
of
simple
manners
but
we
had
great
difficulty
in
getting
them
to
talk
after
supper
while
idling
away
a
couple
of
hours
around
our
the
outfit
told
stories
in
the
hope
that
our
guests
would
become
reminiscent
and
give
us
some
insight
into
their
experiences
bob
blades
leading
off
i
was
in
a
cow
town
once
up
on
the
head
of
the
chisholm
trail
at
a
time
when
a
church
fair
was
being
pulled
off
there
were
lots
of
old
cowmen
living
in
the
town
who
owned
cattle
in
that
cherokee
strip
that
officer
is
always
talking
about
well
there
lots
of
folks
up
there
that
think
a
nigger
is
as
good
as
anybody
else
and
when
you
find
such
people
set
in
their
ways
it
best
not
to
argue
matters
with
them
but
lay
low
and
let
on
you
think
that
way
too
that
the
way
those
old
texas
cowmen
acted
about
it
well
at
this
church
fair
there
was
to
be
voted
a
prize
of
a
nice
baby
wagon
which
had
been
donated
by
some
merchant
to
the
prettiest
baby
under
a
year
old
colonel
bob
zellers
was
in
town
at
the
time
stopping
at
a
hotel
where
the
darky
cook
was
a
man
who
had
once
worked
for
him
on
the
trail
the
darky
had
married
when
he
quit
the
colonel
service
and
at
the
time
of
this
fair
there
was
a
pickaninny
in
his
family
about
a
year
old
and
nearly
the
color
of
a
new
saddle
a
few
of
these
old
cowmen
got
funny
and
thought
it
would
be
a
good
joke
to
have
frog
enter
his
baby
at
the
fair
and
colonel
bob
being
the
leader
in
the
movement
he
had
no
trouble
convincing
the
darky
that
that
baby
wagon
was
his
if
he
would
only
enter
his
youngster
frog
thought
the
world
of
the
old
colonel
and
the
latter
assured
him
that
he
would
vote
for
his
baby
while
he
had
a
dollar
or
a
cow
left
the
result
was
frog
gave
his
enthusiastic
consent
and
the
colonel
agreed
to
enter
the
pickaninny
in
the
contest
well
the
colonel
attended
to
the
entering
of
the
baby
name
and
then
on
the
dead
quiet
went
around
and
rustled
up
every
cowman
and
puncher
in
town
and
had
them
promise
to
be
on
hand
to
vote
for
the
prettiest
baby
at
ten
cents
a
throw
the
fair
was
being
held
in
the
largest
hall
in
town
and
at
the
appointed
hour
we
were
all
on
hand
as
well
as
frog
and
his
wife
and
baby
there
were
about
a
dozen
entries
and
only
one
blackbird
in
the
covey
the
list
of
contestants
was
read
by
the
minister
and
as
each
name
was
announced
there
was
a
vigorous
clapping
of
hands
all
over
the
house
by
the
friends
of
each
baby
but
when
the
name
of
miss
precilla
june
jones
was
announced
the
texas
contingent
made
their
presence
known
by
such
a
deafening
outburst
of
applause
that
old
frog
grinned
from
ear
to
ear
he
saw
himself
right
then
pushing
that
baby
wagon
well
on
the
first
heat
we
voted
sparingly
and
as
the
vote
was
read
out
about
every
quarter
hour
precilla
june
jones
on
the
first
turn
was
fourth
in
the
race
on
the
second
report
our
favorite
had
moved
up
to
third
place
after
which
the
weaker
ones
were
deserted
and
all
the
voting
blood
was
centered
on
the
two
white
leaders
with
our
blackbird
a
close
third
we
were
behaving
ourselves
nicely
and
our
money
was
welcome
if
we
were
when
the
third
vote
was
announced
frog
pickaninny
was
second
in
the
race
with
her
nose
lapped
on
the
flank
of
the
leader
then
those
who
thought
a
darky
was
as
good
as
any
one
else
got
on
the
prod
in
a
mild
form
and
you
could
hear
them
voicing
their
opinions
all
over
the
hall
we
heard
it
all
but
sat
as
nice
as
pie
and
never
said
a
word
when
the
final
vote
was
called
for
we
knew
it
was
the
home
stretch
and
every
rascal
of
us
got
his
weasel
skin
out
and
sweetened
the
voting
on
miss
precilla
june
jones
some
of
those
old
did
think
any
more
of
a
gold
piece
than
i
do
of
a
white
chip
especially
when
there
was
a
chance
to
give
those
good
people
a
dose
of
their
own
medicine
i
do
know
how
many
votes
we
cast
on
the
last
whirl
but
we
swamped
all
opposition
and
our
favorite
cantered
under
the
wire
an
easy
winner
then
you
should
have
heard
the
kicking
but
we
kept
still
and
inwardly
chuckled
the
minister
announced
the
winner
and
some
of
those
good
people
have
any
better
manners
than
to
hiss
and
cut
up
ugly
we
stayed
until
frog
got
the
new
baby
wagon
in
his
clutches
when
we
dropped
out
casually
and
met
at
the
ranch
saloon
where
colonel
zellers
had
taken
possession
behind
the
bar
and
was
dispensing
hospitality
in
proper
celebration
of
his
victory
much
to
our
disappointment
our
guests
remained
silent
and
showed
no
disposition
to
talk
except
to
answer
civil
questions
which
flood
asked
regarding
the
trail
crossing
on
the
missouri
and
what
that
river
was
like
in
the
vicinity
of
old
fort
benton
when
the
questions
had
been
answered
they
again
relapsed
into
silence
the
fire
was
replenished
and
after
the
conversation
had
touched
on
several
subjects
joe
stallings
took
his
turn
with
a
yarn
when
my
folks
first
came
to
texas
said
joe
they
settled
in
ellis
county
near
waxahachie
my
father
was
one
of
the
pioneers
in
that
county
at
a
time
when
his
nearest
neighbor
lived
ten
miles
from
his
front
gate
but
after
the
war
when
the
country
had
settled
up
these
old
pioneers
naturally
hung
together
and
visited
and
chummed
with
one
another
in
preference
to
the
new
settlers
one
spring
when
i
was
about
fifteen
years
old
one
of
those
old
pioneer
neighbors
of
ours
died
and
my
father
decided
that
he
would
go
to
the
funeral
or
burst
a
hame
string
if
any
of
you
know
anything
about
that
land
in
ellis
county
you
know
that
when
it
gets
muddy
in
the
spring
a
wagon
wheel
will
fill
solid
with
waxy
mud
so
at
the
time
of
this
funeral
it
was
impossible
to
go
on
the
road
with
any
kind
of
a
vehicle
and
my
father
had
to
go
on
horseback
he
was
an
old
man
at
the
time
and
did
like
the
idea
but
it
was
either
go
on
horseback
or
stay
at
home
and
go
he
would
they
raise
good
horses
in
ellis
county
and
my
father
had
raised
some
of
the
best
of
them
brought
the
stock
from
tennessee
he
liked
good
blood
in
a
horse
and
was
always
opposed
to
racing
but
he
raised
some
boys
who
were
i
had
a
number
of
brothers
older
than
myself
and
they
took
a
special
pride
in
trying
every
colt
we
raised
to
see
what
he
amounted
to
in
speed
of
course
this
had
to
be
done
away
from
home
but
that
was
easy
for
these
older
brothers
thought
nothing
of
riding
twenty
miles
to
a
tournament
barbecue
or
and
when
away
from
home
they
always
tried
their
horses
with
the
best
in
the
country
at
the
time
of
this
funeral
we
had
a
crackerjack
five
year
old
chestnut
sorrel
gelding
that
could
show
his
heels
to
any
horse
in
the
country
he
was
a
peach
you
could
turn
him
on
a
saddle
blanket
and
jump
him
fifteen
feet
and
that
cow
never
lived
that
he
could
cut
so
the
day
of
the
funeral
my
father
was
in
a
quandary
as
to
which
horse
to
ride
but
when
he
appealed
to
his
boys
they
recommended
the
best
on
the
ranch
which
was
the
chestnut
gelding
my
old
man
had
some
doubts
as
to
his
ability
to
ride
the
horse
for
he
had
been
on
a
horse
back
for
years
but
my
brothers
assured
him
that
the
chestnut
was
as
obedient
as
a
kitten
and
that
before
he
had
been
on
the
road
an
hour
the
mud
would
take
all
the
frisk
and
frolic
out
of
him
there
was
nearly
fifteen
miles
to
go
and
they
assured
him
that
he
would
never
get
there
if
he
rode
any
other
horse
well
at
last
he
consented
to
ride
the
gelding
and
the
horse
was
made
ready
properly
groomed
his
tail
tied
up
and
saddled
and
led
up
to
the
block
it
took
every
member
of
the
family
to
get
my
father
rigged
to
start
but
at
last
he
announced
himself
as
ready
two
of
my
brothers
held
the
horse
until
he
found
the
off
stirrup
and
then
they
turned
him
loose
the
chestnut
danced
off
a
few
rods
and
settled
down
into
a
steady
clip
that
was
good
for
five
or
six
miles
an
hour
my
father
reached
the
house
in
good
time
for
the
funeral
services
but
when
the
procession
started
for
the
burial
ground
the
horse
was
somewhat
restless
and
impatient
from
the
cold
there
was
quite
a
string
of
wagons
and
other
vehicles
from
the
immediate
neighborhood
which
had
braved
the
mud
and
the
line
was
nearly
half
a
mile
in
length
between
the
house
and
the
graveyard
there
were
also
possibly
a
hundred
men
on
horseback
bringing
up
the
rear
of
the
procession
and
the
chestnut
not
understanding
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
was
right
on
his
mettle
surrounded
as
he
was
by
other
horses
he
kept
his
weather
eye
open
for
a
race
for
in
coming
home
from
dances
and
picnics
with
my
brothers
he
had
often
been
tried
in
short
dashes
of
half
a
mile
or
so
in
order
to
get
him
out
of
the
crowd
of
horses
my
father
dropped
back
with
another
pioneer
to
the
extreme
rear
of
the
funeral
line
when
the
procession
was
nearing
the
cemetery
a
number
of
horsemen
who
were
late
galloped
up
in
the
rear
the
chestnut
supposing
a
race
was
on
took
the
bit
in
his
teeth
and
tore
down
past
the
procession
as
though
it
was
a
texas
sweepstakes
the
old
man
white
beard
whipping
the
breeze
in
his
endeavor
to
hold
in
the
horse
nor
did
he
check
him
until
the
head
of
the
procession
had
been
passed
when
my
father
returned
home
that
night
there
was
a
family
for
he
was
smoking
under
the
collar
of
course
my
brothers
denied
having
ever
run
the
horse
and
my
mother
took
their
part
but
the
old
gent
knew
a
thing
or
two
about
horses
and
shortly
afterwards
he
got
even
with
his
boys
by
selling
the
chestnut
which
broke
their
hearts
properly
the
elder
of
the
two
placer
miners
a
man
arose
and
after
walking
out
from
the
fire
some
distance
returned
and
called
our
attention
to
signs
in
the
sky
which
he
assured
us
were
a
sure
indication
of
a
change
in
the
weather
but
we
were
more
anxious
that
he
should
talk
about
something
else
for
we
were
in
the
habit
of
taking
the
weather
just
as
it
came
when
neither
one
showed
any
disposition
to
talk
flood
said
to
them
it
bedtime
with
us
and
one
of
you
can
sleep
with
me
while
i
fixed
up
an
extra
bed
for
the
other
i
generally
get
out
about
daybreak
but
if
that
too
early
for
you
do
let
my
getting
up
disturb
you
and
you
fourth
guard
men
let
the
cattle
off
the
bed
ground
on
a
due
westerly
course
and
point
them
up
the
divide
now
get
to
bed
everybody
for
we
want
to
make
a
big
drive
tomorrow
chapter
xxiii
delivery
i
shall
never
forget
the
next
morning
august
as
we
of
the
third
guard
were
relieved
about
two
hours
before
dawn
the
wind
veered
around
to
the
northwest
and
a
mist
which
had
been
falling
during
the
fore
part
of
our
watch
changed
to
soft
flakes
of
snow
as
soon
as
we
were
relieved
we
skurried
back
to
our
blankets
drew
the
tarpaulin
over
our
heads
and
slept
until
dawn
when
on
being
awakened
by
the
foreman
we
found
a
wet
slushy
snow
some
two
inches
in
depth
on
the
ground
several
of
the
boys
in
the
outfit
declared
it
was
the
first
snowfall
they
had
ever
seen
and
i
had
but
a
slight
recollection
of
having
witnessed
one
in
early
boyhood
in
our
old
georgia
home
we
gathered
around
the
fire
like
a
lot
of
frozen
children
and
our
only
solace
was
that
our
drive
was
nearing
an
end
the
two
placermen
paid
little
heed
to
the
raw
morning
and
our
pilot
assured
us
that
this
was
but
the
squaw
winter
which
always
preceded
indian
summer
we
made
our
customary
early
start
and
while
saddling
up
that
morning
flood
and
the
two
placer
miners
packed
the
beef
on
their
two
pack
horses
first
cutting
off
enough
to
last
us
several
days
the
cattle
when
we
overtook
them
presented
a
sorry
spectacle
apparently
being
as
cold
as
we
were
although
we
had
our
last
stitch
of
clothing
on
including
our
slickers
belted
with
a
horse
hobble
but
when
flood
and
our
guide
rode
past
the
herd
i
noticed
our
pilot
coat
was
not
even
buttoned
nor
was
the
thin
cotton
shirt
which
he
wore
but
his
chest
was
exposed
to
that
raw
morning
air
which
chilled
the
very
marrow
in
our
bones
our
foreman
and
guide
kept
in
sight
in
the
lead
the
herd
traveling
briskly
up
the
long
mountain
divide
and
about
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
the
sun
came
out
warm
and
the
snow
began
to
melt
within
an
hour
after
starting
that
morning
quince
forrest
who
was
riding
in
front
of
me
in
the
swing
dismounted
and
picking
out
of
the
snow
a
brave
little
flower
which
looked
something
like
a
pansy
dropped
back
to
me
and
said
my
weather
gauge
says
it
degrees
below
freezo
but
i
want
you
to
smell
this
posy
quirk
and
tell
me
on
the
dead
thieving
do
you
ever
expect
to
see
your
sunny
southern
home
again
and
did
you
notice
the
colonel
baring
his
brisket
to
the
morning
breeze
two
hours
after
the
sun
came
out
the
snow
had
disappeared
and
the
cattle
fell
to
and
grazed
until
long
after
the
noon
hour
our
pilot
led
us
up
the
divide
between
the
missouri
and
the
headwaters
of
the
musselshell
during
the
afternoon
weaving
in
and
out
around
the
heads
of
creeks
putting
into
either
river
and
towards
evening
we
crossed
quite
a
creek
running
towards
the
missouri
where
we
secured
ample
water
for
the
herd
we
made
a
late
camp
that
night
and
our
guide
assured
us
that
another
half
day
drive
would
put
us
on
the
judith
river
where
we
would
intercept
the
fort
benton
road
the
following
morning
our
guide
led
us
for
several
hours
up
a
gradual
ascent
to
the
plateau
till
we
reached
the
tableland
when
he
left
us
to
return
to
his
own
camp
flood
again
took
the
lead
and
within
a
mile
we
turned
on
our
regular
course
which
by
early
noon
had
descended
into
the
valley
of
the
judith
river
and
entered
the
fort
maginnis
and
benton
military
road
our
route
was
now
clearly
defined
and
about
noon
on
the
last
day
of
the
month
we
sighted
beyond
the
missouri
river
the
flag
floating
over
fort
benton
we
made
a
crossing
that
afternoon
below
the
fort
and
flood
went
into
the
post
expecting
either
to
meet
lovell
or
to
receive
our
final
instructions
regarding
the
delivery
after
crossing
the
missouri
we
grazed
the
herd
over
to
the
teton
river
a
stream
which
paralleled
the
former
watercourse
the
military
post
being
located
between
the
two
we
had
encamped
for
the
night
when
flood
returned
with
word
of
a
letter
he
had
received
from
our
employer
and
an
interview
he
had
had
with
the
commanding
officer
of
fort
benton
who
it
seemed
was
to
have
a
hand
in
the
delivery
of
the
herd
lovell
had
been
detained
in
the
final
settlement
of
my
brother
bob
herd
at
the
crow
agency
by
some
differences
regarding
weights
under
our
present
instructions
we
were
to
proceed
slowly
to
the
blackfoot
agency
and
immediately
on
the
arrival
of
lovell
at
benton
he
and
the
commandant
would
follow
by
ambulance
and
overtake
us
the
distance
from
fort
benton
to
the
agency
was
variously
reported
to
be
from
one
hundred
and
twenty
to
one
hundred
and
thirty
miles
six
or
seven
days
travel
for
the
herd
at
the
farthest
and
then
circle
dots
a
number
of
officers
and
troopers
from
the
post
overtook
us
the
next
morning
and
spent
several
hours
with
us
as
the
herd
trailed
out
up
the
teton
they
were
riding
fine
horses
which
made
our
through
saddle
stock
look
insignificant
in
comparison
though
had
they
covered
hundred
miles
and
lived
on
grass
as
had
our
mounts
some
of
the
lustre
of
their
glossy
coats
would
have
been
absent
they
looked
well
but
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
use
them
or
any
domestic
bred
horses
in
trail
work
like
ours
unless
a
supply
of
grain
could
be
carried
with
us
the
range
country
produced
a
horse
suitable
to
range
needs
hardy
and
a
good
forager
which
when
not
overworked
under
the
saddle
met
every
requirement
of
his
calling
as
well
as
being
our
horses
in
fact
were
in
better
flesh
when
we
crossed
the
missouri
than
they
were
the
day
we
received
the
herd
on
the
rio
grande
the
spectators
from
the
fort
quitted
us
near
the
middle
of
the
forenoon
and
we
snailed
on
westward
at
our
leisurely
gait
there
was
a
fair
road
up
the
teton
which
we
followed
for
several
days
without
incident
to
the
forks
of
that
river
where
we
turned
up
muddy
creek
the
north
fork
of
the
teton
that
noon
while
catching
saddle
horses
dinner
not
being
quite
ready
we
noticed
a
flurry
amongst
the
cattle
then
almost
a
mile
in
our
rear
two
men
were
on
herd
with
them
as
usual
grazing
them
forward
up
the
creek
and
watering
as
they
came
when
suddenly
the
cattle
in
the
lead
came
tearing
out
of
the
creek
and
on
reaching
open
ground
turned
at
bay
after
several
bunches
had
seemingly
taken
fright
at
the
same
object
we
noticed
bull
durham
who
was
on
herd
ride
through
the
cattle
to
the
scene
of
disturbance
we
saw
him
on
nearing
the
spot
lie
down
on
the
neck
of
his
horse
watch
intently
for
several
minutes
then
quietly
drop
back
to
the
rear
circle
the
herd
and
ride
for
the
wagon
we
had
been
observing
the
proceedings
closely
though
from
a
distance
for
some
time
daylight
was
evidently
all
that
saved
us
from
a
stampede
and
as
bull
durham
galloped
up
he
was
almost
breathless
he
informed
us
that
an
old
cinnamon
bear
and
two
cubs
were
berrying
along
the
creek
and
had
taken
the
right
of
way
then
there
was
a
hustling
and
borrowing
of
cartridges
while
saddles
were
cinched
on
to
horses
as
though
human
life
depended
on
alacrity
we
were
all
feeling
quite
gala
anyhow
and
this
looked
like
a
chance
for
some
sport
it
was
hard
to
hold
the
impulsive
ones
in
check
until
the
others
were
ready
the
cattle
pointed
us
to
the
location
of
the
quarry
as
we
rode
forward
when
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
we
separated
into
two
squads
in
order
to
gain
the
rear
of
the
bears
cut
them
off
from
the
creek
and
force
them
into
the
open
the
cattle
held
the
attention
of
the
bears
until
we
had
gained
their
rear
and
as
we
came
up
between
them
and
the
creek
the
old
one
reared
up
on
her
haunches
and
took
a
most
astonished
and
innocent
look
at
us
a
single
woof
brought
one
of
the
cubs
to
her
side
and
she
dropped
on
all
fours
and
lumbered
off
a
half
dozen
shots
hastening
her
pace
in
an
effort
to
circle
the
horsemen
who
were
gradually
closing
in
in
making
this
circle
to
gain
the
protection
of
some
thickets
which
skirted
the
creek
she
was
compelled
to
cross
quite
an
open
space
and
before
she
had
covered
the
distance
of
fifty
yards
a
rain
of
ropes
came
down
on
her
and
she
was
thrown
backward
with
no
less
than
four
lariats
fastened
over
her
neck
and
fore
parts
then
ensued
a
lively
scene
for
the
horses
snorted
and
in
spite
of
rowels
refused
to
face
the
bear
but
ropes
securely
snubbed
to
pommels
held
them
to
the
quarry
two
minor
circuses
were
meantime
in
progress
with
the
two
cubs
but
pressure
of
duty
held
those
of
us
who
had
fastened
on
to
the
old
cinnamon
the
ropes
were
taut
and
several
of
them
were
about
her
throat
the
horses
were
pulling
in
as
many
different
directions
yet
the
strain
of
all
the
lariats
failed
to
choke
her
as
we
expected
at
this
juncture
four
of
the
loose
men
came
to
our
rescue
and
proposed
shooting
the
brute
we
were
willing
enough
for
though
we
had
better
than
a
tail
hold
we
were
very
ready
to
let
go
but
while
there
were
plenty
of
good
shots
among
us
our
horses
had
now
become
wary
and
could
not
when
free
from
ropes
be
induced
to
approach
within
twenty
yards
of
the
bear
and
they
were
so
fidgety
that
accurate
aim
was
impossible
we
who
had
ropes
on
the
old
bear
begged
the
boys
to
get
down
and
take
it
afoot
but
they
were
not
disposed
to
listen
to
our
reasons
and
blazed
away
from
rearing
horses
not
one
shot
in
ten
taking
effect
there
was
no
telling
how
long
this
random
shooting
would
have
lasted
but
one
shot
cut
my
rope
two
feet
from
the
noose
and
with
one
rope
less
on
her
the
old
bear
made
some
ugly
surges
and
had
not
joe
stallings
had
a
wheeler
of
a
horse
on
the
rope
she
would
have
done
somebody
damage
the
rebel
was
on
the
opposite
side
from
stallings
and
myself
and
as
soon
as
i
was
freed
he
called
me
around
to
him
and
shifting
his
rope
to
me
borrowed
my
and
joined
those
who
were
shooting
dismounting
he
gave
the
reins
of
his
horse
to
flood
walked
up
to
within
fifteen
steps
of
mother
bruin
and
kneeling
emptied
both
with
telling
accuracy
the
old
bear
winced
at
nearly
every
shot
and
once
she
made
an
ugly
surge
on
the
ropes
but
the
three
guy
lines
held
her
up
to
priest
deliberate
aim
the
vitality
of
that
cinnamon
almost
staggers
belief
for
after
both
had
been
emptied
into
her
body
she
floundered
on
the
ropes
with
all
her
former
strength
although
the
blood
was
dripping
and
gushing
from
her
numerous
wounds
borrowing
a
third
gun
priest
returned
to
the
fight
and
as
we
slacked
the
ropes
slightly
the
old
bear
reared
facing
her
antagonist
the
rebel
emptied
his
third
gun
into
her
before
she
sank
choked
bleeding
and
exhausted
to
the
ground
and
even
then
no
one
dared
to
approach
her
for
she
struck
out
wildly
with
all
fours
as
she
slowly
succumbed
to
the
inevitable
one
of
the
cubs
had
been
roped
and
afterwards
shot
at
close
quarters
while
the
other
had
reached
the
creek
and
climbed
a
sapling
which
grew
on
the
bank
when
a
few
shots
brought
him
to
the
ground
the
two
cubs
were
about
the
size
of
a
small
black
bear
though
the
mother
was
a
large
specimen
of
her
species
the
cubs
had
nice
coats
of
soft
fur
and
their
hides
were
taken
as
trophies
of
the
fight
but
the
robe
of
the
mother
was
a
summer
one
and
worthless
while
we
were
skinning
the
cubs
the
foreman
called
our
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
herd
had
drifted
up
the
creek
nearly
opposite
the
wagon
during
the
encounter
with
the
bears
he
was
the
most
excited
one
in
the
outfit
and
was
the
man
who
cut
my
rope
with
his
random
shooting
from
horseback
but
now
the
herd
recovered
his
attention
and
he
dispatched
some
of
us
to
ride
around
the
cattle
when
we
met
at
the
wagon
for
dinner
the
excitement
was
still
on
us
and
the
hunt
was
unanimously
voted
the
most
exciting
bit
of
sport
and
powder
burning
we
had
experienced
on
our
trip
late
that
afternoon
a
forage
wagon
from
fort
benton
passed
us
with
four
loose
ambulance
mules
in
charge
of
five
troopers
who
were
going
on
ahead
to
establish
a
relay
station
in
anticipation
of
the
trip
of
the
post
commandant
to
the
blackfoot
agency
there
were
to
be
two
relay
stations
between
the
post
and
the
agency
and
this
detachment
expected
to
go
into
camp
that
night
within
forty
miles
of
our
destination
there
to
await
the
arrival
of
the
commanding
officer
and
the
owner
of
the
herd
at
benton
these
soldiers
were
out
two
days
from
the
post
when
they
passed
us
and
they
assured
us
that
the
ambulance
would
go
through
from
benton
to
blackfoot
without
a
halt
except
for
the
changing
of
relay
teams
the
next
forenoon
we
passed
the
last
relay
camp
well
up
the
muddy
and
shortly
afterwards
the
road
left
that
creek
turning
north
by
a
little
west
and
we
entered
on
the
last
tack
of
our
long
drive
on
the
evening
of
the
of
september
as
we
were
going
into
camp
on
two
medicine
creek
within
ten
miles
of
the
agency
the
ambulance
overtook
us
under
escort
of
the
troopers
whom
we
had
passed
at
the
last
relay
station
we
had
not
seen
don
lovell
since
june
when
we
passed
dodge
and
it
goes
without
saying
that
we
were
glad
to
meet
him
again
on
the
arrival
of
the
party
the
cattle
had
not
yet
been
bedded
so
lovell
borrowed
a
horse
and
with
flood
took
a
look
over
the
herd
before
darkness
set
in
having
previously
prevailed
on
the
commanding
officer
to
rest
an
hour
and
have
supper
before
proceeding
to
the
agency
when
they
returned
from
inspecting
the
cattle
the
commandant
and
lovell
agreed
to
make
the
final
delivery
on
the
if
it
were
agreeable
to
the
agent
and
with
this
understanding
continued
their
journey
the
next
morning
flood
rode
into
the
agency
borrowing
mccann
saddle
and
taking
an
extra
horse
with
him
having
left
us
instructions
to
graze
the
herd
all
day
and
have
them
in
good
shape
with
grass
and
water
in
case
they
were
inspected
that
evening
on
their
condition
near
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
quite
a
cavalcade
rode
out
from
the
agency
including
part
of
a
company
of
cavalry
temporarily
encamped
there
the
indian
agent
and
the
commanding
officer
from
benton
were
the
authorized
representatives
of
the
government
it
seemed
as
lovell
took
extra
pains
in
showing
them
over
the
herd
frequently
consulting
the
contract
which
he
held
regarding
sex
age
and
flesh
of
the
cattle
the
only
hitch
in
the
inspection
was
over
a
number
of
cattle
which
was
unavoidable
after
such
a
long
journey
but
the
condition
of
these
animals
being
otherwise
satisfactory
lovell
urged
the
agent
and
commandant
to
call
up
the
men
for
explanations
the
agent
was
no
doubt
a
very
nice
man
and
there
may
have
been
other
things
that
he
understood
better
than
cattle
for
he
did
ask
a
great
many
simple
innocent
questions
our
replies
however
might
have
been
condensed
into
a
few
simple
statements
we
had
we
related
been
over
five
months
on
the
trail
after
the
first
month
cattle
began
to
appear
from
time
to
time
in
the
herd
as
stony
or
gravelly
portions
of
the
trail
were
encountered
the
number
so
affected
at
any
one
time
varying
from
ten
to
forty
head
frequently
lead
cattle
became
tender
in
their
feet
and
would
drop
back
to
the
rear
and
on
striking
soft
or
sandy
footing
recover
and
resume
their
position
in
the
lead
that
since
starting
it
was
safe
to
say
fully
ten
per
cent
of
the
entire
herd
had
been
so
affected
yet
we
had
not
lost
a
single
head
from
this
cause
that
the
general
health
of
the
animal
was
never
affected
and
that
during
enforced
layovers
nearly
all
so
affected
recovered
as
there
were
not
over
animals
in
the
herd
on
our
arrival
our
explanation
was
sufficient
and
the
herd
was
accepted
there
yet
remained
the
counting
and
classification
but
as
this
would
require
time
it
went
over
until
the
following
day
the
cows
had
been
contracted
for
by
the
head
while
the
steers
went
on
their
estimated
weight
in
dressed
beef
the
contract
calling
for
a
million
pounds
with
a
ten
per
cent
leeway
over
that
amount
i
was
amongst
the
first
to
be
interviewed
by
the
indian
agent
and
on
being
excused
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
one
of
two
priests
who
were
with
the
party
he
was
a
old
padre
who
informed
me
that
he
had
been
stationed
among
the
blackfeet
for
over
twenty
years
and
that
he
had
labored
long
with
the
government
to
assist
these
indians
the
cows
in
our
herd
which
were
to
be
distributed
amongst
the
indian
families
for
domestic
purposes
were
there
at
his
earnest
solicitation
i
asked
him
if
these
cows
would
not
perish
during
the
long
winter
my
recollection
was
still
vivid
of
the
touch
of
squaw
winter
we
had
experienced
some
two
weeks
previous
but
he
assured
me
that
the
winters
were
dry
if
cold
and
his
people
had
made
some
progress
in
the
ways
of
civilization
and
had
provided
shelter
and
forage
against
the
wintry
weather
he
informed
me
that
previous
to
his
labors
amongst
the
blackfeet
their
ponies
wintered
without
loss
on
the
native
grasses
though
he
had
since
taught
them
to
make
hay
and
in
anticipation
of
receiving
these
cows
such
families
as
were
entitled
to
share
in
the
division
had
amply
provided
for
the
animals
sustenance
lovell
returned
with
the
party
to
the
agency
and
we
were
to
bring
up
the
herd
for
classification
early
in
the
morning
flood
informed
us
that
a
beef
pasture
had
been
built
that
summer
for
the
steers
while
the
cows
would
be
held
under
herd
by
the
military
pending
their
distribution
we
spent
our
last
night
with
the
herd
singing
songs
until
the
first
guard
called
the
relief
when
realizing
the
lateness
of
the
hour
we
burrowed
into
our
blankets
i
do
know
how
you
fellows
feel
about
it
said
quince
forrest
when
the
first
guard
were
relieved
and
they
had
returned
to
camp
but
i
bade
those
cows
on
their
beds
without
a
regret
or
a
tear
the
novelty
of
loses
its
charm
with
me
when
drawn
out
over
five
months
i
might
be
fool
enough
to
make
another
such
trip
but
i
rather
be
the
indian
and
let
the
other
fellow
drive
the
cows
to
me
there
a
heap
more
comfort
in
it
the
next
morning
before
we
reached
the
agency
a
number
of
gaudily
bedecked
bucks
and
squaws
rode
out
to
meet
us
the
arrival
of
the
herd
had
been
expected
for
several
weeks
and
our
approach
was
a
delight
to
the
indians
who
were
flocking
to
the
agency
from
the
nearest
villages
physically
they
were
fine
specimens
of
the
aborigines
but
our
spanish
which
quarternight
and
i
tried
on
them
was
as
unintelligible
to
them
as
their
guttural
gibberish
was
to
us
lovell
and
the
agent
with
a
detachment
of
the
cavalry
met
us
about
a
mile
from
the
agency
buildings
and
we
were
ordered
to
cut
out
the
cows
the
herd
had
been
grazed
to
contentment
and
were
accordingly
rounded
in
and
the
task
begun
at
once
our
entire
outfit
were
turned
into
the
herd
to
do
the
work
while
an
abundance
of
troopers
held
the
herd
and
looked
after
the
cut
it
took
about
an
hour
and
a
half
during
which
time
we
worked
like
trojans
cavalrymen
several
times
attempted
to
assist
us
but
their
horses
were
no
match
for
ours
in
the
work
a
cow
can
turn
on
much
less
space
than
a
cavalry
horse
and
except
for
the
amusement
they
afforded
the
military
were
of
very
little
effect
after
we
had
retrimmed
the
cut
the
beeves
were
started
for
their
pasture
and
nothing
now
remained
but
the
counting
to
complete
the
receiving
four
of
us
remained
behind
with
the
cows
but
for
over
two
hours
the
steers
were
in
plain
sight
while
the
two
parties
were
endeavoring
to
make
a
count
how
many
times
they
recounted
them
before
agreeing
on
the
numbers
i
do
not
know
for
the
four
of
us
left
with
the
cows
became
occupied
by
a
controversy
over
the
sex
of
a
young
indian
a
blackfoot
riding
a
pony
the
controversy
originated
between
fox
quarternight
and
bob
blades
who
had
discovered
this
swell
among
a
band
who
had
just
ridden
in
from
the
west
and
john
officer
and
myself
were
appealed
to
for
our
opinions
the
indian
was
pointed
out
to
us
across
the
herd
easily
distinguished
by
beads
and
beaver
fur
trimmings
in
the
hair
so
we
rode
around
to
pass
our
judgment
as
experts
on
the
beauty
the
young
indian
was
not
over
sixteen
years
of
age
with
remarkable
features
from
which
every
trace
of
the
aborigine
seemed
to
be
eliminated
officer
and
myself
were
in
a
quandary
for
we
felt
perfectly
competent
when
appealed
to
for
our
opinions
on
such
a
delicate
subject
and
we
made
every
endeavor
to
open
a
conversation
by
signs
and
speech
but
the
young
blackfoot
paid
no
attention
to
us
being
intent
upon
watching
the
cows
the
neatly
moccasined
feet
and
the
shapely
hand
however
indicated
the
feminine
and
when
blades
and
rode
up
we
rendered
our
decision
accordingly
blades
took
exception
to
the
decision
and
rode
alongside
the
young
indian
pretending
to
admire
the
long
plaits
of
hair
toyed
with
the
beads
pinched
and
patted
the
young
blackfoot
and
finally
although
the
rest
of
us
for
fear
the
indian
might
take
offense
and
raise
trouble
pleaded
with
him
to
desist
he
called
the
youth
his
squaw
when
the
young
blood
evidently
understanding
the
appellation
relaxed
into
a
broad
smile
and
in
fair
english
said
me
buck
blades
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
at
his
success
at
which
the
indian
smiled
but
accepted
a
cigarette
and
the
two
cronied
together
while
we
rode
away
to
look
after
our
cows
the
outfit
returned
shortly
afterward
when
the
rebel
rode
up
to
me
and
expressed
himself
rather
profanely
at
the
inability
of
the
government
representatives
to
count
cattle
in
texas
fashion
on
the
arrival
of
the
agent
and
others
the
cows
were
brought
around
and
these
being
much
more
gentle
and
being
under
lovell
instruction
fed
between
the
counters
in
the
narrowest
file
possible
a
satisfactory
count
was
agreed
upon
at
the
first
trial
the
troopers
took
charge
of
the
cows
after
counting
and
our
work
over
we
galloped
away
to
the
wagon
hilarious
and
care
free
mccann
had
camped
on
the
nearest
water
to
the
agency
and
after
dinner
we
caught
out
the
top
horses
and
dressed
in
our
best
rode
into
the
agency
proper
there
was
quite
a
group
of
houses
for
the
attachés
one
large
general
warehouse
and
several
school
and
chapel
buildings
i
again
met
the
old
padre
who
showed
us
over
the
place
one
could
not
help
being
favorably
impressed
with
the
general
neatness
and
cleanliness
of
the
place
in
answer
to
our
questions
the
priest
informed
us
that
he
had
mastered
the
indian
language
early
in
his
work
and
had
adopted
it
in
his
ministry
the
better
to
effect
the
object
of
his
mission
there
was
something
touching
in
the
zeal
of
this
devoted
padre
in
his
work
amongst
the
tribe
and
the
recognition
of
the
government
had
come
as
a
fitting
climax
to
his
work
and
devotion
as
we
rode
away
from
the
agency
the
cows
being
in
sight
under
herd
of
a
dozen
soldiers
several
of
us
rode
out
to
them
and
learned
that
they
intended
to
corral
the
cows
at
night
and
within
a
week
distribute
them
to
indian
families
when
the
troop
expected
to
return
to
fort
benton
lovell
and
flood
appeared
at
the
camp
about
dusk
lovell
in
high
spirits
this
he
said
was
the
easiest
delivery
of
the
three
herds
which
he
had
driven
that
year
he
was
justified
in
feeling
well
over
the
year
drive
for
he
had
in
his
possession
a
voucher
for
our
circle
dots
which
would
crowd
six
figures
closely
it
was
a
gay
night
with
us
for
man
and
horse
were
free
and
as
we
made
down
our
beds
old
man
don
insisted
that
flood
and
he
should
make
theirs
down
alongside
ours
he
and
the
rebel
had
been
joking
each
other
during
the
evening
and
as
we
went
to
bed
were
taking
an
occasional
fling
at
one
another
as
opportunity
offered
it
a
strange
thing
to
me
said
lovell
as
he
was
pulling
off
his
boots
that
this
herd
counted
out
a
hundred
and
twelve
head
more
than
we
started
with
while
bob
quirk
herd
was
only
long
at
the
final
count
well
you
see
replied
the
rebel
quirk
was
a
steer
herd
while
ours
had
over
a
thousand
cows
in
it
and
you
must
make
allowance
for
some
of
them
to
calve
on
the
way
that
ought
to
be
easy
figuring
for
a
foxy
yank
like
you
chapter
xxiv
back
to
texas
the
nearest
railroad
point
from
the
blackfoot
agency
was
silver
bow
about
a
hundred
and
miles
due
south
and
at
that
time
the
terminal
of
the
utah
northern
railroad
everything
connected
with
the
delivery
having
been
completed
the
previous
day
our
camp
was
astir
with
the
dawn
in
preparation
for
departure
on
our
last
ride
together
as
we
expected
to
make
not
less
than
forty
miles
a
day
on
the
way
to
the
railroad
our
wagon
was
lightened
to
the
least
possible
weight
the
water
kegs
and
such
superfluities
were
dropped
and
the
supplies
reduced
to
one
week
allowance
while
beds
were
overhauled
and
extra
wearing
apparel
of
the
outfit
was
discarded
who
cared
if
we
did
sleep
cold
and
had
a
change
to
our
backs
we
were
going
home
and
would
have
money
in
our
pockets
the
first
thing
i
do
when
we
strike
that
town
of
silver
bow
said
bull
durham
as
he
was
putting
on
his
last
shirt
is
to
discard
to
the
skin
and
get
me
new
togs
to
a
finish
i
commence
on
my
little
pattering
feet
which
will
require
moccasins
and
then
about
a
checked
cottonade
suit
and
top
off
with
a
brown
stetson
then
with
a
few
drinks
under
my
belt
and
a
cigar
in
my
mouth
i
admire
to
meet
the
governor
of
montana
if
convenient
before
the
sun
was
an
hour
high
we
bade
farewell
to
the
blackfoot
agency
and
were
doubling
back
over
the
trail
with
lovell
in
our
company
our
first
night
camp
was
on
the
muddy
and
the
second
on
the
sun
river
we
were
sweeping
across
the
tablelands
adjoining
the
main
divide
of
the
rocky
mountains
like
the
chinook
winds
which
sweep
that
majestic
range
on
its
western
slope
we
were
a
free
outfit
even
the
cook
and
wrangler
were
relieved
their
little
duties
were
divided
among
the
crowd
and
almost
disappeared
there
was
a
keen
rivalry
over
driving
the
wagon
and
mccann
was
transferred
to
the
hurricane
deck
of
a
cow
horse
which
he
sat
with
ease
and
grace
having
served
an
apprenticeship
in
the
saddle
in
other
days
there
were
always
half
a
dozen
wranglers
available
in
the
morning
and
we
traveled
as
if
under
forced
marching
orders
the
third
night
we
camped
in
the
narrows
between
the
missouri
river
and
the
rocky
mountains
and
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
camped
several
miles
to
the
eastward
of
helena
the
capital
of
the
territory
don
lovell
had
taken
the
stage
for
the
capital
the
night
before
and
on
making
camp
that
evening
flood
took
a
fresh
horse
and
rode
into
town
the
next
morning
he
and
lovell
returned
with
the
superintendent
of
the
cattle
company
which
had
contracted
for
our
horses
and
outfit
on
the
republican
we
corralled
the
horses
for
him
and
after
roping
out
about
a
dozen
which
as
having
sore
backs
or
being
lame
he
proposed
to
treat
as
damaged
and
take
at
half
price
the
was
counted
out
a
hundred
and
forty
saddle
horses
four
mules
and
a
wagon
constituting
the
transfer
even
with
the
loss
of
two
horses
and
the
concessions
on
a
dozen
others
there
was
a
nice
profit
on
the
entire
outfit
over
its
cost
in
the
lower
country
due
to
the
foresight
of
don
lovell
in
mounting
us
well
two
of
our
fellows
who
had
borrowed
from
the
superintendent
money
to
redeem
their
after
the
horse
race
on
the
republican
authorized
lovell
to
return
him
the
loans
and
thanked
him
for
the
favor
everything
being
satisfactory
between
buyer
and
seller
they
returned
to
town
together
for
a
settlement
while
we
moved
on
south
towards
silver
bow
where
the
outfit
was
to
be
delivered
another
day
easy
travel
brought
us
to
within
a
mile
of
the
railroad
terminus
but
it
also
brought
us
to
one
of
the
hardest
experiences
of
our
trip
for
each
of
us
knew
as
we
unsaddled
our
horses
that
we
were
doing
it
for
the
last
time
although
we
were
in
the
best
of
spirits
over
the
successful
conclusion
of
the
drive
although
we
were
glad
to
be
free
from
herd
duty
and
looked
forward
eagerly
to
the
journey
home
there
was
still
a
feeling
of
regret
in
our
hearts
which
we
could
not
dispel
in
the
days
of
my
boyhood
i
have
shed
tears
when
a
favorite
horse
was
sold
from
our
little
ranch
on
the
san
antonio
and
have
frequently
witnessed
mexican
children
unable
to
hide
their
grief
when
need
of
bread
had
compelled
the
sale
of
some
favorite
horse
to
a
passing
drover
but
at
no
time
in
my
life
before
or
since
have
i
felt
so
keenly
the
parting
between
man
and
horse
as
i
did
that
september
evening
in
montana
for
on
the
trail
an
affection
springs
up
between
a
man
and
his
mount
which
is
almost
human
every
privation
which
he
endures
his
horse
endures
with
him
carrying
him
through
falling
weather
swimming
rivers
by
day
and
riding
in
the
lead
of
stampedes
by
night
always
faithful
always
willing
and
always
patiently
enduring
every
hardship
from
exhausting
hours
under
saddle
to
the
sufferings
of
a
dry
drive
and
on
this
drive
covering
nearly
three
thousand
miles
all
the
ties
which
can
exist
between
man
and
beast
had
not
only
become
cemented
but
our
as
a
whole
had
won
the
affection
of
both
men
and
employer
for
carrying
without
serious
mishap
a
valuable
herd
all
the
way
from
the
rio
grande
to
the
blackfoot
agency
their
hones
may
be
bleaching
in
some
coulee
by
now
but
the
men
who
knew
them
then
can
never
forget
them
or
the
part
they
played
in
that
long
drive
three
men
from
the
ranch
rode
into
our
camp
that
evening
and
the
next
morning
we
counted
over
our
horses
to
them
and
they
passed
into
strangers
hands
that
there
might
he
no
delay
flood
had
ridden
into
town
the
evening
before
and
secured
a
wagon
and
gunny
bags
in
which
to
sack
our
saddles
for
while
we
willingly
discarded
all
other
effects
our
saddles
were
of
sufficient
value
to
return
and
could
be
checked
home
as
baggage
our
foreman
reported
that
lovell
had
arrived
by
stage
and
was
awaiting
us
in
town
having
already
arranged
for
our
transportation
as
far
as
omaha
and
would
accompany
us
to
that
city
where
other
transportation
would
have
to
be
secured
to
our
destination
in
our
impatience
to
get
into
town
we
were
trudging
in
by
twos
and
threes
before
the
wagon
arrived
for
our
saddles
and
had
not
flood
remained
behind
to
look
after
them
they
might
have
been
abandoned
there
was
something
about
silver
bow
that
reminded
me
of
ford
on
the
yellowstone
being
the
terminal
of
the
first
railroad
into
montana
it
became
the
distributing
point
for
all
the
western
portion
of
that
territory
and
immense
ox
trains
were
in
sight
for
the
transportation
of
goods
to
remoter
points
in
the
north
and
west
the
population
too
was
very
much
the
same
as
at
frenchman
though
the
town
in
general
was
an
improvement
over
the
former
there
being
some
stability
to
its
buildings
as
we
were
to
leave
on
an
eleven
train
we
had
little
opportunity
to
see
the
town
and
for
the
short
time
at
our
disposal
barber
shops
and
clothing
stores
claimed
our
first
attention
most
of
us
had
some
remnants
of
money
while
my
bunkie
was
positively
rich
and
lovell
advanced
us
fifty
dollars
apiece
pending
a
final
settlement
on
reaching
our
destination
within
an
hour
after
receiving
the
money
we
blossomed
out
in
new
suits
from
head
to
heel
our
guard
hung
together
as
if
we
were
still
on
night
herd
and
in
the
selection
of
clothing
the
opinion
of
the
trio
was
equal
to
a
purchase
the
rebel
was
very
easily
pleased
in
his
selection
but
john
officer
and
myself
were
rather
fastidious
officer
was
so
tall
it
was
with
some
little
difficulty
that
a
suit
could
be
found
to
fit
him
and
when
he
had
stuffed
his
pants
in
his
boots
and
thrown
away
the
vest
for
he
never
wore
either
vest
or
suspenders
he
emerged
looking
like
an
alpine
tourist
with
his
new
pink
shirt
and
nappy
brown
beaver
slouch
hat
jauntily
cocked
over
one
ear
as
we
sauntered
out
into
the
street
priest
was
dressed
as
became
his
years
and
mature
good
sense
while
my
costume
rivaled
officer
in
gaudiness
and
it
is
safe
to
assert
two
thirds
of
our
outlay
had
gone
for
boots
and
hats
flood
overtook
us
in
the
street
and
warned
us
to
be
on
hand
at
the
depot
at
least
half
an
hour
in
advance
of
train
time
informing
us
that
he
had
checked
our
saddles
and
did
want
any
of
us
to
get
left
at
the
final
moment
we
all
took
a
drink
together
and
officer
assured
our
foreman
that
he
would
be
responsible
for
our
appearance
at
the
proper
time
sober
and
sorry
for
it
so
we
sauntered
about
the
straggling
village
drinking
occasionally
and
on
the
suggestion
of
the
rebel
made
a
cow
by
putting
in
five
apiece
and
had
officer
play
it
on
faro
he
claiming
to
be
an
expert
on
the
game
taking
the
purse
thus
made
up
john
sat
into
a
game
while
priest
and
myself
after
watching
the
play
some
minutes
strolled
out
again
and
met
others
of
our
outfit
in
the
street
scarcely
recognizable
in
their
killing
rigs
the
rebel
was
itching
for
a
monte
game
but
this
not
being
a
cow
town
there
was
none
and
we
strolled
next
into
a
saloon
where
a
piano
was
being
played
by
a
individual
who
proved
quite
amiable
taking
a
drink
with
us
and
favoring
us
with
a
number
of
selections
of
our
choosing
we
were
enjoying
this
musical
treat
when
our
foreman
came
in
and
asked
us
to
get
the
boys
together
priest
and
i
at
once
started
for
officer
whom
we
found
quite
a
winner
but
succeeded
in
choking
him
off
on
our
employer
order
and
after
the
checks
had
been
cashed
took
a
parting
drink
which
made
us
the
last
in
reaching
the
depot
when
we
were
all
assembled
our
employer
informed
us
that
he
only
wished
to
keep
us
together
until
embarking
and
invited
us
to
accompany
him
across
the
street
to
tom
saloon
on
entering
the
saloon
lovell
inquired
of
the
young
fellow
behind
the
bar
son
what
will
you
take
for
the
privilege
of
my
entertaining
this
outfit
for
fifteen
minutes
the
ranch
is
yours
sir
and
you
can
name
your
own
figures
smilingly
and
somewhat
shrewdly
replied
the
young
fellow
and
promptly
vacated
his
position
now
two
or
three
of
you
rascals
get
in
behind
there
said
old
man
don
as
a
quartet
of
the
boys
picked
him
up
and
set
him
on
one
end
of
the
bar
and
let
see
what
this
ranch
has
in
the
way
of
refreshment
mccann
quarternight
and
myself
obeyed
the
order
but
the
fastidious
tastes
of
the
line
in
front
soon
compelled
us
to
call
to
our
assistance
both
robbins
and
the
young
man
who
had
just
vacated
the
bar
in
our
favor
that
right
fellows
roared
lovell
from
his
commanding
position
as
he
jingled
a
handful
of
gold
coins
turn
to
and
help
wait
on
these
thirsty
texans
and
remember
that
nothing
too
rich
for
our
blood
this
outfit
has
made
one
of
the
longest
cattle
drives
on
record
and
the
best
is
none
too
good
for
them
so
set
out
your
best
for
they
ca
cut
much
hole
in
the
profits
in
the
short
time
we
have
to
stay
the
train
leaves
in
twenty
minutes
and
see
that
every
rascal
is
provided
with
an
extra
bottle
for
the
journey
and
drop
down
this
way
when
you
get
time
as
i
want
a
couple
of
boxes
of
your
best
cigars
to
smoke
on
the
way
montana
has
treated
us
well
and
we
want
to
leave
some
of
our
coin
with
you
