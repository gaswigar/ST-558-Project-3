and
it
has
not
commonly
been
the
lot
of
philosophers
as
it
is
of
great
poets
that
their
names
should
become
household
words
we
should
hardly
call
an
englishman
well
read
if
he
had
not
heard
the
name
of
sophocles
or
molière
an
educated
man
is
expected
to
know
at
least
who
these
great
writers
were
and
to
understand
an
allusion
to
the
or
but
we
call
a
man
well
read
if
his
mind
is
stored
with
the
verse
of
poets
and
the
prose
of
historians
even
though
he
were
ignorant
of
the
name
of
descartes
or
kant
yet
there
are
a
few
philosophers
whose
influence
on
thought
and
language
has
been
so
extensive
that
no
one
who
reads
can
be
ignorant
of
their
names
and
that
every
man
who
speaks
the
language
of
educated
europeans
is
constantly
using
their
vocabulary
among
this
few
aristotle
holds
not
the
lowest
place
we
have
all
heard
of
him
as
we
have
all
heard
of
homer
he
has
left
his
impress
so
firmly
on
theology
that
many
of
the
formulae
of
the
churches
are
unintelligible
without
acquaintance
with
his
conception
of
the
universe
if
we
are
interested
in
the
growth
of
modern
science
we
shall
readily
discover
for
ourselves
that
some
knowledge
of
aristotelianism
is
necessary
for
the
understanding
of
bacon
and
galileo
and
the
other
great
who
created
the
modern
scientific
view
of
nature
if
we
turn
to
the
imaginative
literature
of
the
modern
languages
dante
is
a
sealed
book
and
many
a
passage
of
chaucer
and
shakespeare
and
milton
is
half
unmeaning
to
us
unless
we
are
at
home
in
the
outlines
of
aristotle
s
philosophy
and
if
we
turn
to
ordinary
language
we
find
that
many
of
the
familiar
turns
of
modern
speech
can
not
be
fully
understood
without
a
knowledge
of
the
doctrines
they
were
first
forged
to
express
an
englishman
who
speaks
of
the
golden
mean
or
of
liberal
education
or
contrasts
the
matter
of
a
work
of
literature
with
its
form
or
the
essential
features
of
a
situation
or
a
scheme
of
policy
with
its
accidents
or
theory
with
practice
is
using
words
which
derive
their
significance
from
the
part
they
play
in
the
vocabulary
of
aristotle
the
unambitious
object
of
this
little
book
is
then
to
help
the
english
reader
to
a
better
understanding
of
such
familiar
language
and
a
fuller
comprehension
of
much
that
he
will
find
in
dante
and
shakespeare
and
bacon
of
aristotle
the
main
facts
of
aristotle
s
life
may
be
briefly
told
he
was
born
in
at
stagirus
a
little
city
of
the
chalcidic
peninsula
still
called
almost
by
its
ancient
name
chalcis
and
died
at
the
age
of
at
chalcis
in
euboea
thus
he
is
a
contemporary
of
demosthenes
his
manhood
witnessed
the
struggle
which
ended
in
the
establishment
of
the
macedonian
monarchy
as
the
dominant
power
in
hellas
and
his
later
years
the
campaigns
in
which
his
pupil
alexander
the
great
overthrew
the
persian
empire
and
carried
greek
civilisation
to
the
banks
of
the
jumna
in
studying
the
constitutional
theories
of
aristotle
it
is
necessary
to
bear
these
facts
in
mind
they
help
to
explain
certain
limitations
of
outlook
which
might
otherwise
appear
strange
in
so
great
a
man
it
throws
a
great
deal
of
light
on
the
philosopher
s
intense
conviction
of
the
natural
inferiority
of
the
barbarian
intellect
and
character
to
remember
that
he
grew
up
in
an
outlying
region
where
the
barbarian
was
seen
to
disadvantage
in
the
ordinary
course
of
life
hence
the
distinction
between
greek
and
barbarian
came
to
mean
for
him
much
what
the
does
to
an
american
brought
up
in
a
southern
state
so
again
when
we
are
struck
by
his
provincialism
his
apparent
satisfaction
with
the
ideal
of
a
small
with
a
decently
oligarchical
government
a
good
system
of
public
education
and
no
social
problems
but
devoid
alike
of
great
traditions
and
ambitions
we
must
remember
that
the
philosopher
himself
belonged
to
just
such
a
tiny
community
without
a
past
and
without
a
future
the
chalcidic
cities
had
been
first
founded
as
the
name
of
the
peninsula
implies
as
colonies
from
the
town
of
chalcis
in
euboea
corinth
had
also
been
prominent
in
establishing
settlements
in
the
same
region
at
the
height
of
athenian
imperial
prosperity
in
the
age
of
pericles
the
district
had
fallen
politically
under
athenian
control
but
had
been
detached
again
from
athens
in
the
last
years
of
the
archidamian
war
by
the
genius
of
the
great
spartan
soldier
and
diplomat
brasidas
early
in
the
fourth
century
the
chalcidic
cities
had
attempted
to
form
themselves
into
an
independent
federation
but
the
movement
had
been
put
down
by
sparta
and
the
cities
had
fallen
under
the
control
of
the
rising
macedonian
monarchy
when
aristotle
was
a
baby
a
generation
later
a
double
intrigue
of
the
cities
with
philip
of
macedon
and
athens
failed
of
its
effect
and
the
peninsula
was
finally
incorporated
with
the
macedonian
kingdom
it
is
also
important
to
note
that
the
philosopher
belonged
by
birth
to
a
guild
the
asclepiadae
in
which
the
medical
profession
was
hereditary
his
father
nicomachus
was
court
physician
to
amyntas
the
king
for
whose
benefit
the
spartans
had
put
down
the
chalcidic
league
this
early
connection
with
medicine
and
with
the
macedonian
court
explains
largely
both
the
predominantly
biological
cast
of
aristotle
s
philosophical
thought
and
the
intense
dislike
of
princes
and
courts
to
which
he
more
than
once
gives
expression
at
the
age
of
eighteen
in
aristotle
was
sent
to
athens
for
higher
education
in
philosophy
and
science
and
entered
the
famous
platonic
academy
where
he
remained
as
a
member
of
the
scientific
group
gathered
round
the
master
for
twenty
years
until
plato
s
death
in
for
the
three
years
immediately
following
aristotle
was
in
asia
minor
with
his
friend
and
hermeias
who
had
become
by
force
of
sheer
capacity
monarch
of
the
city
of
atarneus
in
the
troad
and
was
maintaining
himself
with
much
energy
against
the
persian
king
pythias
the
niece
of
hermeias
became
the
philosopher
s
wife
and
it
seems
that
the
marriage
was
happy
examination
of
aristotle
s
contributions
to
marine
biology
has
shown
that
his
knowledge
of
the
subject
is
specially
good
for
the
aeolic
coast
and
the
shores
of
the
adjacent
islands
this
throws
light
on
his
occupations
during
his
residence
with
hermeias
and
suggests
that
plato
had
discerned
the
bent
of
his
distinguished
pupil
s
mind
and
that
his
special
share
in
the
researches
of
the
academy
had
like
that
of
speusippus
plato
s
nephew
and
successor
in
the
headship
of
the
school
been
largely
of
a
biological
kind
we
also
know
that
presumably
shortly
after
plato
s
death
aristotle
had
been
one
of
the
group
of
disciples
who
edited
their
teacher
s
unpublished
lectures
in
hermeias
was
assassinated
at
the
instigation
of
persia
aristotle
honoured
his
memory
by
a
hymn
setting
forth
the
godlikeness
of
virtue
as
illustrated
by
the
life
of
his
friend
aristotle
now
removed
to
the
macedonian
court
where
he
received
the
position
of
tutor
to
the
crown
prince
afterwards
alexander
the
great
at
this
time
a
boy
of
thirteen
the
association
of
the
great
philosopher
and
the
great
king
as
tutor
and
pupil
has
naturally
struck
the
imagination
of
later
ages
even
in
plutarch
s
of
we
meet
already
with
the
legend
of
the
influence
of
aristotle
s
philosophical
speculations
on
alexander
it
is
however
improbable
that
aristotle
s
influence
counted
for
much
in
forming
the
character
of
alexander
aristotle
s
dislike
of
monarchies
and
their
accessories
is
written
large
on
many
a
page
of
his
and
the
small
with
no
political
ambitions
for
which
he
reserves
his
admiration
would
have
seemed
a
mere
relic
of
antiquity
to
philip
and
alexander
the
only
piece
of
contemporary
evidence
as
to
the
relations
between
the
master
and
the
pupil
is
a
sentence
in
a
letter
to
the
young
alexander
from
the
athenian
publicist
isocrates
who
maliciously
congratulates
the
prince
on
his
preference
for
rhetoric
the
art
of
efficient
public
speech
and
his
indifference
to
how
little
sympathy
aristotle
can
have
had
with
his
pupil
s
ambitions
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
though
his
political
theories
must
have
been
worked
out
during
the
very
years
in
which
alexander
was
revolutionising
hellenism
by
the
foundation
of
his
they
contain
no
allusion
to
so
momentous
a
change
in
the
social
order
for
all
that
aristotle
tells
us
alexander
might
never
have
existed
and
the
small
might
have
been
the
last
word
of
hellenic
political
development
hence
it
is
probable
that
the
selection
of
aristotle
who
had
not
yet
appeared
before
the
world
as
an
independent
thinker
to
take
part
in
the
education
of
the
crown
prince
was
due
less
to
personal
reputation
than
to
the
connection
of
his
family
with
the
court
taken
together
with
his
own
position
as
a
pupil
of
plato
whose
intervention
in
the
public
affairs
of
sicily
had
caused
the
academy
to
be
regarded
as
the
special
home
of
scientific
interest
in
politics
and
jurisprudence
it
may
be
true
that
alexander
found
time
in
the
midst
of
his
conquests
to
supply
his
old
tutor
with
zoological
specimens
it
is
as
certain
as
such
a
thing
can
be
that
the
ideals
and
characters
of
the
two
men
were
too
different
to
allow
of
any
intimate
influence
of
either
on
the
other
when
alexander
was
suddenly
called
to
the
macedonian
throne
by
the
murder
of
his
father
in
aristotle
s
services
were
no
longer
needed
he
returned
to
athens
and
gave
himself
to
purely
scientific
work
just
at
this
juncture
the
presidency
of
the
academy
was
vacant
by
the
death
of
speusippus
aristotle
s
old
associate
in
biological
research
possibly
aristotle
thought
himself
injured
when
the
school
passed
him
over
and
elected
xenocrates
of
chalcedon
as
its
new
president
at
any
rate
though
he
appears
never
to
have
wholly
severed
his
connection
with
the
academy
in
he
opened
a
rival
institution
in
the
lyceum
or
gymnasium
attached
to
the
temple
of
apollo
lyceus
to
which
he
was
followed
by
some
of
the
most
distinguished
members
of
the
academy
from
the
fact
that
his
instruction
was
given
in
the
or
covered
portico
of
the
gymnasium
the
school
has
derived
its
name
of
peripatetic
for
the
next
twelve
years
he
was
occupied
in
the
organisation
of
the
school
as
an
abode
for
the
prosecution
of
speculation
and
research
in
every
department
of
inquiry
and
in
the
composition
of
numerous
courses
of
lectures
on
scientific
and
philosophical
questions
the
chief
difference
in
general
character
between
the
new
school
and
the
academy
is
that
while
the
scientific
interests
of
the
platonists
centred
in
mathematics
the
main
contributions
of
the
lyceum
to
science
lay
in
the
departments
of
biology
and
history
towards
the
end
of
alexander
s
life
his
attention
was
unfavourably
directed
on
his
old
teacher
a
relative
of
aristotle
named
callisthenes
had
attended
alexander
in
his
campaigns
as
historiographer
and
had
provoked
disfavour
by
his
censure
of
the
king
s
attempts
to
invest
his
position
towards
his
hellenic
subjects
with
the
pomp
of
an
oriental
despotism
the
historian
s
independence
proved
fatal
he
was
accused
of
instigating
an
assassination
plot
among
alexander
s
pages
and
hanged
or
as
some
said
thrown
into
a
prison
where
he
died
before
trial
alexander
is
reported
to
have
held
aristotle
responsible
for
his
relative
s
treason
and
to
have
meditated
revenge
if
this
is
so
he
was
fortunately
diverted
from
the
commission
of
a
crime
by
preoccupation
with
the
invasion
of
india
on
the
death
of
alexander
in
a
brief
but
vigorous
agitation
broke
out
at
athens
aristotle
from
his
macedonian
connections
naturally
fell
a
victim
in
spite
of
his
want
of
sympathy
with
the
ideals
of
philip
and
alexander
like
socrates
he
was
indicted
on
the
capital
charge
of
impiety
the
pretext
being
that
his
poem
on
the
death
of
hermeias
written
twenty
years
before
was
a
virtual
deification
of
his
friend
this
was
however
only
a
pretext
the
real
offence
was
political
and
lay
in
his
connection
with
the
macedonian
leader
antipater
as
condemnation
was
certain
the
philosopher
anticipated
it
by
withdrawing
with
his
disciples
to
chalcis
the
mother
city
of
his
native
stagirus
here
he
died
in
the
following
year
at
the
age
of
or
the
features
of
aristotle
familiar
to
us
from
busts
and
intaglios
are
handsome
but
indicate
refinement
and
acuteness
rather
than
originality
an
impression
in
keeping
with
what
we
should
expect
from
a
study
of
his
writings
the
anecdotes
related
of
him
reveal
a
kindly
affectionate
character
and
show
little
trace
of
the
which
appears
in
his
work
his
will
which
has
been
preserved
exhibits
the
same
traits
in
its
references
to
his
happy
family
life
and
its
solicitous
care
for
the
future
of
his
children
and
servants
he
was
twice
married
first
to
pythias
and
secondly
to
a
certain
herpyllis
by
whom
he
left
a
son
nicomachus
and
a
daughter
the
goodness
of
herpyllis
to
her
husband
is
specially
mentioned
in
the
clauses
of
the
will
which
make
provision
for
her
while
the
warmth
of
the
writer
s
feelings
for
pythias
is
shown
by
the
direction
that
her
remains
are
to
be
placed
in
the
same
tomb
with
his
own
the
list
of
servants
remembered
and
the
bequests
enumerated
show
the
philosopher
to
have
been
in
easier
circumstances
than
plato
works
of
the
works
of
aristotle
present
us
with
a
curious
problem
when
we
turn
from
plato
to
his
pupil
we
seem
to
have
passed
into
a
different
atmosphere
the
of
exhibit
a
prose
style
which
is
perhaps
the
most
marvellous
of
all
literary
achievements
nowhere
else
do
we
meet
with
quite
the
same
combination
of
eloquence
imaginative
splendour
incisive
logic
and
irresistible
wit
and
humour
the
manner
of
aristotle
is
dry
and
formal
his
language
bristles
with
technicalities
makes
little
appeal
to
the
emotions
disdains
graces
of
style
and
frequently
defies
the
simplest
rules
of
composition
our
surprise
is
all
the
greater
that
we
find
later
writers
of
antiquity
such
as
cicero
commending
aristotle
for
his
copious
and
golden
eloquence
a
characteristic
which
is
conspicuously
wanting
in
the
aristotelian
writings
we
possess
the
explanation
of
the
puzzle
is
however
simple
plato
and
aristotle
were
at
once
what
we
should
call
professors
and
men
of
letters
both
wrote
works
for
general
circulation
and
both
delivered
courses
of
lectures
to
special
students
but
while
plato
s
lectures
have
perished
his
books
have
come
down
to
us
aristotle
s
books
have
almost
wholly
been
lost
but
we
possess
many
of
his
lectures
the
works
of
aristotle
praised
by
cicero
for
their
eloquence
were
philosophical
dialogues
and
formed
the
model
for
cicero
s
own
compositions
in
this
kind
none
of
them
have
survived
though
some
passages
have
been
preserved
in
quotations
by
later
writers
that
the
works
are
actually
the
mss
of
a
lecturer
posthumously
edited
by
his
pupils
seems
clear
from
external
as
well
as
from
internal
evidence
in
one
instance
we
have
the
advantage
of
a
double
recension
aristotle
s
or
on
have
come
down
to
us
in
two
forms
the
a
redaction
by
the
philosopher
s
son
nicomachus
preserving
all
the
characteristics
of
an
oral
course
of
lectures
and
a
freer
and
more
readable
recast
by
a
pupil
the
mathematician
eudemus
known
as
the
in
recent
years
we
have
also
recovered
from
the
sands
of
egypt
what
appears
to
be
our
one
specimen
of
a
work
of
aristotle
intended
to
be
read
by
the
public
at
large
the
essay
on
the
constitution
of
athens
the
style
of
this
essay
is
easy
flowing
and
popular
and
shows
that
aristotle
could
write
well
and
gracefully
when
he
thought
fit
classification
of
the

scientific
philosophy
as
understood
by
aristotle
may
be
said
to
be
the
organised
whole
of
disinterested
knowledge
that
is
knowledge
which
we
seek
for
the
satisfaction
which
it
carries
with
itself
and
not
as
a
mere
means
to
utilitarian
ends
the
impulse
which
receives
this
satisfaction
is
curiosity
or
wonder
which
aristotle
regards
as
innate
in
man
though
it
does
not
get
full
play
until
civilisation
has
advanced
far
enough
to
make
secure
provision
for
the
immediate
material
needs
of
life
human
curiosity
was
naturally
directed
first
to
the
outstanding
marvellous
works
of
the
physical
world
the
planets
the
periodicity
of
their
movements
the
return
of
the
seasons
winds
thunder
and
lightning
and
the
like
hence
the
earliest
greek
speculation
was
concerned
with
problems
of
astronomy
and
meteorology
then
as
reflection
developed
men
speculated
about
geometrical
figure
and
number
the
possibility
of
having
assured
knowledge
at
all
the
character
of
the
common
principles
assumed
in
all
branches
of
study
or
of
the
special
principles
assumed
in
some
one
branch
and
thus
philosophy
has
finally
become
the
disinterested
study
of
every
department
of
being
or
reality
since
aristotle
like
hegel
thought
that
his
own
doctrine
was
in
essentials
the
last
word
of
speculation
the
complete
expression
of
the
principles
by
which
his
predecessors
had
been
unconsciously
guided
he
believes
himself
in
a
position
to
make
a
final
classification
of
the
branches
of
science
showing
how
they
are
related
and
how
they
are
discriminated
from
one
another
this
classification
we
have
now
to
consider
of
the
to
begin
with
we
have
to
discriminate
philosophy
from
two
rivals
with
which
it
might
be
confounded
on
a
superficial
view
dialectic
and
sophistry
dialectic
is
the
art
of
reasoning
accurately
from
given
premisses
true
or
false
this
art
has
its
proper
uses
and
of
one
of
these
we
shall
have
to
speak
but
in
itself
it
is
indifferent
to
the
truth
of
its
premisses
you
may
reason
dialectically
from
premisses
which
you
believe
to
be
false
for
the
express
purpose
of
showing
the
absurd
conclusions
to
which
they
lead
or
you
may
reason
from
premisses
which
you
assume
tentatively
to
see
what
conclusions
you
are
committed
to
if
you
adopt
them
in
either
case
your
object
is
not
directly
to
secure
truth
but
only
to
secure
consistency
science
or
philosophy
aims
directly
at
and
hence
requires
to
start
with
true
and
certain
premisses
thus
the
distinction
between
science
and
dialectic
is
that
science
reasons
from
true
premisses
dialectic
only
from
probable
or
plausible
premisses
sophistry
differs
from
science
in
virtue
of
its
moral
character
it
is
the
profession
of
making
a
living
by
the
abuse
of
reasoning
the
trick
of
employing
logical
skill
for
the
apparent
demonstration
of
scientific
or
ethical
falsehoods
the
sophist
is
one
who
earns
a
living
from
an
apparent
but
unreal
wisdom
the
emphasis
thus
falls
on
the
notion
of
making
an
unreal
wisdom
into
a
the
sophist
s
real
concern
is
to
get
his
fee
science
or
philosophy
is
thus
the
disinterested
employment
of
the
understanding
in
the
discovery
of
truth
we
may
now
distinguish
the
different
branches
of
science
as
defined
the
first
and
most
important
division
to
be
made
is
that
between
speculative
or
theoretical
science
and
practical
science
the
broad
distinction
is
that
which
we
should
now
draw
between
the
sciences
and
the
arts
the
industrial
and
technical
not
the
fine
arts
speculative
or
theoretical
philosophy
differs
from
practical
philosophy
in
its
purpose
and
in
consequence
in
its
and
its
formal
logical
character
the
purpose
of
the
former
is
the
disinterested
contemplation
of
truths
which
are
what
they
are
independently
of
our
own
volition
its
end
is
to
and
only
to
the
object
of
practical
science
is
to
know
but
not
only
to
know
but
also
to
turn
our
knowledge
to
account
in
devising
ways
of
successful
interference
with
the
course
of
events
the
real
importance
of
the
distinction
comes
out
in
aristotle
s
treatment
of
the
problems
of
moral
and
social
science
since
we
require
knowledge
of
the
moral
and
social
nature
of
men
not
merely
to
satisfy
an
intellectual
interest
but
as
a
basis
for
a
sound
system
of
education
and
government
politics
the
theory
of
government
and
ethics
the
theory
of
goodness
of
conduct
which
for
aristotle
is
only
a
subordinate
branch
of
politics
belong
to
practical
not
to
theoretical
philosophy
a
view
which
is
attended
by
important
consequences
it
follows
that
there
is
a
corresponding
difference
in
the
objects
investigated
by
the
two
branches
of
philosophy
speculative
or
theoretical
philosophy
is
concerned
with
that
which
can
not
possibly
be
other
than
it
is
truths
and
relations
independent
of
human
volition
for
their
subsistence
and
calling
simply
for
on
our
part
practical
philosophy
has
to
do
with
relations
which
human
volition
can
modify
things
which
may
be
other
than
they
are
the
contingent
thus
not
only
politics
but
medicine
and
economics
will
belong
to
practical
science
hence
again
arises
a
logical
difference
between
the
conclusions
of
theoretical
and
those
of
practical
philosophy
those
of
the
former
are
universal
truths
deducible
with
logical
necessity
from
principles
those
of
the
latter
because
they
relate
to
what
can
be
otherwise
are
never
rigidly
universal
they
are
rules
which
hold
good
in
the
majority
of
cases
but
are
liable
to
occasional
exceptions
owing
to
the
contingent
character
of
the
facts
with
which
they
deal
it
is
a
proof
of
a
philosopher
s
lack
of
grounding
in
logic
that
he
looks
to
the
results
of
a
practical
science
to
the
detailed
precepts
of
medicine
or
ethics
for
a
higher
degree
of
certainty
and
validity
than
the
nature
of
the
allows
thus
for
aristotle
the
distinction
between
the
necessary
and
the
contingent
is
real
and
not
merely
apparent
and
probability
is
the
guide
in
studies
which
have
to
do
with
the
direction
of
life
that
is
in
a
purely
logical
sense
when
you
apprehend
the
principles
in
question
you
at
once
that
they
are
true
and
do
not
require
to
have
them
it
is
not
meant
that
any
and
every
man
in
point
of
fact
always
apprehend
the
principles
or
that
they
can
be
apprehended
without
preliminary
mental
discipline
we
proceed
to
the
question
how
many
subdivisions
there
are
within
theoretical
philosophy
itself
plato
had
held
that
there
are
none
all
the
sciences
are
deductions
from
a
single
set
of
ultimate
principles
which
it
is
the
business
of
that
supreme
science
to
which
plato
had
given
the
name
of
dialectic
to
establish
this
is
not
aristotle
s
view
according
to
him
theoretical
philosophy
falls
into
a
number
of
distinct
though
not
branches
each
with
its
own
special
subjects
of
investigation
and
its
own
special
axiomatic
principles
of
these
branches
there
are
three
first
philosophy
mathematics
and
physics
first
philosophy
afterwards
to
be
known
to
the
middle
ages
as
metaphysics
treats
to
use
aristotle
s
own
expression
of
being
being
this
means
that
it
is
concerned
with
the
universal
characteristics
which
belong
to
the
system
of
knowable
reality
as
such
and
the
principles
of
its
organisation
in
their
full
universality
first
philosophy
alone
investigates
the
character
of
those
causative
factors
in
the
system
which
are
without
body
or
shape
and
exempt
from
all
mutability
since
in
aristotle
s
system
god
is
the
supreme
cause
of
this
kind
first
philosophy
culminates
in
the
knowledge
of
god
and
is
hence
frequently
called
theology
it
thus
includes
an
element
which
would
be
assigned
to
the
theory
of
knowledge
as
well
as
one
which
we
should
ascribe
to
metaphysics
since
it
deals
at
once
with
the
ultimate
postulates
of
knowledge
and
the
ultimate
causes
of
the
order
of
real
existence
the
origin
of
this
name
seems
to
be
that
aristotle
s
lectures
on
first
philosophy
came
to
be
studied
as
a
continuation
of
his
course
on
physics
hence
the
lectures
got
the
name
because
they
came
those
on
physics
finally
the
name
was
transferred
as
in
the
case
of
from
the
lectures
to
the
subject
of
which
they
treat
mathematics
is
of
narrower
scope
what
it
studies
is
no
longer
real
being
as
such
but
only
real
being
in
so
far
as
it
exhibits
number
and
geometrical
form
since
aristotle
holds
the
view
that
number
and
figure
only
exist
as
determinations
of
objects
given
in
perception
though
by
a
convenient
fiction
the
mathematician
treats
of
them
in
abstraction
from
the
perceived
objects
which
they
qualify
he
marks
the
difference
between
mathematics
and
first
philosophy
by
saying
that
whereas
the
objects
of
first
philosophy
are
separate
from
matter
and
devoid
of
motion
those
of
mathematics
though
incapable
of
motion
have
no
separable
existence
but
are
inherent
in
matter
physics
is
concerned
with
the
study
of
objects
which
are
both
material
and
capable
of
motion
thus
the
principle
of
the
distinction
is
the
presence
or
absence
of
initial
restrictions
of
the
range
of
the
different
branches
of
science
first
philosophy
has
the
widest
range
since
its
contemplation
covers
the
whole
ground
of
the
real
and
knowable
physics
the
narrowest
because
it
is
confined
to
a
universe
of
discourse
restricted
by
the
double
qualification
that
its
members
are
all
material
and
capable
of
displacement
mathematics
holds
an
intermediate
position
since
in
it
one
of
these
qualifications
is
removed
but
the
other
still
remains
for
the
geometer
s
figures
are
boundaries
and
limits
of
sensible
bodies
and
the
arithmetician
s
numbers
properties
of
collections
of
concrete
objects
it
follows
also
that
the
initial
axioms
or
postulates
of
mathematics
form
a
less
simple
system
than
those
of
first
philosophy
and
those
of
physics
than
those
of
mathematics
mathematics
requires
as
initial
assumptions
not
only
those
which
hold
good
for
thought
but
certain
other
special
axioms
which
are
only
valid
and
significant
for
the
realm
of
figure
and
number
physics
requires
yet
further
axioms
which
are
only
applicable
to
what
is
in
motion
this
is
why
though
the
three
disciplines
are
treated
as
distinct
they
are
not
strictly
and
first
philosophy
though
first
is
only
inter
we
thus
get
the
following
diagrammatic
scheme
of
the
classification
of
sciences
science
theoretical
practical
first
philosophy
physics
or
matics
theology
practical
philosophy
is
not
subjected
by
aristotle
to
any
similar
subdivision
later
students
were
accustomed
to
recognise
a
threefold
division
into
ethics
the
theory
of
individual
conduct
economics
the
theory
of
the
management
of
the
household
politics
the
theory
of
the
management
of
the
state
aristotle
himself
does
not
make
these
distinctions
his
general
name
for
the
theory
of
conduct
is
politics
the
doctrine
of
individual
conduct
being
for
him
inseparable
from
that
of
the
right
ordering
of
society
though
he
composed
a
separate
course
of
lectures
on
individual
conduct
the
he
takes
care
to
open
the
course
by
stating
that
the
science
of
which
it
treats
is
politics
and
offers
an
apology
for
dealing
with
the
education
of
individual
character
apart
from
the
more
general
doctrine
of
the
organisation
of
society
no
special
recognition
is
given
in
aristotle
s
own
classification
to
the
philosophy
of
art
modern
students
of
aristotle
have
tried
to
fill
in
the
omission
by
adding
artistic
creation
to
contemplation
and
practice
as
a
third
fundamental
form
of
mental
activity
and
thus
making
a
threefold
division
of
philosophy
into
theoretical
practical
and
productive
the
object
of
this
is
to
find
a
place
in
the
classification
for
aristotle
s
famous
and
his
work
on
rhetoric
the
art
of
effective
speech
and
writing
but
the
admission
of
the
third
division
of
science
has
no
warrant
in
the
text
of
aristotle
nor
are
the
and
properly
speaking
a
contribution
to
philosophy
they
are
intended
as
collections
of
practical
rules
for
the
composition
of
a
pamphlet
or
a
tragedy
not
as
a
critical
examination
of
the
canons
of
literary
taste
this
was
correctly
seen
by
the
dramatic
theorists
of
the
seventeenth
century
they
exaggerated
the
value
of
aristotle
s
directions
and
entirely
misunderstood
the
meaning
of
some
of
them
but
they
were
right
in
their
view
that
the
was
meant
to
be
a
collection
of
rules
by
obeying
which
the
craftsman
might
make
sure
of
turning
out
a
successful
play
so
far
as
aristotle
has
a
philosophy
of
fine
art
at
all
it
forms
part
of
his
more
general
theory
of
education
and
must
be
looked
for
in
the
general
discussion
of
the
aims
of
education
contained
in
his
methods
of
no
place
has
been
assigned
in
the
scheme
to
what
we
call
logic
and
aristotle
called
the
theory
of
scientific
method
or
of
proof
and
the
estimation
of
evidence
the
reason
is
that
since
the
fundamental
character
of
proof
is
the
same
in
all
science
aristotle
looks
upon
logic
as
a
study
of
the
methods
common
to
all
science
at
a
later
date
it
became
a
hotly
debated
question
whether
logic
should
be
regarded
in
this
way
as
a
study
of
the
methods
instrumental
to
proof
in
all
sciences
or
as
itself
a
special
constituent
division
of
philosophy
the
aristotelian
view
was
concisely
indicated
by
the
name
which
became
attached
to
the
collection
of
aristotle
s
logical
works
they
were
called
the
that
is
the
instrument
or
the
body
of
rules
of
method
employed
by
science
the
thought
implied
is
thus
that
logic
furnishes
the
with
which
every
science
has
to
work
in
establishing
its
results
our
space
will
only
permit
of
a
brief
statement
as
to
the
points
in
which
the
aristotelian
formal
logic
appears
to
be
really
original
and
the
main
peculiarities
of
aristotle
s
theory
of
knowledge
a
in
compass
the
aristotelian
logic
corresponds
roughly
with
the
contents
of
modern
elementary
treatises
on
the
same
subject
with
the
omission
of
the
sections
which
deal
with
the
conditional
syllogism
the
inclusion
of
arguments
of
this
type
in
mediæval
and
modern
expositions
of
formal
logic
is
principally
due
to
the
stoics
who
preferred
to
throw
their
reasoning
into
these
forms
and
subjected
them
to
minute
scrutiny
in
his
treatment
of
the
doctrine
of
terms
aristotle
avoids
the
mistake
of
treating
the
isolated
name
as
though
it
had
significance
apart
from
the
enunciations
in
which
it
occurs
he
is
quite
clear
on
the
point
that
the
unit
of
thought
is
the
proposition
in
which
something
is
affirmed
or
denied
the
one
which
can
be
properly
called
true
or
false
such
an
assertion
he
analyses
into
two
factors
that
about
which
something
is
affirmed
or
denied
the
subject
and
that
which
is
affirmed
or
denied
of
it
the
predicate
consequently
his
doctrine
of
the
classification
of
terms
is
based
on
a
classification
of
predicates
or
of
propositions
according
to
the
special
kind
of
connection
between
the
subject
and
predicate
which
they
affirm
or
deny
two
such
classifications
which
can
not
be
made
to
fit
into
one
another
meet
us
in
aristotle
s
logical
writings
the
scheme
of
the
ten
categories
and
that
which
was
afterwards
known
in
the
middle
ages
as
the
list
of
predicaments
or
heads
of
predicates
or
again
as
the
five
words
the
list
of
categories
reveals
itself
as
an
attempt
to
answer
the
question
in
how
many
different
senses
the
words
is
a
or
are
are
employed
when
we
assert
that
is
or
is
a
or
are
such
a
statement
may
tell
us
what
is
as
if
i
say
is
a
lion
the
predicate
is
then
said
to
fall
under
the
category
of
substance
what
is
like
as
when
i
say
is
white
or
is
wise
the
category
of
quality
how
much
or
how
many
is
as
when
i
say
is
tall
or
is
five
feet
long
the
category
of
quantity
how
is
related
to
something
else
as
when
i
say
is
to
the
right
of
is
the
father
of
the
category
of
relation
these
are
the
four
chief
categories
discussed
by
aristotle
the
remainder
are
place
time
and
condition
or
state
as
when
i
say
is
sitting
down
or
has
his
armour
on
the
only
distinction
between
the
two
cases
seems
to
be
that
denotes
a
more
permanent
state
of
than
action
or
activity
as
when
i
say
is
cutting
or
generally
is
doing
something
to
passivity
as
when
i
say
is
being
cut
or
more
generally
is
being
done
to
no
attempt
is
made
to
show
that
this
list
of
figures
of
predication
is
complete
or
to
point
out
any
principle
which
has
been
followed
in
its
construction
it
also
happens
that
much
the
same
enumeration
is
incidentally
made
in
one
or
two
passages
of
plato
hence
it
is
not
unlikely
that
the
list
was
taken
over
by
aristotle
as
one
which
would
be
familiar
to
pupils
who
had
read
their
plato
and
therefore
convenient
for
practical
purposes
the
fivefold
classification
does
depend
on
a
principle
pointed
out
by
aristotle
which
guarantees
its
completeness
and
is
therefore
likely
to
have
been
thought
out
by
him
for
himself
and
to
be
the
genuine
aristotelian
scheme
consider
an
ordinary
universal
affirmative
proposition
of
the
form
all
are
now
if
this
statement
is
true
it
may
also
be
true
that
all
are
or
it
may
not
on
the
first
supposition
we
have
two
possible
cases
the
predicate
may
state
precisely
what
the
subject
defined
then
is
the
definition
of
as
when
i
say
that
men
are
mortal
animals
capable
of
discourse
here
it
is
also
true
to
say
that
mortal
animals
capable
of
discourse
are
men
and
aristotle
regards
the
predicate
mortal
animal
capable
of
discourse
as
expressing
the
inmost
nature
of
man
the
predicate
may
not
express
the
inmost
nature
of
the
subject
and
yet
may
belong
only
to
the
class
denoted
by
the
subject
and
to
every
member
of
that
class
the
predicate
is
then
called
a
proprium
or
property
an
exclusive
attribute
of
the
class
in
question
thus
it
was
held
that
all
men
are
capable
of
laughter
and
all
beings
capable
of
laughter
are
men
but
that
the
capacity
for
laughter
is
no
part
of
the
inmost
nature
or
real
essence
of
humanity
it
is
therefore
reckoned
as
a
proprium
again
in
the
case
where
it
is
true
that
all
are
but
not
true
that
all
are
may
be
part
of
the
definition
of
or
it
may
not
if
it
is
part
of
the
definition
of
it
will
be
either
a
genus
or
wider
class
of
which
forms
a
subdivision
as
when
i
say
all
men
are
animals
or
a
difference
that
is
one
of
the
distinctive
marks
by
which
the
are
distinguished
from
other
or
species
of
the
same
genus
as
when
i
say
all
men
are
capable
of
discourse
or
finally
may
be
no
part
of
the
definition
of
but
a
characteristic
which
belongs
both
to
the
and
some
things
other
than
the
predicate
is
then
called
an
accident
we
have
now
exhausted
all
the
possible
cases
and
may
say
that
the
predicate
of
a
universal
affirmative
proposition
is
always
either
a
definition
a
proprium
a
genus
a
difference
or
an
accident
this
classification
reached
the
middle
ages
not
in
the
precise
form
in
which
it
is
given
by
aristotle
but
with
modifications
mainly
due
to
the
philosopher
porphyry
in
its
modified
form
it
is
regarded
as
a
classification
of
terms
generally
definition
disappears
from
the
list
as
the
definition
is
regarded
as
a
complex
made
up
of
the
genus
or
next
highest
class
to
which
the
class
to
be
defined
belongs
and
the
differences
which
mark
off
this
particular
species
or
the
species
itself
which
figures
as
the
in
a
definition
is
added
and
thus
the
five
words
of
mediæval
logic
are
enumerated
as
genus
species
difference
proprium
accident
the
one
point
of
philosophical
interest
about
this
doctrine
appears
alike
in
the
scheme
of
the
categories
in
the
presence
of
a
category
of
substance
and
in
the
list
of
predicaments
in
the
sharp
distinction
drawn
between
definition
and
proprium
from
a
logical
point
of
view
it
does
not
appear
why
proprium
character
belonging
to
all
the
members
of
a
class
and
to
them
alone
should
not
be
taken
as
defining
the
class
why
should
it
be
assumed
that
there
is
only
predicate
viz
which
precisely
answers
the
question
what
is
socrates
why
should
it
not
be
equally
correct
to
answer
a
greek
or
a
philosopher
the
explanation
is
that
aristotle
takes
it
for
granted
that
not
all
the
distinctions
we
can
make
between
kinds
of
things
are
arbitrary
and
subjective
nature
herself
has
made
certain
hard
and
fast
divisions
between
kinds
which
it
is
the
business
of
our
thought
to
recognise
and
follow
thus
according
to
aristotle
there
is
a
real
gulf
a
genuine
difference
in
kind
between
the
horse
and
the
ass
and
this
is
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
the
mule
the
offspring
of
a
horse
and
an
ass
is
not
capable
of
reproduction
it
is
thus
a
sort
of
imperfect
being
a
kind
of
monster
existing
such
differences
as
we
find
when
we
compare
egyptians
with
greeks
do
not
amount
to
a
difference
in
kind
to
say
that
socrates
is
a
man
tells
me
what
socrates
is
because
the
statement
places
socrates
in
the
real
kind
to
which
he
actually
belongs
to
say
that
he
is
wise
or
old
or
a
philosopher
merely
tells
me
some
of
his
attributes
it
follows
from
this
belief
in
real
or
natural
kinds
that
the
problem
of
definition
acquires
an
enormous
importance
for
science
we
who
are
accustomed
to
regard
the
whole
business
of
classification
as
a
matter
of
making
a
grouping
of
our
materials
such
as
is
most
pertinent
to
the
special
question
we
have
in
hand
tend
to
look
upon
any
predicate
which
belongs
universally
and
exclusively
to
the
members
of
a
group
as
a
sufficient
basis
for
a
possible
definition
of
the
group
hence
we
are
prone
to
take
the
nominalist
view
of
definition
to
look
upon
a
definition
as
no
more
than
a
declaration
of
the
sense
which
we
intend
henceforward
to
put
on
a
word
or
other
symbol
and
consequently
we
readily
admit
that
there
may
be
as
many
definitions
of
a
class
as
it
has
different
propria
but
in
a
philosophy
like
that
of
aristotle
in
which
it
is
held
that
a
true
classification
must
not
only
be
formally
satisfactory
but
must
also
conform
to
the
actual
lines
of
cleavage
which
nature
has
established
between
kind
and
kind
the
task
of
classificatory
science
becomes
much
more
difficult
science
is
called
on
to
supply
not
merely
a
definition
but
definition
of
the
classes
it
considers
definition
which
faithfully
reflects
the
lines
of
cleavage
in
nature
this
is
why
the
aristotelian
view
is
that
a
true
definition
should
always
be
genus
et
it
should
place
a
given
class
by
mentioning
the
wider
class
next
above
it
in
the
objective
hierarchy
and
then
enumerating
the
most
distinctions
by
which
nature
herself
marks
off
this
class
from
others
belonging
to
the
same
wider
class
modern
evolutionary
thought
may
possibly
bring
us
back
to
this
aristotelian
standpoint
modern
evolutionary
science
differs
from
aristotelianism
on
one
point
of
the
first
importance
it
regards
the
difference
between
kinds
not
as
a
primary
fact
of
nature
but
as
produced
by
a
long
process
of
accumulation
of
slight
differences
but
a
world
in
which
the
process
has
progressed
far
enough
will
exhibit
much
the
same
character
as
the
nature
of
aristotle
as
the
intermediate
links
between
species
drop
out
because
they
are
less
thoroughly
adapted
to
maintain
themselves
than
the
extremes
between
which
they
form
links
the
world
produced
approximates
more
and
more
to
a
system
of
species
between
which
there
are
unbridgeable
chasms
evolution
tends
more
and
more
to
the
final
establishment
of
real
kinds
marked
by
the
fact
that
there
is
no
permanent
possibility
of
between
them
this
makes
it
once
more
possible
to
distinguish
between
a
nominal
definition
and
a
real
definition
from
an
evolutionary
point
of
view
a
real
definition
would
be
one
which
specifies
not
merely
enough
characters
to
mark
off
the
group
defined
from
others
but
selects
also
for
the
purpose
those
characters
which
indicate
the
line
of
historical
development
by
which
the
group
has
successively
separated
itself
from
other
groups
descended
from
the
same
ancestors
we
shall
learn
yet
more
of
the
significance
of
this
conception
of
a
real
kind
as
we
go
on
to
make
acquaintance
with
the
outlines
of
first
philosophy
over
the
rest
of
the
formal
logic
of
aristotle
we
must
be
content
to
pass
more
rapidly
in
connection
with
the
doctrine
of
propositions
aristotle
lays
down
the
familiar
distinction
between
the
four
types
of
proposition
according
to
their
quantity
as
universal
or
particular
and
quality
as
affirmative
or
negative
and
treats
of
their
contrary
and
contradictory
opposition
in
a
way
which
still
forms
the
basis
of
the
handling
of
the
subject
in
elementary
works
on
formal
logic
he
also
considers
at
great
length
a
subject
nowadays
commonly
excluded
from
the
elementary
books
the
modal
distinction
between
the
problematic
proposition
may
be
the
assertory
is
and
the
necessary
must
be
and
the
way
in
which
all
these
forms
may
be
contradicted
for
him
modality
is
a
formal
distinction
like
quantity
or
quality
because
he
believes
that
contingency
and
necessity
are
not
merely
relative
to
the
state
of
our
knowledge
but
represent
real
and
objective
features
of
the
order
of
nature
in
connection
with
the
doctrine
of
inference
it
is
worth
while
to
give
his
definition
of
syllogism
or
inference
literally
computation
in
his
own
words
syllogism
is
a
discourse
wherein
certain
things
viz
the
premisses
being
admitted
something
else
different
from
what
has
been
admitted
follows
of
necessity
because
the
admissions
are
what
they
are
the
last
clause
shows
that
aristotle
is
aware
that
the
thing
in
an
inference
is
not
that
the
conclusion
should
be
novel
but
that
it
should
be
proved
we
may
have
known
the
conclusion
as
a
fact
before
what
the
inference
does
for
us
is
to
connect
it
with
the
rest
of
our
knowledge
and
thus
to
show
it
is
true
he
also
formulates
the
axiom
upon
which
syllogistic
inference
rests
that
if
a
is
predicated
universally
of
b
and
b
of
c
a
is
necessarily
predicated
universally
of
stated
in
the
language
of
and
adapted
to
include
the
case
where
b
is
denied
of
c
this
becomes
the
formula
whatever
is
asserted
universally
whether
positively
or
negatively
of
a
class
b
is
asserted
in
like
manner
of
any
class
c
which
is
wholly
contained
in
b
the
axiom
omni
et
of
mediæval
logic
the
syllogism
of
the
first
figure
to
which
this
principle
immediately
applies
is
accordingly
regarded
by
aristotle
as
the
natural
and
perfect
form
of
inference
syllogisms
of
the
second
and
third
figures
can
only
be
shown
to
fall
under
the
dictum
by
a
process
of
reduction
or
transformation
into
corresponding
arguments
in
the
first
figure
and
are
therefore
called
imperfect
or
incomplete
because
they
do
not
exhibit
the
conclusive
force
of
the
reasoning
with
equal
clearness
and
also
because
no
universal
affirmative
conclusion
can
be
proved
in
them
and
the
aim
of
science
is
always
to
establish
such
affirmatives
the
list
of
moods
of
the
three
figures
and
the
doctrine
of
the
methods
by
which
each
mood
of
the
imperfect
figures
can
be
replaced
by
an
equivalent
mood
of
the
first
is
worked
out
substantially
as
in
our
current
the
fourth
figure
is
not
recognised
its
moods
being
regarded
merely
as
unnatural
and
distorted
statements
of
those
of
the
first
figure
of
the
use
of
induction
in
aristotle
s
philosophy
we
shall
speak
under
the
head
of
theory
of
knowledge
formally
it
is
called
the
way
of
proceeding
from
particular
facts
to
universals
and
aristotle
insists
that
the
conclusion
is
only
proved
if
the
particulars
have
been
examined
thus
he
gives
as
an
example
the
following
argument
are
species
of
animals
are
the
only
species
which
have
no
gall
all
animals
which
have
no
gall
are
this
is
the
induction
by
simple
enumeration
denounced
by
francis
bacon
on
the
ground
that
it
may
always
be
discredited
by
the
production
of
a
single
contrary
instance
a
single
instance
of
an
animal
which
has
no
gall
and
yet
is
not
aristotle
is
quite
aware
that
his
induction
does
not
establish
its
conclusion
unless
all
the
cases
have
been
included
in
the
examination
in
fact
as
his
own
example
shows
an
induction
which
gives
certainty
does
not
start
with
particular
facts
at
all
it
is
a
method
of
arguing
that
what
has
been
proved
true
of
each
of
a
wider
class
will
be
true
of
the
wider
class
as
a
whole
the
premisses
are
strictly
universal
throughout
in
general
aristotle
does
not
regard
induction
as
at
all
historically
induction
is
held
by
aristotle
to
have
been
first
made
prominent
in
philosophy
by
socrates
who
constantly
employed
the
method
in
his
attempts
to
establish
universal
results
in
moral
science
thus
he
gives
as
a
characteristic
argument
for
the
famous
socratic
doctrine
that
knowledge
is
the
one
thing
needful
the
induction
he
who
understands
the
theory
of
navigation
is
the
best
navigator
he
who
understands
the
theory
of
the
best
driver
from
these
examples
we
see
that
universally
he
who
understands
the
theory
of
a
thing
is
the
best
practitioner
where
it
is
evident
that
the
relevant
cases
have
been
examined
and
consequently
that
the
reasoning
does
not
amount
to
proof
mill
s
reasoning
from
particulars
to
particulars
finds
a
place
in
aristotle
s
theory
under
the
name
of
arguing
from
an
example
he
gives
as
an
illustration
a
war
between
athens
and
thebes
will
be
a
bad
thing
for
we
see
that
the
war
between
thebes
and
phocis
was
so
he
is
careful
to
point
out
that
the
whole
force
of
the
argument
depends
on
the
assumption
of
a
universal
proposition
which
covers
both
cases
such
as
wars
between
are
bad
things
hence
he
calls
such
appeals
to
example
rhetorical
reasoning
because
the
politician
is
accustomed
to
leave
his
hearers
to
supply
the
relevant
universal
consideration
for
themselves
of
here
as
everywhere
in
aristotle
s
philosophy
we
are
confronted
by
an
initial
and
insuperable
difficulty
aristotle
is
always
anxious
to
insist
on
the
difference
between
his
own
doctrines
and
those
of
plato
and
his
bias
in
this
direction
regularly
leads
him
to
speak
as
though
he
held
a
naturalistic
and
empirical
theory
with
no
transcendental
moonshine
about
it
yet
his
final
conclusions
on
all
points
of
importance
are
hardly
distinguishable
from
those
of
plato
except
by
the
fact
that
as
they
are
so
much
at
variance
with
the
naturalistic
side
of
his
philosophy
they
have
the
appearance
of
being
sudden
lapses
into
an
alogical
mysticism
we
shall
find
the
presence
of
this
fault
more
pronouncedly
in
his
metaphysics
psychology
and
ethics
than
in
his
theory
of
knowledge
but
it
is
not
absent
from
any
part
of
his
philosophy
he
is
everywhere
a
platonist
and
it
is
just
the
platonic
element
in
his
thought
to
which
it
owes
its
hold
over
men
s
minds
plato
s
doctrine
on
the
subject
may
be
stated
with
enough
accuracy
for
our
purpose
as
follows
there
is
a
radical
distinction
between
and
scientific
knowledge
a
scientific
truth
is
exact
and
definite
it
is
also
true
once
and
for
all
and
never
becomes
truer
or
falser
with
the
lapse
of
time
this
is
the
character
of
the
propositions
of
the
science
which
plato
regarded
as
the
type
of
what
true
science
ought
to
be
pure
mathematics
it
is
very
different
with
the
judgments
which
we
try
to
base
on
our
of
the
visible
and
tangible
world
the
colours
tastes
shapes
of
sensible
things
seem
different
to
different
percipients
and
moreover
they
are
constantly
changing
in
incalculable
ways
we
can
never
be
certain
that
two
lines
which
seem
to
our
senses
to
be
equal
are
really
so
it
may
be
that
the
inequality
is
merely
too
slight
to
be
perceptible
to
our
senses
no
figure
which
we
can
draw
and
see
actually
has
the
exact
properties
ascribed
by
the
mathematician
to
a
circle
or
a
square
hence
plato
concludes
that
if
the
word
science
be
taken
in
its
fullest
sense
there
can
be
no
science
about
the
world
which
our
senses
reveal
we
can
have
only
an
approximate
knowledge
a
knowledge
which
is
after
all
at
best
probable
opinion
the
objects
of
which
the
mathematician
has
certain
exact
and
final
knowledge
can
not
be
anything
which
the
senses
reveal
they
are
objects
of
and
the
function
of
visible
models
and
diagrams
in
mathematics
is
not
to
present
of
them
to
us
but
only
to
show
us
imperfect
to
them
and
so
to
remind
the
soul
of
objects
and
relations
between
them
which
she
has
never
cognised
with
the
bodily
senses
thus
mathematical
straightness
is
never
actually
beheld
but
when
we
see
lines
of
less
and
more
approximate
straightness
we
are
put
in
mind
of
that
absolute
straightness
to
which
only
approximates
so
in
the
moral
sciences
the
various
virtues
are
not
presented
in
their
perfection
by
the
course
of
daily
life
we
do
not
meet
with
men
who
are
perfectly
brave
or
just
but
the
experience
that
one
man
is
braver
or
juster
than
another
calls
into
our
mind
the
thought
of
the
absolute
standard
of
courage
or
justice
implied
in
the
conviction
that
one
man
comes
nearer
to
it
than
another
and
it
is
these
absolute
standards
which
are
the
real
objects
of
our
attention
when
we
try
to
define
the
terms
by
which
we
describe
the
moral
life
this
is
the
epistemological
side
of
the
famous
doctrine
of
the
ideas
the
main
points
are
two
that
strict
science
deals
throughout
with
objects
and
relations
between
objects
which
are
of
a
purely
intellectual
or
conceptual
order
no
entering
into
their
constitution
since
the
objects
of
science
are
of
this
character
it
follows
that
the
idea
or
concept
or
universal
is
not
arrived
at
by
any
process
of
abstracting
from
our
experience
of
sensible
things
the
features
common
to
them
all
as
the
particular
fact
never
actually
exhibits
the
universal
except
approximately
the
universal
can
not
be
simply
disentangled
from
particulars
by
abstraction
as
plato
puts
it
it
is
apart
from
particulars
or
as
we
might
reword
his
thought
the
pure
concepts
of
science
represent
upper
limits
to
which
the
comparative
series
which
we
can
form
out
of
sensible
data
continually
approximate
but
do
not
reach
them
in
his
theory
of
knowledge
aristotle
begins
by
brushing
aside
the
platonic
view
science
requires
no
such
ideas
transcending
as
plato
had
spoken
of
they
are
in
fact
no
more
than
poetic
metaphors
what
is
required
for
science
is
not
that
there
should
be
a
one
over
and
above
the
many
that
is
such
pure
concepts
unrealised
in
the
world
of
actual
perception
as
plato
had
spoken
of
but
only
that
it
should
be
possible
to
predicate
one
term
universally
of
many
others
this
by
itself
means
that
the
universal
is
looked
on
as
a
mere
residue
of
the
characteristics
found
in
each
member
of
a
group
got
by
abstraction
by
leaving
out
of
view
the
characteristics
which
are
peculiar
to
some
of
the
group
and
retaining
only
those
which
are
common
to
all
if
aristotle
had
held
consistently
to
this
point
of
view
his
theory
of
knowledge
would
have
been
a
purely
empirical
one
he
would
have
had
to
say
that
since
all
the
objects
of
knowledge
are
particular
facts
given
in
the
universal
laws
of
science
are
a
mere
convenient
way
of
describing
the
observed
uniformities
in
the
behaviour
of
sensible
things
but
since
it
is
obvious
that
in
pure
mathematics
we
are
not
concerned
with
the
actual
relations
between
sensible
data
or
the
actual
ways
in
which
they
behave
but
with
pure
cases
or
ideals
to
which
the
perceived
world
only
approximately
conforms
he
would
also
have
had
to
say
that
the
propositions
of
mathematics
are
not
strictly
true
in
modern
times
consistent
empiricists
have
said
this
but
it
is
not
a
position
possible
to
one
who
had
passed
twenty
years
in
association
with
the
mathematicians
of
the
academy
and
aristotle
s
theory
only
begins
in
naturalism
to
end
in
platonism
we
may
condense
its
most
striking
positions
into
the
following
statement
by
science
we
mean
knowledge
and
proved
knowledge
is
always
mediated
it
is
the
knowledge
of
from
premisses
a
truth
that
is
scientifically
known
does
not
stand
alone
the
proof
is
simply
the
pointing
out
of
the
connection
between
the
truth
we
call
the
conclusion
and
other
truths
which
we
call
the
premisses
of
our
demonstration
science
points
out
the
of
things
and
this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
aristotelian
principle
that
to
have
science
is
to
know
things
through
their
or
in
an
ordered
digest
of
scientific
truths
the
proper
arrangement
is
to
begin
with
the
simplest
and
most
widely
extended
principles
and
to
reason
down
through
successive
inferences
to
the
most
complex
propositions
the
of
which
can
only
be
exhibited
by
long
chains
of
deductions
this
is
the
order
of
logical
dependence
and
is
described
by
aristotle
as
reasoning
what
is
more
knowable
in
its
own
nature
the
simple
to
what
is
usually
more
familiar
to
because
less
removed
from
the
infinite
wealth
of
the
complex
in
we
have
usually
to
reverse
the
process
and
argue
from
the
familiar
to
us
highly
complex
facts
to
the
more
knowable
in
its
own
nature
the
simpler
principles
implied
in
the
facts
this
simple
expression
acquires
a
mysterious
appearance
in
mediæval
philosophy
from
the
standing
mistranslation
better
known
to
nature
it
follows
that
aristotle
after
all
admits
the
disparateness
of
and
scientific
knowledge
of
itself
never
gives
us
scientific
truth
because
it
can
only
assure
us
that
a
fact
is
so
it
can
not
the
fact
by
showing
its
connection
with
the
rest
of
the
system
of
facts
it
does
not
give
the
for
the
fact
knowledge
of
perception
is
always
immediate
and
for
that
very
reason
is
never
scientific
if
we
stood
on
the
moon
and
saw
the
earth
interposing
between
us
and
the
sun
we
should
still
not
have
scientific
knowledge
about
the
eclipse
because
we
should
still
have
to
ask
for
the
in
fact
we
should
not
know
the
reason
without
a
theory
of
light
including
the
proposition
that
are
propagated
in
straight
lines
and
several
others
similarly
aristotle
insists
that
induction
does
not
yield
scientific
truth
he
who
makes
an
induction
points
out
something
but
does
not
demonstrate
anything
for
instance
if
we
know
that
species
of
animal
which
is
without
a
gall
is
we
may
make
the
induction
that
animals
without
a
gall
are
but
in
doing
so
we
have
got
no
nearer
to
seeing
or
the
absence
of
a
gall
makes
for
longevity
the
question
which
we
may
raise
in
science
may
all
be
reduced
to
four
heads
does
this
thing
exist
does
this
event
occur
if
the
thing
exists
precisely
what
is
it
and
if
the
event
occurs
does
it
occur
and
science
has
not
completed
its
task
unless
it
can
advance
from
the
solution
of
the
first
two
questions
to
that
of
the
latter
two
science
is
no
mere
catalogue
of
things
and
events
it
consists
of
inquiries
into
the
real
essences
and
characteristics
of
things
and
the
laws
of
connection
between
events
looking
at
scientific
reasoning
then
from
the
point
of
view
of
its
formal
character
we
may
say
that
all
science
consists
in
the
search
for
middle
terms
of
syllogisms
by
which
to
connect
the
truth
which
appears
as
a
conclusion
with
the
less
complex
truths
which
appear
as
the
premisses
from
which
it
is
drawn
when
we
ask
does
such
a
thing
exist
or
does
such
an
event
happen
we
are
asking
is
there
a
middle
term
which
can
connect
the
thing
or
event
in
question
with
the
rest
of
known
reality
since
it
is
a
rule
of
the
syllogism
that
the
middle
term
must
be
taken
universally
at
least
once
in
the
premisses
the
search
for
middle
terms
may
also
be
described
as
the
search
for
universals
and
we
may
speak
of
science
as
knowledge
of
the
universal
interconnections
between
facts
and
events
a
science
then
may
be
analysed
into
three
constituents
these
are
a
determinate
class
of
objects
which
form
the
of
its
inquiries
in
an
orderly
exhibition
of
the
contents
of
the
science
these
appear
as
in
euclid
as
the
initial
data
about
which
the
science
reasons
a
number
of
principles
postulates
and
axioms
from
which
our
demonstrations
must
start
some
of
these
will
be
principles
employed
in
all
scientific
reasoning
others
will
be
specific
to
the
with
which
a
particular
science
is
concerned
certain
characteristics
of
the
objects
under
study
which
can
be
shown
by
means
of
our
axioms
and
postulates
to
follow
from
our
initial
definitions
the
per
of
the
objects
defined
it
is
these
last
which
are
expressed
by
the
conclusions
of
scientific
demonstration
we
are
said
to
know
scientifically
that
b
is
true
of
a
when
we
show
that
this
follows
in
virtue
of
the
principles
of
some
science
from
the
initial
definition
of
a
thus
if
we
convinced
ourselves
that
the
sum
of
the
angles
of
a
plane
triangle
is
equal
to
two
right
angles
by
measurement
we
could
not
be
said
to
have
scientific
knowledge
of
the
proposition
but
if
we
show
that
the
same
proposition
follows
from
the
definition
of
a
plane
triangle
by
repeated
applications
of
admitted
axioms
or
postulates
of
geometry
our
knowledge
is
genuinely
scientific
we
now
know
that
it
is
so
and
we
see
it
is
so
we
see
the
connection
of
this
truth
with
the
simple
initial
truths
of
geometry
this
leads
us
to
the
consideration
of
the
most
characteristic
point
of
aristotle
s
whole
theory
science
is
demonstrated
knowledge
that
is
it
is
the
knowledge
that
certain
truths
follow
from
still
simpler
truths
hence
the
simplest
of
all
the
truths
of
any
science
can
not
themselves
be
capable
of
being
known
by
inference
you
can
not
infer
that
the
axioms
of
geometry
are
true
because
its
conclusions
are
true
since
the
truth
of
the
conclusions
is
itself
a
consequence
of
the
truth
of
the
axioms
nor
yet
must
you
ask
for
demonstration
of
the
axioms
as
consequences
of
still
simpler
premisses
because
if
all
truths
can
be
proved
they
ought
to
be
proved
and
you
would
therefore
require
an
infinity
of
successive
demonstrations
to
prove
anything
whatever
but
under
such
conditions
all
knowledge
of
demonstrated
truth
would
be
impossible
the
first
principles
of
any
science
must
therefore
be
indemonstrable
they
must
be
known
as
facts
of
are
known
immediately
and
not
mediately
how
then
do
we
come
by
our
knowledge
of
them
aristotle
s
answer
to
this
question
appears
at
first
sight
curiously
contradictory
he
seems
to
say
that
these
simplest
truths
are
apprehended
intuitively
or
on
inspection
as
by
intelligence
or
mind
on
the
other
hand
he
also
says
that
they
are
known
as
a
result
of
induction
from
thus
he
to
be
either
a
platonist
or
an
empiricist
according
as
you
choose
to
remember
one
set
of
his
utterances
or
another
and
this
apparent
inconsistency
has
led
to
his
authority
being
claimed
in
their
favour
by
thinkers
of
the
most
widely
different
types
but
more
careful
study
will
show
that
the
seeming
confusion
is
due
to
the
fact
that
he
tries
to
combine
in
one
statement
his
answers
to
two
quite
different
questions
how
we
come
to
reflect
on
the
axioms
what
evidence
there
is
for
their
truth
to
the
first
question
he
replies
by
induction
from
experience
and
so
far
he
might
seem
to
be
a
precursor
of
john
stuart
mill
successive
repetitions
of
the
same
give
rise
to
a
single
experience
and
it
is
by
reflection
on
experience
that
we
become
aware
of
the
most
ultimate
simple
and
universal
principles
we
might
illustrate
his
point
by
considering
how
the
thought
that
two
and
two
are
four
may
be
brought
before
a
child
s
mind
we
might
first
take
two
apples
and
two
other
apples
and
set
the
child
to
count
them
by
repeating
the
process
with
different
apples
we
may
teach
the
child
to
dissociate
the
result
of
the
counting
from
the
particular
apples
employed
and
to
advance
to
the
thought
any
two
apples
and
any
two
other
apples
make
four
apples
then
we
might
substitute
pears
or
cherries
for
the
apples
so
as
to
suggest
the
thought
two
fruits
and
two
fruits
make
four
fruits
and
by
similar
methods
we
should
in
the
end
evoke
the
thought
any
two
objects
whatever
and
any
other
two
objects
whatever
make
four
objects
this
exactly
illustrates
aristotle
s
conception
of
the
function
of
induction
or
comparison
of
instances
in
fixing
attention
on
a
universal
principle
of
which
one
had
not
been
conscious
before
the
comparison
was
made
now
comes
in
the
point
where
aristotle
differs
wholly
from
all
empiricists
later
and
earlier
mill
regards
the
instances
produced
in
the
induction
as
having
a
double
function
they
not
merely
fix
the
attention
on
the
principle
they
also
are
the
evidence
of
its
truth
this
gives
rise
to
the
greatest
difficulty
in
his
whole
logical
theory
induction
by
imperfect
enumeration
is
pronounced
to
be
as
it
clearly
is
fallacious
yet
the
principle
of
the
uniformity
of
nature
which
mill
regards
as
the
ultimate
premiss
of
all
science
is
itself
supposed
to
be
proved
by
this
radically
fallacious
method
aristotle
avoids
a
similar
inconsistency
by
holding
that
the
sole
function
of
the
induction
is
to
fix
our
attention
on
a
principle
which
it
does
not
prove
he
holds
that
ultimate
principles
neither
permit
of
nor
require
proof
when
the
induction
has
done
its
work
in
calling
attention
to
the
principle
you
have
to
see
for
yourself
that
the
principle
is
true
you
see
that
it
is
true
by
immediate
inspection
just
as
in
you
have
to
see
that
the
colour
before
your
eyes
is
red
or
blue
this
is
why
aristotle
holds
that
the
knowledge
of
the
principles
of
science
is
not
itself
science
demonstrated
knowledge
but
what
he
calls
intelligence
and
we
may
call
intellectual
intuition
thus
his
doctrine
is
sharply
distinguished
not
only
from
empiricism
the
doctrine
that
universal
principles
are
proved
by
particular
facts
but
also
from
all
theories
of
the
hegelian
type
which
regard
the
principles
and
the
facts
as
somehow
reciprocally
proving
each
other
and
from
the
doctrine
of
some
eminent
modern
logicians
who
hold
that
is
not
required
in
the
ultimate
principles
of
science
as
we
are
only
concerned
in
logic
with
the
question
what
consequences
follow
from
our
initial
assumptions
and
not
with
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
the
assumptions
themselves
the
result
is
that
aristotle
does
little
more
than
repeat
the
platonic
view
of
the
nature
of
science
science
consists
of
deductions
from
universal
principles
which
sensible
experience
suggests
but
into
which
as
they
are
apprehended
by
a
purely
intellectual
inspection
no
enter
as
constituents
the
apparent
rejection
of
transcendental
moonshine
has
after
all
led
to
nothing
the
only
difference
between
plato
and
his
scholar
lies
in
the
clearness
of
intellectual
vision
which
plato
shows
when
he
expressly
maintains
in
plain
words
that
the
universals
of
exact
science
are
not
in
our
and
therefore
to
be
extracted
from
them
by
a
process
of
abstraction
but
are
apart
from
or
over
them
and
form
an
ideal
system
of
interconnected
concepts
which
the
experiences
of
sense
merely
imitate
or
make
approximation
to
one
more
point
remains
to
be
considered
to
complete
our
outline
of
the
aristotelian
theory
of
knowledge
the
sciences
have
principles
which
are
discerned
to
be
true
by
immediate
inspection
but
what
if
one
man
professes
to
see
the
truth
of
such
an
alleged
principle
while
another
is
doubtful
of
its
truth
or
even
denies
it
there
can
be
no
question
of
silencing
the
objector
by
a
demonstration
since
no
genuine
simple
principle
admits
of
demonstration
all
that
can
be
done
if
a
man
doubts
whether
things
equal
to
the
same
thing
are
equal
to
one
another
or
whether
the
law
of
contradiction
is
true
is
to
examine
the
consequences
of
a
denial
of
the
axiom
and
to
show
that
they
include
some
which
are
false
or
which
your
antagonist
at
least
considers
false
in
this
way
by
showing
the
falsity
of
consequences
which
follow
from
the
denial
of
a
given
principle
you
indirectly
establish
its
truth
now
reasoning
of
this
kind
differs
from
science
precisely
in
the
point
that
you
take
as
your
major
premiss
not
what
you
regard
as
true
but
the
opposite
thesis
of
your
antagonist
which
you
regard
as
false
your
object
is
not
to
prove
a
true
conclusion
but
to
show
your
opponent
that
premisses
lead
to
false
conclusions
this
is
dialectical
reasoning
in
aristotle
s
sense
of
the
word
reasoning
not
from
your
own
but
from
some
one
else
s
premisses
hence
the
chief
philosophical
importance
which
aristotle
ascribes
to
dialectic
is
that
it
provides
a
method
of
defending
the
undemonstrable
axioms
against
objections
dialectic
of
this
kind
became
highly
important
in
the
mediæval
aristotelianism
of
the
schoolmen
with
whom
it
became
a
regular
method
as
may
be
seen
in
the
of
thomas
to
begin
their
consideration
of
a
doctrine
by
a
preliminary
rehearsal
of
all
the
arguments
they
could
find
or
devise
against
the
conclusion
they
meant
to
adopt
thus
the
first
division
of
any
article
in
the
of
thomas
is
regularly
constituted
by
arguments
based
on
the
premisses
of
actual
or
possible
antagonists
and
is
strictly
dialectical
to
be
quite
accurate
aristotle
should
of
course
have
observed
that
this
dialectical
method
of
defending
a
principle
becomes
useless
in
the
case
of
a
logical
axiom
which
is
presupposed
by
all
deduction
for
this
reason
aristotle
falls
into
fallacy
when
he
tries
to
defend
the
law
of
contradiction
by
dialectic
it
is
true
that
if
the
law
be
denied
then
any
and
every
predicate
may
be
indifferently
ascribed
to
any
subject
but
until
the
law
of
contradiction
has
been
admitted
you
have
no
right
to
regard
it
as
absurd
to
ascribe
all
predicates
indiscriminately
to
all
subjects
thus
it
is
only
assumed
laws
which
are
ultimate
laws
of
logic
that
admit
of
dialectical
justification
if
a
truth
is
so
ultimate
that
it
has
either
to
be
recognised
by
direct
inspection
or
not
at
all
there
can
be
no
arguing
at
all
with
one
who
can
not
or
will
not
see
it
first
philosophy
is
defined
by
aristotle
as
a
science
which
considers
what
is
simply
in
its
character
of
being
and
the
properties
which
it
has
as
such
that
there
is
or
ought
to
be
such
a
science
is
urged
on
the
ground
that
every
special
science
deals
only
with
some
restricted
department
of
what
is
and
thus
considers
its
not
universally
in
its
character
of
being
or
being
real
but
as
determined
by
some
more
special
condition
thus
first
philosophy
the
science
which
attempts
to
discover
the
most
ultimate
reasons
of
or
grounds
for
the
character
of
things
in
general
can
not
be
identified
with
any
of
the
departmental
sciences
the
same
consideration
explains
why
it
is
first
philosophy
which
has
to
disentangle
the
principles
of
the
various
sciences
and
defend
them
by
dialectic
against
those
who
impugn
them
it
is
no
part
of
the
duty
of
a
geometer
or
a
physicist
to
deal
with
objections
to
such
universal
principles
of
reasoning
as
the
law
of
contradiction
they
may
safely
assume
such
principles
if
they
are
attacked
it
is
not
by
specifically
geometrical
or
physical
considerations
that
they
can
be
defended
even
the
principles
of
the
special
sciences
have
not
to
be
examined
and
defended
by
the
special
sciences
they
are
the
of
the
sciences
which
employ
them
these
sciences
are
therefore
justified
in
requiring
that
they
shall
be
admitted
as
a
condition
of
geometrical
or
physical
or
biological
demonstrations
if
they
are
called
in
question
the
defence
of
them
is
the
business
of
logic
first
philosophy
then
is
the
study
of
what
is
simply
as
such
the
universal
principles
of
structure
without
which
there
could
be
no
ordered
system
of
knowable
objects
but
the
word
is
has
more
than
one
sense
there
are
as
many
modes
of
being
as
there
are
types
of
predication
substances
men
horses
and
the
like
have
their
own
specific
mode
of
being
they
are
things
qualities
such
as
green
or
sweet
have
a
different
mode
of
being
they
are
not
things
but
affections
or
attributes
of
things
actions
again
such
as
building
killing
are
neither
things
nor
yet
affections
of
things
their
mode
of
being
is
that
they
are
processes
which
produce
or
destroy
things
first
philosophy
is
concerned
with
the
general
character
of
all
these
modes
of
being
but
it
is
specially
concerned
with
that
mode
of
being
which
belongs
to
for
this
is
the
most
primary
of
all
modes
of
being
we
had
to
introduce
a
reference
to
it
in
our
attempt
to
say
what
the
mode
of
being
of
qualities
and
actions
is
and
it
would
have
been
the
same
had
our
illustrations
been
drawn
from
any
other
categories
hence
the
central
and
special
problem
of
first
philosophy
is
to
analyse
the
notion
of
substance
and
to
show
the
causes
of
the
existence
of
substances
next
we
have
to
note
that
the
word
substance
itself
has
two
senses
when
we
spoke
of
substance
as
one
of
the
categories
we
were
using
it
in
a
secondary
sense
we
meant
by
substances
horse
man
and
the
rest
of
the
real
kinds
which
we
find
in
nature
and
try
to
reproduce
in
a
scientific
classification
in
this
sense
of
the
word
substances
are
a
special
class
of
as
when
we
affirm
of
plato
that
he
is
a
man
or
of
bucephalus
that
he
is
a
horse
but
in
the
primary
sense
a
substance
means
an
absolutely
individual
thing
man
or
horse
we
may
therefore
define
primary
substances
from
the
logician
s
point
of
view
by
saying
that
they
can
be
only
subjects
of
predication
never
predicates
or
again
it
is
peculiar
to
substances
that
while
remaining
numerically
one
a
substance
admits
of
incompatible
determinations
as
socrates
remaining
one
and
the
same
socrates
is
successively
young
and
old
this
is
not
true
of
qualities
actions
and
the
rest
the
same
colour
can
not
be
first
white
and
then
black
the
same
act
can
not
be
first
bad
and
then
good
thus
we
may
say
that
individual
substances
are
the
fixed
and
permanent
factors
in
the
world
of
mutability
the
invariants
of
existence
processes
go
on
in
them
they
run
the
gamut
of
changes
from
birth
to
decay
processes
take
place
them
they
act
on
and
are
acted
on
by
one
another
they
fluctuate
in
their
qualities
and
their
magnitude
but
so
long
as
a
substance
exists
it
remains
numerically
one
and
the
same
throughout
all
these
changes
their
existence
is
the
first
and
most
fundamental
condition
of
the
existence
of
the
universe
since
they
are
the
bearers
of
all
qualities
the
terms
of
all
relations
and
the
agents
and
patients
in
all
interaction
the
point
to
note
is
that
aristotle
begins
his
investigation
into
the
structure
of
what
is
and
the
causes
by
which
it
is
produced
by
starting
from
the
existence
of
individual
things
belonging
to
the
physical
order
and
perceived
by
the
senses
about
any
such
thing
we
may
ask
two
questions
into
what
constituent
factors
can
it
be
logically
analysed
and
how
has
it
come
to
exhibit
the
character
which
our
analysis
shows
it
to
have
the
answer
to
these
questions
will
appear
from
a
consideration
of
two
standing
antitheses
which
run
through
aristotle
s
philosophy
the
contrast
between
matter
and
form
and
that
between
potential
and
actual
followed
by
a
recapitulation
of
his
doctrine
of
the
four
causes
or
four
senses
of
the
word
cause
and
consider
any
completely
developed
individual
thing
whether
it
is
the
product
of
human
manufacture
as
a
copper
bowl
or
of
natural
reproduction
as
an
or
a
horse
we
shall
see
at
once
that
the
bowl
is
like
other
articles
made
of
the
same
metal
candlesticks
in
being
made
of
the
same
stuff
and
unlike
them
in
having
the
special
shape
or
structure
which
renders
it
fit
for
being
used
as
a
bowl
and
not
for
holding
a
candle
or
containing
coals
so
a
botanist
or
a
chemist
will
tell
you
that
the
constituent
tissues
of
an
oak
or
horse
or
the
chemical
elements
out
of
which
these
tissues
are
built
up
are
of
the
same
kind
as
those
of
an
ash
or
an
ox
but
the
oak
differs
from
the
ash
or
the
horse
from
the
ox
in
characteristic
structure
we
see
thus
that
in
any
individual
thing
we
can
distinguish
two
components
the
stuff
of
which
it
consists
which
may
be
identical
in
kind
with
the
stuff
of
which
things
of
a
very
different
kind
consist
and
the
structural
law
of
formation
or
arrangement
which
is
peculiar
to
the
special
kind
of
thing
under
consideration
in
the
actual
individual
thing
these
two
are
inseparably
united
they
do
not
exist
side
by
side
as
chemists
say
the
atoms
of
hydrogen
and
oxygen
do
in
a
drop
of
water
the
law
of
organisation
or
structure
is
manifested
in
and
through
the
copper
or
the
various
tissues
of
the
living
body
aristotle
expresses
this
by
saying
that
you
can
distinguish
two
aspects
in
an
individual
its
matter
and
its
form
the
individual
is
the
matter
as
organised
in
accord
with
a
determinate
principle
of
structure
the
form
of
these
terms
the
former
matter
means
literally
timber
and
more
specifically
ship
s
timbers
and
his
selection
of
it
to
mean
what
is
most
exactly
rendered
by
our
own
word
stuff
may
perhaps
be
due
to
a
reminiscence
of
an
old
pythagorean
fancy
which
looked
on
the
universe
as
a
ship
the
word
for
form
is
the
same
as
plato
s
and
its
philosophical
uses
are
closely
connected
with
its
mathematical
sense
regular
figure
also
a
pythagorean
technicality
which
still
survives
in
certain
stereotyped
phrases
in
euclid
aristotle
extends
the
analysis
into
matter
and
form
by
analogy
beyond
the
range
of
individual
substances
to
everything
in
which
we
can
distinguish
a
relatively
indeterminate
somewhat
and
a
law
or
type
of
order
and
arrangement
giving
it
determination
thus
if
you
consider
the
relatively
fixed
or
formed
character
of
a
man
in
adult
life
we
may
look
upon
this
character
as
produced
out
of
the
raw
material
of
tendencies
and
dispositions
which
have
received
a
specific
development
along
definite
lines
according
to
the
kind
of
training
to
which
the
mind
has
been
subjected
in
the
formative
period
of
its
growth
we
may
therefore
speak
of
native
disposition
as
the
matter
or
stuff
of
which
character
is
made
and
the
practical
problem
of
education
is
to
devise
a
system
of
training
which
shall
impress
on
this
matter
precisely
the
form
required
if
the
grown
man
is
to
be
a
good
citizen
of
a
good
state
since
a
man
s
character
itself
is
not
a
substance
but
a
complex
of
habits
or
fixed
ways
of
reacting
upon
suggestions
coming
from
the
world
around
him
this
is
a
good
instance
of
the
extension
of
the
antithesis
of
matter
and
form
beyond
the
category
of
substance
we
see
then
that
matter
in
the
aristotelian
sense
must
not
be
confounded
with
body
the
relatively
undetermined
factor
which
receives
completer
determination
by
the
structural
law
or
form
is
matter
whether
it
is
corporeal
or
not
this
comes
out
with
particular
clearness
in
the
metaphysical
interpretation
put
on
the
logical
process
of
definition
by
genus
and
difference
when
i
define
any
real
kind
by
specifying
a
higher
and
wider
class
of
which
it
is
a
and
adding
the
peculiar
characteristics
which
distinguish
the
under
consideration
from
the
other
of
the
same
genus
the
genus
may
be
said
to
stand
to
the
differences
as
matter
the
relatively
indeterminate
to
the
form
which
gives
it
its
structure
we
further
observe
that
matter
and
form
are
strictly
correlative
the
matter
is
called
so
relatively
to
the
form
which
gives
it
further
determination
when
the
words
are
used
in
their
strictest
sense
with
reference
to
an
individual
thing
the
form
is
taken
to
mean
the
determination
by
which
the
thing
acquires
its
complete
character
and
the
matter
is
that
which
has
yet
to
receive
this
last
determination
thus
in
the
case
of
a
copper
globe
the
spherical
figure
is
said
to
be
its
form
the
copper
its
material
in
the
case
of
the
human
body
the
matter
is
the
various
tissues
muscles
bones
skin
but
each
of
these
things
which
are
counted
as
belonging
to
the
matter
of
the
globe
or
the
human
body
has
according
to
aristotle
a
development
behind
it
copper
is
not
an
element
but
a
specific
combination
of
elements
and
the
same
thing
is
even
more
true
of
the
highly
elaborate
tissues
of
the
living
body
thus
what
is
matter
relatively
to
the
globe
or
living
body
is
matter
already
determined
by
form
if
we
consider
it
relatively
to
its
own
constituents
the
elements
of
empedocles
earth
water
air
fire
are
the
matter
of
all
chemical
compounds
the
form
of
each
compound
being
its
specific
law
of
composition
the
immediate
or
proximate
matter
of
the
tissues
of
the
animal
body
is
according
to
aristotle
s
biology
the
superfluous
blood
of
the
female
parent
out
of
which
the
various
tissues
in
the
offspring
are
developed
and
the
matter
of
this
blood
is
in
turn
the
various
substances
which
are
taken
into
the
body
of
the
parent
as
food
and
converted
by
assimilation
into
blood
their
matter
once
more
is
the
earth
air
fire
and
water
of
which
they
are
composed
thus
at
every
stage
of
a
process
of
manufacture
or
growth
a
fresh
form
is
superinduced
on
or
developed
within
a
matter
which
is
already
itself
a
combination
of
matter
and
form
relatively
to
the
process
by
which
it
has
itself
been
originated
fully
thought
out
such
a
view
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
in
the
end
the
simple
ultimate
matter
of
all
individual
things
is
one
and
the
same
throughout
the
universe
and
has
absolutely
no
definite
structure
at
all
the
introduction
of
form
or
determinate
structure
of
any
kind
would
then
have
to
be
thought
of
as
coming
from
an
outside
source
since
structureless
matter
can
not
be
supposed
to
give
itself
all
sorts
of
specific
determinations
as
has
been
demonstrated
in
our
own
times
by
the
collapse
of
the
synthetic
philosophy
aristotle
avoids
the
difficulty
by
holding
that
pure
matter
is
a
creation
of
our
thought
in
actual
fact
the
crudest
form
in
which
matter
is
found
is
that
of
the
elements
since
the
transmutability
of
the
elements
is
an
indispensable
tenet
in
aristotle
s
physics
we
can
not
avoid
regarding
earth
water
fire
air
as
themselves
determinations
by
specific
form
of
a
still
simpler
matter
though
this
prime
matter
all
alone
before
a
rag
of
form
is
on
is
never
to
be
found
existing
in
its
simplicity
pt
canto
he
had
first
matter
seen
undressed
he
took
her
naked
all
alone
before
one
rag
of
form
was
on
potential
and
the
so
far
we
have
been
looking
at
the
analysis
of
the
individual
thing
as
the
current
jargon
puts
it
statically
we
have
arrived
at
the
antithesis
of
matter
and
form
by
contrasting
an
unfinished
condition
of
anything
with
its
finished
condition
but
we
may
study
the
same
contrast
dynamically
with
special
reference
to
the
process
of
making
or
growth
by
which
the
relatively
undetermined
or
unfinished
becomes
determined
or
finished
the
contrast
of
matter
with
form
then
passes
into
the
contrast
between
potentiality
and
actuality
what
this
antithesis
means
we
can
best
see
from
the
case
of
the
growth
of
a
living
organism
consider
the
embryos
of
two
animals
or
the
seeds
of
two
plants
even
a
botanist
or
a
physiologist
may
be
unable
to
pronounce
with
certainty
on
the
species
to
which
the
germ
submitted
to
him
belongs
and
chemical
analysis
may
be
equally
at
a
loss
even
at
a
later
stage
of
development
the
embryo
of
one
vertebrate
animal
may
be
indistinguishable
from
that
of
another
yet
it
is
certain
that
one
of
two
originally
indistinguishable
germs
will
grow
into
an
oak
and
the
other
into
an
elm
or
one
into
a
chimpanzee
and
the
other
into
a
man
however
indistinguishable
they
therefore
may
be
said
to
have
different
latent
tendencies
or
possibilities
of
development
within
them
hence
we
may
say
of
a
given
germ
though
this
is
not
yet
actually
an
oak
it
is
potentially
an
oak
meaning
not
merely
that
if
uninterfered
with
it
will
in
time
be
an
oak
but
also
that
by
no
interference
can
it
be
made
to
grow
into
an
elm
or
a
beech
so
we
may
look
upon
all
processes
of
production
or
development
as
processes
by
which
what
at
first
possessed
only
the
tendency
to
grow
along
certain
lines
or
to
be
worked
up
into
a
certain
form
has
become
actually
endowed
with
the
character
to
which
it
possessed
the
tendency
the
acorn
becomes
in
process
of
time
an
actual
oak
the
baby
an
actual
man
the
copper
is
made
into
an
actual
vase
right
education
brings
out
into
active
exercise
the
special
capacities
of
the
learner
hence
the
distinction
between
matter
and
form
may
also
be
expressed
by
saying
that
the
matter
is
the
persistent
underlying
in
which
the
development
of
the
form
takes
place
or
that
the
individual
when
finally
determined
by
the
form
is
the
actuality
of
which
the
undeveloped
matter
was
the
potentiality
the
process
of
conception
birth
and
growth
to
maturity
in
nature
or
of
the
production
of
a
finished
article
by
the
arts
whose
business
it
is
to
imitate
nature
may
be
said
to
be
one
of
continuous
advance
towards
the
actual
embodiment
of
a
form
or
law
of
organisation
in
a
matter
having
the
latent
potentiality
of
developing
along
those
special
lines
when
aristotle
is
speaking
most
strictly
he
distinguishes
the
process
by
which
a
form
is
realised
which
he
calls
energeia
from
the
manifestation
of
the
realised
form
calling
the
latter
entelechy
literally
finished
or
completed
condition
often
however
he
uses
the
word
energeia
more
loosely
for
the
actual
manifestation
of
the
form
itself
and
in
this
he
is
followed
by
the
scholastic
writers
who
render
energeia
by
or
one
presupposition
of
this
process
must
be
specially
noted
it
is
not
an
unending
process
of
development
of
unrealised
capacities
but
always
has
an
end
in
the
perfectly
simple
sense
of
a
last
stage
we
see
this
best
in
the
case
of
growth
the
acorn
grows
into
the
sapling
and
the
sapling
into
the
oak
but
there
is
nothing
related
to
the
oak
as
the
oak
is
to
the
sapling
the
oak
does
not
grow
into
something
else
the
process
of
development
from
potential
to
actual
in
this
special
case
comes
to
an
end
with
the
emergence
of
the
mature
oak
in
the
organic
world
the
end
or
last
state
is
recognised
by
the
fact
that
the
organism
can
now
exercise
the
power
of
reproducing
its
like
this
tendency
of
organic
process
to
culminate
in
a
last
stage
of
complete
maturity
is
the
key
to
the
treatment
of
the
problem
of
the
true
end
of
life
in
aristotle
s
four
the
conception
of
the
world
involved
in
these
antitheses
of
form
and
matter
potential
and
actual
finds
its
fullest
expression
in
aristotle
s
doctrine
of
the
four
causes
or
conditions
of
the
production
of
things
this
doctrine
is
looked
on
by
aristotle
as
the
final
solution
of
the
problem
which
had
always
been
the
central
one
for
greek
philosophy
what
are
the
causes
of
the
all
the
previous
philosophies
he
regards
as
inadequate
attempts
to
formulate
the
answer
to
this
question
which
is
only
given
completely
by
his
own
system
hence
the
doctrine
requires
to
be
stated
with
some
fullness
we
may
best
approach
it
by
starting
from
the
literal
meaning
of
the
greek
terms
which
aristotle
uses
to
convey
the
notion
of
cause
is
properly
an
adjective
used
substantially
and
means
that
on
which
the
legal
responsibility
for
a
given
state
of
affairs
can
be
laid
similarly
the
substantive
means
the
credit
for
good
or
bad
the
legal
responsibility
for
an
act
now
when
we
ask
what
is
responsible
for
the
fact
that
such
and
such
a
state
of
things
now
exists
there
are
four
partial
answers
which
may
be
given
and
each
of
these
corresponds
to
one
of
the
causes
a
complete
answer
requires
the
enumeration
of
them
all
we
may
mention
the
or
cause
of
the
thing
the
law
according
to
which
it
has
grown
or
developed
the
or
cause
the
agent
with
whose
initial
impulse
the
development
began
the
of
the
process
or
as
the
later
aristotelians
call
it
the
cause
the
completed
result
of
the
whole
process
which
is
present
in
the
case
of
human
manufacture
as
a
preconceived
idea
determining
the
maker
s
whole
method
of
handling
his
material
and
in
organic
development
in
nature
as
implied
in
and
determining
the
successive
stages
of
growth
the
or
cause
if
any
one
of
these
had
been
different
the
resultant
state
of
things
would
also
have
been
different
hence
all
four
must
be
specified
in
completely
accounting
for
it
obvious
illustrations
can
be
given
from
artificial
products
of
human
skill
but
it
seems
clear
that
it
was
rather
reflection
on
the
biological
process
of
reproduction
and
growth
which
originally
suggested
the
analysis
suppose
we
ask
what
was
requisite
in
order
that
there
should
be
now
an
oak
on
a
given
spot
there
must
have
been
a
germ
from
which
the
oak
has
grown
and
this
germ
must
have
had
the
latent
tendencies
towards
development
which
are
characteristic
of
oaks
this
is
the
material
cause
of
the
oak
this
germ
must
have
followed
a
definite
law
of
growth
it
must
have
had
a
tendency
to
grow
in
the
way
characteristic
of
oaks
and
to
develop
the
structure
of
an
oak
not
that
of
a
plane
or
an
ash
this
is
form
or
formal
cause
also
the
germ
of
the
oak
did
not
come
from
nowhere
it
grew
on
a
parent
oak
the
parent
oak
and
its
activity
thus
constitute
the
cause
of
the
present
oak
and
there
must
be
a
final
stage
to
which
the
whole
process
of
growth
is
relative
in
which
the
germ
or
sapling
is
no
longer
becoming
but
is
an
adult
oak
bearing
fresh
acorns
this
is
the
of
the
process
one
would
not
be
going
far
wrong
in
saying
that
aristotle
s
biological
cast
of
thought
leads
him
to
conceive
of
this
end
in
the
case
of
reproduction
as
a
purpose
just
as
the
workman
s
thought
of
the
result
to
be
attained
by
his
action
forms
a
conscious
directing
purpose
in
the
case
of
manufacture
both
in
nature
and
in
art
the
form
the
efficient
cause
and
the
end
tend
to
coalesce
thus
in
nature
a
man
begets
a
man
organic
beings
give
birth
to
other
organic
beings
of
the
same
kind
or
in
the
technical
language
of
the
aristotelian
theory
of
causation
the
efficient
cause
produces
as
the
end
of
its
action
a
second
being
having
the
same
form
as
itself
though
realised
in
different
matter
and
numerically
distinct
from
itself
thus
the
efficient
cause
the
parent
is
a
form
realised
in
matter
and
the
end
is
the
same
form
realised
in
other
matter
so
in
products
of
art
the
true
source
of
the
process
is
the
form
the
realisation
of
which
is
the
end
or
final
cause
only
with
this
difference
that
as
efficient
cause
the
form
exists
not
in
the
material
but
by
way
of
idea
or
representation
in
the
mind
of
the
craftsman
a
house
does
not
produce
another
house
but
the
house
as
existing
in
idea
in
the
builder
s
mind
sets
him
at
work
building
and
so
produces
a
corresponding
house
in
brick
or
stone
thus
the
ultimate
opposition
is
between
the
cause
as
matter
a
passive
and
inert
substratum
of
change
and
development
and
the
formal
cause
which
in
the
sense
just
explained
is
one
with
both
the
efficient
or
and
the
end
or
goal
of
development
it
will
of
course
be
seen
that
individual
bearers
of
forms
are
indispensable
in
the
theory
hence
the
notion
of
is
essential
to
the
causal
relation
it
is
a
relation
between
things
not
between
events
aristotle
has
no
sense
of
the
word
cause
corresponding
to
mill
s
conception
of
a
cause
as
an
event
which
is
the
uniform
precursor
of
another
event
two
more
remarks
may
be
made
in
this
connection
the
prominence
of
the
notion
of
end
gives
aristotle
s
philosophy
a
ideological
character
god
and
nature
he
tells
us
do
nothing
aimlessly
we
should
probably
be
mistaken
if
we
took
this
to
mean
that
god
and
nature
act
everywhere
with
conscious
design
the
meaning
is
rather
that
every
natural
process
has
a
last
stage
in
which
the
form
which
was
to
begin
with
present
in
the
agent
or
source
of
change
is
fully
realised
in
the
matter
in
which
the
agent
has
set
up
the
process
of
change
the
normal
thing
is
for
animals
to
reproduce
their
kind
if
the
reproduction
is
imperfect
or
distorted
as
in
monstrous
births
this
is
an
exception
due
to
the
occasional
presence
in
matter
of
imperfections
which
hinder
the
course
of
development
and
must
be
regarded
as
contrary
to
the
normal
course
of
nature
so
hybrid
reproduction
is
exceptional
and
against
nature
and
this
is
shown
by
the
sterility
of
hybrids
a
sort
of
lesser
monstrosity
even
females
being
arrested
developments
are
a
sort
of
still
minor
deviation
from
principle
it
may
just
be
mentioned
that
aristotle
has
a
classification
of
efficient
causes
under
the
three
heads
of
nature
intelligence
or
man
and
chance
the
difference
between
nature
and
man
or
intelligence
as
efficient
causes
has
already
been
illustrated
it
is
that
in
causation
by
nature
such
as
sexual
reproduction
or
the
assimilation
of
nutriment
or
the
conversion
of
one
element
into
another
in
which
aristotle
believed
the
form
which
is
superinduced
on
the
matter
by
the
agent
already
exists
in
the
agent
itself
as
form
the
oak
springs
from
a
parent
oak
the
conversion
of
nutriment
into
organic
tissue
is
due
to
the
agency
of
already
existing
organic
tissue
in
the
case
of
human
intelligence
or
art
the
form
to
be
superinduced
exists
in
the
agent
not
as
characteristic
form
but
by
way
of
representation
as
a
contemplated
design
the
man
who
builds
a
house
is
not
himself
a
house
the
form
characteristic
of
a
house
is
very
different
from
that
characteristic
of
a
man
but
it
is
present
in
contemplation
to
the
builder
before
it
is
embodied
in
the
actual
house
a
word
may
be
added
about
the
third
sort
of
efficient
causality
causation
by
chance
this
is
confined
to
cases
which
are
exceptions
from
the
general
course
of
nature
remarkable
coincidences
it
is
what
we
may
call
simulated
purposiveness
when
something
in
human
affairs
happens
in
a
way
which
subserves
the
achievement
of
a
result
but
was
not
really
brought
about
by
any
intention
to
secure
the
result
we
speak
of
it
as
a
remarkable
coincidence
thus
it
would
be
a
coincidence
if
a
man
should
be
held
to
ransom
by
brigands
and
his
best
friend
should
without
knowing
anything
of
the
matter
turn
up
on
the
spot
with
the
means
of
ransoming
him
the
events
could
not
have
happened
more
opportunely
if
they
had
been
planned
and
yet
they
were
not
planned
but
merely
fell
out
so
and
since
such
a
combination
of
circumstances
simulating
design
is
unusual
it
is
not
proper
to
say
that
the
events
happened
in
the
course
of
nature
we
therefore
say
it
happened
by
chance
this
doctrine
of
chance
has
its
significance
for
mediæval
ethics
in
an
age
when
the
protestant
superstition
that
worldly
success
is
proof
of
nearness
to
god
had
not
yet
been
invented
the
want
of
correspondence
between
men
s
deserts
and
their
prosperity
was
accounted
for
by
the
view
that
the
distribution
of
worldly
goods
is
as
a
rule
the
work
of
fortune
or
chance
in
the
aristotelian
sense
that
is
it
is
due
to
special
coincidences
which
may
look
like
deliberate
design
but
are
not
really
so
see
the
elaborate
exposition
of
this
in
dante
vii
we
have
seen
that
causation
natural
or
artificial
requires
the
production
in
a
certain
matter
of
a
certain
form
under
the
influence
of
a
certain
agent
what
is
the
character
of
the
process
set
up
by
the
agent
in
the
matter
and
culminating
in
the
appearance
of
the
form
aristotle
answers
that
it
is
motion
the
effect
of
the
agent
on
the
matter
is
to
set
up
in
it
a
motion
which
ends
in
its
assuming
a
definite
form
the
important
point
to
be
noted
here
is
that
aristotle
regards
this
motion
as
falling
wholly
within
the
matter
which
is
to
assume
the
form
it
is
not
necessary
that
the
agent
should
itself
be
in
motion
but
only
that
it
should
induce
motion
in
something
else
thus
in
all
cases
of
intentional
action
the
ultimate
efficient
cause
is
the
idea
of
the
result
to
be
attained
but
this
idea
does
not
move
about
by
its
presence
to
the
mind
it
sets
something
else
the
members
of
the
body
moving
this
conception
of
an
efficient
cause
which
not
moving
itself
by
its
mere
presence
induces
movement
in
that
to
which
it
is
present
is
of
the
highest
importance
in
aristotle
s
theology
of
course
it
follows
that
since
the
motion
by
which
the
transition
from
potentiality
to
actuality
is
achieved
falls
wholly
within
the
matter
acted
upon
aristotle
is
not
troubled
with
any
of
the
questions
as
to
the
way
in
which
motion
can
be
transferred
from
one
body
to
another
which
were
so
much
agitated
in
the
early
days
of
the
modern
mechanical
interpretation
of
natural
processes
aristotle
s
way
of
conceiving
nature
is
thoroughly
and
approximates
to
what
would
now
be
called
the
ascription
of
vital
or
characteristics
to
the
inorganic
as
in
the
causality
of
art
the
mere
presence
of
the
form
to
be
embodied
in
a
given
material
to
the
mind
of
the
craftsman
brings
about
and
directs
the
process
of
manufacture
so
in
some
analogous
fashion
the
presence
of
an
efficient
cause
in
nature
to
that
on
which
it
works
is
thought
of
as
itself
constituting
the
efficiency
of
the
cause
as
lotze
phrases
it
things
take
note
of
one
another
s
compresence
in
the
universe
or
we
might
say
the
efficient
cause
and
that
on
which
it
exercises
its
efficiency
are
matter
is
sensitive
to
the
presence
of
the
efficient
cause
and
in
response
to
this
sensitivity
puts
forth
successive
determinations
expands
its
latent
tendencies
on
definite
lines
the
name
motion
has
a
wider
sense
for
aristotle
than
it
has
for
ourselves
he
includes
under
the
one
common
name
all
the
processes
by
which
things
come
to
be
what
they
are
or
cease
to
be
what
they
have
been
thus
he
distinguishes
the
following
varieties
of
motion
the
coming
of
an
individual
thing
into
being
with
its
opposite
or
the
passing
of
a
thing
out
of
being
change
of
in
a
thing
and
change
in
the
of
a
thing
through
of
which
latter
he
recognises
two
rectilinear
and
in
a
circular
orbit
about
an
axis
it
is
this
last
variety
motion
through
space
which
is
the
most
fundamental
of
all
since
its
occurrence
is
involved
in
that
of
any
of
the
other
types
of
process
mentioned
though
aristotle
does
not
hold
the
mechanical
view
that
the
other
processes
are
only
apparent
and
that
as
we
should
put
it
qualitative
change
is
a
mere
disguise
which
mechanical
motion
wears
for
our
senses
eternity
of
certain
very
important
consequences
follow
from
the
conception
of
efficient
causation
which
we
have
been
describing
aristotle
has
no
sympathy
with
the
evolutionist
views
which
had
been
favoured
by
some
of
his
predecessors
according
to
his
theory
of
organic
generation
it
takes
a
man
to
beget
a
man
where
there
is
a
baby
there
must
have
been
a
father
biological
kinds
representing
real
clefts
in
nature
the
process
of
the
production
of
a
young
generation
by
an
already
adult
generation
must
be
thought
of
as
without
beginning
and
without
end
there
can
be
no
natural
evolution
of
animals
of
one
species
from
individuals
of
a
different
kind
nor
does
it
occur
to
aristotle
to
take
into
account
the
possibility
of
creationism
the
sudden
coming
into
being
of
a
fully
fledged
first
generation
at
a
stroke
this
possibility
is
excluded
by
the
doctrine
that
the
matter
of
a
thing
must
exist
beforehand
as
an
indispensable
condition
of
the
production
of
that
thing
every
baby
as
we
said
must
have
had
a
father
but
that
father
must
also
have
been
a
baby
before
he
was
a
man
hence
the
perpetuation
of
unchanging
species
must
be
without
beginning
and
without
end
and
it
is
implied
that
all
the
various
processes
within
and
without
the
organism
apart
from
which
its
life
could
not
be
kept
up
must
be
equally
without
beginning
and
without
end
the
cosmos
or
orderly
world
of
natural
processes
is
strictly
eternal
motion
is
everlasting
and
continuous
or
unbroken
even
the
great
christian
theologians
who
built
upon
aristotle
could
not
absolutely
break
with
him
on
this
point
thomas
though
obliged
to
admit
that
the
world
was
actually
created
a
few
thousand
years
before
his
own
time
maintains
that
this
can
only
be
known
to
be
true
from
revelation
philosophically
it
is
equably
tenable
that
the
world
should
have
been
created
from
all
eternity
and
it
is
the
general
doctrine
of
scholasticism
that
the
expression
creation
only
denotes
the
absolute
dependence
of
the
world
on
god
for
its
being
when
we
say
god
created
the
world
out
of
nothing
we
mean
that
he
did
not
make
it
out
of
matter
that
it
depends
for
its
being
on
him
only
the
expression
is
purely
negative
in
its
import
with
the
doctrine
of
the
eternity
of
the
world
and
the
processes
which
make
up
its
life
we
come
close
to
the
culminating
theory
of
aristotelian
first
philosophy
its
doctrine
of
god
as
the
eternal
unchanging
source
of
all
change
movement
and
process
all
motion
is
a
process
within
matter
by
which
the
forms
latent
in
it
are
brought
into
actual
manifestation
and
the
process
only
takes
place
in
the
presence
of
an
adequate
efficient
cause
or
source
of
motion
hence
the
eternity
of
natural
processes
involves
the
existence
of
one
or
more
eternal
sources
of
motion
for
if
we
do
not
admit
the
existence
of
an
unoriginated
and
source
or
sources
of
motion
our
only
alternative
is
to
hold
that
the
is
due
to
a
series
of
sources
of
motion
existing
successively
but
such
a
view
would
leave
the
unity
and
unbroken
continuity
of
the
unaccounted
for
it
would
give
us
a
succession
of
processes
temporally
contiguous
not
one
unbroken
process
hence
we
argue
from
the
continuity
of
motion
to
its
dependence
on
a
source
or
sources
which
are
permanent
and
present
throughout
the
whole
everlasting
and
when
we
come
to
the
question
whether
there
is
only
one
such
ultimate
source
of
movement
for
the
whole
universe
or
several
aristotle
s
answer
is
that
the
supreme
unmoved
mover
is
one
one
is
enough
for
the
purpose
and
the
law
of
parcimony
forbids
us
to
assume
the
superfluous
this
then
is
the
aristotelian
conception
of
god
and
god
s
relation
to
the
world
god
is
the
one
supreme
unchanging
being
to
whose
presence
the
world
responds
with
the
whole
process
of
cosmic
development
the
ultimate
educer
of
the
series
of
forms
latent
in
the
matter
of
the
world
into
actual
manifestation
standing
as
he
does
outside
the
whole
process
which
by
his
mere
presence
he
initiates
in
nature
he
is
not
himself
a
composite
of
form
and
matter
as
the
products
of
development
are
he
is
a
pure
individual
form
or
actuality
with
no
history
of
gradual
development
behind
it
thus
he
is
a
purely
immaterial
being
indispensable
to
the
world
s
existence
but
transcending
it
and
standing
outside
it
his
presence
inspires
the
world
to
move
aristotle
tries
to
explain
by
the
metaphor
of
appetition
just
as
the
good
i
desire
and
conceive
without
itself
moving
moves
my
appetition
so
god
moves
the
universe
by
being
its
good
this
directly
brings
about
a
uniform
unbroken
rotation
of
the
whole
universe
round
its
axis
in
fact
the
alternation
of
day
and
night
and
since
this
rotation
is
communicated
from
the
outermost
sphere
of
heaven
to
all
the
lesser
spheres
between
it
and
the
immovable
centre
the
effects
of
god
s
presence
are
felt
universally
at
the
same
time
we
must
note
that
though
god
is
the
supreme
mover
of
the
universe
he
is
not
regarded
by
aristotle
as
its
creator
even
in
the
sense
in
which
creation
can
be
reconciled
with
the
eternity
of
the
world
for
the
effect
of
god
s
presence
is
simply
to
lead
to
the
development
of
form
in
an
already
existing
matter
without
god
there
could
be
no
form
or
order
in
things
not
even
as
much
as
is
implied
in
the
differentiation
of
matter
into
the
four
elements
yet
primary
matter
is
no
less
than
god
a
precondition
of
all
that
happens
it
is
characteristic
of
aristotle
that
his
god
is
as
far
from
discharging
the
functions
of
a
providence
as
he
is
from
being
a
creator
his
activity
is
not
as
plato
had
made
it
that
of
the
great
shepherd
of
the
sheep
as
far
as
the
world
is
concerned
god
s
only
function
is
to
be
there
to
move
its
appetition
for
the
rest
the
unbroken
activity
of
this
life
is
directed
wholly
inward
aristotle
expressly
calls
it
an
activity
of
immobility
more
precisely
he
tells
us
it
is
activity
of
thought
exercised
unbrokenly
and
everlastingly
upon
the
only
object
adequate
to
exercise
god
s
contemplation
himself
his
life
is
one
of
everlasting
or
thinking
of
thought
itself
like
all
unimpeded
exercise
of
activity
it
is
attended
by
pleasure
and
as
the
activity
is
continuous
so
the
pleasure
of
it
is
continuous
too
at
our
best
when
we
give
ourselves
up
to
the
pure
contemplative
activity
of
scientific
thought
or
æsthetic
appreciation
we
enter
for
a
while
into
this
divine
life
and
share
the
happiness
of
god
but
that
is
a
theme
for
our
chapter
on
the
it
is
a
far
cry
from
this
conception
of
a
god
untroubled
by
care
for
a
world
to
which
he
is
only
related
as
the
object
of
its
aspiration
to
the
god
who
cares
even
for
the
fall
of
the
sparrow
and
of
whom
it
is
written
deus
dilexit
but
it
was
the
standing
task
of
the
philosophical
theologians
of
the
middle
ages
to
fuse
the
two
conceptions
plato
s
god
who
if
not
quite
the
creator
is
the
father
and
fashioner
of
us
all
and
keeps
providential
watch
over
the
world
he
has
fashioned
would
have
lent
himself
better
to
their
purposes
but
plato
was
held
by
the
mediæval
church
to
have
denied
the
resurrection
of
the
body
the
combination
of
aristotle
s
theism
with
the
theism
of
early
christianity
was
effected
by
exquisitely
subtle
logical
devices
but
even
in
thomas
one
can
not
help
seeing
the
seams
nor
can
one
help
seeing
in
aristotle
s
own
doctrine
the
usual
want
of
coherence
between
an
initial
bias
and
a
final
reversion
to
the
very
platonic
positions
aristotle
is
fond
of
impugning
we
are
told
at
the
outset
that
the
platonic
separate
forms
are
empty
names
and
that
the
real
individual
thing
is
always
a
composite
of
matter
and
a
form
which
only
exists
in
matter
we
find
in
the
end
that
the
source
of
the
whole
process
by
which
matter
becomes
imbued
with
form
is
a
being
which
is
pure
form
and
stands
outside
the
whole
development
which
its
presence
sets
up
and
the
issue
of
aristotle
s
warning
against
poetic
metaphors
is
the
doctrine
that
god
moves
the
world
by
being
the
object
of
the
world
s
desire
there
is
no
part
of
aristotle
s
system
which
has
been
more
carefully
thought
out
than
his
physics
at
the
same
time
it
is
almost
wholly
on
account
of
his
physical
doctrines
that
his
long
ascendancy
over
thought
is
so
much
to
be
regretted
aristotle
s
qualifications
as
a
man
of
science
have
been
much
overrated
in
one
department
that
of
descriptive
natural
history
he
shows
himself
a
master
of
minute
and
careful
observation
who
could
obtain
unqualified
praise
from
so
great
a
naturalist
as
darwin
but
in
astronomy
and
physics
proper
his
inferiority
in
mathematical
thinking
and
his
dislike
for
mechanical
ways
of
explaining
facts
put
him
at
a
great
disadvantage
as
compared
with
plato
and
plato
s
pythagorean
friends
thus
his
authority
was
for
centuries
one
of
the
chief
influences
which
prevented
the
development
of
astronomy
on
right
lines
plato
had
himself
both
taught
the
mobility
of
the
earth
and
denied
correctly
that
the
earth
is
at
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
the
copernican
hypothesis
in
astronomy
probably
originated
in
the
academy
aristotle
however
insists
on
the
central
position
of
the
earth
and
violently
attacks
plato
for
believing
in
its
motion
it
is
equally
serious
that
he
insists
on
treating
the
four
elements
as
ultimately
unanalysable
forms
of
matter
though
plato
had
not
only
observed
that
so
far
from
being
the
abc
or
literally
letters
of
the
alphabet
of
nature
they
do
not
deserve
to
be
called
even
syllables
but
had
also
definitely
put
forward
the
view
that
it
is
the
geometrical
structure
of
the
corpuscles
of
body
upon
which
sensible
qualities
depend
it
is
on
this
doctrine
of
course
that
all
mathematical
physics
rests
aristotle
reverts
to
the
older
theory
that
the
differences
between
one
element
and
another
are
qualitative
differences
of
a
sensible
kind
even
in
the
biological
sciences
aristotle
shows
an
unfortunate
proneness
to
disregard
established
fact
when
it
conflicts
with
the
theories
for
which
he
has
a
personal
liking
thus
though
the
importance
of
the
brain
as
the
central
organ
of
the
system
had
been
discovered
in
the
late
sixth
or
early
fifth
century
by
the
physician
alemacon
of
crotona
and
taught
by
the
great
hippocrates
in
the
fifth
and
by
plato
in
the
fourth
century
aristotle
s
prejudices
in
favour
of
the
doctrines
of
a
different
school
of
biologists
led
him
to
revert
to
the
view
that
it
is
the
heart
which
is
the
centre
of
what
we
now
call
the
nervous
system
it
is
mainly
on
account
of
these
reactionary
scientific
views
that
he
was
attacked
in
the
early
seventeenth
century
by
writers
like
our
own
francis
bacon
who
found
in
veneration
for
aristotle
one
of
the
chief
hindrances
to
the
free
development
of
natural
science
the
same
complaints
had
been
made
long
before
by
critics
belonging
to
the
platonic
academy
it
is
a
platonist
of
the
time
of
marcus
aurelius
who
sums
up
a
vigorous
attack
on
the
aristotelian
astronomy
by
the
remark
that
aristotle
never
understood
that
the
true
task
of
the
physicist
is
not
to
prescribe
laws
to
nature
but
to
learn
from
observation
of
the
facts
what
the
laws
followed
by
nature
are
in
determining
the
scope
of
physics
we
have
to
begin
by
considering
what
is
the
special
characteristic
of
things
produced
by
nature
as
contrasted
with
those
produced
by
art
the
obvious
distinction
intimated
by
the
very
etymology
of
the
word
nature
connected
with
to
grow
to
be
born
as
is
with
is
that
what
is
by
nature
is
born
and
grows
whereas
what
is
as
a
result
of
artifice
is
the
natural
may
thus
be
said
to
consist
of
living
bodies
and
of
their
constituent
parts
hence
inorganic
matter
also
is
included
in
nature
on
the
ground
that
living
tissue
can
be
analysed
back
into
compounds
of
the
elements
now
things
which
are
alive
and
grow
are
distinguished
from
things
which
are
made
by
a
source
of
motion
and
quiescence
within
themselves
all
of
them
exhibit
motions
changes
of
quality
processes
of
growth
and
decline
which
are
initiated
from
within
hence
nature
may
be
defined
as
the
totality
of
things
which
have
a
source
of
motion
internal
to
themselves
and
of
the
constituent
parts
of
such
things
nature
then
comprises
all
beings
capable
of
spontaneous
change
whatever
either
does
not
change
at
all
or
only
changes
in
consequence
of
external
influences
is
excluded
from
nature
thus
the
fundamental
fact
everywhere
present
in
nature
is
change
process
motion
since
motion
in
the
literal
sense
of
change
of
position
is
involved
as
a
condition
of
every
such
process
and
such
motion
requires
space
through
which
to
move
and
time
to
move
in
the
doctrine
of
space
and
time
will
also
form
part
of
physics
hence
a
great
part
of
aristotle
s
special
lectures
on
physics
is
occupied
with
discussion
of
the
nature
of
space
and
time
and
of
the
continuity
which
we
must
ascribe
to
them
if
the
continuous
motion
on
which
the
unbroken
life
of
the
universe
depends
is
to
be
real
aristotle
knows
nothing
of
the
modern
questions
whether
space
and
time
are
real
or
only
phenomenal
whether
they
are
objective
or
subjective
just
as
he
simply
assumes
that
bodies
are
things
that
really
exist
whether
we
happen
to
perceive
them
or
not
so
he
assumes
that
the
space
and
time
in
which
they
move
are
real
features
of
a
world
that
does
not
depend
for
its
existence
on
our
perceiving
it
his
treatment
of
space
is
singularly
he
conceives
it
as
a
sort
of
vessel
into
which
you
can
pour
different
liquids
just
as
the
same
pot
may
hold
first
wine
and
then
water
so
if
you
can
say
there
was
water
here
but
now
there
is
air
here
this
implies
the
existence
of
a
receptacle
which
once
held
the
water
but
now
holds
the
air
hence
a
jug
or
pot
may
be
called
a
place
that
can
be
carried
about
and
space
or
place
may
be
called
an
immovable
vessel
hence
the
place
of
a
thing
may
be
defined
as
the
boundary
or
inner
surface
of
the
body
which
immediately
surrounds
the
thing
it
follows
from
this
that
there
can
be
no
empty
space
in
the
last
resort
absolute
space
is
the
actual
surface
of
the
outermost
heaven
which
contains
everything
else
in
itself
but
is
not
contained
in
any
remoter
body
thus
all
things
whatever
are
in
this
heaven
but
it
is
not
itself
in
anything
else
in
accord
with
the
standing
greek
identification
of
determinate
character
with
limitation
aristotle
holds
that
this
outermost
heaven
must
be
at
a
limited
distance
from
us
actual
space
is
thus
finite
in
the
sense
that
the
volume
of
the
universe
could
be
expressed
as
a
finite
number
of
cubic
miles
or
yards
though
since
it
must
be
continuous
it
is
infinitely
divisible
however
often
you
subdivide
a
length
an
area
or
a
volume
you
will
always
be
dividing
it
into
lesser
lengths
which
can
once
more
be
divided
you
will
never
by
division
come
to
points
mere
positions
without
magnitude
of
divisibility
the
treatment
of
time
is
more
thoughtful
time
is
inseparably
connected
with
movement
or
change
we
only
perceive
that
time
has
elapsed
when
we
perceive
that
change
has
occurred
but
time
is
not
the
same
as
change
for
change
is
of
different
and
incommensurate
kinds
change
of
place
change
of
colour
but
to
take
up
time
is
common
to
all
these
forms
of
process
and
time
is
not
the
same
as
motion
for
there
are
different
rates
of
speed
but
the
very
fact
that
we
can
compare
these
different
velocities
implies
that
there
are
not
different
velocities
of
time
then
is
that
in
terms
of
which
we
motion
the
number
of
motion
in
respect
of
before
and
after
it
is
that
by
which
we
estimate
the
of
processes
thus
when
we
speak
of
minutes
days
months
as
required
for
a
certain
process
to
be
completed
we
are
counting
something
this
something
is
time
it
does
not
seem
to
occur
to
aristotle
that
this
definition
implies
that
there
are
indivisible
bits
of
time
though
he
quite
correctly
states
the
incompatible
proposition
that
time
is
made
up
of
successive
moments
which
have
no
duration
at
all
and
can
no
more
be
counted
than
the
points
on
a
straight
line
he
recognises
of
course
that
the
continuity
of
motion
implies
that
of
time
as
well
as
of
space
since
however
continuity
in
his
language
means
the
same
thing
as
indefinite
divisibility
it
ought
not
to
be
possible
for
him
to
regard
time
as
made
up
of
time
like
linear
extension
ought
for
him
to
be
a
length
of
something
continuous
motion
and
the
spheres
the
continuous
depends
upon
a
continuous
movement
set
up
in
the
universe
as
a
whole
by
the
presence
of
an
everlasting
and
unchangeable
first
mover
god
from
the
of
god
it
follows
that
this
most
universal
of
movements
must
be
absolutely
uniform
of
what
precise
kind
can
such
a
movement
be
as
the
source
of
the
movement
is
one
and
the
object
moved
is
also
one
viz
the
compass
of
the
heaven
the
movement
of
the
or
first
moved
the
object
immediately
stimulated
to
motion
by
god
s
presence
to
it
must
be
mechanically
simple
now
aristotle
mistakenly
held
that
there
are
two
forms
of
movement
which
are
simple
and
unanalysable
motion
of
translation
along
a
straight
line
and
motion
of
rotation
round
an
axis
he
is
at
pains
to
argue
that
rectilinear
motion
which
we
easily
discover
to
be
that
characteristic
of
bodies
near
the
earth
s
surface
when
left
to
themselves
can
not
be
the
kind
of
movement
which
belongs
to
the
heaven
as
a
whole
for
continuous
rectilinear
movement
in
the
same
direction
could
not
go
on
for
ever
on
his
assumption
that
there
is
no
space
outside
the
heaven
which
is
itself
at
a
finite
distance
from
us
and
motion
to
and
fro
would
not
be
unbroken
since
aristotle
argues
that
every
time
a
moving
body
reached
the
end
of
its
path
and
the
sense
of
its
movement
was
reversed
it
would
be
for
two
consecutive
moments
in
the
same
place
and
therefore
at
rest
reversal
of
sense
would
imply
a
discontinuity
hence
he
decides
that
the
primary
unbroken
movement
must
be
the
rotation
of
the
first
moved
that
is
the
heaven
containing
the
fixed
stars
round
its
axis
this
is
the
only
movement
which
could
go
on
for
ever
at
a
uniform
rate
and
in
the
same
sense
starting
with
the
conviction
that
the
earth
is
at
rest
in
the
centre
of
the
universe
he
inevitably
accounts
for
the
alternation
of
day
and
night
as
the
effect
of
such
a
revolution
of
the
whole
universe
round
an
axis
passing
through
the
centre
of
the
earth
the
universe
is
thus
thought
of
as
bounded
by
a
spherical
surface
on
the
concave
side
of
which
are
the
fixed
stars
which
are
therefore
one
and
all
at
the
same
distance
from
us
this
sphere
under
the
immediate
influence
of
god
revolves
on
its
axis
once
in
hours
and
this
period
of
revolution
is
absolutely
uniform
next
the
apparently
irregular
paths
of
the
planets
known
to
aristotle
the
moon
mercury
venus
the
sun
mars
jupiter
saturn
are
resolved
into
combinations
of
similar
uniform
rotations
each
planet
having
as
many
spheres
assigned
to
it
as
are
requisite
for
the
analysis
of
its
apparent
path
into
perfectly
circular
elementary
motions
altogether
aristotle
holds
that
such
rotating
spheres
are
required
over
and
above
the
first
moved
itself
whose
rotation
is
of
course
communicated
to
all
the
lesser
spheres
included
within
it
as
in
the
case
of
the
first
moved
the
uniform
unceasing
rotation
of
each
sphere
is
explained
by
the
influence
on
it
of
an
unchanging
immaterial
form
which
is
to
its
own
sphere
what
god
is
to
the
universe
as
a
whole
in
the
aristotelianism
of
the
mediæval
church
these
pure
forms
or
intelligences
which
originate
the
movements
of
the
various
planetary
spheres
are
naturally
identified
with
angels
it
is
to
the
angelic
intelligences
which
move
the
heaven
of
venus
which
comes
third
in
order
counting
outward
from
the
earth
that
dante
addresses
his
famous
canzone
ch
intendendo
il
terzo
del
the
mediæval
astronomy
however
differs
in
two
important
respects
from
that
of
aristotle
himself
the
number
of
spheres
is
different
increasing
knowledge
of
the
complexity
of
the
paths
of
the
planets
showed
that
if
their
paths
are
to
be
analysed
into
combinations
of
circular
motions
such
rotations
must
be
an
altogether
inadequate
number
aristotle
s
method
of
analysis
of
the
heavenly
movements
was
therefore
combined
with
either
or
both
of
two
others
originated
by
pure
astronomers
who
sat
loose
to
metaphysics
one
of
these
methods
was
to
account
for
a
planet
s
path
by
the
introduction
of
the
planet
was
thought
of
not
as
fixed
at
a
given
point
on
its
principal
sphere
but
as
situated
on
the
circumference
of
a
lesser
sphere
which
has
its
centre
at
a
fixed
point
of
the
principal
sphere
and
rotates
around
an
axis
passing
through
this
centre
if
need
were
this
type
of
hypothesis
could
be
further
complicated
by
imagining
any
number
of
such
epicycles
within
epicycles
the
other
method
was
the
employment
of
eccentrics
circular
movements
which
are
described
not
about
the
common
centre
of
the
earth
and
the
universe
but
about
some
point
in
its
neighbourhood
by
combinations
of
epicycles
and
eccentrics
the
mediæval
astronomers
contrived
to
reduce
the
number
of
principal
spheres
to
for
each
planet
the
arrangement
we
find
in
dante
also
real
or
supposed
astronomical
perturbations
unknown
to
aristotle
led
some
mediæval
theorists
to
follow
the
scheme
devised
by
alphonso
the
wise
of
castille
in
which
further
spheres
are
inserted
between
that
of
saturn
the
outermost
planet
and
the
first
moved
in
dante
we
have
excluding
the
empyrean
or
immovable
heaven
where
god
and
the
blessed
are
nine
spheres
one
for
each
of
the
planets
one
for
the
fixed
stars
and
one
for
the
first
moved
which
is
now
distinguished
from
the
heaven
of
the
stars
in
milton
who
adopts
the
alphonsine
scheme
we
have
further
a
sphere
called
the
second
movable
or
crystalline
introduced
between
the
heaven
of
the
fixed
stars
and
the
first
moved
to
account
for
the
imaginary
phenomenon
of
trepidation
in
reading
dante
shakespeare
and
milton
we
have
always
to
remember
that
none
of
these
reproduces
the
aristotelian
doctrine
of
the
spheres
accurately
their
astronomy
is
an
amalgam
of
aristotle
ptolemy
and
hipparchus
iii
they
pass
the
planets
seven
and
pass
the
fixed
and
that
crystalline
sphere
whose
balance
weighs
the
trepidation
talked
and
that
first
moved
so
far
the
doctrine
of
the
spheres
might
be
no
more
than
a
legitimate
mathematical
fiction
a
convenient
device
for
analysing
the
complicated
apparent
movements
of
the
heavenly
bodies
into
circular
components
this
was
originally
the
part
played
by
spheres
in
ancient
astronomical
theory
and
it
is
worth
while
to
be
quite
clear
about
the
fact
as
there
is
a
mistaken
impression
widely
current
that
aristotle
s
astronomy
is
typical
of
greek
views
in
general
the
truth
is
that
it
is
peculiar
to
himself
the
origin
of
the
theory
was
academic
plato
proposed
to
the
academy
as
a
subject
of
inquiry
to
devise
such
a
mathematical
analysis
of
astronomical
motions
as
will
best
save
the
appearances
will
most
simply
account
for
the
apparent
paths
of
the
planets
the
analysis
of
these
paths
into
resultants
of
several
rotations
was
offered
as
a
solution
by
the
astronomer
eudoxus
of
cnidus
so
far
the
spheres
then
were
a
mere
mathematical
hypothesis
what
aristotle
did
and
it
is
perhaps
the
most
retrograde
step
ever
taken
in
the
history
of
a
science
was
to
convert
the
mathematical
hypothesis
into
physical
fact
the
spheres
become
with
him
real
bodies
and
as
none
of
the
bodies
we
are
familiar
with
exhibit
any
tendency
to
rotate
in
circles
when
left
to
themselves
aristotle
was
forced
to
introduce
into
physics
the
disastrous
theory
which
it
was
a
great
part
of
galileo
s
to
destroy
that
the
stuff
of
which
the
spheres
are
made
is
a
fifth
body
different
from
the
elements
of
which
the
bodies
among
which
we
live
are
made
hence
he
makes
an
absolute
distinction
between
two
kinds
of
matter
celestial
matter
the
fifth
body
and
terrestrial
or
elementary
matter
the
fundamental
difference
is
that
terrestrial
or
elementary
matter
left
to
itself
follows
a
rectilinear
path
celestial
matter
rotates
but
it
is
further
inferred
from
the
supposed
absolute
uniformity
of
the
celestial
movements
that
celestial
matter
is
simple
uncompounded
incapable
of
change
and
consequently
that
no
new
state
of
things
can
ever
arise
in
the
heavens
the
spheres
and
planets
have
always
been
and
will
always
be
exactly
as
they
are
at
the
present
moment
mutability
is
confined
to
the
region
of
terrestrial
or
elementary
matter
which
only
extends
as
far
as
the
orbit
of
the
moon
the
lowest
of
the
celestial
bodies
because
it
is
only
terrestrial
things
which
are
as
we
should
say
chemical
compounds
this
is
the
doctrine
which
galileo
has
in
mind
when
he
dwells
on
such
astronomical
facts
as
the
existence
of
and
variable
stars
and
the
signs
of
irregularity
presented
by
the
moon
s
surface
the
distinction
is
peculiar
to
aristotle
no
one
before
him
had
ever
thought
of
supposing
the
heavenly
bodies
to
be
made
of
any
materials
other
than
those
of
which
bodies
terrestrial
are
made
in
the
academic
attack
on
aristotle
s
science
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
the
two
points
singled
out
for
reprobation
are
his
rejection
of
the
principle
that
all
moving
bodies
left
to
themselves
follow
a
rectilinear
path
and
his
denial
that
the
heavenly
bodies
are
made
of
the
same
elements
as
everything
else
it
may
just
be
mentioned
in
passing
that
our
word
gets
its
sense
from
the
supposed
special
nobility
of
the
incorruptible
fifth
body
as
we
have
seen
already
aristotle
was
out
of
sympathy
with
the
tendency
to
regard
the
sensible
differences
between
bodies
as
consequences
of
more
ultimate
differences
in
the
geometrical
structure
of
their
particles
hence
his
whole
attitude
towards
the
problems
of
that
branch
of
natural
science
which
we
call
physics
is
quite
unlike
any
view
to
which
we
are
accustomed
he
reverts
from
the
mathematical
lines
of
thought
current
in
plato
s
academy
to
the
type
of
view
more
natural
to
the
plain
man
and
like
the
earliest
men
of
science
regards
the
differences
which
our
senses
apprehend
as
fundamental
among
these
particular
stress
is
laid
on
the
difference
in
sensible
temperature
the
hot
the
cold
in
saturation
the
dry
the
moist
and
in
density
the
dense
the
rare
if
we
consider
the
first
two
of
these
oppositions
we
can
make
four
binary
combinations
of
the
elementary
opposite
characters
viz
hot
and
dry
hot
and
moist
cold
and
moist
cold
and
dry
these
combinations
are
regarded
as
corresponding
respectively
to
the
sensible
characteristics
of
the
four
bodies
which
empedocles
the
father
of
greek
chemistry
had
treated
as
the
ultimate
components
of
everything
fire
is
hot
and
dry
air
hot
and
moist
water
moist
and
cold
earth
cold
and
dry
this
reflection
shows
us
why
aristotle
held
that
the
most
rudimentary
form
in
which
matter
ever
actually
exists
is
that
of
one
of
these
elements
each
of
them
has
quality
in
common
with
another
and
it
is
in
virtue
of
this
that
a
portion
of
one
element
can
be
assimilated
by
and
transmuted
into
another
a
process
which
seems
to
the
untutored
eye
to
be
constantly
recurring
in
nature
we
also
observe
that
the
order
in
which
the
elements
appear
when
so
arranged
as
to
form
a
series
in
which
each
term
has
one
quality
in
common
with
each
of
its
neighbours
is
also
that
of
their
increasing
density
this
would
help
to
make
the
conception
of
their
transmutability
all
the
more
natural
as
it
suggests
that
the
process
may
be
effected
by
steady
condensation
we
must
remember
carefully
that
for
aristotle
who
denies
the
possibility
of
a
vacuum
as
for
the
mediæval
alchemists
condensation
does
not
mean
a
mere
diminution
of
the
distances
between
corpuscles
which
remain
unchanged
in
character
but
is
a
process
of
real
qualitative
change
in
the
body
which
undergoes
it
incidentally
we
may
remark
that
changes
of
quality
are
regarded
by
aristotle
as
stages
in
a
continuous
movement
from
one
extreme
of
a
scale
to
another
for
example
colours
with
him
as
with
goethe
form
a
series
of
which
the
opposites
white
and
black
are
the
every
other
colour
is
a
combination
of
white
and
black
according
to
a
definite
proportion
the
aristotelian
doctrine
of
weight
was
one
of
the
chief
obstacles
which
science
had
to
contend
with
in
establishing
correct
notions
in
dynamics
it
is
a
curious
feature
of
greek
science
before
aristotle
that
though
the
facts
connected
with
gravity
were
well
known
no
one
introduced
the
notion
of
weight
to
account
for
them
the
difference
between
heavy
bodies
and
light
bodies
had
been
previously
treated
as
secondary
for
science
plato
s
treatment
of
the
matter
is
typical
of
the
best
science
we
must
not
try
to
explain
why
the
heavier
bodies
tend
to
move
towards
the
earth
s
surface
by
saying
that
they
have
a
downward
motion
their
motion
is
not
downward
but
towards
the
centre
the
earth
though
not
fixed
at
the
centre
of
the
universe
being
nearer
to
it
than
the
rest
of
the
solar
and
sidereal
system
plato
then
explains
the
tendency
in
virtue
of
which
the
heavier
bodies
move
towards
the
centre
as
an
attraction
of
like
for
like
the
universal
tendency
is
for
smaller
masses
of
earth
water
air
fire
to
be
attracted
towards
the
great
aggregations
of
the
same
materials
this
is
far
from
being
a
satisfactory
theory
in
the
light
of
facts
which
were
not
yet
known
to
plato
but
it
is
on
the
right
lines
it
starts
from
the
conception
of
the
facts
of
gravity
as
due
to
an
attractive
force
of
some
kind
and
it
has
the
great
merit
of
bringing
the
sinking
of
stones
and
the
rising
of
vapours
under
the
same
explanation
aristotle
though
retaining
the
central
idea
that
a
body
tends
to
move
towards
the
region
where
the
great
cosmic
mass
of
the
same
kind
is
congregated
introduced
the
entirely
incompatible
notion
of
an
absolute
distinction
of
up
and
down
he
identified
the
centre
of
the
universe
with
that
of
the
earth
and
looked
on
motion
to
this
centre
as
downward
this
led
him
to
make
a
distinction
between
heavy
bodies
which
naturally
tend
to
move
down
and
light
bodies
which
tend
to
move
up
away
from
the
centre
the
doctrine
works
out
thus
the
heaviest
elements
tend
to
be
massed
together
nearest
the
centre
the
lightest
to
be
furthest
from
it
each
element
thus
has
its
proper
place
that
of
water
being
immediately
above
earth
that
of
air
next
and
that
of
fire
furthest
from
the
centre
and
nearest
to
the
regions
occupied
by
celestial
matter
readers
of
dante
will
recollect
the
ascent
from
the
earthly
paradise
through
the
sphere
of
fire
with
which
the
opens
in
its
own
proper
region
no
body
is
heavy
or
light
as
we
should
say
any
fluid
loses
its
weight
when
immersed
in
itself
when
a
portion
of
an
element
is
out
of
its
own
region
and
surrounded
by
the
great
cosmic
aggregate
of
another
element
either
of
two
cases
may
occur
the
body
which
is
out
of
its
element
may
be
its
proper
place
in
which
case
it
is
light
and
tends
to
move
perpendicularly
upwards
to
its
place
or
it
may
be
its
proper
place
and
then
it
is
heavy
and
tends
to
move
perpendicularly
down
until
it
reaches
its
place
it
was
this
supposed
real
distinction
between
motion
up
and
motion
down
which
made
it
so
hard
for
the
contemporaries
of
galileo
to
understand
that
an
inflated
bladder
rises
for
the
same
reason
that
a
stone
sinks
of
aristotle
s
biology
reasons
of
space
forbid
us
to
say
much
here
but
a
remark
or
two
may
be
made
about
his
theory
of
reproduction
since
it
is
constantly
referred
to
in
much
modern
literature
and
has
also
played
its
part
in
theology
an
interesting
point
is
the
distinction
between
perfect
and
imperfect
animals
perfect
animals
are
those
which
can
only
be
reproduced
sexually
aristotle
held
however
that
there
are
some
creatures
even
among
vertebrates
which
be
produced
by
the
vivifying
effect
of
solar
heat
on
decomposing
matter
without
any
parents
at
all
thus
malobservation
of
the
facts
of
putrefaction
led
to
the
belief
that
flies
and
worms
are
engendered
by
heat
from
decaying
bodies
and
it
was
even
thought
that
frogs
and
mice
are
produced
in
the
same
way
from
in
this
process
the
aequivocal
generation
solar
heat
was
conceived
as
the
operative
efficient
cause
which
leads
to
the
realisation
of
an
organic
form
in
the
decaying
matter
in
sexual
reproduction
aristotle
regards
the
male
parent
as
the
agent
or
efficient
cause
which
contributes
the
element
of
form
and
organisation
to
the
offspring
the
female
parent
supplies
only
the
raw
material
of
the
new
creature
but
she
supplies
the
whole
of
this
no
is
supplied
by
the
male
parent
to
the
body
of
the
offspring
a
theory
which
thomas
found
useful
in
defending
the
dogma
of
the
virgin
birth
since
the
mind
grows
and
develops
it
comes
under
the
class
of
things
which
have
a
source
of
motion
internal
to
themselves
and
psychology
is
therefore
for
aristotle
a
branch
of
physics
to
understand
his
treatment
of
psychological
questions
we
need
bear
two
things
in
mind
or
soul
means
in
greek
more
than
consciousness
does
to
us
consciousness
is
a
relatively
late
and
highly
developed
manifestation
of
the
principle
which
the
greeks
call
soul
that
principle
shows
itself
not
merely
in
consciousness
but
in
the
whole
process
of
nutrition
and
growth
and
the
adaptation
of
motor
response
to
an
external
situation
thus
consciousness
is
a
more
secondary
feature
of
the
soul
in
greek
philosophy
than
in
most
modern
thought
which
has
never
ceased
to
be
affected
by
descartes
selection
of
thought
as
the
special
characteristic
of
psychical
life
in
common
language
the
word
is
constantly
used
where
we
should
say
life
rather
than
soul
and
in
greek
philosophy
a
work
on
the
means
what
we
should
call
one
on
the
principle
of
life
it
is
a
consequence
of
this
way
of
thinking
of
the
soul
that
the
process
of
bodily
and
mental
development
is
regarded
by
aristotle
as
one
single
continuous
process
the
growth
of
a
man
s
intellect
and
character
by
which
he
becomes
a
thinker
and
a
citizen
is
a
continuation
of
the
process
by
which
his
body
is
conceived
and
born
and
passes
into
physical
manhood
this
comes
out
in
the
words
of
the
definition
of
the
soul
the
soul
is
the
first
entelechy
or
actual
realisation
of
a
natural
organic
body
what
this
means
is
that
the
soul
stands
to
the
living
body
as
all
form
realised
in
matter
does
to
the
matter
of
which
it
is
the
form
or
that
the
soul
is
the
form
of
the
body
what
the
organic
body
is
to
the
embryo
out
of
which
it
has
grown
that
soul
is
to
the
body
itself
as
the
embryo
grows
into
the
actual
living
body
so
the
living
body
grows
into
a
body
exhibiting
the
actual
directing
presence
of
mind
aristotle
illustrates
the
relation
by
the
remark
that
if
the
whole
body
was
one
vast
eye
seeing
would
be
its
soul
as
the
eye
is
a
tool
for
seeing
with
but
a
living
tool
which
is
part
of
ourselves
so
the
body
is
a
like
tool
or
instrument
for
living
with
hence
we
may
say
of
the
soul
that
it
is
the
end
of
the
body
the
activity
to
which
the
body
is
instrumental
as
seeing
is
the
end
to
which
the
eye
is
instrumental
but
we
must
note
that
the
soul
is
called
only
the
first
or
initial
entelechy
of
the
body
the
reason
is
that
the
mere
presence
of
the
soul
does
not
guarantee
the
full
living
of
the
life
to
which
our
body
is
but
the
instrument
if
we
are
to
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
we
must
not
merely
have
a
soul
we
have
it
even
in
sleep
in
ignorance
in
folly
the
soul
itself
needs
further
to
be
educated
and
trained
in
intelligence
and
character
and
to
exercise
its
intelligence
and
character
efficiently
on
the
problems
of
thought
and
life
the
mere
presence
of
soul
is
only
a
first
step
in
the
progress
towards
fullness
of
life
this
is
why
aristotle
calls
the
soul
the
entelechy
of
the
living
body
the
full
and
final
entelechy
is
the
life
of
intelligence
and
character
actively
functioning
from
this
conception
of
the
soul
s
relation
to
the
body
we
see
that
aristotle
s
doctrine
of
body
and
mind
does
not
readily
fall
into
line
with
any
of
the
typical
theories
of
our
time
he
neither
thinks
of
the
soul
as
a
thing
acting
on
the
body
and
acted
on
by
it
nor
yet
as
a
series
of
states
of
mind
concomitant
with
certain
states
of
body
from
his
point
of
view
to
ask
whether
soul
and
body
interact
or
whether
they
exhibit
parallelism
would
be
much
the
same
thing
as
to
ask
whether
life
interacts
with
the
body
or
whether
there
is
a
parallelism
between
vital
processes
and
bodily
processes
we
must
not
ask
at
all
how
the
body
and
soul
are
united
they
are
one
thing
as
the
matter
and
the
form
of
a
copper
globe
are
one
thus
they
are
in
actual
fact
inseparable
the
soul
is
the
soul
of
its
body
and
the
body
the
body
of
its
soul
we
can
only
distinguish
them
by
logical
analysis
as
we
can
distinguish
the
copper
from
the
sphericity
in
the
copper
globe
of
psychical
if
we
consider
the
order
of
development
we
find
that
some
vital
activities
make
their
appearance
earlier
than
others
and
that
it
is
a
universal
law
that
the
more
highly
developed
activities
always
have
the
less
highly
developed
as
their
basis
and
precondition
though
the
less
highly
developed
may
exist
apart
from
the
more
highly
developed
so
we
may
arrange
vital
activities
in
general
in
an
ontogenetic
order
the
order
in
which
they
make
their
appearance
in
the
individual
s
development
aristotle
reckons
three
such
stages
the
nutritive
the
sensitive
and
the
intelligent
the
lowest
form
in
which
life
shows
itself
at
all
the
level
of
minimum
distinction
between
the
living
and
the
lifeless
is
the
power
to
take
in
nutriment
assimilate
it
and
grow
in
vegetables
the
development
is
arrested
at
this
point
with
the
animals
we
reach
the
next
highest
level
that
of
sensitive
life
for
all
animals
have
at
least
the
sense
of
touch
thus
they
all
show
and
it
is
a
consequence
of
this
that
they
exhibit
appetition
the
simplest
form
of
conation
and
the
rudiments
of
feeling
and
temper
for
what
has
sensations
can
also
feel
pleasure
and
pain
and
what
can
feel
pleasure
and
pain
can
desire
since
desire
is
only
appetition
of
what
is
pleasant
thus
in
the
animals
we
have
the
beginnings
of
cognition
conation
and
affective
and
emotional
life
in
general
and
aristotle
adds
that
locomotion
makes
its
appearance
at
this
level
animals
do
not
like
plants
have
to
trust
to
their
supply
of
nutriment
coming
to
them
they
can
go
to
it
the
third
level
that
of
intelligence
the
power
to
compare
calculate
and
reflect
and
to
order
one
s
life
by
conscious
rule
is
exhibited
by
man
what
distinguishes
life
at
this
level
from
mere
sensitive
life
is
on
the
intellectual
side
the
ability
to
cognise
universal
truths
on
the
conative
the
power
to
live
by
rule
instead
of
being
swayed
by
momentary
appetition
the
former
gives
us
the
possibility
of
science
the
latter
of
moral
excellence
dante
s
fatti
non
foste
a
viver
como
bruti
ma
per
seguir
virtute
e
conosoenza
life
manifests
itself
at
the
animal
level
on
the
cognitive
side
as
on
the
conative
as
appetition
or
desire
on
the
affective
as
feeling
of
pleasure
or
pain
and
in
such
simple
emotional
moods
as
temper
resentment
longing
aristotle
gives
sensation
a
logical
priority
over
the
conative
and
emotional
expression
of
animal
life
to
experience
appetition
or
anger
or
desire
you
must
have
an
object
which
you
crave
for
or
desire
or
are
angry
with
and
it
is
only
when
you
have
reached
the
level
of
presentations
through
the
senses
that
you
can
be
said
to
have
an
object
appetition
or
temper
is
as
real
a
fact
as
perception
but
you
can
not
crave
for
or
feel
angry
with
a
thing
you
do
not
apprehend
aristotle
s
definition
of
sense
perception
is
that
it
is
a
capacity
for
discerning
or
distinguishing
between
the
sensible
qualities
of
things
his
conception
of
the
process
by
which
the
discernment
or
distinguishing
is
effected
is
not
altogether
happy
in
the
soul
takes
into
itself
the
of
the
thing
perceived
without
its
as
receives
the
shape
of
an
iron
without
the
iron
to
understand
this
we
have
to
remember
that
for
aristotle
the
sensible
qualities
of
the
external
world
colour
tones
tastes
and
the
rest
are
not
effects
of
mechanical
stimulation
of
our
but
real
qualities
of
bodies
the
hardness
of
iron
the
redness
of
a
piece
of
red
wax
are
all
primarily
in
the
iron
or
the
wax
they
are
forms
or
determinations
by
definite
law
of
the
matter
of
the
iron
or
the
wax
this
will
become
clearer
if
we
consider
a
definite
example
the
red
colour
of
the
wax
in
the
wax
the
red
colour
is
a
definite
combination
of
the
white
and
black
according
to
a
fixed
ratio
now
aristotle
s
view
of
the
process
of
is
that
when
i
become
aware
of
the
red
colour
the
same
proportion
of
white
to
black
which
makes
the
wax
red
is
reproduced
in
my
organ
of
vision
my
eye
while
i
am
seeing
the
red
assimilated
to
the
wax
is
itself
for
the
time
actually
reddened
but
it
does
not
become
wax
because
the
red
thing
i
am
looking
at
is
a
piece
of
red
wax
the
eye
remains
a
thing
composed
of
living
tissues
this
is
what
is
meant
by
saying
that
in
seeing
the
colours
of
things
the
eye
receives
forms
without
the
matter
of
the
things
in
which
those
forms
are
exhibited
thus
the
process
of
is
one
in
which
the
organ
of
sense
is
temporarily
assimilated
to
the
thing
apprehended
in
respect
of
the
particular
quality
cognised
by
that
organ
but
in
respect
of
no
other
according
to
aristotle
this
process
of
assimilation
always
requires
the
presence
of
a
medium
if
an
object
is
in
immediate
contact
with
the
eye
we
can
not
see
its
colour
if
it
is
too
near
the
ear
we
do
not
discern
the
note
it
gives
out
even
in
the
case
of
touch
and
taste
there
is
no
immediate
contact
between
the
object
perceived
and
the
true
organ
of
perception
for
in
touch
the
flesh
is
not
the
organ
of
apprehension
but
an
integument
surrounding
it
and
capable
of
acting
as
an
intermediary
between
it
and
things
thus
perception
is
always
accomplished
by
a
motion
set
up
in
the
medium
by
the
external
object
and
by
the
medium
in
our
aristotle
thus
contrives
to
bring
correct
apprehension
by
sense
of
the
qualities
of
things
under
the
formula
of
the
right
mean
or
right
proportion
which
is
better
known
from
the
use
made
of
it
in
the
philosopher
s
theory
of
conduct
the
colour
of
a
surface
the
pitch
of
the
note
given
out
by
a
vibrating
string
depend
on
and
vary
with
certain
forms
or
ratios
in
the
surface
or
the
vibrating
string
our
correct
apprehension
of
the
qualities
depends
on
the
reproduction
of
the
ratios
in
our
the
establishment
of
the
right
proportion
in
that
this
right
proportion
may
be
reproduced
in
our
own
it
is
necessary
that
the
medium
should
have
none
of
the
sensible
qualities
for
the
apprehension
whereof
it
serves
as
medium
the
medium
in
must
be
colourless
if
it
had
a
colour
of
its
own
the
motion
set
up
by
the
coloured
bodies
we
apprehend
would
not
be
transmitted
undistorted
to
our
organs
we
should
see
everything
through
a
coloured
haze
it
is
necessary
for
the
same
reason
that
the
percipient
organ
itself
when
in
a
state
of
quiescence
should
possess
none
of
the
qualities
which
can
be
induced
in
it
by
stimulation
the
upshot
of
the
whole
theory
is
that
the
is
potentially
what
the
it
apprehends
is
actually
actual
perceiving
is
just
that
special
transition
from
the
potential
to
the
actual
which
results
in
making
the
organ
for
the
time
being
of
the
same
quality
as
the
object
common
sensibles
and
the
common
every
sense
has
a
range
of
qualities
connected
with
it
as
its
special
objects
colours
can
only
be
perceived
by
the
eye
sounds
by
the
ear
and
so
forth
but
there
are
certain
characters
of
perceived
things
which
we
appear
to
apprehend
by
more
than
one
sense
thus
we
seem
to
perceive
size
and
shape
either
by
touch
or
by
sight
and
number
by
hearing
as
well
since
we
can
count
the
strokes
of
an
unseen
bell
hence
aristotle
distinguishes
between
the
special
sensible
qualities
such
as
colour
and
pitch
and
what
he
calls
the
common
sensibles
the
character
of
things
which
can
be
perceived
by
more
than
one
organ
these
are
enumerated
as
size
form
or
shape
number
motion
and
its
opposite
rest
being
the
addition
of
this
last
is
of
course
meant
to
account
for
our
conviction
that
any
perceived
colour
taste
or
other
quality
is
a
reality
and
not
a
delusion
the
list
corresponds
very
closely
with
one
given
by
plato
of
the
things
which
the
mind
perceives
herself
without
the
help
of
any
of
the
leading
determinations
of
sensible
things
which
are
due
not
to
sense
but
to
understanding
it
was
an
unfortunate
innovation
to
regard
the
discernment
of
number
or
movement
which
obviously
demand
intellectual
processes
such
as
counting
and
comparison
as
performed
immediately
by
sense
and
to
assign
the
apprehension
of
number
movement
figure
to
a
central
organ
this
organ
he
finds
in
the
heart
the
theory
is
that
when
the
special
organs
of
the
senses
are
stimulated
they
in
turn
communicate
movements
to
the
blood
and
animal
spirits
the
vapours
supposed
to
be
produced
from
the
blood
by
animal
heat
these
movements
are
propagated
inwards
to
the
heart
where
they
all
meet
this
is
supposed
to
account
for
the
important
fact
that
though
our
sensations
are
so
many
and
diverse
we
are
conscious
of
our
own
unity
as
the
subjects
apprehending
all
this
variety
the
unity
of
the
perceiving
subject
is
thus
made
to
depend
on
the
unity
of
the
ultimate
organ
of
sensation
the
heart
further
when
once
a
type
of
motion
has
been
set
up
in
any
at
the
periphery
of
the
body
it
will
be
propagated
inward
to
the
common
sensorium
in
the
heart
the
motions
set
up
by
stimulation
of
the
eye
and
of
the
skin
are
partly
different
partly
the
same
viz
in
so
far
as
they
are
determined
by
the
number
shape
size
movement
of
the
external
stimuli
hence
in
the
heart
itself
the
stimulation
on
which
perception
of
number
or
size
depends
is
one
and
the
same
whether
it
has
been
transmitted
from
the
eye
or
from
the
skin
awareness
of
lapse
of
time
is
also
regarded
as
a
function
of
the
common
since
it
is
the
common
sensory
which
perceives
motion
and
lapse
of
time
is
apprehended
only
in
the
apprehension
of
motion
thus
in
respect
of
the
inclusion
of
geometrical
form
and
lapse
of
time
among
the
common
sensibles
there
is
a
certain
resemblance
between
aristotle
s
doctrine
and
kant
s
theory
that
recognition
of
spatial
and
temporal
order
is
a
function
not
of
understanding
but
of
pure
sense
it
is
further
held
that
to
be
aware
that
one
is
perceiving
and
to
discriminate
between
the
different
classes
of
special
must
also
be
functions
of
the
common
thus
aristotle
makes
the
mistake
of
treating
the
most
fundamental
acts
of
intelligent
reflection
as
precisely
on
a
par
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
theory
of
knowledge
with
awareness
of
colour
or
sound
a
more
legitimate
function
assigned
to
the
common
sensorium
in
the
heart
is
that
fantasy
the
formation
of
mental
imagery
depends
on
its
activity
the
simplest
kind
of
image
the
pure
left
behind
after
the
object
directly
arousing
perception
has
ceased
to
stimulate
is
due
to
the
persistence
of
the
movements
set
up
in
the
heart
after
the
sensory
process
in
the
peripheral
organ
is
over
since
aristotle
denies
the
possibility
of
thinking
without
the
aid
of
this
function
of
the
common
sensorium
is
the
indispensable
basis
of
mental
recall
anticipation
and
thought
neither
experience
a
general
conviction
which
results
from
the
frequent
repetition
of
similar
perceptions
nor
thought
can
arise
in
any
animal
in
which
does
not
leave
such
traces
behind
it
similarly
free
imagery
the
existence
of
trains
of
imagination
not
tied
down
to
the
reproduction
of
an
actual
order
of
sensations
is
accounted
for
by
the
consideration
that
chance
coincidence
may
lead
to
the
stimulation
of
the
heart
in
the
same
way
in
which
it
might
have
been
stimulated
by
actual
sleeping
and
waking
and
the
experiences
of
are
likewise
due
to
changes
in
the
functioning
of
the
common
brought
about
partly
by
fatigue
in
the
superficial
partly
by
qualitative
changes
in
the
blood
and
animal
spirits
caused
by
the
processes
of
nutrition
and
digestion
probably
aristotle
s
best
scientific
work
in
psychology
is
contained
in
the
series
of
small
essays
in
which
this
theory
of
memory
and
its
imagery
is
worked
out
aristotle
s
language
about
the
common
sensibles
is
of
course
the
source
of
our
expression
common
sense
which
however
has
an
entirely
different
meaning
the
shifting
of
sense
has
apparently
been
effected
through
cicero
s
employment
of
the
phrase
to
mean
tactful
sympathy
the
feeling
of
fellowship
with
our
kind
on
which
the
stoic
philosophers
laid
so
much
stress
though
thinking
is
impossible
except
by
the
use
of
imagery
to
think
is
not
merely
to
possess
trains
of
imagery
or
even
to
be
aware
of
possessing
them
thinking
means
understanding
the
meaning
of
such
mental
imagery
and
arriving
through
the
understanding
at
knowledge
of
the
structure
of
the
real
world
how
this
process
of
interpreting
mental
imagery
and
reaching
valid
truth
is
achieved
with
greater
and
greater
success
until
it
culminates
in
the
apprehension
of
the
supreme
principles
of
philosophy
we
have
seen
in
dealing
with
the
aristotelian
theory
of
knowledge
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
physicist
who
is
concerned
with
thinking
simply
as
a
type
of
natural
process
the
relation
of
understanding
to
the
mental
imagery
just
described
is
analogous
to
that
of
sensation
to
sensible
qualities
the
objects
which
thinking
apprehends
are
the
universal
types
of
relation
by
which
the
world
of
things
is
pervaded
the
process
of
thinking
is
one
in
which
this
system
of
universal
relations
is
reproduced
by
way
of
idea
in
the
mind
of
the
thinker
the
understanding
thus
stands
to
its
objects
as
matter
to
form
the
process
of
getting
actually
to
understand
the
world
is
one
in
which
our
thought
or
understanding
steadily
receives
completer
determination
and
form
from
its
contemplation
of
reality
in
this
sense
the
process
is
one
in
which
the
understanding
may
be
said
to
be
passive
in
knowledge
it
is
passive
because
it
is
the
subject
which
at
every
fresh
stage
in
the
progress
to
knowledge
is
being
quite
literally
informed
by
the
action
of
the
real
world
through
the
sensation
and
imagery
hence
aristotle
says
that
in
order
that
the
understanding
may
be
correctly
informed
by
its
contact
with
its
objects
it
must
before
the
process
begins
have
no
determinate
character
of
its
own
it
must
be
simply
a
capacity
for
apprehending
the
types
of
interconnection
what
is
called
the
intelligence
i
mean
that
with
which
the
soul
thinks
and
understands
is
not
an
actual
thing
until
it
thinks
this
is
meant
to
exclude
any
doctrine
which
credits
the
understanding
with
either
of
its
own
such
as
innate
ideas
or
a
specific
of
its
own
if
the
results
of
our
thinking
arose
partly
from
the
structure
of
the
world
of
objects
and
partly
from
inherent
laws
of
the
structure
of
mind
our
thought
at
its
best
would
not
reproduce
the
universal
forms
or
types
of
interconnection
as
they
really
are
but
would
distort
them
as
the
shapes
of
things
are
distorted
when
we
see
them
through
a
lens
of
high
refractive
index
thus
though
aristotle
differs
from
the
modern
empiricists
in
holding
that
universals
realty
exist
in
things
and
are
the
links
of
connection
between
them
he
agrees
with
the
empiricist
that
knowledge
is
not
the
resultant
of
a
combination
of
facts
on
the
one
side
and
fundamental
laws
of
the
mind
s
working
on
the
other
at
the
outset
the
understanding
has
no
structure
it
develops
a
structure
for
itself
in
the
same
process
and
to
the
same
degree
in
which
it
apprehends
the
facts
hence
the
understanding
only
is
real
in
the
actual
process
of
understanding
its
objects
and
again
in
a
sense
the
understanding
and
the
things
it
understands
are
one
only
we
must
qualify
this
last
statement
by
saying
that
it
is
only
potentially
that
the
understanding
is
the
forms
which
it
apprehends
aristotle
does
not
mean
by
this
that
such
things
as
horses
and
oxen
are
thoughts
or
ideas
by
the
things
with
which
understanding
is
said
to
be
one
he
means
the
forms
which
we
apprehend
when
we
actually
understand
the
world
or
any
part
of
it
the
truths
of
science
his
point
then
is
that
the
actual
thinking
of
these
truths
and
the
truths
themselves
do
not
exist
apart
from
one
another
science
does
not
mean
certain
things
written
down
in
a
book
it
means
a
mind
engaged
in
thinking
and
knowing
things
and
of
the
mind
itself
considered
out
of
its
relation
to
the
actual
life
of
thinking
the
truths
of
science
we
can
say
no
more
than
that
it
is
a
name
for
the
fact
that
we
are
capable
of
achieving
such
thought
active
so
far
aristotle
s
account
of
thought
has
been
plain
sailing
thought
has
been
considered
as
the
final
and
highest
development
of
the
vital
functions
of
the
organism
and
hence
as
something
inseparable
from
the
lower
functions
of
nutrition
and
sensitive
life
the
existence
of
a
thought
which
is
not
a
function
of
a
living
body
and
which
is
not
passive
has
been
absolutely
excluded
but
at
this
point
we
are
suddenly
met
by
the
most
startling
of
all
the
inconsistencies
between
the
naturalistic
and
the
spiritualist
strains
in
aristotle
s
philosophy
in
a
few
broken
lines
he
tells
us
that
there
is
another
sense
of
the
word
thought
in
which
thought
actually
creates
the
truths
it
understands
just
as
light
may
be
said
to
make
the
colours
which
we
see
by
its
aid
and
intelligence
he
adds
is
separable
from
matter
and
impassive
and
unmixed
being
in
its
essential
nature
an
it
has
no
intermission
in
its
thinking
it
is
only
in
separation
from
matter
that
it
is
fully
itself
and
it
alone
is
immortal
and
everlasting
while
the
passive
intelligence
is
perishable
and
does
not
think
at
all
apart
from
this
the
meaning
of
this
is
not
made
clear
by
aristotle
himself
and
the
interpretation
was
disputed
even
among
the
philosopher
s
personal
disciples
one
important
attempt
to
clear
up
the
difficulty
is
that
made
by
alexander
of
aphrodisias
the
greatest
of
the
commentators
on
aristotle
in
the
second
century
alexander
said
as
aristotle
has
not
done
that
the
active
intelligence
is
numerically
the
same
in
all
men
and
is
identical
with
god
thus
all
that
is
specifically
human
in
each
of
us
is
the
passive
intelligence
or
capacity
for
being
enlightened
by
god
s
activity
upon
us
the
advantage
of
the
view
is
that
it
removes
the
active
intelligence
altogether
from
the
purview
of
psychology
which
then
becomes
a
purely
naturalistic
science
the
great
arabian
aristotelian
averroes
ibn
roschd
of
cordova
in
the
twelfth
century
went
still
further
in
the
direction
of
naturalism
since
the
active
and
passive
intelligence
can
only
be
separated
by
a
logical
abstraction
he
inferred
that
men
speaking
strictly
do
not
think
at
all
there
is
only
one
and
the
same
individual
intelligence
in
the
universe
and
all
that
we
call
our
thinking
is
really
not
ours
but
god
s
the
great
christian
scholastics
of
the
following
century
in
general
read
aristotle
through
the
eyes
of
averroes
commentator
as
thomas
calls
him
averrois
che
il
gran
commento
feo
as
dante
says
but
their
theology
compelled
them
to
disavow
his
doctrine
of
the
active
intelligence
against
which
they
could
also
bring
as
thomas
does
the
telling
argument
that
aristotle
could
never
have
meant
to
say
that
there
really
is
no
such
thing
as
human
intelligence
hence
arose
a
third
interpretation
the
thomist
according
to
which
the
active
intelligence
is
neither
god
nor
the
same
for
all
men
but
is
the
highest
and
most
rational
part
of
the
individual
human
soul
which
has
no
bodily
organ
hitherto
we
have
been
concerned
with
the
speculative
branches
of
knowledge
we
have
now
to
turn
to
practice
practice
too
is
an
activity
of
thought
but
an
activity
which
is
never
satisfied
by
the
process
of
thinking
itself
in
practice
our
thinking
is
always
directed
towards
the
production
of
some
result
other
than
true
thought
itself
as
in
engineering
it
is
not
enough
to
find
a
solution
of
the
problem
how
to
build
a
bridge
over
a
given
river
capable
of
sustaining
a
given
strain
so
in
directing
our
thought
on
the
problems
of
human
conduct
and
the
organisation
of
society
we
aim
at
something
more
than
the
understanding
of
human
life
in
the
one
case
what
we
aim
at
is
the
construction
of
the
bridge
in
the
other
it
is
the
production
of
goodness
in
ourselves
and
our
and
the
establishment
of
right
social
relations
in
the
state
aristotle
is
careful
to
insist
on
this
point
throughout
his
whole
treatment
of
moral
and
social
problems
the
principal
object
of
his
lectures
on
conduct
is
not
to
tell
his
hearers
what
goodness
is
but
to
make
them
good
and
similarly
it
is
quite
plain
that
was
intended
as
a
for
legislators
in
close
connection
with
this
practical
object
stands
his
theory
of
the
kind
of
truth
which
must
be
looked
for
in
ethics
and
politics
he
warns
us
against
expecting
precepts
which
have
the
exact
and
universal
rigidity
of
the
truths
of
speculative
science
practical
science
has
to
do
with
the
affairs
of
men
s
lives
matters
which
are
highly
complex
and
variable
in
a
word
with
what
may
be
otherwise
hence
we
must
be
content
if
we
can
lay
down
precepts
which
hold
good
in
the
main
just
as
in
medicine
we
do
not
expect
to
find
directions
which
will
effect
a
cure
in
all
cases
but
are
content
with
general
directions
which
require
to
be
adapted
to
special
cases
by
the
experience
and
judgment
of
the
practitioner
the
object
of
practical
science
then
is
to
formulate
rules
which
will
guide
us
in
obtaining
our
various
ends
now
when
we
consider
these
ends
we
see
at
once
that
some
are
subordinate
to
others
the
manufacture
of
may
be
the
end
at
which
their
maker
aims
but
it
is
to
the
military
man
a
mere
means
to
end
which
is
the
effective
use
of
them
successful
use
of
arms
is
again
the
end
of
the
professional
soldier
but
it
is
a
mere
means
among
others
to
the
statesman
further
it
is
the
military
men
who
use
the
arms
from
whom
the
manufacturer
has
to
take
his
directions
as
to
the
kind
of
arms
that
are
wanted
and
again
it
is
the
statesman
to
whom
the
professional
soldiers
have
to
look
for
directions
as
to
when
and
with
what
general
objects
in
view
they
shall
fight
so
the
art
which
uses
the
things
produced
by
another
art
is
the
superior
and
directing
art
the
art
which
makes
the
things
the
inferior
and
subordinate
art
hence
the
supreme
practical
art
is
politics
since
it
is
the
art
which
uses
the
products
turned
out
by
all
other
arts
as
means
to
its
ends
it
is
the
business
of
politics
the
art
of
the
statesman
to
prescribe
to
the
practitioners
of
all
other
arts
and
professions
the
lines
on
which
and
the
conditions
under
which
they
shall
exercise
their
vocation
with
a
view
to
securing
the
supreme
practical
end
the
of
the
community
among
the
other
professions
and
arts
which
make
the
materials
the
statesman
employs
the
profession
of
the
educator
stands
foremost
the
statesman
is
bound
to
demand
certain
qualities
of
mind
and
character
in
the
individual
citizens
the
production
of
these
mental
and
moral
qualities
must
therefore
be
the
work
of
the
educator
it
thus
becomes
an
important
branch
of
politics
to
specify
the
kind
of
mental
and
moral
qualities
which
a
statesman
should
require
the
educator
to
produce
in
his
pupils
it
is
this
branch
of
politics
which
aristotle
discusses
in
his
he
never
contemplates
a
study
of
the
individual
s
good
apart
from
politics
the
study
of
the
good
of
the
society
what
then
is
the
good
or
the
best
kind
of
life
for
an
individual
member
of
society
aristotle
answers
that
as
far
as
the
mere
name
is
concerned
there
is
a
general
agreement
to
call
the
best
life
happiness
but
the
real
problem
is
one
of
fact
what
kind
of
life
deserves
to
be
called
happiness
plato
had
laid
it
down
that
the
happy
life
must
satisfy
three
conditions
it
must
be
desirable
for
its
own
sake
it
must
be
sufficient
of
itself
to
satisfy
us
and
it
must
be
the
life
a
wise
man
would
prefer
to
any
other
the
question
is
what
general
formula
can
we
find
which
will
define
the
life
which
satisfies
these
conditions
to
find
the
answer
we
have
to
consider
what
plato
and
aristotle
call
the
work
or
function
of
man
by
the
work
of
anything
we
mean
what
can
only
be
done
by
it
or
by
it
better
than
by
anything
else
thus
the
work
of
the
eye
is
to
see
you
can
not
see
with
any
other
organ
and
when
the
eye
does
this
work
of
seeing
well
you
say
it
is
a
good
eye
so
we
may
say
of
any
living
being
that
its
work
is
to
live
and
that
it
is
a
good
being
when
it
does
this
work
of
living
efficiently
to
do
its
own
work
efficiently
is
the
excellence
or
virtue
of
the
thing
the
excellence
or
virtue
of
a
man
will
thus
be
to
live
efficiently
but
since
life
can
be
manifested
at
different
levels
if
we
would
know
what
man
s
work
is
we
must
ask
whether
there
is
not
some
form
of
life
which
can
be
lived
by
man
now
the
life
which
consists
in
merely
feeding
and
growing
belongs
to
all
organisms
and
can
be
lived
with
equal
vigour
by
them
all
there
is
however
a
kind
of
life
which
can
only
be
lived
by
man
the
life
which
consists
in
conscious
direction
of
one
s
actions
by
a
rule
it
is
the
work
of
man
to
live
this
kind
of
life
and
his
happiness
consists
in
living
it
efficiently
and
well
so
we
may
give
as
the
definition
of
human
that
it
is
an
active
life
in
accord
with
excellence
or
if
there
are
more
forms
of
excellence
than
one
in
accord
with
the
best
and
completest
of
them
and
we
must
add
in
a
complete
life
to
show
that
mere
promise
not
crowned
by
performance
does
not
suffice
to
entitle
man
s
life
to
be
called
happy
we
can
see
that
this
definition
satisfies
plato
s
three
conditions
a
vigorous
and
active
living
in
a
way
which
calls
into
play
the
specifically
human
capacities
of
man
is
desirable
for
its
own
sake
and
preferable
to
any
other
life
which
could
be
proposed
to
us
it
too
is
the
only
life
which
can
permanently
satisfy
men
but
we
must
add
that
if
such
a
life
is
to
be
lived
adequately
certain
advantages
of
fortune
must
be
presupposed
we
can
not
fully
live
a
life
of
this
kind
if
we
are
prevented
from
exercising
our
capacities
by
lack
of
means
or
health
or
friends
and
associates
and
even
the
calamities
which
arise
in
the
course
of
events
may
be
so
crushing
as
to
hinder
a
man
for
a
time
from
putting
forth
his
full
powers
these
external
good
things
are
not
constituents
of
happiness
but
merely
necessary
conditions
of
that
exercise
of
our
own
capacities
which
is
the
happy
life
in
our
definition
of
the
happy
life
we
said
that
it
was
one
of
activity
in
accord
with
goodness
or
excellence
and
we
left
it
an
open
question
whether
there
are
more
kinds
of
such
goodness
than
one
on
consideration
we
see
that
two
kinds
of
goodness
or
excellence
are
required
in
living
the
happy
life
the
happy
life
for
man
is
a
life
of
conscious
following
of
a
rule
to
live
it
well
then
you
need
to
know
what
the
right
rule
to
follow
is
and
you
need
also
to
follow
it
there
are
persons
who
deliberately
follow
a
wrong
rule
of
life
the
wicked
there
are
others
who
know
what
the
right
rule
is
but
fail
to
follow
it
because
their
tempers
and
appetites
are
unruly
the
morally
weak
to
live
the
happy
life
then
two
sorts
of
goodness
are
required
you
must
have
a
good
judgment
as
to
what
the
right
rule
is
or
if
you
can
not
find
it
out
for
yourself
you
must
at
least
be
able
to
recognise
it
when
it
is
laid
down
by
some
one
else
the
teacher
or
lawgiver
and
you
must
have
your
appetites
feelings
and
emotions
generally
so
trained
that
they
obey
the
rule
hence
excellence
goodness
or
virtue
is
divided
into
goodness
of
intellect
and
goodness
of
character
moral
goodness
the
word
being
used
for
the
complex
of
tempers
feelings
and
the
affective
side
of
human
nature
generally
in
education
goodness
of
character
has
to
be
produced
by
training
and
discipline
before
goodness
of
intellect
can
be
imparted
the
young
generally
have
to
be
trained
to
obey
the
right
rule
before
they
can
see
for
themselves
that
it
is
the
right
rule
and
if
a
man
s
tempers
and
passions
are
not
first
schooled
into
actual
obedience
to
the
rule
he
will
in
most
cases
never
see
that
it
is
the
right
rule
at
all
hence
aristotle
next
goes
on
to
discuss
the
general
character
of
the
kind
of
goodness
he
calls
goodness
of
character
the
right
state
of
the
feelings
and
passions
the
first
step
towards
understanding
what
goodness
of
character
is
is
to
consider
the
way
in
which
it
is
actually
produced
we
are
not
born
with
this
goodness
of
tempers
and
feelings
ready
made
nor
yet
do
we
obtain
it
by
theoretical
instruction
it
is
a
result
of
a
training
and
discipline
of
the
feelings
and
impulses
the
possibility
of
such
a
training
is
due
to
the
fact
that
feelings
and
impulses
are
rational
capacities
and
a
rational
capacity
can
be
developed
into
either
of
two
contrasted
activities
according
to
the
training
it
receives
you
can
not
train
stones
to
fall
upwards
but
you
can
train
a
hot
temper
to
display
itself
either
in
the
form
of
righteous
resentment
of
or
in
that
of
violent
defiance
of
all
authority
our
natural
emotions
and
impulses
are
in
themselves
neither
good
nor
bad
they
are
the
raw
material
out
of
which
training
makes
good
or
bad
character
according
to
the
direction
it
gives
to
them
the
effect
of
training
is
to
convert
the
indeterminate
tendency
into
a
fixed
habit
we
may
say
then
that
moral
goodness
is
a
fixed
state
of
the
soul
produced
by
habituation
by
being
trained
in
habits
of
endurance
and
fair
dealing
we
acquire
the
kind
of
character
to
which
it
is
pleasing
to
act
bravely
continently
and
fairly
and
disagreeable
to
act
unfairly
profligately
or
like
a
coward
when
habituation
has
brought
about
this
result
the
moral
excellences
in
question
have
become
part
of
our
inmost
self
and
we
are
in
full
possession
of
goodness
of
character
in
a
word
it
is
by
repeated
doing
of
right
acts
that
we
acquire
the
right
kind
of
character
but
what
general
characteristics
distinguish
right
acts
and
right
habits
from
wrong
ones
aristotle
is
guided
in
answering
the
question
by
an
analogy
which
is
really
at
the
bottom
of
all
greek
thinking
on
morality
the
thought
is
that
goodness
is
in
the
soul
what
health
and
fitness
are
in
the
body
and
that
the
preceptor
is
for
the
soul
what
the
physician
or
the
trainer
is
for
the
body
now
it
was
a
medical
theory
favoured
by
both
plato
and
aristotle
that
health
in
the
body
means
a
condition
of
balance
or
equilibration
among
the
elements
of
which
it
is
composed
when
the
hot
and
the
cold
the
moist
and
the
dry
in
the
composition
of
the
human
frame
exactly
balance
one
another
the
body
is
in
perfect
health
hence
the
object
of
the
regimen
of
the
physician
or
the
trainer
is
to
produce
and
maintain
a
proper
balance
or
proportion
between
the
ingredients
of
the
body
any
course
which
disturbs
this
balance
is
injurious
to
health
and
strength
you
damage
your
health
if
you
take
too
much
food
or
exercise
and
also
if
you
take
too
little
the
same
thing
is
true
of
health
in
the
soul
our
soul
s
health
may
be
injured
by
allowing
too
much
or
too
little
play
to
any
of
our
natural
impulses
or
feelings
we
may
lay
it
down
then
that
the
kind
of
training
which
gives
rise
to
a
good
habit
is
training
in
the
avoidance
of
the
opposite
errors
of
the
too
much
and
the
too
little
and
since
the
effect
of
training
is
to
produce
habits
which
issue
in
the
spontaneous
performance
of
the
same
kind
of
acts
by
which
the
habits
were
acquired
we
may
say
not
merely
that
goodness
of
character
is
produced
by
acts
which
exhibit
a
proper
balance
or
mean
but
that
it
is
a
settled
habit
of
acting
so
as
to
exhibit
the
same
balance
or
proportion
hence
the
formal
definition
of
goodness
of
character
is
that
it
is
a
settled
condition
of
the
soul
which
wills
or
chooses
the
mean
relatively
to
ourselves
this
mean
being
determined
by
a
rule
or
whatever
we
like
to
call
that
by
which
the
wise
man
determines
it
there
are
several
points
in
this
definition
of
the
mean
upon
which
moral
virtue
depends
of
which
we
must
take
note
unless
we
are
to
misunderstand
aristotle
seriously
to
begin
with
the
definition
expressly
says
that
moral
goodness
is
a
state
of
will
or
choice
thus
it
is
not
enough
that
one
should
follow
the
rule
of
the
mean
outwardly
in
one
s
actions
one
s
personal
will
must
be
regulated
by
it
goodness
of
character
is
inward
it
is
not
merely
outward
next
we
must
not
suppose
that
aristotle
means
that
the
just
enough
is
the
same
for
all
our
feelings
that
every
impulse
has
a
moral
right
to
the
same
authority
in
shaping
our
conduct
as
any
other
how
much
or
how
little
is
the
just
enough
in
connection
with
a
given
spring
of
action
is
one
of
the
things
which
the
wise
man
s
rule
has
to
determine
just
as
the
wise
physician
s
rule
may
determine
that
a
very
little
quantity
is
the
just
enough
in
the
case
of
some
articles
of
diet
or
curative
drugs
while
in
the
case
of
others
the
just
enough
may
be
a
considerable
amount
also
the
right
mean
is
not
the
same
for
every
one
what
we
have
to
attain
is
the
mean
relatively
to
and
this
will
be
different
for
persons
of
different
constitutions
and
in
different
conditions
it
is
this
relativity
of
the
just
enough
to
the
individual
s
personality
and
circumstances
which
makes
it
impossible
to
lay
down
precise
rules
of
conduct
applicable
alike
to
everybody
and
renders
the
practical
attainment
of
goodness
so
hard
it
is
my
duty
to
spend
some
part
of
my
income
in
buying
books
on
philosophy
but
no
general
rule
will
tell
me
what
percentage
of
my
income
is
the
right
amount
for
me
to
spend
in
this
way
that
depends
on
a
host
of
considerations
such
as
the
excess
of
my
income
above
my
necessary
expenses
and
the
like
or
again
the
just
enough
may
vary
with
the
same
man
according
to
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case
no
rule
of
thumb
application
of
a
formula
will
decide
such
problems
hence
aristotle
insists
that
the
right
mean
in
the
individual
case
has
always
to
be
determined
by
immediate
insight
this
is
precisely
why
goodness
of
intellect
needs
to
be
added
to
goodness
of
character
his
meaning
is
well
brought
out
by
an
illustration
which
i
borrow
from
professor
burnet
on
a
given
occasion
there
will
be
a
temperature
which
is
just
right
for
my
morning
bath
if
the
bath
is
hotter
than
this
it
will
be
too
hot
if
it
is
colder
it
will
be
too
cold
but
as
this
just
right
temperature
varies
with
the
condition
of
my
body
it
can
not
be
ascertained
by
simply
using
a
thermometer
if
i
am
in
good
general
health
i
shall
however
know
by
the
feel
of
the
water
when
the
temperature
is
right
so
if
i
am
in
good
moral
health
i
shall
know
without
appealing
to
a
formal
code
of
maxims
what
is
the
right
degree
of
indignation
to
show
in
a
given
case
how
it
should
be
shown
and
towards
whom
thus
we
see
why
aristotle
demands
goodness
of
character
as
a
preliminary
condition
of
goodness
of
intellect
or
judgment
in
moral
matters
finally
if
we
ask
by
rule
the
mean
is
determined
the
answer
will
be
that
the
rule
is
the
judgment
of
the
legislator
who
determines
what
is
the
right
mean
by
his
knowledge
of
the
conditions
on
which
the
of
the
community
depends
he
then
embodies
his
insight
in
the
laws
which
he
makes
and
the
regulations
he
imposes
on
the
educators
of
youth
the
final
aim
of
education
in
goodness
is
to
make
our
immediate
judgment
as
to
what
is
right
coincide
with
the
spirit
of
a
wise
legislation
the
introduction
of
the
reference
to
will
or
choice
into
the
definition
of
goodness
of
character
leads
aristotle
to
consider
the
relation
of
will
to
conduct
his
main
object
is
to
escape
the
paradoxical
doctrine
which
superficial
students
might
derive
from
the
works
of
plato
that
is
always
ignorance
aristotle
s
point
is
that
it
is
the
condition
of
will
revealed
by
men
s
acts
which
is
the
real
object
of
our
approval
or
blame
this
is
because
in
voluntary
action
the
man
himself
is
the
efficient
cause
of
his
act
hence
the
law
recognises
only
two
grounds
on
which
a
man
may
plead
that
he
is
not
answerable
for
what
he
does
actual
physical
compulsion
by
ignorance
not
due
to
the
man
s
own
previous
negligence
of
some
circumstances
material
to
the
issue
when
either
of
these
pleas
can
be
made
with
truth
the
man
does
not
really
contribute
by
his
choice
to
the
resulting
act
and
therefore
is
not
really
its
cause
but
a
plea
of
ignorance
of
the
general
laws
of
morality
does
not
excuse
i
can
not
escape
responsibility
for
a
murder
by
pleading
that
i
did
not
know
that
murder
is
wrong
such
a
plea
does
not
exempt
me
from
having
been
the
cause
of
the
murder
it
only
shows
that
my
moral
principles
are
depraved
more
precisely
will
is
a
process
which
has
both
an
intellectual
and
an
appetitive
element
the
appetitive
element
is
our
wish
for
some
result
the
intellectual
factor
is
the
calculation
of
the
steps
by
which
that
result
may
be
obtained
when
we
wish
for
the
result
we
begin
to
consider
how
it
might
be
brought
about
and
we
continue
our
analysis
until
we
find
that
the
chain
of
conditions
requisite
may
be
started
by
the
performance
of
some
act
now
in
our
power
to
do
will
may
thus
be
defined
as
the
deliberate
appetition
of
something
within
our
power
and
the
very
definition
shows
that
our
choice
is
an
efficient
cause
of
the
acts
we
choose
to
do
this
is
why
we
rightly
regard
men
as
responsible
or
answerable
for
their
acts
of
choice
good
and
bad
alike
from
the
analysis
of
goodness
of
character
we
proceed
to
that
of
goodness
of
intellect
the
important
point
is
to
decide
which
of
all
the
forms
of
goodness
of
intellect
is
that
which
must
be
combined
with
goodness
of
character
to
make
a
man
fit
to
be
a
citizen
of
the
state
it
must
be
a
kind
of
intellectual
excellence
which
makes
a
man
see
what
the
right
rule
by
which
the
mean
is
determined
is
now
when
we
come
to
consider
the
different
excellences
of
intellect
we
find
that
they
all
fall
under
one
of
two
heads
theoretical
or
speculative
wisdom
and
practical
wisdom
theoretical
wisdom
is
contained
in
the
sciences
which
give
us
universal
truths
about
the
fixed
and
unalterable
relations
of
the
things
in
the
universe
or
as
we
should
say
which
teach
us
the
laws
of
nature
its
method
is
syllogism
the
function
of
which
is
to
make
us
see
how
the
more
complex
truths
are
implied
in
simpler
principles
practical
wisdom
is
intelligence
as
employed
in
controlling
and
directing
human
life
to
the
production
of
the
happy
life
for
a
community
and
it
is
this
form
of
intellectual
excellence
which
we
require
of
the
statesman
it
is
required
of
him
not
only
that
he
should
know
in
general
what
things
are
good
for
man
but
also
that
he
should
be
able
to
judge
correctly
that
in
given
circumstances
such
and
such
an
act
is
the
one
which
will
secure
the
good
he
must
not
only
know
the
right
rule
itself
which
corresponds
to
the
major
premiss
of
syllogism
in
theoretical
science
but
he
must
understand
the
character
of
particular
acts
so
as
to
see
that
they
fall
under
the
right
rule
thus
the
method
of
practical
wisdom
will
be
analogous
to
that
of
theoretical
wisdom
in
both
cases
what
we
have
to
do
is
to
see
that
certain
special
facts
are
cases
of
a
general
law
or
rule
hence
aristotle
calls
the
method
of
practical
wisdom
the
practical
syllogism
or
syllogism
of
action
since
its
peculiarity
is
that
what
issues
from
the
putting
together
of
the
premisses
is
not
an
assertion
but
the
performance
of
an
act
in
the
syllogism
of
action
the
conclusion
that
is
to
say
the
performance
of
a
given
act
just
as
in
the
syllogism
of
theory
is
connected
with
the
rule
given
in
the
major
premiss
by
a
statement
of
fact
thus
the
performance
of
a
specific
act
such
as
the
writing
of
this
book
is
connected
with
the
general
rule
what
helps
to
spread
knowledge
ought
to
be
done
by
the
conviction
that
the
writing
of
this
book
helps
to
spread
knowledge
our
perception
of
such
a
fact
is
like
a
in
its
directness
and
immediacy
we
see
therefore
that
the
kind
of
intellectual
excellence
which
the
statesman
must
possess
embraces
at
once
a
right
conception
of
the
general
character
of
the
life
which
is
best
for
man
because
it
calls
into
play
his
specific
capacities
as
a
human
being
and
also
a
sound
judgment
in
virtue
of
which
he
sees
correctly
that
particular
acts
are
expressions
of
this
good
for
man
this
then
is
what
we
mean
by
practical
wisdom
so
far
then
it
would
seem
that
the
best
life
for
man
is
just
the
life
of
in
the
life
of
the
state
which
man
being
the
only
political
animal
or
animal
capable
of
life
in
a
state
has
as
his
peculiar
work
and
as
if
the
end
of
all
moral
education
should
be
to
make
us
good
and
efficient
citizens
but
in
the
as
elsewhere
the
end
of
aristotle
s
argument
has
a
way
of
forgetting
the
beginning
we
find
that
there
is
after
all
a
still
higher
life
open
to
man
than
that
of
public
affairs
affairs
and
business
of
all
kinds
are
only
undertaken
as
means
to
getting
leisure
just
as
civilised
men
go
to
war
not
for
the
love
of
war
itself
but
to
secure
peace
the
highest
aim
of
life
then
is
not
the
carrying
on
of
political
business
for
its
own
sake
but
the
worthy
and
noble
employment
of
leisure
the
periods
in
which
we
are
our
own
masters
it
has
the
advantage
that
it
depends
more
purely
on
ourselves
and
our
own
internal
resources
than
any
other
life
of
which
we
know
for
it
needs
very
little
equipment
with
external
goods
as
compared
with
any
form
of
the
life
of
action
it
calls
into
play
the
very
highest
of
our
own
capacities
as
intelligent
beings
and
for
that
very
reason
the
active
living
of
it
is
attended
with
the
purest
of
all
pleasures
in
it
moreover
we
enter
at
intervals
and
for
a
little
while
so
far
as
the
conditions
of
our
mundane
existence
allow
into
the
life
which
god
enjoys
through
an
unbroken
eternity
thus
we
reach
the
curious
paradox
that
while
the
life
of
contemplation
is
said
to
be
that
of
our
truest
self
it
is
also
maintained
that
this
highest
and
happiest
life
is
one
which
we
live
not
in
respect
of
being
human
but
in
respect
of
having
a
divine
something
in
us
when
we
ask
what
this
life
of
contemplation
includes
we
see
from
references
in
the
that
it
includes
the
genuinely
æsthetic
appreciation
of
good
literature
and
music
and
pictorial
and
plastic
art
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
what
bulks
most
largely
in
aristotle
s
mind
is
the
active
pursuit
of
science
for
its
own
sake
particularly
of
such
studies
as
first
philosophy
and
physics
which
deal
with
the
fundamental
structure
of
the
universe
aristotle
thus
definitely
ends
by
placing
the
life
of
the
scholar
and
the
student
on
the
very
summit
of
felicity
it
is
from
this
doctrine
that
mediæval
christianity
derives
its
opposition
between
the
and
and
its
preference
for
the
former
though
in
the
mediæval
mind
the
contemplative
life
has
come
to
mean
generally
a
kind
of
brooding
over
theological
speculations
and
of
absorption
in
mystical
ecstasy
very
foreign
to
the
spirit
of
aristotle
the
types
by
which
the
contrast
of
the
two
lives
is
illustrated
rachael
and
leah
mary
and
martha
are
familiar
to
all
readers
of
christian
literature
theory
of
the
man
is
by
nature
a
political
animal
a
being
who
can
only
develop
his
capacities
by
sharing
in
the
life
of
a
community
hence
aristotle
definitely
rejects
the
view
that
the
state
or
society
is
a
mere
creature
of
convention
or
agreement
an
institution
made
by
compact
between
individuals
for
certain
special
ends
not
growing
naturally
out
of
the
universal
demands
and
aspirations
of
humanity
mankind
he
urges
have
never
existed
at
all
as
isolated
individuals
some
rudimentary
form
of
social
organisation
is
to
be
found
wherever
men
are
to
be
found
the
actual
stages
in
the
development
of
social
organisation
have
been
three
the
family
the
village
community
the
city
state
in
the
very
rudest
forms
of
social
life
known
to
us
the
patriarchal
family
not
the
individual
is
the
social
unit
men
lived
at
first
in
separate
families
under
the
control
of
the
head
of
the
family
now
a
family
is
made
up
in
its
simplest
form
of
at
least
three
persons
a
man
his
wife
and
a
servant
or
slave
to
do
the
hard
work
though
very
poor
men
often
have
to
replace
the
servant
by
an
ox
as
the
drudge
of
all
work
children
when
they
come
swell
the
number
and
thus
we
see
the
beginnings
of
complex
social
relations
of
subordination
in
the
family
itself
it
involves
three
such
distinct
relations
that
of
husband
and
wife
that
of
parent
and
child
that
of
master
and
man
the
family
passes
into
the
village
community
partly
by
the
tendency
of
several
families
of
common
descent
to
remain
together
under
the
direction
of
the
oldest
male
member
of
the
group
partly
by
the
association
of
a
number
of
distinct
families
for
purposes
of
mutual
help
and
protection
against
common
dangers
neither
of
these
forms
of
association
however
makes
adequate
provision
for
the
most
permanent
needs
of
human
nature
complete
security
for
a
permanent
supply
of
material
necessaries
and
adequate
protection
only
come
when
a
number
of
such
scattered
communities
pool
their
resources
and
surround
themselves
with
a
city
wall
the
city
state
which
has
come
into
being
in
this
way
proves
adequate
to
provide
from
its
own
internal
resources
for
all
the
spiritual
as
well
as
the
material
needs
of
its
members
hence
the
independent
city
state
does
not
grow
as
civilisation
advances
into
any
higher
form
of
organisation
as
the
family
and
village
grew
into
it
it
is
the
end
the
last
word
of
social
progress
it
is
amazing
to
us
that
this
piece
of
cheap
conservatism
should
have
been
uttered
at
the
very
time
when
the
system
of
independent
city
states
had
visibly
broken
down
and
a
former
pupil
of
aristotle
himself
was
founding
a
gigantic
empire
to
take
their
place
as
the
vehicle
of
civilisation
the
end
for
which
the
state
exists
is
not
merely
its
own
as
we
have
seen
aristotle
assigns
a
higher
value
to
the
life
of
the
student
than
to
the
life
of
practical
affairs
since
it
is
only
in
the
civilised
state
that
the
student
can
pursue
his
vocation
the
ultimate
reason
for
which
the
state
exists
is
to
educate
its
citizens
in
such
a
way
as
shall
fit
them
to
make
the
noble
use
of
leisure
in
the
end
the
state
itself
is
a
means
to
the
spiritual
cultivation
of
its
individual
members
this
implies
that
the
chosen
few
who
have
a
vocation
to
make
full
use
of
the
opportunities
provided
for
leading
this
life
of
noble
leisure
are
the
real
end
for
the
sake
of
which
society
exists
the
other
citizens
who
have
no
qualification
for
any
life
higher
than
that
of
business
and
affairs
are
making
the
most
of
themselves
in
devoting
their
lives
to
the
conduct
and
maintenance
of
the
organisation
whose
full
advantages
they
are
unequal
to
share
in
it
is
from
this
point
of
view
also
that
aristotle
treats
the
social
problem
of
the
existence
of
a
class
whose
whole
life
is
spent
in
doing
the
hard
work
of
society
and
thus
setting
the
citizen
body
free
to
make
the
best
use
it
can
of
leisure
in
the
conditions
of
life
in
the
greek
world
this
class
consisted
mainly
of
slaves
and
thus
the
problem
aristotle
has
to
face
is
the
moral
justifiability
of
slavery
we
must
remember
that
he
knew
slavery
only
in
its
comparatively
humane
hellenic
form
the
slaves
of
whom
he
speaks
were
household
servants
and
assistants
in
small
businesses
he
had
not
before
his
eyes
the
system
of
enormous
industries
carried
on
by
huge
gangs
of
slaves
under
conditions
of
revolting
degradation
which
disgraced
the
later
roman
republic
and
the
early
roman
empire
or
the
southern
states
of
north
america
his
problems
are
in
all
essentials
much
the
same
as
those
which
concern
us
in
connection
with
the
social
position
of
the
classes
who
do
the
hard
bodily
work
of
the
community
much
consideration
is
given
in
the
to
the
classification
of
the
different
types
of
constitution
possible
for
the
the
current
view
was
that
there
are
three
main
types
distinguished
by
the
number
of
persons
who
form
the
sovereign
political
authority
monarchy
in
which
sovereign
power
belongs
to
a
single
person
oligarchy
in
which
it
is
in
the
hands
of
a
select
few
democracy
in
which
it
is
enjoyed
by
the
whole
body
of
the
citizens
aristotle
observes
correctly
that
the
really
fundamental
distinction
between
a
greek
oligarchy
and
a
greek
democracy
was
that
the
former
was
government
by
the
propertied
classes
the
latter
government
by
the
masses
hence
the
watchword
of
democracy
was
always
that
all
political
rights
should
belong
equally
to
all
citizens
that
of
oligarchy
that
a
man
s
political
status
should
be
graded
according
to
his
stake
in
the
country
both
ideals
are
according
to
him
equally
mistaken
since
the
real
end
of
government
which
both
overlook
is
the
promotion
of
the
good
life
in
a
state
which
recognises
this
ideal
an
aristocracy
or
government
by
the
best
only
the
best
men
will
possess
the
full
rights
of
citizenship
whether
they
are
many
or
few
there
might
even
be
a
monarch
at
the
head
of
such
a
state
if
it
happened
to
contain
some
one
man
of
outstanding
intellectual
and
moral
worth
such
a
state
should
be
the
very
opposite
of
a
great
imperial
power
it
should
that
its
cultivation
may
be
the
more
intensive
be
as
small
as
is
compatible
with
complete
independence
of
outside
communities
for
its
material
and
spiritual
sustenance
and
its
territory
should
only
be
large
enough
to
provide
its
members
with
the
permanent
possibility
of
ample
leisure
so
long
as
they
are
content
with
plain
and
frugal
living
though
it
ought
not
for
military
and
other
reasons
to
be
cut
off
from
communication
with
the
sea
the
great
military
and
commercial
high
road
of
the
greek
world
it
ought
not
to
be
near
enough
to
the
coast
to
run
any
risk
of
imperilling
its
moral
cultivation
by
becoming
a
great
emporium
like
the
athens
of
pericles
in
the
organisation
of
the
society
care
should
be
taken
to
exclude
the
agricultural
and
industrial
population
from
full
citizenship
which
carries
with
it
the
right
to
appoint
and
to
be
appointed
as
administrative
magistrates
this
is
because
these
classes
having
no
opportunity
for
the
worthy
employment
of
leisure
can
not
be
trusted
to
administer
the
state
for
the
high
ends
which
it
is
its
true
function
to
further
thus
aristotle
s
political
ideal
is
that
of
a
small
but
leisured
and
highly
cultivated
aristocracy
without
large
fortunes
or
any
remarkable
differences
in
material
wealth
free
from
the
spirit
of
adventure
and
enterprise
pursuing
the
arts
and
sciences
quietly
while
its
material
needs
are
supplied
by
the
labour
of
a
class
excluded
from
citizenship
kindly
treated
but
without
prospects
weimar
in
the
days
when
thackeray
knew
it
as
a
lad
would
apparently
reproduce
the
ideal
better
than
any
other
modern
state
one
can
think
of
the
object
of
the
is
however
not
merely
to
discuss
the
ideal
state
but
to
give
practical
advice
to
men
who
might
be
looking
forward
to
actual
political
life
and
would
therefore
largely
have
to
be
content
with
making
the
best
of
existing
institutions
in
the
absence
of
the
ideal
aristocracy
aristotle
s
preference
is
for
what
he
calls
polity
or
constitutional
government
a
sort
of
compromise
between
oligarchy
and
democracy
of
course
a
practical
statesman
may
have
to
work
with
a
theoretically
undesirable
constitution
such
as
an
oligarchy
or
an
unqualified
democracy
but
it
is
only
in
an
ideal
constitution
that
the
education
which
makes
its
subject
a
good
man
in
the
philosopher
s
sense
of
the
word
will
also
make
him
a
good
citizen
if
the
constitution
is
bad
then
the
education
best
fitted
to
make
a
man
loyal
to
it
may
have
to
be
very
different
from
that
which
you
would
choose
to
make
him
a
good
man
the
discussion
of
the
kind
of
education
desirable
for
the
best
kind
of
state
in
which
to
be
a
loyal
citizen
and
to
be
a
good
man
are
the
same
thing
is
perhaps
the
most
permanently
valuable
part
of
the
though
aristotle
s
writings
on
practical
philosophy
have
been
more
read
in
modern
times
than
any
other
part
of
his
works
they
are
far
from
being
his
best
and
most
thorough
performances
in
no
department
of
his
thought
is
he
quite
so
slavishly
dependent
on
his
master
plato
as
in
the
theory
of
the
good
for
man
and
the
character
of
moral
excellence
no
aristotelian
work
is
quite
so
commonplace
in
its
handling
of
a
vast
subject
as
the
in
truth
his
interest
in
these
social
questions
is
not
of
the
deepest
he
is
in
accordance
with
his
view
of
the
superiority
of
theoretical
science
entirely
devoid
of
the
spirit
of
the
social
reformer
what
he
really
cares
about
is
theology
and
physics
and
the
fact
that
the
objects
of
the
educational
regulations
of
the
are
all
designed
to
encourage
the
study
of
these
theoretical
sciences
makes
this
section
of
the
still
one
of
the
most
valuable
expositions
of
the
aims
and
requirements
of
a
liberal
education
all
education
must
be
under
public
control
and
education
must
be
universal
and
compulsory
public
control
is
necessary
not
merely
to
avoid
educational
anarchy
but
because
it
is
a
matter
of
importance
to
the
community
that
its
future
citizens
should
be
trained
in
the
way
which
will
make
them
most
loyal
to
the
constitution
and
the
ends
it
is
designed
to
subserve
even
in
one
of
the
bad
types
of
state
where
the
life
which
the
constitution
tends
to
foster
is
not
the
highest
the
legislator
s
business
is
to
see
that
education
is
directed
towards
fostering
the
spirit
of
the
constitution
there
is
to
be
an
atmosphere
which
impregnates
the
whole
of
the
teaching
and
it
is
to
be
an
atmosphere
of
public
spirit
the
only
advantage
which
aristotle
sees
in
private
education
is
that
it
allows
of
more
modification
of
programme
to
meet
the
special
needs
of
the
individual
pupil
than
a
rigid
state
education
which
is
to
be
the
same
for
all
the
actual
regulations
which
aristotle
lays
down
are
not
very
different
from
those
of
plato
both
philosophers
hold
that
primary
education
in
the
early
years
of
life
should
aim
partly
at
promoting
bodily
health
and
growth
by
a
proper
system
of
physical
exercises
partly
at
influencing
character
and
giving
a
refined
and
elevated
tone
to
the
mind
by
the
study
of
letters
art
and
music
both
agree
that
this
should
be
followed
in
the
later
teens
by
two
or
three
years
of
specially
rigorous
systematic
military
training
combined
with
a
taste
of
actual
service
in
the
less
exhausting
and
less
dangerous
parts
of
a
soldier
s
duty
it
is
only
after
this
at
about
the
age
at
which
young
men
now
take
a
university
course
that
plato
and
aristotle
would
have
the
serious
scientific
training
of
the
intellect
begun
the
leaves
the
subject
just
at
the
point
where
the
young
men
are
ready
to
undergo
their
special
military
training
thus
we
do
not
know
with
certainty
what
scientific
curriculum
aristotle
would
have
recommended
though
we
may
safely
guess
that
it
would
have
contained
comparatively
little
pure
mathematics
but
a
great
deal
of
astronomy
cosmology
and
biology
with
respect
to
the
primary
education
aristotle
has
a
good
deal
to
say
as
forcing
is
always
injurious
it
should
not
be
begun
too
soon
for
the
first
five
years
a
child
s
life
should
be
given
up
to
healthy
play
great
care
must
be
taken
that
children
are
not
allowed
to
be
too
much
with
servants
from
whom
they
may
imbibe
low
tastes
and
that
they
are
protected
against
any
familiarity
with
indecency
from
five
to
seven
a
child
may
begin
to
make
a
first
easy
acquaintance
with
the
life
of
the
school
by
looking
on
at
the
lessons
of
its
elders
the
real
work
of
school
education
is
to
begin
at
seven
and
not
before
we
next
have
to
consider
what
should
be
the
staple
subjects
of
an
education
meant
not
for
those
who
are
to
follow
some
particular
calling
but
for
all
the
full
citizens
of
a
state
aristotle
s
view
is
that
some
useful
subjects
must
of
course
be
taught
reading
and
writing
for
instance
are
useful
for
the
discharge
of
the
business
of
life
though
their
commercial
utility
is
not
the
highest
value
which
they
have
for
us
but
care
must
be
taken
that
only
those
useful
studies
which
are
also
liberal
should
be
taught
illiberal
or
mechanical
subjects
must
not
have
any
place
in
the
curriculum
a
liberal
education
means
as
the
name
shows
one
which
will
tend
to
make
its
recipient
a
free
man
and
not
a
slave
in
body
and
soul
the
mechanical
crafts
were
felt
by
aristotle
to
be
illiberal
because
they
leave
a
man
no
leisure
to
make
the
best
of
body
and
mind
practice
of
them
sets
a
stamp
on
the
body
and
narrows
the
mind
s
outlook
in
principle
then
no
study
should
form
a
subject
of
the
universal
curriculum
if
its
only
value
is
that
it
prepares
a
man
for
a
profession
followed
as
a
means
of
making
a
living
general
education
training
which
aims
at
the
development
of
body
and
mind
for
its
own
sake
must
be
kept
free
from
the
intrusion
of
everything
which
has
a
merely
commercial
value
and
tends
to
contract
the
mental
vision
it
is
the
same
principle
which
we
rightly
employ
ourselves
when
we
maintain
that
a
university
education
ought
not
to
include
specialisation
on
merely
technical
or
professional
studies
the
useful
subjects
which
have
at
the
same
time
a
higher
value
as
contributing
to
the
formation
of
taste
and
character
and
serving
to
elevate
and
refine
the
mind
include
besides
reading
and
writing
which
render
great
literature
accessible
to
us
bodily
culture
the
true
object
of
which
is
not
merely
to
make
the
body
strong
and
hardy
but
to
develop
the
moral
qualities
of
grace
and
courage
music
and
drawing
aristotle
holds
that
the
real
reason
for
making
children
learn
music
is
that
the
artistic
appreciation
of
really
great
music
is
one
of
the
ways
in
which
leisure
may
be
worthily
employed
and
to
appreciate
music
rightly
we
must
have
some
personal
training
in
musical
execution
that
all
art
and
music
in
particular
has
a
direct
influence
on
character
plato
and
aristotle
though
they
differ
on
certain
points
of
detail
are
agreed
that
the
influence
of
music
on
character
for
good
or
bad
is
enormous
music
they
say
is
the
most
imitative
of
all
the
arts
the
various
rhythms
times
and
scales
imitate
different
tempers
and
emotional
moods
and
it
is
a
fundamental
law
of
our
nature
that
we
grow
like
what
we
take
pleasure
in
seeing
or
having
imitated
or
represented
for
us
hence
if
we
are
early
accustomed
to
take
pleasure
in
the
imitation
of
the
manly
resolute
and
orderly
these
qualities
will
in
time
become
part
of
our
own
nature
this
is
why
right
musical
education
is
so
important
that
plato
declared
that
the
revolutionary
spirit
always
makes
its
first
appearance
in
innovations
on
established
musical
form
there
is
however
one
important
difference
between
the
two
philosophers
which
must
be
noted
because
it
concerns
aristotle
s
chief
contribution
to
the
philosophy
of
fine
art
plato
had
in
the
proposed
to
expel
florid
languishing
or
unduly
exciting
forms
of
music
not
only
from
the
schoolroom
but
from
life
altogether
on
the
ground
of
their
unwholesome
tendency
to
foster
an
unstable
and
morbid
character
in
those
who
enjoy
them
for
the
same
reason
he
had
proposed
the
entire
suppression
of
tragic
drama
aristotle
has
a
theory
which
is
directly
aimed
against
this
overstrained
puritanism
he
holds
that
the
exciting
and
sensational
art
which
would
be
very
bad
as
daily
food
may
be
very
useful
as
an
occasional
medicine
for
the
soul
he
would
retain
even
the
most
sensational
forms
of
music
on
account
of
what
he
calls
their
purgative
value
in
the
same
spirit
he
asserts
that
the
function
of
tragedy
with
its
sensational
representations
of
the
calamities
of
its
heroes
is
by
the
vehicle
of
fear
and
pity
to
purge
our
minds
of
those
and
similar
emotions
the
explanation
of
the
theory
is
to
be
sought
in
the
literal
sense
of
the
medical
term
purgative
according
to
the
medical
view
which
we
have
already
found
influencing
his
ethical
doctrine
health
consists
in
the
maintenance
of
an
equality
between
the
various
ingredients
of
the
body
every
now
and
again
it
happens
that
there
arise
superfluous
accretions
of
some
one
ingredient
which
are
not
carried
away
in
the
normal
routine
of
bodily
life
these
give
rise
to
serious
derangement
of
function
and
may
permanently
injure
the
working
of
the
organism
unless
they
are
removed
in
time
by
a
medicine
which
acts
as
a
purge
and
clears
the
body
of
a
superfluous
accumulation
the
same
thing
also
happens
in
the
life
of
the
soul
so
long
as
we
are
in
good
spiritual
health
our
various
feelings
and
emotional
moods
will
be
readily
discharged
in
action
in
the
course
of
our
daily
life
but
there
is
always
the
possibility
of
an
excessive
accumulation
of
emotional
moods
for
which
the
routine
of
daily
life
does
not
provide
an
adequate
discharge
in
action
unless
this
tendency
is
checked
we
may
contract
dangerously
morbid
habits
of
soul
thus
we
need
some
medicine
for
the
soul
against
this
danger
which
may
be
to
it
what
a
purgative
is
to
the
body
now
it
was
a
fact
observed
in
connection
with
some
of
the
more
extravagant
religious
cults
that
persons
suffering
from
an
excess
of
religious
frenzy
might
be
cured
homoeopathically
so
to
say
by
artificially
arousing
the
very
emotion
in
question
by
the
use
of
exciting
music
aristotle
extends
the
principle
by
suggesting
that
in
the
artificial
excitement
aroused
by
violently
stimulating
music
or
in
the
transports
of
sympathetic
apprehension
and
pity
with
which
we
follow
the
disasters
of
the
we
have
a
safe
and
ready
means
of
ridding
ourselves
of
morbid
emotional
strain
which
might
otherwise
have
worked
havoc
with
the
efficient
conduct
of
real
life
the
great
value
of
this
defence
of
the
occasional
employment
of
sensation
as
a
medicine
for
the
soul
is
obvious
unhappily
it
would
seem
to
have
so
dominated
aristotle
s
thought
on
the
functions
of
dramatic
art
as
to
blind
him
to
what
we
are
accustomed
to
think
the
nobler
functions
of
tragedy
no
book
has
had
a
more
curious
fate
than
the
little
manual
for
intending
composers
of
tragedies
which
is
all
that
remains
to
us
of
aristotle
s
lectures
on
poetry
this
is
not
the
place
to
tell
the
story
of
the
way
in
which
the
great
classical
french
playwrights
who
hopelessly
misunderstood
the
meaning
of
aristotle
s
chief
special
directions
but
quite
correctly
divined
that
his
lectures
were
meant
to
be
an
actual
for
the
dramatist
deliberately
constructed
their
masterpieces
in
absolute
submission
to
regulations
for
which
they
had
no
better
reasons
than
that
they
had
once
been
given
magisterially
by
an
ancient
greek
philosopher
but
it
may
be
worth
while
to
remark
that
the
worth
of
aristotle
s
account
of
tragedy
as
has
probably
been
vastly
overrated
from
first
to
last
the
standpoint
he
assumes
in
his
verdicts
on
the
great
tragic
poets
is
that
of
the
gallery
what
he
insists
on
all
through
probably
because
he
has
the
purgative
effect
of
the
play
always
in
his
mind
is
a
plot
with
plenty
of
melodramatic
surprise
in
the
incidents
and
a
thoroughly
sensational
culmination
in
a
sense
of
unrelieved
catastrophe
over
which
the
spectator
can
have
a
good
cry
and
so
get
well
purged
of
his
superfluous
emotion
it
is
clear
from
his
repeated
allusions
that
the
play
he
admired
above
all
others
was
the
of
sophocles
but
it
is
equally
clear
that
he
admired
it
not
for
the
profound
insight
into
human
life
and
destiny
or
the
deep
sense
of
the
mystery
of
things
which
some
modern
critics
have
found
in
it
but
because
its
plot
is
the
best
and
most
startling
detective
story
ever
devised
and
its
finale
a
triumph
of
melodramatic
horror
the
english
reader

aristotle
