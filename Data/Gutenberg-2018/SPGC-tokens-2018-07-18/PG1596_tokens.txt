later
in

in

he
was

by
no

than
smoke

this

the

he
missing

your

suggestions
do
let

know

from
me
if
he
does
make

i

because
i
getting
real
money
for
my

from

that
dub
who
doing
the
musical
and
art
criticism
another
thing
san

has
always
had
a
literature
of
her
own
but
she
has
any
now
tell
him
to
kick
around
and
get
some
gink
to
turn
out
a
live
serial
and
to
put
into
it
the
real
romance
and
glamour
and
colour
of
san
francisco
and
down
to
the
office
of
the
billow
went
kit
bellew
faithfully
to
instruct
listened
debated
agreed
fired
the
dub
who
wrote
criticism
further
had
a
way
with
him
the
very
way
that
was
feared
by
gillet
in
distant
paris
when
wanted
anything
no
friend
could
deny
him
he
was
sweetly
and
compellingly
irresistible
before
kit
bellew
could
escape
from
the
office
he
had
become
an
associate
editor
had
agreed
to
write
weekly
columns
of
criticism
till
some
decent
pen
was
found
and
had
pledged
himself
to
write
a
weekly
instalment
of
ten
thousand
words
on
the
san
francisco
serial
and
all
this
without
pay
the
billow
was
paying
yet
explained
and
just
as
convincingly
had
he
exposited
that
there
was
only
one
man
in
san
francisco
capable
of
writing
the
serial
and
that
man
kit
bellew
oh
lord
i
the
gink
kit
had
groaned
to
himself
afterwards
on
the
narrow
stairway
and
thereat
had
begun
his
servitude
to
and
the
insatiable
columns
of
the
billow
week
after
week
he
held
down
an
office
chair
stood
off
creditors
wrangled
with
printers
and
turned
out
thousand
words
of
all
sorts
weekly
nor
did
his
labours
lighten
the
billow
was
ambitious
it
went
in
for
illustration
the
processes
were
expensive
it
never
had
any
money
to
pay
kit
bellew
and
by
the
same
token
it
was
unable
to
pay
for
any
additions
to
the
office
staff
this
is
what
comes
of
being
a
good
fellow
kit
grumbled
one
day
thank
god
for
good
fellows
then
cried
with
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
gripped
kit
hand
you
all
that
saved
me
kit
but
for
you
i
have
gone
bust
just
a
little
longer
old
man
and
things
will
be
easier
never
was
kit
plaint
i
see
my
fate
clearly
i
shall
be
here
always
a
little
later
he
thought
he
saw
his
way
out
watching
his
chance
in
presence
he
fell
over
a
chair
a
few
minutes
afterwards
he
bumped
into
the
corner
of
the
desk
and
with
fumbling
fingers
capsized
a
paste
pot
out
late
queried
kit
brushed
his
eyes
with
his
hands
and
peered
about
him
anxiously
before
replying
no
it
not
that
it
my
eyes
they
seem
to
be
going
back
on
me
that
all
for
several
days
he
continued
to
fall
over
and
bump
into
the
office
furniture
but
heart
was
not
softened
i
tell
you
what
kit
he
said
one
day
you
got
to
see
an
oculist
there
doctor
hassdapple
he
a
crackerjack
and
it
wo
cost
you
anything
we
can
get
it
for
advertizing
i
see
him
myself
and
true
to
his
word
he
dispatched
kit
to
the
oculist
there
nothing
the
matter
with
your
eyes
was
the
doctor
verdict
after
a
lengthy
examination
in
fact
your
eyes
are
magnificent
a
pair
in
a
million
do
tell
kit
pleaded
and
give
me
a
pair
of
black
glasses
the
result
of
this
was
that
sympathized
and
talked
glowingly
of
the
time
when
the
billow
would
be
on
its
feet
luckily
for
kit
bellew
he
had
his
own
income
small
it
was
compared
with
some
yet
it
was
large
enough
to
enable
him
to
belong
to
several
clubs
and
maintain
a
studio
in
the
latin
quarter
in
point
of
fact
since
his
associate
editorship
his
expenses
had
decreased
prodigiously
he
had
no
time
to
spend
money
he
never
saw
the
studio
any
more
nor
entertained
the
local
bohemians
with
his
famous
suppers
yet
he
was
always
broke
for
the
billow
in
perennial
distress
absorbed
his
cash
as
well
as
his
brains
there
were
the
illustrators
who
periodically
refused
to
illustrate
the
printers
who
periodically
refused
to
print
and
the
office
boy
who
frequently
refused
to
officiate
at
such
times
looked
at
kit
and
kit
did
the
rest
when
the
steamship
excelsior
arrived
from
alaska
bringing
the
news
of
the
klondike
strike
that
set
the
country
mad
kit
made
a
purely
frivolous
proposition
look
here
he
said
this
gold
rush
is
going
to
be
big
the
days
of
over
again
suppose
i
cover
it
for
the
billow
i
pay
my
own
expenses
shook
his
head
ca
spare
you
from
the
office
kit
then
there
that
serial
besides
i
saw
jackson
not
an
hour
ago
he
starting
for
the
klondike
and
he
agreed
to
send
a
weekly
letter
and
photos
i
would
let
him
get
away
till
he
promised
and
the
beauty
of
it
is
that
it
does
cost
us
anything
the
next
kit
heard
of
the
klondike
was
when
he
dropped
into
the
club
that
afternoon
and
in
an
alcove
off
the
library
encountered
his
uncle
hello
avuncular
relative
kit
greeted
sliding
into
a
leather
chair
and
spreading
out
his
legs
wo
you
join
me
he
ordered
a
cocktail
but
the
uncle
contented
himself
with
the
thin
native
claret
he
invariably
drank
he
glanced
with
irritated
disapproval
at
the
cocktail
and
on
to
his
nephew
face
kit
saw
a
lecture
gathering
i
only
a
minute
he
announced
hastily
i
got
to
run
and
take
in
that
keith
exhibition
at
ellery
and
do
half
a
column
on
it
what
the
matter
with
you
the
other
demanded
you
pale
a
wreck
kit
only
answer
was
a
groan
i
have
the
pleasure
of
burying
you
i
can
see
that
kit
shook
his
head
sadly
no
destroying
worm
thank
you
cremation
for
mine
john
bellew
came
of
the
old
hard
and
hardy
stock
that
had
crossed
the
plains
by
in
the
fifties
and
in
him
was
this
same
hardness
and
the
hardness
of
a
childhood
spent
in
the
conquering
of
a
new
land
you
not
living
right
christopher
i
ashamed
of
you
primrose
path
eh
kit
chuckled
the
older
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
shake
not
your
gory
locks
at
me
avuncular
i
wish
it
were
the
primrose
path
but
that
all
cut
out
i
have
no
time
then
what
overwork
john
bellew
laughed
harshly
and
incredulously
honest
again
came
the
laughter
men
are
the
products
of
their
environment
kit
proclaimed
pointing
at
the
other
glass
your
mirth
is
thin
and
bitter
as
your
drink
overwork
was
the
sneer
you
never
earned
a
cent
in
your
life
you
bet
i
have
only
i
never
got
it
i
earning
five
hundred
a
week
right
now
and
doing
four
men
work
pictures
that
wo
sell
or
er
fancy
work
of
some
sort
can
you
swim
i
used
to
sit
a
horse
i
have
essayed
that
adventure
john
bellew
snorted
his
disgust
i
glad
your
father
did
live
to
see
you
in
all
the
glory
of
your
gracelessness
he
said
your
father
was
a
man
every
inch
of
him
do
you
get
it
a
man
i
think
he
have
whaled
all
this
musical
and
artistic
tomfoolery
out
of
you
alas
these
degenerate
days
kit
sighed
i
could
understand
it
and
tolerate
it
the
other
went
on
savagely
if
you
succeeded
at
it
you
never
earned
a
cent
in
your
life
nor
done
a
tap
of
man
work
etchings
and
pictures
and
fans
kit
contributed
unsoothingly
you
a
dabbler
and
a
failure
what
pictures
have
you
painted
dinky
and
nightmare
posters
you
never
had
one
exhibited
even
here
in
san
ah
you
forget
there
is
one
in
the
jinks
room
of
this
very
club
a
gross
cartoon
music
your
dear
fool
of
a
mother
spent
hundreds
on
lessons
you
dabbled
and
failed
you
never
even
earned
a
piece
by
accompanying
some
one
at
a
concert
your
songs
rot
that
never
printed
and
that
sung
only
by
a
pack
of
fake
bohemians
i
had
a
book
published
once
those
sonnets
you
remember
kit
interposed
meekly
what
did
it
cost
you
only
a
couple
of
hundred
any
other
achievements
i
had
a
forest
play
acted
at
the
summer
jinks
what
did
you
get
for
it
glory
and
you
used
to
swim
and
you
have
essayed
to
sit
a
horse
john
bellew
set
his
glass
down
with
unnecessary
violence
what
earthly
good
are
you
anyway
you
were
well
put
up
yet
even
at
university
you
did
play
football
you
did
row
you
i
boxed
and
fenced
some
when
did
you
last
box
not
since
but
i
was
considered
an
excellent
judge
of
time
and
distance
only
i
was
go
on
considered
desultory
lazy
you
mean
i
always
imagined
it
was
an
euphemism
my
father
sir
your
grandfather
old
isaac
bellew
killed
a
man
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
when
he
was
years
old
the
man
no
your
you
graceless
scamp
but
you
never
kill
a
mosquito
at
the
times
have
changed
oh
my
avuncular
they
send
men
to
state
prisons
for
homicide
now
your
father
rode
one
hundred
and
miles
without
sleeping
and
killed
three
horses
had
he
lived
he
have
snored
over
the
course
in
a
pullman
the
older
man
was
on
the
verge
of
choking
with
wrath
but
swallowed
it
down
and
managed
to
articulate
how
old
are
you
i
have
reason
to
i
know
you
finished
college
at
dabbled
and
played
and
frilled
for
five
years
before
god
and
man
of
what
use
are
you
when
i
was
your
age
i
had
one
suit
of
underclothes
i
was
riding
with
the
cattle
in
colusa
i
was
hard
as
rocks
and
i
could
sleep
on
a
rock
i
lived
on
jerked
beef
and
i
am
a
better
man
physically
right
now
than
you
are
you
weigh
about
one
hundred
and
i
can
throw
you
right
now
or
thrash
you
with
my
fists
it
does
take
a
physical
prodigy
to
mop
up
cocktails
or
pink
tea
kit
murmured
deprecatingly
do
you
see
my
avuncular
the
times
have
changed
besides
i
was
brought
up
right
my
dear
fool
of
a
john
bellew
started
angrily
you
described
her
was
too
good
to
me
kept
me
in
cotton
wool
and
all
the
rest
now
if
when
i
was
a
youngster
i
had
taken
some
of
those
intensely
masculine
vacations
you
go
in
for
i
wonder
why
you
invite
me
sometimes
you
took
hal
and
robbie
all
over
the
sierras
and
on
that
mexico
trip
i
guess
you
were
too
lord
fauntleroyish
your
fault
avuncular
and
my
dear
er
mother
how
was
i
to
know
the
hard
i
was
only
a
what
was
there
left
but
etchings
and
pictures
and
fans
was
it
my
fault
that
i
never
had
to
sweat
the
older
man
looked
at
his
nephew
with
unconcealed
disgust
he
had
no
patience
with
levity
from
the
lips
of
softness
well
i
going
to
take
another
one
of
those
masculine
vacations
suppose
i
asked
you
to
come
along
rather
belated
i
must
say
where
is
it
hal
and
robert
are
going
in
to
klondike
and
i
going
to
see
them
across
the
pass
and
down
to
the
lakes
then
he
got
no
further
for
the
young
man
had
sprung
forward
and
gripped
his
hand
my
preserver
john
bellew
was
immediately
suspicious
he
had
not
dreamed
the
invitation
would
be
accepted
you
do
mean
it
he
said
when
do
we
start
it
will
be
a
hard
trip
you
be
in
the
way
no
i
wo
i
work
i
learned
to
work
since
i
went
on
the
billow
each
man
has
to
take
a
year
supplies
in
with
him
there
be
such
a
jam
the
indian
packers
wo
be
able
to
handle
it
hal
and
robert
will
have
to
pack
their
outfits
across
themselves
that
what
going
along
for
to
help
them
pack
it
you
come
you
have
to
do
the
same
watch
me
you
ca
pack
was
the
objection
when
do
we
start
you
need
take
it
to
yourself
that
your
lecture
on
the
hard
has
done
it
kit
said
at
parting
i
just
had
to
get
away
somewhere
anywhere
from
who
is
a
jap
no
he
an
irishman
and
a
and
my
best
friend
the
editor
and
proprietor
and
big
squeeze
of
the
billow
what
he
says
goes
he
can
make
ghosts
walk
that
night
kit
bellew
wrote
a
note
to
it
only
a
several
weeks
vacation
he
explained
you
have
to
get
some
gink
to
dope
out
instalments
for
that
serial
sorry
old
man
but
my
health
demands
it
i
kick
in
twice
as
hard
when
i
get
back
ii
kit
bellew
landed
through
the
madness
of
the
dyea
beach
congested
with
outfits
of
thousands
of
men
this
immense
mass
of
luggage
and
food
flung
ashore
in
mountains
by
the
steamers
was
beginning
slowly
to
dribble
up
the
dyea
valley
and
across
chilcoot
it
was
a
portage
of
miles
and
could
be
accomplished
only
on
the
backs
of
men
despite
the
fact
that
the
indian
packers
had
jumped
the
freight
from
eight
cents
a
pound
to
forty
they
were
swamped
with
the
work
and
it
was
plain
that
winter
would
catch
the
major
portion
of
the
outfits
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
divide
tenderest
of
the
was
kit
like
many
hundreds
of
others
he
carried
a
big
revolver
swung
on
a
of
this
his
uncle
filled
with
memories
of
old
lawless
days
was
likewise
guilty
but
kit
bellew
was
romantic
he
was
fascinated
by
the
froth
and
sparkle
of
the
gold
rush
and
viewed
its
life
and
movement
with
an
artist
eye
he
did
not
take
it
seriously
as
he
said
on
the
steamer
it
was
not
his
funeral
he
was
merely
on
a
vacation
and
intended
to
peep
over
the
top
of
the
pass
for
a
see
and
then
to
return
leaving
his
party
on
the
sand
to
wait
for
the
putting
ashore
of
the
freight
he
strolled
up
the
beach
toward
the
old
trading
post
he
did
not
swagger
though
he
noticed
that
many
of
the
individuals
did
a
strapping
indian
passed
him
carrying
an
unusually
large
pack
kit
swung
in
behind
admiring
the
splendid
calves
of
the
man
and
the
grace
and
ease
with
which
he
moved
along
under
his
burden
the
indian
dropped
his
pack
on
the
scales
in
front
of
the
post
and
kit
joined
the
group
of
admiring
who
surrounded
him
the
pack
weighed
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
which
fact
was
uttered
back
and
forth
in
tones
of
awe
it
was
going
some
kit
decided
and
he
wondered
if
he
could
lift
such
a
weight
much
less
walk
off
with
it
going
to
lake
linderman
with
it
old
man
he
asked
the
indian
swelling
with
pride
grunted
an
affirmative
how
much
you
make
that
one
pack
fifty
dollar
here
kit
slid
out
of
the
conversation
a
young
woman
standing
in
the
doorway
had
caught
his
eye
unlike
other
women
landing
from
the
steamers
she
was
neither
nor
she
was
dressed
as
any
woman
travelling
anywhere
would
be
dressed
what
struck
him
was
the
justness
of
her
being
there
a
feeling
that
somehow
she
belonged
moreover
she
was
young
and
pretty
the
bright
beauty
and
colour
of
her
oval
face
held
him
and
he
looked
looked
till
she
resented
and
her
own
eyes
and
dark
met
his
in
cool
survey
from
his
face
they
travelled
in
evident
amusement
down
to
the
big
revolver
at
his
thigh
then
her
eyes
came
back
to
his
and
in
them
was
amused
contempt
it
struck
him
like
a
blow
she
turned
to
the
man
beside
her
and
indicated
kit
the
man
glanced
him
over
with
the
same
amused
contempt
chechaquo
the
girl
said
the
man
who
looked
like
a
tramp
in
his
cheap
overalls
and
dilapidated
woollen
jacket
grinned
dryly
and
kit
felt
withered
though
he
knew
not
why
but
anyway
she
was
an
unusually
pretty
girl
he
decided
as
the
two
moved
off
he
noted
the
way
of
her
walk
and
recorded
the
judgment
that
he
would
recognize
it
after
the
lapse
of
a
thousand
years
did
you
see
that
man
with
the
girl
kit
neighbour
asked
him
excitedly
know
who
he
is
kit
shook
his
head
cariboo
charley
he
was
just
pointed
out
to
me
he
struck
it
big
on
klondike
old
timer
been
on
the
yukon
a
dozen
years
he
just
come
out
what
chechaquo
mean
kit
asked
you
one
i
one
was
the
answer
maybe
i
am
but
you
got
to
search
me
what
does
it
mean
on
his
way
back
to
the
beach
kit
turned
the
phrase
over
and
over
it
rankled
to
be
called
by
a
slender
chit
of
a
woman
going
into
a
corner
among
the
heaps
of
freight
his
mind
still
filled
with
the
vision
of
the
indian
with
the
redoubtable
pack
kit
essayed
to
learn
his
own
strength
he
picked
out
a
sack
of
flour
which
he
knew
weighed
an
even
hundred
pounds
he
stepped
astride
of
it
reached
down
and
strove
to
get
it
on
his
shoulder
his
first
conclusion
was
that
one
hundred
pounds
was
the
real
heavy
his
next
was
that
his
back
was
weak
his
third
was
an
oath
and
it
occurred
at
the
end
of
five
futile
minutes
when
he
collapsed
on
top
of
the
burden
with
which
he
was
wrestling
he
mopped
his
forehead
and
across
a
heap
of
saw
john
bellew
gazing
at
him
wintry
amusement
in
his
eyes
god
proclaimed
that
apostle
of
the

of
our

come
a
race
of
weaklings
when
i
was
sixteen
i
toyed
with

that
i
was

and
i

with
it
when
i
sixty
you
got
to
show
me
john
bellew
did
he
was
but
he
bent
over
the
sack
applied
a
tentative
shifting
grip
that
balanced
it
and
with
a
quick
heave
stood
erect
the
somersaulted
sack
of
flour
on
his
shoulder

my

a

took
off
his
hat
reverently
you
a

avuncular
a
shining
wonder
d
think
i
can
learn
the
knack
john
bellew
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
be
hitting
the
back
trail
before
we
get
started
never
you
fear
kit
groaned
there
the
roaring
lion
down
there
i
not
going
back
till
i
have
to
iii
kit
first
pack
was
a
success
up
to
finnegan
crossing
they
had
managed
to
get
indians
to
carry
the
outfit
from
that
point
their
own
backs
must
do
the
work
they
planned
to
move
forward
at
the
rate
of
a
mile
a
day
it
looked
easy
on
paper
since
john
bellew
was
to
stay
in
camp
and
do
the
cooking
he
would
be
unable
to
make
more
than
an
occasional
pack
so
to
each
of
the
three
young
men
fell
the
task
of
carrying
eight
hundred
pounds
one
mile
each
day
if
they
made
packs
it
meant
a
daily
walk
of
sixteen
miles
loaded
and
of
fifteen
miles
light
because
we
do
the
last
time
kit
explained
the
pleasant
discovery
packs
meant
nineteen
miles
travel
each
day
and
packs
meant
only
fifteen
miles
i
do
like
walking
said
kit
therefore
i
shall
carry
one
hundred
pounds
he
caught
the
grin
of
incredulity
on
his
uncle
face
and
added
hastily
of
course
i
shall
work
up
to
it
a
fellow
got
to
learn
the
ropes
and
tricks
i
start
with
fifty
he
did
and
ambled
gaily
along
the
trail
he
dropped
the
sack
at
the
next
and
ambled
back
it
was
easier
than
he
had
thought
but
two
miles
had
rubbed
off
the
velvet
of
his
strength
and
exposed
the
underlying
softness
his
second
pack
was
pounds
it
was
more
difficult
and
he
no
longer
ambled
several
times
following
the
custom
of
all
packers
he
sat
down
on
the
ground
resting
the
pack
behind
him
on
a
rock
or
stump
with
the
third
pack
he
became
bold
he
fastened
the
straps
to
a
sack
of
beans
and
started
at
the
end
of
a
hundred
yards
he
felt
that
he
must
collapse
he
sat
down
and
mopped
his
face
short
hauls
and
short
rests
he
muttered
that
the
trick
sometimes
he
did
not
make
a
hundred
yards
and
each
time
he
struggled
to
his
feet
for
another
short
haul
the
pack
became
undeniably
heavier
he
panted
for
breath
and
the
sweat
streamed
from
him
before
he
had
covered
a
quarter
of
a
mile
he
stripped
off
his
woollen
shirt
and
hung
it
on
a
tree
a
little
later
he
discarded
his
hat
at
the
end
of
half
a
mile
he
decided
he
was
finished
he
had
never
exerted
himself
so
in
his
life
and
he
knew
that
he
was
finished
as
he
sat
and
panted
his
gaze
fell
upon
the
big
revolver
and
the
heavy
ten
pounds
of
junk
he
sneered
as
he
unbuckled
it
he
did
not
bother
to
hang
it
on
a
tree
but
flung
it
into
the
underbush
and
as
the
steady
tide
of
packers
flowed
by
him
up
trail
and
down
he
noted
that
the
other
were
beginning
to
shed
their
shooting
irons
his
short
hauls
decreased
at
times
a
hundred
feet
was
all
he
could
stagger
and
then
the
ominous
pounding
of
his
heart
against
his
and
the
sickening
totteriness
of
his
knees
compelled
him
to
rest
and
his
rests
grew
longer
but
his
mind
was
busy
it
was
a
mile
portage
which
represented
as
many
days
and
this
by
all
accounts
was
the
easiest
part
of
it
wait
till
you
get
to
chilcoot
others
told
him
as
they
rested
and
talked
where
you
climb
with
hands
and
feet
they
ai
going
to
be
no
chilcoot
was
his
answer
not
for
me
long
before
that
i
be
at
peace
in
my
little
couch
beneath
the
moss
a
slip
and
a
violent
wrenching
effort
at
recovery
frightened
him
he
felt
that
everything
inside
him
had
been
torn
asunder
if
ever
i
fall
down
with
this
on
my
back
i
a
goner
he
told
another
packer
that
nothing
came
the
answer
wait
till
you
hit
the
canyon
you
have
to
cross
a
raging
torrent
on
a
pine
tree
no
guide
ropes
nothing
and
the
water
boiling
at
the
sag
of
the
log
to
your
knees
if
you
fall
with
a
pack
on
your
back
there
no
getting
out
of
the
straps
you
just
stay
there
and
drown
sounds
good
to
me
he
retorted
and
out
of
the
depths
of
his
exhaustion
he
almost
half
meant
it
they
drown
three
or
four
a
day
there
the
man
assured
him
i
helped
fish
a
german
out
there
he
had
four
thousand
in
greenbacks
on
him
cheerful
i
must
say
said
kit
battling
his
way
to
his
feet
and
tottering
on
he
and
the
sack
of
beans
became
a
perambulating
tragedy
it
reminded
him
of
the
old
man
of
the
sea
who
sat
on
sinbad
neck
and
this
was
one
of
those
intensely
masculine
vacations
he
meditated
compared
with
it
the
servitude
to
was
sweet
again
and
again
he
was
nearly
seduced
by
the
thought
of
abandoning
the
sack
of
beans
in
the
brush
and
of
sneaking
around
the
camp
to
the
beach
and
catching
a
steamer
for
civilization
but
he
did
somewhere
in
him
was
the
strain
of
the
hard
and
he
repeated
over
and
over
to
himself
that
what
other
men
could
do
he
could
it
became
a
nightmare
chant
and
he
gibbered
it
to
those
that
passed
him
on
the
trail
at
other
times
resting
he
watched
and
envied
the
stolid
indians
that
plodded
by
under
heavier
packs
they
never
seemed
to
rest
but
went
on
and
on
with
a
steadiness
and
certitude
that
was
to
him
appalling
he
sat
and
cursed
he
had
no
breath
for
it
when
under
way
and
fought
the
temptation
to
sneak
back
to
san
francisco
before
the
mile
pack
was
ended
he
ceased
cursing
and
took
to
crying
the
tears
were
tears
of
exhaustion
and
of
disgust
with
self
if
ever
a
man
was
a
wreck
he
was
as
the
end
of
the
pack
came
in
sight
he
strained
himself
in
desperation
gained
the
and
pitched
forward
on
his
face
the
beans
on
his
back
it
did
not
kill
him
but
he
lay
for
fifteen
minutes
before
he
could
summon
sufficient
shreds
of
strength
to
release
himself
from
the
straps
then
he
became
deathly
sick
and
was
so
found
by
robbie
who
had
similar
troubles
of
his
own
it
was
this
sickness
of
robbie
that
braced
him
up
what
other
men
can
do
we
can
do
kit
told
him
though
down
in
his
heart
he
wondered
whether
or
not
he
was
bluffing
iv
and
i
am
years
old
and
a
man
he
privately
assured
himself
many
times
in
the
days
that
followed
there
was
need
for
it
at
the
end
of
a
week
though
he
had
succeeded
in
moving
his
eight
hundred
pounds
forward
a
mile
a
day
he
had
lost
fifteen
pounds
of
his
own
weight
his
face
was
lean
and
haggard
all
resilience
had
gone
out
of
his
body
and
mind
he
no
longer
walked
but
plodded
and
on
the
travelling
light
his
feet
dragged
almost
as
much
as
when
he
was
loaded
he
had
become
a
work
animal
he
fell
asleep
over
his
food
and
his
sleep
was
heavy
and
beastly
save
when
he
was
aroused
screaming
with
agony
by
the
cramps
in
his
legs
every
part
of
him
ached
he
tramped
on
raw
blisters
yet
this
was
even
easier
than
the
fearful
bruising
his
feet
received
on
the
rocks
of
the
dyea
flats
across
which
the
trail
led
for
two
miles
these
two
miles
represented
miles
of
travelling
he
washed
his
face
once
a
day
his
nails
torn
and
broken
and
afflicted
with
hangnails
were
never
cleaned
his
shoulders
and
chest
galled
by
the
made
him
think
and
for
the
first
time
with
understanding
of
the
horses
he
had
seen
on
city
streets
one
ordeal
that
nearly
destroyed
him
at
first
had
been
the
food
the
extraordinary
amount
of
work
demanded
extraordinary
stoking
and
his
stomach
was
unaccustomed
to
great
quantities
of
bacon
and
of
the
coarse
highly
poisonous
brown
beans
as
a
result
his
stomach
went
back
on
him
and
for
several
days
the
pain
and
irritation
of
it
and
of
starvation
nearly
broke
him
down
and
then
came
the
day
of
joy
when
he
could
eat
like
a
ravenous
animal
and
ask
for
more
when
they
had
moved
the
outfit
across
the
at
the
mouth
of
the
canyon
they
made
a
change
in
their
plans
word
had
come
across
the
pass
that
at
lake
linderman
the
last
available
trees
for
building
boats
were
being
cut
the
two
cousins
with
tools
whipsaw
blankets
and
grub
on
their
backs
went
on
leaving
kit
and
his
uncle
to
hustle
along
the
outfit
john
bellew
now
shared
the
cooking
with
kit
and
both
packed
shoulder
to
shoulder
time
was
flying
and
on
the
peaks
the
first
snow
was
falling
to
be
caught
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
pass
meant
a
delay
of
nearly
a
year
the
older
man
put
his
iron
back
under
a
hundred
pounds
kit
was
shocked
but
he
gritted
his
teeth
and
fastened
his
own
straps
to
a
hundred
pounds
it
hurt
but
he
had
learned
the
knack
and
his
body
purged
of
all
softness
and
fat
was
beginning
to
harden
up
with
lean
and
bitter
muscle
also
he
observed
and
devised
he
took
note
of
the
worn
by
the
indians
and
manufactured
one
for
himself
which
he
used
in
addition
to
the
it
made
things
easier
so
that
he
began
the
practice
of
piling
any
light
cumbersome
piece
of
luggage
on
top
thus
he
was
soon
able
to
bend
along
with
a
hundred
pounds
in
the
straps
fifteen
or
twenty
more
lying
loosely
on
top
the
pack
and
against
his
neck
an
axe
or
a
pair
of
oars
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
the
nested
of
the
camp
but
work
as
they
would
the
toil
increased
the
trail
grew
more
rugged
their
packs
grew
heavier
and
each
day
saw
the
dropping
down
the
mountains
while
freight
jumped
to
sixty
cents
no
word
came
from
the
cousins
beyond
so
they
knew
they
must
be
at
work
chopping
down
the
standing
trees
and
whipsawing
them
into
john
bellew
grew
anxious
capturing
a
bunch
of
indians
from
lake
linderman
he
persuaded
them
to
put
their
straps
on
the
outfit
they
charged
thirty
cents
a
pound
to
carry
it
to
the
summit
of
chilcoot
and
it
nearly
broke
him
as
it
was
some
four
hundred
pounds
of
and
camp
outfit
was
not
handled
he
remained
behind
to
move
it
along
dispatching
kit
with
the
indians
at
the
summit
kit
was
to
remain
slowly
moving
his
ton
until
overtaken
by
the
four
hundred
pounds
with
which
his
uncle
guaranteed
to
catch
him
kit
plodded
along
the
trail
with
his
indian
packers
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
it
was
to
be
a
long
pack
straight
to
the
top
of
chilcoot
his
own
load
was
only
eighty
pounds
the
indians
plodded
under
their
loads
but
it
was
a
quicker
gait
than
he
had
practised
yet
he
felt
no
apprehension
and
by
now
had
come
to
deem
himself
almost
the
equal
of
an
indian
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
he
desired
to
rest
but
the
indians
kept
on
he
stayed
with
them
and
kept
his
place
in
the
line
at
the
half
mile
he
was
convinced
that
he
was
incapable
of
another
step
yet
he
gritted
his
teeth
kept
his
place
and
at
the
end
of
the
mile
was
amazed
that
he
was
still
alive
then
in
some
strange
way
came
the
thing
called
second
wind
and
the
next
mile
was
almost
easier
than
the
first
the
third
mile
nearly
killed
him
and
though
half
delirious
with
pain
and
fatigue
he
never
whimpered
and
then
when
he
felt
he
must
surely
faint
came
the
rest
instead
of
sitting
in
the
straps
as
was
the
custom
of
the
white
packers
the
indians
slipped
out
of
the
and
and
lay
at
ease
talking
and
smoking
a
full
half
hour
passed
before
they
made
another
start
to
kit
surprise
he
found
himself
a
fresh
man
and
hauls
and
long
rests
became
his
newest
motto
the
pitch
of
chilcoot
was
all
he
had
heard
of
it
and
many
were
the
occasions
when
he
climbed
with
hands
as
well
as
feet
but
when
he
reached
the
crest
of
the
divide
in
the
thick
of
a
driving
it
was
in
the
company
of
his
indians
and
his
secret
pride
was
that
he
had
come
through
with
them
and
never
squealed
and
never
lagged
to
be
almost
as
good
as
an
indian
was
a
new
ambition
to
cherish
when
he
had
paid
off
the
indians
and
seen
them
depart
a
stormy
darkness
was
falling
and
he
was
left
alone
a
thousand
feet
above
timber
line
on
the
of
a
mountain
wet
to
the
waist
famished
and
exhausted
he
would
have
given
a
year
income
for
a
fire
and
a
cup
of
coffee
instead
he
ate
half
a
dozen
cold
and
crawled
into
the
folds
of
the
partly
unrolled
tent
as
he
dozed
off
he
had
time
only
for
one
fleeting
thought
and
he
grinned
with
vicious
pleasure
at
the
picture
of
john
bellew
in
the
days
to
follow
masculinely
his
four
hundred
pounds
up
chilcoot
as
for
himself
even
though
burdened
with
two
thousand
pounds
he
was
bound
down
the
hill
in
the
morning
stiff
from
his
labours
and
numb
with
the
frost
he
rolled
out
of
the
canvas
ate
a
couple
of
pounds
of
uncooked
bacon
buckled
the
straps
on
a
hundred
pounds
and
went
down
the
rocky
way
several
hundred
yards
beneath
the
trail
led
across
a
small
glacier
and
down
to
crater
lake
other
men
packed
across
the
glacier
all
that
day
he
dropped
his
packs
at
the
glacier
upper
edge
and
by
virtue
of
the
shortness
of
the
pack
he
put
his
straps
on
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
each
load
his
astonishment
at
being
able
to
do
it
never
abated
for
two
dollars
he
bought
from
an
indian
three
leathery
and
out
of
these
and
a
huge
quantity
of
raw
bacon
made
several
meals
unwashed
unwarmed
his
clothing
wet
with
sweat
he
slept
another
night
in
the
canvas
in
the
early
morning
he
spread
a
tarpaulin
on
the
ice
loaded
it
with
of
a
ton
and
started
to
pull
where
the
pitch
of
the
glacier
accelerated
his
load
likewise
accelerated
overran
him
scooped
him
in
on
top
and
ran
away
with
him
a
hundred
packers
bending
under
their
loads
stopped
to
watch
him
he
yelled
frantic
warnings
and
those
in
his
path
stumbled
and
staggered
clear
below
on
the
lower
edge
of
the
glacier
was
pitched
a
small
tent
which
seemed
leaping
toward
him
so
rapidly
did
it
grow
larger
he
left
the
beaten
track
where
the
packers
trail
swerved
to
the
left
and
struck
a
patch
of
fresh
snow
this
arose
about
him
in
frosty
smoke
while
it
reduced
his
speed
he
saw
the
tent
the
instant
he
struck
it
carrying
away
the
corner
guys
bursting
in
the
front
flaps
and
fetching
up
inside
still
on
top
of
the
tarpaulin
and
in
the
midst
of
his
the
tent
rocked
drunkenly
and
in
the
frosty
vapour
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
startled
young
woman
who
was
sitting
up
in
her
blankets
the
very
one
who
had
called
him
chechaquo
at
dyea
did
you
see
my
smoke
he
queried
cheerfully
she
regarded
him
with
disapproval
talk
about
your
magic
carpets
he
went
on
do
you
mind
removing
that
sack
from
my
foot
she
said
coldly
he
looked
and
lifted
his
weight
quickly
it
was
a
sack
it
was
my
elbow
pardon
me
the
information
did
not
perturb
her
and
her
coolness
was
a
challenge
it
was
a
mercy
you
did
not
overturn
the
stove
she
said
he
followed
her
glance
and
saw
a
stove
and
a
attended
by
a
young
squaw
he
sniffed
the
coffee
and
looked
back
to
the
girl
i
a
chechaquo
he
said
her
bored
expression
told
him
that
he
was
stating
the
obvious
but
he
was
unabashed
i
shed
my
he
added
then
she
recognized
him
and
her
eyes
lighted
i
never
thought
you
get
this
far
she
informed
him
again
and
greedily
he
sniffed
the
air
as
i
live
coffee
he
turned
and
directly
addressed
her
i
give
you
my
little
finger
cut
it
right
off
now
i
do
anything
i
be
your
slave
for
a
year
and
a
day
or
any
other
odd
time
if
you
give
me
a
cup
out
of
that
pot
and
over
the
coffee
he
gave
his
name
and
learned
hers
joy
gastell
also
he
learned
that
she
was
an
in
the
country
she
had
been
born
in
a
trading
post
on
the
great
slave
and
as
a
child
had
crossed
the
rockies
with
her
father
and
come
down
to
the
yukon
she
was
going
in
she
said
with
her
father
who
had
been
delayed
by
business
in
seattle
and
who
had
then
been
wrecked
on
the
chanter
and
carried
back
to
puget
sound
by
the
rescuing
steamer
in
view
of
the
fact
that
she
was
still
in
her
blankets
he
did
not
make
it
a
long
conversation
and
heroically
declining
a
second
cup
of
coffee
he
removed
himself
and
his
quarter
of
a
ton
of
baggage
from
her
tent
further
he
took
several
conclusions
away
with
him
she
had
a
fetching
name
and
fetching
eyes
could
not
be
more
than
twenty
or
or
her
father
must
be
french
she
had
a
will
of
her
own
and
temperament
to
burn
and
she
had
been
educated
elsewhere
than
on
the
frontier
vi
over
the
rocks
and
above
the
the
trail
ran
around
crater
lake
and
gained
the
rocky
defile
that
led
toward
happy
camp
and
the
first
scrub
pines
to
pack
his
heavy
outfit
around
would
take
days
of
toil
on
the
lake
was
a
canvas
boat
employed
in
freighting
two
trips
with
it
in
two
hours
would
see
him
and
his
ton
across
but
he
was
broke
and
the
ferryman
charged
forty
dollars
a
ton
you
got
a
my
friend
in
that
dinky
boat
kit
said
to
the
ferryman
do
you
want
another
show
me
was
the
answer
i
sell
it
to
you
for
the
price
of
ferrying
my
outfit
it
an
idea
not
patented
and
you
can
jump
the
deal
as
soon
as
i
tell
you
it
are
you
game
the
ferryman
said
he
was
and
kit
liked
his
looks
very
well
you
see
that
glacier
take
a
and
wade
into
it
in
a
day
you
can
have
a
decent
groove
from
top
to
bottom
see
the
point
the
chilcoot
and
crater
lake
consolidated
chute
corporation
limited
you
can
charge
fifty
cents
a
hundred
get
a
hundred
tons
a
day
and
have
no
work
to
do
but
collect
the
coin
two
hours
later
kit
ton
was
across
the
lake
and
he
had
gained
three
days
on
himself
and
when
john
bellew
overtook
him
he
was
well
along
toward
deep
lake
another
volcanic
pit
filled
with
glacial
water
vii
the
last
pack
from
long
lake
to
linderman
was
three
miles
and
the
trail
if
trail
it
could
be
called
rose
up
over
a
hogback
dropped
down
a
scramble
of
slippery
rocks
and
crossed
a
wide
stretch
of
swamp
john
bellew
remonstrated
when
he
saw
kit
arise
with
a
hundred
pounds
in
the
straps
and
pick
up
a
sack
of
flour
and
place
it
on
top
of
the
pack
against
the
back
of
his
neck
come
on
you
chunk
of
the
hard
kit
retorted
kick
in
on
your
fodder
and
your
one
suit
of
underclothes
but
john
bellew
shook
his
head
i
afraid
i
getting
old
christopher
you
only
do
you
realize
that
my
grandfather
sir
your
father
old
isaac
bellew
killed
a
man
with
his
fist
when
he
was
years
old
john
bellew
grinned
and
swallowed
his
medicine
avuncular
i
want
to
tell
you
something
important
i
was
raised
a
lord
fauntleroy
but
i
can
outpack
you
outwalk
you
put
you
on
your
back
or
lick
you
with
my
fists
right
now
john
bellew
thrust
out
his
hand
and
spoke
solemnly
christopher
my
boy
i
believe
you
can
do
it
i
believe
you
can
do
it
with
that
pack
on
your
back
at
the
same
time
you
made
good
boy
though
it
too
unthinkable
to
believe
kit
made
the
round
trip
of
the
last
pack
four
times
a
day
which
is
to
say
that
he
daily
covered
miles
of
mountain
climbing
twelve
miles
of
it
under
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
he
was
proud
hard
and
tired
but
in
splendid
physical
condition
he
ate
and
slept
as
he
had
never
eaten
and
slept
in
his
life
and
as
the
end
of
the
work
came
in
sight
he
was
almost
half
sorry
one
problem
bothered
him
he
had
learned
that
he
could
fall
with
a
hundredweight
on
his
back
and
survive
but
he
was
confident
if
he
fell
with
that
additional
fifty
pounds
across
the
back
of
his
neck
that
it
would
break
it
clean
each
trail
through
the
swamp
was
quickly
churned
bottomless
by
the
thousands
of
packers
who
were
compelled
continually
to
make
new
trails
it
was
while
pioneering
such
a
new
trail
that
he
solved
the
problem
of
the
extra
fifty
the
soft
lush
surface
gave
way
under
him
he
floundered
and
pitched
forward
on
his
face
the
fifty
pounds
crushed
his
face
in
the
mud
and
went
clear
without
snapping
his
neck
with
the
remaining
hundred
pounds
on
his
back
he
arose
on
hands
and
knees
but
he
got
no
farther
one
arm
sank
to
the
shoulder
pillowing
his
cheek
in
the
slush
as
he
drew
this
arm
clear
the
other
sank
to
the
shoulder
in
this
position
it
was
impossible
to
slip
the
straps
and
the
hundredweight
on
his
back
would
not
let
him
rise
on
hands
and
knees
sinking
first
one
arm
and
then
the
other
he
made
an
effort
to
crawl
to
where
the
small
sack
of
flour
had
fallen
but
he
exhausted
himself
without
advancing
and
so
churned
and
broke
the
grass
surface
that
a
tiny
pool
of
water
began
to
form
in
perilous
proximity
to
his
mouth
and
nose
he
tried
to
throw
himself
on
his
back
with
the
pack
underneath
but
this
resulted
in
sinking
both
arms
to
the
shoulders
and
gave
him
a
foretaste
of
drowning
with
exquisite
patience
he
slowly
withdrew
one
sucking
arm
and
then
the
other
and
rested
them
flat
on
the
surface
for
the
support
of
his
chin
then
he
began
to
call
for
help
after
a
time
he
heard
the
sound
of
feet
sucking
through
the
mud
as
some
one
advanced
from
behind
lend
a
hand
friend
he
said
throw
out
a
or
something
it
was
a
woman
voice
that
answered
and
he
recognized
it
if
you
unbuckle
the
straps
i
can
get
up
the
hundred
pounds
rolled
into
the
mud
with
a
soggy
noise
and
he
slowly
gained
his
feet
a
pretty
predicament
miss
gastell
laughed
at
sight
of
his
face
not
at
all
he
replied
airily
my
favourite
physical
exercise
stunt
try
it
some
time
it
great
for
the
pectoral
muscles
and
the
spine
he
wiped
his
face
flinging
the
slush
from
his
hand
with
a
snappy
jerk
oh
she
cried
in
recognition
it
mr
ah
mr
smoke
bellew
i
thank
you
gravely
for
your
timely
rescue
and
for
that
name
he
answered
i
have
been
doubly
baptized
henceforth
i
shall
insist
always
on
being
called
smoke
bellew
it
is
a
strong
name
and
not
without
significance
he
paused
and
then
voice
and
expression
became
suddenly
fierce
do
you
know
what
i
going
to
do
he
demanded
i
going
back
to
the
states
i
am
going
to
get
married
i
am
going
to
raise
a
large
family
of
children
and
then
as
the
evening
shadows
fall
i
shall
gather
those
children
about
me
and
relate
the
sufferings
and
hardships
i
endured
on
the
chilcoot
trail
and
if
they
do
cry
i
repeat
if
they
do
cry
i
lambaste
the
stuffing
out
of
them
viii
the
arctic
winter
came
down
apace
snow
that
had
come
to
stay
lay
six
inches
on
the
ground
and
the
ice
was
forming
in
quiet
ponds
despite
the
fierce
gales
that
blew
it
was
in
the
late
afternoon
during
a
lull
in
such
a
gale
that
kit
and
john
bellew
helped
the
cousins
load
the
boat
and
watched
it
disappear
down
the
lake
in
a
and
now
a
night
sleep
and
an
early
start
in
the
morning
said
john
bellew
if
we
are
at
the
summit
we
make
dyea
night
and
if
we
have
luck
in
catching
a
steamer
we
be
in
san
francisco
in
a
week
enjoyed
your
vacation
kit
asked
absently
their
camp
for
that
last
night
at
linderman
was
a
melancholy
remnant
everything
of
use
including
the
tent
had
been
taken
by
the
cousins
a
tattered
tarpaulin
stretched
as
a
partially
sheltered
them
from
the
driving
snow
supper
they
cooked
on
an
open
fire
in
a
couple
of
battered
and
discarded
camp
utensils
all
that
was
left
them
were
their
blankets
and
food
for
several
meals
from
the
moment
of
the
departure
of
the
boat
kit
had
become
absent
and
restless
his
uncle
noticed
his
condition
and
attributed
it
to
the
fact
that
the
end
of
the
hard
toil
had
come
only
once
during
supper
did
kit
speak
avuncular
he
said
relevant
of
nothing
after
this
i
wish
call
me
smoke
i
made
some
smoke
on
this
trail
have
i
a
few
minutes
later
he
wandered
away
in
the
direction
of
the
village
of
tents
that
sheltered
the
who
were
still
packing
or
building
their
boats
he
was
gone
several
hours
and
when
he
returned
and
slipped
into
his
blankets
john
bellew
was
asleep
in
the
darkness
of
a
morning
kit
crawled
out
built
a
fire
in
his
stocking
feet
by
which
he
thawed
out
his
frozen
shoes
then
boiled
coffee
and
fried
bacon
it
was
a
chilly
miserable
meal
as
soon
as
finished
they
strapped
their
blankets
as
john
bellew
turned
to
lead
the
way
toward
the
chilcoot
trail
kit
held
out
his
hand
avuncular
he
said
john
bellew
looked
at
him
and
swore
in
his
surprise
do
forget
my
name
smoke
kit
chided
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
kit
waved
his
hand
in
a
general
direction
northward
over
the
lake
what
the
good
of
turning
back
after
getting
this
far
he
asked
besides
i
got
my
taste
of
meat
and
i

going
on

protested
john
bellew

with
a
couple
of
dudes
and
another
man
boatman
and
general
hustler
and
and
the
billow
can
go
to
hell
but
john
bellew
was
dazed
and
could
only
mutter
i
do
understand
they
say
the
baldface
grizzlies
are
thick
in
the
yukon
basin
kit
explained
well
i
got
only
one
suit
of
underclothes
and
going
after
the
that
all
the
meat
i
half
the
time
the
wind
blew
a
gale
and
smoke
bellew
staggered
against
it
along
the
beach
in
the
gray
of
dawn
a
dozen
boats
were
being
loaded
with
the
precious
outfits
packed
across
chilcoot
they
were
clumsy
boats
put
together
by
men
who
were
not
out
of
planks
they
had
sawed
by
hand
from
green
spruce
trees
one
boat
already
loaded
was
just
starting
and
kit
paused
to
watch
the
wind
which
was
fair
down
the
lake
here
blew
in
squarely
on
the
beach
kicking
up
a
nasty
sea
in
the
shallows
the
men
of
the
departing
boat
waded
in
high
rubber
boots
as
they
shoved
it
out
toward
deeper
water
twice
they
did
this
clambering
aboard
and
failing
to
row
clear
the
boat
was
swept
back
and
grounded
kit
noticed
that
the
spray
on
the
sides
of
the
boat
quickly
turned
to
ice
the
third
attempt
was
a
partial
success
the
last
two
men
to
climb
in
were
wet
to
their
waists
but
the
boat
was
afloat
they
struggled
awkwardly
at
the
heavy
oars
and
slowly
worked
off
shore
then
they
hoisted
a
sail
made
of
blankets
had
it
carried
away
in
a
gust
and
were
swept
a
third
time
back
on
the
freezing
beach
kit
grinned
to
himself
and
went
on
this
was
what
he
must
expect
to
encounter
for
he
too
in
his
new
role
of
gentleman
man
was
to
start
from
the
beach
in
a
similar
boat
that
very
day
everywhere
men
were
at
work
and
at
work
desperately
for
the
closing
down
of
winter
was
so
imminent
that
it
was
a
gamble
whether
or
not
they
would
get
across
the
great
chain
of
lakes
before
the
yet
when
kit
arrived
at
the
tent
of
messrs
sprague
and
stine
he
did
not
find
them
stirring
by
a
fire
under
the
shelter
of
a
tarpaulin
squatted
a
short
thick
man
smoking
a
cigarette
hello
he
said
are
you
mister
sprague
new
man
as
kit
nodded
he
thought
he
had
noted
a
shade
of
emphasis
on
the
mister
and
the
man
and
he
was
sure
of
a
hint
of
a
twinkle
in
the
corner
of
the
eye
well
i
doc
stine
man
the
other
went
on
i
five
feet
two
inches
long
and
my
name
shorty
jack
short
for
short
and
sometimes
known
as
kit
put
out
his
hand
and
shook
were
you
raised
on
he
queried
sure
was
the
answer
though
my
first
feedin
was
as
near
as
i
can
remember
sit
down
an
have
some
grub
the
bosses
turned
out
yet
and
despite
the
one
breakfast
kit
sat
down
under
the
tarpaulin
and
ate
a
second
breakfast
thrice
as
hearty
the
heavy
purging
toil
of
weeks
had
given
him
the
stomach
and
appetite
of
a
wolf
he
could
eat
anything
in
any
quantity
and
be
unaware
that
he
possessed
a
digestion
shorty
he
found
voluble
and
pessimistic
and
from
him
he
received
surprising
tips
concerning
their
bosses
and
ominous
forecasts
of
the
expedition
thomas
stanley
sprague
was
a
budding
mining
engineer
and
the
son
of
a
millionaire
doctor
adolph
stine
was
also
the
son
of
a
wealthy
father
and
through
their
fathers
both
had
been
backed
by
an
investing
syndicate
in
the
klondike
adventure
oh
they
sure
made
of
money
shorty
expounded
when
they
hit
the
beach
at
dyea
freight
was
seventy
cents
but
no
indians
there
was
a
party
from
eastern
oregon
real
miners
that
managed
to
get
a
team
of
indians
together
at
seventy
cents
indians
had
the
straps
on
the
outfit
three
thousand
pounds
of
it
when
along
comes
sprague
and
stine
they
offered
eighty
cents
and
ninety
and
at
a
dollar
a
pound
the
indians
jumped
the
contract
and
took
off
their
straps
sprague
and
stine
came
through
though
it
cost
them
three
thousand
and
the
oregon
bunch
is
still
on
the
beach
they
wo
get
through
till
next
year
oh
they
are
real
hummers
your
boss
and
mine
when
it
comes
to
sheddin
the
mazuma
an
never
mindin
other
folks
feelin
what
did
they
do
when
they
hit
linderman
the
carpenters
was
just
putting
in
the
last
licks
on
a
boat
they
contracted
to
a
bunch
for
six
hundred
sprague
and
stine
slipped
an
even
thousand
and
they
jumped
their
contract
it
a
boat
but
it
jiggered
the
other
bunch
they
got
their
outfit
right
here
but
no
boat
and
they
stuck
for
next
year
have
another
cup
of
coffee
and
take
it
from
me
that
i
would
travel
with
no
such
outfit
if
i
did
want
to
get
to
klondike
so
blamed
bad
they
ai
hearted
right
they
take
the
crape
off
the
door
of
a
house
in
mourning
if
they
needed
it
in
their
business
did
you
sign
a
contract
kit
shook
his
head
then
i
sorry
for
you
pardner
they
ai
no
grub
in
the
country
and
they
drop
you
cold
as
soon
as
they
hit
dawson
men

going
to
starve
there
this
winter
they
agreed

began
verbal
shorty
snapped
him

name
pardner
call

said
kit
well

have
a
run
for
your
verbal
contract
just
the
same
this
is
a
plain
sample
of
what
to
expect
they
can
sure
shed
mazuma
but
they
ca
work
or
turn
out
of
bed
in
the
morning
we
should
have
been
loaded
and
started
an
hour
ago
it
you
an
me
for
the
big
work
pretty
soon
you
hear
shoutin
for
their
coffee
in
bed
mind
you
and
they
grown
men
what

about
boatin
on
the
water
i
a
cowman
and
a
prospector
but
i
sure
on
water
they
do
know
punkins
what
d
know
search
me
kit
answered
snuggling
in
closer
under
the
tarpaulin
as
the
snow
whirled
before
a
fiercer
gust
i
have
been
on
a
small
boat
since
a
boy
but
i
guess
we
can
learn
a
corner
of
the
tarpaulin
tore
loose
and
shorty
received
a
jet
of
driven
snow
down
the
back
of
his
neck
oh
we
can
learn
all
right
he
muttered
wrathfully
sure
we
can
a
child
can
learn
but
it
dollars
to
doughnuts
we
do
even
get
started
it
was
eight
when
the
call
for
coffee
came
from
the
tent
and
nearly
nine
before
the
two
employers
emerged
hello
said
sprague
a
young
man
of
time
we
made
a
start
shorty
you
and
here
he
glanced
interrogatively
at
kit
i
did
quite
catch
your
name
last
evening
smoke
well
shorty
you
and
mr
smoke
had
better
begin
loading
the
boat
plain
smoke
cut
out
the
mister
kit
suggested
sprague
nodded
curtly
and
strolled
away
among
the
tents
to
be
followed
by
doctor
stine
a
slender
pallid
young
man
shorty
looked
significantly
at
his
companion
over
a
ton
and
a
half
of
outfit
and
they
wo
lend
a
hand
see
i
guess
it
because
we
paid
to
do
the
work
kit
answered
cheerfully
and
we
might
as
well
buck
in
to
move
three
thousand
pounds
on
the
shoulders
a
hundred
yards
was
no
slight
task
and
to
do
it
in
half
a
gale
slushing
through
the
snow
in
heavy
rubber
boots
was
exhausting
in
addition
there
was
the
taking
down
of
the
tent
and
the
packing
of
small
camp
equipage
then
came
the
loading
as
the
boat
settled
it
had
to
be
shoved
farther
and
farther
out
increasing
the
distance
they
had
to
wade
by
two
it
had
all
been
accomplished
and
kit
despite
his
two
breakfasts
was
weak
with
the
faintness
of
hunger
his
knees
were
shaking
under
him
shorty
in
similar
predicament
foraged
through
the
pots
and
pans
and
drew
forth
a
big
pot
of
cold
boiled
beans
in
which
were
imbedded
large
chunks
of
bacon
there
was
only
one
spoon
a
one
and
they
dipped
turn
and
turn
about
into
the
pot
kit
was
filled
with
an
immense
certitude
that
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
tasted
anything
so
good
lord
man
he
mumbled
between
chews
i
never
knew
what
appetite
was
till
i
hit
the
trail
sprague
and
stine
arrived
in
the
midst
of
this
pleasant
occupation
what
the
delay
sprague
complained
are
we
ever
going
to
get
started
shorty
dipped
in
turn
and
passed
the
spoon
to
kit
nor
did
either
speak
till
the
pot
was
empty
and
the
bottom
scraped
of
course
we
ai
ben
doin
nothing
shorty
said
wiping
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
we
ai
ben
doin
nothing
at
all
and
of
course
you
ai
had
nothing
to
eat
it
was
sure
careless
of
me
yes
yes
stine
said
quickly
we
ate
at
one
of
the
tents
friends
of
ours
thought
so
shorty
grunted
but
now
that
you
finished
let
us
get
started
sprague
urged
there
the
boat
said
shorty
she
sure
loaded
now
just
how
might
you
be
goin
about
to
get
started
by
climbing
aboard
and
shoving
off
come
on
they
waded
out
and
the
employers
got
on
board
while
kit
and
shorty
shoved
clear
when
the
waves
lapped
the
tops
of
their
boots
they
clambered
in
the
other
two
men
were
not
prepared
with
the
oars
and
the
boat
swept
back
and
grounded
half
a
dozen
times
with
a
great
expenditure
of
energy
this
was
repeated
shorty
sat
down
disconsolately
on
the
gunwale
took
a
chew
of
tobacco
and
questioned
the
universe
while
kit
baled
the
boat
and
the
other
two
exchanged
unkind
remarks
if
you
take
my
orders
i
get
her
off
sprague
finally
said
the
attempt
was
well
intended
but
before
he
could
clamber
on
board
he
was
wet
to
the
waist
we
got
to
camp
and
build
a
fire
he
said
as
the
boat
grounded
again
i
freezing
do
be
afraid
of
a
wetting
stine
sneered
other
men
have
gone
off
wetter
than
you
now
i
going
to
take
her
out
this
time
it
was
he
who
got
the
wetting
and
who
announced
with
chattering
teeth
the
need
of
a
fire
a
little
splash
like
that
sprague
chattered
spitefully
we
go
on
shorty
dig
out
my
and
make
a
fire
the
other
commanded
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
sprague
cried
shorty
looked
from
one
to
the
other
expectorated
but
did
not
move
he
working
for
me
and
i
guess
he
obeys
my
orders
stine
retorted
shorty
take
that
bag
ashore
shorty
obeyed
and
sprague
shivered
in
the
boat
kit
having
received
no
orders
remained
inactive
glad
of
the
rest
a
boat
divided
against
itself
wo
float
he
soliloquized
what
that
sprague
snarled
at
him
talking
to
myself
habit
of
mine
he
answered
his
employer
favoured
him
with
a
hard
look
and
sulked
several
minutes
longer
then
he
surrendered
get
out
my
bag
smoke
he
ordered
and
lend
a
hand
with
that
fire
we
wo
get
off
till
the
morning
now
ii
next
day
the
gale
still
blew
lake
linderman
was
no
more
than
a
narrow
mountain
gorge
filled
with
water
sweeping
down
from
the
mountains
through
this
funnel
the
wind
was
irregular
blowing
great
guns
at
times
and
at
other
times
dwindling
to
a
strong
breeze
if
you
give
me
a
shot
at
it
i
think
i
can
get
her
off
kit
said
when
all
was
ready
for
the
start
what
do
you
know
about
it
stine
snapped
at
him
search
me
kit
answered
and
subsided
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
worked
for
wages
in
his
life
but
he
was
learning
the
discipline
of
it
fast
obediently
and
cheerfully
he
joined
in
various
vain
efforts
to
get
clear
of
the
beach
how
would
you
go
about
it
sprague
finally
at
him
sit
down
and
get
a
good
rest
till
a
lull
comes
in
the
wind
and
then
buck
in
for
all
we
worth
simple
as
the
idea
was
he
had
been
the
first
to
evolve
it
the
first
time
it
was
applied
it
worked
and
they
hoisted
a
blanket
to
the
mast
and
sped
down
the
lake
stine
and
sprague
immediately
became
cheerful
shorty
despite
his
chronic
pessimism
was
always
cheerful
and
kit
was
too
interested
to
be
otherwise
sprague
struggled
with
the
steering
sweep
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
looked
appealingly
at
kit
who
relieved
him
my
arms
are
fairly
broken
with
the
strain
of
it
sprague
muttered
apologetically
you
never
ate
did
you
kit
asked
sympathetically
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
oh
nothing
i
was
just
wondering
but
behind
his
employer
back
kit
caught
the
approving
grin
of
shorty
who
had
already
caught
the
whim
of
his
simile
kit
steered
the
length
of
linderman
displaying
an
aptitude
that
caused
both
young
men
of
money
and
disinclination
for
work
to
name
him
shorty
was
no
less
pleased
and
volunteered
to
continue
cooking
and
leave
the
boat
work
to
the
other
between
linderman
and
lake
bennet
was
a
portage
the
boat
lightly
loaded
was
lined
down
the
small
but
violent
connecting
stream
and
here
kit
learned
a
vast
deal
more
about
boats
and
water
but
when
it
came
to
packing
the
outfit
stine
and
sprague
disappeared
and
their
men
spent
two
days
of
toil
in
getting
the
outfit
across
and
this
was
the
history
of
many
miserable
days
of
the
trip
kit
and
shorty
working
to
exhaustion
while
their
masters
toiled
not
and
demanded
to
be
waited
upon
but
the
arctic
winter
continued
to
close
down
and
they
were
held
back
by
numerous
and
avoidable
delays
at
windy
arm
stine
arbitrarily
dispossessed
kit
of
the
and
within
the
hour
wrecked
the
boat
on
a
lee
shore
two
days
were
lost
here
in
making
repairs
and
the
morning
of
the
fresh
start
as
they
came
down
to
embark
on
stern
and
bow
in
large
letters
was
charcoaled
chechaquo
kit
grinned
at
the
appropriateness
of
the
invidious
word
huh
said
shorty
when
accused
by
stine
i
can
sure
read
and
spell
an
i
know
that
chechaquo
means
tenderfoot
but
my
education
never
went
high
enough
to
learn
me
to
spell
a
like
that
both
employers
looked
daggers
at
kit
for
the
insult
rankled
nor
did
he
mention
that
the
night
before
shorty
had
besought
him
for
the
spelling
of
that
particular
word
that
as
bad
as
your
slam
at
shorty
confided
later
kit
chuckled
along
with
the
continuous
discovery
of
his
own
powers
had
come
an
disapproval
of
the
two
masters
it
was
not
so
much
irritation
which
was
always
present
as
disgust
he
had
got
his
taste
of
the
meat
and
liked
it
but
they
were
teaching
him
how
not
to
eat
it
privily
he
thanked
god
that
he
was
not
made
as
they
he
came
to
dislike
them
to
a
degree
that
bordered
on
hatred
their
malingering
bothered
him
less
than
their
helpless
inefficiency
somewhere
in
him
old
isaac
bellew
and
all
the
rest
of
the
hardy
bellews
were
making
good
shorty
he
said
one
day
in
the
usual
delay
of
getting
started
i
could
almost
fetch
them
a
rap
over
the
head
with
an
oar
and
bury
them
in
the
river
same
here
shorty
agreed
they
not
and
they
sure
stink
iii
they
came
to
the
rapids
first
the
box
canyon
and
several
miles
below
the
white
horse
the
box
canyon
was
adequately
named
it
was
a
box
a
trap
once
in
it
the
only
way
out
was
through
on
either
side
arose
perpendicular
walls
of
rock
the
river
narrowed
to
a
fraction
of
its
width
and
roared
through
this
gloomy
passage
in
a
madness
of
motion
that
heaped
the
water
in
the
centre
into
a
ridge
fully
eight
feet
higher
than
at
the
rocky
sides
this
ridge
in
turn
was
crested
with
stiff
upstanding
waves
that
curled
over
yet
remained
each
in
its
unvarying
place
the
canyon
was
well
feared
for
it
had
collected
its
toll
of
dead
from
the
passing
tying
to
the
bank
above
where
lay
a
score
of
other
anxious
boats
kit
and
his
companions
went
ahead
on
foot
to
investigate
they
crept
to
the
brink
and
gazed
down
at
the
swirl
of
water
sprague
drew
back
shuddering
my
god
he
exclaimed
a
swimmer
has
a
chance
in
that
shorty
touched
kit
significantly
with
his
elbow
and
said
in
an
undertone
cold
feet
dollars
to
doughnuts
they
do
go
through
kit
scarcely
heard
from
the
beginning
of
the
boat
trip
he
had
been
learning
the
stubbornness
and
inconceivable
viciousness
of
the
elements
and
this
glimpse
of
what
was
below
him
acted
as
a
challenge
we
got
to
ride
that
ridge
he
said
if
we
get
off
of
it
hit
the
walls
and
never
know
what
hit
us
was
shorty
verdict
can
you
swim
smoke
i
wish
i
could
if
anything
went
wrong
in
there
that
what
i
say
a
stranger
standing
alongside
and
peering
down
into
the
canyon
said
mournfully
and
i
wish
i
were
through
it
i
would
sell
my
chance
to
go
through
kit
answered
he
spoke
honestly
but
it
was
with
the
idea
of
heartening
the
man
he
turned
to
go
back
to
the
boat
are
you
going
to
tackle
it
the
man
asked
kit
nodded
i
wish
i
could
get
the
courage
to
the
other
confessed
i
been
here
for
hours
the
longer
i
look
the
more
afraid
i
am
i
am
not
a
boatman
and
i
have
only
my
nephew
with
me
who
is
a
young
boy
and
my
wife
if
you
get
through
safely
will
you
run
my
boat
through
kit
looked
at
shorty
who
delayed
to
answer
he
got
his
wife
with
him
kit
suggested
nor
had
he
mistaken
his
man
sure
shorty
affirmed
it
was
just
that
i
was
stopping
to
think
about
i
knew
there
was
some
reason
i
ought
to
do
it
again
they
turned
to
go
but
sprague
and
stine
made
no
movement

sprague
called
to
him
i
er
he
hesitated
i
just
stay
here
and
watch
you
we
need
three
men
in
the
boat
two
at
the
oars
and
one
at
the
steering
sweep

said
quietly
sprague
looked
at
stine
i
damned
if
i

that
gentleman
if

afraid
to
stand
here
and
look
on
i
not
who
afraid
sprague
demanded
hotly
stine
retorted
in
kind
and
their
two
men
left
them
in
the
thick
of
a
squabble
we
can
do
without
them
kit
said
to
shorty
you
take
the
bow
with
a
paddle
and
i
handle
the
steering
sweep
all
you
have
to
do
is
just
to
keep
her
straight
once
we
started
you
wo
be
able
to
hear
me
so
just
keep
on
keeping
straight
they
cast
off
the
boat
and
worked
out
to
middle
in
the
quickening
current
from
the
canyon
came
an
roar
the
river
sucked
in
to
the
entrance
with
the
smoothness
of
molten
glass
and
here
as
the
darkening
walls
received
them
shorty
took
a
chew
of
tobacco
and
dipped
his
paddle
the
boat
leaped
on
the
first
crests
of
the
ridge
and
they
were
deafened
by
the
uproar
of
wild
water
that
reverberated
from
the
narrow
walls
and
multiplied
itself
they
were
with
flying
spray
at
times
kit
could
not
see
his
comrade
at
the
bow
it
was
only
a
matter
of
two
minutes
in
which
time
they
rode
the
ridge
of
a
mile
and
emerged
in
safety
and
tied
to
the
bank
in
the
eddy
below
shorty
emptied
his
mouth
of
tobacco
juice
he
had
forgotten
to
spit
and
spoke
that
was
he
exulted
the
real
say
we
want
a
few
did
we
smoke
i
do
mind
tellin
you
in
confidence
that
before
we
started
i
was
the
scaredest
man
this
side
of
the
now
i
a
come
on
an
we
run
that
other
boat
through
midway
back
on
foot
they
encountered
their
employers
who
had
watched
the
passage
from
above
there
comes
the
said
shorty
keep
to
iv
after
running
the
strangers
boat
through
whose
name
proved
to
be
breck
kit
and
shorty
met
his
wife
a
slender
girlish
woman
whose
blue
eyes
were
moist
with
gratitude
breck
himself
tried
to
hand
kit
fifty
dollars
and
then
attempted
it
on
shorty
stranger
was
the
latter
rejection
i
come
into
this
country
to
make
money
outa
the
ground
an
not
outa
my
fellow
critters
breck
rummaged
in
his
boat
and
produced
a
demijohn
of
whiskey
hand
half
went
out
to
it
and
stopped
abruptly
he
shook
his
head
there
that
blamed
white
horse
right
below
an
they
say
it
worse
than
the
box
i
reckon
i
do
dast
tackle
any
lightning
several
miles
below
they
ran
in
to
the
bank
and
all
four
walked
down
to
look
at
the
bad
water
the
river
which
was
a
succession
of
rapids
was
here
deflected
toward
the
right
bank
by
a
rocky
reef
the
whole
body
of
water
rushing
crookedly
into
the
narrow
passage
accelerated
its
speed
frightfully
and
was
upflung
unto
huge
waves
white
and
wrathful
this
was
the
dread
mane
of
the
white
horse
and
here
an
even
heavier
toll
of
dead
had
been
exacted
on
one
side
of
the
mane
was
a
corkscrew
and
and
on
the
opposite
side
was
the
big
whirlpool
to
go
through
the
mane
itself
must
be
ridden
this
plum
rips
the
strings
outa
the
box
shorty
concluded
as
they
watched
a
boat
took
the
head
of
the
rapids
above
it
was
a
large
boat
fully
thirty
feet
long
laden
with
several
tons
of
outfit
and
handled
by
six
men
before
it
reached
the
mane
it
was
plunging
and
leaping
at
times
almost
hidden
by
the
foam
and
spray
shorty
shot
a
slow
sidelong
glance
at
kit
and
said
she
fair
smoking
and
she
has
hit
the
worst
they
hauled
the
oars
in
there
she
takes
it
now
god
she
gone
no
there
she
is
big
as
the
boat
was
it
had
been
buried
from
sight
in
the
flying
smother
between
crests
the
next
moment
in
the
thick
of
the
mane
the
boat
leaped
up
a
crest
and
into
view
to
kit
amazement
he
saw
the
whole
long
bottom
clearly
outlined
the
boat
for
the
fraction
of
an
instant
was
in
the
air
the
men
sitting
idly
in
their
places
all
save
one
in
the
stern
who
stood
at
the
steering
sweep
then
came
the
downward
plunge
into
the
trough
and
a
second
disappearance
three
times
the
boat
leaped
and
buried
itself
then
those
on
the
bank
saw
its
nose
take
the
whirlpool
as
it
slipped
off
the
mane
the
steersman
vainly
opposing
with
his
full
weight
on
the
surrendered
to
the
whirlpool
and
helped
the
boat
to
take
the
circle
three
times
it
went
around
each
time
so
close
to
the
rocks
on
which
kit
and
shorty
stood
that
either
could
have
leaped
on
board
the
steersman
a
man
with
a
reddish
beard
of
recent
growth
waved
his
hand
to
them
the
only
way
out
of
the
whirlpool
was
by
the
mane
and
on
the
round
the
boat
entered
the
mane
obliquely
at
its
upper
end
possibly
out
of
fear
of
the
draw
of
the
whirlpool
the
steersman
did
not
attempt
to
straighten
out
quickly
enough
when
he
did
it
was
too
late
alternately
in
the
air
and
buried
the
boat
angled
the
mane
and
sucked
into
and
down
through
the
stiff
wall
of
the
corkscrew
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
a
hundred
feet
below
boxes
and
bales
began
to
float
up
then
appeared
the
bottom
of
the
boat
and
the
scattered
heads
of
six
men
two
managed
to
make
the
bank
in
the
eddy
below
the
others
were
drawn
under
and
the
general
flotsam
was
lost
to
view
borne
on
by
the
swift
current
around
the
bend
there
was
a
long
minute
of
silence
shorty
was
the
first
to
speak
come
on
he
said
we
might
as
well
tackle
it
my
feet
get
cold
if
i
stay
here
any
longer
we
smoke
some
kit
grinned
at
him
and
you
sure
earn
your
name
was
the
rejoinder
shorty
turned
to
their
employers
comin
he
queried
perhaps
the
roar
of
the
water
prevented
them
from
hearing
the
invitation
shorty
and
kit
tramped
back
through
a
foot
of
snow
to
the
head
of
the
rapids
and
cast
off
the
boat
kit
was
divided
between
two
impressions
one
of
the
caliber
of
his
comrade
which
served
as
a
spur
to
him
the
other
likewise
a
spur
was
the
knowledge
that
old
isaac
bellew
and
all
the
other
bellews
had
done
things
like
this
in
their
westward
march
of
empire
what
they
had
done
he
could
do
it
was
the
meat
the
strong
meat
and
he
knew
as
never
before
that
it
required
strong
men
to
eat
such
meat
you
sure
got
to
keep
the
top
of
the
ridge
shorty
shouted
at
him
the
plug
tobacco
lifting
to
his
mouth
as
the
boat
quickened
in
the
quickening
current
and
took
the
head
of
the
rapids
kit
nodded
swayed
his
strength
and
weight
tentatively
on
the
steering
oar
and
headed
the
boat
for
the
plunge
several
minutes
later
and
lying
against
the
bank
in
the
eddy
below
the
white
horse
shorty
spat
out
a
mouthful
of
tobacco
juice
and
shook
kit
hand
meat
meat
shorty
chanted
we
eat
it
raw
we
eat
it
alive
at
the
top
of
the
bank
they
met
breck
his
wife
stood
at
a
little
distance
kit
shook
his
hand
i
afraid
your
boat
ca
make
it
he
said
it
is
smaller
than
ours
and
a
bit
cranky
the
man
pulled
out
a
row
of
bills
i
give
you
each
a
hundred
if
you
run
it
through
kit
looked
out
and
up
the
tossing
mane
of
the
white
horse
a
long
gray
twilight
was
falling
it
was
turning
colder
and
the
landscape
seemed
taking
on
a
savage
bleakness
it
ai
that
shorty
was
saying
we
do
want
your
money
would
touch
it
nohow
but
my
pardner
is
the
real
meat
with
boats
and
when
he
says
yourn
ai
safe
i
reckon
he
knows
what
he
about
kit
nodded
affirmation
and
chanced
to
glance
at
mrs
breck
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
and
he
knew
that
if
ever
he
had
seen
prayer
in
a
woman
eyes
he
was
seeing
it
then
shorty
followed
his
gaze
and
saw
what
he
saw
they
looked
at
each
other
in
confusion
and
did
not
speak
moved
by
the
common
impulse
they
nodded
to
each
other
and
turned
to
the
trail
that
led
to
the
head
of
the
rapids
they
had
not
gone
a
hundred
yards
when
they
met
stine
and
sprague
coming
down
where
are
you
going
the
latter
demanded
to
fetch
that
other
boat
through
shorty
answered
no
you
not
it
getting
dark
you
two
are
going
to
pitch
camp
so
huge
was
kit
disgust
that
he
forebore
to
speak
he
got
his
wife
with
him
shorty
said
that
his
lookout
stine
contributed
and
smoke
and
mine
was
shorty
retort
i
forbid
you
sprague
said
harshly
smoke
if
you
go
another
step
i
discharge
you
and
you
too
shorty
stine
added
and
a
hell
of
a
pickle
you
be
in
with
us
fired
shorty
replied
how
you
get
your
blamed
boat
to
dawson
who
serve
you
coffee
in
your
blankets
and
manicure
your
come
on
smoke
they
do
dast
fire
us
besides
we
got
agreements
it
they
fire
us
they
got
to
divvy
up
grub
to
last
us
through
the
winter
barely
had
they
shoved
breck
boat
out
from
the
bank
and
caught
the
first
rough
water
when
the
waves
began
to
lap
aboard
they
were
small
waves
but
it
was
an
earnest
of
what
was
to
come
shorty
cast
back
a
quizzical
glance
as
he
gnawed
at
his
inevitable
plug
and
kit
felt
a
strange
rush
of
warmth
at
his
heart
for
this
man
who
could
swim
and
who
could
back
out
the
rapids
grew
stiffer
and
the
spray
began
to
fly
in
the
gathering
darkness
kit
glimpsed
the
mane
and
the
crooked
fling
of
the
current
into
it
he
worked
into
this
crooked
current
and
felt
a
glow
of
satisfaction
as
the
boat
hit
the
head
of
the
mane
squarely
in
the
middle
after
that
in
the
smother
leaping
and
burying
and
swamping
he
had
no
clear
impression
of
anything
save
that
he
swung
his
weight
on
the
steering
oar
and
wished
his
uncle
were
there
to
see
they
emerged
breathless
wet
through
and
filled
with
water
almost
to
the
gunwale
lighter
pieces
of
baggage
and
outfit
were
floating
inside
the
boat
a
few
careful
strokes
on
shorty
part
worked
the
boat
into
the
draw
of
the
eddy
and
the
eddy
did
the
rest
till
the
boat
softly
touched
against
the
bank
looking
down
from
above
was
mrs
breck
her
prayer
had
been
answered
and
the
tears
were
streaming
down
her
cheeks
you
boys
have
simply
got
to
take
the
money
breck
called
down
to
them
shorty
stood
up
slipped
and
sat
down
in
the
water
while
the
boat
dipped
one
gunwale
under
and
righted
again
damn
the
money
said
shorty
fetch
out
that
whiskey
now
that
over
i
getting
cold
feet
an
i
sure
likely
to
have
a
chill
in
the
morning
as
usual
they
were
among
the
last
of
the
boats
to
start
breck
despite
his
boating
inefficiency
and
with
only
his
wife
and
nephew
for
crew
had
broken
camp
loaded
his
boat
and
pulled
out
at
the
first
streak
of
day
but
there
was
no
hurry
in
stine
and
sprague
who
seemed
incapable
of
realizing
that
the
might
come
at
any
time
they
malingered
got
in
the
way
delayed
and
doubted
the
work
of
kit
and
shorty
i
sure
losing
my
respect
for
god
seein
as
he
must
them
two
mistakes
in
human
form
was
the
latter
blasphemous
way
of
expressing
his
disgust
well
you
the
real
goods
at
any
rate
kit
grinned
back
at
him
it
makes
me
respect
god
the
more
just
to
look
at
you
he
was
sure
goin
some
eh
was
shorty
fashion
of
overcoming
the
embarrassment
of
the
compliment
the
trail
by
water
crossed
lake
le
barge
here
was
no
fast
current
but
a
tideless
stretch
of
forty
miles
which
must
be
rowed
unless
a
fair
wind
blew
but
the
time
for
fair
wind
was
past
and
an
icy
gale
blew
in
their
teeth
out
of
the
north
this
made
a
rough
sea
against
which
it
was
almost
impossible
to
pull
the
boat
added
to
their
troubles
was
driving
snow
also
the
freezing
of
the
water
on
their
kept
one
man
occupied
in
chopping
it
off
with
a
hatchet
compelled
to
take
their
turn
at
the
oars
sprague
and
stine
patently
loafed
kit
had
learned
how
to
throw
his
weight
on
an
oar
but
he
noted
that
his
employers
made
a
seeming
of
throwing
their
weights
and
that
they
dipped
their
oars
at
a
cheating
angle
at
the
end
of
three
hours
sprague
pulled
his
oar
in
and
said
they
would
run
back
into
the
mouth
of
the
river
for
shelter
stine
seconded
him
and
the
several
miles
were
lost
a
second
day
and
a
third
the
same
fruitless
attempt
was
made
in
the
river
mouth
the
continually
arriving
boats
from
white
horse
made
a
flotilla
of
over
two
hundred
each
day
forty
or
fifty
arrived
and
only
two
or
three
won
to
the
short
of
the
lake
and
did
not
come
back
ice
was
now
forming
in
the
eddies
and
connecting
from
eddy
to
eddy
in
thin
lines
around
the
points
the
was
very
imminent
we
could
make
it
if
they
had
the
souls
of
clams
kit
told
shorty
as
they
dried
their
moccasins
by
the
fire
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
we
could
have
made
it
if
they
had
turned
back
another
hour
work
would
have
fetched
that
west
shore
they
they
babes
in
the
woods
sure
shorty
agreed
he
turned
his
moccasin
to
the
flame
and
debated
a
moment
look
here
smoke
it
hundreds
of
miles
to
dawson
if
we
do
want
to
freeze
in
here
we
got
to
do
something
what
d
say
kit
looked
at
him
and
waited
we
got
the
immortal
cinch
on
them
two
babes
shorty
expounded
they
can
give
orders
an
shed
mazuma
but
as
you
say
they
plum
babes
if
we
goin
to
dawson
we
got
to
take
charge
of
this
here
outfit
they
looked
at
each
other
it
a
go
said
kit
as
his
hand
went
out
in
ratification
in
the
morning
long
before
daylight
shorty
issued
his
call
come
on
he
roared
tumble
out
you
sleepers
here
your
coffee
kick
in
to
it
we
goin
to
make
a
start
grumbling
and
complaining
stine
and
sprague
were
forced
to
get
under
way
two
hours
earlier
than
ever
before
if
anything
the
gale
was
stiffer
and
in
a
short
time
every
man
face
was
iced
up
while
the
oars
were
heavy
with
ice
three
hours
they
struggled
and
four
one
man
steering
one
chopping
ice
two
toiling
at
the
oars
and
each
taking
his
various
turns
the
shore
loomed
nearer
and
nearer
the
gale
blew
even
harder
and
at
last
sprague
pulled
in
his
oar
in
token
of
surrender
shorty
sprang
to
it
though
his
relief
had
only
begun
chop
ice
he
said
handing
sprague
the
hatchet
but
what
the
use
the
other
whined
we
ca
make
it
going
to
turn
back
we
going
on
said
shorty
chop
ice
an
when
you
feel
better
you
can
spell
me
it
was
toil
but
they
gained
the
shore
only
to
find
it
composed
of
rocks
and
cliffs
with
no
place
to
land
i
told
you
so
sprague
whimpered
you
never
peeped
shorty
answered
we
going
back
nobody
spoke
and
kit
held
the
boat
into
the
seas
as
they
skirted
the
forbidding
shore
sometimes
they
gained
no
more
than
a
foot
to
the
stroke
and
there
were
times
when
two
or
three
strokes
no
more
than
enabled
them
to
hold
their
own
he
did
his
best
to
hearten
the
two
weaklings
he
pointed
out
that
the
boats
which
had
won
to
this
shore
had
never
come
back
perforce
he
argued
they
had
found
a
shelter
somewhere
ahead
another
hour
they
laboured
and
a
second
if
you
fellows
put
into
your
oars
some
of
that
coffee
you
swig
in
your
blankets
we
make
it
was
shorty
encouragement
you
just
goin
through
the
motions
an
not
pullin
a
pound
a
few
minutes
later
sprague
drew
in
his
oar
i
finished
he
said
and
there
were
tears
in
his
voice
so
are
the
rest
of
us
kit
answered
himself
ready
to
cry
or
to
commit
murder
so
great
was
his
exhaustion
but
we
going
on
just
the
same
we
going
back
turn
the
boat
around
shorty
if
he
wo
pull
take
that
oar
yourself
kit
commanded
sure
was
the
answer
he
can
chop
ice
but
sprague
refused
to
give
over
the
oar
stine
had
ceased
rowing
and
the
boat
was
drifting
backward
turn
around
smoke
sprague
ordered
and
kit
who
never
in
his
life
had
cursed
any
man
astonished
himself
i
see
you
in
hell
first
he
replied
take
hold
of
that
oar
and
pull
it
is
in
moments
of
exhaustion
that
men
lose
all
their
reserves
of
civilization
and
such
a
moment
had
come
each
man
had
reached
the
sprague
jerked
off
a
mitten
drew
his
revolver
and
turned
it
on
his
steersman
this
was
a
new
experience
to
kit
he
had
never
had
a
gun
presented
at
him
in
his
life
and
now
to
his
surprise
it
seemed
to
mean
nothing
at
all
it
was
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
if
you
do
put
that
gun
up
he
said
i
take
it
away
and
rap
you
over
the
knuckles
with
it
if
you
do
turn
the
boat
around
i
shoot
you
sprague
threatened
then
shorty
took
a
hand
he
ceased
chopping
ice
and
stood
up
behind
sprague
go
on
an
shoot
said
shorty
wiggling
the
hatchet
i
just
aching
for
a
chance
to
brain
you
go
on
an
start
the
festivities
this
is
mutiny
stine
broke
in
you
were
engaged
to
obey
orders
shorty
turned
on
him
oh
you
get
yours
as
soon
as
i
finish
with
your
pardner
you
little
snooper
you
sprague
kit
said
i
give
you
just
thirty
seconds
to
put
away
that
gun
and
get
that
oar
out
sprague
hesitated
gave
a
short
hysterical
laugh
put
the
revolver
away
and
bent
his
back
to
the
work
for
two
hours
more
inch
by
inch
they
fought
their
way
along
the
edge
of
the
foaming
rocks
until
kit
feared
he
had
made
a
mistake
and
then
when
on
the
verge
of
himself
turning
back
they
came
abreast
of
a
narrow
opening
not
twenty
feet
wide
which
led
into
a
inclosure
where
the
fiercest
gusts
scarcely
flawed
the
surface
it
was
the
haven
gained
by
the
boats
of
previous
days
they
landed
on
a
shelving
beach
and
the
two
employers
lay
in
collapse
in
the
boat
while
kit
and
shorty
pitched
the
tent
built
a
fire
and
started
the
cooking
what
a
snooper
shorty
kit
asked
blamed
if
i
know
was
the
answer
but
he
one
just
the
same
the
gale
which
had
been
dying
quickly
ceased
at
nightfall
and
it
came
on
clear
and
cold
a
cup
of
coffee
set
aside
to
cool
and
forgotten
a
few
minutes
later
was
found
coated
with
half
an
inch
of
ice
at
eight
when
sprague
and
stine
already
rolled
in
their
blankets
were
sleeping
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
kit
came
back
from
a
look
at
the
boat
it
the
shorty
he
announced
there
a
skin
of
ice
over
the
whole
pond
already
what
are
you
going
to
do
there
only
one
thing
the
lake
of
course
freezes
first
the
rapid
current
of
the
river
may
keep
it
open
for
days
this
time
any
boat
caught
in
lake
le
barge
remains
there
until
next
year
you
mean
we
got
to
get
out
now
kit
nodded
tumble
out
you
sleepers
was
shorty
answer
couched
in
a
roar
as
he
began
casting
off
the
of
the
tent
the
other
two
awoke
groaning
with
the
pain
of
stiffened
muscles
and
the
pain
of
rousing
from
exhausted
sleep
what
time
is
it
stine
asked
eight
it
dark
yet
was
the
objection
shorty
jerked
out
a
couple
of
and
the
tent
began
to
sag
it
not
morning
he
said
it
evening
come
on
the
freezin
we
got
to
get
acrost
stine
sat
up
his
face
bitter
and
wrathful
let
it
freeze
we
not
going
to
stir
all
right
said
shorty
we
goin
on
with
the
boat
you
were
engaged
to
take
you
to
dawson
shorty
caught
him
up
well
we
you
ai
we
he
punctuated
his
query
by
bringing
half
the
tent
down
on
top
of
them
they
broke
their
way
through
the
thin
ice
in
the
little
harbour
and
came
out
on
the
lake
where
the
water
heavy
and
glassy
froze
on
their
oars
with
every
stroke
the
water
soon
became
like
mush
clogging
the
stroke
of
the
oars
and
freezing
in
the
air
even
as
it
dripped
later
the
surface
began
to
form
a
skin
and
the
boat
proceeded
slower
and
slower
often
afterwards
when
kit
tried
to
remember
that
night
and
failed
to
bring
up
aught
but
nightmare
recollections
he
wondered
what
must
have
been
the
sufferings
of
stine
and
sprague
his
one
impression
of
himself
was
that
he
struggled
through
biting
frost
and
intolerable
exertion
for
a
thousand
years
more
or
less
morning
found
them
stationary
stine
complained
of
frosted
fingers
and
sprague
of
his
nose
while
the
pain
in
kit
cheeks
and
nose
told
him
that
he
too
had
been
touched
with
each
accretion
of
daylight
they
could
see
farther
and
far
as
they
could
see
was
icy
surface
the
water
of
the
lake
was
gone
a
hundred
yards
away
was
the
shore
of
the
north
end
shorty
insisted
that
it
was
the
opening
of
the
river
and
that
he
could
see
water
he
and
kit
alone
were
able
to
work
and
with
their
oars
they
broke
the
ice
and
forced
the
boat
along
and
at
the
last
gasp
of
their
strength
they
made
the
suck
of
the
rapid
river
one
look
back
showed
them
several
boats
which
had
fought
through
the
night
and
were
hopelessly
frozen
in
then
they
whirled
around
a
bend
in
a
current
running
six
miles
an
hour
vi
day
by
day
they
floated
down
the
swift
river
and
day
by
day
the
extended
farther
out
when
they
made
camp
at
nightfall
they
chopped
a
space
in
the
ice
in
which
to
lay
the
boat
and
carried
the
camp
outfit
hundreds
of
feet
to
shore
in
the
morning
they
chopped
the
boat
out
through
the
new
ice
and
caught
the
current
shorty
set
up
the
stove
in
the
boat
and
over
this
stine
and
sprague
hung
through
the
long
drifting
hours
they
had
surrendered
no
longer
gave
orders
and
their
one
desire
was
to
gain
dawson
shorty
pessimistic
indefatigable
and
joyous
at
frequent
intervals
roared
out
the
three
lines
of
the
first
stanza
of
a
song
he
had
forgotten
the
colder
it
got
the
oftener
he
sang
like
argus
of
the
ancient
times
we
leave
this
modern
greece
to
shear
the
golden
fleece
as
they
passed
the
mouths
of
the
hootalinqua
and
the
big
and
little
salmon
they
found
these
streams
throwing
into
the
main
yukon
this
gathered
about
the
boat
and
attached
itself
and
at
night
they
found
themselves
compelled
to
chop
the
boat
out
of
the
current
in
the
morning
they
chopped
the
boat
back
into
the
current
the
last
night
ashore
was
spent
between
the
mouths
of
the
white
river
and
the
stewart
at
daylight
they
found
the
yukon
half
a
mile
wide
running
white
from
bank
to
bank
shorty
cursed
the
universe
with
less
geniality
than
usual
and
looked
at
kit
we
be
the
last
boat
this
year
to
make
dawson
kit
said
but
they
ai
no
water
smoke
then
we
ride
the
ice
down
come
on
futilely
protesting
sprague
and
stine
were
bundled
on
board
for
half
an
hour
with
axes
kit
and
shorty
struggled
to
cut
a
way
into
the
swift
but
solid
stream
when
they
did
succeed
in
clearing
the
the
floating
ice
forced
the
boat
along
the
edge
for
a
hundred
yards
tearing
away
half
of
one
gunwale
and
making
a
partial
wreck
of
it
then
they
caught
the
current
at
the
lower
end
of
the
bend
that
flung
they
proceeded
to
work
farther
toward
the
middle
the
stream
was
no
longer
composed
of
but
of
hard
cakes
in
between
the
cakes
only
was
that
froze
solidly
as
they
looked
at
it
shoving
with
the
oars
against
the
cakes
sometimes
climbing
out
on
the
cakes
in
order
to
force
the
boat
along
after
an
hour
they
gained
the
middle
five
minutes
after
they
ceased
their
exertions
the
boat
was
frozen
in
the
whole
river
was
coagulating
as
it
ran
cake
froze
to
cake
until
at
last
the
boat
was
the
centre
of
a
cake
feet
in
diameter
sometimes
they
floated
sidewise
sometimes
while
gravity
tore
asunder
the
forming
fetters
in
the
moving
mass
only
to
be
manacled
by
ones
while
the
hours
passed
shorty
stoked
the
stove
cooked
meals
and
chanted
his
war
song
night
came
and
after
many
efforts
they
gave
up
the
attempt
to
force
the
boat
to
shore
and
through
the
darkness
they
swept
helplessly
onward
what
if
we
pass
dawson
shorty
queried
we
walk
back
kit
answered
if
we
not
crushed
in
a
jam
the
sky
was
clear
and
in
the
light
of
the
cold
leaping
stars
they
caught
occasional
glimpses
of
the
loom
of
mountains
on
either
hand
at
eleven
from
below
came
a
dull
grinding
roar
their
speed
began
to
diminish
and
cakes
of
ice
to
and
crash
and
smash
about
them
the
river
was
jamming
one
cake
forced
upward
slid
across
their
cake
and
carried
one
side
of
the
boat
away
it
did
not
sink
for
its
own
cake
still
upbore
it
but
in
a
whirl
they
saw
dark
water
show
for
an
instant
within
a
foot
of
them
then
all
movement
ceased
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
the
whole
river
picked
itself
up
and
began
to
move
this
continued
for
an
hour
when
again
it
was
brought
to
rest
by
a
jam
once
again
it
started
running
swiftly
and
savagely
with
a
great
grinding
then
they
saw
lights
ashore
and
when
abreast
gravity
and
the
yukon
surrendered
and
the
river
ceased
for
six
months
on
the
shore
at
dawson
curious
ones
gathered
to
watch
the
river
freeze
heard
from
out
of
the
darkness
the
of
shorty
like
argus
of
the
ancient
times
we
leave
this
modern
greece
to
shear
the
golden
fleece
vii
for
three
days
kit
and
shorty
laboured
carrying
the
ton
and
a
half
of
outfit
from
the
middle
of
the
river
to
the
stine
and
sprague
had
bought
on
the
hill
overlooking
dawson
this
work
finished
in
the
warm
cabin
as
twilight
was
falling
sprague
motioned
kit
to
him
outside
the

hands
clenched
and
for
the
moment
he
saw
red
both
men
shrank
away
from
him
he
had
never
struck
a
man
in
anger
in
his
life
and
he
felt
so
certain
of
his
ability
to
thrash
sprague
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
it
shorty
saw
his
trouble
and
interposed

half
an
hour
afterwards
shorty
appeared
at
the
elkhorn
from
his
bleeding
knuckles
and
the
skin
off
one
cheek
it
was
evident
that
he
had
given
stine
and
sprague
what
was
coming

he
chuckled
as
they
stood
at
the
bar

but
if
we

got
five
thousand
pounds
of
meat
six
weeks
from
now
i
sure
go
back
an
apologize
to
our
bosses
is
it
a
go
kit
hand
went
out
and
they
shook
then
he
faltered
i
do
know
anything
about
hunting
he
said
shorty
lifted
his
glass
but
you
a
sure
an
i
learn
you
the
stampede
to
squaw
creek
i
two
months
after
smoke
bellew
and
shorty
went
after
moose
for
a
grubstake
they
were
back
in
the
elkhorn
saloon
at
dawson
the
hunting
was
done
the
meat
hauled
in
and
sold
for
two
dollars
and
a
half
a
pound
and
between
them
they
possessed
three
thousand
dollars
in
gold
dust
and
a
good
team
of
dogs
they
had
played
in
luck
despite
the
fact
that
the
gold
rush
had
driven
the
game
a
hundred
miles
or
more
into
the
mountains
they
had
within
half
that
distance
bagged
four
moose
in
a
narrow
canyon
the
mystery
of
the
strayed
animals
was
no
greater
than
the
luck
of
their
killers
for
within
the
day
four
famished
indian
families
reporting
no
game
in
three
days
journey
back
camped
beside
them
meat
was
traded
for
starving
dogs
and
after
a
week
of
feeding
smoke
and
shorty
harnessed
the
animals
and
began
freighting
the
meat
to
the
eager
dawson
market
the
problem
of
the
two
men
now
was
to
turn
their
into
food
the
current
price
for
flour
and
beans
was
a
dollar
and
a
half
a
pound
but
the
difficulty
was
to
find
a
seller
dawson
was
in
the
throes
of
famine
hundreds
of
men
with
money
but
no
food
had
been
compelled
to
leave
the
country
many
had
gone
down
the
river
on
the
last
water
and
many
more
with
barely
enough
food
to
last
had
walked
the
six
hundred
miles
over
the
ice
to
dyea
smoke
met
shorty
in
the
warm
saloon
and
found
the
latter
jubilant
life
ai
no
punkins
without
whiskey
an
sweetenin
was
greeting
as
he
pulled
lumps
of
ice
from
his
thawing
moustache
and
flung
them
rattling
on
the
floor
an
i
sure
just
got
eighteen
pounds
of
that
same
sweetenin
the
geezer
only
charged
three
dollars
a
pound
for
it
what
luck
did
you
have
i
too
have
not
been
idle
smoke
answered
with
pride
i
bought
fifty
pounds
of
flour
and
there
a
man
up
on
adam
creek
says
let
me
have
fifty
pounds
more

they
sure
took
on
class
when
they
got
meat
to
get

against
the
grain

man
entered
through
the
double
his
face
lighted
at
sight
of
smoke
who
recognized
him
as
breck

man
whose
boat

as
they
emerged
smoke
drew
off
one
mitten
lighted
a
match
and
glanced
at
the
thermometer
that
hung
beside
the
door
he
his
naked
hand
hastily
as
if
the
frost
had
burnt
him
overhead
arched
the
flaming
aurora
borealis
while
from
all
dawson
arose
the
mournful
howling
of
thousands
of
what
did
it
say
breck
asked
sixty
below
kit
spat
experimentally
and
the
spittle
crackled
in
the
air

the
thermometer

the
time
an
hour
ago
it
was
only
do

back
cautiously
casting
anxious
eyes
about
in
fear
of
some
other
listener

in
on
the
other
side
the
yukon

the
third
after

ii
when
smoke
entered
the
little
cabin
on
the
hillside
back
of
dawson
he
heard
a
heavy
familiar
breathing
aw
go
to
bed
shorty
mumbled
as
smoke
shook
his
shoulder
i
not
on
the
night
shift
was
his
next
remark
as
the
rousing
hand
became
more
vigorous
tell
your
troubles
to
the
kick
into
your
clothes
smoke
said
we
got
to
stake
a
couple
of
claims

sat
up
and
started
to
explode
but
smoke
hand
covered
his
mouth
ssh
smoke
warned
it

big
strike

me
the
tip
shallow
bedrock
gold
from
the
down
come
on
we
sling
a
couple
of
light
packs
together
and
pull
out
shorty
eyes
closed
as
he
lapsed
back
into
sleep
the
next
moment
his
blankets
were
swept
off
him
if
you
do
want
them
i
do
smoke
explained
shorty
followed
the
blankets
and
began
to
dress
goin
to
take
the
dogs
he
asked
no

trail
up
the
creek
is
sure
to
be
unbroken
and
we

make
better
time
without
them
then
i
throw
a
meal
which
have
to
last
till
we
get
back
be
sure
you

some
and
a
candle
shorty
opened
the
door
felt
the
bite
of
the
cold
and
shrank
back
to
pull
down
his
and
mitten
his
hands
five
minutes
later
he
returned
sharply
rubbing
his
nose
smoke
i
sure
opposed
to
makin
this
stampede
it
colder
than
the
hinges
of
hell
a
thousand
years
before
the
first
fire
was
lighted
besides
it
friday
the
thirteenth
an
we
goin
to
trouble
as
the
sparks
fly
upward
with
small
stampeding
packs
on
their
backs
they
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
started
down
the
hill
the
display
of
the
aurora
borealis
had
ceased
and
only
the
stars
leaped
in
the
great
cold
and
by
their
uncertain
light
made
traps
for
the
feet
shorty
floundered
off
a
turn
of
the
trail
into
deep
snow
and
raised
his
voice
in
blessing
of
the
date
of
the
week
and
month
and
year
ca
you
keep
still
smoke
chided
leave
the
almanac
alone

by
the
time
they
reached
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
were
fairly
in
dawson
lights
were
springing
up
in
the
cabins
doors
were
slamming
and
from
behind
came
the
sound
of
many
moccasins
on
the
snow
again
shorty
delivered
himself
but
it
beats
hell
the
amount
of
mourners
there
is
they
passed
a
man
who
stood
by
the
path
and
was
calling
anxiously
in
a
low
voice
oh
charley
get
a
move
on
see
that
pack
on
his
back
smoke
the
graveyard
sure
a
long
ways
off
when
the
mourners
got
to
pack
their
blankets
by
the
time
they
reached
the
main
street
a
hundred
men
were
in
line
behind
them
and
while
they
sought
in
the
deceptive
starlight
for
the
trail
that
dipped
down
the
bank
to
the
river
more
men
could
be
heard
arriving
shorty
slipped
and
shot
down
the
chute
into
the
soft
snow
smoke
followed
knocking
him
over
as
he
was
rising
to
his
feet
i
found
it
first
he
gurgled
taking
off
his
mittens
to
shake
the
snow
out
of
the
gauntlets
the
next
moment
they
were
scrambling
wildly
out
of
the
way
of
the
hurtling
bodies
of
those
that
followed
at
the
time
of
the
a
jam
had
occurred
at
this
point
and
cakes
of
ice
were
in
confusion
after
several
hard
falls
smoke
drew
out
his
candle
and
lighted
it
those
in
the
rear
hailed
it
with
acclaim
in
the
windless
air
it
burned
easily
and
he
led
the
way
more
quickly
it
a
sure
stampede
shorty
decided
or
might
all
them
be
we
at
the
head
of
the
procession
at
any
rate
was
smoke
answer
oh

do

firefly
ahead
there
mebbe
all
fireflies
that
one
an
that
one
look
at
believe
me
they
is
whole
strings
of
processions
ahead
it
was
a
mile
across
the
jams
to
the
west
bank
of
the
yukon
and
candles
flickered
the
full
length
of
the
twisting
trail
behind
them
clear
to
the
top
of
the
bank
they
had
descended
were
more
candles
say
smoke
this
ai
no
stampede
it
a
they
must
be
a
thousand
men
ahead
of
us
an
ten
thousand
behind
now

to
your
uncle
my
medicine
good
when
i
get
a
hunch

we
in
wrong

this
stampede
let
turn
back
an
hit
the
sleep
you
better
save
your
breath
if
you
intend
to
keep
up
smoke
retorted
gruffly
huh
my
legs
is
short
but
i
slog
along
slack
at
the
knees
an
worry
my
muscles
none
an
i
can
sure
walk
every
piker
here
off
the
ice
and
smoke
knew
he
was
right
for
he
had
long
since
learned
his
comrade
phenomenal
walking
powers
i
been
holding
back
to
give
you
a
chance
smoke
jeered
an
i
plum
troddin
on
your
heels
if
you
ca
do
better
let
me
go
ahead
and
set
pace
smoke
quickened
and
was
soon
at
the
rear
of
the
nearest
bunch
of
stampeders
hike
along
you
smoke
the
other
urged
walk
over
them
unburied
dead
this
ai
no
funeral
hit
the
frost
like
you
was
somewheres
smoke
counted
eight
men
and
two
women
in
this
party
and
before
the
way
across
the
was
won
he
and
shorty
had
passed
another
party
twenty
strong
within
a
few
feet
of
the
west
bank
the
trail
swerved
to
the
south
emerging
from
the
jam
upon
smooth
ice
the
ice
however
was
buried
under
several
feet
of
fine
snow
through
this
the
ran
a
narrow
ribbon
of
packed
footing
barely
two
feet
in
width
on
either
side
one
sank
to
his
knees
and
deeper
in
the
snow
the
stampeders
they
overtook
were
reluctant
to
give
way
and
often
smoke
and
shorty
had
to
plunge
into
the
deep
snow
and
by
supreme
efforts
flounder
past
shorty
was
irrepressible
and
pessimistic
when
the
stampeders
resented
being
passed
he
retorted
in
kind
what
your
hurry
one
of
them
asked
what
yours
he
answered
a
stampede
come
down
from
indian
river
yesterday

where
away

shorty
answered
me
i
the
discoverer
of
squaw
creek
i
just
comin
back
from
recordin
so
as
to
see
no
blamed
chechaquo
jumps
my
claim
the
average
pace
of
the
stampeders
on
the
smooth
going
was
three
miles
and
a
half
an
hour
smoke
and
shorty
were
doing
four
and
a
half
though
sometimes
they
broke
into
short
runs
and
went
faster
i
going
to
travel
your
feet
clean
off
shorty
smoke
challenged
huh
i
can
hike
along
on
the

miles
long
somebody
goin
to
get
left
an
it
makes
a
noise
like
you
an
me
before
replying
smoke
let
out
an
unexpected
link
that
threw
shorty
half
a
dozen
feet
in
the
rear
if
you
saved
your
breath
and
kept
up
we
cut
down
a
few
of
that
thousand
he
chided
who
me
if
you
get
outa
the
way
i
show
you
a
pace
what
is
smoke
laughed
and
let
out
another
link
the
whole
aspect
of
the
adventure
had
changed
through
his
brain
was
running
a
phrase
of
the
mad
philosopher
the
transvaluation
of
values
in
truth
he
was
less
interested
in
staking
a
fortune
than
in
beating
shorty
after
all
he
concluded
it
was
the
reward
of
the
game
but
the
playing
of
it
that
counted
mind
and
muscle
and
stamina
and
soul
were
challenged
in
a
contest
with
this
shorty
a
man
who
had
never
opened
the
books
and
who
did
not
know
grand
opera
from
nor
an
epic
from
a
chilblain
shorty
i
got
you
skinned
to
death
i
reconstructed
every
cell
in
my
body
since
i
hit
the
beach
at
dyea
my
flesh
is
as
stringy
as
whipcords
and
as
bitter
and
mean
as
the
bite
of
a
rattlesnake
a
few
months
ago
i
have
patted
myself
on
the
back
to
write
such
words
but
i
could
have
written
them
i
had
to
live
them
first
and
now
that
i
living
them
there
no
need
to
write
them
i
the
real
bitter
stinging
goods
and
no
scrub
of
a
mountaineer
can
put
anything
over
on
me
without
getting
it
back
compound
now
you
go
ahead
and
set
pace
for
half
an
hour
do
your
worst
and
when
you
all
in
i
go
ahead
and
give
you
half
an
hour
of
the
real
worst
huh
shorty
sneered
genially
an
him
not
dry
behind
the
ears
yet
get
outa
the
way
an
let
your
father
show
you
some
goin
by
they
alternated
in
setting
pace
nor
did
they
talk
much
their
exertions
kept
them
warm
though
their
breath
froze
on
their
faces
from
lips
to
chin
so
intense
was
the
cold
that
they
almost
continually
rubbed
their
noses
and
cheeks
with
their
mittens
a
few
minutes
cessation
from
this
allowed
the
flesh
to
grow
numb
and
then
most
vigorous
rubbing
was
required
to
produce
the
burning
prickle
of
returning
circulation
often
they
thought
they
had
reached
the
lead
but
always
they
overtook
more
stampeders
who
had
started
before
them
occasionally
groups
of
men
attempted
to
swing
in
behind
to
their
pace
but
invariably
they
were
discouraged
after
a
mile
or
two
and
disappeared
in
the
darkness
to
the
rear
we
been
out
on
trail
all
winter
was
shorty
comment
an
them
geezers
soft
from
laying
around
their
cabins
has
the
nerve
to
think
they
can
keep
our
stride
now
if
they
was
real
it
be
different
if
there
one
thing
a
can
do
it
sure
walk
once
smoke
lighted
a
match
and
glanced
at
his
watch
he
never
repeated
it
for
so
quick
was
the
bite
of
the
frost
on
his
bared
hands
that
half
an
hour
passed
before
they
were
again
comfortable
four
he
said
as
he
pulled
on
his
mittens
and
already
passed
three
hundred

stranger
let
somebody
stampede
that

how
to
stampede
the
latter
was
addressed
to
a
man
evidently
exhausted
who
could
no
more
than
stumble
along
and
who
blocked
the
trail
this
and
one
other
were
the
only
men
they
encountered
for
they
were
very
near
to
the
head
of
the
stampede
nor
did
they
learn
till
afterwards
the
horrors
of
that
night
exhausted
men
sat
down
to
rest
by
the
way
and
failed
to
get
up
seven
were
frozen
to
death
while
scores
of
amputations
of
toes
feet
and
fingers
were
performed
in
the
dawson
hospitals
on
the
survivors
for
of
all
nights
for
a
stampede
the
one
to
squaw
creek
occurred
on
the
coldest
night
of
the
year
before
morning
the
spirit
thermometers
at
dawson
registered
seventy
degrees
below
zero
the
men
composing
the
stampede
with
few
exceptions
were
in
the
country
who
did
not
know
the
way
of
the
cold
the
other
man
they
found
a
few
minutes
later
revealed
by
a
streamer
of
aurora
borealis
that
shot
like
a
searchlight
from
horizon
to
zenith
he
was
sitting
on
a
piece
of
ice
beside
the
trail
hop
along
sister
mary
shorty
gaily
greeted
him
keep
movin
if
you
sit
there
you
freeze
stiff
the
man
made
no
response
and
they
stopped
to
investigate
stiff
as
a
poker
was
shorty
verdict
if
you
tumbled
him
over
he
break
see
if
he
breathing
smoke
said
as
with
bared
hands
he
sought
through
furs
and
woollens
for
the
man
heart
shorty
lifted
one
and
bent
to
the
iced
lips
nary
breathe
he
reported
nor
said
smoke
he
mittened
his
hand
and
beat
it
violently
for
a
minute
before
exposing
it
to
the
frost
to
strike
a
match
it
was
an
old
man
incontestably
dead
in
the
moment
of
illumination
they
saw
a
long
grey
beard
massed
with
ice
to
the
nose
cheeks
that
were
white
with
frost
and
closed
eyes
with
lashes
frozen
together
then
the
match
went
out
come
on
shorty
said
rubbing
his
ear
we
ca
do
nothing
for
the
old
geezer
an
i
sure
frosted
my
ear
now
all
the
blamed
peel
off
and
it
be
sore
for
a
week
a
few
minutes
later
when
a
flaming
ribbon
spilled
pulsating
fire
over
the
heavens
they
saw
on
the
ice
a
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
two
forms
beyond
for
a
mile
nothing
moved
they
leading
the
procession

said
as
darkness
fell
again
come
on
let
get
them
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
not
yet
having
overtaken
the
two
in
front
shorty
broke
into
a
run
if
we
catch
we
never
pass
he
panted
lord
what
a
pace
they
hittin
dollars
to
doughnuts
they
no
chechaquos
the
real
variety
you
can
stack
on
that
smoke
was
leading
when
they
finally
caught
up
and
he
was
glad
to
ease
to
a
walk
at
their
heels
almost
immediately
he
got
the
impression
that
the
one
nearer
him
was
a
woman
how
this
impression
came
he
could
not
tell
hooded
and
furred
the
dark
form
was
as
any
form
yet
there
was
a
haunting
sense
of
familiarity
about
it
he
waited
for
the
next
flame
of
the
aurora
and
by
its
light
saw
the
smallness
of
the
moccasined
feet
but
he
saw
more
the
walk
and
knew
it
for
the
unmistakable
walk
he
had
once
resolved
never
to
forget
she
a
sure
goer
shorty
confided
hoarsely
i
bet
it
an
indian
how
do
you
do
miss
gastell
smoke
addressed
how
do
you
do
she
answered
with
a
turn
of
the
head
and
a
quick
glance
it
too
dark
to
see
who
are
you
smoke
she
laughed
in
the
frost
and
he
was
certain
it
was
the
prettiest
laughter
he
had
ever
heard
and
have
you
married
and
raised
all
those
children
you
were
telling
me
about
before
he
could
retort
she
went
on
how
many
chechaquos
are
there
behind
several
thousand
i
imagine
we
passed
over
three
hundred
and
they
were
wasting
any
time
it
the
old
story
she
said
bitterly
the
get
in
on
the
rich
creeks
and
the
who
dared
and
suffered
and
made
this
country
get
nothing
made
this
discovery
on
squaw
creek
how
it
leaked
out
is
the
mystery
and
they
sent
word
up
to
all
the
on
sea
lion
but
it
ten
miles
farther
than
dawson
and
when
they
arrive
they
find
the
creek
staked
to
the
skyline
by
the
dawson
chechaquos
it
is
right
it
is
fair
such
perversity
of
luck
it
is
too
bad
smoke
sympathized
but
i
hanged
if
i
know
what
you
going
to
do
about
it
first
come
first
served
you
know
i
wish
i
could
do
something
she
flashed
back
at
him
i
like
to
see
them
all
freeze
on
the
trail
or
have
everything
terrible
happen
to
them
so
long
as
the
sea
lion
stampede
arrived
first
you
certainly
got
it
in
for
us
hard
he
laughed
it
is
that
she
said
quickly
man
by
man
i
know
the
crowd
from
sea
lion
and
they
are
men
they
starved
in
this
country
in
the
old
days
and
they
worked
like
giants
to
develop
it
i
went
through
the
hard
times
on
the
koyokuk
with
them
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
i
was
with
them
in
the
birch
creek
famine
and
in
the
forty
mile
famine
they
are
heroes
and
they
deserve
some
reward
and
yet
here
are
thousands
of
green
softlings
who
have
earned
the
right
to
stake
anything
miles
and
miles
ahead
of
them
and
now
if
you
forgive
my
tirade
i
save
my
breath
for
i
do
know
when
you
and
all
the
rest
may
try
to
pass
dad
and
me
no
further
talk
passed
between
joy
and
smoke
for
an
hour
or
so
though
he
noticed
that
for
a
time
she
and
her
father
talked
in
low
tones
i
know
now
shorty
told
smoke
he
old
louis
gastell
an
the
real
goods
that
must
be
his
kid
he
come
into
this
country
so
long
ago
they
ai
nobody
can
recollect
an
he
brought
the
girl
with
him
she
only
a
baby
him
an
beetles
was
tradin
partners
an
they
ran
the
first
dinkey
little
steamboat
up
the
koyokuk
i
do
think
we
try
to
pass
them
smoke
said
we
at
the
head
of
the
stampede
and
there
are
only
four
of
us
shorty
agreed
and
another
hour
of
silence
followed
during
which
they
swung
steadily
along
at
seven
the
blackness
was
broken
by
a
last
display
of
the
aurora
borealis
which
showed
to
the
west
a
broad
opening
between
mountains
squaw
creek
joy
exclaimed
goin
some
shorty
exulted
we
ought
to
ben
there
for
another
half
hour
to
the
least
accordin
to
my
reckonin
i
must
a
ben
spreadin
my
legs
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
dyea
trail
baffled
by
swerved
abruptly
across
the
yukon
to
the
east
bank
and
here
they
must
leave
the
trail
mount
the
jams
and
follow
a
dim
trail
but
slightly
packed
that
hovered
the
west
bank
louis
gastell
leading
slipped
in
the
darkness
on
the
rough
ice
and
sat
up
holding
his
ankle
in
both
his
hands
he
struggled
to
his
feet
and
went
on
but
at
a
slower
pace
and
with
a
perceptible
limp
after
a
few
minutes
he
abruptly
halted
it
no
use
he
said
to
his
daughter
i
sprained
a
tendon
you
go
ahead
and
stake
for
me
as
well
as
yourself
ca
we
do
something
smoke
asked
louis
gastell
shook
his
head
she
can
stake
two
claims
as
well
as
one
i
crawl
over
to
the
bank
start
a
fire
and
bandage
my
ankle
i
be
all
right
go
on
joy
stake
ours
above
the
discovery
claim
it
richer
higher
up
here
some
birch
bark
smoke
said
dividing
his
supply
equally
we
take
care
of
your
daughter
louis
gastell
laughed
harshly
thank
you
just
the
same
he
said
but
she
can
take
care
of
herself
follow
her
and
watch
her
do
you
mind
if
i
lead
she
asked
smoke
as
she
headed
on
i
know
this
country
better
than
you
lead
on
smoke
answered
gallantly
though
i
agree
with
you
it
a
darned
shame
all
us
chechaquos
are
going
to
beat
that
sea
lion
bunch
to
it
is
there
some
way
to
shake
them
she
shook
her
head
we
ca
hide
our
trail
and
they
follow
it
like
sheep
after
a
quarter
of
a
mile
she
turned
sharply
to
the
west
smoke
noticed
that
they
were
going
through
unpacked
snow
but
neither
he
nor
shorty
observed
that
the
dim
trail
they
had
been
on
still
led
south
had
they
witnessed
the
subsequent
procedure
of
louis
gastell
the
history
of
the
klondike
would
have
been
written
differently
for
they
would
have
seen
that
no
longer
limping
running
with
his
nose
to
the
trail
like
a
hound
following
them
also
they
would
have
seen
him
trample
and
widen
the
turn
they
had
made
to
the
west
and
finally
they
would
have
seen
him
keep
on
the
old
dim
trail
that
still
led
south
a
trail
did
run
up
the
creek
but
so
slight
was
it
that
they
continually
lost
it
in
the
darkness
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
joy
gastell
was
willing
to
drop
into
the
rear
and
let
the
two
men
take
turns
in
breaking
a
way
through
the
snow
this
slowness
of
the
leaders
enabled
the
whole
stampede
to
catch
up
and
when
daylight
came
at
nine
as
far
back
as
they
could
see
was
an
unbroken
line
of
men
joy
dark
eyes
sparkled
at
the
sight
how
long
since
we
started
up
the
creek
she
asked
fully
two
hours
smoke
answered
and
two
hours
back
makes
four
she
laughed
the
stampede
from
sea
lion
is
saved
a
faint
suspicion
crossed
smoke
mind
and
he
stopped
and
confronted
her
i
do
understand
he
said
you
do
then
i
tell
you
this
is
norway
creek
squaw
creek
is
the
next
to
the
south
smoke
was
for
the
moment
speechless
you
did
it
on
purpose
shorty
demanded
i
did
it
to
give
the
a
chance
she
laughed
mockingly
the
men
grinned
at
each
other
and
finally
joined
her
i
lay
you
across
my
knee
an
give
you
a
wallopin
if
womenfolk
was
so
scarce
in
this
country
shorty
assured
her
your
father
did
sprain
a
tendon
but
waited
till
we
were
out
of
sight
and
then
went
on
smoke
asked
she
nodded
and
you
were
the
decoy
again
she
nodded
and
this
time
smoke
laughter
rang
out
clear
and
true
it
was
the
spontaneous
laughter
of
a
frankly
beaten
man
why
do
you
get
angry
with
me
she
queried
ruefully
or
or
wallop
me
well
we
might
as
well
be
starting
back
shorty
urged
my
gettin
cold
standin
here
smoke
shook
his
head
that
would
mean
four
hours
lost
we
must
be
eight
miles
up
this
creek
now
and
from
the
look
ahead
norway
is
making
a
long
swing
south
we
follow
it
then
cross
over
the
divide
somehow
and
tap
squaw
creek
somewhere
above
discovery
he
looked
at
joy
wo
you
come
along
with
us
i
told
your
father
we
look
after
you
i
she
hesitated
i
think
i
shall
if
you
do
mind
she
was
looking
straight
at
him
and
her
face
was
no
longer
defiant
and
mocking
really
mr
smoke
you
make
me
almost
sorry
for
what
i
have
done
but
somebody
had
to
save
the
it
strikes
me
that
stampeding
is
at
best
a
sporting
proposition
and
it
strikes
me
you
two
are
very
game
about
it
she
went
on
then
added
with
the
shadow
of
a
sigh
what
a
pity
you
are
not
for
two
hours
more
they
kept
to
the
frozen
of
norway
then
turned
into
a
narrow
and
rugged
tributary
that
flowed
from
the
south
at
midday
they
began
the
ascent
of
the
divide
itself
behind
them
looking
down
and
back
they
could
see
the
long
line
of
stampeders
breaking
up
here
and
there
in
scores
of
places
thin
advertised
the
making
of
camps
as
for
themselves
the
going
was
hard
they
wallowed
through
snow
to
their
waists
and
were
compelled
to
stop
every
few
yards
to
breathe
shorty
was
the
first
to
call
a
halt
we
ben
hittin
the
trail
for
over
twelve
hours
he
said
smoke
plum
willin
to
say
i
good
an
tired
an
so
are
you
an
i
free
to
shout
that
i
can
sure
hang
on
to
this
here
pascar
like
a
indian
to
a
hunk
of
but
this
poor
girl
here
ca
keep
her
legs
no
time
if
she
do
get
something
in
her
stomach
here
where
we
build
a
fire
what
d
say
so
quickly
so
deftly
and
methodically
did
they
go
about
making
a
temporary
camp
that
joy
watching
with
jealous
eyes
admitted
to
herself
that
the
could
not
do
it
better
spruce
boughs
with
a
spread
blanket
on
top
gave
a
foundation
for
rest
and
cooking
operations
but
they
kept
away
from
the
heat
of
the
fire
until
noses
and
cheeks
had
been
rubbed
cruelly
smoke
spat
in
the
air
and
the
resultant
crackle
was
so
immediate
and
loud
that
he
shook
his
head
i
give
it
up
he
said
i
never
seen
cold
like
this
one
winter
on
the
koyokuk
it
went
to
below
joy
answered
it
at
least
seventy
or
right
now
and
i
know
frosted
my
cheeks
they
burning
like
fire
on
the
steep
slope
of
the
divide
there
was
no
ice
while
snow
as
fine
and
hard
and
crystalline
as
granulated
sugar
was
poured
into
the
by
the
bushel
until
enough
water
was
melted
for
the
coffee
smoke
fried
bacon
and
thawed
biscuits
shorty
kept
the
fuel
supplied
and
tended
the
fire
and
joy
set
the
simple
table
composed
of
two
plates
two
cups
two
spoons
a
tin
of
mixed
salt
and
pepper
and
a
tin
of
sugar
when
it
came
to
eating
she
and
smoke
shared
one
set
between
them
they
ate
out
of
the
same
plate
and
drank
from
the
same
cup
it
was
nearly
two
in
the
afternoon
when
they
cleared
the
crest
of
the
divide
and
began
dropping
down
a
feeder
of
squaw
creek
earlier
in
the
winter
some
had
made
a
trail
up
the
canyon
that
is
in
going
up
and
down
he
had
stepped
always
in
his
previous
tracks
as
a
result
in
the
midst
of
soft
snow
and
veiled
under
later
snow
falls
was
a
line
of
irregular
hummocks
if
one
foot
missed
a
hummock
he
plunged
down
through
unpacked
snow
and
usually
to
a
fall
also
the
had
been
an
exceptionally
individual
joy
who
was
eager
now
that
the
two
men
should
stake
and
fearing
that
they
were
slackening
pace
on
account
of
her
evident
weariness
insisted
on
taking
the
lead
the
speed
and
manner
in
which
she
negotiated
the
precarious
footing
called
out
shorty
unqualified
approval
look
at
her
he
cried
she
the
real
goods
an
the
red
meat
look
at
them
moccasins
swing
along
no
there
she
uses
the
legs
god
gave
her
she
the
right
squaw
for
any
she
flashed
back
a
smile
of
acknowledgment
that
included
smoke
he
caught
a
feeling
of
chumminess
though
at
the
same
time
he
was
bitingly
aware
that
it
was
very
much
of
a
woman
who
embraced
him
in
that
comradely
smile
looking
back
as
they
came
to
the
bank
of
squaw
creek
they
could
see
the
stampede
strung
out
irregularly
struggling
along
the
descent
of
the
divide
they
slipped
down
the
bank
to
the
creek
bed
the
stream
frozen
solidly
to
bottom
was
from
twenty
to
thirty
feet
wide
and
ran
between
and
earth
banks
of
alluvial
no
recent
feet
had
disturbed
the
snow
that
lay
upon
its
ice
and
they
knew
they
were
above
the
discovery
claim
and
the
last
stakes
of
the
sea
lion
stampeders
look
out
for
springs
joy
warned
as
smoke
led
the
way
down
the
creek
at
seventy
below
you
lose
your
feet
if
you
break
through
these
springs
common
to
most
klondike
streams
never
ceased
at
the
lowest
temperatures
the
water
flowed
out
from
the
banks
and
lay
in
pools
which
were
cuddled
from
the
cold
by
later
and
snow
falls
thus
a
man
stepping
on
dry
snow
might
break
through
half
an
inch
of
and
find
himself
up
to
the
knees
in
water
in
five
minutes
unless
able
to
remove
the
wet
gear
the
loss
of
foot
was
the
penalty
though
only
three
in
the
afternoon
the
long
grey
twilight
of
the
arctic
had
settled
down
they
watched
for
a
blazed
tree
on
either
bank
which
would
show
the
of
the
last
claim
located
joy
impulsively
eager
was
the
first
to
find
it
she
darted
ahead
of
smoke
crying
somebody
been
here
see
the
snow
look
for
the
blaze
there
it
is
see
that
spruce
she
sank
suddenly
to
her
waist
in
the
snow
now
i
done
it
she
said
woefully
then
she
cried
do
come
near
me
i
wade
out
step
by
step
each
time
breaking
through
the
thin
skin
of
ice
concealed
under
the
dry
snow
she
forced
her
way
to
solid
footing
smoke
did
not
wait
but
sprang
to
the
bank
where
dry
and
seasoned
twigs
and
sticks
lodged
amongst
the
brush
by
spring
freshets
waited
the
match
by
the
time
she
reached
his
side
the
first
flames
and
flickers
of
an
assured
fire
were
rising
sit
down
he
commanded
she
obediently
sat
down
in
the
snow
he
slipped
his
pack
from
his
back
and
spread
a
blanket
for
her
feet
from
above
came
the
voices
of
the
stampeders
who
followed
them
let
shorty
stake
she
urged
go
on
shorty
smoke
said
as
he
attacked
her
moccasins
already
stiff
with
ice
pace
off
a
thousand
feet
and
place
the
two
we
can
fix
the
afterwards
with
his
knife
smoke
cut
away
the
lacings
and
leather
of
the
moccasins
so
stiff
were
they
with
ice
that
they
snapped
and
crackled
under
the
hacking
and
sawing
the
siwash
socks
and
heavy
woollen
stockings
were
sheaths
of
ice
it
was
as
if
her
feet
and
calves
were
encased
in
corrugated
iron
how
are
your
feet
he
asked
as
he
worked
pretty
numb
i
ca
move
nor
feel
my
toes
but
it
will
be
all
right
the
fire
is
burning
beautifully
watch
out
you
do
freeze
your
own
hands
they
must
be
numb
now
from
the
way
you
fumbling
he
slipped
his
mittens
on
and
for
nearly
a
minute
smashed
the
open
hands
savagely
against
his
sides
when
he
felt
the
he
pulled
off
the
mittens
and
ripped
and
tore
and
sawed
and
hacked
at
the
frozen
garments
the
white
skin
of
one
foot
appeared
then
that
of
the
other
to
be
exposed
to
the
bite
of
seventy
below
zero
which
is
the
equivalent
of
one
hundred
and
two
below
freezing
then
came
the
rubbing
with
snow
carried
on
with
an
intensity
of
cruel
fierceness
till
she
squirmed
and
shrank
and
moved
her
toes
and
joyously
complained
of
the
hurt
he
her
and
she
herself
nearer
to
the
fire
he
placed
her
feet
on
the
blanket
close
to
the
flames
you
have
to
take
care
of
them
for
a
while
he
said
she
could
now
safely
remove
her
mittens
and
manipulate
her
own
feet
with
the
wisdom
of
the
initiated
being
watchful
that
the
heat
of
the
fire
was
absorbed
slowly
while
she
did
this
he
attacked
his
hands
the
snow
did
not
melt
nor
moisten
its
light
crystals
were
like
so
much
sand
slowly
the
stings
and
pangs
of
circulation
came
back
into
the
chilled
flesh
then
he
tended
the
fire
unstrapped
the
light
pack
from
her
back
and
got
out
a
complete
change
of
shorty
returned
along
the
and
climbed
the
bank
to
them
i
sure
staked
a
full
thousan
feet
he
proclaimed
number
and
number
though
i
only
got
the
upper
stake
of
when
i
met
the
first
geezer
of
the
bunch
behind
he
just
straight
declared
i
was
goin
to
stake
an
i
told
him
yes
yes
joy
cried
what
did
you
tell
him
well
i
told
him
straight
that
if
he
did
back
up
plum
five
hundred
feet
i
sure
punch
his
frozen
nose
into
an
chocolate
eclaires
he
backed
up
an
i
got
in
the
of
two
full
an
honest
claims
he
staked
next
and
i
guess
by
now
the
bunch
has
squaw
creek
located
to
an
down
the
other
side
ourn
is
safe
it
too
dark
to
see
now
but
we
can
put
out
the
in
the
mornin
iii
when
they
awoke
they
found
a
change
had
taken
place
during
the
night
so
warm
was
it
that
shorty
and
smoke
still
in
their
mutual
blankets
estimated
the
temperature
at
no
more
than
twenty
below
the
cold
snap
had
broken
on
top
their
blankets
lay
six
inches
of
frost
crystals
good
morning
how
your
feet
was
smoke
greeting
across
the
ashes
of
the
fire
to
where
joy
gastell
carefully
shaking
aside
the
snow
was
sitting
up
in
her
sleeping
furs
shorty
built
the
fire
and
quarried
ice
from
the
creek
while
smoke
cooked
breakfast
daylight
came
on
as
they
finished
the
meal
you
go
an
fix
them
smoke
shorty
said
there
a
gravel
under
where
i
chopped
ice
for
the
coffee
an
i
goin
to
melt
water
and
wash
a
pan
of
that
same
gravel
for
luck
smoke
departed
axe
in
hand
to
blaze
the
stakes
starting
from
the
of
he
headed
at
right
angles
across
the
narrow
valley
towards
its
rim
he
proceeded
methodically
almost
automatically
for
his
mind
was
alive
with
recollections
of
the
night
before
he
felt
somehow
that
he
had
won
to
empery
over
the
delicate
lines
and
firm
muscles
of
those
feet
and
ankles
he
had
rubbed
with
snow
and
this
empery
seemed
to
extend
to
all
women
in
dim
and
fiery
ways
a
feeling
of
possession
mastered
him
it
seemed
that
all
that
was
necessary
was
for
him
to
walk
up
to
this
joy
gastell
take
her
hand
in
his
and
say
come
it
was
in
this
mood
that
he
discovered
something
that
made
him
forget
empery
over
the
white
feet
of
woman
at
the
valley
rim
he
blazed
no
he
did
not
reach
the
valley
rim
but
instead
he
found
himself
confronted
by
another
stream
he
lined
up
with
his
eye
a
blasted
willow
tree
and
a
big
and
recognizable
spruce
he
returned
to
the
stream
where
were
the
centre
stakes
he
followed
the
bed
of
the
creek
around
a
wide
horseshoe
bend
through
the
flat
and
found
that
the
two
creeks
were
the
same
creek
next
he
floundered
twice
through
the
snow
from
valley
rim
to
valley
rim
running
the
first
line
from
the
lower
stake
of
the
second
from
the
upper
stake
of
and
he
found
that
the
upper
stake
of
the
latter
was
lower
than
the
lower
stake
of
the
former
in
the
gray
twilight
and
shorty
had
located
their
two
claims
on
the
horseshoe
smoke
plodded
back
to
the
little
camp
shorty
at
the
end
of
washing
a
pan
of
gravel
exploded
at
sight
of
him
we
got
it
shorty
cried
holding
out
the
pan
look
at
it
a
nasty
mess
of
gold
two
hundred
right
there
if
it
a
cent
she
runs
rich
from
the
top
of
the
i
churned
around
placers
some
but
i
never
got
butter
like
what
in
this
pan
smoke
cast
an
incurious
glance
at
the
coarse
gold
poured
himself
a
cup
of
coffee
at
the
fire
and
sat
down
joy
sensed
something
wrong
and
looked
at
him
with
eagerly
solicitous
eyes
shorty
however
was
disgruntled
by
his
partner
lack
of
delight
in
the
discovery
why
do
you
kick
in
an
get
excited
he
demanded
we
got
our
pile
right
here
unless
you
stickin
up
your
nose
at
pans
smoke
took
a
swallow
of
coffee
before
replying
shorty
why
are
our
two
claims
here
like
the
panama
canal
what
the
answer
well
the
eastern
entrance
of
the
panama
canal
is
west
of
the
western
entrance
that
all
go
on
shorty
said
i
ai
seen
the
joke
yet
in
short
shorty
you
staked
our
two
claims
on
a
big
horseshoe
bend
shorty
set
the
gold
pan
down
in
the
snow
and
stood
up
go
on
he
repeated
the
upper
stake
of
is
ten
feet
below
the
lower
stake
of
you
mean
we
ai
got
nothin
smoke
worse
than
that
we
got
ten
feet
less
than
nothing
shorty
departed
down
the
bank
on
the
run
five
minutes
later
he
returned
in
response
to
joy
look
he
nodded
without
speech
he
went
over
to
a
log
and
sat
down
to
gaze
steadily
at
the
snow
in
front
of
his
moccasins
we
might
as
well
break
camp
and
start
back
for
dawson
smoke
said
beginning
to
fold
the
blankets
i
am
sorry
smoke
joy
said
it
all
my
fault
it
all
right
he
answered
all
in
the
day
work
you
know
but
it
my
fault
wholly
mine
she
persisted
dad
staked
for
me
down
near
discovery
i
know
i
give
you
my
claim
he
shook
his
head
shorty
she
pleaded
shorty
shook
his
head
and
began
to
laugh
it
was
a
colossal
laugh
chuckles
and
muffled
explosions
yielded
to
hearty
roars
it
ai
hysterics
he
explained
i
sure
get
powerful
amused
at
times
an
this
is
one
of
them
his
gaze
chanced
to
fall
on
the
gold
pan
he
walked
over
and
gravely
kicked
it
scattering
the
gold
over
the
landscape
it
ai
ourn
he
said
it
belongs
to
the
geezer
i
backed
up
five
hundred
feet
last
night
an
what
gets
me
is
four
hundred
an
ninety
of
them
feet
was
to
the
good
his
good
come
on
smoke
start
the
hike
to
dawson
though
if
you
hankerin
to
kill
me
i
wo
lift
a
finger
to
prevent
shorty
dreams
i
funny
you
do
gamble
none
shorty
said
to
smoke
one
night
in
the
elkhorn
ai
it
in
your
blood
it
is
smoke
answered
but
the
statistics
are
in
my
head
i
like
an
even
break
for
my
money
all
about
them
in
the
huge
arose
the
click
and
rattle
and
rumble
of
a
dozen
games
at
which
moccasined
men
tried
their
luck
smoke
waved
his
hand
to
include
them
all
look
at
them
he
said
it
cold
mathematics
that
they
will
lose
more
than
they
win
that
the
big
proportion
is
losing
right
now
you
sure
strong
on
figgers
shorty
murmured
admiringly
an
in
the
main
you
right
but
they
such
a
thing
as
facts
an
one
fact
is
streaks
of
luck
they
times
when
every
geezer
playin
wins
as
i
know
for
i
sat
in
in
such
games
an
saw
one
bank
busted
the
only
way
to
win
at
gamblin
is
wait
for
a
hunch
that
you
got
a
lucky
streak
comin
and
then
to
play
it
to
the
roof
it
sounds
simple
smoke
criticized
so
simple
i
ca
see
how
men
can
lose
the
trouble
is
shorty
admitted
that
most
men
gets
fooled
on
their
hunches
on
occasion
i
sure
get
fooled
on
mine
the
thing
is
to
try
an
find
out
smoke
shook
his
head
that
a
statistic
too
shorty
most
men
prove
wrong
on
their
hunches
but
do
you
ever
get
one
of
them
streaky
feelin
that
all
you
got
to
do
is
put
your
money
down
an
pick
a
winner
smoke
laughed
i
too
scared
of
the
percentage
against
me
but
i
tell
you
what
shorty
i
throw
a
dollar
on
the
card
right
now
and
see
if
it
will
buy
us
a
drink
smoke
was
edging
his
way
in
to
the
faro
table
when
shorty
caught
his
arm
hold
on
i
gettin
one
of
them
hunches
now
you
put
that
dollar
on
roulette
they
went
over
to
a
roulette
table
near
the
bar
wait
till
i
give
the
word
shorty
counselled
what
number
smoke
asked
pick
it
yourself
but
wait
till
i
say
let
her
go
you
do
mean
to
say
i
got
an
even
chance
on
that
table
smoke
argued
as
good
as
the
next
geezers
but
not
as
good
as
the
bank
wait
and
see
shorty
urged
now
let
her
go
the
had
just
sent
the
little
ivory
ball
whirling
around
the
smooth
rim
above
the
revolving
wheel
smoke
at
the
lower
end
of
the
table
reached
over
a
player
and
blindly
tossed
the
dollar
it
slid
along
the
smooth
green
cloth
and
stopped
fairly
in
the
centre
of
the
ball
came
to
rest
and
the
announced
wins
he
swept
the
table
and
alongside
of
smoke
dollar
stacked
dollars
smoke
drew
the
money
in
and
shorty
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
now
that
was
the
real
goods
of
a
hunch
smoke
how
i
know
it
there
no
tellin
i
just
knew
you
win
why
if
that
dollar
of
yourn
fell
on
any
other
number
it
won
just
the
same
when
the
hunch
is
right
you
just
ca
help
winnin
suppose
it
had
come
nought
smoke
queried
as
they
made
their
way
to
the
bar
then
your
dollar
ben
on
nought
was
shorty
answer
they
no
gettin
away
from
it
a
hunch
is
a
hunch
here
how
come
on
back
to
the
table
i
got
a
hunch
after
pickin
you
for
a
winner
that
i
can
pick
some
few
numbers
myself
are
you
playing
a
system
smoke
asked
at
the
end
of
ten
minutes
when
his
partner
had
dropped
a
hundred
dollars
shorty
shook
his
head
indignantly
as
he
spread
his
chips
out
in
the
vicinities
of
and
and
tossed
a
spare
chip
on
the
hell
is
sure
cluttered
with
geezers
that
played
systems
he
exposited
as
the
keeper
raked
the
table
from
idly
watching
smoke
became
fascinated
following
closely
every
detail
of
the
game
from
the
whirling
of
the
ball
to
the
making
and
the
paying
of
the
bets
he
made
no
plays
however
merely
contenting
himself
with
looking
on
yet
so
interested
was
he
that
shorty
announcing
that
he
had
had
enough
with
difficulty
drew
smoke
away
from
the
table
the
returned
shorty
the
gold
sack
he
had
deposited
as
a
credential
for
playing
and
with
it
went
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
was
scribbled
out
dollars
shorty
carried
the
sack
and
the
paper
across
the
room
and
handed
them
to
the
weigher
who
sat
behind
a
large
pair
of
out
of
shorty
sack
he
weighed
dollars
which
he
poured
into
the
coffer
of
the
house
that
hunch
of
yours
was
another
one
of
those
statistics
smoke
jeered
i
had
to
play
it
did
i
in
order
to
find
out
shorty
retorted
i
reckon
i
was
crowdin
some
just
on
account
of
tryin
to
convince
you
they
such
a
thing
as
hunches
never
mind
shorty
smoke
laughed
i
got
a
hunch
right
now
shorty
eyes
sparkled
as
he
cried
eagerly
what
is
it
kick
in
play
it
pronto
it
not
that
kind
shorty
now
what
i
got
is
a
hunch
that
some
day
i
work
out
a
system
that
will
beat
the
spots
off
that
table
system
shorty
groaned
then
surveyed
his
partner
with
a
vast
pity
smoke
listen
to
your
an
leave
system
alone
systems
is
sure
losers
they
ai
no
hunches
in
systems
that
why
i
like
them
smoke
answered
a
system
is
statistical
when
you
get
the
right
system
you
ca
lose
and
that
the
difference
between
it
and
a
hunch
you
never
know
when
the
right
hunch
is
going
wrong
but
i
know
a
lot
of
systems
that
went
wrong
an
i
never
seen
a
system
win
shorty
paused
and
sighed
look
here
smoke
if
you
cracked
on
systems
this
ai
no
place
for
you
an
it
about
time
we
hit
the
trail
again
ii
during
the
several
following
weeks
the
two
partners
played
at
cross
purposes
smoke
was
bent
on
spending
his
time
watching
the
roulette
game
in
the
elkhorn
while
shorty
was
equally
bent
on
travelling
trail
at
last
smoke
put
his
foot
down
when
a
stampede
was
proposed
for
two
hundred
miles
down
the
yukon
look
here
shorty
he
said
i
not
going
that
trip
will
take
ten
days
and
before
that
time
i
hope
to
have
my
system
in
proper
working
order
i
could
almost
win
with
it
now
what
are
you
dragging
me
around
the
country
this
way
for
anyway
smoke
i
got
to
take
care
of
you
was
shorty
reply
getting
nutty
i
drag
you
stampedin
to
jericho
or
the
north
pole
if
i
could
keep
you
away
from
that
table
it
all
right
shorty
but
just
remember
i
reached
full
size
the
only
dragging
you
do
will
be
dragging
home
the
dust
i
going
to
win
with
that
system
of
mine
and
you
most
likely
have
to
do
it
with
a
shorty
response
was
a
groan
and
i
do
want
you
to
be
bucking
any
games
on
your
own
smoke
went
on
we
going
to
divide
the
winnings
and
i
need
all
our
money
to
get
started
that
system
young
yet
and
it
liable
to
trip
me
for
a
few
falls
before
i
get
it
lined
up
iii
at
last
after
long
hours
and
days
spent
at
watching
the
table
the
night
came
when
smoke
proclaimed
he
was
ready
and
shorty
glum
and
pessimistic
with
all
the
seeming
of
one
attending
a
funeral
accompanied
his
partner
to
the
elkhorn
smoke
bought
a
stack
of
chips
and
stationed
himself
at
the
end
of
the
table
again
and
again
the
ball
was
whirled
and
the
other
players
won
or
lost
but
smoke
did
not
venture
a
chip
shorty
waxed
impatient
buck
in
buck
in
he
urged
let
get
this
funeral
over
the
matter
got
cold
feet
smoke
shook
his
head
and
waited
a
dozen
plays
went
by
and
then
suddenly
he
placed
ten
chips
on
the
number
won
and
the
keeper
paid
smoke
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
dozen
plays
went
by
twenty
plays
and
thirty
when
smoke
placed
ten
dollars
on
again
he
received
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
it
a
hunch
shorty
whispered
vociferously
in
his
ear
ride
it
ride
it
half
an
hour
went
by
during
which
smoke
was
inactive
then
he
placed
ten
dollars
on
and
won
a
hunch
shorty
whispered
nothing
of
the
sort
smoke
whispered
back
it
the
system
she
a
dandy
you
ca
tell
me
shorty
contended
hunches
comes
in
mighty
funny
ways
you
might
think
it
a
system
but
it
ai
systems
is
impossible
they
ca
happen
it
a
sure
hunch
you
playin
smoke
now
altered
his
play
he
bet
more
frequently
with
single
chips
scattered
here
and
there
and
he
lost
more
often
than
he
won
quit
it
shorty
advised

and
the

a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
during
which
smoke
won
and
lost
on
small
scattering
bets
then
with
the
abruptness
that
characterized
his
big
betting

placed
dollars
on
the

and
the
keeper
paid

eight
hundred
and
dollars
wake

shorty
moaned
smoke
smiled
consulted
his
and
became
absorbed
in
calculation
he
continually
drew
the
from
his
pocket
and
from
time
to
time
jotted
down
figures
a
crowd
had
packed
densely
around
the
table
while
the
players
themselves
were
attempting
to
cover
the
same
numbers
he
covered
it
was
then
that
a
change
came
over
his
play
ten
times
in
succession
he
placed
ten
dollars
on
and
lost
at
this
stage
he
was
deserted
by
the
hardiest
he
changed
his
number
and
won
another
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
immediately
the
players
were
back
with
him
deserting
again
after
a
series
of
losing
bets

i
going

answered
for
a
few
minutes
with
varying
luck

played
scattering
chips
over
the
table
and
then
dropped
dollars
on
the
nought
i
take
my
slip

he
said
to
the
dealer

he
won

the
agreement

pleaded
with
smoke
the
next
night
in
the
cabin
as
he
evidenced
preparations
to
return
to
the
elkhorn
you
played
a
mighty
long
string
of
hunches
but
you
played
it
out
if

your
winnings

when
they
entered
the
elkhorn
all
eyes
centred
on
smoke
and
those
about
the
table
made
way
for
him
as
he
took
up
his
old
place
at
the
keeper
end
his
play
was
quite
unlike
that
of
the
previous
night
in
the
course
of
an
hour
and
a
half
he
made
only
four
bets
but
each
bet
was
for
dollars
and
each
bet
won
he
cashed
in
hundred
dollars
and
shorty
carried
the
dust
home
to
the
cabin
now
the
time
to
jump
the
game
shorty
advised
as
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
bunk
and
took
off
his
moccasins
you
seven
ahead
a
man
a
fool
that
crowd
his

system
like
mine
smoke

upon

it
weighed
pounds
and
shorty
was
fully
aware
of
the
crush
of
its
impact
on
his
flesh
it
real
smoke
hammered
his
point
home
huh
i
saw

mighty
real

my
time
in
a

dollars
back
to
him

all
you
can

he
said
the
limit
come

gettin
picayune
shorty
sneered
no
one
has
to
play
at
this
table
that
do
want
to
the
keeper
retorted
and
i
willing
to
say
straight
out
in
meeting
that
sooner
your
pardner
did
play
at
our
table
scared
of
his
system
eh
shorty
challenged
as
the
keeper
paid
over
three
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
i
ai
saying
i
believe
in
system
because
i
do
there
never
was
a
system
that
beat
roulette
or
any
percentage
game
but
just
the
same
i
seen
some
queer
strings
of
luck
and
i
ai
going
to
let
this
bank
go
bust
if
i
can
help
it
cold
feet
gambling
is
just
as
much
business
my
friend
as
any
other
business
we
ai
philanthropists
night
by
night
smoke
continued
to
win
his
method
of
play
varied
expert
after
expert
in
the
jam
about
the
table
scribbled
down
his
bets
and
numbers
in
vain
attempts
to
work
out
his
system
they
complained
of
their
inability
to
get
a
clew
to
start
with
and
swore
that
it
was
pure
luck
though
the
most
colossal
streak
of
it
they
had
ever
seen
it
was
smoke
varied
play
that
obfuscated
them
sometimes
consulting
his
or
engaging
in
long
calculations
an
hour
elapsed
without
his
staking
a
chip
at
other
times
he
would
win
three
and
clean
up
a
thousand
dollars
and
odd
in
five
or
ten
minutes
at
still
other
times
his
tactics
would
be
to
scatter
single
chips
prodigally
and
amazingly
over
the
table
this
would
continue
for
from
ten
to
thirty
minutes
of
play
when
abruptly
as
the
ball
whirled
through
the
last
few
of
its
circles
he
would
play
the
limit
on
column
colour
and
number
and
win
all
three
once
to
complete
confusion
in
the
minds
of
those
that
strove
to
divine
his
secret
he
lost
forty
straight
bets
each
at
the
limit
but
each
night
play
no
matter
how
diversely
shorty
carried
home
hundred
dollars
for
him
it
ai
no
system
shorty
expounded
at
one
of
their
discussions
i
follow
you
an
follow
you
but
they
ai
no
figgerin
it
out
you
never
play
twice
the
same
all
you
do
is
pick
winners
when
you
want
to
an
when
you
do
want
to
you
just
on
purpose
do
maybe
you
nearer
right
than
you
think
shorty
i
just
got
to
pick
losers
sometimes
it
part
of
the
system
system
hell
i
talked
with
every
gambler
in
town
an
the
last
one
is
agreed
they
ai
no
such
thing
as
system
yet
i
showing
them
one
all
the
time
look
here
smoke
shorty
paused
over
the
candle
in
the
act
of
blowing
it
out
i
real
irritated
maybe
you
think
this
is
a
candle

winners
that
all
why

the
keeper
demanded
wrathfully
because
i
like
this
one
smoke
glanced
over
to
the
roaring
stove
only
a
few
feet
away
besides
there
are
no
draughts
here
and
it
is
warm
and
comfortable
on
the
ninth
night

vii
the
next
morning
a
visitor
came
to
the
cabin
smoke
knew
him
harvey
moran
the
owner
of
all
the
games
in
the
tivoli
there
was
a
note
of
appeal
in
his
deep
gruff
voice
as
he
plunged
into
his
business
it
like
this
smoke
he
began
you
got
us
all
guessing
representing
nine
other
and
myself
from
all
the
saloons
in
town
we
do
understand
we
know
that
no
system
ever
worked
against
roulette
all
the
mathematic
sharps
in
the
colleges
have
told
us
gamblers
the
same
thing
they
say
that
roulette
itself
is
the
system
the
one
and
only
system
and
therefore
that
no
system
can
beat
it
for
that
would
mean
arithmetic
has
gone
shorty
nodded
his
head
violently
if
a
system
can
beat
a
system
then
there
no
such
thing
as
system
the
gambler
went
on
in
such
a
case
anything
could
be
possible
a
thing
could
be
in
two
different
places
at
once
or
two
things
could
be
in
the
same
place
that
only
large
enough
for
one
at
the
same
time
well
you
seen
me
play
smoke
answered
defiantly
and
if
you
think
it
only
a
string
of
luck
on
my
part
why
worry
that
the
trouble
we
ca
help
worrying
it
a
system
got
and
all
the
time
we
know
it
ca
be
i
watched
you
five
nights
now
and
all
i
can
make
out
is
that
you
favour
certain
numbers
and
keep
on
winning
now
the
ten
of
us
have
got
together
and
we
want
to
make
a
friendly
proposition
we
put
a
roulette
table
in
a
back
room
of
the
elkhorn
pool
the
bank
against
you
and
have
you
buck
us
it
will
be
all
quiet
and
private
just
you
and
shorty
and
us
what
do
you
say
i
think
it
the
other
way
around
smoke
answered
it
up
to
you
to
come
and
see
me
i
be
playing
in
the
of
the
elkhorn
you
can
watch
me
there
just
as
well
viii
that
night
when
smoke
took
up
his
customary
place
at
the
table
the
keeper
shut
down
the
game
the
game
closed
he
said
boss
orders
but
the
assembled
were
not
to
be
balked
in
a
few
minutes
they
arranged
a
pool
each
putting
in
a
thousand
and
took
over
the
table
come
on
and
buck
us
harvey
moran
challenged
as
the
keeper
sent
the
ball
on
its
first
whirl
around
give
me
the
limit
smoke
suggested

immediately
placed
chips
on
the
nought
and
won
moran
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
go
on
he
said
we
got
ten
thousand
in
this
bank
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
a
half
the
ten
thousand
was
smoke
the
bank

the
keeper
announced
got
enough
smoke
asked
the
looked
at
one
another
they
were
awed
they
the
fatted
proteges
of
the
laws
of
chance
were
undone
they
were
up
against
one
who
had
more
intimate
access
to
those
laws
or
who
had
invoked
higher
and
undreamed
laws
we
quit
moran
said
ai
that
right
burke
big
burke
who
owned
the
games

or
to
ten
cents
or
a
cent
he
wo

in
a
night
with
such
stakes

shrugged
his
shoulders
in
that
case

gang
of
men
to
play
at
all
your
tables

shift
and
make
money
then
we
shut
down
our
tables
big
burke
replied
unless
he
hesitated
and
ran
his
eye
over
his
fellows
to
see
that
they
were
with
him
unless
you
willing
to
talk
business
what
will
you
sell
the
system
for
thirty
thousand
dollars
smoke
answered
that
a
tax
of
three
thousand
apiece
they
debated
and
nodded
and
you

and
you
promise
not
to
play

too
blamed
expensive
to
open
my
eyes
roll
out
of
the
blankets
an
start
breakfast
what
your
system
big
burke
demanded
we
paid
for
it
and
we
want
it
smoke
led
the
way
to
the
table
now
gentlemen
bear
with
me
a
moment
this
is
an
ordinary
system
it
can
scarcely
be
called
legitimate
but
its
one
great
virtue
is
that
it
works
i
got
my
suspicious
but
i
not
saying
anything
you
watch
mr
keeper
be
ready
with
the
ball
wait
i
am
going
to
pick
consider
i
bet
on
it
be
ready
mr
keeper
now
the
ball
whirled
around
you
observe
smoke
went
on
that
was
directly
opposite
the
ball
finished
in
big
burke
swore
deep
in
his
chest
and
all
waited
for
nought
to
win
must
be
opposite
try
it
yourself
and
see
but
the
system
moran
demanded
impatiently
we
know
you
can
pick
winning
numbers
and
we
know
what
those
numbers
are
but
how
do
you
do
it
by
observed
sequences
by
accident
i
chanced
twice
to
notice
the
ball
whirled
when
was
opposite
both
times
won
after
that
i
saw
it
happen
again
then
i
looked
for
other
sequences
and
found
them
nought
opposite
fetches
and
fetches
nought
it
does
always
happen
but
it
usually
happens
you
notice
i
say
as
i
said
before
i
have
my
suspicions
but
i
not
saying
anything
big
burke
with
a
sudden
dawn
of
comprehension
reached
over
stopped
the
wheel
and
examined
it
carefully
the
heads
of
the
nine
other
bent
over
and
joined
in
the
examination
big
burke
straightened
up
and
cast
a
glance
at
the
stove
hell
he
said
it
was
any
system
at
all
the
table
stood
close
to
the
fire
and
the
blamed
wheel
warped
and
we
been
worked
to
a
frazzle
no
wonder
he
liked
this
table
he
could
have
bucked
for
sour
apples
at
any
other
table
harvey
moran
gave
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
wiped
his
forehead
well
anyway
he
said
it
cheap
at
the
price
just
to
find
out
that
it
was
a
system
his
face
began
to
work
and
then
he
broke
into
laughter
and
slapped
smoke
on
the
shoulder
smoke
you
had
us
going
for
a
while
and
we
patting
ourselves
on
the
back
because
you
were
letting
our
tables
alone
say
i
got
some
real
fizz
i
open
if
all
you
come
over
to
the
tivoli
with
me
later
back
in
the
cabin
shorty
silently
overhauled
and
hefted
the
various
bulging
he
finally
piled
them
on
the
table
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
his
bunk
and
began
taking
off
his
moccasins
seventy
thousan
he
calculated
it
weighs
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
all
out
of
a
warped
wheel
an
a
quick
eye
smoke
you
eat
raw
you
eat
alive
you
work
under
water
you
given
me
the
but
just
the
same
i
know
it
a
dream
it
only
in
dreams
that
the
good
things

true
i
almighty
unanxious
to
wake
up
i
hope
i
never
wake
up
cheer
up
smoke
answered
you
wo
there
are
a
lot
of
philosophy
sharps
that
think
men
are
you
in
good
company
shorty
got
up
went
to
the
table
selected
the
heaviest
sack
and
cuddled
it
in
his
arms
as
if
it
were
a
baby
i
may
be
he
said
but
as
you
say
i
sure
in
mighty
good
company
the
man
on
the
other
bank
i
it
was
before
smoke
bellew
staked
the
farcical
of
made
the
historic
corner
of
eggs
that
nearly
broke
swiftwater
bank
account
or
won
the
race
down
the
yukon
for
an
even
million
dollars
that
he
and
shorty
parted
company
on
the
upper
klondike
shorty
task
was
to
return
down
the
klondike
to
dawson
to
record
some
claims
they
had
staked
smoke
with
the
turned
south
his
quest
was
surprise
lake
and
the
mythical
two
cabins
his
traverse
was
to
cut
the
headwaters
of
the
indian
river
and
cross
the
unknown
region
over
the
mountains
to
the
stewart
river
here
somewhere
rumour
persisted
was
surprise
lake
surrounded
by
jagged
mountains
and
glaciers
its
bottom
paved
with
raw
gold
it
was
said
whose
very
names
were
forgotten
in
the
forests
of
earlier
years
had
dived
in
the
of
surprise
lake
and
fetched
to
the
surface
in
both
hands
at
different
times
parties
of
had
penetrated
the
forbidding
fastness
and
sampled
the
lake
golden
bottom
but
the
water
was
too
cold
some
died
in
the
water
being
pulled
up
dead
others
died
of
consumption
and
one
who
had
gone
down
never
did
come
up
all
survivors
had
planned
to
return
and
drain
the
lake
yet
none
had
ever
gone
back
disaster
always
happened
one
man
fell
into
an
below
forty
mile
another
was
killed
and
eaten
by
his
dogs
a
third
was
crushed
by
a
falling
tree
and
so
the
tale
ran
surprise
lake
was
a
hoodoo
its
location
was
unremembered
and
the
gold
still
paved
its
undrained
bottom
two
cabins
no
less
mythical
was
more
definitely
located
sleeps
up
the
mcquestion
river
from
the
stewart
stood
two
ancient
cabins
so
ancient
were
they
that
they
must
have
been
built
before
ever
the
first
known
had
entered
the
yukon
basin
wandering
whom
even
smoke
had
met
and
talked
with
claimed
to
have
found
the
two
cabins
in
the
old
days
but
to
have
sought
vainly
for
the
mine
which
those
early
adventurers
must
have
worked
i
wish
you
was
goin
with
me
shorty
said
wistfully
at
parting
just
because
you
got
the
indian
bug
ai
no
reason
for
to
go
into
trouble
they
no
gettin
away
from
it
that
loco
country
you
bound
for
the
hoodoo
sure
on
it
from
the
first
flip
to
the
last
call
judgin
from
all
you
an
me
has
hearn
tell
about
it
it
all
right
shorty
i
make
the
round
trip
and
be
back
in
dawson
in
six
weeks
the
yukon
trail
is
packed
and
the
first
hundred
miles
or
so
of
the
stewart
ought
to
be
packed
from
henderson
have
told
me
a
number
of
outfits
went
up
last
fall
after
the
when
i
strike
their
trail
i
ought
to
hit
her
up
forty
or
fifty
miles
a
day
i
likely
to
be
back
inside
a
month
once
i
get
across
yes
once
you
get
acrost
but
it
the
gettin
acrost
that
worries
me
well
so
long
smoke
keep
your
eyes
open
for
that
hoodoo
all
an
do
be
ashamed
to
turn
back
if
you
do
kill
any
meat
ii
a
week
later
smoke
found
himself
among
the
jumbled
ranges
south
of
indian
river
on
the
divide
from
the
klondike
he
had
abandoned
the
sled
and
packed
his
the
six
big
huskies
each
carried
fifty
pounds
and
on
his
own
back
was
an
equal
burden
through
the
soft
snow
he
led
the
way
packing
it
down
under
his
and
behind
in
single
file
toiled
the
dogs
he
loved
the
life
the
deep
arctic
winter
the
silent
wilderness
the
unending
unpressed
by
the
foot
of
any
man
about
him
towered
icy
peaks
unnamed
and
uncharted
no
hunter
rising
in
the
still
air
of
the
valleys
ever
caught
his
eye
he
alone
moved
through
the
brooding
quiet
of
the
untravelled
wastes
nor
was
he
oppressed
by
the
solitude
he
loved
it
all
the
day
toil
the
bickering
the
making
of
the
camp
in
the
long
twilight
the
leaping
stars
overhead
and
the
flaming
pageant
of
the
aurora
borealis
especially
he
loved
his
camp
at
the
end
of
the
day
and
in
it
he
saw
a
picture
which
he
ever
yearned
to
paint
and
which
he
knew
he
would
never
forget
a
beaten
place
in
the
snow
where
burned
his
fire
his
bed
a
couple
of
robes
spread
on
his
shelter
a
stretched
strip
of
canvas
that
caught
and
threw
back
the
heat
of
the
fire
the
blackened
and
pail
resting
on
a
length
of
log
the
moccasins
propped
on
sticks
to
dry
the
in
the
snow
and
across
the
fire
the
snuggling
to
it
for
the
warmth
wistful
and
eager
furry
and
with
bushy
tails
curled
protectingly
over
their
feet
and
all
about
pressed
backward
but
a
space
the
wall
of
encircling
darkness
at
such
times
san
francisco
the
billow
and
seemed
very
far
away
lost
in
a
remote
past
shadows
of
dreams
that
had
never
happened
he
found
it
hard
to
believe
that
he
had
known
any
other
life
than
this
of
the
wild
and
harder
still
was
it
for
him
to
reconcile
himself
to
the
fact
that
he
had
once
dabbled
and
dawdled
in
the
bohemian
drift
of
city
life
alone
with
no
one
to
talk
to
he
thought
much
and
deeply
and
simply
he
was
appalled
by
the
wastage
of
his
city
years
by
the
cheapness
now
of
the
philosophies
of
the
schools
and
books
of
the
clever
cynicism
of
the
studio
and
editorial
room
of
the
cant
of
the
business
men
in
their
clubs
they
knew
neither
food
nor
sleep
nor
health
nor
could
they
ever
possibly
know
the
sting
of
real
appetite
the
goodly
ache
of
fatigue
nor
the
rush
of
mad
strong
blood
that
bit
like
wine
through
all
one
body
as
work
was
done
and
all
the
time
this
fine
wise
spartan
north
land
had
been
here
and
he
had
never
known
what
puzzled
him
was
that
with
such
intrinsic
fitness
he
had
never
heard
the
slightest
calling
whisper
had
not
himself
gone
forth
to
seek
but
this
too
he
solved
in
time
look
here
i
got
it
clear
the
dog
addressed
lifted
first
one
and
then
the
other
with
quick
appeasing
movements
curled
his
bush
of
a
tail
about
them
again
and
laughed
across
the
fire
herbert
spencer
was
nearly
forty
before
he
caught
the
vision
of
his
greatest
efficiency
and
desire
i
none
so
slow
i
did
have
to
wait
till
i
was
thirty
to
catch
mine
right
here
is
my
efficiency
and
desire
almost
yellow
face
do
i
wish
i
had
been
born
a
and
been
brother
all
my
days
to
you
and
yours
for
days
he
wandered
through
a
chaos
of
canyons
and
divides
which
did
not
yield
themselves
to
any
rational
topographical
plan
it
was
as
if
they
had
been
flung
there
by
some
cosmic
joker
in
vain
he
sought
for
a
creek
or
feeder
that
flowed
truly
south
toward
the
mcquestion
and
the
stewart
then
came
a
mountain
storm
that
blew
a
blizzard
across
the
of
high
and
shallow
divides
above
fireless
for
two
days
he
struggled
blindly
to
find
lower
levels
on
the
second
day
he
came
out
upon
the
rim
of
an
enormous
palisade
so
thickly
drove
the
snow
that
he
could
not
see
the
base
of
the
wall
nor
dared
he
attempt
the
descent
he
rolled
himself
in
his
robes
and
huddled
the
dogs
about
him
in
the
depths
of
a
but
did
not
permit
himself
to
sleep
in
the
morning
the
storm
spent
he
crawled
out
to
investigate
a
quarter
of
a
mile
beneath
him
beyond
all
mistake
lay
a
frozen
lake
about
it
on
every
side
rose
jagged
peaks
it
answered
the
description
blindly
he
had
found
surprise
lake
he
muttered
an
hour
later
as
he
came
out
upon
its
margin
a
clump
of
aged
spruce
was
the
only
woods
on
his
way
to
it
he
stumbled
upon
three
graves
but
marked
by
and
undecipherable
writing
on
the
edge
of
the
woods
was
a
small
ramshackle
cabin
he
pulled
the
latch
and
entered
in
a
corner
on
what
had
once
been
a
bed
of
still
wrapped
in
mangy
furs
that
had
rotted
to
fragments
lay
a
skeleton
the
last
visitor
to
surprise
lake
was
smoke
conclusion
as
he
picked
up
a
lump
of
gold
as
large
as
his
doubled
fist
beside
the
lump
was
a
filled
with
nuggets
of
the
size
of
walnuts
showing
no
signs
of
wash
so
true
had
the
tale
run
that
smoke
accepted
without
question
that
the
source
of
the
gold
was
the
lake
bottom
under
many
feet
of
ice
and
inaccessible
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
and
at
from
the
rim
of
the
palisade
he
took
a
farewell
look
back
and
down
at
his
find
it
all
right
mr
lake
he
said
you
just
keep
right
on
staying
there
i
coming
back
to
drain
you
if
that
hoodoo
does
catch
me
i
do
know
how
i
got
here
but
i
know
by
the
way
i
go
out
iii
in
a
little
valley
beside
a
frozen
stream
and
under
beneficent
spruce
trees
he
built
a
fire
four
days
later
somewhere
in
that
white
anarchy
he
left
behind
him
was
surprise
lake
somewhere
he
knew
not
where
for
a
hundred
hours
of
driftage
and
struggle
through
blinding
driving
snow
had
concealed
his
course
from
him
and
he
knew
not
in
what
direction
lay
behind
it
was
as
if
he
had
just
emerged
from
a
nightmare
he
was
not
sure
that
four
days
or
a
week
had
passed
he
had
slept
with
the
dogs
fought
across
a
forgotten
number
of
shallow
divides
followed
the
windings
of
weird
canyons
that
ended
in
pockets
and
twice
had
managed
to
make
a
fire
and
thaw
out
frozen
and
here
he
was
and
the
storm
had
passed
and
it
had
turned
clear
and
cold
the
lay
of
the
land
had
again
become
rational
the
creek
he
was
on
was
natural
in
appearance
and
trended
as
it
should
toward
the
southwest
but
surprise
lake
was
as
lost
to
him
as
it
had
been
to
all
its
seekers
in
the
past
half
a
day
journey
down
the
creek
brought
him
to
the
valley
of
a
larger
stream
which
he
decided
was
the
mcquestion
here
he
shot
a
moose
and
once
again
each
carried
a
full
pack
of
meat
as
he
turned
down
the
mcquestion
he
came
upon
a
the
late
snows
had
drifted
over
but
underneath
it
was
by
travel
his
conclusion
was
that
two
camps
had
been
established
on
the
mcquestion
and
that
this
was
the
connecting
trail
evidently
two
cabins
had
been
found
and
it
was
the
lower
camp
so
he
headed
down
the
stream
it
was
forty
below
zero
when
he
camped
that
night
and
he
fell
asleep
wondering
who
were
the
men
who
had
rediscovered
the
two
cabins
and
if
he
would
fetch
it
next
day
at
the
first
hint
of
dawn
he
was
under
way
easily
following
the
trail
and
packing
the
recent
snow
with
his
webbed
shoes
so
that
the
dogs
should
not
wallow
and
then
it
came
the
unexpected
leaping
out
upon
him
on
a
bend
of
the
river
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
heard
and
felt
simultaneously
the
crack
of
the
rifle
came
from
the
right
and
the
bullet
tearing
through
and
across
the
shoulders
of
his
drill
parka
and
woollen
coat
pivoted
him
half
around
with
the
shock
of
its
impact
he
staggered
on
his
twisted
to
recover
balance
and
heard
a
second
crack
of
the
rifle
this
time
it
was
a
clean
miss
he
did
not
wait
for
more
but
plunged
across
the
snow
for
the
sheltering
trees
of
the
bank
a
hundred
feet
away
again
and
again
the
rifle
cracked
and
he
was
unpleasantly
aware
of
a
trickle
of
warm
moisture
down
his
back
he
climbed
the
bank
the
dogs
floundering
behind
and
dodged
in
among
the
trees
and
brush
slipping
out
of
his
he
wallowed
forward
at
full
length
and
peered
cautiously
out
nothing
was
to
be
seen
whoever
had
shot
at
him
was
lying
quiet
among
the
trees
of
the
opposite
bank
if
something
does
happen
pretty
soon
he
muttered
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
i
have
to
sneak
away
and
build
a
fire
or
freeze
my
feet
yellow
face
what
you
do
lying
in
the
frost
with
circulation
getting
slack
and
a
man
trying
to
plug
you
he
crawled
back
a
few
yards
packed
down
the
snow
danced
a
jig
that
sent
the
blood
back
into
his
feet
and
managed
to
endure
another
half
hour
then
from
down
the
river
he
heard
the
unmistakable
jingle
of
peering
out
he
saw
a
sled
round
the
bend
only
one
man
was
with
it
straining
at
the
and
urging
the
dogs
along
the
effect
on
smoke
was
one
of
shock
for
it
was
the
first
human
he
had
seen
since
he
parted
from
shorty
three
weeks
before
his
next
thought
was
of
the
potential
murderer
concealed
on
the
opposite
bank
without
exposing
himself
smoke
whistled
warningly
the
man
did
not
hear
and
came
on
rapidly
again
and
more
sharply
smoke
whistled
the
man
whoa
his
dogs
stopped
and
had
turned
and
faced
smoke
when
the
rifle
cracked
the
instant
afterwards
smoke
fired
into
the
wood
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
the
man
on
the
river
had
been
struck
by
the
first
shot
the
shock
of
the
high
velocity
bullet
staggered
him
he
stumbled
awkwardly
to
the
sled
and
pulled
a
rifle
out
from
under
the
lashings
as
he
strove
to
raise
it
to
his
shoulder
he
crumpled
at
the
waist
and
sank
down
slowly
to
a
sitting
posture
on
the
sled
then
abruptly
as
the
gun
went
off
aimlessly
he
pitched
backward
and
across
a
corner
of
the
so
that
smoke
could
see
only
his
legs
and
stomach
from
below
came
more
jingling
bells
the
man
did
not
move
around
the
bend
swung
three
sleds
accompanied
by
half
a
dozen
men
smoke
cried
warningly
but
they
had
seen
the
condition
of
the
first
sled
and
they
dashed
on
to
it
no
shots
came
from
the
other
bank
and
smoke
calling
his
dogs
to
follow
emerged
into
the
open
there
were
exclamations
from
the
men
and
two
of
them
flinging
off
the
mittens
of
their
right
hands
levelled
their
rifles
at
him
come
on
you
murderer
you
one
of
them
a
man
commanded
an
jest
pitch
that
gun
of
yourn
in
the
snow
smoke
hesitated
then
dropped
his
rifle
and
came
up
to
them
go
through
him
louis
an
take
his
weapons
the
man
ordered
louis
a
voyageur
smoke
decided
as
were
four
of
the
others
obeyed
his
search
revealed
only
smoke
hunting
knife
which
was
appropriated
now
what
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
stranger
before
i
shoot
you
dead
the
man
demanded
that
you
making
a
mistake
if
you
think
i
killed
that
man
smoke
answered
a
cry
came
from
one
of
the
voyageurs
he
had
quested
along
the
trail
and
found
smoke
tracks
where
he
had
left
it
to
take
refuge
on
the
bank
the
man
explained
the
nature
of
his
find
what

of
the
black
beard
asked

short
shot

let
me
tell
what
happened
smoke
objected

up
the
man
snarled
at
him
i
reckon
your
gun
tell
the
story
all
the
men
examined
smoke
rifle
ejecting
and
counting
the
cartridges
and
examining
the
barrel
at
muzzle
and
breech
one
shot
blackbeard
concluded
pierre
with
nostrils
that
quivered
and
distended
like
a
deer
sniffed
at
the
breech
him
one
fresh
shot
he
said
the
bullet
entered
his
back
smoke
said
he
was
facing
me
when
he
was
shot
you
see
it
came
from
the
other
bank
blackbeard
considered
this
proposition
for
a
scant
second
and
shook
his
head
nope
it
wo
do
turn
him
around
to
face
the
other
bank
how
you
whopped
him
in
the
back
some
of
you
boys
run
up
an
down
the
trail
and
see
if
you
can
see
any
tracks
making
for
the
other
bank
their
report
was
that
on
that
side
the
snow
was
unbroken
not
even
a
rabbit
had
crossed
it
blackbeard
bending
over
the
dead
man
straightened
up
with
a
woolly
furry
wad
in
his
hand
shredding
this
he
found
imbedded
in
the
centre
the
bullet
which
had
perforated
the
body
its
nose
was
spread
to
the
size
of
a
its
was
undamaged
he
compared
it
with
a
cartridge
from
smoke
belt
that
plain
enough
evidence
stranger
to
satisfy
a
blind
man
an
yourn
is
and
it
yourn
is
it
manufactured
by
the
and
arms
company
yourn

said
look
at
the
hole
in
my
parka
while
blackbeard
examined
it
one
of
the
voyageurs
threw
open
the
breech
of
the
dead
man
gun
it
was
patent
to
all
that
it
had
been
fired
once
the
empty
cartridge
was
still
in
the
chamber
a
damn
shame
poor
joe
did
get
you
blackbeard
said
bitterly
but
he
did
pretty
well
with
a
hole
like
that
in
him
come
on
you
search
the
other
bank
first
smoke
urged
you
shut
up
an
come
on
an
let
the
facts
do
the
talkin
they
left
the
trail
at
the
same
spot
he
had
and
followed
it
on
up
the
bank
and
in
among
the
trees
him
dance
that
place
keep
him
feet
warm
louis

that
place
him
crawl
on
belly
that
place

shoot
and
by
god
there
the
empty
cartridge
he
had
done
it
with
was
blackbeard
discovery
boys
there
only
one
thing
to
do
you
might
ask
me
how
i
came
to
fire
that
shot
smoke
interrupted
an
i
might
knock
your
teeth
into
your
gullet
if
you
butt
in
again
you
can
answer
them
questions
later
on
now
boys
we
decent
an
we
got
to
handle
this
right
an
regular
how
far
do
you
reckon
we
come
pierre
twenty
mile
i
for
sure
all
right
we
cache
the
outfit
an
run
him
an
poor
joe
back
to
two
cabins
i
reckon
we
seen
an
can
testify
to
what
stretch
his
neck
iv
it
was
three
hours
after
dark
when
the
dead
man
smoke
and
his
captors
arrived
at
two
cabins
by
the
starlight
smoke
could
make
out
a
dozen
or
more
recently
built
cabins
snuggling
about
a
larger
and
older
cabin
on
a
flat
by
the
river
bank
thrust
inside
this
older
cabin
he
found
it
tenanted
by
a
young
giant
of
a
man
his
wife
and
an
old
blind
man
the
woman
whom
her
husband
called
was
herself
a
strapping
creature
of
the
frontier
type
the
old
man
as
smoke
learned
afterwards
had
been
a
trapper
on
the
stewart
for
years
and
had
gone
finally
blind
the
winter
before
the
camp
of
two
cabins
he
was
also
to
learn
had
been
made
the
previous
fall
by
a
dozen
men
who
arrived
in
half
as
many
loaded
with
provisions
here
they
had
found
the
blind
trapper
on
the
site
of
two
cabins
and
about
his
cabin
they
had
built
their
own
later
arrivals
mushing
up
the
ice
with
had
tripled
the
population
there
was
plenty
of
meat
in
camp
and
good
dirt
had
been
discovered
and
was
being
worked
in
five
minutes
all
the
men
of
two
cabins
were
jammed
into
the
room
smoke
shoved
off
into
a
corner
ignored
and
scowled
at
his
hands
and
feet
tied
with
thongs
of
moosehide
looked
on
men
he
counted
a
wild
and
husky
crew
all
frontiersmen
of
the
states
or
voyageurs
from
upper
canada
his
captors
told
the
tale
over
and
over
each
the
centre
of
an
excited
and
wrathful
group
there
were
mutterings
of
lynch
him
now
why
wait
and
once
a
big
irishman
was
restrained
only
by
force
from
rushing
upon
the
helpless
prisoner
and
giving
him
a
beating
it
was
while
counting
the
men
that
smoke
caught
sight
of
a
familiar
face
it
was
breck
the
man
whose
boat
smoke
had
run
through
the
rapids
he
wondered
why
the
other
did
not
come
and
speak
to
him
but
himself
gave
no
sign
of
recognition
later
when
with
shielded
face
breck
passed
him
a
significant
wink
smoke
understood
blackbeard
whom
smoke
heard
called
eli
harding
ended
the
discussion
as
to
whether
or
not
the
prisoner
should
be
immediately
lynched
hold
on
harding
roared
keep
your
shirts
on
that
man
belongs
to
me
i
caught
him
an
i
brought
him
here
d
think
i
brought
him
all
the
way
here
to
be
lynched
not
on
your
life
i
could
that
myself
when
i
found
him
i
brought
him
here
for
a
fair
an
impartial
trial
an
by
god
a
fair
an
impartial
trial
he
goin
to
get
tied
up
safe
an
sound
chuck
him
in
a
bunk
till
morning
an
hold
the
trial
right
here
smoke
woke
up
a
draught
that
possessed
all
the
rigidity
of
an
icicle
was
boring
into
the
front
of
his
shoulder
as
he
lay
on
his
side
facing
the
wall
when
he
had
been
tied
into
the
bunk
there
had
been
no
such
draught
and
now
the
outside
air
driving
into
the
heated
atmosphere
of
the
cabin
with
the
pressure
of
fifty
below
zero
was
sufficient
advertizement
that
some
one
from
without
had
pulled
away
the
between
the
logs
he
squirmed
as
far
as
his
bonds
would
permit
then
craned
his
neck
forward
until
his
lips
just
managed
to
reach
the
crack
who
is
it
he
whispered
breck
came
the
answer
be
careful
you
do
make
a
noise
going
to
pass
a
knife
in
to
you
no
good
smoke
said
i
could
use
it
my
hands
are
tied
behind
me
and
made
fast
to
the
leg
of
the
bunk
besides
you
could
get
a
knife
through
that
crack
but
something
must
be
done
those
fellows
are
of
a
temper
to
hang
me
and
of
course
you
know
i
did
kill
that
man
it
was
necessary
to
mention
it
smoke
and
if
you
did
you
had
your
reasons
which
is
the
point
at
all
i
want
to
get
you
out
of
this
it
a
tough
bunch
of
men
here
you
seen
them
they
shut
off
from
the
world
and
they
make
and
enforce
their
own
law
by
meeting
you
know
they
handled
two
men
already
both
one
they
hiked
from
camp
without
an
ounce
of
grub
and
no
matches
he
made
about
forty
miles
and
lasted
a
couple
of
days
before
he
froze
stiff
two
weeks
ago
they
hiked
the
second
man
they
gave
him
his
choice
no
grub
or
ten
lashes
for
each
day
ration
he
stood
for
forty
lashes
before
he
fainted
and
now
they
got
you
and
every
last
one
is
convinced
you
killed
kinade
the
man
who
killed
kinade
shot
at
me
too
his
bullet
broke
the
skin
on
my
shoulder
get
them
to
delay
the
trial
till
some
one
goes
up
and
searches
the
bank
where
the
murderer
hid
no
use
they
take
the
evidence
of
harding
and
the
five
frenchmen
with
him
besides
they
have
had
a
hanging
yet
and
they
keen
for
it
you
see
things
have
been
pretty
monotonous
they
have
located
anything
big
and
they
got
tired
of
hunting
for
surprise
lake
they
did
some
stampeding
the
first
part
of
the
winter
but
they
got
over
that
now
scurvy
is
beginning
to
show
up
amongst
them
too
and
they
just
ripe
for
excitement
and
it
looks
like
i
furnish
it
was
smoke
comment

breck
how
did
you
ever
fall
in
with
such
a
bunch
after
i
got
the
claims
at
squaw
creek
opened
up
and
some
men
to
working
i
came

higher
up
the
stewart
just
got
back
yesterday

but
i
think
i
got
a
hydraulic
proposition
work
big
when
the
country
opened
up
it
that
or
a
hold
on
smoke
interrupted
wait
a
minute
let
me
think
he
was
very
much
aware
of
the
snores
of
the
sleepers
as
he
pursued
the
idea
that
had
flashed
into
his
mind
say
breck
have
they
opened
up
the
my
dogs
carried
a
couple
i
was
watching
they
put
them
in
harding
cache
did
they
find
anything
meat
good
you
got
to
get
into
the
brown
canvas
pack
that
patched
with
moosehide
you
find
a
few
pounds
of
lumpy
gold
you
never
seen
gold
like
it
in
the
country
nor
has
anybody
else
here
what
you
got
to
do
listen
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
fully
instructed
and
complaining
that
his
toes
were
freezing
breck
went
away
smoke
his
own
nose
and
one
cheek
frosted
by
proximity
to
the
chink
rubbed
them
against
the
blankets
for
half
an
hour
before
the
blaze
and
bite
of
the
returning
blood
assured
him
of
the
safety
of
his
flesh
vi
my
mind
made
up
right
now
there
ai
no
doubt
but
what
he
killed
kinade
we
heard
the
whole
thing
last
night
what
the
good
of
over
it
again
i
vote
guilty
in
such
fashion
smoke
trial
began
the
speaker
a
man
from
colorado
manifested
irritation
and
disgust
when
harding
set
his
suggestion
aside
demanded
the
proceedings
should
be
regular
and
nominated
one
shunk
wilson
for
judge
and
chairman
of
the
meeting
the
population
of
two
cabins
constituted
the
jury
though
after
some
discussion
the
woman
lucy
was
denied
the
right
to
vote
on
smoke
guilt
or
innocence
while
this
was
going
on
smoke
jammed
into
a
corner
on
a
bunk

a
whispered
conversation
between
breck
and
a
miner

the
two
squeezed
their
way
to
the
door
and
slipped
out
after
a
few
minutes
breck
returned
alone
harding
was
testifying
when
smoke
saw
the
door
shoved
open
slightly
and
in
the
crack
appear
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
sold
the
flour
he
was
grimacing
and
beckoning
emphatically
to
one
inside

stove
and
started
to
work
toward

he
was
in
the
middle
of
the
of
harding
when
from
without
came
the
whining
of
dogs
in
harness
and
the
grind
and
churn
of
somebody
near
the
door
peeped
out
it
sam
an
his
pardner
an
a
down
the
trail
for
stewart
river
the
man
reported
nobody
spoke
for
a
long
but
men
glanced
significantly
at
one
another
and
a
general
restlessness
pervaded
the
packed
room
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
smoke
caught
a
glimpse
of
breck
lucy
and
her
husband
whispering
together

where
you
goin
shunk
wilson
shouted
i
reckon

she
answered
defiantly
i
ai
got
no
vote
an
besides
my
cabin
so
jammed
up
i
ca
breathe
in
a
few
minutes
her
husband
followed
the
closing
of
the
door
was
the
first
warning
the
judge
received
of
it
who
was
that
he
interrupted
pierre
narrative
to
ask
bill
peabody
somebody
spoke
up
said
he
wanted
to
ask
his
wife
something
and
was
coming
right
back
instead
of
bill
it
was
lucy
who
took
off
her
furs
and
resumed
her
place
by
the
stove
i
reckon
we
do
need
to
hear
the
rest
of
the
witnesses
was
shunk
wilson
decision
when
pierre
had
finished
we
know
they
only
can
testify
to
the
same
facts
we
already
heard
say
sorensen
you
go
an
bring
bill
peabody
back
we
be
votin
a
verdict
pretty
short
now
stranger
you
can
get
up
an
say
your
say
concernin
what
happened
in
the
meantime
we
just
be
savin
delay
by
passin
around
the
two
rifles
the
ammunition
an
the
bullets
that
done
the
killin
midway
in
his
story
of
how
he
had
arrived
in
that
part
of
the
country
and
at
the
point
in
his
narrative
where
he
described
his
own
ambush
and
how
he
had
fled
to
the
bank
smoke
was
interrupted
by
the
indignant
shunk
wilson
young
man
what
sense
is
there
in
you
testifyin
that
way
just
takin
up
valuable
time
of
course
you
got
the
right
to
lie
to
save
your
neck
but
we
ai
goin
to
stand
for
such
foolishness
the
rifle
the
ammunition
the
bullet
that
killed
joe
kinade
is
against
you
what
that
open
the
door
somebody
the
frost
rushed
in
taking
form
and
substance
in
the
heat
of
the
room
while
through
the
open
door
came
the
whining
of
dogs
that
decreased
rapidly
with
distance
it
sorensen
an
peabody
some
one
cried
the
whip
into
the
dawgs
an
headin
down
river
now
what
the
hell
shunk
wilson
paused
with
dropped
jaw
and
glared
at
lucy
i
reckon
you
can
explain
mrs
peabody
she
tossed
her
head
and
compressed
her
lips
and
shunk
wrathful
and
suspicious
gaze
passed
on
and
rested
on
breck
an
i
reckon
that
you
ben
chinning
with
could
explain
if
he
had
a
mind
to
breck
now
very
uncomfortable
found
all
eyes
centred
on
him
sam
was
chewing
the
rag
with
him
too
before
he
hit
out
some
one
said
look
here
mr
breck
shunk
wilson
continued
you
ben
interruptin
proceedings
and
you
got
to
explain
the
meanin
of
it
what
was
you
chinnin
about

cleared
his
throat
timidly
and
replied
i
was
just
trying
to
buy
some
grub
what
with
dust
of
course
where
you
get
it
breck
did

across
his
camp
a
week

when

was
huntin
an
i
want

let
see
it
just
the
same
breck
made
as
if
to
refuse
but
all
about
him
were
menacing
faces
reluctantly
he
fumbled
in
his
coat
pocket
in
the
act
of
drawing
forth
a
pepper
can
it
rattled
against
what
was
evidently
a
hard
object
fetch
it
all
out
shunk
wilson
thundered
and
out
came
the
big
nugget
yellow
as
no
gold
any
onlooker
had
ever
seen
shunk
wilson
gasped
half
a
dozen
catching
one
glimpse
made
a
break
for
the
door
they
reached
it
at
the
same
moment
and
with
cursing
and
scuffling
jammed
and
pivoted
through
the
judge
emptied
the
contents
of
the
pepper
can
on
the
table
and
the
sight
of
the
rough
sent
half
a
dozen
more
toward
the
door
where
are
you
goin
eli
harding
asked
as
shunk
started
to
follow
for

one
last
look
at
the
on
the
table
and
decided

besides
i

another
one
of
them
blamed
stampedes
the
old
blind
trapper
asked
in
a
queer
and
petulant
falsetto
as
the
cries
of
men
and
dogs
and
the
grind
of
the
sleds
swept
the
silence
of
the
room

a
man
hidden
on
that
bank
he
came
pretty
close
to
emptying
his
magazine
at
me
half
an
hour
afterward
with
a
big
plate
of
before
him
and
a
big
mug
of
coffee
at
his
lips
smoke
up
from
his
seat
he
had
heard
the
sounds
first
lucy
threw
open
the
door
hello

greeted
the
two
men
who
were
bending
over
the
burden
on
their
sled
we
just
come
down
from
upper
camp
one
said
as
the
pair
staggered
into
the
room
with
a
object
which
they
handled
with
exceeding
gentleness
an
this
is
what
we
found
by
the
way
he
all
in
i
guess
put
him
in
the
near
bunk
there
lucy
said
she
bent
over
and
pulled
back
the
furs
disclosing
a
face
composed
principally
of
large
staring
black
eyes
and
of
skin
dark
and
scabbed
by
repeated
tightly
stretched
across
the
bones
if
it
ai
alonzo
she
cried
you
pore
starved
devil
that
the
man
on
the
other
bank
smoke
said
in
an
undertone
to
breck
we
found
it
raidin
a
cache
that
harding
must
one
of
the
men
was
explaining
he

at
him
he
all
starved
an
most
of
him
frozen
he
kick
at
any
moment
half
an
hour
later
when
the
furs
had
been
drawn
over
the
face
of
the
still
form
in
the
bunk
smoke
turned
to
lucy

i
huh
get
on
to
the
glad
rags
shorty
surveyed
his
partner
with
simulated
disapproval
and
smoke
vainly
attempting
to
rub
the
wrinkles
out
of
the
pair
of
trousers
he
had
just
put
on
was
irritated
they
sure
fit
you
close
for
a
buy
shorty
went
on
what
was
the
tax
one
hundred
and
fifty
for
the
suit
smoke
answered
the
man

nearly
my
own
size
i
thought
it
was
remarkable
reasonable
what
are
you

about
who

i
was
just
thinkin
it
was
goin
some

dawson
in
an
with
no
grub
one
suit
of
underclothes
a
pair
of
mangy
moccasins
an
overalls
that
looked
like
they
ben
through
the
wreck
of
the
hesperus
pretty
gay
front
pardner
pretty
gay
front
say
what
do
you

now
smoke
demanded
testily
what
her
name
there
is
any
her
my
friend
i
to
have
dinner
at
colonel
bowie
if
you
want
to
know
the
trouble
with
you
shorty
is
envious
because
i
going
into
high
society
and
you
not
invited
ai
you
some
late
shorty
queried
with
concern
what
do
you
mean
for
dinner
they
be
eatin
supper
when
you
get
there
smoke
was
about
to
explain
with
elaborate
sarcasm
when
he
caught
the
twinkle
in
the
others
eyes
he
went
on
dressing
with
fingers
that
had
lost
their
deftness
tying
a
windsor
tie
in
a
at
the
throat
of
the
soft
cotton
shirt
wish
i
had
sent
all
my
starched
shirts
to
the
laundry
shorty
murmured
sympathetically
i
might
you
out
by
this
time
smoke
was
straining
at
a
pair
of
shoes
the
thick
woollen
socks
were
too
thick
to
go
into
them
he
looked
appealingly
at
shorty
who
shook
his
head
nope
if
i
had
thin
ones
i
would
lend
to
you
back
to
the
moccasins
pardner
you
sure
freeze
your
toes
in
gear
like
that
i
paid
fifteen
dollars
for
them
smoke
lamented
i
reckon
they
wo
be
a
man
not
in
moccasins
but
there
are
to
be
women
shorty
i
going
to
sit
down
and
eat
with
real
live
women
mrs
bowie
and
several
others
so
the
colonel
told
me
well
moccasins
wo
spoil
their
appetite
none
was
comment
wonder
what
the
colonel
wants
with
you
i
do
know
unless
he
heard
about
my
finding
surprise
lake
it
will
take
a
fortune
to
drain
it
and
the
guggenheims
are
out
for
investment
reckon
that
it
that
right
stick
to
the
moccasins
gee
that
coat
is
sure
wrinkled
an
it
fits
you
a
mite
too
swift
just
peck
around
at
your
vittles
if
you
eat
hearty
you
bust
through
and
if
them
gets
to
droppin
handkerchiefs
just
let
lay
do
do
any
pickin
up
whatever
you
do
do
ii
as
became
a
expert
and
the
representative
of
the
great
house
of
guggenheim
colonel
bowie
lived
in
one
of
the
most
magnificent
cabins
in
dawson
of
squared
logs
it
was
two
stories
high
and
of
such
extravagant
proportions
that
it
boasted
a
big
living
room
that
was
used
for
a
living
room
and
for
nothing
else
here
were
big
on
the
rough
board
floor
and
on
the
walls
horns
of
moose
and
caribou
here
roared
an
open
fireplace
and
a
big
stove
and
here
smoke
met
the
social
elect
of
dawson
not
the
mere
millionaires
but
the
of
a
mining
city
whose
population
had
been
recruited
from
all
the
world
men
like
warburton
jones
the
explorer
and
writer
captain
consadine
of
the
mounted
police
haskell
gold
commissioner
of
the
territory
and
baron
von
schroeder
an
emperor
favourite
with
an
international
duelling
reputation
and
here
dazzling
in
evening
gown
he
met
joy
gastell
whom
hitherto
he
had
encountered
only
on
trail
befurred
and
moccasined
at
dinner
he
found
himself
beside
her
i
feel
like
a
fish
out
of
water
he
confessed
all
you
folks
are
so
real
grand
you
know
besides
i
never
dreamed
such
oriental
luxury
existed
in
the
klondike
look
at
von
schroeder
there
he
actually
got
a
dinner
jacket
and
consadine
got
a
starched
shirt
i
noticed
he
wore
moccasins
just
the
same
how
do
you
like
my
outfit
he
moved
his
shoulders
about
as
if
preening
himself
for
joy
approval
it
looks
as
if
you
grown
stout
since
you
came
over
the
pass
she
laughed
wrong
guess
again
it
somebody
else
you
win
i
bought
it
for
a
price
from
one
of
the
clerks
at
the
c
company
it
a
shame
clerks
are
so
she
sympathized
and
you
have
told
me
what
you
think
of
my
outfit
i
ca
he
said
i
out
of
breath
i
been
living
on
trail
too
long
this
sort
of
thing
comes
to
me
with
a
shock
you
know
i
quite
forgotten
that
women
have
arms
and
shoulders
morning
like
my
friend
shorty
i
wake
up
and
know
it
all
a
dream
now
the
last
time
i
saw
you
on
squaw
creek
i
was
just
a
squaw
she
broke
in
i
had
intended
to
say
that
i
was
remembering
that
it
was
on
squaw
creek
that
i
discovered
you
had
feet
and
i
can
never
forget
that
you
saved
them
for
me
she
said
been
wanting
to
see
you
ever
since
to
thank
you
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
deprecatingly
and
that
why
you
are
here
you
asked
the
colonel
to
invite
me
no
mrs
bowie
and
i
asked
her
to
let
me
have
you
at
table
and
here
my
chance
everybody
talking
listen
and
do
interrupt
you
know
mono
creek
yes
it
has
turned
out
rich
dreadfully
rich
they
estimate
the
claims
as
worth
a
million
and
more
apiece
it
was
only
located
the
other
day
i
remember
the
stampede
well
the
whole
creek
was
staked
to
the
and
all
the
feeders
too
and
yet
right
now
on
the
main
creek
number
three
below
discovery
is
unrecorded
the
creek
was
so
far
away
from
dawson
that
the
commissioner
allowed
sixty
days
for
recording
after
location
every
claim
was
recorded
except
number
three
below
it
was
staked
by
cyrus
johnson
and
that
was
all
cyrus
johnson
has
disappeared
whether
he
died
whether
he
went
down
river
or
up
nobody
knows
anyway
in
six
days
the
time
for
recording
will
be
up
then
the
man
who
stakes
it
and
reaches
dawson
first
and
records
it
gets
it
a
million
dollars
smoke
murmured
gilchrist
who
has
the
next
claim
below
has
got
six
hundred
dollars
in
a
single
pan
off
bedrock
he
burned
one
hole
down
and
the
claim
on
the
other
side
is
even
richer
i
know
but
why
does
everybody
know
smoke
queried
skeptically
they
beginning
to
know
they
kept
it
secret
for
a
long
time
and
it
is
only
now
that
it
coming
out
good
will
be
at
a
premium
in
another
hours

to
get

but
before
she
could
continue
smoke
was
speaking

dogs
but
er
are

is
gambling
after
your
exploits

retorted

sporting
proposition

what
you
mean

race
for
a
million
and
with
some
of
the
stiffest
and
travellers
in
the
country
entered
against
you
they
have
entered
yet
but
by
this
time
they
will
and
dogs
will
be
worth
what
the
richest
man
can
afford
to
pay
big
olaf
is
in
town
he
came
up
from
circle
city
last
month
he
is
one
of
the
most
terrible
in
the
country
and
if
he
enters
he
will
be
your
most
dangerous
man
arizona
bill
is
another
he
been
a
professional
freighter
and
for
years
it
he
goes
in
interest
will
be
centred
on
him
and
big
olaf
and
you
intend
me
to
come
along
as
a
sort
of
dark
horse
exactly
and
it
will
have
its
advantages
you
will
not
be
supposed
to
stand
a
show
after
all
you
know
you
are
still
classed
as
a
chechaquo
you
have
seen
the
four
seasons
go
around
nobody
will
take
notice
of
you
until
you
come
into
the
home
stretch
in
the
lead
it
on
the
home
stretch
the
dark
horse
is
to
show
up
its
classy
form
eh
she
nodded
and
continued
earnestly
remember
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
the
trick
i
played
on
the
squaw
creek
stampede
until
you
win
this
mono
claim
and
if
any
man
can
win
this
race
against
the
it
you
it
was
the
way
she
said
it
he
felt
warm
all
over
and
in
his
heart
and
head
he
gave
her
a
quick
searching
look
involuntary
and
serious
and
for
the
moment
that
her
eyes
met
his
steadily
ere
they
fell
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
read
something
of
vaster
import
than
the
claim
cyrus
johnson
had
failed
to
record
i
do
it
he
said
i
win
it
the
glad
light
in
her
eyes
seemed
to
promise
a
greater
need
than
all
the
gold
in
the
mono
claim
he
was
aware
of
a
movement
of
her
hand
in
her
lap
next
to
his
under
the
screen
of
the
tablecloth
he
thrust
his
own
hand
across
and
met
a
firm
grip
of
woman
fingers
that
sent
another
wave
of
warmth
through
him
what
will
shorty
say
was
the
thought
that
flashed
whimsically
through
his
mind
as
he
withdrew
his
hand
he
glanced
almost
jealously
at
the
faces
of
von
schroeder
and
jones
and
wondered
if
they
had
not
divined
the
remarkableness
and
deliciousness
of
this
woman
who
sat
beside
him
he
was
aroused
by
her
voice
and
realized
that
she
had
been
speaking
some
moments
so
you
see
arizona
bill
is
a
white
indian
she
was
saying
and
big
olaf
is
a
bear
wrestler
a
king
of
the
snows
a
mighty
savage
he
can
and
an
indian
and
he
never
known
any
other
life
but
that
of
the
wild
and
the
frost
who
that
captain
consadine
broke
in
from
across
the
table
big
olaf
she
answered
i
was
just
telling
mr
bellew
what
a
traveller
he
is
you
right
the
captain
voice
boomed
big
olaf
is
the
greatest
traveller
in
the
yukon
i
back
him
against
old
nick
himself
for
and
he
brought
in
the
government
dispatches
in
and
he
did
it
after
two
couriers
were
frozen
on
chilcoot
and
the
third
drowned
in
the
open
water
of
thirty
mile
iii
smoke
had
travelled
in
a
leisurely
fashion
up
to
mono
creek
fearing
to
tire
his
dogs
before
the
big
race
also
he
had
familiarized
himself
with
every
mile
of
the
trail
and
located
his
relay
camps
so
many
men
had
entered
the
race
that
the
hundred
and
ten
miles
of
its
course
was
almost
a
continuous
village
relay
camps
were
everywhere
along
the
trail
von
schroeder
who
had
gone
in
purely
for
the
sport
had
no
less
than
eleven
dog
teams
a
fresh
one
for
every
ten
miles
arizona
bill
had
been
forced
to
content
himself
with
eight
teams
big
olaf
had
seven
which
was
the
complement
of
smoke
in
addition
over
of
other
men
were
in
the
running
not
every
day
even
in
the
golden
north
was
a
million
dollars
the
prize
for
a
dog
race
the
country
had
been
swept
of
dogs
no
animal
of
speed
and
endurance
escaped
the
comb
that
had
raked
the
creeks
and
camps
and
the
prices
of
dogs
had
doubled
and
quadrupled
in
the
course
of
the
frantic
speculation
number
three
below
discovery
was
ten
miles
up
mono
creek
from
its
mouth
the
remaining
hundred
miles
was
to
be
run
on
the
frozen
breast
of
the
yukon
on
number
three
itself
were
fifty
tents
and
over
three
hundred
dogs
the
old
stakes
blazed
and
scrawled
sixty
days
before
by
cyrus
johnson
still
stood
and
every
man
had
gone
over
the
boundaries
of
the
claim
again
and
again
for
the
race
with
dogs
was
to
be
preceded
by
a
foot
and
obstacle
race
each
man
had
to
the
claim
for
himself
and
this
meant
that
he
must
place
two
and
four
and
cross
the
creek
twice
before
he
could
start
for
dawson
with
his
dogs
furthermore
there
were
to
be
no
not
until
the
stroke
of
midnight
of
friday
night
was
the
claim
open
for
and
not
until
the
stroke
of
midnight
could
a
man
plant
a
stake
this
was
the
ruling
of
the
gold
commissioner
at
dawson
and
captain
consadine
had
sent
up
a
squad
of
mounted
police
to
enforce
it
discussion
had
arisen
about
the
difference
between
and
but
consadine
had
sent
forth
his
fiat
that
police
time
went
and
further
that
it
was
the
watch
of
lieutenant
pollock
that
went
the
mono
trail
ran
along
the
level
and
less
than
two
feet
in
width
was
like
a
groove
walled
on
either
side
by
the
of
months
the
problem
of
how
sleds
and
three
hundred
dogs
were
to
start
in
so
narrow
a
course
was
in
everybody
mind
huh
said
shorty
it
goin
to
be
the
that
ever
was
i
ca
see
no
way
out

a
hunch

schroeder
scheme

he
got
his
first
team
a
quarter
of
a
mile
down
the
creek
an
he
know
it
by
a
green
lantern
but
we
got
him
skinned
me
for
the
red
flare
every
time
iv
the
day
had
been
clear
and
cold
but
a
blanket
of
cloud
formed
across
the
face
of
the
sky
and
the
night
came
on
warm
and
dark
with
the
hint
of
snow
impending
the
thermometer
registered
fifteen
below
zero
and
in
the
fifteen
below
is
esteemed
very
warm
at
a
few
minutes
before
midnight
leaving
shorty
with
the
dogs
five
hundred
yards
down
the
creek
smoke
joined
the
racers
on
number
three
there
were
of
them
waiting
the
start
for
the
dollars
cyrus
johnson
had
left
lying
in
the
frozen
gravel
each
man
carried
six
stakes
and
a
heavy
wooden
mallet
and
was
clad
in
a
parka
of
heavy
cotton
drill
lieutenant
pollock
in
a
big
bearskin
coat
looked
at
his
watch
by
the
light
of
a
fire
it
lacked
a
minute
of
midnight
make
ready
he
said
as
he
raised
a
revolver
in
his
right
hand
and
watched
the
second
hand
tick
around
hoods
were
thrown
back
from
the
parkas
pairs
of
hands
unmittened
and
pairs
of
moccasins
pressed
tensely
into
the
packed
snow
also
stakes
were
thrust
into
the
snow
and
the
same
number
of
mallets
lifted
in
the
air
the
shots
rang
out
and
the
mallets
fell
cyrus
johnson
right
to
the
million
had
expired
to
prevent
confusion
lieutenant
pollock
had
insisted
that
the
lower
be
driven
first
next
the
and
so
on
around
the
four
sides
including
the
upper
on
the
way
smoke
drove
in
his
stake
and
was
away
with
the
leading
dozen
fires
had
been
lighted
at
the
corners
and
by
each
fire
stood
a
policeman
list
in
hand
checking
off
the
names
of
the
runners
a
man
was
supposed
to
call
out
his
name
and
show
his
face
there
was
to
be
no
staking
by
proxy
while
the
real
racer
was
off
and
away
down
the
creek
at
the
first
corner
beside
smoke
stake
von
schroeder
placed
his
the
mallets
struck
at
the
same
instant
as
they
hammered
more
arrived
from
behind
and
with
such
impetuosity
as
to
get
in
one
another
way
and
cause
jostling
and
shoving
squirming
through
the
press
and
calling
his
name
to
the
policeman
smoke
saw
the
baron
struck
in
collision
by
one
of
the
rushers
hurled
clean
off
his
feet
into
the
snow
but
smoke
did
not
wait
others
were
still
ahead
of
him
by
the
light
of
the
vanishing
fire
he
was
certain
that
he
saw
the
back
hugely
looming
of
big
olaf
and
at
the
corner
big
olaf
and
he
drove
their
stakes
side
by
side
it
was
no
light
work
this
preliminary
obstacle
race
the
boundaries
of
the
claim
totalled
nearly
a
mile
and
most
of
it
was
over
the
uneven
surface
of
a
niggerhead
flat
all
about
smoke
men
tripped
and
fell
and
several
times
he
pitched
forward
himself
jarringly
on
hands
and
knees
once
big
olaf
fell
so
immediately
in
front
of
him
as
to
bring
him
down
on
top
the
upper
was
driven
by
the
edge
of
the
bank
and
down
the
bank
the
racers
plunged
across
the
frozen
and
up
the
other
side
here
as
smoke
clambered
a
hand
gripped
his
ankle
and
jerked
him
back
in
the
flickering
light
of
a
distant
fire
it
was
impossible
to
see
who
had
played
the
trick
but
arizona
bill
who
had
been
treated
similarly
rose
to
his
feet
and
drove
his
fist
with
a
crunch
into
the
offender
face
smoke
saw
and
heard
as
he
was
scrambling
to
his
feet
but
before
he
could
make
another
lunge
for
the
bank
a
fist
dropped
him
into
the
snow
he
staggered
up
located
the
man
a
hook
for
his
jaw
then
remembered
shorty
warning
and
refrained
the
next
moment
struck
below
the
knees
by
a
hurtling
body
he
went
down
again
it
was
a
foretaste
of
what
would
happen
when
the
men
reached
their
sleds
men
were
pouring
over
the
other
bank
and
piling
into
the
jam
they
swarmed
up
the
bank
in
bunches
and
in
bunches
were
dragged
back
by
their
impatient
fellows
more
blows
were
struck
curses
rose
from
the
panting
chests
of
those
who
still
had
wind
to
spare
and
smoke
curiously
visioning
the
face
of
joy
gastell
hoped
that
the
mallets
would
not
be
brought
into
play
overthrown
trod
upon
groping
in
the
snow
for
his
lost
stakes
he
at
last
crawled
out
of
the
crush
and
attacked
the
bank
farther
along
others
were
doing
this
and
it
was
his
luck
to
have
many
men
in
advance
of
him
in
the
race
for
the
northwestern
corner
down
to
the
fourth
corner
he
tripped
midway
and
in
the
long
sprawling
fall
lost
his
remaining
stake
for
five
minutes
he
groped
in
the
darkness
before
he
found
it
and
all
the
time
the
panting
runners
were
passing
him
from
the
last
corner
to
the
creek
he
began
overtaking
men
for
whom
the
had
been
too
much
in
the
creek
itself
bedlam
had
broken
loose
a
dozen
sleds
were
piled
up
and
overturned
and
nearly
a
hundred
dogs
were
locked
in
combat
among
them
men
struggled
tearing
the
tangled
animals
apart
or
beating
them
apart
with
clubs
in
the
fleeting
glimpse
he
caught
of
it
smoke
wondered
if
he
had
ever
seen
a
dore
grotesquery
to
compare
leaping
down
the
bank
beyond
the
glutted
passage
he
gained
the
of
the
and
made
better
time
here
in
packed
harbours
beside
the
narrow
trail
sleds
and
men
waited
for
runners
that
were
still
behind
from
the
rear
came
the
whine
and
rush
of
dogs
and
smoke
had
barely
time
to
leap
aside
into
the
deep
snow
a
sled
tore
past
and
he
made
out
the
man
kneeling
and
shouting
madly
scarcely
was
it
by
when
it
stopped
with
a
crash
of
battle
the
excited
dogs
of
a
harboured
sled
resenting
the
passing
animals
had
got
out
of
hand
and
sprung
upon
them
smoke
plunged
around
and
by
he
could
see
the
green
lantern
of
von
schroeder
and
just
below
it
the
red
flare
that
marked
his
own
team
two
men
were
guarding
schroeder
dogs
with
short
clubs
interposed
between
them
and
the
trail
come
on
you
smoke
come
on
you
smoke
he
could
hear
shorty
calling
anxiously
coming
he
gasped
by
the
red
flare
he
could
see
the
snow
torn
up
and
trampled
and
from
the
way
his
partner
breathed
he
knew
a
battle
had
been
fought
he
staggered
to
the
sled
and
in
a
moment
he
was
falling
on
it
whip
snapped
as
he
yelled
mush
you
devils
mush
the
dogs
sprang
into
the
and
the
sled
jerked
abruptly
ahead
they
were
big
animals
hanson
prize
team
of
hudson
bays
and
smoke
had
selected
them
for
the
first
stage
which
included
the
ten
miles
of
mono
the
of
the
across
the
flat
at
the
mouth
and
the
first
ten
miles
of
the
yukon
stretch
how
many
are
ahead
he
asked
you
shut
up
an
save
your
wind
shorty
answered
hi
you
brutes
hit
her
up
hit
her
up
he
was
running
behind
the
sled
towing
on
a
short
rope
smoke
could
not
see
him
nor
could
he
see
the
sled
on
which
he
lay
at
full
length
the
fires
had
been
left
in
the
rear
and
they
were
tearing
through
a
wall
of
blackness
as
fast
as
the
dogs
could
spring
into
it
this
blackness
was
almost
sticky
so
nearly
did
it
take
on
the
seeming
of
substance
smoke
felt
the
sled
heel
up
on
one
runner
as
it
rounded
an
invisible
curve
and
from
ahead
came
the
snarls
of
beasts
and
the
oaths
of
men
this
was
known
afterward
as
the
jam
it
was
the
teams
of
these
two
men
which
first
collided
and
into
it
at
full
career
piled
smoke
seven
big
fighters
scarcely
more
than
wolves
the
excitement
of
that
night
on
mono
creek
had
sent
every
dog
the
klondike
dogs
driven
without
reins
can
not
be
stopped
except
by
voice
so
that
there
was
no
stopping
this
glut
of
struggle
that
heaped
itself
between
the
narrow
rims
of
the
creek
from
behind
sled
after
sled
hurled
into
the
turmoil
men
who
had
their
teams
nearly
extricated
were
overwhelmed
by
fresh
avalanches
of
dogs
each
animal
and
ripe
for
battle
it
knock
down
an
drag
out
an
plow

in
his
partner
ear
an
watch
out
for
your
knuckles
you
drag
out
an
let
me
do
the
punchin
what
happened
in
the
next
half
hour
smoke
never
distinctly
remembered
at
the
end
he
emerged
exhausted
sobbing
for
breath
his
jaw
sore
from
a
his
shoulder
aching
from
the
bruise
of
a
club
the
blood
running
warmly
down
one
leg
from
the
rip
of
a
dog
fangs
and
both
sleeves
of
his
parka
torn
to
shreds
as
in
a
dream
while
the
battle
still
raged
behind
he
helped
shorty
reharness
the
dogs
one
dying
they
cut
from
the
traces
and
in
the
darkness
they
felt
their
way
to
the
repair
of
the
disrupted
harnesses
now
you
lie
down
an
get
your
wind
back
shorty
commanded
and
through
the
darkness
the
dogs
sped
with
unabated
strength
down
mono
creek
across
the
long
and
to
the
yukon
here
at
the
junction
with
the
main
somebody
had
lighted
a
fire
and
here
shorty
said
good
bye
by
the
light
of
the
fire
as
the
sled
leaped
behind
the
flying
dogs
smoke
caught
another
of
the
unforgettable
pictures
of
the
north
land
it
was
of
shorty
swaying
and
sinking
down
limply
in
the
snow
yelling
his
parting
encouragement
one
eye
blackened
and
closed
knuckles
bruised
and
broken
and
one
arm
ripped
and
gushing
forth
a
steady
stream
of
blood
how
many
ahead
smoke
asked
as
he
dropped
his
tired
hudson
bays
and
sprang
on
the
waiting
sled
at
the
first
relay
station
i
counted
eleven
the
man
called
after
him
for
he
was
already
away
behind
the
leaping
dogs
fifteen
miles
they
were
to
carry
him
on
the
next
stage
which
would
fetch
him
to
the
mouth
of
white
river
there
were
nine
of
them
but
they
composed
his
weakest
team
the
miles
between
white
river
and
sixty
mile
he
had
broken
into
two
stages
because
of
and
here
two
of
his
heaviest
toughest
teams
were
stationed
he
lay
on
the
sled
at
full
length
holding
on
with
both
hands
whenever
the
dogs
slacked
from
topmost
speed
he
rose
to
his
knees
and
yelling
and
urging
clinging
precariously
with
one
hand
threw
his
whip
into
them
poor
team
that
it
was
he
passed
two
sleds
before
white
river
was
reached
here
at
the
a
jam
had
piled
a
barrier
allowing
the
open
water
that
formed
for
half
a
mile
below
to
freeze
smoothly
this
smooth
stretch
enabled
the
racers
to
make
flying
exchanges
of
sleds
and
down
all
the
course
they
had
placed
their
relays
below
the
jams
over
the
jam
and
out
on
to
the
smooth
smoke
tore
along
calling
loudly
billy
billy
billy
heard
and
answered
and
by
the
light
of
the
many
fires
on
the
ice
smoke
saw
a
sled
swing
in
from
the
side
and
come
abreast
its
dogs
were
fresh
and
overhauled
his
as
the
sleds
swerved
toward
each
other
he
leaped
across
and
billy
promptly
rolled
off
where
big
olaf
smoke
cried
leading
billy
voice
answered
and
the
fires
were
left
behind
and
smoke
was
again
flying
through
the
wall
of
blackness
in
the
jams
of
that
relay
where
the
way
led
across
a
chaos
of
and
where
smoke
slipped
off
the
forward
end
of
the
sled
and
with
a
toiled
behind
the
he
passed
three
sleds
accidents
had
happened
and
he
could
hear
the
men
cutting
out
dogs
and
mending
harnesses
among
the
jams
of
the
next
short
relay
into
sixty
mile
he
passed
two
more
teams
and
that
he
might
know
adequately
what
had
happened
to
them
one
of
his
own
dogs
wrenched
a
shoulder
was
unable
to
keep
up
and
was
dragged
in
the
harness
its
angered
fell
upon
it
with
their
fangs
and
smoke
was
forced
to
club
them
off
with
the
heavy
butt
of
his
whip
as
he
cut
the
injured
animal
out
he
heard
the
whining
cries
of
dogs
behind
him
and
the
voice
of
a
man
that
was
familiar
it
was
von
schroeder
smoke
called
a
warning
to
prevent
a
collision
and
the
baron
hawing
his
animals
and
swinging
on
the
went
by
a
dozen
feet
to
the
side
yet
so
impenetrable
was
the
blackness
that
smoke
heard
him
pass
but
never
saw
him
on
the
smooth
stretch
of
ice
beside
the
trading
post
at
sixty
mile
smoke
overtook
two
more
sleds
all
had
just
changed
teams
and
for
five
minutes
they
ran
abreast
each
man
on
his
knees
and
pouring
whip
and
voice
into
the
maddened
dogs
but
smoke
had
studied
out
that
portion
of
the
trail
and
now
marked
the
tall
pine
on
the
bank
that
showed
faintly
in
the
light
of
the
many
fires
below
that
pine
was
not
merely
darkness
but
an
abrupt
cessation
of
the
smooth
stretch
there
the
trail
he
knew
narrowed
to
a
single
leaning
out
ahead
he
caught
the
and
drew
his
leaping
sled
up
to
the
he
caught
the
animal
by
the
and
threw
it
with
a
snarl
of
rage
it
tried
to
slash
him
with
its
fangs
but
was
dragged
on
by
the
rest
of
the
team
its
body
proved
an
efficient
brake
and
the
two
other
teams
still
abreast
dashed
ahead
into
the
darkness
for
the
narrow
way
smoke
heard
the
crash
and
uproar
of
their
collision
released
his
wheeler
sprang
to
the
and
urged
his
team
to
the
right
into
the
soft
snow
where
the
straining
animals
wallowed
to
their
necks
it
was
exhausting
work
but
he
won
by
the
tangled
teams
and
gained
the
trail
beyond
vi
on
the
relay
out
of
sixty
mile
smoke
had
next
to
his
poorest
team
and
though
the
going
was
good
he
had
set
it
a
short
fifteen
miles
two
more
teams
would
bring
him
in
to
dawson
and
to
the
office
and
smoke
had
selected
his
best
animals
for
the
last
two
stretches
sitka
charley
himself
waited
with
the
eight
malemutes
that
would
jerk
smoke
along
for
twenty
miles
and
for
the
finish
with
a
run
was
his
own
team
the
team
he
had
had
all
winter
and
which
had
been
with
him
in
the
search
for
surprise
lake
the
two
men
he
had
left
entangled
at
sixty
mile
failed
to
overtake
him
and
on
the
other
hand
his
team
failed
to
overtake
any
of
the
three
that
still
led
his
animals
were
willing
though
they
lacked
stamina
and
speed
and
little
urging
was
needed
to
keep
them
jumping
into
it
at
their
best
there
was
nothing
for
smoke
to
do
but
to
lie
and
hold
on
now
and
again
he
would
plunge
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
circle
of
light
about
a
blazing
fire
catch
a
glimpse
of
furred
men
standing
by
harnessed
and
waiting
dogs
and
plunge
into
the
darkness
again
mile
after
mile
with
only
the
grind
and
jar
of
the
runners
in
his
ears
he
sped
on
almost
automatically
he
kept
his
place
as
the
sled
bumped
ahead
or
and
heeled
on
the
swings
and
swerves
of
the
bends
first
one
and
then
another
without
apparent
rhyme
or
reason
three
faces
limned
themselves
on
his
consciousness
joy
gastell
laughing
and
audacious
shorty
battered
and
exhausted
by
the
struggle
down
mono
creek
and
john
bellew
seamed
and
rigid
as
if
cast
in
iron
so
unrelenting
was
its
severity
and
sometimes
smoke
wanted
to
shout
aloud
to
chant
a
paean
of
savage
exultation
as
he
remembered
the
office
of
the
billow
and
the
serial
story
of
san
francisco
which
he
had
left
unfinished
along
with
the
other
fripperies
of
those
empty
days
the
grey
twilight
of
morning
was
breaking
as
he
exchanged
his
weary
dogs
for
the
eight
fresh
malemutes
lighter
animals
than
hudson
bays
they
were
capable
of
greater
speed
and
they
ran
with
the
supple
tirelessness
of
true
wolves
sitka
charley
called
out
the
order
of
the
teams
ahead
big
olaf
led
arizona
bill
was
second
and
von
schroeder
third
these
were
the
three
best
men
in
the
country
in
fact
ere
smoke
had
left
dawson
the
popular
betting
had
placed
them
in
that
order
while
they
were
racing
for
a
million
at
least
half
a
million
had
been
staked
by
others
on
the
outcome
of
the
race
no
one
had
bet
on
smoke
who
despite
his
several
known
exploits
was
still
accounted
a
chechaquo
with
much
to
learn
as
daylight
strengthened
smoke
caught
sight
of
a
sled
ahead
and
in
half
an
hour
his
own
was
leaping
at
its
tail
not
until
the
man
turned
his
head
to
exchange
greetings
did
smoke
recognize
him
as
arizona
bill
von
schroeder
had
evidently
passed
him
the
trail
ran
too
narrowly
through
the
soft
snow
and
for
another
smoke
was
forced
to
stay
in
the
rear
then
they
topped
an
and
struck
a
smooth
stretch
below
where
were
a
number
of
relay
camps
and
where
the
snow
was
packed
widely
on
his
knees
swinging
his
whip
and
yelling
smoke
drew
abreast
he
noted
that
arizona
right
arm
hung
dead
at
his
side
and
that
he
was
compelled
to
pour
leather
with
his
left
hand
awkward
as
it
was
he
had
no
hand
left
with
which
to
hold
on
and
frequently
he
had
to
cease
from
the
whip
and
clutch
to
save
himself
from
falling
off
smoke
remembered
the
scrimmage
in
the
creek
bed
at
three
below
discovery
and
understood
shorty
advice
had
been
sound
what
happened
smoke
asked
as
he
began
to
pull
ahead
i
do
know
arizona
bill
answered
i
think
i
threw
my
shoulder
out
in
the
scrapping
he
dropped
behind
very
slowly
though
when
the
last
relay
station
was
in
sight
he
was
fully
half
a
mile
in
the
rear
ahead
bunched
together
smoke
could
see
big
olaf
and
von
schroeder
again
smoke
arose
to
his
knees
and
he
lifted
his
jaded
dogs
into
a
burst
of
speed
such
as
a
man
only
can
who
has
the
proper
instinct
for
he
drew
up
close
to
the
tail
of
von
schroeder
sled
and
in
this
order
the
three
sleds
dashed
out
on
the
smooth
going
below
a
jam
where
many
men
and
many
dogs
waited
dawson
was
fifteen
miles
away
von
schroeder
with
his
relays
had
changed
five
miles
back
and
would
change
five
miles
ahead
so
he
held
on
keeping
his
dogs
at
full
leap
big
olaf
and
smoke
made
flying
changes
and
their
fresh
teams
immediately
regained
what
had
been
lost
to
the
baron
big
olaf
led
past
and
smoke
followed
into
the
narrow
trail
beyond
still
good
but
not
so
good
smoke
paraphrased
spencer
to
himself
of
von
schroeder
now
behind
he
had
no
fear
but
ahead
was
the
greatest
in
the
country
to
pass
him
seemed
impossible
again
and
again
many
times
smoke
forced
his
leader
to
the
and
each
time
big
olaf
let
out
another
link
and
drew
away
smoke
contented
himself
with
taking
the
pace
and
hung
on
grimly
the
race
was
not
lost
until
one
or
the
other
won
and
in
fifteen
miles
many
things
could
happen
three
miles
from
dawson
something
did
happen
to
smoke
surprise
big
olaf
rose
up
and
with
oaths
and
leather
proceeded
to
fetch
out
the
last
ounce
of
effort
in
his
animals
it
was
a
spurt
that
should
have
been
reserved
for
the
last
hundred
yards
instead
of
being
begun
three
miles
from
the
finish
sheer
that
it
was
smoke
followed
his
own
team
was
superb
no
dogs
on
the
yukon
had
had
harder
work
or
were
in
better
condition
besides
smoke
had
toiled
with
them
and
eaten
and
bedded
with
them
and
he
knew
each
dog
as
an
individual
and
how
best
to
win
in
to
the
animal
intelligence
and
extract
its
last
least
shred
of
willingness
they
topped
a
small
jam
and
struck
the
below
big
olaf
was
barely
fifty
feet
ahead
a
sled
shot
out
from
the
side
and
drew
in
toward
him
and
smoke
understood
big
olaf
terrific
spurt
he
had
tried
to
gain
a
lead
for
the
change
this
fresh
team
that
waited
to
jerk
him
down
the
home
stretch
had
been
a
private
surprise
of
his
even
the
men
who
had
backed
him
to
win
had
had
no
knowledge
of
it
smoke
strove
desperately
to
pass
during
the
exchange
of
sleds
lifting
his
dogs
to
the
effort
he
ate
up
the
intervening
fifty
feet
with
urging
and
pouring
of
leather
he
went
to
the
side
and
on
until
his
was
jumping
abreast
of
big
olaf
wheeler
on
the
other
side
abreast
was
the
relay
sled
at
the
speed
they
were
going
big
olaf
did
not
dare
the
flying
leap
if
he
missed
and
fell
off
smoke
would
be
in
the
lead
and
the
race
would
be
lost
big
olaf
tried
to
spurt
ahead
and
he
lifted
his
dogs
magnificently
but
smoke
leader
still
continued
to
jump
beside
big
olaf
wheeler
for
half
a
mile
the
three
sleds
tore
and
bounced
along
side
by
side
the
smooth
stretch
was
nearing
its
end
when
big
olaf
took
the
chance
as
the
flying
sleds
swerved
toward
each
other
he
leaped
and
the
instant
he
struck
he
was
on
his
knees
with
whip
and
voice
spurting
the
fresh
team
the
smooth
pinched
out
into
the
narrow
trail
and
he
jumped
his
dogs
ahead
and
into
it
with
a
lead
of
barely
a
yard
a
man
was
not
beaten
until
he
was
beaten
was
smoke
conclusion
and
drive
no
matter
how
big
olaf
failed
to
shake
him
off
no
team
smoke
had
driven
that
night
could
have
stood
such
a
killing
pace
and
kept
up
with
fresh
dogs
no
team
save
this
one
nevertheless
the
pace
was
killing
it
and
as
they
began
to
round
the
bluff
at
klondike
city
he
could
feel
the
pitch
of
strength
going
out
of
his
animals
almost
imperceptibly
they
lagged
and
foot
by
foot
big
olaf
drew
away
until
he
led
by
a
score
of
yards
a
great
cheer
went
up
from
the
population
of
klondike
city
assembled
on
the
ice
here
the
klondike
entered
the
yukon
and
half
a
mile
away
across
the
klondike
on
the
north
bank
stood
dawson
an
outburst
of
madder
cheering
arose
and
smoke
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
sled
shooting
out
to
him
he
recognized
the
splendid
animals
that
drew
it
they
were
joy
gastell
and
joy
gastell
drove
them
the
hood
of
her
parka
was
tossed
back
revealing
the
oval
of
her
face
outlined
against
her
hair
mittens
had
been
discarded
and
with
bare
hands
she
clung
to
whip
and
sled
jump
she
cried
as
her
leader
snarled
at
smoke
smoke
struck
the
sled
behind
her
it
rocked
violently
from
the
impact
of
his
body
but
she
was
full
up
on
her
knees
and
swinging
the
whip
hi
you
mush
on
chook
chook
she
was
crying
and
the
dogs
whined
and
yelped
in
eagerness
of
desire
and
effort
to
overtake
big
olaf
and
then
as
the
caught
the
tail
of
big
olaf
sled
and
yard
by
yard
drew
up
abreast
the
great
crowd
on
the
dawson
bank
went
mad
it
was
a
great
crowd
for
the
men
had
dropped
their
tools
on
all
the
creeks
and
come
down
to
see
the
outcome
of
the
race
and
a
dead
heat
at
the
end
of
a
hundred
and
ten
miles
justified
any
madness
when
you
in
the
lead
i
going
to
drop
off
joy
cried
out
over
her
shoulder
smoke
tried
to
protest
and
watch
out
for
the
dip
curve
half
way
up
the
bank
she
warned
dog
by
dog
separated
by
half
a
dozen
feet
the
two
teams
were
running
abreast
big
olaf
with
whip
and
voice
held
his
own
for
a
minute
then
slowly
an
inch
at
a
time
joy
leader
began
to
forge
past
get
ready
she
cried
to
smoke
i
going
to
leave
you
in
a
minute
get
the
whip
and
as
he
shifted
his
hand
to
clutch
the
whip
they
heard
big
olaf
roar
a
warning
but
too
late
his
incensed
at
being
passed
swerved
in
to
the
attack
his
fangs
struck
joy
leader
on
the
flank
the
rival
teams
flew
at

another
throats
the

overran
the
fighting
brutes
and
capsized
smoke
struggled
to
his
feet
and
tried
to
lift
joy
up
but
she
thrust
him
from
her
crying
go
on
foot
already
fifty
feet
in
advance
was
big
olaf
still
intent
on
finishing
the
race
smoke
obeyed
and
when
the
two
men
reached
the
foot
of
the
dawson
bank
he
was
at
the
others
heels
but
up
the
bank
big
olaf
lifted
his
body
hugely
regaining
a
dozen
feet
five
blocks
down
the
main
street
was
the
gold
recorder
office
the
street
was
packed
as
for
the
witnessing
of
a
parade
not
so
easily
this
time
did
smoke
gain
to
his
giant
rival
and
when
he
did
he
was
unable
to
pass
side
by
side
they
ran
along
the
narrow
aisle
between
the
solid
walls
of
cheering
men
now
one
now
the
other
with
great
convulsive
jerks
gained
an
inch
or
so
only
to
lose
it
immediately
after
if
the
pace
had
been
a
killing
one
for
their
dogs
the
one
they
now
set
themselves
was
no
less
so
but
they
were
racing
for
a
million
dollars
and
great
honour
in
yukon
country
the
only
outside
impression
that
came
to
smoke
on
that
last
mad
stretch
was
one
of
astonishment
that
there
should
be
so
many
people
in
the
klondike
he
had
never
seen
them
all
at
once
before
he
felt
himself
involuntarily
lag
and
big
olaf
sprang
a
full
stride
in
the
lead
to
smoke
it
seemed
that
his
heart
would
burst
while
he
had
lost
all
consciousness
of
his
legs
he
knew
they
were
flying
under
him
but
he
did
not
know
how
he
continued
to
make
them
fly
nor
how
he
put
even
greater
pressure
of
will
upon
them
and
compelled
them
again
to
carry
him
to
his
giant
competitor
side
the
open
door
of
the
recorder
office
appeared
ahead
of
them
both
men
made
a
final
futile
spurt
neither
could
draw
away
from
the
other
and
side
by
side
they
hit
the
doorway
collided
violently
and
fell
headlong
on
the
office
floor
they
sat
up
but
were
too
exhausted
to
rise
big
olaf
the
sweat
pouring
from
him
breathing
with
tremendous
painful
gasps
pawed
the
air
and
vainly
tried
to
speak
then
he
reached
out
his
hand
with
unmistakable
meaning
smoke
extended
his
and
they
shook
it
a
dead
heat
smoke
could
hear
the
recorder
saying
but
it
was
as
if
in
a
dream
and
the
voice
was
very
thin
and
very
far
away
and
all
i
can
say
is
that
you
both
win
you
have
to
divide
the
claim
between
you
you
partners
their
two
arms
pumped
up
and
down
as
they
ratified
the
decision
big
olaf
nodded
his
head
with
great
emphasis
and
spluttered
at
last
he
got
it
out
you
damn
chechaquo
was
what
he
said
but
in
the
saying
of
it
was
admiration
i
do
know
how
you
done
it
but
you
did
outside
the
great
crowd
was
noisily
massed
while
the
office
was
packing
and
jamming
smoke
and
big
olaf
essayed
to
rise
and
each
helped
the
other
to
his
feet
smoke
found
his
legs
weak
under
him
and
staggered
drunkenly
big
olaf
tottered
toward
him
i
sorry
my
dogs
jumped
yours
it
could
be
helped
smoke
panted
back
i
heard
you
yell
say
big
olaf
went
on
with
shining
eyes
that
girl
one
damn
fine
girl
eh
one
damn
fine
girl
smoke
agreed
